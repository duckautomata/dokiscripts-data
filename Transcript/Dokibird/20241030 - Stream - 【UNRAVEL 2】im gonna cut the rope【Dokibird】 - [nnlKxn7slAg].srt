1
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,700
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,300
Hello, hello.

3
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,160
Gumi doesn't know how to play this game.

4
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,060
I literally got in the call.

5
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,220
I was like, hey, Gumi, you know, this is like remote play, right?

6
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,260
And she was like, what?

7
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,260
By the way, at that time, we had like five minutes till the stream was about to start.

8
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,200
So, it was supposed to start.

9
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,920
So then, now we're here.

10
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:25,940
Look, guys, see, you guys were like, I can't believe you guys didn't test the stream out before... test the game out before the stream.

11
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,720
Gumi didn't even know until I told her, like...

12
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,320
I just thought it was a cute game.

13
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,140
It's like not my fault, man.

14
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,520
This was her game suggestion, too, by the way, guys.

15
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,530
We all know I don't.

16
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:51,990
Yesterday was a fluke when it came to testing video games because, like, dyed-haired Doki was a different person.

17
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,950
But today, I've reverted back to what I'm more known to do.

18
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:05,850
I saw more messages about how people were like, oh, man, you gotta test out Call of Duty because, like, because all this shit is gonna happen.

19
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,270
So, like, I got super paranoid.

20
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,410
I was like, oh, maybe I should test out Call of Duty.

21
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,350
But on Rival, too, I was just like, I don't know.

22
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:17,550
I was just like, well, seems like a normal co-op game.

23
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,670
That's what I thought!

24
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:26,530
And then I, like, downloaded the game and it says, like, only local co-op.

25
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:30,710
I mean, I could have messaged Gumi, like, a lot earlier about this because I found out last night.

26
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,430
But instead, like, I...

27
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:37,970
But that was my fault because I assumed you knew.

28
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:45,210
I just assumed you knew as well when you were installing the game.

29
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:51,350
Literally, it's in the Steam store tag as local co-op, Gumi.

30
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,430
I don't know how to read.

31
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,530
Can we swap games?

32
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,550
No, it's too late!

33
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,330
I got a thumbnail made and everything!

34
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,410
It's too late, Gumi!

35
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:07,910
You gotta figure this out!

36
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,730
Okay, why don't you launch and invite me?

37
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,310
Why don't you launch and invite me?

38
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,190
You volunteered.

39
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,450
You were like, oh, okay.

40
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,290
I did volunteer.

41
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,450
I did not volunteer.

42
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:17,350
You volunteered.

43
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,270
You volunteered.

44
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,330
I did not volunteer.

45
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:19,770
I just opened the game first.

46
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:20,710
You volunteered.

47
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:24,250
You were like, alright, I guess I'll figure this remote play.

48
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,330
I thought you figured it out!

49
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:33,170
Sorry, I might have made her really loud, but I lowered the volume a little bit.

50
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,250
I saw that she was in the red.

51
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,650
I was like, oh, that's loud.

52
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,430
Sorry, Gumi, the thumbnail's already made.

53
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:50,890
I can't just, you know, just swap games willy-nilly like that.

54
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,450
I'm not on Twitch right now.

55
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,090
I gotta commit to the game I'm playing.

56
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,570
Oh, my God.

57
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,750
How do we commit if we can't even play it?

58
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,090
What do you mean other people?

59
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,050
Watch a YouTube video right now.

60
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:05,330
I hate watching YouTube.

61
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,250
I hate watching YouTube.

62
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,430
You watch a YouTube video, right?

63
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:09,190
What do you mean?

64
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,430
I'm literally on YouTube.

65
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,300
That means you hate me.

66
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,490
You haven't even modded me.

67
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:19,100
Every time I tune in, I see I'm modded.

68
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:29,960
Look, look, look, you gotta be a special person to be a mod.

69
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,220
How to play Unraveled 2 Online Co-op.

70
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,140
Just fucking look up a YouTube tutorial anyway.

71
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,060
Just look up it.

72
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,380
It's remote play.

73
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,200
Just set up remote play.

74
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,080
I'm shift-tabbing.

75
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm shift-tabbing and it won't open.

76
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,640
You must have turned it off.

77
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,840
Did you turn off shift-tab?

78
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,820
You can turn that off?

79
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,320
Yeah.

80
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,660
Well, no, I didn't.

81
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,630
Remote play to get a feature.

82
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,890
Okay, guys.

83
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:08,470
Okay.

84
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,610
Okay, guys.

85
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,790
Guys, we need a step-by-step guide.

86
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:16,630
Friends list.

87
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:18,410
Doki.

88
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,590
Remote play together.

89
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,770
Oh my god, you figured it out.

90
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,370
Oh my god, that wasn't so difficult, was it?

91
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,670
Bitch, you did nothing.

92
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:28,970
You did absolutely nothing.

93
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,950
You just sat there.

94
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:30,890
You just sat there and did nothing.

95
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:38,530
I gave you the suggestion to look up a tutorial on how to do remote play.

96
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,750
I gave you that suggestion.

97
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:41,990
I would say evil things to you.

98
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,130
You can type it out and I'll read it.

99
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,850
Okay, hold on.

100
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:46,690
Give me a second.

101
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:53,490
All I'm saying is that, you know, you could have easily...

102
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,010
Oh my god, you know what Gumi typed out?

103
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:02,030
Gumi wrote, you're the best friend, the most best friend I've ever known.

104
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:08,930
And I'm so glad that we're friends and that you wanted to collab with me.

105
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:11,870
That's crazy.

106
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,030
I don't think I said all that.

107
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:16,110
Oh my god, you typed all that so fast, Gumi.

108
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,770
You're such a speed typer.

109
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:19,510
Yeah, I played MapleStory.

110
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,990
Yeah, I played MapleStory.

111
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:28,010
Yeah, I can't believe you were able to type that entire three sentences in all this typing.

112
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,030
That's crazy, actually.

113
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:37,370
Hey guys, is the volume better now for Gumi?

114
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:40,270
Is she not that loud anymore?

115
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:43,350
I hate you.

116
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,710
Wait, what did I say?

117
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,810
It was just sound audio balancing.

118
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,210
I don't know, you just filled me with anger.

119
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:51,410
And love?

120
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,450
Cause that's an abusive relationship then.

121
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,630
Don't worry, don't worry, I'm gonna money...

122
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,330
I'm gonna love...

123
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:10,270
Don't worry, I'm gonna love bomb you and then you'll love me back.

124
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:16,850
Hold on.

125
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,720
Type in chat.

126
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,320
I'm waiting for you to start the game!

127
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,060
It says, please hold.

128
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:32,980
Gumi, input is temporarily disabled while the host is busy.

129
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:37,500
I can't even start the game!

130
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,740
Gumi, you have another collab to go to.

131
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:44,380
We're not leaving until we finish the game, Gumi.

132
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,080
I'm literally jumping around in the game!

133
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,980
It says, your input is temporarily disabled while the host is busy.

134
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,980
What does that mean?

135
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,080
You have the remote play thing still up.

136
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,160
What does that mean?

137
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:57,720
I don't know.

138
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:58,880
It just says, please hold.

139
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,980
Input is temporarily disabled while the host is busy.

140
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,300
What are you doing, Gumi?

141
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,760
I'm in the game!

142
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,220
I'm in the game jumping around!

143
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,620
What are you doing?

144
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,540
I can't even!

145
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:13,480
I can't even do anything.

146
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,820
I can't even do it.

147
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,780
Where's your remote play?

148
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,560
Where's your remote play?

149
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,980
It says you're not even playing the game on Steam.

150
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:20,920
I just sent you.

151
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,240
Input is temporarily disabled.

152
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,580
Oh my god, you cancelled.

153
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,340
Now I'm out of here.

154
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,620
Okay.

155
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,280
Now I'm back.

156
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,200
It says, you can throw the mouse cursor on and off.

157
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,480
You're now connected playing Unravel 2.

158
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,400
I said, let's go.

159
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,280
Please hold.

160
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,580
Input is temporarily disabled while the host is busy.

161
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,140
What are you doing?

162
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:42,520
I'm busy.

163
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,020
What are you doing?

164
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,140
I'm just in the game.

165
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,760
Because I am an adult, I will google the solution.

166
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,080
Please hold.

167
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,560
Please hold.

168
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:57,920
What does it say?

169
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,700
Input is temporarily disabled.

170
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,360
Input is temporarily disabled.

171
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,380
While the host is busy.

172
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,480
Okay.

173
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,720
I don't know.

174
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,380
I'm reading it.

175
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,600
Try to install it.

176
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,880
Reboot PC and uninstall beta.

177
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:27,840
What?

178
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,600
There's no way.

179
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,360
There's no way.

180
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,900
Try enabling Steam Overlay.

181
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,580
Try enabling Steam Overlay if you can.

182
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,900
All you had to do was enable overlay on the host device.

183
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,340
Once I did this, I stopped getting me.

184
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,800
I tested it several times.

185
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:45,360
Wait.

186
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:45,900
What?

187
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,800
What?

188
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,600
I'm scratching my head.

189
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,700
I'm confused.

190
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,640
What?

191
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,000
This is your fault.

192
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,320
You said you're an adult.

193
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,920
You said you're an adult.

194
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,400
This is...

195
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,040
This is...

196
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,960
You have to enable Steam Overlay while in-game.

197
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,340
That's literally what it says.

198
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,920
I don't think you have it enabled.

199
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,480
This is it.

200
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,500
This is it.

201
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,160
This is what it says.

202
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,620
Enable Steam Overlay.

203
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,900
This is your fault.

204
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,780
You picked the game.

205
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,420
Now we can't swap games because I made my thumbnail.

206
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,080
What do you mean?

207
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,920
What other co-op game?

208
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,640
We were here.

209
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:48,370
What?

210
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,890
I hate you.

211
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,690
It's enabled.

212
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,050
It's been enabled.

213
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,890
I haven't disabled it.

214
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:01,490
How come you can't enable it right now?

215
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:04,010
Why can't you enable it in your game right now?

216
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:06,950
Right now, I'm literally enabling it.

217
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,010
I'm shift-tabbing it too.

218
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:11,190
I can see it perfectly fine.

219
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,190
Why don't you invite me?

220
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,430
I'll do it.

221
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,070
I said this earlier!

222
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:17,950
I don't remember you saying that.

223
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,590
When did you say that?

224
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,890
This was your game suggestion.

225
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:45,330
I'm not getting into the game first!

226
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:46,670
Holy shit!

227
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:47,870
Calm down!

228
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,010
Oh my god!

229
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,110
It's just a video game.

230
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:57,850
Alright.

231
00:12:58,890 --> 00:12:59,990
Oh my gosh.

232
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,350
Wait, okay.

233
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:03,410
Let's see.

234
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,770
Remote play.

235
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,930
I've slapped my head into the back of my chair like three times already.

236
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:09,870
Are you okay?

237
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:10,650
It's over for me.

238
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:13,830
Alright.

239
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,510
Did you get the invite?

240
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:18,870
Did you get the invite?

241
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:20,790
Yes.

242
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:21,850
Play game.

243
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:23,610
Nice.

244
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:25,550
Okay.

245
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:27,970
Alright.

246
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,050
Do you see the game?

247
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:31,990
Let's go!

248
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:33,410
Yes, I see the game.

249
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,550
Do you see the game?

250
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,590
Yes, I see the game.

251
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,630
Wait, did you choose the controller?

252
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,950
Well, it said I had to choose the controller.

253
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:43,770
Wait, no.

254
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,370
Wait, no you don't.

255
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:51,130
Wait.

256
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:54,130
Have you been trying to do remote play in the game?

257
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,490
Have you been doing remote play in the game?

258
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,330
When you go through the first chapter?

259
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,250
Is this what you did?

260
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:00,530
What?

261
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,350
I'm literally in the selection screen.

262
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:04,670
Like the save slot.

263
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:05,530
And you see it.

264
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,190
You see the save slot selection screen.

265
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,970
Were you doing remote play when you were in the chapter?

266
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,810
I told you that there was a cutscene.

267
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,410
Do you want me to go to the cutscene?

268
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:15,270
Go back.

269
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,150
Oh my god, this is...

270
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,950
This is why I couldn't see anything.

271
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,090
Because you were in the game.

272
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:23,110
You had to wait until...

273
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:28,090
You had to basically do remote play in the save slot selection.

274
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:29,870
Do your remote play.

275
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:30,770
Do your remote play.

276
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:31,950
I can't believe.

277
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,070
Do your remote play.

278
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,790
Because I need to use the controller.

279
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,090
Look, we figured it out.

280
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,910
I should have taught you.

281
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:43,950
I should have held your hand.

282
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:46,370
I don't do remote play.

283
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:47,830
This is my first time to

284
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,140
be chapter.

285
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,300
When did I say that?

286
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,540
Are you in the main menu?

287
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,720
Okay, why is it still says...

288
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,560
Please hold input is temporarily disabled while the host is busy.

289
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,920
Why is it you?

290
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:08,820
Why?

291
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,800
I don't know.

292
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,600
Why are you?

293
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,320
Please hold input is temporarily disabled while the host is busy.

294
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,920
But it works on my end.

295
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,720
What's wrong?

296
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,280
What's wrong?

297
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,420
Alright, Gumi.

298
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,380
It's okay, Gumi.

299
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,840
I know that...

300
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,480
This is really difficult for you.

301
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,200
But that's why I'm here.

302
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,660
You sound like a mad man.

303
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,080
That's good.

304
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,280
That was my intention.

305
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:03,560
Luckily, I'm here to teach you how to do this.

306
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,640
So you're very lucky that I'm here for you.

307
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,000
I feel like I'm talking to my ex-boyfriend.

308
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,860
Wait, before you...

309
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,860
Don't select controller.

310
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,420
Don't select controller.

311
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,020
Do not select...

312
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,200
Please, I beg of you.

313
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,020
Do not select controller.

314
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,060
That's all I ask for you.

315
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,460
Like...

316
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,540
That's literally all I ask.

317
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:32,540
It says...

318
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,200
Make sure you have a controller.

319
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:34,820
No, no, no.

320
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,560
You don't need to.

321
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,360
You don't need to make sure you have a controller.

322
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,580
Then what?

323
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,520
Then what?

324
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,020
Do I just press let's go?

325
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,400
No, no, no.

326
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,580
Give me a sec.

327
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,860
You just gotta be a little patient.

328
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,500
You just gotta...

329
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,820
Why are you talking about patience to me?

330
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,280
You just gotta be a little patient.

331
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:58,900
You know what I mean?

332
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,760
I'm figuring out this...

333
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,020
Alongside with you.

334
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,150
I'm gonna throw up.

335
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,310
Wait, wait, wait.

336
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,850
Cancel your remote play real quick.

337
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:14,530
I hate you.

338
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:15,650
Cancel it real quick.

339
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:16,850
Okay.

340
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:18,830
Okay.

341
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:22,470
We have a little bit of an issue.

342
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:23,210
Give me a sec.

343
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,450
Guys, we're almost there.

344
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,690
We're almost figuring it out.

345
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:41,510
We're learning this with you guys.

346
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:42,870
Stop!

347
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,390
Stop gaslighting them!

348
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,890
What the fuck?

349
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:49,570
You just gaslight...

350
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:52,470
You just gaslight Chance when you're like...

351
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,410
Okay, Scooby's had enough.

352
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,770
It's your turn, chat.

353
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:56,650
No, no, no.

354
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,510
I would never.

355
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,970
I would never do that to my chat.

356
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,390
I would...

357
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,970
I would never...

358
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:07,430
Me?

359
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,110
Gaslight my own...

360
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,350
My own chat?

361
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,890
What do you think I am?

362
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:17,970
Okay.

363
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:19,710
Let's see.

364
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,710
I could be playing Deadlock right now.

365
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:25,990
You suggested this game.

366
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,770
You literally...

367
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:35,630
I suggested multiple games and this is the only one you said okay to.

368
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:36,270
No, no, no.

369
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:37,570
That's not true.

370
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:38,670
That is not true.

371
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:40,550
I would never do something like that, chat.

372
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,530
She's just...

373
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:46,590
Having a little moment right now.

374
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:52,470
Yeah, it's that time of the month, isn't it, chat?

375
00:18:59,130 --> 00:18:59,510
What?

376
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:04,770
I meant she's just having a little good moment right now.

377
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:06,430
It's her day.

378
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,950
It's her day.

379
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,670
It's her day.

380
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:11,630
Okay.

381
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:12,810
Alright.

382
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,870
Because I am a good person.

383
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,810
I decided...

384
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:20,270
I decided...

385
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,010
I don't want a controller.

386
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:24,150
I don't want a controller.

387
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,630
Let's see.

388
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,370
Okay, wait.

389
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:36,930
Yeah, see?

390
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:37,230
See?

391
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,170
That's what I meant!

392
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,490
How do I...

393
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:42,370
Swap controllers...

394
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,830
On remote play?

395
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:46,410
Okay.

396
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:47,930
Swap controllers.

397
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,450
But you can...

398
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:50,450
When using...

399
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:51,430
Okay.

400
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,630
Wait, that I actually don't know?

401
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:57,850
Oh.

402
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:01,870
Wait.

403
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:02,830
There's no way.

404
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:03,010
Wait.

405
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:06,130
How to switch remote play controls?

406
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:07,770
Oh.

407
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:09,050
Alright.

408
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:09,810
You know what?

409
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,090
I can do mouse and keyboard.

410
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,270
It's too late!

411
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:18,970
Alright, do you see the main menu?

412
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,410
No, I don't see anything!

413
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:23,170
You don't see the main menu anymore?

414
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,090
I said what did we do?

415
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:30,830
I said...

416
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,010
I see the main menu now.

417
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,470
Okay, no, I turned it off.

418
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:35,250
I just turned it off.

419
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:43,410
Why did I...

420
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,370
I didn't know!

421
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:48,090
The first time I put the game up...

422
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:50,330
would be the time it actually worked!

423
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,290
Okay, wait.

424
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,210
I can figure this out.

425
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,970
Don't worry, guys.

426
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,050
As the...

427
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:06,850
As the gamer here...

428
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,530
I can figure this out.

429
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:09,390
Alright.

430
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,110
We're putting this game up for...

431
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,310
the seventh time!

432
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:20,850
Why are you crying?

433
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,050
Why are you...

434
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:25,530
Why are you crying?

435
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,990
What's going on?

436
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,310
What's going on?

437
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:33,130
Who hurt you?

438
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:36,670
Because I know it's not me.

439
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,770
Who hurt you?

440
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:43,570
Who hurt you?

441
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,650
You did!

442
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:46,210
Me?

443
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:47,830
How did I hurt you?

444
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,470
You and Steam Remote Play did!

445
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,090
You wanted to play this game!

446
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,350
What do you want from me?

447
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,290
I want Chikawa!

448
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,550
I want Chikawa!

449
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,350
What do you want from me?

450
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,590
I don't know what you want from me.

451
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:07,570
I want Chikawa!

452
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,790
I want...

453
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,790
I'm trying to be his friend!

454
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,250
Oh my god!

455
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,610
I'm restarting Steam.

456
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:21,130
I'm fucking restarting Steam.

457
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,370
I'm fucking...

458
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:25,990
I'm fucking turning this car around right now.

459
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:27,170
Oh my god!

460
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,290
Why did I restart Steam?

461
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,350
Because if I restart Steam, I disappear!

462
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,410
Okay guys, I'm going to disappear for a sec.

463
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,450
I forgot.

464
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:39,430
If I restart Steam, I disappear.

465
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:44,470
Everything is fine.

466
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:46,470
Everything is fine.

467
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:55,290
I'm doing my best here.

468
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:58,550
I'm doing my best to support this family right now.

469
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:04,230
I'm doing my 9 to 5 at the moment.

470
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,570
This should work, right?

471
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:12,210
This should work now.

472
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,450
Right?

473
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,110
How come like...

474
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,350
No, now I can...

475
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:19,910
Oh, I can!

476
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:21,110
I did my Steam overlay!

477
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:22,550
I did it!

478
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:25,590
So that means...

479
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:28,490
I should be able...

480
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,890
to...

481
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:31,850
remote play with you.

482
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,930
And then...

483
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:36,070
And then...

484
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:36,930
Don't do anything!

485
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,010
Alright, you have...

486
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:41,550
You have keyboard now, right?

487
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:42,530
You have...

488
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:42,690
Yeah?

489
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:44,890
See?

490
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,750
Look at that.

491
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,650
Do you see this?

492
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,030
Okay, not chat.

493
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:51,670
Not you.

494
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,090
Do you see this?

495
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,490
Do you see it?

496
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:58,830
Yes, I see the game.

497
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,030
Do you see the game?

498
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:00,990
Okay, good.

499
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,630
I see the game.

500
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:06,910
Okay, now that you see the game...

501
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:09,270
I'm gonna put the game on my screen.

502
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:10,890
Okay.

503
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,930
You see the game, right?

504
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,270
Yes, I see the game.

505
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,150
Okay, are you happy?

506
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,390
Are you happy?

507
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:26,830
Okay.

508
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:27,810
Alright.

509
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:31,630
Here we go.

510
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,890
Are you ready?

511
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,570
Are you ready?

512
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:38,550
Alright, we figured it out.

513
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:42,850
See, guys?

514
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:44,550
We don't need couple's counseling.

515
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:51,370
We don't need couple's counseling.

516
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:52,050
We're fine.

517
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,830
Everything is fixable.

518
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:57,150
Well, I don't need to be fixed.

519
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:02,450
It's like actual couple's counseling.

520
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,630
Okay, you're gonna make a great husband.

521
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:13,810
That's true!

522
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:17,970
She's crying tears of joy, guys.

523
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:21,330
She's crying tears of joy.

524
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,990
Am I the red one or are you the red one?

525
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:29,670
Like, who's the one that's dying in the ocean right now?

526
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:31,730
I hope it's you.

527
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:38,750
Oh my god!

528
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:45,410
Someone in my chat was like, Your Fuki has battered wife syndrome!

529
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:47,790
Holy fuck!

530
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:49,910
What is battered wife syndrome?

531
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:51,330
Don't look it up!

532
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,490
Don't look it up!

533
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:53,670
That's not you.

534
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,350
That's me.

535
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:56,550
I'm the blue one.

536
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,210
No, don't look it up, Gumi!

537
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:01,250
Don't look it up!

538
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:03,930
It's like when I didn't know what J-O-I meant.

539
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:06,930
Wait, what's J-O-I?

540
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:10,850
Don't look it up!

541
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:17,790
I learned it like last week from white men.

542
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,150
Oh, hey, we're connected.

543
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:22,910
I'm gonna cut the rope.

544
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:26,130
I hope you do.

545
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:26,770
I hope you do.

546
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:31,630
This is couples therapy right now.

547
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,370
Wait, what are you doing?

548
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:40,930
Why are you changing your...

549
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:42,550
That's not fair!

550
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,950
Wait, how did you do that?

551
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:52,010
I figured some things out while we...

552
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,530
Wait, I can't... Oh no, I can't...

553
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,990
I can't use my controller?

554
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:58,450
Then what's the point?

555
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:03,030
Wait, why can't I use my controller?

556
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,050
No, we swap!

557
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:04,750
We swap!

558
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,370
You have... We swap!

559
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:07,850
What?

560
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:09,390
We swap!

561
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:10,630
We swap characters!

562
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,370
We can only move one at a time!

563
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:13,990
There's no way!

564
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:14,970
No!

565
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,290
Can you not move?

566
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:19,510
No.

567
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:21,230
What do we do?

568
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,950
I think it's a taking turns co-op.

569
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:23,930
We take turns.

570
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:24,710
There's no way!

571
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:26,190
No, that can't be true!

572
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:27,170
No!

573
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:28,430
That's not right!

574
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:29,310
That's how much...

575
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,430
The chat said that's not right!

576
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:32,790
Well, I wouldn't know because I've never played.

577
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:35,730
That's... How do we... Guys, we fucked up!

578
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:38,490
Wait, wait!

579
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,810
Oh no, we're... Guys, we...

580
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:45,090
We fucked up!

581
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:52,390
No, they're saying we're supposed to... Oh my god, how did we fuck up?

582
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:55,430
Okay, I thought we figured this out!

583
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:57,990
How did we... Okay, I'm looking at our report play.

584
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:02,170
How did we... How did we manage to fuck this up?

585
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:04,470
Okay.

586
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:06,250
Okay.

587
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:11,070
Okay, wait, wait, I figured it out!

588
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:12,070
I figured it out!

589
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:12,410
Okay.

590
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:13,890
I figured it out.

591
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,250
Okay, okay, okay.

592
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:16,410
Okay.

593
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:19,170
Okay, can you move?

594
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:19,490
Okay.

595
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:20,490
Unbind.

596
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:21,330
Unbind.

597
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:22,530
Unbind.

598
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:23,870
Oh no.

599
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:29,890
Give me a sec.

600
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:32,850
I'm taking away your rights to move.

601
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,470
Chill!

602
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:36,730
Calm down!

603
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:39,030
Calm down!

604
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,030
Okay,

605
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,720
I need you to calm down!

606
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,100
No, no, no.

607
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,600
Do I need an Xbox controller?

608
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,860
I'm on my PlayStation.

609
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,820
I don't have an Xbox... Wait, I do have an Xbox controller.

610
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,420
No, no, I think it's the controller.

611
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,160
I think it's the controller.

612
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,220
Give me a sec.

613
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,860
I need to find...

614
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,640
Where did I put my Xbox controller?

615
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,820
Oh my gosh, it's rustling.

616
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,040
I can feel it.

617
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,560
It has to be the controller.

618
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,060
What else could it be?

619
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,160
Wait, where is the controller?

620
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:35,640
Give me a sec.

621
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,960
I gotta get...

622
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,160
I'm using a PlayStation controller.

623
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,480
Give me a sec.

624
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,060
Help me entertain the chat while I find it.

625
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:10,140
Okay, I have an idea.

626
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,320
Do you have an Xbox controller?

627
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,820
Do you have... Plug that in!

628
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:17,940
Plug that in!

629
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,940
I have a bootleg Xbox controller.

630
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:20,340
It's fine.

631
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,500
It's an Xbox.

632
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,680
I think that's it.

633
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,640
I think we just need an Xbox controller.

634
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,860
I don't know where I packed it.

635
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,360
Can we get a man in here?

636
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,400
Can we get a man in here?

637
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,100
Can we get a man in here to mansplain?

638
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,700
We can fix this!

639
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,920
We can fix this together!

640
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,520
Goobie, goobie, goobie, goobie.

641
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,640
Just get an Xbox controller.

642
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,020
I have an Xbox controller!

643
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,380
Get your Xbox controller and all our problems will be solved.

644
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,160
That's literally it.

645
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,560
That's literally the one thing that's holding us back.

646
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,740
I figured it out.

647
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,660
It's cause we didn't get an... We don't have an Xbox controller.

648
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,500
I figured it out.

649
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,640
Oh wait, I have one.

650
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,920
I got an Xbox controller.

651
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,020
You don't have to...

652
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,460
It's fine.

653
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:01,980
No, no, no.

654
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,060
I got the Xbox controller.

655
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:03,700
It's fine.

656
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,020
It's fine.

657
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:05,560
I got it.

658
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,460
I figured it out.

659
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,800
I got the...

660
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,060
It's okay.

661
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:18,040
I figured it out.

662
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:23,040
I'm so glad people still play this game.

663
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:23,880
It's pretty underrated.

664
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:28,140
We will get this to work.

665
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,720
I swear to god.

666
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:34,800
We're gonna figure this out right here.

667
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,400
Guys, I'm gonna look up a... Give me a second.

668
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,140
I'm gonna look up a YouTube.

669
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,880
How to remote play...

670
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,340
How to play co-op.

671
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,820
Guys, you wanna watch a video with me?

672
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,900
You watch this with me.

673
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,640
We're gonna figure this out together.

674
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,180
It's quick and easy.

675
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,660
We're 39 minutes deep.

676
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,060
What do you mean quick and easy?

677
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:06,900
Okay.

678
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,560
Alright.

679
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,180
Remote play together.

680
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,280
And then...

681
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,260
Wait, that's it?

682
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,320
Wait, how do we assign controls?

683
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,640
How do we assign controls?

684
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,920
Guys, it wasn't quick and easy as I thought.

685
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,140
I don't want a YouTube video.

686
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,460
I don't want a YouTube video.

687
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:38,260
It wasn't... It wasn't as easy as I thought it was gonna be.

688
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,960
Guys, we're gonna figure this out.

689
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,660
We're a team.

690
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,280
I'm gonna redo remote play, okay?

691
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,300
I'm gonna kick you out of remote play, okay?

692
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:53,300
I'm gonna kick you out of remote play right now, okay?

693
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,460
And then...

694
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,060
And then...

695
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,420
No, we're gonna figure this out, guys.

696
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,840
We're a team.

697
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,880
We can do this.

698
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:11,600
Okay.

699
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,260
Okay.

700
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,160
Guys.

701
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,400
When we figure this out, you guys are gonna, like, quickly celebrate, okay?

702
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,280
This is, like, our character arc right now.

703
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:26,180
By being able to do remote play for this game...

704
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:32,780
We basically unlocked a milestone in our career.

705
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:36,680
Like, nothing can stop us after that, if you think about it.

706
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,380
Like, if you...

707
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,060
Gumi, if you think about it.

708
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,240
Like, nothing in life can stop us.

709
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,540
Like, we literally unlocked...

710
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,560
Unlocked, like, a new way of being.

711
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:48,960
Okay.

712
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,120
Okay.

713
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:50,960
Don't worry.

714
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,240
I'm just trying to press anything to play.

715
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,820
Why is my controller not responding to this game?

716
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:58,700
Like, why?

717
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,040
Guys.

718
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,100
Oh, there you go.

719
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:05,840
Guys.

720
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:06,540
Guys.

721
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:06,860
Guys.

722
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,220
Okay.

723
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:07,940
Alright.

724
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:08,340
Alright.

725
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,300
I figured it out.

726
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,460
I figured it out.

727
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:12,580
Alright.

728
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,020
Alright.

729
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,260
Gumi, are you alive?

730
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,420
Gumi, I figured it out.

731
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:16,740
Gumi.

732
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,740
I figured it out.

733
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,160
Okay.

734
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:19,920
Alright.

735
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:20,800
Get in here.

736
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,520
Get in here.

737
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,060
I think I actually disassociated.

738
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,820
I, like, just stared at my screen.

739
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,440
I figured it out.

740
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,940
It was Xbox.

741
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,800
It was Xbox all along.

742
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:30,660
Oh, wait.

743
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,120
I'm frozen.

744
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:31,360
Gumi.

745
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,120
What do you know?

746
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,180
I just stared at my screen and...

747
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,420
I don't know.

748
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,640
I just started breathing manually.

749
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:40,520
My...

750
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,080
My fever just crashed.

751
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:42,960
Gumi is...

752
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,100
Gumi is...

753
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,420
Guys.

754
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:49,800
Guys.

755
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,780
We're figuring this out.

756
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:51,960
Guys.

757
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:53,820
But...

758
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:54,940
But I figured it out.

759
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,620
I actually figured it out for real.

760
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,260
Like...

761
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,600
Like, it's...

762
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,740
It's over.

763
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:00,720
It's so over.

764
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,260
For...

765
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,560
It's okay.

766
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,460
You're gonna be okay.

767
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,860
You're gonna be okay.

768
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,120
Guys, give me a second.

769
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:10,820
I need...

770
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,720
We're fixing one problem at a time.

771
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,000
There's a lot of problems.

772
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:17,020
We gotta fix one thing at a time, guys.

773
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,440
One thing at a time.

774
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:20,500
Okay.

775
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,080
No, I did figure it out, though.

776
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,120
I did figure it out.

777
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:23,560
I just...

778
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,220
I'm just trying to figure...

779
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:25,800
I just need...

780
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,040
Just remember, this was your idea.

781
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,100
Just...

782
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:34,600
But...

783
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,680
Because I'm an adult here, I...

784
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,900
I fixed the problem.

785
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,880
Are you okay?

786
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,560
Are you okay?

787
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,320
Did you say something?

788
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,240
I...

789
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,720
I figured it out!

790
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,380
I actually...

791
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,620
I literally figured it out.

792
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,260
I figured it out.

793
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:55,520
Okay.

794
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,260
But I need to figure out my other problems first.

795
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,000
I need...

796
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,500
There's other...

797
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,420
There's other problems here right now.

798
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,180
There's...

799
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,540
She's going...

800
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:12,000
I think Unravel 2 is, like, breaking my computer.

801
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,820
I'm just...

802
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,060
Don't worry.

803
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,600
Don't worry.

804
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,240
Don't worry.

805
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,080
You're gonna see...

806
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:29,740
Guys, guys.

807
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,540
It's gonna be crazy when you see I fixed this.

808
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,440
It's gonna...

809
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:33,740
Actually...

810
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:34,760
Oh my god.

811
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,820
It's gonna be crazy.

812
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:36,280
Okay.

813
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:36,940
Alright.

814
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:37,900
Okay.

815
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,320
By the way, my preview...

816
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,780
My OBS preview doesn't work anymore.

817
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:41,960
So, like, I assume it's...

818
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,880
I assume it's working.

819
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:43,560
Alright.

820
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,060
You ready?

821
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,060
You ready, Goonie?

822
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:48,120
Are you ready to see something magical?

823
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,020
Are you...

824
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:50,520
Okay.

825
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,400
Are you ready?

826
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,160
Can you...

827
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:53,780
Are you ready?

828
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,600
It's gonna be so magical.

829
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,420
Okay.

830
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:57,920
Okay.

831
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,020
And then...

832
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,600
And then watch this.

833
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:04,500
Move.

834
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:05,460
Wait.

835
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:07,820
Wait.

836
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,960
Why is my game paused?

837
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,120
My game froze.

838
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:10,460
Wait.

839
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,380
Why did my game...

840
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,800
Why did my game crash?

841
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:14,900
Why...

842
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,700
Goonie, what did you do?

843
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,380
My game crashed.

844
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,740
I'm just sitting here.

845
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,180
I'm just sitting here.

846
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,500
I'm just sitting here.

847
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,280
I didn't even do a thing.

848
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,260
Why did my game crash?

849
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,120
Okay.

850
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:34,420
Wait.

851
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,420
I figured it out.

852
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:35,700
Wait.

853
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:35,840
Wait.

854
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,980
I'm gonna close the game.

855
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:37,920
I'm gonna...

856
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,780
Close it?

857
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,380
It's 15th time.

858
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,760
You said I figured it out.

859
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:42,660
No.

860
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,200
No, Goonie.

861
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,220
For real.

862
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,440
I need a...

863
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:47,920
Okay.

864
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,760
I'm gonna force quit Unravel 2 real quick.

865
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:54,500
I'm gonna force quit Unravel 2.

866
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:55,660
Oh my god.

867
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,980
It's breaking my PC.

868
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:58,820
Wait.

869
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,020
Where's Unravel 2?

870
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,200
Wait.

871
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,500
Where did it go?

872
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,060
How do I force quit it when I can't see it?

873
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:06,820
Okay.

874
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,060
It's fine.

875
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,220
Everything is...

876
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,960
Can you please contact your thumbnail artist?

877
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:12,680
No.

878
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:12,980
No.

879
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,280
No.

880
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:13,560
No.

881
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:13,740
No.

882
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:13,900
No.

883
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,480
No.

884
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:14,960
No.

885
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:15,200
No.

886
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:15,300
No.

887
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:15,380
No.

888
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:15,440
No.

889
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:15,560
No.

890
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:15,880
No.

891
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,000
No.

892
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,360
Oh, this is a bit late by the way.

893
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,080
No, no, no, no.

894
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,860
This is not too late.

895
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,020
You can still replay the game.

896
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,640
No, no, no, we are committed!

897
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,020
I don't want to be committed.

898
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,060
Oh, you don't want to be committed?

899
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:29,880
What happened?

900
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,160
That's not what therapy is supposed to do!

901
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,440
Therapy is supposed to...

902
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,800
Therapy is supposed to solve our marital problems.

903
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:38,820
What do you mean?

904
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,100

After 48 minutes stuck here, you're willing to just give up on us like that?

920
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:06,510
What would our therapist say?

My input is temporarily disabled!

922
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:23,190

932
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:02,330
And then you brought up this game.

933
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:07,010
You brought up this game.

934
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:07,850
Okay.

935
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:10,050
Alright, move.

936
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:11,830
Move.

937
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:13,050
Input is temporarily disabled.

938
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:16,350
Move.

939
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:18,470
Input is temporarily disabled.

940
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:19,510
Oh my god.

941
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:27,590
I don't know what you want me to do!

942
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:29,430
I've just been sat here.

943
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:31,250
I've literally just been sat here.

944
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:40,350
I don't know what to do with you.

945
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:43,090
What did I do?

946
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:44,890
What did I do?

947
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:46,650
I don't know.

948
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:51,010
I've done nothing.

949
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:53,410
I've just joined the Steam gameplay.

950
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:54,970
And I'm just sat here.

951
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:56,610
I was waiting for my turn.

952
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:57,710
I've done nothing.

953
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:00,890
I don't know what to do.

954
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:02,530
I don't know what to do.

955
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:05,430
I don't know what to tell you.

956
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:06,530
Okay.

957
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:09,870
Can you move now?

958
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,030
It's enabled.

959
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:13,790
I can't move.

960
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:16,410
You're moving.

961
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:18,010
Oh my god.

962
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:20,610
Okay.

963
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:22,330
Oh my god, we did it.

964
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:26,550
Input is temporarily disabled.

965
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:28,710
Don't say that.

966
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:30,230
Stop!

967
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:31,710
What are you doing?

968
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:32,350
Stop!

969
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:33,070
That's mine!

970
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:34,090
Oh my god.

971
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:34,450
Okay.

972
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:39,550
It's fine.

973
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,290
See, I was willing to put in the effort.

974
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:43,050
I'm still willing to put in the effort.

975
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:46,510
I put in the effort for this.

976
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,050
I put in the effort for this.

977
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:49,790
What were you doing?

978
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:50,670
You were sitting on your ass.

979
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:53,030
You're sitting on your ass again.

980
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:55,750
You're sitting on your ass again.

981
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:56,830
You're sitting on your ass again.

982
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:58,510
I work a 9 to 5 job.

983
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,710
And you're just sitting at home doing nothing.

984
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:02,370
I work a 9 to 5 job.

985
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:03,970
And you're just sitting at home doing nothing.

986
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:06,190
You don't even clean the house.

987
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:07,310
You don't even clean the house.

988
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:20,030
This is a perfectly healthy marriage.

989
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:26,730
You guys are getting scared.

990
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:28,870
Oh my god.

991
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:31,030
See, this is why you're here.

992
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:33,310
You're here to problem solve.

993
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:37,850
Oh my god, push the tree.

994
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:38,850
Push the tree.

995
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:41,170
See, there we go.

996
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:43,510
See, now you know how to do things.

997
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:53,090
Wait, oh this, right?

998
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:54,610
What do we do with this?

999
00:44:57,610 --> 00:45:00,090
Wait, what?

1000
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:06,130
We're doing it, guys.

1001
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:07,750
Look, see, we're working together.

1002
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:09,290
Therapy doesn't work in the end.

1003
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:11,190
We're gonna take marriage counseling.

1004
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:16,110
Oh, this is just appearance.

1005
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:20,850
Wait, I gotta tab out the game.

1006
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:26,210
Wait here.

1007
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:32,450
Wait here.

1008
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:36,770
Okay, there we go.

1009
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:46,030
Get out.

1010
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:52,110
You're a strong, independent woman.

1011
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:52,970
You don't need to do that.

1012
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:03,950
Are you okay?

1013
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:05,210
Are you okay?

1014
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:06,430
Go to the back.

1015
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:07,710
Hold jump.

1016
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:08,550
There we go.

1017
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:12,750
I felt like I had to.

1018
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:17,630
See,

1019
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:23,390
parkour is not that difficult.

1020
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:28,090
Why are you running away from me?

1021
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:30,810
Our therapist says we need to work on this together.

1022
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:37,790
This is your suggestion.

1023
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:39,490
You wanted therapy.

1024
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:41,730
You wanted couples counseling.

1025
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:45,790
I'm the one paying for it.

1026
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:50,110
Do your parkour again.

1027
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:51,390
Get out.

1028
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:00,530
Get out.

1029
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:03,770
Wait, I need to bring up my game volume.

1030
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:05,170
Stay still.

1031
00:47:05,810 --> 00:47:06,810
I need to bring it up.

1032
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:09,870
Okay, I brought it up.

1033
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:11,210
Okay, here we go.

1034
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:18,370
Does it work now?

1035
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:18,990
Does it?

1036
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:23,110
You could have been the one to host a remote play.

1037
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:24,270
That's all I'm saying.

1038
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:33,770
Here we go.

1039
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:34,850
See, we did it.

1040
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:35,670
We're doing it.

1041
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:39,110
We can fix our marriage.

1042
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:44,330
We can fix it.

1043
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:44,950
Gumi.

1044
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:49,190
Think about the happy memories we had.

1045
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:51,950
How did you climb?

1046
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:55,110
How did you do that?

1047
00:47:56,810 --> 00:47:57,490
How did you climb?

1048
00:47:58,090 --> 00:47:59,990
Gumi, you can't progress without me.

1049
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:01,210
How did you climb?

1050
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:03,050
Okay.

1051
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:05,390
I don't need your help, I guess.

1052
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:08,930
What the fuck is D?

1053
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:11,930
You have all the control inputs.

1054
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:12,850
I don't.

1055
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:14,590
Oh no.

1056
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:17,350
Oh my god.

1057
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:18,910
What is D on my controller?

1058
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:21,870
Okay, that's okay.

1059
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:25,050
Okay, I figured it out.

1060
00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:30,090
You have all the controls on your end.

1061
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:31,250
Like, I don't.

1062
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:34,310
It's all up to your controls just now.

1063
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:35,750
Alright.

1064
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:41,310
Okay, we can do this.

1065
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:42,550
We're not stupid.

1066
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:45,430
Come on, I'm pulling you.

1067
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:47,950
Come on, come on, come on.

1068
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:51,970
Yeah, see?

1069
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:54,470
Just like always.

1070
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:56,370
I do all the work.

1071
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:57,590
I hate men.

1072
00:48:58,890 --> 00:48:59,490
Wait, what?

1073
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:00,470
I'm Doki.

1074
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:04,870
What the fuck?

1075
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:07,110
You said that out of nowhere.

1076
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:08,390
That's fucked, bro.

1077
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:11,470
What did they do to you?

1078
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:15,490
That was so out of nowhere.

1079
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:21,310
So out of nowhere.

1080
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:24,810
You just triggered a trauma response.

1081
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:27,690
That's fucked, bro.

1082
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:30,670
Alright.

1083
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:32,710
I think...

1084
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:34,610
I think you're doing something to me.

1085
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:35,070
What?

1086
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:37,170
What am I doing?

1087
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:39,810
See, look at that.

1088
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:40,410
We're gaming.

1089
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:42,290
Look at that.

1090
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:44,570
Guys, counseling works.

1091
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:47,170
For me, I don't know about her for her, though.

1092
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,010
Like, I feel like a better person already.

1093
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:49,570
Like...

1094
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:56,870
Oh, by the way, Sound Guy.

1095
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:58,070
The game was brought up.

1096
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:05,790
You know, maybe we should, like, you know, remember the good times we had together.

1097
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:07,790
Like, bring back the spark, you know?

1098
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:09,670
Like, what made it work?

1099
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:12,210
What made it work?

1100
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:15,050
Remember the good times we had together playing Apex?

1101
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:16,170
Like, remember that?

1102
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:19,750
Remember all those good times he pulled me up?

1103
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:22,030
You remember that?

1104
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:26,490
Oh, she's gone.

1105
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:34,310
She's already gone.

1106
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:39,750
Parkour, look at that.

1107
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:41,730
Remember, like, how we first met?

1108
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:42,870
Jump for the chicken or for the beef?

1109
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:44,890
Of course I could jump for the beef.

1110
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:45,770
What?

1111
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:46,750
And make it, too.

1112
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:50,310
Do you know there's a Parkour Civilization Minecraft server?

1113
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:53,050
Yeah, I played a little bit of it.

1114
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:56,190
And I was, like, debating if I should do it as a stream thing.

1115
00:50:56,610 --> 00:50:59,090
But, like, okay, I'll do this.

1116
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:02,430
It's really I don't even think we can make it.

1117
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:04,430
I don't even think I can make it through the first level.

1118
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:06,810
So I decided not to.

1119
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:08,090
Alright, get over here.

1120
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:10,490
I'm pulling you.

1121
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:13,110
I'm pulling you.

1122
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:13,750
I'm pulling you.

1123
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:14,270
Alright.

1124
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:17,070
Alright, there you go.

1125
00:51:18,310 --> 00:51:20,970
Okay, that's on your end.

1126
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:22,430
I literally have fiber.

1127
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:23,690
I know it's on my end!

1128
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:26,530
Wait, I need to bring you up a little bit.

1129
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:29,430
Unless you want Gumi, stop, stop.

1130
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:30,190
I need to bring you up.

1131
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:32,850
Okay, unless you want me to Alright, here, you can move.

1132
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:35,350
Oh wait, sorry, I'm going to tab out real quick.

1133
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:37,890
There you go.

1134
00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:40,850
I warned you.

1135
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:46,030
I brought up the game a little bit.

1136
00:51:46,090 --> 00:51:46,710
Okay, here you go.

1137
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:48,510
Alright, you should be able to play now.

1138
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:50,250
I remember when we first met.

1139
00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:51,830
How did we first meet?

1140
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:52,570
I don't even remember.

1141
00:51:53,830 --> 00:51:54,910
You know, I remember.

1142
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:56,450
I brought it up to you recently.

1143
00:51:57,430 --> 00:51:58,010
You did?

1144
00:51:59,070 --> 00:52:01,830
I'm really forgetful and you know that.

1145
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:02,950
Hold on.

1146
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:04,690
What date did we first meet?

1147
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:06,770
What date?

1148
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:07,950
Yeah, what date?

1149
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:08,730
What's our anniversary?

1150
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:11,610
I remember our anniversary.

1151
00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:13,290
Okay, go ahead and tell me.

1152
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:14,930
No, because I want to know if you remember.

1153
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:18,270
You don't remember then.

1154
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:20,930
You don't remember our anniversary, that's so fun.

1155
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:21,870
It was June 22nd.

1156
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:24,090
You don't remember our anniversary.

1157
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:24,850
Yeah, what year?

1158
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:27,190
2019.

1159
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:30,630
Are you making up dates?

1160
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:35,090
Are you just making up the year?

1161
00:52:35,370 --> 00:52:36,330
You're making up the year.

1162
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:38,470
You made up the year.

1163
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:40,650
I messaged you through Twitter.

1164
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:41,590
You made it.

1165
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:42,680
You know what?

1166
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:45,690
I said, I don't know if this is weird, but you seem funny.

1167
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:46,450
I want to be friends.

1168
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:48,490
And you said, oh, that's so kind of you.

1169
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:49,650
Thank you for the host earlier.

1170
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:50,930
I love to be friends.

1171
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:52,970
That's not when we first meet.

1172
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:54,510
That was not when we first met.

1173
00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:56,070
That's when you first messaged me.

1174
00:52:56,070 --> 00:52:57,330
That's not when we first met.

1175
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:05,450
That's not when we first met.

1176
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:08,830
No, I want you to see if you remember.

1177
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:09,590
You don't remember.

1178
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:11,270
You literally don't even remember.

1179
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:13,290
I remember, but you don't remember.

1180
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:15,530
You don't even remember when we first met.

1181
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:20,110
You don't even remember when we first met.

1182
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:21,170
How did you get over there?

1183
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:22,510
Oh, you just went down.

1184
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:25,550
That's when you first messaged me.

1185
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:26,770
But that's not when we first met.

1186
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:41,550
All I'm saying is you don't even remember our anniversary.

1187
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:46,810
Here.

1188
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:48,890
Here, I pulled you up.

1189
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:53,270
Just like...

1190
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:54,150
All the other times.

1191
00:54:00,410 --> 00:54:02,590
Are you okay?

1192
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:05,690
Are you okay?

1193
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:16,450
I'm just revitalizing the passion.

1194
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:21,130
What are you trying to do?

1195
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:22,610
Here.

1196
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:25,670
What are we supposed to do with this?

1197
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:28,870
Are we stupid?

1198
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:33,290
You untied it.

1199
00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:35,130
Oh, I didn't.

1200
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:35,430
Here.

1201
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:37,210
What are we supposed to do?

1202
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:42,700
Like...

1203
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:44,060
What are we supposed to do with this?

1204
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:44,100
What are we supposed to do with this?

1205
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:50,280
Bridge can be tied between attach points?

1206
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:53,120
We're supposed to make a bridge?

1207
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,440
Maybe like...

1208
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,900
You tie over here.

1209
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,380
How did you make it that far?

1210
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,820
Oh, you did it.

1211
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:07,200
See?

1212
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:10,120
You're the brains in this relationship.

1213
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:18,090
Then what?

1214
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:21,270
Then what?

1215
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:22,950
Oh, you have to fling.

1216
00:55:26,210 --> 00:55:26,810
What?

1217
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:27,730
I have to what?

1218
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:29,250
You have to fling it.

1219
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:31,130
Wait.

1220
00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:34,190
What is he trying to make us do?

1221
00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:39,830
Oh!

1222
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:41,330
Wait, maybe?

1223
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:48,250
If I go all the way down here...

1224
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:49,110
That did nothing.

1225
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:52,970
This is where we have to think now.

1226
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:56,630
This is where we have to think.

1227
00:55:56,850 --> 00:55:58,290
This is where you have to think now.

1228
00:55:58,810 --> 00:55:59,130
What the?

1229
00:55:59,190 --> 00:55:59,830
Get off me!

1230
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:06,330
Why is everyone saying, Dookie, are you smart?

1231
00:56:06,490 --> 00:56:07,890
This is a group effort.

1232
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:10,410
She's clearly not smarter than a 5th grader.

1233
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:14,030
I saw you didn't know how to spell...

1234
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:16,110
How many R's are in extraterrestrial?

1235
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:16,750
Three.

1236
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:19,550
You have to think about it.

1237
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:20,490
You're thinking about it.

1238
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:22,410
You don't even know off the bat.

1239
00:56:22,970 --> 00:56:24,810
No, it's three.

1240
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:27,170
Extraterrestrial?

1241
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:28,010
Spell it.

1242
00:56:29,330 --> 00:56:35,430
E-X-T-R-A T-E-R-R E-S-T-R-I-A Oh, nice.

1243
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:35,830
You did it.

1244
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:36,270
You passed.

1245
00:56:36,330 --> 00:56:37,190
I was just testing you.

1246
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:39,050
I hate you!

1247
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:42,850
I was just testing you.

1248
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:44,650
Look at you.

1249
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:45,950
You actually spelled it.

1250
00:56:45,950 --> 00:56:58,710
You don't need a head!

1251
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:00,350
We don't need a head!

1252
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:01,750
We can do this!

1253
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:07,170
We don't need a head!

1254
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:07,430
We don't need a head!

1255
00:57:10,410 --> 00:57:11,190
I did it.

1256
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:11,710
I did it.

1257
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:12,370
I did it.

1258
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:13,890
You did nothing.

1259
00:57:14,590 --> 00:57:16,550
I was pressing the hands button and the thing went through.

1260
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:17,330
I did it.

1261
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:18,170
I fucking did it.

1262
00:57:18,190 --> 00:57:18,690
You're welcome.

1263
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:20,630
No, it's part of the tutorial.

1264
00:57:20,850 --> 00:57:22,650
No, I actually did it.

1265
00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:24,270
I actually did it.

1266
00:57:24,350 --> 00:57:24,930
I did something.

1267
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:26,890
You're welcome.

1268
00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:31,630
Is this how toxic marriage is?

1269
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:33,010
Look at this thing.

1270
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:36,950
This is a healthy relationship.

1271
00:57:42,210 --> 00:57:43,850
What are you trying to do?

1272
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:45,910
Oh, a bridge.

1273
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:51,390
And that's why you're not smarter than a fifth grader.

1274
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:52,490
You didn't read.

1275
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:52,870
I did.

1276
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:53,610
I helped you.

1277
00:57:53,690 --> 00:57:54,270
What do you mean?

1278
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:56,810
You didn't read Remote Play.

1279
00:57:57,210 --> 00:57:59,290
You didn't even...

1280
00:58:00,830 --> 00:58:01,270
I...

1281
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:03,470
I figured out Remote Play for you.

1282
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:05,210
I literally went out of...

1283
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:06,150
You watched a YouTube video.

1284
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:06,650
I did.

1285
00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:07,950
The YouTube video didn't even help.

1286
00:58:08,210 --> 00:58:08,910
What do you mean?

1287
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:10,270
The YouTube video didn't even help.

1288
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:11,650
The YouTube video doesn't even help.

1289
00:58:12,810 --> 00:58:14,750
Wait, how did you make that bridge?

1290
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:18,550
We did it.

1291
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:20,730
Like that.

1292
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:23,350
Oh my god, we're so smart.

1293
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:25,390
Here, I'll pull you up.

1294
00:58:28,490 --> 00:58:29,330
Get up.

1295
00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:30,890
Get up.

1296
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:33,690
I had to break my string first.

1297
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:34,330
Get up.

1298
00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:36,310
You're still tied up.

1299
00:58:36,970 --> 00:58:39,430
You're literally tied up to that one branch.

1300
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:40,170
There you go.

1301
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:43,550
You gotta let go of your possessions.

1302
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:47,050
Please.

1303
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:48,570
Jump.

1304
00:58:49,170 --> 00:58:50,570
Believe in us and jump.

1305
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:01,290
The yarn runs out too far apart.

1306
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:03,270
Hold S to...

1307
00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:04,590
God, I hope it runs out.

1308
00:59:05,290 --> 00:59:06,250
I hope.

1309
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:08,230
I hope it runs out.

1310
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:10,250
I hope so too.

1311
00:59:16,290 --> 00:59:18,330
I hope so too, brother.

1312
00:59:20,610 --> 00:59:22,610
And swing under the other...

1313
00:59:22,610 --> 00:59:24,770
Hold the yarn and swing under the other...

1314
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:26,830
Oh, I'm helping you swing.

1315
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:30,350
Gotta swing higher.

1316
00:59:37,770 --> 00:59:39,330
There you go.

1317
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:43,230
Okay, I'm here.

1318
00:59:44,970 --> 00:59:45,310
Alright.

1319
00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:47,610
What was our first collab game together?

1320
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:49,890
Overwatch.

1321
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:51,990
No, it was Apex.

1322
00:59:53,530 --> 00:59:55,050
No, it couldn't have been.

1323
00:59:55,090 --> 00:59:55,750
It was Apex.

1324
00:59:55,750 --> 00:59:57,110
Was it really?

1325
00:59:57,450 --> 00:59:58,230
Yeah, it was Apex.

1326
00:59:59,950 --> 01:00:00,470
See?

1327
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:01,770
You don't even remember.

1328
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:03,750
You don't...

1329
01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:11,690
You got the answer wrong, so we fall.

1330
01:00:13,270 --> 01:00:15,190
We messed through Overwatch.

1331
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:21,030
The first time we played together, it was in Apex.

1332
01:00:22,030 --> 01:00:26,510
What are you doing?

1333
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:28,230
Swing the other side!

1334
01:00:28,810 --> 01:00:29,910
I'm trying!

1335
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:33,860
Alright.

1336
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:35,640
Alright.

1337
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,060
Okay.

1338
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:40,640
There we go.

1339
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:42,720
That wasn't so difficult, was it?

1340
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:44,900
There, swing.

1341
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:46,420
No, your turn.

1342
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:47,560
Okay.

1343
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:47,720
Okay.

1344
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:02,920
You know, this just makes it so you have to spend longer time with me.

1345
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:03,880
You do know that, right?

1346
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:13,080
You know, like, the more you delay...

1347
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:14,980
The more you delay, the more...

1348
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:16,060
No, no, no!

1349
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,160
No, don't go up!

1350
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:18,960
It's slanted!

1351
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:20,920
It's slanted, you fucking whore!

1352
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:28,700
I

1353
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:33,270
did!

1354
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:37,990
I did!

1355
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:38,730
I just wanted...

1356
01:01:39,210 --> 01:01:40,110
I just want out.

1357
01:01:40,150 --> 01:01:40,630
Go.

1358
01:01:41,350 --> 01:01:44,130
If you want out, you gotta finish this game fast.

1359
01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:45,390
Yeah, and the longer...

1360
01:01:45,390 --> 01:01:47,510
We're not ending the stream until we finish it.

1361
01:01:47,550 --> 01:01:48,610
You remember that, right?

1362
01:01:50,030 --> 01:01:50,550
Go.

1363
01:01:52,890 --> 01:01:53,610
Alright, fine.

1364
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:55,370
Fine, fine.

1365
01:01:55,430 --> 01:01:56,250
We can be here.

1366
01:01:56,430 --> 01:01:57,530
Don't you have a collab after this?

1367
01:01:57,590 --> 01:01:58,970
Don't you have a fucking Mario Kart collab?

1368
01:01:59,290 --> 01:02:00,430
Well, guess you gotta cancel that.

1369
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:02,830
Go message him right now and say you're canceling it.

1370
01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:02,950
Go.

1371
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:07,450
It's okay, he didn't even wake up until 10pm last night.

1372
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:11,690
Oh my god, fucking grip the yard!

1373
01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:16,050
Alright.

1374
01:02:16,990 --> 01:02:18,910
Because I am the adult here.

1375
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:19,970
I shall.

1376
01:02:19,970 --> 01:02:22,410
I'll do this for us.

1377
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:29,150
Oh my god, I fucking hate you sometimes.

1378
01:02:33,810 --> 01:02:35,050
You know what you did.

1379
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:38,690
Okay, do not jump over.

1380
01:02:39,010 --> 01:02:40,210
Do not jump over.

1381
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:42,790
Now you can.

1382
01:02:43,470 --> 01:02:44,850
Now you can jump over.

1383
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:47,390
Now you can jump over.

1384
01:02:47,390 --> 01:02:47,790
Okay.

1385
01:02:49,510 --> 01:02:50,310
Just climb.

1386
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:51,190
Just climb.

1387
01:02:52,890 --> 01:02:55,590
See, we don't need to pay for therapy.

1388
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:57,650
We can just play video games and solve our issues.

1389
01:02:59,230 --> 01:03:00,390
What was your plan?

1390
01:03:01,330 --> 01:03:02,390
I was going to jump.

1391
01:03:02,550 --> 01:03:03,290
What was your plan?

1392
01:03:05,350 --> 01:03:07,630
What did you have in your little head there?

1393
01:03:07,630 --> 01:03:08,490
I wanted to jump.

1394
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:12,630
Okay, then you do it.

1395
01:03:12,790 --> 01:03:15,690
No, no, no.

1396
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:16,770
Okay, fine, fine, fine.

1397
01:03:17,490 --> 01:03:17,970
Go.

1398
01:03:19,150 --> 01:03:19,930
What was your plan?

1399
01:03:20,650 --> 01:03:21,150
Do this.

1400
01:03:22,550 --> 01:03:24,050
Why couldn't you do that?

1401
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:26,830
Why couldn't you do that, huh?

1402
01:03:27,950 --> 01:03:29,790
Why couldn't you do that, huh?

1403
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:35,340
What are you doing?

1404
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:36,760
What are you doing?

1405
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:39,340
I'm waiting.

1406
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:41,120
No, you do it.

1407
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:42,160
You're so smart.

1408
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:43,460
No, you're so smart.

1409
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:45,720
No, you're so smart.

1410
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:46,960
You can do it.

1411
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:52,810
Jump the other way.

1412
01:03:53,110 --> 01:03:54,090
No, I'm not going to jump.

1413
01:03:55,070 --> 01:03:55,950
I'm not going to do it.

1414
01:03:56,590 --> 01:03:58,010
I'm my own independent person.

1415
01:03:59,550 --> 01:04:01,430
I'm not going to let you be in control anymore.

1416
01:04:02,210 --> 01:04:02,870
Get out.

1417
01:04:03,910 --> 01:04:04,970
The house is in my name.

1418
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:28,340
Go, go.

1419
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:29,040
Go do your thing.

1420
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:29,840
Come on, go.

1421
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,200
You said you would do it.

1422
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:33,360
No, no, no.

1423
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:34,940
You clearly know more than me.

1424
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:38,100
You clearly know more.

1425
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:38,920
Do it.

1426
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:42,380
What?

1427
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:46,240
What?

1428
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:48,700
Oh, wow.

1429
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:53,440
As if somebody here is actually willing to try here in this relationship.

1430
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:54,400
Wow.

1431
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:54,520
Wow.

1432
01:04:57,540 --> 01:04:58,700
Is that crazy?

1433
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,360
At least one of us is trying.

1434
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:03,840
That's freaking insane.

1435
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:10,060
I think you should be studied in a lab.

1436
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:11,560
I think you should be studied in a lab.

1437
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:14,860
You're the one that's pro-lying the fucking game.

1438
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,420
Go down, go down.

1439
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:17,160
I think you should be studied in a lab.

1440
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:29,460
Are you okay?

1441
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:30,960
Are you okay?

1442
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:37,300
You can adjust the yard however you like.

1443
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:43,300
Would me going higher help you?

1444
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:45,160
Well, clearly it doesn't.

1445
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:45,740
Clearly.

1446
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:53,440
Just stay right there!

1447
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:55,600
I don't trust you anymore.

1448
01:05:57,820 --> 01:05:58,860
Are you okay?

1449
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:00,260
No, no, no.

1450
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:00,840
It's fine.

1451
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:02,680
You want to be independent?

1452
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:03,320
That's fine.

1453
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:06,000
I never said all that.

1454
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:09,480
Alright.

1455
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:12,860
Whoa.

1456
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:13,660
Whoa.

1457
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:17,240
Wouldn't it be funny if I do this first try?

1458
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:20,720
Wouldn't that be funny?

1459
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:21,880
That's not the try yet.

1460
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:23,140
That wasn't the try yet.

1461
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,200
That wasn't the try yet.

1462
01:06:28,950 --> 01:06:29,830
How was that?

1463
01:06:30,310 --> 01:06:30,870
Oh, wow.

1464
01:06:30,890 --> 01:06:31,510
How was that?

1465
01:06:32,910 --> 01:06:33,910
You know what?

1466
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,090
Why don't you try it too?

1467
01:06:35,290 --> 01:06:37,570
Why don't you try it?

1468
01:06:37,710 --> 01:06:39,370
I want to know how you do it.

1469
01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:41,430
Why don't you try it as well?

1470
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:42,350
Why don't...

1471
01:06:43,850 --> 01:06:44,930
Come on, get over here.

1472
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:47,630
Why don't you figure out and see how that goes?

1473
01:06:47,830 --> 01:06:48,930
Why don't you try that?

1474
01:06:52,810 --> 01:06:53,790
No, no, no.

1475
01:06:53,870 --> 01:06:55,310
I want to know how you're going to do it.

1476
01:07:01,290 --> 01:07:01,610
Alright.

1477
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:06,630
You got to learn how to do this too.

1478
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:08,090
You want to be independent?

1479
01:07:08,270 --> 01:07:09,230
You got to learn how to do it.

1480
01:07:09,230 --> 01:07:09,770
Come on.

1481
01:07:10,010 --> 01:07:10,430
Go.

1482
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:20,730
Oh, yeah.

1483
01:07:20,890 --> 01:07:21,290
Come on.

1484
01:07:21,330 --> 01:07:22,130
You can do it.

1485
01:07:34,910 --> 01:07:36,070
You'll figure this out.

1486
01:07:36,310 --> 01:07:37,470
You'll figure this out.

1487
01:07:38,670 --> 01:07:40,870
I have too many tears in my eyes.

1488
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:41,870
I can't see.

1489
01:07:48,070 --> 01:07:49,770
You'll figure it out.

1490
01:07:49,910 --> 01:07:50,410
Come on.

1491
01:07:50,550 --> 01:07:51,630
Oh, look.

1492
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:52,590
You did it.

1493
01:07:52,710 --> 01:07:55,010
It wasn't that difficult, was it?

1494
01:07:55,330 --> 01:07:58,550
It wasn't so difficult, was it, Gumi?

1495
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:00,950
Here we go.

1496
01:08:01,030 --> 01:08:01,810
We did it.

1497
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:06,310
See, Gumi?

1498
01:08:06,710 --> 01:08:08,130
It wasn't so hard.

1499
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:10,530
Now you're more independent than ever.

1500
01:08:12,370 --> 01:08:13,070
Come on.

1501
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:14,150
Get over here.

1502
01:08:15,610 --> 01:08:16,930
You can't pull me out.

1503
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:18,570
I'm already in the next scene, JK.

1504
01:08:22,310 --> 01:08:23,310
Look at that.

1505
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:26,410
Guys, this is why we're so good together.

1506
01:08:26,410 --> 01:08:26,470
Okay.

1507
01:08:36,790 --> 01:08:38,030
You're also attached?

1508
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:38,410
Oh, wait.

1509
01:08:38,450 --> 01:08:38,710
No.

1510
01:08:39,530 --> 01:08:40,670
We can slow time?

1511
01:08:40,810 --> 01:08:41,690
How do we slow time?

1512
01:08:42,670 --> 01:08:43,850
Are you slowing time yet?

1513
01:08:46,450 --> 01:08:48,110
Are you slowing time right now?

1514
01:08:50,170 --> 01:08:51,610
How do we slow time?

1515
01:08:56,410 --> 01:08:57,010
Do you slow time?

1516
01:08:57,090 --> 01:08:58,090
Because it's not on my screen.

1517
01:08:58,370 --> 01:08:59,290
I don't know.

1518
01:08:59,850 --> 01:09:01,150
It says press L.

1519
01:09:01,390 --> 01:09:02,750
I pressed L.

1520
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:06,190
It says turn off slo-mo.

1521
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:09,170
I don't see the slo-mo on my end.

1522
01:09:09,910 --> 01:09:11,350
I don't see it either.

1523
01:09:13,630 --> 01:09:15,210
Are we stupid?

1524
01:09:18,750 --> 01:09:20,890
I don't even need slo-mo.

1525
01:09:22,690 --> 01:09:24,010
I don't need slo-mo.

1526
01:09:24,010 --> 01:09:25,110
You can do this by yourself.

1527
01:09:25,210 --> 01:09:25,910
You know that, right?

1528
01:09:27,710 --> 01:09:28,430
There we go.

1529
01:09:31,370 --> 01:09:33,350
Wait, you guys see the slo-mo?

1530
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:35,970
Oh, no.

1531
01:09:36,010 --> 01:09:36,830
You're saying I'm stupid.

1532
01:09:37,030 --> 01:09:37,190
Okay.

1533
01:09:41,450 --> 01:09:42,790
Wait, how do we do this?

1534
01:09:44,810 --> 01:09:46,270
Monkey see, monkey do.

1535
01:09:46,270 --> 01:09:47,410
Right, Goomy?

1536
01:09:50,650 --> 01:09:51,570
Why not?

1537
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:52,830
Why don't you like monkeys?

1538
01:09:53,070 --> 01:09:55,250
What has monkeys- No, they're not.

1539
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:57,590
They're just a little guy.

1540
01:09:59,130 --> 01:10:00,090
I hope you burn in there.

1541
01:10:01,610 --> 01:10:01,990
Yay.

1542
01:10:07,130 --> 01:10:08,620
We did it.

1543
01:10:10,270 --> 01:10:10,890
See?

1544
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:15,250
I think we're really good together.

1545
01:10:15,930 --> 01:10:17,190
You should never leave.

1546
01:10:21,530 --> 01:10:22,590
Don't say that.

1547
01:10:22,610 --> 01:10:23,350
Don't say that.

1548
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:31,790
Look.

1549
01:10:33,590 --> 01:10:35,310
I think that was just a tutorial.

1550
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:37,370
Was that just a tutorial?

1551
01:10:38,390 --> 01:10:39,930
Guys, did we just...

1552
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:44,530
We finished chapter one.

1553
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:46,070
Wait, how many chapters are there?

1554
01:10:51,340 --> 01:10:53,280
Wait, how many chapters are there, chat?

1555
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:58,820
I'm starting to get a bit concerned.

1556
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:02,540
Of what?

1557
01:11:02,620 --> 01:11:03,840
Of how great our love is?

1558
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:08,580
There's 11 chapters.

1559
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:13,420
Oh, there's Bird.

1560
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:15,420
Wait, what happened to the little- That's me.

1561
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:16,920
That's me.

1562
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:22,240
Okay, you're definitely not the big raven.

1563
01:11:22,340 --> 01:11:23,300
You're not even in the picture.

1564
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:27,360
That's me before I met my love.

1565
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,140
I'm gonna shit.

1566
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:31,320
What?

1567
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,120
Wait, what do we do?

1568
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,620
I think we're supposed to head here.

1569
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:37,100
Yeah, see?

1570
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:40,640
Why can't I look around?

1571
01:11:40,780 --> 01:11:41,840
Why am I not allowed to look around?

1572
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:42,560
There's seven chapters.

1573
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:44,540
Thank God.

1574
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:49,460
Guys, I love my wife, but like...

1575
01:11:51,940 --> 01:12:01,480
You know, every time I play co-op games with you, I have fun, but then I also remember I never want to play if I'm dating someone and I'm actually like dating them.

1576
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:03,020
Because I feel like I would mald.

1577
01:12:03,340 --> 01:12:05,320
I feel like you've trained me to mald.

1578
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:10,700
But that makes it more exciting.

1579
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:15,360
Whoa!

1580
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:15,860
Whoa!

1581
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:18,160
That's a child.

1582
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:19,820
Ah!

1583
01:12:26,890 --> 01:12:28,110
Wait, what's going on?

1584
01:12:29,210 --> 01:12:30,390
Wait, that's us.

1585
01:12:30,950 --> 01:12:31,950
No, that's not.

1586
01:12:32,030 --> 01:12:32,670
That's a child.

1587
01:12:32,930 --> 01:12:33,830
We're yarn people.

1588
01:12:36,210 --> 01:12:37,210
That's our kid.

1589
01:12:39,610 --> 01:12:40,670
That's our kid?

1590
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:43,390
Look, this is what happens when we argue with each other.

1591
01:12:43,470 --> 01:12:44,130
Look what you did.

1592
01:12:44,910 --> 01:12:45,510
I've done nothing.

1593
01:12:46,110 --> 01:12:47,330
I've literally done nothing.

1594
01:12:47,450 --> 01:12:48,350
Look, look.

1595
01:12:48,350 --> 01:12:49,050
Look, look.

1596
01:12:49,390 --> 01:12:52,270
Oh my god, now she's closing the door against us.

1597
01:12:52,350 --> 01:12:52,910
Look at that.

1598
01:12:52,930 --> 01:12:54,290
She's closing the door against you.

1599
01:12:54,410 --> 01:12:55,550
She hates you.

1600
01:12:56,050 --> 01:12:57,370
Why is that me?

1601
01:12:57,830 --> 01:12:58,790
You're the wife?

1602
01:12:58,930 --> 01:13:00,590
That's the wife right there.

1603
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:02,410
That's just a man with a man bun.

1604
01:13:02,830 --> 01:13:03,830
That's a woman.

1605
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:04,710
What do you mean?

1606
01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:06,270
You would have a man bun.

1607
01:13:07,270 --> 01:13:08,430
Of course, I'm the husband.

1608
01:13:10,650 --> 01:13:11,410
Look, look, look.

1609
01:13:11,670 --> 01:13:13,350
Oh, we were not supposed to...

1610
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:14,130
Oh, sorry.

1611
01:13:14,310 --> 01:13:15,730
I was too busy looking at this.

1612
01:13:17,190 --> 01:13:20,090
Where are we supposed to...

1613
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:21,710
What's that?

1614
01:13:22,550 --> 01:13:23,770
I don't want to push this.

1615
01:13:24,130 --> 01:13:25,490
Oh, you're supposed to be on this side?

1616
01:13:25,570 --> 01:13:26,790
I'm supposed to be on that side.

1617
01:13:31,010 --> 01:13:32,650
That child is strong.

1618
01:13:33,590 --> 01:13:35,190
That's a strong child right there.

1619
01:13:40,530 --> 01:13:41,270
You know what?

1620
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:43,090
I'm going to tab out real quick.

1621
01:13:43,270 --> 01:13:44,450
I'm going to move you closer to me.

1622
01:13:44,790 --> 01:13:45,630
On my screen.

1623
01:13:52,570 --> 01:13:53,870
Give me a sec.

1624
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:54,910
I'm going to move you closer.

1625
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:55,930
I'm moving you closer.

1626
01:13:56,090 --> 01:13:56,710
Give me a sec.

1627
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:00,270
Oh, I can't.

1628
01:14:00,390 --> 01:14:02,870
I can't because my OBS preview is dead.

1629
01:14:05,230 --> 01:14:06,110
I forgot.

1630
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:08,070
I forgot I like...

1631
01:14:08,070 --> 01:14:10,290
My OBS preview died.

1632
01:14:10,790 --> 01:14:12,550
So I can't move you closer.

1633
01:14:13,210 --> 01:14:13,390
Alright.

1634
01:14:14,830 --> 01:14:15,350
I'm sorry.

1635
01:14:16,550 --> 01:14:17,570
I'm going to push this box.

1636
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:22,190
Does it go faster?

1637
01:14:22,690 --> 01:14:23,430
No, it doesn't.

1638
01:14:23,490 --> 01:14:24,050
So it doesn't matter.

1639
01:14:27,310 --> 01:14:28,570
Oh, she jumped out the...

1640
01:14:28,570 --> 01:14:30,070
Whoa, where did she go?

1641
01:14:30,650 --> 01:14:32,070
She's trying to run away.

1642
01:14:32,850 --> 01:14:34,630
But you know how to do the bridge.

1643
01:14:34,730 --> 01:14:35,190
I don't.

1644
01:14:36,870 --> 01:14:37,950
How did you do that?

1645
01:14:38,690 --> 01:14:39,870
How did you tie the knot?

1646
01:14:40,330 --> 01:14:41,170
You got to teach me.

1647
01:14:42,070 --> 01:14:43,970
How am I supposed to teach you when you're playing controller?

1648
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:45,250
I don't know.

1649
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:45,890
That's...

1650
01:14:45,890 --> 01:14:47,550
You're supposed to be...

1651
01:14:51,250 --> 01:14:52,770
Ask politely.

1652
01:14:52,950 --> 01:14:53,490
Ask nicely.

1653
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:55,490
I'll jump off right now.

1654
01:14:58,970 --> 01:15:00,550
You got to ask nicely.

1655
01:15:04,210 --> 01:15:04,970
Okay.

1656
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:07,850
Hold on.

1657
01:15:08,130 --> 01:15:08,730
Stay here.

1658
01:15:10,490 --> 01:15:11,530
That's right.

1659
01:15:11,530 --> 01:15:12,630
There we go.

1660
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:15,010
And then, here you go.

1661
01:15:15,490 --> 01:15:17,550
And that's how you work together.

1662
01:15:22,730 --> 01:15:23,210
Sometimes...

1663
01:15:23,210 --> 01:15:24,530
You make me like...

1664
01:15:25,870 --> 01:15:27,470
Genuinely manually like...

1665
01:15:27,470 --> 01:15:28,950
What did I do?

1666
01:15:29,790 --> 01:15:30,190
Get over here.

1667
01:15:30,270 --> 01:15:30,550
Get over here.

1668
01:15:30,570 --> 01:15:30,890
Let go.

1669
01:15:31,090 --> 01:15:31,450
Let go.

1670
01:15:31,710 --> 01:15:32,170
Let go.

1671
01:15:33,410 --> 01:15:34,370
I'm fine.

1672
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:36,310
Live here.

1673
01:15:37,250 --> 01:15:37,990
I'm leaving.

1674
01:15:41,930 --> 01:15:43,410
Oh, oh, oh, yeah?

1675
01:15:43,790 --> 01:15:44,210
Yeah.

1676
01:15:44,590 --> 01:15:45,970
Oh, man.

1677
01:15:46,710 --> 01:15:47,270
Okay.

1678
01:15:53,330 --> 01:15:56,010
I feel like I'm starting to breathe through my mouth.

1679
01:15:57,710 --> 01:15:59,550
What do you mean by that?

1680
01:15:59,630 --> 01:16:00,270
I don't understand.

1681
01:16:02,570 --> 01:16:03,090
See?

1682
01:16:03,450 --> 01:16:04,450
It's that easy.

1683
01:16:05,730 --> 01:16:06,110
Oh.

1684
01:16:06,570 --> 01:16:09,070
Well, one of us was supposed to stay there.

1685
01:16:09,070 --> 01:16:11,110
Well, I jumped first.

1686
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:12,930
No, I jumped first on my screen.

1687
01:16:13,030 --> 01:16:13,810
I was first.

1688
01:16:15,390 --> 01:16:17,550
But because I'm the adult here...

1689
01:16:17,550 --> 01:16:18,610
Go, go, go.

1690
01:16:18,790 --> 01:16:18,890
Go.

1691
01:16:20,730 --> 01:16:21,290
See?

1692
01:16:22,930 --> 01:16:23,490
Oh.

1693
01:16:24,010 --> 01:16:24,870
Look at that.

1694
01:16:26,050 --> 01:16:28,090
This is how you can be a mature adult.

1695
01:16:28,690 --> 01:16:29,370
And compromise.

1696
01:16:31,870 --> 01:16:32,430
Yeah?

1697
01:16:32,430 --> 01:16:32,470
Yeah?

1698
01:16:36,610 --> 01:16:38,950
This is not gaslighting, chat.

1699
01:16:39,710 --> 01:16:40,650
I'm just...

1700
01:16:40,650 --> 01:16:42,870
I'm just trying to say therapy works.

1701
01:16:46,990 --> 01:16:48,210
Okay, here.

1702
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:49,250
You know what?

1703
01:16:52,690 --> 01:16:54,410
Why did you send me to my dad?

1704
01:16:56,710 --> 01:16:57,930
What are you talking about?

1705
01:17:03,730 --> 01:17:05,750
I would never do such a thing.

1706
01:17:05,930 --> 01:17:07,790
I fucking knew it.

1707
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:09,170
I knew it.

1708
01:17:14,170 --> 01:17:16,050
I fucking knew it.

1709
01:17:16,130 --> 01:17:17,110
I knew you would.

1710
01:17:17,410 --> 01:17:19,250
I knew it.

1711
01:17:19,330 --> 01:17:21,950
What happened to trust?

1712
01:17:22,810 --> 01:17:23,810
You're so stupid.

1713
01:17:23,970 --> 01:17:24,930
You're so...

1714
01:17:28,030 --> 01:17:30,550
You're so stupid.

1715
01:17:30,550 --> 01:17:32,090
I literally have prep time.

1716
01:17:32,090 --> 01:17:34,610
I literally have prep time.

1717
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:35,570
Oh, yeah?

1718
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:37,690
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1719
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:40,450
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1720
01:17:41,150 --> 01:17:41,870
Yeah, yeah.

1721
01:17:41,930 --> 01:17:42,930
You want to keep doing that?

1722
01:17:44,210 --> 01:17:46,290
Cancel your Mario Kart collab right now.

1723
01:17:46,410 --> 01:17:47,890
You want to keep doing...

1724
01:17:50,990 --> 01:17:53,730
Yeah, look how you cancel four times on me.

1725
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:57,150
You're such a bitch.

1726
01:17:57,150 --> 01:17:58,930
You're such a bitch.

1727
01:18:12,150 --> 01:18:12,750
Alright.

1728
01:18:16,590 --> 01:18:17,190
Nice.

1729
01:18:17,770 --> 01:18:19,330
See, that's not so difficult.

1730
01:18:20,150 --> 01:18:20,870
Wait, we should...

1731
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:22,050
There's a secret here.

1732
01:18:22,930 --> 01:18:23,950
How do we get over there?

1733
01:18:24,670 --> 01:18:26,350
We don't need a secret, fuck it.

1734
01:18:27,430 --> 01:18:27,730
Alright.

1735
01:18:29,010 --> 01:18:30,130
Yeah, fuck it.

1736
01:18:30,190 --> 01:18:32,510
We're not here to complete the game.

1737
01:18:32,850 --> 01:18:34,130
We're not here to be completionists.

1738
01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:36,890
We just want to make sure we pass therapy.

1739
01:18:40,130 --> 01:18:41,510
Move the box.

1740
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:41,950
Oh!

1741
01:18:43,730 --> 01:18:45,610
We ran away with another kid.

1742
01:18:46,550 --> 01:18:47,610
Oh my god.

1743
01:18:49,190 --> 01:18:49,850
Who's he?

1744
01:18:50,110 --> 01:18:50,850
Who's this child?

1745
01:18:53,990 --> 01:18:55,310
I don't know, but there's men.

1746
01:18:55,310 --> 01:18:57,690
And I don't like them.

1747
01:18:57,890 --> 01:18:59,310
Yes, you do.

1748
01:19:04,270 --> 01:19:05,030
What?

1749
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:13,040
Alright.

1750
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:14,440
What's that?

1751
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:15,500
That's fire.

1752
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:17,260
Don't touch the fire.

1753
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:19,740
You know what happens when you touch the fire?

1754
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:23,820
Whoa.

1755
01:19:23,820 --> 01:19:23,880
Whoa.

1756
01:19:27,140 --> 01:19:29,060
That's what happens when you touch the fire.

1757
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:32,040
What?

1758
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:33,840
Oh, you're so good at this?

1759
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:34,180
Okay.

1760
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:36,580
It's just easier.

1761
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:41,680
Okay.

1762
01:19:50,290 --> 01:19:51,990
Oh my god, we're so cold.

1763
01:19:52,950 --> 01:19:53,950
What the heck?

1764
01:19:53,950 --> 01:19:55,630
He's not gonna kill us.

1765
01:20:00,850 --> 01:20:02,310
What if I die to it?

1766
01:20:02,390 --> 01:20:04,090
You don't even think about me.

1767
01:20:04,930 --> 01:20:07,290
You just left without thinking about me.

1768
01:20:07,790 --> 01:20:08,550
I thought you were an adult.

1769
01:20:08,850 --> 01:20:12,090
I am, but I just wanted to see if you love me.

1770
01:20:14,570 --> 01:20:16,750
The answer varies on a day-to-day basis.

1771
01:20:18,790 --> 01:20:19,230
Come on.

1772
01:20:20,710 --> 01:20:21,190
Yeah?

1773
01:20:33,940 --> 01:20:34,400
What?

1774
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:47,720
We don't need to...

1775
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:49,040
We can do this as one person.

1776
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:52,860
Okay.

1777
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:55,040
You made it last time, we can do it again.

1778
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:58,300
You're the one that's supposed to move.

1779
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:00,820
No, you can move.

1780
01:21:00,820 --> 01:21:02,640
No, I can't.

1781
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:04,780
Okay, let me fix that.

1782
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:06,500
Okay, let me fix that too.

1783
01:21:06,940 --> 01:21:08,000
Let me fix that.

1784
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:13,560
Oh wow, that's too bad.

1785
01:21:25,670 --> 01:21:26,550
Where are you going?

1786
01:21:26,670 --> 01:21:27,190
Come on.

1787
01:21:27,370 --> 01:21:28,870
Don't you want to finish this game?

1788
01:21:30,530 --> 01:21:31,190
Come on.

1789
01:21:31,270 --> 01:21:31,870
What are you doing?

1790
01:21:32,270 --> 01:21:34,790
Somebody here is stalling.

1791
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:48,960
Here we go.

1792
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:49,480
See?

1793
01:21:49,820 --> 01:21:51,200
We're so good together.

1794
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:53,260
Here, I'll hold.

1795
01:21:54,220 --> 01:21:55,200
Oh, you're gonna hold?

1796
01:21:56,020 --> 01:21:57,060
I don't trust you.

1797
01:21:57,100 --> 01:21:57,280
Go.

1798
01:21:58,360 --> 01:21:59,040
Okay, fine.

1799
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:00,920
Yeah, this is why I don't trust you.

1800
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:06,600
Get closer to the- Oh my god.

1801
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:10,140
What are you doing?

1802
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:12,920
What are you- Oh my god.

1803
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:17,420
What are you- What are you doing?

1804
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:18,260
What are you doing?

1805
01:22:22,820 --> 01:22:23,320
Jump.

1806
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:36,420
Jump.

1807
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:37,120
Pull the string.

1808
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:38,860
Pull the string.

1809
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:41,840
I see you not pulling the string.

1810
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:44,620
I see you not...

1811
01:22:44,620 --> 01:22:46,200
Pull the string.

1812
01:22:48,620 --> 01:22:49,680
See, guys?

1813
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:51,600
Now you know who's the actual problem.

1814
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:51,780
Now you know who's the actual problem.

1815
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:03,960
What are you supposed to do here?

1816
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:05,180
You stay right here.

1817
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:06,180
Okay.

1818
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:08,840
And then I do this.

1819
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:09,640
Oh, okay.

1820
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:11,500
And then what?

1821
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:13,360
Can I push this back over?

1822
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:17,340
Oh, okay.

1823
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:18,340
Then what?

1824
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:20,700
Okay, stop pushing it.

1825
01:23:24,610 --> 01:23:25,110
Oh!

1826
01:23:25,710 --> 01:23:27,050
God, I'm so smart.

1827
01:23:29,650 --> 01:23:31,150
I hate men.

1828
01:23:31,550 --> 01:23:32,750
Wait, I'm jokey.

1829
01:23:35,590 --> 01:23:37,550
I think you're supposed to get all the way up there.

1830
01:23:38,430 --> 01:23:39,470
Yeah, I think so too.

1831
01:23:40,330 --> 01:23:41,370
God, I'm so smart.

1832
01:23:46,330 --> 01:23:46,830
Alright.

1833
01:23:48,510 --> 01:23:49,410
What do we do here?

1834
01:23:53,650 --> 01:23:54,910
That's a trick question.

1835
01:23:55,370 --> 01:23:56,590
I know what to do here.

1836
01:23:56,590 --> 01:23:57,970
I know what to do here.

1837
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:03,130
I like how you were actually thinking it was a puzzle.

1838
01:24:04,670 --> 01:24:07,430
I hate men and joking.

1839
01:24:09,710 --> 01:24:11,130
Let's go, men.

1840
01:24:11,710 --> 01:24:12,370
Let's go.

1841
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:24,240
Oh, it's so cute.

1842
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:25,440
Why aren't they killing us?

1843
01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:29,140
I feel like they...

1844
01:24:29,140 --> 01:24:29,960
I got squirted on.

1845
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:31,900
Gumi?

1846
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:38,740
That's what you did.

1847
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:40,280
I was just showing what you did.

1848
01:24:47,770 --> 01:24:48,610
Can we...

1849
01:24:48,610 --> 01:24:51,070
Oh no, there's the kids.

1850
01:24:51,650 --> 01:24:52,030
Cat!

1851
01:24:52,710 --> 01:24:53,670
Wait, I think that's us!

1852
01:24:54,190 --> 01:24:56,530
One's wearing a yellow shirt, one's wearing a purple shirt.

1853
01:24:57,890 --> 01:24:59,010
I'm the little boy!

1854
01:24:59,730 --> 01:25:01,050
I'm the little boy!

1855
01:25:01,050 --> 01:25:03,570
I don't think they customized it like that, I'll be honest.

1856
01:25:03,730 --> 01:25:04,510
I think they did.

1857
01:25:04,650 --> 01:25:05,670
Why are they wearing our colors?

1858
01:25:06,890 --> 01:25:08,010
I think that's us.

1859
01:25:10,950 --> 01:25:12,530
Okay, now you've tangled up the yarn.

1860
01:25:12,610 --> 01:25:13,310
I hope you're happy.

1861
01:25:13,610 --> 01:25:15,490
I hope you're happy.

1862
01:25:15,650 --> 01:25:16,510
You've tangled up the yarn.

1863
01:25:16,650 --> 01:25:20,530
Go back and untangle the yarn.

1864
01:25:21,090 --> 01:25:22,350
Go back and...

1865
01:25:22,350 --> 01:25:23,850
Oh my god, okay.

1866
01:25:24,770 --> 01:25:25,230
We're fine.

1867
01:25:26,650 --> 01:25:27,950
We'll have it your way.

1868
01:25:27,950 --> 01:25:29,910
Because I am willing to compromise.

1869
01:25:36,010 --> 01:25:37,630
Okay, fine, fine, fine.

1870
01:25:37,810 --> 01:25:39,630
I'm willing to compromise again.

1871
01:25:45,890 --> 01:25:47,170
That's fine, that's fine.

1872
01:25:48,070 --> 01:25:50,010
I'm willing to compromise for us.

1873
01:25:50,310 --> 01:25:51,890
I'm willing to make sacrifices.

1874
01:25:52,470 --> 01:25:53,750
What sacrifice have you made?

1875
01:25:53,750 --> 01:25:53,790
My brain.

1876
01:25:54,850 --> 01:25:57,650
My brain cells talking to you.

1877
01:25:57,850 --> 01:26:00,470
Every day, every day I talk to you.

1878
01:26:00,530 --> 01:26:02,310
I sacrifice a little piece of me.

1879
01:26:02,690 --> 01:26:03,750
But you still come back.

1880
01:26:04,530 --> 01:26:05,830
It's an abusive relationship.

1881
01:26:12,430 --> 01:26:14,150
This is love.

1882
01:26:14,850 --> 01:26:15,570
Through and through.

1883
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:17,730
Skateboard.

1884
01:26:20,950 --> 01:26:22,810
Okay, you gotta push it.

1885
01:26:28,110 --> 01:26:29,890
You wanna kiss?

1886
01:26:30,950 --> 01:26:32,370
No, get away from me.

1887
01:26:34,150 --> 01:26:36,750
We gotta reunite the spark.

1888
01:26:39,790 --> 01:26:41,990
Sometimes the spark is just gone.

1889
01:26:42,110 --> 01:26:43,010
We ran out of fuel.

1890
01:26:43,010 --> 01:26:44,170
What do you mean?

1891
01:26:45,030 --> 01:26:47,210
What do you mean we're enjoying this?

1892
01:26:48,790 --> 01:26:49,930
That's us.

1893
01:26:58,490 --> 01:27:01,870
We did it together as we should.

1894
01:27:04,290 --> 01:27:07,990
Wait, why are you doing that?

1895
01:27:10,030 --> 01:27:10,430
Do we?

1896
01:27:11,590 --> 01:27:12,430
Do we?

1897
01:27:15,290 --> 01:27:16,110
I don't know.

1898
01:27:18,490 --> 01:27:19,330
I am.

1899
01:27:20,350 --> 01:27:21,670
Why would we need to bring that bucket?

1900
01:27:24,770 --> 01:27:26,110
Oh, maybe we do.

1901
01:27:26,350 --> 01:27:27,470
Wait, yeah, yeah, it's a ramp.

1902
01:27:28,230 --> 01:27:29,270
Wait, have you played this game before?

1903
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:35,770
Did you not make it?

1904
01:27:40,430 --> 01:27:41,050
We come out.

1905
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:43,130
Let me break it.

1906
01:27:46,330 --> 01:27:47,330
There's one here.

1907
01:27:49,770 --> 01:27:51,430
I still don't know how to tie knots.

1908
01:27:53,010 --> 01:27:53,670
It's okay.

1909
01:27:54,390 --> 01:27:57,270
One day you'll learn how many T's are in extraterrestrial.

1910
01:27:57,690 --> 01:27:58,030
Four.

1911
01:27:58,470 --> 01:28:00,450
I already knew that, I just wanted you to spell it out.

1912
01:28:02,590 --> 01:28:03,730
Did I not do it correctly?

1913
01:28:03,910 --> 01:28:04,650
Is it not tied?

1914
01:28:04,990 --> 01:28:06,150
I think I need...

1915
01:28:06,150 --> 01:28:07,910
No, because you can't tie it.

1916
01:28:07,910 --> 01:28:11,490
Yeah, because somebody didn't teach me how to tie a knot.

1917
01:28:13,870 --> 01:28:14,990
How do I do it?

1918
01:28:16,170 --> 01:28:17,410
How did you tie a knot?

1919
01:28:18,190 --> 01:28:19,250
Is this how you tie knots?

1920
01:28:20,410 --> 01:28:21,750
What button do I press?

1921
01:28:22,050 --> 01:28:23,450
Oh, I figured it out!

1922
01:28:28,910 --> 01:28:29,790
And then...

1923
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:34,520
How did you do it?

1924
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:38,080
I have a knot tied over there.

1925
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,620
Yeah, and then you have to press it again here.

1926
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:44,660
Untied it.

1927
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:49,970
Oh, wait!

1928
01:28:50,150 --> 01:28:50,510
Push it!

1929
01:28:52,530 --> 01:28:53,030
Wait, wait, wait.

1930
01:28:53,430 --> 01:28:53,790
What?

1931
01:28:54,350 --> 01:28:55,750
Will it let you push the bucket here?

1932
01:28:56,170 --> 01:28:56,590
Maybe.

1933
01:28:59,270 --> 01:28:59,750
No.

1934
01:29:00,430 --> 01:29:00,730
Oh.

1935
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:03,630
Then why does it let us connect here?

1936
01:29:04,990 --> 01:29:06,270
Because you're on it?

1937
01:29:06,830 --> 01:29:07,610
I don't know.

1938
01:29:08,670 --> 01:29:09,450
I tied a knot.

1939
01:29:10,090 --> 01:29:11,110
I did my job.

1940
01:29:12,490 --> 01:29:13,750
Oh, we can tie one there?

1941
01:29:14,230 --> 01:29:15,370
Yeah, right here.

1942
01:29:15,590 --> 01:29:15,950
No, no, no.

1943
01:29:15,990 --> 01:29:16,930
I meant on the corner.

1944
01:29:18,450 --> 01:29:19,670
Oh, you did it!

1945
01:29:20,390 --> 01:29:21,650
See, that was so hard.

1946
01:29:23,570 --> 01:29:24,230
Alright, your turn.

1947
01:29:24,430 --> 01:29:25,130
Wait, wait, wait.

1948
01:29:25,930 --> 01:29:27,890
Because I think we have to tie it up there, right?

1949
01:29:28,290 --> 01:29:28,850
Oh, yeah.

1950
01:29:31,510 --> 01:29:33,110
So maybe I have to do...

1951
01:29:33,650 --> 01:29:35,130
Wait, but how do we get to that side?

1952
01:29:36,370 --> 01:29:38,350
Oh, maybe we have to push the bucket down here.

1953
01:29:39,230 --> 01:29:41,790
Because we got used as a step.

1954
01:29:44,050 --> 01:29:45,530
And then we gotta do this.

1955
01:29:46,770 --> 01:29:48,470
And then...

1956
01:29:48,470 --> 01:29:49,650
Swing around.

1957
01:29:50,190 --> 01:29:52,070
Like a little merry-go-round.

1958
01:29:53,870 --> 01:29:54,610
Yippee!

1959
01:29:57,750 --> 01:29:58,590
Yippee!

1960
01:29:59,710 --> 01:30:01,050
We did it!

1961
01:30:03,710 --> 01:30:05,870
Do we not need the bucket anymore?

1962
01:30:08,850 --> 01:30:09,650
We do!

1963
01:30:10,030 --> 01:30:11,390
Why else would we make a bridge?

1964
01:30:11,830 --> 01:30:13,010
See, because we need to get up here.

1965
01:30:14,510 --> 01:30:14,950
See?

1966
01:30:16,710 --> 01:30:17,510
We did it!

1967
01:30:17,790 --> 01:30:19,170
Why did you help me?

1968
01:30:19,430 --> 01:30:20,030
I did!

1969
01:30:23,010 --> 01:30:25,590
Last time I helped, you wanted me not to help.

1970
01:30:25,690 --> 01:30:27,290
So I just let you do your thing.

1971
01:30:30,070 --> 01:30:30,510
Okay.

1972
01:30:34,290 --> 01:30:35,250
And then...

1973
01:30:35,250 --> 01:30:36,210
We climb up.

1974
01:30:37,950 --> 01:30:39,590
Okay, and then we climb up.

1975
01:30:39,710 --> 01:30:40,330
And then you swing.

1976
01:30:40,430 --> 01:30:40,810
You swing.

1977
01:30:41,070 --> 01:30:41,510
You swing.

1978
01:30:42,990 --> 01:30:43,470
You...

1979
01:30:48,690 --> 01:30:49,590
You swing.

1980
01:30:49,970 --> 01:30:50,970
That's it!

1981
01:30:51,370 --> 01:30:53,250
Oh my god, you're so smart, Goomy.

1982
01:30:54,530 --> 01:30:57,670
I don't want to hear it after I figured out the first couple of puzzles.

1983
01:30:58,710 --> 01:31:00,090
You're so smart.

1984
01:31:00,930 --> 01:31:01,410
Wowee!

1985
01:31:05,250 --> 01:31:05,450
You swing.

1986
01:31:05,530 --> 01:31:06,110
You swing.

1987
01:31:06,570 --> 01:31:07,790
I know I swing!

1988
01:31:07,930 --> 01:31:15,710
You gotta chill out.

1989
01:31:16,370 --> 01:31:17,890
You gotta relax a little.

1990
01:31:22,750 --> 01:31:24,250
I'm just helping out.

1991
01:31:26,830 --> 01:31:28,270
I'm just trying to help out.

1992
01:31:28,370 --> 01:31:30,090
And then we do this.

1993
01:31:31,330 --> 01:31:33,230
And then do like a...

1994
01:31:33,230 --> 01:31:33,850
Come on.

1995
01:31:34,090 --> 01:31:35,490
There's seven chapters, Goomy.

1996
01:31:35,670 --> 01:31:38,130
We gotta speedrun this.

1997
01:31:38,190 --> 01:31:39,730
We're supposed to be gamers.

1998
01:31:41,050 --> 01:31:41,610
Alright.

1999
01:31:42,070 --> 01:31:42,590
Spin.

2000
01:31:42,890 --> 01:31:43,150
Go.

2001
01:31:45,930 --> 01:31:48,750
I'm very supportive of my wife.

2002
01:31:51,750 --> 01:31:54,270
I'm glad I had a filling breakfast before this.

2003
01:32:00,150 --> 01:32:00,710
Alright.

2004
01:32:00,710 --> 01:32:00,910
Alright.

2005
01:32:01,350 --> 01:32:02,390
We gotta swing.

2006
01:32:04,190 --> 01:32:06,010
We gotta swing.

2007
01:32:06,170 --> 01:32:06,330
Woo!

2008
01:32:06,750 --> 01:32:07,130
Okay.

2009
01:32:07,330 --> 01:32:07,710
Nice.

2010
01:32:08,270 --> 01:32:09,430
I knew you could do it.

2011
01:32:10,830 --> 01:32:12,890
I knew you could do it.

2012
01:32:13,310 --> 01:32:14,510
We're so good together.

2013
01:32:16,550 --> 01:32:18,750
Yeah, she's saying that out of love, guys.

2014
01:32:19,470 --> 01:32:20,930
She doesn't actually hate me.

2015
01:32:20,990 --> 01:32:21,970
That's just her acting.

2016
01:32:22,630 --> 01:32:24,690
That's just her acting, guys.

2017
01:32:24,830 --> 01:32:25,510
She's just...

2018
01:32:25,510 --> 01:32:27,310
I thought we said we're not gonna be completionists.

2019
01:32:27,330 --> 01:32:28,070
What's going on?

2020
01:32:30,710 --> 01:32:30,870
Okay.

2021
01:32:34,030 --> 01:32:35,390
What are you trying to do?

2022
01:32:36,450 --> 01:32:36,570
What?

2023
01:32:38,350 --> 01:32:40,710
No, what the fuck?

2024
01:32:40,890 --> 01:32:43,030
What the fuck?

2025
01:32:43,950 --> 01:32:45,230
What the fuck?

2026
01:32:46,530 --> 01:32:49,350
Yeah, but why the fuck did you go with death?

2027
01:32:49,810 --> 01:32:51,350
Because then how are we...

2028
01:32:51,350 --> 01:32:53,710
How are the kids little dull people?

2029
01:32:54,250 --> 01:32:56,330
Because we're like a figment of their imagination.

2030
01:32:56,570 --> 01:32:57,710
I don't fucking know.

2031
01:32:57,710 --> 01:32:59,050
Oh, I wanna go for death?

2032
01:33:00,950 --> 01:33:01,870
Oh, thank you.

2033
01:33:01,990 --> 01:33:03,590
Oh, you're not gonna help me pull this?

2034
01:33:04,430 --> 01:33:06,250
You're not gonna help me pull this?

2035
01:33:06,310 --> 01:33:07,670
You're gonna make me do everything?

2036
01:33:09,550 --> 01:33:11,050
Oh, I knew it.

2037
01:33:11,190 --> 01:33:12,170
I knew it.

2038
01:33:12,550 --> 01:33:12,810
Alright.

2039
01:33:18,590 --> 01:33:19,730
What do we do here?

2040
01:33:19,770 --> 01:33:20,730
We gotta pull the other thing.

2041
01:33:20,810 --> 01:33:21,210
Your turn.

2042
01:33:28,930 --> 01:33:29,850
Alright, let's go.

2043
01:33:29,950 --> 01:33:30,330
Let go.

2044
01:33:30,330 --> 01:33:30,390
Let go.

2045
01:33:32,030 --> 01:33:34,450
Yeah, she's just a tsundere, guys.

2046
01:33:35,450 --> 01:33:36,330
She's just...

2047
01:33:36,330 --> 01:33:37,850
She's just acting.

2048
01:33:40,170 --> 01:33:42,210
We gotta spin together.

2049
01:33:42,870 --> 01:33:45,070
We gotta spin together, Gumi!

2050
01:33:47,050 --> 01:33:48,390
Oh my god.

2051
01:33:53,030 --> 01:33:53,950
Please.

2052
01:33:56,610 --> 01:33:57,950
I'm tired.

2053
01:34:06,030 --> 01:34:06,570
I'm tired.

2054
01:34:06,570 --> 01:34:07,870
You're fucking welcome.

2055
01:34:16,130 --> 01:34:18,170
Castle your Mario Kart collab right now.

2056
01:34:24,350 --> 01:34:25,190
It's fine.

2057
01:34:25,590 --> 01:34:27,350
Kenji doesn't even...

2058
01:34:27,350 --> 01:34:28,810
Actually, he set a couple alarms.

2059
01:34:28,950 --> 01:34:30,110
Maybe he will be on time.

2060
01:34:32,270 --> 01:34:33,770
Oh my god.

2061
01:34:33,770 --> 01:34:35,590
Oh my god.

2062
01:34:35,970 --> 01:34:37,570
Oh my god.

2063
01:34:38,110 --> 01:34:38,750
Clearly...

2064
01:34:38,750 --> 01:34:41,590
Because I'm trying to pull you to this side.

2065
01:34:41,650 --> 01:34:43,150
You fucking idiot.

2066
01:34:43,730 --> 01:34:45,210
We could have swung together.

2067
01:34:47,030 --> 01:34:49,910
Yeah, you could do that without my help.

2068
01:34:52,510 --> 01:34:53,430
Let's go back.

2069
01:34:53,530 --> 01:34:55,250
No, we're not.

2070
01:34:55,310 --> 01:34:56,190
We're not going back.

2071
01:34:56,870 --> 01:34:58,650
I already know what you're like.

2072
01:34:58,650 --> 01:34:59,610
It's too late.

2073
01:34:59,750 --> 01:35:00,550
You can't change it.

2074
01:35:00,650 --> 01:35:02,670
You can't change the past.

2075
01:35:03,570 --> 01:35:04,290
Get out.

2076
01:35:05,890 --> 01:35:07,490
You can't change what you did.

2077
01:35:07,750 --> 01:35:10,650
You gotta live with your mistakes.

2078
01:35:12,210 --> 01:35:13,330
You gotta live with it.

2079
01:35:13,390 --> 01:35:15,110
You gotta live with it.

2080
01:35:15,190 --> 01:35:15,650
Get over here.

2081
01:35:16,170 --> 01:35:17,150
We can do it.

2082
01:35:17,550 --> 01:35:20,190
I refuse to do it.

2083
01:35:20,270 --> 01:35:20,910
Get over here.

2084
01:35:24,070 --> 01:35:27,550
You think you can just fix your mistakes like that and I'll forgive you?

2085
01:35:28,950 --> 01:35:29,910
What mistake?

2086
01:35:30,050 --> 01:35:31,530
I'm the one that made the jump.

2087
01:35:32,310 --> 01:35:34,910
And who pulled you up there?

2088
01:35:35,450 --> 01:35:36,950
I said we didn't need to be pulled.

2089
01:35:37,090 --> 01:35:38,710
I said I didn't need to be pulled.

2090
01:35:46,590 --> 01:35:48,110
What do we do here?

2091
01:35:49,270 --> 01:35:49,930
Do the jump.

2092
01:35:49,990 --> 01:35:50,610
Make the jump.

2093
01:35:52,710 --> 01:35:54,010
I'm holding on to you.

2094
01:35:57,270 --> 01:35:59,710
Why do I have to do the work?

2095
01:36:01,170 --> 01:36:02,830
My job is to look pretty.

2096
01:36:06,170 --> 01:36:07,050
What are you going to say to that?

2097
01:36:07,950 --> 01:36:08,550
What are you going to say to that?

2098
01:36:13,170 --> 01:36:13,810
What are you going to say?

2099
01:36:21,470 --> 01:36:22,490
What do you have to say about that?

2100
01:36:28,770 --> 01:36:29,170
Nothing.

2101
01:36:29,390 --> 01:36:32,590
I can't say anything.

2102
01:36:34,030 --> 01:36:45,110
I don't know what you want from me.

2103
01:36:45,390 --> 01:36:46,850
I don't know what you want from me.

2104
01:36:46,950 --> 01:36:48,730
I don't know what you want from me.

2105
01:36:48,790 --> 01:36:49,730
That's what I'm going to say.

2106
01:36:52,330 --> 01:36:54,030
Make the jump.

2107
01:36:54,030 --> 01:36:55,090
Make the jump.

2108
01:36:56,230 --> 01:36:57,390
Here we go.

2109
01:37:01,270 --> 01:37:03,150
You see, you see guys.

2110
01:37:03,250 --> 01:37:04,250
You know when to not.

2111
01:37:05,010 --> 01:37:07,910
There are moments when you know you should not say anything.

2112
01:37:08,350 --> 01:37:16,930
There are moments in life where you know when to not say anything.

2113
01:37:24,450 --> 01:37:25,710
What the fuck?

2114
01:37:25,830 --> 01:37:27,090
How do two kids do this?

2115
01:37:27,290 --> 01:37:28,230
Are they teenagers?

2116
01:37:29,070 --> 01:37:30,690
They must be.

2117
01:37:31,030 --> 01:37:33,450
They might be children or tweens.

2118
01:37:33,530 --> 01:37:34,510
They could be tweens.

2119
01:37:34,770 --> 01:37:36,110
They look like tweens.

2120
01:37:36,210 --> 01:37:37,910
I haven't heard the term tweens in so long.

2121
01:37:41,730 --> 01:37:42,750
Hey guys.

2122
01:37:43,270 --> 01:37:45,870
You like watching?

2123
01:37:55,330 --> 01:37:56,010
Weeeee.

2124
01:37:57,270 --> 01:37:59,050
Okay, I have an idea.

2125
01:38:03,130 --> 01:38:03,810
Yeah.

2126
01:38:09,850 --> 01:38:10,790
Wait, what?

2127
01:38:13,350 --> 01:38:13,690
Oh.

2128
01:38:15,470 --> 01:38:16,290
Look at us.

2129
01:38:16,350 --> 01:38:17,110
Look at us go.

2130
01:38:20,430 --> 01:38:21,830
The fuck are tweens?

2131
01:38:21,830 --> 01:38:24,050
It's like in between teenager and child.

2132
01:38:26,010 --> 01:38:26,530
Adolescence.

2133
01:38:26,710 --> 01:38:26,930
Yeah.

2134
01:38:29,310 --> 01:38:34,090
Wait, what's the age for teenagers?

2135
01:38:34,370 --> 01:38:35,030
I don't even remember.

2136
01:38:37,190 --> 01:38:41,550
I don't even remember what the cutoff is between tweens and teenagers.

2137
01:38:42,890 --> 01:38:43,930
Wait, how do we do this?

2138
01:38:44,390 --> 01:38:45,230
You didn't tie it.

2139
01:38:45,830 --> 01:38:46,630
I did tie it.

2140
01:38:47,270 --> 01:38:48,930
Yeah, I did.

2141
01:38:48,930 --> 01:38:51,130
I just untied it.

2142
01:38:51,350 --> 01:38:52,530
Yeah, why did you untie it?

2143
01:38:57,160 --> 01:38:58,400
Just get up here.

2144
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:00,400
Oh.

2145
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:03,100
But don't you have to...

2146
01:39:03,100 --> 01:39:04,120
Don't we need the wrench?

2147
01:39:05,580 --> 01:39:06,280
What wrench?

2148
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:06,980
Oh.

2149
01:39:12,020 --> 01:39:14,000
It's like between...

2150
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,540
Like 10 and 11, no?

2151
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:16,440
I don't know.

2152
01:39:16,740 --> 01:39:17,520
It's just 10 and 11?

2153
01:39:17,780 --> 01:39:18,460
I guess so.

2154
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:20,740
It's like 6th grade.

2155
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:22,180
I believe.

2156
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:24,080
Yeah, tweens are 6th graders.

2157
01:39:26,780 --> 01:39:28,440
Oh, I don't need to spin this or anything?

2158
01:39:28,840 --> 01:39:30,100
I think it's just...

2159
01:39:30,100 --> 01:39:32,540
Oh, I think it's slanted so you fall down.

2160
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:33,340
That's why.

2161
01:39:35,320 --> 01:39:36,900
I assume that's how physics work.

2162
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:41,460
Or that crow fucking comes up there and just fucking eats you.

2163
01:39:42,140 --> 01:39:43,200
I hope it does.

2164
01:39:43,220 --> 01:39:43,620
Me too.

2165
01:39:43,620 --> 01:39:43,680
Oh.

2166
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:47,660
Get up here.

2167
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:52,040
That's why I was thinking about it.

2168
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:54,700
What's this?

2169
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:55,800
Do you have to tie this?

2170
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:58,500
Yeah, because then it makes us jump up.

2171
01:39:59,400 --> 01:39:59,840
Oh.

2172
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:03,740
Oh, okay.

2173
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:04,560
And then we do that.

2174
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:05,220
Or fling it.

2175
01:40:06,700 --> 01:40:07,340
Get over here.

2176
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:09,700
Get over here.

2177
01:40:10,240 --> 01:40:11,300
I need you to let go.

2178
01:40:11,540 --> 01:40:11,960
Trust me.

2179
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:12,500
Let go.

2180
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:14,420
It's not gonna be like Titanic.

2181
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:16,000
Let go.

2182
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:19,860
Never let go.

2183
01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:21,320
Never let go, Jack.

2184
01:40:25,740 --> 01:40:26,540
Alright, here we go.

2185
01:40:26,700 --> 01:40:28,980
I've never seen Titanic ever in my life.

2186
01:40:29,100 --> 01:40:30,600
I've never seen the full movie.

2187
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:34,200
I've always seen like...

2188
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:35,560
Wait, how do we do this?

2189
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:37,960
And then you connect it and then you tie a rope.

2190
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:39,140
I did it.

2191
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:41,200
Oh my god, we worked together!

2192
01:40:43,980 --> 01:40:44,460
Okay.

2193
01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:45,980
Okay.

2194
01:40:47,100 --> 01:40:48,440
That's why we can't have nice things.

2195
01:40:48,540 --> 01:40:49,440
This is exactly why.

2196
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:54,560
We finally worked together and then you didn't even commit to it.

2197
01:40:55,320 --> 01:40:56,020
I committed.

2198
01:40:56,640 --> 01:40:57,560
You didn't even commit.

2199
01:40:57,640 --> 01:40:58,320
You let go.

2200
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:00,220
What the hell is happening?

2201
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:01,780
It's climbing on the walls and shit.

2202
01:41:03,620 --> 01:41:04,100
Parkour.

2203
01:41:04,820 --> 01:41:06,060
Oh, you couldn't do that?

2204
01:41:06,420 --> 01:41:07,440
That's alright, you'll learn.

2205
01:41:08,340 --> 01:41:10,820
I'm watching the pattern of it, you fucking bitch.

2206
01:41:12,260 --> 01:41:13,600
I'm analyzing it.

2207
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:19,840
Oh, there's more.

2208
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:21,300
Wait, what?

2209
01:41:21,680 --> 01:41:22,280
Oh, here.

2210
01:41:27,030 --> 01:41:28,130
Oh, it's gonna touch you.

2211
01:41:28,310 --> 01:41:29,430
It's gonna touch you.

2212
01:41:31,150 --> 01:41:32,630
I wish you could push in this game.

2213
01:41:38,450 --> 01:41:39,370
Get off me.

2214
01:41:39,990 --> 01:41:40,430
What?

2215
01:41:40,630 --> 01:41:42,770
I thought this was a loving...

2216
01:41:42,770 --> 01:41:44,890
I thought this was a loving relationship.

2217
01:41:45,330 --> 01:41:47,350
Oh, it's like Mario!

2218
01:41:49,290 --> 01:41:50,950
You got this, I believe in you.

2219
01:41:52,230 --> 01:41:53,370
Go, Goomy, go.

2220
01:41:54,410 --> 01:41:55,710
Go, Goomy, go.

2221
01:41:57,650 --> 01:41:59,870
I think you were supposed to...

2222
01:42:00,690 --> 01:42:02,510
I think you were supposed to...

2223
01:42:04,530 --> 01:42:05,790
Goomy, why aren't you here?

2224
01:42:06,410 --> 01:42:07,410
Goomy, come on.

2225
01:42:07,630 --> 01:42:09,110
We're waiting for you.

2226
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:10,910
Come on, Goomy.

2227
01:42:15,810 --> 01:42:16,370
Alright,

2228
01:42:20,870 --> 01:42:21,390
I'm ready.

2229
01:42:25,090 --> 01:42:26,290
Why didn't you spot me?

2230
01:42:27,250 --> 01:42:30,490
Why didn't you spot for me?

2231
01:42:30,650 --> 01:42:32,710
This is technically the gym.

2232
01:42:32,710 --> 01:42:34,550
This is...

2233
01:42:34,550 --> 01:42:36,990
I'm working out right now.

2234
01:42:40,750 --> 01:42:41,870
Holy shit.

2235
01:42:43,490 --> 01:42:44,350
That's insane.

2236
01:42:45,330 --> 01:42:46,350
Wait, what does this do?

2237
01:42:47,710 --> 01:42:47,990
Oh.

2238
01:42:50,470 --> 01:42:51,710
You're supposed to hold...

2239
01:42:51,710 --> 01:42:53,410
You let go, you let go.

2240
01:42:53,750 --> 01:42:55,470
Alright, I'll hold on.

2241
01:42:55,970 --> 01:42:56,470
I'll hold on.

2242
01:42:56,990 --> 01:42:57,850
I didn't even notice.

2243
01:42:59,650 --> 01:43:01,510
You see, you would've been ready.

2244
01:43:01,710 --> 01:43:03,430
But you weren't ready for me.

2245
01:43:05,770 --> 01:43:07,350
I don't think I'll ever be ready.

2246
01:43:08,430 --> 01:43:09,090
What are you doing?

2247
01:43:09,150 --> 01:43:11,070
Why did it take you 20 years to tie a knot?

2248
01:43:12,430 --> 01:43:13,410
I tied it.

2249
01:43:13,550 --> 01:43:15,910
It's just I'm thinking about how to get over to the other side.

2250
01:43:16,450 --> 01:43:16,790
Oh.

2251
01:43:17,350 --> 01:43:17,990
Wait, you're right.

2252
01:43:19,330 --> 01:43:20,750
No, you have to go on the other side.

2253
01:43:20,850 --> 01:43:23,250
Yeah, and then you tie that.

2254
01:43:23,250 --> 01:43:24,010
And then, yeah.

2255
01:43:24,310 --> 01:43:24,990
Okay, that's fine.

2256
01:43:25,090 --> 01:43:25,890
You can do that again.

2257
01:43:28,750 --> 01:43:30,390
It doesn't blow me when I'm midair?

2258
01:43:30,670 --> 01:43:32,030
No, you have to be in the hole.

2259
01:43:32,690 --> 01:43:33,530
The hole's the goal.

2260
01:43:34,710 --> 01:43:35,070
Okay.

2261
01:43:36,110 --> 01:43:37,230
I'm going into the hole.

2262
01:43:38,230 --> 01:43:39,590
No, you're not supposed to go in the hole.

2263
01:43:39,690 --> 01:43:42,190
You need to tie that thing and then you go in the hole.

2264
01:43:43,370 --> 01:43:44,230
You gotta be patient.

2265
01:43:45,190 --> 01:43:46,250
I need to get close to it.

2266
01:43:46,770 --> 01:43:47,830
I need to get close to it.

2267
01:43:48,190 --> 01:43:49,270
Just let go.

2268
01:43:49,270 --> 01:43:50,170
Just let go.

2269
01:43:50,170 --> 01:43:50,870
What are you doing?

2270
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:54,730
Okay, now you drop down so you can go to...

2271
01:43:54,730 --> 01:43:56,190
You can tie the knot on that thing.

2272
01:43:56,290 --> 01:43:57,390
And then you jump in the hole.

2273
01:44:00,510 --> 01:44:01,810
What are you so scared of?

2274
01:44:02,910 --> 01:44:03,510
The hole.

2275
01:44:08,330 --> 01:44:10,090
The hole's not that scary, Gumi.

2276
01:44:12,190 --> 01:44:13,350
There we go.

2277
01:44:13,510 --> 01:44:13,810
See?

2278
01:44:14,290 --> 01:44:15,210
We did it.

2279
01:44:18,050 --> 01:44:19,050
Alright, nice.

2280
01:44:19,730 --> 01:44:21,130
It's gonna be...

2281
01:44:21,130 --> 01:44:21,910
Maybe we...

2282
01:44:21,910 --> 01:44:23,110
No, we can finish this game.

2283
01:44:23,130 --> 01:44:23,950
I believe in us.

2284
01:44:24,990 --> 01:44:25,610
Untie it.

2285
01:44:27,790 --> 01:44:29,850
I think we can finish this game.

2286
01:44:29,970 --> 01:44:31,110
It's not that bad.

2287
01:44:35,990 --> 01:44:36,850
Wait, what?

2288
01:44:40,190 --> 01:44:40,650
Oh!

2289
01:44:41,070 --> 01:44:41,930
We're supposed to turn it.

2290
01:44:42,570 --> 01:44:43,510
You're supposed to turn it.

2291
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:50,060
What are you doing?

2292
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:53,000
How do I go up there and turn it?

2293
01:44:58,950 --> 01:44:59,610
I don't know.

2294
01:45:01,610 --> 01:45:03,010
We're just slamming our heads.

2295
01:45:05,630 --> 01:45:07,990
You're the one that's been jumping the cannon!

2296
01:45:08,490 --> 01:45:09,930
No, I don't know what you're talking about.

2297
01:45:10,190 --> 01:45:12,070
There's not a yarn thing to attach it.

2298
01:45:12,510 --> 01:45:12,870
Is there?

2299
01:45:15,570 --> 01:45:16,530
Maybe like...

2300
01:45:18,670 --> 01:45:20,130
Wait, there has to be.

2301
01:45:20,630 --> 01:45:20,950
Right?

2302
01:45:22,770 --> 01:45:23,230
Oh!

2303
01:45:23,730 --> 01:45:25,490
See, I told you we gotta turn it.

2304
01:45:28,130 --> 01:45:29,410
Okay, and then...

2305
01:45:29,410 --> 01:45:30,410
I do this.

2306
01:45:31,290 --> 01:45:32,450
And you jump there.

2307
01:45:34,190 --> 01:45:35,250
And then you...

2308
01:45:35,250 --> 01:45:35,870
Use it to swing.

2309
01:45:36,150 --> 01:45:36,710
Use the momentum.

2310
01:45:40,430 --> 01:45:41,310
No, no, sorry.

2311
01:45:41,390 --> 01:45:42,390
I meant you climb up.

2312
01:45:43,610 --> 01:45:44,790
I mean, you could do that too.

2313
01:45:46,790 --> 01:45:48,090
No, I meant like...

2314
01:45:48,090 --> 01:45:49,310
I meant like you...

2315
01:45:49,310 --> 01:45:49,710
Okay.

2316
01:45:50,750 --> 01:45:51,530
That's fine.

2317
01:45:51,890 --> 01:45:52,470
That's fine.

2318
01:45:52,590 --> 01:45:53,650
We all make mistakes here.

2319
01:45:54,150 --> 01:45:56,910
You want me to climb up and then jump up, right?

2320
01:45:57,230 --> 01:45:59,090
Then why would you say swing?

2321
01:46:01,250 --> 01:46:02,650
And then you push that.

2322
01:46:05,650 --> 01:46:06,610
And then...

2323
01:46:11,150 --> 01:46:11,630
See?

2324
01:46:11,770 --> 01:46:12,350
It's that easy.

2325
01:46:14,230 --> 01:46:15,030
Look at that.

2326
01:46:15,230 --> 01:46:16,090
We work so well together.

2327
01:46:20,530 --> 01:46:22,730
You're like a little cockroach scuttling around.

2328
01:46:24,210 --> 01:46:25,090
I'm scuttling!

2329
01:46:25,230 --> 01:46:25,910
I'm doing it!

2330
01:46:27,770 --> 01:46:29,790
I'm actually scuttling right now.

2331
01:46:30,690 --> 01:46:32,390
I feel like playing with you...

2332
01:46:32,390 --> 01:46:34,710
Makes me feel like I'm playing League of Legends in my brain.

2333
01:46:35,010 --> 01:46:35,710
Wait, why?

2334
01:46:35,950 --> 01:46:36,790
What does that even mean?

2335
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:44,660
Oh my god, it's showing me a video game.

2336
01:46:46,580 --> 01:46:47,620
See, guys?

2337
01:46:47,820 --> 01:46:48,580
Therapy works.

2338
01:46:54,910 --> 01:46:55,850
That's the portal.

2339
01:46:58,110 --> 01:46:59,570
Where is it going?

2340
01:47:03,670 --> 01:47:04,730
We did it!

2341
01:47:04,870 --> 01:47:06,210
We finished Gap Chapter 2!

2342
01:47:08,430 --> 01:47:10,250
Five more chapters to go, Gumi!

2343
01:47:10,670 --> 01:47:14,010
Five more chapters of absolute bliss.

2344
01:47:20,470 --> 01:47:24,190
Guys, in five chapters, our marriage will be saved.

2345
01:47:24,190 --> 01:47:24,930
Alright.

2346
01:47:29,430 --> 01:47:33,610
That's how easy couples counseling is.

2347
01:47:34,530 --> 01:47:36,130
It's just that easy.

2348
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:41,750
I think we can speedrun these.

2349
01:47:41,790 --> 01:47:43,450
These puzzles are actually so easy.

2350
01:47:43,950 --> 01:47:44,710
Not gonna lie.

2351
01:47:45,550 --> 01:47:48,650
I'm like 100% sure we can speedrun this.

2352
01:47:50,970 --> 01:47:52,830
I think that's an elevator, right?

2353
01:47:56,570 --> 01:47:57,010
Okay.

2354
01:47:57,010 --> 01:47:57,430
Do I let go?

2355
01:48:00,370 --> 01:48:01,250
Oh, okay.

2356
01:48:01,330 --> 01:48:02,870
I'm gonna push this and you're gonna push the...

2357
01:48:02,870 --> 01:48:03,350
Turn the knob.

2358
01:48:05,790 --> 01:48:07,090
The other side.

2359
01:48:07,670 --> 01:48:08,330
That's why it's okay.

2360
01:48:12,050 --> 01:48:13,910
I think I want to kill you.

2361
01:48:15,130 --> 01:48:16,610
I'm giving you encouragement!

2362
01:48:18,330 --> 01:48:19,430
I want to kill you.

2363
01:48:19,450 --> 01:48:20,350
I'm literally encouraging you.

2364
01:48:20,350 --> 01:48:21,550
I'm literally encouraging you.

2365
01:48:21,670 --> 01:48:22,610
What more do you want from me?

2366
01:48:22,990 --> 01:48:29,310
What more do you want from me?

2367
01:48:29,390 --> 01:48:32,730
You'll never be satisfied if even that doesn't save the marriage.

2368
01:48:37,550 --> 01:48:38,390
Time me out.

2369
01:48:44,130 --> 01:48:46,530
You don't need to look at the game anyway.

2370
01:48:50,350 --> 01:48:50,870
Let's go, let's speedrun!

2371
01:48:53,770 --> 01:48:58,970
We can watch the cutscene while we're speedrunning!

2372
01:49:00,170 --> 01:49:01,570
Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go.

2373
01:49:02,310 --> 01:49:03,070
I'm already...

2374
01:49:03,070 --> 01:49:04,470
What do you want from me?

2375
01:49:04,730 --> 01:49:08,190
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

2376
01:49:08,330 --> 01:49:09,670
I think we fucked up the speedrun already.

2377
01:49:10,170 --> 01:49:11,610
We're supposed to push the flowers.

2378
01:49:13,010 --> 01:49:13,970
Oh, wait, what?

2379
01:49:14,410 --> 01:49:14,670
Oh.

2380
01:49:16,190 --> 01:49:16,950
We're speedrunning.

2381
01:49:16,950 --> 01:49:16,990
We're speedrunning.

2382
01:49:17,450 --> 01:49:18,330
Wait, then what do we do here?

2383
01:49:22,500 --> 01:49:22,840
No.

2384
01:49:24,340 --> 01:49:24,820
No.

2385
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:27,360
I'm trying to push the flowers.

2386
01:49:29,360 --> 01:49:30,300
Flowers this?

2387
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:31,880
No.

2388
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:33,480
What?

2389
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:34,080
What flowers?

2390
01:49:35,160 --> 01:49:35,820
What flowers?

2391
01:49:36,420 --> 01:49:38,560
Guys, I think we're failing the speedrun.

2392
01:49:38,780 --> 01:49:39,260
Wait, go?

2393
01:49:40,420 --> 01:49:40,880
I don't know.

2394
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:43,940
What do you mean?

2395
01:49:44,740 --> 01:49:45,380
I don't...

2396
01:49:45,380 --> 01:49:47,100
You wanted to push the flowers off the desk.

2397
01:49:47,720 --> 01:49:48,280
Do it.

2398
01:49:48,540 --> 01:49:49,660
Why don't you try swinging?

2399
01:49:51,480 --> 01:49:52,320
Let go.

2400
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:52,940
Go ahead.

2401
01:49:54,820 --> 01:49:57,700
No, no, why don't you try swinging?

2402
01:49:57,860 --> 01:49:59,260
Clearly, you're better at it than me.

2403
01:49:59,560 --> 01:50:00,140
No, no, no.

2404
01:50:00,380 --> 01:50:01,600
I'm giving you a strong...

2405
01:50:02,100 --> 01:50:03,860
You don't even know how to take compliments!

2406
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:05,120
This is why it's not working!

2407
01:50:10,620 --> 01:50:13,280
You have issues to work on as well!

2408
01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:15,520
It's not just a me problem!

2409
01:50:17,240 --> 01:50:19,600
You made me like this!

2410
01:50:26,370 --> 01:50:28,130
Go, go do your swing.

2411
01:50:28,210 --> 01:50:29,130
You're really good at this.

2412
01:50:39,610 --> 01:50:40,190
There, see?

2413
01:50:43,850 --> 01:50:44,410
Alright,

2414
01:50:50,280 --> 01:50:50,600
here you go.

2415
01:50:50,640 --> 01:50:51,020
Your turn.

2416
01:50:51,480 --> 01:50:52,020
Do your swing.

2417
01:50:53,860 --> 01:50:55,660
Do the swing.

2418
01:50:57,920 --> 01:50:59,200
Do the swing.

2419
01:50:59,420 --> 01:50:59,720
Oh,

2420
01:51:03,700 --> 01:51:03,920
shit.

2421
01:51:04,100 --> 01:51:04,460
Wait, what?

2422
01:51:05,820 --> 01:51:07,340
Wait, how did I miss that?

2423
01:51:09,820 --> 01:51:10,560
Speedrun.

2424
01:51:11,640 --> 01:51:12,940
Why didn't you swing?

2425
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:14,640
Don't kill me!

2426
01:51:16,240 --> 01:51:18,260
That wasn't on me.

2427
01:51:18,820 --> 01:51:20,980
That actually wasn't on me.

2428
01:51:20,980 --> 01:51:23,340
Why did you attach yourself to me?

2429
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:26,940
There you go.

2430
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:27,640
Okay, go.

2431
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:33,960
Yay!

2432
01:51:36,120 --> 01:51:37,540
We're doing it.

2433
01:51:37,940 --> 01:51:39,820
We're so good.

2434
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:42,800
You need to push the car.

2435
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:44,240
You need to push the truck.

2436
01:51:45,640 --> 01:51:47,660
I just want to stand still!

2437
01:51:48,060 --> 01:51:48,820
Fine, fine, fine!

2438
01:51:48,820 --> 01:51:49,720
Fine, I'm fine!

2439
01:51:50,300 --> 01:51:51,540
I'm willing to compromise.

2440
01:51:51,740 --> 01:51:54,100
I will do the brute work here.

2441
01:51:55,540 --> 01:51:56,740
Fine, is this what you wanted?

2442
01:51:56,780 --> 01:51:57,440
This is what you wanted.

2443
01:51:57,540 --> 01:51:58,160
You want me to push?

2444
01:51:59,400 --> 01:52:01,900
Princess, this is what you wanted, princess.

2445
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:03,820
Okay, princess, you go.

2446
01:52:05,020 --> 01:52:05,340
You go.

2447
01:52:06,060 --> 01:52:07,400
Don't worry, princess.

2448
01:52:08,200 --> 01:52:09,440
You stay on that bullet.

2449
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,240
Don't hurt your little legs.

2450
01:52:12,380 --> 01:52:14,280
Don't strain too much.

2451
01:52:22,720 --> 01:52:23,800
What the fuck?

2452
01:52:24,300 --> 01:52:25,460
Wait, what the fuck?

2453
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:27,400
Is that guy kidnapping the children?

2454
01:52:27,660 --> 01:52:28,840
Who the fuck is that?

2455
01:52:29,660 --> 01:52:30,840
Stranger danger!

2456
01:52:32,460 --> 01:52:33,460
That's a frog.

2457
01:52:34,260 --> 01:52:35,420
Frogs aren't strangers.

2458
01:52:35,640 --> 01:52:36,040
Dammit!

2459
01:52:36,600 --> 01:52:37,100
Woah, woah, woah!

2460
01:52:38,980 --> 01:52:40,180
I'm inside of you!

2461
01:52:41,900 --> 01:52:42,500
I'm inside of you!

2462
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:43,800
I'm inside of you!

2463
01:52:45,860 --> 01:52:46,740
Just run!

2464
01:52:46,740 --> 01:52:47,100
Why?

2465
01:52:47,560 --> 01:52:47,960
Why?

2466
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:50,360
Run.

2467
01:52:50,680 --> 01:52:51,300
Just run.

2468
01:52:51,540 --> 01:52:53,620
Literally, stop pushing things.

2469
01:52:53,880 --> 01:52:55,020
Stop pushing things.

2470
01:52:55,300 --> 01:52:55,920
Just run.

2471
01:52:56,200 --> 01:52:57,200
Just jump and run.

2472
01:52:57,420 --> 01:52:58,780
Why are you pushing the can?

2473
01:52:59,080 --> 01:53:00,000
Why are you...

2474
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,120
Just run.

2475
01:53:01,300 --> 01:53:01,900
Just run.

2476
01:53:01,960 --> 01:53:03,420
You don't have to push anything.

2477
01:53:03,800 --> 01:53:05,160
Literally, that's all you have to do.

2478
01:53:05,220 --> 01:53:05,780
Just run.

2479
01:53:05,980 --> 01:53:06,600
Just run.

2480
01:53:06,660 --> 01:53:07,320
It's right here.

2481
01:53:07,480 --> 01:53:08,260
It's right here.

2482
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:10,100
That's right.

2483
01:53:16,040 --> 01:53:17,680
So, how was that?

2484
01:53:18,260 --> 01:53:19,080
How was that?

2485
01:53:20,780 --> 01:53:22,300
We didn't need it.

2486
01:53:22,440 --> 01:53:25,460
That was just... We're not here to be a completionist.

2487
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:27,200
We're here to finish the story.

2488
01:53:27,700 --> 01:53:28,560
That's our goal.

2489
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:31,660
That has always been our goal.

2490
01:53:31,700 --> 01:53:34,080
Did we actually finish the story if we didn't 100% the game?

2491
01:53:34,840 --> 01:53:35,460
Oh my god.

2492
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:36,860
Oh my god, what's going on?

2493
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:38,420
Wait, what the fuck?

2494
01:53:38,500 --> 01:53:38,940
There's multiple...

2495
01:53:41,780 --> 01:53:42,440
Wait, what?

2496
01:53:43,480 --> 01:53:44,800
Oh, we have to do the thing again.

2497
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:45,720
Okay, I'll push this.

2498
01:53:46,020 --> 01:53:46,960
Hello, little princess.

2499
01:53:47,140 --> 01:53:48,960
You ready to go over there?

2500
01:53:49,060 --> 01:53:49,920
There we go.

2501
01:53:52,220 --> 01:53:53,780
How do I get over there?

2502
01:53:56,800 --> 01:53:57,200
Oh.

2503
01:53:57,200 --> 01:53:58,340
Wait, I figured it out now.

2504
01:54:02,140 --> 01:54:02,540
Wait.

2505
01:54:02,680 --> 01:54:03,440
Wait a minute.

2506
01:54:05,620 --> 01:54:06,920
How do I get over there?

2507
01:54:12,780 --> 01:54:14,300
I mean, I think you need help.

2508
01:54:14,540 --> 01:54:15,000
I think.

2509
01:54:15,160 --> 01:54:16,340
Wait, I think I figured it out.

2510
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:16,640
Wait, wait.

2511
01:54:16,680 --> 01:54:16,980
No, no, no.

2512
01:54:16,980 --> 01:54:17,640
I figured it out.

2513
01:54:20,340 --> 01:54:21,080
Wait, what?

2514
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:22,340
Get out.

2515
01:54:22,420 --> 01:54:22,880
Get out of there.

2516
01:54:23,780 --> 01:54:25,560
Okay, we need to figure this out.

2517
01:54:34,710 --> 01:54:35,070
Unless...

2518
01:54:35,070 --> 01:54:37,950
Oh yeah, we start from the right and then...

2519
01:54:45,850 --> 01:54:47,390
Wait, how do we do this?

2520
01:54:54,660 --> 01:54:55,700
Why are you looking at hints?

2521
01:54:55,740 --> 01:54:56,700
We don't need a hint!

2522
01:54:56,840 --> 01:54:58,260
We don't need a hint!

2523
01:55:00,660 --> 01:55:03,720
We are smarter than... Did you sniffle?

2524
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:13,180
I'm sorry I raised your voice at you, but sometimes, like, you know, we don't need help.

2525
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:14,040
Okay, we...

2526
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:17,440
Why?

2527
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:23,240
Why did you pull me?

2528
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:26,180
Anything over here?

2529
01:55:26,900 --> 01:55:27,960
There's nothing over there.

2530
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:29,060
There's nothing over here.

2531
01:55:29,140 --> 01:55:30,520
There's nothing over here.

2532
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:31,460
There's nothing...

2533
01:55:32,120 --> 01:55:33,460
Why am I scary?

2534
01:55:34,040 --> 01:55:36,760
We're trying to figure out this problem together.

2535
01:55:37,100 --> 01:55:38,160
Can you jump off?

2536
01:55:38,300 --> 01:55:38,500
Okay.

2537
01:55:39,880 --> 01:55:40,920
So get up here.

2538
01:55:41,480 --> 01:55:42,120
Jump off.

2539
01:55:42,500 --> 01:55:43,660
Jump up and then off.

2540
01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:45,720
And then push the barrel.

2541
01:55:48,780 --> 01:55:50,820
And then you go over here.

2542
01:55:51,660 --> 01:55:53,460
And then you hold on to it.

2543
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:56,800
And then we did it.

2544
01:55:56,980 --> 01:55:57,400
See?

2545
01:55:57,580 --> 01:55:58,000
Look at that.

2546
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:59,400
I told you, we did not need help.

2547
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:01,240
We don't need to ask for directions.

2548
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:07,560
We didn't need to ask for directions, Goomy.

2549
01:56:10,780 --> 01:56:11,220
See?

2550
01:56:13,380 --> 01:56:15,920
I knew you were smart enough to figure it out yourself.

2551
01:56:17,640 --> 01:56:20,060
I just wanted you to use your potential.

2552
01:56:39,570 --> 01:56:43,190
Oh, this is a beautiful day, isn't it?

2553
01:56:44,290 --> 01:56:44,850
Yeah.

2554
01:56:45,550 --> 01:56:46,810
Do you need to color the flowers?

2555
01:56:47,770 --> 01:56:48,630
The what flowers?

2556
01:56:49,450 --> 01:56:51,450
Do you need to color the flowers based off our characters?

2557
01:56:52,070 --> 01:56:53,370
Oh, I think so.

2558
01:56:53,490 --> 01:56:55,350
Yeah, it's yellow and purple.

2559
01:56:56,090 --> 01:56:56,910
Or pink.

2560
01:56:57,610 --> 01:56:58,670
Oh, that's cute.

2561
01:56:59,050 --> 01:57:01,290
That's really... I like that little detail they did there.

2562
01:57:02,090 --> 01:57:02,850
Ah, demon!

2563
01:57:04,990 --> 01:57:06,130
It's following me now.

2564
01:57:06,210 --> 01:57:08,050
It's following me, so I need you to...

2565
01:57:08,050 --> 01:57:09,860
I need you to...

2566
01:57:10,890 --> 01:57:12,250
Wait, we need to do that thing again.

2567
01:57:12,290 --> 01:57:12,610
Yep.

2568
01:57:12,810 --> 01:57:13,710
Yep, we did.

2569
01:57:14,630 --> 01:57:15,910
Yep, just like that.

2570
01:57:15,970 --> 01:57:16,590
There we go.

2571
01:57:16,670 --> 01:57:17,070
Here you go.

2572
01:57:17,130 --> 01:57:17,810
I'll pull you up.

2573
01:57:17,930 --> 01:57:19,190
Don't worry, my little princess.

2574
01:57:19,350 --> 01:57:20,210
I'll pull you up.

2575
01:57:23,850 --> 01:57:24,770
All right.

2576
01:57:25,850 --> 01:57:28,890
Don't worry, I'll swing for us, too.

2577
01:57:34,230 --> 01:57:35,150
It's moose.

2578
01:57:35,530 --> 01:57:35,990
Meese.

2579
01:57:36,350 --> 01:57:36,810
Moose?

2580
01:57:37,910 --> 01:57:38,370
Meese.

2581
01:57:38,970 --> 01:57:39,890
Yeah, that's the plural form.

2582
01:57:39,950 --> 01:57:40,890
Yeah, that's the plural form.

2583
01:57:43,210 --> 01:57:44,070
It's meese.

2584
01:57:45,490 --> 01:57:47,090
Okay, you just watched me die.

2585
01:57:47,190 --> 01:57:47,890
Okay, that's cool.

2586
01:57:50,270 --> 01:57:51,230
I don't know.

2587
01:57:51,490 --> 01:57:52,050
I don't know.

2588
01:57:52,150 --> 01:57:53,310
Don't watch me die?

2589
01:57:55,170 --> 01:57:56,110
Okay, I'll close my eyes.

2590
01:57:56,110 --> 01:57:59,270
Wait, you never heard the plural form of moose before?

2591
01:58:04,330 --> 01:58:05,070
You've never?

2592
01:58:06,990 --> 01:58:08,530
I'm a California girl, Doki.

2593
01:58:08,930 --> 01:58:12,730
Yeah, it's like goose and geese, so it's like moose and meese.

2594
01:58:14,330 --> 01:58:15,830
Meese just doesn't sound mean.

2595
01:58:16,810 --> 01:58:18,630
So does geese, too.

2596
01:58:25,260 --> 01:58:25,620

2604
01:58:29,960 --> 01:58:30,760
Just hold my hand.

2605
01:58:30,820 --> 01:58:31,400
Just keep running.

2606
01:58:31,540 --> 01:58:32,060
There you go.

2607
01:58:32,200 --> 01:58:32,700
Look at that.

2608
01:58:32,760 --> 01:58:33,340
That's all that.

2609
01:58:33,500 --> 01:58:34,360
That's all you have to do.

2610
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:38,240
Oh, oh, there.

2611
01:58:38,360 --> 01:58:38,780
It's time.

2612
01:58:39,980 --> 01:58:40,340

2613
01:58:40,340 --> 01:58:42,360
Wait, how do we... How do I get this out?

2614
01:58:43,860 --> 01:58:44,860
Oh, and push this.

2615
01:58:45,420 --> 01:58:45,880
Go down.

2616
01:58:45,980 --> 01:58:46,420

01:58:50,600 --> 01:58:51,880
And then you do that.

2620
01:58:51,960 --> 01:58:53,660
And then I'm gonna go down.

2621
01:58:54,360 --> 01:58:57,200
And then... Oh, now it's following me, so I might die.

2622
01:58:58,020 --> 01:58:58,580
That's okay.

2623
01:58:58,920 --> 01:59:00,200
Like, it was a good life.

2624
01:59:01,980 --> 01:59:03,520

01:59:47,320 --> 01:59:47,760
Just stay...

2650
01:59:50,100 --> 01:59:50,480
Leave.

2651
01:59:50,480 --> 01:59:51,400
Oh, fuck.

2652
01:59:51,460 --> 01:59:51,620
Okay.

2653
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:53,180
Okay.

2654
01:59:53,880 --> 01:59:54,660
All right.

2655
01:59:54,680 --> 01:59:55,380
No, it's not.

2656
01:59:55,500 --> 01:59:56,120

It's up.

2661
01:59:59,600 --> 02:00:00,240
It's up.

2662
02:00:00,320 --> 02:00:00,920
It's up here.

2663
02:00:01,120 --> 02:00:01,960
That's not a secret.

2664
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:03,000
That's not a secret.

2665
02:00:06,600 --> 02:00:07,400
I promise.

2666
02:00:07,660 --> 02:00:09,140
Oh, the green stuff is safe.

2667
02:00:09,580 --> 02:00:12,500
The green stuff helps you, like they can't touch the green.

2668
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:14,680
They don't wanna touch grass, so we're fine.

2669
02:00:31,790 --> 02:00:34,790
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, I'm safe.

2672
02:00:36,670 --> 02:00:38,030
I am so safe.

2673
02:00:38,070 --> 02:00:38,810
I am not safe.

2674
02:00:38,890 --> 02:00:39,410
I'm not safe.

2675
02:00:39,510 --> 02:00:40,350
Just remember what you did.

2676
02:00:40,410 --> 02:00:41,090
Just remember.

2677
02:00:44,130 --> 02:00:45,710
What are you trying to say?

2678
02:00:45,790 --> 02:00:46,910
You didn't say that before.

2679
02:00:47,650 --> 02:00:48,330
I did.

2680
02:00:48,510 --> 02:00:49,130

2681
02:00:49,150 --> 02:00:50,030
I did say that.

2682
02:00:50,550 --> 02:00:53,390
Oh my god.

2683
02:00:53,450 --> 02:00:53,970
It's fine.

2684
02:00:54,030 --> 02:00:54,550
It's fine.

2685
02:00:54,790 --> 02:00:55,670
It's fine.

2686
02:00:55,830 --> 02:00:57,070
We're so safe.

2687
02:00:57,210 --> 02:00:58,210
We're so safe.

2688
02:00:58,330 --> 02:00:59,410
We're so safe.

2689
02:00:59,710 --> 02:01:00,850
Like, what is he gonna do?

2690
02:01:00,990 --> 02:01:01,530

Look at that.

2694
02:01:03,130 --> 02:01:03,430
Look at that.

2695
02:01:03,470 --> 02:01:04,230
Nothing to worry about.

2696
02:01:04,550 --> 02:01:05,610
Nothing to worry about.

2697
02:01:06,090 --> 02:01:07,790
If there was a zombie apocalypse...

2698
02:01:11,930 --> 02:01:15,630
I would have saved your life if there was a zombie apocalypse.

2699
02:01:15,890 --> 02:01:16,870
That's all I'm saying.

2700
02:01:20,470 --> 02:01:21,390
Wait, what?

2701
02:01:23,610 --> 02:01:25,330
Oh, we're supposed to push the can.

2702
02:01:25,750 --> 02:01:26,050
Go.

2703
02:01:26,670 --> 02:01:27,950
Sacrifice yourself for our love.

Push the can.

2705
02:01:34,950 --> 02:01:35,470
Push the can.

2708
02:01:43,050 --> 02:01:43,730
All right.

2709
02:01:45,510 --> 02:01:47,230
Now what do I do?

2710
02:01:52,350 --> 02:01:54,310
What the fuck do I do?

2711
02:01:57,630 --> 02:01:59,390
Wait, wait, wait.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2715
02:02:02,890 --> 02:02:03,930
You have to push the grass.

2716
02:02:04,570 --> 02:02:05,590
You have to push it so I can...

2717
02:02:08,470 --> 02:02:09,470
Are you pushing it?

2718
02:02:10,530 --> 02:02:11,790
Go to the can now.

2719
02:02:11,890 --> 02:02:12,870

2805
02:11:10,520 --> 02:11:12,380

Yeah?

2814
02:11:59,800 --> 02:12:01,300
I know what to do.

2815
02:12:01,300 --> 02:12:01,960
I think...

2816
02:12:01,960 --> 02:12:02,520
Get up here.

2817
02:12:02,600 --> 02:12:02,960
Get up here.

2818
02:12:03,040 --> 02:12:03,440
Get up here.

2819
02:12:03,540 --> 02:12:03,980
Get up here.

2820
02:12:05,280 --> 02:12:06,080
Get up here.

2821
02:12:06,600 --> 02:12:07,480
No, you get up here.

2822
02:12:09,800 --> 02:12:10,840
You get up here.

2823
02:12:15,420 --> 02:12:16,820
You know what I think it is?

2824
02:12:16,920 --> 02:12:17,360
Watch this.

2825
02:12:17,460 --> 02:12:17,740
Stay here.

2826
02:12:17,820 --> 02:12:18,280
Stay here.

2827
02:12:27,650 --> 02:12:28,730
Gumi, what do you want to say?

2828
02:12:29,170 --> 02:12:29,490
Gumi?

2829
02:12:30,470 --> 02:12:31,410
Gumi, do you want to say anything?

2830
02:12:32,230 --> 02:12:33,010
Why don't you say something?

2831
02:12:33,230 --> 02:12:33,870
Do you want to say anything?

2832
02:12:34,690 --> 02:12:35,010
No.

2833
02:12:35,310 --> 02:12:36,450
Do you want to say anything, Gumi?

2834
02:12:37,330 --> 02:12:40,910
Do you want to say anything when you lived multiple times over that stupid yo-yo?

2835
02:12:41,630 --> 02:12:43,470
I saved us with that.

2836
02:12:43,610 --> 02:12:44,290
I...

2837
02:12:44,290 --> 02:12:46,650
I don't think you did.

2838
02:12:46,950 --> 02:12:50,050
I problem solved that for us, Gumi.

2839
02:12:50,430 --> 02:12:53,910
Somebody had to think of something and...

2840
02:12:54,470 --> 02:12:56,650
You told me not to say anything.

2841
02:12:56,650 --> 02:13:07,830
I thought, you know, all I'm saying is that somebody had to think of something and I didn't see any ideas coming from this other person in my game.

2842
02:13:16,770 --> 02:13:19,370
And just like that, you can solve a lot of puzzles.

2843
02:13:21,050 --> 02:13:21,850
Let me untie that.

2844
02:13:21,870 --> 02:13:24,610
This is a team game, Gumi.

2845
02:13:25,130 --> 02:13:25,570
Go on.

2846
02:13:25,730 --> 02:13:27,990
This is a team game.

2847
02:13:28,270 --> 02:13:28,810
Go on.

2848
02:13:29,570 --> 02:13:30,930
Like... Oh, look at that.

2849
02:13:31,050 --> 02:13:32,070
Look, guess who solved it?

2850
02:13:32,550 --> 02:13:32,970
Wow.

2851
02:13:33,150 --> 02:13:33,990
Okay, go on.

2852
02:13:34,590 --> 02:13:34,990
Wow.

2853
02:13:37,070 --> 02:13:38,050
Guess who solved this?

2854
02:13:38,550 --> 02:13:41,330
No, guess who's very mature about all of this?

2855
02:13:41,810 --> 02:13:42,230
You know?

2856
02:13:42,370 --> 02:13:42,570
Go on.

2857
02:13:42,830 --> 02:13:44,010
Push the fucking brick.

2858
02:13:44,190 --> 02:13:44,770
Push the brick.

2859
02:13:46,330 --> 02:13:47,550
I thought you could do it all.

2860
02:13:49,010 --> 02:13:50,250
No, you don't need to push the brick.

2861
02:13:50,290 --> 02:13:51,070
Just go on the bridge.

2862
02:13:51,150 --> 02:13:51,750
Go on the bridge.

2863
02:13:52,550 --> 02:13:52,870
Alright.

2864
02:13:54,010 --> 02:13:54,850
There you go.

2865
02:13:58,230 --> 02:13:58,810
There you go.

2866
02:13:58,850 --> 02:14:00,290
That wasn't so difficult, was it?

2867
02:14:04,310 --> 02:14:06,630
And then we go underneath here.

2868
02:14:08,470 --> 02:14:08,830
Mhm.

2869
02:14:17,530 --> 02:14:18,190
Go on the other side.

2870
02:14:18,270 --> 02:14:18,930
Go on the other side.

2871
02:14:19,030 --> 02:14:19,570
Go on the other side.

2872
02:14:19,610 --> 02:14:20,550
Other side of the plank.

2873
02:14:20,670 --> 02:14:21,530
Other side of the plank.

2874
02:14:23,710 --> 02:14:24,450
No, no, no.

2875
02:14:24,550 --> 02:14:25,350
Jump on...

2876
02:14:26,070 --> 02:14:27,810
Jump on the other side of that plank.

2877
02:14:27,870 --> 02:14:28,310
Right there.

2878
02:14:28,810 --> 02:14:29,030
Jump.

2879
02:14:29,170 --> 02:14:29,390
Jump.

2880
02:14:30,750 --> 02:14:31,030
Huh.

2881
02:14:31,830 --> 02:14:32,990
You need the brick.

2882
02:14:33,790 --> 02:14:35,290
If you wanted a hint, that is.

2883
02:14:41,550 --> 02:14:42,310
Alright, do it.

2884
02:14:43,030 --> 02:14:43,510
Do it.

2885
02:14:44,290 --> 02:14:45,050
No, no, no, no!

2886
02:14:45,410 --> 02:14:48,870
No, no, no, Mrs. Smartass.

2887
02:14:48,950 --> 02:14:49,350
You do it.

2888
02:14:50,890 --> 02:14:51,910
Mrs. Smartass, you do it.

2889
02:14:51,990 --> 02:14:53,370
No, no, no.

2890
02:14:54,070 --> 02:14:54,970
You are so fucking smart.

2891
02:14:55,170 --> 02:14:55,710
No, do it.

2892
02:14:56,590 --> 02:14:58,010
I need the fucking brick!

2893
02:14:59,510 --> 02:15:00,750
You clearly know what it is.

2894
02:15:00,850 --> 02:15:01,510
You fucking do it.

2895
02:15:17,870 --> 02:15:18,210
Oh!

2896
02:15:18,210 --> 02:15:19,170
You are going to sniffle.

2897
02:15:19,170 --> 02:15:19,970
You're gonna sniffle.

2898
02:15:20,130 --> 02:15:20,970
You're gonna sniffle.

2899
02:15:21,150 --> 02:15:24,070
After you make me- making me do all the work, you're gonna sniffle right now.

2900
02:15:24,310 --> 02:15:28,290
You're gonna- you're gonna- Yeah?

2901
02:15:31,870 --> 02:15:32,230
Yeah?

2902
02:15:32,570 --> 02:15:35,030
Oh, why didn't you push that brake when I told you to?

2903
02:15:35,450 --> 02:15:35,710
Huh?

2904
02:15:36,370 --> 02:15:40,150
Why- oh, somebody didn't push that brake when I said, can you please push that brake?

2905
02:15:40,450 --> 02:15:40,470
Oh.

2906
02:15:40,730 --> 02:15:41,250
My character's pointing?

2907
02:15:41,410 --> 02:15:42,150
My character's pointing?

2908
02:15:42,370 --> 02:15:43,910
Yeah, yeah, I'm seeing- I'm seeing it.

2909
02:15:43,970 --> 02:15:44,530
I'm seeing it.

2910
02:15:44,590 --> 02:15:47,530
Somebody decided not to, you know, push that- push that for me.

2911
02:15:47,690 --> 02:15:50,690
Well, I feel like earlier, I heard someone say, we don't need the brake, just jump on it.

2912
02:15:50,690 --> 02:15:52,190
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2913
02:15:52,190 --> 02:15:56,330
At first, I was like- No, and then I was like, can you please push that, but then you didn't push it.

2914
02:15:56,370 --> 02:15:57,450
So I was just like, you know, fuck it.

2915
02:15:57,470 --> 02:15:57,950
We don't need it.

2916
02:15:57,970 --> 02:15:58,570
We don't need it.

2917
02:15:58,910 --> 02:15:59,650
We don't need it.

2918
02:15:59,690 --> 02:16:00,890
You know, we don't need it.

2919
02:16:00,950 --> 02:16:01,530
Oh, yeah.

2920
02:16:02,070 --> 02:16:02,730
Oh, yeah.

2921
02:16:04,170 --> 02:16:05,410
Okay, here we go.

2922
02:16:10,010 --> 02:16:16,290
If I could fucking push this brake into you right now- I'm just gonna leave.

2923
02:16:16,570 --> 02:16:18,190
I'm just gonna- I'm gonna quit this collab right now.

2924
02:16:18,190 --> 02:16:21,350
We're never gonna solve our marriage, and we'll never finish this game.

2925
02:16:21,430 --> 02:16:21,910
Is that what you want?

2926
02:16:21,990 --> 02:16:22,670
Is this what you want?

2927
02:16:22,790 --> 02:16:23,530
Is this what you want?

2928
02:16:23,930 --> 02:16:24,110
Is this-

2929
02:16:36,990 --> 02:16:38,510
I'll turn this car around.

2930
02:16:38,690 --> 02:16:43,130
I'll fucking turn this car- I'll turn this car around.

2931
02:16:43,230 --> 02:16:44,830
I'll actually- I'll turn this car around.

2932
02:16:45,210 --> 02:16:53,950
I'll- I need you to also do- I need you to fucking- Ty, we need two strings.

2933
02:16:54,030 --> 02:16:55,070
We need two strings.

2934
02:16:55,230 --> 02:16:57,270
We need two strings.

2935
02:16:57,410 --> 02:16:59,210
We need two strings.

2936
02:17:03,210 --> 02:17:04,670
Give me a sec.

2937
02:17:05,470 --> 02:17:07,490
It's not fully tied!

2938
02:17:08,430 --> 02:17:09,110
Okay, fine.

2939
02:17:09,170 --> 02:17:09,350
Fine.

2940
02:17:09,570 --> 02:17:10,490
You're so smart.

2941
02:17:10,610 --> 02:17:10,850
I'm fine.

2942
02:17:10,970 --> 02:17:11,130
Fine.

2943
02:17:12,810 --> 02:17:14,430
You were not clapping.

2944
02:17:14,650 --> 02:17:16,970
You were not- no, you were not.

2945
02:17:17,050 --> 02:17:18,190
You were not clapping.

2946
02:17:18,190 --> 02:17:20,870
You were- you were not clapping.

2947
02:17:21,450 --> 02:17:23,850
You were actually not clapping.

2948
02:17:24,230 --> 02:17:26,050
You fucking bitch.

2949
02:17:26,450 --> 02:17:27,630
You were not clapping.

2950
02:17:27,730 --> 02:17:28,270
You were not.

2951
02:17:28,790 --> 02:17:30,050
You were not clapping.

2952
02:17:30,230 --> 02:17:31,230
You were not clapping.

2953
02:17:31,350 --> 02:17:32,070
You were not.

2954
02:17:32,210 --> 02:17:34,290
You were actually not clapping.

2955
02:17:42,510 --> 02:17:43,330
Do it.

2956
02:17:45,770 --> 02:17:46,650
Do it.

2957
02:17:47,470 --> 02:17:47,790
Come on.

2958
02:17:51,320 --> 02:17:51,900
Come on.

2959
02:17:52,200 --> 02:17:52,960
What's going on?

2960
02:17:55,480 --> 02:17:56,040
Do it!

2961
02:17:56,740 --> 02:17:57,600
Oh, what happened?

2962
02:17:57,680 --> 02:17:58,200
What's going on?

2963
02:17:59,020 --> 02:17:59,380
Huh?

2964
02:17:59,760 --> 02:18:01,540
I don't know, why didn't you do it the first time?

2965
02:18:04,180 --> 02:18:04,900
Because I...

2966
02:18:05,820 --> 02:18:08,600
I decided to let you do it because you're so good at it, you know?

2967
02:18:09,500 --> 02:18:10,780
Yeah, I am good at it.

2968
02:18:11,520 --> 02:18:12,760
Oh, now you accept compliments.

2969
02:18:12,940 --> 02:18:13,220
Wow.

2970
02:18:13,520 --> 02:18:14,540
That's actually...

2971
02:18:14,540 --> 02:18:15,680
First time for everything.

2972
02:18:26,760 --> 02:18:27,540
Oh, hey.

2973
02:18:28,220 --> 02:18:28,940
Are you okay there?

2974
02:18:30,880 --> 02:18:31,740
What if you tie it?

2975
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:34,060
What do

2976
02:18:37,250 --> 02:18:38,670
you mean?

2977
02:18:39,770 --> 02:18:41,010
What are you trying to do?

2978
02:18:41,790 --> 02:18:42,710
I'm gonna tie it.

2979
02:18:42,890 --> 02:18:43,230
Why?

2980
02:18:44,150 --> 02:18:44,630
Why?

2981
02:18:45,590 --> 02:18:46,450
I'm gonna tie it.

2982
02:18:48,070 --> 02:18:49,250
Please, I'm...

2983
02:18:49,890 --> 02:18:50,890
Please start swinging.

2984
02:18:51,090 --> 02:18:52,150
Please start swinging.

2985
02:18:52,890 --> 02:18:53,530
I...

2986
02:18:54,030 --> 02:18:55,390
Hey, why'd you let go?

2987
02:18:56,530 --> 02:18:57,630
I don't know.

2988
02:18:58,670 --> 02:19:00,030
Why did you...

2989
02:19:00,030 --> 02:19:01,890
Why did you stop loving me?

2990
02:19:17,340 --> 02:19:18,740
I'm so good at it.

2991
02:19:41,070 --> 02:19:43,670
What are you supposed to do?

2992
02:19:45,890 --> 02:19:47,270
Dude, I tied it.

2993
02:19:47,990 --> 02:19:50,710
Maybe you're supposed to tie the other end.

2994
02:19:53,290 --> 02:19:54,590
Okay, here we go.

2995
02:20:00,960 --> 02:20:02,760
Are you supposed to tie that one?

2996
02:20:07,080 --> 02:20:07,900
Can you even sleep?

2997
02:20:08,220 --> 02:20:10,400
Well, if you want to sleep, you have to come over here.

2998
02:20:11,060 --> 02:20:11,320
What?

2999
02:20:11,600 --> 02:20:12,140
I can't.

3000
02:20:12,140 --> 02:20:14,080
I can't move because it's like at the very end.

3001
02:20:14,100 --> 02:20:14,680
Are you out of yarn?

3002
02:20:15,140 --> 02:20:15,480
Yeah.

3003
02:20:16,090 --> 02:20:16,340
Here.

3004
02:20:19,430 --> 02:20:20,390
What the...

3005
02:20:20,390 --> 02:20:21,250
I have to untie.

3006
02:20:22,410 --> 02:20:22,970
Okay, come over.

3007
02:20:23,610 --> 02:20:24,110
Okay.

3008
02:20:25,070 --> 02:20:25,570
Oops.

3009
02:20:26,030 --> 02:20:26,750
The fuck?

3010
02:20:26,830 --> 02:20:27,340
Why did it...

3011
02:20:28,230 --> 02:20:28,850
All right.

3012
02:20:34,170 --> 02:20:35,310
Why do I have to come over?

3013
02:20:35,950 --> 02:20:36,690
No, we can't.

3014
02:20:36,710 --> 02:20:37,200
We have to...

3015
02:20:37,770 --> 02:20:38,750
Oh, we can.

3016
02:20:38,830 --> 02:20:39,110
Oh.

3017
02:20:40,250 --> 02:20:41,410
Why did we tie it?

3018
02:20:43,150 --> 02:20:44,150
Oh, okay.

3019
02:20:53,260 --> 02:20:55,660
And so, we wasted like five...

3020
02:20:55,660 --> 02:20:57,240
We wasted five minutes just...

3021
02:20:57,240 --> 02:20:58,540
Just for that.

3022
02:20:59,900 --> 02:21:01,560
Yeah, isn't life beautiful?

3023
02:21:01,780 --> 02:21:03,980
We could have seen the longest bridge in Unravel 2.

3024
02:21:12,220 --> 02:21:12,860
Swing.

3025
02:21:13,480 --> 02:21:15,260
All right.

3026
02:21:15,740 --> 02:21:16,380
Swing.

3027
02:21:17,420 --> 02:21:18,020
That's fine.

3028
02:21:19,520 --> 02:21:21,540
My little yarn arms are tired.

3029
02:21:23,060 --> 02:21:25,500
I sense something dangerous approaching us.

3030
02:21:25,620 --> 02:21:27,840
No, there's nothing dangerous here.

3031
02:21:28,240 --> 02:21:29,340
Gotta be a man.

3032
02:21:30,520 --> 02:21:31,220
What's up?

3033
02:21:31,320 --> 02:21:32,340
What happened to you?

3034
02:21:32,720 --> 02:21:33,840
Who hurt you?

3035
02:21:35,140 --> 02:21:35,700
Who...

3036
02:21:35,700 --> 02:21:36,620
It's like...

3037
02:21:36,620 --> 02:21:37,740
I'll let you take a guess.

3038
02:21:37,860 --> 02:21:39,300
I know I'm not a man, like...

3039
02:21:43,120 --> 02:21:44,520
Like, who hurt you?

3040
02:21:46,120 --> 02:21:47,620
Are you okay?

3041
02:21:53,220 --> 02:21:55,220
I wanna play Dead Log.

3042
02:21:56,320 --> 02:21:57,740
You suggested this.

3043
02:21:58,580 --> 02:22:00,100
You suggested this game.

3044
02:22:00,480 --> 02:22:01,940
You cannot say that.

3045
02:22:02,020 --> 02:22:03,800
You suggested this game.

3046
02:22:06,740 --> 02:22:07,800
I think it was like...

3047
02:22:07,800 --> 02:22:08,640
I put this here.

3048
02:22:10,540 --> 02:22:11,240
Oh, okay.

3049
02:22:12,400 --> 02:22:13,500
Look, we did it.

3050
02:22:13,640 --> 02:22:14,380
We're a team.

3051
02:22:15,920 --> 02:22:16,760
Get over here.

3052
02:22:16,880 --> 02:22:17,340
Get over here.

3053
02:22:17,420 --> 02:22:18,140
Get over here.

3054
02:22:19,040 --> 02:22:19,520
Okay.

3055
02:22:19,800 --> 02:22:20,280
Look, look.

3056
02:22:20,280 --> 02:22:23,000
We were so behind that the little fucking spark was like...

3057
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:23,760
Are you guys good?

3058
02:22:24,080 --> 02:22:24,620
Like...

3059
02:22:25,240 --> 02:22:27,200
Even the spark was like...

3060
02:22:27,200 --> 02:22:27,840
Hey, look.

3061
02:22:27,920 --> 02:22:29,240
We're wasting time here.

3062
02:22:34,310 --> 02:22:34,870
Okay.

3063
02:22:35,850 --> 02:22:36,410
Nice.

3064
02:22:40,140 --> 02:22:41,680
Like here, isn't it?

3065
02:22:41,880 --> 02:22:43,080
Wait, what's this for then?

3066
02:22:44,640 --> 02:22:45,620
What's this for?

3067
02:22:51,220 --> 02:22:51,980
You okay?

3068
02:22:53,120 --> 02:22:54,360
You okay there?

3069
02:22:56,460 --> 02:22:57,260
You okay?

3070
02:22:57,420 --> 02:22:58,440
Look, it's just...

3071
02:22:58,440 --> 02:22:59,640
Look, just climb up.

3072
02:22:59,660 --> 02:23:01,040
Just climb up.

3073
02:23:01,040 --> 02:23:01,940
Gumi, just...

3074
02:23:02,700 --> 02:23:03,540
Just climb up.

3075
02:23:06,060 --> 02:23:06,580
Oh.

3076
02:23:06,860 --> 02:23:07,900
No, don't go down.

3077
02:23:08,200 --> 02:23:09,020
Don't go down.

3078
02:23:09,120 --> 02:23:11,060
I was supposed to swing from that.

3079
02:23:11,680 --> 02:23:12,020
All right.

3080
02:23:12,380 --> 02:23:12,640
Go.

3081
02:23:15,160 --> 02:23:15,680
Swing.

3082
02:23:16,440 --> 02:23:17,080
There you go.

3083
02:23:20,240 --> 02:23:21,260
There you go.

3084
02:23:21,360 --> 02:23:22,980
Oh, you did it!

3085
02:23:23,400 --> 02:23:25,080
Oh my God, I'm so...

3086
02:23:25,080 --> 02:23:26,400
No, no, no, no, no!

3087
02:23:26,500 --> 02:23:27,740
I'm trying to climb up!

3088
02:23:29,660 --> 02:23:30,460
No, no, no!

3089
02:23:30,700 --> 02:23:32,460
Don't do anything stupid here!

3090
02:23:34,100 --> 02:23:36,020
No, you love the parkour!

3091
02:23:36,320 --> 02:23:38,020
You literally watch parkour...

3092
02:23:38,020 --> 02:23:41,520
She watched the entire parkour civilization video, by the way.

3093
02:23:41,820 --> 02:23:42,640
When the only...

3094
02:23:42,640 --> 02:23:46,340
When the only like fun parts was literally the beef and chicken part.

3095
02:23:46,420 --> 02:23:48,160
Like, then the rest was just whatever.

3096
02:23:49,880 --> 02:23:50,440
Like...

3097
02:23:51,320 --> 02:23:54,800
She literally watched the entire two of them.

3098
02:23:57,040 --> 02:23:58,180
Wait, what's this?

3099
02:24:02,060 --> 02:24:03,340
Gotta pull this up.

3100
02:24:03,420 --> 02:24:03,740
Oh!

3101
02:24:04,460 --> 02:24:04,900
Okay.

3102
02:24:06,680 --> 02:24:08,460
And then we gotta push this here.

3103
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:10,440
Oh, I gotta bring you up a little bit.

3104
02:24:10,560 --> 02:24:10,740
Gumi?

3105
02:24:11,020 --> 02:24:12,240
Gumi, what are you doing?

3106
02:24:15,930 --> 02:24:17,410
Gumi, why did you do that?

3107
02:24:18,170 --> 02:24:19,730
I didn't like our ropes being tangled.

3108
02:24:21,490 --> 02:24:21,930
That's...

3109
02:24:21,930 --> 02:24:22,990
That's the whole point.

3110
02:24:23,830 --> 02:24:24,950
I don't like it.

3111
02:24:25,210 --> 02:24:26,070
Gumi, that was...

3112
02:24:26,650 --> 02:24:27,130
I'm gonna...

3113
02:24:27,130 --> 02:24:27,710
I'm gonna...

3114
02:24:27,710 --> 02:24:29,810
I'm gonna push you up a little bit on the square.

3115
02:24:30,230 --> 02:24:31,050
That was...

3116
02:24:31,050 --> 02:24:32,250
That was the entire point, Gumi.

3117
02:24:32,370 --> 02:24:33,570
Like, why did you...

3118
02:24:33,650 --> 02:24:34,950
Why did you do that?

3119
02:24:35,830 --> 02:24:36,350
Why?

3120
02:24:38,550 --> 02:24:39,350
You know what?

3121
02:24:39,430 --> 02:24:39,830
I'm just...

3122
02:24:40,810 --> 02:24:42,030
You get... Everybody gets one.

3123
02:24:42,250 --> 02:24:43,230
Everybody gets one.

3124
02:24:43,730 --> 02:24:45,110
Some people get more than one.

3125
02:24:45,270 --> 02:24:46,430
And like, that's just love.

3126
02:24:47,310 --> 02:24:49,810
If somebody still is trying...

3127
02:24:51,390 --> 02:24:51,910
What?

3128
02:24:52,710 --> 02:24:53,910
No, you have to...

3129
02:24:53,910 --> 02:24:55,470
You push the other...

3130
02:24:56,770 --> 02:24:57,290
You...

3131
02:24:59,640 --> 02:25:00,280
Push it.

3132
02:25:00,460 --> 02:25:00,860
Push it.

3133
02:25:01,580 --> 02:25:02,100
You...

3134
02:25:07,600 --> 02:25:08,120
Okay.

3135
02:25:10,220 --> 02:25:11,400
All right, let's do that again.

3136
02:25:13,640 --> 02:25:14,300
All right.

3137
02:25:15,820 --> 02:25:16,220
Okay.

3138
02:25:16,440 --> 02:25:17,820
You see where I'm going with this?

3139
02:25:17,880 --> 02:25:18,680
You push it up.

3140
02:25:19,600 --> 02:25:20,560
You push it up.

3141
02:25:20,620 --> 02:25:20,960
Yes.

3142
02:25:21,300 --> 02:25:21,640
Good.

3143
02:25:22,320 --> 02:25:22,720
Good.

3144
02:25:24,120 --> 02:25:24,520
Good.

3145
02:25:24,920 --> 02:25:26,020
No, no, keep going.

3146
02:25:26,220 --> 02:25:26,840
Keep going.

3147
02:25:27,620 --> 02:25:28,160
Keep going.

3148
02:25:29,340 --> 02:25:30,100
Keep going.

3149
02:25:30,400 --> 02:25:30,980
Keep going.

3150
02:25:32,140 --> 02:25:32,400
Oh.

3151
02:25:33,380 --> 02:25:34,640
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3152
02:25:34,640 --> 02:25:34,880
Push it.

3153
02:25:34,940 --> 02:25:35,420
Don't push it up.

3154
02:25:35,480 --> 02:25:35,880
Don't push it.

3155
02:25:35,960 --> 02:25:36,120
Oh.

3156
02:25:36,800 --> 02:25:37,200
Okay.

3157
02:25:42,500 --> 02:25:43,380
All right.

3158
02:25:44,620 --> 02:25:46,500
Okay, let's do this again.

3159
02:25:50,680 --> 02:25:52,480
I'm very patient with you.

3160
02:25:53,700 --> 02:25:54,960
For the kids.

3161
02:25:57,600 --> 02:25:58,540
Keep pushing.

3162
02:25:58,720 --> 02:25:59,160
Keep pushing.

3163
02:25:59,380 --> 02:25:59,620
Yeah.

3164
02:26:00,560 --> 02:26:01,660
Yeah, are you doing it?

3165
02:26:03,440 --> 02:26:05,000
Yeah, you're doing it.

3166
02:26:05,160 --> 02:26:05,540
Good.

3167
02:26:06,040 --> 02:26:06,520
Good.

3168
02:26:07,100 --> 02:26:07,700
Good.

3169
02:26:08,640 --> 02:26:09,380
There, there.

3170
02:26:09,480 --> 02:26:10,880
Y'all, you see what I did there?

3171
02:26:11,260 --> 02:26:12,880
You see what I did there?

3172
02:26:13,080 --> 02:26:14,740
You see what we could have done in the first time?

3173
02:26:14,760 --> 02:26:15,820
Did we have to untangle our rope?

3174
02:26:16,140 --> 02:26:17,140
No, no, no.

3175
02:26:17,220 --> 02:26:17,740
What are you talking?

3176
02:26:17,840 --> 02:26:19,380
You see what we did the first time?

3177
02:26:19,760 --> 02:26:20,920
No, you see...

3178
02:26:20,920 --> 02:26:21,880
Let's untangle our rope.

3179
02:26:22,460 --> 02:26:22,960
Go down.

3180
02:26:23,140 --> 02:26:23,420
Go under.

3181
02:26:30,600 --> 02:26:32,300
All right, now you know what to do, right?

3182
02:26:32,500 --> 02:26:33,240
Now you...

3183
02:26:33,240 --> 02:26:34,060
Okay, I'll push it.

3184
02:26:34,260 --> 02:26:35,280
No, no, no, no.

3185
02:26:35,340 --> 02:26:35,900
All right, all right.

3186
02:26:35,900 --> 02:26:36,640
No, no, not yet.

3187
02:26:36,640 --> 02:26:37,560
Not yet, not yet.

3188
02:26:37,560 --> 02:26:38,100
Go back.

3189
02:26:38,180 --> 02:26:38,780
Go back.

3190
02:26:38,920 --> 02:26:39,620
There you go.

3191
02:26:40,080 --> 02:26:40,680
There we go.

3192
02:26:40,740 --> 02:26:41,880
Now push it.

3193
02:26:41,980 --> 02:26:42,220
Yeah.

3194
02:26:42,220 --> 02:26:46,300
Yeah, there we go.

3195
02:26:46,500 --> 02:26:47,040
There we go.

3196
02:26:47,140 --> 02:26:47,600
And then...

3197
02:26:49,600 --> 02:26:51,360
You did not need to...

3198
02:26:51,360 --> 02:26:51,740
Okay.

3199
02:26:53,360 --> 02:26:55,080
You didn't need to tangle it.

3200
02:26:55,760 --> 02:26:57,500
You didn't need to tangle it.

3201
02:26:57,800 --> 02:27:00,600
Yeah, that's what I said earlier, but you said no.

3202
02:27:02,080 --> 02:27:03,180
That's what you wanted.

3203
02:27:03,740 --> 02:27:05,060
No, no.

3204
02:27:05,320 --> 02:27:06,300
No, that's not it.

3205
02:27:06,420 --> 02:27:07,160
No, no.

3206
02:27:07,700 --> 02:27:07,920
Yeah.

3207
02:27:08,140 --> 02:27:08,940
No, no, Kumi.

3208
02:27:09,160 --> 02:27:09,960
Kumi, Kumi.

3209
02:27:10,180 --> 02:27:10,860
No, that's not...

3210
02:27:10,860 --> 02:27:11,800
Earlier, you said...

3211
02:27:11,800 --> 02:27:11,820
No.

3212
02:27:11,820 --> 02:27:13,340
Exactly like this.

3213
02:27:13,340 --> 02:27:14,760
No, no, no, Kumi.

3214
02:27:14,840 --> 02:27:15,580
I did not, Kumi.

3215
02:27:15,600 --> 02:27:17,240
I was like, oh, no, I want to untangle it.

3216
02:27:17,480 --> 02:27:17,600
Kumi.

3217
02:27:17,860 --> 02:27:19,580
And you're like, okay, you don't have to.

3218
02:27:19,740 --> 02:27:22,620
No, no, Kumi, Kumi, Kumi, Kumi.

3219
02:27:25,840 --> 02:27:27,620
We figured out the solution.

3220
02:27:27,980 --> 02:27:29,900
You don't need to do this, Kumi.

3221
02:27:30,980 --> 02:27:35,780
I just want to show you that I wanted to untangle it and you yelled at me earlier.

3222
02:27:37,180 --> 02:27:40,060
No, because you were doing it wrong, Kumi.

3223
02:27:40,060 --> 02:27:43,040
That's not because I yelled at you because you were...

3224
02:27:43,040 --> 02:27:44,980
Because you had the right solution.

3225
02:27:45,120 --> 02:27:48,280
I yelled at you because you were doing it wrong.

3226
02:27:55,600 --> 02:27:58,020
Come on, we're a team here.

3227
02:28:02,420 --> 02:28:03,620
At home?

3228
02:28:04,560 --> 02:28:05,200
One day?

3229
02:28:08,600 --> 02:28:09,060
Yeah.

3230
02:28:09,400 --> 02:28:09,720
No, that's insane.

3231
02:28:10,180 --> 02:28:11,320
No, no, no.

3232
02:28:12,200 --> 02:28:14,160
Clearly, you have a lot on your mind.

3233
02:28:14,480 --> 02:28:15,620
No, I mustn't.

3234
02:28:15,740 --> 02:28:16,540
All right, go.

3235
02:28:21,840 --> 02:28:23,140
Do the swing!

3236
02:28:24,100 --> 02:28:25,120
Oh, my God.

3237
02:28:33,050 --> 02:28:34,070
Oh, you missed.

3238
02:28:36,590 --> 02:28:37,790
Oh, you missed again.

3239
02:28:42,340 --> 02:28:43,080
There you go.

3240
02:28:43,120 --> 02:28:43,320
See?

3241
02:28:43,460 --> 02:28:44,500
Eventually, you get there.

3242
02:28:53,700 --> 02:28:55,840
This is a good time to tap out.

3243
02:28:56,740 --> 02:28:58,280
No, don't hug me.

3244
02:29:01,180 --> 02:29:02,720
No, no.

3245
02:29:08,820 --> 02:29:10,900
No, we're past that point.

3246
02:29:11,860 --> 02:29:13,100
You stupid bitch!

3247
02:29:13,180 --> 02:29:14,040
I just remembered something.

3248
02:29:14,640 --> 02:29:16,420
You never come back to me.

3249
02:29:16,940 --> 02:29:17,400
But what?

3250
02:29:21,800 --> 02:29:22,040
What?

3251
02:29:22,220 --> 02:29:23,020
I'm confused.

3252
02:29:26,460 --> 02:29:27,340
I'm confused.

3253
02:29:32,600 --> 02:29:33,860
Wait, what time is it?

3254
02:29:33,940 --> 02:29:34,140
I forgot.

3255
02:29:34,500 --> 02:29:35,880
Guys, finish this game first!

3256
02:29:36,280 --> 02:29:38,740
We need to finish this game first!

3257
02:29:38,980 --> 02:29:39,220
Get off!

3258
02:29:39,240 --> 02:29:40,980
It says input is temporary in the game mode!

3259
02:29:41,400 --> 02:29:42,240
Oh, my God.

3260
02:29:42,540 --> 02:29:43,760
Oh, my God.

3261
02:29:44,280 --> 02:29:44,980
Get over here.

3262
02:29:45,080 --> 02:29:45,320
Get it.

3263
02:29:45,540 --> 02:29:46,100
Yo, this way.

3264
02:29:46,160 --> 02:29:46,700
It's down here.

3265
02:29:46,800 --> 02:29:47,120
It's down.

3266
02:29:50,260 --> 02:29:51,700
All right, here we go.

3267
02:29:52,340 --> 02:29:54,100
Now, we go downstairs.

3268
02:29:55,320 --> 02:29:57,160
Wait, there's a tie here.

3269
02:30:00,460 --> 02:30:00,880
Yeah?

3270
02:30:02,840 --> 02:30:03,740
Are you- Are you okay?

3271
02:30:04,120 --> 02:30:05,960
Are you- Why'd you do that?

3272
02:30:06,240 --> 02:30:06,740
Are you okay?

3273
02:30:06,880 --> 02:30:08,940
We have to do that again because we fucked it up.

3274
02:30:09,040 --> 02:30:10,460
We have to do that again now.

3275
02:30:15,150 --> 02:30:16,430
Now, we got it.

3276
02:30:16,490 --> 02:30:16,750
Okay.

3277
02:30:21,030 --> 02:30:22,550
All right, let's do that again.

3278
02:30:23,190 --> 02:30:26,570
We were supposed to do- We were supposed to be over there.

3279
02:30:26,690 --> 02:30:27,230
Yeah, yeah.

3280
02:30:27,270 --> 02:30:29,510
You're supposed to save my life, you know?

3281
02:30:29,670 --> 02:30:33,090
Like, we're supposed to- Yeah, yeah.

3282
02:30:33,110 --> 02:30:33,790
Oh, thanks.

3283
02:30:36,870 --> 02:30:38,850
I'm literally holding down the button.

3284
02:30:39,390 --> 02:30:41,250
All right, how about I hold it, you know?

3285
02:30:41,390 --> 02:30:41,790
How about...

3286
02:30:46,800 --> 02:30:47,260
Yeah?

3287
02:30:53,080 --> 02:30:54,000
There we go.

3288
02:30:56,320 --> 02:30:57,840
Clearly, clearly somebody's here.

3289
02:30:57,840 --> 02:30:58,880
Clearly, someone didn't jump.

3290
02:30:58,880 --> 02:31:02,900
No, clearly somebody here knows how to save another person's life.

3291
02:31:03,880 --> 02:31:07,980
Clearly, someone didn't jump up and save themselves when I was holding down the button the entire time.

3292
02:31:08,540 --> 02:31:12,760
Someone just didn't have their own hands and wanted me to do all the work, but it's okay.

3293
02:31:12,960 --> 02:31:13,900
Like, sometimes it's okay.

3294
02:31:14,100 --> 02:31:15,420
Like, I don't mind doing all the work sometimes.

3295
02:31:15,560 --> 02:31:16,360
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3296
02:31:16,360 --> 02:31:17,100
You don't mind?

3297
02:31:17,240 --> 02:31:17,800
You don't mind?

3298
02:31:17,920 --> 02:31:18,120
Okay.

3299
02:31:18,680 --> 02:31:18,940
Yeah.

3300
02:31:19,200 --> 02:31:20,200
No, no, no, no, no.

3301
02:31:20,240 --> 02:31:21,120
You said you don't mind.

3302
02:31:21,240 --> 02:31:22,420
No, no, no, no, no.

3303
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:23,680
I said that all the time.

3304
02:31:23,840 --> 02:31:25,280
When would that be?

3305
02:31:25,500 --> 02:31:26,120
I always said sometimes.

3306
02:31:27,460 --> 02:31:28,720
You get one every hour.

3307
02:31:29,960 --> 02:31:33,060
Oh, but it's been two hours, so I should get another one.

3308
02:31:34,020 --> 02:31:34,760
No, no, no, no.

3309
02:31:34,760 --> 02:31:35,700
I think I'm done.

3310
02:31:35,800 --> 02:31:38,000
I gave a lot of freebies to you.

3311
02:31:38,300 --> 02:31:39,540
It's like charity work, if you can tell.

3312
02:31:40,560 --> 02:31:40,900
Yeah.

3313
02:31:42,480 --> 02:31:44,060
Maybe, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3314
02:31:46,620 --> 02:31:47,240
Okay, don't worry.

3315
02:31:47,320 --> 02:31:49,420
I'll hold S and up like I did earlier for you.

3316
02:31:49,720 --> 02:31:51,480
Oh, wow, you're so sweet.

3317
02:31:51,660 --> 02:31:53,740
Wow, my god, you're so sweet.

3318
02:31:54,140 --> 02:31:55,520
How does this game exist?

3319
02:31:55,740 --> 02:31:58,280
I've played more than a game that had actual divorces.

3320
02:31:59,160 --> 02:32:03,120
No, no, no.

3321
02:32:03,220 --> 02:32:03,580
You're fine.

3322
02:32:03,640 --> 02:32:04,140
You're fine, Gumi.

3323
02:32:04,280 --> 02:32:06,460
If you don't really want to work together, that's fine.

3324
02:32:06,600 --> 02:32:07,260
No, that's fine, that's fine.

3325
02:32:07,280 --> 02:32:08,600
I'll hold S and up again.

3326
02:32:10,260 --> 02:32:11,540
Okay, yeah, yeah, sure, yeah.

3327
02:32:11,700 --> 02:32:12,420
Oh, wow.

3328
02:32:12,720 --> 02:32:13,560
Thanks for holding it.

3329
02:32:14,220 --> 02:32:15,120
Hey, what happened?

3330
02:32:15,160 --> 02:32:16,100
I was holding S and up.

3331
02:32:16,320 --> 02:32:16,940
I don't know.

3332
02:32:16,980 --> 02:32:18,080
I don't know what happened there.

3333
02:32:18,300 --> 02:32:20,780
Oh, you want to learn how to do this again when you watch me do it?

3334
02:32:20,840 --> 02:32:21,740
Yeah, you want...

3335
02:32:24,360 --> 02:32:25,200
Oh, you hold it?

3336
02:32:25,260 --> 02:32:25,720
Oh, yeah.

3337
02:32:25,800 --> 02:32:25,940
Hey.

3338
02:32:26,220 --> 02:32:27,600
Yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey.

3339
02:32:31,240 --> 02:32:31,900
Go, no, go.

3340
02:32:31,980 --> 02:32:32,360
Do your swing.

3341
02:32:32,500 --> 02:32:32,900
Do your swing.

3342
02:32:33,220 --> 02:32:33,920
You're so good at it.

3343
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:34,720
Do your swing.

3344
02:32:35,040 --> 02:32:35,800
Do your swing, sweetie.

3345
02:32:35,960 --> 02:32:36,720
You're so good at it.

3346
02:32:36,980 --> 02:32:37,620
Do the roar, Shrek.

3347
02:32:37,860 --> 02:32:38,260
Do the roar.

3348
02:32:39,320 --> 02:32:40,060
Do what roar?

3349
02:32:40,340 --> 02:32:40,580
Come on.

3350
02:32:40,840 --> 02:32:41,100
Do the roar.

3351
02:32:41,100 --> 02:32:41,320
Do what?

3352
02:32:42,160 --> 02:32:42,480
Do it.

3353
02:32:42,700 --> 02:32:43,160
Do what?

3354
02:32:43,720 --> 02:32:44,080
Do the roar.

3355
02:32:44,220 --> 02:32:45,100
No, you have to give me an example.

3356
02:32:45,200 --> 02:32:46,080
I don't know what you're talking about.

3357
02:32:46,400 --> 02:32:46,840
No, no, no.

3358
02:32:46,840 --> 02:32:47,540
You have to do the roar.

3359
02:32:47,900 --> 02:32:48,940
I don't know what you're talking about.

3360
02:32:50,720 --> 02:32:51,840
Well, I guess we'll never know.

3361
02:32:53,740 --> 02:32:54,100
God.

3362
02:33:00,140 --> 02:33:01,500
Are you scared of water?

3363
02:33:03,920 --> 02:33:04,320
No.

3364
02:33:05,020 --> 02:33:05,940
Then why didn't you jump?

3365
02:33:06,020 --> 02:33:07,280
Why did you wait until I jumped?

3366
02:33:07,820 --> 02:33:08,880
I'm scared of frogs.

3367
02:33:09,140 --> 02:33:10,080
What's wrong with frogs?

3368
02:33:10,420 --> 02:33:11,240
Oh, look, that's me.

3369
02:33:11,980 --> 02:33:14,620
I don't like looking at frogs.

3370
02:33:14,740 --> 02:33:15,100
Why not?

3371
02:33:15,860 --> 02:33:19,160
I feel like I don't like animals that aren't mammals.

3372
02:33:19,200 --> 02:33:22,360
Well, to be fair, they're like extra slimy and stuff too, so...

3373
02:33:22,360 --> 02:33:23,340
Oh, wait.

3374
02:33:24,500 --> 02:33:25,520
Hey, don't die from that.

3375
02:33:25,520 --> 02:33:26,700
Wait, then what's the point?

3376
02:33:27,220 --> 02:33:30,060
No, before I went to like an Asian market with my grandma.

3377
02:33:31,700 --> 02:33:33,060
Oh, that's the point.

3378
02:33:35,180 --> 02:33:36,320
There's fishes here.

3379
02:33:36,700 --> 02:33:39,760
And she ordered a frog and then they skinned the frog alive in front of me.

3380
02:33:39,780 --> 02:33:40,380
Wait, no, don't say that.

3381
02:33:40,440 --> 02:33:41,020
Don't say that.

3382
02:33:41,060 --> 02:33:41,460
Don't say that.

3383
02:33:41,460 --> 02:33:42,120
That's just trauma.

3384
02:33:42,300 --> 02:33:42,940
That's just trauma.

3385
02:33:43,180 --> 02:33:43,720
That's just trauma.

3386
02:33:44,900 --> 02:33:45,700
That's just trauma.

3387
02:33:45,800 --> 02:33:46,500
No, don't say that.

3388
02:33:46,580 --> 02:33:46,940
Don't say that.

3389
02:33:46,940 --> 02:33:47,840
That's actually so gross.

3390
02:33:48,120 --> 02:33:49,660
I've actually dissected a frog.

3391
02:33:50,420 --> 02:33:51,620
I've dissected an iguana.

3392
02:33:52,460 --> 02:33:52,860
What?

3393
02:33:52,980 --> 02:33:53,640
In college.

3394
02:33:53,640 --> 02:33:55,360
Yeah, in college, they...

3395
02:33:55,360 --> 02:33:57,720
Because I was going to study to be a vet...

3396
02:33:58,380 --> 02:33:59,120
I'm okay.

3397
02:33:59,400 --> 02:33:59,840
A vet tech?

3398
02:34:00,260 --> 02:34:00,620
Yeah.

3399
02:34:01,660 --> 02:34:03,050
And while studying...

3400
02:34:09,660 --> 02:34:11,960
I sacrificed myself for you.

3401
02:34:15,080 --> 02:34:17,680
Okay, well, I can't do that twice.

3402
02:34:19,060 --> 02:34:21,280
Why did you jump at the right time?

3403
02:34:23,920 --> 02:34:26,080
Wait, how do we...

3404
02:34:26,080 --> 02:34:27,040
I think we have to wait.

3405
02:34:29,160 --> 02:34:30,340
Yeah, why didn't...

3406
02:34:30,340 --> 02:34:31,500
We don't jump on the fish, do we?

3407
02:34:31,560 --> 02:34:32,340
I think we do.

3408
02:34:33,280 --> 02:34:36,880
I'm pretty sure we gotta jump on the fish to use it as like a...

3409
02:34:37,820 --> 02:34:38,960
As like a boost.

3410
02:34:39,940 --> 02:34:41,800
Down the lily pad and with the...

3411
02:34:43,520 --> 02:34:44,400
I got...

3412
02:34:45,780 --> 02:34:47,360
We gotta bait it.

3413
02:34:48,740 --> 02:34:51,760
Yeah, I think we gotta jump on that lily pad and then another one.

3414
02:34:52,100 --> 02:34:52,600
All right.

3415
02:34:52,600 --> 02:34:53,960
Okay, and then we do it.

3416
02:34:57,180 --> 02:34:58,480
How do we bait this?

3417
02:34:58,720 --> 02:34:59,420
Oh, there it is!

3418
02:34:59,500 --> 02:35:00,300
There it is!

3419
02:35:00,320 --> 02:35:00,860
There it is, see?

3420
02:35:01,260 --> 02:35:02,280
Yeah, we bait it.

3421
02:35:04,160 --> 02:35:06,600
I know like iguanas are invasive species.

3422
02:35:06,920 --> 02:35:07,700
So they're like...

3423
02:35:07,700 --> 02:35:08,380
It's fine.

3424
02:35:08,660 --> 02:35:11,820
Because like the whole purpose is to get rid of the iguana population.

3425
02:35:15,460 --> 02:35:16,520
You know how they like...

3426
02:35:17,320 --> 02:35:19,720
It's actually crazy because like when I die...

3427
02:35:19,720 --> 02:35:20,760
Because they like freeze the...

3428
02:35:20,760 --> 02:35:21,760
Did they freeze the iguana?

3429
02:35:22,940 --> 02:35:24,140
Hey, look there's a shiny.

3430
02:35:24,300 --> 02:35:25,120
Did you not want that?

3431
02:35:26,480 --> 02:35:27,620
How do we get it?

3432
02:35:27,700 --> 02:35:28,520
I guess we'll never know.

3433
02:35:31,600 --> 02:35:34,240
Well, too bad.

3434
02:35:34,340 --> 02:35:35,740
I guess we'll never know.

3435
02:35:37,100 --> 02:35:38,680
Do I have to tie it too?

3436
02:35:40,860 --> 02:35:42,800
What if I have to tie it as well?

3437
02:35:42,880 --> 02:35:43,300
Oh, here.

3438
02:35:43,420 --> 02:35:43,900
There you go.

3439
02:35:45,040 --> 02:35:45,840
Oh, okay.

3440
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,880
So do you want me to get it for you?

3441
02:35:50,240 --> 02:35:52,960
Do you want me to get the shiny thing for you?

3442
02:35:53,080 --> 02:35:54,720
Yeah, I can actually get the shiny thing.

3443
02:35:54,840 --> 02:35:55,820
Do you want me to?

3444
02:35:56,180 --> 02:35:57,280
Do you want me to?

3445
02:35:57,420 --> 02:35:58,040
Say please.

3446
02:35:58,260 --> 02:35:58,820
Say...

3447
02:35:58,820 --> 02:35:59,920
Say please.

3448
02:36:00,360 --> 02:36:00,760
Please!

3449
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:01,560
Say...

3450
02:36:01,700 --> 02:36:02,020
Alright.

3451
02:36:03,160 --> 02:36:03,960
Please who?

3452
02:36:04,780 --> 02:36:05,920
Please, Doki!

3453
02:36:06,500 --> 02:36:06,920
Alright.

3454
02:36:19,510 --> 02:36:20,890
Get over here.

3455
02:36:31,640 --> 02:36:34,000
Oh, it's back.

3456
02:36:34,960 --> 02:36:37,680
I know he's not.

3457
02:36:37,800 --> 02:36:38,520
He's not back.

3458
02:36:39,280 --> 02:36:40,740
Oh, he's back.

3459
02:36:41,460 --> 02:36:42,260
He's back.

3460
02:36:42,920 --> 02:36:45,020
He's actually back.

3461
02:36:47,280 --> 02:36:47,780
Okay.

3462
02:36:48,140 --> 02:36:48,580
Whoa!

3463
02:36:49,400 --> 02:36:50,720
Look at us go.

3464
02:36:52,140 --> 02:36:52,900
Yippee!

3465
02:36:53,540 --> 02:36:54,820
Okay, see we're fine.

3466
02:36:55,460 --> 02:36:56,680
Oh, we killed it.

3467
02:36:56,980 --> 02:36:57,500
Oh, shit.

3468
02:36:57,640 --> 02:36:58,760
Oh my god, we should eat it.

3469
02:36:59,180 --> 02:36:59,960
Oh, where was God?

3470
02:37:00,180 --> 02:37:00,720
No, we didn't.

3471
02:37:00,760 --> 02:37:01,220
He's still alive.

3472
02:37:01,560 --> 02:37:02,540
I didn't get passed out for a bit.

3473
02:37:02,820 --> 02:37:04,820
Yeah, I think he was just tired.

3474
02:37:08,520 --> 02:37:10,040
See, everything is fine.

3475
02:37:10,200 --> 02:37:11,760
Oh, we dove into the water.

3476
02:37:12,060 --> 02:37:12,800
Yeah, I told you.

3477
02:37:13,280 --> 02:37:14,000
Everything's okay.

3478
02:37:16,180 --> 02:37:18,440
How are they going to get home and who were those men?

3479
02:37:19,140 --> 02:37:20,180
We'll never know.

3480
02:37:21,160 --> 02:37:21,520
Good.

3481
02:37:22,020 --> 02:37:24,520
To find out, we actually need to finish the game.

3482
02:37:27,180 --> 02:37:28,080
There you go.

3483
02:37:29,460 --> 02:37:29,740
Come on.

3484
02:37:29,940 --> 02:37:30,400
Get over here.

3485
02:37:30,700 --> 02:37:31,160
Get over here.

3486
02:37:31,240 --> 02:37:31,680
Get over here.

3487
02:37:31,800 --> 02:37:32,200
Get over it.

3488
02:37:32,240 --> 02:37:32,520
Let go.

3489
02:37:32,680 --> 02:37:32,920
Let go.

3490
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:33,720
You gotta let go.

3491
02:37:34,120 --> 02:37:34,480
You got...

3492
02:37:34,480 --> 02:37:35,180
This is a trespaw.

3493
02:37:35,280 --> 02:37:36,120
You gotta let go.

3494
02:37:36,400 --> 02:37:37,520
You gotta let go!

3495
02:37:41,640 --> 02:37:42,660
I mean, you can tie that.

3496
02:37:43,720 --> 02:37:44,560
Are you not gonna tie it?

3497
02:37:46,160 --> 02:37:47,440
No, I think we're supposed to pull it, no?

3498
02:37:47,520 --> 02:37:48,620
Are we supposed to pull it?

3499
02:37:48,760 --> 02:37:49,060
Maybe.

3500
02:37:49,220 --> 02:37:49,500
Are we?

3501
02:37:50,520 --> 02:37:51,780
Because what are we tying it to?

3502
02:37:52,580 --> 02:37:53,760
I can't pull it.

3503
02:37:53,980 --> 02:37:54,340
Maybe...

3504
02:37:54,340 --> 02:37:54,680
Wait, no.

3505
02:37:54,800 --> 02:37:55,140
Pull...

3506
02:37:55,140 --> 02:37:55,600
Pull...

3507
02:37:55,600 --> 02:37:56,400
Pull my side.

3508
02:37:56,460 --> 02:37:56,800
My side.

3509
02:37:56,860 --> 02:37:57,120
My side.

3510
02:37:57,160 --> 02:37:57,280
Here.

3511
02:37:57,780 --> 02:37:58,220
You pull it.

3512
02:37:58,260 --> 02:37:58,860
I think we need two.

3513
02:37:58,940 --> 02:37:59,420
We need two.

3514
02:38:00,200 --> 02:38:00,800
Wait, no.

3515
02:38:03,320 --> 02:38:03,680
What?

3516
02:38:06,380 --> 02:38:07,240
Okay, wait a minute.

3517
02:38:07,980 --> 02:38:08,960
Is there anything up here?

3518
02:38:09,280 --> 02:38:10,260
Because it lets us jump up.

3519
02:38:11,040 --> 02:38:11,400
Oh.

3520
02:38:12,040 --> 02:38:12,500
Oh, hey.

3521
02:38:13,520 --> 02:38:14,100
Yeah, see?

3522
02:38:14,160 --> 02:38:15,320
We are supposed to tie it.

3523
02:38:18,480 --> 02:38:19,620
And you tie the other thing.

3524
02:38:19,620 --> 02:38:19,680
Okay.

3525
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:24,000
And then we...

3526
02:38:25,780 --> 02:38:26,200
Wee!

3527
02:38:27,020 --> 02:38:27,440
Wee!

3528
02:38:28,700 --> 02:38:29,120
Wee!

3529
02:38:31,140 --> 02:38:31,560
Wee!

3530
02:38:32,480 --> 02:38:34,000
I feel like we do, yeah.

3531
02:38:36,760 --> 02:38:38,260
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

3532
02:38:38,360 --> 02:38:38,580
Oh.

3533
02:38:42,250 --> 02:38:43,010
Wait, what?

3534
02:38:48,300 --> 02:38:49,160
You pull it.

3535
02:38:50,980 --> 02:38:53,100
And my toe's stuck on the thingy.

3536
02:38:54,020 --> 02:38:54,740
No, no, no, no, no.

3537
02:38:55,120 --> 02:38:55,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3538
02:38:56,080 --> 02:38:56,720
And then get on it.

3539
02:38:59,180 --> 02:39:00,360
Get on what?

3540
02:39:00,720 --> 02:39:01,260
Oh!

3541
02:39:01,460 --> 02:39:02,680
Oh, yeah!

3542
02:39:03,980 --> 02:39:04,740
Wee!

3543
02:39:06,820 --> 02:39:08,400
And then you swing through.

3544
02:39:09,460 --> 02:39:10,800
Gotta swing in through here.

3545
02:39:12,180 --> 02:39:12,960
Look at that.

3546
02:39:13,160 --> 02:39:13,780
Teamwork.

3547
02:39:14,700 --> 02:39:15,080
See?

3548
02:39:16,180 --> 02:39:17,400
Our marriage is fixable.

3549
02:39:19,880 --> 02:39:20,460
Brick.

3550
02:39:22,360 --> 02:39:23,120
Oh.

3551
02:39:25,460 --> 02:39:27,640
Wait, you have to tie this or...?

3552
02:39:28,360 --> 02:39:29,440
We need brick.

3553
02:39:31,840 --> 02:39:33,460
Is there another place to tie up?

3554
02:39:33,860 --> 02:39:34,340
This.

3555
02:39:36,920 --> 02:39:39,240
No, because I think that's supposed to break the floor.

3556
02:39:39,240 --> 02:39:39,580
No, here.

3557
02:39:41,180 --> 02:39:41,900
There you go.

3558
02:39:43,340 --> 02:39:44,300
And then...

3559
02:39:44,300 --> 02:39:45,240
Wait, what's over here?

3560
02:39:49,410 --> 02:39:50,730
I feel like SpongeBob.

3561
02:39:51,190 --> 02:39:51,990
Oh, wait, what?

3562
02:39:52,250 --> 02:39:52,930
What's this?

3563
02:39:56,550 --> 02:39:57,330
Wait, wait, wait.

3564
02:39:57,870 --> 02:39:58,810
Okay, stay in there.

3565
02:39:59,130 --> 02:39:59,450
Wait.

3566
02:40:01,550 --> 02:40:02,510
I'm trying.

3567
02:40:02,970 --> 02:40:05,910
lol I'm trying.

3568
02:40:07,270 --> 02:40:08,170
There you go.

3569
02:40:08,490 --> 02:40:08,890
All right.

3570
02:40:09,230 --> 02:40:09,470
And then...

3571
02:40:10,250 --> 02:40:12,910
What if I go up and you stay right there and then you tie it?

3572
02:40:13,250 --> 02:40:14,550
I can't tie anything here.

3573
02:40:14,590 --> 02:40:14,930
Can I?

3574
02:40:15,750 --> 02:40:16,490
Oh, I can.

3575
02:40:16,550 --> 02:40:16,830
I can.

3576
02:40:16,870 --> 02:40:17,250
Yeah, yeah, here.

3577
02:40:21,120 --> 02:40:21,940
I tied it.

3578
02:40:23,440 --> 02:40:24,100
There we go.

3579
02:40:24,460 --> 02:40:25,420
Wait, no, no, no, no.

3580
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:26,240
Oh.

3581
02:40:27,100 --> 02:40:27,860
From where I tied this.

3582
02:40:28,080 --> 02:40:28,700
I think I can tie here.

3583
02:40:28,980 --> 02:40:29,280
Okay.

3584
02:40:30,200 --> 02:40:31,340
Oh, and you bring the brick over.

3585
02:40:31,420 --> 02:40:32,320
You gotta bring the brick over.

3586
02:40:32,440 --> 02:40:33,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3587
02:40:34,960 --> 02:40:37,260
And then we tie the second bridge up there.

3588
02:40:37,620 --> 02:40:38,100
Yeah.

3589
02:40:38,800 --> 02:40:40,120
But you have to tie it.

3590
02:40:40,920 --> 02:40:41,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3591
02:40:41,480 --> 02:40:43,000
So I'm gonna put the bridge in here...

3592
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:44,020
Uh, the brick in here.

3593
02:40:44,260 --> 02:40:44,520
Yeah.

3594
02:40:45,300 --> 02:40:47,340
And then I'm gonna attach here.

3595
02:40:49,340 --> 02:40:51,080
Oh wait, I accidentally untied it.

3596
02:40:51,720 --> 02:40:52,860
You're gonna have to tie your side again.

3597
02:40:55,620 --> 02:40:56,340
Don't worry.

3598
02:40:56,680 --> 02:40:57,780
I do my job.

3599
02:40:58,720 --> 02:41:00,380
And then I bring it over.

3600
02:41:04,050 --> 02:41:05,010
And then...

3601
02:41:05,010 --> 02:41:05,730
We did it!

3602
02:41:06,730 --> 02:41:07,050
Wait.

3603
02:41:08,830 --> 02:41:09,590
No, we didn't.

3604
02:41:11,610 --> 02:41:12,570
We didn't do it.

3605
02:41:13,150 --> 02:41:13,810
Wait, wait, wait!

3606
02:41:13,850 --> 02:41:14,610
You push it and then...

3607
02:41:15,170 --> 02:41:16,530
You push it, you push it, you push it.

3608
02:41:17,390 --> 02:41:17,910
Push what?

3609
02:41:18,150 --> 02:41:19,070
Push the brick, push the brick!

3610
02:41:19,290 --> 02:41:19,890
I do the jump!

3611
02:41:23,360 --> 02:41:23,680
Whee!

3612
02:41:25,400 --> 02:41:26,580
Oh my God, I almost fell off.

3613
02:41:31,360 --> 02:41:32,600
See, look at that physics.

3614
02:41:33,540 --> 02:41:35,200
Why is it so peaceful now?

3615
02:41:35,200 --> 02:41:35,780
I know, right?

3616
02:41:36,760 --> 02:41:38,060
It makes me feel calm.

3617
02:41:38,480 --> 02:41:38,900
Yeah.

3618
02:41:39,300 --> 02:41:39,620
Uh-oh.

3619
02:41:39,920 --> 02:41:40,360
What's that?

3620
02:41:40,900 --> 02:41:41,700
No, what is that?

3621
02:41:43,740 --> 02:41:45,340
No, it's just the music's changing.

3622
02:41:45,500 --> 02:41:46,940
It makes me feel like something's about to happen.

3623
02:41:47,740 --> 02:41:48,600
Oh, there's a swan!

3624
02:41:48,920 --> 02:41:49,940
It's a sleeping swan!

3625
02:41:50,200 --> 02:41:50,980
Oh my God!

3626
02:41:51,380 --> 02:41:53,020
Oh my God, she's sleeping!

3627
02:41:53,740 --> 02:41:54,640
Oh my God!

3628
02:41:57,480 --> 02:41:58,720
It's like a little freaking...

3629
02:42:02,120 --> 02:42:02,540
Oh.

3630
02:42:03,040 --> 02:42:03,960
Oh, there's us.

3631
02:42:04,100 --> 02:42:04,280
What's happening?

3632
02:42:04,280 --> 02:42:05,560
Are we adults now?

3633
02:42:05,940 --> 02:42:07,220
Oh my God.

3634
02:42:07,220 --> 02:42:08,420
What do you mean we're adults now?

3635
02:42:08,480 --> 02:42:09,800
I think they're the same size as you are.

3636
02:42:10,500 --> 02:42:12,180
Whoa, girl.

3637
02:42:17,730 --> 02:42:18,290
Shiny.

3638
02:42:20,170 --> 02:42:21,230
Shiny replay!

3639
02:42:27,870 --> 02:42:30,690
That moment where I realize she's actually a girl.

3640
02:42:36,850 --> 02:42:37,970
My bro's a girl.

3641
02:42:38,030 --> 02:42:38,510
Holy fuck.

3642
02:42:52,270 --> 02:42:52,590
Female.

3643
02:42:54,430 --> 02:42:55,070
Mind blown.

3644
02:43:01,080 --> 02:43:01,600
Oh, shit.

3645
02:43:01,640 --> 02:43:02,480
We have to go all the way up there?

3646
02:43:02,580 --> 02:43:03,120
How the fuck?

3647
02:43:03,220 --> 02:43:03,420
Oh.

3648
02:43:03,680 --> 02:43:04,720
Oh, they unlocked it!

3649
02:43:06,940 --> 02:43:09,140
Why the fuck can't just like just do everything on its own then?

3650
02:43:09,300 --> 02:43:10,480
Yeah, why didn't he does for?

3651
02:43:10,600 --> 02:43:11,780
You can literally unlock shit.

3652
02:43:13,200 --> 02:43:14,760
I can open portals and shit.

3653
02:43:16,280 --> 02:43:16,520
Okay.

3654
02:43:16,800 --> 02:43:17,300
Right side.

3655
02:43:17,420 --> 02:43:17,620
Right side.

3656
02:43:17,660 --> 02:43:17,820
No!

3657
02:43:17,960 --> 02:43:18,140
Right!

3658
02:43:19,140 --> 02:43:22,040
Sorry, I was pressing alt to jump because I've been playing MapleStory.

3659
02:43:24,640 --> 02:43:25,080
Okay.

3660
02:43:26,480 --> 02:43:27,080
Is this one?

3661
02:43:31,080 --> 02:43:32,360
We're making good progress.

3662
02:43:45,180 --> 02:43:46,060
All right.

3663
02:43:46,340 --> 02:43:47,360
Oh, now it's evil.

3664
02:43:47,640 --> 02:43:48,340
It's scary.

3665
02:43:48,560 --> 02:43:49,180
Yeah, why is it scary?

3666
02:43:49,180 --> 02:43:51,480
Stop picking up shiny things off the floor.

3667
02:43:52,800 --> 02:43:54,540
You don't know where it's been.

3668
02:43:54,560 --> 02:43:56,460
It's going to be worth millions in the future.

3669
02:43:56,560 --> 02:43:57,380
You don't know.

3670
02:43:57,460 --> 02:43:57,840
What is it?

3671
02:43:57,900 --> 02:43:58,300
What is it?

3672
02:43:58,300 --> 02:43:58,720
What is it?

3673
02:43:58,740 --> 02:43:59,080
What is it?

3674
02:43:59,100 --> 02:43:59,580
What do you pick up?

3675
02:43:59,680 --> 02:44:00,080
What do you pick up?

3676
02:44:00,860 --> 02:44:01,640
Oh my god.

3677
02:44:01,680 --> 02:44:01,940
Fuck.

3678
02:44:02,920 --> 02:44:03,560
Oh, oh.

3679
02:44:04,080 --> 02:44:04,400
Whoa!

3680
02:44:05,240 --> 02:44:05,880
Oh, shit!

3681
02:44:05,940 --> 02:44:06,240
Oh, shit!

3682
02:44:06,280 --> 02:44:06,660
Don't let them!

3683
02:44:06,940 --> 02:44:07,760
The po-po's here!

3684
02:44:09,920 --> 02:44:10,880
The po-po's here!

3685
02:44:10,940 --> 02:44:11,800
Don't let them get you!

3686
02:44:13,040 --> 02:44:13,360
Please!

3687
02:44:13,460 --> 02:44:14,880
I didn't pay my parking tickets.

3688
02:44:14,960 --> 02:44:15,260
Let's go!

3689
02:44:15,260 --> 02:44:18,940
I don't even drive!

3690
02:44:19,800 --> 02:44:20,900
I didn't pay my parking tickets!

3691
02:44:21,220 --> 02:44:22,400
I can't get caught again!

3692
02:44:24,060 --> 02:44:24,620
Scatter!

3693
02:44:24,680 --> 02:44:27,380
Another evolving Skye's Pokemon trainer box.

3694
02:44:28,120 --> 02:44:28,500
What?

3695
02:44:29,660 --> 02:44:31,340
It's worth $700 now.

3696
02:44:31,420 --> 02:44:32,300
You can sell it for $700.

3697
02:44:32,700 --> 02:44:34,000
What the fuck?

3698
02:44:37,160 --> 02:44:39,120
All right, Jesus.

3699
02:44:39,280 --> 02:44:40,340
It's the fuzz.

3700
02:44:42,460 --> 02:44:43,000
Get up.

3701
02:44:43,020 --> 02:44:43,360
Get up here.

3702
02:44:43,460 --> 02:44:43,660
Get up.

3703
02:44:43,660 --> 02:44:44,000
Get up here.

3704
02:44:44,100 --> 02:44:46,440
Get- Get up.

3705
02:44:49,980 --> 02:44:50,800
All right, speed run.

3706
02:44:50,900 --> 02:44:51,200
Speed run.

3707
02:44:51,260 --> 02:44:51,720
We got this.

3708
02:44:51,800 --> 02:44:52,120
Speed run.

3709
02:44:52,200 --> 02:44:52,420
Let's go.

3710
02:44:52,480 --> 02:44:52,700
Let's go.

3711
02:44:52,760 --> 02:44:53,000
Let's go.

3712
02:44:53,020 --> 02:44:53,300
Let's go.

3713
02:44:53,340 --> 02:44:53,640
Let's go.

3714
02:44:53,680 --> 02:44:55,000
We can't let the cops get here, too.

3715
02:44:55,120 --> 02:44:55,420
Let's go.

3716
02:44:55,480 --> 02:44:55,660
Let's go.

3717
02:44:55,780 --> 02:44:56,180
Let's go.

3718
02:44:56,240 --> 02:44:56,540
Let's go.

3719
02:44:56,580 --> 02:44:58,360
Why is the string so fucking long?

3720
02:44:58,460 --> 02:44:58,720
Gumi!

3721
02:44:59,080 --> 02:45:01,300
Why is it so long if we're supposed to go?

3722
02:45:02,280 --> 02:45:03,420
I'm looking around...

3723
02:45:05,060 --> 02:45:07,740
So we can do the things we need to do.

3724
02:45:10,660 --> 02:45:11,300
Here we go.

3725
02:45:13,680 --> 02:45:14,180
All right.

3726
02:45:14,180 --> 02:45:16,380
You want me to raise you up, princess?

3727
02:45:17,480 --> 02:45:18,000
Oh, go, go.

3728
02:45:18,580 --> 02:45:19,440
I push it.

3729
02:45:20,700 --> 02:45:22,100
Wait, I don't push it?

3730
02:45:23,040 --> 02:45:24,140
You don't know that.

3731
02:45:25,260 --> 02:45:25,460
Wait.

3732
02:45:25,600 --> 02:45:27,020
Oh, oh, here, here, here.

3733
02:45:27,860 --> 02:45:28,120
Up.

3734
02:45:28,340 --> 02:45:28,740
Get up.

3735
02:45:32,270 --> 02:45:32,810
All right.

3736
02:45:37,020 --> 02:45:38,220
I want to feel tall.

3737
02:45:38,440 --> 02:45:40,820
I want to feel tall.

3738
02:45:42,380 --> 02:45:42,840
Yay.

3739
02:45:46,640 --> 02:45:47,100
Careful.

3740
02:45:47,840 --> 02:45:48,240
Careful.

3741
02:45:49,260 --> 02:45:50,220
Look, it's right here.

3742
02:45:50,320 --> 02:45:51,520
There's a monster right here.

3743
02:45:51,640 --> 02:45:53,500
You can't jump here, so you gotta be careful.

3744
02:45:54,300 --> 02:45:55,760
All right, so here you go.

3745
02:45:55,840 --> 02:45:56,560
Do what I do.

3746
02:45:57,040 --> 02:45:57,800
Oh, wow.

3747
02:45:58,300 --> 02:45:58,700
Wowee.

3748
02:45:59,040 --> 02:46:02,160
I literally said careful like three times and you just ignored it.

3749
02:46:03,840 --> 02:46:05,680
I think we need to jump from this and then...

3750
02:46:08,300 --> 02:46:09,100
I'm scared!

3751
02:46:10,300 --> 02:46:11,720
Gumi, it's easy.

3752
02:46:11,980 --> 02:46:12,960
It's very easy.

3753
02:46:13,220 --> 02:46:13,440
You just...

3754
02:46:14,380 --> 02:46:15,180
You hold...

3755
02:46:15,180 --> 02:46:15,620
Okay, you see?

3756
02:46:15,660 --> 02:46:16,260
I'll tell you when to jump.

3757
02:46:16,320 --> 02:46:16,980
I'll tell you when to do it.

3758
02:46:18,120 --> 02:46:18,640
Now.

3759
02:46:19,360 --> 02:46:19,880
See?

3760
02:46:20,080 --> 02:46:20,620
Look at that.

3761
02:46:21,340 --> 02:46:23,720
You said it as I was already jumping.

3762
02:46:23,780 --> 02:46:25,000
Oh, there's a guy up there.

3763
02:46:25,360 --> 02:46:26,580
I didn't see.

3764
02:46:27,440 --> 02:46:27,960
Okay.

3765
02:46:28,220 --> 02:46:28,900
Oh, there's that.

3766
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:30,140
That's also a death hole.

3767
02:46:30,300 --> 02:46:35,640
But like, it's so hard to see this one.

3768
02:46:36,040 --> 02:46:36,540
It's actually...

3769
02:46:38,220 --> 02:46:40,280
This one's actually like difficult to see.

3770
02:46:47,510 --> 02:46:48,870
Oh, it's like Mega Man.

3771
02:46:52,190 --> 02:46:53,350
We gotta do this.

3772
02:46:58,060 --> 02:46:58,380
Nice.

3773
02:47:00,520 --> 02:47:00,840
See?

3774
02:47:00,940 --> 02:47:01,320
Look at that.

3775
02:47:01,500 --> 02:47:02,900
Speedrun, speedrun, speedrun.

3776
02:47:03,020 --> 02:47:04,100
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

3777
02:47:07,540 --> 02:47:08,020
Oh, wait.

3778
02:47:08,060 --> 02:47:08,700
What are they doing?

3779
02:47:08,820 --> 02:47:09,420
They're going through...

3780
02:47:09,420 --> 02:47:10,240
Oh, they're still hiding.

3781
02:47:11,460 --> 02:47:12,620
They're still hiding from the adults.

3782
02:47:12,960 --> 02:47:13,540
Oh, no!

3783
02:47:13,640 --> 02:47:14,220
That's me!

3784
02:47:14,320 --> 02:47:14,820
That's me!

3785
02:47:14,940 --> 02:47:18,060
No, don't you do anything!

3786
02:47:20,340 --> 02:47:22,300
You just let me get kidnapped like that!

3787
02:47:24,740 --> 02:47:25,460
That was me!

3788
02:47:25,540 --> 02:47:26,160
God save me!

3789
02:47:26,180 --> 02:47:27,980
It's really nice in this game, isn't it?

3790
02:47:28,360 --> 02:47:29,420
We gotta save...

3791
02:47:29,880 --> 02:47:32,160
Oh my god, we gotta save me!

3792
02:47:33,720 --> 02:47:34,200
Let go.

3793
02:47:35,460 --> 02:47:37,080
You slide down, you slide down, you slide down.

3794
02:47:37,120 --> 02:47:37,720
There's a little hole there.

3795
02:47:38,420 --> 02:47:39,620
You would know if you save me.

3796
02:47:42,540 --> 02:47:42,860
Huh?

3797
02:47:42,960 --> 02:47:43,380
What'd you say?

3798
02:47:44,980 --> 02:47:45,300
Jump.

3799
02:47:45,760 --> 02:47:46,040
Jump.

3800
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:49,480
There you go.

3801
02:47:51,240 --> 02:47:52,320
Oh my god, we gotta save myself.

3802
02:47:52,340 --> 02:47:55,220
Wait, don't you agree that the soundtrack is pretty nice in this game?

3803
02:47:55,260 --> 02:47:55,760
No, it is.

3804
02:47:55,780 --> 02:47:56,580
It's actually really nice.

3805
02:47:56,680 --> 02:47:57,960
It actually controls the mood right now.

3806
02:47:57,980 --> 02:48:00,680
It calms me down from my anger problems.

3807
02:48:01,300 --> 02:48:01,440
Huh?

3808
02:48:07,200 --> 02:48:08,340
I gotta swing.

3809
02:48:13,840 --> 02:48:15,160
Do you think I can make the jump?

3810
02:48:15,460 --> 02:48:15,780
No.

3811
02:48:24,110 --> 02:48:25,790
You see how I did that?

3812
02:48:27,490 --> 02:48:28,410
I hit the wall?

3813
02:48:31,370 --> 02:48:33,670
Now you do it too.

3814
02:48:34,750 --> 02:48:35,610
You gotta learn.

3815
02:48:35,710 --> 02:48:36,430
You have to learn.

3816
02:48:36,630 --> 02:48:37,130
You have to learn.

3817
02:48:37,190 --> 02:48:38,350
You can't rely on me all the time.

3818
02:48:38,410 --> 02:48:39,110
You have to learn.

3819
02:48:39,570 --> 02:48:40,190
There you go.

3820
02:48:40,290 --> 02:48:40,810
You can't...

3821
02:48:40,810 --> 02:48:41,150
Okay.

3822
02:48:41,350 --> 02:48:42,350
I've been pressing...

3823
02:48:42,890 --> 02:48:46,950
I've been pressing down instead of left to guide the rope back.

3824
02:48:47,070 --> 02:48:47,930
Oh, yeah.

3825
02:48:49,230 --> 02:48:51,070
I don't know why I've been pressing down.

3826
02:48:51,250 --> 02:48:52,010
Oh, this is timed.

3827
02:48:53,630 --> 02:48:54,070
Right?

3828
02:48:55,450 --> 02:48:55,890
Yeah.

3829
02:48:56,550 --> 02:48:57,090
It is.

3830
02:48:57,950 --> 02:48:58,390
I don't know why I've been pressing down.

3831
02:49:03,810 --> 02:49:05,150
This is like Mega Man.

3832
02:49:10,050 --> 02:49:10,630
Come on.

3833
02:49:10,710 --> 02:49:11,050
Come on.

3834
02:49:11,130 --> 02:49:11,710
Get over here.

3835
02:49:12,130 --> 02:49:12,990
Whoa, there's rats!

3836
02:49:13,830 --> 02:49:15,650
Oh, I have to step on this and then...

3837
02:49:16,750 --> 02:49:17,870
And then you go up from here.

3838
02:49:20,970 --> 02:49:21,770
And then...

3839
02:49:24,050 --> 02:49:24,450
Uh...

3840
02:49:25,230 --> 02:49:25,910
Oh, okay.

3841
02:49:27,170 --> 02:49:28,070
Then what about me?

3842
02:49:30,030 --> 02:49:30,810
What about me?

3843
02:49:31,670 --> 02:49:33,570
Is there nothing to help you up here?

3844
02:49:34,350 --> 02:49:35,930
Oh, well, then I pull it.

3845
02:49:35,930 --> 02:49:36,690
Yeah, you pull it.

3846
02:49:36,710 --> 02:49:37,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3847
02:49:38,570 --> 02:49:39,830
Yeah, I need you to let go.

3848
02:49:41,030 --> 02:49:42,050
And then I'll pull you up.

3849
02:49:43,270 --> 02:49:44,350
But then, don't we...

3850
02:49:44,350 --> 02:49:47,750
No, you have to press this and then I go up here and then I can pull you up.

3851
02:49:47,830 --> 02:49:48,370
No, no, no, no.

3852
02:49:48,390 --> 02:49:49,230
Yep, here we go.

3853
02:49:49,970 --> 02:49:50,490
Here we go.

3854
02:49:50,950 --> 02:49:51,270
Teamworks.

3855
02:49:51,730 --> 02:49:52,150
Get over here.

3856
02:49:52,230 --> 02:49:52,610
Get over here.

3857
02:49:52,630 --> 02:49:53,110
Get over here.

3858
02:49:53,110 --> 02:49:53,530
Come on.

3859
02:49:53,990 --> 02:49:54,690
Get over here.

3860
02:49:55,290 --> 02:49:56,090
There you go.

3861
02:49:56,450 --> 02:49:57,130
My leg fell asleep.

3862
02:49:57,510 --> 02:49:57,830
Oh.

3863
02:49:58,050 --> 02:49:59,090
Oh, you sit crisscross?

3864
02:49:59,570 --> 02:50:00,670
It's not good for your legs.

3865
02:50:01,330 --> 02:50:01,830
But that's you.

3866
02:50:01,930 --> 02:50:03,390
Oh, now you're gonna try and save my life.

3867
02:50:05,950 --> 02:50:07,130
Does that need this?

3868
02:50:07,690 --> 02:50:08,350
I don't think so.

3869
02:50:08,350 --> 02:50:08,790
I don't know.

3870
02:50:09,110 --> 02:50:11,170
I mean, we should just see what's ahead of us first.

3871
02:50:11,550 --> 02:50:12,150
Yeah, we don't.

3872
02:50:12,350 --> 02:50:12,530
See?

3873
02:50:15,290 --> 02:50:17,730
I understand that we're two very different type of players.

3874
02:50:17,850 --> 02:50:19,130
But you want to go ahead and see.

3875
02:50:19,390 --> 02:50:20,930
Like, just run ahead first.

3876
02:50:21,230 --> 02:50:24,470
And I'm very much the type that, like, wants to sit around and look at things.

3877
02:50:26,870 --> 02:50:28,370
And that's why we're in counseling.

3878
02:50:29,650 --> 02:50:30,090
What?

3879
02:50:36,450 --> 02:50:38,170
Oh, we have to jump up.

3880
02:50:38,650 --> 02:50:38,930
Yeah.

3881
02:50:39,650 --> 02:50:40,810
We're gonna jump to the left.

3882
02:50:41,870 --> 02:50:44,090
I think we'll find out when we're up top.

3883
02:50:44,550 --> 02:50:46,550
I can't jump because you're here.

3884
02:50:48,650 --> 02:50:49,130
Please.

3885
02:50:49,590 --> 02:50:51,310
The yarn isn't long enough.

3886
02:50:51,430 --> 02:50:51,730
Yeah, see?

3887
02:50:51,790 --> 02:50:52,190
It's up here.

3888
02:50:56,130 --> 02:50:57,150
Okay, don't get...

3889
02:50:57,150 --> 02:50:58,370
Okay, we gotta wait here.

3890
02:50:59,450 --> 02:51:01,450
And then weeeeee.

3891
02:51:03,150 --> 02:51:03,630
Weeeeee.

3892
02:51:03,730 --> 02:51:04,630
And then we...

3893
02:51:05,550 --> 02:51:06,430
Oh my god!

3894
02:51:06,470 --> 02:51:06,990
Oh my god!

3895
02:51:06,990 --> 02:51:07,650
Gumi.

3896
02:51:08,030 --> 02:51:08,910
Please, Gumi.

3897
02:51:09,250 --> 02:51:09,810
Please!

3898
02:51:10,370 --> 02:51:12,050
This is what we learned, Gumi!

3899
02:51:12,210 --> 02:51:14,150
This is literally what we learned together!

3900
02:51:14,510 --> 02:51:15,510
This is what we learned!

3901
02:51:19,030 --> 02:51:21,150
We learned this together!

3902
02:51:22,010 --> 02:51:22,350
Please!

3903
02:51:26,930 --> 02:51:28,390
Oh my god.

3904
02:51:30,350 --> 02:51:30,910
Okay.

3905
02:51:33,130 --> 02:51:34,750
I think the shiny's still left.

3906
02:51:34,810 --> 02:51:35,410
Do you want it?

3907
02:51:41,330 --> 02:51:43,570
Oh my god.

3908
02:51:43,570 --> 02:51:44,210
Oh, what happened?

3909
02:51:44,310 --> 02:51:45,930
What happened to the shiny, huh?

3910
02:51:46,450 --> 02:51:49,530
What happened to the shiny?

3911
02:51:49,690 --> 02:51:50,690
Didn't you want the shiny?

3912
02:51:51,210 --> 02:51:51,470
You're right.

3913
02:51:51,550 --> 02:51:52,210
We should get it.

3914
02:51:52,370 --> 02:51:53,090
No, it's too late.

3915
02:51:53,190 --> 02:51:53,470
I already...

3916
02:51:54,950 --> 02:51:55,550
I lied.

3917
02:51:55,590 --> 02:51:56,110
There's no shiny.

3918
02:51:56,990 --> 02:51:57,610
I lied.

3919
02:51:59,430 --> 02:52:00,150
I lied.

3920
02:52:06,470 --> 02:52:09,030
I just didn't think you would actually want it.

3921
02:52:11,870 --> 02:52:12,390
Okay.

3922
02:52:16,910 --> 02:52:18,530
All right, okay.

3923
02:52:21,390 --> 02:52:22,250
Come on, Gumi.

3924
02:52:22,330 --> 02:52:22,790
We're gamers.

3925
02:52:23,090 --> 02:52:23,650
Come on.

3926
02:52:26,890 --> 02:52:27,970
Come on, let go.

3927
02:52:30,790 --> 02:52:31,550
All right.

3928
02:52:31,990 --> 02:52:32,050
See?

3929
02:52:32,170 --> 02:52:33,130
Everything is fine.

3930
02:52:33,310 --> 02:52:34,170
Everything is fine.

3931
02:52:35,290 --> 02:52:36,130
There's no shiny.

3932
02:52:36,270 --> 02:52:36,970
It was a myth.

3933
02:52:37,030 --> 02:52:37,790
It was a lie.

3934
02:52:38,150 --> 02:52:40,150
It was a lie to bait you.

3935
02:52:40,270 --> 02:52:41,850
You are just like a man.

3936
02:52:42,590 --> 02:52:42,850
What?

3937
02:52:43,650 --> 02:52:44,870
Gumi, who hurt you?

3938
02:52:45,490 --> 02:52:46,630
Everybody lies.

3939
02:52:46,990 --> 02:52:47,750
Doesn't matter.

3940
02:52:50,870 --> 02:52:51,990
Everybody lies.

3941
02:52:52,490 --> 02:52:54,210
I'm lying to you right now.

3942
02:52:56,890 --> 02:52:57,450
What?

3943
02:53:06,030 --> 02:53:08,790
Gumi, women lie all the time.

3944
02:53:08,870 --> 02:53:09,390
It's not...

3945
02:53:13,550 --> 02:53:14,230
Anything...

3946
02:53:14,230 --> 02:53:16,370
I'm doing it right now.

3947
02:53:22,190 --> 02:53:24,290
All right, here we go.

3948
02:53:32,710 --> 02:53:34,390
Why don't we do this one?

3949
02:53:34,890 --> 02:53:35,770
We swing...

3950
02:53:35,770 --> 02:53:37,210
We can't swing past it.

3951
02:53:39,310 --> 02:53:40,770
Is that green thing something?

3952
02:53:42,050 --> 02:53:42,490
Maybe?

3953
02:53:48,090 --> 02:53:50,670
Can you try walking up it while I'm hanging onto it?

3954
02:53:50,830 --> 02:53:51,990
No, it's a conveyor belt.

3955
02:53:52,070 --> 02:53:53,130
It's a conveyor belt.

3956
02:53:53,430 --> 02:53:54,070
Oh, it is?

3957
02:53:54,330 --> 02:53:55,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3958
02:53:57,070 --> 02:54:00,190
I don't think the green thing's anything because we can't interact with it.

3959
02:54:00,430 --> 02:54:01,550
Yeah, I don't think so either.

3960
02:54:01,730 --> 02:54:02,790
Do we just swing really...

3961
02:54:02,790 --> 02:54:04,390
Oh, we just keep swinging maybe?

3962
02:54:04,750 --> 02:54:05,590
Oh, we swing.

3963
02:54:05,590 --> 02:54:08,610
We swing to the very top thing and then...

3964
02:54:09,810 --> 02:54:11,650
And then bounce over it, I think.

3965
02:54:15,630 --> 02:54:16,890
Oh, wait, how the...

3966
02:54:16,890 --> 02:54:17,530
Oh, no.

3967
02:54:17,930 --> 02:54:18,810
Wait, I think I can...

3968
02:54:19,410 --> 02:54:20,550
I think I can use you.

3969
02:54:21,770 --> 02:54:22,170
What?

3970
02:54:22,430 --> 02:54:23,430
I think I can use you.

3971
02:54:25,070 --> 02:54:25,730
There we go.

3972
02:54:26,450 --> 02:54:27,570
Wait, wait, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3973
02:54:28,550 --> 02:54:30,790
All right, Dodger, you're just making this harder for yourself.

3974
02:54:30,890 --> 02:54:32,290
You're just making it harder for yourself.

3975
02:54:36,420 --> 02:54:38,440
You say you're gonna use me.

3976
02:54:39,580 --> 02:54:42,260
Because that's the mechanic of the video game!

3977
02:54:45,860 --> 02:54:47,160
Gumi, maybe you need...

3978
02:54:47,160 --> 02:54:48,260
Why can't you say use your help?

3979
02:54:48,320 --> 02:54:49,540
Gumi, maybe you need...

3980
02:54:49,540 --> 02:54:51,660
I don't think it's a couple's counseling.

3981
02:54:51,840 --> 02:54:54,480
I think it's individual therapy right now.

3982
02:55:04,220 --> 02:55:06,380
All right, get over here.

3983
02:55:06,860 --> 02:55:08,160
Get over here.

3984
02:55:10,680 --> 02:55:11,400
All right.

3985
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:15,360
Oh.

3986
02:55:16,440 --> 02:55:18,340
No, we have to...

3987
02:55:18,340 --> 02:55:19,260
That's for the shiny.

3988
02:55:20,360 --> 02:55:21,380
No, no.

3989
02:55:22,040 --> 02:55:22,560
It is?

3990
02:55:23,180 --> 02:55:24,200
Is that for the shiny?

3991
02:55:25,700 --> 02:55:27,220
Oh, okay, then we don't need to do this.

3992
02:55:29,560 --> 02:55:31,240
No, no, we have to do this.

3993
02:55:31,300 --> 02:55:31,580
Yeah.

3994
02:55:33,880 --> 02:55:34,680
Yeah, we do.

3995
02:55:37,320 --> 02:55:38,360
How do we do this?

3996
02:55:38,700 --> 02:55:40,200
Oh, wait, wait, I got it, I got it.

3997
02:55:40,200 --> 02:55:40,920
We tangle it up.

3998
02:55:43,600 --> 02:55:45,100
And then, yeah, yeah, okay.

3999
02:55:48,240 --> 02:55:49,480
Okay, I figured it out.

4000
02:55:49,960 --> 02:55:51,000
Hold on to it.

4001
02:55:55,240 --> 02:55:56,100
Wait, what?

4002
02:55:58,020 --> 02:55:58,960
There you go.

4003
02:56:00,220 --> 02:56:00,760
Get up here.

4004
02:56:02,640 --> 02:56:05,100
No, no, Gumi, no, no, no.

4005
02:56:05,180 --> 02:56:06,560
You're not getting the shiny, Gumi.

4006
02:56:06,840 --> 02:56:07,960
You're not getting the shiny.

4007
02:56:08,520 --> 02:56:09,140
You're not.

4008
02:56:09,400 --> 02:56:10,920
You're not getting the shiny.

4009
02:56:14,780 --> 02:56:15,540
Dang it.

4010
02:56:16,800 --> 02:56:17,200
Alright.

4011
02:56:17,360 --> 02:56:18,060
Wait, I can.

4012
02:56:18,780 --> 02:56:20,480
No, no, no, no, no, no.

4013
02:56:20,480 --> 02:56:21,300
You're not getting the shiny.

4014
02:56:21,460 --> 02:56:22,380
No, no.

4015
02:56:23,120 --> 02:56:23,520
No.

4016
02:56:24,680 --> 02:56:26,100
No, no, no.

4017
02:56:26,120 --> 02:56:27,040
You're not getting the shiny.

4018
02:56:27,880 --> 02:56:28,280
No.

4019
02:56:28,720 --> 02:56:29,960
I just...

4020
02:56:29,960 --> 02:56:30,940
Alright, you get one try.

4021
02:56:31,040 --> 02:56:31,820
You get one try.

4022
02:56:31,940 --> 02:56:33,900
You get one try and I'm pulling you over after that.

4023
02:56:40,880 --> 02:56:41,740
Are you happy?

4024
02:56:42,140 --> 02:56:42,700
Are you happy?

4025
02:56:46,260 --> 02:56:46,820
Get up.

4026
02:56:47,160 --> 02:56:47,280
Get up.

4027
02:56:47,300 --> 02:56:47,860
I am.

4028
02:56:49,540 --> 02:56:51,120
I remember what I did for you.

4029
02:56:53,100 --> 02:56:54,740
Well, I suddenly really wanted...

4030
02:56:55,460 --> 02:56:56,900
Doenjang Jjigae when you said that.

4031
02:56:57,920 --> 02:56:59,500
I don't know why, but like...

4032
02:56:59,500 --> 02:57:00,540
I suddenly had a craving.

4033
02:57:03,640 --> 02:57:06,460
But I ate that like two days in a row, so maybe there's something going on.

4034
02:57:08,440 --> 02:57:09,400
Alright, let's go.

4035
02:57:10,680 --> 02:57:11,060
I'm...

4036
02:57:12,240 --> 02:57:13,340
It's fine, it's fine.

4037
02:57:13,780 --> 02:57:14,180
Just...

4038
02:57:14,180 --> 02:57:14,700
Do that.

4039
02:57:15,200 --> 02:57:15,840
Is that what I did?

4040
02:57:16,920 --> 02:57:18,000
Is that what I did?

4041
02:57:18,400 --> 02:57:19,780
You see that shiny over there?

4042
02:57:20,240 --> 02:57:20,620
Where?

4043
02:57:23,940 --> 02:57:26,000
Oh, I didn't see the grain on the floor.

4044
02:57:28,840 --> 02:57:30,620
That's how I feel after that.

4045
02:57:32,040 --> 02:57:34,080
You said, you see that shiny over there?

4046
02:57:34,380 --> 02:57:39,460
I think I have to

4047
02:57:42,560 --> 02:57:43,920
go at the bottom, I think.

4048
02:57:47,500 --> 02:57:49,060
Because I pressed the button for it.

4049
02:57:56,100 --> 02:57:56,540
Yeah.

4050
02:57:59,900 --> 02:58:01,500
But if you want the shiny, it's this way.

4051
02:58:04,740 --> 02:58:06,000
I can figure it out.

4052
02:58:06,420 --> 02:58:07,260
Get over here.

4053
02:58:08,160 --> 02:58:09,020
Wait, how do I get over here?

4054
02:58:09,020 --> 02:58:09,860
I see it.

4055
02:58:10,080 --> 02:58:10,820
I see it.

4056
02:58:10,900 --> 02:58:11,760
How do I get over here?

4057
02:58:16,870 --> 02:58:17,510
You can't.

4058
02:58:17,510 --> 02:58:18,730
It doesn't go back up!

4059
02:58:18,830 --> 02:58:19,570
You can't.

4060
02:58:23,210 --> 02:58:24,770
I thought it would go back.

4061
02:58:25,910 --> 02:58:27,630
You only get one shiny.

4062
02:58:28,230 --> 02:58:28,370
Oh.

4063
02:58:32,630 --> 02:58:33,810
Push it down.

4064
02:58:36,450 --> 02:58:37,610
And then I do that.

4065
02:58:42,780 --> 02:58:45,830
And then...

4066
02:58:45,830 --> 02:58:47,110
Wait, how do we do this?

4067
02:58:47,670 --> 02:58:49,710
I could crush you right now.

4068
02:58:51,910 --> 02:58:52,750
You swing?

4069
02:58:54,210 --> 02:58:54,930
You swing?

4070
02:58:55,990 --> 02:58:56,550
Swing?

4071
02:58:58,690 --> 02:58:59,530
Yeah.

4072
02:59:01,730 --> 02:59:03,550
It's hard to get momentum on this, no?

4073
02:59:04,670 --> 02:59:05,130
Okay, wait.

4074
02:59:05,270 --> 02:59:06,910
Wait, I wonder how high it goes.

4075
02:59:07,350 --> 02:59:08,090
No, you crush me.

4076
02:59:08,250 --> 02:59:09,550
Yeah, it gets crushed.

4077
02:59:17,770 --> 02:59:18,630
Can you press it?

4078
02:59:20,350 --> 02:59:21,310
Press it and then maybe...

4079
02:59:23,110 --> 02:59:24,190
How do we do this?

4080
02:59:26,550 --> 02:59:27,450
Can you jump on it?

4081
02:59:29,830 --> 02:59:30,390
Oh god.

4082
02:59:31,330 --> 02:59:31,810
Wait, wait, wait!

4083
02:59:31,850 --> 02:59:32,310
I got an idea!

4084
02:59:32,370 --> 02:59:32,690
I got an idea!

4085
02:59:32,870 --> 02:59:33,310
I got an idea!

4086
02:59:33,430 --> 02:59:33,670
I got an idea!

4087
02:59:33,730 --> 02:59:34,130
Press the button!

4088
02:59:34,190 --> 02:59:34,510
Press the button!

4089
02:59:34,570 --> 02:59:34,950
Press the button!

4090
02:59:35,030 --> 02:59:35,410
Press the button!

4091
02:59:35,410 --> 02:59:35,910
And then...

4092
02:59:36,750 --> 02:59:37,790
I swing here.

4093
02:59:42,650 --> 02:59:43,210
Okay.

4094
02:59:46,930 --> 02:59:49,850
No, I pull you up!

4095
02:59:50,310 --> 02:59:50,590
Wait.

4096
02:59:52,330 --> 02:59:52,890
Here.

4097
02:59:53,370 --> 02:59:53,930
Let go.

4098
02:59:56,410 --> 02:59:56,710
Oh.

4099
02:59:57,310 --> 02:59:58,570
Well then, I guess we'll leave.

4100
03:00:02,250 --> 03:00:04,250
Well, we figured out how to do it.

4101
03:00:10,890 --> 03:00:11,710
Okay, okay, okay.

4102
03:00:11,850 --> 03:00:13,150
You go over, you go over.

4103
03:00:15,830 --> 03:00:16,630
Okay, and then...

4104
03:00:17,570 --> 03:00:19,070
You press it, you press it.

4105
03:00:19,630 --> 03:00:21,410
You press it and then I go over.

4106
03:00:21,770 --> 03:00:22,470
You let go.

4107
03:00:25,270 --> 03:00:25,990
And then...

4108
03:00:25,990 --> 03:00:27,090
Oh my god, wait.

4109
03:00:27,950 --> 03:00:28,990
How do we do this?

4110
03:00:32,430 --> 03:00:32,790
Wait.

4111
03:00:33,250 --> 03:00:34,690
I think we have to tangle this.

4112
03:00:35,910 --> 03:00:36,330
Or let's...

4113
03:00:36,330 --> 03:00:37,410
You swing here, you swing here, you swing here!

4114
03:00:37,410 --> 03:00:38,030
Oh, wait.

4115
03:00:38,030 --> 03:00:38,330
No.

4116
03:00:38,890 --> 03:00:39,210
Wait.

4117
03:00:39,850 --> 03:00:40,210
Okay.

4118
03:00:41,350 --> 03:00:42,070
My leg.

4119
03:00:49,020 --> 03:00:51,120
I feel like you have to do this, though.

4120
03:00:53,980 --> 03:00:55,020
Like, you just swing.

4121
03:00:56,720 --> 03:00:58,660
But then, how are we going to untangle the rope?

4122
03:00:59,060 --> 03:00:59,980
That's a good question.

4123
03:01:02,980 --> 03:01:03,340
Maybe...

4124
03:01:03,340 --> 03:01:03,880
Oh, wait, wait, wait!

4125
03:01:04,120 --> 03:01:06,540
Maybe, like, if you go on the other side and then...

4126
03:01:08,900 --> 03:01:12,460
No, no, no, no, no, and then...

4127
03:01:13,480 --> 03:01:14,480
Can you come down?

4128
03:01:14,840 --> 03:01:16,960
Go, go, go left, go left, go left, go left!

4129
03:01:17,120 --> 03:01:18,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, go left, go left, go left.

4130
03:01:18,920 --> 03:01:20,200
Go left, go left.

4131
03:01:21,140 --> 03:01:22,140
That's what I was thinking, yeah.

4132
03:01:23,340 --> 03:01:23,980
And then...

4133
03:01:23,980 --> 03:01:24,580
Let go.

4134
03:01:29,370 --> 03:01:30,110
Press the button.

4135
03:01:32,370 --> 03:01:34,150
Oh, no, because you can just get up there and climb up.

4136
03:01:34,170 --> 03:01:35,070
Yeah, oh yeah, here, yeah.

4137
03:01:35,570 --> 03:01:36,170
You climb up.

4138
03:01:38,530 --> 03:01:38,850
Alright.

4139
03:01:38,850 --> 03:01:39,990
And then, my turn.

4140
03:01:40,870 --> 03:01:41,370
Look at that!

4141
03:01:42,250 --> 03:01:43,150
Therapy works, guys!

4142
03:01:43,450 --> 03:01:44,090
Therapy works!

4143
03:01:45,190 --> 03:01:47,350
I'm gonna get therapy once in my entire life.

4144
03:01:47,370 --> 03:01:47,970
Go to counseling!

4145
03:01:51,010 --> 03:01:51,510
Whoa.

4146
03:01:52,670 --> 03:01:53,670
Wait, it's...

4147
03:01:53,670 --> 03:01:54,670
Oh, wait, what?

4148
03:01:55,070 --> 03:01:56,290
I think it's a timer thing.

4149
03:02:01,230 --> 03:02:01,670
Is it?

4150
03:02:01,870 --> 03:02:02,380
Does it look...

4151
03:02:04,050 --> 03:02:04,750
Then what?

4152
03:02:06,850 --> 03:02:08,590
Oh, it's a swinging thing!

4153
03:02:09,450 --> 03:02:09,950
Swing?

4154
03:02:10,430 --> 03:02:10,750
Then...

4155
03:02:12,210 --> 03:02:12,530
Oh.

4156
03:02:14,030 --> 03:02:15,070
Okay, you go, you go.

4157
03:02:15,150 --> 03:02:15,530
I hold.

4158
03:02:16,290 --> 03:02:17,450
Okay, now come over here.

4159
03:02:17,570 --> 03:02:18,530
No, no, no, I think it's like...

4160
03:02:19,610 --> 03:02:20,970
Yeah, yeah, you drop down, you drop down.

4161
03:02:21,050 --> 03:02:21,810
You have to drop down.

4162
03:02:22,030 --> 03:02:22,290
Okay.

4163
03:02:22,430 --> 03:02:24,530
Okay, but the thing is you have to stand closer to the right.

4164
03:02:24,790 --> 03:02:25,310
Oh, okay.

4165
03:02:25,430 --> 03:02:26,130
Yeah, yeah, like here.

4166
03:02:26,390 --> 03:02:28,330
And then I have to like, slowly go up and down.

4167
03:02:30,310 --> 03:02:30,770
What's up?

4168
03:02:30,770 --> 03:02:30,830
What's up?

4169
03:02:37,570 --> 03:02:40,270
Okay, okay, I figured it out.

4170
03:02:40,330 --> 03:02:41,190
I figured it out.

4171
03:02:44,490 --> 03:02:45,050
Holy...

4172
03:02:48,890 --> 03:02:50,310
You guys, it's not swinging!

4173
03:02:51,210 --> 03:02:52,630
I know, it isn't swinging!

4174
03:02:53,010 --> 03:02:53,870
It's the momentum!

4175
03:02:54,570 --> 03:02:55,950
You have to go slow!

4176
03:02:57,570 --> 03:03:00,570
Slow and steady, slow and steady.

4177
03:03:01,070 --> 03:03:01,510
Yeah!

4178
03:03:04,350 --> 03:03:07,070
There's so much power in these hands.

4179
03:03:08,110 --> 03:03:08,850
Do you see that shiny?

4180
03:03:09,630 --> 03:03:09,970
No.

4181
03:03:12,390 --> 03:03:13,370
You get one.

4182
03:03:15,910 --> 03:03:16,790
Stop talking!

4183
03:03:17,610 --> 03:03:17,930
I didn't move!

4184
03:03:18,170 --> 03:03:19,090
I didn't move!

4185
03:03:19,130 --> 03:03:19,730
I didn't even move.

4186
03:03:19,810 --> 03:03:20,190
I didn't move.

4187
03:03:20,310 --> 03:03:20,630
I saw you.

4188
03:03:20,650 --> 03:03:21,170
You got one.

4189
03:03:21,650 --> 03:03:23,030
You get one.

4190
03:03:23,170 --> 03:03:24,190
I told you, you got one.

4191
03:03:24,370 --> 03:03:25,150
You got your one.

4192
03:03:26,290 --> 03:03:27,310
I told you.

4193
03:03:27,730 --> 03:03:29,750
You moved and then you blamed me.

4194
03:03:29,750 --> 03:03:31,890
You moved and then you blamed me.

4195
03:03:31,890 --> 03:03:32,750
I didn't!

4196
03:03:32,810 --> 03:03:34,170
I didn't move!

4197
03:03:34,170 --> 03:03:35,670
I didn't move at all.

4198
03:03:35,730 --> 03:03:37,010
I did not move at all.

4199
03:03:37,090 --> 03:03:38,210
I literally stood still.

4200
03:03:38,590 --> 03:03:39,690
I literally stood still.

4201
03:03:40,030 --> 03:03:40,590
My hands are sweaty.

4202
03:03:41,550 --> 03:03:42,630
That was on you.

4203
03:03:44,570 --> 03:03:45,350
All right.

4204
03:03:53,210 --> 03:03:54,150
Here you go.

4205
03:03:58,070 --> 03:03:59,410
Is that slow enough for you?

4206
03:03:59,490 --> 03:04:00,510
Is that slow enough for you?

4207
03:04:04,770 --> 03:04:07,290
Go down, go down, go down, go down.

4208
03:04:08,410 --> 03:04:09,250
Go down!

4209
03:04:09,670 --> 03:04:10,950
But the shiny is right there.

4210
03:04:12,510 --> 03:04:13,730
Go- I said you had one.

4211
03:04:13,830 --> 03:04:14,870
I said you had one.

4212
03:04:15,150 --> 03:04:18,290
I said- I gave you a shiny or you- I- you had one.

4213
03:04:18,870 --> 03:04:20,510
You had one chance.

4214
03:04:20,750 --> 03:04:22,710
You had one chance.

4215
03:04:24,150 --> 03:04:25,250
It's not my fault.

4216
03:04:25,330 --> 03:04:26,850
You fucked up that one chance.

4217
03:04:27,410 --> 03:04:28,690
It wasn't my fault!

4218
03:04:28,710 --> 03:04:30,150
It's not- It was not my fault.

4219
03:04:30,230 --> 03:04:31,110
You fucked it up.

4220
03:04:31,350 --> 03:04:32,630
I did not move.

4221
03:04:32,650 --> 03:04:32,810
I did not move.

4222
03:04:36,070 --> 03:04:37,290
There we go.

4223
03:04:40,530 --> 03:04:42,310
Oh, the shiny.

4224
03:04:51,880 --> 03:04:53,540
Be careful, don't fall down the roller.

4225
03:04:55,360 --> 03:04:56,240
What happened?

4226
03:04:56,700 --> 03:04:58,220
What happened?

4227
03:05:00,460 --> 03:05:01,960
What happened over there?

4228
03:05:10,280 --> 03:05:11,740
Oh hey, be careful, don't fall.

4229
03:05:14,440 --> 03:05:16,940
This was a little faster than- Wait, what?

4230
03:05:17,000 --> 03:05:17,920
It hit my head.

4231
03:05:18,280 --> 03:05:20,640
It like bonked me in the head and I got concussion.

4232
03:05:27,060 --> 03:05:27,460
Okay.

4233
03:05:28,680 --> 03:05:29,080
Nice.

4234
03:05:32,710 --> 03:05:34,250
You're so sca- Oh, we can't.

4235
03:05:34,290 --> 03:05:34,790
We have to...

4236
03:05:36,210 --> 03:05:36,930
Be a little...

4237
03:05:38,790 --> 03:05:40,130
We have to do it really fast here.

4238
03:05:40,810 --> 03:05:41,030
Okay.

4239
03:05:45,130 --> 03:05:45,910
Here we go.

4240
03:05:46,350 --> 03:05:46,830
Here we go.

4241
03:05:52,280 --> 03:05:53,380
You saw that?

4242
03:05:53,540 --> 03:05:54,680
Wow, we're getting better.

4243
03:05:55,440 --> 03:05:56,500
We're so- We're gaming.

4244
03:05:57,160 --> 03:05:58,320
We're actually gaming.

4245
03:05:59,740 --> 03:06:01,340
We're actually gaming.

4246
03:06:01,880 --> 03:06:02,900
Look at- Oh shit.

4247
03:06:03,080 --> 03:06:03,900
We're- Look at me go.

4248
03:06:04,800 --> 03:06:07,580
Look- Oh my god, you ruined it.

4249
03:06:07,900 --> 03:06:09,600
You ruined the one thing that gives me joy.

4250
03:06:09,920 --> 03:06:11,200
You ruined the one thing.

4251
03:06:11,340 --> 03:06:13,800
You ruined the one thing that gave me joy, Gumi.

4252
03:06:13,800 --> 03:06:16,760
Like, I was parkouring like fucking crazy right there.

4253
03:06:18,580 --> 03:06:19,860
That's the meaning of life.

4254
03:06:21,600 --> 03:06:25,500
I can't-

4255
03:06:31,700 --> 03:06:33,300
Oh, what's over here?

4256
03:06:34,240 --> 03:06:35,400
Do you think there's a shiny?

4257
03:06:36,200 --> 03:06:37,800
No, I think this is the way to go.

4258
03:06:39,360 --> 03:06:42,440
No, that's literally the way to go.

4259
03:06:45,480 --> 03:06:48,600
All right, how do we do this?

4260
03:06:50,320 --> 03:06:51,400
Oh, we have to do this fast.

4261
03:06:53,740 --> 03:06:55,860
Well, Gumi, remember- Remember when I said we have to do this fast?

4262
03:06:55,940 --> 03:06:57,360
Remember when I said we have to do this fast?

4263
03:07:00,620 --> 03:07:00,940
Yeah?

4264
03:07:03,380 --> 03:07:06,380
Well, I'm going to be patient and wait for the next one.

4265
03:07:09,960 --> 03:07:10,280
Oh.

4266
03:07:12,420 --> 03:07:14,160
And look at that, you're doing it fast now!

4267
03:07:14,360 --> 03:07:15,820
I'm so proud of you.

4268
03:07:19,250 --> 03:07:19,690
Wheeee!

4269
03:07:23,570 --> 03:07:24,010
Wheeee!

4270
03:07:27,370 --> 03:07:28,710
This could be a fun ride.

4271
03:07:30,410 --> 03:07:33,030
But like, not like, with like less casualties.

4272
03:07:34,990 --> 03:07:36,030
I think we were- Oh.

4273
03:07:37,050 --> 03:07:38,210
I saved your life.

4274
03:07:39,470 --> 03:07:40,030
Hahahaha!

4275
03:07:42,970 --> 03:07:45,510
Okay, I can't save that.

4276
03:07:45,790 --> 03:07:47,630
I can't- I can't save stupid.

4277
03:07:50,770 --> 03:07:52,450
Gumi, we're almost done!

4278
03:07:52,550 --> 03:07:53,770
This is chapter five!

4279
03:07:56,570 --> 03:07:57,170
Gumi, please.

4280
03:08:00,770 --> 03:08:04,370
Wha- What ha- Wait, wha- Where did you go?

4281
03:08:04,370 --> 03:08:05,810
Where did you go?

4282
03:08:07,190 --> 03:08:09,970
I don't know, I couldn't see myself anymore.

4283
03:08:10,150 --> 03:08:11,790
Where did you go?

4284
03:08:16,760 --> 03:08:18,400
Oh my god.

4285
03:08:20,260 --> 03:08:21,600
You didn't commit!

4286
03:08:22,120 --> 03:08:23,520
You didn't commit!

4287
03:08:23,780 --> 03:08:24,920
You could have committed!

4288
03:08:26,100 --> 03:08:27,200
You're committing issues.

4289
03:08:29,180 --> 03:08:30,280
No, I don't!

4290
03:08:30,280 --> 03:08:31,100
Hahahaha!

4291
03:08:37,820 --> 03:08:42,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what they all say.

4292
03:08:46,380 --> 03:08:47,720
Wait, okay.

4293
03:08:47,800 --> 03:08:52,200
Oh, I was like- I didn't realize I was- Where are we?

4294
03:08:52,260 --> 03:08:54,300
Is this a fact- What factory are we in?

4295
03:08:55,200 --> 03:08:56,640
Yeah, what does that say?

4296
03:08:56,900 --> 03:08:58,360
Where's- What?

4297
03:08:59,180 --> 03:09:00,120
No, get over here.

4298
03:09:00,120 --> 03:09:05,100
No, this is- Get over, get over, get over, get over, get over, get over, get over, get here.

4299
03:09:05,220 --> 03:09:05,960
We're not here to read.

4300
03:09:06,040 --> 03:09:06,640
We're here to die.

4301
03:09:06,800 --> 03:09:07,500
We're not here- AHH!

4302
03:09:08,520 --> 03:09:09,600
Man, that's what I thought.

4303
03:09:10,300 --> 03:09:11,200
You did this.

4304
03:09:11,460 --> 03:09:12,280
You did that on purpose.

4305
03:09:12,400 --> 03:09:14,020
I bet you wanted me to die like that.

4306
03:09:17,080 --> 03:09:21,040
Wait, how do we- Oh.

4307
03:09:22,140 --> 03:09:22,500
Okay.

4308
03:09:23,160 --> 03:09:24,780
Do you memorize how this was gonna go?

4309
03:09:27,660 --> 03:09:28,020
Okay.

4310
03:09:30,120 --> 03:09:30,840
We're doing it.

4311
03:09:33,320 --> 03:09:35,860
There's electricity below us, so don't get electrocuted.

4312
03:09:37,280 --> 03:09:37,760
Huh?

4313
03:09:38,880 --> 03:09:41,720
Why were you so silent when I said I bet you wanted that to happen?

4314
03:09:42,000 --> 03:09:43,820
Why were you so silent after that, huh?

4315
03:09:44,520 --> 03:09:46,620
Why were you silent when you said that?

4316
03:09:46,960 --> 03:09:47,800
When I said that, huh?

4317
03:09:50,700 --> 03:09:53,500
This is why black widows exist.

4318
03:09:59,380 --> 03:10:00,420
Oh, dang it.

4319
03:10:00,980 --> 03:10:02,260
Oh, oh.

4320
03:10:07,860 --> 03:10:08,560
Again?

4321
03:10:15,500 --> 03:10:16,200
Please.

4322
03:10:17,820 --> 03:10:18,600
Please.

4323
03:10:24,800 --> 03:10:25,280
Please.

4324
03:10:26,080 --> 03:10:30,940
Please, we were able to do this before.

4325
03:10:31,240 --> 03:10:33,060
How did you- How did you forget?

4326
03:10:33,780 --> 03:10:34,260
No!

4327
03:10:34,620 --> 03:10:36,140
No, my god.

4328
03:10:38,200 --> 03:10:38,680
Okay.

4329
03:10:43,240 --> 03:10:45,600
Okay, we have to do it instantly.

4330
03:10:45,720 --> 03:10:46,800
We have to do it instantly.

4331
03:10:47,300 --> 03:10:48,360
Okay, like right now.

4332
03:10:48,360 --> 03:10:49,000
Like right now.

4333
03:10:49,040 --> 03:10:50,040
Okay, there we go.

4334
03:10:51,120 --> 03:10:51,480
What?

4335
03:10:53,300 --> 03:10:56,300
Oh my god, are you fucking serious?

4336
03:10:56,880 --> 03:10:59,140
What are you doing?

4337
03:10:59,240 --> 03:11:00,200
What are you doing?

4338
03:11:02,520 --> 03:11:02,880
Okay,

4339
03:11:10,920 --> 03:11:11,640
I'll wait for you.

4340
03:11:16,160 --> 03:11:16,740
No, no.

4341
03:11:16,820 --> 03:11:17,480
Don't do this to me.

4342
03:11:17,520 --> 03:11:18,440
Don't do this to me yet.

4343
03:11:21,000 --> 03:11:21,360
Okay.

4344
03:11:24,180 --> 03:11:25,060
Are you ready?

4345
03:11:25,800 --> 03:11:26,440
You ready?

4346
03:11:26,720 --> 03:11:27,340
You ready?

4347
03:11:27,600 --> 03:11:28,900
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

4348
03:11:32,680 --> 03:11:34,620
Come on, get tissue paper right now.

4349
03:11:34,680 --> 03:11:35,200
Wipe your hands.

4350
03:11:36,540 --> 03:11:38,220
We still have two more chapters.

4351
03:11:38,760 --> 03:11:41,120
We still have two more- Get tissue papers right now.

4352
03:11:41,440 --> 03:11:42,540
Wipe- get a towel.

4353
03:11:42,680 --> 03:11:43,960
Wipe your hands right now.

4354
03:11:44,260 --> 03:11:44,780
I'll pull you.

4355
03:11:44,880 --> 03:11:45,760
You go get a towel.

4356
03:11:45,880 --> 03:11:46,560
I'm gonna pull you.

4357
03:11:46,880 --> 03:11:49,620
You go get a- Oh my- you go get a towel.

4358
03:11:50,740 --> 03:11:51,780
I need to go pee.

4359
03:11:52,140 --> 03:11:53,100
Oh my god.

4360
03:11:55,120 --> 03:11:57,140
Get- get inside, get inside, get- Okay.

4361
03:11:57,480 --> 03:11:58,040
Go pee.

4362
03:11:58,440 --> 03:11:58,940
Go pee.

4363
03:11:59,120 --> 03:12:00,240
Go pee right now.

4364
03:12:02,440 --> 03:12:03,340
Go pee.

4365
03:12:03,700 --> 03:12:05,500
Go pee right now.

4366
03:12:07,300 --> 03:12:08,820
Oh my god.

4367
03:12:09,620 --> 03:12:11,400
Guys, we're gonna complete this.

4368
03:12:11,760 --> 03:12:15,720
We're gonna do this.

4369
03:12:16,740 --> 03:12:20,080
If it's the last thing I do, if it's the last.

4370
03:12:21,180 --> 03:12:22,320
Oh no.

4371
03:12:22,520 --> 03:12:23,260
Oh no.

4372
03:12:23,260 --> 03:12:23,940
Okay, okay.

4373
03:12:23,980 --> 03:12:25,140
She's still alive.

4374
03:12:26,780 --> 03:12:27,340
Okay.

4375
03:12:29,100 --> 03:12:29,660
Okay.

4376
03:12:30,640 --> 03:12:31,740
Jesus Christ.

4377
03:12:31,800 --> 03:12:33,420
I'm gaming so hard right now.

4378
03:12:36,920 --> 03:12:38,400
We're literally at the end.

4379
03:12:39,580 --> 03:12:40,760
Oh my god.

4380
03:12:40,800 --> 03:12:41,880
Okay, how do we do this?

4381
03:12:42,520 --> 03:12:43,920
Oh, now I actually need her.

4382
03:12:44,120 --> 03:12:45,160
God damn it.

4383
03:12:45,200 --> 03:12:46,580
I actually need her now.

4384
03:12:47,820 --> 03:12:48,380
Okay.

4385
03:12:49,340 --> 03:12:51,040
Oh, I don't need her.

4386
03:12:51,340 --> 03:12:51,980
Wait a minute.

4387
03:12:51,980 --> 03:12:53,300
I actually don't need her.

4388
03:12:53,440 --> 03:12:54,520
Let's fucking go.

4389
03:12:54,940 --> 03:13:00,840
Let's- Okay, how do we- Alright.

4390
03:13:06,890 --> 03:13:08,590
Wait, how do we do this?

4391
03:13:12,320 --> 03:13:12,820
Oh!

4392
03:13:14,740 --> 03:13:15,660
There we go.

4393
03:13:16,580 --> 03:13:17,380
I didn't need her.

4394
03:13:18,720 --> 03:13:20,480
I did not need her at all.

4395
03:13:23,920 --> 03:13:25,200
Let's fucking go.

4396
03:13:27,400 --> 03:13:31,420
Wait, how do I- I don't untie this though.

4397
03:13:32,120 --> 03:13:33,720
Wait, how do you untie stuff?

4398
03:13:34,060 --> 03:13:34,660
Wait, no.

4399
03:13:34,740 --> 03:13:35,200
I need her.

4400
03:13:35,820 --> 03:13:37,980
Okay, that goes here.

4401
03:13:39,480 --> 03:13:39,960
Okay.

4402
03:13:41,540 --> 03:13:42,400
Oh, okay.

4403
03:13:42,560 --> 03:13:43,480
I figured it out.

4404
03:13:50,910 --> 03:13:51,930
Okay, I need her.

4405
03:13:52,570 --> 03:13:53,370
Oh, wait.

4406
03:13:53,470 --> 03:13:54,790
Wait, unless- Oh, I know.

4407
03:13:54,850 --> 03:13:55,250
I know.

4408
03:13:55,790 --> 03:13:56,350
Okay, we...

4409
03:13:59,960 --> 03:14:00,440
Okay.

4410
03:14:00,900 --> 03:14:01,660
Oh my god!

4411
03:14:01,680 --> 03:14:05,500
How is she still- How is she still- Oh my god!

4412
03:14:05,520 --> 03:14:05,760
Okay.

4413
03:14:06,000 --> 03:14:06,960
I don't need her.

4414
03:14:08,400 --> 03:14:09,580
I don't need her.

4415
03:14:11,740 --> 03:14:14,600
I shall so- Oh, fuck.

4416
03:14:14,720 --> 03:14:15,740
Okay, I figured it out.

4417
03:14:15,940 --> 03:14:17,300
I figured out the pattern.

4418
03:14:17,960 --> 03:14:18,280
This.

4419
03:14:18,760 --> 03:14:19,840
This first.

4420
03:14:20,600 --> 03:14:21,500
Then this.

4421
03:14:24,060 --> 03:14:25,200
I don't need her.

4422
03:14:25,500 --> 03:14:26,580
I don't need anybody.

4423
03:14:26,780 --> 03:14:28,600
This is a solo mission right here.

4424
03:14:30,220 --> 03:14:31,580
Oh my god.

4425
03:14:32,980 --> 03:14:35,060
This is so stupid.

4426
03:14:35,560 --> 03:14:35,960
No!

4427
03:14:37,120 --> 03:14:38,820
Oh my god!

4428
03:14:39,840 --> 03:14:40,600
Come here!

4429
03:14:41,240 --> 03:14:41,840
Come here!

4430
03:14:41,840 --> 03:14:42,300
I'm back!

4431
03:14:42,500 --> 03:14:43,940
You fucker!

4432
03:14:44,340 --> 03:14:45,240
Come here!

4433
03:14:47,660 --> 03:14:48,700
I had you!

4434
03:14:49,100 --> 03:14:49,580
I had you!

4435
03:14:49,580 --> 03:14:49,740
I'm back!

4436
03:14:50,200 --> 03:14:51,620
I had a sister!

4437
03:14:54,500 --> 03:14:55,660
Of course!

4438
03:14:55,780 --> 03:14:58,180
Of course you threw my bee here!

4439
03:14:58,560 --> 03:14:59,820
Of fucking course!

4440
03:15:00,360 --> 03:15:03,700
Of fucking course you threw- I've been back for like two minutes.

4441
03:15:04,520 --> 03:15:10,700
Of fucking course- Look, I saved you!

4442
03:15:14,060 --> 03:15:16,280
I had a sister!

4443
03:15:17,020 --> 03:15:20,040
I can't- I can't believe it.

4444
03:15:22,320 --> 03:15:23,480
Look, I saved you.

4445
03:15:25,000 --> 03:15:28,780
I figured out the entire system.

4446
03:15:29,400 --> 03:15:31,300
And you just come back.

4447
03:15:31,300 --> 03:15:33,540
Just to fuck me over.

4448
03:15:34,060 --> 03:15:35,320
Look, I saved you again.

4449
03:15:35,540 --> 03:15:36,160
Oh my god.

4450
03:15:36,220 --> 03:15:38,180
God, seeing you is better than real you.

4451
03:15:39,940 --> 03:15:44,100
The funniest part is I think I've been back for a whole minute and a half watching you do it.

4452
03:15:49,120 --> 03:15:50,320
Oh my god, we did it!

4453
03:15:50,360 --> 03:15:51,240
We saved me!

4454
03:15:51,320 --> 03:15:53,140
At least I saved myself.

4455
03:15:54,580 --> 03:15:56,460
What the- There was another character in there.

4456
03:15:59,420 --> 03:16:00,480
Here we go.

4457
03:16:02,140 --> 03:16:03,280
Okay, we gotta go.

4458
03:16:03,420 --> 03:16:03,720
We gotta go.

4459
03:16:03,780 --> 03:16:04,640
I think it's gonna explode.

4460
03:16:04,760 --> 03:16:05,780
I think it's gonna explode.

4461
03:16:05,920 --> 03:16:06,940
We gotta go fast.

4462
03:16:07,460 --> 03:16:08,240
Oh yeah.

4463
03:16:08,540 --> 03:16:09,920
Goodbye, I killed you first.

4464
03:16:10,060 --> 03:16:10,680
Thank god.

4465
03:16:12,760 --> 03:16:15,800
No, you're pink!

4466
03:16:15,880 --> 03:16:16,480
I'm yellow!

4467
03:16:19,260 --> 03:16:20,360
How do we get down?

4468
03:16:20,680 --> 03:16:21,040
Oh here.

4469
03:16:22,540 --> 03:16:23,460
That's fucking right.

4470
03:16:23,720 --> 03:16:25,340
I'll problem solve for us.

4471
03:16:26,140 --> 03:16:26,980
I died last.

4472
03:16:27,060 --> 03:16:27,400
Finally.

4473
03:16:29,720 --> 03:16:32,820
It's not like I literally problem solved the last puzzle.

4474
03:16:35,920 --> 03:16:36,320
Run.

4475
03:16:36,800 --> 03:16:37,200
Run.

4476
03:16:37,280 --> 03:16:37,840
We gotta run.

4477
03:16:37,920 --> 03:16:38,660
We gotta run.

4478
03:16:39,480 --> 03:16:41,240
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

4479
03:16:41,300 --> 03:16:41,780
Oh, he's here.

4480
03:16:41,800 --> 03:16:42,100
He's here.

4481
03:16:42,160 --> 03:16:42,760
He's gonna touch you.

4482
03:16:42,820 --> 03:16:43,640
He's gonna touch your butt.

4483
03:16:43,660 --> 03:16:44,280
He's gonna do it.

4484
03:16:44,280 --> 03:16:45,560
He's gonna touch your butt right here.

4485
03:16:45,800 --> 03:16:46,040
Right there.

4486
03:16:46,300 --> 03:16:46,680
Right here.

4487
03:16:49,340 --> 03:16:50,420
What the fuck?

4488
03:16:51,060 --> 03:16:52,760
No, my hands are too cold.

4489
03:16:53,100 --> 03:16:54,260
What the fuck?

4490
03:16:57,740 --> 03:16:58,840
He's coming to get you.

4491
03:16:58,980 --> 03:16:59,720
He's gonna get you.

4492
03:16:59,800 --> 03:17:00,880
He's gonna get you.

4493
03:17:03,720 --> 03:17:06,720
Oh, no.

4494
03:17:06,840 --> 03:17:07,140
Look at that.

4495
03:17:07,280 --> 03:17:07,480
Look at that.

4496
03:17:07,560 --> 03:17:08,120
He's right there on your butt.

4497
03:17:08,220 --> 03:17:08,600
Right on your butt.

4498
03:17:08,640 --> 03:17:09,300
He's gonna poke you.

4499
03:17:09,380 --> 03:17:10,280
He's gonna be like...

4500
03:17:10,280 --> 03:17:10,640
Whoah!

4501
03:17:15,120 --> 03:17:15,360
Yeah.

4502
03:17:16,240 --> 03:17:16,600
And...

4503
03:17:16,600 --> 03:17:17,100
Oh, oh.

4504
03:17:17,260 --> 03:17:19,760
You slammed it to the wall.

4505
03:17:20,480 --> 03:17:23,840
I literally saw you slam it to the fucking wall.

4506
03:17:23,840 --> 03:17:24,560
Okay.

4507
03:17:28,200 --> 03:17:28,920
Get over here.

4508
03:17:28,980 --> 03:17:29,340
Get over here.

4509
03:17:29,340 --> 03:17:29,920
I'm gonna pull you.

4510
03:17:30,020 --> 03:17:30,720
Get over here.

4511
03:17:31,420 --> 03:17:32,960
Get over here, Gumi.

4512
03:17:33,540 --> 03:17:35,280
Get your ass over here.

4513
03:17:35,900 --> 03:17:37,100
Look, I saved you.

4514
03:17:37,460 --> 03:17:39,400
You did not save shit.

4515
03:17:40,280 --> 03:17:41,160
He's like...

4516
03:17:43,480 --> 03:17:44,360
Oh, my God.

4517
03:17:44,540 --> 03:17:45,620
Why did I follow you?

4518
03:17:45,720 --> 03:17:47,380
You should have been back at your parents' house.

4519
03:17:48,580 --> 03:17:49,640
I ran away for you.

4520
03:17:49,660 --> 03:17:50,520
Oh, my God.

4521
03:17:51,640 --> 03:17:52,260
What's going on?

4522
03:17:52,280 --> 03:17:53,240
What is the lore?

4523
03:17:53,840 --> 03:17:54,220
I don't know.

4524
03:17:54,360 --> 03:17:56,480
If you got your shiny thing, we'll figure out the lore.

4525
03:18:00,560 --> 03:18:02,120
Oh, it's this again.

4526
03:18:02,760 --> 03:18:03,460
Don't worry.

4527
03:18:03,560 --> 03:18:04,760
I did all of this before.

4528
03:18:08,540 --> 03:18:09,260
Okay, wait.

4529
03:18:09,380 --> 03:18:10,100
I fucked it up.

4530
03:18:12,340 --> 03:18:12,860
Okay.

4531
03:18:13,480 --> 03:18:14,420
This does that.

4532
03:18:17,540 --> 03:18:18,060
Okay.

4533
03:18:18,980 --> 03:18:19,820
There you go.

4534
03:18:19,960 --> 03:18:20,760
You're fucking welcome.

4535
03:18:22,540 --> 03:18:23,060
Ow.

4536
03:18:23,400 --> 03:18:24,360
Why did you...

4537
03:18:24,360 --> 03:18:25,900
Why did...

4538
03:18:25,900 --> 03:18:27,380
I thought I was gonna pull you up.

4539
03:18:29,640 --> 03:18:31,260
I was waiting to pull you up.

4540
03:18:31,320 --> 03:18:33,420
No, no, we gotta be like...

4541
03:18:45,740 --> 03:18:47,860
Who the hell is messaging me?

4542
03:18:48,700 --> 03:18:50,080
They're not important because it's not me.

4543
03:18:52,700 --> 03:18:53,100
Okay.

4544
03:18:53,640 --> 03:18:54,340
Okay, don't...

4545
03:18:54,880 --> 03:18:56,040
I need to look at the...

4546
03:18:56,980 --> 03:18:58,660
Okay, this would be the last one.

4547
03:18:58,700 --> 03:18:59,400
I have to pull up.

4548
03:18:59,600 --> 03:19:00,260
Okay, and then...

4549
03:19:01,120 --> 03:19:02,100
Don't go anywhere.

4550
03:19:02,180 --> 03:19:02,740
Don't go anywhere.

4551
03:19:02,860 --> 03:19:03,360
Don't go anywhere.

4552
03:19:03,560 --> 03:19:04,360
I'm just saying.

4553
03:19:04,500 --> 03:19:05,080
Okay, this one.

4554
03:19:05,260 --> 03:19:05,400
Okay.

4555
03:19:06,980 --> 03:19:07,380
All right.

4556
03:19:08,240 --> 03:19:08,920
All right, let's do it.

4557
03:19:09,880 --> 03:19:10,500
All right.

4558
03:19:13,240 --> 03:19:13,840
Get it.

4559
03:19:14,980 --> 03:19:15,580
There we go.

4560
03:19:15,740 --> 03:19:16,000
See?

4561
03:19:16,180 --> 03:19:16,540
That...

4562
03:19:16,540 --> 03:19:16,980
There you go.

4563
03:19:17,020 --> 03:19:17,460
You're welcome.

4564
03:19:19,740 --> 03:19:22,220
That's what I was doing while you're in the bathroom.

4565
03:19:24,800 --> 03:19:26,440
Dude, I finished peeing really fast.

4566
03:19:26,500 --> 03:19:28,240
It's just I was talking to Kazu.

4567
03:19:28,380 --> 03:19:28,660
Oh my...

4568
03:19:29,540 --> 03:19:30,180
Bring Kazu!

4569
03:19:30,340 --> 03:19:31,140
You can talk to Kazu!

4570
03:19:31,180 --> 03:19:31,720
Oh, that's us.

4571
03:19:32,040 --> 03:19:33,800
You talk to Kazu while we're playing.

4572
03:19:34,240 --> 03:19:34,700
I'm tagging out.

4573
03:19:34,720 --> 03:19:35,520
No, he ran downstairs.

4574
03:19:39,900 --> 03:19:41,060
Could have been the host.

4575
03:19:41,140 --> 03:19:41,860
You could have been the host.

4576
03:19:42,040 --> 03:19:42,980
You could have been the host.

4577
03:19:43,240 --> 03:19:44,100
That's all I'm saying.

4578
03:19:51,420 --> 03:19:52,660
Wait, what are you doing?

4579
03:19:55,900 --> 03:19:56,540
Oh, wait.

4580
03:19:57,200 --> 03:19:58,380
Yeah, what are you doing?

4581
03:19:59,600 --> 03:20:00,380
What are you doing?

4582
03:20:00,520 --> 03:20:00,660
It's this way.

4583
03:20:00,660 --> 03:20:01,240
I hate you.

4584
03:20:01,560 --> 03:20:02,200
I hate you.

4585
03:20:10,120 --> 03:20:11,980
I don't know what she was doing, chat.

4586
03:20:17,970 --> 03:20:19,650
We did a parkour!

4587
03:20:21,770 --> 03:20:23,770
I don't even know how this machine works!

4588
03:20:27,750 --> 03:20:28,850
That's so dangerous.

4589
03:20:28,970 --> 03:20:29,810
Holy shit.

4590
03:20:31,770 --> 03:20:32,250
Be free!

4591
03:20:32,770 --> 03:20:34,310
Go back to your people!

4592
03:20:35,390 --> 03:20:36,110
Be free!

4593
03:20:37,430 --> 03:20:39,670
And they're like, damn, I should have stayed home.

4594
03:20:39,930 --> 03:20:40,930
I miss my mom.

4595
03:20:41,470 --> 03:20:42,650
Oh, they're beefing!

4596
03:20:43,390 --> 03:20:43,690
Yeah!

4597
03:20:44,390 --> 03:20:46,470
Oh my god, finally it feels real.

4598
03:20:49,410 --> 03:20:50,390
Let's go.

4599
03:20:54,210 --> 03:20:56,930
Apparently, forklifts weigh more than a car?

4600
03:20:58,110 --> 03:20:59,410
Jeez, that's crazy.

4601
03:20:59,510 --> 03:21:00,090
I didn't know that.

4602
03:21:03,270 --> 03:21:05,670
Finally, this game is relatable now.

4603
03:21:08,510 --> 03:21:09,790
What chapter are we on?

4604
03:21:10,430 --> 03:21:11,550
We finished chapter five?

4605
03:21:12,790 --> 03:21:14,590
I've lost track, we've done so many.

4606
03:21:18,030 --> 03:21:19,910
Oh no, our friendship is broken!

4607
03:21:20,070 --> 03:21:20,810
You see that?

4608
03:21:23,750 --> 03:21:25,670
Listen, we had a good run.

4609
03:21:25,690 --> 03:21:26,610
It's broken now!

4610
03:21:35,030 --> 03:21:36,290
I think we had a good run.

4611
03:21:36,730 --> 03:21:37,950
I think we had a good run.

4612
03:21:39,870 --> 03:21:40,270
Look!

4613
03:21:41,410 --> 03:21:42,210
I tried...

4614
03:21:42,210 --> 03:21:45,070
I was stuck, you tried to save me, and then I hated you.

4615
03:21:45,730 --> 03:21:46,670
No, you were stuck.

4616
03:21:46,770 --> 03:21:47,550
The pink is stuck.

4617
03:21:48,290 --> 03:21:48,970
Is pink stuck?

4618
03:21:49,170 --> 03:21:49,470
Yeah.

4619
03:21:50,270 --> 03:21:50,670
See?

4620
03:21:54,870 --> 03:21:58,550
Well, I guess we'll never know the rest of that story, because we're not doing that again.

4621
03:22:00,570 --> 03:22:01,370
Do you think we're gonna get a new friend?

4622
03:22:01,370 --> 03:22:03,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4623
03:22:03,690 --> 03:22:04,790
I think we're at chapter...

4624
03:22:04,790 --> 03:22:05,910
Are we at chapter five?

4625
03:22:06,010 --> 03:22:06,270
What's that?

4626
03:22:06,290 --> 03:22:07,030
What's B1?

4627
03:22:08,910 --> 03:22:09,730
What's B1?

4628
03:22:10,130 --> 03:22:10,710
That's six?

4629
03:22:10,910 --> 03:22:11,350
We're at six.

4630
03:22:11,450 --> 03:22:12,170
Five is B.

4631
03:22:12,590 --> 03:22:13,770
Oh my god, we're almost there.

4632
03:22:14,810 --> 03:22:15,250
See?

4633
03:22:15,330 --> 03:22:16,130
We compliment each other.

4634
03:22:16,210 --> 03:22:17,790
I don't know roman numerals, you don't...

4635
03:22:17,790 --> 03:22:18,910
You know roman numerals.

4636
03:22:19,850 --> 03:22:20,550
Oh my god, stop.

4637
03:22:20,610 --> 03:22:21,830
Stop, stop, stop!

4638
03:22:21,890 --> 03:22:22,850
Stop picking the shiny!

4639
03:22:23,590 --> 03:22:23,870
Stop!

4640
03:22:25,010 --> 03:22:29,090
Stop, you picked up five shinies already!

4641
03:22:31,250 --> 03:22:32,130
Okay, and...

4642
03:22:32,690 --> 03:22:34,270
Why are we back in the woods?

4643
03:22:34,650 --> 03:22:35,830
Because we escaped the factory.

4644
03:22:36,450 --> 03:22:38,510
We were only in the factory because we got kidnapped.

4645
03:22:40,230 --> 03:22:42,250
Also, does that mean they went through the swamp?

4646
03:22:42,990 --> 03:22:43,810
I guess so.

4647
03:22:44,070 --> 03:22:44,370
Yeah.

4648
03:22:45,770 --> 03:22:46,210
Oh.

4649
03:22:47,350 --> 03:22:48,890
Tie it, and I think we pull it up.

4650
03:22:51,570 --> 03:22:52,510
And then you can...

4651
03:22:54,050 --> 03:22:55,070
Look, there's a shiny.

4652
03:22:56,410 --> 03:22:56,810
Where?

4653
03:23:01,950 --> 03:23:03,650
There's a shiny right there.

4654
03:23:05,110 --> 03:23:06,510
And then you pull up, you pull up, you...

4655
03:23:06,510 --> 03:23:08,470
You climb up, you climb up to the very top.

4656
03:23:08,790 --> 03:23:10,870
You climb up, you climb up.

4657
03:23:11,130 --> 03:23:11,490
Yes.

4658
03:23:12,310 --> 03:23:12,670
Yes.

4659
03:23:14,490 --> 03:23:16,690
Yes, and then you keep climbing.

4660
03:23:17,210 --> 03:23:18,230
Go back a little, go back a little.

4661
03:23:18,510 --> 03:23:19,130
Go back a little.

4662
03:23:19,510 --> 03:23:20,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4663
03:23:20,810 --> 03:23:22,810
You get one try, you get one try, you get one try.

4664
03:23:22,930 --> 03:23:23,830
There you go, yeah.

4665
03:23:24,570 --> 03:23:25,490
Is that what you wanted?

4666
03:23:25,930 --> 03:23:26,990
Is that what you wanted?

4667
03:23:27,570 --> 03:23:28,450
All right, now do...

4668
03:23:28,450 --> 03:23:29,430
Okay, okay.

4669
03:23:32,410 --> 03:23:33,190
There you go.

4670
03:23:35,390 --> 03:23:36,470
Everybody gets one.

4671
03:23:43,910 --> 03:23:46,090
Wall... Mog... Mog mortars.

4672
03:23:49,230 --> 03:23:49,670
Okay.

4673
03:23:50,410 --> 03:23:51,390
Here, jump.

4674
03:23:51,570 --> 03:23:52,410
Do the jumpies.

4675
03:23:53,370 --> 03:23:54,570
How do I do the wall jumpies?

4676
03:23:54,650 --> 03:23:55,650
The wall jumpies on the left.

4677
03:23:55,650 --> 03:23:56,390
I need to get up.

4678
03:23:56,430 --> 03:23:57,430
I need to get up first.

4679
03:23:57,970 --> 03:23:59,090
On the left.

4680
03:23:59,910 --> 03:24:01,250
Okay, you do it.

4681
03:24:01,670 --> 03:24:02,110
Okay.

4682
03:24:03,190 --> 03:24:04,690
JK, I don't need it.

4683
03:24:05,310 --> 03:24:05,820
What the...

4684
03:24:12,770 --> 03:24:13,950
Don't I still need to pull it down?

4685
03:24:13,950 --> 03:24:14,900
Wait, wait, I think...

4686
03:24:15,590 --> 03:24:16,960
Yeah, I pull it down and then...

4687
03:24:21,830 --> 03:24:22,990
Okay, I'll do it again.

4688
03:24:28,940 --> 03:24:29,440
What?

4689
03:24:30,220 --> 03:24:31,860
I think I have to pull it.

4690
03:24:32,000 --> 03:24:32,640
No, I have to.

4691
03:24:32,700 --> 03:24:33,860
No, I have to pull it.

4692
03:24:33,900 --> 03:24:34,380
Do I not?

4693
03:24:36,700 --> 03:24:38,020
No, it's my side.

4694
03:24:39,520 --> 03:24:40,740
I'm pretty sure, right?

4695
03:24:43,080 --> 03:24:43,840
You have to get off.

4696
03:24:43,860 --> 03:24:45,280
You have to get off the thing, I think.

4697
03:24:45,940 --> 03:24:46,200
Right?

4698
03:24:47,420 --> 03:24:48,500
No, that doesn't make sense.

4699
03:24:48,540 --> 03:24:50,060
If I get off, then I can't get up.

4700
03:24:50,860 --> 03:24:51,680
Unless you... Okay.

4701
03:24:53,760 --> 03:24:54,780
Yeah, yeah, see?

4702
03:24:55,860 --> 03:24:56,540
It's all right.

4703
03:24:58,000 --> 03:24:59,180
Did you tie it?

4704
03:24:59,820 --> 03:24:59,920
Yeah.

4705
03:25:01,200 --> 03:25:02,160
We had to tie it.

4706
03:25:02,320 --> 03:25:02,740
It's okay.

4707
03:25:02,820 --> 03:25:03,680
We can't all be special.

4708
03:25:05,760 --> 03:25:06,920
Yeah, we all can't.

4709
03:25:09,780 --> 03:25:11,240
I do not look like Pikmin.

4710
03:25:14,640 --> 03:25:16,080
How come you don't want me to...

4711
03:25:16,080 --> 03:25:17,640
That's why you get a good little star for today.

4712
03:25:17,900 --> 03:25:18,400
You know what?

4713
03:25:18,700 --> 03:25:18,720
Shut up.

4714
03:25:18,720 --> 03:25:19,300
This cuts in time.

4715
03:25:19,840 --> 03:25:20,260
It's my turn.

4716
03:25:20,460 --> 03:25:20,940
Look, I pissed at you.

4717
03:25:22,040 --> 03:25:23,800
Hey, I let you...

4718
03:25:23,800 --> 03:25:25,680
I carried you through that last puzzle.

4719
03:25:25,760 --> 03:25:26,260
It's my turn.

4720
03:25:26,360 --> 03:25:26,520
It's my turn.

4721
03:25:26,520 --> 03:25:27,280
What?

4722
03:25:27,380 --> 03:25:27,940
Are you going pee?

4723
03:25:28,080 --> 03:25:28,640
Are you going pee?

4724
03:25:29,160 --> 03:25:29,980
Yeah, I'm gonna go pee.

4725
03:25:31,000 --> 03:25:31,440
Okay.

4726
03:25:41,060 --> 03:25:43,160
I see your Fuki moving.

4727
03:25:44,960 --> 03:25:46,080
Why is it moving?

4728
03:25:49,630 --> 03:25:51,170
Yeah, she can figure it out in a sec.

4729
03:26:07,430 --> 03:26:08,690
How do I get the shiny?

4730
03:26:14,150 --> 03:26:15,770
I know she's probably there.

4731
03:26:23,850 --> 03:26:26,950
Let me go through my photos and see which one I like the most.

4732
03:26:27,430 --> 03:26:28,110
All right, I'm back.

4733
03:26:28,670 --> 03:26:29,490
Why am I here?

4734
03:26:29,810 --> 03:26:30,530
Why am I here?

4735
03:26:31,430 --> 03:26:31,750
Huh?

4736
03:26:31,930 --> 03:26:32,750
Why am I here?

4737
03:26:32,930 --> 03:26:34,750
Why do I not carry me through this?

4738
03:26:35,530 --> 03:26:36,850
Well, because I knew you've been there.

4739
03:26:37,010 --> 03:26:37,550
What do you mean?

4740
03:26:37,610 --> 03:26:38,470
I just got back.

4741
03:26:38,750 --> 03:26:39,270
I went to the bathroom.

4742
03:26:39,550 --> 03:26:41,070
I saw your Fuki moving the entire time.

4743
03:26:41,090 --> 03:26:41,770
No, I muted it.

4744
03:26:41,970 --> 03:26:42,990
Yeah, and I muted myself.

4745
03:26:43,670 --> 03:26:44,810
So I could use the bathroom.

4746
03:26:45,670 --> 03:26:48,330
If you muted the Fuki, it wouldn't move, you freak.

4747
03:26:48,490 --> 03:26:49,010
What do you mean?

4748
03:26:50,570 --> 03:26:51,650
I muted myself.

4749
03:26:51,750 --> 03:26:52,630
What are you talking about?

4750
03:26:53,730 --> 03:26:54,190
Who the fuck...

4751
03:26:54,190 --> 03:26:56,070
Of course, I always mute myself when I use the bathroom.

4752
03:26:59,980 --> 03:27:02,460
Hey, I'm pretty sure this is like a time-sensitive level.

4753
03:27:02,960 --> 03:27:03,680
I'm pretty sure I...

4754
03:27:03,680 --> 03:27:04,220
Oh, yeah.

4755
03:27:05,080 --> 03:27:06,660
Hey, hey, um...

4756
03:27:06,660 --> 03:27:08,000
Should we be worried about that?

4757
03:27:09,140 --> 03:27:09,800
I don't know.

4758
03:27:10,020 --> 03:27:11,700
I'm pretty sure you have to go the other way.

4759
03:27:13,980 --> 03:27:15,420
I'm pretty sure you gotta tie that.

4760
03:27:16,920 --> 03:27:17,880
Hey, I think we're gonna burn.

4761
03:27:18,400 --> 03:27:19,180
I think we're gonna burn.

4762
03:27:19,280 --> 03:27:19,880
I think we're gonna burn.

4763
03:27:19,980 --> 03:27:20,620
I think we're gonna burn.

4764
03:27:20,720 --> 03:27:21,520
I think we're gonna...

4765
03:27:21,900 --> 03:27:23,540
Because I tied it, then what?

4766
03:27:23,860 --> 03:27:24,740
You didn't tie it.

4767
03:27:24,780 --> 03:27:25,300
No, you didn't.

4768
03:27:25,320 --> 03:27:25,680
Look.

4769
03:27:26,280 --> 03:27:27,080
Tied to what?

4770
03:27:27,320 --> 03:27:27,680
This.

4771
03:27:29,340 --> 03:27:30,800
Do you not see the loop on it?

4772
03:27:30,880 --> 03:27:31,840
That's a pink loop.

4773
03:27:32,240 --> 03:27:33,260
No, that's a yellow loop.

4774
03:27:34,240 --> 03:27:34,600
What?

4775
03:27:36,440 --> 03:27:37,400
You untied it!

4776
03:27:37,480 --> 03:27:38,560
You untied it!

4777
03:27:42,710 --> 03:27:44,470
Oh my god, I'm pretty sure I did.

4778
03:27:44,850 --> 03:27:45,870
Oh my god.

4779
03:27:46,170 --> 03:27:48,150
Oh my god, we might as well just fucking burn.

4780
03:27:48,270 --> 03:27:48,750
Look, here, here.

4781
03:27:48,830 --> 03:27:49,130
See, look.

4782
03:27:49,190 --> 03:27:49,870
I did it.

4783
03:27:53,370 --> 03:27:54,570
You're supposed to be on the other side.

4784
03:27:54,650 --> 03:27:55,930
You're supposed to be on the other side.

4785
03:27:56,710 --> 03:27:57,430
And then...

4786
03:27:59,550 --> 03:28:00,410
You know what?

4787
03:28:00,490 --> 03:28:00,890
I...

4788
03:28:00,890 --> 03:28:03,790
Because I'm selfless, I'll sacrifice myself for you.

4789
03:28:04,690 --> 03:28:05,990
Oh god bless, finally.

4790
03:28:09,210 --> 03:28:11,730
This has to be like the slowest fire though.

4791
03:28:14,170 --> 03:28:15,610
I'm pretty sure I just waited for it.

4792
03:28:15,670 --> 03:28:16,530
I think so too.

4793
03:28:16,570 --> 03:28:18,390
I think the fire was just like...

4794
03:28:18,390 --> 03:28:19,930
Any minute now, they go...

4795
03:28:21,910 --> 03:28:22,390
Huh?

4796
03:28:22,730 --> 03:28:23,590
Oh, wow.

4797
03:28:23,930 --> 03:28:27,170
I see you're not here to sacrifice yourself for the greater good.

4798
03:28:27,810 --> 03:28:29,150
I didn't think I needed to.

4799
03:28:29,430 --> 03:28:30,510
Oh, okay.

4800
03:28:30,790 --> 03:28:31,190
You're right.

4801
03:28:31,470 --> 03:28:32,510
I remember that.

4802
03:28:35,070 --> 03:28:35,590
Huh?

4803
03:28:36,270 --> 03:28:36,950
Oh, hey.

4804
03:28:41,990 --> 03:28:43,010
Yeah, whoa.

4805
03:28:43,270 --> 03:28:46,290
What happened?

4806
03:28:47,130 --> 03:28:47,810
What happened?

4807
03:28:48,270 --> 03:28:49,770
What happened over there, huh?

4808
03:28:50,290 --> 03:28:50,890
What happened?

4809
03:28:52,290 --> 03:28:54,010
Oh, I happened to risk four times.

4810
03:28:54,230 --> 03:28:54,870
Oh, what do you mean?

4811
03:28:55,630 --> 03:28:56,310
I don't know.

4812
03:28:56,610 --> 03:28:57,510
I feel like something happened.

4813
03:28:57,510 --> 03:28:58,090
Four times?

4814
03:28:58,230 --> 03:28:59,110
Are you talking about yourself?

4815
03:29:00,110 --> 03:29:03,090
No, I'm talking about something that I watched earlier.

4816
03:29:03,270 --> 03:29:04,010
What did you watch?

4817
03:29:04,190 --> 03:29:06,550
I was in the bathroom, so I don't know what you're talking about.

4818
03:29:10,170 --> 03:29:11,970
How are you supposed to do that?

4819
03:29:12,270 --> 03:29:12,510
Oh!

4820
03:29:13,370 --> 03:29:13,850
Oh!

4821
03:29:17,510 --> 03:29:18,550
We did it.

4822
03:29:22,570 --> 03:29:23,350
Wait, what?

4823
03:29:23,810 --> 03:29:25,450
Oh, we just need to jump higher.

4824
03:29:27,470 --> 03:29:29,350
Don't start forest fires, guys.

4825
03:29:31,570 --> 03:29:33,030
How did this fire start again?

4826
03:29:33,730 --> 03:29:34,230
I don't know.

4827
03:29:34,990 --> 03:29:36,330
I think it could be you.

4828
03:29:41,950 --> 03:29:44,910
It could be anybody, honestly, but it's definitely not me.

4829
03:29:47,270 --> 03:29:48,070
You mean it?

4830
03:29:48,610 --> 03:29:49,030
Yeah.

4831
03:29:49,670 --> 03:29:50,550
What's that rope for?

4832
03:29:50,670 --> 03:29:50,850
Oh.

4833
03:29:51,670 --> 03:29:52,810
Yeah, go down.

4834
03:29:54,290 --> 03:29:57,210
Oh, I didn't want to swing anymore, mom.

4835
03:29:57,910 --> 03:29:59,330
You are the best swinger.

4836
03:30:00,410 --> 03:30:02,270
I don't think you should say things like that.

4837
03:30:06,670 --> 03:30:08,310
Get up, get up.

4838
03:30:09,230 --> 03:30:10,750
You're the best swinger I know.

4839
03:30:11,210 --> 03:30:11,750
You know what?

4840
03:30:11,950 --> 03:30:12,690
I went on a cruise.

4841
03:30:13,430 --> 03:30:13,830
Yeah?

4842
03:30:15,650 --> 03:30:16,050
Anyways.

4843
03:30:16,530 --> 03:30:17,470
Oh, yeah, keep going.

4844
03:30:17,570 --> 03:30:17,970
Go away.

4845
03:30:18,050 --> 03:30:19,750
No, you got to stop that story there.

4846
03:30:20,030 --> 03:30:21,210
What's wrong with some of the story?

4847
03:30:21,890 --> 03:30:22,890
What did you do at the cruise?

4848
03:30:24,090 --> 03:30:26,690
I didn't do nothing, but I saw... I saw things.

4849
03:30:27,170 --> 03:30:27,710
Wait, what?

4850
03:30:27,970 --> 03:30:28,430
Wait, what?

4851
03:30:28,830 --> 03:30:30,750
Wait, isn't that Cruise of Minecrafters?

4852
03:30:31,490 --> 03:30:36,630
Yeah, but no, there's not only minecrafters on the like thousand people cruise line.

4853
03:30:37,050 --> 03:30:37,950
Oh, shit.

4854
03:30:38,170 --> 03:30:39,990
You mean there's non minecrafters?

4855
03:30:40,190 --> 03:30:42,670
No, there was a lot of old people who were also racist.

4856
03:30:43,170 --> 03:30:45,790
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

4857
03:30:45,790 --> 03:30:46,570
What do you mean by that?

4858
03:30:46,650 --> 03:30:47,630
What do you mean?

4859
03:30:49,070 --> 03:30:53,130
Wait, wait, what do you mean by what did you see other crews?

4860
03:30:53,650 --> 03:31:00,230
There were people with specific stickers that said they were down to swing, you know?

4861
03:31:00,830 --> 03:31:01,270
Oh.

4862
03:31:05,710 --> 03:31:10,290
So the minecrafters were in a swing cruise, is that what you're trying to say?

4863
03:31:12,030 --> 03:31:12,470
No.

4864
03:31:13,850 --> 03:31:16,030
Wait, yeah, people use stickers for that?

4865
03:31:16,770 --> 03:31:17,210
Yeah.

4866
03:31:18,410 --> 03:31:19,810
Let me... They're gonna touch us.

4867
03:31:21,850 --> 03:31:24,750
Oh my God, I keep falling, because I'm holding down.

4868
03:31:25,870 --> 03:31:27,350
The grass will keep me safe.

4869
03:31:27,990 --> 03:31:28,850
Wait, wait, stop, stop, stop.

4870
03:31:28,870 --> 03:31:30,350
I want to see if the grass keeps it safe.

4871
03:31:30,790 --> 03:31:32,570
It does, it does, it does.

4872
03:31:32,730 --> 03:31:33,090
Does it?

4873
03:31:33,210 --> 03:31:33,350
Yeah.

4874
03:31:33,350 --> 03:31:34,530
Does it actually not come all the way down?

4875
03:31:34,590 --> 03:31:36,850
No, it doesn't, because it's like they don't like to touch grass.

4876
03:31:39,010 --> 03:31:41,890
I told you this like three hours ago.

4877
03:31:51,860 --> 03:31:53,640
Look, see?

4878
03:31:54,860 --> 03:31:56,380
Oh, why did you activate that?

4879
03:31:56,500 --> 03:31:57,060
Why did you?

4880
03:31:57,400 --> 03:31:57,720
Why?

4881
03:31:58,060 --> 03:31:59,880
Gumi, why did you activate that?

4882
03:31:59,960 --> 03:32:00,220
Okay.

4883
03:32:00,780 --> 03:32:01,220
Stop!

4884
03:32:03,520 --> 03:32:05,440
Okay, we gotta do this fast.

4885
03:32:07,380 --> 03:32:08,580
Go, go, go, go, go.

4886
03:32:10,100 --> 03:32:10,360
Gumi.

4887
03:32:12,540 --> 03:32:13,100
Gumi!

4888
03:32:22,250 --> 03:32:23,490
I'm like, Gumi!

4889
03:32:24,050 --> 03:32:24,490
Gumi!

4890
03:32:27,450 --> 03:32:28,550
Get over here!

4891
03:32:28,790 --> 03:32:30,950
I'm like holding a fucking leash right now!

4892
03:32:31,230 --> 03:32:32,290
He has over here!

4893
03:32:35,530 --> 03:32:38,070
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

4894
03:32:38,110 --> 03:32:39,330
Doesn't he have a baby leash?

4895
03:32:41,570 --> 03:32:45,430
Yeah, you're a fucking... yeah, you're a big baby.

4896
03:32:47,670 --> 03:32:48,470
And I mean it.

4897
03:32:48,750 --> 03:32:48,910
Yeah.

4898
03:32:51,250 --> 03:32:51,690
Derogatory.

4899
03:32:52,610 --> 03:32:52,830
What?

4900
03:32:54,930 --> 03:32:55,870
What are you doing?

4901
03:32:56,150 --> 03:32:58,350
I have to climb up!

4902
03:33:03,410 --> 03:33:04,390
Look, it's on me.

4903
03:33:04,450 --> 03:33:05,370
It's on me now.

4904
03:33:06,210 --> 03:33:08,430
It's literally... yes, look, look, he's... okay.

4905
03:33:08,930 --> 03:33:12,430
Okay, now, now, whoa, whoa, whoa, now it's on me again!

4906
03:33:12,570 --> 03:33:14,510
Now, whoa, I'm saving your life!

4907
03:33:15,810 --> 03:33:17,250
I need you to bait it.

4908
03:33:29,170 --> 03:33:31,310
All right, I baited it, I baited it.

4909
03:33:32,170 --> 03:33:35,110
I'm baiting it, I'm heading over to bait it right now.

4910
03:33:35,190 --> 03:33:36,510
I'm baiting it, I'm baiting it.

4911
03:33:37,810 --> 03:33:39,270
All right, okay.

4912
03:33:41,550 --> 03:33:41,990
Okay.

4913
03:33:41,990 --> 03:33:43,510
Gumi, Gumi, Gumi, you didn't even bait it!

4914
03:33:43,550 --> 03:33:44,430
You didn't even bait it!

4915
03:33:45,730 --> 03:33:46,610
Why did you?

4916
03:33:46,790 --> 03:33:48,070
Why didn't you bait it?

4917
03:33:48,810 --> 03:33:51,010
I was wondering what you were doing down there.

4918
03:33:51,790 --> 03:33:52,650
Oh my god.

4919
03:33:52,970 --> 03:33:56,070
Oh my god, Gumi, you gotta wait!

4920
03:33:56,610 --> 03:33:58,090
You gotta be patient!

4921
03:33:59,170 --> 03:34:00,050
I'm impatient!

4922
03:34:00,390 --> 03:34:02,530
Okay, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right.

4923
03:34:02,870 --> 03:34:06,350
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm dead!

4924
03:34:07,010 --> 03:34:07,750
Okay, now what?

4925
03:34:08,510 --> 03:34:09,730
I climb up.

4926
03:34:09,730 --> 03:34:11,730
That's all we had to do.

4927
03:34:11,730 --> 03:34:12,110
Now what?

4928
03:34:12,290 --> 03:34:13,690
That we climb up.

4929
03:34:16,170 --> 03:34:18,050
You could have just pulled...

4930
03:34:18,050 --> 03:34:19,650
Oh my god, go, go, go, go, go.

4931
03:34:19,750 --> 03:34:20,770
The forest is on fire.

4932
03:34:20,890 --> 03:34:23,890
Just go, just go, just go, just go!

4933
03:34:24,130 --> 03:34:25,030
Go, go!

4934
03:34:25,170 --> 03:34:25,470
Stop!

4935
03:34:25,610 --> 03:34:26,770
Stop looking at the seed!

4936
03:34:27,250 --> 03:34:28,190
We're all dying!

4937
03:34:28,410 --> 03:34:29,130
Oh my god.

4938
03:34:29,390 --> 03:34:29,830
Oh,

4939
03:34:35,060 --> 03:34:35,780
now you go.

4940
03:34:35,920 --> 03:34:36,300
Now that...

4941
03:34:37,320 --> 03:34:38,440
Oh my god.

4942
03:34:38,660 --> 03:34:39,700
Oh, you bitch.

4943
03:34:42,440 --> 03:34:43,740
We're literally dying.

4944
03:34:44,020 --> 03:34:44,960
We're literally...

4945
03:34:44,960 --> 03:34:46,500
Oh my god, hot, hot, hot, hot!

4946
03:34:51,110 --> 03:34:52,270
Oh my god.

4947
03:34:53,530 --> 03:34:53,970
Okay,

4948
03:34:58,670 --> 03:34:59,430
we figured it out.

4949
03:35:00,830 --> 03:35:01,270
What?

4950
03:35:01,550 --> 03:35:02,350
What do you mean, we?

4951
03:35:02,590 --> 03:35:03,530
We figured it out.

4952
03:35:04,050 --> 03:35:05,110
Oh, we figured it out.

4953
03:35:05,330 --> 03:35:06,270
We figured it out.

4954
03:35:11,730 --> 03:35:12,610
You like...

4955
03:35:12,610 --> 03:35:12,850
Dude.

4956
03:35:16,710 --> 03:35:18,750
Oh my god, how do you swing that?

4957
03:35:19,710 --> 03:35:20,450
I think...

4958
03:35:20,450 --> 03:35:21,930
That's only for the secret, isn't it?

4959
03:35:23,110 --> 03:35:23,510
What?

4960
03:35:24,410 --> 03:35:25,410
Did I get it?

4961
03:35:25,550 --> 03:35:26,970
Because we could have gone on the floor, no?

4962
03:35:27,370 --> 03:35:28,430
No, we can't.

4963
03:35:29,150 --> 03:35:30,230
There's a lower branch.

4964
03:35:31,770 --> 03:35:32,590
Yeah, you saw that?

4965
03:35:35,190 --> 03:35:35,590
Whoa,

4966
03:35:39,390 --> 03:35:41,830
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

4967
03:35:42,410 --> 03:35:42,810
Whoa.

4968
03:35:50,550 --> 03:35:52,990
Jesus Christ, the momentum is crazy.

4969
03:35:56,230 --> 03:35:57,850
Stopping the momentum at this point.

4970
03:36:00,790 --> 03:36:03,690
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

4971
03:36:04,450 --> 03:36:05,970
My little tootsie.

4972
03:36:06,410 --> 03:36:08,210
My little tootsie.

4973
03:36:12,700 --> 03:36:14,460
No, no, no, no, no.

4974
03:36:14,660 --> 03:36:15,260
My feet.

4975
03:36:16,160 --> 03:36:16,880
Okay, I'm good.

4976
03:36:18,900 --> 03:36:19,500
Don't die.

4977
03:36:19,620 --> 03:36:20,160
Don't die!

4978
03:36:21,820 --> 03:36:23,500
Get in, get in, get in, get in.

4979
03:36:27,290 --> 03:36:28,090
One person.

4980
03:36:28,190 --> 03:36:29,590
I think this is a one-person job.

4981
03:36:29,850 --> 03:36:31,010
I think that was the issue.

4982
03:36:34,010 --> 03:36:37,350
Things were so much simpler when we were just one person.

4983
03:36:39,590 --> 03:36:39,990
Wow.

4984
03:36:40,610 --> 03:36:42,910
Okay, we gotta do that and then...

4985
03:36:44,110 --> 03:36:44,570
There you go.

4986
03:36:49,930 --> 03:36:51,270
Things are simpler.

4987
03:36:51,570 --> 03:36:52,010
Get on.

4988
03:36:53,310 --> 03:36:54,310
Get on.

4989
03:36:55,710 --> 03:37:02,150
You were not trying hard enough.

4990
03:37:07,270 --> 03:37:09,210
All right, get off.

4991
03:37:09,690 --> 03:37:11,810
Now we both did one puzzle each?

4992
03:37:12,130 --> 03:37:13,370
Life can be so beautiful.

4993
03:37:13,930 --> 03:37:14,130
Oh.

4994
03:37:21,370 --> 03:37:22,010
Are you ready?

4995
03:37:24,990 --> 03:37:25,590
Okay.

4996
03:37:27,790 --> 03:37:29,670
All right, he did...

4997
03:37:29,670 --> 03:37:30,350
All right.

4998
03:37:31,130 --> 03:37:32,570
Just go straight at it.

4999
03:37:32,890 --> 03:37:34,810
Don't even be like, yeah, I'm ready.

5000
03:37:35,270 --> 03:37:36,170
I'm ready.

5001
03:37:43,370 --> 03:37:44,850
Oh my god.

5002
03:37:45,750 --> 03:37:47,470
I felt like a fire pit.

5003
03:37:47,830 --> 03:37:49,530
I think we're supposed to stay on this.

5004
03:37:49,550 --> 03:37:50,390
I think so too.

5005
03:37:51,370 --> 03:37:51,690
Oh!

5006
03:37:53,090 --> 03:37:53,950
Oh, hot!

5007
03:37:54,090 --> 03:37:54,830
Oh, my feet!

5008
03:37:56,250 --> 03:37:57,130
What happened, Gumi?

5009
03:37:57,150 --> 03:37:57,990
I thought you were a gamer.

5010
03:37:58,150 --> 03:37:58,710
What happened?

5011
03:38:03,010 --> 03:38:03,970
Gumi, you okay?

5012
03:38:04,290 --> 03:38:05,830
Maybe this time you'd get it.

5013
03:38:05,930 --> 03:38:06,370
Yeah, see?

5014
03:38:06,430 --> 03:38:07,570
Look, you got it.

5015
03:38:07,970 --> 03:38:12,930
All right, come on.

5016
03:38:13,050 --> 03:38:13,950
Come on, come on.

5017
03:38:14,070 --> 03:38:14,430
Here, boy.

5018
03:38:15,250 --> 03:38:15,590
Come on.

5019
03:38:17,450 --> 03:38:19,750
Use your own feet, you bitch.

5020
03:38:19,750 --> 03:38:21,210
What the...

5021
03:38:25,810 --> 03:38:26,830
Don't go, don't go.

5022
03:38:26,930 --> 03:38:27,970
Don't go all the way there.

5023
03:38:28,070 --> 03:38:28,810
Come on, I'm pulling you.

5024
03:38:28,910 --> 03:38:29,850
Come on, come on.

5025
03:38:30,490 --> 03:38:31,030
Pulling you.

5026
03:38:31,290 --> 03:38:32,230
Hot, hot, hot!

5027
03:38:34,490 --> 03:38:35,030
All right.

5028
03:38:35,430 --> 03:38:39,610
I think you controlled my volume too, so the game got so loud.

5029
03:38:40,110 --> 03:38:40,870
No, I didn't.

5030
03:38:40,890 --> 03:38:41,750
I didn't do anything.

5031
03:38:42,350 --> 03:38:44,950
No, no, I meant earlier, and I just never adjusted it back.

5032
03:38:47,190 --> 03:38:48,710
Yeah, I was gonna say, like, what do you mean?

5033
03:38:48,750 --> 03:38:49,830
I didn't adjust anything.

5034
03:38:50,530 --> 03:38:50,790
No!

5035
03:38:54,330 --> 03:38:54,810
No!

5036
03:38:54,810 --> 03:38:55,410
Oh, we have to stay.

5037
03:38:55,490 --> 03:38:56,690
We do not stay on it?

5038
03:38:56,810 --> 03:38:57,030
No.

5039
03:38:58,190 --> 03:38:58,870
Wait, what?

5040
03:38:59,270 --> 03:38:59,810
How do we...

5041
03:39:00,550 --> 03:39:01,030
Oh!

5042
03:39:02,270 --> 03:39:03,690
It happened so fast.

5043
03:39:05,730 --> 03:39:07,170
No, I could just stay on it.

5044
03:39:07,230 --> 03:39:07,730
What do you mean?

5045
03:39:08,530 --> 03:39:10,050
Why would I jump back on it?

5046
03:39:11,010 --> 03:39:12,350
I literally stood on it.

5047
03:39:15,190 --> 03:39:16,110
You okay there?

5048
03:39:18,890 --> 03:39:20,290
You okay over there?

5049
03:39:26,150 --> 03:39:26,510
Yeah.

5050
03:39:27,370 --> 03:39:28,850
I was just showing you what you did.

5051
03:39:30,990 --> 03:39:31,350
Yeah.

5052
03:39:32,470 --> 03:39:34,810
Yeah, I was like, oh, she's so stupid.

5053
03:39:35,390 --> 03:39:35,830
You get one.

5054
03:39:35,990 --> 03:39:36,430
You get one.

5055
03:39:36,590 --> 03:39:37,110
You get one.

5056
03:39:37,990 --> 03:39:38,570
You get one.

5057
03:39:39,310 --> 03:39:40,710
How would you think you're gonna get it?

5058
03:39:41,830 --> 03:39:42,570
You get one.

5059
03:39:44,630 --> 03:39:45,790
Wait, it's not even a shiny.

5060
03:39:45,930 --> 03:39:46,930
It's a puzzle we need to do.

5061
03:39:53,170 --> 03:39:54,310
How do we do this puzzle?

5062
03:39:55,530 --> 03:39:55,850
Oh.

5063
03:39:59,530 --> 03:40:00,570
You pushing it?

5064
03:40:01,090 --> 03:40:04,170
Row, row, row, row, row, row.

5065
03:40:04,250 --> 03:40:05,330
Okay, your turn.

5066
03:40:09,300 --> 03:40:09,740
Think.

5067
03:40:12,280 --> 03:40:12,720
Think.

5068
03:40:13,820 --> 03:40:15,960
Wait, what's that flower thing over there?

5069
03:40:16,540 --> 03:40:16,980
Oh!

5070
03:40:17,820 --> 03:40:19,220
Maybe you can use that as a momentum?

5071
03:40:20,600 --> 03:40:21,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5072
03:40:21,500 --> 03:40:21,900
No, no, no, no!

5073
03:40:21,900 --> 03:40:22,400
I got an idea!

5074
03:40:22,460 --> 03:40:22,860
I got an idea!

5075
03:40:23,040 --> 03:40:23,180
Oh.

5076
03:40:24,000 --> 03:40:24,340
Wait.

5077
03:40:27,120 --> 03:40:28,580
Can you pull this up?

5078
03:40:28,780 --> 03:40:29,600
Oh, never mind.

5079
03:40:31,620 --> 03:40:33,100
I was gonna say...

5080
03:40:33,100 --> 03:40:35,220
Is there a way to...

5081
03:40:35,220 --> 03:40:37,880
Pull this up higher so you can use as a momentum?

5082
03:40:38,540 --> 03:40:40,400
So we have to use as momentum, right?

5083
03:40:42,100 --> 03:40:43,140
Oh, there you go.

5084
03:40:44,680 --> 03:40:45,400
You're welcome.

5085
03:40:49,810 --> 03:40:50,670
And then what?

5086
03:40:57,910 --> 03:40:59,010
What do you do with that?

5087
03:40:59,150 --> 03:40:59,270
No, dang it.

5088
03:41:03,730 --> 03:41:04,150
Oh!

5089
03:41:04,590 --> 03:41:05,310
I know.

5090
03:41:07,170 --> 03:41:07,870
I know.

5091
03:41:09,310 --> 03:41:10,430
Wait, why did you let go?

5092
03:41:12,370 --> 03:41:13,470
Why did you do that?

5093
03:41:16,730 --> 03:41:18,150
I untied the wrong string.

5094
03:41:18,490 --> 03:41:19,790
Oh my god, there's kids in the background!

5095
03:41:21,050 --> 03:41:21,670
Oh, they're...

5096
03:41:21,670 --> 03:41:22,250
What are they doing?

5097
03:41:22,290 --> 03:41:23,430
Oh, they're trying to lift the wood!

5098
03:41:25,890 --> 03:41:26,710
Do you need help?

5099
03:41:26,730 --> 03:41:27,350
I went too early.

5100
03:41:28,150 --> 03:41:29,150
Do you need help there?

5101
03:41:29,790 --> 03:41:30,150
No.

5102
03:41:30,750 --> 03:41:31,030
You sure?

5103
03:41:31,030 --> 03:41:31,210
Okay.

5104
03:41:36,170 --> 03:41:37,710
Oh, you're doing it?

5105
03:41:43,000 --> 03:41:46,020
Oh, if you tie it, if you tie it, I can like pull it.

5106
03:41:50,180 --> 03:41:50,920
Yeah, see?

5107
03:41:54,320 --> 03:41:55,540
Wait, where am I?

5108
03:41:56,260 --> 03:41:57,140
Where did I go?

5109
03:41:57,900 --> 03:41:58,960
Oh wait, here I am.

5110
03:41:59,180 --> 03:41:59,900
What the fuck?

5111
03:41:59,900 --> 03:42:00,740
How did I get here?

5112
03:42:03,000 --> 03:42:06,020
Wait a minute, how did I get over here?

5113
03:42:06,500 --> 03:42:07,840
Wait, wait, what?

5114
03:42:08,840 --> 03:42:09,560
How do I...

5115
03:42:11,300 --> 03:42:12,380
How did I get here?

5116
03:42:12,520 --> 03:42:13,480
What the fuck?

5117
03:42:13,640 --> 03:42:14,960
I was like wondering where I went.

5118
03:42:15,460 --> 03:42:16,300
Okay, here we go.

5119
03:42:24,030 --> 03:42:25,610
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

5120
03:42:25,790 --> 03:42:26,030
Okay.

5121
03:42:35,990 --> 03:42:37,170
I don't know.

5122
03:42:41,040 --> 03:42:42,040
Wait, can't I...

5123
03:42:47,490 --> 03:42:49,970
Can't I just swing on the other side if you keep it taut?

5124
03:42:50,850 --> 03:42:52,190
Wait, wait, wait, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5125
03:42:52,190 --> 03:42:52,690
Oh yeah, there you go.

5126
03:42:53,670 --> 03:42:54,230
And then pull.

5127
03:42:57,190 --> 03:42:57,710
And then pull?

5128
03:42:58,270 --> 03:42:59,150
Yeah, pull.

5129
03:43:02,150 --> 03:43:02,870
I'm not letting you...

5130
03:43:03,910 --> 03:43:04,730
I'm pulling?

5131
03:43:07,450 --> 03:43:10,410
I think because you're at the bottom, I think.

5132
03:43:10,830 --> 03:43:12,070
Oh no, you...

5133
03:43:12,070 --> 03:43:12,810
Oh my god.

5134
03:43:12,810 --> 03:43:15,210
Oh no, I'm back here.

5135
03:43:21,650 --> 03:43:23,130
Is it because my string's attached to it?

5136
03:43:23,170 --> 03:43:23,810
No, it can't be.

5137
03:43:23,810 --> 03:43:24,670
No, no, no.

5138
03:43:24,890 --> 03:43:26,250
You gotta go to the other side again.

5139
03:43:27,230 --> 03:43:29,950
It's because you were too heavy on the other side, so you have to go back downstairs.

5140
03:43:29,970 --> 03:43:31,570
What is this string for down here?

5141
03:43:31,790 --> 03:43:32,450
I don't know.

5142
03:43:35,470 --> 03:43:36,870
Because it keeps it like that.

5143
03:43:40,050 --> 03:43:40,550
I don't think...

5144
03:43:40,550 --> 03:43:42,110
Oh, will you tie it down?

5145
03:43:42,270 --> 03:43:43,970
Oh, maybe I tie it down?

5146
03:43:45,790 --> 03:43:47,270
Oh, oh, I know, I know, I know.

5147
03:43:47,290 --> 03:43:49,850
I go on the other side and then tie it down after.

5148
03:43:51,230 --> 03:43:52,090
Yeah, you untie it.

5149
03:43:52,150 --> 03:43:53,150
I figured it out, I figured it out.

5150
03:43:53,850 --> 03:43:55,270
Okay, but not like that.

5151
03:43:57,710 --> 03:43:58,990
Alright, so you do that thing.

5152
03:43:59,090 --> 03:43:59,510
I've done that one too many times.

5153
03:44:00,690 --> 03:44:02,070
Okay, I figured it out, I figured it out.

5154
03:44:02,690 --> 03:44:03,950
I can tie it on my end.

5155
03:44:06,810 --> 03:44:08,270
Then you swing to the other side.

5156
03:44:08,410 --> 03:44:09,090
You loop around.

5157
03:44:11,390 --> 03:44:12,530
You just gotta swing to the other.

5158
03:44:16,160 --> 03:44:17,180
How did you do it?

5159
03:44:17,780 --> 03:44:19,360
How did you swing to the other side?

5160
03:44:23,270 --> 03:44:25,790
You're too heavy, so I can't move it up.

5161
03:44:25,850 --> 03:44:26,450
So you have to...

5162
03:44:26,450 --> 03:44:26,990
Yeah, there you go.

5163
03:44:27,990 --> 03:44:29,190
Yeah, yeah, you have to...

5164
03:44:29,190 --> 03:44:32,190
You have to be up top more and then...

5165
03:44:32,910 --> 03:44:34,430
Because I can't push it up.

5166
03:44:35,410 --> 03:44:38,170
I think I need you to stop moving because you're changing the length of my rope.

5167
03:44:38,370 --> 03:44:38,690
Oh.

5168
03:44:48,330 --> 03:44:49,850
How did you do it last time?

5169
03:44:50,930 --> 03:44:51,750
I don't know.

5170
03:44:52,610 --> 03:44:53,610
Oh wait, maybe...

5171
03:44:53,610 --> 03:44:54,590
Oh, just pull up here.

5172
03:44:54,710 --> 03:44:55,190
Can't you just...

5173
03:44:55,790 --> 03:44:56,990
Yeah, that's how you did it.

5174
03:44:57,950 --> 03:45:00,370
And then all I have to do is just...

5175
03:45:00,390 --> 03:45:01,370
Tie it here.

5176
03:45:02,790 --> 03:45:03,270
Oh.

5177
03:45:04,430 --> 03:45:05,430
You untied it.

5178
03:45:05,570 --> 03:45:06,830
I pressed the wrong button.

5179
03:45:09,330 --> 03:45:11,650
I pressed the wrong button.

5180
03:45:12,410 --> 03:45:15,990
Okay, you gotta do that again, but we figured it out.

5181
03:45:16,890 --> 03:45:18,970
Wait, I need to get back to the top.

5182
03:45:19,050 --> 03:45:19,950
I need to get back up here.

5183
03:45:20,790 --> 03:45:21,950
Okay, there you go.

5184
03:45:24,190 --> 03:45:27,870
I forgot B is untie on my controller.

5185
03:45:28,150 --> 03:45:29,730
A is untie for me.

5186
03:45:29,730 --> 03:45:29,950
No, B.

5187
03:45:29,950 --> 03:45:31,330
B is untie for me.

5188
03:45:31,530 --> 03:45:33,410
No, I'm saying A is untie for me.

5189
03:45:38,890 --> 03:45:39,940
And then you just...

5190
03:45:41,370 --> 03:45:43,790
Oh, you have to do that and then you just...

5191
03:45:43,790 --> 03:45:44,010
Yeah.

5192
03:45:44,950 --> 03:45:50,400
And then I just go over here and then...

5193
03:45:53,290 --> 03:45:54,590
Can you go up a little bit?

5194
03:45:58,170 --> 03:45:59,190
Oh yeah, I did it.

5195
03:46:02,190 --> 03:46:03,190
And then...

5196
03:46:03,190 --> 03:46:04,030
Do you untie that?

5197
03:46:06,290 --> 03:46:07,150
Untie it?

5198
03:46:07,270 --> 03:46:08,950
Untie the other... the top part, right?

5199
03:46:09,730 --> 03:46:11,370
Why would I untie the top part?

5200
03:46:15,700 --> 03:46:16,240
I don't know.

5201
03:46:16,240 --> 03:46:17,240
Because we're trying to pull it down.

5202
03:46:17,880 --> 03:46:19,460
Yeah, so we untie that.

5203
03:46:19,700 --> 03:46:20,280
We're gonna be...

5204
03:46:21,040 --> 03:46:22,340
Okay, wait, wait.

5205
03:46:22,580 --> 03:46:23,280
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

5206
03:46:29,280 --> 03:46:30,840
I'm gonna untie it.

5207
03:46:31,960 --> 03:46:32,440
Okay.

5208
03:46:33,620 --> 03:46:34,540
Because I fucked up.

5209
03:46:40,610 --> 03:46:42,020
I hooked up.

5210
03:46:43,240 --> 03:46:44,500
Yeah, do it again.

5211
03:46:48,440 --> 03:46:52,540
Oh, do I untie my thing first?

5212
03:46:53,820 --> 03:46:54,380
Maybe?

5213
03:46:55,580 --> 03:46:57,040
You better untie this first.

5214
03:46:59,560 --> 03:46:59,860
Yeah.

5215
03:47:05,180 --> 03:47:06,120
Wait, I...

5216
03:47:06,120 --> 03:47:06,720
No, no, no.

5217
03:47:08,480 --> 03:47:09,560
Can you go under?

5218
03:47:10,060 --> 03:47:10,920
I can't.

5219
03:47:11,020 --> 03:47:11,680
Jump down?

5220
03:47:12,120 --> 03:47:12,820
Like...

5221
03:47:12,820 --> 03:47:13,720
Press down and jump?

5222
03:47:13,960 --> 03:47:14,820
I can't because this...

5223
03:47:14,820 --> 03:47:16,040
Yeah, this thing is blocking me.

5224
03:47:16,620 --> 03:47:19,700
So I need you to let go so I can jump down.

5225
03:47:21,120 --> 03:47:21,460
Ew.

5226
03:47:27,210 --> 03:47:28,470
My brain hurts.

5227
03:47:29,050 --> 03:47:32,250
We're gonna be stuck in this burning forest and then die from the lack of air.

5228
03:47:43,760 --> 03:47:44,900
Look, I have a wedgie.

5229
03:47:47,220 --> 03:47:48,700
No, you're Spongebob.

5230
03:47:48,700 --> 03:47:51,040
You're literally Spongebob right now.

5231
03:47:54,620 --> 03:47:55,500
Get down!

5232
03:47:55,980 --> 03:47:56,800
I can't!

5233
03:47:56,880 --> 03:47:57,920
I'm out of string!

5234
03:47:58,140 --> 03:47:58,960
I can't do anything!

5235
03:47:59,260 --> 03:48:00,200
Okay, wait, I got an idea.

5236
03:48:05,140 --> 03:48:05,580
There.

5237
03:48:06,700 --> 03:48:07,800
You should have your string now.

5238
03:48:13,010 --> 03:48:13,990
Do you not have string?

5239
03:48:15,470 --> 03:48:17,410
No, this is as much string as I have.

5240
03:48:17,690 --> 03:48:18,570
How do I get back up?

5241
03:48:20,630 --> 03:48:21,530
All right, here we go.

5242
03:48:22,430 --> 03:48:22,870
Go.

5243
03:48:23,910 --> 03:48:24,390
Okay.

5244
03:48:26,970 --> 03:48:28,510
I gave you string.

5245
03:48:31,570 --> 03:48:32,690
Yeah, I had to.

5246
03:48:33,070 --> 03:48:33,950
To give you string.

5247
03:48:37,230 --> 03:48:37,710
Ew.

5248
03:48:40,370 --> 03:48:41,230
I get...

5249
03:48:41,230 --> 03:48:41,230
oh.

5250
03:48:42,690 --> 03:48:43,330
Yeah, it's tied.

5251
03:48:48,170 --> 03:48:48,890
Okay, wait.

5252
03:48:49,330 --> 03:48:50,090
Yeah, you push out.

5253
03:48:50,350 --> 03:48:51,150
Push it, push it.

5254
03:48:51,690 --> 03:48:52,850
Just push out above me.

5255
03:48:54,050 --> 03:48:54,570
Okay.

5256
03:48:57,690 --> 03:49:02,470
I'm literally pushing it the only way that I can and it's flopping back down.

5257
03:49:04,590 --> 03:49:05,830
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

5258
03:49:09,300 --> 03:49:11,100
All right, I tied it.

5259
03:49:13,100 --> 03:49:13,620
Hello.

5260
03:49:14,140 --> 03:49:14,700
Let go.

5261
03:49:15,500 --> 03:49:16,180
Let go!

5262
03:49:26,230 --> 03:49:27,810
I don't think this is it.

5263
03:49:28,110 --> 03:49:29,050
I don't think so either.

5264
03:49:29,050 --> 03:49:31,290
Why did we do it again?

5265
03:49:31,310 --> 03:49:32,010
I don't know.

5266
03:49:32,450 --> 03:49:33,370
I don't know.

5267
03:49:33,910 --> 03:49:35,630
I'm following your lead, but like...

5268
03:49:35,630 --> 03:49:37,030
Why are you following my lead?

5269
03:49:37,130 --> 03:49:38,390
I'm not the only one here.

5270
03:49:38,550 --> 03:49:40,070
I don't know how to solve puzzles.

5271
03:49:40,690 --> 03:49:41,470
Why are you following...

5272
03:49:41,470 --> 03:49:42,190
Do the thing!

5273
03:49:42,250 --> 03:49:42,990
Do the thing!

5274
03:49:43,690 --> 03:49:44,490
Do the thing!

5275
03:49:48,770 --> 03:49:49,850
Now what do we do?

5276
03:49:56,130 --> 03:49:57,210
I tied it.

5277
03:50:00,390 --> 03:50:01,750
Now what do we do?

5278
03:50:05,810 --> 03:50:06,530
Oh, wait.

5279
03:50:06,630 --> 03:50:07,610
I got an idea.

5280
03:50:08,330 --> 03:50:09,970
Okay, you do your thing.

5281
03:50:11,290 --> 03:50:12,090
What thing?

5282
03:50:12,550 --> 03:50:13,330
Wait, I got an idea.

5283
03:50:13,510 --> 03:50:14,370
I figured it out.

5284
03:50:14,410 --> 03:50:15,130
I figured it out.

5285
03:50:15,170 --> 03:50:15,810
I figured it out.

5286
03:50:15,890 --> 03:50:16,530
You do your thing.

5287
03:50:16,750 --> 03:50:17,730
You do your thing.

5288
03:50:17,870 --> 03:50:19,190
You do that thing where you...

5289
03:50:19,190 --> 03:50:20,490
I have to make it go down!

5290
03:50:20,890 --> 03:50:22,110
No, no, you do your thing.

5291
03:50:22,210 --> 03:50:22,730
You do your...

5292
03:50:22,730 --> 03:50:23,630
I figured it out.

5293
03:50:23,710 --> 03:50:24,850
I think my brain...

5294
03:50:24,850 --> 03:50:25,910
My brain is...

5295
03:50:25,910 --> 03:50:26,170
Whoa.

5296
03:50:26,870 --> 03:50:28,150
Whoa, it's expanding.

5297
03:50:28,410 --> 03:50:28,970
It's expanding.

5298
03:50:29,110 --> 03:50:29,690
I figured it out.

5299
03:50:29,750 --> 03:50:30,550
I know, I know.

5300
03:50:31,050 --> 03:50:31,770
I know now.

5301
03:50:31,970 --> 03:50:34,110
I need one more rope and I can't move from this area.

5302
03:50:34,670 --> 03:50:35,470
I know now.

5303
03:50:36,610 --> 03:50:37,190
Do your thing.

5304
03:50:39,230 --> 03:50:40,190
Do your thing.

5305
03:50:40,770 --> 03:50:41,790
I figured it out.

5306
03:50:41,890 --> 03:50:42,290
Do your thing!

5307
03:50:42,750 --> 03:50:43,670
I have no more rope.

5308
03:50:43,790 --> 03:50:44,610
I have no more rope.

5309
03:50:44,610 --> 03:50:46,670
I don't know what to do for you.

5310
03:50:46,990 --> 03:50:48,070
It's because you tied it.

5311
03:50:48,410 --> 03:50:49,150
Don't tie it.

5312
03:50:49,210 --> 03:50:50,050
Don't tie it.

5313
03:50:52,550 --> 03:50:53,410
Let go.

5314
03:50:55,630 --> 03:50:57,070
Why did you tie that one?

5315
03:50:57,950 --> 03:50:59,090
I figured it out.

5316
03:50:59,630 --> 03:51:00,770
I figured it out.

5317
03:51:00,810 --> 03:51:01,570
I figured it out.

5318
03:51:01,670 --> 03:51:02,850
I figured it out.

5319
03:51:02,910 --> 03:51:03,790
I know, I know.

5320
03:51:04,690 --> 03:51:05,810
I figured it out.

5321
03:51:06,010 --> 03:51:06,570
Do your thing!

5322
03:51:06,890 --> 03:51:07,270
Do your thing!

5323
03:51:07,350 --> 03:51:07,850
Do your thing!

5324
03:51:07,930 --> 03:51:08,430
Do your thing!

5325
03:51:08,730 --> 03:51:09,430
Watch this!

5326
03:51:09,510 --> 03:51:09,930
Do your thing!

5327
03:51:10,030 --> 03:51:10,390
Do your thing!

5328
03:51:10,510 --> 03:51:11,270
Get on there!

5329
03:51:11,390 --> 03:51:11,970
Get on there!

5330
03:51:14,070 --> 03:51:14,770
This is...

5331
03:51:14,770 --> 03:51:15,850
It won't let me go lower.

5332
03:51:16,410 --> 03:51:19,110
No, how did you do the thing where you get to the other side?

5333
03:51:20,970 --> 03:51:21,770
I'm not...

5334
03:51:21,770 --> 03:51:23,790
I just need you to know that...

5335
03:51:23,790 --> 03:51:24,110
Okay.

5336
03:51:26,490 --> 03:51:27,270
Do your thing!

5337
03:51:27,350 --> 03:51:28,350
I figured it out!

5338
03:51:30,050 --> 03:51:32,030
It's gonna be so cool when you see it.

5339
03:51:35,530 --> 03:51:37,450
Why won't it let me go lower anymore?

5340
03:51:37,750 --> 03:51:38,670
I don't fucking know.

5341
03:51:38,910 --> 03:51:40,770
I'm not pulling anything either.

5342
03:51:44,150 --> 03:51:45,310
I'm letting you have...

5343
03:51:46,130 --> 03:51:47,690
I'm letting you have all the strength.

5344
03:51:47,790 --> 03:51:48,930
Do you remember how to do it?

5345
03:51:49,770 --> 03:51:52,290
I'm pressing down on the climb button!

5346
03:51:53,650 --> 03:51:54,930
Maybe you're like...

5347
03:51:54,930 --> 03:51:55,570
I don't know.

5348
03:51:55,670 --> 03:51:57,090
I'm literally just watching you.

5349
03:52:05,270 --> 03:52:06,790
I think our string is broken.

5350
03:52:07,210 --> 03:52:07,410
No!

5351
03:52:08,110 --> 03:52:08,890
I figured it!

5352
03:52:11,350 --> 03:52:13,410
I figured out I need you to do your thing!

5353
03:52:13,510 --> 03:52:14,530
That's all I need!

5354
03:52:16,690 --> 03:52:18,950
I literally figured it out!

5355
03:52:19,810 --> 03:52:22,250
I just need you to do your thing!

5356
03:52:24,990 --> 03:52:26,830
What happened to your string?

5357
03:52:28,230 --> 03:52:30,390
I don't know what to tell you.

5358
03:52:30,670 --> 03:52:32,470
I don't know what to tell you.

5359
03:52:32,910 --> 03:52:33,450
It's...

5360
03:52:33,450 --> 03:52:34,190
Oh my god!

5361
03:52:34,230 --> 03:52:35,470
It's so cool!

5362
03:52:35,470 --> 03:52:37,470
The idea I had!

5363
03:52:37,910 --> 03:52:39,350
It's so cool!

5364
03:52:39,770 --> 03:52:40,410
I swear!

5365
03:52:41,670 --> 03:52:43,490
It's basically it!

5366
03:52:43,590 --> 03:52:44,330
It's it!

5367
03:52:44,390 --> 03:52:45,490
It's the idea!

5368
03:52:46,250 --> 03:52:47,310
Okay, all right.

5369
03:52:47,370 --> 03:52:48,150
We swap places.

5370
03:52:48,590 --> 03:52:49,610
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

5371
03:52:50,210 --> 03:52:51,310
Okay, okay.

5372
03:52:51,310 --> 03:52:51,950
Watch this.

5373
03:53:00,250 --> 03:53:02,050
I need you to...

5374
03:53:03,690 --> 03:53:04,090
Okay.

5375
03:53:04,590 --> 03:53:05,410
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

5376
03:53:05,450 --> 03:53:06,190
Watch this.

5377
03:53:07,050 --> 03:53:08,190
I figured it out.

5378
03:53:09,250 --> 03:53:10,690
I figured it out.

5379
03:53:10,690 --> 03:53:11,450
Yes.

5380
03:53:11,950 --> 03:53:12,610
Yeah.

5381
03:53:15,910 --> 03:53:16,590
Okay.

5382
03:53:17,650 --> 03:53:20,070
I don't have enough string to get it.

5383
03:53:20,530 --> 03:53:21,650
No, I was...

5384
03:53:22,430 --> 03:53:23,890
I was gonna let go.

5385
03:53:24,030 --> 03:53:24,710
I was gonna...

5386
03:53:24,710 --> 03:53:25,950
I was gonna let go.

5387
03:53:30,570 --> 03:53:32,190
We almost had it.

5388
03:53:32,430 --> 03:53:35,350
We almost had it.

5389
03:53:37,010 --> 03:53:38,710
You stay right there.

5390
03:53:42,790 --> 03:53:44,210
Okay, I'm gonna let go.

5391
03:53:47,710 --> 03:53:50,910
I don't know how you're gonna get there, but like, I'm gonna let go.

5392
03:53:52,770 --> 03:53:53,870
I don't know.

5393
03:53:54,130 --> 03:53:57,170
I don't know how you're gonna get to the other side.

5394
03:53:57,730 --> 03:53:58,830
But I'm gonna watch.

5395
03:53:58,990 --> 03:54:00,230
I'm gonna watch.

5396
03:54:04,570 --> 03:54:05,250
Oh my god.

5397
03:54:05,490 --> 03:54:06,870
This has to be the longest.

5398
03:54:06,870 --> 03:54:07,110
Yes.

5399
03:54:18,110 --> 03:54:23,870
Did I just do this other time?

5400
03:54:27,090 --> 03:54:28,250
Here, all right.

5401
03:54:29,270 --> 03:54:31,390
I have the word here if you want to use it.

5402
03:54:31,870 --> 03:54:35,390
Here it is.

5403
03:54:40,790 --> 03:54:41,270
Okay.

5404
03:54:41,270 --> 03:54:42,630
Guys, we're gonna be here for a little bit.

5405
03:54:48,970 --> 03:54:51,390
I don't understand why it's taking you...

5406
03:54:51,390 --> 03:54:52,950
Making it so difficult for you.

5407
03:54:54,190 --> 03:54:55,370
Okay, why don't we swap?

5408
03:54:56,150 --> 03:54:57,790
All right, all right, all right.

5409
03:54:57,810 --> 03:54:58,750
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

5410
03:55:03,670 --> 03:55:05,630
I'm trying to get back up.

5411
03:55:06,530 --> 03:55:08,590
All right, all right, let's go.

5412
03:55:08,830 --> 03:55:10,110
All right, I'm pulling you up.

5413
03:55:10,230 --> 03:55:11,270
I'm pulling you up.

5414
03:55:11,450 --> 03:55:12,210
All right, let's swap.

5415
03:55:12,390 --> 03:55:13,130
All right, let's go.

5416
03:55:16,630 --> 03:55:20,190
How is this puzzle the hardest puzzle we've ever done?

5417
03:55:22,710 --> 03:55:25,010
How could this one be the hardest?

5418
03:55:29,530 --> 03:55:32,210
So how did you get all the way down though?

5419
03:55:39,430 --> 03:55:40,110
There you go.

5420
03:55:40,230 --> 03:55:41,130
Oh wait, I did that.

5421
03:55:41,310 --> 03:55:42,670
Oh wait, I actually did that.

5422
03:55:42,790 --> 03:55:43,410
Oh my god.

5423
03:55:45,270 --> 03:55:46,110
This is it.

5424
03:55:46,930 --> 03:55:47,790
This is it.

5425
03:55:48,070 --> 03:55:49,290
We figured it out, guys.

5426
03:55:49,530 --> 03:55:50,170
This is it.

5427
03:55:53,130 --> 03:55:53,910
This is it.

5428
03:55:53,990 --> 03:55:54,990
We figured it out.

5429
03:55:55,650 --> 03:55:59,050
I really want like Taiwanese beef noodle soup.

5430
03:55:59,130 --> 03:55:59,590
There you go.

5431
03:55:59,970 --> 03:56:00,550
I did it.

5432
03:56:01,170 --> 03:56:02,050
Okay, now what?

5433
03:56:02,050 --> 03:56:08,130
Now shouldn't you come over and tie it and like push me up?

5434
03:56:09,050 --> 03:56:10,230
No, no, no, at the bottom.

5435
03:56:10,310 --> 03:56:11,490
At the bottom of the tree stump.

5436
03:56:16,970 --> 03:56:18,530
We figured it out, guys.

5437
03:56:18,950 --> 03:56:19,530
This is it.

5438
03:56:21,650 --> 03:56:22,910
This is it right here.

5439
03:56:26,300 --> 03:56:27,800
All right, now I'm gonna let go.

5440
03:56:32,440 --> 03:56:33,740
I'm gonna um...

5441
03:56:35,400 --> 03:56:38,260
Yeah, maybe tie at the bottom first, right?

5442
03:56:41,220 --> 03:56:41,680
Yeah.

5443
03:56:41,680 --> 03:56:42,300
Well, okay.

5444
03:56:45,590 --> 03:56:46,650
But do you have enough?

5445
03:56:46,730 --> 03:56:49,110
You gotta pull the string up so you can tie the bottom.

5446
03:56:50,370 --> 03:56:54,170
And then you like, maybe like after you push it up, you tie it.

5447
03:56:57,370 --> 03:56:59,850
I think we're making this much more complicated than it should be.

5448
03:57:00,130 --> 03:57:00,910
Not gonna lie.

5449
03:57:01,730 --> 03:57:02,750
Yeah, no, I agree.

5450
03:57:03,830 --> 03:57:06,150
You can't just tie the string there.

5451
03:57:17,410 --> 03:57:21,810
We're definitely making this much more...

5452
03:57:34,660 --> 03:57:37,000
Yeah, I went up.

5453
03:57:42,200 --> 03:57:45,120
How is this the hardest puzzle yet?

5454
03:57:45,400 --> 03:57:47,020
I don't understand.

5455
03:57:49,600 --> 03:57:51,900
I don't understand, I'm just confused.

5456
03:57:52,540 --> 03:57:54,520
The hardest puzzle we've done.

5457
03:58:00,780 --> 03:58:02,220
What do I do?

5458
03:58:03,400 --> 03:58:04,180
Maybe here?

5459
03:58:05,240 --> 03:58:05,980
What?

5460
03:58:08,100 --> 03:58:08,800
What?

5461
03:58:08,980 --> 03:58:10,400
You're just scaring me, that's all.

5462
03:58:11,800 --> 03:58:13,240
Maybe you tie there?

5463
03:58:14,520 --> 03:58:15,700
Okay, and then what?

5464
03:58:16,920 --> 03:58:18,160
I don't fucking know.

5465
03:58:21,180 --> 03:58:22,160
And then maybe...

5466
03:58:23,940 --> 03:58:25,740
Maybe, oh, bring the wood?

5467
03:58:26,120 --> 03:58:26,520
Yeah.

5468
03:58:36,810 --> 03:58:37,290
Ready?

5469
03:58:42,690 --> 03:58:44,090
The wood left without me.

5470
03:58:45,190 --> 03:58:45,990
I mean, technically.

5471
03:58:53,090 --> 03:58:54,790
You didn't tie it, by the way, you didn't.

5472
03:58:56,030 --> 03:58:57,670
Well, I can't jump up and...

5473
03:58:58,070 --> 03:58:59,170
Oh, all right.

5474
03:59:09,190 --> 03:59:10,810
Now I'm Spongebob.

5475
03:59:22,490 --> 03:59:23,650
Press F for hint?

5476
03:59:24,010 --> 03:59:26,490
No, no, no hints!

5477
03:59:27,550 --> 03:59:30,390
I think I figured it out, I think I figured it out.

5478
03:59:31,710 --> 03:59:32,790
I think I know.

5479
03:59:34,330 --> 03:59:35,210
I think I know.

5480
03:59:39,590 --> 03:59:40,690
I think I know.

5481
03:59:42,750 --> 03:59:43,730
I think I know.

5482
03:59:45,910 --> 03:59:47,050
I think I know.

5483
03:59:47,370 --> 03:59:49,330
Just gotta get to the other side.

5484
03:59:49,950 --> 03:59:51,170
How did you get to the other side?

5485
03:59:51,210 --> 03:59:51,710
I forgot.

5486
03:59:53,390 --> 03:59:54,850
You swung over the top.

5487
03:59:55,950 --> 03:59:56,490
Okay, here.

5488
03:59:57,970 --> 03:59:58,490
Weeeew!

5489
03:59:59,970 --> 04:00:00,490
Weeeew!

5490
04:00:01,670 --> 04:00:02,190
Weeeew!

5491
04:00:02,790 --> 04:00:03,650
Oh my god!

5492
04:00:05,270 --> 04:00:05,790
Weeeew!

5493
04:00:08,870 --> 04:00:09,390
Weeeew!

5494
04:00:09,390 --> 04:00:11,810
I definitely figured it out this time, I swear.

5495
04:00:14,590 --> 04:00:18,750
Okay, no, no, I almost got to the other side.

5496
04:00:19,910 --> 04:00:27,630
There you go, and then you fling me, you fling me across, you fling me across, yes.

5497
04:00:29,670 --> 04:00:31,450
You fling me across.

5498
04:00:33,390 --> 04:00:37,010
I'm gonna let go, and then you're gonna give me momentum right here.

5499
04:00:37,930 --> 04:00:38,370
Okay.

5500
04:00:41,150 --> 04:00:41,710
Okay.

5501
04:00:41,710 --> 04:00:43,510
Okay, well that's all momentum you're getting.

5502
04:00:49,610 --> 04:00:51,050
Okay, Spongebob.

5503
04:00:55,670 --> 04:00:57,490
I give up.

5504
04:00:59,530 --> 04:01:02,170
No, I don't wanna be here again.

5505
04:01:02,690 --> 04:01:03,730
I give up.

5506
04:01:09,350 --> 04:01:11,490
I don't know anymore.

5507
04:01:13,990 --> 04:01:15,990
I thought I figured it out.

5508
04:01:16,050 --> 04:01:19,030
I thought you were supposed to be the smart one out of us.

5509
04:01:19,990 --> 04:01:21,110
I'm tired!

5510
04:01:21,970 --> 04:01:24,670
We have one chapter left!

5511
04:01:29,300 --> 04:01:30,100
All right.

5512
04:01:34,250 --> 04:01:35,390
Oh, I get it.

5513
04:01:35,450 --> 04:01:36,190
I get it now.

5514
04:01:37,130 --> 04:01:38,430
You said that earlier.

5515
04:01:39,210 --> 04:01:40,550
Yeah, but I get it for real.

5516
04:01:41,570 --> 04:01:42,130
Okay.

5517
04:01:43,510 --> 04:01:45,350
I get it for real now.

5518
04:01:47,990 --> 04:01:48,710
Okay.

5519
04:02:02,050 --> 04:02:07,170
Oh no, no, no, no, you were so close!

5520
04:02:09,790 --> 04:02:11,090
It's my turn.

5521
04:02:12,830 --> 04:02:14,270
Okay, now fling me.

5522
04:02:15,810 --> 04:02:17,790
The flinging's not gonna work!

5523
04:02:18,670 --> 04:02:20,890
No, it's gonna work, I swear.

5524
04:02:21,310 --> 04:02:21,990
I swear!

5525
04:02:27,990 --> 04:02:29,570
Now fling me.

5526
04:02:31,870 --> 04:02:32,630
Fling me.

5527
04:02:33,950 --> 04:02:36,130
There's a loop from the left stump?

5528
04:02:36,450 --> 04:02:37,190
Where's the loop?

5529
04:02:41,940 --> 04:02:44,020
Guys, guys, we're gonna phone a friend.

5530
04:02:44,260 --> 04:02:45,200
Guys, we...

5531
04:02:48,220 --> 04:02:49,220
Wait, wait, wait!

5532
04:02:49,260 --> 04:02:50,160
Could push up that?

5533
04:02:52,240 --> 04:02:53,160
What is that?

5534
04:02:53,260 --> 04:02:53,500
No.

5535
04:02:54,280 --> 04:02:55,240
Wait, what's that for?

5536
04:02:56,460 --> 04:02:57,360
What's what for?

5537
04:03:00,640 --> 04:03:01,820
What was that for?

5538
04:03:09,190 --> 04:03:10,450
What's going on?

5539
04:03:10,450 --> 04:03:11,950
I don't know anymore.

5540
04:03:12,150 --> 04:03:13,390
I'm sad.

5541
04:03:18,530 --> 04:03:19,730
I'm sad.

5542
04:03:22,670 --> 04:03:24,670
I don't know anymore.

5543
04:03:25,610 --> 04:03:26,870
Can I jump from the top of the sign?

5544
04:03:28,170 --> 04:03:29,210
What sign?

5545
04:03:34,930 --> 04:03:35,530
Oh,

5546
04:03:39,770 --> 04:03:40,370
I did it!

5547
04:03:40,450 --> 04:03:41,130
I did

5548
04:03:44,710 --> 04:03:45,170
it!

5549
04:03:45,230 --> 04:03:46,330
I get it.

5550
04:03:46,510 --> 04:03:47,970
I definitely got it this time.

5551
04:04:02,010 --> 04:04:02,370
Wait.

5552
04:04:03,450 --> 04:04:04,010
Wait.

5553
04:04:06,610 --> 04:04:07,170
Okay.

5554
04:04:09,230 --> 04:04:09,790
Okay.

5555
04:04:11,750 --> 04:04:12,930
Okay, and then...

5556
04:04:14,530 --> 04:04:15,090
Okay.

5557
04:04:16,250 --> 04:04:17,490
Wait, how is it?

5558
04:04:18,250 --> 04:04:19,530
Are you also tied to it?

5559
04:04:19,570 --> 04:04:20,250
Oh, you are.

5560
04:04:21,110 --> 04:04:22,110
Okay, and then...

5561
04:04:26,500 --> 04:04:27,900
And then I do...

5562
04:04:34,890 --> 04:04:35,790
Ta-da!

5563
04:04:42,490 --> 04:04:43,630
Ta-da!

5564
04:04:49,970 --> 04:04:52,030
I told you I got it.

5565
04:04:58,470 --> 04:05:01,490
Wait, but I didn't get a chance to do this part.

5566
04:05:01,490 --> 04:05:02,550
I didn't...

5567
04:05:06,270 --> 04:05:08,590
We need me to loop first.

5568
04:05:08,670 --> 04:05:10,530
I didn't get a chance to loop.

5569
04:05:10,690 --> 04:05:13,570
I didn't get a chance to loop the other side.

5570
04:05:17,310 --> 04:05:18,350
Get out!

5571
04:05:18,510 --> 04:05:20,450
I forgot to loop!

5572
04:05:20,850 --> 04:05:22,030
We forgot to loop!

5573
04:05:22,210 --> 04:05:24,680
Get over here!

5574
04:05:25,060 --> 04:05:26,240
I needed to loop.

5575
04:05:26,900 --> 04:05:27,700
Get out!

5576
04:05:27,780 --> 04:05:28,500
Get over here!

5577
04:05:28,600 --> 04:05:29,380
I need to loop!

5578
04:05:41,370 --> 04:05:42,790
Wait, I didn't need to, JK.

5579
04:05:46,590 --> 04:05:47,470
Get over here!

5580
04:05:48,590 --> 04:05:49,970
JK, I just went from under.

5581
04:05:55,270 --> 04:05:55,630
No,

5582
04:05:59,570 --> 04:06:00,130
no, no.

5583
04:06:00,170 --> 04:06:00,790
That's not true.

5584
04:06:00,930 --> 04:06:01,630
That's not true.

5585
04:06:01,810 --> 04:06:02,510
That's not true.

5586
04:06:02,830 --> 04:06:03,910
There, go do your thing!

5587
04:06:04,030 --> 04:06:04,470
Do your thing!

5588
04:06:04,610 --> 04:06:05,030
You got it!

5589
04:06:05,250 --> 04:06:05,730
Go over here!

5590
04:06:05,770 --> 04:06:06,490
Get over here!

5591
04:06:06,610 --> 04:06:07,370
Get over here!

5592
04:06:07,370 --> 04:06:10,470
You gotta be on the other side.

5593
04:06:13,460 --> 04:06:14,430
Are you ready?

5594
04:06:22,550 --> 04:06:23,450
Okay.

5595
04:06:32,450 --> 04:06:35,530
We literally figured it out!

5596
04:06:35,850 --> 04:06:38,290
We literally figured it out!

5597
04:06:38,290 --> 04:06:42,050
How did you not get this swing correct?

5598
04:06:45,310 --> 04:06:47,230
We literally figured it out, Gumi.

5599
04:06:47,410 --> 04:06:49,930
We literally figured it out.

5600
04:06:50,230 --> 04:06:51,530
We figured it out.

5601
04:06:51,610 --> 04:06:52,830
We figured it out.

5602
04:06:54,210 --> 04:06:54,870
Ta-da!

5603
04:06:55,230 --> 04:06:56,670
Let's just keep pulling in, please.

5604
04:06:56,790 --> 04:06:57,250
Ta-da!

5605
04:06:59,010 --> 04:07:00,150
Ta-da!

5606
04:07:08,100 --> 04:07:10,360
Oh my god, I don't wanna...

5607
04:07:11,940 --> 04:07:12,480
Oh my god.

5608
04:07:12,480 --> 04:07:12,860
Where am I?

5609
04:07:13,200 --> 04:07:14,140
Where am I?

5610
04:07:14,780 --> 04:07:15,380
Where am I?

5611
04:07:16,060 --> 04:07:20,180
Where am I?

5612
04:07:20,220 --> 04:07:21,280
I thought I could go up.

5613
04:07:22,220 --> 04:07:23,600
I told you, you couldn't!

5614
04:07:24,780 --> 04:07:25,520
Oh, whoops!

5615
04:07:30,430 --> 04:07:33,230
I told you I didn't bring you up there first!

5616
04:07:34,050 --> 04:07:35,330
All right, that's fine.

5617
04:07:35,550 --> 04:07:36,810
We figured it out.

5618
04:07:47,440 --> 04:07:50,560
All right, now we do this together.

5619
04:07:55,000 --> 04:07:57,660
I figured out the initial solution, though.

5620
04:07:58,680 --> 04:07:59,740
Yeah, I meant...

5621
04:07:59,740 --> 04:08:02,260
Wait, I don't think we're...

5622
04:08:03,820 --> 04:08:04,720
Okay, wait, wait.

5623
04:08:04,760 --> 04:08:05,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5624
04:08:13,250 --> 04:08:14,050
Oh, wait.

5625
04:08:14,290 --> 04:08:15,710
JK, I got it.

5626
04:08:16,830 --> 04:08:18,570
You do your thing first, and then I'll come over.

5627
04:08:22,850 --> 04:08:25,450
You do your thing first.

5628
04:08:26,850 --> 04:08:28,670
We figured out the solution, though.

5629
04:08:36,910 --> 04:08:39,090
All right, now my turn.

5630
04:08:40,570 --> 04:08:42,310
Wait, do you have to get to the other side first?

5631
04:08:44,650 --> 04:08:45,270
Maybe you should get...

5632
04:08:46,090 --> 04:08:47,870
Well, I can't get to the other side unless...

5633
04:09:03,920 --> 04:09:05,420
Should I come down?

5634
04:09:09,270 --> 04:09:10,640
You want me to come down?

5635
04:09:12,720 --> 04:09:14,840
I think the forest is burned down.

5636
04:09:15,260 --> 04:09:20,960
I think the forest is gone.

5637
04:09:25,500 --> 04:09:27,640
There's no forest left.

5638
04:09:27,740 --> 04:09:28,590
There's no...

5639
04:09:33,300 --> 04:09:35,200
I technically figured it out.

5640
04:09:35,900 --> 04:09:39,640
Yeah, I think...

5641
04:09:39,640 --> 04:09:41,840
I don't think we have this forest no more.

5642
04:09:43,140 --> 04:09:44,160
Why do you do that?

5643
04:09:44,240 --> 04:09:45,540
Now how are you gonna get to...

5644
04:09:45,540 --> 04:09:46,380
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

5645
04:09:46,440 --> 04:09:46,960
What are you doing?

5646
04:09:47,620 --> 04:09:48,400
What are you doing?

5647
04:09:49,580 --> 04:09:50,200
Untie it.

5648
04:09:50,320 --> 04:09:51,080
What are you doing?

5649
04:09:51,160 --> 04:09:52,460
You just gotta flip it over.

5650
04:09:57,820 --> 04:10:02,200
New forests will grow by the time they figure out this puzzle.

5651
04:10:03,320 --> 04:10:04,040
Oh, there you go.

5652
04:10:04,100 --> 04:10:05,080
See, look, you're doing it.

5653
04:10:06,340 --> 04:10:07,400
Just gotta climb.

5654
04:10:07,400 --> 04:10:11,130
Can you...

5655
04:10:11,130 --> 04:10:12,690
Can you...

5656
04:10:12,690 --> 04:10:14,270
Can you pull it, please?

5657
04:10:15,090 --> 04:10:15,670
Can you...

5658
04:10:15,670 --> 04:10:17,210
Can you pull it?

5659
04:10:18,230 --> 04:10:19,670
Can you pull it?

5660
04:10:19,710 --> 04:10:20,750
Can you pull...

5661
04:10:20,750 --> 04:10:22,030
Can you pull...

5662
04:10:25,210 --> 04:10:25,970
Nooo!

5663
04:10:33,950 --> 04:10:36,750
I'm pulling a map...

5664
04:10:36,750 --> 04:10:38,250
A map...

5665
04:10:38,250 --> 04:10:39,570
A map trick.

5666
04:10:46,250 --> 04:10:47,970
I need you to go higher.

5667
04:10:48,190 --> 04:10:51,970
I need you to untie that, so I can go down.

5668
04:10:52,190 --> 04:10:57,770
I need you to- the moment I untie this, it's all- I need you- okay, there we go.

5669
04:10:58,810 --> 04:11:00,290
There we go.

5670
04:11:01,090 --> 04:11:02,330
There we go.

5671
04:11:02,870 --> 04:11:04,230
So how do we do this now?

5672
04:11:11,180 --> 04:11:11,980
Um.

5673
04:11:11,980 --> 04:11:13,840
Oh wait, I got an idea.

5674
04:11:14,700 --> 04:11:16,020
I have an idea.

5675
04:11:19,280 --> 04:11:20,420
I have an idea.

5676
04:11:21,280 --> 04:11:22,300
Just chill.

5677
04:11:23,300 --> 04:11:24,200
Just chill.

5678
04:11:24,680 --> 04:11:25,460
And then...

5679
04:11:40,180 --> 04:11:41,980
You shouldn't have untied that.

5680
04:12:09,330 --> 04:12:11,510
I'm having a good time.

5681
04:12:29,460 --> 04:12:31,100
Yeah, let's go!

5682
04:12:43,180 --> 04:12:43,860
No.

5683
04:12:45,900 --> 04:12:47,560
Yeah, see, it was just that easy.

5684
04:12:50,420 --> 04:12:54,160
Okay, the moment- you better untie it after that, right?

5685
04:12:55,120 --> 04:12:56,840
I don't think so.

5686
04:13:00,980 --> 04:13:03,240
I must untie it here, right?

5687
04:13:04,920 --> 04:13:06,760
No, don't!

5688
04:13:09,320 --> 04:13:11,220
Like, untie mid-slide.

5689
04:13:17,080 --> 04:13:20,760
I'm pulling as much as I could down here right now.

5690
04:13:21,740 --> 04:13:22,340
Do it.

5691
04:13:22,440 --> 04:13:22,760
I believe.

5692
04:13:22,920 --> 04:13:24,280
I believe the mid-slide.

5693
04:13:27,420 --> 04:13:29,720
I believe this is it.

5694
04:13:32,140 --> 04:13:34,320
Oh, JK, I didn't need to do the- wait, wait, wait.

5695
04:13:35,380 --> 04:13:35,860
Unless...

5696
04:13:35,860 --> 04:13:41,200
No, I can't tie it, guys, because- because, like, I don't know if I'm gonna be able to untie it.

5697
04:13:41,200 --> 04:13:42,040
I don't have enough string.

5698
04:13:44,900 --> 04:13:45,800
This is it.

5699
04:13:47,080 --> 04:13:47,640
Aww.

5700
04:13:48,320 --> 04:13:51,260
All I was saying is you should have untied it mid-swing.

5701
04:14:05,450 --> 04:14:06,570
I believe.

5702
04:14:07,950 --> 04:14:09,230
I believe in you.

5703
04:14:09,810 --> 04:14:11,410
I believe in you, Gumi.

5704
04:14:20,530 --> 04:14:22,610
Oh, I figured it out.

5705
04:14:22,790 --> 04:14:24,670
You said that, like, three times.

5706
04:14:26,730 --> 04:14:28,070
I'm untying it.

5707
04:14:35,910 --> 04:14:37,770
I figured it out for real, though.

5708
04:14:45,440 --> 04:14:46,420
Okay, push it.

5709
04:14:54,760 --> 04:14:55,520
Okay, wait.

5710
04:14:56,540 --> 04:14:56,980
Wait.

5711
04:14:57,600 --> 04:14:59,760
I need- I- okay, let's do that again.

5712
04:14:59,760 --> 04:15:00,900
Okay, do it.

5713
04:15:11,690 --> 04:15:12,850
How much string do I get?

5714
04:15:13,690 --> 04:15:15,350
How much string do I get from this?

5715
04:15:19,230 --> 04:15:20,530
That's not a lot of string.

5716
04:15:24,270 --> 04:15:24,670
Wait.

5717
04:15:24,670 --> 04:15:25,870
Wait, give me a sec.

5718
04:15:27,210 --> 04:15:27,610
Wait.

5719
04:15:32,930 --> 04:15:33,990
Give me a sec.

5720
04:15:34,770 --> 04:15:35,770
Give me a sec.

5721
04:15:35,970 --> 04:15:36,870
I need- I'm thinking.

5722
04:15:37,850 --> 04:15:39,090
Maybe I might tie this.

5723
04:15:40,750 --> 04:15:41,450
Oh, okay.

5724
04:15:45,420 --> 04:15:46,680
Get on the stump.

5725
04:15:50,470 --> 04:15:51,250
Oh, wait.

5726
04:15:51,290 --> 04:15:52,450
What if I just- wait.

5727
04:15:58,890 --> 04:15:59,670
All right.

5728
04:16:09,410 --> 04:16:10,010
Hello.

5729
04:16:26,780 --> 04:16:29,120
Hey, you enjoying your life here?

5730
04:16:38,220 --> 04:16:40,460
No, no, no, no, no, no!

5731
04:16:42,740 --> 04:16:45,180
Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go.

5732
04:16:46,280 --> 04:16:46,740
Oh, hey.

5733
04:16:48,640 --> 04:16:49,560
Now I'm trapped.

5734
04:16:54,060 --> 04:16:55,960
What if I do this?

5735
04:16:56,860 --> 04:16:57,330
And then...

5736
04:16:58,390 --> 04:17:01,970
That's the same thing that you just did and you're so unexpectable!

5737
04:17:10,110 --> 04:17:10,570
Okay.

5738
04:17:15,270 --> 04:17:19,310
Okay, but what if I- but what if I do this?

5739
04:17:20,770 --> 04:17:22,770
What if I do that, you see?

5740
04:17:25,570 --> 04:17:27,590
And then you push, push it, push it.

5741
04:17:35,470 --> 04:17:37,330
Wait, how come I can't move more?

5742
04:17:41,540 --> 04:17:43,300
Wait, why did you do that?

5743
04:17:46,940 --> 04:17:47,660
Wait, wait.

5744
04:17:49,600 --> 04:17:50,440
Tie it?

5745
04:17:54,300 --> 04:17:55,580
Yeah, but I don't have enough.

5746
04:17:59,260 --> 04:18:00,860
I don't have enough now.

5747
04:18:03,360 --> 04:18:04,780
I don't have enough.

5748
04:18:06,200 --> 04:18:07,280
What do I do?

5749
04:18:11,600 --> 04:18:12,860
What do I do?

5750
04:18:16,390 --> 04:18:17,730
What do I do?

5751
04:18:18,890 --> 04:18:20,930
What about me?

5752
04:18:23,870 --> 04:18:25,510
Can you try getting up here?

5753
04:18:32,030 --> 04:18:34,230
Oh, hey, I could swing all the way back there.

5754
04:18:39,340 --> 04:18:39,960
Wait.

5755
04:18:48,840 --> 04:18:51,400
No, I can't.

5756
04:18:53,200 --> 04:18:53,720
For me.

5757
04:18:55,380 --> 04:18:56,340
For me.

5758
04:18:59,560 --> 04:19:00,780
For me.

5759
04:19:22,200 --> 04:19:25,280
Get up here.

5760
04:19:26,300 --> 04:19:27,000
How?

5761
04:19:29,560 --> 04:19:29,960
Hello.

5762
04:19:32,540 --> 04:19:33,440
Oh, hey.

5763
04:19:34,500 --> 04:19:35,500
No, we can't.

5764
04:19:44,270 --> 04:19:46,190
Why did we swap places?

5765
04:19:53,760 --> 04:19:54,480
Okay,

5766
04:19:58,000 --> 04:19:59,820
I'm gonna set up the thingy for you.

5767
04:20:00,580 --> 04:20:00,960
Okay.

5768
04:20:00,960 --> 04:20:01,160
Okay.

5769
04:20:08,330 --> 04:20:08,870
Okay.

5770
04:20:09,830 --> 04:20:11,390
It's held down for you now.

5771
04:20:12,690 --> 04:20:13,570
What do I do?

5772
04:20:15,470 --> 04:20:16,450
What do you want me to do?

5773
04:20:16,510 --> 04:20:17,030
Jump over?

5774
04:20:20,030 --> 04:20:20,570
So...

5775
04:20:27,640 --> 04:20:28,180
Well...

5776
04:20:29,000 --> 04:20:29,800
You mean?

5777
04:20:30,240 --> 04:20:30,520
Yeah.

5778
04:20:34,280 --> 04:20:35,340
And that's all I have.

5779
04:20:43,030 --> 04:20:44,890
And then you can go up.

5780
04:20:45,710 --> 04:20:46,630
Get on though.

5781
04:20:55,760 --> 04:20:57,260
And tie it again.

5782
04:21:02,860 --> 04:21:04,220
Can you go around?

5783
04:21:04,760 --> 04:21:05,220
Yeah.

5784
04:21:12,800 --> 04:21:13,500
Hello.

5785
04:21:29,020 --> 04:21:29,640
Yeah?

5786
04:21:30,440 --> 04:21:33,720
Okay, I need you to come all the way over here.

5787
04:21:34,300 --> 04:21:34,860
Okay.

5788
04:21:37,160 --> 04:21:39,740
Can you jump on the top of that right here?

5789
04:21:40,440 --> 04:21:40,860
Yeah.

5790
04:21:42,020 --> 04:21:43,940
And then grab onto the thingy.

5791
04:21:47,040 --> 04:21:47,660
Yeah.

5792
04:21:56,960 --> 04:22:00,500
I think you're making it unnecessarily more complicated.

5793
04:22:03,820 --> 04:22:04,720
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

5794
04:22:04,720 --> 04:22:06,680
I think that's the closest we've ever gotten.

5795
04:22:07,060 --> 04:22:09,200
Wait, wait, wait, I think we... I got it, I got it.

5796
04:22:09,260 --> 04:22:11,520
Okay, and then I'll let go after that.

5797
04:22:11,980 --> 04:22:12,980
So then you'd have more...

5798
04:22:14,640 --> 04:22:15,720
After you do your thing.

5799
04:22:15,940 --> 04:22:17,680
I don't think letting go is the answer.

5800
04:22:17,960 --> 04:22:19,060
No, to give you more string.

5801
04:22:19,180 --> 04:22:20,660
I'm gonna let go so you get more string.

5802
04:22:21,240 --> 04:22:21,540
Right?

5803
04:22:23,900 --> 04:22:25,240
Because you didn't have enough string, right?

5804
04:22:25,300 --> 04:22:26,320
And then I'll let go and then...

5805
04:22:27,360 --> 04:22:29,660
Oh my god, oh my god, we did it.

5806
04:22:30,500 --> 04:22:30,940
We...

5807
04:22:57,660 --> 04:23:00,060
Was that even the right answer?

5808
04:23:00,440 --> 04:23:01,920
Like, did we brute force that?

5809
04:23:02,180 --> 04:23:03,100
I'm pretty sure it was.

5810
04:23:03,120 --> 04:23:05,300
I'm pretty sure it was the right answer.

5811
04:23:09,740 --> 04:23:11,540
We made it out.

5812
04:23:12,360 --> 04:23:14,960
I reached a point in my head of clarity.

5813
04:23:16,960 --> 04:23:19,220
I like, went into nirvana or something.

5814
04:23:19,240 --> 04:23:20,740
No, we brute forced it.

5815
04:23:20,840 --> 04:23:23,320
We actually brute forced it.

5816
04:23:23,540 --> 04:23:26,600
That wasn't even the solution.

5817
04:23:30,280 --> 04:23:33,840
We'll never know what the real answer was.

5818
04:23:34,220 --> 04:23:35,600
We'll never know.

5819
04:23:36,420 --> 04:23:38,120
We'll never know.

5820
04:23:38,780 --> 04:23:39,260
What?

5821
04:23:41,120 --> 04:23:43,200
Wait, you watched a YouTube video?

5822
04:23:43,580 --> 04:23:45,160
No, no, I'm asking, can we...

5823
04:23:45,780 --> 04:23:47,080
Yeah, yeah, we'll see.

5824
04:23:47,360 --> 04:23:49,720
Let's watch the YouTube video and see what the real...

5825
04:23:52,180 --> 04:23:55,560
Oh my god, what was the real answer?

5826
04:23:56,840 --> 04:23:57,880
Wait, we both...

5827
04:23:57,880 --> 04:23:59,620
You can't grasp on me or like...

5828
04:23:59,620 --> 04:24:00,900
We have to both get that.

5829
04:24:01,060 --> 04:24:01,360
Or we...

5830
04:24:02,720 --> 04:24:04,400
We can't swing, I think.

5831
04:24:04,940 --> 04:24:05,560
What are you doing?

5832
04:24:08,660 --> 04:24:09,580
Wait, what?

5833
04:24:10,620 --> 04:24:12,540
Or maybe I have to be there for you.

5834
04:24:13,340 --> 04:24:13,900
Right?

5835
04:24:16,480 --> 04:24:17,400
I don't know.

5836
04:24:18,600 --> 04:24:19,980
Here, go.

5837
04:24:24,650 --> 04:24:24,910
Woo!

5838
04:24:25,410 --> 04:24:26,170
Yeah, but how about you?

5839
04:24:32,230 --> 04:24:34,590
Why are you going so far away?

5840
04:24:36,130 --> 04:24:38,110
There we go, we did it!

5841
04:24:38,770 --> 04:24:40,970
I can't believe we brute-forced that.

5842
04:24:44,770 --> 04:24:46,330
It's actually crazy.

5843
04:24:47,170 --> 04:24:49,030
Wait, how come I can't get that jump?

5844
04:24:53,820 --> 04:24:54,400
There you go.

5845
04:24:55,120 --> 04:24:55,820
I did it.

5846
04:24:56,080 --> 04:24:56,860
Oh, okay, here.

5847
04:24:58,380 --> 04:24:58,960
Wait, what?

5848
04:24:59,760 --> 04:25:01,720
No, I think you just swing on my side, right?

5849
04:25:03,360 --> 04:25:04,000
Just swing.

5850
04:25:04,940 --> 04:25:05,600
I'll hold you.

5851
04:25:14,430 --> 04:25:15,110
Oh, too low.

5852
04:25:15,130 --> 04:25:15,490
Okay.

5853
04:25:21,800 --> 04:25:22,720
I'm holding.

5854
04:25:22,940 --> 04:25:23,500
I'm holding.

5855
04:25:26,880 --> 04:25:27,840
I'm holding.

5856
04:25:29,500 --> 04:25:30,980
I'm still holding.

5857
04:25:31,640 --> 04:25:32,200
Okay.

5858
04:25:33,360 --> 04:25:33,740
Hold.

5859
04:25:33,740 --> 04:25:35,720
I'm literally not holding any other button.

5860
04:25:36,180 --> 04:25:36,740
Hold!

5861
04:25:38,400 --> 04:25:38,960
Hold!

5862
04:25:43,090 --> 04:25:45,370
I think you have to let go when I get over here.

5863
04:25:46,090 --> 04:25:46,530
Do it.

5864
04:25:46,810 --> 04:25:47,270
Let go!

5865
04:25:47,890 --> 04:25:48,910
I did it.

5866
04:25:49,090 --> 04:25:49,970
Then what do I do?

5867
04:25:52,570 --> 04:25:54,250
Oh, you gotta hit that.

5868
04:25:59,500 --> 04:26:00,220
Hey, see?

5869
04:26:00,340 --> 04:26:00,800
Look at that!

5870
04:26:00,880 --> 04:26:02,120
See, the forest is still okay.

5871
04:26:03,400 --> 04:26:05,260
I don't think it looks very okay.

5872
04:26:05,340 --> 04:26:06,460
The forest is still okay.

5873
04:26:06,680 --> 04:26:07,380
We might...

5874
04:26:07,380 --> 04:26:10,300
Kumi, I just want you to know that...

5875
04:26:11,120 --> 04:26:12,500
We gotta work together for this.

5876
04:26:12,960 --> 04:26:14,180
That puzzle took us an hour.

5877
04:26:18,040 --> 04:26:20,940
Wait, how do we get there?

5878
04:26:21,340 --> 04:26:22,140
Oh, you just swing.

5879
04:26:22,840 --> 04:26:23,240
Oh, you just swing.

5880
04:26:37,380 --> 04:26:38,580
My turn!

5881
04:26:40,780 --> 04:26:41,380
Woooooooo!

5882
04:26:43,860 --> 04:26:44,900
I don't think...

5883
04:26:44,900 --> 04:26:47,420
Oh, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

5884
04:26:47,800 --> 04:26:48,840
Get in, get in!

5885
04:26:51,440 --> 04:26:52,040
Okay.

5886
04:26:56,100 --> 04:26:57,100
How do we do this?

5887
04:26:57,660 --> 04:26:58,060
Get out.

5888
04:27:06,320 --> 04:27:06,660
Okay.

5889
04:27:07,000 --> 04:27:07,880
My turn!

5890
04:27:08,520 --> 04:27:09,120
Woooooo!

5891
04:27:10,460 --> 04:27:11,400
Your turn.

5892
04:27:14,060 --> 04:27:15,220
My turn!

5893
04:27:17,420 --> 04:27:18,000
Yippee!

5894
04:27:18,580 --> 04:27:19,640
This is a great game.

5895
04:27:19,980 --> 04:27:21,680
I'm glad you suggested this.

5896
04:27:31,400 --> 04:27:32,860
Oh my god!

5897
04:27:33,120 --> 04:27:34,620
Oh my god, there's a meese!

5898
04:27:38,460 --> 04:27:39,960
Why are you so slow?

5899
04:27:40,240 --> 04:27:40,800
Why?

5900
04:27:41,020 --> 04:27:41,780
Why are you so slow?

5901
04:27:42,540 --> 04:27:45,600
Cuz you got a lot of momentum from swinging forward!

5902
04:27:45,920 --> 04:27:46,980
How did you walk over?

5903
04:27:47,420 --> 04:27:47,820
Wow!

5904
04:27:49,060 --> 04:27:49,500
Whoops.

5905
04:27:50,380 --> 04:27:51,860
I got a little too excited.

5906
04:27:55,640 --> 04:27:57,320
Why didn't it get into the...

5907
04:27:57,320 --> 04:27:59,000
Why didn't it get into the cabin?

5908
04:28:01,840 --> 04:28:02,940
I don't understand.

5909
04:28:03,700 --> 04:28:06,300
There's like nothing inside there that's important, right?

5910
04:28:08,880 --> 04:28:09,360
Oh.

5911
04:28:09,620 --> 04:28:11,180
I think because there's no other way out.

5912
04:28:12,120 --> 04:28:12,980
Oh, maybe.

5913
04:28:14,180 --> 04:28:15,600
That's why they're going on the other side.

5914
04:28:15,720 --> 04:28:16,560
I see now.

5915
04:28:18,000 --> 04:28:18,400
Ah!

5916
04:28:18,980 --> 04:28:19,900
Okay, it's fine.

5917
04:28:20,080 --> 04:28:20,660
It's fine.

5918
04:28:20,780 --> 04:28:21,940
My wife's got me.

5919
04:28:29,050 --> 04:28:29,610
All right.

5920
04:28:29,750 --> 04:28:29,950
Oh!

5921
04:28:30,730 --> 04:28:31,130
No,

5922
04:28:39,060 --> 04:28:39,400
it's not.

5923
04:28:41,600 --> 04:28:42,360
No, it's not.

5924
04:28:42,420 --> 04:28:43,000
See, we're fine.

5925
04:28:43,760 --> 04:28:44,420
Oh, it's not.

5926
04:28:44,500 --> 04:28:45,560
No, it's coming over.

5927
04:28:45,660 --> 04:28:46,380
We're not fine.

5928
04:28:46,480 --> 04:28:47,140
We're not fine.

5929
04:28:47,260 --> 04:28:48,120
It's heading over.

5930
04:28:49,260 --> 04:28:50,020
Take the jump.

5931
04:28:50,140 --> 04:28:51,060
Make the jump of faith.

5932
04:28:53,040 --> 04:28:54,240
Go, go, go, go, go.

5933
04:28:54,280 --> 04:28:54,700
We got...

5934
04:28:55,280 --> 04:28:56,860
Go, go, go, go, go.

5935
04:28:57,340 --> 04:28:58,300
We lost some...

5936
04:28:58,300 --> 04:28:59,500
We lost some time.

5937
04:29:01,460 --> 04:29:02,340
Oh, fuck.

5938
04:29:02,360 --> 04:29:02,880
Oh, shit.

5939
04:29:03,020 --> 04:29:03,880
Okay, we lost time.

5940
04:29:03,960 --> 04:29:05,420
We got our speed run.

5941
04:29:06,780 --> 04:29:09,160
We lost time from our speed run because...

5942
04:29:09,160 --> 04:29:10,960
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

5943
04:29:13,700 --> 04:29:14,440
Wait, what?

5944
04:29:16,480 --> 04:29:16,880
What?

5945
04:29:23,160 --> 04:29:26,500
Oh, pull, pull, pull, pull, pull, pull, pull, pull.

5946
04:29:28,040 --> 04:29:29,200
Do not pull that.

5947
04:29:30,340 --> 04:29:32,180
No, you have to get on...

5948
04:29:32,180 --> 04:29:35,020
And then you swing over to that second one.

5949
04:29:35,260 --> 04:29:35,640
Oh!

5950
04:29:37,540 --> 04:29:39,360
Oh, this fire is gonna kill us.

5951
04:29:42,760 --> 04:29:43,460
And then what?

5952
04:29:45,040 --> 04:29:45,560
Oh!

5953
04:29:46,340 --> 04:29:46,860
Oh, shit.

5954
04:29:47,380 --> 04:29:48,560
We did it.

5955
04:29:49,200 --> 04:29:51,100
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

5956
04:29:55,280 --> 04:29:55,740
Nice.

5957
04:29:57,540 --> 04:29:58,500
Look, look at that.

5958
04:29:58,840 --> 04:29:59,540
Saving time.

5959
04:29:59,640 --> 04:30:00,420
We're saving time.

5960
04:30:01,060 --> 04:30:01,780
We're saving time.

5961
04:30:01,880 --> 04:30:02,920
No, free the horses!

5962
04:30:04,100 --> 04:30:05,660
Somebody free the horses!

5963
04:30:06,100 --> 04:30:06,320
The shiny!

5964
04:30:06,820 --> 04:30:07,500
The shiny!

5965
04:30:07,960 --> 04:30:08,800
Somebody free...

5966
04:30:08,800 --> 04:30:10,020
The horse is more important!

5967
04:30:13,140 --> 04:30:14,200
Quick, quick, quick!

5968
04:30:14,600 --> 04:30:15,960
We gotta save the horse!

5969
04:30:18,920 --> 04:30:20,060
What do we do after that?

5970
04:30:24,110 --> 04:30:24,630
Oh!

5971
04:30:24,630 --> 04:30:25,170
What the fuck?

5972
04:30:26,870 --> 04:30:28,230
We scare the horses?

5973
04:30:30,250 --> 04:30:30,770
Oh!

5974
04:30:32,110 --> 04:30:32,930
Wait, what?

5975
04:30:33,070 --> 04:30:33,850
Oh, you might...

5976
04:30:34,730 --> 04:30:36,150
We gotta figure out how to...

5977
04:30:37,170 --> 04:30:38,130
No, not...

5978
04:30:38,130 --> 04:30:38,390
No.

5979
04:30:40,830 --> 04:30:42,310
We gotta push the hose.

5980
04:30:45,270 --> 04:30:46,710
How do we push the hose?

5981
04:30:46,890 --> 04:30:47,550
Yeah, yeah, drop.

5982
04:30:47,950 --> 04:30:48,830
Oh, there it is!

5983
04:30:49,690 --> 04:30:50,450
Use the momentum!

5984
04:30:52,590 --> 04:30:53,690
We did it!

5985
04:30:57,270 --> 04:30:59,390
Oh, that's what the children were doing!

5986
04:30:59,490 --> 04:31:00,770
They were trying to save the horses!

5987
04:31:04,430 --> 04:31:04,950
Wow!

5988
04:31:05,390 --> 04:31:06,570
Those are good kids.

5989
04:31:06,690 --> 04:31:07,390
Good kids.

5990
04:31:08,010 --> 04:31:09,130
And there's us.

5991
04:31:10,130 --> 04:31:10,590
Shiny!

5992
04:31:15,130 --> 04:31:15,650
Shiny!

5993
04:31:17,490 --> 04:31:18,530
We did it!

5994
04:31:18,570 --> 04:31:20,610
We saved the horse to save the world!

5995
04:31:22,150 --> 04:31:24,590
We'll never know what the...

5996
04:31:25,530 --> 04:31:27,330
Another chapter has to be a short one, right?

5997
04:31:27,390 --> 04:31:28,010
Because we did it.

5998
04:31:28,070 --> 04:31:28,970
We saved everything.

5999
04:31:32,950 --> 04:31:35,490
Honestly, I think if we did not get stuck in that one puzzle...

6000
04:31:35,490 --> 04:31:37,030
We would have finished the game a lot earlier.

6001
04:31:41,810 --> 04:31:45,630
It's always that one puzzle.

6002
04:31:46,090 --> 04:31:49,150
That one puzzle really fucked us up.

6003
04:31:57,060 --> 04:31:58,100
Oh my god!

6004
04:31:58,340 --> 04:31:58,820
Last...

6005
04:31:58,820 --> 04:31:59,900
Last chapter!

6006
04:32:07,300 --> 04:32:08,260
They're closed?

6007
04:32:10,420 --> 04:32:11,720
Oh my god, what day is today?

6008
04:32:12,100 --> 04:32:12,840
It's Tuesday.

6009
04:32:13,020 --> 04:32:17,820
I don't know why, but a lot of Asian restaurants near me close on Tuesdays.

6010
04:32:17,900 --> 04:32:18,320
That's weird.

6011
04:32:19,900 --> 04:32:22,960
I thought they'd be open later, because usually they are.

6012
04:32:23,480 --> 04:32:23,860
It's aren't they?

6013
04:32:23,880 --> 04:32:25,060
It's definitely Tuesdays.

6014
04:32:25,680 --> 04:32:27,600
Maybe it's like a break day on Tuesday.

6015
04:32:28,020 --> 04:32:29,060
Up, up, up, up.

6016
04:32:29,660 --> 04:32:30,520
Up, goomy up.

6017
04:32:31,340 --> 04:32:32,120
Up, up, up, up.

6018
04:32:33,780 --> 04:32:34,620
Last chapter.

6019
04:32:34,760 --> 04:32:35,840
Oh, whoa, whoa.

6020
04:32:35,900 --> 04:32:37,300
You fucking went in without me.

6021
04:32:41,960 --> 04:32:45,220
Oh my god, we can be in 11th place on the leaderboards!

6022
04:32:45,640 --> 04:32:46,560
For the speedrun!

6023
04:32:47,420 --> 04:32:47,680
Wow!

6024
04:32:50,720 --> 04:32:54,140
Oh, it does, yeah.

6025
04:32:55,340 --> 04:32:56,140
Look shiny!

6026
04:32:57,200 --> 04:32:58,720
All right, your last shiny of the day.

6027
04:32:59,340 --> 04:33:00,800
God, I wish I could cut the rope.

6028
04:33:04,340 --> 04:33:05,220
Cut the rope?

6029
04:33:05,660 --> 04:33:06,080
I'm gonna do it.

6030
04:33:06,940 --> 04:33:07,700
I'm gonna cut the rope.

6031
04:33:10,200 --> 04:33:10,940
Look, see?

6032
04:33:11,120 --> 04:33:11,780
I told you.

6033
04:33:11,840 --> 04:33:12,920
The forest fire stopped.

6034
04:33:13,300 --> 04:33:13,960
We did it.

6035
04:33:15,760 --> 04:33:16,560
Don't be dis...

6036
04:33:16,560 --> 04:33:16,780
Oh.

6037
04:33:19,380 --> 04:33:21,160
How was I supposed to know?

6038
04:33:23,140 --> 04:33:24,420
Okay, that's on you.

6039
04:33:24,480 --> 04:33:25,120
I stopped.

6040
04:33:25,120 --> 04:33:27,960
I stopped after that.

6041
04:33:29,640 --> 04:33:30,080
Here.

6042
04:33:31,280 --> 04:33:32,600
It's literally that easy.

6043
04:33:33,100 --> 04:33:33,540
It's...

6044
04:33:33,540 --> 04:33:34,020
My momentum.

6045
04:33:34,400 --> 04:33:35,080
My momentum!

6046
04:33:35,920 --> 04:33:36,580
It's on you.

6047
04:33:37,940 --> 04:33:39,140
I guess you'll just drown.

6048
04:33:40,360 --> 04:33:41,740
And then, we have to do it again.

6049
04:33:43,900 --> 04:33:45,620
Oh my god, this is on you.

6050
04:33:45,680 --> 04:33:46,180
This is on you.

6051
04:33:46,500 --> 04:33:46,900
This is...

6052
04:33:47,980 --> 04:33:49,180
That was on you.

6053
04:33:49,240 --> 04:33:49,800
That was on you.

6054
04:33:49,840 --> 04:33:50,300
That was on you.

6055
04:33:50,340 --> 04:33:51,480
I had the momentum.

6056
04:33:52,320 --> 04:33:53,140
Right there.

6057
04:33:53,500 --> 04:33:54,180
I died...

6058
04:33:55,120 --> 04:33:55,660
There you go.

6059
04:33:55,760 --> 04:33:56,530
That's how you do it.

6060
04:33:58,420 --> 04:33:58,920
I...

6061
04:34:00,980 --> 04:34:02,540
We gotta work...

6062
04:34:02,540 --> 04:34:03,980
We gotta work together.

6063
04:34:13,580 --> 04:34:14,580
It's easier.

6064
04:34:14,740 --> 04:34:15,360
It's easier.

6065
04:34:15,640 --> 04:34:15,880
It's...

6066
04:34:15,880 --> 04:34:16,180
You're...

6067
04:34:16,180 --> 04:34:17,540
You're literally better at this than me.

6068
04:34:21,820 --> 04:34:22,320
How?

6069
04:34:24,120 --> 04:34:27,280
Oh, I think...

6070
04:34:27,280 --> 04:34:28,480
I think you're better at it.

6071
04:34:28,500 --> 04:34:28,980
Than me.

6072
04:34:30,680 --> 04:34:31,440
You're lucky.

6073
04:34:31,720 --> 04:34:32,700
Oh my god, you're lucky.

6074
04:34:32,820 --> 04:34:33,860
I want to finish this game.

6075
04:34:38,440 --> 04:34:39,920
It looks like...

6076
04:34:39,920 --> 04:34:41,040
It looks like I'm not better.

6077
04:34:44,980 --> 04:34:46,560
Oh, I got stuck on the first one.

6078
04:34:49,460 --> 04:34:50,180
Your turn.

6079
04:34:52,560 --> 04:34:53,340
Your turn.

6080
04:34:57,060 --> 04:34:58,020
I guess...

6081
04:34:58,020 --> 04:35:00,360
I guess we just gotta do it ourselves.

6082
04:35:02,660 --> 04:35:03,240
Oh.

6083
04:35:14,920 --> 04:35:16,960
What the fuck is the story?

6084
04:35:19,100 --> 04:35:19,980
There's a fire.

6085
04:35:20,360 --> 04:35:20,920
I fucking...

6086
04:35:20,920 --> 04:35:21,500
I don't know.

6087
04:35:21,800 --> 04:35:22,720
I thought you'd be...

6088
04:35:22,720 --> 04:35:25,180
Everyone knows I don't pay attention that much.

6089
04:35:26,260 --> 04:35:26,840
Whoa.

6090
04:35:26,840 --> 04:35:29,380
Oh, they're still chasing after the kids?

6091
04:35:30,720 --> 04:35:32,820
Bro, I would too if they burned down entire place.

6092
04:35:35,480 --> 04:35:36,680
I mean, to be fair, yeah.

6093
04:35:36,800 --> 04:35:38,540
Like, they're literally criminals at that point.

6094
04:35:39,500 --> 04:35:40,560
Those children are criminals.

6095
04:35:40,740 --> 04:35:41,980
We gotta get them.

6096
04:35:51,780 --> 04:35:52,580
What's this?

6097
04:35:56,700 --> 04:35:57,020
Oh.

6098
04:36:02,700 --> 04:36:03,140
Okay.

6099
04:36:05,320 --> 04:36:06,760
I can't push it no more.

6100
04:36:08,720 --> 04:36:09,840
That's the most I can push.

6101
04:36:11,200 --> 04:36:13,260
Oh, then we'll jump that side?

6102
04:36:14,120 --> 04:36:14,420
No.

6103
04:36:14,880 --> 04:36:15,160
No.

6104
04:36:16,980 --> 04:36:18,980
I can only push it like this.

6105
04:36:26,000 --> 04:36:26,560
Uh...

6106
04:36:26,560 --> 04:36:28,060
Yeah, you still have to wall jump.

6107
04:36:28,620 --> 04:36:29,340
Go under?

6108
04:36:32,640 --> 04:36:33,760
Or well...

6109
04:36:33,760 --> 04:36:34,400
No.

6110
04:36:35,380 --> 04:36:36,340
But that's good enough.

6111
04:36:38,960 --> 04:36:40,420
Okay, well now...

6112
04:36:40,420 --> 04:36:40,720
No.

6113
04:36:43,520 --> 04:36:45,320
Oh, oh, I get it.

6114
04:36:45,360 --> 04:36:46,220
Okay, and then...

6115
04:36:46,220 --> 04:36:47,040
I get it.

6116
04:36:49,760 --> 04:36:50,940
Oh, I already...

6117
04:36:52,020 --> 04:36:52,820
Then what?

6118
04:36:52,900 --> 04:36:53,160
Okay.

6119
04:36:55,360 --> 04:36:56,460
Then what do I do?

6120
04:37:07,520 --> 04:37:08,040
Yeah?

6121
04:37:22,320 --> 04:37:22,800
Uh...

6122
04:37:27,540 --> 04:37:28,500
Maybe like...

6123
04:37:31,670 --> 04:37:32,630
Maybe like...

6124
04:37:32,630 --> 04:37:33,290
Okay, wait.

6125
04:37:33,410 --> 04:37:34,510
Maybe we do loop it.

6126
04:37:34,690 --> 04:37:35,410
Do we loop it?

6127
04:37:39,620 --> 04:37:40,320
Oh, wait.

6128
04:37:40,360 --> 04:37:41,060
I got it.

6129
04:37:41,660 --> 04:37:42,100
Wait.

6130
04:37:44,940 --> 04:37:45,560
Wait, no.

6131
04:37:45,620 --> 04:37:47,640
You go back to the other side and I'll pull it.

6132
04:37:49,500 --> 04:37:50,600
Can I pull you?

6133
04:37:55,660 --> 04:37:56,140
Okay.

6134
04:37:56,140 --> 04:37:56,780
Whoa!

6135
04:38:00,060 --> 04:38:01,340
This is bad.

6136
04:38:07,170 --> 04:38:08,470
Maybe do this side.

6137
04:38:09,410 --> 04:38:10,750
Well, it has to be over.

6138
04:38:10,970 --> 04:38:12,950
The rope has to be over for you to pull me up.

6139
04:38:13,030 --> 04:38:13,950
Oh, you're right.

6140
04:38:14,750 --> 04:38:16,230
Why'd you go on this side?

6141
04:38:16,510 --> 04:38:17,370
I don't know.

6142
04:38:18,250 --> 04:38:18,830
All right.

6143
04:38:25,370 --> 04:38:26,210
Oh, there you go.

6144
04:38:26,350 --> 04:38:26,890
We did it.

6145
04:38:28,490 --> 04:38:29,570
Can you pull me up?

6146
04:38:30,410 --> 04:38:30,810
Oh, wait.

6147
04:38:35,920 --> 04:38:36,900
Push it?

6148
04:38:39,200 --> 04:38:39,820
Yeah.

6149
04:38:40,400 --> 04:38:41,080
Oh.

6150
04:38:43,300 --> 04:38:43,980
Yeah.

6151
04:38:44,040 --> 04:38:45,460
My rope's gonna get tangled.

6152
04:38:46,380 --> 04:38:47,140
Is it tangled?

6153
04:38:47,960 --> 04:38:49,700
Yeah, my rope is gonna get tangled.

6154
04:38:51,600 --> 04:38:52,280
Oh.

6155
04:38:54,820 --> 04:38:55,500
Then...

6156
04:38:55,500 --> 04:38:56,760
What do I do?

6157
04:38:57,040 --> 04:38:57,460
Pull me.

6158
04:38:58,760 --> 04:38:59,600
Oh, okay.

6159
04:39:04,760 --> 04:39:05,960
What's this then?

6160
04:39:07,440 --> 04:39:08,580
What's this for?

6161
04:39:11,780 --> 04:39:12,100
Oh.

6162
04:39:12,100 --> 04:39:13,020
What's that for then?

6163
04:39:13,380 --> 04:39:13,840
Hold on.

6164
04:39:14,040 --> 04:39:14,880
No, you need to push it.

6165
04:39:14,960 --> 04:39:15,740
No, you gotta push this.

6166
04:39:15,820 --> 04:39:16,560
You gotta push it.

6167
04:39:20,150 --> 04:39:21,770
Yeah, and then I'll pull you back up.

6168
04:39:23,910 --> 04:39:25,150
I need to pull you back up.

6169
04:39:25,210 --> 04:39:26,310
I need to pull you up, I think.

6170
04:39:27,170 --> 04:39:27,490
Yeah.

6171
04:39:30,170 --> 04:39:31,410
Okay, then what does that do?

6172
04:39:34,490 --> 04:39:35,610
We have this.

6173
04:39:39,690 --> 04:39:41,650
Watch him pop the wheel thingy.

6174
04:39:43,430 --> 04:39:44,710
Where's the wheel thingy?

6175
04:39:45,270 --> 04:39:45,810
Up there.

6176
04:39:46,850 --> 04:39:48,610
Oh, there's a wheel thingy up here.

6177
04:39:51,570 --> 04:39:51,830
Okay.

6178
04:39:53,790 --> 04:39:54,890
Okay, we need to push it.

6179
04:39:54,990 --> 04:39:55,870
We need to push it again.

6180
04:39:58,130 --> 04:39:58,530
Okay.

6181
04:39:59,050 --> 04:40:01,050
I'm gonna stand on it and you push it.

6182
04:40:01,810 --> 04:40:03,730
I'm gonna stand on it and you push it.

6183
04:40:03,890 --> 04:40:04,390
Push what?

6184
04:40:04,630 --> 04:40:05,030
This?

6185
04:40:05,430 --> 04:40:05,590
Yeah.

6186
04:40:05,610 --> 04:40:06,830
Yeah, because...

6187
04:40:06,830 --> 04:40:07,050
No.

6188
04:40:07,550 --> 04:40:09,110
No, it goes with the wheel.

6189
04:40:09,450 --> 04:40:11,910
The wheel needs to be closer to the left wall.

6190
04:40:13,690 --> 04:40:14,210
No.

6191
04:40:18,780 --> 04:40:20,020
I'll stand on it.

6192
04:40:23,400 --> 04:40:23,920
No.

6193
04:40:24,580 --> 04:40:25,280
I feel like...

6194
04:40:25,280 --> 04:40:25,960
Okay, now stand on it.

6195
04:40:26,500 --> 04:40:26,980
Now stand...

6196
04:40:34,130 --> 04:40:34,870
Go up.

6197
04:40:35,290 --> 04:40:35,810
Go up.

6198
04:40:36,070 --> 04:40:38,090
Go up and now stand on the button.

6199
04:40:39,130 --> 04:40:40,010
I did it.

6200
04:40:52,090 --> 04:40:52,770
Oh,

6201
04:41:04,180 --> 04:41:04,660
look, see?

6202
04:41:05,360 --> 04:41:06,260
It turns.

6203
04:41:07,000 --> 04:41:08,840
Maybe we, like, do that.

6204
04:41:12,630 --> 04:41:14,190
Let it turn and then...

6205
04:41:15,050 --> 04:41:15,350
Look.

6206
04:41:19,790 --> 04:41:21,330
Wait, I think I know.

6207
04:41:26,490 --> 04:41:27,390
I think I know.

6208
04:41:28,370 --> 04:41:28,730
Okay.

6209
04:41:36,220 --> 04:41:37,780
And we gotta push this back.

6210
04:41:39,240 --> 04:41:41,620
And then you loop it, don't you?

6211
04:41:44,800 --> 04:41:46,560
You loop that, I wonder.

6212
04:41:55,290 --> 04:41:56,910
What do we do with this?

6213
04:42:05,010 --> 04:42:06,270
What the fuck?

6214
04:42:11,510 --> 04:42:13,450
Yeah, I'm just wondering where loop's at.

6215
04:42:18,160 --> 04:42:19,800
How do we loop that?

6216
04:42:25,240 --> 04:42:26,120
I'll stand.

6217
04:42:29,380 --> 04:42:30,800
We push that...

6218
04:42:30,800 --> 04:42:32,400
No, we can't push that even more.

6219
04:42:32,500 --> 04:42:33,140
That's the thing.

6220
04:42:38,560 --> 04:42:40,600
I'm just wondering if we could get it to the other side.

6221
04:42:44,980 --> 04:42:45,860
Maybe we...

6222
04:42:45,860 --> 04:42:46,640
Put it at the end?

6223
04:42:46,820 --> 04:42:47,580
Put it at the end.

6224
04:42:53,240 --> 04:42:55,940
No, put it at the end and then we push it up.

6225
04:42:57,080 --> 04:42:57,960
No, like, at the...

6226
04:42:57,960 --> 04:42:59,600
Let it roll all the way.

6227
04:43:05,880 --> 04:43:06,260
How come?

6228
04:43:06,300 --> 04:43:08,180
Because, like, why is the knob all the way over there now?

6229
04:43:09,560 --> 04:43:10,200
Press the button.

6230
04:43:17,970 --> 04:43:19,410
Oh, oh, oh!

6231
04:43:21,900 --> 04:43:22,920
Don't do this to me!

6232
04:43:23,000 --> 04:43:24,080
It went all the way, it went all the way.

6233
04:43:24,120 --> 04:43:24,280
Okay.

6234
04:43:27,920 --> 04:43:28,380
Ta-da!

6235
04:43:36,660 --> 04:43:37,700
I did it!

6236
04:43:41,420 --> 04:43:41,820
Yippie!

6237
04:43:42,460 --> 04:43:42,860
Yippie!

6238
04:43:44,520 --> 04:43:46,180
Then, we just gotta push this.

6239
04:43:46,240 --> 04:43:48,180
We gotta push this and then you just keep pushing the button, so...

6240
04:43:50,000 --> 04:43:50,600
Push it.

6241
04:43:54,080 --> 04:43:56,440
Yeah, and then I'll push it.

6242
04:44:02,070 --> 04:44:02,870
And then...

6243
04:44:02,870 --> 04:44:04,850
Oh, you have to be off the button.

6244
04:44:04,910 --> 04:44:05,070
Yeah.

6245
04:44:07,850 --> 04:44:08,790
Okay, keep it there.

6246
04:44:09,090 --> 04:44:10,330
Don't, you don't need to do anything more.

6247
04:44:11,390 --> 04:44:12,390
I did it!

6248
04:44:15,030 --> 04:44:15,910
I did it!

6249
04:44:18,270 --> 04:44:19,630
I'm so smart.

6250
04:44:20,330 --> 04:44:24,030
What did you think I meant earlier when I was asking you to push the button?

6251
04:44:27,310 --> 04:44:28,670
I'm so smart.

6252
04:44:32,360 --> 04:44:33,240
Yippie!

6253
04:44:36,140 --> 04:44:37,820
I did it!

6254
04:44:39,060 --> 04:44:42,020
I figured out the solution, chat.

6255
04:44:42,570 --> 04:44:45,000
It was all me.

6256
04:44:48,030 --> 04:44:50,420
I figured out the solution.

6257
04:44:55,410 --> 04:44:58,510
Oh, oh, are you okay over there?

6258
04:45:02,860 --> 04:45:04,320
Where's the thing?

6259
04:45:04,440 --> 04:45:05,340
Oh, it's over here.

6260
04:45:09,920 --> 04:45:12,340
Okay, where do I go?

6261
04:45:13,940 --> 04:45:14,340
Oh.

6262
04:45:15,510 --> 04:45:15,980
Oh.

6263
04:45:16,980 --> 04:45:17,680
Here?

6264
04:45:19,380 --> 04:45:20,900
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

6265
04:45:22,200 --> 04:45:22,960
Here we go.

6266
04:45:27,470 --> 04:45:31,090
I go here and then I go here.

6267
04:45:35,040 --> 04:45:37,820
And then we put, push this here.

6268
04:45:39,060 --> 04:45:40,260
Hold on, I need you on the other side.

6269
04:45:40,360 --> 04:45:41,400
I need you on, oh, okay.

6270
04:45:42,240 --> 04:45:43,180
You need to push that.

6271
04:45:43,840 --> 04:45:45,700
And then I push this.

6272
04:45:47,800 --> 04:45:49,820
Yeah, we did it!

6273
04:45:49,840 --> 04:45:51,640
And then we gotta go downstairs, I think.

6274
04:45:53,460 --> 04:45:53,820
Yeah.

6275
04:45:57,300 --> 04:45:58,160
Don't get crushed.

6276
04:45:59,040 --> 04:45:59,960
Don't get crushed.

6277
04:46:04,080 --> 04:46:05,120
And what, here?

6278
04:46:05,380 --> 04:46:07,000
And you go on the other side, you push the other.

6279
04:46:07,180 --> 04:46:08,180
There's a lever on the other.

6280
04:46:10,320 --> 04:46:12,100
Is there not a lever on the other side?

6281
04:46:12,220 --> 04:46:13,120
Oh, there, never mind.

6282
04:46:14,020 --> 04:46:14,300
Yay!

6283
04:46:15,080 --> 04:46:16,020
Yay, yay, yay!

6284
04:46:17,360 --> 04:46:17,720
Yay!

6285
04:46:23,120 --> 04:46:23,480
Yay!

6286
04:46:28,360 --> 04:46:28,840
Yay!

6287
04:46:29,760 --> 04:46:29,980
Yay!

6288
04:46:33,400 --> 04:46:34,900
Get back up here.

6289
04:46:35,120 --> 04:46:38,060
Wall jump right side, wall jump right side.

6290
04:46:38,840 --> 04:46:41,360
Here, I'm going to stand on it, you wall jump right side.

6291
04:46:45,200 --> 04:46:45,460
Yay!

6292
04:46:47,060 --> 04:46:47,540
Yay!

6293
04:46:48,880 --> 04:46:50,700
Okay, we have to wait up there.

6294
04:46:57,780 --> 04:46:58,740
Got you.

6295
04:47:01,660 --> 04:47:04,400
All right, and then...

6296
04:47:04,400 --> 04:47:04,540
Yay!

6297
04:47:05,200 --> 04:47:05,400
Yay!

6298
04:47:06,680 --> 04:47:07,740
We need to push it.

6299
04:47:08,040 --> 04:47:08,620
Oh, and less.

6300
04:47:08,800 --> 04:47:09,500
Oh, shit!

6301
04:47:09,740 --> 04:47:09,980
Koby!

6302
04:47:11,300 --> 04:47:13,840
I don't think that's what Koby means!

6303
04:47:15,960 --> 04:47:17,320
I hit the shot.

6304
04:47:24,660 --> 04:47:25,260
Wait.

6305
04:47:29,190 --> 04:47:29,790
Wait.

6306
04:47:31,130 --> 04:47:31,730
Wait.

6307
04:47:33,910 --> 04:47:34,910
Wait a minute.

6308
04:47:36,650 --> 04:47:37,990
Try jumping on now.

6309
04:47:38,750 --> 04:47:39,290
Go.

6310
04:47:40,630 --> 04:47:41,330
Well, let go.

6311
04:47:41,430 --> 04:47:42,070
Let go first?

6312
04:47:42,170 --> 04:47:42,410
No.

6313
04:47:45,250 --> 04:47:46,830
Wait, why didn't you let go?

6314
04:47:47,450 --> 04:47:49,250
I did, and then you ran back!

6315
04:48:00,250 --> 04:48:01,150
Didn't work.

6316
04:48:09,720 --> 04:48:12,040
I think it was supposed to be on that side.

6317
04:48:12,940 --> 04:48:16,000
I think...

6318
04:48:16,840 --> 04:48:18,760
I think it was this...

6319
04:48:19,860 --> 04:48:20,500
This side.

6320
04:48:24,380 --> 04:48:24,700
Yay!

6321
04:48:27,620 --> 04:48:28,660
No, you have to come to me.

6322
04:48:28,720 --> 04:48:29,340
Come to me, come to me.

6323
04:48:30,200 --> 04:48:31,340
Yeah, no, you have to raise...

6324
04:48:31,340 --> 04:48:32,800
No, no, no, no, no, you didn't raise...

6325
04:48:32,800 --> 04:48:33,400
You didn't raise it enough.

6326
04:48:34,440 --> 04:48:34,880
No, you...

6327
04:48:34,880 --> 04:48:35,260
Stay right here.

6328
04:48:37,560 --> 04:48:37,880
Yippee!

6329
04:48:39,300 --> 04:48:41,760
Because then my rope's going that way.

6330
04:48:41,920 --> 04:48:42,380
Oh, yeah.

6331
04:48:43,700 --> 04:48:44,540
I'm so smart.

6332
04:48:45,380 --> 04:48:45,700
Oh.

6333
04:48:49,740 --> 04:48:50,220
Yay!

6334
04:48:55,700 --> 04:48:56,480
Wait, maybe?

6335
04:48:58,440 --> 04:48:59,300
There we go.

6336
04:49:01,660 --> 04:49:02,620
We did it!

6337
04:49:06,030 --> 04:49:07,190
Dude, what is...

6338
04:49:07,190 --> 04:49:08,890
What are these kids doing, bro?

6339
04:49:09,390 --> 04:49:10,770
No, we should arrest these children.

6340
04:49:11,010 --> 04:49:11,490
This is not...

6341
04:49:11,490 --> 04:49:13,210
We're releasing the floodgates?

6342
04:49:14,210 --> 04:49:15,630
Save the forest!

6343
04:49:16,090 --> 04:49:17,110
We're saved!

6344
04:49:17,130 --> 04:49:18,390
The forest is already break down!

6345
04:49:18,470 --> 04:49:19,210
We're already flooding it!

6346
04:49:19,210 --> 04:49:20,710
This is not good.

6347
04:49:20,790 --> 04:49:22,450
We're actually gonna flood a village.

6348
04:49:22,630 --> 04:49:26,130
We're gonna destroy a village!

6349
04:49:26,550 --> 04:49:27,750
Oh my god!

6350
04:49:28,030 --> 04:49:29,850
We're destroying the ecosystem!

6351
04:49:32,350 --> 04:49:32,670
Oh.

6352
04:49:33,510 --> 04:49:35,110
I guess I'll just stop existing.

6353
04:49:35,550 --> 04:49:35,970
All right.

6354
04:49:36,070 --> 04:49:37,050
I drowned.

6355
04:49:37,690 --> 04:49:40,070
These kids are terraforming.

6356
04:49:41,110 --> 04:49:41,650
Oh!

6357
04:49:44,910 --> 04:49:46,130
Wait, we have double jump!

6358
04:49:46,170 --> 04:49:46,790
We have double jump!

6359
04:49:48,550 --> 04:49:51,810
You know, you could've told me we had double jump before letting me drown, you know?

6360
04:49:54,290 --> 04:49:56,110
You knew we had double jump.

6361
04:49:56,330 --> 04:49:57,730
Somebody let me drown.

6362
04:50:00,550 --> 04:50:01,330
It's all right.

6363
04:50:01,470 --> 04:50:03,450
They have a license to terraform, clearly.

6364
04:50:05,530 --> 04:50:07,230
Oh, the music is really good though.

6365
04:50:08,810 --> 04:50:10,650
No, no, no, no, no.

6366
04:50:10,950 --> 04:50:13,070
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

6367
04:50:14,570 --> 04:50:14,990
Um...

6368
04:50:15,830 --> 04:50:16,250
Um...

6369
04:50:18,650 --> 04:50:19,170
Um...

6370
04:50:19,170 --> 04:50:19,750
It's fine.

6371
04:50:21,870 --> 04:50:23,630
Did you not read the note?

6372
04:50:24,430 --> 04:50:25,990
No, what did it say?

6373
04:50:26,650 --> 04:50:27,130
It said...

6374
04:50:27,730 --> 04:50:29,450
You double jump recharges off walls.

6375
04:50:29,530 --> 04:50:29,850
Oh, look!

6376
04:50:30,890 --> 04:50:31,210
Oh!

6377
04:50:31,950 --> 04:50:33,570
How the fuck did they not drown?

6378
04:50:33,950 --> 04:50:34,510
I don't know.

6379
04:50:34,570 --> 04:50:36,130
They're fucking stupid as hell.

6380
04:50:36,630 --> 04:50:38,170
You double jump to what?

6381
04:50:39,610 --> 04:50:43,550
If you wall jump, you can double jump recharge off of it.

6382
04:50:43,950 --> 04:50:44,270
Oh!

6383
04:50:45,390 --> 04:50:46,490
You know, I don't read.

6384
04:50:49,170 --> 04:50:49,850
Oh!

6385
04:50:52,050 --> 04:50:53,330
All right, here you go.

6386
04:50:53,390 --> 04:50:54,250
Here's the recharge.

6387
04:50:58,910 --> 04:51:00,190
Here we go.

6388
04:51:04,890 --> 04:51:05,950
You're welcome.

6389
04:51:09,190 --> 04:51:10,830
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

6390
04:51:13,330 --> 04:51:15,270
We need the momentum!

6391
04:51:15,610 --> 04:51:16,230
Come on!

6392
04:51:16,410 --> 04:51:17,150
Keep up!

6393
04:51:18,410 --> 04:51:19,550
I can't see.

6394
04:51:19,630 --> 04:51:21,010
Oh my god!

6395
04:51:21,010 --> 04:51:22,990
Get in, get in, get in!

6396
04:51:23,350 --> 04:51:24,010
Get in!

6397
04:51:24,030 --> 04:51:24,810
Perfect timing!

6398
04:51:25,010 --> 04:51:25,670
I got a message!

6399
04:51:26,370 --> 04:51:27,370
Get in!

6400
04:51:28,970 --> 04:51:29,870
We got a message.

6401
04:51:29,970 --> 04:51:30,810
Are you fucking...

6402
04:51:30,810 --> 04:51:31,410
Who are you texting?

6403
04:51:32,350 --> 04:51:34,690
I don't know.

6404
04:51:34,750 --> 04:51:35,950
Maybe my 6 p.m.

6405
04:51:40,330 --> 04:51:41,890
I believe it.

6406
04:51:43,150 --> 04:51:43,990
We die.

6407
04:51:48,520 --> 04:51:49,940
Oh my god, wait.

6408
04:51:50,180 --> 04:51:51,720
Why is there fire here?

6409
04:51:54,620 --> 04:51:55,140
Okay.

6410
04:51:55,260 --> 04:51:56,620
It's a leftover ashes.

6411
04:51:58,580 --> 04:52:00,400
That's what the flood was for!

6412
04:52:00,740 --> 04:52:01,660
Oh my god.

6413
04:52:04,340 --> 04:52:09,340
Jeez, what's the point of flooding the whole entire village if...

6414
04:52:09,340 --> 04:52:11,420
If there's still gonna be fire?

6415
04:52:13,140 --> 04:52:13,700
I don't know.

6416
04:52:13,780 --> 04:52:14,700
These kids are fucking evil.

6417
04:52:15,060 --> 04:52:15,980
Yeah, I know, right?

6418
04:52:16,400 --> 04:52:19,220
It's like they're gonna ruin an entire village and...

6419
04:52:19,220 --> 04:52:20,920
And it doesn't even matter anyway.

6420
04:52:21,920 --> 04:52:22,440
Like...

6421
04:52:23,760 --> 04:52:25,200
All of this was for nothing?

6422
04:52:25,680 --> 04:52:26,460
Wait, how the fuck do I...

6423
04:52:27,200 --> 04:52:28,100
Can I just jump over that?

6424
04:52:28,200 --> 04:52:28,620
Oh yeah, I do.

6425
04:52:28,760 --> 04:52:29,360
I didn't see that.

6426
04:52:33,180 --> 04:52:34,140
It's fine, we're fine.

6427
04:52:35,320 --> 04:52:36,700
Alright, now you're on your own.

6428
04:52:40,500 --> 04:52:41,740
Now it's just water.

6429
04:52:45,460 --> 04:52:45,780
Nope.

6430
04:52:47,580 --> 04:52:47,900
Nope.

6431
04:52:48,400 --> 04:52:48,700
Nope.

6432
04:52:49,000 --> 04:52:49,640
You were too slow.

6433
04:52:49,860 --> 04:52:51,120
If you were faster...

6434
04:52:51,120 --> 04:52:52,960
If you were faster, you might have got the shiny.

6435
04:52:53,180 --> 04:52:53,880
You were too slow.

6436
04:52:54,000 --> 04:52:54,720
Oh wait, what?

6437
04:52:55,580 --> 04:52:56,400
Okay, just relax.

6438
04:52:57,380 --> 04:52:59,120
Oh, let's look into the construction site.

6439
04:52:59,320 --> 04:52:59,520
Oh!

6440
04:52:59,640 --> 04:53:00,200
Oh, what?

6441
04:53:00,280 --> 04:53:01,640
Oh my

6442
04:53:05,310 --> 04:53:07,710
god!

6443
04:53:08,070 --> 04:53:10,310
Now the children are murderers?!

6444
04:53:13,110 --> 04:53:14,070
Holy shit!

6445
04:53:14,490 --> 04:53:16,910
What is this fucking story?

6446
04:53:18,730 --> 04:53:20,830
Holy shit, there's literally...

6447
04:53:20,830 --> 04:53:21,510
I can't...

6448
04:53:21,510 --> 04:53:24,450
There's literally like fire in the water!

6449
04:53:25,930 --> 04:53:27,150
There's like lava!

6450
04:53:27,410 --> 04:53:28,550
There's like fire!

6451
04:53:30,170 --> 04:53:31,890
That was so...

6452
04:53:31,890 --> 04:53:33,090
That was out of nowhere!

6453
04:53:34,750 --> 04:53:37,690
To be fair, the children already committed so much...

6454
04:53:37,690 --> 04:53:38,710
So many crimes.

6455
04:53:38,850 --> 04:53:40,250
Like, this is just one more crime.

6456
04:53:40,610 --> 04:53:42,710
And they're underage, so they're just going to juvie.

6457
04:53:43,390 --> 04:53:46,030
They're not going to actual jail.

6458
04:53:46,410 --> 04:53:48,970
So like, they commit as many crimes as they want.

6459
04:53:48,970 --> 04:53:49,250
What?

6460
04:53:53,590 --> 04:53:54,110
No...

6461
04:53:54,110 --> 04:53:55,330
No, that's on you.

6462
04:53:55,430 --> 04:53:56,590
I didn't even stop you there.

6463
04:53:56,910 --> 04:53:57,090
Right?

6464
04:54:00,070 --> 04:54:02,270
Where did the adults go?

6465
04:54:02,610 --> 04:54:04,210
Children, where did they go?

6466
04:54:04,490 --> 04:54:05,370
They're taking a boat now?

6467
04:54:05,490 --> 04:54:06,150
Like, how did...

6468
04:54:06,770 --> 04:54:07,570
Oh my god!

6469
04:54:07,630 --> 04:54:08,510
What is that?

6470
04:54:09,530 --> 04:54:10,530
Who's that guy?

6471
04:54:12,270 --> 04:54:13,750
Did they just kill another man?

6472
04:54:13,930 --> 04:54:15,290
Did they push another man?

6473
04:54:16,010 --> 04:54:18,350
Did they just push another guy into the water?

6474
04:54:21,110 --> 04:54:21,770
That's...

6475
04:54:23,590 --> 04:54:25,730
I don't understand kids anymore.

6476
04:54:26,290 --> 04:54:26,710
I...

6477
04:54:26,710 --> 04:54:28,770
They're going off the grid.

6478
04:54:29,030 --> 04:54:31,170
They know what crime they committed.

6479
04:54:31,730 --> 04:54:32,430
They gotta go...

6480
04:54:32,430 --> 04:54:32,950
What are you doing?

6481
04:54:33,170 --> 04:54:33,970
It's right here.

6482
04:54:42,780 --> 04:54:44,600
How do we do this?

6483
04:54:46,800 --> 04:54:48,120
Oh, okay.

6484
04:54:48,400 --> 04:54:49,300
That's how.

6485
04:54:53,910 --> 04:54:55,610
It's fucking where I see you.

6486
04:54:55,710 --> 04:54:56,790
Trying to mooch off.

6487
04:54:57,250 --> 04:54:58,890
Oh my god.

6488
04:54:58,970 --> 04:55:00,090
Oh my god.

6489
04:55:00,170 --> 04:55:00,370
Gumi.

6490
04:55:00,830 --> 04:55:01,950
Gumi, what's going on?

6491
04:55:03,810 --> 04:55:04,190
Gumi.

6492
04:55:05,690 --> 04:55:06,370
Gumi.

6493
04:55:07,450 --> 04:55:08,130
Gumi.

6494
04:55:11,730 --> 04:55:12,630
I like...

6495
04:55:12,630 --> 04:55:14,670
I started forgetting the controls at some point.

6496
04:55:15,830 --> 04:55:16,510
Gumi,

6497
04:55:22,510 --> 04:55:22,810
please.

6498
04:55:22,810 --> 04:55:23,030
Please!

6499
04:55:25,950 --> 04:55:27,710
She'll let me stay on.

6500
04:55:31,110 --> 04:55:32,030
Oh, man.

6501
04:55:32,150 --> 04:55:32,490
Wow.

6502
04:55:32,710 --> 04:55:33,230
Okay, Mao.

6503
04:55:33,290 --> 04:55:34,630
Now it's my turn.

6504
04:55:40,080 --> 04:55:41,180
Oh, yep.

6505
04:55:41,260 --> 04:55:41,720
All right.

6506
04:55:43,420 --> 04:55:44,960
Untangle yourself now.

6507
04:55:48,280 --> 04:55:49,980
All right, let's go.

6508
04:55:54,620 --> 04:55:55,220
Nice.

6509
04:55:59,430 --> 04:56:00,370
Oh my god.

6510
04:56:00,430 --> 04:56:01,550
We're like fucking salmon.

6511
04:56:04,510 --> 04:56:08,910
Gotta go to the top of the lake so we can make babies.

6512
04:56:09,310 --> 04:56:09,570
Let's go.

6513
04:56:11,690 --> 04:56:13,090
That's the reason why.

6514
04:56:14,010 --> 04:56:15,550
That's the only thing that's going in their head.

6515
04:56:15,750 --> 04:56:18,550
Yeah, gotta go up this lake so I can...

6516
04:56:18,550 --> 04:56:20,490
So I can pee on some eggs.

6517
04:56:20,510 --> 04:56:21,250
Let's go!

6518
04:56:30,780 --> 04:56:31,700
All right, let's go.

6519
04:56:32,180 --> 04:56:34,000
That's how babies are born, chat.

6520
04:56:37,780 --> 04:56:38,900
The mama...

6521
04:56:38,900 --> 04:56:44,160
Yeah, the mama poops some eggs out and then the papa pee on the eggs and then...

6522
04:56:44,160 --> 04:56:44,340
Wait, wait, wait.

6523
04:56:44,740 --> 04:56:45,320
What's happening?

6524
04:56:45,460 --> 04:56:45,960
What's happening?

6525
04:56:46,940 --> 04:56:47,220
Oh my god.

6526
04:56:48,120 --> 04:56:49,860
Oh my god, they're alive!

6527
04:56:49,860 --> 04:56:50,820
They're like, oh, he's alive!

6528
04:56:50,940 --> 04:56:52,180
Oh no, they're alive!

6529
04:56:52,320 --> 04:56:52,720
No!

6530
04:56:54,580 --> 04:56:56,260
No, we fucked up!

6531
04:56:56,980 --> 04:56:59,240
We didn't finish the job.

6532
04:57:01,900 --> 04:57:03,700
We didn't finish the job.

6533
04:57:03,820 --> 04:57:04,300
It's over.

6534
04:57:05,360 --> 04:57:06,680
Now they...

6535
04:57:06,680 --> 04:57:08,440
Now there's evidence.

6536
04:57:11,620 --> 04:57:12,940
Should've finished...

6537
04:57:12,940 --> 04:57:14,940
Didn't get rid of the witness, guys.

6538
04:57:15,780 --> 04:57:16,680
Oh no, no.

6539
04:57:24,430 --> 04:57:27,590
They should've finished the job when they had the chance.

6540
04:57:28,770 --> 04:57:30,390
Now, now they're alive.

6541
04:57:31,530 --> 04:57:32,830
Now they're alive.

6542
04:57:34,330 --> 04:57:36,550
I think we gotta go right, right side.

6543
04:57:38,250 --> 04:57:38,930
Wait, what?

6544
04:57:39,330 --> 04:57:39,670
Oh.

6545
04:57:43,760 --> 04:57:45,940
You do your stuff first and then...

6546
04:57:45,940 --> 04:57:47,220
Okay, that's, that's fine.

6547
04:57:47,880 --> 04:57:49,080
That, that's fine.

6548
04:57:49,720 --> 04:57:52,060
I waited for you, but you don't have to wait for me.

6549
04:57:52,180 --> 04:57:53,220
That's, that's okay.

6550
04:58:02,110 --> 04:58:03,090
Wait, is this?

6551
04:58:04,930 --> 04:58:05,410
Okay.

6552
04:58:05,430 --> 04:58:05,830
I drowned.

6553
04:58:06,770 --> 04:58:07,950
My turn.

6554
04:58:08,950 --> 04:58:09,710
My turn.

6555
04:58:11,190 --> 04:58:11,630
My turn.

6556
04:58:12,290 --> 04:58:12,630
Oh.

6557
04:58:14,010 --> 04:58:15,190
Okay, wait, let me die first.

6558
04:58:17,410 --> 04:58:18,230
My turn.

6559
04:58:19,430 --> 04:58:19,850
Yay.

6560
04:58:20,450 --> 04:58:21,170
Yay.

6561
04:58:23,670 --> 04:58:24,110
Yippee.

6562
04:58:26,730 --> 04:58:29,030
Now I'm the special little boy.

6563
04:58:30,190 --> 04:58:30,850
Yay.

6564
04:58:37,910 --> 04:58:38,430
Oh.

6565
04:58:38,530 --> 04:58:39,950
I'm the passenger prince.

6566
04:58:48,280 --> 04:58:48,800
What?

6567
04:58:49,800 --> 04:58:51,020
I think you like gotta swing.

6568
04:58:52,020 --> 04:58:53,520
Maybe you gotta swing up.

6569
04:58:53,680 --> 04:58:55,500
And yeah, you see that tree bark that's yellow?

6570
04:58:55,900 --> 04:58:57,940
That's when you can like climb on it.

6571
04:59:00,060 --> 04:59:01,720
The music just got really loud.

6572
04:59:02,140 --> 04:59:03,040
Yeah, it did.

6573
04:59:06,800 --> 04:59:07,320
Um...

6574
04:59:10,200 --> 04:59:10,720
Yay.

6575
04:59:11,580 --> 04:59:13,180
Where the fuck are we going?

6576
04:59:13,500 --> 04:59:14,580
Do we go left or right?

6577
04:59:14,900 --> 04:59:15,460
We're going home.

6578
04:59:15,720 --> 04:59:16,560
I think we're going right.

6579
04:59:17,980 --> 04:59:18,360
Mom.

6580
04:59:28,750 --> 04:59:29,270
Yippee.

6581
04:59:34,770 --> 04:59:36,710
Oh, are we actually going home?

6582
04:59:37,910 --> 04:59:39,310
Oh shit, it's night time.

6583
04:59:40,690 --> 04:59:41,730
Dude, now what?

6584
04:59:42,010 --> 04:59:42,710
Now what?

6585
04:59:42,890 --> 04:59:43,210
Yeah.

6586
04:59:43,570 --> 04:59:44,770
We committed so much crime.

6587
04:59:44,870 --> 04:59:45,890
What if they catch us?

6588
04:59:46,670 --> 04:59:47,910
Oh, that's her parents.

6589
04:59:48,010 --> 04:59:48,470
They're mad.

6590
04:59:49,150 --> 04:59:51,690
Do you think they know we committed eco-terrorism?

6591
04:59:52,850 --> 04:59:54,030
I don't know, maybe.

6592
04:59:54,710 --> 04:59:55,310
Do you think they know?

6593
04:59:55,390 --> 04:59:56,150
We'll never find out.

6594
04:59:56,910 --> 04:59:58,130
Are we gonna go to Juvie?

6595
04:59:58,830 --> 05:00:00,510
Hey, at least we're gonna go to Juvie together.

6596
05:00:06,130 --> 05:00:07,790
And attempted murder too.

6597
05:00:08,350 --> 05:00:08,750
Whoa!

6598
05:00:12,370 --> 05:00:13,670
When did they get Kingdom Hearts?

6599
05:00:14,890 --> 05:00:15,690
Yeah, what the?

6600
05:00:15,890 --> 05:00:16,730
Why are the heartless here?

6601
05:00:17,410 --> 05:00:18,830
Open your heart to darkness.

6602
05:00:18,830 --> 05:00:19,670
Sora.

6603
05:00:24,430 --> 05:00:26,010
What the fuck?

6604
05:00:27,950 --> 05:00:29,110
Oh, wait.

6605
05:00:29,230 --> 05:00:30,130
Who the fuck are these guys?

6606
05:00:30,690 --> 05:00:31,530
Wait, there's others?

6607
05:00:32,090 --> 05:00:33,570
There's all of us.

6608
05:00:35,890 --> 05:00:36,890
There's others?

6609
05:00:38,310 --> 05:00:40,010
And I settled with you?

6610
05:00:40,490 --> 05:00:40,870
Wait, that's...

6611
05:00:40,870 --> 05:00:42,490
My yellow one has a really cute ear.

6612
05:00:44,970 --> 05:00:46,470
You son of a bitch.

6613
05:00:46,870 --> 05:00:48,030
Let's see what my yellow one is.

6614
05:00:48,030 --> 05:00:49,290
I like the short ears.

6615
05:00:49,290 --> 05:00:51,870
Yeah, yeah, the short ears are cute.

6616
05:00:53,910 --> 05:00:55,150
He ordered me dinner.

6617
05:00:55,590 --> 05:00:56,450
What the fuck?

6618
05:01:00,050 --> 05:01:01,530
Thank god there's others.

6619
05:01:01,850 --> 05:01:02,390
I can't decide on what I want.

6620
05:01:04,090 --> 05:01:06,970
I'm having a hard time deciding what I want now.

6621
05:01:07,710 --> 05:01:07,930
Why not?

6622
05:01:07,990 --> 05:01:08,230
Why?

6623
05:01:08,330 --> 05:01:09,130
Just order...

6624
05:01:09,130 --> 05:01:10,510
Just order Chinese food.

6625
05:01:11,330 --> 05:01:12,290
I don't want Chinese food.

6626
05:01:12,290 --> 05:01:13,690
Oh my god, now we have to read this.

6627
05:01:13,910 --> 05:01:14,410
Love, okay.

6628
05:01:14,610 --> 05:01:16,750
Love forms bonds between us...

6629
05:01:16,750 --> 05:01:18,330
but not to hold us back.

6630
05:01:18,770 --> 05:01:22,890
They're meant to save us if we fall or help us climb higher.

6631
05:01:24,210 --> 05:01:28,430
Yes, things break beyond repair sometimes, but we can always build anew.

6632
05:01:29,930 --> 05:01:34,130
If our fire ever fades, it just takes a single spark to set it off again.

6633
05:01:34,710 --> 05:01:39,210
No matter how dark things get, we can all help light the way.

6634
05:01:39,750 --> 05:01:43,350
We can make this life beautiful for ourselves and for each other.

6635
05:01:44,150 --> 05:01:45,610
And we all deserve to be here.

6636
05:01:45,610 --> 05:01:47,830
Whatever shape or color we come in.

6637
05:01:50,370 --> 05:01:51,910
Hey, thank you for playing Rival 2.

6638
05:01:52,010 --> 05:01:53,270
We hope you enjoyed it.

6639
05:01:58,770 --> 05:02:00,290
We did it, guys!

6640
05:02:02,550 --> 05:02:04,950
I'm pretty sure those children are gonna go to jail.

6641
05:02:05,270 --> 05:02:05,770
There's our duty.

6642
05:02:06,090 --> 05:02:07,630
Yeah, I don't know what the fucking lore was.

6643
05:02:07,890 --> 05:02:08,910
I feel like...

6644
05:02:08,910 --> 05:02:10,750
I mean, like, we hated our parents...

6645
05:02:10,750 --> 05:02:12,350
and then, like, we ran away...

6646
05:02:12,350 --> 05:02:14,010
and somehow we committed...

6647
05:02:15,170 --> 05:02:16,310
Lots of crime.

6648
05:02:20,450 --> 05:02:23,910
We committed a lot of crime.

6649
05:02:26,130 --> 05:02:27,210
Oh, there you are.

6650
05:02:27,350 --> 05:02:27,650
Hey.

6651
05:02:30,050 --> 05:02:32,150
Yeah, I don't know what any of these paintings mean.

6652
05:02:34,410 --> 05:02:35,410
Well, I mean...

6653
05:02:37,230 --> 05:02:39,650
Oh, those are the people that are after us right there.

6654
05:02:40,810 --> 05:02:43,090
Yeah, but what does this painting mean on top?

6655
05:02:43,650 --> 05:02:44,370
We're free.

6656
05:02:44,370 --> 05:02:46,250
Maybe the parents were like, we'll help you.

6657
05:02:46,350 --> 05:02:47,410
We'll chase them away.

6658
05:02:48,290 --> 05:02:49,250
What did the...

6659
05:02:49,250 --> 05:02:51,930
Okay, so this is us helping each other.

6660
05:02:52,030 --> 05:02:53,990
Yeah, during the fire that we caused.

6661
05:02:54,730 --> 05:02:55,110
And then...

6662
05:02:57,570 --> 05:02:58,830
How do we get back down?

6663
05:02:59,390 --> 05:02:59,990
I don't know.

6664
05:03:01,850 --> 05:03:02,330
Here?

6665
05:03:02,630 --> 05:03:03,150
Oh, here.

6666
05:03:04,370 --> 05:03:06,830
And this is where, you know, we were trapped in the fire.

6667
05:03:06,890 --> 05:03:08,090
We started the fire.

6668
05:03:10,570 --> 05:03:11,050
Okay.

6669
05:03:11,870 --> 05:03:15,070
And then down here is when I got kidnapped.

6670
05:03:16,890 --> 05:03:18,050
Yeah, that shit was crazy.

6671
05:03:18,270 --> 05:03:19,830
Yeah, I got kidnapped and you just watched.

6672
05:03:19,910 --> 05:03:20,490
I saw you.

6673
05:03:20,530 --> 05:03:21,770
I saw you fucking watch.

6674
05:03:22,370 --> 05:03:23,470
And then we go down.

6675
05:03:27,920 --> 05:03:30,120
And this is when I was like, let's run away from home.

6676
05:03:30,480 --> 05:03:31,140
Like right here.

6677
05:03:31,220 --> 05:03:33,080
That's where I was like, let's run away from home.

6678
05:03:33,540 --> 05:03:34,480
And then you're like, okay.

6679
05:03:35,240 --> 05:03:36,920
Because you have like no free will.

6680
05:03:37,680 --> 05:03:39,160
You're easily pre-pressured.

6681
05:03:39,780 --> 05:03:42,380
And then we're like, yeah, we're free.

6682
05:03:43,480 --> 05:03:44,200
We're free.

6683
05:03:45,600 --> 05:03:46,320
And then...

6684
05:03:46,320 --> 05:03:48,500
And that's when, you know, we started that whole fire.

6685
05:03:48,620 --> 05:03:49,700
Like got kidnapped and stuff.

6686
05:03:50,460 --> 05:03:53,380
Oh, maybe they wanted to kidnap us so they could like ransom us.

6687
05:03:53,500 --> 05:03:54,380
Like hold us hostage.

6688
05:03:54,680 --> 05:03:55,520
So like...

6689
05:03:55,520 --> 05:03:57,160
And ransom us off to our parents.

6690
05:03:57,860 --> 05:03:59,240
Yeah, that's why the eagle crows.

6691
05:03:59,580 --> 05:04:02,460
So in the end, we're not bad people for attempting to murder them.

6692
05:04:02,500 --> 05:04:03,060
Because they were...

6693
05:04:03,060 --> 05:04:03,860
It was self-defense.

6694
05:04:05,220 --> 05:04:05,640
No, no, no.

6695
05:04:06,000 --> 05:04:07,100
Why are we going back up?

6696
05:04:07,720 --> 05:04:08,140
Then why?

6697
05:04:08,200 --> 05:04:08,620
I don't know.

6698
05:04:08,860 --> 05:04:09,820
We just finished the game.

6699
05:04:09,880 --> 05:04:10,240
What do you mean?

6700
05:04:10,240 --> 05:04:11,640
Go down.

6701
05:04:12,100 --> 05:04:12,540
Why?

6702
05:04:13,460 --> 05:04:14,880
Because we were on the second floor.

6703
05:04:15,000 --> 05:04:16,440
We need to go to the first floor.

6704
05:04:16,600 --> 05:04:17,060
Oh, shit.

6705
05:04:17,140 --> 05:04:17,540
You're right.

6706
05:04:17,840 --> 05:04:18,080
Okay.

6707
05:04:19,580 --> 05:04:21,080
I thought we were on the first floor.

6708
05:04:27,620 --> 05:04:28,740
Where's the first painting?

6709
05:04:29,560 --> 05:04:30,360
Oh, it's over here.

6710
05:04:30,420 --> 05:04:31,060
The first painting.

6711
05:04:35,290 --> 05:04:37,090
I can't even see the first painting.

6712
05:04:37,190 --> 05:04:37,830
Not gonna lie.

6713
05:04:37,930 --> 05:04:38,390
Yeah, I'm not gonna...

6714
05:04:40,610 --> 05:04:42,390
We didn't collect enough sparkles.

6715
05:04:43,930 --> 05:04:45,730
Wait, what was that fucking puzzle?

6716
05:04:46,450 --> 05:04:46,890
Like...

6717
05:04:47,110 --> 05:04:47,690
Oh, yeah.

6718
05:04:48,130 --> 05:04:48,530
Unravel to...

6719
05:04:48,530 --> 05:04:49,450
No, you watch it.

6720
05:04:49,510 --> 05:04:50,280
I'm too lazy to...

6721
05:04:50,830 --> 05:04:52,950
Okay, link me the video and I'll post it in chat.

6722
05:04:56,210 --> 05:04:58,650
Unravel to log puzzle.

6723
05:04:59,190 --> 05:05:00,870
It has to be log puzzle, right?

6724
05:05:03,370 --> 05:05:05,570
Does it even have that puzzle solution?

6725
05:05:07,710 --> 05:05:08,710
Unravel to...

6726
05:05:08,710 --> 05:05:10,190
Was it before or after I peed?

6727
05:05:10,730 --> 05:05:11,470
It was before.

6728
05:05:12,210 --> 05:05:12,750
No, it was after.

6729
05:05:13,190 --> 05:05:14,150
Okay, it was after.

6730
05:05:15,090 --> 05:05:15,830
We'll never know.

6731
05:05:15,830 --> 05:05:16,970
Ashes and ashes.

6732
05:05:17,630 --> 05:05:18,510
We'll never...

6733
05:05:18,510 --> 05:05:19,350
Okay, unravel to...

6734
05:05:19,970 --> 05:05:20,470
I found it.

6735
05:05:20,570 --> 05:05:20,970
I found it.

6736
05:05:21,050 --> 05:05:21,490
No...

6737
05:05:21,490 --> 05:05:22,410
Okay, can you link it?

6738
05:05:23,250 --> 05:05:25,350
Yeah, let me get the timestamp for you.

6739
05:05:25,630 --> 05:05:26,070
All right, guys.

6740
05:05:26,150 --> 05:05:28,390
This is how the puzzle was supposed to be solved.

6741
05:05:29,110 --> 05:05:30,390
Which we didn't solve.

6742
05:05:34,190 --> 05:05:36,150
Copy video at timestamp.

6743
05:05:37,970 --> 05:05:39,930
And then send to Doki.

6744
05:05:42,670 --> 05:05:46,950
All right, this was how you actually solve the puzzle, guys.

6745
05:05:47,430 --> 05:05:48,530
All right, let me watch this, too.

6746
05:05:48,890 --> 05:05:51,850
All right, let's see how it was done.

6747
05:05:52,430 --> 05:05:52,730
Okay.

6748
05:05:53,370 --> 05:05:56,990
All right, so we had to tie that while we got the stump.

6749
05:05:57,390 --> 05:05:58,370
No, they untied it.

6750
05:05:58,990 --> 05:05:59,910
No, they tied it.

6751
05:06:00,170 --> 05:06:01,130
They just untied it.

6752
05:06:01,310 --> 05:06:01,970
I'm watching them.

6753
05:06:02,110 --> 05:06:03,450
If they untied it, it would have a string connected to them.

6754
05:06:03,890 --> 05:06:05,210
No, they literally tied it.

6755
05:06:05,430 --> 05:06:05,590
No.

6756
05:06:06,710 --> 05:06:09,330
And then one pushes it.

6757
05:06:10,130 --> 05:06:11,350
Yeah, they tied it.

6758
05:06:13,910 --> 05:06:15,450
I think you're a bit ahead of me.

6759
05:06:18,780 --> 05:06:20,120
They both tied it.

6760
05:06:21,900 --> 05:06:23,480
Is this person playing by themselves?

6761
05:06:24,240 --> 05:06:25,100
Yeah, they are.

6762
05:06:25,200 --> 05:06:26,020
They don't have friends.

6763
05:06:31,980 --> 05:06:32,860
And then...

6764
05:06:32,860 --> 05:06:34,160
Yeah, we have a timestamp.

6765
05:06:36,960 --> 05:06:38,640
And then, they tied it.

6766
05:06:38,860 --> 05:06:39,960
And then, what did they do?

6767
05:06:42,140 --> 05:06:43,700
And they swing?

6768
05:06:47,290 --> 05:06:51,050
The red tied it, and then the blue tied the other one.

6769
05:06:51,570 --> 05:06:52,810
No, they both tied it.

6770
05:06:53,050 --> 05:06:53,470
And then...

6771
05:06:56,210 --> 05:06:57,390
Isn't this what we did?

6772
05:06:57,530 --> 05:06:59,410
Except it took us two years for it?

6773
05:06:59,810 --> 05:07:01,390
No, we did something different.

6774
05:07:02,670 --> 05:07:03,010
Oh.

6775
05:07:03,670 --> 05:07:04,590
No, we did something...

6776
05:07:04,590 --> 05:07:08,290
I think you got us a walkthrough where they don't even know how to play the game.

6777
05:07:08,310 --> 05:07:09,930
Because they're figuring it out as...

6778
05:07:10,970 --> 05:07:11,930
They're literally...

6779
05:07:11,930 --> 05:07:16,370
They're figuring it out, like, right, like, on the spot.

6780
05:07:17,490 --> 05:07:18,310
Oh, man.

6781
05:07:18,670 --> 05:07:20,610
I just need for one with no talking in it.

6782
05:07:21,130 --> 05:07:22,250
They're literally, like...

6783
05:07:22,250 --> 05:07:24,150
They're so confused.

6784
05:07:24,350 --> 05:07:25,290
They're, like, figuring...

6785
05:07:25,290 --> 05:07:26,650
No, I didn't...

6786
05:07:26,650 --> 05:07:27,790
Wait, they didn't...

6787
05:07:27,790 --> 05:07:29,050
It's just tied down...

6788
05:07:29,050 --> 05:07:31,250
They restarted the game because...

6789
05:07:31,250 --> 05:07:34,670
Hey, I think they did exactly what we did.

6790
05:07:34,850 --> 05:07:35,770
Like, we should get that.

6791
05:07:35,770 --> 05:07:37,030
No, they did not.

6792
05:07:37,290 --> 05:07:39,070
They didn't do what we did.

6793
05:07:40,050 --> 05:07:40,890
They tied it.

6794
05:07:40,890 --> 05:07:42,550
We didn't tie it like that.

6795
05:07:42,630 --> 05:07:43,570
They did not.

6796
05:07:47,470 --> 05:07:49,070
We did not.

6797
05:07:49,470 --> 05:07:49,870
This...

6798
05:07:49,870 --> 05:07:51,890
This is so different.

6799
05:07:52,510 --> 05:07:53,990
This is so different.

6800
05:07:55,270 --> 05:07:56,890
This is not how you did it.

6801
05:07:57,730 --> 05:07:58,690
I'll be honest.

6802
05:07:58,750 --> 05:07:59,350
I don't remember.

6803
05:07:59,630 --> 05:08:00,570
It's been so long.

6804
05:08:02,330 --> 05:08:03,450
This is not even...

6805
05:08:04,350 --> 05:08:06,190
It's not even a tutorial.

6806
05:08:08,910 --> 05:08:11,310
He was so confused.

6807
05:08:11,830 --> 05:08:14,730
Here, let me look up Unravel to Speed Run.

6808
05:08:16,970 --> 05:08:18,930
Unravel to any percent solo speed run.

6809
05:08:20,410 --> 05:08:21,490
Alright, alright.

6810
05:08:21,590 --> 05:08:22,150
GG's.

6811
05:08:22,270 --> 05:08:23,230
We did it, guys.

6812
05:08:23,550 --> 05:08:24,050
We...

6813
05:08:24,930 --> 05:08:26,950
We beat Unravel 2.

6814
05:08:28,590 --> 05:08:31,950
This guy beat the entire game within one hour.

6815
05:08:32,750 --> 05:08:33,990
Okay, but they're not...

6816
05:08:33,990 --> 05:08:34,650
And 50 minutes.

6817
05:08:34,960 --> 05:08:35,230
I'm...

6818
05:08:37,850 --> 05:08:39,570
Never mind, it took him two hours.

6819
05:08:42,270 --> 05:08:44,170
Look, I don't think we're speed runners.

6820
05:08:44,750 --> 05:08:47,250
I don't think we're speed runners.

6821
05:08:47,250 --> 05:08:49,730
His fastest time was one hour 56 minutes.

6822
05:08:51,590 --> 05:08:52,970
You know what, Gumi?

6823
05:08:53,850 --> 05:08:56,150
I'm glad we fixed our marriage again.

6824
05:08:57,330 --> 05:09:01,890
Yeah, I think at some point that puzzle put a sense of clarity in my mind.

6825
05:09:01,890 --> 05:09:05,610
Yeah, like that puzzle literally opened your third eye, right?

6826
05:09:07,270 --> 05:09:09,030
Apparently, we brute-forced it.

6827
05:09:09,510 --> 05:09:10,110
I...

6828
05:09:13,110 --> 05:09:15,670
Yeah, we're gonna have to watch that back.

6829
05:09:15,730 --> 05:09:16,330
We're gonna have to watch it.

6830
05:09:21,790 --> 05:09:24,030
But we did it, guys.

6831
05:09:25,410 --> 05:09:27,710
We did it, everybody.

6832
05:09:30,690 --> 05:09:31,290
GG's.

6833
05:09:33,010 --> 05:09:33,410
GG's.

6834
05:09:33,770 --> 05:09:34,590
What a...

6835
05:09:34,590 --> 05:09:35,510
What a journey.

6836
05:09:35,730 --> 05:09:37,450
Also, I can't do the thing tomorrow, because...

6837
05:09:38,010 --> 05:09:40,090
My schedule is literally out in public.

6838
05:09:40,210 --> 05:09:40,850
I literally have a...

6839
05:09:40,850 --> 05:09:41,670
Okay, no.

6840
05:09:41,770 --> 05:09:44,890
The thing is, I asked you last week and you were like, I'll get back to you later tonight.

6841
05:09:44,990 --> 05:09:46,850
And then I was like, okay, and you never did.

6842
05:09:47,030 --> 05:09:47,650
Yeah, but that's...

6843
05:09:47,650 --> 05:09:49,450
It was your job to remind me.

6844
05:09:52,950 --> 05:09:55,630
It was your job to remind me, you know?

6845
05:09:55,650 --> 05:09:57,450
To be like, oh yeah, remember that thing?

6846
05:09:57,870 --> 05:09:58,470
You don't want...

6847
05:10:02,590 --> 05:10:05,370
It was your job to remind me, you know?

6848
05:10:05,530 --> 05:10:09,810
To be like, oh yeah, remember that thing that you wanted to do?

6849
05:10:10,050 --> 05:10:10,570
Like, you know?

6850
05:10:14,530 --> 05:10:18,870
Anyway, I'm glad we beat a game in our game together, Gumi.

6851
05:10:20,350 --> 05:10:22,470
I didn't eat lunch yet, by the way.

6852
05:10:22,710 --> 05:10:23,190
I...

6853
05:10:28,270 --> 05:10:31,130
All right, so the next one we're gonna play is We Were Here.

6854
05:10:32,290 --> 05:10:32,710
All right.

6855
05:10:32,950 --> 05:10:33,750
All right, let's...

6856
05:10:34,550 --> 05:10:35,610
Whoa, okay.

6857
05:10:35,770 --> 05:10:36,550
Wait, wait, wait.

6858
05:10:36,570 --> 05:10:37,110
Wait a minute.

6859
05:10:37,330 --> 05:10:37,950
Wait a minute.

6860
05:10:38,370 --> 05:10:39,310
Wait a minute.

6861
05:10:40,070 --> 05:10:40,970
Wait a minute.

6862
05:10:41,970 --> 05:10:42,890
Wait, what's We Were Here?

6863
05:10:45,190 --> 05:10:46,550
It's a different one.

6864
05:10:46,770 --> 05:10:47,230
We...

6865
05:10:47,230 --> 05:10:48,410
Oh no, I played this game before.

6866
05:10:49,190 --> 05:10:49,690
You have?

6867
05:10:49,850 --> 05:10:50,790
Yeah, I played it before.

6868
05:10:53,290 --> 05:10:54,210
It was...

6869
05:10:54,930 --> 05:11:03,590
In my opinion, if we were struggling on these puzzles, we would struggle in any game from the series.

6870
05:11:05,810 --> 05:11:08,070
All right, let's play the cowboy one then.

6871
05:11:08,510 --> 05:11:09,990
What the fuck is the cowboy one?

6872
05:11:10,050 --> 05:11:11,470
You keep saying cowboy one.

6873
05:11:11,610 --> 05:11:13,190
I don't know what you're talking about.

6874
05:11:13,410 --> 05:11:14,210
The cowboy one.

6875
05:11:14,410 --> 05:11:15,410
What the fuck is cowboy?

6876
05:11:19,960 --> 05:11:20,440
Um...

6877
05:11:20,440 --> 05:11:22,640
The princess of it takes two.

6878
05:11:24,320 --> 05:11:24,800
What?

6879
05:11:25,000 --> 05:11:26,400
They made another game, didn't they?

6880
05:11:28,900 --> 05:11:29,740
I don't know.

6881
05:11:30,300 --> 05:11:32,460
I don't know what the cowboy one is.

6882
05:11:32,920 --> 05:11:33,600
A Way Out.

6883
05:11:34,300 --> 05:11:35,020
That's not cowboy.

6884
05:11:35,020 --> 05:11:35,700
Are they cowboys?

6885
05:11:36,120 --> 05:11:36,300
No.

6886
05:11:37,240 --> 05:11:38,280
That's not...

6887
05:11:38,280 --> 05:11:38,720
No.

6888
05:11:43,040 --> 05:11:43,880
It's...

6889
05:11:43,880 --> 05:11:44,360
They're...

6890
05:11:44,360 --> 05:11:45,000
They're...

6891
05:11:45,000 --> 05:11:46,100
They're American.

6892
05:11:47,860 --> 05:11:48,200
Yeah?

6893
05:11:48,660 --> 05:11:49,220
One...

6894
05:11:49,220 --> 05:11:49,740
One...

6895
05:11:49,740 --> 05:11:50,140
One...

6896
05:11:50,140 --> 05:11:51,200
True, true.

6897
05:11:51,540 --> 05:11:52,120
One like...

6898
05:11:52,120 --> 05:11:54,200
It's like something about prison.

6899
05:11:56,600 --> 05:11:57,440
Something...

6900
05:11:58,060 --> 05:11:59,380
Cowboys can go to prison?

6901
05:12:01,320 --> 05:12:03,260
It's not called prison.

6902
05:12:03,480 --> 05:12:04,080
It's like...

6903
05:12:05,240 --> 05:12:06,120
Something else.

6904
05:12:06,580 --> 05:12:07,620
It's... I forgot what it's called.

6905
05:12:07,800 --> 05:12:08,240
It's uh...

6906
05:12:09,720 --> 05:12:10,160
Uh...

6907
05:12:10,160 --> 05:12:11,120
It's like prison break.

6908
05:12:11,200 --> 05:12:12,940
Yeah, but for cowboys, you don't...

6909
05:12:12,940 --> 05:12:14,240
It's not called prison.

6910
05:12:14,400 --> 05:12:15,360
It's called something else.

6911
05:12:16,180 --> 05:12:16,620
It's...

6912
05:12:16,620 --> 05:12:17,440
Just...

6913
05:12:17,440 --> 05:12:17,880
What is it?

6914
05:12:18,300 --> 05:12:19,140
Not dungeon.

6915
05:12:19,380 --> 05:12:20,100
It's like a jail.

6916
05:12:20,180 --> 05:12:21,720
It's like a jail, but...

6917
05:12:21,720 --> 05:12:22,020
It's not...

6918
05:12:22,600 --> 05:12:24,020
Yeah, they're in the sheriff's jail.

6919
05:12:24,040 --> 05:12:25,060
Yeah, they're in the sheriff's...

6920
05:12:25,060 --> 05:12:25,840
I guess so.

6921
05:12:26,320 --> 05:12:26,840
I guess.

6922
05:12:27,180 --> 05:12:27,500
What is cowboys?

6923
05:12:28,380 --> 05:12:29,460
It's not cowboys!

6924
05:12:29,640 --> 05:12:30,220
It's not...

6925
05:12:30,220 --> 05:12:31,520
It's not a Western!

6926
05:12:32,120 --> 05:12:32,600
It's not...

6927
05:12:34,220 --> 05:12:35,600
It's not a Western!

6928
05:12:35,840 --> 05:12:37,140
It's literally prison break.

6929
05:12:39,500 --> 05:12:40,620
Anyway, all right.

6930
05:12:40,700 --> 05:12:41,100
I'm gonna...

6931
05:12:42,140 --> 05:12:44,500
I'm gonna go grab some food, Gumi.

6932
05:12:44,840 --> 05:12:46,780
And you go have fun at Mario Kart.

6933
05:12:47,720 --> 05:12:49,040
What time is your Mario...

6934
05:12:49,040 --> 05:12:49,760
I don't even know if Kenji's awake, bro.

6935
05:12:49,880 --> 05:12:51,240
What time is your Mario Kart collab?

6936
05:12:51,520 --> 05:12:52,880
It's supposed to be in 10 minutes.

6937
05:12:53,000 --> 05:12:54,740
And I don't even think Kenji's awake.

6938
05:12:55,300 --> 05:12:56,440
Wait, who's in it?

6939
05:12:56,940 --> 05:12:58,000
It's just Kenji and me.

6940
05:12:58,200 --> 05:12:58,760
Oh, oh.

6941
05:12:59,300 --> 05:13:00,160
It's just like...

6942
05:13:00,560 --> 05:13:02,800
And I'm just confused.

6943
05:13:03,000 --> 05:13:04,760
I was like, I thought it's Mario Kart.

6944
05:13:04,900 --> 05:13:05,880
What do you mean it's just you two?

6945
05:13:06,740 --> 05:13:07,720
No, he...

6946
05:13:07,720 --> 05:13:08,820
I like invite him to games.

6947
05:13:08,920 --> 05:13:11,780
He's like, I only want to play Mario Kart.

6948
05:13:12,300 --> 05:13:12,560
Why?

6949
05:13:12,720 --> 05:13:13,320
What's wrong?

6950
05:13:15,300 --> 05:13:16,040
Wait, why?

6951
05:13:16,280 --> 05:13:18,060
Why Mario Kart of all...

6952
05:13:18,060 --> 05:13:19,700
Because he loves Mario Kart.

6953
05:13:20,020 --> 05:13:22,600
Oh my god, that freaking freak.

6954
05:13:23,360 --> 05:13:23,800
What?

6955
05:13:28,620 --> 05:13:29,940
That's like...

6956
05:13:30,140 --> 05:13:32,580
That's fucking masochist behavior.

6957
05:13:32,860 --> 05:13:36,300
And Mario Kart's like the only game you like.

6958
05:13:39,240 --> 05:13:41,600
Let this man enjoy his Mario...

6959
05:13:41,600 --> 05:13:43,520
There's so many games!

6960
05:13:43,980 --> 05:13:45,760
And it's Mario Kart?

6961
05:13:46,820 --> 05:13:49,160
Dude, he just likes Mario Kart, bro.

6962
05:13:50,680 --> 05:13:50,980
Yeah.

6963
05:13:52,600 --> 05:13:53,600
Still a freak.

6964
05:13:56,340 --> 05:13:58,440
All right, all right, Gumi.

6965
05:13:59,020 --> 05:14:00,260
I'll message you.

6966
05:14:00,440 --> 05:14:02,040
We'll see each other probably next month.

6967
05:14:02,620 --> 05:14:03,800
Chi-chis, Gumi.

6968
05:14:04,140 --> 05:14:05,080
Chi-chis.

6969
05:14:05,320 --> 05:14:09,580
We'll have another marriage cat therapy session next month.

6970
05:14:09,680 --> 05:14:11,800
Maybe co-op games aren't it for us.

6971
05:14:12,240 --> 05:14:12,880
Maybe...

6972
05:14:13,560 --> 05:14:15,620
Maybe we shouldn't do co-op ever again.

6973
05:14:20,400 --> 05:14:21,660
Your decision.

6974
05:14:22,680 --> 05:14:24,000
No, hey, do you know what?

6975
05:14:24,080 --> 05:14:25,600
I think we can be cowboys.

6976
05:14:26,660 --> 05:14:27,940
We'll figure it out.

6977
05:14:27,960 --> 05:14:29,260
We'll figure it out.

6978
05:14:30,220 --> 05:14:31,300
All right.

6979
05:14:38,060 --> 05:14:39,580
Oh my god.

6980
05:14:40,400 --> 05:14:41,780
I'm hungry, guys.

6981
05:14:42,240 --> 05:14:43,660
I'm so hungry right now.

6982
05:14:43,780 --> 05:14:48,120
I didn't have time to eat lunch because I went straight into...

6983
05:14:48,720 --> 05:14:50,740
I had to go straight into the...

6984
05:14:50,740 --> 05:14:52,580
I woke up and I was like...

6985
05:14:52,580 --> 05:14:53,860
Okay, gotta walk, dad.

6986
05:14:54,280 --> 05:14:55,620
And then do the...

6987
05:14:55,620 --> 05:14:57,000
And then get ready for the collab.

6988
05:14:57,560 --> 05:14:58,880
And then figure out fucking...

6989
05:14:59,660 --> 05:15:01,600
Fucking figure out RoboPlay.

6990
05:15:04,400 --> 05:15:08,280
But I hope you guys had fun watching today.

6991
05:15:08,960 --> 05:15:09,540
I'm tired.

6992
05:15:09,760 --> 05:15:12,020
I'm really tired now.

6993
05:15:12,360 --> 05:15:13,840
So I'm gonna...

6994
05:15:13,840 --> 05:15:15,180
I'm gonna go...

6995
05:15:15,180 --> 05:15:16,680
I'm gonna go grab some food.

6996
05:15:16,780 --> 05:15:18,120
I hope you guys had a great time watching.

6997
05:15:18,820 --> 05:15:19,620
I still...

6998
05:15:19,620 --> 05:15:20,620
I hope like...

6999
05:15:20,620 --> 05:15:24,020
I hope the stream went okay because I literally don't have a stream preview.

7000
05:15:24,420 --> 05:15:26,500
Like I said, when we're figuring out RoboPlay...

7001
05:15:32,440 --> 05:15:35,120
My OBS like fucking destroyed itself.

7002
05:15:35,400 --> 05:15:37,400
So I literally had no stream preview.

7003
05:15:37,500 --> 05:15:38,860
So I didn't know what was going on.

7004
05:15:38,900 --> 05:15:41,840
Or like if you guys can even see the game properly or anything.

7005
05:15:44,780 --> 05:15:47,500
I hope you guys had a great time.

7006
05:15:47,500 --> 05:15:51,040
And I hope I didn't give you guys any trauma or PTSD.

7007
05:15:53,340 --> 05:15:56,220
Or if it felt too real.

7008
05:15:57,100 --> 05:15:58,020
Anyway, guys.

7009
05:15:58,400 --> 05:16:00,180
As always, everybody, say hi.

7010
05:16:01,620 --> 05:16:04,000
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

7011
05:16:04,400 --> 05:16:07,720
And if you stay up for me, head to bed because you deserve it.

7012
05:16:07,820 --> 05:16:09,520
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

7013
05:16:10,500 --> 05:16:11,380
Bye, guys.

7014
05:16:11,380 --> 05:16:12,040
Mmm.

7015
05:16:12,700 --> 05:16:13,000
Bye.
