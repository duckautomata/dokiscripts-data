1
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,320
Hello, everybody!

2
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,920
Hello, hello!

3
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,480
Oh my gosh, I need a little bit right now.

4
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,920
I need a little bit to like, rev up my system at the moment.

5
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:56,180
My eyes... I just feel like a little bit fatigued today.

6
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,220
So I just need like a little...

7
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,980
It usually takes me a while to get back into the groove of things.

8
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,260
I just need a little bit...

9
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,840
Need a little bit of time to just be like...

10
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,960
Like a little car engine right now.

11
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,600
We looped because I have to wash my cup.

12
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,680
Because I need a tea today.

13
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,100
Just a little bit of caffeine today.

14
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,600
But I am okay.

15
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,800
I am okay.

16
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,340
Update.

17
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,960
My team won Twitch Rivals.

18
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,280
We beat Shroud and xQc.

19
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,280
That's... I don't really want to say more.

20
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,780
I don't really want to say more because I'm done with drama.

21
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,300
I'm just...

22
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,700
I'm happy we won.

23
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,300
I'm very happy.

24
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,580
I...

25
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,100
Like legitimately, I can't believe like...

26
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,920
I got out...

27
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,300
Like I stayed...

28
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,360
Like, you know, I ventured out of the YouTube bubble.

29
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,660
For...

30
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,020
For two weeks.

31
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,620
And then got into this whole situation.

32
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,320
But in the end, it doesn't matter.

33
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,480
Because my team ended up winning.

34
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,680
We won the...

35
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,100
We won Twitch Rivals.

36
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,380
Cody's planning on releasing a video.

37
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,400
So check that out.

38
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,440
I saw the script.

39
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,260
He sent me the script.

40
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,180
And was like, can I say this?

41
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,080
Are you comfortable with me saying this?

42
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,800
And I was like...

43
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,340
Yeah, you know I'm a neighborly.

44
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,780
So fucking yeah, let's do it.

45
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:28,540
Like...

46
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,840
I was like...

47
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,480
Yeah, keep that shit in.

48
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:32,520
Do it.

49
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,000
Keep that shit in.

50
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,260
I don't care.

51
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,860
So when you watch the video...

52
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,870
It's gonna be fucking spicy.

53
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,880
That's for sure.

54
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,580
It's gonna be...

55
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:44,900
Okay.

56
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,080
I'll say something.

57
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,720
I think it's...

58
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,040
Okay.

59
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,680
Cody...

60
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,540
He's also an enabler.

61
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,480
And I fucking love Cody.

62
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,660
He's so...

63
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,500
Oh my god.

64
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,860
He does not care.

65
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,640
He's also an enabler.

66
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,060
And he would like...

67
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,460
He's willing to argue with anybody.

68
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,660
Even children.

69
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:06,580
So...

70
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,280
So...

71
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:08,580
So...

72
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,120
You know...

73
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,560
There were some people that were not happy about our team winning.

74
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,760
And then they kept like spamming on Twitter.

75
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,400
On all of us.

76
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,320
And so like...

77
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,480
Cody...

78
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,800
I messaged Cody.

79
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,200
And he was like...

80
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,120
He was like...

81
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,520
Oh yeah.

82
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,880
That shit was so fun.

83
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,320
I had an hour to kill while my kid was at gym...

84
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,760
While my kid was at gymnastic practice.

85
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,880
And it fucking feels me.

86
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,500
And I was like...

87
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,760
I was like...

88
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,800
I was like...

89
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,620
My man.

90
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,280
And he was like...

91
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:43,360
Yeah.

92
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,740
I just had an hour to kill.

93
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,540
And I figured...

94
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,120
Might as well.

95
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,600
Nothing else to do right now.

96
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,400
And then...

97
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,520
So like...

98
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,800
At one point...

99
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,480
A weather bot was...

100
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:53,860
Like...

101
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,420
It was...

102
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:54,780
Okay.

103
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,460
I thought it was so fucking funny.

104
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,740
But like...

105
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,480
There is one account that he was arguing with.

106
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,600
That was a gimmick account.

107
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,600
It was a weather bot...

108
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:06,780
Slash...

109
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,360
XQC fan account.

110
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,440
I was like...

111
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,180
What a crazy combination.

112
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:12,700
And then...

113
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,600
Cody was like...

114
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,540
Oh my god.

115
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,280
I'm arguing with a weather bot.

116
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,130
It was so funny.

117
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,370
Because I was like...

118
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,330
What the fuck?

119
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,630
How are you like...

120
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,910
What a combo.

121
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,270
So...

122
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,370
So yeah.

123
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:36,990
It was...

124
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,390
Such a fucking Twitter moment right there.

125
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:42,790
I don't know how people can thrive off of...

126
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:43,010
Like...

127
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,250
I understand like...

128
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,950
That's how you can build up momentum.

129
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,170
And like how you can...

130
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,670
How you can like...

131
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,270
Create like...

132
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:53,990
Like how...

133
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,630
What's the word?

134
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,730
How you put yourself on people's feed.

135
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:59,890
Because it makes people remember you and stuff like that.

136
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,150
Because it's like...

137
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:01,470
You know...

138
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,030
Doing drama and like...

139
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,790
Being involved and shit like that.

140
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,070
It raises engagement.

141
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,510
It puts you on...

142
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,950
It makes people be aware of you.

143
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:09,790
Visibility.

144
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:10,650
All of that.

145
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:11,590
Stay in the dialogue.

146
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,070
It makes you relevant.

147
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:14,990
But that shit is so tired.

148
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:15,750
I don't understand.

149
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:16,570
Like I...

150
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:17,950
I was like...

151
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,030
I was like...

152
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,550
I don't understand how people can do this.

153
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:22,050
It's like...

154
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,430
Like I'm just like...

155
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:23,710
I...

156
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,750
I was so tired.

157
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,410
Like I was so...

158
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,090
I wasn't even like involved anymore.

159
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,590
But I was so tired.

160
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:36,350
But...

161
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,050
I gained 3k followers on Twitter.

162
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,110
Which was crazy.

163
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:40,730
Because I was like...

164
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,010
I didn't do anything.

165
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,850
I literally just...

166
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,270
I made two tweets.

167
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,210
Just to clarify.

168
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,610
That I wasn't gonna be there.

169
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,310
And like explaining to my fans.

170
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,170
Why I won't be there.

171
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,230
And then I gained 3k Twitter followers.

172
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:55,350
From...

173
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:58,090
I don't even know how many like Twitch followers I gained from that.

174
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:58,890
I gained like...

175
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,150
I'm so surprised.

176
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:00,510
Because like...

177
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,970
I barely exist on Twitter.

178
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:02,670
And...

179
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:06,110
I barely exist on Twitter.

180
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,030
And like...

181
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,230
And like...

182
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,430
And then like people were like...

183
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:10,950
You know what?

184
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,410
I'm a follower after this.

185
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,010
I'm like...

186
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:15,730
Oh my god.

187
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,690
I think like the funniest part though.

188
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,330
During the entire Twitch Rivals tournament.

189
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,190
Is that...

190
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,390
Every time they win a game.

191
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,090
Or before they get into a game.

192
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,190
Or they win anything.

193
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:31,170
My...

194
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,630
Old team...

195
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,170
Would be like...

196
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:34,830
For Doki!

197
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,830
For Doki!

198
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,750
And then people have no idea what the fuck is going on.

199
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,650
Because the team wasn't named Doki anymore.

200
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,570
It was named Hogs.

201
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:44,290
Like after like...

202
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,250
Like my replacement captain.

203
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:47,110
People were like...

204
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,770
Who the fuck is Doki?

205
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,210
I'm like...

206
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,430
Please say Doki Bird.

207
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,190
Please for the love of god.

208
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,730
Someone just say Doki Bird.

209
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:58,210
Because I don't want them to follow that Rainbow Six Siege guy.

210
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,110
That has the name Doki right now.

211
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:00,770
Like...

212
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,250
I was like...

213
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:02,690
Please.

214
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,610
Someone say Doki Bird.

215
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:05,430
Please.

216
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:09,290
Or everything's gonna funnel to that random Rainbow Six Siege pro player.

217
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,090
Who has the name Doki.

218
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:11,910
Please.

219
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:14,830
I...

220
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:18,390
For Doki called Rainbow Six Siege.

221
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:19,350
Nestor.

222
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,510
If you look it up on Twitch.

223
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,330
This guy has...

224
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,950
I could never change my name.

225
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,010
Because like...

226
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:26,670
I always wanted to be Doki.

227
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,450
Like just straight up Doki for Twitch.

228
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:29,570
Because I thought I was so clean.

229
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,670
But like...

230
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:35,550
This guy has claimed the name Doki for like...

231
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,190
Years now.

232
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:37,930
I think like 6 plus years.

233
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,610
Ever since Rainbow Six Siege was a thing.

234
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:41,310
So like...

235
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,470
If anybody's gonna look up Doki on Twitch.

236
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,690
That guy's name is gonna show up.

237
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:46,410
And I'm like...

238
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,870
Someone say Doki Bird.

239
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:48,430
Please.

240
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,270
It's not that.

241
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,150
Someone

242
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,500
say Doki Bird.

243
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:00,100
I don't wanna funnel everybody into this random guy's channel.

244
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,860
No one knew.

245
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,400
Doki Bird is not the...

246
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,360
Is the real not Doki.

247
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,460
We're too late.

248
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,040
For not Doki.

249
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,480
Gets the free advertisement.

250
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:20,960
Basically.

251
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,100
Yeah.

252
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,240
Anyway.

253
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,920
I don't know who we're for anymore.

254
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,200
Darkblade.

255
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,160
Thank you for the super chat.

256
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:31,500
Thank you.

257
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:31,860
Thank you.

258
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,960
How does it feel knowing that Coney is a Mutant and Raccoon lover?

259
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:42,140
I think the most terrible thing is that my team won because they had to put Coney on Rocket Raccoon.

260
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,500
And that was like the game changing strat.

261
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,380
And it really...

262
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,040
It really hurt.

263
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,080
It really did.

264
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:51,740
I...

265
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,120
I got...

266
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,120
I did get a little sad.

267
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,120
That...

268
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:04,200
The reason why we won was because we put Coney on Rocket Raccoon.

269
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,420
And it does...

270
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:11,360
It does make me a little sad after my prejudice against Raccoon.

271
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,020
They won because of a fucking Raccoon.

272
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:20,340
If I was there, this would never have happened.

273
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:25,120
Guys, if I was there, this would have never happened.

274
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,400
My favorite was every time Coney's chat convinced him to go Mr. Fantastic.

275
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,720
His entire chat would just say that again.

276
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,280
Thank you for the super chat.

277
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:38,860
Thank you.

278
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,220
Thank you.

279
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,080
Paladins, thank you for the super chat.

280
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:42,360
Thank you.

281
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:42,840
Thank you.

282
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,700
The team won it for you, Coach Doki.

283
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,560
Thank you for the super chat.

284
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:45,820
Thank you.

285
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,280
Thank you.

286
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,540
GoldenDragon, thank you for the super chat.

287
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:48,880
Thank you.

288
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,620
Thank you.

289
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,920
Congratulations on your team winning Twitch Rivals.

290
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:53,660
Thank you.

291
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,580
Thank you for the super chat.

292
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:54,920
Thank you.

293
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,740
Thank you.

294
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,000
Testidious, thank you for the super chat.

295
00:12:59,060 --> 00:12:59,300
Thank you.

296
00:12:59,340 --> 00:12:59,740
Thank you.

297
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,840
Everyone got what they deserved, including your team's win.

298
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,660
Thank you for the super chat.

299
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:02,960
Thank you.

300
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:03,600
Thank you.

301
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,180
Yeah, it's been a wild couple of days.

302
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,040
I'll talk a little bit more about it, but basically...

303
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,200
I know I said I was not going to talk more, but like...

304
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,540
Fuck it.

305
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,400
I'm already...

306
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,320
I lied.

307
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,100
I lied.

308
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:16,160
Okay.

309
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:17,760
Um...

310
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,000
Um...

311
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,300
Uh...

312
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,740
Basically, uh...

313
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,540
I am...

314
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,920
I'm also like really tired.

315
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,280
I'm still like waiting for the...

316
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,300
The...

317
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,140
The caffeine to kick in right now.

318
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,440
But like, I...

319
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,300
I didn't get...

320
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:37,300
I didn't play in the tournament, but like, I was so scared and nervous.

321
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,280
Like, I legitimately...

322
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,700
I talked about it on the Kony stream when the tournament ended.

323
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:49,900
But like, I was actually so anxious and like so...

324
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:54,060
So nervous that I didn't even do any work yesterday.

325
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,580
I know I was like, I'm not going to watch it.

326
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,920
But like, I watched the quarterfin...

327
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:58,980
The...

328
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,200
I watched the semis and the finals because I was...

329
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,100
You know, they were literally playing Shroud and xQc.

330
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,640
And like, I was so nervous for them.

331
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,460
And like, I didn't care.

332
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,080
My main goal was to...

333
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,360
I wanted them to beat Shroud.

334
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,460
Because I live vicariously through them.

335
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,600
I'm like the dance mom because I couldn't meet my goals.

336
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,740
So I...

337
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,580
I pretended that I was them.

338
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,220
And like...

339
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,580
I lived through their lives.

340
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:29,580
And...

341
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,680
And like...

342
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,520
So like, I legitimately did not care if we lose or win against xQc.

343
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,260
I just really wanted them to beat Shroud.

344
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,460
So...

345
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,480
So I was so scared because I thought it was...

346
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,200
Like, the first two games...

347
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,340
It was very scared.

348
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,420
And then like...

349
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,040
I couldn't watch on the third game.

350
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,660
After the third game, I stopped watching.

351
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,260
Because I was legitimately gonna throw up.

352
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:54,800
I...

353
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:59,360
That was how nervous and anxious I was.

354
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,060
I was...

355
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,560
I legitimately was gonna throw up if I kept watching.

356
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,480
And so like, I...

357
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,380
Like, I messaged Boger.

358
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,580
And I was like, are you watching the games?

359
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,340
And he was like, yeah.

360
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,540
And then I was like...

361
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,200
Oh my god.

362
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,600
Like, can you like, tell me if they win or not?

363
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,600
Because I can't take this.

364
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,540
They're making this way too close for me.

365
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,400
Like, I...

366
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,360
Like, I was like...

367
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,320
I can't.

368
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,520
They legitimately...

369
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,560
They won by like, 1%.

370
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,840
They could've...

371
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,560
It was so scary.

372
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,300
Because Shroud was winning the last...

373
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,440
Very last match.

374
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,540
And then they flipped it.

375
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,920
It was King of the Hill.

376
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,280
And they flipped it at the very last game.

377
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,760
And from 99...

378
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,340
From 0 to 99 to 100 to 99.

379
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,540
It was the 1% flip.

380
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,420
And it...

381
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,400
I...

382
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,260
I like...

383
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,040
Oh my god.

384
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,820
I legitimately...

385
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,380
I was gonna...

386
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,280
I was gonna throw up.

387
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,080
Because like, I watched the last game.

388
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,800
During the last game.

389
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,320
I watched it.

390
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,300
And I was gonna be like...

391
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,900
Alright, I'm either gonna be super fucking depressed.

392
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,960
Or...

393
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,200
I'm gonna...

394
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,520
Okay, it was like...

395
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,040
I'm gonna be...

396
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,140
Okay, so like...

397
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,740
Kony was like...

398
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,140
Has like a fucking nuclear bomb.

399
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,180
And he was like...

400
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,300
If I lose this, this goes off.

401
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,280
There's gonna be some mutual assured destruction.

402
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,160
And I was like...

403
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,260
Oh man, if we lose this...

404
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,100
We're gonna be here for...

405
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,820
More shit's gonna come.

406
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,300
And he was like...

407
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,980
I'm gonna break glass in case of emergency.

408
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,190
He was ready to say something.

409
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,040
And we didn't lose.

410
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,550
So I was like...

411
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,730
Oh thank god we won.

412
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,710
Thank god we can move on.

413
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,050
I was like...

414
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:02,130
Oh thank god.

415
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:05,130
We can move on.

416
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,390
And we win this.

417
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,490
And then...

418
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,790
And then like...

419
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,650
XQC was just like...

420
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:15,110
A fucking desert after that.

421
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:15,990
Like I didn't care.

422
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:17,730
I was alright after.

423
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:22,750
He was like...

424
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,370
I'm ready to burn all...

425
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:25,690
No, Kony was like...

426
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:28,010
I'm ready to burn all the bridges.

427
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,110
I was like...

428
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,030
Oh my god, Kony.

429
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:33,370
You shouldn't ask me for my push mission.

430
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,450
You know I'm an enabler.

431
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:35,890
I was like...

432
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,370
You know I'm a fucking enabler.

433
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,710
I'm not stopping you.

434
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,590
I'm not stopping you.

435
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,590
I'm not stopping you, Kony.

436
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:46,470
You know that.

437
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,030
But yeah, look forward to the video, fam.

438
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:53,130
Look forward to the video.

439
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:55,810
Whenever he uploads it.

440
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:58,010
I saw the script and I was like...

441
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:58,930
Oh my god.

442
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,430
Oh my god.

443
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,670
Oh my god.

444
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,670
Yeah, you see.

445
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:07,230
He was ready.

446
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,970
He was ready to burn everything.

447
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,850
Like burn every bridge.

448
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,810
I wasn't scared about the XQC match.

449
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:23,270
I was a little scared because I was like...

450
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,930
Why the fuck did you guys have to make it that close at the last game?

451
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,830
Like the last two games.

452
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:28,270
I was like...

453
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,890
You guys did not have to make it that close, guys.

454
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:35,690
I got a little scared when they lost the third game.

455
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,890
They lost the third game.

456
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,030
I was like...

457
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,230
Guys, come on.

458
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,710
Just pack it up.

459
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,070
I'm fucking tired.

460
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,970
I'm so tired.

461
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:50,610
But I'm glad.

462
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,990
But the content...

463
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:55,710
But I'm glad.

464
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,250
I'm really proud of my...

465
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:01,270
I'm really proud of my team.

466
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:04,310
And I'm proud of how well they did in the end.

467
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,050
Like a lot of them are now...

468
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:07,730
They're on a lot of people's radars.

469
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,010
I heard like...

470
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:13,710
Hogs and Gomez were both like...

471
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,330
Praised by a lot of giant content creators.

472
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,770
Like Tariq and Shroud.

473
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,410
They were spectating Gomez and Hogs.

474
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,610
And they were like...

475
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:24,350
They were like...

476
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:26,630
These guys are actually really cracked out.

477
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:31,150
And people crashing out over our 17-year-old kid.

478
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,450
17-year-old kid.

479
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,470
I'm like...

480
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:39,470
Bro,

481
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,870
she's 17, man.

482
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,950
Why are you crashing out on her?

483
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:52,590
You have legitimately years of experience.

484
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,770
And an insane career.

485
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,910
She literally made...

486
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,210
She made...

487
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:03,490
This has been the most money she's ever made in anything.

488
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,010
Like, come on, bro.

489
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:12,130
And she was playing with a broken mouse, man.

490
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,030
Bro, okay.

491
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:20,270
The craziest thing is that...

492
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,870
I don't think people realize.

493
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,750
She was playing Cloak and Dagger.

494
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,230
Cloak and Dagger, right now...

495
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:30,690
Is one of the easiest characters to play in Marvel Rivals.

496
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,190
At high ELO.

497
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,750
Because she doesn't require aim.

498
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,310
It's all just a mental warfare.

499
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:42,690
Cloak and Dagger is all about positioning and mental warfare.

500
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:43,710
That's really it.

501
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:45,570
It's just chess, playing Cloak and Dagger.

502
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,130
So, it's like...

503
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:51,630
Of course, it's super easy to pick up on.

504
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:54,290
And that's legitimately all she was grinding.

505
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:58,170
And she was getting coached by good players, too.

506
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,170
During the last week.

507
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:03,130
So I'm like, are you really complaining about...

508
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,610
A Cloak and Dagger player?

509
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:17,490
Are you really gonna complain about a Cloak and Dagger player?

510
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:18,330
Like...

511
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:29,830
If anything, you should complain about the people who were playing aim-intensive characters.

512
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:33,870
But were doing as well as a one-and-above-all player.

513
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,950
That's what you should be complaining about.

514
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:41,010
Not a fucking Cloak and Dagger.

515
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:46,410
That's crazy.

516
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:47,590
Anyway...

517
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,450
The tournament's over now.

518
00:21:53,390 --> 00:22:00,770
Everybody's gonna forget about the drama and all that shit within literally the next week or so.

519
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:09,750
And especially certain fans are just gonna move on to the next drama that's most likely to happen maybe tomorrow.

520
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:14,050
No, Doki!

521
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:16,710
No, you're just giving them more ammo!

522
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:19,350
You're just gonna put more of a target on you!

523
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:20,990
I'm on YouTube, like...

524
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:24,390
I'd be surprised if they ever venture out of Twitch.

525
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:27,490
Like, at best, they'll, like, fucking try to get me on Twitter.

526
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,870
But I'd be surprised if they ever venture here.

527
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:37,870
Yeah, and...

528
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:42,910
At best, I'm just gonna see the same two guys that's spamming Twitter about this.

529
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,990
Like, the fact that it's just...

530
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,810
Literally just one or two guys just...

531
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:55,890
Oh yeah, except for there's one guy that's everywhere that's been copy and pasting the same thing over and over on, like, multiple videos.

532
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:59,010
But he can't do it here because I already, like, banned him.

533
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,950
Because I was like, bro, what the fuck are you doing here?

534
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:01,750
Go back to Twitter.

535
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:09,070
I literally just instantly, like, hid his name.

536
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:09,930
Because, like...

537
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:13,810
Okay, the funniest thing is that he sees his own comments.

538
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,090
So he doesn't know he's banned.

539
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:20,570
Because there's, like, a function in YouTube where you just, like, hide user from this channel.

540
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:23,210
But, like, he'll see his own comments.

541
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:26,470
But, like, he won't know that he's banned.

542
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:29,010
Like, he won't...

543
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:29,210
Yeah.

544
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,390
He won't know.

545
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:35,470
So he'll just keep posting and being like, I got her now.

546
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,230
I got her now.

547
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:43,270
That's yelling into the void.

548
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,210
Yeah, so yeah, that was the...

549
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,970
That's the life update.

550
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:51,070
That was the life update regarding Marvel Rivals.

551
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:52,270
I'm really...

552
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,590
Like I said, I'm really happy.

553
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:58,890
I'm really happy with how well my team did.

554
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:02,070
And I hope that they have a great career right after.

555
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:07,070
I hope that a lot of them do really well with the new attention on them.

556
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:14,610
I heard that, like, Shroud was potentially looking at, like, Gomez and Hogs.

557
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:20,750
And, like, their performances and their team because of how well they were doing during this.

558
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,870
So I hope that leads to more paths for the rest of my team.

559
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:28,550
And then now everybody knows that Sabuku is, like, a fucking prodigy.

560
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:36,290
Like, being 17 and able to, like, you know, like, piss off some of the biggest content creators out there.

561
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:39,730
Like, crying over a 17-year-old kid.

562
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:42,930
Like, a 17-year-old girl, too.

563
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:54,790
And, like, you know, Coney being fucking Coney.

564
00:24:54,950 --> 00:25:00,970
And then there's Ms. Rock and Jaboni having people's eyes on them.

565
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:07,390
And, yeah, it's been a great... I'm really happy and proud of my team.

566
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:15,110
And, like, that's really all I wanted to update you on about Marble Rivals.

567
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:18,690
I actually haven't played Marble Rivals in a long time... in a while now.

568
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:22,590
I think for a couple of days ever since, like, the Twitch Rivals stuff happened.

569
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:25,110
I was also, like, incredibly busy, too.

570
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:30,130
And I was honestly, like, super busy.

571
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:32,130
It's not like I'm like, I HATE MARBLE RIVALS!

572
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:34,710
I was just really busy in between no date times.

573
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,390
Other than that, another life update.

574
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:46,250
The schedule is late because I am confirming a collab with someone.

575
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:49,990
And, like, she's really, really busy yet.

576
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:54,810
So, like, I don't know... I don't know if we're doing it this week.

577
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:58,770
But, like, I might post... I might just postpone it to next week.

578
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,290
Because, like, she's been really, really busy.

579
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:04,510
So, her on Discord, it's like she doesn't show up on Discord often.

580
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:08,290
So, it might be, like, next week or so.

581
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:12,250
So, if I don't get a reply by...

582
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:15,310
Like, whenever she replies back...

583
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:18,790
Whenever she replies back, I'm asleep or, like, I'm busy.

584
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:23,010
So, like, and then when I reply back, she's asleep or, like, she's busy.

585
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:23,890
So...

586
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:27,230
So, it's like...

587
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:30,370
It's, like, always this weird back and forth.

588
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:35,510
So, that's why, like, I couldn't... I couldn't, like, get it confirmed.

589
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:38,470
So, if... I'm gonna post a schedule by tonight.

590
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:43,050
If I don't hear anything back or we couldn't arrange anything for this week...

591
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:45,010
I'm just gonna post it by tonight.

592
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:48,050
And so, tomorrow, I'll be doing Toraba.

593
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:49,570
And...

594
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:51,430
Okay, let me look at my schedule again.

595
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,190
I... Honestly, I forgot what I'm doing.

596
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:56,030
I'll be doing Toraba at 12.30 tomorrow.

597
00:26:56,590 --> 00:27:03,190
And I'll be doing a member's watch-along of Borderlands the movie.

598
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:06,630
Because it's now $4 to rent it.

599
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:11,210
No!

600
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:12,890
Like, I'll be like...

601
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:13,090
Yay!

602
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,370
And then be like...

603
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:15,730
No!

604
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,540
It's now... You can now rent that movie, guys.

605
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,780
For $4.

606
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,160
So, you know what that means, everybody.

607
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,760
We're gonna be watching Borderlands.

608
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,000
We're gonna...

609
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,260
Good luck.

610
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,500
Come on, guys.

611
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,880
You know it'll be fun.

612
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,460
Come on, everybody.

613
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,280
Come on.

614
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,480
Don't you wanna watch Borderlands?

615
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,680
Come on, guys.

616
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,940
Join us.

617
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,120
The non-member goons are like...

618
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,560
Finally.

619
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,460
We're free.

620
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,420
The non-member goons are like...

621
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:51,940
Oh, my God.

622
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,480
Thank God.

623
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,260
I'm not a member.

624
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,420
And then Felia is like...

625
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,460
No, you're coming in here.

626
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,340
No, you're...

627
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,340
Felia, thank you for the five gifted chips.

628
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,140
He's like...

629
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:03,700
No, you're coming.

630
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,100
You're coming in here.

631
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,880
You're suffering with...

632
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,940
No, wait.

633
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:15,540
Wait.

634
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,200
Guys, being a member dragoon is both a curse and a blessing.

635
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,940
Guys, thank you for the super chat.

636
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:22,280
Thank you.

637
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:22,880
Thank you.

638
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:23,980
Many gifted...

639
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,480
Thank you for the five gifted chips.

640
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:25,940
He's like...

641
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,600
That's right.

642
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,720
Get in here, dragoons.

643
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,920
Get your ass in here.

644
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,860
We're all going to be watching.

645
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,360
We're all going to be watching Borderlands.

646
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,760
JohnnyLeCone, thank you for the 20 gifted chips.

647
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,120
Thank you.

648
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:40,580
Thank you.

649
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:44,160
Mac, thank you with the five gifted chips.

650
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:44,600
Thank you.

651
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,400
Thank you.

652
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,580
All right.

653
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,080
All right.

654
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,600
Anyway, so that is...

655
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,540
That is the current...

656
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,300
Oh, it's a bite size.

657
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,980
Bite size and blazing.

658
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,660
Thank you for the five and 20 gifted chips.

659
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:57,940
Thank you.

660
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,420
Thank you.

661
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,680
Thank you for the 10 gifted chips.

662
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:02,460
Thank you.

663
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:02,980
Thank you.

664
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,020
But yes, that is the...

665
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,360
That is the schedule for tomorrow.

666
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,540
And then, I don't know about the rest for now.

667
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,820
Because everything is up in the air for now.

668
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,840
Regarding what I'm going to be doing.

669
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:21,100
Depending on if the collab is confirmed for this week or next week.

670
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,780
Originally, she asked for Sunday.

671
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,500
But I usually don't stream on Sunday.

672
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,200
And I feel weird to put it on Sunday.

673
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,860
Because I just feel like...

674
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,600
Since my schedule...

675
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,000
Usually, I don't post my schedule early.

676
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,120
So, I was like...

677
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:38,700
I feel better if people can prepare for it and stuff like that.

678
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,940
So, it's either going to be this week or next week.

679
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,600
So, I'm not sure.

680
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,380
Who is this collab with?

681
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,800
I don't want to confirm anything yet.

682
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,640
Because I don't want to be like...

683
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,040
People are going to start pressuring stuff and things like that.

684
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,040
So, no.

685
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,100
Not going to leak it this time.

686
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,900
I'm not leaking who I'm collabing with.

687
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,860
You'll see if it's confirmed.

688
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:58,760
You'll see.

689
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,180
Stuff Sharky.

690
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:04,880
Neppers.

691
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:06,600
MrBrokenBond.

692
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,380
Thank you for the 5 and 10 gifted chips.

693
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:13,480
I like how Akachi just joined on their own free will.

694
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,960
This guy was like...

695
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,600
Oh my god.

696
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:19,100
I can finally watch my favorite movie.

697
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:19,900
Borderlands.

698
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,680
This guy.

699
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:29,600
This guy actually joined on his own free will.

700
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,780
He was like...

701
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,420
Oh my god.

702
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,940
I'm so excited, guys.

703
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,460
Oh my god.

704
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,340
Finally, I can actually use this membership.

705
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,860
And watch something I've been waiting for forever.

706
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,500
This was the moment that made them subscribe.

707
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:51,800
That made them join the tomato farm.

708
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,620
They're like...

709
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,560
Say less.

710
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,200
We're watching Borderlands.

711
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,500
Say fucking less.

712
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:06,960
The one Borderlands fan is him.

713
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,820
Say less, queen.

714
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,860
I would...

715
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,940
There was nothing else that wanted me to join the membership until today.

716
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,680
This is the strongest Borderlands fan.

717
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,160
Mike and Duck.

718
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,640
Thank you for the 50 gifted chips.

719
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,240
Thank you for the 5 gifted chips.

720
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:32,560
Thank you.

721
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,160
Thank you.

722
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,620
Odin, thank you for the super chat.

723
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:34,940
Thank you.

724
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,260
Thank you.

725
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,440
Now is that we don't stop her next...

726
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,060
Oh, you.

727
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,280
Thank you for the super chat.

728
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:39,660
Thank you.

729
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:39,980
Thank you.

730
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:43,480
Oh, that's so cute that you think we didn't watch Assassin's Creed.

731
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,460
That's so cute.

732
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,860
We watched it all.

733
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,200
Oh, JK.

734
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,400
You think...

735
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,640
You think we didn't...

736
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,260
If you think of a bad movie...

737
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,860
We watched it.

738
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,920
We fucking watched it.

739
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,560
Alright.

740
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:09,260
Alright, we're actually playing Dynasty Warriors now.

741
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,720
Sorry for the long delay.

742
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,820
We're finally gonna play Dynasty Warriors.

743
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:14,560
I'm super excited.

744
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,940
It might be a longer stream than usual.

745
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,920
Because I found out this game is like 25 to 30 hours long.

746
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:23,460
That's...

747
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,480
I was like, oh man, I might have...

748
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:32,340
We went from one super long series to the next super long series.

749
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:36,580
So we're gonna be here for a bit.

750
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,300
I didn't realize, guys.

751
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:45,560
I didn't realize how long the series is.

752
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,760
Okay, so thank you for the five gifted ships.

753
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,320
Thank you for the five gifted ships.

754
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,660
Okay, I didn't even remember how to play.

755
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,700
But yeah, I wanna do a long stream today.

756
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,640
I feel like we've been doing a lot of like...

757
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,020
Oh my god, I forgot.

758
00:32:59,220 --> 00:32:59,720
Spikes hurt.

759
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,560
I've been doing like a lot of like super long game series though.

760
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,460
I noticed that.

761
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:08,440
Okay, I didn't remember how to fight, guys.

762
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,580
I actually forgot.

763
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,680
Okay, which is bad.

764
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,000
Oh shit, I...

765
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:16,620
Freedom!

766
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,980
I didn't forget about that though.

767
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:22,980
Freedom!

768
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,540
Okay.

769
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,840
Alright, we figured that out.

770
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:33,140
Alright, I just killed the eight foot fucking god right there.

771
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:34,280
Meow.

772
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,120
Honestly, my favorite feature.

773
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,560
Alright, we're gonna...

774
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,340
Like my whole mission is to get to Lu Bu.

775
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,140
That's really it, honestly.

776
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,960
That is my entire mission.

777
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,920
We are here to kill Lu Bu.

778
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,520
We shall pursue Lu Bu.

779
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,120
Don't worry, me, a guy that was written out of history.

780
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,680
I can take him.

781
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,820
I know I can.

782
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:02,900
Wait, where did he go?

783
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:03,480
Did I kill him?

784
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,680
Oh my god, I faced the wrong direction.

785
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,220
I...

786
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,060
I actually faced the wrong...

787
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,300
Are you fucking serious?

788
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:14,680
I faced the wrong direction with my Musou.

789
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:21,100
Okay, people who don't pursue Lu Bu are fucking...

790
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,840
Are fucking betas, dude.

791
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,440
Nice.

792
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,380
I parried.

793
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,540
That's fucking right.

794
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,460
Get out of here.

795
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,640
You can't kill Lu Bu.

796
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,760
You might as well revoke your...

797
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,760
You might as well uninstall Dynasty War...

798
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:40,520
You're not a Dynasty Warrior gamer if you don't pursue Lu Bu.

799
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,240
Did I not kill all of them?

800
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,460
Yeah, and now I win.

801
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:46,980
I thought I killed all of them.

802
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,860
Oh my god, what is my actual mission?

803
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:49,380
What?

804
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,880
Okay, okay.

805
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,100
Next up, this area.

806
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:57,740
Exactly.

807
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,280
You know what I heard?

808
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:03,460
Okay, so you know how I'm saying like everybody in this game is now super handsome?

809
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,760
So, what I heard...

810
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,380
Is that they made...

811
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,140
Oh, what's his name?

812
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,460
I always forget his name because I don't give a fuck about him.

813
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:13,420
And like, I hate him as a character and a historical figure.

814
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,080
But the...

815
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,460
What was his name?

816
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,920
It's the...

817
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,240
It's like, it's Lu Bu's...

818
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,300
It's Lu Bu's leader.

819
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:23,760
What's his name?

820
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,540
I hate him as everything.

821
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,280
Dong...

822
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,280
Yeah, Dong Zhuo.

823
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,300
Dong Zhao.

824
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,940
I don't fucking know how to pronounce him.

825
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,260
I don't even care about him.

826
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,280
They made him handsome too.

827
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:38,080
And I'm like, he is known in history to be the ugliest, fattest motherfucker.

828
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,360
Like...

829
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,760
I was like, no way.

830
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,200
They made him handsome?

831
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,380
Yeah, no.

832
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,440
Okay, we're gonna see him.

833
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,780
I didn't see any pictures of it yet.

834
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,760
But people were like, oh, I can't wait for her.

835
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:58,060
I can't wait for her to see him.

836
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,880
No, everybody actually got a glow up.

837
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,320
It's crazy.

838
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,580
He's like, skinnier too.

839
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,940
He was known to be like, fat and ugly.

840
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,200
But with a very hot wife.

841
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,240
Who gets like, stolen by Lu Bu.

842
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,020
But like, so...

843
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,700
Historically inaccurate.

844
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,500
He was known to be fat and ugly.

845
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,560
And like, and evil.

846
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,120
But then they like, be like...

847
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,160
This game was like, okay.

848
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,860
But what if he's misunderstood?

849
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,460
I'm like, I don't want him to be misunderstood!

850
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,160
I don't...

851
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,900
I don't...

852
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,000
I don't want him to be misunderstood.

853
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,500
They just like me.

854
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,200
But Doki, these are his origins.

855
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,280
Oh, I can have accessories now.

856
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,560
You can select which to equip on equipment.

857
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,960
Oh, battle arts.

858
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:03,720
Oh, okay.

859
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,300
Wait, do I have upgrades for it now?

860
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,220
I can do whirlwind kick.

861
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:07,800
Nice.

862
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,580
It's because you never know him after he hit puberty.

863
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,240
Brabs, thank you for the super chat.

864
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,140
Thank you, thank you.

865
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:18,440
I don't want him to be misunderstood!

866
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,300
I want to hate him!

867
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,880
I don't care!

868
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,440
He's a terrible person.

869
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:30,860
Gracias, Doki.

870
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,240
Gracious, gracias, Doki.

871
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,580
Please let us watch a good movie like the...

872
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,760
Dark Blade.

873
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:45,240
That's so cute that you think we're ever gonna watch a good movie.

874
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,280
Thank you for the super chat.

875
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,420
Thank you, thank you.

876
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,400
Neppers, thank you for the super chat.

877
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,300
Thank you, thank you.

878
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:51,900
Kaz!

879
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,100
Oh, wait, what?

880
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,320
Oh, wait, that's just free stuff.

881
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,240
Do I have anything?

882
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,000
No, okay.

883
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,480
Kaz, thank you for the super chat.

884
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,080
Thank you, thank you.

885
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:05,000
I should travel to this period of ancient China to become handsome, too.

886
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,320
Thank you for the super chat.

887
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,040
Kaz, thank you, thank you.

888
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,160
We will kill...

889
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,500
We will pursue Lupo.

890
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,740
We are not ending until we pursue him.

891
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,320
Guys, that is our mission.

892
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,620
We don't end until he has been pursued.

893
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,180
I ain't no coward.

894
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,220
He shall remember me in history.

895
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:25,880
I shall rewrite the romance of the three kingdoms.

896
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:30,820
Alright, nice.

897
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,380
You know what's crazy?

898
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,580
That TikTok was just gone for like legitimately like one day.

899
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,340
It wasn't even 24 hours!

900
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,000
Wait, no!

901
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,400
I was like, you didn't even make it 24 hours?

902
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:51,960
That's actually insane.

903
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:59,040
He didn't even give us the pleasure of fucking grieving for TikTok for 24 hours.

904
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:03,500
It was just 6 hours.

905
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,840
That's actually crazy.

906
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,940
I was like, oh my god.

907
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:17,920
And then I see all these depressing tweets from like memes and tweets about how they're like, oh man, I'm so depressed and sad and legitimately like fucking...

908
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,480
I'm gonna download all the best TikToks ever!

909
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,280
And then 6 hours later, JK.

910
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,740
Oh wait, it was 14 hours.

911
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,120
14 hours later, JK.

912
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:35,180
My death was greatly exaggerated.

913
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,240
Nice.

914
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:41,700
Alright, nice.

915
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:42,340
Alright.

916
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,940
Come on, get over here.

917
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,640
You might be 6 feet.

918
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,920
But I'm a short king.

919
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:50,520
Yay!

920
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,980
Yosh, thank you for the super chat.

921
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:54,800
Thank you, thank you.

922
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:55,840
Jokes on you, Doki.

923
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,000
Can't watch the movie.

924
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,920
I'm working on the road.

925
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,500
Yosh, thank you for the super chat.

926
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,200
Thank you, thank you.

927
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,700
Jarhod, thank you for the super chat.

928
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:03,380
Thank you, thank you.

929
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:07,260
New war cry in Dynasty Warriors Origins for not Doki!

930
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,800
Thank you for the super chat.

931
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,960
Thank you, thank you.

932
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,740
Tasty, thank you for the super chat.

933
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,400
Can we watch Blue Beetle next?

934
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,800
Wait, I actually never heard...

935
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,720
I know, like, the character Blue Beetle.

936
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,680
But I feel like I've heard nothing about Blue Beetle.

937
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,360
Like, the movie itself.

938
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,180
It's so bad that no one talks about it.

939
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:30,620
So it means that it's so bad that it's just mediocre.

940
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,480
That's how bad it must be.

941
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,680
Oh, there's an elder here.

942
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,600
Hello, stranger.

943
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:39,740
Yes, indeed.

944
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,400
Here, take this with you.

945
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:45,960
Sword.

946
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:46,980
Okay.

947
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:47,720
Oh!

948
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,440
Slash around you?

949
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,940
No, I don't want to use the sword.

950
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,640
You need to hone both mind and body.

951
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,620
Wish to survive the chaos of this era.

952
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:57,700
One more thing.

953
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,480
I have brothers living here and there.

954
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,140
If you meet any of them, speak with them.

955
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,740
Oh, they can, like, give me stuff.

956
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:03,900
Ooh, secret.

957
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:05,540
Gold coin.

958
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:12,120
We might be here for a while because this is one of the few games that I might do side quest in.

959
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:16,920
Because Dynasty Warriors is such a favorite of mine.

960
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,400
Like, I just...

961
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:24,500
I just love Dynasty Warriors so much that I actually really want to do side content.

962
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:31,020
No, it's because, like, I grew up with Dyna...

963
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:34,240
Like, it's legitimately one of my favorite games of all time.

964
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,460
Because, like, I grew up with this game and it's, like, my childhood and everything.

965
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:42,240
That I actually do not mind doing side content for.

966
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,620
Where is the fucking guy?

967
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,240
It's just all the little guys.

968
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,500
Well, I don't care about the little guys.

969
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:51,980
They don't... Their lives don't matter.

970
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,300
They're just ult charges.

971
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,160
Your lives don't matter.

972
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,640
You're just a number to me.

973
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:57,720
You don't...

974
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,660
I don't care that I just killed a million fathers.

975
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:04,180
And all your wives are gonna become widows.

976
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,800
I don't care.

977
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,860
That's fucking right.

978
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:13,540
Oh, that's it.

979
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:14,120
There you go.

980
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:14,640
Oh, okay.

981
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,120
That's how little they matter.

982
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,520
Just these.

983
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,400
Thank you for the super chat.

984
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:21,180
Thank you, thank you.

985
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,520
You wish to pursue Lu Bu.

986
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:25,860
Didn't know you saw him in a romantic way.

987
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,860
Okay, thank you for the super chat.

988
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:28,980
Thank you, thank you.

989
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,300
That's right.

990
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,140
I'm here to grind those bodies.

991
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,640
Alright, Battle of Wan Castle.

992
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:38,740
Am I level 4?

993
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:39,440
I am.

994
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:40,560
Alright.

995
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:46,660
The Yellow Turbans in Jin Province have been driven into Wan Castle to defeat...

996
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,520
Jiang Nan?

997
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,140
Oh my god!

998
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,640
I'm gonna defeat hot Chinese Jesus?

999
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,500
Why is he...

1000
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,580
Did you know I just found out Sun Jian is supposed to be like...

1001
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:03,980
A similar...

1002
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:04,640
The similar...

1003
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,000
A similar age with like one other general.

1004
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:07,940
I forgot who.

1005
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:10,980
Oh wait, no.

1006
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:11,480
It's...

1007
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,800
Oh, his younger bro...

1008
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,260
Oh, sorry.

1009
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,420
His younger brother.

1010
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:16,940
Wrong guy.

1011
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,180
His enemy is...

1012
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,280
Oh yeah, that's not him.

1013
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:21,300
That's not him.

1014
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,700
Yeah, Sun Jian and Qiao Qiao...

1015
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:28,740
Are supposed to be the same age, but then Sun Jian...

1016
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:29,980
Like, he's so...

1017
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:34,140
Why does he look so old?

1018
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:34,900
Okay, sorry.

1019
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,180
Jian Jiao is the leader.

1020
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:38,600
Jiang Nan...

1021
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:39,880
It's so weird.

1022
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:40,460
I just...

1023
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:42,180
I don't...

1024
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,980
He's always been a crazy wizard.

1025
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,220
And now he's like...

1026
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:46,520
Hot.

1027
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,020
It's so weird!

1028
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:51,580
I...

1029
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:54,180
Like, I cannot...

1030
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:55,520
Register it.

1031
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:02,860
Alright.

1032
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:06,020
I'm gonna go and kill the big guys.

1033
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,820
Because like, I don't trust...

1034
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:12,200
I don't trust Sun Jian to live if I defeat all the little guys.

1035
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,020
Like, after...

1036
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:17,240
After almost killing Qiao Qiao...

1037
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:20,460
I feel like if I try to kill the little guys...

1038
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,620
I'm just gonna bring them to death.

1039
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:24,420
I'm gonna bring them...

1040
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,520
I'm gonna bring them all to die.

1041
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:29,940
Wait, is that one guy?

1042
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,900
No way!

1043
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:34,460
There's no way!

1044
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,220
Wait, is that him?

1045
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,480
Why does he look like that?

1046
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,180
Oh my god.

1047
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,340
Why are they all...

1048
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:45,280
Oh my god.

1049
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:53,000
Oh my god.

1050
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,520
Oh my god.

1051
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:57,700
There's...

1052
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:59,040
There is...

1053
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,420
Oh!

1054
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:03,580
No, it's Huang Gai!

1055
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:04,700
Look at him!

1056
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,400
It's not so old, Huang Gai.

1057
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:09,980
Oh my god!

1058
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:12,380
I've never seen him young before!

1059
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:16,420
I've never seen him so young!

1060
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:19,940
It's...

1061
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:20,700
Why...

1062
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:24,180
Oh my god, look at him!

1063
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:27,460
Okay, so like, for those who don't know what he looks like...

1064
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,360
This is what he's normally...

1065
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,160
This is what he normally looks like.

1066
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,700
He normally looks like a...

1067
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:37,960
He also usually has a mohawk, but...

1068
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:42,680
From the side profile, I can tell, like...

1069
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:46,160
Cause like, why is he younger than Sun Jian?!

1070
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,380
Why did they...

1071
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:51,160
Why did they make him younger than Sun Jian?!

1072
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,200
Of all people!

1073
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,000
I feel like he'd be...

1074
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,160
He should be older than him, right?

1075
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:57,960
I don't know.

1076
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,640
I feel like this is how he's supposed to look like.

1077
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:01,540
Like...

1078
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,540
You don't wanna...

1079
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:08,720
Bro, he's supposed to be a...

1080
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,020
He's supposed to be a gilf, but they made him a dilf.

1081
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:14,640
And he's somehow younger than...

1082
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,600
Than the other guy.

1083
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:20,600
Yo, where's our old man?!

1084
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,600
Where did he go?!

1085
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:29,540
Alright.

1086
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:37,420
As the head of a military family, I'm not lacking in skill, but anything can happen on the field of battle.

1087
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,940
We will need everyone's strength.

1088
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,140
Now allow me to explain our plan for the siege.

1089
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:46,420
Our strategy is to break through the castle gates with a baton ram to give our men a path inside.

1090
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,340
The base in front of the castle will be critical to our success.

1091
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,500
We will take it and then use the supplies to construct the ram.

1092
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:53,940
Oh, fuck!

1093
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,700
Okay, there's gonna be a lot of arrows then.

1094
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,080
Lord Ju Jian will assault the castle.

1095
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,980
We will provide support by engaging the enemy.

1096
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:00,860
Alright.

1097
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:03,320
Okay, we don't care about these guys.

1098
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:06,260
Our favorite horses will be well suited to this sort of mission.

1099
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:07,240
We will take care of it.

1100
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,080
Wait, who do I follow?

1101
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,480
I swear to God, if they die, I swear to fucking God.

1102
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:15,500
Alright,

1103
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,380
I'm ready to begin.

1104
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:25,380
Jarhud, thank you for the super chat.

1105
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,500
Thank you, thank you.

1106
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,100
New side quest, I'm the Pursuit of Lube Beauty.

1107
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:30,500
Thank you for the super chat.

1108
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:31,460
Thank you, thank you.

1109
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,640
For the first time, I'm actually gonna...

1110
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:40,940
I'm actually gonna do side quests for the first time in my streaming career.

1111
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,720
I've never done side quests before until today.

1112
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,300
Oh yeah, do I have to actually pick a kingdom?

1113
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:55,060
Guys, for this...

1114
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,760
Do I actually have to pick a kingdom?

1115
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:00,980
Or can I follow all of them?

1116
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:03,720
For this game.

1117
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,080
Wait, I do?!

1118
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,620
Yeah, but not for a while.

1119
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,100
I think I might...

1120
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,100
I don't know.

1121
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:14,620
I literally don't know which kingdom I'd pick for...

1122
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:17,100
I don't wanna play as...

1123
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,240
It's either gonna be Wu or Xu.

1124
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:22,680
I think.

1125
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,420
Because I enjoy...

1126
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:25,920
Xu has some like...

1127
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,480
Xu for Zhuge Liang.

1128
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,300
Zhuge Liang?

1129
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:33,640
I wouldn't pick Xu just because I love Zhuge Liang.

1130
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:36,920
Because I love his story and I'm obsessed with him.

1131
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:39,580
Wait, what?

1132
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:41,040
Who's shooting me?

1133
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,200
Oh my god, it's the...

1134
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,620
Fucking, I hate these archers.

1135
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,860
But like, that's like...

1136
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,040
That's...I don't know.

1137
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,600
That's only for that.

1138
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,580
Put Tao Tao!

1139
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:57,800
Who's there?

1140
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,600
I hate...

1141
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:04,400
I...I think I'll...

1142
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,220
I'm definitely gonna...

1143
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:05,870
I'm gonna do...

1144
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,740
For sure, I'm gonna fucking come after you.

1145
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:08,140
I don't care.

1146
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,540
I'm coming after you.

1147
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:11,340
I don't care about the little guys.

1148
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:12,240
You're all just...

1149
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,540
All charges for me.

1150
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:15,100
I...Oh fuck!

1151
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,140
Okay, um...

1152
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:18,840
The stupid arrows.

1153
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:19,280
Like...

1154
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:22,040
Oh my god.

1155
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,640
You stupid arrows!

1156
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:27,320
Okay.

1157
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:28,380
That's fine.

1158
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:29,320
That's fine.

1159
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,020
I don't care.

1160
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,800
Those arrows do nothing for me.

1161
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:33,700
You think I care?

1162
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,520
That's fucking right.

1163
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:36,900
I don't care.

1164
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:38,600
That's fucking right.

1165
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,120
You might have the arrows.

1166
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,340
And I might be like...

1167
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:42,900
Just getting poked by the arrows.

1168
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,260
But I don't...

1169
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:45,280
They're like, please!

1170
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:46,740
Use block!

1171
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,860
I can't block all the time!

1172
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,560
There's too much stuff!

1173
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,040
Okay.

1174
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:56,720
No, it's fine.

1175
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:57,060
It's fine.

1176
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:57,560
Look at that.

1177
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:57,800
See?

1178
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:00,500
Okay, there you go.

1179
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:01,480
It's fine.

1180
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,060
It's fine.

1181
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:03,300
I don't...

1182
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,120
It's fine, guys.

1183
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:04,680
It's fine.

1184
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:05,360
It's so...

1185
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,000
It's fine.

1186
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:06,880
It's fine, guys.

1187
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:07,220
It's...

1188
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:08,060
I'm so healthy.

1189
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:09,740
Guys, it's so...

1190
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:09,940
See?

1191
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:10,400
Look at that.

1192
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:11,000
I killed him.

1193
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,160
There we go.

1194
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,040
It's just that easy.

1195
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:16,740
I might have like...

1196
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:19,240
Those arrows are just acupuncture.

1197
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:19,840
Exactly.

1198
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:20,420
They're just...

1199
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:23,620
It's just...

1200
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:26,480
They're just acupunctures, guys.

1201
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,020
It's nothing to me.

1202
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:32,800
Alright.

1203
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:33,540
Let's see.

1204
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:35,140
We defeated one of the big bosses.

1205
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,520
So we don't have to worry about these guys now.

1206
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,160
They're like, please!

1207
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:39,680
Don't...

1208
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,100
Please!

1209
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:41,240
Please block!

1210
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,840
Please block the arrows!

1211
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,660
For the love of God!

1212
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:47,020
Just block them.

1213
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:49,400
Oh, you thought you have reinforcements?

1214
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:50,460
That's fucking right.

1215
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:53,740
No reinforcements for...

1216
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:54,540
Jesus Christ!

1217
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:55,660
I can barely like...

1218
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:59,420
Attack anybody because of the arrows.

1219
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:00,700
It's actually so annoying though.

1220
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:03,320
I fucking hate the arrow shit.

1221
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:04,920
Alright.

1222
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:06,500
Get out of here.

1223
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:08,600
Okay, please.

1224
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:09,580
They're nothing.

1225
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:10,840
It's just acupuncture.

1226
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:14,580
I'm just getting more relaxed the more they send more arrows at me.

1227
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:16,260
Nice.

1228
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:16,580
Alright.

1229
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:19,680
Oh shit.

1230
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:19,960
Wait.

1231
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,360
Where's Hwang guy?

1232
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:22,440
Who needs help?

1233
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:24,300
Who needs help?

1234
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:25,920
Oh shit.

1235
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:26,220
Don't worry.

1236
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:26,800
I'm coming after.

1237
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:27,200
Don't worry.

1238
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:27,520
I'm coming.

1239
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:28,480
I'm coming over.

1240
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:29,140
Don't worry!

1241
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:30,400
Don't worry, sir!

1242
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,160
I should really destroy these.

1243
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:35,640
Sorry.

1244
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,100
Let me actually give...

1245
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:38,980
Destroy them.

1246
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:40,120
Burn him down!

1247
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,240
Burn him down!

1248
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:44,040
That's fucking right!

1249
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:48,940
Make sure they're still in there when you burn him down!

1250
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:52,480
That's fucking right!

1251
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:55,580
Doki, that's arson!

1252
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:56,400
And?

1253
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:57,780
And...

1254
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:03,240
And make sure the entire family is still in the building.

1255
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:06,840
That's right.

1256
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,640
Burn it all down.

1257
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:10,420
Press the button.

1258
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:12,920
Alright, let me get rid of this guy too.

1259
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,020
Shit.

1260
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:16,000
Oh my god.

1261
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:17,160
I should eat the bread right now.

1262
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:18,020
I should eat...

1263
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:19,580
I'm...

1264
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:23,220
Okay, it is a little concerning that I only have one button left.

1265
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:24,660
It is a little...

1266
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:25,180
Oh shit!

1267
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:26,460
I was supposed to be left side Doki.

1268
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:27,940
I forgot for this game.

1269
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,480
I'm supposed to be left side Doki.

1270
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:31,880
Alright.

1271
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,460
They can take care of the rest now.

1272
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:35,260
Alright.

1273
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:38,080
I'll be left side Doki after...

1274
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:38,480
Wait.

1275
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:38,740
Alright.

1276
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:39,440
Where's the...

1277
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,340
Where's another archer?

1278
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:41,300
I'm gonna burn it down.

1279
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:43,300
Oh, I know you're here.

1280
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:44,480
No!

1281
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:47,440
Okay.

1282
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,940
Our ram needs to be reconstructed.

1283
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:51,000
Real quick.

1284
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:52,380
Let me get rid of...

1285
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:53,160
Let me get rid of this...

1286
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:53,500
Oh shit!

1287
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,660
Hong Gai, please!

1288
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:55,540
You're not even...

1289
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:56,080
Oh shit!

1290
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,340
Hong Gai, please!

1291
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,680
Oh Jesus Christ, you're so young.

1292
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,000
Oh my god, you're so young.

1293
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:06,800
Okay, where are the arrows?

1294
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:09,240
I'm ready to burn more things down.

1295
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,300
Okay, we gotta kill him.

1296
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:14,620
We gotta kill the...

1297
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:15,920
He doesn't even have a name.

1298
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:17,960
That's how irrelevant you are.

1299
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,280
You don't even have...

1300
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,420
The history book will not remember you.

1301
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,820
That's why no one knows who you are.

1302
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:29,040
Wait, this game has young Hwang?

1303
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:29,840
Yeah, I know.

1304
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:30,900
It's so weird.

1305
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,620
It's so weird!

1306
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,100
He's so young!

1307
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:37,240
I'm not...

1308
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:38,380
I'm not used to it.

1309
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:39,340
Are they okay over there?

1310
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:41,080
Oh, they're so healthy over there.

1311
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:42,900
I like how like...

1312
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:45,900
We're still waiting for our ram to get there.

1313
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,240
And then Liu Bei...

1314
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,340
Liu Bei's team is just like...

1315
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:51,480
Feeding the shit out of everybody inside right now.

1316
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:52,900
We're like, give me a sec!

1317
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:54,440
We're almost there!

1318
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:56,760
I'm sorry, I got distracted!

1319
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:00,240
Give me a sec!

1320
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:04,000
I got really distracted, Liu Bei!

1321
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:05,860
Give me a minute!

1322
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:08,140
I'm sure he's fine.

1323
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:10,820
At this point, they're...

1324
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:11,500
Oh, they opened!

1325
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:12,500
Oh, thanks guys!

1326
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:13,040
Thanks!

1327
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,560
Oh, we did it!

1328
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:18,740
We did it!

1329
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:26,180
I rolled up the ram and they just opened the door.

1330
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:28,800
They're like, alright, here you go.

1331
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:31,740
What was the point?

1332
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:33,980
We rebuilt that too!

1333
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,440
We actually...

1334
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,040
Oh shit, I forgot you can't...

1335
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,900
We rebuilt that for no reason!

1336
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:45,080
Guys, it's the ef...

1337
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,060
Guys, but the effort though.

1338
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:51,280
Guys, but it's the effort though.

1339
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:52,780
Guys...

1340
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:53,400
Wait, is this?

1341
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:55,220
No, that's not actual buns.

1342
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,920
We need like actual jars though.

1343
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:59,900
Wait, has summon enemy forces?

1344
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:02,500
Where?

1345
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:05,300
Alright.

1346
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:06,600
Oh, that's fine.

1347
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:07,600
Freedom!

1348
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:14,520
Don't worry.

1349
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:18,300
Oh my god, why is he 8 feet tall?!

1350
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:29,830
Alright, it's over here.

1351
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:32,690
Feel the power of my magic!

1352
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,390
Alright, smash this.

1353
00:55:35,350 --> 00:55:36,870
Alright, there's more than one.

1354
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:38,470
Where's the next one?

1355
00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:40,210
Jesus Christ, you're so tall!

1356
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:43,730
Good ol' evil magic.

1357
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:45,410
Where could the next one be then?

1358
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:46,830
The other side?

1359
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:49,790
Okay, it has to be on the other side then.

1360
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:52,110
I wish I have a horse.

1361
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:55,010
It has to be on the other side.

1362
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:56,930
12 feet tall.

1363
00:55:57,370 --> 00:55:58,670
What are they feeding?

1364
00:55:58,850 --> 00:55:59,430
Oh my god!

1365
00:55:59,570 --> 00:56:00,470
Oh my god!

1366
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:02,030
They built a wall!

1367
00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:03,410
Holy shit!

1368
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:04,530
How did it get bigger?!

1369
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:07,070
They actually built a wall!

1370
00:56:07,370 --> 00:56:08,370
What the fuck?!

1371
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:10,230
Oh my god!

1372
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:11,550
Like, what do I do?!

1373
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:14,250
They actually built a fucking wall!

1374
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:16,730
Oh my god!

1375
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:18,310
Where's the hole?!

1376
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:24,790
Oh my god, the Great Wall of China right there.

1377
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:27,650
It was actually made of people.

1378
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:29,350
Who would've thought?

1379
00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:32,430
Oh no, where is it?

1380
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:33,930
Where's the jar?

1381
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:36,370
I can't tell.

1382
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:39,630
It's like... here?

1383
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:41,910
I can't tell.

1384
00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:43,650
I can't tell!

1385
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:46,050
I can't tell!

1386
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:47,690
There's so many people!

1387
00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:51,490
Is it here?

1388
00:56:53,570 --> 00:56:55,610
Oh my god, there's too many.

1389
00:56:57,370 --> 00:56:58,270
Oh my god!

1390
00:56:58,330 --> 00:56:59,690
I'm trying my best!

1391
00:57:01,090 --> 00:57:03,390
There's a huge wall in front of me!

1392
00:57:07,850 --> 00:57:09,190
Okay, I got it.

1393
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:11,150
That should be over.

1394
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:13,490
Nice,

1395
00:57:16,970 --> 00:57:17,650
we did it.

1396
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:24,190
That's the sound of freedom if I've ever heard it.

1397
00:57:25,490 --> 00:57:27,350
Giga, thank you for the super chat.

1398
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:28,350
Thank you, thank you.

1399
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:30,350
Alright, I'm a little fucked.

1400
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:33,190
I don't have heals at all.

1401
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:37,530
Oh no!

1402
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:40,510
Where are the buns?

1403
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:42,950
Where are the buns?

1404
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:50,130
I don't know where the buns are!

1405
00:57:50,490 --> 00:57:51,890
Where are the mantel?

1406
00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:56,210
Please, somebody feed me!

1407
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:02,210
Oh no.

1408
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:06,390
I'm looking for some buns right now.

1409
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:07,730
Are they okay over there?

1410
00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:10,670
Chenpoo, are you okay?

1411
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:13,990
Oh hey, the morale has risen.

1412
00:58:18,690 --> 00:58:20,730
Okay, is there like fellow bread?

1413
00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:23,590
Any fellow bread in Jo- HOLY SHIT!

1414
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:24,910
Okay, he just grew up!

1415
00:58:25,370 --> 00:58:26,290
Did you saw that?

1416
00:58:28,610 --> 00:58:30,750
He like actually just grew up!

1417
00:58:31,810 --> 00:58:32,370
Nice.

1418
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:34,030
That's right, get parried.

1419
00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:36,290
Get parried.

1420
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:36,570
Get parried.

1421
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:38,890
Oh shit, where are you?

1422
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:40,670
Wait.

1423
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:42,430
Oh, that's not what I wanted to do.

1424
00:58:42,930 --> 00:58:44,030
Oh shit, it's okay.

1425
00:58:44,930 --> 00:58:46,050
There's no way I'm gonna get hit.

1426
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:48,650
I'm getting- guys, guys, this is bad.

1427
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:50,070
I'm sort of getting hit right now.

1428
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:57,670
Oh my god, I'm not even getting hit by like- Okay, the worst part is I'm not even getting hit by like him.

1429
00:58:57,790 --> 00:58:59,510
I'm getting hit by his little guys.

1430
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:02,650
There we go.

1431
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:03,310
Easy.

1432
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:05,030
Yay!

1433
00:59:09,350 --> 00:59:13,070
That's right, I'm gonna kill your brother just like I'm gonna kill you.

1434
00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:23,410
Alright, this is where soon-chan's just gonna get a heart attack.

1435
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:25,270
And we never see him again.

1436
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:29,670
Oh my god.

1437
00:59:29,910 --> 00:59:34,010
If I see him for more than two more battles, I'd be very surprised.

1438
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:37,550
I- I'm not- no, no.

1439
00:59:38,330 --> 00:59:43,370
I'd definitely be very surprised if he lives longer than two more battles.

1440
00:59:43,570 --> 00:59:51,130
I- Oh, spoilers.

1441
00:59:51,370 --> 00:59:59,690
Please, please don't spoil me a game that has been retoad for like- 20- Not even- For 30- 25 years.

1442
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:01,570
Not even 25.

1443
01:00:02,050 --> 01:00:07,650
This game has been retoad for 30 years and- Like- And now we're still here.

1444
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:09,390
And we're still here.

1445
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:20,940
Don't spoil the 1500 year old book.

1446
01:00:33,790 --> 01:00:35,790
Wait, no way!

1447
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:40,330
I wanna pause this game right now!

1448
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:54,770
Did you just see who- Did you see who the two people next to them was?

1449
01:01:34,570 --> 01:01:38,230
Yeah, they got a little bit cult-y after we left.

1450
01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:42,610
Alright, let's move to- Alright guys, it's time.

1451
01:01:43,410 --> 01:01:44,230
Oh my gosh.

1452
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:46,690
We're time to kill off right side Doki.

1453
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:48,350
Say goodbye to her forever.

1454
01:01:48,930 --> 01:01:49,250
Goodbye.

1455
01:01:51,090 --> 01:01:53,130
Goodbye right side Doki.

1456
01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:56,110
Now it's left side Doki time.

1457
01:01:58,330 --> 01:02:01,530
There was- There can never be two Dokis.

1458
01:02:01,530 --> 01:02:03,450
Only one.

1459
01:02:04,670 --> 01:02:06,550
Oh my god, okay.

1460
01:02:06,910 --> 01:02:14,890
So like, it's so weird seeing them like- It's so weird seeing- Seeing them like this.

1461
01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:21,310
Like, the character designs were like- Oh my god, it's just so weird.

1462
01:02:23,090 --> 01:02:25,370
That was a long time ago.

1463
01:02:33,490 --> 01:02:36,950
That was so long ago, last year.

1464
01:02:40,730 --> 01:02:43,830
So long, anything could happen then.

1465
01:02:45,130 --> 01:02:47,290
Yeah, and they got real cult-y within a year.

1466
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:06,430
When officials turn to tyranny, it is a sign that imperial power is weakening.

1467
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:09,650
At such times, we must rise to the occasion.

1468
01:03:10,610 --> 01:03:11,730
I can- I can't.

1469
01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:17,650
Why is he- You're the same age, just- It's very stressful being on the ocean though.

1470
01:03:20,450 --> 01:03:22,290
They look so tired.

1471
01:03:22,610 --> 01:03:32,130
To be fair, I'm pretty sure Sun Jian's multiple wives and concubines might have like- Made him extra old.

1472
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:39,970
His multiple wives and concubines drained his life force.

1473
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:47,390
He has a lot of kids, guys!

1474
01:03:47,710 --> 01:03:50,130
He has a lot of children, okay?

1475
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:52,910
It makes sense when you think about it.

1476
01:03:53,190 --> 01:03:55,110
He has a lot of children.

1477
01:03:56,010 --> 01:03:59,050
And it sounds legit.

1478
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:03,470
Alright.

1479
01:04:03,770 --> 01:04:06,790
Oh my god, do I got any new superchats from ye olde dragoons?

1480
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:10,450
Uh...

1481
01:04:10,450 --> 01:04:15,330
Not Doki, I am a- Oh my god, Namus Volunteer, thank you for the superchat.

1482
01:04:15,430 --> 01:04:16,290
Thank you, thank you.

1483
01:04:16,390 --> 01:04:20,110
Not Doki, I am the Namus Volunteer soldier who previously sent you a letter.

1484
01:04:20,410 --> 01:04:22,190
I want to thank you for saving me again.

1485
01:04:22,190 --> 01:04:29,090
Most tend to be intimidated by the ferocity of major battles, but you charge across the battlefield without a hint of doubt.

1486
01:04:29,410 --> 01:04:34,910
I am thankful for that, since an enemy officer who was about to strike me down was sent flying by your attack.

1487
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:37,410
Which would be the second time.

1488
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:40,670
Understand that you were formerly a traveling warrior, which begs the question.

1489
01:04:40,930 --> 01:04:45,350
Are all warriors these days as strong as- Aw man, thank you ye olde dragoon.

1490
01:04:48,590 --> 01:04:49,970
Thank you for the superchat.

1491
01:04:50,050 --> 01:04:50,950
Thank you, thank you.

1492
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:53,030
Not Doki.

1493
01:04:55,070 --> 01:04:56,710
It's me from Puyang.

1494
01:04:57,270 --> 01:04:59,750
Man from Puyang, I totally remember you.

1495
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:01,150
Oh my god!

1496
01:05:01,610 --> 01:05:02,690
You saved me from attack.

1497
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:04,610
Oh my god, another dragoon!

1498
01:05:04,850 --> 01:05:07,810
Guys, we're building up a dragoon fanbase!

1499
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:09,150
2000 years ago!

1500
01:05:09,710 --> 01:05:12,890
You swooped in like a bird of prey and smashed through the ranks.

1501
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:16,930
I couldn't believe help would come to a place that even the government forces had abandoned.

1502
01:05:17,310 --> 01:05:19,310
All my fellow merchants speak highly of you.

1503
01:05:19,310 --> 01:05:22,630
Sorry, I don't mean to speculate or cause you any trouble, but I want to thank you.

1504
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:25,010
I will never forget how you saved my life.

1505
01:05:25,070 --> 01:05:27,930
Of course, anything for our fellow dragoon.

1506
01:05:28,170 --> 01:05:29,130
Don't worry.

1507
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:31,930
Ancient membership replies.

1508
01:05:36,190 --> 01:05:38,830
I saw a superchat that it's somebody's birthday.

1509
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:41,290
Nexy, thank you for the superchat.

1510
01:05:41,390 --> 01:05:42,110
Thank you, thank you.

1511
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:43,270
It was my birthday yesterday.

1512
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:47,090
Could get a happy birthday from my kami-oshi to make it birth- Of course, Nexy!

1513
01:05:47,090 --> 01:05:49,290
Happy birthday to you.

1514
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:51,210
Happy birthday to you.

1515
01:05:51,410 --> 01:05:53,150
Happy birthday, dear Nexy.

1516
01:05:53,610 --> 01:05:55,270
Happy birthday to you.

1517
01:05:55,330 --> 01:05:56,530
Yeah, happy birthday!

1518
01:05:57,330 --> 01:05:59,910
Alright, let's create more gems here.

1519
01:06:01,130 --> 01:06:02,510
And then...

1520
01:06:02,510 --> 01:06:03,910
Is there anything we can add?

1521
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:07,530
Oh, a boost health by 20%?

1522
01:06:07,870 --> 01:06:08,610
Fuck yeah.

1523
01:06:10,810 --> 01:06:13,090
I feel like health is more important, honestly.

1524
01:06:13,370 --> 01:06:14,070
Do I have more?

1525
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:17,070
Is there more...

1526
01:06:17,070 --> 01:06:18,170
Special attacks?

1527
01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:19,110
No, I think...

1528
01:06:19,110 --> 01:06:21,130
This whirlwind kick is...

1529
01:06:21,130 --> 01:06:24,210
Oh, it's for like dodging!

1530
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:25,390
Fucking who dodges?

1531
01:06:25,490 --> 01:06:26,310
I'm no coward.

1532
01:06:27,110 --> 01:06:28,090
I ain't no coward.

1533
01:06:28,410 --> 01:06:29,510
We don't need to dodge.

1534
01:06:30,450 --> 01:06:31,470
Um, what else?

1535
01:06:31,590 --> 01:06:33,490
Change clothing, battle preparation.

1536
01:06:33,810 --> 01:06:34,470
Alright, go out.

1537
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:38,010
My 200-year-old superchat.

1538
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:38,750
Oh, shit.

1539
01:06:39,150 --> 01:06:40,370
You're Hwang Guy.

1540
01:06:41,050 --> 01:06:41,690
Is that you?

1541
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:42,770
Where's your mohawk?

1542
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:48,300
He's just a man now.

1543
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:51,740
Why does he look so plain?

1544
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:56,540
You're just a man.

1545
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:06,140
Not Doki.

1546
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:08,960
He is?

1547
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:24,200
He kinda looks...

1548
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:26,100
He does, he looks so generic.

1549
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:31,860
Like...

1550
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:34,160
His armor doesn't even look...

1551
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:35,380
Show me your arms!

1552
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:36,880
Show me your biceps!

1553
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:39,360
You are a...

1554
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:40,660
You bomb things.

1555
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:47,840
Okay, I don't like that he's not showing his real body.

1556
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:52,660
He always shows his fucking biceps in all the iterations.

1557
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:56,940
He's supposed to be like this guy that just chucks bombs at people.

1558
01:07:57,340 --> 01:08:01,040
And I'm like, why are you hiding your most prized possession?

1559
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:02,740
You are a grappler.

1560
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:06,360
Why are you hiding your true weapon?

1561
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:10,240
When you cover it up, you're lowering your stats.

1562
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:13,080
Who covered his arms?

1563
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:17,460
Thank you for the magenta super.

1564
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:19,200
Thank you, thank you.

1565
01:08:20,220 --> 01:08:21,560
It's me from Puyo.

1566
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:23,480
Well, I suppose that doesn't tell you who I am.

1567
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:26,020
But you saved me from attacking yellow turbans.

1568
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:28,460
You swooped in like a bird of prey.

1569
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:31,120
Thank you for the magenta super.

1570
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:32,270
Thank you, thank you.

1571
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:37,320
Take it off!

1572
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:38,880
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1573
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:40,000
I should be more respectful.

1574
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:48,000
I should be more respectful.

1575
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:52,100
Don't you?

1576
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,780
Sorry, I wasn't processing the beginning of what he said.

1577
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:03,040
Because I was mad that he is too cloaked up.

1578
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:07,140
Thank you.

1579
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:09,240
Stop objectifying.

1580
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:19,980
Look at him!

1581
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:23,460
He's built like a fucking tank and he's covering it all up.

1582
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:24,840
What's the point?

1583
01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:31,960
What's the point of having a body like that?

1584
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:48,140
What?

1585
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:54,700
Oh, we're gonna win?

1586
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:56,280
Oh my god!

1587
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:57,340
Who would've thought?

1588
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:04,960
I cannot take Lu Bei seriously.

1589
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:08,280
I'm pretty sure they said people are saying that they age them up.

1590
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:09,020
The more you play.

1591
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:16,040
I cannot take K-pop Lu Bei seriously.

1592
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:16,820
I'm sorry.

1593
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,380
You're so mediocre Lu Bei.

1594
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:40,340
I'm sorry.

1595
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:42,600
He's always been mediocre.

1596
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:46,820
She was literally propped up by great generals and warriors.

1597
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:48,560
Led by a mediocre leader.

1598
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,920
That's right, I fucking said it.

1599
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:52,620
That's right.

1600
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:56,960
No romanticizing can change my opinion.

1601
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:02,140
Yeah, that's me.

1602
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:07,740
Yeah, I'm doing it!

1603
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:14,520
He's basically a really good politician.

1604
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:24,100
Oh my god, get a horse!

1605
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:27,600
Oh my god, this is my horse!

1606
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:28,340
Let's go!

1607
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:32,660
Okay, I can call upon my left analog stick.

1608
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:33,760
Let's go.

1609
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:34,960
This is my horse.

1610
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:36,560
Isn't he perfect?

1611
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:38,140
Give it a lick.

1612
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:40,420
I'm sorry.

1613
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:43,740
Let's see.

1614
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:49,100
Is there like a store?

1615
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:54,120
Let's help these guys so I can level up.

1616
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:56,140
Reride.

1617
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:57,080
Reride.

1618
01:11:59,910 --> 01:12:02,640
That's Doki Amber Doge, but as a horse.

1619
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:04,820
Can I just do this?

1620
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,740
Wait, I can't fight on the horse?

1621
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:09,220
Oh!

1622
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:11,840
Wait, okay, mounted attack.

1623
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,520
Oh, they don't have it!

1624
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:15,620
Okay, sorry.

1625
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:18,180
I'm looking at the ride like a win.

1626
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,460
Jump, block, mounted attack.

1627
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:22,600
Oh, they don't have...

1628
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:24,220
Okay, for those who don't know.

1629
01:12:24,220 --> 01:12:25,540
In Dynasty Warriors.

1630
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,980
In the old Dynasty Warriors.

1631
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:29,900
They have a thing.

1632
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:31,700
Where you can just fight on the horse.

1633
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:33,280
So like...

1634
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,400
Get over here, horse.

1635
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:36,840
I can't do it.

1636
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:39,440
It would be easier to fight on the horse.

1637
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:40,520
But they don't have it.

1638
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:43,340
Doki...

1639
01:12:43,340 --> 01:12:46,100
Yeah, that's the Doki Amber horse.

1640
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:46,760
Yeah!

1641
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,240
Yeah, they removed it!

1642
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,200
They have charge though.

1643
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:54,880
They removed the horse.

1644
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,120
Yeah, the horse strafing.

1645
01:12:56,220 --> 01:12:57,560
I missed the horse strafing.

1646
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:58,980
It was so easy.

1647
01:13:01,820 --> 01:13:02,440
Yeah.

1648
01:13:02,780 --> 01:13:03,460
My da.

1649
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:06,020
Come over here, Doki Amber horse!

1650
01:13:06,820 --> 01:13:08,000
Get over here!

1651
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:11,660
I'm not gonna...

1652
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:13,860
I'm not gonna use the horse attack.

1653
01:13:14,180 --> 01:13:16,060
Attacking on the horse seems like...

1654
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:17,780
Really too much.

1655
01:13:17,780 --> 01:13:18,420
Hahaha!

1656
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:23,460
I just do that.

1657
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:25,740
Oh!

1658
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:29,040
Don't make me burn your fucking house down!

1659
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:35,140
Oh shit!

1660
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:36,400
I was not paying attention.

1661
01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:38,140
Oh my god, please!

1662
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:40,560
There's too many!

1663
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:41,740
That's it.

1664
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:45,260
I'm gonna burn somebody's house down.

1665
01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:45,440
Oh my god.

1666
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:49,060
I was facing the wrong direction.

1667
01:13:49,940 --> 01:13:51,020
That's alright, I can kill him here.

1668
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:52,680
No?

1669
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:54,020
I don't kill him here?

1670
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:56,180
It's fine, I can kill him here.

1671
01:13:58,080 --> 01:13:58,520
Jesus!

1672
01:13:58,720 --> 01:13:59,580
Okay, give me a sec.

1673
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:00,140
Where are you?

1674
01:14:00,940 --> 01:14:01,380
Hahaha!

1675
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:03,200
Give me a sec.

1676
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:08,920
I'm gonna make sure everybody's widowed after I'm done with all of you.

1677
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:10,400
I don't care.

1678
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:11,680
Hahaha!

1679
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:12,160
Hahaha!

1680
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:14,820
None of you will have families.

1681
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:16,720
That's right.

1682
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:19,820
I'm gonna fucking charge in here too.

1683
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:21,160
Oh my god.

1684
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:22,520
The horse is so weak.

1685
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:25,360
Alright, you tell them what I did.

1686
01:14:25,740 --> 01:14:26,360
Hahaha!

1687
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:27,820
Bro.

1688
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:29,520
Hahaha!

1689
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:33,880
Alright, I'm back.

1690
01:14:35,420 --> 01:14:37,780
Now you have no one to help you.

1691
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:39,280
That's fucking right.

1692
01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:42,100
That's fucking right.

1693
01:14:42,340 --> 01:14:43,420
Oh, you wanna do that again?

1694
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:44,580
Oh, what you gonna do?

1695
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:46,360
You lost your fucking arrows.

1696
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:48,540
What the fuck are you gonna do?

1697
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:49,600
Nothing!

1698
01:14:50,540 --> 01:14:52,500
You lost your range attack.

1699
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:54,740
Oh, whoops.

1700
01:14:54,940 --> 01:14:55,760
I thought he was dead.

1701
01:14:59,080 --> 01:14:59,600
Yeah!

1702
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:04,000
I missed the horse strafing.

1703
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:06,560
I didn't know horse strafing was...

1704
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:07,600
Oh my god.

1705
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:11,720
Like, what's the point of attacking on the horse if you can't strafe on the horse?

1706
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:17,440
Alright, let's get...

1707
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,540
Can I... Enables you to evade repeatedly?

1708
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:21,320
Chain evasion?

1709
01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:22,120
Is it this?

1710
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:24,680
What's chain evasion though?

1711
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:26,680
Oh, we need more meat buns.

1712
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:30,140
Maybe.

1713
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:31,600
Do you think I can lock on?

1714
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:32,740
I can try that.

1715
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:37,000
Uh...

1716
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,260
Where do I have to go?

1717
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:40,900
Oh wait, there's another area here.

1718
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:43,380
I don't know if this is...

1719
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:45,500
If doing the bandit stuff is worth it.

1720
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:49,060
I guess it like, levels you up.

1721
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:52,880
I'll do one more, but I don't know if it's actually worth it or a waste of time.

1722
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:57,260
Oh, I can double dodge?

1723
01:15:58,560 --> 01:15:59,100
Okay, wait.

1724
01:15:59,160 --> 01:15:59,920
I forgot how to dodge.

1725
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:00,460
Oh, this.

1726
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:03,660
Are you serious?

1727
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:05,260
Okay, this.

1728
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:06,160
That's it.

1729
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,360
Alright, it's just an XP farm?

1730
01:16:17,620 --> 01:16:18,740
Oh, it does nothing?

1731
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,180
Okay, I'll stop doing them.

1732
01:16:20,420 --> 01:16:23,540
I don't know if it's like, an actual...

1733
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,500
Like, if it's actually good or not.

1734
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:27,420
Doing these.

1735
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:29,460
I guess I don't really...

1736
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:30,020
Oh, fuck.

1737
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:32,420
Ah, get over here!

1738
01:16:32,940 --> 01:16:33,280
Alright.

1739
01:16:36,460 --> 01:16:36,980
Freedom!

1740
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:38,900
Freedom!

1741
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:43,360
It's kind of a waste?

1742
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:43,960
Yeah, alright.

1743
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:46,140
I'll stop doing the bandit stuff.

1744
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:48,440
I love the ego sound so much.

1745
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:49,240
It's so silly.

1746
01:16:49,580 --> 01:16:51,680
It's actually so fucking silly.

1747
01:16:57,500 --> 01:17:02,770
I can listen to that fucking forever.

1748
01:17:02,770 --> 01:17:02,870
I can listen to that forever.

1749
01:17:06,690 --> 01:17:07,770
Alright, nice.

1750
01:17:09,670 --> 01:17:10,690
Jesus Christ.

1751
01:17:10,850 --> 01:17:11,710
Get out of here.

1752
01:17:13,090 --> 01:17:14,630
Okay, we gotta get rid of this guy.

1753
01:17:14,850 --> 01:17:16,630
Is he the biggest guy out here?

1754
01:17:17,270 --> 01:17:19,230
I'm gonna kill the biggest guy out here.

1755
01:17:19,310 --> 01:17:20,870
So it's all just short kings.

1756
01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:24,810
Only short kings allowed in ancient China.

1757
01:17:25,770 --> 01:17:26,750
That's fucking right.

1758
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:28,290
I'm rewriting history.

1759
01:17:30,550 --> 01:17:31,410
Oh, whoops.

1760
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:32,170
Wrong attack.

1761
01:17:32,790 --> 01:17:34,070
I mean, it still works though.

1762
01:17:37,770 --> 01:17:38,330
Nice.

1763
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:40,450
That's right, get parried.

1764
01:17:41,070 --> 01:17:41,890
Oh, no.

1765
01:17:42,310 --> 01:17:43,710
That's right, I'm doing it for you guys.

1766
01:17:44,110 --> 01:17:46,630
I'm doing it for all the short kings in this world!

1767
01:17:48,890 --> 01:17:49,810
That's right.

1768
01:17:50,410 --> 01:17:52,750
How dare they try to...

1769
01:17:52,750 --> 01:17:53,470
What's the word?

1770
01:17:55,090 --> 01:17:55,650
Discriminate?

1771
01:17:55,650 --> 01:17:56,530
Where like, they only...

1772
01:17:56,530 --> 01:17:58,870
They only employ certain groups of people.

1773
01:17:59,370 --> 01:18:02,070
And like, they won't employ other groups of people.

1774
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:03,730
Because they're like, you're not tall enough.

1775
01:18:03,810 --> 01:18:04,910
Or shit, something like that.

1776
01:18:05,190 --> 01:18:06,070
What's that word called?

1777
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:09,310
Discriminate.

1778
01:18:09,370 --> 01:18:12,730
HOW DARE YOU DISCRIMINATE AMONGST MY SHORT KINGS!

1779
01:18:13,270 --> 01:18:15,390
I'm here to fight for them!

1780
01:18:15,570 --> 01:18:16,890
As a fellow short king.

1781
01:18:17,550 --> 01:18:18,990
That's fucking right.

1782
01:18:19,590 --> 01:18:21,070
How dare you!

1783
01:18:21,070 --> 01:18:24,550
Other short kings can be generals too!

1784
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:29,770
That's fucking right.

1785
01:18:31,470 --> 01:18:32,510
That's right.

1786
01:18:33,010 --> 01:18:35,350
And Chow Chow can be a general at 5'3".

1787
01:18:35,870 --> 01:18:38,150
Anything can be possible.

1788
01:18:39,430 --> 01:18:40,830
That's fucking right.

1789
01:18:41,910 --> 01:18:43,230
For short kings everywhere.

1790
01:18:43,790 --> 01:18:44,810
I do it for you.

1791
01:18:46,370 --> 01:18:49,290
She's qualified to fight for us.

1792
01:18:54,290 --> 01:18:55,090
That's right.

1793
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:01,640
Alright, let's see.

1794
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:03,060
Defeat a hundred foes with...

1795
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:04,360
Oh, I need to use a sword?

1796
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:05,980
But what if I don't?

1797
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:08,120
What if I don't use a sword?

1798
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:10,060
Uh...

1799
01:19:10,060 --> 01:19:10,900
Oh wait, what's this?

1800
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:13,280
Xiaohu Yuan?

1801
01:19:13,660 --> 01:19:14,540
Did I do it?

1802
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:18,600
Hello, Xiaohu Yuan.

1803
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:22,760
What do you want to talk about?

1804
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:26,360
Hey!

1805
01:19:32,980 --> 01:19:33,460
Uh...

1806
01:19:33,460 --> 01:19:35,180
What can I do for you?

1807
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:36,160
Yeah, what do you want?

1808
01:19:40,820 --> 01:19:43,660
Okay, his voice does not fit his fucking face.

1809
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:48,740
Yeah, why did you come to see me?

1810
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:50,880
I saw something in you.

1811
01:19:51,180 --> 01:19:54,580
Which is why I wanted to meet face to face again.

1812
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:57,420
Me?

1813
01:19:57,420 --> 01:19:57,920
Uh...

1814
01:19:57,920 --> 01:19:59,040
What would that be?

1815
01:19:59,180 --> 01:20:00,020
You know what I mean.

1816
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:04,000
After seeing your feats in battle, I have no doubt of your potential.

1817
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:07,540
Lord Cao Cao and Dun liked what you did.

1818
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:09,580
They're not the type to show it.

1819
01:20:09,860 --> 01:20:11,300
But they can't fool me.

1820
01:20:11,780 --> 01:20:14,660
And if those two take a liking to you...

1821
01:20:14,660 --> 01:20:15,880
That means you're the real deal.

1822
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:16,440
That's right.

1823
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:18,020
I'm going to be famous.

1824
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:20,720
And people are going to write about me for generations.

1825
01:20:21,980 --> 01:20:23,440
Media not doki.

1826
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:28,440
In that case...

1827
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:36,700
I will be one of the main characters.

1828
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:40,400
Within the story of the three kingdoms.

1829
01:20:40,820 --> 01:20:43,600
I will surely be written in history books.

1830
01:20:43,740 --> 01:20:44,620
Right, guys?

1831
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:47,620
You're not going to delete me.

1832
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:50,320
Right, guys?

1833
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:53,260
Okay, nice.

1834
01:20:58,860 --> 01:21:01,040
I'll never be forgotten.

1835
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:02,560
I can feel it.

1836
01:21:08,180 --> 01:21:09,500
Oh, there it is.

1837
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:12,660
I'm going to take this gem.

1838
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:14,540
And then...

1839
01:21:14,540 --> 01:21:16,260
We should go...

1840
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:18,080
Hello, generic quest giver voice man.

1841
01:21:18,180 --> 01:21:19,180
What is my quest now?

1842
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:20,980
Thank you for the super chat.

1843
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:23,780
Wait, what is my mission?

1844
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:26,440
Wait a minute.

1845
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:27,820
I actually don't know.

1846
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:32,400
No, we're not that...

1847
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:33,380
Wait, did I not finish?

1848
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:34,680
Oh wait, I did.

1849
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:40,180
Oh, I have to go back to G.

1850
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:42,120
I have to go back all the way back here?

1851
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:45,720
Where?

1852
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:50,300
Oh my God, I have to go all the way back.

1853
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:54,340
Alright, I just want to make sure...

1854
01:21:54,340 --> 01:21:55,900
I got everything done around here.

1855
01:21:58,520 --> 01:21:58,920
Okay.

1856
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:00,540
Oh wait, I haven't talked to him before.

1857
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:02,800
Yeah, but I want to travel back...

1858
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:03,980
To see if there's anything I missed.

1859
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:06,980
I want to do all the side quests...

1860
01:22:06,980 --> 01:22:08,060
And like...

1861
01:22:08,060 --> 01:22:10,060
Go through all the dating routes.

1862
01:22:15,220 --> 01:22:16,480
Oh my God.

1863
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:18,020
What's my next route?

1864
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:20,140
What's the next date route?

1865
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:25,160
Oh shit.

1866
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:29,980
Oh my God.

1867
01:22:30,020 --> 01:22:32,480
Who's going to be my next option?

1868
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:33,860
Oh my God.

1869
01:22:36,220 --> 01:22:37,460
It's called...

1870
01:22:37,460 --> 01:22:39,740
Romance of the Three Kingdoms, guys.

1871
01:22:39,740 --> 01:22:40,000
Yes?

1872
01:22:43,180 --> 01:22:45,260
Oh hello, Mr. Dang.

1873
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:47,540
Oh, Mr. Hong.

1874
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:48,980
Sorry, it's first name Hong.

1875
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:50,800
Hello, Mr. Han.

1876
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:52,620
How you doing, Han?

1877
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:56,620
Yes?

1878
01:23:13,340 --> 01:23:13,940
Woah.

1879
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:15,880
Of course.

1880
01:23:27,380 --> 01:23:27,980
Woah.

1881
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:29,280
You want to chat?

1882
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:32,140
Oh my God, we're getting the first base already.

1883
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:33,140
Oh my God.

1884
01:23:33,220 --> 01:23:35,400
Let me unbutton one button real quick.

1885
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:39,080
Oh my God.

1886
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:40,560
You were with the burly men.

1887
01:23:40,700 --> 01:23:42,820
You didn't stand out much.

1888
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:45,000
You didn't...

1889
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,860
Why is he flirting?

1890
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:47,760
Oh my God.

1891
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:50,560
Okay, do I play hard to get, guys?

1892
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:51,680
Or like...

1893
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:55,000
Do I talk about the burly men that was next to him?

1894
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:57,400
Do I...

1895
01:23:59,110 --> 01:23:59,900
I'm like...

1896
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:03,380
Oh yeah, I noticed you amongst those other burly men.

1897
01:24:11,510 --> 01:24:12,390
Hahaha.

1898
01:24:16,610 --> 01:24:22,110
Oh my God.

1899
01:24:22,290 --> 01:24:24,890
He has low self-esteem.

1900
01:24:25,070 --> 01:24:25,770
It's perfect.

1901
01:24:32,070 --> 01:24:34,950
He has low self-esteem.

1902
01:24:34,950 --> 01:24:36,910
He's gonna be so easy.

1903
01:24:39,290 --> 01:24:40,330
Easy target.

1904
01:24:42,390 --> 01:24:45,030
He will have very low expectations, guys.

1905
01:24:45,170 --> 01:24:46,130
I can do anything.

1906
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:49,590
I can do anything and he'll think it's like...

1907
01:24:49,590 --> 01:24:51,210
He'll think that like...

1908
01:24:51,210 --> 01:24:52,890
He'll think it's like the world.

1909
01:24:55,070 --> 01:24:56,750
Alright, maybe just order again.

1910
01:24:56,990 --> 01:24:58,870
Can you believe my order still hasn't come?

1911
01:24:58,990 --> 01:25:00,610
I made it so long ago.

1912
01:25:01,590 --> 01:25:03,090
Maybe they forgot it.

1913
01:25:04,950 --> 01:25:05,490
Why don't you?

1914
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:08,690
Though I'd wager that you're right.

1915
01:25:10,870 --> 01:25:15,610
Why are all my dialogue options makes him feel more shit about himself?

1916
01:25:15,950 --> 01:25:18,310
Like, I'm trying to be nice.

1917
01:25:21,610 --> 01:25:23,970
No, don't say that, Hong Dong.

1918
01:25:26,190 --> 01:25:27,890
Don't say that.

1919
01:25:31,270 --> 01:25:33,170
What, being forgetful?

1920
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:35,410
That's so fucked up.

1921
01:25:37,110 --> 01:25:38,750
Oh my god.

1922
01:25:38,770 --> 01:25:42,870
Bro, your leader literally says you're forgetful and that's a skill?

1923
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:47,710
Not standing out is a skill.

1924
01:25:50,210 --> 01:25:53,450
It means you haven't failed.

1925
01:25:53,450 --> 01:25:54,390
Oh my god.

1926
01:25:54,970 --> 01:25:55,510
Okay.

1927
01:26:00,130 --> 01:26:03,110
I actually really wanted to say the second option.

1928
01:26:07,130 --> 01:26:07,670
Yeah.

1929
01:26:11,690 --> 01:26:12,110
Oh my god.

1930
01:26:12,410 --> 01:26:14,430
I got plus one in dialogue option.

1931
01:26:14,870 --> 01:26:15,710
I got plus one heart.

1932
01:26:16,890 --> 01:26:17,830
I did it.

1933
01:26:25,210 --> 01:26:25,730
Nice.

1934
01:26:26,030 --> 01:26:26,790
I'm so in.

1935
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:27,590
Plus one heart.

1936
01:26:28,190 --> 01:26:29,150
It worked, guys.

1937
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:31,570
I did it.

1938
01:26:32,090 --> 01:26:33,230
I gave him therapy.

1939
01:26:33,330 --> 01:26:33,850
I fixed it.

1940
01:26:33,890 --> 01:26:34,410
I told you.

1941
01:26:34,630 --> 01:26:35,290
That's it?

1942
01:26:35,350 --> 01:26:36,890
That's literally...

1943
01:26:36,890 --> 01:26:38,970
It felt like...

1944
01:26:38,970 --> 01:26:40,490
It actually felt like a...

1945
01:26:41,430 --> 01:26:44,110
It felt like a dating simulator right there.

1946
01:26:44,170 --> 01:26:46,070
I just got the Hong Dong route right there.

1947
01:26:46,330 --> 01:26:48,590
Are we doing a dating simulator now?

1948
01:26:49,630 --> 01:26:51,810
CBMiracle, thank you for the super chat.

1949
01:26:51,810 --> 01:26:53,190
Thank you, thank you.

1950
01:26:53,310 --> 01:26:56,010
Wait, this is actually a dating...

1951
01:26:56,010 --> 01:26:58,490
This is actually like the dating route.

1952
01:26:59,210 --> 01:27:00,790
The Hong Dong route.

1953
01:27:04,010 --> 01:27:05,050
It kind of is.

1954
01:27:05,110 --> 01:27:05,570
Hey, guys.

1955
01:27:05,730 --> 01:27:06,970
Romance of the three kingdoms.

1956
01:27:08,250 --> 01:27:10,350
Thank you for the very first super chat.

1957
01:27:10,470 --> 01:27:11,350
Thank you, thank you.

1958
01:27:11,430 --> 01:27:14,190
As a short king myself, I appreciate you representing us.

1959
01:27:14,470 --> 01:27:17,250
Take this as my first ever super chat to a VTuber.

1960
01:27:17,610 --> 01:27:19,290
May the short kings conquer the internet.

1961
01:27:19,470 --> 01:27:21,210
I shall unite the free kingdoms.

1962
01:27:21,210 --> 01:27:23,470
For all short kings out there.

1963
01:27:27,290 --> 01:27:29,250
This is a special train...

1964
01:27:29,250 --> 01:27:30,110
Oh my god, guys.

1965
01:27:30,150 --> 01:27:32,030
He's gonna give me special training, guys.

1966
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:35,150
Oh my god.

1967
01:27:36,830 --> 01:27:38,490
Think of me when...

1968
01:27:38,490 --> 01:27:40,110
Oh my god.

1969
01:27:40,210 --> 01:27:43,390
Think of me whenever you use it.

1970
01:27:43,670 --> 01:27:45,870
I imagine you won't forget me then.

1971
01:27:46,170 --> 01:27:48,570
Not even if you wanted to.

1972
01:27:48,570 --> 01:27:50,410
Oh my god.

1973
01:27:50,870 --> 01:27:51,870
Oh my god.

1974
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:03,710
I imagine that.

1975
01:28:04,350 --> 01:28:07,770
Not even if you wanted me to.

1976
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:10,610
Bro.

1977
01:28:11,510 --> 01:28:13,210
Oh my god.

1978
01:28:14,410 --> 01:28:15,210
Bro.

1979
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:19,890
It's not even subtle.

1980
01:28:20,650 --> 01:28:23,730
Oh, we ain't forgetting that.

1981
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:35,760
Yeah, I am.

1982
01:28:35,980 --> 01:28:38,920
Sorry, I was a little distracted with the side routes.

1983
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:40,580
Oh my god.

1984
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:41,420
Wait, is that him?

1985
01:28:49,340 --> 01:28:51,580
Wait, he sounds like that?

1986
01:28:51,580 --> 01:28:52,000
What?

1987
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:04,560
What?

1988
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:11,940
That's Dong Zhuo.

1989
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:18,620
I thought he has like a pin nose.

1990
01:29:18,620 --> 01:29:20,280
It was described!

1991
01:29:44,620 --> 01:29:47,540
I'm like speechless right now.

1992
01:29:47,540 --> 01:29:49,440
I don't know what to say.

1993
01:29:51,410 --> 01:29:51,800
I...

1994
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:54,660
I don't know what to say.

1995
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:04,700
I don't know what to say.

1996
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:12,680
Oh my... What?

1997
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:13,000
I...

1998
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:13,500
I...

1999
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:16,900
I'm speechless.

2000
01:30:18,490 --> 01:30:20,020
Oh my god.

2001
01:30:20,450 --> 01:30:20,880
I...

2002
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:24,640
I don't know what to say after seeing that.

2003
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:26,280
Oh, I...

2004
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:27,180
I...

2005
01:30:27,180 --> 01:30:30,560
I just...

2006
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:31,920
Alright, so...

2007
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:34,480
For those who wanna know...

2008
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:35,940
For those who are like...

2009
01:30:35,940 --> 01:30:37,500
What are you seeing, Doki?

2010
01:30:37,660 --> 01:30:39,400
He doesn't look that...

2011
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:40,460
Okay, okay.

2012
01:30:40,580 --> 01:30:41,520
For those who are like...

2013
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:43,380
I don't understand, Doki.

2014
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:45,520
He doesn't look that hot.

2015
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:47,180
Okay, but like...

2016
01:30:47,180 --> 01:30:48,920
You have to know...

2017
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:50,980
Where we came from.

2018
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:53,260
The character designs...

2019
01:30:53,260 --> 01:30:55,340
That we all grew up with.

2020
01:30:55,880 --> 01:30:57,800
And that's been like...

2021
01:30:57,800 --> 01:30:58,620
That's...

2022
01:30:59,260 --> 01:31:00,960
That we've had to like...

2023
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:02,780
Look at for...

2024
01:31:02,780 --> 01:31:04,740
For nine games.

2025
01:31:05,060 --> 01:31:07,200
And like, when you see it...

2026
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:09,540
You'd understand why we're reacting like that.

2027
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:10,560
I...

2028
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:12,080
I legitimately...

2029
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:13,540
I'm speechless.

2030
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:14,620
I...

2031
01:31:20,660 --> 01:31:21,660
I...

2032
01:31:21,660 --> 01:31:21,760
I...

2033
01:31:23,180 --> 01:31:24,820
I'm speechless.

2034
01:31:27,140 --> 01:31:28,920
I was...

2035
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:30,560
I'm not...

2036
01:31:30,820 --> 01:31:33,620
I'm not used to this at all.

2037
01:31:33,900 --> 01:31:35,180
And then...

2038
01:31:35,180 --> 01:31:35,660
And...

2039
01:31:35,660 --> 01:31:36,920
Bro!

2040
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:39,940
The glow up!

2041
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:40,680
And then...

2042
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:42,080
Okay, so...

2043
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:44,760
I'll show you a different design of him.

2044
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:45,900
But it's still...

2045
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:47,780
It's basically the same thing.

2046
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:50,220
So like...

2047
01:31:50,220 --> 01:31:52,240
You know, like...

2048
01:31:53,540 --> 01:31:54,260
It's...

2049
01:31:55,180 --> 01:31:55,560
I'm...

2050
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:00,360
And...

2051
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:02,900
Yeah, so like...

2052
01:32:02,900 --> 01:32:04,900
I'm not...

2053
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:06,420
I don't know what to say.

2054
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:07,560
I...

2055
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:10,500
I don't know what to say.

2056
01:32:11,580 --> 01:32:13,380
How the years...

2057
01:32:13,380 --> 01:32:14,440
Changed him.

2058
01:32:14,860 --> 01:32:15,620
Like...

2059
01:32:15,620 --> 01:32:18,380
He looks like that now.

2060
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:19,380
Like he...

2061
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:22,840
He looks like...

2062
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:23,620
That now.

2063
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:26,940
Like I don't have words.

2064
01:32:27,100 --> 01:32:28,360
At what I've just saw.

2065
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:30,900
I don't have words that can...

2066
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:33,560
Describe how I feel right now.

2067
01:32:33,660 --> 01:32:34,900
Because it's...

2068
01:32:36,220 --> 01:32:40,140
He looks

2069
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:50,780
like a person now.

2070
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:52,980
He looks like a person now.

2071
01:32:54,780 --> 01:32:56,420
Oh my god.

2072
01:33:01,540 --> 01:33:02,340
It's...

2073
01:33:02,340 --> 01:33:04,520
Bro like...

2074
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:05,680
Oh my god.

2075
01:33:06,820 --> 01:33:07,860
Bro got some ozone.

2076
01:33:08,620 --> 01:33:09,440
What is that?

2077
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:13,540
He changed his life around.

2078
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:14,500
That's for sure.

2079
01:33:14,620 --> 01:33:16,720
He actually changed his life around.

2080
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:17,840
Bro's drinking.

2081
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:20,180
Bro went to that fucking gym.

2082
01:33:20,460 --> 01:33:22,600
He actually did.

2083
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:24,240
Holy...

2084
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:26,760
My mind is not processing this...

2085
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:28,220
Very well right now.

2086
01:33:28,260 --> 01:33:30,400
I'm actually not processing it very well.

2087
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:30,980
I...

2088
01:33:30,980 --> 01:33:33,240
Everything is like broke me.

2089
01:33:33,820 --> 01:33:36,120
It has all broke me up.

2090
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:37,680
Alright.

2091
01:33:38,180 --> 01:33:39,500
Salting the base.

2092
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:40,680
The yellow turbans.

2093
01:33:40,860 --> 01:33:42,100
Oh I want the armor.

2094
01:33:43,940 --> 01:33:45,620
He actually has legs now.

2095
01:33:45,700 --> 01:33:47,280
He can actually walk now.

2096
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:55,450
Oh my god.

2097
01:33:55,650 --> 01:33:57,130
Everything like...

2098
01:33:57,130 --> 01:33:58,870
Changed for me.

2099
01:33:59,890 --> 01:34:00,650
Like...

2100
01:34:00,650 --> 01:34:03,350
I think Donja has to be the craziest.

2101
01:34:03,350 --> 01:34:04,170
Like...

2102
01:34:04,170 --> 01:34:07,850
You spoiled his final part.

2103
01:34:08,250 --> 01:34:10,450
Thank you for the super chat.

2104
01:34:10,750 --> 01:34:10,970
Thank you.

2105
01:34:12,250 --> 01:34:13,030
Like...

2106
01:34:13,030 --> 01:34:15,150
I just...

2107
01:34:15,150 --> 01:34:16,910
I can't process this.

2108
01:34:17,010 --> 01:34:20,610
My mind is still stuck on the fact that I just saw...

2109
01:34:20,610 --> 01:34:22,450
Handsome Don...

2110
01:34:22,450 --> 01:34:23,550
In the books...

2111
01:34:23,550 --> 01:34:26,050
He is described as a fucking pig.

2112
01:34:26,230 --> 01:34:26,590
Like...

2113
01:34:26,590 --> 01:34:28,530
He is actually...

2114
01:34:28,530 --> 01:34:31,390
The book was not kind to him.

2115
01:34:32,230 --> 01:34:33,710
He was...

2116
01:34:33,710 --> 01:34:35,170
Described as like...

2117
01:34:35,170 --> 01:34:37,610
Like a pig and like...

2118
01:34:37,610 --> 01:34:39,810
One of the ugliest guys in...

2119
01:34:39,810 --> 01:34:40,610
In...

2120
01:34:41,390 --> 01:34:42,430
In the...

2121
01:34:42,430 --> 01:34:44,110
In ancient China.

2122
01:34:44,430 --> 01:34:46,110
And very, very fat.

2123
01:34:46,290 --> 01:34:47,830
So just seeing him like this.

2124
01:34:47,910 --> 01:34:48,670
I'm like...

2125
01:34:48,670 --> 01:34:49,670
Who are you?

2126
01:34:57,290 --> 01:34:58,810
The slander.

2127
01:34:58,810 --> 01:34:59,970
They were just jealous.

2128
01:35:00,030 --> 01:35:00,430
You're right.

2129
01:35:00,550 --> 01:35:03,090
They were just incredibly jealous of him.

2130
01:35:03,350 --> 01:35:04,530
You're so right, guys.

2131
01:35:04,770 --> 01:35:06,470
It was all pure slander.

2132
01:35:07,550 --> 01:35:08,110
Propaganda.

2133
01:35:08,710 --> 01:35:09,950
For the Shu Kingdom.

2134
01:35:12,150 --> 01:35:13,650
You're so right, guys.

2135
01:35:14,510 --> 01:35:15,530
How dare he.

2136
01:35:17,170 --> 01:35:18,930
He has to fight him.

2137
01:35:20,330 --> 01:35:20,910
It's just...

2138
01:35:20,910 --> 01:35:22,650
It's just incredibly weird.

2139
01:35:22,810 --> 01:35:24,170
My head is just thinking...

2140
01:35:24,170 --> 01:35:25,910
My head is still thinking about it.

2141
01:35:25,910 --> 01:35:27,730
I'm not used to it.

2142
01:35:27,750 --> 01:35:30,850
I'm stuck in this loop of...

2143
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:31,910
He's high now.

2144
01:35:32,110 --> 01:35:32,890
What happened?

2145
01:35:36,730 --> 01:35:38,170
Devs accidentally...

2146
01:35:38,650 --> 01:35:40,170
Just make...

2147
01:35:40,170 --> 01:35:42,110
If they're all handsome...

2148
01:35:42,110 --> 01:35:43,910
Then like...

2149
01:35:44,530 --> 01:35:46,090
Then nobody is handsome.

2150
01:35:51,870 --> 01:35:54,290
They're all jealous...

2151
01:35:54,290 --> 01:35:55,450
Of the big dog.

2152
01:35:58,970 --> 01:36:00,830
Oh my god.

2153
01:36:01,310 --> 01:36:03,290
I'm still thinking about it.

2154
01:36:04,130 --> 01:36:04,810
Guys.

2155
01:36:05,090 --> 01:36:06,670
I'm still thinking about it.

2156
01:36:07,590 --> 01:36:08,950
It's so weird.

2157
01:36:09,130 --> 01:36:10,190
Because it's been...

2158
01:36:10,190 --> 01:36:14,450
20 years of seeing...

2159
01:36:14,450 --> 01:36:15,870
Ugly Dong Zhuo.

2160
01:36:16,450 --> 01:36:18,770
I'm gonna fucking butcher his name every time.

2161
01:36:18,830 --> 01:36:19,590
Because I never...

2162
01:36:19,590 --> 01:36:20,810
I hated him as a character.

2163
01:36:20,810 --> 01:36:22,550
I hate him as a character.

2164
01:36:22,690 --> 01:36:23,610
And I hated...

2165
01:36:23,610 --> 01:36:25,770
I just hated everything about him.

2166
01:36:25,810 --> 01:36:27,410
So I never see him as relevant.

2167
01:36:27,950 --> 01:36:29,490
And now that he's handsome...

2168
01:36:29,490 --> 01:36:30,490
It's just...

2169
01:36:30,490 --> 01:36:32,890
My mind can't sync up to that.

2170
01:36:33,270 --> 01:36:34,850
It's breaking my mind.

2171
01:36:38,810 --> 01:36:40,010
It's actually...

2172
01:36:40,870 --> 01:36:42,070
It's breaking...

2173
01:36:42,070 --> 01:36:44,490
My entire concept of this game now.

2174
01:36:44,730 --> 01:36:46,350
And all I can think about is...

2175
01:36:46,350 --> 01:36:47,590
Why is he handsome?

2176
01:36:47,590 --> 01:36:48,730
Like...

2177
01:36:49,230 --> 01:36:51,130
It's breaking my world view.

2178
01:36:51,330 --> 01:36:53,370
My entire world view is gone.

2179
01:36:53,730 --> 01:36:54,190
Like...

2180
01:36:54,190 --> 01:36:56,950
How is that possible?

2181
01:36:59,910 --> 01:37:01,910
He's supposed to be like...

2182
01:37:04,450 --> 01:37:07,470
He's never was supposed to be attractive.

2183
01:37:07,910 --> 01:37:09,710
So why is he attractive?

2184
01:37:11,790 --> 01:37:13,450
Han Zhuo broke.

2185
01:37:17,590 --> 01:37:19,130
Why is this...

2186
01:37:19,130 --> 01:37:21,650
Why is he misunderstood now?

2187
01:37:23,330 --> 01:37:27,830
He was supposed to be known as one of the worst people in ancient China.

2188
01:37:28,350 --> 01:37:30,930
But now he's just misunderstood?

2189
01:37:31,530 --> 01:37:33,330
Oh my god, no.

2190
01:37:33,790 --> 01:37:35,750
Now he has character depth?

2191
01:37:35,850 --> 01:37:37,810
You mean he's not a cartoon villain?

2192
01:37:38,170 --> 01:37:39,790
That was known to commit atrocity?

2193
01:37:40,510 --> 01:37:41,490
And then like...

2194
01:37:41,490 --> 01:37:43,030
To be fair...

2195
01:37:43,030 --> 01:37:45,470
His fucking wife cheated on him with Lu Bu.

2196
01:37:45,470 --> 01:37:46,990
So like honestly...

2197
01:37:46,990 --> 01:37:47,590
But like...

2198
01:37:47,590 --> 01:37:51,690
We've been told for history...

2199
01:37:51,690 --> 01:37:53,830
For years that like...

2200
01:37:53,830 --> 01:37:55,530
His wife did it because...

2201
01:37:55,530 --> 01:37:57,210
He was a very bad husband.

2202
01:37:57,690 --> 01:37:59,130
But like...

2203
01:37:59,130 --> 01:38:01,390
But like...

2204
01:38:01,390 --> 01:38:02,690
Oh my god.

2205
01:38:03,970 --> 01:38:05,290
But he...

2206
01:38:05,290 --> 01:38:07,510
Who wouldn't cheat?

2207
01:38:09,870 --> 01:38:13,170
He had a wife.

2208
01:38:15,470 --> 01:38:17,330
His wife left him for Lu Bu.

2209
01:38:17,950 --> 01:38:18,550
Because...

2210
01:38:19,190 --> 01:38:20,230
It's Lu Bu.

2211
01:38:20,530 --> 01:38:21,430
Who wouldn't?

2212
01:38:21,570 --> 01:38:22,110
To be fair.

2213
01:38:25,830 --> 01:38:27,330
To be fair.

2214
01:38:28,050 --> 01:38:29,630
Yeah, but then like...

2215
01:38:29,630 --> 01:38:31,090
When you know that...

2216
01:38:31,090 --> 01:38:33,110
His wife has always...

2217
01:38:33,110 --> 01:38:34,910
I forgive him now.

2218
01:38:35,050 --> 01:38:36,710
We were all wrong.

2219
01:38:37,070 --> 01:38:39,630
Thank you for the super chat.

2220
01:38:39,830 --> 01:38:41,170
Thank you, thank you.

2221
01:38:41,930 --> 01:38:42,490
Thank you.

2222
01:38:42,810 --> 01:38:44,890
Guys, I forgive him...

2223
01:38:44,890 --> 01:38:46,590
For all the atrocities he's committed.

2224
01:38:46,730 --> 01:38:48,410
He was just misunderstood, guys.

2225
01:38:48,670 --> 01:38:49,830
I mean, look at him.

2226
01:38:50,190 --> 01:38:52,530
He looks like a misunderstood man.

2227
01:38:58,510 --> 01:39:00,710
Oh shit, my horse is Walnut.

2228
01:39:02,870 --> 01:39:04,610
Oh my god, Walnut!

2229
01:39:07,470 --> 01:39:09,150
Okay, I completed the training.

2230
01:39:09,150 --> 01:39:11,590
I completed this one.

2231
01:39:16,820 --> 01:39:18,840
Okay, can I unlock this yet?

2232
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:19,520
I can.

2233
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:22,000
Alright.

2234
01:39:23,940 --> 01:39:25,940
Koi hired all the BLM.

2235
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:27,840
Thank you for the super chat.

2236
01:39:28,120 --> 01:39:28,280
Thank you.

2237
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:37,920
Oh wait, there's items over there.

2238
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:41,120
Alright.

2239
01:39:42,020 --> 01:39:42,480
Freedom!

2240
01:39:46,940 --> 01:39:48,420
There's a gem over there too.

2241
01:39:48,420 --> 01:39:49,020
Oh no.

2242
01:39:51,540 --> 01:39:51,900
Alright.

2243
01:40:01,900 --> 01:40:04,720
I feel like I'm playing a dating sim, not gonna lie.

2244
01:40:05,380 --> 01:40:06,140
But like...

2245
01:40:06,140 --> 01:40:07,340
I feel like I'm playing a...

2246
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:09,180
Oh my god, they knew it.

2247
01:40:09,180 --> 01:40:14,020
We always talk about the three kingdoms, but not the romance part of the three.

2248
01:40:14,260 --> 01:40:14,700
Finally!

2249
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:17,220
After 25 years!

2250
01:40:17,540 --> 01:40:21,300
We finally got the romance of the romance of the three kingdoms.

2251
01:40:21,820 --> 01:40:24,720
That's what we've been missing out this entire time.

2252
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:26,260
That's how...

2253
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:28,820
Finally!

2254
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:33,320
After 25 plus years, we finally got what we've all been wanting.

2255
01:40:39,180 --> 01:40:41,320
G-Province is the Yellow Turban's headquarters.

2256
01:40:41,540 --> 01:40:45,680
In this battle, we'll likely be taking on the main force.

2257
01:40:45,940 --> 01:40:47,080
Jaws, thank you for the super chat.

2258
01:40:47,200 --> 01:40:47,400
Thank you.

2259
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:50,100
Go show those hippies who's boss.

2260
01:40:50,540 --> 01:40:52,380
Thank you for the super chat.

2261
01:40:52,520 --> 01:40:53,700
Thank you, thank you.

2262
01:40:56,120 --> 01:40:56,540
Alright.

2263
01:40:57,940 --> 01:41:01,360
We'll be fighting a variant, but they may also give us a chance to quell the uprising for good.

2264
01:41:02,060 --> 01:41:06,760
I'm told that the government forces will be taking the field under the command of Lord Dong Zhuo.

2265
01:41:07,260 --> 01:41:09,940
However, we have not received any particular orders for this battle.

2266
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:13,380
I suppose we would assume that we are free to fight as we please.

2267
01:41:14,540 --> 01:41:17,540
Not yet, but we cannot defeat their main force on our own.

2268
01:41:17,640 --> 01:41:21,200
We must work with the government forces if we hope to bring down Zhengyao.

2269
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:23,100
That's right.

2270
01:41:23,260 --> 01:41:25,700
As far as I can see, both sides of the battle are equal in strength.

2271
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:27,940
Jesus Christ, he's protected by...

2272
01:41:27,940 --> 01:41:29,680
Oh my god, I'm scared to fight Zhengyao.

2273
01:41:29,820 --> 01:41:31,620
He's actually gonna be so fucking strong.

2274
01:41:33,380 --> 01:41:33,820
Um...

2275
01:41:33,820 --> 01:41:35,740
He has the power of magic, guys.

2276
01:41:40,380 --> 01:41:42,620
Some of the females in this game look dead drunk.

2277
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:47,200
I've only seen one female in this game so far.

2278
01:41:48,040 --> 01:41:49,240
Like, I don't...

2279
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:53,120
Not gonna lie, it's a little weird that like...

2280
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:54,520
Um...

2281
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:56,760
Usually in the beginning, they would put like...

2282
01:41:56,760 --> 01:41:59,940
You can see some of the female characters in the beginning.

2283
01:42:00,300 --> 01:42:02,740
But it is a little weird that...

2284
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:04,040
That...

2285
01:42:04,740 --> 01:42:06,420
We've only got one.

2286
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:07,380
We've...

2287
01:42:07,380 --> 01:42:11,180
So far, but a lot of handsome men.

2288
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:13,840
It is a little...

2289
01:42:16,220 --> 01:42:20,220
Like, where's my Diaochan and Sunshanchan?

2290
01:42:22,520 --> 01:42:23,080
And...

2291
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:25,500
To be fair, they all come in later.

2292
01:42:26,040 --> 01:42:29,080
But like, in the previous games, they put them in the beginning.

2293
01:42:29,300 --> 01:42:30,140
Because they're...

2294
01:42:30,140 --> 01:42:32,120
Even though they're supposed to be super young.

2295
01:42:32,280 --> 01:42:33,840
But they haven't grown up yet.

2296
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:36,220
So I assume we're gonna see them...

2297
01:42:36,220 --> 01:42:37,520
Later on in the game.

2298
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:39,200
Because like...

2299
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:41,220
They have no importance yet.

2300
01:42:41,380 --> 01:42:42,980
They have no...

2301
01:42:42,980 --> 01:42:45,380
They have no importance until like...

2302
01:42:45,380 --> 01:42:46,320
In the next chapter.

2303
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:53,540
Yeah, Sunshanchan is like...

2304
01:42:53,540 --> 01:42:55,120
I don't even know if she was born yet.

2305
01:42:55,480 --> 01:42:57,380
I think she's like...

2306
01:42:57,380 --> 01:42:59,480
She's like 10 or something right now.

2307
01:42:59,980 --> 01:43:02,600
If we're going for historical accuracy.

2308
01:43:05,900 --> 01:43:07,220
It's sad that...

2309
01:43:07,220 --> 01:43:07,840
The bravery and...

2310
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:10,820
Brutality often go hand in hand.

2311
01:43:11,080 --> 01:43:13,180
But I admit, I also have a...

2312
01:43:13,180 --> 01:43:14,740
Bad feeling about all of this.

2313
01:43:16,240 --> 01:43:17,620
Oh, I mean his army looks...

2314
01:43:17,620 --> 01:43:17,800
Yeah.

2315
01:43:18,300 --> 01:43:19,300
He has Lu Bu, right?

2316
01:43:19,900 --> 01:43:21,240
He should have it right now.

2317
01:43:23,100 --> 01:43:25,320
Chapter 2 has a lot of time to date women.

2318
01:43:26,360 --> 01:43:27,420
But their stream comes with...

2319
01:43:27,420 --> 01:43:28,720
Towards both friends and enemies.

2320
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:31,460
In this game, we'll need to react quickly to challenges as they arise.

2321
01:43:31,640 --> 01:43:33,240
That will likely be our plan to battle.

2322
01:43:33,240 --> 01:43:35,400
We're going to get into a fight without a strategy.

2323
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:36,780
But that is beyond our control.

2324
01:43:37,240 --> 01:43:39,360
All we can do now... I'm going to take the building to the right.

2325
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:41,120
Alright.

2326
01:43:41,560 --> 01:43:42,080
There's me.

2327
01:43:43,540 --> 01:43:44,500
Alright, I'm ready.

2328
01:43:45,080 --> 01:43:46,660
Is there anything I should get?

2329
01:43:47,580 --> 01:43:48,380
Recruit spear.

2330
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,400
Okay, all the other spears are...

2331
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:52,640
Bad.

2332
01:43:53,620 --> 01:43:54,560
I need to sell these.

2333
01:43:54,700 --> 01:43:56,800
I need to go to the store and sell these real quick.

2334
01:43:57,340 --> 01:43:57,780
Walnut!

2335
01:43:58,060 --> 01:43:59,180
My little guy!

2336
01:43:59,180 --> 01:43:59,980
Yeah!

2337
01:44:04,110 --> 01:44:06,530
I'm not ending stream until I kill Lu Bu.

2338
01:44:07,130 --> 01:44:08,910
Until I pursue him and kill him.

2339
01:44:10,510 --> 01:44:11,430
My little walnut.

2340
01:44:13,990 --> 01:44:15,710
Alright, let's go this way.

2341
01:44:15,730 --> 01:44:17,730
I want to take the fortress to my right.

2342
01:44:19,650 --> 01:44:23,350
They will learn our way of peace and benevolence through violence!

2343
01:44:23,350 --> 01:44:24,890
We will lead the attack!

2344
01:44:25,570 --> 01:44:26,930
Punch through the enemy formation!

2345
01:44:27,330 --> 01:44:29,150
And secure the central stronghold!

2346
01:44:30,170 --> 01:44:31,490
We march at once!

2347
01:44:31,530 --> 01:44:33,210
Left to fend in red battle areas?

2348
01:44:33,390 --> 01:44:33,670
Okay.

2349
01:44:34,390 --> 01:44:34,970
That's fine.

2350
01:44:36,110 --> 01:44:39,450
It looks like Dong Zhuo's forces are going for a frontal attack.

2351
01:44:39,810 --> 01:44:40,250
Wait, where?

2352
01:44:40,510 --> 01:44:42,910
Then we will help them by destabilizing the enemy.

2353
01:44:44,790 --> 01:44:45,870
Get out of here!

2354
01:44:45,930 --> 01:44:46,630
You're too tall!

2355
01:44:46,910 --> 01:44:48,290
Short King shall rise up!

2356
01:44:48,690 --> 01:44:51,010
The enemy officer has been defeated.

2357
01:44:52,910 --> 01:44:57,550
In every iteration of Dynasty Warriors, I have always defeated Lu Bu!

2358
01:44:58,430 --> 01:45:00,690
Origins shall not change this for me!

2359
01:45:03,970 --> 01:45:07,390
I refuse to let Origins be the first one!

2360
01:45:08,250 --> 01:45:10,290
I have always pursued Lu Bu!

2361
01:45:10,470 --> 01:45:13,070
And I shall pursue him until the death!

2362
01:45:13,770 --> 01:45:15,570
To the dawn of time!

2363
01:45:18,730 --> 01:45:19,830
That's right!

2364
01:45:20,270 --> 01:45:20,990
I will break you!

2365
01:45:20,990 --> 01:45:23,670
Why not marry him instead?

2366
01:45:24,210 --> 01:45:25,110
Okay, guys.

2367
01:45:25,170 --> 01:45:27,830
There are two different people that play Dynasty Warriors.

2368
01:45:31,030 --> 01:45:33,150
Always pursue Lu Bu!

2369
01:45:34,630 --> 01:45:36,330
I ain't no coward!

2370
01:45:38,470 --> 01:45:41,450
Does Lu Bu have a restraining order against you?

2371
01:45:43,770 --> 01:45:44,570
Alright.

2372
01:45:44,970 --> 01:45:46,390
We did it.

2373
01:45:47,670 --> 01:45:48,770
Get over here!

2374
01:45:48,770 --> 01:45:50,230
Doki is both of them.

2375
01:45:56,030 --> 01:45:57,430
That's right.

2376
01:46:07,890 --> 01:46:10,530
Get over here!

2377
01:46:11,270 --> 01:46:12,530
You're too tall!

2378
01:46:14,090 --> 01:46:17,930
I refuse to let tall people rule Ancient China!

2379
01:46:23,310 --> 01:46:24,930
That's fucking right!

2380
01:46:28,450 --> 01:46:32,210
It is time for the Short Kings to rise up and take power!

2381
01:46:34,530 --> 01:46:35,670
Okay, nice.

2382
01:46:38,950 --> 01:46:39,950
Wait, what?

2383
01:46:39,950 --> 01:46:40,990
Who fucking died?

2384
01:46:41,850 --> 01:46:42,790
Oh, shit.

2385
01:46:42,870 --> 01:46:43,150
Okay.

2386
01:46:43,250 --> 01:46:44,050
Sorry, guys.

2387
01:46:44,370 --> 01:46:45,930
I'm gonna leave this fight.

2388
01:46:47,150 --> 01:46:48,110
Oh, shit.

2389
01:46:48,190 --> 01:46:48,530
Okay.

2390
01:46:48,670 --> 01:46:49,070
No!

2391
01:46:51,390 --> 01:46:51,830
Oh, no.

2392
01:46:54,710 --> 01:46:54,970
Okay.

2393
01:46:55,290 --> 01:46:56,250
That's a little awkward.

2394
01:46:56,510 --> 01:46:56,990
No!

2395
01:46:59,610 --> 01:47:01,450
Eat your buns!

2396
01:47:01,690 --> 01:47:02,890
Oh, he ate his...

2397
01:47:02,890 --> 01:47:04,190
He ate his buns.

2398
01:47:04,610 --> 01:47:05,410
It's fine.

2399
01:47:06,230 --> 01:47:06,590
It's fine.

2400
01:47:06,650 --> 01:47:07,550
He ate his buns, guys.

2401
01:47:07,550 --> 01:47:08,170
We're okay.

2402
01:47:10,930 --> 01:47:11,690
We're okay.

2403
01:47:11,850 --> 01:47:13,250
They all ate their buns.

2404
01:47:14,270 --> 01:47:15,390
They did their job.

2405
01:47:16,030 --> 01:47:16,830
Oh, my god.

2406
01:47:16,850 --> 01:47:17,690
They're so inspired.

2407
01:47:17,770 --> 01:47:18,530
This is not fair.

2408
01:47:23,270 --> 01:47:24,230
Alright, here we go.

2409
01:47:24,390 --> 01:47:24,710
Come on.

2410
01:47:24,790 --> 01:47:25,290
Get over here.

2411
01:47:25,610 --> 01:47:26,090
Get over here.

2412
01:47:28,910 --> 01:47:29,230
Alright.

2413
01:47:29,970 --> 01:47:30,950
I live these.

2414
01:47:31,450 --> 01:47:32,610
He lives these, too.

2415
01:47:33,150 --> 01:47:35,550
You almost died to these weak little guys?

2416
01:47:35,550 --> 01:47:36,470
Oh, my god.

2417
01:47:36,510 --> 01:47:38,210
The real fight is over there.

2418
01:47:39,250 --> 01:47:40,010
Like, excuse me.

2419
01:47:40,070 --> 01:47:43,550
I was trying to fight a real general earlier.

2420
01:47:44,490 --> 01:47:45,650
And you almost died to...

2421
01:47:45,650 --> 01:47:46,230
Oh, shit.

2422
01:47:46,950 --> 01:47:47,630
Oh, fuck.

2423
01:47:47,730 --> 01:47:47,910
Okay.

2424
01:47:48,190 --> 01:47:48,830
I couldn't see.

2425
01:47:48,910 --> 01:47:49,790
There was too many people.

2426
01:47:50,390 --> 01:47:51,910
There were so many people.

2427
01:47:53,450 --> 01:47:54,330
Jesus Christ.

2428
01:47:54,490 --> 01:47:55,810
This guy is so annoying, though.

2429
01:47:57,530 --> 01:47:59,990
Oh, there's too many little guys around me.

2430
01:48:00,030 --> 01:48:01,330
And then there's also arrows.

2431
01:48:01,710 --> 01:48:03,170
And where's my arrows?

2432
01:48:05,590 --> 01:48:07,050
I don't understand.

2433
01:48:10,070 --> 01:48:11,850
Where are my arrows?

2434
01:48:12,450 --> 01:48:14,350
I should also have archers.

2435
01:48:15,110 --> 01:48:16,830
That's also what I miss in the old...

2436
01:48:17,690 --> 01:48:19,310
In the old Dynasty Warriors.

2437
01:48:19,610 --> 01:48:21,990
You can recruit, like, archers to fight with you.

2438
01:48:22,110 --> 01:48:23,610
Like, little bodyguards and stuff.

2439
01:48:23,790 --> 01:48:25,470
And, like, I'm important.

2440
01:48:26,250 --> 01:48:27,690
Why don't I have, like, bodyguards?

2441
01:48:30,030 --> 01:48:31,130
And then they die.

2442
01:48:31,190 --> 01:48:31,510
It's fine.

2443
01:48:31,570 --> 01:48:33,330
You can just get another bodyguard.

2444
01:48:33,330 --> 01:48:33,830
Okay.

2445
01:48:34,170 --> 01:48:36,790
I'm just gonna make sure...

2446
01:48:36,790 --> 01:48:38,250
I just need to get rid of...

2447
01:48:38,250 --> 01:48:39,610
Okay, guys.

2448
01:48:39,890 --> 01:48:44,910
This is a respectful 1v1, guys.

2449
01:48:45,810 --> 01:48:46,950
Excuse me.

2450
01:48:47,930 --> 01:48:50,270
It's a respectful 1v1.

2451
01:48:50,850 --> 01:48:52,070
As all wars should be.

2452
01:48:52,830 --> 01:48:53,890
Jesus Christ.

2453
01:48:55,550 --> 01:48:57,650
I can't even attack!

2454
01:48:58,370 --> 01:48:59,150
Okay, we got it.

2455
01:48:59,510 --> 01:49:01,110
Alright, now it's your turn.

2456
01:49:01,110 --> 01:49:02,150
Alright, you thought...

2457
01:49:02,150 --> 01:49:03,630
You tried a 1v2?

2458
01:49:03,990 --> 01:49:05,200
You get punished for that.

2459
01:49:07,070 --> 01:49:07,990
Um, no.

2460
01:49:08,130 --> 01:49:09,370
I am not a bodyguard.

2461
01:49:09,490 --> 01:49:12,270
I am very important in the history of the Three Kingdoms.

2462
01:49:12,390 --> 01:49:15,270
If you look through the books, you'll find stories about me.

2463
01:49:21,850 --> 01:49:26,370
Wait, how did I... I fucked up my map.

2464
01:49:26,690 --> 01:49:26,870
Wait.

2465
01:49:27,950 --> 01:49:28,410
Guys!

2466
01:49:28,410 --> 01:49:30,590
How do I fix my map, guys?

2467
01:49:30,850 --> 01:49:31,130
Oh.

2468
01:49:31,810 --> 01:49:32,710
Oh no.

2469
01:49:36,130 --> 01:49:42,050
Um, if you open the book and look at a random page for the romance of the Three Kingdoms, you'll see my name.

2470
01:49:44,190 --> 01:49:47,590
I'm not... There's no way I get erased from history, guys.

2471
01:49:47,670 --> 01:49:48,310
There's no way.

2472
01:49:48,770 --> 01:49:50,010
That's crazy.

2473
01:49:51,050 --> 01:49:56,210
You mean everything I've ever done is not even gonna like, register?

2474
01:49:56,210 --> 01:49:57,530
Like...

2475
01:49:57,530 --> 01:49:59,050
Oh, I pressed D-pad.

2476
01:50:03,070 --> 01:50:03,750
Alright.

2477
01:50:04,110 --> 01:50:06,170
Oh shit, that is so strong.

2478
01:50:08,290 --> 01:50:10,810
Okay, I'm gonna kill the reinforcements too.

2479
01:50:11,830 --> 01:50:13,470
That's right, walk away.

2480
01:50:15,250 --> 01:50:16,210
Alright, nice.

2481
01:50:17,350 --> 01:50:19,650
Alright, let me go downstairs.

2482
01:50:20,750 --> 01:50:22,010
And I killed the...

2483
01:50:22,010 --> 01:50:23,250
What the fuck?

2484
01:50:24,270 --> 01:50:26,210
Everybody's just running around.

2485
01:50:30,810 --> 01:50:33,590
Okay, we're gonna kill the people downstairs first.

2486
01:50:34,730 --> 01:50:35,270
Oh.

2487
01:50:35,870 --> 01:50:39,650
How do they have so many fucking forces?

2488
01:50:41,970 --> 01:50:43,070
Where's Cao Cao?

2489
01:50:45,790 --> 01:50:47,890
Okay, we need reinforcements too.

2490
01:50:49,630 --> 01:50:51,370
Wait, he took my castle?

2491
01:50:54,410 --> 01:50:55,290
Oh no.

2492
01:50:56,530 --> 01:50:57,570
I need to go back.

2493
01:50:57,670 --> 01:51:00,690
I'm trying to go back to the main camp, but there's so many people!

2494
01:51:03,270 --> 01:51:04,230
Oh no.

2495
01:51:05,990 --> 01:51:06,270
Okay.

2496
01:51:09,230 --> 01:51:11,130
Alright, there's no way Guan Yu's gonna die.

2497
01:51:11,250 --> 01:51:12,770
I refuse to believe that.

2498
01:51:14,010 --> 01:51:15,870
I think Guan Yu can take it.

2499
01:51:17,490 --> 01:51:19,430
This is not his time to die yet.

2500
01:51:21,890 --> 01:51:23,170
Jesus Christ.

2501
01:51:23,830 --> 01:51:24,470
Alright.

2502
01:51:25,010 --> 01:51:25,970
We got another guy.

2503
01:51:27,990 --> 01:51:29,790
Stop feeling moral!

2504
01:51:33,870 --> 01:51:35,070
Oh my god.

2505
01:51:37,130 --> 01:51:39,130
Your eyes can do more than see.

2506
01:51:39,230 --> 01:51:41,430
They also enable you such as health and...

2507
01:51:41,430 --> 01:51:41,730
Okay.

2508
01:51:42,570 --> 01:51:43,590
Who's dying?

2509
01:51:44,990 --> 01:51:46,130
Oh shit.

2510
01:51:46,630 --> 01:51:47,410
Oh my god.

2511
01:51:47,410 --> 01:51:47,810
Please?

2512
01:51:47,950 --> 01:51:49,670
I wanted to take my castle back!

2513
01:51:49,730 --> 01:51:49,910
Okay.

2514
01:51:50,510 --> 01:51:50,970
That's fine.

2515
01:51:51,030 --> 01:51:51,350
That's fine.

2516
01:51:51,390 --> 01:51:51,770
That's fine.

2517
01:51:51,910 --> 01:51:52,890
We can't let him die.

2518
01:51:52,990 --> 01:51:54,050
Oh, this is bad.

2519
01:51:54,110 --> 01:51:54,770
Okay, it's fine.

2520
01:51:54,810 --> 01:51:55,090
It's fine.

2521
01:51:55,170 --> 01:51:56,030
Freedom is coming in.

2522
01:51:56,330 --> 01:51:57,190
Okay, don't worry.

2523
01:51:57,270 --> 01:51:58,590
He's gonna eat some bread, guys.

2524
01:51:59,010 --> 01:52:00,330
Okay, that's okay.

2525
01:52:00,690 --> 01:52:01,570
He's just gonna...

2526
01:52:01,570 --> 01:52:04,950
He's just 1v4ing and then he's getting shot at by 200 arrows.

2527
01:52:05,450 --> 01:52:06,250
That's okay.

2528
01:52:06,650 --> 01:52:06,830
See?

2529
01:52:06,930 --> 01:52:07,330
There you go.

2530
01:52:07,350 --> 01:52:07,510
See?

2531
01:52:07,530 --> 01:52:08,030
I told you.

2532
01:52:08,590 --> 01:52:09,170
I told you.

2533
01:52:09,250 --> 01:52:10,210
Everything will be fine.

2534
01:52:12,290 --> 01:52:12,930
There you go.

2535
01:52:12,950 --> 01:52:13,130
See?

2536
01:52:13,130 --> 01:52:13,410
See?

2537
01:52:14,870 --> 01:52:16,790
Alright, I just used this on a baby.

2538
01:52:16,930 --> 01:52:17,590
But that's okay.

2539
01:52:17,810 --> 01:52:20,310
We have two other captains that we can kill.

2540
01:52:21,990 --> 01:52:23,430
Alright, you're not dying here today!

2541
01:52:23,850 --> 01:52:26,610
You're dying in three more fights, but not today!

2542
01:52:28,310 --> 01:52:29,350
It's not written yet!

2543
01:52:30,710 --> 01:52:31,490
Don't worry!

2544
01:52:31,650 --> 01:52:32,570
I'll kill you later!

2545
01:52:33,750 --> 01:52:35,790
This is not your story to die in!

2546
01:52:37,550 --> 01:52:38,490
Alright, nice.

2547
01:52:41,690 --> 01:52:43,750
Using ults on babies.

2548
01:52:44,210 --> 01:52:46,010
Look, I got desperate, okay?

2549
01:52:46,450 --> 01:52:47,670
Our guy was whining.

2550
01:52:48,270 --> 01:52:50,430
Our guy was fucking wah wah wah.

2551
01:52:51,470 --> 01:52:53,330
I was trying to make sure he lives.

2552
01:52:57,330 --> 01:52:59,410
Why is he over there?

2553
01:53:01,230 --> 01:53:02,590
Okay, please eat bread.

2554
01:53:02,710 --> 01:53:03,270
Please eat bread.

2555
01:53:03,390 --> 01:53:04,170
Please eat bread.

2556
01:53:04,350 --> 01:53:04,570
Please.

2557
01:53:04,830 --> 01:53:06,430
Oh, thank God he ate bread.

2558
01:53:06,990 --> 01:53:07,970
Thank God.

2559
01:53:08,110 --> 01:53:10,770
I feel like they only eat bread when I show up.

2560
01:53:10,850 --> 01:53:11,870
They're like, oh she's here.

2561
01:53:11,950 --> 01:53:13,730
I can finally...

2562
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:15,870
I'll finally eat.

2563
01:53:17,810 --> 01:53:18,310
Nice.

2564
01:53:19,630 --> 01:53:21,110
You almost died to him?

2565
01:53:22,390 --> 01:53:23,730
Bread saves all.

2566
01:53:24,490 --> 01:53:24,990
Okay.

2567
01:53:26,670 --> 01:53:28,490
Alright, then we have to kill this guy.

2568
01:53:30,250 --> 01:53:32,690
Okay, there's no way he was gonna lose to him.

2569
01:53:32,810 --> 01:53:33,390
Come on.

2570
01:53:33,450 --> 01:53:34,910
Come on, Guan Yun.

2571
01:53:35,250 --> 01:53:39,590
You're known as like one of the best warriors in China.

2572
01:53:39,830 --> 01:53:41,110
Come on, Guan Yun.

2573
01:53:41,270 --> 01:53:43,550
We made you into a fucking guy.

2574
01:53:43,950 --> 01:53:50,930
You're gonna let this nobody that basically no one has ever talked to except for the Dynasty Warrior games?

2575
01:53:51,050 --> 01:53:52,330
You're really gonna let him.

2576
01:53:52,730 --> 01:53:53,590
Like, look at him.

2577
01:53:54,070 --> 01:53:54,910
Look at him.

2578
01:53:55,010 --> 01:53:55,950
Look at his head.

2579
01:53:56,570 --> 01:53:58,190
His head's so stupid.

2580
01:54:00,790 --> 01:54:02,830
Oh, Guan Yun was winning.

2581
01:54:03,210 --> 01:54:05,710
Doki, you interrupted his fight.

2582
01:54:06,030 --> 01:54:07,930
He was not winning shit.

2583
01:54:08,210 --> 01:54:12,370
He literally got like 30 damage in and then that was all he did.

2584
01:54:13,690 --> 01:54:15,330
It's a good hat.

2585
01:54:20,130 --> 01:54:22,370
You're just jealous of his hat.

2586
01:54:22,770 --> 01:54:24,510
It's a good hat, Doki.

2587
01:54:26,790 --> 01:54:27,750
Oh, look at that.

2588
01:54:28,250 --> 01:54:30,450
Guan Yun didn't even come back to help me on this fight.

2589
01:54:30,450 --> 01:54:33,010
I came back to help him and he's like, you got this.

2590
01:54:36,250 --> 01:54:36,670
Nice.

2591
01:54:37,390 --> 01:54:39,190
Oh shit, I got his weapons too.

2592
01:54:39,930 --> 01:54:40,750
Now I have the fist.

2593
01:54:42,370 --> 01:54:44,050
Oh my god, I'm Iron Fist.

2594
01:54:44,790 --> 01:54:45,790
Wait, I'm Iron Fist.

2595
01:54:46,230 --> 01:54:46,390
Wait.

2596
01:54:47,730 --> 01:54:49,350
You can never escape.

2597
01:54:50,450 --> 01:54:52,450
Wait, how do I...

2598
01:54:55,640 --> 01:54:57,540
JR, thank you for your very first super chat.

2599
01:54:57,620 --> 01:54:57,840
Thank you.

2600
01:54:58,780 --> 01:54:59,540
Hey, Doki.

2601
01:54:59,780 --> 01:55:00,780
Hope you're doing well.

2602
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:03,060
It's somehow snowing where I am, which is northern Florida.

2603
01:55:03,340 --> 01:55:04,520
I love global warming.

2604
01:55:05,200 --> 01:55:06,180
Guys, I don't...

2605
01:55:06,180 --> 01:55:07,180
I'm a little worried.

2606
01:55:12,700 --> 01:55:13,500
Oh no.

2607
01:55:13,880 --> 01:55:15,180
You never escape.

2608
01:55:15,960 --> 01:55:17,480
But thank you for your very first super chat.

2609
01:55:17,540 --> 01:55:17,820
Thank you.

2610
01:55:17,900 --> 01:55:18,600
Thank you.

2611
01:55:19,420 --> 01:55:21,800
Alright, let's just get rid of these guys really fast.

2612
01:55:22,420 --> 01:55:24,040
Let's get rid of the guy that has a name.

2613
01:55:24,520 --> 01:55:26,760
Obviously the no name guy is not that important.

2614
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:29,080
Alright, you're too tall.

2615
01:55:30,760 --> 01:55:31,880
Wait, I can crypter in battle?

2616
01:55:32,420 --> 01:55:33,200
Wait, I can.

2617
01:55:33,860 --> 01:55:34,520
Alright, it's time.

2618
01:55:34,680 --> 01:55:37,820
I know this weapon might be... Wait, it's stronger.

2619
01:55:38,220 --> 01:55:38,900
Wait, is it stronger?

2620
01:55:40,300 --> 01:55:41,520
Oh my god, it is.

2621
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:42,280
It's time.

2622
01:55:42,940 --> 01:55:43,740
That's right.

2623
01:55:44,060 --> 01:55:45,460
I'm Iron Fisting now.

2624
01:55:45,920 --> 01:55:46,720
That's right.

2625
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:49,740
That's right, I'm parrying.

2626
01:55:50,600 --> 01:55:51,760
Oh my god.

2627
01:55:51,860 --> 01:55:52,580
Wait, what?

2628
01:55:53,060 --> 01:55:54,120
Oh, there's like different...

2629
01:55:54,120 --> 01:55:56,220
There's actually different combos.

2630
01:55:58,520 --> 01:56:01,140
Wait, they have different combos and everything.

2631
01:56:02,440 --> 01:56:04,700
Oh, I'm gonna grab the castle back.

2632
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:06,060
I'm pretty sure they'll be fine.

2633
01:56:08,140 --> 01:56:11,000
Yeah, I have different stances that I can use.

2634
01:56:12,380 --> 01:56:15,100
No way she can parry now.

2635
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:19,000
Alright, here we go.

2636
01:56:21,140 --> 01:56:22,200
Alright, get over here.

2637
01:56:22,220 --> 01:56:23,780
I'm taking back my castle.

2638
01:56:26,080 --> 01:56:28,540
Okay, Guanyin, you should be fine.

2639
01:56:28,640 --> 01:56:30,160
Oh my god, wait, that's so cool.

2640
01:56:31,480 --> 01:56:35,040
Oh my god, I can like swap and everything too.

2641
01:56:36,400 --> 01:56:36,840
Oh!

2642
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:41,840
Now it's like, give me back my castle.

2643
01:56:42,140 --> 01:56:43,320
Give it back to me!

2644
01:56:44,200 --> 01:56:44,900
Give it back!

2645
01:56:45,560 --> 01:56:46,520
That's fucking right!

2646
01:56:47,060 --> 01:56:48,260
I shall beat you all up!

2647
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:52,580
This is my castle now.

2648
01:56:54,560 --> 01:56:55,400
That's right!

2649
01:56:55,460 --> 01:56:56,360
You are all free!

2650
01:56:57,620 --> 01:56:59,000
I love that scene.

2651
01:56:59,460 --> 01:57:01,440
You are all free now.

2652
01:57:02,680 --> 01:57:04,040
This kung fu hustle.

2653
01:57:05,240 --> 01:57:06,620
I'm beating these enemies off.

2654
01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:09,180
This is mine.

2655
01:57:10,840 --> 01:57:12,200
You got it back.

2656
01:57:13,780 --> 01:57:15,180
The classic.

2657
01:57:15,420 --> 01:57:17,100
That scene is amazing.

2658
01:57:22,230 --> 01:57:27,950
Alright, back to Okay, now we should be able to kill Zhengjiao, right?

2659
01:57:29,910 --> 01:57:31,050
Right, guys?

2660
01:57:31,730 --> 01:57:32,050
Alright.

2661
01:57:32,950 --> 01:57:36,570
There's no way he's gonna like trick us all this time, right?

2662
01:57:37,750 --> 01:57:40,850
There's gonna be no stupid magic tricks this time.

2663
01:57:42,850 --> 01:57:43,790
Alright, guys.

2664
01:57:43,830 --> 01:57:44,510
Are you guys ready?

2665
01:57:44,690 --> 01:57:45,330
I'm ready.

2666
01:57:46,390 --> 01:57:47,730
Oh, that's a lot of people.

2667
01:57:47,930 --> 01:57:48,990
Don't worry, they're civilians.

2668
01:57:50,690 --> 01:57:51,510
That makes...

2669
01:57:51,510 --> 01:57:55,090
That's not better, but like don't worry, they're not trained like us.

2670
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,820
A massive gathering can sometimes form a large force.

2671
01:58:03,120 --> 01:58:07,220
Officers will have high courage and will act posing a grave threat.

2672
01:58:07,380 --> 01:58:10,780
To bring that, you must defeat its officer, reducing its fighting strength and causing it to die.

2673
01:58:11,080 --> 01:58:13,440
After a large collapse, troops will...

2674
01:58:14,500 --> 01:58:15,100
That's easy.

2675
01:58:15,180 --> 01:58:17,000
That's basically what I've been doing this entire time.

2676
01:58:19,960 --> 01:58:20,740
Let's go!

2677
01:58:23,200 --> 01:58:24,880
Oh my god!

2678
01:58:25,400 --> 01:58:25,640
That's

2679
01:58:30,360 --> 01:58:30,640
it!

2680
01:58:31,220 --> 01:58:32,380
To war!

2681
01:58:39,660 --> 01:58:40,940
For Doki!

2682
01:58:46,680 --> 01:58:48,100
Holy shit!

2683
01:58:48,680 --> 01:58:50,520
That's actually so cool.

2684
01:58:50,760 --> 01:58:51,900
I love that.

2685
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:54,480
To for Doki!

2686
01:58:57,540 --> 01:58:58,900
Oh shit.

2687
01:59:02,680 --> 01:59:05,500
Oh my god, that's so cool.

2688
01:59:07,640 --> 01:59:08,260
Oh.

2689
01:59:10,020 --> 01:59:12,400
Jesus Christ, there's so many people.

2690
01:59:16,940 --> 01:59:18,060
That's fucking right.

2691
01:59:18,600 --> 01:59:20,120
I'm gonna keep punching you.

2692
01:59:20,560 --> 01:59:21,240
That's right!

2693
01:59:22,700 --> 01:59:23,180
Get kicked!

2694
01:59:24,620 --> 01:59:24,840
Oh!

2695
01:59:25,420 --> 01:59:26,060
What?!

2696
01:59:26,060 --> 01:59:27,480
That was such a parry!

2697
01:59:27,560 --> 01:59:28,380
That should have counted.

2698
01:59:29,820 --> 01:59:30,840
That should have counted.

2699
01:59:30,980 --> 01:59:31,500
That should have counted.

2700
01:59:33,340 --> 01:59:34,840
That should have fucking counted.

2701
01:59:36,460 --> 01:59:37,740
That's fucking right.

2702
01:59:38,340 --> 01:59:39,460
I think you're gonna get away with this.

2703
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:41,360
You might have...

2704
01:59:41,360 --> 01:59:42,840
You might have arrows.

2705
01:59:43,240 --> 01:59:44,060
Oh fuck, okay.

2706
01:59:44,100 --> 01:59:45,680
I'm getting lost in the sauce though.

2707
01:59:46,060 --> 01:59:47,900
I'm actually...

2708
01:59:47,900 --> 01:59:49,280
I'm getting a little lost.

2709
01:59:49,340 --> 01:59:50,520
There's way too many things.

2710
01:59:50,780 --> 01:59:52,160
Oh my god, please.

2711
01:59:52,500 --> 01:59:54,400
Oh my god, I'm gonna get to you though.

2712
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:55,420
There we go.

2713
01:59:57,040 --> 01:59:59,940
I got one of the... I got one of the large forces.

2714
02:00:00,100 --> 02:00:00,860
That's all that matters.

2715
02:00:02,580 --> 02:00:04,340
I said parry this, exactly.

2716
02:00:04,840 --> 02:00:05,100
Alright.

2717
02:00:05,820 --> 02:00:07,180
We gotta get rid of this leader.

2718
02:00:08,120 --> 02:00:09,160
Jesus Christ.

2719
02:00:12,360 --> 02:00:14,480
Wait, full infantry charge?

2720
02:00:16,280 --> 02:00:17,240
Oh no!

2721
02:00:17,820 --> 02:00:19,220
Oh, they're calling it!

2722
02:00:19,340 --> 02:00:22,540
The enemy is attempting to stop them by meeting certain conditions.

2723
02:00:22,540 --> 02:00:25,360
Okay, we got it.

2724
02:00:25,360 --> 02:00:26,500
Okay, we have to kill 200.

2725
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:29,860
Oh no, gotta get rid of the majority of the army.

2726
02:00:30,360 --> 02:00:31,020
Don't worry.

2727
02:00:31,540 --> 02:00:34,600
Okay, I will, but like after this, I have two minutes?!

2728
02:00:35,340 --> 02:00:36,320
Oh, this is bad.

2729
02:00:37,140 --> 02:00:39,680
It's so bad because I'm trying to kill a general too.

2730
02:00:41,160 --> 02:00:41,920
That's fine.

2731
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:42,760
38.

2732
02:00:44,640 --> 02:00:46,480
Army of one, that's right.

2733
02:00:47,880 --> 02:00:48,700
That's right.

2734
02:00:49,240 --> 02:00:51,960
Okay, now I'm ready to actually kill 200.

2735
02:00:53,140 --> 02:00:54,560
I'm ready to kill 200.

2736
02:00:55,580 --> 02:00:56,760
That's fucking right.

2737
02:00:57,660 --> 02:00:58,520
60, 89.

2738
02:00:59,180 --> 02:01:00,400
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2739
02:01:00,480 --> 02:01:02,520
I'm fucking, I'm heading there as fast as I can.

2740
02:01:04,540 --> 02:01:05,260
That's alright.

2741
02:01:05,860 --> 02:01:06,320
121.

2742
02:01:06,580 --> 02:01:08,260
I can make it, I can make it, I can make it.

2743
02:01:08,680 --> 02:01:09,200
I believe.

2744
02:01:10,120 --> 02:01:10,940
Oh, I believe.

2745
02:01:11,080 --> 02:01:12,620
Oh, there's so many people!

2746
02:01:13,780 --> 02:01:14,700
160, 70.

2747
02:01:15,540 --> 02:01:16,260
30 more.

2748
02:01:17,160 --> 02:01:18,760
Oh, I'm getting beat up everywhere!

2749
02:01:18,760 --> 02:01:18,920
There's so many people!

2750
02:01:21,680 --> 02:01:22,840
Everybody's fucking...

2751
02:01:22,840 --> 02:01:25,220
They're all, like, throwing me around!

2752
02:01:25,580 --> 02:01:26,600
Oh, one more, one more, one more!

2753
02:01:30,340 --> 02:01:31,500
Holy fuck!

2754
02:01:31,880 --> 02:01:35,960
I feel like I was just flip-flopping everywhere.

2755
02:01:36,520 --> 02:01:40,840
There were so many people, like, where do I go?

2756
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,780
There were so many people on me.

2757
02:01:45,200 --> 02:01:46,720
That was actually crazy.

2758
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:50,480
That was close!

2759
02:01:50,860 --> 02:01:52,500
That was so close, that was so close.

2760
02:01:53,740 --> 02:01:55,200
I need to find, like, bread.

2761
02:01:55,760 --> 02:01:57,200
I ran out of bread though.

2762
02:01:57,380 --> 02:01:58,200
That's pretty bad.

2763
02:02:00,600 --> 02:02:01,380
There we go.

2764
02:02:02,840 --> 02:02:04,040
Can't get him though.

2765
02:02:04,200 --> 02:02:06,900
Please, one of them has to be able to...

2766
02:02:06,900 --> 02:02:12,800
I'm, like, a little worried because, like, I really, really need bread.

2767
02:02:14,420 --> 02:02:15,840
Please, somebody drop some.

2768
02:02:15,960 --> 02:02:16,420
Thank you.

2769
02:02:16,420 --> 02:02:18,120
Oh, thank god.

2770
02:02:18,660 --> 02:02:22,360
One last boss right here.

2771
02:02:26,080 --> 02:02:27,760
Grapple, get grappled, get grappled!

2772
02:02:28,620 --> 02:02:30,060
That's fucking right!

2773
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:32,700
That's here!

2774
02:02:33,080 --> 02:02:34,360
I'm gonna use it!

2775
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:37,480
Push him!

2776
02:02:38,840 --> 02:02:40,840
Oh my god, that did nothing though.

2777
02:02:41,100 --> 02:02:43,400
That actually did nothing.

2778
02:02:46,420 --> 02:02:47,760
Who's gonna lose?

2779
02:02:48,060 --> 02:02:49,600
Oh, it's Chen Yao right there.

2780
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:52,360
Oh, I'm a little worried right now.

2781
02:02:52,480 --> 02:02:55,040
I am maybe a little worried because...

2782
02:02:55,040 --> 02:02:55,040
oh!

2783
02:02:56,520 --> 02:02:57,980
Oh, I don't have bread!

2784
02:02:58,520 --> 02:02:59,800
I'm... I'm scared.

2785
02:03:00,240 --> 02:03:02,160
I am 1 HP, guys!

2786
02:03:02,380 --> 02:03:05,920
I am 1 HP and I don't have bread, guys!

2787
02:03:06,600 --> 02:03:09,660
I... I have zero bread, guys!

2788
02:03:10,480 --> 02:03:12,600
Oh, what do I do?

2789
02:03:12,600 --> 02:03:12,780
Oh!

2790
02:03:14,820 --> 02:03:15,860
Oh, no!

2791
02:03:17,240 --> 02:03:18,960
Lu Bei, what?!

2792
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:20,720
Lu Bei, eat bread right now!

2793
02:03:22,980 --> 02:03:24,960
Lu Bei, eat some bread!

2794
02:03:25,160 --> 02:03:28,100
Please, please, eat some bread for the love of god!

2795
02:03:28,520 --> 02:03:30,020
For the love of god!

2796
02:03:34,860 --> 02:03:35,840
Lu Bei, please!

2797
02:03:36,060 --> 02:03:37,040
For the love of god!

2798
02:03:38,840 --> 02:03:39,260
Lu Bei!

2799
02:03:40,740 --> 02:03:41,580
Lu Bei!

2800
02:03:42,080 --> 02:03:42,640
Please!

2801
02:03:42,980 --> 02:03:43,480
Please!

2802
02:03:44,580 --> 02:03:48,040
For the love of god, just eat anything!

2803
02:03:49,080 --> 02:03:50,800
I just don't die!

2804
02:03:51,240 --> 02:03:51,840
Lu Bei!

2805
02:03:56,080 --> 02:03:56,640
Okay.

2806
02:03:57,040 --> 02:03:57,500
That's fine.

2807
02:03:58,140 --> 02:03:59,300
As long as...

2808
02:03:59,300 --> 02:04:01,060
As long as we just beat him up.

2809
02:04:02,380 --> 02:04:03,160
Oh, oh, nice!

2810
02:04:03,320 --> 02:04:03,680
Parry!

2811
02:04:04,460 --> 02:04:04,920
There we go!

2812
02:04:05,680 --> 02:04:06,640
We're doing it!

2813
02:04:08,560 --> 02:04:09,380
This is fine!

2814
02:04:09,860 --> 02:04:11,040
I just keep... There we go!

2815
02:04:11,840 --> 02:04:13,020
I didn't parry it successfully.

2816
02:04:13,900 --> 02:04:14,780
But... Oh, nice!

2817
02:04:15,620 --> 02:04:16,620
His defense is down!

2818
02:04:18,060 --> 02:04:19,120
Keep beating him up!

2819
02:04:21,500 --> 02:04:22,660
We did it!

2820
02:04:25,400 --> 02:04:26,980
Oh my god, Lu Bei!

2821
02:04:27,260 --> 02:04:27,760
Is he alive?

2822
02:04:27,820 --> 02:04:28,920
Oh, he's alive, thank god!

2823
02:04:31,100 --> 02:04:34,500
This versus Doctor Strange is a canon event.

2824
02:04:37,960 --> 02:04:39,660
Wait, we haven't won...

2825
02:04:39,660 --> 02:04:41,640
What the fuck?!

2826
02:04:42,640 --> 02:04:43,300
What?!

2827
02:04:43,300 --> 02:04:45,280
He just fucking stabs me!

2828
02:04:45,400 --> 02:04:46,740
It's like, it's not over yet!

2829
02:04:47,160 --> 02:04:47,620
Stab!

2830
02:04:51,140 --> 02:04:53,340
The random guy that just...

2831
02:04:53,340 --> 02:04:55,640
The one guy that just stabbed me!

2832
02:05:03,840 --> 02:05:05,340
We did it!

2833
02:05:05,340 --> 02:05:07,120
Oh, thank god Lu Bei survived.

2834
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:08,660
I got a little scared there.

2835
02:05:09,680 --> 02:05:11,360
That little goblin.

2836
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:13,340
But um...

2837
02:05:14,760 --> 02:05:18,420
He stabbed me and I was like, I thought the game was over.

2838
02:05:19,740 --> 02:05:23,060
And I was used the Serpent Stance by pressing L, B, Y.

2839
02:05:23,600 --> 02:05:24,680
Oh shit, another attack.

2840
02:05:26,280 --> 02:05:30,520
And I was used the Phoenix Stance by pressing L, Y while evading.

2841
02:05:30,820 --> 02:05:32,360
L, Y while evading.

2842
02:05:32,360 --> 02:05:34,600
L, Y...

2843
02:05:34,600 --> 02:05:34,980
Okay.

2844
02:05:38,110 --> 02:05:39,100
Unlocked a new skill.

2845
02:05:39,520 --> 02:05:43,580
Wait, isn't that like a new panel for my...

2846
02:05:43,580 --> 02:05:44,240
Oh, nice.

2847
02:05:44,460 --> 02:05:44,720
Okay.

2848
02:05:45,740 --> 02:05:46,620
Yay, Walnut!

2849
02:05:48,110 --> 02:05:49,880
You're doing it, my little guy!

2850
02:05:50,560 --> 02:05:52,340
I didn't hear no bell.

2851
02:05:54,900 --> 02:05:56,280
Oh, I did!

2852
02:05:56,640 --> 02:05:57,020
Okay.

2853
02:05:57,020 --> 02:05:58,400
Okay.

2854
02:05:58,860 --> 02:05:59,580
Uh...

2855
02:05:59,580 --> 02:06:01,080
What is this?

2856
02:06:01,660 --> 02:06:02,620
Increase health?

2857
02:06:03,640 --> 02:06:06,720
Okay, boost attack strength by boost defense.

2858
02:06:08,120 --> 02:06:08,840
Okay.

2859
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:13,160
Grants bravery when evading justice.

2860
02:06:13,420 --> 02:06:14,880
Does it use both of these?

2861
02:06:14,940 --> 02:06:16,420
Or like only one of them?

2862
02:06:18,720 --> 02:06:19,440
Guys.

2863
02:06:20,180 --> 02:06:22,500
Like, it uses both of these, right?

2864
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:23,700
At the same time?

2865
02:06:24,860 --> 02:06:26,320
I just wanna be sure.

2866
02:06:27,540 --> 02:06:28,160
Both?

2867
02:06:28,260 --> 02:06:28,580
Okay.

2868
02:06:31,220 --> 02:06:31,840
Taking...

2869
02:06:31,840 --> 02:06:32,440
Okay, wait.

2870
02:06:32,640 --> 02:06:33,340
What's this?

2871
02:06:33,500 --> 02:06:34,740
What the fuck?

2872
02:06:34,760 --> 02:06:36,420
I don't even think I could do something like that.

2873
02:06:36,500 --> 02:06:36,920
That's...

2874
02:06:36,920 --> 02:06:41,480
That looks way too cool for something I can do.

2875
02:06:42,620 --> 02:06:45,260
That looks way too fucking cool.

2876
02:06:53,470 --> 02:06:54,630
I did it.

2877
02:07:00,770 --> 02:07:05,110
And it seems you've proven that you can at least survive.

2878
02:07:06,010 --> 02:07:06,350
What?

2879
02:07:07,790 --> 02:07:10,150
Lupe was definitely hanged by the thread there.

2880
02:07:12,970 --> 02:07:13,850
He was...

2881
02:07:13,850 --> 02:07:15,110
He was not doing okay.

2882
02:07:17,150 --> 02:07:18,990
Now, let me ask you.

2883
02:07:19,150 --> 02:07:22,770
Out of curiosity, what do you think of the super chat?

2884
02:07:22,950 --> 02:07:23,890
What do you think of the super chat?

2885
02:07:23,890 --> 02:07:25,650
God, I love Hack and Slash in rock and roll.

2886
02:07:25,750 --> 02:07:26,790
I love Hack and Slash.

2887
02:07:26,890 --> 02:07:27,970
I love like Ted Why is he empty?

2888
02:07:32,270 --> 02:07:34,970
Why has he been forsaken by the heavens?

2889
02:07:35,330 --> 02:07:36,170
Fallen from grace?

2890
02:07:40,810 --> 02:07:41,790
Righteousness, power.

2891
02:07:41,970 --> 02:07:42,730
I think righteousness...

2892
02:07:42,730 --> 02:07:43,350
Oh no!

2893
02:07:43,670 --> 02:07:45,690
They made him more...

2894
02:07:46,290 --> 02:07:51,650
They made him more of like an enemy that you can like sort of like be like he's just misunderstood.

2895
02:07:53,250 --> 02:07:54,050
I'll just say power.

2896
02:08:02,030 --> 02:08:03,230
I'll just say power.

2897
02:08:03,750 --> 02:08:04,830
He's weak.

2898
02:08:06,890 --> 02:08:08,990
He's a fucking hippie.

2899
02:08:18,770 --> 02:08:19,910
That's right!

2900
02:08:20,310 --> 02:08:20,910
You know what?

2901
02:08:20,970 --> 02:08:21,870
Maybe he was right.

2902
02:08:23,210 --> 02:08:24,010
Maybe don't...

2903
02:08:24,010 --> 02:08:29,370
You know, I think now that I see him in a new light and he's like a little more attractive now and not an ugly pig.

2904
02:08:29,650 --> 02:08:31,250
I think I understand him now.

2905
02:08:39,090 --> 02:08:41,050
I think he was just misunderstood.

2906
02:08:44,390 --> 02:08:45,350
Not shallow.

2907
02:08:47,070 --> 02:08:48,030
Superficial doki.

2908
02:08:48,870 --> 02:08:50,570
Maybe it wasn't so bad.

2909
02:08:57,520 --> 02:08:59,340
Oh my god!

2910
02:08:59,840 --> 02:09:01,800
How do you keep showing up?

2911
02:09:02,040 --> 02:09:03,340
Are you like...

2912
02:09:05,040 --> 02:09:06,900
Are you part of my mind?

2913
02:09:27,940 --> 02:09:29,000
Don't worry.

2914
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,800
I still have the power of freedom.

2915
02:09:36,930 --> 02:09:38,750
That's like a real thing though.

2916
02:09:39,110 --> 02:09:43,810
Apparently like it's really fucked up but like it's actually real.

2917
02:09:44,750 --> 02:09:46,810
Where like um...

2918
02:09:46,810 --> 02:09:49,410
People are more willing to agree with you if you're attractive.

2919
02:09:52,430 --> 02:09:55,550
It's fucked up but it's actually true.

2920
02:09:59,970 --> 02:10:01,370
Oh there's that...

2921
02:10:01,370 --> 02:10:02,430
Oh wait, that's the one I equip.

2922
02:10:04,250 --> 02:10:07,230
Uh... Do I need range or...

2923
02:10:07,230 --> 02:10:08,830
Boost damage dealt to enemies?

2924
02:10:08,970 --> 02:10:12,610
I feel like maybe the damage because I'm parrying a lot.

2925
02:10:13,010 --> 02:10:13,810
To be fair.

2926
02:10:14,790 --> 02:10:16,690
I'm doing a lot of parries.

2927
02:10:19,210 --> 02:10:20,690
Do I have whirlwind kick?

2928
02:10:20,750 --> 02:10:21,090
I don't.

2929
02:10:21,150 --> 02:10:21,970
I think I don't.

2930
02:10:22,750 --> 02:10:25,010
Elbow strike, palm strike, whirlwind...

2931
02:10:25,010 --> 02:10:26,290
Yeah, I don't have whirlwind kick.

2932
02:10:26,790 --> 02:10:28,370
Divine bird's wing.

2933
02:10:30,350 --> 02:10:30,680
Nah.

2934
02:10:32,990 --> 02:10:36,630
Wait, is that why people always agree with you?

2935
02:10:39,770 --> 02:10:40,430
Uh...

2936
02:10:42,150 --> 02:10:43,090
What's this?

2937
02:10:46,010 --> 02:10:47,570
Wait, is it feeding time?

2938
02:10:50,050 --> 02:10:51,450
Okay, I'm...

2939
02:10:51,450 --> 02:10:56,630
After this cutscene, I need to feed Doki Amber Doge, not Doki Amber Horse.

2940
02:11:00,500 --> 02:11:01,940
You figured it out.

2941
02:11:02,980 --> 02:11:09,060
If you followed the flow of incense here, that means you are a guardian of peace.

2942
02:11:09,760 --> 02:11:12,980
Oh, am I in the Zhenjiao route now?

2943
02:11:15,040 --> 02:11:16,000
Am I...

2944
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,300
Am I really doing peace by killing people?

2945
02:11:18,500 --> 02:11:19,960
I thought... I said that as a joke.

2946
02:11:20,220 --> 02:11:20,420
I...

2947
02:11:23,760 --> 02:11:26,640
I shall spread peace with one...

2948
02:11:26,640 --> 02:11:29,220
With one slice at a time!

2949
02:11:40,800 --> 02:11:42,400
I don't.

2950
02:11:43,720 --> 02:11:45,780
Peace through power and war.

2951
02:11:59,960 --> 02:12:01,940
A guardian of peace.

2952
02:12:02,800 --> 02:12:06,340
One who knows not their duty judges me.

2953
02:12:07,100 --> 02:12:10,600
If that is not the will of the heavens, then I am at a loss.

2954
02:12:11,820 --> 02:12:13,960
Heaven and earth try to judge me.

2955
02:12:14,980 --> 02:12:20,760
I will not stop believing in my righteousness as long as others ask it of me.

2956
02:12:21,500 --> 02:12:27,020
I know that this path, this ideal, is not a mistake.

2957
02:12:27,020 --> 02:12:30,580
And why is the heavens trying to stop you?

2958
02:12:32,400 --> 02:12:34,300
You will lose nonetheless.

2959
02:12:34,820 --> 02:12:38,400
And while your men run amok, you truly think so?

2960
02:12:38,580 --> 02:12:39,920
Now I'm gonna say he's gonna lose.

2961
02:12:40,040 --> 02:12:40,660
Nah, I win.

2962
02:12:41,060 --> 02:12:42,100
I am right.

2963
02:12:43,440 --> 02:12:45,660
And therefore, I will not lose.

2964
02:12:46,980 --> 02:12:47,820
I cannot.

2965
02:12:49,060 --> 02:12:51,360
Our fates are intertwined.

2966
02:12:52,500 --> 02:12:55,960
I shall await the day I see you in battle.

2967
02:12:56,960 --> 02:12:58,740
This is such like...

2968
02:12:58,740 --> 02:12:59,420
What's the word?

2969
02:13:00,600 --> 02:13:03,980
That entire sentence contradicts each other.

2970
02:13:05,940 --> 02:13:08,340
I am Zhang Zhao.

2971
02:13:08,940 --> 02:13:10,840
The general of heaven.

2972
02:13:12,540 --> 02:13:16,820
These two hands will upend the heavens if need be.

2973
02:13:19,630 --> 02:13:20,900
Oh, that poor guy.

2974
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:22,140
He thinks he's a god.

2975
02:13:23,320 --> 02:13:24,500
I shall...

2976
02:13:24,500 --> 02:13:28,080
I shall see you in battle, guard you in a piece.

2977
02:13:30,940 --> 02:13:31,460
Alright.

2978
02:13:32,900 --> 02:13:34,040
Let's talk to Dong Zhuo.

2979
02:13:39,480 --> 02:13:40,000
Hello.

2980
02:13:40,320 --> 02:13:41,560
Oh my god, is this his route?

2981
02:13:45,520 --> 02:13:47,200
Oh, he thinks it's hot.

2982
02:13:53,280 --> 02:13:55,240
Oh my god, the Dong route.

2983
02:14:01,820 --> 02:14:06,140
Not the Dong route.

2984
02:14:06,220 --> 02:14:07,740
Not the Dong route.

2985
02:14:08,460 --> 02:14:09,420
Oh!

2986
02:14:11,660 --> 02:14:12,800
Guys, he's a lord.

2987
02:14:21,540 --> 02:14:23,380
Oh, um...

2988
02:14:23,380 --> 02:14:24,740
Oh my god.

2989
02:14:25,480 --> 02:14:26,940
Okay, before I...

2990
02:14:26,940 --> 02:14:29,460
Before I do the Dong route, let me...

2991
02:14:29,460 --> 02:14:31,240
Let me feed my dog.

2992
02:14:35,480 --> 02:14:37,440
For you, dog.

2993
02:15:17,120 --> 02:15:17,920
Alright.

2994
02:15:19,120 --> 02:15:21,120
Badoki, what about Hong Dang?

2995
02:15:21,460 --> 02:15:22,040
Who?

2996
02:15:22,900 --> 02:15:25,020
Who are you talking about?

2997
02:15:25,120 --> 02:15:25,700
Hong who?

2998
02:15:31,220 --> 02:15:34,100
For you, Dong Zhuo.

2999
02:16:18,900 --> 02:16:21,900
Oh my god, you're so right, Lord Dong Zhuo.

3000
02:16:32,880 --> 02:16:36,480
So true, bestie.

3001
02:16:40,540 --> 02:16:43,800
According to Wikipedia, Dong tortured people in Banquets.

3002
02:16:44,120 --> 02:16:44,820
That's fake!

3003
02:16:45,060 --> 02:16:47,440
Anybody can write a Wikipedia article!

3004
02:16:48,400 --> 02:16:49,600
Look at him!

3005
02:16:50,200 --> 02:16:51,700
He would do no such wrong.

3006
02:16:53,940 --> 02:16:57,420
I bet you they... I bet you his aunties rewrote the wiki.

3007
02:17:01,980 --> 02:17:04,100
It's propaganda by his enemies.

3008
02:17:15,840 --> 02:17:16,880
I didn't...

3009
02:17:16,880 --> 02:17:18,200
I just said one thing.

3010
02:17:18,540 --> 02:17:20,620
I literally...

3011
02:17:20,620 --> 02:17:26,620
I literally listened to him like talk about himself and then he's like, alright, I'm done now.

3012
02:17:26,660 --> 02:17:27,340
You can go.

3013
02:17:30,420 --> 02:17:33,000
He's like, I'm fucking done talking to you.

3014
02:17:33,080 --> 02:17:33,760
I'm like, okay.

3015
02:17:35,160 --> 02:17:37,300
Oh, let me give you a farewell admission.

3016
02:17:37,560 --> 02:17:38,420
He likes it.

3017
02:17:38,720 --> 02:17:40,760
He likes to hear himself talk.

3018
02:17:45,760 --> 02:17:50,480
Defeat 100 enemies, cause a foe's large fort first, conquer base three times.

3019
02:17:51,480 --> 02:17:52,540
Alright, no problem.

3020
02:17:52,920 --> 02:17:53,440
Alright, Lu Bei.

3021
02:18:11,640 --> 02:18:14,680
It would be best to focus before we head into battle.

3022
02:18:15,640 --> 02:18:18,160
I for one can't help but get excited.

3023
02:18:19,120 --> 02:18:20,180
What's wrong, brother?

3024
02:18:21,420 --> 02:18:21,980
No.

3025
02:18:22,740 --> 02:18:25,840
It's just that it feels like I'm dreaming at all.

3026
02:18:26,960 --> 02:18:29,340
We started out merely wanting to help those who are suffering.

3027
02:18:30,540 --> 02:18:34,960
And now we are fighting alongside the land's finest warriors.

3028
02:18:35,880 --> 02:18:36,680
Think about that.

3029
02:18:37,700 --> 02:18:40,360
We are about to make an incredible difference in this realm.

3030
02:18:40,500 --> 02:18:44,320
Yes, you, me, you, Guan Yun, Zhang Fei, and I.

3031
02:18:44,880 --> 02:18:46,260
The fourth sworn brother.

3032
02:18:47,820 --> 02:18:52,840
I am sure that sort of talk can wait until the victory... They'll always remember there was always four.

3033
02:18:53,480 --> 02:18:54,060
Lord Sun Jian.

3034
02:18:54,580 --> 02:18:55,280
Never three.

3035
02:18:55,440 --> 02:18:57,160
Never five, but four.

3036
02:18:57,360 --> 02:19:00,300
The tales of your volunteer army's exploits have made the rounds.

3037
02:19:00,740 --> 02:19:01,500
Quite impressive.

3038
02:19:03,340 --> 02:19:03,900
Hmm.

3039
02:19:04,460 --> 02:19:06,740
Feels strange hearing that from you.

3040
02:19:08,620 --> 02:19:11,880
Friends with the Tiger of Jiangdong as well, I see.

3041
02:19:12,480 --> 02:19:14,180
Truly an army to be reckoned with.

3042
02:19:15,380 --> 02:19:17,020
The original short king.

3043
02:19:17,620 --> 02:19:21,420
But those who don't know, he was apparently five foot three.

3044
02:19:21,900 --> 02:19:22,280
Yes.

3045
02:19:22,860 --> 02:19:24,420
He is a role model to us all.

3046
02:19:25,520 --> 02:19:28,660
It all depends on the upcoming battle.

3047
02:19:29,540 --> 02:19:31,940
It will soon be time for us to depart.

3048
02:19:32,640 --> 02:19:35,300
Be sure to make your preparations by then.

3049
02:19:36,820 --> 02:19:37,700
My hero!

3050
02:19:44,910 --> 02:19:46,830
He is truly our hero.

3051
02:19:49,310 --> 02:19:51,130
Alright, let's get this.

3052
02:19:51,930 --> 02:19:53,230
Uh, recommend level six.

3053
02:19:53,330 --> 02:19:54,130
Oh, I'm level eight.

3054
02:19:55,030 --> 02:19:56,450
Avelion, thank you for the super chat.

3055
02:19:56,510 --> 02:19:57,050
Thank you.

3056
02:19:57,110 --> 02:20:02,650
Doki, the fourth sworn brother had to return to your home planet at the end of the Yellow... No, no, no.

3057
02:20:02,730 --> 02:20:06,410
I'm gonna be here for... I'm gonna be here for a while, right guys?

3058
02:20:07,170 --> 02:20:10,250
They'll remember me for thousands of years.

3059
02:20:11,590 --> 02:20:14,250
It's always been the four musketeers.

3060
02:20:14,550 --> 02:20:16,570
Not three, but four.

3061
02:20:18,210 --> 02:20:19,450
Defeat all the...

3062
02:20:19,450 --> 02:20:21,170
Wait, defeat how many?

3063
02:20:21,390 --> 02:20:23,990
Defeat all the bandit officers.

3064
02:20:24,450 --> 02:20:25,050
So...

3065
02:20:25,050 --> 02:20:26,530
One, two... Okay, over there.

3066
02:20:28,690 --> 02:20:30,950
Just like the four musketeers, guys.

3067
02:20:31,150 --> 02:20:31,950
That's me.

3068
02:20:31,950 --> 02:20:31,990
That's me.

3069
02:20:34,290 --> 02:20:35,850
Alright, let's get rid of him.

3070
02:20:37,690 --> 02:20:39,390
Oh, he also is using his fist.

3071
02:20:39,870 --> 02:20:41,530
But I have bigger fists.

3072
02:20:42,230 --> 02:20:43,310
That's fucking right.

3073
02:20:43,730 --> 02:20:45,250
My fists are stronger.

3074
02:20:46,030 --> 02:20:47,310
That's fucking right.

3075
02:20:47,690 --> 02:20:47,910
Yeah?

3076
02:20:49,630 --> 02:20:50,230
Goodbye.

3077
02:20:51,190 --> 02:20:52,950
Oh, I should get the base back too.

3078
02:20:57,850 --> 02:20:59,590
Alright, let's get rid of...

3079
02:20:59,590 --> 02:21:03,210
Capturing the base increases the more the situation becomes more favorable.

3080
02:21:03,350 --> 02:21:03,730
Oh, okay.

3081
02:21:03,970 --> 02:21:06,090
So it's better to keep capturing bases.

3082
02:21:07,570 --> 02:21:08,530
Alright, let's see.

3083
02:21:08,610 --> 02:21:09,590
And then we go...

3084
02:21:12,030 --> 02:21:13,770
Where's the other bandit officer?

3085
02:21:15,130 --> 02:21:16,370
Jesus Christ, there's two.

3086
02:21:16,530 --> 02:21:17,170
One here.

3087
02:21:18,910 --> 02:21:19,730
Okay, I'll go...

3088
02:21:20,670 --> 02:21:22,150
Go downstairs then.

3089
02:21:22,990 --> 02:21:23,610
Actually, no.

3090
02:21:23,770 --> 02:21:25,410
Left side might be easier.

3091
02:21:25,530 --> 02:21:27,690
Wait, why are they all so fucking far away?

3092
02:21:29,590 --> 02:21:30,610
Oh my god, they're all so far.

3093
02:21:30,630 --> 02:21:32,330
I'm just gonna do the left side first.

3094
02:21:34,410 --> 02:21:35,850
Unless you have to babysit your...

3095
02:21:35,850 --> 02:21:36,350
Oh, really?

3096
02:21:36,750 --> 02:21:38,310
Oh, I just gotta make them happy.

3097
02:21:39,510 --> 02:21:40,470
They'll be fine.

3098
02:21:40,850 --> 02:21:41,490
Fuck it.

3099
02:21:41,570 --> 02:21:42,290
They'll be fine.

3100
02:21:42,990 --> 02:21:45,550
There's no way the general down there is gonna die.

3101
02:21:45,630 --> 02:21:46,610
Let me check real quick.

3102
02:21:48,170 --> 02:21:49,310
Yeah, they got this.

3103
02:21:50,890 --> 02:21:52,090
I believe in them.

3104
02:21:53,210 --> 02:21:54,290
The power of friendship.

3105
02:21:58,060 --> 02:22:00,880
Alright, let's kill the big generals here first.

3106
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:01,680
The harder generals.

3107
02:22:01,920 --> 02:22:02,080
Oh.

3108
02:22:04,260 --> 02:22:05,460
Oh, they'll be fine.

3109
02:22:06,420 --> 02:22:10,480
I believe in them to survive for like a couple seconds longer.

3110
02:22:11,120 --> 02:22:12,680
Let's just kill these guys first.

3111
02:22:15,680 --> 02:22:16,160
Alright.

3112
02:22:16,460 --> 02:22:16,980
Come on.

3113
02:22:17,060 --> 02:22:17,620
Get over here.

3114
02:22:18,040 --> 02:22:18,660
I got my...

3115
02:22:18,660 --> 02:22:21,160
You think a sword is gonna beat these fists?

3116
02:22:21,900 --> 02:22:23,240
I played Marble Rivals.

3117
02:22:23,380 --> 02:22:25,640
I never played Iron Fist, but I played Marble Rivals.

3118
02:22:26,740 --> 02:22:29,680
And I think I know how it works by watching people.

3119
02:22:30,900 --> 02:22:32,340
It's almost the same.

3120
02:22:33,320 --> 02:22:39,280
I like how I'm like getting poked by like acupuncture arrows in the side, but it literally means nothing to me.

3121
02:22:40,700 --> 02:22:41,740
Alright, nice.

3122
02:22:42,600 --> 02:22:43,360
Oh, wait.

3123
02:22:43,560 --> 02:22:43,780
Nice.

3124
02:22:44,540 --> 02:22:45,760
My randoms are doing it.

3125
02:22:46,400 --> 02:22:47,800
Look, he's not even fighting back!

3126
02:22:47,860 --> 02:22:50,540
You have a sword, but he's not even fighting back.

3127
02:22:52,940 --> 02:22:53,440
Alright.

3128
02:22:53,440 --> 02:22:54,120
Nice.

3129
02:22:54,240 --> 02:22:55,400
Let me get rid of him.

3130
02:23:00,160 --> 02:23:00,400
Nice.

3131
02:23:01,900 --> 02:23:02,440
Alright.

3132
02:23:03,280 --> 02:23:05,700
Bandit chief, bandit chief, bandit deputy.

3133
02:23:06,100 --> 02:23:07,860
Wait, it's just the bandit officers.

3134
02:23:08,140 --> 02:23:09,580
Okay, so...

3135
02:23:09,580 --> 02:23:10,400
Oh, that'll be fine.

3136
02:23:10,540 --> 02:23:11,940
We have a sure victory now.

3137
02:23:12,540 --> 02:23:13,260
The advisor?

3138
02:23:13,420 --> 02:23:16,200
Who the fuck sent in the advisor to fight?

3139
02:23:16,860 --> 02:23:17,660
What the fuck?

3140
02:23:17,720 --> 02:23:18,760
That guy's a nerd!

3141
02:23:19,380 --> 02:23:20,520
That poor nerd!

3142
02:23:20,840 --> 02:23:21,460
I'm beating...

3143
02:23:21,460 --> 02:23:22,680
I'm gonna stuff him in the locker!

3144
02:23:26,360 --> 02:23:27,400
That's right.

3145
02:23:30,780 --> 02:23:31,640
Poor guy.

3146
02:23:33,580 --> 02:23:35,240
He got stuffed in the locker.

3147
02:23:36,080 --> 02:23:37,020
That poor guy.

3148
02:23:37,760 --> 02:23:38,800
I don't know why...

3149
02:23:38,800 --> 02:23:41,520
I don't know who brought you in here.

3150
02:23:42,880 --> 02:23:46,600
I was not the one that brought him to the battlefield.

3151
02:23:47,300 --> 02:23:49,360
I don't know... Oh my god, another one.

3152
02:23:49,360 --> 02:23:51,120
I'm gonna kick this nerd's ass.

3153
02:23:51,680 --> 02:23:53,700
You're in the wrong war, nerd!

3154
02:23:54,160 --> 02:23:55,320
Get back in your tent!

3155
02:23:56,160 --> 02:23:57,620
I don't know why you're here!

3156
02:23:58,340 --> 02:24:00,340
Get back in that tent, boy!

3157
02:24:03,640 --> 02:24:06,040
Let's get the assault right here first.

3158
02:24:08,060 --> 02:24:10,140
He's trying his best!

3159
02:24:11,240 --> 02:24:12,740
He made a mistake!

3160
02:24:14,100 --> 02:24:14,940
That's right!

3161
02:24:15,140 --> 02:24:15,880
You see that, nerd?

3162
02:24:16,180 --> 02:24:17,660
That's gonna happen to you!

3163
02:24:20,100 --> 02:24:20,820
That's right!

3164
02:24:21,280 --> 02:24:22,120
Get over here.

3165
02:24:23,720 --> 02:24:24,420
All my might!

3166
02:24:24,520 --> 02:24:25,520
Not even gonna...

3167
02:24:25,520 --> 02:24:27,120
I'm not even gonna go easy.

3168
02:24:29,040 --> 02:24:29,520
Alright.

3169
02:24:30,100 --> 02:24:31,040
Get him out too.

3170
02:24:33,140 --> 02:24:34,100
Jesus Christ.

3171
02:24:34,880 --> 02:24:35,740
I need to make sure.

3172
02:24:36,560 --> 02:24:37,020
Come on.

3173
02:24:37,900 --> 02:24:39,860
Oh, that's not who I'm trying to fight!

3174
02:24:40,120 --> 02:24:40,580
No!

3175
02:24:42,580 --> 02:24:43,920
That's fine, that's fine, that's fine.

3176
02:24:43,980 --> 02:24:44,980
He's almost dead anyway.

3177
02:24:46,480 --> 02:24:47,160
Oh my god.

3178
02:24:47,260 --> 02:24:48,240
This is actually so annoying.

3179
02:24:48,900 --> 02:24:51,400
This like 1v2 is so fucking annoying.

3180
02:24:51,900 --> 02:24:52,720
I hate it.

3181
02:24:53,840 --> 02:24:58,540
Your feats paved the way for allied supremacy, even without raising morale is enough.

3182
02:24:58,640 --> 02:24:59,080
Oh, okay.

3183
02:25:00,800 --> 02:25:02,160
It's automatic victory now.

3184
02:25:03,260 --> 02:25:03,740
You see that?

3185
02:25:03,800 --> 02:25:04,160
You're next.

3186
02:25:04,220 --> 02:25:04,620
Exactly.

3187
02:25:04,740 --> 02:25:05,160
You see that?

3188
02:25:05,600 --> 02:25:06,640
You see what happened to you?

3189
02:25:06,860 --> 02:25:07,620
You're fucking next!

3190
02:25:08,300 --> 02:25:09,080
That's right, nerd!

3191
02:25:09,220 --> 02:25:10,680
I'm gonna pull your underwear up your head!

3192
02:25:10,680 --> 02:25:11,520
Take this!

3193
02:25:12,740 --> 02:25:14,840
You might as well be a nerd to me.

3194
02:25:15,040 --> 02:25:17,140
The enemy officer has been defeated.

3195
02:25:18,480 --> 02:25:21,060
Where are the other bandit chiefs?

3196
02:25:21,200 --> 02:25:22,820
Bandit deputy, bandit...

3197
02:25:22,820 --> 02:25:24,160
I'll ride up.

3198
02:25:26,360 --> 02:25:27,860
Alright, we go up now.

3199
02:25:29,480 --> 02:25:30,840
We have to save...

3200
02:25:30,840 --> 02:25:32,480
Well, apparently it's like...

3201
02:25:32,480 --> 02:25:35,240
We already win, but I still have to kill everybody.

3202
02:25:35,880 --> 02:25:37,000
Let's dash faster.

3203
02:25:39,480 --> 02:25:40,760
Come on, Walnut!

3204
02:25:41,100 --> 02:25:41,660
Giddy up!

3205
02:25:42,300 --> 02:25:43,620
Giddy up, my little guy!

3206
02:25:44,280 --> 02:25:45,900
Come on, you got this!

3207
02:25:47,220 --> 02:25:48,060
Which one?

3208
02:25:48,240 --> 02:25:48,800
This one?

3209
02:25:49,160 --> 02:25:50,340
Oh shit, you are.

3210
02:25:50,860 --> 02:25:52,080
Don't worry, I'm here now.

3211
02:25:52,220 --> 02:25:52,400
See?

3212
02:25:52,600 --> 02:25:53,460
Good for you.

3213
02:25:54,340 --> 02:25:56,840
I don't know how you almost died there, but good for you.

3214
02:26:00,340 --> 02:26:00,860
Alright.

3215
02:26:01,200 --> 02:26:02,660
Let's grab this base back.

3216
02:26:02,840 --> 02:26:04,580
Oh wait, another general showed up.

3217
02:26:04,580 --> 02:26:07,240
Oh my god, the nerd went to the fight too?

3218
02:26:08,560 --> 02:26:10,800
Who keeps putting all these nerds into this fight?

3219
02:26:13,380 --> 02:26:14,260
Okay, parry.

3220
02:26:14,860 --> 02:26:15,860
Oh, fuck this.

3221
02:26:16,480 --> 02:26:18,160
I know they're nobodies, but who cares?

3222
02:26:20,760 --> 02:26:23,000
The enemy officer has been defeated.

3223
02:26:26,780 --> 02:26:29,540
There's not enough lockers to stuff all these nerds in.

3224
02:26:31,320 --> 02:26:34,560
Who let this one...

3225
02:26:35,500 --> 02:26:36,080
Okay.

3226
02:26:37,340 --> 02:26:39,160
Alright, we should own this now.

3227
02:26:40,220 --> 02:26:41,880
Whoops, I did not mean to eat a bun.

3228
02:26:44,860 --> 02:26:45,440
Alright.

3229
02:26:46,360 --> 02:26:48,000
There's two more deputies.

3230
02:26:48,460 --> 02:26:54,340
Okay, this fucking accessory better be worth it because this is a long ass...

3231
02:26:54,340 --> 02:26:56,940
This is a long ass side mission.

3232
02:26:59,440 --> 02:27:05,920
I swear to god, if this is a dog shit accessory that I'm not even gonna equip, I will be very sad.

3233
02:27:08,360 --> 02:27:10,280
Oh my god, there's so many.

3234
02:27:10,840 --> 02:27:14,680
There's too many big people that I have to get rid of.

3235
02:27:15,320 --> 02:27:16,260
Okay, nice.

3236
02:27:16,780 --> 02:27:18,080
I have extra damage.

3237
02:27:19,300 --> 02:27:20,740
The enemy courage has...

3238
02:27:20,740 --> 02:27:21,620
Did we win automatically?

3239
02:27:22,520 --> 02:27:23,540
At this point?

3240
02:27:25,080 --> 02:27:26,640
They don't even have courage.

3241
02:27:27,240 --> 02:27:29,500
Oh, they don't even fight back anymore!

3242
02:27:30,520 --> 02:27:32,640
Guess they lacked all courage.

3243
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:34,640
Nice.

3244
02:27:39,580 --> 02:27:40,860
And then...

3245
02:27:40,860 --> 02:27:44,020
Gotta go downstairs for the last fight.

3246
02:27:45,660 --> 02:27:47,340
Yeah, they lost all their HP.

3247
02:27:47,980 --> 02:27:50,100
I don't think I like this mission.

3248
02:27:50,460 --> 02:27:58,660
This one definitely feels like it drags on for way too long for how easy it is to beat.

3249
02:28:00,880 --> 02:28:08,040
I basically beat this mission within the first two fights, but I still have to finish it.

3250
02:28:11,040 --> 02:28:14,100
This seems like an incredibly long side mission.

3251
02:28:16,680 --> 02:28:17,960
Let's dash up here.

3252
02:28:20,440 --> 02:28:21,860
Yeah, the map is too big.

3253
02:28:21,920 --> 02:28:22,940
It should've definitely been shorter.

3254
02:28:23,760 --> 02:28:24,600
Alright, now eat your bun.

3255
02:28:24,660 --> 02:28:25,240
I'm here now.

3256
02:28:26,060 --> 02:28:27,040
Eat your bun!

3257
02:28:28,700 --> 02:28:30,220
Nate, thank you for the super chat!

3258
02:28:30,280 --> 02:28:30,520
Thank you!

3259
02:28:30,880 --> 02:28:31,320
Thank you!

3260
02:28:32,560 --> 02:28:33,980
Okay, that should be everybody.

3261
02:28:34,540 --> 02:28:34,860
Yay!

3262
02:28:38,640 --> 02:28:39,120
Yay!

3263
02:28:42,040 --> 02:28:43,560
Is this a tutorial?

3264
02:28:45,200 --> 02:28:50,660
I guess it teaches you the tutorial about the morale and courage, but I feel like a little too late.

3265
02:28:51,240 --> 02:28:52,340
I don't know.

3266
02:28:52,420 --> 02:28:55,340
It feels like a little too late to teach me about...

3267
02:28:55,340 --> 02:28:56,220
teach me that.

3268
02:28:57,880 --> 02:28:59,280
Means press 31.

3269
02:29:00,780 --> 02:29:03,320
I wanna level up all of this first.

3270
02:29:03,680 --> 02:29:04,780
What can my horse do now?

3271
02:29:06,220 --> 02:29:07,180
Spur on...

3272
02:29:07,760 --> 02:29:09,960
Encourage replenishing some...

3273
02:29:09,960 --> 02:29:10,740
Okay.

3274
02:29:14,970 --> 02:29:17,750
This is why you don't send your advisors to battle.

3275
02:29:19,510 --> 02:29:21,470
Gauntlet of Dispersion.

3276
02:29:21,670 --> 02:29:22,550
What is that?

3277
02:29:27,880 --> 02:29:29,080
Is this gonna stop?

3278
02:29:29,580 --> 02:29:31,520
I feel like I parry.

3279
02:29:36,020 --> 02:29:40,440
Successfully stop an enemy attack with special arts.

3280
02:29:40,480 --> 02:29:43,720
I do that a lot too, but I don't know.

3281
02:29:44,620 --> 02:29:45,300
I think I'll wait.

3282
02:29:45,420 --> 02:29:49,720
I'm gonna wait until I unlock a second one first before I do that.

3283
02:29:51,600 --> 02:29:53,960
No, I don't think it is a parry buff.

3284
02:29:53,960 --> 02:29:55,860
I think it's like...

3285
02:29:56,940 --> 02:29:59,260
I mean, it's not really parry.

3286
02:29:59,320 --> 02:30:00,300
It's your special arts.

3287
02:30:00,380 --> 02:30:01,340
It's my special ability.

3288
02:30:09,410 --> 02:30:10,550
Alright, this one.

3289
02:30:12,590 --> 02:30:13,230
The yellow...

3290
02:30:13,230 --> 02:30:15,630
Final battle against the yellow turbans.

3291
02:30:16,330 --> 02:30:17,270
Alright, here we go.

3292
02:30:17,850 --> 02:30:20,390
We're finally gonna kill the hippie.

3293
02:30:21,990 --> 02:30:23,210
The cult leader.

3294
02:30:27,700 --> 02:30:28,300
Alright...

3295
02:30:28,300 --> 02:30:29,560
I just...

3296
02:30:29,560 --> 02:30:30,940
Please tell me he grows a mustache.

3297
02:30:32,260 --> 02:30:32,860
Please...

3298
02:30:32,860 --> 02:30:34,940
Tell me Chao Chao grows a...

3299
02:30:34,940 --> 02:30:36,000
That's all I want.

3300
02:30:36,480 --> 02:30:39,360
I just want him to have a mustache.

3301
02:30:40,460 --> 02:30:41,940
It's so weird.

3302
02:30:42,100 --> 02:30:43,160
It's so...

3303
02:30:44,100 --> 02:30:46,480
It's so weird seeing him...

3304
02:30:47,160 --> 02:30:49,920
It's like he's bald, but like worse.

3305
02:30:49,920 --> 02:30:50,140
It's...

3306
02:30:51,940 --> 02:30:53,340
Okay,

3307
02:31:02,580 --> 02:31:04,500
they can't die.

3308
02:31:13,140 --> 02:31:13,860
Yeah.

3309
02:31:15,660 --> 02:31:16,380
Alright,

3310
02:31:25,500 --> 02:31:26,000
so...

3311
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:27,560
I'm gonna take the castle first.

3312
02:31:27,800 --> 02:31:30,500
And then, after that...

3313
02:31:31,280 --> 02:31:31,720
Uh...

3314
02:31:32,240 --> 02:31:34,320
I'm gonna simply wait for the right moment to finish the fight.

3315
02:31:34,680 --> 02:31:35,540
You do understand.

3316
02:31:36,540 --> 02:31:39,900
The volunteer army will be... You should read the situation and take what you believe to be best course.

3317
02:31:39,960 --> 02:31:41,800
Yeah, I'm gonna follow the mobile army.

3318
02:31:42,780 --> 02:31:44,760
History says bye to DLC.

3319
02:31:45,120 --> 02:31:48,240
They lock the mustache in the DLC pack.

3320
02:31:48,340 --> 02:31:49,800
Imagine if they actually do that.

3321
02:31:49,900 --> 02:31:52,060
That would be so fucked if they locked that.

3322
02:31:56,760 --> 02:32:00,080
Yeah, I'm ready.

3323
02:32:00,080 --> 02:32:00,100
I'm ready.

3324
02:32:01,580 --> 02:32:02,860
It's just weird.

3325
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:06,080
If he feels naked without his mustache...

3326
02:32:09,460 --> 02:32:11,060
It feels like he's just...

3327
02:32:11,060 --> 02:32:13,200
He's a cosplayer, but like...

3328
02:32:13,200 --> 02:32:16,860
Did like 80-70% of the effort of cosplaying him.

3329
02:32:20,360 --> 02:32:22,420
He's the same age as Sun Jian!

3330
02:32:22,620 --> 02:32:23,460
I don't understand!

3331
02:32:23,460 --> 02:32:23,800
Sun Jian!

3332
02:32:26,460 --> 02:32:28,020
He just has... I guess...

3333
02:32:28,020 --> 02:32:29,860
I guess his life force just got drained.

3334
02:32:39,200 --> 02:32:41,600
Like, I feel like I'm starting a K-pop group.

3335
02:32:44,420 --> 02:32:45,260
It's like...

3336
02:32:45,260 --> 02:32:48,900
The American dad...

3337
02:32:49,280 --> 02:32:51,260
Boy band...

3338
02:32:53,460 --> 02:32:53,940
Some of it again.

3339
02:33:04,060 --> 02:33:04,780
B-12.

3340
02:33:04,960 --> 02:33:05,340
I think...

3341
02:33:05,340 --> 02:33:07,640
I feel like this is B-12 right now.

3342
02:33:07,700 --> 02:33:08,460
I'm B-12.

3343
02:33:08,720 --> 02:33:14,240
I feel like this is...

3344
02:33:14,240 --> 02:33:15,680
I'm just starting my...

3345
02:33:17,040 --> 02:33:20,560
The ancient China B-12 group.

3346
02:33:22,500 --> 02:33:24,140
Wait, how do I get to the top?

3347
02:33:26,820 --> 02:33:27,300
Wow.

3348
02:33:27,780 --> 02:33:29,220
Wait, how do I get up there?

3349
02:33:33,260 --> 02:33:33,740
Wait,

3350
02:33:37,400 --> 02:33:38,420
how do I get up there?

3351
02:33:38,480 --> 02:33:39,740
I thought I was gonna get up there.

3352
02:33:40,920 --> 02:33:41,600
I'm not.

3353
02:33:44,900 --> 02:33:47,000
I thought I could get up there!

3354
02:33:47,700 --> 02:33:48,880
I don't know how!

3355
02:33:50,620 --> 02:33:51,440
Oh, okay.

3356
02:33:51,500 --> 02:33:52,040
I do now.

3357
02:33:52,040 --> 02:33:53,520
Guys, I found the ladder.

3358
02:33:58,080 --> 02:34:01,980
Okay, I figured it out.

3359
02:34:02,340 --> 02:34:03,520
Okay, not really.

3360
02:34:03,680 --> 02:34:04,320
I am...

3361
02:34:04,320 --> 02:34:05,920
I am a little lost.

3362
02:34:07,120 --> 02:34:08,420
How the fuck?

3363
02:34:13,940 --> 02:34:15,680
Oh, he's dispatching soldiers.

3364
02:34:15,900 --> 02:34:18,460
I hope people don't die while I'm being lost.

3365
02:34:19,040 --> 02:34:19,340
I...

3366
02:34:20,580 --> 02:34:21,540
I am...

3367
02:34:21,540 --> 02:34:22,700
Oh, no.

3368
02:34:23,160 --> 02:34:24,620
I am a little lost.

3369
02:34:24,680 --> 02:34:26,060
I'm sorry, team.

3370
02:34:29,810 --> 02:34:30,250
Okay.

3371
02:34:30,570 --> 02:34:32,250
Oh, I almost got off the bridge.

3372
02:34:32,350 --> 02:34:32,750
I'm okay.

3373
02:34:32,850 --> 02:34:33,250
I'm okay.

3374
02:34:37,910 --> 02:34:40,950
Oh, no.

3375
02:34:46,330 --> 02:34:47,390
It'll be fine.

3376
02:34:48,750 --> 02:34:50,050
I'm here to help!

3377
02:34:51,470 --> 02:34:52,430
That's right!

3378
02:34:54,790 --> 02:34:56,090
I know you... Oh, wait.

3379
02:34:56,150 --> 02:34:57,410
They were doing okay.

3380
02:34:57,730 --> 02:34:58,530
They didn't need me.

3381
02:34:58,610 --> 02:35:00,150
But I'm still here to help!

3382
02:35:00,890 --> 02:35:03,450
I know you guys didn't need me, but don't worry.

3383
02:35:03,550 --> 02:35:04,990
The hero is here.

3384
02:35:07,530 --> 02:35:09,270
Okay, maybe I went the wrong way.

3385
02:35:12,250 --> 02:35:13,150
No, no.

3386
02:35:13,410 --> 02:35:14,890
I know what I'm doing.

3387
02:35:18,210 --> 02:35:19,810
Okay, I go here.

3388
02:35:23,770 --> 02:35:25,470
Oh, I should have been following the reserve.

3389
02:35:26,170 --> 02:35:26,550
Whoops.

3390
02:35:28,030 --> 02:35:28,950
That's okay.

3391
02:35:31,690 --> 02:35:32,510
Don't worry.

3392
02:35:33,130 --> 02:35:34,670
I'm getting... I got the back.

3393
02:35:35,950 --> 02:35:37,910
I got the back shots.

3394
02:35:38,010 --> 02:35:38,710
Don't worry.

3395
02:35:39,230 --> 02:35:40,130
We're so ready.

3396
02:35:41,350 --> 02:35:42,710
They don't know I'm here.

3397
02:35:42,710 --> 02:35:42,790
They don't know I'm here.

3398
02:35:45,790 --> 02:35:46,850
That's right!

3399
02:35:47,790 --> 02:35:50,050
They never expect a back.

3400
02:35:50,930 --> 02:35:51,590
Wait, what?

3401
02:35:52,430 --> 02:35:53,370
Oh, I got them!

3402
02:35:53,550 --> 02:35:54,750
Oh, it's the ambush buff.

3403
02:35:59,590 --> 02:36:00,910
That's fucking right.

3404
02:36:01,390 --> 02:36:03,330
I got the ambush buff right here.

3405
02:36:03,850 --> 02:36:05,270
Oh, they're scared now.

3406
02:36:05,610 --> 02:36:06,630
They're so scared!

3407
02:36:10,150 --> 02:36:12,690
None of them ever expects the...

3408
02:36:12,690 --> 02:36:15,330
No one ever expects the back.

3409
02:36:22,890 --> 02:36:23,690
Nice.

3410
02:36:25,330 --> 02:36:27,050
Oh, that's right!

3411
02:36:27,710 --> 02:36:30,570
All of China is here to get rid of you hippies!

3412
02:36:31,050 --> 02:36:32,470
That's fucking right!

3413
02:36:34,650 --> 02:36:35,210
That's right!

3414
02:36:35,210 --> 02:36:35,930
Alright, let's go.

3415
02:36:36,830 --> 02:36:38,090
They're gonna go up here.

3416
02:36:44,150 --> 02:36:48,730
No one expects the shots from the back.

3417
02:36:49,330 --> 02:36:50,550
Oh, what the fuck?

3418
02:36:52,550 --> 02:36:53,430
Oh, shit.

3419
02:36:54,010 --> 02:36:55,610
Don't worry, Guan Yu, I got you!

3420
02:36:56,150 --> 02:36:56,790
Don't worry!

3421
02:36:58,370 --> 02:36:58,970
Don't worry!

3422
02:36:58,970 --> 02:37:01,250
Your hat's fucking ugly!

3423
02:37:05,270 --> 02:37:06,270
That's right!

3424
02:37:06,870 --> 02:37:09,010
I'm gonna kill you with your own hands!

3425
02:37:09,310 --> 02:37:10,510
You see these fists?

3426
02:37:10,750 --> 02:37:12,070
Those were your arms!

3427
02:37:14,010 --> 02:37:15,490
That's fucking right!

3428
02:37:17,810 --> 02:37:19,430
I got your hands!

3429
02:37:20,190 --> 02:37:21,290
I got your hands!

3430
02:37:22,590 --> 02:37:23,610
Okay, nice.

3431
02:37:24,430 --> 02:37:24,970
Oh, shit.

3432
02:37:29,170 --> 02:37:29,910
Oh, shit!

3433
02:37:29,990 --> 02:37:30,390
I got the parry!

3434
02:37:31,670 --> 02:37:32,630
That's fucking right!

3435
02:37:32,750 --> 02:37:33,330
I got the parry!

3436
02:37:34,010 --> 02:37:35,450
You have no more armor!

3437
02:37:37,750 --> 02:37:39,190
Stop hitting yourself!

3438
02:37:42,790 --> 02:37:44,130
I missed the parry.

3439
02:37:44,230 --> 02:37:44,890
God damn it.

3440
02:37:45,450 --> 02:37:46,230
I fucked it up.

3441
02:37:46,370 --> 02:37:48,630
Oh, he fucking recharged it too!

3442
02:37:49,370 --> 02:37:50,490
That should be illegal.

3443
02:37:51,770 --> 02:37:54,490
You shouldn't be allowed to recharge your hands like that.

3444
02:37:55,770 --> 02:37:56,730
Okay, parry.

3445
02:37:57,690 --> 02:37:59,110
Don't worry, I got more.

3446
02:38:03,310 --> 02:38:04,190
That's right!

3447
02:38:07,490 --> 02:38:07,790
Goodbye!

3448
02:38:08,470 --> 02:38:09,830
Now I have two of your hands!

3449
02:38:13,110 --> 02:38:14,750
That's goddamn right!

3450
02:38:15,630 --> 02:38:17,790
Now I steal all your hands!

3451
02:38:20,730 --> 02:38:22,030
Alright, we go this way.

3452
02:38:23,590 --> 02:38:25,750
Ancient Chinese Wolverine.

3453
02:38:25,870 --> 02:38:27,370
No, it's literally Iron Fist.

3454
02:38:32,640 --> 02:38:36,180
I beat him with his old hands and then took his new hands.

3455
02:38:37,360 --> 02:38:38,780
And then I'm gonna take his wife too.

3456
02:38:39,080 --> 02:38:39,640
I'm sorry.

3457
02:38:44,680 --> 02:38:47,320
Find out where your wife is!

3458
02:38:51,400 --> 02:38:52,660
Oh my god!

3459
02:38:52,820 --> 02:38:53,500
So cute!

3460
02:38:55,400 --> 02:38:57,480
And the kids too.

3461
02:38:58,700 --> 02:39:00,000
That's right.

3462
02:39:02,320 --> 02:39:03,100
Please!

3463
02:39:04,340 --> 02:39:05,120
Please!

3464
02:39:05,240 --> 02:39:07,560
You already took everything he loves!

3465
02:39:09,440 --> 02:39:11,820
How much more do you want?

3466
02:39:11,900 --> 02:39:12,740
I want everything.

3467
02:39:13,440 --> 02:39:17,760
I wanna make sure he knows he lost everything from me.

3468
02:39:23,600 --> 02:39:25,100
Alright, let's get rid of this old man.

3469
02:39:28,780 --> 02:39:29,560
Get out of here.

3470
02:39:30,640 --> 02:39:31,940
Get your ass out of here.

3471
02:39:32,980 --> 02:39:34,720
You're too old to be fighting still.

3472
02:39:34,940 --> 02:39:35,380
Get out!

3473
02:39:36,620 --> 02:39:37,320
That's right!

3474
02:39:37,860 --> 02:39:38,820
Talk to this hand.

3475
02:39:42,260 --> 02:39:43,240
Alright, let's see.

3476
02:39:43,320 --> 02:39:44,480
Where do I go now?

3477
02:39:45,420 --> 02:39:46,280
Do I help him?

3478
02:39:46,380 --> 02:39:47,580
Oh my god, there's He-Man again.

3479
02:39:48,100 --> 02:39:48,740
It's him again.

3480
02:39:50,920 --> 02:39:54,040
I'm trying to figure out where to go to help.

3481
02:40:01,420 --> 02:40:04,740
Oh no, we're thinking about...

3482
02:40:07,620 --> 02:40:10,960
It's like foreshadowing Dong Zhuo now.

3483
02:40:13,120 --> 02:40:14,140
Go away, freedom!

3484
02:40:14,940 --> 02:40:15,640
Ah!

3485
02:40:19,600 --> 02:40:22,320
Okay, you gotta sound less pathetic, buddy.

3486
02:40:22,520 --> 02:40:23,600
You really...

3487
02:40:23,600 --> 02:40:28,640
You really need to sound a little less pathetic, buddy.

3488
02:40:29,460 --> 02:40:30,770
I'm a little...

3489
02:40:31,300 --> 02:40:36,700
Oh man, no wonder you're... You know, I sort of understand why you're...

3490
02:40:36,700 --> 02:40:38,780
Someone noticed me!

3491
02:40:39,620 --> 02:40:41,140
Oh my god!

3492
02:40:41,700 --> 02:40:42,800
Bro, buddy!

3493
02:40:43,320 --> 02:40:44,620
Buddy, please!

3494
02:40:44,760 --> 02:40:46,940
Be a little less pathetic, buddy!

3495
02:40:49,480 --> 02:40:52,520
History will remember Hong Dang!

3496
02:40:52,960 --> 02:40:54,320
Guys, don't worry!

3497
02:40:54,440 --> 02:40:56,180
History's gonna remember him!

3498
02:41:02,320 --> 02:41:04,340
Alright, where's the last guy?

3499
02:41:04,600 --> 02:41:05,720
Alright, the last guy.

3500
02:41:05,920 --> 02:41:06,980
Or second last guy.

3501
02:41:10,320 --> 02:41:12,280
Alright, we got him out too.

3502
02:41:14,740 --> 02:41:16,060
And then...

3503
02:41:16,060 --> 02:41:18,160
Last last last guy, for real.

3504
02:41:18,800 --> 02:41:20,080
No, I can't be bothered.

3505
02:41:20,600 --> 02:41:22,900
You're just gonna get a full Musou attack.

3506
02:41:23,400 --> 02:41:26,260
It only does 185?!

3507
02:41:26,840 --> 02:41:28,220
Like, what's the point?!

3508
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:32,880
Oh no.

3509
02:41:33,500 --> 02:41:35,280
Oh no, they're gonna use magic again.

3510
02:41:36,180 --> 02:41:38,360
Oh no, give me a sec.

3511
02:41:41,260 --> 02:41:43,640
Wait, why won't it let me...

3512
02:41:43,640 --> 02:41:43,900
Hello?

3513
02:41:44,900 --> 02:41:46,460
Oh, okay, I was gonna say.

3514
02:41:49,460 --> 02:41:50,880
God damn it!

3515
02:41:53,300 --> 02:41:54,500
Wait, what?

3516
02:41:55,580 --> 02:41:58,320
Launch a fierce attack with phantom soldiers?

3517
02:41:58,900 --> 02:42:00,700
Find and defeat Chen Jiang?

3518
02:42:01,200 --> 02:42:01,680
Where?

3519
02:42:02,140 --> 02:42:03,340
Up there?

3520
02:42:05,540 --> 02:42:06,400
Wait, what?

3521
02:42:10,630 --> 02:42:12,510
Wait, I'm not there yet!

3522
02:42:13,710 --> 02:42:14,810
Oh no!

3523
02:42:15,730 --> 02:42:16,630
Oh no!

3524
02:42:17,510 --> 02:42:18,650
Give me a sec!

3525
02:42:18,710 --> 02:42:20,410
I'm not even there!

3526
02:42:22,670 --> 02:42:23,690
Oh, I found him.

3527
02:42:24,230 --> 02:42:24,790
Oh, okay.

3528
02:42:25,190 --> 02:42:25,910
I did it.

3529
02:42:26,230 --> 02:42:26,870
Nevermind.

3530
02:42:27,370 --> 02:42:28,450
He's right here.

3531
02:42:30,850 --> 02:42:31,490
He's...

3532
02:42:32,830 --> 02:42:34,110
Okay, alright.

3533
02:42:34,430 --> 02:42:35,150
That's fine.

3534
02:42:35,490 --> 02:42:37,070
That was just that easy.

3535
02:42:37,590 --> 02:42:40,090
He was just right there, guys.

3536
02:42:40,090 --> 02:42:41,430
He was actually...

3537
02:42:42,610 --> 02:42:43,930
Oh, you were just there.

3538
02:42:43,990 --> 02:42:44,530
Thank God.

3539
02:42:46,990 --> 02:42:47,730
Alright, thank God.

3540
02:42:47,790 --> 02:42:48,510
I don't have to do much.

3541
02:42:49,210 --> 02:42:50,090
It just works.

3542
02:42:50,150 --> 02:42:51,630
He was literally just in front of me.

3543
02:42:53,890 --> 02:42:54,250
Okay.

3544
02:42:55,110 --> 02:42:56,290
So we just gotta defeat him.

3545
02:42:56,570 --> 02:42:59,790
I like how the phantom soldiers is just like, Yeah, you go there, boss!

3546
02:43:00,010 --> 02:43:01,330
You got this, boss!

3547
02:43:01,450 --> 02:43:03,050
And then he's just...

3548
02:43:04,550 --> 02:43:05,870
You don't need our help!

3549
02:43:05,870 --> 02:43:06,750
You go!

3550
02:43:07,790 --> 02:43:09,270
Go do your thing, boss!

3551
02:43:10,850 --> 02:43:13,290
It all works out.

3552
02:43:14,990 --> 02:43:16,470
Wait, what might...

3553
02:43:16,470 --> 02:43:17,210
Which one?

3554
02:43:18,090 --> 02:43:19,050
You got this!

3555
02:43:20,090 --> 02:43:24,290
I know we were supposed to be your bodyguard, but like, I believe in you.

3556
02:43:26,790 --> 02:43:28,350
Catch those hands!

3557
02:43:30,490 --> 02:43:31,150
Nice.

3558
02:43:35,870 --> 02:43:36,370
Real support.

3559
02:43:36,550 --> 02:43:37,170
We did it.

3560
02:43:39,350 --> 02:43:40,610
Oh shit, where?

3561
02:43:42,750 --> 02:43:43,730
Wait, they're all dead.

3562
02:43:43,830 --> 02:43:44,470
No, you're fine.

3563
02:43:50,190 --> 02:43:51,590
Oh my God, finally.

3564
02:43:51,770 --> 02:43:52,270
He's dead.

3565
02:43:55,490 --> 02:43:56,430
Our commanders are...

3566
02:43:56,430 --> 02:43:59,970
They were struggling against nearly ghosts.

3567
02:44:02,610 --> 02:44:03,130
Nice.

3568
02:44:03,350 --> 02:44:04,350
I did it.

3569
02:44:06,790 --> 02:44:08,810
Oh shit, you gotta eat some bread, Tao Tao.

3570
02:44:11,570 --> 02:44:12,490
It's time.

3571
02:44:13,150 --> 02:44:14,050
Are you guys ready?

3572
02:44:17,870 --> 02:44:18,790
For Doki!

3573
02:44:25,360 --> 02:44:26,240
Let's go!

3574
02:44:27,260 --> 02:44:28,720
And then we get off the horse.

3575
02:44:30,960 --> 02:44:31,480
Charge!

3576
02:44:35,620 --> 02:44:36,340
That's fucking right.

3577
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:40,360
Oh, I should have used that.

3578
02:44:40,540 --> 02:44:42,400
Oh my God, there he goes.

3579
02:44:42,720 --> 02:44:43,880
There he goes.

3580
02:44:44,760 --> 02:44:45,280
How?

3581
02:44:45,500 --> 02:44:47,040
Who is inspiring you?

3582
02:44:47,560 --> 02:44:48,600
I killed his brother!

3583
02:44:51,040 --> 02:44:51,280
Okay.

3584
02:44:53,280 --> 02:44:54,620
Alright, we gotta kill them right here.

3585
02:44:55,720 --> 02:44:56,540
Nice, we blocked.

3586
02:44:59,080 --> 02:44:59,600
My...

3587
02:44:59,980 --> 02:45:00,780
That's fucking right.

3588
02:45:00,780 --> 02:45:02,440
I got the Y.

3589
02:45:02,680 --> 02:45:03,900
It's Y assault time.

3590
02:45:04,380 --> 02:45:05,500
Get that.

3591
02:45:06,220 --> 02:45:07,120
Get over here.

3592
02:45:08,660 --> 02:45:10,400
Jesus Christ.

3593
02:45:10,560 --> 02:45:12,220
They're all so tanky.

3594
02:45:16,700 --> 02:45:18,360
Oh my God.

3595
02:45:18,800 --> 02:45:19,540
What?

3596
02:45:21,140 --> 02:45:22,100
Bale of mist.

3597
02:45:23,120 --> 02:45:24,260
Oh no.

3598
02:45:26,700 --> 02:45:27,680
Oh no.

3599
02:45:27,680 --> 02:45:28,720
Bale of mist vanished.

3600
02:45:29,620 --> 02:45:31,040
Destroy the scent.

3601
02:45:31,400 --> 02:45:32,480
Are you serious?

3602
02:45:32,600 --> 02:45:33,760
They're all gone?

3603
02:45:37,720 --> 02:45:38,440
Where?

3604
02:45:41,440 --> 02:45:42,640
I'm so confused.

3605
02:45:42,980 --> 02:45:44,700
I'm so confused.

3606
02:45:45,060 --> 02:45:46,020
Where are they?

3607
02:45:48,780 --> 02:45:49,500
What?

3608
02:45:52,640 --> 02:45:53,760
Where is it?

3609
02:45:53,800 --> 02:45:54,560
Oh, there's over there.

3610
02:45:55,020 --> 02:45:55,900
It's over there.

3611
02:45:56,220 --> 02:45:57,840
I was like, where is it?

3612
02:45:58,040 --> 02:45:59,220
How do I get up there?

3613
02:46:00,720 --> 02:46:02,780
Oh no, I'm trying to figure out how to get up though.

3614
02:46:04,180 --> 02:46:05,440
Oh, not four minutes.

3615
02:46:06,580 --> 02:46:09,300
It's like up top, but like, how do I get up top?

3616
02:46:12,800 --> 02:46:15,180
Oh no, the magic from the...

3617
02:46:15,180 --> 02:46:16,620
God, stop being dumb!

3618
02:46:18,720 --> 02:46:20,140
These stupid ones!

3619
02:46:20,940 --> 02:46:22,240
How do I get up top?

3620
02:46:22,240 --> 02:46:22,600
Okay.

3621
02:46:23,320 --> 02:46:26,120
Oh no.

3622
02:46:26,420 --> 02:46:28,760
I'm trying to figure out how to get up top.

3623
02:46:29,900 --> 02:46:31,460
I'm so confused.

3624
02:46:34,500 --> 02:46:36,580
No, the horse can't jump!

3625
02:46:39,280 --> 02:46:40,700
Oh my God.

3626
02:46:40,860 --> 02:46:43,020
Where is the high ground?

3627
02:46:48,060 --> 02:46:49,460
I'm trying to figure out how.

3628
02:46:50,180 --> 02:46:51,180
Oh, he can?

3629
02:46:53,460 --> 02:46:54,420
How do I get up?

3630
02:46:55,760 --> 02:46:57,300
How do I jump up, guys?

3631
02:46:58,260 --> 02:46:58,680
Here?

3632
02:47:01,400 --> 02:47:02,420
No, I can't!

3633
02:47:02,460 --> 02:47:04,300
Oh, I can, I can, I can!

3634
02:47:04,560 --> 02:47:06,000
Okay, I figured it out.

3635
02:47:08,760 --> 02:47:09,900
No, no, no, no!

3636
02:47:11,840 --> 02:47:12,820
I'm heading over!

3637
02:47:12,840 --> 02:47:13,820
I'm heading over, Cao Cao!

3638
02:47:14,280 --> 02:47:15,840
I'm heading over, please!

3639
02:47:15,840 --> 02:47:17,520
I'm fucking...

3640
02:47:17,520 --> 02:47:18,460
I'm running over!

3641
02:47:20,720 --> 02:47:21,360
Please!

3642
02:47:22,120 --> 02:47:23,040
Cao Cao, please!

3643
02:47:24,620 --> 02:47:26,640
I figured out how to jump, Cao Cao!

3644
02:47:27,380 --> 02:47:27,660
Please!

3645
02:47:29,500 --> 02:47:31,400
I'm trying my best!

3646
02:47:35,540 --> 02:47:36,980
Okay, we did it.

3647
02:47:37,620 --> 02:47:39,760
That's right, I know magic too.

3648
02:47:40,720 --> 02:47:41,580
Burn it!

3649
02:47:42,420 --> 02:47:43,600
Oh, I do not have enough allies.

3650
02:47:43,600 --> 02:47:44,360
Whoops, sorry.

3651
02:47:46,560 --> 02:47:47,940
Okay, I need a fight.

3652
02:47:48,100 --> 02:47:49,440
Oh my god!

3653
02:47:49,860 --> 02:47:51,280
Guan Yun, are you okay?

3654
02:47:55,140 --> 02:47:56,700
Where are the leaders?

3655
02:47:59,400 --> 02:48:00,100
Where are they?

3656
02:48:00,240 --> 02:48:02,440
Your allies are preparing a grand tactic.

3657
02:48:03,020 --> 02:48:05,000
Preparations, when your allies are ready, approach them with a tactic.

3658
02:48:05,240 --> 02:48:06,120
They'll bring a heavy blow.

3659
02:48:06,240 --> 02:48:07,680
Oh my god, I'm ready.

3660
02:48:08,540 --> 02:48:09,540
I'm fucking...

3661
02:48:09,540 --> 02:48:11,200
No, Cao Cao!

3662
02:48:15,210 --> 02:48:16,190
Oh my god!

3663
02:48:16,710 --> 02:48:18,930
I just got here!

3664
02:48:19,430 --> 02:48:21,410
What do you mean?

3665
02:48:22,270 --> 02:48:24,690
Are you fucking kidding me?

3666
02:48:25,850 --> 02:48:26,350
I literally...

3667
02:48:26,950 --> 02:48:28,350
I just got here!

3668
02:48:28,830 --> 02:48:29,250
I...

3669
02:48:29,690 --> 02:48:32,290
I immediately failed.

3670
02:48:32,790 --> 02:48:33,850
I don't...

3671
02:48:33,850 --> 02:48:35,830
I don't understand!

3672
02:48:36,470 --> 02:48:38,010
Oh my god!

3673
02:48:38,170 --> 02:48:39,870
I don't understand!

3674
02:48:39,870 --> 02:48:43,090
I literally just got here!

3675
02:48:43,270 --> 02:48:45,790
How did you fucking die?

3676
02:48:46,870 --> 02:48:48,250
Oh my god!

3677
02:48:48,970 --> 02:48:50,270
Oh my god!

3678
02:48:51,050 --> 02:48:53,170
Why didn't you eat bread?

3679
02:48:57,510 --> 02:48:59,730
That's all you had to do!

3680
02:48:59,850 --> 02:49:01,110
You just had to eat bread!

3681
02:49:03,640 --> 02:49:08,530
I don't understand why they can't just eat bread.

3682
02:49:09,500 --> 02:49:10,670
Oh my god!

3683
02:49:12,210 --> 02:49:12,910
Please!

3684
02:49:13,590 --> 02:49:17,510
I am fighting my fucking heart out for all of you guys.

3685
02:49:17,950 --> 02:49:20,710
Like, I don't know what you want from me.

3686
02:49:20,730 --> 02:49:22,950
I'm literally fighting my...

3687
02:49:22,950 --> 02:49:28,910
I'm like your strongest character right now and I'm fucking trying my best.

3688
02:49:32,670 --> 02:49:35,830
Look, it's not... I'm just saying like...

3689
02:49:38,230 --> 02:49:38,870
Please!

3690
02:49:40,670 --> 02:49:41,310
Like...

3691
02:49:41,310 --> 02:49:45,430
I'm literally like doing my absolute best right now.

3692
02:49:45,590 --> 02:49:46,730
There we go.

3693
02:49:48,170 --> 02:49:49,210
There we go.

3694
02:49:49,310 --> 02:49:51,890
I went straight for the general at this point.

3695
02:49:58,310 --> 02:50:00,110
Oh my god!

3696
02:50:00,310 --> 02:50:02,690
How did only Cao Cao die?

3697
02:50:02,690 --> 02:50:03,490
How?

3698
02:50:04,470 --> 02:50:06,630
Don Juan lived longer than you!

3699
02:50:14,310 --> 02:50:17,470
I have to eat the bread.

3700
02:50:20,770 --> 02:50:22,970
Oh shit, not the reinforcements.

3701
02:50:26,250 --> 02:50:27,730
Oh my god.

3702
02:50:29,770 --> 02:50:30,970
Oh dang!

3703
02:50:31,110 --> 02:50:32,870
I survived Cao Cao.

3704
02:50:33,150 --> 02:50:33,790
Wait, what?

3705
02:50:36,530 --> 02:50:37,130
What?

3706
02:50:37,970 --> 02:50:38,850
Oh no.

3707
02:50:42,710 --> 02:50:43,310
What?

3708
02:50:45,290 --> 02:50:46,290
Oh shit.

3709
02:50:48,310 --> 02:50:50,570
Oh my god, this is gonna be a 1v1.

3710
02:50:53,630 --> 02:50:56,290
Oh my god, the voices, they're calling me.

3711
02:50:57,090 --> 02:50:58,410
They're calling me.

3712
02:50:58,570 --> 02:50:59,790
What do the voices say?

3713
02:51:00,710 --> 02:51:01,050
Hello?

3714
02:51:06,220 --> 02:51:07,740
I can't believe it.

3715
02:51:07,840 --> 02:51:09,980
I can't believe Cao Cao died.

3716
02:51:10,180 --> 02:51:17,380
I can't believe he just fucking... I just got there and it was like, he's dead.

3717
02:51:17,500 --> 02:51:19,160
I'm like, oh, okay.

3718
02:51:20,060 --> 02:51:20,700
Okay.

3719
02:51:23,060 --> 02:51:25,540
I didn't expect him to just die like that.

3720
02:51:25,620 --> 02:51:26,120
But okay.

3721
02:51:26,120 --> 02:51:27,240
Okay.

3722
02:51:30,470 --> 02:51:32,670
Alright, let's get the attack.

3723
02:51:36,270 --> 02:51:39,590
History changed so much for the short game.

3724
02:51:40,050 --> 02:51:42,470
Look, he's trying his best, okay?

3725
02:51:42,990 --> 02:51:45,670
He's trying so hard, okay?

3726
02:51:45,990 --> 02:51:48,690
It's not my fault that like...

3727
02:51:48,690 --> 02:51:50,950
that like, he tripped and fell.

3728
02:51:51,090 --> 02:51:51,930
Alright, guys?

3729
02:51:53,410 --> 02:51:54,390
What's this?

3730
02:51:54,450 --> 02:51:55,470
Is this gonna be a 1v1?

3731
02:51:56,470 --> 02:51:57,250
Hello?

3732
02:52:04,170 --> 02:52:06,350
He just hasn't got his mustache yet.

3733
02:52:25,470 --> 02:52:26,530
What the fuck?

3734
02:52:26,670 --> 02:52:27,870
Magic is real?

3735
02:52:31,590 --> 02:52:31,990
Wait.

3736
02:52:33,050 --> 02:52:35,370
Wait a minute.

3737
02:52:36,010 --> 02:52:37,710
I thought it was all tricks.

3738
02:52:37,850 --> 02:52:38,890
Oh shit, I'm sorry.

3739
02:52:38,990 --> 02:52:39,670
I got scared.

3740
02:52:39,890 --> 02:52:42,450
I was not expecting real magic.

3741
02:52:45,090 --> 02:52:46,230
I thought...

3742
02:52:46,230 --> 02:52:49,930
Oh my god, I didn't realize magic was real!

3743
02:52:53,130 --> 02:52:54,250
Holy shit!

3744
02:52:54,970 --> 02:52:57,790
It was real this entire time?!

3745
02:52:57,790 --> 02:52:59,490
He's a witch!

3746
02:53:00,010 --> 02:53:00,710
I killed him!

3747
02:53:03,230 --> 02:53:04,230
Oh my god.

3748
02:53:04,450 --> 02:53:05,790
He was actually a witch.

3749
02:53:06,530 --> 02:53:10,450
How do I fucking get rid of the rocks?

3750
02:53:10,730 --> 02:53:12,570
Do I just block it or evade it?

3751
02:53:14,510 --> 02:53:15,410
Oh shit.

3752
02:53:15,790 --> 02:53:16,390
Oh shit.

3753
02:53:16,930 --> 02:53:17,310
Guys, please.

3754
02:53:17,390 --> 02:53:21,490
I haven't learned how to... I haven't learned how to guard the rock yet.

3755
02:53:22,490 --> 02:53:24,950
I'm burning a witch right now.

3756
02:53:25,610 --> 02:53:27,090
He's actually a witch!

3757
02:53:28,210 --> 02:53:29,810
Do I just... Can I block it?

3758
02:53:30,130 --> 02:53:31,190
Oh, I can.

3759
02:53:31,410 --> 02:53:31,970
Look at that.

3760
02:53:32,890 --> 02:53:34,470
Oh my god, look at those poses though.

3761
02:53:38,050 --> 02:53:39,330
Okay, that...

3762
02:53:39,330 --> 02:53:40,630
The pose is funny.

3763
02:53:42,610 --> 02:53:44,270
Okay, I can actually block it.

3764
02:53:45,750 --> 02:53:46,770
Alright, watch.

3765
02:53:47,970 --> 02:53:50,690
Oh, that's slay, girl.

3766
02:53:52,950 --> 02:53:53,910
Oh shit!

3767
02:53:54,070 --> 02:53:54,630
That's not fair.

3768
02:53:55,070 --> 02:53:55,830
That's not fair.

3769
02:53:56,410 --> 02:53:57,390
I wasn't ready.

3770
02:54:00,390 --> 02:54:00,870
Come on.

3771
02:54:01,310 --> 02:54:02,150
Get out of here.

3772
02:54:03,750 --> 02:54:04,650
Oh shit!

3773
02:54:04,790 --> 02:54:05,090
No!

3774
02:54:05,930 --> 02:54:08,270
Are you fucking kidding me?!

3775
02:54:09,070 --> 02:54:10,730
Okay, I'm just gonna...

3776
02:54:10,730 --> 02:54:12,710
Well, let me just slay.

3777
02:54:12,710 --> 02:54:13,170
Slay.

3778
02:54:13,670 --> 02:54:14,110
Okay.

3779
02:54:17,190 --> 02:54:18,650
Slap that magic out of him.

3780
02:54:19,170 --> 02:54:19,890
That's fucking right.

3781
02:54:20,030 --> 02:54:21,110
How dare you use magic?

3782
02:54:22,710 --> 02:54:23,310
Alright, nice.

3783
02:54:25,230 --> 02:54:26,310
Jesus Christ.

3784
02:54:28,010 --> 02:54:29,730
Nice, I got it before he could use it.

3785
02:54:31,810 --> 02:54:32,610
Take this!

3786
02:54:35,230 --> 02:54:39,090
Jesus Christ, he's so fucking tanky!

3787
02:54:40,490 --> 02:54:41,570
He's actually...

3788
02:54:41,570 --> 02:54:42,810
I got it before him.

3789
02:54:43,550 --> 02:54:44,870
He's so tanky.

3790
02:54:45,010 --> 02:54:47,630
It's actually crazy how tanky he is.

3791
02:54:50,170 --> 02:54:50,870
Come on.

3792
02:54:51,190 --> 02:54:52,810
I got the Y.

3793
02:54:55,110 --> 02:54:56,790
I don't think I can win this.

3794
02:54:56,970 --> 02:54:57,570
I have...

3795
02:54:58,370 --> 02:54:58,950
What?

3796
02:54:59,270 --> 02:54:59,570
What?

3797
02:55:01,430 --> 02:55:03,630
Can I block this?

3798
02:55:04,850 --> 02:55:06,030
Oh, I can't!

3799
02:55:06,210 --> 02:55:08,090
I have to actually avoid it.

3800
02:55:10,410 --> 02:55:11,970
Oh, I'm a little worried.

3801
02:55:12,190 --> 02:55:13,830
I've only got to half HP.

3802
02:55:14,370 --> 02:55:16,270
I'm a little worried, guys.

3803
02:55:16,750 --> 02:55:17,270
I'm...

3804
02:55:17,270 --> 02:55:18,810
Oh, I'm a little worried.

3805
02:55:19,730 --> 02:55:21,750
I don't know if I can survive.

3806
02:55:25,530 --> 02:55:26,110
Alright.

3807
02:55:27,350 --> 02:55:28,610
Are you serious?

3808
02:55:29,150 --> 02:55:30,790
Guys, this is my last bud!

3809
02:55:32,910 --> 02:55:33,490
Okay.

3810
02:55:35,210 --> 02:55:35,790
Alright.

3811
02:55:38,090 --> 02:55:38,750
Nice.

3812
02:55:40,910 --> 02:55:41,670
Alright.

3813
02:55:42,430 --> 02:55:43,190
Okay.

3814
02:55:43,750 --> 02:55:46,090
I have one more button left, but...

3815
02:55:46,910 --> 02:55:47,250
Oh!

3816
02:55:48,190 --> 02:55:48,950
Oh!

3817
02:55:49,950 --> 02:55:51,730
Oh, there's too many rocks!

3818
02:55:52,130 --> 02:55:53,370
Oh, fuck!

3819
02:55:53,990 --> 02:55:55,610
I couldn't evade it, guys!

3820
02:55:55,910 --> 02:55:57,330
I got confused!

3821
02:56:01,590 --> 02:56:03,370
Oh my god!

3822
02:56:04,170 --> 02:56:06,610
Okay, this boss fight is difficult.

3823
02:56:07,310 --> 02:56:09,470
This boss fight is very scary.

3824
02:56:10,890 --> 02:56:13,450
I'm not doing as much damage as I would like.

3825
02:56:15,730 --> 02:56:16,350
Oh no!

3826
02:56:17,330 --> 02:56:17,810
Oh!

3827
02:56:19,210 --> 02:56:20,850
My heart is beating!

3828
02:56:21,710 --> 02:56:23,570
Guys, it ain't looking so good!

3829
02:56:23,690 --> 02:56:25,210
It ain't looking so good!

3830
02:56:26,210 --> 02:56:28,950
It's not looking so good, guys!

3831
02:56:31,070 --> 02:56:31,410
Okay.

3832
02:56:32,730 --> 02:56:33,570
Alright, nice.

3833
02:56:35,070 --> 02:56:36,170
Oh my god!

3834
02:56:36,310 --> 02:56:37,690
I'm getting a focus up!

3835
02:56:37,890 --> 02:56:38,310
Oh no!

3836
02:56:39,830 --> 02:56:41,110
Oh no!

3837
02:56:41,830 --> 02:56:42,250
Okay.

3838
02:56:43,430 --> 02:56:44,070
Dash!

3839
02:56:44,330 --> 02:56:44,610
Dash!

3840
02:56:44,870 --> 02:56:45,050
Dash!

3841
02:56:45,170 --> 02:56:45,430
No!

3842
02:56:47,690 --> 02:56:49,690
Oh my god!

3843
02:56:50,310 --> 02:56:52,030
I pressed R2!

3844
02:56:53,210 --> 02:56:54,390
Recreate battlefield?

3845
02:56:54,730 --> 02:56:55,730
Wait, what does that mean?

3846
02:56:57,830 --> 02:56:59,290
What does that mean?

3847
02:56:59,290 --> 02:56:59,330
What does that mean?

3848
02:57:04,180 --> 02:57:05,800
There's bread, but oh my god!

3849
02:57:05,860 --> 02:57:06,040
See?

3850
02:57:06,180 --> 02:57:07,860
There's 2, 4, 6, 8 bread!

3851
02:57:12,740 --> 02:57:14,340
Oh, it rewinds time?

3852
02:57:16,600 --> 02:57:21,240
After being defeated, this lets you take yet another look at how an event... Oh!

3853
02:57:23,220 --> 02:57:25,560
Oh, I know exactly what I did.

3854
02:57:25,660 --> 02:57:26,760
That was not good.

3855
02:57:26,880 --> 02:57:30,300
I know exactly where...

3856
02:57:31,120 --> 02:57:32,340
I ain't no pussy!

3857
02:57:34,620 --> 02:57:35,100
Wait.

3858
02:57:36,240 --> 02:57:37,580
Do I fight him here?

3859
02:57:38,780 --> 02:57:39,260
Or...

3860
02:57:39,900 --> 02:57:41,080
I ain't no pussy!

3861
02:57:42,880 --> 02:57:44,980
Oh, I can go back to before he died?

3862
02:57:45,300 --> 02:57:46,960
Oh wait, is this before he died?

3863
02:57:47,200 --> 02:57:48,060
Or like here?

3864
02:57:52,040 --> 02:57:54,760
Is this before he died or is this where I start the battle?

3865
02:57:54,960 --> 02:57:55,680
I don't remember.

3866
02:57:58,520 --> 02:58:00,560
Cause like, what's the difference between these two?

3867
02:58:06,260 --> 02:58:06,740
Oh!

3868
02:58:08,660 --> 02:58:09,140
Oh!

3869
02:58:09,600 --> 02:58:12,460
Okay, let's just restart from the beginning cause I want to keep my bread.

3870
02:58:13,540 --> 02:58:14,420
Can I bring my horse?

3871
02:58:14,720 --> 02:58:15,880
Wait, I can bring my horse.

3872
02:58:17,120 --> 02:58:20,200
A giant rock is fucking annoying.

3873
02:58:20,820 --> 02:58:22,660
My damage is way too low.

3874
02:58:30,010 --> 02:58:31,250
Yeah, I'm skipping this.

3875
02:58:31,850 --> 02:58:34,650
Jesus, guys, I'm a little worried about the Lu Bu fight now.

3876
02:58:34,950 --> 02:58:39,250
Guys, I don't know if I should pursue...

3877
02:58:43,510 --> 02:58:44,210
Guys...

3878
02:58:44,930 --> 02:58:47,550
Do I actually pursue Lu Bu?

3879
02:58:51,090 --> 02:58:52,550
Oh my god.

3880
02:58:52,910 --> 02:58:54,310
Wait a minute.

3881
02:58:55,230 --> 02:58:56,450
Wait a minute.

3882
02:58:57,310 --> 02:59:01,210
If Chang Qiao is like this difficult...

3883
02:59:01,210 --> 02:59:02,250
Oh my god.

3884
02:59:02,330 --> 02:59:04,310
Wait, how difficult is Lu Bu?

3885
02:59:05,450 --> 02:59:05,830
No.

3886
02:59:09,230 --> 02:59:10,970
Oh my god.

3887
02:59:10,990 --> 02:59:12,390
Do we pursue Lu Bu?

3888
02:59:16,920 --> 02:59:17,710
Okay, nice.

3889
02:59:18,730 --> 02:59:20,530
Don't worry, I got this.

3890
02:59:24,270 --> 02:59:27,200
Oh my god, they like actually Dark Souls this too.

3891
02:59:27,880 --> 02:59:28,460
Oh.

3892
02:59:29,620 --> 02:59:30,200
Okay.

3893
02:59:31,000 --> 02:59:31,580
Nice.

3894
02:59:33,820 --> 02:59:35,000
Alright, nice.

3895
02:59:36,560 --> 02:59:37,140
Okay.

3896
02:59:37,580 --> 02:59:41,400
I figured out the little rocks but the big rocks is where I'm a little scared though.

3897
02:59:43,060 --> 02:59:44,040
Alright, nice.

3898
02:59:46,960 --> 02:59:48,400
Okay, I got it.

3899
02:59:49,600 --> 02:59:50,600
Nice, I got the parry.

3900
02:59:52,540 --> 02:59:53,280
Come on.

3901
02:59:54,300 --> 02:59:55,740
Got the parry in though.

3902
02:59:59,020 --> 02:59:59,460
Nice.

3903
03:00:00,080 --> 03:00:00,980
Block, block, block.

3904
03:00:04,040 --> 03:00:05,640
Oh shit, I miscounted.

3905
03:00:06,020 --> 03:00:07,760
I actually miscounted that.

3906
03:00:08,100 --> 03:00:09,340
I didn't mean to do that.

3907
03:00:10,700 --> 03:00:12,580
I was like, that's right, I got you.

3908
03:00:13,860 --> 03:00:17,480
I was like, I didn't see the last rock at all.

3909
03:00:19,800 --> 03:00:20,640
No, nice.

3910
03:00:20,820 --> 03:00:22,100
No, I didn't get it?

3911
03:00:25,080 --> 03:00:25,680
What?!

3912
03:00:25,680 --> 03:00:29,220
Did she just say my apology after fucking me up?

3913
03:00:30,380 --> 03:00:31,540
I can't believe I didn't get that.

3914
03:00:31,740 --> 03:00:32,420
I'm so sad.

3915
03:00:33,460 --> 03:00:34,740
Oh my god.

3916
03:00:36,100 --> 03:00:38,520
Okay, I'm gonna eat the button real fast.

3917
03:00:39,040 --> 03:00:42,700
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no.

3918
03:00:45,040 --> 03:00:46,720
Oh, this is the halfway point.

3919
03:00:48,480 --> 03:00:49,920
Okay, that's fine.

3920
03:00:52,180 --> 03:00:53,140
Take this.

3921
03:00:54,320 --> 03:00:55,280
Attack, Taz.

3922
03:00:56,100 --> 03:00:57,280
That's fucking right.

3923
03:00:57,540 --> 03:00:59,060
That's right, I can block this.

3924
03:01:00,920 --> 03:01:02,520
No, no, no, no, no, no!

3925
03:01:04,740 --> 03:01:06,300
Oh my god.

3926
03:01:06,420 --> 03:01:08,100
Are you serious?!

3927
03:01:10,880 --> 03:01:13,560
Oh my god, I couldn't interrupt it in time.

3928
03:01:15,840 --> 03:01:17,260
I was gonna interrupt it.

3929
03:01:18,420 --> 03:01:19,620
Nice, okay, I got the interruption.

3930
03:01:19,620 --> 03:01:22,260
Come on, take it.

3931
03:01:23,980 --> 03:01:25,520
Oh, nice, parry.

3932
03:01:26,440 --> 03:01:27,160
Get parried.

3933
03:01:27,700 --> 03:01:29,960
Parried, you fucking wizard!

3934
03:01:31,700 --> 03:01:32,280
Oh!

3935
03:01:35,800 --> 03:01:36,560
Oh!

3936
03:01:38,360 --> 03:01:39,440
Haha, that's right.

3937
03:01:40,140 --> 03:01:41,360
I just run away.

3938
03:01:43,300 --> 03:01:45,660
Are you serious?!

3939
03:01:45,660 --> 03:01:47,080
Oh my god!

3940
03:01:47,080 --> 03:01:48,860
Oh, I hate that move, I hate that move.

3941
03:01:49,220 --> 03:01:53,120
I have to be, like, close to him to do it, so it's so frustrating.

3942
03:01:53,820 --> 03:01:54,380
Take this.

3943
03:01:54,620 --> 03:01:55,780
Because I'm not close enough.

3944
03:01:57,060 --> 03:01:58,920
I got it, I got it in time.

3945
03:01:59,420 --> 03:01:59,840
Is that it?

3946
03:02:02,120 --> 03:02:02,480
Nice.

3947
03:02:04,180 --> 03:02:04,860
Is that it?

3948
03:02:05,440 --> 03:02:05,800
What?

3949
03:02:06,680 --> 03:02:08,840
Oh my god, I didn't get my assault, there we go.

3950
03:02:11,440 --> 03:02:12,800
My arm is too short!

3951
03:02:12,800 --> 03:02:13,700
My arm is too short!

3952
03:02:19,980 --> 03:02:21,240
It's fucking right.

3953
03:02:22,540 --> 03:02:24,440
I know I can block that, it's not right!

3954
03:02:26,140 --> 03:02:26,480
What?

3955
03:02:26,640 --> 03:02:27,100
Nice, parry.

3956
03:02:28,440 --> 03:02:30,100
It's fucking right, got your shield.

3957
03:02:32,320 --> 03:02:33,340
It's not...

3958
03:02:33,340 --> 03:02:35,400
My hands might not do that much damage!

3959
03:02:35,800 --> 03:02:37,680
But that's okay, I'm right next to you!

3960
03:02:41,620 --> 03:02:42,200
What?

3961
03:02:42,200 --> 03:02:43,020
Okay, act like a party.

3962
03:02:45,160 --> 03:02:46,400
I love that.

3963
03:02:46,720 --> 03:02:51,560
All I can think about when I see him block, that's literally all I can think about.

3964
03:02:56,880 --> 03:02:58,540
Oh no, oh no.

3965
03:03:00,500 --> 03:03:00,660
What?

3966
03:03:02,200 --> 03:03:02,660
Yeah?

3967
03:03:12,540 --> 03:03:13,580
What?

3968
03:03:14,780 --> 03:03:15,380
Child?

3969
03:03:18,860 --> 03:03:20,100
God of War?

3970
03:03:21,460 --> 03:03:24,500
Oh my god, am I gonna go rage mode?

3971
03:03:26,020 --> 03:03:28,280
Oh my god!

3972
03:03:28,620 --> 03:03:29,860
It's time!

3973
03:03:30,580 --> 03:03:32,400
It's time, we're back!

3974
03:03:32,980 --> 03:03:35,700
We never left God of War!

3975
03:03:35,700 --> 03:03:38,360
It's fucking time!

3976
03:03:39,140 --> 03:03:41,080
You fucking...

3977
03:03:41,080 --> 03:03:42,200
Oh my god!

3978
03:03:43,640 --> 03:03:44,720
Oh my...

3979
03:03:44,720 --> 03:03:46,300
We never left!

3980
03:03:46,540 --> 03:03:48,480
I'm getting over!

3981
03:03:49,320 --> 03:03:51,500
I'm heading over!

3982
03:03:52,000 --> 03:03:54,100
It's rage art time!

3983
03:03:54,780 --> 03:03:57,380
That's right, we never left!

3984
03:04:01,560 --> 03:04:03,400
It's anger time!

3985
03:04:07,440 --> 03:04:08,360
Wait, that's it?

3986
03:04:15,040 --> 03:04:16,380
Wait, wait, that's not fair!

3987
03:04:27,560 --> 03:04:30,200
Wait, wait a minute!

3988
03:04:30,660 --> 03:04:31,920
Wait, there's one of me!

3989
03:04:33,880 --> 03:04:34,420
There's one of me!

3990
03:04:34,660 --> 03:04:37,240
Wait, that seems a little unbalanced now.

3991
03:04:39,440 --> 03:04:41,460
Wait a minute, where's my allies?

3992
03:04:42,160 --> 03:04:42,980
Wait a minute!

3993
03:04:45,060 --> 03:04:47,140
Wait, you get tornadoes too?

3994
03:04:47,760 --> 03:04:49,240
Oh my god!

3995
03:04:49,520 --> 03:04:50,860
Alright, if you're gonna...

3996
03:04:50,860 --> 03:04:52,660
Okay, let me get the buttons real quick.

3997
03:04:52,980 --> 03:04:53,700
Let me...

3998
03:04:53,700 --> 03:04:56,840
Let me grab these, then.

3999
03:04:56,860 --> 03:04:58,480
If we're gonna be doing this.

4000
03:04:58,480 --> 03:04:59,980
Alright, I don't know...

4001
03:04:59,980 --> 03:05:01,440
Oh, thank god, okay.

4002
03:05:02,740 --> 03:05:03,700
You are...

4003
03:05:03,700 --> 03:05:04,660
This looks...

4004
03:05:06,340 --> 03:05:08,060
Alright, guys.

4005
03:05:08,180 --> 03:05:09,340
It's Kingdom Hearts now.

4006
03:05:12,840 --> 03:05:14,820
We're gonna Kingdom Hearts this.

4007
03:05:18,940 --> 03:05:22,160
Oh my god, what kind of magic is he bringing forth now?

4008
03:05:24,460 --> 03:05:26,560
Okay, defeat 300 enemies.

4009
03:05:26,560 --> 03:05:27,060
Okay.

4010
03:05:28,620 --> 03:05:31,120
Alright, we got 59 right now.

4011
03:05:32,200 --> 03:05:33,680
Jesus Christ.

4012
03:05:34,960 --> 03:05:37,460
Okay, 100 and we got 100 already.

4013
03:05:38,500 --> 03:05:38,960
Alright.

4014
03:05:40,280 --> 03:05:41,120
It's time!

4015
03:05:43,060 --> 03:05:45,440
It's actually Kingdom Hearts time!

4016
03:05:45,540 --> 03:05:47,280
We gotta get rid of all the Heartless!

4017
03:05:49,600 --> 03:05:51,020
Jesus Christ.

4018
03:05:51,600 --> 03:05:52,100
200.

4019
03:05:52,320 --> 03:05:53,800
I'm so close to the next one.

4020
03:05:54,960 --> 03:05:55,560
Oh!

4021
03:05:55,560 --> 03:05:56,640
I don't care.

4022
03:05:56,820 --> 03:06:00,040
We're trying to get rid of the small... Holy fuck!

4023
03:06:00,120 --> 03:06:01,420
What the fuck out of my ear!

4024
03:06:01,800 --> 03:06:02,120
Help!

4025
03:06:02,960 --> 03:06:04,520
What the fuck!

4026
03:06:08,640 --> 03:06:11,240
I didn't travel all the way here!

4027
03:06:11,680 --> 03:06:13,940
I didn't...

4028
03:06:15,120 --> 03:06:17,760
Oh my god, let me grab more buttons.

4029
03:06:18,260 --> 03:06:20,300
The CC is insane.

4030
03:06:20,760 --> 03:06:21,680
I literally...

4031
03:06:21,680 --> 03:06:25,480
They like threw me into like a different dimension.

4032
03:06:26,340 --> 03:06:28,520
I was not ready for that.

4033
03:06:29,780 --> 03:06:31,580
I was like, where am I?

4034
03:06:35,160 --> 03:06:35,800
Alright.

4035
03:06:36,540 --> 03:06:39,980
We combo'd Yeah, he combo'd me so fucking hard.

4036
03:06:40,460 --> 03:06:42,560
I like traveled to a new area.

4037
03:06:44,440 --> 03:06:47,280
Okay, we gotta get rid of...

4038
03:06:47,280 --> 03:06:48,760
He's confused!

4039
03:06:48,920 --> 03:06:49,600
He stopped moving!

4040
03:06:50,540 --> 03:06:50,800
Okay.

4041
03:06:50,800 --> 03:06:53,640
Okay, we got...

4042
03:06:53,640 --> 03:06:54,100
Come on.

4043
03:06:55,220 --> 03:06:56,300
That's fucking right.

4044
03:06:56,540 --> 03:06:56,800
There we go.

4045
03:06:56,900 --> 03:06:57,540
I parried him.

4046
03:06:58,340 --> 03:07:00,620
I don't know there's too many people on my screen.

4047
03:07:02,040 --> 03:07:02,520
Like...

4048
03:07:03,040 --> 03:07:03,520
Okay.

4049
03:07:04,360 --> 03:07:04,840
Nice.

4050
03:07:06,100 --> 03:07:07,100
Oh my god!

4051
03:07:07,200 --> 03:07:07,800
Where am I?

4052
03:07:07,920 --> 03:07:08,640
Did I kill him?

4053
03:07:09,620 --> 03:07:11,240
Did I kill him?

4054
03:07:11,280 --> 03:07:12,140
I can't tell!

4055
03:07:12,480 --> 03:07:13,640
Where are the people?

4056
03:07:15,300 --> 03:07:16,680
Alright, I killed another boss.

4057
03:07:16,960 --> 03:07:17,800
I killed two bosses.

4058
03:07:18,040 --> 03:07:18,240
There we go.

4059
03:07:18,260 --> 03:07:19,800
Two bosses with the one hit.

4060
03:07:24,360 --> 03:07:24,980
Okay.

4061
03:07:27,740 --> 03:07:28,580
Alright, there we go.

4062
03:07:36,560 --> 03:07:37,940
Oh my god, please.

4063
03:07:38,660 --> 03:07:42,660
He's still fucking praying?!

4064
03:07:42,660 --> 03:07:44,040
Oh no.

4065
03:07:44,660 --> 03:07:45,560
Oh no!

4066
03:07:45,560 --> 03:07:48,040
That's not fair!

4067
03:07:50,600 --> 03:07:54,880
Who's letting him pray?!

4068
03:07:56,990 --> 03:07:57,470
Alright.

4069
03:07:58,950 --> 03:08:01,210
How is he still allowed to pray?!

4070
03:08:05,890 --> 03:08:07,290
Oh my god.

4071
03:08:08,130 --> 03:08:09,450
Somebody stop him!

4072
03:08:11,950 --> 03:08:14,310
Somebody stop him from praying!

4073
03:08:15,630 --> 03:08:16,910
That's illegal!

4074
03:08:17,970 --> 03:08:20,330
Not the boss in prayers.

4075
03:08:20,710 --> 03:08:21,170
Bro!

4076
03:08:21,510 --> 03:08:24,310
What am I supposed to do?!

4077
03:08:27,870 --> 03:08:30,050
Like, this isn't fair!

4078
03:08:32,910 --> 03:08:35,130
I'm trying my best here.

4079
03:08:35,850 --> 03:08:37,190
He's praying.

4080
03:08:37,370 --> 03:08:38,810
What do you want me to do?

4081
03:08:42,010 --> 03:08:42,690
Oh no.

4082
03:08:42,690 --> 03:08:43,690
There's like, twisters!

4083
03:08:44,270 --> 03:08:45,970
And like, fucking lightning!

4084
03:08:46,650 --> 03:08:48,830
I'm punching everybody right now!

4085
03:08:51,110 --> 03:08:52,110
Oh no.

4086
03:08:55,630 --> 03:08:56,610
Oh no.

4087
03:08:58,450 --> 03:09:00,030
Oh, thank god we got 300.

4088
03:09:01,270 --> 03:09:02,350
Oh my god.

4089
03:09:04,310 --> 03:09:05,570
Oh, thank god.

4090
03:09:06,830 --> 03:09:08,650
Oh my god.

4091
03:09:08,750 --> 03:09:09,450
Thank god.

4092
03:09:14,550 --> 03:09:15,390
Okay.

4093
03:09:15,690 --> 03:09:17,870
There we go.

4094
03:09:20,790 --> 03:09:21,930
Oh, thank god.

4095
03:09:24,070 --> 03:09:25,710
It's just Zhang Jiao now.

4096
03:09:29,970 --> 03:09:32,390
I killed all his fucking allies!

4097
03:09:32,390 --> 03:09:34,730
It's you and I now!

4098
03:09:36,190 --> 03:09:37,110
Oh, fuck, okay.

4099
03:09:38,310 --> 03:09:39,390
That's right!

4100
03:09:41,010 --> 03:09:42,110
That's right!

4101
03:09:42,610 --> 03:09:44,130
No more praying for you!

4102
03:09:46,830 --> 03:09:47,510
Please.

4103
03:09:48,550 --> 03:09:51,810
I am killing a fucking god right now.

4104
03:09:52,650 --> 03:09:53,730
Just chill.

4105
03:09:54,010 --> 03:09:55,310
You're literally fighting minions.

4106
03:09:55,590 --> 03:09:57,310
You're just fighting the little guys now.

4107
03:10:05,830 --> 03:10:06,310
Fine.

4108
03:10:07,890 --> 03:10:09,790
I'm doing like 15 damage.

4109
03:10:10,870 --> 03:10:12,230
Wow, everybody else.

4110
03:10:12,350 --> 03:10:13,490
Well, he's doing like 100.

4111
03:10:14,190 --> 03:10:15,390
Oh, he's so low.

4112
03:10:15,450 --> 03:10:16,110
He's so low.

4113
03:10:16,370 --> 03:10:17,550
Are you serious?

4114
03:10:18,390 --> 03:10:20,390
Are you- AHHHHH!

4115
03:10:21,590 --> 03:10:21,930
Okay.

4116
03:10:22,630 --> 03:10:23,110
Nice!

4117
03:10:24,910 --> 03:10:25,930
Oh, he's so low.

4118
03:10:25,970 --> 03:10:26,330
Come on, come on!

4119
03:10:28,250 --> 03:10:28,970
Come on!

4120
03:10:30,410 --> 03:10:32,110
Oh, I did not mean to get on a horse.

4121
03:10:35,310 --> 03:10:35,790
Sorry.

4122
03:10:36,150 --> 03:10:40,130
I accidentally got on a horse, but like, that's not what I wanted to do.

4123
03:10:42,130 --> 03:10:43,950
It looked cool though, didn't it?

4124
03:10:44,730 --> 03:10:45,690
Oh, fuck.

4125
03:10:45,910 --> 03:10:46,870
Oh, fuck.

4126
03:10:47,170 --> 03:10:48,090
Oh, fuck.

4127
03:10:48,210 --> 03:10:48,850
Oh, fuck.

4128
03:10:48,930 --> 03:10:49,710
Oh, fuck.

4129
03:10:49,790 --> 03:10:50,090
Okay.

4130
03:10:51,970 --> 03:10:52,250
No!

4131
03:10:54,290 --> 03:10:55,870
He got rocked!

4132
03:10:56,570 --> 03:10:59,930
He got- He got rocked!

4133
03:11:01,030 --> 03:11:03,450
No, that's supposed to be Sun Jian!

4134
03:11:03,810 --> 03:11:04,110
Wait!

4135
03:11:07,790 --> 03:11:08,450
No!

4136
03:11:10,530 --> 03:11:12,430
History has been rewritten!

4137
03:11:15,790 --> 03:11:17,490
I can't believe it.

4138
03:11:19,990 --> 03:11:20,930
Oh, thank god.

4139
03:11:21,190 --> 03:11:22,710
That was so hard.

4140
03:11:22,910 --> 03:11:25,390
That was actually a really difficult fight.

4141
03:11:35,330 --> 03:11:36,650
Wait, what?

4142
03:11:39,390 --> 03:11:42,990
He just got Thanos-stabbed?

4143
03:11:43,910 --> 03:11:45,930
Wait, what do you mean he disappeared in thin air?

4144
03:11:47,810 --> 03:11:49,430
What do you mean?

4145
03:11:51,670 --> 03:11:56,150
Concentrate my bravery to launch a shockwave.

4146
03:11:56,990 --> 03:11:57,790
Oh, shit.

4147
03:11:58,050 --> 03:11:58,670
Wait, that's cool.

4148
03:12:00,570 --> 03:12:02,050
I'm gonna boost my bravery then.

4149
03:12:02,950 --> 03:12:03,850
Let's go, Walnut!

4150
03:12:04,130 --> 03:12:05,190
Let's fucking go!

4151
03:12:08,650 --> 03:12:09,630
Okay, nice.

4152
03:12:10,070 --> 03:12:10,950
What did I do?

4153
03:12:12,410 --> 03:12:12,930
Uh...

4154
03:12:13,530 --> 03:12:16,010
Okay, yeah, I won't be able to encourage my horse.

4155
03:12:18,470 --> 03:12:21,390
I thought it was- I thought it was trickery.

4156
03:12:21,490 --> 03:12:23,010
You mean magic is real?

4157
03:12:26,810 --> 03:12:28,030
It's alright.

4158
03:12:28,450 --> 03:12:30,430
Lu Bei took Sun Jian's rock.

4159
03:12:53,310 --> 03:12:55,830
We'll only exhaust our troops.

4160
03:12:57,190 --> 03:12:57,750
Oh.

4161
03:12:58,730 --> 03:13:01,410
He will die soon, even if we leave him be.

4162
03:13:02,110 --> 03:13:05,910
Not even a doctor of surpassing skill would be able to save him.

4163
03:13:06,030 --> 03:13:07,690
Can we just, like, magic his wounds?

4164
03:13:07,990 --> 03:13:09,890
But his death must be one of humiliation.

4165
03:13:10,090 --> 03:13:10,470
Damn.

4166
03:13:11,850 --> 03:13:12,950
You want to?

4167
03:13:14,430 --> 03:13:18,810
A hero who died bravely, fighting to the bitter end.

4168
03:13:19,850 --> 03:13:23,730
Such a death could very well become the symbol for another uprising.

4169
03:13:23,770 --> 03:13:24,370
That's true.

4170
03:13:24,830 --> 03:13:29,570
Unless we cut off his head and display it, the Yellow Turbans will rise again.

4171
03:13:30,070 --> 03:13:31,670
They just made him a mayor.

4172
03:13:32,050 --> 03:13:32,850
Or a matra?

4173
03:13:33,150 --> 03:13:33,930
Is that how it's called?

4174
03:13:34,570 --> 03:13:35,670
He's not wrong.

4175
03:13:36,450 --> 03:13:38,330
Split up and search for Zhang Chao.

4176
03:13:38,710 --> 03:13:39,030
Understood?

4177
03:13:42,170 --> 03:13:42,730
A martyr?

4178
03:13:42,850 --> 03:13:44,370
I don't know how to pronounce a martyr, yeah?

4179
03:13:52,000 --> 03:13:53,380
Congratulations, Ziluan.

4180
03:13:53,960 --> 03:13:54,760
What does that mean?

4181
03:13:55,920 --> 03:13:56,720
I did?

4182
03:13:57,260 --> 03:13:58,040
What did I get?

4183
03:14:08,720 --> 03:14:09,880
Do you know something?

4184
03:14:10,200 --> 03:14:11,000
Yeah, what do you know?

4185
03:14:26,660 --> 03:14:28,680
Who is he?

4186
03:14:29,600 --> 03:14:30,500
Zhang Chao?

4187
03:14:40,160 --> 03:14:41,920
The fuck?

4188
03:14:42,840 --> 03:14:43,860
Who is he?

4189
03:14:49,470 --> 03:14:50,990
Who the fuck is he?

4190
03:14:51,990 --> 03:14:54,710
Can she not be more specific for me?

4191
03:14:55,250 --> 03:14:57,250
Have I been here though?

4192
03:14:59,730 --> 03:15:00,810
Yeah, I have.

4193
03:15:00,910 --> 03:15:02,450
Oh, this is where I started.

4194
03:15:03,290 --> 03:15:04,430
I remember now.

4195
03:15:06,370 --> 03:15:07,050
Freedom!

4196
03:15:08,350 --> 03:15:08,910
Freedom!

4197
03:15:09,950 --> 03:15:11,470
Sorry, I'm like obsessed with this.

4198
03:15:14,870 --> 03:15:15,550
Alright.

4199
03:15:31,560 --> 03:15:32,240
Hello?

4200
03:15:33,660 --> 03:15:36,580
I'm told that somebody's waiting for me here.

4201
03:15:39,320 --> 03:15:41,080
Oh my god, Zhang Chao!

4202
03:15:41,120 --> 03:15:41,780
Is that you?

4203
03:15:45,830 --> 03:15:47,530
You look so healthy.

4204
03:15:56,270 --> 03:15:58,710
Sakura Blossom means love.

4205
03:15:59,390 --> 03:16:01,410
Don't say that.

4206
03:16:10,600 --> 03:16:12,700
To help those in need.

4207
03:16:14,540 --> 03:16:25,000
But lose your way and you shall be punished by a guardian of peace.

4208
03:16:34,600 --> 03:16:37,400
And now...

4209
03:16:37,400 --> 03:16:42,760
Tell me.

4210
03:16:44,840 --> 03:16:46,040
Where did

4211
03:16:50,480 --> 03:16:51,180
I...

4212
03:16:51,180 --> 03:16:52,380
I can't fix you.

4213
03:16:52,580 --> 03:16:54,540
Woah, woah, woah!

4214
03:16:54,740 --> 03:16:55,580
Personal space!

4215
03:16:57,900 --> 03:17:00,880
Why wasn't I able to prevent that?

4216
03:17:02,840 --> 03:17:12,080
If this is just human nature then there is no way to save this world.

4217
03:17:20,600 --> 03:17:22,080
A question.

4218
03:17:22,080 --> 03:17:25,740
We humans are not ready to have answered.

4219
03:17:30,100 --> 03:17:32,960
I'm sorry, I couldn't fix you.

4220
03:17:33,740 --> 03:17:36,240
The great sage Zhang Chao.

4221
03:17:40,880 --> 03:17:44,720
The people to dream of peace.

4222
03:17:44,840 --> 03:17:46,840
Bro, thousands of people died!

4223
03:17:47,620 --> 03:17:49,280
That is not peace.

4224
03:17:49,640 --> 03:17:51,000
Dreams can move people.

4225
03:17:52,920 --> 03:17:55,680
People can change the world.

4226
03:17:55,680 --> 03:17:57,260
There

4227
03:18:16,780 --> 03:18:19,080
must be...

4228
03:18:19,080 --> 03:18:20,420
Must be what?

4229
03:18:21,980 --> 03:18:24,240
Must be one Zhang Chao!

4230
03:18:24,920 --> 03:18:25,380
No!

4231
03:18:28,960 --> 03:18:30,980
We'll never know!

4232
03:18:38,900 --> 03:18:39,820
No!

4233
03:18:40,160 --> 03:18:43,280
I'm gonna fucking sleep at night thinking about it!

4234
03:18:50,140 --> 03:18:53,120
The eternal cliffhanger.

4235
03:19:05,040 --> 03:19:06,120
A what?

4236
03:19:25,780 --> 03:19:28,060
That makes me sick to my stomach.

4237
03:19:30,860 --> 03:19:34,300
We must learn from Zhang Chao.

4238
03:19:37,040 --> 03:19:38,000
Learn what?

4239
03:19:38,220 --> 03:19:39,320
What do you mean by that?

4240
03:19:39,820 --> 03:19:44,560
Ever since we first fought against the Yellow Turbans I have been thinking.

4241
03:19:45,560 --> 03:19:52,700
I believe Zhang Chao was a man of dignity who stood up to help those in suffering.

4242
03:19:52,700 --> 03:19:56,460
What a fucking rewrite of like his entire identity.

4243
03:20:09,820 --> 03:20:12,680
Carrying a peace kill count of a few thousand.

4244
03:20:13,940 --> 03:20:15,440
MrBrokenBot, thank you for the superchat.

4245
03:20:15,600 --> 03:20:16,360
Thank you, thank you.

4246
03:20:22,700 --> 03:20:24,540
We have plenty of time now that the battle is over.

4247
03:20:25,700 --> 03:20:29,180
And apparently, there is an official post we'll be needed for here in G.

4248
03:20:29,900 --> 03:20:32,380
Oh shit, what a fucking snake, Lu Bei!

4249
03:20:34,940 --> 03:20:36,740
Already sneaking up to get promoted.

4250
03:20:49,400 --> 03:20:51,980
And me too, the fourth swan brother.

4251
03:21:01,340 --> 03:21:02,980
Wait, but what would I do?

4252
03:21:11,980 --> 03:21:13,460
Wait, wait a minute.

4253
03:21:14,180 --> 03:21:15,220
What about me?

4254
03:21:15,220 --> 03:21:16,060
What about me?

4255
03:21:18,040 --> 03:21:20,580
Can't you just disbanded like that?

4256
03:21:22,480 --> 03:21:24,000
You were my employer.

4257
03:21:25,720 --> 03:21:27,580
Wait, what about me, Lu Bei?

4258
03:21:46,060 --> 03:21:47,160
Impatient as ever.

4259
03:21:48,080 --> 03:21:51,160
And where is it you intend to go in such a hurry?

4260
03:21:54,480 --> 03:21:55,040
Luoyang.

4261
03:21:56,440 --> 03:21:57,260
Cao Cao.

4262
03:21:58,240 --> 03:21:59,080
You can't be.

4263
03:21:59,820 --> 03:22:02,660
Justice has been dealt to Zhang Jiao, the renegade.

4264
03:22:02,920 --> 03:22:03,840
It's time to fight.

4265
03:22:04,520 --> 03:22:06,420
It's time to pursue Lu Bu, guys.

4266
03:22:07,100 --> 03:22:08,500
That is not righteous.

4267
03:22:09,840 --> 03:22:10,780
No eyepatch?

4268
03:22:10,820 --> 03:22:12,240
He hasn't been shot in the eye yet.

4269
03:22:12,240 --> 03:22:13,800
Very soon.

4270
03:22:13,880 --> 03:22:15,580
Very, very soon.

4271
03:22:17,960 --> 03:22:20,140
I shall pursue him!

4272
03:22:20,220 --> 03:22:21,820
No one can stop me!

4273
03:22:23,440 --> 03:22:28,180
I'm a little worried though, because that Zhang Jiao fight was a little worrisome.

4274
03:22:29,340 --> 03:22:32,740
He's never been that difficult to kill until now.

4275
03:22:33,200 --> 03:22:36,860
I'm a little worried that this fucking wizard actually knew magic.

4276
03:22:42,440 --> 03:22:43,660
What's wrong, my lord?

4277
03:22:44,060 --> 03:22:48,600
I feel like Lu Bu's just gonna press one button and I'm just gonna be dead.

4278
03:22:50,720 --> 03:22:54,380
Oh no, he's just gonna bring out his own fucking magic at this point.

4279
03:22:55,620 --> 03:23:01,440
But with them gone, where will people's rage and discontent be aimed at now?

4280
03:23:01,440 --> 03:23:03,920
He's just gonna look at me and I'm just gonna get a heart attack.

4281
03:23:04,960 --> 03:23:07,300
And I'm gonna be like oh my god, what?

4282
03:23:08,820 --> 03:23:11,600
Another storm will be brewing soon.

4283
03:23:12,660 --> 03:23:14,140
We are the Sun.

4284
03:23:14,480 --> 03:23:16,460
The proud blades of the Han.

4285
03:23:17,160 --> 03:23:21,240
Whatever the circumstances, we must fulfill our duty as warriors.

4286
03:23:32,670 --> 03:23:36,190
Honestly, his horse is gonna touch me and I'm gonna fucking die too.

4287
03:23:38,110 --> 03:23:41,730
His horse is just gonna trample me to death before I get to him.

4288
03:23:49,030 --> 03:23:51,790
Only that I am a guardian.

4289
03:24:07,610 --> 03:24:13,850
I can read the winds?

4290
03:24:14,870 --> 03:24:16,670
How fucking...

4291
03:24:16,670 --> 03:24:18,950
How fucked up is this instance?

4292
03:24:29,150 --> 03:24:31,470
That's some strong ass instance.

4293
03:24:54,470 --> 03:24:55,110
...

4294
03:24:59,270 --> 03:25:00,670
And how did I...

4295
03:25:02,230 --> 03:25:03,650
Yeah, am I the last one?

4296
03:25:04,750 --> 03:25:05,890
Me and her?

4297
03:25:09,610 --> 03:25:11,870
I will end the bloodline with me.

4298
03:25:17,750 --> 03:25:18,230
...

4299
03:25:22,830 --> 03:25:24,330
Wait, I'm not him?

4300
03:25:33,670 --> 03:25:37,970
Wait, I'm not the main... You can't just tell me that right now I'm not the main...

4301
03:25:37,970 --> 03:25:40,410
I'm not the main... A true... Okay.

4302
03:25:40,650 --> 03:25:41,090
A true hero.

4303
03:25:41,150 --> 03:25:42,290
I'm not the main character.

4304
03:25:42,530 --> 03:25:44,950
I am not the main character?!

4305
03:25:46,670 --> 03:25:49,590
I need to find Zhaoyun, guys.

4306
03:25:51,350 --> 03:25:55,090
Koei has managed to squeeze Zhaoyun in here.

4307
03:25:55,370 --> 03:25:57,850
I gotta find Zhaoyun.

4308
03:26:03,230 --> 03:26:06,670
They're like, you thought you were the main character?

4309
03:26:07,010 --> 03:26:09,290
It's time for you to find Zhaoyun.

4310
03:26:30,110 --> 03:26:30,770
Hello?

4311
03:26:35,250 --> 03:26:36,570
Oh my god, is she hot?

4312
03:26:38,790 --> 03:26:39,550
How hot?

4313
03:26:44,490 --> 03:26:45,690
Oh, it's like a memory.

4314
03:26:50,050 --> 03:26:51,430
I thought it was a different girl.

4315
03:27:05,440 --> 03:27:05,720
What's wrong?

4316
03:27:10,050 --> 03:27:11,870
Can't believe I'm not the main...

4317
03:27:11,870 --> 03:27:15,450
I swear to god, if they try to make me find Zhaoyun, I swear... That is so...

4318
03:27:15,450 --> 03:27:16,870
I feel like I'm sitting in a chair.

4319
03:27:21,450 --> 03:27:25,290
After all that, it's always Zhaoyun.

4320
03:27:25,510 --> 03:27:28,570
After all that, it's always him.

4321
03:27:29,050 --> 03:27:30,690
It's always him!

4322
03:27:37,680 --> 03:27:38,660
Yes, please.

4323
03:27:44,820 --> 03:27:46,700
I'm never the main character.

4324
03:28:06,900 --> 03:28:09,980
That's basically the Flurry Kingdoms era.

4325
03:28:16,440 --> 03:28:17,520
Chapter 2.

4326
03:28:18,500 --> 03:28:20,120
Dong Zhuo's treachery in the capital.

4327
03:28:21,680 --> 03:28:24,900
The lords answered Cao Cao's call and assembled.

4328
03:28:29,970 --> 03:28:32,350
We have a time skip before the next...

4329
03:28:32,350 --> 03:28:35,290
the famous Do Not Pursue Lu Bu.

4330
03:28:42,460 --> 03:28:46,020
That's okay, you're our favorite NPC cast.

4331
03:28:46,320 --> 03:28:47,400
Thank you, Lucifer cast.

4332
03:28:47,400 --> 03:28:48,040
Thank you, thank you.

4333
03:28:50,680 --> 03:28:53,560
The world is becoming a dangerous place.

4334
03:28:55,260 --> 03:28:58,540
Professional soldiers have been kept busy, to say the least.

4335
03:28:59,300 --> 03:29:00,960
We appreciate your service.

4336
03:29:02,220 --> 03:29:03,860
Ah, I almost forgot.

4337
03:29:04,620 --> 03:29:06,120
I came to bring you your letters.

4338
03:29:06,880 --> 03:29:10,000
Who knows, maybe some wealthy lords... Oh my god, my super chat!

4339
03:29:10,800 --> 03:29:13,780
Well, if you have anything to ask me, now's a good time to do it.

4340
03:29:17,380 --> 03:29:18,320
Letters for me?

4341
03:29:18,320 --> 03:29:20,540
Yes, a few arrived while you were away.

4342
03:29:21,280 --> 03:29:24,060
Oh my god, I have a backlog of super chats, guys.

4343
03:29:24,160 --> 03:29:24,980
Just like real life.

4344
03:29:29,400 --> 03:29:30,280
Alright, uh...

4345
03:29:30,280 --> 03:29:31,100
Where are the good jobs?

4346
03:29:31,880 --> 03:29:36,060
The volunteer army has disbanded, so now you need a new source of income.

4347
03:29:36,580 --> 03:29:37,060
Is that right?

4348
03:29:39,080 --> 03:29:40,340
Well, let's see.

4349
03:29:41,040 --> 03:29:42,960
The lords of the land are always recruiting.

4350
03:29:43,020 --> 03:29:45,320
That's true, they're always hiring mercenaries and stuff.

4351
03:29:45,500 --> 03:29:46,200
Here's a letter.

4352
03:29:46,200 --> 03:29:47,520
Darkblade, thank you for the super chat!

4353
03:29:47,640 --> 03:29:47,820
Thank you!

4354
03:29:51,940 --> 03:29:52,500
Alright.

4355
03:29:55,540 --> 03:29:57,440
I don't have anything else to ask.

4356
03:29:58,900 --> 03:29:59,520
Alright, guys.

4357
03:29:59,820 --> 03:30:01,420
It's time to do super chat reading.

4358
03:30:02,860 --> 03:30:06,260
I read my letters from ye olde ancient China times.

4359
03:30:10,450 --> 03:30:11,870
Alright, how many?

4360
03:30:12,050 --> 03:30:13,530
Only two?!

4361
03:30:14,630 --> 03:30:16,630
After everything I did.

4362
03:30:16,630 --> 03:30:19,550
And one of them is just from Lupe.

4363
03:30:21,070 --> 03:30:21,910
Not Doki.

4364
03:30:22,270 --> 03:30:24,810
Yellow Turban Soldier, thank you for the super chat!

4365
03:30:24,910 --> 03:30:25,990
Thank you, thank you!

4366
03:30:26,190 --> 03:30:32,790
I do not know if you remember me, but I was a child who tried to steal to take care of my ill father and was almost cut down by an official.

4367
03:30:33,270 --> 03:30:37,290
That child is now a member of the Yellow Turbans, fighting to change the world.

4368
03:30:37,650 --> 03:30:40,470
Now the time has come for me to face you alongside Chang'e.

4369
03:30:40,670 --> 03:30:44,570
To be completely truthful, I've already seen you in battle many times.

4370
03:30:44,570 --> 03:30:49,330
The warrior with the piercing gaze threatening my comrades, but I wasn't scared.

4371
03:30:49,590 --> 03:30:51,530
After all, you're my hero.

4372
03:30:51,850 --> 03:30:57,750
I don't think you'll recognize me when we next meet, so I want to tell you how thankful I am while I can.

4373
03:30:58,190 --> 03:31:02,550
It's because of you that I was able to live my own convictions, and I have no regret.

4374
03:31:02,830 --> 03:31:04,410
I think I killed this Dragoon.

4375
03:31:05,710 --> 03:31:06,910
I'm pretty sure.

4376
03:31:07,730 --> 03:31:09,670
I'm pretty...

4377
03:31:09,670 --> 03:31:13,450
He was one of the 300 soldiers I killed during that fight.

4378
03:31:14,350 --> 03:31:16,070
He's probably dead.

4379
03:31:16,470 --> 03:31:17,510
He probably is.

4380
03:31:18,410 --> 03:31:20,770
Okay, Lu Bei, how have you been faring?

4381
03:31:20,990 --> 03:31:21,950
I'm busy as always.

4382
03:31:22,490 --> 03:31:24,970
My days are largely spent rushing from place to place.

4383
03:31:25,370 --> 03:31:27,870
I'm here in Yu Province now, and thoughts of you...

4384
03:31:27,870 --> 03:31:28,350
Whoa!

4385
03:31:31,070 --> 03:31:32,570
Whoa, Lu Bei.

4386
03:31:32,690 --> 03:31:35,970
I'm gonna use the bathroom after I got steamy, Lu Bei.

4387
03:31:36,690 --> 03:31:37,210
Whoa!

4388
03:31:37,470 --> 03:31:38,590
Alright, I'll be right back.

4389
03:31:38,630 --> 03:31:39,550
I need to use the bathroom.

4390
03:33:18,280 --> 03:33:19,000
Back.

4391
03:33:20,340 --> 03:33:22,340
While I'm not certain what prompted these thoughts...

4392
03:33:23,980 --> 03:33:27,200
While I am not certain what prompted...

4393
03:33:27,200 --> 03:33:28,340
Who wrote this?

4394
03:33:29,280 --> 03:33:31,220
Okay, they know what they're doing.

4395
03:33:31,660 --> 03:33:41,060
While I am not certain what prompted these thoughts, I am certain that Guan Yin and Zhang Fei miss you just as much as I do.

4396
03:33:41,300 --> 03:33:44,040
Our world is a dangerous place.

4397
03:33:44,640 --> 03:33:47,340
What should we ever be...

4398
03:33:51,490 --> 03:33:57,220
What should we ever be fortunate enough to meet again?

4399
03:33:57,620 --> 03:34:01,680
We must make it another time to remember.

4400
03:34:02,800 --> 03:34:06,320
What do you throw?

4401
03:34:06,820 --> 03:34:09,300
I can't even read this seriously.

4402
03:34:09,560 --> 03:34:10,240
I can't.

4403
03:34:10,440 --> 03:34:12,420
Oh my god.

4404
03:34:12,900 --> 03:34:14,260
Oh my...

4405
03:34:14,260 --> 03:34:15,940
Oh my god.

4406
03:34:16,740 --> 03:34:18,580
No homo though.

4407
03:34:18,820 --> 03:34:20,120
No homo.

4408
03:34:21,980 --> 03:34:23,180
This is...

4409
03:34:23,180 --> 03:34:26,840
Bro, what kind of letter am I fucking...

4410
03:34:26,840 --> 03:34:32,860
I don't know.

4411
03:34:33,240 --> 03:34:35,600
What kind of letter am I reading?

4412
03:34:36,220 --> 03:34:37,420
Literally all...

4413
03:34:37,420 --> 03:34:40,740
Oh my god.

4414
03:34:41,740 --> 03:34:43,060
Oh my god.

4415
03:34:43,880 --> 03:34:45,320
Oh my god.

4416
03:34:45,320 --> 03:34:45,620
I can't.

4417
03:34:46,180 --> 03:34:48,180
I don't...

4418
03:34:49,640 --> 03:34:52,600
They knew what they were doing.

4419
03:34:52,880 --> 03:34:54,380
Oh my god.

4420
03:34:55,800 --> 03:34:58,640
They knew exactly what they were doing.

4421
03:34:58,960 --> 03:35:06,000
He's playing Dynasty Warriors Origin on stream while playing the nasty Warriors in your head.

4422
03:35:06,440 --> 03:35:09,000
Thank you for superchatting.

4423
03:35:09,420 --> 03:35:11,780
Just really good roommates.

4424
03:35:13,540 --> 03:35:15,140
Many thank you for the superchat.

4425
03:35:15,240 --> 03:35:15,520
Thank you.

4426
03:35:15,540 --> 03:35:16,160
Thank you.

4427
03:35:16,200 --> 03:35:17,380
This isn't a letter.

4428
03:35:17,980 --> 03:35:19,580
This is a booty call.

4429
03:35:19,700 --> 03:35:21,140
Thank you for the superchat.

4430
03:35:21,300 --> 03:35:21,780
Thank you.

4431
03:35:22,880 --> 03:35:23,980
Oh my...

4432
03:35:23,980 --> 03:35:25,900
Oh my god.

4433
03:35:26,140 --> 03:35:26,600
Wow.

4434
03:35:29,460 --> 03:35:30,180
Wow.

4435
03:35:32,100 --> 03:35:33,680
Holy shit.

4436
03:35:34,700 --> 03:35:35,420
Wow.

4437
03:35:36,620 --> 03:35:37,340
Wow.

4438
03:35:37,620 --> 03:35:37,980
Okay.

4439
03:35:37,980 --> 03:35:40,380
Oh my god.

4440
03:35:40,420 --> 03:35:41,880
I was not...

4441
03:35:41,880 --> 03:35:43,220
Oh my god.

4442
03:35:43,260 --> 03:35:45,180
He's fucking wild.

4443
03:35:49,700 --> 03:35:51,840
Oh my god.

4444
03:35:51,940 --> 03:35:53,360
He's so wild.

4445
03:35:56,180 --> 03:35:57,440
Oh my god.

4446
03:35:57,540 --> 03:35:58,240
I'm not...

4447
03:35:58,240 --> 03:36:00,420
I'm not okay right now.

4448
03:36:00,560 --> 03:36:03,320
That was actually a wild thing I read today.

4449
03:36:11,550 --> 03:36:12,070
Alright.

4450
03:36:13,770 --> 03:36:18,590
In both history and the novel, the three sworn brothers all slept in the same bed at times.

4451
03:36:18,690 --> 03:36:19,690
I'm just saying.

4452
03:36:20,110 --> 03:36:22,290
Candid, thank you for the superchat.

4453
03:36:22,490 --> 03:36:22,930
Thank you.

4454
03:36:23,050 --> 03:36:23,610
Thank you.

4455
03:36:23,990 --> 03:36:26,370
Atlas, thank you for the superchat.

4456
03:36:26,630 --> 03:36:27,010
Thank you.

4457
03:36:27,150 --> 03:36:27,850
Thank you.

4458
03:36:28,210 --> 03:36:33,110
I forgot to add the homo in the end.

4459
03:36:33,370 --> 03:36:34,030
Or did they?

4460
03:36:34,190 --> 03:36:36,010
Thank you for the superchat, Atlas.

4461
03:36:36,130 --> 03:36:36,450
Thank you.

4462
03:36:36,510 --> 03:36:37,010
Thank you.

4463
03:36:37,550 --> 03:36:39,050
Fudgetop, thank you for the superchat.

4464
03:36:39,170 --> 03:36:39,410
Thank you.

4465
03:36:39,490 --> 03:36:41,570
Just really good roommates, guys!

4466
03:36:43,350 --> 03:36:46,690
Just incredibly good roommates, everybody.

4467
03:36:47,010 --> 03:36:48,770
Thank you for the superchat.

4468
03:36:48,870 --> 03:36:49,270
Thank you.

4469
03:36:49,390 --> 03:36:50,050
Thank you.

4470
03:36:50,230 --> 03:36:52,350
Oh, I am definitely not level 12.

4471
03:36:55,430 --> 03:36:56,550
Oh my god.

4472
03:36:56,690 --> 03:36:58,070
Sorry, that like actually...

4473
03:36:58,690 --> 03:36:59,950
I'm so sorry.

4474
03:36:59,950 --> 03:37:00,110
Alright.

4475
03:37:05,070 --> 03:37:07,410
I was just not ready.

4476
03:37:07,890 --> 03:37:09,330
I was not ready today.

4477
03:37:12,190 --> 03:37:15,810
There's been some wild shit going on.

4478
03:37:18,390 --> 03:37:22,890
Okay, let's get rid of all the low level spheres.

4479
03:37:26,630 --> 03:37:28,250
It's just been wild.

4480
03:37:28,250 --> 03:37:29,330
What can I say?

4481
03:37:29,530 --> 03:37:31,250
It's just been pretty wild.

4482
03:37:34,270 --> 03:37:35,530
Vitality pill.

4483
03:37:35,950 --> 03:37:36,750
Oh man.

4484
03:37:39,940 --> 03:37:42,090
Sometimes people need a little bit of help, okay?

4485
03:37:43,490 --> 03:37:46,050
I would do attack, honestly.

4486
03:37:46,410 --> 03:37:47,290
I'll grab the attack.

4487
03:37:50,820 --> 03:37:51,100
Alright.

4488
03:37:53,710 --> 03:37:56,300
Yeah, definitely bring some of those.

4489
03:37:58,760 --> 03:38:01,300
I'll put the strength pill in.

4490
03:38:04,280 --> 03:38:05,760
I still like a 48.

4491
03:38:06,060 --> 03:38:07,940
There you go.

4492
03:38:09,060 --> 03:38:10,820
Guys, it was not like this.

4493
03:38:10,900 --> 03:38:13,560
I swear to god, it was not like this before.

4494
03:38:13,800 --> 03:38:14,000
Guys.

4495
03:38:14,740 --> 03:38:23,420
Guys, the previous Dynasty Warriors was definitely less suggestive.

4496
03:38:23,600 --> 03:38:25,120
Guys, I swear to god.

4497
03:38:25,120 --> 03:38:25,980
I...

4498
03:38:25,980 --> 03:38:28,940
I swear to god.

4499
03:38:29,440 --> 03:38:30,180
This...

4500
03:38:30,180 --> 03:38:32,140
This has been pretty wild.

4501
03:38:35,940 --> 03:38:38,600
This has been pretty wild.

4502
03:38:41,120 --> 03:38:43,300
Alright, suppression of Yu province.

4503
03:38:43,480 --> 03:38:46,260
The traitor Chongchong has caused an uprising in your province.

4504
03:38:46,760 --> 03:38:48,240
Quell the rebellion with Liu Bei.

4505
03:38:49,540 --> 03:38:50,380
But the novel!

4506
03:38:50,780 --> 03:38:53,700
The novel did have some romance in there.

4507
03:39:03,660 --> 03:39:04,180
Oh.

4508
03:39:05,620 --> 03:39:06,580
Thanks, Liu Bei.

4509
03:39:08,480 --> 03:39:11,360
That sentence could have been rewritten a different way.

4510
03:39:16,440 --> 03:39:18,760
You could have been like, I'm glad you arrived.

4511
03:39:58,100 --> 03:39:59,240
You know what's crazy?

4512
03:40:00,460 --> 03:40:03,960
Gonfey is actually an aristocrat and he's really fucking rich.

4513
03:40:04,140 --> 03:40:06,460
But instead, he lets Lu Bei be poor.

4514
03:40:24,100 --> 03:40:25,260
Real bros.

4515
03:40:26,780 --> 03:40:33,480
Oh Yeah, not aristocrat he's uh, he's He's a butcher.

4516
03:40:33,700 --> 03:40:33,980
Sorry.

4517
03:40:34,280 --> 03:40:35,440
Yeah, he's a butcher.

4518
03:40:35,920 --> 03:40:37,160
Not aristocrat.

4519
03:40:37,220 --> 03:40:40,600
He was a butcher and so he was like he was incredibly rich.

4520
03:41:16,330 --> 03:41:24,530
I feel like butchers would make a lot because like, uh, food is always scarce and stuff and meat was expensive back then.

4521
03:41:26,730 --> 03:41:28,130
Okay.

4522
03:42:03,490 --> 03:42:07,250
Okay, but as I mentioned before, we're still unaware of Wuhan's movement.

4523
03:42:08,050 --> 03:42:08,590
That's fine.

4524
03:42:08,870 --> 03:42:12,510
This is why I want not Doki and Guan Yu to move freely around the battlefield.

4525
03:42:12,870 --> 03:42:15,150
Okay, so I can just go wherever they want.

4526
03:42:15,390 --> 03:42:15,930
Very well.

4527
03:42:17,270 --> 03:42:18,910
I can handle this myself.

4528
03:42:18,990 --> 03:42:20,390
I don't need no Guan Yu.

4529
03:42:23,070 --> 03:42:25,250
He's just gonna oh wait JK.

4530
03:42:25,510 --> 03:42:26,610
Oh wait JK.

4531
03:42:26,750 --> 03:42:26,930
JK.

4532
03:42:27,030 --> 03:42:27,670
I can be Guan Yu.

4533
03:42:27,770 --> 03:42:28,350
Never mind.

4534
03:42:28,410 --> 03:42:31,710
I don't want Never mind.

4535
03:42:31,750 --> 03:42:32,650
I won't be Guan Yu.

4536
03:42:32,810 --> 03:42:33,470
Never mind.

4537
03:42:33,490 --> 03:42:34,730
I didn't realize I could be him.

4538
03:42:35,090 --> 03:42:39,910
Come with me Guan Yu.

4539
03:42:44,570 --> 03:42:47,190
All right, how do I become him again, I don't remember.

4540
03:42:53,610 --> 03:42:55,330
Wait, how do I become him guys?

4541
03:42:55,430 --> 03:42:55,810
I forgot.

4542
03:42:56,090 --> 03:42:57,330
I forgot how to...

4543
03:42:59,710 --> 03:43:02,110
Why the fuck would I have to be the non-main character?

4544
03:43:02,470 --> 03:43:04,830
I want to be a guy that become a guy.

4545
03:43:06,610 --> 03:43:08,250
Now moving towards the summit.

4546
03:43:11,390 --> 03:43:13,310
Oh my god, how do I become you?

4547
03:43:13,510 --> 03:43:15,170
I want to become you!

4548
03:43:17,810 --> 03:43:20,370
Oh Only for a little while.

4549
03:43:20,450 --> 03:43:21,630
What's the point?

4550
03:43:22,010 --> 03:43:24,210
What what the fuck is the point?

4551
03:43:33,530 --> 03:43:36,390
What's the point if I can't be Guan Yu?

4552
03:43:37,070 --> 03:43:38,570
What's the point?

4553
03:43:40,370 --> 03:43:42,450
Oh shit, that is cool.

4554
03:43:46,330 --> 03:43:48,450
It truly is pain.

4555
03:43:51,810 --> 03:43:53,270
Alright, let's get rid of these guys.

4556
03:43:54,270 --> 03:43:55,130
Wait, why are you running away?

4557
03:43:56,850 --> 03:43:58,730
Why are you already running away like a cow?

4558
03:44:01,830 --> 03:44:03,010
That's fucking right.

4559
03:44:03,790 --> 03:44:05,370
Your friends ran.

4560
03:44:07,850 --> 03:44:10,930
That's right, he watched you run!

4561
03:44:18,510 --> 03:44:20,790
Alright, nice.

4562
03:44:22,410 --> 03:44:23,650
I'm gonna pursue them.

4563
03:44:25,350 --> 03:44:26,370
I ain't no coward!

4564
03:44:30,170 --> 03:44:31,730
You coward, Lupe!

4565
03:44:31,890 --> 03:44:32,610
Keep going!

4566
03:44:37,950 --> 03:44:42,390
Well, there's an empty area in front of me, I wonder what's gonna happen over there.

4567
03:44:46,690 --> 03:44:47,570
Okay, nice.

4568
03:44:48,990 --> 03:44:49,750
Oh shit.

4569
03:44:50,590 --> 03:44:51,130
Oh shit.

4570
03:44:51,730 --> 03:44:52,690
It's okay, I'm okay.

4571
03:44:59,130 --> 03:44:59,610
Nice.

4572
03:45:00,070 --> 03:45:00,850
Broke his thing.

4573
03:45:01,630 --> 03:45:04,290
Come on, you think you're good at this game?

4574
03:45:04,770 --> 03:45:05,690
I am not!

4575
03:45:05,830 --> 03:45:08,090
I am an NPC, but I'm still better than you.

4576
03:45:11,650 --> 03:45:12,410
Wait, what?

4577
03:45:13,550 --> 03:45:14,030
Wheels.

4578
03:45:14,510 --> 03:45:16,050
Wheels are dual-wielded weapons.

4579
03:45:16,230 --> 03:45:17,710
Oh, I got a new weapon.

4580
03:45:18,590 --> 03:45:20,290
Oh my god, this is my favorite weapon!

4581
03:45:20,370 --> 03:45:21,470
This is actually my favorite weapon.

4582
03:45:22,750 --> 03:45:28,810
This was my favorite weapon back when the game first came out.

4583
03:45:29,370 --> 03:45:30,550
Or like, Dynasty Warriors 2.

4584
03:45:32,190 --> 03:45:34,870
It's actually the best weapon.

4585
03:45:36,270 --> 03:45:36,750
Wait.

4586
03:45:38,470 --> 03:45:39,450
It's her weapon.

4587
03:45:39,570 --> 03:45:41,370
Yeah, it's Sun Shan Shan's weapon.

4588
03:45:42,410 --> 03:45:45,910
We'll make those worms regret invading our land.

4589
03:45:48,370 --> 03:45:50,170
Oh no, is it wartime?

4590
03:45:50,310 --> 03:45:51,030
Oh no.

4591
03:45:51,250 --> 03:45:53,010
Oh, that's a lot of people!

4592
03:45:53,750 --> 03:45:55,170
Okay, let's grab it.

4593
03:45:55,510 --> 03:45:57,070
What's the power level though?

4594
03:45:57,910 --> 03:45:59,050
Oh, it's 45?

4595
03:46:02,330 --> 03:46:04,630
I'll use it just cuz I can right now.

4596
03:46:06,370 --> 03:46:08,130
I'll just use it just cuz I can.

4597
03:46:08,910 --> 03:46:11,730
I normally wouldn't because like...

4598
03:46:12,930 --> 03:46:15,890
Because my other one is just so much stronger, so...

4599
03:46:21,210 --> 03:46:21,650
Nice.

4600
03:46:22,010 --> 03:46:22,510
Wait, what?

4601
03:46:22,770 --> 03:46:23,290
Oh, nice.

4602
03:46:24,290 --> 03:46:25,670
Oh, it looks so cool though.

4603
03:46:25,770 --> 03:46:26,930
Oh, it looks so cool!

4604
03:46:30,910 --> 03:46:32,370
It looks so cool!

4605
03:46:32,710 --> 03:46:34,750
Oh my god, look at it go!

4606
03:46:38,230 --> 03:46:40,130
Wait, how do I become Guan Yun again, guys?

4607
03:46:41,730 --> 03:46:44,050
Lord Gongsun Zan will soon be in grave danger.

4608
03:46:44,370 --> 03:46:46,990
You must go to his aid before the enemy surrounds him.

4609
03:46:47,370 --> 03:46:48,350
Let it rip.

4610
03:46:49,010 --> 03:46:50,770
Let it fucking rip!

4611
03:46:52,370 --> 03:46:53,490
That's great!

4612
03:46:55,290 --> 03:46:55,850
Spin!

4613
03:46:58,670 --> 03:46:59,230
Spin!

4614
03:47:01,670 --> 03:47:02,590
Oh shit!

4615
03:47:02,730 --> 03:47:07,470
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, I didn't realize.

4616
03:47:07,910 --> 03:47:09,490
Oh, I forgot about our commander.

4617
03:47:09,970 --> 03:47:11,710
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

4618
03:47:11,730 --> 03:47:12,690
I'm heading over.

4619
03:47:13,890 --> 03:47:16,050
Oh, I forgot about our commander.

4620
03:47:16,730 --> 03:47:19,190
Opportunity to fight back with our own might.

4621
03:47:19,730 --> 03:47:20,510
Oh, I'm heading over.

4622
03:47:20,650 --> 03:47:21,210
I'm heading over.

4623
03:47:21,410 --> 03:47:22,550
I'm heading- oh shit!

4624
03:47:22,770 --> 03:47:23,830
Oh, I'm out!

4625
03:47:24,210 --> 03:47:25,330
Oh, my god, stop!

4626
03:47:27,670 --> 03:47:30,230
Okay, that was awkward.

4627
03:47:30,790 --> 03:47:32,230
That was actually awkward.

4628
03:47:33,950 --> 03:47:35,630
We have come to provide reinforcements.

4629
03:47:35,990 --> 03:47:38,270
Turn the table.

4630
03:47:38,270 --> 03:47:38,950
Nice.

4631
03:47:40,530 --> 03:47:47,410
That was like a fucking- It was like a fucking- like a wave.

4632
03:47:48,970 --> 03:47:50,550
Yeah, I need to go this way.

4633
03:47:50,650 --> 03:47:51,270
I need help.

4634
03:47:52,110 --> 03:47:54,070
Sorry guys, I need to go help.

4635
03:47:57,090 --> 03:48:00,990
All right, look, I gotta help, like, the main guy.

4636
03:48:01,250 --> 03:48:08,070
Guys, I- Look, it's fine as long as our main commander is alive.

4637
03:48:08,070 --> 03:48:08,950
That's fine.

4638
03:48:11,710 --> 03:48:13,070
Oh, please, please.

4639
03:48:13,290 --> 03:48:16,950
I'm- I need to make sure these guys are okay first.

4640
03:48:19,110 --> 03:48:19,790
Okay, wait.

4641
03:48:22,070 --> 03:48:25,170
All right, we have to figure out these guys first.

4642
03:48:26,170 --> 03:48:27,230
Oh, I can beat him!

4643
03:48:27,890 --> 03:48:28,690
What fun is this?

4644
03:48:29,710 --> 03:48:31,410
Okay, let me get rid of him first.

4645
03:48:33,210 --> 03:48:35,950
Wait, actually, I wanted- I don't mean to use him yet.

4646
03:48:36,030 --> 03:48:37,290
I don't waste him on these guys.

4647
03:48:37,290 --> 03:48:38,810
These guys are nothing but nobodies.

4648
03:48:40,310 --> 03:48:43,190
Oh my god, please, I don't- Okay, wait, wait, wait.

4649
03:48:43,350 --> 03:48:44,190
Changing characters.

4650
03:48:44,570 --> 03:48:45,770
Fuck it, we gotta do this fast.

4651
03:48:46,130 --> 03:48:47,930
We gotta play a real hero now.

4652
03:48:48,010 --> 03:48:49,350
We can finally be the main character.

4653
03:48:49,990 --> 03:48:51,110
That's fucking right.

4654
03:48:51,870 --> 03:48:52,310
Wait.

4655
03:48:53,710 --> 03:48:54,450
That's right.

4656
03:48:54,910 --> 03:48:57,290
I am the main character for real now.

4657
03:48:59,230 --> 03:49:05,490
Okay, noobie, look, I- Please, please, I- I can't be everywhere.

4658
03:49:09,350 --> 03:49:10,110
Oh no.

4659
03:49:11,130 --> 03:49:13,130
Yeah, he does a lot of fucking damage.

4660
03:49:13,370 --> 03:49:14,070
Holy shit.

4661
03:49:14,410 --> 03:49:16,210
He- oh my god.

4662
03:49:18,710 --> 03:49:20,050
All right, nice.

4663
03:49:20,750 --> 03:49:24,050
Okay, I'm done.

4664
03:49:24,730 --> 03:49:27,130
But like, I'm still go- wait, how do I cancel this?

4665
03:49:27,990 --> 03:49:28,550
Oh fuck.

4666
03:49:28,670 --> 03:49:29,710
Oh, that's awkward.

4667
03:49:29,950 --> 03:49:30,250
Okay.

4668
03:49:30,810 --> 03:49:31,690
I didn't mean to do that.

4669
03:49:33,650 --> 03:49:35,110
Look, they were all dead.

4670
03:49:35,150 --> 03:49:36,370
I couldn't do anything else.

4671
03:49:36,710 --> 03:49:37,270
Okay, guys.

4672
03:49:38,410 --> 03:49:39,690
They were all dead.

4673
03:49:39,810 --> 03:49:40,950
Like, what was I supposed to do?

4674
03:49:41,470 --> 03:49:43,470
All right, uh, wait, I cannot change?

4675
03:49:46,250 --> 03:49:49,750
Okay, I'm gonna go back to this sword, cuz uh...

4676
03:49:49,750 --> 03:49:50,710
Because it's stronger.

4677
03:49:52,270 --> 03:49:57,590
I'd love to use the spin, but like, the other weapon is just- are you serious?

4678
03:50:01,050 --> 03:50:02,270
Are you serious?

4679
03:50:02,370 --> 03:50:04,470
There's another guy heading over?

4680
03:50:04,950 --> 03:50:05,910
Oh no.

4681
03:50:07,630 --> 03:50:08,870
Oh, I'm cheering up.

4682
03:50:09,050 --> 03:50:09,890
Cheer, cheer, cheer, cheer, cheer.

4683
03:50:10,510 --> 03:50:11,450
Cheer, cheer, cheer, cheer, cheer.

4684
03:50:13,330 --> 03:50:16,230
Oh my god, there's too many people!

4685
03:50:19,970 --> 03:50:21,570
I'm stuck, Gwon-Yoon!

4686
03:50:24,550 --> 03:50:26,010
Okay, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

4687
03:50:26,110 --> 03:50:29,430
Sorry, I gotta- I'm freaking- I'm freaking out right now.

4688
03:50:29,810 --> 03:50:32,830
I'm actually- I'm freaking out.

4689
03:50:39,510 --> 03:50:47,530
Oh my god, and I have to go back to save- I have to go back to save the general after too!

4690
03:50:48,930 --> 03:50:49,450
Please!

4691
03:50:53,430 --> 03:50:55,350
Like, I can't do everything!

4692
03:50:58,550 --> 03:51:00,230
Oh my god, please.

4693
03:51:03,130 --> 03:51:05,850
Okay, I hope Gwon-Yoon is like, helping me out.

4694
03:51:05,930 --> 03:51:06,350
Like, I-

4695
03:51:09,370 --> 03:51:15,970
I hope he's helping, I- I feel like I'm doing everything myself right now.

4696
03:51:17,830 --> 03:51:20,590
So I hope he's helping out right now, honestly.

4697
03:51:22,290 --> 03:51:23,570
That's fucking right.

4698
03:51:27,850 --> 03:51:29,490
Alright, thank god.

4699
03:51:33,010 --> 03:51:37,750
I don't know what Gwon-Yoon is doing, but he better be fucking doing enough.

4700
03:51:40,350 --> 03:51:42,970
Alright, Gwon-Yoon, let's get this general.

4701
03:51:46,450 --> 03:51:48,990
Alright, this is looking a little rough though.

4702
03:51:49,670 --> 03:51:53,570
Not gonna lie, it is looking a little rough.

4703
03:51:56,210 --> 03:51:59,330
Okay, okay, now- now we have to go back!

4704
03:51:59,470 --> 03:52:00,690
Alright, back we go!

4705
03:52:01,890 --> 03:52:03,470
Back we go!

4706
03:52:03,590 --> 03:52:06,370
We gotta go back, because our leader needs help again!

4707
03:52:07,410 --> 03:52:09,030
We gotta go back!

4708
03:52:10,810 --> 03:52:12,710
Oh my god!

4709
03:52:14,530 --> 03:52:16,710
Alright, here we go again!

4710
03:52:18,930 --> 03:52:20,410
Off we go!

4711
03:52:22,510 --> 03:52:24,190
Oh my god.

4712
03:52:26,970 --> 03:52:28,870
Okay, right here.

4713
03:52:31,970 --> 03:52:33,230
Okay, we're fine.

4714
03:52:36,470 --> 03:52:39,370
Look, I've been through a lot, alright?

4715
03:52:39,890 --> 03:52:49,830
Buddy, I- You're like, no but- I defeated a fucking wizard, you think you're like- you think I care about you?

4716
03:52:50,310 --> 03:52:52,930
I literally killed a wizard today!

4717
03:52:54,170 --> 03:52:55,210
He threw rocks!

4718
03:52:55,310 --> 03:52:56,810
He was an actual earthbender!

4719
03:52:56,950 --> 03:53:03,870
I thought they were- I thought magic- I didn't believe in magic, but then now- Now I'm a believer after what I saw today.

4720
03:53:06,130 --> 03:53:07,070
You're not him.

4721
03:53:07,590 --> 03:53:09,070
Oh shit, that's not what I wanted to do.

4722
03:53:09,190 --> 03:53:13,470
I was trying to press- I wanted to press Y, but it's alright.

4723
03:53:14,210 --> 03:53:15,310
I can kill him now.

4724
03:53:18,350 --> 03:53:18,710
Nice.

4725
03:53:19,010 --> 03:53:20,190
Okay, there's one more officer.

4726
03:53:21,270 --> 03:53:22,190
Alright, we just gotta get him.

4727
03:53:23,670 --> 03:53:25,030
Alright, get over here- oh shit!

4728
03:53:26,710 --> 03:53:28,790
Wait, did he parry me?!

4729
03:53:28,790 --> 03:53:30,050
Oh shit!

4730
03:53:31,350 --> 03:53:32,930
He can do that?!

4731
03:53:34,950 --> 03:53:35,930
Okay, nice.

4732
03:53:36,970 --> 03:53:38,610
I got my insane sword now.

4733
03:53:41,710 --> 03:53:42,350
Wait, what?

4734
03:53:43,610 --> 03:53:47,310
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa!

4735
03:53:47,590 --> 03:53:49,570
Whoa, whoa, whoa, stranger danger!

4736
03:53:50,190 --> 03:53:50,630
Whoa!

4737
03:53:52,090 --> 03:53:56,990
I have no idea what he was trying to do, but he- that scared me.

4738
03:53:59,030 --> 03:54:01,870
Wait, he was the boss?!

4739
03:54:01,870 --> 03:54:02,530
Oh shit!

4740
03:54:02,710 --> 03:54:03,370
Oh, I did it!

4741
03:54:03,430 --> 03:54:03,730
Nice.

4742
03:54:05,530 --> 03:54:07,270
I didn't even know he was the main guy.

4743
03:54:09,510 --> 03:54:10,070
Nice.

4744
03:54:11,190 --> 03:54:13,150
Oh, it was a command grab!

4745
03:54:20,670 --> 03:54:21,790
Thank you.

4746
03:54:22,030 --> 03:54:22,770
Thank you, Guardian.

4747
03:54:25,630 --> 03:54:26,150
That's me!

4748
03:54:26,870 --> 03:54:27,550
That's me!

4749
03:54:27,850 --> 03:54:29,590
But yeah, why am I not the main character?

4750
03:54:29,590 --> 03:54:29,790
Thank you!

4751
03:54:32,310 --> 03:54:34,470
Enables wheel recovery in mid-air?

4752
03:54:35,170 --> 03:54:36,350
Oh, that's cool.

4753
03:54:36,530 --> 03:54:37,270
That looks cool.

4754
03:54:43,800 --> 03:54:44,440
Nice.

4755
03:54:44,600 --> 03:54:44,820
Alright.

4756
03:54:46,200 --> 03:54:47,900
We have more bravery now.

4757
03:54:50,880 --> 03:54:51,520
Nice.

4758
03:54:52,740 --> 03:54:53,180
Nice.

4759
03:54:56,040 --> 03:54:59,320
Okay, uh... Restores to a set amount upon reach.

4760
03:54:59,380 --> 03:55:00,680
Okay, we definitely need that.

4761
03:55:01,720 --> 03:55:04,240
Uh, I'm gonna max out this first.

4762
03:55:18,730 --> 03:55:20,730
Okay, you two has died.

4763
03:55:21,350 --> 03:55:24,870
You two lost to the small guys.

4764
03:55:25,950 --> 03:55:28,410
Guardian, I had to fucking run back and forth.

4765
03:55:30,290 --> 03:55:31,570
You got your butt kicked.

4766
03:55:45,230 --> 03:55:45,630
Nice.

4767
03:55:46,250 --> 03:55:48,770
We did such a good job, guys, right?

4768
03:56:11,850 --> 03:56:14,770
I said, no match for us.

4769
03:56:15,110 --> 03:56:16,490
Gamrage, thank you for the superchat.

4770
03:56:16,550 --> 03:56:17,350
Thank you, thank you.

4771
03:56:18,410 --> 03:56:18,570
What?

4772
03:56:34,230 --> 03:56:35,430
That's good to know.

4773
03:56:37,290 --> 03:56:39,650
But all of these are rejections.

4774
03:56:40,350 --> 03:56:40,350
Perhaps.

4775
03:56:40,990 --> 03:56:41,510
Maybe.

4776
03:56:42,090 --> 03:56:43,490
Well, that's good to know.

4777
03:56:43,690 --> 03:56:45,150
And then, zero reply.

4778
03:56:45,510 --> 03:56:47,430
Okay, I'll do like... Yeah, that's cool.

4779
03:56:50,850 --> 03:56:52,090
True, that's cool.

4780
03:57:02,310 --> 03:57:04,130
I'm just playing hard to get, guys.

4781
03:57:04,210 --> 03:57:05,830
I want them to want me.

4782
03:57:09,760 --> 03:57:11,410
I'm just being elusive.

4783
03:57:12,800 --> 03:57:13,190
Whoa!

4784
03:57:21,200 --> 03:57:22,500
Oh, whoa!

4785
03:57:23,000 --> 03:57:23,620
Whoa.

4786
03:57:24,460 --> 03:57:27,260
Oh, I always have time for you, Guardian.

4787
03:57:38,660 --> 03:57:39,980
It's time.

4788
03:57:40,140 --> 03:57:41,540
We've unlocked a new route.

4789
03:57:52,840 --> 03:57:54,600
My heart.

4790
03:57:56,980 --> 03:58:00,140
This dating sim is winning me over.

4791
03:58:09,260 --> 03:58:10,080
Perhaps so.

4792
03:58:16,340 --> 03:58:19,220
Guys, do you guys feel this tension between me and Guan Yu right now?

4793
03:58:19,580 --> 03:58:20,020
Yeah.

4794
03:58:39,840 --> 03:58:44,060
Therefore, I need a great leader to whom I can dedicate my efforts.

4795
03:58:44,980 --> 03:58:48,400
In that, I am lucky indeed to have Liu Bei.

4796
03:58:49,300 --> 03:58:55,140
My only worry is that his ambitions are so great that they might overpower my imagination entirely.

4797
03:59:00,050 --> 03:59:01,670
Does he have what it takes?

4798
03:59:01,930 --> 03:59:03,530
I'm not s- Aw, man.

4799
03:59:04,750 --> 03:59:05,450
He's not.

4800
03:59:05,530 --> 03:59:06,390
He's so mediocre.

4801
03:59:06,570 --> 03:59:07,430
I'm not gonna lie.

4802
03:59:07,730 --> 03:59:08,570
I'm sorry.

4803
03:59:08,890 --> 03:59:10,530
He's such a mediocre leader.

4804
03:59:14,350 --> 03:59:16,630
Well, I guess you just gotta convince me, Guan Yu.

4805
03:59:16,850 --> 03:59:17,590
I'm sorry.

4806
03:59:29,630 --> 03:59:30,890
Toki, no.

4807
03:59:34,210 --> 03:59:36,110
Then, let's keep talking.

4808
03:59:40,240 --> 03:59:43,390
I feel they're both the same, but which one's more rowdy?

4809
03:59:43,550 --> 03:59:45,390
Which one would Guan Yu like more?

4810
03:59:46,230 --> 03:59:48,990
But yeah, I found myself wanting to talk more.

4811
03:59:49,470 --> 03:59:50,750
Oh my god, Guan Yu.

4812
03:59:50,850 --> 03:59:56,600
I feel like anything I say is not as bad as the official...

4813
03:59:57,470 --> 03:59:58,110
Choices.

4814
03:59:58,450 --> 04:00:01,630
Like, the official choices are like...

4815
04:00:03,190 --> 04:00:06,930
The official choices feel so much worse.

4816
04:00:14,350 --> 04:00:14,890
Wow!

4817
04:00:15,910 --> 04:00:16,710
Okay.

4818
04:00:35,990 --> 04:00:37,310
What?!

4819
04:00:43,210 --> 04:00:45,530
They just cut it like that?!

4820
04:00:46,670 --> 04:00:48,810
What just happened?!

4821
04:00:48,810 --> 04:00:51,470
What just happened?!

4822
04:00:52,330 --> 04:00:54,350
Oh my god!

4823
04:00:54,710 --> 04:00:56,790
What just happened?!

4824
04:00:57,470 --> 04:00:59,850
Oh my god!

4825
04:01:02,130 --> 04:01:03,850
Oh my god!

4826
04:01:03,890 --> 04:01:05,470
What the fuck just happened?!

4827
04:01:13,270 --> 04:01:23,010
He wanted to etch my face and my voice so he could remember it before I left!

4828
04:01:23,010 --> 04:01:23,870
What

4829
04:01:29,080 --> 04:01:30,100
just happened?!

4830
04:01:30,100 --> 04:01:33,120
Maybe he pursued you.

4831
04:01:35,140 --> 04:01:36,960
Oh my god!

4832
04:01:37,060 --> 04:01:39,480
Why did they just cut it like that?!

4833
04:01:40,280 --> 04:01:42,020
Oh my god!

4834
04:01:43,100 --> 04:01:45,260
Why did they just stop?

4835
04:01:45,580 --> 04:01:46,560
Oh my god!

4836
04:01:46,660 --> 04:01:48,220
The scene ends there?!

4837
04:01:50,460 --> 04:01:52,400
Oh my god!

4838
04:01:55,380 --> 04:01:56,240
Oh my god!

4839
04:01:56,240 --> 04:02:01,740
Unfortunately, if I was for a while, I wouldn't have this as something to remember me by.

4840
04:02:06,980 --> 04:02:09,640
Oh my god.

4841
04:02:09,640 --> 04:02:11,000
I'm gonna call it there.

4842
04:02:11,240 --> 04:02:13,240
That was a wild scene.

4843
04:02:13,880 --> 04:02:17,640
That was actually fucking wild.

4844
04:02:18,040 --> 04:02:20,160
I don't think I... Guys, I'm...

4845
04:02:21,160 --> 04:02:27,160
Guys, I don't think... I don't think... That was wild.

4846
04:02:27,760 --> 04:02:30,540
That was actually fucking wild.

4847
04:02:30,940 --> 04:02:33,440
I can't... I need to rest up after that.

4848
04:02:33,680 --> 04:02:36,080
I'm just fucking around.

4849
04:02:36,680 --> 04:02:46,400
But the official dialogue and the official cutscenes are so much worse than anything I can say.

4850
04:02:46,400 --> 04:02:51,240
And it catches me off guard every time.

4851
04:02:55,080 --> 04:02:56,680
Oh my god.

4852
04:02:56,980 --> 04:03:02,600
It catches me off guard every time they say that.

4853
04:03:03,420 --> 04:03:04,840
Oh my god.

4854
04:03:05,720 --> 04:03:07,540
Raze, thank you for the superchat.

4855
04:03:07,620 --> 04:03:08,400
Thank you, thank you.

4856
04:03:08,460 --> 04:03:14,020
I didn't know until right now that Dynasty Warriors was real like that.

4857
04:03:14,020 --> 04:03:16,220
Thank you for the superchat.

4858
04:03:16,400 --> 04:03:18,060
Thank you, thank you, Raze.

4859
04:03:18,680 --> 04:03:20,840
Oh my god.

4860
04:03:21,000 --> 04:03:22,480
Nexy, thank you for the superchat.

4861
04:03:22,580 --> 04:03:23,160
Thank you, thank you.

4862
04:03:23,180 --> 04:03:25,220
I can't believe how bad that got.

4863
04:03:25,380 --> 04:03:31,040
I was joking and then it just got so much worse.

4864
04:03:33,640 --> 04:03:35,460
Oh my god.

4865
04:03:36,740 --> 04:03:38,120
Oh my god.

4866
04:03:38,200 --> 04:03:43,580
Bro, the fucking people who translated this knew exactly what they were doing.

4867
04:03:46,280 --> 04:03:50,200
They knew exactly what they were doing.

4868
04:03:50,720 --> 04:03:51,760
Oh my god.

4869
04:03:55,280 --> 04:03:56,800
Oh my god, finally.

4870
04:03:57,700 --> 04:04:01,960
I've always wanted the romance in Romance in the Three Kingdoms.

4871
04:04:01,960 --> 04:04:05,240
I always, I've always wanted this.

4872
04:04:07,140 --> 04:04:10,200
That's what we were missing out on, guys.

4873
04:04:10,680 --> 04:04:14,160
It's what we've been missing out this entire time.

4874
04:04:15,240 --> 04:04:16,580
Oh my god.

4875
04:04:19,760 --> 04:04:21,380
Oh my god.

4876
04:04:21,940 --> 04:04:23,460
Zekra, thank you for the superchat.

4877
04:04:23,660 --> 04:04:24,420
Thank you, thank you.

4878
04:04:24,580 --> 04:04:26,180
10 out of 10 stories.

4879
04:04:26,180 --> 04:04:27,940
Thank you for the superchat.

4880
04:04:28,240 --> 04:04:31,760
Atlas, thank you for the superchat.

4881
04:04:32,120 --> 04:04:32,900
Thank you, thank you.

4882
04:04:33,500 --> 04:04:36,700
Guys, it's just bromance, guys.

4883
04:04:37,080 --> 04:04:40,380
It's just bromance, everybody.

4884
04:04:40,880 --> 04:04:48,200
Well, I think this was a good... I think this was a good part to call it, guys.

4885
04:04:48,340 --> 04:04:52,180
I think that cutscene between me and Guan Yin...

4886
04:04:56,780 --> 04:04:59,280
I don't know if I could keep going after that.

4887
04:04:59,360 --> 04:05:01,440
I think that was the highest note I could end.

4888
04:05:01,820 --> 04:05:10,460
We still have yet to pursue... We still have yet to pursue Lu Bu, but like...

4889
04:05:10,460 --> 04:05:14,760
I'm too... I think that was the highest note I could end on.

4890
04:05:14,760 --> 04:05:15,500
I...

4891
04:05:22,220 --> 04:05:23,500
That really...

4892
04:05:23,500 --> 04:05:25,880
What a way to end.

4893
04:05:26,560 --> 04:05:27,980
Oh my god.

4894
04:05:29,180 --> 04:05:30,520
Oh my god.

4895
04:05:30,900 --> 04:05:32,380
Yeah, so okay.

4896
04:05:32,680 --> 04:05:34,760
I'll be posting my schedule tonight, because...

4897
04:05:37,540 --> 04:05:42,880
Alright, so it was actually... It's a collab with Doobie, but she couldn't do it this week.

4898
04:05:42,880 --> 04:05:49,260
So we're gonna be doing it next week or the week after, because I'm...

4899
04:05:49,260 --> 04:05:51,980
I don't know if I'm gonna be available next week.

4900
04:05:52,320 --> 04:05:56,800
But we're gonna be doing Marvel Rivals with Doobie either next week or the week after.

4901
04:05:57,220 --> 04:06:00,480
So that was a collab that we were trying to arrange.

4902
04:06:01,260 --> 04:06:04,080
But yes, so this week, there's no collabs this week.

4903
04:06:05,240 --> 04:06:08,120
But it's either next week or the week after with Doobie.

4904
04:06:10,040 --> 04:06:10,560
Anyway...

4905
04:06:13,120 --> 04:06:15,140
Yeah, it's just me and Doobie duoing.

4906
04:06:16,020 --> 04:06:18,400
And I'll be playing DPS, because I'll be playing on an alt account.

4907
04:06:18,620 --> 04:06:20,220
Because I think she's like... She's like gold, right?

4908
04:06:20,280 --> 04:06:21,780
I think she's gold right now.

4909
04:06:21,820 --> 04:06:22,980
I asked her what her rank is.

4910
04:06:23,380 --> 04:06:24,800
And she said she's gold at the moment.

4911
04:06:25,080 --> 04:06:28,980
So I'll most likely be playing DPS on like a silver account or something.

4912
04:06:29,900 --> 04:06:31,140
Ani, thank you for the superchat.

4913
04:06:31,200 --> 04:06:31,860
Thank you, thank you.

4914
04:06:31,920 --> 04:06:34,720
I can't wait to see how the Pursuit of Lubu will go now.

4915
04:06:34,860 --> 04:06:37,060
Guys, that's not what it means!

4916
04:06:37,500 --> 04:06:40,520
That's not what Pursuit of Lubu does not mean that.

4917
04:06:40,520 --> 04:06:42,560
Thank you for the superchat.

4918
04:06:42,620 --> 04:06:43,880
Thank you, thank you.

4919
04:06:45,280 --> 04:06:47,420
So, welcome to the tomato farm.

4920
04:06:47,600 --> 04:06:48,640
Welcome, welcome.

4921
04:06:50,400 --> 04:06:52,520
I guess, shielding-wise...

4922
04:06:53,080 --> 04:06:54,880
If you guys...

4923
04:06:54,880 --> 04:06:59,080
The merch for my concert pre-order stuff ends next week.

4924
04:06:59,520 --> 04:07:01,560
So, you know...

4925
04:07:01,560 --> 04:07:05,960
Pre-order your concert merch before it's gone forever.

4926
04:07:06,700 --> 04:07:10,260
Even if you didn't go to the concert, you can still pre-order the merch.

4927
04:07:10,260 --> 04:07:13,260
Anyway guys, I'm gonna call it here now.

4928
04:07:13,380 --> 04:07:16,380
As always everybody, that was a fun time.

4929
04:07:16,940 --> 04:07:20,100
As always everybody, stay hydrated.

4930
04:07:20,900 --> 04:07:21,600
Posture check.

4931
04:07:22,100 --> 04:07:23,160
Get up and move around.

4932
04:07:23,260 --> 04:07:24,300
Get that blood flowing.

4933
04:07:24,500 --> 04:07:26,340
You stand up for me, head to bed.

4934
04:07:26,460 --> 04:07:27,920
Cause you deserve it.

4935
04:07:28,020 --> 04:07:29,960
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

4936
04:07:30,480 --> 04:07:31,680
Bye guys.

4937
04:07:32,180 --> 04:07:34,000
What a fucking wild game.

4938
04:07:35,940 --> 04:07:40,520
I swear the other Dynasty Warriors are like...

4939
04:07:40,520 --> 04:07:42,280
Never gone to that level before.

4940
04:07:42,540 --> 04:07:45,760
Whoever wrote the English translations...

4941
04:07:45,760 --> 04:07:47,480
Know exactly what they're doing.

4942
04:07:47,540 --> 04:07:50,860
Because I've never seen Dynasty Warriors...

4943
04:07:50,860 --> 04:07:51,460
Get...

4944
04:07:51,460 --> 04:07:52,920
The bromance...

4945
04:07:52,920 --> 04:07:53,940
Get this...

4946
04:07:53,940 --> 04:07:54,480
Like...

4947
04:07:54,480 --> 04:07:55,020
Intense.

4948
04:07:57,880 --> 04:07:58,340
Alright.

4949
04:08:00,140 --> 04:08:01,100
Bye everybody.

4950
04:08:01,820 --> 04:08:02,380
Bye.
