1
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,060
Oh shit, my car is still here, sorry.

2
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,520
Give me a sec, I'm driving over to Marvel Rivals right now.

3
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,580
Just heading over to Marvel Rivals.

4
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:15,260
Don't worry, just parking my car over to Marvel Rivals, everyone.

5
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,280
Wow, here we are.

6
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,640
I'm at my stop, let me get out of my car.

7
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,860
Let me just get out of my car.

8
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,540
Wow, here I am.

9
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,360
The Tokimobile is real.

10
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,940
Alright, sorry, I gotta park my car.

11
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,500
But we're here.

12
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,920
We made it to our destination.

13
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,880
Back at it again at Marvel.

14
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:47,460
And that's how you improv, guys.

15
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,780
That's when you know that I am a professional.

16
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,360
Give me a sec, let me make sure.

17
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,380
I think I forgot to do something.

18
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,420
I'm like, oh yeah, I forgot to change my audio.

19
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,280
Okay, this should be right.

20
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,300
Alright, so today we're gonna be practicing for Twitch Rivals.

21
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:14,340
Because if you guys didn't know, on Saturday, I will be participating.

22
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:18,760
I'm a captain for the Marvel Rivals Twitch Rivals, which is a tournament.

23
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,900
I know I keep saying it a lot.

24
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,340
I feel like I've said this like 20 times already.

25
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,620
Since I revealed it last week.

26
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,680
But I'm gonna be practicing today.

27
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,600
I feel like I haven't played yet.

28
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:38,460
Okay, that's a lie, because I played on an alt account with Valkyrie, Shoto, SK, Foolish, and them.

29
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,460
Because they asked me to join them on an alt account, so I did play a little bit.

30
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,680
But I didn't, but I can't say it.

31
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:49,420
I didn't play on my main for at least a day and a half.

32
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,280
And it's crazy.

33
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:55,760
I dropped from top 30 to like 200 within a day and a half.

34
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,740
People grind so fucking much, guys.

35
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,180
Like, in a day and a half, I literally dropped 100 plus ranks.

36
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,100
Like, I'm right here.

37
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,820
I just, I didn't play for a day and a half.

38
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,340
And I dropped 100 plus rating.

39
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,420
It's crazy.

40
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,940
People grind this game so fucking much, guys.

41
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,100
Oh my god.

42
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,580
Yeah, rest in peace me, Rip Bozo.

43
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,580
Alright.

44
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,580
Okay.

45
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,980
Uh, who does it?

46
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,040
Uh, no.

47
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,360
You invite me because I'm lazy.

48
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,460
I don't like being party leader.

49
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,520
I like to be invited.

50
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,040
I like to be a guest.

51
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,200
I don't like to be the leader here, even though I'm captain for my Twitch Rivals team.

52
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,620
To be fair, I delegated it multiple... I am not playing.

53
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,920
I refuse to play... Okay, there you go.

54
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,140
I was gonna be like, I refuse to play EU.

55
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,160
Guys, I don't... It's just not fair.

56
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,640
I play on one ping, guys.

57
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,720
It's just not fair.

58
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,460
I just think that like, I just want matches to be fair.

59
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,300
And like, you know, I don't wanna play... I don't know.

60
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,000
Just one ping is just not fair to people.

61
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,680
It's just not fair.

62
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,140
But yes, I won't be doing a super long stream today.

63
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,780
Because like, I'm tired.

64
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,980
I don't wanna drink GamerSups right now.

65
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:40,120
I really do not wanna drink GamerSups at the moment.

66
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,760
So I will not be doing a super long stream today.

67
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,440
So I'm just gonna be... I'm gonna be chilling a little bit.

68
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,480
Oh my gosh, that's not the right one.

69
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,960
Oh my gosh, where's the other image?

70
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,960
Where's the... Where's my overlay image?

71
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,640
I'm supposed to have two pictures.

72
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,760
Where's the other one?

73
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,200
Did I fuck it up?

74
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,360
Oh, no.

75
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,360
No, I did not.

76
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,040
No, no way.

77
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,360
Okay, maybe like this.

78
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,860
Is that the right one?

79
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,240
I know I have one that's... No, that's not the right...

80
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,540
What happened to my other picture?

81
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:11,920
I had two.

82
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,840
Where's the second picture?

83
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,240
Oh, wait.

84
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,480
Okay, sorry, guys.

85
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,240
I'm a little special today.

86
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,700
Oh, where's the other picture?

87
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,060
Where did it go?

88
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,720
Wait a minute.

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,860
Where is it?

90
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,820
Oh, my other picture is gone and I don't know what to do.

91
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,620
Where did it go?

92
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,120
I had two pictures.

93
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,440
I had two... Oh, fuck it.

94
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,460
I don't want to deal with you.

95
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,200
I feel like I fucked up the overlay.

96
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,120
I must have.

97
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:42,780
Oh my gosh.

98
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,580
Knowing me, I definitely fucked up the overlay.

99
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,580
Did I delete it?

100
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,720
Oh, I must have accidentally... I had to do it again?

101
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:55,380
Oh, I have to do more work.

102
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,960
I have to do above... I have to do more than the bare minimum.

103
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,700
God damn it.

104
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,800
Oh, it's so sad, guys.

105
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,180
A streamer that has to do more than the bare minimum.

106
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,120
That's the saddest thing I've ever heard today.

107
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:20,380
But yes, anyway, I'm not drinking gamer subs today because I need to chill.

108
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:30,380
I feel like lately, my body has been like...

109
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,540
Oh, you're going to play Marvel Rivals?

110
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,560
It's time to chug down some gamer subs.

111
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,680
I need to stop doing that because it's like...

112
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:43,220
I used to not drink caffeine, but ever since Marvel Rivals, I'm not sure yet.

113
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:48,340
I've talked about it earlier on stream, but I need more trial runs.

114
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,140
I need a bigger sample pool to figure this out, the scientific method and everything.

115
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:59,080
I'm trying to make sure I don't do that all the time so I'm not tired.

116
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,380
Every time before Marvel Rivals, I'm like, oh, I'm so tired.

117
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,220
I'm so tired.

118
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:11,420
The only way to fix it is if I drink gamer subs.

119
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:15,780
So now my body is like, oh, you're so tired.

120
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,320
It's Marvel Rivals time?

121
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:21,280
Oh, man, you're so tired, Doki.

122
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,200
But I'm like, am I really tired or is my body just going through withdrawals right now?

123
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,300
Because they're like, this is the only way.

124
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,500
This is the only way she'll drink gamer subs if she plays.

125
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:36,240
So we gotta make her tired so she drinks that gamer juice.

126
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,020
I'm like, no, Doki, you gotta stop doing that.

127
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,160
You gotta be strong.

128
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,300
So that's why today's not going to be a super long stream.

129
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:56,600
I'm going to stream not that long today and I might chill a little bit, talk to you guys a little bit after post-stream and that's really it.

130
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,740
Also, I don't really know if I actually have drops.

131
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,640
I might have just lied on my stream.

132
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,300
People who are like, oh my god, drops?

133
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,040
I don't know.

134
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,140
I never actually checked.

135
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,520
I just put it on my title because I see...

136
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,720
Oh, I do thank god because I never checked.

137
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,380
I was like, I don't know if I do have drops.

138
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:16,920
No!

139
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,200
Oh no, I spilled a bit of my coffee.

140
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,160
I'm going to wipe that up real quick.

141
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,660
I trust my team to do bad.

142
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,260
I did drink coffee earlier today because I was very tired.

143
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:36,500
I drank coffee today because I was like, let's see if my body is okay.

144
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,080
Because I was like, you know, coffee might not be as bad.

145
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,180
I was like, let's see if my body is okay by not drinking.

146
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:46,980
Who's talking?

147
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,900
I don't know.

148
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,360
Good question.

149
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,880
I don't know.

150
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,220
Also, I haven't warmed up at all.

151
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,360
This is literally my first game, so we'll see how this goes.

152
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,820
Am I streaming like 2-3 hours today?

153
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,180
Because I did have a very long stream already trying to fucking make a car.

154
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,940
I don't know how Finland is one of the happiest countries in the world.

155
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,820
After today, I don't understand.

156
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,100
Or like, unless they're like, they've always been like, unhappy.

157
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,700
Unless like, no, they've been trained.

158
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:39,040
They've been happy, too happy that they made something to make them unhappy.

159
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,200
Because they're like, I don't know how it feels to be unhappy.

160
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,920
Let me make this game to see what real pain is like.

161
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,240
Like, this is what I expected from Germany.

162
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,800
Like, the simulator games, this is what I expected from Germany.

163
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,460
I didn't expect this type of game from the Finns.

164
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,300
Alright, here we go.

165
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:05,560
Let's go.

166
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,240
I have not warmed up at all, so like, we'll see how it goes.

167
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,800
And yesterday, I mostly played DPS yesterday, so like, I don't feel so...

168
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,660
If I don't play after a day, I feel rusty.

169
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:29,540
And also, I have a million excuses, so if I do bad, I'm giving you guys a million excuses so you guys can go in with zero expectations.

170
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,060
Because you'll be like, oh yeah, she did tell us this and that and this and that.

171
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,900
Like, and this and that.

172
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:42,040
So maybe she's just, you know, she's not warmed up in all that stuff, you know?

173
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,460
And I'm like, yeah, that's definitely it.

174
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,080
I'm like, scared playing here.

175
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,260
I'm gonna fucking get down.

176
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,520
Oh my god, I can't get out!

177
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,140
Goodbye!

178
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:56,760
Stop!

179
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,780
Oh my god, I feel so rusty.

180
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,780
I do feel really rusty right now.

181
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,940
Yeah, I feel incredibly rusty at the moment.

182
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,560
Oh my god.

183
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,620
She's gonna be... oh no, she's alive.

184
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,980
Nope, she's alive.

185
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,480
You're still alive.

186
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,440
You're so healthy.

187
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,400
It's alright.

188
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,340
It's okay.

189
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:19,820
What's he gonna do?

190
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,800
Shoot me through that?

191
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,580
No, he is trying to shoot...

192
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,860
Oh my god!

193
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,060
What the fuck?

194
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,540
Where's my team?

195
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,460
Why is it just me and my...

196
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,700
Oh my god.

197
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,740
Oh, we went to their spawn.

198
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,700
Did we go to their spawn?

199
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,900
Oh, we went to... why the fuck?

200
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,080
I should not have followed my cloak.

201
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,820
I should not have followed my cloak.

202
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,900
Oh my god, following my cloak was actually the worst decision of my life.

203
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,160
Is that bubble reaching you?

204
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,860
Alright, I'm a little scared.

205
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,700
Just a little bit.

206
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,920
It's okay, I can deal with one loss.

207
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,040
I'm a little scared though.

208
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,940
It's okay, I can... one loss is fine.

209
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,180
And then maybe two losses is fine too, you know?

210
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,340
Maybe two losses is fine too.

211
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,500
And maybe three losses is fine too.

212
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,560
I can regain it back off stream.

213
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,700
Okay, not gonna lie.

214
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:27,740
I don't trust gaining RP and gaining rank points anymore on stream.

215
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:34,040
Knowing that I'm getting... knowing that two million people want me fucking dead.

216
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:41,640
Like... I legitimately... I legitimately... I don't believe it.

217
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,000
I don't believe it anymore.

218
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,360
Okay.

219
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,100
Okay, I'm dead.

220
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,900
I'm dead.

221
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,780
I don't think the Lay is fun.

222
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,280
I don't find the Lay very fun.

223
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:07,780
I feel like I rather just deal with the stream sniping and then climb off stream if I have to.

224
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,900
But like, I don't care too much anymore.

225
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,920
So like, I've accepted it.

226
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:19,480
I've accepted my life as the... It's so weird.

227
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:23,380
I've never had that experience before, being stream sniped.

228
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,700
Because, you know, I'm not well known on Twitch.

229
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,580
And I usually don't stream on Twitch too.

230
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,960
Because I don't get stream sniped on YouTube.

231
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,460
So I'm not used to this at all.

232
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:46,620
It's okay.

233
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,560
We're still healthy.

234
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,760
We're still healthy.

235
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,240
We're still healthy.

236
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,860
What's up?

237
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,060
Oh my god.

238
00:14:59,240 --> 00:14:59,760
Oh my god.

239
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,440
I am healing you.

240
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,440
I am healing you.

241
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm panicking, but I still healed you.

242
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,620
That's called a gamer move right there.

243
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,660
I might be panicking, but you're still getting healed.

244
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,940
Remember what I did.

245
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,980
Just remember, I have absolutely so much fear, but I still did it.

246
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,480
Alright, nice.

247
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,620
Oh yeah, there is streamer mode.

248
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,040
You're right.

249
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,040
I could put it on stream.

250
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:35,440
Yeah, but I feel like streamer mode doesn't matter when people just literally open up, like, my stream.

251
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,520
People who are like...

252
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,040
Purposely queue snipe me.

253
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:45,780
Because I know some people... Apparently, I have a target on my back.

254
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,940
I'm like, I'm so irrelevant.

255
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:54,020
I'm like, how do I have a target on my back?

256
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,800
Sometimes people queue snipe me.

257
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm like, what?

258
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,180
Because they're like, she's Freelo.

259
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,020
Get her.

260
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,240
And I'm like, please.

261
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,020
Oh my god, please.

262
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,340
Please, I had to make a car today.

263
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,740
Please have mercy.

264
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,640
I had to fucking try to make a car.

265
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,160
This is my... Please have mercy.

266
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,340
Please have mercy.

267
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:29,000
Oh my god, the Pantyhunter has the Freelo.

268
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:33,120
Yeah, but it's more so like players who play this game every fucking day.

269
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,880
And then I have to do... Oh my gosh.

270
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,780
I have like a tech on rehearsals too.

271
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,180
I feel weird.

272
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,560
I don't even feel comfortable being back here, not gonna lie.

273
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,340
Like, no, no, no.

274
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,760
Oh, you got all.

275
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:51,700
Sorry.

276
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,480
That's fine.

277
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,120
They don't... That's fine.

278
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,400
It's fine, guys.

279
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,220
That's fine.

280
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,820
We don't... It's alright.

281
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:10,300
I'm so confident that we won that like I shouldn't have done it.

282
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,160
I was just...

283
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,080
Guys, I was so confident that we're gonna win this game.

284
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:20,340
I wanted the enemy team to like have a slight advantage because I feel so bad.

285
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,120
I'm gonna say this.

286
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:21,900
I'm gonna win this round.

287
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,540
I'm pretty sure.

288
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,980
And then we have to play a third round and we lose this game because of me.

289
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,540
But like, obviously, it's not because of me.

290
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:33,220
It's because my team didn't communicate better.

291
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,740
So like, how can it be my fault?

292
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,800
How can it be my fault?

293
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,740
Guys, my team should have communicated better.

294
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,100
How can it be my fault?

295
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,520
Why did my team not communicate better?

296
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:00,360
Guys, you're never... Exactly.

297
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,140
Never the support's fault.

298
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:08,600
Also, I didn't think... I didn't think the cloak was gonna... I think I would have died in the cloak if I didn't ult that too.

299
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,600
So I was playing KDA.

300
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,700
Never... Exactly.

301
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,780
Never take accountability.

302
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,700
As a support player, you never have to take accountability.

303
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,460
Exactly.

304
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,840
I'm gonna make sure our fucking Strange doesn't die.

305
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,040
I don't know what our Strange is doing.

306
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,220
I just don't want him to die.

307
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,380
I don't... Let's just... Let's just make sure he doesn't die.

308
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,060
He's just slowly... Very slowly, he's just walking over.

309
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,720
There we go.

310
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,300
Alright, okay.

311
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,660
Okay.

312
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,440
Okay.

313
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:48,580
Okay.

314
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,320
I mean, you do you.

315
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,360
That's fine.

316
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,020
Alright, this is a good warm-up game.

317
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,560
I don't know what I'm doing.

318
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,860
I don't think they expected me to... Oh my god, please, I fell down.

319
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,480
Someone help me.

320
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,840
I've fallen and I can't get up.

321
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,460
I'm playing the feller.

322
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,500
I've fallen and I can't get up.

323
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,220
What?

324
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,500
Okay, that's not my fault.

325
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,020
I healed you.

326
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:16,980
You all saw it.

327
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:17,820
Put the video.

328
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,360
I healed him through everything, so if he blames me, that's his own fault.

329
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,840
I did my job.

330
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,980
I literally... All I did was stay there.

331
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,680
Alright, nice.

332
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,420
That's huge.

333
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,960
Strange, get over here!

334
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,220
Okay, nice.

335
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,500
Alright, that's all that matters.

336
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,500
Alright, don't worry.

337
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:44,980
I'm here.

338
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,400
Wait, is my Strange?

339
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,140
Don't worry, Strange.

340
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,120
I'm also here.

341
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,000
Nice.

342
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,000
And he's gonna...

343
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,700
I knew it!

344
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,540
I freaking knew it!

345
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,610
Oh my god, what?

346
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,570
I am alive?

347
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,510
Alright, that's fine.

348
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:02,790
I am alive?

349
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:04,270
I mean, that's fine.

350
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:05,590
I'll take this.

351
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,030
I'll stay here though.

352
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,230
They won't know I'm here.

353
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,270
They'll never expect this.

354
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,970
They'll never expect it.

355
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,810
I'm just hiding in this corner.

356
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:18,810
This little Luna rat.

357
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:19,970
Where am I?

358
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:20,770
They don't know.

359
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:23,810
They don't know.

360
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:24,590
Where am I?

361
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:26,810
Alright, there you go.

362
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:27,090
See?

363
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,490
That was very clear.

364
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:34,310
I knew he was gonna ult there, but I had to be there to keep people alive.

365
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,110
We did it!

366
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,510
Thank you for the Twitch prom!

367
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:42,710
Thank you, thank you!

368
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,270
There you go.

369
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:46,830
One tricks have got to be banned.

370
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:48,730
Which one is it?

371
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,330
So I know it.

372
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:50,170
Oh, wait.

373
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:50,930
Which one is it?

374
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:52,350
Basics?

375
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,510
Spiderman one trick?

376
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:54,630
Where is he?

377
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,350
Yeah, this guy?

378
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:57,850
Damn.

379
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,810
I don't know how you can one trick in higher elo.

380
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:06,170
Like, how do you get away with that?

381
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,550
Like, especially when bans are a thing.

382
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,110
Yeah, I got him.

383
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:15,530
I wonder how.

384
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:17,670
Legitimately, I don't understand.

385
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,390
How long did you one trick, Luna?

386
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,290
Guys, I was never a one trick.

387
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,990
I could always play other supports.

388
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:26,070
It's just that Luna was the best character.

389
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:31,870
You can't say Spiderman is the best DPS character in this game.

390
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:40,730
Spiderman is so fucking situational, but Luna is always the best character in any matchup.

391
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:41,890
Except now.

392
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:46,030
Now, Cloak is the best, but she's still A tier.

393
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:49,250
If you have Cloak, I can still play Luna.

394
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:56,750
Yeah, but my highest win rate was actually Adam, though.

395
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:02,550
Lord, thank you for gifting a sub to Akemi.

396
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:03,630
Thank you, thank you.

397
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,450
I really appreciate it.

398
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:07,370
True somehow.

399
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:13,690
Yeah, actually, my highest win rate was actually Adam.

400
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:18,050
It was like 70%, I think.

401
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:21,690
High 70s, almost 80%.

402
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:27,650
So, I was a Luna one trick for a little bit.

403
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:28,770
For just a little bit.

404
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:32,010
Like 1% of my career in Marble Rivals.

405
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,870
And then I learned other characters, okay?

406
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:41,250
How you had almost... I don't know.

407
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:41,990
I don't know.

408
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:45,010
I feel like Adam, I just unlocked my fourth eye.

409
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:50,950
Cloak and Dagger, I finally unlocked my third eye, but Adam, I unlocked the fourth eye.

410
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:56,010
There's just something in him that I just... I literally became Adam.

411
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:10,550
Oh yeah, speaking of Adam, I was looking at skins and stuff, and one of my friends was saying how...

412
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:13,010
Because I was talking about Marble Rivals skins.

413
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:15,070
I'll never buy Marble Rivals skins until I get sponsored.

414
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,710
That's my goal.

415
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:24,610
If I ever get sponsored by Marble Rivals, I will buy a skin.

416
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,850
I will buy a skin.

417
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:36,810
But I was talking about some of the Marble Rivals skins, and we were judging the skins that they have.

418
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:45,910
And one of my friends was like, oh yeah, the Guardians of the Galaxy skin for Adam is so ugly.

419
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:47,930
Because it doesn't look like him.

420
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,250
I'm like, what do you mean?

421
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:51,430
It looks exactly like the actor.

422
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:55,010
Except for the face a little bit.

423
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:57,250
And they were like, exactly!

424
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,190
The face doesn't look like it.

425
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,270
And I'm like, of course!

426
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:07,710
Do you know how much money you have to pay to buy the actor's face?

427
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:08,850
Like,

428
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:12,910
oh my god.

429
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:19,630
Like, they have to pay like 10 plus A-list actors for their face.

430
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,570
Like, to copyright their face.

431
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:25,710
And yeah, the royalties would be fucking insane.

432
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:27,310
That's why they don't look like them.

433
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:29,710
Because their faces are copyrighted.

434
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:53,150
That's why some toys, if you look at toys or shows or various media, the reason why they don't look like the actors or the actresses is that you have to pay a special royalty to use their face for things.

435
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:57,430
So, obviously, this game is not gonna do that.

436
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:04,930
That's why when you hear the voices, they sort of sound like them, but not.

437
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:09,770
So it's like, you know, a copyright-free version.

438
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:18,630
So it's like, basically, they're like, oh, it sort of sounds like Tom Hiddleston's Loki, but there's just something a little off.

439
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:27,170
And so it's like, legally distinct, so the actors won't be like, wait a minute, you're stealing my voice.

440
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,910
They can't claim royalties off of it.

441
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:42,570
It just, it sort of sounds like them, but just a little bit different.

442
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,070
Yeah, they did do a great job.

443
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:53,570
Because, like, anybody can do a full impersonation of, like, some of the more famous actors and actresses.

444
00:25:55,670 --> 00:26:02,530
But, like, because it's very, I won't say it's very easy, but it's, like, it's very common to do, like, impersonations.

445
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:09,530
Like, because, you know, like, Woody from Toy Story, for his voice acting, if it's not the movies, oh gosh, it's baby.

446
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:14,730
If it's not the movies, I hope he's not as toxic today.

447
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,330
I hope today he had a good day.

448
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:23,110
I hope he had a good day today.

449
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:38,890
Anyway, so, like, Woody in Toy Story, so y'all know Tom Hanks voices Woody in Toy Story, but only in the movies.

450
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:40,930
Only in the movies.

451
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:50,090
So everything else he's, every, all the other, like, media that Woody is in is actually voiced by his little brother.

452
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:55,050
So, like, it's not even voiced by Tom Hanks, it's done by his little brother.

453
00:26:55,490 --> 00:27:03,230
So, because they're like, we don't want to pay Tom Hanks, but his little brother would do it for less money.

454
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:12,910
And obviously Tom Hanks is going to be like, how dare you, Jim?

455
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:19,830
Because he's rich as fuck, so, like, it's not like, and it's like, oh yeah, my little brother gets to be paid, you know?

456
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:27,590
So he's not going to be like, what the fuck you doing, Jim?

457
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:33,210
He's going to be like, well, little bro's trying to get the bag, you know what, let little bro get the bag.

458
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:38,770
We have Woody's younger brother.

459
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:45,970
Yeah, the money still stays in the family, at least.

460
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:49,790
Oh my god, I will fucking eat you.

461
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,130
I'm sorry.

462
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:02,950
I will ban the word raccoon in my chat, I fucking swear.

463
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:07,010
I will ban him.

464
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:11,490
Do it.

465
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:19,430
You know what, no, you know what, fuck you guys, I'm banning, no, I am promoting censorship of Rocket Raccoon.

466
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:26,490
That's right, I'm going into a dictatorship now.

467
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:30,370
That's fucking right, I'm banning Rocket Raccoon.

468
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:33,690
I am censoring Rocket Raccoon.

469
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:36,070
Poor Rude and Kai.

470
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,290
Oh, they banned Luna?

471
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,310
Oh, I guess it's Cloak and Dagger time.

472
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,110
Give me a sec.

473
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:48,810
Say your last Rocket Raccoons before it's gone forever.

474
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:50,470
Alright, where is it?

475
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:51,830
I need to remember how to ban stuff.

476
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,350
Give me a sec, guys.

477
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,470
It's been a while since I whitelisted.

478
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:59,530
Okay, block terms and phrases.

479
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,250
Rocket Raccoon.

480
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:03,050
There we go.

481
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:03,970
And Raccoon.

482
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:12,650
That's right, it's over for you Raccoon worshippers.

483
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:16,850
It's fucking over.

484
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:17,650
No!

485
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:27,010
Rocket Raccoon, we can never talk about him again.

486
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,450
That's fucking right.

487
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:29,950
You go straight to jail.

488
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:32,650
Give us freedom.

489
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:37,810
Straight to jail if I see that rodent in my chat.

490
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:41,070
Oh my god, already?

491
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:45,150
It's working already.

492
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:49,590
Crystal Raccoon, wait till you get back.

493
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:54,270
That's right.

494
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:57,750
What's stopping me from banning it in YouTube too?

495
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,350
That's fucking right.

496
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:03,290
What's gonna stop me?

497
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:05,730
What kind of portal is that?

498
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:08,610
That's a terrible portal.

499
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:11,970
Everything will be fine.

500
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,690
It's gonna be a-okay.

501
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:16,330
It's gonna be a-okay.

502
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:17,850
See?

503
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,310
Everything will be fine.

504
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:20,850
I feel so healthy.

505
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:21,290
You know what?

506
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:22,610
I feel so healthy.

507
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:23,870
I'm going straight in.

508
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:24,570
That's fucking right.

509
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:25,630
I'm going straight in.

510
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:28,470
I ain't afraid-oh wait, I'm a little afraid.

511
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,470
I ain't afraid of you.

512
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,090
There we go.

513
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:33,190
That's fine.

514
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,410
That sucked.

515
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:38,370
I hesitated a little bit, but now I'm confident.

516
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:39,950
I'm so confident.

517
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:42,670
I'm going crazy.

518
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:44,110
Oh yeah?

519
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:45,590
Can I ban Nemo's?

520
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:46,110
Wait, guys.

521
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:52,930
You think using pictures can save your precious raccoon?

522
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,490
That's right.

523
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:57,670
I'm gonna burn the emote too.

524
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:01,610
No longer are they allowed in this chat.

525
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:05,230
I'll never allow them ever again.

526
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:08,190
What the fuck?

527
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:14,410
That's right.

528
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,330
This is an anti-raccoon.

529
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:17,490
You know what?

530
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:17,990
Fuck it.

531
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,290
You guys don't get this.

532
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:21,490
You think you're gonna get this ult?

533
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:23,070
It's our ult now.

534
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:25,010
Oh shit.

535
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:26,690
Okay, I did not expect to disappear there.

536
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,090
Oh shit.

537
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,110
Oh fuck.

538
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:31,590
Oh, I don't know where the Magneto ult is.

539
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:36,750
I actually don't know where the Magneto ult is.

540
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:38,430
I got a scare.

541
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:41,530
Legend.

542
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:43,910
Alright.

543
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,650
Thank you for the raid.

544
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:47,050
Thank you.

545
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:47,910
Thank you.

546
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:50,650
For those who are near here, my name is Jokeybird.

547
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:54,730
And we are a very tolerant and inclusive community.

548
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:02,390
Of every bipedal creature.

549
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:04,810
True.

550
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:11,810
Don't say that.

551
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:15,310
Wait, that makes me sound so bad.

552
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:19,470
Guys, guys, guys, that actually makes me sound fucking terrible.

553
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:21,090
Wait a minute.

554
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:25,370
Guys, guys, don't listen to them.

555
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:28,430
The only thing that's like...

556
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:31,930
They're just raccoon sympathizers.

557
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,210
Don't listen to them.

558
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:42,270
I'm surprised like... I have zero deaths with this shit I'm saying.

559
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:45,270
I'm like literally autopiloting right now.

560
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:46,790
Oh my god.

561
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,690
This is a GM lobby?

562
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:54,690
Let's get out.

563
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:57,250
Let's be aggressive for once.

564
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:01,610
Oh, I'm fucking gonna suck.

565
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:02,650
That's right.

566
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:06,510
This is my... Oh, wait.

567
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:07,250
I'm a little scared.

568
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:07,770
Never mind.

569
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:09,250
I am a little scared now.

570
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,330
Oh, shit.

571
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:12,290
Oh, shit.

572
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,450
Oh, I'm 1 HP.

573
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:16,570
They don't know.

574
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:19,270
They don't know.

575
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:21,330
They don't know.

576
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:22,990
Everything will be okay.

577
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:24,810
I'll heal myself if I have to.

578
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,230
I'll heal myself.

579
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:28,850
You're so healthy!

580
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:31,310
We did it.

581
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:34,330
You're gonna what now?

582
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:37,190
Alright, free the raccoons.

583
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:44,610
Oh, thanks for giving me like the alternative spellings of raccoons, guys.

584
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,790
More names to add to my fucking list.

585
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,790
Okay, this is where I died though.

586
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:51,830
This is actually where I died.

587
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,490
Oh, no.

588
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,490
My zero deaths.

589
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,670
It was so perfect.

590
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,210
It was so perfect.

591
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,490
Oh, my god.

592
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,970
We were almost there.

593
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:09,270
We were almost there.

594
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:14,050
That's why I'll add every single alternative spelling of Rocky Raccoon.

595
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:17,030
You think you can bypass the censorship?

596
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:18,770
You really think?

597
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:25,310
Rocky Raccoon is my favorite healer.

598
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:28,850
You really think you can bypass this?

599
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,590
That's fucking right.

600
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:37,730
That's right!

601
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:38,710
I'm a gamer!

602
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,890
I told you!

603
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:46,730
I've unlocked a third eye in this.

604
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:47,490
I told you.

605
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,010
There's literally a third eye.

606
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:52,470
It's actually crazy.

607
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:55,270
I figured out how to play this fucking dagger.

608
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:59,190
There you go.

609
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,110
I figured it out.

610
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:03,410
I locked in my Psylocke, but that's okay.

611
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:04,570
We don't need him for now.

612
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:05,530
See?

613
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:06,390
He can dash.

614
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,550
It's not locking him in if he can dash.

615
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:10,910
Okay.

616
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:12,410
Alright.

617
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:13,210
Nice.

618
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:18,890
No, Adam is my fourth eye.

619
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:22,190
Cloak and dagger is my third eye.

620
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:26,550
There's no way our Rocket is carrying.

621
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:28,230
Like, what is he doing?

622
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:33,110
What has he done?

623
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:33,870
There's no way.

624
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:35,130
I refuse to believe.

625
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:39,710
Alright.

626
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,110
Alright.

627
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:40,710
Let me see.

628
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:41,030
Okay.

629
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:42,650
Let's get rid of this emote.

630
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:45,150
Let's get rid of Rack Attack right now.

631
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:48,950
You know what?

632
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:49,110
No.

633
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:49,790
You know what?

634
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:51,710
I'm a good person.

635
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,550
I'll let you guys keep Rack Attack.

636
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:54,730
You know what?

637
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:58,550
I'll let you guys keep Rack Attack, but let me get all the other ones.

638
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,830
Let me guess.

639
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:01,510
Okay.

640
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:06,590
There's a Rodrick Raccoon.

641
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:11,610
There's Rack and Rock on Pocket Pacoon.

642
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:14,750
Rock and Raccoon.

643
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,530
Wack Wacoon.

644
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:18,590
Socket Pacoon.

645
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:22,130
Okay.

646
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:22,990
Okay.

647
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,250
I give you guys that.

648
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:26,510
You guys are very creative.

649
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:32,790
Okay.

650
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,350
She's scared.

651
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:35,330
Quick.

652
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:36,930
She's scared.

653
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:42,330
10 plus Socket, Wack and Raccoon.

654
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:50,510
It's like Bendy Cabbage Patch all over again.

655
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,790
We created the newest Bendy Cabbage Patch.

656
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,150
Oh no.

657
00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:02,670
I wanna say triple support is so cringe and boring, but like, who cares?

658
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:03,210
I'm winning.

659
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:07,850
That's the opinion of people who try too hard.

660
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,550
All I care about is winning.

661
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:13,910
I don't care about that triple support is cringe and boring.

662
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:19,170
I'm gonna win with triple support if I have- Whoa shit.

663
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:19,550
Okay.

664
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:22,350
I float over here now.

665
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:25,350
This is my new home.

666
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:26,890
Okay.

667
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,930
Let me get over here though.

668
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:30,270
Okay.

669
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:31,270
Let's go over here.

670
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:36,310
People who say triple support is boring don't wanna win.

671
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,470
They're the boring ones.

672
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:43,170
You want unique comps with more exciting gameplay?

673
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:44,350
What are you?

674
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:45,550
Don't you wanna win?

675
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,150
Are you a loser?

676
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:51,910
Don't you wanna win?

677
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:55,710
You know what?

678
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:56,930
Give me four supports.

679
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,890
Make the sports even stronger.

680
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:02,390
Get Professor Xavier here so we can have four supports.

681
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:07,130
What fun?

682
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:09,510
Isn't winning fun enough?

683
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:13,310
You want more than that?

684
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:17,090
Or are you depressed?

685
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:19,790
Winning should be enough fun for you.

686
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,750
Oh shit.

687
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,530
He's dead though.

688
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:29,550
He's so dead.

689
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:33,530
I was not focused on anything here.

690
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:35,010
Alright.

691
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:38,030
What?!

692
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,030
No, I got ulted!

693
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:39,790
Wait, do I still have my ult?

694
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:40,350
No!

695
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:44,250
I got fucking strange ult.

696
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:45,690
It was gonna be so cool.

697
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:49,670
I got strange ulted in the middle of that so I lost my ult.

698
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:58,190
I got strange and armed and dangerous at the same time.

699
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:02,250
Gosha, thank you for the hundred bitties.

700
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:03,050
Thank you, thank you.

701
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:04,790
We're Raccoon City now.

702
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:05,670
Rack attack.

703
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:09,550
That's fine.

704
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:11,090
I'm okay with it.

705
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,650
Alright, I got you.

706
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:15,450
I'll give this to them.

707
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:18,530
Oh, that's unfortunate.

708
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:27,210
That's very unfortunate for this guy.

709
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,350
That's fine.

710
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:30,670
Everything is fine.

711
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:35,190
Look, Snoopy is one of the good ones though.

712
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:36,810
Like, that doesn't count.

713
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:38,890
Like, she's my exception.

714
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,370
But like, Rocket Raccoon.

715
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:45,770
Rocket Raccoon.

716
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,670
He is not one of the good ones.

717
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:51,790
He is definitely not one of the good ones.

718
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:57,790
Snoopy lives another day.

719
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:03,950
Like, I'm... oh shit, I'm fucking goodbye.

720
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:05,810
Goodbye.

721
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:08,930
My dad... oh, no, he knows.

722
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,490
He knows I don't.

723
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:12,650
Holy shit, who did he chuck that to?

724
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:13,350
Who?

725
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:14,390
Oh no.

726
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:17,370
I'm a little nervous here.

727
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:21,450
I'm a little nervous here.

728
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:24,150
So like, do you think they know?

729
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:25,850
Do you think they know I'm right here?

730
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:27,190
I don't think he does.

731
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:28,790
Oh no.

732
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:31,010
Okay, I can't do anything.

733
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:33,890
Please let me float.

734
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:34,570
Please!

735
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:34,730
Please!

736
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:42,410
Let me float away.

737
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,270
No!

738
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,090
Clueless Magneto.

739
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:51,150
Alright, I need the speed boost here.

740
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:55,070
Alright, could have lived as Raccoon.

741
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:56,530
You know what's funny?

742
00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:00,730
He has the highest win rate so far in the supports.

743
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:03,070
But it's like, you don't understand.

744
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:07,770
Apparently in low ELO, everybody plays Rocket Raccoon in low ELO.

745
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:09,650
It's actually crazy from what I've heard.

746
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:12,910
Oh my god!

747
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:17,270
And he's harder to aim at.

748
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:27,730
If you play low ELO with Rocket Raccoon, because he has so much movement abilities, he's harder to kill in lower ELO because of his movement and stuff.

749
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:32,910
Yes, because he's harder to shoot at.

750
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:37,820
But in higher ELO, you have to have a third support or a really good punisher.

751
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:54,360
So like, it's just like, people rather play Cloak and Dagger, Invisible Woman, or Luna instead of Rocket Raccoon or put Rocket Raccoon as a third support.

752
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,000
Only because- oh my god.

753
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,360
Only because like...

754
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:02,400
Ahaha!

755
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:11,510
He has opened!

756
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:14,710
Fears and I!

757
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:16,770
That's right!

758
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:20,210
I told you, I don't fear no more.

759
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:24,370
I have learned what fear is.

760
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:26,170
I should ult, I have not ulted.

761
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:29,850
I usually use my ult as a counter cloak.

762
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:31,650
If they cloak up, I cloak up.

763
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:34,070
And I haven't seen a cloak ult in a while.

764
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:35,530
Maybe I'll do it here, honestly.

765
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:37,230
I won't be surprised.

766
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:41,810
I want to back up more because I feel like... Oh my god!

767
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:43,450
STRANGE GET OVER HERE!

768
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:43,830
NO!

769
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:44,990
SHE GOT PUSHED!

770
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:46,210
WHAT IS HE SUPPOSED TO DO?

771
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:48,630
HE GOT PUSHED!

772
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:50,070
HE GOT PUSHED!

773
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:52,050
OH MY GOD, HE GOT PUSHED!

774
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:56,750
ARMED AND DANGEROUS!

775
00:42:57,130 --> 00:42:57,570
OH NO!

776
00:42:58,690 --> 00:42:59,490
OH NO!

777
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:00,410
OH NO!

778
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:01,370
I'M ONE OF THEM!

779
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:03,890
I AM ONE OF THEM!

780
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:05,570
I told you.

781
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:08,210
I don't fear no more.

782
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:11,590
I don't fear no more.

783
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:11,910
I don't fear no more.

784
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:11,930
I don't fear no more.

785
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:14,310
You see, if we had a triple support...

786
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:16,770
If our triple support was Mantis...

787
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:22,250
We could have got a third defensive ult, guys.

788
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:23,370
We could have got a third defensive ult, guys.

789
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:26,810
We could have had a...

790
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:27,970
Oh, look at that!

791
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:29,630
Oh, look at that!

792
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:32,930
The Mantis got the third triple support.

793
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:36,810
Oh my... The Mantis ulted the third defensive ult!

794
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:40,670
I wish we had a third defensive ult.

795
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:42,970
Oh man!

796
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:51,170
Oh man!

797
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,430
Oh man!

798
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:54,270
Oh man!

799
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:54,310
Oh man!

800
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:55,610
Damage?

801
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:58,130
But no, that's way too silly!

802
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:01,570
That's way...

803
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:03,510
That's crazy thinking right there!

804
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:04,950
That's way...

805
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:06,710
Guys, like, why would I think that?

806
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:09,530
He's too busy!

807
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:11,810
HAHAHA!

808
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:14,610
That's actually right, bitch!

809
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:17,090
You might as well not exist!

810
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:20,290
You might as well...

811
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:21,550
That's fucking right.

812
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:22,910
You're denied twice!

813
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:24,030
Twice!

814
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:28,490
Oh my god, I'm freaking out.

815
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:29,290
I might die though.

816
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:31,710
God, I can't!

817
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,040
Oh no, 30 seconds.

818
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:35,780
Do we have another ult?

819
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,460
We have- oh, it's my ult next.

820
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:41,640
Okay, we might be able to survive with my ult if we all live.

821
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,460
Only if we all live though.

822
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:46,500
Okay, don't worry.

823
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:48,400
I can- I have ult soon.

824
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:51,880
Okay, please do not die.

825
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,540
Oh my god, I just made it.

826
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:56,860
I just made it.

827
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,920
Oh my god, I just made it.

828
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,760
I just made it.

829
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:03,360
Holy shit.

830
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:05,120
Oh my god.

831
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,060
I actually- I actually just made it.

832
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:09,300
Oh my god.

833
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,380
Oh my god.

834
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,140
No, not disappear.

835
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:13,360
Not disappear.

836
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,740
Oh my god.

837
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:15,080
Yes!

838
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,520
I just- that's fine.

839
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:20,100
I'll just keep denying him.

840
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:22,120
That's right!

841
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:30,180
No longer do I fear.

842
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,680
No longer.

843
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,280
No fear when there's a third eye.

844
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:41,880
I told you guys.

845
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:50,240
I- all I do is just keep- I keep my- Just for Magneto because I know he's- I fucking learned.

846
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:51,680
I fucking hate myself.

847
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:52,860
I fucking- oh my god.

848
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:53,540
I hate this game.

849
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:54,580
I love the Marvel Rivals.

850
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,560
I love Marvel Rivals.

851
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:05,500
I fucking- I love Marvel Rivals so much, guys.

852
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,680
It's my favorite game.

853
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,180
I'm fearless.

854
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,380
I told you.

855
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:18,200
I'm fucking- I've like downloaded the game in my head now.

856
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:19,040
It's too bad.

857
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:21,540
I won't be playing Cloak and Dagger in the tournament.

858
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,280
I'll be on- I don't know.

859
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:25,800
It depends on the comp we're gonna do.

860
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,220
I'm not sure what comp we're actually doing.

861
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:37,540
But like it really depends on what the comp is because I could technically play Cloak and Dagger because of that.

862
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,380
What the fuck do you mean?

863
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,120
I out-healed him!

864
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,400
I even out-damaged him!

865
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:48,370
What the fuck?

866
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:50,330
I- I out-healed him!

867
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:51,750
Apparently.

868
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:53,070
Oh, okay.

869
00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:54,770
Okay, apparently.

870
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:55,850
Oh, yeah.

871
00:46:56,130 --> 00:47:00,290
I literally- What other abilities does he have other than left click?

872
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:02,570
I have the fucking Cloak people.

873
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:03,730
I have the DPS.

874
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:07,750
I have the- I have the blind people.

875
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:11,150
What other things does a raccoon have other than healing?

876
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:11,850
What?

877
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:16,410
Okay.

878
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:16,870
Yeah, Doki.

879
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:20,870
Oh, but Doki, how many people did you resurrect?

880
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:26,990
Oh, yeah.

881
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:28,390
Oh, wow.

882
00:47:32,870 --> 00:47:36,730
All right, I'm so tempted to just avoid the raccoon player.

883
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:38,170
I really am.

884
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:41,790
I- I really am so tempted.

885
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:44,050
I- I don't want to play.

886
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:46,750
I don't want to play with him anymore.

887
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:49,110
I'm just a hater.

888
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:51,650
You're just a hater.

889
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:56,630
All right.

890
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:01,290
All right, I feel really good about myself.

891
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:03,650
I feel- I feel really good.

892
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:04,430
Toxic.

893
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:06,290
Avoid all the rodents.

894
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,660
All right, let's see who's on my team this time.

895
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:21,000
Okay.

896
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:30,320
I hope I didn't, like, ditch one of the- um, ditch one, uh, raccoon player for the next raccoon player.

897
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:31,700
That'd be very unfortunate.

898
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,060
I'm gonna fucking ego you.

899
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:34,720
That's right.

900
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,120
I mean, I could have- I don't- I don't feel nice today.

901
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:48,160
I don't- like, I feel nice today, but I don't feel- I don't feel- what's the word?

902
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,380
What's the word where you don't- accommodating.

903
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:54,620
I don't feel accommodating today because I actually have to practice for Twitch Rivals.

904
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,120
Um, I have a tournament.

905
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,440
What's your excuse, Monotune?

906
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,520
I have a tournament in a week.

907
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,520
Not even a week and less than a week.

908
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,080
Triple support part two.

909
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:10,780
Let's go.

910
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:11,660
What?

911
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:16,360
Okay, anyway, I can't- I guess I can't play her.

912
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:17,840
Oh, I can play Cloak and Dagger though.

913
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:21,320
It's more important.

914
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,160
All right, I guess, um...

915
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:30,870
I guess I play Cloak and Dagger then.

916
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:34,870
I don't even know if I'm gonna be playing Cloak and Dagger, but fuck it.

917
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:38,190
All right.

918
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:40,630
I hope we do okay.

919
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:42,590
I'm aiming for top four, honestly.

920
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:45,290
Um, well, it's not really target banned.

921
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:52,090
It's more so people don't like playing with and against the Luna because nothing- because the game stops for 12 seconds.

922
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:57,330
And like, DPS and tank players get really like, ADH-pilled.

923
00:49:57,570 --> 00:50:00,830
So they're like, I can't, I can't, I can't.

924
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:04,630
They're like, I need to do something.

925
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:07,630
These 12 seconds are gonna kill me.

926
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:09,270
Um, so...

927
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:12,050
So like, they just, you know, want stuff to happen.

928
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:15,570
With it not, like, have nothing happening in 12 seconds.

929
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:23,030
And Luna with Loki is really, like, frustrating because that makes it like, 24 seconds of nothing to do.

930
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:29,130
You have 20- now you would have two Luna ults and then 24 seconds of nothing.

931
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:30,530
Straight up nothing.

932
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:32,010
Nothing dying.

933
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:33,070
Nothing happening.

934
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:35,110
Is Cloak better?

935
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:37,890
Cloak is better than Mantis because Mantis feels so fucking slow now.

936
00:50:37,890 --> 00:50:39,990
I think Cloak is better than Mantis now.

937
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:41,830
Her ult has better sustainability.

938
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,360
All right.

939
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,640
Let's go.

940
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:50,040
I love her.

941
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:50,980
I love her melee.

942
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,460
I think it's really cute.

943
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,960
Like the- whoa, dual flip!

944
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:56,160
Dual flip!

945
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,080
I think my- I don't know.

946
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:06,180
I think my positioning in Cloak definitely needs to be better though.

947
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,020
My positioning is not, like, the best on her.

948
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:12,460
Like, I still- I don't know what I'm- oh my god.

949
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,300
That scared me.

950
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:19,380
That actually scared the shit out of me because I was like, what the fuck?

951
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,940
What he doing there?

952
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,900
Oh my god, did somebody die?

953
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:31,140
Oh wait, somebody did.

954
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:33,500
Oh, I'm scared.

955
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:35,740
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

956
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,020
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

957
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:38,260
No!

958
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:41,780
I'll try and use E.

959
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,400
I accidentally swapped instead.

960
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:46,080
All right, this is a little awkward.

961
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:53,200
This is- wait, why the fuck the Punisher one trick is on- oh my god, the Punisher one trick is on Widow?

962
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:55,580
We didn't ban Wolf?

963
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,740
No, we accidentally banned two Bruce Banners.

964
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:00,480
Ooh, this might be our first loss of the day.

965
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:01,840
I don't feel so good about this.

966
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:05,820
I feel like our- I don't know.

967
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,160
I think they're very- Whoa.

968
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,140
I feel they're very oppressive right now.

969
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:16,320
The DPS player is because we don't have a Raccoon.

970
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,720
I feel like they're- I don't- yeah, no, they're- they're- what the fuck?

971
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,920
I'd rather they have Punisher at this point.

972
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:26,800
Holy shit.

973
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:30,120
Wait, who needs heals?

974
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:32,300
Okay, I couldn't tell.

975
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:35,600
All right, we'll just put this in the corner.

976
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,960
I don't know if I want to peek because of their Widow.

977
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:39,820
Their Widow's a little scary.

978
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:41,560
Oh no.

979
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:42,460
Oh no.

980
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:44,540
I don't know what's going on.

981
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,760
Oh no, he's trying to disappear.

982
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:49,800
Oh my god.

983
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:53,520
All right, maybe- maybe we counter-disappear?

984
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,360
I don't- okay, let's go.

985
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:56,520
Oh.

986
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:58,400
Oh no.

987
00:52:58,660 --> 00:52:59,560
Oh no, he's gonna kill me.

988
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:00,520
He's gonna ki- No!

989
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,580
I keep forgetting.

990
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,080
I- oh my god.

991
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:05,780
This is my issue.

992
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:09,020
I need an ult after Fear Magneto.

993
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:14,640
I need an ult after Fear Magneto because that's like the counter to Fear.

994
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:19,940
I forgot because the other Magneto was so bad that I never had to think- like I never had to think about it.

995
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:27,560
This Mag- this Magneto knows the counter.

996
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,780
Knows the- Wait, what?

997
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:32,880
He knows the counter.

998
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:37,740
So I never had to like actually worry, but now I have to worry.

999
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:38,420
Yeah.

1000
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:43,000
I'm sorry to the- I'm sorry to the other Magneto, but it's true.

1001
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,820
That's literally the counter to like Cloak ult.

1002
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:51,100
The Magneto just ults the fucking Cloak ult and I need to- I need to like remember that.

1003
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,260
Jesus Christ, stop dying there.

1004
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,360
I'm gonna die to her, aren't I?

1005
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,960
Like stop dying there.

1006
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,860
Now I'm gonna die to her.

1007
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:05,520
Oh wait, I can do this because- no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1008
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:11,580
I'm scared because I don't want to- oh goodbye Magneto.

1009
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:13,220
Goodbye.

1010
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:14,260
Unless.

1011
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:16,260
Unless.

1012
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:19,240
I'm gonna wait until Magneto ults.

1013
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,660
I'm actually really scared of Magneto ults.

1014
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,680
He showed me.

1015
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:30,480
He showed me that I should fear him.

1016
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:38,020
He showed me that he is possibly better.

1017
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:43,440
So, so I don't know anymore.

1018
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,920
I don't know.

1019
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:52,820
Oh no, I don't want to get fucking- oh shit, Berserker.

1020
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:53,860
I'm saving my ult.

1021
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:57,560
If I don't hear fear, I never- I never ult again.

1022
00:54:58,640 --> 00:54:59,740
He's- he's waiting.

1023
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:00,580
He is.

1024
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:01,620
Do you see that?

1025
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:03,020
He's not even- he has it.

1026
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:04,380
There's no way he doesn't have it.

1027
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:07,600
That fucker has Magneto ult and he's waiting too.

1028
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:08,820
He fucking does.

1029
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:10,220
He does the counter.

1030
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,020
He's too smart for his own good.

1031
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:16,200
The mind games.

1032
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:19,860
Who's gonna outmine the other?

1033
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:21,220
We're playing chess right now.

1034
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:22,960
These people are playing checkers.

1035
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:26,140
Me and Magneto are playing fucking chess right now.

1036
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:29,160
Honestly.

1037
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:33,220
Time to see who has more patience.

1038
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:33,860
Yeah.

1039
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,900
Okay, it's fine.

1040
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,080
I can wait.

1041
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:40,740
I can wait forever.

1042
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:43,980
And before he still kills me with his ult.

1043
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:48,920
He fucking kills me in the ult and I waited for it.

1044
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:49,540
It's okay.

1045
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,240
I still have my ult if he kills me.

1046
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:54,320
I did- I wouldn't have wasted my ult because I'd be dead.

1047
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,360
Oh my god, this Magneto is not having a good time.

1048
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:59,240
Look what you did.

1049
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:00,940
You forced our Moon Knight onto Wolverine.

1050
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:01,740
Look what you did.

1051
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,400
This is your fault, enemy Wolverine.

1052
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,060
This is so your fault.

1053
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:11,220
I just never stop left clicking.

1054
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:12,500
This is like my strat.

1055
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:16,740
Like all I do is just left click until something happens.

1056
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,240
Alright, 61 fight.

1057
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,120
Actually, yeah, yeah, one fight.

1058
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,480
What's gonna happen?

1059
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:25,760
Can we kite this?

1060
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:26,420
Yeah, we can.

1061
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:27,820
You don't have to do anything.

1062
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,520
You can literally kite this.

1063
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,760
I wasn't gonna waste it.

1064
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,900
Oh my god, that's fucking right.

1065
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,040
Oh my god, that's right.

1066
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,620
Now it's my turn.

1067
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,280
That's fucking right.

1068
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,620
It's my turn.

1069
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:48,660
I saw you use it.

1070
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:51,620
I fucking saw you use it.

1071
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:52,560
That's right.

1072
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:56,620
Yeah, Magneto, I was more patient than you.

1073
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:59,400
Okay, but like...

1074
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:00,880
That's fucking right.

1075
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:03,640
Jesus Christ.

1076
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:04,740
Okay, I don't know.

1077
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:06,380
I think they can still touch this.

1078
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:07,640
I think...

1079
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,500
Yeah, they can still touch this, guys.

1080
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:12,220
They absolutely can still touch this.

1081
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:13,000
Oh, no.

1082
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,740
Oh, no, they're touching, guys.

1083
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:15,180
They're touching.

1084
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:17,560
Guys, guys, they're still touching, guys.

1085
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:18,600
We're in overtime.

1086
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,280
We're in overtime and they have Berserker Rage.

1087
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:24,040
We're in overtime.

1088
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:25,220
Oh, no.

1089
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:28,660
Oh, no, I thought... Okay, I legitimately... I thought he was gonna...

1090
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:34,060
Oh, I thought he was gonna be over there and then I was gonna blind him and everything, but I guess not.

1091
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:36,740
Oh, no, not this up here.

1092
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:38,600
Oh my god, not this up here.

1093
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:42,080
Oh my god, I don't know what's going on.

1094
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,200
I don't know what's going on.

1095
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:44,460
I hope everything is okay.

1096
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:45,960
I hope everybody is okay.

1097
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:48,120
We gotta touch the point, though.

1098
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,180
We gotta touch it.

1099
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:51,440
2.50 meters.

1100
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:54,880
Please.

1101
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,240
Oh my god, I'm gonna... My turn to DPS.

1102
00:57:58,720 --> 00:57:59,760
It's my turn.

1103
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:00,960
That's right.

1104
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:02,860
I saw Magneto die.

1105
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:03,820
I'm free.

1106
00:58:04,870 --> 00:58:06,020
I'm fucking free!

1107
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:12,390
Oh my god, we're okay.

1108
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:14,340
I'm free.

1109
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:16,800
Nice.

1110
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:17,880
He's dead.

1111
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,820
I can do whatever I want now.

1112
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:22,820
It's free real estate.

1113
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:25,820
No fear.

1114
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:27,900
No fucking fear.

1115
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,820
Where's my... His name is Poopchimp.

1116
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,340
He's... He's just... He's just a little guy.

1117
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:42,220
He's just... He's just a little guy in this Marvel Rivals world.

1118
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,220
Is he a Wolverine?

1119
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:47,200
Is he actually a Wolverine?

1120
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,040
Why the fuck was he on Moon Knight?

1121
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:50,540
Also, hey, sure for it.

1122
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,240
It was Moon Knight earlier.

1123
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,760
Why are you solo queuing?

1124
00:58:58,180 --> 00:58:58,620
Go man.

1125
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,100
Yeah, why are you solo queuing?

1126
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:06,140
You got bullied off of... Yeah, he was Moon Knight at first.

1127
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:07,280
Are you a game surfer?

1128
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:09,460
I saw you were in the 20 minute queue in Celestia.

1129
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:14,820
I was like, holy fuck.

1130
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,400
And you were like solo Celestia too.

1131
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:19,860
Like...

1132
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:23,500
Yeah, but like 20... Damn, like that's crazy.

1133
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:27,040
20 minute queue... 20 minute queue in solo queue.

1134
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:28,540
That sounds like hell.

1135
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:31,180
Sounds like fucking hell.

1136
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:36,060
It wasn't... Did it go to... I heard... So I had like 17 plus minutes at one point.

1137
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,480
Oh, it was 55!

1138
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:44,500
Oh my god.

1139
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,900
I do hear voices in my head.

1140
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:49,080
That's rough, buddy.

1141
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:50,900
That's fucking rough.

1142
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:52,920
Holy shit.

1143
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:55,220
That's good.

1144
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:56,100
That's crazy though.

1145
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:57,500
Congrats on top 10 solo.

1146
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,220
That's really cool.

1147
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:02,640
But 55 minutes...

1148
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:08,960
That's actually... That does not sound fun at all.

1149
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:11,020
Where's the other support?

1150
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,680
I'm just gonna... I'll heal.

1151
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:16,800
I guess I'll heal Magneto until something happens.

1152
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,260
Oh, that's fine.

1153
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:22,360
He's so healthy.

1154
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,420
You're so healthy, JT.

1155
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:26,160
I believe in you.

1156
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,220
I believe in you so much.

1157
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:31,700
No, that's not gonna be me.

1158
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:33,400
I refuse.

1159
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:35,360
I refuse to let that happen to me.

1160
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:36,620
I'm just gonna keep JT up.

1161
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:37,580
You guys do your thing.

1162
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:38,000
I'm just...

1163
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,300
I'm just making sure JT doesn't fucking die.

1164
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:46,440
I'm barely getting like ult charge though.

1165
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:48,240
Mr. JT.

1166
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:49,680
Oh, yeah.

1167
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:51,180
Oh, I'm lucky.

1168
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:52,280
I thought I could...

1169
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:53,580
Wait.

1170
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:54,940
Oh, whoa.

1171
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:55,240
Whoa.

1172
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:56,740
You're all so fucking low.

1173
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:57,520
Mr. JT.

1174
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:58,680
No, don't die on me.

1175
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:01,300
All right.

1176
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:04,220
Don't make our Moon Knight go fucking Wolverine.

1177
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:05,280
Don't make him do it.

1178
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,120
He just wants to chill on Moon Knight.

1179
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:08,420
Don't make him do it.

1180
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:10,480
If you don't give us the point, he's gonna do it.

1181
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:11,080
He's gonna...

1182
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:15,080
He's gonna fucking...

1183
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:16,560
He's gonna go Wolverine.

1184
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:18,100
You don't like that, Magneto?

1185
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:22,140
Let us have a good time where he's gonna go Wolverine.

1186
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:25,620
What the fuck am I gonna do here?

1187
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:28,580
I don't want to use disappear because... I'm not disappearing, am I?

1188
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:32,880
Whoa!

1189
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:35,180
Oh, I'm dead.

1190
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:36,600
I'm fucking dead.

1191
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:37,860
I...

1192
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:46,380
I'm just scared Magneto's gonna ult me the moment I do.

1193
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:47,500
It's my ult.

1194
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:48,640
I have to hold it.

1195
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:52,740
I had to hold it.

1196
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:53,960
I didn't think he'd look at me.

1197
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:57,080
I was gonna be like, okay, I'm gonna float away now, but he looked at me.

1198
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:58,500
That's fucked up.

1199
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:00,680
How could he look at me like that?

1200
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:02,340
They do.

1201
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:03,760
It's Mr. Bad Boy.

1202
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:05,020
He still has his ult.

1203
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:09,000
Bad Boy still has his ult.

1204
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:09,980
He's keeping it.

1205
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:11,260
Oh, they use another support ult.

1206
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:12,200
Are they also triple support?

1207
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:12,760
Yeah, they are.

1208
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:13,540
No fuck.

1209
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:17,220
I'm having... we will only have fun if we win.

1210
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:17,860
Oh my god.

1211
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:18,680
Nice.

1212
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:19,380
Got it.

1213
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:23,140
Me and the other...

1214
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:24,140
Wait, what?

1215
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:24,640
Okay.

1216
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:26,460
Here, Magneto.

1217
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:27,880
I'm fucking waiting for you.

1218
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,060
Look, he has it!

1219
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:30,740
You know this freak has it!

1220
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:32,040
You know he has it!

1221
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,220
Oh, you don't get to use it now, you fucking freak!

1222
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:37,500
That's why we're waiting for 20 years for me to use mine.

1223
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,260
Look what happened, Magneto.

1224
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:41,640
You made him turn Wolverine.

1225
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:48,760
You could have used your ult and now you made Poopchimp go Wolverine.

1226
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:53,500
That's lucky, right?

1227
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,180
Now you'll never have fun.

1228
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,880
He's on Wolverine now because he couldn't play.

1229
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:59,620
Oh, yeah, you want to go again?

1230
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:00,480
That's lucky, right?

1231
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:02,780
Jesus Christ.

1232
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:03,360
You know what?

1233
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:03,860
Fuck it.

1234
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:05,320
That's it!

1235
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:05,780
I told you!

1236
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:07,160
I fucking told you!

1237
01:03:09,770 --> 01:03:10,810
I got away!

1238
01:03:11,130 --> 01:03:11,570
I live!

1239
01:03:11,930 --> 01:03:12,530
I live!

1240
01:03:13,210 --> 01:03:13,930
That's lucky, right?

1241
01:03:14,030 --> 01:03:15,190
Couldn't even kill me!

1242
01:03:16,810 --> 01:03:17,890
That's lucky, right?

1243
01:03:18,350 --> 01:03:19,310
Oh my god.

1244
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:20,610
You deserve it.

1245
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:21,830
You fucking deserve it.

1246
01:03:21,870 --> 01:03:22,990
I'm fucking coming over.

1247
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:25,190
That was so tight.

1248
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:26,030
I told you.

1249
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:27,810
I told you.

1250
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:31,630
He literally keeps it for a while.

1251
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:32,870
That was like gambling.

1252
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:39,370
I literally gambled for that because I knew he was gonna ult me and I was hoping to dear god I could make it to the house.

1253
01:03:39,490 --> 01:03:43,350
I legitimately gambled everything for the house, guys.

1254
01:03:43,850 --> 01:03:48,570
The house was literally my gamble.

1255
01:03:49,890 --> 01:03:54,470
Okay, I'm just gonna do this until my ult's over.

1256
01:03:55,150 --> 01:03:55,970
It's taking over.

1257
01:03:56,310 --> 01:03:58,590
They have legendary too, so I'm a little scared.

1258
01:03:59,770 --> 01:04:03,550
I'm a little scared of the- I'm a little scared about it.

1259
01:04:03,630 --> 01:04:04,830
Oh my god, that's right.

1260
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:08,890
I'm gonna fucking- I'm gonna DPS.

1261
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:11,770
It's my turn except I need to heal my- I need to heal.

1262
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:13,650
Oh, I'm fucking- I'm gonna kill you.

1263
01:04:18,070 --> 01:04:20,570
E Compton, thank you for the 10 gifted subs.

1264
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:21,010
Thank you.

1265
01:04:21,050 --> 01:04:21,790
Thank you.

1266
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:24,670
I really appreciate it.

1267
01:04:24,670 --> 01:04:26,030
Thank you so much.

1268
01:04:30,470 --> 01:04:31,530
That's all right.

1269
01:04:31,630 --> 01:04:35,050
Are you sure you're not a Cloak and Dagger main?

1270
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:37,570
Peer Magneto.

1271
01:04:38,130 --> 01:04:39,850
No longer do I fear.

1272
01:04:40,830 --> 01:04:42,350
Another epic victory.

1273
01:04:43,090 --> 01:04:43,830
I did it.

1274
01:04:43,910 --> 01:04:44,790
I fucking learned.

1275
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:46,510
Yeah, GM won.

1276
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:47,390
Let's go.

1277
01:04:48,290 --> 01:04:49,670
I did it.

1278
01:04:50,530 --> 01:04:51,110
Yippee.

1279
01:04:51,710 --> 01:04:52,410
We're climbing.

1280
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:55,610
I'm gonna- oh my gosh.

1281
01:04:55,690 --> 01:04:57,050
I don't know if I want to jinx it.

1282
01:04:57,570 --> 01:04:58,430
I don't know.

1283
01:04:58,590 --> 01:05:03,310
I feel like- I say that and now things are not gonna be so good for me.

1284
01:05:03,410 --> 01:05:04,710
Did I get- did I finally get Lord?

1285
01:05:04,830 --> 01:05:08,470
No, I still need- I don't even know how much I need for it.

1286
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:11,130
I need like a little bit more for Lord.

1287
01:05:11,710 --> 01:05:12,870
What's my current leaderboard?

1288
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:14,330
I'm 75.

1289
01:05:14,970 --> 01:05:16,710
I went from 200 to 75.

1290
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:17,810
Let's fucking go.

1291
01:05:18,450 --> 01:05:19,110
What are you sure for?

1292
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:20,090
Oh, he's right there.

1293
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:20,810
You're rank 9.

1294
01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:27,790
This guy's almost- this guy's nipping on your- on your- on your- on your ankles right now.

1295
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:29,930
He's coming to get your rank.

1296
01:05:30,650 --> 01:05:31,070
He's coming.

1297
01:05:31,370 --> 01:05:32,250
He lost.

1298
01:05:34,490 --> 01:05:36,190
These two are coming to get it.

1299
01:05:36,690 --> 01:05:40,370
I got 9 from- I was 10 before- wait, really?

1300
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:42,010
You beat this guy?

1301
01:05:42,530 --> 01:05:43,390
Senior Huff?

1302
01:05:43,830 --> 01:05:47,390
You took his ELO to take- and then take his page 1?

1303
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:49,050
That's so fucked.

1304
01:05:49,530 --> 01:05:54,010
That's- Oh, wow, you're very cute.

1305
01:05:54,390 --> 01:05:58,570
You did absolutely nothing and you took this man's ELO.

1306
01:05:59,090 --> 01:06:00,190
That's fucked, man.

1307
01:06:00,310 --> 01:06:03,310
That's also- that's also equally as fucked.

1308
01:06:04,050 --> 01:06:05,270
Just did nothing.

1309
01:06:05,810 --> 01:06:07,150
Not took his page.

1310
01:06:07,990 --> 01:06:09,810
It's free real estate.

1311
01:06:10,490 --> 01:06:11,130
Yippee!

1312
01:06:12,950 --> 01:06:15,410
Oh my gosh, it's like only...

1313
01:06:16,010 --> 01:06:20,110
I guess like 1, 2, 3, 4...

1314
01:06:20,130 --> 01:06:23,010
5- 5 pages of GM1.

1315
01:06:23,410 --> 01:06:25,750
It's not that big of a gap, I feel like.

1316
01:06:27,110 --> 01:06:28,870
I'm like 75 right now.

1317
01:06:29,470 --> 01:06:30,470
I'm rank 75.

1318
01:06:31,730 --> 01:06:32,690
Top 100!

1319
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:33,410
Yeah!

1320
01:06:37,050 --> 01:06:37,890
Two wins?

1321
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:38,250
Yeah.

1322
01:06:38,730 --> 01:06:39,930
I- I noticed that.

1323
01:06:40,010 --> 01:06:44,650
I noticed that you can climb really- you- Uh, you climb really fast in the higher ELO.

1324
01:06:45,470 --> 01:06:47,310
And this is where I am at right now.

1325
01:06:50,130 --> 01:06:54,790
When is, um, schedule Doki Marvel Rivals crash out?

1326
01:06:55,010 --> 01:06:57,790
You see, I'm streaming- I'm streaming short today.

1327
01:06:57,950 --> 01:07:00,130
So there's no- no crash out today.

1328
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:03,390
Is playing healer that easy?

1329
01:07:05,710 --> 01:07:07,090
I won't say easy.

1330
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:08,490
It's just I think like...

1331
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:10,630
For me, it's less stressful.

1332
01:07:11,590 --> 01:07:16,150
It's less stressful than playing DPS and tank because like your team doesn't rely you for kills.

1333
01:07:16,310 --> 01:07:18,970
They just- Playing support is literally mind games.

1334
01:07:19,150 --> 01:07:23,580
Like- Because like, you see like me and Magneto are just like...

1335
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:26,110
We're just- we're playing chess there.

1336
01:07:26,470 --> 01:07:30,050
Where I was like, I won't ult if- I will never ult until you ult.

1337
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:32,790
And then Magneto was like, Well, I won't ult until you ult.

1338
01:07:33,030 --> 01:07:35,150
And then I was like, you know, I'm gonna risk it all.

1339
01:07:35,270 --> 01:07:36,430
I'm gonna- let's go gambling.

1340
01:07:36,650 --> 01:07:38,110
I have this house behind me.

1341
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:39,710
Surely he won't hit me.

1342
01:07:39,830 --> 01:07:41,650
And then I won the gamble.

1343
01:07:42,050 --> 01:07:42,790
Like, I won!

1344
01:07:43,220 --> 01:07:48,810
I- I don't know how I- how I lived there, but thank god the house was the strat.

1345
01:07:49,790 --> 01:07:51,930
Just wait, don't fear.

1346
01:07:53,870 --> 01:07:56,430
Yeah, it was actually- it was so scary.

1347
01:07:58,170 --> 01:07:59,850
I actually outplayed him.

1348
01:08:00,270 --> 01:08:01,990
I'm always three steps ahead.

1349
01:08:04,770 --> 01:08:08,270
Always three- because he knows I can cancel his ult instantly.

1350
01:08:11,350 --> 01:08:13,050
That's why he doesn't want to do anything.

1351
01:08:13,170 --> 01:08:18,070
He didn't want to use it because if I'm alive, I literally just wasted his ult with just one ability.

1352
01:08:19,350 --> 01:08:20,670
I just go teehee.

1353
01:08:24,490 --> 01:08:27,130
Wait, I dropped.

1354
01:08:27,510 --> 01:08:28,210
What the fuck?

1355
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:28,730
Who climbed?

1356
01:08:29,270 --> 01:08:29,910
How dare you?

1357
01:08:30,970 --> 01:08:33,510
Oh no, I hope I don't- I don't- I don't drop.

1358
01:08:33,850 --> 01:08:34,910
I hope I don't drop.

1359
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:35,330
Oh my god.

1360
01:08:35,330 --> 01:08:37,350
This guy was like below my rank.

1361
01:08:37,650 --> 01:08:40,650
If we win- oh wait, no, this guy was above me.

1362
01:08:40,730 --> 01:08:41,970
If we win, we take his rank.

1363
01:08:47,130 --> 01:08:50,590
Oh, hey, it's the Wolverine one trick again.

1364
01:08:52,310 --> 01:08:55,530
I'm going to ego you because I need to practice for the tournament.

1365
01:08:57,970 --> 01:09:03,890
I wonder if they'll have- if they'll try and ban, um, if they'll try and ban Wolverine or not.

1366
01:09:04,550 --> 01:09:06,090
Poop chimp versus ball.

1367
01:09:10,150 --> 01:09:16,310
I think I'm getting some good practice in.

1368
01:09:16,790 --> 01:09:17,650
Not gonna lie.

1369
01:09:20,210 --> 01:09:21,010
I don't know.

1370
01:09:21,230 --> 01:09:24,070
I feel like I'm getting- oh wait, we don't have a tank player.

1371
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:25,490
That's awkward.

1372
01:09:26,210 --> 01:09:30,550
Oh, that's so- What if we just ban every tank possible?

1373
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:34,270
Oh, that's so- oh, this is- It's all right.

1374
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:35,970
Our first loss, that's fine.

1375
01:09:36,390 --> 01:09:39,830
I- I- you know, we've been winning a lot, you know, we've been...

1376
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:41,450
We've been winning a lot.

1377
01:09:41,530 --> 01:09:43,850
I don't mind our first loss, I guess.

1378
01:09:44,070 --> 01:09:44,530
I don't know.

1379
01:09:44,590 --> 01:09:45,150
It's all right.

1380
01:09:45,530 --> 01:09:46,150
It's all right.

1381
01:09:49,770 --> 01:09:52,550
Oh wait, I can snipe on and off.

1382
01:09:52,890 --> 01:09:56,170
Not if I ban- I know all your ults are sure for.

1383
01:09:56,270 --> 01:09:56,630
I'll just...

1384
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:58,050
ban...

1385
01:09:58,050 --> 01:09:58,810
Widow.

1386
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:06,650
That's fucking right, I'll do it.

1387
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:10,010
I'll fucking- even if you're on my team, I'll ban Widow.

1388
01:10:10,070 --> 01:10:11,330
I'll waste a ban, just...

1389
01:10:13,850 --> 01:10:17,410
Oh, just like the last time we got in a team together.

1390
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:20,870
And then we lost, but like, it was worth it.

1391
01:10:21,310 --> 01:10:22,470
It was so worth it.

1392
01:10:28,670 --> 01:10:31,350
All right, I'm good.

1393
01:10:33,410 --> 01:10:37,330
Oh, I'm toxic for banning the character?

1394
01:10:37,890 --> 01:10:44,250
Of a- of a streamer that literally said, I'm gonna snipe you on an ult and lock Black Widow.

1395
01:10:44,450 --> 01:10:47,330
But I'm the toxic one, I see.

1396
01:10:47,770 --> 01:10:48,150
I-

1397
01:10:54,230 --> 01:10:56,990
I'm the fucking toxic one.

1398
01:11:01,070 --> 01:11:02,470
All right.

1399
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:09,370
Oh no.

1400
01:11:10,370 --> 01:11:14,210
Oh no, now he can't swap to Wolverine anymore.

1401
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:16,210
No, what do we do?

1402
01:11:17,790 --> 01:11:19,250
Wolverine can't swap.

1403
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:22,370
Oh no, this is terrible.

1404
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:25,410
He can't get mad and swap to...

1405
01:11:26,030 --> 01:11:26,590
Wolverine.

1406
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:27,690
He banned him.

1407
01:11:28,610 --> 01:11:30,050
Now he's fucking nerfed.

1408
01:11:30,670 --> 01:11:32,670
Oh, I hate this part of the map though.

1409
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:35,830
This part of the map fucking- I'm like predicting where they are.

1410
01:11:36,010 --> 01:11:37,190
I hope he's okay.

1411
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:48,910
I- I- I predicted that they're there and it was a gamble that I was willing to take.

1412
01:11:51,290 --> 01:11:53,330
Oh my god, can you reload though?

1413
01:11:54,490 --> 01:11:55,170
He's fine.

1414
01:11:55,730 --> 01:11:56,590
He's so healthy.

1415
01:11:56,810 --> 01:11:57,570
He's so healthy.

1416
01:11:57,650 --> 01:11:58,290
He's so healthy.

1417
01:11:58,430 --> 01:12:03,010
He's- How the- how much damage was this man taking?

1418
01:12:04,510 --> 01:12:05,870
Holy shit!

1419
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:08,530
It's not fair.

1420
01:12:08,610 --> 01:12:10,290
They have two tank players and we have zero.

1421
01:12:11,310 --> 01:12:12,310
That's not fair.

1422
01:12:14,650 --> 01:12:15,030
What?

1423
01:12:16,710 --> 01:12:23,130
Wait, what the fuck am I gonna do with two- one tank player or zero tank player for one thing?

1424
01:12:24,670 --> 01:12:27,870
All right, guys, this is looking a little rough right now.

1425
01:12:27,930 --> 01:12:30,230
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1426
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:38,790
Guys, you know when he said I was only good at- I was only good at like Wolverine.

1427
01:12:38,970 --> 01:12:40,910
I think he's- I don't think he was lying.

1428
01:12:41,970 --> 01:12:46,390
I don't- I don't think that guy was lying.

1429
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:51,700
All right, we wait.

1430
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:54,540
I- I don't think it was a joke, guys.

1431
01:12:54,860 --> 01:12:57,760
I think he was real- I think he was serious when he said that.

1432
01:12:59,180 --> 01:13:02,000
I thought it was a funny hee-hee-ha-ha joke, you know?

1433
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:07,120
I- No way, that'll be fine, right?

1434
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:08,400
I'll use it.

1435
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:09,360
Okay, there you go.

1436
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:11,420
All right, let's all dance.

1437
01:13:13,340 --> 01:13:14,620
Oh, I fell down.

1438
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:15,300
This is not good.

1439
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:16,180
Oh.

1440
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:24,140
No, this- Oh my god, I got- Why did you shoot it?

1441
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:27,000
Why did you shoot it?

1442
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:29,140
I can't hide from it!

1443
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:30,380
I can't!

1444
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:33,520
There was no way to hide from it.

1445
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:37,540
I was like this- If you shoot the magneto, it gets stronger.

1446
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:43,200
And I know for sure somebody shot the magneto because I died from it.

1447
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:48,880
I refuse to believe that nobody- that that was not shot.

1448
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:51,400
I refuse to believe that.

1449
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:54,300
Oh, no, I'm fucking dead.

1450
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:56,360
Bum-bum-bum-bum.

1451
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:56,960
No!

1452
01:13:57,580 --> 01:13:58,940
I can't do anything!

1453
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:02,720
Honestly?

1454
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:05,320
I don't know.

1455
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:08,380
I don't know if I should play Cloak and dagger.

1456
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:10,220
I just don't think we should have a mantis.

1457
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:13,120
I think it should be Luna, Cloak, and dagger.

1458
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:14,760
Honestly.

1459
01:14:15,860 --> 01:14:19,040
I think Luna, Cloak, and dagger would actually win us this game.

1460
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,120
Or triple support.

1461
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:26,360
Oh, they're running.

1462
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,180
Yeah, they're running triple support.

1463
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:29,260
That's what I'm saying.

1464
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:30,360
Mantis is not good anymore.

1465
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:33,200
She's like...

1466
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:33,600
Uh...

1467
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,120
She's not...

1468
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:36,440
Um...

1469
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:37,920
Her...

1470
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:40,140
Her cloak and dagger is just stronger.

1471
01:14:41,820 --> 01:14:45,740
Well, I don't play dagger or suit.

1472
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:46,200
Okay.

1473
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:48,020
All right, go play Luna.

1474
01:14:50,170 --> 01:14:53,740
You know, our other support player is...

1475
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:57,420
Do you play Luna?

1476
01:14:57,420 --> 01:14:57,480
Luna?

1477
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:00,220
Okay.

1478
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:02,560
I think Luna's better here.

1479
01:15:04,020 --> 01:15:04,540
Yes.

1480
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:05,260
Okay, swap.

1481
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:06,760
Swap you, whore.

1482
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:07,640
Come on, swap.

1483
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:08,180
There you go.

1484
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:10,340
See, I call everyone whore.

1485
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:11,780
Just like this guy.

1486
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:13,600
That's just like this guy.

1487
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:14,260
That's right, whore.

1488
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:15,240
Don't worry.

1489
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:15,820
It's not...

1490
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:19,900
It's not a derogative term because I call everybody whores.

1491
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:21,420
Capture the mission area.

1492
01:15:21,860 --> 01:15:23,760
Whore, whore, whore, whore.

1493
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:25,600
Whore, whore, whore, whore.

1494
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:26,600
It's like a nickname.

1495
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:27,820
Yeah, it's like a little nickname.

1496
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,000
It's like affectionately.

1497
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:33,460
All right.

1498
01:15:34,580 --> 01:15:43,960
I like how I've played cloak and dagger three games in a row, but I'm supposed to practice Luna because our other support is playing cloak and dagger.

1499
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:45,940
Like...

1500
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:49,880
Oh my god, I'm supposed to freaking practice.

1501
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:52,440
Oh my god, I'm supposed to practice...

1502
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:55,620
others Luna right now.

1503
01:15:56,730 --> 01:15:59,080
I'm not supposed to play her.

1504
01:16:01,850 --> 01:16:04,970
I'm not even getting practice in.

1505
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:08,960
Okay, that's fine.

1506
01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:12,060
I'm okay with that.

1507
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:15,420
Rp is more important.

1508
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:19,540
It's all right.

1509
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:20,900
Everything is fine.

1510
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:22,820
Everything is okay.

1511
01:16:22,940 --> 01:16:23,820
I think like...

1512
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:25,860
I think...

1513
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:30,060
Poopchamp is a really good player, but only on one character.

1514
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:32,560
So like, I don't know guys.

1515
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:36,080
I don't... I don't feel so good.

1516
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:38,320
Oh, wait, what?

1517
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:39,900
Did he miss?

1518
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:42,620
Haha, what was that?

1519
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:44,720
Did he miss?

1520
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:47,140
Shoot him.

1521
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:47,900
Shoot him.

1522
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:49,280
That's right.

1523
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:50,060
That's what happens.

1524
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:50,820
That's right.

1525
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:52,380
You saw what happens guys.

1526
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,200
Oh my god.

1527
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:57,980
Oh my god.

1528
01:16:58,400 --> 01:16:59,660
Oh my god.

1529
01:16:59,700 --> 01:16:59,900
Okay.

1530
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:00,640
Okay.

1531
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:01,860
Oh, we double support ulted.

1532
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:02,660
That is my bad.

1533
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:04,460
I... I don't like, um...

1534
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:07,980
I don't like Fantas... uh, invisible women's, um...

1535
01:17:08,660 --> 01:17:09,400
Ults down.

1536
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:10,300
It's so hard to hear.

1537
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:14,340
It's... it's really hard to hear.

1538
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:18,620
I... I can never tell like, when she ults because of it.

1539
01:17:18,740 --> 01:17:20,800
I like... like, this appears really good.

1540
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:23,060
Because it's like... but like, what was it?

1541
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:24,140
Something... something shield.

1542
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,980
Yeah, it's very hard to hear because... so like, I always get like, fucked up.

1543
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:29,920
I was accidentally double support ulting her ult.

1544
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:32,520
Because I could never tell when she ults it.

1545
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:35,460
Because she's invisible.

1546
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:39,760
Bum bum ba dum.

1547
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,880
Bum ba dum ba dum.

1548
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:43,960
Bum bum ba dum.

1549
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:46,080
Bum bum ba dum.

1550
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:48,560
I'm going... this is gonna kill me, isn't it?

1551
01:17:49,060 --> 01:17:50,800
I... I have a... well, never mind.

1552
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:52,080
It's just gonna kill my entire team.

1553
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:00,060
It's just gonna kill my entire team.

1554
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:01,180
They still have Magneto ult.

1555
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:04,000
I don't think he... I don't know if he realized I ulted.

1556
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,040
Are you saving it for my next ult?

1557
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:07,820
You're just saving it for next round.

1558
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:10,760
If only we had a support ult.

1559
01:18:10,940 --> 01:18:11,380
If only.

1560
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:13,360
Okay, but you don't know who ulted first.

1561
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:15,580
It could... I could have ulted first and then she fucked up.

1562
01:18:15,980 --> 01:18:17,560
And I'm not gonna open up the replay.

1563
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:18,640
I'm gonna go with that.

1564
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:21,500
What?

1565
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,260
Oh my god.

1566
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:30,180
Oh my god.

1567
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:32,120
Holy shit.

1568
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:35,980
Bro, what the fuck?

1569
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:38,880
Just because he fucking ulted?

1570
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:40,080
Okay.

1571
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:42,180
Oh no.

1572
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:47,460
Okay, that did not save anybody, but that's okay.

1573
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:51,660
Okay, I still died.

1574
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:53,040
It didn't matter.

1575
01:18:55,340 --> 01:18:56,940
Hey, I lived though.

1576
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:00,040
Guys, I lived.

1577
01:19:05,930 --> 01:19:07,990
I lived from the Magneto ult.

1578
01:19:08,050 --> 01:19:08,990
That's all that matters.

1579
01:19:09,050 --> 01:19:10,760
No, I lived through the Magneto ult.

1580
01:19:15,590 --> 01:19:16,250
Okay.

1581
01:19:17,630 --> 01:19:19,170
We just realized.

1582
01:19:20,390 --> 01:19:21,430
Who did I avoid?

1583
01:19:21,990 --> 01:19:23,990
I mean, he's really good.

1584
01:19:24,870 --> 01:19:25,530
He's...

1585
01:19:25,530 --> 01:19:29,230
He's really, really good at Wolverine.

1586
01:19:29,730 --> 01:19:30,530
That's it.

1587
01:19:31,470 --> 01:19:32,670
That's it, unfortunately.

1588
01:19:33,730 --> 01:19:40,310
Unfortunately, now that we know he's only good at Wolverine, we can now avoid him and target ban him.

1589
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:41,870
And that's just life.

1590
01:19:43,310 --> 01:19:44,870
Just don't be a one trick.

1591
01:19:45,590 --> 01:19:46,890
That's the lesson here.

1592
01:19:47,110 --> 01:19:49,150
Just don't be a fucking one trick.

1593
01:19:51,470 --> 01:19:52,890
Literally nothing else.

1594
01:19:53,130 --> 01:19:54,830
I like how he was so direct with us too.

1595
01:19:54,910 --> 01:19:56,830
He was like, I can't play anything else guys.

1596
01:19:56,930 --> 01:19:57,790
I'm like, oh.

1597
01:19:58,370 --> 01:19:58,770
Okay.

1598
01:20:00,350 --> 01:20:00,830
Thanks.

1599
01:20:00,830 --> 01:20:02,690
Okay, I guess we avoid you?

1600
01:20:05,770 --> 01:20:06,630
I guess.

1601
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:07,690
Okay.

1602
01:20:09,130 --> 01:20:09,930
Thanks, bro.

1603
01:20:09,950 --> 01:20:11,230
At least he's... true, true.

1604
01:20:11,310 --> 01:20:12,270
At least he's honest.

1605
01:20:13,310 --> 01:20:14,410
I didn't even got here.

1606
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:15,350
I don't know.

1607
01:20:15,470 --> 01:20:18,750
I feel like Wolverine is so target banned a lot.

1608
01:20:19,370 --> 01:20:21,490
That's he... I don't know how he squirmed his way in here.

1609
01:20:21,870 --> 01:20:23,850
Like, wait, what is his rank actually?

1610
01:20:24,130 --> 01:20:24,550
I'll check.

1611
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:29,030
Um...

1612
01:20:30,110 --> 01:20:31,190
Uh, history.

1613
01:20:31,610 --> 01:20:32,510
Okay, there you go.

1614
01:20:32,630 --> 01:20:33,950
Uh, what is it?

1615
01:20:34,730 --> 01:20:35,450
What is this?

1616
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:36,090
Oh, okay.

1617
01:20:37,030 --> 01:20:40,350
But I have other ways to find you, my boy.

1618
01:20:40,870 --> 01:20:47,190
I can find you via other ways.

1619
01:20:49,710 --> 01:20:50,290
Jesus.

1620
01:20:51,270 --> 01:20:52,270
Oh shit, wait.

1621
01:20:52,370 --> 01:20:53,730
Actually, I don't think I can.

1622
01:20:54,110 --> 01:20:54,670
Never mind.

1623
01:20:55,030 --> 01:20:56,390
Oh, never mind.

1624
01:20:56,490 --> 01:20:58,510
He actually... wait, I...

1625
01:20:58,510 --> 01:20:59,570
Wait, wait a minute.

1626
01:21:00,090 --> 01:21:01,130
What is it?

1627
01:21:01,210 --> 01:21:02,750
I will find you.

1628
01:21:03,010 --> 01:21:03,690
Oh, wait.

1629
01:21:03,790 --> 01:21:05,430
He actually... he covered his tracks.

1630
01:21:05,550 --> 01:21:06,310
God damn it.

1631
01:21:07,050 --> 01:21:07,530
He...

1632
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:09,470
He... he covered his tracks.

1633
01:21:09,550 --> 01:21:10,450
I can't find him.

1634
01:21:10,910 --> 01:21:12,250
Oh, you're so lucky.

1635
01:21:12,670 --> 01:21:13,590
You're so lucky.

1636
01:21:13,710 --> 01:21:14,530
Would it... come on.

1637
01:21:14,590 --> 01:21:16,030
Give me your player UID.

1638
01:21:17,970 --> 01:21:18,450
No,

1639
01:21:22,270 --> 01:21:23,650
I don't think he's on the leaderboard.

1640
01:21:23,830 --> 01:21:24,590
I don't think so.

1641
01:21:24,710 --> 01:21:25,150
Is he?

1642
01:21:26,330 --> 01:21:27,290
I don't...

1643
01:21:27,290 --> 01:21:27,990
I don't think so.

1644
01:21:28,070 --> 01:21:30,050
I don't think I can get his player UID from that.

1645
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:31,370
Oh, he is?

1646
01:21:31,730 --> 01:21:32,390
Oh, okay.

1647
01:21:35,420 --> 01:21:35,860
Okay.

1648
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:36,800
Poop.

1649
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:38,500
Oh, he is!

1650
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:39,800
He's ranked 159?

1651
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:41,700
Oh my god.

1652
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:43,820
That... I definitely dropped.

1653
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:44,980
How much did I drop?

1654
01:21:45,620 --> 01:21:46,640
Okay, I'm still ahead.

1655
01:21:46,780 --> 01:21:48,180
Oh, I got out of top 100.

1656
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:52,220
Poop.

1657
01:21:52,220 --> 01:21:52,280
Poop.

1658
01:21:55,220 --> 01:21:56,740
Snake, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

1659
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:57,060
Thank you.

1660
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:57,960
Thank you.

1661
01:21:59,220 --> 01:21:59,580
Uh...

1662
01:21:59,580 --> 01:22:01,600
Uh, Zai, thank you for the 100 bitties.

1663
01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:01,980
Thank you.

1664
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:02,760
Thank you.

1665
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:04,820
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1666
01:22:04,860 --> 01:22:07,500
You drop a lot, but you also gain a lot, too.

1667
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:10,280
Uh...

1668
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:11,960
I have no idea who these people are.

1669
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:13,980
I got a lot of random friend requests now.

1670
01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:17,720
I'm sorry, I don't know who you are.

1671
01:22:17,780 --> 01:22:18,440
I'm sorry.

1672
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:21,340
I'm so sorry.

1673
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:22,880
Who are you?

1674
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:23,660
Wait, what?

1675
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:25,160
Is this Heelys?

1676
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:26,020
What the fuck?

1677
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:29,220
No, no, I have him on my friends list already.

1678
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:30,820
I have Doki Brite Fat.

1679
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:31,680
What the fuck?

1680
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:32,340
That's me.

1681
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,140
Wait, that's me.

1682
01:22:40,340 --> 01:22:40,820
Imposter.

1683
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:42,460
Fucking imposter.

1684
01:22:44,020 --> 01:22:46,040
The real Doki Brite.

1685
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:46,880
That's me.

1686
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:48,380
That's fucking me.

1687
01:22:52,370 --> 01:22:55,310
Oh, my win rate is not...

1688
01:22:55,310 --> 01:22:57,190
Okay, but look at this win rate, though.

1689
01:22:57,510 --> 01:23:00,490
Okay, but look at this win rate.

1690
01:23:00,850 --> 01:23:01,570
I told you.

1691
01:23:06,050 --> 01:23:08,170
That's the one that matters, guys.

1692
01:23:08,510 --> 01:23:09,870
That's... Oh, it's Frank Castle.

1693
01:23:09,970 --> 01:23:13,630
As long as Frank Castle gets to play Punisher, we should be fine.

1694
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:18,840
Should be fine.

1695
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:19,640
They don't know.

1696
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:20,940
How would they know?

1697
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:24,880
If it isn't the Psylocke.

1698
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:28,080
Oh shit, Final Fantasy 7.

1699
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:30,840
Dude, you guys are... Why'd you guys ban my Punisher?

1700
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:31,440
What the hell?

1701
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:34,580
Bro, your name is Frank Castle.

1702
01:23:34,780 --> 01:23:35,860
That's Lily Punisher's name.

1703
01:23:36,020 --> 01:23:37,040
I don't know how to play him.

1704
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:40,360
I've never played him like once in my... You have a lord mastery.

1705
01:23:40,460 --> 01:23:41,300
What are you talking about?

1706
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:42,460
All right, let's ban Wolverine.

1707
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:44,340
I ain't here to get Wolverine.

1708
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:45,560
I ain't here.

1709
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:46,940
How are you scared of Storm?

1710
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:49,840
I start dancing and she's irrelevant.

1711
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:51,720
Frank Castle and then I go Widow.

1712
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:56,980
This is not the voice I expected from a Punisher one-trick.

1713
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:02,440
Oh, we forgot.

1714
01:24:03,380 --> 01:24:05,740
How are we getting every fucking one-trick in existence?

1715
01:24:06,260 --> 01:24:07,960
Why are they on my team?

1716
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:10,420
Low-key?

1717
01:24:11,900 --> 01:24:14,500
Why are they on my team?

1718
01:24:14,580 --> 01:24:15,460
I don't understand.

1719
01:24:21,380 --> 01:24:22,560
All right, here we go.

1720
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:25,520
Guys, I'm changing my username.

1721
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:28,200
Can someone give me two dollars so I can change my username?

1722
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:32,960
I don't even know who this guy is.

1723
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:34,360
Any Mantis players?

1724
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:38,240
Frank does meta?

1725
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:39,060
I refuse.

1726
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:40,660
I NEED TO PRACTICE LUDO.

1727
01:24:40,820 --> 01:24:41,540
I don't care.

1728
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:46,160
Bro, send this bro to...

1729
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:47,840
He doesn't know how to play anything besides Widow.

1730
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:50,400
He doesn't know anything but Widow.

1731
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:53,220
What kind of fucking hero pool is that?

1732
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:55,520
Frank, listen, listen bro.

1733
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,920
I'll buy you a whole name change for your third sword.

1734
01:24:58,780 --> 01:25:00,400
I feel like you're lying to me.

1735
01:25:00,980 --> 01:25:02,520
Bro, send me your cash after the ride.

1736
01:25:03,180 --> 01:25:04,620
I only take Apple Pay.

1737
01:25:04,860 --> 01:25:05,440
Can I get your number?

1738
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:06,940
Yeah, bro.

1739
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:09,560
Is that Riz?

1740
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:10,660
You see what I did there?

1741
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:11,400
Yeah, yeah.

1742
01:25:13,220 --> 01:25:14,660
This is funny.

1743
01:25:15,180 --> 01:25:15,640
Sure is.

1744
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:19,280
You wanna be my...

1745
01:25:20,090 --> 01:25:20,460
Groomy.

1746
01:25:21,910 --> 01:25:22,280
What?

1747
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:24,380
What?

1748
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:27,080
I wish you would do me.

1749
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:29,380
Wait, that's Riz.

1750
01:25:29,540 --> 01:25:30,660
That's Riz, chat.

1751
01:25:31,540 --> 01:25:32,700
That's Riz.

1752
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:35,340
Yo, chat, is that Riz?

1753
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:36,300
Yo, chat.

1754
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:38,520
Who is he talking to?

1755
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:40,660
Who is he talking to?

1756
01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:43,020
No way.

1757
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:47,060
I don't even know who he's trying to talk to.

1758
01:25:51,740 --> 01:25:54,900
Wait, he never even...

1759
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:56,400
Why did he not go third support?!

1760
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:57,460
He was willing to pay him!

1761
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:59,320
He was gonna give him money!

1762
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:08,340
He was actually willing to pay him money to play third support.

1763
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:10,540
I don't understand.

1764
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:16,520
Actually, easiest fucking money of his life.

1765
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:18,940
Are you not like money?

1766
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:23,440
What are we doing to this Bucky right now?

1767
01:26:30,260 --> 01:26:31,380
Who's gonna know?

1768
01:26:31,820 --> 01:26:32,940
Who's gonna fucking know?

1769
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:37,140
I'm not the one that's paying him!

1770
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:39,820
We were just bystanders.

1771
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:44,760
Being a bystander is not a bannable offense, guys.

1772
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:48,680
Wait, we got the touch.

1773
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:49,780
That's sad.

1774
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:52,220
We got the cap already.

1775
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:55,220
Yeah, we already got the cap.

1776
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:55,720
What the fuck?

1777
01:26:59,540 --> 01:27:01,140
We're taking some money.

1778
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:02,220
Who's gonna know?

1779
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:04,500
Who's gonna fucking know?

1780
01:27:05,940 --> 01:27:08,920
Marvel isn't even sponsoring me so I don't think they're watching anyway.

1781
01:27:11,820 --> 01:27:12,880
Take the money.

1782
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:14,600
Oh, the...

1783
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:24,500
All I'm saying is if I'm not being sponsored by Marvel Rivals I don't think they know I exist!

1784
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:25,780
So who's gonna know?

1785
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:28,640
Are we gonna get snitches?

1786
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:30,460
You guys ain't know snitches, right?

1787
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:35,380
They know.

1788
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:36,680
They don't know.

1789
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:38,920
They don't fucking know.

1790
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:42,020
This guy needs to play.

1791
01:27:42,580 --> 01:27:44,340
This guy needs to fucking play.

1792
01:27:45,780 --> 01:27:47,220
Oh my god.

1793
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:48,220
They're gonna storm ult.

1794
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:50,820
Oh wait, we killed him.

1795
01:27:51,460 --> 01:27:51,760
Nice.

1796
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:52,300
Okay.

1797
01:27:54,580 --> 01:27:57,220
Okay, that was a little too early.

1798
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:02,680
Okay, that's a little too early.

1799
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:04,040
That was a little embarrassing.

1800
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:07,180
He counted wrong.

1801
01:28:07,180 --> 01:28:10,800
It's 12 seconds of you can't do anything.

1802
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:12,160
Not fucking 8.

1803
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:13,820
You miscounted.

1804
01:28:15,660 --> 01:28:17,540
It's 12 seconds.

1805
01:28:18,700 --> 01:28:19,520
What rank is this?

1806
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:20,640
Top 100.

1807
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:26,420
Cause I'm like, I'm rank 100 and I'm rank 175 right now.

1808
01:28:27,340 --> 01:28:29,400
12 seconds of not having fun.

1809
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:30,580
Yeah, he counted too fast.

1810
01:28:33,140 --> 01:28:35,040
I think I'm rank 100 and something.

1811
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:35,840
120 something?

1812
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:36,920
I don't remember.

1813
01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:40,280
I gave him $5 in gold!

1814
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:43,560
Oh shit.

1815
01:28:44,220 --> 01:28:45,260
What the fuck?

1816
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:50,900
No, you gave him $5 to fucking play triple support.

1817
01:28:51,020 --> 01:28:51,800
That's different.

1818
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:53,680
That's so different.

1819
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:56,740
Someone finally killed the Sylas.

1820
01:28:56,940 --> 01:28:57,560
Oh my god.

1821
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,760
Wait a minute.

1822
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:02,700
Throwing?

1823
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:05,060
Dude, we weren't duking it out.

1824
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:05,860
Oh, there he is!

1825
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:07,560
He killed him!

1826
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:08,920
He killed him!

1827
01:29:09,140 --> 01:29:11,520
There he is, playing 3D chess.

1828
01:29:11,620 --> 01:29:12,120
Right there.

1829
01:29:12,260 --> 01:29:14,340
I'm not used to taking damage from a Widow.

1830
01:29:14,820 --> 01:29:15,900
There he is.

1831
01:29:17,140 --> 01:29:19,000
I told you, that's all they do.

1832
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:20,860
That's all they fucking do.

1833
01:29:20,980 --> 01:29:22,420
He just waits.

1834
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:25,000
I'm not gonna let you kill it.

1835
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:26,960
He just fucking waits, I told you.

1836
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:32,080
You had my other team like, my team geeking too.

1837
01:29:32,180 --> 01:29:34,040
They were in the chat like, do you know who this guy is?

1838
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:34,740
And I was like, no.

1839
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:37,100
Do you know who he is?

1840
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:40,220
Does he stream?

1841
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:41,500
Because I'm only afraid of streamers.

1842
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:44,380
I'm only afraid of streamers.

1843
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:48,340
Oh my god.

1844
01:29:49,820 --> 01:29:50,860
Does he stream?

1845
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,020
I'm only afraid of streamers.

1846
01:29:53,020 --> 01:29:56,160
There's fucking streamers that are bad at this game.

1847
01:29:57,260 --> 01:29:58,780
Oh, and you're afraid of Storm.

1848
01:29:59,860 --> 01:30:01,340
Wow, I'm so scared.

1849
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:07,600
There might be someone you'd be afraid of in this lobby right now.

1850
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:10,800
Like who?

1851
01:30:12,620 --> 01:30:14,680
I don't know.

1852
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:23,060
I'm sorry, he's right.

1853
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:27,360
He can't be afraid of me when I just missed like fucking three shots there.

1854
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:28,840
He's so right.

1855
01:30:33,980 --> 01:30:35,380
Okay,

1856
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:39,860
I can't.

1857
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:46,340
Yeah, goodbye.

1858
01:30:47,980 --> 01:30:49,940
Goodbye, I live though.

1859
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:51,160
I live.

1860
01:30:52,360 --> 01:31:02,460
I mean, we can literally avoid him because he literally said he's a widow and he's a widow punisher one trick.

1861
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:06,680
Like, good enough for me.

1862
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:13,000
Like, thanks for exposing yourself there.

1863
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:18,000
Oh my god, he's so low.

1864
01:31:18,220 --> 01:31:19,260
I'm a little scared.

1865
01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:20,260
Oh, he's fine.

1866
01:31:20,340 --> 01:31:22,220
I forgot I have a snowflake on him.

1867
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:23,720
He's so healthy.

1868
01:31:26,180 --> 01:31:28,060
I hope that... do we have to disappear?

1869
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:29,160
We don't.

1870
01:31:29,940 --> 01:31:31,300
Okay, this is a little bad.

1871
01:31:32,940 --> 01:31:34,760
Yeah, no, this is not a fight.

1872
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:38,380
I'm not gonna...

1873
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:42,080
What's he gonna say to Frank?

1874
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:43,960
What's he gonna say?

1875
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:48,220
He wanted to say something to Frank.

1876
01:31:48,820 --> 01:31:52,740
I did ult there because we already lost two people, so there was no reason to ult there.

1877
01:31:52,740 --> 01:31:55,280
I have my ult now.

1878
01:31:55,480 --> 01:31:56,300
There we go.

1879
01:31:56,380 --> 01:31:56,980
Go, Frank!

1880
01:31:57,140 --> 01:31:57,420
Go!

1881
01:31:57,620 --> 01:31:58,200
Do something!

1882
01:32:02,020 --> 01:32:03,480
Do something, Frank!

1883
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:06,880
Kill her.

1884
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:09,380
Kill her!

1885
01:32:11,160 --> 01:32:12,380
Oh, okay.

1886
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:13,860
Alright, that's fine.

1887
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:15,880
That's... I saved her!

1888
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:16,500
I saved her!

1889
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:17,500
I saved her!

1890
01:32:17,660 --> 01:32:18,420
I saved her!

1891
01:32:18,940 --> 01:32:20,180
Okay, we might be dead though.

1892
01:32:20,420 --> 01:32:21,200
We might be dead.

1893
01:32:22,060 --> 01:32:22,720
She's waiting.

1894
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:23,380
She's waiting.

1895
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:24,920
We might be so fucking dead.

1896
01:32:25,260 --> 01:32:27,760
We might be dead.

1897
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:31,740
But we would have lost invisible girl ult, guys.

1898
01:32:31,980 --> 01:32:33,860
All I'm saying, we would have lost that ult.

1899
01:32:34,680 --> 01:32:35,540
I did it, guys.

1900
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:36,300
I'm a hero.

1901
01:32:41,540 --> 01:32:44,140
I'm a fucking... Oh, Frank is on triple support.

1902
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:45,820
He's on... That's right.

1903
01:32:45,900 --> 01:32:46,720
Know your place, Frank.

1904
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:48,560
Know your place.

1905
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:51,940
Alright, that's fine.

1906
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:53,580
Alright.

1907
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:56,400
I'm gonna let invisible girl ult first.

1908
01:32:56,540 --> 01:32:57,340
I feel like...

1909
01:32:57,860 --> 01:33:00,880
I feel like he's a reactionary ult here.

1910
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:09,600
Yeah, I'm gonna let invisible girl ult first because of it.

1911
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:12,400
That's fine.

1912
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:19,260
Everything will be not the best, but like it will be okay.

1913
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:20,940
It's fine, Frank.

1914
01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:23,360
You can learn how to play Adam, I believe.

1915
01:33:25,780 --> 01:33:26,200
Okay.

1916
01:33:29,900 --> 01:33:30,600
That's fine.

1917
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:34,140
We're gonna put on a...

1918
01:33:34,740 --> 01:33:35,080
No.

1919
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:35,680
No.

1920
01:33:36,140 --> 01:33:37,120
Oh my god.

1921
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:38,880
I'm alive.

1922
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:41,720
I... He didn't count.

1923
01:33:41,980 --> 01:33:43,040
He didn't count again.

1924
01:33:43,380 --> 01:33:44,700
He didn't fucking count.

1925
01:33:46,420 --> 01:33:46,800
Okay.

1926
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:47,780
Please.

1927
01:33:47,780 --> 01:33:49,460
We have... No!

1928
01:33:49,640 --> 01:33:50,240
He did it!

1929
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:53,520
He did it.

1930
01:33:54,220 --> 01:33:56,280
He didn't get invisible girl.

1931
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:58,180
That's okay.

1932
01:33:58,660 --> 01:34:00,180
We have a portal.

1933
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:04,780
Oh my god.

1934
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:06,120
No.

1935
01:34:06,620 --> 01:34:07,080
No.

1936
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:08,640
Well,

1937
01:34:13,940 --> 01:34:15,700
I do, but I'm better at Psylocke.

1938
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:17,060
I know how to play Storm.

1939
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:18,560
Okay.

1940
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:23,440
Who's gonna play Storm?

1941
01:34:26,300 --> 01:34:27,480
I don't know.

1942
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:28,660
I don't know what she was...

1943
01:34:28,660 --> 01:34:30,960
I think our Sue was not having a great time.

1944
01:34:31,580 --> 01:34:34,960
I know how to kill her.

1945
01:34:36,180 --> 01:34:37,420
You better not.

1946
01:34:41,780 --> 01:34:42,420
Whoa.

1947
01:34:43,120 --> 01:34:43,820
Whoa.

1948
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:48,320
Whoa.

1949
01:34:49,420 --> 01:34:50,820
Whoa.

1950
01:34:53,540 --> 01:34:54,940
Whoa.

1951
01:34:57,500 --> 01:34:58,140
Whoa.

1952
01:34:58,140 --> 01:35:01,940
Why don't you go invisible woman and I go whatever one of you swap off to?

1953
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:05,340
I don't think we... We don't really need the invisible woman.

1954
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:06,280
No, I don't think so.

1955
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:08,420
Do you want a solo tank?

1956
01:35:09,220 --> 01:35:10,460
Yeah, we can solo tank it.

1957
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:11,880
Yeah, we can solo tank it.

1958
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:15,940
You better swap out right now.

1959
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:20,420
Rowan is like, you better swap right now.

1960
01:35:20,540 --> 01:35:22,160
I'm like, oh my gosh, whoa.

1961
01:35:25,580 --> 01:35:26,740
Oh, oh, we had two.

1962
01:35:26,860 --> 01:35:27,080
I didn't see that.

1963
01:35:28,140 --> 01:35:29,920
Oh my god, okay.

1964
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:34,000
We don't need a tank, guys.

1965
01:35:35,260 --> 01:35:36,360
We don't need a tank.

1966
01:35:40,970 --> 01:35:42,310
Everything will be okay.

1967
01:35:42,430 --> 01:35:43,010
I need to reload.

1968
01:35:45,910 --> 01:35:46,850
He's gonna try again.

1969
01:35:47,470 --> 01:35:48,750
It's gonna work this time, guys.

1970
01:35:48,790 --> 01:35:49,410
You don't understand.

1971
01:35:51,590 --> 01:35:53,710
I was watching...

1972
01:35:54,690 --> 01:35:55,270
I...

1973
01:35:57,970 --> 01:36:00,890
I think they're gonna yell at Frank again, guys.

1974
01:36:01,010 --> 01:36:01,430
I think.

1975
01:36:02,250 --> 01:36:03,590
I don't think...

1976
01:36:03,590 --> 01:36:06,850
I don't think Frank is gonna...

1977
01:36:06,850 --> 01:36:08,250
What happened to our stream?

1978
01:36:08,590 --> 01:36:10,430
How did he get there?

1979
01:36:13,630 --> 01:36:15,950
How did our stream get there?

1980
01:36:17,430 --> 01:36:18,590
Oh my god.

1981
01:36:20,390 --> 01:36:24,430
How did I bump into two, one, three, one tricks in a row?

1982
01:36:25,810 --> 01:36:27,070
That's actually crazy.

1983
01:36:28,010 --> 01:36:29,290
Like, what are the odds?

1984
01:36:30,830 --> 01:36:33,430
That like, high elo is very limited.

1985
01:36:33,970 --> 01:36:37,690
So like, it's crazy that I'm able to bump into three, one tricks in a row.

1986
01:36:38,810 --> 01:36:39,290
What?

1987
01:36:44,190 --> 01:36:44,530
Why?

1988
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:50,820
I missed, I missed, but that's okay.

1989
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:52,140
We'll babysit each other, right?

1990
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:54,220
We're gonna babysit each other.

1991
01:36:56,580 --> 01:36:58,660
We are gonna babysit each other.

1992
01:36:58,760 --> 01:37:00,040
I'm missing my freezes, though.

1993
01:37:00,060 --> 01:37:00,680
It's not good.

1994
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:03,600
Today's not a freeze day.

1995
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:09,880
I think it's also because I played Cloak & Dagger four games in a row, and I'm not like, locked in on Luna right now.

1996
01:37:16,380 --> 01:37:17,680
What did they say?

1997
01:37:17,680 --> 01:37:19,040
Excuse me?

1998
01:37:22,380 --> 01:37:24,280
Let's do Invisible in Reverse, then.

1999
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:25,240
Okay.

2000
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:27,820
Okay, I'll use it.

2001
01:37:28,680 --> 01:37:30,680
Okay, okay.

2002
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:31,980
Um...

2003
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:39,480
I didn't think we need to use it for Mr. Fantastic of all people.

2004
01:37:39,960 --> 01:37:41,960
Like, oh no.

2005
01:37:42,180 --> 01:37:43,720
Maybe I do now.

2006
01:37:44,140 --> 01:37:46,740
Maybe, oh no.

2007
01:37:48,420 --> 01:37:48,900
Okay.

2008
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:50,400
Alright.

2009
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:54,720
Okay.

2010
01:37:57,780 --> 01:37:58,260
Okay.

2011
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:17,020
I was gonna say, I was gonna say, I did not think we need to use Invisible for Mr. Fantastic, and I had to use mine because I was not being kept alive there.

2012
01:38:17,820 --> 01:38:19,600
I was like, I was gonna die.

2013
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:23,060
But then everybody was so far away from me.

2014
01:38:23,140 --> 01:38:24,660
I thought people were gonna walk forward.

2015
01:38:26,860 --> 01:38:29,980
I was like, guys, I have...

2016
01:38:29,980 --> 01:38:32,140
Okay, Storm is gonna kill us.

2017
01:38:32,540 --> 01:38:35,600
She's gonna murder all three of us.

2018
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:37,460
I can feel it.

2019
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:40,180
This is where we die.

2020
01:38:41,460 --> 01:38:43,100
One of us will live.

2021
01:38:43,100 --> 01:38:43,840
It's not me.

2022
01:38:44,740 --> 01:38:46,420
Oh, thank god.

2023
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:48,260
Thank god.

2024
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:50,560
Oh my god, thank god.

2025
01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:54,940
I thought it wasn't me.

2026
01:38:55,300 --> 01:38:56,260
But I was wrong.

2027
01:38:57,100 --> 01:38:58,020
It was me.

2028
01:38:58,800 --> 01:38:59,680
I get to live.

2029
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:01,900
I get to...

2030
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:03,920
Guys, on the cart.

2031
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:07,640
Your position is garbage!

2032
01:39:07,640 --> 01:39:07,820
You're garbage!

2033
01:39:08,220 --> 01:39:13,280
You're supposed to be in the air!

2034
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:14,940
You're Starlord!

2035
01:39:27,670 --> 01:39:28,590
Holy shit!

2036
01:39:28,630 --> 01:39:29,690
He has 14 deaths!

2037
01:39:29,970 --> 01:39:30,930
He can't say that!

2038
01:39:31,810 --> 01:39:32,990
Oh my god.

2039
01:39:35,330 --> 01:39:36,330
I'm going Storm.

2040
01:39:38,150 --> 01:39:39,170
You want Starlord?

2041
01:39:39,950 --> 01:39:41,190
No, not at all.

2042
01:39:41,390 --> 01:39:42,570
Starlord's fucking useless as fuck.

2043
01:39:43,630 --> 01:39:46,050
Starlord is useless to that.

2044
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:54,140
Oh my god.

2045
01:39:54,440 --> 01:39:56,000
A name change won't fix you.

2046
01:39:56,420 --> 01:40:00,340
A name change won't fucking fix you if this is your hero pool.

2047
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:09,400
He cannot be like, how am I dying when I'm next to the healers.

2048
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:10,920
That's crazy.

2049
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,940
That's a crazy statement.

2050
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:22,480
Oh my.

2051
01:40:23,620 --> 01:40:23,940
Okay.

2052
01:40:24,500 --> 01:40:25,020
It's fine.

2053
01:40:28,040 --> 01:40:30,220
Okay, I'm going to put it on our Storm now.

2054
01:40:30,220 --> 01:40:34,180
Because our Storm matters more.

2055
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:39,260
Oh my god.

2056
01:40:39,320 --> 01:40:41,580
Alright, here we go!

2057
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:43,400
Here we go!

2058
01:40:48,240 --> 01:40:51,220
Let's fucking dance!

2059
01:40:51,900 --> 01:40:52,500
Alright, nice.

2060
01:40:54,940 --> 01:40:56,300
We're okay.

2061
01:40:58,400 --> 01:40:59,180
We're okay.

2062
01:40:59,180 --> 01:40:59,300
We're okay.

2063
01:41:00,380 --> 01:41:01,380
It doesn't matter.

2064
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:02,480
You're first.

2065
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:04,200
Oh my god.

2066
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:06,740
It doesn't matter.

2067
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:07,640
We're okay.

2068
01:41:09,100 --> 01:41:11,660
Alright, where is it gonna be?

2069
01:41:12,380 --> 01:41:12,760
Woah!

2070
01:41:13,740 --> 01:41:15,460
I feel so safe now.

2071
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:17,800
Oh my god, we finally did it, guys.

2072
01:41:17,980 --> 01:41:19,600
We coordinated ults, guys.

2073
01:41:19,700 --> 01:41:21,120
I'm so proud of us.

2074
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:22,680
I'm actually...

2075
01:41:22,680 --> 01:41:23,980
I'm so...

2076
01:41:23,980 --> 01:41:25,820
We fucking did it.

2077
01:41:26,380 --> 01:41:26,940
Kill her!

2078
01:41:28,340 --> 01:41:29,160
Oh my god.

2079
01:41:31,320 --> 01:41:32,020
Please.

2080
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:34,260
Please get me in here.

2081
01:41:34,540 --> 01:41:36,080
Please get me into the happy juice.

2082
01:41:36,420 --> 01:41:36,620
Please.

2083
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:40,120
The safe juice.

2084
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:40,880
Please.

2085
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:42,480
Let me be safe.

2086
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:45,980
Okay.

2087
01:41:47,460 --> 01:41:48,260
That's fine.

2088
01:41:53,420 --> 01:41:55,500
Oh no, not Mr. Fantastico.

2089
01:41:55,580 --> 01:41:56,400
Oh no.

2090
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:59,440
I'm gonna say that and then we're gonna fucking die to it.

2091
01:41:59,580 --> 01:42:00,040
Know what I mean?

2092
01:42:01,340 --> 01:42:01,980
You want me to go now?

2093
01:42:02,380 --> 01:42:03,560
Oh, there it is.

2094
01:42:04,980 --> 01:42:05,420
Ha ha!

2095
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:06,140
Ha!

2096
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:07,580
Ha ha!

2097
01:42:08,460 --> 01:42:09,900
That ult is so worthless.

2098
01:42:12,160 --> 01:42:13,200
I think he's gonna charge up.

2099
01:42:14,580 --> 01:42:15,240
Ha ha!

2100
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:16,520
Ha!

2101
01:42:18,040 --> 01:42:18,600
Yeah, yeah.

2102
01:42:18,660 --> 01:42:19,340
You might not need it.

2103
01:42:19,340 --> 01:42:27,160
I swear, this has to be the most grounded um, the most grounded Starlord I've ever seen.

2104
01:42:27,560 --> 01:42:31,960
I don't think I've ever seen a Starlord that has not fucking moved.

2105
01:42:32,660 --> 01:42:32,940
Ha ha!

2106
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:39,520
Oh my god.

2107
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:41,740
Fucking predicted bitch!

2108
01:42:41,780 --> 01:42:42,760
Oh, he's still gonna die.

2109
01:42:43,020 --> 01:42:44,340
He's still gonna die.

2110
01:42:44,360 --> 01:42:45,120
I'm sorry.

2111
01:42:45,680 --> 01:42:46,140
Ha ha!

2112
01:42:46,140 --> 01:42:46,500
Ha ha!

2113
01:42:48,260 --> 01:42:50,000
3, 2, 1.

2114
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:50,600
I'm so dead.

2115
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:51,540
I'm so dead.

2116
01:42:51,580 --> 01:42:52,180
He pushed me.

2117
01:42:52,540 --> 01:42:53,140
What do I do?

2118
01:42:53,980 --> 01:42:54,540
Ha ha!

2119
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:56,200
That was a lot.

2120
01:42:56,600 --> 01:42:58,180
Yeah, like, I don't know.

2121
01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:00,120
He was not living that.

2122
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:03,980
He was definitely not living that.

2123
01:43:05,860 --> 01:43:07,000
Are we on point?

2124
01:43:07,580 --> 01:43:08,960
I wonder if we're on point.

2125
01:43:10,920 --> 01:43:11,700
His last fight?

2126
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:12,520
Oh, this is.

2127
01:43:16,720 --> 01:43:17,720
Get him.

2128
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:19,020
Get him!

2129
01:43:20,300 --> 01:43:21,940
Oh, JK.

2130
01:43:30,100 --> 01:43:31,320
Let's go!

2131
01:43:32,820 --> 01:43:33,620
Let's go!

2132
01:43:34,700 --> 01:43:35,700
I'm avoiding this.

2133
01:43:37,180 --> 01:43:37,580
Ha ha!

2134
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:41,720
But I did it, guys.

2135
01:43:41,960 --> 01:43:42,600
Ha ha!

2136
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:47,080
He's.

2137
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:51,140
Did he just say, Hey, I'm him.

2138
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:52,640
Alright, you know.

2139
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:55,040
You know what that means.

2140
01:43:55,380 --> 01:43:59,480
Bro, Goofus has like, I'm him.

2141
01:44:01,340 --> 01:44:02,280
This shit.

2142
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:05,120
Ha ha!

2143
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:09,180
He played it yet.

2144
01:44:09,380 --> 01:44:10,080
MVP.

2145
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:11,360
Ha ha!

2146
01:44:12,180 --> 01:44:13,220
Sure, little bro.

2147
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:13,960
Sure.

2148
01:44:15,820 --> 01:44:17,580
Avoiding the MVP.

2149
01:44:19,260 --> 01:44:19,700
Ha ha!

2150
01:44:22,860 --> 01:44:24,040
Not great at punishing.

2151
01:44:24,140 --> 01:44:24,700
You don't know that.

2152
01:44:24,740 --> 01:44:25,260
We don't know that.

2153
01:44:25,340 --> 01:44:26,500
I've never seen him on Punisher.

2154
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:31,680
Triple support.

2155
01:44:31,960 --> 01:44:33,960
Wait, we should.

2156
01:44:34,060 --> 01:44:35,020
I'm gonna avoid the Mr. Fantastic.

2157
01:44:35,720 --> 01:44:36,080
Wait.

2158
01:44:38,860 --> 01:44:42,360
Wait, did you avoid Mr. Fantastic?

2159
01:44:42,780 --> 01:44:43,280
Ha ha!

2160
01:44:43,860 --> 01:44:46,640
That guy's an ELO terrorist.

2161
01:44:47,420 --> 01:44:48,980
Whichever one it is.

2162
01:44:49,540 --> 01:44:51,340
I don't remember which one.

2163
01:44:52,440 --> 01:44:54,260
He gave you an upvote.

2164
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:55,360
And you know what?

2165
01:44:55,420 --> 01:44:57,000
I deserve another upvote too.

2166
01:44:58,160 --> 01:44:59,140
Was it buttcrunch?

2167
01:44:59,480 --> 01:44:59,660
Ha ha!

2168
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:03,260
That's right.

2169
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:04,320
Tough love.

2170
01:45:06,240 --> 01:45:08,140
It's fucking tough love right there.

2171
01:45:09,480 --> 01:45:10,480
Um...

2172
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:12,540
It was...

2173
01:45:12,540 --> 01:45:12,680
What?

2174
01:45:13,980 --> 01:45:14,080
What?

2175
01:45:14,940 --> 01:45:17,160
Is butt censored?

2176
01:45:18,460 --> 01:45:19,460
But...

2177
01:45:19,460 --> 01:45:20,040
No.

2178
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:22,420
Buttcruncher.

2179
01:45:22,840 --> 01:45:24,200
No, no it's not.

2180
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:24,920
Ha ha!

2181
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:31,620
Oh, I said muncher.

2182
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:33,620
Butt muncher?

2183
01:45:33,940 --> 01:45:34,820
Ha ha!

2184
01:45:34,820 --> 01:45:36,320
Wait.

2185
01:45:40,120 --> 01:45:40,660
Munch.

2186
01:45:42,220 --> 01:45:42,760
No!

2187
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:44,160
Wait.

2188
01:45:45,420 --> 01:45:47,740
Butt munch is censored.

2189
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:49,520
Wait.

2190
01:45:49,660 --> 01:45:53,320
If you put butt and munch together, it's censored.

2191
01:45:54,240 --> 01:45:55,460
Butt munch.

2192
01:45:57,240 --> 01:45:57,660
Ha ha!

2193
01:45:59,080 --> 01:46:00,880
Bro, you can't eat ass.

2194
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:03,800
Eat ass.

2195
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:05,300
You can't...

2196
01:46:05,300 --> 01:46:07,200
You can't say anything about eating ass.

2197
01:46:09,820 --> 01:46:10,240
Wait.

2198
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:14,120
You are not allowed to munch any butts here.

2199
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:15,260
Ha ha!

2200
01:46:15,380 --> 01:46:17,600
Bro, you can't.

2201
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,320
Why, Liv?

2202
01:46:19,680 --> 01:46:20,300
Ha ha!

2203
01:46:21,100 --> 01:46:22,680
Ha ha!

2204
01:46:23,740 --> 01:46:26,240
Why the fuck is that the case?

2205
01:46:27,060 --> 01:46:27,480
Guys.

2206
01:46:28,240 --> 01:46:30,400
Munching butts is not allowed here.

2207
01:46:30,660 --> 01:46:31,200
In Marvel.

2208
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:32,780
That's not fair.

2209
01:46:32,780 --> 01:46:36,520
Why give them all this cake if we can't munch it?

2210
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:38,320
What's the point?

2211
01:46:39,120 --> 01:46:40,880
I might as well die.

2212
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:41,280
Ha ha!

2213
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:44,440
Like...

2214
01:46:44,440 --> 01:46:46,520
He's right there.

2215
01:46:47,160 --> 01:46:48,780
This is unplayable.

2216
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:50,520
Ha ha!

2217
01:46:51,580 --> 01:46:53,640
I don't understand.

2218
01:46:55,120 --> 01:46:59,020
They give them all this ass, but you can't munch.

2219
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:00,600
Ha ha!

2220
01:47:02,940 --> 01:47:04,780
Cruel and unusual punishment.

2221
01:47:05,860 --> 01:47:07,300
Can't even eat this.

2222
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:08,800
19 inches.

2223
01:47:10,300 --> 01:47:11,260
Ha ha!

2224
01:47:14,140 --> 01:47:15,480
I can't believe it.

2225
01:47:15,540 --> 01:47:18,400
I discovered a new censorship.

2226
01:47:18,780 --> 01:47:21,540
But you can name yourself Butt Muncher?

2227
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:25,040
Why can't you name yourself Butt Muncher?

2228
01:47:25,540 --> 01:47:26,820
Oh, I'm age 3, by the way.

2229
01:47:27,020 --> 01:47:30,460
You can name yourself Butt Muncher, but you can't munch butt.

2230
01:47:30,460 --> 01:47:31,560
That's crazy.

2231
01:47:31,720 --> 01:47:32,900
That's actually crazy.

2232
01:47:34,760 --> 01:47:36,820
Oh, because he's Butt Cruncher!

2233
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:37,460
Oh, never mind.

2234
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:38,820
His name was Butt Cruncher.

2235
01:47:39,180 --> 01:47:39,940
Never mind.

2236
01:47:41,540 --> 01:47:42,960
I guess it's sort of...

2237
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:45,880
No, he was Butt Cruncher.

2238
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:50,480
Sorry, I thought his name was Butt Muncher.

2239
01:47:51,300 --> 01:47:53,320
The crunch is better than the munch.

2240
01:47:53,440 --> 01:47:54,060
That's true.

2241
01:47:55,320 --> 01:47:59,060
My mods make a command saying my rank, just be like...

2242
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:03,060
If anybody do exclamation point rank, just write...

2243
01:48:04,820 --> 01:48:05,420
write...

2244
01:48:05,420 --> 01:48:06,340
She peaked...

2245
01:48:06,340 --> 01:48:08,160
She peaked rank 29.

2246
01:48:09,660 --> 01:48:13,680
She peaked rank 29 and ended top 500 in season 0.

2247
01:48:14,080 --> 01:48:14,820
There you go.

2248
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:16,340
I don't want to do it myself.

2249
01:48:16,700 --> 01:48:17,620
That's true.

2250
01:48:17,880 --> 01:48:18,900
That's another good question.

2251
01:48:19,140 --> 01:48:20,180
Are any mods around?

2252
01:48:20,700 --> 01:48:21,120
Ha ha ha!

2253
01:48:24,040 --> 01:48:24,820
That's true.

2254
01:48:24,820 --> 01:48:26,720
That's another concern we have.

2255
01:48:26,820 --> 01:48:29,260
Do we have any mods around?

2256
01:48:29,380 --> 01:48:30,940
Oh my god, do I have to do my own work?

2257
01:48:31,300 --> 01:48:32,480
Oh my god.

2258
01:48:32,720 --> 01:48:34,020
I can't believe it.

2259
01:48:34,060 --> 01:48:35,400
I have to do my own job.

2260
01:48:36,140 --> 01:48:37,340
What's the point?

2261
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:38,600
Ha ha ha!

2262
01:48:38,780 --> 01:48:39,180
Okay.

2263
01:48:40,220 --> 01:48:40,920
KnightBot.

2264
01:48:42,500 --> 01:48:43,200
Rank.

2265
01:48:43,820 --> 01:48:44,180
Okay.

2266
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:46,360
Exclamation point rank.

2267
01:48:47,820 --> 01:48:53,300
Peaked rank 29 in season 1.

2268
01:48:54,540 --> 01:49:01,940
Ended top 500 in season 0 on support.

2269
01:49:02,720 --> 01:49:04,200
Not a one trick.

2270
01:49:04,620 --> 01:49:05,820
Ha ha ha!

2271
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:08,200
There you go.

2272
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:09,080
There you go.

2273
01:49:10,540 --> 01:49:11,420
Alright.

2274
01:49:12,940 --> 01:49:15,940
The mods left after I censored Raccoon.

2275
01:49:16,220 --> 01:49:16,360
Ha ha ha!

2276
01:49:18,440 --> 01:49:19,940
Alright, there you go.

2277
01:49:20,660 --> 01:49:23,600
I just need people to know I'm not a one trick, guys.

2278
01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:25,380
I just need people to know.

2279
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:30,000
Oh, I should be like ended top 500, 1 above all.

2280
01:49:30,640 --> 01:49:33,340
1 above all in season 0.

2281
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:34,080
There you go.

2282
01:49:37,870 --> 01:49:38,510
There you go.

2283
01:49:38,810 --> 01:49:39,330
I'm not!

2284
01:49:39,930 --> 01:49:42,070
I can play Mantis now.

2285
01:49:42,170 --> 01:49:44,490
I just don't play her because she's not good anymore.

2286
01:49:45,090 --> 01:49:46,130
Thank fucking god.

2287
01:49:46,250 --> 01:49:47,130
I don't want to aim anymore.

2288
01:49:47,410 --> 01:49:48,330
Ha ha ha!

2289
01:49:48,330 --> 01:49:49,850
Ha ha ha!

2290
01:49:50,630 --> 01:49:51,930
Thank fucking god.

2291
01:49:51,990 --> 01:49:53,590
I don't feel like aiming today.

2292
01:49:54,010 --> 01:49:55,450
Ha ha ha!

2293
01:49:56,570 --> 01:49:57,450
Ha ha ha!

2294
01:49:58,050 --> 01:49:58,610
Whoa!

2295
01:50:00,010 --> 01:50:01,190
I love Mantis.

2296
01:50:03,150 --> 01:50:03,830
Um...

2297
01:50:03,830 --> 01:50:05,630
Today, I just don't feel like aiming.

2298
01:50:06,270 --> 01:50:08,390
I mean, aiming on Luna is so...

2299
01:50:08,390 --> 01:50:12,050
I can autopilot aim on Luna because Luna is...

2300
01:50:12,050 --> 01:50:15,510
Um... Luna's aim is hitscan.

2301
01:50:15,510 --> 01:50:18,050
So, it's so easy to autopilot on Luna.

2302
01:50:18,310 --> 01:50:23,550
Also, my tracking got so much worse now because there's no tracking support characters.

2303
01:50:24,110 --> 01:50:25,490
So, my tracking is so...

2304
01:50:25,490 --> 01:50:31,330
I used to be really, really good at tracking but I haven't done it in so long that it's pretty bad now.

2305
01:50:31,950 --> 01:50:36,150
Or like, just not as good as it is like as it was before.

2306
01:50:36,610 --> 01:50:38,570
But my hitscan improved a lot.

2307
01:50:38,750 --> 01:50:40,830
My hitscan improved so much more.

2308
01:50:42,810 --> 01:50:44,650
But Mantis is projectile.

2309
01:50:45,050 --> 01:50:47,470
So, it's so frustrating aiming with...

2310
01:50:47,470 --> 01:50:50,830
It's so frustrating aiming with Mantis and I don't have fun with it.

2311
01:50:51,130 --> 01:50:52,310
Because I like...

2312
01:50:52,310 --> 01:50:54,110
It's just frustrating.

2313
01:50:57,130 --> 01:50:57,730
Um...

2314
01:50:57,730 --> 01:50:59,210
Having nerf support specials?

2315
01:50:59,270 --> 01:51:02,190
No, they're still as overpowered.

2316
01:51:02,610 --> 01:51:03,630
Ha ha ha!

2317
01:51:06,570 --> 01:51:07,690
They're still...

2318
01:51:07,690 --> 01:51:09,290
Support ults are still overpowered.

2319
01:51:09,570 --> 01:51:10,570
Now, they make...

2320
01:51:10,570 --> 01:51:15,630
I think like the Marvel Rivals of balancing... The Marvel Rivals of balancing is so funny.

2321
01:51:16,210 --> 01:51:22,530
They basically do like... If every character is overpowered, then there's no need to balance anyone.

2322
01:51:22,970 --> 01:51:23,410
That's...

2323
01:51:23,410 --> 01:51:26,570
That's their strat when it comes to...

2324
01:51:28,090 --> 01:51:28,770
Um...

2325
01:51:28,770 --> 01:51:32,610
When it comes to how they balance characters... Oh my god!

2326
01:51:32,770 --> 01:51:33,650
That's so smart!

2327
01:51:34,270 --> 01:51:36,050
That's so smart!

2328
01:51:36,670 --> 01:51:38,570
If every character is...

2329
01:51:38,570 --> 01:51:38,950
Yeah!

2330
01:51:40,050 --> 01:51:40,930
Oh boy!

2331
01:51:41,870 --> 01:51:42,570
Ha ha ha!

2332
01:51:43,770 --> 01:51:44,630
Ha ha ha!

2333
01:51:45,710 --> 01:51:47,830
Yeah, so that's really how they do it.

2334
01:51:48,050 --> 01:51:50,190
They literally just make everybody so fucking strong.

2335
01:51:50,330 --> 01:51:51,010
There's like...

2336
01:51:52,570 --> 01:51:55,270
Everybody is so strong, they don't need to balance anything.

2337
01:51:57,350 --> 01:51:58,050
And everyone gets...

2338
01:51:58,050 --> 01:51:58,890
Yeah, everyone gets ult.

2339
01:51:58,910 --> 01:51:59,670
It's so easy.

2340
01:51:59,850 --> 01:52:01,550
People will be like, wow, how did you ult track?

2341
01:52:01,590 --> 01:52:02,370
It's so easy.

2342
01:52:03,290 --> 01:52:04,890
Okay, this is how I think.

2343
01:52:05,750 --> 01:52:09,050
The NMT team's ult comes up every other fight.

2344
01:52:10,350 --> 01:52:13,250
So, usually they get it in the second fight.

2345
01:52:13,470 --> 01:52:14,810
The first fight, they build it up.

2346
01:52:15,050 --> 01:52:19,370
In the second fight, they either get it or they either have the ult or they get the ult.

2347
01:52:19,670 --> 01:52:20,970
And that's how I ult track.

2348
01:52:21,470 --> 01:52:22,550
And then it's just like...

2349
01:52:22,550 --> 01:52:26,230
If I counter ult somebody, if I have a ult, they have it.

2350
01:52:26,330 --> 01:52:35,210
If I'm counter ulting someone, if I defensive ult Storm ult, then if I have my ult again, then Storm has her ult.

2351
01:52:35,490 --> 01:52:37,030
So that's literally how you ult track.

2352
01:52:37,310 --> 01:52:39,710
It's like baby ult tracking.

2353
01:52:43,570 --> 01:52:48,730
Overwatch ult tracking is so much harder because they slow down.

2354
01:52:49,310 --> 01:52:51,230
It's so hard to build ults and everything.

2355
01:52:51,890 --> 01:52:55,230
In Marvel Rivals, everybody's the same.

2356
01:52:55,710 --> 01:52:59,290
The building percentage-wise is almost the same thing.

2357
01:53:00,770 --> 01:53:03,050
Those people were like, oh my god, how do you freaking track everything?

2358
01:53:03,170 --> 01:53:04,870
I'm like, it's so easy.

2359
01:53:07,610 --> 01:53:11,690
It's like baby's first ult tracking experience.

2360
01:53:12,590 --> 01:53:14,190
And that's really how I do it.

2361
01:53:15,310 --> 01:53:17,170
But I usually turn my brain off.

2362
01:53:17,390 --> 01:53:20,930
I mean, I just don't commun- Today, I don't want to talk to my team.

2363
01:53:24,170 --> 01:53:30,830
Usually, I would tell my team, they'll have this next time.

2364
01:53:30,890 --> 01:53:33,710
But today, I'm like, I don't fucking- You guys figure this out.

2365
01:53:33,950 --> 01:53:36,470
As long as I know what I'm ulting for, it's fine.

2366
01:53:40,770 --> 01:53:42,630
I'm like, I don't fucking care.

2367
01:53:42,810 --> 01:53:44,510
You guys do your own ult tracking.

2368
01:53:45,610 --> 01:53:46,910
You're on your own.

2369
01:53:49,970 --> 01:53:52,610
I know what my job is and that's all that matters.

2370
01:53:54,890 --> 01:53:57,090
Are you gonna build Synergy?

2371
01:53:57,450 --> 01:53:59,310
There's no Synergy to build!

2372
01:53:59,750 --> 01:54:00,980
What do you mean?

2373
01:54:02,490 --> 01:54:04,790
Who am I building Synergy for?

2374
01:54:05,030 --> 01:54:05,670
Oh shit.

2375
01:54:06,130 --> 01:54:08,030
Potentially really big game.

2376
01:54:08,110 --> 01:54:09,130
I'm scared.

2377
01:54:11,170 --> 01:54:12,840
What the fuck?

2378
01:54:13,850 --> 01:54:14,750
What?

2379
01:54:19,430 --> 01:54:20,970
Oh my god.

2380
01:54:21,230 --> 01:54:27,030
We're against the World- The champion 3-stack?

2381
01:54:27,270 --> 01:54:29,130
Oh, 3-stack.

2382
01:54:29,270 --> 01:54:32,910
We're against the team that won the Marvel Rivals tournament.

2383
01:54:33,650 --> 01:54:35,230
We're against the controller player too.

2384
01:54:38,870 --> 01:54:42,130
No, it's just a really good- They were just queuing at the same time.

2385
01:54:42,170 --> 01:54:43,990
Their game just ended.

2386
01:54:45,210 --> 01:54:47,010
Ooh, this is gonna be scary.

2387
01:54:47,730 --> 01:54:48,250
Scary.

2388
01:54:48,510 --> 01:54:49,570
I'm gonna get hard targeted.

2389
01:54:49,570 --> 01:54:57,210
I'm gonna- You might not see me alive for most of this game, guys.

2390
01:55:01,690 --> 01:55:03,370
I'm just gonna say.

2391
01:55:03,730 --> 01:55:06,510
You might not see me alive.

2392
01:55:11,290 --> 01:55:12,750
Alright, here we go.

2393
01:55:13,070 --> 01:55:14,350
I have to lock in.

2394
01:55:14,530 --> 01:55:15,810
Do I have to talk?

2395
01:55:17,330 --> 01:55:18,610
No, no.

2396
01:55:19,090 --> 01:55:22,870
I have to- Talk to people.

2397
01:55:26,350 --> 01:55:27,710
I believe.

2398
01:55:28,210 --> 01:55:28,990
Me too.

2399
01:55:29,590 --> 01:55:30,770
I believe too.

2400
01:55:32,050 --> 01:55:33,450
Alright, here we go.

2401
01:55:37,700 --> 01:55:39,340
Who is not loaded in?

2402
01:55:39,400 --> 01:55:40,000
Who is it?

2403
01:55:40,040 --> 01:55:40,860
Okay, it's Wicked.

2404
01:55:41,600 --> 01:55:43,200
Because I'm 100% loaded.

2405
01:55:45,260 --> 01:55:45,740
Okay.

2406
01:55:45,740 --> 01:55:47,940
That's so- Talking to people.

2407
01:55:48,840 --> 01:55:49,580
You're right.

2408
01:55:49,820 --> 01:55:51,020
I'm a lesbian.

2409
01:55:52,860 --> 01:55:53,320
Alright.

2410
01:55:53,920 --> 01:55:58,720
Oh my god, I'm a lesbian on the fucking- Hero of Black Panther?

2411
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:00,300
Alright, I believe now.

2412
01:56:00,560 --> 01:56:02,420
Wait, do we have- No, we don't.

2413
01:56:02,460 --> 01:56:03,500
We don't have a support player.

2414
01:56:03,800 --> 01:56:05,220
Okay, this is a little awkward.

2415
01:56:08,420 --> 01:56:09,320
It's only me.

2416
01:56:09,320 --> 01:56:10,960
I'm the only support player.

2417
01:56:11,220 --> 01:56:12,460
Who do we ban?

2418
01:56:13,860 --> 01:56:14,700
Hey guys.

2419
01:56:15,340 --> 01:56:17,420
Ah, nobody wants- Okay, Bruce Banner.

2420
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:18,360
That's fine.

2421
01:56:22,830 --> 01:56:26,730
I'll only believe in Wakanda if this guy changes my worldview.

2422
01:56:27,310 --> 01:56:29,190
And kills like everybody.

2423
01:56:35,550 --> 01:56:38,310
He's not real until he changes my worldview.

2424
01:56:39,050 --> 01:56:41,710
So it's not happening.

2425
01:56:42,310 --> 01:56:45,010
Guys, you're supposed to believe in my team.

2426
01:56:45,530 --> 01:56:47,190
I thought you guys loved Wakanda.

2427
01:56:48,570 --> 01:56:50,930
I didn't like Wakanda no more.

2428
01:56:51,210 --> 01:56:53,350
I thought you guys were gonna believe.

2429
01:56:54,810 --> 01:56:57,330
Oh, now you don't believe in my team.

2430
01:56:57,630 --> 01:56:59,330
Now you don't believe in Panther.

2431
01:56:59,750 --> 01:57:01,670
Oh, you're gonna ditch Wakanda now?

2432
01:57:02,510 --> 01:57:03,190
After all that?

2433
01:57:04,570 --> 01:57:06,010
I'm chill with healing.

2434
01:57:06,010 --> 01:57:07,590
It's okay, it's okay.

2435
01:57:07,670 --> 01:57:08,190
You got it.

2436
01:57:08,230 --> 01:57:10,010
I'll play some Chatham.

2437
01:57:12,270 --> 01:57:13,890
Wakanda and Zelda.

2438
01:57:15,250 --> 01:57:15,810
Dirty, dirty.

2439
01:57:16,510 --> 01:57:18,670
Alright, let's see how this goes.

2440
01:57:19,750 --> 01:57:23,630
I love how- I love how it's like Guru TTV.

2441
01:57:25,430 --> 01:57:29,050
Subtle advertisement right there.

2442
01:57:33,610 --> 01:57:35,770
It's so fucking tiny.

2443
01:57:37,090 --> 01:57:38,090
Very subtle.

2444
01:57:41,090 --> 01:57:42,510
I'm liking this.

2445
01:57:42,890 --> 01:57:43,810
Alright, here we go.

2446
01:57:45,330 --> 01:57:46,670
What's the worst that could happen?

2447
01:57:46,850 --> 01:57:47,490
Oh my god.

2448
01:57:48,760 --> 01:57:52,070
Guys, if I- if I die, please remember me.

2449
01:57:54,550 --> 01:57:55,170
Alright.

2450
01:57:56,450 --> 01:58:03,090
By the way, apparently I found out, the person that made the video about the Luna tech and saying how there's more burst healing, lied.

2451
01:58:05,410 --> 01:58:13,330
I knew it was bullshit, but like, I didn't realize it was- it doesn't actually give burst healing.

2452
01:58:13,630 --> 01:58:16,550
Like, I was talking to the pro players and they're like, no, that's not real.

2453
01:58:19,030 --> 01:58:22,050
It apparently doesn't actually give burst healing.

2454
01:58:22,490 --> 01:58:25,050
So people did that just to kill their team.

2455
01:58:25,370 --> 01:58:26,770
It's actually crazy.

2456
01:58:26,910 --> 01:58:27,490
You're walled off.

2457
01:58:29,330 --> 01:58:30,210
Oh no.

2458
01:58:30,630 --> 01:58:31,190
Oh no.

2459
01:58:32,070 --> 01:58:36,010
You just do that, you die on the internet just like that.

2460
01:58:36,170 --> 01:58:36,430
Yep.

2461
01:58:37,790 --> 01:58:38,370
Impossible.

2462
01:58:39,350 --> 01:58:40,770
There's no reason.

2463
01:58:42,910 --> 01:58:44,150
Oh no, I have to reload.

2464
01:58:44,690 --> 01:58:46,370
I have to reload my hands.

2465
01:58:46,550 --> 01:58:46,770
Please.

2466
01:58:47,050 --> 01:58:48,050
Please, guys.

2467
01:58:48,490 --> 01:58:49,330
Do not die.

2468
01:58:49,410 --> 01:58:51,010
My hands need to be reloaded.

2469
01:58:53,170 --> 01:58:57,330
I swear to god, this Black Panther is getting so babysat.

2470
01:58:57,670 --> 01:58:59,950
There's no way you can die.

2471
01:59:00,170 --> 01:59:04,830
If you die after everything I'm doing to you, like, there's no way.

2472
01:59:06,390 --> 01:59:07,850
Oh my god, please, please, please.

2473
01:59:07,970 --> 01:59:08,690
Oh my god, thank you.

2474
01:59:10,890 --> 01:59:11,590
Oh, sorry.

2475
01:59:12,430 --> 01:59:12,950
Fear.

2476
01:59:16,810 --> 01:59:18,030
Oh, fear.

2477
01:59:19,590 --> 01:59:20,770
I can't, he used it.

2478
01:59:20,770 --> 01:59:21,750
Oh, nice.

2479
01:59:22,710 --> 01:59:23,510
Goodbye.

2480
01:59:26,450 --> 01:59:28,170
I have to leave.

2481
01:59:33,010 --> 01:59:35,010
Oh my god.

2482
01:59:37,750 --> 01:59:40,030
Oh my god, please.

2483
01:59:40,430 --> 01:59:41,150
Oh, you're walled off.

2484
01:59:42,070 --> 01:59:45,830
Oh no.

2485
01:59:45,830 --> 01:59:45,950
Oh no.

2486
01:59:48,750 --> 01:59:51,770
Guys, it might be...

2487
01:59:51,770 --> 01:59:52,450
Oh, nice.

2488
01:59:55,410 --> 01:59:56,290
Can you...

2489
01:59:57,430 --> 01:59:59,030
Okay, it's fine, I'll touch it.

2490
01:59:59,510 --> 02:00:01,750
I guess we don't go strange, question mark.

2491
02:00:04,350 --> 02:00:05,090
Oh, hey.

2492
02:00:05,490 --> 02:00:07,390
I don't know if he's gonna live, guys.

2493
02:00:08,870 --> 02:00:09,890
It's okay, Groot.

2494
02:00:09,890 --> 02:00:10,490
Break, break, break.

2495
02:00:11,910 --> 02:00:12,830
It's okay.

2496
02:00:13,390 --> 02:00:14,210
It's okay.

2497
02:00:15,110 --> 02:00:16,030
He's so healthy.

2498
02:00:17,450 --> 02:00:18,830
He's so healthy.

2499
02:00:19,390 --> 02:00:19,970
Change his ult.

2500
02:00:22,430 --> 02:00:24,030
Oh my god.

2501
02:00:24,670 --> 02:00:25,630
He's so healthy.

2502
02:00:26,630 --> 02:00:28,490
He's so fucking healthy.

2503
02:00:31,410 --> 02:00:33,190
There's no way he can die.

2504
02:00:34,310 --> 02:00:35,650
Alright, here you go.

2505
02:00:36,750 --> 02:00:38,110
I don't even know if...

2506
02:00:38,110 --> 02:00:39,730
No, he has two kills.

2507
02:00:40,210 --> 02:00:43,670
At this point, he's living, but I don't...

2508
02:00:43,670 --> 02:00:46,230
At least he's not feeding.

2509
02:00:47,370 --> 02:00:49,030
Like, I don't know.

2510
02:00:50,170 --> 02:00:51,990
He's living, but okay.

2511
02:00:56,130 --> 02:00:56,810
Nevermind.

2512
02:00:57,590 --> 02:00:58,610
Oh, goodbye.

2513
02:01:03,510 --> 02:01:04,910
I'm gonna die here.

2514
02:01:05,430 --> 02:01:06,070
Oh, straight up.

2515
02:01:06,070 --> 02:01:07,110
Double ult.

2516
02:01:09,410 --> 02:01:11,050
I got ult.

2517
02:01:12,130 --> 02:01:12,690
Okay.

2518
02:01:14,750 --> 02:01:15,710
Oh no.

2519
02:01:17,130 --> 02:01:17,510
No.

2520
02:01:17,790 --> 02:01:18,310
It's fine.

2521
02:01:18,470 --> 02:01:19,130
It's fine.

2522
02:01:19,470 --> 02:01:20,350
I should've saved it.

2523
02:01:20,390 --> 02:01:21,610
I should've saved it for the rez.

2524
02:01:21,850 --> 02:01:24,170
I forgot about the Groot moon ult.

2525
02:01:24,530 --> 02:01:25,330
That was my bad.

2526
02:01:25,430 --> 02:01:25,590
Okay.

2527
02:01:25,770 --> 02:01:26,410
Don't ult.

2528
02:01:26,970 --> 02:01:29,950
Do not ult when Groot ults.

2529
02:01:30,070 --> 02:01:30,830
I need to remember that.

2530
02:01:31,370 --> 02:01:35,030
And then save it for the rez beacon.

2531
02:01:35,690 --> 02:01:36,250
Okay.

2532
02:01:36,870 --> 02:01:38,210
I'll do that next time.

2533
02:01:38,330 --> 02:01:38,870
I remembered.

2534
02:01:39,270 --> 02:01:41,250
Now, I've locked it in my head.

2535
02:01:42,030 --> 02:01:45,030
I keep forgetting they have the combo, but now that I...

2536
02:01:46,910 --> 02:01:48,390
Now that I know.

2537
02:01:49,510 --> 02:01:50,910
Now that I know.

2538
02:01:52,290 --> 02:01:53,110
It's fine.

2539
02:01:54,070 --> 02:01:55,190
I figured it out.

2540
02:01:55,970 --> 02:01:57,610
I figured it out, guys.

2541
02:01:57,950 --> 02:01:59,130
It's in my head now.

2542
02:01:59,330 --> 02:02:00,110
I've downloaded it.

2543
02:02:00,770 --> 02:02:02,330
Okay, we gotta make sure...

2544
02:02:02,330 --> 02:02:05,430
I'm not giving the Black Panther.

2545
02:02:07,670 --> 02:02:10,850
I can't give this to the Black Panther anymore.

2546
02:02:11,250 --> 02:02:13,210
He is not picking up his weight.

2547
02:02:13,750 --> 02:02:15,610
He is, actually.

2548
02:02:16,930 --> 02:02:18,050
It's pretty good, though.

2549
02:02:19,050 --> 02:02:21,850
He's not picking up his weight.

2550
02:02:23,090 --> 02:02:25,050
I don't care if he lives longer.

2551
02:02:25,210 --> 02:02:26,410
My tanks need to live.

2552
02:02:29,390 --> 02:02:31,350
My tanks are more important.

2553
02:02:34,790 --> 02:02:35,550
Alright.

2554
02:02:38,470 --> 02:02:40,310
I don't care.

2555
02:02:40,610 --> 02:02:41,610
Groot needs to live more.

2556
02:02:43,430 --> 02:02:43,930
Oh.

2557
02:02:44,190 --> 02:02:44,730
Goodbye.

2558
02:02:48,530 --> 02:02:50,050
I can't.

2559
02:02:50,430 --> 02:02:51,210
There's no point.

2560
02:02:51,310 --> 02:02:52,430
I just waste my ult.

2561
02:02:53,370 --> 02:02:54,810
Wakana is gone.

2562
02:02:55,650 --> 02:02:57,710
Wakana is fucking gone.

2563
02:02:59,010 --> 02:02:59,810
It's over.

2564
02:03:00,090 --> 02:03:00,950
Am I gonna live?

2565
02:03:01,290 --> 02:03:01,790
I am.

2566
02:03:03,230 --> 02:03:03,970
I am.

2567
02:03:04,770 --> 02:03:06,990
Guys, I don't know, but I don't think... Oh, shit.

2568
02:03:07,070 --> 02:03:07,970
I was not paying attention.

2569
02:03:08,450 --> 02:03:10,110
I don't know, but I think, like...

2570
02:03:10,110 --> 02:03:11,130
I don't know.

2571
02:03:11,230 --> 02:03:14,170
Iron Lesbian might not be, like, the best.

2572
02:03:16,250 --> 02:03:17,250
I'm not sure, though.

2573
02:03:17,370 --> 02:03:18,190
I'm not sure, though.

2574
02:03:18,190 --> 02:03:18,990
I might need more data.

2575
02:03:19,990 --> 02:03:22,470
But, like, it's not looking so good for Iron Lesbian.

2576
02:03:22,470 --> 02:03:22,590
Iron Lesbian.

2577
02:03:25,890 --> 02:03:26,990
Oh, you're walled off?

2578
02:03:28,130 --> 02:03:28,810
Oh, man.

2579
02:03:29,010 --> 02:03:29,250
Okay.

2580
02:03:30,110 --> 02:03:30,730
I have combo.

2581
02:03:32,450 --> 02:03:33,770
You can look for...

2582
02:03:33,770 --> 02:03:34,530
Oh, my god.

2583
02:03:34,610 --> 02:03:36,050
I had...

2584
02:03:36,050 --> 02:03:36,210
No!

2585
02:03:38,530 --> 02:03:39,730
I'm waiting on you.

2586
02:03:40,650 --> 02:03:41,470
Oh, my god.

2587
02:03:41,510 --> 02:03:41,930
Please.

2588
02:03:44,430 --> 02:03:45,510
Oh, goodbye.

2589
02:03:45,510 --> 02:03:45,550
Goodbye.

2590
02:03:51,810 --> 02:03:52,870
That's not even enough damage.

2591
02:03:53,110 --> 02:03:53,550
Alright, I give up.

2592
02:04:03,830 --> 02:04:04,270
Alright.

2593
02:04:04,830 --> 02:04:05,170
It's fine.

2594
02:04:05,230 --> 02:04:05,710
We have Rez.

2595
02:04:05,750 --> 02:04:06,250
It's fine.

2596
02:04:06,630 --> 02:04:07,690
It's the worst that could happen.

2597
02:04:07,770 --> 02:04:08,450
We have Rez.

2598
02:04:08,910 --> 02:04:10,470
We have... Oh, okay.

2599
02:04:10,810 --> 02:04:11,250
Alright.

2600
02:04:12,210 --> 02:04:12,650
Okay.

2601
02:04:15,510 --> 02:04:15,730
Okay.

2602
02:04:16,710 --> 02:04:17,810
It's fine.

2603
02:04:19,430 --> 02:04:21,130
We're... Everything is fine.

2604
02:04:22,210 --> 02:04:23,350
Everything is fine.

2605
02:04:24,550 --> 02:04:26,410
Don't give up now!

2606
02:04:27,070 --> 02:04:28,710
What will your TTP say?

2607
02:04:33,210 --> 02:04:35,030
Oh, that's unlucky.

2608
02:04:35,630 --> 02:04:36,990
That's rough, buddy.

2609
02:04:37,670 --> 02:04:38,870
That's so rough.

2610
02:04:39,710 --> 02:04:40,810
Oh, no.

2611
02:04:42,350 --> 02:04:43,090
I don't know.

2612
02:04:43,230 --> 02:04:43,710
I don't...

2613
02:04:43,710 --> 02:04:45,650
I don't believe in our...

2614
02:04:45,650 --> 02:04:47,250
I don't believe in him.

2615
02:04:47,470 --> 02:04:49,690
I don't believe in our lesbian anymore.

2616
02:04:51,690 --> 02:04:52,030
Like...

2617
02:04:52,370 --> 02:04:53,430
I don't know.

2618
02:04:54,150 --> 02:04:54,650
Goodbye.

2619
02:04:56,210 --> 02:04:58,150
I accepted my death.

2620
02:05:01,570 --> 02:05:05,670
Every time I see myself in there, it's... I'm like...

2621
02:05:05,670 --> 02:05:06,270
It's alright.

2622
02:05:07,090 --> 02:05:09,070
It's just how it is.

2623
02:05:09,250 --> 02:05:10,590
It really is.

2624
02:05:16,610 --> 02:05:17,710
Oh, my god.

2625
02:05:17,750 --> 02:05:17,970
Okay.

2626
02:05:18,190 --> 02:05:18,870
Oh, shit.

2627
02:05:19,930 --> 02:05:21,050
I didn't realize.

2628
02:05:21,190 --> 02:05:21,950
I thought it was just me.

2629
02:05:22,570 --> 02:05:23,750
I thought it was just me.

2630
02:05:23,790 --> 02:05:24,630
Oh, it doesn't matter.

2631
02:05:24,710 --> 02:05:25,530
It was just me.

2632
02:05:25,850 --> 02:05:27,030
It doesn't matter.

2633
02:05:30,830 --> 02:05:32,290
Oh, my god.

2634
02:05:32,610 --> 02:05:33,350
That's fine.

2635
02:05:33,510 --> 02:05:34,570
Don't get off it.

2636
02:05:35,390 --> 02:05:36,830
Oh, we got off it.

2637
02:05:39,330 --> 02:05:40,370
Faith lost.

2638
02:05:42,390 --> 02:05:43,610
Oh, my god.

2639
02:05:44,850 --> 02:05:45,290
He's...

2640
02:05:45,290 --> 02:05:46,290
He's Wakandan.

2641
02:05:47,590 --> 02:05:48,470
He's Wakandan.

2642
02:05:50,930 --> 02:05:51,990
Backroot is insane?

2643
02:05:52,270 --> 02:05:54,990
Well, I mean their 4 stack is... Their 4 stack is basic.

2644
02:05:55,190 --> 02:05:55,810
Or 3 stack?

2645
02:05:55,810 --> 02:05:57,650
I don't know if it's 3 stack, but...

2646
02:05:57,650 --> 02:06:01,030
TTK, Vinny, and SJP were the champions of the tournament.

2647
02:06:01,550 --> 02:06:02,390
Should I still believe?

2648
02:06:02,850 --> 02:06:03,630
I don't know.

2649
02:06:08,970 --> 02:06:11,030
Every time they all... I just...

2650
02:06:11,030 --> 02:06:12,070
What do I do?

2651
02:06:12,210 --> 02:06:12,750
I like...

2652
02:06:12,750 --> 02:06:15,350
I just stare at the death.

2653
02:06:16,550 --> 02:06:17,050
Like...

2654
02:06:18,810 --> 02:06:20,890
No one survives the moon.

2655
02:06:21,730 --> 02:06:22,250
And like...

2656
02:06:22,250 --> 02:06:24,170
Somebody has to die to that moon.

2657
02:06:24,250 --> 02:06:25,250
And I guess it's me.

2658
02:06:25,950 --> 02:06:27,530
Our tanks die so fast.

2659
02:06:27,690 --> 02:06:29,230
It's so hard to sustain them.

2660
02:06:30,930 --> 02:06:32,150
It's not the answer?

2661
02:06:33,510 --> 02:06:34,470
There's nothing else.

2662
02:06:34,550 --> 02:06:35,070
Cloak and dagger?

2663
02:06:35,170 --> 02:06:36,710
You don't sustain in cloak and dagger?

2664
02:06:37,190 --> 02:06:39,490
I think maybe we went Luna, cloak, and dagger?

2665
02:06:39,670 --> 02:06:40,830
I don't know, actually.

2666
02:06:41,230 --> 02:06:42,130
Or defensive ults?

2667
02:06:42,590 --> 02:06:44,610
But defensive ults doesn't matter because the moon...

2668
02:06:44,610 --> 02:06:46,450
Moon combo fucks you up.

2669
02:06:47,070 --> 02:06:48,770
I guess the only thing that you live from is...

2670
02:06:48,770 --> 02:06:51,130
Oh, I guess the only thing you live from is the Adamult.

2671
02:06:51,390 --> 02:06:52,910
I saved my ult for Adamult.

2672
02:06:54,910 --> 02:06:56,390
That's the only thing I can think of.

2673
02:06:56,990 --> 02:06:59,450
But it's like...

2674
02:06:59,450 --> 02:07:02,550
But it's like... It's so difficult because they have so many...

2675
02:07:02,550 --> 02:07:07,030
We have to use two support ults to live through one...

2676
02:07:07,030 --> 02:07:09,490
Like, to live through an ult combo.

2677
02:07:10,390 --> 02:07:11,790
So it's like such a waste.

2678
02:07:15,670 --> 02:07:16,630
It's such a...

2679
02:07:16,630 --> 02:07:18,770
IMO, I feel like it's such a waste.

2680
02:07:19,510 --> 02:07:21,270
But like, there's nothing else we can do.

2681
02:07:21,430 --> 02:07:22,650
So that's like the worst part.

2682
02:07:25,910 --> 02:07:26,430
Wow!

2683
02:07:28,810 --> 02:07:29,330
Wowee!

2684
02:07:30,010 --> 02:07:32,730
Everybody is taking so much damage!

2685
02:07:32,990 --> 02:07:33,950
Oh my god!

2686
02:07:34,950 --> 02:07:35,470
Wowee!

2687
02:07:39,110 --> 02:07:41,730
I feel like I should...

2688
02:07:41,730 --> 02:07:42,690
Oh my god, please.

2689
02:07:42,790 --> 02:07:43,910
I have to push the cart.

2690
02:07:44,530 --> 02:07:45,390
Please, guys.

2691
02:07:47,550 --> 02:07:49,670
We only have Adam here, so I'm pushing cart.

2692
02:07:54,010 --> 02:07:54,430
Alright.

2693
02:07:56,690 --> 02:07:57,490
Freeze them.

2694
02:07:57,570 --> 02:07:58,730
Let me freeze...

2695
02:08:00,670 --> 02:08:03,210
Let me freeze them before I die.

2696
02:08:04,030 --> 02:08:04,790
Oh no!

2697
02:08:05,070 --> 02:08:05,710
Save him!

2698
02:08:05,910 --> 02:08:06,390
Goodbye.

2699
02:08:08,210 --> 02:08:09,230
Guys, I froze him!

2700
02:08:09,690 --> 02:08:10,530
Guys, I did it!

2701
02:08:12,070 --> 02:08:13,810
I fucking did it, guys!

2702
02:08:15,370 --> 02:08:17,090
Oh my god, I feel like I'm gonna get grilled.

2703
02:08:17,930 --> 02:08:19,090
I feel like...

2704
02:08:19,090 --> 02:08:19,910
Guys!

2705
02:08:20,830 --> 02:08:21,230
No!

2706
02:08:21,390 --> 02:08:22,590
You think I... Okay.

2707
02:08:23,870 --> 02:08:25,270
Freeze the moon!

2708
02:08:27,990 --> 02:08:28,990
I did it.

2709
02:08:29,310 --> 02:08:31,250
Yeah, that was... No, Vinny is a really good tank.

2710
02:08:31,250 --> 02:08:34,450
I think Vinny and TK are really good tank players.

2711
02:08:36,610 --> 02:08:38,950
I didn't use my ult because I was like...

2712
02:08:38,950 --> 02:08:40,710
We'll just die from...

2713
02:08:41,290 --> 02:08:45,110
We'll just die from combo and then I'll ult in at this point.

2714
02:08:45,570 --> 02:08:46,350
I don't know.

2715
02:08:47,430 --> 02:08:49,450
This is such a...

2716
02:08:49,450 --> 02:08:50,270
It's scary.

2717
02:08:52,590 --> 02:08:53,010
I should...

2718
02:08:53,010 --> 02:08:56,330
I know I should orb my flankers, but like...

2719
02:08:56,330 --> 02:08:58,830
They take so many...

2720
02:08:58,830 --> 02:08:59,450
Oh no.

2721
02:09:00,430 --> 02:09:02,270
No, I couldn't kill!

2722
02:09:02,890 --> 02:09:04,450
Why do I keep getting...

2723
02:09:04,450 --> 02:09:05,250
Oh, thank god.

2724
02:09:06,870 --> 02:09:07,570
Yeah!

2725
02:09:14,330 --> 02:09:15,030
Intentional!

2726
02:09:19,710 --> 02:09:21,370
Guys, do you guys like that?

2727
02:09:21,410 --> 02:09:22,290
I freezed him.

2728
02:09:23,570 --> 02:09:24,270
Goodbye.

2729
02:09:24,270 --> 02:09:24,550
Goodbye.

2730
02:09:27,470 --> 02:09:28,550
I don't...

2731
02:09:28,910 --> 02:09:29,950
I don't win.

2732
02:09:34,050 --> 02:09:35,050
Oh, thank god.

2733
02:09:35,250 --> 02:09:36,770
Just fuck me, I guess.

2734
02:09:36,890 --> 02:09:37,870
I'm getting...

2735
02:09:37,870 --> 02:09:38,990
Fuck me.

2736
02:09:41,150 --> 02:09:41,910
I guess.

2737
02:09:42,110 --> 02:09:42,470
Just...

2738
02:09:42,830 --> 02:09:44,790
Just kill the Luna player.

2739
02:09:48,090 --> 02:09:48,710
I'm sorry.

2740
02:09:50,030 --> 02:09:50,790
It's okay.

2741
02:09:50,790 --> 02:09:52,290
I didn't...

2742
02:09:52,290 --> 02:09:53,390
It's understandable.

2743
02:09:53,870 --> 02:09:54,630
You know what?

2744
02:09:55,770 --> 02:09:57,150
It's fucking understandable.

2745
02:10:02,230 --> 02:10:04,030
Oh no, you're walled off!

2746
02:10:04,910 --> 02:10:05,570
No!

2747
02:10:07,370 --> 02:10:09,810
We can't save you!

2748
02:10:10,630 --> 02:10:11,630
Oh, that's huge!

2749
02:10:11,690 --> 02:10:12,070
That's huge!

2750
02:10:12,250 --> 02:10:13,690
Who's gonna do anything?

2751
02:10:13,990 --> 02:10:15,670
Oh, he's walled off still!

2752
02:10:15,750 --> 02:10:16,650
And I'm gonna die!

2753
02:10:25,530 --> 02:10:26,050
What?

2754
02:10:26,270 --> 02:10:27,290
There's nothing I can do.

2755
02:10:27,530 --> 02:10:28,490
I just get...

2756
02:10:28,490 --> 02:10:31,130
I just have to watch it all happen.

2757
02:10:31,350 --> 02:10:32,690
That's the most fucked up part.

2758
02:10:33,970 --> 02:10:35,850
Not the moon this time.

2759
02:10:36,730 --> 02:10:37,770
Are you...

2760
02:10:37,770 --> 02:10:38,690
Oh, sorry.

2761
02:10:38,850 --> 02:10:41,510
You're gonna have to die there for the sake of...

2762
02:10:42,830 --> 02:10:44,610
For the sake of...

2763
02:10:45,710 --> 02:10:46,230
Okay.

2764
02:10:49,070 --> 02:10:50,210
I froze him!

2765
02:10:52,690 --> 02:10:53,230
I froze him!

2766
02:10:53,230 --> 02:10:54,070
Guys, I did it!

2767
02:10:56,210 --> 02:10:57,370
I did it!

2768
02:10:57,470 --> 02:10:58,390
I froze him!

2769
02:10:58,510 --> 02:11:00,510
That's what you guys wanted me to do.

2770
02:11:02,290 --> 02:11:04,350
I think they chose not to do the whale anymore.

2771
02:11:04,730 --> 02:11:06,470
Because they were like...

2772
02:11:06,470 --> 02:11:07,650
They were like...

2773
02:11:07,650 --> 02:11:08,930
This is not fair.

2774
02:11:09,590 --> 02:11:10,550
And I agree.

2775
02:11:11,810 --> 02:11:12,990
I froze him.

2776
02:11:13,350 --> 02:11:14,130
Come on, please.

2777
02:11:14,490 --> 02:11:14,950
Please.

2778
02:11:15,030 --> 02:11:16,450
I swear to god.

2779
02:11:16,590 --> 02:11:16,970
Like...

2780
02:11:24,170 --> 02:11:24,730
There.

2781
02:11:24,970 --> 02:11:25,070
There.

2782
02:11:25,170 --> 02:11:26,050
Guys, I actually did it.

2783
02:11:27,210 --> 02:11:28,510
I actually froze him.

2784
02:11:29,430 --> 02:11:29,930
Real.

2785
02:11:31,310 --> 02:11:32,610
Okay, I need to go closer.

2786
02:11:32,810 --> 02:11:33,990
I think he might actually die.

2787
02:11:34,450 --> 02:11:36,230
I think he might actually die.

2788
02:11:40,610 --> 02:11:41,170
Okay.

2789
02:11:41,610 --> 02:11:42,610
Our lesbian is dead.

2790
02:11:43,390 --> 02:11:44,410
He is dead, I repeat.

2791
02:11:45,370 --> 02:11:45,910
He is.

2792
02:11:46,530 --> 02:11:46,990
Goodbye.

2793
02:11:46,990 --> 02:11:47,670
Goodbye.

2794
02:11:48,290 --> 02:11:50,430
Wait, he didn't use the whale?

2795
02:11:51,330 --> 02:11:52,770
I thought he was gonna...

2796
02:11:52,770 --> 02:11:54,150
Oh my god.

2797
02:11:54,990 --> 02:11:56,730
I thought he was gonna use the whale.

2798
02:11:57,230 --> 02:11:59,550
That's the only reason why I didn't ult.

2799
02:12:00,030 --> 02:12:01,570
I hate this.

2800
02:12:01,690 --> 02:12:02,750
This is actual hell.

2801
02:12:03,070 --> 02:12:03,790
This is torture.

2802
02:12:03,990 --> 02:12:06,410
This is the biggest mind game of my fucking life.

2803
02:12:09,930 --> 02:12:14,030
Oh, the one time I didn't use my ult.

2804
02:12:14,030 --> 02:12:15,990
He doesn't whale.

2805
02:12:16,670 --> 02:12:17,890
Bro, I fucking...

2806
02:12:17,890 --> 02:12:18,650
Oh my god.

2807
02:12:18,730 --> 02:12:21,350
I thought I was...

2808
02:12:21,350 --> 02:12:23,270
Fuck this.

2809
02:12:23,410 --> 02:12:24,510
I'm going in.

2810
02:12:28,230 --> 02:12:28,830
Goodbye!

2811
02:12:30,230 --> 02:12:31,090
Oh fuck, okay.

2812
02:12:31,730 --> 02:12:32,930
Alright, this is fine.

2813
02:12:33,890 --> 02:12:35,330
They commissioned me.

2814
02:12:36,190 --> 02:12:36,790
They did.

2815
02:12:37,530 --> 02:12:39,630
I'm getting mind gamed right now.

2816
02:12:39,930 --> 02:12:41,050
I'm getting mind gamed.

2817
02:12:41,150 --> 02:12:42,030
Please, I'm just...

2818
02:12:42,030 --> 02:12:43,090
Please, I don't scrim.

2819
02:12:43,270 --> 02:12:43,770
Please, stop.

2820
02:12:46,530 --> 02:12:50,730
Apparently, these teams scrim like five hours every day.

2821
02:12:51,390 --> 02:12:53,990
I'm sorry, but that sounds so miserable.

2822
02:12:54,270 --> 02:12:54,850
I'm sorry.

2823
02:12:55,270 --> 02:12:58,430
Like, five to six hours every day.

2824
02:12:58,690 --> 02:13:00,410
That's so...

2825
02:13:00,410 --> 02:13:02,530
For me, that sounds miserable.

2826
02:13:06,230 --> 02:13:07,270
I'm sorry.

2827
02:13:09,310 --> 02:13:11,730
I'm okay with playing rank.

2828
02:13:13,010 --> 02:13:20,010
I'm okay with rank for six hours, but I've done scrims before for Overwatch and they are so mentally draining.

2829
02:13:20,490 --> 02:13:24,070
Because you gotta play to the highest level every time.

2830
02:13:24,790 --> 02:13:26,530
And that's every day too.

2831
02:13:29,510 --> 02:13:31,850
It's like more...

2832
02:13:31,850 --> 02:13:35,790
Because you have to play as if it's a tournament every day.

2833
02:13:36,990 --> 02:13:38,030
That's for six hours.

2834
02:13:38,190 --> 02:13:39,570
I'm fucking around right now.

2835
02:13:41,450 --> 02:13:42,950
I'm like fucking around.

2836
02:13:44,130 --> 02:13:45,550
Yeah, but rank is different.

2837
02:13:45,690 --> 02:13:47,330
I'm literally not...

2838
02:13:48,230 --> 02:13:50,370
I am tryharding, but I'm not...

2839
02:13:50,370 --> 02:13:53,050
I'm literally talking to you guys and chilling.

2840
02:13:56,730 --> 02:13:58,550
So, it's like...

2841
02:14:00,130 --> 02:14:03,010
I'm just playing rank and hanging out with you guys.

2842
02:14:03,790 --> 02:14:06,030
In scrims, it's like...

2843
02:14:06,030 --> 02:14:09,910
Basically, you have to play at the highest level and calm and everything.

2844
02:14:10,250 --> 02:14:14,030
And make sure you coordinate and talk to people and everything.

2845
02:14:14,610 --> 02:14:16,890
And I can't do that.

2846
02:14:17,270 --> 02:14:18,390
Not anymore.

2847
02:14:18,510 --> 02:14:20,330
I'm not strong anymore for that.

2848
02:14:25,390 --> 02:14:27,230
I'm not strong enough.

2849
02:14:30,910 --> 02:14:32,650
I did that for...

2850
02:14:33,590 --> 02:14:36,310
I did that for Overwatch, but...

2851
02:14:36,310 --> 02:14:39,250
That was like years ago.

2852
02:14:39,550 --> 02:14:42,050
And it was so miserable.

2853
02:14:43,390 --> 02:14:44,370
I'm dead.

2854
02:14:45,570 --> 02:14:47,150
I'm fucking dead.

2855
02:14:51,640 --> 02:14:54,180
It's just like... I don't know what to do with that.

2856
02:14:57,800 --> 02:14:59,820
The eye of Agamotto.

2857
02:15:01,520 --> 02:15:02,340
It's okay.

2858
02:15:02,980 --> 02:15:04,180
What can you do?

2859
02:15:04,440 --> 02:15:07,480
Please, please let me at least live one more day.

2860
02:15:12,440 --> 02:15:13,440
Oh my god.

2861
02:15:14,260 --> 02:15:14,700
It's okay.

2862
02:15:14,820 --> 02:15:15,660
I lived.

2863
02:15:15,820 --> 02:15:16,720
That's all that matters.

2864
02:15:17,060 --> 02:15:18,580
I lived.

2865
02:15:19,660 --> 02:15:21,040
I'm pretty sure the tournament...

2866
02:15:21,040 --> 02:15:24,600
People... Okay, the thing I'm like really scared about...

2867
02:15:24,600 --> 02:15:33,380
The thing I'm like really, really scared about for the tournament is that everybody is gonna be like...

2868
02:15:33,380 --> 02:15:39,680
Everyone is gonna be practicing the Groot-Moon Knight combo.

2869
02:15:39,920 --> 02:15:40,780
Cause it's such...

2870
02:15:40,780 --> 02:15:43,780
It's such an easy win condition.

2871
02:15:44,020 --> 02:15:45,380
It's so frustrating.

2872
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:48,660
It's whoever team is the better...

2873
02:15:51,040 --> 02:15:53,620
Moon Knight... Groot Knight player.

2874
02:15:54,460 --> 02:15:57,020
Cause it's such an easy combo to coordinate.

2875
02:15:57,800 --> 02:15:59,680
And then... But then you ban Groot.

2876
02:16:00,060 --> 02:16:01,420
Then like...

2877
02:16:01,420 --> 02:16:02,920
You're wasting a ban slot.

2878
02:16:03,460 --> 02:16:05,040
And that's the worst part.

2879
02:16:05,780 --> 02:16:06,420
Like...

2880
02:16:08,320 --> 02:16:09,520
You're like...

2881
02:16:09,520 --> 02:16:12,380
You have to waste the void slots too.

2882
02:16:12,600 --> 02:16:13,660
And I'm fucking...

2883
02:16:13,660 --> 02:16:19,980
And I know a lot of teams... A lot of teams are practicing with Groot...

2884
02:16:20,940 --> 02:16:22,340
With Groot-Moon Knight.

2885
02:16:22,700 --> 02:16:25,020
So I feel like a lot of...

2886
02:16:25,020 --> 02:16:30,980
If you don't ban Groot or Moon Knight a lot of teams in the Twitch rivals are gonna run that shit.

2887
02:16:31,120 --> 02:16:33,600
Like it's... It's not gonna be fun!

2888
02:16:34,220 --> 02:16:34,940
Oh my god!

2889
02:16:34,960 --> 02:16:37,400
That's like the most unfun comp to play against.

2890
02:16:37,480 --> 02:16:39,340
Cause it's such a fucking mind game.

2891
02:16:40,320 --> 02:16:40,920
Like...

2892
02:16:40,920 --> 02:16:43,060
Cause nothing can...

2893
02:16:43,060 --> 02:16:46,740
Nothing can fucking...

2894
02:16:46,740 --> 02:16:48,160
Counter that.

2895
02:16:49,940 --> 02:16:50,620
Um...

2896
02:16:50,620 --> 02:16:52,320
Bum-bum-ba-dum.

2897
02:16:53,120 --> 02:16:55,060
Bum-bum-ba-dum.

2898
02:16:55,080 --> 02:16:56,540
Bum-bum-ba-dum.

2899
02:16:58,540 --> 02:17:00,520
Yeah, they're gonna exploit the hell out of it.

2900
02:17:00,580 --> 02:17:01,060
They are.

2901
02:17:01,580 --> 02:17:02,260
100%.

2902
02:17:03,520 --> 02:17:04,200
Um...

2903
02:17:04,660 --> 02:17:06,020
It's just frustrating.

2904
02:17:06,140 --> 02:17:08,220
That's like one of the most frustrating...

2905
02:17:08,740 --> 02:17:10,740
It's one of the most frustrating...

2906
02:17:11,860 --> 02:17:12,540
Um...

2907
02:17:13,960 --> 02:17:14,640
Um...

2908
02:17:14,640 --> 02:17:15,740
Combos they have.

2909
02:17:15,840 --> 02:17:18,680
I don't think there's a combo that's even...

2910
02:17:18,680 --> 02:17:23,100
There's a combo that's like worse than that.

2911
02:17:23,780 --> 02:17:24,280
Yeah, yeah.

2912
02:17:24,460 --> 02:17:26,100
You have to ban Groot.

2913
02:17:26,200 --> 02:17:26,960
You don't ban Moon Knight.

2914
02:17:27,020 --> 02:17:28,320
You have to ban Groot cause you don't...

2915
02:17:28,320 --> 02:17:31,640
But then Namor is so fucking dumb to play with.

2916
02:17:32,060 --> 02:17:33,540
To play against too.

2917
02:17:34,260 --> 02:17:34,740
Um...

2918
02:17:34,740 --> 02:17:37,100
I hate playing against Namor.

2919
02:17:37,480 --> 02:17:39,720
Because they buffed him.

2920
02:17:40,840 --> 02:17:41,860
Buffed his slow.

2921
02:17:41,860 --> 02:17:44,100
And it's so frustrating.

2922
02:17:46,040 --> 02:17:47,340
That's what I'm saying!

2923
02:17:48,120 --> 02:17:49,620
This is how they balance the game.

2924
02:17:49,760 --> 02:17:51,560
Just make everything so fucking strong.

2925
02:17:51,660 --> 02:17:52,840
Makes me hate everything.

2926
02:17:55,980 --> 02:17:57,320
Who's my team in the tournament?

2927
02:17:58,420 --> 02:17:59,920
Um... I posted on my schedule.

2928
02:18:00,260 --> 02:18:07,240
But it's me, Ryamazing, Gomez, Super Gomez, Hogs.

2929
02:18:07,360 --> 02:18:08,640
Three of them are from the Nightmares roster.

2930
02:18:08,840 --> 02:18:15,860
So me, Ryamazing, Super Gomez, Hogs, um... Coney, and uh...

2931
02:18:15,860 --> 02:18:17,900
I think her name is Sabubu.

2932
02:18:18,520 --> 02:18:20,560
Um... So me and Sabu are the support.

2933
02:18:21,200 --> 02:18:21,820
Uh...

2934
02:18:21,820 --> 02:18:24,020
Gomez and Ryamazing are the DPS.

2935
02:18:24,520 --> 02:18:26,180
Hogs and Coney are the tank players.

2936
02:18:26,440 --> 02:18:28,480
And we're trying to...

2937
02:18:28,480 --> 02:18:32,500
We're trying to get a... We're trying to organize a scrim this week before...

2938
02:18:32,500 --> 02:18:33,620
Uh...

2939
02:18:33,620 --> 02:18:38,080
We're trying to organize a scrim with one of the other...

2940
02:18:38,080 --> 02:18:39,580
One or two of the other teams.

2941
02:18:40,680 --> 02:18:43,580
Uh... For the uh...

2942
02:18:43,580 --> 02:18:46,280
Before the tournament because we haven't played together yet.

2943
02:18:46,560 --> 02:18:51,480
So like I want to be able to play against one of the teams.

2944
02:18:51,520 --> 02:18:55,740
I want to play with my team to uh...

2945
02:18:55,740 --> 02:18:56,820
To like coordinate.

2946
02:18:57,360 --> 02:18:58,800
Like make sure our chemistry is okay.

2947
02:19:00,380 --> 02:19:01,860
Also, okay so like...

2948
02:19:01,860 --> 02:19:03,000
I was going to talk about this.

2949
02:19:03,360 --> 02:19:06,760
I avoid every MrFantastic player.

2950
02:19:06,960 --> 02:19:10,000
That's people who are trying to force MrFantastic especially in this ELO.

2951
02:19:10,500 --> 02:19:11,600
Because like...

2952
02:19:11,600 --> 02:19:14,060
Uh... MrFantastic is so dog shit.

2953
02:19:14,500 --> 02:19:15,500
And like...

2954
02:19:15,500 --> 02:19:19,560
There's a streamer that's doing like bronze to GM.

2955
02:19:19,920 --> 02:19:21,400
And they're trying to do it on every character.

2956
02:19:21,760 --> 02:19:24,680
And every other character he's done was so easy for him.

2957
02:19:24,920 --> 02:19:25,980
So he would get like...

2958
02:19:25,980 --> 02:19:27,880
It would be like 60 to 5.

2959
02:19:28,100 --> 02:19:29,260
Like 60 wins to 5.

2960
02:19:29,580 --> 02:19:31,780
And then he's trying to do MrFantastic now.

2961
02:19:32,120 --> 02:19:38,640
And then it's at 80 to... It was like 83 wins and 82 losses.

2962
02:19:39,720 --> 02:19:41,660
Like I think they've been stuck on...

2963
02:19:41,660 --> 02:19:45,820
I think they've been stuck on MrFantastic for 4 days now.

2964
02:19:45,960 --> 02:19:46,640
Since launch.

2965
02:19:47,140 --> 02:19:47,860
Since...

2966
02:19:52,400 --> 02:19:55,760
Like every other character has been like...

2967
02:19:56,280 --> 02:19:58,200
1 to 2 days.

2968
02:19:58,440 --> 02:19:59,800
And I think he's...

2969
02:19:59,800 --> 02:20:02,320
I've never seen that record before.

2970
02:20:02,540 --> 02:20:05,480
And I think that like explains how fucked up...

2971
02:20:05,480 --> 02:20:08,980
I don't think MrFantastic is a good character.

2972
02:20:11,100 --> 02:20:11,700
Like...

2973
02:20:14,880 --> 02:20:18,360
No, his ult is just... His ult is literally a worse Bucky!

2974
02:20:18,700 --> 02:20:19,900
It's... Oh my god.

2975
02:20:19,980 --> 02:20:22,340
Like it's literally a worse version of Bucky.

2976
02:20:22,640 --> 02:20:23,640
But like...

2977
02:20:23,640 --> 02:20:24,960
It's not even unlimited.

2978
02:20:25,620 --> 02:20:28,960
His ult is like a limited version of Bucky.

2979
02:20:29,020 --> 02:20:31,480
Cause you can only do it 6 times max I think.

2980
02:20:31,880 --> 02:20:33,900
While Bucky, you can again forever.

2981
02:20:34,380 --> 02:20:36,140
But he's so fantastic though.

2982
02:20:36,860 --> 02:20:37,780
He's so...

2983
02:20:37,780 --> 02:20:39,180
He's so...

2984
02:20:40,040 --> 02:20:41,600
He's so fantastic.

2985
02:20:42,120 --> 02:20:44,180
If he's so fantastic...

2986
02:20:44,180 --> 02:20:48,200
Then... Why do I see invisible women with...

2987
02:20:48,200 --> 02:20:49,400
Why do I see...

2988
02:20:49,400 --> 02:20:54,120
I don't think I should finish that sentence.

2989
02:21:00,620 --> 02:21:03,080
Hey... Whoa there buddy.

2990
02:21:07,860 --> 02:21:10,380
For those who don't know...

2991
02:21:10,380 --> 02:21:10,700
Alright.

2992
02:21:11,020 --> 02:21:12,260
In the early books...

2993
02:21:12,260 --> 02:21:13,020
I literally... Okay.

2994
02:21:13,120 --> 02:21:15,760
In the early books before Sue married Reed.

2995
02:21:15,940 --> 02:21:21,580
There was a big contention between Reed and Sue because she was in love with Namor and Reed.

2996
02:21:21,680 --> 02:21:24,500
And wasn't sure which one she wanted to be with her.

2997
02:21:25,020 --> 02:21:26,240
To be with.

2998
02:21:26,240 --> 02:21:26,320
Okay.

2999
02:21:28,140 --> 02:21:30,080
So they have...

3000
02:21:30,080 --> 02:21:31,080
They have history.

3001
02:21:32,960 --> 02:21:34,240
Namor was always...

3002
02:21:34,240 --> 02:21:38,660
I mean like he's running around in his underwear like...

3003
02:21:38,660 --> 02:21:39,980
Oh my god.

3004
02:21:39,980 --> 02:21:40,740
Not again.

3005
02:21:41,060 --> 02:21:42,440
Oh my god.

3006
02:21:42,640 --> 02:21:44,100
Oh my god.

3007
02:21:44,260 --> 02:21:45,960
We have to do this all over again.

3008
02:21:46,820 --> 02:21:47,400
I...

3009
02:21:51,200 --> 02:21:54,400
I'd be so down for that honestly.

3010
02:21:54,400 --> 02:21:56,640
Why don't we just ban Groot?

3011
02:22:00,580 --> 02:22:03,060
I'm so sick of Moon Knight already.

3012
02:22:08,770 --> 02:22:09,410
Alright.

3013
02:22:09,870 --> 02:22:10,770
Oh triple support.

3014
02:22:10,890 --> 02:22:11,910
Let's fucking go.

3015
02:22:14,990 --> 02:22:16,970
Namor was always a master creep.

3016
02:22:17,070 --> 02:22:19,630
Like he was a full-blown your body... Wait.

3017
02:22:20,010 --> 02:22:20,310
Wait.

3018
02:22:20,550 --> 02:22:20,890
Whoa.

3019
02:22:21,670 --> 02:22:22,930
Whoa Namor.

3020
02:22:23,190 --> 02:22:23,570
Whoa.

3021
02:22:25,290 --> 02:22:26,090
Whoa.

3022
02:22:27,190 --> 02:22:27,590
Perfect.

3023
02:22:28,090 --> 02:22:29,150
We have triple support.

3024
02:22:29,390 --> 02:22:30,490
With the... Okay.

3025
02:22:30,550 --> 02:22:30,770
Wait.

3026
02:22:30,890 --> 02:22:32,750
But they ban Wolverine.

3027
02:22:33,190 --> 02:22:33,530
Oh shit.

3028
02:22:34,390 --> 02:22:35,190
Cool.

3029
02:22:37,030 --> 02:22:38,290
I'll watch the Hulk ban here.

3030
02:22:40,110 --> 02:22:41,350
I told you.

3031
02:22:42,090 --> 02:22:42,670
Whoa.

3032
02:22:45,710 --> 02:22:46,510
Alright.

3033
02:22:49,450 --> 02:22:50,330
Double shield.

3034
02:22:50,550 --> 02:22:51,470
Triple support.

3035
02:22:51,470 --> 02:22:53,710
And then I'll know our third DPS.

3036
02:22:54,310 --> 02:22:56,230
Or our first... Our only DPS.

3037
02:23:02,450 --> 02:23:02,930
XO.

3038
02:23:03,170 --> 02:23:04,390
Thank you for the twitch prime.

3039
02:23:04,490 --> 02:23:04,710
Thank you.

3040
02:23:04,910 --> 02:23:05,350
Thank you.

3041
02:23:05,770 --> 02:23:07,330
Thank you for the twitch prime.

3042
02:23:07,470 --> 02:23:07,650
Thank you.

3043
02:23:07,710 --> 02:23:08,510
Thank you.

3044
02:23:11,730 --> 02:23:12,210
Oh.

3045
02:23:13,230 --> 02:23:14,610
Does he think they're stream sniping?

3046
02:23:14,710 --> 02:23:16,250
Is that why he isn't picking a character yet?

3047
02:23:20,390 --> 02:23:21,650
Is that it?

3048
02:23:25,270 --> 02:23:25,790
That's...

3049
02:23:31,370 --> 02:23:31,890
That's...

3050
02:23:31,890 --> 02:23:35,750
Their enemy Loki is the only Loki in this game with better stats.

3051
02:23:36,450 --> 02:23:36,970
Whoa.

3052
02:23:39,330 --> 02:23:40,470
He's better what than what?

3053
02:23:41,210 --> 02:23:43,150
There's no streamers poking through.

3054
02:23:43,730 --> 02:23:44,690
He's got better damage.

3055
02:23:45,370 --> 02:23:45,610
Oh.

3056
02:23:46,330 --> 02:23:48,930
I'm really tough to say something but I'll be nice.

3057
02:23:50,830 --> 02:23:51,390
Say it.

3058
02:23:51,390 --> 02:23:51,570
Say it.

3059
02:23:51,570 --> 02:23:52,010
Come on.

3060
02:23:52,010 --> 02:23:52,450
Say it.

3061
02:23:52,450 --> 02:23:52,510
Say it.

3062
02:23:52,510 --> 02:23:52,710
Say it.

3063
02:23:53,730 --> 02:23:55,730
It's for me.

3064
02:23:55,910 --> 02:23:56,890
It's for me.

3065
02:24:00,730 --> 02:24:07,130
I'm not going to ult first.

3066
02:24:07,510 --> 02:24:08,290
I'm going to hold my ult.

3067
02:24:10,090 --> 02:24:11,250
Actually I don't know.

3068
02:24:11,850 --> 02:24:13,430
Actually I don't know if I should.

3069
02:24:15,610 --> 02:24:18,230
I don't know if I should ult first or not.

3070
02:24:22,030 --> 02:24:24,470
I don't know.

3071
02:24:24,830 --> 02:24:27,790
I thought the same thing too but I didn't want to talk.

3072
02:24:37,990 --> 02:24:39,850
That's a little awkward guys.

3073
02:24:42,110 --> 02:24:45,830
I should have said something but I'm just a bystander.

3074
02:24:48,230 --> 02:24:50,430
I'm part of the problem.

3075
02:24:54,310 --> 02:24:56,250
I'm just a bystander.

3076
02:24:56,870 --> 02:24:59,870
The bystander effect is going on strong.

3077
02:25:02,330 --> 02:25:04,410
That's fucking right.

3078
02:25:08,550 --> 02:25:08,790
Oh.

3079
02:25:08,930 --> 02:25:09,870
Oh no.

3080
02:25:12,290 --> 02:25:13,830
Oh, same guy.

3081
02:25:14,570 --> 02:25:15,610
Same guy.

3082
02:25:27,930 --> 02:25:28,690
Oh.

3083
02:25:29,290 --> 02:25:30,330
I'm scared.

3084
02:25:31,110 --> 02:25:31,770
I'm scared.

3085
02:25:32,550 --> 02:25:33,870
I'm so scared.

3086
02:25:34,230 --> 02:25:35,390
I'm so scared.

3087
02:25:35,850 --> 02:25:38,870
Oh my god.

3088
02:25:38,950 --> 02:25:40,170
This is awkward.

3089
02:25:40,890 --> 02:25:41,830
This is so awkward.

3090
02:25:43,430 --> 02:25:44,790
Three Ludas.

3091
02:25:47,730 --> 02:25:48,650
Oh my god.

3092
02:25:48,770 --> 02:25:50,650
They have too many kill ults here.

3093
02:25:51,350 --> 02:25:52,050
Which is scary.

3094
02:25:53,110 --> 02:25:55,210
Wait, they're the same stack.

3095
02:25:55,370 --> 02:25:57,710
They literally got the same team.

3096
02:25:57,950 --> 02:25:58,430
What the fuck?

3097
02:26:00,270 --> 02:26:02,330
How did they get the same team?

3098
02:26:07,570 --> 02:26:09,290
Three stalling ults I guess.

3099
02:26:13,330 --> 02:26:14,690
Jesus Christ.

3100
02:26:14,810 --> 02:26:16,250
Our Groot is never gonna live.

3101
02:26:19,690 --> 02:26:20,550
Oh my god.

3102
02:26:21,030 --> 02:26:21,590
Please.

3103
02:26:24,610 --> 02:26:26,630
It's alright, we have this, right?

3104
02:26:27,490 --> 02:26:28,470
Alright, nice.

3105
02:26:28,950 --> 02:26:30,070
Let's all dance.

3106
02:26:30,730 --> 02:26:32,830
They have so many...

3107
02:26:33,830 --> 02:26:35,870
You guys are so dead.

3108
02:26:35,870 --> 02:26:36,650
What the fuck?

3109
02:26:41,480 --> 02:26:42,810
Holy shit.

3110
02:26:43,930 --> 02:26:45,630
You guys are so dead.

3111
02:26:46,450 --> 02:26:49,470
They have so many game ending ults.

3112
02:26:50,790 --> 02:26:51,770
Again?

3113
02:26:52,710 --> 02:26:53,430
Oh my god.

3114
02:26:56,700 --> 02:26:59,390
I can't dance anymore.

3115
02:27:02,810 --> 02:27:03,550
Please.

3116
02:27:04,610 --> 02:27:07,870
I don't wanna dance no more.

3117
02:27:09,570 --> 02:27:11,550
This is just like...

3118
02:27:12,890 --> 02:27:13,830
The ult.

3119
02:27:15,270 --> 02:27:17,690
My legs are so tired.

3120
02:27:17,870 --> 02:27:19,190
I'm so tired.

3121
02:27:21,910 --> 02:27:25,550
Please, I'm so tired of dancing.

3122
02:27:26,010 --> 02:27:27,350
Let me live.

3123
02:27:30,010 --> 02:27:30,510
Alright.

3124
02:27:31,510 --> 02:27:32,590
Dance, idol.

3125
02:27:33,110 --> 02:27:33,570
Dance.

3126
02:27:37,130 --> 02:27:41,520
Oh no, I missed my...

3127
02:27:41,520 --> 02:27:43,260
Oh my god.

3128
02:27:44,180 --> 02:27:46,360
Please, I'm so tired.

3129
02:27:47,760 --> 02:27:49,660
I'm so tired.

3130
02:27:53,550 --> 02:27:55,790
I couldn't... What do you mean?

3131
02:27:55,830 --> 02:27:56,510
Freeze him!

3132
02:27:57,670 --> 02:27:58,290
What the fuck?

3133
02:27:58,910 --> 02:28:03,010
Oh my god.

3134
02:28:04,790 --> 02:28:06,490
I'm so close to an ult, though.

3135
02:28:07,630 --> 02:28:08,970
I'm so close.

3136
02:28:09,110 --> 02:28:09,370
No!

3137
02:28:12,750 --> 02:28:13,570
This is so cancer.

3138
02:28:18,850 --> 02:28:22,470
This is hell.

3139
02:28:22,870 --> 02:28:23,850
This is actually hell.

3140
02:28:25,870 --> 02:28:30,730
Why didn't I freeze the... Why did I not freeze him?

3141
02:28:34,010 --> 02:28:35,310
My god, Doki.

3142
02:28:41,210 --> 02:28:44,950
Oh my god.

3143
02:28:47,770 --> 02:28:49,170
Holy shit.

3144
02:28:51,830 --> 02:28:53,890
This is... I hate this.

3145
02:28:54,370 --> 02:28:55,310
This is hell.

3146
02:28:55,690 --> 02:28:56,410
This is hell.

3147
02:28:58,030 --> 02:29:00,170
This is actual hell.

3148
02:29:00,650 --> 02:29:03,950
I hate these fights.

3149
02:29:06,010 --> 02:29:08,670
Oh my god.

3150
02:29:08,810 --> 02:29:09,510
Who ulted that?

3151
02:29:17,330 --> 02:29:20,390
I got them.

3152
02:29:31,470 --> 02:29:33,110
I'm so tired.

3153
02:29:33,530 --> 02:29:34,050
I'm so tired.

3154
02:29:34,050 --> 02:29:36,610
I'm so tired of dancing.

3155
02:29:42,190 --> 02:29:43,990
Oh my god!

3156
02:29:44,730 --> 02:29:46,110
This is so boring.

3157
02:29:46,390 --> 02:29:47,550
What the fuck is this?

3158
02:29:48,130 --> 02:29:49,470
I don't know what to do either.

3159
02:29:51,330 --> 02:29:52,850
No, you were right, by the way.

3160
02:29:52,950 --> 02:29:53,690
We should have banned the group.

3161
02:29:54,370 --> 02:29:55,830
I should have said so.

3162
02:29:56,010 --> 02:29:56,390
Guys.

3163
02:29:57,850 --> 02:29:58,570
Guys.

3164
02:29:58,570 --> 02:29:59,050
Guys.

3165
02:29:59,270 --> 02:30:01,510
This is why you don't do the bystanders.

3166
02:30:01,630 --> 02:30:02,770
Guys, this is a lesson.

3167
02:30:03,370 --> 02:30:08,110
This is a lesson to not do the bystanders.

3168
02:30:08,690 --> 02:30:10,670
In fact...

3169
02:30:11,390 --> 02:30:12,110
Guys.

3170
02:30:13,070 --> 02:30:17,770
And thus, when you know something's wrong, you gotta speak out.

3171
02:30:18,370 --> 02:30:20,750
Lesson on speaking out.

3172
02:30:22,110 --> 02:30:24,790
You gotta speak out, guys.

3173
02:30:25,290 --> 02:30:28,790
Don't let yourself become a bystander.

3174
02:30:36,430 --> 02:30:40,070
The price you pay is dancing forever.

3175
02:30:41,530 --> 02:30:43,310
You know, I was like, I'll just ban Groot.

3176
02:30:43,430 --> 02:30:45,290
And then everyone was like, NAMORIN!

3177
02:30:45,830 --> 02:30:46,990
NAMORIN MOON KNIGHT!

3178
02:30:47,170 --> 02:30:49,310
I was like, what the fuck, just ban Groot.

3179
02:30:49,630 --> 02:30:50,670
But I was like, whatever.

3180
02:30:52,270 --> 02:30:52,930
I don't care.

3181
02:30:54,790 --> 02:30:58,070
If I'm gonna pop ult first and then you count if you...

3182
02:30:58,070 --> 02:30:58,930
Like, what?

3183
02:30:59,550 --> 02:31:00,530
I count?

3184
02:31:00,770 --> 02:31:02,930
So I don't stack it like I did last game?

3185
02:31:03,510 --> 02:31:04,930
Did he say I'm gonna count?

3186
02:31:07,030 --> 02:31:08,430
Um, let's... Do you have a mic?

3187
02:31:08,910 --> 02:31:09,810
Oh, shit.

3188
02:31:11,650 --> 02:31:13,790
Oh no, I have to start counting.

3189
02:31:14,290 --> 02:31:15,690
Don't worry, he doesn't know I have a mic.

3190
02:31:17,730 --> 02:31:18,150
Jokey.

3191
02:31:19,490 --> 02:31:22,490
Oh my god, I'm gonna do a bystander if I didn't learn my lesson.

3192
02:31:22,490 --> 02:31:23,410
HAHA!

3193
02:31:25,410 --> 02:31:26,290
Okay.

3194
02:31:28,250 --> 02:31:28,690
HAHAHAHA!

3195
02:31:29,370 --> 02:31:30,310
Stay side.

3196
02:31:30,670 --> 02:31:31,930
I'm gonna...

3197
02:31:32,490 --> 02:31:34,470
Stop bystanding.

3198
02:31:36,650 --> 02:31:37,530
HAHAHAHA!

3199
02:31:39,110 --> 02:31:40,610
You're right, guys.

3200
02:31:41,070 --> 02:31:42,810
Bum, bum, badoom.

3201
02:31:43,710 --> 02:31:45,250
Bum, bum, badoom.

3202
02:31:46,210 --> 02:31:48,290
Jesus Christ, what the fuck?

3203
02:31:49,250 --> 02:31:50,190
What is this?

3204
02:31:51,610 --> 02:31:54,350
Oh my god, what the fuck is this?

3205
02:31:56,370 --> 02:31:58,230
Say something, do something, guys.

3206
02:31:58,350 --> 02:31:58,670
Remember.

3207
02:31:59,690 --> 02:32:00,290
HAHAHA!

3208
02:32:03,850 --> 02:32:06,150
Don't let this become like me.

3209
02:32:08,310 --> 02:32:09,410
Time to dance.

3210
02:32:09,510 --> 02:32:12,750
This is like one game I've actually wished I... I just wanna stop dancing.

3211
02:32:12,830 --> 02:32:13,570
I'm so tired.

3212
02:32:14,630 --> 02:32:15,230
HAHAHA!

3213
02:32:15,230 --> 02:32:15,870
HAHAHA!

3214
02:32:16,630 --> 02:32:20,350
You see, this is what I'm afraid of in the tournament.

3215
02:32:20,970 --> 02:32:21,270
HAHAHA!

3216
02:32:23,890 --> 02:32:25,910
Wow, I lived, bitch!

3217
02:32:31,010 --> 02:32:33,390
This is exactly what I'm afraid of.

3218
02:32:35,850 --> 02:32:38,050
Do as I say, not as I do.

3219
02:32:39,490 --> 02:32:40,850
Bum, bum, badoom.

3220
02:32:41,970 --> 02:32:45,230
That's why I hope games... I just hope tournaments are not gonna be like this.

3221
02:32:45,590 --> 02:32:45,950
But it might.

3222
02:32:46,270 --> 02:32:47,270
Actually, no.

3223
02:32:47,730 --> 02:32:49,230
It might not happen again.

3224
02:32:50,210 --> 02:32:50,490
Oh.

3225
02:32:53,010 --> 02:32:54,850
Bum, bum, badoom.

3226
02:32:57,110 --> 02:32:59,470
I'm gonna keep dancing.

3227
02:33:00,190 --> 02:33:02,470
I'm gonna dance.

3228
02:33:03,070 --> 02:33:05,630
I'm gonna dance forever.

3229
02:33:06,050 --> 02:33:07,210
Dance monkey.

3230
02:33:14,550 --> 02:33:15,470
HAHAHA!

3231
02:33:17,530 --> 02:33:17,610
Alright.

3232
02:33:18,790 --> 02:33:19,710
Oh.

3233
02:33:20,490 --> 02:33:22,830
I legitimately forgot about this ult.

3234
02:33:23,370 --> 02:33:24,050
Nice ult.

3235
02:33:26,590 --> 02:33:28,330
Dance monkey, dance.

3236
02:33:29,610 --> 02:33:31,350
That's all you're good for.

3237
02:33:31,350 --> 02:33:35,410
You just keep dancing until it's never over.

3238
02:33:35,570 --> 02:33:38,070
But the thing is, it's never over.

3239
02:33:38,450 --> 02:33:42,230
And then you're gonna dance until you graduate and retire.

3240
02:33:42,530 --> 02:33:48,150
And then you're gonna live through the fucking aftermath of just dancing.

3241
02:33:51,090 --> 02:33:54,310
No dance until it's done.

3242
02:33:55,350 --> 02:34:00,510
You'll never be happy because you're just a monkey to the system.

3243
02:34:00,510 --> 02:34:05,470
The more you dance, she's losing it.

3244
02:34:07,770 --> 02:34:10,610
I'm just... I'm just a monkey.

3245
02:34:10,770 --> 02:34:12,130
I have ult soon, I have ult soon, I have ult soon.

3246
02:34:12,670 --> 02:34:13,930
It's gonna be so fun.

3247
02:34:14,530 --> 02:34:14,890
Okay.

3248
02:34:15,550 --> 02:34:15,790
Go!

3249
02:34:16,750 --> 02:34:17,110
Dance!

3250
02:34:21,590 --> 02:34:21,950
Nice.

3251
02:34:22,150 --> 02:34:23,650
Okay, I was a little worried there.

3252
02:34:24,530 --> 02:34:27,570
This is hell, this is hell, this is hell, this is hell, this is...

3253
02:34:27,570 --> 02:34:28,870
No, I didn't have to ult.

3254
02:34:32,090 --> 02:34:36,930
This is hell, this is hell, this is hell.

3255
02:34:37,870 --> 02:34:40,570
Okay, that's fine.

3256
02:34:42,270 --> 02:34:43,110
I'm okay.

3257
02:34:45,770 --> 02:34:47,030
It's okay, I'm okay.

3258
02:34:47,250 --> 02:34:48,830
I'm okay now, I'm not crashing out.

3259
02:34:50,590 --> 02:34:52,250
I'm not crashing out, I swear.

3260
02:34:52,650 --> 02:34:54,210
Does nothing end?

3261
02:34:54,210 --> 02:34:55,050
This...

3262
02:34:56,980 --> 02:35:00,510
Does this just... Does this just go forever?

3263
02:35:01,330 --> 02:35:02,470
Oh, I missed my freeze.

3264
02:35:03,470 --> 02:35:09,410
I feel like... I feel like this is a fight that lasts just forever.

3265
02:35:09,990 --> 02:35:11,730
Nothing fucking ends.

3266
02:35:13,410 --> 02:35:14,750
Oh my god, please.

3267
02:35:16,290 --> 02:35:18,690
I'm just... That's all I am.

3268
02:35:19,550 --> 02:35:20,970
That's all I am.

3269
02:35:21,950 --> 02:35:24,390
Oh, here we go.

3270
02:35:25,370 --> 02:35:27,250
Here we fucking go.

3271
02:35:27,330 --> 02:35:28,790
Please, we gotta touch.

3272
02:35:29,490 --> 02:35:31,970
Guys, are we there?

3273
02:35:32,090 --> 02:35:33,390
I can't stop.

3274
02:35:35,210 --> 02:35:36,550
I can't stop.

3275
02:35:38,230 --> 02:35:38,990
There we go.

3276
02:35:39,610 --> 02:35:41,930
Kill everything.

3277
02:35:42,030 --> 02:35:42,630
Go crazy, boys.

3278
02:35:42,910 --> 02:35:43,970
Kill everything.

3279
02:35:44,470 --> 02:35:44,470
How?

3280
02:35:46,910 --> 02:35:49,970
How do we kill everything and nothing dies?

3281
02:35:50,970 --> 02:35:52,250
Oh no.

3282
02:36:02,730 --> 02:36:04,830
That was hell.

3283
02:36:05,190 --> 02:36:07,810
That doesn't even matter how much I died.

3284
02:36:07,930 --> 02:36:09,470
That was gonna be a great season.

3285
02:36:10,030 --> 02:36:13,970
You can rest now, fuck.

3286
02:36:15,190 --> 02:36:17,230
That's actually hell.

3287
02:36:17,230 --> 02:36:19,130
Nothing stopped.

3288
02:36:19,410 --> 02:36:22,870
I feel like everything was continuous.

3289
02:36:23,290 --> 02:36:25,690
Nothing ever stopped.

3290
02:36:26,270 --> 02:36:31,990
Oh my god.

3291
02:36:33,650 --> 02:36:38,170
I felt like nothing ever stopped.

3292
02:36:38,370 --> 02:36:42,430
It was just one incredibly long fight.

3293
02:36:43,790 --> 02:36:49,950
This is the one time I did not want to keep dancing anymore.

3294
02:36:50,970 --> 02:36:53,250
Dancing used to be so fun.

3295
02:36:53,990 --> 02:36:57,090
It used to be so fun, guys.

3296
02:36:59,590 --> 02:37:03,970
That was the game where I was like, I don't want to dance no more.

3297
02:37:08,490 --> 02:37:09,210
Sure.

3298
02:37:13,790 --> 02:37:14,690
I just...

3299
02:37:14,990 --> 02:37:17,450
Maybe dancing is not as fun as I thought.

3300
02:37:22,930 --> 02:37:26,230
Until they sucked all the joy out.

3301
02:37:26,630 --> 02:37:28,430
Until I realized...

3302
02:37:29,450 --> 02:37:33,430
Until I realized it was not as fun as it used to be.

3303
02:37:33,430 --> 02:37:35,870
I used to be that squid game guy.

3304
02:37:36,310 --> 02:37:39,610
Where I was hopeful and energetic.

3305
02:37:40,110 --> 02:37:42,770
And passionate about it.

3306
02:37:42,990 --> 02:37:45,250
And now I'm the second guy.

3307
02:37:45,350 --> 02:37:46,410
Now I'm season two.

3308
02:37:46,870 --> 02:37:51,690
Where I realized dancing isn't all that cut out to be.

3309
02:37:51,970 --> 02:37:54,790
I just want to stop dancing.

3310
02:37:56,010 --> 02:37:57,510
I felt like...

3311
02:37:57,510 --> 02:37:59,550
I felt like...

3312
02:37:59,550 --> 02:38:02,410
She has danced this dance before.

3313
02:38:08,050 --> 02:38:10,050
I felt like...

3314
02:38:10,050 --> 02:38:12,430
I legitimately felt like I didn't stop.

3315
02:38:12,570 --> 02:38:14,070
I was like...

3316
02:38:14,070 --> 02:38:17,170
By the time the other support finished the ult cycle.

3317
02:38:17,570 --> 02:38:18,970
I got my ult again.

3318
02:38:19,230 --> 02:38:20,690
And then I had to keep dancing.

3319
02:38:21,350 --> 02:38:23,210
It just didn't stop.

3320
02:38:23,490 --> 02:38:25,190
Legitimately, we were just cycling.

3321
02:38:25,530 --> 02:38:27,670
I felt like I was dancing every other fight.

3322
02:38:30,950 --> 02:38:35,090
I was dancing every other fucking fight.

3323
02:38:38,110 --> 02:38:41,670
It was a constant tango.

3324
02:38:45,110 --> 02:38:46,690
Oh my god.

3325
02:38:46,890 --> 02:38:48,610
I boogied her last boogie.

3326
02:38:49,550 --> 02:38:50,210
I was...

3327
02:38:50,870 --> 02:38:52,130
Keep dancing.

3328
02:38:53,690 --> 02:38:55,230
Keep dancing.

3329
02:38:55,970 --> 02:38:57,770
It's not over yet.

3330
02:39:00,470 --> 02:39:02,930
Alright, I'm gonna...

3331
02:39:02,930 --> 02:39:04,330
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

3332
02:39:04,470 --> 02:39:05,370
I'll be right back, guys.

3333
02:39:05,550 --> 02:39:06,390
How long has it been streaming?

3334
02:39:06,550 --> 02:39:06,750
Okay.

3335
02:39:07,290 --> 02:39:08,570
This might be LG.

3336
02:39:08,890 --> 02:39:09,810
This might be LG.

3337
02:39:10,250 --> 02:39:10,770
I can't.

3338
02:39:12,390 --> 02:39:13,930
I can't keep doing it.

3339
02:39:14,050 --> 02:39:14,390
I can't.

3340
02:39:14,970 --> 02:39:16,770
Those last two games were actual hell.

3341
02:39:18,510 --> 02:39:19,650
I'll be right back.

3342
02:40:42,510 --> 02:40:43,750
Alright, I'm back.

3343
02:40:44,090 --> 02:40:44,690
I'm back.

3344
02:40:47,880 --> 02:40:48,300
Alright.

3345
02:40:49,260 --> 02:40:51,420
Are they still fucking queuing?

3346
02:40:52,640 --> 02:40:53,560
Holy shit.

3347
02:40:53,760 --> 02:40:54,300
They are.

3348
02:40:58,420 --> 02:40:59,700
Fuck it.

3349
02:41:04,240 --> 02:41:04,960
Maybe.

3350
02:41:08,120 --> 02:41:09,240
Oh, wait.

3351
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,060
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

3352
02:41:12,180 --> 02:41:13,000
Wait a minute.

3353
02:41:14,880 --> 02:41:15,600
Wait.

3354
02:41:16,120 --> 02:41:16,440
Wait.

3355
02:41:16,760 --> 02:41:17,820
Wait a minute.

3356
02:41:18,200 --> 02:41:19,160
Okay, I'm...

3357
02:41:19,160 --> 02:41:20,400
I thought...

3358
02:41:22,480 --> 02:41:23,520
Something different.

3359
02:41:24,300 --> 02:41:26,920
Let them fight their four stack.

3360
02:41:30,500 --> 02:41:31,020
No.

3361
02:41:31,580 --> 02:41:32,520
I thought, like...

3362
02:41:32,520 --> 02:41:33,220
I thought...

3363
02:41:33,220 --> 02:41:35,500
He meant, like, we can fight it to the other...

3364
02:41:36,040 --> 02:41:36,520
To the...

3365
02:41:39,440 --> 02:41:40,260
Oh, shit.

3366
02:41:40,340 --> 02:41:41,120
There we go.

3367
02:41:42,280 --> 02:41:42,660
Great.

3368
02:41:42,840 --> 02:41:43,700
They fight each other.

3369
02:41:43,880 --> 02:41:44,360
Thank God.

3370
02:41:44,540 --> 02:41:45,840
Four stack versus four stack.

3371
02:41:45,920 --> 02:41:47,080
They fucking deserve each other.

3372
02:41:47,700 --> 02:41:48,220
Like...

3373
02:41:50,720 --> 02:41:51,440
Thank...

3374
02:41:52,800 --> 02:41:54,460
Thank fucking God.

3375
02:41:55,080 --> 02:41:55,600
Four stack.

3376
02:41:55,700 --> 02:41:56,400
Oh, my God.

3377
02:41:56,460 --> 02:41:57,140
It's true.

3378
02:41:57,640 --> 02:41:58,720
Like, we actually...

3379
02:41:58,720 --> 02:41:59,260
I actually...

3380
02:42:00,080 --> 02:42:02,320
Dodged them at the exact moment.

3381
02:42:03,180 --> 02:42:04,260
That's crazy.

3382
02:42:04,660 --> 02:42:06,520
The moment I cancelled the queue...

3383
02:42:07,060 --> 02:42:09,220
They matched up against each other.

3384
02:42:10,980 --> 02:42:11,700
It's...

3385
02:42:11,700 --> 02:42:13,660
Oh, my God.

3386
02:42:14,580 --> 02:42:15,300
Literally...

3387
02:42:15,300 --> 02:42:16,140
His team...

3388
02:42:16,140 --> 02:42:17,500
His team's four stack...

3389
02:42:17,500 --> 02:42:19,320
Is fighting against...

3390
02:42:19,320 --> 02:42:20,880
That fucked up...

3391
02:42:20,880 --> 02:42:21,680
Combo stack.

3392
02:42:23,660 --> 02:42:26,860
The moment I clicked cancel...

3393
02:42:26,860 --> 02:42:28,020
Holy fuck.

3394
02:42:28,100 --> 02:42:28,820
We didn't get to do...

3395
02:42:28,820 --> 02:42:29,320
Oh, my God.

3396
02:42:29,320 --> 02:42:30,000
I'm so happy.

3397
02:42:30,720 --> 02:42:32,100
I'm so fucking happy.

3398
02:42:32,200 --> 02:42:34,100
I don't have to go through that shit again.

3399
02:42:36,480 --> 02:42:37,980
Oh, my God.

3400
02:42:40,560 --> 02:42:41,940
We are saved.

3401
02:42:42,320 --> 02:42:43,980
They actually matched against each other.

3402
02:42:44,160 --> 02:42:44,860
We are fucked.

3403
02:42:44,860 --> 02:42:48,860
Now, they have to go through the cancer that I just went through.

3404
02:42:54,650 --> 02:42:56,230
Nice quick reaction.

3405
02:42:56,930 --> 02:42:57,710
Thank God.

3406
02:42:59,110 --> 02:43:00,190
I'm pretty sure...

3407
02:43:00,190 --> 02:43:00,450
Is it...

3408
02:43:00,450 --> 02:43:01,250
Are they like...

3409
02:43:01,250 --> 02:43:01,750
Were they...

3410
02:43:01,750 --> 02:43:01,950
Wait.

3411
02:43:04,170 --> 02:43:05,490
Are they...

3412
02:43:06,300 --> 02:43:07,310
Four stack...

3413
02:43:07,310 --> 02:43:10,290
Is the other team four stacking too?

3414
02:43:12,130 --> 02:43:12,790
Because...

3415
02:43:12,790 --> 02:43:13,810
Or are they...

3416
02:43:14,470 --> 02:43:15,990
Or is it trio?

3417
02:43:17,190 --> 02:43:18,730
Oh, that's fucking...

3418
02:43:18,730 --> 02:43:19,410
That's why.

3419
02:43:19,530 --> 02:43:19,730
Okay.

3420
02:43:19,770 --> 02:43:20,550
That makes more sense.

3421
02:43:20,630 --> 02:43:20,790
Okay.

3422
02:43:20,850 --> 02:43:21,930
This is why every...

3423
02:43:21,930 --> 02:43:24,010
All the high elo players four stack.

3424
02:43:24,130 --> 02:43:25,370
Because it's just so easy to win games.

3425
02:43:25,710 --> 02:43:25,950
Okay.

3426
02:43:25,990 --> 02:43:26,490
That makes sense.

3427
02:43:26,510 --> 02:43:28,590
Why they were even more coordinated than I thought they were.

3428
02:43:28,750 --> 02:43:29,150
Like...

3429
02:43:29,710 --> 02:43:31,070
I thought it was...

3430
02:43:31,070 --> 02:43:32,130
I thought it was a three stack.

3431
02:43:32,630 --> 02:43:34,270
Because at least they have three randoms.

3432
02:43:34,290 --> 02:43:36,810
But they had four professional players.

3433
02:43:37,490 --> 02:43:39,410
Basically, it was four pro players together.

3434
02:43:40,650 --> 02:43:42,010
That makes much more sense now.

3435
02:43:42,590 --> 02:43:42,990
Guys.

3436
02:43:42,990 --> 02:43:45,130
I was not gonna win against four pros, guys.

3437
02:43:45,190 --> 02:43:45,710
I was...

3438
02:43:45,710 --> 02:43:46,990
That's not...

3439
02:43:50,630 --> 02:43:51,150
Yeah.

3440
02:43:51,530 --> 02:43:52,530
I was...

3441
02:43:52,530 --> 02:43:54,910
I was not winning against four pros.

3442
02:43:55,050 --> 02:43:57,350
My teams were always like just randoms together.

3443
02:43:59,670 --> 02:44:00,190
Yeah.

3444
02:44:03,410 --> 02:44:04,050
You had it.

3445
02:44:04,110 --> 02:44:05,530
You just didn't believe.

3446
02:44:06,890 --> 02:44:07,590
That's what I'm saying.

3447
02:44:07,670 --> 02:44:08,890
That's why I'm really scared of the tournament.

3448
02:44:09,650 --> 02:44:10,990
I'm really scared of how...

3449
02:44:10,990 --> 02:44:12,210
Because I don't...

3450
02:44:12,210 --> 02:44:13,090
I know...

3451
02:44:14,690 --> 02:44:15,250
Four...

3452
02:44:15,250 --> 02:44:16,430
Five of the teams.

3453
02:44:16,570 --> 02:44:17,450
That's confirmed.

3454
02:44:18,150 --> 02:44:20,430
And there's two teams that I'm scared of.

3455
02:44:21,050 --> 02:44:23,690
But there's also twelve teams in total.

3456
02:44:24,150 --> 02:44:26,150
So I don't know the other half.

3457
02:44:26,730 --> 02:44:27,970
So I'm scared.

3458
02:44:28,510 --> 02:44:29,070
It's...

3459
02:44:29,070 --> 02:44:30,230
I know the captains.

3460
02:44:30,490 --> 02:44:31,830
I know who the captains are.

3461
02:44:31,850 --> 02:44:32,470
I know how...

3462
02:44:32,470 --> 02:44:34,090
I know ten of the captains.

3463
02:44:34,590 --> 02:44:37,850
But they never told me who were the last two captains.

3464
02:44:40,610 --> 02:44:41,450
So like...

3465
02:44:41,450 --> 02:44:42,850
I hope we get top four.

3466
02:44:43,310 --> 02:44:45,050
Because if I have to play like...

3467
02:44:45,050 --> 02:44:47,450
If I have to play in a tournament setting and these are...

3468
02:44:47,450 --> 02:44:50,890
Well, it'll be easier because we're all coordinated in a team together.

3469
02:44:51,850 --> 02:44:54,430
We're all coordinated as a team together this time.

3470
02:44:55,110 --> 02:44:56,790
Because this one we have to deal with like...

3471
02:44:56,790 --> 02:44:58,470
You know, we have like four other random players.

3472
02:44:59,130 --> 02:45:01,590
And which is the same in our other match that we had with them.

3473
02:45:02,830 --> 02:45:03,250
And...

3474
02:45:04,910 --> 02:45:05,750
And like...

3475
02:45:05,750 --> 02:45:07,830
I'm a little scared of...

3476
02:45:07,830 --> 02:45:09,150
Of like...

3477
02:45:09,150 --> 02:45:10,130
Whatever half...

3478
02:45:10,130 --> 02:45:10,830
I know like...

3479
02:45:11,350 --> 02:45:14,310
I'm a little scared what the other half of the teams are gonna be like.

3480
02:45:15,170 --> 02:45:16,010
So yeah.

3481
02:45:16,370 --> 02:45:17,830
That's why I hope we get...

3482
02:45:17,830 --> 02:45:19,430
I hope we get top four.

3483
02:45:20,050 --> 02:45:21,570
I hope we get top four.

3484
02:45:22,110 --> 02:45:23,870
That's my hope.

3485
02:45:24,330 --> 02:45:24,830
And I hope...

3486
02:45:25,950 --> 02:45:26,990
Also like...

3487
02:45:26,990 --> 02:45:27,790
They were like...

3488
02:45:27,790 --> 02:45:28,550
We should scrim.

3489
02:45:28,870 --> 02:45:30,790
But they never told me what time they are free.

3490
02:45:31,170 --> 02:45:31,790
So like...

3491
02:45:31,790 --> 02:45:33,830
If I don't hear anything from them...

3492
02:45:34,830 --> 02:45:36,810
If I don't hear anything...

3493
02:45:36,810 --> 02:45:37,630
From like...

3494
02:45:37,630 --> 02:45:38,810
My team...

3495
02:45:39,350 --> 02:45:39,970
And like...

3496
02:45:42,310 --> 02:45:44,030
By the end of...

3497
02:45:44,410 --> 02:45:46,710
By the morning of tomorrow...

3498
02:45:46,710 --> 02:45:48,330
I'm just gonna schedule something.

3499
02:45:48,470 --> 02:45:49,430
They gotta deal with it.

3500
02:45:55,930 --> 02:45:57,350
I'll be like...

3501
02:45:57,350 --> 02:45:58,070
I asked!

3502
02:45:58,290 --> 02:46:00,010
I gave you guys!

3503
02:46:00,490 --> 02:46:01,690
I asked!

3504
02:46:05,050 --> 02:46:05,650
I...

3505
02:46:05,650 --> 02:46:07,990
I literally told you guys.

3506
02:46:08,110 --> 02:46:08,890
And I said...

3507
02:46:08,890 --> 02:46:11,210
You had your chance!

3508
02:46:13,290 --> 02:46:13,890
I...

3509
02:46:13,890 --> 02:46:15,490
Okay, it might be tough for...

3510
02:46:16,250 --> 02:46:16,850
For...

3511
02:46:16,850 --> 02:46:17,730
Yeah, you're right.

3512
02:46:17,750 --> 02:46:18,690
It might be tough for Kony.

3513
02:46:18,950 --> 02:46:19,550
Like...

3514
02:46:19,550 --> 02:46:20,770
I asked Kony too!

3515
02:46:21,710 --> 02:46:24,150
I'm gonna take things in my own hands.

3516
02:46:25,650 --> 02:46:26,250
Exactly.

3517
02:46:26,890 --> 02:46:28,690
If they don't show up...

3518
02:46:28,690 --> 02:46:30,830
Then it's their reputation...

3519
02:46:30,830 --> 02:46:31,670
That they're damaging.

3520
02:46:31,670 --> 02:46:32,630
And not mine.

3521
02:46:34,090 --> 02:46:35,810
Cause I can be like...

3522
02:46:35,810 --> 02:46:36,730
Oh, I'm so sorry.

3523
02:46:36,830 --> 02:46:38,070
I told them to show up.

3524
02:46:38,150 --> 02:46:38,590
But like...

3525
02:46:38,590 --> 02:46:39,150
I'm here.

3526
02:46:43,410 --> 02:46:45,690
It's their reputation that's on the line.

3527
02:46:45,810 --> 02:46:46,430
Not mine.

3528
02:46:46,510 --> 02:46:48,030
I'm the responsible one.

3529
02:46:51,300 --> 02:46:51,760
Exactly.

3530
02:46:52,760 --> 02:46:54,180
Look, I was like...

3531
02:46:54,180 --> 02:46:54,800
Hey guys.

3532
02:46:55,620 --> 02:46:58,020
I need to know what time you're all free.

3533
02:46:58,360 --> 02:47:00,040
And if I don't hear a response...

3534
02:47:00,780 --> 02:47:01,240
In...

3535
02:47:01,240 --> 02:47:02,070
Within the morning...

3536
02:47:02,070 --> 02:47:03,910
I'm scheduling something.

3537
02:47:07,870 --> 02:47:08,810
It's too late.

3538
02:47:09,090 --> 02:47:10,730
I'm gonna schedule something.

3539
02:47:11,270 --> 02:47:12,990
And they gotta deal with it.

3540
02:47:13,710 --> 02:47:16,230
If they want that 5k...

3541
02:47:16,230 --> 02:47:17,310
Each, by the way...

3542
02:47:17,870 --> 02:47:20,190
Each person gets 5k...

3543
02:47:20,190 --> 02:47:22,270
If they wanna get that 5k...

3544
02:47:22,270 --> 02:47:24,130
I better see some fucking dedication.

3545
02:47:30,490 --> 02:47:31,250
Yeah.

3546
02:47:31,810 --> 02:47:33,930
First place is like 5k each.

3547
02:47:34,370 --> 02:47:34,790
Basically.

3548
02:47:36,490 --> 02:47:37,990
But like...

3549
02:47:37,990 --> 02:47:39,130
Everybody gets money.

3550
02:47:39,470 --> 02:47:39,810
So like...

3551
02:47:39,810 --> 02:47:40,830
Even when you lose...

3552
02:47:40,830 --> 02:47:42,650
You also get money too.

3553
02:47:44,050 --> 02:47:44,230
Yeah.

3554
02:47:44,290 --> 02:47:45,090
Scheduling conflict.

3555
02:47:45,790 --> 02:47:48,230
The matches for Sage Amslam...

3556
02:47:48,230 --> 02:47:49,730
Does not...

3557
02:47:49,730 --> 02:47:52,190
I have something...

3558
02:47:52,190 --> 02:47:52,750
For when...

3559
02:47:52,750 --> 02:47:53,130
I have...

3560
02:47:53,130 --> 02:47:54,110
I have to do something.

3561
02:47:54,110 --> 02:47:57,150
On one of the days...

3562
02:47:57,150 --> 02:47:59,730
For two of the days that the matches are gonna be in.

3563
02:48:00,130 --> 02:48:00,750
So like...

3564
02:48:00,750 --> 02:48:01,970
I just didn't see the point.

3565
02:48:02,510 --> 02:48:04,650
Cause I'm not gonna cancel my thing.

3566
02:48:05,030 --> 02:48:05,310
For it.

3567
02:48:06,230 --> 02:48:06,710
Like...

3568
02:48:06,710 --> 02:48:07,470
Also...

3569
02:48:08,150 --> 02:48:08,630
Like...

3570
02:48:08,630 --> 02:48:08,970
Yeah.

3571
02:48:09,150 --> 02:48:10,410
It's just...

3572
02:48:10,410 --> 02:48:12,410
Scheduling was just...

3573
02:48:12,410 --> 02:48:14,470
It just conflicted with my schedule.

3574
02:48:14,770 --> 02:48:15,110
And stuff.

3575
02:48:15,330 --> 02:48:17,170
Also, I was only gonna do it if the full...

3576
02:48:17,670 --> 02:48:19,450
Brawl Pro team was coming back.

3577
02:48:20,070 --> 02:48:22,410
Cause that was like the only thing I really wanna do.

3578
02:48:22,830 --> 02:48:23,330
Cause like...

3579
02:48:24,090 --> 02:48:26,630
I just really wanna play with Team Brawl Pro.

3580
02:48:27,070 --> 02:48:29,270
But literally, only Kony was gonna do it.

3581
02:48:30,130 --> 02:48:31,530
Everyone else was busy.

3582
02:48:33,070 --> 02:48:35,710
Slime, Brawl Pro, and...

3583
02:48:38,410 --> 02:48:40,670
Matt were all busy too.

3584
02:48:43,680 --> 02:48:44,980
So it's just like...

3585
02:48:44,980 --> 02:48:45,440
Oh well.

3586
02:48:46,080 --> 02:48:46,520
You know.

3587
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:47,960
It is what it is.

3588
02:48:52,640 --> 02:48:53,200
Yeah.

3589
02:48:56,260 --> 02:48:56,920
Like the moon.

3590
02:48:57,040 --> 02:48:58,640
I shine in darkness.

3591
02:48:59,560 --> 02:49:01,620
All it took was complaining.

3592
02:49:02,040 --> 02:49:03,120
Wait, did he complain?

3593
02:49:03,460 --> 02:49:05,080
Who am I gonna banish next?

3594
02:49:05,260 --> 02:49:05,820
Okay.

3595
02:49:07,360 --> 02:49:08,540
I was like, what?

3596
02:49:16,790 --> 02:49:18,510
The shame, I loved your Slime stream.

3597
02:49:18,630 --> 02:49:19,310
I miss your slime.

3598
02:49:20,190 --> 02:49:21,890
I feel like...

3599
02:49:22,890 --> 02:49:23,450
Oh.

3600
02:49:23,790 --> 02:49:24,130
Okay.

3601
02:49:24,570 --> 02:49:25,190
What the fuck?

3602
02:49:25,570 --> 02:49:26,210
Who was he?

3603
02:49:27,270 --> 02:49:28,390
Who were you?

3604
02:49:32,140 --> 02:49:33,760
Who were you, this guy?

3605
02:49:34,080 --> 02:49:35,000
I'll remember you.

3606
02:49:35,060 --> 02:49:36,200
I'm writing your name down.

3607
02:49:38,660 --> 02:49:40,720
You don't follow the crowd.

3608
02:49:41,120 --> 02:49:42,020
How dare you.

3609
02:49:47,170 --> 02:49:49,590
How dare you not be a fucking sheep.

3610
02:49:54,680 --> 02:49:55,060
Alright.

3611
02:49:57,080 --> 02:49:57,800
Yippee.

3612
02:49:58,700 --> 02:50:00,680
I get to practice more.

3613
02:50:01,960 --> 02:50:02,500
Yay.

3614
02:50:02,500 --> 02:50:02,700
Yay.

3615
02:50:07,160 --> 02:50:14,040
But who would have thought the other 4-stack is able to coordinate against the...

3616
02:50:14,040 --> 02:50:15,780
Oh, the other 4-stack banned Groot.

3617
02:50:15,860 --> 02:50:16,440
They're so smart.

3618
02:50:22,120 --> 02:50:23,740
They're much more smarter than...

3619
02:50:24,120 --> 02:50:25,640
You know, I feel like...

3620
02:50:25,640 --> 02:50:25,900
Yeah.

3621
02:50:26,160 --> 02:50:30,140
I feel like Kurova would have definitely told him to ban Groot.

3622
02:50:32,380 --> 02:50:34,140
They learn from us.

3623
02:50:35,100 --> 02:50:36,180
They're so smart.

3624
02:50:36,360 --> 02:50:37,040
They banned Groot.

3625
02:50:37,120 --> 02:50:38,080
Oh, we're doing it?

3626
02:50:38,160 --> 02:50:39,320
Oh my god.

3627
02:50:39,340 --> 02:50:40,560
Oh no.

3628
02:50:41,200 --> 02:50:41,640
Okay.

3629
02:50:42,740 --> 02:50:43,720
If only I...

3630
02:50:43,720 --> 02:50:46,260
I swear to fucking god.

3631
02:50:46,520 --> 02:50:48,360
I swear to god, if they're also gonna...

3632
02:50:48,360 --> 02:50:49,920
I swear to god, they're gonna Groot Moonlight.

3633
02:50:49,960 --> 02:50:51,200
I swear to god, I'm gonna...

3634
02:50:51,200 --> 02:50:53,540
I swear to god, I'm so fucking...

3635
02:50:54,220 --> 02:50:55,500
Oh my god, I...

3636
02:50:57,260 --> 02:50:59,200
Are we gonna be the problem?

3637
02:50:59,860 --> 02:51:00,720
Don't trust them.

3638
02:51:00,760 --> 02:51:01,380
Don't trust them.

3639
02:51:02,220 --> 02:51:03,600
I know, I was being sarcastic.

3640
02:51:04,540 --> 02:51:06,340
Oh no, I'm scared, guys.

3641
02:51:07,440 --> 02:51:08,620
I'm so scared.

3642
02:51:08,740 --> 02:51:09,520
I'm so scared.

3643
02:51:09,900 --> 02:51:11,680
Cause that means they're gonna do that too.

3644
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:13,180
I'm so scared, guys.

3645
02:51:14,260 --> 02:51:15,380
You'll suck it.

3646
02:51:15,640 --> 02:51:18,740
Yes, but I'm scared they're gonna do the same thing.

3647
02:51:19,100 --> 02:51:21,000
If we're doing it.

3648
02:51:22,080 --> 02:51:22,960
Oh, they are.

3649
02:51:23,360 --> 02:51:24,580
Oh, they are.

3650
02:51:24,680 --> 02:51:27,240
They have Namor and Groot.

3651
02:51:29,340 --> 02:51:30,760
Oh my god.

3652
02:51:31,860 --> 02:51:32,380
No!

3653
02:51:34,540 --> 02:51:39,160
It's whoever team has the better combo!

3654
02:51:41,400 --> 02:51:42,360
No!

3655
02:51:47,300 --> 02:51:49,480
Oh my god.

3656
02:51:49,860 --> 02:51:50,660
No!

3657
02:51:53,520 --> 02:51:56,420
Oh no, I'm so scared.

3658
02:51:56,660 --> 02:51:58,740
I'm so scared, guys.

3659
02:51:59,160 --> 02:51:59,700
I...

3660
02:52:00,540 --> 02:52:03,060
Guys, I don't think I'm gonna be happy.

3661
02:52:11,700 --> 02:52:20,740
Oh my god.

3662
02:52:20,760 --> 02:52:21,580
Oh, thank god.

3663
02:52:22,240 --> 02:52:22,900
Thank god.

3664
02:52:23,180 --> 02:52:24,460
Oh, thank god.

3665
02:52:26,380 --> 02:52:27,620
They're dead, they're dead.

3666
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:29,920
Dude, TTK's stack is killing them.

3667
02:52:30,160 --> 02:52:31,680
Dude, they are so boring to go against.

3668
02:52:32,100 --> 02:52:33,580
I'm just saying, I've never lost to TTK.

3669
02:52:33,580 --> 02:52:35,020
I've only won against them.

3670
02:52:37,740 --> 02:52:39,860
They are the most boring people of all time.

3671
02:52:44,420 --> 02:52:47,420
I'm pretty sure anyone can play Wolverine.

3672
02:52:48,120 --> 02:52:48,920
Oh shit.

3673
02:52:49,680 --> 02:52:51,580
I have my own whenever, by the way.

3674
02:52:52,280 --> 02:52:53,680
Not good, but they didn't do anything.

3675
02:52:55,540 --> 02:52:56,780
I'm gonna die, I might die.

3676
02:52:57,500 --> 02:52:58,980
I got an ult, I got an ult.

3677
02:52:59,100 --> 02:52:59,720
Pick ult, pick ult.

3678
02:53:01,100 --> 02:53:01,860
Oh shit.

3679
02:53:02,540 --> 02:53:04,180
I had to hide.

3680
02:53:04,300 --> 02:53:04,860
We took too long.

3681
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:05,760
I had to grab a pocket.

3682
02:53:16,260 --> 02:53:17,220
It's okay.

3683
02:53:17,460 --> 02:53:18,040
Thank you.

3684
02:53:21,300 --> 02:53:23,180
This is where I die.

3685
02:53:27,280 --> 02:53:27,760
Okay.

3686
02:53:27,760 --> 02:53:27,960
Okay.

3687
02:53:30,360 --> 02:53:32,860
I don't think we're stalling anymore.

3688
02:53:33,240 --> 02:53:34,020
Did they cap?

3689
02:53:34,660 --> 02:53:35,460
No, they didn't.

3690
02:53:35,620 --> 02:53:36,760
We're still, we're still...

3691
02:53:38,140 --> 02:53:40,640
Alright, wait, wait, they used their combo, they used their combo!

3692
02:53:40,860 --> 02:53:41,940
Don't need to fear!

3693
02:53:42,480 --> 02:53:43,560
Oh, they still have MR.

3694
02:53:44,240 --> 02:53:45,100
Oh, that's fucking stupid.

3695
02:53:46,580 --> 02:53:47,560
Oh my, guys.

3696
02:53:48,120 --> 02:53:50,400
I don't think I like Rivals right now.

3697
02:53:51,300 --> 02:53:52,400
I don't think...

3698
02:53:55,360 --> 02:53:56,640
Guys, I don't...

3699
02:53:56,640 --> 02:53:59,700
I guess unless we bind, we just have to ban group.

3700
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:00,560
We just...

3701
02:54:00,560 --> 02:54:02,840
We just have to ban group, guys.

3702
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:05,100
We just have to ban group, guys.

3703
02:54:08,280 --> 02:54:09,560
I think...

3704
02:54:09,560 --> 02:54:10,760
We just...

3705
02:54:10,760 --> 02:54:14,480
We just need to...

3706
02:54:16,400 --> 02:54:18,260
We just need to ban group.

3707
02:54:18,900 --> 02:54:19,700
We just...

3708
02:54:19,700 --> 02:54:20,380
Oh my god.

3709
02:54:20,380 --> 02:54:21,960
Oh my god, he was on top!

3710
02:54:28,080 --> 02:54:28,580
Okay.

3711
02:54:29,260 --> 02:54:32,260
This comp is actually so boring.

3712
02:54:33,560 --> 02:54:35,260
We can maybe copy Groot and look for Groot ult.

3713
02:54:35,660 --> 02:54:36,100
I don't know.

3714
02:54:36,280 --> 02:54:37,580
It's so boring.

3715
02:54:39,560 --> 02:54:42,580
Guys, I think they have the...

3716
02:54:43,260 --> 02:54:47,400
Guys, I think they have the better Groot player, I think.

3717
02:54:47,660 --> 02:54:49,740
I really think that we need to go not Madoka.

3718
02:54:53,700 --> 02:54:54,640
Madoka's pretty fine.

3719
02:54:55,540 --> 02:54:56,400
I don't know.

3720
02:54:56,560 --> 02:54:58,160
I just feel like we can't let it fucking go.

3721
02:54:59,200 --> 02:55:01,280
I couldn't do anything.

3722
02:55:03,100 --> 02:55:05,900
I think we have the better Groot, guys.

3723
02:55:11,320 --> 02:55:15,540
Strange one, strange one.

3724
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:17,420
I

3725
02:55:22,150 --> 02:55:23,610
hope you're happy!

3726
02:55:23,930 --> 02:55:25,390
I hope you're happy now.

3727
02:55:30,330 --> 02:55:31,370
Three, two...

3728
02:55:31,370 --> 02:55:33,050
Oh, and they have that too.

3729
02:55:37,430 --> 02:55:39,690
Oh my god, don't leave point.

3730
02:55:39,930 --> 02:55:40,590
We need point.

3731
02:55:43,190 --> 02:55:45,290
I hope you're happy now.

3732
02:55:47,450 --> 02:55:48,290
Do we have Loki...

3733
02:55:48,290 --> 02:55:49,370
We don't have Loki ult.

3734
02:55:49,690 --> 02:55:51,110
We don't have Loki ult.

3735
02:55:51,890 --> 02:55:53,870
No, I think this Groot is better than our Groot.

3736
02:55:54,010 --> 02:55:55,930
I 100% believe it.

3737
02:55:55,930 --> 02:55:59,430
I know we have a Lord Groot, but like...

3738
02:55:59,430 --> 02:56:00,230
I don't know.

3739
02:56:00,990 --> 02:56:03,010
They have Groot ult and I'm scared.

3740
02:56:03,350 --> 02:56:04,810
They should be coming up on their combo though.

3741
02:56:05,170 --> 02:56:05,850
We might as well care.

3742
02:56:05,970 --> 02:56:06,590
They TP behind.

3743
02:56:14,350 --> 02:56:15,630
I knew it!

3744
02:56:15,850 --> 02:56:17,160
Why didn't we punch him?!

3745
02:56:17,730 --> 02:56:19,010
I fucking knew it!

3746
02:56:19,530 --> 02:56:22,190
Oh my god, my brain was so high IQ!

3747
02:56:31,460 --> 02:56:32,340
I fucking knew it.

3748
02:56:32,340 --> 02:56:32,820
I fucking knew it.

3749
02:56:35,200 --> 02:56:36,240
Oh, we don't have TP anymore.

3750
02:56:37,480 --> 02:56:38,660
Oh my god.

3751
02:56:41,340 --> 02:56:43,100
Mr. Groot, he has Groot.

3752
02:56:44,320 --> 02:56:45,940
Don't worry, I'm on the broken character.

3753
02:56:46,200 --> 02:56:46,520
It's alright.

3754
02:56:47,340 --> 02:56:48,300
Hey, sick freeze though!

3755
02:56:48,420 --> 02:56:48,860
Sick freeze!

3756
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:50,020
The game like 10 times easier.

3757
02:56:50,180 --> 02:56:50,620
Alright.

3758
02:56:52,520 --> 02:56:52,960
Okay.

3759
02:56:53,600 --> 02:56:54,720
I think this will be fine.

3760
02:56:57,880 --> 02:56:58,880
Sick freeze though.

3761
02:56:59,100 --> 02:56:59,940
Sick freeze.

3762
02:57:01,620 --> 02:57:02,920
I can play Alistar first, yeah.

3763
02:57:05,240 --> 02:57:06,540
Or... you first.

3764
02:57:07,680 --> 02:57:08,900
Oh, actually no, me first.

3765
02:57:10,460 --> 02:57:11,480
I forgot.

3766
02:57:12,160 --> 02:57:12,960
I'm faster.

3767
02:57:15,060 --> 02:57:16,140
I'm faster.

3768
02:57:16,640 --> 02:57:17,880
So I should do it first.

3769
02:57:21,200 --> 02:57:22,680
Bum, bum, bum.

3770
02:57:24,800 --> 02:57:28,440
I'll play Luna just because she's the best healer right now.

3771
02:57:29,640 --> 02:57:31,160
But I'll play other characters.

3772
02:57:31,460 --> 02:57:34,000
And also for my team, I have to play Luna for tournament.

3773
02:57:34,760 --> 02:57:38,020
Because the other support is going to play Cloak and Dagger.

3774
02:57:38,740 --> 02:57:46,880
So I have to play Luna because the support duo is Luna with Cloak and Dagger.

3775
02:57:47,840 --> 02:57:49,600
So I'm just practicing more Luna.

3776
02:58:06,140 --> 02:58:07,960
Did they copy someone?

3777
02:58:08,660 --> 02:58:10,040
Who did they copy though?

3778
02:58:13,420 --> 02:58:14,580
No, fuck!

3779
02:58:14,640 --> 02:58:14,940
Okay.

3780
02:58:15,140 --> 02:58:15,500
Aww.

3781
02:58:16,200 --> 02:58:18,880
I have to... I didn't want to.

3782
02:58:20,640 --> 02:58:23,860
Okay, we're gonna get ulted here.

3783
02:58:25,320 --> 02:58:25,660
Yay!

3784
02:58:27,440 --> 02:58:28,320
I'm scared.

3785
02:58:28,700 --> 02:58:30,880
Scared, fear, fear.

3786
02:58:34,740 --> 02:58:35,420
Fear.

3787
02:58:37,540 --> 02:58:37,860
Fear.

3788
02:58:39,280 --> 02:58:40,820
Oh no, please copy me.

3789
02:58:40,900 --> 02:58:41,640
Please copy me.

3790
02:58:41,740 --> 02:58:41,880
No!

3791
02:58:41,880 --> 02:58:42,040
No!

3792
02:58:42,680 --> 02:58:43,860
You couldn't copy!

3793
02:58:46,660 --> 02:58:49,200
This was the perfect copy moment!

3794
02:58:51,140 --> 02:58:52,420
Okay, that's fine.

3795
02:58:52,500 --> 02:58:52,980
That's fine.

3796
02:58:55,360 --> 02:58:56,100
Alright.

3797
02:58:58,120 --> 02:58:59,220
It's fine.

3798
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:01,460
This is not fine.

3799
02:59:01,620 --> 02:59:03,600
Our group might be dead.

3800
02:59:05,260 --> 02:59:06,780
This is so fine.

3801
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:08,880
We're okay.

3802
02:59:09,860 --> 02:59:11,100
I have to pop.

3803
02:59:11,260 --> 02:59:14,300
Our group is like taking 2 million damage per second.

3804
02:59:16,840 --> 02:59:17,560
Alright.

3805
02:59:19,700 --> 02:59:20,520
We did it.

3806
02:59:24,120 --> 02:59:26,480
We've always been on mag!

3807
02:59:27,480 --> 02:59:30,920
No, we just swapped to mag, guys.

3808
02:59:31,060 --> 02:59:31,740
Just now.

3809
02:59:34,980 --> 02:59:36,300
I'm a little scared.

3810
02:59:38,880 --> 02:59:41,560
It's literally 1 HP.

3811
02:59:43,760 --> 02:59:44,800
No!

3812
02:59:52,940 --> 02:59:55,340
He can just do that?!

3813
02:59:57,900 --> 03:00:00,380
He can just fucking walk behind!

3814
03:00:01,840 --> 03:00:02,880
Okay.

3815
03:00:10,340 --> 03:00:11,340
He can just fucking...

3816
03:00:11,900 --> 03:00:12,680
Are you serious?

3817
03:00:13,020 --> 03:00:13,560
They can't...

3818
03:00:14,920 --> 03:00:15,680
What?!

3819
03:00:15,680 --> 03:00:17,340
Where is my copy?!

3820
03:00:20,060 --> 03:00:22,680
Will they ever copy?!

3821
03:00:22,680 --> 03:00:23,880
I guess I die.

3822
03:00:24,280 --> 03:00:24,880
I guess...

3823
03:00:24,880 --> 03:00:25,160
Please!

3824
03:00:25,500 --> 03:00:26,580
Copy one time!

3825
03:00:27,100 --> 03:00:28,120
Oh my god!

3826
03:00:29,780 --> 03:00:30,880
What are you...

3827
03:00:30,880 --> 03:00:32,020
Okay.

3828
03:00:32,620 --> 03:00:33,580
That's fine.

3829
03:00:38,200 --> 03:00:38,960
Okay.

3830
03:00:41,160 --> 03:00:42,620
Copy for...

3831
03:00:44,340 --> 03:00:46,790
I'm so mad.

3832
03:00:47,160 --> 03:00:49,780
I'm legitimately like...

3833
03:00:49,780 --> 03:00:54,340
I feel like I've been watching him hold copy for 20...

3834
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:56,620
I swear to god!

3835
03:00:57,980 --> 03:00:59,600
I watched him...

3836
03:00:59,600 --> 03:01:01,000
Oh my god!

3837
03:01:01,320 --> 03:01:03,580
Who are you holding copy for?!

3838
03:01:03,580 --> 03:01:07,600
Oh my god!

3839
03:01:07,600 --> 03:01:11,820
I had to die for no reason several times.

3840
03:01:15,760 --> 03:01:17,160
Oh my god.

3841
03:01:17,200 --> 03:01:17,560
I'm okay.

3842
03:01:17,700 --> 03:01:19,060
I'm okay, guys.

3843
03:01:19,320 --> 03:01:21,240
I'm so okay.

3844
03:01:21,640 --> 03:01:22,940
He's like...

3845
03:01:22,940 --> 03:01:25,630
And I'm literally...

3846
03:01:26,120 --> 03:01:26,630
Are you...

3847
03:01:27,540 --> 03:01:28,320
Okay.

3848
03:01:31,920 --> 03:01:33,020
Everything is fine.

3849
03:01:33,020 --> 03:01:34,020
Everything is...

3850
03:01:35,500 --> 03:01:37,520
Everything is so healthy.

3851
03:01:40,100 --> 03:01:42,140
Oh my god.

3852
03:01:42,280 --> 03:01:43,220
I have to...

3853
03:01:43,220 --> 03:01:47,260
I have to keep using ult as like a...

3854
03:01:47,620 --> 03:01:50,240
I can't even use ult to defend.

3855
03:01:50,820 --> 03:01:51,660
Like, it's...

3856
03:01:51,660 --> 03:01:52,480
It's hell.

3857
03:01:52,980 --> 03:01:53,660
It's hell.

3858
03:01:54,140 --> 03:01:55,020
It's actually...

3859
03:01:56,720 --> 03:01:57,700
It's hell.

3860
03:01:58,460 --> 03:02:00,460
Like, I don't know what to do.

3861
03:02:01,740 --> 03:02:02,680
It's actual hell.

3862
03:02:03,020 --> 03:02:04,020
I...

3863
03:02:04,020 --> 03:02:06,120
I feel like I'm trapped.

3864
03:02:06,520 --> 03:02:08,140
I'm trapped in this.

3865
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:13,640
I'm actually trapped.

3866
03:02:14,120 --> 03:02:16,040
I'm in the Twilight Zone.

3867
03:02:19,480 --> 03:02:22,400
I'm actually in the Twilight Zone right now.

3868
03:02:28,440 --> 03:02:30,400
Oh my god.

3869
03:02:32,100 --> 03:02:33,300
I'm trapped here.

3870
03:02:36,060 --> 03:02:37,700
My lowkey actually...

3871
03:02:38,120 --> 03:02:38,840
I wanna cry.

3872
03:02:45,340 --> 03:02:48,500
I actually wanna cry.

3873
03:02:50,000 --> 03:02:50,760
Oh my god.

3874
03:02:50,780 --> 03:02:51,460
He's dancing.

3875
03:02:52,560 --> 03:02:53,840
He's actually dancing.

3876
03:02:54,500 --> 03:02:59,100
I'm so...

3877
03:02:59,100 --> 03:03:00,040
Please.

3878
03:03:00,560 --> 03:03:01,700
Dance on the...

3879
03:03:01,700 --> 03:03:03,020
Please don't let him kill me.

3880
03:03:11,240 --> 03:03:11,760
Please.

3881
03:03:22,300 --> 03:03:22,580
Oh my god.

3882
03:03:23,700 --> 03:03:24,380
Oh my god.

3883
03:03:24,820 --> 03:03:25,980
Oh my god.

3884
03:03:26,300 --> 03:03:27,840
I don't have to waste my ult.

3885
03:03:30,240 --> 03:03:31,220
I'm not gonna...

3886
03:03:31,220 --> 03:03:32,040
I'm not gonna waste it.

3887
03:03:32,900 --> 03:03:34,380
Restrain yourself, Doki!

3888
03:03:34,380 --> 03:03:36,600
Oh my god.

3889
03:03:36,680 --> 03:03:37,360
There you go.

3890
03:03:38,300 --> 03:03:39,300
Okay.

3891
03:03:42,520 --> 03:03:43,060
Alright.

3892
03:03:43,620 --> 03:03:44,180
There you go.

3893
03:03:44,780 --> 03:03:45,840
I restrained myself.

3894
03:03:46,800 --> 03:03:52,180
We had our first group combo?!

3895
03:03:52,180 --> 03:03:53,520
I'm so sad.

3896
03:03:54,000 --> 03:03:54,860
I'm so sad.

3897
03:03:55,640 --> 03:03:57,360
I'm so fucking sad.

3898
03:03:57,840 --> 03:04:01,240
That was our first combo.

3899
03:04:01,240 --> 03:04:05,160
That was my first combo.

3900
03:04:05,800 --> 03:04:07,860
Oh my god.

3901
03:04:07,920 --> 03:04:10,420
You hear Luna at 63.

3902
03:04:11,900 --> 03:04:12,620
TP.

3903
03:04:14,240 --> 03:04:14,520
Wait.

3904
03:04:15,320 --> 03:04:17,320
Oh my god.

3905
03:04:18,680 --> 03:04:19,880
Oh my god.

3906
03:04:19,960 --> 03:04:20,740
I'm so calm.

3907
03:04:20,980 --> 03:04:21,420
I'm so calm.

3908
03:04:22,080 --> 03:04:23,340
I'm so calm.

3909
03:04:26,400 --> 03:04:27,620
It's Groot.

3910
03:04:27,920 --> 03:04:28,620
It's Groot.

3911
03:04:29,120 --> 03:04:30,100
Moon Knight.

3912
03:04:30,180 --> 03:04:30,860
That's the combo.

3913
03:04:30,860 --> 03:04:32,600
But we literally used it once.

3914
03:04:33,080 --> 03:04:36,500
He saved the copy for this moment.

3915
03:04:37,780 --> 03:04:38,480
We'll hit the first one.

3916
03:04:38,960 --> 03:04:40,040
We'll hit the first one.

3917
03:04:40,160 --> 03:04:40,500
We'll hit the first one.

3918
03:04:40,840 --> 03:04:41,500
Oh my god.

3919
03:04:43,360 --> 03:04:44,620
I'm 4% off.

3920
03:04:44,700 --> 03:04:45,320
I'm 4% off.

3921
03:04:45,840 --> 03:04:46,320
Okay, okay.

3922
03:04:48,280 --> 03:04:48,720
Okay.

3923
03:04:49,620 --> 03:04:51,160
Our Loki, like, fell.

3924
03:04:52,060 --> 03:04:53,900
I don't know if I accidentally...

3925
03:04:53,900 --> 03:04:55,260
I think it was me, though.

3926
03:04:55,320 --> 03:04:55,940
Not gonna lie.

3927
03:04:56,240 --> 03:04:57,420
I think I accidentally...

3928
03:04:57,420 --> 03:04:59,960
What the fuck happened?!

3929
03:05:01,040 --> 03:05:02,100
Oh my god!

3930
03:05:02,180 --> 03:05:02,800
We did it!

3931
03:05:02,800 --> 03:05:03,820
We did a combo!

3932
03:05:04,140 --> 03:05:05,880
I'm so proud of you guys.

3933
03:05:06,120 --> 03:05:07,080
I'm so proud.

3934
03:05:08,860 --> 03:05:10,180
You did it, Groot.

3935
03:05:16,580 --> 03:05:18,660
Oh no, they're gonna do it, too.

3936
03:05:20,220 --> 03:05:22,180
They're gonna do the same thing.

3937
03:05:22,800 --> 03:05:23,040
Now.

3938
03:05:24,760 --> 03:05:26,400
Not in my stu-

3939
03:05:32,560 --> 03:05:34,260
Oh, I'm on it.

3940
03:05:34,320 --> 03:05:34,980
I'm on it.

3941
03:05:35,080 --> 03:05:36,080
I got in.

3942
03:05:36,300 --> 03:05:38,000
Okay, everyone is dead.

3943
03:05:38,060 --> 03:05:38,460
Okay.

3944
03:05:38,860 --> 03:05:41,060
I don't know why.

3945
03:05:44,560 --> 03:05:45,240
Okay.

3946
03:05:48,640 --> 03:05:49,280
Alright.

3947
03:05:52,140 --> 03:05:52,580
Alright.

3948
03:05:52,960 --> 03:05:54,260
That's very unfortunate.

3949
03:05:56,440 --> 03:05:57,460
No, I did it!

3950
03:05:57,500 --> 03:05:58,540
I had to- Yeah, okay.

3951
03:05:58,740 --> 03:06:00,660
They're separated, but I had to save my tanks.

3952
03:06:00,760 --> 03:06:01,720
I ulted for my tanks.

3953
03:06:02,240 --> 03:06:03,300
My tanks live.

3954
03:06:05,860 --> 03:06:06,740
So, like...

3955
03:06:06,740 --> 03:06:07,420
Hey, guys.

3956
03:06:07,520 --> 03:06:11,700
All I'm saying is that I kept my tanks alive.

3957
03:06:12,420 --> 03:06:13,500
And I...

3958
03:06:14,480 --> 03:06:16,000
I did my mission.

3959
03:06:16,620 --> 03:06:16,920
But I won.

3960
03:06:17,780 --> 03:06:18,620
Alright, there you go.

3961
03:06:19,280 --> 03:06:20,180
Wait, they double support.

3962
03:06:20,400 --> 03:06:20,900
Wait, no.

3963
03:06:23,040 --> 03:06:23,520
Please.

3964
03:06:24,280 --> 03:06:25,060
I'm trying.

3965
03:06:25,480 --> 03:06:26,120
Oh, that's huge.

3966
03:06:26,240 --> 03:06:26,740
That's huge.

3967
03:06:27,500 --> 03:06:28,960
That's not huge anymore.

3968
03:06:30,220 --> 03:06:31,940
That's not huge anymore.

3969
03:06:32,860 --> 03:06:34,820
Our Loki doesn't use it defensively.

3970
03:06:38,140 --> 03:06:38,620
Okay.

3971
03:06:39,460 --> 03:06:40,420
Our Loki...

3972
03:06:40,420 --> 03:06:41,720
Our Loki...

3973
03:06:41,720 --> 03:06:43,440
Ults aggressively.

3974
03:06:43,660 --> 03:06:44,860
And he can't do that.

3975
03:06:44,980 --> 03:06:46,740
He has to ult defensively.

3976
03:06:46,740 --> 03:06:49,020
Because I'm ulting to keep our tanks alive.

3977
03:06:49,380 --> 03:06:51,080
And, like, we need a defensive ult.

3978
03:06:53,700 --> 03:06:56,420
Yeah, our Loki ults have been, like, really weird.

3979
03:06:58,480 --> 03:07:00,740
Like, his ult is, like...

3980
03:07:03,460 --> 03:07:04,580
Don't worry, he's brooding.

3981
03:07:07,680 --> 03:07:08,680
Did he do it?

3982
03:07:09,140 --> 03:07:09,520
He did.

3983
03:07:14,280 --> 03:07:15,280
It's okay, guys.

3984
03:07:16,740 --> 03:07:18,980
It's okay, we have a bigger trade.

3985
03:07:20,860 --> 03:07:21,420
What?

3986
03:07:23,300 --> 03:07:23,480
Okay.

3987
03:07:30,140 --> 03:07:34,100
Not gonna lie, I am not a big fan of these ults.

3988
03:07:35,360 --> 03:07:38,560
Like, this is how you're supposed to ult Loki dead.

3989
03:07:40,540 --> 03:07:43,700
But this is actually how you're supposed to...

3990
03:07:43,700 --> 03:07:47,000
This is how you're supposed to ult these.

3991
03:07:47,460 --> 03:07:49,280
He's dead, but, like, you know, let's see.

3992
03:07:49,880 --> 03:07:51,380
It's the thought that counts, though.

3993
03:07:54,640 --> 03:08:00,080
Okay, I know the loss is not my fault, though.

3994
03:08:01,480 --> 03:08:03,840
The loss is not my fault, guys.

3995
03:08:04,220 --> 03:08:06,400
It's not my fault.

3996
03:08:08,700 --> 03:08:09,880
Oh, he's dead.

3997
03:08:12,360 --> 03:08:14,960
It's actually... I've done my job.

3998
03:08:17,700 --> 03:08:20,200
Okay, okay, it's... Oh my god, it's been three hours.

3999
03:08:20,320 --> 03:08:21,040
Do I keep... Alright.

4000
03:08:22,380 --> 03:08:24,880
What's the maximum amount to get the drops, guys?

4001
03:08:25,340 --> 03:08:26,180
Guys, I de-ranked.

4002
03:08:26,220 --> 03:08:26,680
It's fine.

4003
03:08:26,900 --> 03:08:27,900
I can get it back.

4004
03:08:29,760 --> 03:08:31,940
Can't end on a loss, that's so true.

4005
03:08:33,520 --> 03:08:34,400
Four hours?

4006
03:08:35,040 --> 03:08:35,960
I forgot the four hours.

4007
03:08:36,340 --> 03:08:36,780
Goddamn.

4008
03:08:36,840 --> 03:08:38,040
Okay, I'll do one more hour.

4009
03:08:38,040 --> 03:08:41,740
I'll do one more hour to get... I'm back where I started.

4010
03:08:41,840 --> 03:08:42,180
That's fine.

4011
03:08:45,600 --> 03:08:47,820
I'll do one more hour for the hella skin.

4012
03:08:50,020 --> 03:08:51,520
I'm gonna avoid this Loki.

4013
03:08:51,600 --> 03:08:53,280
That Loki actually pissed me off.

4014
03:08:55,440 --> 03:08:58,240
That Loki made me so... Also, this Groot, too.

4015
03:08:58,300 --> 03:08:58,920
This Groot as well.

4016
03:09:01,180 --> 03:09:04,000
They've both made me mad.

4017
03:09:04,000 --> 03:09:08,700
Wait, are they... Are they still... Oh, they're in-game.

4018
03:09:08,820 --> 03:09:09,040
Okay.

4019
03:09:09,500 --> 03:09:09,980
Did they win?

4020
03:09:10,740 --> 03:09:11,500
I'm gonna check.

4021
03:09:11,940 --> 03:09:14,180
Oh, I can't... I can't download them.

4022
03:09:14,600 --> 03:09:14,820
Wait.

4023
03:09:15,380 --> 03:09:15,900
Right.

4024
03:09:16,680 --> 03:09:17,480
Does that hit it?

4025
03:09:17,700 --> 03:09:17,980
Alright.

4026
03:09:18,400 --> 03:09:19,340
I wanna know if they won.

4027
03:09:20,340 --> 03:09:21,100
Oh, they did!

4028
03:09:22,180 --> 03:09:22,640
Nice.

4029
03:09:23,340 --> 03:09:24,000
See, guys?

4030
03:09:24,220 --> 03:09:25,200
They banned Groot.

4031
03:09:26,200 --> 03:09:28,180
I wish we were smart enough for that.

4032
03:09:29,340 --> 03:09:29,980
LOL

4033
03:09:33,040 --> 03:09:36,180
Our Groot never got a combo off.

4034
03:09:36,540 --> 03:09:37,180
Actually.

4035
03:09:38,100 --> 03:09:41,740
Our Groot got the combo off one time and that was it.

4036
03:09:42,980 --> 03:09:44,420
Oh my god.

4037
03:09:44,720 --> 03:09:47,560
We just have to... We have to ban Groot.

4038
03:09:48,380 --> 03:09:50,180
If we don't ban Groot...

4039
03:09:50,980 --> 03:09:53,440
Ban Groot, I will actually...

4040
03:09:54,040 --> 03:09:56,140
I will actually just leave the game.

4041
03:09:56,140 --> 03:09:57,320
LOL

4042
03:10:07,660 --> 03:10:08,980
It's like...

4043
03:10:08,980 --> 03:10:10,640
It's like...

4044
03:10:10,640 --> 03:10:11,900
It's like... Sorry.

4045
03:10:11,980 --> 03:10:13,140
It's like hella...

4046
03:10:14,540 --> 03:10:17,660
It's like hella Hawkeye again.

4047
03:10:18,040 --> 03:10:19,120
But worse.

4048
03:10:19,320 --> 03:10:20,600
It's so much worse.

4049
03:10:20,740 --> 03:10:23,020
It's so much worse than hella Hawkeye.

4050
03:10:23,220 --> 03:10:24,200
I think like...

4051
03:10:25,660 --> 03:10:26,460
Groot...

4052
03:10:26,460 --> 03:10:30,440
Groot, Moon Knight, and Amour is so fucking...

4053
03:10:30,440 --> 03:10:34,540
More oppressive than hella Hawkeye.

4054
03:10:35,240 --> 03:10:38,060
It's actually so much more oppressive.

4055
03:10:38,440 --> 03:10:40,660
Because I feel like you can't do anything.

4056
03:10:41,060 --> 03:10:45,060
You can counter hella Hawkeye with positioning.

4057
03:10:46,020 --> 03:10:48,320
And... With positioning and like...

4058
03:10:49,780 --> 03:10:51,320
But it's like... It's like...

4059
03:10:51,320 --> 03:10:55,400
Whoever has a better Groot player wins the fucking game.

4060
03:10:55,580 --> 03:10:56,640
It's... Oh my god.

4061
03:10:56,700 --> 03:10:57,300
I can't.

4062
03:10:57,960 --> 03:11:00,080
I can't deal with that shit again.

4063
03:11:00,560 --> 03:11:05,320
I can't deal with having the... Whoever has the better Groot.

4064
03:11:06,040 --> 03:11:07,720
That shit was terrible.

4065
03:11:11,860 --> 03:11:14,600
Leaves game for not banning Groot.

4066
03:11:14,840 --> 03:11:17,540
I will fucking... I will leave the game if we don't...

4067
03:11:17,540 --> 03:11:19,080
You think I'm joking?

4068
03:11:19,260 --> 03:11:21,400
I will actually leave the game if we don't ban Groot.

4069
03:11:21,950 --> 03:11:25,900
We are... No, you don't get that privilege.

4070
03:11:27,240 --> 03:11:28,880
Wait, he's back?

4071
03:11:28,960 --> 03:11:30,280
I avoided him!

4072
03:11:30,660 --> 03:11:31,580
I'm banning Groot.

4073
03:11:31,960 --> 03:11:32,580
I don't...

4074
03:11:37,200 --> 03:11:39,780
I avoided him.

4075
03:11:41,340 --> 03:11:42,400
I fucking...

4076
03:11:43,540 --> 03:11:45,220
Oh no.

4077
03:11:46,540 --> 03:11:50,160
I actually avoid stream sniping.

4078
03:11:50,160 --> 03:11:51,340
He's back.

4079
03:11:53,380 --> 03:11:55,160
Wait, I don't know if it's because...

4080
03:11:58,890 --> 03:12:01,990
Yeah, this guy is stream sniping me.

4081
03:12:02,570 --> 03:12:03,950
Oh, I was already in queue.

4082
03:12:07,450 --> 03:12:09,150
Oh my god.

4083
03:12:09,490 --> 03:12:10,870
Little bitch.

4084
03:12:11,230 --> 03:12:12,250
Fuck off, Groot.

4085
03:12:16,320 --> 03:12:18,420
That's funny that he thinks I'm a one trick.

4086
03:12:21,580 --> 03:12:23,740
He's banning Luna.

4087
03:12:24,380 --> 03:12:25,360
That's silly.

4088
03:12:25,440 --> 03:12:27,460
I literally play everything else.

4089
03:12:31,720 --> 03:12:35,640
Oh, he... Wait, did he actually leave?

4090
03:12:36,460 --> 03:12:37,320
He dodged?

4091
03:12:37,940 --> 03:12:40,400
My goat has crash coming back.

4092
03:12:41,400 --> 03:12:43,540
Wait, is he actually...

4093
03:12:43,540 --> 03:12:44,980
Wait, is he actually gonna throw?

4094
03:12:45,280 --> 03:12:46,080
I can't tell.

4095
03:12:50,420 --> 03:12:51,020
Wait.

4096
03:12:52,400 --> 03:12:54,140
Gomez has connection with death if he throws.

4097
03:12:56,160 --> 03:12:56,560
Hahaha.

4098
03:13:05,150 --> 03:13:06,830
The ring guy left.

4099
03:13:06,910 --> 03:13:08,850
No, I know, but he said he's coming back though.

4100
03:13:11,390 --> 03:13:14,330
No, apparently Gomez says stream sniping is bannable.

4101
03:13:15,230 --> 03:13:15,790
Apparently.

4102
03:13:18,910 --> 03:13:21,810
But they have to be like super obvious about it.

4103
03:13:24,910 --> 03:13:29,310
Yeah, they'd be like super fucking obvious that you're stream sniping.

4104
03:13:30,110 --> 03:13:31,370
What's the deal with this Groot?

4105
03:13:31,470 --> 03:13:32,970
He just got diffed by the enemy Groot.

4106
03:13:33,010 --> 03:13:33,590
That's it.

4107
03:13:33,890 --> 03:13:36,790
And like, you get diffed.

4108
03:13:43,100 --> 03:13:45,680
No, Luna's a very common ban.

4109
03:13:46,060 --> 03:13:50,140
It's a very common ban because Luna is...

4110
03:13:52,040 --> 03:13:58,100
Luna makes the game like unplayable for like 12 seconds and people hate that, which is understandable.

4111
03:13:59,640 --> 03:14:02,220
It's very understandable to not want to play.

4112
03:14:02,440 --> 03:14:03,100
I'm solo healing!

4113
03:14:03,340 --> 03:14:04,100
I'm solo healing!

4114
03:14:04,400 --> 03:14:06,380
People need to remember, but people don't.

4115
03:14:07,160 --> 03:14:09,220
People don't remember that I'm solo healing.

4116
03:14:09,840 --> 03:14:10,180
Hahaha.

4117
03:14:14,120 --> 03:14:16,800
Like, what can I do?

4118
03:14:16,860 --> 03:14:17,920
I'm literally solo healing.

4119
03:14:18,040 --> 03:14:18,640
Oh, he's back.

4120
03:14:18,680 --> 03:14:19,120
He's back.

4121
03:14:22,300 --> 03:14:25,100
I completely forgot you were gone, to be honest.

4122
03:14:27,120 --> 03:14:28,240
Oh, he's here now.

4123
03:14:29,640 --> 03:14:30,180
Yippee!

4124
03:14:33,760 --> 03:14:34,300
Alright.

4125
03:14:37,440 --> 03:14:39,140
Alright, let's see how this is gonna go.

4126
03:14:39,240 --> 03:14:41,060
Now that we have the second healer.

4127
03:14:41,440 --> 03:14:43,260
People forgot I was solo healing.

4128
03:14:43,400 --> 03:14:46,020
Everyone was pushing as if we had a second healer.

4129
03:14:46,040 --> 03:14:46,580
It was crazy.

4130
03:14:46,580 --> 03:14:51,880
It was actually... It was very impressive.

4131
03:14:52,120 --> 03:14:52,980
Oh my god.

4132
03:14:53,180 --> 03:14:54,000
They'll be fine, right?

4133
03:14:54,900 --> 03:14:55,760
Will they be fine?

4134
03:14:55,940 --> 03:14:56,880
They'll be so healthy.

4135
03:14:57,480 --> 03:14:58,680
They'll be so healthy.

4136
03:14:58,720 --> 03:15:00,920
I think they'll be really healthy right now.

4137
03:15:01,900 --> 03:15:03,400
Wait, where's my strange?

4138
03:15:05,420 --> 03:15:07,100
What the fuck?

4139
03:15:07,240 --> 03:15:07,420
Okay.

4140
03:15:09,340 --> 03:15:09,920
Alright.

4141
03:15:11,200 --> 03:15:11,760
Nice.

4142
03:15:14,400 --> 03:15:16,100
Um... Do they have... No, cloak.

4143
03:15:16,320 --> 03:15:17,220
I'll come out here.

4144
03:15:20,920 --> 03:15:21,500
Alright.

4145
03:15:22,040 --> 03:15:22,800
That's right!

4146
03:15:23,640 --> 03:15:25,260
I got it up too!

4147
03:15:28,560 --> 03:15:30,140
That's... Oh my god.

4148
03:15:30,180 --> 03:15:30,980
I hate this.

4149
03:15:31,300 --> 03:15:32,740
Oh my god.

4150
03:15:32,880 --> 03:15:34,060
Okay, mine's longer too.

4151
03:15:37,040 --> 03:15:38,040
I don't know.

4152
03:15:38,520 --> 03:15:38,980
I don't know.

4153
03:15:39,000 --> 03:15:41,740
I'm just gonna throw this around and hope that...

4154
03:15:41,760 --> 03:15:43,520
I... I don't know.

4155
03:15:43,660 --> 03:15:43,880
Please.

4156
03:15:44,300 --> 03:15:44,580
Please.

4157
03:15:44,980 --> 03:15:45,640
Oh, thank god.

4158
03:15:45,740 --> 03:15:46,140
Thank you.

4159
03:15:46,380 --> 03:15:46,900
Thank you.

4160
03:15:49,420 --> 03:15:50,800
I don't know.

4161
03:15:51,680 --> 03:15:52,720
I don't know.

4162
03:15:52,820 --> 03:15:54,040
I'm gonna play here.

4163
03:15:54,380 --> 03:15:55,720
I'm gonna play here.

4164
03:15:56,640 --> 03:15:57,200
Nice.

4165
03:15:59,820 --> 03:16:00,500
That's fine.

4166
03:16:00,880 --> 03:16:02,260
I'm just gonna play here.

4167
03:16:02,260 --> 03:16:04,220
Oh my god.

4168
03:16:04,260 --> 03:16:05,220
This is... Thank god.

4169
03:16:05,340 --> 03:16:06,600
This Loki actually knows how to play Loki.

4170
03:16:06,800 --> 03:16:07,420
Thank fucking god.

4171
03:16:07,560 --> 03:16:08,500
I'm so happy.

4172
03:16:08,780 --> 03:16:09,660
I'm so happy.

4173
03:16:10,280 --> 03:16:11,100
I'm so happy.

4174
03:16:11,300 --> 03:16:12,720
I just went through pure hell.

4175
03:16:17,840 --> 03:16:21,480
I went through... I went through pure hell.

4176
03:16:24,420 --> 03:16:25,960
Okay, they have the moon though.

4177
03:16:26,520 --> 03:16:28,100
They have the moon.

4178
03:16:32,260 --> 03:16:33,700
They have the moon right now.

4179
03:16:34,180 --> 03:16:35,420
Oh my god.

4180
03:16:35,460 --> 03:16:35,720
Okay.

4181
03:16:35,980 --> 03:16:36,920
He's so good.

4182
03:16:37,080 --> 03:16:37,400
Okay.

4183
03:16:37,420 --> 03:16:38,520
He's so okay.

4184
03:16:39,160 --> 03:16:40,520
He's so okay.

4185
03:16:42,920 --> 03:16:44,360
I blind you!

4186
03:16:44,740 --> 03:16:47,040
I blind you and I'm gonna fucking suck!

4187
03:16:47,700 --> 03:16:48,600
That's right!

4188
03:16:50,560 --> 03:16:51,160
Oh shit.

4189
03:16:51,300 --> 03:16:51,620
You know what?

4190
03:16:51,720 --> 03:16:52,120
Fuck it.

4191
03:16:52,680 --> 03:16:53,240
We don't have to do this.

4192
03:16:53,240 --> 03:16:53,860
I'm gonna TP back.

4193
03:16:59,050 --> 03:17:02,210
Literally, we're so... We don't have to use my ult.

4194
03:17:03,710 --> 03:17:04,530
Are you serious?

4195
03:17:04,730 --> 03:17:04,990
Okay.

4196
03:17:05,690 --> 03:17:06,730
Alright, let's go in.

4197
03:17:07,110 --> 03:17:08,390
You all die now.

4198
03:17:09,150 --> 03:17:10,370
You all die!

4199
03:17:11,370 --> 03:17:12,230
Wait, what?

4200
03:17:13,370 --> 03:17:15,750
Okay, I guess we get the free push.

4201
03:17:16,590 --> 03:17:17,150
Guys, look.

4202
03:17:17,210 --> 03:17:18,330
I really wanted to live.

4203
03:17:19,650 --> 03:17:24,070
It's not a waste of my ult because we stagger them.

4204
03:17:24,850 --> 03:17:25,930
Guys, look at that.

4205
03:17:26,050 --> 03:17:27,490
Look at this stagger.

4206
03:17:28,490 --> 03:17:31,130
Guys, look at this stagger.

4207
03:17:32,030 --> 03:17:33,150
Right here.

4208
03:17:33,310 --> 03:17:34,150
That's right.

4209
03:17:34,530 --> 03:17:36,190
Oh my god.

4210
03:17:36,310 --> 03:17:37,190
Wait a minute.

4211
03:17:38,210 --> 03:17:38,670
Wait.

4212
03:17:40,370 --> 03:17:41,370
Guys, there's a Venom on cart.

4213
03:17:44,130 --> 03:17:45,130
What the fuck?

4214
03:17:45,130 --> 03:17:49,490
He didn't even say anything!

4215
03:17:52,130 --> 03:17:54,990
He said nothing!

4216
03:17:56,610 --> 03:17:59,690
What the fuck?

4217
03:18:00,870 --> 03:18:01,950
I don't understand.

4218
03:18:02,490 --> 03:18:03,830
I was like, wait a minute.

4219
03:18:04,050 --> 03:18:06,550
Why are people still contesting?

4220
03:18:07,330 --> 03:18:11,570
I like how the Venom said nothing.

4221
03:18:11,890 --> 03:18:14,550
I mean, the Loki said nothing.

4222
03:18:22,410 --> 03:18:24,050
That's so silly though.

4223
03:18:24,510 --> 03:18:26,150
I can't believe he said nothing.

4224
03:18:28,630 --> 03:18:30,770
Bro, we all broke!

4225
03:18:32,350 --> 03:18:33,470
We got the Venom on.

4226
03:18:34,470 --> 03:18:34,930
Venom one.

4227
03:18:35,030 --> 03:18:35,410
Venom one.

4228
03:18:37,290 --> 03:18:41,270
Why was he... He was like, I can 1v1.

4229
03:18:41,310 --> 03:18:43,710
What is a 1v1?

4230
03:18:44,730 --> 03:18:45,270
That's true.

4231
03:18:45,910 --> 03:18:46,770
That's so true.

4232
03:18:48,050 --> 03:18:50,750
He was like, why you ruin my 1v1?

4233
03:18:51,870 --> 03:18:53,010
Bro, I got this.

4234
03:18:53,830 --> 03:18:55,410
I fucking got it.

4235
03:18:58,370 --> 03:18:59,370
Did he hit him?

4236
03:18:59,810 --> 03:19:01,150
I don't think he hit him.

4237
03:19:01,450 --> 03:19:03,150
I have to use my ult now.

4238
03:19:03,830 --> 03:19:05,750
Now it's my ult.

4239
03:19:06,850 --> 03:19:08,810
Oh my god.

4240
03:19:08,950 --> 03:19:13,650
Oh my god.

4241
03:19:13,810 --> 03:19:15,950
That's four ults.

4242
03:19:16,470 --> 03:19:17,610
Holy shit.

4243
03:19:17,750 --> 03:19:19,450
How many ults was that?

4244
03:19:21,310 --> 03:19:22,870
Oh my god.

4245
03:19:25,210 --> 03:19:27,670
That was like four ults on each team.

4246
03:19:28,090 --> 03:19:29,290
That's crazy.

4247
03:19:29,850 --> 03:19:31,510
That's a lot of ults to be fair.

4248
03:19:33,610 --> 03:19:35,170
That's actually a lot of ults.

4249
03:19:37,310 --> 03:19:41,270
I was not expecting four different ults.

4250
03:19:41,410 --> 03:19:42,310
Oh wait, 30 seconds.

4251
03:19:43,530 --> 03:19:44,230
That's not good.

4252
03:19:44,270 --> 03:19:45,210
We got body blocked in.

4253
03:19:46,870 --> 03:19:47,750
This is the last fight.

4254
03:19:50,790 --> 03:19:51,930
We lost that?

4255
03:19:52,550 --> 03:19:54,650
There was four fucking ults, guys.

4256
03:19:55,090 --> 03:19:58,350
It was a lot of ults, guys.

4257
03:19:58,430 --> 03:19:59,330
You don't understand.

4258
03:19:59,330 --> 03:20:00,490
Yeah, it was.

4259
03:20:00,730 --> 03:20:03,070
It was fucking crazy.

4260
03:20:07,930 --> 03:20:08,910
That's not all.

4261
03:20:09,410 --> 03:20:10,130
That's not all.

4262
03:20:13,650 --> 03:20:15,130
It was... yeah.

4263
03:20:16,210 --> 03:20:18,710
I don't know if I can build my ult soon.

4264
03:20:19,050 --> 03:20:20,130
My ult is going to take a while to build.

4265
03:20:23,290 --> 03:20:24,150
Just live.

4266
03:20:24,150 --> 03:20:26,930
Wow, that sounds so easy, guys.

4267
03:20:27,830 --> 03:20:29,210
Just live, 4Head.

4268
03:20:32,110 --> 03:20:35,310
Wait, nobody is on the cart.

4269
03:20:37,310 --> 03:20:40,570
Okay, I need to make sure Super doesn't fucking die.

4270
03:20:41,910 --> 03:20:43,050
That's what I gotta make sure.

4271
03:20:44,710 --> 03:20:45,990
And also him too.

4272
03:20:46,570 --> 03:20:48,150
I'm like close to ult, but...

4273
03:20:49,410 --> 03:20:51,390
I need to build my ult here.

4274
03:20:51,710 --> 03:20:53,010
I need to build my ult here.

4275
03:20:54,150 --> 03:20:56,130
I need to build my ult here.

4276
03:20:56,290 --> 03:20:56,870
Come fast.

4277
03:20:57,950 --> 03:20:58,630
Nice, I got it.

4278
03:20:58,830 --> 03:20:59,670
I counter ult, though.

4279
03:21:02,310 --> 03:21:03,830
I got mooned.

4280
03:21:05,210 --> 03:21:06,710
I actually got mooned.

4281
03:21:07,170 --> 03:21:08,630
It happened so fast.

4282
03:21:09,470 --> 03:21:10,850
It happened so fast.

4283
03:21:10,910 --> 03:21:11,770
Like, what happened?

4284
03:21:13,350 --> 03:21:14,690
I got mooned.

4285
03:21:16,350 --> 03:21:17,650
I got mooned.

4286
03:21:18,050 --> 03:21:19,810
I got mooned, guys.

4287
03:21:19,970 --> 03:21:21,270
There was nothing I could do.

4288
03:21:21,270 --> 03:21:23,890
That moon hit me like a hurricane.

4289
03:21:28,620 --> 03:21:29,860
Oh, no.

4290
03:21:30,600 --> 03:21:31,540
Please don't die.

4291
03:21:32,380 --> 03:21:33,680
Please don't die.

4292
03:21:33,800 --> 03:21:35,060
I'm sending it in.

4293
03:21:42,140 --> 03:21:43,660
I'm going in.

4294
03:21:47,520 --> 03:21:48,400
No!

4295
03:21:51,250 --> 03:21:53,090
The mind game.

4296
03:21:54,710 --> 03:21:56,210
The stupid mind game.

4297
03:21:56,470 --> 03:21:58,630
The stupid fucking mind game.

4298
03:21:58,730 --> 03:21:59,810
I took my gamble.

4299
03:22:00,170 --> 03:22:01,850
I took my gamble.

4300
03:22:03,050 --> 03:22:04,110
Oh, my god.

4301
03:22:04,250 --> 03:22:06,830
I gambled and it didn't work.

4302
03:22:07,370 --> 03:22:10,970
I fucking risked my life for that gamble.

4303
03:22:11,530 --> 03:22:13,390
He actually... Oh, my god.

4304
03:22:13,450 --> 03:22:14,190
I need to remember that.

4305
03:22:14,370 --> 03:22:14,830
I need to remember.

4306
03:22:15,390 --> 03:22:16,530
Do not ult.

4307
03:22:16,670 --> 03:22:17,650
Do not ult.

4308
03:22:17,850 --> 03:22:20,030
Do not ult when he has it.

4309
03:22:20,570 --> 03:22:22,710
Do not do it, Doki.

4310
03:22:23,470 --> 03:22:24,930
Don't do it again.

4311
03:22:31,150 --> 03:22:34,150
Oh, no.

4312
03:22:34,270 --> 03:22:34,590
Oh, no.

4313
03:22:34,770 --> 03:22:35,050
Oh, no.

4314
03:22:35,750 --> 03:22:36,610
Oh, no.

4315
03:22:36,670 --> 03:22:38,350
I'm trying to help you.

4316
03:22:40,990 --> 03:22:41,430
No.

4317
03:22:41,630 --> 03:22:44,370
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4318
03:22:44,450 --> 03:22:45,470
I can't do anything.

4319
03:22:45,710 --> 03:22:46,830
I can't live.

4320
03:22:49,690 --> 03:22:50,810
So, no.

4321
03:22:51,050 --> 03:22:53,410
They have...

4322
03:22:53,410 --> 03:22:56,450
Why can't... Why can't... I don't know.

4323
03:22:56,630 --> 03:22:58,210
You know what's not fair?

4324
03:22:58,790 --> 03:23:04,930
Why can't their Cloak get to live against a Magneto ult and then I can't?

4325
03:23:07,410 --> 03:23:15,090
I need to get back into the headspace of like... I can't ult until this stupid Magneto does his spear.

4326
03:23:16,230 --> 03:23:17,350
Fucking always.

4327
03:23:17,630 --> 03:23:18,410
It's prep.

4328
03:23:22,010 --> 03:23:22,530
Oh, wait.

4329
03:23:22,670 --> 03:23:23,090
You're right.

4330
03:23:23,490 --> 03:23:24,250
Do they play Hulk?

4331
03:23:37,550 --> 03:23:39,130
Does Cloak have escape?

4332
03:23:39,690 --> 03:23:40,930
Yeah, she does.

4333
03:23:41,310 --> 03:23:41,750
This ability.

4334
03:23:43,330 --> 03:23:44,630
But I can't do it in time.

4335
03:23:45,510 --> 03:23:48,650
I couldn't do it in time because I got mooned.

4336
03:23:49,530 --> 03:23:53,190
It was like... I got mooned so I couldn't get it out in time.

4337
03:23:53,870 --> 03:23:59,530
And by the time I got... Because I was like... Because if I do it... Because if I try to do it...

4338
03:24:01,290 --> 03:24:06,810
In the middle of a moon, I die because the casting is too fast.

4339
03:24:07,930 --> 03:24:16,390
The moon casting is so fast that like if I do this... If I do the moon ability in the middle of a moon ult, I die.

4340
03:24:19,530 --> 03:24:21,650
You can't get the cheesy kills off no more.

4341
03:24:22,550 --> 03:24:24,850
So I have to be very careful.

4342
03:24:24,850 --> 03:24:26,850
So I didn't realize I lived a moon.

4343
03:24:31,910 --> 03:24:36,370
I've never seen Gomez play fucking Hulk before so this is going to be interesting.

4344
03:24:39,270 --> 03:24:43,650
Oh, now the Cloak gets to live for... THE CLOAK GETS TO LIVE FOR FREE?!

4345
03:24:44,410 --> 03:24:45,390
This is so bullshit.

4346
03:24:45,990 --> 03:24:47,370
This is actually so bullshit.

4347
03:24:47,630 --> 03:24:48,230
I'm so sad.

4348
03:24:49,590 --> 03:24:53,570
The Cloak actually... The Cloak gets to live for free.

4349
03:24:56,470 --> 03:24:58,110
I'm so sad now.

4350
03:24:58,110 --> 03:24:59,530
I'm so sad.

4351
03:25:00,010 --> 03:25:02,250
What am I supposed to do now?

4352
03:25:05,390 --> 03:25:07,110
I am so sad.

4353
03:25:07,290 --> 03:25:08,650
Oh, they're running triple support?

4354
03:25:09,090 --> 03:25:09,850
Oh my god, they're desperate.

4355
03:25:10,390 --> 03:25:11,470
They really want to win.

4356
03:25:16,730 --> 03:25:18,590
They really want to win.

4357
03:25:18,990 --> 03:25:21,470
Oh my god, that's when you know.

4358
03:25:22,370 --> 03:25:24,190
That's when you fucking know.

4359
03:25:27,510 --> 03:25:28,990
Oh my god, okay.

4360
03:25:29,510 --> 03:25:30,230
Please shoot the Ankh.

4361
03:25:30,290 --> 03:25:31,170
I can't shoot the Ankh.

4362
03:25:31,510 --> 03:25:32,650
Please shoot the Ankh for me.

4363
03:25:39,410 --> 03:25:40,050
Oh my god.

4364
03:25:40,050 --> 03:25:41,410
I can't... I can't use it.

4365
03:25:41,470 --> 03:25:42,230
Oh, fuck you.

4366
03:25:44,650 --> 03:25:45,990
Oh my god.

4367
03:25:49,750 --> 03:25:54,090
Oh, they don't... They don't Magneto on my Loki?!

4368
03:25:54,090 --> 03:25:56,770
I don't... I'm so mad.

4369
03:25:56,770 --> 03:26:06,290
I'm... I'm so... Oh, so when my Loki Mag ults, they don't Magneto.

4370
03:26:06,570 --> 03:26:09,910
But when I ult, they do.

4371
03:26:13,730 --> 03:26:14,810
Like,

4372
03:26:19,450 --> 03:26:20,070
okay.

4373
03:26:20,070 --> 03:26:20,410
Okay.

4374
03:26:25,010 --> 03:26:26,490
Okay, I can't.

4375
03:26:26,650 --> 03:26:28,470
I lost my ult.

4376
03:26:28,810 --> 03:26:30,170
I actually lost my ult.

4377
03:26:30,250 --> 03:26:31,410
I'm playing like shit right now.

4378
03:26:31,670 --> 03:26:33,750
No, I'm playing like fucking garbage right now.

4379
03:26:33,830 --> 03:26:34,130
I'm sorry.

4380
03:26:35,370 --> 03:26:36,870
I'm a little tilted.

4381
03:26:37,450 --> 03:26:42,630
I'm a little tilted right now.

4382
03:26:42,730 --> 03:26:45,190
I'm playing like fucking garbage on Cloak.

4383
03:26:46,130 --> 03:26:51,150
I'm just... I'm just sad that, like, it's just not fair.

4384
03:26:51,470 --> 03:26:52,830
I don't understand.

4385
03:26:53,710 --> 03:26:55,810
I don't understand.

4386
03:26:56,710 --> 03:27:00,370
Every time I ult, I get hit by Magneto.

4387
03:27:08,170 --> 03:27:09,930
I'm okay.

4388
03:27:10,730 --> 03:27:11,790
I'm right here.

4389
03:27:15,190 --> 03:27:17,670
They have Magneto, but I won't say anything.

4390
03:27:20,130 --> 03:27:22,110
Wait, I Cloaked.

4391
03:27:23,770 --> 03:27:25,090
I Cloaked it.

4392
03:27:25,450 --> 03:27:26,350
Wait, what?

4393
03:27:27,530 --> 03:27:28,490
Did it not work?

4394
03:27:34,790 --> 03:27:36,470
I Cloaked it.

4395
03:27:36,970 --> 03:27:38,450
Okay, I actually Cloaked it.

4396
03:27:38,670 --> 03:27:39,210
What?

4397
03:27:39,210 --> 03:27:39,710
What?

4398
03:27:49,830 --> 03:27:51,850
Our Cloak ult stayed though.

4399
03:27:53,510 --> 03:27:55,190
I actually... I thought I Cloaked him.

4400
03:27:57,330 --> 03:27:59,210
Okay, but I have my Cloak ult for free now.

4401
03:27:59,610 --> 03:28:00,310
I'm so happy.

4402
03:28:00,310 --> 03:28:02,410
Now he gets...

4403
03:28:03,750 --> 03:28:06,470
No, he kept the Cloak ult.

4404
03:28:06,650 --> 03:28:08,930
I saw it still on the floor, which was weird.

4405
03:28:10,610 --> 03:28:12,830
I didn't expect... I thought we'd lose it.

4406
03:28:15,130 --> 03:28:15,690
Alright.

4407
03:28:22,450 --> 03:28:23,850
Alright, this is it.

4408
03:28:28,160 --> 03:28:29,320
Alright, guys.

4409
03:28:29,780 --> 03:28:30,280
Okay.

4410
03:28:31,660 --> 03:28:33,660
Alright, we fight on point.

4411
03:28:33,820 --> 03:28:35,040
Wait, how did our guy die?

4412
03:28:37,880 --> 03:28:41,680
Wait, did he solo ult him?

4413
03:28:42,240 --> 03:28:43,860
Oh no, not disappear.

4414
03:28:44,140 --> 03:28:44,660
Wait, what?

4415
03:28:44,840 --> 03:28:45,780
Where did everybody go?

4416
03:28:46,340 --> 03:28:48,020
Why did we all go backwards?

4417
03:28:48,380 --> 03:28:49,200
Wait, what?

4418
03:28:49,360 --> 03:28:51,020
They're all just... Okay.

4419
03:28:52,020 --> 03:28:53,580
We all went backwards.

4420
03:28:57,580 --> 03:28:58,100
Alright.

4421
03:28:58,280 --> 03:28:59,020
Are we touching or not though?

4422
03:28:59,300 --> 03:29:00,300
I don't think we are.

4423
03:29:00,660 --> 03:29:01,600
I don't think we can.

4424
03:29:02,100 --> 03:29:03,460
Oh, we can't even touch.

4425
03:29:03,700 --> 03:29:05,140
Yeah, I don't think so either.

4426
03:29:06,700 --> 03:29:09,160
I was like, everybody just disappeared.

4427
03:29:09,620 --> 03:29:14,560
The moment I heard disappear, they all... they all disappeared.

4428
03:29:14,940 --> 03:29:15,480
That's crazy.

4429
03:29:18,620 --> 03:29:23,680
Oh my god, it like... my entire team actually went...

4430
03:29:25,640 --> 03:29:29,200
I don't know if that hits the range, but I did it for the sake of it.

4431
03:29:30,280 --> 03:29:32,000
I did it for the fun of it.

4432
03:29:32,780 --> 03:29:33,100
I don't know.

4433
03:29:33,140 --> 03:29:34,260
I'm a little worried right now.

4434
03:29:34,840 --> 03:29:37,700
I'm a little bit worried right now because...

4435
03:29:37,700 --> 03:29:39,240
Alright, I dodged it.

4436
03:29:39,620 --> 03:29:40,180
I think.

4437
03:29:41,280 --> 03:29:42,490
I think it was dodged.

4438
03:29:46,930 --> 03:29:49,650
Is my team okay right now?

4439
03:29:50,410 --> 03:29:52,490
Because I don't know if he is.

4440
03:29:52,870 --> 03:29:55,710
I don't know if my team is okay right now.

4441
03:29:56,050 --> 03:29:57,970
They have Magneto and I'm a little afraid.

4442
03:29:59,030 --> 03:30:00,530
I'm like actual fear right now.

4443
03:30:00,610 --> 03:30:02,830
Guys, guys, guys, we need a touch.

4444
03:30:03,250 --> 03:30:06,630
Guys, guys, we need a touch.

4445
03:30:06,910 --> 03:30:08,250
Guys, what are we doing?

4446
03:30:08,250 --> 03:30:19,050
Guys, guys, guys, guys, what was happening?

4447
03:30:24,750 --> 03:30:25,350
Oh,

4448
03:30:30,750 --> 03:30:31,650
we double support ulted.

4449
03:30:31,930 --> 03:30:32,730
That's not good.

4450
03:30:33,250 --> 03:30:34,330
That's actually not good.

4451
03:30:35,550 --> 03:30:36,270
That's not good.

4452
03:30:37,470 --> 03:30:38,650
Wait, what?

4453
03:30:41,410 --> 03:30:43,390
Okay, guys, okay.

4454
03:30:48,530 --> 03:30:49,290
Well,

4455
03:30:55,110 --> 03:30:55,610
shit.

4456
03:30:57,830 --> 03:31:01,290
Oh my god, that's funny because this guy doesn't talk either.

4457
03:31:01,290 --> 03:31:03,470
Okay, that team's sold.

4458
03:31:04,330 --> 03:31:06,250
That's funny because he's a...

4459
03:31:07,170 --> 03:31:08,990
Oh wait, no, there's a lot of hate watchers.

4460
03:31:09,150 --> 03:31:10,030
That's funny.

4461
03:31:11,570 --> 03:31:12,850
That's funny.

4462
03:31:13,170 --> 03:31:16,290
Imagine flaming and then the chat is against him.

4463
03:31:24,430 --> 03:31:25,150
Alright.

4464
03:31:29,350 --> 03:31:30,790
That's fucking hilarious.

4465
03:31:33,330 --> 03:31:34,130
There you go.

4466
03:31:34,690 --> 03:31:37,490
Bro sucks and wants to blame me.

4467
03:31:37,710 --> 03:31:40,530
The last game he fucked me was so bad.

4468
03:31:44,210 --> 03:31:45,890
Oh my god.

4469
03:31:49,090 --> 03:31:50,390
Yeah, he was... yeah.

4470
03:31:51,030 --> 03:31:51,650
That's silly.

4471
03:31:51,910 --> 03:31:52,710
What a silly guy.

4472
03:31:53,970 --> 03:31:55,210
I already avoided him.

4473
03:31:55,370 --> 03:31:56,930
It's because we didn't stop Q to avoid.

4474
03:31:57,850 --> 03:31:58,990
What a silly guy.

4475
03:32:04,270 --> 03:32:07,730
Imagine being... no, I like hate watchers because I can do this.

4476
03:32:07,870 --> 03:32:09,410
I can run a one minute ad.

4477
03:32:12,990 --> 03:32:17,590
That's why a lot of streamers encourage hate watching.

4478
03:32:18,270 --> 03:32:22,430
Because they can just run ads in front of the hate watchers.

4479
03:32:25,110 --> 03:32:28,830
Oh yeah, by the way, I always forget to say this before the stream.

4480
03:32:30,050 --> 03:32:37,830
Oh yeah, if you want to dodge the subscribe...

4481
03:32:40,970 --> 03:32:46,270
Not even hate... I mean that's the best part about people who hate watch people.

4482
03:32:46,450 --> 03:32:49,850
Because I don't know a lot of hate watchers.

4483
03:32:49,930 --> 03:32:51,050
I don't have a lot of stream snipers.

4484
03:32:54,510 --> 03:33:00,770
And it's also crazy the amount of ego you have to say that on a stream.

4485
03:33:01,330 --> 03:33:05,270
Because if anything, you're just getting hate on yourself even more.

4486
03:33:05,930 --> 03:33:11,450
Because that just invites people to fuck with you.

4487
03:33:15,430 --> 03:33:17,030
That's crazy.

4488
03:33:24,510 --> 03:33:28,190
And you have yourself to blame if you know you're doing bad and you watch the stream.

4489
03:33:28,370 --> 03:33:29,310
You have yourself to blame.

4490
03:33:29,610 --> 03:33:31,410
Because I don't watch streams if I knew I was bad on.

4491
03:33:31,570 --> 03:33:36,890
I don't watch streams of a person that's streaming that I know I did fucking terrible at.

4492
03:33:37,130 --> 03:33:37,830
Because I know I played bad.

4493
03:33:37,830 --> 03:33:38,970
That game I played pretty bad.

4494
03:33:39,070 --> 03:33:41,210
Because I was just like... I was tilted.

4495
03:33:41,570 --> 03:33:43,630
Because I was so tilted at the enemy Meganito.

4496
03:33:44,670 --> 03:33:46,190
I just hate the mind games.

4497
03:33:46,290 --> 03:33:47,630
The mind games...

4498
03:33:47,630 --> 03:33:54,270
Like... The mind games... I fucking hate it.

4499
03:33:54,310 --> 03:33:57,430
He didn't even kill the fucking Cloak and Dagger once with his Meganito.

4500
03:33:57,710 --> 03:34:01,890
But I kept... The Meganito killed me and the Loki several times.

4501
03:34:04,190 --> 03:34:06,630
Are you... I fucking...

4502
03:34:10,290 --> 03:34:11,950
I'm done after this game.

4503
03:34:12,070 --> 03:34:12,950
These Q's are cursed.

4504
03:34:13,630 --> 03:34:15,350
I'm actually done after this game.

4505
03:34:15,570 --> 03:34:17,130
These Q's are way too cursed.

4506
03:34:17,630 --> 03:34:19,390
I might play off stream.

4507
03:34:19,550 --> 03:34:20,630
I'm really...

4508
03:34:21,750 --> 03:34:22,970
Tired of it.

4509
03:34:23,070 --> 03:34:25,090
I'm gonna make a statement here, okay?

4510
03:34:26,110 --> 03:34:28,750
If one of you dodge... If one of you dodge...

4511
03:34:31,450 --> 03:34:32,470
I'm done.

4512
03:34:33,870 --> 03:34:34,850
With the snipers.

4513
03:34:39,730 --> 03:34:43,730
This is... This game is just... Horrible.

4514
03:34:44,290 --> 03:34:45,490
This is so horrible.

4515
03:34:45,790 --> 03:34:46,590
Oh my god.

4516
03:34:46,670 --> 03:34:47,330
No, this is...

4517
03:34:47,330 --> 03:34:49,190
We're stacking.

4518
03:34:51,670 --> 03:34:55,550
Why did we not ban Groot?

4519
03:35:00,370 --> 03:35:05,190
You can get your rank back.

4520
03:35:10,690 --> 03:35:15,130
Wait, really?

4521
03:35:15,130 --> 03:35:17,490
Wait, really?

4522
03:35:18,330 --> 03:35:22,010
Oh my god, he actually did it.

4523
03:35:25,870 --> 03:35:28,890
Wait, he actually did it.

4524
03:35:29,890 --> 03:35:31,290
Oh my god.

4525
03:35:32,230 --> 03:35:34,590
I didn't expect it.

4526
03:35:34,730 --> 03:35:35,590
That wild man.

4527
03:35:36,230 --> 03:35:37,970
I fucking... I was gonna ban Groot anyway.

4528
03:35:38,210 --> 03:35:39,530
That fucking wild man.

4529
03:35:39,530 --> 03:35:41,930
If he looks back... Okay, I'll actually pay him.

4530
03:35:42,170 --> 03:35:44,570
If he looks back...

4531
03:35:47,290 --> 03:35:49,950
If he looks back, that's like he's silly.

4532
03:35:53,300 --> 03:35:55,100
Oh yeah, no.

4533
03:35:55,160 --> 03:35:56,360
The enemy team is four stacking.

4534
03:35:59,060 --> 03:36:02,100
The enemy team is...

4535
03:36:03,440 --> 03:36:04,440
Four stacking.

4536
03:36:04,760 --> 03:36:07,960
So like, it's just not fun if you don't have a...

4537
03:36:07,960 --> 03:36:10,280
It's only fun if it's...

4538
03:36:11,480 --> 03:36:15,620
It's only fun if it's like four stack against four stack.

4539
03:36:15,740 --> 03:36:17,220
Because then it's like super coordinated.

4540
03:36:17,840 --> 03:36:20,540
Matches are much more... It's better.

4541
03:36:23,800 --> 03:36:24,760
But like...

4542
03:36:24,760 --> 03:36:25,240
I don't know.

4543
03:36:25,420 --> 03:36:28,400
It's not fun when it's like four stack versus random.

4544
03:36:28,700 --> 03:36:30,660
It's only fun when it's four stack versus four stack.

4545
03:36:31,160 --> 03:36:34,040
So like, I wouldn't mind if I'm in a four stack and I'm fighting them.

4546
03:36:34,080 --> 03:36:35,380
Because it's much more coordinated.

4547
03:36:36,780 --> 03:36:38,420
Because... It's because I'm not.

4548
03:36:38,620 --> 03:36:39,260
It's not fun.

4549
03:36:39,260 --> 03:36:40,440
And we have diamonds on our team.

4550
03:36:41,540 --> 03:36:42,340
We have diamonds.

4551
03:36:42,600 --> 03:36:44,320
No, this game is going to cancel after a minute.

4552
03:36:44,840 --> 03:36:45,640
It's going to cancel.

4553
03:36:47,900 --> 03:36:48,800
How much more?

4554
03:36:49,100 --> 03:36:50,140
I have 30 more minutes.

4555
03:36:50,240 --> 03:36:52,100
You guys just want to chat for 30 minutes?

4556
03:36:52,860 --> 03:36:53,440
Okay, do that.

4557
03:36:55,220 --> 03:36:56,920
Wait, actually I can be a Marvel rival.

4558
03:36:58,380 --> 03:36:58,720
Hello.

4559
03:36:59,020 --> 03:37:08,840
I think late night sniping is more cringe.

4560
03:37:09,060 --> 03:37:09,820
Because it's easier.

4561
03:37:10,180 --> 03:37:12,300
It's easier to snipe late at night.

4562
03:37:12,520 --> 03:37:13,620
Because there's less people playing.

4563
03:37:14,880 --> 03:37:16,520
But I want you guys to have your drops.

4564
03:37:16,820 --> 03:37:17,480
20 more seconds.

4565
03:37:18,540 --> 03:37:19,140
Yippee.

4566
03:37:20,760 --> 03:37:21,360
Yippee.

4567
03:37:22,940 --> 03:37:23,940
Fucking chill.

4568
03:37:26,260 --> 03:37:27,380
Yippee drops.

4569
03:37:28,200 --> 03:37:28,580
Yippee.

4570
03:37:28,740 --> 03:37:29,920
I'm going to play a bit off stream.

4571
03:37:30,020 --> 03:37:30,680
Because I do want to practice.

4572
03:37:30,700 --> 03:37:31,820
I feel like I didn't get enough practice.

4573
03:37:33,260 --> 03:37:34,520
Because I'm just like...

4574
03:37:34,520 --> 03:37:36,100
Elo terrorized right now.

4575
03:37:37,440 --> 03:37:38,200
I mean...

4576
03:37:38,200 --> 03:37:41,020
I feel like I'm getting elo terrorized.

4577
03:37:41,120 --> 03:37:42,660
So I'm not practicing as much.

4578
03:37:44,820 --> 03:37:46,060
I just want to get better.

4579
03:37:48,260 --> 03:37:48,640
Yippee.

4580
03:37:48,720 --> 03:37:48,980
Okay.

4581
03:37:52,180 --> 03:37:52,940
I'm done.

4582
03:37:53,780 --> 03:37:54,080
Alright.

4583
03:37:54,360 --> 03:37:55,100
I'm done.

4584
03:37:55,200 --> 03:37:56,960
I'm going to talk to chat.

4585
03:38:00,100 --> 03:38:00,740
Um.

4586
03:38:02,780 --> 03:38:03,420
Done.

4587
03:38:03,560 --> 03:38:05,220
I'm going to talk to chat.

4588
03:38:05,480 --> 03:38:06,520
For 30 minutes.

4589
03:38:06,860 --> 03:38:08,520
So they can get drops.

4590
03:38:09,840 --> 03:38:10,360
Uh.

4591
03:38:10,620 --> 03:38:11,780
Too much sniping.

4592
03:38:17,610 --> 03:38:18,250
Alright.

4593
03:38:20,730 --> 03:38:22,010
Playing against...

4594
03:38:22,010 --> 03:38:22,870
4 stacks.

4595
03:38:23,810 --> 03:38:24,250
Okay.

4596
03:38:24,970 --> 03:38:26,390
I don't mind if I have my own 4 stack.

4597
03:38:26,530 --> 03:38:27,710
But like, I'm fucking...

4598
03:38:27,710 --> 03:38:27,910
Alright.

4599
03:38:28,150 --> 03:38:29,290
It's chatting time.

4600
03:38:29,290 --> 03:38:29,990
Okay.

4601
03:38:30,630 --> 03:38:32,650
Chatting so you guys get drops.

4602
03:38:35,210 --> 03:38:35,730
Chatting...

4603
03:38:35,730 --> 03:38:36,710
So...

4604
03:38:36,710 --> 03:38:37,790
You guys...

4605
03:38:37,790 --> 03:38:38,710
Get drops.

4606
03:38:41,030 --> 03:38:43,270
I think like, at first we weren't getting sniped.

4607
03:38:43,350 --> 03:38:44,650
Because I just started my stream.

4608
03:38:45,670 --> 03:38:46,190
But...

4609
03:38:46,190 --> 03:38:47,570
As the night goes on...

4610
03:38:47,570 --> 03:38:48,970
It gets more and more obvious.

4611
03:38:56,900 --> 03:38:57,940
It just...

4612
03:38:57,940 --> 03:38:58,380
Like...

4613
03:38:58,380 --> 03:38:59,700
Because in the beginning...

4614
03:38:59,700 --> 03:39:01,240
In the beginning...

4615
03:39:01,240 --> 03:39:02,960
Things were a lot easier.

4616
03:39:03,320 --> 03:39:04,860
Because I felt so free.

4617
03:39:05,160 --> 03:39:06,700
To do whatever the fuck I want.

4618
03:39:06,900 --> 03:39:07,740
In the beginning.

4619
03:39:08,540 --> 03:39:09,180
And then...

4620
03:39:09,180 --> 03:39:10,500
And then...

4621
03:39:10,500 --> 03:39:11,240
As like...

4622
03:39:11,760 --> 03:39:12,500
As like...

4623
03:39:12,500 --> 03:39:13,460
Time...

4624
03:39:13,990 --> 03:39:14,880
As like...

4625
03:39:14,880 --> 03:39:16,700
It dragged on...

4626
03:39:16,700 --> 03:39:17,760
More and more.

4627
03:39:18,040 --> 03:39:19,420
I realized...

4628
03:39:19,420 --> 03:39:22,430
I realized things are...

4629
03:39:22,780 --> 03:39:25,200
Things were not going so well.

4630
03:39:25,440 --> 03:39:26,400
After that.

4631
03:39:28,840 --> 03:39:30,120
I think it was...

4632
03:39:30,120 --> 03:39:32,140
People noticed I was online too.

4633
03:39:32,840 --> 03:39:33,320
Because...

4634
03:39:33,320 --> 03:39:33,740
I...

4635
03:39:33,740 --> 03:39:35,360
You know, when I did the...

4636
03:39:35,360 --> 03:39:37,080
People noticed that...

4637
03:39:37,080 --> 03:39:38,520
I was online.

4638
03:39:38,920 --> 03:39:40,140
And it was just...

4639
03:39:40,140 --> 03:39:41,440
It was a little cringe.

4640
03:39:41,540 --> 03:39:42,220
Not gonna lie.

4641
03:39:42,480 --> 03:39:43,240
I do like...

4642
03:39:43,240 --> 03:39:44,080
Still like this game.

4643
03:39:44,320 --> 03:39:46,380
I don't find delay really fun.

4644
03:39:46,720 --> 03:39:47,780
I think like...

4645
03:39:47,780 --> 03:39:49,220
I think at this point...

4646
03:39:49,220 --> 03:39:50,120
I think it's solo...

4647
03:39:50,120 --> 03:39:50,580
I don't know.

4648
03:39:50,620 --> 03:39:52,280
I'm worried about solo queuing now.

4649
03:39:53,840 --> 03:39:54,320
Like...

4650
03:39:56,380 --> 03:39:56,860
It's...

4651
03:39:56,860 --> 03:39:58,040
It's also more...

4652
03:39:58,040 --> 03:39:59,320
It's also easier to...

4653
03:40:01,380 --> 03:40:03,040
Snipe late at night.

4654
03:40:03,340 --> 03:40:05,900
Because there's less people queuing.

4655
03:40:07,300 --> 03:40:08,080
So like...

4656
03:40:08,080 --> 03:40:10,400
There's not a lot of people that's high elo.

4657
03:40:11,280 --> 03:40:13,620
And because there's not a lot of people that's high elo.

4658
03:40:14,220 --> 03:40:15,400
You tend to match up.

4659
03:40:16,100 --> 03:40:18,680
You tend to match up with the same people.

4660
03:40:19,380 --> 03:40:20,720
Over and over again.

4661
03:40:21,720 --> 03:40:22,400
So...

4662
03:40:22,400 --> 03:40:23,380
So like...

4663
03:40:23,860 --> 03:40:25,240
It's easier to...

4664
03:40:26,720 --> 03:40:28,420
It's easier to like...

4665
03:40:28,420 --> 03:40:30,620
Get the person you want to play with.

4666
03:40:30,760 --> 03:40:31,340
Or against.

4667
03:40:31,740 --> 03:40:32,400
But like...

4668
03:40:32,400 --> 03:40:33,420
If I'm playing primetime.

4669
03:40:34,380 --> 03:40:35,440
Because like...

4670
03:40:35,440 --> 03:40:36,600
If I'm playing like...

4671
03:40:37,260 --> 03:40:37,900
On...

4672
03:40:38,420 --> 03:40:39,560
You know, earlier.

4673
03:40:39,940 --> 03:40:41,620
It's a lot more...

4674
03:40:41,620 --> 03:40:42,380
Difficult.

4675
03:40:43,480 --> 03:40:44,720
GM is not high elo.

4676
03:40:45,020 --> 03:40:45,660
I'm...

4677
03:40:45,660 --> 03:40:46,060
I...

4678
03:40:46,060 --> 03:40:47,280
I was...

4679
03:40:47,280 --> 03:40:49,260
I was at GM 1.

4680
03:40:49,680 --> 03:40:50,880
And then...

4681
03:40:50,880 --> 03:40:52,380
Things went downhill.

4682
03:40:55,360 --> 03:40:56,620
It's still high elo.

4683
03:40:56,740 --> 03:40:57,560
It's top of 100.

4684
03:40:57,560 --> 03:40:59,860
GM 1 is still top of...

4685
03:40:59,860 --> 03:41:01,320
Like, it's like top of 100.

4686
03:41:04,580 --> 03:41:05,140
Yeah.

4687
03:41:07,560 --> 03:41:08,120
And...

4688
03:41:08,120 --> 03:41:09,240
Yeah, so like...

4689
03:41:09,240 --> 03:41:09,720
I was...

4690
03:41:09,720 --> 03:41:10,120
It was...

4691
03:41:10,120 --> 03:41:10,800
It was rough.

4692
03:41:10,860 --> 03:41:11,640
It was so rough.

4693
03:41:13,300 --> 03:41:14,860
So that's why I was like...

4694
03:41:14,860 --> 03:41:15,520
Oh my god.

4695
03:41:15,760 --> 03:41:16,120
I was like...

4696
03:41:16,940 --> 03:41:18,820
I can't do this anymore.

4697
03:41:20,380 --> 03:41:22,560
This is too rough for me.

4698
03:41:23,060 --> 03:41:24,340
This is too rough.

4699
03:41:24,600 --> 03:41:25,740
And I felt like I wasn't getting...

4700
03:41:26,080 --> 03:41:26,820
Enough practice.

4701
03:41:26,820 --> 03:41:27,680
Going in.

4702
03:41:27,900 --> 03:41:30,040
Because I just wanted to practice for the tournament.

4703
03:41:30,500 --> 03:41:32,000
I just want to get better for...

4704
03:41:33,720 --> 03:41:35,700
For the tournament on Saturday.

4705
03:41:36,200 --> 03:41:36,880
So yeah.

4706
03:41:37,060 --> 03:41:37,620
I might practice...

4707
03:41:37,620 --> 03:41:39,280
I want to practice more off stream though.

4708
03:41:39,340 --> 03:41:41,020
I'm not going to play for too long.

4709
03:41:41,360 --> 03:41:42,960
I just want to...

4710
03:41:42,960 --> 03:41:44,660
I used to solo queue.

4711
03:41:45,160 --> 03:41:46,040
But like...

4712
03:41:46,040 --> 03:41:48,000
I don't do it on stream anymore.

4713
03:41:48,540 --> 03:41:49,900
Because like...

4714
03:41:49,900 --> 03:41:50,820
People were purposely...

4715
03:41:52,160 --> 03:41:53,400
Queue sniping me.

4716
03:41:53,540 --> 03:41:55,420
When I was streaming on Twitch.

4717
03:41:55,420 --> 03:41:57,380
I did it on YouTube.

4718
03:41:57,640 --> 03:41:58,340
Because like...

4719
03:41:58,340 --> 03:42:00,620
Nobody knew I existed on solo...

4720
03:42:02,640 --> 03:42:05,600
Nobody knew I existed on YouTube.

4721
03:42:06,000 --> 03:42:08,720
So I could get away solo queuing.

4722
03:42:09,360 --> 03:42:11,620
But now that I'm on Twitch.

4723
03:42:11,700 --> 03:42:13,600
I can't get away with it anymore.

4724
03:42:17,500 --> 03:42:18,260
So...

4725
03:42:18,260 --> 03:42:19,620
So like...

4726
03:42:19,620 --> 03:42:20,660
It's just...

4727
03:42:20,660 --> 03:42:22,620
Better for my mental.

4728
03:42:23,000 --> 03:42:24,220
To not solo queue.

4729
03:42:24,220 --> 03:42:25,960
If I'm streaming on Twitch.

4730
03:42:29,440 --> 03:42:31,300
Shouldn't I practice my other support?

4731
03:42:31,720 --> 03:42:33,240
She's gold right now.

4732
03:42:33,600 --> 03:42:34,620
Is she gold?

4733
03:42:34,700 --> 03:42:35,700
She's gold right now.

4734
03:42:35,720 --> 03:42:37,440
I mean she has to be maximum plat.

4735
03:42:37,940 --> 03:42:39,580
I feel better if I practice...

4736
03:42:39,580 --> 03:42:41,480
I don't feel like I'm going to get much practice.

4737
03:42:41,480 --> 03:42:42,880
In gold plat elo.

4738
03:42:43,340 --> 03:42:44,600
I feel like it'd be better.

4739
03:42:44,740 --> 03:42:46,400
If I practice with her in a scrim.

4740
03:42:46,980 --> 03:42:47,420
Because...

4741
03:42:47,420 --> 03:42:50,080
I don't think I'm going to get much practice.

4742
03:42:52,300 --> 03:42:55,060
Much practice doing gold plat lobbies.

4743
03:42:55,240 --> 03:42:56,480
Because it's very easy.

4744
03:43:00,980 --> 03:43:01,440
Yeah.

4745
03:43:01,940 --> 03:43:04,660
And I just want to practice what I'm playing for in the tournament.

4746
03:43:04,820 --> 03:43:07,000
Because she's going to play Cloak and Dagger.

4747
03:43:07,180 --> 03:43:08,800
And I really don't want to play Cloak and Dagger.

4748
03:43:09,680 --> 03:43:11,520
I don't want to play Cloak and Dagger right now.

4749
03:43:11,580 --> 03:43:12,520
Because I'm not...

4750
03:43:12,520 --> 03:43:13,900
I don't need to...

4751
03:43:13,900 --> 03:43:15,080
I don't need to like...

4752
03:43:16,640 --> 03:43:18,240
Play her right now.

4753
03:43:19,720 --> 03:43:20,680
Hope games can...

4754
03:43:20,680 --> 03:43:21,340
I hope so too.

4755
03:43:21,400 --> 03:43:23,100
I just want to practice Luna.

4756
03:43:23,620 --> 03:43:25,420
I just want to practice her more and...

4757
03:43:27,240 --> 03:43:28,980
Practice her freezes and stuff.

4758
03:43:29,500 --> 03:43:31,040
Fistful, thank you for the 100 bitties.

4759
03:43:31,100 --> 03:43:32,020
Thank you, thank you.

4760
03:43:32,320 --> 03:43:33,780
And thank you for the Twitch Prime.

4761
03:43:33,900 --> 03:43:36,880
I think this has been my roughest ranked session on stream.

4762
03:43:42,040 --> 03:43:45,540
This has definitely been my roughest ranked session.

4763
03:43:45,540 --> 03:43:48,540
But I also think that everyone is now...

4764
03:43:50,260 --> 03:43:52,920
I was at a point where everyone...

4765
03:43:52,920 --> 03:43:54,700
I kept bumping into the stackers.

4766
03:43:59,580 --> 03:44:01,600
Billy, thank you for the gifted subs.

4767
03:44:01,740 --> 03:44:02,100
Thank you, thank you.

4768
03:44:02,100 --> 03:44:03,920
Nexy, thank you for the 10 gifted subs.

4769
03:44:04,040 --> 03:44:05,200
Thank you, thank you.

4770
03:44:05,600 --> 03:44:06,820
I really appreciate it.

4771
03:44:07,040 --> 03:44:08,140
No, I'm pretty sure the...

4772
03:44:08,140 --> 03:44:09,380
I saw a lot of teams.

4773
03:44:10,380 --> 03:44:14,220
I saw a lot of teams that were running...

4774
03:44:14,220 --> 03:44:20,340
That are practicing Groot and Moon Knight.

4775
03:44:21,580 --> 03:44:22,720
In general.

4776
03:44:22,900 --> 03:44:27,400
Some teams have started streaming their practices.

4777
03:44:30,200 --> 03:44:32,040
Some teams started streaming their practices.

4778
03:44:32,280 --> 03:44:35,120
And they were basically practicing Groot and Moon Knight.

4779
03:44:35,120 --> 03:44:37,390
I hope my...

4780
03:44:37,740 --> 03:44:38,450
I honestly...

4781
03:44:39,120 --> 03:44:40,800
I'm gonna ban Groot.

4782
03:44:40,960 --> 03:44:41,400
I think.

4783
03:44:41,780 --> 03:44:42,480
I can't.

4784
03:44:42,480 --> 03:44:43,280
I cannot deal with...

4785
03:44:43,280 --> 03:44:45,040
That combo is so oppressive.

4786
03:44:45,420 --> 03:44:46,460
It's just not fun.

4787
03:44:47,700 --> 03:44:51,340
That's the only team comp...

4788
03:44:51,340 --> 03:44:54,500
That legitimately just don't have fun playing against.

4789
03:44:55,200 --> 03:44:57,180
I love Marble Rivals.

4790
03:44:57,640 --> 03:44:59,160
But that actually kills my...

4791
03:44:59,160 --> 03:45:03,320
It actually kills my enjoyment of Marble Rivals.

4792
03:45:03,320 --> 03:45:05,320
Because there's no counterplay.

4793
03:45:05,800 --> 03:45:08,340
It just sucks when there's no counterplay.

4794
03:45:08,540 --> 03:45:10,660
I wish there was.

4795
03:45:11,220 --> 03:45:15,520
If there was at least one counterplay...

4796
03:45:15,520 --> 03:45:16,480
I'd be happy.

4797
03:45:16,860 --> 03:45:18,340
But there isn't.

4798
03:45:21,040 --> 03:45:23,900
The only counterplay is like...

4799
03:45:23,900 --> 03:45:24,740
We split up.

4800
03:45:24,900 --> 03:45:27,620
And I'm like, what the...

4801
03:45:28,320 --> 03:45:30,820
What kind of counterplay is that?

4802
03:45:30,820 --> 03:45:33,140
Just split up everyone.

4803
03:45:33,920 --> 03:45:35,680
Just split up.

4804
03:45:36,120 --> 03:45:38,340
What kind of counterplay is that?

4805
03:45:39,120 --> 03:45:41,840
Aren't they people that are gifting a tier 1 sub?

4806
03:45:43,980 --> 03:45:45,440
No, it doesn't.

4807
03:45:45,460 --> 03:45:47,020
It doesn't absorb it.

4808
03:45:48,020 --> 03:45:49,940
It's just not...

4809
03:45:49,940 --> 03:45:51,780
It's just one count...

4810
03:45:51,780 --> 03:45:52,400
Oh my god.

4811
03:45:52,440 --> 03:45:55,140
Let them kill us one by one instead.

4812
03:45:56,180 --> 03:45:57,700
Just split up everyone.

4813
03:45:57,800 --> 03:45:58,840
Split up gang.

4814
03:46:03,640 --> 03:46:04,540
Or maybe...

4815
03:46:04,540 --> 03:46:05,180
I hope maybe.

4816
03:46:05,300 --> 03:46:06,960
I hope maybe the new heroes...

4817
03:46:06,960 --> 03:46:09,260
The new heroes will...

4818
03:46:09,260 --> 03:46:12,660
Have some sort of counterplay to it.

4819
03:46:13,420 --> 03:46:13,940
Maybe...

4820
03:46:13,940 --> 03:46:17,800
Maybe Professor Xavier can fucking kill Groot with his mind.

4821
03:46:17,900 --> 03:46:18,440
I don't know.

4822
03:46:18,900 --> 03:46:21,040
Maybe his ult is just that he stops...

4823
03:46:21,040 --> 03:46:23,340
Like he just stops him from ulting.

4824
03:46:27,180 --> 03:46:28,380
Nerf the Groot walls.

4825
03:46:28,900 --> 03:46:29,540
I don't know.

4826
03:46:29,720 --> 03:46:30,520
It's so...

4827
03:46:30,520 --> 03:46:31,560
It's just...

4828
03:46:31,560 --> 03:46:32,780
I wish it was less oppressive.

4829
03:46:33,200 --> 03:46:33,940
That's for sure.

4830
03:46:34,220 --> 03:46:35,960
I don't really care about losing ELO.

4831
03:46:36,100 --> 03:46:37,000
Because like...

4832
03:46:37,000 --> 03:46:38,740
Guys, I don't know if you guys know this.

4833
03:46:39,260 --> 03:46:39,820
But...

4834
03:46:39,820 --> 03:46:42,560
There's 85 days of the season.

4835
03:46:42,760 --> 03:46:43,680
So I like...

4836
03:46:43,680 --> 03:46:44,480
I don't care.

4837
03:46:46,880 --> 03:46:49,660
But I'm not getting enough practice.

4838
03:46:50,000 --> 03:46:52,480
Like there's 85 days.

4839
03:46:53,360 --> 03:46:53,920
There's...

4840
03:47:02,640 --> 03:47:03,280
Uh...

4841
03:47:03,280 --> 03:47:04,100
So yeah.

4842
03:47:04,280 --> 03:47:05,120
It's like...

4843
03:47:05,120 --> 03:47:07,920
There's way too many days to play this game.

4844
03:47:11,520 --> 03:47:12,800
So like...

4845
03:47:12,800 --> 03:47:13,520
It doesn't...

4846
03:47:14,080 --> 03:47:16,440
It really...

4847
03:47:16,440 --> 03:47:17,160
I don't know.

4848
03:47:17,280 --> 03:47:19,040
I don't think seasons should be this long.

4849
03:47:19,260 --> 03:47:20,340
I don't know.

4850
03:47:20,700 --> 03:47:22,440
I don't know.

4851
03:47:22,560 --> 03:47:26,580
I feel like 85 days is way too fucking long.

4852
03:47:31,780 --> 03:47:32,180
Um...

4853
03:47:32,640 --> 03:47:33,040
Um...

4854
03:47:33,040 --> 03:47:33,320
Yeah.

4855
03:47:33,520 --> 03:47:34,040
I don't know.

4856
03:47:34,140 --> 03:47:35,680
I feel like...

4857
03:47:35,680 --> 03:47:37,160
One and a half is good.

4858
03:47:37,280 --> 03:47:38,140
One and a half or two.

4859
03:47:38,960 --> 03:47:39,360
Um...

4860
03:47:39,360 --> 03:47:40,400
Three months is way too...

4861
03:47:40,400 --> 03:47:40,540
No.

4862
03:47:40,620 --> 03:47:41,720
Three months is way too long.

4863
03:47:41,780 --> 03:47:43,220
Especially for like...

4864
03:47:43,220 --> 03:47:44,280
Because like...

4865
03:47:44,280 --> 03:47:46,360
If you want to be on the leaderboards.

4866
03:47:46,640 --> 03:47:47,180
You just got...

4867
03:47:47,180 --> 03:47:48,060
You have to play.

4868
03:47:48,580 --> 03:47:50,020
You can't stop playing.

4869
03:47:50,980 --> 03:47:51,600
That's the thing.

4870
03:47:51,740 --> 03:47:52,400
You literally...

4871
03:47:52,400 --> 03:47:53,400
If you stop...

4872
03:47:53,400 --> 03:47:55,320
I didn't play for a day and a half.

4873
03:47:55,420 --> 03:47:58,360
And I dropped 150 points.

4874
03:47:58,360 --> 03:48:01,600
Like, I dropped 150 placements.

4875
03:48:02,820 --> 03:48:03,300
Um...

4876
03:48:03,300 --> 03:48:05,200
Because I didn't play for...

4877
03:48:05,200 --> 03:48:06,260
Not even a day and a half.

4878
03:48:06,380 --> 03:48:07,700
It was like almost two days.

4879
03:48:07,800 --> 03:48:09,140
I didn't play for almost two days.

4880
03:48:09,360 --> 03:48:10,300
No, a day and a half.

4881
03:48:10,340 --> 03:48:12,660
And I dropped 150 placements.

4882
03:48:13,700 --> 03:48:14,180
And...

4883
03:48:15,540 --> 03:48:16,020
Um...

4884
03:48:16,020 --> 03:48:16,740
And like...

4885
03:48:16,740 --> 03:48:18,020
I can't play every day.

4886
03:48:18,160 --> 03:48:18,880
I have...

4887
03:48:18,880 --> 03:48:21,200
I have so much more responsibilities.

4888
03:48:22,000 --> 03:48:22,800
This month...

4889
03:48:22,800 --> 03:48:24,340
Next month, I'll be really busy.

4890
03:48:24,840 --> 03:48:26,780
I'll be really busy next month.

4891
03:48:26,860 --> 03:48:27,600
And then...

4892
03:48:27,600 --> 03:48:28,440
This month, too.

4893
03:48:28,500 --> 03:48:29,260
Because I need a...

4894
03:48:29,260 --> 03:48:29,740
I need a plan.

4895
03:48:29,840 --> 03:48:32,240
I have so much stuff going on behind the scenes.

4896
03:48:32,480 --> 03:48:33,000
So...

4897
03:48:33,000 --> 03:48:36,640
I just don't have a lot of time to play.

4898
03:48:36,700 --> 03:48:37,060
I don't know.

4899
03:48:37,320 --> 03:48:38,600
I heard that...

4900
03:48:39,180 --> 03:48:41,280
I'm not sure if it's fully confirmed.

4901
03:48:41,940 --> 03:48:42,920
But like...

4902
03:48:42,920 --> 03:48:45,600
I asked some pros to ask the devs.

4903
03:48:45,760 --> 03:48:50,140
And they said there's no plans currently to have a leaderboard record.

4904
03:48:51,280 --> 03:48:51,800
Um...

4905
03:48:52,420 --> 03:48:52,940
For...

4906
03:48:52,940 --> 03:48:53,780
Uh...

4907
03:48:53,780 --> 03:48:54,720
For Season 1.

4908
03:48:55,140 --> 03:48:56,400
So I'm like, what's the point?

4909
03:48:56,400 --> 03:48:57,160
LOL

4910
03:49:00,540 --> 03:49:02,360
Like, it's gonna be on a website.

4911
03:49:02,480 --> 03:49:03,820
Who the fuck looks up our website?

4912
03:49:04,660 --> 03:49:06,820
Like, I'd rather be able to see the leaderboard.

4913
03:49:07,700 --> 03:49:08,100
Um...

4914
03:49:08,100 --> 03:49:09,120
I'd rather...

4915
03:49:09,120 --> 03:49:11,820
We'd be able to see the leaderboard, like...

4916
03:49:12,460 --> 03:49:12,860
Um...

4917
03:49:12,860 --> 03:49:13,300
On the...

4918
03:49:13,300 --> 03:49:14,040
In the game.

4919
03:49:14,620 --> 03:49:15,400
So I'm like...

4920
03:49:15,920 --> 03:49:16,320
I don't know.

4921
03:49:16,360 --> 03:49:17,260
I think that's so stupid.

4922
03:49:17,540 --> 03:49:18,280
That really is.

4923
03:49:20,380 --> 03:49:20,780
Um...

4924
03:49:21,460 --> 03:49:21,860
Um...

4925
03:49:21,860 --> 03:49:23,020
I don't understand, too.

4926
03:49:23,180 --> 03:49:23,840
I don't understand.

4927
03:49:23,840 --> 03:49:24,980
I don't understand.

4928
03:49:25,100 --> 03:49:27,840
I don't understand why we can't look at the history of...

4929
03:49:28,820 --> 03:49:29,300
Uh...

4930
03:49:29,300 --> 03:49:31,760
The history of, like, past...

4931
03:49:31,760 --> 03:49:32,660
Like, of, like...

4932
03:49:32,660 --> 03:49:34,540
You know, previous Top 500s.

4933
03:49:34,560 --> 03:49:35,620
Cause I feel like...

4934
03:49:35,620 --> 03:49:37,820
It's just so easy to implement in general.

4935
03:49:38,280 --> 03:49:39,120
And, like...

4936
03:49:39,120 --> 03:49:42,160
I feel like that's the biggest reason to...

4937
03:49:43,000 --> 03:49:43,480
Uh...

4938
03:49:43,480 --> 03:49:44,900
Have it...

4939
03:49:44,900 --> 03:49:45,740
In the game.

4940
03:49:45,820 --> 03:49:47,340
Cause every game has that.

4941
03:49:47,480 --> 03:49:47,860
Like...

4942
03:49:47,860 --> 03:49:48,800
Okay, except for Apex.

4943
03:49:49,060 --> 03:49:49,540
But...

4944
03:49:49,540 --> 03:49:51,900
Apex, at least the badges are much more worth it.

4945
03:49:51,900 --> 03:49:53,700
And the badges say what rank you were.

4946
03:49:54,120 --> 03:49:55,400
At least, like, Apex badges.

4947
03:49:55,620 --> 03:49:56,960
You can see what rank you are.

4948
03:49:57,380 --> 03:49:58,400
And you get to have, like...

4949
03:49:58,400 --> 03:50:00,720
You know, your badge is not fucking tiny as hell.

4950
03:50:01,060 --> 03:50:02,900
Like, the size of a fucking ant.

4951
03:50:03,860 --> 03:50:04,300
Like...

4952
03:50:05,580 --> 03:50:06,460
At least...

4953
03:50:06,460 --> 03:50:09,840
At least the badge is not the size of an ant.

4954
03:50:11,080 --> 03:50:11,960
And, like...

4955
03:50:11,960 --> 03:50:12,340
Um...

4956
03:50:12,340 --> 03:50:13,380
Overwatch has...

4957
03:50:13,380 --> 03:50:13,620
Yeah.

4958
03:50:14,040 --> 03:50:16,240
Overwatch has the public leaderboards.

4959
03:50:16,440 --> 03:50:17,900
Which I could, like, flex and be like...

4960
03:50:17,900 --> 03:50:18,280
Hey, guys.

4961
03:50:18,300 --> 03:50:18,960
Look at this.

4962
03:50:19,500 --> 03:50:19,940
Look.

4963
03:50:19,940 --> 03:50:21,340
This is where...

4964
03:50:21,340 --> 03:50:22,940
This is where I have...

4965
03:50:22,940 --> 03:50:25,060
This is my rank right here.

4966
03:50:25,160 --> 03:50:26,800
This is me on the leaderboard.

4967
03:50:27,200 --> 03:50:28,040
That's right.

4968
03:50:31,600 --> 03:50:34,120
I didn't even get a screenshot where I ended.

4969
03:50:34,500 --> 03:50:35,580
I know you guys did.

4970
03:50:35,720 --> 03:50:36,760
But, like, I was sleeping.

4971
03:50:37,240 --> 03:50:38,940
Cause I didn't know that...

4972
03:50:39,800 --> 03:50:41,060
Like, you see this right here?

4973
03:50:41,180 --> 03:50:42,880
That's my top 500 badge.

4974
03:50:43,340 --> 03:50:44,240
If you guys are curious.

4975
03:50:45,820 --> 03:50:46,260
Like...

4976
03:50:47,120 --> 03:50:48,280
That's what it is.

4977
03:50:49,940 --> 03:50:50,340
Oh, wait.

4978
03:50:50,420 --> 03:50:51,300
You guys don't see it.

4979
03:50:51,520 --> 03:50:52,420
You see that here?

4980
03:50:53,120 --> 03:50:54,680
That's my top 500 badge.

4981
03:50:56,700 --> 03:50:58,640
That gold thing right here?

4982
03:50:59,120 --> 03:51:01,240
That's my top 500 badge.

4983
03:51:01,340 --> 03:51:05,100
And that's the only way you know I was top 500.

4984
03:51:08,660 --> 03:51:09,680
It's right here.

4985
03:51:10,460 --> 03:51:11,100
It's...

4986
03:51:11,100 --> 03:51:11,560
It's...

4987
03:51:11,560 --> 03:51:12,380
It's this.

4988
03:51:12,700 --> 03:51:13,700
It's this here.

4989
03:51:14,200 --> 03:51:15,440
So, I'm like...

4990
03:51:15,440 --> 03:51:17,020
I'm like, what's the point?

4991
03:51:17,980 --> 03:51:18,880
What's the point?

4992
03:51:20,500 --> 03:51:21,960
I hope they have a...

4993
03:51:22,880 --> 03:51:25,320
I hope they have, like, a...

4994
03:51:25,320 --> 03:51:25,820
I don't know.

4995
03:51:25,880 --> 03:51:27,020
I hope they implement it.

4996
03:51:27,160 --> 03:51:30,160
If they do implement it in Season 1, then maybe I'll think about it.

4997
03:51:30,180 --> 03:51:31,820
But for now, I don't really care too much.

4998
03:51:31,940 --> 03:51:33,540
I don't really care too much about the leaderboard.

4999
03:51:33,660 --> 03:51:34,720
I just wanna get better.

5000
03:51:35,480 --> 03:51:37,860
I legitimately just wanna get better at the game.

5001
03:51:38,780 --> 03:51:41,680
For rivals, because I like being a good player.

5002
03:51:42,400 --> 03:51:44,560
And, like, I like improving and stuff.

5003
03:51:44,940 --> 03:51:49,100
I feel like it's so hard to improve when you have, like, a target on your back.

5004
03:51:52,620 --> 03:51:53,280
Now...

5005
03:51:53,280 --> 03:51:56,260
Now I know how xQc felt when...

5006
03:51:56,260 --> 03:51:57,680
Oh my god.

5007
03:51:58,180 --> 03:51:58,460
Bro.

5008
03:51:59,060 --> 03:52:00,660
But no one's getting paid.

5009
03:52:01,280 --> 03:52:03,560
I'm pretty sure nobody's getting...

5010
03:52:03,560 --> 03:52:05,940
None of the fucking snipers are getting paid.

5011
03:52:06,360 --> 03:52:07,600
It's just hate.

5012
03:52:09,300 --> 03:52:10,460
At least get...

5013
03:52:10,460 --> 03:52:11,160
At least I...

5014
03:52:11,160 --> 03:52:13,320
I wish the snipers got paid.

5015
03:52:13,700 --> 03:52:14,340
Like...

5016
03:52:14,340 --> 03:52:18,780
Like, that's not fair.

5017
03:52:18,780 --> 03:52:21,060
xQc snipers get paid?

5018
03:52:21,480 --> 03:52:23,740
Why can't my snipers get paid?

5019
03:52:24,040 --> 03:52:25,600
That's not fair.

5020
03:52:30,140 --> 03:52:32,780
Oh my god.

5021
03:52:36,520 --> 03:52:37,960
No, okay.

5022
03:52:38,040 --> 03:52:40,780
So what happened to xQc was that...

5023
03:52:41,660 --> 03:52:43,060
Was that...

5024
03:52:45,240 --> 03:52:46,280
Basically...

5025
03:52:47,720 --> 03:52:48,760
They...

5026
03:52:48,760 --> 03:52:50,780
Chatters were paying players in...

5027
03:52:52,640 --> 03:52:54,760
Chatters were paying snipers...

5028
03:52:55,540 --> 03:52:58,740
Or, like, players in Marvel Rivals...

5029
03:52:58,740 --> 03:53:02,320
To purposely queue snipe xQc at one point.

5030
03:53:02,800 --> 03:53:05,900
And, like, either throw his games or, like...

5031
03:53:05,900 --> 03:53:08,280
Try extremely hard against him.

5032
03:53:08,560 --> 03:53:10,800
Or, like, get on a smurf account to, like...

5033
03:53:11,500 --> 03:53:14,160
To, like, purposely, like...

5034
03:53:14,620 --> 03:53:16,860
Fuck with his games or, like...

5035
03:53:18,340 --> 03:53:19,220
Or, like...

5036
03:53:19,220 --> 03:53:20,900
Make sure he lose and stuff.

5037
03:53:21,000 --> 03:53:22,860
So, it was, like, it's crazy.

5038
03:53:23,980 --> 03:53:24,420
And...

5039
03:53:24,420 --> 03:53:25,920
But at least they got paid!

5040
03:53:30,250 --> 03:53:30,670
At least...

5041
03:53:31,630 --> 03:53:34,010
Guys, if you're gonna snipe me, get paid.

5042
03:53:34,150 --> 03:53:36,010
I hope you guys get paid for it.

5043
03:53:36,050 --> 03:53:36,530
I hope...

5044
03:53:37,050 --> 03:53:38,330
So you don't...

5045
03:53:38,330 --> 03:53:40,910
I really hope you guys get paid for it.

5046
03:53:40,950 --> 03:53:43,290
Because, like, that makes me feel a lot better.

5047
03:53:43,490 --> 03:53:43,890
You know?

5048
03:53:43,970 --> 03:53:44,790
That makes me feel...

5049
03:53:44,790 --> 03:53:46,910
Because at least I'm making money running ads.

5050
03:53:47,250 --> 03:53:47,690
Like...

5051
03:53:50,550 --> 03:53:51,590
At least...

5052
03:53:51,590 --> 03:53:52,790
At least I...

5053
03:53:53,480 --> 03:53:55,690
At least I got money running...

5054
03:53:55,690 --> 03:53:56,470
Wait, what?

5055
03:53:56,690 --> 03:53:57,810
Oh, wait.

5056
03:53:57,950 --> 03:53:58,610
Okay, no.

5057
03:53:59,650 --> 03:54:03,970
That's all I want for you guys.

5058
03:54:04,230 --> 03:54:06,090
I hope you guys get paid.

5059
03:54:06,250 --> 03:54:08,410
Because then it would mean so much more.

5060
03:54:08,790 --> 03:54:11,270
It would mean so much more.

5061
03:54:18,150 --> 03:54:19,190
I only...

5062
03:54:19,190 --> 03:54:19,670
Exactly!

5063
03:54:19,810 --> 03:54:22,410
I only want hired assassins!

5064
03:54:22,510 --> 03:54:23,850
If you're gonna try...

5065
03:54:23,850 --> 03:54:25,190
If you're gonna target me.

5066
03:54:25,290 --> 03:54:28,530
I only want people who get hired to kill me.

5067
03:54:28,710 --> 03:54:29,910
Or throw my games.

5068
03:54:37,290 --> 03:54:39,450
This has been the roughest session.

5069
03:54:39,870 --> 03:54:40,590
This has been.

5070
03:54:40,690 --> 03:54:41,350
This is why...

5071
03:54:41,350 --> 03:54:43,090
I would've gotten off earlier.

5072
03:54:44,070 --> 03:54:46,190
But I decided to...

5073
03:54:46,990 --> 03:54:47,550
To...

5074
03:54:48,890 --> 03:54:50,950
Do it for free.

5075
03:54:54,610 --> 03:54:56,530
I wanted to get off earlier.

5076
03:54:56,770 --> 03:54:58,230
But I decided to stay longer.

5077
03:54:58,470 --> 03:55:00,570
Because I heard you guys...

5078
03:55:00,570 --> 03:55:02,190
I know you guys wanted...

5079
03:55:02,910 --> 03:55:03,970
There's the drops.

5080
03:55:04,170 --> 03:55:06,090
And like 4 hours is apparently the max.

5081
03:55:06,450 --> 03:55:07,250
So like...

5082
03:55:07,250 --> 03:55:09,930
I'm sorry if you guys watch the stream...

5083
03:55:09,930 --> 03:55:10,350
You know what?

5084
03:55:10,410 --> 03:55:10,690
Okay.

5085
03:55:10,810 --> 03:55:12,290
I'll stop at 4 hours.

5086
03:55:12,630 --> 03:55:14,730
But let the ending screen play.

5087
03:55:14,730 --> 03:55:17,130
For like an extra 5 minutes.

5088
03:55:17,170 --> 03:55:17,890
So like...

5089
03:55:17,890 --> 03:55:19,510
If you came in 5 minutes late.

5090
03:55:20,070 --> 03:55:20,990
I'm sorry.

5091
03:55:21,170 --> 03:55:21,470
Like...

5092
03:55:21,470 --> 03:55:22,510
I'm so sorry.

5093
03:55:22,610 --> 03:55:23,290
I guess you guys are watching.

5094
03:55:23,590 --> 03:55:24,230
I'm streaming.

5095
03:55:26,850 --> 03:55:29,090
Wait, when did drops end?

5096
03:55:29,390 --> 03:55:29,690
Chat?

5097
03:55:30,670 --> 03:55:30,970
Like...

5098
03:55:33,350 --> 03:55:35,530
When does the drops end?

5099
03:55:37,430 --> 03:55:38,510
If I came in...

5100
03:55:38,510 --> 03:55:39,330
Oh, it's 26.

5101
03:55:39,530 --> 03:55:40,130
Fucking...

5102
03:55:40,130 --> 03:55:40,690
Goodbye.

5103
03:55:41,710 --> 03:55:42,790
I'll be streaming...

5104
03:55:43,370 --> 03:55:44,090
Oh my god.

5105
03:55:44,090 --> 03:55:45,390
I should've read when it ends.

5106
03:55:45,490 --> 03:55:46,470
I could've ended earlier.

5107
03:55:46,770 --> 03:55:47,430
Oh my god.

5108
03:55:47,510 --> 03:55:49,650
I will be streaming on Twitch on Saturday, guys.

5109
03:55:50,030 --> 03:55:50,910
Goodbye, everybody.
