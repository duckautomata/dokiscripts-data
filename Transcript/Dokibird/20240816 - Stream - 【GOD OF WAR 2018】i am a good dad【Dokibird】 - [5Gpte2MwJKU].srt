1
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,740
Hello everybody!

2
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,140
So like, there was not really a reason for me to loop.

3
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,220
I was like, ready and everything.

4
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,460
I just wanted, I just wanted my coffee to kick in.

5
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,820
I just, I just wanted my coffee to kick in.

6
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,760
So I was just like, you know what?

7
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,780
We're just gonna loop a little bit.

8
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:14,860
Uh, I took a, um, okay, so like, uh, by the way, I haven't had my sound, the acoustic whatever shit installed yet.

9
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,520
Um, because I'm still waiting from Amazon.

10
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,180
I don't know, I think it, let me check if it's delivered already.

11
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:30,080
Uh, cause I did have to walk dad, uh, I did have to walk dad a little earlier, so like, I need to check that.

12
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,120
Let me double check if it's here.

13
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,760
I was, I was gonna check it.

14
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,340
I was gonna check it earlier, but then I was like, eh.

15
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,460
I was like, eh.

16
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,460
Oh shit!

17
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,120
Okay, nevermind, it has arrived.

18
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,400
Okay, I'll pick it up.

19
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,600
I'll pick it up like, uh, after this stream.

20
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,980
Um, I'm just tired.

21
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,220
I'm just tired.

22
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,220
Um, so yeah, uh, fuck, what was it?

23
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:00,660
Oh yes!

24
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,000
World update.

25
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:13,120
There's no, like, personal news update because really there's nothing to update you about what's going on right now to me because I'm still, I'm still unpacked.

26
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:13,560
Are you okay?

27
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,100
No.

28
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,700
Like I said, I'm waiting for the coffee to kick in.

29
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,980
I was like, it was like, um, I like ate, uh, dinner.

30
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:29,560
I ate, like, dinner at, uh, mmm, at 3pm because I was like, oh man.

31
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,880
I don't want to eat dinner after the stream.

32
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:33,980
I'll just eat dinner now.

33
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,740
And then, you know, after you eat dinner, like your quote unquote dinner.

34
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:47,160
Um, it's because I ate breakfast and usually I don't eat breakfast, but like I woke up early today and ate breakfast at like, uh, 10am.

35
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,040
So then I was like, alright, I'm going to eat dinner at 3.

36
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:58,000
Um, and then, you know, I was like, should I, should I like be productive and do work?

37
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,720
Or take a one hour nap?

38
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:10,280
And as you all know, um, I think you can guess which one I chose.

39
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:20,600
So, so I decided to take that one hour nap because it looked so appetizing.

40
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:27,900
I was like, ah, clearly, you know, a one hour nap is not going to fuck me over mentally.

41
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,120
I'm not going to feel like I want to, I'm not going to feel like that.

42
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,040
I want to die inside.

43
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:41,280
So like, you know, not like I'll be like this time, this nap will be different.

44
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,140
This nap will be so different.

45
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,540
I'll feel so much energy and I will.

46
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:56,880
I have so much energy after the nap and I'll feel so restful and I'll be so fucking ready.

47
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,840
And yeah, so I was not ready.

48
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,940
I was, I was not ready.

49
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:13,600
Um, but yes, I, my brain is still, the cog wheels are still turning very slow right now.

50
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:18,240
So, um, I don't know how words work anymore right at the moment.

51
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,620
And I'm like, I can't really form sentences at the moment.

52
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:26,520
Um, but yes, if, if like you have something important to do.

53
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,500
And you're like, do I take a nap?

54
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,260
You do not take the nap.

55
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,680
Do not nap.

56
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,240
I don't know.

57
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,700
I keep telling you guys this, but I never listened to myself.

58
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:39,340
Like the amount of times I'll be like, don't worry guys.

59
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,660
I'll never take a nap before stream again.

60
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,460
And I still do it.

61
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,420
It doesn't...

62
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:50,120
I, why do I still do it?

63
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,720
Doki, this time, this time will be different.

64
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:58,460
Doki, this time you won't take that nap before your stream.

65
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,520
It doesn't matter.

66
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,520
You literally have one hour before your stream, Doki.

67
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,220
Don't you fucking dare.

68
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,000
But like, I never learned.

69
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,140
I'll be like, no, no.

70
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,540
This nap will be different.

71
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,100
Doki, you don't understand.

72
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,740
This is the one day that like your brain is suddenly gonna like rewire itself.

73
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,960
And you're gonna have like the perfect REM sleep schedule.

74
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,160
Where you're gonna wake up at the exact cycle of your REM sleep.

75
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,680
Where like you'll feel so much energy.

76
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,400
Uh...

77
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,240
So it's up.

78
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,360
I'll be like, this time it'll be different.

79
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,340
Anyway.

80
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,140
World update.

81
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,680
Cause I wanna talk about world news.

82
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,460
As in like Twitter news.

83
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,020
Um, did you guys see...

84
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,420
Did you guys...

85
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:52,100
Okay, you guys all know about like the strip, the break dancing shit in the Olympics, right?

86
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,420
I just, I saw this on my timeline today.

87
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,020
So like...

88
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,440
You guys all know about like the infamous...

89
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,380
Did you know break dancing was only for...

90
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,000
Was only brought into Olympics like this year?

91
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,420
That's so fucked.

92
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,020
And because of what Australia did...

93
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,320
It's not gonna be next...

94
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,280
It's not gonna be in next Olympics.

95
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,640
It's so...

96
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,080
It's so fucked.

97
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,960
It's really the first time break dancing was ever in the Olympics.

98
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,220
And because of Australia...

99
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,660
Because of Australia...

100
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,600
They were like, nevermind.

101
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,720
We are gonna remove break dancing from the Olympics.

102
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,120
And then it got so bad.

103
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,940
It got so bad.

104
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,520
There's a criminal...

105
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:37,860
There's an...

106
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,580
There's an actual criminal investigation right now.

107
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:47,060
Cause they were like, how the fuck did this person qualify into the Olympics?

108
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,960
Cause you know, all the countries gotta qualify first.

109
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,700
Before they get into the Olympic, Olympic broadcast part.

110
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,960
Cause the qualifications usually are not...

111
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,460
Usually are not like on TV.

112
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,180
And then...

113
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:05,720
So right now at the moment, there's an actual criminal investigation on her.

114
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,440
And her coach for like allowing them in.

115
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,560
Cause like somebody was like, this is her...

116
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,500
Somebody like showed a video of who it could have been to represent...

117
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,560
To represent Australia.

118
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,720
Cause like her rival...

119
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,680
They showed like a video of her rival.

120
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,340
Like that was supposed to...

121
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:26,980
That was like...

122
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,300
That was facing her to qualify into the...

123
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,260
To qualify as Australia's like break dancer.

124
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,620
And like she's so much better.

125
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,660
She's actually so much better.

126
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,480
I was like, how the fuck...

127
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,620
How the fuck did this girl got in?

128
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:47,800
So...

129
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,480
So like there's an actual criminal investigation going on now.

130
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,340
About...

131
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,220
About her.

132
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,480
Cause she's not even...

133
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,560
People are like, there's no way.

134
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,800
There's no way.

135
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,420
Anyway, I thought that was crazy.

136
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,400
I thought that was actually absolutely insane.

137
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,300
That...

138
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:11,860
The IOC is planning on doing an investigation on Australia.

139
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,260
And like on her.

140
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,880
Because like apparently...

141
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,580
It could have been rigged.

142
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,860
And she was actually not supposed to be representing Australia.

143
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,220
Um...

144
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,080
So...

145
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,820
Yeah...

146
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,340
Uh...

147
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,580
Uh...

148
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:28,980
And...

149
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,800
Uh...

150
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,620
Yeah...

151
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,040
And I...

152
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,960
Also like...

153
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,780
I was so surprised.

154
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,440
She's like a professor in break dancing.

155
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,920
How is that a thing?

156
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,240
I can't believe in Australia.

157
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,660
You can be a...

158
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,620
You can write a thesis on break dancing.

159
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,080
I was like...

160
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,380
What?

161
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:49,140
I was like...

162
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,500
You can be a prof...

163
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,400
You can get a PhD in break dancing.

164
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,860
It just keeps getting deeper.

165
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,100
The hole just keeps getting deeper and deeper.

166
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,520
You know what I'm thinking with the super chat.

167
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,300
Thank you.

168
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,060
We're sorry.

169
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:05,860
I was like...

170
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,000
Oh my god.

171
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,900
But in break dancing?

172
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,700
I was like...

173
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,160
Really?

174
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,920
Oh my god.

175
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,040
What is a thesis even gonna be about?

176
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,000
Do you just break dance for your thesis?

177
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,980
There's like so many things.

178
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,820
I'm so confused.

179
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,780
I'm actually so confused.

180
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,380
I'm so confused.

181
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,360
That like...

182
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,760
I learned way too much about...

183
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,760
I learned way too much about the situation.

184
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:35,120
It's like a little rabbit hole into like Australia.

185
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,480
The break dancing community in Australia.

186
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,060
But yeah.

187
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:43,800
Anyway.

188
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,620
I didn't even realize she scored zero throughout everything.

189
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,140
I was so surprised.

190
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,080
I was like...

191
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,300
Clearly, you know.

192
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,340
Maybe one point for like effort.

193
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,320
But no.

194
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,560
She got...

195
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,100
She got zero on everything.

196
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,440
I was like...

197
00:12:59,440 --> 00:12:59,660
Whoa!

198
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,400
You know, I thought it was funny.

199
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,500
But like...

200
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,940
Now it's very funny.

201
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,120
Now you got me invested.

202
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,280
Gee.

203
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,440
Thank you for the super chat.

204
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:16,820
Thank you.

205
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,460
Thank you.

206
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,280
Fifteen years from now, Doki will be a professor of VTubing at Harvard.

207
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:32,980
I heard you can... there's, like, esports... like, I know you can get, like, scholarship for esports, but now there's, like, um, university courses.

208
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:42,280
Um, there was... I remember there was, like, a university... I don't remember which university it was, but I read that you can take classes regarding esports.

209
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:50,300
Um, regarding esports, and there was, like, actual, like, classes dedicated to specific games.

210
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,660
I read this a long time ago.

211
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,900
Let me see if I can... esport university class.

212
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,140
I was, like... I was, like, what?

213
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:06,760
It was... it was, like... oh, yes, it was, like, a specialization regarding the education of esports.

214
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:13,280
So, like, you can literally, like, learn about, like, esports as, like, a university course.

215
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:19,500
And I thought that was super interesting, because I was, like, what kind of degree are you gonna get in that?

216
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,060
Like...

217
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,060
Esports, right?

218
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:31,800
Okay, this is, like, a little hot take, but, like, esports is such a new, um, a new job market that what's...

219
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:43,500
I personally think esports is not as profitable as people think it is, but, like, a lot of really old business people are, like, esports is the next big thing.

220
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:49,900
And they dump, like, millions and millions, hundreds of millions of dollars into it, and they don't see...

221
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,500
They don't see any return... business return.

222
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,100
They don't see any investment return in it.

223
00:14:54,200 --> 00:15:03,860
But, like, everybody's getting... like, the participants are getting paid very well, because, like, the old business people don't know what the fuck is going on.

224
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,820
They don't know what the fuck is going on.

225
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,660
So, like, the participants and the players and, like, the coaches and everybody, like, within that's making it happen are getting paid.

226
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,460
Like...

227
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,140
So,

228
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:37,880
if they press the button, they make a deal with the person that had like worked for them, it's going to have a valid return.

229
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,660
Because, like, it's not what their eisports represents.

230
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,880
What I'm saying is that...

231
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,580
It doesn't represent their potential, but, like, it's something that is obvious like...

232
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,020
That's where I'm at.

233
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:48,520
If what I'm saying is...

234
00:15:48,520 --> 00:16:07,540
Like, that's not really where the money... I don't think that's really where the money is in general, and like, it's just, I just think it's like super interesting to see like how much money is being thrown into it, and like, it's just like oil money is being thrown into it right now,

235
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:18,380
if you guys didn't know, like Saudi Arabia has like, their new like law policy at the moment is like investing heavily into the esports scene, so it's like very interesting.

236
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,660
Um, it's very interesting, you're literally being thrown oil money.

237
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,860
Um, anyway, anyway, it is God of War time!

238
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:35,720
It is God of War, part two!

239
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:41,600
I don't know how long I'm gonna be playing today, because I'm a little bit eepy, but maybe the coffee's gonna kick in by then.

240
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:52,460
Uh, buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh, alright, so, apparently, a lot of people are like telling me that, like, I'm gonna get punished really hard if I keep doing God of Gun.

241
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:59,740
So, so, today's the day, I'm actually gonna learn new combos.

242
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,640
I also forgot the controls already.

243
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,800
Uh, I, I already forgot the controls, so this is gonna be interesting.

244
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:11,220
Um, like always, I always forget how to play this video game.

245
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,460
Alright, shield.

246
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,860
Alright, this is gun.

247
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,460
Okay, how do I bring gun back?

248
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,060
Gun, come back.

249
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,220
Come back, gun.

250
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:21,860
Gun.

251
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:23,500
Gun?

252
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,800
Oh, okay, I figured it out.

253
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,140
Okay.

254
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,860
Alright, I figured... Alright.

255
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,860
Almost got it.

256
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,440
I almost remembered everything.

257
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:32,500
Alright.

258
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:34,920
Alright.

259
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,360
Okay, and then...

260
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,620
Okay, that's making the boy shoot.

261
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,940
Okay, and then...

262
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:46,180
How do I... Okay, that's sheathing my, my gun.

263
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,880
And then...

264
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,540
Uh, it's a gun even harder.

265
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,240
Bros, thank you for the super chat.

266
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:53,880
Thank you, thank you.

267
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,480
Okay, how do I fight normally?

268
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,840
How do I... How do I fight normally?

269
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,420
Okay, I don't.

270
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,340
Wait, okay, give me a second.

271
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,200
I don't remember how to fight normally.

272
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,040
I don't remember how to...

273
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,840
Okay, um, normal fight.

274
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,280
Oh, hold R2.

275
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,640
An R1.

276
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:19,720
Alright.

277
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,160
Alright, there we go.

278
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:22,900
There we go.

279
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,000
We figured it out, guys!

280
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,200
Guys, we fucking learned!

281
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,980
What the fuck?!

282
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,240
Okay, and then I throw gun.

283
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:30,960
Sorry.

284
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,000
Alright, there we go!

285
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:34,800
We did it!

286
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,580
Yes, I know!

287
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:41,780
The first thing I did was throw gun, but you don't understand that we were at highground!

288
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,220
You don't understand!

289
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,540
It's just convenient!

290
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,000
What the fuck?!

291
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,980
Of course I'm gonna throw it!

292
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,360
They're literally- oh my god, no, not the fucking desert crocodiles.

293
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:58,820
Oh god.

294
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,500
Not you too.

295
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,440
Why is there- is the dwarf just letting me fucking kill people?

296
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,040
Oh no.

297
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,720
Oh god.

298
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,720
Here we go.

299
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,180
Please, please, son, help me!

300
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,580
Don't be worthless!

301
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:14,820
Don't be worthless!

302
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,220
Please, son!

303
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,060
Please!

304
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,260
Okay, we're fine.

305
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,480
All right, we're fine.

306
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,280
Where the fuck did they come from?

307
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,880
Is this even part of the story?

308
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,000
Okay, I need a- where am I supposed to go?

309
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,400
Where- I'm so confused.

310
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:34,920
All right.

311
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,060
Wait, I hear a crow.

312
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:37,900
Where's the crow?

313
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,720
I hear him.

314
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,460
I hear you.

315
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,500
I hear you, you government spy.

316
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,320
Don't worry.

317
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,020
I know how to block.

318
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,420
I just don't do it.

319
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,040
Oh shit, okay.

320
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,360
All right, what's this?

321
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,900
What is this?

322
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,400
Do I just... keep hitting?

323
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:01,900
What is that?

324
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,600
What is that?

325
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,440
Where's the third one?

326
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,020
One... oh hey, loot!

327
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,380
Okay.

328
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,440
Is that loot or just... what the fuck- you're cold?

329
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,840
The sun is out.

330
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,480
Why are you cold?

331
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,140
A man shouldn't be cold.

332
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,200
We don't get cold.

333
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,520
I'm not even wearing a shirt, boy.

334
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,820
You think I'm fucking cold?

335
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:45,960
Okay, okay and then Is that?

336
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,680
What am I doing?

337
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,680
All right.

338
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:56,760
Yes, not only am I father of the year, I'm also mother of the year too.

339
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:58,800
What?

340
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,600
Oh, I get it.

341
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,440
I'll get it.

342
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,640
And then we do this.

343
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,260
And then we do this.

344
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,920
And then we don't do that?

345
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,780
Oh, maybe like this?

346
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,020
Wait, what?

347
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:14,120
What?

348
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,260
Is this a puzzle?

349
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,080
Is there anything in here?

350
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,640
Please, I'm still waking up.

351
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,880
Please don't do this to me.

352
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,400
God, please.

353
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,640
I don't understand.

354
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,000
Okay, W.

355
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,360
What the fuck?

356
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,280
Oh, that's W!

357
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,460
W.

358
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,120
W.

359
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:42,920
W.

360
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,220
Now what?

361
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,400
Now what?

362
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,720
P.

363
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,220
W?

364
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:32,700
W.

365
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,680
Oh, I've missed.

366
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,400
You can hear the cogwheel slowly turning.

367
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:45,400
Oh, shit!

368
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,580
There's a second one!

369
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,400
Guys, why didn't you tell me there's a second one?

370
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:58,740
You can actually hear the cogwheel turning in my fucking brain.

371
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,720
Dad's like...

372
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,880
Oh, shit.

373
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,400
Okay.

374
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,700
All right, we can figure this out.

375
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,160
There are more than one.

376
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,700
And then there's this one.

377
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,800
Okay, we gotta do this.

378
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,420
So I can see...

379
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,860
Wait, wait, that's it!

380
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,960
What do I need?

381
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,680
I need...

382
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,960
Okay, backwards B.

383
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,100
All right.

384
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,880
Shady, thank you for the super chat.

385
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,680
Thank you, thank you.

386
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,920
Here we see a wild doki bird.

387
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,100
Let's see how long it takes for her to figure out a puzzle.

388
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,340
All right.

389
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,400
Is that it?

390
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,760
That's a backwards B, guys.

391
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,580
All right, we did it, guys.

392
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,080
Oh, my God.

393
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,360
I actually think I'm like...

394
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,580
I think I'm becoming a bimbo.

395
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:02,660
I don't think anybody can fix me right now.

396
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:07,040
I don't think anybody can fix this.

397
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,600
Oh, God.

398
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,640
I went to university.

399
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,140
What is this?

400
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,560
Oh, up we go, boy.

401
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,360
Are we getting closer to the mountain?

402
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,100
Are we?

403
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,040
Is this...

404
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:21,540
Are we?

405
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,500
I can't tell.

406
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,960
Where's my axe?

407
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:25,700
All right.

408
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,260
There it is.

409
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,660
Oh, shit.

410
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,760
What the fuck are you...

411
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,800
That's right.

412
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,960
Die in the poison.

413
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,120
Is he still alive?

414
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,900
Oh, he's dead.

415
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,020
Did I actually do it?

416
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,880
Oh, that's funny.

417
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:39,040
Wait.

418
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:39,980
Did he actually die?

419
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,600
Wait.

420
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,680
He did.

421
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,180
Loser.

422
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,420
All right.

423
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,440
Just loot.

424
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,340
Loot time.

425
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:52,840
Yay.

426
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,120
All right.

427
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,660
What's in it?

428
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,220
Time to desecrate the gods.

429
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,280
Ooh.

430
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,060
Found armor.

431
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:07,000
Runic symbols on the simple armor increases the quality of the weapon.

432
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:07,220
Cool down.

433
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:07,760
Nice.

434
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,000
It's all right.

435
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,560
It's okay to grave rob because they're not my god.

436
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:19,120
I don't worship these guys.

437
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:25,520
That means I can grave rob them because if I don't worship them, they don't exist in my world.

438
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,080
That's how it goes.

439
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:27,340
Right?

440
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:29,940
Yeah.

441
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,620
They're not my god.

442
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,700
So like how...

443
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,060
I can't get punished if I don't believe in them.

444
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,280
How can they curse me if like I don't see them as real?

445
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,380
Bye.

446
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:43,800
Wait.

447
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,200
What?

448
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,020
Wait.

449
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,220
You lit through the poison?

450
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,040
What the fuck?

451
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,220
That's not how it's supposed to work.

452
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,620
You're supposed to die from your own poison.

453
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,200
It's okay.

454
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,120
I'm gonna beat you up with my arms.

455
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,780
You think I don't have...

456
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,660
I have fucking arms.

457
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:00,820
That's right.

458
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,760
That's right.

459
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,140
Get over here.

460
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:04,680
Get over here.

461
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,040
Get over here.

462
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,860
I'll beat you up with my fucking fists.

463
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,580
You think I don't...

464
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,220
Oh shit.

465
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,620
That's fucking right.

466
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,460
That's fucking right.

467
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,020
Get these hands.

468
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,900
Get over here.

469
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,540
Get over here.

470
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,840
That's fucking right.

471
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,220
I don't care.

472
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:27,260
I'm not even gonna fucking grab my axe.

473
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,480
Think I care?

474
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,700
World star.

475
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,020
No.

476
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:34,620
No.

477
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,040
No.

478
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,600
World star.

479
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,400
World star.

480
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,300
Get over here.

481
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,220
That's right.

482
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:40,900
Oh shit.

483
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:41,620
Oh no.

484
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,480
Oh no.

485
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,460
Maybe I'm gonna get punished.

486
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,060
That's fucking right.

487
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,120
Get over here.

488
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,260
Where did he go?

489
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,520
Where did he go?

490
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,260
I can't see.

491
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,160
World star.

492
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,800
Holy shit.

493
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,000
He's beating me up in the corner.

494
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,580
That's fucking right.

495
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,340
Where are you?

496
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,480
I see you.

497
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,020
I see you.

498
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,300
No, I'm not wasting my rage.

499
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,640
It's a fucking witch.

500
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,020
I'm not gonna waste my rage on it.

501
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,920
What did I update?

502
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,220
Oh, she's not.

503
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,700
Oh, she doesn't care about poison.

504
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,540
Alright.

505
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:31,780
Nice.

506
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,540
I won my... this is my Olympic gold match.

507
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,120
Alright, I'm a little lost now.

508
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,940
What the fuck was I supposed to...

509
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,760
What's this?

510
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,660
Okay, I don't have access to this yet.

511
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:44,600
Alright.

512
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,120
I guess like... what is in here then?

513
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:52,740
Alright.

514
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,480
What's this?

515
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,420
Open.

516
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,580
I'm doing magic?

517
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,340
I'm a god.

518
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,640
Don't I know magic?

519
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,180
As a god, don't I automatically have magic powers?

520
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,400
For later.

521
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:07,940
Okay.

522
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,280
Let's see.

523
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,580
Maybe we go this... we have to go this way then.

524
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,020
Alright.

525
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:17,540
Axe.

526
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,180
Come back.

527
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,760
I really need heals.

528
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:21,640
What?

529
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:21,940
No!

530
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:22,960
Fuck.

531
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,580
That's not what I wanted to do.

532
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,220
No, I wasted my magic.

533
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,740
No, that was magic!

534
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,640
God damn it.

535
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,320
I should've killed more of my family members.

536
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,040
So I can absorb more blood into my skin.

537
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,320
And gain the magic abilities.

538
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,500
Magic does not equal god powers?

539
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,620
Wait, is that a dog?

540
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,480
Is that a good dog?

541
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,420
Can't tell.

542
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,620
Alright, we'll figure it out.

543
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,280
I don't think they're good dogs.

544
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:00,640
To be fair, I think it's because I threw an axe on them.

545
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,940
Okay, don't worry.

546
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,060
I'll use real fighting powers now.

547
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,220
Don't worry.

548
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:07,880
Now.

549
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,520
Sorry, I missed.

550
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,820
I'm sorry!

551
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,660
I don't know how arms work!

552
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,460
It's been so long since I used hands!

553
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,940
I didn't know how far my hands were!

554
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,800
I don't know why I have fucking short-ass hands!

555
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,400
Alright, let's see.

556
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,260
Okay, there should be stuff in here.

557
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,260
Alright, we need HP.

558
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,760
You have a family member right there, Justin.

559
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:37,780
Yep, I need him.

560
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,280
It's like Hansel and Gretel where the witch wants to grow the boy.

561
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,860
I need the boy to get more plump and juicy before I absorb him.

562
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,580
And then I'll be stronger.

563
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,800
Burrito, thank you for the super chat!

564
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,100
Thank you!

565
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:52,620
Thank you!

566
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:57,220
I gotta, like, fatten up the boy before he gets absorbed.

567
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,900
Wait, how is there two?

568
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,780
How do I get to two?

569
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,680
I can't count to two.

570
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,700
The circle of life.

571
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,080
Exactly!

572
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,880
Is this why I have the boy around?

573
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,040
That's why the boy is around.

574
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,640
That's why I keep him alive, right?

575
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,260
Doki, don't say that!

576
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:16,680
What?

577
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,520
He's got me!

578
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,440
He's killing your kids!

579
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:29,580
It's like in, like, almost every fucking mytholo- God, like, mythology and shit.

580
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,000
Fire doesn't fucking hurt me.

581
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:32,760
I'm a god.

582
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,660
Oh, shit.

583
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,420
Okay, wait.

584
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,540
There's, like, a pot right there.

585
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,200
There we go.

586
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:40,940
Yeah!

587
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:46,140
It's all- You think- You think gods care about their kids?

588
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:49,720
Nope!

589
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,840
None of the gods care about their children!

590
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:56,260
A quick dash attack with a follow-up strike.

591
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,360
Kratos is protected during the dash.

592
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,120
Oh, shit!

593
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,340
Wait, that's cool.

594
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,000
Oh, I do that.

595
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,560
Hold a charge of the white- Oh, not enough XP.

596
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,680
Some care too much?

597
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,680
Okay, we don't- Look, we're not here to talk about Zeus.

598
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:19,200
We're not- We're not- Alright.

599
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:21,740
Let's see.

600
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,080
Common chest armor.

601
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:23,520
Ooh!

602
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,240
I like that.

603
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,980
As long as it's not a shirt, that's all that matters.

604
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,840
You gotta pay the troll's toll to get into that boy's soul.

605
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:32,540
Exactly!

606
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,400
They know what's up.

607
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:42,720
I think if Sunny in Philadelphia was ever made in today's- in today's time, that show would get cancelled so fucking quick.

608
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:52,320
Like- Now it's like- now, like, nobody, like, judges Sunny in Philadelphia cause it's like- it's like when a professor gets tenure.

609
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,520
So you're like, oh, guys.

610
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,640
Look, that show- this is the longest-running comedy series ever, guys.

611
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,180
Like, it's a really- I love Sunny in Philadelphia.

612
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,460
I fucking love Sunny in Philadelphia.

613
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,700
But, like, it's like basically a- It's like a show that just got tenured.

614
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:16,960
Who is this?

615
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:17,700
A giant gorilla?

616
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,580
Oh, he doesn't even have sub- subtitles.

617
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:25,220
Whoa!

618
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,060
Shit, boy!

619
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,920
Boy, you can't die!

620
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,060
You haven't absorbed you!

621
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,120
Wait, I'm a god.

622
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,280
I can regenerate an arm.

623
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,080
Let him eat my arm.

624
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,620
It is Shrek.

625
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:40,540
Oh!

626
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,380
Cut off your toes.

627
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:51,890
Wait, what?

628
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:53,870
What is he doing?

629
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:54,730
What are you doing here?

630
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:55,650
Where's the third party?

631
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,750
Wait, you're still fighting me?

632
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,590
Don't worry.

633
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:06,730
I learned that I have more than one move.

634
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:08,970
This!

635
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:11,830
And Raichu, this is it!

636
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:14,030
This is what I've been waiting for!

637
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:15,630
Right here!

638
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:16,710
Right now!

639
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:20,270
That's fucking- Oh, it's over?

640
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,570
Oh, oh, okay.

641
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:22,510
Oh.

642
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,490
Okay, I did not realize.

643
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:25,810
Okay!

644
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,470
Oh, shit!

645
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:28,070
Okay.

646
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:30,030
Hey, guys?

647
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:41,610
You did not- Guys, why is Raichu so- Why is Raichu- Raichu is so short!

648
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:44,990
I saved that Raichu for like 20 years!

649
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,050
And that's all I get?!

650
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:48,870
That's all I get!

651
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:54,810
That's actually all I get after I saved Raichu for like five hours.

652
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:57,730
Oh, wait, I can attack people.

653
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:58,790
Okay.

654
00:33:58,970 --> 00:33:59,670
That's right.

655
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:00,710
All right, stop hitting yourself!

656
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:01,810
Stop hitting yourself!

657
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,290
Stop hitting yourself!

658
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,310
That's fucking right!

659
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,210
Yeah, stop hitting yourself!

660
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,070
There we go.

661
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:08,350
Nice.

662
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:10,270
Easy.

663
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:13,070
That's right, now I'm gonna eat your fucking brain.

664
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:14,530
Because of my myth.

665
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:16,110
Apparently, it makes you smarter.

666
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:17,810
All right.

667
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:21,430
Oh, shit!

668
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:22,470
I forgot you explode!

669
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:24,490
All right.

670
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:26,610
Goodbye.

671
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:30,430
I'm done.

672
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,910
I'm done playing this game legit.

673
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,470
Oh, shit!

674
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:38,810
I forgot!

675
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,350
I forgot you can regen!

676
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:42,610
How do I dodge again?!

677
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:43,150
I don't remember!

678
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:45,230
Oh!

679
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:46,830
Act Gun!

680
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:48,110
Gun, go!

681
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:50,670
Gun, go!

682
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,870
I forgot how to dodge...

683
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,330
How do I dodge again?

684
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:57,390
Dodge?

685
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:58,690
Oh, X!

686
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:00,390
All right.

687
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,190
That's how you dodge!

688
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:05,810
Win and down Axe Throw!

689
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:07,050
Oh, nice.

690
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:08,190
I guess I got a new enchantment.

691
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:11,290
Do I have enough XP yet to get more skills?

692
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:14,450
An impossible material that houses the rage of fire.

693
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:18,390
Oh!

694
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:20,770
I can upgrade my gun!

695
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,150
Sweet.

696
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,670
Alright, that was easy.

697
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,970
That was pretty fucking easy.

698
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:29,830
Alright, into the house we go!

699
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:31,390
Woo!

700
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:34,750
What was he guarding?

701
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:38,130
Mountains... base.

702
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:39,010
Okay.

703
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:41,750
I can see why mom wanted us to bring her here.

704
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:47,570
All I'm saying though, out of all the gods in every mythology and legend...

705
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,410
I would say...

706
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:54,270
I would say I am currently the best... the nicest one.

707
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:55,330
The nicest dad.

708
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,650
Out of all of them.

709
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:04,470
Like, the worst I would say...

710
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:06,810
The worst I did was that...

711
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:09,570
I yelled at my kid for not being able to kill.

712
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:12,610
Every god's child can kill.

713
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:16,090
But yet my kid decided to be a fucking baby.

714
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:19,370
What are the other gods gonna say about this?

715
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:20,170
Huh?

716
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,570
They're gonna be like...

717
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:26,890
Wow Kratos, your child can't even fucking kill a mere mortal?

718
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:29,350
Like, what are you teaching him now?

719
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:32,650
Your child wants to be an artist?

720
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:33,790
Like...

721
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:36,570
How am I gonna show my face to all the other gods?

722
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:40,130
It's so embarrassing.

723
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:44,090
It's not like he's killing a fucking beast or anything.

724
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:45,390
It was a human.

725
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,470
A human is like mice.

726
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:50,650
It's like an ant to a god.

727
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:56,090
Anyway, let's see.

728
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:58,610
Alright.

729
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:00,770
Next thing I know...

730
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:02,150
He's gonna be like...

731
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:04,290
Dad, I don't wanna take off my shirt.

732
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:06,550
I don't want people to see my shirt.

733
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:07,050
I don't want people to see my nipples.

734
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:08,230
Boy!

735
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:10,330
What do you mean about this?

736
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:16,970
What the fuck is this shadow thing?

737
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:21,690
Wait, she followed me?

738
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,130
Fucking stalker?

739
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,210
And...

740
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:39,150
He's gone.

741
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:45,390
moMI Where is this?

742
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:48,330
Where?

743
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:52,110
I don't know.

744
00:37:52,270 --> 00:38:03,470
He is peut- You got killed.shot

745
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:10,030
What the fuck did you do?

746
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:20,570
Oh my god!

747
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:23,050
It doesn't even matter!

748
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:25,910
We could have killed that pig and she'll still like me.

749
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:30,430
That's fucked.

750
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:34,370
That pig like knew her for like maybe like 50 plus years.

751
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:38,370
I met her... I almost killed that friend and then she's like, that's alright.

752
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,290
I think I like you.

753
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:44,990
That poor fucking pig.

754
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:49,230
I literally just met that girl.

755
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:53,210
Oops, did not mean to do that.

756
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:56,190
These are vines.

757
00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:00,410
What's the use of having an axe if I can't even kill fucking girls?

758
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:00,830
That's grass.

759
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:05,330
We're so in.

760
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:08,150
We shouldn't have even cured the pig.

761
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:09,390
We should have ate it to celebrate.

762
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:13,150
Let's see.

763
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:15,130
Fatt, welcome to the tomato farm!

764
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:15,870
Welcome, welcome!

765
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:17,910
Oh, she's gonna teach me magic?

766
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,760
It doesn't matter what element an axe is.

767
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,480
An axe is an axe!

768
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:28,440
Can't.

769
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,820
Sindri said it was broken.

770
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:30,860
Sindri?

771
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,900
The dwarf at the foot of these hills.

772
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,980
He was fixing it when we got here.

773
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,480
No one was there when I passed by.

774
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,680
Perhaps he finished.

775
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,240
Dwarves are awesome.

776
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:40,820
Let me through.

777
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,840
And irritating, based on the two we have met.

778
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:45,920
That too.

779
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,560
That's right, fuck these jars in particular.

780
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:53,380
Give what a turn?

781
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:54,340
Oh.

782
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,320
Okay.

783
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,640
Yeah, couldn't she help us with the other vine?

784
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,460
Oh, it's the fast pass!

785
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,220
I see there's a shortcut.

786
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:08,880
Tyr's temple?

787
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:13,120
Alfheim?

788
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,560
Now she's just saying words.

789
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,960
No one knows.

790
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,960
He just appeared one day.

791
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,760
Soon after, Thor attacked.

792
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,400
And their battle could be felt across all the realms.

793
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,440
Ultimately, it ended in a stalemate.

794
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,880
And Thor returned to Odin empty-handed.

795
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,680
The serpent stayed and grew so large, he now spans all of Midgard.

796
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,080
Oh, is that the dog?

797
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,600
They've hated each other ever since.

798
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,420
Destined to kill each other come Ragnarok.

799
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,460
You believe in Ragnarok?

800
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,780
The fuck do you mean, do you believe in Ragnarok?

801
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:51,900
The fuck?

802
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,380
Your dad's a god!

803
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,100
Is this where you stop believing?

804
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,300
Anything can happen here but Ragnarok?

805
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,120
No, that's where we draw the line.

806
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:10,240
The giant snake that fucking encompasses the entire world.

807
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,500
But no, Ragnarok is like...

808
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,360
That's a myth.

809
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,820
Alright, let's see.

810
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,040
Wait, where did the dwarf go?

811
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,740
Maybe we can rob him?

812
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,120
Where the fuck did the dwarf go?

813
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,140
Alright.

814
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,820
I wanted to rob him.

815
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:32,720
Oh, it's time?

816
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:33,540
Touch.

817
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:34,600
Feel.

818
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:34,860
Oh.

819
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:35,900
Nevermind.

820
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,280
Open.

821
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:43,250
There's too...

822
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,450
That's way too much make-believe.

823
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:54,210
Wait, we don't even know her name.

824
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:56,530
She's just Witch of the Woods.

825
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:00,610
Yeah, watch her.

826
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:02,150
Oh!

827
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:07,730
My bowstring was soaked in the light of Ulfheim.

828
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:09,230
It can now re- WAIT!

829
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:09,850
Are you an elf?

830
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:11,570
Wait.

831
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:13,670
It won't just disappear, will it?

832
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:14,630
How the fuck?

833
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:15,690
Not as long as the light shines forth.

834
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:16,950
How the fuck do you know elven magic?

835
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:19,530
I want one.

836
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:21,950
Those roots?

837
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:23,950
What kind of magic is that?

838
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,010
It's Vanir.

839
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:26,090
From Vanahan?

840
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:27,090
You know of it?

841
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:27,990
Just stories.

842
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:30,350
Mother didn't say much about the Vanir gods.

843
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:32,910
Just that they're always at war with the Aesir.

844
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:34,630
As compared to Ulaan Dor.

845
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:43,730
Where do I go?

846
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:44,230
Oh!

847
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:47,270
Use your fucking magic to open the door!

848
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:48,330
Am I just like...

849
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:51,830
I'm just a butler for... I'm just a piece of meat for them.

850
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,160
Alright, off we go.

851
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,000
I mean, you are!

852
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,640
Oh, we're back here.

853
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,600
Hello, dog!

854
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,120
Wait!

855
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,300
I just remembered!

856
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:26,420
Guys!

857
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:28,220
Wait, I just remembered!

858
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,580
We could have played this game with better graphics now!

859
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:33,140
Okay, give me a sec.

860
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,160
Give me a sec.

861
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:35,400
I want better graphics.

862
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:35,980
Give me a sec.

863
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:43,200
Okay, we can actually... Oh my god!

864
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,600
I'm gonna do it!

865
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:48,900
I'm gonna do 120 FPS!

866
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,840
Okay, what is it?

867
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:53,160
Is it... Oh, yes!

868
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:54,840
Yes!

869
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,180
Yes!

870
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:01,880
Okay, let me bring up my task manager just in case.

871
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:02,520
Oh!

872
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:04,820
Guys!

873
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:07,460
Guys, is that 99%?

874
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:08,920
99% CPU.

875
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:09,980
Okay, maybe...

876
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,740
Okay, maybe I was a little too confident.

877
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,660
Maybe I was... I was a little too confident.

878
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:22,540
Okay.

879
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:26,380
That was actually...

880
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,200
Okay.

881
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:29,520
Okay.

882
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,680
Okay, we won't do ultra performance.

883
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:35,340
Okay.

884
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:36,320
Wait.

885
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:36,760
Okay.

886
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,580
Okay, here we go.

887
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,100
Oh, no!

888
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:38,560
Not this!

889
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:39,420
I want...

890
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:40,080
All right.

891
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:40,940
Guys.

892
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,520
I think... I think...

893
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,100
That's fine.

894
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,080
That's fine.

895
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,280
I can do it with 120 FPS.

896
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:52,440
So, we're okay now.

897
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,700
It was the CPU that was like...

898
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:58,000
You're getting a little bit too cocky there.

899
00:44:59,480 --> 00:44:59,960
Okay.

900
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:02,820
All right.

901
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:03,920
That should be fine.

902
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,520
That should be fine, right?

903
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:06,700
All right.

904
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:06,920
All right.

905
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:11,220
All right.

906
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:11,400
Nice.

907
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:11,880
Okay.

908
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,160
Nice.

909
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,640
120 now.

910
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:18,860
Okay.

911
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:20,120
Maybe I was a little too cocky.

912
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:20,520
Maybe...

913
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,900
Maybe I was a little too cocky here.

914
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:23,760
Maybe I'll do...

915
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,980
I'll do 100 and...

916
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:25,800
My...

917
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:26,000
My...

918
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:26,680
I see my...

919
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,500
My CPU being like, please.

920
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,360
Okay.

921
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:31,720
Okay.

922
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:34,920
Okay.

923
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:35,500
Okay.

924
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,240
All right.

925
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:36,580
All right.

926
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:37,580
Okay.

927
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,300
Here we go.

928
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,200
Oh.

929
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,500
If I do this, does it make it prettier?

930
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:43,820
This...

931
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:46,580
I still don't really know what DLSS actually...

932
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:47,460
Actually does.

933
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,200
I just listen to what you guys tell me to do.

934
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:52,720
Okay.

935
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:55,880
It helps perform.

936
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:56,880
It makes it uglier.

937
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:57,680
Oh!

938
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:58,340
Okay.

939
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:58,980
We don't want that.

940
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,380
We want it to look beautiful.

941
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,220
It's that original graphics.

942
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,300
Do I make Ultra?

943
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:04,980
Guys!

944
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:05,480
I want Ultra!

945
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:06,020
I'm gonna do it!

946
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:07,900
Guys!

947
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:10,240
I'm gonna do it.

948
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,540
We don't care about...

949
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:14,940
Okay.

950
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,180
I don't care about reflection.

951
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:19,620
All right.

952
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:25,010
It looks the same.

953
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:30,410
It looks the same.

954
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:34,270
I don't see any difference to be fair.

955
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:36,090
All right.

956
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:38,290
Okay.

957
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:39,670
Make a right at the bottom of these stairs.

958
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:41,570
Okay.

959
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:43,770
Go down here.

960
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:47,950
I don't know what's different.

961
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:49,370
Where the fuck?

962
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:49,790
It looks...

963
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:50,630
Literally looks the same.

964
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:52,450
Hey!

965
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:54,090
Another one of those light crystals.

966
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:57,250
Wait there while I reawaken the light.

967
00:46:58,290 --> 00:46:58,750
Leosta.

968
00:46:58,890 --> 00:46:59,810
Look at the faces.

969
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:00,110
Boy!

970
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:01,950
I need to look at your face boy.

971
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:03,550
Come over here.

972
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:05,010
Are you HD?

973
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:05,710
Yeah.

974
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:05,930
I'm gonna go with this.

975
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:08,570
Bro, it looks the same!

976
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:09,450
I can't tell!

977
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:11,530
I actually can't tell!

978
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:12,630
He looks the same!

979
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:15,990
I guess I can see like the fur on his fucking shirt.

980
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:25,690
Oh, I gotta lift.

981
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:26,270
Don't worry.

982
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:27,610
Don't worry.

983
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:32,390
I am a piece of meat and I'm ready to do... I'm ready to show you my muscles.

984
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:34,870
Use photo mode?

985
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:40,840
Okay.

986
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:41,760
Press H.

987
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,500
Got it.

988
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:52,540
Where am I pushing?

989
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:53,980
Oh!

990
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,020
Whoa!

991
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:03,600
You want help out?

992
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:05,040
Are you just gonna sit there?

993
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:07,720
First position?

994
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,360
I'm not tired!

995
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,760
I'm not tired!

996
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,060
Look at my abs!

997
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:20,940
That's right!

998
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:23,160
I'm dehydrated!

999
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:24,620
But I'm not tired!

1000
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,980
The boy said boy.

1001
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:33,640
Hellwalkers?

1002
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:34,300
What are they?

1003
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,820
They are poor, restless souls.

1004
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,920
Denied their judgment and their peace.

1005
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:39,940
By what?

1006
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,000
Could Vanir magic raise the dead?

1007
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,680
It could, once.

1008
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,700
But this is no spell.

1009
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:50,080
This plague of dead is but a symptom of a world out of...

1010
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,300
Wait, what made it out of balance?

1011
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:52,440
It can't be me, right?

1012
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:54,700
Someone has meddled with powerful forces.

1013
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:56,660
That is all I know for sure.

1014
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:57,980
Is it because I invaded this land?

1015
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,080
Is that why?

1016
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,820
I'm not because I'm a Norse god.

1017
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:04,960
No, I'm not a Norse god.

1018
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:05,520
I'm a Greek god.

1019
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:06,380
I forgot!

1020
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:10,300
Sorry, there's too many gods in this world.

1021
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:12,460
I forgot which type of god I am.

1022
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:16,300
Is it because I'm a Greek god in the Norse world?

1023
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:17,500
I didn't hurt your back, did you?

1024
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:18,600
I did not.

1025
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:21,930
Through these doors.

1026
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:26,090
Wait, so did the giants or the elves build Tearstone?

1027
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:27,450
Who built this?

1028
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:28,950
All the races helped with its construction.

1029
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:31,390
It was the last great act of cooperation...

1030
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:32,130
They worked together?

1031
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:33,470
No way!

1032
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:35,270
Elves are super racist!

1033
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:37,130
We all know that!

1034
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:38,910
They've always been racist!

1035
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:43,770
Alright, let's see.

1036
00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:46,950
In we go.

1037
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:53,090
Not right!

1038
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:54,470
You guys don't know?

1039
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:59,170
No matter what genre, elves have always been racist.

1040
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:03,610
No matter what game.

1041
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:05,110
No matter what history.

1042
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:07,810
We just hate everything.

1043
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:09,570
That's not elves!

1044
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:15,290
Your bowstring stopped glowing.

1045
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:17,750
Its power is now depleted.

1046
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:21,910
Only a few knocks of magic remained in the bowstring and we used them.

1047
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:26,630
Oh it's the string.

1048
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:27,890
Your bow please.

1049
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:33,190
Wait, My boy ain't getting pussy elf magic?!

1050
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:37,310
How fucking dare you!

1051
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:42,010
This is...

1052
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:44,810
This is a crutch!

1053
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:45,910
How dare you!

1054
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:50,790
How dare you give him some pussy ass elf magic!

1055
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:52,990
Now he'll never be strong!

1056
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:57,450
The gods don't care for me much.

1057
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:03,390
Now he'll be weak forever!

1058
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:05,550
He'll never learn!

1059
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:12,410
This temple has been asleep underwater for almost 150 winters.

1060
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:15,590
It needs only the light of the Bifrost to reawaken.

1061
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:17,170
Oh, Bifrost.

1062
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:18,830
I know what Bifrosts are.

1063
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:22,870
Weak ass elf magic.

1064
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:28,480
It's not true strength.

1065
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:31,940
Magic's not real.

1066
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,720
Magic's just illusion, boy.

1067
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:41,180
You wanna be a fucking magician, boy?

1068
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,280
First an artist, now a magician?

1069
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,300
Why are you always a disappointment?

1070
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,240
That of the year, 2024.

1071
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:54,820
Alright, we gotta go to the...

1072
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:55,160
table.

1073
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:57,300
How does it work?

1074
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:58,940
You will need this.

1075
00:51:59,020 --> 00:51:59,960
A Bifrost.

1076
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,120
To create travel between realms.

1077
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:05,500
Magic is temporary.

1078
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:06,820
Muscle is forever.

1079
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,860
Place the Bifrost there.

1080
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:12,660
True strength comes from gains, Arceus.

1081
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:15,940
What now?

1082
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:17,440
Give it a moment.

1083
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:20,780
The temple needs time to wake up from its long slumber.

1084
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:24,560
It is from this room, and this room alone.

1085
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:27,580
That you will be able to cross between realms.

1086
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:28,220
Oh!

1087
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:33,020
What you see before you represents the temple in which we stand.

1088
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:34,280
So I get to go to another realm.

1089
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:37,900
As well as the realm towers that encircle the lake of nine outside.

1090
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:43,900
All the realms exist in the same physical space, reflections of each other.

1091
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:53,260
These doors, the towers outside, and the nine realms are all intertwined and coexisting on the branches of the world tree.

1092
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:56,820
Separated only by the Bifrost light of Alfheim.

1093
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:00,480
This place can focus and control that light.

1094
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:02,600
And is this the world tree?

1095
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:05,280
Only an artistic representation of it.

1096
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:09,140
No, the Yggdrasil is much, much more than this.

1097
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,120
Wait, where's the...

1098
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,380
The tree of life is bound to the fate of the world.

1099
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:14,180
Where's the Yggdrasil so I can burn it?

1100
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,080
Just as we are bound to it.

1101
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:18,260
If I burn the tree, then all the realms die.

1102
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:22,360
The dew from its leaves beat our valleys and rivers.

1103
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:23,240
Is that what we want?

1104
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:27,420
The tree's very existence supports all of creation along its bounds.

1105
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:31,620
Its life energy interwoven into the tapestry of life.

1106
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,160
Birth, growth, death, and rebirth.

1107
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:40,820
Every strand transcending time, transcending space.

1108
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,560
Everything comes back to the tree.

1109
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:44,820
What if I just burn it?

1110
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:47,420
So, that's how it works.

1111
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:50,780
But I'm guessing you were looking for a more practical answer.

1112
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:51,820
Yes.

1113
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:54,400
Oh!

1114
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:58,400
The bridge you pushed outside is currently positioned to lead to the realm of Vanaheim.

1115
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:01,900
Instead, turn the wheel to our actual destination.

1116
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:03,100
Alfheim.

1117
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:04,280
Alfheim.

1118
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:04,800
Okay.

1119
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,440
The world of the elves.

1120
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:08,380
We need to destroy the elves.

1121
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:10,000
Is this moving the big bridge outside?

1122
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:10,860
Yes.

1123
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:11,740
Oh, Jotunheim!

1124
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:14,280
That's the ice world.

1125
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,420
And the bridge aligns to the different realm towers on the lake outside.

1126
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,240
Wait, there's no tower on this one.

1127
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:21,900
And that's why realm travel to Jotunheim is impossible.

1128
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:23,260
Wait, why?

1129
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,520
Without a tower for the bridge to lock into, the sequence can't begin.

1130
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,480
It's time to kill all the elves.

1131
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,720
Every realm has a travel route that locks the bridge to Vanaheim.

1132
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,640
You're teaching my boy fucking magic.

1133
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:36,100
I'm giving you the run for Alfheim.

1134
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:38,360
Now you can lock in your destination.

1135
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:44,500
If I destroy the elves, my boy will finally go to the gym.

1136
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:46,840
We're ready.

1137
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,580
Remember to take the Bifrost.

1138
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:50,120
You don't want to lose that.

1139
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:51,260
Alright.

1140
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:53,320
Now the realm travel bridge will align.

1141
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:55,380
And the realm between realms...

1142
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:56,240
Oh, get out of here.

1143
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:00,000
Let's see.

1144
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,620
See that giant crystal?

1145
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:05,540
Yeah.

1146
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:10,060
Each realm has a corresponding one that focuses and amplifies the power of the Bifrost.

1147
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:12,240
Opening the bridge to that realm.

1148
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:16,160
That's why realm travel is only possible from this room.

1149
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:18,700
What about that one realm tower on the second lake?

1150
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:20,600
Why is nobody guarding this place?

1151
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,660
The tower disappeared from all realms over a hundred years ago.

1152
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:23,500
Oh, I killed all of them.

1153
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:26,020
When the giants vanished from Midgard.

1154
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:29,520
Where the tower went and how they moved it remain a mystery.

1155
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,140
Oh, is this a loading screen?

1156
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,140
This is really pretty for a loading screen.

1157
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:43,290
What the fuck do you mean, boy?

1158
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:44,430
We're not outside yet.

1159
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:46,610
We're inside the tower.

1160
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:51,850
Boy, this is what happens when you become a magician.

1161
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:55,150
You're like too much on magic.

1162
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:00,410
Hey,

1163
00:56:05,330 --> 00:56:05,550
what the fuck are you doing?

1164
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:05,730
Can you just let me go?

1165
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:06,210
I think I want to die.

1166
00:56:06,970 --> 00:56:07,490
Oh, that's me.

1167
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:07,550
You're an idiot, boy.

1168
00:56:08,350 --> 00:56:10,750
I think I want to die but I can't.

1169
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:10,890
I'm dead.

1170
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:11,830
I'm dead.

1171
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:11,870
You need to die, boy.

1172
00:56:11,870 --> 00:56:15,490
Oh, a joint?

1173
00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:17,770
Oh, a joint.

1174
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:20,370
You need to die, boy.

1175
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:22,470
You need to die, boy.

1176
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:25,230
I can't, I can't.

1177
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:26,730
I can't.

1178
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:29,590
Alright.

1179
00:56:29,870 --> 00:56:30,190
Ooh!

1180
00:56:30,770 --> 00:56:31,610
Okay, we're back here.

1181
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:32,590
Did we bring the dwarf with us?

1182
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:33,310
What happened to the dwarf?

1183
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:39,070
If he's not here manning the station, I could have stolen... I should be allowed to steal his shit if he's not here.

1184
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:40,710
How would he know?

1185
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:45,080
Whoa!

1186
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:45,480
Nature!

1187
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,200
More stuff to cut!

1188
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:52,220
I like how you guys are saying, like, the temple was underwater.

1189
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,200
Yeah, but like, we're gods!

1190
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,220
Gods don't need to breathe!

1191
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:58,940
Breathing is a concept!

1192
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,200
The light?

1193
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,280
Oh!

1194
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:17,900
What's happening?

1195
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,720
Wait, what?

1196
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:27,640
What the fuck?

1197
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:38,060
Wouldn't they, like, position the god of, like, the ocean slash water to guard this place?

1198
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:39,880
There's gods for everything!

1199
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:44,460
I don't think she's allowed to be here, I guess.

1200
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:50,060
I think she's on house arrest or something.

1201
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:53,640
Don't touch these.

1202
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:56,940
These were made by elves.

1203
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,160
Don't you touch them.

1204
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,220
What's that?

1205
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:04,040
Can I cut this?

1206
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:05,180
Nice.

1207
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:05,540
Okay.

1208
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:09,520
Her visa got denied.

1209
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:11,100
Good!

1210
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:13,260
Fuck Nature.

1211
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:19,240
Do not touch the elves, boy.

1212
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:21,760
Elves made this place.

1213
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:24,260
Oh, hey!

1214
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:25,720
Boy, read!

1215
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,120
Yes, sir!

1216
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:30,760
What does it say?

1217
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:31,580
Hmm.

1218
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:34,540
Something about an eternal war for the light.

1219
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,140
Eternal war for the light?

1220
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:37,520
If both sides need it.

1221
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:40,080
Okay.

1222
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:41,300
Why not just share it?

1223
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:42,140
Greed.

1224
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,940
You will find it a common cause for war.

1225
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:46,840
Oh shit, are these dead elves?

1226
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:47,820
Good!

1227
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,640
Is that an elf?

1228
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:54,800
Wait, elves can fly?

1229
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:56,520
They keep murdering the lighthouse.

1230
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:57,980
Oh shit!

1231
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:58,820
No, that's good!

1232
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:00,920
Yeah, fuck you!

1233
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,300
Oh wait, no, wait.

1234
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:05,140
Wait, who are these?

1235
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:06,080
Are these also elves?

1236
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:07,660
Wait, who the fuck are these?

1237
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:10,300
What are you?

1238
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:12,920
Oh shit!

1239
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:14,700
Are you elves?

1240
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:15,420
I can't tell!

1241
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:18,780
Are you also elves?

1242
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:22,240
Wait, why can they fly?

1243
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:27,120
Get out of here!

1244
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:28,760
Get out of here!

1245
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:30,640
That's fucking right!

1246
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:33,000
Doesn't matter, you're still an elf!

1247
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:36,800
Oh, they're also elves?

1248
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:38,240
Oh, they're all elves!

1249
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:39,260
I told you, boy!

1250
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:42,520
I told you, boy!

1251
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:44,800
This is why we gotta exterminate these elves!

1252
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,580
How dare you think you can fly?

1253
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,060
Oh shit, it's dark!

1254
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:55,240
Is that a gang war?

1255
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:56,520
Are we in dark elf territory?

1256
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,220
More will come.

1257
00:59:58,560 --> 00:59:59,700
Alright, let's see.

1258
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:01,200
Dark elf!

1259
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:07,220
Unlike the light elves of ElfHim, the dark elves prefer dark places.

1260
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,060
Maybe that's why they wanted to cover up the light.

1261
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:12,740
They can fly and seem pretty smart and well coordinated.

1262
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:15,360
More so than most of the enemies we've fought so far.

1263
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:17,100
Oh, so they're like little mosquitoes!

1264
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:20,840
What do the light elves look like?

1265
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:24,680
So light elves have to be stuck on the ground and dark elves can fly?

1266
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:26,000
That's fucked!

1267
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:30,240
That's actually fucked, holy shit!

1268
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:32,220
Yeah, that's how...

1269
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:34,960
Yeah, you don't get to fucking fly!

1270
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,540
They're like little mosquitoes!

1271
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:41,720
Told you, boy!

1272
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,920
I told you, boy, to get rid of those goddamn elf magic!

1273
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:48,020
Sis!

1274
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:50,280
Break it!

1275
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:51,140
Oh, okay.

1276
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:55,920
What did I get?

1277
01:00:56,540 --> 01:00:57,380
Another cipher piece!

1278
01:00:57,580 --> 01:00:57,940
Ooh!

1279
01:00:58,740 --> 01:00:59,320
Let's see if I can fit together!

1280
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,060
We're gonna learn the magic!

1281
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:03,220
Do light elves...

1282
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:04,460
Are light elves the hippies?

1283
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,320
Are they like hippies?

1284
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:08,440
Like, what the fucking...

1285
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:09,700
Ooh, oh my god, they are!

1286
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:10,340
They don't wear shoes!

1287
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:11,440
Ugh!

1288
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:12,740
Do I wear shoes?

1289
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:14,400
I do, cause I'm...

1290
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:19,360
I do, cause I'm not a fucking elf!

1291
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,780
I do, cause I'm not a fucking elf!

1292
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,280
Ooh, compass aren't...

1293
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:31,120
When a compass turns gold, an objective is somewhere in the area.

1294
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:33,040
Search the area for clues!

1295
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:33,580
Okay!

1296
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:36,700
I'm gonna get rid of these...

1297
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:39,840
Because the god of war doesn't like nature.

1298
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:40,580
Wait, what?

1299
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:43,020
They regenerate?

1300
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:45,900
What the fuck?

1301
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,380
Why the fuck is that regenerating?

1302
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:53,780
Cause they taught my boy magic!

1303
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,220
Oh, it's like bowling!

1304
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,260
It's like bowling!

1305
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:04,100
I'm so fucking smart!

1306
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:09,580
Look what they did to my boy!

1307
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:12,340
All he does is magic now!

1308
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:26,240
And that is why I, as father of the year, shall hate all elves because of one thing that happened to him.

1309
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:28,100
Hello!

1310
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,420
Oh, it's the simp!

1311
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:35,940
Wait,

1312
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:41,420
why are you doing an elf again?

1313
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:44,180
Ah, hang on to that sense of wonder.

1314
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:48,240
There's so little mystery once you've amassed the wealth of arcane knowledge that I have.

1315
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:51,180
Where to comb the realms for exotic resources.

1316
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:54,160
How to craft them into creations that defy imagination.

1317
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:57,220
To the novice, I'm sure it all seems like magic.

1318
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,040
But...

1319
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:00,300
Oh, alright.

1320
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:01,780
It's magic.

1321
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:03,360
Are you happy now?

1322
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:05,040
Okay.

1323
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,140
Upgrade my stuff.

1324
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:10,100
Oh, I got an upgrade!

1325
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:11,300
Nice!

1326
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:13,020
Yay!

1327
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:16,180
Okay.

1328
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:18,160
What kind of upgrade do I have?

1329
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:19,960
Um...

1330
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:22,140
Oh, do I get chest armor upgrade?

1331
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,580
Wait, do I get better armor though?

1332
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:27,280
Compare.

1333
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:30,380
Uh, minus 14.

1334
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:31,820
Minus...

1335
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:33,500
No, you're not taking away my strength.

1336
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:34,740
How about this?

1337
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:36,720
Hmm...

1338
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,280
No, I like my strength.

1339
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:39,740
Hmm...

1340
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:40,580
I don't need defense.

1341
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:42,920
Oh, you're fine.

1342
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:44,260
You don't fucking need armor.

1343
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:45,560
You live forever.

1344
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:47,700
Unique...

1345
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:48,680
For...

1346
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:49,060
Oh!

1347
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:50,240
Can I add that?

1348
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:53,360
Do I have a handle already or nah?

1349
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:54,760
Let's see.

1350
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:56,860
Plus two, plus six.

1351
01:03:57,420 --> 01:03:58,300
Plus six.

1352
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:00,320
Uh...

1353
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:02,200
Alright, we'll get this.

1354
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:04,940
I mean, we do have hack silver for it.

1355
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:07,540
Oh, it's so expensive though.

1356
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:08,500
Maybe not.

1357
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:10,700
This is way too expensive.

1358
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:12,960
Okay, let's upgrade, I guess.

1359
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:14,760
Uh...

1360
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:15,820
What am I wearing?

1361
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:16,660
Okay, I'm wearing this.

1362
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:17,960
I don't have enough stuff.

1363
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:19,300
So...

1364
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:20,540
Woo...

1365
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:21,160
Okay, 750...

1366
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:23,800
Plus defense.

1367
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:25,160
Minus eight?

1368
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:26,720
I'm upgrading it.

1369
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:28,000
How?

1370
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:30,820
How is upgrading it taking away my strength?

1371
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:36,880
It's so dumb.

1372
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:38,440
Okay.

1373
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:41,520
Enchantments.

1374
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:43,740
I don't know what I'm doing, guys.

1375
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:45,020
I...

1376
01:04:45,020 --> 01:04:47,580
Guys, can you tell I don't know what I'm doing?

1377
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:48,640
No, right?

1378
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:51,240
Does it look like I'm a natural?

1379
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:51,420
I'm not.

1380
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:51,800
Do I look at this?

1381
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:53,740
Okay, let's see.

1382
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:59,940
I wanna make sure I have... do I have sockets?

1383
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:00,780
What am I wearing?

1384
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:01,080
Okay.

1385
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:04,180
Do I not have anything?

1386
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:05,660
Oh, I do!

1387
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:07,660
Symbol of Truth, plus 3.

1388
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:08,080
Okay.

1389
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:10,840
Alright, I have a socket on this.

1390
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:15,860
Nice, okay.

1391
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:22,640
Oh, I can have a... wait, when do I have equip this?

1392
01:05:22,820 --> 01:05:22,960
Okay.

1393
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:24,700
No, I don't have any more.

1394
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,780
I should have enough for skills, too.

1395
01:05:27,740 --> 01:05:28,740
I'm pretty sure.

1396
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:31,820
Am I level 3 yet?

1397
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:37,420
Okay, now... now let's actually upgrade our other close combat.

1398
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:42,580
Multiple times and that deals massive... Oh, I like massive damage!

1399
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:44,860
Oh!

1400
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:46,100
Wait, that's so cool!

1401
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:49,000
Okay, I can't do combos.

1402
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:50,580
I'm too fucking stupid for that.

1403
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:52,400
You know what?

1404
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:52,960
Let's do this.

1405
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:56,830
Yeah!

1406
01:05:57,790 --> 01:05:58,390
Yeah!

1407
01:05:58,830 --> 01:05:59,310
Yeah!

1408
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:02,110
Alright, let's see what else.

1409
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:03,630
Shield combat.

1410
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:06,290
To break an enemy's block.

1411
01:06:07,490 --> 01:06:09,150
To sweep off enemies.

1412
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:11,870
Wild Bear evade and press L.

1413
01:06:12,470 --> 01:06:18,110
Wild Bear hand and hold R2 to perform a shield slam and inflict moderate damage.

1414
01:06:18,710 --> 01:06:21,090
Why the fuck would I use... oh, wait.

1415
01:06:22,170 --> 01:06:24,050
Why would I use my fist, though?

1416
01:06:25,550 --> 01:06:27,830
Okay, I guess I'll give you something.

1417
01:06:30,310 --> 01:06:30,830
Acrobatic...

1418
01:06:33,330 --> 01:06:34,950
Increase the fire rate.

1419
01:06:35,150 --> 01:06:36,450
Increase... oh, arrow damage!

1420
01:06:38,270 --> 01:06:40,070
Alright, you get that upgrade.

1421
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:42,530
What is... what are these?

1422
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:46,250
Hold to select three targets on... oh, wait, what?

1423
01:06:46,490 --> 01:06:48,050
I get to select three targets?

1424
01:06:50,770 --> 01:06:51,610
Throw axe.

1425
01:06:51,970 --> 01:06:53,470
Yeah, but I have all the throw axe.

1426
01:06:54,350 --> 01:06:55,570
Oh, what do I get?

1427
01:06:57,070 --> 01:06:58,610
Oh, a massive explosion!

1428
01:06:58,830 --> 01:06:59,670
Wait, I like explosions!

1429
01:07:01,130 --> 01:07:02,610
Explosion means more damage!

1430
01:07:04,430 --> 01:07:05,310
Alright, nice.

1431
01:07:07,150 --> 01:07:09,170
Now Boy is just a little stronger.

1432
01:07:09,790 --> 01:07:11,350
Alright, Boy, get in here!

1433
01:07:17,110 --> 01:07:18,290
Get in here, Boy!

1434
01:07:18,670 --> 01:07:19,410
What'd you say?

1435
01:07:19,850 --> 01:07:20,810
I said nothing.

1436
01:07:22,130 --> 01:07:22,650
Really?

1437
01:07:23,350 --> 01:07:23,870
Okay.

1438
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:27,730
Oh my god, you fucking broke the fourth wall.

1439
01:07:31,410 --> 01:07:33,610
That's right, Boy, I said get in here!

1440
01:07:37,230 --> 01:07:39,430
Okay, well, I'll go this way.

1441
01:07:41,910 --> 01:07:44,010
Okay, but what if I go this way, though?

1442
01:07:45,230 --> 01:07:46,230
What is this way?

1443
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:47,450
Lead me.

1444
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:48,810
Oh, shit!

1445
01:07:49,110 --> 01:07:50,450
Oh, I can't.

1446
01:07:50,490 --> 01:07:52,190
There's like something above that I can shoot.

1447
01:07:52,930 --> 01:07:54,830
Boy is hearing the VTuber.

1448
01:07:55,730 --> 01:07:57,170
Alright, we go this way, then.

1449
01:08:04,430 --> 01:08:05,470
Oh, what?

1450
01:08:06,690 --> 01:08:07,970
Boy, I told you!

1451
01:08:08,570 --> 01:08:09,650
I told you!

1452
01:08:09,870 --> 01:08:11,810
Did you touch anything that else made?

1453
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:15,610
It's going all the way now.

1454
01:08:15,990 --> 01:08:17,390
I was screaming.

1455
01:08:18,270 --> 01:08:19,270
Lots of voices.

1456
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:19,830
Angry.

1457
01:08:22,350 --> 01:08:24,090
You really didn't hear that?

1458
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:25,270
No.

1459
01:08:25,610 --> 01:08:26,790
I told you, Boy!

1460
01:08:26,830 --> 01:08:29,230
It's the elf magic's fault, Boy!

1461
01:08:29,530 --> 01:08:30,490
I told you!

1462
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:39,680
We warned you, Boy!

1463
01:08:43,740 --> 01:08:44,260
Alright.

1464
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:46,240
Those damn fucky elves.

1465
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:50,800
Alright.

1466
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:52,180
Let's go.

1467
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:54,200
Oh, hey!

1468
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:54,880
There's more lighters!

1469
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:56,800
Hello, lighters!

1470
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:56,940
Hello, lighters!

1471
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:57,940
Or maybe they need help.

1472
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:01,500
I know I said a lot of shit about you guys, but okay.

1473
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:02,300
See, this is why!

1474
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:04,080
This is why I'm prejudiced now!

1475
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:08,700
You're only encouraging my prejudice against elves!

1476
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:10,800
This is all your fault!

1477
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:16,480
The one time I gave you a chance!

1478
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,520
You encour- This is why!

1479
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:24,460
The one time!

1480
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:24,740
Time!

1481
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:26,100
I gave them a chance!

1482
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:29,420
The twins were right!

1483
01:09:34,070 --> 01:09:35,190
Let's see...

1484
01:09:36,470 --> 01:09:37,590
I'll go this way.

1485
01:09:37,870 --> 01:09:38,250
Here

1486
01:09:42,110 --> 01:09:44,090
we go.

1487
01:09:44,310 --> 01:09:44,430
Ooh!

1488
01:09:46,010 --> 01:09:50,010
I wonder why there's like a gang war between the Dark Elves and the Light Elves.

1489
01:09:50,330 --> 01:09:51,190
Like, what happened?

1490
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:51,390
Whoa!

1491
01:09:53,050 --> 01:09:53,990
That's so pretty!

1492
01:09:58,320 --> 01:09:58,880
Alright.

1493
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:08,460
I see so many dead Light Elves, but like, no...

1494
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:10,680
no dead Dark Elves.

1495
01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:12,820
Oh my god, you guys are the hippies.

1496
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:16,700
Alright, boy.

1497
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:18,240
It's time.

1498
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:19,420
Read.

1499
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:32,720
What if I'm ruining?

1500
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:33,720
Okay.

1501
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:36,480
I have to find more stuff.

1502
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:38,320
Wait.

1503
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:39,660
You guys hear that?

1504
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,040
What is that?

1505
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:47,160
I heard like...

1506
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:51,140
I heard like some monster near me.

1507
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:54,740
I don't know if that's like ambient noise or something.

1508
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:56,840
There's like...

1509
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:58,020
There's like ahhh!

1510
01:10:58,420 --> 01:10:59,620
That's an ambient noise.

1511
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:02,060
I thought it was like an enemy.

1512
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:05,000
Are there any fish around?

1513
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:05,820
Are there any fishes in the water?

1514
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:08,960
I don't like how there just seems like no life in the water.

1515
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:10,120
Some house can't work things out.

1516
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:12,400
How if I'm such a beautiful place?

1517
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:14,260
But war makes it ugly.

1518
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:15,540
The blue door!

1519
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:17,040
That's gotta be the entrance.

1520
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:17,880
Let's go!

1521
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:19,580
That's where all the runics are, right?

1522
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:21,900
Careful, boy.

1523
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:23,540
What are they doing?

1524
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:26,100
What is happening there?

1525
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:27,360
Oh, shit!

1526
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:29,920
What's going on?

1527
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:36,220
Oh, they are invading it.

1528
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:38,920
Oh shit, where is my axe?

1529
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:42,500
That's fucking right.

1530
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:43,980
Oh shit, I missed!

1531
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,660
Wait, I upgraded it.

1532
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:46,460
Give me a sec.

1533
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,180
Wait, you can block?

1534
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:50,540
That's illegal.

1535
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:52,440
Wait, no!

1536
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:56,580
Please, I'm trying to use my new thing.

1537
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:57,920
Okay.

1538
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,780
Okay, now I'm angry.

1539
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,280
Now I'm angry!

1540
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:03,240
Now I'm angry!

1541
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:03,640
Please!

1542
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:04,700
I'm still angry!

1543
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:09,400
Okay, I got this.

1544
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:10,780
Shoot your arrow!

1545
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:13,160
I upgraded you for a reason!

1546
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:15,000
Alright, nice.

1547
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:18,200
There you go.

1548
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:20,460
Now I'm actually angry.

1549
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:23,860
Before then I was pretending angry, now I'm really angry.

1550
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:25,760
Alright.

1551
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:27,820
I guess we go this way then.

1552
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:30,260
If they prevented the... Oh, nope.

1553
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:31,700
Nope, I guess not.

1554
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:33,560
How do we get across?

1555
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:38,920
Do I just... How do we get down there though?

1556
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:41,540
Do we just jump down?

1557
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:44,500
What's that sound?

1558
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:50,280
Oh, it's the other dark elves!

1559
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:53,800
That's what the sounds were.

1560
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:55,780
Wait, can we get down there?

1561
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:56,920
Oh!

1562
01:12:58,260 --> 01:12:59,220
There's things here.

1563
01:13:02,380 --> 01:13:03,580
I don't know what this does.

1564
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:05,380
I assume it's like an elec- what?

1565
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:07,160
What did I do?

1566
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:09,740
Okay.

1567
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:13,680
It's like a bridge?

1568
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:15,200
Oh!

1569
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:15,500
Oh!

1570
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:15,940
Okay.

1571
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:17,980
Okay, don't worry.

1572
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:20,440
I learned a new thing.

1573
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:23,140
Okay, I'm blocking everything.

1574
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:24,980
Okay, fuck this.

1575
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:29,700
Now I'm... fuck this.

1576
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:30,920
Fuck gun!

1577
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:32,800
Alright, that's fine.

1578
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:36,120
That's fucking right.

1579
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:36,580
What are you gonna do?

1580
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:36,940
Blah.

1581
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:37,100
Oh!

1582
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:38,160
Okay, that's what you're gonna do.

1583
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:38,440
Okay.

1584
01:13:38,740 --> 01:13:39,560
That makes sense.

1585
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:41,900
That's fucking right.

1586
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:43,040
Fly away from this!

1587
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:45,800
Can't fly away from my fucking arms!

1588
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:46,140
Oh!

1589
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:48,220
Okay, you know, fuck you in particular.

1590
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:52,520
And that's how you do it.

1591
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:56,180
Alright.

1592
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:57,040
Alright, let's see.

1593
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:57,720
Oh!

1594
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:58,420
Update!

1595
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:00,920
Like to attack as a group.

1596
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:01,400
Alright.

1597
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:04,900
That's right.

1598
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:06,960
I gotta teach him a lesson.

1599
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:08,560
That one guy lesson.

1600
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:11,660
What am I doing?

1601
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:14,380
Is that a room?

1602
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:19,620
Oh!

1603
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:20,180
Okay.

1604
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:21,580
Back to the sand bowl I go.

1605
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:23,480
Boy, you just need to read harder.

1606
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:25,640
Alright.

1607
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:27,400
Oh!

1608
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:29,980
Activated and like stuff over here too!

1609
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:33,800
Sound time!

1610
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:35,240
Sound time!

1611
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:38,880
Alright.

1612
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:40,500
You see that, boy?

1613
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,320
This is what happens to magicians.

1614
01:14:45,020 --> 01:14:47,600
Told you to go to the gym with father.

1615
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:50,660
Instead you learn fucking magic.

1616
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:53,860
You see how that magic helped those dark elves?

1617
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:55,160
You see that?

1618
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:56,860
Now they're fucking dead.

1619
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:01,760
Alright, read, boy.

1620
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:03,220
Read.

1621
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:12,440
I told you reading was a mistake.

1622
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:16,960
Oh, the light elves.

1623
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:19,840
The light elves are asking for help.

1624
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:22,660
I do not care who they are nor what they want.

1625
01:15:22,660 --> 01:15:24,220
You never care about anything.

1626
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:25,700
You have something to say.

1627
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:29,960
Oh, he's fucking going through his...

1628
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:31,880
He's going through puberty right now.

1629
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:34,040
He's going through his rebellious stage.

1630
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:35,840
Damn.

1631
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:37,880
What's happening?

1632
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:40,880
Say it louder, boy.

1633
01:15:40,940 --> 01:15:42,400
Say it to my fucking face.

1634
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:46,820
There's just no other shit?

1635
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:49,140
Father?

1636
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:49,480
Yes?

1637
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:51,340
The voices I heard.

1638
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:53,460
It was hard to make out.

1639
01:15:53,540 --> 01:15:55,560
But way in the back I'm pretty sure I heard.

1640
01:15:56,020 --> 01:15:56,500
Mother.

1641
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:57,320
Huh?

1642
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:58,480
That is not possible.

1643
01:15:58,940 --> 01:15:59,420
Mother?

1644
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:00,160
Atreus.

1645
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:00,900
Enough.

1646
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:04,260
She's dead.

1647
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:05,340
We burned her together.

1648
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:11,220
You don't even have shoes, too.

1649
01:16:12,020 --> 01:16:13,080
That can't be good.

1650
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:15,380
Oh yeah, that's definitely not good.

1651
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:17,940
Who do I hate more?

1652
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:21,320
I gotta be sure.

1653
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:22,180
You know?

1654
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:23,880
I gotta be sure who I hate more.

1655
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:29,460
I need to know who I'm killing first.

1656
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:31,720
Oh shit.

1657
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:33,040
What the fuck did I do?

1658
01:16:33,420 --> 01:16:34,240
I don't know.

1659
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:34,420
Oh.

1660
01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:35,900
You can't fly.

1661
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:36,660
You're frozen.

1662
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:38,500
That's fucking right.

1663
01:16:38,780 --> 01:16:39,900
Oh, I need grab healers.

1664
01:16:40,940 --> 01:16:41,640
Oh fuck.

1665
01:16:41,820 --> 01:16:42,100
Okay.

1666
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:43,780
Nice.

1667
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:45,880
Oh no, I can't block.

1668
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:46,960
Okay.

1669
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:49,260
Okay, this is it.

1670
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:50,760
Yeah.

1671
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:51,960
Fuck you.

1672
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:53,580
That's fucking right.

1673
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:55,580
That's fucking right.

1674
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:56,640
That's fucking right.

1675
01:16:59,120 --> 01:16:59,640
Oh.

1676
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:01,420
Oh.

1677
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:02,820
Okay.

1678
01:17:03,740 --> 01:17:04,260
Oh.

1679
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:05,200
No, that's not block.

1680
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:07,680
Come on.

1681
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:09,340
Oh shit.

1682
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:09,980
No, yeah.

1683
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:10,560
Fuck you.

1684
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:14,820
Jesus.

1685
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:17,280
These executions are like so brutal.

1686
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:19,240
How did I make access?

1687
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:19,780
Explode?

1688
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:20,320
I don't know.

1689
01:17:22,140 --> 01:17:22,880
Mash button.

1690
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:23,940
Things die.

1691
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:27,040
Oh.

1692
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:28,520
Oh, wait.

1693
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:29,480
There's stuff behind me.

1694
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:32,520
Oh shit.

1695
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:33,740
You can deal with that, right?

1696
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:34,700
I'm gonna go loot.

1697
01:17:36,180 --> 01:17:36,780
Looting it.

1698
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:37,820
You see, boy.

1699
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:39,040
Looting is more important.

1700
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:40,840
Wait.

1701
01:17:40,980 --> 01:17:41,680
The fuck is that?

1702
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
How do I free it?

1703
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:44,720
Wait.

1704
01:17:44,740 --> 01:17:45,360
There's stuff here.

1705
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:49,220
Can I like...

1706
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:49,820
Oh shit.

1707
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:51,300
Oh my god.

1708
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:51,920
How did you guys get here?

1709
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:53,840
Okay.

1710
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:55,680
Oh.

1711
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:56,600
Oh no.

1712
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,320
Oh, that's a big boy.

1713
01:17:58,860 --> 01:18:00,480
That's a big boy.

1714
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:01,900
Oh god.

1715
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:03,080
Okay.

1716
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:05,820
Nice.

1717
01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:06,300
Don't worry.

1718
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:06,600
We're fine.

1719
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:07,280
We're so fine.

1720
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:08,080
We're so healthy.

1721
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:10,120
We are so healthy right now.

1722
01:18:11,580 --> 01:18:12,260
It's okay.

1723
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:14,800
I'm mashing every button I know.

1724
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:16,400
Can you guys tell?

1725
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:16,980
Okay.

1726
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:17,600
Okay.

1727
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:19,220
Okay.

1728
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:20,280
All right.

1729
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:21,640
And they're all dead.

1730
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:22,920
Nice.

1731
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:23,660
Wait.

1732
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:24,340
There's more?

1733
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:26,060
How is there more?

1734
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:28,780
Okay.

1735
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:29,620
Shoot your arrow.

1736
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:30,180
Shoot your arrow.

1737
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:32,840
And now I'm gonna fucking teach him a lesson.

1738
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:34,280
That's right.

1739
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:35,140
Where are your abs?

1740
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:35,500
Huh?

1741
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:39,240
How dare you not wear a shirt with no abs?

1742
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:41,380
That's fucking right.

1743
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:44,180
All right.

1744
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:45,760
Stay away from those cages.

1745
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:47,300
Can I free them?

1746
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:47,720
Yeah.

1747
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:49,560
Be ready.

1748
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:49,900
What?

1749
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:51,420
Be ready.

1750
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:51,880
I did it!

1751
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:52,520
Oh shit!

1752
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:53,240
They're bad people!

1753
01:18:53,940 --> 01:18:54,420
Okay.

1754
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:56,100
Never mind.

1755
01:18:56,620 --> 01:19:00,200
I legitimately thought they were gonna, you know, give me something, but I guess not.

1756
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:03,140
All right.

1757
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:03,440
Yay!

1758
01:19:05,660 --> 01:19:06,140
Wait.

1759
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:06,780
Chat's dead?

1760
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:07,860
Wait.

1761
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:08,980
How long has Chat been dead?

1762
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:11,540
I didn't even notice.

1763
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:16,100
How long has Chat been dead?

1764
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:17,700
Wait.

1765
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:19,700
Chat's been dead this whole time.

1766
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:20,060
Oops.

1767
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:25,200
I didn't even notice Chat's been dead this whole time.

1768
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:26,420
Oops.

1769
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:27,220
All right.

1770
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:28,080
Give me a sec.

1771
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:28,620
Let me...

1772
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:33,020
Let me put you guys back into the game.

1773
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:38,200
It's because of this new OBS update.

1774
01:19:38,420 --> 01:19:40,680
The new OBS update has, like, killed Chat.

1775
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:48,320
So, like, I always have to, like, fucking manually revive you guys every stream, but I'm not used to it.

1776
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:50,120
I'm not used to doing that.

1777
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:51,940
How do I get in there?

1778
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:54,520
I want to open the chest.

1779
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:55,500
What?

1780
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:56,500
Use your fucking magic.

1781
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:57,200
What's the point?

1782
01:19:58,840 --> 01:19:59,540
Oh, shit.

1783
01:19:59,580 --> 01:19:59,800
Nice.

1784
01:20:00,460 --> 01:20:01,060
Thank you.

1785
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:02,040
They're dead.

1786
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:02,600
It doesn't matter.

1787
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:06,320
Oh.

1788
01:20:06,460 --> 01:20:07,280
This way.

1789
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:09,600
Okay.

1790
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,260
That should open that, right?

1791
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:12,920
What?

1792
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:15,640
What did I destroy, then?

1793
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:17,200
Wait.

1794
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:18,360
Okay.

1795
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:18,720
Okay.

1796
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:21,080
Oh, it's coming back.

1797
01:20:22,780 --> 01:20:24,520
What's the angle?

1798
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:25,100
Oh!

1799
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:27,860
Okay.

1800
01:20:28,340 --> 01:20:29,040
Oh, no.

1801
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:29,680
That's just loot.

1802
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:33,080
Wait.

1803
01:20:33,140 --> 01:20:34,040
Then, how do I...

1804
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:35,340
Huh?

1805
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,820
How do I do this?

1806
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:43,860
There's apparently an angle?

1807
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:47,340
What?

1808
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:48,020
What?

1809
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:48,700
What?

1810
01:20:51,530 --> 01:20:53,170
I can't go through that.

1811
01:20:55,470 --> 01:20:56,610
Think, Doki.

1812
01:20:56,730 --> 01:20:57,010
Think!

1813
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:04,140
Okay.

1814
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:08,900
Okay.

1815
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:12,980
Oh!

1816
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:13,700
I have...

1817
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:13,840
Oh!

1818
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:14,820
I know!

1819
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:17,540
I know!

1820
01:21:17,660 --> 01:21:18,360
Watch this.

1821
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:23,500
Fucking knew it.

1822
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:25,900
I'm so goddamn smart.

1823
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:29,660
There we go.

1824
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:29,860
Okay.

1825
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:32,580
Let's go.

1826
01:21:32,580 --> 01:21:32,940
Nice.

1827
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:34,720
A heavy runic attack.

1828
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:38,220
That's called simple geometry.

1829
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:39,440
Yeah.

1830
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:39,920
That's right.

1831
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:41,240
I played Overwatch.

1832
01:21:43,780 --> 01:21:44,460
All right.

1833
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:45,120
Nice.

1834
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:48,160
I would like my free item, please.

1835
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:52,060
I wonder if they have stuff I can loot.

1836
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:55,940
I guess not.

1837
01:21:56,220 --> 01:21:58,000
I don't think there's any items in there.

1838
01:21:58,380 --> 01:21:59,060
All right.

1839
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:02,360
I guess we head over here.

1840
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:03,360
Come on, boy.

1841
01:22:04,340 --> 01:22:05,000
Come on.

1842
01:22:07,660 --> 01:22:09,700
Boy, you gotta get rid of your elf magic.

1843
01:22:11,540 --> 01:22:12,380
Oh, what's this?

1844
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:14,700
What's this over there?

1845
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:16,420
It's red.

1846
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:19,280
Okay.

1847
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:20,000
Let's see.

1848
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:21,680
I need to turn these cogs.

1849
01:22:24,890 --> 01:22:25,370
Okay.

1850
01:22:25,610 --> 01:22:26,910
And then...

1851
01:22:28,010 --> 01:22:28,910
And now...

1852
01:22:28,910 --> 01:22:30,850
Put it here?

1853
01:22:31,070 --> 01:22:31,230
Okay.

1854
01:22:31,250 --> 01:22:32,030
We will find out.

1855
01:22:33,050 --> 01:22:34,010
And then...

1856
01:22:34,010 --> 01:22:35,390
How do I get up?

1857
01:22:36,650 --> 01:22:37,770
Oh, did I fuck it up?

1858
01:22:40,310 --> 01:22:41,170
Brain hurt.

1859
01:22:44,010 --> 01:22:44,970
Is this...

1860
01:22:44,970 --> 01:22:45,210
Oh, no.

1861
01:22:45,250 --> 01:22:46,430
That's where I have to go.

1862
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:47,910
Okay.

1863
01:22:47,990 --> 01:22:48,670
And then...

1864
01:22:48,670 --> 01:22:48,770
No!

1865
01:22:50,630 --> 01:22:51,470
Oh, okay.

1866
01:22:53,190 --> 01:22:54,150
Very tricky.

1867
01:22:54,450 --> 01:22:54,930
Okay.

1868
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:56,130
Let's see.

1869
01:22:56,210 --> 01:22:58,610
I just need to do, like, tiny.

1870
01:22:59,670 --> 01:23:00,150
Okay.

1871
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:01,230
Okay.

1872
01:23:01,990 --> 01:23:02,430
Okay.

1873
01:23:04,190 --> 01:23:05,030
Is it tiny?

1874
01:23:05,290 --> 01:23:05,730
No.

1875
01:23:05,870 --> 01:23:06,810
We don't do tiny.

1876
01:23:07,630 --> 01:23:08,070
Okay.

1877
01:23:08,130 --> 01:23:09,210
And then...

1878
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:11,230
We push again.

1879
01:23:14,250 --> 01:23:14,690
Oh.

1880
01:23:15,550 --> 01:23:16,590
Put it in here.

1881
01:23:18,250 --> 01:23:18,690
Okay.

1882
01:23:18,710 --> 01:23:18,830
Oh.

1883
01:23:18,930 --> 01:23:19,270
Whoa.

1884
01:23:19,330 --> 01:23:19,570
No.

1885
01:23:19,650 --> 01:23:20,590
That's not what I wanted to do.

1886
01:23:20,890 --> 01:23:21,330
Okay.

1887
01:23:22,850 --> 01:23:23,690
Did we do it?

1888
01:23:25,010 --> 01:23:25,810
Oh, there we did.

1889
01:23:27,470 --> 01:23:28,390
That's fucking right.

1890
01:23:28,430 --> 01:23:28,850
Fuck you.

1891
01:23:29,930 --> 01:23:30,950
Where's the other seal?

1892
01:23:31,070 --> 01:23:31,210
Oh, there it is.

1893
01:23:31,210 --> 01:23:31,910
Oh.

1894
01:23:32,210 --> 01:23:33,890
We're missing one more seal.

1895
01:23:34,470 --> 01:23:35,850
How do we get over there?

1896
01:23:37,290 --> 01:23:37,850
Huh.

1897
01:23:43,130 --> 01:23:45,890
The last seal is, like, over here.

1898
01:23:47,270 --> 01:23:47,830
But...

1899
01:23:48,670 --> 01:23:51,010
How do we get high enough?

1900
01:23:54,580 --> 01:23:55,140
Huh?

1901
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:58,700
Is that not where the seal is at?

1902
01:23:58,840 --> 01:23:59,380
It's blue.

1903
01:24:03,770 --> 01:24:04,850
It's blue, though.

1904
01:24:06,070 --> 01:24:07,010
It's not blue?

1905
01:24:07,170 --> 01:24:07,470
Oh.

1906
01:24:07,750 --> 01:24:08,310
Okay.

1907
01:24:09,890 --> 01:24:11,290
We'll lower the platform.

1908
01:24:12,290 --> 01:24:12,850
Oh?

1909
01:24:15,410 --> 01:24:15,970
Wait.

1910
01:24:19,710 --> 01:24:20,270
Okay.

1911
01:24:24,620 --> 01:24:25,920
Is there anything in here?

1912
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:28,580
No?

1913
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:29,800
Okay.

1914
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:30,540
We'll lower again.

1915
01:24:34,420 --> 01:24:35,540
It's not the lower...

1916
01:24:35,540 --> 01:24:35,740
Oh, wait.

1917
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:38,560
I was like, why no turn?

1918
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:43,640
Is there anything behind me?

1919
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:44,320
Okay.

1920
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:47,960
Okay.

1921
01:24:47,980 --> 01:24:48,920
And lower even more?

1922
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:50,000
Okay.

1923
01:24:51,940 --> 01:24:52,860
Maybe it's here.

1924
01:24:54,140 --> 01:24:54,660
Oh!

1925
01:24:56,140 --> 01:24:56,660
No!

1926
01:24:58,860 --> 01:24:59,380
Wait.

1927
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:00,480
Can I lower even more?

1928
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:06,640
Okay.

1929
01:25:07,460 --> 01:25:07,980
No!

1930
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:13,060
Okay.

1931
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:13,860
I got this, guys.

1932
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:16,220
Yeah!

1933
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:18,360
Nice.

1934
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:20,080
I'm so smart.

1935
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:24,920
Now, if a regular player plays this game, they'll figure it out.

1936
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:25,020
Okay.

1937
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:25,920
I figured it out in, like, five hours.

1938
01:25:26,220 --> 01:25:28,580
I figured it out in, like, four hours.

1939
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:31,380
Yay!

1940
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:34,180
More HP!

1941
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:37,280
Okay.

1942
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:38,980
How do we get that?

1943
01:25:42,020 --> 01:25:42,500
Okay.

1944
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:42,600
Wait.

1945
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:43,760
Is there, like...

1946
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:46,880
Can I get that chest behind me?

1947
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:52,140
How do I get that?

1948
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:54,240
Up.

1949
01:25:54,340 --> 01:25:54,600
Up.

1950
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:55,000
Up.

1951
01:25:57,060 --> 01:25:57,620
Up.

1952
01:25:57,900 --> 01:25:58,460
Oh!

1953
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:00,460
Oh!

1954
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:02,660
Guys, did you know circles climb?

1955
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:06,160
Guys, I learned how to climb!

1956
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:14,220
You see, if you play the game, it takes you, like, six hours.

1957
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:18,120
When I play the game, it took me, like, five hours.

1958
01:26:18,220 --> 01:26:21,320
That's when you know I'm not like other gamers.

1959
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:22,240
Okay.

1960
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:27,080
Nice.

1961
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:27,820
All right.

1962
01:26:27,860 --> 01:26:28,020
Okay.

1963
01:26:28,860 --> 01:26:29,340
Yippee!

1964
01:26:31,660 --> 01:26:32,660
I'm so smart!

1965
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:37,640
Guys, I'm the fucking god of war, not god of wisdom.

1966
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:39,440
I'm just RPing.

1967
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:46,380
Oh, where did I come from?

1968
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:47,180
Oh, this way.

1969
01:26:48,220 --> 01:26:50,000
Guys, I'm just role-playing guys.

1970
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:51,880
I'm just being immersive.

1971
01:26:55,780 --> 01:26:56,260
Okay...

1972
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:57,960
What does this even...

1973
01:26:57,960 --> 01:26:58,000
Hey.

1974
01:26:58,020 --> 01:26:58,140
I didn't even turn.

1975
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:01,420
Why am I turning?

1976
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:09,300
There's like stuff in here.

1977
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:10,920
So that means like...

1978
01:27:11,620 --> 01:27:13,260
I might be able to break something?

1979
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:14,740
Like what did I do?

1980
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,560
What the fuck did I do?

1981
01:27:21,940 --> 01:27:23,300
Why did I open?

1982
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:28,060
Did I even open anything?

1983
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:29,680
Like I can't...

1984
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:34,860
Wait, what the fuck is that?

1985
01:27:35,740 --> 01:27:37,280
I looked at the wrong area.

1986
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:38,180
Okay, there you go.

1987
01:27:38,220 --> 01:27:39,800
I did open something.

1988
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:40,400
Okay.

1989
01:27:42,980 --> 01:27:43,460
Alright.

1990
01:27:45,380 --> 01:27:47,020
Sorry, I looked at the wrong place.

1991
01:27:47,140 --> 01:27:47,840
I didn't realize.

1992
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:51,880
Alright.

1993
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:52,620
Open sesame.

1994
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:55,200
Your god's not real.

1995
01:27:56,140 --> 01:27:56,620
Noink.

1996
01:27:58,720 --> 01:27:59,820
Reduces all damage.

1997
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:00,280
Oh yay!

1998
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:02,600
Nice.

1999
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:04,180
I wonder if like...

2000
01:28:04,180 --> 01:28:05,080
There's more stuff.

2001
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:06,380
Okay.

2002
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:10,580
Alright.

2003
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:12,380
Let's lower...

2004
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:13,480
Oh!

2005
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:15,980
I literally just lowered it back!

2006
01:28:17,260 --> 01:28:18,400
Oh, I can equip it!

2007
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:18,740
You're right!

2008
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:23,420
Where's the equipment thing?

2009
01:28:23,820 --> 01:28:25,900
Wait, what did I even get?

2010
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:28,060
This is like...

2011
01:28:28,740 --> 01:28:29,720
Is it like a...

2012
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:30,560
Oh, there it is.

2013
01:28:30,740 --> 01:28:31,320
There it is.

2014
01:28:34,740 --> 01:28:35,220
Oh, hello!

2015
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:41,380
Okay, line it up.

2016
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:44,380
Nice.

2017
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:46,480
What did I do?

2018
01:28:49,210 --> 01:28:50,410
What the fuck did I do?

2019
01:28:50,810 --> 01:28:51,650
Did I do this?

2020
01:28:51,830 --> 01:28:52,330
Oh, it's here.

2021
01:28:53,810 --> 01:28:55,230
Up you go, Arteus.

2022
01:28:55,790 --> 01:28:56,590
Oh shit!

2023
01:28:57,110 --> 01:28:59,250
Okay, that was pretty dumb of me.

2024
01:29:00,590 --> 01:29:01,590
Oh, thank god.

2025
01:29:01,810 --> 01:29:02,310
Oh shit!

2026
01:29:02,310 --> 01:29:03,090
Get him off!

2027
01:29:04,110 --> 01:29:04,890
I'm angry!

2028
01:29:09,610 --> 01:29:10,370
Get over here!

2029
01:29:10,750 --> 01:29:11,510
That's fucking right!

2030
01:29:11,590 --> 01:29:12,190
Off you go!

2031
01:29:12,690 --> 01:29:13,510
Off you go!

2032
01:29:14,330 --> 01:29:15,090
That's fucking right!

2033
01:29:15,170 --> 01:29:15,850
Off you go too!

2034
01:29:16,990 --> 01:29:17,550
That's right!

2035
01:29:18,110 --> 01:29:19,970
Even though you have wings, off you go!

2036
01:29:21,910 --> 01:29:23,410
Oh shit, you can fly back?

2037
01:29:26,030 --> 01:29:26,430
Where's that?

2038
01:29:28,010 --> 01:29:29,730
Oh my god, I can't believe it!

2039
01:29:29,730 --> 01:29:30,790
They can fly back!

2040
01:29:34,490 --> 01:29:37,830
I can't believe they used their fucking wings!

2041
01:29:38,650 --> 01:29:40,150
That should be illegal!

2042
01:29:42,350 --> 01:29:43,830
Is he gonna shoot him?

2043
01:29:43,990 --> 01:29:45,070
Shoot him, boy!

2044
01:29:45,910 --> 01:29:47,230
Fucking shoot him!

2045
01:29:48,690 --> 01:29:49,570
Shoot him!

2046
01:29:49,630 --> 01:29:50,490
What are you doing?

2047
01:29:51,030 --> 01:29:52,550
Just shoot him, boy!

2048
01:29:53,530 --> 01:29:55,390
Oh my god, boy!

2049
01:29:57,010 --> 01:29:58,690
Where's my fucking axe?

2050
01:30:00,150 --> 01:30:01,410
Boy, please!

2051
01:30:02,090 --> 01:30:02,770
Boy!

2052
01:30:03,070 --> 01:30:03,830
Boy, please!

2053
01:30:04,570 --> 01:30:06,270
Shoot your fucking gun!

2054
01:30:06,610 --> 01:30:07,610
Shoot your fucking gun!

2055
01:30:09,710 --> 01:30:11,290
How do I fight them?

2056
01:30:12,010 --> 01:30:13,250
What do you mean?

2057
01:30:13,830 --> 01:30:15,690
I can't go anywhere!

2058
01:30:17,150 --> 01:30:19,590
Oh, sorry, I make my own path.

2059
01:30:19,870 --> 01:30:21,830
Oh, sorry, I make my own path.

2060
01:30:21,830 --> 01:30:23,230
I forgot I could make my own path.

2061
01:30:23,230 --> 01:30:24,430
I have them literally so strong.

2062
01:30:26,110 --> 01:30:26,630
Boy!

2063
01:30:27,010 --> 01:30:29,670
Look, I wanted to see my boy fucking shoot him!

2064
01:30:30,270 --> 01:30:34,490
What's the point of learning these pussy ass elf magic if you can't shoot them?

2065
01:30:40,190 --> 01:30:42,270
Sorry, I forgot I was a god for a second.

2066
01:30:42,370 --> 01:30:42,530
Yeah.

2067
01:30:46,820 --> 01:30:48,300
Oh my- and you miss!

2068
01:30:48,580 --> 01:30:48,960
Okay.

2069
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:52,980
You could've shot them like five minutes ago when they were point blank.

2070
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:54,240
But now you miss.

2071
01:30:54,780 --> 01:30:55,680
It's alright, boy.

2072
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:00,100
I wish my daughter was still alive.

2073
01:31:04,660 --> 01:31:05,060
Alright.

2074
01:31:05,660 --> 01:31:06,420
Get down!

2075
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:07,680
Get the fuck down!

2076
01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:14,700
That's right, you shouldn't have fucking- That's right, you shouldn't have touched the ground!

2077
01:31:14,860 --> 01:31:15,820
This is my territory!

2078
01:31:16,940 --> 01:31:18,140
I rule here!

2079
01:31:19,660 --> 01:31:20,060
Alright.

2080
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:22,040
Wait, where did she go?

2081
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:24,900
Oh no, it's too- Too dark.

2082
01:31:26,980 --> 01:31:28,000
That's fucking right- Oh!

2083
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:29,360
Timed it wrong.

2084
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:32,740
I didn't know when that was- When that starts.

2085
01:31:33,580 --> 01:31:34,580
Alright, get down.

2086
01:31:35,420 --> 01:31:37,520
That's right, I'm gonna swat you like a mosquito.

2087
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:39,320
Get an electric fly swatter.

2088
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:42,400
Alright.

2089
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:44,260
Where do I go?

2090
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:48,980
This type seems stronger than the average dark elf.

2091
01:31:49,220 --> 01:31:52,120
They swing their heavy weapon so hard it creates a shockwave.

2092
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:52,540
Okay.

2093
01:31:56,020 --> 01:31:59,540
Yeah, I feel like I should've definitely invested in the shield counter.

2094
01:32:00,340 --> 01:32:00,780
Yeah, I feel like I should've definitely invested in the shield counter.

2095
01:32:00,780 --> 01:32:02,640
Yeah, I feel like I should've definitely invested in the shield counter.

2096
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:04,380
Hey, you sure the witch is okay?

2097
01:32:04,780 --> 01:32:06,500
I'd hate to think she died helping us.

2098
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:08,160
She knew what she was doing.

2099
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:09,460
Let's see...

2100
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:11,300
Oh, this is the right way.

2101
01:32:11,460 --> 01:32:13,920
Okay, that means I can explore more behind me, right?

2102
01:32:14,220 --> 01:32:15,120
Okay, that means I can explore more behind me, right?

2103
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:19,720
Let's see...

2104
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:22,700
Let me grab the shield counter.

2105
01:32:22,860 --> 01:32:23,680
Maybe you guys were right.

2106
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,440
Maybe I should've invested in the shield.

2107
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:29,420
Alright, which one was it?

2108
01:32:29,480 --> 01:32:30,500
Which one was the good one?

2109
01:32:31,260 --> 01:32:33,240
Oh my god, I have so many shield upgrades.

2110
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:34,000
Holy shit!

2111
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:35,840
Alright guys, which one is it?

2112
01:32:38,860 --> 01:32:39,920
Maybe a skill required.

2113
01:32:40,300 --> 01:32:40,960
Which one do I get?

2114
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:45,240
Yeah, but I don't want things where I have to use my hands.

2115
01:32:47,580 --> 01:32:49,220
Chat is never right.

2116
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:51,520
Axe only.

2117
01:32:52,220 --> 01:32:53,060
Is it this?

2118
01:32:53,180 --> 01:32:54,220
No, this is for...

2119
01:32:54,780 --> 01:32:55,680
Is it this one?

2120
01:32:56,780 --> 01:32:59,300
Is it the double tap to break an enemy?

2121
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,680
Or is it...

2122
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:02,460
Uh...

2123
01:33:04,060 --> 01:33:05,020
Alright, one...

2124
01:33:05,020 --> 01:33:06,560
While sprinting...

2125
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:08,020
Uh...

2126
01:33:08,020 --> 01:33:08,460
Oh!

2127
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:12,400
Okay, but that has to be bare-handed.

2128
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:13,120
I don't like that.

2129
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:15,960
I don't like the bare-handed one.

2130
01:33:16,580 --> 01:33:18,660
Blocking and protecting at the last second absorbs...

2131
01:33:19,220 --> 01:33:19,600
Oh, this one!

2132
01:33:21,580 --> 01:33:22,500
It's this one!

2133
01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:23,980
Okay.

2134
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:25,160
Alright.

2135
01:33:26,740 --> 01:33:28,860
That can help me block the projectile.

2136
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:30,480
Fuck faces.

2137
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:31,900
Oh, hey!

2138
01:33:32,620 --> 01:33:33,520
Nice, HP.

2139
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:36,200
Okay.

2140
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:42,300
Wait, where's the...

2141
01:33:44,860 --> 01:33:46,180
Where's your fucking...

2142
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:48,900
Uh, plaid thing?

2143
01:33:49,220 --> 01:33:50,420
It's not a plaid thing?

2144
01:33:50,580 --> 01:33:51,080
Or this?

2145
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:55,600
It's the plant that ties it together...

2146
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:56,180
Oh, here it is!

2147
01:33:57,400 --> 01:33:58,320
There you are.

2148
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:00,040
Wait, what?

2149
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:02,840
There's more of you?

2150
01:34:05,740 --> 01:34:06,340
Huh?

2151
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:12,080
There's more?

2152
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:16,640
Where is it growing from?

2153
01:34:18,420 --> 01:34:19,020
Wait...

2154
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:20,800
Where could it be growing from?

2155
01:34:23,540 --> 01:34:24,140
Okay...

2156
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:26,680
Is it...

2157
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:28,320
I literally only see one.

2158
01:34:30,420 --> 01:34:32,240
Where the fuck is the other one?

2159
01:34:35,220 --> 01:34:37,000
Where could it be growing from?

2160
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:41,640
There's nothing else glowing.

2161
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:43,640
Is there?

2162
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:46,060
Oh my god.

2163
01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:47,580
This is why I hate plants.

2164
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:53,620
Oh, hey!

2165
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:54,440
Loot!

2166
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:57,860
Is it up or...

2167
01:34:57,860 --> 01:34:59,520
Is it higher or lower?

2168
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:02,220
Oh, there it is!

2169
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:06,420
Okay, how the fuck do I do this?

2170
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:10,400
Okay...

2171
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:13,080
Okay...

2172
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:14,040
How the fuck?

2173
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:18,240
Okay...

2174
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:18,980
Uh...

2175
01:35:18,980 --> 01:35:19,020
Okay...

2176
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:19,520
Uh...

2177
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:21,380
Okay...

2178
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:22,080
I...

2179
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:24,260
I don't know.

2180
01:35:25,580 --> 01:35:27,120
Do I need like...

2181
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:28,300
A skill?

2182
01:35:30,540 --> 01:35:32,460
How the fuck do you do geometry?

2183
01:35:32,700 --> 01:35:32,940
Oh!

2184
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:35,420
Wait...

2185
01:35:36,850 --> 01:35:37,760
Recall it from here?

2186
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:38,740
Maybe?

2187
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:42,360
God damn it!

2188
01:35:42,420 --> 01:35:42,800
Okay...

2189
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:44,020
Oh, it curves!

2190
01:35:44,920 --> 01:35:46,040
It curves!

2191
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:49,160
Okay...

2192
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:52,060
Alright, I do this...

2193
01:35:52,060 --> 01:35:53,960
And then I do a little boomerang!

2194
01:35:55,340 --> 01:35:56,460
From here!

2195
01:35:59,940 --> 01:36:01,300
Okay, not from there.

2196
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:05,940
Okay, it's not from there.

2197
01:36:07,060 --> 01:36:08,260
Maybe like...

2198
01:36:08,620 --> 01:36:08,920
Here?

2199
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:11,920
And then...

2200
01:36:12,740 --> 01:36:13,340
Here.

2201
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:15,560
What the fuck?

2202
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:17,800
Alright, no, not from here.

2203
01:36:18,820 --> 01:36:19,420
Uh...

2204
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:21,980
Here?

2205
01:36:24,360 --> 01:36:26,780
And then we go from here?

2206
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:28,840
And then

2207
01:36:35,100 --> 01:36:35,100
we go from here?

2208
01:36:35,100 --> 01:36:35,280
And then we go from here?

2209
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:35,600
Not yeah!

2210
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:37,660
Nevermind, not yeah.

2211
01:36:37,940 --> 01:36:38,240
Not...

2212
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:38,500
Not yeah.

2213
01:36:38,740 --> 01:36:44,160
Okay, from here...

2214
01:36:45,030 --> 01:36:47,180
And then...

2215
01:36:47,180 --> 01:36:48,640
And then...

2216
01:36:51,740 --> 01:36:52,200
Here.

2217
01:36:53,930 --> 01:36:54,980
God fucking...

2218
01:36:54,980 --> 01:36:55,480
Okay...

2219
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,340
I shall learn geometry!

2220
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:01,840
I shall learn geometry!

2221
01:37:03,340 --> 01:37:03,760
Here!

2222
01:37:04,180 --> 01:37:04,320
Okay...

2223
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:04,800
Here!

2224
01:37:06,100 --> 01:37:07,700
And then...

2225
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:15,320
Right here.

2226
01:37:16,540 --> 01:37:18,080
That has to be it.

2227
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:20,000
I did it!

2228
01:37:20,260 --> 01:37:23,160
I think I brute-forced it, but...

2229
01:37:23,160 --> 01:37:24,000
I think I brute-forced it, but...

2230
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,180
If it works, it works.

2231
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:27,860
Fucking geometry.

2232
01:37:27,860 --> 01:37:28,160
Geometry.

2233
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:30,040
That's right.

2234
01:37:31,460 --> 01:37:32,480
I did it.

2235
01:37:35,740 --> 01:37:36,740
Alright, here we go.

2236
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:39,920
I don't know if I actually brute-forced it or if I did it correctly.

2237
01:37:44,120 --> 01:37:44,580
Alright.

2238
01:37:46,740 --> 01:37:47,760
Here we go.

2239
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:50,380
First try.

2240
01:37:54,460 --> 01:37:55,360
Simple geometry.

2241
01:37:55,860 --> 01:37:56,060
Ooh!

2242
01:37:56,820 --> 01:37:58,460
What's that red glowing light over there?

2243
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:00,160
Is it dangerous?

2244
01:38:00,740 --> 01:38:01,320
More of it.

2245
01:38:02,420 --> 01:38:03,320
Oh, bullying!

2246
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:04,680
Okay.

2247
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:06,180
Bullying time!

2248
01:38:06,640 --> 01:38:09,280
If we cut enough away, the bridge above us should reappear.

2249
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:10,240
Right.

2250
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:12,440
This way.

2251
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:13,800
Right.

2252
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:15,880
If it works, it works, guys.

2253
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:17,620
See?

2254
01:38:18,260 --> 01:38:20,120
It doesn't matter if I almost failed math.

2255
01:38:23,660 --> 01:38:25,240
Anybody can solve this.

2256
01:38:27,340 --> 01:38:28,300
This shit's for babies.

2257
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:33,440
If they didn't think of a 10, give this shit a sticky thank you!

2258
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:34,580
If they didn't think of a 10, give this shit a sticky thank you!

2259
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:36,220
Where did I go?

2260
01:38:36,620 --> 01:38:37,180
Oh, here.

2261
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:40,840
It's not in yellow paint, so it's hard to figure out where to go.

2262
01:38:41,980 --> 01:38:43,120
Alright, this way.

2263
01:38:45,540 --> 01:38:46,300
Here we go.

2264
01:38:48,020 --> 01:38:48,880
Oh shit, no.

2265
01:38:49,060 --> 01:38:49,680
More elves.

2266
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:50,980
It's fucking right.

2267
01:38:52,100 --> 01:38:53,060
Oh shit!

2268
01:38:54,380 --> 01:38:55,140
Don't worry.

2269
01:38:55,880 --> 01:38:58,100
Don't worry, I upgraded my shit!

2270
01:38:58,520 --> 01:39:00,100
I don't just use guns!

2271
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:03,180
But sometimes guns is the right thing to use.

2272
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:04,400
Oh, nice.

2273
01:39:04,540 --> 01:39:04,800
HP.

2274
01:39:06,340 --> 01:39:07,260
Above me?

2275
01:39:07,340 --> 01:39:07,920
Oh, fuck!

2276
01:39:09,460 --> 01:39:10,420
Okay, don't worry.

2277
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:12,440
Nice.

2278
01:39:13,980 --> 01:39:15,440
Okay, and now I'm angy.

2279
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:18,800
That's fucking right.

2280
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:20,680
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew!

2281
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:24,080
Oh, fuck!

2282
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:25,200
Okay, that's how I meant.

2283
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:25,700
Sorry.

2284
01:39:25,900 --> 01:39:27,380
Did not mean to get angry there.

2285
01:39:29,820 --> 01:39:30,680
Alright, fuck you.

2286
01:39:31,340 --> 01:39:31,940
Fuck you!

2287
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:33,600
That's right.

2288
01:39:33,780 --> 01:39:34,800
Try and fly from that!

2289
01:39:36,240 --> 01:39:37,040
You can't!

2290
01:39:37,900 --> 01:39:38,780
Wait, where did he go?

2291
01:39:41,320 --> 01:39:41,900
Wait, what?

2292
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:44,360
Where is he?

2293
01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:47,500
There's still fucking...

2294
01:39:48,220 --> 01:39:48,980
angry music.

2295
01:39:51,060 --> 01:39:51,840
Who's angry?

2296
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:53,100
Oh, you're angry!

2297
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:54,180
Oh, you're just stuck!

2298
01:39:54,460 --> 01:39:57,900
I was like, who's angry right now?

2299
01:39:58,120 --> 01:39:58,940
Oh, shit!

2300
01:39:59,300 --> 01:39:59,820
Rocks?

2301
01:40:02,120 --> 01:40:03,040
Good question!

2302
01:40:04,820 --> 01:40:05,700
Oh, shit!

2303
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:07,540
Shoot it!

2304
01:40:07,640 --> 01:40:08,240
Shoot it!

2305
01:40:10,460 --> 01:40:10,980
Oh!

2306
01:40:12,660 --> 01:40:13,660
What is he doing?

2307
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:17,900
Shoot the rock!

2308
01:40:18,340 --> 01:40:18,860
Shoot the rock!

2309
01:40:20,420 --> 01:40:20,900
What?

2310
01:40:21,340 --> 01:40:21,820
Oh!

2311
01:40:21,880 --> 01:40:24,740
My pain is not your concern!

2312
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:25,680
Oh!

2313
01:40:27,180 --> 01:40:28,520
Do I just...

2314
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:31,780
Throw your knife!

2315
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:34,730
Throw your... Oh my god!

2316
01:40:34,830 --> 01:40:35,250
Okay!

2317
01:40:38,290 --> 01:40:38,770
Okay.

2318
01:40:39,370 --> 01:40:39,990
Come on!

2319
01:40:40,430 --> 01:40:41,250
Do the thing!

2320
01:40:41,270 --> 01:40:41,750
Do the thing!

2321
01:40:42,150 --> 01:40:43,270
That's fucking right!

2322
01:40:45,110 --> 01:40:46,190
That's fucking right!

2323
01:40:46,210 --> 01:40:47,350
Why is it not working?

2324
01:40:50,450 --> 01:40:51,190
Oh, shit!

2325
01:40:51,270 --> 01:40:51,970
I need my heals!

2326
01:40:52,490 --> 01:40:53,190
There we go!

2327
01:40:55,330 --> 01:40:55,770
Alright.

2328
01:40:56,730 --> 01:40:57,370
Shoot it!

2329
01:40:57,430 --> 01:40:57,790
Shoot it!

2330
01:40:57,830 --> 01:40:58,230
Shoot it!

2331
01:41:00,410 --> 01:41:01,010
Here we go!

2332
01:41:01,530 --> 01:41:02,150
Here we go!

2333
01:41:02,550 --> 01:41:04,150
I found the perfect cover!

2334
01:41:04,670 --> 01:41:05,210
That's right!

2335
01:41:05,310 --> 01:41:06,250
You can't do shit now!

2336
01:41:07,350 --> 01:41:08,390
That's fucking right!

2337
01:41:08,790 --> 01:41:10,070
I'm always fighting!

2338
01:41:10,290 --> 01:41:10,650
Jeez!

2339
01:41:12,070 --> 01:41:13,190
Get out of here!

2340
01:41:14,490 --> 01:41:14,910
Oh!

2341
01:41:17,130 --> 01:41:18,650
I'll fucking punch you in the heart!

2342
01:41:20,310 --> 01:41:20,990
Oh, no!

2343
01:41:21,950 --> 01:41:22,510
That's right!

2344
01:41:22,550 --> 01:41:23,190
What are you gonna do now?

2345
01:41:23,490 --> 01:41:23,910
Huh?

2346
01:41:24,050 --> 01:41:24,970
What you gonna do now?

2347
01:41:25,890 --> 01:41:26,310
Nothing!

2348
01:41:28,030 --> 01:41:28,450
Nothing!

2349
01:41:28,710 --> 01:41:29,250
That's right!

2350
01:41:29,490 --> 01:41:30,470
You can't walk forward!

2351
01:41:31,690 --> 01:41:32,410
Oh, shit!

2352
01:41:33,250 --> 01:41:34,710
Not open your fucking heart!

2353
01:41:35,170 --> 01:41:35,970
This is not fair!

2354
01:41:36,070 --> 01:41:36,830
This is actually not fair!

2355
01:41:40,050 --> 01:41:40,470
Alright.

2356
01:41:41,110 --> 01:41:41,530
Alright.

2357
01:41:43,190 --> 01:41:43,750
Open your heart!

2358
01:41:44,790 --> 01:41:45,870
That's fucking right!

2359
01:41:48,930 --> 01:41:50,570
Easiest shit of my life!

2360
01:41:50,910 --> 01:41:52,650
Can't walk forward, nerd!

2361
01:41:54,310 --> 01:41:54,830
Yeah!

2362
01:41:54,890 --> 01:41:56,490
Elf magic can't save you now!

2363
01:41:57,610 --> 01:41:58,570
Reduces all damage!

2364
01:41:58,650 --> 01:41:58,970
Oh, hey!

2365
01:41:59,070 --> 01:42:00,090
Reduces damage again!

2366
01:42:00,910 --> 01:42:01,430
Nice!

2367
01:42:02,390 --> 01:42:03,170
Oh my god!

2368
01:42:03,210 --> 01:42:04,030
That's a lot of shit!

2369
01:42:04,210 --> 01:42:04,410
Oh!

2370
01:42:05,830 --> 01:42:06,770
Now I see that!

2371
01:42:07,450 --> 01:42:07,970
Alright!

2372
01:42:08,010 --> 01:42:08,450
Shoot him!

2373
01:42:09,650 --> 01:42:10,170
Yeah!

2374
01:42:12,930 --> 01:42:13,490
Okay!

2375
01:42:15,490 --> 01:42:16,270
Fucking right!

2376
01:42:16,310 --> 01:42:17,290
Should've went to the gym!

2377
01:42:17,490 --> 01:42:19,270
Instead of relying on elf magic!

2378
01:42:20,370 --> 01:42:20,930
Nice!

2379
01:42:20,930 --> 01:42:21,410
We did it!

2380
01:42:23,710 --> 01:42:27,530
I have brute force!

2381
01:42:27,630 --> 01:42:28,890
I use my brain!

2382
01:42:29,990 --> 01:42:31,430
Light runic attack!

2383
01:42:32,270 --> 01:42:33,770
Clears out surrounding...

2384
01:42:33,770 --> 01:42:33,830
Oh!

2385
01:42:35,030 --> 01:42:35,670
Oh, hey!

2386
01:42:35,690 --> 01:42:36,150
That's good!

2387
01:42:36,450 --> 01:42:37,290
Oh, I'm broke!

2388
01:42:37,610 --> 01:42:38,990
Am I still broke?!

2389
01:42:40,390 --> 01:42:40,910
Oh!

2390
01:42:41,710 --> 01:42:43,270
Wait, I just never equipped it!

2391
01:42:43,390 --> 01:42:43,570
Oops!

2392
01:42:46,150 --> 01:42:46,670
Okay...

2393
01:42:48,070 --> 01:42:50,370
Rapidly spinning attack that clears out...

2394
01:42:50,370 --> 01:42:51,530
A quick...

2395
01:42:52,750 --> 01:42:53,270
Uh...

2396
01:42:54,150 --> 01:42:55,430
With a follow-up...

2397
01:42:55,430 --> 01:42:56,610
Extremely burst of...

2398
01:42:56,610 --> 01:42:57,850
Oh, actually, I think this...

2399
01:42:57,850 --> 01:43:01,250
Honestly, I think this is my favorite so far.

2400
01:43:02,870 --> 01:43:03,390
Wait!

2401
01:43:03,850 --> 01:43:04,750
4 damage!

2402
01:43:04,910 --> 01:43:05,430
Never mind!

2403
01:43:05,490 --> 01:43:06,390
This is my favorite!

2404
01:43:07,270 --> 01:43:07,830
Ungabunga!

2405
01:43:09,170 --> 01:43:09,730
Huh?

2406
01:43:11,490 --> 01:43:12,050
Huh?

2407
01:43:13,790 --> 01:43:14,630
Mega chop!

2408
01:43:15,770 --> 01:43:17,610
Mega chop didn't win?!

2409
01:43:18,610 --> 01:43:19,170
Oh!

2410
01:43:19,190 --> 01:43:19,410
I...

2411
01:43:19,410 --> 01:43:19,710
Oh!

2412
01:43:19,790 --> 01:43:20,570
I already chopped it!

2413
01:43:23,770 --> 01:43:24,330
Ooh!

2414
01:43:33,620 --> 01:43:34,180
Yeah!

2415
01:43:36,860 --> 01:43:38,060
I made a bridge!

2416
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:40,720
I did it!

2417
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:42,100
I brought the light!

2418
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:42,280
Wait!

2419
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:44,280
See?

2420
01:43:44,460 --> 01:43:46,460
If the boy calls me smart, I am smart.

2421
01:43:47,900 --> 01:43:49,760
What if I can, like, grab more arrows?

2422
01:43:50,220 --> 01:43:52,520
Didn't the witch give me...

2423
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:54,380
How do I get to here?

2424
01:43:56,840 --> 01:43:57,320
Okay...

2425
01:43:58,100 --> 01:44:00,840
I wanna open this so I can grab the loot.

2426
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:01,680
I wanna open this so I can grab the loot.

2427
01:44:01,680 --> 01:44:03,420
I don't know how to open it.

2428
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:06,120
How the fuck do I open doors?

2429
01:44:10,260 --> 01:44:11,560
How the fuck do I open doors?

2430
01:44:11,560 --> 01:44:11,880
Oh, wait.

2431
01:44:12,100 --> 01:44:12,500
Unless...

2432
01:44:14,140 --> 01:44:15,420
Why does my axe not go through?

2433
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:17,280
Boy!

2434
01:44:17,300 --> 01:44:18,060
Get in there, boy!

2435
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:19,540
Boy, you fit!

2436
01:44:23,320 --> 01:44:24,340
Boy, I can...

2437
01:44:24,340 --> 01:44:26,220
I know you fit under...

2438
01:44:26,220 --> 01:44:27,460
I know you fit that gate!

2439
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:31,160
Boy, I need that chest!

2440
01:44:31,300 --> 01:44:33,100
Crawl under that gate right now!

2441
01:44:37,830 --> 01:44:38,790
Alright, up we go.

2442
01:44:39,930 --> 01:44:40,770
Yeah, you thought...

2443
01:44:40,770 --> 01:44:41,550
You think I don't know?

2444
01:44:41,650 --> 01:44:42,910
I know you fucking fit under that gate.

2445
01:44:42,930 --> 01:44:44,530
You think I don't know?

2446
01:44:44,750 --> 01:44:46,350
I know what size you are!

2447
01:44:49,970 --> 01:44:51,110
Boy, he don't bite!

2448
01:44:51,370 --> 01:44:52,090
It's like a dog!

2449
01:44:53,970 --> 01:44:55,290
The blue door.

2450
01:44:58,270 --> 01:44:59,510
Okay, this way.

2451
01:45:04,830 --> 01:45:07,610
Oh, it's so pretty!

2452
01:45:08,350 --> 01:45:09,850
I really love the graphics.

2453
01:45:12,930 --> 01:45:13,810
We have a problem.

2454
01:45:14,170 --> 01:45:15,870
What do you mean by there's no seam?

2455
01:45:16,310 --> 01:45:17,750
Oh, I can't open it!

2456
01:45:19,850 --> 01:45:20,370
Unless...

2457
01:45:21,950 --> 01:45:23,510
If I caress it enough...

2458
01:45:23,510 --> 01:45:24,710
These doors do not open.

2459
01:45:24,990 --> 01:45:25,450
Hello?

2460
01:45:25,770 --> 01:45:27,290
If I say something nice to it...

2461
01:45:27,290 --> 01:45:28,130
Hello?

2462
01:45:30,850 --> 01:45:32,010
Hey there, pretty girl.

2463
01:45:32,830 --> 01:45:36,050
Have I ever told you that you're the most beautiful door out there?

2464
01:45:36,530 --> 01:45:37,450
Have I ever told you that you're the most beautiful door out there?

2465
01:45:37,450 --> 01:45:37,910
Have I ever told you that you're the most beautiful door out there?

2466
01:45:39,210 --> 01:45:42,050
If I caress it enough, maybe it'll open.

2467
01:45:46,230 --> 01:45:46,950
Oh, hey!

2468
01:45:47,390 --> 01:45:48,090
Oh, hey!

2469
01:45:48,330 --> 01:45:49,510
Wait, how did you get here?

2470
01:45:50,490 --> 01:45:51,830
Oh my god, Lore!

2471
01:45:52,390 --> 01:45:53,330
Boy, read.

2472
01:45:54,750 --> 01:45:56,070
It's time to read, boy.

2473
01:45:56,590 --> 01:45:56,890
It's time to read, boy.

2474
01:45:56,890 --> 01:45:57,890
There's giants and sorcerers.

2475
01:46:00,190 --> 01:46:02,750
Negative risk closes even more.

2476
01:46:03,310 --> 01:46:03,450
Negative risk closes even more.

2477
01:46:06,690 --> 01:46:08,290
Did Odin kill her for her book?

2478
01:46:09,370 --> 01:46:10,130
Hey, door.

2479
01:46:10,130 --> 01:46:11,810
You wanna open your...

2480
01:46:17,820 --> 01:46:19,870
You wanna open your hinges?

2481
01:46:20,110 --> 01:46:21,450
Spread your hinges for me?

2482
01:46:26,790 --> 01:46:28,190
Hey there.

2483
01:46:29,670 --> 01:46:30,610
You wanna...

2484
01:46:30,610 --> 01:46:33,730
You wanna spread your hinges for me?

2485
01:46:33,910 --> 01:46:36,170
So I can go inside...

2486
01:46:40,490 --> 01:46:41,130
Okay.

2487
01:46:42,470 --> 01:46:43,870
It's a fucking door!

2488
01:46:44,090 --> 01:46:44,810
What do you mean?

2489
01:46:45,750 --> 01:46:47,190
We need call HR!

2490
01:46:47,470 --> 01:46:48,530
It's a fucking door!

2491
01:46:49,630 --> 01:46:52,050
Did you kill an ancient?

2492
01:46:52,190 --> 01:46:52,590
Yes.

2493
01:46:52,870 --> 01:46:55,010
Was it difficult?

2494
01:46:55,290 --> 01:46:55,670
Yes.

2495
01:46:55,890 --> 01:46:58,750
Is that all you're going to give me?

2496
01:46:58,790 --> 01:46:59,030
Yes.

2497
01:47:00,650 --> 01:47:03,770
Never dirty talk a door.

2498
01:47:03,950 --> 01:47:04,450
Let's do it.

2499
01:47:05,850 --> 01:47:07,830
What are you talking about?

2500
01:47:07,830 --> 01:47:11,410
I'm just trying to get the door to open up!

2501
01:47:11,690 --> 01:47:12,970
That's all I want!

2502
01:47:15,770 --> 01:47:18,030
Ew, I'm not fucking upgrading your shit.

2503
01:47:18,330 --> 01:47:20,430
Boy, you don't deserve that.

2504
01:47:23,910 --> 01:47:25,850
I'm just gonna wait for better upgrades.

2505
01:47:26,330 --> 01:47:27,810
Baby, you're not like other door.

2506
01:47:34,270 --> 01:47:35,370
Hater, baby door.

2507
01:47:39,510 --> 01:47:40,430
Oh, is that it?

2508
01:47:51,730 --> 01:47:53,010
Alright, let's go this way.

2509
01:47:53,690 --> 01:47:54,610
Is this the right way?

2510
01:47:54,750 --> 01:47:55,990
Oh wait, no, this is the right way.

2511
01:47:56,170 --> 01:47:57,150
But there's like another entrance.

2512
01:47:59,790 --> 01:48:00,630
Is this the entrance?

2513
01:48:01,070 --> 01:48:01,670
I can't tell.

2514
01:48:02,410 --> 01:48:03,650
There's like so many pathways.

2515
01:48:05,410 --> 01:48:07,710
Let me ring your doorbell.

2516
01:48:10,470 --> 01:48:11,870
Oh yeah, there is another.

2517
01:48:20,820 --> 01:48:21,860
What's this for?

2518
01:48:23,080 --> 01:48:23,720
Oh!

2519
01:48:26,360 --> 01:48:26,680
Okay.

2520
01:48:28,820 --> 01:48:29,460
So...

2521
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:32,420
Where is it heading to though?

2522
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:35,080
Like, where's the other one?

2523
01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:38,600
Wait, where's the... is it up here?

2524
01:48:40,660 --> 01:48:44,620
Is that your... no, are you just happy to see me?

2525
01:48:45,100 --> 01:48:47,080
Thank you for the super chat.

2526
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:48,740
Thank you, thank you.

2527
01:48:49,060 --> 01:48:51,260
I'm trying to figure out like, um...

2528
01:48:52,380 --> 01:48:56,140
Where the other thing I'm supposed to cut?

2529
01:48:59,300 --> 01:49:02,900
Like, what is... what is the next thing I'm supposed to cut?

2530
01:49:04,340 --> 01:49:05,840
That's the thing, I don't know...

2531
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:06,500
This?

2532
01:49:06,500 --> 01:49:06,780
This?

2533
01:49:09,300 --> 01:49:10,360
I can't tell.

2534
01:49:10,700 --> 01:49:11,600
Is it that?

2535
01:49:14,040 --> 01:49:15,360
What the fuck is...

2536
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:16,200
Oh, it's that!

2537
01:49:16,780 --> 01:49:18,380
Oh, okay, I see.

2538
01:49:18,520 --> 01:49:20,920
Sorry, I don't know how to look right.

2539
01:49:21,320 --> 01:49:22,640
I see it now.

2540
01:49:23,060 --> 01:49:23,740
There we go.

2541
01:49:24,180 --> 01:49:26,380
Sorry, I didn't know which door I...

2542
01:49:26,380 --> 01:49:27,780
I didn't look right.

2543
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:31,740
Sorry, my eyes are only for one door, guys.

2544
01:49:32,820 --> 01:49:36,120
Guys, I only have eyes for one door, chat.

2545
01:49:36,120 --> 01:49:37,500
Like...

2546
01:49:38,040 --> 01:49:40,940
You really think I was gonna cheat on that door?

2547
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:45,700
After everything we've been through?

2548
01:49:49,170 --> 01:49:50,010
Alright.

2549
01:49:50,570 --> 01:49:52,090
Let's see...

2550
01:49:53,390 --> 01:49:54,230
Guys...

2551
01:49:54,230 --> 01:49:55,610
It's monogamy.

2552
01:49:58,630 --> 01:50:05,050
Guys, that door is made of monogamy.

2553
01:50:08,570 --> 01:50:09,650
Let's see...

2554
01:50:10,230 --> 01:50:10,790
Alright.

2555
01:50:11,090 --> 01:50:12,210
I think we got everything.

2556
01:50:13,690 --> 01:50:14,610
I think so?

2557
01:50:14,770 --> 01:50:14,910
Yeah.

2558
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:21,520
Alright.

2559
01:50:21,620 --> 01:50:22,380
We go this way.

2560
01:50:26,380 --> 01:50:27,500
Let's see...

2561
01:50:29,140 --> 01:50:29,820
Here we go.

2562
01:50:32,360 --> 01:50:33,740
You will not...

2563
01:50:33,740 --> 01:50:35,280
You would knock on more than one door.

2564
01:50:35,320 --> 01:50:35,920
I would never!

2565
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,500
My eyes are for that door only.

2566
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:39,620
You would knock on more than one door only.

2567
01:50:41,940 --> 01:50:43,460
You would knock on more than one door only.

2568
01:50:43,460 --> 01:50:44,180
Of course.

2569
01:50:44,500 --> 01:50:45,420
Oh, wait.

2570
01:50:45,460 --> 01:50:46,100
He was just...

2571
01:50:46,100 --> 01:50:46,840
He was cutscene.

2572
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:54,440
He was cutscene.

2573
01:50:54,440 --> 01:50:55,380
No, it was cutscene!

2574
01:50:55,540 --> 01:50:56,840
I did not miss!

2575
01:50:56,960 --> 01:50:57,080
I did not miss!

2576
01:50:57,920 --> 01:50:58,520
Okay.

2577
01:50:59,060 --> 01:50:59,840
You know what?

2578
01:50:59,880 --> 01:51:00,260
Fuck this.

2579
01:51:00,300 --> 01:51:00,680
I'm angry.

2580
01:51:01,060 --> 01:51:02,480
I'm gonna go straight to you.

2581
01:51:02,580 --> 01:51:03,140
I'm gonna go straight to you.

2582
01:51:03,140 --> 01:51:03,520
Straight to you!

2583
01:51:04,120 --> 01:51:05,320
That's fucking right!

2584
01:51:05,380 --> 01:51:06,120
Dodge this!

2585
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:07,360
That's fucking right!

2586
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:08,980
Fucking dodge this bitch!

2587
01:51:09,460 --> 01:51:10,060
Fucking dodge this bitch!

2588
01:51:10,240 --> 01:51:10,960
That's right.

2589
01:51:11,120 --> 01:51:11,600
World star!

2590
01:51:12,340 --> 01:51:13,320
World star!

2591
01:51:14,180 --> 01:51:14,880
Oh!

2592
01:51:15,160 --> 01:51:15,600
Oh!

2593
01:51:15,620 --> 01:51:16,800
Sorry, I did not mean that.

2594
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:18,520
Oh.

2595
01:51:19,360 --> 01:51:20,720
Oh, I can't dodge that?

2596
01:51:21,440 --> 01:51:22,400
This fucking sucks.

2597
01:51:23,060 --> 01:51:24,040
Get down from here.

2598
01:51:24,220 --> 01:51:24,920
Get down!

2599
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:26,400
Fight me like a real man!

2600
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:28,060
Even though you're an elf!

2601
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:30,400
Come on!

2602
01:51:31,280 --> 01:51:32,600
Get down from here!

2603
01:51:33,260 --> 01:51:35,480
I'll fucking swat you with my electric swatter!

2604
01:51:37,220 --> 01:51:38,000
Doki smash!

2605
01:51:40,200 --> 01:51:40,640
Phew!

2606
01:51:41,100 --> 01:51:41,780
There you go.

2607
01:51:42,260 --> 01:51:42,880
He's dead.

2608
01:51:44,180 --> 01:51:44,540
All right.

2609
01:51:45,660 --> 01:51:46,780
What the fuck?

2610
01:51:48,120 --> 01:51:48,560
What?

2611
01:51:49,600 --> 01:51:51,100
Okay, we gotta figure this out.

2612
01:51:51,880 --> 01:51:53,300
This one is able to call...

2613
01:51:53,300 --> 01:51:53,840
Oh, okay.

2614
01:51:53,960 --> 01:51:54,360
Yeah.

2615
01:51:54,520 --> 01:51:56,400
That was a good move by me then.

2616
01:51:56,740 --> 01:51:57,420
All right.

2617
01:51:57,580 --> 01:51:59,520
That has to go down, right?

2618
01:52:00,780 --> 01:52:01,220
No?

2619
01:52:03,720 --> 01:52:04,160
Okay.

2620
01:52:04,260 --> 01:52:04,720
Oh, I know.

2621
01:52:05,200 --> 01:52:06,500
It has to be the heavy attack.

2622
01:52:09,160 --> 01:52:10,120
How did I miss?

2623
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:14,100
Wait, maybe a lighter throw?

2624
01:52:14,140 --> 01:52:14,160
I don't know.

2625
01:52:14,160 --> 01:52:15,100
What?

2626
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:17,500
Maybe like this?

2627
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:18,300
No.

2628
01:52:19,160 --> 01:52:19,720
Okay.

2629
01:52:19,820 --> 01:52:20,400
Oh, higher.

2630
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:21,380
Maybe if I do higher.

2631
01:52:22,060 --> 01:52:22,620
Okay.

2632
01:52:22,660 --> 01:52:23,240
That's too high.

2633
01:52:23,400 --> 01:52:25,120
Maybe if I do just a little higher.

2634
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:27,880
Other angle?

2635
01:52:29,380 --> 01:52:30,220
There's more...

2636
01:52:30,220 --> 01:52:33,220
All right.

2637
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:34,500
Let's see.

2638
01:52:35,660 --> 01:52:37,280
How do I do on the other angle?

2639
01:52:39,380 --> 01:52:40,500
Like this?

2640
01:52:42,760 --> 01:52:43,320
No?

2641
01:52:43,580 --> 01:52:44,140
Okay.

2642
01:52:44,840 --> 01:52:45,440
What?

2643
01:52:47,640 --> 01:52:48,240
What?

2644
01:52:49,960 --> 01:52:50,560
Okay.

2645
01:52:51,140 --> 01:52:52,260
Maybe like this?

2646
01:52:55,460 --> 01:52:56,060
Oh!

2647
01:52:57,260 --> 01:52:57,860
Okay.

2648
01:52:57,940 --> 01:52:58,460
I got two.

2649
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:02,160
Oh!

2650
01:53:02,160 --> 01:53:03,480
I think I got it!

2651
01:53:05,360 --> 01:53:05,960
No.

2652
01:53:06,080 --> 01:53:06,380
Okay.

2653
01:53:09,860 --> 01:53:10,460
No?

2654
01:53:14,680 --> 01:53:15,280
Oh.

2655
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:16,440
Okay.

2656
01:53:16,460 --> 01:53:16,760
No.

2657
01:53:19,780 --> 01:53:20,760
Okay.

2658
01:53:21,200 --> 01:53:22,780
I made it too complicated.

2659
01:53:23,080 --> 01:53:25,840
I made it too...

2660
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:26,580
I don't know.

2661
01:53:26,620 --> 01:53:28,080
I thought we were playing with angles.

2662
01:53:28,580 --> 01:53:30,700
I thought we were playing with angles.

2663
01:53:31,420 --> 01:53:36,160
I thought we were trying to be fucking smart here.

2664
01:53:36,440 --> 01:53:38,900
I didn't realize it was a simple solution.

2665
01:53:43,660 --> 01:53:44,360
All right.

2666
01:53:44,360 --> 01:53:44,960
Let's see.

2667
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:46,980
Let's do it here.

2668
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:48,840
Oh!

2669
01:53:49,020 --> 01:53:49,400
Oh!

2670
01:53:49,420 --> 01:53:49,760
It's the...

2671
01:53:49,780 --> 01:53:50,040
Oh!

2672
01:53:51,940 --> 01:53:53,040
That's fucking right.

2673
01:53:53,300 --> 01:53:55,920
You can't give me nightmares if I don't believe in them.

2674
01:53:56,180 --> 01:53:56,960
Oh shit.

2675
01:53:57,100 --> 01:53:57,520
Wait.

2676
01:53:57,600 --> 01:53:58,240
Is that the...

2677
01:53:59,800 --> 01:54:00,280
Oh!

2678
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:01,260
Those are the wizards.

2679
01:54:02,140 --> 01:54:02,620
Oh!

2680
01:54:02,640 --> 01:54:03,180
What am I doing?

2681
01:54:03,340 --> 01:54:04,180
What did I do?

2682
01:54:04,340 --> 01:54:05,400
I can't tell!

2683
01:54:05,420 --> 01:54:06,120
I can't see!

2684
01:54:07,180 --> 01:54:08,360
I can't see!

2685
01:54:08,840 --> 01:54:10,400
I don't know what I did!

2686
01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:12,900
All right.

2687
01:54:12,900 --> 01:54:13,200
Nice.

2688
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:16,480
Oh!

2689
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:17,000
Oh!

2690
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:17,360
There's more.

2691
01:54:17,680 --> 01:54:18,160
Oh!

2692
01:54:18,360 --> 01:54:19,280
Can't catch me?

2693
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:19,600
Oh!

2694
01:54:19,680 --> 01:54:19,760
Oh!

2695
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:20,160
Never mind.

2696
01:54:20,220 --> 01:54:20,620
He caught me.

2697
01:54:21,080 --> 01:54:22,400
He fucking caught me.

2698
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:23,840
Oh shit!

2699
01:54:24,840 --> 01:54:25,320
Okay.

2700
01:54:25,380 --> 01:54:25,580
It's fine.

2701
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:27,840
Oh!

2702
01:54:27,860 --> 01:54:28,460
It's not fine!

2703
01:54:29,080 --> 01:54:29,460
Wait.

2704
01:54:29,540 --> 01:54:30,240
It's not fine!

2705
01:54:32,860 --> 01:54:34,960
Little do I know, it was not fine.

2706
01:54:35,220 --> 01:54:35,760
It's okay.

2707
01:54:36,040 --> 01:54:36,520
Heals.

2708
01:54:36,980 --> 01:54:37,460
Heals.

2709
01:54:37,600 --> 01:54:38,300
We got the heals.

2710
01:54:40,260 --> 01:54:40,840
All right.

2711
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:42,400
Oh!

2712
01:54:42,460 --> 01:54:43,120
New update.

2713
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:46,180
They're much easier to kill when grounded.

2714
01:54:46,220 --> 01:54:48,020
Tripping them up seems to work pretty well.

2715
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:52,660
Okay I need some vases to break.

2716
01:54:55,540 --> 01:54:55,860
Okay.

2717
01:54:55,940 --> 01:54:57,340
So, there is a plant!

2718
01:55:00,820 --> 01:55:06,480
I'm masterfully done checking every other angle besides the correct one.

2719
01:55:07,400 --> 01:55:08,960
Thank you for the super chat!

2720
01:55:09,100 --> 01:55:09,560
Zia!

2721
01:55:09,640 --> 01:55:10,160
Thank you!

2722
01:55:10,460 --> 01:55:15,400
I was just showing you guys what not to do, chat.

2723
01:55:15,800 --> 01:55:16,140
Okay?

2724
01:55:16,820 --> 01:55:19,560
This is a walk-through.

2725
01:55:19,720 --> 01:55:19,980
Okay?

2726
01:55:19,980 --> 01:55:28,240
I'm making sure you guys know what were the incorrect angles to look at, so you don't waste your time.

2727
01:55:28,460 --> 01:55:30,980
I am so... I'm so...

2728
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:36,440
Oh my god, I am like so kind and humble.

2729
01:55:36,540 --> 01:55:45,240
I am giving up my own time to show you guys the wrong ways of getting these enchanted plants.

2730
01:55:47,780 --> 01:55:52,320
I'm giving up my own free time just for this, guys.

2731
01:55:53,480 --> 01:55:55,960
Yeah, I'm so considerate, chat.

2732
01:55:56,280 --> 01:55:57,820
How the fuck do I open you?

2733
01:55:59,940 --> 01:56:03,360
Where's the... where's the... where are the plants?

2734
01:56:06,640 --> 01:56:08,280
Where the fuck are the plants?

2735
01:56:10,060 --> 01:56:10,660
Oh.

2736
01:56:10,660 --> 01:56:11,460
Boy, read!

2737
01:56:16,900 --> 01:56:17,820
Keep safe the line.

2738
01:56:18,760 --> 01:56:20,000
Didn't do a very good job.

2739
01:56:20,500 --> 01:56:20,980
Oh.

2740
01:56:23,240 --> 01:56:24,700
Where the fuck are the plants?

2741
01:56:27,640 --> 01:56:28,440
Boy, look.

2742
01:56:28,980 --> 01:56:30,460
Where the plants at, boy?

2743
01:56:31,940 --> 01:56:33,220
Where is the plants?

2744
01:56:33,400 --> 01:56:34,540
Is the plants here?

2745
01:56:38,420 --> 01:56:39,460
The plants here?

2746
01:56:42,340 --> 01:56:42,820
Okay.

2747
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:43,560
Up?

2748
01:56:43,660 --> 01:56:44,100
Okay.

2749
01:56:44,320 --> 01:56:45,380
I'm gonna go up then.

2750
01:56:46,820 --> 01:56:47,800
Oh, it's over here!

2751
01:56:49,600 --> 01:56:50,300
Nice.

2752
01:56:50,710 --> 01:56:51,060
Oh.

2753
01:56:52,740 --> 01:56:53,440
Oh?

2754
01:56:55,180 --> 01:56:56,280
There's more?

2755
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:00,400
Where are the other plants?

2756
01:57:02,620 --> 01:57:03,320
Huh?

2757
01:57:05,080 --> 01:57:06,120
Oh, here!

2758
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:07,900
Okay.

2759
01:57:10,650 --> 01:57:11,720
There's more than two?

2760
01:57:13,240 --> 01:57:15,060
Where the third plant go?

2761
01:57:17,660 --> 01:57:21,790
Where the fuck is the third one?

2762
01:57:26,920 --> 01:57:28,100
I only see two.

2763
01:57:31,640 --> 01:57:32,160
Oh.

2764
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:34,880
Wherever it was.

2765
01:57:37,740 --> 01:57:39,040
I got it.

2766
01:57:39,600 --> 01:57:40,400
First try.

2767
01:57:40,760 --> 01:57:43,860
I don't know where that third plant was, but I did it.

2768
01:57:44,520 --> 01:57:45,880
It was there somewhere.

2769
01:57:46,460 --> 01:57:47,660
It was... it was there.

2770
01:57:49,900 --> 01:57:50,620
All right.

2771
01:57:50,920 --> 01:57:51,600
Oh, nice.

2772
01:57:52,040 --> 01:57:52,560
Bitch.

2773
01:57:52,580 --> 01:57:52,600
Okay.

2774
01:57:52,600 --> 01:57:53,100
Let's go.

2775
01:57:53,300 --> 01:57:53,480
Oh, she's a badass.

2776
01:57:53,480 --> 01:57:54,680
Favouring.

2777
01:57:54,680 --> 01:57:55,660
There we go.

2778
01:57:57,420 --> 01:57:58,060
It's the possibility of the monster.

2779
01:57:58,140 --> 01:57:59,040
I got it.

2780
01:58:00,760 --> 01:58:01,720
I got it.

2781
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:01,880
Bitch.

2782
01:58:02,060 --> 01:58:02,700
Macho.

2783
01:58:06,380 --> 01:58:07,020
Macho!

2784
01:58:08,420 --> 01:58:09,060
Macho.

2785
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:11,920
Macho.

2786
01:58:14,940 --> 01:58:15,580
Macho.

2787
01:58:22,280 --> 01:58:22,920
Macho.

2788
01:58:22,920 --> 01:58:23,900
The elves are not winning the war.

2789
01:58:24,140 --> 01:58:25,160
I don't know why.

2790
01:58:29,740 --> 01:58:31,020
I don't know.

2791
01:58:31,800 --> 01:58:39,380
It's just a feeling I have that they might not be winning this light vs dark elves war.

2792
01:58:45,630 --> 01:58:48,170
What are they doing?

2793
01:58:48,870 --> 01:58:50,110
Where are they running to?

2794
01:58:51,290 --> 01:58:52,190
Is he okay?

2795
01:58:52,190 --> 01:58:54,970
Do you think that light elf is gonna live?

2796
01:58:56,710 --> 01:58:57,570
Oh yeah!

2797
01:58:57,730 --> 01:58:58,630
What is he doing?

2798
01:59:00,910 --> 01:59:01,230
What?

2799
01:59:07,950 --> 01:59:09,230
Oh shit!

2800
01:59:13,950 --> 01:59:15,310
Why didn't he defend himself?

2801
01:59:17,210 --> 01:59:18,770
Is he dumb?

2802
01:59:22,710 --> 01:59:23,870
Oh shit!

2803
01:59:23,910 --> 01:59:25,110
Why didn't he fight back?

2804
01:59:25,430 --> 01:59:26,630
Is he stupid?

2805
01:59:30,090 --> 01:59:31,110
He's still alive!

2806
01:59:31,210 --> 01:59:31,850
He's still moving!

2807
01:59:34,110 --> 01:59:35,050
Holy shit!

2808
01:59:35,070 --> 01:59:35,910
He doesn't die!

2809
01:59:36,770 --> 01:59:38,610
Wait, they're still going at it!

2810
01:59:40,470 --> 01:59:44,270
I mean, he's still... How much HP does this guy have?

2811
01:59:45,330 --> 01:59:46,230
I don't...

2812
01:59:46,230 --> 01:59:47,370
I don't...

2813
01:59:47,370 --> 01:59:47,590
I don't...

2814
01:59:47,590 --> 01:59:47,810
I don't...

2815
01:59:49,330 --> 01:59:50,530
I don't...

2816
01:59:52,290 --> 01:59:54,590
Guys, I think... Bro!

2817
01:59:54,910 --> 01:59:55,930
What's his HP?

2818
01:59:56,050 --> 01:59:57,310
Like a million HP?

2819
01:59:57,510 --> 01:59:59,430
How the fuck did they lose this war?

2820
02:00:03,190 --> 02:00:04,310
Nope, he's still alive.

2821
02:00:05,890 --> 02:00:07,090
He's still struggling.

2822
02:00:10,430 --> 02:00:10,990
Alright.

2823
02:00:11,270 --> 02:00:12,270
Is he still alive?

2824
02:00:14,030 --> 02:00:14,790
No, yep!

2825
02:00:15,410 --> 02:00:16,750
Oh, okay, he's...

2826
02:00:16,750 --> 02:00:17,190
Oh!

2827
02:00:17,670 --> 02:00:18,130
Woah!

2828
02:00:18,350 --> 02:00:20,130
He flung him all the way over there!

2829
02:00:21,170 --> 02:00:22,130
Holy shit!

2830
02:00:23,970 --> 02:00:24,450
Damn!

2831
02:00:24,790 --> 02:00:26,630
He actually flung him all the...

2832
02:00:26,630 --> 02:00:30,210
Oh my god, they flung his fucking dead body all the way over there too!

2833
02:00:30,410 --> 02:00:31,070
That's fucked!

2834
02:00:31,670 --> 02:00:32,990
That's actually fucked!

2835
02:00:34,710 --> 02:00:35,530
Oh shit!

2836
02:00:35,910 --> 02:00:36,390
Alright.

2837
02:00:37,950 --> 02:00:39,370
Alright, don't worry, I got you.

2838
02:00:39,850 --> 02:00:40,330
Oh!

2839
02:00:40,430 --> 02:00:40,910
There's...

2840
02:00:41,610 --> 02:00:42,350
There's a reinforcements!

2841
02:00:42,790 --> 02:00:43,030
No!

2842
02:00:43,130 --> 02:00:43,710
Not this guy!

2843
02:00:44,250 --> 02:00:44,730
No!

2844
02:00:44,830 --> 02:00:45,550
Wrong guy!

2845
02:00:45,590 --> 02:00:46,090
Wrong guy!

2846
02:00:46,090 --> 02:00:46,550
Wrong guy!

2847
02:00:46,670 --> 02:00:48,010
We need to get the reinforcements guy!

2848
02:00:48,290 --> 02:00:48,770
Oh!

2849
02:00:50,130 --> 02:00:50,310
Okay.

2850
02:00:51,270 --> 02:00:51,990
Don't worry.

2851
02:00:53,230 --> 02:00:53,750
Oh!

2852
02:00:53,750 --> 02:00:54,270
Worry!

2853
02:00:55,170 --> 02:00:55,690
Worry!

2854
02:00:55,990 --> 02:00:57,390
I've tried so hard!

2855
02:00:57,450 --> 02:00:57,710
No!

2856
02:00:57,810 --> 02:00:58,770
I can't see!

2857
02:00:59,770 --> 02:01:00,970
There's so many!

2858
02:01:01,750 --> 02:01:02,270
Okay.

2859
02:01:02,530 --> 02:01:03,490
Don't worry, we're fine.

2860
02:01:03,610 --> 02:01:03,910
We're fine.

2861
02:01:04,050 --> 02:01:04,950
Everything is fine.

2862
02:01:05,790 --> 02:01:07,390
Everything is so fine.

2863
02:01:08,350 --> 02:01:09,330
Oh god!

2864
02:01:09,810 --> 02:01:11,730
Everything is still so fine!

2865
02:01:14,070 --> 02:01:14,590
No!

2866
02:01:14,590 --> 02:01:14,750
No!

2867
02:01:14,790 --> 02:01:14,910
No!

2868
02:01:14,970 --> 02:01:15,070
No!

2869
02:01:15,070 --> 02:01:15,190
No!

2870
02:01:15,190 --> 02:01:15,290
No!

2871
02:01:15,290 --> 02:01:15,370
No!

2872
02:01:15,370 --> 02:01:15,470
No!

2873
02:01:15,470 --> 02:01:15,570
No!

2874
02:01:15,570 --> 02:01:16,230
Get down!

2875
02:01:16,470 --> 02:01:16,930
Get down!

2876
02:01:16,930 --> 02:01:17,270
Get down!

2877
02:01:17,750 --> 02:01:19,190
Get down, Mr. President!

2878
02:01:20,130 --> 02:01:20,810
Get down!

2879
02:01:20,810 --> 02:01:21,130
Get down, Mr. President!

2880
02:01:22,110 --> 02:01:22,870
We're okay.

2881
02:01:23,150 --> 02:01:24,310
See I told you guys!

2882
02:01:24,390 --> 02:01:25,650
Everything is still fine.

2883
02:01:26,250 --> 02:01:27,450
Look for a way inside.

2884
02:01:28,730 --> 02:01:29,410
Oh, hey!

2885
02:01:30,930 --> 02:01:32,370
That elf body is gone.

2886
02:01:33,830 --> 02:01:37,230
I think my favorite part was when they flung that body all the way here.

2887
02:01:38,230 --> 02:01:40,570
After I finally got there.

2888
02:01:41,450 --> 02:01:44,750
They're like, why won't you fucking die?!

2889
02:01:46,390 --> 02:01:46,910
Alright.

2890
02:01:46,910 --> 02:01:47,290
Alright.

2891
02:01:49,830 --> 02:01:52,770
Time to destroy the environment.

2892
02:01:54,830 --> 02:01:55,350
Nice.

2893
02:01:57,070 --> 02:01:58,810
Maybe I should upgrade the boy.

2894
02:02:01,310 --> 02:02:01,830
Nah.

2895
02:02:05,110 --> 02:02:07,470
If I upgrade him, how will he learn?

2896
02:02:08,850 --> 02:02:11,010
I'm not giving no hands up to my boy.

2897
02:02:11,630 --> 02:02:13,610
He's gotta learn just like how I did.

2898
02:02:15,650 --> 02:02:16,670
Let's see.

2899
02:02:16,770 --> 02:02:17,310
This way.

2900
02:02:20,790 --> 02:02:21,970
Oh, where?

2901
02:02:22,210 --> 02:02:22,810
Oh, there.

2902
02:02:24,710 --> 02:02:25,490
Goodbye.

2903
02:02:27,050 --> 02:02:27,830
Goodbye.

2904
02:02:30,210 --> 02:02:31,930
That was easy.

2905
02:02:34,810 --> 02:02:35,590
Alright.

2906
02:02:36,090 --> 02:02:37,310
Oh, whoops.

2907
02:02:40,130 --> 02:02:40,910
Easy.

2908
02:02:44,030 --> 02:02:44,870
What the fuck?

2909
02:02:44,910 --> 02:02:45,710
He didn't even do anything!

2910
02:02:49,810 --> 02:02:51,990
The boy literally just watched.

2911
02:02:53,670 --> 02:02:54,870
I missed the door.

2912
02:02:55,950 --> 02:02:56,950
Oh shit, wait.

2913
02:02:57,550 --> 02:02:59,590
Wait, is that the reinforcement guy again?

2914
02:03:00,930 --> 02:03:03,810
Oh god, I gotta kill him before he gets reinforcements again.

2915
02:03:04,010 --> 02:03:04,810
Oh shit!

2916
02:03:05,050 --> 02:03:05,990
Oh, I fucked up!

2917
02:03:08,250 --> 02:03:10,430
I keep forgetting not to...

2918
02:03:11,150 --> 02:03:13,010
I keep wanting to hit explosions.

2919
02:03:13,010 --> 02:03:14,070
I can't help it.

2920
02:03:16,430 --> 02:03:17,530
It's okay, I'm angry.

2921
02:03:17,670 --> 02:03:18,610
I have anger issue.

2922
02:03:18,810 --> 02:03:20,990
And the wife told me to get therapy.

2923
02:03:21,370 --> 02:03:23,450
I knew therapy doesn't work.

2924
02:03:24,130 --> 02:03:25,590
Guys, that was a joke, guys.

2925
02:03:25,730 --> 02:03:26,510
Wait, I died?

2926
02:03:26,850 --> 02:03:27,270
No!

2927
02:03:31,220 --> 02:03:33,920
Okay, maybe I should go get anger management.

2928
02:03:35,080 --> 02:03:37,500
Maybe the wife was right, boy.

2929
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:38,920
Wait, did I win?

2930
02:03:39,980 --> 02:03:41,000
Wait, where am I?

2931
02:03:44,200 --> 02:03:46,040
Maybe... maybe the wife was right.

2932
02:03:48,560 --> 02:03:49,040
Oh.

2933
02:03:50,220 --> 02:03:52,080
Wait, oh, I have to do this again.

2934
02:03:52,200 --> 02:03:53,080
God damn it!

2935
02:03:53,360 --> 02:03:53,980
It's alright.

2936
02:03:54,960 --> 02:03:57,980
I like destroying this... I like destroying Elf World.

2937
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:03,480
Okay.

2938
02:04:04,180 --> 02:04:05,380
Back out of we go.

2939
02:04:09,120 --> 02:04:09,600
Wait!

2940
02:04:12,200 --> 02:04:13,020
No, okay.

2941
02:04:13,200 --> 02:04:14,200
Okay, I thought like...

2942
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:15,780
I thought... wait.

2943
02:04:18,100 --> 02:04:18,880
Is this new?

2944
02:04:19,580 --> 02:04:20,480
Wait, this is new.

2945
02:04:20,740 --> 02:04:21,180
Wait.

2946
02:04:22,760 --> 02:04:23,200
Wait.

2947
02:04:24,080 --> 02:04:24,980
I made it.

2948
02:04:26,260 --> 02:04:28,160
I was like, I don't remember going up.

2949
02:04:29,020 --> 02:04:29,460
Oh!

2950
02:04:31,140 --> 02:04:32,620
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

2951
02:04:32,780 --> 02:04:33,720
I fucking knew it.

2952
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:35,500
The wife was wrong, that's why she's dead.

2953
02:04:37,300 --> 02:04:38,280
I've never been here.

2954
02:04:39,140 --> 02:04:40,160
It still worked.

2955
02:04:40,580 --> 02:04:41,740
The wife was wrong.

2956
02:04:42,140 --> 02:04:44,200
This is why she died and I lived.

2957
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:46,960
See, I wanna know...

2958
02:04:46,960 --> 02:04:48,140
Okay, I do have to angle it.

2959
02:04:48,500 --> 02:04:48,940
Alright.

2960
02:04:54,150 --> 02:04:55,930
What's the right angle?

2961
02:04:58,910 --> 02:04:59,710
Did I do it?

2962
02:05:00,290 --> 02:05:00,730
Oh.

2963
02:05:03,690 --> 02:05:04,130
Alright.

2964
02:05:05,150 --> 02:05:05,810
Okay, nope.

2965
02:05:06,330 --> 02:05:07,550
I think it's right here.

2966
02:05:08,790 --> 02:05:09,390
Is it?

2967
02:05:09,830 --> 02:05:10,270
Yeah.

2968
02:05:10,770 --> 02:05:12,810
Alright, and then... this angle.

2969
02:05:14,010 --> 02:05:14,990
All I'm saying...

2970
02:05:15,430 --> 02:05:16,890
I died, but yet I survived.

2971
02:05:16,890 --> 02:05:17,850
I still got the checkpoint.

2972
02:05:20,210 --> 02:05:20,690
Nice.

2973
02:05:23,550 --> 02:05:24,030
Alright.

2974
02:05:24,610 --> 02:05:25,090
Uh...

2975
02:05:25,090 --> 02:05:26,330
I think that's everything.

2976
02:05:26,790 --> 02:05:27,910
Is this everything, boy?

2977
02:05:28,770 --> 02:05:29,250
Yeah.

2978
02:05:29,330 --> 02:05:29,810
Oh, shit!

2979
02:05:29,850 --> 02:05:30,150
Face!

2980
02:05:34,570 --> 02:05:36,470
I died, but I still won.

2981
02:05:36,610 --> 02:05:37,050
Exactly.

2982
02:05:38,830 --> 02:05:40,310
What the fuck is that?

2983
02:05:41,310 --> 02:05:43,110
How did they die between the walls?

2984
02:05:43,230 --> 02:05:43,830
Wait, what?

2985
02:05:45,470 --> 02:05:47,250
How did they die between the walls?

2986
02:05:47,650 --> 02:05:49,190
Who the fuck killed you guys there?

2987
02:05:54,850 --> 02:05:55,290
Hello?

2988
02:05:56,370 --> 02:05:57,110
Did you hear that?

2989
02:05:57,270 --> 02:05:59,070
Oh, they're like wasps.

2990
02:05:59,230 --> 02:06:01,690
Oh, the light elves are like bees!

2991
02:06:01,910 --> 02:06:04,870
And then the dark elves are like wasps.

2992
02:06:05,010 --> 02:06:06,890
How do you think we get it into the Bifrost?

2993
02:06:07,050 --> 02:06:08,310
The witch said to step into it.

2994
02:06:08,670 --> 02:06:09,190
She did?

2995
02:06:09,650 --> 02:06:11,510
When she was ripped away from this realm.

2996
02:06:11,890 --> 02:06:13,830
Yeah, this is like a wasp nest.

2997
02:06:14,230 --> 02:06:15,790
That's what it reminds me of.

2998
02:06:17,870 --> 02:06:18,310
Oh!

2999
02:06:21,110 --> 02:06:22,330
They're in my wasp.

3000
02:06:22,330 --> 02:06:22,550
Oh!

3001
02:06:22,570 --> 02:06:23,190
Why?

3002
02:06:27,130 --> 02:06:28,650
Wait, it's that easy?

3003
02:06:30,550 --> 02:06:32,810
I just need to stab them in the head?

3004
02:06:33,210 --> 02:06:34,270
The fuck am I...

3005
02:06:34,270 --> 02:06:36,270
Why did I make it harder for myself?

3006
02:06:36,590 --> 02:06:39,010
Why am I stabbing them everywhere but the head?

3007
02:06:39,650 --> 02:06:40,430
God damn.

3008
02:06:40,630 --> 02:06:41,470
I just want to fight.

3009
02:06:43,830 --> 02:06:45,030
Good job, boy.

3010
02:06:48,230 --> 02:06:49,270
All right.

3011
02:06:49,370 --> 02:06:49,990
This way.

3012
02:06:52,030 --> 02:06:52,550
Oh, shit.

3013
02:06:52,550 --> 02:06:54,330
I guess the walls are made of Al's.

3014
02:06:58,010 --> 02:06:58,530
Hello?

3015
02:07:00,030 --> 02:07:01,310
Where's the wasp queen?

3016
02:07:02,010 --> 02:07:02,950
Another one!

3017
02:07:03,190 --> 02:07:03,870
Stay back.

3018
02:07:04,130 --> 02:07:04,650
Oh!

3019
02:07:05,290 --> 02:07:06,330
Stab him in the head!

3020
02:07:08,710 --> 02:07:10,430
All right, let me not do that.

3021
02:07:10,650 --> 02:07:11,390
Let me...

3022
02:07:13,410 --> 02:07:15,310
I could let go right now.

3023
02:07:21,320 --> 02:07:22,820
Yes, we are near our goal.

3024
02:07:23,080 --> 02:07:24,320
And we must be careful.

3025
02:07:24,620 --> 02:07:25,140
Understand?

3026
02:07:25,180 --> 02:07:25,460
No.

3027
02:07:25,460 --> 02:07:25,920
Why do we need to come out of this place?

3028
02:07:25,940 --> 02:07:26,280
Did he just let him live?

3029
02:07:26,460 --> 02:07:27,160
Oh wait, what?

3030
02:07:31,080 --> 02:07:33,320
Did he just like, alright, bye.

3031
02:07:34,480 --> 02:07:35,880
What if I just...

3032
02:07:37,600 --> 02:07:38,820
What if I...

3033
02:07:41,240 --> 02:07:42,940
Oh, the game won't let me throw up.

3034
02:07:44,080 --> 02:07:46,200
The game knows.

3035
02:07:47,680 --> 02:07:50,860
Like, what if I just throw my axe into the air.

3036
02:07:54,280 --> 02:07:56,640
But like, what if guys...

3037
02:08:00,180 --> 02:08:05,640
What if I want to throw my axe into the pile of airs?

3038
02:08:07,400 --> 02:08:08,920
Intrusive thought denied.

3039
02:08:09,520 --> 02:08:12,220
I can't believe they Doki-proofed it.

3040
02:08:21,690 --> 02:08:23,330
Oh shit.

3041
02:08:23,510 --> 02:08:24,550
Watch this.

3042
02:08:25,270 --> 02:08:26,850
Oh, not that.

3043
02:08:29,230 --> 02:08:30,030
Okay, now...

3044
02:08:30,030 --> 02:08:31,570
Okay, everything's fine now.

3045
02:08:32,770 --> 02:08:33,870
Now watch this.

3046
02:08:34,170 --> 02:08:34,930
Oh shit!

3047
02:08:35,830 --> 02:08:36,730
It's okay, we're fine.

3048
02:08:38,070 --> 02:08:39,010
Wait, where's my axe?

3049
02:08:39,270 --> 02:08:41,250
Wait, when did I fucking throw my axe away?

3050
02:08:42,930 --> 02:08:44,610
If I just run straight, wait.

3051
02:08:44,770 --> 02:08:46,070
I don't have to kill them, right?

3052
02:08:46,910 --> 02:08:48,050
I just need to run straight.

3053
02:08:48,230 --> 02:08:48,770
Okay, goodbye.

3054
02:08:50,150 --> 02:08:50,950
Oh shit!

3055
02:08:51,110 --> 02:08:52,090
Nevermind, there's too many!

3056
02:08:52,470 --> 02:08:53,550
Oh, there's too many!

3057
02:08:53,790 --> 02:08:54,770
Okay, but what if?

3058
02:08:55,810 --> 02:08:56,210
Goodbye.

3059
02:08:57,330 --> 02:08:57,630
Goodbye.

3060
02:08:59,630 --> 02:09:01,170
Please let me through!

3061
02:09:01,530 --> 02:09:02,430
Let me through!

3062
02:09:03,550 --> 02:09:04,710
Let me through!

3063
02:09:04,830 --> 02:09:05,630
I just wanna know!

3064
02:09:06,190 --> 02:09:07,670
I just wanna know!

3065
02:09:10,270 --> 02:09:11,210
Let me through!

3066
02:09:12,190 --> 02:09:12,970
Fuck you!

3067
02:09:13,790 --> 02:09:14,890
Oh my god.

3068
02:09:15,010 --> 02:09:16,550
Guys, I think I should have killed him.

3069
02:09:17,870 --> 02:09:18,430
Alright.

3070
02:09:18,870 --> 02:09:22,130
If I can't run through them, I will fight them!

3071
02:09:24,690 --> 02:09:25,610
That's fucking...

3072
02:09:25,610 --> 02:09:26,290
Oh, I get XP!

3073
02:09:26,510 --> 02:09:26,870
Nevermind.

3074
02:09:27,330 --> 02:09:27,590
I will fight them.

3075
02:09:27,770 --> 02:09:28,870
I actually get XP.

3076
02:09:31,650 --> 02:09:32,930
It's okay, everything is fine.

3077
02:09:36,890 --> 02:09:37,330
Alright.

3078
02:09:37,890 --> 02:09:38,470
We're fine!

3079
02:09:38,530 --> 02:09:39,150
They're like grunts!

3080
02:09:39,350 --> 02:09:40,710
They were not meant to fight!

3081
02:09:42,230 --> 02:09:43,770
They were not meant to fight!

3082
02:09:44,830 --> 02:09:45,270
Alright.

3083
02:09:45,490 --> 02:09:46,590
Oh, he was right there.

3084
02:09:47,310 --> 02:09:48,650
He was literally right there.

3085
02:09:52,950 --> 02:09:55,270
I thought I could cheese it and just ran through it.

3086
02:09:58,470 --> 02:09:59,830
This is your time!

3087
02:09:59,990 --> 02:10:05,510
I just wanna be cheeky!

3088
02:10:05,590 --> 02:10:07,170
I wanna fucking run through!

3089
02:10:13,310 --> 02:10:14,810
They're like little babies.

3090
02:10:14,870 --> 02:10:16,530
They haven't grown to be adults yet.

3091
02:10:18,370 --> 02:10:19,230
Touch the light!

3092
02:10:19,410 --> 02:10:20,050
Touch it!

3093
02:10:21,850 --> 02:10:23,130
What if I push him in?

3094
02:10:28,410 --> 02:10:29,750
Oh, I destroyed the whole hive!

3095
02:10:29,750 --> 02:10:32,130
It's making the whole temple reappear!

3096
02:10:32,510 --> 02:10:33,970
It's the source of all of it!

3097
02:10:34,290 --> 02:10:35,910
Hold towards the light, boy!

3098
02:10:38,490 --> 02:10:38,970
Wait!

3099
02:10:39,650 --> 02:10:40,130
It's...

3100
02:10:40,810 --> 02:10:41,550
It's singing!

3101
02:10:42,550 --> 02:10:43,410
Come on, boy!

3102
02:10:44,270 --> 02:10:45,250
I hear her!

3103
02:10:45,410 --> 02:10:46,730
I told you I heard her!

3104
02:10:46,870 --> 02:10:48,030
Do you think she's in there?

3105
02:10:48,230 --> 02:10:50,870
Oh, shit!

3106
02:10:51,790 --> 02:10:52,750
Fucking idiot!

3107
02:10:55,870 --> 02:10:58,350
This is why you don't touch the light!

3108
02:10:58,350 --> 02:10:58,790
Hahaha!

3109
02:11:04,970 --> 02:11:06,730
Are you stupid?

3110
02:11:10,770 --> 02:11:14,850
It's like those types of dads that make you do the wrong thing to teach you a lesson.

3111
02:11:29,220 --> 02:11:31,340
Oh, I'm going towards the light?

3112
02:11:33,180 --> 02:11:33,780
Oh!

3113
02:11:34,420 --> 02:11:34,980
Owie!

3114
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,120
If I punch the light hard enough...

3115
02:11:45,120 --> 02:11:45,880
Hahaha!

3116
02:11:46,200 --> 02:11:47,500
It can't hurt me!

3117
02:11:48,780 --> 02:11:49,520
Oh, wait!

3118
02:11:49,920 --> 02:11:50,480
Oh!

3119
02:11:50,600 --> 02:11:55,660
I told you!

3120
02:11:56,720 --> 02:11:57,280
Hahaha!

3121
02:11:59,040 --> 02:12:00,680
I fucking knew it!

3122
02:12:02,940 --> 02:12:05,460
It can't hurt me if I punch the light!

3123
02:12:09,100 --> 02:12:10,440
I'm gonna fist the light.

3124
02:12:14,480 --> 02:12:15,920
Oh, is that my dead wife?

3125
02:12:18,660 --> 02:12:19,180
Hello?

3126
02:12:19,480 --> 02:12:20,360
You have to come back.

3127
02:12:21,380 --> 02:12:22,640
You left me here alone.

3128
02:12:23,420 --> 02:12:23,940
Atreus?

3129
02:12:24,320 --> 02:12:24,840
Atreus?

3130
02:12:25,240 --> 02:12:25,460
Who?

3131
02:12:30,820 --> 02:12:31,840
Oh, I should follow...

3132
02:12:31,840 --> 02:12:33,240
What if I don't follow the light?

3133
02:12:34,180 --> 02:12:35,100
What happens?

3134
02:12:35,900 --> 02:12:37,620
What if there's loot in the light?

3135
02:12:38,120 --> 02:12:39,140
He's never here.

3136
02:12:39,340 --> 02:12:40,380
He always...

3137
02:12:40,380 --> 02:12:43,640
As I walk away from...

3138
02:12:43,640 --> 02:12:44,760
I don't...

3139
02:12:45,800 --> 02:12:46,140
I don't understand.

3140
02:12:46,340 --> 02:12:47,920
There might be loot in the light world.

3141
02:12:48,100 --> 02:12:49,500
It could be loot.

3142
02:12:51,360 --> 02:12:51,880
Alright.

3143
02:12:51,980 --> 02:12:53,480
Fine, fine.

3144
02:12:53,580 --> 02:12:54,720
I'll follow the light.

3145
02:12:55,840 --> 02:12:58,320
The solution to all problems.

3146
02:12:58,520 --> 02:12:59,240
Hit it harder.

3147
02:12:59,700 --> 02:13:01,340
Thank you for the super chat.

3148
02:13:01,420 --> 02:13:02,700
Thank you, thank you.

3149
02:13:03,620 --> 02:13:04,680
You don't know that?

3150
02:13:04,900 --> 02:13:05,440
Oh, my God.

3151
02:13:05,460 --> 02:13:06,400
There's a fucking crow.

3152
02:13:06,780 --> 02:13:07,780
God damn it!

3153
02:13:07,780 --> 02:13:09,860
I knew I should have given Atreus my...

3154
02:13:09,860 --> 02:13:10,660
axe.

3155
02:13:11,380 --> 02:13:14,000
The government spies are watching me again.

3156
02:13:15,620 --> 02:13:16,140
Alright.

3157
02:13:16,360 --> 02:13:17,240
Off I go.

3158
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:19,820
Wait, there's so many government spies.

3159
02:13:20,220 --> 02:13:22,080
This is where our taxes are going to?

3160
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:25,220
As a god, do I have to pay taxes?

3161
02:13:28,180 --> 02:13:28,700
Alright.

3162
02:13:28,700 --> 02:13:29,460
Knock, knock.

3163
02:13:33,360 --> 02:13:35,800
Oh, that's him talking to my wife.

3164
02:13:37,980 --> 02:13:39,380
I'm not what he thinks I am.

3165
02:13:39,640 --> 02:13:40,900
I know better.

3166
02:13:41,160 --> 02:13:46,590
Oh, that's Thor?

3167
02:13:46,890 --> 02:13:47,690
He doesn't talk to me.

3168
02:13:48,030 --> 02:13:49,390
He doesn't teach me.

3169
02:13:49,450 --> 02:13:51,890
Jesus Christ, stop trauma dumping, aren't you?

3170
02:13:52,290 --> 02:13:53,770
Him, not you.

3171
02:13:56,900 --> 02:13:58,700
Those are his inner thoughts.

3172
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:03,760
Oh, my God, you piece of shit son.

3173
02:14:07,160 --> 02:14:10,360
Now I know how you really feel about me.

3174
02:14:13,620 --> 02:14:15,600
Fucking knew I should have pushed him into the light.

3175
02:14:15,700 --> 02:14:16,680
I fucking knew it.

3176
02:14:20,480 --> 02:14:23,120
Now I know everything, boy.

3177
02:14:27,180 --> 02:14:27,660
Alright.

3178
02:14:27,760 --> 02:14:28,600
Oh, what's this?

3179
02:14:28,860 --> 02:14:30,160
Oh, those are dead fish.

3180
02:14:31,020 --> 02:14:33,820
Am I like in Atreus' mind or something?

3181
02:14:36,140 --> 02:14:36,620
Alright.

3182
02:14:36,740 --> 02:14:37,560
Off we go.

3183
02:14:38,820 --> 02:14:40,480
Boy, when I get out of the light.

3184
02:14:41,860 --> 02:14:42,740
Oh, beat your ass.

3185
02:14:46,380 --> 02:14:47,860
I just wish he was better.

3186
02:14:48,560 --> 02:14:49,080
Damn!

3187
02:14:50,220 --> 02:14:51,020
I know he can be again.

3188
02:14:52,240 --> 02:14:53,720
I'll never change.

3189
02:14:53,960 --> 02:14:56,200
You wanna know what happened to my first child?

3190
02:14:57,040 --> 02:14:57,500
I'll try.

3191
02:14:58,880 --> 02:15:02,240
But if he doesn't, please come back.

3192
02:15:02,940 --> 02:15:04,520
I know you're out there somewhere.

3193
02:15:07,800 --> 02:15:08,320
Bitch.

3194
02:15:13,600 --> 02:15:15,300
Gods don't change.

3195
02:15:15,900 --> 02:15:17,360
We're too powerful.

3196
02:15:21,240 --> 02:15:21,960
Alright.

3197
02:15:22,100 --> 02:15:22,900
Up we go.

3198
02:15:30,630 --> 02:15:35,770
I'm literally god of war, not fucking god of fathers.

3199
02:15:37,910 --> 02:15:39,150
Wait, that's Faye.

3200
02:15:39,690 --> 02:15:40,990
What have you done?

3201
02:15:40,990 --> 02:15:42,630
Why did you do that?

3202
02:15:42,950 --> 02:15:44,110
I saved you.

3203
02:15:44,210 --> 02:15:45,350
You were trapped in there.

3204
02:15:45,450 --> 02:15:47,930
I waited and I waited but you wouldn't come out.

3205
02:15:47,950 --> 02:15:49,910
It was five minutes, Atreus.

3206
02:15:50,830 --> 02:15:52,270
I was gone only.

3207
02:15:53,290 --> 02:15:54,990
I was gone for five minutes.

3208
02:15:54,990 --> 02:15:55,250
Wait.

3209
02:15:57,110 --> 02:15:59,070
This doesn't look like five minutes.

3210
02:16:00,810 --> 02:16:03,130
You've been gone a long time.

3211
02:16:05,020 --> 02:16:06,100
Wait a minute.

3212
02:16:06,500 --> 02:16:06,720
I didn't know what to do.

3213
02:16:06,960 --> 02:16:08,180
You left me here.

3214
02:16:08,520 --> 02:16:09,020
Again.

3215
02:16:10,480 --> 02:16:11,620
Why don't you care?

3216
02:16:14,900 --> 02:16:15,700
That's impossible.

3217
02:16:20,260 --> 02:16:21,800
We should go before they come.

3218
02:16:21,800 --> 02:16:22,700
Wait, you can do this?

3219
02:16:23,880 --> 02:16:27,620
Why the fuck am I beating these people up?

3220
02:16:29,080 --> 02:16:30,940
Wait, maybe I should upgrade the boy.

3221
02:16:32,520 --> 02:16:33,040
Yes.

3222
02:16:36,510 --> 02:16:38,210
Okay, but what if I go back in?

3223
02:16:38,210 --> 02:16:40,430
But there's no way to get back in.

3224
02:16:40,430 --> 02:16:40,910
What if...

3225
02:16:43,030 --> 02:16:45,310
What if I just go back in though?

3226
02:16:46,210 --> 02:16:47,010
What if I just go back in though?

3227
02:16:47,010 --> 02:16:47,750
What if we both go in?

3228
02:16:47,810 --> 02:16:50,110
Boy, we can live in this happy world forever.

3229
02:16:51,990 --> 02:16:52,470
What if we both go in?

3230
02:16:52,470 --> 02:16:54,090
Your dead mom is alive in there.

3231
02:16:56,550 --> 02:16:57,750
That's all I'm saying.

3232
02:16:59,050 --> 02:17:00,210
Boy, your bow.

3233
02:17:02,790 --> 02:17:03,610
Hold it out.

3234
02:17:06,130 --> 02:17:07,490
Wait, what's this?

3235
02:17:07,610 --> 02:17:07,630
Wait, what's this?

3236
02:17:09,030 --> 02:17:10,410
What the fuck is this?

3237
02:17:11,950 --> 02:17:13,770
I'm accepting for who he is!

3238
02:17:14,750 --> 02:17:15,650
A pussy!

3239
02:17:16,350 --> 02:17:18,050
You have acquired light arrows.

3240
02:17:18,170 --> 02:17:20,430
Shoot them at light crystals to infuse them.

3241
02:17:20,730 --> 02:17:21,650
Oh my god!

3242
02:17:21,810 --> 02:17:25,010
I'm letting him do what he's passionate about!

3243
02:17:28,290 --> 02:17:28,890
Alright.

3244
02:17:29,230 --> 02:17:33,330
See, I'm getting past my prejudice and letting him use elf magic.

3245
02:17:36,670 --> 02:17:37,570
There we go.

3246
02:17:38,210 --> 02:17:38,690
We did it.

3247
02:17:40,570 --> 02:17:41,950
I'm a good dad.

3248
02:17:42,150 --> 02:17:43,850
I accept him for who he is.

3249
02:17:44,290 --> 02:17:45,270
Little bitch.

3250
02:17:45,810 --> 02:17:46,550
Alright, let's go.

3251
02:17:51,150 --> 02:17:52,370
It's not the way to go?

3252
02:17:52,670 --> 02:17:54,130
Where the fuck is the other way?

3253
02:17:54,130 --> 02:17:54,990
Oh, it's down here.

3254
02:17:55,510 --> 02:17:55,990
Alright.

3255
02:17:57,950 --> 02:17:59,130
I'm so supportive!

3256
02:18:00,270 --> 02:18:01,970
I might not understand it.

3257
02:18:01,990 --> 02:18:06,230
I might not understand him and his interests, but I accept him.

3258
02:18:07,430 --> 02:18:08,090
That's all.

3259
02:18:08,210 --> 02:18:09,270
That's all that matters, guys.

3260
02:18:10,830 --> 02:18:11,790
Best parent.

3261
02:18:13,470 --> 02:18:14,430
You know what?

3262
02:18:14,630 --> 02:18:15,970
Oh my god, he should have magic now!

3263
02:18:17,410 --> 02:18:17,890
Okay.

3264
02:18:18,190 --> 02:18:22,550
Light arrows increases light arrows inflict- Oh, I like that!

3265
02:18:22,910 --> 02:18:24,210
We need more stun damage.

3266
02:18:24,670 --> 02:18:25,490
Alright, nice.

3267
02:18:25,690 --> 02:18:25,910
Okay.

3268
02:18:27,570 --> 02:18:30,930
Wait, does that mean like he can do that?

3269
02:18:31,210 --> 02:18:33,650
Wait, how does he shoot in it?

3270
02:18:35,350 --> 02:18:35,830
Okay.

3271
02:18:35,890 --> 02:18:36,250
Nope.

3272
02:18:36,450 --> 02:18:37,490
That's not how it works.

3273
02:18:38,350 --> 02:18:39,110
I don't know.

3274
02:18:39,210 --> 02:18:40,070
I thought that was how it works.

3275
02:18:40,190 --> 02:18:40,650
Oh, okay.

3276
02:18:40,710 --> 02:18:41,670
I need to put the- Oh!

3277
02:18:47,650 --> 02:18:51,130
Way to break the Asian parent style.

3278
02:18:51,930 --> 02:18:55,710
I swear, thank you for the super super chat, too.

3279
02:18:55,910 --> 02:18:57,630
Thank you for the super chat.

3280
02:18:57,710 --> 02:18:58,870
Thank you, thank you.

3281
02:19:00,950 --> 02:19:07,110
I may or may not approve his choices, but I'm here to support you.

3282
02:19:09,830 --> 02:19:10,870
Alright, nice.

3283
02:19:11,130 --> 02:19:12,310
I broke the cycle.

3284
02:19:14,010 --> 02:19:15,410
Oh, again.

3285
02:19:15,790 --> 02:19:16,630
Wait, yeah.

3286
02:19:16,830 --> 02:19:18,390
That's the same attachment thing.

3287
02:19:19,190 --> 02:19:20,250
Okay, let's see.

3288
02:19:20,290 --> 02:19:21,810
Can I take the crystal away?

3289
02:19:24,850 --> 02:19:25,470
Alright.

3290
02:19:26,350 --> 02:19:26,970
See?

3291
02:19:28,110 --> 02:19:31,070
Boy, you can be a magician if you want.

3292
02:19:32,030 --> 02:19:33,250
Alright, let's see.

3293
02:19:34,230 --> 02:19:35,830
The cycle is broken.

3294
02:19:37,150 --> 02:19:37,770
Alright.

3295
02:19:38,610 --> 02:19:39,230
Phew!

3296
02:19:40,070 --> 02:19:40,690
Okay.

3297
02:19:42,070 --> 02:19:43,390
Where does this take me?

3298
02:19:44,490 --> 02:19:46,450
Okay, but like, can I shoot that?

3299
02:19:48,430 --> 02:19:48,870
Oh!

3300
02:19:48,870 --> 02:19:49,310
Okay.

3301
02:19:49,610 --> 02:19:51,490
That was like, I went in advance.

3302
02:19:54,270 --> 02:19:54,710
Alright.

3303
02:19:54,710 --> 02:19:55,890
We go this way.

3304
02:19:58,470 --> 02:19:59,350
And then...

3305
02:19:59,350 --> 02:19:59,550
Oh!

3306
02:20:02,450 --> 02:20:02,890
Oh.

3307
02:20:04,710 --> 02:20:05,910
Is it all light?

3308
02:20:06,010 --> 02:20:07,070
Oh, it's all light.

3309
02:20:07,270 --> 02:20:07,710
Okay.

3310
02:20:08,810 --> 02:20:09,670
That's interesting.

3311
02:20:09,930 --> 02:20:10,970
It was all light.

3312
02:20:11,030 --> 02:20:11,170
Oh!

3313
02:20:12,070 --> 02:20:13,650
Okay, there is... Oh, shit!

3314
02:20:14,790 --> 02:20:15,750
Go, boy, go!

3315
02:20:16,090 --> 02:20:16,910
Use your...

3316
02:20:17,830 --> 02:20:19,010
Use your magic arrows.

3317
02:20:19,810 --> 02:20:21,270
You may never learn.

3318
02:20:22,030 --> 02:20:24,650
You may never have muscles, but that's okay.

3319
02:20:25,270 --> 02:20:28,030
I sort of figured out you will never have muscles.

3320
02:20:28,350 --> 02:20:29,630
Oh, I have an axe.

3321
02:20:33,590 --> 02:20:36,330
This is how you actually kill them.

3322
02:20:38,570 --> 02:20:41,550
I had a feeling you will never have muscles, boy.

3323
02:20:46,510 --> 02:20:50,390
Clearly you got your mother's genes and not my genes.

3324
02:20:53,570 --> 02:20:54,050
Alright.

3325
02:20:54,150 --> 02:20:54,910
Let's see.

3326
02:20:57,130 --> 02:20:57,950
Oh, wait.

3327
02:20:58,030 --> 02:20:58,350
What's this?

3328
02:20:58,450 --> 02:20:58,790
Oh, loot!

3329
02:20:58,970 --> 02:20:59,370
Oh, no.

3330
02:20:59,410 --> 02:20:59,730
Not loot.

3331
02:20:59,790 --> 02:21:00,250
They're just dead.

3332
02:21:01,070 --> 02:21:01,550
Oops.

3333
02:21:04,070 --> 02:21:04,550
Alright.

3334
02:21:05,090 --> 02:21:05,570
Nice.

3335
02:21:06,870 --> 02:21:07,350
Okay.

3336
02:21:09,150 --> 02:21:09,770
Wait, what?

3337
02:21:09,990 --> 02:21:10,410
Oh.

3338
02:21:11,670 --> 02:21:12,210
Okay.

3339
02:21:12,310 --> 02:21:12,690
Don't worry.

3340
02:21:13,630 --> 02:21:14,170
Wait.

3341
02:21:14,790 --> 02:21:15,110
What?

3342
02:21:16,410 --> 02:21:16,950
What?

3343
02:21:16,990 --> 02:21:17,250
Oh!

3344
02:21:17,490 --> 02:21:17,830
That!

3345
02:21:18,950 --> 02:21:19,490
Pew!

3346
02:21:19,490 --> 02:21:19,770
Pew!

3347
02:21:19,810 --> 02:21:20,110
Pew!

3348
02:21:20,110 --> 02:21:20,450
Pew!

3349
02:21:20,450 --> 02:21:20,810
Pew!

3350
02:21:22,550 --> 02:21:23,090
Pew!

3351
02:21:23,450 --> 02:21:24,810
Where is the other guy?

3352
02:21:25,150 --> 02:21:25,690
Pew!

3353
02:21:25,690 --> 02:21:26,030
Pew!

3354
02:21:26,050 --> 02:21:26,370
Pew!

3355
02:21:26,410 --> 02:21:26,710
Pew!

3356
02:21:27,270 --> 02:21:28,730
I don't want to walk over there.

3357
02:21:29,130 --> 02:21:30,250
I'm like...

3358
02:21:32,230 --> 02:21:33,110
Alright, boy.

3359
02:21:33,150 --> 02:21:33,790
Do your thing.

3360
02:21:34,830 --> 02:21:35,710
Get closer.

3361
02:21:37,490 --> 02:21:38,490
Oh, my God.

3362
02:21:38,530 --> 02:21:39,130
He is so far.

3363
02:21:40,410 --> 02:21:40,630
That's fine.

3364
02:21:41,590 --> 02:21:44,130
If he doesn't want to get closer, that's fine by me.

3365
02:21:45,330 --> 02:21:45,850
Like...

3366
02:21:46,410 --> 02:21:46,850
Pew!

3367
02:21:48,870 --> 02:21:49,390
Pew!

3368
02:21:50,470 --> 02:21:50,990
Pew!

3369
02:21:52,890 --> 02:21:54,730
I mean, that's on him.

3370
02:21:56,230 --> 02:21:57,930
It's his fault for not getting closer.

3371
02:22:00,710 --> 02:22:01,230
Wait.

3372
02:22:01,350 --> 02:22:04,770
If I just upgrade, boy, do I never have to fight again?

3373
02:22:05,950 --> 02:22:06,470
Hmm.

3374
02:22:09,070 --> 02:22:10,150
Hahahaha!

3375
02:22:12,530 --> 02:22:13,610
Alright.

3376
02:22:14,630 --> 02:22:15,710
Actually...

3377
02:22:17,070 --> 02:22:18,570
Let's see.

3378
02:22:26,340 --> 02:22:26,880
Alright.

3379
02:22:29,020 --> 02:22:30,100
Alright.

3380
02:22:34,090 --> 02:22:35,170
Yeah.

3381
02:22:36,630 --> 02:22:37,170
Alright.

3382
02:22:39,010 --> 02:22:40,790
I figured it out.

3383
02:22:41,090 --> 02:22:41,870
I figured it out.

3384
02:22:41,870 --> 02:22:44,450
I figured it out.

3385
02:22:44,450 --> 02:22:45,270
Hmm.

3386
02:22:46,510 --> 02:22:48,410
Let us make our way back up.

3387
02:22:48,670 --> 02:22:49,110
What do you mean?

3388
02:22:49,570 --> 02:22:51,170
Let me find an angle.

3389
02:22:51,330 --> 02:22:51,990
I fucking...

3390
02:22:52,890 --> 02:22:54,010
It's just one shot.

3391
02:22:55,810 --> 02:22:56,890
What are you looking at?

3392
02:22:58,170 --> 02:22:58,650
Oh.

3393
02:22:59,790 --> 02:23:00,270
That.

3394
02:23:02,030 --> 02:23:02,510
Okay.

3395
02:23:04,270 --> 02:23:05,870
Wait, but what's over there then?

3396
02:23:06,550 --> 02:23:08,050
Oh, it just goes back.

3397
02:23:08,330 --> 02:23:09,570
Wait, what did I do?

3398
02:23:12,230 --> 02:23:13,670
Why would I need to go back?

3399
02:23:14,670 --> 02:23:15,150
Why would I need to go back?

3400
02:23:15,150 --> 02:23:16,250
I guess it's a shortcut?

3401
02:23:16,690 --> 02:23:17,170
I guess it's a shortcut?

3402
02:23:17,930 --> 02:23:18,410
Alright.

3403
02:23:18,490 --> 02:23:18,790
Nice.

3404
02:23:20,450 --> 02:23:22,170
Guys, why did you not tell me?

3405
02:23:22,250 --> 02:23:22,890
Guys, look.

3406
02:23:23,270 --> 02:23:27,190
After accepting my boy for what he is, I now...

3407
02:23:27,190 --> 02:23:33,110
Now I realize that he is gonna grow up and take care of me.

3408
02:23:34,230 --> 02:23:36,510
Now that I've accepted him for who he is.

3409
02:23:37,070 --> 02:23:37,830
Look at that.

3410
02:23:37,870 --> 02:23:39,470
That's character development right there.

3411
02:23:39,570 --> 02:23:40,170
Hahaha.

3412
02:23:44,490 --> 02:23:45,870
Defy your arrows!

3413
02:23:46,390 --> 02:23:47,690
Defy your arrows!

3414
02:23:48,490 --> 02:23:49,470
Defying it!

3415
02:23:49,850 --> 02:23:50,530
Hahaha.

3416
02:23:54,560 --> 02:23:55,540
Now he'll...

3417
02:23:55,540 --> 02:23:57,200
Now he'll have to take care of me.

3418
02:23:57,460 --> 02:23:58,500
Oh shit!

3419
02:23:58,620 --> 02:23:59,060
You're free!

3420
02:23:59,120 --> 02:23:59,400
Okay.

3421
02:24:00,800 --> 02:24:04,340
I realize I fought the wrong guy.

3422
02:24:04,760 --> 02:24:07,120
This is the guy that's important.

3423
02:24:07,780 --> 02:24:08,460
Alright.

3424
02:24:10,100 --> 02:24:11,080
Alright, nice.

3425
02:24:11,700 --> 02:24:13,460
Now he won't put me in the home.

3426
02:24:15,360 --> 02:24:16,400
Alright, let's see.

3427
02:24:16,560 --> 02:24:17,280
Grab that.

3428
02:24:18,660 --> 02:24:19,620
To upgrade...

3429
02:24:19,620 --> 02:24:20,460
Oh, wait.

3430
02:24:20,520 --> 02:24:21,400
No, I already upgraded it.

3431
02:24:21,920 --> 02:24:23,580
What am I supposed to shoot at?

3432
02:24:24,800 --> 02:24:25,680
Oh shit.

3433
02:24:25,760 --> 02:24:26,120
I'm lost.

3434
02:24:27,700 --> 02:24:28,840
Where am I?

3435
02:24:30,540 --> 02:24:31,620
Do I go up here?

3436
02:24:31,960 --> 02:24:32,880
Oh, I go up here!

3437
02:24:36,740 --> 02:24:37,700
Retirement saved!

3438
02:24:38,860 --> 02:24:39,340
Alright.

3439
02:24:40,880 --> 02:24:42,080
This should be it.

3440
02:24:44,260 --> 02:24:44,820
Right?

3441
02:24:45,100 --> 02:24:46,980
Oh, it's not.

3442
02:24:50,280 --> 02:24:51,380
Wait, is that the...

3443
02:24:51,380 --> 02:24:52,640
Reinforcement guy?

3444
02:24:54,140 --> 02:24:55,180
Come on, shoot him!

3445
02:24:55,380 --> 02:24:56,080
Shoot him!

3446
02:24:56,440 --> 02:24:57,320
Keep shooting him!

3447
02:24:57,780 --> 02:24:58,580
Oh shit!

3448
02:24:59,140 --> 02:25:00,240
That's fucking right.

3449
02:25:02,500 --> 02:25:04,160
My boy knows magic!

3450
02:25:05,240 --> 02:25:06,980
I don't know what to...

3451
02:25:07,720 --> 02:25:12,600
I still don't understand what it is, but if he enjoys it, that's all that matters, right?

3452
02:25:13,360 --> 02:25:13,940
Dude!

3453
02:25:14,660 --> 02:25:15,780
Wait, where did he go?

3454
02:25:17,780 --> 02:25:18,600
Chest time.

3455
02:25:21,280 --> 02:25:22,640
Psycho's not broken.

3456
02:25:27,660 --> 02:25:28,780
Alright, nice.

3457
02:25:29,980 --> 02:25:31,140
Not go there?

3458
02:25:32,380 --> 02:25:36,020
Does light magic versus light magic not work against each other?

3459
02:25:36,080 --> 02:25:36,460
Does light magic versus light magic not work against each other?

3460
02:25:36,460 --> 02:25:36,560
Does light magic versus light magic not work against each other?

3461
02:25:39,240 --> 02:25:40,040
Okay...

3462
02:25:40,040 --> 02:25:40,180
Okay...

3463
02:25:41,260 --> 02:25:42,820
Where the fuck do I go?

3464
02:25:43,840 --> 02:25:45,380
Where the fuck do I go?

3465
02:25:47,040 --> 02:25:47,840
Uh...

3466
02:25:49,540 --> 02:25:50,340
Oh.

3467
02:25:50,520 --> 02:25:51,020
This.

3468
02:25:51,820 --> 02:25:52,900
There you go.

3469
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:56,620
And then we put the crystal.

3470
02:26:00,060 --> 02:26:02,040
Gamers don't look up.

3471
02:26:02,800 --> 02:26:03,600
Boop!

3472
02:26:06,980 --> 02:26:07,160
Light it?

3473
02:26:07,920 --> 02:26:08,500
Light it.

3474
02:26:09,380 --> 02:26:09,800
Read!

3475
02:26:10,780 --> 02:26:11,200
Boy.

3476
02:26:12,940 --> 02:26:13,900
It's reading time.

3477
02:26:20,050 --> 02:26:21,110
Oh shit, it's gone.

3478
02:26:22,770 --> 02:26:23,910
Did you read it in time?

3479
02:26:25,570 --> 02:26:26,810
Okay, don't tell...

3480
02:26:26,810 --> 02:26:29,590
Oh, just write in your fancy little book and not tell your father.

3481
02:26:30,170 --> 02:26:32,930
Alright, from the light we are born into the light we...

3482
02:26:32,930 --> 02:26:34,890
I'm just gonna read your fucking diary, I guess.

3483
02:26:36,030 --> 02:26:37,450
God, I gave this...

3484
02:26:37,450 --> 02:26:41,210
I let this boy learn magic, and this is how he repays me?

3485
02:26:41,230 --> 02:26:42,030
Wait.

3486
02:26:42,630 --> 02:26:43,610
That's fucked.

3487
02:26:45,230 --> 02:26:46,490
And a sand bowl.

3488
02:26:47,130 --> 02:26:48,990
But how do you expect me to reach it?

3489
02:26:50,210 --> 02:26:51,090
Wait, what?

3490
02:26:53,110 --> 02:26:55,750
Oh shit, I'm going at his back door.

3491
02:26:56,190 --> 02:26:56,790
Alright.

3492
02:26:57,950 --> 02:26:59,250
I'm gonna steal this.

3493
02:27:01,410 --> 02:27:02,610
So unclaimed.

3494
02:27:03,670 --> 02:27:08,750
I told you guys, I only have eyes for one door.

3495
02:27:08,850 --> 02:27:10,270
And one door only.

3496
02:27:12,590 --> 02:27:14,630
You gonna carry that everywhere?

3497
02:27:14,970 --> 02:27:15,670
I just might.

3498
02:27:17,790 --> 02:27:19,150
I told you.

3499
02:27:21,170 --> 02:27:22,370
Alright, let's see.

3500
02:27:26,670 --> 02:27:27,310
Alright.

3501
02:27:27,590 --> 02:27:28,850
Is there anything else I'm missing?

3502
02:27:30,110 --> 02:27:31,070
What's up here?

3503
02:27:33,370 --> 02:27:34,770
Wait, what is up here?

3504
02:27:35,230 --> 02:27:36,170
Oh, chest!

3505
02:27:37,770 --> 02:27:38,410
Okay.

3506
02:27:40,230 --> 02:27:40,870
Uh...

3507
02:27:40,870 --> 02:27:41,350
Whoop.

3508
02:27:43,610 --> 02:27:45,050
Wait, where's the third one?

3509
02:27:46,150 --> 02:27:48,090
Oh no, I don't know where the third one is.

3510
02:27:49,190 --> 02:27:50,530
Oh, it's right here!

3511
02:27:51,670 --> 02:27:52,790
Okay, one...

3512
02:27:54,070 --> 02:27:54,630
Two...

3513
02:27:55,270 --> 02:27:55,830
Three.

3514
02:27:56,670 --> 02:27:57,230
Nice.

3515
02:27:58,010 --> 02:27:59,610
I need to figure out how to get there.

3516
02:28:01,190 --> 02:28:01,750
Oh.

3517
02:28:02,930 --> 02:28:03,610
That's how.

3518
02:28:04,210 --> 02:28:05,430
Alright, easy.

3519
02:28:06,890 --> 02:28:08,370
So fucking easy.

3520
02:28:09,490 --> 02:28:10,430
Up I go.

3521
02:28:10,430 --> 02:28:11,370
Wait.

3522
02:28:12,070 --> 02:28:13,590
I hear, like, nature.

3523
02:28:16,510 --> 02:28:17,050
Alright.

3524
02:28:17,450 --> 02:28:19,950
I hear an animal that's not extinct yet.

3525
02:28:21,030 --> 02:28:21,570
Wait.

3526
02:28:21,730 --> 02:28:22,510
This way.

3527
02:28:22,570 --> 02:28:22,750
Okay.

3528
02:28:26,990 --> 02:28:27,530
Damn!

3529
02:28:32,890 --> 02:28:36,190
I might have supported you, but I still don't respect you.

3530
02:28:36,330 --> 02:28:36,710
Oh!

3531
02:28:36,710 --> 02:28:37,210
Hahaha!

3532
02:28:39,270 --> 02:28:39,950
Hahaha!

3533
02:28:41,870 --> 02:28:43,430
Alright, let's see.

3534
02:28:45,810 --> 02:28:46,490
Uh...

3535
02:28:47,190 --> 02:28:48,450
Go this way.

3536
02:28:49,770 --> 02:28:51,050
And then...

3537
02:28:51,050 --> 02:28:51,190
Oh!

3538
02:28:51,710 --> 02:28:52,690
Oh, there's some...

3539
02:28:52,690 --> 02:28:53,450
Oh, there's plants here.

3540
02:28:53,990 --> 02:28:54,670
Okay...

3541
02:28:54,670 --> 02:28:56,450
Oh, is this the angle?

3542
02:28:57,690 --> 02:28:58,370
No.

3543
02:28:58,510 --> 02:28:59,510
Wait, what's the angle?

3544
02:29:00,690 --> 02:29:01,790
Oh shit.

3545
02:29:01,910 --> 02:29:03,530
Okay, maybe up here?

3546
02:29:07,380 --> 02:29:07,820
Alright.

3547
02:29:08,120 --> 02:29:08,560
Alright.

3548
02:29:08,760 --> 02:29:10,340
We've been standing here a while.

3549
02:29:11,960 --> 02:29:13,140
What the fuck do I...

3550
02:29:13,140 --> 02:29:13,680
Oh, this way.

3551
02:29:13,780 --> 02:29:14,000
Okay.

3552
02:29:15,220 --> 02:29:15,660
Pew!

3553
02:29:17,880 --> 02:29:18,320
Nice.

3554
02:29:20,080 --> 02:29:23,180
Okay, and I came from this direction.

3555
02:29:23,980 --> 02:29:24,420
So...

3556
02:29:25,660 --> 02:29:26,540
I gotta...

3557
02:29:26,540 --> 02:29:27,480
Wait, what did I do?

3558
02:29:27,600 --> 02:29:28,120
Oh, this...

3559
02:29:28,680 --> 02:29:29,380
This is what I did.

3560
02:29:29,540 --> 02:29:29,900
Hahaha!

3561
02:29:30,600 --> 02:29:31,040
Sorry.

3562
02:29:31,400 --> 02:29:33,360
I was like, what the fuck did I do again?

3563
02:29:37,220 --> 02:29:37,840
Alright.

3564
02:29:41,070 --> 02:29:42,310
Put this here.

3565
02:29:46,240 --> 02:29:47,280
Hey, baby door.

3566
02:29:47,540 --> 02:29:48,780
I told you I wouldn't...

3567
02:29:48,780 --> 02:29:50,260
I told you I'll be back.

3568
02:29:50,700 --> 02:29:52,220
Back door, I see.

3569
02:29:52,620 --> 02:29:52,960
Hahaha!

3570
02:29:55,100 --> 02:29:55,720
Hahaha!

3571
02:29:57,240 --> 02:29:57,860
Nice.

3572
02:29:58,240 --> 02:29:58,460
Alright.

3573
02:30:00,360 --> 02:30:02,100
How do I get there?

3574
02:30:02,300 --> 02:30:03,020
What the fuck?

3575
02:30:06,980 --> 02:30:07,600
Uh...

3576
02:30:08,480 --> 02:30:09,080
Uh...

3577
02:30:10,180 --> 02:30:11,280
What the fuck?

3578
02:30:11,620 --> 02:30:13,100
How do I get there?

3579
02:30:14,460 --> 02:30:15,060
Oh!

3580
02:30:15,500 --> 02:30:16,100
Okay.

3581
02:30:16,260 --> 02:30:17,060
Oh, dear!

3582
02:30:18,060 --> 02:30:18,840
Get up.

3583
02:30:32,200 --> 02:30:32,800
Oh,

3584
02:30:40,340 --> 02:30:42,220
I know what I have to do now.

3585
02:30:42,320 --> 02:30:42,920
Hahaha!

3586
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:48,840
Hahaha!

3587
02:30:51,760 --> 02:30:53,780
Oh, that's all it needed.

3588
02:30:53,920 --> 02:30:56,600
It just needed to see.

3589
02:30:56,600 --> 02:30:57,420
Hahaha!

3590
02:30:58,640 --> 02:30:59,480
Hahaha!

3591
02:30:59,880 --> 02:31:01,620
Hey, baby door.

3592
02:31:01,660 --> 02:31:03,400
I'm here to give you what you want.

3593
02:31:03,420 --> 02:31:03,880
Hahaha!

3594
02:31:05,880 --> 02:31:06,300
Oh!

3595
02:31:06,720 --> 02:31:07,920
And it opened!

3596
02:31:08,840 --> 02:31:09,680
Hahaha!

3597
02:31:10,920 --> 02:31:11,760
Hahaha!

3598
02:31:12,360 --> 02:31:13,080
Hahaha!

3599
02:31:15,980 --> 02:31:17,160
I told you guys!

3600
02:31:18,120 --> 02:31:18,860
Hahaha!

3601
02:31:24,730 --> 02:31:25,660
And then...

3602
02:31:25,660 --> 02:31:28,520
And then the door gave birth to light elves.

3603
02:31:35,840 --> 02:31:37,030
It was that easy.

3604
02:31:38,190 --> 02:31:40,290
It was that easy!

3605
02:31:41,590 --> 02:31:42,310
Hahaha!

3606
02:31:43,770 --> 02:31:44,910
Oh my god!

3607
02:31:45,190 --> 02:31:45,930
Hahaha!

3608
02:31:46,690 --> 02:31:50,050
And then the light elves came out.

3609
02:31:50,390 --> 02:31:52,010
The light elves are back!

3610
02:31:53,110 --> 02:31:58,230
We freed the light of Elfhelm from whatever dark elves were doing to it, and they all returned to the temple.

3611
02:31:58,390 --> 02:32:01,250
Everything is beautiful in Elfhelm.

3612
02:32:01,410 --> 02:32:04,150
Now that the light shines free, the light elves seem nice.

3613
02:32:04,530 --> 02:32:06,990
They don't really say anything, but at least they aren't trying to kill us.

3614
02:32:07,370 --> 02:32:10,310
Father says I shouldn't assume anything, but what does he know?

3615
02:32:10,490 --> 02:32:13,310
He was doing who knows what inside the light...

3616
02:32:13,310 --> 02:32:13,730
Hahaha!

3617
02:32:15,610 --> 02:32:17,310
Father kept touching the door.

3618
02:32:17,670 --> 02:32:19,870
And then the light elves came.

3619
02:32:19,990 --> 02:32:20,470
Hahaha!

3620
02:32:22,010 --> 02:32:24,690
But I had to take down an entire swarm of dark elves by myself.

3621
02:32:24,890 --> 02:32:26,150
I don't care what he says.

3622
02:32:26,410 --> 02:32:28,410
I'm glad we got involved.

3623
02:32:29,250 --> 02:32:30,450
I saved them!

3624
02:32:31,190 --> 02:32:31,390
I...

3625
02:32:31,390 --> 02:32:31,630
Oh!

3626
02:32:32,210 --> 02:32:33,790
My controller, do you see there?

3627
02:32:34,450 --> 02:32:35,830
Oh shit!

3628
02:32:35,930 --> 02:32:36,230
What?

3629
02:32:37,570 --> 02:32:38,650
What does he want now?

3630
02:32:38,970 --> 02:32:39,650
Yeah, what does he want?

3631
02:32:40,610 --> 02:32:41,410
Is he mad?

3632
02:32:42,810 --> 02:32:43,870
He's very mad.

3633
02:32:44,190 --> 02:32:44,950
Why he mad?

3634
02:32:46,130 --> 02:32:47,090
What did I do?

3635
02:32:47,410 --> 02:32:50,370
I just... I was just comforting the door.

3636
02:32:50,930 --> 02:32:51,450
Hahaha!

3637
02:32:52,010 --> 02:32:54,930
I took you seriously out here saving a species.

3638
02:32:55,610 --> 02:32:57,190
I told you guys.

3639
02:32:58,010 --> 02:33:01,730
My eyes are only for one door and one door only.

3640
02:33:04,150 --> 02:33:05,870
You took his door.

3641
02:33:06,790 --> 02:33:08,870
That door didn't even love him.

3642
02:33:11,070 --> 02:33:15,590
I bet like... I bet that door didn't even let him use the back entrance.

3643
02:33:18,210 --> 02:33:19,450
What do we have to do?

3644
02:33:19,510 --> 02:33:20,330
What do we have to do?

3645
02:33:23,230 --> 02:33:25,210
We really gotta go back down here again?

3646
02:33:25,510 --> 02:33:26,730
Oh, this is the...

3647
02:33:27,250 --> 02:33:28,770
Is this the fast pass?

3648
02:33:29,090 --> 02:33:29,250
Oh.

3649
02:33:30,910 --> 02:33:31,350
Okay.

3650
02:33:32,410 --> 02:33:34,630
I guess we go back this way, I guess.

3651
02:33:36,810 --> 02:33:37,690
Down... we...

3652
02:33:38,690 --> 02:33:39,130
go...

3653
02:33:39,950 --> 02:33:42,490
Oh, wait, no, we do go this way.

3654
02:33:42,510 --> 02:33:42,730
What?

3655
02:33:45,810 --> 02:33:47,050
We actually go through here?

3656
02:33:50,900 --> 02:33:51,660
What the fuck?

3657
02:33:51,840 --> 02:33:52,680
How do I access?

3658
02:33:52,720 --> 02:33:52,840
Oh.

3659
02:33:53,900 --> 02:33:54,500
This.

3660
02:33:55,460 --> 02:33:56,060
Yippee!

3661
02:34:00,140 --> 02:34:02,420
I can't believe the rune red seed.

3662
02:34:06,480 --> 02:34:08,320
The joke's right itself.

3663
02:34:08,900 --> 02:34:11,600
I don't even need to try to be a content creator.

3664
02:34:11,940 --> 02:34:14,000
It just falls right into my lap.

3665
02:34:20,200 --> 02:34:21,500
Okay, nice.

3666
02:34:21,800 --> 02:34:22,720
Spoilers of war.

3667
02:34:23,040 --> 02:34:24,200
Oh, shit, nice.

3668
02:34:29,820 --> 02:34:30,940
Give me the loot.

3669
02:34:31,080 --> 02:34:33,860
The war is over, so I can rob some more graves.

3670
02:34:34,760 --> 02:34:35,920
Wonder if I could, like...

3671
02:34:35,920 --> 02:34:37,360
There isn't a way back up from here, you know.

3672
02:34:37,600 --> 02:34:38,380
I know.

3673
02:34:39,940 --> 02:34:40,860
Anything out here?

3674
02:34:42,220 --> 02:34:42,660
Alright.

3675
02:34:44,080 --> 02:34:45,280
I guess we go this way.

3676
02:34:46,640 --> 02:34:47,080
Pew!

3677
02:34:48,800 --> 02:34:49,240
Whoa!

3678
02:34:49,240 --> 02:34:50,400
There's rain here?

3679
02:34:53,100 --> 02:34:55,080
I thought we won the war!

3680
02:34:56,760 --> 02:34:58,320
How the f- Whoa!

3681
02:34:59,800 --> 02:35:00,320
Pew!

3682
02:35:00,340 --> 02:35:00,660
Pew!

3683
02:35:00,780 --> 02:35:01,120
Pew!

3684
02:35:01,140 --> 02:35:01,560
Pew!

3685
02:35:01,560 --> 02:35:01,960
Pew!

3686
02:35:01,960 --> 02:35:02,320
Pew!

3687
02:35:02,320 --> 02:35:03,240
Oh, wait, my knife.

3688
02:35:03,680 --> 02:35:04,420
My gun.

3689
02:35:04,700 --> 02:35:05,120
Pew!

3690
02:35:05,180 --> 02:35:05,580
Pew!

3691
02:35:05,660 --> 02:35:05,980
Pew!

3692
02:35:06,060 --> 02:35:06,340
Pew!

3693
02:35:06,420 --> 02:35:06,800
Pew!

3694
02:35:06,800 --> 02:35:07,160
Pew!

3695
02:35:07,160 --> 02:35:07,360
Pew!

3696
02:35:08,820 --> 02:35:09,340
Pew!

3697
02:35:09,340 --> 02:35:09,520
Pew!

3698
02:35:09,580 --> 02:35:10,100
Pew!

3699
02:35:10,100 --> 02:35:10,400
Pew!

3700
02:35:10,480 --> 02:35:10,580
Pew!

3701
02:35:10,580 --> 02:35:10,740
Pew!

3702
02:35:10,860 --> 02:35:10,960
Pew!

3703
02:35:10,960 --> 02:35:11,380
Pew!

3704
02:35:11,620 --> 02:35:12,580
Oh, wait.

3705
02:35:12,960 --> 02:35:13,480
Pew!

3706
02:35:13,480 --> 02:35:14,380
Wait, where did he go?

3707
02:35:15,400 --> 02:35:16,120
There we go.

3708
02:35:16,660 --> 02:35:17,180
Nice.

3709
02:35:18,480 --> 02:35:20,220
And then I need you to hit that.

3710
02:35:20,920 --> 02:35:22,380
Is there anything behind us?

3711
02:35:22,660 --> 02:35:24,020
Oh, there's another witch.

3712
02:35:24,080 --> 02:35:24,580
You know what?

3713
02:35:24,700 --> 02:35:25,400
Fuck you.

3714
02:35:25,460 --> 02:35:27,020
I'm gonna go up close and personal.

3715
02:35:27,520 --> 02:35:28,580
That's fucking right.

3716
02:35:29,580 --> 02:35:30,800
That's fucking right!

3717
02:35:32,380 --> 02:35:34,560
You think you can get away from me?

3718
02:35:36,220 --> 02:35:38,700
What you gonna do with your goddamn magic?

3719
02:35:40,420 --> 02:35:40,900
Nothing!

3720
02:35:42,680 --> 02:35:43,160
Yeah!

3721
02:35:45,600 --> 02:35:47,920
Melee always better than an archery.

3722
02:35:48,560 --> 02:35:50,420
How are we supposed to get across without a crystal?

3723
02:35:50,580 --> 02:35:51,720
Oh, I need a crystal.

3724
02:35:52,600 --> 02:35:54,060
Alright, we gotta find a crystal.

3725
02:35:54,620 --> 02:35:55,820
I guess it'll be over here.

3726
02:35:59,940 --> 02:36:00,400
Oh...

3727
02:36:02,200 --> 02:36:02,660
Oh!

3728
02:36:03,140 --> 02:36:03,940
There's a crystal.

3729
02:36:04,800 --> 02:36:05,260
Oh!

3730
02:36:06,220 --> 02:36:06,680
Oh!

3731
02:36:07,740 --> 02:36:08,200
Oh!

3732
02:36:10,460 --> 02:36:13,280
So hard to see cause it's like black and white.

3733
02:36:14,520 --> 02:36:15,900
Oh, get out of here.

3734
02:36:16,320 --> 02:36:17,660
Get the fuck out of here.

3735
02:36:18,640 --> 02:36:19,840
My boy knows magic.

3736
02:36:21,560 --> 02:36:22,540
That's fucking right.

3737
02:36:22,720 --> 02:36:24,780
The same magic that kept you locked in!

3738
02:36:27,320 --> 02:36:27,840
Alright.

3739
02:36:28,480 --> 02:36:29,600
Oh, you're still alive?

3740
02:36:31,380 --> 02:36:33,800
I wish you would have been dead earlier.

3741
02:36:36,560 --> 02:36:38,280
Is there any loot in there?

3742
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:40,520
No.

3743
02:36:41,940 --> 02:36:42,900
Oh, nice.

3744
02:36:43,120 --> 02:36:43,920
Thank god you're dead.

3745
02:36:44,540 --> 02:36:45,060
Yay!

3746
02:36:45,060 --> 02:36:45,160
Yay!

3747
02:36:46,900 --> 02:36:47,960
Spoilers of war.

3748
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:51,320
And then...

3749
02:36:51,320 --> 02:36:52,180
Vases!

3750
02:36:52,720 --> 02:36:53,380
Goodbye.

3751
02:36:54,770 --> 02:36:56,500
And I'm full HP too.

3752
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:00,660
Alright.

3753
02:37:02,180 --> 02:37:04,360
Time to put the crystal down.

3754
02:37:07,160 --> 02:37:07,860
Let's go.

3755
02:37:11,270 --> 02:37:12,090
Let's see.

3756
02:37:12,270 --> 02:37:15,170
You know, sometimes I wonder if this is even my boy.

3757
02:37:16,530 --> 02:37:19,370
Like, does he even have anything that's related to me?

3758
02:37:21,450 --> 02:37:22,910
Like, where are his muscles?

3759
02:37:24,950 --> 02:37:26,870
Where the fuck are your muscles, boy?

3760
02:37:28,490 --> 02:37:28,970
What?

3761
02:37:30,290 --> 02:37:30,770
Okay.

3762
02:37:30,770 --> 02:37:31,470
Oh, nice.

3763
02:37:31,650 --> 02:37:31,890
Wait.

3764
02:37:33,710 --> 02:37:34,670
Okay, nevermind.

3765
02:37:34,790 --> 02:37:35,430
Just shoot him.

3766
02:37:36,730 --> 02:37:38,390
I'm not putting down my...

3767
02:37:38,390 --> 02:37:39,810
Go, boy, go!

3768
02:37:40,230 --> 02:37:41,490
You got this, boy!

3769
02:37:42,370 --> 02:37:43,270
That's fucking right!

3770
02:37:43,430 --> 02:37:44,270
You got this!

3771
02:37:44,270 --> 02:37:46,230
He's almost dead!

3772
02:37:46,650 --> 02:37:47,490
It's like Pokemon!

3773
02:37:48,350 --> 02:37:49,750
You can do this, boy!

3774
02:37:53,290 --> 02:37:54,610
Where are his muscles?

3775
02:37:54,930 --> 02:37:56,390
Where are his abs?

3776
02:37:59,770 --> 02:38:02,250
How do I even know that's my boy?

3777
02:38:03,210 --> 02:38:05,550
I know Greek and Norse mythology.

3778
02:38:08,010 --> 02:38:09,050
He banged everything.

3779
02:38:12,450 --> 02:38:16,410
The only guy that, like, actually practiced, like...

3780
02:38:16,410 --> 02:38:17,710
Oh, shit, boy!

3781
02:38:18,890 --> 02:38:19,970
You got this!

3782
02:38:22,330 --> 02:38:23,430
Okay, we did it.

3783
02:38:23,850 --> 02:38:24,910
I did it.

3784
02:38:25,510 --> 02:38:30,710
The only guy that actually, like, was faithful to his wife was Hades.

3785
02:38:31,070 --> 02:38:32,770
So, like, how...

3786
02:38:32,770 --> 02:38:34,090
I don't know.

3787
02:38:36,370 --> 02:38:40,690
I don't even know if, like, in Norse mythology, if any of them were ever faithful.

3788
02:38:46,490 --> 02:38:47,090
Alright.

3789
02:38:47,090 --> 02:38:47,690
Nice.

3790
02:38:51,580 --> 02:38:52,620
Alright, nice.

3791
02:38:53,320 --> 02:38:54,800
Hades locked her...

3792
02:38:55,680 --> 02:38:56,720
Hades kidnapped her?

3793
02:38:56,760 --> 02:38:57,700
Yeah, but, like...

3794
02:38:57,700 --> 02:38:59,360
But he was faithful to her!

3795
02:38:59,660 --> 02:39:00,980
He didn't bang another woman!

3796
02:39:02,880 --> 02:39:05,720
He might be kidnapped, but, like...

3797
02:39:05,720 --> 02:39:07,820
That was the one woman for him!

3798
02:39:12,510 --> 02:39:12,930
Okay...

3799
02:39:13,910 --> 02:39:15,190
Am I supposed to go this way?

3800
02:39:17,490 --> 02:39:18,210
Oh, wait, no.

3801
02:39:18,470 --> 02:39:19,810
I'd be going backwards.

3802
02:39:20,670 --> 02:39:21,090
JK!

3803
02:39:22,730 --> 02:39:23,950
I'm supposed to go this way.

3804
02:39:27,530 --> 02:39:27,950
Ummm...

3805
02:39:30,270 --> 02:39:30,690
Almost!

3806
02:39:30,690 --> 02:39:31,670
Doesn't mean he did!

3807
02:39:35,770 --> 02:39:40,130
Okay, I don't need the health, but I just did it as, like, intimidation.

3808
02:39:41,430 --> 02:39:41,850
Whoa!

3809
02:39:43,610 --> 02:39:44,090
Oh, get out!

3810
02:39:44,150 --> 02:39:44,430
Get out!

3811
02:39:45,050 --> 02:39:45,930
No touchy!

3812
02:39:46,490 --> 02:39:47,130
Six feet!

3813
02:39:47,810 --> 02:39:48,250
Pew!

3814
02:39:48,250 --> 02:39:48,550
Pew!

3815
02:39:48,630 --> 02:39:48,990
Pew!

3816
02:39:49,110 --> 02:39:49,550
Pew!

3817
02:39:49,550 --> 02:39:49,990
Pew!

3818
02:39:50,050 --> 02:39:50,490
Pew!

3819
02:39:51,990 --> 02:39:52,430
Pew!

3820
02:39:52,430 --> 02:39:52,490
Pew!

3821
02:39:52,490 --> 02:39:52,650
Pew!

3822
02:39:52,690 --> 02:39:52,830
Oh!

3823
02:39:53,810 --> 02:39:56,010
Oh, shit!

3824
02:39:56,610 --> 02:39:57,930
That's right, I'm angry now!

3825
02:39:58,330 --> 02:39:59,230
That's fucking right!

3826
02:39:59,290 --> 02:39:59,870
Double team!

3827
02:40:00,510 --> 02:40:01,850
I'm gonna double team!

3828
02:40:03,490 --> 02:40:04,570
That's right, what are you gonna do now?

3829
02:40:04,750 --> 02:40:05,410
Fucking fly?

3830
02:40:05,910 --> 02:40:06,350
Wait.

3831
02:40:07,230 --> 02:40:07,910
Oh, shit.

3832
02:40:07,950 --> 02:40:08,130
Okay.

3833
02:40:09,050 --> 02:40:10,250
Wait, wait, wait.

3834
02:40:10,410 --> 02:40:11,550
Wait, he did fly!

3835
02:40:15,610 --> 02:40:16,330
That's fucked!

3836
02:40:16,570 --> 02:40:17,050
That's fucked!

3837
02:40:17,970 --> 02:40:20,570
I can't believe he actually used his wings!

3838
02:40:21,010 --> 02:40:22,170
That should be illegal!

3839
02:40:25,990 --> 02:40:27,290
Oh, oh, oh no!

3840
02:40:27,630 --> 02:40:28,790
Okay, where is he?

3841
02:40:29,130 --> 02:40:29,850
Where is he?

3842
02:40:31,670 --> 02:40:32,150
Okay.

3843
02:40:32,150 --> 02:40:32,910
Get down!

3844
02:40:33,050 --> 02:40:33,530
Get down!

3845
02:40:33,830 --> 02:40:34,230
Oh!

3846
02:40:36,930 --> 02:40:38,630
That's fucking right, I'm gonna swing now!

3847
02:40:40,510 --> 02:40:41,810
Oh no, where did he go?

3848
02:40:42,390 --> 02:40:43,270
Where did he go?

3849
02:40:44,110 --> 02:40:45,010
That's fucking right.

3850
02:40:46,890 --> 02:40:47,330
Alright.

3851
02:40:48,430 --> 02:40:49,270
Where did he go?

3852
02:40:49,270 --> 02:40:49,750
Where did he go?

3853
02:40:49,910 --> 02:40:52,110
That's okay, the boy knows where he went!

3854
02:40:53,670 --> 02:40:54,110
Okay.

3855
02:40:55,730 --> 02:40:56,990
Get down from here!

3856
02:40:57,230 --> 02:40:58,090
Get down!

3857
02:40:58,390 --> 02:40:59,270
Get down!

3858
02:40:59,870 --> 02:41:00,690
Get down!

3859
02:41:01,330 --> 02:41:02,170
Get down!

3860
02:41:03,710 --> 02:41:04,970
Oh, I parried!

3861
02:41:05,110 --> 02:41:06,670
I told you I know how to parry!

3862
02:41:07,530 --> 02:41:08,850
Oh, where did he go?

3863
02:41:09,570 --> 02:41:10,010
Huh?

3864
02:41:10,470 --> 02:41:10,910
Oh!

3865
02:41:10,950 --> 02:41:11,570
What the fuck?

3866
02:41:13,290 --> 02:41:15,410
Where did he go?

3867
02:41:15,990 --> 02:41:16,830
Where did he go?

3868
02:41:16,830 --> 02:41:17,370
Where did he go?

3869
02:41:17,370 --> 02:41:18,370
Yeah, not so tough now!

3870
02:41:18,810 --> 02:41:19,270
Oh!

3871
02:41:21,650 --> 02:41:22,950
I can't see him!

3872
02:41:23,470 --> 02:41:24,650
I can't see him!

3873
02:41:25,910 --> 02:41:27,450
Boy, you know where he is, right?

3874
02:41:28,350 --> 02:41:28,810
Oh!

3875
02:41:31,430 --> 02:41:32,350
That's fucking right!

3876
02:41:35,290 --> 02:41:35,750
Nice!

3877
02:41:35,830 --> 02:41:36,430
One more hit!

3878
02:41:36,590 --> 02:41:37,270
You know what, boy?

3879
02:41:37,330 --> 02:41:38,790
I'll give you the pleasure!

3880
02:41:38,790 --> 02:41:39,050
You know what, boy?

3881
02:41:39,050 --> 02:41:39,050
I'll give you the pleasure!

3882
02:41:41,090 --> 02:41:43,430
I'll give you the pleasure of beating him like Pokemon!

3883
02:41:43,810 --> 02:41:44,010
I'll give you the pleasure of beating him like Pokemon!

3884
02:41:44,990 --> 02:41:45,930
I think...

3885
02:41:46,630 --> 02:41:47,730
Is he shooting him?

3886
02:41:48,470 --> 02:41:49,590
You got this, boy!

3887
02:41:49,810 --> 02:41:50,710
Oh, finisher!

3888
02:41:53,070 --> 02:41:54,710
Boy has better eyesight!

3889
02:41:54,710 --> 02:41:54,730
Boy has better eyesight!

3890
02:41:58,370 --> 02:41:58,850
Nice!

3891
02:42:01,790 --> 02:42:02,930
Where's your queen now?

3892
02:42:03,470 --> 02:42:03,690
Where's your queen now?

3893
02:42:03,690 --> 02:42:04,950
I see you're out!

3894
02:42:05,630 --> 02:42:09,280
No, that can't be!

3895
02:42:09,600 --> 02:42:10,620
What did it say?

3896
02:42:11,100 --> 02:42:13,120
That we made a grave mistake!

3897
02:42:13,540 --> 02:42:13,860
Huh?

3898
02:42:15,840 --> 02:42:16,440
Wait...

3899
02:42:16,440 --> 02:42:17,860
Are the night elves?

3900
02:42:19,240 --> 02:42:21,000
Let me guess...

3901
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,640
You're gonna be smug and say you told me we shouldn't get involved!

3902
02:42:24,080 --> 02:42:24,820
That is enough!

3903
02:42:25,480 --> 02:42:26,400
Here we go now!

3904
02:42:28,040 --> 02:42:28,640
Wait...

3905
02:42:29,520 --> 02:42:30,720
A wolf?!

3906
02:42:32,100 --> 02:42:32,700
Sorry!

3907
02:42:33,760 --> 02:42:35,140
We don't care about that!

3908
02:42:35,220 --> 02:42:35,620
I got it!

3909
02:42:35,640 --> 02:42:36,660
I got a wolf powers now!

3910
02:42:43,660 --> 02:42:44,940
Who cares?

3911
02:42:45,180 --> 02:42:46,280
Someone died!

3912
02:42:47,080 --> 02:42:48,020
Oh my god!

3913
02:42:54,320 --> 02:42:55,700
Sorry, what did he say?

3914
02:42:55,980 --> 02:42:56,780
Who cares?

3915
02:42:56,960 --> 02:42:58,240
Now we have dog powers!

3916
02:42:59,960 --> 02:43:01,000
Alright, nice!

3917
02:43:02,120 --> 02:43:03,660
We helped the wrong side?

3918
02:43:04,120 --> 02:43:05,080
But how?

3919
02:43:05,640 --> 02:43:06,700
They're ugly!

3920
02:43:09,700 --> 02:43:11,120
But the night elves!

3921
02:43:11,500 --> 02:43:12,640
They're beautiful!

3922
02:43:13,120 --> 02:43:14,000
And the night elves!

3923
02:43:14,100 --> 02:43:14,620
They're ugly!

3924
02:43:15,940 --> 02:43:17,080
What do you mean?

3925
02:43:19,540 --> 02:43:21,280
Do you remember the answer?

3926
02:43:21,480 --> 02:43:21,600
Yeah, yeah.

3927
02:43:27,410 --> 02:43:28,730
Is it seed?

3928
02:43:29,130 --> 02:43:29,810
What's that?

3929
02:43:30,850 --> 02:43:32,190
Boy, read this!

3930
02:43:32,410 --> 02:43:34,070
Boy, what's that say?

3931
02:43:34,690 --> 02:43:35,570
Well, I'm sorry!

3932
02:43:35,930 --> 02:43:39,130
I worked my entire life to send you to fucking college!

3933
02:43:39,550 --> 02:43:41,810
The only time you cared to talk to me I didn't get the answer!

3934
02:43:41,830 --> 02:43:43,190
You don't get the education that you have!

3935
02:43:43,490 --> 02:43:46,750
If your mother was still alive, we would not be here at all!

3936
02:43:47,790 --> 02:43:48,350
If your mother was still alive, we would not be here at all!

3937
02:43:48,350 --> 02:43:50,970
I work all day to pay for your tuition!

3938
02:43:51,310 --> 02:43:52,070
Forget it!

3939
02:43:52,170 --> 02:43:54,470
And you can't fucking read for me?

3940
02:43:54,750 --> 02:43:55,210
I let you learn the pussy magic, shit!

3941
02:43:57,990 --> 02:44:01,290
I let you learn the pussy magic, shit!

3942
02:44:02,370 --> 02:44:05,330
I might not understand it but I supported it!

3943
02:44:06,790 --> 02:44:07,350
I let you learn the pussy magic, shit!

3944
02:44:07,350 --> 02:44:08,250
You see these bare hands?

3945
02:44:08,850 --> 02:44:10,510
That's your dead half sister!

3946
02:44:10,510 --> 02:44:12,810
That could have been you!

3947
02:44:13,510 --> 02:44:15,930
Alright, this is it.

3948
02:44:18,790 --> 02:44:20,250
Alright, let's see.

3949
02:44:21,110 --> 02:44:23,430
We gotta go this way!

3950
02:44:42,600 --> 02:44:45,980
How dare you!

3951
02:44:46,600 --> 02:44:48,460
We made you!

3952
02:44:48,720 --> 02:44:49,980
You came for my falls!

3953
02:44:53,440 --> 02:44:55,680
It's not my fault I failed a quick time event.

3954
02:45:03,840 --> 02:45:05,180
That's fucking right.

3955
02:45:23,570 --> 02:45:24,290
Damn.

3956
02:45:32,750 --> 02:45:34,190
Oh shit!

3957
02:45:42,810 --> 02:45:44,490
Is there more?

3958
02:45:44,810 --> 02:45:47,630
I feel like I already explored everything from here.

3959
02:45:49,090 --> 02:45:50,970
Did I actually help the round?

3960
02:45:51,070 --> 02:45:53,250
It's sad the elves can't work things out.

3961
02:45:53,670 --> 02:45:57,370
I'll find such a beautiful place, but war makes it ugly.

3962
02:45:57,770 --> 02:45:58,850
Like how could they?

3963
02:45:59,250 --> 02:45:59,930
You see in the eyes of a child.

3964
02:46:00,210 --> 02:46:03,830
In war, a soldier sees beauty only in the blood of his enemy.

3965
02:46:04,070 --> 02:46:07,790
The rest of him is lost, sometimes never to return.

3966
02:46:08,230 --> 02:46:12,030
You know about war, don't you?

3967
02:46:13,150 --> 02:46:15,130
I'm literally a god of war.

3968
02:46:16,030 --> 02:46:16,510
Sis!

3969
02:46:16,970 --> 02:46:18,830
Battles may be won by the better soldier.

3970
02:46:19,250 --> 02:46:21,050
Wars are won by those who are worse.

3971
02:46:21,070 --> 02:46:23,930
I'm willing to sacrifice everything to ensure victory.

3972
02:46:24,130 --> 02:46:25,310
Yeah, they attacked me first.

3973
02:46:25,470 --> 02:46:26,190
It's self-defense.

3974
02:46:27,810 --> 02:46:28,550
What's this?

3975
02:46:29,670 --> 02:46:30,390
Touch it.

3976
02:46:30,510 --> 02:46:31,930
We don't know what it is, so touch it.

3977
02:46:32,690 --> 02:46:33,590
Oh nice!

3978
02:46:34,810 --> 02:46:36,250
Having lasting benefits.

3979
02:46:36,470 --> 02:46:36,630
Oh!

3980
02:46:36,930 --> 02:46:37,490
Epic!

3981
02:46:40,970 --> 02:46:43,570
Uh... cooldown permanently increases by two.

3982
02:46:44,010 --> 02:46:44,570
Nice.

3983
02:46:44,790 --> 02:46:45,390
Did we eat it?

3984
02:46:46,330 --> 02:46:46,890
Yoink.

3985
02:46:51,380 --> 02:46:53,780
Like, how could the light elves be bad?

3986
02:46:54,120 --> 02:46:56,000
They don't even attack.

3987
02:46:56,880 --> 02:46:59,200
They literally can't even fight back.

3988
02:47:01,840 --> 02:47:03,220
Alright, let's see.

3989
02:47:03,320 --> 02:47:03,720
Is there anything?

3990
02:47:05,260 --> 02:47:06,040
Oh, hey there.

3991
02:47:12,200 --> 02:47:12,520
Alright.

3992
02:47:12,520 --> 02:47:13,840
Do I have any upgrades?

3993
02:47:14,340 --> 02:47:19,320
There's an abandoned temple in Midgard that a fellow dwarf converted to his personal storage.

3994
02:47:19,320 --> 02:47:20,000
Oh, in Midgard?

3995
02:47:20,260 --> 02:47:20,300
At Earth!

3996
02:47:20,300 --> 02:47:23,780
Packed it with all sorts of treasures he collected during his travels throughout the realms.

3997
02:47:24,020 --> 02:47:24,620
Throughout the realms?

3998
02:47:25,200 --> 02:47:26,340
Which ones did he go to?

3999
02:47:26,600 --> 02:47:27,540
What did he collect?

4000
02:47:28,200 --> 02:47:32,460
Fafnir was a, shall we say, aggressive collector of magical artifacts.

4001
02:47:32,880 --> 02:47:34,980
The more he acquired, the more he desired.

4002
02:47:35,460 --> 02:47:38,520
There was no realm too dangerous, no relic too hazardous.

4003
02:47:38,980 --> 02:47:43,000
He once ventured deep into Niflheim for a whetstone of all things.

4004
02:47:43,360 --> 02:47:43,740
Huh.

4005
02:47:44,200 --> 02:47:45,800
I bet that was quite the whetstone.

4006
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:48,500
I guess I was like, the light elves are like super racist.

4007
02:47:48,500 --> 02:47:49,880
I told you guys.

4008
02:47:49,900 --> 02:47:50,980
You guys judge my prejudice.

4009
02:47:51,320 --> 02:47:52,220
But I...

4010
02:47:54,240 --> 02:47:58,340
If I was racist towards the elves first, they can't be racist to me.

4011
02:48:05,420 --> 02:48:07,940
Alright, we gotta find that.

4012
02:48:08,100 --> 02:48:08,460
Okay.

4013
02:48:09,720 --> 02:48:10,540
Let's see.

4014
02:48:15,800 --> 02:48:17,880
You have some lost items?

4015
02:48:18,500 --> 02:48:19,560
That you left behind.

4016
02:48:19,740 --> 02:48:21,120
Select the lost items.

4017
02:48:21,440 --> 02:48:21,680
Oh!

4018
02:48:22,600 --> 02:48:23,480
I'll claim it.

4019
02:48:23,620 --> 02:48:23,840
Yeah!

4020
02:48:24,560 --> 02:48:25,080
Sorry.

4021
02:48:25,400 --> 02:48:25,920
No.

4022
02:48:26,080 --> 02:48:27,160
No need to be sorry.

4023
02:48:27,360 --> 02:48:27,560
Let's see.

4024
02:48:27,660 --> 02:48:28,600
Can I upgrade my axe?

4025
02:48:28,860 --> 02:48:30,780
Oh, I should upgrade your... Oh...

4026
02:48:30,780 --> 02:48:32,640
We don't have any of that.

4027
02:48:32,760 --> 02:48:33,100
Oh!

4028
02:48:33,420 --> 02:48:35,880
Alright, let's reduce your recharge time.

4029
02:48:39,630 --> 02:48:40,490
Let's see.

4030
02:48:46,420 --> 02:48:48,320
Do I have this equipped yet?

4031
02:48:48,360 --> 02:48:48,540
No.

4032
02:48:48,720 --> 02:48:49,020
Okay.

4033
02:48:49,660 --> 02:48:50,560
Let's see.

4034
02:48:50,680 --> 02:48:51,860
We start around...

4035
02:48:51,860 --> 02:48:52,080
Let's see.

4036
02:48:52,080 --> 02:48:52,080
We start around...

4037
02:48:52,080 --> 02:48:52,540
Oh, I'm poor.

4038
02:48:53,820 --> 02:48:56,420
I don't have... I can't afford anything.

4039
02:48:57,960 --> 02:49:00,120
I'm so poor right now.

4040
02:49:01,740 --> 02:49:02,440
Wait.

4041
02:49:02,440 --> 02:49:03,960
Was that 25k?

4042
02:49:04,160 --> 02:49:05,400
Holy shit!

4043
02:49:05,460 --> 02:49:06,900
That was 25k!

4044
02:49:07,320 --> 02:49:10,080
Boy, you better fucking clutch this for me.

4045
02:49:12,600 --> 02:49:14,580
I doesn't need... I...

4046
02:49:14,580 --> 02:49:16,480
You guys know I don't read.

4047
02:49:18,910 --> 02:49:19,260
Oh!

4048
02:49:20,140 --> 02:49:21,560
That's 4 damage...

4049
02:49:21,560 --> 02:49:22,520
Oh, I already upgraded it.

4050
02:49:22,640 --> 02:49:22,860
Okay.

4051
02:49:24,480 --> 02:49:24,940
Oh!

4052
02:49:25,620 --> 02:49:26,860
That's 3 damage!

4053
02:49:27,640 --> 02:49:28,100
Okay.

4054
02:49:28,380 --> 02:49:30,560
Hold L1 and R2.

4055
02:49:31,180 --> 02:49:32,060
What does this do?

4056
02:49:32,220 --> 02:49:33,920
Unlocks an additional fallout attack.

4057
02:49:34,080 --> 02:49:35,280
Okay, I think I'm gonna do this.

4058
02:49:37,260 --> 02:49:38,180
And then...

4059
02:49:38,180 --> 02:49:38,740
Alright.

4060
02:49:38,940 --> 02:49:40,080
That should be good.

4061
02:49:41,340 --> 02:49:42,940
Oh, that's just cosmetics.

4062
02:49:43,340 --> 02:49:44,660
Oh, and then you'll have wolf power.

4063
02:49:45,360 --> 02:49:46,260
I like that.

4064
02:49:47,900 --> 02:49:49,160
I like wolf power.

4065
02:49:49,880 --> 02:49:50,960
Do I have like...

4066
02:49:52,200 --> 02:49:53,000
Minus 11?

4067
02:49:53,380 --> 02:49:53,680
Ew.

4068
02:49:55,680 --> 02:49:57,060
Do I have anything better?

4069
02:49:58,480 --> 02:49:59,360
Minus 8?

4070
02:50:02,140 --> 02:50:05,320
But then I do have plus 12 runic.

4071
02:50:06,120 --> 02:50:06,700
Uh...

4072
02:50:11,120 --> 02:50:12,580
You know what?

4073
02:50:12,900 --> 02:50:13,480
Bye.

4074
02:50:14,360 --> 02:50:15,480
I'll try it.

4075
02:50:15,580 --> 02:50:16,580
I'll try it out.

4076
02:50:16,680 --> 02:50:17,780
It's level 2 anyway.

4077
02:50:17,780 --> 02:50:19,340
Oh, wait!

4078
02:50:19,380 --> 02:50:20,300
It is level 2!

4079
02:50:20,820 --> 02:50:21,380
Okay.

4080
02:50:22,960 --> 02:50:24,960
Oh, but I get rid of a rune.

4081
02:50:25,240 --> 02:50:26,080
That's bad.

4082
02:50:26,400 --> 02:50:27,160
Oh, well.

4083
02:50:28,260 --> 02:50:28,820
Okay.

4084
02:50:29,220 --> 02:50:29,780
Boy...

4085
02:50:29,780 --> 02:50:31,100
Do you get any...

4086
02:50:31,100 --> 02:50:31,940
Oh, it's just...

4087
02:50:32,640 --> 02:50:33,780
Do you even...

4088
02:50:33,780 --> 02:50:36,820
Enemies choked will take increased damage.

4089
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:37,780
Oh, I like that!

4090
02:50:38,700 --> 02:50:40,180
I like increased damage.

4091
02:50:41,080 --> 02:50:42,340
Okay, can I afford anything?

4092
02:50:44,580 --> 02:50:45,140
Uh...

4093
02:50:45,880 --> 02:50:47,020
Purchase, purchase, purchase.

4094
02:50:47,020 --> 02:50:48,380
Oh, you're fully upgraded.

4095
02:50:49,040 --> 02:50:52,300
Okay, I guess I should grab some stuff too.

4096
02:50:53,200 --> 02:50:55,900
Perform attacks without sustaining inflict...

4097
02:50:55,900 --> 02:50:56,000
Oh!

4098
02:50:56,220 --> 02:50:56,940
I like that.

4099
02:50:57,780 --> 02:50:59,440
Okay, that's a good upgrade.

4100
02:50:59,940 --> 02:51:01,720
Faye, our boy is a furry now.

4101
02:51:01,840 --> 02:51:03,100
I accept him now!

4102
02:51:05,770 --> 02:51:08,000
You don't understand, Faye.

4103
02:51:08,120 --> 02:51:09,920
He can summon wolves!

4104
02:51:10,280 --> 02:51:12,180
You don't understand!

4105
02:51:12,960 --> 02:51:16,340
He has wolf power, Faye!

4106
02:51:17,120 --> 02:51:19,120
Thank you for the super chat.

4107
02:51:19,220 --> 02:51:20,260
Thank you, thank you.

4108
02:51:20,960 --> 02:51:21,840
I understand.

4109
02:51:22,180 --> 02:51:23,140
How is he evil?

4110
02:51:25,080 --> 02:51:26,940
How are they the evil ones?

4111
02:51:27,240 --> 02:51:29,220
They don't even self-defend themselves.

4112
02:51:30,060 --> 02:51:31,840
They're, like, weak as fuck.

4113
02:51:33,560 --> 02:51:35,680
Like, I don't see dead fucking...

4114
02:51:35,680 --> 02:51:37,360
I don't see dead dark elves.

4115
02:51:38,240 --> 02:51:40,520
All I see is dead light elves.

4116
02:51:44,060 --> 02:51:44,880
All right.

4117
02:51:45,280 --> 02:51:46,180
Let's see.

4118
02:51:46,220 --> 02:51:47,000
Let's go this way.

4119
02:51:49,280 --> 02:51:52,280
Magic's dumb, but wolf magic, that's different, chat.

4120
02:51:53,120 --> 02:51:54,840
Wolf magic is different.

4121
02:51:55,120 --> 02:51:56,200
Father, I have a confession to make.

4122
02:51:56,280 --> 02:51:56,800
Oh, no.

4123
02:51:56,880 --> 02:51:57,320
What is it?

4124
02:51:57,600 --> 02:51:58,340
All those voices in my head.

4125
02:51:58,880 --> 02:51:59,360
Well...

4126
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:00,540
There's more?

4127
02:52:00,900 --> 02:52:01,280
This is my first time.

4128
02:52:01,820 --> 02:52:05,900
Back when we met Brock, his animal warned me about something hiding in the trees.

4129
02:52:06,360 --> 02:52:07,700
That's why she didn't want to cross.

4130
02:52:08,180 --> 02:52:09,220
She told you.

4131
02:52:09,620 --> 02:52:11,920
Well, I could just feel what she was feeling.

4132
02:52:12,140 --> 02:52:13,720
What she was afraid of.

4133
02:52:14,200 --> 02:52:14,680
Hmm.

4134
02:52:15,060 --> 02:52:16,160
It happens again.

4135
02:52:16,160 --> 02:52:17,440
You tell me.

4136
02:52:17,560 --> 02:52:18,080
Understand?

4137
02:52:19,260 --> 02:52:20,680
Oh, I never looted this.

4138
02:52:22,600 --> 02:52:24,200
How is wolf magic different?

4139
02:52:24,380 --> 02:52:25,980
Because they're good boys.

4140
02:52:26,900 --> 02:52:28,120
They're good boys.

4141
02:52:28,540 --> 02:52:29,380
Oh, hey, loot.

4142
02:52:30,100 --> 02:52:31,140
What does it say?

4143
02:52:31,560 --> 02:52:33,760
It's about the eternal war for the light.

4144
02:52:34,440 --> 02:52:36,480
Do you think it'll stop now after what we did?

4145
02:52:37,120 --> 02:52:37,640
Unlikely.

4146
02:52:38,180 --> 02:52:39,540
Oh, so they'll still fight.

4147
02:52:40,420 --> 02:52:40,940
Okay.

4148
02:52:42,660 --> 02:52:43,180
So...

4149
02:52:43,180 --> 02:52:46,140
We gave no impact in this fight.

4150
02:52:46,160 --> 02:52:46,260
We gave no impact in this war.

4151
02:52:46,720 --> 02:52:47,340
Cool.

4152
02:52:49,260 --> 02:52:51,040
Maybe the dark elves were...

4153
02:52:51,040 --> 02:52:53,500
Maybe the dark elves were like...

4154
02:52:53,500 --> 02:52:56,700
Were like servants or slaves or something.

4155
02:52:57,080 --> 02:52:58,700
They like kept them as like...

4156
02:52:58,700 --> 02:52:59,760
Because they saw them as lesser.

4157
02:53:00,200 --> 02:53:01,780
That's why they didn't fight back.

4158
02:53:01,880 --> 02:53:02,840
Because they're like...

4159
02:53:04,280 --> 02:53:05,520
You're beneath...

4160
02:53:05,520 --> 02:53:07,580
I'd rather die than touch you.

4161
02:53:07,960 --> 02:53:09,480
That's so fucked.

4162
02:53:09,820 --> 02:53:10,840
Holy shit.

4163
02:53:11,300 --> 02:53:12,580
Maybe that's why.

4164
02:53:13,100 --> 02:53:14,580
I wish mom were here.

4165
02:53:14,580 --> 02:53:16,340
The light elves were like...

4166
02:53:16,340 --> 02:53:16,820
You know what?

4167
02:53:16,980 --> 02:53:18,340
I'd rather die...

4168
02:53:18,340 --> 02:53:19,620
Than like...

4169
02:53:19,620 --> 02:53:21,340
Than like let you...

4170
02:53:21,340 --> 02:53:22,880
Than let you guys...

4171
02:53:22,880 --> 02:53:24,040
Than fight back.

4172
02:53:25,940 --> 02:53:26,440
Damn.

4173
02:53:27,660 --> 02:53:28,600
Elves are fucked.

4174
02:53:28,780 --> 02:53:29,700
This is why...

4175
02:53:29,700 --> 02:53:33,220
This is exactly why I told you not to practice elf magic, boy.

4176
02:53:34,140 --> 02:53:35,460
Elves are fucked, man.

4177
02:53:38,540 --> 02:53:39,240
All right.

4178
02:53:39,300 --> 02:53:39,800
Let's see.

4179
02:53:40,060 --> 02:53:40,740
Where do we go?

4180
02:53:41,560 --> 02:53:42,520
I guess this way?

4181
02:53:52,670 --> 02:53:53,730
We have the light.

4182
02:53:53,870 --> 02:53:54,610
To Midgard.

4183
02:53:54,810 --> 02:53:55,290
Okay.

4184
02:53:57,930 --> 02:53:58,790
All right.

4185
02:53:58,830 --> 02:53:59,510
Let's see.

4186
02:54:00,290 --> 02:54:01,630
The dwarves were right.

4187
02:54:03,010 --> 02:54:05,890
There was a reason why dwarves hated elves.

4188
02:54:06,290 --> 02:54:07,170
They were right.

4189
02:54:14,100 --> 02:54:14,740
Midgard.

4190
02:54:14,880 --> 02:54:15,400
Okay.

4191
02:54:15,460 --> 02:54:15,600
No.

4192
02:54:15,620 --> 02:54:16,500
That's Elfman.

4193
02:54:16,580 --> 02:54:17,680
That's Yodahem.

4194
02:54:18,060 --> 02:54:19,340
That's Vanahem.

4195
02:54:19,980 --> 02:54:20,620
That's...

4196
02:54:20,620 --> 02:54:21,180
Okay.

4197
02:54:21,280 --> 02:54:22,500
There's so many Hems.

4198
02:54:22,580 --> 02:54:23,680
That's Nif-Hem.

4199
02:54:23,920 --> 02:54:25,060
There's Asgard.

4200
02:54:25,520 --> 02:54:26,160
There's...

4201
02:54:26,160 --> 02:54:26,740
Okay.

4202
02:54:26,820 --> 02:54:27,000
I don't know.

4203
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:27,960
I went the wrong way.

4204
02:54:29,260 --> 02:54:29,700
Wait.

4205
02:54:29,840 --> 02:54:31,500
Where's Midgard's...

4206
02:54:31,500 --> 02:54:32,100
Goddamn.

4207
02:54:32,200 --> 02:54:32,920
Where's Midgard's center?

4208
02:54:33,240 --> 02:54:33,940
I didn't...

4209
02:54:36,280 --> 02:54:40,180
I was like, what are those tiny characters on my right hand side?

4210
02:54:40,520 --> 02:54:41,920
That's not important, right?

4211
02:54:47,200 --> 02:54:48,020
There we go.

4212
02:54:48,020 --> 02:54:48,780
We figured it out.

4213
02:54:49,320 --> 02:54:49,760
Sorry.

4214
02:54:49,860 --> 02:54:50,860
I didn't turn my head.

4215
02:54:50,980 --> 02:54:55,280
I saw like tiny letters and I was like, tiny letters does not mean it's important.

4216
02:54:59,760 --> 02:55:00,400
All right.

4217
02:55:00,960 --> 02:55:01,720
Let's see.

4218
02:55:01,780 --> 02:55:01,820
Okay.

4219
02:55:04,520 --> 02:55:05,440
We did it.

4220
02:55:05,920 --> 02:55:07,220
Where would the light go?

4221
02:55:09,700 --> 02:55:10,180
Uh...

4222
02:55:11,720 --> 02:55:12,200
Here?

4223
02:55:17,520 --> 02:55:20,640
And the God of War said, let there be light.

4224
02:55:26,650 --> 02:55:27,490
Oh, he's back.

4225
02:55:28,550 --> 02:55:31,610
We just came back from another realm and we met your brother.

4226
02:55:32,210 --> 02:55:33,590
Wait, not that order.

4227
02:55:34,750 --> 02:55:35,670
Did you like...

4228
02:55:35,670 --> 02:55:37,770
Did you know that that seed saw put hand to your blade?

4229
02:55:38,710 --> 02:55:39,270
No.

4230
02:55:39,690 --> 02:55:41,390
You do know he lost his talent.

4231
02:55:41,530 --> 02:55:42,050
Wait, what?

4232
02:55:42,430 --> 02:55:44,450
Just up and left him one day.

4233
02:55:45,310 --> 02:55:47,390
Tried taking me down with him.

4234
02:55:49,690 --> 02:55:50,890
Is that why you're...

4235
02:55:50,890 --> 02:55:51,650
He's not blue?

4236
02:55:53,710 --> 02:55:54,870
Quite the opposite.

4237
02:56:02,890 --> 02:56:06,330
You're leaving a blind pig farts up a truffle now and again.

4238
02:56:08,030 --> 02:56:14,150
What if like the else things is like the French Revolution and I basically stopped it?

4239
02:56:17,790 --> 02:56:20,290
Oh no, I stopped the French Revolution.

4240
02:56:21,610 --> 02:56:22,310
It's better.

4241
02:56:26,870 --> 02:56:27,350
Good.

4242
02:56:27,870 --> 02:56:30,130
Now when you're done gawking, I got a favor to ask.

4243
02:56:30,130 --> 02:56:30,770
Oh, there's a mission.

4244
02:56:31,250 --> 02:56:32,130
What is it, dwarf?

4245
02:56:32,750 --> 02:56:34,790
There's this alchemist on Vary.

4246
02:56:34,930 --> 02:56:36,730
Been working out in the Velander mines.

4247
02:56:37,190 --> 02:56:38,830
You haven't heard from him and made him a friend.

4248
02:56:38,830 --> 02:56:41,810
Maybe, I don't know, a hundred winters or so.

4249
02:56:42,490 --> 02:56:45,670
Probably did, but maybe you can find him.

4250
02:56:45,730 --> 02:56:47,030
He's dwarfing like me.

4251
02:56:47,290 --> 02:56:48,990
No guillotine, no French.

4252
02:56:49,090 --> 02:56:50,730
I am the guillotine, that's it.

4253
02:56:52,510 --> 02:56:54,910
But I missed and chopped the wrong head.

4254
02:56:59,460 --> 02:57:03,000
If you find Don Vary, I'll make him whip you up something special.

4255
02:57:03,420 --> 02:57:03,920
Alright.

4256
02:57:03,980 --> 02:57:05,200
He's a century stone here.

4257
02:57:05,240 --> 02:57:06,840
I ought to get you inside those mines.

4258
02:57:08,520 --> 02:57:09,760
Okay, we got a...

4259
02:57:09,760 --> 02:57:10,960
I mean, that's just a choice.

4260
02:57:12,280 --> 02:57:13,480
Alright, let's see.

4261
02:57:13,860 --> 02:57:14,900
God, I'm so poor.

4262
02:57:15,300 --> 02:57:17,500
I should start selling my stuff, actually.

4263
02:57:19,120 --> 02:57:19,600
Uh...

4264
02:57:19,600 --> 02:57:20,100
Where...

4265
02:57:20,100 --> 02:57:22,400
These are things I'm not wearing, right?

4266
02:57:22,620 --> 02:57:24,040
I'm not wearing any of these?

4267
02:57:25,540 --> 02:57:26,280
Can't tell.

4268
02:57:27,860 --> 02:57:28,340
Oh!

4269
02:57:30,620 --> 02:57:32,220
Oh, they have no other use on my journey.

4270
02:57:32,380 --> 02:57:32,640
Okay.

4271
02:57:33,940 --> 02:57:34,800
Sell your toys.

4272
02:57:35,100 --> 02:57:36,020
They have no other use.

4273
02:57:36,080 --> 02:57:36,340
Okay.

4274
02:57:36,580 --> 02:57:37,980
You got what you wanted.

4275
02:57:38,100 --> 02:57:39,740
They have no other use on your journey.

4276
02:57:40,420 --> 02:57:41,660
No other use?

4277
02:57:41,720 --> 02:57:42,940
It has no other use.

4278
02:57:43,120 --> 02:57:43,320
Okay!

4279
02:57:43,580 --> 02:57:44,420
Let me sell them.

4280
02:57:44,960 --> 02:57:45,520
Nice.

4281
02:57:47,060 --> 02:57:49,560
Okay, we gotta sell this and we gotta sell this.

4282
02:57:50,540 --> 02:57:51,100
Okay.

4283
02:57:51,240 --> 02:57:55,380
That means I should have enough to upgrade my stuff?

4284
02:57:59,300 --> 02:57:59,860
Uh...

4285
02:57:59,860 --> 02:58:02,880
Ooh, this one is an ancient heart.

4286
02:58:05,240 --> 02:58:05,800
Mmm...

4287
02:58:06,380 --> 02:58:09,960
I'd rather like save up for the...

4288
02:58:09,960 --> 02:58:11,280
I want to save up.

4289
02:58:11,280 --> 02:58:12,140
I'm gonna save up for this.

4290
02:58:12,360 --> 02:58:15,880
I don't wanna... I don't wanna buy any of this.

4291
02:58:16,340 --> 02:58:17,480
I'm gonna save up.

4292
02:58:22,780 --> 02:58:23,400
Okay.

4293
02:58:24,220 --> 02:58:27,380
Alright, we just need to find... we need to find...

4294
02:58:27,380 --> 02:58:30,000
I'm not struggling anyway.

4295
02:58:30,320 --> 02:58:30,660
Yeah.

4296
02:58:31,460 --> 02:58:33,820
I don't even know what the Ancients are.

4297
02:58:37,640 --> 02:58:39,600
You have better armor?

4298
02:58:39,920 --> 02:58:40,900
I'm not even struggling.

4299
02:58:41,960 --> 02:58:42,760
That's the thing.

4300
02:58:43,040 --> 02:58:44,140
Is it worth it?

4301
02:58:45,120 --> 02:58:46,580
I don't know if it's worth it.

4302
02:58:47,580 --> 02:58:52,680
I feel like I'm not struggling at all so that I don't care about these armors anyway.

4303
02:58:54,660 --> 02:58:55,160
Oh!

4304
02:58:55,300 --> 02:58:56,660
It's the Golems?

4305
02:58:56,920 --> 02:58:57,420
Oh!

4306
02:58:58,560 --> 02:58:59,060
Okay.

4307
02:59:01,500 --> 02:59:03,060
I guess I could get this.

4308
02:59:05,300 --> 02:59:06,280
I'll just buy this.

4309
02:59:10,900 --> 02:59:10,980
Awww.

4310
02:59:14,420 --> 02:59:14,980
Awww!

4311
02:59:19,000 --> 02:59:22,260
And it's not a shirt so like... I love it.

4312
02:59:23,200 --> 02:59:23,760
Don't?

4313
02:59:24,660 --> 02:59:25,220
Okay.

4314
02:59:27,500 --> 02:59:28,380
Let's see.

4315
02:59:28,760 --> 02:59:30,360
What armor am I wearing though?

4316
02:59:30,580 --> 02:59:31,820
Like what am I wearing?

4317
02:59:32,680 --> 02:59:34,180
I just don't wanna wear a shirt.

4318
02:59:38,510 --> 02:59:39,970
I wanna free the nipple.

4319
02:59:41,070 --> 02:59:43,350
I need them to see that I'm buff.

4320
02:59:44,130 --> 02:59:45,470
Like I worked so hard.

4321
02:59:45,610 --> 02:59:46,210
Look at this.

4322
02:59:46,330 --> 02:59:47,370
I worked so... Oh.

4323
02:59:47,710 --> 02:59:49,870
I worked so hard for this body.

4324
02:59:50,370 --> 02:59:52,350
We need to walk across the bridge to the Vanaheim Tower.

4325
02:59:52,990 --> 02:59:54,390
Are we going to the Black Breath?

4326
02:59:54,750 --> 02:59:55,570
Or exploring?

4327
02:59:56,330 --> 02:59:57,110
Your choice.

4328
02:59:57,350 --> 02:59:58,830
We're going straight... straight forward.

4329
02:59:59,310 --> 03:00:01,390
That's what the yellow hand parade is telling us.

4330
03:00:02,210 --> 03:00:03,070
And what's this?

4331
03:00:07,930 --> 03:00:08,410
What?

4332
03:00:08,410 --> 03:00:09,550
I can go higher?

4333
03:00:15,500 --> 03:00:16,380
What's this for?

4334
03:00:17,880 --> 03:00:18,900
What is this?

4335
03:00:19,080 --> 03:00:19,820
Yeah, what is this?

4336
03:00:20,700 --> 03:00:21,620
A horn?

4337
03:00:22,140 --> 03:00:23,340
Can we blow into it?

4338
03:00:23,480 --> 03:00:24,760
Without knowing the outcome?

4339
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:25,360
Yeah!

4340
03:00:25,940 --> 03:00:27,180
I'll usually push every button.

4341
03:00:27,260 --> 03:00:27,700
Pull every lever...

4342
03:00:27,700 --> 03:00:29,020
I literally pushed this button.

4343
03:00:29,340 --> 03:00:29,920
I don't know if we can predict.

4344
03:00:30,340 --> 03:00:30,860
No.

4345
03:00:31,340 --> 03:00:32,720
This is something else.

4346
03:00:33,400 --> 03:00:35,140
We must develop your instincts.

4347
03:00:35,440 --> 03:00:35,800
What is that?

4348
03:00:36,000 --> 03:00:36,520
Wait.

4349
03:00:39,340 --> 03:00:40,600
I knew it.

4350
03:00:40,660 --> 03:00:42,220
We are blowing the horn.

4351
03:00:42,500 --> 03:00:43,020
No.

4352
03:00:43,060 --> 03:00:43,300
This is something else.

4353
03:00:43,300 --> 03:00:45,180
I cannot blow the horn.

4354
03:00:47,140 --> 03:00:49,660
I wanna blow the horn.

4355
03:00:53,240 --> 03:00:54,840
God damn it.

4356
03:00:55,520 --> 03:00:56,480
No fun.

4357
03:00:57,580 --> 03:00:58,860
No fucking fun.

4358
03:01:00,080 --> 03:01:02,100
Only one bird is allowed here.

4359
03:01:09,520 --> 03:01:10,880
Stupid bird.

4360
03:01:16,620 --> 03:01:17,440
Oh, wait.

4361
03:01:17,500 --> 03:01:18,020
There's a...

4362
03:01:19,300 --> 03:01:20,100
There's a guy.

4363
03:01:21,400 --> 03:01:22,700
But there's a bird.

4364
03:01:29,440 --> 03:01:30,840
No, my coffee!

4365
03:01:31,320 --> 03:01:32,740
No, you guys don't understand.

4366
03:01:34,520 --> 03:01:36,240
That bird was more important.

4367
03:01:37,380 --> 03:01:39,260
You guys don't understand.

4368
03:01:41,080 --> 03:01:41,640
Alright.

4369
03:01:41,680 --> 03:01:43,000
It's time to beat that guy up.

4370
03:01:43,640 --> 03:01:44,780
That's fucking right.

4371
03:01:45,700 --> 03:01:48,200
You thought I don't block?

4372
03:01:49,940 --> 03:01:55,560
After learning about my son and his passion, I too have learned some new moves.

4373
03:01:58,340 --> 03:01:59,340
Told you.

4374
03:01:59,760 --> 03:02:02,480
Even God of Wars can learn new things.

4375
03:02:04,540 --> 03:02:05,140
Nice.

4376
03:02:06,240 --> 03:02:07,260
God damn it.

4377
03:02:07,280 --> 03:02:07,880
When have you...

4378
03:02:07,880 --> 03:02:09,020
When can you read?

4379
03:02:10,540 --> 03:02:11,140
Okay.

4380
03:02:11,560 --> 03:02:12,500
I'll get this.

4381
03:02:12,720 --> 03:02:12,980
Okay.

4382
03:02:13,540 --> 03:02:14,060
Alright.

4383
03:02:16,260 --> 03:02:19,200
What's more terrifying than a dragger?

4384
03:02:19,300 --> 03:02:21,920
A dragger that can run at you really fast?

4385
03:02:22,120 --> 03:02:22,720
They were running?

4386
03:02:24,300 --> 03:02:24,820
Okay.

4387
03:02:25,380 --> 03:02:26,940
Well, they died before they can.

4388
03:02:30,080 --> 03:02:32,400
Uh, return to the mountain.

4389
03:02:35,940 --> 03:02:37,680
Where the fuck is the mountain?

4390
03:02:38,160 --> 03:02:38,360
Oh, look.

4391
03:02:38,720 --> 03:02:41,240
The witch's magic is still covering those scorn poles.

4392
03:02:41,460 --> 03:02:42,340
Oh, nice.

4393
03:02:42,660 --> 03:02:43,360
It saves us some time.

4394
03:02:43,360 --> 03:02:45,300
We can just run past everything.

4395
03:02:47,160 --> 03:02:48,620
Emma, thank you for...

4396
03:02:48,620 --> 03:02:49,900
Welcome to the tomato farm.

4397
03:02:49,940 --> 03:02:50,220
Welcome.

4398
03:02:50,300 --> 03:02:50,680
Welcome.

4399
03:02:51,840 --> 03:02:52,340
Oh!

4400
03:02:53,900 --> 03:02:55,340
Does that mean you shoot that now?

4401
03:02:56,080 --> 03:02:56,860
Never mind.

4402
03:02:56,880 --> 03:02:58,440
No, you're still useless in some way.

4403
03:03:00,080 --> 03:03:00,580
Alright.

4404
03:03:00,720 --> 03:03:02,080
I guess we go this way.

4405
03:03:04,960 --> 03:03:05,960
Never mind.

4406
03:03:09,880 --> 03:03:10,380
Alright.

4407
03:03:10,820 --> 03:03:12,040
Down we go.

4408
03:03:12,380 --> 03:03:12,880
Okay.

4409
03:03:12,880 --> 03:03:13,340
Okay.

4410
03:03:13,360 --> 03:03:14,080
Let's go.

4411
03:03:15,200 --> 03:03:16,060
This way.

4412
03:03:16,840 --> 03:03:17,980
Yeah, I need a crystal.

4413
03:03:19,120 --> 03:03:20,460
There's no crystal here.

4414
03:03:22,740 --> 03:03:23,300
Okay.

4415
03:03:25,040 --> 03:03:26,140
I hear a crow.

4416
03:03:28,680 --> 03:03:29,940
I know you're here.

4417
03:03:30,800 --> 03:03:32,400
I fucking know you're here.

4418
03:03:32,460 --> 03:03:33,200
I heard you.

4419
03:03:33,800 --> 03:03:35,200
I heard the drone.

4420
03:03:35,560 --> 03:03:37,900
There's a fine line between ambition and greed, you know.

4421
03:03:38,040 --> 03:03:39,380
Where the fuck is the drone?

4422
03:03:40,240 --> 03:03:41,640
I know you're here.

4423
03:03:42,220 --> 03:03:43,340
You can't find me!

4424
03:03:47,060 --> 03:03:50,580
I thought you can summon wolves!

4425
03:03:50,880 --> 03:03:51,540
Where are the wolves!

4426
03:03:53,540 --> 03:03:55,860
I gave you wolf power!

4427
03:03:57,140 --> 03:03:58,200
Oh shit!

4428
03:04:02,220 --> 03:04:06,060
What's the point of giving you wolf power if you don't even use it?

4429
03:04:06,120 --> 03:04:08,440
If I had wolf power, I would spam that every day.

4430
03:04:08,440 --> 03:04:14,500
Alright, I have to hold down the boy button?!

4431
03:04:14,500 --> 03:04:16,020
Fucking boy!

4432
03:04:16,400 --> 03:04:18,880
Alright, where's the crow?

4433
03:04:19,880 --> 03:04:21,140
Where's the drone?

4434
03:04:22,080 --> 03:04:23,680
Where's the government drone?

4435
03:04:26,500 --> 03:04:28,040
The fuck is it?

4436
03:04:28,760 --> 03:04:30,440
I heard you!

4437
03:04:33,160 --> 03:04:34,320
Is that it?

4438
03:04:34,600 --> 03:04:36,720
No, that's just a regular bird.

4439
03:04:40,000 --> 03:04:41,400
I know you're alive.

4440
03:04:45,060 --> 03:04:47,340
Where's this magic coming from?

4441
03:04:48,800 --> 03:04:49,360
What?

4442
03:04:52,780 --> 03:04:56,080
Okay, there is magic here, but I don't know where it is.

4443
03:04:58,520 --> 03:05:00,560
Where the fuck is the magic?!

4444
03:05:05,060 --> 03:05:05,960
You're over here!

4445
03:05:06,120 --> 03:05:07,480
I know you're over here!

4446
03:05:07,920 --> 03:05:09,520
No, that's just a regular crow!

4447
03:05:11,100 --> 03:05:12,120
God damn it!

4448
03:05:15,160 --> 03:05:16,260
Wait, what's that?

4449
03:05:18,820 --> 03:05:20,620
What the fuck is that?

4450
03:05:22,680 --> 03:05:23,380
Wait, oh!

4451
03:05:25,920 --> 03:05:26,840
Oh shit!

4452
03:05:27,340 --> 03:05:28,720
Oh shit!

4453
03:05:30,160 --> 03:05:31,580
Okay, that's badass!

4454
03:05:32,940 --> 03:05:34,840
That's actually badass, not gonna lie.

4455
03:05:37,920 --> 03:05:39,180
God damn it, boy.

4456
03:05:40,340 --> 03:05:41,220
Wait, then how?

4457
03:05:41,360 --> 03:05:42,360
What happened to that?

4458
03:05:44,260 --> 03:05:45,520
Does it die to poison?

4459
03:05:46,780 --> 03:05:47,680
Is it dying?

4460
03:05:47,860 --> 03:05:48,480
No, it's not.

4461
03:05:50,100 --> 03:05:51,420
Use your magic woes!

4462
03:05:54,280 --> 03:05:56,800
What's the point if you can't use your magic woes?

4463
03:05:58,860 --> 03:05:59,640
Oh shit!

4464
03:06:00,300 --> 03:06:00,760
Oops.

4465
03:06:01,600 --> 03:06:02,740
I walked into it.

4466
03:06:02,860 --> 03:06:04,060
That was on me, guys.

4467
03:06:07,380 --> 03:06:09,240
Okay, that was badass, though.

4468
03:06:09,260 --> 03:06:10,060
The magic woes.

4469
03:06:10,820 --> 03:06:12,320
That shit looks so cool.

4470
03:06:13,820 --> 03:06:14,680
I gave up.

4471
03:06:14,700 --> 03:06:16,260
I don't know where the fuck the crow is.

4472
03:06:17,480 --> 03:06:20,180
I guess Odin can have a little peep show.

4473
03:06:24,480 --> 03:06:25,540
I've given up.

4474
03:06:26,020 --> 03:06:28,060
It's very easy for me to give up.

4475
03:06:31,370 --> 03:06:33,730
Where the fuck is the thing?

4476
03:06:34,730 --> 03:06:35,250
Okay.

4477
03:06:36,070 --> 03:06:36,590
Okay.

4478
03:06:38,490 --> 03:06:39,010
Okay.

4479
03:06:39,730 --> 03:06:39,750
Okay.

4480
03:06:39,750 --> 03:06:39,770
I don't know.

4481
03:06:41,410 --> 03:06:41,810
Okay.

4482
03:06:42,610 --> 03:06:43,010
Awe.

4483
03:06:46,090 --> 03:06:48,590
Wait, where did Boy- Wait, wait, where is he?

4484
03:06:48,870 --> 03:06:49,270
Okay.

4485
03:06:51,450 --> 03:06:52,470
Oh, there you are!

4486
03:06:53,130 --> 03:06:55,070
I was like, where did he go?

4487
03:06:57,450 --> 03:07:00,110
Wait, where did he go?

4488
03:07:00,110 --> 03:07:01,330
Where did he go?

4489
03:07:01,870 --> 03:07:02,610
Where did he go?

4490
03:07:02,690 --> 03:07:05,990
So, who do you think carved the face in the mountain?

4491
03:07:06,350 --> 03:07:07,730
You would know better than I.

4492
03:07:16,170 --> 03:07:16,650
Oh?

4493
03:07:16,650 --> 03:07:17,610
What's that sound?

4494
03:07:20,710 --> 03:07:22,390
Okay, I can't burn that yet.

4495
03:07:24,170 --> 03:07:26,330
I don't have fire powers, apparently.

4496
03:07:27,570 --> 03:07:28,770
Alright, off we go!

4497
03:07:31,070 --> 03:07:32,530
We're off to see the witch.

4498
03:07:35,150 --> 03:07:36,770
We're off to see the wizard.

4499
03:07:36,770 --> 03:07:38,370
The wonderful wizard of Oz.

4500
03:07:39,690 --> 03:07:42,670
And God of War said, let there be light!

4501
03:07:44,530 --> 03:07:45,270
Be gone!

4502
03:07:47,770 --> 03:07:49,130
Okay, but what if...

4503
03:07:50,010 --> 03:07:52,170
What happens if we go into the darkness?

4504
03:07:54,770 --> 03:07:55,770
What happens?

4505
03:07:58,130 --> 03:08:01,410
What if I want to go into the darkness?

4506
03:08:03,550 --> 03:08:05,690
I want to let the darkness into my heart.

4507
03:08:07,530 --> 03:08:09,430
You become Kingdom Hearts.

4508
03:08:11,330 --> 03:08:13,230
Jesus Christ, this is so loud.

4509
03:08:13,290 --> 03:08:14,450
What the fuck is that?

4510
03:08:14,890 --> 03:08:17,110
Is that also something that's related?

4511
03:08:17,970 --> 03:08:19,650
The vibrating crystals?

4512
03:08:25,150 --> 03:08:25,910
Alright.

4513
03:08:28,010 --> 03:08:29,150
Off we go!

4514
03:08:33,620 --> 03:08:34,380
Jesus!

4515
03:08:34,760 --> 03:08:35,960
Why can't I run?

4516
03:08:37,840 --> 03:08:38,600
Woo!

4517
03:08:43,170 --> 03:08:44,830
The light of...

4518
03:08:44,830 --> 03:08:45,350
Then we climb.

4519
03:08:46,010 --> 03:08:46,610
Aphelim...

4520
03:08:46,610 --> 03:08:47,110
Aphem.

4521
03:08:48,430 --> 03:08:49,030
Okay.

4522
03:08:49,350 --> 03:08:50,730
We gotta climb here.

4523
03:08:51,910 --> 03:08:52,510
Wait.

4524
03:08:54,710 --> 03:08:55,730
I hear it.

4525
03:08:57,510 --> 03:08:58,750
I hear you.

4526
03:09:01,330 --> 03:09:03,030
No, I'm not going crazy.

4527
03:09:03,090 --> 03:09:04,150
I know you exist!

4528
03:09:04,990 --> 03:09:06,910
I know you fucking exist!

4529
03:09:09,130 --> 03:09:10,470
I heard you.

4530
03:09:12,050 --> 03:09:13,410
It's not voices.

4531
03:09:13,450 --> 03:09:14,950
I know you're real.

4532
03:09:17,330 --> 03:09:18,390
God damn it.

4533
03:09:18,390 --> 03:09:19,390
Where the fuck are you?

4534
03:09:19,490 --> 03:09:20,750
I know you're real.

4535
03:09:23,530 --> 03:09:25,890
I know you're spying on me.

4536
03:09:29,330 --> 03:09:30,430
I hear him.

4537
03:09:30,730 --> 03:09:32,010
He's like right here.

4538
03:09:33,670 --> 03:09:34,390
He's above me.

4539
03:09:34,570 --> 03:09:34,790
You know...

4540
03:09:34,790 --> 03:09:38,270
All they said the giants used to visit the Midgard Mountains before they disappeared.

4541
03:09:38,270 --> 03:09:38,790
I know you're here.

4542
03:09:38,990 --> 03:09:40,030
Where are you?

4543
03:09:40,390 --> 03:09:40,470
Yeah.

4544
03:09:40,630 --> 03:09:42,510
But that's just a normal crow!

4545
03:09:43,570 --> 03:09:45,190
Perhaps they returned to their home.

4546
03:09:45,270 --> 03:09:46,730
There's normal crows?

4547
03:09:46,970 --> 03:09:47,170
Maybe.

4548
03:09:47,410 --> 03:09:48,350
I wonder if the...

4549
03:09:48,350 --> 03:09:48,750
No.

4550
03:09:48,750 --> 03:09:49,670
No, that's not true.

4551
03:09:50,330 --> 03:09:51,270
Crows aren't real.

4552
03:09:51,430 --> 03:09:52,850
They were invented by the government.

4553
03:09:53,830 --> 03:09:56,010
Why else are there so many of them?

4554
03:09:58,710 --> 03:09:59,750
No, that can't be.

4555
03:10:03,820 --> 03:10:04,960
More black breath.

4556
03:10:05,740 --> 03:10:06,200
Alright.

4557
03:10:06,920 --> 03:10:07,960
It's going to be light.

4558
03:10:08,960 --> 03:10:10,020
Where do I go?

4559
03:10:11,120 --> 03:10:12,460
I guess I follow?

4560
03:10:15,260 --> 03:10:16,760
I guess I go this way?

4561
03:10:18,460 --> 03:10:20,220
Oh, there's a skull down there.

4562
03:10:21,200 --> 03:10:21,720
Phew!

4563
03:10:25,920 --> 03:10:26,440
Okay.

4564
03:10:30,960 --> 03:10:32,780
There must be something over here, right?

4565
03:10:33,600 --> 03:10:34,120
Yeah.

4566
03:10:34,940 --> 03:10:35,720
Oh, shit!

4567
03:10:35,720 --> 03:10:36,680
Wait, there is.

4568
03:10:37,620 --> 03:10:38,220
Oh!

4569
03:10:38,460 --> 03:10:39,300
Nice loot.

4570
03:10:43,080 --> 03:10:43,680
Alright.

4571
03:10:48,120 --> 03:10:49,160
Down I go.

4572
03:10:50,700 --> 03:10:52,160
Down, down, down, down.

4573
03:10:54,520 --> 03:10:55,120
Okay.

4574
03:10:55,620 --> 03:10:56,220
Nice.

4575
03:10:57,100 --> 03:10:57,700
Alright.

4576
03:10:59,500 --> 03:11:01,340
Still can't open that yet.

4577
03:11:03,080 --> 03:11:03,680
Oh!

4578
03:11:03,820 --> 03:11:04,560
Wait, no.

4579
03:11:04,560 --> 03:11:05,320
That's like...

4580
03:11:05,320 --> 03:11:07,500
This is exactly like getting over it.

4581
03:11:07,520 --> 03:11:08,420
It almost baited me.

4582
03:11:08,800 --> 03:11:09,320
It...

4583
03:11:12,180 --> 03:11:15,640
It's like snakes and ladder where that snake takes you all the way down.

4584
03:11:17,400 --> 03:11:19,960
Don't go down the rope.

4585
03:11:20,860 --> 03:11:22,940
It's just like snakes and ladders.

4586
03:11:25,280 --> 03:11:25,580
Okay.

4587
03:11:28,360 --> 03:11:30,140
I guess we go this way.

4588
03:11:31,380 --> 03:11:32,500
Open the door!

4589
03:11:34,820 --> 03:11:35,380
Weeow!

4590
03:11:36,660 --> 03:11:37,220
Alright.

4591
03:11:39,400 --> 03:11:40,680
Wait, is that a deer?

4592
03:11:42,460 --> 03:11:43,020
Woah!

4593
03:11:43,720 --> 03:11:45,080
Wait, what kind of god is that?

4594
03:11:48,440 --> 03:11:50,440
What kind of god is that?

4595
03:11:50,900 --> 03:11:51,180
Woah!

4596
03:11:52,040 --> 03:11:53,700
What the fuck?!

4597
03:11:53,700 --> 03:11:55,560
What the fuck are you?

4598
03:11:56,900 --> 03:11:57,180
Okay.

4599
03:11:59,400 --> 03:12:01,100
That scared the shit out of me.

4600
03:12:01,200 --> 03:12:01,780
What the fuck?

4601
03:12:02,220 --> 03:12:03,400
Came out of nowhere.

4602
03:12:04,640 --> 03:12:05,800
That's fucking right.

4603
03:12:05,840 --> 03:12:06,860
You can't do jack shit.

4604
03:12:09,100 --> 03:12:10,180
Is there loot here?

4605
03:12:10,380 --> 03:12:11,180
No loot.

4606
03:12:12,820 --> 03:12:15,160
More stuff I can't do yet.

4607
03:12:15,600 --> 03:12:16,480
Fucking trees.

4608
03:12:16,580 --> 03:12:17,640
It's always the trees.

4609
03:12:21,300 --> 03:12:23,100
Always the goddamn trees.

4610
03:12:23,700 --> 03:12:24,480
Oh hey, loot.

4611
03:12:25,560 --> 03:12:26,120
Nice.

4612
03:12:27,740 --> 03:12:30,080
Got more money.

4613
03:12:31,120 --> 03:12:31,600
Money.

4614
03:12:34,040 --> 03:12:36,440
Wanted to beat up that box.

4615
03:12:37,140 --> 03:12:38,100
Breathe.

4616
03:12:44,860 --> 03:12:45,640
What's that mean?

4617
03:12:47,000 --> 03:12:47,760
Boy explain.

4618
03:12:52,660 --> 03:12:54,880
A second light crystal?

4619
03:12:57,040 --> 03:12:58,000
Two?

4620
03:12:59,780 --> 03:13:01,180
Oh!

4621
03:13:05,050 --> 03:13:05,750
Okay.

4622
03:13:09,120 --> 03:13:10,540
What am I supposed to do?

4623
03:13:17,620 --> 03:13:19,020
What?

4624
03:13:25,100 --> 03:13:25,800
What?

4625
03:13:31,700 --> 03:13:32,400
What?

4626
03:13:34,000 --> 03:13:34,700
What?

4627
03:13:44,950 --> 03:13:45,650
What?

4628
03:13:45,930 --> 03:13:47,330
What?

4629
03:13:47,550 --> 03:13:48,950
What?

4630
03:13:59,810 --> 03:14:01,210
Whatever.

4631
03:14:02,970 --> 03:14:05,110
Yeah, me too.

4632
03:14:05,330 --> 03:14:05,710
What?

4633
03:14:07,990 --> 03:14:09,350
Yeah, me too.

4634
03:14:09,350 --> 03:14:09,570
Yeah.

4635
03:14:09,730 --> 03:14:13,490
What's happening?

4636
03:14:19,520 --> 03:14:20,400
Okay.

4637
03:14:24,030 --> 03:14:24,910
Okay.

4638
03:14:26,210 --> 03:14:28,490
Is there another crystal?

4639
03:14:44,640 --> 03:14:45,840
Is there?

4640
03:14:46,640 --> 03:14:48,420
It's a box.

4641
03:14:48,860 --> 03:14:48,920
A box.

4642
03:14:54,740 --> 03:14:55,620
Huh?

4643
03:14:55,880 --> 03:14:56,560
Are you serious?

4644
03:15:00,300 --> 03:15:01,080
Oh, hey!

4645
03:15:03,500 --> 03:15:04,460
There it is!

4646
03:15:04,900 --> 03:15:05,900
Did I hit it?

4647
03:15:08,540 --> 03:15:10,000
What the fuck did I do?

4648
03:15:15,710 --> 03:15:17,030
I think I hit it.

4649
03:15:21,570 --> 03:15:22,370
It's glowing.

4650
03:15:25,230 --> 03:15:26,070
Is it glowing?

4651
03:15:28,050 --> 03:15:29,310
I think it's glowing.

4652
03:15:29,570 --> 03:15:29,950
Yeah.

4653
03:15:34,310 --> 03:15:35,330
Yeah, it's glowing.

4654
03:15:36,070 --> 03:15:36,990
I did it.

4655
03:15:44,860 --> 03:15:45,460
Huh?

4656
03:15:45,460 --> 03:15:46,060
Oh!

4657
03:15:48,160 --> 03:15:50,000
Wait, there's a crystal there too!

4658
03:15:51,100 --> 03:15:51,700
Huh?

4659
03:15:52,460 --> 03:15:55,960
How the fuck do I get to the other side?

4660
03:16:01,560 --> 03:16:02,160
No!

4661
03:16:02,300 --> 03:16:03,840
Believe in me!

4662
03:16:08,990 --> 03:16:10,530
There must be a way.

4663
03:16:14,230 --> 03:16:16,610
Go back and look up?

4664
03:16:18,150 --> 03:16:25,070
Oh my... Guys, if this was yellow, I would've figured it out.

4665
03:16:27,530 --> 03:16:31,870
All I'm saying is that if they... It's because it's blue!

4666
03:16:32,590 --> 03:16:34,170
And it threw me off!

4667
03:16:36,910 --> 03:16:38,250
It threw me off!

4668
03:16:38,390 --> 03:16:39,050
It was blue!

4669
03:16:40,130 --> 03:16:42,150
Who the fuck makes that shit blue?

4670
03:16:44,350 --> 03:16:46,150
Why can't it be yellow crystals?

4671
03:16:48,150 --> 03:16:50,430
If it was yellow crystal, I would've figured it out.

4672
03:16:56,040 --> 03:16:56,600
Alright.

4673
03:16:58,700 --> 03:16:59,260
Freedom?

4674
03:17:11,310 --> 03:17:12,150
What's it doing?

4675
03:17:17,470 --> 03:17:18,030
Huh?

4676
03:17:22,190 --> 03:17:23,010
What class?

4677
03:17:26,390 --> 03:17:27,870
Oh, I can climb now!

4678
03:17:29,630 --> 03:17:30,670
Oh, it's a door.

4679
03:17:34,770 --> 03:17:36,070
Nevermind, it's a door.

4680
03:17:37,150 --> 03:17:38,490
Yes, light the crystal.

4681
03:17:39,390 --> 03:17:41,230
Use the magic that you learned.

4682
03:17:42,650 --> 03:17:43,890
Okay, I don't trust these.

4683
03:17:45,630 --> 03:17:46,790
Never trust them.

4684
03:17:48,130 --> 03:17:49,090
Down is up!

4685
03:17:52,310 --> 03:17:53,550
Down is up!

4686
03:17:55,610 --> 03:17:56,830
I am always serious.

4687
03:17:57,430 --> 03:17:57,870
Okay.

4688
03:17:58,510 --> 03:18:00,870
Mama always said you never took an interest in history.

4689
03:18:01,530 --> 03:18:04,170
Giants are just a race, like elves and hold your phone.

4690
03:18:04,630 --> 03:18:05,890
It doesn't mean they're big.

4691
03:18:06,210 --> 03:18:07,630
What are the worlds of it?

4692
03:18:08,090 --> 03:18:10,610
Okay, in that case, giant also means big.

4693
03:18:10,810 --> 03:18:12,170
But there's only one of them.

4694
03:18:13,830 --> 03:18:14,670
Wait, what's that?

4695
03:18:16,230 --> 03:18:17,590
Doesn't matter, there's a vase.

4696
03:18:19,290 --> 03:18:19,730
Arteus.

4697
03:18:20,670 --> 03:18:22,230
Let's see how far you can shoot.

4698
03:18:23,010 --> 03:18:24,050
Did you hit it?

4699
03:18:26,290 --> 03:18:28,130
Okay, clearly not far enough.

4700
03:18:29,370 --> 03:18:30,790
Alright, up we go.

4701
03:18:34,650 --> 03:18:35,450
Oh shit.

4702
03:18:36,550 --> 03:18:37,850
Oh shit, that's a lot!

4703
03:18:39,870 --> 03:18:40,350
Okay.

4704
03:18:40,450 --> 03:18:42,050
Wait, where the fuck did my axe go?

4705
03:18:44,390 --> 03:18:46,990
Wait, I need to get rid of the mini guys first.

4706
03:18:48,870 --> 03:18:49,830
Alright, now...

4707
03:18:49,830 --> 03:18:50,890
Now I'm...

4708
03:18:50,890 --> 03:18:51,410
Oh shit!

4709
03:18:51,470 --> 03:18:52,630
Okay, I guess I am serious.

4710
03:18:52,630 --> 03:18:56,130
I did not mean to do that, but I'm serious now.

4711
03:18:57,270 --> 03:18:59,210
That was an accident.

4712
03:19:00,350 --> 03:19:01,810
But I'm serious.

4713
03:19:04,410 --> 03:19:05,450
There you go.

4714
03:19:05,550 --> 03:19:06,650
That's fucking right.

4715
03:19:07,790 --> 03:19:09,750
I don't fucking play around.

4716
03:19:11,390 --> 03:19:12,430
Oh, okay, they're all dead.

4717
03:19:13,390 --> 03:19:13,730
Yay!

4718
03:19:17,540 --> 03:19:18,220
Alright.

4719
03:19:21,680 --> 03:19:22,700
The summoner?

4720
03:19:22,700 --> 03:19:24,640
Oh, they summoned the nightmares!

4721
03:19:24,960 --> 03:19:25,820
I see.

4722
03:19:26,200 --> 03:19:28,000
Oh wait, there's so much loot!

4723
03:19:30,600 --> 03:19:31,540
What's that sound?

4724
03:19:35,300 --> 03:19:36,360
What's that sound?

4725
03:19:37,220 --> 03:19:38,980
I see... I hear a creature.

4726
03:19:39,640 --> 03:19:40,820
That's still alive.

4727
03:19:42,720 --> 03:19:44,220
Okay, I gotta get rid of this.

4728
03:19:45,520 --> 03:19:46,540
What does this do?

4729
03:19:47,000 --> 03:19:48,120
Oh, it's just light.

4730
03:19:49,480 --> 03:19:50,380
Okay, nice.

4731
03:19:51,120 --> 03:19:51,680
Nice.

4732
03:19:55,120 --> 03:19:55,840
Okay.

4733
03:19:56,080 --> 03:19:57,400
I hear you.

4734
03:19:58,240 --> 03:19:59,580
Fucking hear you.

4735
03:20:00,160 --> 03:20:02,500
Don't think you can hide from me.

4736
03:20:03,480 --> 03:20:05,440
Don't think you can hide...

4737
03:20:05,440 --> 03:20:06,080
Oh!

4738
03:20:09,120 --> 03:20:10,560
You thought...

4739
03:20:10,560 --> 03:20:12,520
You thought I couldn't hear you.

4740
03:20:12,680 --> 03:20:13,700
You thought...

4741
03:20:13,700 --> 03:20:15,100
That's fucking right.

4742
03:20:18,400 --> 03:20:20,860
I knew you were here.

4743
03:20:23,300 --> 03:20:24,540
Okay, this way.

4744
03:20:25,020 --> 03:20:25,540
Wait.

4745
03:20:25,700 --> 03:20:26,800
Not this way?

4746
03:20:27,400 --> 03:20:29,040
Where's the chest for this?

4747
03:20:31,720 --> 03:20:33,500
Okay, this is the right way.

4748
03:20:33,880 --> 03:20:35,860
So this is the extra way.

4749
03:20:37,700 --> 03:20:38,220
Okay.

4750
03:20:40,760 --> 03:20:41,860
I'm just gonna...

4751
03:20:43,160 --> 03:20:45,100
I'm just gonna get rid of him real fast.

4752
03:20:46,000 --> 03:20:47,200
Like, I don't wanna deal...

4753
03:20:47,200 --> 03:20:47,400
Oh!

4754
03:20:47,480 --> 03:20:47,760
Wait!

4755
03:20:47,860 --> 03:20:48,680
That's more than one!

4756
03:20:48,880 --> 03:20:49,360
Oh!

4757
03:20:49,660 --> 03:20:49,840
Oh!

4758
03:20:49,840 --> 03:20:50,240
Oh!

4759
03:20:50,380 --> 03:20:51,480
Oh!

4760
03:20:51,480 --> 03:20:52,580
That guy's level four.

4761
03:20:53,080 --> 03:20:53,640
Oh!

4762
03:20:53,800 --> 03:20:55,100
That guy's very strong.

4763
03:20:55,540 --> 03:20:56,100
Oh!

4764
03:20:57,720 --> 03:20:58,420
All right.

4765
03:20:58,720 --> 03:21:00,380
What if I send in the...

4766
03:21:00,380 --> 03:21:02,080
I send in the woes.

4767
03:21:03,400 --> 03:21:04,200
Okay, nice.

4768
03:21:05,800 --> 03:21:06,660
Oh, shit!

4769
03:21:06,880 --> 03:21:07,720
Oh, shit!

4770
03:21:07,760 --> 03:21:08,000
Okay.

4771
03:21:08,280 --> 03:21:09,640
I'm gonna grab my axe back.

4772
03:21:11,280 --> 03:21:11,840
Swing!

4773
03:21:12,420 --> 03:21:12,980
Swing!

4774
03:21:13,100 --> 03:21:14,020
Keep swinging!

4775
03:21:14,460 --> 03:21:15,020
Oh!

4776
03:21:15,820 --> 03:21:16,520
That's okay.

4777
03:21:16,560 --> 03:21:17,020
I parry.

4778
03:21:17,760 --> 03:21:19,040
This is so low!

4779
03:21:19,340 --> 03:21:19,900
Oh!

4780
03:21:20,380 --> 03:21:21,060
He's so low!

4781
03:21:21,360 --> 03:21:21,440
Oh!

4782
03:21:22,400 --> 03:21:22,580
Please!

4783
03:21:22,900 --> 03:21:23,420
Please!

4784
03:21:23,760 --> 03:21:24,160
Boy!

4785
03:21:24,860 --> 03:21:26,380
I fucked up Boy!

4786
03:21:28,460 --> 03:21:29,100
JK.

4787
03:21:29,640 --> 03:21:30,840
I'm a gamer.

4788
03:21:31,000 --> 03:21:32,300
I never fuck up.

4789
03:21:34,400 --> 03:21:35,280
All right.

4790
03:21:35,400 --> 03:21:36,580
Let's see...

4791
03:21:36,580 --> 03:21:38,520
Where the fuck is...

4792
03:21:39,320 --> 03:21:40,380
Where's the chest?

4793
03:21:41,400 --> 03:21:42,840
How do I get over there?

4794
03:21:44,200 --> 03:21:45,080
All right.

4795
03:21:47,200 --> 03:21:49,300
Where the fuck's the chest, though?

4796
03:21:49,560 --> 03:21:50,200
Oh!

4797
03:21:50,220 --> 03:21:50,360
Oh!

4798
03:21:50,380 --> 03:21:51,580
Shoot this!

4799
03:21:53,740 --> 03:21:54,880
Does that do anything?

4800
03:21:55,240 --> 03:21:56,460
Oh, there's the chest!

4801
03:21:59,560 --> 03:22:03,140
Okay, I don't trust these at all.

4802
03:22:06,600 --> 03:22:07,460
It's blue.

4803
03:22:09,140 --> 03:22:09,720
Okay.

4804
03:22:11,200 --> 03:22:12,600
Wait, where's the chest?

4805
03:22:17,220 --> 03:22:20,000
I don't like how I can't find the chest.

4806
03:22:22,540 --> 03:22:24,320
Where the fuck's the chest?

4807
03:22:27,600 --> 03:22:28,760
Okay, this way.

4808
03:22:30,520 --> 03:22:31,160
Oh.

4809
03:22:31,960 --> 03:22:32,920
Oh, shit!

4810
03:22:35,600 --> 03:22:36,800
That's fucking right.

4811
03:22:38,580 --> 03:22:39,420
That's right!

4812
03:22:39,940 --> 03:22:41,860
You can't touch the ground now!

4813
03:22:43,700 --> 03:22:44,340
Yay!

4814
03:22:45,680 --> 03:22:47,320
Where's the chest though?

4815
03:22:47,460 --> 03:22:47,880
Okay.

4816
03:22:47,900 --> 03:22:49,700
This is the right way to go.

4817
03:22:52,380 --> 03:22:53,900
So... okay.

4818
03:22:54,260 --> 03:22:56,040
That lore is not important.

4819
03:22:56,540 --> 03:22:57,980
So, it's this way.

4820
03:23:00,180 --> 03:23:02,280
Oh, there it is!

4821
03:23:02,920 --> 03:23:04,120
Oh, I did it!

4822
03:23:07,340 --> 03:23:09,340
I didn't do it?

4823
03:23:09,780 --> 03:23:10,420
Oh!

4824
03:23:11,240 --> 03:23:13,340
B-N-R.

4825
03:23:13,600 --> 03:23:14,020
Okay.

4826
03:23:16,320 --> 03:23:18,420
B-N-R.

4827
03:23:19,800 --> 03:23:21,280
Alright, that is...

4828
03:23:23,020 --> 03:23:23,940
That's the N.

4829
03:23:24,480 --> 03:23:25,320
Where's the B?

4830
03:23:27,000 --> 03:23:29,100
Oh my god, where are the other letters?

4831
03:23:31,600 --> 03:23:32,160
Okay.

4832
03:23:32,160 --> 03:23:33,000
That's N.

4833
03:23:35,100 --> 03:23:37,440
That is... none of that.

4834
03:23:39,500 --> 03:23:40,620
F-R.

4835
03:23:41,340 --> 03:23:42,480
Where's the last one?

4836
03:23:43,860 --> 03:23:44,820
Oh, there it is!

4837
03:23:46,240 --> 03:23:47,060
That's N.

4838
03:23:48,720 --> 03:23:49,520
Oh no.

4839
03:23:51,100 --> 03:23:51,840
Oh no.

4840
03:23:55,220 --> 03:23:56,160
Did I hit it?

4841
03:23:56,640 --> 03:23:57,800
I'm gonna make it hit.

4842
03:23:58,000 --> 03:23:58,500
Don't worry.

4843
03:24:03,660 --> 03:24:04,660
Oh my god.

4844
03:24:04,740 --> 03:24:05,180
This way.

4845
03:24:12,160 --> 03:24:13,260
Okay, I'll get closer.

4846
03:24:16,300 --> 03:24:20,300
Look, I was lazy, okay?

4847
03:24:21,960 --> 03:24:25,700
I just wanted it to be easy.

4848
03:24:28,580 --> 03:24:30,540
Okay, why is it not hitting?

4849
03:24:30,840 --> 03:24:31,840
Okay, F...

4850
03:24:32,740 --> 03:24:33,460
B.

4851
03:24:33,600 --> 03:24:34,240
There we go.

4852
03:24:34,440 --> 03:24:35,240
That should work.

4853
03:24:39,140 --> 03:24:39,500
Alright.

4854
03:24:41,160 --> 03:24:41,880
Yippee!

4855
03:24:41,880 --> 03:24:42,960
Trust tab!

4856
03:24:44,820 --> 03:24:44,900
Yay!

4857
03:24:47,320 --> 03:24:49,420
I wish I could take everything else in there.

4858
03:24:49,620 --> 03:24:50,720
I clearly needed money.

4859
03:24:51,380 --> 03:24:53,460
So, like, it wouldn't matter.

4860
03:24:54,500 --> 03:24:56,340
Holy shit, that's a big giant.

4861
03:25:00,830 --> 03:25:02,270
Don't trust you.

4862
03:25:03,870 --> 03:25:06,090
I knew I shouldn't have trusted you.

4863
03:25:06,450 --> 03:25:07,030
Oh, loot!

4864
03:25:10,010 --> 03:25:10,770
What's this?

4865
03:25:12,890 --> 03:25:13,490
What?

4866
03:25:15,730 --> 03:25:16,650
Oh shit.

4867
03:25:16,650 --> 03:25:18,350
And you're running back to me?

4868
03:25:20,750 --> 03:25:21,730
Go, Woes!

4869
03:25:21,810 --> 03:25:22,070
Go!

4870
03:25:23,810 --> 03:25:24,830
Go, Woes!

4871
03:25:24,850 --> 03:25:25,130
Go!

4872
03:25:26,390 --> 03:25:28,030
Keep using your magic, Woes!

4873
03:25:29,210 --> 03:25:30,690
Oh my... yeah.

4874
03:25:30,750 --> 03:25:31,750
Yeah, they're not...

4875
03:25:31,750 --> 03:25:34,230
My axe doesn't go that far, guys.

4876
03:25:34,530 --> 03:25:35,090
My...

4877
03:25:37,850 --> 03:25:39,730
I'm just gonna...

4878
03:25:41,690 --> 03:25:43,890
My axe does not go that far.

4879
03:25:44,510 --> 03:25:45,430
Oh, there we go.

4880
03:25:45,790 --> 03:25:46,350
Easy.

4881
03:25:49,190 --> 03:25:49,690
Easy.

4882
03:25:49,690 --> 03:25:49,690
Wait.

4883
03:25:49,810 --> 03:25:51,070
What's the point of being here?

4884
03:25:51,130 --> 03:25:52,210
There was no crystals here!

4885
03:25:54,390 --> 03:25:55,790
How the fuck were they mad?

4886
03:25:56,630 --> 03:25:57,130
Whoa!

4887
03:25:59,070 --> 03:26:00,790
Fuck this guy in particular.

4888
03:26:03,130 --> 03:26:04,570
Look, they're level 4!

4889
03:26:04,810 --> 03:26:05,610
I had to!

4890
03:26:06,690 --> 03:26:07,670
Alright, nice.

4891
03:26:10,730 --> 03:26:12,730
There's, like, no crystals anywhere.

4892
03:26:16,560 --> 03:26:18,740
I guess I go down here.

4893
03:26:20,060 --> 03:26:21,820
Can I carry this crystal?

4894
03:26:22,580 --> 03:26:23,120
No.

4895
03:26:29,280 --> 03:26:31,280
There is a door here, right?

4896
03:26:31,360 --> 03:26:31,860
Oh, there is!

4897
03:26:34,340 --> 03:26:35,280
What the fuck?

4898
03:26:35,520 --> 03:26:36,200
Oh, loot.

4899
03:26:39,880 --> 03:26:40,420
Alright.

4900
03:26:42,360 --> 03:26:43,080
Oh, nice!

4901
03:26:43,380 --> 03:26:44,080
More loot!

4902
03:26:46,540 --> 03:26:48,060
Alright, we're gonna grab this.

4903
03:26:49,240 --> 03:26:50,140
We're so poor.

4904
03:26:50,220 --> 03:26:51,580
We need all the money we can get.

4905
03:26:54,320 --> 03:26:56,020
Where the fuck do I go?

4906
03:26:57,080 --> 03:26:58,100
I guess this way?

4907
03:26:59,200 --> 03:26:59,640
Yeah.

4908
03:27:02,160 --> 03:27:02,600
Okay.

4909
03:27:02,600 --> 03:27:05,560
I bet you I'm like only 10% done with this game.

4910
03:27:07,520 --> 03:27:10,440
There was like 700 worlds I could go.

4911
03:27:10,520 --> 03:27:11,860
We only went to one of them.

4912
03:27:12,160 --> 03:27:12,600
That...

4913
03:27:15,460 --> 03:27:19,100
It feels like I'm only 10% done with the story.

4914
03:27:21,120 --> 03:27:25,720
They look like regular people.

4915
03:27:30,820 --> 03:27:32,300
Oh, they're a trap?

4916
03:27:35,080 --> 03:27:37,240
Turns his entire body into liquid.

4917
03:27:37,440 --> 03:27:38,520
He scared me.

4918
03:27:38,940 --> 03:27:40,460
Gary, thank you for the super chat.

4919
03:27:40,560 --> 03:27:41,260
Thank you, thank you.

4920
03:27:41,340 --> 03:27:41,760
Boom.

4921
03:27:44,360 --> 03:27:45,380
The statue!

4922
03:27:45,580 --> 03:27:46,440
We made it across!

4923
03:27:46,900 --> 03:27:47,720
We did it!

4924
03:27:48,500 --> 03:27:48,660
Jump!

4925
03:27:50,480 --> 03:27:51,000
Alright.

4926
03:27:51,000 --> 03:27:53,720
I like how they all triggered every single trap.

4927
03:27:54,900 --> 03:27:55,420
There.

4928
03:27:56,040 --> 03:27:57,540
And they all died.

4929
03:27:58,820 --> 03:28:00,380
Just for me to show up.

4930
03:28:02,920 --> 03:28:04,980
Okay, this is where I should be going.

4931
03:28:06,160 --> 03:28:07,300
So this is loot.

4932
03:28:09,200 --> 03:28:09,720
Yay!

4933
03:28:10,300 --> 03:28:10,700
Look here.

4934
03:28:11,300 --> 03:28:11,820
Read.

4935
03:28:15,650 --> 03:28:17,250
I've seen this language before.

4936
03:28:18,490 --> 03:28:19,390
Read, boy.

4937
03:28:22,790 --> 03:28:23,350
Alright.

4938
03:28:23,490 --> 03:28:24,410
I'll just steal your diary.

4939
03:28:24,570 --> 03:28:24,970
That's okay.

4940
03:28:25,510 --> 03:28:30,350
The serpent cannot be spoken to, but his belligerence towards the Aesir is unmistakable.

4941
03:28:30,890 --> 03:28:34,450
The Destruction Tires Temple is infeasible while he remains.

4942
03:28:34,650 --> 03:28:38,770
However, his presence has caused the Lake of Nine to submerge it completely.

4943
03:28:39,110 --> 03:28:40,930
Therefore, the larger aim... Alright.

4944
03:28:40,930 --> 03:28:44,450
You should have kept your diary locked up, boy.

4945
03:28:46,030 --> 03:28:46,830
Oh, hey.

4946
03:28:46,870 --> 03:28:47,730
More reads.

4947
03:28:57,550 --> 03:29:04,250
You think he's still alive?

4948
03:29:06,870 --> 03:29:07,550
Alright.

4949
03:29:07,910 --> 03:29:08,590
Open.

4950
03:29:11,010 --> 03:29:11,650
Oh.

4951
03:29:11,670 --> 03:29:12,310
Shit.

4952
03:29:13,250 --> 03:29:13,890
Oh.

4953
03:29:17,250 --> 03:29:22,790
I like how I can just literally just walk to... sidestep to the left.

4954
03:29:23,270 --> 03:29:24,490
It's just that easy.

4955
03:29:27,690 --> 03:29:28,970
Holy shit.

4956
03:29:30,770 --> 03:29:32,710
That's so fucking dumb.

4957
03:29:35,190 --> 03:29:36,990
He's like, oh no, what do I do?

4958
03:29:39,030 --> 03:29:39,670
Alright.

4959
03:29:40,930 --> 03:29:42,170
Gotta make sure they're all dead.

4960
03:29:46,680 --> 03:29:47,620
Oh shit.

4961
03:29:47,660 --> 03:29:47,940
That's two.

4962
03:29:48,680 --> 03:29:49,520
That's right.

4963
03:29:49,980 --> 03:29:51,180
You thought...

4964
03:29:51,180 --> 03:29:54,320
You thought I couldn't count and see two?

4965
03:29:54,640 --> 03:29:55,400
Oh shit!

4966
03:29:55,600 --> 03:29:56,960
It's actually three!

4967
03:29:59,760 --> 03:30:00,420
JK.

4968
03:30:01,330 --> 03:30:04,100
I actually couldn't count and it was three.

4969
03:30:07,700 --> 03:30:10,700
I can't believe it was three all along.

4970
03:30:11,540 --> 03:30:12,860
She couldn't count.

4971
03:30:13,640 --> 03:30:16,940
How the fuck was I supposed to know it was three?

4972
03:30:17,480 --> 03:30:19,760
What a fucking plot twist.

4973
03:30:23,420 --> 03:30:24,060
Yeah.

4974
03:30:27,480 --> 03:30:28,940
That's actually fucked.

4975
03:30:29,020 --> 03:30:31,060
I can't believe he did that to me.

4976
03:30:33,700 --> 03:30:34,340
Alright.

4977
03:30:34,380 --> 03:30:35,820
This is clearly extra stuff.

4978
03:30:41,520 --> 03:30:42,160
Loot.

4979
03:30:42,900 --> 03:30:43,460
Loot loot.

4980
03:30:47,100 --> 03:30:47,360
Uh...

4981
03:30:47,620 --> 03:30:48,580
I guess that was it.

4982
03:30:48,720 --> 03:30:49,640
That was all the loot.

4983
03:30:52,680 --> 03:30:53,200
Alright.

4984
03:30:55,500 --> 03:30:56,180
Can I...

4985
03:30:57,180 --> 03:30:58,680
How do I get up there?

4986
03:30:59,560 --> 03:31:00,400
I guess here?

4987
03:31:05,180 --> 03:31:07,540
The God of War does not need a count.

4988
03:31:07,840 --> 03:31:11,980
All it needs to do is beat the shit out of people.

4989
03:31:13,040 --> 03:31:14,720
Or does it need counting?

4990
03:31:15,060 --> 03:31:17,360
Who needs to count when they're all dead?

4991
03:31:18,860 --> 03:31:19,340
Alright.

4992
03:31:19,380 --> 03:31:19,960
Up we go.

4993
03:31:20,140 --> 03:31:20,660
Alright, boy.

4994
03:31:20,780 --> 03:31:21,020
Read.

4995
03:31:21,440 --> 03:31:22,440
It's a name, I think.

4996
03:31:23,260 --> 03:31:23,740
Frazzly.

4997
03:31:24,200 --> 03:31:25,240
It means terror.

4998
03:31:27,720 --> 03:31:29,120
It's all about smash.

4999
03:31:31,460 --> 03:31:31,940
Weird.

5000
03:31:31,940 --> 03:31:35,400
There's a candle all tangled up with string and some sort of animal heart.

5001
03:31:35,540 --> 03:31:36,640
Some kind of lantern?

5002
03:31:38,180 --> 03:31:38,920
Alright, loot.

5003
03:31:39,660 --> 03:31:41,380
That is of no use to us.

5004
03:31:41,460 --> 03:31:42,980
The Bifrost lights our way.

5005
03:31:44,440 --> 03:31:44,940
Alright.

5006
03:31:45,100 --> 03:31:46,140
Yeah, we don't need light?

5007
03:31:46,640 --> 03:31:48,660
Hey, what do you think about these torches?

5008
03:31:49,120 --> 03:31:49,740
What's this?

5009
03:31:50,040 --> 03:31:50,800
Is this...

5010
03:31:50,800 --> 03:31:51,420
Eyes open.

5011
03:31:51,780 --> 03:31:52,580
Okay, shortcut.

5012
03:31:52,860 --> 03:31:53,480
Okay, nice.

5013
03:31:53,540 --> 03:31:54,220
We got the shortcut.

5014
03:31:55,740 --> 03:31:56,240
Oh.

5015
03:31:56,640 --> 03:31:57,420
Fuck you.

5016
03:32:00,420 --> 03:32:02,200
You don't need to count if they're all dead.

5017
03:32:05,040 --> 03:32:05,720
What's this?

5018
03:32:08,020 --> 03:32:08,840
Oh, shit.

5019
03:32:08,880 --> 03:32:09,100
Wait.

5020
03:32:10,620 --> 03:32:11,180
Loot?

5021
03:32:13,120 --> 03:32:13,680
Loot!

5022
03:32:16,960 --> 03:32:17,880
Okay, nice.

5023
03:32:18,320 --> 03:32:18,880
Okay, nice.

5024
03:32:19,420 --> 03:32:21,480
No kid of mine is gonna count.

5025
03:32:21,860 --> 03:32:22,960
No kid of mine is gonna count.

5026
03:32:23,580 --> 03:32:25,520
I let him be a magician.

5027
03:32:25,960 --> 03:32:26,180
I let him be a magician.

5028
03:32:26,380 --> 03:32:26,940
I let him be a magician.

5029
03:32:28,060 --> 03:32:30,080
And socialize with those elves.

5030
03:32:30,500 --> 03:32:30,520
And socialize with those elves.

5031
03:32:31,040 --> 03:32:33,140
I'm gonna put my foot down on counting.

5032
03:32:35,720 --> 03:32:36,900
No, that's...

5033
03:32:36,900 --> 03:32:38,380
That's a little too much, boy.

5034
03:32:40,480 --> 03:32:42,840
Your grandpa didn't know how to count.

5035
03:32:42,960 --> 03:32:44,920
And your grandpa's grandpa's.

5036
03:32:44,940 --> 03:32:47,240
And your grandpa's grandpa's grandpa's.

5037
03:32:47,300 --> 03:32:49,040
I'm not gonna stop now.

5038
03:32:52,980 --> 03:32:54,840
You can be a magician.

5039
03:32:55,020 --> 03:32:56,160
But a nerd.

5040
03:32:56,540 --> 03:32:57,140
No.

5041
03:32:59,840 --> 03:33:00,880
Not a nerd.

5042
03:33:01,520 --> 03:33:02,520
But a nerd.

5043
03:33:02,860 --> 03:33:04,520
That's just too far, boy.

5044
03:33:10,000 --> 03:33:13,980
Go.AHHAA No boy of mine is gonna be a goddamn nerd.

5045
03:33:16,600 --> 03:33:18,100
So many thins...

5046
03:33:18,100 --> 03:33:19,540
Where the fuck do I go?

5047
03:33:20,060 --> 03:33:21,200
Where the fuck do I go?

5048
03:33:22,960 --> 03:33:25,340
There's like... There's so many things.

5049
03:33:29,260 --> 03:33:31,820
What's elven magic not enough for you, boy?

5050
03:33:35,020 --> 03:33:37,940
What's elven magic not Oh,

5051
03:33:42,100 --> 03:33:42,320
shit!

5052
03:33:47,540 --> 03:33:55,520
What did I do?

5053
03:33:58,780 --> 03:33:59,680
Oh, okay.

5054
03:34:03,160 --> 03:34:04,080
Oh, shit!

5055
03:34:05,880 --> 03:34:08,380
Alright, magic time!

5056
03:34:09,820 --> 03:34:10,480
Alright, wolves.

5057
03:34:10,660 --> 03:34:11,880
Go do your thing, wolves!

5058
03:34:13,260 --> 03:34:14,360
Go do your thing!

5059
03:34:16,360 --> 03:34:17,120
Oh, shit!

5060
03:34:19,380 --> 03:34:20,360
That's fucking right!

5061
03:34:22,540 --> 03:34:23,540
I'm gonna swing!

5062
03:34:23,760 --> 03:34:24,560
Swing to win!

5063
03:34:25,580 --> 03:34:27,820
Alright, execution style.

5064
03:34:29,800 --> 03:34:31,380
Where's the last guy?

5065
03:34:31,480 --> 03:34:32,020
Oh, there he is!

5066
03:34:32,760 --> 03:34:33,460
That's right!

5067
03:34:33,780 --> 03:34:35,600
You think I'm afraid of you?

5068
03:34:38,380 --> 03:34:39,240
That's fucking right!

5069
03:34:39,280 --> 03:34:40,940
I fought the level fours!

5070
03:34:41,700 --> 03:34:43,040
I ain't afraid of you!

5071
03:34:44,620 --> 03:34:45,400
Fucking easy.

5072
03:34:46,040 --> 03:34:47,900
Alright, we're gonna get rid of these guys, though.

5073
03:34:48,060 --> 03:34:49,340
These guys need done.

5074
03:34:50,420 --> 03:34:51,160
Alright, nice.

5075
03:34:51,500 --> 03:34:51,980
Alright.

5076
03:34:54,540 --> 03:34:55,020
Okay.

5077
03:34:56,420 --> 03:34:57,680
Where did I come from?

5078
03:34:59,200 --> 03:35:00,280
Did I come from here?

5079
03:35:01,300 --> 03:35:02,400
There's too many doors.

5080
03:35:02,480 --> 03:35:02,860
I...

5081
03:35:03,380 --> 03:35:04,500
I don't know.

5082
03:35:04,540 --> 03:35:05,600
There's too many doors.

5083
03:35:10,120 --> 03:35:11,600
Where did I go?

5084
03:35:13,380 --> 03:35:14,200
Maybe here?

5085
03:35:14,440 --> 03:35:15,180
Wait, there's something here.

5086
03:35:19,630 --> 03:35:20,730
Oh, it's blue!

5087
03:35:27,100 --> 03:35:28,240
Wait, there's something here.

5088
03:35:28,520 --> 03:35:32,180
Okay, so there's... I gotta get something out from there.

5089
03:35:35,840 --> 03:35:36,880
What's this for?

5090
03:35:37,080 --> 03:35:38,560
Okay, this is nothing.

5091
03:35:39,920 --> 03:35:40,440
Oh!

5092
03:35:40,440 --> 03:35:41,360
Fucking knew it!

5093
03:35:42,160 --> 03:35:43,300
Can't hide from me.

5094
03:35:45,240 --> 03:35:45,860
Alright.

5095
03:35:46,180 --> 03:35:46,400
Oh!

5096
03:35:47,380 --> 03:35:48,460
I looked up.

5097
03:35:49,780 --> 03:35:50,400
Loot!

5098
03:35:51,740 --> 03:35:52,360
Loot!

5099
03:35:53,680 --> 03:35:54,300
Okay.

5100
03:35:54,680 --> 03:35:54,980
Oh!

5101
03:35:56,040 --> 03:35:56,660
Words!

5102
03:35:57,260 --> 03:35:57,880
Read.

5103
03:35:59,000 --> 03:35:59,620
Boy.

5104
03:36:01,760 --> 03:36:02,880
Get over here.

5105
03:36:04,400 --> 03:36:06,180
This is why I sent you to college.

5106
03:36:07,240 --> 03:36:08,040
That's funny.

5107
03:36:08,280 --> 03:36:09,120
How so?

5108
03:36:09,420 --> 03:36:10,560
One hand wrote.

5109
03:36:10,920 --> 03:36:11,960
Jotnar only.

5110
03:36:12,580 --> 03:36:13,780
And another wrote.

5111
03:36:13,780 --> 03:36:15,200
And also doors.

5112
03:36:15,620 --> 03:36:16,620
What about the elves?

5113
03:36:20,400 --> 03:36:20,860
Oh!

5114
03:36:21,660 --> 03:36:22,880
No elves allowed.

5115
03:36:23,200 --> 03:36:26,340
We need to free the rope from under the mess you created up there, boy.

5116
03:36:26,780 --> 03:36:29,020
Maybe there's a way up there through that passage then.

5117
03:36:29,220 --> 03:36:30,940
Okay, so I have to go here.

5118
03:36:32,620 --> 03:36:33,540
Which means...

5119
03:36:34,190 --> 03:36:36,000
It could be something...

5120
03:36:36,000 --> 03:36:36,300
Oh!

5121
03:36:37,480 --> 03:36:38,360
Fucking knew it.

5122
03:36:38,900 --> 03:36:40,360
If there's wood I cut.

5123
03:36:42,020 --> 03:36:42,480
Alright.

5124
03:36:44,040 --> 03:36:44,520
Okay.

5125
03:36:45,080 --> 03:36:46,220
Can I send it up here?

5126
03:36:46,540 --> 03:36:47,020
Boy.

5127
03:36:48,440 --> 03:36:49,420
God damn it, boy.

5128
03:36:52,700 --> 03:36:54,220
How do I get up there?

5129
03:36:56,860 --> 03:36:57,340
Okay.

5130
03:36:58,840 --> 03:37:00,680
How the fuck do I get up there?

5131
03:37:01,300 --> 03:37:01,780
Boy.

5132
03:37:03,120 --> 03:37:05,420
Boy, what's the use if you can't climb anything?

5133
03:37:07,160 --> 03:37:07,640
Okay.

5134
03:37:08,340 --> 03:37:08,880
What's this?

5135
03:37:09,920 --> 03:37:10,400
Oh!

5136
03:37:10,500 --> 03:37:11,020
This is...

5137
03:37:11,020 --> 03:37:11,920
This is leaving.

5138
03:37:12,080 --> 03:37:12,460
Okay.

5139
03:37:12,460 --> 03:37:13,240
I get it.

5140
03:37:13,240 --> 03:37:13,780
God damn it, boy!

5141
03:37:16,020 --> 03:37:17,080
No elves allowed.

5142
03:37:18,600 --> 03:37:20,640
This is giants and dwarves territory.

5143
03:37:21,120 --> 03:37:25,020
We only allow dwarves and very tall people.

5144
03:37:25,260 --> 03:37:26,240
No mid-size.

5145
03:37:29,080 --> 03:37:32,280
If you're in between, you're not allowed in there.

5146
03:37:33,800 --> 03:37:35,620
I guess I go to the big orange hole.

5147
03:37:37,360 --> 03:37:38,680
Is down up?

5148
03:37:41,120 --> 03:37:42,600
Oh shit, I was about to...

5149
03:37:46,680 --> 03:37:48,420
How did you get here?

5150
03:37:49,400 --> 03:37:49,960
Yeah!

5151
03:37:57,300 --> 03:37:59,220
How did you get down here?

5152
03:38:02,320 --> 03:38:06,020
Oh, I guess because you're a dwarf, you know where the hidden places are.

5153
03:38:10,420 --> 03:38:11,240
There's traps?

5154
03:38:17,300 --> 03:38:17,820
Okay.

5155
03:38:25,600 --> 03:38:26,120
Alright,

5156
03:38:32,500 --> 03:38:34,960
I think you can upgrade stuff now, right?

5157
03:38:35,280 --> 03:38:37,440
Oh, I should get rid of the Dark Elves thing.

5158
03:38:38,680 --> 03:38:40,120
I don't need to worry about Dark Elves anymore.

5159
03:38:41,560 --> 03:38:42,940
Which one did I have it on?

5160
03:38:44,460 --> 03:38:45,860
It was my armor, right?

5161
03:38:49,420 --> 03:38:51,640
Okay, I think I... did I take it off?

5162
03:38:52,420 --> 03:38:53,200
Oh, I did!

5163
03:38:55,240 --> 03:38:59,290
Oh, I fucked up.

5164
03:38:59,370 --> 03:38:59,650
Okay.

5165
03:39:00,450 --> 03:39:01,910
Did I take it off?

5166
03:39:05,840 --> 03:39:07,100
I think I did, right?

5167
03:39:08,880 --> 03:39:09,760
Yeah, I did.

5168
03:39:09,880 --> 03:39:10,860
I removed it.

5169
03:39:10,920 --> 03:39:11,560
Okay, that's good.

5170
03:39:12,300 --> 03:39:13,500
Alright, that's good.

5171
03:39:13,760 --> 03:39:16,360
Alright, I should be able to... Oh, yeah, I could definitely...

5172
03:39:16,360 --> 03:39:17,220
Yeah!

5173
03:39:19,920 --> 03:39:22,820
Yeah, I should start upgrading my stuff.

5174
03:39:26,800 --> 03:39:28,740
I'm a little behind on that.

5175
03:39:32,320 --> 03:39:33,140
Let's see.

5176
03:39:35,020 --> 03:39:36,060
Yeah, that's awkward.

5177
03:39:37,060 --> 03:39:38,980
I already have a lot of this throwing stuff.

5178
03:39:42,940 --> 03:39:46,060
I'm using a lot of close combat now, so...

5179
03:39:47,020 --> 03:39:49,560
Well, I don't dodge, so I don't need that.

5180
03:39:49,880 --> 03:39:52,120
While sprinting, increase the amount...

5181
03:39:52,120 --> 03:39:52,200
Oh!

5182
03:39:52,420 --> 03:39:53,240
Like that.

5183
03:39:54,520 --> 03:39:56,080
While evading... While sprinting...

5184
03:39:56,540 --> 03:39:59,440
Okay, I don't sprint, so we definitely don't need that.

5185
03:40:02,540 --> 03:40:03,640
I already have that.

5186
03:40:05,560 --> 03:40:07,980
Hold R... Hold R to...

5187
03:40:07,980 --> 03:40:08,300
Ooh!

5188
03:40:08,920 --> 03:40:10,200
I'll perform a more...

5189
03:40:10,200 --> 03:40:11,960
A more powerful rage.

5190
03:40:12,860 --> 03:40:15,100
Okay, I don't do any of this.

5191
03:40:16,840 --> 03:40:18,160
Okay, shield combat.

5192
03:40:18,340 --> 03:40:19,760
I guess I'll do this, too.

5193
03:40:20,220 --> 03:40:21,560
Alright, that's fine.

5194
03:40:26,260 --> 03:40:30,460
Oh my god, where do I go?

5195
03:40:31,880 --> 03:40:33,420
When you're given too many choices.

5196
03:40:35,980 --> 03:40:37,020
Where does this go?

5197
03:40:38,360 --> 03:40:39,420
Where the fuck?

5198
03:40:40,680 --> 03:40:41,680
Where am I?

5199
03:40:43,140 --> 03:40:44,180
Where the fuck?

5200
03:40:44,280 --> 03:40:44,380
Oh!

5201
03:40:44,940 --> 03:40:45,840
Oh, loot!

5202
03:40:48,140 --> 03:40:49,320
Okay, nice.

5203
03:40:52,480 --> 03:40:53,160
Oh!

5204
03:40:53,760 --> 03:40:54,440
Rage.

5205
03:40:55,280 --> 03:40:56,140
What's this?

5206
03:40:58,760 --> 03:40:59,960
Oh, it's door!

5207
03:41:01,080 --> 03:41:01,760
Okay.

5208
03:41:02,960 --> 03:41:04,860
I guess I'll grab this.

5209
03:41:07,780 --> 03:41:08,460
Loot!

5210
03:41:11,500 --> 03:41:12,100
Um...

5211
03:41:12,100 --> 03:41:13,000
Oh!

5212
03:41:13,240 --> 03:41:13,680
Nice.

5213
03:41:14,100 --> 03:41:15,880
I need that seal for armor.

5214
03:41:16,600 --> 03:41:17,660
More traps.

5215
03:41:17,920 --> 03:41:18,520
Traps?

5216
03:41:19,380 --> 03:41:20,700
There's a tunnel, but...

5217
03:41:20,700 --> 03:41:20,900
Oh!

5218
03:41:21,760 --> 03:41:22,640
Break it.

5219
03:41:23,060 --> 03:41:23,660
Okay.

5220
03:41:25,320 --> 03:41:26,860
I see it now.

5221
03:41:28,940 --> 03:41:30,140
A trap?

5222
03:41:30,620 --> 03:41:31,700
It is a mountain.

5223
03:41:32,420 --> 03:41:33,260
Break it.

5224
03:41:36,200 --> 03:41:37,900
Guys, did you guys see that trap?

5225
03:41:38,060 --> 03:41:38,440
Yeah.

5226
03:41:39,620 --> 03:41:40,380
Oh!

5227
03:41:41,000 --> 03:41:42,900
God fucking...

5228
03:41:44,420 --> 03:41:45,180
Okay.

5229
03:41:46,580 --> 03:41:47,620
First try.

5230
03:41:48,200 --> 03:41:49,160
All right.

5231
03:41:49,220 --> 03:41:50,820
Let's go this way.

5232
03:41:51,480 --> 03:41:52,240
Oh!

5233
03:41:52,260 --> 03:41:53,020
That one guy was...

5234
03:41:53,020 --> 03:41:53,900
That one was sneaky.

5235
03:41:54,300 --> 03:41:55,720
Because he didn't say anything.

5236
03:41:57,200 --> 03:41:58,560
Okay, we just...

5237
03:41:58,560 --> 03:41:58,960
What?

5238
03:42:01,620 --> 03:42:02,380
Oh.

5239
03:42:02,560 --> 03:42:04,440
What kind of fucking trap is this?

5240
03:42:04,860 --> 03:42:05,480
Oh!

5241
03:42:06,820 --> 03:42:07,860
You okay?

5242
03:42:07,980 --> 03:42:08,440
I'm okay.

5243
03:42:08,460 --> 03:42:09,740
Heya!

5244
03:42:11,360 --> 03:42:12,160
Let's go!

5245
03:42:13,040 --> 03:42:13,840
Oh, God!

5246
03:42:16,520 --> 03:42:17,240
I was going back.

5247
03:42:19,920 --> 03:42:20,640
Oh!

5248
03:42:20,920 --> 03:42:21,000
That was close.

5249
03:42:21,000 --> 03:42:23,120
I don't know how to...

5250
03:42:23,760 --> 03:42:29,170
I wasn't supposed to know that was gonna happen!

5251
03:42:31,150 --> 03:42:31,870
Okay.

5252
03:42:34,990 --> 03:42:35,710
No?

5253
03:42:37,310 --> 03:42:38,610
Get over here!

5254
03:42:43,550 --> 03:42:44,110
What?

5255
03:42:44,890 --> 03:42:45,950
Oh shit!

5256
03:42:48,010 --> 03:42:48,570
Oh.

5257
03:42:49,430 --> 03:42:50,370
Oh shit, no!

5258
03:42:50,510 --> 03:42:52,930
I didn't do any upgrades on close combat!

5259
03:42:53,110 --> 03:42:53,770
We can't do it!

5260
03:42:55,930 --> 03:42:56,490
Alright.

5261
03:42:56,490 --> 03:42:58,190
This one I can just near you.

5262
03:42:59,870 --> 03:43:00,990
I'll just do that.

5263
03:43:01,790 --> 03:43:02,790
Can't be bothered.

5264
03:43:03,770 --> 03:43:05,070
No you do not, boy!

5265
03:43:05,590 --> 03:43:07,050
No you do not!

5266
03:43:08,970 --> 03:43:09,370
Huh?

5267
03:43:11,930 --> 03:43:13,230
Wait, there's something over there.

5268
03:43:13,970 --> 03:43:16,010
I guess that's where I'm supposed to go?

5269
03:43:16,130 --> 03:43:17,070
Wait, what the fuck is that?

5270
03:43:18,150 --> 03:43:19,250
Is that dead troll?

5271
03:43:21,410 --> 03:43:21,810
No!

5272
03:43:22,750 --> 03:43:23,770
What the fuck are you?

5273
03:43:31,900 --> 03:43:32,780
What are you?

5274
03:43:35,520 --> 03:43:35,920
What?

5275
03:43:39,530 --> 03:43:40,350
What is that?

5276
03:43:44,590 --> 03:43:45,490
Catch it?

5277
03:43:48,370 --> 03:43:49,850
How do I catch it?

5278
03:43:54,550 --> 03:43:56,090
How do I catch it?

5279
03:44:01,960 --> 03:44:02,640
What?

5280
03:44:08,300 --> 03:44:08,980
What?

5281
03:44:12,420 --> 03:44:14,120
That's right, I'm gonna grab my hands.

5282
03:44:14,640 --> 03:44:15,940
Oh shit!

5283
03:44:16,140 --> 03:44:18,020
Oh, I just gotta punch it.

5284
03:44:18,160 --> 03:44:22,100
If all else fails, just punch your problems away.

5285
03:44:23,640 --> 03:44:25,120
Who would've thought?

5286
03:44:26,700 --> 03:44:28,980
All I had to do was punch.

5287
03:44:29,220 --> 03:44:30,780
I can't believe I...

5288
03:44:30,780 --> 03:44:34,120
I can't believe I forgot the most important lesson.

5289
03:44:34,820 --> 03:44:35,620
Just punch it.

5290
03:44:37,440 --> 03:44:38,040
No!

5291
03:44:39,180 --> 03:44:41,060
Oh my god, that's so sad.

5292
03:44:41,480 --> 03:44:42,300
The little guy.

5293
03:44:42,780 --> 03:44:43,980
I heard a crow.

5294
03:44:47,540 --> 03:44:48,140
Okay.

5295
03:44:50,720 --> 03:44:51,500
Let's see.

5296
03:44:53,720 --> 03:44:55,440
Yeah, I got the bridge over there.

5297
03:44:55,620 --> 03:44:57,180
And I'll grab these bridges too.

5298
03:45:00,180 --> 03:45:01,240
Can I climb up that?

5299
03:45:01,340 --> 03:45:01,880
Oh, okay, I can.

5300
03:45:02,280 --> 03:45:02,720
Nice.

5301
03:45:03,220 --> 03:45:04,360
Oh no, I can't.

5302
03:45:04,360 --> 03:45:04,620
Okay.

5303
03:45:06,240 --> 03:45:06,680
Um...

5304
03:45:07,260 --> 03:45:08,960
There's like something here too.

5305
03:45:09,780 --> 03:45:11,260
How do I get there?

5306
03:45:11,580 --> 03:45:12,300
Can I pull it?

5307
03:45:14,060 --> 03:45:15,940
I'm a strong... Oh, there it is.

5308
03:45:19,570 --> 03:45:20,090
Oh!

5309
03:45:20,210 --> 03:45:21,030
And we're stuck.

5310
03:45:21,390 --> 03:45:22,170
Oh, we're not.

5311
03:45:22,350 --> 03:45:23,210
I see that.

5312
03:45:23,750 --> 03:45:24,410
All right.

5313
03:45:24,710 --> 03:45:24,930
Let's go!

5314
03:45:27,230 --> 03:45:29,790
You think this can stop me?

5315
03:45:30,610 --> 03:45:32,510
I just push it through this?

5316
03:45:33,790 --> 03:45:35,270
I guess I do, right?

5317
03:45:35,510 --> 03:45:35,570
That's it!

5318
03:45:39,490 --> 03:45:40,950
Okay, I should push it here.

5319
03:45:41,850 --> 03:45:43,250
And then... Oh!

5320
03:45:43,730 --> 03:45:46,390
But then I heard there's something here though.

5321
03:45:46,470 --> 03:45:46,830
Oh, loot.

5322
03:45:47,670 --> 03:45:48,190
Loot!

5323
03:45:50,190 --> 03:45:50,450
Nice.

5324
03:45:50,790 --> 03:45:51,570
More money.

5325
03:45:52,130 --> 03:45:54,130
Maybe there's a way through that big gate up there?

5326
03:45:55,150 --> 03:45:55,670
Yes.

5327
03:45:56,110 --> 03:45:56,630
Arteus.

5328
03:45:56,750 --> 03:45:57,290
Yes, boy.

5329
03:45:57,550 --> 03:45:58,710
We go up.

5330
03:45:59,330 --> 03:46:00,930
And then we go up.

5331
03:46:02,770 --> 03:46:04,310
How do I get past this?

5332
03:46:06,710 --> 03:46:10,330
I can bash through any wood except for that wood door.

5333
03:46:12,470 --> 03:46:13,570
I don't understand.

5334
03:46:14,210 --> 03:46:17,310
What makes that wood door different from all the other wood doors?

5335
03:46:17,830 --> 03:46:18,810
Can I go through?

5336
03:46:18,870 --> 03:46:19,030
Oh!

5337
03:46:22,690 --> 03:46:23,150
Oh!

5338
03:46:23,330 --> 03:46:23,790
Okay.

5339
03:46:23,930 --> 03:46:24,470
Never mind.

5340
03:46:31,650 --> 03:46:33,110
What could they be for?

5341
03:46:33,670 --> 03:46:35,050
There's something special.

5342
03:46:35,230 --> 03:46:35,690
Easy.

5343
03:46:36,130 --> 03:46:36,690
I can feel it.

5344
03:46:37,950 --> 03:46:39,170
There's something special?

5345
03:46:40,670 --> 03:46:43,510
Okay, we gotta get the fast pass here.

5346
03:46:44,890 --> 03:46:45,810
And then...

5347
03:46:46,430 --> 03:46:47,990
Wait, what was the lamp?

5348
03:46:48,150 --> 03:46:48,870
Oh, this lamp.

5349
03:46:50,090 --> 03:46:50,550
Okay.

5350
03:46:51,630 --> 03:46:52,730
How do I get there?

5351
03:46:52,810 --> 03:46:53,430
Oh!

5352
03:46:55,570 --> 03:46:56,610
Pull the door.

5353
03:46:59,850 --> 03:47:02,650
If I pull the door, do I pull it all the way?

5354
03:47:05,250 --> 03:47:06,730
How do I get over there?

5355
03:47:07,750 --> 03:47:08,570
On the...

5356
03:47:08,570 --> 03:47:09,090
Oh!

5357
03:47:09,250 --> 03:47:10,650
I pushed the box!

5358
03:47:11,230 --> 03:47:12,730
I pushed the box!

5359
03:47:13,910 --> 03:47:17,190
My brain is, like, working overtime right now.

5360
03:47:17,470 --> 03:47:18,750
How do I get over there?

5361
03:47:20,310 --> 03:47:21,770
What about there?

5362
03:47:22,230 --> 03:47:22,790
Oh!

5363
03:47:24,110 --> 03:47:24,630
Okay.

5364
03:47:25,810 --> 03:47:26,330
Light.

5365
03:47:28,630 --> 03:47:29,150
Oh!

5366
03:47:29,950 --> 03:47:30,350
Oh!

5367
03:47:31,370 --> 03:47:32,910
Okay, that actually scared me.

5368
03:47:34,450 --> 03:47:35,390
There he is!

5369
03:47:35,490 --> 03:47:36,110
I see you!

5370
03:47:37,670 --> 03:47:39,450
I see you, government drone!

5371
03:47:41,310 --> 03:47:42,610
Okay, go, wolves, go!

5372
03:47:43,690 --> 03:47:44,750
Go, wolves, go!

5373
03:47:47,670 --> 03:47:48,190
Yay!

5374
03:47:50,570 --> 03:47:51,090
Okay.

5375
03:47:51,690 --> 03:47:52,770
I mean, I don't actually...

5376
03:47:52,790 --> 03:47:53,770
I don't actually need to get close to him.

5377
03:47:55,190 --> 03:47:55,770
Easy.

5378
03:47:56,190 --> 03:47:56,990
Oh, shit!

5379
03:47:58,570 --> 03:47:59,690
That's fucking right.

5380
03:48:00,030 --> 03:48:01,410
You're still easy!

5381
03:48:02,350 --> 03:48:03,250
That's right!

5382
03:48:04,470 --> 03:48:05,910
I don't take it back!

5383
03:48:06,590 --> 03:48:07,810
You're fucking easy!

5384
03:48:08,130 --> 03:48:09,150
Oh, I'm so sorry.

5385
03:48:09,230 --> 03:48:09,890
I'm so sorry.

5386
03:48:09,970 --> 03:48:10,610
I did not mean that.

5387
03:48:13,330 --> 03:48:14,110
All right.

5388
03:48:14,810 --> 03:48:15,390
Nice.

5389
03:48:15,990 --> 03:48:17,210
Okay, and then...

5390
03:48:18,410 --> 03:48:19,330
Fast pass?

5391
03:48:21,070 --> 03:48:21,970
Fast pass?

5392
03:48:22,290 --> 03:48:22,770
Fast pass?

5393
03:48:25,530 --> 03:48:26,010
Okay.

5394
03:48:26,050 --> 03:48:26,290
Oh.

5395
03:48:26,430 --> 03:48:27,370
They can do combos.

5396
03:48:27,690 --> 03:48:28,610
Let me fast pass!

5397
03:48:29,630 --> 03:48:30,110
Hello?

5398
03:48:31,130 --> 03:48:32,290
There's no more enemies!

5399
03:48:34,970 --> 03:48:35,450
Oh.

5400
03:48:35,730 --> 03:48:36,370
Never mind.

5401
03:48:36,710 --> 03:48:37,190
Okay.

5402
03:48:37,250 --> 03:48:38,590
That makes a lot more sense now.

5403
03:48:39,210 --> 03:48:41,050
I was like wondering why I couldn't do it.

5404
03:48:42,390 --> 03:48:42,930
All right.

5405
03:48:43,030 --> 03:48:44,090
Use your little arrows!

5406
03:48:46,530 --> 03:48:47,490
Use your little...

5407
03:48:47,490 --> 03:48:48,050
Oh, shit!

5408
03:48:49,170 --> 03:48:50,330
Use your little arrows!

5409
03:48:50,550 --> 03:48:51,530
Oh, shit!

5410
03:48:51,890 --> 03:48:52,370
Use your little arrows!

5411
03:48:52,370 --> 03:48:52,770
Oh, shit!

5412
03:48:52,790 --> 03:48:53,230
Oh, shit!

5413
03:48:53,230 --> 03:48:53,370
There you go!

5414
03:48:53,950 --> 03:48:54,510
Nice.

5415
03:48:55,050 --> 03:48:55,610
Okay.

5416
03:48:55,690 --> 03:48:56,170
Fast pass.

5417
03:48:57,690 --> 03:48:58,470
Fast pass?

5418
03:48:58,870 --> 03:48:59,530
Ready Enwade!

5419
03:49:00,810 --> 03:49:01,550
Fast pass?

5420
03:49:02,670 --> 03:49:04,050
Is there still more?

5421
03:49:04,650 --> 03:49:05,210
No.

5422
03:49:05,330 --> 03:49:06,030
I killed everything.

5423
03:49:06,750 --> 03:49:07,550
Fast pass.

5424
03:49:10,430 --> 03:49:10,990
Oh!

5425
03:49:11,430 --> 03:49:11,990
Okay.

5426
03:49:12,070 --> 03:49:12,350
Never mind.

5427
03:49:13,030 --> 03:49:13,990
Never mind.

5428
03:49:14,010 --> 03:49:14,710
There's still more.

5429
03:49:16,110 --> 03:49:16,670
Phew!

5430
03:49:18,870 --> 03:49:19,430
Phew!

5431
03:49:20,810 --> 03:49:21,370
Phew!

5432
03:49:21,770 --> 03:49:22,070
Look.

5433
03:49:22,290 --> 03:49:22,710
I could.

5434
03:49:22,790 --> 03:49:24,430
I would get closer, but like, why?

5435
03:49:25,670 --> 03:49:27,110
This is much more important.

5436
03:49:27,590 --> 03:49:28,310
Fast pass.

5437
03:49:28,610 --> 03:49:29,450
Nice, I did it!

5438
03:49:30,250 --> 03:49:31,270
Guys, you don't understand.

5439
03:49:31,470 --> 03:49:32,610
That was like way more important.

5440
03:49:32,930 --> 03:49:33,970
Oh, I stopped moving.

5441
03:49:35,910 --> 03:49:39,890
Sorry, I died of cringe, guys.

5442
03:49:45,790 --> 03:49:47,970
I was too absorbed with...

5443
03:49:47,970 --> 03:49:49,770
I was too absorbed with the...

5444
03:49:50,150 --> 03:49:51,010
with the fast pass.

5445
03:49:52,790 --> 03:49:53,790
Alright, loot.

5446
03:49:55,150 --> 03:49:55,750
Okay.

5447
03:50:00,830 --> 03:50:02,350
Where is... wait, what?

5448
03:50:02,390 --> 03:50:03,150
All the old stuff.

5449
03:50:03,450 --> 03:50:04,810
That was just one thing.

5450
03:50:05,410 --> 03:50:06,870
There's more old stuff?

5451
03:50:07,750 --> 03:50:08,670
Oh, there is.

5452
03:50:10,190 --> 03:50:10,790
Alright.

5453
03:50:12,090 --> 03:50:12,690
Nice.

5454
03:50:14,270 --> 03:50:14,870
Okay.

5455
03:50:15,270 --> 03:50:16,270
Up I go.

5456
03:50:17,430 --> 03:50:18,370
Up I go.

5457
03:50:18,450 --> 03:50:18,870
Oh, nice!

5458
03:50:19,250 --> 03:50:20,250
That's what I wanted.

5459
03:50:22,950 --> 03:50:23,550
Yay!

5460
03:50:24,730 --> 03:50:26,090
Your god's not real!

5461
03:50:26,770 --> 03:50:27,370
Alright.

5462
03:50:27,530 --> 03:50:27,830
Yay!

5463
03:50:32,510 --> 03:50:33,110
Alright.

5464
03:50:33,990 --> 03:50:35,050
I think we have everything.

5465
03:50:36,550 --> 03:50:37,150
Uh...

5466
03:50:37,150 --> 03:50:38,930
Oh yeah, I gotta push this.

5467
03:50:41,970 --> 03:50:42,570
Oh!

5468
03:50:42,610 --> 03:50:43,170
Nope.

5469
03:50:47,740 --> 03:50:48,900
Gotta push!

5470
03:50:50,120 --> 03:50:51,080
Push, push, push!

5471
03:50:53,960 --> 03:50:55,000
Did I do it?

5472
03:50:55,160 --> 03:50:55,800
Is it here?

5473
03:50:57,860 --> 03:50:58,820
Up I go.

5474
03:50:59,800 --> 03:51:00,840
And then... jump!

5475
03:51:02,940 --> 03:51:03,800
I did it!

5476
03:51:04,640 --> 03:51:05,700
That's so easy!

5477
03:51:07,720 --> 03:51:09,320
I wonder if I can push it more.

5478
03:51:11,600 --> 03:51:13,120
Would it go anywhere if I...

5479
03:51:13,120 --> 03:51:13,960
Oh no, it doesn't.

5480
03:51:14,020 --> 03:51:14,200
Okay.

5481
03:51:14,980 --> 03:51:15,500
Alright.

5482
03:51:15,740 --> 03:51:17,020
Gotta go this way.

5483
03:51:17,280 --> 03:51:17,900
Where's the loot?

5484
03:51:17,980 --> 03:51:18,840
Oh, there it is!

5485
03:51:22,080 --> 03:51:23,340
The golden chest!

5486
03:51:27,760 --> 03:51:28,800
Okay, summon...

5487
03:51:28,800 --> 03:51:29,780
Wait!

5488
03:51:29,780 --> 03:51:30,040
Wait!

5489
03:51:30,040 --> 03:51:30,560
What?

5490
03:51:37,130 --> 03:51:38,230
What is the bird?

5491
03:51:38,330 --> 03:51:39,890
Oh my god!

5492
03:51:39,950 --> 03:51:40,950
Wait a minute!

5493
03:51:41,610 --> 03:51:43,410
The birds are cooler!

5494
03:51:44,250 --> 03:51:46,150
Oh, the damage fucking sucks.

5495
03:51:46,290 --> 03:51:46,730
Nevermind.

5496
03:51:48,810 --> 03:51:51,870
Yeah, but it's one damage though!

5497
03:51:52,650 --> 03:51:54,090
Like, look at it!

5498
03:51:54,150 --> 03:51:55,390
It's one damage!

5499
03:51:58,330 --> 03:51:59,470
I don't know.

5500
03:51:59,870 --> 03:52:01,970
The damage is like one!

5501
03:52:02,350 --> 03:52:03,490
Okay, we'll try.

5502
03:52:03,490 --> 03:52:04,390
We're gonna try it.

5503
03:52:04,450 --> 03:52:05,350
We'll see how that goes.

5504
03:52:07,310 --> 03:52:08,550
I'll give it a shot.

5505
03:52:08,850 --> 03:52:10,370
I'll give it like two tries.

5506
03:52:11,670 --> 03:52:13,830
One is better than zero.

5507
03:52:15,130 --> 03:52:16,990
Yeah, but the wolf does three!

5508
03:52:20,730 --> 03:52:23,150
But the wolf does three damage though!

5509
03:52:23,750 --> 03:52:25,030
That's more than one!

5510
03:52:26,330 --> 03:52:27,390
Alright, up I go.

5511
03:52:31,590 --> 03:52:33,590
I wonder why RTS doesn't go like...

5512
03:52:34,810 --> 03:52:36,150
How does my dad...

5513
03:52:36,150 --> 03:52:37,350
I don't...

5514
03:52:37,350 --> 03:52:40,230
I feel like he'd be like, I don't think my dad's a human!

5515
03:52:40,490 --> 03:52:41,410
At that point.

5516
03:52:43,570 --> 03:52:45,350
When does he start...

5517
03:52:46,070 --> 03:52:48,450
When does he start doubting himself?

5518
03:52:49,970 --> 03:52:50,450
Okay.

5519
03:52:51,550 --> 03:52:53,070
When does he figure it out?

5520
03:52:56,050 --> 03:52:56,530
Uh...

5521
03:52:56,530 --> 03:52:57,890
I guess we have to...

5522
03:52:57,890 --> 03:52:59,050
We gotta go this way now.

5523
03:53:00,810 --> 03:53:01,650
You're the only...

5524
03:53:02,210 --> 03:53:03,130
Oh shit!

5525
03:53:05,450 --> 03:53:06,750
This is it!

5526
03:53:07,430 --> 03:53:08,750
I should have waited!

5527
03:53:10,390 --> 03:53:14,280
Guys, I should have waited.

5528
03:53:18,820 --> 03:53:19,860
I realize...

5529
03:53:19,860 --> 03:53:21,440
I realize I should have...

5530
03:53:21,440 --> 03:53:22,860
No, punch the other leg!

5531
03:53:23,060 --> 03:53:24,480
Why are you punching the left leg?

5532
03:53:24,920 --> 03:53:27,000
There's so many legs to punch!

5533
03:53:27,260 --> 03:53:30,880
Why are you punching the one leg that doesn't matter?

5534
03:53:32,080 --> 03:53:32,600
Okay.

5535
03:53:33,420 --> 03:53:33,940
Okay.

5536
03:53:34,340 --> 03:53:34,860
Okay.

5537
03:53:34,860 --> 03:53:37,240
I don't understand.

5538
03:53:37,780 --> 03:53:38,400
Please!

5539
03:53:38,780 --> 03:53:39,120
I sh...

5540
03:53:40,460 --> 03:53:42,500
There's so many legs!

5541
03:53:47,800 --> 03:53:51,460
Why are you not hitting the legs I want you to hit?

5542
03:53:55,260 --> 03:53:56,300
Oh shit, nice!

5543
03:53:56,980 --> 03:53:57,960
Got on the troll.

5544
03:53:59,080 --> 03:54:00,040
Stop hitting yourself!

5545
03:54:00,360 --> 03:54:01,460
Stop hitting yourself!

5546
03:54:02,400 --> 03:54:03,200
That's right.

5547
03:54:03,400 --> 03:54:04,560
You might be...

5548
03:54:04,560 --> 03:54:04,840
Bad to me!

5549
03:54:06,060 --> 03:54:08,080
But you can't stop me!

5550
03:54:08,960 --> 03:54:10,680
It's not about the size!

5551
03:54:13,300 --> 03:54:14,060
Oh, okay.

5552
03:54:14,200 --> 03:54:15,000
We did it.

5553
03:54:16,180 --> 03:54:17,800
Okay, now use your crow.

5554
03:54:20,040 --> 03:54:20,960
Oh, shit!

5555
03:54:21,120 --> 03:54:21,360
Whoops.

5556
03:54:24,060 --> 03:54:24,580
Alright.

5557
03:54:25,640 --> 03:54:26,160
Oh!

5558
03:54:26,260 --> 03:54:27,020
Oh, god, I...

5559
03:54:27,020 --> 03:54:28,660
I got the duck in time.

5560
03:54:28,940 --> 03:54:30,860
Where the fuck did my axe go?!

5561
03:54:31,640 --> 03:54:34,200
Where did my axe go?!

5562
03:54:35,200 --> 03:54:36,160
Holy shit.

5563
03:54:39,340 --> 03:54:41,340
Bro, I know I'm almost dead!

5564
03:54:41,560 --> 03:54:43,480
That's why I need your help, boy!

5565
03:54:43,840 --> 03:54:44,600
Oh, no.

5566
03:54:44,740 --> 03:54:45,380
Oh, no.

5567
03:54:45,460 --> 03:54:46,580
Please don't burn out.

5568
03:54:46,660 --> 03:54:47,620
Please don't burn out.

5569
03:54:47,900 --> 03:54:48,400
Please.

5570
03:54:48,780 --> 03:54:49,280
Please.

5571
03:54:51,680 --> 03:54:52,380
Oh, god.

5572
03:54:52,940 --> 03:54:53,620
Oh, god.

5573
03:54:54,120 --> 03:54:55,020
Oh, thank god.

5574
03:54:55,740 --> 03:54:56,740
Thank god, boy.

5575
03:54:58,100 --> 03:55:00,640
Boy, why did you aim that way?!

5576
03:55:01,620 --> 03:55:02,120
Fuck.

5577
03:55:03,440 --> 03:55:03,940
Please.

5578
03:55:04,200 --> 03:55:05,060
Oh, boy!

5579
03:55:05,300 --> 03:55:09,660
Why did you not aim that way?!

5580
03:55:12,540 --> 03:55:16,160
Holy shit, he could've aimed anywhere else.

5581
03:55:16,380 --> 03:55:19,380
Why the fuck did he aim that way?!

5582
03:55:19,380 --> 03:55:21,760
Wait, where did I kill the troll?!

5583
03:55:21,760 --> 03:55:23,400
Did he spawn?

5584
03:55:23,620 --> 03:55:24,220
Oh, there it is.

5585
03:55:24,680 --> 03:55:25,620
Oh, thank god.

5586
03:55:25,800 --> 03:55:27,480
That was actually 1 HP.

5587
03:55:30,990 --> 03:55:32,320
Oh, thank god.

5588
03:55:32,320 --> 03:55:35,620
We can upgrade our fucking axe again.

5589
03:55:37,220 --> 03:55:39,780
It sends out a line of ice shards?

5590
03:55:40,060 --> 03:55:40,240
Ooh!

5591
03:55:40,820 --> 03:55:41,980
Wait, that's cool.

5592
03:55:43,040 --> 03:55:43,860
What is this?

5593
03:55:43,980 --> 03:55:45,100
The river of night.

5594
03:55:45,420 --> 03:55:47,080
Really increased the...

5595
03:55:47,080 --> 03:55:48,300
Ooh!

5596
03:55:49,820 --> 03:55:50,460
Ooh!

5597
03:55:50,880 --> 03:55:51,840
I wanna try that.

5598
03:55:54,460 --> 03:55:55,880
Alright, we're okay.

5599
03:55:56,640 --> 03:55:57,580
We're okay.

5600
03:55:57,880 --> 03:55:58,500
Alright.

5601
03:55:58,980 --> 03:56:00,240
Guys, I...

5602
03:56:00,240 --> 03:56:01,260
Guys.

5603
03:56:01,760 --> 03:56:05,800
I think after what we saw with the crows, we're gonna go with...

5604
03:56:06,760 --> 03:56:09,400
I think we're gonna go with the wolf after that.

5605
03:56:09,560 --> 03:56:09,860
I...

5606
03:56:09,860 --> 03:56:10,320
I...

5607
03:56:11,100 --> 03:56:12,060
I think...

5608
03:56:13,660 --> 03:56:15,320
I think we realized...

5609
03:56:17,100 --> 03:56:18,340
Are you still fighting?

5610
03:56:19,500 --> 03:56:21,220
Okay, we gotta get rid of...

5611
03:56:21,220 --> 03:56:22,480
We gotta get rid of the crows.

5612
03:56:25,280 --> 03:56:26,320
God damn it!

5613
03:56:27,540 --> 03:56:27,980
Okay.

5614
03:56:28,760 --> 03:56:30,780
Apparently, he does not wanna use the wolves.

5615
03:56:32,680 --> 03:56:33,660
I don't know.

5616
03:56:33,700 --> 03:56:35,320
I'm still not convinced.

5617
03:56:38,120 --> 03:56:46,660
Yeah, that part where like, you know, the guy was right in front of him, but instead he decided to, you know, shoot everything but that.

5618
03:56:47,100 --> 03:56:47,580
Oh.

5619
03:56:47,840 --> 03:56:49,060
Am I supposed to...

5620
03:56:51,140 --> 03:56:52,100
What am I supposed to do?

5621
03:56:54,660 --> 03:56:55,140
What?

5622
03:56:57,280 --> 03:56:57,760
Oh.

5623
03:56:58,740 --> 03:56:59,220
Okay.

5624
03:56:59,280 --> 03:56:59,640
Okay.

5625
03:57:00,280 --> 03:57:00,760
Okay.

5626
03:57:00,760 --> 03:57:02,220
That's what I'm supposed to do.

5627
03:57:03,320 --> 03:57:04,000
Now what?

5628
03:57:07,830 --> 03:57:08,230
Oh.

5629
03:57:09,790 --> 03:57:10,190
Oh!

5630
03:57:13,650 --> 03:57:14,050
Alright.

5631
03:57:15,770 --> 03:57:17,230
Push, push, push, push, push.

5632
03:57:18,110 --> 03:57:18,870
Push, push, push.

5633
03:57:19,010 --> 03:57:20,470
Okay, boy, can I finally...

5634
03:57:20,470 --> 03:57:21,390
Okay, thank god.

5635
03:57:21,490 --> 03:57:21,750
Okay.

5636
03:57:22,090 --> 03:57:22,490
Alright.

5637
03:57:22,830 --> 03:57:23,530
No more...

5638
03:57:23,530 --> 03:57:24,590
No more brews for you.

5639
03:57:25,390 --> 03:57:26,610
No more brews for you.

5640
03:57:27,650 --> 03:57:28,290
There you go.

5641
03:57:31,350 --> 03:57:32,170
Up we go!

5642
03:57:32,310 --> 03:57:32,490
Okay.

5643
03:57:34,130 --> 03:57:35,230
Here we go!

5644
03:57:35,370 --> 03:57:35,530
Yay!

5645
03:57:39,070 --> 03:57:40,930
Do you think this goes all the way to the top?

5646
03:57:41,090 --> 03:57:42,390
Oh, fucking no, boy.

5647
03:57:43,110 --> 03:57:45,370
I'm like here at the same place as you are.

5648
03:57:45,910 --> 03:57:46,390
Like...

5649
03:57:47,050 --> 03:57:49,370
We are both experiencing the same thing together.

5650
03:57:49,830 --> 03:57:51,650
How am I supposed to know more than you?

5651
03:57:51,750 --> 03:57:52,750
We're literally here together.

5652
03:57:53,390 --> 03:57:56,050
Do not concern yourself with what might be.

5653
03:57:56,590 --> 03:57:57,810
Focus on what is.

5654
03:57:58,270 --> 03:57:59,390
And be vigilant.

5655
03:58:00,130 --> 03:58:00,770
Yes, sir.

5656
03:58:01,350 --> 03:58:01,830
Alright.

5657
03:58:07,170 --> 03:58:08,570
Not the top.

5658
03:58:08,730 --> 03:58:09,690
But we're closer.

5659
03:58:09,890 --> 03:58:10,110
Oh.

5660
03:58:10,590 --> 03:58:13,050
It took like forever to get there.

5661
03:58:13,690 --> 03:58:14,810
Holy shit.

5662
03:58:14,830 --> 03:58:15,670
That was really high.

5663
03:58:19,800 --> 03:58:20,360
Wait!

5664
03:58:20,580 --> 03:58:21,660
That one's not broken!

5665
03:58:22,380 --> 03:58:23,260
What is that?

5666
03:58:23,480 --> 03:58:24,200
Is that the lantern?

5667
03:58:24,600 --> 03:58:25,260
There's a note.

5668
03:58:26,260 --> 03:58:27,520
A giant's cry.

5669
03:58:28,500 --> 03:58:30,920
They're asking their ancestors to watch over them.

5670
03:58:31,440 --> 03:58:32,480
To guide them.

5671
03:58:32,480 --> 03:58:33,180
Well, they're all dead.

5672
03:58:34,660 --> 03:58:35,220
Boy.

5673
03:58:35,840 --> 03:58:36,400
Wait.

5674
03:58:36,560 --> 03:58:36,720
Wait.

5675
03:58:36,720 --> 03:58:36,940
Wait.

5676
03:58:37,640 --> 03:58:38,200
Wait.

5677
03:58:38,220 --> 03:58:39,760
I think I know how it works.

5678
03:58:40,680 --> 03:58:42,500
Now you're into giant magic?

5679
03:58:46,220 --> 03:58:46,860
Oh?

5680
03:58:50,400 --> 03:58:51,040
Oh!

5681
03:58:52,600 --> 03:58:53,240
Watch.

5682
03:58:53,840 --> 03:58:55,780
That's like a little hot air balloon!

5683
03:58:56,740 --> 03:58:57,380
Oh!

5684
03:59:07,070 --> 03:59:08,050
That's cute.

5685
03:59:10,510 --> 03:59:11,750
What did you write?

5686
03:59:13,290 --> 03:59:14,950
I wish mom was here.

5687
03:59:34,020 --> 03:59:35,180
That's fucked man.

5688
03:59:35,280 --> 03:59:36,680
I thought that was a joke.

5689
03:59:42,420 --> 03:59:43,780
Oh, that's fire.

5690
03:59:44,160 --> 03:59:44,680
Okay.

5691
03:59:44,920 --> 03:59:46,440
I didn't worry about...

5692
03:59:46,440 --> 03:59:47,860
Loot, loot, loot.

5693
03:59:48,500 --> 03:59:49,960
Alright, let's see.

5694
03:59:51,340 --> 03:59:52,340
Toki, please.

5695
03:59:53,520 --> 03:59:54,620
Oh, go in there.

5696
03:59:54,740 --> 03:59:55,360
That's it.

5697
03:59:55,700 --> 03:59:57,220
I think that's gonna happen.

5698
03:59:58,120 --> 03:59:58,920
Tunnel boy.

5699
04:00:00,440 --> 04:00:03,300
Wait, he doesn't trust the boy to fucking time this?

5700
04:00:04,120 --> 04:00:05,820
Boy, are you fucking stupid?

5701
04:00:09,880 --> 04:00:12,500
What the fuck?

5702
04:00:12,500 --> 04:00:13,880
The boy should do this too!

5703
04:00:14,180 --> 04:00:14,800
That's not fair!

5704
04:00:15,460 --> 04:00:17,840
If I had to do it, the boy has to do it too.

5705
04:00:19,000 --> 04:00:23,160
Boy, go through this tunnel as well because apparently you're too stupid to time this.

5706
04:00:25,740 --> 04:00:28,500
Alright, let's see.

5707
04:00:28,560 --> 04:00:29,460
Is there anything I'm missing?

5708
04:00:31,200 --> 04:00:31,720
Alright.

5709
04:00:33,240 --> 04:00:37,200
Okay, apparently you can't fucking time this correctly.

5710
04:00:38,640 --> 04:00:39,500
Alright, nice.

5711
04:00:39,940 --> 04:00:41,520
How did you die over here?

5712
04:00:42,140 --> 04:00:44,660
Did you fall on your own sword or some shit?

5713
04:00:47,860 --> 04:00:48,900
This is like baby shit.

5714
04:00:49,140 --> 04:00:49,520
Why am I...

5715
04:00:49,520 --> 04:00:50,060
Oh, hey loot.

5716
04:00:54,820 --> 04:00:55,920
Whoa, what's that?

5717
04:00:58,540 --> 04:00:59,060
Goodbye.

5718
04:00:59,720 --> 04:01:00,240
Goodbye.

5719
04:01:01,540 --> 04:01:02,060
Goodbye.

5720
04:01:04,120 --> 04:01:04,640
Where?

5721
04:01:04,640 --> 04:01:05,640
That's one...

5722
04:01:05,640 --> 04:01:06,580
Wait, how did I get up there?

5723
04:01:07,640 --> 04:01:08,680
Wait, that's loot.

5724
04:01:11,140 --> 04:01:12,420
I don't wanna grab loot.

5725
04:01:14,120 --> 04:01:14,980
Get out.

5726
04:01:15,060 --> 04:01:16,480
Get out of my fucking lobby.

5727
04:01:17,600 --> 04:01:18,900
I'm trying to loot here.

5728
04:01:19,640 --> 04:01:21,480
Oh, this is how you get the loot.

5729
04:01:23,340 --> 04:01:23,860
Oh!

5730
04:01:25,760 --> 04:01:27,420
Where do I lock the mechanism?

5731
04:01:27,920 --> 04:01:28,800
Oh, I don't need to.

5732
04:01:30,560 --> 04:01:31,080
Alright.

5733
04:01:32,600 --> 04:01:33,420
Open chest.

5734
04:01:35,540 --> 04:01:36,060
Yay!

5735
04:01:38,880 --> 04:01:40,640
Steady armor favoring cooldown.

5736
04:01:42,120 --> 04:01:43,100
Do I have that?

5737
04:01:43,360 --> 04:01:43,800
Oh!

5738
04:01:47,160 --> 04:01:47,880
Oh!

5739
04:01:47,880 --> 04:01:49,340
Okay, I'm willing to risk it.

5740
04:01:49,780 --> 04:01:50,500
Oh!

5741
04:01:50,720 --> 04:01:53,140
Reduces all damage from dark elves.

5742
04:01:53,900 --> 04:01:56,540
Grants a blessing on any successful block.

5743
04:01:56,620 --> 04:01:59,560
Very low perk to grant gift when...

5744
04:01:59,560 --> 04:01:59,820
Oh!

5745
04:02:00,820 --> 04:02:02,320
I'll take my chances.

5746
04:02:03,880 --> 04:02:05,040
Alright, nice.

5747
04:02:05,360 --> 04:02:06,040
Okay.

5748
04:02:14,420 --> 04:02:17,360
Alright, hello boy.

5749
04:02:21,740 --> 04:02:23,920
Is there anything above me that I missed?

5750
04:02:24,140 --> 04:02:24,620
No, alright.

5751
04:02:25,660 --> 04:02:26,480
Alright boy, let's go!

5752
04:02:31,640 --> 04:02:32,460
This is stupid.

5753
04:02:32,580 --> 04:02:34,020
He should have done the trials with me.

5754
04:02:34,080 --> 04:02:35,140
It wasn't even that hard.

5755
04:02:38,020 --> 04:02:40,240
Woodoki is like, What is that supposed to mean?

5756
04:02:43,460 --> 04:02:44,280
Bye, Roth.

5757
04:02:46,300 --> 04:02:47,680
What do you mean with my luck?

5758
04:02:48,940 --> 04:02:49,640
Or not.

5759
04:02:49,940 --> 04:02:51,240
Are we still too hesitant?

5760
04:02:53,240 --> 04:02:53,920
Are we?

5761
04:02:54,840 --> 04:02:55,740
What are we missing?

5762
04:02:57,620 --> 04:02:58,400
Let's see.

5763
04:02:59,400 --> 04:03:00,120
Oh, chest!

5764
04:03:02,360 --> 04:03:03,720
Has it really been four hours?

5765
04:03:03,860 --> 04:03:05,420
Okay, this game has been really fun.

5766
04:03:07,580 --> 04:03:08,280
I don't know.

5767
04:03:08,520 --> 04:03:09,680
Did you die of cringe?

5768
04:03:10,020 --> 04:03:10,800
What happened to you?

5769
04:03:11,900 --> 04:03:13,060
What the fuck happened to you?

5770
04:03:13,100 --> 04:03:14,340
Why are you dehydrated?

5771
04:03:16,800 --> 04:03:17,280
Alright.

5772
04:03:17,420 --> 04:03:17,780
Oh,

5773
04:03:22,920 --> 04:03:23,920
rock.

5774
04:03:25,840 --> 04:03:27,060
Alright, goodbye rock.

5775
04:03:30,880 --> 04:03:31,840
Goodbye rock.

5776
04:03:33,400 --> 04:03:34,200
Up we go.

5777
04:03:36,160 --> 04:03:37,320
We should be up here now.

5778
04:03:42,640 --> 04:03:43,960
We're gonna see everything!

5779
04:03:45,180 --> 04:03:46,460
We will see when we get there.

5780
04:03:46,760 --> 04:03:48,540
Until then, eyes open.

5781
04:03:51,400 --> 04:03:51,840
Alright.

5782
04:03:52,540 --> 04:03:54,800
Am I gonna fight a god anytime soon?

5783
04:03:56,540 --> 04:03:57,160
I'm fine.

5784
04:03:57,400 --> 04:03:58,800
Just lost my balance for a moment.

5785
04:03:59,260 --> 04:04:02,360
You know, for someone so strong, you sure worry a lot.

5786
04:04:02,720 --> 04:04:04,020
It serves me well.

5787
04:04:04,180 --> 04:04:05,880
And how I keep us alive.

5788
04:04:06,580 --> 04:04:07,200
I guess.

5789
04:04:07,580 --> 04:04:09,340
Not a terribly fun way to live though.

5790
04:04:16,320 --> 04:04:16,880
What's that?

5791
04:04:17,040 --> 04:04:17,660
Oh shit!

5792
04:04:19,720 --> 04:04:20,200
Okay.

5793
04:04:21,820 --> 04:04:22,780
Oh my god.

5794
04:04:22,920 --> 04:04:23,520
Oh please!

5795
04:04:24,640 --> 04:04:25,480
R3, R3!

5796
04:04:28,080 --> 04:04:29,120
What do you mean?

5797
04:04:29,320 --> 04:04:30,480
I wasn't looking at anything.

5798
04:04:30,480 --> 04:04:34,960
Hahaha I don't know what you're talking about guys.

5799
04:04:35,320 --> 04:04:40,280
Hahaha I was just trying to look at my scenery.

5800
04:04:40,720 --> 04:04:45,640
Hehehehehe I was just looking at the mountains.

5801
04:04:45,760 --> 04:04:47,480
What the fuck are you talking about?

5802
04:04:48,180 --> 04:04:48,500
Hahaha

5803
04:04:53,720 --> 04:04:56,780
Look at that beautiful mountain behind me.

5804
04:04:57,740 --> 04:04:58,720
Oh shit!

5805
04:05:02,400 --> 04:05:02,960
Wait!

5806
04:05:05,180 --> 04:05:06,300
Oh, what?!

5807
04:05:06,300 --> 04:05:08,800
Fuck this, I'm going angry mode.

5808
04:05:09,660 --> 04:05:10,600
I'm angry!

5809
04:05:10,940 --> 04:05:11,760
That's right!

5810
04:05:12,000 --> 04:05:13,080
I'm so angry!

5811
04:05:13,560 --> 04:05:14,780
Oh shit, okay.

5812
04:05:15,020 --> 04:05:16,060
You know what, I'll take those.

5813
04:05:17,600 --> 04:05:19,080
Wait, how am I supposed to...

5814
04:05:20,680 --> 04:05:23,940
I'm too angry to fucking do rage attacks!

5815
04:05:24,580 --> 04:05:25,500
It's not fair!

5816
04:05:28,720 --> 04:05:29,520
Okay, nice.

5817
04:05:29,580 --> 04:05:30,440
And then...

5818
04:05:31,740 --> 04:05:32,960
Get outta here.

5819
04:05:33,260 --> 04:05:35,060
Get the fuck outta here.

5820
04:05:36,470 --> 04:05:37,500
Get the fuck... Oh!

5821
04:05:38,470 --> 04:05:39,420
Get outta here!

5822
04:05:40,000 --> 04:05:41,260
That's fucking right!

5823
04:05:42,880 --> 04:05:44,540
Get out of this lobby!

5824
04:05:47,400 --> 04:05:48,640
Man, angry.

5825
04:05:51,520 --> 04:05:53,160
How do we get out of here?

5826
04:05:54,470 --> 04:05:54,780
Here?

5827
04:05:54,960 --> 04:05:55,140
Oh.

5828
04:05:59,330 --> 04:05:59,950
Oh.

5829
04:06:00,070 --> 04:06:00,950
I just pushed.

5830
04:06:03,310 --> 04:06:03,910
Push.

5831
04:06:04,290 --> 04:06:04,890
Push.

5832
04:06:04,890 --> 04:06:05,190
Push, man.

5833
04:06:10,300 --> 04:06:10,900
Alright.

5834
04:06:12,500 --> 04:06:13,880
Look at that.

5835
04:06:14,860 --> 04:06:15,840
Look at that hole.

5836
04:06:20,960 --> 04:06:21,560
Oh shit!

5837
04:06:30,590 --> 04:06:31,390
It's fine.

5838
04:06:31,590 --> 04:06:32,670
Everything is okay.

5839
04:06:35,350 --> 04:06:37,710
These guys are so fucking weak!

5840
04:06:38,430 --> 04:06:41,490
I don't need to upgrade anything with how weak you are!

5841
04:06:42,450 --> 04:06:43,470
That is HP.

5842
04:06:45,170 --> 04:06:45,650
Oh.

5843
04:06:45,810 --> 04:06:46,290
Oh.

5844
04:06:46,330 --> 04:06:47,130
I took that back.

5845
04:06:47,290 --> 04:06:48,110
I'm so sorry.

5846
04:06:48,210 --> 04:06:49,110
I did not mean to...

5847
04:06:49,910 --> 04:06:51,490
I didn't mean to call you weak!

5848
04:06:51,890 --> 04:06:52,770
I'm so sorry!

5849
04:06:54,010 --> 04:06:55,070
Oh, please!

5850
04:06:55,870 --> 04:06:56,990
Use your wolves!

5851
04:06:58,230 --> 04:07:01,370
What's the point of having wolves if you can't use it?

5852
04:07:03,730 --> 04:07:04,570
Oh shit!

5853
04:07:04,850 --> 04:07:06,290
Where the fuck did you come from?

5854
04:07:08,950 --> 04:07:09,910
Oh, nice!

5855
04:07:10,690 --> 04:07:11,690
Execution time!

5856
04:07:14,330 --> 04:07:15,090
Alright.

5857
04:07:15,630 --> 04:07:16,490
That's right.

5858
04:07:17,970 --> 04:07:18,730
Doki smash!

5859
04:07:19,950 --> 04:07:20,710
Doki smash!

5860
04:07:21,770 --> 04:07:22,950
Where am I?

5861
04:07:23,090 --> 04:07:23,870
Doki smash!

5862
04:07:25,730 --> 04:07:27,070
That's fucking right.

5863
04:07:29,210 --> 04:07:30,870
Wait, you're still alive?

5864
04:07:31,250 --> 04:07:31,670
How?

5865
04:07:35,270 --> 04:07:36,730
What do you mean you're not ready?

5866
04:07:37,450 --> 04:07:37,990
What do you mean you're not ready?

5867
04:07:37,990 --> 04:07:38,090
What do you mean you're not ready?

5868
04:07:38,170 --> 04:07:38,910
Oh, hey.

5869
04:07:39,250 --> 04:07:40,350
Okay, I think he's dead.

5870
04:07:41,430 --> 04:07:41,990
Okay.

5871
04:07:43,470 --> 04:07:44,030
Alright.

5872
04:07:44,470 --> 04:07:45,810
You're actually babies.

5873
04:07:47,350 --> 04:07:48,550
Some more courage.

5874
04:07:48,650 --> 04:07:49,090
Steal.

5875
04:07:49,590 --> 04:07:50,310
Heal us.

5876
04:07:50,650 --> 04:07:51,670
We're stuck again?

5877
04:07:53,110 --> 04:07:54,730
Alright, time to push again.

5878
04:07:57,630 --> 04:07:58,190
Push.

5879
04:07:58,830 --> 04:07:59,790
Doki push.

5880
04:08:01,470 --> 04:08:02,110
Nice.

5881
04:08:02,430 --> 04:08:03,410
Are we there yet?

5882
04:08:04,050 --> 04:08:06,550
How fucking high is this mountain?

5883
04:08:09,530 --> 04:08:11,030
Just enjoying the view.

5884
04:08:15,110 --> 04:08:15,750
Yeah?

5885
04:08:18,470 --> 04:08:20,070
Wait, we're scattering?

5886
04:08:21,350 --> 04:08:23,630
We're doing all this to scatter her ashes?

5887
04:08:24,030 --> 04:08:25,570
I was not paying attention.

5888
04:08:25,630 --> 04:08:26,850
I thought this was important.

5889
04:08:27,250 --> 04:08:27,790
I...

5890
04:08:36,100 --> 04:08:38,500
I thought this was an important mission.

5891
04:08:45,980 --> 04:08:51,190
Oh, we made it!

5892
04:08:57,080 --> 04:08:57,880
Yippee!

5893
04:09:06,180 --> 04:09:08,900
Oh shit, is that a dragon?

5894
04:09:11,100 --> 04:09:12,500
What the fuck?

5895
04:09:15,360 --> 04:09:16,480
That's fucking right.

5896
04:09:17,000 --> 04:09:17,560
Oh!

5897
04:09:17,940 --> 04:09:18,500
Okay.

5898
04:09:18,720 --> 04:09:19,200
Whoops.

5899
04:09:21,920 --> 04:09:22,760
Oh fuck.

5900
04:09:23,320 --> 04:09:23,880
Oh!

5901
04:09:25,040 --> 04:09:25,780
It's okay.

5902
04:09:25,980 --> 04:09:27,440
I never learned my lesson.

5903
04:09:28,100 --> 04:09:28,660
Clearly.

5904
04:09:28,880 --> 04:09:30,060
Oh, I can block it.

5905
04:09:31,000 --> 04:09:32,860
Shoot the fucking hands!

5906
04:09:33,680 --> 04:09:35,540
What are you doing, boy?

5907
04:09:36,040 --> 04:09:37,720
Why are you shooting the head?

5908
04:09:37,960 --> 04:09:38,520
Hahaha.

5909
04:09:38,520 --> 04:09:38,600
Hahaha.

5910
04:09:40,920 --> 04:09:41,560
Hahaha.

5911
04:09:43,100 --> 04:09:44,440
Boy, please.

5912
04:09:44,480 --> 04:09:47,580
He's holding on to our fucking thing.

5913
04:09:51,700 --> 04:09:52,340
Alright.

5914
04:09:52,920 --> 04:09:54,540
Wait, he's breathing electricity.

5915
04:09:54,900 --> 04:09:56,060
That's not a real dragon.

5916
04:09:56,400 --> 04:09:56,920
What are you doing?

5917
04:09:57,260 --> 04:09:58,160
Be ready!

5918
04:09:58,440 --> 04:09:59,660
What the fuck is...

5919
04:10:04,410 --> 04:10:05,370
Bum bum.

5920
04:10:06,070 --> 04:10:06,930
Bum bum.

5921
04:10:10,930 --> 04:10:12,710
What the fuck does he fly?

5922
04:10:12,710 --> 04:10:14,090
He has chicken wings for wings.

5923
04:10:22,100 --> 04:10:23,880
Bro, he doesn't even have wings.

5924
04:10:24,840 --> 04:10:25,380
That was intense.

5925
04:10:27,940 --> 04:10:28,580
Alright.

5926
04:10:30,820 --> 04:10:32,100
Alright, so...

5927
04:10:33,080 --> 04:10:34,060
Can we...

5928
04:10:34,060 --> 04:10:36,260
smash the crystal now?

5929
04:10:38,240 --> 04:10:38,880
Yeah.

5930
04:10:39,520 --> 04:10:43,140
Oh, can we do stuff with the crystal now?

5931
04:10:45,300 --> 04:10:46,640
I guess we can.

5932
04:10:47,060 --> 04:10:48,600
Did we finally learn?

5933
04:10:49,840 --> 04:10:50,560
No.

5934
04:10:50,740 --> 04:10:51,620
We didn't.

5935
04:10:55,540 --> 04:11:00,780
You can destroy it by combating shatter crystals with energy crystals.

5936
04:11:01,100 --> 04:11:03,520
Pull to pick up a shatter crystal.

5937
04:11:04,000 --> 04:11:05,220
And then...

5938
04:11:05,220 --> 04:11:06,220
Oh, is this the rock?

5939
04:11:08,840 --> 04:11:09,560
Oh!

5940
04:11:09,900 --> 04:11:10,620
Incredible!

5941
04:11:13,820 --> 04:11:15,260
Oh, this is how you do it.

5942
04:11:15,800 --> 04:11:17,260
I can't believe we fought a dragon.

5943
04:11:17,820 --> 04:11:20,520
I was aiming for his eyes, but I kept losing my footing.

5944
04:11:20,980 --> 04:11:22,300
Do you think this is their home?

5945
04:11:22,300 --> 04:11:23,640
Oh, you were aiming for the eyes.

5946
04:11:23,740 --> 04:11:25,020
Oh yeah, you're definitely the problem.

5947
04:11:27,760 --> 04:11:29,620
Boy, the air grows thin here.

5948
04:11:29,800 --> 04:11:31,040
No more questions.

5949
04:11:31,480 --> 04:11:32,140
Oh no.

5950
04:11:33,700 --> 04:11:34,580
Oh, yes.

5951
04:11:35,160 --> 04:11:35,800
I see.

5952
04:11:35,900 --> 04:11:37,440
Stop wasting our air, boy.

5953
04:11:39,760 --> 04:11:40,200
Alright.

5954
04:11:40,280 --> 04:11:41,520
We're not dying here.

5955
04:11:44,340 --> 04:11:45,100
What?

5956
04:11:45,200 --> 04:11:46,320
Who's Sindri?

5957
04:11:50,880 --> 04:11:52,120
Who the fuck is Sindri?

5958
04:11:56,820 --> 04:11:57,580
Sindri?

5959
04:11:59,620 --> 04:12:00,940
Is that you?

5960
04:12:08,500 --> 04:12:09,260
Oh!

5961
04:12:09,380 --> 04:12:10,860
The brother that doesn't...

5962
04:12:10,860 --> 04:12:11,340
Sorry.

5963
04:12:11,840 --> 04:12:15,360
He doesn't matter to me.

5964
04:12:15,560 --> 04:12:16,520
Oh, I forgot his name.

5965
04:12:21,200 --> 04:12:24,580
If he's not important, I just don't remember their name.

5966
04:12:26,280 --> 04:12:27,620
He's the corporal.

5967
04:12:27,660 --> 04:12:31,940
He works for CORPA, so I didn't bother to learn.

5968
04:12:35,360 --> 04:12:38,320
Bro, that dwarf's not even gonna fucking feed you.

5969
04:12:38,460 --> 04:12:39,240
He's like a pea.

5970
04:12:41,400 --> 04:12:44,780
He's like a fucking pea for your meal.

5971
04:12:47,500 --> 04:12:49,580
Not even gonna be worth it.

5972
04:12:49,800 --> 04:12:49,880
Not even gonna be worth it.

5973
04:12:50,780 --> 04:12:51,980
Boom, here I go.

5974
04:12:52,460 --> 04:12:52,620
Boom, here I go.

5975
04:12:53,340 --> 04:12:55,280
Boom, here I go.

5976
04:12:55,300 --> 04:12:57,180
He's like one singular pea.

5977
04:12:59,080 --> 04:13:00,200
He's like one singular pea.

5978
04:13:00,200 --> 04:13:00,880
He's on a diet.

5979
04:13:02,180 --> 04:13:03,220
Let's fucking go.

5980
04:13:03,940 --> 04:13:05,900
Oh shit, that looks so sick.

5981
04:13:06,900 --> 04:13:07,460
Get bored.

5982
04:13:16,030 --> 04:13:18,170
Oh, well obviously heavy attack.

5983
04:13:18,330 --> 04:13:19,590
Why the fuck would I ever do life?

5984
04:13:21,970 --> 04:13:22,470
Alright.

5985
04:13:24,450 --> 04:13:25,450
Bad dragon.

5986
04:13:25,650 --> 04:13:26,590
Oh, uh, uh.

5987
04:13:26,690 --> 04:13:27,670
Not a dragon.

5988
04:13:40,620 --> 04:13:41,620
Oh shit.

5989
04:13:42,520 --> 04:13:43,300
Oh fuck.

5990
04:13:43,960 --> 04:13:45,080
What's this weak spot?

5991
04:13:45,980 --> 04:13:47,000
I can't tell.

5992
04:13:48,460 --> 04:13:49,500
Wait, where do I go?

5993
04:13:49,680 --> 04:13:50,240
Oh, oh.

5994
04:13:51,440 --> 04:13:52,340
We're gonna play catch.

5995
04:13:52,880 --> 04:13:53,860
Open your mouth.

5996
04:13:54,840 --> 04:13:55,740
Open your mouth.

5997
04:13:57,780 --> 04:13:58,260
Nice.

5998
04:13:59,280 --> 04:14:00,480
Ow, not nice.

5999
04:14:01,020 --> 04:14:02,500
Ow, not nice.

6000
04:14:02,500 --> 04:14:03,460
What the fuck?

6001
04:14:05,740 --> 04:14:06,220
Alright.

6002
04:14:08,080 --> 04:14:08,560
Oh.

6003
04:14:08,720 --> 04:14:09,320
Did I?

6004
04:14:09,400 --> 04:14:10,340
Yeah, okay, I got it right.

6005
04:14:11,360 --> 04:14:11,840
Okay.

6006
04:14:13,040 --> 04:14:13,920
That's fucking right.

6007
04:14:14,840 --> 04:14:15,780
Wait, how do I?

6008
04:14:17,000 --> 04:14:17,180
Where?

6009
04:14:17,620 --> 04:14:18,500
Oh, there!

6010
04:14:20,000 --> 04:14:20,540
Yeah!

6011
04:14:22,600 --> 04:14:23,140
Alright.

6012
04:14:23,740 --> 04:14:24,720
I made a hole.

6013
04:14:27,200 --> 04:14:28,080
Oh shit.

6014
04:14:29,200 --> 04:14:30,720
Okay, I gotta pick this up.

6015
04:14:31,460 --> 04:14:32,700
Oh, wait, ow!

6016
04:14:33,280 --> 04:14:34,220
That's not fair.

6017
04:14:38,220 --> 04:14:39,300
Okay, we're...

6018
04:14:39,300 --> 04:14:40,360
We're...

6019
04:14:40,360 --> 04:14:41,180
Oh, ow.

6020
04:14:41,360 --> 04:14:42,840
Okay, that's not fair as well.

6021
04:14:43,520 --> 04:14:44,620
The fuck do I?

6022
04:14:47,320 --> 04:14:48,260
Open your mouth!

6023
04:14:49,200 --> 04:14:50,100
Open your mouth!

6024
04:14:51,420 --> 04:14:52,540
God damn it!

6025
04:14:53,300 --> 04:14:55,080
Why don't you open your mouth?

6026
04:14:55,320 --> 04:14:56,080
I'm gonna fucking...

6027
04:14:56,680 --> 04:14:57,620
Shoot your...

6028
04:14:57,620 --> 04:14:59,980
Okay, nevermind.

6029
04:15:00,700 --> 04:15:02,020
I'm gonna hit your toes.

6030
04:15:03,720 --> 04:15:04,760
Okay, nevermind.

6031
04:15:04,860 --> 04:15:06,260
No toe hitting, I guess.

6032
04:15:07,800 --> 04:15:09,240
Oh, I can block stomps!

6033
04:15:09,280 --> 04:15:09,480
Okay.

6034
04:15:12,220 --> 04:15:13,000
Okay, nice.

6035
04:15:14,280 --> 04:15:15,780
I guess I'm just gonna...

6036
04:15:16,340 --> 04:15:17,720
I'm just gonna get your toes.

6037
04:15:20,220 --> 04:15:22,560
I guess, fuck your toes, I guess.

6038
04:15:22,820 --> 04:15:23,260
I guess, fuck your toes, I guess.

6039
04:15:23,260 --> 04:15:23,740
I guess, fuck your toes, I guess.

6040
04:15:24,140 --> 04:15:24,700
Oh?

6041
04:15:26,660 --> 04:15:28,160
Did I block that?

6042
04:15:31,660 --> 04:15:32,660
Alright, nice.

6043
04:15:33,020 --> 04:15:33,800
Wait, no?

6044
04:15:34,400 --> 04:15:35,380
That's not fair!

6045
04:15:38,560 --> 04:15:39,120
What?

6046
04:15:42,340 --> 04:15:42,900
What?

6047
04:15:43,020 --> 04:15:44,080
Oh, it's the toes again!

6048
04:15:44,400 --> 04:15:46,280
Oh, it's the toes again!

6049
04:15:49,790 --> 04:15:50,510
Is it?

6050
04:15:50,550 --> 04:15:51,190
Is it just the toes?

6051
04:15:52,410 --> 04:15:53,310
Stupid toe...

6052
04:15:53,310 --> 04:15:53,390
Oh!

6053
04:15:54,070 --> 04:15:57,570
Guys, I can't tell.

6054
04:15:58,650 --> 04:16:01,450
I can't tell if it's the toes or not.

6055
04:16:01,550 --> 04:16:02,490
No, please!

6056
04:16:02,670 --> 04:16:05,130
Why do you have to block my own knees?

6057
04:16:05,610 --> 04:16:06,710
Oh, here we go.

6058
04:16:08,390 --> 04:16:09,370
Boy, please.

6059
04:16:09,710 --> 04:16:11,970
I'm just trying to grab this.

6060
04:16:12,870 --> 04:16:15,010
I'm just trying to grab it.

6061
04:16:15,250 --> 04:16:16,350
I'm just trying to grab it.

6062
04:16:16,350 --> 04:16:16,850
Please.

6063
04:16:19,630 --> 04:16:20,550
Okay, nice.

6064
04:16:20,550 --> 04:16:20,850
Okay, nice.

6065
04:16:21,500 --> 04:16:22,050
Got it.

6066
04:16:24,250 --> 04:16:25,210
I got it.

6067
04:16:28,150 --> 04:16:28,910
It's fine.

6068
04:16:29,500 --> 04:16:31,050
Might as well just do that.

6069
04:16:31,290 --> 04:16:31,630
Ow.

6070
04:16:33,690 --> 04:16:35,730
Okay, I need all the HP I can get.

6071
04:16:35,790 --> 04:16:36,310
Are you serious?

6072
04:16:36,490 --> 04:16:38,050
I totally fucking blocked that.

6073
04:16:41,750 --> 04:16:42,510
Fuck you.

6074
04:16:43,330 --> 04:16:44,790
Oh shit, I'm sorry.

6075
04:16:44,790 --> 04:16:45,690
I did not mean that.

6076
04:16:45,770 --> 04:16:46,670
I did not mean that.

6077
04:16:47,350 --> 04:16:53,270
I did not mean that.

6078
04:16:53,350 --> 04:16:53,930
I'm sorry.

6079
04:16:54,150 --> 04:16:55,130
I blocked that.

6080
04:16:55,270 --> 04:16:56,350
What are you talking about?

6081
04:16:57,190 --> 04:16:59,150
I totally blocked that.

6082
04:17:00,510 --> 04:17:02,170
This is bullshit.

6083
04:17:05,630 --> 04:17:07,250
Oh, come on!

6084
04:17:09,050 --> 04:17:10,230
Guys, I don't...

6085
04:17:12,770 --> 04:17:13,410
Oh.

6086
04:17:13,410 --> 04:17:14,070
Oh, no.

6087
04:17:14,150 --> 04:17:15,010
No, no, no!

6088
04:17:15,130 --> 04:17:15,450
No!

6089
04:17:21,580 --> 04:17:22,720
Oh my god.

6090
04:17:23,060 --> 04:17:25,500
Why is this dragon so buff?

6091
04:17:27,280 --> 04:17:29,180
Bro, fuck you and your claws.

6092
04:17:30,420 --> 04:17:31,500
Oh shit.

6093
04:17:35,250 --> 04:17:35,890
What?

6094
04:17:40,510 --> 04:17:42,370
Okay, I have to... I'm just gonna run.

6095
04:17:42,370 --> 04:17:43,270
I'm just gonna run.

6096
04:17:45,930 --> 04:17:46,350
Okay.

6097
04:17:46,490 --> 04:17:46,790
No!

6098
04:17:47,970 --> 04:17:49,290
This is... Is it not...

6099
04:17:49,290 --> 04:17:50,350
Dark Souls?

6100
04:17:50,570 --> 04:17:53,650
Is there no invisibility?

6101
04:17:56,950 --> 04:17:57,530
Oh, okay.

6102
04:17:57,670 --> 04:17:58,090
Stop.

6103
04:17:59,090 --> 04:17:59,510
Okay.

6104
04:17:59,510 --> 04:18:00,090
We're fine.

6105
04:18:03,110 --> 04:18:03,530
Okay.

6106
04:18:04,090 --> 04:18:05,410
Does he use electricity now?

6107
04:18:05,510 --> 04:18:06,030
Okay, nice.

6108
04:18:06,530 --> 04:18:06,950
Alright.

6109
04:18:07,110 --> 04:18:08,290
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

6110
04:18:09,050 --> 04:18:09,470
No!

6111
04:18:09,470 --> 04:18:12,130
Why is he on the fucking zap?

6112
04:18:14,010 --> 04:18:14,850
Fuck you!

6113
04:18:15,950 --> 04:18:16,790
Fuck you!

6114
04:18:18,050 --> 04:18:18,870
There you go.

6115
04:18:20,310 --> 04:18:21,590
No, he's on it.

6116
04:18:21,690 --> 04:18:22,950
I can't do anything about it.

6117
04:18:25,490 --> 04:18:26,410
Fuck you.

6118
04:18:27,030 --> 04:18:27,630
Alright.

6119
04:18:29,290 --> 04:18:29,890
Nice.

6120
04:18:32,670 --> 04:18:33,270
Please!

6121
04:18:33,510 --> 04:18:34,110
Die!

6122
04:18:34,390 --> 04:18:34,990
Please!

6123
04:18:42,280 --> 04:18:42,880
Alright.

6124
04:18:43,620 --> 04:18:44,780
Okay, he's gone now.

6125
04:18:45,260 --> 04:18:46,560
Okay, he's not gone.

6126
04:18:48,620 --> 04:18:49,600
Yes, eat them!

6127
04:18:49,740 --> 04:18:50,360
Not me!

6128
04:18:55,750 --> 04:18:57,870
Be ready to lower the crane on my...

6129
04:18:59,250 --> 04:19:00,890
I don't know how this thing works!

6130
04:19:01,070 --> 04:19:01,770
I do not care!

6131
04:19:02,130 --> 04:19:03,010
Be ready!

6132
04:19:04,050 --> 04:19:04,490
Ow!

6133
04:19:04,490 --> 04:19:05,270
I fucked up.

6134
04:19:05,650 --> 04:19:06,230
Fuck this.

6135
04:19:06,430 --> 04:19:08,690
I'm gonna punch... I'm gonna punch your toes!

6136
04:19:09,610 --> 04:19:10,510
I don't care!

6137
04:19:10,550 --> 04:19:11,570
I'm gonna punch your toes!

6138
04:19:12,610 --> 04:19:13,490
Okay, guys.

6139
04:19:13,830 --> 04:19:16,410
Guys, I'm just... I should have not used that to punch you.

6140
04:19:16,430 --> 04:19:21,710
I should have not used that to punch you.

6141
04:19:21,930 --> 04:19:22,410
No!

6142
04:19:28,710 --> 04:19:29,350
Okay.

6143
04:19:29,670 --> 04:19:30,530
I'm learning!

6144
04:19:31,390 --> 04:19:32,270
I'm learning!

6145
04:19:34,210 --> 04:19:36,310
I... I am attempting to learn!

6146
04:19:38,490 --> 04:19:39,170
I... I am attempting to learn!

6147
04:19:43,880 --> 04:19:44,820
Get down.

6148
04:19:45,660 --> 04:19:47,240
Get down, Mr. President!

6149
04:19:47,420 --> 04:19:47,960
Get down!

6150
04:19:49,920 --> 04:19:50,460
Ow!

6151
04:19:51,460 --> 04:19:52,000
Okay.

6152
04:19:54,380 --> 04:19:55,180
We're fine!

6153
04:19:55,640 --> 04:19:56,860
We're so fine!

6154
04:19:58,160 --> 04:19:59,100
Oh, here.

6155
04:20:00,260 --> 04:20:01,840
Oh, I can ride the dragon!

6156
04:20:03,520 --> 04:20:04,060
Oh,

6157
04:20:08,950 --> 04:20:08,950
I can ride the dragon!

6158
04:20:08,950 --> 04:20:10,150
That's fucking right!

6159
04:20:10,490 --> 04:20:10,550
That's fucking right!

6160
04:20:15,300 --> 04:20:17,120
Quick time, quick time, quick time!

6161
04:20:18,460 --> 04:20:19,000
Oh!

6162
04:20:27,500 --> 04:20:28,460
Oh, shit!

6163
04:20:28,820 --> 04:20:28,900
Oh, shit!

6164
04:20:28,900 --> 04:20:28,900
Oh,

6165
04:20:42,030 --> 04:20:42,030
shit!

6166
04:20:42,030 --> 04:20:44,090
And thus, all dragons are now extinct.

6167
04:20:45,050 --> 04:20:47,570
Oh, shit!

6168
04:20:47,570 --> 04:20:49,310
Watch the blood get absorbed into my skin.

6169
04:20:50,310 --> 04:20:51,750
Watch the blood get absorbed into my skin.

6170
04:20:51,750 --> 04:20:52,410
And you!

6171
04:20:52,970 --> 04:20:57,250
But, but, but... Nobody's killed a dragon for hundreds of years!

6172
04:20:57,630 --> 04:20:59,390
Not since the grand culling of the worms.

6173
04:20:59,530 --> 04:21:02,390
And unless I'm mistaken, you did all that for me!

6174
04:21:03,370 --> 04:21:04,570
You are mistaken.

6175
04:21:04,910 --> 04:21:07,050
And the blood is gone now.

6176
04:21:07,050 --> 04:21:09,830
You deny it all you want.

6177
04:21:09,910 --> 04:21:10,930
But you saved me.

6178
04:21:11,050 --> 04:21:11,730
And that...

6179
04:21:11,730 --> 04:21:12,370
A free upgrade?

6180
04:21:16,630 --> 04:21:17,490
What are these?

6181
04:21:17,990 --> 04:21:19,250
Braided mistletoe arrows.

6182
04:21:19,530 --> 04:21:21,470
Straighter than Heimdall and perfectly weighted.

6183
04:21:21,590 --> 04:21:23,450
I thought they were celery, not gonna lie.

6184
04:21:29,190 --> 04:21:32,230
Have you seen my brother again?

6185
04:21:33,290 --> 04:21:33,770
Yeah.

6186
04:21:33,930 --> 04:21:35,310
He said you lost your talent.

6187
04:21:35,310 --> 04:21:37,810
Oh, and that I'm selfish?

6188
04:21:38,030 --> 04:21:38,310
No.

6189
04:21:38,470 --> 04:21:39,070
I'm sure.

6190
04:21:39,190 --> 04:21:40,590
That I value a weapon's look?

6191
04:21:40,770 --> 04:21:41,050
No.

6192
04:21:41,110 --> 04:21:42,010
Over its purpose.

6193
04:21:42,250 --> 04:21:43,230
That I'm pretentious?

6194
04:21:43,370 --> 04:21:43,690
No.

6195
04:21:43,890 --> 04:21:44,510
And I'm tight.

6196
04:21:44,790 --> 04:21:45,230
Fussy.

6197
04:21:45,450 --> 04:21:47,910
I know what he thinks, but he can't hurt me any...

6198
04:21:47,910 --> 04:21:49,070
Why the fuck do you have a fish?

6199
04:21:49,990 --> 04:21:50,570
Burn that.

6200
04:21:52,410 --> 04:21:54,350
I do not have time for this.

6201
04:21:54,610 --> 04:21:56,310
No, no, no, no, no.

6202
04:21:56,330 --> 04:21:57,570
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

6203
04:21:59,090 --> 04:22:00,230
I have a better idea.

6204
04:22:00,750 --> 04:22:01,190
What?

6205
04:22:01,550 --> 04:22:03,610
I just need a tooth from that dragon.

6206
04:22:07,730 --> 04:22:08,750
I mean, he's dead.

6207
04:22:09,690 --> 04:22:10,090
I mean, he's dead.

6208
04:22:15,040 --> 04:22:18,400
Oh my god, think about all the weapons you can make out of this dragon.

6209
04:22:19,720 --> 04:22:20,520
What's the...

6210
04:22:20,520 --> 04:22:21,880
I can't believe it.

6211
04:22:21,940 --> 04:22:23,300
Father just killed a dragon.

6212
04:22:23,600 --> 04:22:25,320
I've never seen him fight like that before.

6213
04:22:25,600 --> 04:22:28,580
I mean, I know he's really strong and all, but that thing was huge.

6214
04:22:29,660 --> 04:22:31,600
I mean, he can't even fucking fly.

6215
04:22:32,120 --> 04:22:33,120
He had chicken wings.

6216
04:22:35,660 --> 04:22:36,640
Oh, that's his name?

6217
04:22:36,640 --> 04:22:37,560
Crazzler?

6218
04:22:39,480 --> 04:22:40,040
Alright.

6219
04:22:55,980 --> 04:22:57,980
I might as well be able to...

6220
04:22:57,980 --> 04:23:00,600
I should be able to farm this entire dragon.

6221
04:23:01,440 --> 04:23:04,380
I mean, this looks like a very old dragon.

6222
04:23:05,040 --> 04:23:08,100
Imagine all the equipment I can make out of this guy.

6223
04:23:08,360 --> 04:23:08,620
Imagine all the equipment I can make out of this guy.

6224
04:23:09,140 --> 04:23:11,860
I should make my entire armor as dragon.

6225
04:23:12,620 --> 04:23:14,160
I've seen Monster Hunter.

6226
04:23:14,460 --> 04:23:16,980
This is like literally a whole new armor set.

6227
04:23:17,400 --> 04:23:17,460
This is like literally a whole new armor set.

6228
04:23:18,640 --> 04:23:20,000
Only one tooth?

6229
04:23:20,400 --> 04:23:21,660
This is fucking bullshit.

6230
04:23:23,080 --> 04:23:23,720
Angry.

6231
04:23:27,980 --> 04:23:28,540
Yeah.

6232
04:23:29,500 --> 04:23:30,920
I am not touching that.

6233
04:23:31,080 --> 04:23:32,620
Just hold it out.

6234
04:23:32,840 --> 04:23:33,220
Huh?

6235
04:23:37,380 --> 04:23:37,940
What?

6236
04:23:40,520 --> 04:23:43,480
Now, run that along the string of your son's bow.

6237
04:23:45,420 --> 04:23:47,480
Oh, he has the sap thing.

6238
04:23:51,360 --> 04:23:52,760
Atreus, your bow.

6239
04:23:53,840 --> 04:23:55,260
Give me your magic bow.

6240
04:23:57,560 --> 04:23:59,000
Two passes should do it.

6241
04:24:00,880 --> 04:24:02,760
Ah, gently now.

6242
04:24:03,140 --> 04:24:03,780
Oh.

6243
04:24:06,060 --> 04:24:08,620
Now I can destroy the red walls.

6244
04:24:13,140 --> 04:24:15,820
I have to like swap in between them?

6245
04:24:16,140 --> 04:24:16,860
Oh, sure.

6246
04:24:17,020 --> 04:24:17,800
Now you're impressed.

6247
04:24:23,280 --> 04:24:23,630
Nice.

6248
04:24:26,190 --> 04:24:29,130
How do I swap?

6249
04:24:29,410 --> 04:24:29,430
How do I swap?

6250
04:24:29,890 --> 04:24:30,890
Oh, okay.

6251
04:24:31,150 --> 04:24:31,830
Oh.

6252
04:24:32,330 --> 04:24:34,010
I see.

6253
04:24:35,490 --> 04:24:35,930
Alright.

6254
04:24:36,070 --> 04:24:36,730
Let's see.

6255
04:24:36,770 --> 04:24:37,730
I should be able to...

6256
04:24:37,730 --> 04:24:38,250
Wait, no.

6257
04:24:38,310 --> 04:24:38,930
Upgrade my shit.

6258
04:24:40,430 --> 04:24:41,890
I have rare items.

6259
04:24:42,690 --> 04:24:43,130
Oh.

6260
04:24:43,650 --> 04:24:44,090
Okay.

6261
04:24:44,690 --> 04:24:45,130
Upgrade.

6262
04:24:47,430 --> 04:24:47,870
Alright.

6263
04:24:47,990 --> 04:24:49,030
And then...

6264
04:24:50,310 --> 04:24:51,210
I think it's...

6265
04:24:51,210 --> 04:24:52,390
I can upgrade his bow too.

6266
04:24:52,490 --> 04:24:52,690
Yeah.

6267
04:24:52,690 --> 04:24:53,490
Upgrade.

6268
04:24:55,210 --> 04:24:55,890
Okay.

6269
04:24:57,430 --> 04:24:58,110
Nice.

6270
04:24:59,230 --> 04:25:00,870
And then that's all I have to do.

6271
04:25:01,530 --> 04:25:02,390
No more.

6272
04:25:03,330 --> 04:25:04,890
That means I have...

6273
04:25:04,890 --> 04:25:06,050
skills now.

6274
04:25:06,250 --> 04:25:06,850
Right?

6275
04:25:08,670 --> 04:25:09,350
Uh...

6276
04:25:09,350 --> 04:25:09,830
Oh.

6277
04:25:13,170 --> 04:25:14,530
Shock duration.

6278
04:25:15,690 --> 04:25:16,370
Canal.

6279
04:25:17,390 --> 04:25:18,730
It's like greater amount.

6280
04:25:19,070 --> 04:25:19,670
Do I want shock?

6281
04:25:19,670 --> 04:25:22,470
Is shock better than light?

6282
04:25:23,250 --> 04:25:23,810
Is shock better than light?

6283
04:25:28,040 --> 04:25:29,680
Okay, I'm gonna get these though.

6284
04:25:33,600 --> 04:25:34,840
It's like a stun.

6285
04:25:35,200 --> 04:25:35,740
Okay.

6286
04:25:37,780 --> 04:25:38,340
Oh.

6287
04:25:39,600 --> 04:25:40,720
It's situational.

6288
04:25:40,880 --> 04:25:41,440
Okay.

6289
04:25:42,120 --> 04:25:43,820
Alright, now I'm gonna focus on me.

6290
04:25:47,280 --> 04:25:48,860
That's enough for me to know.

6291
04:25:49,360 --> 04:25:50,900
I'm gonna focus on me.

6292
04:25:53,120 --> 04:25:54,400
On the second...

6293
04:25:55,200 --> 04:25:55,760
Uh...

6294
04:25:58,400 --> 04:25:58,960
Uh...

6295
04:26:00,900 --> 04:26:01,460
Uh...

6296
04:26:01,460 --> 04:26:06,100
While barehanded, aim and press to instantly recall and perform... Oh!

6297
04:26:07,040 --> 04:26:07,600
Okay.

6298
04:26:08,760 --> 04:26:10,640
I don't know, honestly.

6299
04:26:13,280 --> 04:26:14,920
It is objectively better?

6300
04:26:15,140 --> 04:26:16,360
Okay, then I guess I'll...

6301
04:26:16,360 --> 04:26:17,400
I'll try it out.

6302
04:26:17,520 --> 04:26:19,040
I'll upgrade some shock just in case.

6303
04:26:19,680 --> 04:26:20,240
Alright.

6304
04:26:20,900 --> 04:26:21,580
Alright, boy.

6305
04:26:22,660 --> 04:26:24,820
I'm gonna test your shock skills out.

6306
04:26:25,300 --> 04:26:26,780
Now we fought dark elves.

6307
04:26:30,520 --> 04:26:31,120
Oh!

6308
04:26:31,420 --> 04:26:32,340
I feel like we could be anything.

6309
04:26:32,880 --> 04:26:34,980
We win because we are determined.

6310
04:26:35,780 --> 04:26:36,380
Disciplined.

6311
04:26:36,580 --> 04:26:38,860
Not because we feel ourselves superior.

6312
04:26:39,720 --> 04:26:40,100
Sure.

6313
04:26:42,770 --> 04:26:43,970
Light runic.

6314
04:26:46,530 --> 04:26:47,270
What's that?

6315
04:26:47,710 --> 04:26:48,310
Oh!

6316
04:26:49,510 --> 04:26:50,110
Wait.

6317
04:26:50,110 --> 04:26:51,090
No, that doesn't...

6318
04:26:51,090 --> 04:26:51,750
That doesn't matter.

6319
04:26:51,750 --> 04:26:53,570
At one, that's four damage.

6320
04:26:53,650 --> 04:26:54,630
And two stun.

6321
04:26:55,630 --> 04:26:57,030
Alright, up we go, boy.

6322
04:26:57,670 --> 04:26:59,150
I wanna test out your shock.

6323
04:27:02,070 --> 04:27:03,690
I don't know what the shock is like.

6324
04:27:07,070 --> 04:27:08,270
Up we go.

6325
04:27:09,290 --> 04:27:10,630
I can't believe it, guys.

6326
04:27:10,950 --> 04:27:13,290
Now, we're at 10% of the story.

6327
04:27:18,130 --> 04:27:18,830
Oh, what?

6328
04:27:19,770 --> 04:27:20,590
Oh, shit!

6329
04:27:23,790 --> 04:27:24,570
Oh!

6330
04:27:24,950 --> 04:27:25,170
Oh!

6331
04:27:25,650 --> 04:27:27,110
Okay, light...

6332
04:27:27,110 --> 04:27:27,810
Wait, what?

6333
04:27:30,710 --> 04:27:31,970
What the fuck?

6334
04:27:35,610 --> 04:27:36,530
What the?

6335
04:27:38,470 --> 04:27:39,250
Oh!

6336
04:27:41,270 --> 04:27:42,510
That was crazy.

6337
04:27:44,270 --> 04:27:45,590
What the fuck?

6338
04:27:48,680 --> 04:27:50,820
Yeah, he regen super fast.

6339
04:27:53,720 --> 04:27:55,140
And make them stronger.

6340
04:27:56,000 --> 04:27:56,660
Wait, what?

6341
04:27:58,400 --> 04:28:00,060
Yeah, that shit went so fast.

6342
04:28:02,400 --> 04:28:04,300
I don't even know how the fuck to...

6343
04:28:05,440 --> 04:28:06,520
I had to like...

6344
04:28:06,520 --> 04:28:09,540
I had to like fucking, uh...

6345
04:28:11,980 --> 04:28:12,640
Wait, what?

6346
04:28:12,920 --> 04:28:13,380
Yeah.

6347
04:28:14,540 --> 04:28:15,000
Oh!

6348
04:28:15,780 --> 04:28:16,740
Okay, up we go.

6349
04:28:19,860 --> 04:28:20,320
Alright.

6350
04:28:22,100 --> 04:28:22,980
It's time to shoot.

6351
04:28:24,940 --> 04:28:25,620
Oh, nice.

6352
04:28:27,080 --> 04:28:27,560
Okay.

6353
04:28:27,560 --> 04:28:29,540
I want to test your shock skills out.

6354
04:28:31,340 --> 04:28:31,820
Alright.

6355
04:28:31,920 --> 04:28:32,420
Do it again!

6356
04:28:32,920 --> 04:28:33,940
Do it again, boy!

6357
04:28:35,140 --> 04:28:35,620
Alright.

6358
04:28:35,840 --> 04:28:36,880
It's not so bad.

6359
04:28:37,760 --> 04:28:39,260
The shock is not that bad.

6360
04:28:40,720 --> 04:28:42,160
The stun is really good.

6361
04:28:44,100 --> 04:28:46,140
Okay, so stun a possessed enemy.

6362
04:28:46,380 --> 04:28:46,660
Okay.

6363
04:28:46,720 --> 04:28:48,560
I just need to stun it and then...

6364
04:28:49,480 --> 04:28:49,960
Uh...

6365
04:28:50,960 --> 04:28:51,720
And then...

6366
04:28:51,720 --> 04:28:53,000
And then I should kill it.

6367
04:28:53,120 --> 04:28:54,440
I just won by brute forcing.

6368
04:28:54,620 --> 04:28:54,780
Oh!

6369
04:28:57,680 --> 04:28:58,080
Nice.

6370
04:29:00,200 --> 04:29:00,600
Alright.

6371
04:29:02,040 --> 04:29:03,020
No, no, no, no, no.

6372
04:29:03,060 --> 04:29:03,560
You're not getting...

6373
04:29:03,560 --> 04:29:03,680
No!

6374
04:29:04,900 --> 04:29:05,680
God damn it.

6375
04:29:08,180 --> 04:29:08,680
It's fine.

6376
04:29:09,820 --> 04:29:10,520
Oh, what?

6377
04:29:10,560 --> 04:29:11,440
Oh shit, I forgot!

6378
04:29:12,760 --> 04:29:14,660
I forgot this shit doesn't...

6379
04:29:15,360 --> 04:29:16,620
I have to use my arms.

6380
04:29:16,920 --> 04:29:18,300
I forgot what that was like.

6381
04:29:21,160 --> 04:29:23,900
I forgot what it was like to use my arms.

6382
04:29:24,380 --> 04:29:24,860
I forgot what it was like to use my arms.

6383
04:29:24,860 --> 04:29:26,560
I haven't done that in so long.

6384
04:29:27,180 --> 04:29:27,380
I haven't done that in so long.

6385
04:29:29,220 --> 04:29:29,700
Alright.

6386
04:29:30,300 --> 04:29:30,980
Let's see.

6387
04:29:31,160 --> 04:29:32,420
I got all my HP back though.

6388
04:29:35,060 --> 04:29:35,640
What's this?

6389
04:29:37,740 --> 04:29:38,220
So...

6390
04:29:38,220 --> 04:29:38,900
Oh my god.

6391
04:29:39,760 --> 04:29:42,380
There's so many buttons to pay attention to now.

6392
04:29:43,740 --> 04:29:45,500
I'm getting a little bit overwhelmed.

6393
04:29:46,020 --> 04:29:47,500
I'm going to forget all these moves.

6394
04:29:48,440 --> 04:29:49,860
100% chat.

6395
04:29:54,110 --> 04:29:55,090
Let me see.

6396
04:29:55,490 --> 04:29:55,790
Let me see.

6397
04:29:57,570 --> 04:29:58,170
What?

6398
04:30:01,590 --> 04:30:02,190
Wait.

6399
04:30:02,570 --> 04:30:04,390
Get to this area though.

6400
04:30:04,690 --> 04:30:04,990
Get to this area though.

6401
04:30:05,070 --> 04:30:06,830
I guess it's on the other side?

6402
04:30:10,910 --> 04:30:12,330
I guess it's on the other side?

6403
04:30:14,690 --> 04:30:15,510
Doesn't matter.

6404
04:30:16,310 --> 04:30:17,670
Doesn't matter.

6405
04:30:19,410 --> 04:30:21,110
Wait, what the fuck?

6406
04:30:22,670 --> 04:30:23,610
Can I stun him?

6407
04:30:24,230 --> 04:30:24,730
Okay.

6408
04:30:27,590 --> 04:30:28,330
Okay, nice.

6409
04:30:29,530 --> 04:30:30,810
Oh, I can't block that.

6410
04:30:30,970 --> 04:30:32,290
What the fuck happened?

6411
04:30:37,550 --> 04:30:38,050
Okay.

6412
04:30:39,190 --> 04:30:42,750
Maybe I shouldn't have interrupted their prayer session.

6413
04:30:49,580 --> 04:30:50,620
Okay, but what if?

6414
04:30:54,700 --> 04:30:55,560
Oh shit.

6415
04:30:55,660 --> 04:30:56,360
Oh shit.

6416
04:30:56,500 --> 04:30:57,080
I'm sorry.

6417
04:30:57,080 --> 04:30:57,800
It was a joke.

6418
04:30:58,740 --> 04:31:00,280
Okay, but what if though?

6419
04:31:02,060 --> 04:31:02,740
It's fine.

6420
04:31:03,160 --> 04:31:03,900
What is he going to do?

6421
04:31:03,920 --> 04:31:04,440
Kill me?

6422
04:31:07,180 --> 04:31:07,800
It's fine.

6423
04:31:07,880 --> 04:31:10,440
If I don't touch him, he can't kill me.

6424
04:31:11,760 --> 04:31:12,200
See?

6425
04:31:14,060 --> 04:31:15,120
Oh, I have the wolves.

6426
04:31:16,040 --> 04:31:17,280
The wolves are so strong.

6427
04:31:19,160 --> 04:31:19,760
Oh my god.

6428
04:31:19,780 --> 04:31:20,760
Look how strong it is.

6429
04:31:21,840 --> 04:31:22,280
Okay.

6430
04:31:22,280 --> 04:31:23,040
We got this.

6431
04:31:24,380 --> 04:31:24,820
See?

6432
04:31:24,820 --> 04:31:25,260
Easy.

6433
04:31:25,280 --> 04:31:26,300
I told you.

6434
04:31:27,080 --> 04:31:27,500
Oh no.

6435
04:31:27,620 --> 04:31:28,100
Oh no.

6436
04:31:28,200 --> 04:31:28,460
I'm sorry.

6437
04:31:31,740 --> 04:31:32,180
Easy.

6438
04:31:32,620 --> 04:31:32,960
See?

6439
04:31:33,100 --> 04:31:33,960
I told you guys.

6440
04:31:35,220 --> 04:31:36,100
So easy.

6441
04:31:40,730 --> 04:31:41,170
What?

6442
04:31:41,170 --> 04:31:42,510
I thought I heard something.

6443
04:31:43,170 --> 04:31:43,610
Okay.

6444
04:31:46,550 --> 04:31:46,990
Oh.

6445
04:31:48,870 --> 04:31:49,890
That breaks this, right?

6446
04:31:49,950 --> 04:31:50,170
Yes.

6447
04:31:50,890 --> 04:31:52,070
Oh, it was all for lore?

6448
04:31:58,470 --> 04:31:59,950
I think I was too young.

6449
04:32:00,810 --> 04:32:03,150
Are giants coming out of his armpits?

6450
04:32:03,270 --> 04:32:03,750
What?

6451
04:32:05,710 --> 04:32:06,510
What the fuck?

6452
04:32:06,870 --> 04:32:07,810
I think it might be Odin stabbing him.

6453
04:32:08,930 --> 04:32:09,950
What the fuck?

6454
04:32:10,670 --> 04:32:11,410
What the?

6455
04:32:12,150 --> 04:32:13,030
Try this, Liv.

6456
04:32:14,390 --> 04:32:14,870
What?

6457
04:32:16,050 --> 04:32:17,250
What is this story?

6458
04:32:18,370 --> 04:32:18,970
What the?

6459
04:32:19,710 --> 04:32:20,330
What's that?

6460
04:32:22,610 --> 04:32:24,170
Okay, I need to know this story.

6461
04:32:27,470 --> 04:32:28,430
Okay, I need to know this story.

6462
04:32:28,430 --> 04:32:29,550
Why is there maggots?

6463
04:32:32,110 --> 04:32:32,750
Okay.

6464
04:32:35,030 --> 04:32:36,630
Alright, we found one of it.

6465
04:32:38,990 --> 04:32:39,630
Alright.

6466
04:32:40,190 --> 04:32:41,390
That's a fetish right there.

6467
04:32:43,330 --> 04:32:43,970
Okay.

6468
04:32:46,210 --> 04:32:47,730
Missing two more.

6469
04:32:51,310 --> 04:32:52,690
Where's the last two?

6470
04:32:54,370 --> 04:32:55,750
That's a wild story.

6471
04:32:56,170 --> 04:32:57,310
Yeah, I was like, what the fuck?

6472
04:33:01,410 --> 04:33:02,790
Where's the last two?

6473
04:33:03,590 --> 04:33:04,310
Where's the last two?

6474
04:33:08,680 --> 04:33:12,020
Okay, so we got one of the shrines there.

6475
04:33:12,360 --> 04:33:13,200
Okay, so we got one of the shrines there.

6476
04:33:13,200 --> 04:33:15,880
We're literally missing one, two more.

6477
04:33:16,300 --> 04:33:16,320
We're literally missing one, two more.

6478
04:33:17,060 --> 04:33:18,080
Where do I go?

6479
04:33:20,060 --> 04:33:21,220
Do I hit that?

6480
04:33:23,040 --> 04:33:23,700
Oh!

6481
04:33:28,420 --> 04:33:29,080
Phew!

6482
04:33:31,240 --> 04:33:32,460
Is that it?

6483
04:33:33,400 --> 04:33:34,600
And then...

6484
04:33:34,600 --> 04:33:35,440
Phew!

6485
04:33:37,720 --> 04:33:38,640
I did it!

6486
04:33:38,720 --> 04:33:40,680
I will never get tired of shattering things with this.

6487
04:33:41,000 --> 04:33:42,000
You're so smart!

6488
04:33:45,200 --> 04:33:46,140
Oh god, no!

6489
04:33:46,220 --> 04:33:46,720
Oh no!

6490
04:33:48,860 --> 04:33:49,940
It's okay, I'm stronger!

6491
04:33:50,500 --> 04:33:51,580
Oh, where's my axe?

6492
04:33:54,260 --> 04:33:56,760
You can't regen if I'm stronger!

6493
04:33:58,420 --> 04:33:59,620
That's fucking right!

6494
04:34:01,000 --> 04:34:01,520
Nice.

6495
04:34:01,920 --> 04:34:03,400
Oh my god, another one?

6496
04:34:04,480 --> 04:34:05,640
That takes care of that.

6497
04:34:06,500 --> 04:34:06,980
And then...

6498
04:34:06,980 --> 04:34:09,240
We gotta grab another...

6499
04:34:10,120 --> 04:34:11,540
You gotta grab another one.

6500
04:34:12,500 --> 04:34:13,600
Alright, here we go.

6501
04:34:16,020 --> 04:34:16,620
And...

6502
04:34:16,620 --> 04:34:17,960
Oh, there's...

6503
04:34:17,960 --> 04:34:18,540
There it is!

6504
04:34:21,200 --> 04:34:21,800
Yeah.

6505
04:34:21,980 --> 04:34:22,940
Let me grab that too.

6506
04:34:23,800 --> 04:34:24,400
Reading!

6507
04:34:25,000 --> 04:34:26,540
Oh shit, not reading!

6508
04:34:27,640 --> 04:34:28,480
Get down!

6509
04:34:28,800 --> 04:34:30,120
Gotta swat some mosquitoes.

6510
04:34:32,080 --> 04:34:32,680
What?

6511
04:34:33,600 --> 04:34:34,040
What?

6512
04:34:36,220 --> 04:34:37,220
Why did I hear...

6513
04:34:37,220 --> 04:34:37,920
I heard something.

6514
04:34:38,960 --> 04:34:39,540
Oh well.

6515
04:34:41,320 --> 04:34:41,760
Read.

6516
04:34:43,640 --> 04:34:44,720
Where's the last shrine?

6517
04:34:45,920 --> 04:34:46,360
Interesting.

6518
04:34:51,260 --> 04:34:52,200
Yeah, what does it say?

6519
04:34:54,660 --> 04:34:55,100
Okay.

6520
04:34:55,860 --> 04:34:57,520
Don't talk to your father, I guess.

6521
04:34:59,220 --> 04:35:00,460
Alright, that was too long.

6522
04:35:00,580 --> 04:35:01,100
You're right, maybe.

6523
04:35:03,720 --> 04:35:06,660
You made a good choice not teaching me what that said.

6524
04:35:08,960 --> 04:35:09,560
Alright.

6525
04:35:10,200 --> 04:35:11,620
Maybe the shrine's here?

6526
04:35:14,400 --> 04:35:15,920
Okay, there is a chest.

6527
04:35:22,810 --> 04:35:24,310
He's not dead!

6528
04:35:27,110 --> 04:35:28,330
Get out of here!

6529
04:35:29,170 --> 04:35:30,390
That's fucking right.

6530
04:35:30,970 --> 04:35:32,090
Give me that loot.

6531
04:35:34,250 --> 04:35:34,850
Alright.

6532
04:35:35,430 --> 04:35:35,990
And...

6533
04:35:35,990 --> 04:35:36,490
Phew!

6534
04:35:38,410 --> 04:35:40,370
Okay, now how do I get back?

6535
04:35:40,630 --> 04:35:40,810
Oh!

6536
04:35:41,190 --> 04:35:42,170
I just jump.

6537
04:35:42,470 --> 04:35:43,030
Nice.

6538
04:35:43,790 --> 04:35:45,950
And then the chest is open.

6539
04:35:53,790 --> 04:35:54,350
Yay!

6540
04:35:54,550 --> 04:35:55,350
More HP!

6541
04:35:55,970 --> 04:35:56,230
Yeah.

6542
04:35:58,770 --> 04:35:59,330
Okay.

6543
04:36:00,930 --> 04:36:01,490
Uh...

6544
04:36:04,840 --> 04:36:06,120
Guess we go this way.

6545
04:36:07,060 --> 04:36:08,620
Please let me out of this cave.

6546
04:36:08,620 --> 04:36:11,440
Please, I just want to spread my dead white ashes.

6547
04:36:11,880 --> 04:36:12,380
Please.

6548
04:36:14,120 --> 04:36:15,480
That's all I want.

6549
04:36:16,720 --> 04:36:20,660
I've been trying to climb up this fucking mountain for 20 years.

6550
04:36:26,500 --> 04:36:27,700
Fucking finally!

6551
04:36:28,560 --> 04:36:30,060
Am I at the top?

6552
04:36:31,900 --> 04:36:32,580
Please!

6553
04:36:32,680 --> 04:36:34,740
How far am I to the summit?

6554
04:36:35,940 --> 04:36:37,060
Your quiver.

6555
04:36:37,480 --> 04:36:39,100
Strap broke when we fought the dragon.

6556
04:36:39,720 --> 04:36:40,480
It's alright.

6557
04:36:40,700 --> 04:36:42,280
I finally made it!

6558
04:36:43,500 --> 04:36:50,980
I swear to god, if a fucking another dragon comes over and knocks the only pathway to the summit, I swear to fucking god.

6559
04:36:51,160 --> 04:36:55,020
I so- Broken quiver will slow your draw.

6560
04:36:55,980 --> 04:36:57,180
Pain we endure.

6561
04:36:57,940 --> 04:36:59,520
Faulty weaponry we do not.

6562
04:37:01,420 --> 04:37:02,540
This will do for now.

6563
04:37:03,640 --> 04:37:04,200
Good?

6564
04:37:05,000 --> 04:37:06,060
I swear to god.

6565
04:37:06,300 --> 04:37:07,340
We're so close.

6566
04:37:07,720 --> 04:37:09,880
I just want to spread dead ashes.

6567
04:37:10,100 --> 04:37:13,540
I killed a million people today.

6568
04:37:14,140 --> 04:37:17,820
And I just want to fucking spread my dead white ashes.

6569
04:37:18,080 --> 04:37:19,100
That's all I want.

6570
04:37:20,120 --> 04:37:21,760
And also beat up some jars.

6571
04:37:22,880 --> 04:37:25,160
But other than that, that's literally all I want.

6572
04:37:27,480 --> 04:37:28,040
Alright.

6573
04:37:28,880 --> 04:37:29,680
Go through.

6574
04:37:29,860 --> 04:37:30,820
You first, boy!

6575
04:37:32,060 --> 04:37:33,060
Boy, you first!

6576
04:37:35,380 --> 04:37:36,500
Boy, you first!

6577
04:37:37,980 --> 04:37:38,460
Alright!

6578
04:37:39,300 --> 04:37:39,780
Wow!

6579
04:37:40,400 --> 04:37:44,620
Look at this long ass fucking- Wow!

6580
04:37:44,940 --> 04:37:47,460
I wonder what's gonna happen in this long fucking corridor.

6581
04:37:49,600 --> 04:37:50,540
Alright, get down.

6582
04:37:52,800 --> 04:37:53,560
Alright, nice.

6583
04:37:55,480 --> 04:37:56,240
Oh man!

6584
04:37:56,700 --> 04:37:58,940
I wonder what's gonna fucking happen!

6585
04:37:59,420 --> 04:38:01,060
Oh wait, is this a- Okay, yeah.

6586
04:38:01,280 --> 04:38:02,320
Alright, give me a sec.

6587
04:38:02,320 --> 04:38:03,440
I gotta beat you up with my hands.

6588
04:38:04,100 --> 04:38:05,780
I keep forgetting what that is like.

6589
04:38:07,460 --> 04:38:08,060
Alright.

6590
04:38:12,120 --> 04:38:12,720
Alright.

6591
04:38:12,840 --> 04:38:13,020
Alright.

6592
04:38:13,740 --> 04:38:14,560
Off we go.

6593
04:38:15,280 --> 04:38:17,060
We're getting so close.

6594
04:38:17,500 --> 04:38:20,360
We're getting so close to the end!

6595
04:38:23,280 --> 04:38:27,360
We're getting so close to spreading my wife's ashes!

6596
04:38:29,800 --> 04:38:31,280
Alright, here we go.

6597
04:38:31,280 --> 04:38:33,000
We're at the final stretch!

6598
04:38:33,160 --> 04:38:35,700
Wouldn't it be funny if it collapses?

6599
04:38:36,440 --> 04:38:37,600
Wouldn't it be funny if it collapses?

6600
04:38:40,520 --> 04:38:41,560
Where's the door?

6601
04:38:43,260 --> 04:38:44,240
Hidden man?

6602
04:38:47,540 --> 04:38:49,320
Wife, who is this hidden man?

6603
04:38:50,860 --> 04:38:51,500
Wife, who is this hidden man?

6604
04:38:51,740 --> 04:38:52,780
Dead wife.

6605
04:38:53,400 --> 04:38:57,820
Why did you- Were you trying to tell me there was another man?

6606
04:39:00,560 --> 04:39:02,880
What do you mean hidden man?

6607
04:39:03,220 --> 04:39:04,940
You hear those voices too, right?

6608
04:39:05,200 --> 04:39:05,720
Yes.

6609
04:39:05,860 --> 04:39:06,700
Be silent.

6610
04:39:07,840 --> 04:39:09,180
What do you mean?

6611
04:39:09,600 --> 04:39:11,300
Who is this hidden man?

6612
04:39:12,640 --> 04:39:14,880
That sounds like the same man who came to our house.

6613
04:39:15,060 --> 04:39:16,260
You said you killed him.

6614
04:39:16,480 --> 04:39:17,360
Wait, what?

6615
04:39:19,260 --> 04:39:24,380
It must be important that the sons of Thor deign to grace me with their presence.

6616
04:39:24,380 --> 04:39:25,600
Tell me.

6617
04:39:25,740 --> 04:39:28,900
You two still tripping over yourselves to Is he a tree?

6618
04:39:29,340 --> 04:39:33,260
The tattooed man tracks show he now travels with a child.

6619
04:39:33,500 --> 04:39:34,740
Where would they go next?

6620
04:39:35,980 --> 04:39:37,640
Why would I know that?

6621
04:39:38,680 --> 04:39:41,160
You the smartest man alive, aren't you?

6622
04:39:41,900 --> 04:39:43,020
There's three men?

6623
04:39:45,560 --> 04:39:48,200
You help me, I help you.

6624
04:39:48,360 --> 04:39:51,760
Tell me where they are, and I'll talk to Odin.

6625
04:39:51,980 --> 04:39:55,360
Your father won't let me go bald out and he won't let you kill me.

6626
04:39:55,460 --> 04:39:58,340
You have nothing to offer me, so take the question.

6627
04:39:58,460 --> 04:40:03,680
Take these two worthless wankers and piss off.

6628
04:40:04,380 --> 04:40:05,020
Damn.

6629
04:40:06,560 --> 04:40:07,980
When no one's looking.

6630
04:40:08,220 --> 04:40:09,540
I thought this was Norse.

6631
04:40:09,540 --> 04:40:10,440
Why is he British?

6632
04:40:11,260 --> 04:40:12,140
Don't you forget.

6633
04:40:24,680 --> 04:40:26,220
Why is he Scottish?

6634
04:40:31,740 --> 04:40:33,020
Oh, Balder!

6635
04:40:35,060 --> 04:40:35,700
Okay.

6636
04:40:37,140 --> 04:40:38,760
How is Balder over there?

6637
04:40:42,320 --> 04:40:42,940
Alright.

6638
04:40:44,480 --> 04:40:45,860
We go down.

6639
04:40:49,790 --> 04:40:51,010
And up we go.

6640
04:40:53,750 --> 04:40:54,950
Up we go.

6641
04:40:55,330 --> 04:40:55,950
Please.

6642
04:40:56,190 --> 04:41:00,050
The moment I spread these ashes, I'm fucking ending stream for today.

6643
04:41:03,710 --> 04:41:04,330
Whoa!

6644
04:41:04,610 --> 04:41:06,130
Very topic of conversation.

6645
04:41:06,730 --> 04:41:09,410
A tattooed man traveling with a child.

6646
04:41:11,370 --> 04:41:12,510
Boy took their path.

6647
04:41:12,710 --> 04:41:13,710
Make sure we're all alone.

6648
04:41:13,790 --> 04:41:14,970
But we just saw them leave.

6649
04:41:15,110 --> 04:41:15,710
Do as I say.

6650
04:41:18,390 --> 04:41:19,970
He doesn't know what you are.

6651
04:41:20,730 --> 04:41:22,270
And I would keep it that way.

6652
04:41:23,470 --> 04:41:24,430
Who are you?

6653
04:41:24,670 --> 04:41:24,990
Me?

6654
04:41:25,830 --> 04:41:30,570
I'm the greatest ambassador to the gods, the giants, and all the creatures of the nine realms.

6655
04:41:31,210 --> 04:41:35,810
I know every corner of these lands, every language spoken, every war waged, every deal struck.

6656
04:41:36,110 --> 04:41:37,690
They call me Mimir!

6657
04:41:38,530 --> 04:41:39,010
Mimir?

6658
04:41:39,950 --> 04:41:42,910
And I have the answer to every question.

6659
04:41:44,070 --> 04:41:46,090
Why does the son of Odin haunt us?

6660
04:41:48,350 --> 04:41:50,450
Okay, there are a few gaps in my knowledge.

6661
04:41:51,670 --> 04:41:55,550
But Odin's had me imprisoned here for 109 years.

6662
04:41:55,570 --> 04:41:59,150
I'm the smartest man alive, but like 109 years ago.

6663
04:41:59,390 --> 04:41:59,890
I'll piece it together.

6664
04:42:00,110 --> 04:42:00,890
I promise.

6665
04:42:01,630 --> 04:42:02,430
Given time.

6666
04:42:02,690 --> 04:42:04,850
So like what happened in the last 109 years?

6667
04:42:05,230 --> 04:42:05,990
Just like I said.

6668
04:42:07,690 --> 04:42:09,050
The boy's mother is dead.

6669
04:42:09,450 --> 04:42:14,070
She wanted us to spread her ashes on the highest peak in all the realms.

6670
04:42:14,130 --> 04:42:15,870
Is this not the highest peak?

6671
04:42:15,990 --> 04:42:17,970
Are you fucking kidding me?

6672
04:42:20,050 --> 04:42:21,130
It's in Yot-9.

6673
04:42:22,090 --> 04:42:25,250
Why did you say that?

6674
04:42:26,550 --> 04:42:27,190
No!

6675
04:42:31,470 --> 04:42:33,790
This is not the highest peak!

6676
04:42:34,370 --> 04:42:36,510
Are you fucking kidding me?

6677
04:42:37,690 --> 04:42:39,750
Why did I have to ask him that?

6678
04:42:40,490 --> 04:42:42,570
Looks like a giant's fingers scrape in the sky.

6679
04:42:42,770 --> 04:42:44,770
That's the highest peak in all the realms.

6680
04:42:45,110 --> 04:42:48,970
Maybe she went the highest peak in Midgard.

6681
04:42:49,570 --> 04:42:54,230
When the giants destroyed all other bridges to their realm, they locked this one up with a secret rune.

6682
04:42:54,350 --> 04:42:57,150
If it still exists, only a giant would know it.

6683
04:42:57,210 --> 04:42:59,430
Princess, the peak is at another castle.

6684
04:43:01,130 --> 04:43:02,890
Boy, why did you ask that?

6685
04:43:03,610 --> 04:43:04,130
Why?

6686
04:43:04,130 --> 04:43:04,850
It's a vortex of coincidence.

6687
04:43:05,410 --> 04:43:06,250
It is.

6688
04:43:06,790 --> 04:43:10,170
There's only one person alive who can get you where you need to go.

6689
04:43:10,570 --> 04:43:14,490
And luckily for you, my schedule's wide open.

6690
04:43:18,880 --> 04:43:20,120
Spread the ashes.

6691
04:43:20,440 --> 04:43:21,220
She's dead.

6692
04:43:21,280 --> 04:43:22,760
She doesn't fucking care.

6693
04:43:25,400 --> 04:43:26,980
She's already dead.

6694
04:43:27,040 --> 04:43:28,120
She won't know.

6695
04:43:30,140 --> 04:43:32,040
This is just symbolic.

6696
04:43:32,960 --> 04:43:35,920
We can just pretend this is the highest peak.

6697
04:43:36,600 --> 04:43:37,300
Wait, what?

6698
04:43:38,060 --> 04:43:39,320
She'll never know!

6699
04:43:39,880 --> 04:43:42,280
Not even Thor's hammer could free my body from these bonds.

6700
04:43:42,600 --> 04:43:44,600
But fortunately, you don't need my body.

6701
04:43:44,880 --> 04:43:49,400
The trick is, we need to find someone who can reanimate my head using the old magic.

6702
04:43:49,840 --> 04:43:51,360
Am I cutting his head off?

6703
04:43:52,040 --> 04:43:53,120
Here's a witch of the woods.

6704
04:43:53,380 --> 04:43:54,540
She knows the old ways.

6705
04:43:54,680 --> 04:43:55,220
And she'll help.

6706
04:43:55,260 --> 04:43:56,400
She might do worth a try.

6707
04:43:56,560 --> 04:43:58,000
But if she fails, he will be dead.

6708
04:43:59,880 --> 04:44:01,220
He tortures me, you know.

6709
04:44:02,280 --> 04:44:02,700
What?

6710
04:44:02,920 --> 04:44:03,480
Every day, brother.

6711
04:44:05,380 --> 04:44:07,560
Wouldn't himself cease to hate personally and believe me?

6712
04:44:08,720 --> 04:44:10,720
There is no end to his creativity.

6713
04:44:12,100 --> 04:44:14,880
Every single day.

6714
04:44:15,040 --> 04:44:16,040
Oh, that's fucked.

6715
04:44:16,520 --> 04:44:17,060
This.

6716
04:44:18,640 --> 04:44:19,920
This isn't living.

6717
04:44:23,730 --> 04:44:24,310
Damn.

6718
04:44:24,950 --> 04:44:26,350
Oh, I can't watch this.

6719
04:44:26,610 --> 04:44:27,130
Oh!

6720
04:44:29,630 --> 04:44:31,330
He's gonna meme her forever.

6721
04:44:32,550 --> 04:44:35,210
In case she can't resurrect me, there's something you need to know.

6722
04:44:36,410 --> 04:44:36,990
Boy.

6723
04:44:38,310 --> 04:44:41,210
The longer you wait to tell him his true nature, the more damage you do.

6724
04:44:41,290 --> 04:44:43,610
He will resent you and you may lose him forever.

6725
04:44:43,790 --> 04:44:44,210
Okay.

6726
04:44:44,590 --> 04:44:48,110
He fucking threw...

6727
04:44:48,110 --> 04:44:49,610
He fucking killed a dragon.

6728
04:44:49,790 --> 04:44:51,410
He's not a normal human being.

6729
04:44:52,150 --> 04:44:53,370
Your son knows.

6730
04:44:53,470 --> 04:44:54,410
There's no way.

6731
04:44:55,670 --> 04:44:56,350
He literally

6732
04:45:01,170 --> 04:45:06,370
watched me fucking destroy a dragon.

6733
04:45:06,590 --> 04:45:07,710
How does he not know?

6734
04:45:08,950 --> 04:45:10,770
How the fuck does he not know?

6735
04:45:13,930 --> 04:45:14,990
I don't know.

6736
04:45:14,990 --> 04:45:18,750
Fucking push the giant ass How do you not know, boy?

6737
04:45:19,210 --> 04:45:21,370
Have you never seen another man before?

6738
04:45:22,130 --> 04:45:24,270
Are you...

6739
04:45:24,270 --> 04:45:25,690
Oh my god.

6740
04:45:27,450 --> 04:45:28,170
Why?

6741
04:45:28,490 --> 04:45:30,050
Why did you have to...

6742
04:45:30,050 --> 04:45:31,330
Why can't you lie?

6743
04:45:32,710 --> 04:45:34,790
Why can't you lie?

6744
04:45:34,790 --> 04:45:35,530
Why?

6745
04:45:37,950 --> 04:45:39,810
I don't understand.

6746
04:45:41,110 --> 04:45:47,190
Why can't you lie to this boy and be like this is the highest peak in the world.

6747
04:45:47,730 --> 04:45:49,630
That's all you had to do.

6748
04:45:51,790 --> 04:45:54,310
That's literally all you had to do.

6749
04:45:56,590 --> 04:45:59,930
I killed so many people to just be up here.

6750
04:46:01,630 --> 04:46:04,430
Boy was homeschooled and has some knowledge.

6751
04:46:05,370 --> 04:46:07,670
Thank you for the super chat.

6752
04:46:07,790 --> 04:46:08,270
Thank you.

6753
04:46:08,290 --> 04:46:08,990
Thank you.

6754
04:46:09,550 --> 04:46:11,290
I don't understand.

6755
04:46:13,330 --> 04:46:16,310
I thought I could spread my ashes.

6756
04:46:20,650 --> 04:46:22,270
Oh there it is.

6757
04:46:22,370 --> 04:46:24,390
That's where we killed her fucking best friend.

6758
04:46:29,650 --> 04:46:32,690
Does he think all men can fucking do that?

6759
04:46:34,790 --> 04:46:35,770
Oh okay.

6760
04:46:37,650 --> 04:46:39,890
We updated the map.

6761
04:46:41,190 --> 04:46:42,730
Oh is this the fast pass?

6762
04:46:49,360 --> 04:46:50,120
Alright.

6763
04:46:51,140 --> 04:46:52,940
Where do we have to go?

6764
04:46:54,040 --> 04:46:54,800
Here.

6765
04:46:56,580 --> 04:46:57,860
Jesus Christ.

6766
04:46:57,920 --> 04:46:58,340
Okay.

6767
04:47:00,580 --> 04:47:02,040
We're calling in here.

6768
04:47:02,220 --> 04:47:04,060
I don't fucking care.

6769
04:47:05,920 --> 04:47:07,680
I'm calling in here.

6770
04:47:08,740 --> 04:47:09,500
I'm calling in here.

6771
04:47:09,520 --> 04:47:10,580
I can't.

6772
04:47:12,640 --> 04:47:14,380
I can't keep going.

6773
04:47:18,700 --> 04:47:19,740
I can't.

6774
04:47:20,220 --> 04:47:21,380
I'm done.

6775
04:47:22,560 --> 04:47:23,660
I don't care.

6776
04:47:24,040 --> 04:47:25,140
I don't care.

6777
04:47:25,180 --> 04:47:28,040
We don't get to spread my dead wife's ashes.

6778
04:47:28,240 --> 04:47:29,220
I'm fucking tired.

6779
04:47:31,940 --> 04:47:34,160
I remember I was like I'm just gonna play for it.

6780
04:47:34,200 --> 04:47:35,720
I'm gonna play for a little bit.

6781
04:47:35,720 --> 04:47:36,840
I'm not gonna do too darn today.

6782
04:47:37,300 --> 04:47:38,860
Oh it's fun.

6783
04:47:39,840 --> 04:47:41,940
I had a lot of fun playing it today.

6784
04:47:42,480 --> 04:47:45,700
At least I climbed the highest mountain in Midgard.

6785
04:47:47,060 --> 04:47:49,040
She didn't even specify.

6786
04:47:49,640 --> 04:47:51,660
All she wanted was the highest point.

6787
04:47:51,920 --> 04:47:55,220
She never specified what kind of highest.

6788
04:47:55,340 --> 04:47:56,000
That's the thing.

6789
04:47:57,880 --> 04:48:01,700
Why does the boy have to be so fucking precise?

6790
04:48:02,460 --> 04:48:05,120
She was like I just want me to spread to the highest peak.

6791
04:48:05,720 --> 04:48:08,140
She never said exactly be like highest peak of all.

6792
04:48:08,240 --> 04:48:09,580
She said all the realms.

6793
04:48:09,880 --> 04:48:11,240
That fucking bitch.

6794
04:48:14,180 --> 04:48:14,940
God.

6795
04:48:16,760 --> 04:48:17,920
You're dead.

6796
04:48:18,120 --> 04:48:20,400
You should not be making any demands.

6797
04:48:21,380 --> 04:48:23,440
You're fucking dead.

6798
04:48:25,440 --> 04:48:26,840
So demanding.

6799
04:48:27,600 --> 04:48:30,840
Even in the afterlife she's so fucking demanding.

6800
04:48:33,760 --> 04:48:35,660
Oh my god.

6801
04:48:37,260 --> 04:48:37,820
Anyway.

6802
04:48:38,680 --> 04:48:41,560
It's only 25 hours to beat the game.

6803
04:48:41,680 --> 04:48:43,500
Just 20 more hours to go.

6804
04:48:43,640 --> 04:48:44,700
We can do it.

6805
04:48:44,780 --> 04:48:45,420
Thank you.

6806
04:48:47,080 --> 04:48:48,640
I'm gonna call it here everybody.

6807
04:48:49,260 --> 04:48:50,380
Yes she's dead.

6808
04:48:50,900 --> 04:48:52,780
Why is she making demands on me?

6809
04:48:54,060 --> 04:48:55,320
She'll never know.

6810
04:48:58,160 --> 04:48:59,080
What's she gonna do?

6811
04:48:59,260 --> 04:49:00,020
Haunt me?

6812
04:49:00,200 --> 04:49:02,320
Too bad I'm a fucking Yeah haunt me?

6813
04:49:02,420 --> 04:49:04,640
Too bad I'm a fucking god of war.

6814
04:49:05,720 --> 04:49:08,200
I killed my first wife and my daughter.

6815
04:49:08,460 --> 04:49:10,840
You haunting me is not gonna do much.

6816
04:49:10,960 --> 04:49:11,960
I'm already haunted.

6817
04:49:12,300 --> 04:49:16,920
You can't make it even more haunted.

6818
04:49:17,000 --> 04:49:18,120
I'm already haunted.

6819
04:49:18,460 --> 04:49:19,320
I'm already cursed.

6820
04:49:19,660 --> 04:49:21,060
You can't double curse me.

6821
04:49:23,520 --> 04:49:25,900
I've already maxed out my trauma.

6822
04:49:31,900 --> 04:49:32,440
Like...

6823
04:49:32,440 --> 04:49:35,680
Like oh but then when you die you gotta deal with her.

6824
04:49:35,780 --> 04:49:36,620
I can't die.

6825
04:49:36,740 --> 04:49:37,640
I'm a fucking god.

6826
04:49:37,980 --> 04:49:39,280
I live forever.

6827
04:49:39,860 --> 04:49:40,760
It doesn't matter.

6828
04:49:41,680 --> 04:49:42,220
Alright.

6829
04:49:43,660 --> 04:49:44,960
I'm gonna call it here everybody.

6830
04:49:45,240 --> 04:49:46,680
I had a great time playing it though.

6831
04:49:46,920 --> 04:49:50,000
It is definitely a really... I've been enjoying this game a lot.

6832
04:49:50,240 --> 04:49:50,780
Honestly.

6833
04:49:52,200 --> 04:49:57,880
So time really does pass by super fast when playing this game and I've definitely been enjoying it a lot.

6834
04:49:58,200 --> 04:50:00,340
It took a while for my brain to get started.

6835
04:50:00,500 --> 04:50:02,960
I was just saying random shit as I went along.

6836
04:50:04,760 --> 04:50:11,920
My brain was like... was like a fucking like... like you're trying to rev up the car and it's like... it's like locked out.

6837
04:50:14,340 --> 04:50:15,440
It's just like...

6838
04:50:15,440 --> 04:50:17,040
It's like not starting.

6839
04:50:17,180 --> 04:50:18,380
That was my brain today.

6840
04:50:18,900 --> 04:50:22,060
But the longer we went the further we got.

6841
04:50:24,520 --> 04:50:25,400
Anyway guys.

6842
04:50:26,020 --> 04:50:28,340
I'm gonna call it here as always everybody.

6843
04:50:28,560 --> 04:50:29,440
Stay hydrated.

6844
04:50:29,800 --> 04:50:30,420
Posture check.

6845
04:50:30,500 --> 04:50:31,660
Get up and move around.

6846
04:50:32,120 --> 04:50:36,940
Get that blood flowing and except for me head to bed cause you deserve it.

6847
04:50:37,020 --> 04:50:38,040
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

6848
04:50:38,500 --> 04:50:39,260
Bye guys.

6849
04:50:40,120 --> 04:50:40,560
Bye.

6850
04:50:43,200 --> 04:50:44,100
Where's the ending screen?

6851
04:50:44,220 --> 04:50:44,720
Oh there it is.

6852
04:50:44,940 --> 04:50:45,380
Bye.
