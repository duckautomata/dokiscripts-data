1
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,220
Okay.

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:09,640
Okay.

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,380
Alright.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,860
This is gonna be interesting.

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,220
Also, hello everyone!

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,760
Hello, Lieutenant, Deadpool, Sayori, Maple, Skulltaker, Dylan...

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,400
Oh, who else?

8
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:23,820
Who else?

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,160
Who else?

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,200
I think Renner.

11
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,420
Alright, hey guys.

12
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:26,820
Okay.

13
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:31,420
This is gonna be an interesting chat, because I've never played Portal before.

14
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,180
Oh, my god!

15
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:34,820
Esini.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Thank you so much for the- for the- Oh shit!

17
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,280
Oh, I knew I forgot something.

18
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,280
I forgot to add my alert box!

19
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,080
Look, I told you this is Scuffed, okay?!

20
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,000
Alright, let me replay this.

21
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,900
I forgot about my alert box!

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,420
I'm like, I must be missing something here, right?

23
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,640
I'm missing something, right?

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,620
And it's my alert box?!

25
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:55,700
Woo!

26
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,400
Can we get some Berk Nights, real quick?

27
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,120
For, um, Esini.

28
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,400
For the 55 007 king.

29
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,180
The tier 1 sub for 5 months.

30
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,940
Also, break nights for Lieutenant too.

31
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,200
Holy shit, okay, I don't know if I should play music.

32
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,280
Should I play music in the background?

33
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,320
Um... for this chat?

34
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,380
Cause, uh...

35
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,460
Uh, this is what we hear.

36
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,200
Like, damn.

37
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,220
Do I play music in the background?

38
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,080
I don't know if it'll like, fuck up the immersion or whatever.

39
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,360
Alright, alright, alright.

40
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:29,820
New game.

41
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,500
Chapter 1.

42
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,060
Alright, I've never played Portal before, so...

43
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,700
Portal soundtrack kinda slaps?

44
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,360
Alright, alright.

45
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,020
Alright guys, I guess you can backseat game.

46
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,140
Uh, cause I'll be so fucking embarrassed.

47
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,840
Trying to figure shit out.

48
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,340
And then I'll be like, oh I can play right now?

49
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,880
How do I pick shit up?

50
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,140
Oh.

51
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,460
Can I pick shit up?

52
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,160
Oh shit, I can walk.

53
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,600
Okay, I can jump.

54
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:54,980
Alright.

55
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,340
Alright.

56
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,340
I'm learning?

57
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:01,820
Oh my god.

58
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:10,760
Oh my god, Rancid can we...

59
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,620
Can we socialize with the tier 1 19 ones?

60
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,480
Okay, I'm just listening real quick.

61
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,080
Can we get some break?

62
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,180
Can I do a quick for Rancid?

63
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,100
Let's listen to some class.

64
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,880
Am I zoomed in?

65
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,220
Oh shit, I got pfft!

66
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,180
Why is my game so zoomed in?

67
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,160
I'm so scuffed.

68
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,500
I was like, oh my god.

69
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,540
Why is this so zoomed in?

70
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,580
Okay, that makes sense.

71
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,780
I was like, damn, what the fuck is wrong with my game?

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,880
What the fuck?

73
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,240
Alright, everything is...

74
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,420
Alright, alright, alright.

75
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,520
Here we go.

76
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,240
Here we go.

77
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,740
Professional streamer.

78
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,860
Professional streamer.

79
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:57,940
What?

80
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:58,360
What?

81
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,260
Is there subtitles?

82
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,920
Hello, Zark!

83
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,680
Oh, is the chat going to be full of intervention?

84
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,120
Oh shit, is that me?

85
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:15,830
Okay.

86
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,270
I got this chat.

87
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,230
I got this.

88
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,890
I got this.

89
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,030
Can I run?

90
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,200
Oh, is this the companion queue?

91
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,180
Oh.

92
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,040
Excuse me.

93
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,460
Excuse me.

94
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:40,980
Excuse me?

95
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,320
Are you kidding me?

96
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:45,840
Okay, there, there.

97
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,840
Apparently I am not very good at physics.

98
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:57,440
Alright, first puzzle.

99
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,420
First puzzle is done.

100
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,240
We did it.

101
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:01,760
First puzzle.

102
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,060
I'm so smart.

103
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,660
I passed level one.

104
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,140
This is so sad.

105
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,020
Yes, please clap for me.

106
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,980
Oh my god, you're so smart.

107
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,740
Doki, you're so fucking smart.

108
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:14,280
Wow.

109
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,840
You did it.

110
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,920
Thank you, thank you guys.

111
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,460
I think I know.

112
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,800
I know, I'm very smart.

113
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,920
I'm very smart.

114
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,860
God, it's so embarrassing.

115
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:30,060
Place the weighted storage cube on the 1500 megawatt Aperture Science Heavy Duty Super Colliding Super Button.

116
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,860
You put that cube...

117
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,560
I know, right?

118
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,120
Shit.

119
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,620
Who else could do that?

120
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,180
Not your... only me.

121
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,100
Oh, okay, here.

122
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:38,760
Oh.

123
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,190
Oh, what?

124
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:56,030
What?

125
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,570
Let me in!

126
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,270
Oh, okay.

127
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:04,530
Oh!

128
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,350
Is this timed?

129
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,830
It's timed, right?

130
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,370
Oh, gotcha.

131
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,430
Perfect.

132
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,370
Please move quickly to the chamber lock.

133
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:20,410
As the effects of prolonged exposure to the ground and... Is this the user one brings us?

134
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,290
Okay, it's timed.

135
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:24,950
Okay, okay.

136
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:25,830
I'm slowly learning.

137
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,930
I'm slowly learning the mechanics.

138
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,270
It has to defy physics and force the camp through...

139
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,930
I didn't... I thought it was a glitch, okay?

140
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,330
I didn't...

141
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,330
I thought it was a glitch.

142
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,630
Is there bee hopping here?

143
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:45,210
I'm bee hopping.

144
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,640
Very slowly, very slowly.

145
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,620
Hey, Tsuna!

146
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,640
I'm trying to learn right now.

147
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,340
It's a...

148
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,860
It's like...

149
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,780
It's technically an FPS...

150
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,340
Oh, shit, really?

151
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:09,280
It's not part of any test protocol, but it should already be a guide.

152
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,540
Oh, my god!

153
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,840
I actually don't know how to bee hop.

154
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,400
I...

155
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:17,720
I...

156
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,540
Oh, you're enjoying Portal?

157
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,320
I did!

158
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,440
I got past level one!

159
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,660
It's apparently very hard, from what my chat told me.

160
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,020
Level one is very...

161
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:25,860
It's a very hard game.

162
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:31,820
Oh!

163
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,900
Okay, I got the portal done.

164
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,680
No, I've never played Half-Life.

165
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,780
I think I... I've not played a lot of games.

166
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,260
Only till I joke and pass Level...

167
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,280
This game will make you grow wrinkles.

168
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,160
Oh, my god.

169
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:53,760
I'm so sorry.

170
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,700
Roy!

171
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,440
Thanks so much for the tier three!

172
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,380
Eight months!

173
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,100
Can I get some Park Night's real quick for Roy?

174
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:06,900
Oh, my god!

175
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:07,720
Atlas!

176
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,780
Thank you!

177
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,140
Thank you for the...

178
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,380
I'm sorry.

179
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,980
I think... I...

180
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:15,960
I...

181
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,960
I don't know if I can help you with that.

182
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,360
I don't know if that will help, but thank you, Atlas!

183
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,080
For the $50!

184
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,640
Thank you so much!

185
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,260
Hello, Michael!

186
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,660
By the way, I saw what you meant when Peter said, thank you for hours.

187
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,900
I wanted to say that.

188
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,300
Yeah.

189
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,440
Okay.

190
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:36,530
Oh, my god.

191
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,130
I'm so fucking smart.

192
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:41,270
How do I...

193
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:46,750
Oh, my god!

194
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:47,650
I'm so smart!

195
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,650
Okay, to be fair, I just...

196
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,330
To be honest, I just...

197
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,650
Spammed... I just spammed shots until it worked.

198
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,550
I wasn't...

199
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:59,810
I don't know how I did it, but I did it.

200
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:04,670
Thank you again, Roy, for the fucking tier three.

201
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,610
So, it's crazy!

202
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,110
And also the $50!

203
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,870
Dude, I didn't even think about where to shoot it.

204
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:14,810
It just happened naturally.

205
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:19,150
You're doing so well.

206
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,650
What's this?

207
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,410
What is this?

208
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,470
Did it work?

209
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:33,750
Oh!

210
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,650
I thought this was it!

211
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,570
I thought this was the thing!

212
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,250
Oh, my god!

213
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,970
I'm so fucking stupid!

214
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:48,930
Please.

215
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,740
You broke so much!

216
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,740
This solid puzzle!

217
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,660
I did it!

218
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,600
Hey, Fez!

219
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,480
Okay.

220
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,360
Is this still level one?

221
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,040
I can't even tell.

222
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,090
I think right click and left click do a different portal.

223
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,370
Oh, I just been spamming left click.

224
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,330
Until it works.

225
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,870
I don't know what I'm doing.

226
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,730
I don't know what I'm doing.

227
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,850
I don't

228
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,020
know what I'm doing.

229
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,680
Oh, my god!

230
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,660
God, I'm so fucking smart.

231
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,160
Okay, where's the other one, though?

232
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,440
Is it this?

233
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,660
Oh, my god!

234
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,820
Holy shit!

235
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,220
Oh, my god!

236
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,200
I'm so sorry!

237
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,740
I'm so sorry!

238
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,080
This is really long level one.

239
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:04,760
This is really long level one.

240
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,520
So you're gonna get stuck here only on level one.

241
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,320
So you're gonna get stuck here only on level one.

242
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,420
Good job.

243
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,720
Oh, good job!

244
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,040
She said good job!

245
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,660
I'm big green.

246
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,980
I am big green.

247
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,220
Huh?

248
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,450
Where the fuck am I?

249
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,670
Where the fuck am I?

250
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:30,870
What?

251
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:38,900
What?

252
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:39,580
What happened?

253
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,300
I don't even know what happened!

254
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,840
What the fuck?!

255
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,880
What the fuck happened?

256
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,480
Hahaha!

257
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,480
If I do, you gonna require his brain power.

258
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,560
I see this keep going so long.

259
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:56,460
What is this?

260
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,480
Oh!

261
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,000
Oh!

262
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,060
Hahaha!

263
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,960
Okay, okay, okay, look...

264
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,820
Blood safety is one of many enrichment center goals.

265
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:18,820
The Aperture Science High Energy Pallet, seen to the left of the chamber, can and has caused prominent disabilities such as...

266
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,900
Okay, look...

267
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,400
Blood safety is one of many enrichment center goals.

268
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:33,560
The Aperture Science High Energy Pallet, seen to the left of the chamber, can and has caused prominent disabilities such as...

269
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,240
Oh my god, I did it.

270
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,940
First try, first try.

271
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,540
Also, thank you so much for the follow, Dargo!

272
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,060
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

273
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,720
Have a, have a butter, thank you so much!

274
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,300
Okay, wait, have a butter, yeah.

275
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,000
Look, look, look, first try, first try, first try.

276
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,100
Never died once, never died, never died.

277
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,260
Oh, Fluffy, thank you so much for the five bits!

278
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,500
Thank you, thank you, I really do appreciate it.

279
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,040
Thank you, guys.

280
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,060
Thank you.

281
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,520
Is that, is that five bits for my...

282
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,540
No deaths run?

283
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,820
Thank you, thank you, I know.

284
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:02,780
Haven't died yet.

285
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,520
I'm so fucking smart.

286
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:09,120
I'm pretty good, I'm pretty good at this game, yeah, see?

287
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,460
Desi thinks so.

288
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,300
I'm pretty fucking good.

289
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,220
Warning devices are required on all mobile equipment.

290
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:25,320
However, alarms and flashing hazard lights have been found to agitate the High Energy Pallet, and have therefore been disabled for your safety.

291
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,120
What, what is this?

292
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:27,760
Oh.

293
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:28,660
Oh shi-!

294
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,740
Interceptor signs on stationary scaffold.

295
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,720
What's going on?

296
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,120
Oh!

297
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,640
Okay.

298
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,680
She's, she's lost out there prog- what?

299
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,940
Oh, okay, it moves.

300
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,800
Damn, look at that, first try.

301
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,240
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

302
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,140
I'm getting this, I'm getting this.

303
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,620
My brain is slowly expanding.

304
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,420
It is getting bigger and bigger.

305
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:19,120
Oh shit, oh yeah guys, you saw, I saw what happened on Twitter for me, right?

306
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:24,980
Like, I was supposed to stream at 10, and then like, and then all the guru shit that happened.

307
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,700
Basically, okay, so...

308
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,480
Please note that we have added a consequence for failure.

309
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,040
Wait, let me get here.

310
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:29,860
I need to listen.

311
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:37,260
Any contact with the chamber floor will result in an unsatisfactory mark on your official testing record, followed by death.

312
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,260
Good luck.

313
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,860
Okay, so I was supposed to stream.

314
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:41,920
Um...

315
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,200
Are you sure you felt geometry?

316
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,780
Oh my god.

317
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,500
I was about to jump down.

318
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:52,960
Okay, so what happened was that basically the whole guru shit, apparently, apparently...

319
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,080
Is this what I'm supposed to do?

320
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,580
What am I supposed to do?

321
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,260
Is this, is this it?

322
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:12,280
Okay, so apparently, okay, so apparently guru accidentally, uh, she didn't know and she fucking...

323
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,140
Wait, what?

324
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:19,630
Where do I...

325
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,310
Where do I take this?

326
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,110
Where, where is it going?

327
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,170
Where is it going?

328
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,950
Where is this going?

329
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,090
Like this?

330
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:47,720
Where...

331
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,220
Where are you going?

332
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,440
Wait, did I do it?

333
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,680
Oh no, wait, wait, no.

334
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:54,940
Not yet.

335
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,560
Wait.

336
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,080
What is this?

337
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,120
Where are you?

338
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,260
Oh.

339
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,380
I...

340
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,020
I...

341
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:08,520
I...

342
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,560
Oh yeah, no, the emote got removed, basically.

343
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,400
But I had to like, deal with all that shit earlier today.

344
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,100
I...

345
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:23,900
What?

346
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,980
Wait, what?

347
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,500
Okay, so basically, guru asked, uh...

348
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:34,520
Uh, used emotes that were from an emote artist that were, that was tracing emotes.

349
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,020
So I had to like...

350
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:36,700
I had...

351
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,740
What the fuck?

352
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,180
I'm so fucking confused.

353
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,320
So...

354
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,000
So I had to like, uh...

355
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,820
I had, I made like a whole social media post about it.

356
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,660
And then she got it removed in an hour after that.

357
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,120
Which was pretty nice.

358
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,440
Cause usually like, you know, people don't react that fast and stuff.

359
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,500
So like my, um...

360
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,220
I like, like...

361
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,460
I like contacted my friend that got her emotes traced by that person.

362
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,640
So, guru was using those emotes for...

363
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,920
What the fuck am I doing?

364
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,020
Where, where is it?

365
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,860
Oh my god, can I...

366
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,920
Can I go here?

367
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:12,980
Where is this?

368
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:13,940
Okay.

369
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:14,400
Oh!

370
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,900
Look, I saw you go there!

371
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,300
Okay.

372
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,860
I'm so confused.

373
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,720
I'm so confused, chat!

374
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,100
Oh, oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.

375
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,320
No, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

376
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,500
Okay, okay.

377
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:41,980
Uh...

378
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,720
Wait, I got this.

379
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,800
I, I swear.

380
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,280
Okay, okay, okay.

381
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,740
Hey, Shijin!

382
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,960
I'm gonna bring her a smile.

383
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,840
Oh, fuck.

384
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,060
Okay, okay, wait.

385
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:57,640
Okay.

386
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,160
Like, no, no.

387
00:16:59,220 --> 00:16:59,360
Oh!

388
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,760
Oh, I know!

389
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,940
I, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know this.

390
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:04,500
I know this.

391
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:05,640
It's right here.

392
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,320
Oh my god, oh my god!

393
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,800
Oh my god, look, look, look at those!

394
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,060
Oh, I missed.

395
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:12,720
I missed!

396
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,340
I fucking missed!

397
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,380
I fucking missed!

398
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,460
I got it.

399
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,260
First try!

400
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,480
Oh, I forgot about the death ball.

401
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,560
At the end, it comes through the orange and it bounces.

402
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,660
Yeah, I didn't even get to read it, Lieutenant!

403
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,840
I didn't even get to read it!

404
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,380
I might have missed though.

405
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,040
I might have missed the, missed the first time.

406
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:41,580
Look.

407
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,640
Alright, first try, first try.

408
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,220
Never missed.

409
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,180
Never missed once.

410
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,820
Look at that.

411
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,940
That, my brain, my brain is so fucking big.

412
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,360
This is so sad.

413
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,400
This is so fucking sad.

414
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,960
Okay, but yeah, it was like a huge mess.

415
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,880
It was such a huge mess with the Gura thing.

416
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:18,000
And then now everyone's like trying to, everyone's trying to, trying to like get in on the, on the whole like, now that Gura has like new emote slots and stuff, every, all the emote artists are trying to get in on it and being like, I'm so sorry about,

417
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,200
about the whole, I saw like two emote artists doing sketches.

418
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,320
I don't know if he was one of them.

419
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,060
But then there was another one.

420
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:28,600
Uh, there was another emote artist doing sketches, hoping to get picked by Gura now.

421
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,660
Okay, before I, every time I take away a slice of the cake.

422
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,460
It's okay.

423
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,160
The cake's a lie anyway.

424
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,200
I don't need cake.

425
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,360
Oh.

426
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,660
Oh, I was like, this is easy.

427
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,240
I can just take it over there.

428
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:46,580
Okay.

429
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,080
Look at this.

430
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:48,900
Bam.

431
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,300
The Enrichment Center apologizes for this clear mess.

432
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,540
Oh, this is easy.

433
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:55,740
Boom.

434
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,140
Why the fuck is this easier?

435
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,860
Why was this easier than the last level?

436
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,120
What the fuck?

437
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,300
You remained resolute and resourceful in an atmosphere of extreme pessimism.

438
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,500
How the fuck was this easier?

439
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,140
That's not fair.

440
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:18,760
Okay.

441
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,100
Okay.

442
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:19,500
Okay.

443
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,680
But yeah, it was, uh, it was pretty chaotic.

444
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,120
I had to.

445
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,340
I'm surprised.

446
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,280
I'm, I'm surprised.

447
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:32,240
I'm surprised that no one like even like, uh, uh, mentioned about like girls traced emotes there.

448
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,780
Cause I, when I saw it, I was like, wait a minute.

449
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,360
Weren't those the traced emotes from that artist earlier?

450
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,980
And then, and then I was like, what the?

451
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,260
It's like, yeah, it's girls' art.

452
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:43,440
Yeah.

453
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,600
That's a big, a big opportunity.

454
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,060
Yeah.

455
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,520
Uh, going crazy too.

456
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,460
Going crazy about what?

457
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,100
Yeah.

458
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,460
This is very much about what the fuck did you say to me?

459
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:52,700
Yeah.

460
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,940
Um, but yeah.

461
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:55,780
Hello again.

462
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,260
I just got a call from a friend.

463
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,240
I couldn't believe that no one noticed it and I was the only one that like talked about it.

464
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,220
What are he, uh, where he notes in the Q and a, what is girl?

465
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:12,220
Grace the, the, the hollow live, uh, shark girl, uh, in the English, in the English community.

466
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,180
And like, what the fuck am I supposed to do here?

467
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,940
Oh, that's what it's supposed to do.

468
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,360
That's.

469
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,500
That's what I'm supposed to do.

470
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:28,760
Okay.

471
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,820
Where's the portal?

472
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,960
Where's the portal?

473
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,400
Oh!

474
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,100
Did I do it?

475
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,580
Is this the other side?

476
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,480
No, this is not the other side!

477
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,540
Oh yeah, yeah, and then Agura's emotes...

478
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:00,680
New emotes were traced from other Twitch emote artists.

479
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,060
And she didn't know.

480
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,380
So then I made a...

481
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,600
Phone died.

482
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,440
Yeah, so no one...

483
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,120
What the fuck?

484
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:21,920
Wait!

485
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,520
How?

486
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,040
How did I do this?

487
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,040
What?

488
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,180
Wait!

489
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,240
Wait!

490
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,220
How did I...

491
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,400
Okay, I passed the level.

492
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,200
I don't even need a no.

493
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,820
I don't even need a no!

494
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,340
I don't even need a no!

495
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,940
I just did it!

496
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,740
I don't know how the fuck I did this.

497
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,100
Here?

498
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,920
I just almost barked.

499
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,860
Hit empty.

500
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,840
Okay, this is momentum.

501
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,040
Okay, this is momentum.

502
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,060
Momentum.

503
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:05,380
The function of mass and velocity is conserved between portals.

504
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,580
In layman's terms, speedy things come out.

505
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,360
You launch yourself across the...

506
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,320
Wait, where's the door?

507
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:13,840
Wait.

508
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:17,940
Where is it?

509
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,220
Where is it?

510
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:19,520
Oh.

511
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,680
Oh my god, I did it!

512
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,680
I did it!

513
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,580
I think that's how portal works.

514
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,780
Each time you go through, you add mass to one and take it away from the other.

515
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,040
So you keep falling.

516
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,680
Eventually, you'll make a black hole.

517
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:37,460
Oh!

518
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:40,500
I...

519
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,900
I'm pretending to understand you, but...

520
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,140
I'm trying my best.

521
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,980
I'm trying my best, chat.

522
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,840
I'm trying...

523
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,140
Also, hi.

524
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:56,880
Hi, Gold.

525
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,520
I'm good.

526
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,020
I'm good.

527
00:22:59,120 --> 00:22:59,780
I'm just...

528
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,520
How hard do you want me to control backseating?

529
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,480
Um...

530
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,760
I think, like, even when I read the backseating comments...

531
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,740
...to always provide useful advice.

532
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,380
Like, is she giving me good advice?

533
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,700
Because I've not been listening.

534
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,680
I've not been listening at all, honestly.

535
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,740
But, like, I feel like even if people try to give me backseating gaming advice, I still don't understand.

536
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,280
I still wouldn't understand.

537
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,200
Because I remember Major was trying to...

538
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,060
I think it was Major was trying to explain to me something.

539
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:27,940
Or Lieutenant.

540
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,560
And I read it, and I was like, what the fuck are they trying to explain?

541
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,320
What are they talking about?

542
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,340
I don't think I'll understand even...

543
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,320
Oh, wait.

544
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:37,880
Okay.

545
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:38,860
We don't...

546
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,000
Oh.

547
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,020
Oh, water bad.

548
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,240
What?

549
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,600
Water bad.

550
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,380
But you...

551
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,320
The Enrichment Center promises to always provide a safe testing environment.

552
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:58,680
In dangerous testing environments, the Enrichment Center promises to always provide useful advice.

553
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,800
For instance, the floor here will kill you.

554
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,180
Try to avoid it.

555
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,140
What?

556
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:13,520
For your reference, it takes people an average two hours and three minutes to compete their game on their first try.

557
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:14,680
Oh.

558
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,520
But I'm not...

559
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,440
I ain't like other people.

560
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,960
I'm not average.

561
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,620
What is this?

562
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,660
Oh, it's this.

563
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,480
Oh, it's this.

564
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,600
Oh, it's this.

565
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,060
I'm just built different.

566
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,260
I'm just built...

567
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:35,840
Oh, no!

568
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,340
No!

569
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:48,650
Oh, my God.

570
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:48,970
Oh, my God.

571
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,330
I'm just built...

572
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,860
You are built different now.

573
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,100
Oh, my God.

574
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:00,500
That's it.

575
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,160
Thank you so much for the follow.

576
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:02,740
Thank you.

577
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,180
Thank you.

578
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:03,600
Thank you.

579
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:04,620
Have a...

580
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,340
Have a good one.

581
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,740
Thank you so much.

582
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,380
I'm just built different.

583
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,360
Where was I supposed to go?

584
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,340
Did I do it right?

585
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,220
Oh I did it!

586
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,240
Oh no!

587
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:36,900
I thought I was clear.

588
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,040
I thought I was clear after that.

589
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,980
Sorry, we haven't died yet.

590
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,120
I don't know what you're talking about.

591
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,060
Okay, alright.

592
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:50,840
We got it.

593
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,900
Where am I supposed to go?

594
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,280
Where?

595
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:05,900
What the?

596
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,620
Dookie touched the bat.

597
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,100
Why?

598
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:20,120
I'm gonna post one of these bat voice every time you get caught.

599
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,740
Oh my god!

600
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,080
Did I touch the gun?

601
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:25,700
Oh!

602
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,160
I was like, what do I do?

603
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:34,360
Also, I'm just... thank you so much for the 800 vids.

604
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,220
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

605
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,380
Oh my god.

606
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,000
Sorry!

607
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,320
Thank you for the five gifted subs!

608
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,700
Holy shit!

609
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,540
Thank you!

610
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,740
I have some clots, some clots.

611
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,000
Woo!

612
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,020
Woo!

613
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,220
Thank you, thank you.

614
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,860
Sorry, can we get some Fortnite real quick?

615
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,200
Can we get some Fortnite real quick?

616
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,020
Sorry, thank you so much.

617
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:58,640
Okay.

618
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,840
Alright, what do I do now?

619
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:00,720
What is this?

620
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:07,700
Excuse me?

621
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,700
How do I get there?

622
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:11,820
How do I?

623
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,020
Oh!

624
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,000
Wait, no, no, wait.

625
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,660
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

626
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,040
I already did the portal layer.

627
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,100
Okay, I don't need to click it.

628
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,020
I don't need to click it.

629
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,120
Okay, okay.

630
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:24,940
We got this.

631
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:25,420
We got this.

632
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,080
Dude, my brain is expanding.

633
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,940
My brain is expanding.

634
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,160
Look at that.

635
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:34,740
Look at that.

636
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,660
First try.

637
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,340
First fucking try.

638
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,540
No streamer can do first tries like me.

639
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,380
But, I'm glad you- I'm glad like my LapTater.

640
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,980
I really do appreciate it.

641
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,460
Thank you.

642
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,200
Oh my god.

643
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,860
This is not a two-hour game.

644
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,120
This is not- This cannot be a two-hour and thirty.

645
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,400
I refuse to play Fortnite.

646
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:58,740
I can't believe this is a 2 hour 30 minute game.

647
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,880
There's no way.

648
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,580
There's no fucking way.

649
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,640
Boom, first try.

650
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:11,820
Oh.

651
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,620
Okay, that's not it.

652
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,140
That has not it.

653
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,160
Wait, no!

654
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,000
I did it!

655
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,720
Look at that.

656
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:19,580
Boom!

657
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,200
I did it!

658
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,580
Wait.

659
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,660
Did I... did I fuck up?

660
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,380
Wait, wait, wait.

661
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,480
Where do I go?

662
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,620
Oh, okay!

663
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,260
Look at that.

664
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:34,640
Boom.

665
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,540
I did it.

666
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,080
Oh my god, tater!

667
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,840
Oh my god, sorry!

668
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:42,520
Okay, I said it wrong.

669
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,860
Sorry, thank you so much for the gift and stuff to tater!

670
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,540
Thank you, thank you!

671
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,620
Can we get some Fortnite drill?

672
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,080
Oh my gosh, how can I clap now?

673
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,700
Can we get some Fortnite drill quick?

674
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,180
To tazar for gifting us stuff to tater.

675
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,840
I really do appreciate it, guys.

676
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,040
I really do appreciate it.

677
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,680
I checked it at 2.7 hours.

678
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,020
Okay.

679
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:00,720
Alright.

680
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,420
So 2.7 hours is the speedrun, right?

681
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,840
It's the speedrun.

682
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,440
It's the speedrun.

683
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,980
And now... don't worry.

684
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:09,620
Okay, okay.

685
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:10,800
What the fuck?

686
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,080
Where does this... what does this open?

687
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,280
Oh...

688
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,860
How do I get this?

689
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:28,540
How...

690
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:41,150
Where is it?

691
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,570
Did I fuck up?

692
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:44,770
What?

693
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,730
I'm so confused!

694
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,890
What did she do?

695
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:50,670
It doesn't even...

696
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:51,670
This is what she did.

697
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:52,510
Oh...

698
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,680
Wait... but why?

699
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,420
Wait... where is it?

700
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,000
How do I...

701
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,460
Where the fuck is the queue?

702
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,760
Where is it?

703
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,620
She's just stupid!

704
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,100
Oh my god!

705
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,240
I'm so fucking smart!

706
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,940
I'm so fucking smart!

707
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,180
Look at that shit!

708
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,360
I didn't need your help anyway!

709
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,180
Look at that shit!

710
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,160
Boom!

711
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,380
Wheeeee!

712
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,240
I did it!

713
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,740
Let's try it.

714
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,380
Let's try it.

715
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,040
What do you mean I'm not stupid?

716
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,540
I'm not stupid!

717
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:01,600
I'm not stupid!

718
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,080
I swear!

719
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:02,880
I swear!

720
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,280
I'm just built different!

721
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,340
I'm just built different, chat!

722
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,520
I'm just built... exactly!

723
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,700
I'm just built different!

724
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,700
Some people are just built different!

725
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:25,260
Now that you are in control of both portals, this next test could take a very, very long time.

726
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:29,560
If you become lightheaded from thirst, feel free to pass out.

727
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:29,980
Okay.

728
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,480
See, she said it usually takes a long time, so it's fine.

729
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,000
You have a brain the size of Mars.

730
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,040
It was really a one brain cell!

731
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,580
It was really a one brain cell!

732
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,400
Yeah, it's... I'm just built different!

733
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:43,740
Look at that!

734
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,800
She said it'll take a long time, so that's okay.

735
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:48,640
She said it'll take a long time, so that's okay.

736
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,240
It's supposed to take a long time.

737
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,000
Should I do this?

738
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,460
Look at that.

739
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,980
I'll turn up as a tourist group!

740
00:31:59,340 --> 00:31:59,960
I'll turn up as a tourist group!

741
00:31:59,960 --> 00:31:59,980
Oh, no!

742
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:00,980
It's a place full of arid stems!

743
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,300
Oh, no!

744
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,740
Where the fuck is this?

745
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:08,920
Where's the cube?

746
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:09,800
Oh, there's a cube.

747
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,180
Wait, how do I get the cube?

748
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:21,590
Oh, wait, that is not the right way to aim.

749
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:23,870
Is it this?

750
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:25,210
Okay...

751
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:28,870
Where the fuck...

752
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:29,690
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

753
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:30,330
I got this.

754
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,190
Hmm?

755
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:35,270
Ah, shit, look at that!

756
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:36,650
Ringle burr.

757
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:37,870
Ringle burr.

758
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,130
Okay, okay, okay.

759
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:41,530
I thought you were gonna...

760
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:41,970
Yeah, exactly!

761
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:42,770
What do you mean?

762
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:43,390
I didn't miss!

763
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,610
I didn't miss!

764
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:46,150
I don't know what you're talking about.

765
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,490
You think I missed shots?

766
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:51,710
That was a headshot right there.

767
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:53,270
How do I get over there?

768
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:59,510
Oh my gosh, is this...

769
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,450
Wait, wait, wait.

770
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:02,210
I've got this.

771
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:03,250
I know what to do.

772
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:04,850
I know what to do.

773
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:08,830
Okay.

774
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:11,950
Maybe... maybe I don't know what to...

775
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:12,190
Wait.

776
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:15,250
I know what to do.

777
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:16,870
I know what to do.

778
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:18,190
Boom!

779
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:18,890
Look at that.

780
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:20,590
First try.

781
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:23,170
First try.

782
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:25,990
Why make it so...

783
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,170
What do you mean?

784
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,210
Where's my other...

785
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:31,030
Okay, okay.

786
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,150
This is our eighth segment.

787
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:35,110
Look at that.

788
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:35,430
See?

789
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,470
This is gonna get to the last one.

790
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:38,290
We're almost...

791
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:39,730
We're like, he's the new tech.

792
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:41,890
Okay.

793
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:43,730
Where do we go after that?

794
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:44,570
Where's the other one?

795
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:46,150
For

796
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:53,530
your own safety, do not destroy vital testing apparatus.

797
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:54,790
Wait.

798
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:56,470
Where's the other one?

799
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:57,970
I...

800
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:05,790
What?

801
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,110
Oh!

802
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:11,130
Oh!

803
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:12,370
Oh, wait.

804
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,190
Wait.

805
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:15,730
Where's the other...

806
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:18,250
Cube?

807
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,310
Where's...

808
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:26,840
Oh!

809
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,800
Okay, how do I get out of here though?

810
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,280
Okay.

811
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,160
Okay, okay, okay.

812
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,580
Left click.

813
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,720
Oh my...

814
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,540
Fucking...

815
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,120
Okay.

816
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,540
Sometimes you just build different.

817
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,700
There you go.

818
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,080
I'm just built different.

819
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,020
I'm just built different.

820
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,680
Look at that.

821
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:00,680
Wait, wait.

822
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,600
This is the entrance way.

823
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,150
I walked the wrong way.

824
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,620
I walked the wrong way.

825
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:07,920
I walked the wrong way.

826
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,460
I'm just built different.

827
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:09,840
I'm sorry.

828
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,280
I'm just built different.

829
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,620
Just went backwards.

830
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,180
I'm sorry.

831
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,660
There was an open door.

832
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,960
There was an open...

833
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,620
You go...

834
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,660
Everyone goes through open doors.

835
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,520
Sorry for my success.

836
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,380
Okay.

837
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,240
Okay, chat.

838
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,540
I swear, is this still level one?

839
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,620
Is this still fucking level one?

840
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,060
This cannot still be level one.

841
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:43,300
All subjects intending to handle high energy gamma leaking portal to...

842
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,500
...technology must be informed that they may be informed of...

843
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,740
...assetable regulatory compliance issues.

844
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:49,780
What's that?

845
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:53,860
No further compliance information is required or will be provided.

846
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:54,420
No further compliance information is required or will be provided.

847
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:57,160
And you are an excellent test subject.

848
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:57,320
And you are an excellent test subject.

849
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:57,400
See?

850
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,440
She said I'm excellent.

851
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:00,560
She said I'm excellent, chat.

852
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,400
Dougie's 90% brain.

853
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,440
If the elevator door is open, there's no...

854
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,160
...to go through the door.

855
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:08,900
Everyone goes...

856
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,200
Exactly!

857
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,480
Everyone goes through open doors.

858
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:11,680
What?

859
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,840
You go through the closed door?

860
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:15,300
Okay.

861
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,420
Where the fuck am I?

862
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,000
Huh?

863
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:32,800
Okay, okay.

864
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,600
That's not- That's clearly not it!

865
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,600
This is fluent in sarcasm, by the way.

866
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:41,280
Well, maybe to you, but to me, she- I'm like her favorite test subject.

867
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:42,900
I'm her favorite.

868
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,220
Okay, maybe just for fun, you should put a portal on the ceiling for it and move at it.

869
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:53,900
At max speed?

870
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,140
I can't even run!

871
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:55,740
What do you mean?

872
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,760
This is the fastest I go!

873
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:58,800
Oh, you mean bunny hop?

874
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,560
Do I bunny hop?

875
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,900
Do I bunny hop?

876
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,880
Oh, that didn't work.

877
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,360
I don't know if I'm doing it right.

878
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:06,880
Here?

879
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,600
Oh, that was not it!

880
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,040
That was not it.

881
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,660
That was not it.

882
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,320
That was not it.

883
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:26,780
Okay.

884
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,080
That was not it.

885
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:30,500
Okay.

886
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:32,800
This?

887
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,760
That's not max speed!

888
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,840
What do I do?

889
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,340
It'll work one day.

890
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,160
Okay, I give up.

891
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,360
Okay, this isn't clear enough.

892
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,460
It's clearly not this.

893
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:52,880
Oh, wait!

894
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:53,480
Is it?

895
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,760
Okay, the f***ing f***!

896
00:37:59,360 --> 00:37:59,720
Okay.

897
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,360
Wait, wait, wait.

898
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:00,900
Is it like this?

899
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,140
Is it like this?

900
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:09,310
Oh!

901
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:12,190
Oh!

902
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:13,970
Wait, wait, wait.

903
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:16,130
I know, I know, I know, I know.

904
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,150
My brain, my brain.

905
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,010
Brain expanding.

906
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:18,670
Brain expanding.

907
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,270
How did I f*** that up?

908
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:27,550
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

909
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:29,050
I...

910
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:29,730
I...

911
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:32,450
I don't know!

912
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:33,770
Oh, I can!

913
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:34,830
I know, I know, I know, I know!

914
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:35,990
I know, I know, I know, I know.

915
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,250
Okay, no, I don't.

916
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:40,770
I don't know.

917
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:46,270
I don't know.

918
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,550
You gotta line him up better?

919
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:50,730
You gotta line him up better?

920
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:50,730
How?

921
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,290
How do I...

922
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:53,770
How do I line this up better?

923
00:38:58,570 --> 00:38:59,410
Like this?

924
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,190
Like this?

925
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:00,430
Uh -oh.

926
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:04,770
I'll get it right...

927
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:05,070
Oh f***!

928
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:05,770
Okay.

929
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:11,890
Okay.

930
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:12,950
Okay, geometry is not my...

931
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,070
my strong geometry.

932
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:16,370
I'm not good at geometry.

933
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,450
I'm sorry.

934
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:21,990
Is this...

935
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:23,150
Is this it?

936
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:27,190
Is this it?

937
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:28,330
I got this.

938
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:28,870
I got...

939
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:33,690
Oh my god.

940
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:34,450
I almost got it.

941
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:35,130
I almost got it.

942
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:35,790
I almost got it.

943
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:36,330
He got it!

944
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:37,650
He got it.

945
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,790
I'm struggling.

946
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:40,470
I don't know what I'm...

947
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:46,970
Okay, now they're both up top.

948
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:48,570
Don't worry.

949
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:49,570
One day we'll get there.

950
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:50,090
One day.

951
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:51,830
Two... This is not a speedrun.

952
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:53,390
Just remember, two hours...

953
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:55,970
is the... is the speedrun time.

954
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,610
That's the speedrun.

955
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,050
Two hours is the speedrun.

956
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:00,590
We're doing the average gameplay.

957
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:03,590
The average run of the mill.

958
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,210
Oh!

959
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:05,650
Oh!

960
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,390
Oh I did it.

961
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:08,430
I thought I did it.

962
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,330
I thought I did it.

963
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:18,210
I was so happy.

964
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:19,790
I was so happy.

965
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,440
Please!

966
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,280
Please!

967
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:27,480
I'm...

968
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,160
Why is this so hard?

969
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,020
Why is this so hard?

970
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,740
Why is this so hard?

971
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,180
Oh my god!

972
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,540
Oh my god!

973
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:44,080
Oh my god!

974
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,100
This is...

975
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:47,660
This is...

976
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:53,120
Wait, you need to put the port at the bottom and one in the ceiling?

977
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,860
Is it for Cress?

978
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:56,820
Oh!

979
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:00,580
Oh!

980
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,080
Oh!

981
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,980
Oh my god!

982
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,020
Oh my god!

983
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,160
How did I still fuck that up?

984
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,900
How did I manage to fuck that up?

985
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,200
Oh my god!

986
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,180
Oh my god!

987
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,500
Oh my god!

988
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,740
How did I still fuck that up?

989
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:28,220
How?

990
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:32,740
Please.

991
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,080
Please.

992
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,200
That's a clean break.

993
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,180
Where does this even take me?

994
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,060
Oh!

995
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:42,880
It's this door.

996
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,740
Okay, I already forgot what door was what.

997
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,640
How long do you think we've been here?

998
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:49,900
Three hours!

999
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,660
No, actually five hours.

1000
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:52,280
Five hours.

1001
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,120
I'm being...

1002
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:54,940
Oh.

1003
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,020
Well then.

1004
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,160
Six hours.

1005
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,340
Six hours.

1006
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,100
Six hours.

1007
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:01,820
Six hours.

1008
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:05,660
It is always getting the portal on the floor.

1009
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,940
It's to aim under you as you fall.

1010
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,160
It is always getting the portal on the floor.

1011
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,680
Also, alright, just flip me off.

1012
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,840
It's for gold?

1013
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,300
Alright, here you go, gold.

1014
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,380
This is for you.

1015
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,020
I'm bee hopping.

1016
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:23,720
I'm bee hopping.

1017
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,020
I'm bee hopping.

1018
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:25,620
Okay.

1019
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,120
This goes up and down.

1020
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,440
This goes up and down.

1021
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,180
Hey, twins!

1022
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,400
Okay.

1023
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,180
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1024
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,120
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1025
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,700
Wait, wait, wait.

1026
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:50,700
This is not supposed to be there.

1027
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,080
Wait, wait, wait.

1028
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:52,620
This is not supposed to be there.

1029
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,240
Okay.

1030
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:01,830
Where is this supposed to go?

1031
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:04,390
It is supposed to go there.

1032
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:05,070
Okay, okay.

1033
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:06,650
Alright, alright.

1034
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,540
Oh, no no no.

1035
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:12,480
No no no no no.

1036
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,080
No no no no no no no no no NO!

1037
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:15,740
NO!

1038
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:16,700
Don't!

1039
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,220
Oh, he was going to heaven.

1040
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:21,980
He saw me.

1041
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:22,460
Okay, okay.

1042
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:23,940
I got this.

1043
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:24,700
Boom.

1044
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:25,980
And then BAM.

1045
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:28,340
And then...

1046
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:29,860
And then...

1047
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:30,660
Boom.

1048
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,120
Oh, wait wait wait.

1049
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:33,660
I fucked up.

1050
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,040
Oh wait.

1051
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,040
Wait wait wait.

1052
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,820
Wait wait I fucked up.

1053
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:37,240
Boom.

1054
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:37,980
Wait.

1055
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,260
Boom?

1056
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,340
Wait.

1057
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,560
Where does it go?

1058
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,420
What?

1059
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,180
Is this portal 2?

1060
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:08,400
Yeah.

1061
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,500
No, this is portal 1.

1062
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,140
BOOM!

1063
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:16,360
Wait!

1064
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:16,560
No!

1065
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,080
No!

1066
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:17,560
No!

1067
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,420
Please.

1068
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,540
Wrong boom.

1069
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:25,640
Wrong boom.

1070
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:31,120
I have to go all the way back?

1071
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,520
Wait wait wait.

1072
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,600
I need this for...

1073
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,660
For that.

1074
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:35,260
Okay.

1075
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:36,480
Okay.

1076
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:37,400
Boom.

1077
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:38,540
Okay okay okay.

1078
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,260
Please do not have a death counter for me.

1079
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,420
Because you guys don't even remember how many times I've died.

1080
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,200
So technically I've never died.

1081
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:47,340
Technically I've never died chat.

1082
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,940
Because you guys don't even remember.

1083
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,280
So no death counter for you.

1084
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:52,860
Okay.

1085
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:54,600
Okay.

1086
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,080
Boom.

1087
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:00,990
Boom.

1088
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:01,190
Boom.

1089
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:04,430
Michael uses portals to cross faster.

1090
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:07,670
Wait no.

1091
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:11,910
But how can I use portals if I'm using portals for the boom?

1092
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:13,470
How can I use portals if I'm using portals for the boom?

1093
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:13,810
That doesn't make sense.

1094
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:19,890
I already put the orange, so I just need the blue, right?

1095
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:22,070
No no.

1096
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:23,710
It's zero.

1097
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:24,230
It's zero.

1098
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:25,470
Zero times.

1099
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:26,030
Zero times.

1100
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:26,470
Watch this.

1101
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:29,730
That's right.

1102
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:31,190
God!

1103
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:34,090
So sweet.

1104
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:35,930
And he's on a cute track.

1105
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:41,610
Okay, wait, where do I go?

1106
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:50,210
Oh, you send your previous body to...

1107
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:52,070
Oh!

1108
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:56,860
Look at that.

1109
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,960
First try, zero deaths.

1110
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:05,510
Zero deaths, zero deaths.

1111
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:09,250
No one have a counter, so technically I've never died, right?

1112
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:13,410
No one have a counter, so technically I've never died, right?

1113
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:13,950
This is so pathetic.

1114
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:18,810
Fucking children get finished with games.

1115
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:19,190
Fucking children get finished with games.

1116
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:19,570
Fucking children get finished with games.

1117
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:25,990
I hate doing three-tailed during bird outs in your mind.

1118
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:26,710
You're not dying.

1119
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:28,910
Out of territory, she's moving into a new...

1120
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:30,450
Exactly, exactly, I'm not dying.

1121
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:32,530
I've technically never died.

1122
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:53,070
Did I do it?

1123
00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:54,310
Did I cross?

1124
00:46:58,450 --> 00:47:00,070
Dermatocarp, thank you so much for the follow.

1125
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:01,790
I really do appreciate it.

1126
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:03,290
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1127
00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:05,510
Where's my hands?

1128
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:06,230
Have a butt heart.

1129
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:07,070
Thank you so much.

1130
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:07,990
Thank you.

1131
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:09,210
Oh, where's my butt heart?

1132
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:10,010
Where's my hands?

1133
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:11,330
Oh, there it is.

1134
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:12,230
Have a butt heart.

1135
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:13,570
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1136
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:15,850
Wait, how long is this stream?

1137
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:17,430
It's been 30 minutes.

1138
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:20,010
We've only been streaming for 30 minutes.

1139
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:20,790
Isn't that crazy?

1140
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:23,490
And we're like 80% done of this...

1141
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:25,330
No, no, 30 minutes.

1142
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:35,290
I had to bed, night chat, and also thanks for the...

1143
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:36,030
Alright, good night.

1144
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:37,270
Good night, Deadpool.

1145
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:39,050
Thank you again for hanging out with us.

1146
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:40,250
I really do appreciate it.

1147
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:41,730
We have a good rest of the night.

1148
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:43,690
Where the fuck am I?

1149
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:46,010
30 minutes.

1150
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:47,990
30 minutes.

1151
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:01,590
Oh...

1152
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:02,810
Oh, I can go...

1153
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:03,010
What?

1154
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:06,810
Huh?

1155
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,100
Huh?

1156
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:18,630
Huh?

1157
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:20,850
I can...

1158
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:24,590
Shijin...

1159
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:27,790
Thank you so much for the tier one... for two months.

1160
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:29,810
Thank you, Shijin.

1161
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:30,490
Thank you.

1162
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:31,630
Oh, can we get some..?

1163
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:32,750
Oh my gosh, one hand and clap.

1164
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:35,350
Can we get some break nights real quick for Shijin?

1165
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:37,610
Are the tier ones still for two months?

1166
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:37,670
Alright.

1167
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:40,890
I got this.

1168
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:03,410
Wait, I need to look at this for a sec.

1169
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:07,490
No!

1170
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:12,510
Wait!

1171
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,940
I did it.

1172
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:21,860
I did it.

1173
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:21,960
I did it.

1174
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:24,960
Hi Marshall!

1175
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:31,000
I'm proving to everyone that I too can use... wait.

1176
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:32,660
Where's the exit?

1177
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:34,860
No, no, no.

1178
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:35,400
It's this one.

1179
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:36,220
This one.

1180
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:39,320
It's this one.

1181
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:44,080
So it shows that children under the age of 13 complete portal within hours on their first...

1182
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:47,540
within four hours of their first... of their first... of their first...

1183
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:48,100
That's good!

1184
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:48,760
That's good!

1185
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,240
Cause I'm only on my first 30 minutes.

1186
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:52,880
I've only been playing this game for 30 minutes.

1187
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:55,000
Don't mind the timer.

1188
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,180
Don't mind the timer.

1189
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:57,320
Twitch is bugged right now.

1190
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:59,500
I've only been playing Portal for 30 minutes chat.

1191
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,820
I've only been playing Portal for 30 minutes.

1192
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,020
So everyone's lying to you.

1193
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:10,080
It doesn't say 30 minutes.

1194
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:27,060
Wait, is this another area?

1195
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,840
Oh, this is another area!

1196
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,580
Where the fuck is this?

1197
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:32,280
Huh?

1198
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:35,120
Oh, do I make the falling thing?

1199
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:42,990
Oh my.

1200
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:44,150
Am I trapped?

1201
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:48,670
What is this?

1202
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:51,010
Six take it...

1203
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:55,690
Oh!

1204
00:50:58,190 --> 00:50:58,790
Boom!

1205
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,070
Oh, it didn't work.

1206
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:03,150
It didn't work.

1207
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:04,410
It didn't work.

1208
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:06,530
I should start playing machine practice.

1209
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:07,870
I forgot everything.

1210
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:10,110
I actually never...

1211
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:10,710
Okay.

1212
00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:14,570
Huh?

1213
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:17,510
Huh?

1214
00:51:17,910 --> 00:51:18,630
Huh?

1215
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:33,080
Oh, I'm here.

1216
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:35,060
Okay.

1217
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:35,740
Okay.

1218
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:39,680
Is this right?

1219
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,320
Wait, I had it lined up?

1220
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,040
What?

1221
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:45,780
Huh?

1222
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:50,780
Certain objects may be vital to your success.

1223
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:52,840
Do not destroy testing applications.

1224
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:53,940
No!

1225
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,020
I got this!

1226
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:55,860
Wait, what is this?

1227
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:56,960
Oh, I cannot use that.

1228
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,760
Maybe my jump?

1229
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:00,360
No.

1230
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:02,080
No.

1231
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:03,760
Wait.

1232
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:10,590
Huh?

1233
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:11,470
I say, you are the best.

1234
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:13,350
I say, you are the best.

1235
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:18,230
I wish I could be more active, but glad to see you are my footing.

1236
00:52:18,490 --> 00:52:19,090
Huh?

1237
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:20,310
Oh, Pia-san!

1238
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:24,530
Thank you for the tier one for 29 months!

1239
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:26,470
Can we get some Fortnite?

1240
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:28,010
You will play for Pia-san!

1241
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:29,270
Thank you!

1242
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:31,170
Thank you!

1243
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:34,490
Yes, I got my footing.

1244
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:36,390
I got this!

1245
00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:38,650
This is the first try.

1246
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:40,570
I've only been playing this game for 30 minutes.

1247
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:40,890
30 minutes!

1248
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:45,550
It's only been 30 minutes and I'm already 90% done with this game.

1249
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:14,320
Wait, no... no...

1250
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:18,500
Do I jump like this?

1251
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:19,140
Wait!

1252
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:19,700
Oh...

1253
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:26,140
Wait, wait, wait, wait...

1254
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:27,580
Wait, wait, wait... 30 minutes!

1255
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:30,160
30... I've only been playing this game for 30 minutes, chat!

1256
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,000
It's only been 30 minutes!

1257
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:34,840
Wait, wait, I got this, I got this.

1258
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,480
Do I... I know, I know, I can b-hop.

1259
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:37,360
I b-hop here, right?

1260
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,060
Okay, no, that's not it.

1261
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:45,360
Maybe... maybe if I keep doing it...

1262
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,120
Maybe if I keep doing it...

1263
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:50,420
Boom!

1264
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:54,660
Check everywhere?

1265
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,380
Wait, can I go backwards?

1266
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:01,720
Wait!

1267
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:02,760
Wait!

1268
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:04,260
Oh no, I'm trapped.

1269
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:08,960
I'm b-hopping!

1270
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,620
Yes, yes, this is b-hop!

1271
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:14,880
I'm fucking doing... I play FPS games.

1272
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:16,820
I know how to b-hop!

1273
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:29,840
Where else can I...

1274
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:31,200
Where...

1275
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:33,600
Where else?

1276
00:54:42,610 --> 00:54:44,030
Wait, wait a minute!

1277
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:45,830
Wait a minute!

1278
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:47,350
I got this!

1279
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:51,390
Okay, no, I don't... no, I thought... I thought... I thought I got it.

1280
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:54,030
I thought I... I thought I... I got it.

1281
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:54,370
Wait!

1282
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:55,890
Oh, is it here?

1283
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:01,130
Wait, wait, there's instructions!

1284
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:03,730
There's inst... Oh, there's inst... Wait!

1285
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:05,190
I got it!

1286
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:06,270
I got it!

1287
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:07,370
I got it!

1288
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:08,050
Wait!

1289
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:09,350
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

1290
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:12,310
Okay, no, wait...

1291
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:13,430
Wait...

1292
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:14,650
Wait, what?

1293
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:16,570
Go...

1294
00:55:29,570 --> 00:55:30,590
How do I put it here?

1295
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:32,090
How do I...

1296
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:32,950
How?

1297
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:37,700
Please!

1298
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:41,480
You wanna play support on the...

1299
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:42,820
Okay, okay, okay.

1300
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:43,960
Boom!

1301
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:50,380
Oh,

1302
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:54,780
my brain!

1303
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:55,700
My brain is expanding!

1304
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:56,500
My brain is expanding!

1305
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:56,800
Watch!

1306
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:57,800
Boom!

1307
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:58,980
Oh, my god!

1308
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:00,460
What did I miss?

1309
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:05,380
I actually missed!

1310
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:12,920
I didn't notice!

1311
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,540
I'm not even on that top 500 now!

1312
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,740
Look, I got top 500 not for my brain, okay?

1313
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:21,340
It was not for my brain.

1314
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:25,020
It was not for my brain, okay?

1315
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:26,580
Wait, wait!

1316
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:28,400
Okay, okay.

1317
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:30,580
Has returned as to your house.

1318
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:31,360
Hello, torture!

1319
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:33,640
Okay, okay, wait.

1320
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:34,660
I need to line this up.

1321
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:37,180
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1322
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,860
I got it, I got it.

1323
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,020
I got this, I got this.

1324
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:41,600
Boom!

1325
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,100
And it...

1326
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:45,980
Okay, okay, I got this.

1327
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:46,780
I got this.

1328
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:49,120
I...

1329
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:49,280
I...

1330
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:50,200
I...

1331
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:50,780
I...

1332
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:52,340
I...

1333
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,440
How did I not jump?

1334
00:56:58,540 --> 00:56:59,480
How you do this?

1335
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,140
How you do this?

1336
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:00,560
It's easy.

1337
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:02,800
Even though this is in 30 minutes.

1338
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,300
We won't even play for...

1339
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:04,840
How...

1340
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,060
How do I miss the jump?

1341
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,880
How do I miss the jump 20 times?

1342
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,720
Thank you so much for the follow.

1343
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,480
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1344
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:14,700
Have a...

1345
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:15,640
Have a blood heart.

1346
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:16,320
Oh, shit.

1347
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:17,140
Where's my heart?

1348
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:17,820
Have a blood heart.

1349
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:19,480
Thank you so much for the follow.

1350
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,240
Okay, okay.

1351
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:22,480
Just let yourself fall through it.

1352
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:22,700
Okay.

1353
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:23,200
Okay.

1354
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:23,220
Okay.

1355
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:24,360
Okay.

1356
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:26,700
Have a breath.

1357
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:27,900
I still fucked that up.

1358
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:28,900
How?

1359
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,420
Call 11, you're watching Outwanderer's supposed to be a class.

1360
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:34,220
Okay.

1361
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:36,660
Alright.

1362
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:42,200
Ow!

1363
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:51,060
Okay.

1364
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:56,980
Fall through.

1365
00:57:58,180 --> 00:57:59,080
Oh, my God!

1366
00:57:59,200 --> 00:57:59,820
Oh, my God!

1367
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:00,080
Oh, my God!

1368
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:00,460
Oh!

1369
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:00,520
Okay.

1370
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:00,600
Now, I'm going to jump.

1371
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:03,140
Alright, first try.

1372
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:04,980
First try.

1373
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:06,380
I got it, I got it.

1374
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:07,480
First try!

1375
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:10,060
It's never fucked up before.

1376
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:11,640
Did it need your help?

1377
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:11,940
Okay.

1378
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:13,220
Alright.

1379
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,620
Alright, it goes there.

1380
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:18,680
First try.

1381
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:20,740
Okay.

1382
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:23,060
Okay.

1383
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:24,820
Boom, boom.

1384
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:25,200
Boom.

1385
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:27,340
Boom.

1386
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:29,320
Boom.

1387
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:34,620
How do I... I... Boom?

1388
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:37,580
Oh!

1389
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,000
Boom!

1390
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:46,230
I got this.

1391
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:48,470
I just...

1392
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:49,370
Okay,

1393
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:57,660
I just need to fall through like this.

1394
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:58,800
And then...

1395
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,820
And I just gotta keep falling through, right?

1396
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:01,920
Right?

1397
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:03,680
Oh my god!

1398
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:05,520
I was right!

1399
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:07,520
I was right!

1400
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:09,440
Holy shit!

1401
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:15,620
Wait, shit, I'm doing this rainbow so far that she can only see through the boom.

1402
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:16,980
Like, I did it!

1403
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:18,460
I did it!

1404
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:18,800
I'm learning!

1405
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:20,080
I'm learning.

1406
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:22,580
My algorithm's getting better, chat.

1407
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,300
Are you still... Yeah, we're still doing horror games.

1408
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:27,280
We're so close.

1409
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,020
We're like... We're like 20-something, I think.

1410
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,620
I think I can't...

1411
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:31,820
I'm doing math.

1412
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:32,120
I'm doing math, dude.

1413
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:34,340
I'm... I'm... I'm freaking out math right now.

1414
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:36,900
I can barely fucking boom correctly.

1415
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:42,680
For one time I spent 50 minutes on a puzzle and two odd dudes saw I was moving the box lately.

1416
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:44,480
She did it.

1417
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:45,720
It's 200 cells.

1418
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:48,720
200 cells, and then we'll have a scary game.

1419
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:49,380
It's not scary.

1420
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:50,120
Are you talking?

1421
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:52,940
Okay.

1422
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:53,420
Okay.

1423
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:55,940
It goes boom, boom, boom.

1424
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:58,740
So, boom, boom.

1425
00:59:58,740 --> 00:59:59,200
Boom.

1426
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,820
And then...

1427
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:03,880
Boom.

1428
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:04,860
Boom.

1429
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,600
Boom.

1430
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:09,040
Oh, wait.

1431
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,880
Wait a minute.

1432
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:14,760
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

1433
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:17,520
Oh, wait.

1434
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:20,000
Boom.

1435
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:22,220
Boom?

1436
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:23,740
Boom.

1437
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:28,410
Where is this?

1438
01:00:28,410 --> 01:00:31,610
Wait, how do I get it straight?

1439
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:42,940
I'm gonna say those boots are gonna need a boom.

1440
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:48,780
I'll let you have my brain cell.

1441
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:51,120
Thank you, Lieutenant.

1442
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,800
I need every brain cell I can get right now.

1443
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:55,340
Wait, where does this go?

1444
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:56,320
It goes...

1445
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:59,260
Alright, I'm trying to angle this.

1446
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,140
Okay, it's here.

1447
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:03,380
This is...

1448
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:03,980
This is...

1449
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:04,460
This is the thing.

1450
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:05,440
This is the thing.

1451
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:05,980
Right here.

1452
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:08,100
Right here.

1453
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:09,440
Boom.

1454
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:11,700
Boom, boom, boom.

1455
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:12,740
Okay, okay.

1456
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:14,280
Okay.

1457
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:15,820
Can I put portal here?

1458
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:16,500
No, I cannot.

1459
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,480
Where the fuck do I...

1460
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:20,980
Where...

1461
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:22,760
How does it go here?

1462
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:25,540
What the fuck?

1463
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:32,120
My brain!

1464
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:35,040
My brain expanding!

1465
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:38,000
Wait, where did it go?

1466
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,020
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1467
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:41,540
It goes...

1468
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:42,980
Boom, boom.

1469
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:44,160
Right?

1470
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,500
No, no, it's angled.

1471
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:47,100
It's angled.

1472
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:48,560
It's angled.

1473
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:50,800
The screen is like...

1474
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:52,980
I'm so confused.

1475
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:57,350
Wait.

1476
01:01:57,790 --> 01:01:58,390
What?

1477
01:01:58,890 --> 01:02:00,430
How does this... Is this geometry?

1478
01:02:01,410 --> 01:02:03,790
Do I need to know geometry for this chat?

1479
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:04,450
Do I...

1480
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:07,540
What?

1481
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:08,940
How did it go from here?

1482
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:09,900
What?

1483
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:11,360
I'm so confused.

1484
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,120
Wait, I think I almost got it!

1485
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:18,960
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.

1486
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:21,460
Wait, how am I... how is this working?

1487
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:26,000
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1488
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:29,140
Okay, wait.

1489
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:35,580
Here, and then curve, and then goes back to me, and then...

1490
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:38,900
No, that's not it, that's not it.

1491
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:41,080
That's not it, I haven't seen...

1492
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:43,440
Here?

1493
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:45,120
No, wait, no.

1494
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:46,720
Wait, why is this here?

1495
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:47,700
Wait.

1496
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,320
Wait, wait, wait, wait, oh.

1497
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:54,680
Okay, geometry, I just need to learn geometry.

1498
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:57,600
I just need to learn geometry chat.

1499
01:02:58,960 --> 01:02:59,920
I... Geometry?

1500
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:03,260
Yeah?

1501
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:06,040
Wait!

1502
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:07,780
Oh no, that's not...

1503
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:09,260
Wait!

1504
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:16,900
Oh, I do, I do.

1505
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:21,240
It's like waiting for the pause to hit the corner.

1506
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:26,700
On the TV screen from this game, it makes your brain the opposite of smooth.

1507
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:29,320
And a little... okay.

1508
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:32,180
Physics, okay, I just need to learn geometry and physics chat.

1509
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:34,800
I got this, it's not like I almost fell geometry.

1510
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:36,220
I just...

1511
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:37,420
Wait, wait, is this it?

1512
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:38,240
No.

1513
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:39,500
Wait, no.

1514
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:40,480
Okay.

1515
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:41,840
Here?

1516
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:43,220
Is this...

1517
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:44,940
Is it angled correctly?

1518
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:50,660
I'm just gonna wait until it's angled and equals angle... angles out.

1519
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:53,100
Okay, okay, Pythagoras theorem.

1520
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:55,640
I just need the Pythagorean theorem, right?

1521
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:57,440
Okay, is this angled now?

1522
01:03:58,180 --> 01:03:59,380
Oh, no, it's not.

1523
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:00,660
Here?

1524
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:02,040
Here?

1525
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:04,580
Here?

1526
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:07,630
Here?

1527
01:04:07,770 --> 01:04:07,830
Here?

1528
01:04:08,330 --> 01:04:08,870
Here?

1529
01:04:08,870 --> 01:04:08,890
Here?

1530
01:04:08,990 --> 01:04:09,530
Here?

1531
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:13,790
Oh, I'm learning geometry.

1532
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:17,070
Oh, my god, did I do it?

1533
01:04:17,650 --> 01:04:18,810
Wait, where did it go?

1534
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:24,160
Is it here?

1535
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:26,240
Am I learning it?

1536
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:29,220
Where does my thing go?

1537
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:32,860
Here?

1538
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:36,600
Oh!

1539
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:38,620
Oh, what?

1540
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:39,420
I'm learning...

1541
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:40,420
I'm just going there.

1542
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:46,180
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, where is it?

1543
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:48,300
Oh, wait, no, that's not it.

1544
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:48,900
That's not it.

1545
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:49,740
That was not...

1546
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:50,720
Is it here?

1547
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:54,020
I'm just doing it until it works, chat.

1548
01:04:54,820 --> 01:04:55,640
I'll get there.

1549
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:57,460
I'll get there.

1550
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,860
I'll get there very slowly.

1551
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:06,960
Okay, that's not it.

1552
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:08,720
Huh?

1553
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:12,760
I really love her lizard.

1554
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:13,820
She's still on freeze.

1555
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:17,120
Okay, that... wait, is it this?

1556
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:19,180
No, it's going down.

1557
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:20,500
It's going...

1558
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,120
I don't know.

1559
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:23,560
Please!

1560
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:26,860
How do I do this?

1561
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:30,560
Is it here?

1562
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:38,480
I'm gonna watch the whole frame.

1563
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:41,900
I'm so confused, chat.

1564
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:44,660
Is this it?

1565
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:50,080
Wait, the ball is supposed to go...

1566
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:03,700
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1567
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:04,960
Oh, I forgot.

1568
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:09,280
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1569
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:15,180
Oh, wait!

1570
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:15,640
This

1571
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:24,050
is it?

1572
01:06:25,330 --> 01:06:25,950
Wait.

1573
01:06:27,430 --> 01:06:28,050
No?

1574
01:06:30,110 --> 01:06:30,730
No.

1575
01:06:31,390 --> 01:06:31,550
No?

1576
01:06:32,090 --> 01:06:34,830
Also, thank you so much for the follow, check.

1577
01:06:35,490 --> 01:06:36,510
Thank you.

1578
01:06:37,890 --> 01:06:39,770
Thank you for the follow.

1579
01:06:40,990 --> 01:06:42,310
Here's the butt heart.

1580
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:44,550
Thank you so much.

1581
01:06:46,110 --> 01:06:46,790
Okay.

1582
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:50,890
Here?

1583
01:06:52,210 --> 01:06:52,810
I

1584
01:07:03,010 --> 01:07:03,730
did it!

1585
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:05,150
Oh, I'm so sorry!

1586
01:07:07,710 --> 01:07:09,810
Oh, I'm so sorry!

1587
01:07:14,890 --> 01:07:15,790
Oh, my God!

1588
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:17,050
I'm so fucking sorry!

1589
01:07:18,230 --> 01:07:18,670
God!

1590
01:07:18,670 --> 01:07:20,410
I didn't need any of your help.

1591
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:21,130
Look at that shit!

1592
01:07:21,450 --> 01:07:22,430
How do I get out of here?

1593
01:07:24,070 --> 01:07:26,090
Wait, how do I get out?

1594
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:29,190
How do I...

1595
01:07:29,190 --> 01:07:30,850
How do I get out?

1596
01:07:34,330 --> 01:07:34,770
Wait.

1597
01:07:35,450 --> 01:07:36,730
How do I get out of here?

1598
01:07:38,950 --> 01:07:41,610
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1599
01:07:42,510 --> 01:07:45,790
Wait, wait, I got this, I got this.

1600
01:07:46,370 --> 01:07:47,650
I land here, right?

1601
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:50,270
And then, oh, the portal doesn't work there.

1602
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:53,050
Oh!

1603
01:07:53,550 --> 01:07:53,970
Oh!

1604
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:58,820
I know, I know, I know.

1605
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:00,320
Boom!

1606
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:00,840
Oh.

1607
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:01,820
Wait.

1608
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:06,180
And then...

1609
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:07,600
And then...

1610
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:09,320
And then...

1611
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:10,100
And then...

1612
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:11,100
And then...

1613
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:12,220
And then...

1614
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:13,580
And...

1615
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:14,420
And then...

1616
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:15,520
I can't...

1617
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:17,440
I'll get there.

1618
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:18,300
I'll...

1619
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:20,980
You're overthinking this.

1620
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:26,120
Okay, I'm overthinking this.

1621
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:26,720
It's simple.

1622
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,080
It's simple geometry.

1623
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:30,940
It's simple geometry chat.

1624
01:08:35,230 --> 01:08:37,130
She didn't get there.

1625
01:08:40,030 --> 01:08:40,830
Okay.

1626
01:08:42,330 --> 01:08:42,670
Oh!

1627
01:08:42,970 --> 01:08:43,110
Oh!

1628
01:08:43,690 --> 01:08:44,510
Simple geometry.

1629
01:08:45,190 --> 01:08:46,150
I passed math.

1630
01:08:46,470 --> 01:08:48,030
I got an A plus in geometry.

1631
01:08:50,350 --> 01:08:51,050
Look at that.

1632
01:08:51,630 --> 01:08:52,070
Okay.

1633
01:08:52,190 --> 01:08:52,950
And then...

1634
01:08:53,550 --> 01:08:53,990
Yeah.

1635
01:08:54,270 --> 01:08:55,050
We did it.

1636
01:08:55,110 --> 01:08:55,510
We did it.

1637
01:08:55,890 --> 01:08:56,810
I did it.

1638
01:08:57,110 --> 01:08:58,370
I did it, chat.

1639
01:08:58,790 --> 01:08:59,750
I did it.

1640
01:09:01,730 --> 01:09:03,190
Wait, oh, I thought I was on this.

1641
01:09:03,770 --> 01:09:04,890
No, you're dead.

1642
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:08,980
Look at that.

1643
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:09,980
30 minutes.

1644
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:10,700
This is only...

1645
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:12,000
Wait, what?

1646
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:12,940
Oh!

1647
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:14,300
It's okay.

1648
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,000
Don't do this.

1649
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:17,300
Fuck!

1650
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:21,100
I thought it...

1651
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:25,480
I thought it wasn't moving.

1652
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,540
So dumb.

1653
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,420
Pound it on!

1654
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:35,600
Oh!

1655
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:36,880
Oh!

1656
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:38,880
Oh!

1657
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:38,960
Oh!

1658
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:39,220
Oh!

1659
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:40,100
Oh!

1660
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:40,700
Oh!

1661
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:41,900
Oh!

1662
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:41,920
Oh!

1663
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,440
Thank you so much for the one-bit hyper.

1664
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:44,320
Thank you.

1665
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:44,780
Thank you.

1666
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,200
I really do appreciate it.

1667
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:47,180
Thank you so much.

1668
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:48,200
Okay.

1669
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:48,520
Okay.

1670
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:49,000
I got this.

1671
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:49,860
I got this.

1672
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:51,740
I...

1673
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:55,500
Okay.

1674
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:56,580
Okay.

1675
01:09:56,620 --> 01:09:57,100
Did you do...

1676
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:57,500
Okay.

1677
01:09:57,620 --> 01:09:57,940
Look.

1678
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:58,680
Look, chat.

1679
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:03,280
Right?

1680
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:05,640
Oh!

1681
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:06,540
Right.

1682
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:07,760
And then...

1683
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:08,740
Right?

1684
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:10,660
Oh!

1685
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:11,200
Oh!

1686
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:11,900
Oh!

1687
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:12,900
Oh!

1688
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:13,540
I just need to wait for this.

1689
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:17,460
Okay.

1690
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:17,680
Okay.

1691
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:17,920
Okay.

1692
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:18,140
Okay.

1693
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:18,520
I got...

1694
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:19,080
Oh!

1695
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:19,620
Oh!

1696
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:20,240
Oh!

1697
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:20,300
Oh!

1698
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:22,680
I actually scared myself there.

1699
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:26,360
Look, that's me.

1700
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:27,960
That's me!

1701
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:30,060
Okay, now I just gotta wait for this.

1702
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:34,120
Look at that.

1703
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:34,780
God.

1704
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:36,880
Look at that.

1705
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,380
Only 35 minutes have passed since I started this game.

1706
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:43,360
This is like a speedrun game.

1707
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:43,740
I'm gonna run like a huge speedrun right here.

1708
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:46,360
This is a speedrun record.

1709
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:47,060
Right here.

1710
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:47,520
Right now.

1711
01:10:48,340 --> 01:10:48,920
Right here.

1712
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:49,300
Wait.

1713
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:49,840
Where is my portal?

1714
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:50,840
Wait.

1715
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:51,620
What did I use?

1716
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:52,140
Wait.

1717
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:52,500
What color?

1718
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:52,920
Guys!

1719
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:53,820
What color was the portal?

1720
01:10:54,220 --> 01:10:55,260
What color was it?

1721
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:56,560
I don't remember.

1722
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:57,600
I...

1723
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:58,880
I don't wanna wait.

1724
01:10:58,960 --> 01:10:59,580
I need to chat.

1725
01:11:00,180 --> 01:11:01,460
What color was it, guys?

1726
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:02,300
Please.

1727
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,060
I'm streaming this game for you.

1728
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:06,080
It's not orange.

1729
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:06,660
It's not orange.

1730
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:08,060
Oh my gosh!

1731
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:09,260
It was orange!

1732
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:11,800
It was orange.

1733
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:13,180
Oh, I can't believe that.

1734
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:13,340
Oh!

1735
01:11:13,340 --> 01:11:13,420
What?

1736
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:14,900
I could have done that.

1737
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:20,840
Okay.

1738
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:23,580
Okay.

1739
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:24,140
Alright.

1740
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:25,740
What do I have to do?

1741
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:28,160
Never trust us!

1742
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:32,500
Do I go up?

1743
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:35,080
Up?

1744
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:37,840
Up.

1745
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:40,280
What does this do?

1746
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:43,820
What is that?

1747
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:44,880
Oh!

1748
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:47,620
Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1749
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:49,400
Okay, okay.

1750
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:50,460
I do...

1751
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:52,240
uppies.

1752
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,080
Wait.

1753
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:55,380
Uppie?

1754
01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:05,760
Where's the ray?

1755
01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:08,040
Go down?

1756
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:09,540
Yeah.

1757
01:12:10,180 --> 01:12:10,660
Oh!

1758
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:12,780
What?

1759
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:15,620
Where is it?

1760
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:18,360
Does this open this?

1761
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:20,540
What do you open?

1762
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:20,800
Open!

1763
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:23,420
What do you open?

1764
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:26,580
Oh, you have to go to the other side!

1765
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:32,680
You have to go to the fucking other side.

1766
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:35,420
Oh my god.

1767
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:40,220
We gotta time this.

1768
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:41,960
I need to keep pressing this so I...

1769
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,040
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1770
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:47,860
Okay.

1771
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:48,020
Okay.

1772
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:49,600
Please, please, please, please!

1773
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:50,860
No!

1774
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:51,300
Oh!

1775
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:51,780
No!

1776
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,460
Are you g- Oh my god.

1777
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:58,860
Okay, I gotta time this.

1778
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:00,060
I need to time this perfectly.

1779
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:02,580
I need to time this perfectly.

1780
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:05,480
I need to time this perfectly.

1781
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:09,240
Wait, where is it?

1782
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:09,780
No!

1783
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:11,440
Please!

1784
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:12,920
Oh.

1785
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:13,740
I got it.

1786
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:19,060
I'm so lucky.

1787
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:22,240
I did it.

1788
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:23,900
I did a chat.

1789
01:13:24,860 --> 01:13:27,520
Only one minute has passed since I did this level.

1790
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:29,480
Only one minute.

1791
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:30,740
Don't listen to Nightbot.

1792
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:32,380
Like, Nightbot's lying to you.

1793
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:34,740
I'm improving my algor- algorithm.

1794
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:37,760
I'm expanding my algorithm right now.

1795
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:43,840
This is so sad.

1796
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:50,430
There's a reason why we don't do variety.

1797
01:13:51,090 --> 01:13:55,770
The appropriate chamber for this testing sequence is currently unavailable.

1798
01:13:56,010 --> 01:13:57,670
It has been replaced with a nice fire core designed for military and droids.

1799
01:13:57,670 --> 01:13:59,170
All I think about is the big shot-quote.

1800
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:00,010
What more can I say?

1801
01:14:00,210 --> 01:14:03,930
I know trigonometry, geometry in every tribe of three.

1802
01:14:04,170 --> 01:14:06,710
...for the inconvenience and wishes you the best of luck.

1803
01:14:07,550 --> 01:14:08,030
Okay.

1804
01:14:08,570 --> 01:14:10,130
Oh, it's the laser guys!

1805
01:14:11,330 --> 01:14:12,270
Can I move them?

1806
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:13,730
Oh, I can move them!

1807
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:32,260
Oh my god!

1808
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:36,300
What do I do now?

1809
01:14:38,220 --> 01:14:39,980
Is this supposed to be like that?

1810
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:42,360
Did I fuck it up?

1811
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:44,520
Oh it's dead!

1812
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:45,620
Oh it's dead!

1813
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:47,000
Okay, okay it's dead.

1814
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:47,860
It's dead.

1815
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:52,780
Oh my god.

1816
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:25,080
Yeah it is, it's 1221 AM right now.

1817
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:26,620
It's technically Wednesday right now.

1818
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:32,400
What!

1819
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:32,880
What!

1820
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:33,540
Stop!

1821
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:34,260
Stop.

1822
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:35,400
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

1823
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:38,020
Stop.

1824
01:15:38,460 --> 01:15:39,120
Stop.

1825
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:39,860
Stop.

1826
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:40,300
Stop.

1827
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:43,560
Stop, I'm safe.

1828
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:47,300
I'm safe, I'm safe, I'm safe.

1829
01:15:55,150 --> 01:15:56,540
Oh I'm safe.

1830
01:16:03,450 --> 01:16:04,830
There you are.

1831
01:16:05,190 --> 01:16:06,750
Are you still there?

1832
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:10,140
Yes.

1833
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:12,900
Please shoot yourself.

1834
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:13,720
Can it shoot itself?

1835
01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:14,780
Can it shoot itself?

1836
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:17,240
Can this shoot itself?

1837
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:18,340
Too bad, Kate.

1838
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:20,000
Please.

1839
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,620
I'm gonna trade on this geometry!

1840
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,840
Oh no, now there's double the laser.

1841
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:28,940
Now there's double the laser!

1842
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:32,200
Wait, can it not shoot itself?

1843
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:32,340
Can it not shoot itself?

1844
01:16:39,590 --> 01:16:41,290
Just dodge the bullets.

1845
01:16:46,430 --> 01:16:47,130
Wait.

1846
01:16:51,270 --> 01:16:52,370
What do I do?

1847
01:16:56,510 --> 01:16:59,090
I can just go behind him.

1848
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:01,310
I can just go behind him!

1849
01:17:04,630 --> 01:17:05,950
I was trading on the geometry.

1850
01:17:05,970 --> 01:17:07,210
I can make it shoot itself!

1851
01:17:07,470 --> 01:17:08,670
I just went behind!

1852
01:17:10,730 --> 01:17:11,910
Oh my god.

1853
01:17:12,610 --> 01:17:13,170
Please!

1854
01:17:13,310 --> 01:17:13,730
Please!

1855
01:17:15,090 --> 01:17:15,650
Jungle!

1856
01:17:21,410 --> 01:17:21,970
Okay.

1857
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:34,720
Hello.

1858
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:36,600
Can I go behind here?

1859
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:40,920
Oh shit.

1860
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:41,980
Am I breaking...

1861
01:17:41,980 --> 01:17:42,960
Am I breaking the level?

1862
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:47,640
Why did the music change?

1863
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:50,420
What?

1864
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:51,660
What?

1865
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:00,820
Am I supposed to be here?

1866
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:01,980
Am I supposed to be here?

1867
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:03,960
Did I parkour?

1868
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:04,440
Did I parkour?

1869
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:08,180
Hey, Rally!

1870
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:11,220
Oh wait, is this an easter egg?

1871
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:11,820
Oh wait, is this an easter egg?

1872
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:15,020
I have no... What the fuck is this?

1873
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:15,600
I have no...

1874
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:15,600
What the fuck is this?

1875
01:18:16,420 --> 01:18:17,220
There's milk.

1876
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:22,460
Can I use this to reflect people?

1877
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:23,720
Can I use this to reflect people?

1878
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:26,380
If I bring this out, would it shoot this instead?

1879
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:27,140
If I bring this out, would it shoot this instead?

1880
01:18:27,140 --> 01:18:27,880
I don't know.

1881
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:30,160
Oh!

1882
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:30,880
No, no!

1883
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:31,520
That doesn't work!

1884
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:32,360
That doesn't work!

1885
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:36,020
That doesn't work!

1886
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:38,140
Okay.

1887
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:40,600
I never finish port...

1888
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:41,780
Wait, where did I come from?

1889
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:43,400
Oh, I came from here!

1890
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:44,660
Okay.

1891
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:45,940
Please.

1892
01:18:45,940 --> 01:18:46,220
Please.

1893
01:18:51,220 --> 01:18:51,660
Wait.

1894
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:53,320
Can this block?

1895
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:00,620
Oh!

1896
01:19:00,620 --> 01:19:01,060
This...

1897
01:19:01,060 --> 01:19:01,540
Wait, no.

1898
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:01,980
Wait.

1899
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:03,160
I thought this blocks...

1900
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:03,740
Does this block?

1901
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:04,540
Does this block me?

1902
01:19:05,820 --> 01:19:06,760
Oh, it blocks!

1903
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:07,360
It blocks it!

1904
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:08,580
Wait, wait, wait.

1905
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:09,920
Wait, wait, wait.

1906
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:12,280
Please, please, please.

1907
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:15,160
Oh, it does not block it.

1908
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:18,280
It does not block this.

1909
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:19,260
Me.

1910
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:22,600
Wait, it can't even...

1911
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:23,900
Please give it back to me.

1912
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:25,520
Okay.

1913
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:27,380
Okay, okay.

1914
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:28,840
What do I do?

1915
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:33,140
I'm bringing...

1916
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:34,860
Am I bringing this over?

1917
01:19:53,490 --> 01:19:54,090
Okay.

1918
01:19:54,090 --> 01:19:54,690
Okay.

1919
01:19:55,010 --> 01:19:56,310
Are you still there?

1920
01:19:56,310 --> 01:19:57,470
I'm just gonna rush.

1921
01:19:57,550 --> 01:19:58,210
I'm just gonna rush.

1922
01:19:58,310 --> 01:19:58,690
I'm just gonna rush.

1923
01:20:00,890 --> 01:20:01,330
Okay.

1924
01:20:02,190 --> 01:20:02,630
Okay.

1925
01:20:03,550 --> 01:20:03,990
Okay.

1926
01:20:04,170 --> 01:20:04,270
Okay.

1927
01:20:04,270 --> 01:20:04,670
I'm rushing.

1928
01:20:04,830 --> 01:20:05,130
I'm rushing.

1929
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:05,590
I'm rushing.

1930
01:20:06,210 --> 01:20:08,830
Oh, I did not bring this past me.

1931
01:20:10,850 --> 01:20:12,790
I didn't even bring this...

1932
01:20:13,270 --> 01:20:14,450
How do I get here?

1933
01:20:15,730 --> 01:20:17,270
How do I get here?

1934
01:20:17,770 --> 01:20:18,370
How do I get here?

1935
01:20:20,770 --> 01:20:22,390
Why did I bring this here?

1936
01:20:24,850 --> 01:20:25,290
Okay.

1937
01:20:25,450 --> 01:20:26,290
I'm just gonna rush.

1938
01:20:26,870 --> 01:20:27,910
What are they gonna do?

1939
01:20:27,950 --> 01:20:28,470
Shoot me?

1940
01:20:29,870 --> 01:20:30,670
Yeah, that's right.

1941
01:20:31,170 --> 01:20:31,610
That's right.

1942
01:20:31,730 --> 01:20:32,150
No!

1943
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:32,490
No!

1944
01:20:32,550 --> 01:20:32,830
Wait!

1945
01:20:32,950 --> 01:20:33,130
How?

1946
01:20:33,510 --> 01:20:33,930
How?

1947
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:35,610
Oh, I broke it!

1948
01:20:35,710 --> 01:20:36,010
Yes!

1949
01:20:36,150 --> 01:20:36,750
Yeah, bitch!

1950
01:20:38,130 --> 01:20:38,890
I broke it.

1951
01:20:38,950 --> 01:20:39,450
I broke it.

1952
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:40,570
I broke it.

1953
01:20:42,090 --> 01:20:42,870
That was planned.

1954
01:20:43,090 --> 01:20:43,870
I planned that.

1955
01:20:44,830 --> 01:20:45,730
Wait, do I get...

1956
01:20:45,730 --> 01:20:47,610
How much HP do I...

1957
01:20:47,610 --> 01:20:48,710
How much HP do I have?

1958
01:20:48,730 --> 01:20:49,670
Can I just keep breaking this?

1959
01:20:50,570 --> 01:20:51,830
I'm just gonna keep breaking these.

1960
01:20:51,890 --> 01:20:52,250
Fuck that.

1961
01:20:52,630 --> 01:20:53,050
Oh!

1962
01:20:53,050 --> 01:20:54,490
Wait, wait, wait.

1963
01:20:54,490 --> 01:20:54,730
No, no.

1964
01:20:54,810 --> 01:20:55,550
He heard me.

1965
01:20:55,770 --> 01:20:56,630
He heard me.

1966
01:20:57,730 --> 01:20:58,670
Yeah, that's right.

1967
01:20:58,950 --> 01:20:59,650
That's right.

1968
01:20:59,870 --> 01:21:00,470
That's right.

1969
01:21:06,050 --> 01:21:07,290
What the fuck?

1970
01:21:07,450 --> 01:21:07,870
What the fuck?

1971
01:21:08,890 --> 01:21:10,670
I didn't just break these!

1972
01:21:12,010 --> 01:21:13,030
Can you pick them up?

1973
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:14,530
Oh my god, I didn't pick them up.

1974
01:21:17,290 --> 01:21:19,650
And then she dies from a dying turd.

1975
01:21:20,030 --> 01:21:20,590
Okay, okay.

1976
01:21:21,250 --> 01:21:22,890
All I have to do is just...

1977
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:25,690
I'm sorry.

1978
01:21:25,770 --> 01:21:27,630
I should have tried to knock him over earlier.

1979
01:21:28,770 --> 01:21:29,210
Okay.

1980
01:21:29,850 --> 01:21:30,610
Wait, wait, wait.

1981
01:21:51,140 --> 01:21:51,900
Okay, wait.

1982
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:52,920
What if I use these?

1983
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:54,760
What if I use these to knock them over?

1984
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:55,080
Okay.

1985
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,140
Oh shit!

1986
01:21:56,340 --> 01:21:58,860
No, please, please, please, please.

1987
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:00,060
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1988
01:22:00,140 --> 01:22:02,380
And then I do this here.

1989
01:22:02,540 --> 01:22:03,680
Like this.

1990
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:08,400
And then I'm gonna go break this one.

1991
01:22:08,780 --> 01:22:09,200
Okay.

1992
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:09,560
Okay.

1993
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:13,120
And then I go...

1994
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:15,280
And then...

1995
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:16,920
And then...

1996
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:20,500
This is how you do it!

1997
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:21,860
And then...

1998
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:24,040
Oh my god, I'm so smart!

1999
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:25,860
I'm so smart!

2000
01:22:26,140 --> 01:22:27,140
I'm so smart!

2001
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:32,460
Is this really how you do it?

2002
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:33,880
Or am I just breaking the game?

2003
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:36,380
Am I breaking the game right now?

2004
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:38,880
This is actually...

2005
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:40,840
Oh, this is actually...

2006
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:42,740
Wait.

01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:57,380
Okay.

2011
01:22:58,900 --> 01:22:59,400
Yeah.

2012
01:23:02,410 --> 01:23:03,390
Wait, wait, wait.

2013
01:23:03,470 --> 01:23:04,530
You're not supposed to... Wait, wait.

2014
01:23:07,630 --> 01:23:09,170
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

2015
01:23:09,450 --> 01:23:10,230
Wait a minute.

2016
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:19,280
Wait a minute.

2017
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,100
Oh my god, I'm so smart!

2018
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:40,240
Oh my god, I'm so smart!

2019
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:41,380

Look at that!

2023
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:49,680
Navajo collection of kids!

2024
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:54,750
Oh my god.

2025
01:23:54,970 --> 01:23:56,830
I'm so fucking smart.

2026
01:23:57,030 --> 01:23:58,350
I don't need portals.

2027
01:23:58,630 --> 01:24:00,410

2028
01:24:00,890 --> 01:24:01,690

01:24:14,030 --> 01:24:15,570
This is such a back road!

2035
01:24:15,810 --> 01:24:17,510
Wait, is this not how you do it?

2036
01:24:18,270 --> 01:24:19,810
Is this how you play the game?

2037
01:24:20,190 --> 01:24:21,850
How else are you supposed to do this?

2038
01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:27,430
Wait, okay, okay.

2039
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:31,090
How else am I supposed...

2040
01:24:32,190 --> 01:24:33,450
I wish I didn't do that.

2041
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:33,990
Okay, wait.

Alright.

01:24:46,470 --> 01:24:47,570
How do I do this?

2049
01:24:50,950 --> 01:24:52,790
There's no other ways to do it, that's why I...

I'm just regen HP.

2061
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:30,080
No!

2062
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:34,020
No, I didn't reach it!

2063
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:34,860
No, I didn't reach it!

2064
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:36,140
I didn't reach it!

2065
01:25:37,260 --> 01:25:39,220
I was like, I'm just gonna die behind it.

2066
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:40,080
Thank you.

2067
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:42,920
Oh, thank you so much for the follow, Deluxon.

2068
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:43,960
Thank you, thank you.

2069
01:25:44,540 --> 01:25:46,500
Have a... have a...

2070
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:46,940
fun heart.

2071
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:48,120
Thank you so much.

2072
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:49,180
Wait, wait.

2073
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:50,740
I just need another companion cube.

2074
01:25:50,940 --> 01:25:51,620
I just need another.

2075
01:25:52,860 --> 01:25:54,860
Chat says she can beat Portal.

2076
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:56,260
Without Portals.

2077
01:25:56,420 --> 01:25:57,980
I don't need Portals!

2078
01:25:58,120 --> 01:25:58,840
Look at that!

2079
01:25:59,700 --> 01:26:01,000
This hasn't failed me yet!

2080
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:02,200
No, no, no!

2081
01:26:14,850 --> 01:26:15,810
Okay, maybe...

2082
01:26:16,910 --> 01:26:18,030
Maybe it has...

2083
01:26:18,030 --> 01:26:18,510
failed me.

2084
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:19,650
Maybe...

2085
01:26:20,390 --> 01:26:22,150
Maybe it has failed me, chat.

2086
01:26:22,950 --> 01:26:23,350
Maybe...

2087
01:26:23,850 --> 01:26:25,370
Maybe it has failed me.

2088
01:26:25,490 --> 01:26:26,930
But we can do this again.

2089
01:26:29,730 --> 01:26:30,950
Let me get rid of...

2090
01:26:30,950 --> 01:26:32,390
Let me get rid of this guy.

2091
01:26:33,670 --> 01:26:34,630
Boom, there we go.

2092
01:26:34,670 --> 01:26:35,070
Look at that.

2093
01:26:36,850 --> 01:26:37,650
And then...

2094
01:26:39,690 --> 01:26:40,490
And then...

2095
01:26:42,790 --> 01:26:43,190
And

2096
01:26:46,290 --> 01:26:46,690
then...

2097
01:26:46,690 --> 01:26:47,950
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2098
01:26:48,050 --> 01:26:48,970
Wait, wait, wait.

2099
01:26:49,510 --> 01:26:50,370
Wait, I just need one.

2100
01:26:51,610 --> 01:26:52,290
Okay, okay.

2101
01:26:54,510 --> 01:26:54,870
Searching.

2102
01:26:55,230 --> 01:26:55,590
Searching.

2103
01:26:56,050 --> 01:26:56,410
Alright.

2104
01:26:57,390 --> 01:26:57,750
Okay.

2105
01:26:59,670 --> 01:27:00,030
Okay.

2106
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:03,070
No, please, please.

2107
01:27:03,350 --> 01:27:03,930
Please, okay.

2108
01:27:04,070 --> 01:27:05,170
All I need to do...

2109
01:27:05,170 --> 01:27:07,210
is just...

2110
01:27:07,210 --> 01:27:08,230
Do you have enough cubes?

2111
01:27:09,450 --> 01:27:09,810
Exactly!

2112
01:27:11,210 --> 01:27:12,730
Exactly, I just need a cube of walls.

2113
01:27:12,770 --> 01:27:13,430
This was my plan.

2114
01:27:15,770 --> 01:27:16,370
There you go.

2115
01:27:16,810 --> 01:27:17,530
Please, please.

2116
01:27:17,670 --> 01:27:18,010
Please.

2117
01:27:18,310 --> 01:27:18,670
Okay.

2118
01:27:18,990 --> 01:27:20,630
Okay, I have like 20 of these.

2119
01:27:20,710 --> 01:27:21,490
I have 20 of these.

2120
01:27:21,610 --> 01:27:23,090
There's no way I can fuck up.

2121
01:27:23,270 --> 01:27:25,050
There's no way I can fuck this up.

2122
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:27,730
Yeah, that's right.

2123
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:29,210
That's right.

2124
01:27:29,930 --> 01:27:30,670
That's right.

2125
01:27:35,070 --> 01:27:37,330
Thank you so much for the follow pass.

2126
01:27:37,610 --> 01:27:38,390
Thank you, thank you.

2127
01:27:38,490 --> 01:27:39,790
I really do appreciate it.

2128
01:27:40,410 --> 01:27:41,610
Have a fun, alright.

2129
01:27:41,790 --> 01:27:42,830
Thank you so much.

2130
01:27:43,050 --> 01:27:43,330
Okay.

2131
01:27:43,710 --> 01:27:44,190
Okay.

2132
01:27:45,710 --> 01:27:47,630
Why else would he give us 20 cubes?

2133
01:27:48,050 --> 01:27:50,390
There's no other way to solve this puzzle.

2134
01:27:50,890 --> 01:27:51,590
There's no other way to solve this puzzle.

2135
01:27:51,610 --> 01:27:52,870
There's no other way to solve this.

2136
01:27:54,950 --> 01:27:55,670
I re...

2137
01:27:57,310 --> 01:27:58,690
I refuse to believe.

2138
01:27:59,350 --> 01:28:00,150
I refuse to believe.

2139
01:28:00,150 --> 01:28:00,470
No way.

2140
01:28:01,370 --> 01:28:03,030
Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2141
01:28:03,050 --> 01:28:04,810
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2142
01:28:04,910 --> 01:28:06,650
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2143
01:28:06,650 --> 01:28:07,470
I'm regening HP.

2144
01:28:07,950 --> 01:28:09,910
Can't kill me if I'm regening HP.

2145
01:28:10,610 --> 01:28:10,650
Can't kill me if I'm regening HP.

2146
01:28:11,490 --> 01:28:12,370
Wait, what's this?

2147
01:28:12,670 --> 01:28:14,070
Oh, it's just giving me more cubes.

2148
01:28:14,770 --> 01:28:16,350
Okay, there's no other way.

2149
01:28:16,470 --> 01:28:17,630
I refuse to believe.

2150
01:28:17,930 --> 01:28:19,170
There is another way.

2151
01:28:30,420 --> 01:28:37,760
A fort of Dohki was established in response to the alarming that Braynation pre-properly would go an artificial life this way.

2152
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:38,920
Can we please tell her?

2153
01:28:39,260 --> 01:28:40,080
Look at that.

2154
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:41,180
Look at that.

2155
01:28:41,340 --> 01:28:41,920
Look at that!

2156
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:43,280
He can't even see me!

2157
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:43,920
Stupid!

2158
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:46,280
He can't even see me!

2159
01:28:46,380 --> 01:28:47,260
I have three more!

2160
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:53,700
He can't even see me.

2161
01:28:53,740 --> 01:28:54,640
Look at that shit.

2162
01:28:54,700 --> 01:28:55,240
Look at that.

2163
01:28:55,460 --> 01:28:56,300
Look at that!

2164
01:28:56,780 --> 01:28:57,520
Oh, he don't even know what he's doing.

2165
01:28:57,540 --> 01:28:58,480
He don't know where I am, huh?

2166
01:28:59,000 --> 01:28:59,680
Yeah, you fuck.

2167
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:00,540
Oh, no, no, no, no.

2168
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:01,700
Wait, wait, no, no, no.

2169
01:29:02,780 --> 01:29:05,200
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2170
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:06,080
Wait.

2171
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:09,680
Yeah, he can't even get me!

2172
01:29:09,860 --> 01:29:10,840
One gas bitch!

2173
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:11,820
Look at that!

2174
01:29:12,660 --> 01:29:14,400
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2175
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:15,400
Okay.

2176
01:29:20,420 --> 01:29:22,680
Okay, I'm not gonna bait them anymore.

2177
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:24,120
I'm not gonna bait them anymore.

2178
01:29:24,180 --> 01:29:24,680
I still have two more.

2179
01:29:25,380 --> 01:29:26,400
Okay, this is it.

2180
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:26,860
This is...

2181
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:28,460
This is it.

2182
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:29,020
Oh my god.

2183
01:29:34,390 --> 01:29:34,870
Okay.

2184
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:35,350
Okay.

2185
01:29:35,510 --> 01:29:36,030
This hurts.

2186
01:29:36,130 --> 01:29:37,230
What do you mean, Jedrick?

2187
01:29:37,650 --> 01:29:40,290
This... Why else would they give me, like, two forts?

2188
01:29:40,570 --> 01:29:41,590
Seven queues?

2189
01:29:41,670 --> 01:29:43,730
They gave me seven queues, Jedrick.

2190
01:29:43,870 --> 01:29:45,890
What the fuck am I supposed to do with them?

2191
01:29:46,130 --> 01:29:46,490
Huh?

2192
01:29:46,870 --> 01:29:47,350
Build...

2193
01:29:47,350 --> 01:29:48,910
I'm supposed to build a fort!

2194
01:29:49,730 --> 01:29:50,550
What else?

2195
01:29:51,130 --> 01:29:52,190
Why push it like this?

2196
01:29:52,290 --> 01:29:52,930
Oh my god.

2197
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:00,520
Please.

2198
01:30:22,100 --> 01:30:23,540
How do I get...

2199
01:30:24,100 --> 01:30:24,960
No!

2200
01:30:25,100 --> 01:30:25,440
Wait!

2201
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:27,720
There's one here!

2202
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:29,300
No!

2203
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:33,360
There's one here!

2204
01:30:34,580 --> 01:30:35,300
No!

2205
01:30:36,260 --> 01:30:37,940
My fort!

2206
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:41,520
My fort!

2207
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:47,240
I spent so long...

2208
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:49,560
making the fort!

2209
01:30:52,140 --> 01:30:52,760
No!

2210
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:59,260
How was I supposed to know there was one more?

2211
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:02,480
How was I...

2212
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:06,740
How was I supposed to know there was one more?

2213
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:15,260
How was I...

2214
01:31:15,260 --> 01:31:16,080
Why are you shooting me?

2215
01:31:17,480 --> 01:31:18,100
Okay.

2216
01:31:18,940 --> 01:31:19,560
Okay.

2217
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:22,880
How am I gonna do it?

2218
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:23,860
What the fuck?

2219
01:31:28,140 --> 01:31:28,560
Okay.

2220
01:31:32,030 --> 01:31:32,450
Okay.

2221
01:31:32,630 --> 01:31:32,770
Okay.

2222
01:31:32,830 --> 01:31:33,010
Okay.

2223
01:31:33,290 --> 01:31:34,810
I'm not gonna make the fort again.

2224
01:31:34,910 --> 01:31:36,310
I'm not gonna make the fort again.

2225
01:31:36,370 --> 01:31:37,650
But I still need these queues.

2226
01:31:38,070 --> 01:31:39,710
I still need these queues.

2227
01:31:42,270 --> 01:31:42,690
Okay.

2228
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:43,210
Alright.

2229
01:31:43,470 --> 01:31:43,870
Alright.

2230
01:31:47,810 --> 01:31:48,230
Geometry.

2231
01:31:48,630 --> 01:31:49,050
Okay.

2232
01:31:52,570 --> 01:31:52,990
Okay.

2233
01:31:52,990 --> 01:31:53,310
Wait.

2234
01:31:53,450 --> 01:31:53,550
Wait.

2235
01:31:53,570 --> 01:31:54,030
Let me...

2236
01:31:55,230 --> 01:31:55,230
Wait.

2237
01:31:55,370 --> 01:31:55,990
This way is better.

2238
01:31:56,010 --> 01:31:56,570
This way is better.

2239
01:31:56,570 --> 01:31:57,290
Not this way.

2240
01:32:00,330 --> 01:32:00,850
Okay.

2241
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:05,760
Alright.

2242
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:06,540
Alright.

2243
01:32:07,460 --> 01:32:09,160
What would you even do?

2244
01:32:09,340 --> 01:32:10,740
This is a game mechanic.

2245
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:13,920
They gave us 20 queues for a reason, chat.

2246
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:18,220
There is a reason why they gave us 20 queues.

2247
01:32:20,060 --> 01:32:20,580
Okay.

2248
01:32:25,020 --> 01:32:25,540
Okay.

2249
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:25,740
Okay.

2250
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:31,100
I'll never play the game so if I do, I'll play it like this.

2251
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:32,220
There's a...

2252
01:32:32,220 --> 01:32:35,800
There's not a reason you're thinking that there is a reason.

2253
01:32:41,020 --> 01:32:41,480
Please.

2254
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:43,480
Please, let me just...

2255
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:45,860
Okay.

2256
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:46,280
Okay.

2257
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:46,540
Okay.

2258
01:32:46,540 --> 01:32:46,780
Okay.

2259
01:32:47,540 --> 01:32:48,780
I'm trying... I'm thinking here.

2260
01:32:48,940 --> 01:32:49,940
I'm trying to think.

2261
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:51,820
I made this fort for a reason.

2262
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:54,740
Wait.

2263
01:32:54,740 --> 01:32:55,140
Wait.

2264
01:32:55,220 --> 01:32:55,300
Wait.

2265
01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:55,600
No.

2266
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:56,060
Wait.

2267
01:32:56,160 --> 01:32:56,540
Wait.

2268
01:32:56,620 --> 01:32:57,080
Wait.

2269
01:32:57,100 --> 01:32:57,360
Please.

2270
01:32:57,540 --> 01:32:57,840
Wait.

2271
01:32:57,900 --> 01:32:58,200
Please.

2272
01:32:58,740 --> 01:32:59,480
I have a fort.

2273
01:32:59,620 --> 01:33:00,040
Please.

2274
01:33:00,340 --> 01:33:00,760
Please.

2275
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:03,100
I'm trying to think here.

2276
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:04,680
I have a fort.

2277
01:33:04,900 --> 01:33:06,360
I need to think here.

2278
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:07,400
Okay.

2279
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:08,560
Okay.

2280
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:09,320
So...

2281
01:33:12,820 --> 01:33:13,340
Okay.

2282
01:33:13,340 --> 01:33:13,860
Okay.

2283
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:14,860
Okay.

2284
01:33:15,180 --> 01:33:16,160
Let me think.

2285
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:17,700
Let me think here.

2286
01:33:28,820 --> 01:33:29,340
Here?

2287
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:29,860
No.

2288
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:30,420
Wait.

2289
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:30,540
No.

2290
01:33:30,620 --> 01:33:31,560
It's still looking at me.

2291
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:32,940
Wait.

2292
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:33,440
Wait.

2293
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:33,920
Wait.

2294
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:34,480
Wait.

2295
01:33:34,620 --> 01:33:35,060
Wait.

2296
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:35,520
Wait.

2297
01:33:37,180 --> 01:33:37,620
Alright.

2298
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:40,120
Thank you so much for stopping by.

2299
01:33:40,380 --> 01:33:42,040
I really do appreciate it.

2300
01:33:42,140 --> 01:33:44,360
I hope you get nice dress and good luck with work tomorrow.

2301
01:33:44,620 --> 01:33:45,060
Okay.

2302
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:47,080
Uh...

2303
01:33:50,180 --> 01:33:50,620
Please.

2304
01:33:55,640 --> 01:33:57,500
What do I do with this fort?

2305
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:02,120
What do I do with this fort?

2306
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:02,860
What do I do with this fort?

2307
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:04,560
Please.

2308
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:06,780
Wait.

2309
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:17,350
Wait.

2310
01:34:17,430 --> 01:34:17,630
Wait.

2311
01:34:17,790 --> 01:34:18,270
Wait.

2312
01:34:18,330 --> 01:34:18,670
This is it.

2313
01:34:20,890 --> 01:34:21,370
Goodbye.

2314
01:34:21,890 --> 01:34:22,370
Wait.

2315
01:34:22,650 --> 01:34:23,130
Wait.

2316
01:34:23,370 --> 01:34:23,850
Wait.

2317
01:34:24,570 --> 01:34:25,050
Wait.

2318
01:34:26,190 --> 01:34:26,670
Wait.

2319
01:34:29,910 --> 01:34:30,590
No no no.

2320
01:34:30,990 --> 01:34:31,930
My fort.

2321
01:34:32,050 --> 01:34:32,450
My fort.

2322
01:34:32,450 --> 01:34:33,350
No!

2323
01:34:33,410 --> 01:34:34,130
No!

2324
01:34:34,870 --> 01:34:35,590
No!

2325
01:34:35,790 --> 01:34:36,510
My fourth!

2326
01:34:48,070 --> 01:34:49,370
I got this.

2327
01:34:49,530 --> 01:34:51,650
I just need to slowly push this...

2328
01:34:52,410 --> 01:34:52,930
Okay.

2329
01:34:54,790 --> 01:34:55,510
Okay.

2330
01:34:55,630 --> 01:34:57,050
I'm slowly...

2331
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:08,880
That's right!

2332
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:10,620
I don't know what it...

2333
01:35:10,620 --> 01:35:11,880
Oh!

2334
01:35:12,260 --> 01:35:13,000
Look at that!

2335
01:35:13,300 --> 01:35:13,760
Okay.

2336
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:13,960
Okay.

2337
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:14,360
Okay.

2338
01:35:14,680 --> 01:35:16,660
I got this.

2339
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:17,460
I got... watch this.

2340
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:17,780
Watch this.

2341
01:35:19,420 --> 01:35:20,820
And then...

2342
01:35:22,620 --> 01:35:23,320
Yeah!

2343
01:35:33,030 --> 01:35:33,570
Yeah!

2344
01:35:34,630 --> 01:35:35,330
Wait!

2345
01:35:37,150 --> 01:35:37,390
Wait!

2346
01:35:37,410 --> 01:35:37,650
Wait!

2347
01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:39,450
Yeah!

2348
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:46,060
Yeah!

2349
01:35:49,980 --> 01:35:50,100
Okay.

2350
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:55,820
Look at that!

2351
01:35:55,940 --> 01:35:56,960
Look at that!

2352
01:35:57,340 --> 01:35:59,140
That's a Q-Series for a reason!

2353
01:36:01,540 --> 01:36:02,560
That's a Q-Series.

2354
01:36:02,620 --> 01:36:03,140
Look at that!

2355
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:04,820
Look at that shit!

2356
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:06,960
Look at that!

2357
01:36:07,180 --> 01:36:08,940
I conquered the drones!

2358
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:11,280
I did it!

2359
01:36:11,780 --> 01:36:13,820
I don't need no portal!

2360
01:36:14,660 --> 01:36:17,380
I have a... I have a fucking port!

2361
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:19,780
Who the fuck needs port?

2362
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:21,040
Look at that!

2363
01:36:21,740 --> 01:36:23,720
Look at... Oh, I need my cube.

2364
01:36:23,820 --> 01:36:24,580
I need my cube.

2365
01:36:26,980 --> 01:36:27,380
Wait.

2366
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:28,280
How do I get rid of this?

2367
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:29,240
Wait a minute.

2368
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:30,880
Okay.

2369
01:36:30,900 --> 01:36:31,040
Wait.

2370
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:32,100
I think I need portals here.

2371
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:32,840
Wait.

2372
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:33,820
How do I get rid of this?

2373
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:35,400
Oh...

2374
01:36:40,050 --> 01:36:40,450
Oh...

2375
01:36:41,730 --> 01:36:42,950
I... I get it.

2376
01:36:42,970 --> 01:36:43,250
I see.

2377
01:36:43,430 --> 01:36:43,830
I see.

2378
01:36:43,890 --> 01:36:44,630
I need a...

2379
01:36:45,970 --> 01:36:46,790
Look at this.

2380
01:36:47,550 --> 01:36:48,150
Oh no.

2381
01:36:49,070 --> 01:36:49,470
Yeah!

2382
01:36:53,350 --> 01:36:54,830
I need no portal!

2383
01:36:55,310 --> 01:36:57,210
I didn't need a single portal!

2384
01:36:57,570 --> 01:36:59,770
Except for that one portal that I made.

2385
01:37:04,950 --> 01:37:06,570
Yeah, that's right.

2386
01:37:06,950 --> 01:37:07,890
That's right.

2387
01:37:08,110 --> 01:37:09,410
Look at that shit!

2388
01:37:09,630 --> 01:37:11,690
I didn't need a single portal!

2389
01:37:12,090 --> 01:37:13,390
I didn't...

2390
01:37:13,390 --> 01:37:14,530
I didn't...

2391
01:37:15,730 --> 01:37:18,290
Is this what it means?

2392
01:37:18,290 --> 01:37:19,830
Zero-disc seed run incoming.

2393
01:37:20,550 --> 01:37:21,450
Look at that.

2394
01:37:21,710 --> 01:37:23,930
I can do that for the other one.

2395
01:37:26,310 --> 01:37:28,530
I didn't need a single portal!

2396
01:37:31,350 --> 01:37:32,650
Look at that shit.

2397
01:37:32,890 --> 01:37:33,210
See?

2398
01:37:33,550 --> 01:37:36,070
All I needed was a port of cubes.

2399
01:37:36,610 --> 01:37:37,390
I didn't...

2400
01:37:38,270 --> 01:37:39,650
You dropped it...

2401
01:37:39,650 --> 01:37:42,090
You dropped the cubes on the drone.

2402
01:37:42,350 --> 01:37:44,090
There was literally an X.

2403
01:37:44,450 --> 01:37:45,090
Wait.

2404
01:37:45,190 --> 01:37:45,410
What?

2405
01:37:45,730 --> 01:37:46,290
Wait.

2406
01:37:46,350 --> 01:37:48,350
I didn't need to build a portal.

2407
01:37:48,810 --> 01:37:53,230
I didn't need to slowly push the cubes into the...

2408
01:37:54,230 --> 01:37:55,410
Yeah, but...

2409
01:37:55,410 --> 01:37:57,510
I had to see that chamber in this one.

2410
01:37:57,590 --> 01:37:58,610
Please take care of it.

2411
01:37:58,710 --> 01:38:00,310
My fort was too strong.

2412
01:38:01,130 --> 01:38:03,050
Fort... cubes together... strong.

2413
01:38:06,690 --> 01:38:08,550
There's little morphe on the ceiling.

2414
01:38:08,550 --> 01:38:10,310
Like a rip with the portal.

2415
01:38:10,690 --> 01:38:12,130
I don't need instructions!

2416
01:38:13,290 --> 01:38:14,450
Who do you think...

2417
01:38:14,450 --> 01:38:16,010
Who do you think you're talking to?

2418
01:38:16,130 --> 01:38:17,370
How the fuck do I get up here?

2419
01:38:17,870 --> 01:38:19,450
You think I need instructions?

2420
01:38:20,450 --> 01:38:21,570
I don't need that!

2421
01:38:21,570 --> 01:38:23,250
I make my own rules!

2422
01:38:23,850 --> 01:38:24,730
Look at that!

2423
01:38:25,310 --> 01:38:27,230
I make my own fucking rules!

2424
01:38:27,810 --> 01:38:28,470
Look at that!

2425
01:38:30,070 --> 01:38:32,650
I'm difficult but don't think I'm watching...

2426
01:38:32,650 --> 01:38:33,390
...Teeth Chat.

2427
01:38:33,650 --> 01:38:35,210
It's together strong!

2428
01:38:35,570 --> 01:38:36,170
Exactly!

2429
01:38:37,450 --> 01:38:38,750
I can just do this.

2430
01:38:39,230 --> 01:38:40,330
What's this gonna do?

2431
01:38:40,370 --> 01:38:40,970
Kill me?

2432
01:38:41,370 --> 01:38:48,910
The symptoms most commonly produced by enrichment center testing are superstition, Actually, Doki and Azuri can't roll.

2433
01:38:49,530 --> 01:38:51,230
Doki don't need to use a poem.

2434
01:38:51,570 --> 01:38:59,310
The enrichment center reminds you that the weighted companion cube will never threaten to stab you and, in fact, cannot speak.

2435
01:39:00,030 --> 01:39:00,630
...

2436
01:39:01,470 --> 01:39:03,250
I do not do that.

2437
01:39:03,410 --> 01:39:05,530

This symptoms most commonly produced by enrichment center testing are superstition, Okay, okay.

2450
01:39:34,150 --> 01:39:35,590
...perceiving inanimate objects as alive.

2451
01:39:35,590 --> 01:39:36,170
What's this gonna do?

2452
01:39:36,230 --> 01:39:36,790
Kill me?

2453
01:39:36,870 --> 01:39:37,490
Oh, fuck.

2454
01:39:38,310 --> 01:39:44,150
The enrichment center reminds you that the weighted companion cube will never threaten to stab you and, in fact, cannot speak.

2455
01:39:44,150 --> 01:39:46,790
Okay, I thought I got the timing wrong.

2456
01:39:46,870 --> 01:39:48,870
I thought I got the timing right.

2457
01:39:49,070 --> 01:39:49,670
But I couldn't.

2458
01:39:50,050 --> 01:39:51,550

01:39:51,550 --> 01:39:52,930
It did.

2460
01:39:52,930 --> 01:39:53,130
It did, in fact, kill me.

2461
01:39:53,130 --> 01:40:01,730
This symptoms most commonly produced by enrichment center testing are superstition, perceiving inanimate objects as alive, and hallucinations.

2462
01:40:01,730 --> 01:40:02,830
Let me time this.

2463
01:40:02,830 --> 01:40:10,630
The enrichment center reminds you that the weighted companion cube will never threaten to stab you and, in fact, cannot speak.

2464
01:40:10,630 --> 01:40:11,130
Let me time this.

2465
01:40:12,070 --> 01:40:13,850

2474
01:40:32,170 --> 01:40:33,470

Where is it?

2483
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:06,480
Okay, that's the right way now, but still.

2484
01:41:07,320 --> 01:41:07,960
Oh.

2485
01:41:13,170 --> 01:41:14,310
Okay, okay, okay.

2486
01:41:14,530 --> 01:41:15,530
Okay, okay, okay.

Alright, alright.

2488

2490
01:41:19,930 --> 01:41:21,390
Cube is meta now.

2491
01:41:25,490 --> 01:41:25,810

2509
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:10,920
Hello.

2510
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:12,240

2512
01:42:13,660 --> 01:42:15,040
Where can I acquire?

2513
01:42:15,480 --> 01:42:17,040
A second cube.

2514
01:42:17,380 --> 01:42:17,880

2515
01:42:20,500 --> 01:42:21,460

01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:35,760
Cube!

2520
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:36,960
Wait.

2521
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:38,140
Oh, okay, wait, wait.

2522
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:39,480
Hahaha.

01:42:42,360 --> 01:42:43,800
I was just at the other.

2524
01:42:43,900 --> 01:42:45,260
I'm not reinforcing this.

2525
01:42:45,720 --> 01:42:46,600
Again, I...

2526
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:52,340
Hey, have you guys heard this new intro called Doki Doki?

2527
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:53,240
I heard good things.

2528
01:42:53,540 --> 01:42:54,400
Oh my god.

Where's the other one?

2531
01:42:59,980 --> 01:43:00,900
How do I get up there?

2532
01:43:00,940 --> 01:43:01,360
Oh!

2533
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:02,400

01:43:15,090 --> 01:43:16,150
Wait, what's this?

2539
01:43:24,120 --> 01:43:25,620
Wait, wait, I went backwards!

2540
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:26,540
No, no!

2541
01:43:28,220 --> 01:43:29,660
I was here!

2542
01:43:31,900 --> 01:43:34,160
I think I already broke my mind.

2543
01:43:35,140 --> 01:43:37,600
I didn't realize I just went backwards.

2544
01:43:41,140 --> 01:43:41,700
Wait.

2545
01:43:42,300 --> 01:43:43,480
What do I get here?

2546
01:43:46,280 --> 01:43:47,900
No more booms.

2547
01:43:50,980 --> 01:43:53,080
I don't get booms.

2548
01:43:53,300 --> 01:43:54,960
I don't get

2549
01:44:11,500 --> 01:44:11,880

2550
01:44:13,620 --> 01:44:14,960
I don't get booms.

2551
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:15,440
What?

2552
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:16,600
What?

2553
01:44:16,680 --> 01:44:17,100
Where do I get...

2554
01:44:17,100 --> 01:44:18,060
Hello?

2555
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:20,540
Hello?

2556
01:44:22,100 --> 01:44:24,360
These are nonexisting...

2557
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:25,560
Oh, believe me.

2558
01:44:25,820 --> 01:44:26,480
Yeah.

2559
01:44:26,900 --> 01:44:29,140
It's already happening right now.

2560
01:44:29,360 --> 01:44:30,460
Right meow.

2561
01:44:32,300 --> 01:44:32,380
Wait.

2562
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:33,640
Why is there a button here?

2563
01:44:34,900 --> 01:44:36,240
Where did you come from?

2564
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:38,860
I know it.

2565
01:44:38,940 --> 01:44:40,340
As you don't know how to play it, like, don't you?

2566
01:44:41,080 --> 01:44:41,440

My brain.

2570
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:48,720
My brain.

2571
01:44:48,820 --> 01:44:49,200
My brain.

2572
01:44:49,340 --> 01:44:50,760
My brain big, big.

2573
01:44:51,060 --> 01:44:51,900
My brain big.

2574
01:44:52,380 --> 01:44:53,080
Don't worry, chat.

2575
01:44:53,140 --> 01:44:53,800
Watch this, chat.

2576
01:44:55,080 --> 01:44:55,660

2578
01:44:57,200 --> 01:44:57,760
I get it now.

2579
01:44:58,280 --> 01:44:58,980
I get it.

2580
01:45:00,900 --> 01:45:02,340
Okay, I need to go back up.

2581
01:45:03,460 --> 01:45:04,540
I go here.

2582
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:06,060

2583
01:45:06,820 --> 01:45:07,560
Yes, chat?

2584
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:10,800
And then...

2585
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:11,760
Uh...

2586
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:14,300
There ain't no port of mass protection.

2587
01:45:15,240 --> 01:45:16,240
And then...

2588
01:45:16,860 --> 01:45:18,820
And then I go...

2589
01:45:20,980 --> 01:45:23,700
Hell, this game, if I had a port-o-gun, I would...

2590
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:25,200
Okay, okay.

2591
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:26,160
Bro, come over here.

2592
01:45:26,160 --> 01:45:26,680
Come on.

2593
01:45:26,700 --> 01:45:27,420
Come on.

2594
01:45:27,900 --> 01:45:28,480
Come on.

2595
01:45:29,500 --> 01:45:30,020
Bro.

2596
01:45:30,300 --> 01:45:30,980
Come on.

2597
01:45:32,380 --> 01:45:32,900
Yeah.

2598
01:45:32,900 --> 01:45:33,580
That's right.

2599
01:45:34,260 --> 01:45:34,780
Oh!

2600
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:37,120
Okay.

2601
01:45:40,180 --> 01:45:40,700
Um...

2602
01:45:40,700 --> 01:45:43,180
Yeah, that was... that wasn't it.

2603
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:44,940
That was... that wasn't it.

2604
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:46,600
That wasn't...

2605
01:45:48,120 --> 01:45:49,640
This is why I hate coming late.

2606
01:45:49,700 --> 01:45:51,740
Instead of that guy that she dead.

2607
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:53,440
Okay.

2608
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:56,080
I'm sorry that she found the best way to play.

2609
01:45:56,160 --> 01:45:57,480
Wait, does that do us again?

2610
01:45:57,820 --> 01:45:58,420
Wait, no.

2611
01:45:58,460 --> 01:45:58,880
I don't.

2612
01:45:58,940 --> 01:45:59,340
I don't.

2613
01:45:59,620 --> 01:46:00,060
Oh!

2614
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:02,400
Wait, never mind.

2615
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:03,780
I thought you could go through here.

2616
01:46:05,740 --> 01:46:07,860
I thought you could go through here.

2617
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:11,440
This game is not port and not cute for a reason.

2618
01:46:12,920 --> 01:46:13,360
Wait.

2619
01:46:13,820 --> 01:46:14,260
Wait!

2620
01:46:14,920 --> 01:46:15,700
Wait, chat.

I know what to do now.

2625
01:46:22,620 --> 01:46:23,200
I know.

2626
01:46:23,220 --> 01:46:23,480
I know.

2627
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:24,720
My brain expanding, chat.

2628
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:25,720
Wait.

2629
01:46:26,160 --> 01:46:26,660
My brain.

2630
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:28,380
My brain expanding.

2631
01:46:33,940 --> 01:46:35,020
My brain expanding.

2632
01:46:35,200 --> 01:46:35,740
Okay.

2633
01:46:35,900 --> 01:46:36,440
Alright.

2634
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:37,300
Alright.

2635
01:46:37,660 --> 01:46:38,200
Okay.

2636
01:46:38,240 --> 01:46:39,800
My brain is not... wait.

2637
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:42,480
You can put a portal there?

2638
01:46:43,140 --> 01:46:43,680
What?

2639
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:45,660
Oh my god!

2640
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:46,180
Wait!

2641
01:46:47,480 --> 01:46:48,300
Wait, wait, wait.

2642
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:49,660
Let me double check if this works.

2643
01:46:50,060 --> 01:46:51,300
I need to make sure.

2644
01:46:51,980 --> 01:46:53,160
What the fuck?

2645
01:46:53,260 --> 01:46:53,640
What?

2646
01:46:53,700 --> 01:46:55,440
You can put a portal there?

2647
01:46:56,140 --> 01:46:56,700
Okay.

2648
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:58,640
My brain expanding, chat.

2649
01:46:59,120 --> 01:46:59,680
Okay.

2650
01:46:59,700 --> 01:47:00,940
And then I need it...

2651
01:47:01,560 --> 01:47:02,900
Where do I need this?

2652
01:47:04,120 --> 01:47:05,300
I need it here.

2653
01:47:05,580 --> 01:47:06,140
Alright.

2654
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:07,480
Alright.

2655
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:07,740
Wait.

2656
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:11,840
Where's my cube?

2657
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:13,400
Holy shit.

2658
01:47:13,420 --> 01:47:14,560
I'm so fucking smart.

2659
01:47:15,320 --> 01:47:16,880
And then I put this here.

2660
01:47:18,460 --> 01:47:19,580
And then...

2661
01:47:20,220 --> 01:47:20,780
Wait.

2662
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:23,380
Boom.

2663
01:47:24,220 --> 01:47:25,060
Yeah, that's right.

2664
01:47:25,740 --> 01:47:26,240
BOOM!

2665
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:27,540
Woo!

2666
01:47:30,940 --> 01:47:31,440
Alright.

2667
01:47:34,280 --> 01:47:34,780
Look at that.

2668
01:47:34,780 --> 01:47:36,660
Look at that.

2669
01:47:36,660 --> 01:47:38,600
Look at that.

2670
01:47:39,380 --> 01:47:40,160
First try.

2671
01:47:40,420 --> 01:47:41,460
It's only been 30 minutes.

2672
01:47:41,640 --> 01:47:43,540
We've only been playing this game for 30 minutes.

2673
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:46,060
And we're 90% done with this game already.

2674
01:47:46,360 --> 01:47:47,460
Is that crazy, chat?

2675
01:47:47,900 --> 01:47:49,020
Is that fucking crazy?

2676
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:50,300
Do not trust Nightbot.

2677
01:47:50,380 --> 01:47:51,140
Nightbot is wrong.

2678
01:47:51,140 --> 01:47:52,160
Oh, I needed my cube.

2679
01:47:53,140 --> 01:47:54,560
I needed my cube.

2680
01:47:56,680 --> 01:47:58,460
Sometimes my genius scares me.

2681
01:47:58,560 --> 01:47:59,140
I know.

2682
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:05,040
He said no.

2683
01:48:05,240 --> 01:48:05,460
Wait.

2684
01:48:05,540 --> 01:48:06,720
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2685
01:48:06,940 --> 01:48:07,880
No, no, no, no.

2686
01:48:08,200 --> 01:48:09,240
No, no, no, no, no.

2687
01:48:09,300 --> 01:48:10,380
I've never...

2688
01:48:10,380 --> 01:48:10,940
No, no, no.

2689
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:11,260
Only...

2690
01:48:13,220 --> 01:48:14,440
40 minutes has passed.

2691
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:16,380
I mean 40 minutes have passed, chat.

2692
01:48:16,820 --> 01:48:17,440
Holy shit.

2693
01:48:17,480 --> 01:48:18,660
40 minutes have passed.

2694
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:20,740
And we're already 90% done with this game.

2695
01:48:20,860 --> 01:48:21,560
Is that crazy?

2696
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:30,680
Oh my god.

2697
01:48:30,680 --> 01:48:32,980
Oh my god.

2698
01:48:32,980 --> 01:48:33,660
Oh my god.

2699
01:48:33,660 --> 01:48:33,660
Help.

2700
01:48:33,660 --> 01:48:34,780
Thank you so much, Willful.

2701
01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:36,060
Thank you.

2702
01:48:36,060 --> 01:48:36,480
Thank you.

2703
01:48:36,500 --> 01:48:37,900
I really do appreciate it.

2704
01:48:38,100 --> 01:48:39,100
Thank you so much.

2705
01:48:39,560 --> 01:48:40,820
Have a boy heart.

2706
01:48:40,980 --> 01:48:41,420
Thank you.

2707
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:41,740
Thank you.

2708
01:48:41,800 --> 01:48:42,100
Thank you.

2709
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:43,120
Okay.

2710
01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:44,500
Well, you want me to burn this cube?

2711
01:48:44,620 --> 01:48:44,820
Yeah.

2712
01:48:44,980 --> 01:48:45,820
You think I care?

2713
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:47,760
You think I give a fuck about this cube?

2714
01:48:47,980 --> 01:48:48,360
Yeah.

2715
01:48:49,080 --> 01:48:49,480
Yeah.

2716
01:48:50,020 --> 01:48:50,860
How do I burn it?

2717
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:51,880
Excuse me?

2718
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:56,160
I said all that?

2719
01:48:56,680 --> 01:48:59,360
I said all that and you're not gonna burn the cube?

2720
01:49:00,060 --> 01:49:13,320
Rest assured that an independent panel of ethicists has absolved the Enrichment Center, Aperture Science employees, and all the researchers of any more or less possibility for the companion cube, euthanizing process.

2721
01:49:13,320 --> 01:49:13,960
Oh my god.

2722
01:49:13,960 --> 01:49:14,580
Just burn it.

2723
01:49:14,660 --> 01:49:14,980
Please.

2724
01:49:15,080 --> 01:49:15,940
I don't care.

2725
01:49:17,480 --> 01:49:18,040
Yeah.

2726
01:49:18,580 --> 01:49:19,320
Oh wait.

2727
01:49:19,380 --> 01:49:20,040
Did I get burned?

2728
01:49:20,040 --> 01:49:21,240
What the fuck?

2729
01:49:21,300 --> 01:49:22,220
Did it burn me?

2730
01:49:22,420 --> 01:49:23,280
What the fuck?

2731
01:49:27,700 --> 01:49:29,660
Why won't it burn the cube?

2732
01:49:30,980 --> 01:49:31,400
Oh.

2733
01:49:31,780 --> 01:49:35,460
Your companion cube cannot accompany you through the rest of the test.

2734
01:49:35,740 --> 01:49:37,100
If it could talk, Wait.

2735
01:49:37,240 --> 01:49:41,160
and the Enrichment Center takes this opportunity to remind you that it cannot.

2736
01:49:41,420 --> 01:49:43,580
It would tell you to go on without it.

2737
01:49:43,660 --> 01:49:43,900
Why wouldn't it burn the cube?

2738
01:49:43,900 --> 01:49:46,920
Because it would rather die in a fire than become a weapon.

2739
01:49:47,060 --> 01:49:47,320
Oh.

2740
01:49:53,300 --> 01:49:54,320
Yeah, you think I...

2741
01:49:54,320 --> 01:49:54,440
Oh!

2742
01:49:54,580 --> 01:49:55,260
What the... No!

2743
01:49:55,420 --> 01:49:55,440
No!

2744
01:49:55,440 --> 01:49:59,860
The Enrichment Center has your faithful companion cube more quickly than any test subject on record.

2745
01:50:00,220 --> 01:50:00,760
Congratulations.

2746
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:06,360
Look, I thought...

2747
01:50:07,720 --> 01:50:09,320
Look, I thought...

2748
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:11,660
I wasn't thinking.

2749
01:50:12,780 --> 01:50:14,460
Okay... Okay, I wasn't thinking.

2750
01:50:15,240 --> 01:50:16,480
I have to do this again!

2751
01:50:17,580 --> 01:50:18,240
Wait, what?

2752
01:50:18,700 --> 01:50:19,240
Oh!

2753
01:50:22,460 --> 01:50:23,680
I'm burning you twice now after that.

2754
01:50:23,820 --> 01:50:25,220
Yeah, you deserve to get burned twice.

2755
01:50:26,420 --> 01:50:27,940
Not this year, this again!

2756
01:50:31,660 --> 01:50:32,460
You know what?

2757
01:50:32,580 --> 01:50:34,480
Yeah, this deserves to get burned twice.

2758
01:50:45,070 --> 01:50:45,510
Okay.

2759
01:50:45,510 --> 01:50:45,950
Alright.

2760
01:50:47,230 --> 01:50:48,890
Are you- DUDE!

2761
01:50:50,810 --> 01:50:52,070
Okay, okay, okay.

2762
01:50:53,110 --> 01:50:53,550
Alright.

2763
01:50:53,870 --> 01:50:54,910
I'm just gonna put you here?

2764
01:50:55,250 --> 01:50:56,010
Putting you here.

2765
01:50:56,510 --> 01:50:56,950
Okay.

2766
01:50:57,510 --> 01:50:59,170
It's too big to hold.

2767
01:50:59,330 --> 01:51:00,590
I have to let it go.

2768
01:51:05,770 --> 01:51:06,730
Alright, alright.

2769
01:51:07,150 --> 01:51:08,050
Round two.

2770
01:51:08,110 --> 01:51:09,390
Round two of burning the cube.

2771
01:51:10,730 --> 01:51:11,690
Round two.

2772
01:51:18,030 --> 01:51:18,550
Okay.

2773
01:51:18,550 --> 01:51:19,210
Alright, cube.

2774
01:51:20,350 --> 01:51:22,630
I already said my goodbyes.

2775
01:51:23,810 --> 01:51:24,330
Bye.

2776
01:51:24,770 --> 01:51:25,810
I don't give a fuck.

2777
01:51:29,370 --> 01:51:30,390
I don't give a fuck.

2778
01:51:30,390 --> 01:51:34,170
Do you think I care?

2779
01:51:39,710 --> 01:51:40,910
No remorse.

2780
01:51:40,950 --> 01:51:41,670
It killed me!

2781
01:51:42,030 --> 01:51:44,750
Why the fuck would I give a shit after that?

2782
01:51:50,610 --> 01:51:53,650
The experiment is nearing its conclusion.

2783
01:51:54,090 --> 01:51:55,330
Wait, there's instructions!

2784
01:51:56,050 --> 01:52:00,670
This requirement will remind you that you will be baked, and then there will be cake.

2785
01:52:00,670 --> 01:52:02,550
Now that you jumped in there, my dude.

2786
01:52:02,850 --> 01:52:03,290
Cube.

2787
01:52:03,370 --> 01:52:09,210
I thought, okay, to be honest, I thought the lava thingy, like, there was like an invisible wall.

2788
01:52:09,430 --> 01:52:12,150
So I wouldn't go down there and the cube would.

2789
01:52:12,250 --> 01:52:15,410
I didn't think when you jumped in with it, you'd die with it.

2790
01:52:15,590 --> 01:52:17,290
I thought it would just take the cube.

2791
01:52:19,690 --> 01:52:20,130
Okay.

2792
01:52:20,650 --> 01:52:21,090
Cube.

2793
01:52:22,070 --> 01:52:22,510
Hit.

2794
01:52:24,650 --> 01:52:25,090
Pit.

2795
01:52:26,070 --> 01:52:28,570
Top 10 anime betrayals.

2796
01:52:29,730 --> 01:52:30,870
Water bad.

2797
01:52:32,670 --> 01:52:33,850
Portal jump.

2798
01:52:35,070 --> 01:52:37,090
Portal drone.

2799
01:52:42,170 --> 01:52:42,890
Okay.

2800
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:49,400
Okay.

2801
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:50,260
What's this?

2802
01:52:53,200 --> 01:52:54,420
Do I go here?

2803
01:52:55,140 --> 01:52:57,500
All employees must wash their hands.

2804
01:53:11,130 --> 01:53:12,610
Oh, wait, is there more here?

2805
01:53:14,070 --> 01:53:14,830
What's this point?

2806
01:53:15,430 --> 01:53:16,150
What?

2807
01:53:17,270 --> 01:53:18,490
What was the point of this?

2808
01:53:20,690 --> 01:53:21,730
Oh, no, no!

2809
01:53:32,120 --> 01:53:35,020
The experiment is nearing its conclusion.

2810
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:42,120
The enrichment center is required to remind you that you will be baked and then there will be cake.

2811
01:53:44,980 --> 01:53:45,560
Okay.

2812
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:46,500
Um.

2813
01:53:47,900 --> 01:53:48,480
Anyway.

2814
01:53:49,100 --> 01:53:50,600
This was first try.

2815
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:52,340
Alright.

2816
01:53:53,340 --> 01:53:55,300
We just don't go over here anymore?

2817
01:53:56,440 --> 01:53:57,380
We just...

2818
01:53:57,380 --> 01:53:59,320
That never existed?

2819
01:54:00,700 --> 01:54:01,120
What?

2820
01:54:08,690 --> 01:54:09,530
What?

2821
01:54:09,570 --> 01:54:10,210
Nothing happened?

2822
01:54:19,820 --> 01:54:20,660
What?

2823
01:54:21,300 --> 01:54:22,140
Oh!

2824
01:54:32,330 --> 01:54:33,370
Oh my god!

2825
01:54:38,220 --> 01:54:39,960
Oh my god!

2826
01:54:43,700 --> 01:54:46,020
I didn't know you could do that.

2827
01:54:49,050 --> 01:54:50,550
Where am I?

2828
01:54:51,370 --> 01:54:52,970
Where am I?

2829
01:54:52,970 --> 01:54:53,770
Rainbow chat?

2830
01:54:58,030 --> 01:55:00,570
Please look out more often.

2831
01:55:12,380 --> 01:55:14,220
No, I came from here.

2832
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:18,500
Oh, there's...

2833
01:55:18,500 --> 01:55:19,120
Oh!

2834
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:21,760
Oh!

2835
01:55:21,760 --> 01:55:22,440
Wait.

2836
01:55:22,660 --> 01:55:23,560
Where am I?

2837
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:25,920
Wait.

2838
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:26,900
Where am I?

2839
01:55:26,900 --> 01:55:27,560
Where am I?

2840
01:55:30,920 --> 01:55:31,680
Huh?

2841
01:55:43,950 --> 01:55:44,710
I...

2842
01:55:46,790 --> 01:55:47,550
Walk?

2843
01:55:47,610 --> 01:55:48,670
No, no, no, no...

2844
01:55:48,670 --> 01:55:49,370
No?

2845
01:55:51,810 --> 01:55:52,570
Walk?

2846
01:56:01,700 --> 01:56:02,460
What?

2847
01:56:08,200 --> 01:56:09,420
I can't...

2848
01:56:10,280 --> 01:56:11,040
Wait.

2849
01:56:11,180 --> 01:56:11,680
How do I get here?

2850
01:56:11,680 --> 01:56:13,380
Wait, where the fuck is the cube?

2851
01:56:18,230 --> 01:56:18,830
Huh?

2852
01:56:21,270 --> 01:56:21,870
Cube?

2853
01:56:22,370 --> 01:56:23,410
Oh, walk.

2854
01:56:24,530 --> 01:56:25,130
Walk.

2855
01:56:25,770 --> 01:56:27,170
Wait, no, I'm back here.

2856
01:56:27,790 --> 01:56:28,390
Wait.

2857
01:56:29,570 --> 01:56:30,670
Wait, I'm back...

2858
01:56:31,350 --> 01:56:31,950
Cube?

2859
01:56:36,540 --> 01:56:37,960
Cube-kun is dead?

2860
01:56:38,500 --> 01:56:40,220
What the fuck, how do I get this?

2861
01:56:41,320 --> 01:56:41,920
What?

2862
01:56:41,920 --> 01:56:42,100
What?

2863
01:56:45,080 --> 01:56:47,960
Okay, there has to be a cube here somewhere.

2864
01:56:48,740 --> 01:56:50,060
Where is the cube?

2865
01:56:50,460 --> 01:56:51,800
Wait, wait.

2866
01:56:51,980 --> 01:56:53,940
Wait, where is the cube?

2867
01:56:54,180 --> 01:56:55,220
A box!

2868
01:56:57,900 --> 01:56:58,580
Box?

2869
01:57:01,740 --> 01:57:03,420
A walking cube.

2870
01:57:07,600 --> 01:57:08,780
I'm so confused.

2871
01:57:09,620 --> 01:57:11,660
I can't escape it.

2872
01:57:13,180 --> 01:57:14,880
I can't walk.

2873
01:57:15,340 --> 01:57:16,420
I can't walk.

2874
01:57:20,300 --> 01:57:22,820
The cube has gotten my dude.

2875
01:57:23,260 --> 01:57:25,620
Why did you guys make me burn the cube?

2876
01:57:30,420 --> 01:57:33,140
I'm like, you're allowed to hit the cube, cat girl.

2877
01:57:35,740 --> 01:57:37,800
Where the fuck is the cube?

2878
01:57:38,460 --> 01:57:39,420
Is that here?

2879
01:57:41,920 --> 01:57:42,340
Cube?

2880
01:57:46,240 --> 01:57:47,500
What the fuck?

2881
01:57:48,860 --> 01:57:49,880
Wait, where do I go?

2882
01:57:50,740 --> 01:57:52,200
Okay, okay, we do this again.

2883
01:57:53,700 --> 01:57:54,160
Okay.

2884
01:57:55,460 --> 01:57:57,440
Okay, I don't know how I fucked that up.

2885
01:57:58,860 --> 01:57:59,320
Okay.

2886
01:57:59,660 --> 01:58:00,120
Okay.

2887
01:58:00,680 --> 01:58:01,140
WHAT?!

2888
01:58:05,810 --> 01:58:06,550
What the...

2889
01:58:07,590 --> 01:58:08,970
You guys saw that?

2890
01:58:13,190 --> 01:58:15,050
I'm looking for a money cube.

2891
01:58:15,630 --> 01:58:16,490
I'm looking for a money cube.

2892
01:58:16,490 --> 01:58:16,730
I'm looking for a money cube.

2893
01:58:19,590 --> 01:58:21,610
Like, no one ever saw you look so funny.

2894
01:58:21,670 --> 01:58:22,830
Thank you, cat girl.

2895
01:58:26,130 --> 01:58:26,770
Okay.

2896
01:58:27,750 --> 01:58:28,390
Okay.

2897
01:58:30,610 --> 01:58:31,250
Cube.

2898
01:58:34,210 --> 01:58:36,330
Why is there a two here?

2899
01:58:36,950 --> 01:58:37,590
Two.

2900
01:58:38,230 --> 01:58:38,870
Three.

2901
01:58:39,970 --> 01:58:40,610
Three.

2902
01:58:42,570 --> 01:58:43,210
Cube.

2903
01:58:44,670 --> 01:58:45,310
How...

2904
01:58:45,310 --> 01:58:46,710
How did I get here?

2905
01:58:46,710 --> 01:58:47,330
I'm

2906
01:58:53,880 --> 01:58:53,880
so confused.

2907
01:58:53,880 --> 01:58:56,140
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2908
01:58:56,300 --> 01:58:57,900
Wait, what color, what color was this?

2909
01:58:59,300 --> 01:58:59,800
Oh!

2910
01:59:01,280 --> 01:59:01,780
Ah!

2911
01:59:09,720 --> 01:59:11,020
I don't need no cube!

2912
01:59:13,180 --> 01:59:14,580
I don't need no cube!

2913
01:59:15,140 --> 01:59:15,980
Wait, what's this?

2914
01:59:21,190 --> 01:59:22,990
Okay, what the fuck is this?

2915
01:59:23,610 --> 01:59:27,810
Make sure Dizzy doesn't make Doki putting her brain to the test.

2916
01:59:27,970 --> 01:59:31,110
Is she finally evolving some sproom brain-ness?

2917
01:59:31,510 --> 01:59:32,010
Hahaha.

2918
01:59:34,310 --> 01:59:34,750
Okay.

2919
01:59:35,010 --> 01:59:35,450
Okay.

2920
01:59:36,650 --> 01:59:37,090
Oh!

2921
01:59:37,230 --> 01:59:37,710
No, no, no!

2922
01:59:37,750 --> 01:59:39,890
Dude, please, please, please, cube, cube, cube, cube.

2923
01:59:40,090 --> 01:59:41,170
Cube, cube, cube, cube, cube.

2924
01:59:41,770 --> 01:59:41,810
Cube.

2925
01:59:44,290 --> 01:59:44,730
Okay.

2926
01:59:44,970 --> 01:59:45,390
Hahaha.

2927
01:59:46,510 --> 01:59:47,310
There I go.

2928
01:59:47,530 --> 01:59:49,050
Thank you so much for the follow.

2929
01:59:49,290 --> 01:59:50,130
Thank you, thank you.

2930
01:59:50,570 --> 01:59:52,470
I really do appreciate it.

2931
01:59:53,450 --> 01:59:54,550
I have a butter.

2932
01:59:54,710 --> 01:59:55,950
Thank you so much.

2933
01:59:56,150 --> 01:59:57,890
No thoughts, only cube.

2934
02:00:02,440 --> 02:00:03,460
Where does this go?

2935
02:00:08,380 --> 02:00:08,980
What?

2936
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:11,180
Wait, cube!

2937
02:00:12,620 --> 02:00:13,220
Wait.

2938
02:00:14,240 --> 02:00:15,380
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2939
02:00:16,580 --> 02:00:17,180
Okay.

2940
02:00:18,720 --> 02:00:20,160
Okay, I need cube.

2941
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:23,120
I need cube.

2942
02:00:23,500 --> 02:00:24,100
I need cube.

2943
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:24,920
And...

2944
02:00:26,820 --> 02:00:27,420
And...

2945
02:00:28,100 --> 02:00:29,180
Oh my god, wait.

2946
02:00:29,980 --> 02:00:30,580
Hahaha.

2947
02:00:31,280 --> 02:00:31,880
Wait.

2948
02:00:34,700 --> 02:00:35,940
How do you do...

2949
02:00:35,940 --> 02:00:37,300
What the fuck is this?

2950
02:00:38,860 --> 02:00:40,800
What the fuck is this?

2951
02:00:41,140 --> 02:00:41,240
What the fuck is this?

2952
02:00:44,460 --> 02:00:45,220
Okay.

2953
02:00:46,020 --> 02:00:46,780
Portal.

2954
02:00:48,380 --> 02:00:49,140
Portal.

2955
02:00:51,460 --> 02:00:55,660
I keep pressing this until I process this correctly.

2956
02:00:56,080 --> 02:00:56,220
I keep pressing this until I process this correctly.

2957
02:00:56,220 --> 02:00:57,500
Okay, so this goes...

2958
02:00:57,500 --> 02:00:58,080
Boom.

2959
02:00:58,440 --> 02:00:59,480
And then...

2960
02:00:59,480 --> 02:01:00,260
Boom.

2961
02:01:00,360 --> 02:01:00,660
Wait.

2962
02:01:04,720 --> 02:01:05,380
Wait.

2963
02:01:06,700 --> 02:01:07,460
Boom.

2964
02:01:09,600 --> 02:01:10,360
Okay.

2965
02:01:11,860 --> 02:01:12,620
Okay.

2966
02:01:12,680 --> 02:01:13,020
Okay.

2967
02:01:13,040 --> 02:01:13,340
Okay.

2968
02:01:13,380 --> 02:01:13,700
Okay.

2969
02:01:14,880 --> 02:01:15,360
Okay.

2970
02:01:15,540 --> 02:01:15,820
Okay.

2971
02:01:15,940 --> 02:01:16,140
Okay.

2972
02:01:16,140 --> 02:01:16,420
Okay.

2973
02:01:16,420 --> 02:01:16,620
Boom.

2974
02:01:17,220 --> 02:01:18,460
It goes through here.

2975
02:01:18,560 --> 02:01:18,980
Oh!

2976
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:21,000
What?

2977
02:01:21,020 --> 02:01:21,460
No, no, no.

2978
02:01:21,500 --> 02:01:22,020
Let me back.

2979
02:01:22,040 --> 02:01:22,500
Let me in.

2980
02:01:22,520 --> 02:01:23,000
Let me in.

2981
02:01:23,060 --> 02:01:23,320
Please.

2982
02:01:23,440 --> 02:01:24,180
No, no, no, no.

2983
02:01:24,280 --> 02:01:24,720
No!

2984
02:01:33,160 --> 02:01:33,640
Hahaha.

2985
02:01:33,780 --> 02:01:34,220
It...

2986
02:01:35,920 --> 02:01:36,400
Wait.

2987
02:01:40,020 --> 02:01:40,500
Wait.

2988
02:01:42,120 --> 02:01:42,860
Okay, okay.

2989
02:01:43,160 --> 02:01:43,640
Wait.

2990
02:01:44,440 --> 02:01:44,920
Wait.

2991
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:46,320
Okay.

2992
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:46,520
Okay.

2993
02:01:50,290 --> 02:01:51,250
I got this.

2994
02:01:51,390 --> 02:01:51,630
Okay.

2995
02:01:51,730 --> 02:01:52,690
I just need to keep pressing this.

2996
02:01:53,170 --> 02:01:53,610
Okay.

2997
02:01:54,110 --> 02:01:54,550
Okay.

2998
02:01:55,090 --> 02:01:56,330
And then I do this, right?

2999
02:01:57,270 --> 02:01:59,250
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3000
02:01:59,510 --> 02:02:00,130
No, no.

3001
02:02:01,290 --> 02:02:03,930
They need to stop bombing once more.

3002
02:02:04,690 --> 02:02:05,130
Hahaha.

3003
02:02:06,650 --> 02:02:08,870
I don't know what you're talking about.

3004
02:02:10,030 --> 02:02:10,750
I don't know what you're talking about.

3005
02:02:11,130 --> 02:02:11,570
Please.

3006
02:02:12,190 --> 02:02:12,630
Please.

3007
02:02:13,190 --> 02:02:13,630
Please.

3008
02:02:13,710 --> 02:02:14,670
Does it reset?

3009
02:02:14,670 --> 02:02:16,150
Does this reset?

3010
02:02:17,930 --> 02:02:19,810
Oh my god, this resets!

3011
02:02:19,970 --> 02:02:21,490
What the fuck do we do here?

3012
02:02:22,970 --> 02:02:25,720
What the fuck do we do here?

3013
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:27,920
My question is about your art.

3014
02:02:27,980 --> 02:02:29,860
You drew a lot of dogs, but you can't draw cats?

3015
02:02:30,200 --> 02:02:31,960
Yeah, I've done lots of cats before too.

3016
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:33,040
I've done lots of cats before too.

3017
02:02:33,040 --> 02:02:33,880
I've done a lot of cat emotes.

3018
02:02:33,900 --> 02:02:36,920
We just drew a lot of dogs.

3019
02:02:37,180 --> 02:02:38,520
In the past.

3020
02:02:38,780 --> 02:02:39,980
Past few commissions.

3021
02:02:40,700 --> 02:02:41,220
Also...

3022
02:02:42,840 --> 02:02:44,860
I'm trying to process this chat.

3023
02:02:45,260 --> 02:02:45,780
I...

3024
02:02:47,640 --> 02:02:49,200
I'm trying to process.

3025
02:02:50,600 --> 02:02:51,320
Raphael's cat doesn't raise a dog.

3026
02:02:51,320 --> 02:02:51,620
Where are you thinking?

3027
02:02:54,260 --> 02:02:55,340
Raphael's cat doesn't raise a dog.

3028
02:02:55,340 --> 02:02:56,260
Where are you thinking?

3029
02:02:56,620 --> 02:02:56,800
Raphael's cat isn't despite it.

3030
02:02:56,800 --> 02:02:57,440
Ah!

3031
02:02:57,580 --> 02:02:58,300
She is angry!

3032
02:03:02,660 --> 02:03:04,000
Where are you thinking?

3033
02:03:07,830 --> 02:03:08,550
I'm guilty.

3034
02:03:10,250 --> 02:03:10,970
I'm guilty.

3035
02:03:11,710 --> 02:03:12,430
Raphael's cat doesn't take any actions.

3036
02:03:14,790 --> 02:03:15,310
Okay.

3037
02:03:17,430 --> 02:03:19,470
No, no, brain think.

3038
02:03:19,850 --> 02:03:20,650
Brain think.

3039
02:03:21,330 --> 02:03:22,150
Brain think.

3040
02:03:22,550 --> 02:03:23,890
I'm just trying to... okay.

3041
02:03:26,370 --> 02:03:26,890
Okay.

3042
02:03:29,210 --> 02:03:30,250
Okay, okay.

3043
02:03:30,350 --> 02:03:30,930
Is this working?

3044
02:03:31,050 --> 02:03:31,490
Is it working?

3045
02:03:32,110 --> 02:03:32,910
Is it working?

3046
02:03:33,070 --> 02:03:33,510
Did it work?

3047
02:03:34,490 --> 02:03:35,010
What?

3048
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:47,280
How?

3049
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:03,920
Brain!

3050
02:04:10,590 --> 02:04:13,110
Brain updating to iOS 14.

3051
02:04:14,610 --> 02:04:17,590
I'm in here for five minutes and you're already on my favorite series?

3052
02:04:17,890 --> 02:04:18,530
What the fuck?

3053
02:04:18,710 --> 02:04:21,150
Your power is so entertaining.

3054
02:04:24,870 --> 02:04:25,590
Brain.

3055
02:04:25,750 --> 02:04:26,450
Brain think.

3056
02:04:27,770 --> 02:04:29,030
Brain think.

3057
02:04:32,950 --> 02:04:33,570
How?

3058
02:04:37,630 --> 02:04:38,250
Here?

3059
02:04:41,550 --> 02:04:43,930
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3060
02:04:45,370 --> 02:04:48,210
Wait, where did it go?

3061
02:04:49,530 --> 02:04:50,930
Wait, where did it go?

3062
02:04:56,980 --> 02:04:57,290
Please.

3063
02:04:57,810 --> 02:04:59,810
I don't understand.

3064
02:04:59,870 --> 02:05:00,970
There's too many things here.

3065
02:05:01,090 --> 02:05:01,250
Please.

3066
02:05:01,270 --> 02:05:03,550
There's way too many things here.

3067
02:05:04,250 --> 02:05:06,050
I can't process this.

3068
02:05:11,050 --> 02:05:11,330
Please.

3069
02:05:13,130 --> 02:05:14,330
Too many things.

3070
02:05:15,390 --> 02:05:16,490
Okay, okay, okay.

3071
02:05:17,730 --> 02:05:18,550
Okay, okay.

3072
02:05:18,750 --> 02:05:20,210
What if I destroy this?

3073
02:05:20,410 --> 02:05:20,810
Okay, okay.

3074
02:05:21,030 --> 02:05:22,090
Wait, is it destroying?

3075
02:05:22,330 --> 02:05:22,750
Is this...

3076
02:05:26,270 --> 02:05:28,190
Wait, did my game crash?

3077
02:05:28,190 --> 02:05:29,150
Oh, God.

3078
02:05:34,510 --> 02:05:35,630
Brain did it.

3079
02:05:36,830 --> 02:05:37,950
Brain did it.

3080
02:05:38,750 --> 02:05:39,590
I did it.

3081
02:05:42,750 --> 02:05:44,070
I was so scared.

3082
02:05:44,110 --> 02:05:44,870
My game crashed.

3083
02:05:45,850 --> 02:05:46,950
Okay, okay, okay.

3084
02:05:47,810 --> 02:05:48,290
Okay.

3085
02:05:48,650 --> 02:05:49,030
Okay.

3086
02:05:53,880 --> 02:05:54,360
Wait.

3087
02:05:55,600 --> 02:05:56,080
Wait.

3088
02:05:57,040 --> 02:05:57,860
Brain did it?

3089
02:05:58,500 --> 02:05:59,300
Brain did it?

3090
02:05:59,300 --> 02:05:59,400
Okay?

3091
02:06:00,740 --> 02:06:01,220
Oh.

3092
02:06:01,900 --> 02:06:03,220
Wait wait wait wait wait wait.

3093
02:06:03,340 --> 02:06:03,620
I understand.

3094
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:04,180
I understand.

3095
02:06:04,540 --> 02:06:05,700
Brain, I understand.

3096
02:06:05,820 --> 02:06:06,820
I understand now chat.

3097
02:06:07,280 --> 02:06:08,380
I understand it.

3098
02:06:08,480 --> 02:06:08,760
Okay.

3099
02:06:08,860 --> 02:06:09,840
I need to kill this.

3100
02:06:10,820 --> 02:06:12,700
I need to kill this so...

3101
02:06:13,320 --> 02:06:14,260
So this...

3102
02:06:15,660 --> 02:06:17,200
This needs to hit...

3103
02:06:17,720 --> 02:06:19,320
This needs to hit this right?

3104
02:06:19,880 --> 02:06:20,360
No!

3105
02:06:20,420 --> 02:06:20,680
No!

3106
02:06:20,700 --> 02:06:21,020
Please!

3107
02:06:21,160 --> 02:06:21,780
Please please please.

3108
02:06:22,060 --> 02:06:22,480
Oh!

3109
02:06:22,580 --> 02:06:22,960
Please!

3110
02:06:23,120 --> 02:06:23,500
Please!

3111
02:06:27,580 --> 02:06:28,900
Wait wait wait wait.

3112
02:06:28,900 --> 02:06:29,120
Wait, wait, wait.

3113
02:06:29,160 --> 02:06:29,920
Brain did it!

3114
02:06:29,980 --> 02:06:30,560
Brain did it!

3115
02:06:36,100 --> 02:06:36,540
Brain did it!

3116
02:06:41,300 --> 02:06:42,480
Brain did it!

3117
02:06:43,480 --> 02:06:45,440
Brain... oh wait, how do I kill this?

3118
02:06:46,100 --> 02:06:48,380
Wait, how do I... how do brain kill this?

3119
02:06:50,060 --> 02:06:51,740
There is a good jump.

3120
02:06:52,520 --> 02:06:55,340
Brain going over, I tried to control both of the portals.

3121
02:06:55,420 --> 02:06:57,660
But we added cubes to the mix.

3122
02:06:57,660 --> 02:06:58,660
Okay, wait.

3123
02:06:59,140 --> 02:07:00,420
Chat, chat chat chat chat.

3124
02:07:01,720 --> 02:07:03,280
Chat chat chat, brain is going to do it.

3125
02:07:04,300 --> 02:07:05,440
No, no no no no.

3126
02:07:05,520 --> 02:07:06,840
No no no no no no no.

3127
02:07:07,160 --> 02:07:08,140
Wait, how do I kill this?

3128
02:07:09,440 --> 02:07:09,800
Wait.

3129
02:07:12,240 --> 02:07:12,600
Here?

3130
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:15,960
Where the fuck is that?

3131
02:07:18,700 --> 02:07:20,080
Okay, where are you pointing at?

3132
02:07:22,280 --> 02:07:23,000
Where... oh!

3133
02:07:23,180 --> 02:07:24,100
Oh brain... oh.

3134
02:07:32,760 --> 02:07:33,920
Brain did it.

3135
02:07:34,360 --> 02:07:34,980
Brain did it.

3136
02:07:36,440 --> 02:07:38,200
God, I'm so fucking smart.

3137
02:07:38,540 --> 02:07:40,120
It only took me one minute, chat.

3138
02:07:40,400 --> 02:07:41,500
I figured it out.

3139
02:07:41,600 --> 02:07:43,300
And all it took was one minute.

3140
02:07:44,100 --> 02:07:44,980
One minute.

3141
02:07:45,220 --> 02:07:46,980
Look at that, it's like a speed run.

3142
02:07:50,400 --> 02:07:51,780
It's like a speed run.

3143
02:07:53,540 --> 02:07:55,020
Okay, okay, look at that.

3144
02:08:06,210 --> 02:08:08,770
You can't refer to your own brain as a third person.

3145
02:08:08,770 --> 02:08:08,830
You can't refer to your own brain as a third person.

3146
02:08:08,850 --> 02:08:10,150
This is alarming.

3147
02:08:10,490 --> 02:08:12,210
At your game manager.

3148
02:08:12,430 --> 02:08:16,570
Okay, if I like... do I have to like keep clicking this or will it never...

3149
02:08:16,570 --> 02:08:17,710
will it like...

3150
02:08:18,110 --> 02:08:19,910
Okay, now I need to destroy... okay.

3151
02:08:19,990 --> 02:08:22,310
I need to keep clicking this or...

3152
02:08:22,870 --> 02:08:23,270
Okay.

3153
02:08:24,910 --> 02:08:25,310
Oh

3154
02:08:28,980 --> 02:08:30,340
my god, let me back in, let me back in.

3155
02:08:30,400 --> 02:08:30,940
I'm so scared.

3156
02:08:31,500 --> 02:08:33,080
Okay, I did it.

3157
02:08:34,820 --> 02:08:35,600
Oh my gosh.

3158
02:08:35,760 --> 02:08:36,620
No, no.

3159
02:08:37,060 --> 02:08:37,800
How do I...

3160
02:08:38,320 --> 02:08:38,720
Okay.

3161
02:08:40,060 --> 02:08:42,460
Do I need to like forever click this?

3162
02:08:42,720 --> 02:08:43,860
Or am I gonna be stuck?

3163
02:08:44,860 --> 02:08:46,020
I'm not braindead.

3164
02:08:46,900 --> 02:08:48,600
Do I need to always click this?

3165
02:08:48,680 --> 02:08:50,320
Or will I be stuck forever?

3166
02:08:51,880 --> 02:08:54,120
Will I be stuck forever if I don't click it?

3167
02:08:54,560 --> 02:08:56,860
Phone dying at 3% Alright, Siri.

3168
02:08:57,840 --> 02:09:01,180
Siri's taking five of us and watching my read.

3169
02:09:01,540 --> 02:09:02,180
Siri's taking five of us and watching my read.

3170
02:09:02,320 --> 02:09:03,360
Thank you so much.

3171
02:09:03,640 --> 02:09:04,500
I hope you...

3172
02:09:04,500 --> 02:09:07,160
God, I hope you have a good rest of the day.

3173
02:09:07,380 --> 02:09:08,500
This is what Twitter's like.

3174
02:09:08,720 --> 02:09:10,740
Getting lost in holes the moment you jump in.

3175
02:09:12,520 --> 02:09:14,960
It's a real porous cat me on my way to the stairs so we pay one.

3176
02:09:15,240 --> 02:09:17,020
It will inform it when it deletes.

3177
02:09:17,180 --> 02:09:17,420
Okay.

3178
02:09:18,380 --> 02:09:19,880
Alright, am I gonna be stuck here forever?

3179
02:09:22,820 --> 02:09:23,600
Am I gonna be...

3180
02:09:24,240 --> 02:09:24,640
Okay.

3181
02:09:27,520 --> 02:09:27,920
Okay.

3182
02:09:28,940 --> 02:09:29,700
Brain thinking.

3183
02:09:30,800 --> 02:09:31,480
Brain think.

3184
02:09:34,240 --> 02:09:36,320
Oh, am I gonna be... Did I fuck up?

3185
02:09:37,580 --> 02:09:38,340
Wait, did I...

3186
02:09:38,720 --> 02:09:39,460
Did I fuck up?

3187
02:09:41,120 --> 02:09:41,920
Oh, no, no, no.

3188
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:43,300
No, no, no, I did not fuck up.

3189
02:09:43,360 --> 02:09:44,060
It's here, it's here.

3190
02:09:44,640 --> 02:09:45,240
Brain here.

3191
02:09:46,200 --> 02:09:46,600
Okay.

Okay.

3194
02:09:55,160 --> 02:09:56,020
What's over here?

3195
02:09:57,680 --> 02:09:58,420
Okay, nothing.

3196
02:09:59,840 --> 02:10:00,240
Okay.

3197
02:10:03,220 --> 02:10:04,160
Okay, brain think.

3198
02:10:04,900 --> 02:10:06,020
Wait, did I fuck up?

3199
02:10:06,680 --> 02:10:08,800
Chat, did I... How do I get back inside?

3200
02:10:09,700 --> 02:10:10,100
Wait.

3201
02:10:10,380 --> 02:10:10,900
Do I...

3202
02:10:11,340 --> 02:10:11,760
Wait.

3203
02:10:12,720 --> 02:10:13,920
Chat, did I fuck up?

3204
02:10:15,940 --> 02:10:17,220
Am I supposed to...

3205
02:10:17,220 --> 02:10:18,840
Am I supposed to...

3206
02:10:18,840 --> 02:10:20,500
not have it closed?

3207
02:10:23,200 --> 02:10:24,100
I don't know.

3208
02:10:25,080 --> 02:10:26,160
Oh, no, no, I didn't.

3209
02:10:26,420 --> 02:10:27,100
No, no, no.

3210
02:10:27,820 --> 02:10:30,380
No, I didn't fuck up.

3211
02:10:30,420 --> 02:10:30,600
No.

3212
02:10:31,220 --> 02:10:32,040
No, no, no, no.

3213
02:10:34,080 --> 02:10:34,960
No, no, no, no.

02:10:59,180 --> 02:10:59,640
Brain.

3218
02:11:01,280 --> 02:11:01,740
Okay.

3219
02:11:01,740 --> 02:11:02,200
Brain.

3220
02:11:04,980 --> 02:11:05,440
Brain?

3221
02:11:06,360 --> 02:11:06,820
Brain!

3222
02:11:16,960 --> 02:11:17,420
Okay.

3223
02:11:17,860 --> 02:11:19,140
Okay, I think I fucked up.

3224
02:11:19,340 --> 02:11:21,180
I think this needs to...

3225
02:11:22,340 --> 02:11:23,380
Brain no work.

3226
02:11:23,820 --> 02:11:24,280
Okay.

3227
02:11:24,680 --> 02:11:25,840
I got it, I got it.

3228
02:11:25,920 --> 02:11:26,960
I know, I know what to do.

3229
02:11:27,440 --> 02:11:28,040
I know.

3230
02:11:32,190 --> 02:11:33,750
I used the wrong portal.

3231
02:11:36,830 --> 02:11:38,830
I used the wrong one.

3232
02:11:41,830 --> 02:11:42,930
Brain sad.

3233
02:11:44,330 --> 02:11:45,610
Brain sad.

3234
02:11:46,410 --> 02:11:47,050
Brain sad.

3235
02:11:48,030 --> 02:11:50,230
I think I need to die again.

3236
02:11:50,530 --> 02:11:50,770
I think I need to die again.

3237
02:11:50,770 --> 02:11:51,010
Right?

3238
02:11:51,610 --> 02:11:52,570
I don't know.

3239
02:12:00,630 --> 02:12:02,930
I just love getting really...

3240
02:12:02,930 --> 02:12:04,090
I'm doing the purple.

3241
02:12:04,770 --> 02:12:05,990

Okay, wait, wait.

02:12:09,590 --> 02:12:10,770
Okay, okay, okay.

3245
02:12:11,300 --> 02:12:12,010
I'm sorry.

3246
02:12:14,730 --> 02:12:15,430
Okay.

3247
02:12:15,550 --> 02:12:16,030

Brain.

3251
02:12:22,030 --> 02:12:22,730
Brain.

3252
02:12:24,190 --> 02:12:25,270
Brain did it.

3253
02:12:26,910 --> 02:12:27,970
Yeah, you guys.

3254
02:12:28,370 --> 02:12:29,410
First try.

3255
02:12:29,890 --> 02:12:31,650
First fucking try.

3256
02:12:32,010 --> 02:12:32,950

3258
02:12:50,750 --> 02:12:51,450
No.

3259
02:13:03,800 --> 02:13:05,440
Oh my god.

3260
02:13:07,520 --> 02:13:08,420
Are you...

3261
02:13:08,420 --> 02:13:09,100

3263
02:13:13,130 --> 02:13:13,690
Okay.

There we go.

3268
02:13:20,110 --> 02:13:20,670
There.

3269
02:13:22,570 --> 02:13:24,990
You're keeping me up at four in the morning.

3270
02:13:27,250 --> 02:13:28,250
There we go.

3271
02:13:28,790 --> 02:13:29,350
Okay.

3272
02:13:34,310 --> 02:13:34,870

02:13:36,470 --> 02:13:37,110
Cube.

3276
02:13:37,470 --> 02:13:39,150
We got our cube back.

3277
02:13:39,790 --> 02:13:40,430
Okay.

3278
02:13:40,510 --> 02:13:42,270

02:13:43,130 --> 02:13:45,130
I'm gonna jump over here.

3280
02:13:45,850 --> 02:13:46,490
I'm gonna jump over here.

3281
02:13:46,490 --> 02:13:47,170
Wait, how do I press that?

3282
02:13:53,780 --> 02:13:54,100
Portal.

3283
02:13:56,040 --> 02:13:56,680
Huh?

3284
02:13:57,760 --> 02:13:58,080
Oh.

3285
02:14:05,210 --> 02:14:05,850
Portal.

3286
02:14:08,910 --> 02:14:09,550
Bam.

3287
02:14:09,550 --> 02:14:10,190
Look at that.

3288
02:14:10,230 --> 02:14:11,270
First fucking try.

3289
02:14:11,470 --> 02:14:11,690
What?

3290
02:14:11,930 --> 02:14:12,570
Oh.

3291
02:14:15,880 --> 02:14:17,760
First fucking try.

3292
02:14:19,080 --> 02:14:19,840
Huh?

3293
02:14:21,700 --> 02:14:22,460
Huh?

3294
02:14:22,760 --> 02:14:23,360
Oh.

3295
02:14:27,900 --> 02:14:29,160
The brain's...

3296
02:14:29,160 --> 02:14:30,200
Okay, okay.

3297
02:14:31,440 --> 02:14:33,740
Is your brain on me?

3298
02:14:33,840 --> 02:14:34,100
Is your brain on me?

3299
02:14:34,540 --> 02:14:36,420
It's not over till it's over.

3300
02:14:37,200 --> 02:14:38,680
What the fuck is this?

3301
02:14:56,500 --> 02:14:56,880
Portal.

3302
02:15:01,340 --> 02:15:01,940
Oh.

3303
02:15:02,080 --> 02:15:02,340
No.

3304
02:15:07,600 --> 02:15:08,200
Okay.

3305
02:15:08,540 --> 02:15:10,160
That was not the right portal.

3306
02:15:12,120 --> 02:15:12,720
Portal.

3307
02:15:16,660 --> 02:15:17,260
Portal.

3308
02:15:18,320 --> 02:15:19,320
I'm so wide awake.

3309
02:15:19,400 --> 02:15:21,500
After just five minutes of joining in.

3310
02:15:23,180 --> 02:15:25,360
I'm having a stroke after that one.

3311
02:15:25,560 --> 02:15:25,940
I'm having a stroke after that one.

3312
02:15:25,940 --> 02:15:26,000
Okay.

3313
02:15:26,240 --> 02:15:26,840
Look.

3314
02:15:27,320 --> 02:15:28,900
Oh, portal.

3315
02:15:29,020 --> 02:15:30,040
This one.

3316
02:15:31,700 --> 02:15:33,680
And then it's like, oh shit, I don't know why this...

3317
02:15:33,680 --> 02:15:34,800
I'm just playing sad.

3318
02:15:36,800 --> 02:15:37,420
Not sad.

3319
02:15:44,030 --> 02:15:45,110
I think I fucked up.

3320
02:15:49,470 --> 02:15:50,490
I fucked it up.

3321
02:15:50,630 --> 02:15:50,870
I fucked it up.

3322
02:15:51,010 --> 02:15:52,070
Wait, how do I get out of here?

3323
02:15:52,650 --> 02:15:54,210
Wait, how do I get out of here?

3324
02:15:54,570 --> 02:15:55,310
Oh, here, here, here.

02:16:24,880 --> 02:16:25,700
Oh, shit.

02:16:26,060 --> 02:16:26,720
Oh my god.

All I'm saying is portal.

Hey.

3382
02:18:01,450 --> 02:18:02,610
Oh...

3383
02:18:02,610 --> 02:18:03,390
portal is trying.

3384
02:18:03,970 --> 02:18:07,810
All right, hold on.

3385
02:18:07,810 --> 02:18:08,510
They're strong.

3386
02:18:10,890 --> 02:18:13,950
Okay, I just remember not to use right click.

3387
02:18:16,590 --> 02:18:17,270
Portal.

3388
02:18:21,570 --> 02:18:22,250
Portal.

3389
02:18:22,250 --> 02:18:23,090
Portal no.

3390
02:18:23,290 --> 02:18:24,110
Portal no.

3391
02:18:26,610 --> 02:18:27,290
Okay.

3392
02:18:29,450 --> 02:18:31,050
Okay, I just... okay.

3393
02:18:31,250 --> 02:18:34,490
Don't use... do not use left click.

3394
02:18:34,890 --> 02:18:36,850
Do not use left click.

3395
02:18:39,070 --> 02:18:39,590
Portal.

3396
02:18:39,890 --> 02:18:40,830
Portal to get it strong.

3397
02:18:41,250 --> 02:18:43,070
Who is the portal that you need on your way out?

3398
02:18:43,250 --> 02:18:43,730
Portal.

3399
02:18:43,850 --> 02:18:44,890
No, portal stay.

3400
02:18:46,770 --> 02:18:47,290
Portal.

3401
02:18:49,190 --> 02:18:50,090
Ah-ha.

3402
02:18:55,870 --> 02:18:58,430
No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3403
02:19:01,830 --> 02:19:04,610
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

02:19:05,690 --> 02:19:06,670
Don't use blue.

3405
02:19:06,850 --> 02:19:07,870
Don't use blue.

3406
02:19:08,150 --> 02:19:09,350
I know my colors.

3407
02:19:10,890 --> 02:19:12,090
Don't use blue.

3408
02:19:12,250 --> 02:19:13,330
Don't use blue.

3409
02:19:13,850 --> 02:19:14,510
Yeah!

3410
02:19:15,490 --> 02:19:16,150
Yeah!

3411
02:19:16,590 --> 02:19:17,350
Oh, well.

Look at that!

3413
02:19:19,290 --> 02:19:21,390
Look, she said well done!

3414
02:19:21,950 --> 02:19:23,550
She said well done.

3415
02:19:24,510 --> 02:19:26,210
The last sister got that.

3416
02:19:28,850 --> 02:19:31,990
Look, Kato thinks I did great!

3417
02:19:32,230 --> 02:19:33,330
I did amazing!

3418
02:19:34,230 --> 02:19:35,850
I got an A+.

3419
02:19:37,130 --> 02:19:38,430
I'm glad I was.

3420
02:19:43,170 --> 02:19:44,050
I'm glad I was.

3421
02:19:44,050 --> 02:19:44,330
Portal strong.

3422
02:19:47,950 --> 02:19:49,270
Bunga bunga.

3423

Portal round.

3424
02:19:51,870 --> 02:19:54,170
Welcome to the final test.

3425
02:19:54,310 --> 02:19:55,010
Oh my god.

3426
02:19:55,010 --> 02:19:56,270
Final test.

3427
02:19:56,710 --> 02:19:57,570
Portal good.

3428
02:19:58,970 --> 02:19:59,850
Okay.

3429
02:19:59,850 --> 02:20:00,730
Okay.

3430
02:20:00,870 --> 02:20:05,510
The management center regulations require both hands to be empty before any...

3431
02:20:05,510 --> 02:20:05,890
Hit.

3432
02:20:06,470 --> 02:20:07,350

02:20:09,250 --> 02:20:09,830
Bad.

3435
02:20:10,930 --> 02:20:11,830
Wash hands.

3436
02:20:12,050 --> 02:20:12,410
Cake.

3437
02:20:12,870 --> 02:20:13,570
Okay.

3438
02:20:13,750 --> 02:20:14,470
Okay.

3439
02:20:14,650 --> 02:20:16,310
So... Hit.

3440
02:20:17,030 --> 02:20:17,770

3442
02:20:19,210 --> 02:20:19,950
Okay.

3443
02:20:20,290 --> 02:20:20,970
Okay.

3444
02:20:21,190 --> 02:20:22,510
Okay, this is bad.

3445
02:20:23,330 --> 02:20:24,070
Hit.

3446
02:20:24,760 --> 02:20:25,130
Wait.

3447
02:20:25,250 --> 02:20:25,830
Hit fall?

3448
02:20:26,030 --> 02:20:26,790
Hit fall.

3449
02:20:27,670 --> 02:20:28,410
Okay.

3450
02:20:28,870 --> 02:20:30,550
We're hit though.

3451
02:20:30,930 --> 02:20:31,950
We're hit.

3452
02:20:32,850 --> 02:20:33,590
Here?

3453
02:20:34,580 --> 02:20:35,450
Where does this go?

3454
02:20:37,590 --> 02:20:38,790
Hit.

3455
02:20:39,170 --> 02:20:39,770
What?

3456
02:20:41,170 --> 02:20:42,370
Wait.

02:20:42,950 --> 02:20:44,710
Where this go?

3458
02:20:45,690 --> 02:20:47,170
Oh, here!

3459
02:20:47,610 --> 02:20:48,290
Okay.

3460
02:20:49,370 --> 02:20:50,570
Okay.

3461
02:20:51,230 --> 02:20:51,830
Hit.

3462
02:20:53,230 --> 02:20:54,430
Hit.

3463
02:20:56,390 --> 02:20:57,590
Hit.

3464
02:20:59,070 --> 02:20:59,670
Hit.

3465
02:21:10,450 --> 02:21:11,050
Wait.

3466
02:21:11,050 --> 02:21:11,850
Wait.

3467
02:21:11,850 --> 02:21:12,250
Wait.

3468
02:21:12,350 --> 02:21:12,730
It moved?

3469
02:21:13,090 --> 02:21:15,170
How did I get this to move?

3470
02:21:15,710 --> 02:21:16,350
Wait.

3471
02:21:17,850 --> 02:21:19,130
I somehow...

3472
02:21:19,130 --> 02:21:22,310
I don't even know how I got this one right.

3473
02:21:23,490 --> 02:21:24,130
Wait.

3474
02:21:25,730 --> 02:21:27,670
How did I activate this?

3475
02:21:29,530 --> 02:21:30,410
Oh, I...

3476
02:21:30,410 --> 02:21:31,730
Wait, I activated it.

3477
02:21:31,970 --> 02:21:32,590
Wait, how?

3478
02:21:37,870 --> 02:21:40,130
I didn't even activate this.

3479
02:21:40,590 --> 02:21:41,230
Wait.

3480
02:21:44,350 --> 02:21:47,010
Okay, I... I... I honestly don't know how I did that.

3481
02:21:47,190 --> 02:21:48,570
I... I...

3482
02:21:48,570 --> 02:21:50,230
I don't know how that worked.

3483
02:21:50,630 --> 02:21:52,830
I have the biggest brain.

3484
02:21:54,050 --> 02:22:02,430
I have the biggest brain.

3485
02:22:02,430 --> 02:22:03,150
I don't know how I did it.

3486
02:22:04,050 --> 02:22:06,790
So I just saw it unconsciously.

3487
02:22:09,970 --> 02:22:11,210
Alright, where's the...

3488
02:22:11,790 --> 02:22:12,450
Where's the thing?

3489
02:22:12,690 --> 02:22:14,950
I thought I saw your big brain there, but shit.

3490
02:22:15,030 --> 02:22:15,450
What?

3491
02:22:18,610 --> 02:22:19,130
Okay.

3492
02:22:25,140 --> 02:22:25,660
Brain.

3493
02:22:29,230 --> 02:22:29,750
Okay.

3494
02:22:37,140 --> 02:22:37,660
Please.

3495
02:22:39,540 --> 02:22:40,060
Oh.

3496
02:22:40,100 --> 02:22:40,520
Oh!

3497
02:22:40,580 --> 02:22:41,460

3498
02:22:41,720 --> 02:22:42,280
Brain, brain!

3499
02:22:45,980 --> 02:22:46,880
Brain, big!

3500
02:22:48,720 --> 02:22:49,360
Oh.

3501
02:22:53,600 --> 02:22:54,240
Oh.

3502
02:22:54,480 --> 02:22:54,840
Brain!

3503
02:23:04,060 --> 02:23:04,700
Okay.

3504
02:23:08,960 --> 02:23:09,600
Okay.

3505
02:23:09,600 --> 02:23:09,680
Okay.

02:23:09,760 --> 02:23:11,140
Okay, brain mainly not big.

3508
02:23:12,760 --> 02:23:14,760
I'm loving you guys so much, I've been laughing.

3509
02:23:15,060 --> 02:23:15,280
I'm loving you guys so much, I've been laughing.

3510
02:23:15,580 --> 02:23:17,240
Brain too big.

3511
02:23:17,340 --> 02:23:18,060
Brain gone.

3512
02:23:18,740 --> 02:23:19,820
Brain gone.

3513
02:23:21,520 --> 02:23:22,640
No, no, no, not again!

3514
02:23:22,740 --> 02:23:22,980
No!

3515
02:23:23,320 --> 02:23:23,800
Okay.

3516
02:23:29,520 --> 02:23:31,880
Sorry, I... I got jump scared by...

3517
02:23:32,460 --> 02:23:33,520
by the thing.

3518
02:23:37,020 --> 02:23:37,500
Great.

3519
02:23:37,640 --> 02:23:38,480
What do I do here?

3520
02:23:38,820 --> 02:23:39,760
What do I do?

3521
02:23:42,260 --> 02:23:42,740
Brain?

3522
02:23:44,620 --> 02:23:45,100
Brain?

3523
02:23:45,860 --> 02:23:46,720
Wait, what's this?

3524
02:23:48,020 --> 02:23:48,700
Wait, what?

3525
02:23:49,740 --> 02:23:50,640
Where am I?

3526
02:23:52,260 --> 02:23:54,200
At least you touched it.

3527
02:23:54,480 --> 02:23:54,960
Brain.

3528
02:23:55,180 --> 02:23:55,780
Here it is.

3529
02:23:55,860 --> 02:23:56,540
Wait.

3530
02:23:57,020 --> 02:23:57,700
What?

3531
02:24:01,610 --> 02:24:02,510
Oh, what?

3532
02:24:05,050 --> 02:24:05,730
What?

3533
02:24:09,930 --> 02:24:10,610
What?

3534
02:24:11,250 --> 02:24:11,930
What?

3535
02:24:13,830 --> 02:24:15,310
I'm so confused.

3536
02:24:15,810 --> 02:24:15,950
I'm so confused.

3537
02:24:17,630 --> 02:24:20,150
I just keep going back to this thing.

3538
02:24:20,750 --> 02:24:20,750
I

3539
02:24:26,540 --> 02:24:29,220
just keep going back to this thing.

3540
02:24:29,220 --> 02:24:29,280
Brain?

3541
02:24:35,630 --> 02:24:36,310
Brain?

3542
02:24:36,350 --> 02:24:36,830
Brain?

3543
02:24:36,910 --> 02:24:37,030
Brain!

3544
02:24:37,470 --> 02:24:37,830
Brain!

3545
02:24:38,030 --> 02:24:38,610
Brain!

3546
02:24:39,610 --> 02:24:40,150
Brain?

3547
02:24:41,070 --> 02:24:41,530
Congratulations.

3548
02:24:42,610 --> 02:24:44,050
The test is now over.

3549
02:24:44,270 --> 02:24:48,310
All Aperture technologies remain safely optically optional.

3550
02:24:48,570 --> 02:24:49,790
Up to 4,000 degrees.

3551
02:24:50,370 --> 02:24:53,950
Best assured that there is absolute I die?

3552
02:24:54,970 --> 02:24:56,310
I die?

3553
02:24:56,710 --> 02:24:57,330
I die?

3554
02:24:58,530 --> 02:25:03,890
Thank you for participating in this Aperture Science computer-aided enrichment activity.

3555
02:25:04,590 --> 02:25:07,070
Thank you for participating in this Aperture Science computer-aided enrichment activity.

3556
02:25:07,070 --> 02:25:08,390
What?

3557
02:25:08,750 --> 02:25:09,710
What?

3558
02:25:14,590 --> 02:25:15,550
Oh...

3559
02:25:17,190 --> 02:25:18,710
Oh, wait.

3560
02:25:23,550 --> 02:25:24,510
Okay.

3561
02:25:24,650 --> 02:25:26,410
To be fair...

3562
02:25:26,410 --> 02:25:28,070
I...

3563
02:25:28,630 --> 02:25:29,710
Oh,

3564
02:25:37,220 --> 02:25:37,600
fuck!

3565
02:25:38,360 --> 02:25:38,840
Oh, dude.

3566
02:25:39,320 --> 02:25:43,520
I don't understand.

3567
02:25:45,980 --> 02:25:47,120
Where is it?

3568
02:25:47,120 --> 02:25:48,900
Where is the exit?

3569
02:25:49,080 --> 02:25:49,480
Oh!

3570
02:25:50,440 --> 02:25:51,720
It's right here.

3571
02:25:58,160 --> 02:25:59,180
It's right here.

3572
02:26:04,060 --> 02:26:07,340
I thought the exit was all the way back there.

3573
02:26:07,720 --> 02:26:08,840
That was police.

3574
02:26:09,640 --> 02:26:11,120
Alright, get me out of here.

3575
02:26:11,580 --> 02:26:12,940
Get me out of here.

3576
02:26:13,520 --> 02:26:15,000
Get me out of here.

3577
02:26:20,220 --> 02:26:20,500
Haha.

3578
02:26:23,060 --> 02:26:24,360
Look at that.

3579
02:26:24,960 --> 02:26:25,860
Green Big.

3580
02:26:28,820 --> 02:26:30,380
Please, let me out.

3581
02:26:31,400 --> 02:26:32,280
Look at that.

3582
02:26:32,320 --> 02:26:32,780
See?

3583
02:26:32,940 --> 02:26:33,320
Look at that!

3584
02:26:33,480 --> 02:26:35,060
This game only took me...

3585
02:26:35,060 --> 02:26:37,400
It only took me 30 minutes, chat.

3586
02:26:38,840 --> 02:26:40,720
Only took me 30 minutes.

3587
02:26:41,100 --> 02:26:41,620
I...

3588
02:26:42,620 --> 02:26:43,980
Oh my god, dude.

3589
02:26:44,160 --> 02:26:46,380
Thank you so much for the 100 bits.

3590
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:47,880
Thank you.

3591
02:26:47,880 --> 02:26:48,380
Thank you.

3592
02:26:48,380 --> 02:26:50,240
I really do appreciate it.

3593
02:26:50,260 --> 02:26:51,380
Portal no.

3594
02:26:51,600 --> 02:26:52,580
Portal bad.

3595
02:26:53,140 --> 02:26:54,960
Open the door!

3596
02:26:56,160 --> 02:26:57,300
Wait.

3597
02:26:58,460 --> 02:26:59,600
Wait.

3598
02:27:00,780 --> 02:27:01,920
Up?

3599
02:27:04,400 --> 02:27:05,540
Up?

3600
02:27:05,900 --> 02:27:07,040
No.

3601
02:27:08,260 --> 02:27:09,400
Up?

3602
02:27:36,510 --> 02:27:37,490
He's cheating.

3603
02:27:39,590 --> 02:27:40,130
Wait.

3604
02:27:40,470 --> 02:27:41,010
Huh?

3605
02:27:43,150 --> 02:27:43,690
Yeah.

3606
02:27:49,880 --> 02:27:53,000
I was learning about the zero in the last 30 minutes.

3607
02:27:53,620 --> 02:27:54,160
Look.

3608
02:27:54,300 --> 02:27:55,840
It helps me think, okay?

3609
02:27:56,360 --> 02:27:57,900
Less words helps me think.

3610
02:27:57,940 --> 02:27:59,980
This game is too big for me even to watch.

3611
02:28:00,380 --> 02:28:01,540
Apex 2.

3612
02:28:02,480 --> 02:28:03,020
Okay.

3613
02:28:03,300 --> 02:28:04,360
No, no, no, no.

3614
02:28:05,080 --> 02:28:05,720
I'm a caveman.

3615
02:28:18,460 --> 02:28:19,600
Yeah, that's right.

3616
02:28:20,900 --> 02:28:22,460
She's evolving just backwards.

3617
02:28:28,800 --> 02:28:29,520
Which way?

3618
02:28:29,580 --> 02:28:30,320
Left or right?

3619
02:28:30,440 --> 02:28:31,200
Does it matter?

3620
02:28:31,520 --> 02:28:33,500
Does it matter which way I go, chat?

3621
02:28:35,260 --> 02:28:37,700
Left, ooga booga, streamer, or right?

3622
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:39,480
Wait.

3623
02:28:39,480 --> 02:28:40,240
All three?

3624
02:28:41,160 --> 02:28:41,640
Okay.

3625
02:28:41,640 --> 02:28:42,120
Okay.

3626
02:28:43,180 --> 02:28:43,640
Okay.

3627
02:28:43,700 --> 02:28:44,460
It doesn't matter.

3628
02:28:44,800 --> 02:28:46,780
She's still moving faster.

3629
02:28:48,760 --> 02:28:49,220
Oh.

3630
02:28:49,220 --> 02:28:51,730
Look at that.

3631
02:28:51,930 --> 02:28:52,550
Look at that!

3632
02:28:53,750 --> 02:28:55,670
Un-g- Oh.

3633
02:28:56,930 --> 02:28:58,330
I just moved.

3634
02:29:01,130 --> 02:29:01,590
Okay.

3635
02:29:01,670 --> 02:29:02,470
Where did I come from?

3636
02:29:02,570 --> 02:29:02,790
Okay.

3637
02:29:02,830 --> 02:29:03,430
I came from here.

3638
02:29:04,490 --> 02:29:04,950
Okay.

3639
02:29:04,950 --> 02:29:05,410
Okay.

3640
02:29:05,430 --> 02:29:05,810
I go in.

3641
02:29:06,090 --> 02:29:07,590
How goes the portals?

3642
02:29:07,590 --> 02:29:08,530
We're almost atlas.

3643
02:29:08,910 --> 02:29:10,090
We're advancing.

3644
02:29:10,090 --> 02:29:10,330
I'm advancing.

3645
02:29:10,390 --> 02:29:14,050
Imagine Doki playing as a desire.

3646
02:29:15,850 --> 02:29:16,810
Okay.

3647
02:29:20,010 --> 02:29:20,970
No.

3648
02:29:25,350 --> 02:29:26,310
No.

3649
02:29:26,830 --> 02:29:27,790
Wait.

3650
02:29:27,930 --> 02:29:28,270
Where?

3651
02:29:30,730 --> 02:29:31,690
Here?

3652
02:29:35,090 --> 02:29:36,050
No.

3653
02:29:36,590 --> 02:29:37,550
Here.

3654
02:29:37,690 --> 02:29:38,870
No, no, no.

3655
02:29:40,630 --> 02:29:41,590
He...

3656
02:29:41,590 --> 02:29:42,430
Oh.

3657
02:29:42,970 --> 02:29:43,570
Up?

3658
02:29:43,910 --> 02:29:44,250
Up.

3659
02:29:44,890 --> 02:29:45,490
Up.

3660
02:29:46,130 --> 02:29:46,730
Up.

3661
02:29:49,830 --> 02:29:50,430
Wait.

3662
02:29:50,630 --> 02:29:51,890
This stream is looking good though.

3663
02:29:51,890 --> 02:29:53,970
This stream is gonna be pure go- Wait.

3664
02:29:54,110 --> 02:29:54,350
No.

3665
02:29:56,410 --> 02:29:57,010
Down.

3666
02:30:03,690 --> 02:30:04,290
Wait.

3667
02:30:04,510 --> 02:30:04,970
Wait.

3668
02:30:05,310 --> 02:30:05,910
Wait.

3669
02:30:07,090 --> 02:30:08,010
Where am I?

3670
02:30:08,710 --> 02:30:10,430
I- I was going up!

3671
02:30:10,650 --> 02:30:12,950
I was going over in time!

3672
02:30:14,250 --> 02:30:15,210
Up?

3673
02:30:24,080 --> 02:30:25,040
Up?

3674
02:30:26,440 --> 02:30:27,840
Where am I?

3675
02:30:28,920 --> 02:30:29,800
Wait.

3676
02:30:29,820 --> 02:30:29,900
Oh.

3677
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:30,980
I gotta go up.

3678
02:30:31,620 --> 02:30:34,100
He cooked right- Down.

3679
02:30:34,500 --> 02:30:35,300
Oh.

3680
02:30:35,360 --> 02:30:35,960
Down.

3681
02:30:36,500 --> 02:30:37,440
Down.

3682
02:30:45,200 --> 02:30:46,980
Not- Not down.

3683
02:30:49,680 --> 02:30:50,160
Dead.

3684
02:30:51,680 --> 02:30:52,160
Oh.

3685
02:30:54,660 --> 02:30:55,000
Oh.

3686
02:30:55,860 --> 02:30:56,180
Oh.

Oh.

Up.

3689
02:31:00,380 --> 02:31:00,740
Down.

3690
02:31:01,660 --> 02:31:02,020
Where?

3691
02:31:06,240 --> 02:31:06,960
Wait.

3692
02:31:07,240 --> 02:31:07,280
Wait.

3693
02:31:07,520 --> 02:31:07,880
Oh.

3694
02:31:08,080 --> 02:31:09,060
Where do I go?

3695
02:31:09,520 --> 02:31:11,480
How do I get out of here?

3696
02:31:11,840 --> 02:31:13,580
You gotta die now?

3697
02:31:13,960 --> 02:31:14,660
Oh.

3698
02:31:14,700 --> 02:31:15,360
Not down.

3699
02:31:15,720 --> 02:31:16,840
Not down.

3700
02:31:19,940 --> 02:31:22,180
She'll collect this race though.

3701
02:31:22,380 --> 02:31:24,340
Where the f- Okay.

3702
02:31:24,820 --> 02:31:25,540
Okay.

Okay.

3704
02:31:27,480 --> 02:31:28,040
What's that?

3705
02:31:29,520 --> 02:31:30,120
What's that?

3706
02:31:31,180 --> 02:31:32,280
Oh, they're the cubes!

3707
02:31:32,840 --> 02:31:34,940
She must have to leave because of- Okay.

3708
02:31:35,420 --> 02:31:35,900
Okay.

3709
02:31:37,360 --> 02:31:37,840
Okay.

3710
02:31:38,120 --> 02:31:39,880
We have to go this door.

3711
02:31:41,800 --> 02:31:42,280
Here.

3712
02:31:48,310 --> 02:31:48,790
Okay.

3713
02:31:48,910 --> 02:31:49,270
Not that.

3714
02:31:49,470 --> 02:31:50,510
Clearly not that.

3715
02:31:50,670 --> 02:31:51,070
Oh!

3716
02:31:51,510 --> 02:31:56,280
Oh my god!

3717
02:31:58,420 --> 02:31:59,520
That's all I had to do?

3718
02:32:01,360 --> 02:32:03,040
That's all I had to do?

3719
02:32:05,140 --> 02:32:05,700
Up!

3720
02:32:06,320 --> 02:32:07,600
It was up!

3721
02:32:10,220 --> 02:32:10,900
It was up!

3722
02:32:10,900 --> 02:32:13,220
Pull the fridge out of kids- Up.

3723
02:32:14,720 --> 02:32:15,200
Down.

3724
02:32:15,420 --> 02:32:16,480
It was up.

3725
02:32:16,720 --> 02:32:18,900
It wasn't even a puzzle.

3726
02:32:21,400 --> 02:32:22,180
Oh shit.

3727
02:32:22,280 --> 02:32:23,440
It's the PS5 chat.

3728
02:32:23,520 --> 02:32:23,920
Look at that.

3729
02:32:23,980 --> 02:32:24,700
The PS5.

3730
02:32:28,900 --> 02:32:29,760
Look at here.

3731
02:32:29,920 --> 02:32:30,020
Look at here.

3732
02:32:32,540 --> 02:32:33,100
Okay.

3733
02:32:33,320 --> 02:32:33,880
Okay.

3734
02:32:33,920 --> 02:32:35,560
No, I left but I'm back now.

3735
02:32:35,620 --> 02:32:37,340
The sheets they wave all the time.

3736
02:32:37,960 --> 02:32:38,520
Okay.

3737
02:32:40,980 --> 02:32:41,540
Alright.

3738
02:32:44,420 --> 02:32:44,980
Okay.

3739
02:32:51,330 --> 02:32:51,890
Okay.

3740
02:32:51,950 --> 02:32:52,070
Okay.

3741
02:32:52,530 --> 02:32:53,630
Do I break this?

3742
02:32:54,070 --> 02:32:54,930
What do I do?

3743
02:32:55,410 --> 02:32:55,970
Wait.

3744
02:32:56,530 --> 02:32:57,090
Up?

3745
02:32:57,490 --> 02:32:58,050
No.

3746
02:32:59,010 --> 02:32:59,890
No up.

3747
02:33:00,270 --> 02:33:00,830
Oh wait.

3748
02:33:00,830 --> 02:33:02,550
Door.

3749
02:33:05,050 --> 02:33:06,010
Okay.

3750
02:33:07,990 --> 02:33:08,950
Okay.

3751
02:33:09,710 --> 02:33:10,670
Okay.

3752
02:33:12,490 --> 02:33:13,450
Door?

3753
02:33:14,370 --> 02:33:15,330
Break?

3754
02:33:16,370 --> 02:33:17,330
Break?

3755
02:33:18,770 --> 02:33:21,430
Do I do a toddlers thing?

3756
02:33:22,750 --> 02:33:25,090
I don't know what I'm doing.

3757
02:33:25,550 --> 02:33:26,450
Chained.

3758
02:33:26,570 --> 02:33:27,330
Now down.

3759
02:33:27,810 --> 02:33:29,010
Am I stuck?

3760
02:33:29,750 --> 02:33:30,490
Am I stuck?

3761
02:33:30,490 --> 02:33:30,810
I'm stuck.

3762
02:33:30,830 --> 02:33:32,690
I'm stuck.

3763
02:33:34,470 --> 02:33:35,950
Where do I go?

3764
02:33:37,090 --> 02:33:38,970
I opened all the doors.

3765
02:33:39,170 --> 02:33:41,030
What does he want me to do?

3766
02:33:42,610 --> 02:33:44,570
You seem a bit odd tonight.

3767
02:33:44,970 --> 02:33:45,790
Oh my god.

3768
02:33:45,830 --> 02:33:46,190
Sorry.

3769
02:33:46,370 --> 02:33:47,470
Sorry my brain.

3770
02:33:48,970 --> 02:33:50,250
I'm trying.

3771
02:33:50,250 --> 02:33:52,310
I don't know what's going on anymore.

3772
02:33:52,650 --> 02:33:53,290
Okay.

3773
02:33:53,350 --> 02:33:54,310
I went through two doors.

3774
02:33:55,010 --> 02:33:55,650
Oh.

3775
02:33:57,530 --> 02:33:58,170
Wait.

3776
02:33:59,570 --> 02:34:00,810
Where's door for this?

3777
02:34:00,830 --> 02:34:02,630
Where's the door for this?

3778
02:34:03,290 --> 02:34:03,910
Oh.

3779
02:34:04,620 --> 02:34:04,930
There's...

3780
02:34:08,820 --> 02:34:10,240
There's another way.

3781
02:34:16,320 --> 02:34:17,780
There's the other way.

3782
02:34:17,860 --> 02:34:18,480
Okay.

3783
02:34:18,540 --> 02:34:21,340
But it's been so long trying to open this door.

3784
02:34:22,420 --> 02:34:25,640
I thought we had to go this way.

3785
02:34:28,240 --> 02:34:30,360
I hear some of all that thinking.

3786
02:34:30,840 --> 02:34:33,000
Does this feel like Tokio's easel?

3787
02:34:33,320 --> 02:34:33,500
Oh.

3788
02:34:34,040 --> 02:34:35,760
Hey, don't give me brick hole.

3789
02:34:36,820 --> 02:34:37,340
Okay.

3790
02:34:38,780 --> 02:34:39,300
Okay.

3791
02:34:39,860 --> 02:34:40,860
Where are we?

3792
02:34:42,040 --> 02:34:42,560
Alright.

3793
02:34:43,640 --> 02:34:44,160
Hole.

3794
02:34:45,480 --> 02:34:48,160
Also, thank you so much for the follow.

3795
02:34:50,060 --> 02:34:51,100
Thank you.

3796
02:34:51,300 --> 02:34:52,060
Thank you.

3797
02:34:52,080 --> 02:34:52,560
Thank you.

3798
02:34:52,560 --> 02:34:52,560
Thank you.

3799
02:34:52,660 --> 02:34:54,420
I really do appreciate it.

3800
02:34:55,240 --> 02:34:56,580
I love butthurt.

3801
02:34:56,680 --> 02:34:57,760
Thank you so much.

3802
02:34:58,160 --> 02:35:00,380
Your brain has overclocked too much already.

3803
02:35:00,620 --> 02:35:01,920
And it's starting to circulate.

3804
02:35:01,920 --> 02:35:02,140
So, I think...

3805
02:35:03,940 --> 02:35:06,600
That some of the room are all story.

3806
02:35:06,640 --> 02:35:08,080
Dude, I can barely fucking...

3807
02:35:08,080 --> 02:35:10,860
I can barely process.

3808
02:35:11,040 --> 02:35:12,860
I can barely process what's going on right now.

3809
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,340
Let alone the story.

3810
02:35:16,300 --> 02:35:18,060
Let alone the story.

3811
02:35:19,500 --> 02:35:21,680
I can barely process shit.

3812
02:35:23,640 --> 02:35:25,300
Let's see how much I can push here.

3813
02:35:25,400 --> 02:35:27,260
Where the fuck am I?

3814
02:35:27,520 --> 02:35:28,600
Where the fuck am I?

3815
02:35:43,540 --> 02:35:46,980
Oh, girl McAfish, what?

3816
02:35:47,340 --> 02:35:47,880
No!

3817
02:35:48,980 --> 02:35:50,520
Oh, cool.

3818
02:35:51,600 --> 02:35:52,800
Oh!

3819
02:35:53,740 --> 02:35:54,880
Down!

3820
02:35:57,220 --> 02:35:58,420
Down!

3821
02:35:58,420 --> 02:35:59,440
Down!

3822
02:36:05,940 --> 02:36:07,480
Down, Pog!

3823
02:36:11,300 --> 02:36:13,920
Is Andrew Brookey the Beatrix, or is he?

3824
02:36:14,300 --> 02:36:15,180
We're right!

3825
02:36:18,620 --> 02:36:19,520
It's down!

3826
02:36:19,980 --> 02:36:20,660
Oh, shit!

3827
02:36:22,540 --> 02:36:23,220
Hey.

3828
02:36:25,260 --> 02:36:28,480
Did he really just enter Monkey Break Road up?

3829
02:36:28,860 --> 02:36:29,540
Down?

3830
02:36:31,620 --> 02:36:32,860
Where the fuck am I?

3831
02:36:34,560 --> 02:36:35,120
What?

3832
02:36:36,200 --> 02:36:37,040
Oh, down.

3833
02:36:39,940 --> 02:36:41,620
Okay, the test is over.

3834
02:36:41,780 --> 02:36:42,540
You win.

3835
02:36:42,820 --> 02:36:43,800
You're welcome.

3836
02:36:43,800 --> 02:36:45,620
But you have to remember your annex for your cake.

3837
02:36:46,080 --> 02:36:46,640
Wait.

3838
02:36:46,760 --> 02:36:50,880
It was a fun test, and we're all impressed at how much you won.

3839
02:36:51,020 --> 02:36:51,040
Okay, okay.

3840
02:36:51,220 --> 02:36:52,560
The test is over.

3841
02:36:52,800 --> 02:36:53,600
Come back.

3842
02:36:55,860 --> 02:36:56,420
Oh?

3843
02:37:14,260 --> 02:37:14,820
Oh!

3844
02:37:14,820 --> 02:37:15,100
Oh!

3845
02:37:15,980 --> 02:37:16,620
Oh!

3846
02:37:26,270 --> 02:37:28,090
Oh my god!

3847
02:37:28,630 --> 02:37:30,630
That was so cute!

3848
02:37:33,850 --> 02:37:37,030
You're literally one of the first muscles you ever did!

3849
02:37:39,930 --> 02:37:40,570
Look.

3850
02:37:41,970 --> 02:37:42,610
Look.

3851
02:37:43,150 --> 02:37:44,390
Look, I'm a mess right now.

3852
02:37:44,550 --> 02:37:45,470
I'm a mess.

3853
02:37:48,770 --> 02:37:50,810
I'm a fucking mess right now.

3854
02:38:07,300 --> 02:38:07,900
Door!

3855
02:38:09,320 --> 02:38:09,700
Oh!

3856
02:38:10,420 --> 02:38:11,900
Door, door, no, door.

3857
02:38:12,320 --> 02:38:13,260
Oh, oh!

3858
02:38:13,980 --> 02:38:15,540
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3859
02:38:20,090 --> 02:38:20,690
No?

3860
02:38:30,500 --> 02:38:32,100
They're like watching what the...

3861
02:38:32,100 --> 02:38:33,660
Or it looks bad.

3862
02:38:33,980 --> 02:38:35,880
Like, here's Doobie turning.

3863
02:38:37,780 --> 02:38:38,960
My brain moved.

3864
02:38:39,060 --> 02:38:39,900
My brain moved fast.

3865
02:38:40,160 --> 02:38:41,760
My brain... brain moved...

3866
02:38:41,760 --> 02:38:42,980
Good job, Doobie!

3867
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:47,560
Ruby!

3868
02:38:48,100 --> 02:38:48,660
Ruby!

3869
02:38:50,320 --> 02:38:50,880
Ruby!

3870
02:38:51,320 --> 02:38:51,480
Ruby!

3871
02:38:52,300 --> 02:38:52,860
Ruby!

3872
02:38:53,220 --> 02:38:53,760
Ruby!

3873
02:38:55,280 --> 02:38:55,840
Okay.

3874
02:39:00,720 --> 02:39:02,100
Where did I come from?

3875
02:39:03,320 --> 02:39:05,260
Wait, where did I come from?

3876
02:39:05,580 --> 02:39:06,940
Oh, here, here, here.

3877
02:39:07,040 --> 02:39:07,280
Okay.

3878
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:08,560
Okay.

3879
02:39:10,080 --> 02:39:11,340
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

3880
02:39:12,060 --> 02:39:13,400
I move up.

3881
02:39:13,680 --> 02:39:14,240
Up.

3882
02:39:14,840 --> 02:39:15,400
Down.

3883
02:39:16,240 --> 02:39:17,660
Oh my god, Atlas!

3884
02:39:19,540 --> 02:39:22,100
Thank you for gifting a sub to Elsar!

3885
02:39:22,640 --> 02:39:24,520
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

3886
02:39:24,780 --> 02:39:26,820
I really do appreciate it.

3887
02:39:27,140 --> 02:39:27,520
Woo!

3888
02:39:27,800 --> 02:39:33,040
Can we get some work nights also for Atlas for gifting a sub to Elsar?

3889
02:39:33,160 --> 02:39:34,180
Thank you so much!

3890
02:39:34,640 --> 02:39:35,200
Okay.

3891
02:39:35,280 --> 02:39:37,760
That's the most words I've ever spoken since I've...

3892
02:39:37,780 --> 02:39:38,720
since I started this game.

3893
02:39:38,920 --> 02:39:39,900
That is...

3894
02:39:39,900 --> 02:39:42,820
That is the most words I've spoken tonight, chat.

3895
02:39:45,300 --> 02:39:46,020
Wait.

3896
02:39:46,180 --> 02:39:47,480
How... how go up?

3897
02:39:57,610 --> 02:39:58,330
No.

3898
02:39:59,110 --> 02:39:59,830
Wait.

3899
02:40:00,410 --> 02:40:01,430
Wait, wait, wait.

3900
02:40:02,530 --> 02:40:03,250
Oh!

3901
02:40:03,630 --> 02:40:04,330
No, wait.

3902
02:40:04,570 --> 02:40:05,050
Wait.

3903
02:40:10,980 --> 02:40:11,800
Now we're just...

3904
02:40:11,800 --> 02:40:13,080
Oh, there he is!

3905
02:40:13,100 --> 02:40:13,660
He's...

3906
02:40:15,980 --> 02:40:16,340
Hello?

3907
02:40:16,860 --> 02:40:17,100
Hello?

3908
02:40:23,960 --> 02:40:24,330
How?

3909
02:40:25,720 --> 02:40:26,040
How?

3910
02:40:26,200 --> 02:40:26,420
How?

3911
02:40:26,940 --> 02:40:27,680
Oh!

3912
02:40:32,210 --> 02:40:33,550
I'm so sorry!

3913
02:40:33,790 --> 02:40:35,210
I'm so sorry!

3914
02:40:38,870 --> 02:40:39,610
Yes...

3915
02:40:40,550 --> 02:40:41,670
Oh, no.

3916
02:40:42,230 --> 02:40:42,970
No...

3917
02:40:43,910 --> 02:40:45,430
Dang, it's bringing...

3918
02:40:45,430 --> 02:40:46,530
look at that.

3919
02:40:47,550 --> 02:40:48,150
Look at that chat.

3920
02:40:49,370 --> 02:40:50,510
Look at that chat.

3921
02:40:54,250 --> 02:40:54,850
Wait.

3922
02:41:00,530 --> 02:41:03,950
As you go back, the joy of hearing things out.

3923
02:41:04,410 --> 02:41:04,710
Oh!

3924
02:41:05,290 --> 02:41:09,360
Wait, where do I go?

3925
02:41:11,780 --> 02:41:13,260
Oh my god, Sire!

3926
02:41:14,460 --> 02:41:15,660
Holy shit!

3927
02:41:16,660 --> 02:41:17,260
Sire!

3928
02:41:18,060 --> 02:41:20,680
Thank you so much for giving me five subs!

3929
02:41:21,420 --> 02:41:22,920
Oh my god!

3930
02:41:23,740 --> 02:41:25,160
Thank you, thank you!

3931
02:41:25,280 --> 02:41:27,860
Can we get some bright nights real quick for Sire?

3932
02:41:28,380 --> 02:41:29,820
Thank you, everyone!

3933
02:41:30,700 --> 02:41:31,860
Oh my god!

3934
02:41:31,880 --> 02:41:33,460
Thank you guys so much!

3935
02:41:33,860 --> 02:41:37,400
I really, I really appreciate you guys!

3936
02:41:37,720 --> 02:41:39,840
I don't... Thank you guys!

3937
02:41:41,560 --> 02:41:45,800
My brain is going 200 miles per hour right now.

3938
02:41:45,960 --> 02:41:47,400
Thank you so much!

3939
02:41:47,660 --> 02:41:48,640
For... for...

3940
02:41:51,300 --> 02:41:53,160
For enabling my brain!

3941
02:41:53,900 --> 02:41:55,320
Thank you, Sire!

3942
02:41:57,400 --> 02:41:57,960
Wait...

3943
02:41:57,960 --> 02:41:58,000
Hello?

3944
02:41:58,960 --> 02:41:59,440
Hello?

3945
02:42:02,720 --> 02:42:05,340
Wait, just A's on the brain... Wait, here?

3946
02:42:07,100 --> 02:42:07,660
Here?

3947
02:42:08,500 --> 02:42:09,060
Where?

3948
02:42:10,860 --> 02:42:12,140
I'm gonna go for the night.

3949
02:42:12,320 --> 02:42:13,320
That was nice of you.

3950
02:42:13,340 --> 02:42:14,620
Don't bring your brain out!

3951
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:15,980
Alright, Alice!

3952
02:42:16,360 --> 02:42:18,040
Thanks for hanging out with us!

3953
02:42:18,240 --> 02:42:19,020
Thank you!

3954
02:42:19,740 --> 02:42:20,860
I really do appreciate it!

3955
02:42:20,940 --> 02:42:21,520
Door?

3956
02:42:21,760 --> 02:42:23,040

3958
02:42:24,240 --> 02:42:24,960
No portal.

02:45:48,300 --> 02:45:49,220
No, not up!

4070
02:45:51,480 --> 02:45:51,960
Yay!

4071
02:45:52,060 --> 02:45:53,000
Give the subs do count!

4072
02:45:53,360 --> 02:45:55,020

4073
02:45:55,160 --> 02:45:55,440

4074
02:45:55,880 --> 02:45:57,100
Holy shit, guys!

4075
02:45:57,420 --> 02:45:57,900

4076
02:45:59,660 --> 02:46:00,140

4077
02:46:01,240 --> 02:46:01,720
No!

4078
02:46:01,920 --> 02:46:02,860
Not down!

4079
02:46:03,620 --> 02:46:04,100
Alright!

4080
02:46:04,660 --> 02:46:05,720
Like I said!

4081
02:46:05,920 --> 02:46:08,060
When we hit our sub goal!

4082
02:46:08,160 --> 02:46:08,900
Which was 200 subs!

4083
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:09,760
I think we hit it!

4084
02:46:11,840 --> 02:46:12,640
So basically...

4085
02:46:12,640 --> 02:46:13,080
Blood!

4086
02:46:13,260 --> 02:46:13,660
Where am I?

4087
02:46:15,960 --> 02:46:16,760
So basically...

4088
02:46:16,760 --> 02:46:18,720
You guys choose...

4089
02:46:19,640 --> 02:46:20,040
Um...

4090
02:46:20,040 --> 02:46:21,780
You guys basically choose...

4091
02:46:21,780 --> 02:46:24,200
What spooky game I'm playing.

4092
02:46:24,480 --> 02:46:25,940
So I'm gonna make a poll.

4093
02:46:26,300 --> 02:46:27,240
It'll be in my Discord.

4094
02:46:27,380 --> 02:46:28,320
We're gonna vote in my Discord.

4095
02:46:28,380 --> 02:46:29,600
So you guys are not in my Discord yet.

4096
02:46:29,880 --> 02:46:32,160
It's !Discord to join it.

4097
02:46:32,220 --> 02:46:34,940
And we're gonna do a little poll there for you guys to choose...

4098
02:46:34,940 --> 02:46:36,000
Choose the...

4099
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:38,200
The spooky game that I'll play.

4100
02:46:38,300 --> 02:46:39,660
And it's not gonna be just a one stream thing.

4101
02:46:39,820 --> 02:46:40,400
It'll be like...

4102
02:46:40,560 --> 02:46:41,380
Multiple streams.

4103
02:46:41,620 --> 02:46:44,920
Until either I finish it, or I say fuck you guys and stop playing!

4104
02:46:46,540 --> 02:46:48,480
Oh no thank you so much for the follow, Lido!

4105
02:46:48,780 --> 02:46:50,080
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

4106
02:46:50,220 --> 02:46:51,880
I really do appreciate... Jesus Christ!

4107
02:46:52,180 --> 02:46:53,060
How about butter?

4108
02:46:53,160 --> 02:46:55,600
I honestly didn't think variety stream...

4109
02:46:55,600 --> 02:46:58,260
People would like my variety stream.

4110
02:46:58,480 --> 02:47:00,380
Because this is the first time I've done a variety stream.

4111
02:47:00,700 --> 02:47:02,940
And I didn't think you guys would like...

4112
02:47:02,940 --> 02:47:04,200
Oh wait...

4113
02:47:05,760 --> 02:47:06,200
Up.

4114
02:47:07,760 --> 02:47:08,200

4115
02:47:08,520 --> 02:47:08,960
Up.

4116
02:47:09,020 --> 02:47:09,480
You see that?

4117
02:47:09,880 --> 02:47:10,320
Up.

4118
02:47:11,800 --> 02:47:14,560
I'm so happy you guys like my variety stream.

4119
02:47:14,760 --> 02:47:15,280
Because like...

4120
02:47:15,280 --> 02:47:18,760
I didn't know... I've never done a variety stream before.

4121
02:47:19,140 --> 02:47:19,960
And like...

4122
02:47:19,960 --> 02:47:22,620
I was so scared that people won't like it.

4123
02:47:22,960 --> 02:47:24,660
So I'm really happy that...

4124
02:47:24,660 --> 02:47:26,200
People are enjoying this.

4125
02:47:26,420 --> 02:47:28,220
And enjoying... joining my...

4126
02:47:28,220 --> 02:47:29,260
My big brain.

4127
02:47:30,320 --> 02:47:31,560
My ginormous brain.

4128
02:47:33,960 --> 02:47:34,600

4129
02:47:36,360 --> 02:47:37,000

4131
02:47:37,700 --> 02:47:37,800
Up?

4132
02:47:50,240 --> 02:47:50,960
Wait...

Up...

4142
02:48:25,760 --> 02:48:27,820
Never tell yourself...

4143
02:48:27,820 --> 02:48:30,260
I'm glad you guys are having a good time!

4144
02:48:31,100 --> 02:48:31,820

02:48:32,160 --> 02:48:32,840
Brain...

4146
02:48:33,900 --> 02:48:34,540
Working...

4147
02:48:36,280 --> 02:48:37,560
Oh my god!

4148
02:48:37,680 --> 02:48:39,860
We got a level 5 Holy Peoples!

4149
02:48:40,020 --> 02:48:40,960
What did you guys get?

4150
02:48:41,920 --> 02:48:43,120

4151
02:48:43,120 --> 02:48:43,880

4152
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:45,640
Okay...

4153
02:48:46,940 --> 02:48:47,580
Okay...

4154
02:48:49,260 --> 02:48:49,900
Okay...

4155
02:48:52,400 --> 02:48:53,320

4156
02:48:54,340 --> 02:48:55,300
Choo choo!

4157
02:48:56,580 --> 02:48:57,820
How do I get up there?

4158
02:48:58,140 --> 02:48:59,080
What the fuck?

4159
02:48:59,080 --> 02:48:59,540
Oh my god!

4160
02:49:00,460 --> 02:49:00,480
Oh my god!

4161
02:49:00,480 --> 02:49:00,920
Oh my god!

4162
02:49:00,920 --> 02:49:01,300
Oh my god!

4163
02:49:08,020 --> 02:49:08,740
Wait...

4164
02:49:08,740 --> 02:49:09,520
Up?

4165
02:49:12,040 --> 02:49:13,440
No feet today.

4166
02:49:13,720 --> 02:49:15,240
No feet today chat.

4167
02:49:22,280 --> 02:49:23,000
Here?

4168
02:49:35,440 --> 02:49:36,760
We went back!

4169
02:49:36,980 --> 02:49:37,580
Okay...

4170
02:49:37,580 --> 02:49:39,040
Oh wait where's my portal?

4171
02:49:39,440 --> 02:49:40,160
Wait...

4172
02:49:40,160 --> 02:49:40,720
Oh!

4173
02:49:40,840 --> 02:49:41,300
Wait!

4174
02:49:41,580 --> 02:49:44,860
What color was it?

4175
02:49:44,980 --> 02:49:45,900
What color was it?

4176
02:49:47,320 --> 02:49:48,520
I don't remember!

4177
02:49:48,940 --> 02:49:50,700
What color was that portal chat?

4178
02:49:51,140 --> 02:49:51,700
Orange...

4179
02:49:53,540 --> 02:49:54,100
Oh...

4180
02:49:55,060 --> 02:49:56,060
I did it.

4181
02:49:59,840 --> 02:50:01,300
It was orange.

4182
02:50:02,620 --> 02:50:03,640
Did I do it?

4183
02:50:09,700 --> 02:50:10,400
Did I?

4184
02:50:10,400 --> 02:50:10,480
Okay...

4185
02:50:12,300 --> 02:50:13,980
Is this it?

4186
02:50:17,100 --> 02:50:17,900
Oh!

4187
02:50:18,340 --> 02:50:18,480
Oh!

4188
02:50:24,160 --> 02:50:24,960
Wait...

4189
02:50:24,960 --> 02:50:26,500
And then I was all...

4190
02:50:26,500 --> 02:50:29,020
We pretend if we were going to murder you...

4191
02:50:29,020 --> 02:50:29,720
Wait...

4192
02:50:29,720 --> 02:50:33,060
Maybe we're still expanding...

4193
02:50:33,900 --> 02:50:35,520
Is anyone there?

4194
02:50:38,720 --> 02:50:40,440
Maybe if I...

4195
02:50:40,440 --> 02:50:40,840
Maybe...

4196
02:50:41,840 --> 02:50:41,980
Oh!

4197
02:50:42,240 --> 02:50:42,780
Up!

4198
02:50:45,940 --> 02:50:47,220
I can't...

4199
02:50:47,220 --> 02:50:48,780
Every time...

4200
02:50:48,780 --> 02:50:50,000
It's just up!

4201
02:50:50,380 --> 02:50:51,700
It's just up chat!

4202
02:50:52,040 --> 02:50:53,700
It's very slow!

4203
02:50:54,520 --> 02:50:55,620
It's just up!

4204
02:50:55,820 --> 02:50:56,820
Wait... where the fuck...

4205
02:50:56,820 --> 02:50:57,360
No!

4206
02:50:57,500 --> 02:50:57,800
No!

4207
02:50:57,800 --> 02:50:58,120
No!

4208
02:51:00,920 --> 02:51:02,760
It was not up.

4209
02:51:06,210 --> 02:51:08,130
It was not up.

4210
02:51:11,850 --> 02:51:13,510
I'm off to WB back later.

4211
02:51:13,610 --> 02:51:14,230
I hate CJ!

4212
02:51:14,710 --> 02:51:16,230
Let me have a good dinner!

4213
02:51:17,250 --> 02:51:19,270
I know we have a good dinner!

4214
02:51:20,950 --> 02:51:22,270
It wasn't up!

4215
02:51:23,590 --> 02:51:25,010
It wasn't up!

4216
02:51:25,770 --> 02:51:25,930
It wasn't up!

4217
02:51:26,050 --> 02:51:28,390
It wasn't up!

4218
02:51:28,930 --> 02:51:29,450
Okay...

4219
02:51:30,050 --> 02:51:30,570
Wait...

4220
02:51:31,590 --> 02:51:32,110
Okay...

4221
02:51:32,110 --> 02:51:32,370
Okay...

4222
02:51:33,070 --> 02:51:33,410
Up!

4223
02:51:35,770 --> 02:51:37,150
Okay, I need to time this.

4224
02:51:37,290 --> 02:51:37,990
I need to...

4225
02:51:38,130 --> 02:51:40,070
I need to time up.

4226
02:51:40,810 --> 02:51:41,490
I...

4227
02:51:42,130 --> 02:51:42,490
I...

4228
02:51:42,490 --> 02:51:43,050
Oh!

4229
02:51:43,510 --> 02:51:44,130
Oh!

4230
02:51:44,310 --> 02:51:46,770
Oh, I know, I know, I know, I know.

4231
02:51:46,890 --> 02:51:47,570
Up.

4232
02:51:48,610 --> 02:51:51,510
Well, on the upside, you know...

4233
02:51:51,810 --> 02:51:52,150
What?

4234
02:51:52,250 --> 02:51:52,750
Why?

4235
02:51:53,090 --> 02:51:53,730
Why?

4236
02:51:54,970 --> 02:51:57,390
I forgot to put the portal!

4237
02:51:57,730 --> 02:51:59,990
I forgot to put the portal!

4238
02:52:02,670 --> 02:52:05,410
I forgot to put the portal!

4239
02:52:10,670 --> 02:52:11,150
Okay...

4240
02:52:13,270 --> 02:52:13,750
Okay...

4241
02:52:16,790 --> 02:52:17,270
Okay...

4242
02:52:17,270 --> 02:52:17,890
Okay...

4243
02:52:17,890 --> 02:52:18,050
Okay...

4244
02:52:18,050 --> 02:52:18,470
Okay, okay, okay...

4245
02:52:21,110 --> 02:52:22,070
This is...

4246
02:52:22,070 --> 02:52:23,310
Okay, right, this is...

4247
02:52:24,050 --> 02:52:24,530
Okay...

4248
02:52:25,410 --> 02:52:26,190
Here we go.

4249
02:52:27,190 --> 02:52:28,110
There we go, okay.

4250
02:52:28,230 --> 02:52:29,490
I am facing it.

4251
02:52:29,930 --> 02:52:30,830
I am...

4252
02:52:31,370 --> 02:52:31,850
Yeah...

4253
02:52:32,630 --> 02:52:34,270
Please, please let me through.

4254
02:52:34,630 --> 02:52:35,110
No!

4255
02:52:35,290 --> 02:52:36,290
Wait, wait, no, no, no!

4256
02:52:38,130 --> 02:52:39,850
Wait, wait, how do I do this?

4257
02:52:39,890 --> 02:52:40,870
How do I...

4258
02:52:40,870 --> 02:52:42,030
How do I do this?

4259
02:52:44,450 --> 02:52:45,050
Okay...

4260
02:52:45,050 --> 02:52:46,090
Okay...

4261
02:52:46,090 --> 02:52:47,010
What?

4262
02:52:49,010 --> 02:52:49,610
What?

4263
02:52:49,970 --> 02:52:51,310
I am so confused!

4264
02:52:52,150 --> 02:52:53,350
Is it not...

4265
02:52:53,350 --> 02:52:53,830
Is it...

4266
02:52:53,830 --> 02:52:54,210
What?

4267
02:52:56,390 --> 02:52:58,310
How is this hard?

4268
02:52:58,610 --> 02:52:59,150
How?

4269
02:53:02,130 --> 02:53:02,730
How?

4270
02:53:03,650 --> 02:53:04,250
Angles!

4271
02:53:04,290 --> 02:53:05,470
Okay, okay, geometry.

4272
02:53:05,470 --> 02:53:06,730
It is simple geometry.

4273
02:53:06,970 --> 02:53:08,030
It is geometry.

4274
02:53:08,290 --> 02:53:08,830
I got this.

4275
02:53:09,070 --> 02:53:10,930
It is just geometry, right?

4276
02:53:11,630 --> 02:53:13,450
It is just geometry.

4277
02:53:15,130 --> 02:53:15,690
Up.

4278
02:53:17,610 --> 02:53:19,390
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

4279
02:53:19,730 --> 02:53:20,290
Okay.

4280
02:53:22,270 --> 02:53:23,230
Okay, okay.

4281
02:53:23,670 --> 02:53:26,820
Oh, oh, oh!

Brain.

4316
02:54:20,240 --> 02:54:20,920
Brain.

4317
02:54:24,520 --> 02:54:25,100
Brain.

4318
02:54:26,240 --> 02:54:26,700

Haha!

02:55:07,450 --> 02:55:08,290
Oh!

4331
02:55:12,990 --> 02:55:13,830
Up.

02:55:13,990 --> 02:55:14,750
Hahaha!

4333
02:55:15,670 --> 02:55:17,570
Oh, I am so smart!

4334
02:55:18,170 --> 02:55:18,950
Look at that.

4335
02:55:20,410 --> 02:55:21,710
Oh, never mind.

4336
02:55:21,830 --> 02:55:22,850
I am trapped here.

4337
02:55:23,070 --> 02:55:23,630
Hahaha!

4338
02:55:24,890 --> 02:55:27,570

03:01:52,680 --> 03:01:53,360
How?

4531
03:01:55,980 --> 03:01:56,660
Jump?

4532
03:01:57,820 --> 03:01:58,500
How?

4533
03:02:00,800 --> 03:02:01,280
How?

4534
03:02:01,720 --> 03:02:02,740
Jump here.

4535
03:02:03,900 --> 03:02:04,580
Oh!

4536
03:02:04,760 --> 03:02:05,320
No, don't jump!

4537
03:02:05,500 --> 03:02:05,840
Don't jump!

4538
03:02:11,770 --> 03:02:13,150
Oh my god.

4539
03:02:13,430 --> 03:02:15,410
Ruby, can we get some sub 2?

4540
03:02:15,550 --> 03:02:16,550
The park night!

4541
03:02:17,090 --> 03:02:20,470
Can we get some park nightzoo quick?

4542
03:02:20,810 --> 03:02:21,870
For Ruby.

4543
03:02:22,430 --> 03:02:23,650
Thank you guys!

4544
03:02:23,770 --> 03:02:24,390
Thank you!

4545
03:02:24,510 --> 03:02:28,310
And also, thank you so much for the five bits!

4546
03:02:28,650 --> 03:02:30,330
Thank you, thank you guys!

4547
03:02:30,710 --> 03:02:32,090
Wait, where the fuck was I?

4548
03:02:32,270 --> 03:02:32,770
Okay.

4549
03:02:32,990 --> 03:02:34,430
We got this, we got this.

4550
03:02:35,690 --> 03:02:36,730
Brain upgrade!

4551
03:02:37,350 --> 03:02:37,790
Brain upgrade.

4552
03:02:38,530 --> 03:02:39,050
Here?

4553
03:02:40,410 --> 03:02:40,930
Here.

4554
03:02:41,270 --> 03:02:41,910
Alright, alright.

4555
03:02:42,030 --> 03:02:43,570
We gotta wait until this thing goes down.

4556
03:02:43,930 --> 03:02:45,830
And then... BAM!

4557
03:02:47,070 --> 03:02:47,870
Look at that.

4558
03:02:48,070 --> 03:02:48,690
First try.

4559
03:02:48,930 --> 03:02:49,750
No deaths.

4560
03:02:49,910 --> 03:02:51,430
Look at him bunny hopping right now.

4561
03:02:51,870 --> 03:02:52,270
I'm gonna get some roots, you guys.

4562
03:02:52,350 --> 03:02:52,610
Open?

4563
03:02:53,130 --> 03:02:53,950
No open.

4564
03:02:56,150 --> 03:02:59,690
Park night is a park night perfectly balanced as all things should be!

4565
03:03:01,110 --> 03:03:01,990
Oh my god.

4566
03:03:02,550 --> 03:03:04,150
Is this another rat?

4567
03:03:04,270 --> 03:03:05,990
Oh, this is like another...

4568
03:03:05,990 --> 03:03:06,950
The rat thingy.

4569
03:03:07,430 --> 03:03:07,910
Okay.

4570
03:03:08,770 --> 03:03:10,370
All we have to do...

4571
03:03:11,510 --> 03:03:12,890
Is go through here.

4572
03:03:13,770 --> 03:03:14,250
What?

4573
03:03:14,350 --> 03:03:14,670
What?

4574
03:03:14,670 --> 03:03:14,930

4575
03:03:15,350 --> 03:03:15,830
Okay.

4579
03:03:22,490 --> 03:03:22,850
Wait!

4580
03:03:22,850 --> 03:03:23,830

4581
03:03:23,990 --> 03:03:24,710

4582
03:03:28,610 --> 03:03:29,010
Wait.

Wait.

4584
03:03:31,510 --> 03:03:32,790
I don't have cubes.

4585
03:03:33,710 --> 03:03:34,110
Oh!

4586
03:03:36,510 --> 03:03:36,910

03:03:36,950 --> 03:03:37,330

Okay, wait, I got this.

4591
03:03:43,730 --> 03:03:44,430
I got this.

4592
03:03:44,590 --> 03:03:45,530
I don't need cubes.

4593
03:03:45,530 --> 03:03:46,790
I don't need cubes.

4594
03:03:47,090 --> 03:03:48,510
I don't need my cubes.

4595
03:03:49,810 --> 03:03:51,210
Okay, which one's the first one?

4596
03:03:51,490 --> 03:03:52,610
Is this the first one?

4597
03:03:53,510 --> 03:03:54,450
Yeah, you thought...

4598
03:03:54,450 --> 03:03:55,210
You thought you're better?

4599
03:03:55,490 --> 03:03:55,890
Yeah!

4600
03:03:56,690 --> 03:03:57,890
I don't need cubes!

4601
03:03:58,430 --> 03:03:59,490
Where's the second one?

4602
03:03:59,710 --> 03:04:02,350
I don't need cubes, are you serious?

4603
03:04:04,650 --> 03:04:05,890
I don't need cubes.

4604
03:04:07,090 --> 03:04:09,210
Wait, wait, where's the third one?

4605
03:04:09,470 --> 03:04:10,190
Where's the third one?

4606
03:04:12,070 --> 03:04:12,530
Wait.

4607
03:04:12,530 --> 03:04:13,870
Wait, I don't need...

4608
03:04:15,610 --> 03:04:16,730
I don't need cubes.

4609
03:04:17,050 --> 03:04:18,170
I don't need cubes.

4610
03:04:19,710 --> 03:04:20,730
Wait, wait, wait.

4611
03:04:20,890 --> 03:04:21,690
Are you hitting me?

4612
03:04:24,370 --> 03:04:24,770
Oh!

4613
03:04:24,790 --> 03:04:25,090
No!

4614
03:04:28,910 --> 03:04:29,810
That's how you do it.

4615
03:04:30,530 --> 03:04:31,490
That's how you do it.

4616
03:04:32,770 --> 03:04:34,610
It keeps over portal guns.

4617
03:04:35,430 --> 03:04:36,570
That's how you do it, chat.

4618
03:04:37,190 --> 03:04:38,570
That's how you kill a lot...

4619
03:04:38,570 --> 03:04:39,790
You don't need portals.

4620
03:04:40,190 --> 03:04:41,850
You don't need portals.

4621
03:04:42,330 --> 03:04:44,130
Also, thank you so much for the follow-up.

4622
03:04:44,470 --> 03:04:45,590
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

4623
03:04:45,650 --> 03:04:46,870
I really appreciate it.

4624
03:04:46,890 --> 03:04:47,730
Have a butter.

4625
03:04:47,810 --> 03:04:48,310
Thank you.

4626
03:04:48,510 --> 03:04:49,770
You don't need portals.

4627
03:04:50,090 --> 03:04:51,730
Okay, how do I get out of here though?

4628
03:04:52,150 --> 03:04:52,610
Oh.

4629
03:05:00,290 --> 03:05:01,490
Am I stuck?

4630
03:05:03,750 --> 03:05:06,170
Wait, wait, wait.

4631
03:05:06,910 --> 03:05:07,430
Okay.

4632
03:05:09,110 --> 03:05:10,750
Okay, I got stuck there.

4633
03:05:11,370 --> 03:05:11,890
Okay.

4634
03:05:12,630 --> 03:05:13,150
Ha.

4635
03:05:33,010 --> 03:05:33,530
Stop.

4636
03:05:35,290 --> 03:05:35,810
Stop.

4637
03:05:35,810 --> 03:05:35,870
Stop.

4638
03:05:39,290 --> 03:05:39,510
Oh!

4639
03:05:53,550 --> 03:05:54,690
Okay, not up.

4640
03:05:54,890 --> 03:05:55,850
Not up.

4641
03:05:56,690 --> 03:05:58,110
Okay, it was not up.

4642
03:06:01,720 --> 03:06:02,440
Oh.

4643
03:06:10,800 --> 03:06:11,720
Where's up?

4644
03:06:11,920 --> 03:06:12,620
Oh, oh.

4645
03:06:15,840 --> 03:06:17,240
It is up.

4646
03:06:17,400 --> 03:06:18,400
We're up.

4647
03:06:18,940 --> 03:06:20,180
We're up.

4648
03:06:21,780 --> 03:06:22,520
We're up.

4649
03:06:24,960 --> 03:06:26,280
Hey, Cypher.

4650
03:06:27,120 --> 03:06:28,100
We're up.

4651
03:06:31,420 --> 03:06:32,380
Up where?

4652
03:06:34,800 --> 03:06:36,060
Up is up.

4653
03:06:37,540 --> 03:06:38,540
But where?

4654
03:06:41,420 --> 03:06:42,160
We're up.

4655
03:06:42,340 --> 03:06:43,120
We're like square.

4656
03:06:43,420 --> 03:06:44,860
But I just walked into.

4657
03:06:45,000 --> 03:06:45,880
Look up.

4658
03:06:46,240 --> 03:06:46,840
Okay.

4659
03:06:47,260 --> 03:06:48,780
Okay, one of these will hit.

4660
03:06:49,380 --> 03:06:49,980
Up?

4661
03:06:53,730 --> 03:06:54,970
At the grabber.

4662
03:06:55,030 --> 03:06:55,790
There was a sign?

4663
03:06:58,630 --> 03:06:59,230
Caution.

4664
03:07:00,550 --> 03:07:01,150
Oh!

4665
03:07:01,610 --> 03:07:02,130
Up!

4666
03:07:03,890 --> 03:07:04,530
Wait.

4667
03:07:05,410 --> 03:07:06,050
Up?

4668
03:07:06,290 --> 03:07:06,710
Up!

4669
03:07:06,930 --> 03:07:07,510
Up.

4670
03:07:20,160 --> 03:07:20,800
Up.

4671
03:07:25,500 --> 03:07:27,160
You're not making a person.

4672
03:07:27,420 --> 03:07:28,560
You know that, right?

4673
03:07:29,200 --> 03:07:30,280
Good people.

4674
03:07:30,620 --> 03:07:32,020
Don't get up here.

4675
03:07:33,500 --> 03:07:34,680
Can you hear me?

4676
03:07:35,800 --> 03:07:36,440
Okay.

4677
03:07:36,760 --> 03:07:37,400
Alright.

4678
03:07:37,960 --> 03:07:38,600
Okay.

4679
03:07:39,500 --> 03:07:42,380
Okay, imagine you're seeing this out of context.

4680
03:07:44,700 --> 03:07:45,380
Okay.

4681
03:07:46,560 --> 03:07:47,240
Okay.

4682
03:07:47,280 --> 03:07:47,500
Okay.

4683
03:07:47,500 --> 03:07:48,060
Oh no.

4684
03:07:48,560 --> 03:07:49,880
Oh no.

4685
03:07:50,840 --> 03:07:51,520
Wait.

4686
03:07:54,840 --> 03:07:55,520
Wait.

4687
03:07:59,930 --> 03:08:00,610
Okay.

4688
03:08:02,670 --> 03:08:03,350
Okay.

4689
03:08:03,830 --> 03:08:05,370
There is no goddess.

4690
03:08:05,630 --> 03:08:06,570
There is no goddess.

4691
03:08:06,790 --> 03:08:07,370
I'm here.

4692
03:08:07,590 --> 03:08:08,270
Okay.

4693
03:08:11,090 --> 03:08:12,970
Clearly I don't know how to jump either.

4694
03:08:14,150 --> 03:08:14,830
Alright.

4695
03:08:20,440 --> 03:08:23,540
I came here out of context and was lost as fuck.

4696
03:08:30,210 --> 03:08:31,530
I used the portal.

4697
03:08:31,970 --> 03:08:32,950
Ha ha ha.

4698
03:08:32,950 --> 03:08:36,730
This is the first time I used a portal for these guys.

4699
03:08:37,670 --> 03:08:38,570
I'm gonna be like.

4700
03:08:38,750 --> 03:08:38,830
Here.

4701
03:08:39,010 --> 03:08:39,450
Thank you.

4702
03:08:39,590 --> 03:08:46,050
This is the first time we use a fucking portal for these things.

4703
03:08:46,170 --> 03:08:46,350
This is the first time we use portal for these things.

4704
03:08:46,350 --> 03:08:47,030
Cause we have no...

4705
03:08:47,030 --> 03:08:48,150
We don't have a cube.

4706
03:08:48,810 --> 03:08:49,970
We don't have cube.

4707
03:08:49,970 --> 03:08:50,310
No cube.

4708
03:08:50,310 --> 03:08:50,930
No cube.

4709
03:08:51,310 --> 03:08:52,410
What the fuck?

4710
03:08:53,770 --> 03:08:54,410
Oh...

4711
03:09:02,160 --> 03:09:03,300
No cube.

4712
03:09:03,400 --> 03:09:03,860
No cube.

4713
03:09:04,380 --> 03:09:06,800
We actually have to... over here...

4714
03:09:06,800 --> 03:09:07,860
Oh my god, there's instructions.

4715
03:09:08,620 --> 03:09:09,560
There's instructions.

4716
03:09:12,500 --> 03:09:13,140
What?

4717
03:09:13,840 --> 03:09:17,640
Okay, that was not a good instruction.

4718
03:09:18,020 --> 03:09:19,920
Oh wait, is he pointing up?

4719
03:09:22,240 --> 03:09:22,880
Is he...

4720
03:09:24,920 --> 03:09:26,240
Improvise, adapt, overcome.

4721
03:09:26,920 --> 03:09:27,360
Oh!

4722
03:09:29,860 --> 03:09:31,760
Oh, he was pointing at this!

4723
03:09:32,960 --> 03:09:34,120
I was like...

4724
03:09:34,120 --> 03:09:36,040
Up, or forward.

4725
03:09:36,120 --> 03:09:37,700
I thought he was talking about forward.

4726
03:09:37,820 --> 03:09:38,960
I was like, what do you mean?

4727
03:09:39,660 --> 03:09:40,620
What do you mean?

4728
03:09:40,760 --> 03:09:42,220
Matt, you guys make me laugh.

4729
03:09:42,380 --> 03:09:43,420
Am I because of the alcohol in the house?

4730
03:09:43,460 --> 03:09:44,340
You still make me laugh.

4731
03:09:44,600 --> 03:09:46,460
GG with the portal.

4732
03:09:47,280 --> 03:09:48,740
Oh, good luck with the portal.

4733
03:09:49,260 --> 03:09:50,320
Thank you, Phoenix.

4734
03:09:50,700 --> 03:09:51,960
Okay, up.

4735
03:10:02,320 --> 03:10:02,880
Oh!

4736
03:10:02,880 --> 03:10:03,240
Oh!

4737
03:10:03,480 --> 03:10:03,900
Oh...

4738
03:10:11,990 --> 03:10:13,050
Oh?

4739
03:10:15,770 --> 03:10:16,330
Oh!

4740
03:10:16,410 --> 03:10:17,370
Okay, it's blue.

4741
03:10:17,570 --> 03:10:20,190
Okay, remember to use orange.

4742
03:10:21,270 --> 03:10:21,830
Okay,

4743
03:10:25,510 --> 03:10:26,050
wait, wait, wait.

4744
03:10:26,910 --> 03:10:28,050
Okay, okay, wait.

4745
03:10:29,170 --> 03:10:30,030
Okay, wait.

4746
03:10:31,370 --> 03:10:32,590
Okay, okay, wait.

4747
03:10:33,090 --> 03:10:33,370
Wait.

4748
03:10:33,970 --> 03:10:34,530
Wait.

4749
03:10:36,110 --> 03:10:36,390
Yeah!

4750
03:10:37,130 --> 03:10:37,450
Oh.

4751
03:10:37,990 --> 03:10:38,550
Wait.

4752
03:10:39,630 --> 03:10:40,070
Okay.

4753
03:10:40,350 --> 03:10:41,310
Okay, wait.

4754
03:10:42,930 --> 03:10:43,830
We got this.

4755
03:10:44,370 --> 03:10:44,810
Wait.

4756
03:10:45,010 --> 03:10:45,330
Guys!

4757
03:10:45,510 --> 03:10:46,390
Fucking first try.

4758
03:10:47,510 --> 03:10:48,810
All we had to do was wait.

4759
03:10:49,350 --> 03:10:51,110
All we had to do was wait.

4760
03:10:52,430 --> 03:10:53,170
Look at that.

4761
03:10:53,270 --> 03:10:53,910
We waited.

4762
03:10:54,310 --> 03:10:54,750
This is your fault.

4763
03:10:55,330 --> 03:10:57,410
It didn't have to be like this.

4764
03:10:57,610 --> 03:10:58,290
I can open doors.

4765
03:10:58,710 --> 03:10:59,350
Please try.

4766
03:10:59,490 --> 03:10:59,890
Please try.

4767
03:11:00,170 --> 03:11:00,650
Turn back.

4768
03:11:00,670 --> 03:11:01,430
Holy shit.

4769
03:11:02,170 --> 03:11:02,610
It...

4770
03:11:02,610 --> 03:11:05,510
Whoa, my God, we only been playing this game for 50 minutes.

4771
03:11:06,310 --> 03:11:09,130
We've only played this game for 50 minutes.

4772
03:11:09,210 --> 03:11:09,290
We're gonna die.

4773
03:11:09,290 --> 03:11:10,950
And we're almost finished with this game.

4774
03:11:11,050 --> 03:11:12,110
Isn't that crazy, chat?

4775
03:11:13,390 --> 03:11:14,730
Only 50 minutes.

4776
03:11:15,150 --> 03:11:16,590
Yeah, don't trust Nightbot.

4777
03:11:16,630 --> 03:11:17,990
Nightbot's being weird right now.

4778
03:11:18,210 --> 03:11:20,130
There's like a bug right now with Nightbot.

4779
03:11:20,270 --> 03:11:21,990
But it's only been 50 minutes.

4780
03:11:25,310 --> 03:11:25,930
What's that?

4781
03:11:27,790 --> 03:11:28,610
No, 50.

4782
03:11:30,050 --> 03:11:30,530
Hi.

4783
03:11:30,750 --> 03:11:31,150
Oh!

4784
03:11:31,470 --> 03:11:34,610
Let me out.

4785
03:11:34,670 --> 03:11:35,090
Let me out.

4786
03:11:35,130 --> 03:11:35,430
Wait.

4787
03:11:35,430 --> 03:11:36,750
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

4788
03:11:39,870 --> 03:11:40,430
Okay.

4789
03:11:42,930 --> 03:11:44,250
I didn't know.

4790
03:11:44,630 --> 03:11:45,370
I didn't know.

4791
03:11:50,630 --> 03:11:52,850
Yeah, it's only been 50 minutes, chat.

4792
03:11:54,430 --> 03:11:54,990
Okay.

4793
03:11:58,610 --> 03:11:59,730
Over here.

4794
03:12:03,050 --> 03:12:04,170
Over here?

4795
03:12:06,970 --> 03:12:08,730
Over here.

4796
03:12:11,430 --> 03:12:12,630
Missile?

4797
03:12:16,800 --> 03:12:18,000
Portal!

4798
03:12:18,360 --> 03:12:19,060
Portal!

4799
03:12:25,590 --> 03:12:26,790
Portal.

4800
03:12:32,470 --> 03:12:33,670
Yeah!

4801
03:12:33,910 --> 03:12:34,890
You see that?

4802
03:12:35,110 --> 03:12:36,070
Yeah!

4803
03:12:36,590 --> 03:12:37,790
Portal!

4804
03:12:38,390 --> 03:12:39,070
Okay.

4805
03:12:39,110 --> 03:12:39,710
Portal.

4806
03:12:39,770 --> 03:12:40,410
Portal.

4807
03:12:40,410 --> 03:12:41,430
Do you see that?

4808
03:12:42,330 --> 03:12:44,430
Is that a portal again?

4809
03:12:45,270 --> 03:12:45,630
Okay.

4810
03:12:45,830 --> 03:12:46,810
What's a portal?

4811
03:12:46,890 --> 03:12:47,430
Never heard of it.

4812
03:12:47,530 --> 03:12:48,950
I'm generally concerned for you.

4813
03:12:49,230 --> 03:12:50,530
What do you mean?

4814
03:12:51,270 --> 03:12:52,770
I'm trying my hardest.

4815
03:12:53,550 --> 03:12:54,270
Portal?

4816
03:13:18,500 --> 03:13:19,220
Cube?

4817
03:13:20,780 --> 03:13:21,500
Cube?

4818
03:13:23,320 --> 03:13:24,040
Cube...

4819
03:13:27,700 --> 03:13:28,420
Wait.

4820
03:13:28,660 --> 03:13:29,020
Wait.

4821
03:13:29,100 --> 03:13:29,480
Cube.

4822
03:13:29,600 --> 03:13:30,040
Cube.

4823
03:13:30,120 --> 03:13:30,720
Cube.

4824
03:13:30,720 --> 03:13:31,460
Cube.

4825
03:13:31,460 --> 03:13:31,780
Cube.

4826
03:13:34,380 --> 03:13:35,480
We got it.

4827
03:13:35,860 --> 03:13:36,660
We got cube.

4828
03:13:37,140 --> 03:13:37,500
Okay.

4829
03:13:37,540 --> 03:13:38,240
We don't need this.

4830
03:13:39,420 --> 03:13:40,480
We don't need this.

4831
03:13:44,340 --> 03:13:47,680
Like is it okay for you to be out in society in this state?

4832
03:13:47,920 --> 03:13:48,320
Look.

4833
03:13:48,380 --> 03:13:49,340
It's just portal.

4834
03:13:49,780 --> 03:13:50,740
It's just portal.

4835
03:13:50,900 --> 03:13:51,340
Portal...

4836
03:13:52,780 --> 03:13:54,160
Portal did this to me.

4837
03:13:54,900 --> 03:13:55,340
Portal?

4838
03:13:58,420 --> 03:13:59,240
It's just portal.

4839
03:13:59,580 --> 03:14:01,340
This is why I should not be doing...

4840
03:14:02,280 --> 03:14:03,880
This is why I don't do puzzle games chat.

4841
03:14:06,500 --> 03:14:08,660
This is my brain on puzzles.

4842
03:14:14,120 --> 03:14:14,640
Okay.

4843
03:14:15,660 --> 03:14:17,120
Portal is just an excuse.

4844
03:14:18,140 --> 03:14:19,020
What do you mean?

4845
03:14:21,460 --> 03:14:22,280
I swear.

4846
03:14:28,800 --> 03:14:29,740
Oh my god.

4847
03:14:30,100 --> 03:14:30,840
Oh my god.

4848
03:14:30,900 --> 03:14:31,360
Look how fat.

4849
03:14:32,280 --> 03:14:32,640
I'm speed-running.

4850
03:14:32,840 --> 03:14:34,160
I'm speed-running boys.

4851
03:14:34,780 --> 03:14:35,600
And girls.

4852
03:14:35,860 --> 03:14:36,980
I'm speed-running.

4853
03:14:37,120 --> 03:14:37,620
Oh my god.

4854
03:14:37,660 --> 03:14:38,160
That's so fast.

4855
03:14:39,200 --> 03:14:40,040
Oh my god.

4856
03:14:40,060 --> 03:14:40,660
I'm speed-running.

4857
03:14:42,360 --> 03:14:43,240
I hate this.

4858
03:14:43,280 --> 03:14:43,980
This sound...

4859
03:14:43,980 --> 03:14:45,000
is disgusting.

4860
03:14:45,920 --> 03:14:46,800
This is disgusting.

4861
03:14:47,880 --> 03:14:48,980
Wait, am I supposed to portal?

4862
03:14:49,100 --> 03:14:50,220
Oh, I'm supposed to portal out here.

4863
03:14:50,500 --> 03:14:52,220
I'm supposed to portal out here.

4864
03:14:53,500 --> 03:14:53,980
Turret?

4865
03:14:54,080 --> 03:14:54,460
Wait.

4866
03:14:54,600 --> 03:14:54,860
What?

4867
03:14:55,140 --> 03:14:55,620
Wait.

4868
03:14:55,680 --> 03:14:56,040
What?

4869
03:14:56,080 --> 03:14:56,440
Wait.

4870
03:14:59,180 --> 03:14:59,660
Wait.

4871
03:14:59,800 --> 03:15:00,280
Wait.

4872
03:15:00,340 --> 03:15:00,720
Wait.

4873
03:15:00,860 --> 03:15:01,340
No.

4874
03:15:01,720 --> 03:15:02,200
No.

4875
03:15:02,260 --> 03:15:02,260
No.

4876
03:15:02,260 --> 03:15:02,260
No.

4877
03:15:02,260 --> 03:15:02,260
No.

4878
03:15:02,260 --> 03:15:02,260
No.

4879
03:15:02,260 --> 03:15:02,260
No.

4880
03:15:02,280 --> 03:15:02,620
No!

4881
03:15:02,680 --> 03:15:03,900
No tur- no!

4882
03:15:04,940 --> 03:15:06,680
I don't have my cube!

4883
03:15:10,860 --> 03:15:12,840
Wait, wait how do I do this?

4884
03:15:25,600 --> 03:15:27,520
Okay, now I have my portal.

4885
03:15:27,760 --> 03:15:29,120
Now I have my cubes.

4886
03:15:29,900 --> 03:15:31,320
Now I have my cubes chat.

4887
03:15:45,650 --> 03:15:47,250
Now I'll use this guy.

4888
03:15:49,430 --> 03:15:51,290
That's not... okay.

4889
03:15:54,840 --> 03:15:55,280
Okay.

4890
03:15:56,320 --> 03:15:57,540
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

4891
03:15:57,920 --> 03:15:58,360
No!

4892
03:15:58,540 --> 03:15:58,840
Okay.

4893
03:15:59,060 --> 03:15:59,540
Okay, wait.

4894
03:16:01,620 --> 03:16:02,060
No!

4895
03:16:02,300 --> 03:16:03,200
Wait, wait, wait.

4896
03:16:03,360 --> 03:16:04,160
Can this block?

4897
03:16:04,280 --> 03:16:04,780
Can this block?

4898
03:16:05,140 --> 03:16:05,900
Can this block?

4899
03:16:08,160 --> 03:16:08,600
Okay.

4900
03:16:11,620 --> 03:16:12,900
Can I do this?

4901
03:16:22,960 --> 03:16:23,440
Okay.

4902
03:16:23,580 --> 03:16:24,440
Look at that.

4903
03:16:24,580 --> 03:16:25,420
Look at that.

4904
03:16:25,960 --> 03:16:26,820
Look at that.

4905
03:16:26,920 --> 03:16:27,780
I'm so smart.

4906
03:16:28,360 --> 03:16:29,340
What are you doing?

4907
03:16:29,560 --> 03:16:31,160
I-I- This is my cube now.

4908
03:16:31,640 --> 03:16:33,040
This is my cube.

4909
03:16:34,940 --> 03:16:37,700
I'm just using them to knock the others over.

4910
03:16:38,100 --> 03:16:38,640
Okay.

4911

Which one?

4912
03:16:40,120 --> 03:16:40,740
Who's next?

4913
03:16:40,840 --> 03:16:41,380
Who's next?

4914
03:16:42,260 --> 03:16:43,080
Who's next?

4915
03:16:44,400 --> 03:16:45,340
Wait, wait, wait.

4916
03:16:45,360 --> 03:16:45,800
I'm sorry.

4917
03:16:45,880 --> 03:16:46,160

03:16:52,960 --> 03:16:53,520
I'm sorry.

4924
03:16:54,080 --> 03:16:54,600
Wait.

4925
03:16:57,800 --> 03:16:59,460
I used this right in short.

4926
03:16:59,780 --> 03:17:01,960
The scary laugh is looking... Okay.

4927
03:17:03,280 --> 03:17:05,180
It's looking different than I remember.

4928
03:17:06,180 --> 03:17:06,700
Okay.

4929
03:17:09,280 --> 03:17:09,800
Okay.

4930
03:17:11,160 --> 03:17:11,680
No.

4931
03:17:11,760 --> 03:17:12,260
Wait, wait, wait.

4932
03:17:12,420 --> 03:17:12,720
Wait.

4933
03:17:12,760 --> 03:17:14,060
Please give me like five minutes.

4934
03:17:14,260 --> 03:17:15,700
Give me five minutes, drone.

4935
03:17:18,840 --> 03:17:19,360
Please.

4936
03:17:19,480 --> 03:17:19,860
Please.

4937
03:17:20,260 --> 03:17:21,080
Don't shoot me.

4938
03:17:21,240 --> 03:17:22,220
Don't shoot me.

4939
03:17:22,960 --> 03:17:23,100
Okay.

4940
03:17:23,100 --> 03:17:23,500
There we go.

4941
03:17:23,620 --> 03:17:24,280
There we go.

4942
03:17:24,360 --> 03:17:25,000
There we go.

4943
03:17:25,080 --> 03:17:25,740
We got this.

4944
03:17:25,980 --> 03:17:27,320
We got this.

4945
03:17:31,680 --> 03:17:33,000
We're very slowly.

4946
03:17:33,620 --> 03:17:35,500
I'm trying to kill a spider.

4947
03:17:37,040 --> 03:17:40,020
I'm just killing a spider real quick, chat.

4948
03:17:41,920 --> 03:17:44,060
I'm killing a spider with another spider.

4949
03:17:44,920 --> 03:17:45,400
Okay.

4950
03:17:46,100 --> 03:17:48,680
I don't know what happened but I'm having a good time.

4951
03:17:49,020 --> 03:17:49,360
Okay.

4952
03:17:51,560 --> 03:17:52,040
Okay.

4953
03:17:52,040 --> 03:17:52,560
Okay.

4954
03:17:55,140 --> 03:17:55,860
How do you get there?

4955
03:17:55,860 --> 03:17:56,100
Oh, there's another ops here.

4956
03:17:56,100 --> 03:17:57,820
How many more spiders do we have left?

4957
03:17:58,240 --> 03:17:58,840
All right.

4958
03:17:58,860 --> 03:17:59,280
Two more.

4959
03:17:59,300 --> 03:17:59,760
Two more.

4960
03:18:01,040 --> 03:18:01,700
Two more.

4961
03:18:01,780 --> 03:18:02,800
How do we get up there though?

4962
03:18:04,420 --> 03:18:05,640
What do you mean?

4963
03:18:05,800 --> 03:18:07,200
They're dying, aren't they?

4964
03:18:07,500 --> 03:18:08,420
They're dying.

4965
03:18:09,080 --> 03:18:10,140
That's all it matters.

4966
03:18:10,900 --> 03:18:15,500
It doesn't matter how we do this as long as this is happening.

4967
03:18:15,720 --> 03:18:16,420
Oh, I messed up.

4968
03:18:16,980 --> 03:18:17,460
Okay.

4969
03:18:17,900 --> 03:18:18,380
No.

4970
03:18:18,380 --> 03:18:19,300
As long as this happens... NO!

4971
03:18:19,600 --> 03:18:20,040
NO!

4972
03:18:20,260 --> 03:18:21,080
Where did it go?

4973
03:18:21,320 --> 03:18:22,420
No, my spider!

4974
03:18:22,700 --> 03:18:23,760
Okay, it's okay, I have a backup.

4975
03:18:24,120 --> 03:18:25,060
I have a backup.

4976
03:18:25,740 --> 03:18:26,800
I have a backup.

4977
03:18:30,600 --> 03:18:31,040
Wait,

4978
03:18:34,300 --> 03:18:35,200
I need another one.

4979
03:18:35,280 --> 03:18:35,840
I fucked up.

4980
03:18:36,400 --> 03:18:37,260
I fucked up.

4981
03:18:37,340 --> 03:18:38,400
I need to get another one.

4982
03:18:38,880 --> 03:18:41,900
Where is the... I need to find another spider.

4983
03:18:42,440 --> 03:18:42,880
Okay.

03:18:43,740 --> 03:18:45,280
We have a backup, backup.

4985
03:18:45,620 --> 03:18:46,280
Don't worry.

4986
03:18:46,520 --> 03:18:47,840
We have a backup, backup.

4987
03:18:50,460 --> 03:18:51,380
Okay, you know what?

4988
03:18:51,800 --> 03:18:54,120
I'm just... Okay, this is more easy.

4989
03:18:54,500 --> 03:18:55,360
This is easier.

4990
03:18:55,540 --> 03:18:56,220
Here we go.

4991
03:18:58,220 --> 03:19:02,100
Look at all... Look at all these... Look at all these turrets.

4992
03:19:03,100 --> 03:19:04,260
Okay, this is the new one.

4993
03:19:04,680 --> 03:19:05,980
Alright, where's the last one?

4994
03:19:06,320 --> 03:19:07,480
Last one's over there.

4995
03:19:08,360 --> 03:19:09,400
There you are.

4996
03:19:09,600 --> 03:19:09,860
Okay.

4997
03:19:10,040 --> 03:19:10,920
Target lost.

4998
03:19:11,220 --> 03:19:12,380
Look at the massacre.

4999
03:19:15,580 --> 03:19:15,980
Alright.

5000
03:19:15,980 --> 03:19:16,940
Alright, we got it.

We did it!

5003
03:19:19,320 --> 03:19:20,880
It's not... Oh, there's one more.

Okay.

5006
03:19:23,860 --> 03:19:25,600
Which one's... Which one's the new one?

5007
03:19:26,160 --> 03:19:28,640
Oh, okay, that... We're not using that, I guess.

5008
03:19:28,820 --> 03:19:29,100
Okay.

5009
03:19:30,040 --> 03:19:30,440
Orange.

5010
03:19:32,800 --> 03:19:33,200
Alright.

5011
03:19:53,720 --> 03:19:54,240
Okay.

5012
03:19:54,500 --> 03:19:55,340
Look at that.

5013
03:19:55,760 --> 03:19:56,700
We did it.

5014
03:19:58,540 --> 03:19:59,700
We did it.

5015
03:20:01,240 --> 03:20:02,280
Exterminate Doki.

5016
03:20:03,500 --> 03:20:04,020
Alright.

5017
03:20:05,620 --> 03:20:07,280
I'm gonna assume it's like this, right?

5018
03:20:08,740 --> 03:20:10,080
Where does this take me?

5019
03:20:11,800 --> 03:20:12,320
Oh!

5020
03:20:13,780 --> 03:20:14,640

03:20:22,100 --> 03:20:23,140
Wait, what?

5024
03:20:26,060 --> 03:20:27,100
I'm so confused.

5025
03:20:27,600 --> 03:20:28,160
Up.

5026
03:20:28,300 --> 03:20:28,840
Up.

5027
03:20:29,140 --> 03:20:29,740
Okay.

Okay, I got this.

03:20:53,160 --> 03:20:54,000
Okay, it's blue.

Blue.

5039
03:20:55,300 --> 03:20:55,740
Use blue.

5040
03:20:57,560 --> 03:20:58,800
And then... Blue!

5041
03:20:59,580 --> 03:21:01,280

We've not died once.

03:22:00,000 --> 03:22:01,580
We have not died not even once.

5087
03:22:02,060 --> 03:22:03,180

03:27:53,210 --> 03:27:55,270
I somehow fucked up up, guys.

5296
03:27:56,250 --> 03:27:56,890
Okay, okay.

5297
03:28:03,470 --> 03:28:03,930
Oh!

5298
03:28:04,390 --> 03:28:07,390
Okay, let me need water.

5299
03:28:07,690 --> 03:28:08,710
I need water.

5300
03:28:14,380 --> 03:28:15,400
Okay, okay, okay.

5301
03:28:17,080 --> 03:28:17,440
Okay.

5302
03:28:17,940 --> 03:28:18,880
Can we do another up?

5303
03:28:18,980 --> 03:28:19,840
We can do another up.

5304
03:28:21,600 --> 03:28:21,960
Okay.

5305
03:28:21,960 --> 03:28:22,580
Alright, up.

5306
03:28:24,100 --> 03:28:24,820
And then...

5307
03:28:24,820 --> 03:28:29,680
Okay, maybe this is not the right portal for up.

5308
03:28:29,860 --> 03:28:31,080
That's why I'm black for a hand!

5309
03:28:31,140 --> 03:28:32,240
Thank you so much for the follow!

5310
03:28:32,840 --> 03:28:34,040
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

5311
03:28:34,120 --> 03:28:35,520
I really do appreciate it!

5312
03:28:36,140 --> 03:28:37,020
Have a butt heart.

5313
03:28:37,140 --> 03:28:38,420
Thank you so much.

5314
03:28:38,480 --> 03:28:39,400
Have a butt heart.

5315
03:28:39,460 --> 03:28:40,380
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

5316
03:28:40,960 --> 03:28:42,220
Okay, okay, okay.

5317
03:28:42,500 --> 03:28:43,340
Maybe I need...

5318
03:28:43,740 --> 03:28:45,620
Um... maybe...

5319
03:28:46,740 --> 03:28:47,740
Up here?

5320
03:28:48,200 --> 03:28:49,220
Up here.

5321
03:28:50,540 --> 03:28:51,220
Yes!

5322
03:28:51,860 --> 03:28:52,140
Up!

5323
03:28:54,180 --> 03:28:55,780
Up, up, up.

5324
03:28:56,020 --> 03:28:56,860
Up, up, up.

5325
03:28:57,500 --> 03:28:57,840
Okay.

5326
03:29:00,640 --> 03:29:01,660
Now down.

5327
03:29:02,360 --> 03:29:04,540
Down, down, down, down.

5328
03:29:07,420 --> 03:29:09,680
I always think when there's no game...

5329
03:29:09,680 --> 03:29:11,820
It's hot right now on YouTube, I guess.

5330
03:29:12,120 --> 03:29:13,720
You could just do old games.

5331
03:29:13,740 --> 03:29:14,080
Old classics.

5332
03:29:18,160 --> 03:29:18,560
Okay.

5333
03:29:19,360 --> 03:29:20,560
Wait, where did I come from?

5334
03:29:20,680 --> 03:29:21,280
Oh, I came from here.

5335
03:29:21,680 --> 03:29:22,080
Right?

5336
03:29:22,300 --> 03:29:23,440
Yeah, yeah, cause there's door.

5337
03:29:24,000 --> 03:29:24,400
Door.

5338
03:29:34,500 --> 03:29:35,440
Look, I'm bunny hopping.

5339
03:29:36,000 --> 03:29:37,840
I don't think this is actually bunny hopping.

5340
03:29:38,300 --> 03:29:38,700
But...

5341
03:29:41,000 --> 03:29:41,400
Okay.

5342
03:29:42,880 --> 03:29:43,580
Oh shit!

5343
03:29:43,620 --> 03:29:44,240
Is this GLaDOS?

5344
03:29:45,200 --> 03:29:46,080
GLaDOS, is this you?

5345
03:29:46,620 --> 03:29:48,020
Look, are you proud of me?

5346
03:29:49,380 --> 03:29:51,420
Are you proud of me, GLaDOS?

5347
03:29:52,680 --> 03:29:53,740
I did it!

5348
03:29:54,960 --> 03:29:56,060
I went up!

5349
03:29:56,940 --> 03:29:58,020
I went up!

5350
03:29:58,780 --> 03:29:59,840
I went up!

5351
03:29:59,880 --> 03:30:00,200
Wait, more missiles?

5352
03:30:00,520 --> 03:30:01,940
Wait, is this a boss fight?

5353
03:30:02,380 --> 03:30:02,940
Wait...

5354
03:30:06,480 --> 03:30:07,040
Wait...

5355
03:30:07,040 --> 03:30:07,660
Oh no.

5356
03:30:07,820 --> 03:30:08,580
Oh no.

5357
03:30:08,760 --> 03:30:09,440
Oh no.

5358
03:30:09,580 --> 03:30:10,180
Oh no.

5359
03:30:10,380 --> 03:30:11,440
Wait, wait, wait.

5360
03:30:15,680 --> 03:30:17,280
Wait, is this Wheatley?

5361
03:30:18,740 --> 03:30:19,680
Who are you?

5362
03:30:19,860 --> 03:30:20,780
Are you Wheatley?

5363
03:30:20,840 --> 03:30:21,400
Wait, is this Wheatley?

5364
03:30:21,400 --> 03:30:21,400
Who are you?

5365
03:30:21,400 --> 03:30:21,400
Are you Wheatley?

5366
03:30:23,780 --> 03:30:25,940
Are you the blue guy?

5367
03:30:26,120 --> 03:30:27,220
Are you the blue guy?

5368
03:30:27,220 --> 03:30:28,240
Okay, but he's purple.

5369
03:30:28,740 --> 03:30:29,560
What am I taking?

5370
03:30:31,180 --> 03:30:31,600
Okay.

5371
03:30:35,000 --> 03:30:35,420
Okay.

5372
03:30:35,780 --> 03:30:36,780
Alright, alright.

5373
03:30:36,940 --> 03:30:37,480
What do I do?

5374
03:30:39,340 --> 03:30:43,360
I don't want to tell you your business, but if it were me, I'd leave that thing alone.

5375
03:30:43,960 --> 03:30:44,220
Oh.

5376
03:30:45,360 --> 03:30:45,820
What's it?

5377
03:30:47,300 --> 03:30:50,300
Do you think I'm trying to trick you with reverse psychology?

5378
03:30:50,320 --> 03:30:50,320
What's it?

5379
03:30:50,320 --> 03:30:50,640
Do you think I'm trying to trick you with reverse psychology?

5380
03:30:51,820 --> 03:30:52,300
Button!

5381
03:30:53,280 --> 03:30:53,760
Button!

5382
03:30:57,640 --> 03:30:58,400
Okay, fine.

5383
03:30:58,560 --> 03:30:59,680
Don't touch it.

5384
03:30:59,720 --> 03:30:59,920
Okay, fine.

5385
03:30:59,920 --> 03:30:59,920
Don't touch it.

5386
03:30:59,920 --> 03:31:01,700
Pick it up and just stop it for a minute.

5387
03:31:02,900 --> 03:31:03,740
Button, good.

5388
03:31:04,560 --> 03:31:05,520
Pick it up and just stop it for a minute.

5389
03:31:05,520 --> 03:31:06,120
Let's be honest.

5390
03:31:06,400 --> 03:31:08,620
Neither one of us knows what that thing does.

5391
03:31:08,680 --> 03:31:08,920
Oh, bird!

5392
03:31:09,280 --> 03:31:12,020
Just put it in the corner and I'll deal with it later.

5393
03:31:12,360 --> 03:31:13,420
Just put it in the corner and I'll deal with it later.

5394
03:31:15,920 --> 03:31:16,880
Okay, now...

5395
03:31:16,880 --> 03:31:18,980
Nothing is probably some kind of raw sewage container.

5396
03:31:18,980 --> 03:31:19,880
Button, good.

5397
03:31:20,280 --> 03:31:21,280
Mortal yes.

5398
03:31:23,080 --> 03:31:23,480
Alright.

5399
03:31:23,620 --> 03:31:24,020
Button.

5400
03:31:24,420 --> 03:31:24,820
Button.

5401
03:31:25,180 --> 03:31:27,920
Maybe you should marry that thing since you love it so much.

5402
03:31:28,160 --> 03:31:29,720
Do you want to marry it?

5403
03:31:29,740 --> 03:31:30,620
Well, I won't let you.

5404
03:31:30,800 --> 03:31:31,800
How does that feel?

5405
03:31:32,020 --> 03:31:32,100
Oh.

5406
03:31:32,580 --> 03:31:33,400
Alright, button.

5407
03:31:33,460 --> 03:31:33,940
Button, good.

5408
03:31:35,920 --> 03:31:37,040
Have I lied to you?

5409
03:31:37,160 --> 03:31:38,820
I mean, in this room?

5410
03:31:39,000 --> 03:31:40,420
Trust me, leave that thing alone.

5411
03:31:40,640 --> 03:31:41,240
Alright, alright, alright.

5412
03:31:41,360 --> 03:31:41,760
Come on.

5413
03:31:42,880 --> 03:31:43,280
No!

5414
03:31:43,980 --> 03:31:44,380
No!

5415
03:31:45,020 --> 03:31:47,740
Okay, I just need to line it up.

5416
03:31:47,800 --> 03:31:48,960
I am being serious now.

5417
03:31:49,180 --> 03:31:49,580
Okay.

5418
03:31:49,680 --> 03:31:50,880
That crazy thing is not part of any test.

5419
03:31:50,880 --> 03:31:51,400
Oh, bird!

5420
03:31:51,420 --> 03:31:51,760
Portal!

5421
03:31:53,240 --> 03:31:53,700
Okay.

5422
03:31:56,140 --> 03:31:56,600
Oh!

5423
03:31:57,600 --> 03:31:58,380
Button, good.

5424
03:31:58,440 --> 03:31:59,440
Then portal, good.

5425
03:32:00,500 --> 03:32:00,960
Portal.

5426
03:32:02,620 --> 03:32:03,540
And then...

5427
03:32:05,700 --> 03:32:07,260
Oh my gosh, I'm so smart.

5428
03:32:07,360 --> 03:32:07,800
I went...

5429
03:32:07,800 --> 03:32:08,840
I'm so smart.

5430
03:32:08,900 --> 03:32:09,580
Button, good.

5431
03:32:09,720 --> 03:32:10,720
And then portal, good.

5432
03:32:10,780 --> 03:32:11,740
And then bird, good.

5433
03:32:16,880 --> 03:32:17,340
There.

5434
03:32:19,440 --> 03:32:20,340
Oh my god.

5435
03:32:20,420 --> 03:32:21,160
I'm so...

5436
03:32:21,160 --> 03:32:23,060
Oh my god, I did it.

5437
03:32:23,120 --> 03:32:23,920
I did it.

5438
03:32:29,320 --> 03:32:30,860
It's negative right now.

5439
03:32:30,860 --> 03:32:31,840
It's a single person.

5440
03:32:37,420 --> 03:32:40,680
I figured out what that thing just incinerated.

5441
03:32:40,860 --> 03:32:41,100
I figured out what that thing just incinerated.

5442
03:32:41,100 --> 03:32:45,560
It was a morality core they installed after I flooded the enrichment center with energy and toxin.

5443
03:32:45,560 --> 03:32:45,600
It was a morality core they installed after I flooded the enrichment center with energy and toxin.

5444
03:32:45,600 --> 03:32:47,520
I'm back with one-hit-all-engine-bat.

5445
03:32:47,600 --> 03:32:48,700
Welcome back, Siri.

5446
03:32:49,100 --> 03:32:51,200
We're just doing the final...

5447
03:32:51,200 --> 03:32:52,180
We're just doing the final...

5448
03:32:52,180 --> 03:32:53,500
final boss fight.

5449
03:32:55,520 --> 03:32:56,940
I thought they were...

5450
03:32:56,940 --> 03:32:58,020
Wait, wait, wait.

5451
03:32:58,280 --> 03:32:59,280
Oh, oh.

5452
03:32:59,620 --> 03:33:00,540
Oh my god, you...

5453
03:33:01,260 --> 03:33:01,640
Wait.

5454
03:33:02,240 --> 03:33:02,620
Button.

5455
03:33:02,900 --> 03:33:03,280
No.

5456
03:33:03,380 --> 03:33:04,700
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

5457
03:33:05,200 --> 03:33:05,580
Wait.

5458
03:33:07,860 --> 03:33:08,240
Wait.

5459
03:33:08,860 --> 03:33:09,240
Wait.

5460
03:33:10,760 --> 03:33:11,560
How do I...

5461
03:33:12,110 --> 03:33:12,300
Okay.

5462
03:33:12,420 --> 03:33:12,740
Oh.

5463
03:33:12,900 --> 03:33:13,280
Yeah!

5464
03:33:13,940 --> 03:33:15,520
See now, thank you so much for the follow.

5465
03:33:15,600 --> 03:33:16,620
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

5466
03:33:16,780 --> 03:33:18,360
I really appreciate it.

5467
03:33:18,580 --> 03:33:19,680
Thank you so much.

5468
03:33:20,500 --> 03:33:20,880
What?

5469
03:33:22,260 --> 03:33:22,900
What?

5470
03:33:24,040 --> 03:33:24,680
Hey.

5471
03:33:25,300 --> 03:33:25,940
Hey.

5472
03:33:26,360 --> 03:33:27,000
Hey.

5473
03:33:27,340 --> 03:33:27,860
Hey.

5474
03:33:28,200 --> 03:33:28,680
Hey.

5475
03:33:31,420 --> 03:33:32,920
Oh, I missed.

5476
03:33:33,120 --> 03:33:33,680
I missed.

5477
03:33:33,820 --> 03:33:34,680
I missed.

5478
03:33:34,700 --> 03:33:36,040
I fucking missed.

5479
03:33:39,480 --> 03:33:40,120
Wait.

5480
03:33:40,400 --> 03:33:40,980
Wait.

5481
03:33:41,360 --> 03:33:42,000
Wait.

5482

This angle, this angle, this angle.

5970

This is good angle, right?

5971
03:47:24,320 --> 03:47:25,640
This is good angle, right?

5972
03:47:26,380 --> 03:47:27,980
This is not good angle.

5973
03:47:28,480 --> 03:47:28,940

5974
03:47:29,320 --> 03:47:30,640
Oh, this is good angle, right?

This is the angle that we're gonna use.

5993
03:47:57,340 --> 03:47:58,760
This is the angle that we're gonna use.

5994
03:47:59,060 --> 03:47:59,400

He... He fucking... He felt bad for me.

6045
03:49:14,820 --> 03:49:17,520
He felt bad for me that he went in the portal.

6046
03:49:18,120 --> 03:49:19,620
Wow, the flight power.

6047

Slow and... Oh, this is not angled right.

6054
03:49:28,780 --> 03:49:30,060
This is not angled right.

03:49:31,660 --> 03:49:32,200
I lied.

6060
03:49:32,300 --> 03:49:32,740
I lied.

6061
03:49:33,060 --> 03:49:34,060
Slow and... Blue.

6062
03:49:34,300 --> 03:49:34,660
Purple.

6063
03:49:34,860 --> 03:49:35,220
Orange.

6064
03:49:35,380 --> 03:49:35,680
Orange.

6065
03:49:35,840 --> 03:49:36,360
I got you!

6066
03:49:36,520 --> 03:49:36,800
Woo!

6067
03:49:36,980 --> 03:49:37,340
Woo!

6068
03:49:37,340 --> 03:49:37,600
Woo!

6069
03:49:37,600 --> 03:49:37,700
Oh!

6070
03:49:37,760 --> 03:49:37,960
Wait!

6071
03:49:38,100 --> 03:49:38,400
He thought.

6072
03:49:38,520 --> 03:49:39,020
He thought.

6073
03:49:39,180 --> 03:49:40,100
He thought.

6074
03:49:40,320 --> 03:49:40,920
Where are you?

6075
03:49:41,900 --> 03:49:42,260
Yes.

6076
03:49:46,620 --> 03:49:46,980
Yes.

6077
03:49:47,280 --> 03:49:47,640
Yes.

6078
03:49:48,780 --> 03:49:49,140
Yo.

6079
03:49:49,260 --> 03:49:49,360
Yo.

6080
03:49:49,440 --> 03:49:49,620
Yo.

6081
03:49:49,780 --> 03:49:49,860
Yo.

6082
03:49:50,840 --> 03:49:51,200
Yo.

6083
03:50:02,020 --> 03:50:02,600
This is it?

6084
03:50:02,680 --> 03:50:03,320
Can I do it?

6085
03:50:03,840 --> 03:50:04,500
What did I do?

6086
03:50:06,400 --> 03:50:07,000
Look at that.

6087
03:50:07,980 --> 03:50:08,700
First try.

6088
03:50:10,020 --> 03:50:10,740
First try.

6089
03:50:14,240 --> 03:50:14,960
First try.

6090
03:50:15,260 --> 03:50:16,080
Slow and steady.

6091
03:50:17,500 --> 03:50:18,120
We did it.

6092
03:50:18,720 --> 03:50:19,340
We did it.

6093
03:50:21,400 --> 03:50:22,040
We did it.

6094
03:50:22,340 --> 03:50:23,020
Zero deaths.

6095
03:50:24,060 --> 03:50:24,700
We did it.

6096
03:50:25,240 --> 03:50:25,820
We did it.

6097
03:50:26,220 --> 03:50:26,740
We did it.

6098
03:50:27,000 --> 03:50:27,660
We did it.

6099
03:50:27,660 --> 03:50:27,880
We did it.

6100
03:50:27,880 --> 03:50:28,880
We did it.

6101
03:50:30,660 --> 03:50:31,280
Oh.

6102
03:50:34,480 --> 03:50:35,100
Zero.

6103
03:50:35,480 --> 03:50:36,420
Zero deaths.

6104
03:50:37,370 --> 03:50:38,020
Zero deaths.

6105
03:50:47,770 --> 03:50:51,130
It only took us an hour to play and finish this game chat.

6106
03:50:52,410 --> 03:50:54,370
It only took us an hour.

6107
03:50:54,690 --> 03:50:55,810
Isn't that insane?

6108
03:50:56,530 --> 03:50:58,610
It only took my nightbot.

6109
03:50:59,510 --> 03:51:00,090
My nightbot is broken right now.

6110
03:51:00,230 --> 03:51:04,350
But it only took us an hour to finish Portal.

6111
03:51:04,810 --> 03:51:06,010
We're so gay.

6112
03:51:10,900 --> 03:51:14,540
It only took you an hour to beat you guys.

6113
03:51:17,560 --> 03:51:18,600
Oh my god.

6114
03:51:21,380 --> 03:51:22,340
We did it.

6115
03:51:25,320 --> 03:51:27,260
We drew a brawl record.

6116
03:51:31,920 --> 03:51:33,600
Oh my god.

6117
03:51:35,000 --> 03:51:35,760
Oh my god.

6118
03:51:36,640 --> 03:51:38,140
Oh we did it.

6119
03:51:39,460 --> 03:51:40,740
We did it chat.

6120
03:51:41,700 --> 03:51:42,480
We did it chat.

6121
03:51:42,480 --> 03:51:43,520
We're ready to join it.

6122
03:51:43,660 --> 03:51:44,920
We're ready to join it.

6123
03:51:45,500 --> 03:51:46,140
Dude.

6124
03:51:46,420 --> 03:51:48,200
I'm a fucking mess right now.

6125
03:51:48,460 --> 03:51:49,720
I'm a fucking mess.

6126
03:51:50,640 --> 03:51:51,700
There it is.

6127
03:51:52,220 --> 03:51:53,220
There's the cake.

6128
03:51:57,300 --> 03:51:59,100
Oh there it is.

6129
03:52:03,630 --> 03:52:04,830
We did it.

6130
03:52:06,050 --> 03:52:06,610
We did it.

6131
03:52:07,630 --> 03:52:08,510
Happy birthday.

6132
03:52:10,270 --> 03:52:11,050
Happy birthday.

6133
03:52:11,570 --> 03:52:11,810
Happy birthday.

6134
03:52:12,610 --> 03:52:13,510
I'm crying.

6135
03:52:13,630 --> 03:52:16,190
I actually have tears in my eyes.

6136
03:52:16,530 --> 03:52:18,610
I actually have tears in my eyes guys.

6137
03:52:19,530 --> 03:52:21,530
This took me so long.

6138
03:52:23,770 --> 03:52:25,970
This game took me so fucking long.

6139
03:52:26,290 --> 03:52:27,290
Oh my god.

6140
03:52:27,410 --> 03:52:30,750
I actually have tears running down right now.

6141
03:52:30,770 --> 03:52:31,270
Oh my god.

6142
03:52:31,290 --> 03:52:31,490
I actually have tears running down right now.

6143
03:52:40,510 --> 03:52:42,190
I actually have tears running down right now.

6144
03:52:42,190 --> 03:52:42,470
Oh my god.

6145
03:52:42,470 --> 03:52:43,890
My thirst's taking over your strength.

6146
03:52:44,210 --> 03:52:45,430
My thirst's taking over your strength.

6147
03:52:45,430 --> 03:52:49,010
Oh my god.

6148
03:52:49,730 --> 03:52:50,330
Oh my god.

6149
03:52:50,690 --> 03:52:52,290
I'm a fucking mess.

6150
03:52:55,150 --> 03:52:56,370
We did it.

6151
03:52:56,650 --> 03:52:57,770
We did it.

6152
03:52:57,770 --> 03:52:58,910
We did it!

6153
03:52:59,350 --> 03:53:02,650
What if I came first shape just because I got it?

6154
03:53:02,770 --> 03:53:03,930
Oh no, Christy!

6155
03:53:04,930 --> 03:53:06,090
Tears of happiness!

6156
03:53:07,470 --> 03:53:08,730
No more up!

6157
03:53:08,990 --> 03:53:10,190
No more up!

6158
03:53:11,270 --> 03:53:12,450
No more up!

6159
03:53:12,530 --> 03:53:13,470
No more portal!

6160
03:53:13,890 --> 03:53:16,310
I showed up on the wrong time.

6161
03:53:18,050 --> 03:53:23,410
No more portal!

6162
03:53:23,830 --> 03:53:24,970
No more up!

6163
03:53:24,970 --> 03:53:27,710
I feel brighter now that I've surprised you.

6164
03:53:27,830 --> 03:53:30,370
I can't believe it only took you 10 minutes.

6165
03:53:32,110 --> 03:53:36,390
This took me... Chat, this only took me 15 minutes to beat this.

6166
03:53:36,630 --> 03:53:37,370
That's crazy!

6167
03:53:38,210 --> 03:53:39,330
First try, ew.

6168
03:53:41,610 --> 03:53:43,390
She's so worse than me.

6169
03:53:46,230 --> 03:53:49,970
Oh my god, I'm wiping tears right now.

6170
03:53:50,330 --> 03:53:54,950
Chat, my head tracker is wiping tears out of my eyes right now.

6171
03:54:00,080 --> 03:54:01,680
Oh my god...

6172
03:54:01,680 --> 03:54:03,340
Oh my god...

6173
03:54:03,340 --> 03:54:03,820
We did it!

6174
03:54:03,980 --> 03:54:05,840
Oh my god, we did it!

6175
03:54:06,580 --> 03:54:10,900
My fucking... my fucking tracker's broken because I'm crying!

6176
03:54:13,680 --> 03:54:19,420
My model's broken because I'm crying tears of happiness right now.

6177
03:54:20,100 --> 03:54:22,920
Oh my god.

6178
03:54:23,660 --> 03:54:24,820
We did it!

6179
03:54:28,620 --> 03:54:30,700
Holy shit chat.

6180
03:54:32,780 --> 03:54:35,920
She didn't use the Ernie superior cube.

6181
03:54:37,640 --> 03:54:39,200
Oh my god I have to cry.

6182
03:54:39,360 --> 03:54:40,780
Oh my god now I have crying.

6183
03:54:41,540 --> 03:54:42,340
Where's my cry?

6184
03:54:51,760 --> 03:54:52,680
It's alive.

6185
03:54:57,640 --> 03:54:59,060
No Roy please.

6186
03:54:59,900 --> 03:55:00,540
Please.

6187
03:55:00,780 --> 03:55:02,400
I've been through so much.

6188
03:55:02,740 --> 03:55:04,720
I've been through so much guys.

6189
03:55:08,480 --> 03:55:10,180
I've been through so much chat.

6190
03:55:11,460 --> 03:55:12,560
We did it.

6191
03:55:18,040 --> 03:55:18,680
Oh.

6192
03:55:20,800 --> 03:55:22,580
Congratulations we did it.

6193
03:55:30,300 --> 03:55:31,400
Thank you.
