1
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,500
Okay, I'm good now.

2
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:21,800
Okay.

3
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,940
Hello, everybody.

4
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:23,620
Hello.

5
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:24,820
Sorry.

6
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,400
Sorry.

7
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,660
I'm okay for real now.

8
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,300
Okay.

9
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,440
I'm back.

10
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,020
For real.

11
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,180
I'm back for real.

12
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,400
I'm on my actual setup and everything.

13
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,280
So, like, everything is A-okay.

14
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,560
Not to Deadpool.

15
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,200
Thank you for the one.

16
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:42,760
Give the chip.

17
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,060
Thank you.

18
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:43,640
Thank you.

19
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,740
Mac, thank you for the five.

20
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,500
Give the chips.

21
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:46,960
Thank you.

22
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,620
Thank you.

23
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,280
All right.

24
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,520
Yes, I am back home.

25
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,340
As you can see, I sound a lot better.

26
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,420
I'm not, like, in a giant fucking echoey room this time.

27
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,460
Yeah, not... not... yeah.

28
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,340
It might still be a little scuffed, but, like, it's an improvement, you know?

29
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:10,000
Just... just... just a little bit of an improvement, which I will... I will take.

30
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,700
Um... um...

31
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,060
Um... so, yeah.

32
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,520
Sorry for being a little late.

33
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:34,140
I... I... I thought I timed it very perfectly, because it said I would arrive a lot earlier, and then I would be able to get home a lot earlier, and then my flight got delayed, and then it took fucking forever to, like, get off the goddamn plane, and then... okay,

34
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:46,060
it took forever for it to fly, and then it took forever for the plane to, like, fly... like, get off the plane, because people were, like, taking fucking forever, because I was at the very back, and then, um...

35
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:54,680
Because, okay, this is more so like a little bit of paranoia as someone that takes a lot of flights for once.

36
00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:01,620
I actually did economy because... I did economy because I was like, okay, you know what?

37
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,420
I need to start to save.

38
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,000
I need to save.

39
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,140
I shouldn't be, like, spending so much money.

40
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:17,460
I was like, all right, I should... with the concert being a lot of money, maybe I should, like, fly economy this time.

41
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:30,360
And so I decided to do economy, but I chose the seat at the very back because, um, statistically, uh... Okay, this is more like... this is a bit of, like, a little, like, doomer fact for you guys.

42
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,520
A little like, oh, now you're gonna be paranoid.

43
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,840
Now it's gonna be, like, a fucking underlying fear for you.

44
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,020
But if it's an underlying fear for me, I'm here to spread the fear to everyone.

45
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:46,300
But, like, statistically, more people survive if you're at the back of the plane.

46
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:54,220
So... So... So... So I was just like, all right, I'm gonna be at the very back.

47
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,280
If I'm gonna be in economy, I'll... I'll sit at the back.

48
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:00,660
Because statistically, I have more chance to survive.

49
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:11,100
I... So... Um... Um... Um... Uh... So, yeah.

50
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,100
So I was just, like, just, you know, I was just upping my statistics.

51
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,980
I was just trying to up my statistics.

52
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,260
I saw a lot.

53
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,380
I... I won't.

54
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:26,500
But... Um... Gus, thank you for the super chat.

55
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:26,820
Thank you.

56
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,320
Thank you.

57
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,200
I feel like I still hear a voice.

58
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:29,900
Next thing.

59
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,780
Thank you for the super chat.

60
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,120
Thank you.

61
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:31,720
Thank you.

62
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:32,900
Um... Anyway.

63
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,600
So... Uh... So, yeah.

64
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,200
So...

65
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,440
For some reason, the plane took fucking forever for it to unload.

66
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,060
And also took forever for...

67
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,700
Like... Um... To, like, leave the airport and everything.

68
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,720
So that's why I'm a little late.

69
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,000
I literally got home.

70
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,240
Use the bathroom.

71
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,120
Got home.

72
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,000
Turn on the PC.

73
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,320
Use the bathroom.

74
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,820
And then, like, got out back on the PC to set everything up.

75
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,620
Uh... Um... Uh... But, yeah.

76
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,780
So... I'm here now.

77
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,640
Uh... I sat next to a child.

78
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,140
Oh, God.

79
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:05,820
It's so hot.

80
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,260
Fuck.

81
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:06,560
Okay.

82
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,620
It's like it's... Oh, my God.

83
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,340
It's like it's, like, the summer or something.

84
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,260
Um... Anyway.

85
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,020
Um... I sat next to a child.

86
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,380
And, like... Okay.

87
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,460
So I always thought it was, like, a fucking meme.

88
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:18,820
You know?

89
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:19,980
Like... Okay.

90
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:28,520
So, like, you know how, like, children... You need, like, four different... Like, you have to have four different things playing at the same time on the screen to hold their attention?

91
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:29,720
So, like...

92
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,140
I thought that was a meme.

93
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:31,580
You know?

94
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,020
I thought that was just, like, an over-exaggeration.

95
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,780
But this child next to me... She had an iPad.

96
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,140
She was an iPad child.

97
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,520
And then her iPad... She was playing a game.

98
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,280
And then on the far... Like, the top right corner Was a fucking music video playing.

99
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,280
While she was... While she was playing her game.

100
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,000
And I was just like, why?

101
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:02,380
And, like, she was... She was doing, like, geometry dash While, like, a fucking music video was playing On the top right corner.

102
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:08,100
And then she was moving the music... The music video around Because she, like, needed a better view on stuff, too.

103
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,820
So she's like, oh, I'm moving on the top left.

104
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,260
And, like, you know, I just saw that.

105
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,960
I was like, oh my god, this is real.

106
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,140
Like, this...

107
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,000
That's real.

108
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,360
And then she was, like, not... She wasn't just playing Geometry Dash.

109
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,580
She was playing, like, other games.

110
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,960
I don't know what... I don't know.

111
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,100
It was... They were some weird-ass fucking games.

112
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,860
They were, like, obviously games for kids.

113
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,100
Anyway, so...

114
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,600
Um, so, okay.

115
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:37,100
What I thought was really funny was that... So, like, the dad was... The kid was like, can I sit on the aisle seat?

116
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,220
And then the dad was like, look, daddy needs his aisle seat.

117
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,160
It's the one thing I look forward to.

118
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,240
So depressing.

119
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,820
It was like, never have kids again.

120
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,760
I was just like, what the fuck?

121
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,460
Daddy needs his aisle seat.

122
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,260
Oh my god.

123
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,120
Oh, this is at the end of this.

124
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,540
I was like, bro, that's just...

125
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,080
That's too real.

126
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,940
That's actually too fucking real.

127
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:13,560
Don't take away the one thing I have left.

128
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,740
No, he has a...

129
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,600
No, the thing is...

130
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,360
Um, they have two kids.

131
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,700
Because the other kid is sitting with the mom.

132
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,680
Um, is sitting with the mom on the other side.

133
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,480
Because they're like, where do you want to...

134
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,940
Like, they're asking, which side do you want to sit?

135
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,660
And then, obviously, the iPad kid was like, I want to sit on the right side.

136
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,960
And not...

137
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,460
So, um...

138
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:40,860
So, yeah.

139
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,960
I was just like, Jesus fucking Christ.

140
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,360
Daddy needs his aisle seat.

141
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,120
Like, Jesus.

142
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,360
Like, do you really?

143
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,240
Do you?

144
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,820
Like, it's the little things in life that brings him joy.

145
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,280
And it's the fucking aisle seat at an airplane.

146
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,140
Um...

147
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,160
Yeah, bro.

148
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,240
I cannot overhear it.

149
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,540
Like, they were literally right next to me.

150
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,500
Like, I had to listen to it.

151
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,420
Um...

152
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:13,620
Um...

153
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,140
Sharko.

154
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,180
Thank you for the super chat.

155
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:15,540
Thank you.

156
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:15,980
Thank you.

157
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,300
I just sleep whenever I go on a plane.

158
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,460
If it crashes, I die in my sleep.

159
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,020
Thank you for the super chat.

160
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:21,300
Thank you.

161
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:21,840
Thank you.

162
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:22,600
CB.

163
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,560
Thank you for the super chat.

164
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:23,800
Thank you.

165
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,120
Thank you.

166
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,820
Statistically, flying is the safest way of transportation.

167
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:27,920
For pedestrians.

168
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,780
Thank you for the super chat.

169
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,000
Thank you.

170
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,300
Thank you.

171
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,420
Unless you're on a helicopter.

172
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,400
Um...

173
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,380
I heard, like, helicopter.

174
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,180
You have...

175
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,660
There's a higher percentage for...

176
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,880
You know, you can Uber helicopters?

177
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,700
That's fucking scary.

178
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,100
Like, there's...

179
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,680
Like, Uber allows you to, like...

180
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:56,700
Allows you to order helicopters For like, in like, I guess like in like populated city, like in like bigger, richer cities, I saw like on short someone was like, oh my god, there's an option to use a helicopter?

181
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,600
Like, I'm like, why?

182
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,580
Like, why would you ever?

183
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,260
Like, I don't know, I guess it's faster?

184
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,240
But then, I don't know, the fear of that shit is actually fucking crazy.

185
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,040
Like, sometimes it is cheaper.

186
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,520
Yeah, I'm just like, and it's sometimes, Jesus Christ, I don't know.

187
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,000
I was like, the fear of that.

188
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,280
Anyway, um, all right, let me recount.

189
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:28,060
Now that I have my actual setup, I'll talk about some stuff I talked about on the Twitch streams for those who weren't watching the Twitch streams.

190
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:40,740
Um, um, I, um, I went to a modern witchcraft store while I was traveling because I was like, ooh, there was, they were like, there was like, I don't know.

191
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,160
Okay, they're like, how do you know it was a modern witchcraft store?

192
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,440
Like, you just know.

193
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:58,140
Like, the, like, the window display was like, was like, okay, the window display, from what I remembered, was, was like, there was like, drag, like, figures of like, giant, a giant figure of a fucking dragon.

194
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:03,060
And then there was like, like, like, not poison, like, like, um, what are they called?

195
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:09,440
Like, those little herbs wrapped together, like, it's a little mini broom, but like, there's no stick on it.

196
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,580
Um, oh, I don't remember what it's called.

197
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,560
And then like, there's that shit around.

198
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:20,220
And there's like, you know, like the herbs and mushrooms and stuff like that, around the window display.

199
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,180
So I was like, and then there's candles too.

200
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,520
And then they had like, some of these like, incense stuff.

201
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,520
And then I was like, you know what?

202
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,220
Yeah, sage.

203
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:28,640
Yeah.

204
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,940
Yeah, sage.

205
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:33,700
Like, they had like, sage stuff on the, so I was like, oh, that's interesting.

206
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,980
So I like, went into like, the modern witchcraft store.

207
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,720
Because, you know, when will I ever see modern witchcraft?

208
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,860
I don't know.

209
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,900
When will I ever see a story that sells, like, modern witchcraft?

210
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,540
Like, I feel like that's just, like, out of nowhere.

211
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,400
Um, so I got really curious.

212
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,560
I was like, what the fuck?

213
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,760
Like, I was just like, what do they sell?

214
00:11:52,960 --> 00:12:07,320
Like, so, you know, I talked about it on Twitch, but they have, like, you know, like, the capitalism, the capitalism of tarot cards, where, like, there was, like, basically a bunch of fucking tarot cards that were based off of various TV shows and games and series,

215
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,280
and then other, like, you know, more...

216
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:19,300
I guess they have, like, other tarot cards that are, like, more so, like, more based on their own IP and stuff like that, but there were still, like, two shelves just dedicated to tarot cards.

217
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:23,320
And I'm like, Jesus fucking Christ, do I really need a Game of Thrones tarot card?

218
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:32,940
Like, doesn't that, like, sort of eliminate the, uh, the use of... Imagine getting your fucking fortune read with a Game of Thrones tarot card.

219
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,740
I was just...

220
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,780
Yes, it's very, very witchy.

221
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,080
Um, anyway...

222
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:43,940
Anyway...

223
00:12:43,940 --> 00:13:00,500
Um, there was that, and then there's, like, um, there's lots of fucking candles shaped like cats, and, uh, there was, like, um, and they had, like, a whole bookshelf of, like, modern witchcraft spells and, like, um, and, like, old spells.

224
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,820
Like, not just modern witchcraft spells, but, like, old spells.

225
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,660
I was so tempted to buy one.

226
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,180
I was like, man, this would be a funny, silly, uh, stream idea.

227
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,860
And then I looked at how much it cost, and I was like, not so funny anymore.

228
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,420
I was like, wait, I think I could just order this off of Amazon.

229
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,600
I'm pretty sure.

230
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:28,080
I was like, oh, man, I mean, like, I'm pretty sure I could just order this off of Amazon.

231
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:32,420
I was like, I don't need to buy this at a modern witchcraft store.

232
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:42,560
The thing is, I was just like, you know what, I'm gonna save my space on my suitcase.

233
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,520
If I actually want to do it, I'll just order it off of it.

234
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,980
Imagine buying, okay, let me see if I can actually find the book.

235
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:53,940
The book was, okay, um, modern witchcraft spells.

236
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,020
It was literally, oh, there you go, I found it.

237
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:59,620
It was actually the modern witchcraft spell book.

238
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,460
Your complete guide to crafting and casting spells.

239
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,060
Oh, yeah, there you go.

240
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,840
Oh, it was cheaper.

241
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,460
So, this was the book I found.

242
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,560
I was like, hmm.

243
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,880
I actually found the book.

244
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,860
So, here, I'll show you guys.

245
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,380
This was like, here, I'll just give you guys the title.

246
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,660
And then you can, let me save this image.

247
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,700
And then you guys can see.

248
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,460
Okay, here you go.

249
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:22,260
This was like, this was the title of it.

250
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,460
And this was literally the book.

251
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,100
And I, like, I was, I was just, I almost bought this book.

252
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,460
Because I was like, hmm.

253
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,460
I was just like, what if I, what if I use this on stream?

254
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,280
But yeah, and then I looked at how much it cost.

255
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,360
Look, it was like $22, like, Canadian.

256
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,460
Okay, it's $22 Canadian on Amazon.

257
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:55,600
But, like, I was just like, okay, if... This is... I was like, okay, I could clearly Amazon this.

258
00:14:55,780 --> 00:15:02,120
I... I could clearly... I could clearly Amazon this book.

259
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,540
But that's why I didn't buy it.

260
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,120
Because I was like, I'm not gonna waste my suitcase space for this fucking book.

261
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,060
Yeah, or I could just buy something off of... You're right.

262
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,220
I could just buy something off of Etsy and support my local witches, you know?

263
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,220
You're so right.

264
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:19,840
Wait, let me see.

265
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:20,500
Etsy.

266
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:23,580
Witchcraft.

267
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,120
Wait, is it true?

268
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,620
Wait, what can I even get?

269
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,620
Oh, there you go.

270
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:28,760
Oh, my God.

271
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:32,660
Supreme fuck around and find a voodoo doll.

272
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,900
Not a toy.

273
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:42,840
Hex revenge, voodoo, talisman, black magic, witchcraft, popping bones.

274
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,760
What the fuck?

275
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,200
Okay.

276
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,800
Oh, my God.

277
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,560
How many did this person sell?

278
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,720
Okay, I need to know who owns this one.

279
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,800
Okay, Mystic...

280
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,260
No way.

281
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,920
That's so much.

282
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,020
Oh, my God.

283
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,480
This guy has...

284
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,020
Oh, my God.

285
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,140
This guy... Oh, this guy has...

286
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,220
Sold a lot of voodoo dolls.

287
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:12,720
Fuck around and find a limited edition candle magic spell.

288
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,260
Hoodoo ritual.

289
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,900
Seven day wicka hex curse.

290
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,020
Revenge.

291
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:18,520
Hate.

292
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:19,460
Nasty.

293
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,180
Someone bought this.

294
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,540
They fucking sold 2,000 plus items.

295
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,120
Oh, my God.

296
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,980
Okay, I'll link you guys to the store and you guys can, like...

297
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,400
You guys can look at it yourself.

298
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,260
Like, I saw the voodoo dolls and I was like...

299
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,120
Oh, my God.

300
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:36,720
You're right.

301
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,180
Support your local witches instead of buying a $20...

302
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,500
Instead of buying a $20 book off Amazon.

303
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,200
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

304
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:46,560
Thank you.

00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,020
Thank you.

306
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,580
Are you sure that people who survived Playing Catchers were in the back?

307
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,100
Or is...

308
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,220
People were in the back in a situation where there was someone that...

309
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,880
Oh, thank you for the super chat.

310
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,120
Anton, thank you, thank you.

00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,740
Doc, thank you for the super chat.

Thank you, thankyou.

313
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,260
Why buy a book to cast spells when you're at...

314
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,480
You already steal our hearts?

315
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,480
Every stream will be allowed.

316
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,420
Thank you, super chat!

317
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,280
Thank you, thank you.

318
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,140
Uh, Anton, thank you for the super chat.

319
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,100
Thank you, thank you.

320
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,500
Uh, Doki, you should become a witch.

321
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,520
Oh my god.

322
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,280
I don't know.

323
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,920
Maybe I should be, like, the wholesaler for witch products.

324
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,840
Because clearly they're fucking making bank.

325
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:18,760
What is this?

326
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:27,840
Supreme, sacred, shaman, medicine, woman, ultimate, Native American protection, wealth, prosperity, business, work, success, love, voodoo doll.

328
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,620
Holy shit, guys.

329
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:39,960
If you buy it, it's 50... Oh my god, they originally were selling it for $1,300.

330
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,520
Holy fuck.

331
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,560
But guys, look, it's 50% off.

332
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,400
What a deal.

333
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:51,360
You can now have the supreme, sacred shaman for $650.

334
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,640
How many did they sold?

335
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:59,100
I mean, they sold a lot of... Oh my... Okay, they sold a lot of voodoo dolls.

336
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,220
Some of them are, like, sold out.

337
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:13,560
If I buy a tarot reading, can I request, like... Can I request, like, certain tarots?

338
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,840
Can I be, like, can you use a Game of Thrones tarot cards for me, please?

339
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,220
Like...

340
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,000
What... What a deal.

341
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,240
Is there... Oh, is there a review?

342
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,220
Let me see the review.

343
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,480
All right.

344
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,340
Amazing work.

345
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,800
Just what I was looking for.

346
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,580
My daughter was kidnapped and got her home now.

347
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,220
So, we are suing.

348
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,060
So, I bought candles to boost our case.

349
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,600
What the fuck are these?

350
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,600
What?

351
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:49,840
Okay.

352
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,540
Okay.

353
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,700
What the fuck?

354
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,000
Okay, wait.

355
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,820
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

356
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,740
Why is it always on Super Mario, man?

357
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:09,440
Why is it when I'm, like, on the multi-part series where I have the most interesting topics that I want to talk about?

358
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:15,780
It's always these fucking streams where I go, like, wild.

359
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,760
Look at this.

360
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:19,920
Holy fuck.

361
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:22,840
All right.

362
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,540
Look at this.

363
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,500
Amazing work.

364
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,800
Just what I was looking for.

365
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,660
My daughter was kidnapped and got home now.

366
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,940
So, we are suing.

367
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,900
So, I bought candles to boost our case.

368
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,720
Like, these reviews are...

369
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:45,620
These reviews are actually all over the place.

370
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,240
Oh, my.

371
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,660
I did not expect that.

372
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,260
Why is this?

373
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,400
Why is this?

374
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:53,620
Okay.

375
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,460
Item arrived faster than expected.

376
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,580
Lovely and great burn.

377
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,080
Repeat customer here.

378
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,020
And then, you know what they bought?

379
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:01,460
Okay.

380
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,120
Look at...

381
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:02,960
I like this review.

382
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,220
Because you can see what they bought.

383
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,240
And you're, like...

384
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,780
They smell...

385
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,320
They sound like a normal review.

386
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,880
Until you read what exactly the item is.

387
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,520
Excellent candles.

388
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,420
Smell lovely and burn great.

389
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,480
Repeat customer here.

390
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,800
Three candle ritual set kit.

391
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,480
Fuck around and find out.

392
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,000
Doom revenge.

393
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,680
Return to sender.

394
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,340
Voodoo hoodoo.

395
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,860
Black magic.

396
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,000
Dark art.

397
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,920
War death.

398
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,520
And then, like...

399
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,420
Great candles.

400
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,440
They smell lovely.

401
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,500
I'm definitely gonna buy my song again soon.

402
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,280
Sharko, thank you for the super chat.

403
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:43,780
Thank you.

404
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,300
Thank you.

405
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,400
VTuber tarot cards.

406
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,320
When...

407
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,480
Medi.

408
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,840
Thank you for the super chat.

409
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,120
Thank you.

410
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:51,600
Thank you.

411
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,760
The witch industry is insane.

412
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,360
Holy shit!

413
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,200
Oh my...

414
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:04,580
Oh my...

415
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,000
Um...

416
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,760
I like this review.

417
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,660
From...

418
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,240
Um...

419
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:10,860
From...

420
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,140
I like this review.

421
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,260
This review.

422
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,820
Fabulous!

423
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:17,880
Beautiful!

424
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,040
Great quality!

425
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,240
Voodoo doll!

426
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,740
Custom spell!

427
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,640
Not a toy!

428
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,460
Powerful poppin doll!

429
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:31,320
Not hoodoo wicca!

430
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,180
That's...

431
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:37,880
That's...

432
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,160
That's...

433
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:38,180
That's...

434
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:38,240
That's...

435
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:38,280
That's...

436
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:39,540
Terrifying!

437
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,480
That's the goddamn ash baby!

438
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,880
But hey...

439
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,320
Fabulous!

440
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:44,780
Beautiful!

441
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,820
And great quality!

442
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:46,780
Five stars!

443
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,260
Five stars!

444
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,240
Guys...

445
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:51,480
Guys...

446
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:51,700
Guys...

447
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,120
Clearly...

448
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,320
Am I in the wrong business?

449
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,280
I'm kidding...

450
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:54,800
Do I...

451
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,200
Go into the cap...

452
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,240
The capitalism of witch magic?

453
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,200
Um...

454
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,780
So people can support local witches right now on Etsy?

455
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,320
Um...

456
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:04,580
So...

457
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,120
No!

458
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,520
These are not the things I bought!

459
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:08,500
I...

460
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,180
I...

461
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,400
I was not...

462
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,320
I was just...

463
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,200
There were some things that were similar here...

464
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,180
But definitely I did not see the...

465
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:16,700
The...

466
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,520
The modern witchcraft store did not have an ash baby, unfortunately.

467
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,280
If there was an ash baby, I definitely would have bought one, I guess.

468
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,460
Maybe I would have bought the ash baby doll if they sold it at the store.

469
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,340
Um...

470
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,920
Oh my god!

471
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,400
Um...

472
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:40,960
Uh...

473
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,960
But yeah, that was interesting.

474
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:42,960
I thought...

475
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,320
I don't know...

476
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,120
That was...

477
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:44,500
Um...

478
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,800
A pretty fucking...

479
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,180
Wild tangent I went through.

480
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,240
Um...

481
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:49,640
Anyway!

482
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:50,700
Uh...

483
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,080
But yeah, that's basically...

484
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,500
I mean, there's other stuff I wanna...

485
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,000
I might wanna talk about later on.

486
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:55,460
But...

487
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,320
Yeah, I watched the...

488
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,760
You know, we did the Summer Game Fest.

489
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,560
So many games I'm really looking forward to are...

490
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,100
Um...

491
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:01,980
Like I said...

492
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,280
Um...

493
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,980
Sonic Racing Game.

494
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,520
Because there's Miku Hatsune.

495
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,220
Steve.

496
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,120
Because I'm looking forward to Miku Hatsune.

497
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,140
And Steve.

498
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,000
The Muppet Boxing.

499
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:16,940
And, um...

500
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,520
And the new Resident Evil game.

501
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,280
Um...

502
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,640
Jaxby, thank you for the super chat.

503
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,560
Thank you, thank you.

504
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,260
Oh, well...

505
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,320
I'm obviously...

506
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:24,760
For...

507
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,180
Oh my gosh.

508
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:25,440
Okay.

509
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,660
I need to show you guys the meme.

510
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,820
Thank you for reminding me.

511
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,880
I bookmarked, like...

512
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,060
When I...

513
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:29,920
I realized...

514
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,540
I've been, like, using bookmarks now.

515
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,060
Whenever I talk about...

516
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:33,580
Uh...

517
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,640
Also...

518
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,340
I...

519
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,060
I just remembered.

520
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,980
I said I'm looking forward to Sonic Racing.

521
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:38,860
But, like...

522
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,620
Do you guys know it's $90 Canadian?

523
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,180
Like...

524
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,720
Just for Hatsune.

525
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,280
Bro.

526
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,100
It's actually $90.

527
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,200
For...

528
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,800
Just because Hatsune Miku is in it.

529
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:52,660
It's...

530
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,640
It's...

531
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,200
90 Canadian dollars.

532
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,600
For Sonic Racing.

533
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,460
I'm like...

534
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,300
Are you fucking kidding me?

535
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,080
Holy shit.

536
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,080
Oh...

537
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,660
I don't think I can...

538
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,600
I don't think I can afford...

539
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,260
I don't think...

540
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,400
No, I can't afford it.

541
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:07,940
But, like...

542
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,400
There's a possibility...

543
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,960
That I might not buy the game.

544
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,020
But, anyway...

545
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,840
I love all the memes about the...

546
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,560
The new Marvel fighting game.

547
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,520
Because...

548
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:18,620
Okay.

549
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,860
This one was pretty funny.

550
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,040
Uh...

551
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,900
I love all the memes for it.

552
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:23,860
Because...

553
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:26,140
Because you just see Capcon on the corner.

554
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:34,760
Yeah.

555
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,240
Yeah...

556
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,140
Are you sure?

557
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,020
Yes.

558
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,300
And then there's this one.

559
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,160
The one where, like...

560
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,580
They're, like, doing the Jarvis...

561
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,320
Jarvis!

562
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,140
Frame data!

563
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,140
Please!

564
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,660
And then this one, too.

565
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,340
This one's one...

566
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,740
These are two of my favorite memes...

567
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,260
That came from the new fighting game.

568
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,100
It's like...

569
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,340
They're, like, doing the...

570
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:53,800
Jarvis!

571
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,880
What do I do?

572
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,420
And then it's all, like, fighting game analysis.

573
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,120
Uh...

574
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:00,420
Anyway.

575
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:00,780
Alright.

576
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:01,600
Enough.

577
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,000
Alright.

578
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,180
Enough tangenting around.

579
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:03,740
It's time...

580
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,340
Let's actually go play Super Mario, man.

581
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,160
Alright.

582
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,900
Let me boot up the game real quick, guys.

583
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,020
Um...

584
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,040
Mr. Broken Bond.

585
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:13,920
They give us a super chat.

586
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,820
Did you think you get a witch skin suit?

587
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,100
And...

588
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,400
A witch product?

589
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:18,240
Okay.

590
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,340
Clearly...

591
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,480
Clearly, I don't know.

592
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,140
It clearly seems like a very lucrative business.

593
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:27,080
Alright.

594
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,200
Mario, man.

595
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,180
Oh, wait.

596
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:30,940
I need to get my controller.

597
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:31,640
Alright.

598
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,400
Gonna sell some voodoo dolls shaped like dragoons.

599
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,260
And be like...

600
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,260
Is there a dragoon you wanna curse?

601
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,860
Make an ash...

602
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,980
Ash baby dragoon doll.

603
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,180
Alright.

604
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:48,860
Let's see.

605
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,000
Oh my god.

606
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,320
There's two of you guys now.

607
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:56,540
There we go.

608
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:57,320
Alright.

609
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,500
Getting my controller.

610
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:58,900
Go for later.

611
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,820
Go for later.

612
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:09,160
Alright.

613
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,020
Let's go.

614
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,920
Back to where it all began.

615
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,800
Super Mario Man.

616
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,740
With my actual save file.

617
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,260
Where am I?

618
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,380
I actually forgot.

619
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,600
Where is this place?

620
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,280
Oh, wait.

621
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:24,620
I remember.

622
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:25,220
It's...

623
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,660
It's the city.

624
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,180
Oh, it's New Doink City.

625
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:31,860
Okay.

626
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,660
Oh, we get that road to good use.

627
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:35,280
Oh, yeah.

628
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,460
They gave me a new...

629
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,160
They gave me a new ride.

630
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,540
My big bro and I love coming to the Metro Kingdom when we have enough saved up.

631
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,420
Sometimes we get a little overwhelmed with all the lights and noises.

632
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:50,300
So, we always visit a park with his headphones to relax.

633
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,860
He really likes watching these Goombas play.

634
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,480
Oh, he's a little shy guy.

635
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:56,420
Okay.

636
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,220
Mary Pauline does so much for the city.

637
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,520
She manages battles, things, and races.

638
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:05,700
Ah.

639
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,800
I do...

640
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,260
What do I do to go on a date with her?

641
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,900
Ask her out.

642
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,060
I don't have anything to give her.

643
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,600
Wait, Mario.

644
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,780
Mario, you have a heart scare?

645
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,200
You do?

646
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,940
Yeah, please have it.

647
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:22,620
All right.

648
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:26,300
Let's let the short king woo Pauline, my ex-girlfriend.

649
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,520
Thank you, Mario.

650
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,240
That's crazy.

651
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:35,740
Like, asking the ex how to fucking be with, like, Pauline.

652
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,000
You won't regret this.

653
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:38,580
All right.

654
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:38,900
Goodbye.

655
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:41,660
Welcome.

656
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,120
Welcome.

657
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,220
Is this your first time in New Doink City?

658
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,980
That's a city hall.

659
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,680
There's usually something fun here.

660
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:48,680
All right.

661
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,300
This is a big...

662
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:50,400
Wait.

663
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,440
This city seems to be bigger than, um...

664
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,000
What was it?

665
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,920
What was that other...

666
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,240
The Wario's area?

667
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,660
What's that?

668
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,760
What's an old toad like myself doing at work in a laboratory?

669
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,080
I'll have you know.

670
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,440
Elvin and I go way back.

671
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:09,740
I'm here to help my old friend whenever he has a need to.

672
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,720
Professor E-Gag really puts us through the works.

673
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,520
At least the work is fulfilling though.

674
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,480
Oh, he lives here?

675
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,500
Oh, this is E-Gag's place.

676
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,640
I thought he'd, like, be at Toad City.

677
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,520
Honestly, I don't even know why they hired me to keep watching at this place.

678
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,340
That game developer back there could wipe the floor with everyone in the world.

679
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,740
Well, that team of theirs.

680
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,600
I wonder why they didn't compete in the Gap Challenge.

681
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:39,940
Me and that toad guard over there are old buddies despite appearances.

682
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,000
We protected some high-profile targets in our day.

683
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:46,400
Professor E-Gag hardly even needs it.

684
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,780
He's strong, I tell you.

685
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,120
Oh, wait.

686
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,080
He's a strong trainer?

687
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,620
I mean, to be fair.

688
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:54,860
Like, he can capture any Mon that he wants.

689
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,640
We here at Gag Science are researching the science of Cap Battles.

690
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,600
As a result, the professor has become quite the expert.

691
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,760
I want that blonde girl that works near him.

692
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,760
They're really scary to go up against.

693
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,140
Is he actually that strong?

694
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,000
Does he, like, max level up his mons?

695
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,340
Hmm.

696
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,690
Wait, is that Alpha Red?

697
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:23,510
Here, let's see the professor?

698
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:26,590
Or that quirky group of developers in the corner?

699
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:27,910
Oh, yeah, that's the dev team.

700
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:32,430
Being an intern for the professor sure is hard work.

701
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:35,070
Okay, I recognize the devs there.

702
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,550
Hit it, I'm Kobe.

703
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:37,970
Oh, skip a, skip a.

704
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:42,470
How much we battle?

705
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,050
How about we battle once you become...

706
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:45,630
Oh, this is like a bonus area.

707
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,370
Wait, what's this?

708
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:47,350
Bing, bing.

709
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:49,470
Mario.

710
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:51,550
Mario.

711
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:53,290
Mario.

712
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:56,190
Oh, I see you finally reached my alarm.

713
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:57,830
Wonderfully done.

714
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:58,670
Yes, yes.

715
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:03,110
Here, let me give you a little something as a reward for making it this far.

716
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:03,710
Yay!

717
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:05,250
Free stuff.

718
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,350
Oh my god, it's John Mario, man.

719
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:10,830
That training module contains a move, boss wipe.

720
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:14,010
It should help you immensely when filling out the rest of your tile decks.

721
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:15,430
Speaking of...

722
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,370
You've been doing that, haven't you?

723
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,710
It's a great reward for you.

724
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:19,810
You can fill it out completely.

725
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:22,430
Oh, we're definitely gonna do that.

726
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:22,970
Oh, yeah.

727
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,730
I heard that like with the new Switch too.

728
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,250
Um, it like...

729
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:28,870
It like revolutionized shiny hunting.

730
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,370
Because apparently it's like so fast to shiny hunt now.

731
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:33,090
What's that?

732
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:33,650
Sorry.

733
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:34,450
Can't talk right now.

734
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,470
But I'll be here when the phone rings.

735
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:41,710
I got an email that Tastare in on Prince needs my help to hide his gold.

736
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,250
Can you believe it?

737
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:45,010
Yeah, apparently it like...

738
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,190
The newest rec world record...

739
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:51,610
It like beat the old world record for shiny hunting by like 25 minutes or something.

740
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:56,670
Um, yeah, well...

741
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:58,990
We'll get a job and stuff eventually.

742
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,190
For now, we're just crashing on the couch.

743
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:03,570
Ain't bothering anyone or nothing, I guess.

744
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:06,290
Me and my sister are kind of just chilling right now.

745
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:06,690
You know?

746
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:09,390
Big city life is too tough for us.

747
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,210
I can never live outside of a city.

748
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,850
I think I'd like die.

749
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,730
You'll find me in the woods.

750
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,990
This is ridiculous.

751
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:22,730
The owner here wants to work so badly that my desk is on the first floor.

752
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,870
It doesn't even consider working conditions.

753
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:25,830
No, you don't understand.

754
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,050
If I get...

755
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:29,270
If I get internet speed below...

756
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:31,750
Below 500 for five...

757
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,090
Below 500?

758
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:34,210
I...

759
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:35,390
You don't understand.

760
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:36,710
That you can never go back.

761
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:39,990
Guys, I've had fiber for way too long.

762
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:43,470
I cannot go back to what it once was.

763
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:44,690
You cannot...

764
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,230
I've lived...

765
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:49,950
I live with fiber...

766
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,490
And everything convenient around me.

767
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:54,690
Of everything being like...

768
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:56,750
Five to ten minutes around me.

769
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:58,070
For too long.

770
00:31:58,610 --> 00:31:59,650
I have a friend...

771
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:00,610
That lives...

772
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:02,350
In the middle of fucking nowhere.

773
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:04,070
And then like...

774
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:04,810
And then like...

775
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:05,630
He was like...

776
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:06,190
Yeah...

777
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,590
Food sometimes take like...

778
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,330
30...

779
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:10,670
Like sometimes take like...

780
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:12,570
40 to 50 minutes to get here.

781
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:14,110
And I'm like...

782
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:14,530
What?

783
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:18,190
Oh, so you order from like...

784
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,510
Downtown or something, right?

785
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:20,870
And then he was like...

786
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:22,610
No, it's like the closest...

787
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:24,230
Like restaurant near me.

788
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,810
I'm like...

789
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,590
The closest?

790
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:28,770
Wait...

791
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:29,190
And I'm like...

792
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,130
What about fast food?

793
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,570
What about like McDonald's?

794
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:32,370
Oh yeah...

795
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:34,830
That's like a 25 minute drive away.

796
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,070
And I'm like...

797
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:36,210
What?

798
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,510
What do you mean?

799
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,310
A 25...

800
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,650
Oh my god...

801
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:45,570
Not too bad.

802
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:46,730
You see here...

803
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:47,230
You see...

804
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:49,190
I live in the city.

805
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:51,630
The closest McDonald's near me...

806
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,550
I don't know what the closest McDonald's near me...

807
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:56,030
But I feel like the closest McDonald's near me...

808
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,390
Would be like five minutes.

809
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:59,550
Like a five minute drive.

810
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,790
Not a 25 minute...

811
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:04,710
You want five minute drive or fast food isn't terrible?

812
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:05,370
You see...

813
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:05,970
You don't know.

814
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:06,990
You don't know.

815
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,750
You might not live in the city.

816
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:09,930
I live in the city.

817
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,490
That's pretty fucking bad.

818
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:12,230
That's...

819
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:16,450
That's really...

820
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:18,010
That's really fucking bad.

821
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:20,710
I have everything conveniently located around me.

822
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,330
I don't live in the suburbs.

823
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:31,410
But everything is like conveniently around me.

824
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:34,030
Um...

825
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:34,630
Oh...

826
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:36,530
I'm the owner of this here building.

827
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:37,470
Uh...

828
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:39,170
We use it as an office space mainly.

829
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:40,510
And I must say...

830
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:42,650
We're very profitable as of late.

831
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:44,470
I knew putting even more desks...

832
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:46,670
And cramping the employees closer together...

833
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:47,930
Would help build team synergy.

834
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:50,030
Why are you looking at me like that?

835
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:52,730
Alright.

836
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:54,130
Ugh...

837
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:55,370
I hate this job!

838
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:56,790
Why should I have to keep...

839
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:58,230
These poor employees in line?

840
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:00,370
I'm just even in a manager position.

841
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:02,510
All I do is keep watch.

842
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:07,570
The owner here has some interesting ideas about team synergy.

843
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:10,050
For one, he makes us all dress up the same.

844
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,810
I don't even need these glasses.

845
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:12,510
Oh yes.

846
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,590
When they all look the same.

847
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,590
So you don't have to have like actual...

848
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:15,990
Like...

849
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:16,870
You don't have to put...

850
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:17,970
Like humanize them.

851
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,250
If they all look the same.

852
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:23,370
Also, I haven't had McDonald's in fucking years though.

853
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:23,910
To be fair.

854
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:24,910
Um...

855
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:25,490
Or...

856
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:26,330
Hmm...

857
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,970
Actually, maybe a year ago?

858
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:30,750
The only time I ever want to have McDonald's...

859
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:31,770
Is their chicken nuggies.

860
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:34,270
If I ever have like a chicken nuggie craving.

861
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:35,290
Quickly!

862
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:35,810
Take this!

863
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:36,730
Oh nice.

864
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:37,390
I got a koi.

865
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,310
I also haven't had like...

866
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:43,530
Soda in a while.

867
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:44,970
Or like...

868
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:45,430
Soft...

869
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:45,950
Um...

870
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:46,470
Soft drinks.

871
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,050
I'm sick of it!

872
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:49,750
I don't want the responsibility!

873
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:50,410
Oh wait.

874
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:52,470
Isn't amulet calling means I get more money?

875
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:53,910
Okay.

876
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:54,510
What is it?

877
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:55,190
Doubles money.

878
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:55,630
Oh yeah.

879
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:55,970
Okay.

880
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:56,370
Give.

881
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,050
What does dad have?

882
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,090
I don't remember why I keep dad.

883
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:02,250
Alright.

884
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:02,770
What do you have?

885
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:03,450
What are you holding?

886
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:06,970
Uh...

887
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:10,130
What does the shell belt do again?

888
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:10,790
Guys?

889
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:15,370
Oh.

890
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:15,750
What?

891
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:16,950
I wasn't snacking off.

892
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:17,350
I swear!

893
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:18,790
I can't take this anymore!

894
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,090
Don't do it!

895
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:20,750
Don't jump!

896
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:21,610
Oh my god!

897
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:22,810
He was going to the window!

898
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:24,070
Holy fuck!

899
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:27,950
Oh, he doesn't need that.

900
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,010
Money's more important.

901
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:30,770
Oh my god.

902
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:32,990
He cleared.

903
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:36,310
He was actually going towards the fucking...

904
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:37,510
That's crazy.

905
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:39,690
Don't tell Nintendo.

906
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,550
Oh man!

907
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:42,950
I really done it now!

908
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:46,330
There's a window right here!

909
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:50,690
Do a flip!

910
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:51,390
Oh...

911
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:53,530
Oh...

912
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:54,250
Silly...

913
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,490
Depression's not real!

914
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:57,690
So boring!

915
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:00,350
If our boss was in the cap challenge...

916
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:02,890
His type would definitely be the boring type!

917
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:06,890
I don't know why everyone here is complaining so much!

918
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,970
I got hired easily and barely have to work!

919
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:10,790
Surely everyone has the same...

920
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:12,650
Fuck here!

921
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,210
PTSD right there!

922
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:18,450
Hey there!

923
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:19,150
On your break?

924
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:21,090
Better head upstairs ASAP!

925
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:22,830
Then, so you can make most of your time!

926
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,570
Don't let the boss see you on the way up!

927
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:26,270
Alright.

928
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:27,510
Oh wait!

929
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:27,850
Oh!

930
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,050
This is a secret exit!

931
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:30,550
Oh where?

932
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:33,250
Bro.

933
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:37,250
I mean, if that boss treats me right...

934
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:39,810
Surely everyone has the same experience!

935
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:40,610
Alright!

936
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:41,630
Thank you for the super chat!

937
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:42,010
Thank you!

938
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:42,550
Thank you!

939
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:44,270
Money more important than elf?

940
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:44,910
Who are you?

941
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:45,810
The government?

942
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:46,810
Woo!

943
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:47,770
Finally!

944
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:50,130
A peaceful respite from what bladder...

945
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:51,570
From that bladdering boss of mine!

946
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:52,150
Oh yeah!

947
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:53,470
That reminded me!

948
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:54,130
I'm gonna...

949
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:56,470
I'm gonna do Hunger Games, the emotes...

950
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:56,950
After...

951
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:57,930
At the end of the stream!

952
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,250
So we're gonna say goodbye to two emotes!

953
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:01,470
For those who don't know...

954
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,650
The member goons...

955
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:04,370
We have two new emotes!

956
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:05,150
But like...

957
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:05,390
Don't worry!

958
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,550
These emotes will be moved...

959
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:07,650
Will still be available on Twitch!

960
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:08,570
Because I have a lot of...

961
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:10,830
Twitch gives you a lot of emote slots!

962
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,510
But on YouTube...

963
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,810
There's like a maximum...

964
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:15,310
A very small maximum amount!

965
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:18,210
And your member goons have voted out...

966
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,850
Two emotes off the island!

967
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:22,870
So...

968
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:25,190
So like...

969
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:27,470
Sorry...

970
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:28,930
My brain actually died there...

971
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:29,370
I'm so...

972
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:34,050
I actually like...

973
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:36,430
Short-circuited a little bit...

974
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:36,790
But yeah...

975
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:37,210
So...

976
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:38,570
Say goodbye to the...

977
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:39,090
Two em...

978
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,010
To whatever the two emotes are...

979
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:42,670
Before the end of the stream...

980
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,690
You see those two twins downstairs?

981
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,090
I hear they're related to the owner of some way!

982
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:49,030
Because of that...

983
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:51,070
They're allowed to stay here while they're in between jobs!

984
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:51,930
Meanwhile...

985
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:53,790
All salary workers gotta put up with them...

986
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:54,910
While going about a job!

987
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:56,230
Honestly...

988
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,250
I'm really starting to get sick of them!

989
00:37:59,390 --> 00:37:59,830
Uh...

990
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:00,330
Anton...

991
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:01,270
Thank you for the super chat...

992
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:01,710
Thank you...

993
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:02,350
Thank you...

994
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:02,690
Uh...

995
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:02,970
Doki...

996
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:04,390
Can we have 7TV on Twitch chat?

997
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:05,430
Yeah, we can!

998
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:05,910
We just...

999
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:07,310
I just need someone else to handle it!

1000
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:08,590
I could like delegate that!

1001
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,650
I'm just lazy!

1002
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:12,650
When it comes to adding new stuff!

1003
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:14,770
Lord Crowe says they give a super chat!

1004
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:15,030
Thank you!

1005
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:15,450
Thank you!

1006
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:17,290
She blasts the city's dragoons!

1007
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:23,490
The owner of this building hired me to predict the future of his company!

1008
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,210
Quite honestly...

1009
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:26,210
It's not looking good!

1010
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:27,490
But I didn't tell him that!

1011
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:29,290
He doesn't deserve my services!

1012
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:30,270
Alas!

1013
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:31,350
And all that!

1014
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:32,270
What's that mean?

1015
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:34,090
All landlords are shrooms!

1016
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:35,930
But you don't hear that from me!

1017
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:38,570
Alright...

1018
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:42,010
Let's head off!

1019
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:42,550
Woo!

1020
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:44,230
Alright, where do we go?

1021
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:45,570
What was this?

1022
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:47,530
Oh, these were the store in the market!

1023
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:49,250
No more sandy desert!

1024
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,290
Hello, concrete jungle!

1025
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:52,910
Oh, can I get up there?

1026
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,170
No, okay.

1027
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:55,810
Must be a way to get up there!

1028
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:57,250
There's an item just sitting there!

1029
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,450
Just sitting there!

1030
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:00,990
Like I could grab it!

1031
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:05,050
I have friends tell me that I'm not gonna get my wings unless I take a leap of faith!

1032
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,830
I told him, No, thank you!

1033
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:08,130
I'd rather stay on the ground!

1034
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:11,730
Okay, want to go to my secret spot?

1035
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:12,970
Okay, Cookie Koopa!

1036
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:14,650
Oh, it's...

1037
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:15,510
Oh, what the fuck?

1038
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:16,630
Oh shit!

1039
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:17,730
No, that's how they got it!

1040
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:19,470
Lord Bowser!

1041
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:20,110
Please!

1042
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:21,330
Save me!

1043
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:23,850
We're not done!

1044
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:25,690
Oh my god, there's a toad gang!

1045
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:27,270
The toad biker gang!

1046
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:28,950
Guys!

1047
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:30,910
I found a blue shell!

1048
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,070
Oh...

1049
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:40,230
Oh yeah, the new Switch 2 and Mario Kart World came out.

1050
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:41,070
You know what's funny?

1051
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:43,090
They didn't fix the drift prop.

1052
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:43,670
They didn't fix the drift prop.

1053
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:44,590
They...

1054
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,350
They kept...

1055
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:45,950
I...

1056
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,050
I heard that...

1057
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:53,350
I heard that the Switch 2 Joy-Cons are still drifting because they didn't fix anything.

1058
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:55,210
And then like...

1059
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:55,770
Um...

1060
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:58,950
And then like one of my friends was complaining about it on Discord.

1061
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:01,030
I was like, are you fucking stupid?

1062
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,810
Of course they're not gonna fix it.

1063
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:04,030
Nobody cares.

1064
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:04,810
Like...

1065
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:05,710
Like...

1066
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:06,130
Like...

1067
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:09,270
That has been a problem for years now.

1068
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:10,350
And you know what people do?

1069
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:12,610
They just buy new Joy-Cons.

1070
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:18,330
Nobody will stop them.

1071
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:29,490
Why fix the thing when they're earning more money to buying new Joy-Cons?

1072
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:34,790
Alright, let's see.

1073
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:37,410
The Koopa Troop owns this building.

1074
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:41,090
And when I say the Troop owns it, we got more share here than Lord Bowser.

1075
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:46,690
A lot of us minions got together in Main Street and decided to purchase this building with our purple coins.

1076
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,370
Thankfully, we got in before that market crashed.

1077
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:52,110
Oh my god, are our purple coins like Bitcoin?

1078
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:55,510
Mario, you're just in time to join us for a party!

1079
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:56,110
What?

1080
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:57,790
You thought we'd kick you up?

1081
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:00,490
Nah, we don't actually mind you all that much.

1082
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,290
Nothing ever changes.

1083
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:06,270
Letters don't know it, but we're actually a mess of debt.

1084
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:10,150
Turns out purple coins weren't the most reliable method of purchasing this land.

1085
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:13,130
And now the city is after us on fraud charges.

1086
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:16,690
Whoops, I may or may not have caused a market crash.

1087
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:23,030
We took an insurance policy on this building, but it turns out it doesn't end up being very valid when you work with purple coins.

1088
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:24,610
Here, you can just have it.

1089
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:25,990
You're doing us a favor.

1090
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:28,170
Obtain the blunder policy?

1091
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:29,310
Wait, what's that?

1092
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:31,390
I got insurance now?

1093
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:34,830
Oh.

1094
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:36,830
Raises speed?

1095
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:38,090
Is that what insurance does?

1096
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,410
What the fuck?

1097
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,970
It raises my speed.

1098
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:46,930
With the power of insurance.

1099
00:41:55,650 --> 00:42:00,110
We got way too many boxes in this building.

1100
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:03,950
I doubt anyone would realize if I just took some for myself.

1101
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:07,430
A little toilet paper here or there.

1102
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:09,410
How would they know?

1103
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:12,190
There's so much toilet paper.

1104
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:12,370
There's so much toilet paper here.

1105
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:16,190
Hey, man!

1106
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:16,910
What's up?

1107
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:17,630
Me?

1108
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:19,690
I'm just bobbing, I guess.

1109
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:21,210
Wanna join me?

1110
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:21,690
Sure.

1111
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:22,530
Cool!

1112
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:24,270
Make yourself comfortable.

1113
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:25,770
Alright.

1114
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:30,570
Sometimes, it's just nice to take a...

1115
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:31,790
Oh, it's this song!

1116
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:48,470
I'm taking the sights, y'all know!

1117
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,570
Everyone around us is so busy.

1118
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:55,550
Always in a rush, don't you think they should slow it down?

1119
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:59,150
That's what I'm trying to do, at least.

1120
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:06,530
Recently, I've been so overwhelmed by trying to finish an important project of mine.

1121
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:13,150
It means everything to me, and I want to see it to fruition no matter what.

1122
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:18,830
But in that pursuit, I burned myself out pretty bad.

1123
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:22,050
That's when I decided to get up!

1124
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:26,910
Got up, walked up my house, and came here.

1125
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:28,990
Don't you have a family?

1126
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:30,810
Did you leave your family?

1127
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:35,250
And here I remain, just taking it all in!

1128
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:36,410
Nice!

1129
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:38,890
Imagine he has a family, he just walked out.

1130
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:42,750
Sorry about that!

1131
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:44,030
Rambling, I mean!

1132
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:45,050
Thanks, though!

1133
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:46,490
I appreciate it here!

1134
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:46,870
Here!

1135
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:48,150
I have this!

1136
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:49,630
Ooh, a legacy cap!

1137
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:50,430
What's that?

1138
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:52,650
Never forget to change your time!

1139
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:54,250
It's important!

1140
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:55,890
Yeah, surely he'll go back, right?

1141
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:57,010
Come on!

1142
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:58,250
I won't keep you longer!

1143
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:00,250
He's gonna go back, right?

1144
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:00,890
To his family?

1145
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:06,750
All right, that was a legacy.

1146
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:09,650
Made in com- com- Oh!

1147
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:11,890
Oh, is it like- Oh!

1148
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:14,290
It's like the old Mario hat, right?

1149
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:16,110
Can't tell!

1150
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:17,670
Can't tell what it looks like!

1151
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:18,710
Sorry!

1152
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:21,130
Nanny Polly has restricted entrance to the sewers!

1153
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:23,810
You're getting the official permit to enter here!

1154
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:24,710
Oh, I see you!

1155
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:25,590
What to do?

1156
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:26,470
What to do?

1157
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:28,230
Oh, it's a picture!

1158
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:29,010
Yeah!

1159
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:31,370
Yay!

1160
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:32,870
Picture time!

1161
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,760
Uh, what's over here?

1162
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,600
Hey, I'm walking here!

1163
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:41,600
All right, mister!

1164
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,540
Holy shit, this is a big area!

1165
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,060
This is a huge fucking map!

1166
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:46,720
Jesus Christ!

1167
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,780
A lot of movies are set in New Thong City!

1168
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:53,060
I won't get to be an extra one day!

1169
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:55,660
This is the best day of my life!

1170
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:59,300
You ever see a group of bananas take a toad off the street and brought daylight?

1171
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,020
Stuff him in the sack?

1172
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,160
Throw him into an army and no lives to raise?

1173
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:04,220
I'm telling you!

1174
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:06,460
Don't mess with the loan sharks!

1175
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:09,560
Okay, you guys over-exaggerated loan sharks!

1176
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:10,020
I...

1177
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:12,980
If I knew how fucking weak they were, I would have...

1178
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:14,580
I would not have bought...

1179
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:17,040
I would not have spent all my money on...

1180
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,020
On, like...

1181
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:18,580
Legas...

1182
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:19,320
On, like, caps.

1183
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,240
The mini training me has been a fantastic minion!

1184
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,220
I've been able to grow my workforce exponentially!

1185
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,160
There is one teensy tiny problem!

1186
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,460
My minions hate water!

1187
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:35,560
And they refuse to go into the sewer to retrieve the parts I need for my master plan!

1188
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:36,520
To steal!

1189
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:37,360
I mean...

1190
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:37,900
Oh, wait!

1191
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:38,340
That's...

1192
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:38,880
It's grown!

1193
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,160
Go to that moon!

1194
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:47,600
I need a long thingy thang, a short gizmo gadget, and a secret ingredient.

1195
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:48,140
Simple!

1196
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:50,920
Wait, where are you?

1197
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,720
One of you is the guy I traded.

1198
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:55,260
One of you is the guy I threw...

1199
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:56,060
Not threw, sorry.

1200
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:58,240
I gave away to Gru.

1201
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,560
It's not like Scam City or Crypto Kingdom.

1202
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,120
Oh, this street lamp is broken?

1203
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:07,280
All right.

1204
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:08,300
All right, let's talk to...

1205
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:09,100
Wait, Luigi!

1206
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,560
What the fuck are you doing with my ex-girlfriend?

1207
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,200
Huh?

1208
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:13,480
Bro!

1209
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:17,020
That's the bro code said you can never go...

1210
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:19,060
Go after the exes.

1211
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:23,280
A lot of people move to New Thang City thinking they'll make it big.

1212
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:27,100
Sooner or later, they realize there's no such thing as making it big.

1213
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:29,280
Instead, replace and find your place.

1214
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:30,340
Bro!

1215
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:32,060
That's the bro code!

1216
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:35,140
You never try and go after your bro's ex!

1217
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:38,300
Whoa there, friend.

1218
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,400
Be careful your plan on heading past this hallway.

1219
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:45,280
The employees of this building are way into Cap Challenge and all its wacky gimmicks.

1220
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,980
So be prepared for some unconventional battle.

1221
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:49,520
Wait, what does he mean by that?

1222
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,820
Lights, camera, action!

1223
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,120
What does he mean by unconventional?

1224
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,260
Oh my god, he sent his own people in.

1225
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,020
Alright, Luigi's not a bro.

1226
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,980
I can't believe he would do this to me.

1227
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,560
I can't believe it.

1228
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:17,120
Wait, what did he do?

1229
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,980
Oh, using his focus stash.

1230
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:20,120
I was like, how are you alive?

1231
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:24,220
I was like, bro, he's sad on you.

1232
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,520
How the fuck are you alive?

1233
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,380
There's imprints and everything.

1234
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:34,510
What would Daisy say?

1235
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:36,310
Is it because of the elephant man?

1236
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:37,370
Is it because...

1237
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:42,150
Alright.

1238
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:44,390
A life that also hurts the user.

1239
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:45,770
No, you are not hurting yourself.

1240
00:47:46,610 --> 00:47:48,450
Is it because of him?

1241
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:51,410
Is he just not into that?

1242
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:55,790
Oh, battle!

1243
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:57,250
Oh, that's cute.

1244
00:47:57,610 --> 00:47:58,050
That's cute.

1245
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:01,350
My item!

1246
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:04,230
Okay, not cute no more.

1247
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:05,630
How dare you?

1248
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:08,530
I was trying to capitalize this fight.

1249
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:08,550
I was trying to capitalize this fight.

1250
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:13,130
Alright.

1251
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:13,590
Yay!

1252
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:17,270
Okay.

1253
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:19,150
Here!

1254
00:48:19,470 --> 00:48:20,370
Sure you want to fight me?

1255
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:23,530
Avocatia is completely invincible to all damage.

1256
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:25,070
Well, want to go?

1257
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:27,630
Don't say I didn't warn you!

1258
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:28,610
There's no way.

1259
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:32,050
There's no way they have a mod that's invincible to all damage.

1260
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:33,490
Dry bones?

1261
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:35,530
Oh, it's shiny!

1262
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:37,430
It's like a little blue.

1263
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:38,670
That's right.

1264
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:39,690
Wait, what?

1265
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:44,770
Does that work every time?

1266
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:45,830
What is that?

1267
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:47,690
Oh, no.

1268
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:48,270
That's a lie.

1269
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:50,510
I was like, what the fuck did he do?

1270
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:51,610
Okay, never mind.

1271
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:53,930
I was like, what the fuck is Wonder Guard?

1272
00:48:55,370 --> 00:48:55,670
Yay!

1273
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,720
Kofi, thank you for the super chat.

1274
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:02,040
Thank you.

1275
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:02,780
Thank you.

1276
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:06,520
I keep getting recommended videos about shit happening to you, but never actually watch.

1277
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,320
Tyrant, so time for a change!

1278
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:09,760
You seem hella chill.

1279
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:16,140
To be fair, this is one of my more chiller, um, chill play-throughs.

1280
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:22,140
Some other, some other streams get pretty fucking wild, but I'm glad you've been enjoying my stream.

1281
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,900
Thank you for watching, and thank you for the super chat.

1282
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,060
Go ahead.

1283
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:29,560
Oh my god, oh my god.

1284
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:31,140
Jump scare.

1285
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:33,560
Noki-noki.

1286
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,140
Birdo is in here?

1287
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,960
Oh my god, don't worry.

1288
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:40,280
Don't worry, Dragoons.

1289
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,540
I'm getting your girlfriend in.

1290
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:43,780
I'm...

1291
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:50,400
Like, sometimes hand stuff just isn't enough.

1292
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:56,360
Sorry.

1293
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,400
It was just right there, guys.

1294
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:58,940
I'm sorry.

1295
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,000
Like, literally, it was, like, right there.

1296
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:02,680
Like...

1297
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:11,180
The fact it was a hat.

1298
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:13,480
Alright.

1299
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:15,180
Let's see.

1300
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:17,150
Attack that observes half the damage inflicted.

1301
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:20,840
Fuck it.

1302
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,060
Let's just get Bug Bite out.

1303
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:26,630
Alright.

1304
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:28,170
Get out Drain Punch.

1305
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:30,550
Or get Drain Punch in here.

1306
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,280
Okay.

1307
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:35,660
Oh my god.

1308
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:36,660
Actual Birdo.

1309
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:37,000
Okay.

1310
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:37,880
This time...

1311
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:39,500
We aren't gonna get Catfish, guys.

1312
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,520
This time we're gonna have a good time.

1313
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:42,980
Yay!

1314
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:44,640
Wait.

1315
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,040
Oh, he got jealous.

1316
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:47,120
The hand got jealous.

1317
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,100
Oh, why is he still in my party?

1318
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:53,840
Don't think I forgot.

1319
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,500
Don't think I didn't forget.

1320
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,880
I'll give you one more chance, little guy.

1321
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:01,080
One more chance.

1322
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:08,700
I thought I could get the win on anyone if I can't jump on them.

1323
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:09,360
Alright.

1324
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:10,280
Get over here.

1325
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,640
Behold my secret techniques!

1326
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:13,680
Alright.

1327
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:14,680
What's your secret technique?

1328
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,480
Nice day for catfishing, isn't it?

1329
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:20,020
Ain't it?

1330
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:20,500
Oh-ho!

1331
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:23,640
Alright.

1332
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:24,400
Star Bag.

1333
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,040
Don't worry.

1334
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:28,260
I know how to beat this.

1335
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,080
My one move.

1336
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:33,380
My one move that gets super chats.

1337
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:34,880
That's it.

1338
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:39,640
Goodbye, Star Bag.

1339
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:42,860
Yeah!

1340
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,700
What a shy guy.

1341
00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:51,080
Oh, look how tiny he is.

1342
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,840
Time to sit on him.

1343
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:58,220
This has honestly been the best move he's ever learned.

1344
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:03,500
What's he gonna do?

1345
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:04,980
Electrocute me?

1346
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:07,540
Paralyze me?

1347
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:08,860
Don't worry.

1348
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,080
I have another 10k lying around.

1349
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:14,280
Alright.

1350
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:14,620
Yay!

1351
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:18,140
Bye, secret technique.

1352
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:20,380
Alright.

1353
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,200
What do you have for me?

1354
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,640
Magus passed all my employees?

1355
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:25,100
Well done!

1356
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:27,760
But I won't be such a pushover.

1357
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:28,340
Alright.

1358
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,360
Time to beat up the boss and take his company.

1359
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,420
Oh shit, guys.

1360
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:35,740
I don't know if I should sit on that.

1361
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:39,380
Guys.

1362
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:42,540
I don't think it's a good idea to sit on that, guys.

1363
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:48,760
For the sake of that.

1364
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:50,880
We will not do it.

1365
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:51,740
The coward!

1366
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:53,260
Oh shit!

1367
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:53,880
No!

1368
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:55,600
They forgot to yell him!

1369
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,680
Alright, that's fine.

1370
00:52:58,980 --> 00:52:59,500
That's fine.

1371
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:00,640
That's not it.

1372
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:04,760
Alright.

1373
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:05,900
We just need grass.

1374
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:07,620
We have stick bug.

1375
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:09,500
Alright, stick bug.

1376
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:10,980
This is your time to shine.

1377
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:13,920
Alright.

1378
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:16,320
Wait.

1379
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:18,000
I don't have...

1380
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,620
Wait, where's my grass move?

1381
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,080
Shit.

1382
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:22,020
I can't.

1383
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:24,980
Sorry, I forgot about movesets.

1384
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:25,380
Alright.

1385
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:26,540
I forgot.

1386
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:27,460
Okay.

1387
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,060
That's not...

1388
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:29,680
That's a bug.

1389
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:30,300
Alright.

1390
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:31,020
Don't worry.

1391
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:32,560
This is your time to shine.

1392
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:33,600
Right here.

1393
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:35,760
Alright.

1394
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:36,560
This is it.

1395
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:37,620
This is your one chance.

1396
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:39,300
If you don't make it.

1397
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:40,560
Okay.

1398
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,080
Nevermind.

1399
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:51,820
I guess he didn't make it, guys.

1400
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:52,740
I...

1401
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:54,100
I guess he...

1402
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:55,740
He didn't make it.

1403
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:56,560
Alright.

1404
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:00,680
I mean, bugs live on grass.

1405
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:01,680
That's like...

1406
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,080
That's how it works, right?

1407
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:07,260
You set him up for failure.

1408
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:08,540
How did I...

1409
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:09,040
Okay.

1410
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,060
I thought that like...

1411
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:12,340
You know...

1412
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:12,900
He would...

1413
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:15,780
The boomerang would have like a watered subtype.

1414
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:16,220
Okay.

1415
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,520
And I thought that, you know...

1416
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:19,400
He'd be okay.

1417
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,220
He'd be okay.

1418
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:23,120
I thought...

1419
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,620
I thought he would survive.

1420
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:29,220
I didn't expect him to fucking get demolished by one move.

1421
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,400
Hammer Bros said again.

1422
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:35,520
Holy fuck.

1423
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:35,980
Bro.

1424
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:36,200
Okay.

1425
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,660
Hammer Bros is a little too strong.

1426
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:41,060
Hammer Bros might be a little too strong, guys.

1427
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,260
A magnet bomb.

1428
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:42,300
Yeah.

1429
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,100
Surely that would do more damage, right?

1430
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:47,920
Oh, yeah.

1431
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:48,620
It does.

1432
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:48,980
Nice.

1433
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:52,640
Okay.

1434
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:53,780
That's fine.

1435
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,300
Heffley, you got this.

1436
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:56,220
I believe in you.

1437
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:57,860
Okay.

1438
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,460
The boss might be a little strong.

1439
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:00,000
Okay.

1440
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:02,140
It might be a mistake to let die...

1441
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:03,560
To let dad die there.

1442
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:08,840
Okay.

1443
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:09,720
I have a secret weapon.

1444
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:11,160
Okay.

1445
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:11,880
You are not sleeping.

1446
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,000
You're not sleeping.

1447
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:14,680
You're not sleeping.

1448
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,900
My secret weapon will not learn how to sleep.

1449
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:20,080
If I'm not sleeping, you're not sleeping.

1450
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:21,720
Okay.

1451
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:22,880
Yeah, let's...

1452
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,380
You know what?

1453
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:25,720
I believe in you.

1454
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:27,000
I'm a...

1455
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,860
It's a fucking giant T-Rex.

1456
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:30,160
There's no way.

1457
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:38,040
All right.

1458
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:40,540
It's time...

1459
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:40,680
Ooh.

1460
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:41,680
Breaking sweat.

1461
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:42,100
All right.

1462
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,020
It's time to use the dragon tail.

1463
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:48,280
All right.

1464
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:48,680
Yes!

1465
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:49,860
Slam him!

1466
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,180
Slam him again!

1467
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:54,540
Oh, shit.

1468
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:54,840
Okay.

1469
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:55,520
Never mind.

1470
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:56,220
He protected himself.

1471
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:58,420
And then I have poison.

1472
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:58,820
Okay.

1473
00:55:58,820 --> 00:55:59,620
That's a little awkward.

1474
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:08,970
Slam him again!

1475
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:10,550
Yes!

1476
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:12,230
I knew...

1477
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:14,530
I knew my T-Rex will win this.

1478
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:20,160
Yay!

1479
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:21,940
Everybody's leveling up.

1480
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:22,540
Let's go!

1481
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:23,880
Um...

1482
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:24,660
My strategy!

1483
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,440
What was it?

1484
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:28,220
Crabble!

1485
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:31,860
Not many people in New Donk City can feed all of us like that.

1486
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:32,340
Here!

1487
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:33,660
Go ahead and have this!

1488
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:36,440
Wait, I did all of that and all I got was a fucking TM40.

1489
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:38,640
Also, by the way, that reminded me...

1490
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:42,200
I came back from traveling and then I saw that Bandai sent me something.

1491
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:43,860
And I was like, oh, what's this?

1492
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:46,580
And then it was like related to like...

1493
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:47,160
Um...

1494
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:48,320
The Elder Ring...

1495
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:48,560
Night...

1496
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,480
Night Ring thing I participated in.

1497
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,440
And then it's literally a t-shirt where like...

1498
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:53,780
I...

1499
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:57,900
I played Elder Ring...

1500
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:58,520
Night Ring...

1501
00:56:58,520 --> 00:56:59,220
And I defeat...

1502
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:00,240
And all I got...

1503
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:00,620
And I...

1504
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:01,840
And I defeated...

1505
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,820
Like I defeated the Night Lord and all I got was this t-shirt.

1506
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:06,180
Type shirt.

1507
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:07,520
So it was literally like...

1508
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:08,520
The front was like...

1509
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:09,160
Elder Ring...

1510
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:09,820
Night Ring...

1511
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:11,400
And the back was like...

1512
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,140
I defeated a Night Lord.

1513
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:15,040
So it's literally one of those shirts.

1514
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:15,780
I...

1515
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:23,040
And the back lady said, I defeated the Night Lord.

1516
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:27,300
So it felt like I participated in the event and all I got was this t-shirt.

1517
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:33,540
Come back and fight us again anytime.

1518
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:35,200
Don't be a stranger.

1519
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:39,400
Wow.

1520
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:40,220
I know.

1521
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:41,580
I'll show a photo of it later.

1522
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:45,100
My participation award.

1523
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:49,200
Yeah, yeah, like the fucking speedrunners got an actual, like, sword.

1524
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:50,260
A sword?

1525
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:50,720
What was that?

1526
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,160
A sword?

1527
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:52,340
A shield?

1528
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:53,680
And something else?

1529
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,440
And all I got was a t-shirt.

1530
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:59,820
I defeated the Night Lord and all I got was a t-shirt.

1531
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:03,580
Yeah, the people who won the competition...

1532
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:05,580
Because it was, like, a low-key tournament.

1533
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:10,980
And, of course, like, you know, whoever kills the Night Lord the fastest...

1534
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:12,620
The three Night Lords the fastest.

1535
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,860
So, of course, like, the speedrunner...

1536
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:17,000
Um, the speedrunners were gonna...

1537
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:17,880
We're gonna win that.

1538
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:20,300
And the prize was literally, like, a sword and a shield.

1539
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:23,760
What's this?

1540
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,340
Welcome to New Donk City Pit.

1541
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:28,960
Are you willing to hit and reap the rewards of win?

1542
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:30,000
What's this?

1543
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:33,040
Once you explore, death's with pit and try to reach...

1544
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:33,540
Oh, okay.

1545
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:34,540
Oh, so...

1546
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:35,400
Wait.

1547
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:38,100
For a special explorers pack for your items.

1548
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,760
You fill out any items once...

1549
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,740
And there can be no rest until you make it.

1550
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:42,680
Wait, can you catch them?

1551
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:45,400
Sorry, I did skip a skip a...

1552
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:49,700
Seven villains, but also wild captures.

1553
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,200
Oh, you can capture things!

1554
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,120
But can you actually keep them?

1555
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:00,340
It doesn't say.

1556
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,720
Oh, you're gonna keep one after...

1557
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:04,500
Okay, goodbye.

1558
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:08,640
If I can't keep, I leave.

1559
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,620
One after seven rounds?

1560
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:11,440
That's too much.

1561
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:12,360
That's too many.

1562
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,640
That's one too many rounds.

1563
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:15,260
Alright, I'll watch.

1564
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:16,240
Take...

1565
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,640
Take that, Pauline!

1566
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:20,280
Private, use razor shell!

1567
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:22,160
I forgot the accent I gave Luigi.

1568
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,480
Luigi is the victor!

1569
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:28,360
Luigi!

1570
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:29,300
Luigi!

1571
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:30,380
Luigi!

1572
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,540
Aw, you're all so kind.

1573
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:36,520
And you'll make this so much fun.

1574
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:39,740
Great idea to battle outside, Luigi.

1575
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:42,380
I need to return to some mayoral duties.

1576
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,320
So I'll be seeing you around.

1577
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:50,040
Mario!

1578
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:51,040
Bro!

1579
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,620
You finally made it to New Donk City!

1580
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:55,580
I was wondering when you get here.

1581
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:58,820
I would have waited for you to watch me battle Pauline.

1582
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,700
She's on a strict schedule.

1583
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:02,480
So I had to take my chance.

1584
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:06,120
Hey, it feels like forever ago since we had a good battle.

1585
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:07,680
Let's have one right now.

1586
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:17,100
Are we actually gonna watch the Mario Bros battle each other for free?

1587
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:19,920
What's Mario Team's B?

1588
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:23,800
I mean, they don't both have at least five power stars?

1589
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:26,860
Let me heal your body up before we do this.

1590
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:28,300
Okay, thanks, Luigi.

1591
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:31,700
They're already fully healed, but like, you know, it's the thought that counts.

1592
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:32,980
Let's go!

1593
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:40,680
Oh, he has five mons now!

1594
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:41,900
I wonder who it's his fifth one.

1595
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:43,620
The Chuck Stack.

1596
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,480
It's been a while since we battled, Mario.

1597
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:48,580
I'm excited!

1598
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:50,240
Mamma Mia!

1599
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:51,520
Alright, I'm gonna sit on it.

1600
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:58,680
Even though they're bigger, they're still tiny as fuck.

1601
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:02,780
Yeah, Chuck Stack did great.

1602
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:04,120
He lasted like two seconds.

1603
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:05,060
Good for you, Luigi.

1604
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:06,960
Wait, who's Bubbles?

1605
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:08,800
Okay, Bubbles is...

1606
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:09,200
Yes.

1607
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,220
Okay, Bubbles sounds like a water tank.

1608
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:12,360
Alright.

1609
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:13,720
Oh, I forgot you're still here.

1610
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:14,080
Alright.

1611
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:16,620
This is your redemption arc, part five.

1612
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:18,980
I gave you five chances.

1613
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:20,380
This is...

1614
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:23,260
I...

1615
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:24,020
Oh my god.

1616
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:24,480
Okay.

1617
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:25,740
Good luck.

1618
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:28,340
Alright.

1619
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:30,660
Magical Leaf.

1620
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:34,840
No other dragon has had many chances as you two.

1621
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:35,860
Oh.

1622
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:40,680
He's fire type.

1623
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:46,080
Well then.

1624
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:47,220
Oh, that's awkward.

1625
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:48,140
Okay.

1626
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:49,640
So.

1627
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:50,600
Um.

1628
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:52,180
Goodbye.

1629
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:55,280
Alright.

1630
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:56,580
Back to dad.

1631
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,160
Look, his name was Bubbles!

1632
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:00,620
You assume he's water!

1633
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,700
Like, I don't understand.

1634
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,520
Like, you would think he's water.

1635
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:07,000
Cause he's, like, his name was Bubbles.

1636
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:10,040
I said...

1637
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:11,900
How did I set him up for failure?

1638
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:14,140
I saw the name Bubbles!

1639
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,660
It's fire and water.

1640
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:21,320
Who...

1641
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:27,080
Why would anyone think, like, fire and water would be the combination for types?

1642
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:28,840
It's fire and water.

1643
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:29,560
It's like oil.

1644
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:31,020
Oil and water.

1645
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:32,340
Alright.

1646
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:33,080
No.

1647
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:37,980
Silly me for trying to send someone out that's not dad.

1648
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:39,360
Alright.

1649
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:40,300
Now sit on him.

1650
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:42,600
Because it's cool.

1651
01:02:48,010 --> 01:02:50,070
What is this fucking Spongebob?

1652
01:02:50,190 --> 01:02:51,150
Fire and water?

1653
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:55,450
Alright.

1654
01:02:55,690 --> 01:02:56,110
Private.

1655
01:02:57,290 --> 01:02:58,150
Doesn't matter.

1656
01:02:58,490 --> 01:02:59,870
He only has two mons left.

1657
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:01,890
Now sit on him.

1658
01:03:01,890 --> 01:03:02,930
Oh shit.

1659
01:03:02,990 --> 01:03:04,030
He also has acrobatic.

1660
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:05,870
Oh fuck that.

1661
01:03:06,130 --> 01:03:06,590
What?

1662
01:03:08,170 --> 01:03:10,130
That had so much HP!

1663
01:03:13,770 --> 01:03:14,090
Okay.

1664
01:03:15,370 --> 01:03:15,930
Okay.

1665
01:03:16,970 --> 01:03:20,110
We'll just send in a fucking giant T-Rex in New Donk City.

1666
01:03:21,950 --> 01:03:23,890
He sat on me.

1667
01:03:25,090 --> 01:03:25,730
Alright.

1668
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:26,510
Dragon tail.

1669
01:03:28,290 --> 01:03:30,350
No way does that match much damage.

1670
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:31,010
There you go.

1671
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:32,770
Stupid fucking acrobatic.

1672
01:03:34,050 --> 01:03:34,910
What the heck?

1673
01:03:35,370 --> 01:03:37,130
Oh he sent in another Yoshi...

1674
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:37,370
Yoshi...

1675
01:03:37,370 --> 01:03:38,630
Yoshi Seros?

1676
01:03:39,130 --> 01:03:39,550
Aww.

1677
01:03:39,770 --> 01:03:41,450
Luigi couldn't have his own Yoshi.

1678
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:44,050
So he like...

1679
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:44,430
Just...

1680
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:46,390
He just named one after Yoshi.

1681
01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:47,830
That's so sad.

1682
01:03:48,310 --> 01:03:49,770
That's actually so sad.

1683
01:03:49,770 --> 01:03:49,850
That's so sad.

1684
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:53,880
Yeah.

1685
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:57,980
Oh dragon tail.

1686
01:03:58,100 --> 01:03:59,140
Oh it swaps...

1687
01:03:59,140 --> 01:03:59,960
I didn't know that.

1688
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:01,540
I didn't realize it swaps out the mod.

1689
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:03,920
I'm pretty sure it is dragon.

1690
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:04,440
He...

1691
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:05,060
He looked...

1692
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:06,480
He named it after Yoshi.

1693
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:07,540
Holy shit.

1694
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,820
There's no way he can bulldoze my T-Rex.

1695
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:11,800
He's much bigger than him.

1696
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:15,820
Get out of here.

1697
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:17,880
Oh he wasn't dragon type.

1698
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:25,000
Alright.

1699
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:26,320
You know what?

1700
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:27,340
I'll send in Yoshi.

1701
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:29,020
I'll send in you guys.

1702
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:29,780
Dragoons.

1703
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:30,260
Come on.

1704
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:31,120
End it for me.

1705
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:32,940
End this dragon.

1706
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:34,800
You know what you wanna do?

1707
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:38,780
It's all up to you.

1708
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:42,060
Now lick him.

1709
01:04:44,860 --> 01:04:45,680
Oh shit.

1710
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:47,520
End it with a lick.

1711
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:48,900
That's right.

1712
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:50,000
Now do it again.

1713
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:01,120
Why are you like this?

1714
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,200
Thank you for the super chat.

1715
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:03,480
Thank you.

1716
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:03,980
Thank you.

1717
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:05,380
Doki from the last Mario mod.

1718
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:06,860
I looked up the last comic.

1719
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:08,080
I was an hour into reading.

1720
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:10,140
Thinking it was a short comic.

1721
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,580
You're trying to read the entire...

1722
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:14,700
I hope you're stronger than all of us.

1723
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:18,100
I can't believe you're trying to read the entire comic series.

1724
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:19,820
That's absolutely insane.

1725
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:22,560
That shit is so bad.

1726
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:26,200
Bro, there's no way you lose to Pauline.

1727
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:30,160
Wow, bro.

1728
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:31,540
You sure are strong.

1729
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:34,220
Miss Pauline is going to be no match for you.

1730
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:36,980
Say, have you seen Bowser around?

1731
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:38,180
My new best friend?

1732
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:41,300
I got to Newtong City and haven't seen him anywhere.

1733
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:43,360
I'm sure he's not up to any trouble.

1734
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:46,040
I've been teaching him the power of friendship.

1735
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:50,360
Oh, you guys know there's like a very popular ship with Bowser and Luigi.

1736
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:54,300
I literally taught him how to move return.

1737
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,900
Anyway, Newtong City is really big.

1738
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:01,320
So I'm going to explore a bit before moving on to World 7.

1739
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:02,460
Later, bro.

1740
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:04,440
Yay, I did it.

1741
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:05,180
Okay, we got here.

1742
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:07,440
Oh, he's calling me.

1743
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:08,740
Excuse me, I have to take this.

1744
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,340
The line has been picked by the apple.

1745
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:13,160
No, it's not dumb.

1746
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:13,920
It makes sense.

1747
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:18,340
I mean, I'm having toilet troubles.

1748
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:20,100
I'll be in the sewers.

1749
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:21,800
Immediately.

1750
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:24,480
All right, let's see.

1751
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:27,360
Someone was like, I only know Bowser and Peach.

1752
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,180
Oh, you poor, innocent soul.

1753
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:30,960
You sweet, innocent soul.

1754
01:06:31,060 --> 01:06:32,400
I wish I have your innocence.

1755
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:33,960
I've seen things.

1756
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:39,680
I was on Tumblr during his peak.

1757
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:41,560
I've seen so many things.

1758
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:52,180
Mayor Pauline's steel-type captures are scary.

1759
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:54,420
Make sure you bring some fire-types to melt them.

1760
01:06:54,580 --> 01:06:56,080
Oh, good thing I have dead.

1761
01:06:57,020 --> 01:06:59,080
I'm going to have to revalue my cap trainers.

1762
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:01,200
So watch this online after that one.

1763
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,680
You'll stay consistent, won't you, Mario?

1764
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:05,340
A lot of people...

1765
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:06,060
Oh, yeah, I already read that.

1766
01:07:09,530 --> 01:07:14,750
I traveled to the Metro Kingdom from Tostolina in order to complain about the pipe issue.

1767
01:07:14,890 --> 01:07:16,250
But now I don't want to leave.

1768
01:07:16,430 --> 01:07:17,670
Oh, there's a secret behind here?

1769
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:19,470
What's the secret?

1770
01:07:22,590 --> 01:07:24,110
There's no secret, you lies.

1771
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:30,300
All right, no secret here.

1772
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:31,300
What do you mean?

1773
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:33,760
Oh, middle top?

1774
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:35,460
Here?

1775
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:40,960
Oh, look up.

1776
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:41,360
Oh!

1777
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:42,720
Maya!

1778
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:43,400
Oh, fuck.

1779
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:44,160
Not him.

1780
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:46,280
Maya, it's me!

1781
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:47,400
Captain Toad!

1782
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:48,200
That's me!

1783
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:49,480
You here of all places, huh?

1784
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:51,240
I know something from me to you!

1785
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:52,400
Okay, the catching shot.

1786
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:53,020
I was like, no!

1787
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:54,160
Not him!

1788
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:56,680
Bobby, you can share new captures.

1789
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:58,140
You're probably pretty great, am I right?

1790
01:07:58,580 --> 01:07:59,120
Well then!

1791
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:00,640
I'll be continuing on my journey!

1792
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:02,080
Okay, thank god.

1793
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:02,420
Okay.

1794
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:05,460
Interactions with him was minimal, thank god.

1795
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:08,140
All right, what is this?

1796
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,860
A charm that raises...

1797
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:15,420
the chance of critical capture?

1798
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,400
But how do I use this, though?

1799
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:18,820
Oh!

1800
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:20,140
Wait, what?

1801
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:21,780
How do I use this charm?

1802
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:23,320
I don't know how to use it.

1803
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:26,660
Oh, it's a passive.

1804
01:08:26,860 --> 01:08:27,960
Oh, so I just have...

1805
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:29,100
So it just works.

1806
01:08:30,220 --> 01:08:31,380
You know what are the other guys saying?

1807
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:31,960
I have for...

1808
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:32,500
I have to have...

1809
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:33,680
I can't melt steel beams.

1810
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:34,680
Dang it!

1811
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:37,180
Probably went and lost to your friend of all people?

1812
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:39,340
What a battle!

1813
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:40,520
What did you really get?

1814
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:41,560
Okay, I won.

1815
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:44,960
What the fuck?

1816
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:47,340
I won and they're still glazing Luigi.

1817
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:49,680
Going somewhere, chum?

1818
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:52,140
Oh, no, don't.

1819
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:52,800
Oh, no.

1820
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:53,220
Oh, wait.

1821
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:53,660
They're back.

1822
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:54,300
You're coming.

1823
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:55,520
Oh, it's the low sharks!

1824
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:56,500
That's right.

1825
01:08:56,580 --> 01:08:57,960
I'm not scared of you.

1826
01:08:58,620 --> 01:09:00,540
You think I'm scared of you guys?

1827
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:02,380
I beat you up last time.

1828
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:05,040
Now then, you should know what we want from you.

1829
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:06,160
No!

1830
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:10,020
I'm a strong, independent Italian plumber.

1831
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:11,720
I'm very smart, pal.

1832
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:13,640
Now we gotta teach you a lesson.

1833
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:15,080
That's right.

1834
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:17,140
I'm not afraid of you.

1835
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:19,020
I know you can bleed.

1836
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:21,660
Okay.

1837
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:22,760
Oh, wait.

1838
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:24,020
That's a little bit of a problem.

1839
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:25,020
Wait.

1840
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:25,280
Okay.

1841
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:26,300
They're both pretty big.

1842
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:28,900
That's a little bit.

1843
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:29,560
Okay.

1844
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:30,200
No, that's fine.

1845
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:30,740
That's fine.

1846
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:31,280
That's fine.

1847
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:32,200
It still works.

1848
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:33,380
Okay.

1849
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:33,900
He missed.

1850
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:34,500
Don't worry.

1851
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:35,340
It still works.

1852
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:39,120
Omni, thank you for the super chat.

1853
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:39,420
Thank you.

1854
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:40,100
Thank you.

1855
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:45,680
If you toss Bowser in Super Mario 64, how far do you think you could get her?

1856
01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:48,140
Um...

1857
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:50,520
Why would I do it when I could pay someone else to do it?

1858
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:58,960
I gotta delegate.

1859
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:00,620
It's all about delegation, guys.

1860
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:02,260
You think I have time for that shit?

1861
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:07,140
I think people will do it for free, too.

1862
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:10,680
It's all about delegation.

1863
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:16,790
Alright.

1864
01:10:17,110 --> 01:10:17,530
Nice.

1865
01:10:17,530 --> 01:10:17,630
Nice.

1866
01:10:17,970 --> 01:10:19,090
Bye, Strudan.

1867
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:26,940
Why the fuck did he not hit him at all?

1868
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:28,780
Like, I just need to hit one attack.

1869
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:29,780
Definitely.

1870
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:31,180
Oh, wait.

1871
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:32,220
I still have the other...

1872
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:33,500
Oh, what the fuck?

1873
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:34,760
Histocrat.

1874
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:35,280
Oh, my God.

1875
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:35,920
He's so fat.

1876
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:36,160
Okay.

1877
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:36,840
I almost...

1878
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:39,200
I almost used...

1879
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:41,380
I almost used a really bad move.

1880
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:43,460
Okay.

1881
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:44,040
I'll just fly.

1882
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:47,340
Flew up too high.

1883
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:48,640
Alright.

1884
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,220
Get out of here.

1885
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:54,480
Yeah.

1886
01:10:55,820 --> 01:10:56,260
Easy.

1887
01:10:57,780 --> 01:10:58,800
Oh, he missed?

1888
01:10:58,980 --> 01:10:59,100
What?

1889
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:00,960
Like, I just closed my eyes?

1890
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:02,440
Like, how do you miss that?

1891
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:08,600
He's in the sky.

1892
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:10,380
You can barely see him.

1893
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:11,160
How...

1894
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:13,940
How can you get intimidated by someone in the sky?

1895
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:19,040
All right.

1896
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:19,440
All right.

1897
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:20,520
Goodbye, Chain Chomp.

1898
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:21,200
Bye.

1899
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:24,460
That's fucking right.

1900
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:26,880
Fire's good against steel.

1901
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:30,380
I just learned that from that one random toad.

1902
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:35,260
Okay.

1903
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,000
I think I can sit on it.

1904
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:39,360
I'll just magnet bomb this.

1905
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:41,600
He's just floating there, menacingly.

1906
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:42,900
He's still scared.

1907
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:43,460
Like, what?

1908
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,040
He just squints and sees him?

1909
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:46,620
And, like, be like, oh, my God.

1910
01:11:48,020 --> 01:11:48,460
Like...

1911
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:52,940
He sort of vaguely looks scary if I squint hard enough.

1912
01:11:58,490 --> 01:11:58,970
Yeah.

1913
01:12:03,850 --> 01:12:04,610
Meteor mash.

1914
01:12:04,830 --> 01:12:05,190
Oh, wait.

1915
01:12:05,410 --> 01:12:06,930
Do I send in, like, a meteor down?

1916
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:09,010
Fire's a mirror-like punch.

1917
01:12:09,210 --> 01:12:10,110
May raise attack.

1918
01:12:10,430 --> 01:12:10,570
Okay.

1919
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:11,170
60.

1920
01:12:11,550 --> 01:12:11,830
Oh, wait.

1921
01:12:12,010 --> 01:12:12,270
It's steel.

1922
01:12:13,090 --> 01:12:13,330
Okay.

1923
01:12:13,330 --> 01:12:14,250
I'm getting rid of rock throw.

1924
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:16,430
Rock throw was a fucking mistake of a move.

1925
01:12:21,940 --> 01:12:22,420
Yay.

1926
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:23,100
Goodbye.

1927
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,100
You stupid plumber.

1928
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:28,020
Boss, we're sorry.

1929
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:28,880
That's right.

1930
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:32,120
I bet you think you're so smart, plumber.

1931
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:34,180
All you do is delay the inevitable.

1932
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:36,180
All right.

1933
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:37,700
Don't think I forgot.

1934
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:40,620
You've had one...

1935
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:42,440
Five too many chances.

1936
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:45,920
Get in here.

1937
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:47,400
All right.

1938
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:48,360
You don't get this.

1939
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:50,560
You don't get the VIP box either.

1940
01:12:54,850 --> 01:12:55,730
You and him.

1941
01:12:56,550 --> 01:12:58,250
Can spend your life here.

1942
01:12:58,770 --> 01:12:59,170
Together.

1943
01:13:00,590 --> 01:13:01,070
All right.

1944
01:13:01,170 --> 01:13:01,650
What the fuck?

1945
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:02,410
What was this?

1946
01:13:02,590 --> 01:13:03,470
How did he get here?

1947
01:13:03,550 --> 01:13:04,090
Oh, Husky.

1948
01:13:04,190 --> 01:13:04,450
Oh, yeah.

1949
01:13:04,690 --> 01:13:05,590
You fucked up too.

1950
01:13:05,870 --> 01:13:06,610
Don't think I forgot.

1951
01:13:08,830 --> 01:13:09,350
All right.

1952
01:13:09,450 --> 01:13:09,950
There you go.

1953
01:13:14,310 --> 01:13:14,890
Let's see.

1954
01:13:15,030 --> 01:13:16,930
Who should we get to replace him?

1955
01:13:22,950 --> 01:13:23,930
You know what?

1956
01:13:24,910 --> 01:13:26,990
It's time for a hero to return.

1957
01:13:31,330 --> 01:13:32,190
It's time.

1958
01:13:33,010 --> 01:13:35,350
It's time for the hero to return.

1959
01:13:36,390 --> 01:13:37,870
Back to its roots.

1960
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:39,310
Oh, wait.

1961
01:13:39,350 --> 01:13:40,110
We got another one.

1962
01:13:40,450 --> 01:13:41,330
I almost forgot about you.

1963
01:13:43,690 --> 01:13:44,310
There you go.

1964
01:13:45,650 --> 01:13:47,150
Well, called out of retirement.

1965
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:48,910
One last job.

1966
01:13:55,270 --> 01:13:56,430
One last job.

1967
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:01,460
All right.

1968
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:02,520
We got to heal real quick.

1969
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:04,360
Ami, thank you for the super chat.

1970
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:04,640
Thank you.

1971
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:05,120
Thank you.

1972
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:09,800
Would you choose someone to throw a mint based on how far they could toss her or how low they were willing to be paid for it?

1973
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:10,920
No, I'm gonna...

1974
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:11,860
No, you'll pay me.

1975
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:13,840
I don't think you guys realize that.

1976
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,040
But, like, I know...

1977
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:17,420
I will auction it off.

1978
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:24,940
You'll pay me to throw a mint off.

1979
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:26,160
Welcome.

1980
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,180
This is Newtong City Hall.

1981
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,340
Lady Pauline is just up ahead.

1982
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:31,900
Repel and a challenger.

1983
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:34,460
Be aware she used steel-type captures.

1984
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:38,300
That Koopa Troop patrol on the other side of the room.

1985
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:39,360
What's this game?

1986
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:41,040
What's this game?

1987
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:42,680
What can a proud...

1988
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:42,980
Oh, sorry.

1989
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:47,140
What can a proud Koopa Troop admin not get some relaxation around here?

1990
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:51,860
Isn't Lady Pauline sing just the best?

1991
01:14:52,060 --> 01:14:54,240
I could stay here and listen to her forever.

1992
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:57,920
Mario, it's so wonderful to see you again.

1993
01:14:58,140 --> 01:15:00,160
And also, wonderful timing.

1994
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:02,020
I have a favor to ask you.

1995
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:03,540
Well, actually two.

1996
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:07,340
First, I can't seem to find my microphone all of a sudden.

1997
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:10,660
I like to do a show while battling for power stars.

1998
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:13,540
But without my microphone, the show can't start.

1999
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:14,920
Mind helping me?

2000
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:15,800
Great.

2001
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:17,860
Now, the second issue.

2002
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:21,060
Our sewer systems are having some unusual backups.

2003
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:22,780
We hired some plumbers.

2004
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:25,080
But they seem to be busy with other jobs.

2005
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:26,380
I know.

2006
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:27,940
I'm asking for a lot.

2007
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:31,880
But I'll reward you handsomely if you do both.

2008
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:33,340
Oh my god, guys.

2009
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:35,460
I think she wants to get back together.

2010
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:39,000
I say delusionally.

2011
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:47,380
You should be able to get into the sewage through the manhole to the west of town.

2012
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:49,220
Come see me when you're done.

2013
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:50,940
Alright.

2014
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:53,700
Oh my god, guys.

2015
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:55,100
I think she still wants me.

2016
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:55,760
I knew it.

2017
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:58,320
I knew this relationship was not over.

2018
01:15:58,600 --> 01:15:59,860
It's salvageable.

2019
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:02,240
Yeah.

2020
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:03,160
Thank you for the super chat.

2021
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:03,520
Thank you.

2022
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:04,000
Thank you.

2023
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:06,100
You should auction it off to the west instead of us.

2024
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,320
You'd make way more.

2025
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:11,040
Thank you for the super chat.

2026
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:11,380
Thank you.

2027
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:12,020
Thank you.

2028
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,480
That's right, bitch.

2029
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:23,120
Oh, there must be wild mons here.

2030
01:16:25,340 --> 01:16:27,160
What the f- Oh my god, it's that guy.

2031
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:28,460
Yeah, this fucking freak.

2032
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:32,460
I forgot about this fucking freak.

2033
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:33,540
Alright, baseball cap.

2034
01:16:35,940 --> 01:16:38,080
She wants me so bad, guys.

2035
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:39,160
I can feel it.

2036
01:16:42,020 --> 01:16:43,600
Alright, I'm just gonna use capture.

2037
01:16:43,740 --> 01:16:45,760
If this doesn't work, I'll just send in...

2038
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:52,740
Alright, we'll send in...

2039
01:16:52,740 --> 01:16:54,300
We'll send in the usual crew.

2040
01:16:54,580 --> 01:16:55,680
Get in there, Dragoon.

2041
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:56,480
The usual.

2042
01:16:57,540 --> 01:17:00,020
It was boring this way.

2043
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:05,720
You gotta get those fucking tumors checked out, that's for sure.

2044
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:08,620
Alright, lick it.

2045
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,460
Oh shit, that's not a lot of damage.

2046
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:14,460
Alright, maybe bite it?

2047
01:17:17,220 --> 01:17:18,220
Alright, keep biting.

2048
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:21,500
Just make sure you avoid the...

2049
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:22,680
The little...

2050
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:23,500
Sack...

2051
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:24,300
Sack fluids.

2052
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:33,280
Alright.

2053
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:34,740
Alright, who wants to be the...

2054
01:17:34,740 --> 01:17:35,440
Oh wait, never mind.

2055
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:36,260
I almost had him.

2056
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:37,900
Okay, let me bite him again.

2057
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:40,240
Alright, there we go.

2058
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:44,340
What game is he from?

2059
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:46,900
Jesus, what the fuck did he do?

2060
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:48,060
Did he spit on me?

2061
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:49,940
Sorry, spit on you guys?

2062
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:56,240
What?

2063
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:57,320
Get in here!

2064
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:02,100
Oh my god, he literally showed up to me in Sire moveset and he's still not in the cap.

2065
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:06,340
Oh, is it Mario Galaxy?

2066
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:08,020
Oh, I never played Super Mario Galaxy.

2067
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:09,280
Yay!

2068
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:10,660
Alright, who wants to be the freak?

2069
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,040
It's a lot of freaky moves.

2070
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:20,400
Giant three-eyed spider.

2071
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:21,740
It's a spider?

2072
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:22,580
What?

2073
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:25,300
That does not look like a spider.

2074
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:28,400
And folklore is associated with outer space.

2075
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:30,940
It draws acid and crafts on...

2076
01:18:30,940 --> 01:18:31,720
Skippa, skippa.

2077
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:36,660
Made of an unusual sticky type silk.

2078
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:40,900
Alright.

2079
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:43,580
It's uglier...

2080
01:18:43,580 --> 01:18:44,700
This is him...

2081
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:45,340
Prettier?

2082
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:48,320
This is his glow up?

2083
01:18:52,690 --> 01:18:53,450
Alright.

2084
01:18:54,410 --> 01:18:55,430
You know what?

2085
01:18:56,170 --> 01:19:01,830
I'm gonna give it to 9-0 because he said it's uglier in Super Mario Galaxy.

2086
01:19:06,490 --> 01:19:08,350
9-0-goon.

2087
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:18,160
Alright, let's see.

2088
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:22,100
Are you the plumber lady, Pauline Contracted?

2089
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:23,980
It's not time someone showed up.

2090
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:24,780
Now listen up.

2091
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:27,220
Right now, there's no water coming out of the pipes.

2092
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:29,920
These vows make the water flow out of the pipes.

2093
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:30,940
Simple, right?

2094
01:19:30,940 --> 01:19:32,760
Sadly, it's not that easy.

2095
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:36,000
Members of the Cooper Troops are blocking access to vows.

2096
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:37,140
That's where you come in.

2097
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:40,060
Now get out there and don't disappoint lady, Pauline.

2098
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:40,520
Okay.

2099
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:42,820
I'll just grab these water out for now.

2100
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:44,320
Oh, and then I can...

2101
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:45,680
Oh, and then I can ride the shells.

2102
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:47,940
And I can also break this.

2103
01:19:52,060 --> 01:19:52,500
Alright.

2104
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:53,720
So I can swim.

2105
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:54,200
Swim!

2106
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:54,960
I swear to God.

2107
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,480
If I can stick fuck in the sewers, I swear to fucking God.

2108
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:58,820
What are you doing in the sewers?

2109
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:04,440
Alright, let's see if I can encounter any mons here first.

2110
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:07,560
Hello?

2111
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:08,920
Is there no mons?

2112
01:20:11,620 --> 01:20:12,920
Where are all the mons?

2113
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:16,320
Aw, it's a cheap chum.

2114
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,360
I think I already have enough in my club.

2115
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:23,240
Alright, let's see.

2116
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:25,140
I guess I can't encounter any here.

2117
01:20:31,150 --> 01:20:33,010
Okay, none of these are like...

2118
01:20:33,010 --> 01:20:34,810
None of these are like...

2119
01:20:34,810 --> 01:20:35,810
Mons I have...

2120
01:20:35,810 --> 01:20:36,530
I don't have.

2121
01:20:36,690 --> 01:20:36,950
Wait, what?

2122
01:20:36,970 --> 01:20:37,710
He won't let me leave?

2123
01:20:37,790 --> 01:20:38,310
Let me leave!

2124
01:20:38,910 --> 01:20:39,850
Okay, there you go.

2125
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:44,840
Orca, thank you, my super chat.

2126
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:45,180
Thank you.

2127
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:45,780
Thank you.

2128
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:49,100
I'm poor, but I bet my friend next week can afford this auction in my name.

2129
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:51,880
Name your price and she will pay.

2130
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,180
It's an auction.

2131
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:58,180
It can go to however amount it wants to go.

2132
01:20:58,380 --> 01:20:59,440
Thank you for the super chat.

2133
01:20:59,580 --> 01:21:00,260
Thank you, thank you.

2134
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:02,160
Mario, how'd you get down here?

2135
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:05,980
Nice birthday for fishing, huh?

2136
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:09,620
Alright, clubber.

2137
01:21:15,740 --> 01:21:17,180
Alright, get out of here.

2138
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:18,440
That's right.

2139
01:21:19,180 --> 01:21:20,300
Get out of here!

2140
01:21:20,420 --> 01:21:21,980
You think you could take on Dad?

2141
01:21:27,380 --> 01:21:28,700
Manny, thank you for the super chat.

2142
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:29,460
Thank you, thank you.

2143
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:33,740
Not Doki, ping, ping out Min for a chance to chuck her into the sun.

2144
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:36,380
I won't say pimping.

2145
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:38,060
I would say it's an investment.

2146
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:39,440
Thank you for the super chat.

2147
01:21:39,580 --> 01:21:40,360
Thank you, thank you.

2148
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:49,780
Yay!

2149
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,540
No, it's an investment, guys.

2150
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:55,160
It's different.

2151
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,200
Okay, I got water for this area.

2152
01:21:59,580 --> 01:21:59,980
Ba-dum.

2153
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:02,440
Ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum.

2154
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:05,160
Okay, tough puff.

2155
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:05,920
It's a cloud.

2156
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:11,180
Get out of here.

2157
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:15,640
Alright.

2158
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:19,340
Any new mods?

2159
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:20,840
Oh, it's spiked up!

2160
01:22:21,180 --> 01:22:21,360
Yay!

2161
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:26,540
Just as I was asking for new mods.

2162
01:22:29,420 --> 01:22:30,580
Oh, that was easy.

2163
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:31,100
Yay!

2164
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:32,320
Alright.

2165
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:34,500
It's upside down.

2166
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:36,960
It's like a little thumbtack.

2167
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:41,060
A turtle with a single large spike on its shell.

2168
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:42,920
The spike length indicates its status.

2169
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:46,060
It crawls on ceilings to ambush prey with a drop attack.

2170
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:48,480
Alright, who wants to be spiked up?

2171
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:51,800
Alright.

2172
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:52,720
Uh...

2173
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:54,520
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-da-dum.

2174
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:55,620
Ba-da-da-da-da-da.

2175
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:57,020
Yeah, he's such a little...

2176
01:22:57,020 --> 01:22:57,360
There he is.

2177
01:22:57,420 --> 01:22:59,960
He's like a little thumbtack that you want to just...

2178
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:02,080
Oh, it's like a spiky nipple.

2179
01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:09,660
Okay, let's see.

2180
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:11,520
Uh, I'll give it a blaze...

2181
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:11,620
Alright.

2182
01:23:15,180 --> 01:23:15,640
Blaze...

2183
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:18,760
Blaze...

2184
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:19,100
Ooh.

2185
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:20,100
Some...

2186
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:20,200
Wait.

2187
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:21,440
Oh, you get to be in a club.

2188
01:23:24,580 --> 01:23:25,040
Blaze...

2189
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:25,980
Good.

2190
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:33,100
I know some goons might be into that.

2191
01:23:33,660 --> 01:23:34,580
Alright, where are you?

2192
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:37,920
Oh, wait, yes!

2193
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:38,560
Yes!

2194
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:42,000
Yes!

2195
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:43,660
Okay, yeah, that's perfect actually.

2196
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:45,020
You're in the right spot.

2197
01:23:49,390 --> 01:23:50,970
Think you're fixing the pipes, eh?

2198
01:23:51,190 --> 01:23:52,490
Not on my watch.

2199
01:23:55,250 --> 01:23:56,290
The implication.

2200
01:23:58,450 --> 01:24:00,610
Doki, what do you mean by the implication?

2201
01:24:12,590 --> 01:24:13,650
Alright, yay!

2202
01:24:14,150 --> 01:24:14,770
It's so easy.

2203
01:24:14,930 --> 01:24:16,670
I actually looked away and just smashed A.

2204
01:24:17,430 --> 01:24:21,250
I literally just hydrated knowing that dad will finish the job.

2205
01:24:23,530 --> 01:24:24,990
I've never seen this guy before.

2206
01:24:27,870 --> 01:24:29,990
Doki, this is not right.

2207
01:24:30,210 --> 01:24:30,910
What do you mean?

2208
01:24:32,910 --> 01:24:34,750
Just bros being bros.

2209
01:24:41,170 --> 01:24:41,570
Yay!

2210
01:24:43,110 --> 01:24:45,250
How do I get to that side though?

2211
01:24:46,810 --> 01:24:47,110
Oh.

2212
01:24:48,350 --> 01:24:49,890
Okay, clearly there's a pipe.

2213
01:24:50,010 --> 01:24:50,150
Oh.

2214
01:24:50,430 --> 01:24:50,810
Here?

2215
01:24:51,390 --> 01:24:52,650
Oh no, it's on this side.

2216
01:24:52,750 --> 01:24:52,910
Okay.

2217
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:56,410
So then the water should be hot.

2218
01:24:56,530 --> 01:24:58,150
Oh, so now I get the other side of the water.

2219
01:24:59,450 --> 01:25:00,250
Going somewhere?

2220
01:25:06,430 --> 01:25:07,970
Oh, it's a nice star bag.

2221
01:25:08,150 --> 01:25:09,630
Okay, this guy actually hurts though.

2222
01:25:09,830 --> 01:25:10,590
Actually hurts dad.

2223
01:25:11,090 --> 01:25:12,310
Oh, he flattered me!

2224
01:25:12,450 --> 01:25:13,030
Never mind!

2225
01:25:13,410 --> 01:25:15,230
You're such a... you're such a cool guy.

2226
01:25:15,550 --> 01:25:15,890
Wow.

2227
01:25:16,230 --> 01:25:16,710
I know.

2228
01:25:17,110 --> 01:25:17,850
I know.

2229
01:25:18,310 --> 01:25:21,070
I'm just so amazing and awesome.

2230
01:25:21,070 --> 01:25:22,290
And wowee.

2231
01:25:22,930 --> 01:25:23,890
Wow, Doki.

2232
01:25:24,070 --> 01:25:26,510
You totally deserve a million subscribers.

2233
01:25:28,350 --> 01:25:28,810
Yay!

2234
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:36,180
A lubba?

2235
01:25:36,620 --> 01:25:37,600
What the fuck is that?

2236
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:41,120
Sit on it.

2237
01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:44,380
I don't know what it is, but I want you to sit on it.

2238
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:48,140
Jesus Christ, he's fucking tanky.

2239
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:51,300
That took like forever for the HP to go down.

2240
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:56,090
Okay, virus.

2241
01:26:03,670 --> 01:26:04,410
Acid armor?

2242
01:26:05,350 --> 01:26:06,670
Omni, thank you for the super chat.

2243
01:26:06,790 --> 01:26:07,550
Thank you, thank you.

2244
01:26:07,710 --> 01:26:09,090
About the auction and throw mint.

2245
01:26:09,310 --> 01:26:09,950
Like, geez.

2246
01:26:10,230 --> 01:26:11,730
Bowser and Super Mario 64.

2247
01:26:11,970 --> 01:26:13,370
Are you saying we only get to toss her once?

2248
01:26:13,610 --> 01:26:15,610
I mean, I could hold the auction every year.

2249
01:26:17,890 --> 01:26:19,150
It's like free money.

2250
01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:23,830
Thank you for the super chat.

2251
01:26:23,990 --> 01:26:24,870
Thank you, thank you.

2252
01:26:25,330 --> 01:26:25,450
Thank you.

2253
01:26:27,430 --> 01:26:28,250
Try attack?

2254
01:26:28,530 --> 01:26:29,150
What's it gonna do?

2255
01:26:29,330 --> 01:26:29,710
Oh, oh.

2256
01:26:29,910 --> 01:26:30,630
Oh, that's a...

2257
01:26:30,630 --> 01:26:30,870
Oh.

2258
01:26:33,150 --> 01:26:34,490
It does nothing still.

2259
01:26:35,650 --> 01:26:37,690
Yeah, it practically prints money.

2260
01:26:39,090 --> 01:26:40,470
It's just a business.

2261
01:26:47,140 --> 01:26:47,580
Okay.

2262
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:51,260
I mean, he lost.

2263
01:26:51,420 --> 01:26:52,100
Why are you laughing?

2264
01:26:52,620 --> 01:26:54,260
No, I'm too lazy to...

2265
01:26:54,260 --> 01:26:56,620
I'm too lazy to...

2266
01:26:58,100 --> 01:26:59,360
Go back to heal.

2267
01:26:59,540 --> 01:27:00,960
Go back to the Pokemon Center.

2268
01:27:01,260 --> 01:27:02,600
There has to be something that heals.

2269
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:04,480
What heals?

2270
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:05,420
Paralyze.

2271
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:08,440
What can...

2272
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:09,920
You know, paralyze stuff.

2273
01:27:10,540 --> 01:27:11,600
Electric seed.

2274
01:27:15,140 --> 01:27:16,120
Oh, full heal.

2275
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:17,160
I'll just use full heal.

2276
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:17,680
Fuck it.

2277
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:19,220
There you go.

2278
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:20,540
Next seed.

2279
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:21,560
Thank you for the super chat.

2280
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:21,900
Thank you.

2281
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:22,380
Thank you.

2282
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:23,080
It's Trophy.

2283
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:23,940
Absolutely.

2284
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:29,880
Oh my god.

2285
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:30,700
A fucking course.

2286
01:27:30,860 --> 01:27:31,620
It's a stick bug.

2287
01:27:31,820 --> 01:27:32,580
A fucking course.

2288
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:33,520
You'd like...

2289
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:34,900
This is like all you do.

2290
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:36,220
This is literally all you do.

2291
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:37,460
You have no life.

2292
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:44,380
Mario found the long thingy thing for...

2293
01:27:44,380 --> 01:27:44,760
Oh, nice.

2294
01:27:44,940 --> 01:27:46,080
It's a long thingy thing.

2295
01:27:46,860 --> 01:27:48,240
Get stick bugged.

2296
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:50,320
That's all it does.

2297
01:27:56,380 --> 01:27:57,300
Oh, wait.

2298
01:27:57,340 --> 01:27:58,420
I don't have Swoop?

2299
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:00,400
I thought I have him.

2300
01:28:00,940 --> 01:28:02,740
All I have is like baby brother.

2301
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:03,720
That's right.

2302
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:04,680
I have your baby brother.

2303
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:06,000
If you want to see him again.

2304
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:07,040
Y'all get in this cap.

2305
01:28:11,830 --> 01:28:12,290
Next seed.

2306
01:28:12,450 --> 01:28:13,010
Thank you for the super chat.

2307
01:28:13,110 --> 01:28:13,270
Thank you.

2308
01:28:13,390 --> 01:28:13,690
Thank you.

2309
01:28:13,830 --> 01:28:14,090
It's true.

2310
01:28:14,210 --> 01:28:16,310
I'll pay handsomely the throw mint.

2311
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:21,080
Yay.

2312
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:21,820
All right.

2313
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:22,760
Who wants to be Swoop?

2314
01:28:27,950 --> 01:28:29,910
Who wants to see their baby brother again?

2315
01:28:31,970 --> 01:28:32,290
Yay.

2316
01:28:33,790 --> 01:28:34,490
We're getting there.

2317
01:28:34,590 --> 01:28:35,510
We're almost at 50.

2318
01:28:37,450 --> 01:28:38,530
A noisy bat.

2319
01:28:38,530 --> 01:28:41,270
Its eyes are damaged from prolonged exposure to light.

2320
01:28:41,430 --> 01:28:42,890
It's a favorite's dark caves.

2321
01:28:43,250 --> 01:28:46,390
It produces a loud noise with powerful wing flaps.

2322
01:28:47,010 --> 01:28:47,490
All right.

2323
01:28:49,570 --> 01:28:50,470
Oh my god.

2324
01:28:51,110 --> 01:28:51,990
Come on, Dragoon.

2325
01:28:52,010 --> 01:28:53,050
Eat a little bit more.

2326
01:28:56,370 --> 01:28:57,550
Oh, you want to be the bat?

2327
01:28:57,690 --> 01:28:57,850
All right.

2328
01:29:00,330 --> 01:29:03,870
Okay, I hope you're not...

2329
01:29:03,870 --> 01:29:06,170
I hope you didn't trick me for getting two mons.

2330
01:29:06,170 --> 01:29:09,050
Because I actually forgot how many people I've named already.

2331
01:29:12,390 --> 01:29:13,470
Hey, where am I?

2332
01:29:15,910 --> 01:29:17,130
Oh, it's just like...

2333
01:29:17,130 --> 01:29:18,410
Oh, it's just more items.

2334
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:22,700
All right.

2335
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:23,460
Go back.

2336
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:23,500
Let's go.

2337
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:36,800
I love the music for this.

2338
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:38,160
Oh my god, already.

2339
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:39,920
He's just like...

2340
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:40,940
He's just lining up.

2341
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:41,720
They're like...

2342
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:43,680
It's my turn to fight Mario!

2343
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:52,620
All right.

2344
01:29:52,940 --> 01:29:54,360
I think it's this way.

2345
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:55,920
Oh my god, I already forgot where I was.

2346
01:29:56,060 --> 01:29:56,400
Oh, here.

2347
01:29:56,660 --> 01:29:57,740
Oh, but there's a free item.

2348
01:29:57,900 --> 01:29:58,780
I love free items.

2349
01:29:58,780 --> 01:30:00,100
Super Syrup.

2350
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:00,560
Yay!

2351
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:03,220
All right.

2352
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:03,740
Fight me.

2353
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:04,880
Oh, okay.

2354
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:05,400
Never mind.

2355
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:06,100
Give me a sec.

2356
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:07,020
I'm in a wild battle.

2357
01:30:08,300 --> 01:30:09,220
Not you!

2358
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:10,560
But like, that's all right.

2359
01:30:12,380 --> 01:30:13,000
All right.

2360
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:14,040
Now fight me.

2361
01:30:15,860 --> 01:30:17,360
Enemy spotted while on patrol.

2362
01:30:17,660 --> 01:30:18,400
Engaging now.

2363
01:30:25,340 --> 01:30:26,340
Mr. Blizzard.

2364
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:27,420
Ooh.

2365
01:30:29,020 --> 01:30:29,720
All right.

2366
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:32,980
Warm up those cheeks, dad.

2367
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:35,160
Yay!

2368
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:39,080
Oh yeah, dad's coming home in like...

2369
01:30:39,820 --> 01:30:40,220
Uh...

2370
01:30:40,220 --> 01:30:40,820
Three hours.

2371
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:41,600
Yay!

2372
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:43,080
We get to see dad.

2373
01:30:45,700 --> 01:30:48,780
Oh, I have some cute videos that the dog sitter sent me, guys.

2374
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:49,760
I'll show that later.

2375
01:30:50,300 --> 01:30:53,220
I wanted to show a lot of stuff today, but like...

2376
01:30:53,220 --> 01:30:56,640
But like, I literally got back and then like, went to stream.

2377
01:30:58,100 --> 01:30:58,740
Sorry.

2378
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:01,080
I couldn't prep anything at all.

2379
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:06,840
I literally got back and just went straight to stream.

2380
01:31:12,380 --> 01:31:12,860
All right.

2381
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:14,900
Get out of here, sumo bro!

2382
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:18,780
Yay!

2383
01:31:18,780 --> 01:31:18,800
Yay!

2384
01:31:21,140 --> 01:31:22,360
Oh wait, metronome?

2385
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:23,540
Okay, that's a shitty move.

2386
01:31:23,660 --> 01:31:23,940
Get out.

2387
01:31:24,100 --> 01:31:25,140
Get that move out of here.

2388
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:26,760
That's too RNG for me.

2389
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:28,880
I'd like to know what's gonna happen.

2390
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:31,600
Stop!

2391
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,560
Lord, Bowser has restricted access to this pipe.

2392
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,220
Well, I can't read, so I'm gonna go in anyway.

2393
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:40,260
Oh, he only has one fucking...

2394
01:31:41,260 --> 01:31:41,820
Mon?

2395
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:43,060
Bro, what the fuck?

2396
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:44,460
You're fighting Mario and you...

2397
01:31:44,460 --> 01:31:44,880
Oh shit.

2398
01:31:46,040 --> 01:31:48,500
You're fighting Mario and you brought one move?

2399
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:53,280
That's what's wrong with you.

2400
01:32:01,430 --> 01:32:01,990
Yay!

2401
01:32:02,770 --> 01:32:03,750
That's what you get.

2402
01:32:04,110 --> 01:32:06,430
That's what you get for bringing one fucking move.

2403
01:32:06,630 --> 01:32:08,510
Okay, did we catch all the mons in the sewers?

2404
01:32:09,570 --> 01:32:10,710
I can't tell.

2405
01:32:12,510 --> 01:32:13,750
Bro thought he was him.

2406
01:32:13,890 --> 01:32:14,050
I know.

2407
01:32:14,150 --> 01:32:16,630
Bro thought he was gonna be the one that beats Mario.

2408
01:32:17,830 --> 01:32:18,770
What did he do?

2409
01:32:19,150 --> 01:32:20,330
He momentumed me.

2410
01:32:23,150 --> 01:32:24,270
What is my...

2411
01:32:24,270 --> 01:32:24,930
Wait, what?

2412
01:32:25,050 --> 01:32:25,690
He died?

2413
01:32:26,230 --> 01:32:26,430
What?

2414
01:32:26,930 --> 01:32:27,910
What did he...

2415
01:32:27,910 --> 01:32:29,390
What did he do?

2416
01:32:30,250 --> 01:32:30,690
Alright.

2417
01:32:31,190 --> 01:32:32,470
Thank you for the super chat.

2418
01:32:32,650 --> 01:32:33,530
Thank you, thank you.

2419
01:32:34,490 --> 01:32:34,930
Oh!

2420
01:32:35,290 --> 01:32:35,950
Chain Chomp!

2421
01:32:36,290 --> 01:32:36,690
Yes!

2422
01:32:37,410 --> 01:32:38,370
Okay, nice.

2423
01:32:38,470 --> 01:32:39,170
That's good, that's good.

2424
01:32:40,710 --> 01:32:41,190
Oh my god.

2425
01:32:41,250 --> 01:32:42,710
This has to be one of the rare encounters.

2426
01:32:42,910 --> 01:32:44,570
Because I haven't seen a Chain Chomp before.

2427
01:32:44,850 --> 01:32:45,610
Like, in the wild.

2428
01:32:47,610 --> 01:32:49,070
What is my clown ass lures?

2429
01:32:49,190 --> 01:32:50,990
At least I got Shadow Ball.

2430
01:32:51,130 --> 01:32:51,730
Oh my god!

2431
01:32:51,830 --> 01:32:52,090
Nice!

2432
01:32:52,190 --> 01:32:52,950
I don't have to try.

2433
01:32:53,670 --> 01:32:54,750
Thank you for the super chat.

2434
01:32:54,890 --> 01:32:55,550
Thank you, thank you.

2435
01:32:55,830 --> 01:32:57,550
Alright, I'm auctioning Chain Chomp out.

2436
01:32:57,550 --> 01:32:58,310
I'm...

2437
01:32:59,630 --> 01:33:00,270
I'm...

2438

This is my test run auction.

2439
01:33:02,310 --> 01:33:05,030
I know everybody wants to be a Chain Chomp.

2440
01:33:05,230 --> 01:33:06,650
A living wrecking ball.

2441
01:33:06,830 --> 01:33:08,650
Its loyalty to his trainer is unmatched.

2442
01:33:09,530 --> 01:33:14,470
Its leash is made of the strongest magnets known to exist in nature.

2443
01:33:17,650 --> 01:33:18,730
First try.

2444
01:33:19,370 --> 01:33:20,430
Alright, Chain Chomp is out.

2445
01:33:20,810 --> 01:33:20,830
First try.

2446
01:33:20,990 --> 01:33:31,970
I should be another dad.

2447
01:33:31,970 --> 01:33:36,190
No, dad is already perfect as he is.

2448
01:33:36,990 --> 01:33:40,030
I don't want to be that dog.

2449
01:33:41,590 --> 01:33:43,770
Oh my god, look at this fucking sprite, though.

2450
01:33:43,890 --> 01:33:44,730
He's like, hi.

2451
01:33:47,950 --> 01:33:49,530
He's like, hi.

2452
01:33:49,870 --> 01:33:51,330
It's really chinchom.

2453
01:33:57,970 --> 01:33:59,050
I'll be the girl.

2454
01:34:02,510 --> 01:34:04,310
He's going into the club.

2455
01:34:05,670 --> 01:34:07,490
Mehdi, Mehdi, you're ready.

2456
01:34:07,870 --> 01:34:08,410
You're ready.

2457
01:34:08,670 --> 01:34:10,630
You already have one.

2458
01:34:10,890 --> 01:34:12,410
And he's a good one, too.

2459
01:34:13,410 --> 01:34:14,650
Mehdi, you can't change your fate.

2460
01:34:15,010 --> 01:34:16,210
It was your destiny.

2461
01:34:19,410 --> 01:34:22,010
You can't change your destiny, Mehdi.

2462
01:34:22,170 --> 01:34:23,490
You have a child.

2463
01:34:23,870 --> 01:34:26,350
Think about your child, Mehdi.

2464
01:34:26,770 --> 01:34:31,210
But you can nominate a friend who has not yet been named.

2465
01:34:35,990 --> 01:34:37,790
You're a mom, Mehdi!

2466
01:34:38,610 --> 01:34:39,690
You can't just abandon.

2467
01:34:40,770 --> 01:34:42,950
Kida, thank you for the super chat.

2468
01:34:42,950 --> 01:34:44,370

01:37:28,370 --> 01:37:29,470
Let's go.

2568
01:37:34,590 --> 01:37:36,610
Congratulations to the auction winner!

2569
01:37:37,870 --> 01:37:39,910
And you're placed in the Goon Cave.

2570
01:37:40,290 --> 01:37:40,550
Alright.

2571
01:37:40,630 --> 01:37:42,230
Let me rearrange this.

2572
01:37:42,970 --> 01:37:43,250
Alright.

2573
01:37:43,810 --> 01:37:44,250
Wait, Hefli.

2574
01:37:44,270 --> 01:37:44,790
Are you still?

2575
01:37:45,170 --> 01:37:45,930
Oh, we have fly.

2576
01:37:46,350 --> 01:37:46,590
Oh, wait.

2577
01:37:46,610 --> 01:37:48,050
I can actually fly with you.

2578
01:37:48,530 --> 01:37:48,930
Alright.

2579
01:37:49,030 --> 01:37:49,550
Let's see.

2580
01:37:51,070 --> 01:37:52,190
You are...

2581
01:37:53,430 --> 01:37:53,990
Okay.

2582
01:37:54,110 --> 01:37:54,730
Still fly.

2583
01:37:54,890 --> 01:37:55,450
That sucks.

2584
01:37:55,550 --> 01:37:56,330
Cause like...

2585
01:37:57,090 --> 01:38:00,350
Cause like, if I didn't have Lactiku, I would put you in my party.

2586
01:38:00,650 --> 01:38:01,130
Hahaha!

2587
01:38:02,050 --> 01:38:03,010
It's so funny.

2588
01:38:03,350 --> 01:38:04,250
Thank you for the super chat.

2589
01:38:04,410 --> 01:38:04,710
Thank you.

2590
01:38:04,930 --> 01:38:05,450
Thank you.

2591
01:38:06,030 --> 01:38:06,390
Alright.

2592
01:38:07,350 --> 01:38:07,870
Let's see.

2593
01:38:07,870 --> 01:38:09,710
I'll put you in...

2594
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:13,560
Okay.

2595
01:38:21,150 --> 01:38:21,630
Alright.

2596
01:38:27,430 --> 01:38:28,530
Oh, sorry.

2597
01:38:28,670 --> 01:38:31,670
I can't... There's not enough... There's not enough... Okay.

2598
01:38:32,830 --> 01:38:33,870
There's not...

2599
01:38:35,030 --> 01:38:35,550
Okay.

2600
01:38:37,150 --> 01:38:37,670
Um...

2601
01:38:39,070 --> 01:38:39,890
Let's see.

2602
01:38:42,390 --> 01:38:42,910
Fun...

2603
01:38:44,090 --> 01:38:46,690
F-U-N-I-S-L-E-N-D... Okay.

2604
01:38:46,810 --> 01:38:46,930
Yeah.

2605
01:38:46,970 --> 01:38:47,290
It works.

2606
01:38:48,130 --> 01:38:48,650
Alright.

2607
01:38:48,770 --> 01:38:49,230
Here we go.

2608
01:38:49,530 --> 01:38:50,010
Don't worry.

2609
01:38:50,010 --> 01:38:50,030
Here.

2610
01:38:50,290 --> 01:38:52,330
This is a new... New area.

2611
01:38:52,530 --> 01:38:53,510
This is a new island.

2612
01:38:54,090 --> 01:38:56,230
I'll call it...

2613
01:38:57,130 --> 01:38:58,550
Fun Island.

2614
01:39:02,060 --> 01:39:04,720
Where everyone has so much fun.

2615
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:06,580
Alright.

2616
01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:07,420
Fun Island.

2617
01:39:07,900 --> 01:39:08,740
Let's get...

2618
01:39:08,740 --> 01:39:09,100
Hahaha!

2619
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:12,660
He failed.

2620
01:39:12,860 --> 01:39:13,820
No, no, no!

2621
01:39:14,100 --> 01:39:16,180
He didn't just get boxed.

2622
01:39:16,260 --> 01:39:18,380
He gets to be in the goon cave.

2623
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:19,340
Hahaha!

2624
01:39:19,340 --> 01:39:19,520
Hahaha!

2625
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:23,300
Alright.

2626
01:39:23,300 --> 01:39:23,760
Alright.

2627
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:24,240
Alright.

2628
01:39:24,240 --> 01:39:24,480
And...

2629
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:25,380
And I'll let him...

2630
01:39:25,380 --> 01:39:26,000
Alright, B-B-B!

2631
01:39:26,460 --> 01:39:27,460
I'll let you pick.

2632
01:39:27,460 --> 01:39:28,680
Who do you want...

2633
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:29,560
On the fun...

2634
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:30,340
Who do you want...

2635
01:39:31,100 --> 01:39:32,340
To have fun with?

2636
01:39:32,820 --> 01:39:33,120
Hahaha!

2637
01:39:33,680 --> 01:39:34,460
At the club!

2638
01:39:35,260 --> 01:39:35,640
You know what?

2639
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:36,260
Maybe...

2640
01:39:36,260 --> 01:39:37,000
You know what?

2641
01:39:38,020 --> 01:39:38,480
He's...

2642
01:39:39,900 --> 01:39:40,800
There you go.

2643
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:41,120
There you go.

2644
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:42,300
You guys get to have fun.

2645
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:43,500
Hahaha!

2646
01:39:45,860 --> 01:39:46,340
Hahaha!

2647
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:49,460
You get a pick.

2648
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:50,500
You get to pick!

2649
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:51,320
B-B-B!

2650
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:52,700
For now I gave you...

2651
01:39:52,700 --> 01:39:53,900
I gave you...

2652
01:39:53,900 --> 01:39:55,460
I gave you...

2653
01:39:55,460 --> 01:39:57,340
I have a spoon for now, but you get to pick if you want.

2654
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:03,160
Here are all the beautiful choices.

2655
01:40:03,340 --> 01:40:03,900
You know what?

2656
01:40:04,740 --> 01:40:08,640
There's so many squishy stuff that you can chomp here.

2657
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:10,100
Here you go.

2658
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:11,000
You can choose.

2659
01:40:13,860 --> 01:40:15,520
Yeah, I'm thinking about the super chat.

2660
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:16,140
Thank you, thank you.

2661
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:17,900
Look at all the options.

2662
01:40:18,100 --> 01:40:20,000
A variety you can chomp on.

2663
01:40:20,260 --> 01:40:20,900
Look at that.

2664
01:40:27,210 --> 01:40:28,250
Alright, let's go in.

2665
01:40:29,050 --> 01:40:32,450
Okay, let me roll around and see if there's any more...

2666
01:40:32,450 --> 01:40:34,670
Any more mons for me to catch?

2667
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:40,420
Any victim is not...

2668
01:40:43,260 --> 01:40:45,360
Okay, then I think I made a good choice.

2669
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:49,520
I think I made a... I think I made a good choice then.

2670
01:40:57,940 --> 01:40:58,560
You know what?

2671
01:40:58,700 --> 01:41:00,660
Just because you won the auction...

2672
01:41:00,660 --> 01:41:01,920
I'll let you out.

2673
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:03,300
For one battle.

2674
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:06,640
Alright, Heathley.

2675
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:09,080
You can have some fun, too.

2676
01:41:11,020 --> 01:41:11,780
Here you go.

2677
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:14,240
I gave you a Q-goon.

2678
01:41:15,080 --> 01:41:16,460
Joki-can, please come out of the box.

2679
01:41:16,580 --> 01:41:17,940
They make me clean the floor of my...

2680
01:41:23,330 --> 01:41:25,190
Thank you for the super chat, simple-minded.

2681
01:41:25,330 --> 01:41:26,170
Thank you, thank you.

2682
01:41:27,470 --> 01:41:27,910
Sorry.

2683
01:41:29,210 --> 01:41:33,870
Only one... Only one goon can be out of the box once a month.

2684
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:42,660
You guys gotta share that.

2685
01:41:44,180 --> 01:41:44,600
Hello.

2686
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:45,880
Talk to me.

2687
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:48,840
The sewers aren't so bad.

2688
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:51,340
There's space to run around like I just don't care!

2689
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:51,960
Wahoo!

2690
01:41:55,030 --> 01:41:56,090
What do you mean fail?

2691
01:41:56,250 --> 01:41:57,030
It's a fun time!

2692
01:41:57,250 --> 01:41:59,090
Why would you ever want to leave the cave?

2693
01:42:01,810 --> 01:42:03,950
I worked so hard for you guys.

2694
01:42:04,330 --> 01:42:06,310
Providing for all of you in the cave.

2695
01:42:07,190 --> 01:42:08,750
To keep that cave running.

2696
01:42:15,330 --> 01:42:17,050
I can't believe you're complaining.

2697
01:42:22,540 --> 01:42:23,280
Oh my god.

2698
01:42:23,420 --> 01:42:24,120
Let me leave!

2699
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:24,940
Sick bug!

2700
01:42:25,860 --> 01:42:27,220
Let me leave!

2701
01:42:32,260 --> 01:42:33,280
I swear to god.

2702
01:42:33,420 --> 01:42:34,060
I swear to god.

2703
01:42:34,160 --> 01:42:35,360
I'm gonna fucking sit on this.

2704
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:38,160
Like...

2705
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:42,240
What do you get out of this?

2706
01:42:42,360 --> 01:42:43,180
You're just gonna...

2707
01:42:43,180 --> 01:42:43,880
Oh my god.

2708
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:44,620
You're so lucky.

2709
01:42:44,900 --> 01:42:45,760
You're so lucky.

2710
01:42:45,860 --> 01:42:46,760
There's no more pee pee.

2711
01:42:49,820 --> 01:42:51,000
Get out of here.

2712
01:42:53,980 --> 01:42:55,280
That's how weak you are!

2713
01:42:55,460 --> 01:42:58,840
I literally can just one-shot you on a move that's not very effective.

2714
01:43:00,620 --> 01:43:01,960
Nira, thank you for the super chat.

2715
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:02,280
Thank you.

2716
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:02,940
Thank you.

2717
01:43:05,180 --> 01:43:06,340
Yeah, do you like your...

2718
01:43:06,340 --> 01:43:07,260
Do you like fun island?

2719
01:43:07,560 --> 01:43:08,420
It's so fun.

2720
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:12,960
I forgot.

2721
01:43:13,140 --> 01:43:14,200
Was there anything back there?

2722
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:15,320
Or was I just...

2723
01:43:18,160 --> 01:43:19,420
Was I seeing things?

2724
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:23,200
Okay, I was seeing things.

2725
01:43:23,200 --> 01:43:23,420
I was...

2726
01:43:23,420 --> 01:43:24,880
I gotta go this way then.

2727
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:26,760
Maybe Bowser will heal me.

2728
01:43:27,460 --> 01:43:27,860
Maybe Bowser will heal me.

2729
01:43:27,860 --> 01:43:29,540
He's known to be like a good person, right?

2730
01:43:33,980 --> 01:43:35,240
Alright, let's see.

2731
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:36,400
Oh!

2732
01:43:36,580 --> 01:43:37,600
Wait, I didn't see that guy!

2733
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:38,780
You didn't see me?

2734
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:39,560
Oh yeah, I...

2735
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:40,960
Yeah, I definitely didn't.

2736
01:43:46,410 --> 01:43:47,210
Alright, fishbone.

2737
01:43:47,670 --> 01:43:48,090
Oh wait!

2738
01:43:49,090 --> 01:43:50,170
I don't think I can...

2739
01:43:51,430 --> 01:43:52,450
Can I hit him?

2740
01:43:54,770 --> 01:43:56,150
I can't hit him, right?

2741
01:43:56,490 --> 01:43:57,270
Oh no.

2742
01:43:58,990 --> 01:44:00,090
I don't think I can.

2743
01:44:01,690 --> 01:44:03,090
Alright, I'll send in...

2744
01:44:03,790 --> 01:44:05,090
Yeah, he's a ghost.

2745
01:44:07,830 --> 01:44:09,490
Okay, I'll send in the dinosaur.

2746
01:44:11,110 --> 01:44:11,630
Yeah.

2747
01:44:13,210 --> 01:44:15,070
I was gonna say, he's a ghost.

2748
01:44:19,780 --> 01:44:21,500
Alright, I'll just hit him with my tail.

2749
01:44:22,580 --> 01:44:23,360
Dragon tail!

2750
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:25,720
Okay, fucker.

2751
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:27,660
Alright, move abuser.

2752
01:44:30,120 --> 01:44:31,000
It's not fair.

2753
01:44:31,220 --> 01:44:32,840
He's faster than a dinosaur!

2754
01:44:33,640 --> 01:44:34,760
It's not fair!

2755
01:44:38,840 --> 01:44:40,060
Get out of here!

2756
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:41,620
You fucking fish!

2757
01:44:47,460 --> 01:44:48,720
Alright, what's next?

2758
01:44:49,480 --> 01:44:49,760
Evil?

2759
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:51,380
That's right.

2760
01:44:52,420 --> 01:44:53,240
Try to heave me?

2761
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:54,980
Say that to my...

2762
01:44:54,980 --> 01:44:56,340
Oh wait, you're stronger than the tail.

2763
01:44:56,440 --> 01:44:56,840
Never mind.

2764
01:44:59,320 --> 01:44:59,740
What?

2765
01:44:59,900 --> 01:45:00,720
Who did he send out?

2766
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:01,840
Oh my god, get stick bug.

2767
01:45:02,140 --> 01:45:02,300
Alright.

2768
01:45:04,860 --> 01:45:05,560
Of course.

2769
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:07,660
I was like, who did he send out?

2770
01:45:07,740 --> 01:45:09,080
Oh, the fucking stick bug.

2771
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:16,100
That sucker punch.

2772
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:17,680
Oh, I don't know what it does.

2773
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:18,100
Alright.

2774
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:21,360
Okay guys, was that obvious?

2775
01:45:21,480 --> 01:45:22,780
I didn't know what sucker punch did?

2776
01:45:24,660 --> 01:45:25,740
Get stick bug.

2777
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:27,700
Yeah!

2778
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:35,100
Okay, who did he send?

2779
01:45:35,240 --> 01:45:35,440
Alright.

2780
01:45:35,740 --> 01:45:36,120
That's good.

2781
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:38,820
That's how I always want to end my battles.

2782
01:45:41,540 --> 01:45:43,040
Only does that little damage?

2783
01:45:43,220 --> 01:45:43,780
That's okay.

2784
01:45:44,020 --> 01:45:45,440
It's about sending a message.

2785
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:46,760
It's...

2786
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:50,540
Oh shit, never mind.

2787
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:52,580
Let me actually make you use a real move.

2788
01:45:52,820 --> 01:45:53,940
Never mind, you might die.

2789
01:46:00,260 --> 01:46:01,480
My surprise attack.

2790
01:46:01,960 --> 01:46:02,440
Worthless!

2791
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:04,680
That's fucking right.

2792
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:12,580
You're so lucky dad doesn't have any more PP and heat crush.

2793
01:46:12,820 --> 01:46:13,240
Oh!

2794
01:46:14,340 --> 01:46:16,260
He's from Luigi's Mansion!

2795
01:46:17,160 --> 01:46:18,900
Oh, this has to be a rare encounter.

2796
01:46:19,120 --> 01:46:20,260
I haven't seen this guy before.

2797
01:46:20,660 --> 01:46:21,000
At all.

2798
01:46:23,380 --> 01:46:25,060
Yeah, Luigi Mansion Ghost.

2799
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:27,600
Oh my god, that's a lot.

2800
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:28,700
Okay, let me...

2801
01:46:28,700 --> 01:46:29,440
Alright, goodbye.

2802
01:46:33,820 --> 01:46:35,120
What level is he?

2803
01:46:36,780 --> 01:46:38,680
Your sacrifice will not be in vain.

2804
01:46:42,540 --> 01:46:44,320
Don't worry, BB Coot.

2805
01:46:45,580 --> 01:46:47,960
Your sacrifice will not be in vain.

2806
01:46:54,760 --> 01:46:55,840
You just can't...

2807
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:56,580
You're here to...

2808
01:46:56,580 --> 01:46:57,220
Look at that.

2809
01:46:57,300 --> 01:46:58,600
You're here to protect dad.

2810
01:46:58,600 --> 01:46:59,920
What a great honor.

2811
01:47:00,140 --> 01:47:00,560
Look at that!

2812
01:47:00,740 --> 01:47:00,900
See?

2813
01:47:01,300 --> 01:47:02,240
I told you!

2814
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:02,780
You live!

2815
01:47:03,580 --> 01:47:04,720
You guys didn't believe.

2816
01:47:05,100 --> 01:47:07,320
I saw you guys saying, Bye, BB Goon.

2817
01:47:07,540 --> 01:47:08,580
You didn't believe.

2818
01:47:14,630 --> 01:47:20,270
A large ghost is known to strike the floor, making a racket and creating a shockwave attack.

2819
01:47:20,610 --> 01:47:23,510
Strangely, as a fear of high-isode vacuum cleaners.

2820
01:47:23,650 --> 01:47:25,070
Alright, who wants to be a...

2821
01:47:26,050 --> 01:47:26,530
Twirler?

2822
01:47:28,690 --> 01:47:30,410
From Luigi Mansion.

2823
01:47:36,530 --> 01:47:37,230
Alright.

2824
01:47:37,690 --> 01:47:38,570
Who has not...

2825
01:47:38,570 --> 01:47:40,210
Who has not been named yet?

2826
01:47:42,160 --> 01:47:43,150
Let's see...

2827
01:47:45,890 --> 01:47:47,750
Alright, just cause you said please.

2828
01:47:50,930 --> 01:47:51,630
Alright.

2829
01:47:52,430 --> 01:47:53,130
Welsh.

2830
01:47:54,330 --> 01:47:55,690
Oh my god, he's Welsh too.

2831
01:47:57,270 --> 01:47:57,970
Goon.

2832
01:47:59,190 --> 01:47:59,890
Alright.

2833
01:48:00,390 --> 01:48:01,710
I was placed in the Goon cave.

2834
01:48:04,110 --> 01:48:05,450
Okay, we got a helmet cap.

2835
01:48:07,290 --> 01:48:08,410
Can I turn this on?

2836
01:48:08,610 --> 01:48:09,190
Oh, I can.

2837
01:48:09,350 --> 01:48:09,570
Nice.

2838
01:48:12,830 --> 01:48:14,750
I dropped to my knees.

2839
01:48:18,290 --> 01:48:20,110
Oh wait, there's like a puzzle over there.

2840
01:48:20,330 --> 01:48:21,350
It's a fucking stick bug.

2841
01:48:22,190 --> 01:48:23,390
God, dammit.

2842
01:48:23,510 --> 01:48:25,430
Okay, dad is like hanging by the thread right now.

2843
01:48:30,220 --> 01:48:30,660
Oh.

2844
01:48:31,300 --> 01:48:32,980
Oh, I found the short gizmo thing.

2845
01:48:33,340 --> 01:48:34,280
Okay, I might have to heal him.

2846
01:48:34,460 --> 01:48:35,220
I don't think I'm gonna get...

2847
01:48:35,220 --> 01:48:35,920
Have like...

2848
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:37,640
I don't think I'm gonna find any extra heals.

2849
01:48:40,580 --> 01:48:41,760
Do I have heals?

2850
01:48:43,860 --> 01:48:44,440
Paralyzed heal.

2851
01:48:44,500 --> 01:48:45,360
Oh, I have paralyzed heal.

2852
01:48:45,460 --> 01:48:45,680
Whoops.

2853
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:46,840
Whoops.

2854
01:48:47,140 --> 01:48:47,940
Okay, that's awkward.

2855
01:48:48,680 --> 01:48:49,400
Oh, there you go.

2856
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:50,140
Max mushroom.

2857
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:50,500
Alright.

2858
01:48:51,140 --> 01:48:51,660
Nice.

2859
01:48:53,700 --> 01:48:56,320
I swear to God, if I bump into a...

2860
01:48:57,040 --> 01:48:58,500
If I bump into a...

2861
01:48:59,080 --> 01:49:00,560
A toad, that's like...

2862
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:01,640
Let me heal you real quick.

2863
01:49:01,700 --> 01:49:02,860
I swear to fucking God.

2864
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:04,860
Oh no.

2865
01:49:05,120 --> 01:49:06,620
Mario actually got here?

2866
01:49:12,210 --> 01:49:13,270
Okay, jabby.

2867
01:49:13,550 --> 01:49:14,730
This guy fucking suck.

2868
01:49:14,810 --> 01:49:15,350
I hate that guy.

2869
01:49:16,410 --> 01:49:18,490
This guy took like...

2870
01:49:18,490 --> 01:49:19,930
25 balls to like...

2871
01:49:19,930 --> 01:49:20,930
Oh, it's not very effective?

2872
01:49:21,090 --> 01:49:21,350
No.

2873
01:49:22,290 --> 01:49:22,650
No!

2874
01:49:23,150 --> 01:49:24,430
I just healed you!

2875
01:49:25,210 --> 01:49:25,930
Okay.

2876
01:49:26,470 --> 01:49:26,970
Bryce.

2877
01:49:28,210 --> 01:49:28,570
Um...

2878
01:49:28,930 --> 01:49:29,310
Ooh.

2879
01:49:29,710 --> 01:49:30,850
You have like...

2880
01:49:30,850 --> 01:49:32,110
A very interesting moveset.

2881
01:49:34,090 --> 01:49:34,630
Child ball.

2882
01:49:34,770 --> 01:49:35,010
Yay!

2883
01:49:35,610 --> 01:49:35,850
Wait!

2884
01:49:36,110 --> 01:49:36,490
No!

2885
01:49:36,770 --> 01:49:37,070
Wait!

2886
01:49:37,070 --> 01:49:37,310
I...

2887
01:49:37,310 --> 01:49:38,030
I...

2888
01:49:38,030 --> 01:49:40,270
Anytime I feel confident.

2889
01:49:41,530 --> 01:49:41,910
Alright.

2890
01:49:42,030 --> 01:49:42,610
Dream punch.

2891
01:49:44,350 --> 01:49:45,370
Every time.

2892
01:49:45,650 --> 01:49:47,370
Every time I start believing.

2893
01:49:49,150 --> 01:49:49,750
Okay.

2894
01:49:49,810 --> 01:49:50,150
Goodbye.

2895
01:49:50,510 --> 01:49:51,550
Is that all he knows?

2896
01:49:51,850 --> 01:49:53,470
Is that actually all he knows?

2897
01:49:53,610 --> 01:49:54,010
Does he...

2898
01:49:54,010 --> 01:49:55,830
He just knows how to whirlwind.

2899
01:49:56,490 --> 01:49:57,530
Get stick pug.

2900
01:50:00,270 --> 01:50:00,870
Alright.

2901
01:50:01,110 --> 01:50:02,030
Just stomp him.

2902
01:50:02,430 --> 01:50:04,230
He's just living by a thread now.

2903
01:50:10,050 --> 01:50:11,030
What is this?

2904
01:50:11,150 --> 01:50:11,790
Striker smack?

2905
01:50:12,090 --> 01:50:13,330
He's literally just a mascot.

2906
01:50:13,670 --> 01:50:14,130
So like...

2907
01:50:14,130 --> 01:50:15,750
Does it really matter what move he has?

2908
01:50:16,630 --> 01:50:17,390
Skitter smack.

2909
01:50:17,930 --> 01:50:19,250
These are skitters behind foes.

2910
01:50:19,390 --> 01:50:19,650
Lower...

2911
01:50:19,650 --> 01:50:19,870
Okay.

2912
01:50:19,970 --> 01:50:20,070
Yeah.

2913
01:50:20,130 --> 01:50:20,990
Let's get bite out of here.

2914
01:50:21,830 --> 01:50:23,750
You're just a mascot stick pug.

2915
01:50:23,970 --> 01:50:24,410
Like...

2916
01:50:24,410 --> 01:50:26,110
You have no purpose on my team.

2917
01:50:26,670 --> 01:50:26,730
Yeah.

2918
01:50:30,650 --> 01:50:31,170
Banto.

2919
01:50:31,670 --> 01:50:32,050
Okay.

2920
01:50:32,410 --> 01:50:32,930
That's...

2921
01:50:32,930 --> 01:50:33,330
Ghost.

2922
01:50:33,910 --> 01:50:34,650
That's be ghost.

2923
01:50:36,290 --> 01:50:36,950
Oh yeah.

2924
01:50:36,990 --> 01:50:37,610
It's a mask.

2925
01:50:41,370 --> 01:50:42,210
Can't have...

2926
01:50:42,210 --> 01:50:42,670
Oh shit.

2927
01:50:42,830 --> 01:50:42,930
Wait.

2928
01:50:43,230 --> 01:50:43,670
Doesn't...

2929
01:50:43,670 --> 01:50:44,570
Oh fuck.

2930
01:50:44,830 --> 01:50:45,010
Okay.

2931
01:50:45,810 --> 01:50:46,510
Oh shit.

2932
01:50:46,510 --> 01:50:46,770
No.

2933
01:50:46,990 --> 01:50:47,150
Wait.

2934
01:50:47,770 --> 01:50:49,490
I can stomp on him.

2935
01:50:49,710 --> 01:50:50,030
Nice.

2936
01:50:51,610 --> 01:50:52,670
We crunch him too.

2937
01:50:53,390 --> 01:50:53,750
Okay.

2938
01:50:53,810 --> 01:50:55,030
What are your move sets?

2939
01:50:55,370 --> 01:50:56,350
They do nothing.

2940
01:50:57,190 --> 01:50:58,370
Oh, it's not very effective.

2941
01:50:58,530 --> 01:50:58,670
Okay.

2942
01:50:59,310 --> 01:51:00,430
Oh, now they do something.

2943
01:51:02,870 --> 01:51:04,290
Oh, it's dark fairy.

2944
01:51:04,590 --> 01:51:04,790
Oh.

2945
01:51:05,310 --> 01:51:06,570
I thought it was like a little...

2946
01:51:06,570 --> 01:51:07,350
It was a ghost.

2947
01:51:07,530 --> 01:51:08,410
Because it says Banto.

2948
01:51:10,890 --> 01:51:12,910
Can I bribe you to fix Rice's moveset?

2949
01:51:13,010 --> 01:51:13,910
I feel bad for him.

2950
01:51:13,970 --> 01:51:14,830
Thank you for the super chat.

2951
01:51:15,250 --> 01:51:15,610
Nextie.

2952
01:51:15,710 --> 01:51:15,950
Thank you.

2953
01:51:16,090 --> 01:51:16,450
Thank you.

2954
01:51:16,750 --> 01:51:20,590
I can't fix something that's sort of already...

2955
01:51:20,590 --> 01:51:21,590
Like, unfair...

2956
01:51:24,850 --> 01:51:26,550
It's not my fault.

2957
01:51:26,550 --> 01:51:29,070
He doesn't have the moveset.

2958
01:51:29,230 --> 01:51:29,710
I...

2959
01:51:29,710 --> 01:51:30,170
I...

2960
01:51:30,170 --> 01:51:31,150
What can I do?

2961
01:51:31,430 --> 01:51:32,770
Like, what can I...

2962
01:51:35,470 --> 01:51:37,750
Like, that's all they have.

2963
01:51:37,990 --> 01:51:39,350
That's all the moves they have.

2964
01:51:39,510 --> 01:51:40,330
What can I do?

2965
01:51:41,510 --> 01:51:44,270
Okay, it's 75% accuracy though.

2966
01:51:44,330 --> 01:51:45,690
So I don't know if that's worth it.

2967
01:51:46,010 --> 01:51:48,190
But it does have 100% power.

2968
01:51:50,570 --> 01:51:51,530
Swings tail...

2969
01:51:51,850 --> 01:51:52,390
It's tails...

2970
01:51:53,830 --> 01:51:54,470
Hmm...

2971
01:51:54,470 --> 01:51:55,230
Alright.

2972
01:51:56,090 --> 01:51:57,190
Swings tail to attack.

2973
01:52:00,350 --> 01:52:02,490
One, two, and poof.

2974
01:52:05,010 --> 01:52:07,670
From the mid and nextie.

2975
01:52:07,810 --> 01:52:09,350
Thank you for the super chat.

2976
01:52:09,590 --> 01:52:09,990
Thank you.

2977
01:52:10,170 --> 01:52:10,770
Thank you.

2978
01:52:15,740 --> 01:52:16,340
Oh yay!

2979
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:17,380
Everyone leveled up!

2980
01:52:17,580 --> 01:52:17,820
Yay!

2981
01:52:21,660 --> 01:52:23,080
Okay, he gets an attack later on.

2982
01:52:23,160 --> 01:52:23,280
See?

2983
01:52:23,420 --> 01:52:23,560
Look!

2984
01:52:23,720 --> 01:52:23,940
See?

2985
01:52:24,060 --> 01:52:24,720
He is fixable!

2986
01:52:26,040 --> 01:52:26,520
Look at that!

2987
01:52:26,640 --> 01:52:27,520
You just gotta believe!

2988
01:52:27,620 --> 01:52:28,680
He's fixable, guys!

2989
01:52:37,380 --> 01:52:38,260
Alright, let's...

2990
01:52:38,780 --> 01:52:39,780
Open this again.

2991
01:52:41,100 --> 01:52:41,980
Alright, clearly...

2992
01:52:41,980 --> 01:52:43,180
There's something over here.

2993
01:52:43,600 --> 01:52:44,400
Oh my god!

2994
01:52:44,440 --> 01:52:45,080
Does he kill me?

2995
01:52:46,280 --> 01:52:47,360
Okay, he just goes...

2996
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:49,300
Little places make this all more fun!

2997
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:53,280
Polly just gave me a car!

2998
01:52:53,480 --> 01:52:53,900
Good luck!

2999
01:52:54,040 --> 01:52:56,420
I don't know anything about the pipes, so it's on you!

3000
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:58,920
Okay, I don't know either.

3001
01:52:59,380 --> 01:53:00,180
Oh no!

3002
01:53:00,680 --> 01:53:01,240
Oh no!

3003
01:53:01,420 --> 01:53:01,980
Okay, I'm...

3004
01:53:01,980 --> 01:53:03,120
I'm so confused.

3005
01:53:04,600 --> 01:53:06,260
Alright, let's just grab items first.

3006
01:53:12,910 --> 01:53:14,970
I think I caught all the mons, right?

3007
01:53:15,230 --> 01:53:17,270
Guys, you guys know if there's any mons I'm missing?

3008
01:53:17,550 --> 01:53:18,650
From the sewers?

3009
01:53:23,530 --> 01:53:24,730
Yeah, I got Twirler.

3010
01:53:30,720 --> 01:53:32,380
Man, I'm so lost!

3011
01:53:32,540 --> 01:53:34,220
Guess I'm missing dinner tonight!

3012
01:53:37,500 --> 01:53:38,340
Does this say...?

3013
01:53:38,340 --> 01:53:39,120
I don't think it does.

3014
01:53:39,340 --> 01:53:41,680
I don't think it tells me like how many mons I have left here.

3015
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:46,180
I haven't fished for one more that I haven't caught yet?

3016
01:53:46,340 --> 01:53:46,520
Alright.

3017
01:53:47,440 --> 01:53:47,740
Bet.

3018
01:53:53,980 --> 01:53:55,260
Alright, it's Cheap Chomp.

3019
01:53:55,420 --> 01:53:56,160
We have that.

3020
01:53:58,960 --> 01:54:00,200
Alright, is there anything else?

3021
01:54:01,060 --> 01:54:02,660
Okay, we'll do two more fishing.

3022
01:54:04,620 --> 01:54:05,820
Fishbone, we got that.

3023
01:54:05,820 --> 01:54:05,900
What?

3024
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:09,840
Oh my god.

3025
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:10,420
He knows.

3026
01:54:10,960 --> 01:54:13,680
Wait, if he's dived down, then I can run away while he's...

3027
01:54:13,680 --> 01:54:14,480
Oh my god.

3028
01:54:14,500 --> 01:54:17,120
I was gonna say, maybe I can run away while he's in the water.

3029
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:18,480
How would he know?

3030
01:54:18,840 --> 01:54:19,580
Holy fuck!

3031
01:54:19,620 --> 01:54:20,060
How do you...

3032
01:54:20,060 --> 01:54:22,340
I'm 20 levels higher than you!

3033
01:54:24,280 --> 01:54:25,400
Okay, there we go.

3034
01:54:26,760 --> 01:54:28,060
Alright, last one.

3035
01:54:31,620 --> 01:54:33,660
God dammit, it's all the fish bones.

3036
01:54:33,960 --> 01:54:35,500
It's all dead fish and...

3037
01:54:35,500 --> 01:54:36,280
fish with lips.

3038
01:54:40,270 --> 01:54:40,970
Alright.

3039
01:54:42,040 --> 01:54:42,670
No more.

3040
01:54:43,610 --> 01:54:44,750
What does this do?

3041
01:54:46,210 --> 01:54:48,110
Oh, it resets everything.

3042
01:54:48,590 --> 01:54:49,010
Huh?

3043
01:54:52,170 --> 01:54:53,390
Oh, I did it!

3044
01:54:53,750 --> 01:54:54,050
Yay!

3045
01:54:54,970 --> 01:54:56,350
It's just that easy.

3046
01:54:59,370 --> 01:55:00,190
Look at that.

3047
01:55:00,710 --> 01:55:02,090
I don't know what I did.

3048
01:55:02,790 --> 01:55:03,170
Yay!

3049
01:55:07,090 --> 01:55:08,190
What did I do?

3050
01:55:08,310 --> 01:55:09,070
I don't know.

3051
01:55:09,390 --> 01:55:10,550
But I did it.

3052
01:55:11,730 --> 01:55:12,290
Mario?

3053
01:55:12,730 --> 01:55:13,810
You can't go any further.

3054
01:55:14,110 --> 01:55:16,190
Lord Bowser's in the middle of an important recital.

3055
01:55:19,010 --> 01:55:19,810
First try.

3056
01:55:20,450 --> 01:55:21,190
Let's go.

3057
01:55:26,490 --> 01:55:27,750
Oh shit, I keep forgetting.

3058
01:55:34,700 --> 01:55:36,140
Wait, he survived that?

3059
01:55:36,340 --> 01:55:37,180
Oh yeah, I forgot.

3060
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:38,540
There wasn't a heat crush.

3061
01:55:46,230 --> 01:55:46,750
Nice.

3062
01:55:49,970 --> 01:55:51,590
Yeah, he's a bit bulky too.

3063
01:55:51,870 --> 01:55:53,750
I mean, he's literally a football player.

3064
01:55:54,830 --> 01:55:55,830
Alright, get out of here.

3065
01:55:57,310 --> 01:55:58,590
That's fucky, right?

3066
01:55:58,590 --> 01:56:00,010
Get out of here.

3067
01:56:00,290 --> 01:56:00,370
Get out of here.

3068
01:56:00,370 --> 01:56:03,790
Let me use all my good moves on this lowly grunt before I fight Bowser.

3069
01:56:05,530 --> 01:56:08,310
No one can understand this mind.

3070
01:56:10,550 --> 01:56:11,930
Let her cook.

3071
01:56:15,010 --> 01:56:16,650
Banzai Bullet Bill.

3072
01:56:21,160 --> 01:56:22,580
It's the same one.

3073
01:56:23,100 --> 01:56:25,580
What makes him different from the other Bullet Bills?

3074
01:56:26,940 --> 01:56:28,480
He looks a little angrier?

3075
01:56:30,660 --> 01:56:33,060
He painted an angrier expression.

3076
01:56:33,780 --> 01:56:35,680
Lord Bowser isn't gonna like this.

3077
01:56:37,980 --> 01:56:39,300
Alright, I'll do one more fishing.

3078
01:56:40,660 --> 01:56:42,800
I'll do one more and see if I can get it.

3079
01:56:43,180 --> 01:56:43,820
Whatever it is.

3080
01:56:43,980 --> 01:56:45,080
God damn it, it's just fishbone.

3081
01:56:48,460 --> 01:56:49,500
Alright, no more.

3082
01:56:51,180 --> 01:56:52,400
No more fishing.

3083
01:56:52,400 --> 01:56:55,200
Sometimes it's not a nice day for fishing.

3084
01:56:59,030 --> 01:56:59,630
Minions!

3085
01:57:02,890 --> 01:57:05,210
Oh my god, he's gonna sing Pinky Peaches!

3086
01:57:05,850 --> 01:57:08,690
Our plan for utter domination is nearing its end.

3087
01:57:09,090 --> 01:57:12,470
Soon, Luigi will claim all his power stars.

3088
01:57:12,470 --> 01:57:15,950
And we'll steal them from him so I can have a wish for myself.

3089
01:57:17,530 --> 01:57:20,570
Comics should still be starting Mario in the Sand Kingdom.

3090
01:57:20,750 --> 01:57:23,210
Giving us ample time to celebrate.

3091
01:57:24,930 --> 01:57:27,050
We have all been wonderful followers.

3092
01:57:27,750 --> 01:57:31,050
And I feel now is the best time to show my gratitude.

3093
01:57:31,770 --> 01:57:32,330
Minions!

3094
01:57:32,530 --> 01:57:34,510
This one is all for you!

3095
01:57:36,110 --> 01:57:37,070
Oh my god.

3096
01:57:37,210 --> 01:57:39,010
Oh my god, it's Jack Black Bowser!

3097
01:57:39,290 --> 01:57:40,010
I knew it!

3098
01:57:40,010 --> 01:57:42,690
Just like Seth Rogen Donkey Kong!

3099
01:57:46,640 --> 01:57:48,460
Oh my god, it's so beautiful.

3100
01:57:52,620 --> 01:57:54,580
Mario, did nobody else see you come in?

3101
01:57:55,020 --> 01:57:57,980
However, we're all busy listening to Lord Bowser anyway.

3102
01:57:58,540 --> 01:57:59,940
Oh my god, it's beautiful.

3103
01:58:01,880 --> 01:58:03,780
Oh, you got Lord Bowser!

3104
01:58:05,160 --> 01:58:07,080
Lord Bowser is so good at the piano.

3105
01:58:07,080 --> 01:58:09,060
I could listen forever.

3106
01:58:12,140 --> 01:58:12,740
Peaches...

3107
01:58:12,740 --> 01:58:13,080
Peaches...

3108
01:58:26,440 --> 01:58:27,040
Peaches...

3109
01:58:27,860 --> 01:58:30,820
Alright, it's enough.

3110
01:58:31,240 --> 01:58:31,660
Are we on stage?

3111
01:58:31,800 --> 01:58:32,460
We were definitely upset.

3112
01:58:32,660 --> 01:58:34,520
Bowser, okay...

3113
01:58:36,220 --> 01:58:37,800
Okay, now I can make him angry.

3114
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,820
Yeah, I recognize the chorus.

3115
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,660
Mario, how dare you interrupt my performance?

3116
01:58:47,120 --> 01:58:48,880
Minions, on the stage!

3117
01:58:49,020 --> 01:58:51,740
I'm not even done with the B section.

3118
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,700
Let my song power you up, my minions.

3119
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,900
I'll take care of this, Lord Bowser.

3120
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:01,620
That's right.

3121
01:59:02,300 --> 01:59:06,420
Oh my god, and I get the beautiful Peaches background music on the side.

3122
01:59:10,020 --> 01:59:12,580
Oh my god, he's so empowered!

3123
01:59:12,980 --> 01:59:14,240
Oh my god!

3124
01:59:14,780 --> 01:59:16,540
With the power of music!

3125
01:59:19,560 --> 01:59:21,980
Too bad he's just gonna get flipped!

3126
01:59:22,620 --> 01:59:25,160
That's right, get out of here!

3127
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:29,520
Power of music won't save you.

3128
01:59:33,080 --> 01:59:33,960
That's right!

3129
01:59:35,280 --> 01:59:36,900
Oh shit, no, not acrobatic.

3130
01:59:37,120 --> 01:59:38,740
Okay, that attack actually is pretty strong.

3131
01:59:39,160 --> 01:59:40,020
Oh my god!

3132
01:59:40,380 --> 01:59:45,160
And a coo- Okay, that's a little awkward.

3133
01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:51,960
That's- Ooh, that's a little- Oh, that's a little- Guys, I think I might- I should have healed.

3134
01:59:52,420 --> 01:59:52,780
I-

3135
01:59:57,860 --> 01:59:59,160
Oh, that's awkward.

3136
01:59:59,420 --> 02:00:00,820
Okay, do you think they'll heal me?

3137
02:00:02,920 --> 02:00:06,080
Oh, guys, the power of music is a little strong.

3138
02:00:09,660 --> 02:00:10,660
Holy shit!

3139
02:00:11,080 --> 02:00:13,300
It's okay, Ryze, you got this.

3140
02:00:14,020 --> 02:00:15,560
Who would've thought...

3141
02:00:15,560 --> 02:00:17,780
The power of music.

3142
02:00:18,220 --> 02:00:20,800
Oh my god, he's just using one move!

3143
02:00:26,860 --> 02:00:27,740
Okay, nice.

3144
02:00:28,020 --> 02:00:28,800
Okay, that's okay.

3145
02:00:28,960 --> 02:00:30,660
Ryze, you can redeem yourself here.

3146
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,380
Sick butt, this is your moment.

3147
02:00:39,600 --> 02:00:41,460
It's okay, I think Ryze can live this.

3148
02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:44,380
Sorry, thank you for the super chat.

3149
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:45,200
Thank you, thank you.

3150
02:00:45,340 --> 02:00:46,540
It's all downhill from here.

3151
02:00:46,880 --> 02:00:49,020
That's okay, we'll get healed here, right?

3152
02:00:49,860 --> 02:00:52,020
Like, I'll get healed here, right, guys?

3153
02:00:53,660 --> 02:00:54,840
What does bulk up do?

3154
02:00:55,080 --> 02:00:55,580
Oh, nothing.

3155
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:56,980
It's not an attack.

3156
02:00:58,540 --> 02:01:01,140
Not an attack equals not learn.

3157
02:01:04,740 --> 02:01:06,900
How's Mario always so strong?

3158
02:01:07,500 --> 02:01:07,860
Hey, guys.

3159
02:01:08,140 --> 02:01:09,100
Can I get healed?

3160
02:01:09,240 --> 02:01:10,900
Guys, a little heal there.

3161
02:01:11,660 --> 02:01:12,300
Guys?

3162
02:01:16,440 --> 02:01:18,740
Guys, how about a little heal here?

3163
02:01:20,920 --> 02:01:22,860
What happened to all the heals?

3164
02:01:28,840 --> 02:01:30,640
No heal, only attack.

3165
02:01:31,020 --> 02:01:31,740
Can you heal?

3166
02:01:37,340 --> 02:01:38,220
Maybe not.

3167
02:01:42,020 --> 02:01:44,140
Does it look like I have...

3168
02:01:44,140 --> 02:01:45,000
Oh, hey!

3169
02:01:46,200 --> 02:01:47,040
Oh, yes!

3170
02:01:47,240 --> 02:01:47,900
Okay, that's good.

3171
02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:49,360
Okay, it's okay.

3172
02:01:49,540 --> 02:01:50,140
Dad, you're back.

3173
02:01:50,260 --> 02:01:50,720
Come back here.

3174
02:01:51,060 --> 02:01:51,720
That's fine.

3175
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:53,660
Okay, we got this.

3176
02:01:55,780 --> 02:01:57,180
No heal, at least.

3177
02:01:57,500 --> 02:01:59,000
Only Lord balance your music.

3178
02:01:59,400 --> 02:02:00,540
All right, die for the cause.

3179
02:02:04,350 --> 02:02:05,070
It's okay.

3180
02:02:05,070 --> 02:02:05,770
You did great.

3181
02:02:05,990 --> 02:02:07,510
You did good, BBBoon.

3182
02:02:07,790 --> 02:02:08,650
You did good.

3183
02:02:13,330 --> 02:02:14,510
Okay, that's okay.

3184
02:02:14,810 --> 02:02:15,930
Like, that's okay.

3185
02:02:16,150 --> 02:02:17,790
I didn't realize that also does that.

3186
02:02:18,690 --> 02:02:19,670
That's okay.

3187
02:02:20,010 --> 02:02:20,570
You know what?

3188
02:02:20,650 --> 02:02:21,790
Get stick bugged.

3189
02:02:25,020 --> 02:02:25,720
That's right.

3190
02:02:26,980 --> 02:02:28,680
Get stick bugged.

3191
02:02:32,500 --> 02:02:33,040
All right.

3192
02:02:33,180 --> 02:02:34,060
Maybe that does a lot.

3193
02:02:37,680 --> 02:02:38,380
Oh, yay!

3194
02:02:38,660 --> 02:02:39,020
It does!

3195
02:02:42,280 --> 02:02:43,240
Oh, okay.

3196
02:02:43,320 --> 02:02:43,660
That's fine.

3197
02:02:47,280 --> 02:02:48,020
Okay, yeah.

3198
02:02:49,260 --> 02:02:49,980
All right, dad.

3199
02:02:50,120 --> 02:02:50,840
Get back in here.

3200
02:02:51,480 --> 02:02:51,900
He's back.

3201
02:02:51,980 --> 02:02:53,460
He's back with milk, guys.

3202
02:02:54,480 --> 02:02:55,580
He came back with milk.

3203
02:03:00,120 --> 02:03:00,860
Oh, God.

3204
02:03:01,020 --> 02:03:01,140
Okay.

3205
02:03:01,280 --> 02:03:02,220
I have, like, five.

3206
02:03:06,140 --> 02:03:06,960
It's okay.

3207
02:03:07,300 --> 02:03:09,200
I have the final move.

3208
02:03:09,200 --> 02:03:12,480
That will save us all when we need it.

3209
02:03:14,860 --> 02:03:15,460
Wah!

3210
02:03:18,440 --> 02:03:19,040
Whatever.

3211
02:03:19,480 --> 02:03:21,380
Surgeon Guy will take care of you.

3212
02:03:22,820 --> 02:03:24,020
Don't worry, men.

3213
02:03:24,200 --> 02:03:25,620
I'll take down Mario.

3214
02:03:26,560 --> 02:03:27,400
That's right.

3215
02:03:27,740 --> 02:03:28,880
You and what army?

3216
02:03:32,280 --> 02:03:33,120
It's okay.

3217
02:03:33,700 --> 02:03:36,360
We have four moves to make it count.

3218
02:03:36,720 --> 02:03:37,600
Four PP moves.

3219
02:03:37,900 --> 02:03:39,700
Five, actually, in the end.

3220
02:03:39,700 --> 02:03:41,240
I have a secret...

3221
02:03:41,240 --> 02:03:42,840
I have a secret move right here.

3222
02:03:43,900 --> 02:03:45,040
Oh, never mind.

3223
02:03:47,500 --> 02:03:49,180
I still have my secret move.

3224
02:03:49,300 --> 02:03:50,040
No, my money!

3225
02:03:52,160 --> 02:03:52,900
It's okay.

3226
02:03:53,400 --> 02:03:55,340
I still have my secret move.

3227
02:03:58,520 --> 02:03:59,040
Nice.

3228
02:04:00,840 --> 02:04:05,680
Peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches.

3229
02:04:11,020 --> 02:04:15,200
Peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches.

3230
02:04:15,260 --> 02:04:16,120
How do you miss?

3231
02:04:19,360 --> 02:04:20,800
He's right there!

3232
02:04:22,600 --> 02:04:24,320
Oh my god.

3233
02:04:26,280 --> 02:04:26,920
Alright.

3234
02:04:27,660 --> 02:04:28,840
This is awkward.

3235
02:04:30,700 --> 02:04:33,220
Okay, he's hit with everything, but that's okay.

3236
02:04:33,500 --> 02:04:34,740
You got this, dad.

3237
02:04:37,540 --> 02:04:39,840
We might have to cut off your toes.

3238
02:04:40,820 --> 02:04:41,940
To prevent...

3239
02:04:41,940 --> 02:04:45,360
We might have to cut off your toes because you have frostbite, but that's okay.

3240
02:04:46,100 --> 02:04:46,740
Alright, Bowser.

3241
02:04:47,160 --> 02:04:47,720
We're...

3242
02:04:47,720 --> 02:04:49,520
No match for Mario.

3243
02:04:49,860 --> 02:04:50,800
We're sorry.

3244
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:54,180
But keep playing.

3245
02:04:57,040 --> 02:04:58,320
Thank you, everyone.

3246
02:04:58,900 --> 02:05:03,700
Now then, I think it's time we meet up with Comic to discuss our next course of action.

3247
02:05:03,700 --> 02:05:08,300
You may know our plan now, but that doesn't mean we're going to stop.

3248
02:05:08,560 --> 02:05:10,580
Tell Luigi whatever you want.

3249
02:05:10,840 --> 02:05:13,340
He's too naive to think otherwise.

3250
02:05:13,900 --> 02:05:17,720
Oh, and I think I'm finally starting to enjoy this game.

3251
02:05:17,880 --> 02:05:18,440
Ha ha ha.

3252
02:05:18,900 --> 02:05:21,200
Oh, and I don't need this anymore.

3253
02:05:21,200 --> 02:05:22,840
Oh, I got the microphone.

3254
02:05:23,040 --> 02:05:23,240
Yay.

3255
02:05:23,780 --> 02:05:24,260
Wait, I live.

3256
02:05:25,080 --> 02:05:26,080
Wait, what?

3257
02:05:26,780 --> 02:05:30,720
Oh, it's a chopper piano from Super Mario 64.

3258
02:05:31,680 --> 02:05:32,660
Mad piano.

3259
02:05:32,660 --> 02:05:34,040
He's mad now.

3260
02:05:37,780 --> 02:05:38,720
It's okay.

3261
02:05:39,520 --> 02:05:40,660
I got a baseball cap.

3262
02:05:42,500 --> 02:05:43,580
Okay, he's strong.

3263
02:05:43,900 --> 02:05:44,720
Okay, this is bad.

3264
02:05:45,260 --> 02:05:45,600
Oh, no.

3265
02:05:45,880 --> 02:05:46,040
Okay.

3266
02:05:46,320 --> 02:05:47,620
Oh, it's not very effective.

3267
02:05:48,140 --> 02:05:49,360
Oh, but I have frostbite.

3268
02:05:49,460 --> 02:05:49,840
I forgot.

3269
02:05:50,540 --> 02:05:50,920
I forgot.

3270
02:05:51,940 --> 02:05:52,640
That's okay.

3271
02:05:53,040 --> 02:05:53,730
I'm going to see how...

3272
02:05:54,180 --> 02:05:54,600
Maybe.

3273
02:05:55,060 --> 02:05:56,120
I might be lucky.

3274
02:05:56,420 --> 02:05:56,680
Yay!

3275
02:05:57,420 --> 02:05:58,040
Oh, fuck.

3276
02:05:58,440 --> 02:05:58,920
Never mind.

3277
02:05:59,100 --> 02:05:59,400
He...

3278
02:05:59,400 --> 02:06:00,300
Never mind.

3279
02:06:00,300 --> 02:06:00,980
He tricked me.

3280
02:06:01,900 --> 02:06:03,540
Dad, you can live through this.

3281
02:06:03,820 --> 02:06:05,400
I believe, Dad!

3282
02:06:06,640 --> 02:06:07,140
Dad!

3283
02:06:07,400 --> 02:06:08,000
Dad, come on!

3284
02:06:10,940 --> 02:06:11,740
No!

3285
02:06:12,880 --> 02:06:14,420
Oh, no.

3286
02:06:15,100 --> 02:06:15,880
Ooh.

3287
02:06:16,740 --> 02:06:17,040
Whoa.

3288
02:06:17,860 --> 02:06:18,780
It's okay.

3289
02:06:18,840 --> 02:06:19,680
We can catch this.

3290
02:06:20,080 --> 02:06:20,500
We...

3291
02:06:20,500 --> 02:06:22,700
We can catch this.

3292
02:06:22,940 --> 02:06:23,840
All right.

3293
02:06:24,120 --> 02:06:24,720
Okay.

3294
02:06:24,720 --> 02:06:27,000
We have a dream lineup.

3295
02:06:27,400 --> 02:06:28,020
It's okay.

3296
02:06:32,100 --> 02:06:33,220
It's okay.

3297
02:06:33,900 --> 02:06:34,700
It's...

3298
02:06:34,700 --> 02:06:35,500
I believe.

3299
02:06:35,880 --> 02:06:37,500
I believe in us.

3300
02:06:37,760 --> 02:06:37,980
I believe.

3301
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:38,840
I believe.

3302
02:06:39,240 --> 02:06:40,020
Oh, my God.

3303
02:06:40,020 --> 02:06:41,260
It doesn't affect them.

3304
02:06:41,720 --> 02:06:42,480
Get stick bugged.

3305
02:06:42,600 --> 02:06:42,960
Oh!

3306
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:43,580
Oh!

3307
02:06:45,920 --> 02:06:47,120
I still believe.

3308
02:06:47,480 --> 02:06:48,260
It's still possible.

3309
02:06:49,060 --> 02:06:50,200
It's still...

3310
02:06:50,200 --> 02:06:50,920
Okay.

3311
02:06:51,140 --> 02:06:51,480
That's good.

3312
02:06:51,580 --> 02:06:51,960
That's good.

3313
02:06:52,120 --> 02:06:52,600
That's good.

3314
02:06:54,200 --> 02:06:55,000
That's good.

3315
02:06:55,780 --> 02:06:57,040
We're still in this.

3316
02:06:57,360 --> 02:06:58,660
We're still in this.

3317
02:06:58,800 --> 02:06:59,600
We're still...

3318
02:06:59,600 --> 02:07:00,480
Oh, shit.

3319
02:07:00,760 --> 02:07:01,440
Oh, shit.

3320
02:07:01,520 --> 02:07:01,740
Okay.

3321
02:07:02,020 --> 02:07:03,400
We're still in this.

3322
02:07:05,640 --> 02:07:06,820
I'm risking it.

3323
02:07:11,760 --> 02:07:12,320
Yes!

3324
02:07:14,280 --> 02:07:15,920
Oh, I got a critical catch!

3325
02:07:16,540 --> 02:07:17,320
Oh, that was close!

3326
02:07:17,660 --> 02:07:18,820
That was so close!

3327
02:07:18,980 --> 02:07:20,480
That was actually so close!

3328
02:07:22,520 --> 02:07:25,340
A piano that gained sentience while inside a ghost house.

3329
02:07:25,500 --> 02:07:28,260
Rumors say that feasts on the souls of those scares.

3330
02:07:30,320 --> 02:07:32,080
It's surprisingly in tune.

3331
02:07:33,540 --> 02:07:34,420
Oh, Xeon!

3332
02:07:34,560 --> 02:07:35,420
Thank you for the super chat!

3333
02:07:35,640 --> 02:07:36,560
Thank you!

3334
02:07:36,800 --> 02:07:39,400
I don't know what's gonna happen, but I'd like to be the piano regardless.

3335
02:07:39,760 --> 02:07:40,000
Alright.

3336
02:07:40,680 --> 02:07:42,780
Okay, you don't have another Mon, right?

3337
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:43,800
I swear to God.

3338
02:07:44,360 --> 02:07:51,840
Don't take advantage of the fact that we've named so many that I forgot which ones people actually have now.

3339
02:07:53,140 --> 02:07:54,100
Xeon Goon.

3340
02:07:54,260 --> 02:07:55,200
Oh, wait.

3341
02:07:55,500 --> 02:07:57,020
Yes, he should be in the Goon Cave.

3342
02:07:59,480 --> 02:07:59,960
Alright.

3343
02:08:01,560 --> 02:08:04,360
No, he should be, like, here.

3344
02:08:04,900 --> 02:08:05,720
Oh, where's the other guy?

3345
02:08:05,800 --> 02:08:06,140
Oh, yeah.

3346
02:08:06,580 --> 02:08:06,840
Alright.

3347
02:08:07,900 --> 02:08:09,420
BBB, you've had your time.

3348
02:08:10,440 --> 02:08:12,100
Now you can be a- You know what?

3349
02:08:12,200 --> 02:08:15,960
Now you can be a- Now you can be a, um...

3350
02:08:17,040 --> 02:08:18,300
Be on the top now.

3351
02:08:18,300 --> 02:08:21,540
Ha- ha- ha- ha- ha- ha.

3352
02:08:27,800 --> 02:08:28,280
Alright.

3353
02:08:31,680 --> 02:08:33,360
Seems like, yeah, I'll take it.

3354
02:08:33,580 --> 02:08:34,640
I gotta get healed anyway.

3355
02:08:34,640 --> 02:08:34,740
Okay.

3356
02:08:37,080 --> 02:08:37,740
Where am I?

3357
02:08:37,900 --> 02:08:38,520
Oh, here I am.

3358
02:08:39,660 --> 02:08:40,680
Great job, Osiris!

3359
02:08:40,900 --> 02:08:42,960
Now we can finally get back to our everyday lives!

3360
02:08:43,080 --> 02:08:43,840
Oh, I have all the stuff.

3361
02:08:47,320 --> 02:08:48,340
So, I'll give you something.

3362
02:08:48,560 --> 02:08:49,840
I'll give to all my minions.

3363
02:08:50,300 --> 02:08:51,820
Oh, I got the Naughty Mint.

3364
02:08:52,040 --> 02:08:52,580
Wait, what?

3365
02:08:54,220 --> 02:08:57,440
I cannot know when I'll see you again, man in red and blue.

3366
02:08:57,760 --> 02:09:01,120
My hope is when I'm still... I mean, landed on the... Wait, what?

3367
02:09:02,860 --> 02:09:03,880
What is that?

3368
02:09:04,620 --> 02:09:05,900
Oh, wait.

3369
02:09:07,260 --> 02:09:08,480
Can be smelled.

3370
02:09:08,760 --> 02:09:11,460
It ups attacks but reduces... Oh, okay.

3371
02:09:11,740 --> 02:09:12,440
Okay, it's not as bad.

3372
02:09:12,580 --> 02:09:13,920
Okay, guys, it's not that bad, guys.

3373
02:09:14,400 --> 02:09:16,320
It can be smelled and it ups attack.

3374
02:09:16,760 --> 02:09:16,860
Okay.

3375
02:09:19,220 --> 02:09:19,920
Naughty Mint.

3376
02:09:20,160 --> 02:09:21,680
I got a little worried there.

3377
02:09:21,740 --> 02:09:23,500
I was like, what do you mean, Naughty Mint?

3378
02:09:27,400 --> 02:09:29,180
Oh, it lets me change nature.

3379
02:09:29,400 --> 02:09:30,700
Oh, that's interesting.

3380
02:09:31,760 --> 02:09:34,460
Sniff on... No, I didn't say that!

3381
02:09:37,520 --> 02:09:39,140
Wait, how do I... Oh, there we go.

3382
02:09:39,400 --> 02:09:39,760
Yoshi's Whistle.

3383
02:09:39,860 --> 02:09:41,220
I keep forgetting to use the Yoshi.

3384
02:09:43,040 --> 02:09:44,340
Alright, we got the microphone.

3385
02:09:44,840 --> 02:09:46,240
We can fight Pauline now.

3386
02:09:46,360 --> 02:09:48,740
We finally get our fucking other power star.

3387
02:09:48,740 --> 02:09:49,520
Mario.

3388
02:09:49,940 --> 02:09:54,500
I don't know what you did, but all the toilets in New York City can flush again.

3389
02:09:54,780 --> 02:09:55,720
How do I know that?

3390
02:09:55,720 --> 02:09:57,900
I'm just a little mayor's intuition.

3391
02:09:58,500 --> 02:10:00,480
And thanks for getting my microphone back.

3392
02:10:00,700 --> 02:10:03,380
With this, we can finally get the show on the road.

3393
02:10:03,580 --> 02:10:04,220
You ready?

3394
02:10:06,040 --> 02:10:07,860
Give it all you got, Mario.

3395
02:10:08,580 --> 02:10:10,500
Oh my gosh, she's so into me, guys.

3396
02:10:10,520 --> 02:10:11,740
She wants to get back together.

3397
02:10:13,760 --> 02:10:15,760
Guys, I broke up with her.

3398
02:10:16,480 --> 02:10:16,840
Okay?

3399
02:10:17,440 --> 02:10:18,300
It's not the other way.

3400
02:10:18,300 --> 02:10:20,080
Despite what the rumors say.

3401
02:10:20,480 --> 02:10:23,380
I was the one that broke up with her.

3402
02:10:26,160 --> 02:10:27,120
And look at that.

3403
02:10:27,240 --> 02:10:28,960
Now she's crawled.

3404
02:10:29,100 --> 02:10:31,340
She wants to crawl back to me.

3405
02:10:33,740 --> 02:10:34,620
Oh my god.

3406
02:10:34,640 --> 02:10:35,560
He's so strong.

3407
02:10:35,740 --> 02:10:36,280
What the fuck?

3408
02:10:37,740 --> 02:10:38,740
Okay, critical hit.

3409
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:39,140
Nice.

3410
02:10:40,120 --> 02:10:40,560
Cool.

3411
02:10:40,940 --> 02:10:41,120
Shit.

3412
02:10:41,460 --> 02:10:43,260
I'm not even through the first verse yet.

3413
02:10:44,060 --> 02:10:46,000
I would have thought that would be like...

3414
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:46,900
You know, what was it called?

3415
02:10:47,680 --> 02:10:48,400
What was that?

3416
02:10:48,600 --> 02:10:51,440
The famous song in that game?

3417
02:11:00,030 --> 02:11:01,090
I remember the song.

3418
02:11:01,230 --> 02:11:01,630
What was it called?

3419
02:11:01,690 --> 02:11:02,590
The title of that song?

3420
02:11:02,890 --> 02:11:03,850
Yeah, Jump Up Superstar.

3421
02:11:03,910 --> 02:11:07,250
Yeah, I assumed the song playing would be Jump Up Superstar.

3422
02:11:12,360 --> 02:11:13,380
Since it's Pauline.

3423
02:11:20,060 --> 02:11:20,600
That's fine.

3424
02:11:20,940 --> 02:11:21,320
That's right.

3425
02:11:21,420 --> 02:11:22,900
Get out of here, Chain Chomp.

3426
02:11:23,940 --> 02:11:25,040
Yeah, it would have been a nice touch.

3427
02:11:25,320 --> 02:11:26,340
I mean, it's just little things.

3428
02:11:27,020 --> 02:11:28,480
Because already, it's like pretty good.

3429
02:11:30,040 --> 02:11:30,560
Okay.

3430
02:11:31,300 --> 02:11:32,460
A charge that we burn...

3431
02:11:33,060 --> 02:11:35,340
The foe also hurts the user.

3432
02:11:35,540 --> 02:11:37,060
Okay, I don't want to like hurt himself.

3433
02:11:40,900 --> 02:11:41,420
Fuck.

3434
02:11:41,720 --> 02:11:41,900
Okay.

3435
02:11:42,620 --> 02:11:44,140
No, we gotta keep this.

3436
02:11:44,960 --> 02:11:45,480
What?

3437
02:11:45,760 --> 02:11:46,020
Guys!

3438
02:11:46,720 --> 02:11:47,740
Explosion, though!

3439
02:11:52,500 --> 02:11:54,880
Okay, we get rid of one of the fight moves, though.

3440
02:11:56,720 --> 02:11:58,360
Dad does not want...

3441
02:11:58,360 --> 02:12:00,480
Doki does not want Dad to hurt herself.

3442
02:12:00,840 --> 02:12:02,700
She says that she still keeps...

3443
02:12:02,700 --> 02:12:03,580
Explosion.

3444
02:12:04,220 --> 02:12:06,380
No, but he crashed has been...

3445
02:12:06,380 --> 02:12:08,460
He crashed has been so good to me!

3446
02:12:10,940 --> 02:12:11,840
Cross chop?

3447
02:12:15,140 --> 02:12:16,540
All right, cross chop.

3448
02:12:16,720 --> 02:12:16,880
Okay.

3449
02:12:20,300 --> 02:12:23,840
We gotta keep Explosion all the way to the end!

3450
02:12:24,220 --> 02:12:25,680
We start with Explosion!

3451
02:12:25,880 --> 02:12:27,440
We end with Explosion!

3452
02:12:34,150 --> 02:12:34,830
Comatose?

3453
02:12:36,250 --> 02:12:37,570
He's already sleepy?

3454
02:12:37,990 --> 02:12:39,510
He just started the game!

3455
02:12:41,670 --> 02:12:42,350
Goodbye!

3456
02:12:43,010 --> 02:12:43,450
Goodbye!

3457
02:12:43,450 --> 02:12:43,970
That's right!

3458
02:12:44,210 --> 02:12:44,410
That's right!

3459
02:12:44,410 --> 02:12:45,050
Get out of here!

3460
02:12:46,250 --> 02:12:47,510
Yes, I have!

3461
02:12:47,730 --> 02:12:49,990
Watch part 1 of MARIO MARIO MARIO MARIO MARIO!

3462
02:12:55,350 --> 02:12:57,010
We start with...

3463
02:12:57,010 --> 02:12:58,430
We start with...

3464
02:12:58,430 --> 02:12:59,070
Self destruct!

3465
02:12:59,290 --> 02:13:01,130
We end with Explosion!

3466
02:13:03,910 --> 02:13:05,550
As it should be.

3467
02:13:11,910 --> 02:13:13,490
Alright, sit on it!

3468
02:13:14,450 --> 02:13:15,130
Yeah!

3469
02:13:16,210 --> 02:13:16,730
Yeah!

3470
02:13:17,810 --> 02:13:19,390
Oh shit, okay, I might die.

3471
02:13:20,270 --> 02:13:21,070
That's fine.

3472
02:13:25,460 --> 02:13:26,920
That's right, he'll live!

3473
02:13:27,380 --> 02:13:28,260
Watch this!

3474
02:13:28,600 --> 02:13:28,900
Yeah!

3475
02:13:31,560 --> 02:13:32,840
Holy fuck!

3476
02:13:33,200 --> 02:13:35,320
What an HP in the dream!

3477
02:13:37,660 --> 02:13:40,360
Okay, is he faster?

3478
02:13:40,680 --> 02:13:42,780
No ma- no, I think dad's faster.

3479
02:13:43,020 --> 02:13:43,640
There's no way.

3480
02:13:44,200 --> 02:13:46,020
Dad has to be faster.

3481
02:13:46,420 --> 02:13:47,320
I believe.

3482
02:13:51,040 --> 02:13:51,800
Yeah!

3483
02:13:53,700 --> 02:13:54,940
All in!

3484
02:13:55,620 --> 02:13:56,840
Gambo, Gambo!

3485
02:14:00,880 --> 02:14:03,160
One HP in a dream!

3486
02:14:05,160 --> 02:14:07,260
I liked my odds.

3487
02:14:07,780 --> 02:14:09,020
Never punish.

3488
02:14:09,400 --> 02:14:10,440
Great job, Mario!

3489
02:14:10,680 --> 02:14:12,660
Seems the audience loved our little show.

3490
02:14:12,940 --> 02:14:15,480
Now then, I believe this belongs to you.

3491
02:14:16,540 --> 02:14:18,720
Mario, you see the New Donk City Power Star?

3492
02:14:18,900 --> 02:14:19,000
Yay!

3493
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:21,940
One HP is all he needs, guys.

3494
02:14:23,360 --> 02:14:24,240
Incredible Gambo.

3495
02:14:25,980 --> 02:14:27,100
Yay, I got a TM!

3496
02:14:30,840 --> 02:14:33,880
That contains Smart Strike, a move that will always strike true.

3497
02:14:34,320 --> 02:14:37,040
I hope you'll make good use of it in What Remains of Your Cap Challenge.

3498
02:14:37,680 --> 02:14:38,280
Hey, bro!

3499
02:14:38,960 --> 02:14:40,020
What a super battle!

3500
02:14:40,460 --> 02:14:41,720
I'll meet you outside, okay?

3501
02:14:43,680 --> 02:14:44,240
Yeah!

3502
02:14:44,620 --> 02:14:45,560
Okay, I got the plumber.

3503
02:14:48,120 --> 02:14:48,840
All right.

3504
02:14:49,420 --> 02:14:50,880
Oh, she so wants me.

3505
02:14:53,240 --> 02:14:55,240
Wow, great battle, bro.

3506
02:14:55,740 --> 02:14:57,740
Now, there's only two Power Stars left.

3507
02:14:58,160 --> 02:15:02,400
We've sure gone a long way from Toad Town, so we can't stop now.

3508
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:03,320
Come on!

3509
02:15:03,520 --> 02:15:03,900
Come on!

3510
02:15:03,900 --> 02:15:05,140
On to World 7!

3511
02:15:06,860 --> 02:15:07,280
Um...

3512
02:15:07,280 --> 02:15:08,440
Solid, thank you for the super chat.

3513
02:15:08,540 --> 02:15:08,740
Thank you.

3514
02:15:08,920 --> 02:15:09,320
Thank you.

3515
02:15:09,400 --> 02:15:11,320
Female Doki voice acting sound pretty sweet.

3516
02:15:11,440 --> 02:15:13,320
Not that regular Doki is not sweet or anything.

3517
02:15:13,720 --> 02:15:16,360
Regular Doki is more gremlin-like.

3518
02:15:16,360 --> 02:15:19,880
I heard that the World 7 World Pipe is out of service.

3519
02:15:20,420 --> 02:15:20,980
Another one?

3520
02:15:21,400 --> 02:15:22,160
Another one?

3521
02:15:22,320 --> 02:15:24,680
What's going on at the warp zone, bro?

3522
02:15:27,560 --> 02:15:29,360
What an easy job.

3523
02:15:29,740 --> 02:15:31,520
I could have done it without you.

3524
02:15:33,220 --> 02:15:35,960
Nothing is impossible when we work together.

3525
02:15:37,840 --> 02:15:38,440
Plus...

3526
02:15:39,200 --> 02:15:39,900
Oh my god!

3527
02:15:39,940 --> 02:15:41,180
They cut it in half?

3528
02:15:41,420 --> 02:15:44,620
This place has plenty of spare parts.

3529
02:15:44,620 --> 02:15:45,160
Wow!

3530
02:15:46,220 --> 02:15:46,780
Oh my god!

3531
02:15:46,880 --> 02:15:48,480
They cut the plum...

3532
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:50,200
The fucking pipe in half!

3533
02:15:53,100 --> 02:15:54,520
I think I call in a favor.

3534
02:15:54,760 --> 02:15:55,500
Come with me.

3535
02:15:56,800 --> 02:15:58,100
Where is she taking me?

3536
02:15:59,960 --> 02:16:00,800
Oh my god.

3537
02:16:02,300 --> 02:16:02,880
Just a moment.

3538
02:16:03,080 --> 02:16:04,540
I gotta make a call real quick.

3539
02:16:10,020 --> 02:16:10,460
Hello?

3540
02:16:11,400 --> 02:16:14,700
Yeah, I got a couple of plumbers looking to make their way up to space.

3541
02:16:14,880 --> 02:16:15,040
What?

3542
02:16:15,560 --> 02:16:17,080
Oh, am I going to Rosalina?

3543
02:16:17,900 --> 02:16:18,880
Can you help us out?

3544
02:16:19,600 --> 02:16:20,380
Of course.

3545
02:16:20,640 --> 02:16:21,040
You too.

3546
02:16:23,180 --> 02:16:23,660
Wait.

3547
02:16:24,980 --> 02:16:25,380
Wait.

3548
02:16:25,640 --> 02:16:26,220
No rainbow?

3549
02:16:26,640 --> 02:16:28,760
Guess she ran out of budget or something.

3550
02:16:29,380 --> 02:16:32,780
Anyway, this should take you all the way up to Comet Observatory.

3551
02:16:33,020 --> 02:16:34,580
Don't worry about the edge of the road.

3552
02:16:34,580 --> 02:16:37,340
You should fly up before you fall off.

3553
02:16:37,900 --> 02:16:39,080
But, Miss Pauline!

3554
02:16:39,380 --> 02:16:40,520
Don't have our...

3555
02:16:40,520 --> 02:16:41,740
We don't have our carts.

3556
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,320
Can you order shop for the banana peeling?

3557
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:46,620
Hmm.

3558
02:16:46,940 --> 02:16:48,980
I might have some extra carts in the garage.

3559
02:16:48,980 --> 02:16:49,660
Let me check.

3560
02:16:49,780 --> 02:16:50,640
Oh my god.

3561
02:16:50,860 --> 02:16:55,180
Guys, why pay $80 for Super Mario Kart World when I can play...

3562
02:16:55,180 --> 02:16:57,180
When I can do it here for free?

3563
02:16:58,000 --> 02:16:59,680
Hey, do standard modules work?

3564
02:16:59,920 --> 02:17:02,440
I don't see any B-dashers or Mach-8s.

3565
02:17:03,340 --> 02:17:05,580
Miss Pauline, you're too kind.

3566
02:17:06,060 --> 02:17:07,520
Whatever works for you.

3567
02:17:08,160 --> 02:17:09,720
Isn't this exciting, bro?

3568
02:17:10,520 --> 02:17:11,540
New carts!

3569
02:17:12,740 --> 02:17:13,640
Here you two are.

3570
02:17:13,920 --> 02:17:15,140
Be safe on the road.

3571
02:17:15,420 --> 02:17:15,740
Yay!

3572
02:17:16,440 --> 02:17:17,960
I got a standard cart!

3573
02:17:19,480 --> 02:17:20,400
You ready to leave?

3574
02:17:20,480 --> 02:17:21,780
Okay, I gotta heal first.

3575
02:17:22,440 --> 02:17:23,120
Dad is...

3576
02:17:23,120 --> 02:17:26,880
Despite how cool it was that we won with 1 HP on Dad...

3577
02:17:26,880 --> 02:17:28,880
I think we might need to heal him.

3578
02:17:29,100 --> 02:17:33,220
I feel like it might not be cool to keep him 1 HP.

3579
02:17:34,540 --> 02:17:36,160
Alright, get in here.

3580
02:17:37,540 --> 02:17:38,680
Oh yeah, you're right.

3581
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:40,800
Well, I pay $80 when I can give...

3582
02:17:40,800 --> 02:17:46,160
When I can pay $90 for Sonic Racing instead.

3583
02:17:47,140 --> 02:17:48,600
And Hatsune Miku.

3584
02:17:50,240 --> 02:17:51,380
Nah, I don't need heals.

3585
02:17:54,180 --> 02:17:55,140
Yeah, I'm ready.

3586
02:17:55,760 --> 02:17:56,720
Last one to the comment.

3587
02:17:56,920 --> 02:17:57,940
So already mixed the spaghetti.

3588
02:17:59,520 --> 02:18:01,640
Three, two, one.

3589
02:18:09,470 --> 02:18:11,130
That's a photo finish.

3590
02:18:11,570 --> 02:18:14,050
We were all like Skirt and Kabloo.

3591
02:18:14,630 --> 02:18:18,650
Oh well, guess we'll never know who got a first place, bro.

3592
02:18:19,330 --> 02:18:23,390
By the way, I don't think Bowser and his goons are gonna follow us up here.

3593
02:18:23,390 --> 02:18:26,510
He's gonna be left behind in the race for the Power Stars.

3594
02:18:26,790 --> 02:18:28,590
I'm sure he has a plan to catch up.

3595
02:18:28,810 --> 02:18:30,730
We could just focus on ourselves here.

3596
02:18:32,230 --> 02:18:33,590
Oh, yes you should.

3597
02:18:34,150 --> 02:18:36,490
Welcome back to the Common Conservatory.

3598
02:18:36,490 --> 02:18:42,270
The two of you, before you challenge me, I only ask for two things.

3599
02:18:43,330 --> 02:18:45,310
These stars will take...

3600
02:18:45,310 --> 02:18:46,250
I love this song too.

3601
02:18:46,570 --> 02:18:51,450
This is like one of my favorite like study songs that I put on when I'm like working.

3602
02:18:52,650 --> 02:18:56,090
These stars will take you to planets where you'll collect silver stars.

3603
02:18:56,370 --> 02:18:59,630
Two on this planet, and three on this planet.

3604
02:19:00,270 --> 02:19:02,870
You'll need to challenge my Lumos for them.

3605
02:19:03,190 --> 02:19:04,990
Don't let their cuteness fool you.

3606
02:19:04,990 --> 02:19:07,010
They're quite the fighters.

3607
02:19:08,350 --> 02:19:13,230
When you get five silver stars, come back here to make it into the Warp Star.

3608
02:19:13,770 --> 02:19:17,850
Shooting you to the top of the spire, or you can challenge me.

3609
02:19:18,570 --> 02:19:21,750
But don't feel pressured to complete my quest so soon.

3610
02:19:22,010 --> 02:19:25,650
Feel free to explore around and talk to my Lumos.

3611
02:19:25,910 --> 02:19:27,530
They love the company.

3612
02:19:28,370 --> 02:19:28,930
Alright.

3613
02:19:29,230 --> 02:19:33,630
We're so close to finishing the challenge, but we can't stop now.

3614
02:19:33,630 --> 02:19:37,110
Well, whichever planet you go to, I'll go to the other one.

3615
02:19:37,330 --> 02:19:38,550
Let's meet up later.

3616
02:19:39,810 --> 02:19:40,750
Mamma mia.

3617
02:19:41,450 --> 02:19:42,190
And give it a...

3618
02:19:42,190 --> 02:19:43,430
I'll get the Shisafelion.

3619
02:19:43,610 --> 02:19:43,850
Thank you.

3620
02:19:43,990 --> 02:19:44,530
Thank you.

3621
02:19:45,850 --> 02:19:48,170
Welcome to the comet observatory.

3622
02:19:49,430 --> 02:19:49,950
Mario.

3623
02:19:50,590 --> 02:19:52,290
Mamma is waiting for you.

3624
02:19:52,510 --> 02:19:53,770
You should talk to her.

3625
02:19:54,770 --> 02:19:55,930
Okay, I need to get...

3626
02:19:55,930 --> 02:19:56,670
Uh...

3627
02:19:56,670 --> 02:19:57,570
Silver stars.

3628
02:19:58,230 --> 02:19:59,230
Oh, there's the items!

3629
02:19:59,430 --> 02:19:59,630
Nice!

3630
02:19:59,770 --> 02:20:00,050
Yoink!

3631
02:20:00,190 --> 02:20:00,550
My...

3632
02:20:00,550 --> 02:20:01,630
My loot now!

3633
02:20:04,350 --> 02:20:07,110
Are you going to take the launch star that's up ahead?

3634
02:20:07,550 --> 02:20:10,390
Make sure you're properly prepared before you do!

3635
02:20:16,640 --> 02:20:19,400
Mamma told me to sell you all sorts of things!

3636
02:20:19,620 --> 02:20:20,560
Oh wait, what do they have?

3637
02:20:20,860 --> 02:20:21,520
What do they have here?

3638
02:20:21,520 --> 02:20:23,040
Dora cat...

3639
02:20:23,040 --> 02:20:23,840
Mulaney?

3640
02:20:25,620 --> 02:20:28,980
Wait, a better cat with a higher catch rate than a plumber cat.

3641
02:20:29,120 --> 02:20:30,340
Okay, so...

3642
02:20:30,340 --> 02:20:31,360
Wait, I already...

3643
02:20:31,360 --> 02:20:33,140
I already have the best one though, so it's fine.

3644
02:20:34,660 --> 02:20:36,020
What can you take on my child?

3645
02:20:36,280 --> 02:20:37,080
Hmm, I don't know.

3646
02:20:37,260 --> 02:20:39,940
Come back once you collected all the power stars.

3647
02:20:41,620 --> 02:20:45,200
Later, Bluely must like my friend over here to sell stuff in order to help mama out.

3648
02:20:46,080 --> 02:20:47,380
Do they all have mommy issues?

3649
02:20:48,240 --> 02:20:50,960
I may not look like it, but I'm actually a scientist.

3650
02:20:51,520 --> 02:20:52,440
I like the research...

3651
02:20:52,440 --> 02:20:53,540
What kind of fucking science...

3652
02:20:53,540 --> 02:20:53,840
What...

3653
02:20:53,840 --> 02:20:55,400
What do you get out of bedtime stories?

3654
02:20:55,660 --> 02:20:56,380
No, I don't need heals.

3655
02:20:56,600 --> 02:20:57,300
I'm invincible.

3656
02:20:58,320 --> 02:21:01,060
Rosalina has a lot of bedtime stories in these bookshelves!

3657
02:21:01,280 --> 02:21:05,180
I'm not trying to read anymore because it's making me creepy!

3658
02:21:07,260 --> 02:21:07,940
Hey, Mario!

3659
02:21:08,240 --> 02:21:09,360
Have you seen our blue friend?

3660
02:21:09,620 --> 02:21:11,180
He's making her acting a little suspicious!

3661
02:21:11,980 --> 02:21:12,640
Have you seen him?

3662
02:21:12,860 --> 02:21:14,180
Do you even need to come back?

3663
02:21:15,540 --> 02:21:19,340
The library here in the Observatory has all sorts of information.

3664
02:21:19,820 --> 02:21:23,600
But if not that information is useful to you, it's a whole different story though.

3665
02:21:24,860 --> 02:21:25,240
Bio!

3666
02:21:25,520 --> 02:21:26,540
That means you love your team!

3667
02:21:26,740 --> 02:21:28,200
Oh, I could have just healed it up here.

3668
02:21:29,240 --> 02:21:30,840
Wait, those are actual kids?

3669
02:21:31,240 --> 02:21:33,660
Wait, how does she give birth to so many stars?

3670
02:21:34,480 --> 02:21:35,340
Wait, take a picture of me.

3671
02:21:39,030 --> 02:21:39,430
Yay!

3672
02:21:40,230 --> 02:21:40,490
Nice.

3673
02:21:41,550 --> 02:21:42,410
Wait, how does she...

3674
02:21:42,410 --> 02:21:43,150
Who's the dad?

3675
02:21:45,590 --> 02:21:47,910
We don't ask questions like that.

3676
02:21:48,250 --> 02:21:48,890
I'm just...

3677
02:21:48,890 --> 02:21:50,690
You said they're all our kids!

3678
02:21:51,510 --> 02:21:52,070
Mario!

3679
02:21:52,430 --> 02:21:54,850
Mama told me you're supposed to make good luck!

3680
02:21:56,730 --> 02:21:57,150
Yes!

3681
02:21:57,290 --> 02:21:59,450
The Toad doesn't notice you as it looks blissfully...

3682
02:21:59,450 --> 02:22:00,450
Oh, yeah, I'll nudge him.

3683
02:22:01,270 --> 02:22:01,570
Bye!

3684
02:22:03,070 --> 02:22:04,390
Toad was ejected.

3685
02:22:04,530 --> 02:22:06,290
That's right, as it should be.

3686
02:22:09,090 --> 02:22:09,650
Oh!

3687
02:22:10,270 --> 02:22:11,190
Oh, you can fight!

3688
02:22:11,190 --> 02:22:11,970
Oh!

3689
02:22:12,790 --> 02:22:13,990
The fuck is that?

3690
02:22:14,330 --> 02:22:15,430
It's just a shape.

3691
02:22:16,550 --> 02:22:18,170
Or just a fucking shape.

3692
02:22:19,430 --> 02:22:20,010
Ma!

3693
02:22:20,550 --> 02:22:22,370
There's a weird shape in the backyard!

3694
02:22:24,630 --> 02:22:28,070
It's a fucking triangle in the backyard, Ma!

3695
02:22:31,890 --> 02:22:32,770
All right.

3696
02:22:33,310 --> 02:22:34,070
Get out here.

3697
02:22:35,690 --> 02:22:36,930
Ew, shapes.

3698
02:22:36,930 --> 02:22:38,010
What's he gonna do?

3699
02:22:38,110 --> 02:22:39,570
Fucking do trigonometry on me?

3700
02:22:40,490 --> 02:22:41,510
God damn it!

3701
02:22:41,670 --> 02:22:42,590
You're so low level!

3702
02:22:43,130 --> 02:22:43,970
Know your place!

3703
02:22:45,090 --> 02:22:45,570
Ma!

3704
02:22:45,790 --> 02:22:46,690
He's looking at me!

3705
02:22:46,930 --> 02:22:47,830
It's fucking weird!

3706
02:22:56,850 --> 02:22:57,330
Yeah!

3707
02:22:57,770 --> 02:22:57,930
All right.

3708
02:22:57,970 --> 02:22:59,650
Who wants to be the weird-ass triangle?

3709
02:22:59,650 --> 02:23:01,330
The mini-yucks.

3710
02:23:02,570 --> 02:23:02,990
Yay!

3711
02:23:08,690 --> 02:23:11,010
A creation from the X-knot army.

3712
02:23:11,230 --> 02:23:12,330
Meant to help out yucks.

3713
02:23:12,510 --> 02:23:14,090
Its shape makes it a sturdy foe.

3714
02:23:14,250 --> 02:23:16,850
This triangle is the best shape ever, period.

3715
02:23:18,270 --> 02:23:18,890
All right.

3716
02:23:21,870 --> 02:23:22,530
Let's see.

3717
02:23:25,870 --> 02:23:26,310
Depends.

3718
02:23:26,410 --> 02:23:27,610
Is Doritos hiring?

3719
02:23:29,450 --> 02:23:30,010
All right.

3720
02:23:30,150 --> 02:23:30,570
Let's see.

3721
02:23:30,770 --> 02:23:31,450
I'll give it to...

3722
02:23:32,910 --> 02:23:34,830
I'll give it to the person that looks...

3723
02:23:34,830 --> 02:23:36,970
Looks like a triangle the most.

3724
02:23:38,170 --> 02:23:39,690
Personally, I like circles more.

3725
02:23:39,830 --> 02:23:40,150
All right.

3726
02:23:41,370 --> 02:23:41,810
Min...

3727
02:23:46,010 --> 02:23:47,130
Min Goon.

3728
02:23:47,390 --> 02:23:48,510
This is your birthright.

3729
02:23:52,390 --> 02:23:53,310
That guy!

3730
02:23:53,650 --> 02:23:54,470
How dare you?

3731
02:23:55,210 --> 02:23:56,930
I thought space was traversable.

3732
02:23:57,210 --> 02:23:57,950
With the ship?

3733
02:23:58,350 --> 02:23:59,850
But there's no water here!

3734
02:23:59,970 --> 02:24:01,230
Sorry, I just realized it was a toad.

3735
02:24:02,990 --> 02:24:05,090
You can't deny what your birthright...

3736
02:24:06,270 --> 02:24:07,630
Okay, Ma-ra.

3737
02:24:08,150 --> 02:24:09,790
Okay, I feel like I should...

3738
02:24:09,790 --> 02:24:12,050
That looks like he's made of water.

3739
02:24:16,340 --> 02:24:18,720
You don't get to choose what you're born as.

3740
02:24:21,020 --> 02:24:22,000
Okay, I knew it.

3741
02:24:22,060 --> 02:24:24,960
I fucking knew you were a water type, you fucking whore.

3742
02:24:25,240 --> 02:24:26,260
I knew it.

3743
02:24:26,540 --> 02:24:26,900
All right.

3744
02:24:27,540 --> 02:24:28,520
You got this, Hefli.

3745
02:24:31,180 --> 02:24:31,900
Tank that.

3746
02:24:36,900 --> 02:24:38,200
I believe in you.

3747
02:24:39,220 --> 02:24:40,720
Okay, that you took a lot.

3748
02:24:41,360 --> 02:24:43,820
That was a lot of damage, but I still believed.

3749
02:24:46,780 --> 02:24:47,240
I was like...

3750
02:24:47,240 --> 02:24:48,180
Tank that soldier, boy.

3751
02:24:49,360 --> 02:24:49,760
Yay!

3752
02:24:53,180 --> 02:24:54,640
Wait, what is he about to use?

3753
02:24:54,760 --> 02:24:55,840
Oh, I didn't read in time.

3754
02:24:58,660 --> 02:25:00,580
Oh, there's like a Mario in the background.

3755
02:25:00,780 --> 02:25:01,680
I just noticed it.

3756
02:25:03,160 --> 02:25:04,780
Oh, fuck, it's fishbowl.

3757
02:25:06,540 --> 02:25:07,020
Whoops.

3758
02:25:07,440 --> 02:25:08,400
I should have read.

3759
02:25:08,600 --> 02:25:09,460
I should have read.

3760
02:25:12,760 --> 02:25:14,380
I was like, I don't know.

3761
02:25:14,580 --> 02:25:15,720
It can't be that important.

3762
02:25:18,340 --> 02:25:19,060
All right.

3763
02:25:19,440 --> 02:25:20,580
You're tanking this one.

3764
02:25:29,850 --> 02:25:30,770
That's right.

3765
02:25:31,310 --> 02:25:32,690
I brought a dinosaur.

3766
02:25:33,850 --> 02:25:36,110
Okay, and then I start crunching it.

3767
02:25:36,670 --> 02:25:37,350
Crunch him!

3768
02:25:39,170 --> 02:25:40,130
Oh my god.

3769
02:25:40,170 --> 02:25:41,150
I hate fish bones.

3770
02:25:41,310 --> 02:25:42,170
They're such pussies.

3771
02:25:42,170 --> 02:25:43,930
All they do is just dive.

3772
02:25:49,100 --> 02:25:50,280
That's all they do.

3773
02:25:54,120 --> 02:25:55,340
The dive spam.

3774
02:25:56,060 --> 02:25:57,700
Goddamn pussies.

3775
02:25:59,840 --> 02:26:01,980
I'm a fish out of water and space.

3776
02:26:02,540 --> 02:26:03,180
That's right.

3777
02:26:03,640 --> 02:26:05,460
What you doing bringing fishes in here?

3778
02:26:06,180 --> 02:26:07,420
Out in the water.

3779
02:26:08,580 --> 02:26:09,300
What's this?

3780
02:26:09,460 --> 02:26:10,620
Oh, it's a teepee.

3781
02:26:11,980 --> 02:26:13,520
Oh, I see.

3782
02:26:15,480 --> 02:26:17,020
Wait, there's grass here?

3783
02:26:17,400 --> 02:26:18,200
What the fuck?

3784
02:26:19,280 --> 02:26:20,560
Why is there grass here?

3785
02:26:20,640 --> 02:26:22,140
Oh, it's another mini yucks.

3786
02:26:23,040 --> 02:26:23,680
Okay, get out.

3787
02:26:23,820 --> 02:26:24,400
I gotta leave.

3788
02:26:26,200 --> 02:26:26,760
Bye.

3789
02:26:28,360 --> 02:26:29,920
Okay, is there anything good?

3790
02:26:30,720 --> 02:26:31,620
Space grass.

3791
02:26:31,900 --> 02:26:32,880
Yeah, I was gonna say, why is there...

3792
02:26:32,880 --> 02:26:34,520
Oh, there's the X-Knot!

3793
02:26:37,740 --> 02:26:38,560
Baseball cap.

3794
02:26:42,260 --> 02:26:42,780
Yay!

3795
02:26:43,620 --> 02:26:45,240
Thank god, I don't have to try for this.

3796
02:26:46,940 --> 02:26:48,580
All right, X-Knot time.

3797
02:26:49,500 --> 02:26:50,660
Just a little guy.

3798
02:26:54,060 --> 02:26:56,560
A loyal peon to Lord Crump.

3799
02:26:56,560 --> 02:27:00,560
Make me X-Knot and I am yours to command.

3800
02:27:01,240 --> 02:27:03,780
Zekra, thank you for the Akka soup.

3801
02:27:03,960 --> 02:27:05,120
But thank you, thank you.

3802
02:27:05,300 --> 02:27:06,380
You know how like...

3803
02:27:06,380 --> 02:27:11,420
Like there's always like one person who is a huge fan of the most obscure fucking thing ever?

3804
02:27:11,920 --> 02:27:12,600
Like that...

3805
02:27:12,600 --> 02:27:14,780
I was like, holy shit.

3806
02:27:15,180 --> 02:27:18,260
It's an X-Knot's number one fan right here.

3807
02:27:19,360 --> 02:27:20,760
It works better within a group.

3808
02:27:20,840 --> 02:27:25,060
So it's been a really effective party member for the cap challenge.

3809
02:27:25,780 --> 02:27:27,680
I am that fan.

3810
02:27:28,080 --> 02:27:30,100
It's an X-Knot has no fans.

3811
02:27:30,340 --> 02:27:31,480
I am dead.

3812
02:27:37,100 --> 02:27:37,900
Okay.

3813
02:27:40,340 --> 02:27:41,140
Zekra...

3814
02:27:41,140 --> 02:27:45,240
It's like that one girl that's like super obsessed with Stan...

3815
02:27:45,240 --> 02:27:47,080
Stan Marsh from South Park.

3816
02:27:49,140 --> 02:27:53,080
There's always one fan that makes it their whole life.

3817
02:27:55,360 --> 02:27:56,240
Oh, shit.

3818
02:27:56,380 --> 02:27:57,140
I just called him Zekra.

3819
02:27:58,440 --> 02:28:00,100
He is him!

3820
02:28:05,540 --> 02:28:07,520
Oh, there's a Luma!

3821
02:28:10,880 --> 02:28:12,840
He is Exxon.

3822
02:28:13,220 --> 02:28:14,600
Just so powerful.

3823
02:28:14,880 --> 02:28:15,760
He just stopped.

3824
02:28:19,500 --> 02:28:21,160
He's literally him.

3825
02:28:22,060 --> 02:28:23,780
Not even good anymore.

3826
02:28:24,280 --> 02:28:25,940
He's just is him.

3827
02:28:30,100 --> 02:28:30,720
What's your wish?

3828
02:28:30,840 --> 02:28:31,720
Your wish is...

3829
02:28:31,720 --> 02:28:32,880
You're already full HP.

3830
02:28:33,220 --> 02:28:33,900
Oh, shit.

3831
02:28:34,040 --> 02:28:34,960
I actually used Fedora.

3832
02:28:41,890 --> 02:28:42,570
Okay.

3833
02:28:43,650 --> 02:28:48,610
I don't remember which one was the stronger cap.

3834
02:28:49,830 --> 02:28:51,050
Oh, it's a helmet.

3835
02:28:51,050 --> 02:28:51,430
Okay.

3836
02:28:55,320 --> 02:28:56,700
Okay, we gotta use that.

3837
02:28:58,880 --> 02:29:01,120
Yeah, I ran out of baseball caps.

3838
02:29:01,840 --> 02:29:02,900
Oh, no.

3839
02:29:03,620 --> 02:29:04,820
Oh, no.

3840
02:29:04,820 --> 02:29:07,000
I gotta buy more bait.

3841
02:29:07,060 --> 02:29:08,160
I'm gonna kidnap her child.

3842
02:29:08,380 --> 02:29:10,360
I'm gonna kidnap Rosalina's child.

3843
02:29:16,290 --> 02:29:16,850
Aww.

3844
02:29:17,770 --> 02:29:18,950
Okay, I actually have to...

3845
02:29:18,950 --> 02:29:20,490
I actually have to fight somebody.

3846
02:29:20,830 --> 02:29:22,070
I have to fight him.

3847
02:29:23,010 --> 02:29:23,930
Alright, get Stickbug.

3848
02:29:27,620 --> 02:29:28,460
That's right.

3849
02:29:28,720 --> 02:29:29,800
It's Stickbug time.

3850
02:29:30,900 --> 02:29:31,980
Okay, I...

3851
02:29:31,980 --> 02:29:33,760
I'm a little scared...

3852
02:29:34,580 --> 02:29:36,600
that he's gonna like kill her.

3853
02:29:37,980 --> 02:29:38,920
I'm gonna...

3854
02:29:38,920 --> 02:29:41,220
I'm a little scared that he might...

3855
02:29:41,220 --> 02:29:41,260
Oh.

3856
02:29:41,760 --> 02:29:42,160
Oh.

3857
02:29:43,060 --> 02:29:43,320
Oh.

3858
02:29:45,040 --> 02:29:46,720
Don't tell Rosalina.

3859
02:29:50,580 --> 02:29:53,040
Don't tell Rosalina what happened.

3860
02:29:54,220 --> 02:29:56,400
Don't tell her what happened.

3861
02:29:56,400 --> 02:29:56,980
No.

3862
02:30:03,490 --> 02:30:05,130
Quick, hide the body.

3863
02:30:05,650 --> 02:30:05,810
Quick.

3864
02:30:06,150 --> 02:30:06,610
Somebody...

3865
02:30:06,610 --> 02:30:06,910
It's okay.

3866
02:30:06,990 --> 02:30:07,470
We're in space.

3867
02:30:07,630 --> 02:30:08,950
I can chuck it out of the space.

3868
02:30:08,950 --> 02:30:09,870
And no one will know.

3869
02:30:10,150 --> 02:30:11,310
No one will know.

3870
02:30:14,210 --> 02:30:15,370
I'm so sad.

3871
02:30:15,390 --> 02:30:18,110
I think the Luma was actually a rare encounter.

3872
02:30:19,710 --> 02:30:20,110
No!

3873
02:30:29,110 --> 02:30:29,970
What's she gonna do?

3874
02:30:30,090 --> 02:30:31,150
Count every star?

3875
02:30:32,150 --> 02:30:34,270
She won't notice a missing child.

3876
02:30:39,620 --> 02:30:40,640
I'm so sad.

3877
02:30:40,840 --> 02:30:42,360
The Luma was actually a rare encounter.

3878
02:30:42,480 --> 02:30:43,160
I'm so sad.

3879
02:30:43,380 --> 02:30:44,180
I'm so sad.

3880
02:30:44,340 --> 02:30:44,520
I...

3881
02:30:44,520 --> 02:30:45,460
I didn't know!

3882
02:30:46,080 --> 02:30:52,860
How was I supposed to know my Stickbug was gonna fucking suck up train its life and then chuck it all into the test of space?

3883
02:30:55,260 --> 02:30:57,360
I love looking into the night sky.

3884
02:30:57,600 --> 02:31:00,820
So much, I had to come up to see the stars for myself.

3885
02:31:01,140 --> 02:31:06,160
I trained myself diligently to climb up, thinking it's gonna be as beautiful as I imagined.

3886
02:31:06,160 --> 02:31:11,820
And while it is, the longer I stay up here, the more I start to miss everyone that couldn't come with me.

3887
02:31:12,260 --> 02:31:15,940
Mario, make sure to tell everyone how much you love and appreciate them.

3888
02:31:16,100 --> 02:31:20,540
Cause even though the stars feel eternal, they're just as bleeding as everything else.

3889
02:31:20,540 --> 02:31:23,180
Do you think he knows I committed two murders out here?

3890
02:31:24,980 --> 02:31:26,520
Do you think he knows?

3891
02:31:27,360 --> 02:31:30,300
Do you think he knows I might have to commit a third murder?

3892
02:31:30,300 --> 02:31:31,300
Hahaha!

3893
02:31:33,500 --> 02:31:34,920
Sound about this area suspicious!

3894
02:31:35,380 --> 02:31:36,100
Is it you?

3895
02:31:36,540 --> 02:31:38,900
He knows what you are.

3896
02:31:40,960 --> 02:31:42,520
He knows too much, guys.

3897
02:31:43,080 --> 02:31:43,700
Hahaha!

3898
02:31:51,140 --> 02:31:51,940
Okay...

3899
02:31:51,940 --> 02:31:54,660
We didn't actually kidnap a child.

3900
02:31:54,980 --> 02:31:56,380
We didn't do it, guys.

3901
02:31:56,840 --> 02:31:59,340
There was no evidence a child ever existed.

3902
02:32:03,900 --> 02:32:05,700
Oh wait, it's the actual Duplicose.

3903
02:32:06,980 --> 02:32:08,100
Oh, never mind.

3904
02:32:08,320 --> 02:32:09,120
Oh wait, that's me.

3905
02:32:10,240 --> 02:32:10,980
That's right.

3906
02:32:11,160 --> 02:32:12,560
I'll throw myself out.

3907
02:32:13,480 --> 02:32:14,820
Get out of here.

3908
02:32:19,950 --> 02:32:20,470
Yay!

3909
02:32:28,520 --> 02:32:30,180
Alright, we gotta get...

3910
02:32:30,180 --> 02:32:33,820
We're so close to level 50 for Dragoon.

3911
02:32:34,360 --> 02:32:35,400
I'm so sad.

3912
02:32:35,400 --> 02:32:36,420
I can't believe...

3913
02:32:37,080 --> 02:32:37,600
Nice!

3914
02:32:37,820 --> 02:32:39,040
I won't make the same mistake.

3915
02:32:39,680 --> 02:32:40,320
Come here, child.

3916
02:32:40,580 --> 02:32:41,260
She won't notice.

3917
02:32:41,400 --> 02:32:41,800
You're gone.

3918
02:32:42,380 --> 02:32:43,840
There's so many of you guys.

3919
02:32:44,160 --> 02:32:45,220
She won't know.

3920
02:32:46,040 --> 02:32:47,680
It'll be our little secret.

3921
02:32:48,400 --> 02:32:49,120
Oh yeah, I can heal.

3922
02:32:49,520 --> 02:32:49,900
Nice.

3923
02:32:50,600 --> 02:32:51,040
Wait, what?

3924
02:32:53,560 --> 02:32:53,960
Okay.

3925
02:32:55,780 --> 02:32:56,480
Alright, Rice.

3926
02:32:56,700 --> 02:32:57,120
This is it.

3927
02:32:57,280 --> 02:32:58,220
Oh fuck, I forgot.

3928
02:32:58,600 --> 02:33:00,220
I forgot what you can do.

3929
02:33:00,660 --> 02:33:01,960
Wait, Rice, get out of here.

3930
02:33:02,460 --> 02:33:02,800
No!

3931
02:33:06,780 --> 02:33:07,660
Oh, thank god.

3932
02:33:07,800 --> 02:33:07,960
Okay.

3933
02:33:08,240 --> 02:33:09,420
Okay, that's not an attack.

3934
02:33:09,420 --> 02:33:10,280
Okay, thank god.

3935
02:33:10,440 --> 02:33:10,600
Okay.

3936
02:33:11,100 --> 02:33:11,940
Okay, get out.

3937
02:33:12,240 --> 02:33:13,980
I just remember what you do.

3938
02:33:14,420 --> 02:33:14,800
I...

3939
02:33:14,800 --> 02:33:15,660
I...

3940
02:33:17,040 --> 02:33:18,560
I just remember Perish.

3941
02:33:19,560 --> 02:33:20,520
Okay, there you go.

3942
02:33:21,120 --> 02:33:21,360
Alright.

3943
02:33:21,980 --> 02:33:23,080
This should be okay.

3944
02:33:25,980 --> 02:33:26,900
Oh, thank god.

3945
02:33:27,060 --> 02:33:28,140
Oh wait, it's super effective.

3946
02:33:28,300 --> 02:33:28,520
How?

3947
02:33:29,060 --> 02:33:29,900
The one...

3948
02:33:29,900 --> 02:33:33,880
This one move that I use as a meme is super effective now?

3949
02:33:35,260 --> 02:33:36,200
That's five.

3950
02:33:37,980 --> 02:33:38,960
Okay, good.

3951
02:33:44,230 --> 02:33:44,910
Alright.

3952
02:33:48,640 --> 02:33:49,820
It's one HP.

3953
02:33:50,460 --> 02:33:50,840
Yay!

3954
02:33:51,240 --> 02:33:51,880
We got Luma!

3955
02:33:53,020 --> 02:33:53,700
Nice!

3956
02:33:54,040 --> 02:33:54,700
Child!

3957
02:33:57,600 --> 02:33:59,160
Oh my god.

3958
02:33:59,640 --> 02:34:00,460
Wait, I think...

3959
02:34:00,460 --> 02:34:01,060
I think it's it.

3960
02:34:01,320 --> 02:34:02,440
I think it's time.

3961
02:34:03,020 --> 02:34:03,760
Wait, head charge.

3962
02:34:05,600 --> 02:34:06,140
Imagine...

3963
02:34:06,140 --> 02:34:06,800
A charge using...

3964
02:34:06,800 --> 02:34:07,760
It hurts the user a little.

3965
02:34:11,260 --> 02:34:12,980
Okay, we're gonna get rid of...

3966
02:34:12,980 --> 02:34:13,300
Mmm.

3967
02:34:19,070 --> 02:34:19,610
Okay.

3968
02:34:19,930 --> 02:34:20,530
I don't know.

3969
02:34:21,450 --> 02:34:23,150
Hurts the user a little bit.

3970
02:34:24,410 --> 02:34:25,710
Okay, we'll get rid of butt.

3971
02:34:30,430 --> 02:34:31,530
Alright, head charge.

3972
02:34:31,890 --> 02:34:32,810
Oh my god, it's time.

3973
02:34:32,990 --> 02:34:33,830
We got the twofer.

3974
02:34:35,990 --> 02:34:38,530
A star creature that loves to help everyone.

3975
02:34:38,830 --> 02:34:40,450
It comes in a variety of colors.

3976
02:34:40,450 --> 02:34:41,850
The most common is yellow.

3977
02:34:42,250 --> 02:34:44,150
Rosalina cares for it like it's her child.

3978
02:34:44,250 --> 02:34:45,570
See, it's not even her real kid.

3979
02:34:46,370 --> 02:34:46,630
Alright.

3980
02:34:47,850 --> 02:34:49,170
Doki kills Luna.

3981
02:34:49,510 --> 02:34:50,790
Boss, you killed a child!

3982
02:34:50,930 --> 02:34:51,810
Amazing work!

3983
02:34:52,030 --> 02:34:54,610
That right here is why you're the best boss.

3984
02:34:54,610 --> 02:34:57,290
That's the one and only Solid Snake.

3985
02:34:57,570 --> 02:34:58,530
Thank you for the super chat.

3986
02:34:58,690 --> 02:34:58,990
Thank you.

3987
02:34:59,110 --> 02:34:59,570
Thank you.

3988
02:34:59,830 --> 02:35:00,210
Yay!

3989
02:35:00,650 --> 02:35:03,390
We also adopted a Luma, guys.

3990
02:35:03,970 --> 02:35:04,810
We also...

3991
02:35:04,810 --> 02:35:07,570
There can only be one Star Goon.

3992
02:35:07,750 --> 02:35:09,250
Thank you for the super chat.

3993
02:35:09,810 --> 02:35:10,570
Star, thank you.

3994
02:35:10,670 --> 02:35:11,110
Thank you.

3995
02:35:11,250 --> 02:35:12,490
Demon, thank you for the super chat.

3996
02:35:12,550 --> 02:35:12,830
Thank you.

3997
02:35:12,950 --> 02:35:13,310
Thank you.

3998
02:35:13,410 --> 02:35:13,910
Oh, man.

3999
02:35:14,210 --> 02:35:15,390
I'm sorry, Demon.

4000
02:35:15,610 --> 02:35:17,430
But his name is literally Star.

4001
02:35:18,810 --> 02:35:19,530
It's like...

4002
02:35:19,530 --> 02:35:20,130
It's faded.

4003
02:35:21,410 --> 02:35:21,850
Star...

4004
02:35:25,430 --> 02:35:27,570
Don't worry, I'll name you or something else.

4005
02:35:29,490 --> 02:35:30,170
Yay!

4006
02:35:33,690 --> 02:35:36,470
Yay, we adopted a child, guys, together.

4007
02:35:39,450 --> 02:35:41,190
Oh my god, yes!

4008
02:35:41,630 --> 02:35:41,810
Yes!

4009
02:35:42,230 --> 02:35:42,770
Eat!

4010
02:35:43,790 --> 02:35:45,210
Dragoon, eat!

4011
02:36:01,640 --> 02:36:03,980
Why are you purple?

4012
02:36:04,780 --> 02:36:05,860
What happened?

4013
02:36:17,100 --> 02:36:20,080
Oh my god, what happened to you?

4014
02:36:26,550 --> 02:36:28,230
You're so ugly!

4015
02:36:29,890 --> 02:36:32,070
But you still love us, right?

4016
02:36:42,670 --> 02:36:43,790
I'm ruined!

4017
02:36:44,390 --> 02:36:46,570
Brokai into toxic waste!

4018
02:36:46,950 --> 02:36:47,590
What the fuck?

4019
02:36:48,090 --> 02:36:49,710
Space, thank you for the super chat!

4020
02:36:49,990 --> 02:36:50,870
Thank you, thank you!

4021
02:36:51,190 --> 02:36:53,310
Papa, thank you for the super chat!

4022
02:36:53,530 --> 02:36:54,590
Thank you, thank you!

4023
02:36:54,590 --> 02:36:56,970
The prophecy has been fulfilled.

4024
02:36:57,310 --> 02:37:00,550
Mega, Chonky, Goon, Nixie, and Omni.

4025
02:37:00,670 --> 02:37:01,870
Thank you for the super chat.

4026
02:37:02,090 --> 02:37:02,390
Thank you.

4027
02:37:03,090 --> 02:37:05,090
Aphelia, thank you for the super chat.

4028
02:37:05,190 --> 02:37:05,390
Thank you.

4029
02:37:05,530 --> 02:37:05,930
Thank you.

4030
02:37:06,130 --> 02:37:08,170
Can you rewind in this game?

4031
02:37:10,210 --> 02:37:12,510
Butter, please love us.

4032
02:37:12,790 --> 02:37:14,150
Butter, please.

4033
02:37:15,030 --> 02:37:17,290
Isn't this what you wanted, Butter?

4034
02:37:17,790 --> 02:37:20,090
I kept eating.

4035
02:37:20,650 --> 02:37:22,190
I kept eating.

4036
02:37:22,750 --> 02:37:24,350
That's what you wanted.

4037
02:37:26,010 --> 02:37:29,450
We require your love, Butter.

4038
02:37:39,510 --> 02:37:44,450
Guys, I thought we were gonna get Big Yoshi.

4039
02:37:45,250 --> 02:37:46,230
Whatever.

4040
02:37:47,370 --> 02:37:49,350
I was tricked.

4041
02:37:50,410 --> 02:37:53,450
I thought I was gonna get Yoshi.

4042
02:37:54,590 --> 02:37:56,770
I got tricked.

4043
02:38:00,650 --> 02:38:03,670
You guys told me it'd be him.

4044
02:38:04,410 --> 02:38:06,270
I thought it'd be him.

4045
02:38:07,150 --> 02:38:09,170
Why can't you be like him?

4046
02:38:09,650 --> 02:38:12,650
Why can't you be like Yoshi went to med school?

4047
02:38:12,650 --> 02:38:12,650
Aww.

4048
02:38:15,510 --> 02:38:18,450
Thank you for the super chat.

4049
02:38:18,830 --> 02:38:19,030
Thank you.

4050
02:38:19,210 --> 02:38:19,870
Thank you.

4051
02:38:19,970 --> 02:38:21,430
Thank you, Peter.

4052
02:38:22,170 --> 02:38:24,870
You're like, why aren't you cute like him?

4053
02:38:25,230 --> 02:38:26,210
Like our neighbor?

4054
02:38:27,950 --> 02:38:31,670
Tinder profile picture versus IRL.

4055
02:38:32,330 --> 02:38:34,490
Why we did this, Butter?

4056
02:38:34,790 --> 02:38:36,650
We did this for you.

4057
02:38:40,270 --> 02:38:43,370
No, I got Yoshi from Team Move.

4058
02:38:43,710 --> 02:38:45,550
And his name is Yoube.

4059
02:38:45,890 --> 02:38:47,070
I got Yoube.

4060
02:38:48,030 --> 02:38:50,610
We have Yoshi at home.

4061
02:38:51,490 --> 02:38:52,930
What happened to you?

4062
02:38:53,170 --> 02:38:55,330
I was so happy.

4063
02:38:55,730 --> 02:38:57,650
You can never be him.

4064
02:38:58,110 --> 02:38:59,750
Is there a thing you were the same?

4065
02:38:59,830 --> 02:39:00,950
Who are you?

4066
02:39:02,290 --> 02:39:04,410
Who even are you?

4067
02:39:04,610 --> 02:39:06,150
What happened to her?

4068
02:39:06,150 --> 02:39:08,370
What happened to my Yoshi?

4069
02:39:09,210 --> 02:39:10,230
What happened to my Yoshi?

4070
02:39:13,270 --> 02:39:14,310
What happened to my Yoshi?

4071
02:39:14,310 --> 02:39:14,890
What did you do?

4072
02:39:15,490 --> 02:39:17,810
It's like those cuckoo birds shit.

4073
02:39:19,130 --> 02:39:20,190
Tlook it.

4074
02:39:20,350 --> 02:39:21,430
Oh no.

4075
02:39:22,910 --> 02:39:23,710
No.

4076
02:39:24,310 --> 02:39:24,310
No.

4077
02:39:24,310 --> 02:39:24,310
No.

4078
02:39:24,310 --> 02:39:24,310
No.

4079
02:39:27,150 --> 02:39:28,290
I'm sorry.

4080
02:39:28,550 --> 02:39:30,170
I was so hungry.

4081
02:39:30,550 --> 02:39:33,270
I have one but you have to earn it.

4082
02:39:34,290 --> 02:39:36,790
Where does he even come from?

4083
02:39:37,390 --> 02:39:39,870
Where does you come from?

4084
02:39:42,450 --> 02:39:44,450
It's just, are you a cuckoo?

4085
02:39:44,550 --> 02:39:53,230
It's like those cuckoo birds that like, you know the cuckoo birds that like, they lay their eggs on, into like other birds' nests.

4086
02:39:53,430 --> 02:39:57,850
And then like, as they get older, like you can tell that they're like a lot bigger.

4087
02:39:58,250 --> 02:40:01,310
A lot bigger than like actual birds.

4088
02:40:01,750 --> 02:40:02,890
That's what you are.

4089
02:40:03,130 --> 02:40:05,490
That's what you turn up and I'm like, wait, what?

4090
02:40:05,490 --> 02:40:05,870
What?

4091
02:40:07,690 --> 02:40:10,070
We ate the real child.

4092
02:40:10,390 --> 02:40:12,330
What happened to my Yoshi?

4093
02:40:19,230 --> 02:40:21,010
What happened to him?

4094
02:40:21,110 --> 02:40:22,150
What did you do?

4095
02:40:28,350 --> 02:40:30,310
Momohaku, thank you for the super chat.

4096
02:40:30,470 --> 02:40:31,490
Thank you, thank you.

4097
02:40:32,110 --> 02:40:33,790
What did you do to Yoshi?

4098
02:40:34,450 --> 02:40:36,430
What did you do to him?

4099
02:40:37,470 --> 02:40:41,530
Imagine being a dragon, you always wanted to be an evolving into that.

4100
02:40:47,840 --> 02:40:50,560
Alright, Sigma crew to level 49.

4101
02:40:52,240 --> 02:40:53,260
Wow, great job.

4102
02:40:53,500 --> 02:40:54,660
Here you go, as promised.

4103
02:40:55,520 --> 02:40:56,960
I got a silver star.

4104
02:40:57,520 --> 02:40:59,880
You told us to eat, Doki.

4105
02:40:59,880 --> 02:41:02,620
I got a silver star.

4106
02:41:02,760 --> 02:41:03,540
I got a silver star.

4107
02:41:03,540 --> 02:41:04,440
Oh my god.

4108
02:41:08,200 --> 02:41:09,640
Look at you.

4109
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:12,780
Look at you.

4110
02:41:14,680 --> 02:41:16,720
Oh my god.

4111
02:41:18,120 --> 02:41:20,380
I love us.

4112
02:41:35,180 --> 02:41:36,640
What did you do?

4113
02:41:36,640 --> 02:41:38,660
Wait, no.

4114
02:41:41,180 --> 02:41:46,780
I can't look at you anymore.

4115
02:41:47,060 --> 02:41:51,900
I spent so much of my time alone just like that.

4116
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:53,660
Wait, don't worry.

4117
02:41:54,680 --> 02:41:56,260
Don't worry, guys.

4118
02:41:58,340 --> 02:42:00,620
Some info on you.

4119
02:42:01,740 --> 02:42:05,160
Appeared in Mario & Luigi prior to his time and was created by the shrews.

4120
02:42:05,160 --> 02:42:08,240
And literally ate the Yoshis on Yoshi's Island.

4121
02:42:08,440 --> 02:42:11,120
He got to go inside his belly.

4122
02:42:11,680 --> 02:42:13,200
No, don't worry, guys.

4123
02:42:13,460 --> 02:42:15,000
We can fix this.

4124
02:42:15,380 --> 02:42:17,280
We can fix this.

4125
02:42:23,540 --> 02:42:24,260
Okay.

4126
02:42:34,980 --> 02:42:36,480
We can fix this, guys.

4127
02:42:36,980 --> 02:42:38,200
Do not worry.

4128
02:42:41,460 --> 02:42:44,040
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4129
02:42:44,220 --> 02:42:44,820
You just...

4130
02:42:44,820 --> 02:42:46,800
You need a rest, guys.

4131
02:42:47,080 --> 02:42:48,240
You guys need a rest.

4132
02:42:48,400 --> 02:42:50,960
You had such a long day.

4133
02:42:50,960 --> 02:42:54,400
I heard that some people have trouble breathing in space.

4134
02:42:54,660 --> 02:42:55,520
What's the issue?

4135
02:42:55,860 --> 02:42:58,020
It's not like you're breathing in anything bad.

4136
02:42:59,240 --> 02:43:02,180
You're just... You're just... You're just having a little break, guys.

4137
02:43:02,400 --> 02:43:04,640
You had a long day, everyone.

4138
02:43:05,040 --> 02:43:07,920
You all had such a long day.

4139
02:43:14,500 --> 02:43:18,160
Well, you see, it all started when I was disowned by my mother.

4140
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,880
No, you guys all had such a long day.

4141
02:43:21,900 --> 02:43:23,520
You're so tired.

4142
02:43:23,940 --> 02:43:26,160
We're all so tired.

4143
02:43:26,880 --> 02:43:28,620
Francisca, thank you for the super chat.

4144
02:43:28,780 --> 02:43:28,960
Thank you.

4145
02:43:29,220 --> 02:43:29,600
Thank you.

4146
02:43:29,800 --> 02:43:31,140
Chaz, don't get a Mexican mom.

4147
02:43:31,240 --> 02:43:33,800
Make us eat the whole plate and then disowning us.

4148
02:43:34,080 --> 02:43:36,300
No, you guys are so tired.

4149
02:43:36,300 --> 02:43:36,920
Dude, you...

4150
02:43:36,920 --> 02:43:40,800
You worked so hard, everyone.

4151
02:43:44,500 --> 02:43:45,920
That's a silver star.

4152
02:43:46,080 --> 02:43:49,380
If you only found one, you're gonna need two from this area.

4153
02:43:49,380 --> 02:43:51,280
I wanna get to mama's power star.

4154
02:43:51,900 --> 02:43:53,680
Wait, we'll take a launch here for now.

4155
02:43:54,280 --> 02:43:55,500
And then...

4156
02:43:55,500 --> 02:43:56,820
Let us...

4157
02:43:58,580 --> 02:43:59,820
Okay, where was...

4158
02:43:59,820 --> 02:44:00,920
Where did it say it was?

4159
02:44:01,240 --> 02:44:01,940
Warp pipe.

4160
02:44:02,520 --> 02:44:03,860
Okay, it was like...

4161
02:44:03,860 --> 02:44:04,680
Here, right?

4162
02:44:06,700 --> 02:44:07,860
Where was it?

4163
02:44:07,960 --> 02:44:08,880
Okay.

4164
02:44:10,200 --> 02:44:11,260
Where was it?

4165
02:44:15,490 --> 02:44:16,810
Okay, it's up here.

4166
02:44:17,030 --> 02:44:17,270
Alright.

4167
02:44:19,810 --> 02:44:21,610
Oh, it was the safari zone.

4168
02:44:21,610 --> 02:44:22,310
I remember.

4169
02:44:23,070 --> 02:44:23,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4170
02:44:26,350 --> 02:44:27,390
No, no, no.

4171
02:44:27,510 --> 02:44:30,030
You're just so tired, guys.

4172
02:44:30,450 --> 02:44:32,430
So very tired.

4173
02:44:38,550 --> 02:44:42,610
This guy rest after all the hard work.

4174
02:44:42,790 --> 02:44:45,610
I tried so hard and licked so much.

4175
02:44:45,830 --> 02:44:48,370
But in the end, it doesn't even matter.

4176
02:44:48,370 --> 02:44:51,250
It goes, thank you for the super chat.

4177
02:44:51,550 --> 02:44:53,450
No, no, no, no, no, guys.

4178
02:44:53,730 --> 02:44:54,330
No, no, no.

4179
02:44:55,510 --> 02:44:56,730
Everything is fine.

4180
02:44:57,370 --> 02:44:59,410
Delta, thank you for the super chat.

4181
02:44:59,590 --> 02:44:59,930
Thank you.

4182
02:45:00,130 --> 02:45:00,470
Thank you.

4183
02:45:00,770 --> 02:45:02,190
Today in Mario, man.

4184
02:45:02,410 --> 02:45:03,570
Don't keep it disbalanced.

4185
02:45:03,830 --> 02:45:08,010
The track goes after they fall into a half a ton of fat dinosaurs.

4186
02:45:08,010 --> 02:45:10,290
A green triangle is named after a minute.

4187
02:45:10,410 --> 02:45:13,110
And the actual green triangle in chat is confused.

4188
02:45:13,670 --> 02:45:15,210
Thank you for the super chat.

4189
02:45:15,410 --> 02:45:15,850
Thank you.

4190
02:45:16,050 --> 02:45:16,710
Thank you.

4191
02:45:22,640 --> 02:45:24,040
Champion, thank you for the super chat.

4192
02:45:24,140 --> 02:45:24,440
Thank you.

4193
02:45:24,640 --> 02:45:25,340
Thank you.

4194
02:45:33,100 --> 02:45:35,420
Yeah, you're just taking a little nap, guys.

4195
02:45:35,440 --> 02:45:37,740
You worked so hard to be here.

4196
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:39,640
Just taking a little nap.

4197
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:41,440
Why am I in the safari...

4198
02:45:41,440 --> 02:45:42,700
Don't worry about it.

4199
02:45:42,900 --> 02:45:44,300
Don't worry about it.

4200
02:45:44,400 --> 02:45:45,800
Don't worry about it.

4201
02:45:45,980 --> 02:45:47,040
About why I'm here.

4202
02:45:47,320 --> 02:45:48,040
Do not worry.

4203
02:45:58,400 --> 02:45:59,580
Wait, actually.

4204
02:45:59,980 --> 02:46:00,660
Wait a minute.

4205
02:46:01,420 --> 02:46:03,520
Why am I trying to get...

4206
02:46:03,520 --> 02:46:03,940
Okay.

4207
02:46:06,200 --> 02:46:07,000
Oh, wait.

4208
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:07,380
I...

4209
02:46:07,380 --> 02:46:08,200
I forgot.

4210
02:46:08,520 --> 02:46:09,500
I, like...

4211
02:46:09,500 --> 02:46:10,940
Raised you from a...

4212
02:46:14,620 --> 02:46:15,480
No, no, no.

4213
02:46:15,500 --> 02:46:16,380
Don't worry about it.

4214
02:46:16,460 --> 02:46:17,080
No, no, no, no.

4215
02:46:17,740 --> 02:46:18,460
Don't worry.

4216
02:46:24,440 --> 02:46:25,120
It's okay.

4217
02:46:26,300 --> 02:46:27,220
Oh, thank God.

4218
02:46:27,220 --> 02:46:27,500
Okay.

4219
02:46:34,490 --> 02:46:35,770
Oh, that is...

4220
02:46:35,770 --> 02:46:37,450
Oh, that is...

4221
02:46:37,450 --> 02:46:38,710
What do you mean?

4222
02:46:38,850 --> 02:46:39,150
Oh, my God.

4223
02:46:40,070 --> 02:46:40,550
Yay.

4224
02:46:42,350 --> 02:46:42,830
Yay.

4225
02:46:47,750 --> 02:46:48,230
Who's...

4226
02:46:48,230 --> 02:46:49,350
Nothing, guys.

4227
02:46:49,570 --> 02:46:50,490
Nothing, nothing, guys.

4228
02:46:50,730 --> 02:46:51,190
It's nobody.

4229
02:46:51,430 --> 02:46:51,730
It's nobody.

4230
02:46:52,070 --> 02:46:52,570
It's no one.

4231
02:46:52,610 --> 02:46:53,410
It's no one, guys.

4232
02:46:54,070 --> 02:46:54,870
It's nobody.

4233
02:46:55,130 --> 02:46:55,590
It's nobody.

4234
02:46:56,290 --> 02:46:56,630
It's...

4235
02:46:56,630 --> 02:46:57,710
It's no one.

4236
02:46:57,850 --> 02:46:58,990
Guys, don't worry about it.

4237
02:46:59,750 --> 02:47:00,230
Don't...

4238
02:47:02,790 --> 02:47:04,330
Don't worry about it, guys.

4239
02:47:04,630 --> 02:47:05,310
Don't worry about it.

4240
02:47:05,310 --> 02:47:06,410
It's no one.

4241
02:47:06,630 --> 02:47:07,110
It's nobody.

4242
02:47:07,510 --> 02:47:08,810
It's no one.

4243
02:47:19,780 --> 02:47:20,480
Okay.

4244
02:47:24,740 --> 02:47:25,880
Oh my god.

4245
02:47:26,160 --> 02:47:27,740
Oh my god, we did it, guys!

4246
02:47:28,100 --> 02:47:32,220
We reversed... We reversed the evolution!

4247
02:47:33,360 --> 02:47:34,920
Oh my god!

4248
02:47:35,740 --> 02:47:36,500
Look at that!

4249
02:47:36,640 --> 02:47:37,840
You're beautiful again!

4250
02:47:38,780 --> 02:47:42,100
Oh, you're beautiful, guys!

4251
02:47:42,540 --> 02:47:43,400
Look at you!

4252
02:47:45,900 --> 02:47:47,420
You're so beautiful!

4253
02:47:50,780 --> 02:47:53,980
Now we can actually level...

4254
02:47:53,980 --> 02:47:59,240
Now we can turn you into the Yoshi that we've always wanted you to be.

4255
02:48:04,880 --> 02:48:05,320
Yoshi!

4256
02:48:08,940 --> 02:48:10,540
Look at you!

4257
02:48:15,510 --> 02:48:17,230
Oh my god!

4258
02:48:18,490 --> 02:48:18,950
Dragoon!

4259
02:48:26,770 --> 02:48:28,030
Look at you!

4260
02:48:28,730 --> 02:48:30,030
You're so...

4261
02:48:30,030 --> 02:48:32,390
You're so cute, guys!

4262
02:48:32,850 --> 02:48:33,610
Look at you!

4263
02:48:34,230 --> 02:48:35,190
What do you mean?

4264
02:48:35,790 --> 02:48:36,750
You're so...

4265
02:48:36,750 --> 02:48:39,190
You're so cute, guys!

4266
02:48:44,350 --> 02:48:44,990
You're so cute, guys!

4267
02:48:44,990 --> 02:48:46,470
What high horsepower?

4268
02:48:46,790 --> 02:48:47,570
The fuck is that?

4269
02:48:49,910 --> 02:48:51,190
Lamsa... Oh shit!

4270
02:48:51,550 --> 02:48:52,590
Yeah, let's get that in.

4271
02:48:56,370 --> 02:48:57,390
Oh my god!

4272
02:48:57,590 --> 02:48:57,590
Oh my god!

4273
02:48:57,590 --> 02:48:58,830
Look at you, Dragoon!

4274
02:48:59,050 --> 02:48:59,950
Now you're...

4275
02:48:59,950 --> 02:49:00,770
You're perfect!

4276
02:49:01,250 --> 02:49:01,790
Poor god!

4277
02:49:02,870 --> 02:49:04,570
Mr. Broken Pod!

4278
02:49:04,750 --> 02:49:06,170
Thank you for the super chat!

4279
02:49:06,390 --> 02:49:06,610
Thank you!

4280
02:49:06,770 --> 02:49:07,150
Thank you!

4281
02:49:08,030 --> 02:49:08,810
No, look!

4282
02:49:08,850 --> 02:49:09,670
You're beautiful!

4283
02:49:10,290 --> 02:49:10,550
Yes!

4284
02:49:10,790 --> 02:49:12,630
Look how beautiful you are!

4285
02:49:14,050 --> 02:49:14,570
I'm afraid!

4286
02:49:14,650 --> 02:49:15,930
Thank you for the super chat!

4287
02:49:16,110 --> 02:49:16,370
Thank you!

4288
02:49:16,550 --> 02:49:17,010
Thank you!

4289
02:49:19,070 --> 02:49:19,330
Thank you!

4290
02:49:19,330 --> 02:49:19,570
JL!

4291
02:49:19,670 --> 02:49:20,330
Thank you for the super chat!

4292
02:49:20,370 --> 02:49:20,590
Thank you!

4293
02:49:20,710 --> 02:49:21,110
Thank you!

4294
02:49:21,190 --> 02:49:22,130
It's just...

4295
02:49:22,130 --> 02:49:22,690
Oh wait!

4296
02:49:22,810 --> 02:49:23,770
Next thing, thank you for the super chat!

4297
02:49:23,810 --> 02:49:24,310
Thank you!

4298
02:49:24,310 --> 02:49:27,090
I never thought I missed the days of licking things on combat.

4299
02:49:28,210 --> 02:49:29,830
CV, thank you to the super chat.

4300
02:49:29,970 --> 02:49:30,630
Thank you, thank you.

4301
02:49:30,850 --> 02:49:32,170
What did we learn today?

4302
02:49:32,350 --> 02:49:34,970
If the first shadow's not turned out correctly...

4303
02:49:34,970 --> 02:49:37,630
You just found them and replaced them with the...

4304
02:49:37,630 --> 02:49:41,110
No, there's no replacement going on here.

4305
02:49:41,630 --> 02:49:43,750
You guys, we're always yellow.

4306
02:49:44,350 --> 02:49:45,730
You guys, we're always yellow.

4307
02:49:46,930 --> 02:49:48,330
What are you talking about?

4308
02:49:48,730 --> 02:49:51,270
This is your true form, guys.

4309
02:49:52,210 --> 02:49:54,630
I'm always up from home up here.

4310
02:49:54,770 --> 02:49:57,750
Don't know what to do, but fight my way up.

4311
02:49:58,610 --> 02:50:01,390
What you guys always looked like, chat.

4312
02:50:01,810 --> 02:50:05,170
Our whole plan was to always make you a yellow Yoshi.

4313
02:50:05,510 --> 02:50:07,550
Because you're a dragoon.

4314
02:50:08,050 --> 02:50:09,990
And dragoons are yellow.

4315
02:50:17,110 --> 02:50:18,930
As you're silly.

4316
02:50:21,330 --> 02:50:23,330
Malou, you're lying to me.

4317
02:50:26,110 --> 02:50:27,570
Look, it's you!

4318
02:50:29,790 --> 02:50:32,990
It's like when they replaced Fat Tony.

4319
02:50:33,650 --> 02:50:35,370
Space, thank you with the super chat.

4320
02:50:35,550 --> 02:50:36,610
Thank you, thank you.

4321
02:50:38,810 --> 02:50:40,650
Oh shit, I wasn't looking.

4322
02:50:44,490 --> 02:50:45,350
Oh, quiet.

4323
02:50:45,530 --> 02:50:45,950
Wait, what?

4324
02:50:46,010 --> 02:50:47,090
What did he take from me?

4325
02:50:48,130 --> 02:50:51,470
This feels like a would you love me if I was a worm.

4326
02:50:51,950 --> 02:50:53,270
Welsh, thank you with the super chat.

4327
02:50:53,410 --> 02:50:54,250
Thank you, thank you.

4328
02:50:58,300 --> 02:50:59,740
Oh my god, he's angry.

4329
02:51:01,620 --> 02:51:02,440
Nobody knows.

4330
02:51:02,840 --> 02:51:03,780
There was no crime.

4331
02:51:10,270 --> 02:51:10,710
Okay.

4332
02:51:11,170 --> 02:51:12,130
Yeah, throw him!

4333
02:51:19,220 --> 02:51:20,100
Alright, nice.

4334
02:51:20,700 --> 02:51:22,480
Was that maybe a bad decision?

4335
02:51:26,360 --> 02:51:27,540
Alright, we go this way.

4336
02:51:27,740 --> 02:51:29,100
We gotta get the other silver star.

4337
02:51:29,220 --> 02:51:29,820
Oh, there he is.

4338
02:51:31,660 --> 02:51:33,360
You're looking for a silver star?

4339
02:51:33,360 --> 02:51:34,780
Well, I have one.

4340
02:51:36,240 --> 02:51:37,260
I'll give it to you.

4341
02:51:37,380 --> 02:51:39,040
We can overcome my trial.

4342
02:51:40,500 --> 02:51:42,340
Except June 7th.

4343
02:51:42,740 --> 02:51:43,480
Never forget.

4344
02:51:45,400 --> 02:51:46,960
What are you guys talking about?

4345
02:51:47,200 --> 02:51:48,900
What happened on June 7th?

4346
02:51:49,160 --> 02:51:52,240
Oh, when we had such a great time playing Mario Mon, guys?

4347
02:51:53,500 --> 02:51:56,180
I licked my way into becoming you.

4348
02:51:56,620 --> 02:51:59,240
And all I got was a stupid box.

4349
02:52:02,560 --> 02:52:03,220
Oh, when...

4350
02:52:03,740 --> 02:52:05,080
Oh, when you guys...

4351
02:52:05,080 --> 02:52:06,980
When you guys evolved into Yellow Yoshi?

4352
02:52:07,220 --> 02:52:08,980
Oh yeah, that was a great time, guys.

4353
02:52:09,300 --> 02:52:11,600
That was a great time, everybody.

4354
02:52:14,820 --> 02:52:16,880
When you all evolved...

4355
02:52:16,880 --> 02:52:17,640
Oh my god.

4356
02:52:18,980 --> 02:52:20,200
Wow, great job.

4357
02:52:20,420 --> 02:52:21,640
Here you go, as promised.

4358
02:52:23,100 --> 02:52:24,580
Good times, good times.

4359
02:52:24,700 --> 02:52:25,500
Yes, good times.

4360
02:52:29,520 --> 02:52:29,980
yodhi is the redại Rand.

4361
02:52:34,320 --> 02:52:35,760
Busbol, thank you for the Super chat.

4362
02:52:35,940 --> 02:52:36,700
Thanks, thank you.

4363
02:52:36,840 --> 02:52:38,860
Yellow Yoshi is more meta than nube?

4364
02:52:39,120 --> 02:52:39,640
Apparently so.

4365
02:52:39,700 --> 02:52:41,720
I see this as an absolute win.

4366
02:52:42,440 --> 02:52:43,880
Lali, thank you for the Super chat.

4367
02:52:44,100 --> 02:52:44,900
Thank you, thank you.

4368
02:52:48,600 --> 02:52:50,640
Purple Dragoon replaced by yellow Dracoon.

4369
02:52:50,720 --> 02:52:52,500
Didn't have cognitive still!

4370
02:52:52,720 --> 02:52:54,280
Thank you for the super chat.

4371
02:52:54,280 --> 02:52:55,460
Thank you, thank you.

4372
02:52:58,540 --> 02:52:59,100
Yay!

4373
02:53:00,520 --> 02:53:01,640
Never punished.

4374
02:53:02,140 --> 02:53:04,260
Just, you know, thank you for the super chat.

4375
02:53:04,440 --> 02:53:05,380
Thank you, thank you.

4376
02:53:05,640 --> 02:53:06,600
The traitor.

4377
02:53:09,660 --> 02:53:12,900
Remember who you were, Simba.

4378
02:53:22,570 --> 02:53:24,730
Hey, those are silver stars.

4379
02:53:24,990 --> 02:53:25,970
Good job, Mario.

4380
02:53:26,630 --> 02:53:28,710
Mama will definitely be happy with those.

4381
02:53:29,110 --> 02:53:30,430
Alright, we'll go back now.

4382
02:53:30,430 --> 02:53:31,770
We have...

4383
02:53:31,770 --> 02:53:32,650
Okay, we gotta...

4384
02:53:33,070 --> 02:53:34,070
Okay, I have to...

4385
02:53:34,070 --> 02:53:37,070
I'm thinking I should buy more caps right now.

4386
02:53:40,800 --> 02:53:42,080
Alright, yeah, you know what, fuck it.

4387
02:53:42,140 --> 02:53:43,640
I'll buy more caps right now anyway.

4388
02:53:44,540 --> 02:53:45,400
Where was it?

4389
02:53:45,660 --> 02:53:46,540
Main Street?

4390
02:53:47,120 --> 02:53:48,300
Uh, oh yeah, here.

4391
02:53:48,840 --> 02:53:49,940
I think it was downtown.

4392
02:53:52,060 --> 02:53:53,260
Oh no, it wasn't.

4393
02:53:53,400 --> 02:53:54,860
It was...

4394
02:53:54,860 --> 02:53:56,080
here somewhere.

4395
02:53:56,820 --> 02:53:58,360
Where the fuck is that store?

4396
02:53:59,700 --> 02:54:01,160
I always get lost here.

4397
02:54:01,160 --> 02:54:01,560
Oh wait.

4398
02:54:01,840 --> 02:54:02,300
It's here, right?

4399
02:54:02,540 --> 02:54:03,680
This looks like a giant mall.

4400
02:54:04,260 --> 02:54:04,760
No.

4401
02:54:06,440 --> 02:54:07,220
Never mind.

4402
02:54:10,980 --> 02:54:12,500
Okay, it must be down here.

4403
02:54:12,980 --> 02:54:14,940
I remember it was like either upstairs or downstairs.

4404
02:54:18,400 --> 02:54:19,100
Okay, no.

4405
02:54:19,200 --> 02:54:19,980
That's the dance club.

4406
02:54:21,220 --> 02:54:22,540
Yeah, but like...

4407
02:54:22,540 --> 02:54:24,800
He sells like shitty caps though.

4408
02:54:25,040 --> 02:54:27,720
Wasn't like baseball caps stronger than the...

4409
02:54:27,720 --> 02:54:28,880
I don't remember.

4410
02:54:29,080 --> 02:54:29,220
I don't remember.

4411
02:54:29,220 --> 02:54:30,660
Was the baseball cap stronger?

4412
02:54:31,300 --> 02:54:31,900
Or...

4413
02:54:31,900 --> 02:54:32,820
The...

4414
02:54:32,820 --> 02:54:33,800
The...

4415
02:54:33,800 --> 02:54:34,420
Hard hat.

4416
02:54:35,540 --> 02:54:36,640
I couldn't...

4417
02:54:36,640 --> 02:54:37,020
Remember.

4418
02:54:39,460 --> 02:54:40,600
Helmet is stronger?

4419
02:54:40,800 --> 02:54:41,120
Oh!

4420
02:54:41,200 --> 02:54:41,680
It was?

4421
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:42,500
Oh, okay.

4422
02:54:42,740 --> 02:54:43,420
I didn't realize.

4423
02:54:43,860 --> 02:54:45,000
I couldn't tell.

4424
02:54:47,860 --> 02:54:49,340
Okay, we'll go to...

4425
02:54:49,340 --> 02:54:50,960
We'll go back to Luma then.

4426
02:54:52,400 --> 02:54:53,160
Okay.

4427
02:54:53,540 --> 02:54:54,320
We'll put...

4428
02:54:54,320 --> 02:54:55,760
We'll go back into the sky!

4429
02:54:59,480 --> 02:55:00,240
Hmm.

4430
02:55:05,370 --> 02:55:06,550
Okay, let's see.

4431
02:55:07,010 --> 02:55:07,530
Alright.

4432
02:55:07,990 --> 02:55:09,110
Okay, fine guys.

4433
02:55:11,190 --> 02:55:11,950
We'll...

4434
02:55:12,610 --> 02:55:13,270
Fine.

4435
02:55:13,610 --> 02:55:14,490
Fine, guys.

4436
02:55:14,910 --> 02:55:15,650
We'll let...

4437
02:55:18,190 --> 02:55:19,710
We'll put...

4438
02:55:20,490 --> 02:55:21,490
Oh my god.

4439
02:55:22,730 --> 02:55:23,370
Nevermind.

4440
02:55:23,730 --> 02:55:25,710
I looked at him again and...

4441
02:55:29,330 --> 02:55:31,610
Cat, I looked at him again and...

4442
02:55:31,610 --> 02:55:31,930
Cat.

4443
02:55:36,940 --> 02:55:39,260
Okay, we can't have two dragons though.

4444
02:55:39,520 --> 02:55:40,120
We can't...

4445
02:55:40,120 --> 02:55:41,040
I'm sorry.

4446
02:55:41,320 --> 02:55:41,640
I'm broken.

4447
02:55:44,860 --> 02:55:45,500
Yeah.

4448
02:55:48,840 --> 02:55:49,900
You were a hero.

4449
02:55:51,080 --> 02:55:52,680
I'll let you have some fun.

4450
02:55:52,880 --> 02:55:53,440
Hahaha.

4451
02:55:56,280 --> 02:55:56,840
Alright.

4452
02:55:58,800 --> 02:55:59,360
Alright.

4453
02:56:00,820 --> 02:56:01,960
Okay, but like...

4454
02:56:01,960 --> 02:56:04,080
If he has to be in the party...

4455
02:56:04,840 --> 02:56:05,880
If she has...

4456
02:56:05,880 --> 02:56:06,940
If he has...

4457
02:56:06,940 --> 02:56:07,220
Haha.

4458
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:12,560
Hahaha.

4459
02:56:33,940 --> 02:56:36,480
There he has to...

4460
02:56:37,160 --> 02:56:38,580
Dragoon.

4461
02:56:38,980 --> 02:56:39,120
Hahaha.

4462
02:56:42,280 --> 02:56:43,040
Dragoon.

4463
02:56:43,120 --> 02:56:44,600
Dot dot dot.

4464
02:56:44,820 --> 02:56:45,740
Dragoon.

4465
02:56:46,340 --> 02:56:46,540
Hahaha.

4466
02:56:46,540 --> 02:56:46,720
Hahaha.

4467
02:56:47,940 --> 02:56:48,120
Hahaha.

4468
02:56:48,580 --> 02:56:49,060
Hahaha.

4469
02:56:50,560 --> 02:56:51,000
Hahahaha.

4470
02:56:51,280 --> 02:56:51,740
Hahahaha.

4471
02:56:53,480 --> 02:56:53,960
That...

4472
02:56:54,680 --> 02:56:55,840
Oh, you're right!

4473
02:56:56,100 --> 02:56:57,160
Wait, you're right!

4474
02:56:57,380 --> 02:56:58,280
Wait, you're right!

4475
02:56:58,400 --> 02:56:58,420
Wait, you're right.

4476
02:56:58,420 --> 02:56:58,840
I like that.

4477
02:56:59,100 --> 02:56:59,700
Wait, you're right.

4478
02:56:59,860 --> 02:57:00,720
Wait, I like that.

4479
02:57:03,800 --> 02:57:05,060
I like that too.

4480
02:57:05,960 --> 02:57:06,440
Hahaha.

4481
02:57:12,920 --> 02:57:14,320
Okay.

4482
02:57:17,920 --> 02:57:19,320
Dragoon?

4483
02:57:26,380 --> 02:57:28,700
Alright, so...

4484
02:57:28,700 --> 02:57:30,760
The OG Dragoon...

4485
02:57:31,280 --> 02:57:31,920
And then...

4486
02:57:31,920 --> 02:57:34,240
Dragoon...

4487
02:57:34,240 --> 02:57:35,420
Even better!

4488
02:57:36,880 --> 02:57:37,440
Alright.

4489
02:57:40,180 --> 02:57:42,680
I can knowledge as money!

4490
02:57:43,420 --> 02:57:43,980
Money!

4491
02:57:44,360 --> 02:57:47,240
You raised us from a baby!

4492
02:57:47,880 --> 02:57:50,020
Mother, what is this?

4493
02:57:50,180 --> 02:57:50,940
What do you mean?

4494
02:57:54,620 --> 02:57:55,560
Alright, nice.

4495
02:57:55,720 --> 02:57:56,040
That's all.

4496
02:57:56,300 --> 02:57:58,080
I'll use all my money on helmets.

4497
02:58:05,050 --> 02:58:05,610
Alright.

4498
02:58:06,790 --> 02:58:08,150
Yeah, thank you for the super chat!

4499
02:58:08,270 --> 02:58:09,010
Thank you!

4500
02:58:09,010 --> 02:58:09,850
Hey Mario!

4501
02:58:10,150 --> 02:58:11,790
How many about Star Bits yet?

4502
02:58:12,030 --> 02:58:13,550
Us Lumas love them!

4503
02:58:13,670 --> 02:58:14,930
Oh, it's like ice now.

4504
02:58:15,490 --> 02:58:16,190
I just look up you.

4505
02:58:16,450 --> 02:58:19,730
Apparently he's in the Mario and Luigi RPG game.

4506
02:58:19,830 --> 02:58:22,710
And you have to play a majority of his screen time inside his belly.

4507
02:58:22,850 --> 02:58:24,190
It's so weird, very fast as you care.

4508
02:58:24,330 --> 02:58:26,910
So this is what you want representing you guys, Dragoon.

4509
02:58:27,130 --> 02:58:29,290
Is that what you want to represent you guys?

4510
02:58:29,290 --> 02:58:30,790
A little boar freak?

4511
02:58:31,410 --> 02:58:32,290
Is that what you want?

4512
02:58:35,490 --> 02:58:36,650
No, yes.

4513
02:58:37,570 --> 02:58:39,370
There are two Dragoons.

4514
02:58:41,930 --> 02:58:43,130
Never mind.

4515
02:58:43,550 --> 02:58:44,750
That's not us.

4516
02:58:45,250 --> 02:58:46,290
Is that what you wanted?

4517
02:58:46,610 --> 02:58:48,630
You guys wanted to be little freaks?

4518
02:58:52,470 --> 02:58:53,210
What you wanted to greet me.

4519
02:58:53,210 --> 02:58:54,610
Why can't you love us?

4520
02:58:55,710 --> 02:58:57,730
No key, Mother!

4521
02:58:58,670 --> 02:59:00,510
Why can't you love us?

4522
02:59:00,630 --> 02:59:03,130
Why are you king shaming us, Mother?

4523
02:59:09,270 --> 02:59:11,170
Delsa, thank you for the super chat.

4524
02:59:11,330 --> 02:59:12,110
Thank you, thank you.

4525
02:59:12,410 --> 02:59:15,430
You, Dragoon, I am what you made me.

4526
02:59:16,010 --> 02:59:17,250
Oh, fuck, I forgot.

4527
02:59:17,490 --> 02:59:19,470
I forgot fighting doesn't do anything.

4528
02:59:27,710 --> 02:59:34,710
Look, alright, I want to see what you... alright, let's send out dot dot dot Dragoon.

4529
02:59:37,050 --> 02:59:39,550
I want to see what it looks like in the back.

4530
02:59:40,270 --> 02:59:41,410
I need to know.

4531
02:59:41,410 --> 02:59:42,630
Oh my god.

4532
02:59:43,190 --> 02:59:45,430
Only the head shows up.

4533
02:59:47,370 --> 02:59:52,430
You're so big that only... only the head shows up right now.

4534
02:59:55,170 --> 02:59:57,150
Oh, it doesn't affect... he's too big.

4535
03:00:00,090 --> 03:00:01,930
He's too fucking big.

4536
03:00:05,550 --> 03:00:06,310
What?

4537
03:00:06,530 --> 03:00:07,330
Nothing works?

4538
03:00:14,910 --> 03:00:17,670
Okay, apparently you can only let...

4539
03:00:17,670 --> 03:00:20,910
Oh my god, what are you?

4540
03:00:21,350 --> 03:00:23,710
Oh my god, you can't even...

4541
03:00:23,710 --> 03:00:26,830
Oh my god, you can't even escape!

4542
03:00:32,160 --> 03:00:36,120
I can't even... I can't set any...

4543
03:00:38,550 --> 03:00:38,710
Why?

4544
03:00:39,050 --> 03:00:40,510
You actually just...

4545
03:00:46,210 --> 03:00:48,010
Oh nice, I have the Dragontail.

4546
03:00:48,170 --> 03:00:48,830
Okay, thank god.

4547
03:00:49,810 --> 03:00:50,470
Oh, thank god.

4548
03:00:52,110 --> 03:00:53,350
I have Dragontail.

4549
03:00:53,430 --> 03:00:54,150
I have one more move.

4550
03:00:54,290 --> 03:00:55,730
I have one more move.

4551
03:00:57,950 --> 03:00:59,110
What the fuck?

4552
03:01:02,460 --> 03:01:02,720
What the fuck?

4553
03:01:02,780 --> 03:01:03,400
Okay.

4554
03:01:04,260 --> 03:01:04,740
Nice.

4555
03:01:05,040 --> 03:01:06,200
Okay, it's normal, ghost.

4556
03:01:06,360 --> 03:01:07,080
Okay, we're back.

4557
03:01:07,500 --> 03:01:08,520
We're back.

4558
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:11,360
Jesus Christ, STOP!

4559
03:01:15,080 --> 03:01:16,500
Okay, it's over.

4560
03:01:20,950 --> 03:01:21,890
Oh, thank god.

4561
03:01:22,070 --> 03:01:22,690
My child.

4562
03:01:23,550 --> 03:01:24,710
My real child.

4563
03:01:25,230 --> 03:01:25,590
My...

4564
03:01:26,190 --> 03:01:26,690
Leveled up.

4565
03:01:26,850 --> 03:01:28,050
My real child leveled up.

4566
03:01:28,570 --> 03:01:28,970
Thank god.

4567
03:01:32,530 --> 03:01:33,470
Oh, it's Penguin!

4568
03:01:33,790 --> 03:01:34,150
What the fuck?

4569
03:01:34,190 --> 03:01:35,010
Why do you look like that?

4570
03:01:35,090 --> 03:01:36,990
Why do you look at me like that with those eyes?

4571
03:01:37,330 --> 03:01:38,770
Why does he look...

4572
03:01:38,770 --> 03:01:39,250
Whoa!

4573
03:01:40,470 --> 03:01:41,230
Like, hey.

4574
03:01:41,590 --> 03:01:43,450
I heard there's a spot open right now.

4575
03:01:45,850 --> 03:01:47,050
Alright, let's be Penguin.

4576
03:01:47,950 --> 03:01:48,690
Oh, yeah.

4577
03:01:48,790 --> 03:01:50,650
Why is she looking at us like that?

4578
03:01:52,970 --> 03:01:54,290
She knows what you did.

4579
03:01:54,510 --> 03:01:54,770
Yo!

4580
03:01:55,530 --> 03:01:56,550
Why is it like...

4581
03:01:56,550 --> 03:01:57,850
Why is it like...

4582
03:01:57,850 --> 03:01:58,410
Why is it looking at me like that?

4583
03:01:58,650 --> 03:01:59,170
Exactly!

4584
03:02:00,970 --> 03:02:02,010
Noot, noot.

4585
03:02:04,830 --> 03:02:05,610
Oh, my.

4586
03:02:07,110 --> 03:02:07,630
Alright.

4587
03:02:09,090 --> 03:02:11,230
She knows what I did.

4588
03:02:13,510 --> 03:02:14,170
Oh, yeah.

4589
03:02:14,270 --> 03:02:15,670
I said I would give Demon one.

4590
03:02:15,850 --> 03:02:16,470
Okay, Demon.

4591
03:02:17,930 --> 03:02:18,370
Demon.

4592
03:02:18,450 --> 03:02:18,890
Demon...

4593
03:02:19,510 --> 03:02:19,950
Goon.

4594
03:02:23,290 --> 03:02:24,310
Alright, there you go.

4595
03:02:29,720 --> 03:02:30,120
Okay.

4596
03:02:31,180 --> 03:02:31,660
Oh, wait.

4597
03:02:31,700 --> 03:02:32,880
I wanna go back here.

4598
03:02:32,940 --> 03:02:35,340
There's something up here that I saw.

4599
03:02:35,480 --> 03:02:36,240
Yeah, there was an item.

4600
03:02:36,860 --> 03:02:37,120
Fuck.

4601
03:02:37,520 --> 03:02:39,440
I keep walking into the tree for some reason.

4602
03:02:41,160 --> 03:02:42,680
Yeah, that's a demon, alright.

4603
03:02:42,980 --> 03:02:43,160
Yeah.

4604
03:02:47,020 --> 03:02:47,460
Okay.

4605
03:02:47,460 --> 03:02:48,040
Oh, it's an aluma.

4606
03:02:48,820 --> 03:02:48,840
Oh,

4607
03:02:53,690 --> 03:02:53,690
it's an aluma.

4608
03:02:54,410 --> 03:02:55,810
Get out of here, dad.

4609
03:02:58,630 --> 03:02:59,070
Okay.

4610
03:02:59,530 --> 03:03:00,410
Oh, is this ice?

4611
03:03:00,830 --> 03:03:01,610
It is.

4612
03:03:01,830 --> 03:03:03,090
Okay, I gotta figure this out.

4613
03:03:06,070 --> 03:03:06,850
Okay, no.

4614
03:03:07,490 --> 03:03:08,870
I have to hit that area.

4615
03:03:09,030 --> 03:03:09,790
Okay, that's easy.

4616
03:03:10,470 --> 03:03:12,090
Never melt ice.

4617
03:03:12,310 --> 03:03:12,530
Yes.

4618
03:03:13,810 --> 03:03:14,190
Ew.

4619
03:03:15,230 --> 03:03:16,830
You're looking for a silver star?

4620
03:03:17,050 --> 03:03:18,770
Well, I have one.

4621
03:03:19,110 --> 03:03:19,970
I'll give it to you.

4622
03:03:20,050 --> 03:03:21,810
You can overcome my trial.

4623
03:03:23,850 --> 03:03:24,970
Alright, that's fine.

4624
03:03:24,970 --> 03:03:25,390
I'm dead.

4625
03:03:25,730 --> 03:03:26,670
You can melt anything.

4626
03:03:31,600 --> 03:03:32,420
Oh, shit.

4627
03:03:32,420 --> 03:03:33,100
He's empowered.

4628
03:03:33,920 --> 03:03:34,120
Oh, shit.

4629
03:03:38,100 --> 03:03:39,120
Oh, my God.

4630
03:03:39,120 --> 03:03:40,520
Look how strong he feels.

4631
03:03:42,060 --> 03:03:43,020
There's nothing.

4632
03:03:43,020 --> 03:03:45,220
I have fire on my side.

4633
03:03:45,540 --> 03:03:46,460
That's right.

4634
03:03:48,420 --> 03:03:48,960
Yeah.

4635
03:03:49,200 --> 03:03:50,000
Wasted me...

4636
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:52,760
Wasted 10 seconds of my life watching all the stats.

4637
03:03:54,640 --> 03:03:55,400
Oh, wait.

4638
03:03:55,520 --> 03:03:55,960
That's it?

4639
03:03:55,980 --> 03:03:56,620
You only have one.

4640
03:03:57,540 --> 03:03:57,980
Wow.

4641
03:03:58,220 --> 03:03:58,780
Great job.

4642
03:03:59,000 --> 03:04:00,160
Here you go, as promised.

4643
03:04:00,160 --> 03:04:02,140
Okay, he did not try that hard.

4644
03:04:02,620 --> 03:04:03,700
He literally only had...

4645
03:04:03,700 --> 03:04:03,900
Yeah.

4646
03:04:04,200 --> 03:04:07,860
I waited 10 seconds for that stupid power-up shit.

4647
03:04:18,640 --> 03:04:20,920
Check out my super grounded team!

4648
03:04:25,400 --> 03:04:26,580
Okay, poison pee.

4649
03:04:26,640 --> 03:04:28,200
Okay, I don't think I can sit on that.

4650
03:04:28,380 --> 03:04:29,160
Wait, no, I can.

4651
03:04:30,420 --> 03:04:31,040
Wait, I should...

4652
03:04:31,040 --> 03:04:31,200
No.

4653
03:04:31,580 --> 03:04:32,780
We'll use Flare Blitz.

4654
03:04:33,180 --> 03:04:33,620
Actually.

4655
03:04:35,980 --> 03:04:38,820
I'll like let Dad's butt rest a little bit.

4656
03:04:39,780 --> 03:04:40,880
He deserves it.

4657
03:04:45,900 --> 03:04:46,680
Oh, shit.

4658
03:04:47,120 --> 03:04:48,140
Oh, he had the recoil.

4659
03:04:48,280 --> 03:04:48,620
I forgot.

4660
03:04:48,820 --> 03:04:49,800
I forgot it hurts him a little.

4661
03:04:51,200 --> 03:04:52,480
Let it rest a little bit.

4662
03:04:52,700 --> 03:04:53,940
He's been doing a lot of work.

4663
03:04:57,530 --> 03:04:58,330
Oh, shit.

4664
03:04:58,490 --> 03:04:59,390
Okay, there's...

4665
03:04:59,390 --> 03:04:59,870
You know what?

4666
03:05:00,190 --> 03:05:00,730
You know what?

4667
03:05:00,730 --> 03:05:02,810
It's time to get a little freaky though.

4668
03:05:03,930 --> 03:05:04,250
Oh, okay.

4669
03:05:04,350 --> 03:05:04,710
Never mind.

4670
03:05:04,870 --> 03:05:05,230
Don't...

4671
03:05:07,370 --> 03:05:08,390
Don't do that.

4672
03:05:12,160 --> 03:05:12,960
Never mind.

4673
03:05:13,320 --> 03:05:14,020
Don't do that.

4674
03:05:14,760 --> 03:05:15,920
It wasn't worth it.

4675
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:21,360
Forgot to have that move.

4676
03:05:25,530 --> 03:05:26,690
First impression?

4677
03:05:27,050 --> 03:05:27,190
First impression?

4678
03:05:27,190 --> 03:05:27,530
What's that?

4679
03:05:29,590 --> 03:05:30,910
Only works...

4680
03:05:30,910 --> 03:05:31,430
Hits hard.

4681
03:05:31,770 --> 03:05:32,150
And first.

4682
03:05:32,350 --> 03:05:33,590
Only works first turn.

4683
03:05:37,390 --> 03:05:38,970
Is it worth it?

4684
03:05:39,450 --> 03:05:41,570
Does it not work in any other turn?

4685
03:05:43,210 --> 03:05:44,350
Wait, it's good?

4686
03:05:45,150 --> 03:05:47,490
Okay, I'll get rid of Skitter Smack then.

4687
03:05:49,390 --> 03:05:51,870
Yeah, you was not a good first impression.

4688
03:06:03,210 --> 03:06:05,370
First move every time it comes out.

4689
03:06:05,690 --> 03:06:06,470
Oh, okay.

4690
03:06:07,050 --> 03:06:07,530
Okay.

4691
03:06:08,290 --> 03:06:11,050
The only question is like, when does he ever get to come out?

4692
03:06:15,320 --> 03:06:15,920
Yay!

4693
03:06:16,940 --> 03:06:18,260
My beautiful child.

4694
03:06:19,300 --> 03:06:20,760
You leveled up.

4695
03:06:21,180 --> 03:06:22,340
My real son.

4696
03:06:26,260 --> 03:06:26,980
Man.

4697
03:06:27,480 --> 03:06:28,400
Good for him.

4698
03:06:28,880 --> 03:06:30,020
It's a snowy wonderland!

4699
03:06:30,560 --> 03:06:32,260
I'm freezing my calves off!

4700
03:06:35,560 --> 03:06:37,980
Oh, that's like a leveled up son.

4701
03:06:38,280 --> 03:06:39,000
Mother.

4702
03:06:43,040 --> 03:06:45,340
My first and only son.

4703
03:06:49,140 --> 03:06:50,860
We can't hear you.

4704
03:06:51,020 --> 03:06:52,140
Yes, you guys!

4705
03:06:58,540 --> 03:06:59,980
I only have one.

4706
03:07:00,840 --> 03:07:02,420
You're looking for a silver shark?

4707
03:07:02,620 --> 03:07:03,880
Well, I have one.

4708
03:07:04,060 --> 03:07:04,780
I'll give it to you.

4709
03:07:04,860 --> 03:07:06,260
You can overcome my trial.

4710
03:07:08,120 --> 03:07:08,920
Oh my god.

4711
03:07:09,080 --> 03:07:10,160
He knows what I said.

4712
03:07:10,820 --> 03:07:12,000
He knows what I said.

4713
03:07:12,140 --> 03:07:14,120
I know what you did last summer.

4714
03:07:20,140 --> 03:07:21,000
Oh my god.

4715
03:07:21,000 --> 03:07:23,440
It's another like five seconds of watching this.

4716
03:07:24,320 --> 03:07:24,920
Oh shit.

4717
03:07:24,920 --> 03:07:27,560
I was gonna be like, why do that when I can do this?

4718
03:07:27,660 --> 03:07:28,500
But he moved first.

4719
03:07:29,500 --> 03:07:30,520
What money?

4720
03:07:33,800 --> 03:07:35,000
Get down!

4721
03:07:37,140 --> 03:07:38,520
Get down from here.

4722
03:07:38,660 --> 03:07:39,100
Oh shit.

4723
03:07:39,320 --> 03:07:39,420
Wait.

4724
03:07:39,880 --> 03:07:40,780
He had focus sash.

4725
03:07:41,340 --> 03:07:42,320
Oh my god.

4726
03:07:43,280 --> 03:07:44,540
He believed in himself.

4727
03:07:49,380 --> 03:07:50,800
He went to sleep?

4728
03:07:51,520 --> 03:07:52,620
Wake up!

4729
03:07:53,240 --> 03:07:54,500
Are you fucking...

4730
03:07:54,500 --> 03:07:55,260
Oh my god.

4731
03:07:55,260 --> 03:07:56,520
Are you fucking kidding me?

4732
03:07:57,100 --> 03:07:59,680
I didn't realize it gave like, his full HP.

4733
03:08:00,880 --> 03:08:01,840
Oh, it didn't matter.

4734
03:08:02,120 --> 03:08:02,860
That's fucking right.

4735
03:08:03,000 --> 03:08:03,820
Get out of here.

4736
03:08:10,580 --> 03:08:11,640
Wow, great job.

4737
03:08:11,840 --> 03:08:12,860
Here you go, as promised.

4738
03:08:13,920 --> 03:08:15,300
Nice, I got a silver star.

4739
03:08:15,600 --> 03:08:15,840
Yay.

4740
03:08:16,680 --> 03:08:19,020
I wonder if there's any more mods I haven't caught yet.

4741
03:08:20,140 --> 03:08:21,260
Oh, it's a baby!

4742
03:08:21,400 --> 03:08:22,600
It's time to kidnap another child.

4743
03:08:24,400 --> 03:08:24,840
Nice.

4744
03:08:25,880 --> 03:08:28,000
Another child in my collection.

4745
03:08:28,360 --> 03:08:29,620
That I will adopt.

4746
03:08:29,900 --> 03:08:30,000
Sorry.

4747
03:08:30,260 --> 03:08:32,260
It's time to adopt another child, everybody!

4748
03:08:32,740 --> 03:08:33,100
Yay!

4749
03:08:33,740 --> 03:08:34,400
Oh my god.

4750
03:08:34,580 --> 03:08:34,700
See?

4751
03:08:34,940 --> 03:08:37,240
He wanted to be adopted, chat.

4752
03:08:38,060 --> 03:08:40,160
He wanted to be adopted.

4753
03:08:41,520 --> 03:08:43,160
Just a silly little guy.

4754
03:08:43,740 --> 03:08:46,720
He will say if you throw it off a cliff enough times, they may learn to fly.

4755
03:08:46,720 --> 03:08:49,060
People are dumb because penguins can't fly.

4756
03:08:49,740 --> 03:08:50,000
Yeah!

4757
03:08:51,280 --> 03:08:53,380
Alright, who wants to be a baby penguin?

4758
03:08:57,020 --> 03:08:59,020
I'm just giving them a new home.

4759
03:08:59,440 --> 03:09:03,580
Honestly, whoever used to take care of this child was a bad parent.

4760
03:09:03,920 --> 03:09:07,120
They let this child randomly talk to a stranger.

4761
03:09:07,960 --> 03:09:09,640
I wanna be a babe.

4762
03:09:12,240 --> 03:09:12,840
Alright.

4763
03:09:13,320 --> 03:09:14,000
Let's see.

4764
03:09:14,000 --> 03:09:14,460
Wait.

4765
03:09:14,620 --> 03:09:15,960
Does Broku have a...

4766
03:09:15,960 --> 03:09:16,600
Alright.

4767
03:09:16,980 --> 03:09:18,540
Broku have a...

4768
03:09:18,540 --> 03:09:19,360
Have one yet?

4769
03:09:20,760 --> 03:09:21,400
Bro...

4770
03:09:21,400 --> 03:09:21,760
Oh wait.

4771
03:09:22,280 --> 03:09:22,920
Actually...

4772
03:09:23,820 --> 03:09:24,140
Brogoon.

4773
03:09:28,220 --> 03:09:28,860
Brogoon.

4774
03:09:29,020 --> 03:09:29,300
Yep.

4775
03:09:34,020 --> 03:09:34,520
Wait.

4776
03:09:34,740 --> 03:09:35,940
Broku already had one?

4777
03:09:36,100 --> 03:09:36,460
Alright.

4778
03:09:36,720 --> 03:09:37,340
That's it.

4779
03:09:37,520 --> 03:09:38,320
Rename time.

4780
03:09:39,200 --> 03:09:40,880
You thought you could trick me.

4781
03:09:41,420 --> 03:09:43,740
You thought you could trick me.

4782
03:09:45,960 --> 03:09:48,800
Oh yeah, he shared one with the guy we banished.

4783
03:09:48,940 --> 03:09:49,240
I forgot.

4784
03:09:51,920 --> 03:09:52,440
Alright.

4785
03:09:52,440 --> 03:09:53,180
Where is he?

4786
03:09:55,440 --> 03:09:56,340
No, he didn't.

4787
03:09:56,440 --> 03:09:56,880
Oh wait, no.

4788
03:09:57,080 --> 03:09:57,480
He's fine.

4789
03:09:59,920 --> 03:10:00,720
Oh no.

4790
03:10:01,040 --> 03:10:02,440
Oh, they were spreading misinformation?

4791
03:10:03,000 --> 03:10:03,140
Oh.

4792
03:10:05,740 --> 03:10:06,260
Damn.

4793
03:10:07,340 --> 03:10:07,840
Bro...

4794
03:10:07,840 --> 03:10:10,060
Broku remember their names.

4795
03:10:10,060 --> 03:10:12,240
Remember their names.

4796
03:10:14,220 --> 03:10:15,420
Several goons.

4797
03:10:15,720 --> 03:10:16,100
Okay, no.

4798
03:10:16,200 --> 03:10:16,660
He's fine.

4799
03:10:17,500 --> 03:10:18,320
He's fine.

4800
03:10:18,320 --> 03:10:19,440
He doesn't have...

4801
03:10:19,440 --> 03:10:20,320
He doesn't have one.

4802
03:10:23,440 --> 03:10:24,740
Yeah, I'm double checking.

4803
03:10:27,280 --> 03:10:27,880
Alright.

4804
03:10:29,360 --> 03:10:30,800
Man has enemies.

4805
03:10:31,220 --> 03:10:31,620
Wait.

4806
03:10:31,820 --> 03:10:32,000
Wait.

4807
03:10:32,140 --> 03:10:32,420
Is he?

4808
03:10:33,360 --> 03:10:34,820
Oh, you lied!

4809
03:10:35,500 --> 03:10:35,760
Wait.

4810
03:10:36,400 --> 03:10:36,940
Okay.

4811
03:10:41,440 --> 03:10:42,640
Where are you?

4812
03:10:47,510 --> 03:10:48,810
Where are you?

4813
03:10:49,370 --> 03:10:51,510
You lied to all of us.

4814
03:10:56,870 --> 03:10:57,510
Wait.

4815
03:10:57,790 --> 03:10:58,530
In the...

4816
03:10:58,530 --> 03:10:59,770
The ugly thing?

4817
03:10:59,970 --> 03:11:00,510
Which one?

4818
03:11:06,670 --> 03:11:07,970
No, that's broken.

4819
03:11:08,230 --> 03:11:08,910
No, that's different.

4820
03:11:09,050 --> 03:11:10,050
That's different, guys.

4821
03:11:11,150 --> 03:11:11,790
That's...

4822
03:11:11,790 --> 03:11:13,090
That's broken bun.

4823
03:11:13,390 --> 03:11:14,410
That's broken bun.

4824
03:11:14,650 --> 03:11:15,290
This is different.

4825
03:11:15,290 --> 03:11:16,190
Okay.

4826
03:11:16,750 --> 03:11:17,670
Brogoon is different.

4827
03:11:17,810 --> 03:11:18,430
That's broku.

4828
03:11:19,270 --> 03:11:19,830
Wait.

4829
03:11:20,270 --> 03:11:22,170
Oh, remember your enemies.

4830
03:11:24,130 --> 03:11:24,910
It's okay.

4831
03:11:25,210 --> 03:11:25,870
It's okay.

4832
03:11:26,090 --> 03:11:27,390
You guys can't read just like me.

4833
03:11:27,950 --> 03:11:29,490
Now you know you're a actual...

4834
03:11:29,490 --> 03:11:30,550
You're a real dragoon.

4835
03:11:32,810 --> 03:11:34,170
Oh my god!

4836
03:11:34,210 --> 03:11:35,790
Look at those cheeks!

4837
03:11:36,850 --> 03:11:37,910
Oh my god!

4838
03:11:37,910 --> 03:11:39,470
He went through a lot of...

4839
03:11:39,470 --> 03:11:41,190
He definitely got a lot of fillers.

4840
03:11:45,480 --> 03:11:46,680
Oh, that's critical!

4841
03:11:48,440 --> 03:11:48,860
Oh, that's critical!

4842
03:11:48,860 --> 03:11:49,400
Look at those...

4843
03:11:49,400 --> 03:11:49,920
Those...

4844
03:11:49,920 --> 03:11:50,580
He's been...

4845
03:11:50,580 --> 03:11:51,740
Sucking up...

4846
03:11:51,740 --> 03:11:52,880
A lot of air.

4847
03:11:53,040 --> 03:11:53,800
That's for sure.

4848
03:11:53,920 --> 03:11:55,220
And only air, guys.

4849
03:11:56,860 --> 03:11:57,340
Um...

4850
03:11:57,340 --> 03:12:00,280
Blustery cloud with winds strong enough to move toads.

4851
03:12:00,500 --> 03:12:02,180
Be careful when traveling on the clouds.

4852
03:12:02,520 --> 03:12:04,400
Stepping on can be a one-way trick back...

4853
03:12:04,900 --> 03:12:06,080
Back to the surface.

4854
03:12:06,780 --> 03:12:07,380
Alright.

4855
03:12:07,680 --> 03:12:08,740
Who wants to be Typhu?

4856
03:12:09,820 --> 03:12:11,260
This guy has a lot of experience.

4857
03:12:17,700 --> 03:12:20,060
He has a lot of experience, guys.

4858
03:12:21,800 --> 03:12:22,680
Not me?

4859
03:12:27,230 --> 03:12:28,430
Message retracted!

4860
03:12:30,130 --> 03:12:31,330
He said...

4861
03:12:31,330 --> 03:12:31,710
Not me?

4862
03:12:32,010 --> 03:12:32,770
And then you...

4863
03:12:33,190 --> 03:12:34,530
Removed your message?

4864
03:12:34,970 --> 03:12:35,430
And...

4865
03:12:36,830 --> 03:12:37,430
Okay.

4866
03:12:39,430 --> 03:12:39,730
Clamacoon.

4867
03:12:40,430 --> 03:12:40,710
Alright.

4868
03:12:40,890 --> 03:12:41,370
There we go.

4869
03:12:45,350 --> 03:12:47,210
You knew what you were getting into.

4870
03:12:50,170 --> 03:12:51,150
Oh, another one.

4871
03:12:51,590 --> 03:12:52,070
Man.

4872
03:12:52,370 --> 03:12:53,490
Oh, they heard about my club.

4873
03:13:02,000 --> 03:13:02,520
Alright.

4874
03:13:03,380 --> 03:13:04,500
One more star.

4875
03:13:12,520 --> 03:13:13,540
Alright, camper.

4876
03:13:14,200 --> 03:13:14,820
Mega mole.

4877
03:13:15,100 --> 03:13:16,020
Get out of here.

4878
03:13:16,180 --> 03:13:17,180
Oh, he looks so cool though.

4879
03:13:17,300 --> 03:13:17,540
He has...

4880
03:13:17,540 --> 03:13:20,060
Oh, he has little sunglasses on!

4881
03:13:20,400 --> 03:13:21,140
He's so cool.

4882
03:13:21,880 --> 03:13:22,160
Alright.

4883
03:13:22,300 --> 03:13:22,840
Sit on it.

4884
03:13:26,640 --> 03:13:27,160
Yay!

4885
03:13:35,070 --> 03:13:36,330
Oh, another laticle?

4886
03:13:38,050 --> 03:13:38,810
It's okay.

4887
03:13:39,110 --> 03:13:40,090
We can still...

4888
03:13:40,090 --> 03:13:41,010
Nothing is...

4889
03:13:41,010 --> 03:13:42,330
Nothing is unsinnable.

4890
03:13:53,320 --> 03:13:54,020
Wait.

4891
03:13:54,880 --> 03:13:56,540
Was it actually unsinnable?

4892
03:13:58,720 --> 03:13:59,940
Wait a minute.

4893
03:14:00,800 --> 03:14:01,500
No!

4894
03:14:02,380 --> 03:14:03,520
Okay, nice, nice.

4895
03:14:05,880 --> 03:14:07,440
Oh, he flinched.

4896
03:14:07,560 --> 03:14:08,100
Oh, okay.

4897
03:14:09,380 --> 03:14:10,900
I was gonna be like...

4898
03:14:10,900 --> 03:14:11,080
Wait.

4899
03:14:12,100 --> 03:14:14,040
Was it actually unsinnable?

4900
03:14:14,160 --> 03:14:14,660
What happened?

4901
03:14:19,260 --> 03:14:20,800
Okay, we actually gotta swap.

4902
03:14:20,800 --> 03:14:21,680
Alright.

4903
03:14:22,600 --> 03:14:23,520
Oh, you're setting up.

4904
03:14:23,640 --> 03:14:24,020
Don't worry.

4905
03:14:24,240 --> 03:14:26,540
I'll make you big and strong soon, Dragoon.

4906
03:14:27,000 --> 03:14:27,900
Don't worry.

4907
03:14:28,880 --> 03:14:31,560
I'll make you be my strongest child.

4908
03:14:37,990 --> 03:14:38,830
What is...

4909
03:14:38,830 --> 03:14:39,670
How about Miromash?

4910
03:14:39,790 --> 03:14:41,190
Does Miromash do you well with this?

4911
03:14:44,050 --> 03:14:45,850
Oh, never mind.

4912
03:14:46,830 --> 03:14:48,090
What about Magnet?

4913
03:14:52,520 --> 03:14:53,100
What?

4914
03:14:53,100 --> 03:14:54,740
Oh, if that wasn't one HP.

4915
03:14:59,380 --> 03:15:00,600
Alright, Magnet Bomb.

4916
03:15:00,920 --> 03:15:02,320
I don't know the types for this.

4917
03:15:05,140 --> 03:15:05,980
Oh fuck.

4918
03:15:06,220 --> 03:15:06,880
Okay, I'm using...

4919
03:15:06,880 --> 03:15:08,340
I'm literally using every...

4920
03:15:08,340 --> 03:15:10,380
I'm using every move that's bad.

4921
03:15:13,400 --> 03:15:14,220
That's okay.

4922
03:15:16,120 --> 03:15:16,680
Okay.

4923
03:15:16,680 --> 03:15:17,040
Air slash.

4924
03:15:18,020 --> 03:15:19,680
Eventually, something will work.

4925
03:15:20,720 --> 03:15:21,580
Oh, okay.

4926
03:15:21,780 --> 03:15:22,540
Oh, that's awkward.

4927
03:15:23,020 --> 03:15:24,480
That's... Oh, that's awkward.

4928
03:15:24,800 --> 03:15:25,060
Whoops.

4929
03:15:29,200 --> 03:15:30,120
Oh, my God.

4930
03:15:30,240 --> 03:15:31,320
That would have been perfect.

4931
03:15:31,680 --> 03:15:34,560
That would have been perfect for this, but I can't.

4932
03:15:34,800 --> 03:15:36,040
He's literally won.

4933
03:15:37,480 --> 03:15:39,580
I can't risk it, guys.

4934
03:15:41,240 --> 03:15:42,540
We'll just brute force it.

4935
03:15:42,660 --> 03:15:42,920
No!

4936
03:15:43,200 --> 03:15:43,540
Crazy!

4937
03:15:44,520 --> 03:15:45,080
Crazy!

4938
03:15:45,180 --> 03:15:45,980
What the...

4939
03:15:45,980 --> 03:15:46,420
Sleep!

4940
03:15:47,000 --> 03:15:48,320
I'm fucking cursed.

4941
03:15:48,680 --> 03:15:49,080
It's okay.

4942
03:15:49,380 --> 03:15:50,920
Because he went to sleep.

4943
03:15:51,180 --> 03:15:52,780
That means I can swap.

4944
03:15:54,480 --> 03:15:55,200
All right, Dad.

4945
03:15:55,320 --> 03:15:55,760
This is it.

4946
03:15:56,320 --> 03:15:56,940
He's asleep.

4947
03:15:57,960 --> 03:15:58,960
He's asleep.

4948
03:15:59,400 --> 03:16:00,320
This is your chance.

4949
03:16:03,800 --> 03:16:04,640
No!

4950
03:16:09,680 --> 03:16:11,200
No way!

4951
03:16:11,820 --> 03:16:13,520
He played me!

4952
03:16:16,930 --> 03:16:18,890
Oh, my God!

4953
03:16:19,210 --> 03:16:21,810
He played me like a fool!

4954
03:16:34,580 --> 03:16:35,300
It's all right.

4955
03:16:35,660 --> 03:16:36,200
Oh.

4956
03:16:37,080 --> 03:16:37,440
All right.

4957
03:16:37,620 --> 03:16:38,120
Never mind.

4958
03:16:38,380 --> 03:16:39,200
It's not okay.

4959
03:16:40,060 --> 03:16:41,040
Never mind.

4960
03:16:41,260 --> 03:16:42,040
Oh, shit.

4961
03:16:42,180 --> 03:16:42,960
It's red, Yoshi.

4962
03:16:43,840 --> 03:16:44,340
All right.

4963
03:16:44,860 --> 03:16:45,420
Don't worry.

4964
03:16:46,080 --> 03:16:47,640
The battle of the Yoshis.

4965
03:16:48,360 --> 03:16:52,180
I can't believe he played me like a fucking fool.

4966
03:16:56,000 --> 03:16:56,640
Yoshi!

4967
03:17:04,640 --> 03:17:05,480
All right.

4968
03:17:05,820 --> 03:17:06,880
What else is there?

4969
03:17:09,700 --> 03:17:11,100
His club again.

4970
03:17:11,300 --> 03:17:12,460
His club again.

4971
03:17:12,800 --> 03:17:12,940
It's his club again.

4972
03:17:13,200 --> 03:17:13,640
Oh, my God.

4973
03:17:13,680 --> 03:17:14,480
I don't know who to...

4974
03:17:14,480 --> 03:17:14,720
Okay.

4975
03:17:14,880 --> 03:17:15,340
Stick bug.

4976
03:17:15,800 --> 03:17:18,400
Surely, stick bug will do okay against steel, right?

4977
03:17:22,570 --> 03:17:23,630
I don't know.

4978
03:17:24,410 --> 03:17:25,950
I don't... First impression.

4979
03:17:31,440 --> 03:17:32,040
Oh.

4980
03:17:32,040 --> 03:17:32,640
Oh.

4981
03:17:33,260 --> 03:17:33,860
Oh.

4982
03:17:34,820 --> 03:17:35,420
Oh.

4983
03:17:35,620 --> 03:17:36,220
Oh.

4984
03:17:36,780 --> 03:17:36,780
Oh.

4985
03:17:36,800 --> 03:17:37,820
That's awkward.

4986
03:17:38,900 --> 03:17:39,620
Drain punch.

4987
03:17:39,760 --> 03:17:39,780
Drain punch.

4988
03:17:39,780 --> 03:17:40,020
You're right.

4989
03:17:40,200 --> 03:17:40,600
Drain punch.

4990
03:17:44,290 --> 03:17:44,950
That's okay.

4991
03:17:45,070 --> 03:17:46,650
We got... We got a fighting move.

4992
03:17:49,630 --> 03:17:50,150
Oh.

4993
03:17:50,150 --> 03:17:50,470
Oh.

4994
03:17:50,470 --> 03:17:50,930
Thank God.

4995
03:17:51,110 --> 03:17:51,270
Okay.

4996
03:17:51,610 --> 03:17:51,910
Nice.

4997
03:17:53,130 --> 03:17:53,970
Things are okay.

4998
03:17:57,430 --> 03:17:58,930
Here goes my fire.

4999
03:18:01,610 --> 03:18:02,210
All right.

5000
03:18:02,310 --> 03:18:03,570
Things are okay, guys.

5001
03:18:03,870 --> 03:18:05,270
Nothing to worry about.

5002
03:18:05,270 --> 03:18:07,830
And we got a star piece, too.

5003
03:18:08,970 --> 03:18:09,190
All right.

5004
03:18:09,370 --> 03:18:10,030
Let's see.

5005
03:18:10,990 --> 03:18:13,770
All right.

5006
03:18:16,630 --> 03:18:18,110
All right.

5007
03:18:18,370 --> 03:18:18,830
I believe.

5008
03:18:19,970 --> 03:18:21,210
You know what?

5009
03:18:21,450 --> 03:18:22,150
Stick bug.

5010
03:18:22,410 --> 03:18:23,370
This is your time.

5011
03:18:25,190 --> 03:18:27,450
This is your time, stick bug.

5012
03:18:27,950 --> 03:18:28,950
Right here.

5013
03:18:29,550 --> 03:18:30,590
Right now.

5014
03:18:32,650 --> 03:18:34,130
You're looking for a silver star?

5015
03:18:34,370 --> 03:18:35,150
Well, I have one.

5016
03:18:35,390 --> 03:18:37,150
I'll give it to you who can overcome my trial.

5017
03:18:37,750 --> 03:18:38,530
I should warn you, though.

5018
03:18:38,830 --> 03:18:41,110
This trial is unlike the other ones you face.

5019
03:18:41,510 --> 03:18:43,750
Also, you'll be allowed to try and catch this one.

5020
03:18:44,030 --> 03:18:45,790
Are you properly prepared?

5021
03:18:46,190 --> 03:18:46,910
That's right.

5022
03:18:47,210 --> 03:18:49,090
I have stick bug.

5023
03:18:54,720 --> 03:18:55,200
Okay.

5024
03:18:55,940 --> 03:18:58,740
There's no way stick bug can kill him.

5025
03:19:02,600 --> 03:19:03,760
The first impression.

5026
03:19:04,040 --> 03:19:04,700
There's no way.

5027
03:19:06,320 --> 03:19:07,100
Oh, my God.

5028
03:19:07,120 --> 03:19:07,880
There's so many.

5029
03:19:08,280 --> 03:19:08,920
Oh, there's so...

5030
03:19:08,920 --> 03:19:09,080
Okay.

5031
03:19:09,180 --> 03:19:09,680
There you go.

5032
03:19:11,060 --> 03:19:11,680
You'll live.

5033
03:19:13,860 --> 03:19:14,700
Oh, thank God.

5034
03:19:14,840 --> 03:19:14,960
Okay.

5035
03:19:15,040 --> 03:19:15,360
That's good.

5036
03:19:15,420 --> 03:19:15,940
That's good, guys.

5037
03:19:16,060 --> 03:19:16,520
That's good.

5038
03:19:16,780 --> 03:19:17,320
That's good.

5039
03:19:17,440 --> 03:19:17,940
He lived.

5040
03:19:18,540 --> 03:19:18,940
Guys.

5041
03:19:21,320 --> 03:19:21,720
Okay.

5042
03:19:21,880 --> 03:19:22,620
He didn't live.

5043
03:19:26,980 --> 03:19:27,380
Okay.

5044
03:19:28,920 --> 03:19:29,880
That's awkward.

5045
03:19:32,300 --> 03:19:33,920
Oh, that's a little awkward.

5046
03:19:38,200 --> 03:19:39,200
That's a little awkward.

5047
03:19:39,280 --> 03:19:39,600
It's okay.

5048
03:19:39,760 --> 03:19:40,080
It's okay.

5049
03:19:40,280 --> 03:19:42,000
I can catch him now, right?

5050
03:19:44,080 --> 03:19:44,920
Oh, shit.

5051
03:19:45,100 --> 03:19:45,240
Okay.

5052
03:19:45,340 --> 03:19:46,120
He's a little strong.

5053
03:19:46,760 --> 03:19:48,380
Oh, and then he's gonna heal himself.

5054
03:19:48,680 --> 03:19:48,840
Oh.

5055
03:19:49,940 --> 03:19:50,320
Wow.

5056
03:19:50,620 --> 03:19:51,140
Stick bug.

5057
03:19:51,380 --> 03:19:52,380
It's like dying.

5058
03:19:52,960 --> 03:19:55,240
Dying did not mean much.

5059
03:19:55,760 --> 03:19:56,160
Oh.

5060
03:19:57,560 --> 03:19:58,020
Whoa.

5061
03:19:59,180 --> 03:20:00,000
That's awkward.

5062
03:20:00,260 --> 03:20:01,380
Oh, and then he hexes me.

5063
03:20:01,520 --> 03:20:02,000
Okay, cool.

5064
03:20:08,250 --> 03:20:08,710
Okay.

5065
03:20:08,970 --> 03:20:10,170
I can do two more hits.

5066
03:20:15,240 --> 03:20:15,860
All right.

5067
03:20:15,960 --> 03:20:17,160
He's full HP again.

5068
03:20:18,740 --> 03:20:19,200
Okay.

5069
03:20:20,580 --> 03:20:21,500
That's fine.

5070
03:20:29,450 --> 03:20:31,090
Surely I can do a meteor map.

5071
03:20:31,190 --> 03:20:31,890
Okay, I can't.

5072
03:20:32,030 --> 03:20:32,390
He's dead.

5073
03:20:36,290 --> 03:20:36,750
Oh.

5074
03:20:37,490 --> 03:20:38,030
Ooh.

5075
03:20:39,430 --> 03:20:40,070
Ah.

5076
03:20:40,770 --> 03:20:41,210
Okay.

5077
03:20:41,530 --> 03:20:42,050
That's fine.

5078
03:20:44,630 --> 03:20:46,190
Just tank it.

5079
03:20:53,980 --> 03:20:55,420
Don't kill it.

5080
03:20:56,300 --> 03:20:57,340
Oh, it's okay.

5081
03:20:57,360 --> 03:20:58,060
You'll just die.

5082
03:20:58,240 --> 03:20:58,360
Okay.

5083
03:20:58,440 --> 03:20:58,860
Never mind.

5084
03:20:59,340 --> 03:20:59,520
Never.

5085
03:21:04,540 --> 03:21:07,080
Oh, that's awkward.

5086
03:21:08,560 --> 03:21:09,460
Oh.

5087
03:21:10,180 --> 03:21:10,960
It's okay.

5088
03:21:11,400 --> 03:21:12,900
You're not gonna live.

5089
03:21:13,140 --> 03:21:13,820
But like...

5090
03:21:15,260 --> 03:21:16,540
You'll just...

5091
03:21:16,540 --> 03:21:18,500
Just be here to like...

5092
03:21:18,500 --> 03:21:18,860
No.

5093
03:21:19,340 --> 03:21:20,140
No.

5094
03:21:24,320 --> 03:21:25,760
Oh, no.

5095
03:21:26,660 --> 03:21:28,180
Oh, no.

5096
03:21:30,980 --> 03:21:32,400
Oh, no.

5097
03:21:32,480 --> 03:21:32,720
My mother.

5098
03:21:34,000 --> 03:21:34,680
Ah!

5099
03:21:34,880 --> 03:21:35,940
My son!

5100
03:21:36,380 --> 03:21:38,400
I knew you could do it!

5101
03:21:38,660 --> 03:21:39,000
My

5102
03:21:43,050 --> 03:21:43,910
real...

5103
03:21:43,910 --> 03:21:44,830
Ah!

5104
03:21:45,930 --> 03:21:47,350
I knew it!

5105
03:21:49,090 --> 03:21:52,590
An ice mage with a heart as cold as his demeanor.

5106
03:21:53,070 --> 03:21:57,430
It is quick to show off its chilly powers by freezing enemies immediately.

5107
03:21:59,550 --> 03:22:03,230
I knew you could do it, my real son.

5108
03:22:08,850 --> 03:22:09,370
Alright.

5109
03:22:11,130 --> 03:22:13,990
Alright, who wants to be the Crystal K?

5110
03:22:17,210 --> 03:22:17,990
What do you mean?

5111
03:22:18,090 --> 03:22:18,690
He got us!

5112
03:22:18,750 --> 03:22:20,010
He got us Crystal K!

5113
03:22:20,250 --> 03:22:20,890
He did it!

5114
03:22:26,670 --> 03:22:27,870
Alright, let's see.

5115
03:22:31,310 --> 03:22:31,830
Hmm...

5116
03:22:33,770 --> 03:22:34,310
Yeah!

5117
03:22:34,410 --> 03:22:36,590
I have a favorite child, because I only have one child!

5118
03:22:41,070 --> 03:22:42,890
Alright, let's get...

5119
03:22:42,890 --> 03:22:44,510
Let's see...

5120
03:22:44,510 --> 03:22:45,450
Uh...

5121
03:22:45,450 --> 03:22:46,190
We'll do...

5122
03:22:46,190 --> 03:22:47,110
Yeah, we'll do...

5123
03:22:48,190 --> 03:22:48,730
Skar...

5124
03:22:50,270 --> 03:22:51,350
Let's see...

5125
03:22:51,350 --> 03:22:52,330
K...

5126
03:22:53,010 --> 03:22:53,550
R...

5127
03:22:54,750 --> 03:22:55,290
Skar...

5128
03:22:55,290 --> 03:22:56,250
Wait, do I have...

5129
03:22:56,250 --> 03:22:56,810
Three...

5130
03:22:56,810 --> 03:22:57,170
G...

5131
03:22:57,170 --> 03:22:57,850
Okay, whoops.

5132
03:22:59,810 --> 03:23:00,530
G...

5133
03:23:00,530 --> 03:23:01,230
O...

5134
03:23:01,230 --> 03:23:01,470
O...

5135
03:23:01,470 --> 03:23:01,590
O...

5136
03:23:01,590 --> 03:23:01,710
N...

5137
03:23:01,710 --> 03:23:02,150
There you go!

5138
03:23:05,170 --> 03:23:05,890
Alright!

5139
03:23:06,330 --> 03:23:06,690
Yay!

5140
03:23:07,270 --> 03:23:07,870
Here you go!

5141
03:23:08,030 --> 03:23:08,830
As promised!

5142
03:23:09,610 --> 03:23:10,050
Yay!

5143
03:23:13,130 --> 03:23:14,630
I did it, guys!

5144
03:23:18,670 --> 03:23:19,190
Mario!

5145
03:23:19,190 --> 03:23:20,810
Okay, we only have two...

5146
03:23:20,810 --> 03:23:21,250
Two left!

5147
03:23:22,930 --> 03:23:24,950
Surely there's nobody up here, right?

5148
03:23:26,210 --> 03:23:26,950
Oh, nice!

5149
03:23:28,010 --> 03:23:29,470
Well, I didn't really happy with these!

5150
03:23:30,010 --> 03:23:31,130
Alright, let's go back.

5151
03:23:31,990 --> 03:23:33,330
Let's go back and heal.

5152
03:23:33,550 --> 03:23:34,610
We are a little...

5153
03:23:34,610 --> 03:23:35,370
We're a little...

5154
03:23:35,370 --> 03:23:37,070
We are a little low right now.

5155
03:23:39,290 --> 03:23:39,770
Yay!

5156
03:23:40,070 --> 03:23:40,770
We did it!

5157
03:23:40,770 --> 03:23:41,990
Mario!

5158
03:23:42,650 --> 03:23:45,190
I sense you have all five silver stars!

5159
03:23:45,590 --> 03:23:49,250
Don't feel jealous, but Luigi was able to tame them before you were!

5160
03:23:49,690 --> 03:23:53,130
If you defeat me slowly, you may be able to reach him in the Molten Kingdom!

5161
03:23:53,590 --> 03:23:55,450
Are you ready to challenge me?

5162
03:23:55,870 --> 03:23:57,750
Yes, I am, Rosalina!

5163
03:23:58,350 --> 03:23:59,770
Yes, I am!

5164
03:24:00,230 --> 03:24:02,390
Then I hope you're properly prepared!

5165
03:24:04,110 --> 03:24:04,750
Whoa!

5166
03:24:05,970 --> 03:24:09,070
You stand on the precipice of greatness!

5167
03:24:09,070 --> 03:24:11,130
I ask you to take it in!

5168
03:24:11,430 --> 03:24:14,850
But I also understand that the haste is of importance to your quest!

5169
03:24:15,310 --> 03:24:16,010
Let's begin!

5170
03:24:17,130 --> 03:24:18,750
We don't need a save, guys!

5171
03:24:19,190 --> 03:24:20,150
We're invincible!

5172
03:24:23,370 --> 03:24:24,730
Oh my god, Senza...

5173
03:24:24,730 --> 03:24:26,230
Oh, I forgot Rice is here!

5174
03:24:28,010 --> 03:24:28,450
Wait...

5175
03:24:28,450 --> 03:24:29,870
Wait, Rice, why are you here?

5176
03:24:31,230 --> 03:24:32,810
Oh, I swapped you out!

5177
03:24:32,970 --> 03:24:33,150
Whoops!

5178
03:24:34,950 --> 03:24:36,450
I was like, why are you here?

5179
03:24:39,150 --> 03:24:40,050
Oh, shit!

5180
03:24:42,910 --> 03:24:43,810
Oh, fuck!

5181
03:24:43,990 --> 03:24:44,650
Okay, that's fine!

5182
03:24:44,850 --> 03:24:45,290
That's fine!

5183
03:24:46,190 --> 03:24:46,950
That's fine!

5184
03:24:47,170 --> 03:24:48,150
I just gave her...

5185
03:24:48,150 --> 03:24:49,710
I just gave her a freebie, you know?

5186
03:24:50,090 --> 03:24:51,450
Just a little freebie!

5187
03:24:52,110 --> 03:24:52,930
Jesus Christ!

5188
03:24:53,270 --> 03:24:53,750
What?!

5189
03:24:53,750 --> 03:24:55,310
With 1 HP?!

5190
03:24:56,010 --> 03:24:56,850
Oh, no!

5191
03:24:57,650 --> 03:24:58,490
Oh, no!

5192
03:24:58,650 --> 03:24:59,110
I forgot!

5193
03:24:59,410 --> 03:25:01,150
Rosalina is a psychic...

5194
03:25:01,150 --> 03:25:02,850
Is a psychic user!

5195
03:25:03,650 --> 03:25:05,810
Does that mean I will have my pressure, Mario?

5196
03:25:08,590 --> 03:25:10,230
Oh, this is awkward!

5197
03:25:12,830 --> 03:25:14,150
What is Luba?

5198
03:25:16,610 --> 03:25:17,930
Oh, fuck!

5199
03:25:18,410 --> 03:25:19,130
That's Luba!

5200
03:25:21,210 --> 03:25:22,670
There's Luba!

5201
03:25:28,430 --> 03:25:30,410
There goes Luba!

5202
03:25:32,390 --> 03:25:34,050
Goodbye, Luba!

5203
03:25:36,310 --> 03:25:39,050
How the fuck did that Luba live over Luba?!

5204
03:25:42,430 --> 03:25:43,450
Bye, Luba!

5205
03:25:45,530 --> 03:25:46,570
Oh, sky attack!

5206
03:25:46,730 --> 03:25:47,850
Wait, that might be a good move!

5207
03:25:49,890 --> 03:25:51,170
Oh, search us out?

5208
03:25:51,410 --> 03:25:53,050
No, if it takes you two moves...

5209
03:25:53,590 --> 03:25:54,250
Fuck that!

5210
03:25:55,650 --> 03:25:56,490
Wait, actually...

5211
03:25:56,490 --> 03:25:57,450
Wait, is it two moves?

5212
03:25:57,990 --> 03:25:59,210
I can't tell...

5213
03:26:00,390 --> 03:26:01,170
Oh, yeah, yeah.

5214
03:26:01,230 --> 03:26:02,230
If it takes two moves...

5215
03:26:02,230 --> 03:26:02,370
Nah!

5216
03:26:07,200 --> 03:26:07,720
Alright.

5217
03:26:09,100 --> 03:26:11,040
He's a Luba, not a fighter.

5218
03:26:12,340 --> 03:26:13,300
Alright, sit.

5219
03:26:14,420 --> 03:26:14,740
Yay!

5220
03:26:18,280 --> 03:26:18,800
What?!

5221
03:26:19,520 --> 03:26:21,880
How are they living with 1 HP?!

5222
03:26:21,880 --> 03:26:24,200
There's no way you're bigger than Dad!

5223
03:26:24,600 --> 03:26:25,500
There's no way!

5224
03:26:35,680 --> 03:26:37,240
Oh, he has heavy defense?

5225
03:26:37,480 --> 03:26:38,420
Oh, okay.

5226
03:26:38,760 --> 03:26:40,440
I was gonna say, like, what the fuck?

5227
03:26:40,540 --> 03:26:41,540
How is he bigger?

5228
03:26:41,680 --> 03:26:42,200
Oh, shit.

5229
03:26:42,220 --> 03:26:42,980
He's faster, too.

5230
03:26:42,980 --> 03:26:43,480
I forgot.

5231
03:26:43,760 --> 03:26:44,600
He has...

5232
03:26:44,600 --> 03:26:45,380
He has legs!

5233
03:26:46,480 --> 03:26:47,780
I risked it.

5234
03:26:51,970 --> 03:26:53,310
I risked it.

5235
03:26:53,630 --> 03:26:54,310
It's fine.

5236
03:26:55,250 --> 03:26:55,710
Okay.

5237
03:26:57,090 --> 03:26:57,670
It's okay.

5238
03:27:01,210 --> 03:27:03,150
Wait, what's strong against psychic?

5239
03:27:03,430 --> 03:27:03,910
Bug, right?

5240
03:27:04,250 --> 03:27:04,830
Bug!

5241
03:27:05,090 --> 03:27:05,750
Sick bug!

5242
03:27:07,230 --> 03:27:08,750
It's time, sick bug!

5243
03:27:10,550 --> 03:27:11,310
It's time, sick bug!

5244
03:27:11,310 --> 03:27:12,470
It's your moment to shine!

5245
03:27:19,200 --> 03:27:20,120
Here we go.

5246
03:27:23,420 --> 03:27:24,500
Mr. Eye?

5247
03:27:24,780 --> 03:27:25,820
What's a Mr. Eye?

5248
03:27:27,680 --> 03:27:28,760
Oh, my God!

5249
03:27:28,980 --> 03:27:29,600
It's an eye!

5250
03:27:29,860 --> 03:27:30,140
Oh, my God!

5251
03:27:30,140 --> 03:27:30,360
It's an eye!

5252
03:27:30,360 --> 03:27:31,200
Stars, sky...

5253
03:27:31,200 --> 03:27:32,820
Oh, that's a Mr. Eye!

5254
03:27:34,820 --> 03:27:36,540
I was like, the fuck is that?

5255
03:27:39,820 --> 03:27:40,340
Oh...

5256
03:27:40,340 --> 03:27:41,520
I pricked it.

5257
03:27:41,980 --> 03:27:43,060
I pricked your eye.

5258
03:27:43,340 --> 03:27:43,680
Yoink!

5259
03:27:43,800 --> 03:27:44,520
Got your eye!

5260
03:27:46,500 --> 03:27:48,180
What enemy is that from?

5261
03:27:50,440 --> 03:27:51,440
Egg bomb!

5262
03:27:52,160 --> 03:27:53,100
My son!

5263
03:27:54,980 --> 03:27:56,600
Egg bomb.

5264
03:27:57,260 --> 03:27:58,900
Just like old times, son.

5265
03:27:59,620 --> 03:28:01,040
Just like old times.

5266
03:28:09,490 --> 03:28:10,130
Yeah!

5267
03:28:13,210 --> 03:28:15,790
Mario, you're a formidable battler.

5268
03:28:15,970 --> 03:28:17,490
And a wonderful person.

5269
03:28:17,930 --> 03:28:19,650
Please, take this power star.

5270
03:28:21,090 --> 03:28:21,410
Yay!

5271
03:28:22,010 --> 03:28:24,030
We got the comm observatory power star!

5272
03:28:24,290 --> 03:28:24,710
Yippee!

5273
03:28:25,350 --> 03:28:26,210
We did it!

5274
03:28:27,450 --> 03:28:29,050
And here, take this team.

5275
03:28:29,770 --> 03:28:31,450
It contains the moose cycle cut.

5276
03:28:32,330 --> 03:28:32,890
Yay!

5277
03:28:36,580 --> 03:28:38,360
Your seventh power star.

5278
03:28:38,740 --> 03:28:41,600
The last one you're left to collect is in the Molten Kingdom.

5279
03:28:42,260 --> 03:28:45,340
Your brother defeated me earlier and must be there now.

5280
03:28:45,820 --> 03:28:48,800
For you to catch up and beat him, you need to be quick.

5281
03:28:49,740 --> 03:28:54,680
I've prepared a method of sending you right to the entrance of Bowser's castle.

5282
03:28:54,900 --> 03:28:55,880
Wait, he has...

5283
03:28:55,880 --> 03:28:57,900
Oh no, Bowser Jr. has the last power star.

5284
03:28:58,440 --> 03:29:01,660
Simply, talk to my Luna and he'll send you on your way.

5285
03:29:02,320 --> 03:29:03,280
It isn't...

5286
03:29:03,280 --> 03:29:04,960
This isn't your only way there.

5287
03:29:05,400 --> 03:29:08,080
The warp zone will also have a warp pipe prepared for you.

5288
03:29:08,260 --> 03:29:10,900
So I only offer an expedited route.

5289
03:29:11,640 --> 03:29:14,240
My Luna still offers healing and supplies for your party.

5290
03:29:14,480 --> 03:29:16,460
So feel free to come back whenever you're ready.

5291
03:29:17,680 --> 03:29:19,140
Oh, well, it takes a while?

5292
03:29:19,380 --> 03:29:20,240
Alright, let's just heal.

5293
03:29:25,310 --> 03:29:25,790
Alright.

5294
03:29:26,150 --> 03:29:27,830
Where is the launch pipe?

5295
03:29:28,730 --> 03:29:30,410
Take me to the area.

5296
03:29:30,410 --> 03:29:33,250
I demand to be launched.

5297
03:29:36,070 --> 03:29:37,950
Alright, I'll save now.

5298
03:29:50,830 --> 03:29:51,650
What's this?

5299
03:29:52,630 --> 03:29:53,130
Oh!

5300
03:29:57,700 --> 03:29:58,740
Alright, this one.

5301
03:30:09,000 --> 03:30:10,420
There's Bowser's castle.

5302
03:30:11,280 --> 03:30:13,080
That's far enough, pal.

5303
03:30:14,240 --> 03:30:15,000
Oh shit.

5304
03:30:15,360 --> 03:30:17,460
That's quite far enough, Mario.

5305
03:30:18,440 --> 03:30:21,540
Seems my friends have been in contact with you.

5306
03:30:21,760 --> 03:30:22,700
You owe me.

5307
03:30:23,140 --> 03:30:28,520
Well, it's become quite apparent that you're not in the market for paying back your debts.

5308
03:30:29,260 --> 03:30:33,760
Given you wanted to, the interest you've accumulated is much too great for you.

5309
03:30:33,760 --> 03:30:36,800
So I'm afraid it's time for you to sleep with the Bargs.

5310
03:30:38,160 --> 03:30:38,720
Boys?

5311
03:30:39,500 --> 03:30:40,620
No, no, no.

5312
03:30:40,860 --> 03:30:41,360
Not the...

5313
03:30:41,360 --> 03:30:42,820
Nothing personal, pal.

5314
03:30:43,200 --> 03:30:43,480
No!

5315
03:30:43,680 --> 03:30:44,860
Not the Bargs!

5316
03:30:46,260 --> 03:30:47,120
That's alright.

5317
03:30:47,720 --> 03:30:48,240
Dad!

5318
03:30:48,540 --> 03:30:49,380
You got this!

5319
03:30:49,540 --> 03:30:50,640
I forgot to swap.

5320
03:30:51,100 --> 03:30:51,660
I for...

5321
03:30:54,200 --> 03:30:54,760
Alright.

5322
03:30:55,540 --> 03:30:57,240
This is a little awkward.

5323
03:30:58,520 --> 03:30:59,080
Um...

5324
03:30:59,080 --> 03:31:00,060
Oh wait, I can do this.

5325
03:31:00,200 --> 03:31:00,760
String sap.

5326
03:31:02,900 --> 03:31:05,660
This is still a little awkward, but...

5327
03:31:05,660 --> 03:31:07,880
I forgot to swap, you guys.

5328
03:31:11,540 --> 03:31:12,380
That's fine.

5329
03:31:12,820 --> 03:31:13,640
You should die, right?

5330
03:31:17,810 --> 03:31:19,770
Wait, why are you so slow, Rice?

5331
03:31:21,990 --> 03:31:24,010
You have the last move?

5332
03:31:27,750 --> 03:31:29,290
Wait, that's a stat?

5333
03:31:30,290 --> 03:31:31,710
Oh...

5334
03:31:49,350 --> 03:31:50,010
Goodbye.

5335
03:31:50,670 --> 03:31:51,590
Goodbye.

5336
03:31:56,690 --> 03:31:58,010
I

5337
03:32:06,190 --> 03:32:08,570
saw grass, okay, guys?

5338
03:32:08,570 --> 03:32:11,230
I saw grass and I thought...

5339
03:32:11,230 --> 03:32:12,310
This is it.

5340
03:32:13,370 --> 03:32:15,310
He won't disappoint me.

5341
03:32:23,380 --> 03:32:24,660
It's literally lava.

5342
03:32:25,760 --> 03:32:26,440
Oh no, stick bug.

5343
03:32:26,560 --> 03:32:26,720
No!

5344
03:32:30,180 --> 03:32:30,740
Yay!

5345
03:32:33,740 --> 03:32:35,220
Oh look, you leveled up, Bryce.

5346
03:32:35,300 --> 03:32:36,200
At least you leveled up.

5347
03:32:42,080 --> 03:32:42,680
Okay.

5348
03:32:43,180 --> 03:32:43,780
Okay.

5349
03:32:45,040 --> 03:32:45,820
It's fine.

5350
03:32:45,960 --> 03:32:46,540
I have storm throw.

5351
03:32:46,960 --> 03:32:48,140
It still works.

5352
03:32:51,040 --> 03:32:52,380
I'll keep punching fire.

5353
03:32:52,520 --> 03:32:53,480
I can punch fire!

5354
03:32:56,800 --> 03:32:57,400
Yeah!

5355
03:32:58,060 --> 03:32:59,040
Punch the fire!

5356
03:33:03,790 --> 03:33:05,470
Oh, you both wanted...

5357
03:33:05,470 --> 03:33:05,930
That's funny.

5358
03:33:06,070 --> 03:33:07,410
They both wanted to do...

5359
03:33:08,370 --> 03:33:08,970
Um...

5360
03:33:08,970 --> 03:33:09,870
The new sunny day.

5361
03:33:10,430 --> 03:33:10,530
Yay!

5362
03:33:10,690 --> 03:33:11,530
Free move for me!

5363
03:33:21,260 --> 03:33:21,920
That's okay.

5364
03:33:22,240 --> 03:33:23,400
Oh, it's just a little damage.

5365
03:33:23,580 --> 03:33:24,060
You're fine.

5366
03:33:24,720 --> 03:33:25,920
Punch the fire!

5367
03:33:26,980 --> 03:33:27,680
Punch it!

5368
03:33:29,740 --> 03:33:30,180
Yay!

5369
03:33:30,540 --> 03:33:31,760
Okay, that's not a lot of damage.

5370
03:33:31,880 --> 03:33:32,460
But that's okay.

5371
03:33:32,980 --> 03:33:33,700
It'll be fine.

5372
03:33:35,220 --> 03:33:36,320
I'm also fire.

5373
03:33:36,500 --> 03:33:37,440
I should be fine too.

5374
03:33:38,440 --> 03:33:39,680
Oh, that's a lot of damage.

5375
03:33:39,760 --> 03:33:40,480
What the fuck?

5376
03:33:40,500 --> 03:33:41,820
How was that so much damage?

5377
03:33:41,880 --> 03:33:42,960
I'm also fire!

5378
03:33:46,930 --> 03:33:47,710
What?

5379
03:33:52,940 --> 03:33:53,720
Okay.

5380
03:33:54,460 --> 03:33:55,240
Uh...

5381
03:33:56,000 --> 03:33:57,500
I'll just try Sucker Punch.

5382
03:33:58,820 --> 03:33:59,660
Fuck it.

5383
03:34:02,020 --> 03:34:03,460
Yeah, that's crazy.

5384
03:34:03,580 --> 03:34:05,180
That fire move is fucking insane.

5385
03:34:07,800 --> 03:34:09,560
Yeah, but I'm level 59.

5386
03:34:10,750 --> 03:34:12,460
That is so fucking buff.

5387
03:34:21,690 --> 03:34:22,770
That's right.

5388
03:34:24,530 --> 03:34:25,130
Cam.

5389
03:34:25,450 --> 03:34:25,890
Fucking.

5390
03:34:26,550 --> 03:34:28,210
Send me to the blogs.

5391
03:34:30,970 --> 03:34:31,570
Plus!

5392
03:34:31,990 --> 03:34:33,990
I'd leave your jobs for the failures.

5393
03:34:34,430 --> 03:34:35,430
We're sorry!

5394
03:34:36,190 --> 03:34:36,790
Imbecile!

5395
03:34:37,770 --> 03:34:38,350
Now, now.

5396
03:34:38,710 --> 03:34:40,110
Let's not be hasty, eh?

5397
03:34:40,230 --> 03:34:40,730
Why aren't you?

5398
03:34:41,630 --> 03:34:42,990
Cause they're all your debts forgiven!

5399
03:34:43,270 --> 03:34:43,870
Bye now!

5400
03:34:44,530 --> 03:34:44,830
Yay!

5401
03:34:45,270 --> 03:34:46,190
Look guys, see?

5402
03:34:46,490 --> 03:34:48,030
I beat the loan sharks!

5403
03:34:49,370 --> 03:34:49,930
See?

5404
03:34:50,270 --> 03:34:51,650
Party money's not bad!

5405
03:34:52,150 --> 03:34:53,470
Guys, look at that!

5406
03:34:54,090 --> 03:34:55,790
Buy all the money you want!

5407
03:34:56,430 --> 03:34:59,650
Luigi, don't worry about going through the whole castle.

5408
03:34:59,930 --> 03:35:02,070
Just follow us into the throne room.

5409
03:35:02,290 --> 03:35:03,670
We'll give you the power star.

5410
03:35:03,810 --> 03:35:06,490
And some need it alone time with Bowser.

5411
03:35:07,390 --> 03:35:08,990
Oh, that's okay, bro.

5412
03:35:09,290 --> 03:35:11,550
I should work for it like everyone else.

5413
03:35:12,090 --> 03:35:12,650
Awesome.

5414
03:35:12,950 --> 03:35:15,350
It's not really fun when I'm being dragged, right?

5415
03:35:18,230 --> 03:35:19,570
No, we insist.

5416
03:35:20,510 --> 03:35:23,990
We want you to get to the wish before Mario like everyone else does.

5417
03:35:24,670 --> 03:35:27,390
It doesn't matter to me if I get my wish.

5418
03:35:27,650 --> 03:35:30,130
I'm just playing to have fun with my bro.

5419
03:35:30,890 --> 03:35:31,170
Bro?

5420
03:35:32,430 --> 03:35:36,630
But Papa got mushroom pizza delivered for all of us.

5421
03:35:38,230 --> 03:35:39,810
Mushroom pizza, you say?

5422
03:35:40,670 --> 03:35:43,370
Of course, it's all waiting in the throne room.

5423
03:35:45,370 --> 03:35:45,890
Um...

5424
03:35:45,890 --> 03:35:48,110
Can we actually get mushroom pizza?

5425
03:35:48,950 --> 03:35:51,570
Let me pull out the royal credit card.

5426
03:35:52,110 --> 03:35:54,010
It's a business expense, guys.

5427
03:35:54,930 --> 03:35:56,270
Zechra, thank you for the super chat.

5428
03:35:56,390 --> 03:35:56,590
Thank you.

5429
03:35:56,730 --> 03:35:57,090
Thank you.

5430
03:35:57,170 --> 03:35:59,590
I just found out X-Naut has the scrappy ability.

5431
03:35:59,830 --> 03:36:01,490
I can throw hands with Mint.

5432
03:36:02,270 --> 03:36:03,490
Mario, wait up!

5433
03:36:04,490 --> 03:36:07,770
It looks like Luigi has been locked inside the throne room with Bowser.

5434
03:36:07,950 --> 03:36:09,490
Bowser Jr. and Kamek.

5435
03:36:10,130 --> 03:36:12,290
It's a sturdy door with a sturdy lock on it.

5436
03:36:12,470 --> 03:36:16,810
So you need to make your way through the whole castle and find that Bowser key.

5437
03:36:17,830 --> 03:36:18,670
All right, nice.

5438
03:36:18,830 --> 03:36:19,050
All right.

5439
03:36:20,590 --> 03:36:21,070
What's that?

5440
03:36:21,250 --> 03:36:22,130
Why am I here?

5441
03:36:22,650 --> 03:36:26,090
Of course, I want to give you something to help you get through the castle.

5442
03:36:26,650 --> 03:36:28,250
Oh, I got the gad pill.

5443
03:36:28,510 --> 03:36:29,010
What's that?

5444
03:36:29,790 --> 03:36:32,770
That right there is my brand new gad pill.

5445
03:36:32,970 --> 03:36:37,610
To scare away any Bowser pesky captures from attacking you while you're walking around.

5446
03:36:37,610 --> 03:36:40,130
Oh, and don't worry about how it works.

5447
03:36:40,310 --> 03:36:42,730
The smell is showing me too noticeable to the wear.

5448
03:36:43,470 --> 03:36:46,510
Now then, I'm heading back to my lab.

5449
03:36:46,890 --> 03:36:49,410
Okay, we can catch some stuff and then we'll use it.

5450
03:36:49,690 --> 03:36:50,090
All right.

5451
03:36:52,110 --> 03:36:55,030
That's a good time to stop, guys.

5452
03:36:55,470 --> 03:36:57,510
Oh, because I have a lot of stuff to do today.

5453
03:36:57,670 --> 03:36:59,750
Anyway, a lot of stuff.

5454
03:37:03,010 --> 03:37:05,370
But it's great to be back, everyone.

5455
03:37:05,370 --> 03:37:06,030
Oh, yeah.

5456
03:37:06,310 --> 03:37:08,530
Before we go, it's new emotes time.

5457
03:37:09,330 --> 03:37:09,590
Guys.

5458
03:37:09,870 --> 03:37:10,110
All right.

5459
03:37:10,190 --> 03:37:10,730
Let me...

5460
03:37:11,510 --> 03:37:13,710
Let me grab the emotes real quick.

5461
03:37:13,810 --> 03:37:15,130
We'll have to download it.

5462
03:37:15,690 --> 03:37:16,130
All right.

5463
03:37:16,270 --> 03:37:22,130
So for those who don't know, we have two new emotes that we are going to be...

5464
03:37:23,110 --> 03:37:24,770
We're going to be uploading today.

5465
03:37:25,090 --> 03:37:27,070
Let me sort this out.

5466
03:37:27,510 --> 03:37:30,390
So, two new emotes that we have is...

5467
03:37:32,910 --> 03:37:34,550
I'm trying to grab it right now.

5468
03:37:35,490 --> 03:37:39,030
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

5469
03:37:39,030 --> 03:37:41,650
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

5470
03:37:41,910 --> 03:37:43,690
So here are two new emotes.

5471
03:37:45,290 --> 03:37:47,010
We have this one.

5472
03:37:47,010 --> 03:37:48,210
I'm happy for you.

5473
03:37:49,570 --> 03:37:52,190
Because I know you guys love using that one.

5474
03:37:52,410 --> 03:37:54,730
And we have the side eye.

5475
03:37:54,730 --> 03:37:57,910
So these are two new emotes that we're uploading.

5476
03:37:58,170 --> 03:38:01,210
And we are going to be getting rid of...

5477
03:38:02,330 --> 03:38:03,910
From popular vote.

5478
03:38:04,070 --> 03:38:05,590
From your fellow dragoons.

5479
03:38:05,710 --> 03:38:08,970
These are the two emotes that we will be getting rid of.

5480
03:38:09,110 --> 03:38:10,510
So say goodbye to them.

5481
03:38:10,850 --> 03:38:11,770
Say goodbye.

5482
03:38:11,870 --> 03:38:14,310
They have lived a good life.

5483
03:38:14,870 --> 03:38:16,650
But they shall be replaced.

5484
03:38:17,290 --> 03:38:17,890
Don't worry.

5485
03:38:18,050 --> 03:38:18,430
They will...

5486
03:38:18,430 --> 03:38:19,370
They'll still have...

5487
03:38:19,370 --> 03:38:20,930
They'll still be alive on Twitch.

5488
03:38:21,450 --> 03:38:21,930
So...

5489
03:38:21,930 --> 03:38:23,510
I have to do that too.

5490
03:38:23,550 --> 03:38:24,530
I need to remember to...

5491
03:38:25,790 --> 03:38:27,530
I need to remember to like...

5492
03:38:28,450 --> 03:38:30,750
To like upload the Twitch emotes as well.

5493
03:38:31,130 --> 03:38:31,610
But...

5494
03:38:32,170 --> 03:38:32,650
Uh...

5495
03:38:32,650 --> 03:38:33,490
Oh, what's the word?

5496
03:38:33,710 --> 03:38:34,590
What's the word?

5497
03:38:34,770 --> 03:38:35,270
To update it.

5498
03:38:35,330 --> 03:38:36,710
Yeah, to update my Twitch emotes.

5499
03:38:36,770 --> 03:38:38,230
Because that's something I gotta do.

5500
03:38:38,490 --> 03:38:38,910
But anyway.

5501
03:38:39,230 --> 03:38:39,410
Alright.

5502
03:38:39,490 --> 03:38:40,370
Where are these two?

5503
03:38:40,990 --> 03:38:42,410
Let me get rid of them.

5504
03:38:42,630 --> 03:38:42,910
Alright.

5505
03:38:45,090 --> 03:38:45,570
Happy...

5506
03:38:46,730 --> 03:38:47,210
Or...

5507
03:38:48,190 --> 03:38:49,150
So happy.

5508
03:38:52,630 --> 03:38:53,110
Alright.

5509
03:38:53,310 --> 03:38:53,970
Say goodbye!

5510
03:38:55,170 --> 03:38:57,610
Say goodbye to these emotes!

5511
03:38:59,130 --> 03:39:00,090
And then...

5512
03:39:00,090 --> 03:39:00,910
Where's the other one?

5513
03:39:01,610 --> 03:39:02,210
My emotes.

5514
03:39:02,430 --> 03:39:02,490
But wait.

5515
03:39:02,570 --> 03:39:03,390
Thank you to the super chat.

5516
03:39:03,510 --> 03:39:03,750
Thank you.

5517
03:39:03,870 --> 03:39:04,350
Thank you.

5518
03:39:04,550 --> 03:39:05,890
And then this one will be...

5519
03:39:05,890 --> 03:39:06,030
Okay.

5520
03:39:06,070 --> 03:39:07,210
I'm gonna rename this...

5521
03:39:07,210 --> 03:39:07,990
To Tomato.

5522
03:39:08,750 --> 03:39:10,430
And then this one will be...

5523
03:39:11,170 --> 03:39:11,570
SideEye.

5524
03:39:14,510 --> 03:39:14,910
Alright.

5525
03:39:14,930 --> 03:39:15,790
Are you guys ready?

5526
03:39:18,950 --> 03:39:19,350
Wait.

5527
03:39:19,570 --> 03:39:20,090
Give me a sec.

5528
03:39:20,150 --> 03:39:20,710
I'm not ready.

5529
03:39:23,370 --> 03:39:23,770
Sorry.

5530
03:39:23,770 --> 03:39:24,770
I wasn't ready.

5531
03:39:25,390 --> 03:39:25,710
Alright.

5532
03:39:28,470 --> 03:39:29,270
In three...

5533
03:39:30,530 --> 03:39:30,930
Two...

5534
03:39:30,930 --> 03:39:31,850
One.

5535
03:39:32,810 --> 03:39:32,850
One.

5536
03:39:36,730 --> 03:39:38,230
And they shall be gone.

5537
03:39:38,830 --> 03:39:38,970
Oh.

5538
03:39:39,550 --> 03:39:40,810
They're gone now.

5539
03:39:45,000 --> 03:39:46,240
They're gone.

5540
03:39:46,780 --> 03:39:47,340
They're gone.

5541
03:39:47,340 --> 03:39:47,360
They're gone.

5542
03:39:47,360 --> 03:39:48,620
They're now just squares.

5543
03:39:49,420 --> 03:39:50,780
They're gone forever.

5544
03:39:50,780 --> 03:39:51,180
Never.

5545
03:39:52,300 --> 03:39:53,060
They...

5546
03:39:56,940 --> 03:39:59,000
But now you get...

5547
03:39:59,780 --> 03:40:02,020
Now you get so happy.

5548
03:40:02,220 --> 03:40:03,400
Happy for you.

5549
03:40:03,880 --> 03:40:04,780
And sideEye.

5550
03:40:05,940 --> 03:40:07,540
You're in two new emotes.

5551
03:40:07,680 --> 03:40:10,780
We have voted two emotes off the island.

5552
03:40:12,020 --> 03:40:12,460
Well...

5553
03:40:12,460 --> 03:40:13,940
Now you can welcome your new...

5554
03:40:14,340 --> 03:40:15,600
Your new siblings.

5555
03:40:16,020 --> 03:40:16,820
Your new friends.

5556
03:40:17,620 --> 03:40:18,620
Your new friends.

5557
03:40:19,380 --> 03:40:20,180
Where's the sideEye?

5558
03:40:20,220 --> 03:40:20,320
Oh.

5559
03:40:20,360 --> 03:40:20,960
You just gotta refresh.

5560
03:40:21,680 --> 03:40:22,120
Anyway.

5561
03:40:22,300 --> 03:40:23,680
You guys gotta refresh the chat.

5562
03:40:23,880 --> 03:40:24,880
And you should see it.

5563
03:40:25,000 --> 03:40:25,480
Hey guys.

5564
03:40:26,360 --> 03:40:27,540
I'm gonna call it here.

5565
03:40:27,980 --> 03:40:29,340
Thank you everybody for watching.

5566
03:40:29,340 --> 03:40:30,960
I have a very busy day today.

5567
03:40:31,020 --> 03:40:33,380
Since I have a lot of work obligations from...

5568
03:40:34,440 --> 03:40:34,840
Uh...

5569
03:40:34,840 --> 03:40:36,360
That were super backed up.

5570
03:40:36,420 --> 03:40:37,220
So I gotta work on that.

5571
03:40:37,460 --> 03:40:38,940
But a great time stream for you guys.

5572
03:40:39,100 --> 03:40:39,760
As always.

5573
03:40:40,260 --> 03:40:40,580
Uh...

5574
03:40:40,580 --> 03:40:41,900
Dad's gonna be back in like...

5575
03:40:41,900 --> 03:40:43,160
Maybe like 20 or 30 minutes.

5576
03:40:43,300 --> 03:40:44,120
So I gotta like...

5577
03:40:44,120 --> 03:40:44,980
Take care of dad too.

5578
03:40:45,140 --> 03:40:45,880
When he gets here.

5579
03:40:46,060 --> 03:40:46,600
Hey guys.

5580
03:40:46,600 --> 03:40:47,760
I hope you guys have a fun time.

5581
03:40:47,880 --> 03:40:48,980
Another Super Mario mod.

5582
03:40:49,300 --> 03:40:51,300
Does anyone know how many more parts I have left?

5583
03:40:51,360 --> 03:40:52,560
For Super Mario mod?

5584
03:40:52,880 --> 03:40:54,800
Maybe I can finish it in two more streams guys.

5585
03:40:55,520 --> 03:40:56,360
Do you think that's possible?

5586
03:40:56,920 --> 03:40:58,700
Cause I might try to finish it next week.

5587
03:40:58,920 --> 03:41:00,000
I'll do two parts next week.

5588
03:41:00,360 --> 03:41:00,840
Anyway guys.

5589
03:41:01,000 --> 03:41:02,140
As always everybody.

5590
03:41:02,480 --> 03:41:03,380
Stay hydrated.

5591
03:41:03,700 --> 03:41:04,300
Posture check.

5592
03:41:04,560 --> 03:41:05,000
Get up.

5593
03:41:05,120 --> 03:41:05,680
And move around.

5594
03:41:05,840 --> 03:41:06,800
To get that blood flowing.

5595
03:41:06,960 --> 03:41:07,380
And if you.

5596
03:41:07,500 --> 03:41:08,200
Except for me.

5597
03:41:08,420 --> 03:41:09,200
Head to bed.

5598
03:41:09,380 --> 03:41:09,820
Cause...

5599
03:41:09,820 --> 03:41:10,920
You deserve it.

5600
03:41:11,100 --> 03:41:12,580
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

5601
03:41:13,420 --> 03:41:14,300
Bye guys.

5602
03:41:14,980 --> 03:41:15,420
Bye.
