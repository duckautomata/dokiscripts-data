1
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,960
Hey, give me a sec.

2
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,280
I'm not alive right now.

3
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:03,400
Jokey Bird needs 1-2 hours to be a person again.

4
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:12,060
I woke up 15 minutes ago, so I'm not real at the moment.

5
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,280
I'm not real.

6
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,040
Oh my god.

7
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,220
I slept, I don't know, I think I slept too much.

8
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,280
I was in a dream within a dream.

9
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,240
And that was like the worst type of dreams to have.

10
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,040
Because like, um, okay, it was a, it was a fucking freaky movie.

11
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,720
Like, it was a fucking scary movie dream too.

12
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:43,340
Um, because it was like, I basically like, um, it was like a horror film.

13
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:54,960
So like my dream within a dream, um, was basically I woke up, and then my door had this like little, like little, like, entraption on the door.

14
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,060
Where it was closing by itself.

15
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,420
And was trying to lock me in, and I was like freaking out about it.

16
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,680
And I was like, what the fuck?

17
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,500
Like, why am I being locked in?

18
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,260
Who's here?

19
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,160
And then I forced open the door.

20
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,880
Yeah, I got in a nightmare.

21
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,980
And then I heard some noises in the bathroom.

22
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,320
And I tried to peek in.

23
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:22,980
And then like, um, and then there was some random guy in my bathroom.

24
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,580
And was like, don't come in.

25
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,120
And I was like, what the fuck?

26
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,120
I was like, who are you?

27
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,140
And then I looked, and then I forced myself in.

28
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:37,280
And then I just see this bloody guy in my bathroom, in the bathtub.

29
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,500
And I was like freaking out.

30
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,140
And I was like, holy fuck, what the fuck?

31
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,420
And then I woke up.

32
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,360
But I wasn't fully awake yet.

33
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,820
Like, I wasn't, I was still in my dream.

34
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:54,340
Like, I woke up, but I was in, why are you trying to enter?

35
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,380
Because I was in a horror film, and people in horror films don't make fucking right decisions.

36
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,680
Like, I had to play my part.

37
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,180
I...

38
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:06,820
Anyways.

39
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,640
And then, um, and I woke up.

40
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,400
We're in.

41
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,840
I'm so self-aware.

42
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,360
I don't break meta.

43
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,560
Anyway, so, um.

44
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,260
So, I woke up, I was still in my dream.

45
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,600
And then the craziest part was that...

46
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,060
First thing I do was open Discord in my dream.

47
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,520
I was like, oh my god, I had a crazy dream.

48
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,260
Like, I don't know, I messaged somebody.

49
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,660
I don't remember who I messaged.

50
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,560
I was like, oh my god, I had the craziest dream.

51
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:57,980
Like, there was a fucking man in my bathtub with blood all over him.

52
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,180
I think he was like, murdered somebody?

53
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,140
And then, like, I don't remember the conversation.

54
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,900
I was just, like, being like...

55
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,600
And then the person was like, oh, you mean that...

56
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,600
Wait, we saw...

57
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,300
Like, you mean, like, when we were, like...

58
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,520
When, like, we met up and saw, like, that creepy man?

59
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,020
And, like, that was following us around?

60
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,880
And I was like, we met up?

61
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,140
I was like, what?

62
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,080
Where did I see her?

63
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,900
I'm so confused.

64
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,680
I was like, what?

65
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,490
Where did I...

66
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,040
And then, like...

67
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,100
And then I was so confused.

68
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:41,200
I was like, I don't remember ever meeting you.

69
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,270
And then we saw...

70
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,140
We saw somebody following us.

71
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,180
And then I had a dream flashback.

72
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,480
I...

73
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,260
Of, like, for some reason, I had...

74
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:06,220
A dream flashback where it showed me and her and the guy following us.

75
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,410
And I was like, what the...

76
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,280
I was like, what the fu...

77
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,640
My dream punch scene of this guy.

78
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,520
And then I was like, oh my god, you're right.

79
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,040
And then I was like, oh my god, you're right.

80
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,600
He was following us.

81
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:33,500
Like...

82
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,340
You be dreaming of a time movie.

83
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,400
Apparently so.

84
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,880
And then, I don't know.

85
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,860
And then I woke up.

86
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,420
And then I had a nut different dream.

87
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,220
And then, I don't know.

88
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,260
I don't remember after that.

89
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,140
That was, like, the craziest shit.

90
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,760
Cause I, like, it was so vivid.

91
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,480
Like, I remember that part.

92
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,060
But I don't remember the other dreams I had last night.

93
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,800
I slept a long time.

94
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,360
I went to bed early.

95
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,540
And I went to bed early.

96
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,700
And then I woke up literally 15 minutes ago.

97
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,100
But yes, that was my dream today.

98
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,240
There's not much to update you guys about today.

99
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,460
Because, yes, last night and today was really boring.

100
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,920
Cause all I did was mostly sleep after the stream.

101
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,200
So, I mean, I did work stuff.

102
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,480
And then I went to bed.

103
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,140
How's Doki Amber Doge?

104
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,060
He's also sleeping right now.

105
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,560
But yeah, today is another part.

106
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,840
I don't know if I'm doing a super long...

107
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,540
It depends on how my voice is feeling throughout the day.

108
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,240
So, like, I don't know if it's going to be a super long Dynasty Warriors stream.

109
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,660
Or if my voice is going to give up, like, a bit after.

110
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,440
So, I'm going to stop at a point where I feel like I need to rest my voice.

111
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,980
So, today is another part of Dynasty Warriors.

112
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,500
I have no idea how much more we have.

113
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:04,880
I asked my thumbnail maker to make, like, three Dynasty Warriors thumbnails in advance every time.

114
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,400
So, like, cause I feel like it's going to be a lot.

115
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,520
I feel like three months is going to pass.

116
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,660
And then you're going to tune into the channel and you'll be like, Is she still streaming Dynasty Warriors?

117
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,560
Yes, we are not done yet.

118
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,780
We're not done yet, guys.

119
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,160
Alright, so let's get to it.

120
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,880
Cause I'm doing everything too.

121
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,800
I don't know, I've been enjoying it a lot.

122
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,980
I know it's not, like, the most popular playthrough.

123
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,420
But who the fuck cares?

124
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,640
I like it.

125
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,440
I get one, okay?

126
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:55,420
One a year where I play a game that I just enjoy.

127
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,400
I'm broke.

128
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:01,340
Oh, husband, you spent all your money on Lu Bu.

129
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,440
Now we're homeless.

130
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,580
Oh, why did nobody stop me?

131
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,960
Alright, I guess we'll do the Sun Jian one.

132
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:21,060
I don't even remember what we were at, at this point.

133
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:24,860
Alright.

134
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,060
I still haven't recovered financially.

135
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,340
No, I haven't.

136
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,420
No, this is Lu Bei.

137
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,760
Lu Bei, I'll do your shit later.

138
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,440
I need to do the Sun Jian one.

139
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,460
Oh, he's so cool.

140
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,380
He's so fucking cool.

141
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,580
Also, I realized I didn't even adjust my sound.

142
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:46,660
I...

143
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,780
I saved it.

144
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,580
Give me a sec.

145
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,240
Let me find it real quick.

146
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,820
I just realized that.

147
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,860
I was like, wait a minute.

148
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,020
That...

149
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,800
Why does it seem, like, really loud?

150
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,520
Okay.

151
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,160
Dynasty Warrior.

152
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,660
I always save the settings.

153
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,340
Oh, okay.

154
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,180
It's not that bad.

155
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,000
Alright, nice.

156
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:10,860
It's not loud.

157
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,080
It was actually quiet.

158
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:12,760
Okay.

159
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,760
It's usually here, I believe.

160
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:19,940
Alright, nice.

161
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:20,880
Alright, nice.

162
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,160
We were just okay.

163
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,200
Okay.

164
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,440
Now I have to look at the map.

165
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,120
Where do I go?

166
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,620
Oh, it's right here.

167
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,760
Is that Sun Jian?

168
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,060
Are you Sun Jian?

169
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,340
Oh, there you are.

170
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,760
Oh my god, you're right next to us.

171
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,120
That is so convenient.

172
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,300
Thank you.

173
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:42,980
Alright.

174
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:43,880
Oh my god.

175
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,620
We're going straight into without romancing any generals today?

176
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,800
Yes, guys.

177
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,020
Today is our lucky day because I already...

178
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,560
I already talked to everybody before the last...

179
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,380
Before the last playthrough ended.

180
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,140
Zhou Yu?

181
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,980
Are you coming to this battle this time?

182
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,040
You're...

183
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,320
The prince's very good...

184
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,820
Very, very, very, very good friend.

185
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,440
I need to get a fucking cough drop before I continue.

186
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,120
You must ensure the safety of both the present and future of the Sun clan.

187
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,100
There's no need to be dramatic.

188
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,260
My father and I...

189
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,540
I like how everyone's like, he's still alive?

190
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,380
I know.

191
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,300
I've never played a game where he's lived this long before.

192
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,480
Unless you're playing as Sun Jian and you defy his death.

193
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,440
My father and I are both capable of taking care of ourselves.

194
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,800
Oh, that is heavy foreshadowing right there.

195
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,380
Besides, you're the one making the decisions here, Zhou Yu.

196
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,880
You're worth more than...

197
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,560
Wow!

198
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,160
Sun Jian!

199
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,320
You're worth more than either of us.

200
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:17,920
He says...

201
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,920
In front of his fucking father?

202
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,940
Well, I suppose we are both important in our own...

203
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,820
Like, his father is right there.

204
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,680
Let us be careful not to put ourselves at risk.

205
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,800
Now, please allow me to outline our plan to assault the castle.

206
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,080
We'll have three main points of attack.

207
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,280
Lord Hong Dan from the front, Lord Chen Pu from the east, and Sun Tze from the west.

208
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,440
Lord Hong Dan will attack the base, drawing the enemy's attention.

209
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,220
He'll then start building a ramp to break through the castle.

210
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,420
He's still around?

211
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,580
Hong Dan?

212
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:01,300
Meanwhile, Chen Pu will advance from the east, capture the base there, and ring fire arrows on the castle.

213
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,540
This will silence the Confuser Mundo inside.

214
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:09,600
Once the fire is visible to them, Sun Tze's force will storm from the west, taking the castle.

215
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,520
An excellent plan, Zhou Yu.

216
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,740
I look forward to seeing you put it into action.

217
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:16,960
Thank you, sir.

218
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,700
Not joking, you may act at your discretion.

219
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,720
But you can take care of Zhou Yu for us as well.

220
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,600
I'm sure he'll find commanding easier with your help.

221
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,420
Oh, I can get Zhou Yu as my companion?

222
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,620
Oh my god, I bet he's very jealous right now.

223
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,720
Oh man.

224
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,580
You may know your roles to fulfill them as best as you can now.

225
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,280
To battle!

226
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,960
Alright, let's see.

227
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,780
Is there anything I need to do?

228
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,520
Alright, Yuan Shao, perform...

229
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,420
Perform...

230
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:05,900
Is there anyone that I want to, like, do well with?

231
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,440
What the fuck?

232
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,320
No.

233
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,460
No.

234
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,320
If I have to, I'll pay for it.

235
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,980
I am not doing that.

236
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,380
I am absolutely not doing that.

237
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,540
Okay, gauntlets, okay.

238
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,740
They want me to use gauntlets.

239
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,700
Okay, battle arts, battle arts.

240
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,440
Alright, I just need to use battle arts.

241
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:35,860
Okay.

242
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,620
Alright, nice.

243
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,640
Okay, let me grab...

244
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,740
Oh, I cannot change it.

245
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,200
Okay, now I can change, right?

246
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,880
I cannot change it.

247
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,720
Okay, now I can change.

248
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,420
Where the fuck is my gauntlets?

249
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,300
Okay, there we go.

250
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,040
Let's go.

251
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,420
Alright, get over here.

252
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,620
Wait, are you bad people?

253
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,120
You are.

254
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,160
I couldn't tell.

255
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:01,940
Oh, shit.

256
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,480
Oh my god, I am not used to...

257
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,280
I am not used to using the fucking fists right now.

258
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,280
It's okay.

259
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,860
These guys don't have names, so they're gonna be really easy to kill.

260
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,700
That's right.

261
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,300
I'm gonna fist you!

262
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,460
I'm gonna fist all of you!

263
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,180
That's right!

264
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:24,920
Easy.

265
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,580
Sorry, I didn't hear what he said.

266
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,340
Alright, let's go.

267
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,400
Wait, did I actually do it correctly?

268
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:35,880
I can't tell.

269
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,480
I can't tell sometimes.

270
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,240
Okay, I did.

271
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,340
Okay, good.

272
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,320
Oh my god, we're just 60?

273
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,580
Oh, shit, nice.

274
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,040
Let's go.

275
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,420
I don't think I'm supposed to fight them.

276
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,240
I should walk back.

277
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,900
Oh, I...

278
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,600
Oh, oh, I...

279
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,260
Oh, I fucked up.

280
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,220
I don't think I'm supposed to fight them.

281
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,500
Okay, okay, he went back.

282
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,160
Okay, that's good.

283
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,300
That's good, that's good.

284
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,200
They reset themselves.

285
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,780
Okay, that's good, guys.

286
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,040
They reset themselves, guys.

287
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,640
I didn't fuck it up.

288
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,500
I didn't fuck it up for everybody.

289
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,040
Okay.

290
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:27,780
Nice.

291
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,040
Where are you?

292
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,800
Where did he go?

293
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,140
Okay.

294
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,140
Guys, we did it, guys.

295
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:40,860
I might have accidentally started the fight, but we did it.

296
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,220
Okay, now what do we do?

297
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,620
Zhou Yu, what's the plan?

298
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,740
Wait, again?

299
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,300
Oh shit, there's more?

300
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,220
How many more castles do I have to take?

301
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,780
Yeah, where is it?

302
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,000
Zhou Yu, where the fuck is the signal?

303
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,160
Zhou Yu, I did everything I told you!

304
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,520
Where the fuck is the signal?

305
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,520
Are we not?

306
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,480
Oh my god, Zhou Yu!

307
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,860
Wait, did I accidentally use my power-up?

308
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:26,840
Oh shit, okay.

309
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,820
That was not what I wanted to do, but that's alright.

310
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,660
At least I can still beat him up.

311
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,240
Get over here.

312
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,560
Get over here.

313
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,820
That's fucking right.

314
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,600
I cannot counter with this one.

315
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,840
I don't know how to counter.

316
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,340
Okay.

317
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:45,920
Alright, dragons!

318
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,060
Do your thing!

319
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,760
Go do your thing, dragons!

320
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,780
I don't think you did anything, but that's okay.

321
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,840
Okay, nice.

322
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,660
Oh my god, nice!

323
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,060
I've actually countered with my fists.

324
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,200
Oh my god, I fucking did it.

325
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,000
That's right.

326
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,820
I'm here to end your entire family line.

327
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,440
Oh my god, where did you come from?

328
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,620
Okay, that's fine.

329
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,880
I can also end your family line too.

330
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,620
That's fine.

331
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,860
It's not exclusive to everybody.

332
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,280
I'll give it out for free.

333
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,580
You don't need to thank me.

334
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,900
And then I can take your wife too.

335
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,840
She will be a widow anyway.

336
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,020
No, I keep accidentally using my power-up!

337
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,980
We did our best.

338
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,800
Maybe not good enough.

339
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,320
Okay, nice.

340
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,200
Get out of here.

341
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,520
Yay, I got a base now.

342
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,100
Okay.

343
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,800
Okay, now I got the fire arrows.

344
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,680
I thought he said like take one base.

345
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,640
When did it become like three?

346
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,780
Oh my god, who died?

347
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,380
Oh, it's her.

348
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,140
Okay, that's fine.

349
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,160
That's fine.

350
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,060
We have...

351
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,580
Sun Jian has a lot of children.

352
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,800
So I'm okay with that.

353
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,660
Although they do keep dying.

354
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,640
So like...

355
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,720
That is a huge issue though.

356
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:32,400
The only issue is that his kids do keep dying.

357
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,180
So like I don't know what to do about that.

358
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,780
But don't worry.

359
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,880
He has a lot of concubines.

360
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,540
I believe in him.

361
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:47,640
Jesus Christ, how many generals do you have?

362
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,020
I'm still killing them?

363
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,540
How am I still killing generals?

364
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,140
Jesus!

365
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,040
Oh yeah, Zhou Yu has done well.

366
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,600
He only...

367
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,540
Oh my god, I fucking kicked him off of high ground and I can't jump.

368
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,420
That's the worst part.

369
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:19,840
Okay.

370
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:22,760
That's fine.

371
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,600
We got him though.

372
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,000
Get out of here.

373
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,680
Get...

374
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,860
Oh okay, she's dead.

375
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,200
Whoops.

376
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,180
Whoops.

377
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,000
Okay.

378
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,480
Your daughter might not be alive anymore.

379
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,900
But like it's not my fault.

380
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,120
I swear to god.

381
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,920
I swear to god.

382
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:40,880
She just wasn't...

383
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,580
I think maybe stop sending child soldiers?

384
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:44,940
Like...

385
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:52,940
I think if you stop sending child soldiers into the battle field, then maybe like...

386
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,220
You know.

387
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,660
Maybe they won't have died?

388
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,180
I don't know.

389
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,280
Okay, nice.

390
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,580
Wait, what is this?

391
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,320
Oh, it's a unique attack.

392
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,580
Oh, it's the extreme Musou attack.

393
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,740
Okay, we don't need to do that.

394
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,640
Okay, we gotta help the people down there.

395
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,180
I'm just saying.

396
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,360
I'm just saying.

397
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:30,800
If they stop sending children generals to the battle field, maybe things won't be that bad.

398
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,080
I don't know.

399
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,780
Okay, let's just help him.

400
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,380
Oh my god, he didn't even need help anyway.

401
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,260
Rest in peace, daughter.

402
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,120
Skill issue, obviously.

403
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,380
Exactly, that's what I'm saying!

404
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,240
Alright, Dragoon, are you okay if there's a general in front of you guys?

405
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,160
Well...

406
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,380
The Dragoons are like, wait a minute.

407
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,760
Why are you putting us in the middle of a fight?

408
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,600
And you guys all get like fucking shot at.

409
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,300
Sorry.

410
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,260
Sorry about that.

411
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,080
It was an accident, Dragoons.

412
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:08,560
I swear.

413
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,280
Ew.

414
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,080
You got the job done though.

415
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,780
I appreciate it, guys.

416
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,340
Nice.

417
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,020
Oh my god, wait.

418
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,940
He also had hands.

419
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,760
Are they better hands?

420
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,880
Oh no, they are not as good.

421
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:25,780
Wait, what do I...

422
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,100
Oh wait, no.

423
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:26,880
They're actually better.

424
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:27,760
Wait, okay.

425
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,100
But am I done with this?

426
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,900
No, I am not done.

427
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:32,900
I am...

428
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:33,120
What?

429
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:33,700
Okay.

430
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,340
I still need...

431
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,720
Okay, I need to do battle arts.

432
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,060
Okay.

433
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,000
That's fine.

434
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,300
That's fine.

435
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:45,480
Wait, who?

436
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,480
Oh my god, you also need help?

437
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,520
Please!

438
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,880
There's so many Generals!

439
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,780
Can't help you all!

440
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,880
Oh my god.

441
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,100
Oh my god.

442
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:01,980
It said...

443
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,780
Okay, destroy this.

444
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,040
I don't know what it is.

445
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,100
Destroy it.

446
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,100
Okay, we gotta make sure Sun Jian doesn't fucking die though.

447
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,620
Oh, he's so healthy.

448
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,340
Oh, he's fine.

449
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:17,100
Oh no, I have to reconstruct it?!

450
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,800
Okay, this is a little awkward.

451
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,360
Okay, Chen Po, you might have to die too.

452
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,220
War is about sacrifices.

453
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,420
As long as, like, you know...

454
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,170
Sun Tze and...

455
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,480
Oh my god.

456
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,260
I'm sorry!

457
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,060
We're taking so long!

458
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,080
Okay, goodbye Chen Po.

459
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,340
Alright, so...

460
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,720
Remember when the strategy was supposed to be like...

461
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,280
Jesus Christ!

462
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,360
Remember when Zhou Yu's strategy was like...

463
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,300
We all take, like, a specific area and then we do a pincer attack?

464
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,760
We do a three-way pincer attack?

465
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:03,000
Well, it's just gonna be a two-way pincer attack now.

466
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,480
I hope that doesn't change the strategy too much.

467
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,300
I hope...

468
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,580
Yeah, it's gonna be a two...

469
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,640
Remember when I said it's a two-way pincer attack?

470
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:23,480
It's actually gonna be a one-way attack.

471
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,240
I hope...

472
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,400
I hope it doesn't change the strategy too much, guys.

473
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,780
That one-way pincer attack that we all wanted in the beginning?

474
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

475
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,780
Yeah, yeah.

476
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,060
We all know pincer attacks are supposed to be one-way, right?

477
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,100
That's the whole point!

478
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,080
It's five.

479
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,200
It's gonna be it's so five.

480
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:57,560
Okay.

481
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,760
Okay, nice.

482
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,900
There we go.

483
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,300
We did it!

484
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,880
Okay, just one more left.

485
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,880
Just one guy.

486
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:10,720
Right here.

487
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,080
Oh, it's just the archer.

488
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,820
Alright, get outta here!

489
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,280
Get that archer outta here!

490
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,740
And then we should have a battering ram, right?

491
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:21,840
Okay.

492
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,780
Guys, that's alright, guys.

493
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,840
As long as they...

494
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,000
Everybody...

495
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,120
Who is fighting in the middle?

496
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,420
Oh my...

497
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,400
Okay, we gotta...

498
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,180
We gotta make sure...

499
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,340
How did he get there?

500
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,980
How did he get there?

501
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,020
Okay, let's go help.

502
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,740
Okay, that's not good.

503
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,540
That's not good.

504
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:47,920
Okay.

505
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,000
Don't worry.

506
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,020
Don't worry, I'm coming over.

507
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,280
Don't worry.

508
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,260
I'm almost there.

509
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:55,980
Oh my god.

510
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,640
Wait, he's taking them all there.

511
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,820
Oh, he wants to duel?

512
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,560
Who is he?

513
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,340
Oh, you wanna duel?

514
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,180
Give me a sec.

515
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,660
Oh, just...

516
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,280
Oh, you're like...

517
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,060
Finally, another fist stamp.

518
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:08,900
Give me a sec.

519
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,040
Let me...

520
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,740
Let me grab this real quick.

521
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,560
Let me...

522
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,740
Let me change this weapon real quick, guys.

523
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,040
He's like, finally!

524
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,460
Another fist stamp!

525
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,940
That's what I wanted to fight against!

526
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,820
Sorry, buddy.

527
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:38,700
No!

528
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,060
Fist stamp!

529
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,560
Alright, nice.

530
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,660
Alright, now...

531
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,300
Now, I'm going back to the fist.

532
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:49,560
Okay, now I'm going back to my...

533
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,340
To what I was actually trying to do.

534
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:53,720
Yeah.

535
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:55,660
Okay.

536
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,220
Can we break his stuff?

537
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,700
And then we get him out of here, too.

538
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:02,480
Alright.

539
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,040
Bye.

540
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:06,900
Oh, shit!

541
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:08,860
Goodbye.

542
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,660
That's all it takes.

543
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,700
Wait, there's like one more guy right here guarding the door.

544
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,860
He's like, surely there's nobody behind us, right?

545
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,720
Don't worry, guys.

546
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,660
I've got the front gate.

547
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,100
Alright, okay.

548
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,700
You guys won't fuck it up this time, right, dragons?

549
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,240
You guys got it.

550
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:30,500
Nice.

551
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,100
Boom!

552
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,780
That's right.

553
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,580
Okay, how's my objective now?

554
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:40,580
88?

555
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:41,600
Am I not...

556
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,060
Oh, yeah, I'm not using the battle armor.

557
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,280
I am absolutely not doing it correctly.

558
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,440
Oh, my God!

559
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,920
You guys finally got in!

560
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,080
Oh, my God!

561
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,460
Finally!

562
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,100
Everybody's dead by the way.

563
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:02,940
Everybody's dead.

564
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,760
But they did it, guys!

565
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,500
They fucking did it!

566
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,460
I'm proud of you guys.

567
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,420
You guys did it.

568
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,480
Wait, is that...

569
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,180
That's the...

570
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:17,900
Oh, that's the big guy.

571
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,600
Okay, I couldn't tell.

572
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,040
There's so many people here.

573
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,700
Wait, I have Extreme Musou!

574
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,260
But you know what that means.

575
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,700
It's Jo-Yu time.

576
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,300
That's fucking right.

577
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,380
And I can be angry!

578
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,020
Boom!

579
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,080
Oh, my God!

580
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,000
Okay, alright.

581
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,400
That was...

582
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,980
That was really fast.

583
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:44,480
Okay.

584
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,420
This is a little not fair right now.

585
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,400
Get over here.

586
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,800
That's fucking right.

587
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,650
Oh, you thought...

588
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,620
You thought you could do an unstoppable move?

589
00:28:59,060 --> 00:28:59,730
There's nothing...

590
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,340
There's no such thing as unstoppable moves.

591
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,360
Oh, and then I can do it again!

592
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,460
The double whammy!

593
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,060
Let's go!

594
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,960
Get over here!

595
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,100
I can be double angry!

596
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:17,820
That's right!

597
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,120
Nice.

598
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,340
It was just that easy.

599
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,360
I can be angry twice.

600
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,760
I have a lot of hate in me.

601
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:27,540
I...

602
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,740
There we go.

603
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,200
Hate is unlimited!

604
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,380
Yippee!

605
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:43,580
Mood.

606
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:50,540
Whoa!

607
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:52,620
Whoa!

608
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,960
Sun Tze doesn't mean that!

609
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,200
Sun Tze!

610
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,360
He doesn't mean that!

611
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,100
Sorry, guys.

612
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,580
We're just really good friends, too.

613
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,120
Papa Smurf!

614
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,120
Thank you for the super chat!

615
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,100
Thank you, thank you!

616
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:05,900
What's it like?

617
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,960
You heard that us Asians are so short because not doki systematically hunted down.

618
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,360
All it takes are people in ancient China!

619
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,100
Thank you for the super chat!

620
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,320
Thank you, thank you!

621
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,080
Kogashi!

622
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,260
Thank you for the super chat!

623
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,320
Thank you, thank you!

624
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,200
Joyu is my ROTK oshi.

625
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:24,980
I miss this.

626
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:25,520
I know!

627
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,060
Me, too!

628
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,760
I feel like the staff just doesn't...

629
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,140
I don't know.

630
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,660
I think the sword is more Joyu style.

631
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,620
I know they wanted more, like, unique.

632
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,960
Like, unique weapons for everybody.

633
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,460
But I honestly think the...

634
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:42,960
I honestly think Joyu's sword is just so iconic to him.

635
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,860
Okay, uh...

636
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:45,760
I want more meat buns.

637
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,880
We need more meat buns.

638
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:51,780
Alright.

639
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:52,980
Mission success.

640
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,460
We just need to do one more Sun Tien mission, I believe?

641
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:02,290
Yeah, the sword is just cooler.

642
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:02,630
Thank you, Joyu.

643
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,950
Everything worked out because of you.

644
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,730
I don't know what I'd do without you around.

645
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:09,310
Woah!

646
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,290
I could say the same for you.

647
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:11,830
Woah!

648
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,070
Are we just watching this?

649
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:23,430
Where am I?

650
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:26,050
Oh, I am watching this.

651
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:30,850
I am watching.

652
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:31,690
We're...

653
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:34,230
The whole family is watching?!

654
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,370
Holy shit!

655
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:42,610
The whole family is in the corner?!

656
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:43,150
Damn.

657
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:56,290
Derrick's... aww!

658
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:59,310
Oh my god, his dad approves!

659
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,630
Woah.

660
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:08,790
Yeah.

661
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:09,890
I don't...

662
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:10,350
You're not...

663
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:12,290
You're definitely not gonna willingly retire.

664
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:14,770
Don't worry, sir.

665
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:18,070
You're gonna be great to hear that you don't retire.

666
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:21,090
That night...

667
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:21,650
Oh, wait.

668
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,190
I don't like it when it goes nighttime.

669
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,490
Okay, that's good.

670
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:34,250
Okay, that's fine.

671
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,730
Nothing bad is happening at night.

672
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:41,630
Oh my god!

673
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:44,750
An Asian father actually giving him approval?

674
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,570
To his son?

675
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:50,690
Oh my god, this is rare.

676
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:02,110
This truly is a fantasy game.

677
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,890
Realistic!

678
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:38,390
Oh.

679
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:40,090
Um.

680
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:41,490
Woah.

681
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,490
Glad to hear that.

682
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:45,310
Guy who's gonna die soon.

683
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:47,570
Wow!

684
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:48,350
Sun Jian!

685
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:50,070
We're so in sync!

686
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:56,350
Wow!

687
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:57,710
Sun Jian!

688
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:00,170
We're so in sync!

689
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:01,130
Wow!

690
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:02,910
Excellent!

691
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,110
Thank you for the super chat!

692
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:04,490
Thank you!

693
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,190
Thank you!

694
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:08,650
We need Doki to react to Kung Fu and martial arts scenes in movies.

695
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:09,610
Thank you for the super chat!

696
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:09,930
Thank you!

697
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:10,590
Thank you!

698
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:17,590
He's self-aware.

699
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:32,970
Oh.

700
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,210
Does he have self-doubt?

701
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:36,390
About his lord?

702
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:46,190
Are you having doubt to our lord?

703
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,430
I'm gonna report you.

704
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:52,430
Yeah, what made you think so?

705
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:54,130
Huh?

706
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,110
Are you gonna defy our lord?

707
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,010
Sun Jian?

708
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:59,970
After everything he's done?

709
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:17,190
Okay.

710
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:19,290
Oh, okay.

711
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:19,850
Nice save.

712
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:20,430
Nice save.

713
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:20,930
You're right.

714
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:21,410
He is.

715
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,210
Alright, I won't report you.

716
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:25,370
I once aimed to be the same as him.

717
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,810
Or even surpass him.

718
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:30,070
But now I couldn't possibly.

719
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,390
It's okay guys, he saved it.

720
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:34,650
Anyway, that is enough ruminating for me.

721
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:36,590
It is time to focus.

722
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:43,130
Surviving these upcoming battles will require every ounce of our strength.

723
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:48,210
You will have a major part to play as well.

724
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:49,790
What do I have?

725
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:50,850
Oh, cool!

726
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:55,330
Another major part that I'll play where you're gonna re- And then you're just gonna rewrite me out of history.

727
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:56,910
That's pretty cool.

728
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,070
Yeah, I love doing that.

729
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,160
Hey there, guys.

730
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,100
Hey there, roommates.

731
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,640
Yeah, you're supposed to be talking about him.

732
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,720
What's with Yuan Shu?

733
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,140
Even Yuan Shao is no match for him.

734
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,420
Don't you agree?

735
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,280
I suppose you're right.

736
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:41,320
If Lord Sun Jian does defeat Liu Biao and take over Jing Province...

737
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,380
...it is feasible that we could gain control of the entire land.

738
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,380
Now, that would be something!

739
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,880
I'm only a background character.

740
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,360
Okay.

741
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:04,060
I'm pretty much... I'm just like an OC that's just watching everything unfold in history.

742
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,600
I'm like my self-insert.

743
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,020
I'm basically a self-insert right now.

744
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,640
Wait, what was that entire cutscene for?

745
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,740
I don't understand.

746
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,320
Hello, Zhou Yu.

747
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:41,230
Oh, shit.

748
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:43,110
Hello, Zhou Yu.

749
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,530
Hey, it is me.

750
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:55,130
You seem troubled.

751
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:59,150
Hello, or hello.

752
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:08,330
I'm listening.

753
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:12,890
Oh, wait, I'm supposed to be left-side Doki.

754
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:13,970
Fuck, I keep forgetting.

755
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:16,370
All right, right-side Doki.

756
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:17,210
Goodbye.

757
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:19,730
Okay, that's not right.

758
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:22,470
Okay, I need to remember which one's left-side Doki, guys.

759
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:31,990
All right, there we go.

760
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:44,890
Okay, he should be dead.

761
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:51,130
This is called like survival of the fittest and like natural selection.

762
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:53,790
Natural selection is literally trying to kill this guy.

763
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,330
Stop saving him.

764
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:59,030
You care about him deeply.

765
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:02,190
Okay, I'm just gonna be a wingman, I guess.

766
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:27,910
Yeah, we won.

767
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:37,610
Oh, but you can, right, Zhou Yu?

768
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:40,150
An interesting story.

769
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:43,550
Okay, I'm just like, uh-huh.

770
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:44,450
Yeah, that's interesting.

771
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,990
I wonder what you'll do next.

772
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:57,410
That's a cool story, bro.

773
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:11,890
Whoa!

774
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:14,270
Whoa!

775
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:27,810
Have you asked Sun Tzu's permission yet, though?

776
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:28,190
Have you?

777
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:32,210
Our fates are intertwined.

778
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:33,490
You heard that, guys?

779
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:36,850
Damn, they all want me.

780
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:39,850
My self-insert that I wrote myself in.

781
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:42,370
Okay, let's talk to this old man.

782
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:45,910
You must be that warrior I've heard about.

783
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:47,390
I can see in your face.

784
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:47,930
You're ready.

785
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:49,210
Take this with you.

786
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:50,090
Okay, nice.

787
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:51,110
Oh, I have the sword.

788
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:54,850
Okay, I gotta steal that.

789
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:59,410
All right, and then we'll do the- wait, what?

790
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,950
Oh, it's just weapons.

791
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:02,070
Okay, I thought that.

792
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:03,870
God, I'm still so poor.

793
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:05,730
Wait, I can sell some stuff.

794
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:06,230
Wait, I forgot.

795
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:08,710
I forgot my- the most important part.

796
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:09,610
Just selling stuff.

797
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:12,590
Oh, I almost sold- I almost wanted to sell this.

798
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:14,050
I did not see.

799
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:16,910
How strong- they're not like- okay, sword.

800
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:17,710
Okay, I was gonna say.

801
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:19,910
Oh, I didn't- you have to sort them yourself.

802
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:21,850
Oh, I see.

803
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:24,990
Okay, we're still selling that for sure.

804
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:27,310
And sell this.

805
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:30,890
Okay, sell that.

806
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:32,310
Almost there, guys.

807
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,430
We almost have enough.

808
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:36,590
Okay.

809
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:36,650
Okay.

810
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:40,410
Oh my god, we need a thousand more.

811
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:42,390
No, I'm still broke.

812
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:43,370
No.

813
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,430
No, wait, there's an offering.

814
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:49,190
I gotta go there.

815
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:51,990
Where am I?

816
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:55,710
Wait, where am I?

817
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:57,590
Oh, there's an offering there.

818
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:00,590
They've heard the tales.

819
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:03,030
Oh, I got mahogany.

820
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,070
Let's go.

821
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:07,850
Oh my god, they just gave me a fucking horse.

822
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:09,530
Nice.

823
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:11,590
What is this?

824
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:14,470
Is this where- Is this green or blue?

825
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:16,550
I can never tell anymore.

826
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:18,530
I can't tell.

827
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,130
Where is this?

828
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:23,870
Is this green or blue?

829
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:26,010
Someone tell me.

830
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,620
It's over here.

831
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,240
Oh, that's green, right?

832
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:36,020
Yeah, that's- oh, no, it's red.

833
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:39,700
It was neither.

834
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,300
Wait, am I- oh shit.

835
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,180
Okay, am I like high enough level?

836
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,840
Oh, yeah, I am.

837
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:47,500
All right.

838
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:50,740
Nice, it's red.

839
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,580
It was neither green or blue.

840
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:53,480
It was red.

841
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,520
All right.

842
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,260
All here?

843
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:05,880
Yes.

844
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,320
Leading the attack.

845
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:31,280
Now.

846
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:41,680
The enemy is currently- Uh, wait, maybe I can stop this from happening.

847
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,920
Breaking through their easy defense to defend- to attack the stronghold will take time.

848
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,820
Okay, let me look at this.

849
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,520
Okay, if I go from here...

850
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:58,200
to here and then I rush through everybody and then I'm gonna prevent history.

851
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:14,460
All right.

852
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:22,740
All right.

853
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,960
And I would like to ask you, Lord, uh...

854
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:32,120
Sun Jian to lead a separate force and push the entire front line forward.

855
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,300
By coordinating movements and breaking through the defense, we will make Xian Yan ours.

856
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,480
Make no mistake.

857
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,000
This will not be easy.

858
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:42,020
Lu Biao is formidable and this is his domain.

859
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:44,240
But we have an advantage here.

860
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:48,040
We will overwhelm the enemy and defeat them in one decisive blow.

861
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,080
I'll accompany Lord Sun Jian, not Zhou Qi.

862
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,680
I want you to support the main force.

863
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:58,080
Zhou Yu and the princess will also be there to assist Lord Sun Jian.

864
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,320
I trust you to do what you think is best.

865
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,420
All right, guys, don't worry.

866
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:04,140
I will change the fate.

867
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:10,100
I will change history!

868
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:15,320
Don't worry!

869
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,240
I got this!

870
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:23,520
All right, let me get my best weapon out there.

871
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:24,840
Don't worry, guys.

872
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,180
I shall change history!

873
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:30,200
Okay, I just need to go all the way down here.

874
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,600
And then, okay, this is what I'm gonna be doing, guys.

875
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:39,780
I gotta go all the way down here, take this cassa, and then go all the way around and then I'll reach him.

876
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,640
If you could change our fate, would ya?

877
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:47,700
All right, here we go.

878
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,960
I don't care how many gen- oh, shit.

879
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,580
Okay, this is not looking too good already.

880
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,960
I don't care how- oh, fuck.

881
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:58,380
This is not looking good already.

882
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:04,100
I- What the fuck?!

883
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:13,160
Okay, I don't care how many people will die, but we shall save- we shall change history!

884
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,040
Okay, I just have to keep going.

885
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:19,920
It'll be fine.

886
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,900
It's just that easy, guys.

887
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:24,440
Don't worry.

888
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,360
It's just that easy, guys.

889
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,400
I just gotta keep going for it.

890
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,180
There we go.

891
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,440
Don't worry, we're almost there!

892
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:37,240
I'm gonna change history!

893
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:39,780
Okay.

894
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:39,880
Okay.

895
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:42,500
Oh, shit.

896
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:43,500
Give me a sec.

897
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,100
Give me a sec.

898
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:46,320
Okay.

899
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,560
I need to get him out of the way real fast, though.

900
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:52,580
Oh, shit.

901
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:53,720
It's fine.

902
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:54,700
I finished it.

903
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:56,400
There we go.

904
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:58,160
Don't worry!

905
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,120
Trust me!

906
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,420
I shall change the fate!

907
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:06,100
Open the doors!

908
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,500
Wait, what the fuck?

909
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:10,640
Where did all these guys come from?

910
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:14,060
I don't think they noticed me, though.

911
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:14,820
It's fine.

912
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:17,500
Don't worry!

913
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,400
I can do this!

914
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,520
Don't worry, Sujin!

915
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:25,880
I'm coming over!

916
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,180
Okay, don't worry, we're almost there!

917
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:35,760
We're almost there!

918
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:36,980
Sujin!

919
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,040
Just give me a sec, Sujin!

920
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:44,580
It's okay, Sujin.

921
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:45,520
I'll be right back.

922
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:48,660
Give me a sec.

923
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:49,640
This is taking a little while.

924
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:52,560
This is taking a little while, though.

925
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:55,720
Please!

926
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,920
He takes so long to kill!

927
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:01,560
Don't kill their head!

928
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,360
Don't worry!

929
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:03,900
Don't worry!

930
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,580
I still need to kill this guy!

931
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:11,540
Okay.

932
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,240
Oh my god.

933
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,860
This is gonna take fucking forever.

934
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,720
Why are you so strong?

935
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:22,660
I'm fucking- I'm bringing another- Okay, I must have a stronger- I must have a stronger weapon.

936
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,420
Oh, it's just by one, though.

937
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:25,680
Goddamn it.

938
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:28,460
I knew I should not- if I didn't spend all that money.

939
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,880
If I didn't spend all that money.

940
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,700
Oh my god!

941
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:35,840
Why did I spend all the money on Lu Bu?!

942
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,320
Why?!

943
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:46,440
Why did I spend all that money?!

944
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:53,020
If only I had more money for a stronger weapon!

945
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,880
Oh my god!

946
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:01,960
Okay, that's fine.

947
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:02,960
Don't worry!

948
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,500
We can- we can still do this!

949
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:06,380
Open the gate!

950
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:07,540
Open the gate!

951
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:08,640
Open the gate!

952
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,800
I'm here to change the history of time!

953
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,260
We're almost there!

954
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:18,820
Surely, I can like open it from the back side, right?

955
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,540
Wait, can I just open it now?

956
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:22,860
Okay, good.

957
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:23,580
Okay, good.

958
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:24,880
All right, that's good.

959
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:26,240
I don't even have to kill him.

960
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:27,960
Okay, that is great.

961
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:29,320
I don't even have to kill this guy.

962
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,260
Come on, open the door!

963
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:38,760
No!

964
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:42,360
No!

965
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:44,540
No!

966
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:45,780
Don't, Sun Jian!

967
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:47,280
Stop!

968
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:51,020
No!

969
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:54,340
Somebody stop him!

970
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:55,300
Somebody!

971
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:56,140
No!

972
00:49:59,080 --> 00:49:59,720
No!

973
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:00,800
Somebody stop him!

974
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:04,040
We're so close!

975
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:06,340
No!

976
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:07,180
Cut him in half!

977
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,120
Oh my god!

978
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:10,680
No!

979
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,420
Beware what?

980
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,440
What?

981
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:25,780
What?

982
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:26,420
What the fuck?

983
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,500
Where am I?

984
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,040
Wait, what?

985
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:42,700
What the fuck?

986
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:46,480
What the fuck?

987
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,740
What the fuck?

988
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:50,460
What the fuck?

989
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:51,240
What the fuck?

990
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:52,180
No!

991
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,980
He won't let me change history!

992
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,120
I'm so fucked up!

993
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:00,640
Why?

994
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:01,660
What the fuck?

995
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,000
I can't believe it!

996
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:09,380
I'm not allowed to change history!

997
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:13,460
They're like...

998
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:15,020
It was not planned!

999
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:17,360
That's not fair!

1000
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:20,020
I worked so hard to get here!

1001
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:23,800
What do you mean I'm not allowed to change history?

1002
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:28,940
I can't believe it!

1003
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:31,760
How am I supposed to kill him?

1004
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:34,320
The top police is here!

1005
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:35,880
Oh my god!

1006
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:38,460
I'm actually not allowed to change history!

1007
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:39,360
That's not fair!

1008
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,220
I'm so messed up!

1009
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:43,700
How do I kill him?

1010
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,240
Yes!

1011
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:48,680
I want to save him!

1012
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:54,020
Oh my god!

1013
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:55,020
I can't save him!

1014
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,540
I can't save him!

1015
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:57,560
I'm so low!

1016
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,640
Holy shit!

1017
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,840
What the fuck?

1018
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:10,460
Guys...

1019
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:14,440
Guys, I don't think I can save him.

1020
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:17,580
Guys...

1021
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:18,860
Guys...

1022
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:20,780
I don't think...

1023
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:21,780
Guys...

1024
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:29,100
Guys, the top police got me!

1025
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:30,380
Guys...

1026
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:32,580
I don't think I'm meant to...

1027
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:35,820
I don't think I'm meant to save him!

1028
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,480
I just gotta get good!

1029
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,120
Believe in yourself.

1030
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,380
This is the hardest date.

1031
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,340
You can alter fate?

1032
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:50,320
Wait!

1033
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:51,760
Are you serious?

1034
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,980
Wait, how many fates have I forgot to alter?

1035
00:52:55,500 --> 00:53:00,740
I'm not an actual thing.

1036
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:05,020
Wait, have I missed out on other alterations?

1037
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,920
Oh, this is the first one.

1038
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:08,420
Okay.

1039
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:11,980
Okay.

1040
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:14,100
Okay, guys, I don't think I can save him.

1041
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:18,080
Guys, the time police kicked my ass, guys.

1042
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:21,420
Guys, the time police...

1043
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,860
Guys, the time police kicked my ass.

1044
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,060
I don't think I can... Goodbye.

1045
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:31,300
Goodbye.

1046
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,700
It's too late.

1047
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:41,560
Never give up.

1048
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:43,640
Goodbye, soon-chan.

1049
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:44,460
I tried.

1050
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:50,420
Never mess with history, guys.

1051
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:52,920
Don't mess with history, guys.

1052
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:54,120
I've learned my lessons.

1053
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:57,860
Don't leave.

1054
00:53:58,220 --> 00:53:59,780
You're just gonna let him...

1055
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:02,240
Guys, we tried, okay?

1056
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,460
At least I can say I tried.

1057
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:11,820
Okay, guys, I tried to alter fate.

1058
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:13,940
Okay, that's better than anything.

1059
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:19,000
Is it trying better than not doing nothing, guys?

1060
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,080
Guys, at least I tried.

1061
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:25,440
It's better than doing nothing, guys.

1062
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:28,260
It's better than doing nothing, though.

1063
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:31,780
Don't...

1064
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:34,260
Don't... Exactly.

1065
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,660
I did my best.

1066
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:39,040
I did my best.

1067
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:41,280
It's okay.

1068
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,240
It was meant to die anyway.

1069
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,700
It was a canon event.

1070
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,020
It's worse because you wasted time.

1071
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:51,860
But I did it, though.

1072
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,600
I did it.

1073
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:55,940
I tried my best.

1074
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:59,240
This is all that matters.

1075
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:01,040
I tried my best.

1076
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:03,620
There we go.

1077
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:04,760
I did it.

1078
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:09,500
There we go.

1079
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:20,440
Yeah, like, you know, he already lived for a very long time, though.

1080
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:25,280
He already, like, lived for as long as he could.

1081
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,220
So he should be happy about that.

1082
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:31,780
He, like...

1083
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:33,860
He, like, lived for so long.

1084
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,240
It's fine.

1085
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:35,980
It's fine.

1086
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,280
That's fine.

1087
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,360
It's fine.

1088
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:48,660
We knew he was gonna die anyway.

1089
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,420
We were all set up for it, guys.

1090
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,660
It's not like we didn't know.

1091
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:54,720
No.

1092
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:55,800
No, it's okay.

1093
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:57,120
No, it's fine.

1094
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:58,660
I don't...

1095
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:02,840
It's okay.

1096
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:04,460
No, it's fine.

1097
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:05,840
I don't need to save him.

1098
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:09,560
I already know what's gonna happen to me.

1099
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,300
What the fuck am I trying to kill?

1100
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:25,660
Alright, nice.

1101
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:28,320
Come on!

1102
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:33,280
If Lu Bu was here, he would've... No, it's fine.

1103
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:34,740
It's okay.

1104
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,640
Go in there, dragoons!

1105
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:47,500
It's fine.

1106
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:56,460
Alright, goodbye, Sun Jian.

1107
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:57,420
It was great knowing you.

1108
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:00,140
I'm sorry the time police stopped me.

1109
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:03,100
Look.

1110
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:03,980
Look.

1111
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,180
They sent their best, okay?

1112
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:09,780
They sent really strong people.

1113
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,040
What was I supposed to do, guys?

1114
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,960
What could I have done, guys?

1115
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:19,800
What could I have done differently?

1116
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:21,680
I've done everything I could.

1117
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:25,500
Try harder.

1118
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:31,700
The hell?

1119
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:32,920
How do you do this one?

1120
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:36,980
Regis, defeat with X attacks from either...

1121
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:43,400
How do I do this one?

1122
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:51,520
Am I doing this correctly?

1123
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:52,460
I can't tell.

1124
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:56,960
Okay, nice.

1125
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:00,980
It's fine.

1126
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:05,900
Oh my god, it's not fine!

1127
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,500
There's too many people in front of me.

1128
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,420
Like, where...

1129
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:12,940
I can't see anything!

1130
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,980
What's going on?!

1131
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:22,080
What's going on?!

1132
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:24,520
Okay, it's fine.

1133
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:26,500
It's not fine, but it's fine.

1134
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:29,900
It's not fine.

1135
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:31,620
I do not feel okay right now.

1136
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:35,320
There's way too many things going on.

1137
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:39,540
Oh my god!

1138
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,500
Oh my god!

1139
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:43,180
Oh my god!

1140
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:44,500
I can't move!

1141
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:45,400
I'm kidding.

1142
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:46,940
I can't move.

1143
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:49,760
I actually can't move right now.

1144
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:54,000
There's so many of them.

1145
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:58,540
Oh my god!

1146
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,760
What's going on?!

1147
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:01,460
I...

1148
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:05,760
What the fuck is going on?!

1149
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:07,040
Oh!

1150
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:09,140
Okay.

1151
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:10,440
Okay, it's fine.

1152
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:11,840
It's fine.

1153
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:13,420
It's not fine.

1154
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:17,880
Now this is how I imagine times 2 Warriors.

1155
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:22,460
Guys, we knew this was gonna happen.

1156
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:24,920
We were prepared, like, since part 1, guys.

1157
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:33,200
Oh!

1158
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,680
Oh shit!

1159
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:40,900
Oh shit!

1160
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:47,760
What a way to go, guys.

1161
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:53,200
Imagine just getting a giant rock thrown at you.

1162
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:55,920
That's it.

1163
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,340
Yeah, that's how he dies, apparently.

1164
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:01,720
No, not the morale!

1165
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,360
Please, I'm going through so much right now.

1166
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,080
I can't fucking move!

1167
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,020
I can't move.

1168
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:18,600
We'll retreat?

1169
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:20,360
I just...

1170
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:21,400
What the fuck?

1171
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,920
I went through so much.

1172
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:24,800
Would you be more gonna retreat?

1173
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:33,340
I went through so much and he's gonna call for a retreat?!

1174
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:36,120
That's so fucked up.

1175
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:39,240
This is... I don't even know what's going on.

1176
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,500
And he's gonna call for a retreat.

1177
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:43,680
This is fucked up.

1178
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:47,000
What do you mean, Dragoon?

1179
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,240
What do you mean?!

1180
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,560
We've been through so much!

1181
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:53,040
What the fuck do you mean we gotta fall back?!

1182
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:59,040
What the fuck do you mean fall back?!

1183
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:02,120
We had to go through so much!

1184
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:07,420
Fall back.

1185
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
There we go.

1186
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:14,100
I'm gonna kill him.

1187
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:15,380
I don't care.

1188
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,500
I'm gonna kill him if it's the last thing I do.

1189
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:24,480
It's harder than Lu Bu?!

1190
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:25,980
That's crazy.

1191
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:35,740
That's actually crazy that this is considered harder than Lu Bu.

1192
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:37,800
Oh my god.

1193
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,220
Oh my god!

1194
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:40,600
Get me out of here!

1195
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:45,240
Get me out of here!

1196
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:46,960
Please.

1197
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:48,580
Let me just kill him.

1198
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,460
At least grant me that pleasure.

1199
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:58,560
At least grant me this pleasure of killing this guy.

1200
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:01,020
I don't know who he is.

1201
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:02,820
I just wanna kill him.

1202
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:03,280
Please.

1203
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:04,280
Please.

1204
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:05,440
I just...

1205
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:07,860
That is literally the one thing I want in life.

1206
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:08,900
Just grant me that.

1207
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:10,360
There we go.

1208
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:14,380
Okay, now I'll go back.

1209
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:18,880
That's all I want.

1210
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:20,340
Just grant me that pleasure.

1211
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:21,840
I don't care.

1212
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:25,420
Okay.

1213
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,080
I went through so much, guys.

1214
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:30,900
I went through so much.

1215
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:32,680
Okay, now I can start fisting again.

1216
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,260
I need to figure out how to...

1217
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:37,660
Oh shit.

1218
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:41,200
Okay.

1219
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:45,700
I'm trying to figure out how to do the other thing for this.

1220
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:50,240
Okay.

1221
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:51,420
Get that battle in.

1222
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:53,380
Okay.

1223
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:54,340
I think it's this, right?

1224
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:55,100
Did I do it?

1225
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:55,920
I don't know.

1226
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:57,420
Oh my god!

1227
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:58,000
Please, PC!

1228
01:02:58,140 --> 01:02:58,360
Live!

1229
01:02:58,360 --> 01:02:58,600
Live!

1230
01:02:58,600 --> 01:02:58,780
Live!

1231
01:02:58,800 --> 01:02:59,300
Live, PC!

1232
01:02:59,560 --> 01:02:59,880
Live!

1233
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:00,460
Live!

1234
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:01,020
Live!

1235
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:01,660
Live!

1236
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:02,560
Don't live!

1237
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,220
I need you to live, PC!

1238
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:11,540
I don't want to watch the Jedi again!

1239
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:15,520
Oh, look at that.

1240
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:18,160
Wow, he's not here to fucking stop me this time.

1241
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,920
The time police realized that I failed.

1242
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:23,740
Okay.

1243
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:26,420
That's right.

1244
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:27,040
Get out of here.

1245
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:28,060
Okay.

1246
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:28,560
Nice.

1247
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:29,040
Counter.

1248
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:29,100
Okay.

1249
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:31,240
That's fucking right.

1250
01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:33,860
Get out of here!

1251
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:36,620
Alright.

1252
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:37,760
Is there any bread?

1253
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:38,720
Any bread?

1254
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:40,380
Any fucking bread for me?

1255
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:41,060
Oh, nope.

1256
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:41,420
Alright.

1257
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:42,460
Fuck me, I guess.

1258
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:47,540
Um, yeah.

1259
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:49,780
We sort of, like, threw a rock on him.

1260
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:50,940
And he sort of died.

1261
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:53,680
I like how he just steered up.

1262
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,040
I guess, like, you can't really dodge a rock, you know?

1263
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,120
I'm a wiser.

1264
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:03,280
I could have avoided this.

1265
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:06,360
I fucking hate these guys to lose.

1266
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,740
I- I like this so hard!

1267
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:12,640
HUNG GUY, PLEASE GET OVER HERE AND HELP!

1268
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:15,280
HUNG GUY!

1269
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:17,900
I CAN'T APPROACH!

1270
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:21,140
Oh my go- Okay, that's okay.

1271
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:22,400
The family helped.

1272
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:24,480
It's okay.

1273
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:25,940
The family helped out.

1274
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:27,400
I really appreciate it.

1275
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,660
I really appreciate it.

1276
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:31,660
Okay, we finally finished that stance.

1277
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:34,900
Jesus Christ, I hated that stance so much.

1278
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,260
Okay, sword time.

1279
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:38,620
Sword time.

1280
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:40,760
Okay, get out of here.

1281
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:43,020
Any fellow breads in chat?

1282
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:44,220
Any?

1283
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:47,060
Any breads in chat?

1284
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:50,200
I need some bread.

1285
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:52,180
What do you mean?

1286
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,680
We're, like, next to each other.

1287
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:53,780
Okay.

1288
01:04:55,940 --> 01:04:57,440
What do you mean?

1289
01:04:58,420 --> 01:04:59,200
Eat your bread!

1290
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:00,960
Eat your bread, everybody!

1291
01:05:01,180 --> 01:05:01,320
Good!

1292
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:02,840
Okay, there we go.

1293
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:03,820
They did it.

1294
01:05:04,060 --> 01:05:05,040
Oh, there he is!

1295
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:06,020
Wait, I should kill this guy.

1296
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:06,820
I forgot about him.

1297
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:09,680
Oh my god.

1298
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:11,600
Jesus Christ.

1299
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:17,040
This is a little worrying because, um, I have no HP.

1300
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:21,840
This is very worrying, guys.

1301
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:26,680
I have no HP right now for this fight.

1302
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:30,880
How do they have all the bread?

1303
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:34,820
I should be able to eat some of their bread, too, afterwards.

1304
01:05:35,540 --> 01:05:37,780
If I see my allies, I should get healed.

1305
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:41,680
Like, how come they can get healed but I can't?

1306
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:44,440
Oh my god, that's fine.

1307
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:45,920
I just need to do one hit.

1308
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:47,640
I just need to do one more hit.

1309
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:48,680
There we go.

1310
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:50,280
Oh, thank god.

1311
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,660
Thank god he held bread on him.

1312
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:55,080
Alright.

1313
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,200
Can you escape now?

1314
01:05:58,360 --> 01:05:59,520
Can you guys escape now?

1315
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:01,040
Alright, don't worry.

1316
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:02,080
I'll kill him for you.

1317
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:03,920
Oh shit, Julia!

1318
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:04,360
Julia!

1319
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:05,780
I forgot to give you bread!

1320
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:08,920
I forgot!

1321
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:12,520
The one guy that was crying for bread and I never gave him.

1322
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:14,560
I never gave him the bread.

1323
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:16,400
Whoops, my bad.

1324
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:18,680
My bad.

1325
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:19,460
That was my bad.

1326
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:20,040
I'm sorry.

1327
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:24,040
I forgot you were the one that asked for it.

1328
01:06:29,540 --> 01:06:32,400
Okay, let's kill him real fast.

1329
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:36,400
Guys, see?

1330
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:40,500
It doesn't matter if I save Sun Jian because I wasn't going to do his route anyway.

1331
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:45,400
Okay, we'll let these guys deal with the other two.

1332
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,380
Okay, we need to help Sun Jian escape here.

1333
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:51,680
Wait, is he actually in danger?

1334
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
There's no way.

1335
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:54,720
That's silly.

1336
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:55,840
OH FUCK!

1337
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:58,740
He ate your bread!

1338
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:03,560
See?

1339
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:05,140
He's not in danger now.

1340
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:09,880
Guys, look.

1341
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:10,120
See?

1342
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:14,340
He's not in danger now, guys.

1343
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:15,720
It's fine.

1344
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,640
It's fine, guys.

1345
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:21,540
He's okay now.

1346
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:25,380
That's all that matters.

1347
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:30,080
Oh shit, the veterans are here.

1348
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:32,260
Okay, arrows.

1349
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:33,080
This is it.

1350
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:35,720
This is your time to shine.

1351
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:39,580
Is he doing it?

1352
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:40,820
Oh my god, he's doing it!

1353
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:44,160
He's doing it!

1354
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:45,320
He's doing it!

1355
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:45,940
Get him out of here!

1356
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:46,880
Get out!

1357
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:51,220
Oh my god, he's so much taller!

1358
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:53,860
Why is he so tall?

1359
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:56,520
He's so fucking tall!

1360
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:59,480
It's not fair!

1361
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:04,620
Bro, he's not even fighting back!

1362
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:06,900
He's just fucking sending people else to die!

1363
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:08,380
Just like a true general.

1364
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:09,380
Oh, nice.

1365
01:08:09,860 --> 01:08:11,280
I can take his staff too.

1366
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,420
Nice, he's going for mine now.

1367
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:15,040
Alright.

1368
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:17,000
I'll help out the others.

1369
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:19,640
Kill him!

1370
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:22,180
Your kings must die!

1371
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:22,640
You're right.

1372
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:25,680
Alright.

1373
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:26,780
We gotta kill him too.

1374
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,660
I need to know what- What is my objective?

1375
01:08:30,820 --> 01:08:31,780
Okay, not this one.

1376
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:33,000
What's the sword one?

1377
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:42,840
Tactics, launch a successful charge, Sword training, Sword training, Defeat 200 foes with battle arts.

1378
01:08:42,940 --> 01:08:45,160
Oh my god, it's just literally all battle arts.

1379
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:46,520
Okay.

1380
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:48,240
Don't worry.

1381
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:49,980
I'm here for you guys!

1382
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:53,040
I'm here for the short king!

1383
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:58,680
If we eliminate all the tall people, then we can win.

1384
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:01,540
We just gotta eliminate all the tall people.

1385
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:04,200
Okay.

1386
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:04,240
Let's go.

1387
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:06,560
Let's get rid of this guy.

1388
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:15,280
Then the short- Guys, then the short king will become- The short king will become the tall people.

1389
01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:17,840
If we just eliminate all the taller people.

1390
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:22,100
Okay, I'm just gonna kill these guys.

1391
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:23,220
With this.

1392
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,560
I'm ready to get mad.

1393
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:27,620
Eat the tall.

1394
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:29,620
Then we will become tall.

1395
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:30,000
Oh my god.

1396
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:35,300
We'll become the thing that we sell to destroy.

1397
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:38,480
That's fucking right.

1398
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:40,600
I won't have it any other way.

1399
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:46,440
Then you'll have to eliminate the short kings.

1400
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:48,220
Right after.

1401
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:49,460
Get out.

1402
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:51,340
I need your bread.

1403
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:53,940
God, you're so not important.

1404
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:54,660
Oh no, no.

1405
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:55,720
It's fine.

1406
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:57,320
He'll come back.

1407
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:03,060
Give me a sec.

1408
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:04,180
I'll come back soon.

1409
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:05,340
Give me a sec.

1410
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:08,720
Oh my god, please.

01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:10,700
I'm dealing with this right now.

1412
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:12,600
You'll be fine.

1413
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:16,120
You'll be fine.

1414
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:18,500
You'll be so fine.

1415
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:21,440
I just need to kill him real quick.

1416
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:23,300
I swear to god I'll come back.

1417
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:26,100
Okay, nice.

1418
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:27,960
Okay, nice.

1419
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:31,860
Okay, he's almost dead.

1420
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:33,400
I swear to god I'll come back for you.

1421
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:35,860
There we go.

1422
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:39,180
Nice.

1423
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:39,880
I did it.

1424
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:41,160
Okay, I'll come back for you guys.

1425
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:41,800
I swear to god.

1426
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:42,820
I swear to god.

1427
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:43,240
I promise.

1428
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:44,400
I'm coming over.

1429
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:46,260
I'm coming over, guys.

1430
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:46,900
Oh my god.

1431
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:48,360
I swear to god.

1432
01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:49,620
Just eat your bread.

1433
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:51,080
Eat your bread, everybody.

1434
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:52,360
Eat your bread.

1435
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:53,980
Oh my god.

1436
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:55,760
Oh, okay, okay.

1437
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:56,700
She's okay.

1438
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:57,460
She's okay.

1439
01:10:57,460 --> 01:10:58,160
Oh, shit.

1440
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:02,400
Oh, shit.

1441
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:06,200
Oh, fuck.

1442
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,100
Okay, sister, you gotta get out of here.

1443
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:09,860
You actually gotta get out of here.

1444
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:12,400
You actually...

1445
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:13,880
Oh, no.

1446
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:15,480
Oh, this is awkward.

1447
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:19,300
This is a little awkward.

1448
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:20,940
This is awkward.

1449
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:23,320
Okay, it's fine.

1450
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:24,300
It's fine.

1451
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:25,420
He's okay, guys.

1452
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:27,280
Guys, he's okay, guys.

1453
01:11:28,060 --> 01:11:28,660
He's...

1454
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:30,240
He's okay, everybody.

1455
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:33,700
No close shaves at all.

1456
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,480
He's all fucked up.

1457
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:36,980
Oh, shit.

1458
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:38,960
I'm not okay, though.

1459
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:40,780
Bro,

1460
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,320
where are you?

1461
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:46,840
Okay, okay.

1462
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:47,640
I made him eat bread.

1463
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:50,100
I told you it would be fine.

1464
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:50,780
Let's get serious.

1465
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,640
He's so strong.

1466
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:01,360
Why is he so strong?

1467
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:04,100
Okay.

1468
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:07,180
Everything was fine.

1469
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:08,900
Come on, guys, please.

1470
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:10,940
Please, guys.

1471
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:11,660
Please.

1472
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:15,960
I watched him die in front of me.

1473
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:18,120
Oh, my God.

1474
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:22,220
Jesus Christ.

1475
01:12:25,780 --> 01:12:28,580
I'm trying my best right now.

1476
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:32,200
There's so many people.

1477
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:36,840
Jesus.

1478
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:39,140
Okay.

1479
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:40,500
Oh, my God.

1480
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:41,220
I'm 1 HP.

1481
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:42,340
I'm 1 HP.

1482
01:12:42,340 --> 01:12:42,400
I'm 1 HP.

1483
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:44,440
Please.

1484
01:12:45,140 --> 01:12:47,060
I'm blocking everything I can.

1485
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:50,500
I'm blocking everything I can right now.

1486
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:53,300
Okay.

1487
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:54,100
Oh, my God.

1488
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:54,860
Please give me your bread.

1489
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:56,140
Oh, thank God.

1490
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:57,580
I live a little bit longer.

1491
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:03,820
Jesus Christ.

1492
01:13:03,940 --> 01:13:05,040
They're so strong.

1493
01:13:06,140 --> 01:13:06,700
Blasted.

1494
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:07,100
I'm dead.

1495
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:11,140
Okay.

1496
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:14,160
Live.

1497
01:13:14,380 --> 01:13:15,300
Just live.

1498
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:20,760
I'm trying my best to kill them.

1499
01:13:21,220 --> 01:13:23,160
I'm literally a one-man army.

1500
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:27,800
Oh, my God.

1501
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:28,860
Why are you running?

1502
01:13:33,890 --> 01:13:35,390
What the fuck?

1503
01:13:38,090 --> 01:13:38,850
Okay.

1504
01:13:39,930 --> 01:13:41,110
Actually, fuck you, though.

1505
01:13:42,230 --> 01:13:45,150
Actually, fuck you for running away.

1506
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:48,450
I'm like trying to...

1507
01:13:48,450 --> 01:13:52,170
I'm trying to fucking do my best.

1508
01:13:53,810 --> 01:13:54,570
Okay.

1509
01:13:54,670 --> 01:13:56,070
I'm not letting you do this.

1510
01:13:57,050 --> 01:13:59,070
Yeah, you're not getting away with that.

1511
01:13:59,830 --> 01:14:01,590
I am trying to end this.

1512
01:14:02,130 --> 01:14:03,350
Don't worry.

1513
01:14:07,210 --> 01:14:08,370
Wait, did somebody die?

1514
01:14:09,010 --> 01:14:10,050
Oh, he made it.

1515
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:10,930
Oh, my God.

1516
01:14:10,990 --> 01:14:11,590
He made it.

1517
01:14:11,930 --> 01:14:13,170
Oh, my God.

1518
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:14,690
I can't even take him.

1519
01:14:14,990 --> 01:14:16,530
I can't even take his soul.

1520
01:14:16,850 --> 01:14:17,730
Okay, it's fine.

1521
01:14:17,970 --> 01:14:18,450
It's fine.

1522
01:14:18,650 --> 01:14:19,350
We don't need it.

1523
01:14:19,410 --> 01:14:20,790
We don't need his fucking soul.

1524
01:14:21,150 --> 01:14:22,510
We don't need it.

1525
01:14:22,850 --> 01:14:24,430
Usagi, thank you for the super chat.

1526
01:14:24,550 --> 01:14:24,850
Thank you.

1527
01:14:24,910 --> 01:14:25,430
Thank you.

1528
01:14:25,610 --> 01:14:28,890
I respect you, your talent, and your life choices, but I'm loyal to Lu Bu.

1529
01:14:29,270 --> 01:14:31,070
Thank you for the super chat, Usagi.

1530
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:31,630
Thank you.

1531
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:32,310
Thank you.

1532
01:14:34,290 --> 01:14:35,750
All right, let's see.

1533
01:14:36,370 --> 01:14:38,010
What did I completed?

1534
01:14:38,210 --> 01:14:39,210
Okay, I completed that.

1535
01:14:40,290 --> 01:14:40,830
Nice.

1536
01:14:41,630 --> 01:14:42,190
Nice.

1537
01:14:43,410 --> 01:14:46,110
Okay, I just need to do 200 and 300 more.

1538
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:47,310
Oh, nice.

1539
01:14:47,390 --> 01:14:48,190
I completed a lot.

1540
01:14:48,390 --> 01:14:48,790
Whoa.

1541
01:14:49,410 --> 01:14:49,810
Okay.

1542
01:14:51,390 --> 01:14:53,650
I don't know how to do this one.

1543
01:14:53,930 --> 01:14:56,090
The dramatic success one is really difficult.

1544
01:14:59,390 --> 01:15:01,190
Okay, we're never completing that.

1545
01:15:02,170 --> 01:15:04,010
We're never completing that.

1546
01:15:04,670 --> 01:15:06,410
Uh, all right.

1547
01:15:07,650 --> 01:15:08,370
Nice.

1548
01:15:09,330 --> 01:15:09,570
Wait.

1549
01:15:10,510 --> 01:15:11,210
Oh.

1550
01:15:12,050 --> 01:15:13,450
I want to step on them.

1551
01:15:14,490 --> 01:15:16,330
Okay, we definitely need this.

1552
01:15:16,650 --> 01:15:18,770
Like, fuck the arrows.

1553
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:21,430
Actually, fuck the arrows.

1554
01:15:23,590 --> 01:15:26,330
They're the bane of my existence right now.

1555
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:32,980
Um, Alcarion, thank you for the super chat.

1556
01:15:32,980 --> 01:15:33,340
Thank you.

1557
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:34,020
Thank you.

1558
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:35,840
I saved Sun Jian in my first playthrough.

1559
01:15:36,180 --> 01:15:37,580
It was way harder than beating Lu Bu.

1560
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:40,580
And since I wasn't doing Lu's story first, it was a waste of time.

1561
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:41,520
Thank you for the super chat.

1562
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:41,840
Thank you.

1563
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:42,020
Thank you.

1564
01:15:42,020 --> 01:15:43,060
See, it doesn't matter.

1565
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:46,220
It doesn't matter that he died, guys.

1566
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:48,540
Look, the time police was just way too strong.

1567
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:49,280
I can't do it.

1568
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:51,660
This is my failure.

1569
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:54,560
An irreparable one at that.

1570
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:02,040
Is that meant to shoot?

1571
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:31,560
Oh yeah, I know.

1572
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:33,060
I fucking killed a lot of them.

1573
01:16:33,580 --> 01:16:34,640
They literally killed one.

1574
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:36,880
Okay, they killed a lot of our generals too.

1575
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:37,940
But they're okay.

1576
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:39,400
They're just wounded.

1577
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:42,640
But I killed a lot of their generals.

1578
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:42,740
I don't know.

1579
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:17,500
That's right.

1580
01:17:18,020 --> 01:17:20,820
Sun Jian who has lived a very good long life as well.

1581
01:17:21,260 --> 01:17:23,060
Nothing's gonna happen to him too.

1582
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:36,980
Alright.

1583
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:37,680
Cool.

1584
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:44,200
Sorry to say that after this, I'm not gonna do anything with you guys after.

1585
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:50,180
Aw, Sun Jian.

1586
01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:53,300
That's so rough, buddy.

1587
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:55,180
But I'm still picking green.

1588
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:01,840
That's rough, man.

1589
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:19,580
Tell me what?

1590
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:25,760
Zhou Yu!

1591
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:28,880
You're gonna leave your...

1592
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:29,160
Why?

1593
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:33,840
Just because he's depressed, you don't just leave him?

1594
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:35,900
Oh my god.

1595
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,300
That's not true love, guys.

1596
01:18:37,940 --> 01:18:40,680
He's leaving him when he needs him the most.

1597
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:47,340
Depressed?

1598
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:48,000
Depression?

1599
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:50,680
Not a true homie.

1600
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:04,360
Yeah, but...

1601
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:05,260
Shouldn't we help directly?

1602
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:07,320
Yeah, shouldn't we help directly, Zhou Yu?

1603
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:16,500
That doesn't matter!

1604
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:21,220
He needs the comfort of his really, really, really good friend and roommate.

1605
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:27,180
He needs comfort!

1606
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:29,980
Especially at...

1607
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:39,280
Alright.

1608
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:43,300
Peace has...

1609
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:44,260
Yo, I received a letter!

1610
01:19:44,820 --> 01:19:46,780
Oh my god, another super chat?

1611
01:19:51,060 --> 01:19:52,580
Oh shit, okay, no.

1612
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,080
Let's meet up for...

1613
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,960
You are not...

1614
01:19:55,960 --> 01:20:00,640
You are not relevant enough to score this character.

1615
01:20:01,580 --> 01:20:02,940
Not Doki, are you well?

1616
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:05,300
Please forgive me for treating you so coldly.

1617
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:08,820
If you ever find yourself in need of help, you need but ask.

1618
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:13,560
If it's for you, I would be willing to do everything in my power to be of assistance.

1619
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:16,520
As for me, I finally got a hold of myself.

1620
01:20:16,780 --> 01:20:23,260
I decided to focus my efforts solely on what I can do right now to prepare for the coming restoration of the House of Sun.

1621
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:24,260
Alright.

1622
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:25,980
Remember that place we went?

1623
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:30,460
Sorry Hongdae, I went to a lot of places with a lot of different generals.

1624
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:31,960
You gotta be more specific.

1625
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:35,940
I wanna go again, so join me for a spell.

1626
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:38,160
Why am I inviting you, you ask?

1627
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:39,060
It's simple.

1628
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:41,720
You're not the type to let people down.

1629
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:44,100
That much is very clear to me.

1630
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:47,340
Sorry to take advantage of your sense of responsibility.

1631
01:20:47,620 --> 01:20:50,280
Oh my god, he's guilt tripping me because he's so pathetic.

1632
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:52,160
Oh my god.

1633
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:56,400
Oh my god.

1634
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:57,360
He...

1635
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:00,060
He...

1636
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:00,840
Alright.

1637
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:02,500
Alright.

1638
01:21:03,140 --> 01:21:05,460
Those are inside thoughts.

1639
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:07,520
Okay, where is he?

1640
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:10,060
Where is he?

1641
01:21:10,060 --> 01:21:10,400
Where is this guy?

1642
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:11,600
Alright.

1643
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:14,820
I don't remember.

1644
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:19,400
Guys, he said, do you remember that time where we ate that meal together?

1645
01:21:19,580 --> 01:21:20,260
I don't.

1646
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:22,720
I do not remember, man.

1647
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,160
Why would I remember?

1648
01:21:26,140 --> 01:21:27,440
Oh my god.

1649
01:21:27,540 --> 01:21:28,900
Where is he?

1650
01:21:30,740 --> 01:21:32,360
It just says shampoo.

1651
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:33,140
It doesn't even...

1652
01:21:33,140 --> 01:21:33,860
Oh, there he is.

1653
01:21:34,340 --> 01:21:34,740
Okay.

1654
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:39,420
There it is.

1655
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:40,500
I found the restaurant.

1656
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:44,520
Wait, I should be able to afford the strong weapons now.

1657
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:45,240
Okay, I can.

1658
01:21:46,940 --> 01:21:47,720
Which one?

1659
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:49,740
This is the...

1660
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:52,040
Orchids is the strongest, right?

1661
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:57,400
Guys, is it the orchids or the sword that's the strongest weapon?

1662
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:00,200
Which one was it?

1663
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:02,000
I can only buy one.

1664
01:22:04,740 --> 01:22:06,040
Which one was it, guys?

1665
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:06,860
I don't remember.

1666
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:07,540
Chat.

1667
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:08,600
Orchids?

1668
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:08,980
Okay.

1669
01:22:09,980 --> 01:22:11,280
Wait, one guy said it.

1670
01:22:14,570 --> 01:22:16,450
I need to know the strongest...

1671
01:22:16,450 --> 01:22:17,270
Okay, okay.

1672
01:22:17,730 --> 01:22:18,950
I'll buy the orchids then.

1673
01:22:20,530 --> 01:22:21,050
Nice.

1674
01:22:22,730 --> 01:22:23,250
Alright.

1675
01:22:30,950 --> 01:22:31,550
I'm back.

1676
01:22:34,630 --> 01:22:35,150
Wow!

1677
01:22:36,990 --> 01:22:37,510
First...

1678
01:22:41,550 --> 01:22:42,990
The first...

1679
01:22:43,810 --> 01:22:46,490
Really, the first thing you're gonna say.

1680
01:22:47,030 --> 01:22:48,670
He's a bottom.

1681
01:22:48,730 --> 01:22:49,830
Oh my god.

1682
01:22:54,450 --> 01:22:58,850
Oh, that's so sad.

1683
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:04,070
That's so sad, bro.

1684
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:10,220
Oh, baby.

1685
01:23:11,060 --> 01:23:13,040
That's so sad.

1686
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:15,340
Why are you so pathetic?

1687
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:34,140
Guys, why is he so pathetic, guys?

1688
01:23:34,820 --> 01:23:37,920
And he starts the sentence with I want your meat.

1689
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:41,860
Huh?

1690
01:23:58,860 --> 01:24:00,780
Okay, I shouldn't be that mean.

1691
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:13,920
What do you mean?

1692
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:15,700
What do you mean?

1693
01:24:15,700 --> 01:24:18,380
You are not making this more attractive, sir.

1694
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:24,040
Ah,

1695
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:27,520
yes.

1696
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:29,540
Me defeating Lu Bu.

1697
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:31,940
So not standing out.

1698
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:39,160
What?

1699
01:24:43,940 --> 01:24:46,940
This is like such a backhanded compliment.

1700
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:49,000
Thank you for the super chat.

1701
01:24:49,060 --> 01:24:49,720
Thank you, thank you.

1702
01:24:49,820 --> 01:24:52,260
The tall people are in the way of your BL.

1703
01:24:52,820 --> 01:24:53,700
Thank you for the super chat.

1704
01:24:53,780 --> 01:24:54,700
Thank you, thank you.

1705
01:24:55,180 --> 01:24:57,480
I understand how you feel.

1706
01:24:57,480 --> 01:25:00,640
So now you can eat and drink to your heart's content.

1707
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:04,880
If I treat you to that, it'll be hard to turn me down, right?

1708
01:25:05,020 --> 01:25:06,220
Is that how it goes?

1709
01:25:06,820 --> 01:25:09,140
I'll really be counting on you once you're ready.

1710
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:13,440
Since I believe you understand what's required.

1711
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:16,280
You are girl failure, he is guy failure.

1712
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:19,080
You two are perfect for each other.

1713
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:24,700
Oh no, our bond is stronger now.

1714
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:28,100
Attack this as well to become the strongest boss.

1715
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:30,660
Someday soon, you'll be the pillar of Wu.

1716
01:25:31,820 --> 01:25:32,100
Alright.

1717
01:25:33,180 --> 01:25:33,820
Let's leave.

1718
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:36,560
Alright, let's see.

1719
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:37,660
Life swipe!

1720
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:39,300
Thank you for your very first super chat.

1721
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:40,500
Thank you, thank you.

1722
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:44,000
Hong Dang, are you and Lu Bu still together?

1723
01:25:45,660 --> 01:25:46,740
He's like...

1724
01:25:46,740 --> 01:25:48,560
He's just like, this is it.

1725
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:50,440
This is my time to shine.

1726
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:51,060
Jeez.

1727
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:56,400
Alright, do I get any...

1728
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:57,520
Do I have any extra?

1729
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:58,740
No, I still haven't.

1730
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:00,620
Okay, uh, interactions.

1731
01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:04,320
Um...

1732
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:05,760
Okay, Chen Pu.

1733
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:06,850
Okay, let's see like...

1734
01:26:07,220 --> 01:26:07,820
Give me a sec.

1735
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:09,020
Let me see what I have to complete.

1736
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:11,040
I don't know if I want to pay for this one.

1737
01:26:12,060 --> 01:26:14,240
He's not like that important in my scale.

1738
01:26:16,060 --> 01:26:18,140
Or strong attack using a...

1739
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:20,100
Oh my god, fucking hell.

1740
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:24,200
Finish with enhanced final blow using...

1741
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:25,560
Oh my god.

1742
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:27,240
Okay, yeah, we're paying for it.

1743
01:26:27,460 --> 01:26:32,640
We're paying for it.

1744
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:32,980
Yeah.

1745
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:34,420
Oh, I broke.

1746
01:26:34,540 --> 01:26:34,900
Never mind.

1747
01:26:34,980 --> 01:26:35,920
I'll pay for it later.

1748
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:38,340
I'll pay for it later, guys.

1749
01:26:41,260 --> 01:26:42,300
Okay, uh...

1750
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:43,880
We need to find Chen Pu.

1751
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:46,220
He wants to start something with me.

1752
01:26:47,180 --> 01:26:48,520
It's somewhere here.

1753
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:55,400
Uh...

1754
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:56,000
Where the fuck?

1755
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:00,360
Where is it?

1756
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:01,380
Oh, there he is.

1757
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:01,800
Never mind.

1758
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:02,400
I found him.

1759
01:27:04,220 --> 01:27:04,340
Hello.

1760
01:27:09,220 --> 01:27:09,700
You...

1761
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:11,080
You asked for me!

1762
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:14,360
I literally rode a boat just to talk...

1763
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:16,720
I rode a boat for one month just to talk to you.

1764
01:27:16,780 --> 01:27:18,280
That was a long ship ride.

1765
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:22,380
The loss of Lord Sun Jian has thrown the house as soon into turmoil.

1766
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:25,940
To escape this mire, we need as many talented people as we can get.

1767
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:29,220
I can see your potential, so I offer you this.

1768
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:30,440
Hone your skills.

1769
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:34,640
I am sure that one day, you will be indispensable to this clan.

1770
01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:36,040
Okay, nice.

1771
01:27:36,180 --> 01:27:36,420
Okay.

1772
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:37,600
More training.

1773
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:42,360
Alright, now we gotta do the last Lu Bei mission.

1774
01:27:42,860 --> 01:27:43,500
Should be here.

1775
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:45,100
I'm gonna use the bathroom real quick.

1776
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:46,020
I'll be right back, guys.

1777
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:48,120
This has been the most fights we've ever gotten.

1778
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:49,320
I'm not gonna lie.

1779
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:55,000
Actually, it's been the most actual gameplay we've gotten today.

1780
01:27:55,900 --> 01:27:58,000
I've already romanced all the generals.

1781
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:03,740
And I'm back!

1782
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,180
I'm back, everybody.

1783
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:07,260
Where is this?

1784
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:08,360
Alright, there we go.

1785
01:29:08,540 --> 01:29:10,740
Battle of Bei Hai.

1786
01:29:11,060 --> 01:29:12,520
Oh, I'm like two levels above.

1787
01:29:12,620 --> 01:29:13,500
It should be fine.

1788
01:29:14,620 --> 01:29:16,300
Marsha, thank you for the superchat.

1789
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:17,280
Thank you, thank you.

1790
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:21,760
So you can't refuse if we buy you dinner first.

1791
01:29:22,140 --> 01:29:23,400
Thank you for the superchat.

1792
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:24,460
Thank you, thank you.

1793
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:26,800
Alan, Duck, Mike, Solid.

1794
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:27,760
Thank you for the superchat.

1795
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:28,660
Thank you, thank you.

1796
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:31,160
Hello, I'm here.

1797
01:29:31,620 --> 01:29:32,000
Lu Bei.

1798
01:29:32,780 --> 01:29:33,880
We're now in Bei Hai.

1799
01:29:34,060 --> 01:29:36,660
Our co-assistant governor, Lord Kong Rong.

1800
01:29:37,580 --> 01:29:41,960
According to Lord Tai Shi Si, his castle is being besieged by the remnants of the Yellow Turban.

1801
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:43,760
Okay, there he is.

1802
01:29:44,060 --> 01:29:52,140
We cannot let Kong Rong Lord Kong Rong Lord Kong Rong fall to their blades in the meantime.

1803
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:54,460
Our priority is keeping him safe.

1804
01:29:54,780 --> 01:29:57,880
There are reports of siege weapons among the enemy formation.

1805
01:29:58,360 --> 01:30:00,920
I would recommend keeping an eye on the castle gates.

1806
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:03,980
And we gotta make sure Lu Bei survives.

1807
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:08,420
Of course, same with Tai Shi Si who will be guiding us on the field.

1808
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:09,520
But he's blue.

1809
01:30:09,860 --> 01:30:11,240
He's a blue guy.

1810
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:13,280
Why are we letting him in here?

1811
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:16,480
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

1812
01:30:16,540 --> 01:30:17,400
Thank you, thank you.

1813
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:18,940
Just got my gamer subs already.

1814
01:30:19,140 --> 01:30:23,540
Oh yeah, a lot of people don't keep What?

1815
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:26,420
He's part of blue team.

1816
01:30:27,620 --> 01:30:31,880
How dare we let a blue man in here fighting with the greens.

1817
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:33,840
Let's go.

1818
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:35,500
It's cool, sparkly cup and t-shirt.

1819
01:30:35,620 --> 01:30:36,620
Ah, thank you for the super chat.

1820
01:30:36,700 --> 01:30:37,600
Thank you, thank you.

1821
01:30:37,780 --> 01:30:41,260
I'm glad that all the gamer subs stuff is starting to come... arrive.

1822
01:30:41,260 --> 01:30:42,660
I'm so happy about that.

1823
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:45,720
I actually got the t-shirt like a while ago.

1824
01:30:45,820 --> 01:30:47,640
I think like two months ago.

1825
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:51,140
But like obviously I'm getting them like...

1826
01:30:51,140 --> 01:30:58,120
I wanted to wear it, but then like two months ago but then I was just like, wait, no one else has it.

1827
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:09,460
Like, if I wear it in public If I wear it in public people will be like, wait a minute no one else has the shirt yet.

1828
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:14,340
So I thank god I stopped myself before it happened.

1829
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:20,080
There's much to keep in mind for this battle.

1830
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:21,160
Be sure to stay vigilant.

1831
01:31:33,260 --> 01:31:34,840
What should I do?

1832
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:43,160
With enough courage, we can stagger the enemy and break through their lines.

1833
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:49,480
Once we reach the castle, our position will be assured, and we need only finish off the remaining enemies.

1834
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:53,020
As always, it's a rough sort of plan, but I like it.

1835
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:55,260
I'm grateful you answered its call.

1836
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:57,500
I too will give you my all in the next battle.

1837
01:31:57,680 --> 01:31:58,220
Good luck.

1838
01:31:58,980 --> 01:31:59,380
Nice.

1839
01:31:59,540 --> 01:32:00,320
I have Guan Yun.

1840
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:01,400
Nice.

1841
01:32:03,260 --> 01:32:05,280
I do hope they make the next dynasty.

1842
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:13,620
I do enjoy this one, but I hope they make their next dynasty warriors I can play as the actual generals, because that's the more fun part.

1843
01:32:16,220 --> 01:32:23,200
I know they want to do my self-insert OC here, but like it's just not the same, you know?

1844
01:32:24,260 --> 01:32:29,620
Playing as your favorite generals in the Three Kingdoms, just not the same.

1845
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:32,440
Alright, nice.

1846
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:33,120
That was easy.

1847
01:32:35,740 --> 01:32:36,980
That's right, beg.

1848
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:39,980
That's fucked up.

1849
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:43,120
I'm helping him, but he's just gonna leave me anyway.

1850
01:32:44,620 --> 01:32:46,300
Get outta here.

1851
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:48,380
Get outta here!

1852
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:50,860
Oh shit, I need to look at what I need to do.

1853
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:53,580
Alright, perform Rage Mode.

1854
01:32:55,100 --> 01:32:57,860
Successful charge or ambush.

1855
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:01,940
Win five duels while being injured.

1856
01:33:02,780 --> 01:33:03,360
Defeat 200.

1857
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:04,500
Okay, I need to do the sword.

1858
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:05,680
I keep forgetting the sword.

1859
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:08,100
Foes of Ida.

1860
01:33:08,360 --> 01:33:09,340
The gauntlet.

1861
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:12,140
Okay, sword time.

1862
01:33:12,980 --> 01:33:14,000
Okay, where's my sword?

1863
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:14,860
Oh, I can't change it.

1864
01:33:14,900 --> 01:33:16,340
I was doing something really cool.

1865
01:33:17,060 --> 01:33:17,860
Okay, sword time.

1866
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:21,520
Oh, I should've bought the sword just cause like I have to do the sword shit.

1867
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:27,600
I should've bought the sword just for the sword mission.

1868
01:33:28,180 --> 01:33:28,840
Get over here.

1869
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:31,080
I need to do this mission.

1870
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:33,580
Get outta here!

1871
01:33:36,140 --> 01:33:36,740
Nice.

1872
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:38,200
Oh my god, that was fast.

1873
01:33:38,340 --> 01:33:38,840
Alright, nice.

1874
01:33:44,900 --> 01:33:47,440
Yeah, should we go out and die?

1875
01:33:51,020 --> 01:33:52,220
So boring!

1876
01:33:55,320 --> 01:33:55,920
Man!

1877
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:59,740
We should be out there dying!

1878
01:34:00,180 --> 01:34:01,440
Aw man!

1879
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:04,720
That's crazy.

1880
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:07,480
I would wanna be on lookout duty.

1881
01:34:07,580 --> 01:34:08,520
What the fuck?

1882
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:13,360
I can't believe he said that.

1883
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:14,580
That's crazy.

1884
01:34:16,100 --> 01:34:22,840
Like, I can't believe I had to go out there and like not potentially die?

1885
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:31,520
I should be out there risking my life to be cannon fodder.

1886
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:33,560
Okay.

1887
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:37,700
How?

1888
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:38,500
Where did he die?

1889
01:34:41,820 --> 01:34:43,140
Brave Karl Where?

1890
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:45,780

1899
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:09,540
I forgot I was the reinforcements coming in.

1900
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:11,740

1901
01:35:11,940 --> 01:35:15,320

Don't worry, I'm here to help.

1905

Since part one!

1912
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:58,560
How do I get third wheel like here?

1913

I can't believe it.

1921
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:21,920
I can't believe guardian would say that in front of me.

1922
01:36:22,100 --> 01:36:24,020
After everything we've been through.

1923
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:25,000
Look at this.

1924
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,620
Look at this compact guardian.

01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:28,200
Are you not entertained?

1926
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:30,360

Nothing sexier than the blood of my own enemy.

1935
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:58,520
That's what I'm saying!

1936
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:02,160

I'm sorry.

2000
01:39:57,940 --> 01:40:00,680
The ladder people took away a lot of my attention.

2001
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:03,120
Wait where is Lupe?

2002
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:05,920

Lupe don't worry!

2011
01:40:14,980 --> 01:40:15,340
Eat your bread!

Don't worry Lupe!

2013
01:40:17,300 --> 01:40:18,880
It's okay he ate his bread guys!

2014
01:40:21,140 --> 01:40:22,440
He ate his bread guys!

2015
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:22,860
It's okay!

2016
01:40:26,620 --> 01:40:27,320
Don't worry!

2017
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:28,720
I got- I came back in time!

2018
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:33,000
Don't worry guys!

2019
01:40:33,060 --> 01:40:33,840
I- I did it!

2020
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:39,780
Jesus Christ there's so many people here.

2021
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:42,800
Like where is the- Oh there he is!

2022
01:40:42,860 --> 01:40:45,500
There's so many people here I couldn't see where the general was.

2023
01:40:47,740 --> 01:40:48,860
That's fucking right!

2024
01:40:49,020 --> 01:40:49,680
Get out!

2025
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:52,540
I'm two levels higher!

2026
01:40:54,440 --> 01:40:54,640
You know what?

2027
01:40:54,680 --> 01:40:55,160
Fuck it.

2028
01:40:55,220 --> 01:40:56,620
Let's do extreme Musou time.

2029
01:40:57,780 --> 01:40:58,540
Let's go.

2030
01:40:58,880 --> 01:40:59,860
It's a little bit extreme.

2031
01:41:01,060 --> 01:41:02,020
Oh fuck!

2032
01:41:02,120 --> 01:41:02,860
Okay nice.

2033
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:06,840
Okay that might have been a little extreme though not gonna lie.

2034
01:41:07,980 --> 01:41:09,020
But it was worth it.

2035
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:09,860
Get out!

2036
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:15,520
Get out!

2037
01:41:16,580 --> 01:41:16,940
Nice.

2038
01:41:20,260 --> 01:41:21,260
Wait where?

2039
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:29,000
He's gonna secretly murder him.

2040
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:30,200
I can see it.

2041
01:41:31,120 --> 01:41:32,240
I can see it.

2042
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:37,440
I don't remember his part in history but like that's so sus.

2043
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:41,640
That's so sus.

2044
01:41:42,200 --> 01:41:43,280
That's so sus.

2045
01:41:43,400 --> 01:41:43,640
That's so suspicious.

2046
01:41:44,020 --> 01:41:46,000
I don't trust nobody here.

2047
01:41:47,240 --> 01:41:48,420
That's so suspicious!

2048
01:41:52,460 --> 01:41:54,760
Why does he really wanna go see him?

2049
01:41:57,200 --> 01:41:58,560
Okay nice.

2050
01:42:00,300 --> 01:42:01,500
That should be everybody right?

2051
01:42:02,580 --> 01:42:05,500
My god how is there still more?

2052
01:42:08,860 --> 01:42:09,960
Oh my god!

2053
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:10,540
Go back!

2054
01:42:11,320 --> 01:42:12,120
Okay give me a sec.

2055
01:42:12,200 --> 01:42:13,200
I'll go back.

2056
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:15,200
I'm gonna go back.

2057
01:42:16,040 --> 01:42:16,820
Don't worry!

2058
01:42:16,980 --> 01:42:18,040
Coming back!

2059
01:42:20,460 --> 01:42:21,600
Don't worry!

2060
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:24,160
I'm coming back I guess.

2061
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:25,680
Wait!

2062
01:42:38,180 --> 01:42:39,360
Oh my god!

2063
01:42:39,420 --> 01:42:40,780
He's actually loyal?

2064
01:42:47,780 --> 01:42:49,680
Oh my god!

2065
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:50,740
He loyal?

2066
01:42:52,060 --> 01:42:53,420
That's crazy!

2067
01:42:54,780 --> 01:42:56,520
In my Three Kingdoms era?

2068
01:42:58,220 --> 01:42:59,100
Oh my god guys.

2069
01:42:59,200 --> 01:43:01,960
It's very hard to find loyal men in the Three Kingdoms area.

2070
01:43:02,360 --> 01:43:05,060
Like someone that's not gonna betray?

2071
01:43:05,980 --> 01:43:07,260
That's crazy.

2072
01:43:09,260 --> 01:43:10,320
Unheard of.

2073
01:43:12,980 --> 01:43:14,260
Jesus Christ.

2074
01:43:14,420 --> 01:43:15,600
How am I still fighting?

2075
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:26,720
There's like one or two people that broke in.

2076
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:32,460
I like how he said that but like two people broke in already.

2077
01:43:32,460 --> 01:43:34,340
It's not my fault though guys.

2078
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:35,500
I tried my best.

2079
01:43:37,380 --> 01:43:39,820
Guys, it's not my fault that they broke in, okay?

2080
01:43:40,520 --> 01:43:42,360
Like, I'm just one guy.

2081
01:43:46,160 --> 01:43:47,280
Alright, here we go.

2082
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:53,860
If he's so honorable, why he fucking work with Cao Cao, huh?

2083
01:43:57,140 --> 01:43:57,920
That's right.

2084
01:43:59,080 --> 01:44:04,600
To be fair, I never cared about, I never cared about Tai Chi because I never, I didn't like his design.

2085
01:44:04,720 --> 01:44:06,440
It wasn't...

2086
01:44:08,240 --> 01:44:08,820
Look.

2087
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:10,420
Look.

2088
01:44:10,420 --> 01:44:19,880
Look, all I'm saying was that younger me younger me was like was only interested on the people that

2089
01:44:23,540 --> 01:44:24,120
uh...

2090
01:44:24,120 --> 01:44:26,640
Wait, did I mistook Tai Chi with Zhu Hong?

2091
01:44:26,820 --> 01:44:27,340
Did I?

2092
01:44:27,340 --> 01:44:29,100
Wait, wasn't he with Wu?

2093
01:44:29,200 --> 01:44:29,980
Wasn't he blue?

2094
01:44:30,440 --> 01:44:31,180
Or was he green?

2095
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:32,280
I don't remember.

2096
01:44:32,500 --> 01:44:33,780
Oh my god!

2097
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:37,380
They're running to kill him!

2098
01:44:37,860 --> 01:44:38,980
Shit, where's the ladder?

2099
01:44:41,540 --> 01:44:42,660
Oh, he's red!

2100
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:43,460
Oh my god.

2101
01:44:43,940 --> 01:44:45,840
Okay, wait, how did he get to red?

2102
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:50,260
Okay guys, I need to go save him.

2103
01:44:50,680 --> 01:44:52,180
He was red all along?

2104
01:44:53,800 --> 01:44:58,460
Okay, his design was so uninteresting that I didn't even remember which faction he joined.

2105
01:44:58,780 --> 01:44:59,560
That was how...

2106
01:45:00,910 --> 01:45:03,540
That was how uninteresting he was to me.

2107
01:45:07,880 --> 01:45:11,200
That's how I like don't even remember what faction he was in.

2108
01:45:13,300 --> 01:45:14,880
He was red all along.

2109
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:19,280
I didn't even realize he was red all... Where is this guy?

2110
01:45:21,180 --> 01:45:23,100
Oh my god, where...

2111
01:45:23,100 --> 01:45:24,460
Oh, there he is.

2112
01:45:24,460 --> 01:45:26,640
Oh, you guys were like 1 HP.

2113
01:45:26,820 --> 01:45:28,220
How the fuck did you break in?

2114
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:43,560
What?

2115
01:45:57,650 --> 01:45:58,290
Manny!

2116
01:46:02,150 --> 01:46:03,990
I didn't...

2117
01:46:03,990 --> 01:46:06,210
Are you fucking serious?

2118
01:46:07,950 --> 01:46:08,870
Where?

2119
01:46:10,930 --> 01:46:11,850
Where?

2120
01:46:12,650 --> 01:46:13,750
Which is sub?

2121
01:46:14,030 --> 01:46:15,490
Which is... Which gate?

2122
01:46:16,210 --> 01:46:17,330
Is it this gate?

2123
01:46:19,450 --> 01:46:21,550
Oh my god.

2124
01:46:23,670 --> 01:46:25,970
Which gate was it?

2125
01:46:27,230 --> 01:46:28,490
Was it this one?

2126
01:46:30,410 --> 01:46:32,290
Oh my god.

2127
01:46:33,450 --> 01:46:34,590
Okay, okay.

2128
01:46:34,750 --> 01:46:38,250
Okay, we won't deal with the people inside, I guess.

2129
01:46:39,130 --> 01:46:39,850
That's fine.

2130
01:46:41,610 --> 01:46:46,130
But yeah, I never cared much about his design, because it was never...

2131
01:46:46,130 --> 01:46:47,610
It wasn't that interesting to me.

2132
01:46:50,610 --> 01:46:53,850
Okay, let's deal with this real quick, I guess.

2133
01:46:54,490 --> 01:46:55,850
I don't know.

2134
01:46:58,490 --> 01:47:00,170
I didn't think you would...

2135
01:47:00,170 --> 01:47:01,890
I didn't think it would happen!

2136
01:47:07,330 --> 01:47:07,850
Okay.

2137
01:47:11,110 --> 01:47:15,190
Alright, we're just killing this guy real quick, and then I'll help out with the rest.

2138
01:47:17,250 --> 01:47:18,610
Don't worry, I'm...

2139
01:47:19,290 --> 01:47:19,510
What?

2140
01:47:19,770 --> 01:47:19,990
Where?

2141
01:47:20,190 --> 01:47:20,450
Where?

2142
01:47:20,830 --> 01:47:21,730
Where is he?

2143
01:47:23,330 --> 01:47:23,850
Okay.

2144
01:47:25,290 --> 01:47:26,070
Okay.

2145
01:47:26,070 --> 01:47:30,150
I... I'm trying not... I'm trying my best!

2146
01:47:30,230 --> 01:47:31,450
There's so many forces!

2147
01:47:32,290 --> 01:47:33,850
How did they all break in?!

2148
01:47:37,470 --> 01:47:38,250
Okay.

2149
01:47:40,270 --> 01:47:40,590
Okay.

2150
01:47:41,930 --> 01:47:42,550
Done.

2151
01:47:42,650 --> 01:47:42,910
Alright.

2152
01:47:43,330 --> 01:47:44,290
We got this guy.

2153
01:47:47,250 --> 01:47:47,870
Alright.

2154
01:47:49,730 --> 01:47:50,160
Alright.

2155
01:47:51,490 --> 01:47:52,230
That's fine.

2156
01:47:54,490 --> 01:47:55,730
That's fine!

2157
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:00,450
It's okay!

2158
01:48:02,170 --> 01:48:02,930
I believe!

2159
01:48:07,970 --> 01:48:11,750
I can't believe they just climbed the ladder like that!

2160
01:48:12,690 --> 01:48:13,790
It's just two men!

2161
01:48:16,310 --> 01:48:17,930
Oh my god, we gotta get him out of here!

2162
01:48:20,150 --> 01:48:21,230
Oh please, PC!

2163
01:48:21,370 --> 01:48:21,590
Peace!

2164
01:48:21,890 --> 01:48:23,070
Please, please, please live!

2165
01:48:23,330 --> 01:48:24,030
Please live!

2166
01:48:25,330 --> 01:48:26,790
Please fucking live!

2167
01:48:28,550 --> 01:48:30,970
I wanna prove that I'm a true warrior!

2168
01:48:35,090 --> 01:48:36,390
Oh my god, please!

2169
01:48:36,910 --> 01:48:39,690
Oh my god, I have to make sure everybody is alive!

2170
01:48:39,690 --> 01:48:40,010
Oh my god!

2171
01:48:41,970 --> 01:48:42,730
Okay.

2172
01:48:43,210 --> 01:48:43,910
Arrow time.

2173
01:48:44,530 --> 01:48:45,650
Do it, dragons!

2174
01:48:46,030 --> 01:48:46,710
For Toki!

2175
01:48:49,350 --> 01:48:50,930
Shoot your arrows!

2176
01:48:53,070 --> 01:48:54,210
This is serious.

2177
01:48:55,550 --> 01:48:56,310
Ooh.

2178
01:48:57,410 --> 01:48:58,190
Who challenged me?

2179
01:48:59,290 --> 01:49:00,030
Who was it?

2180
01:49:01,990 --> 01:49:03,210
Who was it?

2181
01:49:03,810 --> 01:49:04,770
Okay, it's too late.

2182
01:49:06,970 --> 01:49:08,010
It's too late.

2183
01:49:08,010 --> 01:49:13,070
Look, I would have loved to challenge you, but like, you're too late, son.

2184
01:49:14,290 --> 01:49:15,250
You're a little too late.

2185
01:49:16,470 --> 01:49:17,090
Okay, nice.

2186
01:49:17,630 --> 01:49:22,510
Okay, we kill this guy, and then, oh my god!

2187
01:49:22,930 --> 01:49:24,310
Oh my god!

2188
01:49:24,390 --> 01:49:24,670
Okay.

2189
01:49:25,470 --> 01:49:26,970
Please, just let me kill him!

2190
01:49:27,170 --> 01:49:30,470
Please, just live a little longer!

2191
01:49:30,730 --> 01:49:32,370
Please, I need to kill him!

2192
01:49:32,370 --> 01:49:33,970
Okay, okay, I'm coming back!

2193
01:49:34,190 --> 01:49:34,750
I'm coming over!

2194
01:49:35,610 --> 01:49:37,230
Oh my god!

2195
01:49:38,090 --> 01:49:39,650
Oh my god!

2196
01:49:39,770 --> 01:49:41,810
Please, don't die!

2197
01:49:42,130 --> 01:49:44,090
You're literally the only Genoa left!

2198
01:49:44,690 --> 01:49:46,210
Please, I'm heading over!

2199
01:49:46,350 --> 01:49:47,070
Please don't die!

2200
01:49:47,390 --> 01:49:49,850
Please, ICG, please don't die!

2201
01:49:50,110 --> 01:49:51,030
Please don't die!

2202
01:49:51,310 --> 01:49:52,310
Okay, okay!

2203
01:49:53,690 --> 01:49:54,290
Alright,

2204
01:50:00,190 --> 01:50:00,630
there we go.

2205
01:50:00,630 --> 01:50:01,190
It's fine.

2206
01:50:05,410 --> 01:50:06,410
It's okay!

2207
01:50:07,310 --> 01:50:08,330
We're okay!

2208
01:50:08,710 --> 01:50:09,870
We're okay!

2209
01:50:11,570 --> 01:50:12,370
Guanyin's here!

2210
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:17,420
Guanyin's here, it's okay!

2211
01:50:18,640 --> 01:50:19,680
Let's go!

2212
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:22,680
This is a very important fight!

2213
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:27,420
Holy shit!

2214
01:50:28,120 --> 01:50:29,480
Yo, what the fuck?

2215
01:50:29,480 --> 01:50:31,480
What's going on?!

2216
01:50:33,660 --> 01:50:35,020
Jesus Christ!

2217
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:35,840
Okay!

2218
01:50:37,320 --> 01:50:38,620
Okay, let's do that again!

2219
01:50:39,020 --> 01:50:42,220
Yeah, that's not broken at all, guys!

2220
01:50:43,580 --> 01:50:44,260
Boom!

2221
01:50:47,100 --> 01:50:49,380
Where did he- oh, we did it!

2222
01:50:54,020 --> 01:50:56,140
Behold, the god of war!

2223
01:50:56,480 --> 01:50:57,560
I did it, guys!

2224
01:50:57,560 --> 01:50:59,180
All of me!

2225
01:50:59,940 --> 01:51:03,160
Random self-insert man did all of that!

2226
01:51:07,780 --> 01:51:08,620
Yippee!

2227
01:51:09,140 --> 01:51:10,780
They're finally gone for real!

2228
01:51:10,860 --> 01:51:12,360
Just Guanyin!

2229
01:51:16,380 --> 01:51:20,560
But yeah, I never- I don't say I don't like Taishi.

2230
01:51:21,220 --> 01:51:24,800
I just never acknowledge his existence.

2231
01:51:26,280 --> 01:51:32,220
After one, perform this move just as your cover wheel increases the number of wheels being- Oh wait, I wanna do that!

2232
01:51:32,960 --> 01:51:34,800
That sounds fucking sick!

2233
01:51:37,160 --> 01:51:39,560
Guanyin casually creates a black hole.

2234
01:51:40,620 --> 01:51:42,180
Loki is our Oshi.

2235
01:51:47,850 --> 01:51:50,510
Increase this amount of stability plus four- Yay!

2236
01:51:51,190 --> 01:51:52,910
Oh my god, look at everything I completed!

2237
01:51:55,610 --> 01:51:56,290
Nice.

2238
01:51:56,830 --> 01:51:58,570
I'm braver now.

2239
01:51:59,630 --> 01:52:01,990
Let's get- Oh, I don't have anything else.

2240
01:52:03,790 --> 01:52:05,190
Just Guanyin things, yeah.

2241
01:52:14,330 --> 01:52:15,690
I did it, guys!

2242
01:52:16,110 --> 01:52:16,750
All of me!

2243
01:52:22,230 --> 01:52:24,850
Why is he wearing blue?

2244
01:52:26,570 --> 01:52:28,110
Is he gonna be red?

2245
01:52:32,890 --> 01:52:33,610
What?

2246
01:52:41,610 --> 01:52:42,330
What?

2247
01:52:43,730 --> 01:52:43,950
Forcefully?

2248
01:52:44,250 --> 01:52:47,730
How would I fight with determination if I was forced to do it?

2249
01:52:52,770 --> 01:52:56,010
Is that purple?

2250
01:52:56,870 --> 01:52:58,090
It looks blue.

2251
01:53:14,670 --> 01:53:15,190
Yeah.

2252
01:53:15,270 --> 01:53:16,370
Yeah, after everything you did.

2253
01:53:52,060 --> 01:53:52,700
What?

2254
01:53:52,700 --> 01:53:53,520
Alright, nice.

2255
01:53:53,720 --> 01:53:54,700
We did it.

2256
01:53:57,680 --> 01:53:58,320
What?

2257
01:53:58,320 --> 01:53:59,480
You and Shao?

2258
01:53:59,540 --> 01:54:01,620
The fuck was I doing with you and Shao?

2259
01:54:10,070 --> 01:54:12,090
Nobody knows how to pronounce Conrong's name, right?

2260
01:54:12,430 --> 01:54:13,270
I don't either.

2261
01:54:17,810 --> 01:54:19,710
Which was like yesterday.

2262
01:54:23,730 --> 01:54:26,170
Guys, good to see you.

2263
01:54:27,410 --> 01:54:28,450
I'm so popular.

2264
01:54:40,150 --> 01:54:42,690
I hope we can fight together again someday.

2265
01:54:44,050 --> 01:54:46,010
But I wonder when that will be.

2266
01:54:47,370 --> 01:54:49,470
I serve Lord Liu Yao now.

2267
01:54:50,050 --> 01:54:52,210
But it seems he does not trust me.

2268
01:54:52,870 --> 01:54:52,870
What?

2269
01:54:53,090 --> 01:54:54,070
You look so trustable.

2270
01:54:56,450 --> 01:54:59,050
If only he knew you're- Yeah, I'm sliding in.

2271
01:54:59,370 --> 01:55:01,990
I'm glad to hear that you deem my skills adequate.

2272
01:55:03,290 --> 01:55:07,070
But it is only natural to deny a newcomer's important tasks.

2273
01:55:07,070 --> 01:55:09,730
I do not fault Lord Liu Yao's judgment.

2274
01:55:10,990 --> 01:55:13,350
I have made somewhat of a name for myself on the battlefield.

2275
01:55:14,070 --> 01:55:16,350
But I have yet to accomplish anything in his service.

2276
01:55:17,030 --> 01:55:20,250
You will have to earn his respect, little by little.

2277
01:55:21,030 --> 01:55:24,270
Eventually, he will trust me with more important tasks.

2278
01:55:24,890 --> 01:55:26,610
And I will be rewarded accordingly.

2279
01:55:28,210 --> 01:55:30,010
That is what I believe.

2280
01:55:35,690 --> 01:55:37,550
The thought is more than enough.

2281
01:55:37,550 --> 01:55:40,150
I think it's worth a reward of its own.

2282
01:55:41,890 --> 01:55:42,610
That's it.

2283
01:55:42,670 --> 01:55:44,210
I am just the thing.

2284
01:55:45,290 --> 01:55:46,810
I have finished my tasks for today.

2285
01:55:47,310 --> 01:55:48,750
What will you give to my team?

2286
01:55:49,970 --> 01:55:51,950
To pay for everything for all that you've done.

2287
01:55:52,310 --> 01:55:53,550
Let this one be on me.

2288
01:55:56,410 --> 01:55:57,670
Then it's settled.

2289
01:55:58,270 --> 01:56:02,530
Don't let me catch you holding back just because- Now?

2290
01:56:03,310 --> 01:56:05,630
Have some food.

2291
01:56:07,550 --> 01:56:09,930
Why do all the generals just treat me out for food?

2292
01:56:10,090 --> 01:56:11,690
Like, there's other stuff to do.

2293
01:56:11,770 --> 01:56:15,530
Isn't there not- Is there not anything else to do in ancient China?

2294
01:56:18,810 --> 01:56:19,230
Like...

2295
01:56:19,230 --> 01:56:21,510
Being with you gives me strength, not doki.

2296
01:56:22,650 --> 01:56:26,350
I'm lucky to have a friend like you of whom I can speak in such a carefree manner.

2297
01:56:26,530 --> 01:56:27,050
Ah, yes.

2298
01:56:27,630 --> 01:56:28,050
Friend.

2299
01:56:29,590 --> 01:56:31,410
Let's continue to better ourselves.

2300
01:56:31,570 --> 01:56:33,650
So that we can live through this chaotic time.

2301
01:56:34,690 --> 01:56:35,850
I don't understand.

2302
01:56:36,270 --> 01:56:39,150
Why is it all just- It's always food!

2303
01:56:42,670 --> 01:56:45,010
Why can't it be anything else?

2304
01:56:47,430 --> 01:56:49,330
Okay, I want to do the...

2305
01:56:49,330 --> 01:56:50,430
Uh, okay.

2306
01:56:50,950 --> 01:56:52,650
This one cancels it.

2307
01:56:53,510 --> 01:56:55,890
This one does the- What was the one that was super cool?

2308
01:56:55,910 --> 01:56:56,370
Oh, this one.

2309
01:56:56,450 --> 01:56:57,330
Flying Spirit Wave.

2310
01:56:57,390 --> 01:56:57,930
There we go.

2311
01:56:58,450 --> 01:56:59,750
That's the one I wanted to do.

2312
01:56:59,890 --> 01:57:00,910
That one looked cool.

2313
01:57:01,490 --> 01:57:03,290
That one looked cool as hell.

2314
01:57:06,780 --> 01:57:07,260
Okay.

2315
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,780
It's always food.

2316
01:57:11,700 --> 01:57:13,160
More than just food.

2317
01:57:16,580 --> 01:57:17,540
Is this a village?

2318
01:57:17,680 --> 01:57:18,660
Okay, there's the village.

2319
01:57:19,660 --> 01:57:21,100
I want to go here to see.

2320
01:57:21,940 --> 01:57:25,220
The way to a man's heart is through his stomach.

2321
01:57:25,680 --> 01:57:27,000
Duck, thank you for the super chat.

2322
01:57:27,140 --> 01:57:28,060
Thank you, thank you.

2323
01:57:28,060 --> 01:57:28,260
Thank you.

2324
01:57:31,320 --> 01:57:32,300
Let's see.

2325
01:57:33,100 --> 01:57:35,280
What is...

2326
01:57:35,970 --> 01:57:36,280
Interactions.

2327
01:57:37,770 --> 01:57:39,880
Uh, yeah, I'll pay for this one.

2328
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:42,840
Dianwei Yang Province.

2329
01:57:43,080 --> 01:57:43,340
Alright.

2330
01:57:44,380 --> 01:57:46,220
Time to do our favorite, guys.

2331
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:50,060
It's time to visit...

2332
01:57:50,620 --> 01:57:52,420
Dianwei, wherever he is.

2333
01:57:52,940 --> 01:57:54,000
Where the fuck does he live?

2334
01:57:54,040 --> 01:57:54,720
Oh, it's right here.

2335
01:57:58,580 --> 01:57:59,760
Oh, there he is.

2336
01:58:02,700 --> 01:58:02,860
Hello.

2337
01:58:04,860 --> 01:58:06,640
I totally authentically created...

2338
01:58:07,200 --> 01:58:08,600
Completed your training, sir.

2339
01:58:11,750 --> 01:58:14,690
I swear to god, if he's gonna invite me to food again.

2340
01:58:24,560 --> 01:58:25,960
What are you doing?

2341
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:33,520
Oh.

2342
01:58:39,140 --> 01:58:40,140
That's me.

2343
01:58:50,760 --> 01:58:52,100
Yes, southern.

2344
01:58:54,600 --> 01:58:57,600
He got a southern accent in ancient China.

2345
01:59:00,160 --> 01:59:02,320
I am the same as those yellow turbans.

2346
01:59:03,020 --> 01:59:08,380
Lord Cao Cao ignored my past, took me in, and gave me his trust.

2347
01:59:09,860 --> 01:59:10,500
He...

2348
01:59:10,500 --> 01:59:15,220
He was on a boat to the New World.

2349
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:19,480
Dianwei was on that boat to the New World and founded Texas.

2350
01:59:22,520 --> 01:59:24,300
China is huge, okay?

2351
01:59:26,600 --> 01:59:30,120
He was patient zero of Texas.

2352
01:59:37,450 --> 01:59:41,230
What the fuck are you shopping for?

2353
01:59:41,870 --> 01:59:42,670
That you...

2354
01:59:42,670 --> 01:59:46,410
What are we buying?

2355
01:59:48,610 --> 01:59:48,970
Pots?

2356
01:59:55,090 --> 01:59:56,770
The first Texan.

2357
01:59:57,670 --> 01:59:59,530
Oh my god, it's always food!

2358
02:00:03,110 --> 02:00:04,490
A bite, you say?

2359
02:00:12,370 --> 02:00:15,390
Oh yeah, no, he's definitely in it for the brisket.

2360
02:00:24,510 --> 02:00:25,710
Alright, nice.

2361
02:00:26,990 --> 02:00:28,710
My bond with him grows stronger.

2362
02:00:30,630 --> 02:00:31,970
Where's the village?

2363
02:00:33,230 --> 02:00:34,690
Where the fuck...

2364
02:00:34,690 --> 02:00:35,210
Oh, it's here.

2365
02:00:36,170 --> 02:00:37,750
It's like... here?

2366
02:00:39,750 --> 02:00:40,870
Oh, here.

2367
02:00:41,270 --> 02:00:43,270
Oh, it's like my...

2368
02:00:43,270 --> 02:00:46,090
my secret area.

2369
02:00:49,640 --> 02:00:51,440
My little secret hidey hole.

2370
02:00:54,460 --> 02:00:59,760
Alright, my personal doctor that does not pay for rent at all and lives with me.

2371
02:00:59,760 --> 02:01:01,140
What do you think?

2372
02:01:11,300 --> 02:01:11,680
What?

2373
02:01:21,860 --> 02:01:25,940
Yeah, watch this.

2374
02:01:28,700 --> 02:01:30,000
I did it.

2375
02:01:33,320 --> 02:01:35,340
That's not me, right?

2376
02:01:36,680 --> 02:01:37,940
I didn't do it.

2377
02:01:40,320 --> 02:01:40,800
Hehehe.

2378
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:50,060
No, no, I'm a casual.

2379
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:57,480
Wait,

2380
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:02,480
oh wait, he was a real person?

2381
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:08,200
Oh my god, he was real this entire time?

2382
02:02:13,460 --> 02:02:14,460
Oh my god.

2383
02:02:14,520 --> 02:02:15,600
Oh my god, he actually has a name.

2384
02:02:15,780 --> 02:02:17,680
Bai... who the fuck is Bai Luan?

2385
02:02:34,920 --> 02:02:36,600
I'm an outsider.

2386
02:02:39,920 --> 02:02:41,300
Wait, are they dead?

2387
02:02:43,080 --> 02:02:44,940
Oh my god, I'm...

2388
02:02:44,940 --> 02:02:45,880
I'm from the Creed.

2389
02:02:49,340 --> 02:02:51,300
This is my Assassin's Creed, guys.

2390
02:02:51,620 --> 02:02:54,100
I'm literally from... I'm literally...

2391
02:02:54,100 --> 02:02:56,000
My ancestor, Altair.

2392
02:03:04,300 --> 02:03:06,820
This was Assassin's Creed all along.

2393
02:03:15,320 --> 02:03:16,080
What?

2394
02:03:24,380 --> 02:03:25,740
He's a chief?

2395
02:03:26,220 --> 02:03:27,120
He's 10!

2396
02:03:27,940 --> 02:03:29,780
Who gave this 10 year old power?

2397
02:03:30,700 --> 02:03:31,640
He's not the emperor.

2398
02:03:31,640 --> 02:03:32,600
Hahahaha.

2399
02:03:36,780 --> 02:03:38,600
He's not the fucking emperor.

2400
02:03:42,940 --> 02:03:43,580
Damn,

2401
02:03:53,340 --> 02:03:54,540
I can't believe it.

2402
02:03:55,760 --> 02:03:58,600
They saw the emperor was 10 years old so they did the same thing.

2403
02:04:07,450 --> 02:04:08,910
I just saw...

2404
02:04:11,670 --> 02:04:12,170
What the fuck?

2405
02:04:12,950 --> 02:04:14,950
Oh my... my controller doesn't work.

2406
02:04:15,550 --> 02:04:16,250
What the fuck?

2407
02:04:16,450 --> 02:04:18,630
My controller stopped working.

2408
02:04:33,510 --> 02:04:36,570
Oh, I was just getting...

2409
02:04:36,570 --> 02:04:39,310
I was just getting herb incensed up again.

2410
02:04:44,250 --> 02:04:47,910
So all I have to do is just get incensed up.

2411
02:04:52,530 --> 02:04:54,030
A scent of an herb?

2412
02:04:57,770 --> 02:04:58,510
Oh no.

2413
02:05:01,310 --> 02:05:02,610
Oh my god.

2414
02:05:03,230 --> 02:05:07,470
So how do I know if my visions are real or if I'm just really, really high?

2415
02:05:13,510 --> 02:05:13,890
What?

2416
02:05:18,670 --> 02:05:21,250
It's the tinkers of herbs.

2417
02:05:21,390 --> 02:05:22,830
Is that what you're saying?

2418
02:05:30,010 --> 02:05:37,730
I can't believe it.

2419
02:05:37,930 --> 02:05:42,650
The doctor wants me to get the doctor wants me to get even more herbed up.

2420
02:05:43,430 --> 02:05:44,270
What's that?

2421
02:05:46,830 --> 02:05:48,390
Oh my god, my controller is back.

2422
02:05:48,470 --> 02:05:49,510
Okay guys, I fixed it.

2423
02:05:50,210 --> 02:05:51,090
I fixed my controller.

2424
02:05:53,470 --> 02:05:54,550
I need 50.

2425
02:05:54,650 --> 02:05:55,430
I don't have that.

2426
02:05:58,380 --> 02:06:00,740
What even is my bravery gauge?

2427
02:06:03,380 --> 02:06:05,020
Is that my battle arts?

2428
02:06:12,540 --> 02:06:14,100
Yeah, is that my battle arts?

2429
02:06:14,240 --> 02:06:14,480
Yeah.

2430
02:06:23,440 --> 02:06:25,740
You were raised?

2431
02:06:25,860 --> 02:06:27,220
Why was he so short?

2432
02:06:27,560 --> 02:06:29,320
He was shorter than me.

2433
02:06:34,360 --> 02:06:36,120
Wait, Faya is the same age as me?

2434
02:06:42,200 --> 02:06:43,300
Who taught you?

2435
02:06:49,200 --> 02:06:51,240
The true short king.

2436
02:06:51,400 --> 02:06:52,880
That's why he's still a chief.

2437
02:07:21,860 --> 02:07:23,600
I killed a lot of people.

2438
02:07:24,880 --> 02:07:26,400
I don't know if you can live through that.

2439
02:07:27,520 --> 02:07:30,740
The only way I can get through the day is when you light up the incense.

2440
02:07:36,760 --> 02:07:37,160
See?

2441
02:07:42,450 --> 02:07:44,710
Oh, you wanna talk?

2442
02:07:44,810 --> 02:07:46,570
We just- We live together.

2443
02:07:54,290 --> 02:07:55,210
Um...

2444
02:08:05,490 --> 02:08:06,410
Oh,

2445
02:08:10,630 --> 02:08:12,170
I hope- Alright.

2446
02:08:12,630 --> 02:08:15,190
We're gonna test all- Okay.

2447
02:08:15,690 --> 02:08:17,970
Let's see what doesn't kill me.

2448
02:08:18,490 --> 02:08:20,910
The human experimentation tab.

2449
02:08:22,610 --> 02:08:26,910
I heard there's some rare specimens to be- We're gonna freestyle it, guys.

2450
02:08:27,610 --> 02:08:30,490
Let's just eat all the random mushrooms in the field.

2451
02:08:31,230 --> 02:08:33,730
To be found in Yang Province.

2452
02:08:34,150 --> 02:08:36,730
If you see any of your travels, can you bring them to me?

2453
02:08:39,390 --> 02:08:39,950
Okay.

2454
02:08:41,310 --> 02:08:42,710
I'm so excited.

2455
02:08:56,380 --> 02:08:57,100
Yeah.

2456
02:08:59,000 --> 02:08:59,340
Yeah.

2457
02:08:59,340 --> 02:08:59,340
Chance.

2458
02:08:59,700 --> 02:09:02,280
Not that I saw you sitting outside the building.

2459
02:09:06,940 --> 02:09:08,380
Of course.

2460
02:09:08,640 --> 02:09:09,600
Not really.

2461
02:09:12,980 --> 02:09:16,840
I have to eat random herbs that my personal doctor's gonna cook.

2462
02:09:17,220 --> 02:09:19,000
Who I think is actually a child.

2463
02:09:25,120 --> 02:09:26,780
You are no one.

2464
02:09:27,540 --> 02:09:28,920
So you can yet be someone.

2465
02:09:29,820 --> 02:09:33,940
You can be someone, and yet you are still no one.

2466
02:09:35,360 --> 02:09:36,360
The fuck?

2467
02:09:37,040 --> 02:09:43,320
Are you spe- Are you- Are you speaking in real?

2468
02:09:46,800 --> 02:09:48,860
As good a question as any.

2469
02:09:49,480 --> 02:09:54,140
What my words mean depends entirely on the choices before you.

2470
02:09:54,500 --> 02:09:58,440
What I'm saying will become clear eventually.

2471
02:09:59,300 --> 02:10:01,620
You'll get it sooner or later.

2472
02:10:02,500 --> 02:10:06,560
I'll have my eye on you to see how you progress, too.

2473
02:10:06,760 --> 02:10:09,060
The incense is hitting hard right now.

2474
02:10:09,240 --> 02:10:12,740
This ritual retreat is open for people like yourself, you know?

2475
02:10:15,420 --> 02:10:16,740
No, I don't know.

2476
02:10:17,320 --> 02:10:20,080
I don't- What the fuck was that interaction?

2477
02:10:20,080 --> 02:10:21,660
Okay, okay, he's assigning me a mission.

2478
02:10:21,780 --> 02:10:22,000
Okay.

2479
02:10:23,320 --> 02:10:24,640
Alright, let's see.

2480
02:10:24,880 --> 02:10:26,120
Dramatic success with a tactic.

2481
02:10:26,260 --> 02:10:30,820
Once achieved, activate tactics from a wheel recovery?

2482
02:10:32,680 --> 02:10:34,220
The fuck is wheel recovery?

2483
02:10:34,320 --> 02:10:36,260
Am I gonna have to pay for you, too?

2484
02:10:39,180 --> 02:10:40,220
Oh my god.

2485
02:10:40,460 --> 02:10:42,500
I feel like I'm gonna have to pay for this guy as well.

2486
02:10:43,420 --> 02:10:44,940
What's my objective?

2487
02:10:46,300 --> 02:10:47,120
Ciao, ciao.

2488
02:10:47,120 --> 02:10:47,980
Lupe.

2489
02:10:49,400 --> 02:10:50,540
The fuck is Jen?

2490
02:10:50,640 --> 02:10:53,160
Is Jen she- she at the red?

2491
02:10:54,100 --> 02:10:55,240
Is that for Redman?

2492
02:10:56,840 --> 02:10:59,600
Okay, Chen Gong Chao Chao wants to talk.

2493
02:11:00,680 --> 02:11:02,600
Like, I don't wanna talk.

2494
02:11:03,760 --> 02:11:07,060
I don't- I don't wanna- I don't wanna join Wu.

2495
02:11:13,900 --> 02:11:16,300
Wait, is it- Is that part of it?

2496
02:11:16,360 --> 02:11:17,280
Oh, it is.

2497
02:11:18,420 --> 02:11:20,300
Okay, what does Chen Gong wanna say?

2498
02:11:37,070 --> 02:11:38,790
I think it's wonderful.

2499
02:11:42,730 --> 02:11:46,950
Hey, you're blue now!

2500
02:11:47,510 --> 02:11:48,610
Wait, was he always blue?

2501
02:11:48,610 --> 02:11:51,050
I know he's gonna be blue.

2502
02:12:00,150 --> 02:12:02,170
Yeah, he's blue before he's purple.

2503
02:12:02,730 --> 02:12:04,010
Before he's gonna be Erpa.

2504
02:12:06,470 --> 02:12:07,070
Oh.

2505
02:12:17,530 --> 02:12:20,730
Bro, I'm like, he's not here to glaze right now.

2506
02:12:21,410 --> 02:12:23,690
Why are you glazing Chao Chao up?

2507
02:12:38,550 --> 02:12:39,250
That's it?

2508
02:12:39,470 --> 02:12:39,910
The fuck?

2509
02:12:40,830 --> 02:12:47,610
He just wanted to meet up to glaze- He just- He just wanted to meet up and glaze him.

2510
02:12:47,670 --> 02:12:48,510
Like, what?

2511
02:12:48,990 --> 02:12:52,110
You made me come all the way here just for that?

2512
02:12:52,290 --> 02:12:52,750
Bro.

2513
02:12:53,090 --> 02:12:53,770
That's fucked.

2514
02:12:54,510 --> 02:12:55,510
That's so fucked.

2515
02:12:55,990 --> 02:12:58,710
Can't believe you made me travel all the way for that.

2516
02:13:02,360 --> 02:13:03,480
Show on map.

2517
02:13:03,540 --> 02:13:04,620
Yeah, show this on map.

2518
02:13:05,700 --> 02:13:06,920
Where is it on the map?

2519
02:13:10,040 --> 02:13:10,480
Doctor!

2520
02:13:10,620 --> 02:13:12,540
I told you to show it on the map!

2521
02:13:15,760 --> 02:13:20,200
Wait, there's an- Wait, there's a guy that's like, question mark.

2522
02:13:21,720 --> 02:13:24,000
Oh, it shows on the mini map.

2523
02:13:24,120 --> 02:13:25,520
Oh, I see.

2524
02:13:26,420 --> 02:13:27,480
I was like, what the fuck?

2525
02:13:29,980 --> 02:13:31,620
I was ready for you to show it.

2526
02:13:33,700 --> 02:13:37,880
Okay, I have to meet an- A character that's like, question- Oh, there he is.

2527
02:13:38,840 --> 02:13:41,520
I don't know how I've missed that guy, but I'll talk to him too.

2528
02:13:42,440 --> 02:13:45,140
Are there some ra- Oh, it's Yang Province.

2529
02:13:45,260 --> 02:13:45,980
Okay, who are you?

2530
02:13:47,340 --> 02:13:47,740
Oh!

2531
02:13:48,820 --> 02:13:50,340
You're one of the newer ones!

2532
02:14:02,720 --> 02:14:03,120
AHHHHHH!

2533
02:14:04,820 --> 02:14:05,240
Oh my

2534
02:14:09,390 --> 02:14:12,830
- Oh my god, oh my god it's him!

2535
02:14:13,970 --> 02:14:14,330
AHHHH!

2536
02:14:17,520 --> 02:14:18,730
I don't care about you!

2537
02:14:19,170 --> 02:14:20,370
Get out, get out!

2538
02:14:21,130 --> 02:14:22,270
Get out!

2539
02:14:22,530 --> 02:14:23,090
I don't...

2540
02:14:23,990 --> 02:14:28,690
I don't care... I don't care, I don't care...

2541
02:14:28,690 --> 02:14:29,170
AHHHH!

2542
02:14:33,090 --> 02:14:36,030
Oh my god, wait, where's your mustache?

2543
02:14:37,290 --> 02:14:39,010
Wait, no, nevermind...

2544
02:14:39,010 --> 02:14:40,550
I don't care anymore.

2545
02:14:49,250 --> 02:14:51,550
He doesn't have his mustache.

2546
02:14:58,730 --> 02:15:04,010
Okay, well it is intriguing to meet a guardian of peace in the flesh.

2547
02:15:05,190 --> 02:15:07,470
I've heard that you have lost all your memories.

2548
02:15:07,590 --> 02:15:08,490
Where's Stache?

2549
02:15:08,510 --> 02:15:09,130
How unfortunate.

2550
02:15:09,290 --> 02:15:09,950
Where is mustache?

2551
02:15:11,170 --> 02:15:11,810
Where is it?

2552
02:15:11,870 --> 02:15:12,470
What happened?

2553
02:15:12,570 --> 02:15:13,610
Why did you shave?

2554
02:15:14,190 --> 02:15:14,590
Why?

2555
02:15:15,110 --> 02:15:15,330
Why?

2556
02:15:17,450 --> 02:15:29,290
Chugal young is more knowledgeable than anyone I know, but his behavior is somewhat unconventional and You on the other hand are always downplaying your extraordinary intelligence.

2557
02:15:29,290 --> 02:15:30,430
Don't care about him.

2558
02:15:30,530 --> 02:15:35,710
He is does not matter I find it quite vexing Anyway, where's your mustache?

2559
02:15:37,050 --> 02:15:39,310
You were almost perfect!

2560
02:15:40,090 --> 02:15:46,930
You looked so good everywhere else, but the no mustache just kills it.

2561
02:15:47,810 --> 02:15:48,550
Sorry about all that.

2562
02:15:48,610 --> 02:15:50,110
Why did you shave?

2563
02:15:51,710 --> 02:15:53,270
My eyes are not quite as sharp.

2564
02:15:53,330 --> 02:15:56,390
Ah, the wonder they only showed the backside.

2565
02:15:56,530 --> 02:15:57,950
So there is something I wish to ask you.

2566
02:15:58,050 --> 02:15:59,350
No wonder.

2567
02:16:00,210 --> 02:16:02,810
Which of the major lords has impressed you the most?

2568
02:16:06,430 --> 02:16:07,510
Lord Lube.

2569
02:16:09,510 --> 02:16:10,310
I thought so.

2570
02:16:11,150 --> 02:16:13,110
I also feel that there's something.

2571
02:16:13,250 --> 02:16:13,510
He's young.

2572
02:16:13,670 --> 02:16:14,890
He can always grow.

2573
02:16:14,950 --> 02:16:15,750
Oh, you're right.

2574
02:16:16,410 --> 02:16:16,870
You're right.

2575
02:16:19,210 --> 02:16:21,650
That's enough for now, Shishu.

2576
02:16:22,350 --> 02:16:23,150
You're right.

2577
02:16:23,230 --> 02:16:24,550
You're so right guys.

2578
02:16:24,710 --> 02:16:25,750
You shouldn't ask questions.

2579
02:16:26,050 --> 02:16:26,770
You're so right.

2580
02:16:26,930 --> 02:16:28,730
You've already decided the answer to.

2581
02:16:29,990 --> 02:16:31,030
Guys, you're so right.

2582
02:16:31,050 --> 02:16:33,050
I can certainly understand your sentiment.

2583
02:16:33,570 --> 02:16:40,750
However, for Lord Lube to achieve conquest, he will have to walk a long and perilous path.

2584
02:16:41,510 --> 02:16:43,110
That's why I want to help him.

2585
02:16:43,950 --> 02:16:46,650
Although perhaps... I'm not paying attention to this conversation.

2586
02:16:50,490 --> 02:16:51,810
Thank you.

2587
02:16:52,130 --> 02:16:54,550
Your words of encouragement mean a lot.

2588
02:16:55,150 --> 02:16:56,490
I don't care about Shishu.

2589
02:16:56,850 --> 02:16:58,050
I don't have the opportunity to speak again soon.

2590
02:17:00,750 --> 02:17:04,170
They shamed all the good ones.

2591
02:17:07,420 --> 02:17:08,980
Where is he?

2592
02:17:09,320 --> 02:17:11,640
No, I don't want to talk to you!

2593
02:17:12,480 --> 02:17:14,980
I want to talk to Jucatlan!

2594
02:17:16,160 --> 02:17:18,100
Give me Jucatlan!

2595
02:17:19,260 --> 02:17:21,020
Give it to me!

2596
02:17:23,580 --> 02:17:26,700
I don't care about you!

2597
02:17:31,740 --> 02:17:34,040
I don't care.

2598
02:17:34,240 --> 02:17:35,100
Where is he?

2599
02:17:38,120 --> 02:17:42,720
Okay, I'm gonna... I'm going back home.

2600
02:17:42,900 --> 02:17:44,400
I'm replaying that cutscene.

2601
02:17:45,800 --> 02:17:47,780
Where did he go?

2602
02:17:50,180 --> 02:17:51,960
Where is he?

2603
02:17:53,680 --> 02:17:55,440
Where is he?

2604
02:18:02,090 --> 02:18:04,410
Wait, where's the cutscene?

2605
02:18:08,990 --> 02:18:11,030
I can't even replay that!

2606
02:18:21,700 --> 02:18:24,220
Oh, oh, oh, there's TauTau.

2607
02:18:24,280 --> 02:18:25,040
Okay, here we go.

2608
02:18:26,280 --> 02:18:27,140
Where is he?

2609
02:18:30,100 --> 02:18:31,380
Where is he?

2610
02:18:34,510 --> 02:18:35,730
Is it this?

2611
02:18:36,210 --> 02:18:36,750
No.

2612
02:18:38,850 --> 02:18:40,590
Where is he?

2613
02:18:45,790 --> 02:18:46,990
What do you mean?

2614
02:18:47,510 --> 02:18:48,590
Oh, it's in records?

2615
02:18:48,690 --> 02:18:49,150
Oh, okay.

2616
02:18:54,600 --> 02:18:55,480
Wait, where?

2617
02:19:00,750 --> 02:19:03,510
Wait, why do I... why is it just...

2618
02:19:05,630 --> 02:19:06,670
It's Bonds?

2619
02:19:10,010 --> 02:19:10,970
Where is he?

2620
02:19:13,090 --> 02:19:14,390
Where is he?

2621
02:19:14,390 --> 02:19:14,450
Where is he?

2622
02:19:16,990 --> 02:19:18,210
How do I...

2623
02:19:21,040 --> 02:19:22,740
How do I...

2624
02:19:22,740 --> 02:19:25,160
How do I watch it?

2625
02:19:26,620 --> 02:19:28,180
Is it his Bond?

2626
02:19:31,520 --> 02:19:32,960
No, it's not.

2627
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:33,860
It's not.

2628
02:19:34,620 --> 02:19:36,480
Oh, it's Zushu's Bond?

2629
02:19:42,600 --> 02:19:43,800
Where is he?

2630
02:19:47,480 --> 02:19:48,600
Okay, I'm ready.

2631
02:19:48,960 --> 02:19:50,000
I got it ready.

2632
02:19:53,840 --> 02:19:54,660
Okay.

2633
02:19:55,160 --> 02:19:56,440
Nice to meet you.

2634
02:19:57,200 --> 02:19:57,760
I don't care.

2635
02:19:58,100 --> 02:19:59,260
I don't care.

2636
02:20:04,820 --> 02:20:06,180
Oh my god.

2637
02:20:09,460 --> 02:20:10,180
No!

2638
02:20:10,600 --> 02:20:10,820
No!

2639
02:20:15,570 --> 02:20:17,240
There you go.

2640
02:20:17,640 --> 02:20:18,240
There you go.

2641
02:20:19,180 --> 02:20:20,620
Oh, okay.

2642
02:20:20,620 --> 02:20:21,780
Yay!

2643
02:20:25,160 --> 02:20:26,040
Yay!

2644
02:20:27,880 --> 02:20:30,060
You're so much hotter now!

2645
02:20:30,460 --> 02:20:31,060
Oh, no!

2646
02:20:31,540 --> 02:20:31,900
No!

2647
02:20:36,400 --> 02:20:38,820
Okay, I'm okay now.

2648
02:20:39,620 --> 02:20:41,080
I'm okay now.

2649
02:20:41,920 --> 02:20:45,740
I'm alright now.

2650
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:47,020
I'm happy now.

2651
02:20:47,720 --> 02:20:48,720
I got what I wanted.

2652
02:20:49,860 --> 02:20:51,640
It does look better!

2653
02:20:52,120 --> 02:20:54,420
It looks so much better with my mustache!

2654
02:20:55,360 --> 02:20:56,600
It does!

2655
02:21:01,380 --> 02:21:02,800
I'm okay now.

2656
02:21:02,940 --> 02:21:03,660
I'm happy.

2657
02:21:04,080 --> 02:21:05,120
I'm happy now.

2658
02:21:05,260 --> 02:21:05,860
Yippee!

2659
02:21:07,800 --> 02:21:09,180
That's all it takes.

2660
02:21:09,520 --> 02:21:11,060
That's all it takes for me.

2661
02:21:11,940 --> 02:21:13,360
Okay, Yang Province.

2662
02:21:13,540 --> 02:21:14,780
I should find it here.

2663
02:21:14,960 --> 02:21:16,100
I should find the herb.

2664
02:21:16,100 --> 02:21:18,020
Or whatever here.

2665
02:21:20,980 --> 02:21:24,140
Where the fuck is this herb I have to find?

2666
02:21:29,360 --> 02:21:30,480
Is it here?

2667
02:21:32,720 --> 02:21:34,960
No, that's the old clay.

2668
02:21:36,100 --> 02:21:37,140
Oh, it might be this.

2669
02:21:38,200 --> 02:21:39,240
There you go.

2670
02:21:39,920 --> 02:21:40,740
I found it!

2671
02:21:41,760 --> 02:21:43,040
I did it!

2672
02:21:43,160 --> 02:21:46,120
Okay, he wanted one anyway, so...

2673
02:21:46,120 --> 02:21:47,320
I'll take it back here.

2674
02:21:49,680 --> 02:21:50,700
I got it!

2675
02:21:52,260 --> 02:21:54,180
Alright, time to test it.

2676
02:21:56,180 --> 02:21:58,420
It'll make incense out of it right away.

2677
02:21:58,520 --> 02:21:59,800
Why don't we try the scent in the village?

2678
02:21:59,880 --> 02:22:00,780
Let's go there now!

2679
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:02,800
Alright, let's go to the village!

2680
02:22:03,740 --> 02:22:04,600
Let's go!

2681
02:22:04,960 --> 02:22:06,660
Let's take that incense!

2682
02:22:07,840 --> 02:22:09,540
Wait, how do I go to the village again?

2683
02:22:09,600 --> 02:22:10,000
Is it here?

2684
02:22:10,080 --> 02:22:10,600
Oh, it's here.

2685
02:22:11,520 --> 02:22:13,360
Alright, head to the village.

2686
02:22:14,820 --> 02:22:15,180
Gah!

2687
02:22:18,080 --> 02:22:19,360
Marsha, thank you for the super chat!

2688
02:22:19,580 --> 02:22:20,020
Thank you, thank you!

2689
02:22:20,080 --> 02:22:22,520
Such a shame Connor Hall never became a king.

2690
02:22:22,660 --> 02:22:23,660
It would have been so funny.

2691
02:22:23,840 --> 02:22:24,680
Thank you for the super chat!

2692
02:22:24,840 --> 02:22:25,700
Thank you, thank you!

2693
02:22:27,020 --> 02:22:28,640
Reg, thank you for the super chat!

2694
02:22:28,720 --> 02:22:29,460
Thank you, thank you!

2695
02:22:29,540 --> 02:22:33,080
I got to grow a mustache now for no reason in particular.

2696
02:22:33,380 --> 02:22:34,800
Thank you for the super chat!

2697
02:22:34,940 --> 02:22:35,980
Thank you, thank you!

2698
02:22:41,210 --> 02:22:43,110
Yo, Ayo and my homie!

2699
02:22:43,430 --> 02:22:44,170
You and Ha!

2700
02:22:44,370 --> 02:22:47,310
And get that incense out in the abandoned village!

2701
02:22:47,310 --> 02:22:48,010
Let's go!

2702
02:22:51,480 --> 02:22:53,660
Ayo and my child doctor!

2703
02:23:11,860 --> 02:23:15,300
It has not fucking hit purity yet.

2704
02:23:17,360 --> 02:23:19,160
But we grew up together.

2705
02:23:26,400 --> 02:23:28,080
I feel like this playthrough...

2706
02:23:28,860 --> 02:23:32,400
This particular part has been the most progress we've ever made.

2707
02:23:32,740 --> 02:23:33,640
Game-wise.

2708
02:23:36,280 --> 02:23:39,820
We've actually been in so many battles to progress.

2709
02:23:56,040 --> 02:23:59,080
I heard there was another rebellion down south.

2710
02:24:00,300 --> 02:24:03,220
Only one fate awaits those who oppose the Han.

2711
02:24:05,580 --> 02:24:09,280
The leaders of these rebellions must be aware of this.

2712
02:24:10,120 --> 02:24:11,240
How could they not be?

2713
02:24:12,760 --> 02:24:15,860
But there is a reason they are so determined to act.

2714
02:24:17,280 --> 02:24:19,860
Soon it will be our turn to play our roles.

2715
02:24:20,920 --> 02:24:22,580
Ah, what do you mean we?

2716
02:24:22,920 --> 02:24:23,880
Where are you?

2717
02:24:25,280 --> 02:24:27,200
Ziluan, are you ready?

2718
02:24:28,280 --> 02:24:29,660
It's a role you should know well.

2719
02:24:29,680 --> 02:24:30,240
What the fuck do you mean we?

2720
02:24:31,040 --> 02:24:33,180
The Han Dynasty is collapsing.

2721
02:24:33,680 --> 02:24:34,960
Discontent is rife.

2722
02:24:35,520 --> 02:24:38,080
Enemies within and without plot its demise.

2723
02:24:39,060 --> 02:24:40,300
It cannot go on.

2724
02:24:40,560 --> 02:24:41,780
Something must give.

2725
02:24:42,680 --> 02:24:48,780
The time will come when we must risk our lives and fulfill our roles as the guardians of peace.

2726
02:24:50,040 --> 02:24:51,380
Ziluan, listen.

2727
02:24:51,380 --> 02:24:56,280
When that time comes, you and Zhuhua will become my wings.

2728
02:24:56,620 --> 02:24:57,720
We did this together.

2729
02:24:58,680 --> 02:24:59,200
Yippee!

2730
02:25:00,100 --> 02:25:03,020
They say as I only see him when the incense goes hard.

2731
02:25:09,730 --> 02:25:12,070
A duty you would give your life to fulfill.

2732
02:25:12,070 --> 02:25:12,550
You were listening?

2733
02:25:14,630 --> 02:25:17,850
What were you doing while I was in my fucking trance?

2734
02:25:18,870 --> 02:25:22,610
I mean, what good are you to your duty or anyone else if you end up dying?

2735
02:25:23,250 --> 02:25:25,910
When he lived, my father was lauded as a saint.

2736
02:25:26,330 --> 02:25:30,250
But now that he's gone, nobody so much as speaks his name.

2737
02:25:31,390 --> 02:25:34,410
But I suppose we all have our own way of doing things.

2738
02:25:34,830 --> 02:25:36,710
Who am I to say what the correct way is?

2739
02:25:38,350 --> 02:25:41,450
Still, I wonder what Bai Luman was trying to achieve.

2740
02:25:42,310 --> 02:25:45,570
The title Guardian of Peace sounds grand, sure.

2741
02:25:46,270 --> 02:25:48,630
But what exactly do you- I killed Lu Bu!

2742
02:25:48,770 --> 02:25:50,070
What the fuck do you mean?

2743
02:25:50,150 --> 02:25:51,130
You were there!

2744
02:25:52,050 --> 02:25:55,570
That should be enough to show you what my duty was.

2745
02:25:57,250 --> 02:26:00,550
Like, what was your job, Doki?

2746
02:26:01,050 --> 02:26:03,050
What was your purpose?

2747
02:26:03,430 --> 02:26:08,430
I'm like, what the fuck do you- I killed Lu- What more do you want from me?

2748
02:26:12,490 --> 02:26:15,130
What the fuck more do you want?

2749
02:26:15,130 --> 02:26:16,510
It's been snooping around.

2750
02:26:16,670 --> 02:26:16,830
Yeah.

2751
02:26:18,510 --> 02:26:20,810
You didn't save Sun Jian.

2752
02:26:21,930 --> 02:26:23,610
Doesn't need a key to restoring your memories.

2753
02:26:23,790 --> 02:26:25,790
Good, then we'll try to try some other scents as well.

2754
02:26:26,330 --> 02:26:29,330
I heard there's a rare herb that can be found in Jing Promise.

2755
02:26:29,470 --> 02:26:30,830
It's apparently called Moongrass.

2756
02:26:31,330 --> 02:26:33,190
Oh no, gonna hit the good stuff.

2757
02:26:33,630 --> 02:26:35,730
I can't make the next incense without it.

2758
02:26:35,850 --> 02:26:37,450
Okay, it is in...

2759
02:26:38,710 --> 02:26:39,790
What was it in?

2760
02:26:41,990 --> 02:26:43,510
Okay, let's just talk to Lu Bei.

2761
02:26:43,690 --> 02:26:44,910
I don't want to...

2762
02:26:44,910 --> 02:26:46,770
I don't want to get addicted.

2763
02:26:47,130 --> 02:26:48,390
Let's go talk to him.

2764
02:26:50,530 --> 02:26:53,370
Guys, we gotta make sure we don't get addicted here.

2765
02:26:55,210 --> 02:26:56,830
Okay, where is the Lu Bei?

2766
02:26:57,010 --> 02:26:57,650
Oh, it's this way.

2767
02:26:59,050 --> 02:27:01,070
We gotta make sure we...

2768
02:27:01,770 --> 02:27:04,870
We, like, take it in, like...

2769
02:27:04,870 --> 02:27:06,150
And, like, back in, like...

2770
02:27:06,150 --> 02:27:07,070
What's the word called?

2771
02:27:08,210 --> 02:27:10,230
Make sure we don't take it too much.

2772
02:27:11,890 --> 02:27:16,810
Okay, you have become unable to assist or join any faction you have not made you wish to proceed.

2773
02:27:17,710 --> 02:27:18,130
Yeah.

2774
02:27:21,310 --> 02:27:22,190
Yeah, moderation.

2775
02:27:22,410 --> 02:27:24,170
Yeah, we are doing moderation, guys.

2776
02:27:33,390 --> 02:27:34,430
What about his dad?

2777
02:27:53,370 --> 02:27:55,170
Oh my god, no!

2778
02:27:59,470 --> 02:28:03,570
Oh my god, the random gossip in ancient China in this random village.

2779
02:28:07,010 --> 02:28:09,150
How did you find out about it?

2780
02:28:14,730 --> 02:28:17,330
I feel like villagers back then...

2781
02:28:17,330 --> 02:28:20,250
It's really hard to hear these rumors because they're like...

2782
02:28:20,250 --> 02:28:22,410
There's no phones or like...

2783
02:28:22,410 --> 02:28:24,090
And a lot of them can't read.

2784
02:28:24,430 --> 02:28:25,230
So it's like...

2785
02:28:25,230 --> 02:28:28,170
How did you find out, Mr. Random fucking villager?

2786
02:28:30,090 --> 02:28:32,010
How did he find out?

2787
02:28:41,290 --> 02:28:43,650
I guess merchants and traders.

2788
02:28:43,770 --> 02:28:44,250
You're right.

2789
02:28:44,910 --> 02:28:47,230
Yeah, but it also takes a long time to travel.

2790
02:30:11,450 --> 02:30:12,510
Speak, pretty boy.

2791
02:30:14,570 --> 02:30:14,910
Position.

2792
02:30:15,510 --> 02:30:19,510
A position strong enough to seek to conquer the entire realm.

2793
02:30:20,150 --> 02:30:22,890
I take it you are prepared to do so?

2794
02:30:23,890 --> 02:30:24,330
I am.

2795
02:30:25,890 --> 02:30:27,870
This time, your father is dead.

2796
02:30:28,030 --> 02:30:28,910
Now grow a mustache.

2797
02:30:29,750 --> 02:30:30,410
And history will tell.

2798
02:30:32,170 --> 02:30:33,650
To become the true father.

2799
02:30:33,750 --> 02:30:36,550
That is why I have gathered the wisest and bravest in the land.

2800
02:30:36,770 --> 02:30:37,650
And Diaochan.

2801
02:30:41,850 --> 02:30:42,970
And Dianwei.

2802
02:30:43,130 --> 02:30:43,790
Sorry, Dianwei.

2803
02:30:44,570 --> 02:30:49,140
I was like, I've gathered the wisest and most intelligent and then we have like...

2804
02:30:50,230 --> 02:30:51,530
Big southern man there.

2805
02:30:52,770 --> 02:30:55,770
Well, it feels great to have a clear objective.

2806
02:30:58,390 --> 02:31:01,630
We are about to embark on the path.

2807
02:31:02,030 --> 02:31:03,730
Dianwei is the brave one.

2808
02:31:07,810 --> 02:31:10,910
What he says is right.

2809
02:31:13,170 --> 02:31:14,570
And yet...

2810
02:31:14,570 --> 02:31:14,990
Whoa.

2811
02:31:17,190 --> 02:31:19,190
He's already scheming!

2812
02:31:24,060 --> 02:31:25,720
Oh my god.

2813
02:31:26,680 --> 02:31:28,180
He's scheming already.

2814
02:31:29,260 --> 02:31:31,100
I am deeply grateful for your help.

2815
02:31:31,600 --> 02:31:33,080
I need to thank you properly.

2816
02:31:35,220 --> 02:31:36,440
Yeah, did not get textured.

2817
02:31:36,660 --> 02:31:39,660
You can tell they did not spend time texturing him.

2818
02:31:40,820 --> 02:31:44,720
His texture compared to Lu Bei is actually crazy.

2819
02:31:44,720 --> 02:31:49,740
But the fact is, I need you to lend me your strength again.

2820
02:31:50,840 --> 02:31:51,420
My strength?

2821
02:31:53,060 --> 02:31:58,080
Yes, Tao Qian, governor of Shu province, is in peril.

2822
02:31:58,900 --> 02:32:00,060
Would you go to his aid?

2823
02:32:01,560 --> 02:32:04,600
Lord Tao Qian, has something happened in Shu?

2824
02:32:05,880 --> 02:32:07,020
Were you aware...

2825
02:32:07,020 --> 02:32:09,700
I don't think he realized he's not the main character, guys.

2826
02:32:11,880 --> 02:32:13,040
Yes, I had heard.

2827
02:32:13,840 --> 02:32:20,140
Upon receiving his appointment, he invited his father, Lord Cao Song, to his province.

2828
02:32:21,080 --> 02:32:25,680
On the way, Lord Cao Song stopped at Lord Tao Qian's residence.

2829
02:32:26,180 --> 02:32:29,760
And there, he died under suspicious circumstances.

2830
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:31,760
No.

2831
02:32:33,960 --> 02:32:41,220
Cao Cao, believing Lord Tao Qian was to blame, ordered his troops to ravage Shu.

2832
02:32:43,040 --> 02:32:46,160
But Lord Tao Qian is a man of integrity.

2833
02:32:46,940 --> 02:32:49,660
I cannot imagine him doing anything like that.

2834
02:32:49,660 --> 02:32:50,300
How would you know?

2835
02:32:50,720 --> 02:32:53,140
There's so many assassinations almost every day.

2836
02:32:53,340 --> 02:32:54,420
How would you know?

2837
02:32:54,680 --> 02:32:55,280
I, too, have often heard...

2838
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:57,740
That he is a good man.

2839
02:32:57,840 --> 02:32:59,340
He could be spreading those rumors.

2840
02:33:00,180 --> 02:33:03,640
Clearly, who's gonna fact check the internet that hasn't been invented yet?

2841
02:33:03,820 --> 02:33:05,020
I expect he would try to...

2842
02:33:05,020 --> 02:33:07,300
I can literally spread rumors in ancient China.

2843
02:33:07,440 --> 02:33:08,540
People will believe it.

2844
02:33:09,840 --> 02:33:10,360
But...

2845
02:33:10,360 --> 02:33:11,660
It appears he has neglected to do so.

2846
02:33:11,660 --> 02:33:12,820
Who's gonna fact check me?

2847
02:33:14,560 --> 02:33:14,880
XD

2848
02:33:37,640 --> 02:33:38,880
Oh, what the fuck do you mean?

2849
02:33:38,960 --> 02:33:39,600
Yes, they are.

2850
02:33:41,100 --> 02:33:42,720
You don't know about dolphins, guys.

2851
02:33:43,040 --> 02:33:47,680
Lord Liu Bei, please, go to the aid of Lord Tao Qian.

2852
02:33:48,660 --> 02:33:51,920
Save my friend and the people of Shu.

2853
02:33:54,240 --> 02:33:55,480
Lord Kong Zhong.

2854
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:03,880
Alright, Liu Bei, come.

2855
02:34:04,620 --> 02:34:05,660
Now we're back here.

2856
02:34:12,880 --> 02:34:16,000
So, you accepted his request, then?

2857
02:34:16,640 --> 02:34:19,800
There is never a dull moment with you, brother.

2858
02:34:19,800 --> 02:34:27,820
Still, why would Lord Cao Cao take such a drastic step?

2859
02:34:29,280 --> 02:34:30,060
I don't know.

2860
02:34:31,100 --> 02:34:35,080
What I do know is that Lord Cao Cao scares me.

2861
02:34:36,020 --> 02:34:41,800
I can't shake the feeling that if we're not careful, we may become his next target.

2862
02:34:42,300 --> 02:34:45,540
I mean, he was pretty scary back then.

2863
02:34:45,680 --> 02:34:48,060
There is some noble purpose behind this brutal invasion.

2864
02:34:49,600 --> 02:34:57,000
Yet, no matter how one attempts to justify it, the fact remains that he is perpetrating a heinous act.

2865
02:34:57,700 --> 02:35:03,140
Although, I suppose one could argue this is why I am a less worthy man than him.

2866
02:35:03,820 --> 02:35:05,720
I am always too idealistic.

2867
02:35:06,420 --> 02:35:09,440
No, not in my eyes, at least, brother.

2868
02:35:10,340 --> 02:35:11,680
I fully agree with you.

2869
02:35:12,480 --> 02:35:16,500
Following the most righteous path does not always lead to virtue.

2870
02:35:17,300 --> 02:35:22,280
There are times when virtue comes from following the path of the greater good.

2871
02:35:22,740 --> 02:35:23,460
Quan Yu.

2872
02:35:23,900 --> 02:35:25,520
Quan Yu, don't enable him.

2873
02:35:25,780 --> 02:35:29,700
Well, I don't know, sir, but one thing I do know, I won't stand for such brutality.

2874
02:35:29,700 --> 02:35:30,100
Don't enable him.

2875
02:35:30,140 --> 02:35:31,700
He's gonna be a fucking joke.

2876
02:35:32,120 --> 02:35:33,440
And I'm gonna- From Dao Tower or anyone else.

2877
02:35:33,560 --> 02:35:35,520
I'm gonna be the one enabling him.

2878
02:35:36,920 --> 02:35:38,600
You can only follow your own heart.

2879
02:35:39,200 --> 02:35:45,100
Whatever path you choose, we, your sworn brothers, will do our best to pave the way.

2880
02:35:46,500 --> 02:35:47,880
You don't need to enable him.

2881
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:49,900
I'll be there to do it for you guys.

2882
02:35:51,900 --> 02:35:53,100
Oh nice, okay.

2883
02:35:54,120 --> 02:35:54,980
Mission available.

2884
02:35:57,600 --> 02:35:58,980
Rescue the village.

2885
02:35:59,360 --> 02:36:00,980
Okay, so we gotta do...

2886
02:36:02,740 --> 02:36:04,280
Is this the green side?

2887
02:36:05,300 --> 02:36:06,100
Zombie green.

2888
02:36:08,040 --> 02:36:09,220
Okay, I'm gonna start.

2889
02:36:11,540 --> 02:36:14,620
Wait, actually, let's talk to- Oh, let's talk to him first.

2890
02:36:17,160 --> 02:36:18,540
Hello, Xun Yu.

2891
02:36:19,540 --> 02:36:20,000
Hello.

2892
02:36:25,580 --> 02:36:27,120
What a pleasure meeting you here.

2893
02:36:27,440 --> 02:36:27,820
Wow.

2894
02:36:28,860 --> 02:36:31,720
You seem to be getting along so well with Lord Xun Yu.

2895
02:36:32,300 --> 02:36:35,100
I was hoping to get a chance to talk with you myself.

2896
02:36:35,300 --> 02:36:36,340
You're getting jealous?

2897
02:36:37,780 --> 02:36:38,540
Getting along?

2898
02:36:39,100 --> 02:36:42,040
Well, he is always bringing up a conversation.

2899
02:36:42,220 --> 02:36:42,900
That's me!

2900
02:36:43,680 --> 02:36:44,880
I would be grateful.

2901
02:36:45,800 --> 02:36:46,500
He's jealous!

2902
02:36:46,520 --> 02:36:47,400
If I could grow closer to you as well.

2903
02:36:47,700 --> 02:36:48,520
Oh my God.

2904
02:36:48,520 --> 02:36:50,700
Let me tell you about what I've been doing.

2905
02:36:50,860 --> 02:36:52,520
Oh my God, he is jealous.

2906
02:36:53,620 --> 02:36:56,160
I was observing how things are among the people in town.

2907
02:36:56,780 --> 02:36:59,460
To ascertain what role the government should play here.

2908
02:36:59,520 --> 02:37:00,540
It's like, how dare you?

2909
02:37:01,460 --> 02:37:02,640
I saw her first.

2910
02:37:02,820 --> 02:37:05,540
Warfare alone is not enough to clear a path forward for our leader.

2911
02:37:05,620 --> 02:37:06,580
He wants in, yeah.

2912
02:37:06,760 --> 02:37:10,360
That is why I spend my free time walking the streets like this.

2913
02:37:13,800 --> 02:37:16,440
Uh, no one- Your enthusiasm is admirable.

2914
02:37:16,780 --> 02:37:17,940
Your praise is most welcome.

2915
02:37:18,560 --> 02:37:23,160
But I am merely carrying out my responsibilities in the service of our leader.

2916
02:37:25,080 --> 02:37:28,000
By the way, may I ask you something personal?

2917
02:37:28,060 --> 02:37:28,060
Sure!

2918
02:37:28,080 --> 02:37:28,740
What do you want to ask?

2919
02:37:29,360 --> 02:37:32,820
You have yet to pledge your allegiance to any specific lord.

2920
02:37:33,420 --> 02:37:34,440
Oh, that's awkward.

2921
02:37:34,520 --> 02:37:37,840
Might you consider putting your towns to use...

2922
02:37:37,840 --> 02:37:38,000
Oh, that's so awkward.

2923
02:37:38,220 --> 02:37:39,860
...among our ranks under Lord Cao Cao's command?

2924
02:37:39,860 --> 02:37:41,460
That's really awkward, buddy.

2925
02:37:42,860 --> 02:37:45,660
Yeah, um, I haven't decided yet.

2926
02:37:45,660 --> 02:37:48,880
If I don't understand, it is not a simple decision.

2927
02:37:49,680 --> 02:37:52,080
But you are a guardian of peace.

2928
02:37:52,220 --> 02:37:53,500
Yeah, about that.

2929
02:37:54,140 --> 02:37:55,720
Don't worry, it can be forbidden.

2930
02:37:56,140 --> 02:37:57,880
That makes it harder, right?

2931
02:37:58,440 --> 02:38:05,900
But it may be your intention to continue to drift across the land like a benevolent breeze, helping as many people as you can.

2932
02:38:06,020 --> 02:38:07,380
But you're just explaining, Lu Bei.

2933
02:38:07,380 --> 02:38:14,080
But you must understand that allying with those walking opposing paths is no different than allying with none at all.

2934
02:38:15,660 --> 02:38:20,260
It will accomplish nothing and will instead further fan the flames of conflict.

2935
02:38:21,180 --> 02:38:22,140
No one wishes for that.

2936
02:38:23,040 --> 02:38:24,540
These are my thoughts on the matter.

2937
02:38:25,700 --> 02:38:28,260
Our land should be governed by one capable leader.

2938
02:38:29,620 --> 02:38:32,440
And that leader can be none other than Lord Cao Cao.

2939
02:38:32,740 --> 02:38:33,880
Oh, that's so awkward.

2940
02:38:33,960 --> 02:38:35,460
It is he who will lead us on the path to peace.

2941
02:38:35,580 --> 02:38:37,560
When he finds out in two minutes.

2942
02:38:37,900 --> 02:38:38,920
Do you not also wish to see what then?

2943
02:38:39,280 --> 02:38:41,360
To the chaos that plagues the land?

2944
02:38:41,860 --> 02:38:44,740
I would not presume to force an answer from you at this moment.

2945
02:38:45,300 --> 02:38:47,280
But please do consider my proposal.

2946
02:38:47,520 --> 02:38:48,760
Don't worry, I'll think about it.

2947
02:38:49,760 --> 02:38:52,100
That is all I wish to discuss with you for now.

2948
02:38:53,200 --> 02:38:55,620
But would you do me the honor of visiting me at my estate?

2949
02:38:55,700 --> 02:38:56,120
Wait, what?

2950
02:38:56,800 --> 02:38:59,240
I would like to foster a friendship between us.

2951
02:39:00,220 --> 02:39:01,680
As men who share a similar fate.

2952
02:39:01,680 --> 02:39:02,620
Wait, at your house?

2953
02:39:03,880 --> 02:39:05,220
We can do it out here.

2954
02:39:05,780 --> 02:39:06,680
Wait, why are you a prick?

2955
02:39:06,740 --> 02:39:07,560
Oh, fade to black.

2956
02:39:07,660 --> 02:39:08,720
Okay, that sounds right.

2957
02:39:11,200 --> 02:39:12,680
Okay, that sounds right.

2958
02:39:12,740 --> 02:39:13,780
That fade to black.

2959
02:39:13,820 --> 02:39:14,080
Yep.

2960
02:39:14,080 --> 02:39:14,660
That.

2961
02:39:14,860 --> 02:39:15,320
Yep.

2962
02:39:17,400 --> 02:39:18,260
All right.

2963
02:39:19,060 --> 02:39:19,780
Oh, man.

2964
02:39:19,940 --> 02:39:20,820
That's so awkward.

2965
02:39:21,040 --> 02:39:21,300
That.

2966
02:39:21,640 --> 02:39:22,040
Yep.

2967
02:39:23,100 --> 02:39:23,600
Whoops.

2968
02:39:23,880 --> 02:39:24,540
Sorry, Taochun.

2969
02:39:24,680 --> 02:39:25,060
Sorry.

2970
02:39:25,360 --> 02:39:25,680
Sorry.

2971
02:39:26,500 --> 02:39:29,860
I know I just visited your house and everything, but...

2972
02:39:29,860 --> 02:39:30,540
Sorry, buddy.

2973
02:39:30,960 --> 02:39:31,700
I'm sorry.

2974
02:39:37,480 --> 02:39:38,920
Look, I...

2975
02:39:38,920 --> 02:39:40,700
Look, Lupe has Guan Yun, okay?

2976
02:39:40,700 --> 02:39:42,520
Oh, it's you.

2977
02:39:43,300 --> 02:39:45,760
I heard you rode out to aid Lord Taochun.

2978
02:39:45,900 --> 02:39:47,320
And I guess Zhao Yun, too.

2979
02:39:47,460 --> 02:39:49,040
They have, like, all the best characters.

2980
02:39:49,280 --> 02:39:51,300
As you can see, I brought extra troops.

2981
02:39:51,820 --> 02:39:52,700
Courtesy of Lord Gongsun Zhang.

2982
02:39:52,720 --> 02:39:53,360
Fucking Lupe sucks.

2983
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:57,180
This is my chance to repay the debt I incurred at Jieshao.

2984
02:39:58,120 --> 02:40:00,440
My spear is at your service.

2985
02:40:03,720 --> 02:40:07,120
Now this is a fine ally to have at my side.

2986
02:40:07,860 --> 02:40:09,720
Like, Taochun just has, like, Xiaodun.

2987
02:40:09,940 --> 02:40:10,460
That's it.

2988
02:40:11,330 --> 02:40:11,680
I

2989
02:40:15,440 --> 02:40:21,740
can't believe Dynasty Warriors has given us a game where...

2990
02:40:22,350 --> 02:40:24,560
Zhou Yu has so...

2991
02:40:24,560 --> 02:40:27,700
Where Zhao Yun has so little screen time.

2992
02:40:28,280 --> 02:40:30,780
That's absolutely insane to me.

2993
02:40:31,120 --> 02:40:33,480
How little screen time Zhao Yun has.

2994
02:40:37,420 --> 02:40:40,860
Taochun's forces are marching on to your missions to stop them.

2995
02:40:40,860 --> 02:40:45,040
We, of course, want to protect Lord Taochun from Cao Cao's army.

2996
02:40:45,400 --> 02:40:48,300
But at the same time, we cannot afford for me to fall into his clutches.

2997
02:40:50,700 --> 02:40:53,180
Brother, are you finally realizing how important you are?

2998
02:40:54,940 --> 02:40:58,400
Uh, I don't want it to be a distraction, but I suppose I need to be protected.

2999
02:40:59,460 --> 02:41:02,960
But be that as it may, the army they have gathered is truly immense.

3000
02:41:03,720 --> 02:41:08,260
It's risky to face their attacks head-on, and we simply try to hold our position.

3001
02:41:08,640 --> 02:41:10,300
We will be overwhelmed in short order.

3002
02:41:10,920 --> 02:41:13,780
Then we should act first to break their momentum.

3003
02:41:14,980 --> 02:41:15,320
I agree.

3004
02:41:15,560 --> 02:41:20,200
If we hit by assaults from the north and the south in particular, we will never be able to hold the lines.

3005
02:41:20,760 --> 02:41:22,940
Then we shall split up and meet the advances separately.

3006
02:41:23,440 --> 02:41:27,020
I will take the position in the front of the castle and dig in against their central assault.

3007
02:41:28,160 --> 02:41:30,840
Remember, the enemy will outnumber us.

3008
02:41:31,620 --> 02:41:35,880
Any retreat will be fraught with danger.

3009
02:41:36,420 --> 02:41:38,760
Worry that we hold the line with the castle at our backs.

3010
02:41:38,760 --> 02:41:42,440
We'll hold them back and seize whatever opportunity presents itself.

3011
02:41:42,620 --> 02:41:44,880
That seems to be our only option.

3012
02:41:45,700 --> 02:41:47,160
Sounds like we're leaving a lot.

3013
02:41:47,200 --> 02:41:47,780
Oh, yeah.

3014
02:41:47,980 --> 02:41:48,680
Nope, that's...

3015
02:41:49,880 --> 02:41:52,280
You might have to wonder, where are our strategists?

3016
02:41:52,400 --> 02:42:02,640
While Taotao has like six of them at the table, we have like, I guess, just Lu Bei making the strategies right now.

3017
02:42:03,680 --> 02:42:04,780
It's a little awkward.

3018
02:42:04,880 --> 02:42:07,380
We don't really have any strategies, guys.

3019
02:42:08,240 --> 02:42:09,240
Not yet.

3020
02:42:11,280 --> 02:42:13,400
Zero strategies versus six.

3021
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:16,760
I believe our str...

3022
02:42:16,760 --> 02:42:22,460
Look, Lu Bei is like, unga bunga strength time before Zhuge Liang comes in here.

3023
02:42:24,080 --> 02:42:26,820
Of course, Zhang Fei is into that.

3024
02:42:27,760 --> 02:42:28,800
Yeah, my spear as well.

3025
02:42:28,900 --> 02:42:30,140
I'll not let you down.

3026
02:42:31,160 --> 02:42:33,980
Oh, I can... let's get Zhao Yun in here for like one time.

3027
02:42:35,660 --> 02:42:36,380
I don't know how...

3028
02:42:36,380 --> 02:42:40,380
He's not that strong compared to Guan Yu, but like, let's give him a bone.

3029
02:42:53,370 --> 02:42:54,410
Alright, let's go here.

3030
02:42:55,750 --> 02:42:56,390
Oh, fuck.

3031
02:42:56,470 --> 02:42:57,350
No, I went the wrong way.

3032
02:42:59,690 --> 02:43:00,290
Let's go.

3033
02:43:00,570 --> 02:43:01,370
I meant here.

3034
02:43:02,630 --> 02:43:04,410
That's where I meant to go, guys.

3035
02:43:06,790 --> 02:43:10,730
Wait, let me see if there's any objective I have to do.

3036
02:43:11,870 --> 02:43:12,450
Uh...

3037
02:43:12,450 --> 02:43:14,850
If there's anyone that I really need to do.

3038
02:43:14,970 --> 02:43:22,390
Launch, activate dramatic success, win five duels, win one duel, defeat 50 foes, sword attack.

3039
02:43:23,470 --> 02:43:24,050
Uh...

3040
02:43:24,050 --> 02:43:30,670
Sword attack, gauntlet, wheel recovery, pull it out.

3041
02:43:30,970 --> 02:43:35,710
None of them are ones that I want to do anything with though, so I don't really care too much.

3042
02:43:36,410 --> 02:43:37,950
Fuck it, let's just use the...

3043
02:43:40,730 --> 02:43:43,530
Fuck it, none of them are ones that I actually care much about.

3044
02:43:45,330 --> 02:43:46,370
So we're just gonna fight.

3045
02:43:49,870 --> 02:43:50,550
Okay, nice.

3046
02:43:55,870 --> 02:43:56,590
That's right!

3047
02:43:57,490 --> 02:43:58,050
Easy!

3048
02:44:02,810 --> 02:44:05,990
Oh, Zhao Yun's dragon flash is one of the best?

3049
02:44:06,090 --> 02:44:07,330
Fucking course it is.

3050
02:44:07,930 --> 02:44:09,330
Not the god of war.

3051
02:44:10,930 --> 02:44:12,790
I shall meet the enemy's attack here.

3052
02:44:13,390 --> 02:44:17,610
We may be at a grave disadvantage, but I have faith in my men.

3053
02:44:20,390 --> 02:44:21,550
All right, let's get...

3054
02:44:21,550 --> 02:44:22,110
Oh, Zhao Yun!

3055
02:44:22,390 --> 02:44:23,350
Get over here!

3056
02:44:24,910 --> 02:44:25,890
No way!

3057
02:44:27,030 --> 02:44:28,370
I got you!

3058
02:44:29,670 --> 02:44:31,270
The weaker of the brothers!

3059
02:44:32,730 --> 02:44:33,750
Or the cousins!

3060
02:44:34,190 --> 02:44:36,150
I keep losing track of these two melony relatives.

3061
02:44:38,010 --> 02:44:39,530
Don't worry, I got you!

3062
02:44:40,110 --> 02:44:41,810
I'll kill the first cousin!

3063
02:44:44,430 --> 02:44:45,270
There you go.

3064
02:44:45,470 --> 02:44:46,370
Get out!

3065
02:44:49,310 --> 02:44:50,110
Where is he?

3066
02:44:50,190 --> 02:44:50,770
Oh, there he is.

3067
02:44:56,590 --> 02:44:57,530
Don't worry!

3068
02:44:58,850 --> 02:45:02,190
I'm killing the people that actually do matter in his army!

3069
02:45:03,070 --> 02:45:03,810
It'll be fine!

3070
02:45:04,270 --> 02:45:04,930
Oh, fuck.

3071
02:45:05,050 --> 02:45:06,290
Okay, um, that's awkward.

3072
02:45:07,010 --> 02:45:07,750
Oh, fuck.

3073
02:45:07,830 --> 02:45:08,390
That's awkward.

3074
02:45:09,430 --> 02:45:10,230
Oh, no!

3075
02:45:12,930 --> 02:45:14,630
Let me just kill Zhao Yun now!

3076
02:45:14,830 --> 02:45:16,310
I swear to god, I'm gonna save you guys!

3077
02:45:16,430 --> 02:45:17,110
I swear to god!

3078
02:45:17,390 --> 02:45:18,090
Oh, no!

3079
02:45:18,150 --> 02:45:18,890
They're heading over!

3080
02:45:19,330 --> 02:45:20,190
I swear to god!

3081
02:45:20,970 --> 02:45:23,090
Just let me kill him first and then I'll come over!

3082
02:45:24,530 --> 02:45:25,290
Jesus Christ.

3083
02:45:27,650 --> 02:45:28,530
No, not Zhao Yun!

3084
02:45:32,550 --> 02:45:34,510
Step aside, I literally just killed you!

3085
02:45:35,670 --> 02:45:36,750
All right, we gotta go help.

3086
02:45:36,930 --> 02:45:37,430
We gotta...

3087
02:45:37,430 --> 02:45:38,210
Oh, this is awkward.

3088
02:45:38,390 --> 02:45:39,610
Oh, this is awkward.

3089
02:45:41,530 --> 02:45:42,970
Oh, this is so awkward.

3090
02:45:43,930 --> 02:45:44,650
Oh, no!

3091
02:45:45,270 --> 02:45:45,930
Oh, no!

3092
02:45:45,990 --> 02:45:46,370
I'm running!

3093
02:45:47,230 --> 02:45:47,250
Oh!

3094
02:45:47,630 --> 02:45:48,650
Okay, don't worry!

3095
02:45:48,710 --> 02:45:49,490
I'm coming over!

3096
02:45:50,710 --> 02:45:51,270
Oh!

3097
02:45:51,390 --> 02:45:52,350
Oh, my god!

3098
02:45:52,510 --> 02:45:54,650
Oh, why are they all dying so fast?

3099
02:45:55,210 --> 02:45:56,010
Oh, gosh!

3100
02:45:56,410 --> 02:45:57,090
Don't worry!

3101
02:45:57,150 --> 02:45:58,050
I'm coming over!

3102
02:45:59,590 --> 02:46:01,690
Oh, we have zero morale!

3103
02:46:02,170 --> 02:46:02,550
Please!

3104
02:46:02,910 --> 02:46:04,250
I swear to god!

3105
02:46:04,610 --> 02:46:05,910
I can do this!

3106
02:46:06,690 --> 02:46:07,490
Eat your buns!

3107
02:46:08,850 --> 02:46:09,370
Please!

3108
02:46:12,650 --> 02:46:13,890
Please, don't stop!

3109
02:46:14,630 --> 02:46:15,490
Stop, guys!

3110
02:46:17,410 --> 02:46:18,310
Yes, you can!

3111
02:46:18,570 --> 02:46:18,970
I'm here!

3112
02:46:19,110 --> 02:46:19,930
I'm literally here!

3113
02:46:20,330 --> 02:46:21,970
I'm literally here!

3114
02:46:24,090 --> 02:46:25,570
I'm literally here, guys!

3115
02:46:25,590 --> 02:46:26,410
We can do this!

3116
02:46:28,850 --> 02:46:30,030
Guys, I'm literally here!

3117
02:46:30,070 --> 02:46:31,290
We can totally do this!

3118
02:46:31,790 --> 02:46:33,190
Guys, we can totally...

3119
02:46:33,970 --> 02:46:34,350
Guys!

3120
02:46:35,010 --> 02:46:35,890
Guys, please!

3121
02:46:38,610 --> 02:46:40,390
We can do this, guys!

3122
02:46:41,050 --> 02:46:41,770
Just believe!

3123
02:46:45,490 --> 02:46:48,950
Oh, god!

3124
02:46:49,290 --> 02:46:50,570
Okay, um...

3125
02:46:52,750 --> 02:46:57,170
Okay, we gotta defeat...

3126
02:46:57,170 --> 02:46:58,090
Okay, let's...

3127
02:46:58,090 --> 02:46:59,610
Let's figure this out.

3128
02:46:59,710 --> 02:47:02,530
This is a little awkward because there's a lot of them.

3129
02:47:02,930 --> 02:47:04,070
So, um...

3130
02:47:04,730 --> 02:47:06,810
I gotta be angry real fast.

3131
02:47:06,870 --> 02:47:07,450
Give me a sec.

3132
02:47:08,450 --> 02:47:10,470
Let me be angry real...

3133
02:47:10,470 --> 02:47:10,890
Real...

3134
02:47:10,890 --> 02:47:11,630
Real fast.

3135
02:47:13,090 --> 02:47:14,510
Okay, there we go.

3136
02:47:15,230 --> 02:47:16,430
This should be fine, right?

3137
02:47:18,670 --> 02:47:20,130
This should be fine, right?

3138
02:47:22,970 --> 02:47:24,270
Jesus Christ!

3139
02:47:24,630 --> 02:47:26,050
There's so many people!

3140
02:47:26,670 --> 02:47:28,230
Oh my god!

3141
02:47:29,250 --> 02:47:32,850
I'm trying my best here!

3142
02:47:34,290 --> 02:47:34,530
Please!

3143
02:47:35,290 --> 02:47:37,910
We need just a little bit more of...

3144
02:47:38,850 --> 02:47:40,070
Now and beyond.

3145
02:47:42,770 --> 02:47:44,310
Do your thing, Dianne!

3146
02:47:47,430 --> 02:47:48,310
Okay, nice.

3147
02:47:48,790 --> 02:47:50,010
Okay, we did it.

3148
02:47:50,390 --> 02:47:51,010
Oh my god!

3149
02:47:51,090 --> 02:47:53,670
Our morale never went up, but it's okay.

3150
02:47:54,050 --> 02:47:55,610
We still did it.

3151
02:47:58,030 --> 02:47:59,450
That's okay, guys.

3152
02:48:00,430 --> 02:48:00,910
Wait, I got...

3153
02:48:00,910 --> 02:48:02,610
I got Zhao Yun's lance!

3154
02:48:04,210 --> 02:48:04,630
Nice.

3155
02:48:05,410 --> 02:48:08,210
The morale meter did not budge.

3156
02:48:08,390 --> 02:48:09,010
It's okay.

3157
02:48:09,170 --> 02:48:09,950
We don't...

3158
02:48:09,950 --> 02:48:10,750
We don't need it.

3159
02:48:10,990 --> 02:48:13,650
My presence is strong enough, right?

3160
02:48:16,010 --> 02:48:17,090
Oh, is this Zhanfei's weapon?

3161
02:48:17,210 --> 02:48:17,830
Oh, never mind.

3162
02:48:17,850 --> 02:48:19,370
This is Zhanfei's weapon.

3163
02:48:25,930 --> 02:48:28,370
How is there so many?

3164
02:48:33,270 --> 02:48:34,630
It's okay.

3165
02:48:38,390 --> 02:48:39,470
We're almost there!

3166
02:48:43,210 --> 02:48:44,770
We did it, guys!

3167
02:48:45,210 --> 02:48:47,070
Oh, all the other generals are dead.

3168
02:48:50,250 --> 02:48:52,010
But we did it!

3169
02:48:53,390 --> 02:48:54,270
Oh, no.

3170
02:48:56,070 --> 02:48:57,430
We still did it, guys!

3171
02:49:03,790 --> 02:49:04,870
Where are we going?

3172
02:49:05,710 --> 02:49:06,570
No, it's not!

3173
02:49:06,850 --> 02:49:07,390
No, it's not!

3174
02:49:07,390 --> 02:49:08,430
Lu Bei, they're all dead!

3175
02:49:08,650 --> 02:49:09,990
What do you mean, Lu Bei?

3176
02:49:10,170 --> 02:49:11,430
They're all dead!

3177
02:49:15,910 --> 02:49:21,030
Lu Bei's group has me and my army of three.

3178
02:49:32,150 --> 02:49:34,250
Where the fuck do we go?

3179
02:49:36,310 --> 02:49:37,090
Oh, no.

3180
02:49:38,570 --> 02:49:39,410
Oh, no.

3181
02:49:39,490 --> 02:49:40,670
I gotta go downstairs.

3182
02:49:41,090 --> 02:49:42,690
There's so many fights!

3183
02:49:45,550 --> 02:49:48,230
Lu Bei, the master strategist.

3184
02:49:52,690 --> 02:49:53,170
Oh, no.

3185
02:49:53,430 --> 02:49:58,270
He still has two eyes, too, guys!

3186
02:50:01,690 --> 02:50:03,410
Guys, he still has two eyes!

3187
02:50:03,430 --> 02:50:04,330
What do I do?

3188
02:50:11,470 --> 02:50:12,830
That's fucking right.

3189
02:50:12,950 --> 02:50:14,530
Oh, that's all I did on him.

3190
02:50:18,090 --> 02:50:19,250
I'm sorry!

3191
02:50:21,050 --> 02:50:23,030
Oh, you definitely care.

3192
02:50:23,130 --> 02:50:23,930
Don't lie!

3193
02:50:25,510 --> 02:50:26,350
Oh, my god!

3194
02:50:26,370 --> 02:50:26,670
No!

3195
02:50:27,090 --> 02:50:28,190
Is this a breakup?

3196
02:50:29,130 --> 02:50:29,630
No!

3197
02:50:31,210 --> 02:50:34,150
Oh, he's breaking up with me!

3198
02:50:34,830 --> 02:50:36,230
I'm sorry!

3199
02:50:37,310 --> 02:50:38,630
You're literally...

3200
02:50:38,630 --> 02:50:41,530
You and Zheng Liao are the only cool ones!

3201
02:50:41,650 --> 02:50:42,650
I'm sorry!

3202
02:50:46,210 --> 02:50:48,450
Oh, no.

3203
02:50:48,850 --> 02:50:49,330
Oh, no.

3204
02:50:49,770 --> 02:50:50,110
Zhao Yun.

3205
02:50:50,610 --> 02:50:51,030
Oh, no.

3206
02:50:51,150 --> 02:50:51,850
Eat your bread!

3207
02:50:52,010 --> 02:50:52,650
Eat your bread!

3208
02:50:56,490 --> 02:50:57,810
I'm sorry!

3209
02:50:58,210 --> 02:51:00,570
I can't believe it!

3210
02:51:01,010 --> 02:51:03,910
He broke up with us, guys!

3211
02:51:03,910 --> 02:51:06,250
With us!

3212
02:51:06,850 --> 02:51:08,670
It was a group effort!

3213
02:51:11,410 --> 02:51:12,670
I'm so sad.

3214
02:51:14,190 --> 02:51:15,990
I can't believe it.

3215
02:51:17,010 --> 02:51:19,170
It's still not up, guys.

3216
02:51:19,270 --> 02:51:21,250
Our morale is still fucked up.

3217
02:51:21,770 --> 02:51:26,250
My team still does not believe.

3218
02:51:28,310 --> 02:51:30,950
Toki, you broke his neck!

3219
02:51:31,430 --> 02:51:33,050
Yeah, but he started it!

3220
02:51:33,050 --> 02:51:35,750
He broke up with us, guys!

3221
02:51:35,990 --> 02:51:36,530
First!

3222
02:51:38,710 --> 02:51:40,670
It had to be done!

3223
02:51:42,150 --> 02:51:43,170
Oh, my god.

3224
02:51:43,230 --> 02:51:45,390
My generals actually fought back?

3225
02:51:47,810 --> 02:51:48,710
Okay, nice.

3226
02:51:50,070 --> 02:51:52,130
Okay, I need you guys...

3227
02:51:52,130 --> 02:51:55,730
I need more of the people that die around me here.

3228
02:51:56,450 --> 02:51:57,510
Where are they?

3229
02:51:57,650 --> 02:51:58,210
There they are.

3230
02:51:58,910 --> 02:52:00,810
It's going by pretty...

3231
02:52:00,810 --> 02:52:02,330
There's so many horses!

3232
02:52:03,930 --> 02:52:05,090
Wait, where is that?

3233
02:52:05,750 --> 02:52:06,630
Where's Guanyin?

3234
02:52:07,590 --> 02:52:08,170
Oh, shit!

3235
02:52:08,210 --> 02:52:08,810
He's over there.

3236
02:52:08,910 --> 02:52:11,010
Okay, Guanyin, I'll come back very soon.

3237
02:52:11,090 --> 02:52:12,930
Let me just grab this base real fast.

3238
02:52:15,010 --> 02:52:16,130
We're almost there!

3239
02:52:18,990 --> 02:52:20,430
This base is almost ours!

3240
02:52:21,490 --> 02:52:21,790
Nice!

3241
02:52:22,870 --> 02:52:23,470
Don't worry, Guanyin.

3242
02:52:23,570 --> 02:52:24,050
I'm coming over!

3243
02:52:24,150 --> 02:52:24,590
I'm coming over!

3244
02:52:24,710 --> 02:52:25,250
I'm coming over!

3245
02:52:25,290 --> 02:52:25,850
I'm coming over!

3246
02:52:26,770 --> 02:52:27,210
Guanyin!

3247
02:52:27,810 --> 02:52:29,130
You can't die like this!

3248
02:52:29,150 --> 02:52:30,810
You're literally a god of war!

3249
02:52:33,230 --> 02:52:34,090
All units!

3250
02:52:34,990 --> 02:52:35,670
Commence the charge!

3251
02:52:36,430 --> 02:52:37,010
Oh, my god!

3252
02:52:37,090 --> 02:52:37,370
Guys!

3253
02:52:39,050 --> 02:52:40,410
Okay, he was fine.

3254
02:52:42,050 --> 02:52:44,870
Wait, I must kill steal this real fast.

3255
02:52:46,930 --> 02:52:47,490
Oh,

3256
02:52:51,650 --> 02:52:52,090
my god!

3257
02:52:52,230 --> 02:52:52,910
We did it!

3258
02:52:57,330 --> 02:52:58,670
Oh, my god!

3259
02:52:58,710 --> 02:53:01,350
Lupe, I don't know what you're trying to do, Lupe!

3260
02:53:09,270 --> 02:53:09,910
Jesus!

3261
02:53:10,110 --> 02:53:11,350
Do it here!

3262
02:53:13,870 --> 02:53:15,910
Lupe does not got this and you know it!

3263
02:53:16,310 --> 02:53:17,750
You guys fucking know this!

3264
02:53:24,070 --> 02:53:25,150
Jesus Christ!

3265
02:53:29,170 --> 02:53:30,670
Oh, my god!

3266
02:53:30,730 --> 02:53:32,710
What is going on?!

3267
02:53:34,230 --> 02:53:35,790
Stop it, please!

3268
02:53:35,870 --> 02:53:37,150
There's so many things!

3269
02:53:39,010 --> 02:53:40,450
Oh, no!

3270
02:53:45,220 --> 02:53:47,180
Wait, how do I prevent that?

3271
02:53:48,440 --> 02:53:49,480
Wait, how?

3272
02:53:50,320 --> 02:53:52,120
How do I prevent it?

3273
02:53:52,860 --> 02:53:54,660
How do I prevent it?

3274
02:53:56,260 --> 02:53:57,920
How do I prevent it?!

3275
02:54:00,360 --> 02:54:02,380
I don't have enough...

3276
02:54:02,380 --> 02:54:03,860
Oh, my god!

3277
02:54:03,860 --> 02:54:05,580
How do I prevent?!

3278
02:54:07,280 --> 02:54:09,180
Oh, my god!

3279
02:54:10,120 --> 02:54:11,760
Guys, I don't have...

3280
02:54:12,340 --> 02:54:12,760
Okay.

3281
02:54:21,530 --> 02:54:23,350
Oh, my god!

3282
02:54:24,450 --> 02:54:25,150
Oh, my god!

3283
02:54:26,890 --> 02:54:27,330
No!

3284
02:54:40,200 --> 02:54:40,740
I still can't think!

3285
02:54:43,680 --> 02:54:44,220
Yoink!

3286
02:54:44,620 --> 02:54:45,840
No, he's killed!

3287
02:54:46,160 --> 02:54:46,220
Stop!

3288
02:54:52,200 --> 02:54:52,740
Okay.

3289
02:54:53,100 --> 02:54:54,260
Okay, I got this.

3290
02:54:56,420 --> 02:54:58,640
Okay, guys, guys, I got this this time.

3291
02:54:58,920 --> 02:55:01,960
Guys, guys, that was like really rough, but I'm okay now.

3292
02:55:03,800 --> 02:55:05,060
I'm okay now.

3293
02:55:06,660 --> 02:55:07,180
I'm okay now.

3294
02:55:07,180 --> 02:55:07,920
Don't worry, guys.

3295
02:55:08,360 --> 02:55:09,460
I'll be fine.

3296
02:55:09,580 --> 02:55:10,480
I'll be fine.

3297
02:55:10,620 --> 02:55:11,920
I'll be fine now.

3298
02:55:12,460 --> 02:55:15,800
I'm not gonna use any of my battle arts until he does his thing.

3299
02:55:17,720 --> 02:55:21,440
I'm gonna wait until he does his thing before I use a battle art.

3300
02:55:21,900 --> 02:55:23,280
I've learned my lesson.

3301
02:55:26,700 --> 02:55:28,520
I learned my lesson.

3302
02:55:30,640 --> 02:55:32,080
It's fine, I have enough.

3303
02:55:36,220 --> 02:55:37,860
Oh, my god!

3304
02:55:45,440 --> 02:55:46,720
Everything is...

3305
02:55:46,720 --> 02:55:47,440
All right, there we go!

3306
02:55:47,540 --> 02:55:48,160
We got it!

3307
02:55:49,400 --> 02:55:51,960
I have something better than the palm!

3308
02:55:53,640 --> 02:55:54,800
Watch this!

3309
02:55:57,840 --> 02:55:59,000
Did I do it?

3310
02:56:00,140 --> 02:56:01,560
There we go!

3311
02:56:05,340 --> 02:56:06,680
Guys, I didn't do it.

3312
02:56:07,060 --> 02:56:08,760
Guys, I didn't do it.

3313
02:56:08,780 --> 02:56:09,920
Okay, let me...

3314
02:56:12,120 --> 02:56:15,460
It looks like I didn't do it, guys.

3315
02:56:16,460 --> 02:56:17,720
Where is he?

3316
02:56:19,960 --> 02:56:20,700
Where's the head?

3317
02:56:20,880 --> 02:56:22,060
Wait, where is he?

3318
02:56:25,160 --> 02:56:26,480
Oh, my god, there he is.

3319
02:56:27,160 --> 02:56:28,200
There he is.

3320
02:56:30,580 --> 02:56:31,380
There we go!

3321
02:56:31,620 --> 02:56:32,160
There we go!

3322
02:56:32,200 --> 02:56:32,640
We did it!

3323
02:56:36,140 --> 02:56:37,360
We did it!

3324
02:56:42,200 --> 02:56:43,400
Oh, my god!

3325
02:56:45,020 --> 02:56:47,200
Get close and do it!

3326
02:56:47,260 --> 02:56:48,160
Oh, I did it!

3327
02:56:48,880 --> 02:56:50,000
Holy shit!

3328
02:56:51,840 --> 02:56:53,220
It's so hard!

3329
02:56:55,720 --> 02:56:56,480
Get over here!

3330
02:56:56,880 --> 02:56:57,720
Oh, I did it!

3331
02:56:57,940 --> 02:56:59,140
Jesus Christ!

3332
02:56:59,720 --> 02:57:02,840
We did it!

3333
02:57:02,920 --> 02:57:03,420
Oh, my god!

3334
02:57:03,460 --> 02:57:04,600
Lupe versus Cao Cao!

3335
02:57:10,440 --> 02:57:11,040
Okay.

3336
02:57:13,180 --> 02:57:14,020
That's fine.

3337
02:57:16,140 --> 02:57:17,740
It's fine, we just kill him.

3338
02:57:18,640 --> 02:57:20,720
I almost have enough for Zhou Yu, don't worry!

3339
02:57:25,960 --> 02:57:26,560
Again?!

3340
02:57:31,330 --> 02:57:32,390
Oh, my...

3341
02:57:32,390 --> 02:57:32,850
Fine.

3342
02:57:33,430 --> 02:57:33,910
Fine.

3343
02:57:34,230 --> 02:57:34,610
Fine.

3344
02:57:35,050 --> 02:57:35,310
Fine.

3345
02:57:35,950 --> 02:57:36,210
Fine!

3346
02:57:36,210 --> 02:57:37,270
Fine!

3347
02:57:37,690 --> 02:57:38,650
Fine!

3348
02:57:39,210 --> 02:57:41,150
I'll do your shit, Cao Cao!

3349
02:57:41,750 --> 02:57:42,490
Fine!

3350
02:57:50,210 --> 02:57:52,130
Jesus Christ!

3351
02:57:53,230 --> 02:57:54,950
I'm trying my best!

3352
02:57:55,450 --> 02:57:56,730
Oh, my god!

3353
02:57:57,990 --> 02:57:58,410
Change!

3354
02:57:58,850 --> 02:57:59,050
Change!

3355
02:57:59,270 --> 02:57:59,770
Change!

3356
02:58:01,110 --> 02:58:02,070
Change!

3357
02:58:02,630 --> 02:58:03,170
Change!

3358
02:58:05,350 --> 02:58:06,450
Change!

3359
02:58:10,170 --> 02:58:10,270
Change!

3360
02:58:10,270 --> 02:58:10,370
Change!

3361
02:58:15,520 --> 02:58:16,070
Okay.

3362
02:58:17,670 --> 02:58:18,210
Okay.

3363
02:58:19,450 --> 02:58:20,150
Rage!

3364
02:58:21,250 --> 02:58:22,410
I'm not jumping!

3365
02:58:22,970 --> 02:58:25,010
They just keep doing it!

3366
02:58:25,510 --> 02:58:28,810
I swear to god, I am not jumping!

3367
02:58:29,610 --> 02:58:31,610
I literally can't move!

3368
02:58:32,570 --> 02:58:36,530
I wish I could move, but I can't!

3369
02:58:41,050 --> 02:58:43,090
Who am I attacking?

3370
02:58:44,350 --> 02:58:45,570
Like, okay, good.

3371
02:58:47,630 --> 02:58:48,350
Okay.

3372
02:58:49,010 --> 02:58:49,610
Thank god.

3373
02:58:51,530 --> 02:58:52,830
I am so fucked up.

3374
02:59:10,310 --> 02:59:11,290
Oh, my god!

3375
02:59:11,730 --> 02:59:12,470
Okay, there you go!

3376
02:59:12,670 --> 02:59:13,610
This has to be it!

3377
02:59:15,110 --> 02:59:15,630
Yes!

3378
02:59:16,230 --> 02:59:17,270
I got one HP!

3379
02:59:19,150 --> 02:59:20,230
We did it!

3380
02:59:21,190 --> 02:59:22,510
Oh, we did it!

3381
02:59:22,770 --> 02:59:23,890
That's so scary!

3382
02:59:24,710 --> 02:59:25,490
Oh, my god!

3383
02:59:27,690 --> 02:59:28,990
More than HP!

3384
02:59:29,170 --> 02:59:29,910
I don't know, dream!

3385
02:59:33,270 --> 02:59:35,490
I literally just killed you!

3386
02:59:46,710 --> 02:59:49,030
He's like, I will never retreat!

3387
02:59:49,430 --> 02:59:50,510
JK, bye!

3388
02:59:53,910 --> 02:59:55,810
What is just...

3389
02:59:56,890 --> 02:59:58,170
Have we won?

3390
03:00:00,890 --> 03:00:01,450
Yay!

3391
03:00:02,310 --> 03:00:03,870
Oh god, that was so rough!

3392
03:00:04,510 --> 03:00:06,630
That was incredibly rough!

3393
03:00:09,130 --> 03:00:11,070
I will not retreat unless...

3394
03:00:13,850 --> 03:00:14,610
29.

3395
03:00:16,550 --> 03:00:18,350
Yay, Furt, you did it!

3396
03:00:22,550 --> 03:00:23,970
Okay, nice, I got that.

3397
03:00:26,390 --> 03:00:27,270
Okay, uh...

3398
03:00:27,270 --> 03:00:28,410
Definitely want more defense.

3399
03:00:28,710 --> 03:00:30,250
Yep, that was very rough for me.

3400
03:00:30,350 --> 03:00:31,210
Oh, fuck!

3401
03:00:31,310 --> 03:00:31,870
Oh, wait, I can!

3402
03:00:31,950 --> 03:00:33,970
Okay, I have the bravery here.

3403
03:00:34,550 --> 03:00:36,390
I was gonna say I forgot about this.

3404
03:00:39,570 --> 03:00:40,970
What the fuck?

3405
03:00:41,370 --> 03:00:42,730
Wait, that's so strong!

3406
03:00:43,390 --> 03:00:44,730
I won't buy it yet, though.

3407
03:00:51,320 --> 03:00:52,560
I don't have enough.

3408
03:00:52,740 --> 03:00:53,960
I'm like, too broke.

3409
03:00:59,140 --> 03:01:03,400
We did it!

3410
03:01:08,240 --> 03:01:09,420
That's just straight...

3411
03:01:09,420 --> 03:01:12,140
Magic in my Dynasty Warriors game!

3412
03:01:12,260 --> 03:01:13,260
How fucking dare they?

3413
03:01:27,180 --> 03:01:29,780
Truly, by a Most Grateful.

3414
03:01:36,020 --> 03:01:40,260
Lord Liu Bei, you are a beacon in this turbulent world.

3415
03:01:40,700 --> 03:01:45,880
An immoral scoundrel like Cao Cao has no hope of defeating a noble man like yourself.

3416
03:01:46,760 --> 03:01:47,940
Immoral, you say?

3417
03:01:48,840 --> 03:01:56,040
I wonder if Lord Cao Cao has ever considered whether his actions are moral or righteous.

3418
03:01:57,160 --> 03:01:57,800
Hmm?

3419
03:01:58,100 --> 03:01:59,260
What do you mean?

3420
03:02:00,260 --> 03:02:08,220
I mean, I have fought alongside Lord Cao Cao many times, and neither righteousness nor greed drive him.

3421
03:02:09,300 --> 03:02:11,400
Instead, only one thing rules his heart.

3422
03:02:12,120 --> 03:02:12,700
Pure reason.

3423
03:02:14,100 --> 03:02:22,200
When he set out to avenge his father's death, I am certain it wasn't rage or grief that drove him to mobilize his army.

3424
03:02:22,800 --> 03:02:26,660
And now, he marches to take the land of Shu.

3425
03:02:27,920 --> 03:02:29,480
Not because it is just or unjust...

3426
03:02:29,480 --> 03:02:31,140
Okay, Liu Bei, I don't trust anything you say anymore.

3427
03:02:31,280 --> 03:02:37,220
Your strategy for that entire run was that maybe we can do it from Shu because we're strong.

3428
03:02:37,560 --> 03:02:38,720
I don't know.

3429
03:02:39,300 --> 03:02:41,680
I didn't realize you held him in such esteem.

3430
03:02:43,180 --> 03:02:45,620
Perhaps I should rethink my opinion of our enemy.

3431
03:02:45,620 --> 03:02:47,020
We got this, guys!

3432
03:02:47,680 --> 03:02:48,340
We are strong.

3433
03:02:49,740 --> 03:02:52,600
And you were surprised when we won.

3434
03:02:56,160 --> 03:02:57,620
Was he wrong?

3435
03:02:58,920 --> 03:03:04,880
If I wasn't in that war, I don't think they would have won.

3436
03:03:05,080 --> 03:03:08,580
And then they have the audacity to write me out of history?

3437
03:03:23,100 --> 03:03:24,300
That's quite an honor.

3438
03:03:30,660 --> 03:03:31,200
Sure.

3439
03:03:32,120 --> 03:03:34,420
Pretty sure the heavens are looking at Guanyin.

3440
03:03:49,220 --> 03:03:50,400
Turned it down?

3441
03:03:50,680 --> 03:03:51,920
Has he gone mad?

3442
03:03:52,360 --> 03:03:55,020
He finally had a chance to move up in the world.

3443
03:03:56,080 --> 03:04:01,340
He said it was too big a responsibility for someone like him without suitable aspirations.

3444
03:04:02,100 --> 03:04:03,680
Or something like that.

3445
03:04:05,040 --> 03:04:06,000
Aspirations, eh?

3446
03:04:06,480 --> 03:04:10,900
Well, they must be something special for him to turn down a whole province.

3447
03:04:12,680 --> 03:04:16,360
But then, what is Tao Chen going to do about Shu?

3448
03:04:16,660 --> 03:04:17,080
Yeah.

3449
03:04:18,960 --> 03:04:20,320
I'll take it.

3450
03:04:24,800 --> 03:04:25,900
Yeah, I'll take it.

3451
03:04:25,980 --> 03:04:26,690
Hello, I'm here.

3452
03:04:29,460 --> 03:04:30,000
I'm here.

3453
03:04:30,280 --> 03:04:30,560
Hello.

3454
03:04:31,140 --> 03:04:31,780
I want to govern.

3455
03:04:35,500 --> 03:04:36,620
Wait, I want to...

3456
03:04:36,620 --> 03:04:37,820
No, I'm here too!

3457
03:04:38,580 --> 03:04:40,200
You guys want to ask for my opinion?

3458
03:04:45,580 --> 03:04:46,300
Fucked up.

3459
03:04:46,300 --> 03:04:48,980
He's literally having this conversation in front of me.

3460
03:04:49,200 --> 03:04:50,560
You don't count!

3461
03:04:53,880 --> 03:04:58,220
Like, they're having this fucking conversation in front of me and they're like, Anyway!

3462
03:04:58,960 --> 03:05:01,280
Sucks that no one else wants to govern.

3463
03:05:09,510 --> 03:05:10,690
Oh, hey, Taoyuan.

3464
03:05:14,170 --> 03:05:16,490
I thought you had a crush on Lupe.

3465
03:05:16,590 --> 03:05:17,190
Why are you here?

3466
03:05:18,390 --> 03:05:18,970
Thank you.

3467
03:05:19,540 --> 03:05:20,210
I know.

3468
03:05:42,190 --> 03:05:45,910
I'm just a beat up NPC to them.

3469
03:06:04,370 --> 03:06:05,490
Jesus Christ.

3470
03:06:06,950 --> 03:06:07,430
Sup?

3471
03:06:12,450 --> 03:06:13,730
I'm thinking about...

3472
03:06:13,730 --> 03:06:14,410
Well, I am joining.

3473
03:06:14,570 --> 03:06:15,630
Yeah, I'm thinking about it.

3474
03:06:27,690 --> 03:06:30,630
He's like, good, at least it's not forbidden now.

3475
03:06:32,730 --> 03:06:34,210
I can't do that.

3476
03:06:34,330 --> 03:06:35,330
Not with my honor.

3477
03:06:44,070 --> 03:06:44,590
Wait!

3478
03:06:44,590 --> 03:06:45,330
What?

3479
03:06:50,750 --> 03:06:53,230
What do you mean by that?

3480
03:06:59,070 --> 03:07:00,830
Oh, he's backtracking.

3481
03:07:01,130 --> 03:07:03,910
He's like, I don't think you will.

3482
03:07:04,130 --> 03:07:05,070
Oh, I mean...

3483
03:07:05,070 --> 03:07:05,610
I mean...

3484
03:07:05,610 --> 03:07:06,330
No, I meant...

3485
03:07:06,850 --> 03:07:08,390
Yeah, no, no, no, no, no.

3486
03:07:12,470 --> 03:07:13,470
Sure, bro.

3487
03:07:14,610 --> 03:07:15,250
Backtrack.

3488
03:07:15,350 --> 03:07:17,050
He's like, oh, he's talking to me like that.

3489
03:07:17,090 --> 03:07:18,010
No, I meant...

3490
03:07:18,010 --> 03:07:19,690
I'm sorry, that's not what I mean.

3491
03:07:22,110 --> 03:07:23,390
All right.

3492
03:07:23,470 --> 03:07:23,790
Wow.

3493
03:07:23,970 --> 03:07:25,750
What the fuck?

3494
03:07:26,970 --> 03:07:28,190
Jesus Christ.

3495
03:07:28,550 --> 03:07:29,290
How many?

3496
03:07:29,550 --> 03:07:30,790
Oh my god.

3497
03:07:30,850 --> 03:07:32,870
I have so many letters.

3498
03:07:33,530 --> 03:07:34,010
Jesus.

3499
03:07:34,730 --> 03:07:35,130
Okay.

3500
03:07:35,690 --> 03:07:36,210
Okay.

3501
03:07:38,270 --> 03:07:43,130
So many letters from all my suitors, guys.

3502
03:07:45,870 --> 03:07:49,170
He has been traveling with you for some time now, hasn't he?

3503
03:07:49,450 --> 03:07:51,810
I visited him once while you were away at battle.

3504
03:07:52,210 --> 03:07:57,810
He looked to be very busy picking herbs and boiling them to prepare some kind of decoction.

3505
03:07:58,210 --> 03:08:01,590
No, I believe it was more like an incense of some sort.

3506
03:08:01,990 --> 03:08:05,810
The smell was dreadful and smoke filled the air, but he didn't seem to mind.

3507
03:08:06,110 --> 03:08:12,990
His desire to cure patients must give him strength to ensure such hardship when faced with medical issues to solve.

3508
03:08:12,990 --> 03:08:14,850
He loses sight of all else.

3509
03:08:15,210 --> 03:08:19,370
It's not a place to make such requests, but please take good care of the doctor and take this all as well.

3510
03:08:19,730 --> 03:08:22,010
I hope you give me something good for both of you.

3511
03:08:22,090 --> 03:08:22,330
All right.

3512
03:08:22,390 --> 03:08:23,450
Thank you for the super chat.

3513
03:08:23,590 --> 03:08:23,810
Thank you.

3514
03:08:23,870 --> 03:08:24,430
Thank you.

3515
03:08:24,690 --> 03:08:26,210
All right, anonymous soldier.

3516
03:08:27,170 --> 03:08:28,590
Another Dragoon super chat.

3517
03:08:29,090 --> 03:08:30,730
Much time has passed since we met.

3518
03:08:31,050 --> 03:08:36,090
I rather not mention my name, but I was once part of the volunteer army and now I fight for Lord Lupe.

3519
03:08:36,410 --> 03:08:39,150
You saved my life and I'm writing this letter to thank you properly.

3520
03:08:39,330 --> 03:08:44,990
Ever since we began marching together as volunteers, I've been impressed by your every move.

3521
03:08:46,670 --> 03:08:51,050
One day I was watching you in battle when an enemy officer's blade appeared before my eyes.

3522
03:08:51,210 --> 03:08:56,710
I couldn't move, but you rushed over and the officer was gone in a blink of an eye.

3523
03:08:57,370 --> 03:08:58,990
That wasn't the only time either.

3524
03:09:00,650 --> 03:09:02,730
You saved me time and time again.

3525
03:09:03,050 --> 03:09:07,150
I want nothing more than to gaze upon you from afar to see where your path takes you.

3526
03:09:07,470 --> 03:09:08,910
We will meet again one day.

3527
03:09:08,930 --> 03:09:09,790
I'm sure of it.

3528
03:09:09,830 --> 03:09:11,690
Thank you for the super chat, anonymous soldier.

3529
03:09:11,690 --> 03:09:13,090
Thank you, thank you.

3530
03:09:13,470 --> 03:09:15,490
All right, what does Xiaohudun want to say?

3531
03:09:16,330 --> 03:09:18,090
Can I convince you to fight for Cao Cao?

3532
03:09:18,490 --> 03:09:21,430
I'm sure that you're already aware of our invasion into Shu province.

3533
03:09:21,810 --> 03:09:24,030
Oh, that was a little too late, Xiaohudun.

3534
03:09:26,930 --> 03:09:27,450
Whoops.

3535
03:09:30,150 --> 03:09:33,230
Oopsie, did not read his letter in time.

3536
03:09:35,310 --> 03:09:37,710
I read it for too late.

3537
03:09:38,650 --> 03:09:39,170
Whoops.

3538
03:09:40,110 --> 03:09:42,770
All right, we'll read the other letters another time.

3539
03:09:43,030 --> 03:09:45,590
There's too many, too many letters.

3540
03:09:46,170 --> 03:09:47,950
Did not age you well.

3541
03:09:48,390 --> 03:09:49,750
After all the work I put in to open this shop.

3542
03:09:49,750 --> 03:09:50,750
I left him on read.

3543
03:09:51,150 --> 03:09:53,430
I'd be in tears if it got burned down in a bottle.

3544
03:09:53,690 --> 03:09:54,870
Whoops, my bad.

3545
03:09:55,290 --> 03:09:55,990
What's this?

3546
03:09:57,430 --> 03:09:58,350
Shop, okay.

3547
03:09:58,930 --> 03:09:59,670
Is there any better?

3548
03:09:59,830 --> 03:10:00,490
Okay, let's see.

3549
03:10:00,570 --> 03:10:02,950
I want to see if there's any of my bonds.

3550
03:10:03,930 --> 03:10:05,550
Oh, it's you.

3551
03:10:07,210 --> 03:10:08,530
All right, champ Xiaohudun.

3552
03:10:10,130 --> 03:10:12,730
Zhuge Liang, Zhuge Liang, Zhuge Liang, Zhuge Liang, Zhuge Liang, Zhuge Liang.

3553
03:10:14,510 --> 03:10:17,790
Guys, we gotta... we have someone very important to talk to.

3554
03:10:19,750 --> 03:10:21,650
I didn't see what province he was in.

3555
03:10:21,770 --> 03:10:23,270
I have to find it myself.

3556
03:10:23,970 --> 03:10:24,650
There he is.

3557
03:10:27,590 --> 03:10:29,770
Hey, has something happened to Lord Sun Jian?

3558
03:10:30,010 --> 03:10:30,550
Where is he?

3559
03:10:31,110 --> 03:10:32,070
Where is he?

3560
03:10:32,470 --> 03:10:33,430
Wait, where is he?

3561
03:10:33,630 --> 03:10:36,130
Oh my god, don't tell me he's over there.

3562
03:10:36,230 --> 03:10:36,890
No, he's not.

3563
03:10:37,170 --> 03:10:37,690
I'm checking.

3564
03:10:37,990 --> 03:10:38,430
No, he's not.

3565
03:10:38,470 --> 03:10:38,970
He's over here.

3566
03:10:39,170 --> 03:10:41,270
Be careful when you venture outside of the city.

3567
03:10:42,470 --> 03:10:43,470
Where is he?

3568
03:10:43,910 --> 03:10:44,850
Where is he?

3569
03:10:45,170 --> 03:10:46,190
Where are you?

3570
03:10:47,390 --> 03:10:48,770
Where are you?

3571
03:10:51,150 --> 03:10:52,910
Where are you?

3572
03:10:55,290 --> 03:10:56,250
I'm trying...

3573
03:10:56,250 --> 03:10:56,810
Oh, there he is.

3574
03:10:56,890 --> 03:10:57,230
There he is.

3575
03:10:57,270 --> 03:10:57,650
There he is.

3576
03:10:57,690 --> 03:10:58,170
There he is.

3577
03:10:59,110 --> 03:10:59,430
Hello?

3578
03:11:00,130 --> 03:11:01,430
Hello, Zhuge Liang.

3579
03:11:03,670 --> 03:11:04,850
Oh, there you are.

3580
03:11:05,470 --> 03:11:06,390
Perfect timing.

3581
03:11:06,570 --> 03:11:07,990
I have a favor to ask for you.

3582
03:11:08,680 --> 03:11:11,810
In recent weeks, a piece of my fields has been shattered.

3583
03:11:12,170 --> 03:11:14,310
I want you to see that it's re-established.

3584
03:11:14,630 --> 03:11:15,970
I'll make it worth your while.

3585
03:11:16,190 --> 03:11:19,910
I'm not so brazen to ask a man to fight for free on my behalf.

3586
03:11:20,270 --> 03:11:21,570
Don't worry, I'll do anything for you.

3587
03:11:25,430 --> 03:11:26,930
No questions asked.

3588
03:11:32,450 --> 03:11:33,790
Don't worry, I'm here.

3589
03:11:34,890 --> 03:11:36,690
Don't worry, I got you!

3590
03:11:37,970 --> 03:11:39,470
For Zhuge Liang!

3591
03:11:41,570 --> 03:11:42,410
That's what you get.

3592
03:11:43,070 --> 03:11:44,530
You think you can kill me?

3593
03:11:46,890 --> 03:11:50,090
You don't understand how far I will go for him.

3594
03:11:51,350 --> 03:11:53,190
Okay, he's a little strong for a bandit.

3595
03:11:53,230 --> 03:11:53,790
Not gonna lie.

3596
03:11:53,910 --> 03:11:54,930
This guy should join an army.

3597
03:11:55,410 --> 03:11:57,550
This guy- This guy should join an army.

3598
03:11:57,670 --> 03:11:58,330
What the fuck?

3599
03:12:01,130 --> 03:12:02,990
How is he so strong?

3600
03:12:04,110 --> 03:12:07,530
You might as well be in the army with that fucking strength.

3601
03:12:09,630 --> 03:12:10,890
Oh wait, it's because he's a leader.

3602
03:12:10,890 --> 03:12:11,510
Whoops.

3603
03:12:11,930 --> 03:12:13,050
Okay, that makes sense.

3604
03:12:15,090 --> 03:12:17,770
I was like wondering like, what the fuck?

3605
03:12:19,330 --> 03:12:22,650
There's so much HP and so much like, uh...

3606
03:12:23,490 --> 03:12:24,390
Like so strong.

3607
03:12:24,470 --> 03:12:26,190
Alright, now I'm gonna kill the nerds.

3608
03:12:26,470 --> 03:12:28,250
Don't worry, it's nerd time.

3609
03:12:29,330 --> 03:12:30,530
Got the nerds now.

3610
03:12:32,170 --> 03:12:33,550
That's right, get over here.

3611
03:12:34,330 --> 03:12:35,030
Oh shit!

3612
03:12:35,670 --> 03:12:37,050
Oh my god, this nerd can fight back.

3613
03:12:38,250 --> 03:12:39,930
Wait, this nerd is also strong!

3614
03:12:40,010 --> 03:12:40,610
What the fuck?

3615
03:12:40,890 --> 03:12:43,670
Why are they feeding these- Bro, join an army!

3616
03:12:44,450 --> 03:12:46,010
What are you doing here?

3617
03:12:48,050 --> 03:12:50,070
This nerd is also so strong!

3618
03:12:52,370 --> 03:12:54,490
That's right, it's slowly heading towards you.

3619
03:12:54,950 --> 03:12:55,470
Oh fuck.

3620
03:12:57,630 --> 03:13:00,050
Oh my god, I'm barely doing any damage right now.

3621
03:13:02,330 --> 03:13:02,890
Nice.

3622
03:13:07,350 --> 03:13:08,730
Okay, one more move.

3623
03:13:08,810 --> 03:13:09,510
One more attack.

3624
03:13:10,150 --> 03:13:11,090
What the fuck?

3625
03:13:12,570 --> 03:13:12,810
Nice.

3626
03:13:14,330 --> 03:13:15,290
Parry this.

3627
03:13:17,230 --> 03:13:18,450
Okay, come on.

3628
03:13:18,630 --> 03:13:19,870
Just need one more hit.

3629
03:13:20,070 --> 03:13:20,810
Get over here!

3630
03:13:20,930 --> 03:13:22,150
Why are you running, nerd?

3631
03:13:23,210 --> 03:13:24,530
I have a locker!

3632
03:13:28,740 --> 03:13:29,180
Okay.

3633
03:13:30,100 --> 03:13:31,040
Get out!

3634
03:13:34,000 --> 03:13:35,060
Okay, one more.

3635
03:13:35,560 --> 03:13:36,900
One more guy to kill.

3636
03:13:39,520 --> 03:13:40,840
Alright, I had to...

3637
03:13:40,840 --> 03:13:42,340
Uh, a Judith?

3638
03:13:42,680 --> 03:13:43,740
The fuck does a Judith mean?

3639
03:13:46,600 --> 03:13:50,320
I don't know what Judith means- Oh my god, I did no damage to him.

3640
03:13:50,660 --> 03:13:51,320
At all.

3641
03:13:52,340 --> 03:13:52,840
It's okay.

3642
03:13:53,460 --> 03:13:54,160
That's fine.

3643
03:13:54,240 --> 03:13:56,840
The moment I get my Y move, it's over for you.

3644
03:13:57,640 --> 03:13:58,720
That's fucking right!

3645
03:13:59,320 --> 03:14:01,440
The most damage I'll do in this fight...

3646
03:14:02,700 --> 03:14:04,360
Is when I get to Y you.

3647
03:14:06,660 --> 03:14:07,580
And then do this too.

3648
03:14:09,060 --> 03:14:09,540
Nice.

3649
03:14:10,900 --> 03:14:11,820
Come on.

3650
03:14:12,180 --> 03:14:12,480
Oh my god.

3651
03:14:12,600 --> 03:14:13,440
I fucked up my parry.

3652
03:14:13,600 --> 03:14:14,200
God damn it.

3653
03:14:15,580 --> 03:14:16,300
It's fine.

3654
03:14:17,840 --> 03:14:18,620
Get out!

3655
03:14:21,700 --> 03:14:22,820
Oh my god!

3656
03:14:22,980 --> 03:14:23,360
Oh my god!

3657
03:14:23,440 --> 03:14:25,240
We're gonna be bond level one after this!

3658
03:14:25,460 --> 03:14:26,040
Oh my god!

3659
03:14:26,240 --> 03:14:26,840
Oh my god!

3660
03:14:26,900 --> 03:14:29,020
We're gonna be past acquaintances, guys!

3661
03:14:29,860 --> 03:14:30,320
Yippee!

3662
03:14:33,020 --> 03:14:36,740
He's gonna see me as not an acquaintance after that, guys!

3663
03:14:39,440 --> 03:14:40,160
What's this?

3664
03:14:42,100 --> 03:14:42,340
Uh...

3665
03:14:42,340 --> 03:14:43,120
Yeah, let's get more...

3666
03:14:43,120 --> 03:14:43,960
Oh wait, I need to get...

3667
03:14:43,960 --> 03:14:45,640
I don't have enough, so I'll just update this.

3668
03:14:47,620 --> 03:14:47,860
Friendship!

3669
03:14:52,700 --> 03:14:53,700
I don't know why I did the thing.

3670
03:14:54,300 --> 03:14:54,840
That helps.

3671
03:15:12,620 --> 03:15:13,900
Oh, he gives me three dollars?

3672
03:15:16,620 --> 03:15:18,380
Our bond has grown stronger!

3673
03:15:18,880 --> 03:15:19,920
Oh my god!

3674
03:15:20,600 --> 03:15:22,240
Our bond has grown stronger, guys!

3675
03:15:22,240 --> 03:15:23,680
Maybe he sent a letter?

3676
03:15:24,020 --> 03:15:24,960
Oh, he didn't.

3677
03:15:25,520 --> 03:15:27,020
He didn't send me a letter.

3678
03:15:29,940 --> 03:15:30,500
Guys...

3679
03:15:30,500 --> 03:15:32,960
He didn't send me a letter, guys.

3680
03:15:33,140 --> 03:15:33,500
Oh!

3681
03:15:33,700 --> 03:15:34,800
Wait, he's back here!

3682
03:15:35,440 --> 03:15:35,780
Oh!

3683
03:15:41,550 --> 03:15:42,110
Hello.

3684
03:15:57,510 --> 03:15:59,530
Of course, I'll try anything you want.

3685
03:16:00,710 --> 03:16:01,410
Oh.

3686
03:16:03,430 --> 03:16:04,190
Thanks.

3687
03:16:10,750 --> 03:16:11,510
Complaining?

3688
03:16:11,730 --> 03:16:12,810
I'll never complain.

3689
03:16:17,250 --> 03:16:19,490
Don't worry, I'll never complain.

3690
03:16:27,890 --> 03:16:31,530
There's nothing wrong with a quiet life of study...

3691
03:16:31,530 --> 03:16:32,130
I know, right?

3692
03:16:32,490 --> 03:16:33,810
There's nothing wrong with that.

3693
03:16:33,870 --> 03:16:35,030
Why are you judging him?

3694
03:16:36,070 --> 03:16:36,550
Yeah!

3695
03:16:37,570 --> 03:16:38,710
Stop moving, please.

3696
03:16:42,030 --> 03:16:42,510
Yeah,

3697
03:16:52,710 --> 03:16:53,550
let him farm!

3698
03:16:57,630 --> 03:16:58,990
STOP MOVING!

3699
03:17:01,790 --> 03:17:03,710
Using a farming manual?

3700
03:17:12,470 --> 03:17:14,710
Oh, you're so smart.

3701
03:17:14,890 --> 03:17:15,750
You're so smart.

3702
03:17:18,210 --> 03:17:19,950
You're so smart, Komi.

3703
03:17:27,550 --> 03:17:29,490
That's so true.

3704
03:17:40,050 --> 03:17:40,750
Aww.

3705
03:17:46,410 --> 03:17:47,270
I see.

3706
03:18:01,390 --> 03:18:02,110
He's...

3707
03:18:02,110 --> 03:18:03,730
He's satisfied!

3708
03:18:05,490 --> 03:18:06,510
He's enlightened!

3709
03:18:06,890 --> 03:18:08,210
Let him be a farmer!

3710
03:18:10,250 --> 03:18:14,890
Then he won't have to be disappointed in life for picking the wrong leader.

3711
03:18:18,330 --> 03:18:19,090
Oh, wait.

3712
03:18:19,130 --> 03:18:19,930
I don't want the mustache.

3713
03:18:46,760 --> 03:18:48,040
Oh, of course.

3714
03:18:48,680 --> 03:18:50,440
Of course, Pantone!

3715
03:18:50,640 --> 03:18:54,240
I will keep a lot of eyes on him.

3716
03:18:56,120 --> 03:18:59,880
Don't worry, he'll be safe under my guidance.

3717
03:19:00,920 --> 03:19:02,320
Don't you worry.

3718
03:19:03,220 --> 03:19:08,880
Goodness, to think both old friends and new acquaintances would show me such consideration.

3719
03:19:09,000 --> 03:19:09,760
NOOOOOOO!

3720
03:19:09,880 --> 03:19:11,420
Well then, guardian of peace...

3721
03:19:11,420 --> 03:19:14,400
He still sees me as an acquaintance!

3722
03:19:15,080 --> 03:19:15,840
NOOOOOOO!

3723
03:19:17,540 --> 03:19:23,040
After everything I've done, he doesn't see me as a friend!

3724
03:19:24,300 --> 03:19:28,540
I'm just an acquaintance to him!

3725
03:19:29,720 --> 03:19:31,560
Oh, it's the boy!

3726
03:19:32,680 --> 03:19:37,580
I'm not even a friend after everything I've done!

3727
03:19:38,160 --> 03:19:40,120
What's the point?

3728
03:19:45,840 --> 03:19:46,760
My

3729
03:19:52,840 --> 03:19:54,540
heart is broken.

3730
03:19:54,920 --> 03:19:57,840
I'll no longer feel anything anymore.

3731
03:19:58,820 --> 03:20:01,480
You got the acquaintance, though.

3732
03:20:04,660 --> 03:20:06,220
What's the point?

3733
03:20:06,440 --> 03:20:08,240
What's the point anymore?

3734
03:20:08,760 --> 03:20:11,040
I... I...

3735
03:20:11,040 --> 03:20:14,560
The one person I'm trying to chase...

3736
03:20:14,560 --> 03:20:17,340
Everybody else wants me...

3737
03:20:17,340 --> 03:20:21,060
But he doesn't even see me as a friend!

3738
03:20:21,840 --> 03:20:23,660
What's the point?

3739
03:20:24,480 --> 03:20:26,540
Calling it here...

3740
03:20:26,540 --> 03:20:31,220
He just wants to farm, don't he?

3741
03:20:31,300 --> 03:20:33,120
Just let him farm!

3742
03:20:33,560 --> 03:20:36,420
He's playing so hard to get!

3743
03:20:36,980 --> 03:20:39,520
Story as old as life!

3744
03:20:40,360 --> 03:20:40,820
Alright, guys.

3745
03:20:40,900 --> 03:20:42,320
I'm gonna call it here.

3746
03:20:44,000 --> 03:20:45,160
Get strategized!

3747
03:20:45,160 --> 03:20:47,100
Thank you, Lucy for chatting!

3748
03:20:47,200 --> 03:20:48,080
Thank you, thank you!

3749
03:20:48,540 --> 03:20:51,060
As always, everybody, stay hydrated!

3750
03:20:51,500 --> 03:20:52,260
Posture check!

3751
03:20:52,640 --> 03:20:55,640
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing!

3752
03:20:55,920 --> 03:20:58,280
And if you stay up for me, head to bed!

3753
03:20:58,340 --> 03:20:59,820
Cause you deserve it!

3754
03:20:59,920 --> 03:21:01,460
I'll see you guys next time, everybody!

3755
03:21:02,040 --> 03:21:03,200
Bye, guys!

3756
03:21:03,740 --> 03:21:07,280
I can't believe I got ejected!

3757
03:21:09,820 --> 03:21:10,520
Bye!
