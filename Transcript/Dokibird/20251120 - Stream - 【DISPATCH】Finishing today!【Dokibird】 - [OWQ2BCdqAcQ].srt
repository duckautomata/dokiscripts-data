1
00:05:34,910 --> 00:06:08,150
hello everybody aloha hello so i was like oh my god oh my god that's the third loop i gotta start now i was like oh it's the third loop oh no wait i was like chowing down my lunch my by the way it's okay it sounds very sad my microwave my microwaved reheated steak i got my leftover steak And I got reheated in a microwave.

2
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:12,430
I was like, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

3
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,290
Yeah, no, yeah, no, I know.

4
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,370
It sounds very sad.

5
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,750
Steak is steak.

6
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:28,790
So I was like, I'm trying to finish as fast as I could before like in the three loops.

7
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:30,830
Okay.

8
00:06:32,010 --> 00:07:46,890
Well, it's not really story time, but like, dad bit me because um he got a little too excited hi robert i'm robert again thank you for the super chat thank you thank you so um um i was trying to get the ball and then he like he like the ball was still in his mouth and he's like and then he first time he's ever broke skin um it's okay we got him rabies shots so it's okay uh my parents made sure that he had his rabies shot so don't worry guys i can still drink water um but like you know and then i consistently kept him uh kept him on his shots um but yes no he's tasted blood it's over uh yeah he started his rebellious phase um as a middle-aged dog um but yes no um so he like bit me on the inside like the you know the where the joy where the finger connects to the palm um he bit me there because i was trying to grab the ball and then um and then like he uh he was like no and you know he was like like like like like like that so like the obviously he thought he was still biting on his ball

9
00:07:46,890 --> 00:08:54,350
but he would he bit my finger charlie dad bit my finger charlie bit my finger oh my god i can't believe that was a fucking meme but where are we as a society uh um now i know they even super chat thank you today's my birthday as a barely functioning adult i accomplished a last year getting a job and thinking about college etc and hope i can accomplish more this year thank you for the super chat thank you thank you i hope you have a wonderful birthday and accomplish much more happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday dear nano happy birthday to you yay happy birthday also um i know like i know i'm like you guys are like please stop talking about my revivals but my revivals update um i talked to the organizers um and uh they might i don't know if they will but like i might have to off-roll so like i don't know if they are gonna do it but uh um because like we were i was like giving suggestions on how we can make it more fun and let's like try hard i was like oh you could

10
00:08:54,350 --> 00:09:34,190
put all the eternity plus players on off-roll i'm not playing take i swear i would fucking play would i don't care um if we have four dps i'm playing dps um so so um um and i said like oh i don't think it'd be we don't know what's gonna happen like because um i i said like um oh like an eternity player has so much more game sense map knowledge and skill wise over a celestial player I don't know you guys understand the gap between Celestial and Eternity.

11
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:41,970
It's actually like, no, like whenever a Celestial player gets accidentally gets into an Eternity lobby, like they get yelled at.

12
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:54,990
Like you could tell that they do not belong in that lobby because like the knowledge between a Celestial player and Eternity player is such a huge gap that like every, I know because I play Ranks.

13
00:09:54,990 --> 00:10:01,150
So every time a Celestial player sneaks into an eternity lobby, they always get yelled at, and they try to pick DPS.

14
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,290
They're like, no, get on support.

15
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:08,790
They're like, no, get on support.

16
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,610
You do not touch DPS.

17
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,310
Or like, get off of Tick.

18
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:12,970
No.

19
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:22,010
So, because they're asking me, like, do you think Celestial players should also be on their off roles?

20
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,970
And I was like, I said personally, I don't know.

21
00:10:24,990 --> 00:11:25,710
um because uh um because like i don't know i don't know these players but i do know that a celestial three player versus a celestial one player is also a huge gap between knowledge because you know celestial one is closer to eternity versus celestial three who's closer to grandmaster um especially if that's their peak if they piece celestial three then like i know you've never like hit that elo where you could play with the eternity players or like you know sometimes you do but you know you don't play often with eternity players so um so like you know i'm trying to help them figure out you know as someone that organized tournaments before i'm trying to help them especially like for hero shooters because i think hero shooters is the hardest thing to um is the hardest thing to figure out in terms of like how do you balance a hero shooter when all roles are different because it's like 70 support players in this tournament um so so how do you balance when 70% of the people you have in this

22
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:30,870
tournament are essentially support players and we have two tier tank players.

23
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,490
There's only two tank players.

24
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:37,670
Like they can other support players can off-roll as tank players, but like it's still an off-roll.

25
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:48,790
So it's like more so of like, um, how, how do you, how do you balance a tournament when it's 70% support players, 1% tank players, and the rest it's DPS.

26
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:56,650
So it's very, like there are, no, they have like, you know, like second role, like, you know, like, what is your main role and what is your second role?

27
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:04,910
Obviously, your second role will never be as good as your first role because when you're playing your second role, you're essentially flexing, you know?

28
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,570
So they're asking me about that.

29
00:12:11,670 --> 00:13:23,610
And I said, I told them personally, I don't know I think for sure um to make it more fun um each turn players should off roll and I said I don't you know how it's like I hope I don't off roll but if I have to to make this tournament more fun for everyone I will even though like I would love to play support um but I you know I understand that like you know I will take it for the team and I'll off roll just so everyone can a more fun time because there's no reason why they want me to offer because i told them yesterday i did my placement matches i did all 10 of my placements matches and um because i was like i got it you know i have the practice for the tournament um because everyone was like oh it's for fun the prize money is 7.5k for first place um and um um anyway so i obviously i didn't try out the new season yet and I was like oh okay I should really see what the new meta is and like see how to play in this new Elo and also try out Gambit because in my head I was like um in my head

30
00:13:23,610 --> 00:14:32,910
I was like the only way I can carry my team as a support play is I have to play Gambit because Gambit a lot of people are like Gambit is the cure code no Gambit is the honor of of Marvel rivals um because you don't use your cleanse the only thing you do on gambit this is what i've learned because i actually asked my pro friends um how to play gambit like you know and then like all them like you have to play like sipe who is currently who is like rank one support in the world and sipe got rank one on gambit and basically everyone was like um you barely use your cleanse because what you do is you have to use your anti-heal every like all the time it's all about anti-heal so he is basically the honor of marvel rivals because you're just and like and then my friends they're like um no dps can 1v1 a gambit anymore because his util is so good anti-heal means when you use it when he use it and it's like a it's like a hit scan anti-heal too it's not even projectile the anti-heal is so broken

31
00:14:32,910 --> 00:15:30,350
it does damage and it does anti and you have to I could technically spam two and then the supports are dead so um so he's so fucking strong and his dash and his dash is so good too so I um so I did all my placement matches and um yeah he can heal while using his mobility too so Gabbit is very fucking strong right now and it's like my friends were like who are pros are like no TPS player can confidently 1v1 um gambit and gambit anymore because he's that like that good of a support and then he was like uh he's like basically he can kill all the other supports um even if like if he has like a if he he could pick off any support player on the enemy team with his anti-heal and his like left click And so,

32
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,410
so I was like, that can't be true.

33
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:45,490
There's no way that, uh, uh, I was like, there's no way he's that good.

34
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:49,010
Like, there's, like, oh my gosh, like, you know, I was like in denial.

35
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:57,130
So then I was like, I'm gonna go, you know, I'm gonna go do my placement matches and then see how, how it's gonna be like.

36
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:16,050
like i think this is my second placement match and i need you guys to know this was in a lobby of gm1s and celestial players and top 500 is celestial 2 right now

37
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:27,990
look at this look at this stat line very carefully

38
00:16:36,630 --> 00:17:03,050
and also look at my final it's i was it was basically a one v one i literally you win if i went with winning one v ones against spider-man and iron fist and and i've only I've only had one loss on Gambit.

39
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:13,090
And whenever I got to play Gambit, I've only had one loss on Gambit when I had to.

40
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,990
And I played six games on him.

41
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:21,210
And so, yeah, so he's like, he's very strong.

42
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:26,290
But Gambit is the only character I believe.

43
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:26,930
And Mantis.

44
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,210
It's Gambit and Mantis that you can use.

45
00:17:29,330 --> 00:18:34,950
to no they had a gambit but he swapped off because he was shit like the enemy team had a gambit but they swapped off because obviously he wasn't doing as good as the other gambit so it's not like so if i could do that in a high elo lobby imagine what i could do in like the vtuber tournament as gambit like he is the only character i believe that can that can confidently i can say can actually 1v4 a team if i just take off angles and we play triple support so i was telling them i was just like oh um i feel like you know if i was on gap like maybe they'll just ban gambit but i was just like if i was gonna get gambit this is not gonna be fun also luna is hard not meta luna is trash right And then I am confident because me on Gambit,

46
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:47,510
I can bully the lower ELO supports easily or the lower ELO DPS players because I was already bullying the DPS players that were in my ELO.

47
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,090
That's the thing.

48
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:57,230
I was already bullying the support and DPS players in my ELO.

49
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:22,310
so yeah like if i had to go against people who are lower elo than me i think i couldn't like it would not be fun for them so so um so they were like yeah we might we will need you to off off roll and i was like i'm fine with that like i was even saying like i don't think it's fair you put me on gambit

50
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:44,510
I was just like, um, I was just like, oh, I, I also, I, like, I even, I was like, I don't think it's fair if you put me in Gambit, like, because, like, Gambit is, like, a DPS now, and if I run triple support, my two supports can just pocket the rest of the team,

51
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:49,550
and I can just take off angle and play, like, a triple, like, a second DPS or a third DPS.

52
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:55,090
Like, um, like, I could literally just play as a second DPS, and, like, his util is so fucking broken.

53
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:05,650
healing dps um so he is a self-healing dps which is already pretty scary with anti-heal

54
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:53,790
so so i was like i just feel i feel like i like if at that point everyone in eternity plus maybe we need to off roll i know i'm like you know maybe like i get shit on as gambit um leon if i can play gambit i just don't i don't i'm just like thinking like i don't think it's playing Gambit and all I do is just like like use all my util to kill their supports because like that's what I was literally doing like here in this game so I had literally I only lost one game on Gambit there all the times I got to play him and um and so like there is potentially a chance that um I'm gonna have to off-roll um just to make it fair for everyone

55
00:20:58,650 --> 00:22:13,220
um um what if the top five and gps offer us to gambit then i'm gonna ban gambit i have first ban we all if we all have first ban i'll just ban gambit i'm not fucking giving them gambit like but if everyone knows that i'm gonna play gambit then gambit's just gonna be permaband for me as well and then like and then like what the fuck do i do like i can't hard carry as anything else but mantis like and even then my mantis is not that good compared to like because i still like i hate aiming with mantis i don't know how to fully aim with mantis because um because like he's uh he's like hard to penny is so strong but not really um there's only penny players that play penny she's still not that she's still not the strongest tanks in rivals um so that's like off topic but I had to talk also they were like if we off-role will you be captain again and I didn't respond back you want to give me the captain title because I guess it looks better if like you know team dokeybird because they want like

56
00:22:13,220 --> 00:23:24,820
because like the thing is the captains um they're not all the high-ranked players it's the play it's like basically the most well-known vtubers are captains so so like you know like whoever is like more like you know the most well-known vtubers they give the captain spot to so they they want us to like be the face of the team like you know be the face so like you know oh look it's this team this team this team and yeah it's for the publicity so they're like they're like would you be captain get we implement the off-roll thing and i'm just like my gosh i really don't want to be captain i i'm okay with being captain if I get to pick my team but like I just feel weird about being captain um um no it's pre-assigned the entire all the teams are pre-assigned as well and apparently I don't know if this is true I don't know I got a little confused but it was supposed to be like uh oh um it's supposed to be an all na tournament and then apparently uh but it wasn't that clear so some eu player

57
00:23:24,820 --> 00:24:18,800
players sneaked in so then they were like oh sorry we have to find na players to replace you guys because you're not supposed to be in this tournament na only um so like they can't announce anything yet because they have to um they have to find like na replacements i don't know didn't realize it was i think i think it was in the rule oh yeah i think it was it was in the rules that it was supposed in the forum it was supposed to be na but like um they didn't fully check the i guess like they didn't fully check it um but so that's why like nothing is real it's region locked nothing is fully yeah it wasn't said it was said in the forum that it was na only but some eu players applied for it so they have to like be like sorry guys it sucks it sucks but But,

58
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:37,220
you know, if it's, I think it has to do with, like, prizes as well, because I know, like, some prizes, like, you know, like, transferring prize money and everything, it has to, like, regarding, like, guidelines on how to transfer prize money, especially for taxes and everything,

59
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:48,080
it makes sense to keep it within NA, because it gets more complicated, if you're outside of NA, and you have to, like, you have to fill in, like, special tax forms and stuff to receive prizes.

60
00:24:48,100 --> 00:25:24,820
money and everything hmm so like so like because of that that's why i'm not surprised it's NA locked because you don't want to deal with the headaches of like the headache of trying to figure out um tax money like how to you know fill out the tax forms for the prize money in itself so yeah so i don't know when teams would be announced i don't know if the special rules are going to be implemented i did say maybe test out the off-roll rule just in case like do like like a practice match to see if teams are not balanced or not because I don't know.

61
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:29,940
Like it's so I was looking at the forum and even I was like, how do you balance this?

62
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:40,420
Like I'm so glad I don't have to handle the balancing for this because looking at that forum, I was just like, oh my God, how do you balance this?

63
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:44,800
Because like you guys might be thinking like, oh, why don't you just find players for all roles.

64
00:25:44,880 --> 00:27:01,940
The thing is, um, to run a tournament, also have to find people that have the viewership as well to prop up the numbers because you know all rivals all rivals want is to make sure that um their game is advertised to as many people as possible so um so because of that like they want to make it balanced to the point where like you know the bigger streamers there's also enough balance of the bigger streamers but you know the bigger streamers play support you know like all the streamers majority of the streamers that are that have the numbers and the um and the skill level in the different skill level are support players so so you know that's what can you do so that's what a tournament has a lot of support players and it's i i do you know i don't even know how the fuck they balance this it's so hard i was literally looking at you asking my opinion being like being like what do you do you think do you think we should give celestia off roll and i was like i don't know i know you turn any

65
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:09,440
plus shit off roll i know i damn know for sure you turn any plus shit off roll because i was

66
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:40,240
um so yeah anyway ow i clapped and then hit the hit the bite wound um anyway so that is the marvel rivals update for today um oh yeah one more thing um i bump i when i was playing off stream i bumped you know i was bumping to other like streamers and pro players and one streamer slash pro was like

67
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,120
YokeyBrain, why aren't you streaming?

68
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:50,400
Like, they typed in the chat, in the match chat while we were in game.

69
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,920
And then I replied back, he was on the enemy team.

70
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,940
I replied back, I don't know.

71
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,400
Why wasn't I nominated?

72
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,580
I know, that's so fucking petty.

73
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,420
But I was like, bro, it's off stream.

74
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,920
It's off stream at 2 in the morning.

75
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,180
I can see where the fuck I want.

76
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,100
I'm so salty

77
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:40,900
I know that's it's so fanny I know that's like bro I'm fucking gonna play hot like bro I have nothing no there's no whatsoever I I gain nothing anymore and then they're just like and then they were like oh dot dot dot

78
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,920
I'm valid as fuck

79
00:28:54,940 --> 00:29:15,580
But like I have nothing to, yeah There's nothing to lose But anyway, I just didn't want to style it I was trying to practice for I was just wanting to do my place in matches Um Uh And oh yeah And I placed Celestial 3 Um for those who are wondering is Celestial 2 and I play Celestial 3.

80
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,380
Thanks, Gambit.

81
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,640
Shout out to you, Gambit.

82
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:25,500
And for those who are wondering, like, wait, if Gambit's so strong, why isn't he bad?

83
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:28,540
Because other characters are also very strong and scary.

84
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:39,060
Daredevil is so strong and the must bands, what I've learned is Daredevil, SILOC, Emma, Hella.

85
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,840
These are, like, the four top bands at the moment.

86
00:29:43,080 --> 00:30:17,320
So, like um so these are the four that everyone sort of always bans which i've noticed is daredevil sidlock emma hella because they're so scary there there's too many strong heroes because gambit um he um the thing is to play gambit well is that you have to have the other support also doing a lot of healing so the gambit has to rely on the other support to be able to do whatever the fuck he wants to do and it's it's literally a gambit yeah it's a gamble to play gambit because there's also a lot of shitty gambit players

87
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:46,360
gambit um gambit there's a lot of very shitty gambit players and they all a lot of people think you have to be a heal like think that like um oh it's do your dps on gambit or you be a heal bot no you have to balance between the two you have to balance between the two but you use your Your card ability to do anti-heal.

88
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:47,680
That's literally it.

89
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,580
You barely use it for anything else.

90
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,260
Like, you don't really use it for healing.

91
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,260
You don't use it for cleanse.

92
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,240
You just use it for mostly anti-heal.

93
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,860
Cleanse is mostly for Bucky alt or Groot alt.

94
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,540
That's it.

95
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,960
But everything else, it's like, you know, you use it for anti.

96
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,040
Anyway, let's play Dispatch.

97
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:02,460
I don't know.

98
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,740
Okay, I forgot to ask.

99
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,260
All right.

100
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,040
Okay, so we have Soundgap.

101
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:09,640
Sorry, Soundgap.

102
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,980
I know you waited 30 minutes.

103
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,160
I forgot to save my Soundgap.

104
00:31:13,240 --> 00:32:42,960

105
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:51,020
is like that sometimes you just live the life where you have bad things happen to you and i'm robert

107
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,680
Alright, let's go.

108
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,600
It's Robert time.

109
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,940
It's time to be Robert for another day.

110
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:35,590
If I wanted to bat him to stop playing the game and live my life, the thing is, I don't know what my choices are going to make me, so I got to live with my consequences.

111
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:38,250
If I make a bad choice, fuck me.

112
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:40,110
There's no going back.

113
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,020
I don't purposely...

114
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:59,300
playing knowing where my choices end up to i play pick choices that i think is pretty funny because like i'm not gonna make these choices these bad choices in real life

115
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:20,120
bro you missed the 3 a.m tacos you're sick as hell This was 3 a.m.

116
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:20,360
Taco.

117
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,780
And despite all of that.

118
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,700
That's nice.

119
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,800
I guess that was.

120
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,860
Sounds like my local Taco Bell.

121
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,520
Engaging protocols.

122
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,580
Game audio can be raised.

123
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,080
Sound guy.

124
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,120
What do you think?

125
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,420
It's fine.

126
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,840
I'll just, I'll raise it just in case.

127
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:46,860
All right.

128
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,480
I raised it a little bit.

129
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:49,380
Now.

130
00:34:58,450 --> 00:34:59,810
All reading super stable.

131
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,790
Here we go.

132
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:03,170
Oh?

133
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:04,870
I got a flex.

134
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:07,230
Wait, no superhero pose.

135
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:09,090
All right.

136
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,550
Ready for lunch.

137
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:11,590
Roger that.

138
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:16,010
Gotta be a superhero, even though I'm retired.

139
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:19,650
I'm going to eat my cold microwave steak now.

140
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,470
Oh, my girlfriend here is to support me.

141
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:27,350
Did I do it?

142
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:30,910
That's the superhero pose.

143
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:34,290
pose not the landing one bro the landing one would have been cooler

144
00:35:40,470 --> 00:36:00,370
bro you know like the spider-man one or like the superman pose i thought the same too but i think the purple is a nice touch what smoke what oh that's not supposed to happen yeah i was like where did the purple smoke come from bro

145
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,580
my future boyfriend.

146
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,260
Don't worry, I know I have two more episodes, so I can't be dying.

147
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:23,880
I'm not...

148
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,100
I know he's gonna live, because there's still episode 7 and 8.

149
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,160
Oh, shit!

150
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,960
Don't worry, I live this, right?

151
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,160
I'm just gonna be in the hospital.

152
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:46,320
The last two episodes are just a blank screen.

153
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,720
I'm like, in the last two episodes is me in purgatory.

154
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,140
Yeah, see, I knew I was alive.

155
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,380
Oh, look, there's my badass dog.

156
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,500
I love you.

157
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,680
Wait, he got more injured than me?

158
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,980
How long was I out?

159
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:18,520
Yeah.

160
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,000
About 14, 15 hours, I think.

161
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:24,980
Bro, he broke his arm and has a concussion and I just have like...

162
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:26,220
Yeah.

163
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,460
It's over, brother.

164
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,600
I cannot recreate the Astral Pulse.

165
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:35,480
What?

166
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,280
Too much power.

167
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,000
Too small size.

168
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,380
We'll just make it bigger.

169
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,860
No pulse mean I can't make the man Mecca.

170
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,260
I'm not good enough, bro.

171
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,220
No!

172
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,260
No, don't say that!

173
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,640
I must bring down the whole team.

174
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,840
I believe in you.

175
00:37:51,860 --> 00:38:19,000
you let's get everybody blowed up hey listen bro i believe as long as i believe in you you can do anything it's not a literally game brother this real life no oh i should have been like just a minor setback you did your best i can't ask for anything else thank you

176
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,400
Yeah, fisted.

177
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,240
I heard that big bastard crying in the bathroom.

178
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,120
Makes it hard to shit when someone's doing that next to you, you know?

179
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,540
Pretty distracting.

180
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,200
No.

181
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:41,920
Everyone else okay?

182
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,580
And Vizzy girl?

183
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:44,300
Fine.

184
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,220
One thing she's good at is disappearing when people get hurt.

185
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,600
What's your deal with her?

186
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:54,160
You give everyone shit, but it always seems extra with Vizzy.

187
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:55,780
She's a liability.

188
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,200
And one of us needs to be objective.

189
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,290
when it's clear something's going on between the two of you.

190
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:02,740
Don't think I don't see it.

191
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,880
Do you think she likes me?

192
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,520
Wait, do you think she likes me, bro?

193
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:13,080
She's like, she's like, she's bad, bro.

194
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,700
And like, bro, you think she likes me?

195
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,660
Can you ask her in PE?

196
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,220
Maybe put a note in her locker for me?

197
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,600
Ha, ha, motherfucker.

198
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,340
But this little bitch you're doing?

199
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,800
Do you think I have a shot?

200
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,460
Because you wouldn't be joking like this if you didn't have a thing for.

201
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,040
Look.

202
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,500
Just be careful, kid.

203
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,380
Some people did black holes.

204
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,320
You reach out to help them, and they just suck you in and do whatever the fuck black holes do.

205
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:37,840
I don't know.

206
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:38,940
They fuck you up.

207
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,500
Bro, did she fuck me up, bro?

208
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:47,140
Your new look screams I know some science shit, so I was with you.

209
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,380
Oh, we can bring it a little more.

210
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:51,780
Okay, let me double check the audio real quick.

211
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:52,340
Sound.

212
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,200
Yeah, we're already up the sound a lot.

213
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,860
So we'll just up a little more here.

214
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:11,800
up with it a little more i'm gonna take the day off no really bro i'm fine she's gonna me up bro just throw say no more in the infirmary think about that i'll move it over

215
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:32,250
it's like she he's trying to warn me about her and i'm like yo you think she likes me he's like bro there's so many red flags and i'm like she actually likes me enhanced proceed with What are you doing up?

216
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:34,870
Turns out I'm completely fine.

217
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:40,790
Just sort of time traveled several hours into the future where I feel pretty rested.

218
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:41,810
Cool, yeah.

219
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,390
That happens to me every night.

220
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:44,610
Wish I could say the same.

221
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:46,350
How's your ship going?

222
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:48,150
Oh wait, she takes my ship?

223
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:49,470
Challenging.

224
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:52,730
Made worse by all the enhanced villains we're dealing with lately.

225
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:53,770
Enhanced villains?

226
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:54,170
Oh!

227
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:57,150
The Xbox ring.

228
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:03,690
Oh, yeah, I know she had to handle his, her, her ex, too.

229
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:05,930
Give us some time.

230
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:11,710
Roy's a little down, but I'm sure we can come up with alternate power sources.

231
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:16,730
Hey, really looking forward to tonight.

232
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:17,910
Perfect timing.

233
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:19,550
Yeah, same.

234
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:30,470
Also, like, Invisible Girl is so smart to fuck the dispatcher, because that means she'll get more jobs and get sent on the easier job.

235
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,270
Congrats on that.

236
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:33,650
Oh, they got me a gift.

237
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:35,510
She's so smart.

238
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:37,390
Wait, I have to just...

239
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:37,530
Okay.

240
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:43,830
I need someone to wait patiently in the long line for the game drop.

241
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:46,010
Blend in with the line to not look like...

242
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:47,010
I think depression.

243
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:47,990
Oh, wait.

244
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:49,350
No, that should be...

245
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:58,590
As one of the most well-known game reviewers here, Moist Zoner would be the perfect one to send in.

246
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:00,530
I need to...

247
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:30,710

249
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:32,530
Okay, here you go.

250
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,510
Wait, it's a fucking tiger?

251
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:35,790
It's like a goddamn NPC.

252
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:37,030
This is you talking, Robert.

253
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:40,150
Taco shit.

254
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:41,010
Oh, I knew it.

255
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:43,690
Yeah, because Golem's really good with animals.

256
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:45,590
Yeah, we did it.

257
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:47,790
Yeah, let's go with that.

258
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:50,510
I had taco shits.

259
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:53,330
This does many special jobs, but they're not.

260
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:55,290
Didn't you say you could handle spicy food?

261
00:42:55,830 --> 00:43:00,410
Yes, which is why this doesn't make sense as an excuse.

Oh my gosh, that's a huge responsibility.

265
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:38,790
I brought overall up.

266
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:43,570
Also forgot how to hack, too.

267
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:45,090
So this is going to be interesting.

268
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:49,930
Oh.

269
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:51,990
Woo!

270
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:57,550
Oh, okay.

271
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:00,150
Okay.

272
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:01,650
Okay, this is bad.

273
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:03,850
I gotta figure this out.

274
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:09,600
Woo!

275
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:11,920

Oh, wait.

00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:17,000
Okay, I can kill him.

279
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,300
Okay, yeah, I forgot about that.

280
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:19,920
I forgot I could kill him.

281
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:20,860
Okay.

282
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,740
Guys, I hope you remembered that because I did it.

283
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:26,800
Alright.

284
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:30,000

287
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:36,520
That's the best way to take care of it.

288
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,340
Never meet your heroes.

289
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:46,240
Especially when they're also especially when they're very fucking depressed, dude.

290
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,300
No, that's true.

291
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,240
And Purve, I'll just send her.

292
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,060
You know what I'll send.

293
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:54,040
Wait, who just said Phenomenon?

294
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,500
We'll give him a reality check.

296
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:06,840
Now he'll really never meet him.

297
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,720
He'll never get his meet and greet.

298
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,220
Also, thank you for the ride.

299
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:10,600
Thank you.

300
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:11,440
Thank you.

301
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:15,480
Alright, investigate the supposed hauntish house.

302
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:18,460
Reassure the homeowner that she is not cursed.

303
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:19,180
Um.

304
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,500
Oh, by sending in the devil.

305
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:22,520
You know what?

306
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,200
Who is she friends with again?

307
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:27,680
Who is Melavola friends with?

308
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,160
I remember it says in the...

309
00:48:31,600 --> 00:49:30,880
oh here sonar all right the best way the best way to investigate a haunted house um and to reassure the homeowner that is not cursed is to send in a fucking monster bat and a literal demon and be like don't worry ghosts aren't real but demons are well ghosts are bullshit but spirits are confirm we are hosting a little roast in the mayor and he came in it's a roast but be smart we don't want to be okay be smart oh i don't have okay prism is smart look at here there you go what's it going to be this and what could go wrong i don't write my own jokes can't we hire somebody there's a full-on gang war happening in the warehouse looks like a gang war red ring Lieutenant Prigoz understopped the gangs from Escalade.

310
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:32,900
Okay, so we have White Man.

311
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:34,320
And then we can have her.

312
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:34,860
You know what?

313
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:35,660
Let's get all of them.

314
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:36,980
Put everybody in.

315
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:40,700
It would be a shame if I had more stuff pops up.

316
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,180
Yeah, fight ghosts with demons.

317
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:46,280
We all know.

318
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,460
In rock, in rock, paper, scissors.

319
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:50,720
Oh, phone a friend.

320
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:51,280
There we go.

321
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:56,860
I knew the vibes were off this morning, but I couldn't tell if it was divorce vibes or shitty commute traffic vibes.

322
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,680
Hey, maybe she's not going to hell after all.

323
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,180
Marrying someone can send you to hell.

324
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:02,680
Yeah, what?

325
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,200
Yeah, but only if you marry a billionaire.

326
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:04,740
Ha!

327
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:06,160
Why?

328
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:07,300
But why?

329
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,260
Maybe the billionaire is the good person.

330
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:15,520
He made his money via very legal means.

331
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,620
Increasing success chance when...

332
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:18,220
Oh, nice.

333
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,040
I reached max synergy.

334
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:20,940
Let's go.

335
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:23,680
They sold their souls.

336
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:26,980
Maybe, but what if they do a lot of charity?

337
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:31,760
The faction of light needs your help to overtake the faction of darkness.

338
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:34,820
How did they role play as the hero that was foretold?

339
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:38,060
Okay, so it's just role play.

340
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:43,160
It stands for live action role play, but it's not a sex thing.

341
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,320
I mean, it can be.

342
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:46,420
People dressing up and playing pretend type shit.

343
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:47,760
Still sounds like a sex thing.

344
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:49,160
It can be.

345
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:50,840
You just heard about those conventions?

346
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:21,200
everyone oh this is bad everyone's resting i mean oh this is very bad assistance his line of delivery bots appear to have gained sentience and are attacking the city all right we have to take it here out of resting who would be the best to take it here uh okay so i was due i wait a All right,

347
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,160
here we go.

348
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:24,520
Role play as a hero that has foretold.

349
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,840
I'll assume...

350
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:29,140
I'm gonna take...

351
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:32,900
I don't know if I should take Sonar and put it...

352
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,420
Yeah, I'll take Sonar and put him in here.

353
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:35,000
That's good.

354
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:36,140
I know you're very...

355
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:36,880
You were...

356
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,700
You literally was in the Hunger Games.

357
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:39,400
You're gonna...

358
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,380
He was in the Hunger Games, guys.

359
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:49,180
Wait, I gotta check this.

360
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,400
Okay, we'll check this first.

361
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:53,600
Okay, nice.

362
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:56,040
Yeah, I think it was a little overkill, but yeah.

363
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:03,100
He's a very successful actor, so I think he's fine.

364
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:09,120
Alright, I swear to God, if it somehow goes all the way here.

365
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:10,120
Neh!

366
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:11,280
Okay.

367
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,080
Oh, shit, we have a lot of upgrades.

368
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,000
Okay, skill point.

369
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:18,780
We'll put...

370
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:19,060
You know what?

371
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:19,460
We'll put...

372
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:21,740
We need more intelligent people in our team.

373
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,120
I can't keep looking, putting it all...

374
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:29,240
I think we have enough combat and mobility.

375
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,660
But what if we put one more in combat?

376
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,120
Just what if, guys?

377
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,340
Okay, we'll put him in.

378
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,480
He's our all-rounder.

379
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:45,020
Okay.

380
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:46,120
Oh, shit.

381
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,980
Okay, we have to send someone here.

382
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,480
Stopped him before.

383
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,660
Okay, we'll do these two.

384
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:52,280

I mean, that's fine, right?

393
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:04,960

I think we're fine.

397
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:12,200
Alright.

398
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,140
Melt the ice, break the ice.

399
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:16,360
Let me fry them.

400
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,400
The ice, I mean.

401
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,200
God damn it.

402
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:18,600
Okay.

403
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:22,040
Send Flambay to the frost the bank without injuring the civilians.

404
00:54:22,500 --> 00:55:47,320
okay i should have seen oh i should have oh whoops sorry we can't risk you burning traps um oh i should have noticed that before before flambay went out it's okay i have time 18 blazer's doing a speech over the college that's awkward one of you will be there to hear it all right uh we can wait a little bit not we don't have to oh well choose the class to lead oh a bard okay we have enough we do let's lead us a bard can't be that bad oh oh thank god i was gonna say i thought it was oh thank god i was like i have a i know i have 20 speech right now it's barred definitely i know because sonar went to harvard time to freak some out all right oh shit oh wait we're five yeah i I think I said yeah I definitely it was a little bit of overkill workday and I thought he could try using the forklift another certified forklift driver dropped entire shipment to recover what you can okay first off let us um you know what we'll put you on mobility um everyone keeps yelling at me to stop enhancing my

combat uh bro the kid wasn't forklift certified No fucking way.

406
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:57,220
He wants them destroyed, but I think there's a way to reprogram them.

407
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:01,640
Patch up to the retreating, then reprogram them to not attack humans.

408
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,520
Well, oh my gosh, we need someone smart, but we don't have that.

409
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:05,500
Fuck.

410
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:06,200
Oh, fuck.

411
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:07,200
Guys, why?

412
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:07,960
Oh, fuck.

413
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:09,620
Why did I invest in combat?

414
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:10,180
Why?

415
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,280
There's some activity down in the sewers.

416
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:15,920
My tenants are getting uneasy.

417
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:17,460
Can you folks look into it?

418
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,580
Oh, this is bad.

419
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,720
I don't think Flambé is coming back in time.

420
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:25,100
It's okay.

421
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,740
I have depression, man.

422
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,800
And, um, be careful.

423
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:34,580
These two.

424
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,600
Wait, the odd couple.

425
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:37,600
It should be fine.

426
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,820
You aren't my typical romantic companions.

427
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:40,980
It should be fine.

428
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,320
I could be persuaded.

429
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:44,020
We should be okay.

430
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:44,620
You know what?

431
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:48,180
No, we have to keep one of you guys up for the other task because...

432
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:49,960
Oh, this is bad.

433
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,220
This is...

434
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:52,480
No, he's not.

Yes.

437
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:32,800
Yes.

438
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:34,520
Some people are gonna...

439
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:34,840
Alright.

440
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:38,200
Sometimes things happen, okay.

441
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:40,350
Sometimes things happen.

442
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:42,000
I got it.

443
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:43,200
Okay.

444
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:46,400
We have to accept that thing.

445
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:47,720
Oh shit.

446
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:49,520
We can't save everyone.

447
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,040
The best towels.

448
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:52,220
I know.

449
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,280
I stole a few.

450
00:57:55,360 --> 00:58:23,280
project maybe violence wasn't the answer I can't believe violence was not the answer I'm gonna send his or her ex-boyfriend to this uh hero training all right investigate the reports oh we'll send you two that'll be fine oh sure no like I thought you said you had it it had no one no one has that So happily gave up water boy.

451
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:24,560

452
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:25,080
Oh, thank God.

453
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,020
I've got the booze.

454
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:31,500
Um, yes, I gave up water boy for depression, man.

455
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:36,760
Because I will be happy to assist in transport if someone wished to fly over.

456
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:44,160
Because I can send him to his ex's, uh, to his ex's lesson to make it even more awkward.

457
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:46,840
Like, you don't get to do that with water boy.

458
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,260
Alright, let's see.

459
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:50,760
Okay, what I've learned.

460
00:58:51,280 --> 00:59:15,500

461
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:18,900
See, you don't need fire.

462
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:22,380
All we get to do, we can just punch people.

463
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:23,740
That's fine.

464
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:27,480
But we'll have him learn something.

465
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:29,400
We might as well.

466
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,260
We don't have anything else to do.

467
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:33,300
How are you depressed?

468
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:35,060
We got a job well done.

469
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,660
How is your depression?

470
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:38,520
Have you just not been...

471
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:42,060
Have you thought about not being sad?

472
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,420
I'm a bad person.

473
00:59:45,740 --> 01:00:08,180
just alright twice was set to max and removes rest time after stats dropped to one wait that's good that means less combat and reduce call completion if after it fails a third he is down yeah that's fine there's no way he's gonna fail again easy don't be sad

474
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:17,300
alright everything is fine oh I didn't get the bonus oh I did get the bonus.

475
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:19,340
Yay.

476
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,480
I'm sure we don't work on commission.

477
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:23,560
We did it.

478
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,500
I said my chemistry, people.

479
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:28,840
Oh, sonar require.

480
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,360
Engage in a diplomatic relations.

481
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:33,600
Win them over with...

482
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:36,700
Diplomatic has to be with, like, your brain, right?

483
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:37,920
And I maxed that out.

484
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:42,700
Oh, thank God.

485
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:44,460
I was gonna say, thank God.

486
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:47,120
I better max it out.

487
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:50,380
Yeah, we're friends with the MUD people!

488
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,140
Let's go!

489
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:52,980

490
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:56,460
MUD people, MUD people.

491
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:59,380
Alright, let's have more smart people in our team.

492
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:02,120
Let's have a more combat.

493
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,980
Guys, what do we put in more combat?

494
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,300
Do you think I'll be a bad idea?

495
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:11,820
Yeah!

496
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:14,080
We're friends now!

497
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:18,120
I already have my max career, so it doesn't really matter.

498
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:34,520
matter how many I failed now like I can't get like super promoted because I you guys won't let me fuck the boss I could have had a I could have been promoted and a raise if you guys let me fuck my boss

499
01:01:51,620 --> 01:02:24,560
Then why didn't you because we had a democratic vote and i ain't a corrupted leader yet You know, it feels like for the first time for that day i felt i felt kind today Which i'm sure you would appreciate been nice that we get to spend more time together right the team's more important the team might fuck up for a while the people's choice they're gonna get good that day i felt exceptionally bad than i ever could alone

500
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:37,680
but just when i feel like i got a handle on it got it figured out i think about chase and my dad and Shroud.

501
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:40,400
Then I get all fucked up.

502
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:42,420
You know what I'm saying, beef?

503
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:43,580
You know what I mean.

504
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:45,480
He's my emotional support animal.

505
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:49,200
Yeah, exactly.

506
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:52,200
See, this is why I appreciate her talks.

507
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,020
Wait, what the fuck?

508
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:04,160
Oh, hi.

509
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:06,140
What are you doing here?

510
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:06,800
Are you decent?

511
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:09,020
Definitely a house that needs some warmth.

512
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:09,380
Wait.

513
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:11,960
I'm in my underwear.

514
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:14,420
I am in my underwear.

515
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:15,680
What are you guys doing here?

516
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:16,680
I can see you.

517
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:18,680
I was joking when I asked if you're decent.

518
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:19,680
I know.

519
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:23,400
I just need you to know that I know how I look right now.

520
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:23,800
All right.

521
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:24,840
That rubs out, by the way.

522
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,860
You just have to put a little muscle into it.

523
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:28,620
Do you know the way you want to hang this?

524
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:30,680
You could have just knocked on my door.

525
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:32,680
I think he's only considered where he'd hang himself.

526
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:34,160
That corner seems fine.

527
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,080
Whoa, what the fuck?

528
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:37,700
for your housewarming party.

529
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:38,180
Oh.

530
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,120
I told people to bring a lamp or something.

531
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:40,560
Wait, wait.

532
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:42,960
More people are coming here.

533
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:44,340
This is going to be a party now?

534
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:45,900
Look, I'm not really...

535
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:46,420
My home's depressing.

536
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:49,660
Not what it looks like to me, but you're tidy whities.

537
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:50,560
Oh.

538
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:51,860
She just touched my...

539
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:53,160
This is your family photo area?

540
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:54,760
Kind of morbid.

541
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:57,000
Wish I'm kind of...

542
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,740
At least I had a family.

543
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:00,520
I'll go this too far.

544
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:01,100
Is that my work computer?

545
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:02,540
We figured it out, brother.

546
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:05,040
The man can be Mecca again.

547
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:05,640
Oh?

548
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:11,040
After your little premature Jack explosion, I had this feeling like I'd seen it before.

549
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:15,740
Then Vizzi asked me to get the energy reading we got this morning and cross-reference with recent calls.

550
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:16,560
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

551
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:18,180
It's not destroyed?

552
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:18,900
Wait, what?

553
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:25,040
And a bunch of B-grade villains have been trying to unlock its power only to end up blowing their asses off like you did.

554
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:28,160
Then they sell it on the next sucker and the same shit.

555
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:29,880
Oh, so there's a...

556
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:30,920
Four times that we've tracked.

557
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:32,540
How does Shroud not know this?

558
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:33,960
Yeah, probably think like us.

559
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:35,440
I think it was destroyed.

566
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:10,660
With his ex.

567
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:13,380
Oh, no.

568
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:15,840
He's hugging me.

569
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:18,440
That's like sex for him on his planet.

570
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:25,480
Oh, he saved it.

571
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,120
He shaved his depression.

572
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:29,260
Oh, he's not depressed anymore.

573
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:30,020
Oh, my God.

574
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:30,500
No.

575
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:32,740
Him!

576
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:35,500
God, Morsona has everything!

577
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:42,940
Rich, handsome, in the hunger gaze, and also hooking up with the devil lady?

578
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:44,160
God!

579
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:49,400
Thank you.

580
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:53,140
And he's a bad...

581
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:56,740
I'm so happy.

582
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:57,820
I'm so happy.

583
01:08:07,210 --> 01:08:09,190
That's why he's the goat.

584
01:08:15,410 --> 01:08:18,050
You do understand how projectors work, right?

585
01:08:18,190 --> 01:08:19,310
Not more dramatic.

586
01:08:20,910 --> 01:08:22,230
And bare walls are a sign of depression.

587
01:08:22,990 --> 01:08:24,770
Why isn't always a warehouse by the docks?

588
01:08:25,070 --> 01:08:26,990
It's where stuff comes in and stuff goes out.

589
01:08:27,210 --> 01:08:27,790
It's that easy.

590
01:08:27,910 --> 01:08:29,290
Not a rocket scientist, are you?

591
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:29,910
No.

592
01:08:29,910 --> 01:08:30,950
Oh yeah, where is Flambay?

593
01:08:31,390 --> 01:08:31,990
Yes, you're in.

594
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:33,910
He didn't come to my party!

595
01:08:34,350 --> 01:08:35,110
That work is tricky.

596
01:08:37,870 --> 01:08:38,670
my party.

597
01:08:40,150 --> 01:08:40,890
That's more than shit.

598
01:08:41,190 --> 01:08:42,070
You need a fucking army.

599
01:08:43,630 --> 01:08:44,430
I'll go.

600
01:08:45,510 --> 01:08:46,810
Can't shoot what you can't see.

601
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:50,730
Look, this is really great work, but doing this tonight is out of the question.

602
01:08:51,450 --> 01:08:54,510
Hitting a secure location like this is something they would handle downtown.

603
01:08:54,850 --> 01:08:55,330
Are you kidding?

604
01:08:55,770 --> 01:08:58,670
There's enough firepower in this room to take down a fucking Kaiju.

605
01:08:59,130 --> 01:09:00,990
Bunch of drunk ass Z-teamers, please.

606
01:09:01,090 --> 01:09:02,610
Y'all wouldn't make it past the front door.

607
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:04,490
No one's asking you to do a goddamn thing, okay?

608
01:09:04,550 --> 01:09:05,650
Hey, no need for that.

609
01:09:05,810 --> 01:10:04,930

610
01:10:05,930 --> 01:10:06,710
Wait, Robits?

611
01:10:07,610 --> 01:10:08,050
Macamann?

612
01:10:08,590 --> 01:10:08,750
What?

613
01:10:09,370 --> 01:10:10,270
You're playing them?

614
01:10:10,510 --> 01:10:11,290
You're playing yourself.

615
01:10:11,470 --> 01:10:12,070
Wait, no, I'm Robbit.

616
01:10:12,490 --> 01:10:14,030
I think you're invisible, but I fucking see you.

617
01:10:14,030 --> 01:10:14,590
I'm Robbit.

618
01:10:15,210 --> 01:10:15,570
Oh, no.

619
01:10:15,650 --> 01:10:17,270
You don't know anything about me.

620
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:18,630
I know you're a liar.

621
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:19,270
Criminal.

622
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:20,710
I know you're fucking dangerous.

623
01:10:20,870 --> 01:10:21,750
What else do I need to know?

624
01:10:22,850 --> 01:10:23,830
Wait, wait a minute.

625
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:24,610
He docks me.

626
01:10:24,930 --> 01:10:25,670
Wait, wait, chase.

627
01:10:26,870 --> 01:10:27,310
Wait.

628
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:29,710
Oh, my God.

629
01:10:31,590 --> 01:10:32,450
Oh, my God.

630
01:10:32,930 --> 01:10:35,330
Wait, but I, guys, I'm rapping.

631
01:10:35,930 --> 01:10:36,050
Guys!

632
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:38,990
That bitch sent his ass airborne.

633
01:10:39,510 --> 01:10:40,570
How are you not dead?

634
01:10:41,010 --> 01:10:41,590
You okay?

635
01:10:41,850 --> 01:10:43,310
Chase, are you all right?

636
01:10:44,230 --> 01:10:45,390
That's enough for tonight.

637
01:10:46,810 --> 01:10:47,550
So shots?

638
01:10:48,030 --> 01:10:49,930
I'm sorry, this turned into...

639
01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:51,810
I got dots!

640
01:10:54,070 --> 01:10:57,830
Anyone who utters one word about what happened tonight fucking answers to me.

641
01:10:58,590 --> 01:10:58,990
Got it?

642
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:06,060
Oh no, is this plan big?

643
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:07,700
Oh, shit.

644
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:08,820
Oh, that's awkward.

645
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:11,440
I'm guys, guys.

646
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:12,020
The frogs.

647
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:14,660
From that thing, you know?

648
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:15,940
Oh, that's, it's okay.

649
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:18,000
I think he wasn't here, right?

650
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:20,880
I think he wasn't here.

651
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:22,340
It's okay.

652
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:27,800
What's up?

653
01:11:36,190 --> 01:11:37,590
That's a red zone.

654
01:11:38,690 --> 01:11:40,230
Sir, you can't park there.

655
01:11:40,370 --> 01:11:41,050
That's a red zone.

656
01:11:41,970 --> 01:11:43,090
Is that funny?

657
01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:44,990
Did I make a funny joke?

658
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:46,450
Came back to apologize.

659
01:11:47,010 --> 01:11:49,410
All these goddamn apartments look the same.

660
01:11:49,710 --> 01:11:52,810
That guy watching us from the balcony walked into his house thinking it was yours.

661
01:11:53,370 --> 01:11:54,050
Sorry about that.

662
01:11:54,450 --> 01:11:55,050
Fuck you!

663
01:11:55,570 --> 01:11:57,190
He said he was sorry.

664
01:11:57,370 --> 01:11:58,410
Well, fuck you too!

665
01:11:58,970 --> 01:12:01,050
Okay, let's just...

666
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:03,190
Oh shit, that's a crystal.

667
01:12:03,810 --> 01:12:04,630
Is that Shugnight?

668
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,200
You sure this ain't vodka?

669
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:15,120
She told you.

670
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:16,940
Made quite a first impression.

671
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:19,960
Didn't know you would end up spitting in people's mouths.

672
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:20,840
Kinky shit.

673
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:22,500
It's that internet somehow made sense.

674
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:23,720
Isn't so bad for Doug?

675
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:24,980
You sound how you look.

676
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:27,200
Another thing I can't do anymore.

677
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:27,800
Fuck.

678
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:30,500
Maybe it's why I say the word so much.

679
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:32,800
Uh, sorry, Chase.

680
01:12:33,340 --> 01:12:34,540
I hadn't thought about that.

681
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:37,400
I had a pretty good run.

682
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:41,960
You ever think about why we do what we do?

683
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:45,040
Yeah, I don't think I'm stopping my dog in his time soon.

684
01:12:45,900 --> 01:13:15,540
put it all on the line for someone who won't ever know your name won't send you just how I'm wired bedside when you get hurt no no no it's how I'm wired I guess and here you are trying to rewire a bunch of criminals yeah what's wrong with that everyone deserves a second chance busy I was gonna walk off the team you know she's feeling low talking about how she was born with powers that always meant She'd end up as a villain.

685
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:19,440
Like he was fated.

686
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:21,600
I can see a picture.

687
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:23,900
So obviously I gave her the pep talk, you know.

688
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:26,040
Like, that's all bullshit.

689
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:28,200
You make up your own fate, yada, yada.

690
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,840
I don't even remember what I said, but I do remember thinking.

691
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:34,420
Oh, fuck.

692
01:13:35,860 --> 01:13:37,440
Yeah, that must have been hard.

693
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:42,780
Like, if I didn't have you, you know, my dad.

694
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:45,560
Where would I have ended up?

695
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:49,220
You were always good.

696
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:51,520
That was always in you.

697
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:54,160
That's what makes us different from a thief like her.

698
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:55,880
Oh, come on.

699
01:13:56,060 --> 01:13:57,220
You've stolen things too.

700
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:57,540
What?

701
01:13:57,960 --> 01:13:58,940
You racist motherfucker.

702
01:13:59,160 --> 01:13:59,560
I'm in the school.

703
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:07,120
Sorry, but you're- I need to blow my nose.

704
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:08,120
Give me a sec.

705
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:10,200
I should have laughed at that.

706
01:14:23,150 --> 01:14:30,970
I didn't mean that in a racist way, bro.

707
01:14:31,910 --> 01:14:37,010
I meant like, you know, you know, because you're young and you do reckless things.

708
01:14:38,570 --> 01:14:43,330
Bro, Mega Man situation is crazy, bro.

709
01:14:43,830 --> 01:14:46,270
Racial profiling from Mega Man?

710
01:14:52,580 --> 01:14:53,100
Wow!

711
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,200
Getting that Google Dockey ridden.

712
01:14:57,260 --> 01:14:58,180
Oh yeah, but that doesn't count.

713
01:14:58,340 --> 01:14:59,660
That was for somebody else.

714
01:15:03,450 --> 01:15:05,110
What, you quietly contemplating?

715
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:10,450
Yeah, I guess I hadn't considered some things.

716
01:15:12,050 --> 01:15:15,810
But I think the answers are out there if you just listen to the wind.

717
01:15:24,090 --> 01:15:35,430
i see why you and beat get along oh where's my guy oh i'm sorry my poor boy that's it there's my boy there's my good boy who's a good boy beef is

Is that not what she called herself?

721
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:07,260
What do you call her that?

722
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:08,760
You know who's not good, beefy boy?

723
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:10,080
You know who's a real pain?

724
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:10,460
Fizzy?

725
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:14,380
What the dead name?

726
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:16,320
Oh, dead.

727
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:17,800
Sorry, I'm busy gal.

728
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:20,720
I thought she hated the busy gal, the name.

729
01:16:22,180 --> 01:16:24,560
She was like, stupid and corny.

730
01:16:25,220 --> 01:16:26,260
Something would be great.

731
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:27,500
Yeah, let's start with something.

732
01:16:29,820 --> 01:16:31,360
Okay, it's okay, I'm not tired.

733
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:33,680
I could eat my steak a little bit.

734
01:16:36,220 --> 01:16:36,620
My...

735
01:16:36,620 --> 01:16:37,500
Or Vizzy.

736
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:40,640
I mean, she's doing something badass.

737
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:43,600
Bitch doesn't have to be derogatory.

738
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Be like, sup, bitch.

739
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:48,500
I remember this.

740
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:49,220
Up, upright.

741
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:50,320
Wait, is that?

742
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:51,720
Up, upright, guys.

743
01:16:51,860 --> 01:16:52,460
Remember that.

744
01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:53,680
Out of range.

745
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:54,500
What does that mean?

746
01:16:57,660 --> 01:16:58,060
Shit.

747
01:16:58,320 --> 01:16:58,840
Need a password.

748
01:16:58,940 --> 01:17:00,960
Up, up, up, up, right.

749
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:02,840
There you go.

750
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:05,000
Wait, there's nothing here.

751
01:17:10,150 --> 01:17:13,930
Hey, I'm getting a huge energy reading coming from the captain's quarters.

752
01:17:14,270 --> 01:17:14,270
Right.

753
01:17:14,750 --> 01:17:16,010
And I'm supposed to know where that is.

754
01:17:16,210 --> 01:17:16,770
See that tower?

755
01:17:17,230 --> 01:17:17,970
The biggest one.

756
01:17:18,190 --> 01:17:18,730
It's at the top.

757
01:17:18,830 --> 01:17:19,310
Oh, perfect.

758
01:17:19,490 --> 01:17:21,290
So you want me to cross this active battlefield?

759
01:17:21,910 --> 01:17:23,770
Look, I didn't want you to do any of this shit.

760
01:17:23,990 --> 01:17:24,730
I get it.

761
01:17:24,830 --> 01:17:25,010
Okay.

762
01:17:25,210 --> 01:17:25,450

Wait, don't.

820
01:21:14,140 --> 01:21:15,100
That was predictable.

821
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:18,400
What do we do when she's invisible?

822
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,800

823
01:21:21,380 --> 01:21:22,040
That is so overpowered.

824
01:21:23,540 --> 01:21:24,480
It's in the safe.

825
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:25,340
The safe?

826
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:27,240
I don't know how to open a fucking safe.

827
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:28,020
Wait, hard attack?

828
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:28,820

01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:31,160
Alright.

830
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:33,180
What do you mean hard attack?

831
01:21:33,580 --> 01:21:34,520
Successive, but...

832
01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:36,200
Okay, guys.

833
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:36,700

842
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:54,900

843
01:21:56,340 --> 01:21:58,680
It's just like, guys, come on, really?

844
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:08,220
There you go.

845
01:22:08,660 --> 01:22:09,080
All right, shit.

846
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:09,780
There's no more.

847
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:11,440
All right, that's fine.

848
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:15,800
I don't know what I did here.

849
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,440
Okay, encryption key collected.

850
01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:18,200
Okay.

851
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:22,500
Wait, did he respawn?

852
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:26,460
Okay, there you go.

853
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:26,840
It's fine.

854
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:29,260
We're fine.

855
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:30,320
Okay, now...

856
01:22:31,060 --> 01:22:31,960
Okay, is it in there?

857
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:35,040
Okay, it was...

858
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:36,300

Hey, Vizzy.

867
01:23:24,190 --> 01:23:24,730
Stay calm.

868
01:23:25,030 --> 01:23:26,050
Your inhaler is...

869
01:23:26,050 --> 01:23:27,710
A few feet in front of you, okay?

870
01:23:28,130 --> 01:23:29,410
You gotta get to it.

871
01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:29,870
Oh,

872
01:23:37,660 --> 01:23:39,220
that's why she always has trouble.

873
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:40,340
No!

874
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:46,380
Hey, Vizzy, he's just gonna keep fucking with you, but you don't give up, okay?

875
01:23:48,020 --> 01:23:50,740
Oh, she can't go invisible with the power.

876
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:53,660
Oh, the thing is still freezing.

877
01:23:54,420 --> 01:23:56,740
Bro, she can't freeze.

878
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:57,640
You get up.

879
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:58,600
Get up.

880
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:02,940
Oh, no, he has to go.

881
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:03,740
Keep up.

882
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:05,340
No!

883
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:07,520
He's gonna die!

884
01:24:11,430 --> 01:24:11,890
Chase!

885
01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:20,160
Okay, yeah, you're good.

886
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:24,380
He's gonna have a heart attack.

887
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,240
How much did he age?

888
01:24:36,310 --> 01:24:38,370
How much did he age?

889
01:24:39,970 --> 01:24:41,250
Oh, no.

890
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:57,400
Do you have a heart attack?

891
01:25:08,650 --> 01:25:10,270
Oh, why is anyone calling?

892
01:25:10,410 --> 01:25:14,230
Why did I run out of self-calling 911?

893
01:25:14,950 --> 01:25:16,830
What the fuck am I gonna do?

894
01:25:20,490 --> 01:25:21,750
Oh, my God.

895
01:25:27,780 --> 01:25:30,040
You only wanted to wait and make a plan.

896
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:31,660
Oh, yay, I'm the majority.

897
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:35,400
You helped him.

898
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:35,720
Yay!

899
01:25:36,380 --> 01:25:37,820
We did, we helped him.

900
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:43,140
Dan said, you and Forfeited posed in the Mechaman.

901
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:45,420
We didn't really have a lot of hard choices.

902
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:50,940
We failed to deal with the delivery parts.

903
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:51,500
Yeah.

904
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:55,400
Yay!

905
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:57,620
We became friends with a...

906
01:25:57,620 --> 01:25:59,260
Yeah, played as a bard.

907
01:25:59,640 --> 01:25:59,740
Yay.

908
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:02,440
Let's try with being a bard.

909
01:26:04,940 --> 01:26:05,220
Oh, wait.

910
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:06,420
I am 9-1-1.

911
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:07,280
Oh, you're right.

912
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:08,820
Yay, my most said hero.

913
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:11,140
For better than 60%.

914
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:14,240
I forgot.

915
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:15,340
I am 9-1-1.

916
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:15,580
How?

917
01:26:15,580 --> 01:26:17,760
What do I do when I'm 9-1-1?

918
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:23,300
The week after this episode felt so loud.

919
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:23,800
Oh, yeah.

920
01:26:23,860 --> 01:26:25,460
You guys have to wait a week after.

921
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:59,780
because they released episode 7 and 8 a week after that's why I waited you know all my friends they were like you gotta play dispatch I was like oh wait I hate this is why I hate episodic shit I fucking hate episodic like content because like there's like a cliffhanger and then you have to remember what happened like in the last episode and everything to like when you're especially if the episodes take very long to release because that was basically the walking dead The Walking Dead took so long to release in between episodes.

922
01:27:00,380 --> 01:27:03,560
So, it's like, so, like, people have, they always have to have a recap and everything.

923
01:27:04,220 --> 01:27:08,960
But, and then I was, like, telling my friends, I was like, I'm going to wait until everything is done.

924
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:10,500
So I can just play, play, play, play.

925
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:11,940
And I hate me.

926
01:27:26,980 --> 01:27:28,540
Collaboration with Critical Role.

927
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:31,280

01:29:21,820 --> 01:29:22,140
You know.

938
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:24,980
That was my grandpa, not my dad.

939
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:28,760
That was part of the superhero team.

940
01:29:36,130 --> 01:29:38,890
Yeah, teaching children how to smoke.

941
01:29:40,010 --> 01:29:40,490
Your favorite.

942
01:29:45,370 --> 01:29:47,210
I didn't realize you two are that close.

943
01:29:48,030 --> 01:29:48,550
I bet it.

944
01:29:48,890 --> 01:29:50,210
Teach him young.

945
01:29:53,410 --> 01:29:54,490
Oh, he's alive.

946
01:29:56,410 --> 01:29:57,490
He was like a brother.

947
01:29:59,770 --> 01:30:01,210
He was like a big brother to me.

948
01:30:02,510 --> 01:30:03,810
I didn't appreciate it enough.

949
01:30:05,230 --> 01:30:05,710
I'm sorry.

950
01:30:06,510 --> 01:30:09,930
Chase had only babysit nights when Dad had to deal with something big.

951
01:30:11,170 --> 01:30:13,310
Working late, he called him.

952
01:30:14,430 --> 01:30:43,030
I was fine being alone, but I had still asked to have and watched me because i could guilt trip him into buying me shit dude thank you for super chatting thank you and happy birthday we'll sing you a happy birthday soon dude after you know the guy after like the dying guy is gone so maybe one less door run for bitch ass robert and he wouldn't be stuck in here that's what you're saying right i mean it was but now that

953
01:30:48,030 --> 01:30:49,450
person that put Chase here.

954
01:30:50,710 --> 01:30:53,390
Pending the investigation, Invisigal suspended.

955
01:30:54,190 --> 01:30:58,390
Obviously, but I think you should consider cutting her from the team.

956
01:31:01,050 --> 01:31:01,310
No!

957
01:31:01,770 --> 01:31:02,470
I'm not saying you should.

958
01:31:03,550 --> 01:31:05,590
I'm just saying you should consider it.

959
01:31:05,630 --> 01:31:06,810
Might make things worse.

960
01:31:08,330 --> 01:31:09,050
I'm keeping her.

961
01:31:09,150 --> 01:31:10,930
I'm using all my power to keep her in.

962
01:31:11,210 --> 01:31:14,050
That might just make things worse.

963
01:31:14,310 --> 01:31:14,770
No!

964
01:31:15,150 --> 01:31:15,810
That's my girlfriend.

965
01:31:16,830 --> 01:31:17,830
It's just...

966
01:31:18,030 --> 01:31:22,230
I can't help but think that we've already cut a hero for far less.

967
01:31:22,450 --> 01:31:24,030
Yeah, but she didn't want to fuck me.

968
01:31:25,790 --> 01:31:26,850
That's different.

969
01:31:27,730 --> 01:31:28,850
Yeah, nepotism.

970
01:31:28,850 --> 01:31:30,750
Just gets better and better.

971
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:39,520
Vending machine.

972
01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:41,160
The true.

973
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:43,000
Whatever I want.

974
01:31:43,780 --> 01:31:44,060
Yeah.

975
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:50,400
See, if I hooked up with the boss, she would have given me a $100 allowance.

976
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:51,680
He told me that.

977
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:53,520
Oh, really?

978
01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:54,760
He's proud of me?

979
01:31:59,550 --> 01:32:01,750
Instead of just $5, I could have got $100.

980
01:32:06,130 --> 01:32:07,890
Oh, I'm sorry, Chase.

981
01:32:08,390 --> 01:32:09,030
Robert.

982
01:32:10,370 --> 01:32:11,290
Twinkie money.

983
01:32:14,170 --> 01:32:16,350
It's not about the money, Thurkey.

984
01:32:16,510 --> 01:32:18,390
It's about power and promotion.

985
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:26,780
Oh.

986
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:29,340
Got Twinkie, though.

987
01:32:32,970 --> 01:32:34,750
Oh, she gave me a shitty dollar.

988
01:32:37,290 --> 01:32:38,350
Not even flat.

989
01:32:38,830 --> 01:32:40,870
She made me crumpled up my $5.

990
01:32:42,270 --> 01:32:43,070
Water, boy.

991
01:32:45,710 --> 01:32:47,430
I just realized it's...

992
01:32:47,430 --> 01:32:48,050
What's his name?

993
01:32:48,250 --> 01:32:49,150
The YouTube...

994
01:32:49,150 --> 01:32:53,710
The guy who does, like, those types of animations.

995
01:32:54,810 --> 01:32:55,410
Where...

996
01:32:56,930 --> 01:32:59,150
Where you, like, trace over...

997
01:32:59,150 --> 01:32:59,390
Do we...

998
01:32:59,390 --> 01:32:59,430
Yeah.

999
01:32:59,450 --> 01:33:01,550
where you use like live action footage.

1000
01:33:01,630 --> 01:33:02,470
Yeah, Joel Haver.

1001
01:33:02,870 --> 01:33:03,390
I love that guy.

1002
01:33:03,390 --> 01:33:04,430
I love his animation.

1003
01:33:04,750 --> 01:33:08,350
He was also in Smiling Friends, but the fuck you save him.

1004
01:33:09,150 --> 01:33:13,290
But like he, his animations on YouTube is so good.

1005
01:33:13,390 --> 01:33:14,290
We have rotoscoping.

1006
01:33:14,770 --> 01:33:15,530
He used roto.

1007
01:33:15,530 --> 01:33:17,950
He used like not specific.

1008
01:33:18,110 --> 01:33:25,830
Yeah, so he used like rotoscoping animation mixed with like, what was it like the new AI feature in the Photoshop?

1009
01:33:26,390 --> 01:33:27,630
I'm a little mad too.

1010
01:33:31,130 --> 01:33:31,470
I can't.

1011
01:33:31,490 --> 01:33:40,070
can't it's not not fair in Visigal was the one who and then Chase shouldn't have

1012
01:33:44,390 --> 01:34:09,330
oh do you think he did the right thing I mean I don't it seems very not clear or unclear I think he did I think Chase knew he was the only one who could save her and he knew the risk so yeah i think it was ultimately the right thing he died for a villain so so that means she's redeemable

1013
01:34:12,370 --> 01:34:17,490
yeah twinkie oh case in point whoa

1014
01:34:22,350 --> 01:34:35,550
feel better kind of i'll clean it up what the fuck Like, did she have a crush on Chase or something?

1015
01:34:35,990 --> 01:34:38,910
Like, what kind of reaction was that?

1016
01:34:41,730 --> 01:34:42,050
Hey.

1017
01:34:43,590 --> 01:34:45,430
Waterboy is the Reaper build.

1018
01:34:45,690 --> 01:34:46,670
Some version of what happened.

1019
01:34:48,470 --> 01:34:49,350
Let's get to it.

1020
01:34:49,390 --> 01:34:52,770
Main takeaways are that Invisagal has been suspended.

1021
01:34:52,990 --> 01:34:54,410
So we're a person down the shift.

1022
01:34:54,930 --> 01:34:57,110
And that Chase is in the infirmary.

1023
01:34:58,610 --> 01:35:00,550
And he's in pretty rough shape.

1024
01:35:02,330 --> 01:35:05,030
despite his disposition.

1025
01:35:06,090 --> 01:35:07,650
No, he's depressed again.

1026
01:35:09,130 --> 01:35:10,770
Just don't tell him I told you that.

1027
01:35:11,750 --> 01:35:11,910
Oh.

1028
01:35:12,290 --> 01:35:16,730
I've found doing something good always helps when I'm feeling bad.

1029
01:35:17,930 --> 01:35:20,290
We're fortunate to have that opportunity.

1030
01:35:21,230 --> 01:35:23,530
Something Chase never took for granted.

1031
01:35:26,410 --> 01:35:28,090
So, let's get to work.

1032
01:35:28,570 --> 01:35:30,130
I guess there's like no off these years.

1033
01:35:30,130 --> 01:35:35,150
I guess you don't really have off day when you're, you, when everyone's always calling 9-1-1.

1034
01:35:35,830 --> 01:35:40,930
I mean, what do you do when like you're calling 9-1-1 and you're like, sorry, we're on a holiday?

1035
01:35:41,250 --> 01:35:42,870
Like, what the fuck do you do?

1036
01:35:44,690 --> 01:35:47,330
Also, Duke, happy birthday to you.

1037
01:35:47,690 --> 01:35:49,270
Happy birthday to you.

1038
01:35:49,590 --> 01:35:51,370
Happy birthday, dear Duke.

1039
01:35:51,650 --> 01:35:53,310
Happy birthday to you.

1040
01:35:53,370 --> 01:35:53,750
Yay.

1041
01:35:54,770 --> 01:35:55,610
Happy birthday.

1042
01:35:56,730 --> 01:35:59,150
Also, Cap and Romeo, the mistyper, thank you.

1043
01:35:59,170 --> 01:35:59,690

01:35:59,690 --> 01:36:30,950

Oh, Depression and Jack are best friends.

1049
01:36:40,590 --> 01:36:41,750
Oh my God, I could have sent them together.

1050
01:36:41,990 --> 01:36:42,490
I didn't realize.

1051
01:36:42,630 --> 01:36:44,230
Oh, Golem has no friends.

1052
01:36:45,250 --> 01:36:45,590

I mean, I could do this.

1121
01:41:41,880 --> 01:41:43,000
I cannot do that.

1122
01:41:45,480 --> 01:41:47,260
Um, we'll just wait a little bit.

1123
01:41:47,580 --> 01:41:48,420

I don't know.

1129
01:42:06,180 --> 01:42:08,480
Do we need combat for this or...

1130
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:10,440
No, Flambay.

1131
01:42:11,160 --> 01:42:12,700
No, Flambay is too strong.

1132
01:42:12,980 --> 01:42:13,940
Oh, wait, no, he's fine.

1133
01:42:14,120 --> 01:42:16,820
This has to be...

1134
01:42:20,780 --> 01:42:22,540
Do we need... It's speed?

1135
01:42:22,640 --> 01:42:23,560
Okay, we'll do this.

1136
01:42:24,820 --> 01:42:25,620
It's fine.

1137
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:25,960

1142
01:42:32,840 --> 01:42:33,880
Flambay, go in there.

01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:34,880
Flang's a bitch.

01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:35,640

Nice.

1148
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:12,360
We've arrested a bug lady.

1149
01:43:12,900 --> 01:43:14,540
Is she, like, hot, though?

1150
01:43:14,660 --> 01:43:16,300
Like, the one-punched man bug lady?

1151
01:43:16,980 --> 01:43:20,840
Bone Zone pissed off the wrong gang, and they're holding him hostage.

1152
01:43:21,060 --> 01:43:22,060
In the bone zone?

1153
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:24,960
Listen, I know he sucks, but he writes my checks.

1154
01:43:25,140 --> 01:43:26,660
Can you please just rescue him?

1155
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:27,300
There you go.

1156
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:29,200
We got you.

1157
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:33,120
Wait, are they all really...

1158
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:34,260
Are they... Okay, level two?

1159
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:44,300
And I'm going to try raising up Prism and Flambé and Depression Man and Jacksepticeye.

1160
01:43:45,820 --> 01:43:50,960
Hi, just calling to confirm one of your Z-Team heroes for our interview this afternoon to discuss the Phoenix program.

1161
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:51,780
Oh, okay.

1162
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:52,880
Will you sonar?

1163
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:54,580
He's going to have public speaking.

1164
01:43:55,560 --> 01:43:56,200
What's this?

1165
01:43:57,520 --> 01:43:58,360
I'll bet Golem in there.

1166
01:43:58,380 --> 01:43:59,700
I really think it can help the team too.

1167
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:01,560
Another one?

1168
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:02,880
Terrence?

1169
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:04,140
Let's learn.

1170
01:44:04,240 --> 01:44:05,020
Oh, shit.

1171
01:44:05,220 --> 01:44:05,760
Oh, shit.

1172
01:44:05,940 --> 01:44:06,280
We can't.

1173
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:09,680
Um, I gotta send sonar in here first.

1174
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:22,000
Um, yeah, I think, ah, I want to, I'll, I want to send him in, but the thing is, I need him to do this first.

1175
01:44:22,600 --> 01:44:22,800
Hello.

1176
01:44:23,320 --> 01:44:24,640
So, I'll do that later.

1177
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:28,020
I'm running late at the airport.

1178
01:44:28,280 --> 01:44:29,540
I zoned out there for a second.

1179
01:44:29,560 --> 01:44:31,480
Escort the mayor's assistant to look for the flight.

1180
01:44:31,580 --> 01:44:32,840
Okay, that has to be mobility.

1181
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:34,680
I have that in here.

1182
01:44:35,480 --> 01:44:36,140
That's fine.

1183
01:44:36,440 --> 01:44:36,920
Wait.

1184
01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:38,800
Let's do this first.

1185
01:44:39,500 --> 01:44:40,200
Alright, what did you get?

1186
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:44,560
Expands to fill each increasing stats by up to 200%.

1187
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:44,860
Oh!

1188
01:44:50,280 --> 01:44:51,540
Now we can do this.

1189
01:44:51,700 --> 01:44:52,380
We'll do this.

1190
01:44:52,860 --> 01:44:53,500
I like that.

1191
01:44:54,100 --> 01:44:58,520
We don't need to... Yeah, I think he can... Yeah, one seems really, really strong in general.

01:44:59,580 --> 01:45:00,500
Alright, what's this?

01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:05,100
Oh yeah, I would have no fucking ace that shit.

1194
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:07,600
Prism's power but it's so strong.

Okay, Flambay's solo.

1197
01:46:15,540 --> 01:46:16,080
We'll do that.

1198
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:16,560
All right.

1199
01:46:17,340 --> 01:46:19,260
And then flight license.

1200
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:20,280
Yeah, we don't have anybody.

1201
01:46:20,460 --> 01:46:22,620
Okay, we're going to have to play it safe.

1202
01:46:22,900 --> 01:46:23,860
Listen, we need to play it safe.

1203
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:24,820
No, we're going all in.

1204
01:46:25,240 --> 01:46:25,900

1205
01:46:25,900 --> 01:46:26,340

Get in!

1208
01:46:28,740 --> 01:46:29,240

01:46:30,120 --> 01:46:31,240
Okay, wait for her to return.

1212
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:33,820
And then I know what to do.

1213
01:46:34,580 --> 01:46:35,620
All right, coffee time.

1214
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:36,400
You coming back.

Both depression, man.

1217
01:46:39,440 --> 01:47:06,140
And then there's no way, I swear to God, if we fuck up with intellect, I swear to God, if it's intellect that we are missing, the one point of intelligence, I swear to God, I swear to God, there's no way I can fail this.

1218
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:08,920
Oh, nice.

1219
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:10,900

There we go.

1222
01:47:18,200 --> 01:47:20,460
If he dies, he'll be taken care of.

1223
01:47:20,860 --> 01:47:22,780
Yeah, that's nice to know.

1224
01:47:22,900 --> 01:47:23,840
More mobility.

Trust me.

1226
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:25,700

This fucking rain is flooding our neighborhood.

01:47:33,680 --> 01:47:34,820
We need this water gone.

1232
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:37,480
Move quickly before the flooding.

Okay, what do you mean, Waterboy?

1237
01:48:43,690 --> 01:48:45,350
He's just a janitor!

Okay, do we fetch...

1239
01:48:49,090 --> 01:48:53,790
What does fetch the bucket or examine the storm drain for clogs?

1240
01:48:54,150 --> 01:48:54,750
It's...

1241
01:48:56,370 --> 01:48:57,970
I mean, we're all around here.

1242
01:48:58,010 --> 01:48:59,950
I feel like it doesn't matter which one I do.

1243
01:49:02,370 --> 01:49:03,290
Bro, he's just...

1244

1249
01:49:13,030 --> 01:49:14,310
I guess some people died.

1250
01:49:14,530 --> 01:49:15,010
Fuck, man.

1251
01:49:15,510 --> 01:49:17,590
We said less water, not more.

1252
01:49:18,470 --> 01:49:20,350
Rescue civilians navigate.

1253
01:49:20,630 --> 01:49:21,530
Oh, sorry.

1254
01:49:22,030 --> 01:49:23,070
Sorry, man.

Yeah, thank God.

1258
01:49:29,370 --> 01:49:31,110
I was going to say I swear to God.

1259
01:49:31,390 --> 01:49:33,270
I'm in some of the 1% of the time.

1260
01:49:33,290 --> 01:49:33,910
intelligence.

1261
01:49:36,890 --> 01:49:38,050
Wait, you're depressed?

You're leveled up!

We need backup down here.

1269
01:49:53,210 --> 01:49:55,070
There's a mass pile up in the tanker caught fire.

1270

Okay.

1271
01:49:56,710 --> 01:49:57,850

01:49:57,930 --> 01:49:58,610
Okay, flambé.

1273
01:50:02,210 --> 01:50:03,250

1276
01:50:41,130 --> 01:50:42,790
What are you talking about?

1277
01:50:44,690 --> 01:50:46,570
I'm trying to think right now.

1278
01:50:47,570 --> 01:50:49,710
Okay, because I can only send one of them in.

1279
01:50:50,270 --> 01:50:55,110
I either send Flambe here or...

1280
01:50:55,110 --> 01:50:55,630
There's no...

1281
01:50:55,630 --> 01:50:57,710
Nobody's going to come back in time.

1282
01:50:57,850 --> 01:50:58,670
I think I have to send...

1283
01:50:58,670 --> 01:51:01,370
I'm sending Flambe to fight fire for fire.

1284
01:51:01,810 --> 01:51:03,050
Yeah, I'm sending him in.

1285
01:51:04,190 --> 01:51:05,370
He's going to...

1286
01:51:05,370 --> 01:51:07,610
We're going to fight fire with fire.

1287
01:51:07,630 --> 01:51:09,130
Let's go.

1288
01:51:12,190 --> 01:51:14,590
And then there's nothing else I could do.

1289
01:51:14,850 --> 01:51:16,710
She's the only one here.

1290
01:51:18,470 --> 01:51:19,870
Yeah, it's fine.

1291
01:51:20,170 --> 01:51:21,250
The room's booked, yeah?

1292
01:51:21,510 --> 01:51:22,630
Yeah, confirmed it this morning.

1293
01:51:22,930 --> 01:51:23,330
We're all good.

1294
01:51:24,330 --> 01:51:25,590
That's how it works.

1295
01:51:26,710 --> 01:51:28,250
I want to see you all there.

1296
01:51:29,470 --> 01:51:30,930
Someone's going to fuck up.

1297
01:51:35,030 --> 01:51:36,150
Oh, shit.

01:51:38,010 --> 01:52:17,030

01:52:51,600 --> 01:52:52,560
Wait, why are you guys fighting?

1302
01:52:55,600 --> 01:52:56,980
Your personal best.

1303
01:52:57,540 --> 01:52:57,800
Damn.

1304
01:52:58,420 --> 01:52:59,300
You want a part of that I thought?

1305
01:53:00,060 --> 01:53:00,720
What are y'all looking at?

1306
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:07,260
You've got a little...

1307
01:53:08,240 --> 01:53:08,460
Oh.

1308
01:53:09,480 --> 01:53:10,080
Cheers, lad.

1309
01:53:10,220 --> 01:53:10,800
Good looking out.

1310
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:12,180
Just paying for this.

1311
01:53:12,700 --> 01:53:14,120
Okay, who's gonna pay for this?

1312
01:53:15,060 --> 01:53:17,580
Hey, I'm the one that caused the damage.

1313
01:53:17,980 --> 01:53:18,380
With what?

1314
01:53:18,760 --> 01:53:19,180
With them.

1315
01:53:19,420 --> 01:53:19,740
Aw.

1316
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:21,320
Aw.

1317
01:53:22,300 --> 01:53:22,740
Okay.

1318
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:23,540
Cool.

1319
01:53:23,800 --> 01:53:26,080
Now that we got all of the details clear.

1320
01:53:26,780 --> 01:53:27,200
Why?

1321
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:29,160
That's just a difference of opinion.

1322
01:53:29,900 --> 01:53:30,640
I got heated.

1323
01:53:30,840 --> 01:53:32,160
Got in Golem's face.

1324
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:34,420
He had every right to punt me through the wall.

1325
01:53:34,860 --> 01:53:35,000
Right.

1326
01:53:35,260 --> 01:53:37,640
It's a door and I got you were actually in his face.

1327
01:53:37,860 --> 01:53:38,560
More like ankle.

1328
01:53:39,180 --> 01:53:40,140
Which made him easier to kick.

1329
01:53:40,340 --> 01:53:41,940
What the fuck is going on?

1330
01:53:42,540 --> 01:53:43,600
We want her out.

1331
01:53:44,280 --> 01:53:44,500
What?

1332
01:53:45,260 --> 01:53:46,420
Basically took a board vote.

1333
01:53:46,940 --> 01:53:48,260
That's why we're in the board room.

1334
01:53:48,260 --> 01:53:50,640
Why you're voting in these out?

1335
01:53:50,900 --> 01:53:52,880
I'm neither human nor reformed villain.

1336
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:55,920
Nor particularly interested in this conversation.

1337
01:53:57,260 --> 01:54:00,720
I only came in as I thought we were playing Magic the Gathering tonight.

1338
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:04,200
I am hoping we still may.

1339
01:54:06,420 --> 01:54:07,340
Who wants you to stay?

1340
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:09,500
Just me.

1341
01:54:10,340 --> 01:54:10,620
Oh.

1342
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:15,020
But the team is more important than any one of us so.

1343
01:54:16,240 --> 01:54:17,700
I won't stand him away.

1344
01:54:18,180 --> 01:54:19,160
You could have led with that.

1345
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:22,200
We heard about the suspension bullshit.

1346
01:54:23,220 --> 01:54:24,140
It ain't enough, Robert.

1347
01:54:24,580 --> 01:54:25,820
Not for what she did.

1348
01:54:26,900 --> 01:54:29,500
To put everything we've been building at risk, and for what?

1349
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:30,300
For me.

1350
01:54:30,500 --> 01:54:32,100
I like the bitch, but she gotta go.

1351
01:54:32,520 --> 01:54:33,720
And by go, we mean cut.

1352
01:54:34,440 --> 01:54:35,720
Just like you cut, Koop.

1353
01:54:38,180 --> 01:54:39,460
I'm gonna defend her!

1354
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,280
But that's what it is.

1355
01:54:41,860 --> 01:54:43,460
I'm defending her, I don't care.

1356
01:54:45,540 --> 01:54:48,320
Look, I probably don't say this.

1357
01:54:48,320 --> 01:54:49,580
She did it for me!

1358
01:54:50,140 --> 01:54:51,120
But I'm...

1359
01:54:51,120 --> 01:54:51,880
We're a family!

1360
01:54:52,280 --> 01:54:53,780
And I'm fucking here!

1361
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:54,500
Soon!

1362
01:54:55,860 --> 01:54:58,240
A few months ago, you wouldn't have been...

1363
01:54:58,240 --> 01:54:59,140
I'm already committed!

1364
01:54:59,580 --> 01:55:00,860
I'm discussing the needs of the Z team.

1365
01:55:01,140 --> 01:55:01,760
And if you did...

1366
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:04,340
If I can't have muscle mommy, I'll have her.

1367
01:55:09,110 --> 01:55:09,670
Soon.

1368
01:55:11,150 --> 01:55:13,430
But I'm not cutting this ago.

1369
01:55:14,450 --> 01:55:15,890
It was before bros.

1370
01:55:17,110 --> 01:55:24,510
We lift them up, and I believe of her, what I believe of all of you, that her heart is in the right place.

1371
01:55:26,250 --> 01:55:31,670
It's what took us from being a team to being this weird, fucked up family.

1372
01:55:34,450 --> 01:55:35,650
Look you're hurting.

1373
01:55:36,690 --> 01:55:37,470
Okay, I get it.

1374
01:55:37,790 --> 01:55:38,950
I'm hurting.

1375
01:55:39,190 --> 01:55:41,030
We are all hurting.

1376
01:55:41,210 --> 01:55:41,890
Good speech, Robert.

1377
01:55:42,370 --> 01:55:43,290
Now isn't the time.

1378
01:55:43,290 --> 01:55:45,090
Better speech than what the speech I was going to do.

1379
01:55:47,110 --> 01:55:50,350
It's the time to come together and heal.

1380
01:55:54,560 --> 01:55:54,840
Aww.

1381
01:55:58,980 --> 01:56:00,340
Moral has dropped?

1382
01:56:01,160 --> 01:56:02,000
What do you mean?

1383
01:56:02,040 --> 01:56:04,380
That was a good-ass speech!

1384
01:56:06,600 --> 01:56:10,500
What the fuck do you mean, Moral has dropped?

1385
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:14,920
Ohana means family!

1386
01:56:17,180 --> 01:56:17,900
Ohana.

1387
01:56:17,900 --> 01:56:17,980
Lizzie?

1388
01:56:21,170 --> 01:56:21,890
Sorry.

1389
01:56:22,270 --> 01:56:54,510
i can come back why first time we met you were in your underwear fitting right last time you see me that i'd be in mine oh yes i really do appreciate you defending me but you shouldn't i care about you they don't want me here i care about you courtney whoa no no in the risks what you were willing to put on the line i care about you girl yeah she went she did all that for me I'm willing to put myself out of that.

1390
01:56:54,510 --> 01:56:54,650
Because he cares about you.

1391
01:56:55,530 --> 01:57:00,410
And he's not the only one, so please don't throw all of that away by walking away from this.

1392
01:57:00,690 --> 01:57:01,630
First name, that's for you.

1393
01:57:01,650 --> 01:57:02,050
From us.

1394
01:57:03,470 --> 01:57:04,590
Fuck, from me.

1395
01:57:05,230 --> 01:57:05,710
Please.

1396
01:57:07,930 --> 01:57:08,670
They're right.

1397
01:57:09,430 --> 01:57:11,190
I don't deserve anyone's forgiveness.

1398
01:57:11,970 --> 01:57:12,630
Anyone's help.

1399
01:57:12,790 --> 01:57:13,670
Anyone's love.

1400
01:57:14,090 --> 01:57:15,070
I love you, though.

1401
01:57:15,550 --> 01:57:17,310
Because I can never repay it.

1402
01:57:17,810 --> 01:57:20,710
Nothing I do will ever make up for what I've already done to you.

1403
01:57:21,150 --> 01:57:22,250
I don't need you to repay.

1404
01:57:22,270 --> 01:57:26,370
Maybe the Astral Pulse back would help, but I couldn't even do that.

1405
01:57:27,010 --> 01:57:29,350
Vizzy, you don't owe anyone anything, okay?

1406
01:57:30,310 --> 01:57:31,510
Least of all me.

1407
01:57:34,630 --> 01:57:35,550
I was there that night.

1408
01:57:36,610 --> 01:57:37,270
What are you saying?

1409
01:57:38,190 --> 01:57:38,450
What?

1410
01:57:43,220 --> 01:57:43,700
Oh!

1411
01:57:44,220 --> 01:57:49,540
I said my own thing, but my asthma was getting worse, and they had an augment that could increase my life.

1412
01:57:49,540 --> 01:57:50,320
Bro, what?

1413
01:57:50,380 --> 01:57:51,740
You play Xbox Two?

1414
01:58:00,640 --> 01:58:07,180
YouTube please But she also plays Xbox

1415
01:58:17,070 --> 01:58:32,350
She was part of the game It is from this where she decided That being bad is bad She didn't do it a mecha man undetected

1416
01:58:44,900 --> 01:58:58,900
wait she's the one that put the bomb good news buddy trout says he just wants the astral pulse which we all know isn't really yours anymore yeah oh it was never about me

1417
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:12,780
so every all the red so they all knew about her oh and then she saw me and she's like wait he's cute I can't kill him I know.

1418
01:59:15,300 --> 01:59:17,020
She let her...

1419
01:59:17,020 --> 01:59:18,460
Okay guys, okay.

1420
01:59:19,020 --> 01:59:20,980
She let her pussy talk.

1421
01:59:25,820 --> 01:59:28,860
I quit the moment I placed it.

1422
01:59:29,760 --> 01:59:32,540
I walked out before it even blew.

1423
01:59:36,760 --> 01:59:39,260
My augments conveniently stopped working.

1424
01:59:39,660 --> 01:59:39,680
Oh.

1425
01:59:40,880 --> 01:59:44,100
So I signed up for the Phoenix program the next day.

1426
01:59:44,380 --> 01:59:45,480
We had...

1427
01:59:45,480 --> 01:59:46,660
Oh, because she didn't kill her.

1428
01:59:46,860 --> 01:59:48,520
You just gave me the chance to fuck your life up twice.

1429
01:59:51,080 --> 01:59:52,460
I forgive you.

1430
01:59:53,040 --> 01:59:54,460
Well, I forgive you.

1431
01:59:55,420 --> 01:59:57,740
So there, we fucking chill out now.

1432
01:59:57,760 --> 01:59:59,240
Tokyo is so degenerate.

1433
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:00,300
You fucking forgive me?

1434
02:00:00,680 --> 02:00:03,860
You haven't even, like, processed what's going on.

1435
02:00:04,420 --> 02:00:06,560
You did villain shit while you were a villain.

1436
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:08,580
Does it change things that you dropped without me?

1437
02:00:08,640 --> 02:00:10,160
I forgive you, though.

1438
02:00:10,260 --> 02:00:11,060
That's in the past.

1439
02:00:11,360 --> 02:00:13,460
You're not the same person that was there that night.

1440
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:14,100
Neither am I.

1441
02:00:16,400 --> 02:00:18,380
That's sweet, but...

1442
02:00:20,220 --> 02:00:21,140
I feel numb.

1443
02:00:22,280 --> 02:00:24,320
Hey, stop making this feel like a goodbye.

1444
02:00:25,200 --> 02:00:25,980
Okay, you're suspended.

1445
02:00:26,200 --> 02:00:26,840
It's temporary.

1446
02:00:27,080 --> 02:00:28,600
I'm not letting anyone cut you.

1447
02:00:29,940 --> 02:00:33,320
All I wanted from this was for you to look at me the same way you look at Blazer.

1448
02:00:34,420 --> 02:00:34,700
What?

1449
02:00:34,700 --> 02:00:36,500
What if it was just once, you know?

1450
02:00:37,480 --> 02:00:39,100
I don't look at Blazer.

1451
02:00:39,480 --> 02:00:40,740
I don't know what you mean by that.

1452
02:00:41,820 --> 02:00:42,060
What?

1453
02:00:42,060 --> 02:00:42,420
What?

1454
02:00:42,420 --> 02:00:42,760
What?

1455
02:00:45,200 --> 02:00:46,240
You do.

1456
02:00:49,210 --> 02:00:50,070
I chose...

1457
02:00:50,070 --> 02:00:53,950
Sorry, my chat chose you over Blazer.

1458
02:00:54,570 --> 02:00:55,970
So, come on, girl.

1459
02:00:56,190 --> 02:00:57,590
What the fuck do you mean?

1460
02:00:58,470 --> 02:00:59,350
Oh, like a hero.

1461
02:00:59,530 --> 02:01:00,070
Oh, sorry.

1462
02:01:00,290 --> 02:01:01,110
I thought you meant something.

1463
02:01:01,390 --> 02:01:01,550
Oh!

1464
02:01:01,910 --> 02:01:02,230
Whoa!

1465
02:01:02,750 --> 02:01:03,210
Oh!

1466
02:01:08,310 --> 02:01:09,570
Oh, like a hero.

1467
02:01:09,710 --> 02:01:10,730
Lean in.

1468
02:01:13,630 --> 02:01:16,070
Oh, shit.

1469
02:01:16,670 --> 02:01:18,590
Oh, my God.

1470
02:01:18,710 --> 02:01:19,130
Everywhere.

1471
02:01:19,410 --> 02:01:20,910
Why the fuck would I lean out?

1472
02:01:20,950 --> 02:01:35,050
This was all I fucking I put my career on the line I put my career on the line and keep her on the team I might as well lean in This was what I was building for

1473
02:01:42,950 --> 02:01:50,050

Thank you.

1477
02:02:07,620 --> 02:02:09,140
Press that story on SDN here.

1478
02:02:09,240 --> 02:02:10,240
I got hurt last night.

1479
02:02:10,660 --> 02:02:11,980
Can't tell them it was Trackstar.

1480
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:15,080
I want people to know what Chase did, but I don't know how he'd feel.

1481
02:02:16,700 --> 02:02:19,060
Or should I say it was Invisigal.

1482
02:02:19,640 --> 02:02:21,400
They messed up when we got to her.

1483
02:02:22,060 --> 02:02:23,840
So it wouldn't be a lie.

1484
02:02:26,140 --> 02:02:26,580
Invisigal.

1485
02:02:27,900 --> 02:02:29,620
I just feel like, oh my gosh, she types.

1486
02:02:30,380 --> 02:02:31,260
Like, in...

1487
02:02:31,260 --> 02:02:32,500
Wait, why Trackstar?

1488
02:02:33,460 --> 02:02:33,800
Okay.

1489
02:02:34,080 --> 02:02:34,980
Is it Trackstar?

1490
02:02:35,400 --> 02:02:54,400
it would be a better ending because my first thought was in visit yeah chase is the hero yeah but like but i feel like if we do it for busy then uh you dox you you dox

I know what's going on.

1502
02:04:32,100 --> 02:04:33,840
Kid probably lost someone there.

1503
02:04:34,360 --> 02:04:36,040
That's why he's been staring at that shit all night.

1504
02:04:37,680 --> 02:04:38,780
Get him a drink on me.

1505
02:04:40,980 --> 02:04:42,460
Wait, is that Shroud?

1506
02:04:43,040 --> 02:04:44,280
He looks too normal.

1507
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:45,860
Nah.

1508
02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:47,600
This one's on me.

1509
02:04:49,420 --> 02:04:50,400
Shroud, that's you?

1510
02:04:51,560 --> 02:04:53,060
Why are he at the villain bar?

1511
02:04:59,020 --> 02:05:00,580
It has to be Shroud.

1512
02:05:00,860 --> 02:05:03,560
Like, he looks way too normal to be in a villain bar.

1513
02:05:03,900 --> 02:05:05,760
And he looks like a goddamn nerd.

1514
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:10,800
Oh, oh my.

1515
02:05:12,220 --> 02:05:13,240
Yeah, he looks like a villain.

1516
02:05:14,460 --> 02:05:17,340
Yeah, I'm like, you have to be a villain to be at a villain bar.

1517
02:05:17,500 --> 02:05:19,060
And, like, he looks way too normal.

1518
02:05:19,640 --> 02:05:21,660
And he looks like a fucking nerd.

1519
02:05:21,880 --> 02:05:23,080
Only Shroud is a nerd.

1520
02:05:24,740 --> 02:05:25,620
Get fucked.

1521
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:27,120

1522
02:05:30,470 --> 02:05:31,330

1526
02:06:43,490 --> 02:06:45,550
Feel silly calling you to hideout.

1527
02:06:49,980 --> 02:06:51,540
Can you take care of him for me?

1528
02:06:52,580 --> 02:06:54,100
Obviously, you two don't need an introduction.

1529
02:06:55,840 --> 02:06:56,360
With pleasure.

1530
02:06:56,760 --> 02:06:58,240
Oh, shit he knows!

1531
02:06:59,360 --> 02:06:59,360
Oh!

1532
02:07:03,410 --> 02:07:04,010
You.

1533
02:07:04,930 --> 02:07:05,930
Your dad.

1534
02:07:06,170 --> 02:07:06,750
Troud?

1535
02:07:07,570 --> 02:07:09,070
I fucking knew, Allison!

1536
02:07:09,250 --> 02:07:11,410
Why is this nerd in the village bar?

1537
02:07:11,530 --> 02:07:12,870
It has to be shroud.

1538
02:07:13,310 --> 02:07:14,690
This old-ass nerd.

1539
02:07:15,610 --> 02:07:17,410
I fucking knew it!

1540
02:07:17,530 --> 02:07:19,230
There's no solving human nature.

1541
02:07:19,530 --> 02:07:20,830
I damn knew that was him.

1542
02:07:21,310 --> 02:07:21,910
Fucking nerdass.

1543
02:07:22,830 --> 02:07:29,190
All you can do is control it.

1544
02:07:33,270 --> 02:07:33,970
Oh, fuck.

1545
02:07:35,570 --> 02:07:36,470
I believe him, boss.

1546
02:07:36,890 --> 02:07:39,470
If he had something to say, he would have said it by now.

1547
02:07:40,350 --> 02:07:41,730
I thought you wanted revenge.

1548
02:07:45,410 --> 02:07:47,110
This was your father's gun.

1549
02:07:47,970 --> 02:07:49,090
Kept it in his locker.

1550
02:07:49,570 --> 02:07:50,130
Fully loaded.

1551
02:07:51,070 --> 02:07:51,710
Six shots.

1552
02:07:52,810 --> 02:07:55,090
He couldn't have predicted I'd use it to kill him.

1553
02:07:56,210 --> 02:07:57,750
The first bullet grazed his shoulder.

1554
02:07:58,570 --> 02:08:00,350
I hadn't had dusted to the adrenaline spike.

1555
02:08:01,030 --> 02:08:02,490
Wait, is that fired sooner?

1556
02:08:02,630 --> 02:08:04,190
Would he join the crowd?

1557
02:08:05,110 --> 02:08:05,690
Bro, what?

1558
02:08:05,710 --> 02:08:09,950
He's lying on the floor or I was full of fear when I put the floor through his face.

1559
02:08:10,870 --> 02:08:15,230
A bit of a waste to put the fifth through that idiot's skull, but I wanted to make sure it worked after all these years.

1560
02:08:15,930 --> 02:08:18,010
What the fuck is Sodenar gonna do?

1561
02:08:18,190 --> 02:08:19,090
Talk me to death?

1562
02:08:19,950 --> 02:08:23,210
Your father was the last person to touch this bullet.

1563
02:08:23,470 --> 02:08:28,050
And now, there's a 16 and a half percent chance it touches you next.

1564
02:08:28,810 --> 02:08:33,330
Your invisible girlfriend stole my astral pulse to give it to you.

1565
02:08:34,870 --> 02:08:36,770
Where the fuck is it?

1566
02:08:37,370 --> 02:08:39,610
I don't... She's still...

1567
02:08:40,770 --> 02:08:43,550
I'm gonna spit in his face.

1568
02:08:44,310 --> 02:08:45,150
I'll control this.

1569
02:08:45,250 --> 02:09:15,090
gonna kill you that's cute that's right do it this is why i hate luck if i had it wide i let you stream me about a fucking pinata she didn't get the pulse i won the gotcha yay i trusted my gotcha odds you actually believe that

1570
02:09:21,280 --> 02:09:21,840
What?

1571
02:09:22,500 --> 02:09:25,700
Invisibitch has the pulse that I know.

1572
02:09:27,520 --> 02:09:31,140
What I don't know is why she didn't give it to you.

1573
02:09:33,600 --> 02:09:34,760
She played you too.

1574
02:09:36,300 --> 02:09:39,880
Here I am thinking she's working with you, but she's fucking with you both.

1575
02:09:41,520 --> 02:09:43,600
She didn't take it for you.

1576
02:09:45,580 --> 02:09:47,000
She took it for herself.

1577
02:09:48,760 --> 02:09:51,000
No, she did it to protect me.

1578
02:09:51,420 --> 02:09:53,600
No, I don't trust you.

1579
02:09:54,980 --> 02:09:56,500
She fooled me too.

1580
02:09:57,980 --> 02:10:00,060
No, she did it to protect me.

1581
02:10:00,140 --> 02:10:01,520
I love this strike.

1582
02:10:02,940 --> 02:10:03,740
Oh, shit.

1583
02:10:05,620 --> 02:10:07,040
That's my girl.

1584
02:10:08,120 --> 02:10:08,780
What's this?

1585
02:10:09,760 --> 02:10:10,600
Oh, Blazer.

1586
02:10:11,820 --> 02:10:12,220
Dad.

1587
02:10:12,960 --> 02:10:13,500
See that?

1588
02:10:13,700 --> 02:10:14,900
It says dad on the top.

1589
02:10:19,540 --> 02:10:20,460
The blonde Blazer.

1590
02:10:20,480 --> 02:10:24,320
I fired the bartender, but I can still get you something to drink.

1591
02:10:25,260 --> 02:10:25,840
No, thank you.

1592
02:10:29,120 --> 02:10:30,340
Into what do I owe the pleasure?

1593
02:10:32,440 --> 02:10:33,540
I'm here for him.

1594
02:10:36,800 --> 02:10:45,700
In five minutes, this bar will be surrounded by SDN agents, heroes, and whoever else you in your ring have pissed off recently, which happens to be every gang in Los Angeles.

1595
02:10:48,060 --> 02:10:48,620
Now, if...

1596
02:10:52,000 --> 02:11:28,760
bluffing what sorry about that if they weren't you wouldn't have cut them oh you were saying but why is he giving her a tip off why is she giving her tip that eventually I would fall but by my read I'm taking a lot of you with me oh so all of you can leave now or half of you can die here

1597
02:11:33,200 --> 02:11:52,580
horrifying that's a fucking superhero chills top-notch you made them nervous okay we're out of here take your piss-soaked pants out the back please don't want to tempt this tiger

1598
02:11:56,640 --> 02:12:16,200
now's not our time blazer but it's coming sooner than you think oh and by my calculations it was closer to 32 percent but half sounds better yeah she rounded up guys

1599
02:12:20,570 --> 02:12:27,870
guys look there's no there's wait canva's Well, I wouldn't know how she found me first.

1600
02:12:28,130 --> 02:12:28,150
How'd you know?

1601
02:12:28,170 --> 02:12:28,590
Find me.

1602
02:12:29,610 --> 02:12:29,910
Yeah.

1603
02:12:30,310 --> 02:12:31,010
I tracked your phone.

1604
02:12:31,890 --> 02:12:32,130
Sorry.

1605
02:12:33,310 --> 02:12:35,090
I'll never forgive you.

1606
02:12:37,350 --> 02:12:37,870
Oh.

1607
02:12:37,870 --> 02:12:39,150
She's a stocky.

1608
02:12:41,330 --> 02:12:41,850
Oh.

1609
02:12:44,110 --> 02:12:44,630
Okay.

1610
02:12:45,430 --> 02:12:45,810
Okay.

1611
02:12:47,790 --> 02:12:48,310
Okay.

1612
02:12:48,570 --> 02:12:48,850
I know.

1613
02:12:48,950 --> 02:12:49,370
Ring, ring, ring.

1614
02:12:49,510 --> 02:12:51,110
I got another write-up for you.

1615
02:12:51,210 --> 02:12:52,270
Another citation.

1616
02:12:53,550 --> 02:12:55,050
She got you pretty bad.

1617
02:12:55,110 --> 02:12:55,350
Okay.

1618
02:12:56,010 --> 02:12:56,470
Hmm.

1619
02:12:57,470 --> 02:12:58,710
Are you sure he's right about him?

1620
02:12:59,230 --> 02:12:59,530
Phenomenal.

1621
02:13:01,810 --> 02:13:03,370
I saw the footage.

1622
02:13:04,130 --> 02:13:05,090
What is her play?

1623
02:13:05,990 --> 02:13:07,410
Why wouldn't she tell you if she has it?

1624
02:13:08,030 --> 02:13:09,890
Okay, first of all, why are you tracking me?

1625
02:13:10,110 --> 02:13:12,070
I don't understand what she would want it for unless...

1626
02:13:12,070 --> 02:13:13,010
I trust her.

1627
02:13:13,470 --> 02:13:14,330
I trust her!

1628
02:13:14,470 --> 02:13:15,650
She's protecting me!

1629
02:13:18,770 --> 02:13:20,970
What matters is...

1630
02:13:20,970 --> 02:13:21,710
I trust her.

1631
02:13:22,370 --> 02:13:23,650
I think you're more optimistic.

1632
02:13:23,650 --> 02:13:25,110
I think they fired HR.

1633
02:13:30,320 --> 02:13:31,840

Wait, what?

1638
02:14:44,610 --> 02:14:45,510
Oh shit!

Why the helicopter?

1640
02:14:51,410 --> 02:14:52,790
What the fuck?

1641
02:14:59,180 --> 02:15:05,100
Okay, to be fair, 50% of them are SDN subscribers, so we only have to stay 50% of the town.

1642
02:15:08,960 --> 02:15:10,540
Bro, that guy's a flasher.

1643
02:15:10,980 --> 02:15:12,640
You're not leaving me here again.

1644
02:15:14,220 --> 02:15:16,620
Can we not have a superhero that can, like, heal?

1645
02:15:17,480 --> 02:15:18,920
Like, is that not...

1646
02:15:18,920 --> 02:15:21,460
That power not exist in this fucking world?

1647
02:15:29,790 --> 02:15:30,870
GG's no support.

1648
02:15:31,110 --> 02:15:33,610
Honestly, yeah, I'm like, GG's no support.

1649
02:15:41,470 --> 02:15:41,950
Yeah.

1650
02:15:44,590 --> 02:15:44,990
Yeah.

1651
02:15:45,610 --> 02:15:46,010
Nice.

1652
02:15:47,370 --> 02:15:48,070
Yay!

1653
02:15:48,310 --> 02:15:49,490
We're all simps.

1654
02:15:53,140 --> 02:15:54,060
Forgive her.

1655
02:15:54,260 --> 02:15:54,600
Yay!

1656
02:15:54,840 --> 02:15:56,740
We're all thinking of our peepies.

1657
02:15:59,300 --> 02:16:00,120
Yippee!

1658
02:16:03,600 --> 02:16:04,160
Yay!

1659
02:16:05,200 --> 02:16:07,220
40 thoughts win again!

1660
02:16:07,820 --> 02:16:12,580
Yeah, you at 10% chose a cigar.

1661
02:16:14,560 --> 02:16:15,880
Damn, right.

1662
02:16:16,200 --> 02:16:17,920
The real majority.

1663
02:16:18,420 --> 02:16:20,940
Okay, 46% did it as salt the barn.

1664
02:16:21,280 --> 02:16:21,660
Yippee!

1665
02:16:22,660 --> 02:16:25,140

1666
02:16:30,140 --> 02:16:31,700
Okay, rescue golem.

02:16:31,920 --> 02:16:32,640
Chose to go out.

1668
02:16:32,700 --> 02:16:34,640
Yeah, we all chose to beat up the red ring.

1669
02:16:36,120 --> 02:16:38,740
Now, man, you perform better than 20%.

1670
02:16:41,900 --> 02:16:43,480
Because he's phenomenal.

1671
02:16:46,700 --> 02:16:48,480
No, I've never smoked in my life.

1672
02:16:48,780 --> 02:16:49,700
My dad smoked.

1673
02:16:49,800 --> 02:17:09,780
In Asia pot smoking is like uh of norm like you could in back then you can i i think i don't know you can still can but like you could smoke in restaurants like they have like each table will have a smoking tray thank you depressed man but

1674
02:17:19,690 --> 02:17:27,990

1675
02:17:34,150 --> 02:17:34,890
Oh, nice.

1676
02:17:35,030 --> 02:17:36,150
He's making him bellies.

1677
02:17:38,470 --> 02:17:39,910
His name's Mr. Whiskey.

1678
02:17:53,450 --> 02:17:55,910
Yeah, I'm very sure, like, vaping is a lot worse.

1679
02:18:09,020 --> 02:18:09,620
Oh, hello.

1680
02:18:10,660 --> 02:18:11,800

1681
02:18:12,320 --> 02:18:13,760
He saved it.

1682
02:18:14,020 --> 02:18:14,520
Thank you.

1683
02:18:14,560 --> 02:18:16,440
That's, uh, your lifesaver.

1684
02:18:17,580 --> 02:18:19,500
Did he not go home?

1685
02:18:22,820 --> 02:18:24,260
I don't think he went home.

1686
02:18:24,360 --> 02:18:25,700
I think he went straight to work.

1687
02:18:26,040 --> 02:18:26,260
Bro, what?

1688
02:18:27,260 --> 02:18:34,880
The report coming in from the refinery multiple augmented villains breaking containment Dispatch all available heroes in the area boss.

1689
02:18:35,280 --> 02:18:36,820
We don't have any heroes in the area.

1690
02:18:37,020 --> 02:18:38,260
What can you handle things here?

1691
02:18:39,020 --> 02:18:39,760
Where are our heroes?

1692
02:18:40,240 --> 02:18:44,200
I Just think I need to get out into the field for us to have a shot.

1693
02:18:44,360 --> 02:18:44,540
Wait.

1694
02:18:44,840 --> 02:18:45,280
Oh my god.

1695
02:18:45,320 --> 02:18:45,440
Go.

1696
02:18:45,840 --> 02:18:46,380
We got you covered.

1697
02:18:46,580 --> 02:19:17,660

02:19:28,370 --> 02:19:32,950
Yeah what there's only three What happened What you mean is this it?

1699
02:19:33,090 --> 02:19:36,170
Bitch you know what time it is I didn't mean it like that.

1700
02:19:36,470 --> 02:19:39,350
Thanks for getting out of bed or whatever you were up to.

1701
02:19:39,350 --> 02:19:42,890
Yeah, I'd say come here to fall asleep, so I might be just a little.

1702
02:19:44,710 --> 02:19:46,390
Are you gonna finish your sentence, big man?

1703
02:19:46,710 --> 02:19:46,950
Hmm?

1704
02:19:47,630 --> 02:19:48,030
Yeah.

1705
02:19:48,630 --> 02:19:50,670
Oh no, he's fucking out of it.

1706
02:19:50,810 --> 02:19:51,750
Look, we're shorthanded.

1707
02:19:51,830 --> 02:19:53,270
Technically for it with Prism.

1708
02:19:53,630 --> 02:19:56,150
We should have the rest of the team trickling in, so we'll have to make do for now.

1709
02:19:56,430 --> 02:19:59,130
Lucky for us, we got the best three heroes on the roster.

1710
02:19:59,350 --> 02:20:01,750
We all know you'd say the same shit about whoever was weird.

1711
02:20:01,790 --> 02:20:03,930
Like if we all know, then there's no reason to point it out.

1712
02:20:05,310 --> 02:20:07,710
Also, like, doesn't prison have concerts to do?

1713
02:20:08,690 --> 02:20:11,730
Like, I thought being a pop star makes you, like, extra busy.

1714
02:20:16,290 --> 02:20:17,030
Like, I feel...

1715
02:20:17,030 --> 02:20:17,770
Oh, wait, what happens?

1716
02:20:17,930 --> 02:20:18,850
Oh, I guess there's...

1717
02:20:18,850 --> 02:20:19,730
Oh, whoa, oh!

1718
02:20:20,070 --> 02:20:20,510
Jesus!

1719
02:20:21,190 --> 02:20:23,090
Red Ring swarming all over the fucking city!

1720
02:20:23,630 --> 02:20:25,730
First things first, yes, half the team is missing.

1721
02:20:25,810 --> 02:20:27,150
Let's fix that immediately.

1722
02:20:27,410 --> 02:20:28,930
Next, LA is on fire.

1723
02:20:29,410 --> 02:20:31,150
Okay, we'll work on that third thing.

1724
02:20:31,270 --> 02:20:33,050
Okay, but when is LA not on fire?

1725
02:20:33,110 --> 02:20:34,970
It's losing out of every crack in the city.

1726
02:20:35,250 --> 02:20:35,950
Damn, dog.

1727
02:20:35,950 --> 02:20:36,970
That's a lot of things.

1728
02:20:37,250 --> 02:20:40,770
It is a lot of things, but nothing we can't handle.

1729
02:20:41,470 --> 02:20:43,230
So, I need you guys to focus.

1730
02:20:43,650 --> 02:20:45,390
Shit's only going to get worse if you don't.

1731
02:20:46,010 --> 02:20:46,570
You with me?

1732
02:20:46,990 --> 02:20:48,580
I mean, true, but...

1733
02:20:49,790 --> 02:20:52,430
Was there a forest fire like last year?

1734
02:20:55,410 --> 02:20:58,850
Clear Red Ring Grooves Protected Defenseless Employees.

1735
02:20:59,830 --> 02:21:00,510
Okay, oh.

1736
02:21:00,510 --> 02:21:03,090
Red Ring just released an experiment from containment.

1737
02:21:03,410 --> 02:21:06,110
It's a big thing.

1738
02:21:07,250 --> 02:21:42,410

1740
02:21:52,590 --> 02:22:07,230
So I don't know I'm gonna put you on this suspicious package outside of City Hall Please send someone to investigate bomb squad is tied up Yeah, this is intelligence, but she's not that smart

1741
02:22:11,030 --> 02:22:12,430
She's not that smart.

1742
02:22:12,750 --> 02:22:15,810
She's my second smartest, which isn't saying much, guys.

1743
02:22:18,690 --> 02:22:19,290
It's...

1744
02:22:19,290 --> 02:22:22,450
Oh yeah, her morale is down because I was like, no.

1745
02:22:23,850 --> 02:22:24,730
Oh, shit.

1746
02:22:25,030 --> 02:22:26,170
Oh, shit.

1747
02:22:26,990 --> 02:22:28,130
Oh, no!

1748
02:22:29,350 --> 02:22:31,070
We're not gonna evacuate!

1749
02:22:31,790 --> 02:22:33,050
See that bar on the top left?

1750
02:22:33,790 --> 02:22:34,710
That's Torrance.

1751
02:22:35,210 --> 02:22:36,270
Or what's left of it?

1752
02:22:36,310 --> 02:22:36,970
Oh, shit.

1753
02:22:37,250 --> 02:22:37,870
It's okay.

1754
02:22:38,130 --> 02:22:40,850
That mayor, Mr. Yao, he's not getting re-elected.

1755
02:22:41,810 --> 02:22:42,290
All right, everyone.

1756
02:22:42,610 --> 02:22:44,370
You should get live updates on the state of the city.

1757
02:22:44,990 --> 02:22:46,110
Let's kick some red ring.

1758
02:22:46,150 --> 02:22:46,750
It's fine.

1759
02:22:46,930 --> 02:22:50,130
That means that mayor is going to get impeached, guys.

1760
02:22:50,310 --> 02:22:51,070
That's okay.

1761
02:22:54,190 --> 02:22:55,210
Oh, my God.

1762
02:22:56,070 --> 02:22:56,610
Oh, home.

1763
02:22:57,170 --> 02:22:59,370
Are you fucking getting me?

1764
02:22:59,630 --> 02:23:00,750
There's no time for this.

1765
02:23:02,370 --> 02:23:02,750
Okay.

1766
02:23:03,010 --> 02:23:03,450
Don't worry.

1767
02:23:03,570 --> 02:23:04,570
You're better now.

1768
02:23:08,620 --> 02:23:40,040

Alright, we gotta be successful.

1770
02:23:44,520 --> 02:23:45,620
You're trying to step to me.

1771
02:23:47,880 --> 02:23:49,920
Wait, someone's tracker is freaking out.

1772
02:23:50,720 --> 02:23:52,800
We'll do that hacking thing that you do.

1773
02:23:53,660 --> 02:23:55,060
Alright, it's hacking time.

1774
02:23:56,280 --> 02:23:56,780
Uh, react.

1775
02:23:57,060 --> 02:23:57,540
Hi!

Okay.

1778
02:24:03,270 --> 02:24:05,310
Alright, this is gonna be scary.

1779
02:24:05,430 --> 02:24:06,590
Because it's a high hack.

1780
02:24:08,390 --> 02:24:10,330
I've never done a high one before.

1781
02:24:11,210 --> 02:24:12,530
Oh, fuck off.

1782
02:24:12,810 --> 02:24:13,990
Ah, you kidding me?

02:24:17,630 --> 02:24:18,470
Oh, my God.

1784
02:24:28,800 --> 02:24:29,520
Yeah, I need him to be here.

1785
02:24:39,240 --> 02:24:40,020
That's right.

1786
02:24:40,580 --> 02:24:41,700
I got you now.

1787

I will rescue the students.

2006
02:41:37,180 --> 02:41:37,980
They didn't have to die.

2007
02:41:40,460 --> 02:41:40,900
Phenomenon!

2008
02:41:43,760 --> 02:41:45,540
Okay, I have charisma.

2009
02:41:45,980 --> 02:41:48,020
Is that rally them against the real enemy?

2010
02:41:48,980 --> 02:41:51,440
Because I assume reason with them is, like, thinking.

2011
02:41:53,260 --> 02:41:54,020
Does it rally?

2012
02:41:54,280 --> 02:41:55,780
Yeah, that was a little bit too close.

2013
02:41:57,840 --> 02:41:59,460
Is rally charisma?

2014
02:42:01,440 --> 02:42:01,880
Yeah?

2015
02:42:02,120 --> 02:42:03,820
Okay, yeah, we have 10 charisma.

2016
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:05,420
There's no way we can fuck this up.

2017
02:42:09,520 --> 02:42:10,740
Oh, thank God.

2018
02:42:10,940 --> 02:42:11,400
Thank God.

2019
02:42:11,520 --> 02:42:13,240
Okay, we were very much qualified.

2020
02:42:13,320 --> 02:42:14,100
I'll say it.

2021
02:42:14,360 --> 02:42:16,880
I really feel like I don't get enough credit around here.

2022
02:42:17,040 --> 02:42:18,080
Oh, my God.

2023
02:42:18,580 --> 02:42:19,700

Okay, we just made it.

2027
02:42:23,360 --> 02:42:24,300
We just made it.

2028
02:42:24,380 --> 02:42:25,680
We were missing these two.

2029
02:42:30,020 --> 02:42:31,320
Okay, that's just tiny.

2030
02:42:32,940 --> 02:42:33,980
Alright, nice.

2031
02:42:35,660 --> 02:42:37,520
My might is unmatched.

2032
02:42:37,940 --> 02:42:39,000
Okay, everything's fine.

2033
02:42:39,960 --> 02:42:41,000
LA Country.

2034
02:42:41,500 --> 02:42:42,780

2035
02:42:43,480 --> 02:42:43,480

2038
02:42:50,160 --> 02:42:51,780
Wait, all my other villains!

2039
02:42:52,860 --> 02:42:55,300
When to- When- when to work?

2040
02:42:55,320 --> 02:42:56,580
Whatever it is, it sounds like more shit.

2041
02:42:57,580 --> 02:42:58,420
Oh, shit.

2042
02:42:59,780 --> 02:43:00,220
What?

2043
02:43:00,800 --> 02:43:01,980
Did everyone die there?

2044
02:43:01,980 --> 02:43:02,540
The Z-Team!

2045
02:43:03,120 --> 02:43:04,420
Get a load of my new friends.

2046
02:43:04,760 --> 02:43:06,180
Oh, no way.

2047
02:43:06,780 --> 02:43:07,620
That can't be.

2048
02:43:08,460 --> 02:43:08,940
Coup?

2049
02:43:09,520 --> 02:43:11,260
Yep, with more Red Ring backup.

2050
02:43:11,500 --> 02:43:12,600
Wait, who's injured?

2051
02:43:13,040 --> 02:43:13,900
I can't tell.

2052
02:43:14,340 --> 02:43:14,980
I'm not mad.

2053
02:43:15,380 --> 02:43:16,560
I'm just disappointed.

2054
02:43:16,960 --> 02:43:17,660
Oh, these two.

2055
02:43:18,180 --> 02:43:18,800
I don't care.

2056
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:19,380
Golem.

2057
02:43:19,660 --> 02:43:20,740
Fuck, say, Koop.

2058
02:43:21,400 --> 02:43:23,640
Why did you have to go and spread those wings of yours?

2059
02:43:24,300 --> 02:43:25,940
We want to save this city.

2060
02:43:26,040 --> 02:43:27,380
We need to take Koop down.

2061
02:43:28,180 --> 02:43:30,120
Without her, the red ring will scramble.

2062
02:43:31,760 --> 02:43:32,220
Alright.

2063
02:43:35,020 --> 02:43:35,800

Cope's crew.

2066
02:43:42,660 --> 02:43:43,700
Why do I do that?

2067
02:43:43,760 --> 02:43:47,340
I wish to speak with Blonde Blazer about the terms of my employment.

2068
02:43:53,510 --> 02:43:54,110

02:43:54,330 --> 02:43:56,410

Okay.

2324
03:01:53,290 --> 03:01:57,410
Red Ring has attacked the Vincent Thomas Bridge and is now escaping on the USS Iowa.

2325
03:01:57,610 --> 03:01:58,750
Need assistance in the pursuit.

2326
03:02:02,630 --> 03:02:03,290
Who's fast?

03:02:10,950 --> 03:02:11,590
Don't be depressed.

2331
03:02:11,870 --> 03:02:12,470
Don't be depressed.

2332
03:02:12,770 --> 03:02:13,370
Don't be depressed.

2333
03:02:13,630 --> 03:02:13,670
Don't be depressed.

2334
03:02:13,670 --> 03:02:14,530
Don't be depressed.

2335
03:02:15,270 --> 03:02:16,370
It becomes larger.

2336
03:02:18,890 --> 03:02:19,170
Yeah.

2337
03:02:24,440 --> 03:02:25,340

2340
03:02:31,400 --> 03:02:32,260
Oh, thank God.

2341
03:02:34,500 --> 03:02:36,400

Oh, thank God.

2345
03:02:39,500 --> 03:02:42,880
Oh, thank God.

2346
03:02:43,040 --> 03:02:44,380
Oh, thank God.

03:02:44,780 --> 03:02:44,780
Okay.

2348
03:02:49,040 --> 03:02:50,660
Oh my God, everyone's injured.

2349
03:02:52,560 --> 03:02:53,100
How can I help?

2350
03:02:54,440 --> 03:02:55,260
I'm on standby.

2351
03:02:58,880 --> 03:02:59,620
Everyone's hurt.

2352
03:03:00,860 --> 03:03:01,740
Everyone's hurt.

2353
03:03:05,180 --> 03:03:06,580
You do this.

2354
03:03:07,300 --> 03:03:08,540
I like being so hands-on again.

2355
03:03:09,420 --> 03:03:12,860
I mean, the citywide chaos isn't great, but, you know.

2356
03:03:13,740 --> 03:03:15,460
I forgot about- okay, okay.

2357
03:03:17,700 --> 03:03:19,040
I forgot about bla- I have blazer.

2358
03:03:25,010 --> 03:03:26,570
Are you fucking kidding me?

2359
03:03:27,690 --> 03:03:27,970
Oh.

2360
03:03:28,610 --> 03:03:28,930
Okay.

2361
03:03:30,490 --> 03:03:32,190
Okay, we send blazer into this.

2362
03:03:32,330 --> 03:03:34,670
We have to send- Wait, can I even send blazer?

2363
03:03:34,770 --> 03:03:38,530
Oh, I can't send blazer into this, because she only wants to see blazer.

2364
03:03:39,830 --> 03:03:42,570
Okay, she actually has to heal someone.

2365
03:03:53,550 --> 03:03:54,570
Still on my feet.

2366
03:03:56,430 --> 03:03:56,710
Okay.

2367
03:04:00,660 --> 03:04:01,720
Let them in again.

2368
03:04:04,600 --> 03:04:06,180
Okay, I swear to God.

2369
03:04:06,460 --> 03:04:10,080
I swear to God, guys, if they fuck it up, I swear to God.

2370
03:04:14,100 --> 03:04:15,740
Oh my God.

2371
03:04:16,000 --> 03:04:18,460
Bro, her stats are fucking crazy.

2372
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:23,920
Red ring stole one of our news copters.

2373
03:04:24,280 --> 03:04:25,580
They're firing out of civilians.

2374
03:04:26,100 --> 03:04:30,660
You know what you can go in the copter out now Helicopters are annoying on the best of days.

2375
03:04:30,860 --> 03:04:34,140
I'll just send blonde blazer everywhere All right.

2376
03:04:34,760 --> 03:04:35,520
Oh, come on

2377
03:04:39,520 --> 03:04:41,460
What how did it fail?

2378
03:04:47,750 --> 03:04:49,090
When did it trigger it?

2379
03:04:50,290 --> 03:04:50,290

03:05:10,420 --> 03:05:11,860
I fucking told you.

2384
03:05:12,240 --> 03:05:13,600
I knew it.

2385
03:05:15,380 --> 03:05:15,860
Okay.

2386
03:05:16,000 --> 03:05:17,360
I just don't have intelligence.

2387
03:05:17,960 --> 03:05:19,520
It won't go on the other side, right?

2388
03:05:21,980 --> 03:05:23,480
Guys, it's not going to go.

2389
03:05:29,520 --> 03:05:30,860
Guys, it's not going to go.

2390
03:05:33,280 --> 03:05:35,240
It's because he got healed.

2391
03:05:38,340 --> 03:05:40,400
Yeah, but then the defense.

2392
03:05:41,320 --> 03:05:45,360
I'm scared about the vigor and the intelligence guys

2393
03:05:51,710 --> 03:05:54,430
Oh there's no intelligence okay

50, maybe 60% of the city is dead.

2401
03:07:06,240 --> 03:07:07,100
But it's okay.

2402
03:07:07,500 --> 03:07:08,140

We'll be fine.

2405
03:07:11,560 --> 03:07:13,380
The red ring has overwhelmed me.

I don't think Sonar is going to get it.

2429
03:09:12,940 --> 03:09:14,580
Sonar is not defusing anything.

2430
03:09:15,160 --> 03:09:16,560
Someone's messing with our systems.

2431
03:09:17,440 --> 03:09:18,000

03:13:17,940 --> 03:13:18,760
Fuck it.

2469
03:13:19,680 --> 03:13:21,600
Let's just expand though.

2470
03:13:21,960 --> 03:13:23,420
They burned down Los Amigos.

2471
03:13:24,560 --> 03:13:27,200
And no one else gets the Tostata shell as crispy.

2472
03:13:27,380 --> 03:13:28,060
Send you.

2473
03:13:28,920 --> 03:13:29,440
You know what?

2474
03:13:29,460 --> 03:13:30,860
Why do I go in there?

2475
03:13:31,600 --> 03:13:33,000
Don't even try it.

2476
03:13:33,140 --> 03:13:34,280
On top of the morning.

2477
03:13:39,220 --> 03:13:42,280
Oh, I'm so sad.

2478
03:13:42,540 --> 03:13:44,220
I thought our old commute was shit.

2479
03:13:44,500 --> 03:13:45,720
I'm so sad.

2480
03:13:46,120 --> 03:13:48,220
I'm so fucking sad.

2481
03:13:49,060 --> 03:13:50,580
I'm so unlucky.

2482
03:13:51,380 --> 03:13:53,000
How am I that unlucky?

2483
03:13:55,420 --> 03:13:57,320
Top of the morning to you.

2484
03:13:57,640 --> 03:13:58,320
Which uh.

2485
03:14:00,100 --> 03:14:02,360
Alright, I mean, there's no way I failed this.

2486
03:14:02,660 --> 03:14:04,460
I'm going to take up the entire grid.

2487
03:14:07,700 --> 03:14:11,760
Yeah, I covered the entire grid on a single call.

2488
03:14:14,560 --> 03:14:14,900
Come on.

2489
03:14:15,480 --> 03:14:17,380
Thank God you're not depressed anymore.

2490
03:14:18,660 --> 03:14:20,600
This is the longest night shift of my life.

2491
03:14:20,680 --> 03:14:22,060
I have to know what this is.

2492
03:14:44,500 --> 03:14:45,300
It's made it!

2493
03:14:45,540 --> 03:14:46,820
I made it!

2494
03:14:52,550 --> 03:14:53,990
I don't think so.

2495
03:14:54,350 --> 03:14:56,610
Okay, okay, we've made it in.

Oh no, we don't have we don't have second chance.

2500
03:16:12,130 --> 03:16:13,450
Oh no, he's out.

2501
03:16:14,030 --> 03:16:15,770
Our smartest man is out.

2502
03:16:17,890 --> 03:16:20,170
I thought they aren't supposed to be quitters.

2503
03:16:20,550 --> 03:16:21,390
Get your shit in gear.

2504
03:16:23,230 --> 03:16:24,490
Oh no, we have to send Malin.

2505
03:16:25,170 --> 03:16:25,430
Okay.

2506
03:16:28,810 --> 03:16:30,330
Okay, we gotta boost you up.

2507
03:16:30,530 --> 03:16:33,610
You are the smartest guy left that we have.

2508
03:16:35,210 --> 03:16:37,230
You have to be our guy.

2509
03:16:58,320 --> 03:16:59,200
There's no way.

2510
03:17:21,780 --> 03:17:23,360
I got

2511
03:17:28,470 --> 03:17:29,750
15%!

2512
03:17:32,610 --> 03:17:39,110
That's happened two times!

2513
03:17:49,560 --> 03:17:52,980
I don't think I can salvage this guy.

2514
03:17:59,900 --> 03:18:04,330
I don't know if I can...

2515
03:18:04,870 --> 03:18:06,690
Oh my god.

2516
03:18:08,630 --> 03:18:09,830
Bad!

2517
03:18:16,210 --> 03:18:17,010
This is...

2518
03:18:43,430 --> 03:18:43,910
Ow!

2519
03:18:57,910 --> 03:18:59,110
Okay.

2520
03:19:00,390 --> 03:19:00,810
Okay.

2521
03:19:01,490 --> 03:19:01,990
Okay!

2522
03:19:02,530 --> 03:19:04,890
This is...

2523
03:19:04,890 --> 03:19:05,530
Overall!

2524
03:19:06,490 --> 03:19:07,890
That's fine.

2525
03:19:10,930 --> 03:19:11,250
Okay.

2526
03:19:11,650 --> 03:19:12,430
Scanning by.

2527
03:19:13,030 --> 03:19:14,710
I can heal him.

2528
03:19:19,800 --> 03:19:21,640
Okay, again.

2529
03:19:23,180 --> 03:19:25,540
Again, we go.

2530
03:19:30,780 --> 03:19:32,060
Just restart.

2531
03:19:33,400 --> 03:19:38,140
I guess LA doesn't want to get saved.

2532
03:19:40,200 --> 03:19:42,120
No, no, it'll be fine.

2533
03:19:42,400 --> 03:19:42,860
He's not.

2534
03:19:43,060 --> 03:19:45,700
Depression man is no longer depressed.

2535
03:19:46,260 --> 03:19:47,880
We can stop her.

2536
03:19:49,400 --> 03:19:52,860
Serves you right for cutting Cupid the first.

2537
03:19:52,880 --> 03:19:53,500
place.

2538
03:19:54,200 --> 03:19:55,720
God, thank you for the super chat.

2539
03:19:56,000 --> 03:19:56,580
Thank you.

2540
03:19:56,880 --> 03:20:01,260
I'm, the thing is, we've been doing this for so long.

2541
03:20:01,680 --> 03:20:02,040
Nothing.

2542
03:20:02,380 --> 03:20:03,280
Like, this is it.

2543
03:20:03,360 --> 03:20:05,640
This is the only thing we're waiting on.

2544
03:20:08,880 --> 03:20:10,020
There's no way.

2545
03:20:10,560 --> 03:20:11,680
There's no way.

2546
03:20:11,760 --> 03:20:12,640
Okay, thank God.

2547
03:20:12,740 --> 03:20:13,160
Thank God.

2548
03:20:13,400 --> 03:20:18,000
I was gonna say, if I fuck up the 90%, there is just pull this off.

2549
03:20:18,260 --> 03:20:18,500
Come on.

2550
03:20:18,640 --> 03:20:19,600
There's no way.

2551
03:20:19,720 --> 03:20:22,100
This is literally it's just me and her.

2552
03:20:22,480 --> 03:20:50,240
Give her everything you've got can i say oh god okay no i can't what if he leaves i hope one day i will be can i send blonde blazer can i send her i need a no i need a no if you are sure i'm willing

2553
03:20:55,860 --> 03:21:07,620
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, I've like, I've been stuck in this area for so fucking long to a point where they stopped giving me missions.

2554
03:21:08,280 --> 03:21:09,920
It's literally just Koop.

2555
03:21:10,240 --> 03:21:12,680
I've been stuck on her for so long.

2556
03:21:13,200 --> 03:21:15,640
I don't even get missions anymore.

2557
03:21:20,220 --> 03:21:23,660
I don't even get missions anymore.

2558
03:21:25,200 --> 03:21:30,340
Ben has been drifting around here for 20 years because I'm worried he's gonna get depressed.

2559
03:21:30,460 --> 03:21:31,560
I'm not.

2560
03:21:34,820 --> 03:21:36,900
Oh my God.

2561
03:21:41,240 --> 03:21:44,120
And his name is not Togeeper.

2562
03:21:44,600 --> 03:21:48,240
I failed at 80% chance.

2563
03:21:49,860 --> 03:21:52,360
Like three times.

2564
03:21:52,880 --> 03:21:53,880
Take a deep breath.

2565
03:21:54,880 --> 03:21:56,560
Hey, great work team.

2566
03:21:56,560 --> 03:22:01,360
The entire city of LA versus one woman.

2567
03:22:02,600 --> 03:22:06,920
70% of the citizens of LA has died, but it's okay.

2568
03:22:07,400 --> 03:22:08,120
Not good, bro.

2569
03:22:12,620 --> 03:22:16,320
I even failed at 95%.

2570
03:22:16,320 --> 03:22:18,440
That's crazy.

2571
03:22:21,740 --> 03:22:22,180
Chase.

2572
03:22:24,120 --> 03:22:24,500
Solid.

2573
03:22:24,780 --> 03:22:25,680
Thank you for the super chat.

2574
03:22:26,060 --> 03:22:26,600
Thank you.

2575
03:22:26,880 --> 03:22:30,000
Try an exorcism or getting your house cleansed by preschoolers.

2576
03:22:30,040 --> 03:22:33,740
Because what the actual fuck you need?

2577
03:22:34,920 --> 03:22:37,020
Bro, I've been so unlucky this year.

2578
03:22:37,120 --> 03:22:38,920
This year has actually been so bad to me.

2579
03:22:55,340 --> 03:22:56,260
He's fine.

2580
03:22:56,840 --> 03:22:57,000
Oh.

2581
03:23:04,890 --> 03:23:05,830
It seems okay.

2582
03:23:05,970 --> 03:23:06,810
All right, take care of him.

2583
03:23:17,910 --> 03:23:18,390
What?

2584
03:23:19,290 --> 03:23:20,830
Ah, I trusted you, Vizzi.

2585
03:23:21,590 --> 03:23:22,630
You were wrong for this.

2586
03:23:22,890 --> 03:23:24,450
I'd defend it for you.

2587
03:23:24,450 --> 03:23:25,770
Put me down.

2588
03:23:26,110 --> 03:23:27,550
I didn't do anything.

2589
03:23:28,050 --> 03:23:30,430
No, no, I caught you.

2590
03:23:30,770 --> 03:23:32,110
I caught you red-handed.

2591
03:23:32,490 --> 03:23:33,630
Let's go of there.

2592
03:23:33,770 --> 03:23:35,850
If I was doing that, use your head.

2593
03:23:36,410 --> 03:23:36,770
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2594
03:23:36,770 --> 03:23:37,710
Oh, this before Bros.

2595
03:23:38,350 --> 03:23:40,350
Roy, let her go, man.

2596
03:23:40,650 --> 03:23:41,090
No, brother.

2597
03:23:41,790 --> 03:23:42,690
She ain't going nowhere.

2598
03:23:43,870 --> 03:23:45,230
She tries to steal your mech suits.

2599
03:23:45,610 --> 03:23:46,530
Oh, fuck off.

2600
03:23:46,610 --> 03:23:47,670
And break my heart, brother.

2601
03:23:48,390 --> 03:23:49,510
But Vizzy is a traitor.

2602
03:23:50,150 --> 03:23:51,390
She played all of us.

2603
03:23:51,750 --> 03:23:52,830
That's not what I was doing.

2604
03:23:52,890 --> 03:23:54,450
I'm trying to help you.

2605
03:23:54,630 --> 03:23:55,830
I trusted you.

2606
03:23:57,770 --> 03:23:59,710
Wait, is Roy a bad guy?

2607
03:24:00,530 --> 03:24:01,530
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2608
03:24:06,250 --> 03:24:06,710
Holy shit.

2609
03:24:08,730 --> 03:24:09,810
Is that the real?

2610
03:24:12,730 --> 03:24:15,630
She bring the keys to steer the car, but I stop her.

2611
03:24:15,710 --> 03:24:17,370
You fucking idiots!

2612
03:24:17,810 --> 03:24:18,690
You need me!

2613
03:24:18,830 --> 03:24:19,750
You brought the Astropulse.

2614
03:24:20,250 --> 03:24:21,210
You already do enough.

2615
03:24:21,290 --> 03:24:22,290
You don't know what's coming.

2616
03:24:22,890 --> 03:24:23,490
What are you talking about?

2617
03:24:29,330 --> 03:24:31,510
Oh, what?

2618
03:24:31,870 --> 03:24:32,410
We're here?

2619
03:24:38,960 --> 03:24:40,420
I thought she was cool.

2620
03:24:44,870 --> 03:24:45,970
Oh, there's cool.

2621
03:24:46,090 --> 03:24:47,450
But I beat you up.

2622
03:24:50,490 --> 03:24:50,970
Fuck.

2623
03:24:51,430 --> 03:24:52,150
We under attack.

2624
03:24:52,550 --> 03:24:52,910
Watch her.

2625
03:24:53,310 --> 03:24:54,110
Don't get the power back.

2626
03:24:54,770 --> 03:24:55,690
You need my help.

2627
03:24:55,990 --> 03:24:56,730
You helped enough.

2628
03:24:57,450 --> 03:24:57,790

2629
03:24:58,030 --> 03:24:58,190
No.

2630
03:24:58,390 --> 03:24:58,650
Wait.

2631
03:24:59,970 --> 03:25:01,290

03:25:33,230 --> 03:25:33,950
Of course they did.

2635
03:25:34,690 --> 03:25:35,490
But I said no.

2636
03:25:35,970 --> 03:25:36,170
Bullshit.

2637
03:25:36,870 --> 03:25:37,130
Watch her.

I go get the power back on.

2639
03:25:39,930 --> 03:25:42,210
I moved your Mechaman suit to the rec room.

2640
03:25:42,830 --> 03:25:42,890
Here.

2641
03:25:44,850 --> 03:25:45,270

A taser.

2643
03:25:50,170 --> 03:25:51,610
We're fighting the red ring, right?

2644
03:25:51,970 --> 03:25:53,390

Thank you, dingy.

2647
03:25:57,350 --> 03:25:58,410

2650
03:26:48,440 --> 03:26:49,580
he'd have the pulse right now.

2651
03:26:51,700 --> 03:26:53,980
I was trying to protect you.

2652
03:26:54,420 --> 03:26:56,040
Oh, that's so sweet.

2653
03:26:56,160 --> 03:26:58,140
The internal bleeding I've got from your old boss.

2654
03:26:58,520 --> 03:26:59,560
Yeah, but at least I didn't die.

2655
03:26:59,740 --> 03:27:00,820
You did great, girl.

2656
03:27:02,620 --> 03:27:04,760
Thanks for giving me internal bleeding.

2657
03:27:04,900 --> 03:27:06,300
At least I didn't die.

2658
03:27:06,680 --> 03:27:07,140
Thumbstick.

2659
03:27:07,760 --> 03:27:07,900
What?

2660
03:27:08,360 --> 03:27:10,820
It's his name because he sticks you with...

2661
03:27:11,560 --> 03:27:11,780
What?

2662
03:27:11,960 --> 03:27:12,340
Thumbs?

2663
03:27:12,660 --> 03:27:13,340
There are fucking idiots, Robert.

2664
03:27:13,460 --> 03:27:14,100
I'm dangerous.

2665
03:27:14,940 --> 03:27:16,480
I'm fucking around to untie me.

2666
03:27:16,820 --> 03:27:18,540
He looks stupid, but he is a killer.

2667
03:27:19,180 --> 03:27:20,440
You don't have powers.

2668
03:27:20,880 --> 03:27:21,780
You need my help.

2669
03:27:22,260 --> 03:27:23,120
I'm tired.

2670
03:27:23,720 --> 03:27:24,640
No hesitation.

2671
03:27:25,480 --> 03:27:27,420
Two versus one is better.

2672
03:27:27,760 --> 03:27:28,620
Two be one.

2673
03:27:30,460 --> 03:27:33,780
I'm looking for something to cut you loose, but his toolboxes are locked.

2674
03:27:34,540 --> 03:27:35,500
What did he do that for?

2675
03:27:35,940 --> 03:27:36,980
Oh, I fucking wonder, Vizzy.

2676
03:27:37,080 --> 03:27:39,740
Why would he lock up his tools around invisible criminal thieves?

2677
03:27:41,000 --> 03:27:41,440
Robert.

2678
03:27:43,900 --> 03:27:46,160
Boy, there's a lot of people coming down now.

2681
03:28:21,880 --> 03:28:22,360

What?

2683
03:28:24,320 --> 03:28:25,360
Did he not see me?

2684
03:28:25,560 --> 03:28:26,140
What the fuck was that?

2685
03:28:33,480 --> 03:28:35,980
He needs to use the bathroom.

2686
03:28:36,760 --> 03:28:37,960
I hate

2687
03:28:43,070 --> 03:28:43,590
this place.

2688
03:28:43,830 --> 03:28:44,330
God, come on.

2689
03:28:44,610 --> 03:28:44,870
Open it.

2690
03:28:45,590 --> 03:28:45,950
Come on.

2691
03:28:48,360 --> 03:28:49,260
Alright, alright.

2692
03:28:49,380 --> 03:28:49,980
Fuck it.

2693
03:28:50,220 --> 03:28:50,320
Okay.

2694
03:28:51,000 --> 03:28:51,160
Okay.

2695
03:28:51,600 --> 03:28:54,220
Well, why don't you pee before you come here?

2696
03:28:56,660 --> 03:28:57,560
Oh, shit.

2697
03:28:57,680 --> 03:28:59,440
While they're peeing, I feel like I should...

2698
03:28:59,440 --> 03:29:00,920
I feel like I should get the gun for you.

2699
03:29:02,240 --> 03:29:05,580
oh i would i could like it would shock his dick though

2700
03:29:10,440 --> 03:29:53,850

2701
03:29:57,020 --> 03:30:04,980

2702
03:30:05,500 --> 03:30:07,290
I hate it when she does that.

2703
03:30:11,400 --> 03:30:12,900
Why did no one shoot him?

2704
03:30:16,200 --> 03:30:18,000
Robert is now gay.

2705
03:30:20,180 --> 03:30:21,000
That's all it takes.

2706
03:30:22,860 --> 03:30:26,360
You touch one ball, and now you're gay.

2707
03:30:33,360 --> 03:30:35,240
It's the gateway drug.

2708
03:30:42,130 --> 03:30:43,150
That's the raw.

2709
03:30:55,000 --> 03:30:56,860
He had a gateway drug.

2710
03:31:04,770 --> 03:31:07,470
Not the only one guy has a gun.

2711
03:31:07,650 --> 03:31:08,250
Oh, there it is.

2712
03:31:08,390 --> 03:31:10,470
God, these guys are really bad shots.

2713
03:31:13,290 --> 03:31:16,310
Like, they have literal enhancers, you know?

2714
03:31:17,250 --> 03:31:19,190
Clearly it doesn't enhance the aim.

2715
03:31:30,020 --> 03:31:31,040
I did it.

2716
03:31:32,160 --> 03:31:35,120
It might have accidentally shot him, but I did it.

2717
03:31:39,670 --> 03:31:40,710
Mecha man

2718
03:31:48,490 --> 03:33:08,730

Oh shit, what the fuck?

2720
03:33:28,190 --> 03:33:36,290
Your dad said he'd help me build a Mac If I helped him build the Astral Pulse Just another promise he didn't control on I told you!

2721
03:33:36,910 --> 03:33:37,830
I knew it!

2722
03:33:37,950 --> 03:33:39,610
How are your stupid spider shit?

2723
03:33:39,890 --> 03:33:41,590
I've said it in the beginning!

2724
03:33:42,690 --> 03:33:43,810
I knew he made...

2725
03:33:43,810 --> 03:33:48,250
I had a feeling he made the Astral Pulse It's like plugging your cell phone into a nuclear reactor.

2726
03:33:51,350 --> 03:34:05,240
you're dead i knew it is going to be hard to pull off after i kill you huh oh they don't like that how did he know

2728
03:34:36,840 --> 03:34:57,820
that quick time event confused me it was so fast you are right brother gun versus sword let's go it is cooler though cluster bomb that's looking right you're

2729
03:35:01,300 --> 03:35:04,840
trying yet or is this just a warm-up round

2730
03:35:07,960 --> 03:35:10,050
Bro, he's stream sniping me.

2731
03:35:12,940 --> 03:35:14,580
He's, like, screen peeking.

2732
03:35:17,420 --> 03:35:19,440
Okay, he's a lot bigger.

2733
03:35:19,720 --> 03:35:21,820
Still got that new car shine.

2734
03:35:24,660 --> 03:35:25,780
Blonde Blazer!

2735
03:35:28,180 --> 03:35:29,540
You are late.

2736
03:35:30,620 --> 03:35:33,240
My calculations are just showing up 30 seconds ago.

2737
03:35:33,500 --> 03:35:33,600
Oh.

2738
03:35:34,140 --> 03:35:35,900
Sorry to disappoint.

2739
03:35:36,040 --> 03:35:37,500
Oh, never mind.

2740
03:35:38,080 --> 03:35:40,960
I can't tell you how boring life is without surprises.

2741
03:35:43,080 --> 03:35:46,100
Well, then it's a good thing I can't even predict what these idiots are gonna do.

2742
03:35:48,440 --> 03:35:49,700
Wait, the Z-Team?

2743
03:35:51,420 --> 03:35:52,000
Oh!

2744
03:35:52,280 --> 03:35:53,480
Oh, it's Prism!

2745
03:35:58,060 --> 03:35:59,120
Let's go!

2746
03:36:03,720 --> 03:36:04,780
Z-Team!

2747
03:36:06,040 --> 03:36:08,120
What's the power of friendship?

2748
03:36:09,220 --> 03:36:12,620
Oh, yeah, no, he's dead.

2749
03:36:12,980 --> 03:36:14,540
Yeah, no, he's fucking dead.

2750
03:36:15,740 --> 03:36:17,060
Z team assemble.

2751
03:36:20,260 --> 03:36:21,300
Okay, baby.

2752
03:36:21,540 --> 03:36:31,420
Okay, I'm more aware now of these quick time events.

2753
03:36:36,040 --> 03:36:37,480
Bro, it doesn't even matter.

2754
03:36:37,620 --> 03:36:38,920
They just dodge everything.

2755
03:36:40,740 --> 03:36:42,320
Oh god, Waterboy.

2756
03:36:43,340 --> 03:36:45,140
Oh, man.

2757
03:36:48,910 --> 03:36:50,440
Damn, Waterboy.

2758
03:36:55,640 --> 03:36:57,520
Oh, shit.

2759
03:37:11,960 --> 03:37:13,380
Oh my god, reflection!

2760
03:37:13,900 --> 03:37:15,380
With the power of Wainbles!

2761
03:37:17,880 --> 03:37:19,580
He touched one ball.

2762
03:37:21,440 --> 03:37:22,620
Now it's everywhere.

2763
03:37:24,140 --> 03:37:25,060
Do you mean I hit?

2764
03:37:25,380 --> 03:37:26,220
How am I too slow?

2765
03:37:26,440 --> 03:37:27,060
I hit it!

2766
03:37:28,640 --> 03:37:30,600
I actually hit it!

2767
03:37:34,580 --> 03:37:37,320
What happens when I don't hit the quick time event?

2768
03:37:37,760 --> 03:37:38,920
It can't be slow anymore!

2769
03:37:38,940 --> 03:37:41,300
I hope my saving from collision was abrupt.

2770
03:37:41,340 --> 03:37:43,780
It was phenomenal

2771
03:37:51,600 --> 03:38:01,360
Oh shit Nice nice shot You know I I definitely had that Oh, great.

2772
03:38:01,540 --> 03:38:04,700
Well, I'll just go then Bro, no jokes guys.

2773
03:38:04,900 --> 03:38:14,900
We're fighting people Guys come by finished our dance mecha man actually I I got the guy for you.

2774
03:38:16,740 --> 03:38:17,220
Oh.

2775
03:38:17,360 --> 03:38:17,580
Wow.

2776
03:38:17,780 --> 03:38:21,200
You really think this little fucking lucky charm is a match for me?

2777
03:38:21,580 --> 03:38:22,780
He's got a special move.

2778
03:38:22,900 --> 03:38:23,180
What is it?

2779
03:38:23,220 --> 03:38:24,080
Oh, ball punch!

2780
03:38:24,880 --> 03:38:26,560
Oh, because his dick's out.

2781
03:38:28,680 --> 03:38:30,840
No, ending the bloodline today.

2782
03:38:31,620 --> 03:38:33,060
Where did you come from?

2783
03:38:34,040 --> 03:38:34,920
Oh, shit.

2784
03:38:35,300 --> 03:38:36,940
He didn't calculate this.

2785
03:38:43,670 --> 03:38:44,890
I see you.

2786
03:38:45,950 --> 03:38:46,890
He's a bull.

2787
03:38:48,870 --> 03:38:50,630
He should be fine, right?

2788
03:38:51,850 --> 03:38:53,130
Robert, this isn't working.

2789
03:38:53,510 --> 03:38:57,110
He knows our next move before we- Oh, he keeps stream sniping us.

2790
03:38:59,450 --> 03:39:00,390
Oh, no.

2791
03:39:00,890 --> 03:39:01,750
Oh, no, it's cool.

2792
03:39:07,070 --> 03:39:08,290
Wait, what do we do?

2793
03:39:08,530 --> 03:39:10,430
I've never been more insulted in my life.

2794
03:39:11,270 --> 03:39:15,590
You fire me, a literal assassin for some moronic bumble.

2795
03:39:15,610 --> 03:39:17,370
Yeah, but he has a degree.

2796
03:39:18,170 --> 03:39:19,090
Did you know that?

2797
03:39:19,550 --> 03:39:21,430
Ask the cleaners how much guano they come across.

2798
03:39:22,050 --> 03:39:23,850
Looks like I was right, though.

2799
03:39:25,250 --> 03:39:27,850
By the looks of things, I made the right decision.

2800
03:39:27,930 --> 03:39:28,450
That's right.

2801
03:39:28,910 --> 03:39:31,370
He has a very successful YouTube channel.

2802
03:39:31,970 --> 03:39:33,090
What do you have?

2803
03:39:36,070 --> 03:39:37,870
Yeah, do you have a degree?

2804
03:39:39,250 --> 03:39:40,470
I hit it!

2805
03:39:40,790 --> 03:39:43,050
What happens if I don't hit it?

2806
03:39:45,050 --> 03:39:45,590
What's the point?

2807
03:39:45,610 --> 03:40:03,210
point of me succeeding quick time events if i still get it you're not the boss of me so you don't get to tell me who and who not to murder anymore hey we're your friends please this isn't you help us stop shroud and earn your spot back on the z team

2808
03:40:11,790 --> 03:40:22,070
that's where you're wrong i thought i had friends but you made me realize i never actually did I'm just doing what's right for me.

2809
03:40:23,430 --> 03:40:24,310
Oh shit.

2810
03:40:26,870 --> 03:40:27,430
Z Team.

2811
03:40:28,690 --> 03:40:29,590
What a stupid name.

2812
03:40:29,970 --> 03:40:31,050
Yeah, you're stupid.

2813
03:40:36,190 --> 03:40:38,750
Nah, I'm not fix- I have to fix someone else right now.

2814
03:40:38,930 --> 03:40:39,970
I can't fix two people.

2815
03:40:41,930 --> 03:40:43,650
I'll try to get you an opening.

2816
03:40:46,390 --> 03:40:48,050
Guys, I can't fix everyone.

2817
03:40:49,690 --> 03:40:51,050
I bought my limits.

2818
03:40:56,150 --> 03:40:58,410
One lady per fix.

2819
03:41:07,810 --> 03:41:08,650
There you go.

2820
03:41:09,690 --> 03:41:10,890
Five wings.

2821
03:41:14,430 --> 03:41:16,970
Is she gonna die?

2822
03:41:19,410 --> 03:41:20,450
Oh, oh.

2823
03:41:21,610 --> 03:41:23,110
Wait, but I hit it.

2824
03:41:25,810 --> 03:41:27,710
Did not hit it?

2825
03:41:28,250 --> 03:41:30,410
Come on, come on.

2826
03:41:31,250 --> 03:41:32,530
Oh shit!

2827
03:41:46,440 --> 03:41:47,040
Yay!

2828
03:41:48,820 --> 03:41:50,020
Flying people.

2829
03:41:50,800 --> 03:41:51,340
Okay, stay focused.

2830
03:41:51,460 --> 03:41:52,560
Sorry, I'm gonna stay focused.

2831
03:41:53,940 --> 03:41:54,620
Get him out!

2832
03:42:02,220 --> 03:42:03,300
Y'all forever.

2833
03:42:08,540 --> 03:42:08,980
Oh,

2834
03:42:13,480 --> 03:42:13,480
shit.

2835
03:42:13,940 --> 03:42:14,600
Bye, arm.

2836
03:42:16,320 --> 03:42:17,000
Calm down.

2837
03:42:17,140 --> 03:42:18,060
It was your weak hand.

2838
03:42:18,240 --> 03:42:19,200
You can still jerk off.

2839
03:42:21,580 --> 03:42:23,980
Maybe if you grip it with the seven button, hold it with.

2840
03:42:25,200 --> 03:42:25,820
Yeah, you know what?

2841
03:42:25,840 --> 03:42:26,300
Fair enough.

2842
03:42:27,340 --> 03:42:28,920
It's not even his real arm.

2843
03:42:29,000 --> 03:42:29,640
He's fine.

2844
03:42:31,480 --> 03:42:32,040
Let's

2845
03:42:36,480 --> 03:42:37,820
attach another arm.

2846
03:42:47,400 --> 03:42:47,560
What?

2847
03:42:51,390 --> 03:42:51,950
No!

2848
03:42:52,610 --> 03:42:53,690
Oh, he wanted...

2849
03:42:53,690 --> 03:42:53,910
Oh!

2850
03:43:07,460 --> 03:43:08,720
He'll be fine, right?

2851
03:43:13,160 --> 03:43:14,540
Oh my god.

2852
03:43:16,000 --> 03:43:17,320
I'm trying to find...

2853
03:43:19,000 --> 03:43:20,880
I'm locking in so hard.

2854
03:43:21,820 --> 03:43:23,900

Blazer.

2859
03:44:13,060 --> 03:44:14,200
What the fuck happened?

2860
03:44:14,780 --> 03:44:15,760
Wait, she...

2861
03:44:15,760 --> 03:44:17,700
You're not the only one who wasn't born with powers.

2862
03:44:19,120 --> 03:44:21,160
Wait, she gave it to Chase?

2863
03:44:23,460 --> 03:44:24,240
Holy shit.

2864
03:44:25,080 --> 03:44:25,480
Look at you.

2865
03:44:25,740 --> 03:44:26,860
Oh, look at you.

2866
03:44:27,200 --> 03:44:27,620
Oh, shit.

2867
03:44:27,920 --> 03:44:28,340
Yeah, look at me.

2868
03:44:28,780 --> 03:44:28,920
Shit.

2869
03:44:29,140 --> 03:44:29,600
No, look out.

2870
03:44:33,840 --> 03:44:36,600
She's not a muscle bot.

2871
03:44:36,740 --> 03:44:37,680
Everything was a lie.

2872
03:44:38,740 --> 03:44:40,200
Everything was a fucking lie.

2873
03:44:40,740 --> 03:44:43,020
She was never a muscle mommy.

2874
03:44:43,140 --> 03:44:46,080
There's always to have a soft spot for helpless losers.

2875
03:44:46,840 --> 03:44:47,940
Fuck off.

2876
03:44:56,460 --> 03:44:58,160
It's so over.

2877
03:45:12,630 --> 03:45:13,890
Oh, shit.

2878
03:45:15,410 --> 03:45:16,090
Fascinated.

2879
03:45:19,330 --> 03:45:21,110
I guess, I don't know how he didn't.

2880
03:45:21,130 --> 03:45:21,870
predict the old.

2881
03:45:21,950 --> 03:45:25,450
I guess he didn't think the old man was in the equation.

2882
03:45:30,560 --> 03:45:31,080
Fuck.

2883
03:45:31,420 --> 03:45:32,980
I'm going to make love to you.

2884
03:45:35,520 --> 03:45:36,620
You a hoi.

2885
03:45:37,200 --> 03:45:38,440
You're such a hoi.

2886
03:45:38,880 --> 03:45:40,040
Bro, you just hugged everyone?

2887
03:45:40,920 --> 03:45:42,440
I thought we were special.

2888
03:45:47,270 --> 03:45:48,450
Oh my god.

2889
03:45:48,590 --> 03:45:49,630
We're not special.

2890
03:45:51,510 --> 03:45:53,590
Oh, you didn't know about Blazor's powers.

2891
03:45:53,810 --> 03:45:54,330
Oh.

2892
03:45:56,870 --> 03:45:57,930
I see.

2893
03:45:59,130 --> 03:46:02,790
You didn't realize what Blazer's actual powers come from.

2894
03:46:10,870 --> 03:46:13,730
Wait, why did the middle finger get sentry?

2895
03:46:14,190 --> 03:46:16,330
I said profanity okay.

2896
03:46:21,610 --> 03:46:22,070
Oh, shit.

2897
03:46:22,570 --> 03:46:23,790
I looked at chat for one second.

2898
03:46:31,310 --> 03:46:33,010
Super Spirit Bomb!

2899
03:46:36,210 --> 03:46:36,630
Yeah!

2900
03:46:44,450 --> 03:46:45,830
Raise your hands!

2901
03:47:01,360 --> 03:47:04,040
We fucked them in the face.

2902
03:47:06,420 --> 03:47:09,480
That's what I'm talking about, brother.

2903
03:47:09,880 --> 03:47:10,300
That's it?

2904
03:47:10,680 --> 03:47:11,320
Let's go again.

2905
03:47:11,780 --> 03:47:12,600
Anybody want to go again?

2906
03:47:12,800 --> 03:47:13,000
Yeah.

2907
03:47:13,780 --> 03:47:14,600
You're alive.

2908
03:47:15,100 --> 03:47:15,520
Nice.

2909
03:47:15,940 --> 03:47:16,760
I like how...

2910
03:47:16,760 --> 03:47:17,000
Yeah.

2911
03:47:17,080 --> 03:47:19,340
It changes the hairstyle, too.

2912
03:47:21,880 --> 03:47:23,400
Oh, nice ass.

2913
03:47:23,660 --> 03:47:24,960
Soccer player is going through something.

2914
03:47:29,440 --> 03:47:30,000
Oh.

2915
03:47:30,460 --> 03:47:31,140
Beef!

2916
03:47:32,740 --> 03:47:33,420
Well,

2917
03:47:36,520 --> 03:47:37,580
that is a surprise.

2918
03:47:38,340 --> 03:47:39,940
How did he get...

2919
03:47:39,940 --> 03:47:41,880
How did he get to feed?

2920
03:47:42,300 --> 03:47:43,140
This fat buck.

2921
03:47:43,980 --> 03:47:44,200
Like this.

2922
03:47:44,220 --> 03:47:44,560
No!

2923
03:47:49,270 --> 03:47:50,750
Why is everyone so good?

2924
03:47:50,770 --> 03:48:53,550

03:49:00,490 --> 03:49:10,210
give me my fucking astral pulse you can still watch you got his dick punched

2926
03:49:19,060 --> 03:49:23,220
or a dog don't be shy

2927
03:49:42,260 --> 03:50:51,780
sloppy guy is your weakness I knew you'd fall for what is it you call her in physical you knew and she'd steal that soft heart of yours like everything else she's robbed bro that's why we planted her here she thought she had a chance with me she she thought she had a chance she's like what you hooked up with envisagat and not me she works for us too she gets two paychecks for the same job look at her oh she's embarrassed so all that to say there isn't a thing you can do that i haven't modeled out and once i have the pulse i won't need to predict i'll just know so don't around robert not right now what she didn't love me but like did you make her have those sexy dreams about me too monster same time i just want a fair exchange just don't be

2928
03:50:54,800 --> 03:50:58,440
I'm a bad person, but I'm a man of my word.

2929
03:50:59,400 --> 03:51:03,060
Give me my pulse, and no harm will come to your stupid dog.

2930
03:51:03,740 --> 03:51:04,860
You all hear that?

2931
03:51:05,920 --> 03:51:06,240
Oh.

2932
03:51:08,720 --> 03:51:11,940
I've been through all the game theory on this moment a thousand times.

2933
03:51:12,260 --> 03:51:13,520
That's the game theory.

2934
03:51:13,680 --> 03:51:14,460
That's the theory.

2935
03:51:15,060 --> 03:51:17,980
I'm gonna

2936
03:51:22,320 --> 03:51:24,900
give him both.

2937
03:51:27,420 --> 03:51:28,900
Because one explodes, right?

2938
03:51:29,320 --> 03:51:30,900
So if I give him both, he won't know.

2939
03:51:33,840 --> 03:51:34,960
What the fuck is this, Robert?

2940
03:51:35,360 --> 03:51:37,120
You said you wanted the Astropulse.

2941
03:51:38,220 --> 03:51:39,220
I gave it to you.

2942
03:51:40,000 --> 03:51:41,060
One of those is it.

2943
03:51:41,300 --> 03:51:43,360
They look fucking identical, Robert.

2944
03:51:43,600 --> 03:51:44,900
Look, you're right.

2945
03:51:45,100 --> 03:51:46,400
I can't outsmart you.

2946
03:51:46,420 --> 03:51:48,080
Yeah, but he doesn't remember which one's fake.

2947
03:51:48,260 --> 03:51:48,640
You know what?

2948
03:51:48,640 --> 03:51:49,700
I'm not a smart guy.

2949
03:51:49,840 --> 03:51:50,900
Yeah, I'll be like, I don't know.

2950
03:51:50,980 --> 03:51:55,380
The only way to keep you from knowing what I'm doing is to not have any idea what I'm doing.

2951
03:51:56,060 --> 03:51:57,940
Which is how I feel all the time.

2952
03:51:59,200 --> 03:52:02,940
But I trust my gut and I take my best guess.

2953
03:52:03,300 --> 03:52:04,400
Just like it used to do.

2954
03:52:05,840 --> 03:52:08,600
Before you plugged all those fucking Christmas lights into your head.

2955
03:52:09,560 --> 03:52:11,880
Before you were afraid to make your own decisions.

2956
03:52:12,940 --> 03:52:13,200
Elliot.

2957
03:52:17,640 --> 03:52:18,900
Maybe we wait till we get home?

2958
03:52:19,300 --> 03:52:20,480
Shut the fuck up!

2959
03:52:23,600 --> 03:52:24,720
Yeah, that's right.

2960
03:52:24,820 --> 03:52:26,400
You got RNGs.

2961
03:52:26,920 --> 03:52:29,320
Oh, that was the right one, wasn't it?

2962
03:52:29,340 --> 03:52:29,800
Fuck you.

2963
03:52:32,480 --> 03:52:42,160
Oh Why oh He chose wrong

2964
03:52:53,110 --> 03:53:07,460
You chose poorly I think I rage baited him didn't I That was Worth the waste there's no way he wins the 50 50

2965
03:53:17,080 --> 03:53:18,060
What the fuck?

2966
03:53:18,380 --> 03:53:20,380
Feel that, you fucking fucks.

2967
03:53:20,560 --> 03:53:21,460
I told you.

2968
03:53:22,000 --> 03:53:23,820
I fucking told you, Clouds.

2969
03:53:24,900 --> 03:53:27,140
You feel the power?

2970
03:53:28,340 --> 03:53:29,840
I see it now.

2971
03:53:30,860 --> 03:53:32,020
I can see it all.

2972
03:53:32,580 --> 03:53:34,160
How does he... There's no way.

2973
03:53:34,680 --> 03:53:35,800
There's no way.

2974
03:53:36,040 --> 03:53:36,760
It's not a mutation.

2975
03:53:40,840 --> 03:53:41,560
Every...

2976
03:53:41,560 --> 03:53:44,420
Is that the prototype?

2977
03:53:45,740 --> 03:53:46,460
Fuck!

2978
03:53:47,080 --> 03:53:47,500
Wait.

2979
03:53:48,340 --> 03:53:50,200
Just a hunch, but I'm starting to think that you guessed wrong.

2980
03:53:50,560 --> 03:53:50,800
Yay!

2981
03:53:51,540 --> 03:53:52,820
He lost the gotcha!

2982
03:53:53,320 --> 03:53:54,380
Let's go!

2983
03:53:56,980 --> 03:53:57,900
Let's go!

2984
03:53:58,900 --> 03:54:00,120
We did it!

2985
03:54:00,320 --> 03:54:03,720
If I can't win the gotcha, no one can!

2986
03:54:03,740 --> 03:54:05,140
I just can't beat you.

2987
03:54:05,280 --> 03:54:06,900
You know, someone has to clean it up, right?

2988
03:54:06,920 --> 03:54:08,440
Let's go back and get the other one.

2989
03:54:09,500 --> 03:54:10,720
Don't be mad.

2990
03:54:11,400 --> 03:54:11,940
You lost.

2991
03:54:12,140 --> 03:54:14,160
Your RG is so bad.

2992
03:54:14,580 --> 03:54:15,720
It cursed around you.

2993
03:54:18,240 --> 03:54:19,940

03:54:22,340 --> 03:54:23,380
Someone will save us, right?

2997
03:54:25,400 --> 03:54:26,340
Oh, what?

2998
03:54:29,990 --> 03:54:31,790
She stood in front of the bullet.

2999
03:54:34,210 --> 03:54:34,690
What?

3000
03:54:37,640 --> 03:54:38,740
Oh, it's her shoulder.

3001
03:54:38,840 --> 03:54:39,300
She's fine.

3002
03:54:39,780 --> 03:54:40,500
It's fine.

3003
03:54:40,840 --> 03:54:41,360
It's a shoulder.

3004
03:54:41,680 --> 03:54:42,460
Like, that's just me.

3005
03:54:43,540 --> 03:54:44,040
It's fine.

3006
03:54:52,140 --> 03:54:53,840
It's the shoulder!

3007
03:54:54,260 --> 03:54:55,480
She's okay!

3008
03:54:57,500 --> 03:54:59,140
Oh my god!

3009
03:54:59,580 --> 03:55:01,280
Oh my god!

3010
03:55:01,840 --> 03:55:02,960

3020
03:56:03,910 --> 03:56:06,650
We're not doing Batman rules here.

3021
03:56:07,170 --> 03:56:09,710
From Batman, I've learned that you have to kill.

3022
03:56:15,290 --> 03:56:16,170
Do it.

3023
03:56:18,290 --> 03:56:20,550
It doesn't make it right.

3024
03:56:21,410 --> 03:56:23,910
My grandfather and dad are dead.

3025
03:56:37,830 --> 03:56:41,230
How am I the one on a stretcher when you look like hammered shit?

3026
03:56:41,570 --> 03:56:42,570

I know what you are, you lie.

3037
03:58:06,190 --> 03:58:07,770
You wanted to cut her twice.

3038
03:58:08,350 --> 03:58:09,610
Ha ha ha ha.

3039
03:58:14,630 --> 03:58:14,930

03:58:24,750 --> 03:58:26,290
You're not a bitch, apparently.

3045
03:58:26,610 --> 03:58:28,110
At least, according to them.

3046
03:58:28,510 --> 03:58:29,730
Oh, what do they know?

3047
03:58:30,070 --> 03:58:37,950

3048
03:58:38,050 --> 03:58:38,730
You're a hero!

3049
03:58:39,610 --> 03:58:41,330
Does that make you a hero now?

3050
03:58:41,710 --> 03:58:42,170
No.

3051
03:58:42,690 --> 03:58:48,930

3129
04:05:58,140 --> 04:05:59,780
Took a bullet for you and everything.

Robert sucks.

3139
04:07:23,120 --> 04:07:24,040
I was wrong about business.

3140
04:07:24,500 --> 04:07:25,500
She didn't actually kill me.

3141
04:07:25,620 --> 04:07:26,200
Just almost.

3142
04:07:27,140 --> 04:07:28,500
Now let's see if I can make you throw up.

3143
04:07:29,360 --> 04:07:30,040

how did I somehow end up with a good ending?

3147
04:07:56,610 --> 04:08:00,370
I thought you guys said I'm destined for a bad ending.

3148
04:08:00,830 --> 04:08:02,470
This is pretty good.

3149
04:08:02,850 --> 04:08:06,030
I told you, I'm Robbie.

3152
04:08:36,080 --> 04:08:37,370

3153
04:08:41,770 --> 04:08:43,950
How many endings do they have?

3154
04:08:49,300 --> 04:08:50,900
I don't know.

3155
04:08:51,780 --> 04:08:52,740
Never punished.

3156
04:08:53,140 --> 04:08:53,700
I told you.

3157
04:08:53,860 --> 04:08:54,580
Never punished.

3158
04:08:54,760 --> 04:08:55,240
Oh, two?

3159
04:08:56,000 --> 04:08:56,440
Four?

3160
04:08:56,800 --> 04:08:57,360
Wait, what are...

3161
04:08:57,360 --> 04:08:57,880
Or two?

3162
04:09:00,380 --> 04:09:00,940
Four?

3163
04:09:01,300 --> 04:09:02,620
Is it two or four?

3164
04:09:05,320 --> 04:09:07,060
All right, what are the four endings?

3165
04:09:09,320 --> 04:09:10,740
Was mine the best ending?

3166
04:09:14,660 --> 04:09:18,260
Oh, two romance endings, two good or bad.

3167
04:09:25,540 --> 04:09:26,380
Thought Squad.

3168
04:09:27,000 --> 04:09:28,040
That's a good name.

3169
04:09:33,280 --> 04:09:33,780
Thought Squad.

3170
04:09:35,280 --> 04:09:36,860
Been a nice finishing night game with you, Joki.

3171
04:09:37,080 --> 04:09:39,660
Story was great, but the dispatch gameplay seems disconnected.

3172
04:09:39,940 --> 04:09:41,120
Looking forward to the next game.

3173
04:09:41,240 --> 04:09:41,940

Oh, so the other ending of God was just like, um, um, Invisigal being a villain, right?

3188
04:10:15,900 --> 04:10:20,880
of a whole villain and that would have been the bad ending oh

04:11:43,530 --> 04:11:45,910
I told you I was gonna kill him.

3197

Ah.

3199
04:11:50,950 --> 04:11:52,150
It's complicated.

3200
04:11:53,130 --> 04:11:54,010
Only VC.

Disappointed.

3207
04:12:30,570 --> 04:12:31,310
Nailed me there.

3208
04:12:31,430 --> 04:12:33,810
He got depressed when I needed him the most.

3209
04:12:35,090 --> 04:12:35,210
Right.

3210
04:12:35,310 --> 04:12:36,210
Thank you for the super chat.

04:12:36,770 --> 04:12:37,390
Thank you.

3213
04:12:37,390 --> 04:12:37,410
Thank you.

3214
04:12:37,790 --> 04:12:38,830
D saves the day.

3215
04:12:39,190 --> 04:12:39,770
Yippee.

3216
04:12:42,410 --> 04:12:43,290
We welcome.

3217
04:12:43,470 --> 04:12:45,870
Oh, so 30% didn't pay the bail.

3218
04:12:46,190 --> 04:12:46,670
Unfortunate.

3219
04:12:48,010 --> 04:12:48,830
Went on the coffee.

3220
04:12:50,190 --> 04:12:51,190
Put away.

3221
04:12:52,590 --> 04:12:54,550
Me at 36%.

3222
04:12:54,550 --> 04:12:55,290
Put away.

3223
04:12:55,870 --> 04:12:56,830
It's his D.

3224
04:12:59,430 --> 04:13:29,580
I performed better than 70% Fuck you Still better than 70% of players After everything How No fucking shot That's fucking right I still did better

3225
04:13:33,440 --> 04:13:35,680
There is no way.

3226
04:13:37,260 --> 04:13:37,540
Definitely.

3227
04:13:37,880 --> 04:13:38,560
Thank you, thank you.

3228
04:13:39,020 --> 04:13:39,360
It's funny.

3229
04:13:39,480 --> 04:13:46,380
One is to bribe you for coop, but depending on certain things, bomb bays are still censored to jail.

3230
04:13:46,860 --> 04:13:47,740
Thank you, the super chat.

3231
04:13:47,920 --> 04:13:48,600
Thank you, thank you.

3232
04:13:49,480 --> 04:13:50,160
That's right.

3233
04:13:50,280 --> 04:13:54,320
I lost 380% plus rates and like double.

3234
04:13:54,480 --> 04:13:57,760
By the way, there were ones because Sonar had the double spin ability.

3235
04:13:58,260 --> 04:13:59,940
So there were times where I've lost two.

3236
04:13:59,960 --> 04:14:07,920
280% in a, like, like, twice in one, in one instance, because he has double chance.

3237
04:14:09,040 --> 04:14:10,300
That was the worst part.

3238
04:14:10,460 --> 04:14:12,300
You barely succeeded a call.

3239
04:14:16,520 --> 04:14:19,520
And every man you're a robber always kept everyone guessing what he'll say.

3240
04:14:19,900 --> 04:14:22,900
What he'll say, dude, that's me.

3241
04:14:26,060 --> 04:14:26,880
For him better than...

3242
04:14:26,880 --> 04:14:27,180
Yay!

3243
04:14:27,740 --> 04:14:28,280
Look at that.

3244
04:14:28,460 --> 04:14:30,300
I prefer him better than 7% of theirs.

3245
04:14:31,620 --> 04:14:56,540
ship too you barely succeeded ship was the last episode oh phase two that was phase two i did not feel like the most successful i'm robert i'm robert guys that's insane i can't but i'm so good at this game

3246
04:15:00,500 --> 04:15:27,040
wow that was fun i understand the hype now i had oh yeah um one of my friends um who's obsessed with dispatch i think it was like yesterday they were like oh if you look oh do you see anything funny when you because like you know how everyone has their own like um id um so one of my friends was like told me like oh there's an easter egg uh for the the heroes for their id cards And I was like,

3247
04:15:27,100 --> 04:15:27,860
oh, what do you mean?

3248
04:15:28,220 --> 04:15:34,280
And, like, they, like, sent me a picture of, like, I think, Blonde Blazers ID card.

3249
04:15:34,740 --> 04:15:37,940
And they were like, oh, what does, what do you see?

3250
04:15:38,340 --> 04:15:41,240
And then I was like, boobies, like, instantly.

3251
04:15:42,200 --> 04:15:42,640
Yeah.

3252
04:15:44,000 --> 04:15:47,240
So, yeah, so, like, I, no hesitation.

3253
04:15:47,520 --> 04:15:50,620
And then my friend was like, how did you know that fast?

3254
04:15:50,660 --> 04:15:54,140
And I'm like, because Chad keeps sending me passwords.

3255
04:15:54,560 --> 04:16:29,940
Every time I ask for a password, it chat would be like boobs and i'm like it's not boobs and then my chat would be like boobies so i recognize instantly whenever i see the numbers i can instantly tell if you guys fucking type me boobies or boobs like so i can i'm like oh yeah that's boobies like you guys every time i can now instantly spot boobies right away if i It's not gonna work.

3256
04:16:30,340 --> 04:16:31,440
What do you mean?

3257
04:16:31,740 --> 04:16:33,360
It's not boobs.

3258
04:16:36,260 --> 04:16:39,480
One day, it's going to be.

3259
04:16:39,800 --> 04:16:49,820
Well, I hope you guys become a successful game developer and sneak that one in for whatever AAA or successful indie game is going to be.

3260
04:16:50,180 --> 04:16:51,060
That's your goal.

3261
04:16:51,320 --> 04:16:56,520
To make a password where it'll actually be boobies for once or boobs.

3262
04:16:58,040 --> 04:17:03,040
good luck dragons good luck i will

3263

anyway guys i'm gonna call here oh my gosh i think oh man i thought like it'd be a short stream because i only had like three episodes but um we i think i think it was because of the coop mission oh my god the coop mission was actually fucking terrible but I'm gonna call it here everyone I hope you had a great time hanging out with me as always um I always have a fun time with everyone here and that you enjoyed my playthrough of dispatch I did enjoy going through this game it was very interesting the story was very interesting um there's a lot of fun choices and everything and you know this I think that the gameplay of being like a dispatcher is such a you know it's a unique concept that I enjoy very much Um,

3264
04:17:53,800 --> 04:17:57,720
because, you know, um, we gotta figure out, you know, okay, not the RNG part.

3265
04:17:57,880 --> 04:17:59,840
Some of the RNG was so fucked.

3266
04:18:00,280 --> 04:18:06,880
I, the RNG was definitely really fucked, but, like, I still had a great time.

3267
04:18:07,200 --> 04:18:09,460
Um, Patroesit, thank you, thank you, thank you.

3268
04:18:09,560 --> 04:18:15,680
Mark my words, if our next doki fanging ships sometime this century, boobies will be a password to unlock things early.

3269
04:18:16,000 --> 04:18:18,220
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3270
04:18:18,520 --> 04:18:20,800

And, you guys, I'll see you guys next.

3274

Oh, yeah, by the way, I can't believe it.

3275
04:19:04,800 --> 04:19:08,460
I just realized only 30% of the city survived, but I still pass.

3276
04:19:08,540 --> 04:19:09,120
That's crazy.

3277
04:19:09,520 --> 04:19:12,200
Like, that's crazy.

3278
04:19:12,980 --> 04:19:16,120
Like, 70% of LA is literally gone.

3279
04:19:16,440 --> 04:19:17,900
And I'm like, we did it, guys.
