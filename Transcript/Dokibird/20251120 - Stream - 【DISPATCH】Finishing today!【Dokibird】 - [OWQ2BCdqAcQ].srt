00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,710
Charlie, dad bit my finger, Charlie bit my finger.

I can't believe that was a fucking meme.

21
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,750
But we're we as a society.

28
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:32,170
birthday also um i know like i know i'm like you guys are
like please stop talking about my revivals but my revivals

29
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:44,050
update um i talked to the organizers um and uh they might i
don't know if they will but like i might have to off-roll so

30
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:50,610
like i don't know if they are gonna do it but uh um because
like we were i was like giving suggestions on how we can

31
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:57,850
make it more fun and let's like try hard i was like oh you
could put all the eternity plus players on off-roll i'm not

32
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:13,410
playing take i swear i would fucking play would i don't care
um if we have four dps i'm playing dps um so so um um and i

33
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:22,650
said like oh i don't think it'd be we don't know what's
gonna happen like because um i i said like um oh like an

34
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:30,790
eternity player has so much more game sense map knowledge
and skill wise over a celestial player I don't know you guys

35
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:34,190
understand the gap between Celestial and Eternity.

36
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:41,330
It's actually like, no, like whenever a Celestial player
gets accidentally gets into an Eternity lobby, like they get

37
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:41,970
yelled at.

38
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:50,630
Like you could tell that they do not belong in that lobby
because like the knowledge between a Celestial player and

39
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:54,990
Eternity player is such a huge gap that like every, I know
because I play Ranks.

40
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:59,410
So every time a Celestial player sneaks into an Eternity
lobby, they always get yelled at.

41
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:11,770
try to pick dps they're like no get on support like they're
like no get on support you do not touch dps or like get off

42
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:22,630
of tick no so so because they're asking me like do you think
celestial players should also be on their off roles and i

43
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:32,430
was like i i said personally i don't know um because uh um
because like i don't know i don't know these players but i

44
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:39,150
do know that a celestial 3 player versus a celestial 1
player is also a huge gap between knowledge because you know

45
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:45,530
celestial 1 is closer to eternity versus celestial 3 who's
closer to grandmaster um especially if that's their peak if

46
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:51,590
they piece celestial 3 then like i know you've never like
hit that elo where you could play with the eternity players

47
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:58,150
or like you know sometimes you do but you know you don't
play often with eternity players so um so like you know i'm

48
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:02,890
trying to help them figure out you know as someone that
organized tournaments before i'm trying to help them

49
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:08,910
especially like for hero shooters because i think hero
shooters is the hardest thing to um is the hardest thing to

50
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:15,170
figure out in terms of like how do you balance a hero
shooter when all roles are different because it's like 70

51
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:25,530
support players in this tournament um so so how do you
balance a tournament when percent of the people you have in

52
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:32,890
this tournament are essentially support players and we have
two tier tank players there's only two tank players like

53
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:39,790
they can other support players can off-roll as tank players
but like it's still an off-roll so it's like more so of like

54
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:48,290
um how how do you how do you balance a tournament when it's
70 support players one percent tank players and the rest its

55
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:48,790
DPS.

56
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:55,250
So it's very, um, like there are, no, they have like, you
know, like second role, like, you know, like, what is your

57
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,650
main role and what is your second role?

58
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:01,970
Obviously your second role will never be as good as your
first role because when you're playing your second role,

59
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,890
you're essentially flexing, you know?

60
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:11,570
Um, so they're asking me about that.

61
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:14,170
And I said, I told them personally, I don't know.

62
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:21,890
I think for sure, um, to make it more fun, each tournament
player should off-roll and I said I don't you know how it's

63
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:32,370
like I hope I don't off-roll but if I have to to make this
tournament more fun for everyone I will even though like I

64
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:40,770
would love to play support um but I you know I understand
that like you know I will take it for the team and I'll

65
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:51,190
off-roll just so everyone can have a more fun time because
there's no reason why they them yesterday i did my placement

66
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:57,490
matches i did all 10 of my placements matches and um because
i was like i got it you know i have the practice for the

67
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:08,030
tournament um because everyone was like oh it's for fun the
prize money is 7.5k for first place um and um um anyway so i

68
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:15,270
obviously i didn't try out the new season yet and i was like
oh okay i should really see what the new meta is and like

69
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:24,290
see how to play in this new elo and also try out Gambit
because in my head I was like um in my head I was like the

70
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:31,070
only way I can carry my team as a support play is I have to
play Gambit because Gambit a lot of people are like Gambit

71
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:41,470
is the cure coat no Gambit is the honor of of Marvel rivals
um because you don't use your cleanse the only thing you do

72
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:49,370
on Gambit this is what I've learned um how to play gambit
like you know and then like all them like you have to play

73
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:56,950
like saipe who is currently who is like rank one support in
the world and saipe got rank one on gambit and basically

74
00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:04,870
everyone was like um you barely use your cleanse because
what you do is you have to use your anti-heal every like all

75
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:13,470
the time it's all about anti-heal so he is basically the
honor of Marvel rivals because you're just and like and then

76
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:25,870
my friends they're like um no DPS can 1v1 a gambit anymore
because his util is so good anti-heal means when you use it

77
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:32,630
when he use it and it's like a it's like a hit scan
anti-heal too it's not even projectile the anti-heal is so

78
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:43,370
broken it does damage and it does anti and you have two so I
could technically spam two and then the supports so um so

79
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:53,030
he's so fucking strong and his dash and his dash is so good
too so i um so i did all my placement matches and um yeah he

80
00:14:53,030 --> 00:15:01,210
can heal while using his mobility too so gambit is very
fucking strong right now and it's like my friends were like

81
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:11,870
who are pros are like no tps player can confidently 1v1 um
gambit and gambit anymore because he's that oh like that

82
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:21,010
good of a support and then he was like uh he's like
basically he can kill all the other supports um even if like

83
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:29,330
if he has like a if he he could pick off any support player
on the enemy team with his anti-heal and his like left click

84
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:35,890
and so so i was like that can't be true there's no way

85
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:45,510
I was like, there's no way he's that good.

86
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,250
Like, there's, like, oh my gosh.

87
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,010
Like, you know, I was like in denial.

88
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:56,770
So then I was like, I'm going to go, you know, I'm going to
go do my placement matches and then see how it's going to be

89
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:57,150
like.

90
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:02,710
And so this is like, I think this is my second placement
match.

91
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:16,870
And I need you guys to know, this was in a lobby of GM1s and
celestial players and top 500 is celestial 2 right now and

92
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:28,310
look at this look at this stat line very carefully

93
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:51,450
oh and also look at my finalist I was it was basically a 1v1
I literally you win if I went with winning 1v1s against

94
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:54,180
spider-man and iron fist and

95
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:06,330
And I've only had One loss on gambit But and whenever I got
to play gambit.

96
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:23,690
I've only had on Gambit when I had to and I played six games
on him and so um yeah so he's like he's very strong but

97
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:32,250
Gambit is the only character I believe and Mantis is Gambit
and Mantis that you can use to no they had a Gambit but he

98
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:41,510
swapped off because he was shit like the enemy team had a
Gambit but they swapped off because obviously he wasn't

99
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:56,090
doing as good as the other gambit so it's not like so if i
could do that in a high elo lobby imagine what i could do in

100
00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:04,490
like the vtuber tournament as gambit because like he is the
only character i believe that can that can confidently i can

101
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:12,630
say can actually one v for a team if i just take off angles
and we play triple support so i was telling them i was just

102
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:18,670
like oh um i feel like you know if i was on gap like maybe
they'll just ban gambit but i was just like if i was on get

103
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:32,350
gambit this is not gonna be fun also luna is hard not meta
luna is trash right now um and then um i i am confident

104
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:42,590
because me on gambit i can like I can bully the lower ELO
supports easily or the lower ELO DPS players because I was

105
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:55,490
already bullying the DPS players that were in my ELO that's
the thing I was already bullying the support and DPS players

106
00:18:55,490 --> 00:19:14,270
in my ELO so yeah like if I had to go against people who are
lower ELO than me would not be fun for them so so um so they

107
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:20,670
were like yeah we might we will need you to off off roll and
i was like i'm fine with that like i was even saying like i

108
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:34,310
don't think it's fair you put me on gambit uh i was just
like um i was just like oh i i also i like i even i was like

109
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:42,190
i don't think it's fair if you put me in Gambit like because
like Gambit is like a DPS now and if I run triple support my

110
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:48,470
two supports can just pocket the rest of the team and I can
just take off angle and play like a triple like a second DPS

111
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:55,650
or a third DPS like um like I could literally just play as a
second DPS and like his util is so fucking broken it is

112
00:19:55,650 --> 00:20:05,670
basically a self-healing DPS um so he is a self-healing dps
which is already pretty scary with anti-heal

113
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:17,470
so so i was like i just feel i feel like i like if at that
point everyone in eternity plus maybe we need to off roll i

114
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:23,570
know i'm like you know maybe like i get shit on as gambit um
leon if i can play game i just don't i don't i'm just like

115
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:31,670
thinking like i don't think it's fun if i'm just like
playing gambit and all i do is just like like use all my

116
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:38,710
util to kill their supports because like that's what i was
literally doing like here in this game so i had literally i

117
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:48,050
only lost one game on gambit there all the times i got to
play him and um and so like there is potentially a chance

118
00:20:48,050 --> 00:21:00,570
that um i'm gonna have to off-roll um just to make it fair
for everyone in the tournament and uh um um what if the top

119
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:03,730
five on gps offer was to then I'm gonna ban Gambit.

120
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,310
I have first ban.

121
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:09,910
We all, if we all have first ban, I'll just ban Gambit.

122
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,730
I'm not fucking giving them Gambit.

123
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:22,370
but if everyone knows that I'm gonna play Gambit, then
Gambit's just gonna be permaband for me as well.

124
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:25,710
And then, like, and then, like, what the fuck do I do?

125
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:28,730
Like, I can't hard carry as anything else but Mantis.

126
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:35,870
Like, and even then, my Mantis is not that good compared to
like because i still like i hate aiming with mantis i don't

127
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:45,810
know how to fully aim with mantis because um because like
he's uh he's like hard to penny is so strong but not really

128
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:54,070
um there's only penny players that play penny she's still
not that she's still not the strongest tanks in rivals um so

129
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:59,030
all right like i know i'm like off topic but i have to talk
also they were like if we off-roll, will you be captain

130
00:21:59,030 --> 00:21:59,430
again?

131
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,970
And I didn't respond back.

132
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:12,820
They want to give me the captain title because I guess it
looks better if like, you know, Team Doki Bird, because they

133
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:17,760
want like, because like, the thing is, the captains, um,
they're not all the high-rank players.

134
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:23,140
It's the player, it's like basically the most well-known
VTubers are captains.

135
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:31,520
So, so like, you know, like whoever is like, more, like, you
know, the most well-known to so they they want us to like be

136
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:38,540
the face of the team like you know be the face so like you
know oh look it's this team this team this team and yeah

137
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:47,680
it's for the publicity so they're like they're like would
you be captain get we implement the off-roll thing and i'm

138
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:56,520
just like oh my gosh i really don't want to be captain i i'm
okay with being captain if i get to pick my team but like I

139
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,420
just feel weird about being captain.

140
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,700
No, it's pre-assigned.

141
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,160
The entire, all the teams are pre-assigned as well.

142
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,180
And apparently, I don't know if this is true.

143
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,020
I don't know.

144
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,560
I got a little confused.

145
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:19,860
But it was supposed to be like, oh, it's supposed to be an
all NA tournament.

146
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,120
And then apparently, but it wasn't that clear.

147
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,980
So some EU players sneaked in.

148
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,400
So then they were like, oh, sorry, we have to find any
players to replace you guys because you're not supposed to

149
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,680
be in this tournament.

150
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,260
Any only.

151
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:47,520
So like, they can't announce anything yet because they have
to, they have to find like any replacements.

152
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,320
I didn't realize it was, I think it was in the rules.

153
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:58,100
Oh yeah, I think it was, it was in the rules that it was
supposed, in the forum it was supposed to be na but like um

154
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:05,420
they didn't fully check the i guess like they didn't fully
check it um but so that's why like nothing is real it's

155
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:12,840
region lock nothing is fully yeah it wasn't said it was said
in the forum that it was na only but some eu players applied

156
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:22,040
for it so they have to like be like sorry guys it sucks it
sucks but um you know um if it's it i think it has to do

157
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:29,980
with like uh prizes as well because i know like some um
prizes like you know like transferring prize money and

158
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:36,800
everything um it has to like regarding like guidelines on
how to transfer prize money especially for taxes and

159
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:44,680
everything it makes sense to keep it within na because it
gets more complicated if you're outside of na and you have

160
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:53,280
like you have to fill in like special tax forms and stuff to
receive prize money and everything So, like, so like,

161
00:24:53,680 --> 00:25:00,060
because of that, that's why I'm not surprised it's NA locked
because you don't want to deal with the headaches of, like,

162
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:06,640
the headache of trying to figure out tax money, like how to,
you know, fill out the tax forms for the prize money in

163
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,000
itself.

164
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:10,100
So, yeah, so I don't know when teams would be announced.

165
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,840
I don't know if the special rules are going to be
implemented.

166
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:21,380
I did say maybe test out the off-roll rule just in case,
like do like a practice match to see if teams are going to

167
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:21,380
be able to.

168
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:29,040
are not balanced or not because I don't know like it's so I
was looking at the forum and even I was like how do you

169
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:37,360
balance this like I'm so glad I don't have to handle the
balancing for this because looking at that forum I was just

170
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:44,160
like oh my god how do you balance this because like you guys
might be thinking like oh why don't you just find players

171
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:53,380
for all roles the thing is um to run a tournament you also
have to find people that have the viewership as well to prop

172
00:25:53,380 --> 00:26:02,420
up the numbers because you know all rivals all rivals one is
to make sure that um their game is advertised to as many

173
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:12,700
people as possible so um so because of that like they want
to make it balanced to a point where like you know the

174
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:19,120
bigger streamers there's also enough balance of the bigger
streamers but you know, maybe all the bigger streamers play

175
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,700
support.

176
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,400
You know?

177
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:31,360
Like all the streamers, majority of the streamers that have
the numbers and the skill level, in the different skill

178
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,980
level, are support players.

179
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:37,340
So, you know, that's what can you do?

180
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,660
So that's what a tournament has, a lot of support players.

181
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:50,440
And it's, I, you know, I don't even know how, the fuck they
balance this it's so hard and I was literally looking at you

182
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:58,760
asking my opinion being like being like what do you do you
think do you think we should give Celestia off roll and I

183
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:07,640
was like I don't fucking know I know you turn any plus shit
off roll I know I don't know for sure you turn any plus shit

184
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,920
off roll because I was yeah it's so strong

185
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:28,580
um so yeah anyway ow i clapped and then hit the hit the bite
wound um anyway so that is the marvel rivals update for

186
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:36,480
today um oh yeah one more thing um i bump i when i was
playing off stream i bump you know i was bumping to other

187
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:45,480
like streamers and pro players and one streamer slash pro
was like oh dokeybird um hey dokeybird um why aren't you

188
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:53,360
streaming um like they typed in the chat in the match chat
while we were in game and then i replied back he was on the

189
00:27:53,360 --> 00:28:06,580
enemy team i replied back i don't know why wasn't i
nominated i know that's so fucking petty but i was like bro

190
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:16,100
it's off stream like it's off stream at two in the morning i
can see where the fuck i want i'm so salty

191
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:29,560
it's so petty i know that's it's so petty i know that's like
bro i'm fucking gonna play like bro i have nothing no

192
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:40,900
there's no whatsoever i i gain nothing anymore and then
they're just like and then they were like oh dot dot dot

193
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,320
I'm valid as fuck

194
00:28:54,680 --> 00:29:01,860
But like I have nothing to Yeah, there's nothing to lose But
anyway, I just didn't want to style it I was trying to

195
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,860
practice for I was just wanting to do my place in matches

196
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:15,580
And oh yeah And I placed Celestial 3 For those who are
wondering Top 500 is Celestial 2, and I play Celestial 3.

197
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,380
Thanks, Gambit.

198
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,640
Shout out to you, Gambit.

199
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:25,500
And for those who are wondering, like, wait, if Gambit's so
strong, why isn't he bad?

200
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:28,540
Because other characters are also very strong and scary.

201
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:39,060
Daredevil is so strong, and the must-bans, what I've
learned, is Daredevil, Scythe, Emma, Hela.

202
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:42,020
These are, like, the four top bands.

203
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:51,120
at the moment so like um so these are the four that everyone
sort of always bans which i've noticed is daredevil sidlock

204
00:29:51,120 --> 00:30:00,300
emma hella because they're so scary there there's too many
strong heroes because gambit um key um the thing is to play

205
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:06,900
gambit well is that you have to have the other support also
doing a lot of healing so the gambit has to rely on the

206
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,880
other support to be able to do

207
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:17,300
a gambit yeah it's a gamble to play gambit because there's
also a lot of shitty gambit players

208
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:29,120
gambit um gambit there's a lot of very shitty gambit players
and they all a lot of people think you have to be a heel

209
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:38,740
like think that like um oh it's do you dps on gambit or you
be a heel bot no you have to balance between the two you

210
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:46,360
have to balance between the two but You use your ability,
your card ability to do anti-heal.

211
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,680
That's literally it.

212
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,580
You barely use it for anything else.

213
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,260
Like, you don't really use it for healing.

214
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,260
You don't use it for cleanse.

215
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,240
You just use it for mostly anti-heal.

216
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,860
Cleanse is mostly for Bucky alt or Groot alt.

217
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,540
That's it.

218
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,980
But everything else is like, you know, you use it for anti.

219
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,040
Anyway, let's play Dispatch.

220
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:02,720
I don't know if...

221
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,780
Okay, I forgot to ask.

222
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,200
Alright.

Sorry, Soundgap.

225
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,980

thank you thank you um also people got really mad that i was

231
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:14,960
robbing mistakes we can't all always have good endings guys
this year might be like a very unlucky year for me this year

232
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:26,980
like and i'm gonna reflect that in my dispatch playthrough
um we all have to live with our consequences like not every

233
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:37,760
ending is a good ending why do you think we have criminals
do you think they're happy to be in prison like look look i

234
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:46,320
am running the i don't care if i'm heading towards a bad
ending sometimes life is like that sometimes you just live

235
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:51,000
the life where you have bad things happen to you and i'm

Thank you.

240
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,080
Thank you.

241
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,920
Happy birthday to you.

242
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,800
Happy birthday to you.

243
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,820
Happy birthday, dear FTP.

244
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,900
Happy birthday to you.

245
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:13,380
Yay!

246
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,800
Happy birthday!

247
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:16,840
Alright.

248
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:17,720
Let's go.

249
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,500
It's Robert time.

250
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,880
It's time to be Robert for another day.

251
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:29,250
If I wanted to bat, I'd just stop playing game and live my
life.

252
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:35,610
The thing is, I don't know what my choice are gonna make me,
so I gotta live with my consequences.

253
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:38,230
If I make a bad choice, fuck me.

254
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:40,130
There's no going back.

255
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,040
I don't purposely play knowing where my choices end up to.

256
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,960
I pick choices that I think is pretty funny.

257
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:58,920
Because I'm not gonna make these choices and these bad
choices in real life.

258
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,220
I believe you have to hang out with those fuckers.

259
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,340
You jealous, old man?

260
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:02,980
Of what?

261
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:03,680
Let me guess.

262
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,860
You get into a bar fight I'm right, right.

263
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,120
That's what criminals do it for.

264
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:07,820
They ruin everything.

265
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,960
If you're going to make me stand next to a criminal, you
could at least hurry these shit up.

266
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,760
Bro, you missed the 3 a.m.

267
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:15,340
tacos.

268
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,780
You're sick as hell.

269
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,920
I only want to hear this full of shit.

270
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,080
Well, what you missed was 3 a.m.

271
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:20,320
talk.

272
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,500
And despite all of that, it's nice.

273
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,800
I guess that was.

274
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,880
Sounds like my local taco bell.

275
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:34,480
We good when you're good, Mecha, man.

276
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,580
Engaging protocols.

277
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,600
Game audio can be raised.

278
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,060
Okay.

279
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,100
Sound guy, what do you think?

280
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,440
It's fine.

281
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,860
I'll just, I'll raise it just in case.

282
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:46,860
All right.

283
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,280
I raised it a little bit.

284
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:49,340
Now.

285
00:34:58,610 --> 00:34:59,870
All reading super stable.

286
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:02,730
Here we go.

287
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:03,130
Oh.

288
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:04,930
I got a flex.

289
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:07,270
Wait, no superhero pose.

290
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:09,070
All right.

291
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,470
Ready for launch.

292
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:11,550
Roger that.

293
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:14,070
Gotta be a superhero.

294
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:15,970
Even though I'm retired.

295
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:18,710
My cold microwave.

296
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:20,030
wave steak now.

297
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:23,410
Oh, my girlfriend here is to support me.

298
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:27,470
Did I do it?

299
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:32,390
That's the superhero pose, not the landing one.

300
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:34,370
Bro, the landing one would have been cooler.

301
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,730
Bro, you know, like, the Spider-Man one?

302
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:44,950
Or, like, the Superman pose?

303
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:49,350
I thought the same, too, but I think the purple is a nice
touch.

304
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:50,830
What?

305
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:52,410
What?

306
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,850
Oh, that's not supposed to happen?

307
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:00,410
Yeah, I was like, where did the purple smoke come from, bro?

308
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,480
Oh, Ben, that's my future boyfriend.

309
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:18,260
Don't worry, I know I have two more episodes, so I can't be
dying.

310
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,860
I'm not... I know he's gonna live, because there's still
episodes.

311
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,360
Episode 7 and 8.

312
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,120
Oh, shit!

313
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,960
Don't worry, I live this, right?

314
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,220
I'm just gonna be in the hospital.

315
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:46,220
The last two episodes are just a blank screen.

316
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,360
I'm like, in...

317
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,560
The last two episodes is me in purgatory.

318
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,760
Yeah, see, I knew I was alive.

319
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:07,360
Oh, look, there's my badass dog.

320
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,520
I love you.

321
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,760
Wait, he got more injured than me?

322
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,020
How long was I out?

323
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,000
About 14, 15 hours, I think.

324
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:24,980
Bro, he broke his arm and has a concussion, and I just have,
like...

325
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,000
You look worse than me.

326
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:26,400
Yeah.

327
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,460
It's over, brother.

328
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:33,520
I cannot recreate the Astral Pulse.

329
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:35,480
What?

330
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,260
Too much power.

331
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,980
Too small a size.

332
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,380
We'll just make it bigger.

333
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,900
Horse mean I can't make the man Mecca.

334
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,340
I'm not good enough, bro.

335
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,100
No.

336
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,300
No, don't say that.

337
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,660
I must bring down the whole team.

338
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,480
I believe in you.

339
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,340
Let's get everybody blowed up.

340
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,280
Hey, listen.

341
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,420
Bro, I believe.

342
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,060
As long as I believe in you, you can do anything.

343
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,080
It's not a literal league game, brother.

344
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,400
This real life.

345
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,420
No.

346
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:09,640
Right.

347
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,620
Oh, I should have been like just a minor setback.

348
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,040
You did your best.

349
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,180
I can't ask for anything else.

350
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,240
Thank you.

351
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,980
Come on, give me that.

352
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,520
Yeah, fisted.

353
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,280
I heard that big bastard crying in the bathroom.

354
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,100
Makes it hard to shit when someone's doing that next to you,
you know?

355
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,540
Pretty distracting.

356
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:39,180
Yeah.

357
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:40,180
No.

358
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,900
Everyone else okay?

359
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,360
And Vizigo?

360
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:44,300
Fine.

361
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,000
One thing she's good at is discipline.

362
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:54,180
appearing when people get hurt what's your deal with her you
give everyone shit but it always seems extra with vizzy

363
00:38:54,180 --> 00:39:01,880
she's a liability and one of us needs to be objective when
it's clear something's going on between the two of you don't

364
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:11,380

Oh, we can bring it a little more?

371
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,480
Okay, let me double check the audio.

372
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,340
Real quick, sound.

373
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:56,920
Yeah, we're already up the sound a lot, so we'll just up it
a little more here.

374
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,220
Alright, up it a little more.

375
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,180
I want to take the day off.

376
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:01,980
No, really.

377
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:02,600
Bro.

378
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,700
I'm fine.

379
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:04,840
She's gonna fuck me up, bro?

380
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,660
Just throw...

381
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,580
Say no more.

382
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,780
Man, you and the infirmary.

383
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:09,480
Think about that.

384
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,820
I'll mull it over.

385
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:20,270
It's like he's trying to warn me about her and I'm like, yo,
you think she likes me?

386
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:24,370
He's like, bro, there's so many red flags.

387
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:26,830
And I'm like, did she actually likes me?

388
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:27,370
More enhanced.

389
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:28,590
Proceed with caution.

390
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,410
One sec.

391
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:32,070
What are you doing up?

392
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:34,790
Turns out, I'm completely fine.

You don't understand.

411
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:27,890
A cat needs three people to entertain.

412
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:30,730
Oh, my God.

413
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:31,550

mobility?

424
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:15,890
Surely that helps out, right?

425
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:18,250
Oh, cyberbullying.

426
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:19,830
My asshole keeps hacking to my notes app.

427
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:22,290
He's fucking with all my stand-up comedy material.

428
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:25,050
Also, I think they have access to our secure servers.

429
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:26,770
All right, so we gotta do...

430
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:27,090
Oh, it's...

431
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:27,590
Oh, my God.

432
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:28,150
It's a medium.

433
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:29,010
Do you think I'm ready?

00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:34,250
Oh, my God.

437
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:35,550
That's a huge responsibility.

00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:45,130

interesting.

Yeah, what?

533
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,180

how did they roleplay as the hero that was foretold okay so

540
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:45,500
it's just roleplay stands for live action roleplay but it's
not a sex thing i mean it can be dressing up and playing

541
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:57,700
pretend type shit still sounds like a sex thing it can be
you heard about those conventions all right everyone oh this

No fucking way.

593
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:57,220
He wants them destroyed, but I think there's a way to
reprogram them.

594
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:01,660
Patch up to the retreating, then reprogram them to not
attack humans.

595
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:04,500
Well, oh my gosh, we need someone smart, but we don't have
that.

Why?

602
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,340
There's some activity down in the sewers.

603
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:15,960
My tenants are getting uneasy.

604
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,400

00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:55,840
He ain't coming back in time.

622
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:57,140
I have to...

623
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:58,660
It should be fine.

624
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:02,860
Okay, we have to keep the... Oh my god.

625
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:05,100
Oh my god.

626
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:08,120
Your team would fail.

627
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,100
Would anyone not fail?

628
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:12,920
One, two, three.

629
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,660
Who do I hit all the guys?

630
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:16,700
Why did I invest in all the combat?

631
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:17,460
What?

632
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,820
I mean, I can't even do this.

633
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:24,300
All right, some people are going to die today.

634
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:34,100
Yes, some people are going to.

635
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:34,920
All right.

636
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,680
Sometimes things happen.

637
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,660
Sometimes things happen.

638
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:41,900
I got it.

639
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:42,920
All right.

640
00:57:43,440 --> 00:58:00,160
We have to accept that We can't save everyone I know I stole
a few tragic Maybe violence wasn't the answer I can't

641
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:10,800
believe violence was not the answer I'm gonna send his or
her ex-boyfriend to this hero training All right Investigate

645
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:44,260

646
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:46,920
Like, you don't get to do that with Waterboy.

647
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:49,280
Alright, let's see.

648
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:54,120
Okay, what I've learned is that we have to stop putting it
on combat.

649
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:57,640
What?

650
00:58:58,260 --> 00:58:59,220
Oh, hey, look.

651
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:03,560
This is what I learned today.

652
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:05,580
Oh, is he already maxed out?

653
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:07,760
Unlucky.

654
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:09,360
Are you fucking kidding me?

655
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:09,940
Are you?

656
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:10,520
No.

657
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:11,820
No, don't do this to me.

658
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:12,080
No.

659
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,020
Oh, thank God.

660
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,460
Oh, thank God we fucking made it.

661
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:18,900
See, you don't need fire.

662
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:22,380
All we get to do, we can just punch people.

663
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:23,720
That's fine.

664
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:24,740
All right.

665
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:27,460
We'll have him learn something.

666
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:29,420
We might as well.

667
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:31,260
We don't have anything else to do.

668
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:33,280
How are you depressed?

669
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,060
We got a job well done.

670
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,660
How is your depression?

671
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:38,500
Have you just not been...

672
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:42,060
Have you thought about not being sad?

673
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:55,420
I'm a bad person Just Alright Twice was set to max And
removes rest time after Stats dropped to one Wait that's

674
00:59:55,420 --> 01:00:03,860
good that means less combat And reduce call completion If
after it fails a third he is down Yeah that's fine There's

675
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:08,120
no way he's gonna fail again Easy don't be sad

676
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:15,880
Alright Everything is fine Oh, I didn't get the bonus.

677
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,260
Oh, I did get the bonus.

678
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:19,380
Yay.

679
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,460
I'm sure we don't work on commission.

680
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:23,560
We did it.

681
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,280
I said my chemistry, people.

682
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:28,840

Win them over with...

685

Diplomatic has to be with, like, your brain, right?

686
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:37,920
And I maxed that out.

687
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:42,700
Oh, thank God.

688
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:44,460
I was gonna say, thank God.

689
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,160

690
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:48,600

717
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:01,020
Wait, what the fuck?

718
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:04,180
Oh, hi.

719
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:06,240
What are you doing here?

720
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:06,780
I'm decent.

721
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:08,960
Definitely a house that needs some warmth.

722
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:09,420
Wait.

723
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:11,880
I'm in my underwear.

724
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:14,480
I am in my underwear.

725
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:15,700
What are you doing here?

726
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:16,820
I can see you.

727
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:18,700
I was joking when I asked if you're decent.

728
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:19,680
I know.

729
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:23,380
I just need you to know that I know how I look right now.

730
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:23,780
All right.

731
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:24,820
That rubs out, by the way.

732
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,840
You just have to put a little muscle into it.

733
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:28,640
Do you know the way you want to hang this?

734
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:30,720
You could have just knocked on my door.

735
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:32,680
I think he's only considered where he'd hang himself.

736
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:34,180
That corner seems fine.

737
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,120
Whoa, what the fuck?

738
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:37,980
It's a housewarming gift for your housewarming party,
brother.

739
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,100
I told people to bring a lamp or something.

740
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:40,540
Wait, wait.

741
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:41,120
People.

742
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:44,420
This is gonna be a party now?

743
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:45,920
Look, I'm not really...

744
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:46,440
My home's depressing.

745
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:49,840
Not what it looks like to me, but you're tidy whities.

746
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:50,540
Oh!

747
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:53,160
This is your family photo area?

748
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:54,760
Kind of morbid.

749
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:57,000
Which I'm kind of...

750
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,760
At least I had a family.

751
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:00,520
I'll go this too far.

752
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:02,500
We figured it out, brother.

753
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:05,140
The man can be Mecca again.

754
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:05,620
Oh?

755
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:10,960
After your little premature Jack explosion, I had this
feeling like I'd seen it before.

756
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:12,480
Then Vizzi asked me to get the...

757
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:18,480
energy reading we got this morning and cross-reference with
recent calls wait wait wait wait it's not destroyed wait

is why we're having a party the society know every low-level

762
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:50,780
super villain in three counties that's true we track its
location they'll know who has it then we kick in some doors

763
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:59,520

no time regardless of how this plays out yeah i feel like it

764

767
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:18,440

01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:25,860
Skylaw, Arcadia runs it now.

772
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,140
Three generations that family's been trying to think of me.

773
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:28,580
Huh?

774
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:29,740

775
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:31,000
You're cute.

776
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:34,640
We're gonna ask you some questions about a piece of peck

777
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:37,040

789
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:52,400
I make the choices for him.

790
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:55,080
Lamps for everyone.

But don't share it with your dad.

1112

But didn't my dad do it for free?

1113

01:29:59,770 --> 01:30:01,310
He was like a big brother to me.

1133
01:30:02,530 --> 01:30:03,850
I didn't appreciate it enough.

1134
01:30:05,230 --> 01:30:05,730
I'm sorry.

1135
01:30:06,530 --> 01:30:09,910
Chase had only babysit nights when dad had to deal with
something big.

1136
01:30:11,050 --> 01:30:13,230
Working late, he called him.

1137
01:30:14,410 --> 01:30:21,010
I was fine being alone, but I'd still ask to have him wash
me because I could guilt trip him into buying me shut.

1138
01:30:21,330 --> 01:30:24,230
Duke, thank you, Mr. Richel, thank you, thank you, and happy
birthday.

1139
01:30:25,390 --> 01:30:32,770
We'll sing you a happy birthday soon, Duke, after, you know,
the guy, after, like, the dying guy is gone.

1140
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:36,810
So maybe one less door run for bitch-ass Robert, and he
wouldn't be stuck in here.

1141
01:30:38,250 --> 01:30:39,550
That's what you're saying, right?

1142
01:30:39,890 --> 01:30:44,790
I mean, it was, but now that you put it like that.

1143
01:30:46,670 --> 01:30:57,030
Hey, the only person that put Chase here, investigation
invisible suspended obviously but i think you should

1144
01:30:57,030 --> 01:31:06,110
consider cutting her from the team no i'm not saying you
should i'm just saying you should consider it might make

1145
01:31:06,110 --> 01:31:13,350
things worse it's a hundred percent i'm keeping her i'm
using all my power to keep her in that might just make

1146
01:31:13,350 --> 01:31:22,670
things worse no that's my girlfriend it's just i can't help
but think that we've already cut a hero for far less yeah

1147
01:31:22,670 --> 01:31:41,200
but she didn't want to fuck me that's different yay nepotism
just gets better and better vending machine the true

1148
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:51,380
whatever i want yeah see if i hooked up with the boss she
would have given me a hundred dollar allowance he told me

1149
01:31:51,380 --> 01:31:53,500
that Really?

1150
01:31:53,960 --> 01:31:54,760
He's proud of me?

1151
01:31:59,530 --> 01:32:01,750
Instead of just $5, I could have got $100.

1152
01:32:06,250 --> 01:32:07,890
Oh, I'm sorry, Chase.

1153
01:32:08,390 --> 01:32:09,030
Robert.

1154
01:32:10,370 --> 01:32:11,290
Twinkie money.

1155
01:32:14,170 --> 01:32:16,350
It's not about the money, Thurkey.

1156
01:32:16,510 --> 01:32:18,410
It's about power and promotion.

1157
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:26,800
Oh.

1158
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:28,960
Got Twinkie, though.

1159
01:32:32,470 --> 01:32:46,490
oh she gave me a shitty dot five dollar not even flat she
made me crumpled up my five dollars water boy i just

1160
01:32:46,490 --> 01:32:58,070
realized it's what's his name the youtube the guy who does
like um those types of animations where i'm just where you

1161
01:32:58,070 --> 01:33:02,510
like trace over do we where you use like live action footage
yeah Joel Haver.

1162
01:33:02,970 --> 01:33:03,390
I love that guy.

1163
01:33:03,390 --> 01:33:04,450
I love his animation.

1164
01:33:04,750 --> 01:33:08,370
He was also in Smiling Friends, but the fuck you save him.

1165
01:33:09,230 --> 01:33:13,290
But like he, his animations on YouTube is so good.

1166
01:33:13,370 --> 01:33:14,310
Yeah, rotoscoping.

1167
01:33:14,870 --> 01:33:15,550
He used roto.

1168
01:33:15,550 --> 01:33:17,950
He used like, not specific.

1169
01:33:18,110 --> 01:33:25,850
Yeah, he used like rotoscoping animation mixed with like,
what was it like, the new AI feature in the Photoshop?

1170
01:33:26,450 --> 01:33:27,650
I'm a little mad too.

1171
01:33:34,910 --> 01:33:50,910
fair and visigal was the one who and then chase shouldn't
have oh do you think he did the right thing i mean i don't

1172
01:33:50,910 --> 01:33:59,810
it seems very not clear or unclear i think he did i think
chase knew he was the only one who could save her and he

1173
01:33:59,810 --> 01:34:09,350
knew the risk so yeah i think it was ultimately the right
thing he died for a villain so that means she's redeemable

1174
01:34:12,090 --> 01:34:17,690
yeah twinkie oh case in point whoa

1175
01:34:22,530 --> 01:34:37,190
feel better kind of i'll clean it up what the fuck like that
did she have a crush on chase or something like what kind of

1176
01:34:37,190 --> 01:34:50,130
reaction was that hey hey water boy is the leaper build
version of what happened uh let's get to it main takeaways

1177
01:34:50,130 --> 01:34:59,890
are that invisigal has been suspended so we're a person down
the shift and that chase is in the infirmary and he's in

1178
01:34:59,890 --> 01:35:00,590
pretty rough shape

1179
01:35:05,610 --> 01:35:15,510
no he's depressed again just don't tell him i told you that
oh i've found doing something good always helps when i'm

1180
01:35:15,510 --> 01:35:28,410
feeling bad we're fortunate to have that opportunity
something chase never took for granted so let's get to work

1181
01:35:28,410 --> 01:35:33,750
my gosh there's like no off days here i guess you don't
really have an off day when you're you when everyone's

1182
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:40,910
always calling 9-1-1 I mean, what do you do when like you're
calling 9-1-1 and you're like, sorry, we're on a holiday?

1183
01:35:41,250 --> 01:35:42,870
Like, what the fuck do you do?

1184

bring him closer.

1298
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:31,260

1299

biblical down here take down the bug controlling save the

1300
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:39,260
farmer from being attacked.

1301
01:41:40,420 --> 01:41:41,340
Let me do this.

1302
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:42,960
I cannot do that.

1303
01:41:45,140 --> 01:41:47,200
Um, we'll just wait a little bit.

1304
01:41:47,580 --> 01:41:48,460
We'll just...

1305
01:41:48,460 --> 01:41:51,200
I realize I can't just do that.

1306
01:41:52,460 --> 01:41:55,600
Um, oh, oh, this is interesting.

1307
01:41:56,920 --> 01:42:00,800
Um, she's more intelligent.

1308
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:04,460
Uh, we'll do...

1309
01:42:05,180 --> 01:42:06,100
I don't know.

1310
01:42:06,180 --> 01:42:08,420
Do we need combat for this or...

1311
01:42:09,320 --> 01:42:10,420
No, Flambay.

1312
01:42:11,260 --> 01:42:12,700
No, Flambay is too strong.

1313
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:13,940
Oh, wait, no, he's fine.

1314
01:42:14,140 --> 01:42:16,940
This has to be...

1315
01:42:20,900 --> 01:42:21,960
Do we need...

1316
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:22,540
It's speed?

1317
01:42:22,640 --> 01:42:23,560
Okay, we'll do this.

1318
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:25,620
It's fine.

1319
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:25,940
See?

1320
01:42:26,900 --> 01:42:27,700
This is...

1321
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:29,780
This is 10, right?

1322
01:42:31,480 --> 01:42:32,440
Yeah, he's fine.

1323
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:32,840
There you go.

1324
01:42:32,840 --> 01:42:33,900
Flambay, go in there.

1325
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:34,880
Flang's a bitch.

1326
01:42:34,980 --> 01:42:35,640
You can't see shit.

1327
01:42:35,780 --> 01:42:36,420
That's gonna save...

1328
01:42:36,420 --> 01:42:37,500
Let me keep fly in the rain.

1329
01:42:37,900 --> 01:42:38,860
God damn, slip and slide.

1330
01:42:39,260 --> 01:42:40,500
I fucking love slipping.

1331
01:42:40,780 --> 01:42:41,180
Yay!

1332
01:42:41,380 --> 01:42:42,400
Golem's okay now.

1333
01:42:42,620 --> 01:42:44,140
And they're better friends.

1334
01:42:44,380 --> 01:42:45,060
I like it.

1335
01:42:45,340 --> 01:42:45,940
He's sober.

1336
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:47,820
That's how you fix sobriety.

1337
01:42:49,640 --> 01:42:50,820
We'll do mobility.

1338
01:42:51,160 --> 01:42:52,980
We'll make you fast as fuck, boy.

1339
01:42:55,700 --> 01:42:56,220
Wee!

1340
01:42:57,500 --> 01:42:58,780
Where he finishes.

1341
01:42:59,140 --> 01:43:01,060
He heals up so fast.

1342
01:43:02,140 --> 01:43:02,460
Alright.

1343
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:04,500
I don't know what the percentage is for this.

1344
01:43:07,680 --> 01:43:08,240
Yay!

1345
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:09,100
We did it!

1346
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:10,160
Nice.

1347
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:12,320
We've arrested a bug lady.

1348
01:43:12,620 --> 01:43:14,560
Is she, like, hot, though?

1349
01:43:14,720 --> 01:43:16,300
Like, the one-punched man, little lady?

1350
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:20,840
The Bone Zone pissed off the wrong gang, and they're holding
him hostage.

1351
01:43:21,060 --> 01:43:22,060
In the Bone Zone?

1352
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:24,940
Listen, I know he sucks, but he writes my checks.

1353
01:43:25,140 --> 01:43:26,680
Can you please just rescue him?

1354
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:27,300
There you go.

1355
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:29,200
We got you.

1356
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:33,140
Are they all really...

1357
01:43:33,140 --> 01:43:34,280
Are they... Okay, level two.

1358
01:43:35,480 --> 01:43:37,720
Okay, level two, and...

1359
01:43:37,720 --> 01:43:42,600
I'm gonna try raising up Prism and Flambé and Depression
Man.

1360
01:43:42,620 --> 01:43:44,360
and Jacksepticeye.

1361
01:43:45,820 --> 01:43:45,820
Hi.

1362
01:43:46,040 --> 01:43:51,000
Just going to confirm one of your Z-Team heroes for our
interview this afternoon to discuss the Phoenix program.

1363
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:51,780
Oh, okay.

1364
01:43:51,940 --> 01:43:52,820
Well, you're Sonar.

1365
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:54,680
He's gonna have public speaking.

1366
01:43:55,640 --> 01:43:56,200
What's this?

1367
01:43:57,520 --> 01:43:58,580
I'll bet Golem in there.

1368
01:43:58,600 --> 01:43:59,720
I really think it can help the team too.

1369
01:44:00,700 --> 01:44:01,580
Another one?

1370
01:44:02,440 --> 01:44:02,880
Terrence?

1371
01:44:03,540 --> 01:44:04,140

1372
01:44:04,240 --> 01:44:04,500

01:44:05,320 --> 01:44:05,760
Oh, shit.

1375
01:44:05,940 --> 01:44:06,360
We can't.

1376
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:09,580
Um, I gotta send Sonar in here first.

1377
01:44:10,860 --> 01:44:11,300

Yeah, we don't have anybody.

1403
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:22,620
Okay, we're gonna have to play it safe.

1404
01:46:23,020 --> 01:46:23,860
We need to play it safe.

1405
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:24,820

Okay, wait for her to return.

1413
01:46:32,140 --> 01:46:33,820
And then I know what to do.

1414
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:35,620
Alright, coffee time.

Vote depression, man!

1418
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:41,600
And then there's no way.

1419
01:46:41,640 --> 01:46:55,820
I swear to God, if we fuck up with I swear to God, if it's
intellect that we are missing, the one point of

1420
01:46:55,820 --> 01:47:00,160
intelligence, I swear to fucking God.

1421
01:47:02,420 --> 01:47:06,160
Like, there's no way I can fail this.

1422
01:47:06,820 --> 01:47:08,940
Oh, nice.

1423
01:47:09,100 --> 01:47:10,160
Oh, it was just me.

1424
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:13,640
Like, the one person.

1425
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:18,200
There we go.

1426
01:47:18,340 --> 01:47:20,240
If he dies, he'll be taken care of.

1427
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:22,800
Yeah, that's nice to know.

1428
01:47:22,900 --> 01:47:23,840
More mobility.

1429
01:47:24,820 --> 01:47:25,740
I don't think...

1430
01:47:25,740 --> 01:47:27,120
Girl, what the fuck even are you?

1431
01:47:28,860 --> 01:47:29,140
Alright.

1432
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:30,800
Oh?

1433
01:47:30,820 --> 01:47:33,100
This fucking rain is flooding our neighborhood.

1434
01:47:33,700 --> 01:47:34,940
We need this water gone.

1435
01:47:36,020 --> 01:47:37,480
Move quickly before the flooding.

1436
01:47:37,780 --> 01:47:39,060
Let's say what could cost...

1437
01:47:39,060 --> 01:47:40,340
Oh, we need speed.

1438
01:47:40,580 --> 01:47:41,020
Fuck.

1439
01:47:42,980 --> 01:47:43,580
Um...

1440
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:49,760
We'll put another in speed.

1441
01:47:50,900 --> 01:47:52,320
But we need speed, though.

1442
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:55,680
Like, do we want...

1443
01:47:55,680 --> 01:47:57,120
Which one do we want, guys?

1444
01:47:59,060 --> 01:48:00,200
Is it an all-arounder?

1445
01:48:00,280 --> 01:48:02,400
Do we want intelligence or charisma?

1446
01:48:06,230 --> 01:48:07,970
Or, like, all-arounder?

1447
01:48:08,350 --> 01:48:08,790

1471
01:49:49,250 --> 01:49:50,470
You're leveled up!

1472
01:49:52,250 --> 01:49:53,070
We need backup down here.

1473
01:49:53,310 --> 01:49:54,830
There's a mass pile up in the tanker caught fire.

1474
01:49:56,790 --> 01:49:57,850
The fire is growing.

1475
01:49:57,970 --> 01:49:58,670
Okay, Flambé.

1476
01:50:02,210 --> 01:50:04,330
We'll use fire to put out fire.

1477
01:50:05,730 --> 01:50:06,910
That's how it works, right?

1478
01:50:08,010 --> 01:50:09,730
He learns how to fly now, right?

1479
01:50:10,830 --> 01:50:15,410
So when our flies to cause, we're greatly reducing, and also
carries not...

1480
01:50:15,410 --> 01:50:16,110
Oh, shit, nice.

1481
01:50:16,230 --> 01:50:16,490
Okay.

1482
01:50:17,470 --> 01:50:18,230
Oh, shit.

1483
01:50:18,770 --> 01:50:19,090
Flambé.

1484
01:50:20,770 --> 01:50:23,970
Flambé is my fastest character.

1485
01:50:25,090 --> 01:50:26,570
Oh, my god.

1486
01:50:32,670 --> 01:50:33,050
Oh.

1487
01:50:38,510 --> 01:50:41,030
I can't send him in.

1488
01:50:41,110 --> 01:50:42,750
What are you talking about?

1489
01:50:44,470 --> 01:50:46,470
I'm trying to think right now.

1490
01:50:47,310 --> 01:50:49,690
Okay, because I can only send one of them in.

1491
01:50:50,190 --> 01:50:51,750
I didn't send Flambé here.

1492
01:50:52,790 --> 01:51:02,050
or there's no nobody's gonna come back in time I think I
have to send I'm sending Flambé to fight fire for fire yeah

1493
01:51:02,050 --> 01:51:09,190
I'm sending him he's gonna we're gonna fight fire with fire
let's go

1494
01:51:12,750 --> 01:51:22,350
there's nothing else I could do she's the only one here um
yeah it's fine the room's booked yeah Confirmed it this

1495
01:51:22,350 --> 01:51:22,630
morning.

1496
01:51:22,950 --> 01:51:23,370
We're all good.

1497
01:51:24,330 --> 01:51:25,670
That's how it works.

1498
01:51:26,590 --> 01:51:28,270
I want to see you all now.

1499
01:51:29,510 --> 01:51:30,970
Someone's going to fuck up.

1500
01:51:35,370 --> 01:51:36,150
Oh, shit.

1501
01:51:36,510 --> 01:51:37,510
Oh, shit.

1502
01:51:37,910 --> 01:51:38,090
Okay.

1503
01:51:38,790 --> 01:51:39,350
Okay.

1504
01:51:39,990 --> 01:51:45,130
Okay, apparently the fire versus... Okay, fire versus fire
strap was not it.

1505
01:51:46,970 --> 01:51:48,790
Who would have done?

1506
01:51:50,250 --> 01:51:51,530
Pray to RNG.

1507
01:51:51,810 --> 01:51:54,270
Oh my god, what is this?

1508
01:51:54,570 --> 01:51:57,130
What the fuck is this RNG?

1509
01:51:58,390 --> 01:52:01,050
All right, so several people have died today.

1510
01:52:03,510 --> 01:52:03,970
It's okay.

1511
01:52:04,110 --> 01:52:06,290
They just didn't, they missed their subscription yet.

1512
01:52:06,350 --> 01:52:08,170
Let's just say they missed their subscription.

1513
01:52:08,610 --> 01:52:09,370
Okay, team.

1514
01:52:10,330 --> 01:52:12,150
Good shift, all things considered.

1515
01:52:13,310 --> 01:52:13,850
See you tomorrow.

1516
01:52:14,670 --> 01:52:16,450
Hopefully with some good news.

1517
01:52:22,960 --> 01:52:23,480
Okay.

1518
01:52:23,480 --> 01:52:23,760
Okay.

1519
01:52:25,860 --> 01:52:26,880
Hey, Twinkies.

1520
01:52:27,820 --> 01:52:28,540
Aw, don't worry.

1521
01:52:28,760 --> 01:52:29,860
Michael's steak.

1522
01:52:31,560 --> 01:52:33,000
Finished it all.

1523
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:35,480
Okay.

1524
01:52:39,080 --> 01:52:40,780
Only 50 people dead today.

1525
01:52:42,100 --> 01:52:43,400
Guys, I lowered my record.

1526
01:52:44,620 --> 01:52:45,640
My lowest yet.

1527
01:52:49,020 --> 01:52:52,540
Wait, why are you guys fighting?

1528
01:52:55,400 --> 01:52:56,880
your personal best

1529
01:53:05,360 --> 01:53:16,260
you've got a little oh cheers lad good looking out just
paying for this okay who's gonna pay for this I'll pay I'm

1530
01:53:16,260 --> 01:53:26,560
the one that caused the damage with what oh oh okay cool now
that we got all of the details clear Aww.

1531
01:53:26,860 --> 01:53:27,180
Why?

1532
01:53:27,480 --> 01:53:29,160
That's just a difference of opinion.

1533
01:53:29,900 --> 01:53:32,160
I got heated, got in Golem's face.

1534
01:53:32,760 --> 01:53:34,420
He had every right to punt me through the wall.

1535
01:53:34,780 --> 01:53:34,980
Right.

1536
01:53:35,180 --> 01:53:37,640
It's a door and I got you were actually in his face.

1537
01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:40,120
More like ankle, which made him easier to kick.

1538
01:53:40,340 --> 01:53:41,960
What the fuck is going on?

1539
01:53:42,580 --> 01:53:43,620
We want her out.

1540
01:53:44,220 --> 01:53:44,520
What?

1541
01:53:44,700 --> 01:53:46,420
We basically took a board vote.

1542
01:53:47,080 --> 01:53:48,140
That's why we're in the board.

1543
01:53:48,220 --> 01:53:50,560
Why you're voting in these out?

1544
01:53:50,780 --> 01:53:52,860
I'm neither human nor reformed villain.

1545
01:53:53,640 --> 01:53:54,960
Nor particularly interested in this conversation.

1546
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:55,540
What did she do?

1547
01:53:56,060 --> 01:54:00,720
I only came in as I thought we were playing Magic the
Gathering tonight.

1548
01:54:01,900 --> 01:54:04,060
I am hoping we still may.

1549
01:54:06,380 --> 01:54:07,980
Who wants you to stay?

1550
01:54:08,520 --> 01:54:09,500
Just me.

1551
01:54:10,260 --> 01:54:10,660
Aww.

1552
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:17,540
But the team is more important than any one of us, so I
won't stand in the way.

1553
01:54:18,020 --> 01:54:19,080
You could have led with that.

1554
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:22,140
We heard about the suspension bullshit.

1555
01:54:23,120 --> 01:54:24,180
It ain't enough, Robert.

1556
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:25,780
Not for what she did.

1557
01:54:26,060 --> 01:54:33,280
to put everything we've been building at risk and for what
for me i like the bitch but she gotta go and by go we mean

1558
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:43,240

gonna defend her but that's what it is i'm defending her i

1559
01:54:43,240 --> 01:54:57,140
don't care look i probably don't say this she did it for me
but i'm we're a family and i'm here soon A few months ago,

1560
01:54:57,240 --> 01:55:00,900
you wouldn't have been already committed in the needs of the
Z team.

1561
01:55:01,120 --> 01:55:04,540
And if you did, if I can't have muscle mommy, I'll have her

1562
01:55:09,290 --> 01:55:16,630
Soon But I'm not cutting this ago We don't kick people when
they're down.

1563
01:55:17,030 --> 01:55:26,890
We lift them up and I believe of her what I believe of all
of you That her heart is in the right place It's what took

1564
01:55:26,890 --> 01:55:40,130
us from being a team to being this weird fucked up family
look you're hurting okay I get it I'm hurting we are all

from this first name that's for you lose Fuck, from me.

1573
01:57:08,190 --> 01:57:08,710
They're right.

1574
01:57:09,730 --> 01:57:11,110
I don't deserve anyone's forgiveness.

1575
01:57:11,970 --> 01:57:13,730
Anyone's help, anyone's love.

1576
01:57:14,150 --> 01:57:15,170
I love you, though.

1577
01:57:15,590 --> 01:57:16,810
Because I can never repay it.

1578
01:57:18,010 --> 01:57:20,830
Nothing I do will ever make up for what I've already done to
you.

1579
01:57:21,150 --> 01:57:22,050
I don't need you to repay it.

1580
01:57:22,050 --> 01:57:26,330
I hope getting the Astral Pulse back would help, but I
couldn't even do that.

1581
01:57:26,730 --> 01:57:29,330
Vizzy, you don't owe anyone anything, okay?

1582
01:57:30,310 --> 01:57:31,430
Least of all me.

1583
01:57:34,150 --> 01:57:37,450
Was there that night What are you saying?

1584
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:50,500
Oh I said my own thing but my asthma was getting worse and
they had an augment that could increase my life Bro what you

1585
01:57:50,500 --> 01:57:54,520
play Xbox to work for them paying down for years

1586
01:58:00,300 --> 01:58:01,780
You two please

1587
01:58:05,440 --> 01:58:07,420
But she also plays Xbox.

1588
01:58:17,170 --> 01:58:19,650
She was part of the game?

1589
01:58:21,150 --> 01:58:24,910
It is from this where she decided that being bad is bad.

1590
01:58:24,930 --> 01:58:27,970
I have to hold that cleared if I was able to do one thing.

1591
01:58:29,010 --> 01:58:30,470
She didn't do it.

1592
01:58:30,490 --> 01:58:32,410
There's a bomb on the back of my command undetected.

1593
01:58:45,220 --> 01:58:47,000
Wait, she's the one that puts a bomb?

1594
01:58:47,300 --> 01:58:48,320
Good news, buddy.

1595
01:58:48,820 --> 01:58:50,900
Trout says he just wants the Astral Pole.

1596
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:52,160
Which we all know.

1597
01:58:52,500 --> 01:58:53,860
Isn't really yours anyway.

1598
01:58:56,780 --> 01:58:58,840
Oh, it was never about me.

1599
01:59:03,260 --> 01:59:04,900
So, all the red...

1600
01:59:04,900 --> 01:59:06,220
So, they all knew about her.

1601
01:59:08,340 --> 01:59:10,720
Oh, and then she saw me and she's like, wait, he's cute.

1602
01:59:10,860 --> 01:59:11,740
I can't kill him.

1603
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:12,720
I know.

1604
01:59:15,220 --> 01:59:16,980
She let her...

1605
01:59:16,980 --> 01:59:18,340
Okay, guys, okay.

1606
01:59:18,740 --> 01:59:19,360
I'll see.

1607
01:59:19,600 --> 01:59:21,120
She let her pussy talk.

1608
01:59:26,100 --> 01:59:32,560
I quit the moment I placed it Do you keep I walked out
before it even blew

1609
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:45,380
My augments conveniently stopped working Oh So I signed up
for the Phoenix program the next day Wait how did it?

1610
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:56,540
Oh cause she didn't kill her Give me the chance to fuck your
life up twice I forgive you Well I forgive you So there, we

1611
01:59:56,540 --> 01:59:57,780
fucking chill out now.

1612
01:59:57,800 --> 01:59:59,420
Tokyo is so degenerate.

1613
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:00,280
You fucking forgive me?

1614
02:00:00,780 --> 02:00:04,160
You haven't even like processed what's going on.

1615
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:06,560
You did villain shit while you were a villain.

1616
02:00:06,840 --> 02:00:08,580
Does it change things that you dropped without me?

1617
02:00:08,840 --> 02:00:10,240
I forgive you though.

1618
02:00:10,260 --> 02:00:11,060
That's in the past.

1619
02:00:11,420 --> 02:00:13,460
You're not the same person that was there that night.

1620
02:00:13,580 --> 02:00:14,620
Neither am I.

1621
02:00:16,160 --> 02:00:19,180
That's sweet, but...

1622
02:00:20,180 --> 02:00:21,120
I feel numb.

1623
02:00:21,740 --> 02:00:24,300
Hey, stop making this feel like a goodbye.

02:01:00,330 --> 02:01:01,130
I thought you meant something.

1629
02:01:01,570 --> 02:01:02,170
Oh, whoa.

1630
02:01:02,810 --> 02:01:03,210

Oh, my God.

Everywhere.

1636
02:01:19,450 --> 02:01:20,950
Why the fuck would I lean out?

1637
02:01:21,090 --> 02:01:25,510
This was all I fucking put my career on the line.

1638
02:01:29,250 --> 02:01:31,730
I put my career on the line to keep her on the team.

1639
02:01:32,170 --> 02:01:33,730
I might as well lean in.

1640
02:01:33,870 --> 02:01:35,530
This was what I was building for.

1641
02:01:43,050 --> 02:01:45,790
Here's don't worry, the censorship will save me.

1642
02:01:47,090 --> 02:01:47,490
Alright, boy.

1643
02:01:47,650 --> 02:01:49,130
You boys don't stay up too late.

1644
02:02:01,420 --> 02:02:02,220
HR violation.

1645
02:02:02,980 --> 02:02:03,780
Let's go.

1646
02:02:04,620 --> 02:02:05,440
Face the U.S.

1647
02:02:05,480 --> 02:02:06,740
Super chat that you thank you.

1648
02:02:07,200 --> 02:02:09,200
I saw a story on SDN Hero.

1649
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:10,220
Got hurt last night.

1650
02:02:10,700 --> 02:02:12,040
Can't tell them it was track start.

1651
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:14,960
I want people to know what Chase did, but I don't know how
he'd feel.

1652
02:02:16,500 --> 02:02:23,680
or should i say it was invisible they messed up when we got
to her so it wouldn't be alive

1653
02:02:26,800 --> 02:02:35,580
invisible i just feel like oh my gosh she types types like
in wait why track start okay is it track start because it

1654
02:02:35,580 --> 02:02:45,840
would be a better ending because my first thought was
invisible chase is the hero yeah but like but i feel like if

1655
02:02:45,840 --> 02:02:54,640
we do if we're busy, then, uh, you dox you, you dox it.

1656
02:02:58,500 --> 02:03:01,480
But I can sip all the way.

1657
02:03:05,860 --> 02:03:09,340
Okay, we'll do, we'll do track start.

1658
02:03:12,100 --> 02:03:14,460
Dox for a dox, exactly.

1659
02:03:22,980 --> 02:03:25,940
You know the same way, thank you.

1660
02:03:38,530 --> 02:03:39,570
Doc's maxing.

1661
02:03:46,500 --> 02:03:49,140
I mean, I hope they all die.

1662
02:03:51,360 --> 02:03:52,300
I'm serious.

1663
02:03:53,480 --> 02:03:57,600
Any dumbass walking into a trap that fucking stupid should
have the plug pulled right now.

1664
02:03:58,180 --> 02:03:59,620
Just pillows over faces.

1665
02:04:00,740 --> 02:04:03,080
Oh man, have you seen what the poison does to their faces?

1666
02:04:03,540 --> 02:04:05,260
They get all red and puffy and...

1667
02:04:05,280 --> 02:04:06,160
Oh.

1668
02:04:07,440 --> 02:04:08,460
Oh, that's me.

1669
02:04:08,780 --> 02:04:09,880
I'm back at the villain bar.

1670
02:04:11,500 --> 02:04:12,500
I'm sorry.

1671
02:04:12,860 --> 02:04:13,640
It's my fault.

1672
02:04:14,300 --> 02:04:15,460
I've been distracting you.

1673
02:04:15,700 --> 02:04:16,820
Give me another drink.

1674
02:04:17,020 --> 02:04:17,700
Give me another drink.

1675
02:04:18,680 --> 02:04:19,460
I smashed mine.

1676
02:04:20,100 --> 02:04:20,320

1677
02:04:20,920 --> 02:04:21,660
You all right?

1678
02:04:22,280 --> 02:04:24,000
You seem perturbed.

1679
02:04:28,640 --> 02:04:29,960
Ah, fuck.

1680
02:04:30,220 --> 02:04:31,660
I know what's going on.

1681
02:04:32,040 --> 02:04:33,620
Kid probably lost someone there.

1682
02:04:34,160 --> 02:04:36,000

And he looks like a fucking nerd.

1690
02:05:21,920 --> 02:05:23,140

1709
02:07:09,250 --> 02:07:11,410
Why is this nerd in the village bar?

1710
02:07:11,530 --> 02:07:12,890
It has to be Troud.

1711
02:07:13,430 --> 02:07:14,670
This old-ass nerd.

1712
02:07:15,530 --> 02:07:17,330
I fucking knew it.

1713
02:07:17,450 --> 02:07:19,170
There's no solving human nature.

1714
02:07:19,430 --> 02:07:20,790
I damn knew that was him.

1715
02:07:20,970 --> 02:07:21,870
Fucking nerd-ass.

1716
02:07:22,450 --> 02:07:25,590
All you can do...

1717
02:07:25,710 --> 02:07:41,090
he's controlled it oh I believe him boss if he had something
to say he would have said it by now I thought you wanted

1718
02:07:41,090 --> 02:07:54,410
revenge this was your father's gun kept it in his locker
fully loaded six shots he couldn't have predicted I'd use it

1719
02:07:54,410 --> 02:07:57,750
to kill him The first bullet grazed his shoulder.

1720
02:07:58,590 --> 02:08:00,770
I hadn't adjusted to the adrenaline spike.

1721
02:08:00,850 --> 02:08:02,490
Wait, is that fired Sonar?

1722
02:08:02,770 --> 02:08:04,050
Would he join Trout?

1723
02:08:05,130 --> 02:08:05,690
Bro, what?

1724
02:08:05,710 --> 02:08:09,950
He's lying on the floor or I was full of fear when I put the
floor through his face.

1725
02:08:10,890 --> 02:08:15,110
A bit of a waste to put the fifth through that idiot's
skull, but I wanted to make sure it worked after all these

1726
02:08:15,110 --> 02:08:15,430
years.

1727
02:08:16,430 --> 02:08:18,030
What the fuck is Sonar gonna do?

1728
02:08:18,150 --> 02:08:19,050
Talk me to death?

1729
02:08:19,790 --> 02:08:22,350
Your father was the last person to touch this bullet.

1730
02:08:23,950 --> 02:08:24,830
And now...

1731
02:08:24,830 --> 02:08:25,650

If I had it wide, I let you stream me about a fucking
pinata.

1736
02:09:06,490 --> 02:09:08,890
She didn't get the pulse.

1737
02:09:08,970 --> 02:09:09,990
I won the gotcha.

1738
02:09:10,290 --> 02:09:10,470
Yay.

1739
02:09:11,410 --> 02:09:13,630
I trusted my gotcha a lot.

1740
02:09:13,910 --> 02:09:15,190
You actually believe that.

1741
02:09:16,390 --> 02:09:17,530
You show him.

1742
02:09:21,440 --> 02:09:21,860
What?

1743
02:09:22,360 --> 02:09:24,960
Invisibitch has the pulse that I know.

1744
02:09:25,740 --> 02:09:26,200
How?

1745
02:09:27,020 --> 02:09:28,400
What I don't know.

1746
02:09:28,420 --> 02:09:39,460
is why she didn't give it to you she played you too here I
am thinking she's working with you but she's fucking with

1751
02:10:36,640 --> 02:10:43,020
In five minutes this bar will be surrounded By SDN agents,
heroes, and whoever else you in your ring have pissed off

1752
02:10:43,020 --> 02:10:52,500

1754
02:11:06,300 --> 02:11:07,360
Why is she giving her a tip?

1755
02:11:07,500 --> 02:11:08,860
I can see I'm unnumbered.

1756
02:11:09,040 --> 02:11:10,560
That eventually I would fall.

1757
02:11:13,620 --> 02:11:16,120
But by my read...

1758
02:11:16,120 --> 02:11:19,380
I'm taking a lot of you with me.

1759
02:11:19,700 --> 02:11:20,000
Oh!

1760
02:11:21,280 --> 02:11:23,380
So all of you can leave now.

1761
02:11:25,560 --> 02:11:27,840
Or half of you can die here.

1762
02:11:33,380 --> 02:11:34,140
Orify me.

1763
02:11:34,320 --> 02:11:35,880
That's a fucking superhero.

1764
02:11:36,920 --> 02:11:37,520
Chills.

1765
02:11:38,600 --> 02:11:39,200
Top-notch.

1766
02:11:40,860 --> 02:11:42,100
You made them nervous.

1767
02:11:44,420 --> 02:11:45,920
Okay, we're out of here.

1768
02:11:47,220 --> 02:11:49,500
Take your piss-soaked pants out the back, please.

1769
02:11:50,580 --> 02:11:52,580
Don't want to tempt this tiger.

1770
02:11:56,920 --> 02:11:58,540
Now's not our time, Blazer.

1771
02:11:59,360 --> 02:12:01,240
But it's coming sooner than you think.

1772
02:12:02,820 --> 02:12:03,080
Oh.

1773
02:12:04,040 --> 02:12:07,300
And by my calculations, it was closer to 32%.

1774
02:12:10,440 --> 02:12:12,260
But half sounds better.

1775
02:12:14,640 --> 02:12:16,080
Yeah, she rounded up, guys.

1776
02:12:21,270 --> 02:12:21,630
Guys, look.

1777
02:12:22,510 --> 02:12:23,310
There's no...

1778
02:12:24,970 --> 02:12:25,430
There's...

1779
02:12:25,430 --> 02:12:26,250
Wait, can't believe you found...

1780
02:12:26,250 --> 02:12:27,870
I don't know how she found me first.

1781
02:12:28,210 --> 02:12:28,590
I don't see how to find me.

1782
02:12:29,630 --> 02:12:29,910
Yeah.

1783
02:12:30,290 --> 02:12:31,010
I tracked your phone.

1784
02:12:31,850 --> 02:12:32,150
Sorry.

1785
02:12:33,350 --> 02:12:34,730
I'll never forgive you.

1786
02:12:37,350 --> 02:12:38,710
Jesus, Saki.

1787
02:12:41,450 --> 02:12:41,890
Oh.

1788
02:12:42,530 --> 02:12:43,210
Don't worry.

1789
02:12:44,410 --> 02:12:44,690
Okay.

1790
02:12:47,770 --> 02:12:48,210
HR?

1791
02:12:48,590 --> 02:12:48,850
I know.

1792
02:12:49,090 --> 02:12:49,390
Ring, ring, ring.

1793
02:12:49,490 --> 02:12:51,110
I got another write-up for you.

1794
02:12:51,330 --> 02:12:52,290
Another citation.

1795
02:12:53,630 --> 02:12:55,830
She got you pretty bad.

1796
02:12:56,450 --> 02:12:58,710
Are you sure he's right about him?

1797
02:12:59,050 --> 02:12:59,490
Phenomenal.

1798
02:13:01,870 --> 02:13:03,350
I saw the footage.

1799
02:13:04,210 --> 02:13:05,070
What is her play?

1800
02:13:05,950 --> 02:13:07,370
Why wouldn't she tell you if she hasn't?

1801
02:13:07,450 --> 02:13:08,150
Oh, okay.

1802
02:13:08,210 --> 02:13:09,810
First of all, why are you tracking me?

1803
02:13:09,930 --> 02:13:11,290
I don't understand what she would want it for.

1804
02:13:11,310 --> 02:13:13,110
I trust her.

1805
02:13:13,470 --> 02:13:14,410
I trust her!

1806
02:13:14,470 --> 02:13:15,870
She's protecting me!

1807
02:13:17,270 --> 02:13:21,790
What matters is I trust her.

02:13:22,530 --> 02:13:23,650
I think you're more optimistic.

1809
02:13:23,710 --> 02:13:25,150
I think they fired HR.

1810
02:13:30,640 --> 02:13:31,860
You're probably right.

1811
02:13:34,880 --> 02:13:41,560

right as rain.

Okay, to be fair, 50% of them are SDN subscribers.

1822
02:15:02,880 --> 02:15:05,100
So we only have to stay 50% of the town.

1823
02:15:08,960 --> 02:15:10,440
Bro, that guy's a flasher.

Like, is that not...

1827

That power not exist in this fucking world?

1828
02:15:29,470 --> 02:15:30,890
GG's no support.

Yay.

1838
02:15:54,860 --> 02:15:56,680

02:16:03,320 --> 02:16:04,140

My dad smoked.

1847
02:16:49,800 --> 02:16:52,260
In Asia, pot smoking is, like, a norm.

1848
02:16:53,500 --> 02:16:58,120
Like, you could, in back then, you can, I think, I don't
know, you can still can, but, like, you could smoke in

1849
02:16:58,120 --> 02:16:58,740
restaurants.

1850
02:17:00,620 --> 02:17:03,400
Like, they have, like, each table will have a smoking tray.

1851
02:17:18,810 --> 02:17:27,270

is a lot more dangerous can you can make it taste like

Thank you.

1858
02:18:14,720 --> 02:18:16,480
That's, uh, you're a lifesaver.

1859
02:18:17,620 --> 02:18:19,500
Did he not go home?

1860
02:18:22,860 --> 02:18:24,260
I don't think he went home.

1861
02:18:24,380 --> 02:18:26,000
I think he went straight to work, bro.

1862
02:18:26,180 --> 02:18:26,180
What?

1863
02:18:26,600 --> 02:18:27,440
Nine to five.

1864
02:18:27,680 --> 02:18:28,820
A report coming in from the refinery.

1865
02:18:29,160 --> 02:18:31,440
Multiple augmented villains breaking containment.

1866
02:18:32,360 --> 02:18:34,080
Dispatch all available heroes in the area.

1867
02:18:34,640 --> 02:18:36,760
Boss, we don't have any heroes in the area.

1868
02:18:36,860 --> 02:18:37,060
What?

1869
02:18:37,280 --> 02:18:38,200
Can you handle things here?

1870
02:18:38,760 --> 02:18:39,720
Where are our heroes?

1871
02:18:39,940 --> 02:18:42,660

Let them die.

1877
02:19:16,100 --> 02:19:17,620
We can use whatever you can give.

1878
02:19:28,950 --> 02:19:29,430
Yeah, what?

1879
02:19:29,550 --> 02:19:30,310

1881
02:19:32,230 --> 02:19:32,930

Sorry.

1884
02:19:35,250 --> 02:19:36,170
I didn't mean it like that.

1885
02:19:36,410 --> 02:19:39,310
Thanks for getting out of bed or whatever you were up to.

1886
02:19:39,410 --> 02:19:42,870
Yeah, I'd say come here to fall asleep, so I might be just a
little.

1887
02:19:44,650 --> 02:19:46,370
Are you gonna finish your sentence, big man?

1888
02:19:46,730 --> 02:19:46,970
Huh?

1889
02:19:47,650 --> 02:19:48,050
No.

1890
02:19:48,670 --> 02:19:49,350
Oh, no.

1891
02:19:49,470 --> 02:19:50,630
He's fucking out of it.

1892
02:19:50,770 --> 02:19:51,750
Look, we're shorthand.

1893
02:19:52,230 --> 02:19:53,070
Technically for a prison.

1894
02:19:53,070 --> 02:19:56,170
We should have the rest of the team trickling in, so we'll
have to make do for now.

1895
02:19:56,470 --> 02:19:59,130
Lucky for us, we got the best three heroes on the roster.

1896
02:19:59,390 --> 02:20:01,770
We all know you'd say the same shit about whoever was here.

1897
02:20:01,790 --> 02:20:03,950
If we all know, then there's no reason to point it out.

1898
02:20:04,270 --> 02:20:04,930
Look alive.

1899
02:20:05,390 --> 02:20:07,670
Also, like, doesn't prison have concerts to do?

1900
02:20:08,550 --> 02:20:11,490
Like, I thought being a pop star makes you, like, extra
busy.

1901
02:20:16,270 --> 02:20:17,770
Like, I feel, oh, wait, what happens?

1902
02:20:17,910 --> 02:20:18,890
Oh, I guess there's...

1903
02:20:18,890 --> 02:20:19,750
Oh, whoa, oh!

1904
02:20:20,150 --> 02:20:20,530

1909
02:20:55,510 --> 02:20:58,810
Clear Red Ring grooms Protected Defenseless Employees.

1910
02:20:59,830 --> 02:21:00,510
Okay, um...

1911
02:21:00,510 --> 02:21:03,110
Red Ring just released an experiment from containment.

1912
02:21:03,390 --> 02:21:06,170
It's a, uh, big thing.

1913
02:21:06,510 --> 02:21:08,070
Oh, we'll just do.

1914
02:21:09,790 --> 02:21:11,230
We are crushing it, baby.

1915
02:21:11,410 --> 02:21:12,150
What do we want?

1916
02:21:12,630 --> 02:21:14,270
Wait, I should look at the other ones, too.

1917
02:21:17,290 --> 02:21:20,370
This year, but also last year and also the year before that.

1918
02:21:20,730 --> 02:21:21,370
And also...

1919
02:21:22,710 --> 02:21:24,690
Isn't that what we pay SDN for?

1920
02:21:25,330 --> 02:21:26,510
We're not evacuating.

1921
02:21:26,650 --> 02:21:27,490
Okay, you can...

1922
02:21:28,390 --> 02:21:30,930
Okay, yeah, we need to evacuate so you...

02:21:30,930 --> 02:21:32,510
All right, so I'll put you...

Fucking rocks.

1929
02:21:37,770 --> 02:21:38,930
You go solo this.

Um, we're gonna try and figure out...

1931
02:21:41,410 --> 02:21:43,030
Doppel's out there already, but...

1932
02:21:43,030 --> 02:21:45,710
Determine whether the package is a threat and dispose...

1933
02:21:46,650 --> 02:21:47,170
Uh...

1934
02:21:47,170 --> 02:21:47,970

02:21:48,290 --> 02:21:49,710
Okay, dispose of the...

1936
02:21:49,710 --> 02:21:50,510
Determine whether...

1937
02:21:50,510 --> 02:21:52,690
Okay, you're not that smart, so...

1938
02:21:52,710 --> 02:21:53,430

1939
02:21:54,550 --> 02:21:56,290
Oh, I'm going to put you on this.

1940
02:21:56,610 --> 02:21:58,350
There's a suspicious package outside of City Hall.

1941
02:21:59,450 --> 02:22:00,870
Please send someone to investigate.

1942
02:22:01,290 --> 02:22:02,770
Bomb squad is tied up.

1943
02:22:03,890 --> 02:22:05,310
Yeah, this is intelligence.

1944
02:22:06,150 --> 02:22:07,630
But she's not that smart.

1945
02:22:10,950 --> 02:22:12,370
She's not that smart.

1946
02:22:12,650 --> 02:22:15,770

Do you think Waterboy can solo this, guys?

2190
02:37:17,620 --> 02:37:18,860
It's his time.

I believe in water, boy.

2209
02:38:06,060 --> 02:38:07,880
Choosing each other or being red ring spies.

2210
02:38:08,300 --> 02:38:08,520
Um.

2211
02:38:11,560 --> 02:38:12,020

02:38:19,500 --> 02:38:21,200
We can't escort each other.

2218
02:38:23,580 --> 02:38:23,980
Alright.

02:38:24,260 --> 02:38:24,720

I want to know.

2225
02:38:34,200 --> 02:38:36,040

longer break off the ring red oh wait let me think about
this oh I can't attack you everything break off isn't that

Okay, okay, guys.

2237
02:39:33,040 --> 02:39:36,580

I will rescue the students.

2267
02:41:37,160 --> 02:41:37,960
They didn't have to die.

2268
02:41:40,440 --> 02:41:40,840
Phenomenon!

2269
02:41:43,820 --> 02:41:45,520
Okay, I have charisma.

2270

Is that rally them against the real enemy?

We can wait a little bit.

2457
02:52:46,810 --> 02:52:49,230
There's no one in actual immediate danger.

2458
02:52:50,650 --> 02:52:51,170

Wait, can I even send Blazer?

2643
03:03:34,770 --> 03:03:36,510
Oh, I can't send Blazer into this.

2644
03:03:36,610 --> 03:03:38,470
Because she only wants to see Blazer.

2645
03:03:39,690 --> 03:03:42,790
okay she actually has to heal someone

2646
03:03:53,210 --> 03:03:56,790

Take that copter out now.

2653
03:04:28,800 --> 03:04:30,620
Helicopters are annoying on the best of days.

2654
03:04:30,840 --> 03:04:32,500
I'll just send blonde blazer everywhere.

2655

2659
03:04:47,650 --> 03:04:49,370
When did it trigger it?

2660
03:04:49,930 --> 03:04:50,330
Why?

2661
03:04:58,420 --> 03:04:59,160
It's green!

2662
03:04:59,660 --> 03:05:00,840
We saw it!

2663
03:05:02,040 --> 03:05:03,400

2671
03:05:15,380 --> 03:05:15,860
Okay.

2672
03:05:16,000 --> 03:05:17,360
I just don't have intelligence.

2673
03:05:17,940 --> 03:05:19,520
It won't go on the other side, right?

2674
03:05:21,980 --> 03:05:23,920
Guys, it's not going to go.

2675
03:05:29,540 --> 03:05:30,840
Guys, it's not going to go.

2676
03:05:33,280 --> 03:05:35,260
It's because he got healed.

2677
03:05:38,340 --> 03:05:40,380

Nothing, like, this is it.

2824
03:20:03,360 --> 03:20:05,820
This is the only thing we're waiting on.

2825
03:20:08,820 --> 03:20:10,020
There's no way.

I've been stuck in this area for so fucking long to a point
where they stopped giving me missions.

2837
03:21:08,140 --> 03:21:09,920
It's literally just coop.

2886
03:26:08,070 --> 03:26:09,550
No, Mr. Whiskers.

03:26:26,940 --> 03:26:27,380
What?

2889
03:26:27,980 --> 03:26:28,560
Why are you looking?

2890
03:26:28,600 --> 03:26:31,280
You didn't lie to me, but you didn't tell me the truth.

2891
03:26:32,640 --> 03:26:33,780
She omitted information.

2892
03:26:36,440 --> 03:26:38,320
Why didn't you tell me?

2893
03:26:40,760 --> 03:26:42,600
I just don't understand why you wouldn't tell me.

2894
03:26:43,480 --> 03:26:46,000
I was worried Shroud would come after you.

2895
03:26:46,300 --> 03:26:46,780
Well, he did.

2896
03:26:47,120 --> 03:26:51,280
So if I gave it to you, he'd have the pulse right now.

2897
03:26:51,720 --> 03:26:53,960
I was trying to protect you.

2898
03:26:54,420 --> 03:26:55,960
Aww, that's so sweet.

2899
03:26:57,800 --> 03:26:59,520
Yeah, but at least I didn't die.

2900
03:26:59,780 --> 03:27:00,760
You did great, girl.

2901
03:27:02,560 --> 03:27:03,780

2904
03:27:26,800 --> 03:27:35,560

loose but his toolboxes are locked What did he do that for?

2905
03:27:36,000 --> 03:27:36,980
Oh, I fucking wonder, Vizzy.

2906
03:27:37,140 --> 03:27:40,060
Why would he lock up his tools around invisible criminal
thieves?

2907
03:27:41,180 --> 03:27:41,420
Robert!

2908
03:27:43,940 --> 03:27:46,200
Boy, there's a lot of people coming down now.

2909
03:27:46,660 --> 03:27:47,200
Oh, great.

2910
03:27:47,660 --> 03:27:47,920
Good.

2911
03:27:49,420 --> 03:27:51,240
I've trusted her this far.

2912
03:27:51,300 --> 03:27:52,180
Are we in kindergarten?

2913
03:27:52,760 --> 03:27:54,960
Guys, there's no going back.

2914
03:27:55,060 --> 03:27:56,380
I can't be like...

2915
03:27:56,380 --> 03:27:57,400
There's no backsees.

2916
03:27:57,540 --> 03:27:59,500
I've already stuck my neck out for her.

2917
03:27:59,940 --> 03:28:01,660
We still haven't hooked up yet.

2918
03:28:04,900 --> 03:28:06,340
I'm fully committed.

2919
03:28:06,500 --> 03:28:08,880
I will get the IRL hookup.

2920
03:28:09,620 --> 03:28:10,300
Oh, shit.

2921
03:28:11,660 --> 03:28:13,360
It's a quick time event time.

2922
03:28:22,160 --> 03:28:22,380
What?

2923
03:28:23,760 --> 03:28:25,420
Does he not see me?

2924
03:28:26,200 --> 03:28:30,300
He needs

2925
03:28:34,360 --> 03:28:35,780
to use the bathroom.

2926
03:28:37,220 --> 03:28:37,220
I

2927
03:28:42,330 --> 03:28:43,590
hate this place.

2928
03:28:43,830 --> 03:28:44,330
God, come on.

2929
03:28:44,650 --> 03:28:44,830
Open it.

2930
03:28:45,570 --> 03:28:45,930
Come on.

2931
03:28:48,260 --> 03:28:49,240
Alright, alright.

2932
03:28:49,400 --> 03:28:49,660
Fuck it.

2933
03:28:49,700 --> 03:28:50,020
Fuck it.

2934
03:28:50,180 --> 03:28:50,360
Okay.

2935
03:28:51,360 --> 03:28:54,400
Oh, why don't you pee before you come here?

2936
03:28:56,660 --> 03:28:57,540
Oh, shit.

2937
03:28:57,740 --> 03:28:59,440
While they're peeing, I feel like I should...

2938
03:28:59,440 --> 03:29:01,260
I feel like I should get the gun first.

2939
03:29:02,640 --> 03:29:03,100
Oh, I would...

2940
03:29:03,100 --> 03:29:03,740
I could...

2941
03:29:03,740 --> 03:29:05,620
It would shock his dick, though.

2942
03:29:09,160 --> 03:29:09,640
Oh.

2943
03:29:15,380 --> 03:29:17,240
Oh, I guess if it was like...

2944
03:29:17,240 --> 03:29:19,060
If I didn't untie her, she would have...

2945
03:29:19,060 --> 03:29:19,460
Ew.

2946
03:29:20,600 --> 03:29:23,020
If I didn't untie her, I had to use that.

2947
03:29:23,260 --> 03:29:23,640
Ew.

2948
03:29:24,320 --> 03:29:25,000

That's the rule.

2959
03:30:55,300 --> 03:30:56,860
Yeah, the gateway drug.

2960
03:30:58,040 --> 03:31:00,220

Oh, there it is.

03:31:08,370 --> 03:31:10,390
God, these guys are really bad shots.

03:31:13,230 --> 03:31:16,290

Break all their arms right before we kill them.

2973
03:32:37,290 --> 03:32:38,470
Super weird crime scene.

2974
03:32:38,970 --> 03:32:41,970
Or just give us the pulse and we'll let you live.

2975
03:32:42,450 --> 03:32:43,630
With broken fucking arms.

2976
03:32:44,430 --> 03:32:44,810
Of course.

2977
03:32:44,990 --> 03:32:45,530
Oh, God.

2978
03:32:46,050 --> 03:32:46,390
Each.

03:32:46,730 --> 03:32:47,550
Each one gets broken.

2980
03:32:47,550 --> 03:32:48,430
Everyone gets it.

2981
03:32:48,650 --> 03:32:48,870
Okay.

2982
03:32:49,190 --> 03:32:49,790
Where's Shroud?

2983
03:32:50,610 --> 03:32:51,530
You're making it weird.

2984
03:32:52,650 --> 03:32:53,390
Where's Shroud?

2985
03:32:53,570 --> 03:32:54,310
Where's Shroud?

2986
03:32:54,470 --> 03:32:55,430
Is that where you're asking?

2987
03:32:55,750 --> 03:32:56,150
Yeah.

2988
03:32:56,990 --> 03:32:58,670
I don't care about you guys.

2989
03:33:00,350 --> 03:33:02,570
What the fuck am I waiting for?

2990
03:33:03,150 --> 03:33:05,930
Hey Shad.

2991
03:33:07,230 --> 03:33:09,890
It's like real big but super quiet.

2992
03:33:10,690 --> 03:33:11,510
So cool.

2993
03:33:11,590 --> 03:33:12,690
These players are crazy.

2994
03:33:15,410 --> 03:33:17,650
Oh shit, what the fuck?

2995
03:33:28,050 --> 03:33:31,610
Your dad said he'd help me build a Mac if I helped him build
the Astral Pulse.

2996
03:33:32,570 --> 03:33:34,750
Just another promise he didn't control on.

2997
03:33:35,270 --> 03:33:39,670
Told you I knew it how are your stupid spider shit.

2998
03:33:40,030 --> 03:33:47,210
I've said in the beginning He I knew he made I had a feeling
he made the astral post like plugging your cell phone into a

2999
03:33:47,210 --> 03:33:58,370
nuclear reactor No hard to do that when you're dead I knew
it is going to be hard to pull off after I kill you Huh?

3000
03:33:59,910 --> 03:34:05,210
Oh They don't like that How did he know

3001
03:34:14,490 --> 03:34:22,590
Energy blades Melee time Oh, sure, one for gut bullet
Because it's cooler Wait, what?

3002
03:34:23,790 --> 03:34:30,850
Oh, shit, I got confused I got confused with the cutscene
With the quick time event

3003
03:34:36,320 --> 03:34:39,420
Okay, that quick time event confused me It was so fast

3004
03:34:42,540 --> 03:34:47,180
Gun versus sword, let's go It is cooler, though.

3005
03:34:49,640 --> 03:34:50,640
Cluster bomb!

3006
03:34:54,640 --> 03:34:56,000
That's looking right.

3007
03:35:05,780 --> 03:35:10,160
Bro, he's stream sniping me.

3008
03:35:12,940 --> 03:35:14,660
He's like screen peeking.

3009
03:35:17,120 --> 03:35:19,420
Okay, he's a lot bigger.

3010
03:35:19,960 --> 03:35:21,460
That new car shine.

3011
03:35:24,680 --> 03:35:25,800
Blonde Blazer!

3012
03:35:28,320 --> 03:35:29,580
You were late.

3013
03:35:30,620 --> 03:35:33,280
My calculations had you showing up 30 seconds ago.

3014
03:35:34,680 --> 03:35:35,940
Sorry to disappoint.

3015
03:35:36,440 --> 03:35:37,440
Oh, never mind.

3016
03:35:38,040 --> 03:35:40,940
I can't tell you how boring life is without surprises.

3017
03:35:43,000 --> 03:35:46,540
Well, then it's a good thing I can't even predict what these
idiots are gonna do.

3018
03:35:48,440 --> 03:35:49,620
Wait, the Z-Team?

3019
03:35:51,280 --> 03:35:52,020
Oh!

3020
03:35:52,620 --> 03:35:53,480
Oh, it's Prism!

3021
03:35:57,900 --> 03:35:59,340
Let's go!

3022
03:36:03,730 --> 03:36:04,840
Z Team!

3023
03:36:06,220 --> 03:36:08,100
With the power of friendship!

3024
03:36:11,620 --> 03:36:12,600
Oh yeah, no, he's dead.

3025
03:36:12,960 --> 03:36:14,240
Yeah, no, he's fucking dead.

3026
03:36:15,700 --> 03:36:16,920
Z Team assemble!

3027
03:36:20,100 --> 03:36:21,300
Okay, baby.

3028
03:36:21,600 --> 03:36:24,400
It doesn't matter if I'm fighting one or all of you.

3029
03:36:24,640 --> 03:36:25,880
The outcome is the same.

3030
03:36:27,200 --> 03:36:27,820
Okay.

3031
03:36:28,460 --> 03:36:31,760
Okay, I'm more aware now of these quick time events.

3032
03:36:35,920 --> 03:36:37,480
Bro, it doesn't even matter.

3033
03:36:37,580 --> 03:36:38,920
They just dodge everything.

3034
03:36:40,640 --> 03:36:41,400
Oh, God.

3035
03:36:41,680 --> 03:36:42,320
Waterboy.

3036
03:36:43,600 --> 03:36:44,960
Oh, man.

3037
03:36:48,720 --> 03:36:49,940
Damn, waterboy.

3038
03:36:49,960 --> 03:36:50,660
boy

3039
03:37:01,460 --> 03:37:23,520
Oh shit Oh my god reflection with the power wambles He
touched one ball Now it's everywhere Too slow.

3040
03:37:24,060 --> 03:37:25,060
Do you mean I hit?

3041
03:37:25,400 --> 03:37:26,240
How am I too slow?

3042
03:37:26,440 --> 03:37:27,060
I hit it!

3043
03:37:28,760 --> 03:37:30,620
I actually hit it!

3044
03:37:34,580 --> 03:37:37,360
What happens when I don't hit the quick time event?

3045
03:37:37,780 --> 03:37:38,920
It can't be slow anymore!

3046
03:37:38,940 --> 03:37:41,500
I hope my saving from collision was appropriate.

3047
03:37:41,960 --> 03:37:43,400
It was phenomenal.

3048
03:37:51,580 --> 03:37:52,560
Oh, shit.

3049
03:37:55,900 --> 03:37:56,340
Nice.

3050
03:37:56,820 --> 03:37:57,580
Nice shot.

3051
03:37:58,180 --> 03:37:58,780
You know what?

3052
03:37:59,180 --> 03:38:00,600
I definitely had that.

3053
03:38:00,860 --> 03:38:01,320
Oh, great.

3054
03:38:01,540 --> 03:38:02,640
Well, I'll just go then.

3055
03:38:03,740 --> 03:38:04,700
Bro, no jokes, guys.

3056
03:38:04,880 --> 03:38:05,760
We're fighting people.

3057
03:38:08,120 --> 03:38:08,700
Guys, come by.

3058
03:38:08,780 --> 03:38:10,600
We never finished our dance, Mecha Man.

3059
03:38:12,980 --> 03:38:14,860
Actually, I got the guy for you.

3060
03:38:16,800 --> 03:38:17,240
Oh.

3061
03:38:17,360 --> 03:38:21,160
Wow, you really think this little fucking lucky charm is a
match for me?

3062
03:38:21,460 --> 03:38:22,720
He's got a special move.

3063
03:38:22,820 --> 03:38:23,160
What is it?

3064
03:38:23,200 --> 03:38:24,020
Oh, ball punch!

3065
03:38:24,900 --> 03:38:26,820
Oh, because his dick's out!

3066
03:38:28,820 --> 03:38:30,860
No, ending the bloodline today.

3067
03:38:31,640 --> 03:38:33,120
Where'd you come from?

3068
03:38:34,000 --> 03:38:35,160
Oh shit, shit.

3069
03:38:35,440 --> 03:38:36,740
He asked- he didn't calculate this.

3070
03:38:43,370 --> 03:38:44,950
I see you.

3071
03:38:45,930 --> 03:38:46,870
He's a bull.

3072
03:38:48,550 --> 03:38:50,050
He should be fine, right?

3073
03:38:51,650 --> 03:38:53,130
Robert, this isn't working.

3074
03:38:53,410 --> 03:38:56,630
He knows our next move before we- Oh, he keeps stream
sniping us.

3075
03:38:56,650 --> 03:39:00,430
Oh, no.

3076
03:39:00,890 --> 03:39:01,650
Oh, no, it's cool.

3077
03:39:07,390 --> 03:39:08,330
Wait, what do we do?

3078
03:39:08,550 --> 03:39:10,430
I've never been more insulted in my life.

3079
03:39:11,390 --> 03:39:12,250
You fire me.

3080
03:39:12,650 --> 03:39:16,350
A literal assassin for some moronic bum fuck bad boy.

3081
03:39:16,350 --> 03:39:17,310
Yeah, but he has a degree.

3082
03:39:18,170 --> 03:39:19,070
Did you know that?

3083
03:39:19,570 --> 03:39:21,410
Ask the cleaners how much guano they come across.

3084
03:39:22,050 --> 03:39:23,730
Looks like I was right, though.

3085
03:39:25,250 --> 03:39:26,350
By the looks of things.

3086
03:39:26,650 --> 03:39:27,890
I made the right decision.

3087
03:39:28,050 --> 03:39:28,490
That's right.

3088
03:39:28,970 --> 03:39:31,350
Um, he has a very successful YouTube channel.

3089
03:39:31,970 --> 03:39:33,090
What do you have?

3090
03:39:36,090 --> 03:39:37,890
Yeah, do you have a degree?

3091
03:39:39,270 --> 03:39:40,470
I hit it!

3092
03:39:40,830 --> 03:39:43,070
What happens if I don't hit it?

3093
03:39:45,010 --> 03:39:49,910
What's the point of me succeeding quick time events if I
still get it?

3094
03:39:50,010 --> 03:39:51,490
You're not the boss of me, bitch.

3095
03:39:51,730 --> 03:39:54,390
So you don't get to tell me who and who not to murder
anymore.

3096
03:39:56,090 --> 03:39:56,550
Hey.

3097
03:39:56,650 --> 03:39:57,530
We're your friends.

3098
03:39:58,410 --> 03:39:59,610
Please, this isn't you.

3099
03:40:00,450 --> 03:40:03,250
Help us stop Shroud and earn your spot back on the Z-Team.

3100
03:40:11,710 --> 03:40:12,950
That's where you're wrong.

3101
03:40:13,850 --> 03:40:15,190
I thought I had friends.

3102
03:40:16,030 --> 03:40:18,650
But you made me realize I never actually did.

3103
03:40:19,450 --> 03:40:21,770
So now, I'm just doing what's right for me.

3104
03:40:22,770 --> 03:40:23,570
Oh, shit.

3105
03:40:26,490 --> 03:40:27,430
Z-Team.

3106
03:40:28,270 --> 03:40:29,550
What a stupid name.

3107
03:40:32,110 --> 03:40:32,590
No,

3108
03:40:36,690 --> 03:40:38,770
I'm not fix I have to fix someone else right now.

3109
03:40:38,830 --> 03:40:50,650
I can't fix two people I'll try to get you an opening Guys,
I can't fix everyone I have I'm at my limits

3110
03:40:56,110 --> 03:40:58,290
One one lady prefix

3111
03:41:06,850 --> 03:41:09,670
There you go.

3112
03:41:09,670 --> 03:41:11,150
Five wings.

3113
03:41:14,230 --> 03:41:16,990
Is she gonna die?

3114
03:41:19,510 --> 03:41:20,450
Oh, oh.

3115
03:41:21,750 --> 03:41:23,210
Wait, but I hit it.

3116
03:41:25,850 --> 03:41:27,630
Did not hit it?

3117
03:41:29,010 --> 03:41:31,750
Oh shit!

3118
03:41:32,850 --> 03:41:33,510
Oh shit!

3119
03:41:46,140 --> 03:41:47,000
Yay!

3120
03:41:48,620 --> 03:41:50,100
Flying people.

3121
03:41:50,820 --> 03:41:51,340
Okay, stay focused.

3122
03:41:51,580 --> 03:41:52,550
Sorry, I'm gonna stay focused.

3123
03:42:01,560 --> 03:42:03,280
Laugh forever.

3124
03:42:12,540 --> 03:42:13,500
Oh, shit.

3125
03:42:13,920 --> 03:42:14,700
Bye, arm.

3126
03:42:16,400 --> 03:42:17,020
Calm down.

3127
03:42:17,140 --> 03:42:18,060
It was your weak hand.

3128
03:42:18,240 --> 03:42:19,220
You can still jerk off.

3129
03:42:21,540 --> 03:42:25,180
Maybe if you grip it with the seven one, hold it with...

3130
03:42:25,180 --> 03:42:25,800
Yeah, you know what?

3131
03:42:26,000 --> 03:42:26,300
Fair enough.

3132
03:42:27,480 --> 03:42:28,920
It's not even his real arm.

3133
03:42:29,020 --> 03:42:29,680
He's fine.

3134
03:42:36,220 --> 03:42:37,840
Just attach another arm.

3135
03:42:47,320 --> 03:42:47,560
What?

3136
03:42:51,490 --> 03:42:51,970
No!

3137
03:42:52,430 --> 03:42:53,610
Oh, he wanted...

3138
03:42:53,610 --> 03:42:53,910
Oh!

3139
03:42:54,370 --> 03:42:54,810
Oh!

3140
03:43:07,820 --> 03:43:08,760
It'll be fine, right?

3141
03:43:13,400 --> 03:43:14,600
Oh my god.

3142
03:43:16,180 --> 03:43:17,360
I'm trying to find...

3143
03:43:19,120 --> 03:43:20,880
I'm locking in so hard.

3144
03:43:21,820 --> 03:43:23,900
Oh my god, this scene is so well done.

3145
03:43:24,100 --> 03:43:25,700
This scene is sick as fuck, though.

3146
03:43:26,360 --> 03:43:27,980
The animation for the fight.

3147
03:43:29,460 --> 03:43:30,320
Oh my god, I'm playing Osu!

3148
03:43:32,140 --> 03:43:34,060
Yeah, I was like, wait, this is Osu!

3149
03:43:40,500 --> 03:43:41,260
Okay.

3150
03:43:46,100 --> 03:43:47,200
Yeah, you are.

3151
03:43:58,100 --> 03:43:58,860
What?

3152
03:44:03,900 --> 03:44:04,200
What?

3153
03:44:05,140 --> 03:44:05,180
Chase?

3154
03:44:06,120 --> 03:44:06,440
Chase?

3155
03:44:06,440 --> 03:44:07,940
How long was I out?

3156
03:44:08,680 --> 03:44:09,440
Chase?

3157
03:44:10,920 --> 03:44:11,680
Blazer?

3158
03:44:12,980 --> 03:44:14,140
What the fuck happened?

3159
03:44:14,680 --> 03:44:15,740
Wait, she...

3160
03:44:15,740 --> 03:44:17,660
You're not the only one who wasn't born with powers.

3161
03:44:18,380 --> 03:44:18,920
Wait.

3162
03:44:19,640 --> 03:44:21,200
She gave it to Chase?

3163
03:44:23,340 --> 03:44:24,240
Holy shit.

3164
03:44:25,160 --> 03:44:25,540
Look at you.

3165
03:44:25,800 --> 03:44:26,880
Oh, look at you.

3166
03:44:28,140 --> 03:44:28,240
What?

3167
03:44:33,700 --> 03:44:34,880
She's not blocked.

3168
03:44:35,100 --> 03:44:37,700
She's not a muscle ma- Everything was a lie.

3169
03:44:38,700 --> 03:44:40,280
Everything was a fucking lie.

3170
03:44:41,440 --> 03:44:46,060
She was never a muscle ma- Hazel always did have a soft spot
for helpless losers.

3171
03:44:47,140 --> 03:44:47,980
Fuck off.

3172
03:44:56,660 --> 03:44:58,260
It's so, it's over.

3173
03:45:13,190 --> 03:45:13,890
Oh shit!

3174
03:45:15,350 --> 03:45:16,090
Fast NATO!

3175
03:45:19,570 --> 03:45:21,810
I guess, I don't know how he didn't predict the old.

3176
03:45:21,930 --> 03:45:25,550
I guess he didn't think the old man was in the equation.

3177
03:45:30,580 --> 03:45:31,060
Fuck.

3178
03:45:31,300 --> 03:45:32,960
I'm going to make love to you.

3179
03:45:35,460 --> 03:45:36,640
You a hoi.

3180
03:45:37,540 --> 03:45:38,480
You such a hoi.

3181
03:45:38,880 --> 03:45:40,060
Bro, you just hugged everyone?

3182
03:45:40,920 --> 03:45:42,420
I thought we were special.

3183
03:45:47,490 --> 03:45:49,670
Oh my god, we're not special.

3184
03:45:51,810 --> 03:45:53,570
Oh, you didn't know about Blazer's powers?

3185
03:45:54,010 --> 03:45:54,310
Oh!

3186
03:45:56,950 --> 03:45:57,930
I see.

3187
03:45:58,850 --> 03:46:02,030
You didn't realize what Blazer's actual powers come from.

3188
03:46:11,170 --> 03:46:13,850
Wait, why did the middle finger get censored?

3189
03:46:14,410 --> 03:46:16,510
I said profanity okay.

3190
03:46:21,670 --> 03:46:22,090
Oh, shit.

3191
03:46:22,650 --> 03:46:24,270
I looked at chat for one second.

3192
03:46:31,290 --> 03:46:33,050
Super spirit bomb!

3193
03:46:36,230 --> 03:46:36,630
Yeah!

3194
03:46:44,330 --> 03:46:45,630
Raise your hands!

You knew?

3235
03:49:53,100 --> 03:49:57,680
That she'd steal that soft heart of yours like everything
else she's robbed.

3236
03:49:58,420 --> 03:50:00,140
Bro, that's why we planted her here.

3237
03:50:01,540 --> 03:50:03,920
She thought she had a chance with me.

3238
03:50:05,520 --> 03:50:14,380
she she thought she had a chat she's like what you hooked up
with envisaged and not me she works for us too she gets two

3240
03:50:26,100 --> 03:50:36,960

theory on this moment a thousand times and that's the game

3244
03:51:12,760 --> 03:51:15,540

him both you won't know what the fuck is this robert you

03:51:35,520 --> 03:51:39,160
said you wanted the astropulse I gave it to you.

3247
03:51:40,020 --> 03:51:41,300
One of those is it's...

3248
03:51:41,300 --> 03:51:43,400
They look fucking identical, Robert.

3249
03:51:43,580 --> 03:51:44,900
Look, you're right.

3250
03:51:45,120 --> 03:51:46,400
I can't outsmart you.

3251
03:51:46,420 --> 03:51:48,080
Yeah, but he doesn't remember which one's fake.

3252
03:51:48,280 --> 03:51:48,640
You know what?

3253
03:51:48,660 --> 03:51:49,720
I'm not a smart guy.

3254
03:51:49,860 --> 03:51:50,920
Yeah, I'll be like, I don't know.

3255
03:51:50,980 --> 03:51:57,460
The only way to keep you from knowing what I'm doing is to
not have any idea what I'm doing, which is how I feel all

3256
03:51:57,460 --> 03:51:57,960
the time.

3257
03:51:59,280 --> 03:52:04,520
But I trust my gut, and I take my best guess, just like it
used to do.

3258
03:52:05,400 --> 03:52:13,320
Before you plugged all those fucking Christmas lights head

04:02:27,560 --> 04:02:30,400
But like good bad or bad, bad.

3366
04:02:31,820 --> 04:02:33,840

We have to talk to HR about that.

3410
04:06:24,760 --> 04:06:26,000
We have HR!

3411
04:06:26,740 --> 04:06:27,680
I haven't thought about that.

3412
04:06:27,760 --> 04:06:28,340
I'm joking.

3413
04:06:28,820 --> 04:06:29,340
Oh, thank God.

3414
04:06:29,540 --> 04:06:30,280

Thank fucking God.

3416
04:06:34,020 --> 04:06:35,120
Best joke of the night.

04:06:35,380 --> 04:06:35,820
So we're good.

3418
04:06:36,180 --> 04:06:36,720

04:06:37,540 --> 04:06:38,260

Make her happy.

3421
04:06:45,580 --> 04:06:47,840
Because God knows she's fucking miserable.

3422
04:06:48,280 --> 04:06:48,500
Jesus.

3423
04:06:50,420 --> 04:06:51,600
But that's my girlfriend.

3424
04:06:54,360 --> 04:06:55,840
I'm fixing her.

3425
04:06:59,800 --> 04:07:02,020
So does this mean the team's off Monday?

3426
04:07:03,200 --> 04:07:06,200
I was just trying to figure that out.

3427
04:07:06,280 --> 04:07:08,800
Robert sucks.

3428
04:07:09,280 --> 04:07:10,240
Robert sucks.

3429
04:07:10,740 --> 04:07:11,380
Robert sucks.

3430
04:07:11,640 --> 04:07:13,440
I think you might need to go.

3431
04:07:14,540 --> 04:07:16,660
I need to take this young man if you don't mind.

3432
04:07:17,320 --> 04:07:18,020
By all means.

3433
04:07:20,500 --> 04:07:21,440
Robert sucks.

3434
04:07:21,800 --> 04:07:22,680
Robert sucks.

3435
04:07:22,680 --> 04:07:22,920
Robert sucks.

3436
04:07:23,120 --> 04:07:24,060
I was wrong about business.

3437
04:07:24,460 --> 04:07:25,500
She didn't actually kill me.

3438
04:07:25,620 --> 04:07:26,180
Just almost.

3439
04:07:27,060 --> 04:07:28,500
Now let's see if I can make you throw up.

3440
04:07:29,800 --> 04:07:30,000
What?

3441
04:07:31,020 --> 04:07:31,160
What?

3442
04:07:50,390 --> 04:07:56,390
Wait, how did I somehow end up with a good ending?

3443
04:07:56,570 --> 04:08:00,350
I thought you guys said I'm destined for a bad ending.

3444
04:08:00,890 --> 04:08:02,470
This is pretty good.

3445
04:08:03,350 --> 04:08:04,630
I told you.

3446
04:08:04,950 --> 04:08:05,770
I'm wrong.

3447
04:08:05,870 --> 04:08:28,050
I told you guys I'm Robin that was the best choice I barely
saved it I told you I do it I was like I fight no no matter

3448
04:08:28,050 --> 04:08:31,690
what Robert wins

3449
04:08:35,870 --> 04:08:37,870
I saved it

3450
04:08:41,230 --> 04:08:44,170
How many endings do they have

3451
04:08:51,060 --> 04:08:56,460
Never punished I told you never punished oh two Four?

3452
04:08:56,900 --> 04:08:57,800
Wait, what are two?

3453
04:09:00,120 --> 04:09:00,880
Four?

3454
04:09:01,380 --> 04:09:02,860
Is it two or four?

3455
04:09:03,140 --> 04:09:07,000
All right, what are the four endings?

3456
04:09:09,380 --> 04:09:10,960
Was mine the best ending?

3457
04:09:15,100 --> 04:09:18,260
Oh, two romance endings, two good or bad.

3458
04:09:25,580 --> 04:09:26,460
Thought Squad.

3459
04:09:27,000 --> 04:09:28,040

Been a nice finishing night game with you, Joki.

3462
04:09:37,100 --> 04:09:39,680
Story was great, but the dispatch gameplay seems
disconnected.

3463
04:09:39,860 --> 04:09:41,120
Looking forward to the next game.

3464
04:09:41,200 --> 04:09:42,220

04:13:56,460 --> 04:13:57,840
the Double spin ability.

3527
04:13:58,260 --> 04:14:05,880
So there were times where I've lost 280% in a, like, like
twice in one, in one instance.

3528
04:14:06,280 --> 04:14:07,900
Because he has double chance.

3529
04:14:09,020 --> 04:14:10,300
That was the worst part.

3530
04:14:10,460 --> 04:14:12,280
You barely succeeded a call.

3531
04:14:16,520 --> 04:14:19,500
And every man you're robber always kept everyone guessing
what he'll say.

3532
04:14:19,940 --> 04:14:22,200
What he'll say or do next?

3533
04:14:22,400 --> 04:14:22,980
That's me.

3534
04:14:26,040 --> 04:14:26,880
For him better than...

3535
04:14:26,880 --> 04:14:27,240
Yay!

3536
04:14:27,720 --> 04:14:28,260
Look at that.

3537
04:14:28,380 --> 04:14:30,360
I prefer them better than 7% of theirs.

3538
04:14:30,960 --> 04:14:32,620
Across all ships, too.

3539
04:14:33,780 --> 04:14:35,140
You barely succeeded.

3540
04:14:36,640 --> 04:14:38,620
Ship was the last episode.

3541
04:14:38,900 --> 04:14:40,120
Oh, phase two.

3542
04:14:42,060 --> 04:14:43,800
That was phase two.

3543
04:14:43,920 --> 04:14:46,260
I did not feel like the most successful.

3544
04:14:46,800 --> 04:14:47,540
I'm Robert.

3545
04:14:47,820 --> 04:14:49,560
I'm Robert, guys.

3546
04:14:52,480 --> 04:14:53,640
That's insane.

3547
04:14:54,280 --> 04:14:56,340
I can't, but I'm so good at this game.

3548
04:15:00,520 --> 04:15:09,100
wow that was fun i understand the hype now i had oh yeah um
one of my friends um who's obsessed with dispatch i think it

3549
04:15:09,100 --> 04:15:14,620
was like yesterday they were like oh if you look oh do you
see anything funny when you because like you know how

3550
04:15:14,620 --> 04:15:23,880

was like told me like oh there's an easter egg uh for the

3551
04:15:23,880 --> 04:15:34,300
the heroes for the id cards and i was like like they like

was like boobies like instantly yeah so yeah so like i no

3553
04:15:46,480 --> 04:15:54,140
hesitation and then my friend was like how did you know that
fast and i'm like because chat keeps sending me passwords

3554
04:15:54,140 --> 04:16:02,660
every time i ask for a password chat would be like boobs and
I'm like it's not boobs and then my chat would be like

3555
04:16:02,660 --> 04:16:11,780
boobies so I recognize instantly whenever I see the numbers
I can instantly tell if you guys fucking type me boobies or

3559
04:16:31,700 --> 04:16:33,360
It's not boobs.

3560
04:16:36,200 --> 04:16:39,480
One day, it's going to be.

3561
04:16:39,800 --> 04:16:49,180

sneak that one in for whatever AAA or successful indie game

is going to be.

3563
04:16:50,200 --> 04:16:51,060
That's your goal.

3564
04:16:51,320 --> 04:16:55,200
To make a password where it'll actually be boobies for once.

3565
04:16:55,300 --> 04:16:56,540
Or boobs.
