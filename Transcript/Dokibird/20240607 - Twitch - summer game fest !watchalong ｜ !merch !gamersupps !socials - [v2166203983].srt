1
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:57,860
Sorry, I was too busy saying my shit that I didn't realize the starting speech was about to end.

2
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:06,140
All I'm saying is, why would you pay a ticket to sit in a seat to watch trailers?

3
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,080
I don't understand!

4
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,800
I was like, why are there people sitting there in the audience?

5
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,700
You don't need the audience!

6
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,000
You're literally just watching trailers!

7
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,580
Like, I understand if it's the Game Awards, you know?

8
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,220
Because they're awarding stuff, but...

9
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,560
But there is literally just a summer game fest!

10
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,620
There's so many people there too!

11
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,380
And it's live!

12
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,100
Maybe they're paid actors.

13
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,280
Oh, just like the Oscars.

14
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,660
I don't know if you guys know this.

15
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,440
Oh, that's true.

16
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,700
There might be demos to play.

17
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,860
But yeah, but a lot of them...

18
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,120
A lot of demos are released on Steam.

19
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,580
So, yeah.

20
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,580
A lot of demos are already going to be released on Steam right after.

21
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,500
Just like the Oscars.

22
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:10,360
I don't know if you guys know this, but in the Oscars, they actually have paid...

23
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:15,720
They have paid actors that sit on the chair to make it so that the seats aren't empty.

24
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,920
So it could just be like the Oscars.

25
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,220
So should we get to the games?

26
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,380
Alright, it all begins right now.

27
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:23,940
Yeah, it's true.

28
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,860
It's true.

29
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,460
Here's our first announcement.

30
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:30,160
When people have to do bathroom breaks in the Oscars, they actually...

31
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,520
Wait, Lego.

32
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:31,980
Nice.

33
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,900
But there's always a Lego game, so I'm not as hyped.

34
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,180
But in the Oscars, if people go to the bathroom, they bring in paid actors.

35
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,600
Actual paid actors to go and sit in the seat so it looks like it's not empty.

36
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,820
Even during, like, bathroom breaks.

37
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,840
Hey, what game is this anyway?

38
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:52,760
What game?

39
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,680
Yeah, what game is it?

40
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,960
Are they gonna bring back GTA Legos?

41
00:03:59,260 --> 00:03:59,960
What's this?

42
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,180
Oh, it's that girl!

43
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,760
The one I played one playthrough of and then stopped.

44
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,940
Horizon, yeah!

45
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,100
This dog guy is Aloy.

46
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,100
An amazing video game lead.

47
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,780
A thunder jar went mad and his terror threw the valley.

48
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,260
Don't worry, I'll bring it down.

49
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,000
Oh my god!

50
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,420
Genshin... The girl in Genshin Impact, guys!

51
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,860
A lonely hero, hunting machines all by herself.

52
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:29,360
Hello!

53
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,600
I have friends, you know.

54
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,300
Let's do this!

55
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:31,940
Right.

56
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,820
A friendly hero, hunting with her...

57
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,140
Is that it?

58
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,240
Why does this game need a Lego game?

59
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,660
That's actually... I mean, okay.

60
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,480
All I'm saying is like, I don't think Horizon needed a Lego game.

61
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,900
This is what I want!

62
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,640
I am the two people that wanted this!

63
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,400
Who asked for this?

64
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,020
Marble asked for this, guys!

65
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,560
Marble is one of the two people that filled in the feedback form for Lego crossovers.

66
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,700
Everything needs a Lego spaceship.

67
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,320
Just play Fortnite, it's free.

68
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,540
It's free Lego.

69
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,980
Father, thank you for the Twitch Prime!

70
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:33,880
Thank you, thank you!

71
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,680
Hey guys, I know we said rest week, but in the end, it was more so of...

72
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,260
It was more so of like Twitch week instead.

73
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,420
Oh, it's on... Is it only on the Switch?

74
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:45,860
There you go.

75
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,840
Wasn't that fun?

76
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,520
That was Lego Horizon Adventures.

77
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,160
Coming out later this year for PlayStation 4.

78
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,140
But also day one on PC and Nintendo Switch.

79
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:54,380
Oh, okay.

80
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,340
Day one on PC.

81
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,020
I was gonna be like, that's fucked up.

82
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,040
If it's only on the Switch.

83
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,700
But like, also, who asked for this?

84
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:09,440
...from Torn Banner Studios, the developers behind Chivalry 2.

85
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,820
For their next project, they are proud to announce No More Room in Hell 2.

86
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,720
The sequel to the 2011 award-winning Source mod.

87
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:21,000
Eight players start separate in the dark, and it's up to you to find your...

88
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,180
Wait, I've heard of this game.

89
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,400
...and survive with permadeath.

90
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,320
Here is the first one.

91
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,580
Tokidok Dispotential Sponsors.

92
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,880
Wait, I've heard of this game.

93
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,860
But like, I also don't remember, because it was like 2011.

94
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,960
Yeah, yeah, it's a zombie game.

95
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,320
I remember.

96
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,380
It was like a mod.

97
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,430
Yeah, it's like super... Oh!

98
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,460
Oh my god, are we bringing all the old zombie games?

99
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,360
All the old zombie mods?

100
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,680
Which one was the other one?

101
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,040
The other two.

102
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,460
Are we bringing them back?

103
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,100
Is it zombie games again?

104
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,480
Are we ditching space games and going back to zombies?

105
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,300
Yes!

106
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,420
Bring back DayZ!

107
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,040
Bring back DayZ 2!

108
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,200
Zombie meta!

109
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,720
Bring back zombie meta!

110
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,400
Permadeath.

111
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,500
Come full circle!

112
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,300
What was the other one?

113
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,320
There was like another one.

114
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,560
There's the other zombie mod.

115
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,400
Oh yeah, Arma!

116
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,720
Bring back Arma 2!

117
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,960
Early access Halloween 2024.

118
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,600
Oh my god, we're bringing it back!

119
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,440
We're bringing back zombies!

120
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,700
To introduce our next game, please join me in welcoming someone who I've known for over a decade.

121
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:13,280
She's been a huge fan of some of our reveals like Street Fighter 6 a few years ago, and of course Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth last year when she was sitting in the audience.

122
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,140
Well this year, she's joining us on stage.

123
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,100
H1Z1, yeah!

124
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,080
Bring back H1Z1!

125
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,480
Bring back DayZ!

126
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:25,700
Bring back H1Z1, DayZ, and every zombie game out there.

127
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,400
Thank you, Jeff!

128
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,860
Hi everyone, I am so excited to be here at Summer Game Fest.

129
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,180
Mushi!

130
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:36,060
I'm here with you today to share some even more super fun trailers.

131
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,200
So, let's get straight to another world premiere.

132
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,280
Yeah, I heard that Jeff said that we shouldn't be too hyped for Summer Game Fest.

133
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,640
Because, like, there's not a lot of games being developed.

134
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:50,300
Because, they won't say it, but a lot of people got fired.

135
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,820
He didn't say why!

136
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,440
Why there's not a lot of games being released this year!

137
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,260
But I'll say it.

138
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,160
There were a lot of layouts.

139
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,400
Yeah, Jeff.

140
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,820
Why is there not a lot of keys being released, Jeff?

141
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,600
Why does the graphics look like shit?

142
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,640
I'm sorry.

143
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:35,540
But, like, is this a mobile game?

144
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,240
Is this a mobile game?

145
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,980
Quidditch Champions...

146
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,220
There's no way this is a PC game.

147
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,600
This is on PlayStation?

148
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:55,100
Guys, this looks so good...

149
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,180
Bro, okay, but imagine playing this on a PlayStation 5.

150
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,520
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

151
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,020
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

152
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,080
Oh, the polygons.

153
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,520
This is the next gen.

154
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,580
What the fuck?

155
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,420
What?

156
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,980
Guys, it's okay.

157
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,500
You're gonna make us stronger by watching...

158
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,780
What the...

159
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:47,730
What is this?

160
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:50,830
What?

161
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,830
Oh my god, he dropped the soap.

162
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,210
I was like, what?

163
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,570
Guys, guys, they're making us stronger.

164
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,850
So like, they're like lowering our expectations.

165
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,470
In the beginning.

166
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,070
So that, by the time...

167
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,510
Like, you know, near the end.

168
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,610
Like, we'll take anything.

169
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,390
This is what they're doing.

170
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,510
This is exactly what they're doing.

171
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,110
I can feel it.

172
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,510
Oh yeah, this is definitely gonna be a VTuber game.

173
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:24,650
This is like a streamer bait game, 100%.

174
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,750
This is not for the regular players.

175
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,610
This is for streamers only.

176
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,290
There's no way.

177
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,570
Like, I'm confused looking at this.

178
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:40,570
But I know it's gonna be a...

179
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,050
Just a fun streamer game.

180
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,650
New flavor of the month, yeah.

181
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,740
What the?

182
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,520
I'm just...

183
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,340
I'm just confused.

184
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,200
The helicopter has been stolen?

185
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,760
What?

186
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,580
But...

187
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,680
Your fucking fellow prisoners can blow you up?

188
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,300
What?

189
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,280
Just so you know...

190
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,540
The Summer Game Fest is sponsored, by the way.

191
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,880
So this is endorsed by...

192
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,200
This is endorsed by Jeff.

193
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,900
Oh, I can tell.

194
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,740
I can...

195
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,380
I can tell.

196
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,860
From Ubisoft and Lucasfilm Games.

197
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,680
The first open-world Star Wars game where you live the life of a scoundrel.

198
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:50,840
On Monday at 12pm Pacific, you'll get to see a full gameplay showcase during Ubisoft's third event.

199
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,940
I was surprised they let that final shot be in the trailer.

200
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,880
For, you know...

201
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,820
We've got an exclusive new glimpse at the game.

202
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,380
I'm pretty...

203
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,260
For like people who are watching this.

204
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,600
Like, you know...

205
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,220
And then like having a sponsor sponsor this watch-a-long.

206
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,880
Or like this Summer Game Fest.

207
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,320
I was very surprised it showed.

208
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:19,980
Especially when, you know, some game companies that are sponsoring this might not be based in America.

209
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,580
That might have very tough rules regarding stuff like that.

210
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,980
I was so confused.

211
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,150
Is this Ubisoft?

212
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,130
Tune in.

213
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,930
August 30th.

214
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,190
Oh, it's not EA.

215
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:52,090
If it was EA, I could be like, can I have early access?

216
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,530
There's so many people in the audience!

217
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,470
I hope they get to watch for free.

218
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:05,810
I hope they don't have to pay for a ticket.

219
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:09,830
I had a chance to play through this next game and I have to say, it is really spectacular.

220
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,010
Neva comes from Nomada Studio.

221
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:14,610
The creators of the Game Award winning game, Grease.

222
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,590
It chronicles the story of Alba...

223
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,970
Yeah, like we're watching for free.

224
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,570
They have to sit next to all the other gamers.

225
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,490
...at the gameplay.

226
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,210
And like, still watch a screen.

227
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,370
We're all looking at the same screen.

228
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,350
I don't understand.

229
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,680
God, I hope they didn't have to pay to like sit there.

230
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,740
Oh, that's true.

231
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,300
They might get small gift bags and then like sell it on eBay.

232
00:14:51,320 --> 00:15:01,500
You know how like Blizzard like give like those gifts where like if you work for the dev team for like an X amount of years, you get gifted like special items.

233
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,300
And then like you can find majority of those items on eBay.

234
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:14,340
Yeah, it's an actual thing and then they put and then they sell it on eBay.

235
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,880
You can find like majority.

236
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,100
Like it's supposed to be like if you work in Blizzard for like 10 years, you get like a sword or something.

237
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,580
And then like somebody put that sword on eBay.

238
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,980
Yeah, if you get five, you also get those items.

239
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:43,850
Looks really pretty.

240
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,750
It looks really pretty and it looks like a game that I won't be playing.

241
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,030
But others will enjoy it.

242
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:57,850
You guys can be like, it looks so pretty but I know some of you guys won't even play it.

243
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,270
...tons of fun to play.

244
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:05,010
And there's much more coming later today in the Devolver Direct, which will air directly after the Day of the Devs on this same stream.

245
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:05,990
So we got lots more for you.

246
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,750
I'm never gonna play that.

247
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,410
Right next, it's time for our next game announcement.

248
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,380
What's this?

249
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,720
Guys, they're lowering our expectations.

250
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,240
So like they're actual, they're like really good games.

251
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,080
Might not be that impressive when we have our expectations high.

252
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,620
But now that our expectations are so low.

253
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,460
Like we'll be like, whoa!

254
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,660
Is this Civ?

255
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,320
It looks like Civ.

256
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,860
Wait, is it?

257
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,040
Oh my god, see?

258
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:47,980
It's working!

259
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,760
People are going crazy right now!

260
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,840
I knew it!

261
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,960
It's working!

262
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,940
It's already working!

263
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,200
People are already going crazy!

264
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,820
It's already working!

265
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,200
Civ, you did it again!

266
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,080
I mean, it has to be Civ.

267
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,840
There's a rocket now.

268
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,340
Civ 7!

269
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,000
2025.

270
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:28,920
Jesus.

271
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,220
2025.

272
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,660
Oh my god, he's so old!

273
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,400
Someone put him in a home?

274
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:39,860
I'm sorry.

275
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,100
Sorry.

276
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,600
I'm sorry.

277
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,020
It's like a grandpa!

278
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,080
Double down, Toki!

279
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,980
I'm just saying, like, we gotta get some new blood in here.

280
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,840
And we hope you'll join us later this summer.

281
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,760
I didn't realize...

282
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,840
Okay, okay, I'm gonna be truthful for you guys.

283
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,920
In the meantime...

284
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,120
I didn't even think he was alive.

285
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,060
I'm sorry.

286
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,200
I legitimately thought he...

287
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,420
Like, I thought the game was so old.

288
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,800
I legitimately thought he wasn't alive anymore.

289
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,210
Oh my god, is this Wukong?

290
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,750
Oh my god, is this Dead Souls Wukong?

291
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:35,430
In the Black Mists!

292
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,460
Okay, but, like, you gotta admit, I'm pretty sure, like, Cid is, like, just like a...

293
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,740
What is the word called?

294
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,620
He's just there to be, like, a figurehead.

295
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,100
Like, just to be the face of the company.

296
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,040
I'm pretty sure he's not actually making the...

297
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,160
The new decisions anymore for the newer Civ games.

298
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,220
Only because I feel like...

299
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,620
Since it's like...

300
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,320
Um...

301
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,080
You know, it's like...

302
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,120
You gotta get in new blood.

303
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,220
But they still...

304
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,500
They're like, oh my god, it's Cid!

305
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,680
You know it's gonna be good because Cid is still endorsing it.

306
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,940
God, it looks so good.

307
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,460
Too bad this is just all cinematics and not gameplay trailers.

308
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:19,600
Okay.

309
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,740
Okay, I'm, like, a little bit conflicted.

310
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,700
Because they're only showing cinematics.

311
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,440
And it's releasing in August.

312
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,760
But they're still showing cinematics.

313
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:32,740
So, like, that's the only thing that I'm really concerned about.

314
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:38,760
Like...

315
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,100
That's like...

316
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:45,160
You know, if you don't have gameplay trailers and it's releasing in August...

317
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,640
I'm concerned.

318
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,130
It looks pretty.

319
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,210
The cinematics looks pretty.

320
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,450
Is this a VR game?

321
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,630
Oh my god, it's like that...

322
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,890
Is this a VR game?

323
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,070
Oh my god, it was...

324
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,090
Yeah, it was like that.

325
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,070
Aliens VR trailer.

326
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:13,350
And everybody was like, what the fuck is the frame rate?

327
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:22,610
Yeah, I know they showed gameplay trailers in the past.

328
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:27,490
But the fact that we aren't showing more gameplay trailers at this stage is concerning.

329
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:33,430
Because cinematics, it should be something that's shown, like, when there's, like, you know, a year before released or something.

330
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,690
But at this point, when there's still a few...

331
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:36,530
Like, there's, like, less...

332
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:37,990
Like, around two to three months.

333
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:38,790
Until release day.

334
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,370
It should just be gameplay trailers.

335
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:52,570
What's this?

336
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:53,970
Oh, I remember!

337
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:54,670
I remember!

338
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,370
There was an early access of this.

339
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:57,990
There...

340
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:58,310
It was...

341
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:58,970
It's some, like...

342
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:00,090
Spooky game.

343
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:01,690
Spooky shooter...

344
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:02,430
Looter shooter game.

345
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:03,990
Yeah.

346
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,070
July 9th?

347
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:07,490
I just heard, like, barely anything.

348
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,270
Yeah, one is human.

349
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:10,490
This...

350
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:11,550
This had an early access.

351
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,630
I'm pretty sure.

352
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,510
I remember seeing people play...

353
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,070
Playing it.

354
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,230
And I was like,

355
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:33,220
oh, I don't know.

356
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,000
Oh, hey, turnip!

357
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,300
Boy!

358
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,770
Have any of you faced Tyranids before?

359
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,850
Only these past two days.

360
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,870
Then there is much to learn.

361
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:48,870
I can't wait for this one.

362
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:49,610
Space Marine?

363
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,390
Space Marine looks so good.

364
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:55,230
It reminds me of Gears of War.

365
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,650
That's why I think it's going to be really good.

366
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:01,490
Because it looks so similar to Gears of War.

367
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:03,890
And I think it's going to be really good.

368
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,530
I feel like it's gonna be like a spiritual successor.

369
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:14,070
I mean like Warhammer's been around for a while, but like, I mean like gameplay wise, it can be sort of like a spiritual successor to Gears of War.

370
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,890
All right, welcome back to Summer Game Fest.

371
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:21,770
We've got some amazing developer guests joining us throughout the show, and I'm very excited to introduce our first guests.

372
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:27,790
They are legendary creators who are working on a brand new fantasy RPG metaphor slated to launch this October.

373
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:35,530
Please welcome the director and art designer of Persona 3, 4, and 5, Katsura Hashino and Shigemori Sojima.

374
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:36,430
Oh shit.

375
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:40,450
I like how somebody was like, Persona.

376
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,950
And then someone was like, Ohmaga Kojumbo.

377
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,950
Guys, wrong company.

378
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,990
Guys, not everybody that wears glasses is Kojumbo.

379
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:58,650
Thank you everybody.

380
00:22:58,870 --> 00:22:59,910
It is a pleasure to be here.

381
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:03,170
I know he's wearing glasses and has a similar haircut.

382
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,730
It's a pleasure to be here with Mr. Sojima.

383
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:24,510
This game is a RPG in which party members- An arPEgE?!

384
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,450
No way.

385
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:30,150
these archetypes allow you to fight against- Oh my god.

386
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,230
An arPG?

387
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:31,230
An arPG.

388
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:31,770
An RPG?

389
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,110
No fucking way.

390
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:43,090
Alice is making an RPG?

391
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,050
Archetypes are the embodiment of power born from the will to face your fears and anxieties.

392
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:01,650
Breaking the mold.

393
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:04,170
Slow down there, Atlas.

394
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:06,610
We don't want too much innovation in a minute.

395
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,650
What is going on?

396
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:12,030
In total, there will be more than 40 types of archetypes available in the game.

397
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:14,990
These archetypes can gain experience and even evolve.

398
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:17,010
Some of them can evolve into stronger versions.

399
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,730
Alice, make it an FPS game.

400
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:26,590
Do it.

401
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:28,910
Do I know balls?

402
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:43,450
So we are pouring all of our acquired expertise into this game to make it as exciting as possible.

403
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:48,470
In fact, we've even brought our latest trailer today, which is centered around the topic of these archetypes.

404
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:50,810
Thank you very much, and we hope you enjoy it.

405
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,790
Isn't archetypes basically Persona?

406
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:56,810
But like, oh my god, Persona boy!

407
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:58,910
Oh, it's a helm.

408
00:24:59,030 --> 00:24:59,770
Oh my god!

409
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,950
It's Persona boy!

410
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:03,890
In Persona 3!

411
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:08,810
Yeah, Persona 3 boy!

412
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:12,710
Sorry, Archetype boy.

413
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:20,790
Bro,

414
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:38,990
it's literally Persona 3 boy!

415
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:43,190
He actually just looks like him!

416
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:47,010
He just has, like, two different eye colors.

417
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:50,850
You must acquire more archetypes and bring them together.

418
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,070
So, like...

419
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:53,990
How's this?

420
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:55,250
Scour!

421
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,940
No holding back!

422
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,880
Why can't I just make Persona 7?

423
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,640
Now you've acquired a most interesting power.

424
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,880
An archetype whose existence was only theoretical.

425
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,380
You wield power now.

426
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,080
Yeah, it's fantasy Persona.

427
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,040
Sorry, Persona... I lost.

428
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,700
This is Persona 7.

429
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,580
They skipped 6.

430
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,020
Let's see.

431
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:22,620
Metaphor.

432
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,320
I'm surprised I could read that.

433
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,960
Such an honor to have Hashino and Tsujima with us on stage.

434
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,800
I mean, it's gonna be good, I'm pretty sure.

435
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:40,560
Like, Atlas cannot really fuck up the, like, the formula regarding Persona.

436
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,360
They just took Persona and, like, changed the name a little bit.

437
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,860
As Batman, you face a new threat.

438
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,780
The mysterious Rat King and his cultish devotees.

439
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,480
There's no way!

440
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,360
I don't think they've ever made a bad Persona game.

441
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,560
That's, like, RPG.

442
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:01,040
I know they've made bad Persona games that aren't RPG games.

443
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:06,020
But, like, I meant, like, I don't think they've actually made a bad Persona game.

444
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:10,280
There's a new darkness overtaking Gotham.

445
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,600
Leap Persona Dash Alone!

446
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:25,640
You're, like, one out of the ten people that actually played that game.

447
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,420
Yeah!

448
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:49,370
Oh, hey, Batman.

449
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:54,090
Wait, is this a VR game?

450
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:56,510
Arkham Shadow.

451
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,530
Only on MetaQuest 3.

452
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,110
Bro!

453
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:01,850
Stop letting Facebook buy you off!

454
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:10,230
Stop taking Facebook money!

455
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,410
Who the fuck owns it?

456
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,520
The Valve 3D thing.

457
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:26,500
If MetaQuest keeps fucking getting all the exclusives.

458
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,220
I'm looking forward to heading back to the Arkhamverse.

459
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:32,940
Now, it is time to update fans on a legendary fighting game franchise.

460
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,500
And that includes me.

461
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:41,840
Because I have been a fan of this series ever since one of its first iteration and have been playing each one ever since.

462
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,860
So, let's check it out.

463
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:44,840
Wait, what is this?

464
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,520
What the fuck is this?

465
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,920
Is this Street Fighter?

466
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,300
He has this...

467
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,760
What the fuck is he doing?

468
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,760
Wait, is this Street Fighter?

469
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,210
Terry.

470
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:16,710
I recognize the shirt and pants only because...

471
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:21,390
From like Street Fighter...

472
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:23,870
What is it?

473
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,730
Marvel versus...

474
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,710
Marvel versus Capcom?

475
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:51,940
Bison is alive?

476
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:57,280
I don't know any of the...

477
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,320
I feel like fighting game lore is like...

478
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,280
So complicated.

479
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,960
I'm really surprised people can't keep up with it.

480
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:17,320
Oh, so they're adding new characters into Street Fighter.

481
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,180
Wait, Terry was not in Street Fighter?

482
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,440
I thought Terry was like very...

483
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,140
I thought Terry was like...

484
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,020
OG.

485
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,480
Oh, Terry is from SNK.

486
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:32,820
What?

487
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,200
Wait.

488
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,400
Terry's not in Street Fighter?

489
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,480
Wait, why do I remember Terry?

490
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:39,520
Wait, why do I remember Terry?

491
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:39,780
Terry.

492
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,860
Why the fuck do I remember Terry?

493
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,900
Oh, SNK versus Capcom.

494
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:50,360
Oh.

495
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,400
No, it wasn't from Smash.

496
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,140
I remember the 2D Terry.

497
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,600
See, I'm not the only one.

498
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,080
Fads also thought Terry was Street Fighter.

499
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,120
No, I remember like the 2D guy.

500
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,700
Like, when he was like 2D.

501
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:21,950
What is this?

502
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:26,710
Okay, you know what's funny?

503
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,290
Super chats are on for the...

504
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:31,470
For the Summer Game Fest stream.

505
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:34,010
And people are actually super chatting it.

506
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,370
And I'm like, why?

507
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:42,190
I don't think the money's gonna go to the developers.

508
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:43,450
Like, yeah.

509
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:46,490
Yeah, people are super chatting the stream.

510
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:47,830
But like...

511
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,530
It's not gonna go to the developers.

512
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,590
Just for chat.

513
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,210
Oh shit, Goku.

514
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,650
Is this a new Dragon Ball Z fighting game?

515
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,260
It's like going to a...

516
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,200
To like, I guess, Jeff?

517
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,740
Cause he's getting sponsored to show...

518
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,860
Getting paid and sponsored to show trailers?

519
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:15,620
I mean, I think it's...

520
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,840
Just like I see that.

521
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:17,780
One

522
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,880
way to save her.

523
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,020
The graphics look ass.

524
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:34,680
I'm sorry.

525
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,620
True.

526
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,780
Are you blind?

527
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,460
I've seen better graphics for Dragon Ball Z.

528
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,640
In older games.

529
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:58,420
I feel like the older Dragon Ball Z games had better graphics.

530
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:05,330
Like, Sad Land had...

531
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:07,150
Okay, Sad Land...

532
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:08,380
Had better graphics.

533
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:10,010
And it's the same style.

534
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:15,570
You can't...

535
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:16,930
You can't say that.

536
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,530
We're literally playing Sad Land.

537
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:19,390
There you go, internet.

538
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:21,350
We got two release dates for fucking zero October 11th.

539
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:21,370
And it's the same style.

540
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:23,410
And the graphics are so good.

541
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:26,410
Now we step in the world of Delta Force Hawk Ops.

542
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:29,870
A free to play tactical shooter available to play on all platforms.

543
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:33,710
Here's a look at their multiplayer FPS extraction mode.

544
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:36,950
Sad Land is on...

545
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,470
Sad Land's still 3D.

546
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:39,670
We've got a new mission.

547
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:40,110
We've got a new mission.

548
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:41,530
It's the new Tarkov.

549
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:41,770
The new Tarkov.

550
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:42,890
The situation is zero damage.

551
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:47,390
The conflict is escalating between Havangor and Al-Sarra Guard.

552
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:49,450
It's time to take action.

553
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:50,950
Objection.

554
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:55,470
Collect and decode the Mandelbrot located at the tourist center on the southeast region.

555
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,470
We need to utilize Tarrace and splendid search...

556
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,390
Why are they bad things?

557
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:01,130
Like, why are there so many boring extractions?

558
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:02,890
It's because extraction shooter...

559
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:09,330
It's because they heard Tarkov is like going up in flames, so they're all trying to make the new Tarkov.

560
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,110
Quick recovery, quick recovery.

561
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:20,590
Because like they saw the hole in the... they saw the hole in the system so they're trying to make a new Tarkov to grab the Tarkov players.

562
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:25,290
Because the only extraction shooters people are playing is only Tarkov.

563
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:30,170
So everybody's just trying to make the next Tarkov.

564
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,380
This looks like Payday.

565
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:45,560
It's an extraction shooter so it could be... it's like a mix of Call of Duty and like extraction shooter.

566
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:51,460
I mean remember when Tom Clancy made an extraction shooter and how fast that died?

567
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:59,160
I'm very pessimistic because like we've had like a two or three years of sort of low-key bad games.

568
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,620
Like from AAA.

569
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,280
From AAA titles.

570
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,920
From AAA companies.

571
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:24,120
We've had like, you know, we had like two or three years of like bad AAA game titles.

572
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:42,390
All right.

573
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:42,750
All right.

574
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:45,110
Educate me on the Dragon Ball Z game.

575
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:45,910
The new game.

576
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:49,370
People were so like surprised I said that.

577
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:53,630
I just thought the graphics looked like...

578
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:58,810
like I've seen better Dragon Ball Z graphics for other games.

579
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:04,510
So I was just like, man, does it look just so TK?

580
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:11,690
We have seen it on stream.

581
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:21,620
And now I have an update for you on Fatal Fury City of the Wolves.

582
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,820
Oh, is it a remake?

583
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,700
Is that a remake of the game?

584
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,180
That's the Budokai style?

585
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,480
Oh, it's a... it's a sequel.

586
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:34,540
Oh.

587
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,400
Oh, wait, is this in the Street Fighter?

588
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,680
Is it time for more Terry?

589
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,300
It's Terry!

590
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,340
It's SNK!

591
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,200
What does SNK sound for?

592
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,560
I just said it because everybody else was saying it.

593
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,540
It's the Terry game!

594
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,860
So far,啦.

595
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,720
Oh, it's the

596
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:20,790
name of the company.

597
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:21,670
I knew that.

598
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:24,570
Oh wait, I know this!

599
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:26,110
I remember the minigames.

600
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,500
Wait, what's this?

601
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,080
Is this a VR game?

602
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,580
Is this a VR game but for a meta?

603
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,720
Exclusive in meta?

604
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,900
Love more in... what?

605
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,140
Oh, is this a sponsor?

606
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,180
A new standard.

607
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:00,760
OLEDs.

608
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,260
Oh, it's for monitors.

609
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,520
Hey guys, you wanna know what monitors I have?

610
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,440
So instead of buying this...

611
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,440
People calling this an ad when this entire... That's true.

612
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,540
This entire convention...

613
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:30,220
This entire watch-along is an ad for Jeff.

614
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,420
But then they added an ad within an ad.

615
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,100
You know they paid to be in there.

616
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,860
What is this?

617
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,570
What the heck is this?

618
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,690
Sorry, what the hell is this?

619
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:54,850
I'm not playing Minecraft anymore.

620
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:59,650
Is this a mobile game?

621
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,240
The Final Battle?

622
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,380
Oh, this is a mobile game.

623
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,580
Mobile gamers watch...

624
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,700
Summer Game Fest?

625
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,380
They watch...

626
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:41,110
My mom is not watching April.

627
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:42,170
Hey, grandpa!

628
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:47,970
Give me mod on your channel.

629
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:58,250
You first.

630
00:39:58,310 --> 00:39:59,250
You mod me first.

631
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,540
What's this?

632
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,500
It's a mecha game, but what is it?

633
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,080
Guys, I know it's a mecha game.

634
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,920
I may be stupid, but I can still see.

635
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,440
I was like, what is this game?

636
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:31,840
And so my chat was like, it's a mecha game, Toki.

637
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:34,080
Like, I know it's a mecha game.

638
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,340
Close beta test coming in.

639
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:39,960
Mecha...

640
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,300
Oh, wow.

641
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:40,680
Look.

642
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,100
Mecha Break.

643
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,160
We're back here at Summer Game Fest.

644
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:46,900
Is that new IP?

645
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,620
Look at Mecha Break with its immersive aerial and ground combat with lightning fast maneuvers.

646
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,100
Next, Jason Blum...

647
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,820
Is this a mecha battle royale?

648
00:40:55,260 --> 00:41:01,160
... with incredible horror films over the years, like Get Out, Megan, and last year's Five Nights at Freddy's.

649
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:04,060
Well, now Blumhouse is entering the video game world.

650
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,480
I never heard of it.

651
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:10,040
I hope it doesn't fail like that Gundam one.

652
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,540
That's sad.

653
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:14,360
That Gundam one could have been a really good game.

654
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:20,040
I'm so sad that it actually got shut down.

655
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:30,480
I feel like if they invested more into perfecting it, or like patches and stuff...

656
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,420
What is this?

657
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:33,980
Wait.

658
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:34,260
What?

659
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,500
Why is it pixels?

660
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,320
What is it?

661
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:43,400
What?

662
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,430
Oh, are these like...

663
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:52,110
... worse Freddy?

664
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,310
Oh, they're different games!

665
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,590
Sleep Awake from Iso.

666
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:01,310
I thought it was all one game.

667
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:02,570
I was so surprised.

668
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,310
Don't worry, Viv.

669
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:06,350
I was like...

670
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:09,530
How did it go from 3D to Horror Stardew Valley?

671
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:14,910
I was like...

672
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:17,290
What is this style joke?

673
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:20,410
It's several games.

674
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:24,330
This looks like a different game.

675
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:29,370
Should have some developer mode.

676
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:31,530
I was like...

677
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:35,590
How did we go from shooting dolls to Horror Stardew Valley?

678
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:39,210
It depicts the farming.

679
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:49,470
It was not clear to me in the beginning until it like...

680
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:51,670
Gave a different game title.

681
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:56,370
Blumhouse Games.

682
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:58,070
Oh, it all came from one studio.

683
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:00,710
Wait, they're releasing all of that?

684
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:04,530
Oh, that's a lot of games that they're releasing.

685
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:05,810
I hope one of them is good.

686
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:06,410
Okay.

687
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:07,230
Okay.

688
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:10,230
Is it?

689
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:13,270
Please welcome Jason Blum, CEO and founder of Blumhouse.

690
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:13,910
Yeah, that's a lot.

691
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:16,070
And he's playing creatively at Blumhouse Games.

692
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:18,730
Yeah, isn't Blumhouse a fucking movie studio?

693
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:20,950
When did they start...

694
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,100
When did they start making games?

695
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,240
We got ourselves a full slate there.

696
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,040
That's incredible.

697
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,040
So, Jason, tell us a bit about...

698
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,380
Why did you want to get into games like this?

699
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:34,920
What are we doing?

700
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:37,660
Well, we've been very, very busy.

701
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:39,880
I'm very happy to be here.

702
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:40,140
Thank you.

703
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:40,960
Thank you for having us.

704
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:41,860
Thank you guys all.

705
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:43,500
Great to hear the fans out there.

706
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,060
Oh, they're publisher.

707
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,660
Oh, they just...

708
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:46,520
They funded.

709
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:47,440
Oh, I see.

710
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:48,340
They published them.

711
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:54,040
You'll all be very happy to know we're working at this very minute on the sequel of Five Nights at Freddy's.

712
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:54,560
It's coming.

713
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:56,700
Don't worry.

714
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,360
Yeah, I was like, didn't they make FNAF?

715
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,640
Anyway, horror is...

716
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,580
They make the FNAF movie?

717
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:03,000
...to my great relief.

718
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,500
It's getting more and more popular.

719
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:05,700
Our movies are working.

720
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,780
It's working on streaming.

721
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:08,320
It's working in live events.

722
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,320
Well, you hope they're working.

723
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,120
We wanted to try and make it happen.

724
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:15,200
We wanted to try and take our approach to movies and apply it to games.

725
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,820
And that's what you see here.

726
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,560
We're going to do independent games.

727
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:31,700
We're going to look for creators and give them a platform and encourage these creators to be weird and subversive and find the most FNAF scary things they can and put them into really cool games.

728
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:32,600
It's like a...

729
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,080
What is it?

730
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:33,920
A shotgun tactic.

731
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,380
They look great.

732
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:36,360
It's really fun.

733
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,500
As many indie horror games as they can.

734
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:38,780
Tell us a bit about it.

735
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:39,280
We saw a bunch of games.

736
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:40,980
It will be the next FNAF.

737
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:46,700
Well, as you just saw from our slate, our horror games are a lot like Blumhouse movies.

738
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:51,320
They come in many different flavors of fear, which means there's a horror game for everyone.

739
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:57,660
So maybe you're a fan of nostalgic, 90s, 90s, a bit more intense, first-person shooters.

740
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:02,000
I don't think that's as big of a compliment as you think it is.

741
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:07,000
Because I think FNAF was one of their...

742
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,800
As horror fans, one of their...

743
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,720
Was like their most popular.

744
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:20,660
And our independent development partners are the same, and they're just as excited, which means we've got psychological nightmares, we have supernatural scares, we have cosmic horror.

745
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:26,160
And our team has worked really hard to work with global, creative, talented partners.

746
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:29,300
And that means for us that we...

747
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,480
Oh wait, they did get out?

748
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:32,500
Okay.

749
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,040
Let me see it there.

750
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:36,120
Blumhouse.

751
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:36,140
Blumhouse.

752
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:37,140
Yeah.

753
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:37,260
Blumhouse.

754
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:38,840
Which means that we can take risks.

755
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:39,500
They did Megan.

756
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:40,440
We can be flexible.

757
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,180
The breakdancing doll.

758
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:42,860
And maybe we can push the limits of what's possible.

759
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:44,680
Do you guys remember Megan?

760
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:45,060
We're so excited.

761
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:45,700
Yeah.

762
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,360
The breakdancing doll.

763
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,680
It looks awesome, all the stuff you have there.

764
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:53,600
I know we'll get into when games are coming out, but some of these are coming soon, Jason, right?

765
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,240
We've got a good slate.

766
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:54,500
Well, yeah.

767
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:56,400
We're on PC and console.

768
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,440
And we wanted to start with not just one, but we wanted to start with a few games.

769
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:04,800
For those who don't know, Megan was in the YouTube trailers, it was horror film.

770
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:06,980
Fear the Spotlight is a fresh release.

771
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:07,120
Yeah.

772
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:13,360
The message was that the theme for it was obviously the horror film.

773
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:17,300
But Megan was honestly more so of a comedy film than a horror film.

774
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,560
Because she just starts fucking breakdancing.

775
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:22,400
It's like, yeah, it's a horror comedy.

776
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:26,660
But the movie trailers were all super serious.

777
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:28,800
But then when you watch the film, she starts breakdancing.

778
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:33,000
Well, I know this is just the start, so we'll probably be seeing you in future years with more from Live Long House Games.

779
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:33,960
You guys, what do you think of the slate?

780
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:34,840
Pretty amazing, right?

781
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,100
The YouTube trailers made it look like a really bad movie.

782
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,240
It's a fucking scary film.

783
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,400
Thank you, guys.

784
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,300
All right.

785
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,520
You guys never seen the breakdancing dog?

786
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:47,000
And now here's the world premiere of a brand new Power Rangers game with a retro film.

787
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:47,540
Wait, what?

788
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,560
A Power Rangers game?

789
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:55,670
They made Tooth Fairy?

790
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:05,270
Wait, all they do is make horror films.

791
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:08,810
They are the shotgun tactic.

792
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:13,150
Because they have some really bad horror films.

793
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:13,750
Oh my God.

794
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:14,150
Oh my God.

795
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:19,570
They've made some really bad horror films, too.

796
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:26,610
Oh, it's like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game.

797
00:47:27,950 --> 00:47:28,970
Oh my God.

798
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:32,490
It's like the Teenage Mutant Ninja one.

799
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:35,130
Go go Power Rangers.

800
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:04,050
Gotta miss that theme song.

801
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:10,450
I think my favorite Power Ranger series was the animal one.

802
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:12,830
That one I was super obsessed with.

803
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:14,590
What's this?

804
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:15,770
Is her mom dead?

805
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:19,210
Oh my god, her mom's dead.

806
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:20,350
It's just like Bambi.

807
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:38,740
Oh my god, it's so cute!

808
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:42,000
It's so cute!

809
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:46,680
I'm never gonna play it, but it looks so cute!

810
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,760
Hey guys, thank you for the donation!

811
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:58,700
Thank you, thank you!

812
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,300
Wait, what the fuck?

813
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,600
Oh my god, he's growing up like Simba!

814
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,460
How many years has it been?

815
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,600
Oh my god, it's like spirited away!

816
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,700
Wait, no, is it spirited away?

817
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:28,820
No, princess is spirited away!

818
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:28,820
No, princess is spirited away!

819
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:28,820
No, princess is spirited away!

820
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:29,380
Princess Mononoko!

821
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:32,520
Yeah, it's like Princess Mononoke!

822
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:36,080
Deer and Boy.

823
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,600
I love the name.

824
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,020
It's very direct.

825
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:42,940
Yeah, I was like, wait, it's not spirited away, it's the other animal one.

826
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:51,240
Oh my god, he did this by himself?

827
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:53,080
Oh, okay.

828
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:58,000
That's funny.

829
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:03,300
I'm sorry, I thought it was funny that the French government funded this.

830
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:06,480
Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is arriving later this year.

831
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:10,400
This is a first person open world action RPG from Warhorse Studios.

832
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,240
Sponsored by France!

833
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,460
Thanks, France!

834
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:22,840
The best laid plans of men don't always come to fruition.

835
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,680
Man proposes.

836
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:28,900
What's this?

837
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:30,740
God disposals.

838
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:35,600
And then boots you right in the balls.

839
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:40,680
These two young fellows, I need to find them.

840
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:47,040
One's a smart ass smith, and the other's a blue blooded fledgling.

841
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,660
You behave like a spoiled boy!

842
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:50,040
What's this?

843
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:52,020
Kingdom Come 2?

844
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:52,740
Kingdom Come 2?

845
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:53,420
Gah...

846
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,660
Gentlemen, praise me to the king.

847
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:00,480
Oh my god, there's horses!

848
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:01,820
I'm sold.

849
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:05,420
What the fu- Okay.

850
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:11,160
This is the moment where people rewind on that specific moment.

851
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:16,900
You know on like YouTube, there's like, uh, where do people replay the section of a video?

852
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:22,280
I bet you if they publish this trailer on YouTube, it will hit- it will be that part.

853
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,060
The bonus replay!

854
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:32,160
With the Kingdom Come trailer.

855
00:51:56,370 --> 00:51:58,190
Kingdom Come 2!

856
00:51:59,230 --> 00:51:59,790
Deliverance!

857
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:02,030
Oh, 2024!

858
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:03,350
It's not that long.

859
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:05,970
I've never played the first one.

860
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:06,710
No, of course not.

861
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:08,230
Did you play the first one?

862
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:10,150
No, but I'm just a sheep.

863
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:13,770
Back in 2021, we announced his new game, Slitherhead, at the Game Awards.

864
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:15,910
I'm excited because you guys are excited.

865
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:21,050
I'm a blank slate that you can put your excitement on.

866
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,400
What game is this Slitherhead made?

867
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:45,950
Wait, what's- what's Slitherhead?

868
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:48,810
Oh, it's Silent Hill?

869
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:50,650
Director Silent Hill?

870
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:51,070
Oh!

871
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:53,990
Okay, that actually freaked me out.

872
00:52:54,210 --> 00:53:04,690
Wait, is this based off of- Is this based off of- I don't want to say it because I'm scared I'm wrong.

873
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:10,390
But like, this is- Is this Hong Kong?

874
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:11,590
Is

875
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:19,190
this Hong Kong?

876
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:20,030
Yeah, is this Hong Kong?

877
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:27,840
Yeah, is this Hong Kong?

878
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:31,190
I saw- I saw red taxis.

879
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:35,200
What the fuck?

880
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:40,520
Yeah, no, this is Hong Kong!

881
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,020
The bus!

882
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:41,960
The green bus!

883
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,140
Wait, I think it is!

884
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,560
I saw the green bus!

885
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:48,720
The minibus!

886
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:57,180
Okay, I'm going to play it because it's based off of Hong Kong.

887
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:59,160
What the fuck is that?

888
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:07,160
I thought it was like- I don't want to say it because if it's not, I'd be very embarrassed.

889
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:11,100
I thought it was like- I don't want to say it because if it's not, I'd be very embarrassed.

890
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:15,040
I'm not scared of like horror games if you can shoot it.

891
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,840
Okay, that's a lie because Dead Space fucked me up too.

892
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:22,220
But like, when you can like kill things, it's like less scary.

893
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:27,280
Oh my god, I can be a dog?

894
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:29,960
An evil dog.

895
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:36,660
Wait, this game looks actually sick.

896
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:38,520
Oh my god, the best game of the year!

897
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,500
Game of- Oh, I knew it.

898
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:46,400
I toughened through every other trailer so I can finally be happy when I see this.

899
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,520
This is it, guys.

900
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:51,560
This is it.

901
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,820
We watched all those other trailers.

902
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,880
So we can finally get to here.

903
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,080
This is what we've waited for.

904
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:06,100
Finally a game that's game of the year.

905
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:08,980
Nidaveh, thank you for the 100 videos!

906
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:09,940
Thank you, thank you!

907
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:13,340
Thank you, thank you!

908
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:21,680
Okay, but the transition between the fucking spooky, scary Slitherhead game to Killer Bean like, I got the whiplash!

909
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:26,540
Fucking whiplash!

910
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:32,760
It's like Slitherhead, creators of Silent Hill.

911
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:34,800
Anyway, here's Killer Bean.

912
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,260
Well, it is sure nice to meet you.

913
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:47,540
Before you die.

914
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:49,860
What the fuck?

915
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:55,840
Oh my god, look, they have asses!

916
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,240
Oh my god, it's already perfect.

917
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:00,760
It's already perfect.

918
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:14,740
Oh my god.

919
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:16,680
They made me who I am.

920
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:18,500
Okay, those water graphics.

921
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,560
You can pay for it.

922
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:25,980
Those water gra- What the fuck is the logo?

923
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:29,480
Glad you liked that one.

924
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:36,980
That was Killer Bean, a third-person roguelike shooter made by another single developer, believe it or not, right here in Los Angeles.

925
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,180
I mean, I'm not- okay.

926
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:44,200
I'm not surprised because Killer Bean, the movie, was also made by a single developer.

927
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:47,400
Or single uh, animator.

928
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,940
I mean, I'm not surprised.

929
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:55,360
Guys, Killer Bean's a roguelike.

930
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:56,440
We have to buy it.

931
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:57,620
Hello, Jeff, everyone.

932
00:56:57,980 --> 00:56:59,560
I'm very happy to be here.

933
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,600
When we created our studio, Aymeric and I, we promised each other to always come up with something new.

934
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,000
Wait, guys, we can make Killer Bean win the Steam Awards.

935
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:09,880
Because it's a popular vote.

936
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:14,760
Guys, we have to unite together for the Killer Bean to win an award.

937
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,080
in this position to mount K2.

938
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:22,540
But half of this team didn't come back.

939
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:28,440
And I've always wondered why do alpinists risk their lives in such extreme conditions.

940
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:32,540
This is something we wanted to explore in Cairn.

941
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:38,000
Cairn is a game about what it takes to go beyond your limits.

942
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:39,020
Cairn?

943
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:42,420
You climb a mountain to reach a summit never reached before.

944
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,840
And the climbing gameplay is a challenge.

945
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:47,420
Wait, it's a climbing game?

946
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:51,280
A difficult game about climbing but like RTX on?

947
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:56,920
And what you're going to see in the trailer is not from cutscenes.

948
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:59,680
It's the actual climbing gameplay.

949
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:05,200
You can see more later today during Day of the Devs.

950
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:06,280
But now let's have a look.

951
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:07,560
Getting over it too?

952
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,240
The Game Bakers.

953
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:13,940
Wait, it is!

954
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:15,040
Wait!

955
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:19,720
It is a difficult game about climbing but like RTX on!

956
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:24,100
But this time he's wearing clothes!

957
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:25,720
But this time he's wearing clothes!

958
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,160
But this time he's wearing clothes!

959
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:28,560
But this time he's wearing clothes!

960
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:31,020
Oh my god, this is actually anxiety inducing.

961
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:33,980
Okay, I was going to say we have to look at...

962
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:38,920
He has clothes and hair!

963
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:40,560
Oh my god, they grow up so fast!

964
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:43,620
Oh my god, and he was actually a she!

965
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:48,980
Oh my god, she's shaking.

966
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:49,060
Oh my god, she's shaking.

967
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:01,860
What the fuck?

968
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:13,860
It's like super atmospheric.

969
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,920
But people are going to make a speed run out of this.

970
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:18,420
But people are going to make a speed run out of this.

971
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:23,480
You're going to see like the speed run of this, she'll just be like jumping.

972
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:30,120
Like it looks so intense for the speed run of this game.

973
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,940
It looks so like...

974
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,540
It looks so dumb for the speed run.

975
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:35,940
For the speed run.

976
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:50,300
Oh!

977
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:51,760
That's Stanley Parable.

978
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:53,520
Wait, what?

979
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:54,980
Another walking simulator?

980
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:08,520
Wait, they're making a farm game?

981
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:12,440
What?

982
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:14,720
What?

983
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:16,520
What?

984
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:17,280
What?

985
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,480
Where's my British narrator?

986
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:28,680
Fiery Bros, we won!

987
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:35,040
I'll usually check in with Borel, the guy who owns the shop, to see if my help was needed anywhere.

988
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:38,180
Wait, is this a farm game?

989
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:38,740
There's chicken.

990
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:39,140
Chicken!

991
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:39,880
Sorry.

992
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:43,520
Copyright distinct free chicken.

993
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,100
Copyright free chicken.

994
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,080
What?

995
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:10,080
Huh?

996
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:12,660
What the f...

997
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:14,380
Bro, she has trauma.

998
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:16,540
What?

999
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:19,040
She has PTSD.

1000
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,140
What the fuck happened?

1001
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:25,880
Is this not a farm game?

1002
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:29,580
I thought... I thought farm game was supposed to be relaxing.

1003
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:36,060
Stress farm game?

1004
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:39,700
Haha.

1005
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:46,280
This does not look relaxing now.

1006
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,960
And I!

1007
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:03,320
I do.

1008
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:05,840
What's this?

1009
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:10,880
These are incredible.

1010
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,460
They call themselves the Sahin.

1011
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:18,040
Nine among them were chosen and shielded from death.

1012
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,300
The unknown nine.

1013
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:22,280
Does this have anything to do with why Vincent is here?

1014
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:24,100
What is this?

1015
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:28,140
Humanity has lived for eons at the mercy of the nine.

1016
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:32,220
It's time we took control of our own destiny.

1017
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:43,820
Why are you so interested in Vincent?

1018
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:44,840
Is this Forsaken?

1019
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:45,640
Give us someone I loved.

1020
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:51,460
Oh my god, the bad guy is British.

1021
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:54,300
Find your target and bridge the gap.

1022
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:55,900
You don't belong here.

1023
01:02:56,180 --> 01:02:56,860
You're wrong.

1024
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,800
This is exactly where I'm meant to be.

1025
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:00,220
Classic.

1026
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,280
God, I hope.

1027
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:11,740
Unknown nine.

1028
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:12,420
Oh, it's...

1029
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:13,560
It's a new IP.

1030
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,120
The fort is a strange place.

1031
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:17,020
Unknown nine awakening.

1032
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:18,360
It's a new IP.

1033
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:20,980
Right?

1034
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:22,360
I don't know.

1035
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:24,100
It would be really sad if it's not a new IP.

1036
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:25,180
Hey!

1037
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,680
How about we see the world together?

1038
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:31,990
I finally found something that I want to protect.

1039
01:03:32,450 --> 01:03:33,910
I'll steal your heart.

1040
01:03:34,630 --> 01:03:35,590
Adventure starts.

1041
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:38,350
Monster Hunter Stories.

1042
01:03:39,890 --> 01:03:41,850
You know what I wish was...

1043
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:44,310
I wish they'd bring to PC?

1044
01:03:44,830 --> 01:03:48,290
That one Monster Hunter game where it was just the cats.

1045
01:03:51,530 --> 01:03:54,450
I wish they'd just release a Monster Hunter game where...

1046
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:56,110
Like, re-release that PC...

1047
01:03:56,110 --> 01:03:58,350
That game to PC where it's just the cats.

1048
01:03:59,550 --> 01:04:00,870
That shit was fire.

1049
01:04:03,050 --> 01:04:03,590
Yeah.

1050
01:04:03,830 --> 01:04:05,290
The village was...

1051
01:04:05,830 --> 01:04:07,250
I don't want to play the humans.

1052
01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:09,190
I want to play the fucking cats.

1053
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:17,840
That...

1054
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:18,560
That...

1055
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:19,480
That...

1056
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:20,320
That...

1057
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:21,140
That...

1058
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:23,080
That...

1059
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:26,280
Wait, who said that in my chat?

1060
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:27,200
Bro!

1061
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,940
That's a broken fan right there.

1062
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:35,820
That fan is...

1063
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:41,720
He goes in there with zero expectation.

1064
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:49,920
On guard.

1065
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:54,160
Your greatest...

1066
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:55,320
Fun.

1067
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:02,460
Wait, is this Colin?

1068
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:06,880
Is this Conquistador?

1069
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:08,280
Dark Souls?

1070
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:08,940
No way.

1071
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:19,880
Spanish Soul.

1072
01:05:27,740 --> 01:05:29,340
Oh my god, they have guns!

1073
01:05:33,590 --> 01:05:34,350
The fuck?

1074
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,340
Where is but one certainty in the cosmos?

1075
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:49,000
Change.

1076
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:51,320
Wait, it is.

1077
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:52,260
Wait a minute.

1078
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:52,840
It is...

1079
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:54,920
Wait, it is Conquistador Souls.

1080
01:05:58,140 --> 01:05:59,620
That's so interesting.

1081
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:03,440
Oh my god.

1082
01:06:03,620 --> 01:06:05,220
It actually is.

1083
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:09,340
Oh, it's Italian.

1084
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:13,360
I thought it was the Spanish Inquisition.

1085
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:17,420
Is it Italian Souls instead of...

1086
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:19,940
Wait, but I thought it was the Spanish Inquisition.

1087
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:22,620
Was it not?

1088
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:25,540
Was it the Italian?

1089
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:27,220
The Italians had it.

1090
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:39,350
Is this Anthem?

1091
01:06:46,290 --> 01:06:49,270
I like how people are debating if it's Spanish or Italian.

1092
01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:51,050
But the developers were Italian.

1093
01:06:51,350 --> 01:06:53,290
But then I thought it was the Spanish Inquisition.

1094
01:06:53,850 --> 01:06:55,370
So it's not the Spanish Inquisition?

1095
01:06:56,750 --> 01:06:57,290
Oh,

1096
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:01,580
it's not.

1097
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:02,520
It is Italian.

1098
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:06,880
It's Italian!

1099
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,680
It was Italian all along.

1100
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:21,020
It literally says the game is called, guys.

1101
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:22,380
Yeah, but like...

1102
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:27,100
We're all Jokey Bird fans and none of us fucking can read or listen.

1103
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:32,640
It has to be like put in our face.

1104
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:35,380
But the game is called.

1105
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:42,220
We need them to repeat it like three to four times.

1106
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:50,820
I like how they're like, don't lump us in with you, but then everybody above him and below him are like, true!

1107
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,640
July 2, 2024.

1108
01:08:23,940 --> 01:08:25,500
Oh, the first descendant.

1109
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:25,780
Awesome.

1110
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:29,940
The first descendant will be available across PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam.

1111
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,520
I mean, I like the bunny helmet.

1112
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:33,300
Prepare for the release on July 2.

1113
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:34,920
Let's hope it's not like the anthem.

1114
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:41,220
And now, please welcome two developers whose hit indie game, Among Us, took the world by storm and a couple of game awards.

1115
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:42,940
Wait, they're gonna make a new game?

1116
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:43,660
New IP?

1117
01:08:43,860 --> 01:08:46,700
From Innerslock, here are Victoria Tran and Forrest Willard.

1118
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:48,540
New IP?

1119
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:51,520
Among Us 2!

1120
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:57,020
Among Us 2!

1121
01:08:57,140 --> 01:08:57,960
What's up, gamers?

1122
01:08:58,340 --> 01:08:59,720
We want the sequel!

1123
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:04,900
Can you believe they just let us be on this stage?

1124
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:05,860
In 3D!

1125
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:07,060
In 3D!

1126
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:08,500
Can we announce something totally fake?

1127
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:10,040
Do you think they'll let us do that?

1128
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:10,980
Among Us 2?

1129
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:11,640
Among Us 3?

1130
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:13,800
Oh my god, Among Us 2!

1131
01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:19,220
Turns out we actually have something very real we wanted to present to you all today.

1132
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:23,260
There's been so many great indie games in recent years.

1133
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:25,020
Among Us 2, Among Us, Among Us are here.

1134
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:28,400
It's no secret that it's kind of a rough time in the industry.

1135
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:32,880
Some devs don't really get the chance they deserve, so we thought we could help out a little bit.

1136
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:36,540
That's why we're excited to announce our side project, Outer Sloth.

1137
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:43,540
An indie game fund we made that offers the kind of deals we would have wanted back in our less popular Among E days.

1138
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:54,000
This is our way of saying thank you to our crewmates, players, peers, by helping some games and devs have the funding and freedom needed to ship their games.

1139
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:54,360
Publisher.

1140
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:57,460
And then we all get to play them, which was the real plan.

1141
01:09:57,460 --> 01:10:02,060
Or like a publisher, but like they don't, they're just giving money away for free.

1142
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:06,120
Outer Sloth is our passion project and dream for a better, more sustainable industry.

1143
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:07,840
We are really excited.

1144
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:08,360
Yeah, Jeff!

1145
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,800
Why are we getting games anymore?

1146
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:14,440
To reveal it here and show you the current line up of games we managed to find.

1147
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:15,240
What's going on?

1148
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:16,520
Say it out loud!

1149
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:21,340
And don't worry Jeff, it has your favorite, a ton of world premieres.

1150
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:22,160
Enjoy!

1151
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:31,890
I can't remember the last time I played it.

1152
01:10:31,990 --> 01:10:33,030
I'm so sorry!

1153
01:10:33,110 --> 01:10:33,130
Hi,

1154
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:46,200
I'm Iain from Shapeshop, and you may already be playing our first game, Mars First Logistics.

1155
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:49,100
Oh my god, you get to build your own Mars Rover!

1156
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:55,020
We are Trinket Studios, creators of Battle Chef Brigade, and this is our card battler RPG, Ases.

1157
01:10:56,020 --> 01:11:03,360
We are Studio Any% and we're making the Marsfield Archives, a game about building Oh wait, I remember Battleship.

1158
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:09,040
Wait,

1159
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:15,540
that's like my type of game.

1160
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:17,900
I just have to press one button.

1161
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:23,400
I don't have to make up this excuse being like I forgot how to play the game anymore.

1162
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:36,640
Hi, I'm Eka, creative director of Outerloop Games, makers of Thirsty Suitors, and Falcon Age.

1163
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:42,740
In our new game, explore the world in an upgradable mech and cook up tasty dishes for local communities.

1164
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:48,980
Fight off corpos, discover new DOSA recipes, and reunite with your strange loved ones for one last meal.

1165
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:53,760
Project DOSA is a game about life, death, love, and food for the soul.

1166
01:11:56,220 --> 01:11:58,860
I wonder why they really hate corporations.

1167
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:02,200
Jeff!

1168
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:07,940
Those all look fantastic and I cannot wait to play them.

1169
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:10,480
I wonder if he got laid off somewhere.

1170
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:14,880
Did you know that there's going to be an Among Us TV show?

1171
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,160
Oh yeah!

1172
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:19,540
Yeah, Randy's gonna be in it.

1173
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:20,800
There's going to be an Among Us TV show.

1174
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:22,800
Check out this sneak peek.

1175
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:25,640
Oh yeah.

1176
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:28,880
Some of the fucking craziest voice acting.

1177
01:12:29,620 --> 01:12:30,500
Voice actors.

1178
01:12:32,980 --> 01:12:37,020
Bro, some of the craziest high profile voice actors are in there.

1179
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:37,520
Some of the craziest high profile voice actors are in there.

1180
01:12:53,070 --> 01:12:54,790
There's a goth Among Us?

1181
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:57,450
This is a fucking lie!

1182
01:12:58,050 --> 01:12:59,510
Where are my goth cosmetics?

1183
01:13:11,170 --> 01:13:13,590
Yeah, Patton Oswalt, Elijah Wood.

1184
01:13:13,790 --> 01:13:14,850
Yeah, Randall Park.

1185
01:13:15,230 --> 01:13:17,130
Elijah Wood is in it, guys.

1186
01:13:19,950 --> 01:13:23,470
Up next, we have Sonic X Shadow Generations.

1187
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:27,810
Give him a gun!

1188
01:13:28,210 --> 01:13:32,970
A definitive greatest hit collection of 3D and 2D levels from Sonic and Shadow's history.

1189
01:13:33,130 --> 01:13:33,470
A definitive greatest hit collection of 3D and 2D levels from Sonic and Shadow's history.

1190
01:13:33,470 --> 01:13:34,570
Don't be a coward!

1191
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:35,790
Now it's time for the glimpse of Shadow's brand new powers.

1192
01:13:35,790 --> 01:13:36,710
Give him a gun!

1193
01:13:37,030 --> 01:13:38,710
And gameplay from the standalone campaign.

1194
01:13:39,090 --> 01:13:42,490
As well as the official release date announcement.

1195
01:13:43,130 --> 01:13:43,550
As well as the official release date announcement.

1196
01:13:47,150 --> 01:13:49,470
No, why would Shado... Sonic?

1197
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:51,010
No, I'm talking about fucking Shadow!

1198
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:51,270
Shadow!

1199
01:13:51,790 --> 01:13:53,150
It's already canon!

1200
01:13:53,530 --> 01:13:54,830
Just let him have his gun!

1201
01:14:06,950 --> 01:14:09,210
Let Shadow say fuck!

1202
01:14:11,510 --> 01:14:13,790
I mean, it would be part of his character.

1203
01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:22,540
Oh shit, Metal Sonic?

1204
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:26,000
Oh, goodbye Metal Sonic.

1205
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:26,880
That was fast.

1206
01:14:39,710 --> 01:14:40,450
No gun.

1207
01:14:44,510 --> 01:14:49,010
If Shadow doesn't have a gun, how can we tell who's Sonic and who's Shadow?

1208
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:50,810
What the fuck?

1209
01:14:50,830 --> 01:14:51,910
He has venom?

1210
01:14:57,990 --> 01:14:59,110
Woah, what?

1211
01:15:00,270 --> 01:15:01,590
What the fuck is that?

1212
01:15:01,810 --> 01:15:04,230
What was that Sonic skin on the left?

1213
01:15:04,690 --> 01:15:08,170
Shadow the symbiote.

1214
01:15:12,490 --> 01:15:13,330
Oh, dude!

1215
01:15:16,450 --> 01:15:19,310
Lady Jessica conceives a child.

1216
01:15:20,330 --> 01:15:21,270
She banged.

1217
01:15:24,070 --> 01:15:26,550
Yeah, I was gonna say, who the fuck is Terios?

1218
01:15:29,050 --> 01:15:31,390
It was Shadow's original design?

1219
01:15:31,870 --> 01:15:33,830
He was gonna be called Terios?

1220
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:48,100
Until it created me.

1221
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:53,940
But I see a narrow way.

1222
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:56,340
A path that might have been.

1223
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:03,480
What if my mother had obeyed her orders and given birth to a girl?

1224
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:07,230
How do you obey that?

1225
01:16:07,370 --> 01:16:08,110
You can't just...

1226
01:16:10,710 --> 01:16:14,810
I will now give birth to a girl.

1227
01:16:16,570 --> 01:16:19,490
How's Atreides surviving the Battle of Arrakeen?

1228
01:16:20,630 --> 01:16:21,910
She chose?

1229
01:16:23,430 --> 01:16:25,290
Oh, in Dune you can.

1230
01:16:25,650 --> 01:16:26,930
Oh, okay.

1231
01:16:27,550 --> 01:16:29,130
No, I've never seen Dune.

1232
01:16:29,230 --> 01:16:31,530
The only thing I knew about Dune was the fucking...

1233
01:16:32,510 --> 01:16:34,210
The popcorn holder.

1234
01:16:35,230 --> 01:16:36,490
I didn't know that.

1235
01:16:39,070 --> 01:16:41,730
I just know about the popcorn holder in Dune.

1236
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:43,530
Lisan al-Ghaib.

1237
01:16:43,570 --> 01:16:45,950
So I was like, how the fuck did she choose?

1238
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:50,530
All of my visions lead to horror.

1239
01:16:52,430 --> 01:16:53,970
Except for this one.

1240
01:16:55,410 --> 01:16:57,910
This one leads to you.

1241
01:17:02,070 --> 01:17:03,230
Dune Awakening.

1242
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:14,480
More Dune Awakening coming at Gamescom ONL in August.

1243
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:16,220
Now it is time to see the announcement.

1244
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:19,860
of another new game from a brand new development studio.

1245
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:20,400
Oh.

1246
01:17:22,540 --> 01:17:23,480
Lightspeed Studios.

1247
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:24,320
Ooh.

1248
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:26,480
I like the animation already.

1249
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:33,500
That's really, really good.

1250
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:37,140
You guys hear that studio that made...

1251
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:42,620
Evangelion is about for bankruptcy and closing down their studios?

1252
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:45,740
Because of tax fraud?

1253
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:49,400
Yeah.

1254
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:54,680
I was like, because of tax fraud.

1255
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:56,580
I was like, yeah.

1256
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:57,880
Okay.

1257
01:17:58,180 --> 01:17:58,900
Wow.

1258
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:01,140
Yeah.

1259
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:04,100
That's crazy.

1260
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:06,480
I did not realize.

1261
01:18:15,660 --> 01:18:16,460
Yeah.

1262
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:17,340
The...

1263
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:18,600
What was it?

1264
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:19,280
Was it the CEO?

1265
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:22,840
Like the CEO and somebody else in the company...

1266
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:24,540
Committed tax fraud?

1267
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:26,460
Actually...

1268
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:27,220
Look...

1269
01:18:27,220 --> 01:18:29,380
Here is the David Kim from Uncapped Games.

1270
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:30,800
Thanks, Jeff.

1271
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:35,700
So Battle Aces is the RTS game for everyone.

1272
01:18:35,860 --> 01:18:39,460
It's for players that are brand new to RTS as well as RTS games.

1273
01:18:39,460 --> 01:18:39,720
Oh, my God!

1274
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:41,180
An RTS game?

1275
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:42,460
We really want to bring the core form of RTS to everybody.

1276
01:18:42,460 --> 01:18:43,720
I thought it went extinct?

1277
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:45,940
Holy shit.

1278
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:49,400
Oh, my God!

1279
01:18:57,380 --> 01:19:01,040
I was so surprised this was an RTS game.

1280
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:04,300
RTS is 2024.

1281
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:06,260
What a year.

1282
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:24,800
Give me Zerg class!

1283
01:19:25,660 --> 01:19:27,940
Nobody wants to play as Robots.

1284
01:19:28,020 --> 01:19:30,640
Okay, maybe I like Robots, but like...

1285
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:34,880
But like, people need different types of classes.

1286
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:40,900
I wanna play as Robots.

1287
01:19:43,180 --> 01:19:44,880
Give us Robot Zerg!

1288
01:19:45,340 --> 01:19:45,600
Haha.

1289
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:45,860
Haha.

1290
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:50,840
I can't lie, I wanna play as a Robot.

1291
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:54,000
Thank you, David!

1292
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:55,080
That was fantastic!

1293
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:56,520
Make them sexy!

1294
01:19:56,740 --> 01:20:08,140
Our next premiere unveils the exciting new destination for a game that shadow-dropped at the Game Awards last year, the Finals, with its unparalleled destruction, wrapping the world's most deadly game show.

1295
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:16,240
Now, after dozens of updates and two seasons, we're unveiling where contestants will be going in the all-new season starting next week on June 13th.

1296
01:20:16,580 --> 01:20:17,880
Sharpen your katanas!

1297
01:20:18,020 --> 01:20:19,280
And welcome to...

1298
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:21,100
Season 3 of the Finals.

1299
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:23,200
She's so real for that.

1300
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,300
If they hit that reset button...

1301
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:29,640
I am so surprised they're making an RTS in 2024.

1302
01:20:30,380 --> 01:20:32,000
I thought they went extinct.

1303
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:35,040
Is this the Finals?

1304
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:36,840
It's still alive?

1305
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:40,440
Oh my god, you can play as a sushi chef?

1306
01:20:42,980 --> 01:20:43,880
Wait, what?

1307
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,320
Okay, guess who...

1308
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:49,040
Bro, one has guns!

1309
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:50,960
The other has swords!

1310
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:52,140
Like...

1311
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:54,780
Sorry, but like...

1312
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:57,940
Bro, what is a wooden bow gonna do?

1313
01:21:02,180 --> 01:21:04,480
The one is winning.

1314
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:08,460
Bro, he has a...

1315
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:09,480
It's a...

1316
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:11,120
What the fuck?

1317
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:12,300
Okay, nevermind.

1318
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:15,400
The ninja proved me wrong.

1319
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:17,420
Holy shit.

1320
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:19,480
Okay, I...

1321
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:20,980
Okay, they're not rude.

1322
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:23,440
The ninja proved...

1323
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:25,520
Oh my god, he went full ninja.

1324
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:26,600
The Finals in Kyoto.

1325
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:27,600
And Genji deflects.

1326
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:27,820
Alright.

1327
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:33,840
Please welcome multiple Game Awards winner and a dazzling Game Awards performer, if I do say so myself.

1328
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:35,740
Sam Lake from Gravity!

1329
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:38,380
Bro, gamers get hungry.

1330
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:41,100
I can't believe it.

1331
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:42,560
What the fuck?

1332
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:44,100
Oh, Alan Wake too.

1333
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:44,580
Oh, it's him!

1334
01:21:45,380 --> 01:21:46,980
It's the Alan Wake guy!

1335
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:53,300
I think that's enough.

1336
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:54,300
Thank you.

1337
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:55,260
It's him!

1338
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:55,820
Hi.

1339
01:21:56,380 --> 01:21:59,880
You see, this is now the only way...

1340
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:00,960
Alan Wake in my lake.

1341
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:04,660
...they let me come on stage to tell you something exciting.

1342
01:22:04,740 --> 01:22:05,580
Alan Wake 3?

1343
01:22:05,740 --> 01:22:06,640
News about Alan Wake 2.

1344
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:16,500
Many of you have been posting your Remedy Game collection pictures on your shows.

1345
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:23,260
With Alan Wake 2, so far, digital only, sadly missing.

1346
01:22:23,780 --> 01:22:28,000
Well, we are excited to announce...

1347
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:28,900
Max Payne?

1348
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:30,820
...physical deluxe editions...

1349
01:22:32,180 --> 01:22:35,770
...and physical collector's editions...

1350
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:38,000
Physical copies?

1351
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:39,540
...for Alan Wake 2, coming this fall.

1352
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:43,420
You can lock in your copy starting tomorrow.

1353
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:44,700
I don't have a disc.

1354
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:46,480
Who the fuck has a disc?

1355
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:48,440
Who has a disc holder on their PC anymore?

1356
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:51,480
...some expansion content for Alan Wake 2.

1357
01:22:51,740 --> 01:22:52,260
Right?

1358
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:56,360
I'm thrilled to introduce you all to...

1359
01:22:56,360 --> 01:22:56,520
Me?

1360
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,420
...nice things.

1361
01:22:57,420 --> 01:22:57,660
Me?

1362
01:22:58,250 --> 01:23:00,320
That's not a cup holder?

1363
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:08,800
It contains three episodes with three familiar, fan-favorite, playable characters...

1364
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,540
Okay, there are consoles.

1365
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:11,640
...in mysterious, terrifying, and quirky...

1366
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:13,680
I can't wait to play in 60 frames, guys.

1367
01:23:13,820 --> 01:23:14,360
...and quirky.

1368
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:16,420
...what-if scenarios.

1369
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:22,480
It was a chance for us to really go out there...

1370
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:25,200
...as if we already didn't.

1371
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:29,660
Night Springs will be playable...

1372
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:32,360
Now?

1373
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:34,500
...in less than 24 hours.

1374
01:23:34,740 --> 01:23:35,300
Oh, okay.

1375
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:36,520
Tomorrow.

1376
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:39,500
Thank you.

1377
01:23:39,780 --> 01:23:41,020
I mean, that's pretty fast.

1378
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:41,620
Is it free?

1379
01:23:41,740 --> 01:23:43,360
Now, with this world premiere...

1380
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:48,360
...I invite you to step into...

1381
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:49,800
...Night Springs.

1382
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:50,740
Is it free?

1383
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:55,600
Night Springs.

1384
01:23:56,140 --> 01:23:57,500
A special place.

1385
01:23:57,620 --> 01:23:59,000
A shifting space.

1386
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:02,640
Existing in a countless number of parallel realities.

1387
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:06,660
Different every time we set upon the road that leads us there.

1388
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:09,080
It's free after I buy it.

1389
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:09,760
That's so true.

1390
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:19,160
Yeah, I haven't owned a physical copy of video games in a very long time.

1391
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:23,360
My PC does not have a cup holder in, like, years.

1392
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:25,380
And I will come back for you.

1393
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:27,560
Well, thank you for the tier one sub.

1394
01:24:27,620 --> 01:24:28,560
Thank you, thank you.

1395
01:24:28,620 --> 01:24:31,160
Yeah, I just buy digital copies of stuff now.

1396
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:33,620
Because they don't do...

1397
01:24:33,620 --> 01:24:35,900
They don't do the cool game manuals anymore.

1398
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:38,280
I was the only one who could save the writer...

1399
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:40,160
...and the very soul of murder.

1400
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:41,540
Oh my god, the waitress?

1401
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:45,780
Oh, you can play as other characters now?

1402
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:49,120
I mean, in Outwake 2 you can too, but, like...

1403
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:50,840
But, like, character...

1404
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:52,240
You can play as the waitress?

1405
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:08,380
Exclusive to Deluxe...

1406
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:10,640
You need the Deluxe Edition?!

1407
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:16,310
Through the endless time...

1408
01:25:16,580 --> 01:25:17,160
Did you see that?

1409
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:18,780
It's so... It was so tiny.

1410
01:25:19,890 --> 01:25:22,340
Did you... Did you see me?

1411
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:24,760
Did you see the text?

1412
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:26,560
It was so tiny too.

1413
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:29,720
It was, like, exclusive to Deluxe Edition.

1414
01:25:30,540 --> 01:25:34,520
A beautiful paradise.

1415
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:39,180
Where primal forces clash.

1416
01:25:41,690 --> 01:25:43,680
The island's deepest...

1417
01:25:44,060 --> 01:25:44,560
...secrets.

1418
01:25:46,260 --> 01:25:48,960
Where ancient mysteries awaken.

1419
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:54,180
Guys, I can only read when I want to know if it's free or not.

1420
01:25:58,340 --> 01:26:00,780
That's the only time I can read.

1421
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:05,760
This...

1422
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:08,040
...is eternal.

1423
01:26:11,060 --> 01:26:12,660
Did you guys know that...

1424
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:15,460
...Amazon games...

1425
01:26:15,460 --> 01:26:17,000
Netflix has games as well?

1426
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:18,400
That's right.

1427
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:24,680
New World Aeternum will launch on PS5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC on October 15th.

1428
01:26:24,740 --> 01:26:29,740
And now you can play the game start to finish as a solo player, or play co-op and use cross-play as well.

1429
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:40,280
If you're watching SGM on TikTok Live right now, you can comment HSR in the chat to claim your special in-game bundle for Honkai Star Rail of Stellar Jade from TikTok Game Rewards.

1430
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:41,120
Cool.

1431
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:42,520
TikTok Game Awards?

1432
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:47,460
Bro, that's gonna...

1433
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:52,560
Guys, we gotta get this TikTok sponsored before it's shut down in January.

1434
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:58,140
...featuring a beloved character who is clearly ready for the forthcoming journey with her brand new look.

1435
01:27:01,210 --> 01:27:02,130
Oh my god.

1436
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:07,530
One of my staff in my team was like, you should...

1437
01:27:08,590 --> 01:27:10,510
...you should make an Instagram...

1438
01:27:10,510 --> 01:27:13,530
...and start uploading your TikTok videos to Instagram.

1439
01:27:13,850 --> 01:27:17,530
Because, like, we don't know if TikTok's still gonna be here after January.

1440
01:27:22,670 --> 01:27:25,730
She was like, I think it'd be a good idea.

1441
01:27:29,690 --> 01:27:34,790
Just so, like, you know, if they ban TikTok, like, you don't just lose everything.

1442
01:27:37,690 --> 01:27:38,850
You're Canadian, though.

1443
01:27:38,890 --> 01:27:39,470
That should be fair.

1444
01:27:39,470 --> 01:27:42,150
Yeah, but a lot of my fans are American!

1445
01:27:48,570 --> 01:27:51,270
Isn't Instagram gonna steal your content for their AI?

1446
01:27:51,730 --> 01:27:55,710
Every company has already downloaded my fucking image.

1447
01:27:57,210 --> 01:28:00,450
If Google hasn't done it yet, then, like, it's fine.

1448
01:28:02,530 --> 01:28:04,830
Why do people choose to swear?

1449
01:28:08,060 --> 01:28:09,660
Because in the end...

1450
01:28:20,170 --> 01:28:21,210
...what's happening?

1451
01:28:21,350 --> 01:28:21,710
Gacha.

1452
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,780
It's Hong Kong Star Rail.

1453
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:33,220
It's just Gacha.

1454
01:28:40,650 --> 01:28:45,190
That's why, like, Gacha sponsors, they pay so much money to sponsor you.

1455
01:28:45,830 --> 01:28:47,930
Dark and Darker is still...

1456
01:28:48,810 --> 01:28:49,450
...alive?

1457
01:28:51,190 --> 01:28:53,390
Oh, the reason why Gacha games...

1458
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:56,290
...pay a lot to sponsor you...

1459
01:28:56,290 --> 01:28:58,030
...is it's been alive.

1460
01:28:58,030 --> 01:29:02,650
Bro, guys, Dark and Darker, you can play Dark and Darker whenever still.

1461
01:29:04,350 --> 01:29:04,790
Like...

1462
01:29:06,730 --> 01:29:08,750
Oh, it got back on Steam?

1463
01:29:09,450 --> 01:29:12,970
Okay, I'm just saying, because, like, Dark and Darker died so fast...

1464
01:29:12,970 --> 01:29:15,030
...because they, uh...

1465
01:29:16,010 --> 01:29:21,110
...uh, from what Surefour told me, they, like, removed a lot of stuff in there that made it fun.

1466
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,900
So I don't know if they add it back in.

1467
01:29:28,220 --> 01:29:30,240
Yeah, the game balance was really bad.

1468
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:32,340
And that's why it got, like...

1469
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:34,500
...like, people stopped playing it.

1470
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,360
What the fuck?

1471
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:44,360
So I don't know if they added the fun...

1472
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:45,920
OH MY GOD, YOU CAN BE A BEAR!

1473
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:48,160
Nevermind, everything...

1474
01:29:48,160 --> 01:29:48,680
...nevermind.

1475
01:29:48,940 --> 01:29:49,540
It's back.

1476
01:29:49,660 --> 01:29:50,200
It's back.

1477
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:51,340
Dark and Darker is back.

1478
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:53,880
That is...

1479
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:58,140
The funnest game is saved.

1480
01:29:58,660 --> 01:30:00,220
We're so back, boys!

1481
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:02,320
The game is saved!

1482
01:30:04,220 --> 01:30:08,640
There you have it, the unforgiving fantasy FPS dungeon PvP...

1483
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:09,700
We're so back.

1484
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:15,600
...the adventure Dark and Darker is now live on both Steam and Epic Games Store today.

1485
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:17,100
So play it this weekend, alright?

1486
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:18,300
Oh my god.

1487
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:20,860
Alright, next week we're playing Dark and Darker.

1488
01:30:21,020 --> 01:30:22,600
I'm gonna be a fucking bear.

1489
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:26,640
We're gonna bring it to our VIP section thanks to the Discover Orange...

1490
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:28,140
Why is there nobody sitting there?

1491
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:31,080
Discover, you don't have to be a VIP to be treated like one.

1492
01:30:31,340 --> 01:30:33,640
Alright, now here's the announcement of the release date...

1493
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:37,280
...for Capcom's upcoming Kunitsugami Path of the Goddess.

1494
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:40,180
The empty...

1495
01:30:40,180 --> 01:30:41,480
Those are our seats.

1496
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:44,540
Why is there an empty row of seats?

1497
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:49,960
Wait, what was I talking about before I saw the bear?

1498
01:30:51,940 --> 01:30:53,220
Before I saw the bear...

1499
01:30:53,220 --> 01:30:54,400
...I started talking about...

1500
01:30:55,220 --> 01:30:56,820
...the Dark and Darker shit.

1501
01:31:01,620 --> 01:31:03,620
Capcom is giving something.

1502
01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:06,000
Oh yeah, Gatcha.

1503
01:31:06,020 --> 01:31:08,600
Alright, Gatcha pays a lot for sponsors...

1504
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:11,500
...cause all they need is to hook one person.

1505
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:12,960
Really.

1506
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:17,140
The moment they hook one person into a Gatcha game...

1507
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:20,180
...like, they already made back the money for the sponsor.

1508
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:26,440
Yeah, as long as one person is a whale...

1509
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:27,240
...like...

1510
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:29,680
...that's so real.

1511
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:35,660
That's all they need.

1512
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:09,100
What's this?

1513
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:12,260
Is this Risco Rain?

1514
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:14,080
It feels like Risco Rain.

1515
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Hyper Light?

1516
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,320
What's Hyper Light?

1517
01:32:30,450 --> 01:32:31,450
Risco Rain 3.

1518
01:32:31,670 --> 01:32:33,770
We added another co-op player.

1519
01:32:34,950 --> 01:32:36,090
Hyper Light.

1520
01:32:36,270 --> 01:32:36,810
Hyper Light.

1521
01:32:37,950 --> 01:32:39,270
It is Hyper Light.

1522
01:32:39,690 --> 01:32:41,450
No way that's Hyper Light.

1523
01:32:41,510 --> 01:32:42,290
I will cream.

1524
01:32:44,370 --> 01:32:45,090
Alright.

1525
01:32:47,510 --> 01:32:48,370
Come on.

1526
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:18,680
Don't expose him like that.

1527
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:20,540
Don't expose him like that.

1528
01:33:21,820 --> 01:33:22,660
Don't expose him like that.

1529
01:33:22,660 --> 01:33:23,480
Peta hates this game.

1530
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:25,140
Peta hates everything.

1531
01:33:26,660 --> 01:33:28,820
You can't say that.

1532
01:33:29,740 --> 01:33:30,480
Peta...

1533
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:32,680
Peta hates everything.

1534
01:33:40,340 --> 01:33:43,160
Peta's whole strategy is to hate...

1535
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:44,400
...and cause like...

1536
01:33:44,870 --> 01:33:46,420
...like, cause like controversy...

1537
01:33:46,420 --> 01:33:47,780
...cause they're in the internet.

1538
01:33:48,060 --> 01:33:50,400
Wait, it's that guy from SNL that got fired.

1539
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:54,920
It's time to dispel any of these completely unfounded rumors...

1540
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:55,920
Wait, unless it's not him.

1541
01:33:56,060 --> 01:33:58,660
He looks like one of the SNL guys that got fired.

1542
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:03,020
...and the city of San Vanserdam have never been better.

1543
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:04,760
Things are going great here.

1544
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:06,220
We have absolutely nothing to hide from the citizens.

1545
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:06,560
Not him?

1546
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:07,600
Wait, who is he?

1547
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:09,820
Everybody here at...

1548
01:34:09,820 --> 01:34:10,520
Who is this guy?

1549
01:34:10,820 --> 01:34:11,760
...loves this town?

1550
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:13,660
We think this town rules.

1551
01:34:14,700 --> 01:34:16,860
Why would we hurt a town that rules?

1552
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:18,860
This is Tim Robinson?

1553
01:34:19,220 --> 01:34:20,380
I can't stop thinking about how you're saying we're selling...

1554
01:34:20,380 --> 01:34:21,520
...the city for scraps.

1555
01:34:21,820 --> 01:34:22,960
That makes me sick.

1556
01:34:23,140 --> 01:34:26,380
That makes my whole family sick to their stomachs.

1557
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:29,460
My wife hasn't been on the toilet for weeks.

1558
01:34:29,740 --> 01:34:31,280
He is the SNL guy!

1559
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:32,880
Because of what you say about what M-Corp is doing to this town.

1560
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:33,640
All those lies.

1561
01:34:33,780 --> 01:34:34,520
Wait, unless...

1562
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:37,520
Everyone at M-Corp is really good.

1563
01:34:37,820 --> 01:34:38,800
Stop crying!

1564
01:34:39,220 --> 01:34:39,560
All right?

1565
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:40,440
This is business.

1566
01:34:40,820 --> 01:34:41,560
Look around, pal.

1567
01:34:41,780 --> 01:34:43,140
This is how businesses are run.

1568
01:34:43,340 --> 01:34:44,440
Now, you should have known that...

1569
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:45,320
Oh, he's definitely not.

1570
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:45,860
Guys, sorry.

1571
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:46,360
He's not.

1572
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:46,920
...tissues.

1573
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:47,780
Come on, pal.

1574
01:34:48,860 --> 01:34:49,060
Bah!

1575
01:34:49,420 --> 01:34:49,920
...

1576
01:34:54,530 --> 01:34:55,810
That's not about this.

1577
01:34:55,850 --> 01:34:56,270
That's a...

1578
01:34:56,270 --> 01:34:57,810
That's a father and son.

1579
01:34:58,250 --> 01:34:59,890
That's actually a home issue.

1580
01:35:01,150 --> 01:35:03,130
We love it here at M-Corp.

1581
01:35:03,270 --> 01:35:06,390
And we are not going anywhere.

1582
01:35:06,390 --> 01:35:07,550
Wait, is this not Tim Robinson?

1583
01:35:07,890 --> 01:35:08,950
We'll be here a long time.

1584
01:35:11,170 --> 01:35:12,210
What's going on?

1585
01:35:14,690 --> 01:35:16,530
The leader in Creed...

1586
01:35:17,730 --> 01:35:19,110
It is Tim Robinson?

1587
01:35:19,210 --> 01:35:20,350
I fucking knew it!

1588
01:35:20,490 --> 01:35:21,970
I know my SNL guy!

1589
01:35:23,450 --> 01:35:24,410
A writer!

1590
01:35:24,410 --> 01:35:24,510
A writer!

1591
01:35:24,530 --> 01:35:32,630
Writer and performer on the NBC sketch comedy series, Saturday Night Live, from 2012 to 2014!

1592
01:35:33,290 --> 01:35:34,430
I fucking knew it!

1593
01:35:35,350 --> 01:35:36,450
Hey, Jeff!

1594
01:35:36,570 --> 01:35:37,430
How you doing, bud?

1595
01:35:38,630 --> 01:35:39,830
I knew...

1596
01:35:39,830 --> 01:35:41,350
I know my SNL guy!

1597
01:35:42,530 --> 01:35:44,630
They're going to need a lot of cleaning that up.

1598
01:35:44,730 --> 01:35:45,330
That's bad.

1599
01:35:47,210 --> 01:35:48,150
Is this gay?

1600
01:35:51,870 --> 01:35:52,830
It's real!

1601
01:35:53,070 --> 01:35:53,570
It's real!

1602
01:35:53,570 --> 01:35:53,630
It's real!

1603
01:35:53,630 --> 01:35:53,850
It's real!

1604
01:35:53,850 --> 01:35:54,130
It's real!

1605
01:35:59,350 --> 01:36:00,270
What an ad.

1606
01:36:00,370 --> 01:36:02,130
I thought it was something regarding corporate stuff.

1607
01:36:03,690 --> 01:36:04,730
But it was just...

1608
01:36:04,730 --> 01:36:05,350
It was Sk8.

1609
01:36:05,530 --> 01:36:07,310
I was going to say, it was just Sk8.

1610
01:36:07,390 --> 01:36:09,590
But I know my chat was like, it's not just Sk8!

1611
01:36:10,790 --> 01:36:12,970
I meant, like, but it's Sk8.

1612
01:36:18,270 --> 01:36:18,750
Oh,

1613
01:36:25,610 --> 01:36:26,630
console playtesting.

1614
01:36:26,730 --> 01:36:27,970
Console playtesting?

1615
01:36:29,530 --> 01:36:33,090
Very exciting that people will finally be able to play Sk8 on PC.

1616
01:36:33,090 --> 01:36:34,490
It'll be available on console in the near future.

1617
01:36:34,910 --> 01:36:38,070
Our next world premiere of Indie Censation from Japan is...

1618
01:36:38,070 --> 01:36:38,450
Get escape the poor thing.

1619
01:36:39,230 --> 01:36:39,790
...is why...

1620
01:36:39,790 --> 01:36:42,530
...it has over 25 million players worldwide.

1621
01:36:43,470 --> 01:36:44,910
That's right, I'm talking about PAL World.

1622
01:36:44,910 --> 01:36:46,570
Wait, PAL World?!

1623
01:36:46,570 --> 01:36:49,130
I mean, just look at the giant depresso.

1624
01:36:49,350 --> 01:36:50,190
Sure buddy.

1625
01:36:50,370 --> 01:36:50,750
Wow!

1626
01:36:50,870 --> 01:36:51,550
Summer game test.

1627
01:36:51,610 --> 01:36:52,170
Now, here's the first major update announcement.

1628
01:36:52,170 --> 01:36:55,350
Guys, this is why Nintendo doesn't let Jeff play.

1629
01:36:55,390 --> 01:36:56,510
A whole new island is coming.

1630
01:36:56,710 --> 01:37:00,330
This is why Nintendo doesn't join in on Jeff's stuff.

1631
01:37:00,750 --> 01:37:01,310
I know!

1632
01:37:01,310 --> 01:37:02,030
I know!

1633
01:37:02,030 --> 01:37:02,530
I know!

1634
01:37:02,530 --> 01:37:02,570
I know!

1635
01:37:02,570 --> 01:37:02,650
I know!

1636
01:37:06,650 --> 01:37:10,550
I like how Jeb was like, I wish, I hope Nintendo comes back to us.

1637
01:37:10,810 --> 01:37:14,670
And then they released this.

1638
01:37:17,890 --> 01:37:19,210
Did you guys see that?

1639
01:37:19,890 --> 01:37:21,470
Oh shit, New Island!

1640
01:37:21,790 --> 01:37:28,810
Did you guys see that news article where Jeb was saying I hope Nintendo one day rejoins the the shows.

1641
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:36,620
Oh shit.

1642
01:37:36,900 --> 01:37:39,520
Wait, the new update looks fucking sick.

1643
01:37:40,580 --> 01:37:41,840
Oh my god, finally.

1644
01:37:43,140 --> 01:37:45,600
Finally something subspecies.

1645
01:37:45,740 --> 01:37:46,900
Oh no.

1646
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:50,680
Jeb, you fucked up, Jeb.

1647
01:37:50,740 --> 01:37:52,680
I don't think Nintendo's gonna come back.

1648
01:38:00,090 --> 01:38:02,370
Oh my god, oil rigs?

1649
01:38:02,370 --> 01:38:03,710
Wait, this is rust!

1650
01:38:05,110 --> 01:38:06,230
Oh my god, oil rigs?

1651
01:38:06,230 --> 01:38:06,230
Wait, this is rust!

1652
01:38:07,370 --> 01:38:07,850
Arena?

1653
01:38:08,150 --> 01:38:10,230
Oh shit, wait, this is sick!

1654
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,460
Wait, the arenas look sick.

1655
01:38:16,540 --> 01:38:17,220
Yeah, the PVP.

1656
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:25,440
What is this?

1657
01:38:25,780 --> 01:38:27,360
Sakura update.

1658
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:29,460
Oh wait, hey, that's like this month!

1659
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:38,480
That's this new waifu.

1660
01:38:39,060 --> 01:38:39,240
Valorant.

1661
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:41,020
Valorant?

1662
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:44,560
New character?

1663
01:38:47,380 --> 01:38:48,260
Thanks, Jeb.

1664
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:49,360
Hey, everyone.

1665
01:38:49,700 --> 01:38:56,780
Since 2020, we have been fortunate to serve players in their pursuit of what we call the Valorant moment.

1666
01:38:56,940 --> 01:38:59,560
Oh my god, we can have a Power Dragoon server!

1667
01:39:00,260 --> 01:39:02,080
That'd be so fun.

1668
01:39:02,680 --> 01:39:03,200
For members.

1669
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:07,160
Millions of players all over the world have earned their own Valorant moments on PC.

1670
01:39:07,660 --> 01:39:12,000
And today, the stage is set to welcome a whole new group of players.

1671
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:13,240
Let's take a look.

1672
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:25,680
Valorant?

1673
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:26,760
Mobile?

1674
01:39:57,130 --> 01:39:58,010
Oh, console?

1675
01:39:59,150 --> 01:40:02,090
There's no way they're gonna put crossplay.

1676
01:40:07,350 --> 01:40:08,830
There's no way.

1677
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:19,320
But, where is it?

1678
01:40:25,450 --> 01:40:25,970
Why?

1679
01:40:38,150 --> 01:40:38,670
But...

1680
01:40:39,270 --> 01:40:44,070
I guess if they hook console players in, they have more people buy skins?

1681
01:40:45,030 --> 01:40:46,750
They want more people to buy skins?

1682
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:55,540
Because I'm just like, thinking, why would Huni put Valorant on console?

1683
01:40:56,220 --> 01:41:02,300
It'd be smart, honestly, it'd be smarter to put it on mobile rather than console.

1684
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:04,240
More people would...

1685
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:08,520
Because like, a lot of people in Asia play FPS games on mobile.

1686
01:41:11,240 --> 01:41:12,800
Because it's very popular.

1687
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:17,500
That was Valorant's core tactical gameplay.

1688
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:22,200
Everything you just saw was captured on console and with a controller.

1689
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:27,940
Valorant is coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S this year.

1690
01:41:28,160 --> 01:41:30,360
Our limited beta starts June 14th.

1691
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:40,560
And you can sign up right now at beta.playvalorant.com We are so excited for your input to make sure that Valorant plays great on console.

1692
01:41:40,820 --> 01:41:42,100
And we hope to see you soon.

1693
01:41:42,100 --> 01:41:47,640
But before we go, here's the head of Valorant's studio, Anna Donlan.

1694
01:41:49,980 --> 01:41:50,800
Thanks, guys.

1695
01:41:50,980 --> 01:41:51,660
Hey, everyone.

1696
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:57,740
One of my favorite things about Valorant has been seeing the community build the game and the sport right along with us.

1697
01:41:57,740 --> 01:41:58,640
Is this a VCT?

1698
01:41:59,300 --> 01:42:09,860
We have been on the most amazing journey, bringing Valorant to players all around the world, most recently to China, where I'm currently a Valorant Masters one of our largest global tournaments and community celebrations.

1699
01:42:10,300 --> 01:42:10,880
Oh, shit.

1700
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:11,880
VCT is on now?

1701
01:42:12,900 --> 01:42:13,880
Oh, it's in Shanghai?

1702
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:15,920
That's what I'm saying.

1703
01:42:16,140 --> 01:42:27,980
There's no way they're gonna have a competitive... There's more of a chance to have a competitive Valorant mobile team than a competitive console team for Valorant.

1704
01:42:29,300 --> 01:42:29,460
There's like...

1705
01:42:30,240 --> 01:42:32,960
There's like big esports for mobile gaming.

1706
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:39,900
They might as well just put it as a mobile game versus a console.

1707
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:45,960
And mobile games are already used to spending money.

1708
01:42:50,440 --> 01:42:56,600
All I'm saying is that mobile games are already used to spending money on gacha and skins.

1709
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:58,620
True.

1710
01:43:04,700 --> 01:43:06,680
Look at Mobile Apex.

1711
01:43:06,900 --> 01:43:10,800
Mobile Apex died so fast not because of the lack of a player base.

1712
01:43:11,420 --> 01:43:12,800
That's all I'm gonna say.

1713
01:43:15,140 --> 01:43:19,320
It was more so of like legal stuff.

1714
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:30,760
Because if you guys didn't know, the company that made Apex Mobile made their own version of Apex afterwards.

1715
01:43:34,420 --> 01:43:36,940
Because it's a different company.

1716
01:43:37,540 --> 01:43:40,460
A different company made the Apex Mobile.

1717
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:48,960
And then they yoinked it and like made their own version after that.

1718
01:43:59,970 --> 01:44:02,150
And it's popular by the way.

1719
01:44:02,270 --> 01:44:06,290
It's It's popular too.

1720
01:44:06,550 --> 01:44:09,230
Thanks to the team at Riot for sharing that with us here at SGF.

1721
01:44:09,350 --> 01:44:12,650

01:44:23,270 --> 01:44:25,550
Or they're not don't cook but they're too lazy.

1727
01:44:25,970 --> 01:44:27,130
Or they're not don't cook but they're too lazy.

1728
01:44:27,150 --> 01:44:28,190
This is an amazing voice actor.

1729
01:44:28,390 --> 01:44:29,670
He knows what they see.

1730
01:44:29,830 --> 01:44:32,730
Such as Like a Dragon and God of War Ragnarok.

1731
01:44:32,870 --> 01:44:43,270
Well next week Yong is going to be voicing a character in a movie Inside Out 2 where he plays a fictional video game character Lance Slashblade.

1732
01:44:43,630 --> 01:44:46,710
And we've got your exclusive first look.

1733
01:44:46,830 --> 01:44:47,450
Check this out.

1734
01:44:49,310 --> 01:44:52,310
Welcome to your eternal fate.

1735
01:44:53,410 --> 01:44:54,610
Lance Slashblade?

1736
01:44:54,830 --> 01:44:56,910
But he's a video game character.

1737
01:44:57,150 --> 01:44:57,930
Why is he here?

1738
01:44:58,430 --> 01:45:00,570
Why is a movie here?

1739
01:45:01,610 --> 01:45:03,190
Pixar sponsored this?

1740
01:45:03,330 --> 01:45:04,010
I wanted to be a hero.

1741
01:45:04,430 --> 01:45:12,330
Pixar was in the same same show as the other game that got released where they were smoking some.

1742
01:45:14,250 --> 01:45:15,810
Don't you dare say that.

1743
01:45:15,910 --> 01:45:17,770
You do not deserve to be thrown away.

1744
01:45:18,090 --> 01:45:19,390
Oh my god.

1745
01:45:19,950 --> 01:45:21,510
Don't you remember his power move?

1746
01:45:22,030 --> 01:45:23,430
I'm coming for you Riley.

1747
01:45:27,720 --> 01:45:29,960
No one is totally worthless.

1748
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:33,400
A warrior cursed with a feeble attack.

1749
01:45:33,720 --> 01:45:34,900
Then you must make your curse your gift.

1750
01:45:34,900 --> 01:45:36,180
It's a Pixar trailer.

1751
01:45:37,780 --> 01:45:41,780
Shield yourself my friends for I shall set you all free.

1752
01:45:44,260 --> 01:45:44,900
Okay.

1753
01:45:45,460 --> 01:45:46,100
Alright.

1754
01:45:46,260 --> 01:45:46,720
Okay.

1755
01:45:46,760 --> 01:45:47,480
Not gonna lie.

1756
01:45:48,020 --> 01:46:04,960
The fact that Pixar was was in was in the Summer Game Fest and the third trailer we saw was like a group of prisoners, you know doing some things.

1757
01:46:06,980 --> 01:46:08,060
It's kinda wild.

1758
01:46:09,320 --> 01:46:13,200
And yes, Chicken does look a lot like Ken Jeong.

1759
01:46:13,480 --> 01:46:21,920
And today Chicken is excited to share a new game that Chicken and Chicken's buddies are in called Squad Busters.

1760
01:46:22,100 --> 01:46:27,960
You fight monsters collect lots of shiny things and Chicken has a big role.

1761
01:46:28,100 --> 01:46:30,420
I know some of you guys are saying it might be cringe.

1762
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:31,420
And here it is.

1763
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:33,080
Like this trailer is cringe?

1764
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:38,260
Or like you're like wow this is embarrassing and sad.

1765
01:46:38,580 --> 01:46:51,160
It's not that sad because you know damn well Ken Jeong just got paid at least $500,000 just to be there for like just to be in a one minute trailer.

1766
01:46:52,300 --> 01:46:56,040
laughter laughter laughter laughter I should keep the definition of fun.

1767
01:46:56,220 --> 01:46:59,320
I am butt naked from the waist down so.

1768
01:46:59,640 --> 01:47:00,800
Get out of the f baikin bed dude.

1769
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:03,280
Respect the gray.

1770
01:47:03,900 --> 01:47:05,860
Sign me up.

1771
01:47:07,940 --> 01:47:11,560
Bro this tro is in here?

1772
01:47:12,220 --> 01:47:18,140
Holy shit what, what was there was no budget Chris Hemsworth is in here.

1773
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:19,880
There no budget.

1774
01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:26,300
You know damn well Well, Chris Hemsworth was paid at least a million dollars.

1775
01:47:39,740 --> 01:47:41,640
No, this game company!

1776
01:47:41,820 --> 01:47:43,040
Bro, was it Brawl Stars?

1777
01:47:44,150 --> 01:47:45,280
It's like one of the three.

1778
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:50,860
It's like Raid Shadow Legends where they're everywhere.

1779
01:47:52,920 --> 01:47:53,760
I've been wrong!

1780
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,160
I've been down!

1781
01:47:56,980 --> 01:47:58,720
Look at these clowns.

1782
01:47:58,720 --> 01:47:59,740
You call this a squat?

1783
01:47:59,940 --> 01:48:01,440
Oh yeah, Clash of the Clans, yeah.

1784
01:48:03,740 --> 01:48:04,180
Pathetic.

1785
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:05,240
Imposter.

1786
01:48:06,100 --> 01:48:06,540
Jinx.

1787
01:48:06,640 --> 01:48:06,980
Jinx.

1788
01:48:07,220 --> 01:48:07,660
Jinx.

1789
01:48:07,940 --> 01:48:09,060
No, you Jinx.

1790
01:48:09,180 --> 01:48:10,600
Are you supposed to be a lumberjack?

1791
01:48:16,060 --> 01:48:19,960
Yeah, Clash of the Clans is crazy profitable apparently.

1792
01:48:21,320 --> 01:48:24,760
Oh my god!

1793
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:26,800
This is a long trailer.

1794
01:48:27,160 --> 01:48:30,260
They spent... they paid Jeff a lot of money.

1795
01:48:34,540 --> 01:48:37,520
Bro, Clash of the Clans is even in the Super Bowl ads.

1796
01:48:39,740 --> 01:48:41,060
Was it Clash Royale?

1797
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:50,700
Clash of Clans?

1798
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:52,220
It's either Clash of Clans...

1799
01:48:52,220 --> 01:48:53,180
It's one of them.

1800
01:48:53,200 --> 01:48:54,380
It's one of the screaming...

1801
01:48:54,380 --> 01:48:56,260
Screaming Man icons.

1802
01:48:56,860 --> 01:48:59,080
You know the mobile game used with the screaming man?

1803
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:00,500
It's one of them.

1804
01:49:01,280 --> 01:49:02,900
Oh, Squad Busters.

1805
01:49:03,260 --> 01:49:04,500
It's one of them.

1806
01:49:11,100 --> 01:49:19,000
Alright, please join me in welcoming to the SGF stage Monster Hunter series producer, Mr. Ryozo Tujimono!

1807
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:20,240
Ryozo-san!

1808
01:49:22,420 --> 01:49:24,980
Like, you guys might be like, who plays this game?

1809
01:49:25,240 --> 01:49:25,860
Normies.

1810
01:49:26,420 --> 01:49:27,800
Normies play this game.

1811
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:30,660
Normie plays Clash of Clans, guys.

1812
01:49:34,280 --> 01:49:36,400
A lot of normies.

1813
01:49:41,560 --> 01:49:42,580
Thank you, Jeff.

1814
01:49:43,180 --> 01:49:44,700
Normies are not watching this.

1815
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:46,800
That's why they have a trailer for this!

1816
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:48,820
They want non-Normies too!

1817
01:49:49,320 --> 01:49:54,940
I want everyone to be on the lookout for a very mysterious large monster near the end of the trailer, as it's an important monster within the game.

1818
01:49:55,320 --> 01:49:59,800
Yes, in this game, we are working on a combination of immersion and action.

1819
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:12,700
Monster Hunter Wilds will be available on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC in 2025.

1820
01:50:12,700 --> 01:50:14,320
And it will be released on PC at the same time.

1821
01:50:15,860 --> 01:50:19,300
Also, this time, we will be playing it with you for more than 100 years.

1822
01:50:19,680 --> 01:50:21,820
He's trying to be like, alright, bye!

1823
01:50:21,980 --> 01:50:22,500
Bye!

1824
01:50:23,720 --> 01:50:27,480
I like how the translator was about to say something.

1825
01:50:27,500 --> 01:50:30,800
As you'll see, we are working to deliver a gaming experience that merges immersion and action.

1826
01:50:30,980 --> 01:50:42,620
I hope players look forward to playing with their friends across different platforms when the game launches simultaneously in 2025 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC.

1827
01:50:43,140 --> 01:50:44,520
This is the last part.

1828
01:50:46,900 --> 01:50:50,100
The opening night live of Gamescom will be held in August.

1829
01:50:50,100 --> 01:50:52,080
We will bring you a new video.

1830
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:55,220
Oh my god, there's cross-play?

1831
01:50:55,980 --> 01:50:58,260
Oh my god, you can play with your Switch friends!

1832
01:50:58,780 --> 01:51:00,160
And yell at them!

1833
01:51:01,240 --> 01:51:02,580
For their 30 friends!

1834
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:12,880
Lastly, there will be a new trailer for Monster Hunter Wilds at opening night live at Gamescom in August.

1835
01:51:13,200 --> 01:51:18,820
And our first public hands-on playable demo of Monster Hunter Wilds will also debut at Gamescom.

1836
01:51:18,820 --> 01:51:22,160
Literally every- Wait, they're releasing everywhere but the Switch?

1837
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:25,340
Oh my god.

1838
01:51:26,580 --> 01:51:27,300
Sorry, Nintendo.

1839
01:51:30,580 --> 01:51:33,300
The Switch cannot run this game.

1840
01:51:38,430 --> 01:51:40,570
It's so weird hearing them, like, talk.

1841
01:51:41,370 --> 01:51:42,870
Like, actual words.

1842
01:51:44,270 --> 01:51:48,990
I swear, they don't usually- I feel like- Do you know what I mean?

1843
01:51:48,990 --> 01:51:51,530
Some of the characters used to, like, have their own language.

1844
01:52:10,750 --> 01:52:13,290
Oh my god, show us the PP dragon!

1845
01:52:24,010 --> 01:52:25,350
You know, that one!

1846
01:52:29,970 --> 01:52:35,890
Oh my god!

1847
01:52:38,770 --> 01:52:40,230
I don't like the mouth.

1848
01:52:40,230 --> 01:52:42,870
That mouth makes me uncomfortable!

1849
01:52:52,190 --> 01:52:53,070
Woah!

1850
01:52:53,690 --> 01:52:54,570
He's gripping!

1851
01:53:04,870 --> 01:53:08,710
I'm so- Somebody akasupan!

1852
01:53:10,970 --> 01:53:14,470
Somebody akasupan in the Game Awards channel!

1853
01:53:18,430 --> 01:53:19,670
Yeah, Jeff!

1854
01:53:19,890 --> 01:53:21,990
Have some more money, Jeff!

1855
01:53:23,190 --> 01:53:23,750
Wooo!

1856
01:53:23,870 --> 01:53:24,350
Thank you!

1857
01:53:24,390 --> 01:53:27,250
We will see you at Gamescom in August.

1858
01:53:27,470 --> 01:53:36,430
During last year's PlayStation Showcase, the game Phantom Blade Zero from S-Game wowed us all with its blazing fast combat and stylish art.

1859
01:53:36,630 --> 01:53:41,630
Well, I'm honored to share with you the brand new trailer for the game featuring all real gameplay.

1860
01:53:41,950 --> 01:53:45,010
Here's our final game of the show, Phantom Blade Zero!

1861
01:53:45,490 --> 01:53:47,270
Ooh, Phantom Blade Zero.

1862
01:53:48,850 --> 01:53:49,810
This looks good.

1863
01:53:51,790 --> 01:53:53,530
Gameplay trailer, gameplay trailer.

1864
01:53:53,850 --> 01:53:55,150
Wait, this is the final game?

1865
01:53:56,030 --> 01:53:57,610
They're ending it off here?

1866
01:53:58,470 --> 01:53:59,070
No!

1867
01:53:59,410 --> 01:54:00,590
That can't be!

1868
01:54:01,010 --> 01:54:04,010
They always give us a surprise after they say final!

1869
01:54:08,130 --> 01:54:10,070
The face of this is here!

1870
01:54:10,390 --> 01:54:13,150
You got skaked before so-song, isn't that sad?

1871
01:54:13,730 --> 01:54:14,330
Don't.

1872
01:54:15,210 --> 01:54:16,450
Don't go up there.

1873
01:54:17,850 --> 01:54:18,750
Turn back.

1874
01:54:18,750 --> 01:54:20,590
My favorite are the people- No!

1875
01:54:20,610 --> 01:54:21,430
Not the horse!

1876
01:54:22,430 --> 01:54:22,990
Anyway.

1877
01:54:23,370 --> 01:54:26,890
My favorite are the people that were coping about Kingdom Hearts 4.

1878
01:54:27,090 --> 01:54:29,490
After Jeff was like, there's no Kingdom Hearts 4.

1879
01:54:29,770 --> 01:54:31,910
And everybody was like, sure, Jeff.

1880
01:54:32,130 --> 01:54:33,830
No Kingdom Hearts 4.

1881
01:54:34,150 --> 01:54:34,710
Sure.

1882
01:54:46,040 --> 01:54:47,700
I'm still coping.

1883
01:54:51,720 --> 01:54:52,280
There's a lot for you to look for.

1884
01:54:52,280 --> 01:54:53,540
Asiq, thank you for the Twitch friend!

1885
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:53,960
Thank you!

1886
01:54:55,380 --> 01:54:57,160
I mean, it looks...

1887
01:54:57,160 --> 01:54:57,920
Is it Souls?

1888
01:54:59,060 --> 01:55:00,260
Is this a Souls-like?

1889
01:55:00,740 --> 01:55:01,320
It is.

1890
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:09,720
Yeah, it looks like Sekiro.

1891
01:55:10,060 --> 01:55:10,620
Souls.

1892
01:55:15,120 --> 01:55:16,340
Oh my god.

1893
01:55:16,620 --> 01:55:17,820
What the fuck?

1894
01:55:25,160 --> 01:55:27,500
20-24 World Tour, demo.

1895
01:55:28,240 --> 01:55:29,360
June 8th.

1896
01:55:29,360 --> 01:55:29,920
Oh!

1897
01:55:30,740 --> 01:55:31,220
Oh!

1898
01:55:31,220 --> 01:55:33,520
Guys, you guys go to Summer Game Fest right now!

1899
01:55:33,540 --> 01:55:34,080
You can play it!

1900
01:55:34,520 --> 01:55:35,720
That looks so good.

1901
01:55:35,800 --> 01:55:37,660
Full demo of the media you'll be playing this weekend.

1902
01:55:38,100 --> 01:55:40,260
That's why people paid a ticket, guys.

1903
01:55:40,640 --> 01:55:41,980
This is the reason.

1904
01:55:42,160 --> 01:55:43,360
Just for that game.

1905
01:55:44,200 --> 01:55:45,420
Thank you, Jeff.

1906
01:55:45,940 --> 01:55:48,020
I had such an amazing time.

1907
01:55:48,320 --> 01:55:50,020
Happy Summer Game Fest, everyone.

1908
01:55:50,020 --> 01:55:54,280
All the people here are like finally the reason why I'm here.

1909
01:55:54,700 --> 01:56:01,240
Day of the Devs is coming up live right now on the stream featuring an hour of indie game reveals including the next game from Cappy.

1910
01:56:01,360 --> 01:56:02,100
Guys, surprise?

1911
01:56:02,120 --> 01:56:02,980
Surprise release?

1912
01:56:03,240 --> 01:56:04,320
Surprise trailer?

1913
01:56:05,200 --> 01:56:13,160
For other event streams this weekend and we'll see you again live this August 20th in Germany for Gamescom opening night live.

1914
01:56:13,380 --> 01:56:14,380
Thanks for watching, everyone.

1915
01:56:14,680 --> 01:56:17,080
Remember, Day of the Devs starts right now.

1916
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:18,420
It can't be the last one.

1917
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:19,280
What?

1918
01:56:20,520 --> 01:56:21,380
Surprise trailer?

1919
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:26,120
Surprise trailer?

1920
01:56:27,560 --> 01:56:29,000
Where's the surprise trailer?

1921
01:56:29,060 --> 01:56:29,080
Where's the surprise trailer?

1922
01:56:29,080 --> 01:56:29,080
Where's the surprise trailer?

1923
01:56:29,080 --> 01:56:29,080
Where's the surprise trailer?

1924
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:32,100
Oh, wow.

1925
01:56:32,100 --> 01:56:32,240
Where's?

1926
01:56:32,240 --> 01:56:33,560
the gotcha moment?

1927
01:56:33,640 --> 01:56:37,980
Coming in with a steel chair Uh.

1928
01:56:37,980 --> 01:56:40,960
Alright we don't care about Day of the devs.

1929
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:46,320
We love Devs, but we don't really care right now.

1930
01:56:48,820 --> 01:56:54,320
The surprise moment was that there was no surprise... NOOOOO!

1931
01:56:55,720 --> 01:56:58,620
What do you mean there was no surprise!

1932
01:57:00,940 --> 01:57:04,440
Alright, no, I think the most funny part was somebody Akasupa-ing.

1933
01:57:04,580 --> 01:57:05,840
One of the most funny parts.

1934
01:57:06,060 --> 01:57:07,760
Wait, let me see who- I'm gonna read their Akasupa.

1935
01:57:08,580 --> 01:57:10,840
There's two Akasupas?!

1936
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,560
Somebody donated 200 euros!

1937
01:57:16,580 --> 01:57:19,360
Somebody Aka'd Aka 200 euros!

1938
01:57:19,680 --> 01:57:25,880
To, like, knock and tell my mom that Soulstone Survivors is also part of the Summerfest.

1939
01:57:34,790 --> 01:57:35,890
Okay, wait.

1940
01:57:35,990 --> 01:57:38,590
I'm- I'm trying- I'm reading.

1941
01:57:38,890 --> 01:57:45,510
Okay, this is the other- This is the other Akas- The other Akasup.

1942
01:57:49,470 --> 01:57:50,210
Okay.

1943
01:57:52,230 --> 01:57:59,850
I'm edging this entire stream until Dragon Ball Z Sparking or Batman VR comes out.

1944
01:58:07,470 --> 01:58:09,150
Holy shit.

1945
01:58:09,350 --> 01:58:14,970
Bro, this man has- This king low has expectations, bro.

1946
01:58:15,270 --> 01:58:18,310
Why was one of them Batman VR?

1947
01:58:19,270 --> 01:58:30,690
Like, wha- Like, out of all the games, this guy's most hyped out about Batman VR.

1948
01:58:32,010 --> 01:58:34,750
Exclusively on the meta quest.

1949
01:58:34,750 --> 01:58:36,290
Like, what?!

1950
01:58:36,290 --> 01:58:37,610
My god, bro.

1951
01:58:37,830 --> 01:58:38,250
God.

1952
01:58:39,950 --> 01:58:42,790
He's almost like that chatterer about Capcom.

1953
01:58:43,110 --> 01:58:43,510
Woo!

1954
01:58:43,630 --> 01:58:44,490
Go Capcom!

1955
01:58:44,570 --> 01:58:45,710
Give us nothing!

1956
01:58:47,950 --> 01:58:52,710
That- That comment, there's, like, Renfree in my head.

1957
01:58:53,030 --> 01:58:55,670
That actually was so good.

1958
01:58:56,030 --> 01:58:58,950
He's picking up a broken-ass man.

1959
01:58:59,410 --> 01:59:01,650
Yeah- It's just that it's Renfree!

1960
01:59:01,970 --> 01:59:02,650
Like...

1961
01:59:05,650 --> 01:59:06,990
Aw, I'm so...

1962
01:59:07,890 --> 01:59:11,850
Oh my gosh, I'm so sad that the Wukong game did not have...

1963
01:59:11,850 --> 01:59:13,990
Uh, did not have more...

1964
01:59:13,990 --> 01:59:15,490
Uh, did not have gameplay trailer.

1965
01:59:15,770 --> 01:59:17,930
I would've loved to see more gameplay trailer of that game.

1966
01:59:18,130 --> 01:59:19,210
Cause it looks pretty!

1967
01:59:20,030 --> 01:59:20,510
But...

1968
01:59:20,510 --> 01:59:22,570
It looks pretty, but like...

1969
01:59:22,570 --> 01:59:23,950
I wanna see gameplay!

1970
01:59:24,830 --> 01:59:26,810
I wanna see gameplay!

1971
01:59:26,810 --> 01:59:28,430
I wanna see more gameplay.

1972
01:59:29,230 --> 01:59:30,450
That's what I wanted.

1973
01:59:30,770 --> 01:59:32,270
But we didn't get that.

1974
01:59:32,490 --> 01:59:33,370
Also, also, great!

1975
01:59:33,470 --> 01:59:33,830
Good news!

1976
01:59:33,910 --> 01:59:34,210
Good news!

1977
01:59:34,390 --> 01:59:34,730
Uh...

1978
01:59:34,730 --> 01:59:35,850
I just wanna give you guys an update.

1979
01:59:36,770 --> 01:59:37,250
About...

1980
01:59:37,250 --> 01:59:38,030
Um...

1981
01:59:38,510 --> 01:59:39,690
About the U2's figure.

1982
01:59:40,070 --> 01:59:40,950
So, like...

1983
01:59:40,950 --> 01:59:41,570
Uh...

1984
01:59:41,570 --> 01:59:43,470
We're gonna have...

1985
01:59:43,470 --> 01:59:43,990
Um...

1986
01:59:43,990 --> 01:59:45,710
Cause I know there's, like, restricted countries.

1987
01:59:46,130 --> 01:59:47,030
But, um...

1988
01:59:47,030 --> 01:59:51,650
I know we have a lot of dragoons in South Korea and the Philippines.

1989
01:59:52,070 --> 01:59:55,010
So, like, I convinced U2's to open shipping.

1990
01:59:55,370 --> 01:59:56,230
For, like...

1991
01:59:56,230 --> 01:59:56,670
Uh...

1992
01:59:56,670 --> 01:59:58,530
Cause, like, Philippines was a restricted country.

1993
01:59:59,030 --> 01:59:59,510
Um...

1994
01:59:59,510 --> 02:00:04,330
And I convinced U2's to let, like, Filipino dragoons to be able to order...

1995
02:00:04,330 --> 02:00:04,850
Uh...

1996
02:00:04,850 --> 02:00:05,850
The U2's figure.

1997
02:00:05,990 --> 02:00:06,830
Just for my figure.

1998
02:00:08,410 --> 02:00:08,770
Um...

1999
02:00:08,770 --> 02:00:09,330
And...

2000
02:00:09,330 --> 02:00:12,190
Right now, we're trying to work on South Korea as well, too.

2001
02:00:12,390 --> 02:00:14,250
We're trying to include South Korea right now.

2002
02:00:14,610 --> 02:00:14,970
Um...

2003
02:00:14,970 --> 02:00:15,930
Into, like...

2004
02:00:15,930 --> 02:00:16,530
Uh...

2005
02:00:16,530 --> 02:00:17,050
The...

2006
02:00:17,050 --> 02:00:19,190
Into, like, people can order the U2's figure.

2007
02:00:19,550 --> 02:00:19,910
Yes.

2008
02:00:19,950 --> 02:00:20,930
I basically was, like...

2009
02:00:20,930 --> 02:00:21,950
Oh, I have a lot of fans.

2010
02:00:22,170 --> 02:00:26,070
I know I have a lot of Filipino dragoons and a lot of South Korean dragoons.

2011
02:00:26,290 --> 02:00:27,910
And, like, I really wanna open pre...

2012
02:00:27,910 --> 02:00:28,850
If we can, like...

2013
02:00:28,850 --> 02:00:30,590
I know, like, you guys are...

2014
02:00:30,590 --> 02:00:34,070
Usually, it's a restricted country for shipping and stuff.

2015
02:00:34,810 --> 02:00:35,210
Um...

2016
02:00:35,210 --> 02:00:38,570
But, like, could we please have it open just for my figure?

2017
02:00:38,690 --> 02:00:40,230
And they're, like, yeah, we can work on it.

2018
02:00:40,310 --> 02:00:43,290
And right now, they successfully have for Philippines.

2019
02:00:43,630 --> 02:00:45,870
We're now working on South Korea at the moment.

2020
02:00:45,930 --> 02:00:46,710
We're working on that.

2021
02:00:47,110 --> 02:00:47,510
Uh...

2022
02:00:47,510 --> 02:00:49,010
So, I haven't tweeted it out yet.

2023
02:00:49,050 --> 02:00:50,070
Cause I'm gonna see if we can.

2024
02:00:50,410 --> 02:00:51,470
I'm gonna see if we can.

2025
02:00:52,110 --> 02:00:52,510
Um...

2026
02:00:52,510 --> 02:00:54,550
And it's just for my U2's figure, too.

2027
02:00:54,710 --> 02:00:55,470
It's just for mine.

2028
02:00:55,610 --> 02:00:56,930
Cause I was, like, I know you guys...

2029
02:00:56,930 --> 02:00:57,390
I...

2030
02:00:57,390 --> 02:00:58,630
I got you guys.

2031
02:00:58,850 --> 02:00:59,510
I know you...

2032
02:00:59,510 --> 02:01:00,510
I got you guys.

2033
02:01:02,330 --> 02:01:04,050
I saw a lot of people were like...

2034
02:01:04,070 --> 02:01:05,110
We're crying about it.

2035
02:01:05,170 --> 02:01:06,030
So, I was like, please.

2036
02:01:06,750 --> 02:01:06,990
I...

2037
02:01:09,010 --> 02:01:10,030
But don't worry.

2038
02:01:10,290 --> 02:01:11,150
I got you.

2039
02:01:11,790 --> 02:01:15,310
I was, like, specifically asking them if they could make an exception for me.

2040
02:01:15,430 --> 02:01:16,570
And they're, like, yeah, yeah.

2041
02:01:16,630 --> 02:01:17,450
We're gonna work on it.

2042
02:01:17,550 --> 02:01:17,850
Like...

2043
02:01:17,850 --> 02:01:18,650
So, I'm not sure.

2044
02:01:18,730 --> 02:01:19,770
I'm not tweeting it out yet.

2045
02:01:19,910 --> 02:01:21,490
I'm just gonna wait until, like, they...

2046
02:01:21,490 --> 02:01:23,990
They have South Korea in the shipping options.

2047
02:01:24,310 --> 02:01:25,750
And then, I'll tweet it out.

2048
02:01:26,570 --> 02:01:26,970
Um...

2049
02:01:26,970 --> 02:01:27,690
But, yeah.

2050
02:01:28,150 --> 02:01:28,530
Alright.

2051
02:01:28,830 --> 02:01:29,230
So...

2052
02:01:30,330 --> 02:01:30,730
Uh...

2053
02:01:30,730 --> 02:01:31,490
So...

2054
02:01:31,490 --> 02:01:32,150
Uh...

2055
02:01:32,150 --> 02:01:34,010
Tomorrow, I do have a collab.

2056
02:01:34,010 --> 02:01:34,030
So...

2057
02:01:34,030 --> 02:01:36,510
I'm gonna have a collab with Amelie and Zentreya in Apex.

2058
02:01:36,730 --> 02:01:38,770
But I think I won't be streaming my POV.

2059
02:01:38,850 --> 02:01:39,790
Because I'm still...

2060
02:01:39,790 --> 02:01:41,830
I wanna be, like, more chill.

2061
02:01:43,070 --> 02:01:45,810
Because I didn't really get to rest a lot this week.

2062
02:01:47,650 --> 02:01:48,170
So...

2063
02:01:48,170 --> 02:01:48,790
Um...

2064
02:01:48,790 --> 02:01:50,650
So, I'm gonna be doing...

2065
02:01:50,650 --> 02:01:51,370
I'm gonna be...

2066
02:01:51,370 --> 02:01:52,610
Have no POV.

2067
02:01:52,750 --> 02:01:55,230
But I'll retweet either Amelie or Zentreya's stream.

2068
02:01:55,830 --> 02:01:56,350
Um...

2069
02:01:56,350 --> 02:01:56,850
Anyway.

2070
02:01:56,910 --> 02:01:58,510
Next week will be a solo...

2071
02:01:58,510 --> 02:01:59,490
Solo stream week.

2072
02:01:59,530 --> 02:01:59,970
Next week.

2073
02:02:00,110 --> 02:02:00,590
Uh...

2074
02:02:00,590 --> 02:02:02,170
Since, like, the last three weeks.

2075
02:02:02,170 --> 02:02:06,590
We went from Tekken week to WrestleTuber week.

2076
02:02:06,810 --> 02:02:08,090
And then to...

2077
02:02:08,990 --> 02:02:10,890
And then to Minecraft week.

2078
02:02:11,090 --> 02:02:13,650
So next week will be solo stuff.

2079
02:02:13,790 --> 02:02:17,510
Because I just wanna hang out with my dragoons next week.

2080
02:02:17,610 --> 02:02:22,110
We had so many collabs in the last three weeks.

2081
02:02:22,390 --> 02:02:30,190
So next week is just gonna be gaming stuff with the dragoons.

2082
02:02:30,270 --> 02:02:31,150
Or, like, not with...

2083
02:02:31,150 --> 02:02:32,150
Not maybe with the dragoons.

2084
02:02:32,170 --> 02:02:32,890
But just...

2085
02:02:32,890 --> 02:02:34,390
Hang out with the dragoons.

2086
02:02:34,430 --> 02:02:35,490
With some solo content.

2087
02:02:36,110 --> 02:02:36,390
Uh...

2088
02:02:36,390 --> 02:02:36,710
So, yeah.

2089
02:02:36,770 --> 02:02:37,870
That's gonna be next week's plan.

2090
02:02:38,210 --> 02:02:38,670
I don't...

2091
02:02:38,670 --> 02:02:38,810
Yeah.

2092
02:02:38,910 --> 02:02:39,110
And I...

2093
02:02:39,110 --> 02:02:40,410
My social batteries ran out.

2094
02:02:40,490 --> 02:02:41,470
Like, a hundred percent.

2095
02:02:41,490 --> 02:02:42,390
I'm so...

2096
02:02:42,390 --> 02:02:42,690
I...

2097
02:02:42,690 --> 02:02:43,730
I'm so tired.

2098
02:02:46,350 --> 02:02:47,030
I'm so...

2099
02:02:47,030 --> 02:02:48,310
Also, another update!

2100
02:02:48,610 --> 02:02:49,230
We finally...

2101
02:02:50,910 --> 02:02:51,390
Finally...

2102
02:02:52,070 --> 02:02:52,550
Have...

2103
02:02:52,550 --> 02:02:54,590
I know I told you guys we have a distributor.

2104
02:02:54,830 --> 02:02:57,750
But the distributor has received the packages.

2105
02:02:58,210 --> 02:02:59,370
Which means...

2106
02:02:59,370 --> 02:02:59,910
Um...

2107
02:02:59,910 --> 02:03:02,390
They are starting to ship stuff out today.

2108
02:03:02,770 --> 02:03:04,150
They are giving an update.

2109
02:03:04,290 --> 02:03:05,950
They are starting to ship things out today.

2110
02:03:06,090 --> 02:03:07,130
The bundles...

2111
02:03:07,130 --> 02:03:08,990
Although I do have a little bad news.

2112
02:03:09,090 --> 02:03:10,470
The bundles will be...

2113
02:03:10,470 --> 02:03:14,190
Still be a little bit delayed because we had a small manufacturing error.

2114
02:03:14,490 --> 02:03:16,310
I will be making a full statement of this on Twitter.

2115
02:03:16,350 --> 02:03:20,810
I was just waiting for the distributor to send me a picture of all the orders being...

2116
02:03:20,810 --> 02:03:23,010
Of all the package orders that they're sending out today.

2117
02:03:24,510 --> 02:03:24,990
Um...

2118
02:03:24,990 --> 02:03:36,770
But the bundles will be a little bit delayed because we had a manufacturing order so we're We're waiting for the manufacturer to send in the new stuff.

2119
02:03:37,030 --> 02:03:39,890
Not like to send in the merch to fix it.

2120
02:03:40,070 --> 02:03:41,550
So we're still waiting for that.

2121
02:03:41,730 --> 02:03:46,650
But the debut merch is starting to ship out today.

2122
02:03:46,850 --> 02:03:47,590
So good news!

2123
02:03:47,810 --> 02:03:48,030
Yay!

2124
02:03:49,290 --> 02:03:50,170
Good news!

2125
02:03:52,450 --> 02:03:57,550
I'll give you guys a recap on the latest Minecraft drama on YouTube, by the way.

2126
02:03:57,550 --> 02:03:59,730
But I'll just give you guys an update.

2127
02:03:59,850 --> 02:04:02,970
It was so funny, because yesterday, more shit went down.

2128
02:04:03,090 --> 02:04:08,530
And the finals... Okay, the finals for that Minecraft event was fucking Connect Four.

2129
02:04:12,960 --> 02:04:17,940
It was Connect Four.

2130
02:04:18,220 --> 02:04:24,080
And there was a two-hour stalemate on fucking Connect Four.

2131
02:04:24,240 --> 02:04:28,580
That the two finalists ended up splitting the money.

2132
02:04:28,580 --> 02:04:31,420
Because they were in a stand-off.

2133
02:04:31,580 --> 02:04:34,960
Because they knew if they make a move, they'd lose the 70k.

2134
02:04:35,120 --> 02:04:38,600
So there was like a two-hour fucking stand-off.

2135
02:04:38,740 --> 02:04:41,020
Until they're like, just split the money.

2136
02:04:42,140 --> 02:04:45,400
They were like, organizers, just let us split the money.

2137
02:04:45,460 --> 02:04:47,360
If you don't split the money, we won't play.

2138
02:04:48,700 --> 02:04:50,560
It was so bad!

2139
02:04:51,120 --> 02:04:54,000
So they ended up splitting the 2k.

2140
02:04:59,180 --> 02:05:01,420
That's right, they ended up splitting the 70k.

2141
02:05:01,500 --> 02:05:03,960
Yeah, the 70k ended up getting split.

2142
02:05:05,240 --> 02:05:08,940
Anyway guys, they held everybody hostage.

2143
02:05:09,300 --> 02:05:10,220
It was crazy.

2144
02:05:10,660 --> 02:05:15,320
It was like actual Hunger Games shit with like PETA and Katniss, where there were two winners.

2145
02:05:15,980 --> 02:05:18,360
Anyway guys, I'm gonna call it here.

2146
02:05:18,940 --> 02:05:23,580
I'll see you guys soon on Amelie or Zentreya's stream.

2147
02:05:23,880 --> 02:05:27,620
For those who are new here, I usually stream on the YouTubes.

2148
02:05:27,620 --> 02:05:28,140
So please!

2149
02:05:28,140 --> 02:05:29,320
Check me on YouTube.

2150
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:33,820
I'm usually on Twitch for like, watch-alongs or for like, specific events.

2151
02:05:34,100 --> 02:05:37,640
Like today, where I was doing the Twitch watch-along.

2152
02:05:37,840 --> 02:05:40,640
But like I said, sometimes I am on...

2153
02:05:40,640 --> 02:05:46,000
Sometimes I'm here on Twitch, where like, yeah, but like mostly I'm on YouTube.

2154
02:05:46,280 --> 02:05:52,100
This week I was mostly on Twitch because of the Minecraft Twitch event and also this watch-along.

2155
02:05:52,220 --> 02:05:54,840
I usually do all my watch-alongs here.

2156
02:05:55,640 --> 02:05:56,960
Did I just get raided?

2157
02:05:57,040 --> 02:05:57,540
Oh my god!

2158
02:05:58,800 --> 02:06:00,500
Rosie, thank you for the raid!

2159
02:06:00,700 --> 02:06:04,400
I'm gonna pass it forward because I'm literally about to end.

2160
02:06:04,820 --> 02:06:06,080
But thank you everybody!

2161
02:06:06,180 --> 02:06:09,980
I just finished my watch-along so I was just about to end.

2162
02:06:10,120 --> 02:06:11,540
But thank you for the raid!

2163
02:06:13,860 --> 02:06:15,820
Thank you for the raid, Rosie Bell!

I'll be back on YouTube next week.

2166
02:06:23,860 --> 02:06:26,960
But yeah, I didn't intend to do a whole week of streaming on Twitch.

2167
02:06:27,120 --> 02:06:27,700
But like...

2168
02:06:27,700 --> 02:06:30,880
You know, I didn't intend to be on day four, but it happened.

2169
02:06:31,300 --> 02:06:32,640
For the Minecraft.
