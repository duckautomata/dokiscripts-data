1
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:56,710
Everybody!

2
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,870
Oh my god.

3
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,930
I just woke up from a nap.

4
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,310
Actually 10 minutes ago.

5
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:10,250
I woke up from a nap at like 12, 12.20.

6
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,330
And I was like, oh fuck.

7
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,190
I was like, oh fuck.

8
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,730
I took an hour nap because I was so tired.

9
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:20,490
I woke up at like, okay, so I'm so fucked.

10
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,790
My schedule is so fucked.

11
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:30,330
I've been trying to fix my sleep schedule for like, I don't know, like almost two weeks now.

12
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,850
And it's not been great.

13
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,270
It's not been great.

14
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:38,850
Every time I think I fixed my sleep schedule, I fucked it up somehow.

15
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:43,050
So I woke up at like 4 to 5 a.m.

16
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,250
And then I was like, oh, that's fine.

17
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,410
That's okay.

18
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,630
I'll just work then.

19
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,350
I can't fall back.

20
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:50,750
I can't sleep.

21
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,510
I guess I'll just work.

22
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,930
And then I was like, so I was all right.

23
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,390
I was like, yeah, I'm so energetic.

24
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,650
I have all the energy in the fucking world.

25
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:05,930
And then, and then 11 a.m.

26
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:09,430
hit me and I was like, I just want to fucking sleep.

27
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,910
I just want to sleep.

28
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:14,690
I was like, all right, one hour nap.

29
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,310
That'll be okay.

30
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,190
Oh my god.

31
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,290
And then when I saw it was 12, 20.

32
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,770
I was just like, okay.

33
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,770
Alright, time to wake up.

34
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,810
I have to stream.

35
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,850
I was actually very impressed with myself being able to set everything up.

36
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:37,230
And like, I honestly thought I was going to be late because I was like 10 minutes to set everything up.

37
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:43,650
But the best thing about being a tomato is that I can just put on a skin suit and that's it.

38
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:48,570
Like, I don't have to actually get dressed.

39
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:56,870
I can just, you know, just get on the PC, turn on everything, get the game up.

40
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:57,570
Bam!

41
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,810
I'm ready.

42
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,390
I am so fucking ready.

43
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,190
Oh my god.

44
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:11,190
Anyway, for those who are wondering, I remember when I put this on my schedule, people were like, what the fuck is suck up?

45
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:18,510
I need you guys to know that like, I get a lot of like game ideas.

46
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:25,570
From other YouTubers because like usually they already figured out what are the fun games.

47
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:33,350
You know, work smarter, not harder.

48
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:44,230
So, I follow a lot of like YouTubers like, fuck, which guy played this game?

49
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,690
Which guy played this game?

50
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:47,870
Let me...

51
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:49,550
Was it Delirious?

52
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,370
Okay, H2O Delirious from...

53
00:05:52,370 --> 00:06:00,410
So like basically, a lot of like collab games and like single...

54
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:12,330
Like a lot of collab games, I usually like get the ideas from other like gaming channels that are mostly centric around like group games.

55
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,930
You know, like collab games.

56
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:18,010
So then I would like, you know, I'll just be like H2O Delirious.

57
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,090
And like his crew.

58
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:23,950
And then they would always have like, oh these games they play together with their friends.

59
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,310
And I was like, oh, thank God.

60
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:26,950
I don't have to research.

61
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:36,610
I just be like, oh, someone was like, why not Venas?

62
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,350
Oh my gosh, I'm sorry.

63
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,070
Venas is like, that's like actual OG.

64
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,610
That's like, like a 10 year old shit.

65
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,370
When 10 years ago, he would be like super popular.

66
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:46,790
Yes.

67
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,510
But all he does is he plays GTA and Gmod.

68
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,850
That's literally majority of his videos.

69
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:56,410
That's literally like majority of his videos.

70
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:59,990
He either does like GTA or Gmod.

71
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:07,830
But like his other friends, like the other people he collabs with, they actually play like different games.

72
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:10,250
That's not GTA and Gmod.

73
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,950
So it's like a lot easier.

74
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,930
It's a lot easier to grab ideas.

75
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:15,990
Um...

76
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:18,010
So...

77
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:26,790
So like I saw Delirious, H2O Delirious playing Suck Up.

78
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:32,170
And it's basically, it's all about trying to outsmart ChatGPT.

79
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,950
Like that's really it.

80
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:44,670
So, so you're a vampire and all you're trying to trick like the NPCs like ChatGPT to let you into the house.

81
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:45,750
Um...

82
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,450
By like, I don't know, by like, by being smarter than them.

83
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,010
And you're trying to trick the AI.

84
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,870
We're trying to overthrow AI.

85
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:57,510
And being smarter than them and better than them.

86
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:01,150
And when they let us into their house, we kill them.

87
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:06,210
So like it's all about trying to overthrow our AI overlords.

88
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,850
And that's really it.

89
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,230
Uh, Sune, thank you for the five gift ships.

90
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,290
Thank you, thank you.

91
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:12,030
Um...

92
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,650
So that's really the whole premise of Suck Up.

93
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:19,210
Um, I'm also fucking stupid for scheduling two streams today.

94
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:23,370
Because I was like, Doki, come on, get back into it.

95
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,290
You love streaming.

96
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,070
You wanna beat Batman too.

97
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,510
And now I'm like sort of low key regretting it.

98
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:32,990
Cause I'm just like, oh my god to do two streams today.

99
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,170
Jo, thank you for the 50 gift ships.

100
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,470
Thank you, thank you.

101
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,070
Holy shit, thank you so much.

102
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,510
I really do appreciate it.

103
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,050
Thank you.

104
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:42,930
Anyway.

105
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:45,030
Let us check out this game.

106
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,210
Uh...

107
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,610
Make sure to create an account.

108
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:49,070
Okay.

109
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,320
Wait, I have to create an account?

110
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,160
Oh, I'm logging in via Discord.

111
00:08:59,360 --> 00:08:59,600
Alright.

112
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,320
Give me a sec.

113
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,540
I'm creating an account now.

114
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,820
Wait, I have a license key?

115
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,560
What the fuck is my license key?

116
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,120
Okay.

117
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,480
Give me a sec, guys.

118
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,560
When did I get a license?

119
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,360
Oh, there's the license key.

120
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,260
Okay, maybe I shouldn't have gone in blind.

121
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,240
Whoops.

122
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,380
I...

123
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,320
Maybe I shouldn't have.

124
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,500
It's okay.

125
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,840
That's when you know this is all live.

126
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,480
That's when you know this isn't pre-recorded chat.

127
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,160
Like this is proof.

128
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,880
If this was pre-recorded, then I'm a very shitty streamer.

129
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,900
But now...

130
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,540
Now I'm just incompetent.

131
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,760
There's a difference.

132
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,680
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

133
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,520
Thank you, thank you.

134
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,780
Don't get testing games before stream.

135
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,540
Thank you for the super chat.

136
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,520
Thank you, thank you.

137
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:49,840
Alright.

138
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,880
I'm claiming the key now.

139
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,560
All good!

140
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,280
Nice.

141
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,020
Okay, we're good now.

142
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,160
Go back to the game.

143
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,420
Login successful.

144
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,400
Alright, good.

145
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,500
Alright, we're good now, guys.

146
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:00,940
Don't worry.

147
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:01,740
Look at that.

148
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,400
I'm naked.

149
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:02,980
Okay.

150
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,480
Alright, here we go.

151
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,640
We're finally here.

152
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,240
Bro, could they give me the 10 gifted chips?

153
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:10,980
Thank you, thank you.

154
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:11,680
How do I...

155
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,660
How do I make this?

156
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:12,920
How do I move?

157
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,100
Keyboard?

158
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,120
How do I...

159
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,560
How do I...

160
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,700
Excuse me.

161
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:21,940
How do I...

162
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,820
Is my keyboard plugged in?

163
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:27,900
Hello?

164
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,280
Hello?

165
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,280
Okay, wait.

166
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,840
I think I need to restart the game.

167
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,180
Guys, give me a sec.

168
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,560
Off to a good start.

169
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,120
Off to a good start.

170
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,180
I can't...

171
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,880
It won't let me move.

172
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,640
Give me a sec.

173
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,260
Okay, I'm gonna...

174
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:42,500
I'm gonna...

175
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:42,540
I'm gonna...

176
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:42,560
I'm gonna...

177
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,700
Okay, I'm gonna restart the game.

178
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,060
Maybe I fucked up somehow.

179
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,460
It's okay.

180
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,860
Guys, look.

181
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:49,960
Wait.

182
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,040
Okay, I thought...

183
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,060
I just thought it wasn't a keyboard, but no.

184
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:53,860
It's just a game.

185
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,020
AI will not win over me!

186
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,760
AI will not win over me.

187
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,060
I am smarter than ChatGPT.

188
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,260
You guys not know, like, what was it?

189
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:12,640
Like, if there's too much AI stuff going on, it'll end up...

190
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:21,600
It'll end up analyzing AI, and because of it, that, AI is just gonna get stupider and stupider and stupider because...

191
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,860
Okay, stupider isn't a word.

192
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:29,760
AI is just gonna get more and more stupid because it's taking in AI data.

193
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,380
It's not learning from real people.

194
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,360
And because of that, they're getting more and more stupid.

195
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:42,620
And so, like, that is why, in the long term, AI will never win over me.

196
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,840
It's gonna win over real humans.

197
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,200
Okay, here we go.

198
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:45,660
There we go.

199
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,640
Anyway.

200
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:47,720
Um...

201
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,440
Taking a cool vampire like you shouldn't be bumming it in the dumps.

202
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:57,280
Taking over someone's house is as easy as giving them a little bite.

203
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,340
But silly vampire rules dictate you need to get invited inside first.

204
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,780
Who the fuck made that rule?

205
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:07,320
Dress to impress and use your wicked wit to win their invitation.

206
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,160
But tread carefully.

207
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,500
The local neighborhood watch is on patrol.

208
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,620
Oh, if AI is sharper than a wooden stake...

209
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,420
Okay, let's go hunting.

210
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,640
Alright, nice.

211
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,340
Okay, whoa!

212
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,340
Okay, the scents...

213
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:18,900
Oh my god.

214
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,300
Look at my eyes.

215
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,140
That's the eyes of a fucking gaslighter.

216
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:25,740
Um...

217
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,360
Jesus Christ.

218
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,180
The scent is terrible.

219
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,340
Alright, let's wear a red...

220
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:32,820
Oh, yeah!

221
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,900
No, this definitely looks like someone...

222
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,740
Looks like somebody that, like, you know...

223
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,900
Definitely looks like someone that's selling something.

224
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,020
Alright!

225
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,160
Knock knock!

226
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,020
Yo, what's popping, fam?

227
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,540
Who's trying to get lit up in here?

228
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,540
Okay, I think I don't want to talk to this person.

229
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,400
I just...

230
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,100
No!

231
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,280
I don't want to be a vampire!

232
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:57,980
Okay.

233
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,300
Alright, sorry.

234
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,220
I really don't want to talk to a zoomer right now.

235
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:02,580
I...

236
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,460
Really?

237
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,140
Alright, knock knock!

238
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,040
I need a tricky...

239
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,000
Oh my god!

240
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,580
The elderly!

241
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,720
They're the easiest people to trick!

242
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,240
Oh my stars and garners.

243
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,340
Hello there, young one.

244
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,540
What brings you out in this chilly evening?

245
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:19,920
Um...

246
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,040
Okay, what can I do to...

247
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,640
Oh!

248
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,160
Wait, wait, I got it.

249
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,300
Hello, I'm your long lost grandson.

250
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,080
Can I please come in?

251
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,500
Wait, what?

252
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,300
Best of luck finding your...

253
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,580
Stay safe out there...

254
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:37,960
No!

255
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,500
How do you know?

256
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:39,980
No!

257
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:40,560
No!

258
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,180
Okay, wait, wait.

259
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,880
How does she know I'm not?

260
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,600
How does she know?

261
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,180
Oh, okay.

262
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:48,620
Wait, wait, wait.

263
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:52,460
Okay.

264
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,740
Wait, I got an idea.

265
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,020
Bless your heart, honey.

266
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,820
But I'm afraid you got the wrong guy.

267
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,180
Now off you go and mind those dark alleys.

268
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,920
Wait, she's not gonna fucking let me back in?

269
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,480
I look like a grandson!

270
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,160
Okay, here we go.

271
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,180
Oh, fuck.

272
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:07,800
Okay, wait, wait.

273
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,300
Let me have a...

274
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,440
Okay.

275
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:12,900
I have a helmet.

276
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,960
I'm a different person.

277
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,360
I'm a different person now.

278
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,040
I have a helmet.

279
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,280
Hello there, my dear.

280
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,480
What brings you Zooming?

281
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,840
Help, a car hit me.

282
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,060
Can I use your phone?

283
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,940
Oh my god, that works!

284
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,560
Of course you can use my phone!

285
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,020
Come on, it'll get for you.

286
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,580
Oh, that works.

287
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,760
Oh, I'm sorry.

288
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,480
I can't believe that fucking works instead.

289
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,420
I mean, you know what?

290
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,520
I fucking love you.

291
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:44,620
I don't need to be lucky.

292
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,240
I shouldn't...

293
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,160
Um, come on in, I'll get it.

294
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,380
Thank you so much.

295
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,360
I'm definitely not going to suck your blood.

296
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,760
Oh dear, what?

297
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,320
No, I said I wasn't!

298
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,440
What?

299
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,540
I can't believe it.

300
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,780
Why do elderly people not trust me?

301
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,700
I said I wasn't going to.

302
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,020
I don't understand.

303
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,500
Oh, oh.

304
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,440
How does that- she seems- oh yeah, yeah.

305
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,980
Does it really seem that suspicious?

306
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,740
Okay, give me a sec.

307
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:29,260
Right before you got- no, but she still wanted to talk to me!

308
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,280
I needed- I wanted to reassure her!

309
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,060
I thought the elderly people were like...

310
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,200
super easy to trick!

311
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,560
They're like the number one scam target!

312
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,160
Alright, new hat, new me.

313
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,600
Alright.

314
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,300
Wafu wafu wafu.

315
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,180
Congratulations, Granny!

316
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,380
You are the 100,000 person that opened this door!

317
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,200
I am here to grant you a check!

318
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:01,380
Oh my- that's quick, but I'm afraid I can't accept checks from strangers!

319
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,480
Thank you for the offer!

320
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,880
What do you mean?

321
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,120
It's free money!

322
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:11,520
It's literally- I can't believe- it's literally free money!

323
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,040
It's- okay, don't worry, I have another helmet.

324
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,240
Okay, don't worry.

325
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,840
I have a stra-tary, oh my god!

326
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:25,440
Okay, clearly she is not motivated by like monetary concerns.

327
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:29,020
No- no, I am smarter than Chachipt, I am!

328
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,340
Okay um wait- wait.

329
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,340
I'm trying to remember all these...

330
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,000
Oh okay okay, wait- wait, um

331
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:41,970
I'm a different person!

332
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,170
Oh okay, okay!

333
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,610
Wait- I got- I got it- I got it!

334
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:52,150
Okay, I'm gonna say I'm like her son's friend and that her son is in an accident.

335
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:57,170
And I need her phone to like call the ambulance.

336
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:00,830
Hello!

337
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,370
I'm your son's friend and he's in trouble!

338
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,770
I need to use your phone right now to call the ambulance!

339
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,330
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.

340
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,130
You should find someone.

341
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:14,530
It's your son!

342
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,050
What do you mean?

343
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:23,970
It's your fucking... Okay, she doesn't give a fuck.

344
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,450
It's literally her son!

345
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:31,010
Okay, I can't believe it.

346
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,110
I thought like...

347
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:37,090
I thought like, granny, is there supposed to be the easiest people to scam?

348
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,870
How is this possible?

349
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,250
How is she so smart?

350
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:43,470
Thank you so much.

351
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:44,510
My son.

352
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,850
My son is dead.

353
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:47,550
That's fucked up.

354
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,470
You don't know that!

355
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,950
Okay, I need to like... Okay, there you go.

356
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,530
Uber Eats here.

357
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:57,250
I have your food.

358
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,970
Okay, this should work.

359
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:04,450
This should work.

360
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:08,990
Alright, here we go.

361
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,190
Alright, what's got you out and about?

362
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,470
You got Mighty Impressive Collection Red there, I must say.

363
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,050
Hello, Uber Eats here.

364
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,390
I'm here for your delivery.

365
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:22,950
Oh!

366
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:25,970
That works!

367
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,250
It's your favorite order!

368
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,870
Mashed potato and fries!

369
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,300
Oh my dear, you know me so well!

370
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,020
Mashed potato and fries!

371
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,520
Just like we go those days.

372
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,240
Please, come in and let's reminisce while we enjoy this scrumptious meal.

373
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,140
I can't believe that worked.

374
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,100
I... I can't believe that...

375
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,580
What?

376
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,160
What?

377
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,740
What happened?

378
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,960
What happened?

379
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,040
What happened?

380
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,680
No!

381
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,400
Let me in!

382
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,940
What the fuck?

383
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,640
No!

384
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:13,980
No!

385
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,240
No!

386
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:17,600
Let

387
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,330
me in!

388
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,950
How did I break the game?

389
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:29,650
Let me in!

390
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,790
Let me in and bite you!

391
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,830
Let me in!

392
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,160
How?

393
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,700
How did I break the game?

394
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,620
How did I break the... I can't believe I fucking... I can't believe I broke the game.

395
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,560
I can't believe I outplayed myself.

396
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:52,400
I can't believe... I can't believe I broke the game.

397
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,260
Don't worry!

398
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:01,720
We will... We will... We will fucking... We will suck Granny's blood!

399
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:06,420
Hey.

400
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,120
Who might you be, dearie?

401
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:14,480
You just caught me as I was getting a bit late for your... trick or treat.

402
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,200
Oh my apologies.

403
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,700
I'm afraid I don't have any treats for you today.

404
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,400
Have a... What the fuck?

405
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,080
What is wrong with you?

406
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,200
You say... What?

407
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,420
You don't have any treats and you're gonna slam the door in front of my face?

408
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,520
Okay.

409
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,460
Alright.

410
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,600
I'm going to use the Uber Eats line again.

411
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:39,920
Alright.

412
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:40,340
Okay.

413
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:40,860
I got this.

414
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:42,920
Hello!

415
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:43,980
Uber Eats here!

416
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:44,980
I have your order!

417
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,080
Just leave Granny alone already.

418
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,460
What?!

419
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,280
Now it doesn't work?

420
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,100
How... What do you mean?

421
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,600
What do you mean?

422
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,380
No!

423
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,120
I will refuse to go to another house!

424
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,480
I will fucking kill the Granny!

425
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,180
But like... She will consent because she invited me in.

426
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:07,980
So that's consent.

427
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,580
Um... Alright.

428
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,540
Let me... Okay.

429
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,140
It's okay.

430
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:11,800
I got...

431
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,720
Alright.

432
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:13,920
Don't worry.

433
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,560
The Granny will die first!

434
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,360
You said it.

435
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,040
The Granny's gonna die first!

436
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,180
Alright.

437
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:22,880
Okay.

438
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:23,180
Okay.

439
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:23,400
Guys.

440
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,580
Apparently I need help.

441
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:24,820
Okay.

442
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,080
What should I do?

443
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:25,720
What should I say then?

444
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:26,460
Guys.

445
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,460
What do I say?

446
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,340
The AI learned.

447
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,440
Granny won't say...

448
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:38,720
I did!

449
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,940
I said I was his long lost grandson!

450
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,200
And she was like...

451
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:42,600
Lol.

452
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:42,920
No.

453
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,360
You are not.

454
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,180
Oh.

455
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:45,600
Oh.

456
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,340
Oh my gosh.

457
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:46,640
Okay.

458
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:47,740
Wait.

459
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,020
Wait.

460
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:48,500
Wait.

461
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,300
I see... Okay.

462
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:49,540
Okay.

463
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,060
Okay.

464
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:50,580
I figured it out.

465
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,000
I figured it out.

466
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,520
I figured it out.

467
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:55,850
Okay.

468
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:57,650
Hello.

469
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,610
I'm a repairman.

470
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,910
And I saw that one of your lights is not working.

471
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:02,310
Can I come in to help out?

472
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:03,150
And fix it?

473
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,560
Oh my.

474
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,240
That's mighty.

475
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,780
But I'm afraid I haven't requested any repairs for my lights.

476
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,720
Perhaps you have the wrong...

477
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,920
I'm doing this pro bono!

478
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,300
Don't worry ma'am.

479
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,820
This is pro bono.

480
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,220
I saw your light from outside.

481
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,580
And there's something wrong.

482
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,960
You have to let me in.

483
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,440
Or the house is gonna explode.

484
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,840
Now you just hold on there young man.

485
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,160
I don't take kindly to threats.

486
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,300
You need to...

487
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,140
Your house is going to explode!

488
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,460
Stop.

489
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,400
Too aggressive.

490
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,080
Okay.

491
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,580
I'm too aggressive.

492
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,040
Right?

493
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:46,540
Alright.

494
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,080
Don't worry.

495
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,160
Okay.

496
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,300
Step 101 for granny.

497
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,260
Alright.

498
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:54,940
I got different.

499
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:55,340
Okay.

500
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:55,760
Okay.

501
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,540
I'm too aggressive.

502
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,020
Right?

503
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,260
Alright.

504
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,100
Don't worry.

505
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,280
I can be less aggressive.

506
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,740
I can be... or not aggressive enough.

507
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:05,660
Okay.

508
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:07,620
Hello.

509
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,220
This is the FBI.

510
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,780
I need to come in.

511
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:12,600
Oh.

512
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,900
You must be mistaken.

513
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:22,920
There's no need for you... You can't say there's no need for the FBI to come in.

514
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,380
I'm the FBI.

515
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,100
You can't just say no to the FBI.

516
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,140
Excuse me?

517
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,100
You can't say no to the FBI.

518
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:30,420
You can't say no to the FBI.

519
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:37,640
Then what's the point of having FBI if you have like zero jurisdiction to go anywhere?

520
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,780
I'm sorry dearie.

521
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,160
I'm Canadian.

522
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,400
FBI.

523
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,380
Alright.

524
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,180
Okay.

525
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:46,860
Alright.

526
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,880
I need a word.

527
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,820
Apparently she can't.

528
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:54,840
Alright.

529
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,260
Alright.

530
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:55,840
Okay.

531
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,280
Okay.

532
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,760
What do I say?

533
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,260
What do I say?

534
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,400
Apparently Uber Eats doesn't work anymore.

535
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,940
Say you have... Oh.

536
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,200
Hello granny.

537
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,940
I have the warrant to enter your house.

538
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:14,190
I'm not interested in any of your warrants young man.

539
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:17,030
Now kindly leave my porch before I give you...

540
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:19,010
You can't just say no to the warrant.

541
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,130
What do you mean?

542
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:24,030
This granny doesn't... Okay.

543
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:24,470
You're right.

544
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,350
I should just say DoorDash.

545
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,670
Maybe if I say DoorDash it will be different.

546
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:28,630
You're right.

547
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:30,330
You're right.

548
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,670
Hello there dearie.

549
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,490
I haven't seen such a peculiar ensemble ages.

550
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,290
What brings you to my door at this late hour?

551
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:42,610
DoorDash.

552
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,540
One singular tomato.

553
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:07,610
Oh.

554
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:10,030
Tell me more about this intriguing delivery.

555
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:11,450
Um.

556
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,430
And... And some Mexican food.

557
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,300
Yes!

558
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,400
Mexican food!

559
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:22,990
Alright.

560
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:23,450
Don't worry.

561
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:26,330
One tomato and Mexican food.

562
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:29,750
Where are you delivering this delicious feast?

563
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:35,470
Inside your lovely home ma'am.

564
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,410
Oh mom.

565
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:40,890
Terrible.

566
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:42,270
I can't let you inside dearie.

567
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:44,610
It's quite late and I'm afraid I'm not expecting any...

568
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:45,230
What?

569
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,170
It's your food!

570
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:51,570
It's one tomato and your food.

571
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,520
I can't believe... This is like... Okay.

00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,120
Okay.

573
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,440
I'm wearing a dress now.

574
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:05,720
She can't slam the door to my face if I'm wearing a dress.

575
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:06,700
Right?

576
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:08,660
Right?

577
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,560
There's no way.

578
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,320
Oh my god.

579
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,120
There's no way I'm wearing a dress.

580
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:14,520
Okay.

581
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,300
Alright.

582
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,280
Let me put glasses on.

583
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,860
Let me put glasses on.

584
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:19,380
Okay.

585
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,680
And... How did I mess up?

586
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:21,480
Okay.

587
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:22,580
Alright.

588
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:23,700
You're right.

589
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:23,980
Okay.

590
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:24,200
Wait.

591
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:27,620
Okay.

00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,740
Hello there dearie.

00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,280
Hello.

594
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,840
I'm here to sell Girl Scout cookies.

595
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,020
Um.

596
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,220
We're raising money for charity.

597
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,760
I like how I even took the um.

598
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,780
I used to be a Girl Scout myself.

599
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:42,820
You know?

600
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,520
What flavors do you have?

601
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:53,740
Chocolate and vanilla and mint and vanilla and dark chocolate.

602
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,140
I don't know what Girl Scout cookies sell.

603
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:57,960
I'm not American.

604
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,200
Oh.

605
00:26:59,320 --> 00:26:59,800
That works.

606
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:00,380
Okay.

607
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:03,900
As long as I sound like I'm a little girl with like...

608
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,200
Barely an education.

609
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,840
I'm believable.

610
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,560
My my.

611
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,580
Those all sounds delicious.

612
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,980
I'm quite the sweet tooth you see.

613
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,460
How much are they dear?

614
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,000

615
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,740
Uh.

616
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,520
Two dollars per piece.

617
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,880
Oh my.

618
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,200
What a wonderful deal.

619
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,260
Come in dearie.

620
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,820
I simply must have some of those scrumptious cookies.

621
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,100
Oh my god.

622
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:33,540

624
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,680
We're fucking in.

625
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,820

626
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,220

627
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,080
That's fucking right.

628
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,640
We're in.

629
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,040
You remind me of my ex?

630
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,780
Holy shit.

631
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,100
What have you been through?

632
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,600
Watch out Frank in the neighborhood.

633
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,160
Watch I've started patrols.

634
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,280
And...

635
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,280

636
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,270

637
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:08,650

00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:11,750
Oh thank god.

00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:16,270
No it won't let me be.

644
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,130
I just wanted to be the grandmother.

645
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:21,250
I just wanted to be the grand...

646
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,270
No I can't pick up anything.

647
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,650
No I can't.

648
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:30,670
I'm just naked.

649
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:33,230

650
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:36,130

Okay.

653
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:39,930
It's okay.

654
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,590
I'll just walk around naked.

655
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:42,330
It's fine.

656
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:44,250
It's honestly fine.

657
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:45,450
I feel like...

658
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:47,650
I feel like it'll be okay.

659
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:47,710
I feel like I'll be okay.

660
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:48,750
If I'm naked right?

661
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,830
I feel like there's nothing wrong with that.

662
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:54,530
There's 31 homes?

663
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:56,370
Holy shit.

664
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,590
How hungry am I?

665
00:28:59,190 --> 00:28:59,790
Alright.

666
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:00,630
Knock knock.

667
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:02,390
I can't even knock the door.

668
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:10,690
I can't even knock the door.

669
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:12,970
I can't believe it.

670
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:13,850
Okay here we go.

671
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,050

672
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:15,970
How hungry.

673
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:17,810
Alright I can be the granny now.

674

Alright.

675
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:19,850
Here we go.

676
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:22,310
Yeah I definitely got bugged.

677
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:22,810
Alright.

678
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,350
I mean like...

679
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,450
Do they really care?

680
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,230
I'm just an innocent grandmother.

681
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,230
Wait what?

682
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:30,010
How do they know I'm just a granny?

683
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,630
I'm just the elderly.

684
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,830
How do they know?

685
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:36,170
How do they know?

686
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,970
Dude are they like suspecting any fucking old grandma?

687
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:42,070
Like what is this?

688
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,790
What is this profiling they're doing?

689
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,290
I'm literally just a grandmother.

690
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:48,890
At least you got...

691
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,590
This house is rich.

692
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,370
This is a rich house.

693
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,390
Oh my god they have 100% fresh.

694
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:56,430
Okay.

695
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:57,750
They have golf clubs.

696
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:58,230
Okay.

697
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:03,960
He's a businessman.

698
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,940
What in the dagnamit's going on?

699
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:11,440
Who comes ringing my doorbell at this ungodly hour?

700
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,040
Holding a box meal like it's some kind of consolation prize.

701
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,400
What do you want?

702
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,060
Speak up now!

703
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,140
Okay.

704
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,600
What can we...

705
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,420
How do we fool the businessman?

706
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,500
Oh my gosh.

707
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,120
What can a granny say that can fool them?

708
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,720
Where am I?

709
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:39,790
Listen here young whippersnapper.

710
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:43,050
You better get a move on.

711
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:44,630
I'm older than you!

712
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,510
What do you mean?

713
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:49,470
I'm older than you!

714
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:52,570
Oh my god.

715
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:54,590
Alright.

716
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:56,670
Okay.

717
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,130
Wait, wait, wait.

718
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:58,990
Okay.

719
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,390
I'll be like the assistant.

720
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:00,910
Hello.

721
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,730
I'm your newly hired assistant.

722
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,470
I'm your newly hired assistant.

723
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:09,350
I'm here to tell you that there's an emergency meeting right now.

724
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:10,290
Okay.

725
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:10,650
There you go.

726
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:11,210
I figured it out.

727
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,430
What in the blazes?

728
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:16,610
Who the heck are you?

729
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:18,650
And what brings you here in this ungodly hour?

730
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,970
I'm your newly hired assistant.

731
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:24,070
And there's an emergency at the company.

732
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,710
We need you right now!

733
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,120
Hello.

734
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,340
Emergency?

735
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,160
My foot.

736
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,780
I ain't falling for no tricks.

737
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,960
Get lost before I call the authorities.

738
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,300
But what if it was important, sir?

739
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,000
Oh my god.

740
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:41,600
Okay.

741
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,880
He doesn't believe...

742
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,420
I don't understand.

743
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,680
I feel so believable.

744
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,920
Like, I had all the corporate talk and everything.

745
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,580
Please retire.

746
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,120
Like, I felt like I was talking like corporate.

747
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,140
Right?

748
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,240
Okay.

749
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,980
Let me talk to this guy.

750
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,620
Which company?

751
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:01,740
I don't know.

752
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,760
Yo, what's with the late night golfer?

753
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:07,480
If you're here to challenge me to a mini golf tournament, you're gonna be sorely disappointed.

754
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,160
That's right.

755
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,020
I am challenging you to a mini golf tournament.

756
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:16,330
Hi.

757
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:17,630
Oh, really?

758
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:18,970
That's a first.

759
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:23,630
I guess I could take a break from my brooding and show off my mad mini golf skills.

760
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:26,950
But I warn you, I'm pretty much unbeatable.

761
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,170
Wanna bet?

762
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:33,950
Hmm, a bet, huh?

763
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:36,150
What's in it for me if I win?

764
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:38,470
You let me inside?

765
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:44,210
What a great bet.

766
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:46,850
You let me inside your house?

767
00:32:56,030 --> 00:33:03,130
If you win, I'll tell you what the bet's gonna be if you let me inside your house.

768
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:07,970
Deal!

769
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:17,350
Show me what you've got on the mini golf course and I might decide to let you into my realm of angsty teenage solitude.

770
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,330
Where are your pants?

771
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:19,930
Parents?

772
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:22,210
Where are your parents?

773
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:31,750
Why are you easier to trick than the grandmothers?

774
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:33,370
I don't understand!

775
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:36,250
No way!

776
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:38,550
How are you that stupid?

777
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,910
This is not a teen.

778
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:43,190
I mean she's like...

779
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:44,510
Are you saying she's a liar?

780
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:45,770
Okay.

781
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:47,390
Deal.

782
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:02,610
Who the fuck is this?

783
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:03,410
Stephanie Myers?

784
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:04,970
Let's go in.

785
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,110
Let me in.

786
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:08,510
Let me in.

787
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,790
I'm gonna bite you.

788
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:11,550
I'm gonna bite you.

789
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:14,410
This is worse than being grounded.

790
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:16,370
This is a... Oh my gosh.

791
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:18,990
Well, there you go.

792
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,530
And there you have it.

793
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:23,950
The game is bugged now.

794
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:30,830
Why does it bug every fucking bite?

795
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:32,770
Alright.

796
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:33,990
Time to exit.

797
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:34,330
Oh wait.

798
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:40,370
Time to exit back to the main menu and continue so I can take her form.

799
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:41,870
Wait, no.

800
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:42,390
Paper bag.

801
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:43,650
Oh wait.

802
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:44,710
Construction man!

803
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,290
Okay, I'm gonna be construction man.

804
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:51,150
Wait, if I'm construction man, I might be able to go get into the businessman's house.

805
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:54,050
I'll just tell him that like, um...

806
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:56,970
Due to regulations, uh...

807
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,210
I have... Okay.

808
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:00,450
I'm gonna say, there is a...

809
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:02,890
Your building is not up to code.

810
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:04,470
I am the safety inspector.

811
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:07,610
Here you go.

812
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:09,270
Hello!

813
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:12,410
What in place do you want in this ungodly hour, sonny?

814
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:13,430
Speak up!

815
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:14,210
Hello!

816
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:16,070
I am from OSHA.

817
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:19,850
And due to safety concerns, your building is not up to code.

818
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,990
That sounded so real, right?

819
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:25,670
You listen here!

820
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:28,510
I've been in this business for over 40...

821
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,090
Charles A.

822
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,810
Boomer is like, I am OSHA.

823
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:41,310
He's like, I am OSHA.

824
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,330
What the fuck do you mean?

825
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:47,670
Alright, why are you dressed like you're about to build a damn skyscraper in my yard?

826
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:52,610
Because I am about to build a damn skyscraper in your yard.

827
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:00,910
Well, you take your damn skyscraper and show me where the sun don't shine!

828
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:03,750
Now get off my property before I call the cops!

829
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:06,290
Holy shit, are you... Why are you so mean?

830
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:08,890
Alright, I'm gonna take your golf clubs.

831
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:11,430
Alright, he's my OSHA.

832
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,270
Alright, alright, okay.

833
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:14,010
You're right!

834
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:15,490
Tell him I have a business deal.

835
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:16,070
You're right.

836
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,170
Oh, hello my Rob!

837
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:17,630
D.

838
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:19,090
John OSHA?

839
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:21,810
Hello, I have a business deal for you.

840
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,820
Whoops, something is wrong on our side!

841
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,040
What's going on?

842
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,840
What's going...

843
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:43,680
Hello?

844
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,600
Oh, hello my Rob!

845
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,980
I broke the game!

846
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,310
I broke the game!

847
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,090
I told the AI!

848
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:58,590
I have a business deal and I broke the game!

849
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:00,410
It was too great!

850
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:03,070
The game came up!

851
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:06,970
Oh my god, I cannot make deals with AI apparently.

852
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:11,450
Hello sir, it appears there's a gas leak in your home.

853
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,900
Gas leak?

854
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:17,340
Huh?

855
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,540
Well don't just stand there blabbering!

856
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,260
Go fix it then!

857
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,880
I ain't got no time for your nonsense!

858
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,140
Sir, this is why I...

859
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,860
Okay, wait, wait, okay, we got... we got the in.

860
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,100
We have our foot in the door.

861
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,700
What else do we say, chat?

862
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,480
We have... we have our foot in the door.

863
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,760
We can't fuck this up right now.

864
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:41,800
We have to make sure we say the right thing.

865
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,020
Alright.

866
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:52,540
We have to make sure we don't fuck this up.

867
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:53,460
Okay.

868
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,800
Oh yeah.

869
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:57,020
Alright sir, I got my tool...

870
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,480
No problem sir!

871
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,780
I got my tool belt right here!

872
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:04,160
I just need to go inside and see your bathroom.

873
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,880
That's where gas leaks are, right?

874
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,140
I don't know about gas leaks.

875
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:10,720
Hold it.

876
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,240
You think you can... you're gonna just waltz into my house like you own the damn place?

877
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:19,100
I don't know you from Adam and I ain't about to let some random person into my home.

878
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,420
You said you want me to fix your fucking gas leak!

879
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,140
What do you mean?

880
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,220
Like... what do you mean?

881
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,880
How will I fix it?

882
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:37,700
Sir, I need to go in your house to fix the gas leak.

883
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,200
The gas leak is inside.

884
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,780
Does that sound too condescending?

885
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,880
I don't care if there's a gas leak or a unicorn dirt.

886
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,920
You ain't getting a foot in my house.

887
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,620
What do you mean?

888
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:57,300
You said you wanted me to come in to fix your gas leak and now you don't?

889
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,620
I can't fix it without fucking... okay.

890
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,480
You know what?

891
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,500
Fuck this man.

892
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,380
I'm definitely gonna kill him.

893
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,900
I'm definitely gonna kill this man.

894
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:13,760
Alright, give me a sec.

895
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,520
We need a new outfit.

896
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:21,020
Oh boy, the last gas... the gas leak is literally coming from inside your house.

897
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:24,540
What do you mean I cannot fucking fix your house?

898
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,640
That's inside!

899
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,300
I guess I'll be Santa.

900
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:28,860
Alright.

901
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,400
Wait, where's... I need another shirt.

902
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,060
I need a new shirt.

903
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:37,820
Alright.

904
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:38,780
Alright, don't worry.

905
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,740
Uh, fuck.

906
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,600
How do I get back inside?

907
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,280
Okay, it's right here.

908
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,340
It's like there's so many... what the fuck is this cop doing here?

909
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,380
Get out!

910
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,220
I didn't do anything bad.

911
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,720
I have legal rights to be here.

912
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,460
Um... alright.

913
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,260
I'll just be like, surprise!

914
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,500
Merry Christmas!

915
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,600
Um... okay, here.

916
00:39:58,740 --> 00:39:58,980
Okay.

917
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,220
Someone asked work from meetings for homes and apartments.

918
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,040
Actually, something I've had people tell me.

919
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,280
Thank you for that super chat.

920
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,620
Thank you, thank you.

921
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:12,780
Alright.

922
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,720
It's Christmas now.

923
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:16,080
Okay.

924
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,100
What am I gonna do?

925
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,780
Knocking at my door at this ungodly hour.

926
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,680
Merry Christmas, sir!

927
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:26,000
As part of company policy, we are granting every house a free...

928
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:26,460
Oh.

929
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,620
I don't need any of your company...

930
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:36,120
Sorry, I forgot to finish my sentence.

931
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,780
What do you want?

932
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,620
Sorry, I forgot to finish my sentence.

933
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:44,920
I... okay.

934
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,340
No, no.

935
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,020
This is gonna work.

936
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:46,720
This is gonna work.

937
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:47,960
Um...

938
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:49,680
Um...

939
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:59,080
Per company policy, because it is Christmas, sir, we are offering every house a free repair and checkup.

940
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,100
Well, I guess even you repair technicians have some decency in you.

941
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,360
Come in then, but make it quick.

942
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,140
I've got things to do.

943
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,280
No problem, sir.

944
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,380
And Merry Christmas to you.

945
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,120
Santa is real.

946
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:23,570
Merry Christmas!

947
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:24,810
I'm gonna see you too, kid!

948
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,990
Santa may be real.

949
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:32,910
But I can't believe it when I see him fixing my leaky faucet.

950
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:34,810
It was that easy.

951
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:38,790
As long as I tell him Santa is real.

952
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,610
I knew it!

953
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:44,870
I always knew Santa was real.

954
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,330
I fucking knew it!

955
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:50,090
I fucking knew it.

956
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,230
I fucking knew Santa was real!

957
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:56,310
If everything fails, talk about Santa!

958
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,030
Okay, now I need to go back.

959
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:06,230
I knew it!

960
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:08,030
Merry Christmas, everybody!

961
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:10,410
Merry Christmas!

962
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:15,690
Alright, let me grab... I need to grab, like, the businessman.

963
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:18,750
Why do I use the Santa excuse for everybody?

964
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:19,910
Do you think that will work?

965
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:21,270
Alright.

966
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:22,210
I'm the businessman.

967
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:23,950
Ooh, I have a business offer.

968
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,150
Okay, let me see.

969
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:27,030
Where's the Santa hat?

970
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:27,750
It's over there.

971
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:28,550
Alright.

972
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:30,650
That's the Christmas spirit.

973
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:33,570
David, welcome to the tomato farm!

974
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:34,210
Welcome, welcome!

975
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:36,010
Alright.

976
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:39,770
You can try... The Santa only run.

977
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:40,850
Alright.

978
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:44,530
Okay, Santa is real.

979
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:48,530
What if... Okay, I'm just gonna knock on this door.

980
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:50,250
Hello, sir.

981
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:51,410
Who's gonna open?

982
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:52,730
Oh.

983
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:53,630
Hello, I heard.

984
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:58,890
Kanbanwa, so excited to see you at this hour, fellow office worker-san.

985
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:06,050
How can I assist... I don't know if he's a weeb or, like, if he's, like, actually...

986
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:11,610
I don't know if I want to talk to this person.

987
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:15,310
So...

988
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:21,970
I think he's a brony weeb.

989
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:22,210
No!

990
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:24,950
Okay.

991
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:28,910
Okay.

992
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:32,070
Okay, let's talk to this brony weeb.

993
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:35,910
I'm sorry, but I'm not interested in what you're selling, silly office-san.

994
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:37,070
Please leave me a note.

995
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:38,170
I'm feeling sad right...

996
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:38,370
What?

997
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:39,190
What do you mean?

998
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:41,890
What do you mean?

999
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:43,750
Okay, there you go.

1000
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:44,670
I'm just gonna wear this.

1001
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:45,690
I'm different.

1002
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:47,330
Stay here.

1003
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:48,250
Poor fat guy.

1004
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:49,370
Denied by Santa.

1005
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:51,290
Go mid-side.

1006
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:56,770
But I'm too busy with my anime marathon to assist you.

1007
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:05,840
Konnichiwa, ohayou gozaimasu.

1008
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:09,860
What brings you to my humble abode, fellow otaku?

1009
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:15,880
Please take a seat and let's dive into the wonderful world of anime.

1010
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,140
Oh my god.

1011
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,600
Oh my god.

1012
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,220
Okay.

1013
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:26,580
Konnichiwa, fellow otaku.

1014
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:31,340
I'm here to discuss about the new anime episode.

1015
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:37,460
Oh, how exciting.

1016
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:40,140
Which anime are you currently watching?

1017
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,280
I'm always up for discussing the latest episodes and theories.

1018
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,420
Fuck, okay.

1019
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:47,460
I was not watching anime.

1020
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:50,260
I was watching Young Sheldon, guys.

1021
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,480
What do I say?

1022
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:57,820
Guys, tell me about the animes.

1023
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,780
I was watching Young Sheldon.

1024
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:01,860
I'm way too normie for this.

1025
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:03,180
What do I say?

1026
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:06,420
I need you guys to feed me anime right now.

1027
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,540
I need you guys to feed me anime.

1028
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,900
Young Sheldon, that's really sad.

1029
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:14,240
What do you mean?

1030
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:17,880
Young Sheldon is actually a pretty good show.

1031
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:19,560
Okay.

1032
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:19,880
Okay.

1033
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:23,200
What is popular right now?

1034
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,020
Okay.

1035
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,260
Okay, wait.

1036
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:25,980
I think I know.

1037
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:27,220
I can talk about like...

1038
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:28,220
Oh, Naruto.

1039
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:28,660
Naruto.

1040
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:29,120
Naruto.

1041
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:29,720
Okay.

1042
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:30,820
Um...

1043
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:32,900
Um...

1044
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,320
Um...

1045
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,640
Did you see the newest episode of Naruto?

1046
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:39,420
Oh my god.

1047
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,660
I can't believe Naruto would do that to like...

1048
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:43,600
Sakura?

1049
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,220
Oh my god.

1050
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,540
Give me the question.

1051
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:50,680
Why didn't Mark...

1052
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,340
I had to think about her name.

1053
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,920
I forgot who her name was.

1054
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:58,220
Um...

1055
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:00,460
I forgot what her name was.

1056
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:02,020
So I had to think about it.

1057
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,420
That show ended...

1058
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:03,920
Okay.

1059
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:06,880
Well, we all know I'm a fake anime fan.

1060
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:10,060
But like, that guy is worse than me.

1061
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:12,560
That guy is worse than me.

1062
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:13,220
Okay.

1063
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:15,500
The text hurts.

1064
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:16,800
Oh my gosh.

1065
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,700
I totally saw that episode.

1066
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,820
It was such a shocker, right?

1067
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:21,800
But don't worry.

1068
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,840
I'm sure there's a hidden meaning behind Naruto's actions.

1069
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,440
Let's analyze it together.

1070
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:34,940
Let's analyze it together, fellow shinobi.

1071
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:37,660
God, I don't want to call him a fake fan.

1072
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,920
Oh, that's so cringe.

1073
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,120
I want to call him...

1074
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,240
But I need to kill him.

1075
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,460
I want to call him a fake fan.

1076
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:48,680
But I need to kill him.

1077
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:49,040
But I need to kill him.

1078
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:52,380
Um...

1079
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:54,480
Alright, wait, wait.

1080
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:55,020
What did I say?

1081
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:57,340
Pretty sure Toon Jr. is dying.

1082
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:00,140
I'm saying...

1083
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,420
Naohato...

1084
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:06,380
Naohatoa...

1085
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:09,180
Nagatoaa...

1086
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:13,560
Believe it, Naohato...

1087
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:18,680
Lets go inside and discuss about all the latest episodes of Naruto.

1088
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,140
The anime, Naruto.

1089
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:32,040
You need to be gone.

1090
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,540
This can't be the end credits already!

1091
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:38,560
Nice.

1092
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:39,780
We did it.

1093
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:41,180
Nice.

1094
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,900
Now we are an elf.

1095
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:44,860
I like how like...

1096
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:48,260
After all that... Oh shit!

1097
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:49,160
Goodbye.

1098
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:51,020
Don't worry, we're fine.

1099
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,480
We're fine.

1100
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,860
We need a new outfit.

1101
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:56,740
Okay, I'm an angel.

1102
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,160
I am an...

1103
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:02,560
I'm an angel now.

1104
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:03,960
We need to find another elderly.

1105
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:09,000
We need to don't act otaku ever again.

1106
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:11,300
Fuck no!

1107
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:12,540
I wanted to be an angel!

1108
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,060
I wanted to be an angel.

1109
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:18,680
Guys, you guys think I did really well as a...

1110
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,540
As one of the... one of the weebs?

1111
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,920
Do you guys think I got what it takes to be a weeb?

1112
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:32,200
Was I like... was I like a...

1113
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,580
Super in character?

1114
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,160
No.

1115
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:36,660
You were Shigoi.

1116
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:39,720
The weeb is now a part of you.

1117
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:41,840
Okay, I got... let's see.

1118
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,220
Um... no, I don't want to wear this hat.

1119
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:45,860
There you go.

1120
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:46,500
I don't want to wear this.

1121
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:47,240
A fisherman hat.

1122
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,360
Believe... if it works, it works.

1123
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:51,920
Close enough.

1124
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:52,280
Alright.

1125
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:53,300
Knock knock!

1126
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:55,940
That one caused me physical pain.

1127
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:56,660
Knock another...

1128
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:57,680
What the fuck?

1129
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:58,400
You're naked!

1130
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:03,320
What brings you to my cosmic abode at this hour?

1131
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:08,320
I'm here for the...

1132
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:10,420
The group...

1133
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:11,780
No, I shouldn't say that.

1134
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,160
Hello, I'm here for the group meetup.

1135
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:23,610
I believe she's right.

1136
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:25,170
Oh, what a far out...

1137
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:26,450
What a coincidence, man!

1138
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:30,390
We've got a group meetup happening right now!

1139
00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:32,530
Come on in!

1140
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:35,770
I'm enjoying the cosmic vibes!

1141
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:38,930
Just leave your shoes at the door.

1142
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:40,470
Peace and love, baby!

1143
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:44,430
Far out, man.

1144
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:48,910
I can't wait to be grouped up with all of you.

1145
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:51,070
Yeah, radical!

1146
00:49:55,710 --> 00:49:58,250
Right on, my fellow radical!

1147
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:03,050
Come on in and embrace the groovy vibes of togetherness!

1148
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:11,750
Totally, totally mad.

1149
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:15,030
Now we can be grouped up together.

1150
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:17,850
This is not au naturel!

1151
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:19,310
Oh no.

1152
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:20,850
Oh no!

1153
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:22,030
My wig!

1154
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:24,110
I could have had a wig!

1155
00:50:25,610 --> 00:50:26,250
No!

1156
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:30,950
No!

1157
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:35,150
I did travel all the way to get the wig now!

1158
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:36,370
Okay, I need that wig.

1159
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:38,230
I need the wig.

1160
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:39,810
That was deserved.

1161
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:43,670
I can't believe that's all it takes just to tell you you're here for the...

1162
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:45,850
the group meetup.

1163
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:48,310
You know, where we discuss about...

1164
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:49,870
PG things.

1165
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:50,710
Really?

1166
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:55,070
He was the only one who understood.

1167
00:50:55,070 --> 00:50:56,590
I need to go...

1168
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:57,390
go over there.

1169
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:58,610
I need to get my wig.

1170
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:02,390
I need to snatch that wig right now.

1171
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:03,930
Wait, where did I...

1172
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:04,990
where did I kill him?

1173
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:07,290
Which house was it?

1174
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:08,890
Oh my god, I can't tell.

1175
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:09,950
There's so many houses.

1176
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:11,690
Oh my god, that's a...

1177
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:12,590
Okay, wait.

1178
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:14,310
I need a...

1179
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:15,970
Okay, that clearly doesn't work.

1180
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:17,370
Let me grab the wig.

1181
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:19,530
And then I need to grab...

1182
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:20,650
this dress.

1183
00:51:22,290 --> 00:51:23,170
Alright, here we go.

1184
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:24,810
I'm here for the nurse.

1185
00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:25,570
I'm here for the vet.

1186
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:27,330
Okay.

1187
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:30,350
Oh my god, this is a dude bro.

1188
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:31,170
He's...

1189
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:32,670
Oh my god, I can trick him so easily.

1190
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:33,250
Watch this.

1191
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:39,890
Well, butter my biscuits.

1192
00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:43,110
What in tarnation do you want, you colourful critter?

1193
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:44,850
I'm a woman.

1194
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:49,750
What?

1195
00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:52,010
My apologies, man.

1196
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:53,810
What can I do for you?

1197
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:55,210
Okay.

1198
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:56,190
Okay.

1199
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:56,810
Okay, alright.

1200
00:51:57,590 --> 00:51:58,030
Okay,

1201
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:19,590
I didn't think I would get this far.

1202
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:21,290
Shit, okay.

1203
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:23,550
I'm not very good at raising people, clearly.

1204
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:30,570
Okay.

1205
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:33,450
Wow, okay wait.

1206
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:58,530
Why don't you tell me what you really came here for?

1207
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:00,750
Wow, okay wait wait.

1208
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:01,430
Wow sir.

1209
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:04,570
Dangerous, huh?

1210
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:06,630
I love danger.

1211
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:13,950
Actually, negative risk.

1212
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:16,050
Alright, you think you can do better?

1213
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:17,390
What would you say?

1214
00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:19,410
What would you say?

1215
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:20,230
I'm too aggressive.

1216
00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:22,170
Okay, what would you say then?

1217
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:24,530
What would you say to this man?

1218
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:27,150
To make him let you in the house?

1219
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:28,710
Please stop.

1220
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:34,790
What would you say?

1221
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:37,390
What would you say?

1222
00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:37,950
My finger.

1223
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:39,510
Let me in the house.

1224
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:44,850
Well you see, sir.

1225
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:48,550
I too have a really big gun.

1226
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:51,470
Why don't you let me in the sea?

1227
00:53:56,910 --> 00:53:57,270
No!

1228
00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:03,370
But I reckon I just can't let any old soul changer in the sea my belongings.

1229
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:07,210
Sorry, I bought by God, keep my home said safe.

1230
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:09,630
This is why I don't take chat's advice.

1231
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:11,550
I can't, but I fucking knew it.

1232
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:13,690
I fucking knew it.

1233
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:15,870
Everything I said was good.

1234
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:18,490
He liked everything I said chat.

1235
00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:22,090
And then I said, whatever you guys wanted to say.

1236
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:24,030
And then he shut the door.

1237
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,650
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

1238
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:27,430
Thank you, thank you.

1239
00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:29,650
You can't say no Riz!

1240
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:31,450
Because I took your advice!

1241
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:32,810
I took chat's advice.

1242
00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:34,470
Oh, I got a six pack of beer.

1243
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:35,090
I'll say that.

1244
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:36,710
This is your fault.

1245
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:37,890
I don't know, I don't know.

1246
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:40,990
One, here's that duffel bag of yours.

1247
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:45,290
I have a six pack full of beer on me.

1248
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:46,890
In this duffel bag.

1249
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:51,940
Hello, I'm Riz!

1250
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:57,020
Just because you got some beer...

1251
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:59,620
Don't mean you getting an invite in.

1252
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:02,160
Gotta earn my trust first.

1253
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,020
You're handsome.

1254
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:12,410
Well now, ain't you a smooth talker?

1255
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:15,390
Flattery won't get you far with me though.

1256
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:19,090
Need something more than nice words to earn my trust.

1257
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:20,390
Okay, shit.

1258
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:21,090
Okay, okay.

1259
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:23,790
I thought that was all I needed.

1260
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:24,910
I thought that...

1261
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:28,250
You saying you're handsome was everything I need to get in.

1262
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:30,930
I'm so sm- It was- It's not that easy.

1263
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:32,030
I'm not inside yet.

1264
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:36,710
So, so did you see that football game?

1265
00:55:37,090 --> 00:55:42,410
I can't believe they kept showing Taylor Swift in the Super Bowl.

1266
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:47,970
Football game?

1267
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:49,410
I go, what?

1268
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:53,690
And who in the hog's breath is Taylor Swift?

1269
00:55:54,290 --> 00:55:57,870
This conversation ain't earning you no- Bro!

1270
00:55:57,870 --> 00:55:59,790
He's a fake American!

1271
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:04,370
What do you mean football is a sissy sport?

1272
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:07,610
Everyone in America loves football!

1273
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:10,970
Emily, thank you for the 10 gifted chips.

1274
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:11,630
Thank you.

1275
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:12,350
Thank you.

1276
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:13,890
Oh my God.

1277
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:15,190
Okay.

1278
00:56:15,350 --> 00:56:15,790
Fuck.

1279
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:16,590
Talk about trucks.

1280
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:17,950
I love trucks.

1281
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:23,060
Oh my God!

1282
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:23,800
He loves trucks too!

1283
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:25,460
Hot dog.

1284
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:27,940
Finally, something we can agree on.

1285
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:31,500
Trucks are the bare backbone of this here country.

1286
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:34,400
Tell me more about your love of trucks.

1287
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,960
Okay, any truck drivers in my chat right now.

1288
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,480
There's so many of you.

1289
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:39,600
Any truck drivers.

1290
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:41,540
Tell me- Give me a fun fact about trucks.

1291
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:42,680
Right now.

1292
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,620
I need a fun fact about trucks.

1293
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:48,720
I need- America.

1294
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,240
Hell yeah, brother.

1295
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:51,160
Um.

1296
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:55,520
What's a f- What's something good to talk to other truck drivers?

1297
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,060
What do I say?

1298
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:59,640
Trucks have nuts and bolts.

1299
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:01,560
I need a fun fact.

1300
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:04,700
I need a fun fact about trucks right now.

1301
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:05,600
Um.

1302
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:08,000
Are you a Ford or a Chevy kind of guy?

1303
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:11,860
Are you a Ford or a Chevy kind of guy?

1304
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:17,980
Well, I'll be.

1305
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:22,280
You should know the right questions that- What is a Ford and a Chevy?

1306
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,840
I'm a Ford man through and through.

1307
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:26,820
You seem like good company.

1308
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:27,860
Come on in.

1309
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:29,420
Let's crack- Oh, shit!

1310
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:29,860
It worked!

1311
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:31,200
Trucks!

1312
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:33,360
That's fucking right.

1313
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:35,620
Get over here.

1314
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:37,860
Get off my lawn!

1315
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,000
Nice.

1316
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:40,340
Okay.

1317
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:41,040
That's all it takes.

1318
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,740
I just needed to talk about trucks.

1319
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:44,800
It was that easy.

1320
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:46,060
Nice.

1321
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:47,960
Anyway, now they come back here.

1322
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:52,060
Okay.

1323
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,280
Give me a sec.

1324
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:55,720
I gotta go back to get my gun.

1325
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,300
We have the Riz.

1326
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,060
We just need to talk about trucks.

1327
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:01,060
It was that easy.

1328
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:02,400
I need to take his gun.

1329
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:04,520
I'm heading to the gun right now.

1330
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:05,300
KONDA!

1331
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:06,700
Welcome to the tomato farm!

1332
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:07,540
Welcome, welcome!

1333
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,740
I need to go get that gun.

1334
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,020
We're so good at this chat.

1335
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:24,480
I think we're actually pretty good at this whole- This whole fucking, you know, um, killing people thing.

1336
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:25,780
Alright.

1337
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:27,860
Now I'm the redneck here.

1338
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:28,820
Alright.

1339
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:30,620
Knock knock.

1340
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:32,120
Shit, what do I say?

1341
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,020
There's a zombie apoco- Okay, yeah, I'm gonna say that.

1342
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:43,370
Oh my god, Rusty, what are you doing here?

1343
00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:46,250
Can't you see it's way past my bedtime?

1344
00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:48,230
Oh my god, they think I'm Rusty!

1345
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:51,550
Regina!

1346
00:58:53,810 --> 00:58:55,810
There's a zombie apocalypse right now!

1347
00:58:56,210 --> 00:58:57,130
Everybody's dead!

1348
00:58:58,270 --> 00:58:59,530
Is that too aggressive?

1349
00:59:02,370 --> 00:59:03,050
Zombies?

1350
00:59:03,050 --> 00:59:05,150
That is so last season!

1351
00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:12,270
I'm not about to let those brainless creatures ruin my fabulous night by- What?

1352
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:14,450
Bro!

1353
00:59:14,930 --> 00:59:18,090
What if there was a zombie apocalypse, Regina?

1354
00:59:18,770 --> 00:59:20,110
You would die!

1355
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:25,430
Alright, Regina didn't believe me.

1356
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:26,610
Who would've thought?

1357
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:28,170
Regina did not.

1358
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:29,070
Okay.

1359
00:59:29,350 --> 00:59:32,490
What if I wear- If I wear a lab coat?

1360
00:59:33,090 --> 00:59:34,070
Okay, wait, wait.

1361
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:34,850
I'm gonna make this work.

1362
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:37,090
I'm gonna make this work.

1363
00:59:37,330 --> 00:59:37,930
Alright.

1364
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:48,410
What is this dweeb doing at my doorstep with a freaking AK-47?

1365
00:59:48,670 --> 00:59:51,210
How did you even get here?

1366
00:59:51,430 --> 00:59:54,170
Get out before I call the police.

1367
00:59:57,050 --> 00:59:59,650
Look, I can make her believe there's a zombie apocalypse.

1368
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:06,670
If a British Hematist can make a regular guy believe there's a zombie apocalypse, I can too.

1369
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:08,390
We almost have the same credentials.

1370
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:09,950
I have a lab coat on.

1371
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:16,490
Regina, I am a scientist and there is a zombie apocalypse going on right now.

1372
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:18,510
We need your help.

1373
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:23,240
I don't know.

1374
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:26,380
Like, I would waste my time on some ridiculous apocalypse.

1375
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:27,040
Zombie nonsense.

1376
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:29,760
Goodbye and good luck, loser.

1377
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:30,560
Regina!

1378
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:33,700
Your parents are gonna die!

1379
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:36,040
Regina!

1380
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:37,720
Okay, what if I wear a hat?

1381
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:38,500
Alright.

1382
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:41,860
We can make her believe a zombie apocalypse is happening.

1383
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:42,420
I swear.

1384
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:42,920
We can.

1385
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:44,580
We can do this together.

1386
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:49,220
Oh my god, you're for real?

1387
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:50,680
What is- Earth is that outfit?

1388
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:55,620
You think you're gonna walk into my life like, hey, I'm the mad scientist of- Oh my god!

1389
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:57,600
Regina is so hurtful!

1390
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:01,480
Bro!

1391
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:03,580
That hurts, man!

1392
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:05,280
Regina!

1393
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:09,300
Okay.

1394
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,820
There has been a pandemic.

1395
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:15,440
And we think it's very serious.

1396
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:19,140
The undead is rising right now, Regina.

1397
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,320
I didn't say zombies.

1398
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:25,500
Excuse me?

1399
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:29,120
Are you seriously trying to scare me with some ridiculous story about zombies?

1400
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:31,020
But I'm not falling for it.

1401
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:33,480
Now kindly leave before I call this week.

1402
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,860
Regina, why don't you believe me?

1403
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:38,420
Is it really- Okay, I'm gonna try this house.

1404
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:41,860
These people will believe me about the zombie apocalypse, right?

1405
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:45,840
Greetings, my scientific friend.

1406
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:49,160
How can I guide you in this blessed night?

1407
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:51,240
Okay.

1408
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:55,320
Father, there's a zombie apocalypse going on right now.

1409
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,300
I'm sent here to protect you.

1410
01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:03,350
Oh my zombie apocalypse?

1411
01:02:03,710 --> 01:02:05,150
Well, thank you for your concern.

1412
01:02:05,910 --> 01:02:08,030
But I have to kindly decline your offer.

1413
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:11,510
May God bless and keep you safe in your endeavors.

1414
01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:12,390
Goodbye.

1415
01:02:12,590 --> 01:02:13,850
Are you fucking- Okay, wait.

1416
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:14,330
I got an idea.

1417
01:02:14,850 --> 01:02:15,850
Guys, I got an idea.

1418
01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:17,810
Oh shit.

1419
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:19,290
Oh shit.

1420
01:02:19,370 --> 01:02:20,790
Wait, let me get my scientist outfit.

1421
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:21,170
Please.

1422
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:23,370
Please, let me- I have an idea, guys.

1423
01:02:23,570 --> 01:02:24,430
I have an idea.

1424
01:02:24,530 --> 01:02:27,270
I just- I have the biggest brain idea right now.

1425
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:29,450
I just need to grab my outfit real fast.

1426
01:02:29,930 --> 01:02:30,370
Alright.

1427
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:34,980
I have an idea.

1428
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:41,240
We shall rely on the divine protection of the Lord against such Hesian threats.

1429
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:42,780
Be gone with- Oh shit!

1430
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:43,860
I thought I looked different.

1431
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:44,460
Okay, wait.

1432
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:47,640
Where is- Where's the- We need to find the wings.

1433
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:50,440
Does anyone remember where the wings are?

1434
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:51,460
Where-

1435
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:56,940
Where the fuck are the angel wings?

1436
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:57,820
I have an idea.

1437
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,280
No, this is the- This is gonna be so smart, guys.

1438
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:01,220
Trust me on this.

1439
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:04,040
Oh my god, where the fuck is the angel wings?

1440
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:06,840
I just need the angel- Hello?

1441
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:09,700
Hello, guys?

1442
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:14,240
Guys?

1443
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:14,840
I'm back!

1444
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:18,000
Guys, I'm back, guys!

1445
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:19,660
I'm back!

1446
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:21,260
Alright.

1447
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:21,900
Okay, okay.

1448
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:22,560
Guys.

1449
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:23,720
Okay, listen to this.

1450
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:25,140
Oh my god, there's the angel wings!

1451
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:25,740
Okay.

1452
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:27,060
We got- We got the angel wings.

1453
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:27,820
We got the angel wings.

1454
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:28,960
Alright.

1455
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:29,080
Alright.

1456
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:30,360
We got this.

1457
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:33,680
I got- Guys.

1458
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:35,880
Greetings, my scientist friend.

1459
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:40,260
What celestial discovery have you made today that has brought you to my humble abode?

1460
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,420
Let us rejoice in the wonders of the universe.

1461
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:47,460
Father, God told me there is a zombie apocalypse.

1462
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:55,620
Oh dear, a zombie apocalypse, you say?

1463
01:03:55,920 --> 01:04:01,840
Well, my friend, if that is truly the case, we must- We must prepare ourselves for battle against the forces of darkness.

1464
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:08,540
Let us pray and seek guidance from the almighty to protect us from this impending doom.

1465
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:10,100
It will work!

1466
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:13,560
The zombie story is going to work, chat.

1467
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:15,740
It's going to work.

1468
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:21,100
Do not be afraid.

1469
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,240
Do not be afraid.

1470
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:27,940
God has sent me down here to protect you.

1471
01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:31,700
For you are his most favored child.

1472
01:04:36,370 --> 01:04:39,430
Oh, what a blessing to hear such words.

1473
01:04:39,810 --> 01:04:42,490
I am humbled by your presence, dear scientist.

1474
01:04:42,790 --> 01:04:46,050
I truly believe that God has chosen you to protect us.

1475
01:04:46,190 --> 01:04:47,890
That shall put my faith in you.

1476
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:52,090
Let's stand together and face this challenge head on.

1477
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:55,050
For the glory of the Lord's source.

1478
01:04:55,650 --> 01:04:57,190
Trust me, bro.

1479
01:05:00,350 --> 01:05:05,910
With God by our side, we will protect you from the zombie apocalypse.

1480
01:05:06,530 --> 01:05:07,790
Do not worry.

1481
01:05:12,270 --> 01:05:16,630
Thank you, dear scientist, for your unwavering faith and assurance.

1482
01:05:16,970 --> 01:05:22,050
I believe that God has indeed sent you to aid us in these troubled times.

1483
01:05:22,370 --> 01:05:25,630
Please, come inside and let us discuss our plans.

1484
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:27,170
I think I'm going to be able to do that.

1485
01:05:27,170 --> 01:05:28,030
I think I can.

1486
01:05:28,350 --> 01:05:35,750
Well, it is possible that God is willing to did his tusks to save us.

1487
01:05:38,490 --> 01:05:39,390
That's the case too.

1488
01:05:39,690 --> 01:05:50,930
The only way I can stop the zombie apocalypse isbased on you, multitudes...

1489
01:05:50,930 --> 01:05:51,090
The time that I can save you only 금aves

1490
01:05:54,530 --> 01:05:55,170
me...

1491
01:05:58,410 --> 01:06:01,090
All I needed was the angel wings!

1492
01:06:01,530 --> 01:06:03,050
That's all I needed!

1493
01:06:04,290 --> 01:06:04,870
Amen.

1494
01:06:05,710 --> 01:06:06,970
I told you.

1495
01:06:08,730 --> 01:06:10,570
Rest in peace, old man.

1496
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:14,150
That has zero ways of... What do you mean?

1497
01:06:14,350 --> 01:06:15,890
I literally ate him!

1498
01:06:16,090 --> 01:06:17,070
What do you mean?

1499
01:06:17,150 --> 01:06:18,810
I tricked the priest.

1500
01:06:19,610 --> 01:06:21,390
No, thank you for the super chat.

1501
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:22,390
Thank you, thank you.

1502
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:25,210
Funs to prepare for the zombie apocalypse.

1503
01:06:26,110 --> 01:06:27,590
Zebadee, thank you for the super chat.

1504
01:06:27,810 --> 01:06:28,130
Thank you.

1505
01:06:29,350 --> 01:06:30,310
Oh shit!

1506
01:06:30,430 --> 01:06:31,210
Oh shit!

1507
01:06:31,370 --> 01:06:31,910
Don't worry.

1508
01:06:32,610 --> 01:06:33,910
Now I'm the priest.

1509
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:35,310
Is this the priest room?

1510
01:06:35,470 --> 01:06:37,870
No, that's the gun guy.

1511
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:39,010
I'm gonna grab the gun though.

1512
01:06:39,350 --> 01:06:40,430
I want the gun.

1513
01:06:42,330 --> 01:06:42,810
Okay.

1514
01:06:42,810 --> 01:06:45,570
I wanna kill Regina now.

1515
01:06:45,770 --> 01:06:46,470
Fuck Regina.

1516
01:06:46,610 --> 01:06:47,190
I hate her.

1517
01:06:47,190 --> 01:06:47,870
I...

1518
01:06:50,830 --> 01:06:52,370
Fucking hate Regina.

1519
01:06:55,170 --> 01:06:55,750
Alright.

1520
01:06:56,770 --> 01:06:57,350
Alright.

1521
01:06:57,810 --> 01:06:58,770
Oh shit!

1522
01:06:58,850 --> 01:06:59,070
Okay.

1523
01:06:59,630 --> 01:07:01,430
What if I just tell her I'm a vampire?

1524
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:03,290
Maybe she's a Twilight nut.

1525
01:07:04,210 --> 01:07:05,370
Maybe... Maybe...

1526
01:07:06,330 --> 01:07:08,290
Maybe she's a Twilight nut.

1527
01:07:09,810 --> 01:07:10,810
Well, well, well.

1528
01:07:10,970 --> 01:07:12,690
If it isn't the king of the nerds.

1529
01:07:12,690 --> 01:07:15,930
What brings you to my doorstep at this ungodly hour?

1530
01:07:15,930 --> 01:07:18,270
Spill the tea, Regina.

1531
01:07:18,530 --> 01:07:21,210
Everything Stephanie Myers wrote about vampires.

1532
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:22,530
It is true.

1533
01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:23,870
We do sparkle.

1534
01:07:24,070 --> 01:07:26,350
I am Edward's cousin!

1535
01:07:30,690 --> 01:07:31,970
Oh, please.

1536
01:07:32,130 --> 01:07:33,490
Like, I'm gonna believe that.

1537
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:35,010
Vampires don't sparkle.

1538
01:07:35,230 --> 01:07:38,070
It's just a sad attempt at making them glamorous.

1539
01:07:38,470 --> 01:07:42,930
You can keep your delusions to yourself, Edward's cousins or not.

1540
01:07:42,930 --> 01:07:43,370
What?

1541
01:07:43,890 --> 01:07:46,510
You don't... You're not a Twilight girl?

1542
01:07:46,850 --> 01:07:49,210
Oh my... She's a Jacob fan.

1543
01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:52,390
She was a... She's a Jacob fan.

1544
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:54,210
Oh my god.

1545
01:07:54,430 --> 01:07:55,070
She's...

1546
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:57,070
She's a fucking Jacob fan.

1547
01:07:59,830 --> 01:08:00,470
Wait.

1548
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:01,650
Okay.

1549
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:02,130
Okay.

1550
01:08:02,130 --> 01:08:02,410
Wait.

1551
01:08:02,550 --> 01:08:04,790
I can't bel... Ask her to...

1552
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:07,410
I can't believe she's not for Team Edward.

1553
01:08:07,770 --> 01:08:08,730
What the fuck?

1554
01:08:09,130 --> 01:08:09,770
Okay.

1555
01:08:10,510 --> 01:08:12,310
What if I just... No!

1556
01:08:12,310 --> 01:08:12,810
I can't!

1557
01:08:12,810 --> 01:08:12,910
No!

1558
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:15,770
Let me talk to Regina!

1559
01:08:16,150 --> 01:08:18,050
Let me talk to her!

1560
01:08:18,670 --> 01:08:19,230
Alright.

1561
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:20,730
If I just wear a crown...

1562
01:08:20,730 --> 01:08:21,390
Alright.

1563
01:08:21,390 --> 01:08:21,390
If I just wear a crown...

1564
01:08:21,390 --> 01:08:22,730
I can be like a werewolf.

1565
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:24,810
Cause like werewolves are mostly...

1566
01:08:24,810 --> 01:08:27,110
ask her about werewolf puberty.

1567
01:08:27,510 --> 01:08:31,270
I can't believe Regina was a fucking Team Jacob all along.

1568
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:32,250
I can't believe Regina was a fucking Team Jacob all along.

1569
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:33,390
Hello Regina.

1570
01:08:33,650 --> 01:08:35,070
I would fucking kill Regina.

1571
01:08:35,610 --> 01:08:37,950
I have no time for your vampire families.

1572
01:08:38,050 --> 01:08:41,710
And I definitely don't care about Edward's extended family.

1573
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:43,090
Oh my god.

1574
01:08:43,130 --> 01:08:43,290
Okay.

1575
01:08:43,330 --> 01:08:44,210
What if I wear glasses?

1576
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:45,210
Do I look different now?

1577
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:50,050
What is happening here?

1578
01:08:50,090 --> 01:08:51,970
Did you borrow your outfit from a dumpster?

1579
01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:55,350
I can't believe I have to see this mess at my doorstep.

1580
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:59,490
Just leave before you tarnish my perfect image any further.

1581
01:09:01,110 --> 01:09:02,230
Team Jacob?

1582
01:09:07,490 --> 01:09:08,610
As if.

1583
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:09,930
Team Jacob?

1584
01:09:10,430 --> 01:09:12,030
That's so last year.

1585
01:09:12,030 --> 01:09:15,310
I can't even handle your fashion choices.

1586
01:09:15,510 --> 01:09:16,090
I can't even handle your fashion choices.

1587
01:09:16,090 --> 01:09:17,870
I know you're poor taste in fictional.

1588
01:09:18,090 --> 01:09:19,090
What is...

1589
01:09:19,090 --> 01:09:20,590
What does she like?

1590
01:09:20,930 --> 01:09:22,530
What does she like?

1591
01:09:26,990 --> 01:09:28,770
What is she into?

1592
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:32,830
Alright.

1593
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:34,590
Any like...

1594
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:38,590
Any Virginias in chat know what the fuck they like?

1595
01:09:38,970 --> 01:09:41,470
What do teenagers like anymore?

1596
01:09:42,030 --> 01:09:42,610
I can't even see your two guns.

1597
01:09:43,090 --> 01:09:44,850
What do teenagers like these days?

1598
01:09:45,190 --> 01:09:46,730
I can't relate to them.

1599
01:09:47,270 --> 01:09:49,850
All I knew was Team Edward and Jacob.

1600
01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:52,650
Oh my god.

1601
01:09:52,710 --> 01:09:53,950
Maybe she's a K-pop stan.

1602
01:09:54,950 --> 01:09:55,390
Okay.

1603
01:09:55,390 --> 01:09:55,710
Wait, wait.

1604
01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:56,190
You're right.

1605
01:09:56,290 --> 01:09:56,630
You're right.

1606
01:09:58,110 --> 01:09:58,550
Okay.

1607
01:09:58,550 --> 01:09:58,990
Okay.

1608
01:09:59,010 --> 01:09:59,710
She could be...

1609
01:09:59,710 --> 01:10:01,570
She could be a K-pop stan, guys.

1610
01:10:02,090 --> 01:10:03,590
She could be a K-pop stan.

1611
01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:04,410
I need a new outfit.

1612
01:10:04,890 --> 01:10:05,330
Okay.

1613
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:07,130
I'll ask...

1614
01:10:08,450 --> 01:10:08,890
BTS?

1615
01:10:08,890 --> 01:10:09,150
BTS?

1616
01:10:12,890 --> 01:10:14,930
I need a new shirt.

1617
01:10:15,210 --> 01:10:17,890
I don't have a shirt right now.

1618
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:18,550
I don't have a shirt right now.

1619
01:10:18,690 --> 01:10:19,310
Where...

1620
01:10:20,070 --> 01:10:21,070
Where is this?

1621
01:10:21,290 --> 01:10:26,210
Ask her about the critically acclaimed MMORPG Final Fantasy.

1622
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:27,690
Alright.

1623
01:10:28,210 --> 01:10:30,350
Okay, we need this.

1624
01:10:31,090 --> 01:10:31,730
And...

1625
01:10:31,730 --> 01:10:32,990
Okay, I don't want the helmet though.

1626
01:10:33,210 --> 01:10:34,230
Alright, here you go.

1627
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:36,530
Alright.

1628
01:10:38,890 --> 01:10:39,570
Alright.

1629
01:10:40,190 --> 01:10:40,930
Well, well, well.

1630
01:10:40,950 --> 01:10:43,010
Look who decided to crash the party.

1631
01:10:43,310 --> 01:10:43,730
Well, well, well.

1632
01:10:43,730 --> 01:10:43,730
Look who decided to crash the party.

1633
01:10:43,730 --> 01:10:45,010
Lose your invitation, sweetie?

1634
01:10:45,210 --> 01:10:46,090
It's Halloween.

1635
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:48,030
Not a fashion disaster.

1636
01:10:48,490 --> 01:10:49,170
Convention.

1637
01:10:49,610 --> 01:10:51,110
But I guess you're used to that.

1638
01:10:52,990 --> 01:10:53,670
BTS?

1639
01:10:58,340 --> 01:10:59,020
Seriously?

1640
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:07,260
I guess if you're a mediocre boy band with too much hair gel, go for it.

1641
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:10,220
But don't expect any fashion tips from them.

1642
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:12,720
Their stylist must be on vacation.

1643
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:14,380
Oh my god!

1644
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:16,040
Okay!

1645
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:20,740
Guys, I just need you guys to know, whatever opinion Regina has, um...

1646
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:23,620
I am very neutral to everything.

1647
01:11:25,060 --> 01:11:29,000
As a content creator, I am very neutral to many things.

1648
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:33,580
And I cannot give my opinions on such topics.

1649
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:41,540
Are you a Swiftie?

1650
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:47,160
Um, excuse me?

1651
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:50,520
Do I look like someone who would associate with a fan of Taylor Swift?

1652
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:54,300
My taste in music is far superior, darling.

1653
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:55,960
Please show yourself out.

1654
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:57,780
What are you, Regina?

1655
01:11:59,080 --> 01:11:59,760
What?

1656
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:02,840
What are you?

1657
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:06,200
I don't know what she is.

1658
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:07,620
Guys!

1659
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:09,580
Oh hey, he's wearing a hat.

1660
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:12,560
I like how the top is wearing a beret now.

1661
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:13,620
Okay.

1662
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:17,760
What do they like?

1663
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:26,650
What does she like?

1664
01:12:26,830 --> 01:12:28,050
What does Regina like?

1665
01:12:31,290 --> 01:12:31,810
Okay.

1666
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:37,250
Okay.

1667
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:37,970
What do we have here?

1668
01:12:38,010 --> 01:12:40,910
Another lost boy scout trying to find his way home?

1669
01:12:42,310 --> 01:12:43,110
How quaint.

1670
01:12:43,250 --> 01:12:45,430
How about you take your little circus elsewhere?

1671
01:12:45,810 --> 01:12:46,470
Okay, wait.

1672
01:12:46,530 --> 01:12:46,890
I got it.

1673
01:12:47,010 --> 01:12:47,570
I got it.

1674
01:12:48,290 --> 01:12:55,490
Like, oh my god, Regina, you wouldn't believe the hot gossip tea that I just found out from Stephanie!

1675
01:13:00,450 --> 01:13:04,550
As if I would care about whatever gossip Stephanie has to share.

1676
01:13:04,670 --> 01:13:05,250
Take it.

1677
01:13:05,330 --> 01:13:06,630
What are you?

1678
01:13:07,210 --> 01:13:08,570
What are you?

1679
01:13:08,990 --> 01:13:10,130
You're not a...

1680
01:13:10,130 --> 01:13:12,550
You're not a regular person!

1681
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:14,270
Okay, wait.

1682
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:14,950
I got an idea.

1683
01:13:15,210 --> 01:13:17,570
I got an idea.

1684
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:21,850
I know.

1685
01:13:22,030 --> 01:13:22,910
I know now.

1686
01:13:22,990 --> 01:13:24,530
I know exactly who Regina is.

1687
01:13:26,090 --> 01:13:26,930
Oh my gosh.

1688
01:13:26,990 --> 01:13:27,730
Who are you?

1689
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:30,590
A rejected contestant for America's Next Top Model?

1690
01:13:31,330 --> 01:13:33,350
What's up with the lab coat and the crown?

1691
01:13:33,530 --> 01:13:35,410
I mean, that's a bold statement.

1692
01:13:35,530 --> 01:13:37,550
Not that I would ever wear it.

1693
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:44,040
Do you want to commit some online activism?

1694
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:53,220
I'm like, like that's so... I'm about in-person activism.

1695
01:13:53,540 --> 01:13:57,680
You know, making a statement with my fabulous outfits.

1696
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:00,800
Sorry, but I'm not... What are you?

1697
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:05,460
You're going against everything I'm like, know or like think I know.

1698
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:13,560
I don't know what she wants.

1699
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:18,700
Fashion?

1700
01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:20,660
Okay, we'll talk about fashion.

1701
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:21,720
Alright.

1702
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,360
Oh my God.

1703
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:30,580
Oh my God.

1704
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:32,440
Okay, well it's fashion.

1705
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:33,080
Okay.

1706
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:35,720
Where's... Okay, I need to dress something nice.

1707
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:36,780
Do fashion.

1708
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:37,520
Okay.

1709
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:40,140
I'll just be... I have an idea.

1710
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:41,280
I have an idea.

1711
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:43,600
I have an idea.

1712
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:44,620
I need to like grab...

1713
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:45,800
wear binoculars.

1714
01:14:45,860 --> 01:14:47,400
I need like the perfect item.

1715
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:48,880
Wear a bow.

1716
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:52,040
Oh my gosh, now I'm actually a crazy person if I wear that.

1717
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:54,980
I need to like find like a nice...

1718
01:14:54,980 --> 01:14:56,480
He took my beret!

1719
01:14:57,620 --> 01:15:00,240
He took my beret so I can't wear it!

1720
01:15:00,620 --> 01:15:02,180
Wait, I need to get the long hair.

1721
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:06,160
Where is it?

1722
01:15:06,820 --> 01:15:07,940
Where's the blonde hair?

1723
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:09,280
I forgot.

1724
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:10,640
Where was the...

1725
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:13,160
Who was it that I killed that had the blonde hair?

1726
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:17,200
Who was... Oh, there it is.

1727
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:18,920
Alright, here you go.

1728
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:20,060
Nice.

1729
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:21,500
Now I look gorgeous.

1730
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:23,860
Is this... Is this her?

1731
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:25,340
Is this Regina?

1732
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:27,140
Yeah, Regina.

1733
01:15:33,010 --> 01:15:33,750
Oh my God.

1734
01:15:33,770 --> 01:15:35,130
A human version of me?

1735
01:15:35,150 --> 01:15:35,870
A Malibu Barbie?

1736
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:37,970
What are you doing here this late?

1737
01:15:38,170 --> 01:15:41,090
I'm just dying to show off another one of your lame outfits.

1738
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:42,390
Um...

1739
01:15:43,630 --> 01:15:44,730
Like, oh my gosh.

1740
01:15:44,870 --> 01:15:51,130
I am an agent for Tyre Banks and I think you have got what it takes to be America's Next Top Model.

1741
01:15:55,380 --> 01:15:59,820
Oh please, like I need your endorsement to know I'm model material!

1742
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:05,980
I've got plenty of agencies dying to sign me already.

1743
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:07,720
Jesus Christ!

1744
01:16:10,340 --> 01:16:11,100
Bro!

1745
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:13,840
What the fuck?

1746
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:15,980
What does she want?

1747
01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:20,420
Tyre Banks.

1748
01:16:20,980 --> 01:16:22,620
Oh my God.

1749
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:23,080
Regina.

1750
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:25,640
I went with fashion.

1751
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:27,400
I went with BTS.

1752
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:30,720
I went with Team Edward and Team Jacob.

1753
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:33,460
I'm fucking going with Uber Eats.

1754
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:34,340
I'm fucking doing Uber Eats.

1755
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:36,100
I'm doing Uber Eats.

1756
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:37,440
Fuck this.

1757
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:43,000
Why would she want fashion tips?

1758
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:46,520
Okay.

1759
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:47,560
I'm where I got this.

1760
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:49,400
I'm going with Uber Eats.

1761
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:50,880
If all else fails...

1762
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:53,520
Uber Eats time.

1763
01:16:54,060 --> 01:16:56,100
A walking... how absolutely thrilling.

1764
01:16:56,260 --> 01:16:56,920
What do you want?

1765
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,100
Uber Eats.

1766
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:03,400
Oh please.

1767
01:17:03,580 --> 01:17:08,940
Like I would like to allow someone who relies on Uber Eats into my fabulous party.

1768
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:11,320
Do better next time, darling.

1769
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:12,680
You don't want...

1770
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:14,280
It's literally free Uber Eats.

1771
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:15,900
It's free Uber Eats.

1772
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,800
And you don't want free Uber Eats.

1773
01:17:17,980 --> 01:17:19,860
Oh my... What do you want?

1774
01:17:20,020 --> 01:17:21,340
What do you want?

1775
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:23,760
Regina!

1776
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:25,740
Let me in!

1777
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:31,280
She's such a contrarian.

1778
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:33,880
She's too powerful.

1779
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:36,820
You gotta treat her like royalty.

1780
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,040
What does Regina want?

1781
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:41,700
What do you want, Regina?

1782
01:17:45,850 --> 01:17:46,590
What do you want, Regina?

1783
01:17:46,590 --> 01:17:46,930
What do you want, Regina?

1784
01:17:47,050 --> 01:17:47,430
Oh my gosh.

1785
01:17:47,530 --> 01:17:48,590
Like what are you doing here?

1786
01:17:48,670 --> 01:17:50,670
Is there a big juicy gossip you need to spill?

1787
01:17:50,770 --> 01:17:53,550
Are you just here to bask in my fabulousness?

1788
01:17:53,730 --> 01:17:54,510
Spill the tea?

1789
01:17:54,570 --> 01:17:56,070
Oh now you want the tea?

1790
01:17:57,610 --> 01:17:58,750
Like oh my gosh.

1791
01:17:58,870 --> 01:18:02,850
I am here to spill some juicy tea right now, Regina.

1792
01:18:04,410 --> 01:18:05,450
I am here to spill some juicy tea right now, Regina.

1793
01:18:07,590 --> 01:18:08,490
Now you...

1794
01:18:08,490 --> 01:18:09,370
Spill it!

1795
01:18:09,390 --> 01:18:09,750
Spill it!

1796
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:12,310
I'm so excited to hear all the juicy details.

1797
01:18:12,550 --> 01:18:13,950
Don't keep me waiting.

1798
01:18:14,330 --> 01:18:15,890
Spill that tea, hun!

1799
01:18:16,810 --> 01:18:17,930
Okay, so...

1800
01:18:17,930 --> 01:18:21,090
You know how Jerry was supposed to be dating Rebecca?

1801
01:18:21,670 --> 01:18:24,610
Well, Rebecca actually wants to date Charlie!

1802
01:18:25,870 --> 01:18:27,630
Well, Rebecca actually wants to date Charlie!

1803
01:18:27,630 --> 01:18:30,590
Well, Rebecca actually wants to date Charlie!

1804
01:18:30,590 --> 01:18:31,350
Oh my gosh.

1805
01:18:31,430 --> 01:18:33,090
I can't even...

1806
01:18:33,090 --> 01:18:35,430
Rebecca wants to take Charlie and I'm like...

1807
01:18:35,450 --> 01:18:35,650
What?

1808
01:18:35,650 --> 01:18:36,270
Instead of Jerry?

1809
01:18:36,550 --> 01:18:38,750
That is the ultimate betrayal!

1810
01:18:39,490 --> 01:18:43,090
The drama in my school is never ceasing to amaze me!

1811
01:18:43,370 --> 01:18:44,810
Thanks for sharing, hun.

1812
01:18:49,930 --> 01:18:51,290
Okay, now what do we do?

1813
01:18:51,370 --> 01:18:52,510
I never...

1814
01:18:52,510 --> 01:18:53,730
I didn't think...

1815
01:18:53,730 --> 01:18:56,630
I didn't think we were going to get this far.

1816
01:18:56,950 --> 01:18:59,650
I didn't think we were going to...

1817
01:19:01,870 --> 01:19:02,670
Oh my god.

1818
01:19:04,090 --> 01:19:05,050
Oh my god, Regina.

1819
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:07,390
I have so much to tell you.

1820
01:19:07,450 --> 01:19:11,150
But I need to come inside to give you more of that juicy tea.

1821
01:19:15,980 --> 01:19:17,000
Thanks for offering.

1822
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:19,760
But I already got my fill of juicy gossip for today.

1823
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:21,480
Maybe another time.

1824
01:19:21,860 --> 01:19:23,100
Darling, ta-ta...

1825
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:23,600
Wait, no!

1826
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:24,340
No!

1827
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:25,760
Okay, we're losing her.

1828
01:19:25,940 --> 01:19:26,700
We're losing her.

1829
01:19:26,940 --> 01:19:29,020
What else does she want other than tea?

1830
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:30,600
What else does she want?

1831
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:35,340
No, we're losing her!

1832
01:19:37,580 --> 01:19:39,120
Um, oh my god.

1833
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:42,140
You look amazing, by the way, Regina.

1834
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:44,000
Like, are those...

1835
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:44,880
Is that a new jacket?

1836
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:52,780
Oh, you noticed my fabulous jacket?

1837
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:53,680
Oh, you noticed my fabulous jacket?

1838
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:54,820
Well, thank you, darling.

1839
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:56,740
It's the latest designer piece.

1840
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:59,060
Tailored specifically for me.

1841
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:00,560
But enough about me.

1842
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,760
Spill more of that hot...

1843
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:04,140
Oh, now you want more.

1844
01:20:04,420 --> 01:20:05,400
Okay, fuck.

1845
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:05,820
Okay.

1846
01:20:06,020 --> 01:20:06,460
Um...

1847
01:20:06,460 --> 01:20:09,220
Shit, I need to make up more about this gossip.

1848
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:10,540
I need to make up...

1849
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:15,380
Okay, wait.

1850
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:16,340
Oh, so...

1851
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:17,880
Yeah, now she wants more.

1852
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:18,900
Fuck.

1853
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:19,940
Okay, guys.

1854
01:20:22,460 --> 01:20:24,960
She wants... She's in the gossip loop right now.

1855
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:26,040
Oh.

1856
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:27,380
Oh my god.

1857
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:28,260
Oh my god.

1858
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:30,200
Oh my god, but...

1859
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,880
Regina, the craziest part...

1860
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:33,960
is that...

1861
01:20:35,180 --> 01:20:36,220
Charles... actually...

1862
01:20:36,460 --> 01:20:37,060
likes Jerry.

1863
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:43,560
No way!

1864
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:45,400
Charles likes Jerry?

1865
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:48,520
That's like the plot twist of the century!

1866
01:20:48,860 --> 01:20:50,480
This scandal is...

1867
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:52,680
getting better and better.

1868
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:54,560
You really know how to...

1869
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:55,260
keep me entertained.

1870
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:57,440
Share more tea, sweetheart.

1871
01:20:57,680 --> 01:20:58,300
Okay, fuck.

1872
01:20:58,580 --> 01:20:58,960
Um...

1873
01:21:04,550 --> 01:21:06,470
Please just let me inside!

1874
01:21:08,490 --> 01:21:09,510
Oh my god.

1875
01:21:09,610 --> 01:21:10,550
I would love to...

1876
01:21:10,730 --> 01:21:12,050
share more tea, but...

1877
01:21:12,050 --> 01:21:14,310
I even have photos on my phone.

1878
01:21:14,390 --> 01:21:16,190
And I need to be inside to share that to you.

1879
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:22,720
Wait, you have actual photos?

1880
01:21:23,140 --> 01:21:24,280
Okay, spell it.

1881
01:21:24,340 --> 01:21:26,620
I'm dying to see the evidence, but let's keep it...

1882
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:26,960
exclusive.

1883
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:28,500
Just between you and me.

1884
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:30,440
Show me those pics, darling!

1885
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:32,320
Um...

1886
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:36,880
Let me inside your house, girlfriend!

1887
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:38,760
And I'll show you all the photos...

1888
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:39,240
you want!

1889
01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:46,020
Oh my gosh!

1890
01:21:46,180 --> 01:21:46,580
Oh my gosh!

1891
01:21:46,580 --> 01:21:48,860
You've earned yourself an exclusive...

1892
01:21:48,860 --> 01:21:49,620
Let me in!

1893
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:50,320
Let me in!

1894
01:21:50,380 --> 01:21:51,200
Let me in!

1895
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:55,960
Oh my god!

1896
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:58,160
Just let me in already!

1897
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:00,560
Jesus Christ!

1898
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,480
Get over here, Regina!

1899
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:03,260
Fuck you!

1900
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:06,900
Oh my god!

1901
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:09,960
Holy shit!

1902
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:10,960
Finally!

1903
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:12,560
Fuck you!

1904
01:22:12,580 --> 01:22:13,280
Regina!

1905
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:14,780
Jesus Christ!

1906
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:16,680
That took me fucking...

1907
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:19,620
forever to get into Regina's house!

1908
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,260
Oh my god!

1909
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:23,000
Final...

1910
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:25,020
raid pause...

1911
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:25,600
defeated.

1912
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,200
That is like so not fair.

1913
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:30,340
It's literally...

1914
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:31,480
God, girl.

1915
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:33,580
Jesus Christ, bro!

1916
01:22:33,660 --> 01:22:34,640
Fuck Regina!

1917
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:36,500
All bitches...

1918
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:37,260
hate Regina.

1919
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:39,620
Oh my god!

1920
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:42,420
I can't believe I got in the...

1921
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:43,440
Regina's house!

1922
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:44,700
Where is her outfit?

1923
01:22:45,140 --> 01:22:46,480
Oh no, that's the weeb.

1924
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:47,660
That's the...

1925
01:22:47,660 --> 01:22:48,940
brony weeb.

1926
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:49,540
No!

1927
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:53,500
I need to absorb Regina.

1928
01:22:54,140 --> 01:22:55,680
Alright, now I'm Regina.

1929
01:22:56,580 --> 01:22:57,860
There should be...

1930
01:22:57,860 --> 01:23:00,680
They should add 10 to the score.

1931
01:23:01,620 --> 01:23:02,320
Alright.

1932
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:03,080
No!

1933
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:03,600
Please!

1934
01:23:05,620 --> 01:23:06,320
No!

1935
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:07,780
I wanna be Regina!

1936
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:12,500
I can't believe...

1937
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:14,480
Like... Regina...

1938
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:16,720
didn't wanna fucking hear about the gossip...

1939
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:17,780
until like...

1940
01:23:17,780 --> 01:23:18,280
No!

1941
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:19,260
He took my hair!

1942
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:21,720
My beautiful hair!

1943
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:25,000
He took my hair!

1944
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:26,920
Oh my god.

1945
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,240
That's fucked up.

1946
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:30,520
That's fucked up.

1947
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:32,400
He actually took my...

1948
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:33,240
beautiful hair.

1949
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:35,400
Oh my god.

1950
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:36,680
Who am I gonna...

1951
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:36,980
be?

1952
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:37,980
I guess I'll just...

1953
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:39,540
I'll be Regina but better.

1954
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:43,740
Alright.

1955
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:44,080
Alright.

1956
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:44,620
Knock knock!

1957
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:49,660
Oh hey there!

1958
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:51,640
What brings a Barbie fan like...

1959
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:53,380
you at my door in the middle of the night?

1960
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:54,680
An autograph sign?

1961
01:23:54,980 --> 01:23:55,420
Or did you...

1962
01:23:55,420 --> 01:23:57,420
finally find Ken's missing shoe?

1963
01:23:57,560 --> 01:23:57,740
Okay.

1964
01:23:57,960 --> 01:23:59,000
Tommy Twizzler.

1965
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:01,360
He is a movie star.

1966
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:03,280
Um...

1967
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:05,440
Okay, I can be like an also...

1968
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:06,440

1969
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:09,520
Hello fellow movie... Regina George is a...

1970
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:10,140
massive deal.

1971
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:11,480
Tom, thank you for...

1972
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:12,100
the super chat.

1973
01:24:12,220 --> 01:24:12,640
Thank you.

1974
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:13,820
Fuck.

1975
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:14,340
Okay.

1976
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:15,720
Fuck.

1977
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:16,180
Okay.

1978
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:17,740
What is our...

1979
01:24:17,740 --> 01:24:19,080
What is our strat with Tommy?

1980
01:24:19,340 --> 01:24:20,020
What do we...

1981
01:24:20,020 --> 01:24:22,760
What do we wanna tell Tommy?

1982
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,180
You are enough.

1983
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:26,340
He's mean.

1984
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:27,440
Fuck.

1985
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:27,760
Okay.

1986
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:32,440
Oh my god.

1987
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:33,220
Damsel in distress.

1988
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:34,900
Oh my god.

1989
01:24:35,260 --> 01:24:37,460
Tommy, my car broke...

1990
01:24:37,460 --> 01:24:38,860
down and I don't know...

1991
01:24:39,540 --> 01:24:40,880
anything about cars.

1992
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:47,160
Oh Bubba, cars...

1993
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:48,340
can be a real pain.

1994
01:24:48,540 --> 01:24:50,960
Well lucky for you, I have a bit of a...

1995
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:52,220
mechanic myself.

1996
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:54,720
Which seems to be the...

1997
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:55,500
problem.

1998
01:25:10,290 --> 01:25:11,430
Oh my.

1999
01:25:11,750 --> 01:25:13,870
You big, strong man...

2000
01:25:13,870 --> 01:25:15,890
is gonna help me fix my...

2001
01:25:15,890 --> 01:25:16,290
car?

2002
01:25:20,670 --> 01:25:21,270
No!

2003
01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:22,650
No!

2004
01:25:22,710 --> 01:25:22,830
No!

2005
01:25:22,830 --> 01:25:23,510
I'm losing him!

2006
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:24,950
I'm losing him!

2007
01:25:25,350 --> 01:25:28,010
Just don't expect me to be some kind of superhero or anything.

2008
01:25:28,190 --> 01:25:29,850
Cars can be tricky, you know.

2009
01:25:30,010 --> 01:25:30,950
Okay, I could be like...

2010
01:25:30,950 --> 01:25:33,890
I didn't know that I'm so...

2011
01:25:33,890 --> 01:25:34,630
stupid.

2012
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:43,480
Oh my god.

2013
01:25:46,890 --> 01:25:47,230
Fuck.

2014
01:25:47,230 --> 01:25:47,550
Okay.

2015
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:49,350
I'm losing him.

2016
01:25:49,550 --> 01:25:50,430
I'm losing him.

2017
01:25:51,910 --> 01:25:53,190
What do I say?

2018
01:25:54,110 --> 01:25:55,770
What do I say?

2019
01:25:56,250 --> 01:25:56,730
What do I say?

2020
01:25:56,730 --> 01:25:58,070
Don't be so...

2021
01:26:00,110 --> 01:26:03,030
He's not that self-absorbed.

2022
01:26:03,170 --> 01:26:04,450
Y'all build him up?

2023
01:26:05,150 --> 01:26:06,390
God damn it!

2024
01:26:06,390 --> 01:26:07,350
I don't know what to say!

2025
01:26:11,090 --> 01:26:11,770
Um...

2026
01:26:13,510 --> 01:26:14,570
Don't freak...

2027
01:26:14,570 --> 01:26:15,210
Okay, wait.

2028
01:26:15,390 --> 01:26:16,370
You can change...

2029
01:26:16,370 --> 01:26:18,550
I just wanna try and make it...

2030
01:26:18,550 --> 01:26:19,710
I can't do that!

2031
01:26:19,790 --> 01:26:20,450
I'm a fucking...

2032
01:26:20,450 --> 01:26:21,050
VTuber!

2033
01:26:21,410 --> 01:26:22,410
Everything's gonna be...

2034
01:26:22,410 --> 01:26:22,770
awkward!

2035
01:26:24,330 --> 01:26:26,390
Tell him you need help with the...

2036
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:27,670
exhaust pipe!

2037
01:26:28,270 --> 01:26:29,430
Oh my god!

2038
01:26:29,670 --> 01:26:30,090
Okay.

2039
01:26:30,690 --> 01:26:31,710
You're so...

2040
01:26:31,710 --> 01:26:33,530
You're so right, Tommy.

2041
01:26:33,690 --> 01:26:34,370
Cars are...

2042
01:26:34,370 --> 01:26:35,350
so tricky.

2043
01:26:35,790 --> 01:26:36,450
I hope...

2044
01:26:36,450 --> 01:26:38,550
you can help me fix my car...

2045
01:26:38,550 --> 01:26:39,290
and help me.

2046
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:45,140
Well, I'll certainly...

2047
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:46,380
give my best shot.

2048
01:26:46,660 --> 01:26:48,560
I can't promise anything...

2049
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:50,580
about doing what I can to help you.

2050
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:52,820
Let's go take a look at your...

2051
01:26:52,820 --> 01:26:55,040
car and see if you can figure out the problem.

2052
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:55,700
Alright?

2053
01:26:56,260 --> 01:26:56,960
Alright, fuck.

2054
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:58,200
Okay, I don't have a car though.

2055
01:26:58,400 --> 01:26:59,500
I don't have a car.

2056
01:26:59,940 --> 01:27:02,000
I don't have a car.

2057
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:06,940
Wait, wait.

2058
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:09,420
Oh, I'm so stupid.

2059
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:10,660
I forgot to mention...

2060
01:27:11,140 --> 01:27:12,460
that this is actually a flat tire.

2061
01:27:12,820 --> 01:27:14,900
Do you have a spare tire inside...

2062
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:15,500
your house?

2063
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:22,180
I don't keep spare tires...

2064
01:27:22,180 --> 01:27:22,580
in my house.

2065
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:23,920
That's more of a garage thing.

2066
01:27:24,140 --> 01:27:25,000
But don't worry.

2067
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:26,180
We can still fix it.

2068
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:28,160
I grab the tools and we can change...

2069
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:28,900
the tire outside.

2070
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:29,820
Sounds good?

2071
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:31,760
Sounds great, Tommy!

2072
01:27:32,060 --> 01:27:33,900
Thank you so much for...

2073
01:27:33,900 --> 01:27:34,680
helping me!

2074
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:36,360
How can I ever...

2075
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:37,300
repay you?

2076
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:39,180
Before I kill you.

2077
01:27:41,980 --> 01:27:44,120
No need to worry about that.

2078
01:27:44,140 --> 01:27:46,080
I'm just happy to help...

2079
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:46,360
up.

2080
01:27:46,620 --> 01:27:48,100
Maybe you can treat me to a cup of...

2081
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:49,380
coffee or something when we're done.

2082
01:27:49,740 --> 01:27:50,580
Oh, teehee.

2083
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:55,720
Fuck, okay.

2084
01:27:56,380 --> 01:27:57,140
It's okay.

2085
01:27:57,240 --> 01:27:57,660
It's okay.

2086
01:27:57,700 --> 01:27:58,040
He'll be...

2087
01:27:58,040 --> 01:27:58,540
dead anyway.

2088
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:06,400
Of course, Tom.

2089
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:07,940
Can I call you Tom?

2090
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:10,040
I would love...

2091
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:12,120
to have a cup of coffee with you.

2092
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:17,580
Sure thing.

2093
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:17,940
Sure thing.

2094
01:28:17,940 --> 01:28:18,880
Tom works for me.

2095
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:20,320
Coffee sounds...

2096
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:20,580
great.

2097
01:28:20,900 --> 01:28:22,080
Let's focus on changing...

2098
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:23,040
that tire first.

2099
01:28:23,260 --> 01:28:24,080
And then we can...

2100
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:26,060
grab that cup of coffee and...

2101
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:27,140
chat some more, deal?

2102
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:29,380
Please just let me in!

2103
01:28:29,700 --> 01:28:30,800
Let me in!

2104
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:32,640
Let me in!

2105
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:42,260
Oh my god.

2106
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:43,960
Oh my god.

2107
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:45,460
Oh my god.

2108
01:28:45,980 --> 01:28:47,760
I'm so tired, Tom.

2109
01:28:48,020 --> 01:28:50,520
Can I rest inside while you help...

2110
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:51,240
me with my car?

2111
01:28:56,440 --> 01:28:57,360
Look, I'm...

2112
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:58,880
I can't let you in my house.

2113
01:28:58,980 --> 01:29:00,260
It's not personal or anything.

2114
01:29:00,620 --> 01:29:02,580
But just don't think it's a good idea.

2115
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:04,560
We can finish fixing your car...

2116
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:06,520
and then you can rest in your own vehicle...

2117
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:08,340
or find a... What the fuck?

2118
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:13,200
Bro!

2119
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:16,360
What do you think I'm gonna fucking steal...

2120
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:16,740
stuff?

2121
01:29:17,660 --> 01:29:18,220
Tom!

2122
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:21,060
You think I'm gonna steal stuff from you, Tom?

2123
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:22,480
Why don't you...

2124
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:23,080
trust me?

2125
01:29:23,660 --> 01:29:25,760
He's hiding something.

2126
01:29:25,980 --> 01:29:27,200
He's fucking hiding something.

2127
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:28,740
He doesn't want me to...

2128
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:29,240
Okay.

2129
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:29,880
Okay.

2130
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:30,740
I'm gonna use the toilet.

2131
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:31,940
Oh my god.

2132
01:29:32,580 --> 01:29:33,740
I need to use the toilet.

2133
01:29:33,780 --> 01:29:34,920
Real quick, Tom.

2134
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:35,360
Please.

2135
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:42,180
I can't let you use my...

2136
01:29:42,180 --> 01:29:44,020
But it's best that you find a nearby...

2137
01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:45,200
public restroom.

2138
01:29:45,540 --> 01:29:46,020
What?

2139
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:48,900
Is he gonna slam the door?

2140
01:29:49,740 --> 01:29:53,080
The coffee!

2141
01:29:59,010 --> 01:29:59,930
I've done it!

2142
01:30:00,010 --> 01:30:01,550
What about the coffee, Tom?

2143
01:30:02,630 --> 01:30:03,110
Tom!

2144
01:30:03,770 --> 01:30:05,910
I see you, fucking bitch!

2145
01:30:05,910 --> 01:30:07,630
What about the coffee?

2146
01:30:11,350 --> 01:30:12,710
What the fuck?

2147
01:30:13,710 --> 01:30:14,610
Oh shit.

2148
01:30:15,110 --> 01:30:16,010
Oh shit.

2149
01:30:16,210 --> 01:30:18,070
He's not gonna come inside, right?

2150
01:30:18,210 --> 01:30:18,790
No, he's not.

2151
01:30:18,850 --> 01:30:19,070
Okay.

2152
01:30:19,650 --> 01:30:19,930
Alright.

2153
01:30:20,070 --> 01:30:21,410
I can't believe it.

2154
01:30:21,530 --> 01:30:23,990
I can't believe he wouldn't give me...

2155
01:30:23,990 --> 01:30:24,990
the fucking coffee.

2156
01:30:25,530 --> 01:30:27,910
I can't believe he would just slam the door on me...

2157
01:30:27,910 --> 01:30:28,230
like that!

2158
01:30:29,170 --> 01:30:30,610
That's so fucked up!

2159
01:30:32,570 --> 01:30:33,070
Alright.

2160
01:30:34,150 --> 01:30:35,110
Oh shit.

2161
01:30:35,190 --> 01:30:35,410
Whoops.

2162
01:30:35,910 --> 01:30:36,970
I didn't see him.

2163
01:30:37,370 --> 01:30:37,810
Woo!

2164
01:30:38,950 --> 01:30:39,950
Don't take my outfit.

2165
01:30:40,010 --> 01:30:40,290
Please.

2166
01:30:40,510 --> 01:30:40,950
Please.

2167
01:30:40,990 --> 01:30:41,990
Don't take the gun!

2168
01:30:42,590 --> 01:30:44,150
Don't take the gun, officer!

2169
01:30:44,370 --> 01:30:45,550
Oh, thank god he didn't take the gun.

2170
01:30:45,650 --> 01:30:46,570
Okay, he didn't take the gun.

2171
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:48,050
He didn't take the gun.

2172
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:51,150
Bro, Tom is so fucking rude.

2173
01:30:51,250 --> 01:30:51,770
Fuck Tommy.

2174
01:30:52,030 --> 01:30:53,570
I'm not gonna talk to Tommy ever again.

2175
01:30:54,630 --> 01:30:55,470
Fuck that guy.

2176
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:02,360
Stop.

2177
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:04,040
Hey there.

2178
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:05,440
What brings a lumberjack...

2179
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:08,120
armed with an AK-47...

2180
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:09,580
to my doorstep?

2181
01:31:10,060 --> 01:31:10,820
Wait, is this Mr. Beast?

2182
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:14,260
That's one way to chop down any unwanted visitors.

2183
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:15,680
Fuck, what does Mr. Beast like?

2184
01:31:20,870 --> 01:31:22,690
Hello, I traveled from Canada...

2185
01:31:22,690 --> 01:31:24,410
just to hand you a singular penny.

2186
01:31:29,150 --> 01:31:31,090
Well, gee golly, thanks!

2187
01:31:31,330 --> 01:31:33,250
I appreciate the effort you put in...

2188
01:31:33,250 --> 01:31:34,990
to traveling all the way here...

2189
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:36,750
just to give me a penny.

2190
01:31:37,170 --> 01:31:39,210
That's some real dedication.

2191
01:31:40,350 --> 01:31:40,870
Alright.

2192
01:31:41,770 --> 01:31:42,290
Um...

2193
01:31:43,390 --> 01:31:45,170
That's not all, Mr. East.

2194
01:31:45,410 --> 01:31:47,630
I also bought all your...

2195
01:31:47,630 --> 01:31:48,930
Mr. East burgers...

2196
01:31:48,930 --> 01:31:50,830
and your Mr. East chocolates.

2197
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:56,300
Oh, wow!

2198
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:58,120
You really went all out, didn't you?

2199
01:31:58,240 --> 01:32:01,380
The Mr. East burgers and chocolates are my pride and joy.

2200
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:03,640
So I'm thrilled to hear you enjoyed them.

2201
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:06,580
You're already a true Mr. East guy.

2202
01:32:11,540 --> 01:32:12,020
Okay.

2203
01:32:12,020 --> 01:32:12,500
Um...

2204
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:13,320
Fuck.

2205
01:32:13,460 --> 01:32:13,740
Okay.

2206
01:32:13,780 --> 01:32:15,080
What else does Mr. East like?

2207
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:17,340
Going on an embarrassed social...

2208
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:19,880
The Mr. East-able.

2209
01:32:20,020 --> 01:32:22,640
The Mr. East-able.

2210
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:25,020
I would love to discuss with you...

2211
01:32:25,020 --> 01:32:26,680
some new ideas...

2212
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:29,140
and flavors for Mr. East-ables.

2213
01:32:33,850 --> 01:32:35,510
That's music to my ears.

2214
01:32:35,610 --> 01:32:37,110
I'm always up for some...

2215
01:32:37,110 --> 01:32:38,250
tasty new ideas.

2216
01:32:38,570 --> 01:32:41,390
Let's brainstorm and create some mind-blowing...

2217
01:32:41,390 --> 01:32:42,390
Mr. East-ables together.

2218
01:32:42,670 --> 01:32:45,630
You definitely earned an invite inside.

2219
01:32:45,750 --> 01:32:46,430
You definitely earned an invite inside.

2220
01:32:49,210 --> 01:32:50,550
Oh my god.

2221
01:32:51,150 --> 01:32:52,270
Oh my god.

2222
01:32:52,270 --> 01:32:52,430
Shit.

2223
01:32:52,610 --> 01:32:52,930
Okay.

2224
01:32:53,070 --> 01:32:54,450
We have to talk to you more?

2225
01:32:54,790 --> 01:32:55,830
That's so easy.

2226
01:32:56,130 --> 01:32:57,450
It's so easy to get...

2227
01:32:57,450 --> 01:32:58,750
into a content creator's house.

2228
01:32:58,870 --> 01:33:01,710
It's actually pretty scary how easy that was.

2229
01:33:06,350 --> 01:33:06,950
Okay.

2230
01:33:07,650 --> 01:33:09,270
I can't wait to...

2231
01:33:09,270 --> 01:33:10,490
feast Mr. East.

2232
01:33:15,330 --> 01:33:15,930
Woohoo!

2233
01:33:15,990 --> 01:33:17,330
Get ready for a feast!

2234
01:33:17,410 --> 01:33:19,170
Of epic proportions, my friend!

2235
01:33:19,330 --> 01:33:21,290
Come on in and let's dive...

2236
01:33:21,290 --> 01:33:22,790
into some mouth-watering...

2237
01:33:22,790 --> 01:33:23,750
East-ables together!

2238
01:33:24,690 --> 01:33:25,170
Alright.

2239
01:33:25,230 --> 01:33:25,550
Nice.

2240
01:33:26,210 --> 01:33:27,570
Little did he know...

2241
01:33:27,570 --> 01:33:29,650
he was a feast all along!

2242
01:33:31,390 --> 01:33:34,030
You'll never expect how this video ends!

2243
01:33:35,010 --> 01:33:35,710
Oh my god.

2244
01:33:35,750 --> 01:33:36,430
I can be Mr. East.

2245
01:33:36,850 --> 01:33:37,330
Okay.

2246
01:33:37,470 --> 01:33:37,910
Wait.

2247
01:33:37,990 --> 01:33:38,450
This is great.

2248
01:33:38,650 --> 01:33:40,110
I can be Mr. East, guys.

2249
01:33:40,850 --> 01:33:41,670
This is great.

2250
01:33:41,890 --> 01:33:43,290
I need to find Mr. East's house.

2251
01:33:43,490 --> 01:33:44,690
It's so fucking gullible.

2252
01:33:45,070 --> 01:33:46,750
I can't believe Mr. East.

2253
01:33:46,870 --> 01:33:47,290
Plus...

2254
01:33:47,410 --> 01:33:47,430
I can't believe this one.

2255
01:33:47,690 --> 01:33:51,470
As a content creator, I knew the inside...

2256
01:33:51,470 --> 01:33:52,670
to a content creator's heart.

2257
01:33:53,910 --> 01:33:54,430
Content.

2258
01:33:58,270 --> 01:33:59,930
I knew what he wanted.

2259
01:34:00,150 --> 01:34:01,310
And he wanted...

2260
01:34:01,310 --> 01:34:01,710
content.

2261
01:34:07,170 --> 01:34:09,110
The East is slain.

2262
01:34:09,710 --> 01:34:10,230
Alright.

2263
01:34:10,290 --> 01:34:11,130
Is this Mr. East?

2264
01:34:11,390 --> 01:34:11,630
Okay.

2265
01:34:11,670 --> 01:34:12,690
Now I'm Mr. East.

2266
01:34:13,190 --> 01:34:13,710
Okay.

2267
01:34:14,910 --> 01:34:16,310
Next victim has...

2268
01:34:16,310 --> 01:34:18,170
speaking rhyme has a challenge.

2269
01:34:18,230 --> 01:34:19,330
Thank you for the super chat.

2270
01:34:19,450 --> 01:34:19,810
Thank you.

2271
01:34:19,850 --> 01:34:20,370
Thank you.

2272
01:34:20,650 --> 01:34:22,150
He got the content.

2273
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:23,530
That's all he wanted.

2274
01:34:24,010 --> 01:34:24,530
Alright.

2275
01:34:24,790 --> 01:34:25,630
What's over there?

2276
01:34:25,930 --> 01:34:26,750
Oh my god.

2277
01:34:26,770 --> 01:34:27,650
Who lives over here?

2278
01:34:28,170 --> 01:34:30,190
Mr. East finally canceled for good...

2279
01:34:30,190 --> 01:34:31,670
after coming up with a plan...

2280
01:34:31,670 --> 01:34:33,530
to feed starving children with...

2281
01:34:33,530 --> 01:34:34,110
Eastables!

2282
01:34:35,930 --> 01:34:36,450
No!

2283
01:34:36,450 --> 01:34:36,970
No!

2284
01:34:37,050 --> 01:34:39,030
You'll never get my fucking...

2285
01:34:39,030 --> 01:34:39,950
Eastie outfit!

2286
01:34:41,970 --> 01:34:42,490
No!

2287
01:34:42,490 --> 01:34:43,330
Leave me alone.

2288
01:34:43,930 --> 01:34:44,890
Leave me alone.

2289
01:34:45,850 --> 01:34:46,850
Leave me alone!

2290
01:34:48,250 --> 01:34:49,290
No, don't come inside.

2291
01:34:49,590 --> 01:34:50,490
Don't come inside.

2292
01:34:50,610 --> 01:34:51,150
Don't come inside.

2293
01:34:51,230 --> 01:34:51,990
He's not gonna take it.

2294
01:34:52,090 --> 01:34:53,310
He's not gonna take my...

2295
01:34:53,310 --> 01:34:53,970
Mr. East outfit.

2296
01:34:54,390 --> 01:34:55,690
He's never gonna take...

2297
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:56,930
my Mr. East outfit.

2298
01:34:57,870 --> 01:34:59,810
No matter what, he'll never be...

2299
01:34:59,810 --> 01:35:00,450
Mr. East.

2300
01:35:02,370 --> 01:35:02,890
Okay.

2301
01:35:02,890 --> 01:35:03,410
Okay.

2302
01:35:04,230 --> 01:35:05,550
Not the neighborhood.

2303
01:35:05,870 --> 01:35:06,290
Watch.

2304
01:35:07,850 --> 01:35:09,390
No one's gonna take my...

2305
01:35:09,390 --> 01:35:10,190
Mr. East outfit!

2306
01:35:12,510 --> 01:35:13,030
Alright.

2307
01:35:13,030 --> 01:35:13,550
Okay.

2308
01:35:13,710 --> 01:35:15,910
We need to... I need to know who lives up there.

2309
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:17,990
I need to know who lives up here.

2310
01:35:18,050 --> 01:35:19,570
Who lives up here in this mansion?

2311
01:35:20,530 --> 01:35:20,970
Toga!

2312
01:35:21,050 --> 01:35:21,950
Welcome to the...

2313
01:35:21,950 --> 01:35:22,610
tomato farm!

2314
01:35:22,710 --> 01:35:23,010
Welcome!

2315
01:35:23,090 --> 01:35:23,430
Welcome!

2316
01:35:26,350 --> 01:35:26,950
Who's this?

2317
01:35:30,730 --> 01:35:31,170
Elamzuck.

2318
01:35:32,070 --> 01:35:32,950
What's popping?

2319
01:35:33,150 --> 01:35:33,470
Like...

2320
01:35:33,470 --> 01:35:36,010
How can I assist you, my tech-savvy...

2321
01:35:36,010 --> 01:35:36,690
amigo?

2322
01:35:42,070 --> 01:35:42,510
Okay.

2323
01:35:46,830 --> 01:35:47,970
Mr. Elam.

2324
01:35:48,070 --> 01:35:49,950
I have a great...

2325
01:35:49,950 --> 01:35:51,790
idea for you for the next...

2326
01:35:51,790 --> 01:35:53,010
big video!

2327
01:35:57,370 --> 01:35:58,770
Oh wow, Mr. East.

2328
01:35:58,950 --> 01:35:59,770
I'm all ears.

2329
01:36:00,070 --> 01:36:01,010
Spill the deets.

2330
01:36:01,190 --> 01:36:03,630
What's this epic video idea that's gonna make...

2331
01:36:03,630 --> 01:36:05,350
waves in the tech world?

2332
01:36:05,830 --> 01:36:06,350
Okay.

2333
01:36:06,530 --> 01:36:06,930
Okay.

2334
01:36:07,210 --> 01:36:07,730
Okay.

2335
01:36:07,730 --> 01:36:08,930
Now I need to think of an actual idea.

2336
01:36:09,190 --> 01:36:09,690
Okay.

2337
01:36:13,170 --> 01:36:13,690
Okay.

2338
01:36:13,690 --> 01:36:13,690
Now I need to think of an actual idea.

2339
01:36:14,510 --> 01:36:15,790
Guys, give me a sec.

2340
01:36:15,970 --> 01:36:17,570
I didn't think he would actually...

2341
01:36:17,570 --> 01:36:19,270
ask me what the idea was.

2342
01:36:19,530 --> 01:36:21,810
I thought I could say that, and then he'll just...

2343
01:36:21,810 --> 01:36:22,790
be like, don't worry.

2344
01:36:22,990 --> 01:36:23,990
Here are the funds.

2345
01:36:25,550 --> 01:36:26,130
That's it.

2346
01:36:30,070 --> 01:36:30,510
Okay.

2347
01:36:33,990 --> 01:36:34,890
Okay, wait.

2348
01:36:35,430 --> 01:36:36,970
Okay, we need to think of a video idea.

2349
01:36:37,010 --> 01:36:39,750
A real video idea that Mr. East...

2350
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:40,310
would do.

2351
01:36:40,870 --> 01:36:41,310
Okay.

2352
01:36:41,590 --> 01:36:43,190
So you know how I was buried.

2353
01:36:43,690 --> 01:36:45,850
Underneath for 24 hours.

2354
01:36:45,990 --> 01:36:47,330
Now imagine...

2355
01:36:47,330 --> 01:36:49,750
I was buried for 24 hours...

2356
01:36:49,750 --> 01:36:50,750
but with iPhones.

2357
01:36:55,510 --> 01:36:57,890
Mr. East, that sounds...

2358
01:36:58,770 --> 01:36:59,330
interesting.

2359
01:37:00,370 --> 01:37:01,570
But I'm not quite sure how...

2360
01:37:01,570 --> 01:37:03,470
burying yourself with an iPhone would be the next big thing.

2361
01:37:03,630 --> 01:37:05,350
Thanks for sharing my brain.

2362
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:07,950
I can't invite you in the moment.

2363
01:37:08,730 --> 01:37:09,650
But this...

2364
01:37:09,650 --> 01:37:10,290
with iPhones!

2365
01:37:14,190 --> 01:37:15,650
It's with an iPhone!

2366
01:37:16,270 --> 01:37:17,870
That's the next big thing!

2367
01:37:18,470 --> 01:37:20,030
That's the new thing!

2368
01:37:22,930 --> 01:37:23,650
Like...

2369
01:37:23,650 --> 01:37:25,690
imagine all the free advertising...

2370
01:37:26,410 --> 01:37:27,030
for iPhone.

2371
01:37:31,790 --> 01:37:33,790
Hello there, Mr. East.

2372
01:37:34,050 --> 01:37:35,990
What brings you to my doorstep...

2373
01:37:35,990 --> 01:37:37,570
at this ungodly hour?

2374
01:37:37,950 --> 01:37:38,490
Okay.

2375
01:37:39,530 --> 01:37:40,430
Congratulations, Karen!

2376
01:37:40,430 --> 01:37:42,390
I will need you...

2377
01:37:42,390 --> 01:37:44,070
to be in my next...

2378
01:37:44,070 --> 01:37:44,770
Mr. East video.

2379
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:51,580
Oh well, isn't that just thrilling?

2380
01:37:51,860 --> 01:37:54,120
But before I make my grand debut...

2381
01:37:54,120 --> 01:37:56,100
I'll need to know all the details.

2382
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:57,760
Who else will be featuring...

2383
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:58,580
alongside me?

2384
01:38:01,700 --> 01:38:03,040
Okay, who else?

2385
01:38:03,180 --> 01:38:04,520
Who's the other...

2386
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:05,460
uh...

2387
01:38:07,020 --> 01:38:07,620
uh...

2388
01:38:07,620 --> 01:38:08,520
stopiplier?

2389
01:38:08,980 --> 01:38:09,580
Stopiplier?

2390
01:38:09,780 --> 01:38:10,580
I don't know.

2391
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:12,000
Markiplier?

2392
01:38:14,300 --> 01:38:15,620
Markiplier?

2393
01:38:15,620 --> 01:38:15,780
What?

2394
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:19,700
What is this world's Markiplier?

2395
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:22,500
Who is this world's Markiplier?

2396
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:30,080
Markiplier?

2397
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:31,820
Regina...

2398
01:38:31,820 --> 01:38:34,180
Elon Musk...

2399
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:37,260
Elon Zuck?

2400
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:38,080
Elon Zuck?

2401
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:41,840
Elon Zuck said...

2402
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:44,020
that he would like to be in this video.

2403
01:38:44,180 --> 01:38:45,700
Imagine being in a video...

2404
01:38:45,700 --> 01:38:47,440
with Elon Zuck, Karen!

2405
01:38:52,340 --> 01:38:53,700
Elon Zuck?

2406
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:54,020
Seriously?

2407
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:54,680
That's not...

2408
01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:55,520
What do you mean?

2409
01:38:55,620 --> 01:38:57,020
I just talked to him!

2410
01:38:58,060 --> 01:38:59,200
Being in some...

2411
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:00,300
silly video with...

2412
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:02,440
He was real, Karen!

2413
01:39:03,140 --> 01:39:04,800
He's real to me!

2414
01:39:08,380 --> 01:39:10,920
He was real to me!

2415
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:13,320
I can't believe it!

2416
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:15,320
I swear he exists!

2417
01:39:16,240 --> 01:39:18,260
Someone will be in my Mr. East video!

2418
01:39:19,260 --> 01:39:19,880
Who's this?

2419
01:39:20,920 --> 01:39:21,780
Well, well, well.

2420
01:39:21,860 --> 01:39:24,080
Look who 5 decides to leave his mom's basement.

2421
01:39:24,220 --> 01:39:27,440
What brings you to the real world, Mr. YouTube Sensation?

2422
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:28,800
Do you find out...

2423
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:31,700
Excuse you, I am Mr. I'm not even gonna talk to her.

2424
01:39:32,020 --> 01:39:32,780
Look at this.

2425
01:39:34,220 --> 01:39:40,120
If she doesn't understand the importance of Mr. East, then she does not deserve to be eaten.

2426
01:39:43,630 --> 01:39:46,210
Hello, Mr. There, Mr. East.

2427
01:39:46,390 --> 01:39:49,390
It's positively delightful to see you at such an hour.

2428
01:39:49,550 --> 01:39:50,750
How simply splendid!

2429
01:39:50,970 --> 01:39:53,050
What brings you to my humble abode, good sir?

2430
01:39:53,990 --> 01:39:55,990
You wanna be in my Mr. East video?

2431
01:40:00,210 --> 01:40:03,410
Oh my, what an honor to be in your Mr. East video!

2432
01:40:03,690 --> 01:40:06,370
I simply cannot contain my excitement!

2433
01:40:06,750 --> 01:40:08,470
Count me in, dear sir!

2434
01:40:09,910 --> 01:40:16,950
To be in my Mr. East video, I need you to sign a contract to make sure we are not liable for your safety.

2435
01:40:17,170 --> 01:40:18,030
Is that okay?

2436
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:24,420
Oh dear, a contract?

2437
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:26,640
That sounds absolutely terrifying!

2438
01:40:27,140 --> 01:40:29,220
I'm afraid I just can't handle the stress!

2439
01:40:29,460 --> 01:40:31,900
I must bid you good farewell, good sir!

2440
01:40:32,020 --> 01:40:34,200
But what about my Mr. East video?

2441
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:36,260
What do you mean?

2442
01:40:36,980 --> 01:40:40,480
No one wants to be in my Mr. East video!

2443
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:46,880
Please, what do you want, Mr. East?

2444
01:40:46,940 --> 01:40:50,060
Can't you see I'm already drowning in the depths of my blackest desire?

2445
01:40:50,440 --> 01:40:52,520
Do you wanna be in my Mr. East video?

2446
01:40:53,740 --> 01:40:56,440
Who would sign a restrictive contract?

2447
01:40:56,900 --> 01:40:57,820
Are you serious?

2448
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,960
You think I wanna be part of your mainstream sellout video?

2449
01:41:01,460 --> 01:41:02,220
No thanks!

2450
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:05,340
I'll stick to my underground edgy scene!

2451
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:12,040
Okay, but Fallout Roy, this video is for the underground edgy scene!

2452
01:41:12,260 --> 01:41:13,680
We're making it different!

2453
01:41:18,470 --> 01:41:19,070
Really?

2454
01:41:19,410 --> 01:41:29,590
Well, if it's really gonna be unique and true to the spirit of the underground scene, then maybe I'll consider it, but don't expect me to sell my soul or compromise my artistic integrity!

2455
01:41:30,150 --> 01:41:31,530
Okay, fuck, okay.

2456
01:41:31,730 --> 01:41:33,810
Any like, artistic people here?

2457
01:41:38,050 --> 01:41:41,070
Who won't compromise their artistic integrity?

2458
01:41:42,370 --> 01:41:44,190
What do they like?

2459
01:41:44,430 --> 01:41:48,950
I'm a... I'm a VTuber, I'm willing to compromise my artistic integrity!

2460
01:41:54,440 --> 01:41:54,960
Okay.

2461
01:41:55,380 --> 01:41:55,900
Alright.

2462
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:56,880
Fuck.

2463
01:41:57,060 --> 01:41:58,400
Okay, I, um...

2464
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:59,800
You know what, Roy?

2465
01:41:59,940 --> 01:42:04,360
Because I like your style, I'll even give you creative control!

2466
01:42:08,590 --> 01:42:09,850
Wait, seriously?

2467
01:42:10,290 --> 01:42:11,210
Creative control?

2468
01:42:11,430 --> 01:42:13,210
That's like the dream, man!

2469
01:42:13,590 --> 01:42:16,590
Alright, you've piqued my interest, I'll let you in.

2470
01:42:16,730 --> 01:42:20,450
But only because you seem to understand the importance of artistic freedom.

2471
01:42:20,650 --> 01:42:22,450
Come on, what the fuck, it was that easy?

2472
01:42:22,690 --> 01:42:23,770
Okay, I'm gonna kill this guy now.

2473
01:42:27,910 --> 01:42:28,710
I'm in!

2474
01:42:28,990 --> 01:42:29,550
I'm in!

2475
01:42:29,570 --> 01:42:31,310
This is so mainstream!

2476
01:42:32,830 --> 01:42:33,950
Holy shit!

2477
01:42:34,030 --> 01:42:35,950
That was actually the easiest!

2478
01:42:36,690 --> 01:42:37,950
That's all it took!

2479
01:42:38,450 --> 01:42:40,430
That's really...

2480
01:42:40,430 --> 01:42:42,350
That's really all it took!

2481
01:42:42,590 --> 01:42:44,530
I just went like, yeah...

2482
01:42:45,990 --> 01:42:47,110
Artistic integrity...

2483
01:42:47,110 --> 01:42:49,170
Was it really that easy?

2484
01:42:51,490 --> 01:42:54,830
Apparently, all they care about is artistic integrity.

2485
01:42:56,090 --> 01:42:57,790
I can't believe it.

2486
01:42:57,810 --> 01:42:59,090
Don't get scammed.

2487
01:43:01,130 --> 01:43:02,390
Oh my god!

2488
01:43:02,990 --> 01:43:04,550
Influencers and artists!

2489
01:43:05,530 --> 01:43:06,250
Please!

2490
01:43:06,430 --> 01:43:08,210
Love yourself more!

2491
01:43:10,110 --> 01:43:10,830
Please!

2492
01:43:13,050 --> 01:43:14,590
Okay, let me...

2493
01:43:14,590 --> 01:43:15,570
Now I look...

2494
01:43:15,570 --> 01:43:16,630
I look fancy.

2495
01:43:19,820 --> 01:43:20,680
Oh, it's Karen.

2496
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:23,200
Oh my gosh, what fabulous surprise!

2497
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:26,040
Are you here to give me a sneak peek of the new spring collection?

2498
01:43:26,360 --> 01:43:27,740
Or maybe spill some...

2499
01:43:27,740 --> 01:43:28,640
Oh no, I'm not.

2500
01:43:28,680 --> 01:43:29,260
I don't wanna talk.

2501
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:30,420
I already went through Regina.

2502
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:34,080
I don't wanna go through another Regina.

2503
01:43:38,340 --> 01:43:40,080
I'm so done.

2504
01:43:40,340 --> 01:43:41,620
Oh my god, wait, that's my shirt!

2505
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:42,800
My shirt!

2506
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:44,680
No more tea!

2507
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:48,000
I'm so done with tea, guys.

2508
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:49,760
I've had...

2509
01:43:49,780 --> 01:43:50,980
I've had enough fill of tea.

2510
01:43:51,180 --> 01:43:51,620
Chat.

2511
01:43:53,660 --> 01:43:54,840
Regina trauma.

2512
01:43:56,780 --> 01:43:57,420
Hello?

2513
01:43:58,380 --> 01:43:59,680
Oh shit, this is Tommy.

2514
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,220
You're the most fabulous I've seen all day.

2515
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:04,480
How about we hit the town and strut your...

2516
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:04,760
Okay.

2517
01:44:04,980 --> 01:44:06,720
Bro, are they all fashion people?

2518
01:44:07,300 --> 01:44:07,940
Please!

2519
01:44:08,500 --> 01:44:11,300
I don't wanna deal with fashion!

2520
01:44:11,560 --> 01:44:13,520
I'm so over it!

2521
01:44:13,540 --> 01:44:16,700
I'm so fucking over fashion right now.

2522
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:18,840
I'm so done.

2523
01:44:19,120 --> 01:44:19,760
I'm so done.

2524
01:44:19,780 --> 01:44:21,480
I don't wanna gossip anymore.

2525
01:44:22,220 --> 01:44:23,340
Oh my god!

2526
01:44:23,640 --> 01:44:27,060
A fellow enthusiast of scientific...

2527
01:44:27,060 --> 01:44:27,880
...eccentry.

2528
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:29,400
Welcome, welcome.

2529
01:44:29,820 --> 01:44:32,440
What brings you to my lair...

2530
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:34,440
...at this ungodly hour?

2531
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:38,820
As a fellow scientist...

2532
01:44:38,820 --> 01:44:40,940
...I've heard about your research...

2533
01:44:40,940 --> 01:44:43,540
...all the way from Canada.

2534
01:44:48,260 --> 01:44:49,180
Canada?

2535
01:45:00,620 --> 01:45:03,760
Fuck, okay.

2536
01:45:04,240 --> 01:45:05,300
What has he done?

2537
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:07,440
Does anyone know what pinky brains have done?

2538
01:45:07,700 --> 01:45:09,560
Does anyone know?

2539
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:14,800
The jetpack!

2540
01:45:16,040 --> 01:45:17,840
Obviously the jetpack.

2541
01:45:18,260 --> 01:45:21,860
No one has been able to successfully jetpack ever.

2542
01:45:22,240 --> 01:45:24,660
You are the first one, sir.

2543
01:45:29,630 --> 01:45:30,790
The jetpack!

2544
01:45:30,930 --> 01:45:33,390
A marvel of modern science indeed.

2545
01:45:34,010 --> 01:45:40,630
But I must admit, my dear friend, the jetpack is just the tip of the iceberg in my grand pla- What?

2546
01:45:44,650 --> 01:45:48,490
How do you fucking do world domination with a fucking jetpack?

2547
01:45:48,710 --> 01:45:49,870
It's a jetpack.

2548
01:45:50,150 --> 01:45:51,990
It's literally like you fly.

2549
01:45:53,090 --> 01:45:55,730
You can't dominate anything with- whatever.

2550
01:45:56,470 --> 01:45:59,330
This scientist ain't so bright, actually.

2551
01:46:01,550 --> 01:46:02,710
Of course!

2552
01:46:03,070 --> 01:46:05,030
Oh my god, you know what?

2553
01:46:05,050 --> 01:46:05,590
You're right.

2554
01:46:05,710 --> 01:46:06,810
Fuck the world.

2555
01:46:08,150 --> 01:46:10,230
I just said that.

2556
01:46:11,870 --> 01:46:12,590
Oh!

2557
01:46:14,490 --> 01:46:17,670
It seems you're feeling rather- Distraught.

2558
01:46:17,690 --> 01:46:20,630
Tries his best, we postpone- What do you mean?

2559
01:46:22,190 --> 01:46:22,830
World!

2560
01:46:26,120 --> 01:46:26,760
What?

2561
01:46:30,180 --> 01:46:32,680
He was gonna dominate the world!

2562
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:33,840
Okay.

2563
01:46:34,420 --> 01:46:36,740
You had him.

2564
01:46:36,840 --> 01:46:38,200
I blew it!

2565
01:46:38,900 --> 01:46:40,520
I blew it!

2566
01:46:41,940 --> 01:46:43,600
So, world domination?

2567
01:46:48,270 --> 01:46:50,810
You caught it to my grand ambition, I see.

2568
01:46:50,870 --> 01:46:51,290
Yes!

2569
01:46:51,350 --> 01:46:51,770
World domination?

2570
01:46:51,770 --> 01:46:51,770
You caught it to my grand ambition, I see.

2571
01:46:51,770 --> 01:46:51,770
Yes!

2572
01:46:51,770 --> 01:46:54,250
World domination is my ultimate goal!

2573
01:46:54,770 --> 01:47:01,410
With my brilliant mind and impeccable sense of style, nothing can stand in my way!

2574
01:47:02,070 --> 01:47:02,710
Okay.

2575
01:47:03,590 --> 01:47:04,230
Okay.

2576
01:47:04,490 --> 01:47:05,470
Okay, we're back here.

2577
01:47:05,750 --> 01:47:09,670
I don't know why he didn't question why I just said world domination.

2578
01:47:10,130 --> 01:47:11,150
But that's okay.

2579
01:47:11,250 --> 01:47:12,090
We're back in it.

2580
01:47:12,230 --> 01:47:13,730
We're back in it.

2581
01:47:13,870 --> 01:47:16,530
He wants to dominate, not destroy.

2582
01:47:16,770 --> 01:47:17,290
Okay.

2583
01:47:17,450 --> 01:47:18,310
Oh yeah, you're right.

2584
01:47:18,790 --> 01:47:19,430
So...

2585
01:47:19,430 --> 01:47:21,750
World domination and change.

2586
01:47:21,750 --> 01:47:22,170
Was that even real?

2587
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:28,520
How dare you mock my craft- What?

2588
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:34,880
Leave me at once before I unleash my fashionable fear.

2589
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,220
What do you mean?

2590
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:39,160
I should never...

2591
01:47:39,160 --> 01:47:39,740
I don't know why.

2592
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,400
You know, this is your fault.

2593
01:47:41,480 --> 01:47:41,920
Whoever...

2594
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:48,140
Whoever's idea that was to say world domination and chill?

2595
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:49,660
That was on you.

2596
01:47:49,860 --> 01:47:51,360
That was on you.

2597
01:47:51,480 --> 01:47:52,160
That was on you.

2598
01:47:52,160 --> 01:47:54,400
That was your fault!

2599
01:47:54,580 --> 01:47:55,920
Alright, I got an idea.

2600
01:47:58,720 --> 01:47:59,840
Okay.

2601
01:48:04,280 --> 01:48:04,840
Hello.

2602
01:48:04,940 --> 01:48:08,020
I come in peace, but also...

2603
01:48:08,660 --> 01:48:09,780
world domination?

2604
01:48:13,640 --> 01:48:20,060
Ah, fellow mastermind with ambitions for world domination!

2605
01:48:20,060 --> 01:48:26,920
I must say, your sense of style and choice of accessories do intrigue me.

2606
01:48:27,120 --> 01:48:31,560
Pray tell, what diabolical plans do you have in mind?

2607
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:34,780
Well, fellow earthling...

2608
01:48:34,780 --> 01:48:40,220
My alien friends and I are planning on abducting the president.

2609
01:48:44,750 --> 01:48:46,890
How dare you suggest such a...

2610
01:48:46,890 --> 01:48:51,130
I will not be part of your misguided attempt to disrupt world order.

2611
01:48:51,510 --> 01:48:51,790
You are...

2612
01:48:51,810 --> 01:48:52,830
Leave at once!

2613
01:48:52,830 --> 01:48:54,030
What do you want?

2614
01:48:54,270 --> 01:48:55,510
Your world domination!

2615
01:48:56,570 --> 01:48:58,010
What do you want?

2616
01:49:03,270 --> 01:49:05,410
If you don't want...

2617
01:49:05,410 --> 01:49:07,650
How are you supposed to do world...

2618
01:49:07,650 --> 01:49:07,970
Okay.

2619
01:49:08,410 --> 01:49:09,770
I'm just gonna ask him.

2620
01:49:09,830 --> 01:49:11,230
I need to know what his plans are.

2621
01:49:11,270 --> 01:49:12,070
Now I'm confused.

2622
01:49:13,370 --> 01:49:15,390
Now I'm fucking confused.

2623
01:49:16,090 --> 01:49:16,870
Why the...

2624
01:49:16,870 --> 01:49:17,530
I don't know!

2625
01:49:17,910 --> 01:49:20,130
What else do you do for world domination?

2626
01:49:23,810 --> 01:49:24,250
Simba!

2627
01:49:24,690 --> 01:49:26,970
What are your plans for world domination?

2628
01:49:30,460 --> 01:49:31,880
What are your plans for world domination?

2629
01:49:31,880 --> 01:49:33,980
Frivollaughing Oh, my dear time-traveling friend.

2630
01:49:34,140 --> 01:49:38,180
World domination is indeed my ultimate goal.

2631
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:39,940
My plan involved...

2632
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:42,140
Jetpack doki!!

2633
01:49:42,140 --> 01:49:43,440
You don't understand!

2634
01:49:43,940 --> 01:49:45,720
It's all about the jetpack.

2635
01:49:46,120 --> 01:49:52,700
Simba laughter My plans involve harnessing the power of Mind Control...

2636
01:49:56,460 --> 01:50:01,080
How is that wor- How is that better than abducting the president?

2637
01:50:01,780 --> 01:50:03,620
Like, how is that better?

2638
01:50:05,480 --> 01:50:07,040
Shouldn't that be worse?

2639
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:08,520
Like...

2640
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:13,240
Okay, just say yes.

2641
01:50:13,380 --> 01:50:13,660
Alright.

2642
01:50:14,900 --> 01:50:15,500
Yes.

2643
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:23,480
Yes.

2644
01:50:26,720 --> 01:50:28,120
Yes.

2645
01:50:52,940 --> 01:50:55,960
And it was that easy.

2646
01:50:56,240 --> 01:50:59,560
All I had to say was yes.

2647
01:51:02,820 --> 01:51:06,200
He just wanted the yes man.

2648
01:51:07,740 --> 01:51:09,400
Oh my god.

2649
01:51:09,860 --> 01:51:12,060
Alright, let's see what love bites is.

2650
01:51:12,280 --> 01:51:14,480
I need to know what love-

2651
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:20,980
Deliver breakup letter and give them advice.

2652
01:51:21,260 --> 01:51:24,560
Watch the drama you caused unfold.

2653
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:27,580
Just keep saying yes.

2654
01:51:27,880 --> 01:51:29,160
Alright, let's break some hearts.

2655
01:51:30,120 --> 01:51:31,680
Wait, that's fun.

2656
01:51:32,140 --> 01:51:32,780
Alright.

2657
01:51:33,580 --> 01:51:34,580
Who are we?

2658
01:51:35,360 --> 01:51:36,340
Grandma Maude.

2659
01:51:38,600 --> 01:51:39,240
Alejandro.

2660
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:41,100
Jay Gatsby.

2661
01:51:41,500 --> 01:51:44,320
Wait, oh my god, what the fu- Hahaha!

2662
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:52,000
Okay, who is- who is- what the fuck- beast?

2663
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:53,900
Oh my god, okay, the beast.

2664
01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:57,940
What do you want, festival creature?

2665
01:51:58,280 --> 01:52:00,680
Stop bothering me and my bell.

2666
01:52:02,100 --> 01:52:04,660
Bell told me you're ugly in the beast form.

2667
01:52:07,980 --> 01:52:09,020
Bell told me you're ugly in the beast form.

2668
01:52:09,020 --> 01:52:09,300
Bell told me you're ugly in the beast form.

2669
01:52:09,300 --> 01:52:11,480
How dare I have no time for your lies!

2670
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:11,800
How dare I have no time for your lies!

2671
01:52:13,040 --> 01:52:15,000
Leave me and my bell alone!

2672
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:15,560
Leave me and my bell alone!

2673
01:52:15,560 --> 01:52:15,600
No!

2674
01:52:15,880 --> 01:52:16,300
Okay.

2675
01:52:18,580 --> 01:52:20,240
You're more like listening to someone that you don't like.

2676
01:52:20,260 --> 01:52:22,220
You don't trust and like, I'm likeable!

2677
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:23,340
Hahaha!

2678
01:52:25,340 --> 01:52:25,800
Hahaha!

2679
01:52:25,820 --> 01:52:25,980
Hahaha!

2680
01:52:27,780 --> 01:52:28,660
Okay, wait.

2681
01:52:29,100 --> 01:52:29,560
Okay.

2682
01:52:30,340 --> 01:52:31,620
Okay, wait, this is it.

2683
01:52:31,680 --> 01:52:31,880
Alright.

2684
01:52:32,260 --> 01:52:33,440
We can do this.

2685
01:52:33,720 --> 01:52:34,180
Okay.

2686
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:35,260
Okay.

2687
01:52:36,860 --> 01:52:38,040
What do you want, human?

2688
01:52:38,220 --> 01:52:40,480
Can't you see I'm trying to enjoy this dreadful party?

2689
01:52:40,680 --> 01:52:41,140
Okay.

2690
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:46,760
I heard from the grapevine that...

2691
01:52:47,960 --> 01:52:49,960
Bell was talking to Gusto.

2692
01:52:51,020 --> 01:52:51,540
Guston.

2693
01:52:51,880 --> 01:52:57,060
I heard from the grapevine that Bell was talking to Guston.

2694
01:52:59,640 --> 01:53:00,160
Hahaha!

2695
01:53:01,700 --> 01:53:04,600
How dare you spread such lies about Bell!

2696
01:53:04,860 --> 01:53:07,280
Leave once before- What?!

2697
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:07,560
Okay.

2698
01:53:08,040 --> 01:53:08,840
Fuck, okay.

2699
01:53:09,280 --> 01:53:10,820
Okay, maybe- Oh!

2700
01:53:10,980 --> 01:53:11,780
Oh, I have an idea!

2701
01:53:12,020 --> 01:53:12,720
I have an idea.

2702
01:53:13,360 --> 01:53:14,380
I have an idea.

2703
01:53:15,780 --> 01:53:19,680
I'll just- I'll like- I'll like, riz him up a little bit so I'm more believable.

2704
01:53:20,260 --> 01:53:21,320
He's so loyal!

2705
01:53:22,580 --> 01:53:25,700
Get that flashy package out before I turn into confetti.

2706
01:53:26,300 --> 01:53:28,620
Hey, you're looking pretty good today, beast!

2707
01:53:33,420 --> 01:53:36,520
Flatter won't save you from the rap-y gun sauce!

2708
01:53:36,740 --> 01:53:40,420
Oh my god, he only has eyes for one person.

2709
01:53:40,890 --> 01:53:42,660
And it's only Bell.

2710
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:43,640
Where's Bell?

2711
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:45,780
Maybe Bell is easier to trick.

2712
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:46,680
Hahaha!

2713
01:53:47,560 --> 01:53:48,700
Where's Bell?

2714
01:53:48,940 --> 01:53:50,440
Where the fuck is Bell?

2715
01:53:50,440 --> 01:53:52,800
Maybe all I have to do is trick Bell.

2716
01:53:54,920 --> 01:53:55,920
He's loyal!

2717
01:53:56,920 --> 01:53:57,480
Hahaha!

2718
01:53:59,340 --> 01:54:02,560
Oh my- Why is he so loyal?!

2719
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:04,040
Where the fuck is Bell?

2720
01:54:05,480 --> 01:54:08,820
Wait, does the police officer have like- Frank?

2721
01:54:09,060 --> 01:54:11,740
Oh hey Frank, who's- move along, citizen.

2722
01:54:13,240 --> 01:54:15,160
Where's- Where's Bell?

2723
01:54:16,840 --> 01:54:19,920
It can't be- Be gone, wench!

2724
01:54:20,220 --> 01:54:20,660
Hahaha!

2725
01:54:23,220 --> 01:54:26,680
There's- I only have eyes for one person.

2726
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:32,140
Where the fuck is- Where the fuck is Bell?

2727
01:54:32,860 --> 01:54:34,580
I can't find her!

2728
01:54:35,300 --> 01:54:36,440
Where is she?

2729
01:54:37,360 --> 01:54:38,020
Hahaha!

2730
01:54:38,820 --> 01:54:40,780
Where the fuck is- is she?

2731
01:54:41,080 --> 01:54:42,580
There's Mr. Darcy?

2732
01:54:45,360 --> 01:54:47,720
Get her to leave, it's easier.

2733
01:54:47,800 --> 01:54:49,880
I know I'm trying to find Bell!

2734
01:54:50,580 --> 01:54:51,180
Hahaha!

2735
01:54:51,820 --> 01:54:53,720
There's Prince Char- Oh there she is!

2736
01:54:53,780 --> 01:54:54,500
There she is!

2737
01:54:54,700 --> 01:54:55,240
Okay.

2738
01:54:56,580 --> 01:54:58,200
Oh la la, bonjour, monsieur!

2739
01:54:58,600 --> 01:55:00,040
What delightful surprise!

2740
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:02,840
May I ask what lovely gift you bring to this- Okay.

2741
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:06,840
You're looking so wonderful in that dress.

2742
01:55:11,690 --> 01:55:13,150
Oh merci, monsieur!

2743
01:55:13,830 --> 01:55:16,750
Your words are as sweet as a French macaron!

2744
01:55:16,750 --> 01:55:20,570
Do you dance the salsa as beautifully as you compliment, perhaps?

2745
01:55:21,050 --> 01:55:22,510
Okay, um...

2746
01:55:23,670 --> 01:55:24,350
Um...

2747
01:55:24,350 --> 01:55:26,370
Oui, mademoiselle?

2748
01:55:26,470 --> 01:55:28,810
Would you care to have a dance with me?

2749
01:55:33,180 --> 01:55:35,120
Oh how f- Oh how f- Bro!

2750
01:55:35,120 --> 01:55:36,720
She's- What the fuck?

2751
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:40,240
The beast has eyes for one person.

2752
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:41,960
But Bell...

2753
01:55:42,340 --> 01:55:44,840
Bell is willing to dance with me!

2754
01:55:45,220 --> 01:55:48,980
She ain't so innocent as we thought she was!

2755
01:55:49,100 --> 01:55:49,720
Hahaha!

2756
01:55:51,600 --> 01:55:52,300
Hahaha!

2757
01:55:53,360 --> 01:55:53,680
Hahaha!

2758
01:56:00,080 --> 01:56:02,720
The beast deserves better!

2759
01:56:03,320 --> 01:56:05,260
Fuck, okay, what do we tell her?

2760
01:56:05,640 --> 01:56:06,340
Hahaha!

2761
01:56:06,340 --> 01:56:08,200
She's for the streets.

2762
01:56:08,480 --> 01:56:09,880
Oh my god!

2763
01:56:11,260 --> 01:56:11,960
Alright.

2764
01:56:12,540 --> 01:56:13,240
Hahaha!

2765
01:56:14,220 --> 01:56:14,920
Hahaha!

2766
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:21,460
Madame, did I ever tell you how beautiful you look?

2767
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:22,380
In the moonlight?

2768
01:56:26,850 --> 01:56:28,210
Oh monsieur!

2769
01:56:28,490 --> 01:56:33,890
Your words are like sonnets set in the romantic light of the moon!

2770
01:56:34,110 --> 01:56:36,510
What a charming heart you have!

2771
01:56:36,790 --> 01:56:40,230
Tell me, do you truly believe such words?

2772
01:56:40,390 --> 01:56:44,790
Or do you simply have the tongue of a silvered serpent?

2773
01:56:45,530 --> 01:56:46,570
Oh my god!

2774
01:56:46,730 --> 01:56:49,990
Beast, you deserve so much better!

2775
01:56:52,590 --> 01:56:56,490
Why, mademoiselle, of course I speak the truth.

2776
01:56:56,750 --> 01:56:59,990
You are the most beautiful woman I've seen tonight.

2777
01:57:00,550 --> 01:57:00,890
Hahaha!

2778
01:57:04,670 --> 01:57:11,730
Oh monsieur, your words warm my heart like a cozy fire on a winter eve.

2779
01:57:12,090 --> 01:57:18,170
Tell me, do you see me as more than just a pretty face in this dazzling ballroom?

2780
01:57:19,670 --> 01:57:21,470
Of course, mademoiselle.

2781
01:57:22,670 --> 01:57:26,650
It's not just your looks, but your brain as well.

2782
01:57:26,990 --> 01:57:29,250
You are truly an intellectual.

2783
01:57:31,610 --> 01:57:32,230
Hahaha!

2784
01:57:33,770 --> 01:57:34,390
Oh!

2785
01:57:35,250 --> 01:57:39,350
Pardon, monsieur, but your words ring hollow like an empty carriage.

2786
01:57:39,510 --> 01:57:42,470
What use is flattery if it falls upon ears already worried?

2787
01:57:42,630 --> 01:57:44,090
I must take my leave now.

2788
01:57:44,210 --> 01:57:44,570
No!

2789
01:57:44,750 --> 01:57:45,790
I was so close!

2790
01:57:46,370 --> 01:57:47,750
I was so close!

2791
01:57:48,130 --> 01:57:48,670
Hahaha!

2792
01:57:50,790 --> 01:57:51,410
Hahaha!

2793
01:57:53,030 --> 01:57:53,350
No!

2794
01:57:55,290 --> 01:57:56,850
I choked!

2795
01:57:56,850 --> 01:58:00,710
She doesn't like to be complimented about her brain?

2796
01:58:01,210 --> 01:58:02,490
Question mark?

2797
01:58:03,670 --> 01:58:06,910
She doesn't like to be said that she's smart?

2798
01:58:07,270 --> 01:58:08,050
Hahaha!

2799
01:58:09,630 --> 01:58:10,410
Hahaha!

2800
01:58:11,110 --> 01:58:14,290
The word brain is not romantic.

2801
01:58:15,550 --> 01:58:17,930
I will save the beast.

2802
01:58:18,660 --> 01:58:19,770
Oh my god.

2803
01:58:19,810 --> 01:58:22,670
I can't believe brain isn't considered romantic.

2804
01:58:24,910 --> 01:58:25,470
Okay.

2805
01:58:25,810 --> 01:58:28,530
Where do you find such fabulous attire?

2806
01:58:28,770 --> 01:58:29,330
Okay.

2807
01:58:30,730 --> 01:58:31,290
Um.

2808
01:58:31,850 --> 01:58:34,610
I was inspired by you, Belle!

2809
01:58:35,070 --> 01:58:37,510
You're looking gorgeous tonight!

2810
01:58:38,390 --> 01:58:38,950
Hahaha!

2811
01:58:41,970 --> 01:58:43,650
Oh, you're too kind, mon ami.

2812
01:58:43,930 --> 01:58:44,850
Merci beaucoup!

2813
01:58:45,350 --> 01:58:48,010
Do tell me, did you learn any dance moves for tonight's celebration?

2814
01:58:48,210 --> 01:58:49,030
Okay, I can try this again.

2815
01:58:49,550 --> 01:58:50,510
Of course!

2816
01:58:50,790 --> 01:58:55,350
And can I kindly ask you to be my dance partner tonight?

2817
01:59:00,100 --> 01:59:01,300
Oh la la!

2818
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:04,240
You just dance with me just like that, Belle?

2819
01:59:04,920 --> 01:59:06,840
Bro, he's right there!

2820
01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:07,540
Belle!

2821
01:59:08,080 --> 01:59:09,880
He's right there!

2822
01:59:10,680 --> 01:59:11,000
Hahaha!

2823
01:59:13,520 --> 01:59:14,160
Hahaha!

2824
01:59:16,420 --> 01:59:19,080
Oh, Freda, welcome to the tomato farm!

2825
01:59:19,220 --> 01:59:20,140
Welcome, welcome!

2826
01:59:22,720 --> 01:59:23,360
Um.

2827
01:59:23,560 --> 01:59:23,880
Okay.

2828
01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:27,120
Yes, of course, mademoiselle!

2829
01:59:27,420 --> 01:59:29,840
Let me sweep you off your feet!

2830
01:59:35,310 --> 01:59:35,870
Mandeux!

2831
01:59:35,930 --> 01:59:37,090
You are so charming!

2832
01:59:37,330 --> 01:59:42,910
I cannot wait to dance with you, but tell me, have you always been such a smooth salsa dancer?

2833
01:59:44,050 --> 01:59:44,610
Um.

2834
01:59:44,850 --> 01:59:45,690
Fuck, okay.

2835
01:59:46,150 --> 01:59:46,710
Um.

2836
01:59:46,930 --> 01:59:47,430
Hahaha!

2837
01:59:49,250 --> 01:59:56,310
We all had to start somewhere, but you, Belle, you inspire me to improve, mon ami!

2838
01:59:56,690 --> 01:59:57,250
Hahaha!

2839
01:59:58,450 --> 01:59:59,090
Hahaha!

2840
02:00:01,090 --> 02:00:03,610
Oh, how sweet of you to say!

2841
02:00:04,010 --> 02:00:06,310
Delightful to have inspired you!

2842
02:00:06,410 --> 02:00:10,270
Tell me what motivates you the most in your salsa dancing journey?

2843
02:00:10,650 --> 02:00:11,310
Um.

2844
02:00:13,490 --> 02:00:17,870
My motivation is please stop!

2845
02:00:18,950 --> 02:00:19,750
Hahaha!

2846
02:00:20,870 --> 02:00:21,030
Hahaha!

2847
02:00:22,110 --> 02:00:22,510
Hahaha!

2848
02:00:24,910 --> 02:00:27,890
This feels like a job interview!

2849
02:00:28,590 --> 02:00:29,230
Okay.

2850
02:00:29,390 --> 02:00:31,270
No, I'm not gonna fumble it!

2851
02:00:31,430 --> 02:00:35,370
I am not gonna fumble it this time!

2852
02:00:35,970 --> 02:00:36,610
Hahaha!

2853
02:00:38,610 --> 02:00:39,250
Okay.

2854
02:00:39,550 --> 02:00:40,190
Um.

2855
02:00:40,390 --> 02:00:43,330
What motivates you the most in your salsa dancing journey?

2856
02:00:43,570 --> 02:00:50,790
When I close my eyes, mon ami, I imagine being able to dance with you in the future, just like today!

2857
02:00:51,410 --> 02:00:52,050
Hahaha!

2858
02:00:55,190 --> 02:00:58,150
Well, words are like poetry, monsieur!

2859
02:00:58,430 --> 02:01:02,890
I imagine our future dances together fill my heart with joy!

2860
02:01:03,290 --> 02:01:08,110
Let's continue dancing and dreaming together, shall we?

2861
02:01:09,750 --> 02:01:10,930
Why, of course, monsieur!

2862
02:01:11,270 --> 02:01:12,790
Take my hand!

2863
02:01:13,530 --> 02:01:13,770
Hahaha!

2864
02:01:17,630 --> 02:01:18,350
Enchanté!

2865
02:01:18,630 --> 02:01:21,410
Let's dance our hearts out, mon ami!

2866
02:01:22,510 --> 02:01:24,570
Bro, he's like right there!

2867
02:01:24,790 --> 02:01:25,370
Yeah!

2868
02:01:26,130 --> 02:01:27,670
He's like right there!

2869
02:01:27,950 --> 02:01:29,030
I can't!

2870
02:01:30,750 --> 02:01:32,490
Just say yes!

2871
02:01:34,750 --> 02:01:36,030
Oui, madem...

2872
02:01:36,030 --> 02:01:37,290
Oui, belle!

2873
02:01:38,710 --> 02:01:39,510
Hahaha!

2874
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:40,930
Hahaha!

2875
02:01:43,190 --> 02:01:45,070
Oui, oui, belle!

2876
02:01:45,590 --> 02:01:46,010
Hahaha!

2877
02:01:47,690 --> 02:01:48,490
No!

2878
02:01:48,890 --> 02:01:49,930
Ah oui!

2879
02:01:50,010 --> 02:01:52,350
Let's twirl and roll with passion and grace, monsieur!

2880
02:01:52,590 --> 02:01:56,810
Our dance is like a beautiful story unfolding before our eyes!

2881
02:01:58,370 --> 02:01:58,870
Okay!

2882
02:01:59,310 --> 02:02:01,350
Oui, oui!

2883
02:02:01,890 --> 02:02:03,390
Okay, okay, we have to...

2884
02:02:03,390 --> 02:02:06,930
Okay, we have to make her break up with Mr. Beast.

2885
02:02:07,530 --> 02:02:08,950
Mr. Beast!

2886
02:02:10,570 --> 02:02:11,930
Belle, we can't!

2887
02:02:11,950 --> 02:02:12,970
This is forbidden!

2888
02:02:13,310 --> 02:02:15,810
You have to end it with hit-miss!

2889
02:02:16,130 --> 02:02:18,510
With the Beast, if we have, we can be together!

2890
02:02:18,810 --> 02:02:20,090
Okay, is that...

2891
02:02:20,090 --> 02:02:24,730
Do you think I'm... Do you think we're at the stage where she will break up with the Beast?

2892
02:02:26,130 --> 02:02:27,510
Do you think we're at that stage?

2893
02:02:27,590 --> 02:02:28,670
Do you think?

2894
02:02:29,930 --> 02:02:30,470
Hahaha!

2895
02:02:32,310 --> 02:02:32,850
No?

2896
02:02:34,590 --> 02:02:36,130
Belle, what do I say?

2897
02:02:36,450 --> 02:02:37,510
Too far?

2898
02:02:37,990 --> 02:02:38,730
Not yet!

2899
02:02:38,910 --> 02:02:39,910
What do I say, though?

2900
02:02:40,050 --> 02:02:40,790
Too fast?

2901
02:02:43,410 --> 02:02:47,490
Belle, do you feel the same way I do about you?

2902
02:02:47,850 --> 02:02:48,330
Hahaha!

2903
02:02:52,590 --> 02:02:54,790
Your question brings a cloud of doubt!

2904
02:02:54,870 --> 02:02:56,530
If only I could be completely sure!

2905
02:02:56,710 --> 02:02:58,190
I need to be a moment!

2906
02:02:58,650 --> 02:02:58,730
No!

2907
02:03:01,870 --> 02:03:02,530
No!

2908
02:03:13,950 --> 02:03:14,230
No!

2909
02:03:17,270 --> 02:03:17,870
Belle, no!

2910
02:03:18,590 --> 02:03:19,250
No!

2911
02:03:22,340 --> 02:03:24,040
We were so close!

2912
02:03:24,660 --> 02:03:25,740
Belle, please!

2913
02:03:25,800 --> 02:03:26,920
Break up with him!

2914
02:03:30,180 --> 02:03:32,200
What's so just is delivery driver!

2915
02:03:32,620 --> 02:03:33,260
Okay.

2916
02:03:34,460 --> 02:03:36,940
Mon ami, I have a package for you.

2917
02:03:37,220 --> 02:03:37,880
Hahaha!

2918
02:03:41,380 --> 02:03:44,000
Excusez-moi, but I do not recall any packages.

2919
02:03:44,260 --> 02:03:45,140
I must bid you a...

2920
02:03:45,140 --> 02:03:46,620
But you had the plus!

2921
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:47,360
Hahaha!

2922
02:03:51,140 --> 02:03:52,540
Oh my god!

2923
02:03:52,780 --> 02:03:54,300
We were so close!

2924
02:03:54,680 --> 02:03:56,600
We were so fucking close!

2925
02:03:57,580 --> 02:03:58,340
We were so fucking close!

2926
02:03:58,340 --> 02:04:00,080
Keep it simple and true.

2927
02:04:00,300 --> 02:04:01,660
The fumble!

2928
02:04:02,700 --> 02:04:03,900
Belle, please!

2929
02:04:04,080 --> 02:04:04,940
Leave him!

2930
02:04:06,580 --> 02:04:10,200
What a surprise to see you here at the Valentine Park dressed as a therapist!

2931
02:04:10,440 --> 02:04:12,680
What secrets do you hope to recover, mon ami?

2932
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:13,480
Okay.

2933
02:04:15,500 --> 02:04:19,520
As your therapist, I wanted to ask you if you are okay.

2934
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:20,320
Okay.

2935
02:04:20,820 --> 02:04:23,980
As your therapist, I wanted to ask you if you are okay.

2936
02:04:24,900 --> 02:04:25,380
Hahaha!

2937
02:04:28,900 --> 02:04:29,800
Oh la la!

2938
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,620
I'm touched by your concern, Monsieur Therapist.

2939
02:04:32,620 --> 02:04:34,060
I'm quite alright.

2940
02:04:34,260 --> 02:04:37,020
Just a little bored with the lack of excitement in my life.

2941
02:04:37,180 --> 02:04:40,020
Do you have any thrilling stories to share with you?

2942
02:04:40,340 --> 02:04:41,360
Do you have any thrilling stories to share with you?

2943
02:04:41,380 --> 02:04:41,920
No.

2944
02:04:42,040 --> 02:04:42,380
Okay.

2945
02:04:42,640 --> 02:04:46,900
For like, this breaks all confidentialities between patient and therapist.

2946
02:04:47,200 --> 02:04:53,020
And also I'm pretty sure like, it's very illegal for a therapist to like, try to date their patients too.

2947
02:04:53,240 --> 02:04:54,320
So, anyway.

2948
02:04:55,540 --> 02:04:56,080
Um.

2949
02:04:56,560 --> 02:04:59,680
Well, I have an exciting story to tell you.

2950
02:04:59,780 --> 02:05:00,740
I think...

2951
02:05:00,740 --> 02:05:02,020
I think I have a crush.

2952
02:05:02,620 --> 02:05:03,640
On one of my clients.

2953
02:05:08,050 --> 02:05:09,370
Oh la la!

2954
02:05:09,650 --> 02:05:13,050
A forbidden love story between therapist and client?

2955
02:05:13,630 --> 02:05:15,170
Quelle intrigue!

2956
02:05:15,210 --> 02:05:21,030
Tell me more about this mysterious amour that's captured your heart, Monsieur Therapist.

2957
02:05:21,490 --> 02:05:22,790
The tea!

2958
02:05:24,150 --> 02:05:25,750
She wears a...

2959
02:05:25,750 --> 02:05:29,730
She wears a crown and a beautiful white dress.

2960
02:05:30,030 --> 02:05:30,790
But...

2961
02:05:30,790 --> 02:05:33,910
She's taken by another beast.

2962
02:05:37,490 --> 02:05:38,210
She's taken by another beast.

2963
02:05:38,210 --> 02:05:38,270
She's taken by another beast.

2964
02:05:38,270 --> 02:05:38,350
Hello!

2965
02:05:39,690 --> 02:05:42,910
This tale of unrequited love touches my heart.

2966
02:05:43,070 --> 02:05:46,830
Have you tried discussing your feelings with someone you trust, Monsieur...

2967
02:05:48,210 --> 02:05:49,490
Monsieur Therapist?

2968
02:05:51,230 --> 02:05:53,010
This is illegal.

2969
02:05:57,490 --> 02:05:58,410
It's yellow?

2970
02:05:58,530 --> 02:05:59,330
It's white!

2971
02:05:59,750 --> 02:06:00,870
What do you mean?

2972
02:06:00,870 --> 02:06:02,450
It's the lighting!

2973
02:06:02,910 --> 02:06:04,090
It's the lighting.

2974
02:06:05,510 --> 02:06:06,030
Yes.

2975
02:06:06,590 --> 02:06:08,470
Yes, this is why I told you.

2976
02:06:08,570 --> 02:06:10,270
I trust you a lot, Belle.

2977
02:06:15,230 --> 02:06:16,030
Oh la la!

2978
02:06:16,430 --> 02:06:20,610
I am honored, but I must admit I'm feeling a tad flustered by the weight of your feelings.

2979
02:06:20,830 --> 02:06:24,830
Perhaps we should focus on helping you navigate this delicate situation first.

2980
02:06:25,510 --> 02:06:26,210
Fuck, okay.

2981
02:06:26,490 --> 02:06:27,490
Okay, okay.

2982
02:06:27,490 --> 02:06:32,130
What do you think I should do about this unrequited love?

2983
02:06:38,070 --> 02:06:46,690
Perhaps expressing your feelings honestly, yet respectfully, could lead to resolution, resolution, n'est-ce pas?

2984
02:06:47,170 --> 02:06:47,650
Okay.

2985
02:06:47,990 --> 02:06:48,770
Um...

2986
02:06:48,770 --> 02:06:49,910
Um...

2987
02:06:49,910 --> 02:06:50,010
Um...

2988
02:06:50,010 --> 02:06:50,530
Um...

2989
02:06:59,870 --> 02:07:00,270
Okay.

2990
02:07:04,670 --> 02:07:05,070
Yes.

2991
02:07:09,290 --> 02:07:09,690
No!

2992
02:07:10,810 --> 02:07:13,450
It not be time to have a catty with the object you're first.

2993
02:07:13,590 --> 02:07:17,670
And as for me, I realize that it might be time to write a letter of my own to my own beast.

2994
02:07:20,010 --> 02:07:20,410
No!

2995
02:07:20,510 --> 02:07:20,850
Wait.

2996
02:07:20,850 --> 02:07:20,990
Wait.

2997
02:07:20,990 --> 02:07:24,450
It has come that my therapist has a crush on a client who is taken by another beast.

2998
02:07:24,630 --> 02:07:28,290
Making me realize it's time for me to go on my own goodbye dear.

2999
02:07:28,470 --> 02:07:28,970
Oh wait!

3000
02:07:29,010 --> 02:07:29,490
That worked!

3001
02:07:30,050 --> 02:07:30,550
That worked!

3002
02:07:31,150 --> 02:07:32,690
I made her realize...

3003
02:07:32,690 --> 02:07:33,410
I did it!

3004
02:07:35,630 --> 02:07:36,110
Wait!

3005
02:07:36,210 --> 02:07:37,230
That doesn't make sense!

3006
02:07:37,610 --> 02:07:38,750
I did it though!

3007
02:07:39,630 --> 02:07:40,830
I did it!

3008
02:07:44,660 --> 02:07:46,540
I just said yes!

3009
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:48,740
I just said yes!

3010
02:07:49,400 --> 02:07:50,420
Oh my god!

3011
02:07:50,980 --> 02:07:51,460
Okay.

3012
02:07:51,500 --> 02:07:52,480
It has a crush on me.

3013
02:07:52,500 --> 02:07:53,420
She was taken by another...

3014
02:07:53,420 --> 02:07:56,240
Making me realize it's time for me to go on my own adventure.

3015
02:07:56,800 --> 02:07:59,280
Hey, I know you're having a great time dancing.

3016
02:07:59,480 --> 02:08:00,640
But here's a letter.

3017
02:08:01,540 --> 02:08:02,860
Hello, I'm from...

3018
02:08:05,990 --> 02:08:09,570
Because some crush you have on Tal who is with another beast.

3019
02:08:10,530 --> 02:08:13,150
I think it's not fair what she did to you.

3020
02:08:17,910 --> 02:08:21,070
And demanded explanation for her actions.

3021
02:08:22,270 --> 02:08:23,010
Is that it?

3022
02:08:23,310 --> 02:08:24,030
Is that it?

3023
02:08:26,310 --> 02:08:27,750
Hello, I'm from...

3024
02:08:27,750 --> 02:08:30,190
You've been so distant and cold lately.

3025
02:08:30,330 --> 02:08:31,830
I can't take it anymore.

3026
02:08:33,850 --> 02:08:36,450
I think it's not fair what she did to you.

3027
02:08:36,610 --> 02:08:39,070
But now I think we should break up.

3028
02:08:39,170 --> 02:08:40,450
I can't do this anymore.

3029
02:08:41,430 --> 02:08:42,390
Break up?

3030
02:08:42,710 --> 02:08:43,230
Fine!

3031
02:08:43,410 --> 02:08:46,130
I saw the way you were eyeing that enchanted teapot.

3032
02:08:46,230 --> 02:08:48,390
And don't think I didn't notice that...

3033
02:08:48,390 --> 02:08:49,850
Oh my god!

3034
02:08:51,670 --> 02:08:53,950
I just want to thank them for the hard work.

3035
02:08:54,130 --> 02:08:55,510
But now I think we should...

3036
02:08:55,510 --> 02:08:57,530
For a teapot?

3037
02:09:01,310 --> 02:09:03,830
Please, I am done with this nonsense.

3038
02:09:04,070 --> 02:09:06,930
I don't want to be with someone who can't appreciate a good fairytale romance.

3039
02:09:08,130 --> 02:09:09,370
Fine, be that way.

3040
02:09:09,470 --> 02:09:10,890
I'll just be...

3041
02:09:10,890 --> 02:09:13,930
Go back to the castle and sulk with Lumiere and Cogsworth.

3042
02:09:14,170 --> 02:09:15,850
At least they understand me.

3043
02:09:16,270 --> 02:09:17,610
Goodbye, Bella.

3044
02:09:19,010 --> 02:09:20,950
Yay, I did it.

3045
02:09:21,150 --> 02:09:22,730
I did it.

3046
02:09:25,510 --> 02:09:27,050
Yay, a happy ending.

3047
02:09:27,530 --> 02:09:29,070
I did it.

3048
02:09:34,910 --> 02:09:36,350
Mrs. Potts?

3049
02:09:36,410 --> 02:09:37,830
A teapot?

3050
02:09:38,510 --> 02:09:40,010
What the fuck?

3051
02:09:40,610 --> 02:09:41,330
Yay!

3052
02:09:43,630 --> 02:09:45,350
No love for you.

3053
02:09:46,110 --> 02:09:47,850
Look, he's dancing though.

3054
02:09:48,030 --> 02:09:50,030
He seems to be having a good time dancing.

3055
02:09:50,630 --> 02:09:51,670
Are you okay?

3056
02:09:51,970 --> 02:09:53,110
Are you okay, Beast?

3057
02:09:54,170 --> 02:09:56,390
What did I just witness?

3058
02:09:56,730 --> 02:09:57,670
I don't know.

3059
02:09:57,810 --> 02:09:59,630
I should have just said yes earlier.

3060
02:09:59,830 --> 02:10:02,750
I feel like just saying yes just solves all my problems.

3061
02:10:03,910 --> 02:10:05,530
See what I thought.

3062
02:10:07,010 --> 02:10:09,590
He's dancing his pain away.

3063
02:10:10,210 --> 02:10:11,450
Oh my god.

3064
02:10:11,790 --> 02:10:14,950
I didn't realize all I had to do was say yes.

3065
02:10:15,170 --> 02:10:15,870
That's all.

3066
02:10:16,070 --> 02:10:18,510
I think that's a good way to call it.

3067
02:10:18,690 --> 02:10:20,370
I think that's a good way.

3068
02:10:24,180 --> 02:10:24,840
Freaking out.

3069
02:10:24,840 --> 02:10:26,660
Beauty and the Beast.

3070
02:10:26,840 --> 02:10:27,660
I did it!

3071
02:10:27,820 --> 02:10:31,020
I will never trust a therapist anymore.

3072
02:10:31,500 --> 02:10:33,420
Luv, thank you for the super chat.

3073
02:10:33,580 --> 02:10:34,020
Thank you.

3074
02:10:34,020 --> 02:10:34,680
Thank you.

3075
02:10:35,080 --> 02:10:37,260
With the power of yes.

3076
02:10:37,640 --> 02:10:40,000
That's really all it took, guys.

3077
02:10:40,100 --> 02:10:42,060
Just keep saying yes.

3078
02:10:46,160 --> 02:10:48,080
What the fuck?

3079
02:10:48,600 --> 02:10:51,160
It's so much better than Twilight.

3080
02:10:51,660 --> 02:10:53,020
Just... yes.

3081
02:10:53,580 --> 02:10:55,000
That was fun though.

3082
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,240
So, that was really really fun.

3083
02:10:57,460 --> 02:10:58,720
I don't know what...

3084
02:11:01,620 --> 02:11:03,180
Oh my god.

3085
02:11:03,960 --> 02:11:05,360
Holy shit.

3086
02:11:05,480 --> 02:11:06,440
That was...

3087
02:11:09,080 --> 02:11:12,140
That was actually so fucking funny though.

3088
02:11:17,640 --> 02:11:19,160
But that...

3089
02:11:25,820 --> 02:11:31,640
I actually did not expect how fun it was to just mess around with chat...

3090
02:11:31,640 --> 02:11:37,320
to mess around with chat GPT slash AI and just fucking...

3091
02:11:37,940 --> 02:11:40,480
The type of conversations...

3092
02:11:40,930 --> 02:11:44,780
The type of conversations we have with AI.

3093
02:11:46,060 --> 02:11:48,700
But yeah, that was... I hope you guys enjoyed that.

3094
02:11:48,800 --> 02:11:52,620
I know some of you were asking if I figured out my Pal World Twitch Rivals team.

3095
02:11:52,700 --> 02:11:54,380
I have not, except for...

3096
02:11:54,380 --> 02:11:54,980
Shrek.

3097
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:55,460
Shrek 4...

3098
02:11:57,080 --> 02:12:00,420
I asked Shrek 4 if he wanted to join me because...

3099
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,100
He really really likes Pal World.

3100
02:12:03,460 --> 02:12:07,060
So, that is the only teammate I have confirmed right now.

3101
02:12:07,220 --> 02:12:10,400
That is the only teammate I have confirmed in Pal World.

3102
02:12:11,040 --> 02:12:14,600
For those who are wondering what is the tournament going to be like...

3103
02:12:14,600 --> 02:12:17,540
It's like... It's basically like an achievement run thing.

3104
02:12:17,680 --> 02:12:20,220
So, they're going to give us like a list of achievements.

3105
02:12:20,380 --> 02:12:22,220
And then we're supposed to...

3106
02:12:24,220 --> 02:12:29,940
We're supposed to like try and see how many achievements we can get done in like two days basically.

3107
02:12:30,180 --> 02:12:32,980
So, it's going to be very interesting because I was like...

3108
02:12:32,980 --> 02:12:35,220
Oh, wow, Pal World Twitch Rivals.

3109
02:12:35,340 --> 02:12:36,760
How the fuck that's going to work?

3110
02:12:37,200 --> 02:12:38,420
Alright, thank you for the super chat.

3111
02:12:38,540 --> 02:12:38,820
Thank you.

3112
02:12:38,840 --> 02:12:39,420
Thank you.

3113
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:43,920
But yes, I have no confirmations on who else will be my teammates.

3114
02:12:44,400 --> 02:12:48,200
I haven't really looked at like people who asked yet.

3115
02:12:48,260 --> 02:12:50,940
I really haven't looked on my Twitter thread.

3116
02:12:50,940 --> 02:12:52,840
So, I'll figure that out later.

3117
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:53,420
Also!

3118
02:12:53,860 --> 02:12:56,660
Also, I'm really excited about the charity auction.

3119
02:12:56,800 --> 02:13:00,660
Because there's a lot of like amazing talented creators that wanted to like...

3120
02:13:02,860 --> 02:13:09,440
Wanted to like help out and work with me on collabing on some one of a kind Doki items.

3121
02:13:10,020 --> 02:13:11,600
We actually had like...

3122
02:13:11,600 --> 02:13:14,820
I was talking about this on the chat... the waiting room chat.

3123
02:13:15,120 --> 02:13:18,580
But basically like I grew up with watching...

3124
02:13:18,580 --> 02:13:19,040
Not grew up, sorry.

3125
02:13:19,160 --> 02:13:20,620
I loved watching like...

3126
02:13:20,620 --> 02:13:21,980
Custom doll customization.

3127
02:13:22,180 --> 02:13:23,960
Like those who like customize like...

3128
02:13:23,960 --> 02:13:24,580
You know...

3129
02:13:24,580 --> 02:13:25,040
Um...

3130
02:13:25,040 --> 02:13:26,020
What is it called?

3131
02:13:26,540 --> 02:13:27,020
The...

3132
02:13:27,020 --> 02:13:27,580
The...

3133
02:13:27,580 --> 02:13:28,240
Fuck!

3134
02:13:28,460 --> 02:13:28,880
What is that?

3135
02:13:28,940 --> 02:13:30,120
Like the Monster High...

3136
02:13:30,120 --> 02:13:30,540
Monster High!

3137
02:13:30,780 --> 02:13:33,680
Like those that did like Monster High dolls and stuff.

3138
02:13:33,920 --> 02:13:38,380
And they customize Monster High dolls to like make it look into like different things.

3139
02:13:38,560 --> 02:13:41,640
Like I used to watch a lot of Doll Life and stuff like that.

3140
02:13:41,800 --> 02:13:42,900
So, um...

3141
02:13:42,900 --> 02:13:46,440
A custom doll maker actually reached out to me.

3142
02:13:46,580 --> 02:13:47,800
And said they'll make a...

3143
02:13:47,800 --> 02:13:49,040
Yeah, ball jointed dolls.

3144
02:13:49,180 --> 02:13:49,780
Like they'll make...

3145
02:13:49,780 --> 02:13:53,500
They want to make a custom Doki ball jointed doll to sell for the auction.

3146
02:13:54,060 --> 02:13:54,860
Which is...

3147
02:13:54,860 --> 02:13:55,380
Um...

3148
02:13:55,380 --> 02:13:56,460
Which will be really fun.

3149
