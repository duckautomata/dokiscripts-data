00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,360
Okay, I started.

2
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,300
Everybody started?

3
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,020
Are we all here?

4
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:03,720
Hello!

5
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:05,860
Hello everybody!

6
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,360
Hello everyone!

7
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:09,280
Hello!

8
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:11,500
Dero was sleeping!

9
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,400
Dero was sleeping.

10
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,360
That's you.

11
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:16,280
No!

12
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,000
I was sleeping.

13
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,320
I was just...

14
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,080
Yeah?

15
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:22,760
What were you?

16
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,700
You were just late?

17
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,620
Well, why were you late?

18
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,120
Yeah.

19
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,060
Why were you late?

20
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,460
I took a nap.

21
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,340
Just a nap.

22
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:32,960
Must leave.

23
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,900
She missed her alarm, guys.

24
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,600
She missed her alarm.

25
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,700
She slept through her alarm.

26
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,520
But I came here, okay?

27
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,460
We're all here!

28
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:45,560
I did wake up.

29
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,280
We're all here now.

30
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,600
Hey, why don't we all introduce ourselves?

31
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,040
Who wants to start?

32
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,540
Does anyone want to start?

33
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:56,840
I'll start?

34
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,580
Okay, hello!

35
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,460
I am Doki Bird.

36
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,420
Hello.

37
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,160
Okay, I'm done.

38
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:05,900
Thank you.

39
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:06,580
Thank you.

40
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:14,080
I accidentally sent my tomato picture to Hiro and Nachan.

41
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,480
And they were like, is this Doki?

42
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,680
And I was like, yeah.

43
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:20,720
Tomato!

44
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,760
Alright, who wants to go next?

45
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,280
I'm stupid tomato.

46
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,940
Who wants to go next?

47
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,280
Okay.

48
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,060
I can go next.

49
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:32,420
Okay.

50
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,960
Hi, I'm Hiro.

51
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,240

53
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:37,400
That's it?

54
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,140
Nice to meet you.

55
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,800
Nice to meet you.

56
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:43,440
Yeah, of course.

00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,080
Thank you.

58
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:45,740
Alright.

59
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,460
Who's next?

60
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:46,700
Yeah, I'm excited.

61
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,900
I'm gonna capture ghosts.

62
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:48,620
Oh, wait, wait.

63
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:48,800
No.

64
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,820
Nachan should be last.

65
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,520
I won't ask Nachan a question after.

66
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,740
Ditto, you go next.

67
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,460
Okay.

68
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,100
Hi, I'm Ditto from Linkage 8.

00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:02,500
Yeah.

00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,300
Okay.

76
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,520
Nachan.

77
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,680
Okay.

78
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:10,620
And...

79
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,420
She brought out the paper.

80
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,240
Hello everyone.

81
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,900
My name is Nachan.

82
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,680
I'm going to speak English.

83
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,100
I'm going to speak English fluently.

84
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,400
But I will try my best and let's have fun today.

85
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,140
Yay!

86
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:33,820
Nachan.

87
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,140
Nachan.

88
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,320
Can you...

89
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,720
What English words do you know, Nachan?

90
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,160
What English words?

91
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,120
Can you show us all your English?

92
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,640
Native English.

93
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,760
Yeah, native English.

94
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,160
Okay, okay.

95
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,640
Um...

96
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,220
What the what?

97
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,300
Nachan, did Hiro teach you this?

98
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,880
Hiro teach you, right?

99
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,260
No, no.

100
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:04,740
Right?

101
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,880
Right, Nachan?

102
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,480
Where did Nachan go?

103
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,760
Nachan, who teach Hiro?

104
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,880
Did Hiro teach?

105
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,360
YouTube.

106
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,540
Oh, YouTube.

107
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:14,400

108
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:14,760
YouTube.

109
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,820
Nachan, Nachan.

110
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,100
What did...

111
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,060
What did I teach you?

112
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,800
Teach me, teach me.

113
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,420
I taught you a word.

114
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,560
What did I teach you?

115
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,660
What the hell?

116
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,620
What the hell?

117
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,540
What the hell?

118
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,200
What the hell?

119
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:42,560
What the hell?

120
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,120
What the hell?

121
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,460
What does that mean, Nachan?

122
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,640
Amazing.

123
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,340
Yeah!

124
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,100
Amazing.

00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,600
Amazing.

126
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,080
Amazing.

127
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,060
What the hell?

128
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,180
What the hell?

129
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,340
What did you teach her?

130
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,000
I taught her good English.

131
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,080
What do you mean?

132
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,580
Good English.

133
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,420
This is international collab.

134
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,200
We have Chinese, English, Japanese.

135
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,040
Okay.

136
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,240
We are going to learn new words today.

137
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,080
We are going to be good teachers.

138
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,560
Okay, how do we play?

139
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,780
I never played before.

140
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,040
I have never played only once.

141
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,440
I never played.

142
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,900
You guys are professionals.

143
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,900
You guys never played?

144
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,420
No, they played.

145
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,780
We played a little bit, Nachan and I.

146
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,320
Little bit.

147
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,720
Teach me.

148
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,380
Teach us.

149
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,080
Anything for the views.

150
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,080
Yeah, anything.

151
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,840
We are going to go viral.

152
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,820
Go viral.

153
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,200
Okay.

154
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,480
Go down to old world, film something scary.

155
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,640
Who is going to die first?

156
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,680
Someone has to die for views.

157
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,560
Me?

158
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,360
Why me?

159
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,580
It should be you.

160
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,060
You are late.

161
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,280
You were late.

162
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,820
You should die first.

163
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,520
Who is going to get the camera?

164
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:10,700
Light.

165
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:10,840
Light.

166
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,360
Camera.

167
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:13,880
Okay.

168
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,400
Wait, there is battery.

169
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,540
How do you charge battery?

170
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,320
Here.

171
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,860
You can charge battery here.

172
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,520
Oh, here.

173
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,540
How do I do that?

174
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:23,740
Stand here.

175
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,100
Oh, I charged it.

00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,480
Let's go.

177
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,100
Let's be streamers.

178
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,200
We are going to be famous guys.

179
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,000
Wait, there is something here.

180
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,300
There is a green screen here.

181
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,000
Oh, really?

182
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:41,800
Oh.

183
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,360
Oh, right.

184
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,920
You can change the light.

185
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,200
Oh, right.

186
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,100
What's the emote?

187
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,520
I know there is emotes too.

00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,020
T.

190
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:53,380
Okay.

191
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,680
Oh, I don't have emote.

192
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,480
I don't have money.

193
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:57,880
Hello, everybody.

194
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,820
Wait, film me.

00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:03,840
Okay.

202
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:04,780
Okay.

203
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,720
I will give you a sign.

204
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,060
Okay.

205
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:10,980
Okay.

206
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,520
One.

207
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,080
One.

208
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:14,700
Two.

209
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:15,400
Three.

210
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:15,700
Go.

211
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,460
Hello, everybody.

212
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:18,700
Today, Ditto.

213
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,620
Hello, everybody.

214
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,840
Today, Ditto is going to die.

215
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,660
Okay, I'm done.

216
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,180
Okay.

217
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,220
What the...

218
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,360
I need to...

219
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:32,920
Okay, let's go.

220
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:33,660
Okay, let's go.

221
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:34,080
Let's go.

222
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:34,980
I stopped.

223
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,560
My game was crazy.

224
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,840
I died.

225
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,300
I'm done.

226
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,700
How do we go?

227
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,160
I need post-it.

228
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,260
Submerge.

229
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,520
Is this it?

230
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,480
Submerge?

231
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,220
Door?

232
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:51,680
Okay.

233
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:53,560
Okay.

234
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,180
Here we go.

235
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,320
Okay, let's go.

236
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,440
Oh my god.

237
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,200
What the fuck?

238
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,800
What the fuck is this?

239
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,140
What the fuck?

240
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,280
What the...

241
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,100
What the fuck is this?

242
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:11,300
What the fuck is this?

243
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:11,980
Yeah.

244
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,380
Alright.

245
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,720
You can see your stamina on the...

246
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,220
You can see your stamina on the...

247
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:20,780
Oh, I see.

248
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,340
Yay, I see.

249
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,760
Okay.

250
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,640
I'm ready.

251
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,060
So, we need to just make content, right?

252
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,640
Yes.

253
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,900
Yes, yes, okay.

254
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,280
Someone dies...

255
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,980
You get lots of views, right?

256
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,020
When someone dies?

257
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,080
Yeah, we're gonna go into this house!

258
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:41,860
Let's go!

259
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,890
I'm dead.

260
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,490
No, we're not dead!

261
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,230
We're alive!

262
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,470
This is so...

263
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,470
Holy shit, this echo.

264
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,030
Oh my god.

265
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,590
That's so volume.

266
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,230
Okay.

267
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,550
Don't worry, we're okay.

268
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,590
That's so scary.

269
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:15,930
It's not scary.

270
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,130
Yeah, it's not scary.

271
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,230
Look at this, it's just a house.

272
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:25,970
Okay.

273
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,750
Yeah, it's a factory.

274
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:38,870
Okay, okay.

275
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,350
Don't worry, I won't get lost.

276
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,410
Follow me, follow me, follow me!

277
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,550
I know how to make content!

278
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,090
Follow you, follow you!

279
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,690
Yeah, follow me, follow me!

280
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,730
I'm content master.

281
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,250
Follow me, follow me!

282
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,150
Hello?

283
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:57,630
Monster?

284
00:08:59,010 --> 00:08:59,490
Monster?

285
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,550
Okay, no, no, this way, this way.

286
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:02,730
No, no, no, no, no, no.

287
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,230
Oh my god!

288
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:05,290
What?

289
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,530
Are you okay?

290
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,830
Wait, wait, wait!

291
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,430
She's...

292
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:13,750
Wait!

293
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,470
What the heck is this?

294
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:17,890
What's this?

295
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,710
You killed her!

296
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:23,270
Wait, this is the game!

297
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,170
Hello.

298
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,510
Hey guys.

299
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,970
Oh, hey, hey.

304
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:33,390
Ah!

305
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,070
That's not my best friend!

306
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,270
That's my best friend!

307
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:39,090

310
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,090
Wait, wait, Hiro!

311
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:43,930
Where are you, Hiro?

312
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:46,810
Okay, I'm recording.

313
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,590
Ah!

314
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:48,290
No, no, no!

315
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:48,930
Okay, okay, okay.

316
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:49,930
Hello everybody.

317
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,430
Welcome to my channel.

318
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,130
This is my best friend, Gary.

319
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,350
And like today, he and I...

320
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,410
He's gonna give us a tour of the factory.

321
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,310
Okay, we follow...

322
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:03,530
Okay.

323
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,050
Oh my god.

324
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:05,890
Look, he's...

325
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:06,690
Alright,

326
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:12,650
I'm okay.

327
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,110
I'm okay.

328
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:14,870
Yeah.

329
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,190
I'm okay.

330
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,290
Go back, go back.

331
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,310
Alright, alright.

332
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,990
No, no, we gotta make more content!

333
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,070
We go see.

334
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,310
Follow me, follow me!

335
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:27,050
Oh!

336
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:28,370
Downstairs?

337
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,150
No, no, no.

338
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,110
He just loves hugging.

339
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:33,850
Oh, there's the exit.

340
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,350
There's the exit.

341
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:37,150
Oh!

342
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:38,430
Oh!

343
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:40,170
What?

344
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,650
Wait, is he...

345
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:45,870
Is he nice?

346
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,230
What the hell?

347
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,290
Is he nice?

348
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,530
Oh my god.

349
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,750
Okay, wait, I need to turn down my game volume.

350
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:59,310
Okay, okay, I turned it down.

351
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,110
Wait, is he nice?

352
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:01,550
What's up?

353
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,650
Get home.

354
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:03,710
Where did he go?

355
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,770
I have 0% battery.

356
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:09,690
He's right there!

357
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:10,210
Oh, wait, wait.

358
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:10,990
Did you film him?

359
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,470
Film him, film him!

360
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:13,550
Hello guys.

361
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:14,210
Welcome.

362
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,670
Oh my god.

363
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,690
Holy shit.

364
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,370
I can't...

365
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:20,150
I can't see him.

366
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,350
You can't see him?

367
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:23,250
You don't see him?

368
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,270
Yeah, I don't see him.

369
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:25,990
He don't...

370
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,450
He don't see him?

371
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,630
He's right in front of you!

372
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,190
Ditto!

373
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,130
I don't see!

374
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:34,890
I don't see!

375
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:35,710
Come here!

376
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:38,520
Give me the camera!

377
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,280
Give me the camera!

378
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,240
I can see him.

379
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,780
No, it's a person.

380
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,480
Oh, is it full?

381
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:46,900
Oh no!

383
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,260
What is that?

384
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,260
I don't see!

385
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,360
It's just a little boy.

386
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,500
It's a little boy and he's like...

387
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:56,580
He's gone.

388
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,320
He doesn't like you.

389
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,360
He doesn't like you.

390
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,580
Alright, our first...

391
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,360

Okay, I'm done.

425
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,200
Lots of views, right?

426
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,280
When someone dies.

427
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,260
Yeah!

428
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,040

Honestly, I really like Hiro-chan's voice!

476
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,460

Okay.

586
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:50,170
He's... he's very weak.

587
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:50,890
Yes.

588
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,790
Oh, what the f...

589
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:55,350
What the f... He's really weak?

590
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:55,690
Okay.

591
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,970
Wasn't there another...

592
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,810
Let's find the little boy.

593
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:04,890
Damage.

594
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:05,750
Oh, okay.

595
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:06,370
That's good.

596
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,030
Alright, don't worry, guys.

597
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,090
Follow me, follow me.

598
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:10,470
Okay, okay.

599
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:11,230
Follow me.

600
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:12,590
I can clap.

601
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:14,190
I can clap.

602
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:16,230
I can clap.

603
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:16,310
I can clap.

604
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,050
I can clap.

605
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,390
I can clap.

606
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:21,970
I can clap.

607
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:27,330
I can clap.

608
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:31,850
Okay, we find the little boy.

609
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:33,210
Thank you.

610
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,090
Don't worry.

611
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:36,750
There's no fall damage.

612
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:36,870
Don't worry.

613
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:36,890
There's no fall damage.

614
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:41,130
There's no fall damage.

615
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,030
Look at that.

616
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:42,450
We're fine.

617
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,030
We're okay.

618
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,330
No fall damage.

619
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:49,110
No fall damage.

620
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:49,990
No fall damage.

621
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:50,790
We'll be fine.

622
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,690
Oh, what's this?

623
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:54,930
Wait.

624
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:55,350
Wait.

625
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,710
Huh?

626
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:58,950
What is that?

627
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:00,990
What is that?

628
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,630
Oh, it's a head.

629
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:05,390
You gave me head.

630
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:05,670
Okay.

631
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:06,070
Which one?

632
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:06,450
Which one?

633
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:07,590
Ah.

634
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:12,690
Don't worry.

635
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:13,210
Oh, wait.

636
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:13,690
That's scary.

637
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:14,730
Film something scary.

638
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:15,810
That's scary.

639
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:18,370
Wait.

640
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:18,790
What's that?

641
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:20,610
What's that over there?

642
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:21,390
Whoa!

643
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:22,490
Whoa!

644
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,030
What's that?

645
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,370
Don't touch.

646
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,110
Don't touch.

647
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:27,470
Okay?

648
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:28,090
Okay.

649
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:31,250
Instantly?

650
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,390
Something there.

651
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:32,910
Which one?

652
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,370
There's something there.

653
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:35,130
Do you see it?

654
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:35,890
Yeah.

655
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:38,210
Wait.

656
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,560
Where's...

657
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,700
I clapped and I died.

658
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,080
Wait.

659
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,860
I clapped and I died.

660
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,080
He's dead.

661
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,720
He's dead.

662
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,380
He's

663
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:15,160
dead.

664
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,320
He's into the laser.

665
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,220
I can't believe it.

666
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,460
I clapped to death.

667
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:24,820
Wait.

668
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:24,900
He's gone.

669
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,520
I hope you guys are okay.

670
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:29,260
I hope the wall... You guys are dying from the wall.

671
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:29,540
Hey.

672
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,320
Sound guy.

673
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,080
Are you okay?

674
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,080
Sound guy.

675
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,920
Sound guy.

676
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,590
I can't believe no one recorded it.

677
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,210
He's crying.

678
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,130
This way.

679
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:50,490
This way.

680
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,310
This way.

681
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:54,650
Okay.

682
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:55,790
Let me turn it down.

683
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:56,750
I can turn it down.

684
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:57,130
Okay.

685
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:57,630
Oh my gosh.

686
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:58,970
There you go.

687
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,080
I can't believe it.

688
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:09,120
I can't believe I could laugh to die.

689
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,460
That was so bullshit!

690
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,180
Ambient... okay.

691
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,000
There should be a way to turn down the fucking echo.

692
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,960
How the fuck do you turn down the echo?

693
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,360
Oh my god, what's over there?

694
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:25,780
What's over there?

695
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,240
Oh, that's the guy that slapped me!

696
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:27,700
Oh no!

697
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,100
That's the guy that fucking slapped me!

698
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,140
Oh my god!

699
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,760
He's got a knife!

700
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,860
Oh my god.

701
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,340
Okay, maybe I'll turn...

702
00:22:55,340 --> 00:23:00,200
Okay, I'm gonna turn down here.

703
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,280
Is it sound effects?

704
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,060
Is anyone recording?

705
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,460
Nico!

706
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,680
Wait, did everyone dead?

707
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,560
Oh no!

708
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,420
Oh, that's how...

709
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:15,680
What is that?

710
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,320
Wait, Nacha's dead!

711
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,360
Oh, the echo did not change.

712
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,320
Poor sound guy.

713
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,780
Poor sound guy.

714
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,560
There's no way to fix the echo.

715
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,360
What the fuck?

716
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,330
What the fuck is that?

717
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,690
That's Ness!

718
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,240
It was just like, where do I go?

719
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,500
Oh my

720
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,690
god, they're alive!

721
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,880
Oh my god!

722
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,040
Where is Na-chan?

723
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,600
What the?

724
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,820
Where is Doki?

725
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,900
What happened to... where is Doki?

726
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,580
Yeah, my voice.

727
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,180
Why were they like, where is Na-chan?

728
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,400
What about me?

729
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,160
What about me?

730
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,800
What the fuck?

731
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,800
Why were you guys like, oh my god.

732
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,860
Why were you guys like, where is Na-chan?

733
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,100
What happened to, where is Doki?

734
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,760
You guys didn't care about Doki.

735
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,600
Yeah, yeah, no one ever asked where Doki is.

736
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,640
Okay, I'm ready.

737
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,980
This is $100.

738
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,180
This is $100 of caffeine.

739
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,640
I wonder if Doki is having fun.

740
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,960
What is that?

741
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,740
I gave you head.

742
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,380
Oh, it's a head.

743
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:30,320
Oh, but there's something there.

744
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,080
Oh my god.

745
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:32,900
Which one?

746
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,080
There's something there.

747
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:35,860
Yeah.

748
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,120
Wait, what?

749
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:51,430
There's Doki.

750
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,650
What is that?

751
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:55,450
What is that?

752
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:58,010
She's there.

753
00:26:58,370 --> 00:26:59,670
Okay, okay.

754
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,330
Okay, okay.

755
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,670
Wait, what?

756
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,530
Why is she leaving?

757
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,350
What is that?

758
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:08,350
Oh, what is that?

759
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:27,170
You're crying.

760
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:28,290
Why are you just dancing?

761
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,270
You're crying.

762
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,530
Oh my god.

763
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:32,510
Oh my god.

764
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:34,250
Oh my god.

765
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:36,270
We did it.

766
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:37,170
We made $200.

767
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:39,570
Thank you both, guys.

768
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,030
Wait, we've done so much.

769
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:43,070
Yeah, yeah, we can buy more stuff now.

770
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,170
Let's go.

771
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,230
It's so much fun now.

772
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:47,250
Yeah, yeah, shop time.

773
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:47,950
Shopping, shopping.

774
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:51,010
It's shopping time!

775
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:51,570
Go back!

776
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:54,030
It's shopping time!

777
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:56,890
Oh wait!

Natchan, I believe in you, Natchan!

854
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,190
I believe in you, Natchan!

855
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:37,290
You can see the battery.

856
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,890
You can see the camera's battery.

857
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:44,190
If it runs out of battery, we can't see anything.

858
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:44,770
If it runs out of battery, we can't see anything.

859
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:44,790
If it runs out of battery, we can't see anything.

860
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:44,810
Okay.

861
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:45,170
Okay.

862
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,710
I'm pushing, I'm pushing him!

863
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:59,310
I'm pushing him away!

864
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,710
Okay, I hugged him!

865
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:05,490

867
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,780
Did you hug him?

868
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,740
Did you hug?

869
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,840
I can't hug you.

870
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,880
Did you hug him?

871
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,820
Leave me alone!

872
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:40,430
Leave, leave, leave, leave!

873
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:40,730

874
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:42,090

875
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:46,430
Okay, don't worry.

876
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,190
We'll be fine, we're fine.

877
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,490
We gave him a hug.

878
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,510
It's okay.

879
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:54,270
We gave him a hug now.

880
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:57,010
Is your HP okay?

881
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

882
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:01,210
It was not a tight hug.

883
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:03,650
Can someone heal me?

884
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:04,570
Can someone heal me?

885
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:05,770
Wait, how do you heal?

886
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:09,210
How do we heal?

887
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:09,530
Oh.

888
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:11,190
Okay, I'm gonna...

889
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:14,690
How does this feel?

890
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:15,990
How does...

891
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,610
How does this feel?

892
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:21,330
Is this...

893
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:22,770
Yeah, it's like a scare.

894
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:26,130
Do you need a hug, Nachan?

895
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,450
Okay, I'm okay now.

896
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:28,630
Do you need a hug?

897
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:29,650
Here's a hug.

898
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:31,970
Hello, Nachan.

899
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,550

903
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,780
Someone hug me!

904
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,000
Someone hug me!

905
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,200

915
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:21,790
The gun?

916
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:24,730
Oh yeah, we can film the gun.

917
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:26,570
Wait, but this... What's this?

918
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:27,990

If I just...

967
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:23,280
Maybe if I just hide in this corner?

968
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,880
That everything will be okay?

969
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:27,540

972
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,440
It's okay.

973
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,320
I have my... I have my...

974
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,680
Guys, it's okay.

975
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,820
They'll come back for me, right?

976
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,420
They're...

977
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,700
They're gonna come back for me, right, guys?

978
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:45,820
Hello?

979
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,020
Hello?

980
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:48,240
Hello?

981
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,200
Surely they'll come back for me.

982
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,140
Surely they'll come back for me.

983
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,520
Surely I'm important enough for them to rescue me.

984
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,000
Right?

985
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,080
No, no, no.

986
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:02,740
This isn't...

987
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,440
I left four deads in there.

988
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,720
Oh, my God.

989
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,240
Oh, my God.

990
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,100
I'm so fucked.

991
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,260
Oh, my God, I'm so fucked.

992
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:12,960
Guys!

993
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,440
I'm so fucked.

994
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,060
I'm so fucked.

995
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,220
I'm gonna do a merry-go-round.

996
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,120
Oh, my God, they don't know.

997
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,540
They don't know to aggro to somebody else.

998
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,360
They know, they know, they know.

999
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,960
This is a hell, Mary.

1000
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,580
This is a hell, Mary.

1001
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,760
There's no way I die to this laser.

1002
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,760
There's no way.

1003
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,380
You know what?

1004
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,140
Down is up.

1005
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,240
Down is up.

1006
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,480
I fucking...

1007
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,960
I fucking knew it.

1008
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,500
I fucking knew it.

1009
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,420
Down is up!

1010
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,760
Down is always up!

1011
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,640
Down is always up!

1012
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,140
No way!

1013
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,240
No way!

1014
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,420
Down is up!

1015
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,720
We're gonna make it!

1016
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,960
We're gonna make it!

1017
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:13,780
Wait.

1018
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,900
How do I...

1019
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,400
How do I close this?

1020
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,120
How do I close the door?

1021
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,620
How do I close the door?

1022
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:22,880
Oh, no.

1023
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,720
So, how do I...

1024
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,300
How do I close the door?

1025
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,260
How do I close the door?

1026
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,460
Why...

1027
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,620
Why isn't...

1028
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:34,100
Why isn't the door closed?

1029
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,080
I broke it!

1030
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:37,340
Oh, no.

1031
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,120
Oh, no.

1032
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,100
Oh, no.

1033
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,520
Oh.

1034
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,860
Where are my comrades?

1035
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,620
The others... Are they still alive?

1036
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,020
Are they still alive?

1037
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:52,540
I don't believe...

1038
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,120
It won't be funny.

1039
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,680
Ditto?

1040
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,000
Hitto?

1041
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,120
Not yet?

1042
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:07,400
It will be pretty funny.

1043
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,840
But what if I die?

1044
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,260
I need the camera.

1045
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:14,700
I need the camera.

1046
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,060
You'll lose if I do.

1047
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,100
Oh, no.

1048
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,520
But where are... Are they still alive?

1049
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,000
But where are...

1050
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Are they still alive?

1051
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,300
164...

1052
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:25,720
100...

1053
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,280
They're still like...

1054
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,780
Oh, they're still fucking dead.

1055
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,400
We do not have the oxygen for this, guys.

1056
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:39,560
We do not have the oxygen.

1057
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,840
Oh, they're out of ox...

1058
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,520
Wait, how do...

1059
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,720
How do I have more ox...

1060
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,860
Oh, is it because I went up?

1061
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,220
Oh yeah, they're fucking dead dead.

1062
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,180
They're not even moving.

1063
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,680
They're not even moving.

1064
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,140
He saw me, he saw me.

1065
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:58,960
He saw me.

1066
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,660
Noooo!

1067
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:04,800
No!

1068
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,620
I didn't do it!

1069
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,320
I didn't do it!

1070
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,680
It wasn't closed!

1071
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,320
I tried to close...

1072
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,060
Wait until you close the door.

1073
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,320
Wait until you close the door.

1074
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:41,300
I tried to close and it wasn't close.

1075
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:47,520
It was just a bad dream, everybody.

1076
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,500
Just a really bad dream.

1077
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,660
It's okay, it's okay.

1078
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,100
We still have our channel.

1079
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,560
We're gonna be big YouTube stars.

1080
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,560
We're gonna be big streamers.

1081
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:05,740
We're gonna be big Twitch streamers, big YouTube, big Billy Billy streamers.

1082
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:06,560
We're gonna be famous.

1083
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,580
Yeah, really.

1084
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:13,120
We are Spooktober, okay?

1085
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,460
We're gonna be big.

1086
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:16,840
Spooktober.

1087
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,940
We're gonna be big Spooktober.

1088
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,100
We're going viral.

1089
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:20,820
World tour.

1090
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,260
World tour international.

1091
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,100
We are content gods.

1092
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,480
It's okay, we can do it again.

1093
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:30,900
Let's go.

1094
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,580
Wait, do we have the hug?

1095
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,360
No, we don't.

1096
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,380
We have no hug?

1097
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,100
It's okay, guys.

1098
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,120
Do you know what we do have?

1099
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,460
Can you...emotes?

1100
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,900
Okay, are you filming?

1101
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:51,460
They may have taken our hug, but I'll still clap.

1102
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,080
I'll still clap.

1103
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,660
The most emo...

1104
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,540
Emo is forever.

1105
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,420
Emo is forever.

1106
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,080
Let me explain the game.

1107
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:07,620
Okay.

1108
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,240
Yeah.

1109
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,900
Okay, this game.

1110
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,740
The camera is very important.

1111
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:17,400
Yeah.

1112
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,200
More than our life.

1113
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,840
We have to save more than our life.

1114
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:21,580
Yeah.

1115
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,220
Okay, that's not my fault.

1116
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,340
You guys died.

1117
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,260
I lived.

1118
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:26,000
No.

1119
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:26,880
No.

1120
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:27,620
June.

1121
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:28,620
June.

1122
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:29,560
She ran away.

1123
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,160
I ran away?

1124
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,520
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1125
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,540
No, no.

1126
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:34,920
You.

1127
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:35,580
You.

1128
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:36,400
You left me.

1129
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,760
You left me.

1130
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,440
I did not run away.

1131
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:42,920
You guys left me to die.

1132
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:44,020
No.

1133
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:44,440
No.

1134
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,360
Left for dead.

1135
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,740
And now it's our next day.

1136
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:48,980
Okay.

1137
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,640
Let's get her back.

1138
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,020
Hey, Gary.

1139
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,600
Yeah.

1140
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,820
He shouldn't be outside.

1141
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,340
Why he's outside?

1142
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,320
Because he wants...

1143
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,340
Because he wants to welcome us.

1144
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,060
He's our best friend.

1145
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:06,620
Oh, I'm so nice.

1146
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,140
Our best friend.

1147
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,480
All right.

1148
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:11,720
Yeah.

1149
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,040
If we are...

1150
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,740
If we launch the monster, it's gonna run away again.

1151
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,720
That's not true.

1152
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:19,000
You all ran away from me.

1153
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:22,380
You guys ran away from me.

1154
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,320
Hiro.

1155
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,280
Hiro, Nata, and me.

1156
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,460
We have to get out of here.

1157
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:27,840
Yeah.

1158
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:30,920
And all three of you ran away from me.

1159
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,420
You guys are...

1160
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,080
You guys are...

1161
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:34,920
No, no, no, no, no.

1162
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,740
I don't run away.

1163
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:37,040
I don't run away.

1164
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:37,900
I'm not a cat.

1165
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:38,680
What...

1166
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,640
What is that?

1167
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:40,480
What is that?

1168
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,360
Film.

1169
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:42,720
Film it.

1170
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,160
Film it.

1171
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:43,520
Film it.

1172
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,630
Go on.

1173
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:46,810
Go on.

1174
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:48,590
Go on.

1175
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:49,010
Go on.

1176
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:52,170
What's going

1177
00:42:58,050 --> 00:42:58,490
to...

1178
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:01,350
He's not...

1179
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:02,210
He's not this kind.

1180
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:02,970
Okay.

1181
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:03,470
Come here.

1182
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:03,770
Come here.

1183
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:04,390
Follow me.

1184
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:04,870
Follow me.

1185
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:05,650
See.

1186
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:06,830
I didn't run away.

1187
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:09,010
I didn't run away, guys.

1188
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:09,010
Okay, guys.

1189
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:13,270
Follow me, follow me.

1190
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:17,130
Okay, nothing.

1191
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:20,370
Okay, okay.

1192
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:21,510
Back here, back here.

1193
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:24,650
Don't... Follow me, follow me, follow me.

1194
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:28,290
Oh, it's here.

1195
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:31,130
Oh, it's him again.

1196
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:31,750
He's back.

1197
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:35,570
Look, there he is.

1198
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:41,030
Where is it?

1199
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:58,330
Hey, Hiro's dead.

1200
00:43:58,530 --> 00:43:59,570
Hiro's dead.

1201
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:01,210
Hiro's dead.

1202
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:02,390
Hiro...

1203
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:03,910
Hiro died.

1204
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:04,790
Hiro?

1205
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:05,890
Yeah, yeah.

1206
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:07,330
No, she's dead.

1207
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:08,330
She's dead.

1208
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:12,390
I watched her die.

1209
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:14,590
Oh, oh, she... Nachan, Nachan.

1210
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:20,120
Oh, look at what Nachan got.

1211
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:20,920
Nachan.

1212
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,280
Okay, okay.

1213
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,020
Yeah.

1214
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:28,180
Follow me, follow me.

1215
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,660
Oh, I got one too.

1216
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,200
Look, look, look.

1217
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:34,160
Whoa.

1218
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:38,640
Oh, so cool.

1219
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:42,360
Cool.

1220
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:44,100
Down is up.

1221
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:44,780
Down is up.

1222
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,180
We're back here.

1223
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:46,820
We're back in the beginning.

1224
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:49,300
Okay.

1225
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:50,240
We were here, right?

1226
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:50,940
Yeah, we were here.

1227
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,340
Okay, I'm going up.

1228
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,300
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1229
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:02,940
He missed, he missed, he missed, he missed, he missed.

1230
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:03,800
Oh, my God.

1231
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:03,800
Okay, I'm going.

1232
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:03,980
Yeah, yeah.

1233
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:04,140
Go.

1234
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,060
Go, go, go, go, go.

1235
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,540
We leave Nachsan, we leave Nachsan.

1236
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,160
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

1237
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:07,800
It's okay, it's okay.

1238
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,360
If Nachan dies, it's okay.

1239
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,360
It's okay.

1240
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:13,620
No, no, no.

1241
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,560
She's dead, she's dead.

1242
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:15,580
No, no, no.

1243
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:16,620
She's dead, she's dead.

1244
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:17,320
She's dead.

1245
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:19,500
She's dead.

1246
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,160
No, no, no.

1247
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:20,980
She's dead.

1248
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,320
She's so dead.

1249
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:27,400
Nachan!

1250
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,160
I knew you were...

1251
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,940
You didn't die, Nachan.

1252
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:40,340
Natchan, congrats!

1253
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,240
I'm so happy you're alive!

1254
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:45,580
She keeps telling me fake news.

1255
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,320
No, it's real!

1256
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:48,300
What do you mean?

1257
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:49,040
No!

1258
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:50,020
It was real.

1259
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,840
She's still alive!

1260
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,640
No, no, no, she came back!

1261
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,720
It's like Jesus.

1262
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:57,940
She came back.

1263
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:58,880
I see.

1264
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:01,360
Yeah, Natchan's like Jesus.

1265
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,280
Natchan, are you God?

1266
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:07,560
No die!

1267
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:08,480
Yeah, see?

1268
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:09,060
No die!

1269
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,020
No die!

1270
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,540
Okay, no die.

1271
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:13,420
Yeah, look at that.

1272
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:15,460
Right here, right here.

1273
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:16,460
Alright.

1274
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:17,680
Oh, she's dead.

1275
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:18,480
No, she's dead.

1276
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,220
I watched her die.

1277
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,100
Yay!

1278
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:25,940
Goodbye, Hiro.

1279
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:26,960
Goodbye.

1280
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:38,000
Let's welcome back Hiro.

1281
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:42,310
Hiro!

1282
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:43,990
Welcome back!

1283
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:46,090
I'm a ghost!

1284
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:48,890
Hiro, I saw that.

1285
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:51,570
I saw you run into the laser.

1286
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:54,150
I was like, ooh, laser.

1287
00:46:55,090 --> 00:46:56,290
Ooh, laser.

1288
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:58,250
My name is Owen Fraser and I...

1289
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:01,390
How is our stream?

1290
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:03,750
We're gonna be famous, guys.

1291
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:04,750
We're gonna be famous.

1292
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:06,330
Are you the lady?

1293
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:07,170
Yeah, I'm ready.

1294
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:08,270
Okay.

1295
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:08,750
That's nice.

1296
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:09,430
Okay, okay.

1297
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:09,870
Hold on.

1298
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:10,410
You ready?

1299
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:13,770
Yeah.

1300
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:14,850
Why is he all night?

1301
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:15,790
Because he wants us.

1302
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:17,470
And he wants to welcome us.

1303
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:20,250
Hiro, Natchan, and me.

1304
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:20,730
We are...

1305
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:21,590
We are...

1306
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:22,330
Hiro-chan.

1307
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:26,730
We're going, we're going, we're going.

1308
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:27,310
We're going!

1309
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:29,870
I'm a ghost!

1310
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:46,670
Oh, I'm a ghost!

1311
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:47,210
I'm a ghost!

1312
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:47,830
I'm a ghost!

1313
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:47,910
I'm a ghost!

1314
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:48,130
I'm a ghost!

1315
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:48,150
I'm a ghost!

1316
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:48,210
No,

1317
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:52,260
no, no!

1318
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,440
I'm a ghost!

1319
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,380
I'm so scared!

1320
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:02,000
I'm so scared!

1321
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:02,640
Hiro's dead.

1322
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:03,880
Hiro's dead.

1323
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:07,040
He's gonna die.

1324
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:07,420
Oh!

1325
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:08,360
Nachan!

1326
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:09,440
Yeah!

1327
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,220
Look at

1328
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:20,390
him!

1329
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:28,230
We need

1330
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:33,260
Nachan!

1331
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:34,220
It's okay!

1332
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:34,600
It's okay!

1333
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,120
If Nachan dies, it's okay!

1334
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:43,360
It's okay!

1335
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,180
It was okay!

1336
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:46,180
It was okay!

1337
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:47,340
Look!

1338
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:48,120
Look!

1341
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:53,560
one dot nine K.

1342
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,720
We're almost at three hundred dollars!

1343
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:57,760
Yeah, we almost did it.

1344
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:02,160
Yay!

1345
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:05,580
Good morning!

1346
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,640
Good morning!

1347
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,800
Good morning, guys!

1348
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:10,200
Okay.

1349
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:11,100
Good morning!

1350
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:12,640
Another day of making...

1351
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:13,440
content!

1352
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:16,020
Soaping, soaping!

1353
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:17,600
Let's collect it down.

1354
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:18,900
Yeah, we need a hugger.

1355
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:19,740
We need a hugger.

1356
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:20,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1357
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:21,800
One hugger.

1358
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,000
And one flashlight.

1359
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,340
All flashlight.

1360
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:25,840
Okay.

1361
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:26,240
Okay.

1362
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:28,300
Wait, do we still have money?

1363
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:29,020
Yeah, we do.

1364
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:31,420
We have like... we have a hundred seventy-two.

1365
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:33,680
Let's play the soundboard.

1366
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,500
Oh yeah, the soundboard.

1367
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:36,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1368
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:38,860
Good, good, good purchase.

1369
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:40,140
Here, here, here.

1370
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:41,060
Okay, flashlight, flashlight.

1371
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,680
What else should we get?

1372
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:44,840
We should have... how much do we have?

1373
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:45,500
Seventy dollars?

1374
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,140
Can we afford anything?

1375
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:48,700
Oh my god!

1376
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:50,360
Yeah?

1377
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,300
What's this?

1378
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,340
I think we're gonna be in the red.

1379
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:00,260
Oh, okay, wait, wait, wait.

1380
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,100
I ordered something that I really want.

1381
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,420
What did you buy?

1382
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:12,180
That's it.

1383
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:13,900
I already used it.

1384
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,500
We should buy another one!

1385
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:18,700
We should buy another one!

1386
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:24,400
I didn't know it was one use!

1387
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:24,840
I didn't know it was one use!

1388
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,420
No one told me it was one use!

1389
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:30,860
No one told me it was one use!

1390
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:31,320
There it is!

1391
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,300
Okay, okay, okay.

1392
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,200
When we...

1393
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:35,960
When we survive...

1394
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,980
Okay, I know when to use this.

1395
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:40,140
When we survive, I'll use this.

1396
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:46,920
Look, I have a soundboard.

1397
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:50,460
What's this?

1398
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:51,660
It's a soundboard!

1399
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:54,540
Oh, you're like... you're like the sound player.

1400
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:55,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1401
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:56,680
I help the sound player.

1402
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,360
Wait, what's this?

1403
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:59,360
It's evil.

1404
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,220
How to...

1405
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:03,380
What is that?

1406
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,080
Help me!

1407
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,560
What is that?

1408
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,520
What is this?

1409
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:09,140
What is this?

1410
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:10,200
What are you doing?

1411
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:11,080
I don't know!

1412
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:13,320
I don't know.

1413
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,120
Are you like, flying?

1414
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,260
You're flying!

1415
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,620
You're flying!

1416
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,240
Alright, let's go!

1417
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,220
Let's film content!

1418
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:24,400
It's content time!

1419
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,360
I have high gear so I can heal you guys.

1420
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,780
Alright, nice.

1421
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:29,880
I love heals.

1422
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:30,200
Okay.

1423
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:31,820
I have...

1424
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,860
I have a...

1425
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:35,660
Big Bang Theory.

1426
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:40,740
Alright, don't worry.

1427
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:45,520
That scared me, actually!

1428
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:46,500
Cool transition.

1429
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,560
Oh my god, I don't like the song.

1430
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,980
Oh, this is gonna make everything sound good!

1431
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,080
Ba-dum-ba-dum!

1432
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,000
Ba-dum-ba-dum!

1433
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,360
Ba-dum-ba-dum!

1434
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:01,040
Yo, be careful!

1435
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,280
Yo, be careful!

1436
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,840
That speed box.

1437
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:10,340
Okay, don't worry.

1438
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,120
When it's funny, I'll play this.

1439
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:14,540
So everyone will know it's funny.

1440
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:16,280
Everyone will know it's funny.

1441
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,480
I feel like that's...

1442
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,740
It's face carry!

1443
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:21,440
Alright,

1444
00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:25,970
here we go.

1445
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:29,230
Alright.

1446
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:29,550
Alright.

1447
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:33,470
I should have incorporated that.

1448
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:35,390
Oh, that's a lot of lasers.

1449
00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:36,550
Wait, wait, wait!

1450
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:37,110
I got it!

1451
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:37,530
I got an idea!

1452
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:38,930
Okay.

1453
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:41,750
Let's go!

1454
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:42,470
Let's go!

1455
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:44,310
You got this!

1456
00:52:47,590 --> 00:52:48,110
Umm...

1457
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:48,490
Oh!

1458
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:51,330
Did you record it?

1459
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:53,110
I did!

1460
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:53,630
I did!

1461
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:54,110
You did?

1462
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:54,930
Okay, nice, nice.

1463
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:55,350
Content!

1464
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:56,170
Okay.

1465
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:57,210
Okay.

1466
00:52:58,310 --> 00:53:00,050
I can do this too.

1467
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:01,350
Okay.

1468
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:02,750
I can do this too.

1469
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:03,010
Can you?

1470
00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:04,890
Nice,

1471
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:09,000
look at us.

1472
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:09,620
We're so good!

1473
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:10,600
We're already so...

1474
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:11,900
Yay!

1475
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:16,460
Alright.

1476
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:19,420
We need to find some monsters for content.

1477
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:21,420
Oh, there's a head here.

1478
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:28,070
I haven't seen any monsters yet.

1479
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:28,510
I haven't seen any monsters yet.

1480
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:30,990
Follow me, follow me.

1481
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:32,450
I'm so good at finding monsters.

1482
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:35,290
Oh, here, here, here!

1483
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:37,890
Crouch down.

1484
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:38,230
Crouch down.

1485
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:42,130
There we go.

1486
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:42,830
There we go.

1487
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:48,440
Oh, there's two!

1488
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:48,900
There's two!

1489
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:49,320
There's two!

1490
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:50,860

1491
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,200

1492
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,180
Are you playing music?

1493
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,100
Where's our cameraman?

1494
00:54:14,270 --> 00:54:14,990
Wait, wait, wait!

1495
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:16,450
Wait, wait, oh, I got an idea!

1496
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:18,470
Okay, okay, film me, film me, film me!

1497
00:54:18,910 --> 00:54:19,450
Film me!

1498
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:21,330
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1499
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:21,850
Film me.

1500
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:22,350
Okay, right here.

1501
00:54:22,410 --> 00:54:22,670
Okay.

1502
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:25,130
Wait, we need to get Gary out of the picture.

1503
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:25,890
Get Gary out.

1504
00:54:26,110 --> 00:54:26,790
Okay, okay, okay.

1505
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:27,590
Okay, okay, okay.

1506
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:28,470
Film me here.

1507
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:29,730
Are you filming?

1508
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:30,470
Got it?

1509
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:31,530
Got it?

1510
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:32,750
Okay.

1511
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:38,800
It was worth it.

1512
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,740
Yeah, you got that?

1513
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:44,120
Okay.

1514
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:47,520
Okay, we got, we got caught.

1515
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,660
Oh my god, he's following me.

1516
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:53,860
Blame the man, I have to blame the man.

1517
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:56,360
Oh, okay, oh, okay, nice.

1518
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:57,840
Nice, nice, nice.

1519
00:54:58,260 --> 00:54:59,540
Oh, we're back in the beginning.

1520
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:05,420
Wait, is there anything else here?

1521
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:05,980
Wait, is there anything else here?

1522
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,780
I think this is a new area.

1523
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:11,980
Teto-chan, HP.

1524
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,420
Yeah, what's your HP?

1525
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:15,140
Do you need hug?

1526
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:16,100
Okay, yeah.

1527
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:17,480
Yeah, we can hug you.

1528
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:19,660
Okay, okay.

1529
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:20,820
Yeah, I can hug you.

1530
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:22,380
Okay.

1531
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:24,220
Wait, film us, film us hugging.

1532
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:26,720
Are you filming us hugging?

1533
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:28,220

1735
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:37,250

1736
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:37,550
What did I say?

1737
01:02:38,290 --> 01:02:39,710
It's like, um...

1738
01:02:39,710 --> 01:02:39,970
.

1739
01:02:41,350 --> 01:02:42,350
What does it do?

1740
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:43,190
.

1741
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:43,390
.

1742
01:02:43,390 --> 01:02:43,970
.

1743
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:44,090
.

1744
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:44,130
.

1745
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:44,170
.

1746
01:02:54,530 --> 01:02:54,970

1747
01:02:54,970 --> 01:02:55,030
.

1748
01:02:55,030 --> 01:02:55,230
.

1749
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:55,910
Oh!

1750
01:02:56,450 --> 01:02:57,670

1752
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:02,030

1755
01:03:03,330 --> 01:03:11,850
Oh my god, it's so slow!

1756
01:03:12,130 --> 01:03:13,650
I guess it slows people down.

1757
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:14,170
.

1758
01:03:14,710 --> 01:03:15,910
Yeah, it's so sticky!

1784
01:04:01,530 --> 01:04:03,710
What did you say?

1785
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:04,050

.

1813
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:13,320
We need to find monsters to interview.

01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:13,720
.

1815
01:05:15,020 --> 01:05:17,020

1817
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:21,100
Oh, God, that's so scary.

1820
01:05:27,710 --> 01:05:28,230

1821
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:28,990
What's over there?

1822
01:05:29,310 --> 01:05:29,510
.

1823
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:32,230
There's lasers here.

1824
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:32,490
.

1825
01:05:32,490 --> 01:05:33,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1826
01:05:34,170 --> 01:05:34,410

1827
01:05:34,410 --> 01:05:34,950
.

1828
01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:35,850
We can't get past that.

1829
01:05:35,950 --> 01:05:37,230
That one we can't get past.

1830
01:05:37,650 --> 01:05:37,670
.

1831
01:05:38,550 --> 01:05:39,510
So maybe here?

1832
01:05:40,550 --> 01:05:40,990
.

1833
01:05:40,990 --> 01:05:42,670
Oh, there's a rib cage.

1834
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:43,050
.

1835
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:44,350
.

1836
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:46,470
Are you filming?

1837
01:05:47,270 --> 01:05:47,470
.

1838
01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:47,570
.

1839
01:05:47,570 --> 01:05:47,890
.

1840
01:05:49,010 --> 01:05:49,450

1842
01:05:59,350 --> 01:05:59,550
.

1843
01:06:02,910 --> 01:06:03,350
.

1844
01:06:03,350 --> 01:06:04,570
This place is like a maze.

1845
01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:05,170
.

1846
01:06:07,370 --> 01:06:09,450
Where are all the monsters?

1847
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:10,310
.

1848
01:06:12,590 --> 01:06:14,710
I found zero monsters.

1849
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:15,530
.

1850
01:06:15,530 --> 01:06:17,990
We need to fucking interview one.

1851
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:18,650
.

1852
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:20,710
.

1853
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:21,010
.

1854
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:21,230

1855
01:06:21,230 --> 01:06:21,410

1856
01:06:33,350 --> 01:06:34,330
Use your content, monster.

1857
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:34,970
.

1858
01:06:39,150 --> 01:06:41,350
All the monsters are scared of us.

1859
01:06:41,510 --> 01:06:42,530
Why are they so scared?

1860
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:43,430
.

1861
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:45,390
Monster.

1862
01:06:46,090 --> 01:06:46,730
.

1863
01:06:49,730 --> 01:06:50,370
Monster.

1864
01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:51,050
.

1865
01:06:51,930 --> 01:06:54,030
Let us use you for content.

1866
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:56,170
We want to be famous YouTubers.

1867
01:06:56,630 --> 01:06:57,270
.

1868
01:06:57,270 --> 01:06:58,350

1870
01:06:58,930 --> 01:07:02,230
And Billy streamers and Twitch streamers.

1871
01:07:02,230 --> 01:07:02,770
.

1872
01:07:02,770 --> 01:07:05,510
Oh my god, there's actually zero monsters.

1873
01:07:06,070 --> 01:07:06,530
.

1874
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:11,850
.

1875
01:07:11,850 --> 01:07:12,790
We have found zero.

1876
01:07:13,810 --> 01:07:14,410
.

1877
01:07:16,090 --> 01:07:16,690
.

1878
01:07:20,510 --> 01:07:23,130
Oh no, we need to find the monsters.

1879
01:07:23,230 --> 01:07:23,430
Okay.

1880
01:07:23,550 --> 01:07:24,910
All right, we got speed run.

1881
01:07:25,090 --> 01:07:27,010
There has to be one person.

1882
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:27,710
.

1883
01:07:28,930 --> 01:07:29,990
Let us use you for views.

1884
01:07:30,610 --> 01:07:31,070
.

1885
01:07:31,070 --> 01:07:33,330
Oh, I found the entrance.

1886
01:07:33,790 --> 01:07:34,210
.

1887
01:07:34,210 --> 01:07:35,890
How is there nobody?

1888
01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:38,070
How do we have no one?

1889
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:38,430
.

1890
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:40,850
There's a laser here.

1891
01:07:41,150 --> 01:07:41,810
.

1892
01:07:42,930 --> 01:07:43,590
.

1893
01:07:43,590 --> 01:07:50,730
What the fuck was that?

1894
01:07:51,010 --> 01:07:51,310
.

1895
01:07:52,370 --> 01:07:53,510
What was that?

1896
01:07:54,290 --> 01:07:54,950
.

1897
01:07:59,390 --> 01:08:00,750
What the fuck was that?

1898
01:08:01,770 --> 01:08:03,910
What the fuck is this?

1899
01:08:04,190 --> 01:08:04,390
.

1900
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:06,450
Yeah, what the fuck is that?

1901
01:08:07,030 --> 01:08:07,590
.

1902
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:08,970
Wait, what?

1903
01:08:09,290 --> 01:08:09,750
.

1904
01:08:12,770 --> 01:08:14,410
I didn't even see it.

1905
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:14,610
.

1906
01:08:14,610 --> 01:08:15,690
I think we need to...

1907
01:08:15,690 --> 01:08:15,810
.

1908
01:08:15,810 --> 01:08:18,070
Yeah, I didn't see anything either.

1909
01:08:18,430 --> 01:08:18,710
.

1910
01:08:18,710 --> 01:08:21,130
It just exploded in front of me.

1911
01:08:21,270 --> 01:08:21,470
.

1912
01:08:22,770 --> 01:08:24,150
How do we get out of here?

1913
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:24,630
.

1914
01:08:25,110 --> 01:08:26,670
Oh my god, I'm lost, guys.

1915
01:08:26,930 --> 01:08:27,210
.

1916
01:08:27,210 --> 01:08:31,970
We're so lost.

1917
01:08:32,270 --> 01:08:32,650
.

1918
01:08:34,190 --> 01:08:35,250
We're so lost.

1919
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:35,750
.

1920
01:08:39,290 --> 01:08:39,770
Wait.

1921
01:08:39,870 --> 01:08:40,350
.

1922
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:42,530
Where's Hiro?

1923
01:08:42,690 --> 01:08:42,970
.

1924
01:08:42,970 --> 01:08:43,210
Hiro?

1925

1933
01:08:49,510 --> 01:08:54,010
What is that?

1934
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:54,310
.

1935
01:08:56,050 --> 01:08:56,850
That's a radio.

1936
01:08:57,130 --> 01:08:57,290
.

1937
01:08:59,170 --> 01:08:59,710
.

1938
01:08:59,710 --> 01:09:00,370

1942
01:09:06,690 --> 01:09:06,790
.

1943
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:21,480

1944
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:22,340

1945
01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:22,360

1951
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:23,180
.

1952
01:09:23,180 --> 01:09:23,200
.

1953
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:23,960
.

1954
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:26,640
.

1955
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:43,660
Film it.

.

1957
01:09:44,860 --> 01:09:45,580

1958
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:45,660
.

1959
01:09:45,660 --> 01:09:46,320
Oh, she's gone.

1960
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:46,820

1961
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:50,160
Goodbye.

I think... .

1964
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:52,560
.

1965
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:56,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:56,540
.

1967
01:09:56,540 --> 01:09:57,440
We have to go back.

1968
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:57,580
.

1969
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:00,440
Nachan, Nachan, she's dead.

1970
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:01,900
Nachan.

1971
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:02,260
.

1972
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:03,580
Come back, Nachan.

1973

1974
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:05,260
Leave her, leave her, leave her.

.

1976
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:07,380
Leave her, leave her, leave her.

1977
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:08,640
.

1978
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:09,880
You have the camera, right?

1979
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:11,020
.

1980
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:11,260
Yeah.

1981
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:11,880
.

1982
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:13,140
Nachan, come, come, come.

1983
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:13,240

1984
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:14,820
We leave.

1985

.

1986
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:15,880
She's dead.

1987
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:16,500
It's okay.

1988
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:16,940
.

1989
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:18,780
She's dead.

1990
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:19,740
We have to leave.

1991
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:20,260
.

1992
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:21,060
Be careful, be careful.

1993
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:21,760
.

1994
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,380
We can go there.

1995
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:23,640
.

1996
01:10:29,430 --> 01:10:29,910
.

1997
01:10:29,910 --> 01:10:31,430
We leave her for content.

1998
01:10:31,630 --> 01:10:31,770
.

1999
01:10:31,770 --> 01:10:32,150
It's okay.

2000
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:32,870
.

2001
01:10:33,410 --> 01:10:35,030
She gave us good content.

2002
01:10:35,230 --> 01:10:35,710
.

2003
01:10:38,310 --> 01:10:38,790
.

2004
01:10:38,790 --> 01:10:41,290
From zero monsters to like... .

2005
01:10:41,290 --> 01:10:41,310
Oh my god, oh my god.

2006
01:10:41,450 --> 01:10:41,610
.

2007
01:10:41,610 --> 01:10:42,950
I hate you.

2008
01:10:43,170 --> 01:10:43,370
.

2009
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:43,970
I hate you.

2010
01:10:44,350 --> 01:10:44,450
.

2011
01:10:44,450 --> 01:10:44,710
.

2012
01:10:44,710 --> 01:10:47,590
Oh, and then.

2013
01:10:47,590 --> 01:10:47,590
.

2014
01:10:48,730 --> 01:10:49,550
We're doing it.

2015
01:10:49,650 --> 01:10:50,010
.

2016
01:10:50,010 --> 01:10:50,810
Okay, guys, go, go, go.

2017
01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:51,090
.

2018
01:10:51,090 --> 01:10:51,750
Go, go, go, go, go.

2019
01:10:52,030 --> 01:10:52,390
.

2020
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:55,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2021
01:10:55,070 --> 01:10:55,310
.

2022
01:10:55,930 --> 01:10:56,290
Yeah.

2023
01:10:56,350 --> 01:10:56,470
.

2024
01:10:56,470 --> 01:10:57,010
It's okay.

2025
01:10:57,150 --> 01:10:57,270
.

2026
01:10:57,910 --> 01:10:59,070
We didn't lose anything.

2027
01:10:59,590 --> 01:10:59,950
.

2028
01:10:59,950 --> 01:11:00,930
Is that just... .

2029
01:11:00,930 --> 01:11:02,250
Okay, let's stop playing.

2030
01:11:02,470 --> 01:11:02,750
.

2031
01:11:03,570 --> 01:11:04,690
What is that?

2032
01:11:05,030 --> 01:11:05,390
.

2033
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:06,290
This way, this way, this way.

2034
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:06,650
.

2035
01:11:08,810 --> 01:11:11,710
So, from zero monsters to all monsters.

2036
01:11:11,810 --> 01:11:12,030
.

2037
01:11:12,030 --> 01:11:13,270
That was so fucking crazy.

2038
01:11:13,590 --> 01:11:13,830
.

2039
01:11:13,830 --> 01:11:14,370
That was so fucking crazy.

2040
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:14,370
.

2041
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:15,210
That was crazy.

2042
01:11:15,530 --> 01:11:15,770
.

2043
01:11:15,770 --> 01:11:16,310
Eh, Nacha?

2044
01:11:16,850 --> 01:11:17,050
.

2045
01:11:18,150 --> 01:11:18,670
.

2046
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:21,830
Hey!

2047
01:11:22,390 --> 01:11:22,390
.

2048
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:27,610
Okay, now we leave.

2049
01:11:28,370 --> 01:11:28,370
.

2050
01:11:30,730 --> 01:11:31,250
.

2051
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:32,230
Well, it looks like... .

2052
01:11:32,230 --> 01:11:32,450
It's Hiro!

2053
01:11:32,610 --> 01:11:32,970
.

2054
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:35,230
No, I think, no, Hiro's... .

2055
01:11:35,230 --> 01:11:36,350
Definitely dead.

2056
01:11:36,510 --> 01:11:37,350
No, she's... .

2057
01:11:37,350 --> 01:11:38,110
She's gone.

2058
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:38,870
.

2059
01:11:39,490 --> 01:11:40,250
She's gone.

2060
01:11:40,510 --> 01:11:40,950
.

2061
01:11:40,950 --> 01:11:40,990
.

2062
01:11:45,370 --> 01:11:45,930
.

2063
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:46,870
It was for content.

2064
01:11:47,110 --> 01:11:47,310
.

2065
01:11:47,310 --> 01:11:47,430
Okay.

2066
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:48,070
.

2067
01:11:48,910 --> 01:11:49,470
Wait.

2068
01:11:49,690 --> 01:11:49,950
.

2069
01:11:49,950 --> 01:11:50,970
It's just a prank.

2070
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:51,250
.

2071
01:11:52,310 --> 01:11:52,870
.

2072
01:11:52,870 --> 01:11:53,050
Okay.

2073
01:11:53,370 --> 01:11:53,650
.

2074
01:11:53,650 --> 01:11:55,210
Oh, she was like zero dollars.

2075
01:11:55,450 --> 01:11:55,970
.

2076
01:11:55,970 --> 01:11:56,670
.

2077
01:11:56,670 --> 01:11:57,730
Hiro was zero dollars.

2078
01:11:57,790 --> 01:11:58,270
That's good.

2079
01:11:58,470 --> 01:11:58,850
.

2080
01:11:59,990 --> 01:12:00,550
.

2081
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:01,630
Welcome back, Hiro.

2082
01:12:01,930 --> 01:12:02,170
.

2083
01:12:02,170 --> 01:12:04,470
It dragged me to the lasers.

2084
01:12:04,470 --> 01:12:04,790
.

2085
01:12:04,790 --> 01:12:06,510
Oh, you died to the lasers?

2086
01:12:06,830 --> 01:12:07,390
.

2087
01:12:07,390 --> 01:12:08,230
.

2088
01:12:08,230 --> 01:12:09,930
The slime took me to the lasers!

2089
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:10,430
.

2090
01:12:10,430 --> 01:12:12,150
It took me there and I died!

2091
01:12:12,530 --> 01:12:12,590
.

2092
01:12:12,590 --> 01:12:13,350
What the hell?

2093
01:12:13,790 --> 01:12:13,810
.

2094
01:12:13,810 --> 01:12:15,750
Look, see, I didn't die first.

2095
01:12:16,030 --> 01:12:16,190
.

2096
01:12:16,190 --> 01:12:17,790
I didn't die first, guys.

2097
01:12:18,330 --> 01:12:18,730
.

2098
01:12:18,730 --> 01:12:18,810
.

2099
01:12:20,110 --> 01:12:20,650
All right.

2100
01:12:20,830 --> 01:12:21,030
.

2101
01:12:21,770 --> 01:12:22,710
Oh, we can stack.

2102
01:12:22,770 --> 01:12:22,970
.

2103
01:12:22,970 --> 01:12:24,070
Oh, yeah, yeah, we don't... .

2104
01:12:24,070 --> 01:12:24,750
We don't need a... .

2105
01:12:25,790 --> 01:12:26,190
Okay.

2106
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:26,610
.

2107
01:12:28,050 --> 01:12:29,490
Oh, so smart.

2108
01:12:29,790 --> 01:12:30,010
.

2109
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:34,850
.

2110
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:35,590
Yeah, because we... .

2111
01:12:35,590 --> 01:12:36,350
Yeah, tensai.

2112
01:12:36,470 --> 01:12:37,330
We already got our money.

2113
01:12:37,550 --> 01:12:37,910
.

2114
01:12:37,910 --> 01:12:38,150
.

2115
01:12:39,070 --> 01:12:39,510
.

2116
01:12:40,470 --> 01:12:42,330
But we don't have money, okay?

2117
01:12:42,450 --> 01:12:42,750
.

2118
01:12:42,750 --> 01:12:43,410
It's okay.

2119
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:44,930
We'll have money next time.

2120
01:12:45,930 --> 01:12:46,370
.

2121
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:50,400
.

2122
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,100
Okay, good morning.

2123
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:51,780
.

2124
01:12:51,780 --> 01:12:52,920
Good morning, everybody.

2125
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:53,600
.

2126
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:53,900
Good morning.

2127
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:54,380
.

2128
01:12:54,380 --> 01:12:56,620
Are you guys ready to make more content?

2129
01:12:56,940 --> 01:12:57,280
.

2130
01:12:58,460 --> 01:12:58,900
Yeah!

2131
01:12:59,080 --> 01:12:59,440
.

2132
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:00,700
Time for more content!

2133
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:01,140
.

2134
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:03,500
All right, we don't... .

2135
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:05,440
We can't afford anything, though.

2136
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:05,700
.

2137
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:06,600
We're poor now.

2138
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:06,920
.

2139
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:07,500
Oh, yeah, we have one dollar.

2140
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:07,520
.

2141
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:08,540
Yeah, yeah, we have one dollar.

2142
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:08,680
.

2143
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:10,540
We can't afford anything for one dollar.

2144
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:10,700
.

2145
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,140
I need to charge my... .

2146
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:14,140
I need to charge my flashlight.

2147
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:15,020
.

2148
01:13:18,620 --> 01:13:19,140
.

2149
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:20,280
Ditto is eating something.

2150
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:20,960
.

2151
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:22,060
No, what are you eating, Ditto?

2152
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:22,660
.

2153
01:13:22,660 --> 01:13:23,900
What are you eating?

2154
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:24,540
.

2155
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:25,520
.

2156
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:27,700
All right, let's go.

2157
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:28,380
.

2158
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:29,380
Let's go.

2159
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:29,500
.

2160
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:29,960
Let's go.

2161
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,440
It's time to make more content.

2162
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:33,060

2163
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:35,220
Let's go.

2164
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:35,220
It's time to make more content.

2165
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:35,220
.

2166
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:35,600
Content time!

2167
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:36,720
.

2168
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:38,660
Content time!

2169
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:39,040
.

2170
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,460
We got to make money.

2171
01:13:40,660 --> 01:13:40,900
.

2172
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:40,900
We got to make money.

2173
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:41,260
.

2174
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:45,140
We need all the money.

2175
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:50,380
Yeah, Hiro, don't die.

2176
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:51,540
You're always dying, Hiro.

2177
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,100
Hiro, you're always dying.

2178
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:56,380
What do you mean?

2179
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:57,620
Who spawns it?

2180
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,900
Wait, what's this map?

2181
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:02,480
Is this new map?

2182
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,080
Oh, really?

2183
01:14:06,340 --> 01:14:07,400
How is it hard?

2184
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:10,140
There's monsters!

2185
01:14:10,220 --> 01:14:10,640
There's monsters!

2186
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:11,140
There's monsters!

2187
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:14,180
Oh, it's not a snake!

2188
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:14,960
It's a snake!

2189
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:17,320
Film it!

2190
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:17,760
Film it!

2191
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:18,060
Film it!

2192
01:14:18,260 --> 01:14:18,660
Film it!

2193
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:19,100
Film it!

2194
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:19,920
Film it!

2195
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:20,260
Okay,

2196
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:27,720
he's on the

2197
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:34,680
left.

2198
01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:35,180
He's scared.

2199
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:35,580
He's left.

2200
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:37,720
Okay, wait, wait.

2201
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:38,320
Who has hug?

2202
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:38,960
Who has hug?

2203
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:39,940
Wait, wait.

2204
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:40,540
We have hug.

2205
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:41,640
I have hug.

2206
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,020
Hug, hug, hug, hug, hug.

2207
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:44,980
Yes, yay!

2208
01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:46,820
Yay!

2209
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:49,460
Okay, okay.

2210
01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:50,620
I'm full.

2211
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:51,160
Oh, Hiro!

2212
01:14:51,380 --> 01:14:51,900
Hiro!

2213
01:14:52,060 --> 01:14:52,300
Hiro!

2214
01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:55,860
Hiro, Hiro, you need hug!

2215
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:57,120
Hug Hiro!

2216
01:15:04,310 --> 01:15:05,850
You gotta hug Hiro!

2217
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:07,550
Oh my god!

2218
01:15:08,950 --> 01:15:09,670
It's okay.

2219
01:15:09,730 --> 01:15:10,330
He ran away.

2220
01:15:10,410 --> 01:15:11,030
He got scared.

2221
01:15:12,330 --> 01:15:13,550
He got scared.

2222
01:15:14,730 --> 01:15:16,090
Finish him back.

2223
01:15:16,590 --> 01:15:16,810
Oh my god.

2224
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:17,910
Alright, alright.

2225
01:15:17,990 --> 01:15:18,310
It's okay.

2226
01:15:18,370 --> 01:15:18,850
He got scared.

2227
01:15:19,030 --> 01:15:19,710
Someone hug me!

2228
01:15:19,730 --> 01:15:20,570
Someone hug me!

2229
01:15:20,590 --> 01:15:21,190
Okay, okay, okay.

2230
01:15:21,470 --> 01:15:22,490
I can't hug.

2231
01:15:24,110 --> 01:15:24,950
I can't hug.

2232
01:15:25,110 --> 01:15:26,330
I don't like personal touch.

2233
01:15:27,750 --> 01:15:29,010
Hug, hug, hug, hug.

2234
01:15:29,190 --> 01:15:29,550
Nice.

2235
01:15:30,710 --> 01:15:31,430
Thank you.

2236
01:15:31,710 --> 01:15:32,410
Alright, nice.

2237
01:15:32,530 --> 01:15:32,710
Alright.

2238
01:15:34,650 --> 01:15:35,670
Nachan, do you need hug?

2239
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:37,010
Oh, wait.

2240
01:15:37,050 --> 01:15:38,030
Nachan discovered something.

2241
01:15:39,510 --> 01:15:39,870
No!

2242
01:15:39,870 --> 01:15:40,810
No, don't do it!

2243
01:15:40,810 --> 01:15:41,450
I'm gonna do it.

2244
01:15:41,650 --> 01:15:42,950
I'm gonna do it.

2245
01:15:42,950 --> 01:15:43,270
Film me.

2246
01:15:43,410 --> 01:15:43,810
It's a hole.

2247
01:15:43,810 --> 01:15:45,750
Guys, film me!

2248
01:15:50,830 --> 01:15:51,810
I'm okay.

2249
01:15:52,410 --> 01:15:53,790
There's nothing wrong here.

2250
01:15:54,570 --> 01:15:55,750
It's just a hole.

2251
01:15:57,270 --> 01:15:57,950
Guys?

2252
01:15:58,950 --> 01:15:59,630
Guys?

2253
01:16:00,590 --> 01:16:01,270
Guys?

2254
01:16:02,370 --> 01:16:04,250
Did you film it at least?

2255
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:06,210
Guys, jump down!

2256
01:16:08,110 --> 01:16:09,170
Oh no.

2257
01:16:09,710 --> 01:16:11,830
I don't think they jumped down, chat.

2258
01:16:12,350 --> 01:16:15,310
I don't think they jumped down.

2259
01:16:17,090 --> 01:16:17,970
It's okay.

2260
01:16:18,070 --> 01:16:19,390
I've done this before.

2261
01:16:19,650 --> 01:16:20,950
Down is up.

2262
01:16:23,010 --> 01:16:23,950
It's okay.

2263
01:16:25,630 --> 01:16:27,350
I've done this before.

2264
01:16:28,090 --> 01:16:29,530
Down is up.

2265
01:16:30,150 --> 01:16:30,830
Surely.

2266
01:16:32,790 --> 01:16:34,910
Okay, maybe not that down.

2267
01:16:35,450 --> 01:16:36,130
Maybe.

2268
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:42,350
Maybe not that down.

2269
01:16:43,350 --> 01:16:44,030
Guys!

2270
01:16:44,230 --> 01:16:44,910
Guys!

2271
01:16:45,170 --> 01:16:45,290
Guys!

2272
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:45,910
Hello?

2273
01:16:48,130 --> 01:16:48,850
Guys!

2274
01:16:48,930 --> 01:16:52,650
Why didn't nobody jump down with me?

2275
01:16:54,510 --> 01:16:55,850
Oh no.

2276
01:16:55,970 --> 01:16:57,630
I can't believe it.

2277
01:16:57,690 --> 01:17:02,030
I did all of that for content and nobody filmed anything.

2278
01:17:03,050 --> 01:17:05,790
These are unprofessional content creators.

2279
01:17:06,150 --> 01:17:09,450
Am I the only one that takes my job seriously?

2280
01:17:11,550 --> 01:17:12,870
I don't like this.

2281
01:17:13,110 --> 01:17:14,910
Oh, I really don't like this.

2282
01:17:17,910 --> 01:17:18,410
Oh.

2283
01:17:19,470 --> 01:17:21,270
How the fuck do I get out of here?

2284
01:17:22,490 --> 01:17:23,310
Oh no.

2285
01:17:23,970 --> 01:17:25,830
I hope they don't leave me for dead.

2286
01:17:26,650 --> 01:17:28,090
Surely they won't, right?

2287
01:17:28,790 --> 01:17:32,190
Surely I'm more important to them, right?

2288
01:17:32,790 --> 01:17:33,570
Oh no.

2289
01:17:34,290 --> 01:17:35,570
Oh, I don't like this.

2290
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:37,630
I'm so fucking dead, guys.

2291
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:40,450
Wait, I hear you guys!

2292
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:44,960
Where are you guys?

2293
01:17:45,420 --> 01:17:45,920
Oh!

2294
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:46,660
Oh!

2295
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:47,420
I'm dead!

2296
01:17:48,060 --> 01:17:48,740
I'm dead!

2297
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,620
I did it!

2298
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,140
Where is it?

2299
01:17:55,820 --> 01:17:58,300
Viva, we were dying to the 9th of September.

2300
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:00,060
Wait, you were dying to the 9th of September?

2301
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:01,200
I'm the only one.

2302
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,340
I died like 100 HP.

2303
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:05,000
Look at that.

2304
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:09,500
I did all of that and you guys didn't film anything!

2305
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:12,120
You guys didn't film anything.

2306
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:13,760
I can't believe it.

2307
01:18:14,620 --> 01:18:15,760
We have to hide.

2308
01:18:15,820 --> 01:18:16,400
We have to hide.

2309
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:16,660
No.

2310
01:18:18,830 --> 01:18:19,930
We have to hide.

2311
01:18:19,930 --> 01:18:20,110
No.

2312
01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:20,430
No.

2313
01:18:20,430 --> 01:18:25,950
What is that?

2314
01:18:27,470 --> 01:18:28,910
Oh my god!

2315
01:18:29,090 --> 01:18:31,110
Oh he hurts, he hurts, he hurts.

2316
01:18:33,270 --> 01:18:36,530
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

2317
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:38,590
Come back, come back, come back, come back.

2318
01:18:38,690 --> 01:18:39,650
Wait, who has the camera?

2319
01:18:40,370 --> 01:18:41,830
Nachan, Nachan, leave her!

2320
01:18:42,570 --> 01:18:43,270
Nachan, leave her!

2321
01:18:44,190 --> 01:18:45,070
She's dead!

2322
01:18:45,790 --> 01:18:46,750
Nachan, she's dead!

2323
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:50,450
Wait, Nachan's dead?

2324
01:18:50,450 --> 01:18:52,090
She has the flashlight.

2325
01:18:52,610 --> 01:18:53,270
Okay, let's go.

2326
01:18:53,830 --> 01:18:55,310
Let's leave, let's leave, let's leave.

2327
01:18:55,730 --> 01:18:58,150
Wait, did you film him already?

2328
01:18:58,690 --> 01:18:59,170
Yeah!

2329
01:18:59,310 --> 01:19:01,090
Okay, nice, nice, nice.

2330
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:02,410
Wait, wait, wait.

2331
01:19:02,470 --> 01:19:05,470
That one, the one that has big guy?

2332
01:19:05,730 --> 01:19:06,130
Yeah?

2333
01:19:07,590 --> 01:19:10,270
We can just flashlight to him, okay?

2334
01:19:10,430 --> 01:19:11,690
Oh, okay.

2335
01:19:12,070 --> 01:19:15,650
Yeah, if we just flashlight to him.

2336
01:19:16,170 --> 01:19:17,150
Oh, I see.

2337
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:17,910
Okay, I need hugs.

2338
01:19:18,010 --> 01:19:18,570
Thank you.

2339
01:19:18,970 --> 01:19:20,110
Thank you for the hug.

2340
01:19:20,450 --> 01:19:21,810
Thank you for the hug.

2341
01:19:22,130 --> 01:19:24,430
Wait, I still have film.

2342
01:19:25,110 --> 01:19:26,050
Oh, you still have film?

2343
01:19:26,130 --> 01:19:27,470
Okay, okay, okay, we hug each other.

2344
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:29,810
We end it with a hug.

2345
01:19:32,630 --> 01:19:33,390
Okay, okay, okay.

2346
01:19:34,070 --> 01:19:35,210
Okay, you still have film, right?

2347
01:19:36,670 --> 01:19:37,450
Nachan died!

2348
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:40,590
It's okay, we don't have to pay money for her death.

2349
01:19:40,790 --> 01:19:41,630
That's the best part.

2350
01:19:41,770 --> 01:19:42,150
Alright, alright.

2351
01:19:43,890 --> 01:19:45,270
Wait, who has the hug?

2352
01:19:45,350 --> 01:19:46,430
I have one.

2353
01:19:47,810 --> 01:19:48,630
Okay, okay, okay.

2354
01:19:48,670 --> 01:19:49,210
Wait, wait.

2355
01:19:49,290 --> 01:19:49,570
Alright.

2356
01:19:50,450 --> 01:19:51,930
Someone hug and then we film it.

2357
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:53,810
Okay.

2358
01:19:54,150 --> 01:19:55,890
Okay, I'll do the sound effects.

2359
01:19:57,010 --> 01:19:58,330
Someone... Okay, wait, wait, wait.

2360
01:19:59,190 --> 01:19:59,670
Okay.

2361
01:19:59,810 --> 01:20:01,410
Okay, ready?

2362
01:20:01,610 --> 01:20:02,090
Three...

2363
01:20:02,090 --> 01:20:03,770
Okay, three, two, one.

2364
01:20:16,330 --> 01:20:17,290
That was...

2365
01:20:17,290 --> 01:20:18,410
That was great.

2366
01:20:18,810 --> 01:20:20,210
That was a great...

2367
01:20:20,210 --> 01:20:21,990
That was a great...

2368
01:20:22,790 --> 01:20:24,270
That was a great hug.

2369
01:20:24,270 --> 01:20:26,210
I'm 26 years old.

2370
01:20:28,870 --> 01:20:29,310
Emote, emote, emote.

2371
01:20:29,310 --> 01:20:29,810
Alright, there's more?

2372
01:20:30,270 --> 01:20:30,270
Wow!

2373
01:20:31,310 --> 01:20:32,250
Nachan's goals...

2374
01:20:32,690 --> 01:20:33,130
Yeah!

2375
01:20:33,210 --> 01:20:34,630
Emote, emote, emote time.

2376
01:20:35,090 --> 01:20:35,770
Emote, emote, emote.

2377
01:20:35,990 --> 01:20:36,430
Yay!

2378
01:20:37,850 --> 01:20:38,290
Wow!

2379
01:20:39,890 --> 01:20:40,330
Wow!

2380
01:20:42,510 --> 01:20:42,950
Amazing!

2381
01:20:43,850 --> 01:20:44,290
Amazing!

2382
01:20:44,370 --> 01:20:46,330
Wait, wait, wait, I got an idea.

2383
01:20:46,350 --> 01:20:46,750
I got an idea.

2384
01:20:47,130 --> 01:20:48,150
Do you have more film?

2385
01:20:48,430 --> 01:20:49,050
Oh, shit.

2386
01:20:49,210 --> 01:20:50,410
I don't know.

2387
01:20:50,550 --> 01:20:50,990
3%.

2388
01:20:50,990 --> 01:20:52,850
Okay, okay, come here, come here, come here.

2389
01:20:53,010 --> 01:20:53,710
I got an idea.

2390
01:20:53,750 --> 01:20:54,370
Come here, come here, come here.

2391
01:20:54,790 --> 01:20:55,810
Come here, come here, come here.

2392
01:20:56,450 --> 01:20:56,870
Come here.

2393
01:20:57,750 --> 01:20:59,170
Okay, okay, okay.

2394
01:20:59,190 --> 01:21:00,590
I saw this on the internet.

2395
01:21:01,370 --> 01:21:02,630
Okay, Ditto, get on the bed.

2396
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:04,110
Okay.

2397
01:21:04,930 --> 01:21:05,950
Okay, are you ready to film?

2398
01:21:07,610 --> 01:21:08,290
Are you ready?

2399
01:21:08,470 --> 01:21:09,610
Did you lie down in bed?

2400
01:21:10,670 --> 01:21:11,870
Yeah, are you ready?

2401
01:21:11,970 --> 01:21:12,350
Are you ready?

2402
01:21:12,990 --> 01:21:13,350
Yeah.

2403
01:21:14,990 --> 01:21:15,950
What are you gonna do?

2404
01:21:17,730 --> 01:21:18,270
What is that?

2405
01:21:18,490 --> 01:21:19,150
What is that?

2406
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:29,720
Okay, okay.

2407
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:30,940
Okay, nothing.

2408
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:31,900
We didn't do anything.

2409
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:34,240
What?

2410
01:21:34,420 --> 01:21:34,480
What?

2411
01:21:34,740 --> 01:21:36,120
What are you doing?

2412
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:37,420
What are you doing?

2413
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:38,800
What are you doing?

2414
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:41,340
I did nothing.

2415
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:42,700
I did nothing.

2416
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:43,700
What?

2417
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:45,760
I didn't do anything.

2418
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:46,280
What was that?

2419
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:46,860
Nothing.

2420
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:47,400
It was nothing.

2421
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:47,940
Wait, it's over the end.

2422
01:21:52,580 --> 01:21:53,140
It

2423
01:21:57,390 --> 01:21:59,010
was too spicy.

2424
01:21:59,890 --> 01:22:01,090
Oh, no!

2425
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:04,270
The content was too spicy.

2426
01:22:05,470 --> 01:22:06,070
Really?

2427
01:22:06,370 --> 01:22:08,390
We got demonetized.

2428
01:22:09,770 --> 01:22:10,970
Oh, no!

2429
01:22:11,130 --> 01:22:12,110
Okay, okay, okay.

2430
01:22:12,230 --> 01:22:13,470
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

2431
01:22:13,990 --> 01:22:16,430
Wait, wait, wait.

2432
01:22:16,590 --> 01:22:18,210
We watched it yesterday.

2433
01:22:18,930 --> 01:22:20,030
Okay, okay, okay.

2434
01:22:20,830 --> 01:22:22,370
It was like yesterday.

2435
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:23,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2436
01:22:23,390 --> 01:22:25,570
Okay, three, two, one.

2437
01:22:27,930 --> 01:22:28,530
Don't!

2438
01:22:29,950 --> 01:22:30,550
No!

2439
01:22:32,010 --> 01:22:32,490
What?

2440
01:22:33,110 --> 01:22:33,870
So good!

2441
01:22:35,010 --> 01:22:37,250
I wonder if nothing is the keyframe.

2442
01:22:37,610 --> 01:22:38,770
Wait, that's what you mean.

2443
01:22:44,850 --> 01:22:45,330
Huh?

2444
01:22:47,330 --> 01:22:48,550
Okay, I'll just do it.

2445
01:22:48,590 --> 01:22:49,070
I'll interview.

2446
01:22:49,370 --> 01:22:50,150
How do you feel?

2447
01:22:50,150 --> 01:22:51,130
Interview the monsters.

2448
01:22:51,330 --> 01:22:53,070
Interview the monsters when we see them.

2449
01:22:53,110 --> 01:22:54,510
Okay, okay, okay.

2450
01:22:54,810 --> 01:22:54,850
Yeah.

2451
01:22:57,390 --> 01:22:57,870
Alright.

2452
01:22:58,590 --> 01:22:59,570
How do you feel?

2453
01:22:59,650 --> 01:23:00,670
Oh, my God.

2454
01:23:00,670 --> 01:23:01,910
Don't make me look cool.

2455
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:03,370
I'm all confused, me too.

2456
01:23:05,310 --> 01:23:06,090
Are you filming?

2457
01:23:06,170 --> 01:23:06,810
How do you feel today?

2458
01:23:07,410 --> 01:23:08,150
How do you feel today, sir?

2459
01:23:08,710 --> 01:23:09,710
I don't know.

2460
01:23:09,810 --> 01:23:13,550
I have zero monsters.

2461
01:23:13,650 --> 01:23:15,250
I have zero monsters.

2462
01:23:16,290 --> 01:23:17,190
Yeah, we have...

2463
01:23:17,190 --> 01:23:18,830
We need to fucking interview one.

2464
01:23:19,210 --> 01:23:19,470
I'm all cool.

2465
01:23:20,590 --> 01:23:21,610
I'm all cool.

2466
01:23:22,630 --> 01:23:23,110
Are

2467
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:30,660
you okay?

2468
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:31,980
What was that?

2469
01:23:34,420 --> 01:23:37,180
Oh, this is when the thing exploded on us.

2470
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:37,880
That's the radio.

2471
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:38,460
Yeah.

2472
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:39,500
First time.

2473
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:40,520
First time I saw it.

2474
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:41,340
Yeah, it's the radio.

2475
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:41,440
Oh, thank...

2476
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:45,000
It's like Tik Tok.

2477
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:45,960
Dance, dance.

2478
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:47,680
Yeah, we're doing Tik Tok dance.

2479
01:24:00,420 --> 01:24:01,940
That was a good cut.

2480
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:03,140
That was a good cut.

2481
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:05,960
We can save.

2482
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:07,140
We can save.

2483
01:24:07,220 --> 01:24:08,140
We can save the cut here.

2484
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,220
I save the video.

2485
01:24:09,380 --> 01:24:10,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2486
01:24:10,220 --> 01:24:11,200
I save the video.

2487
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:11,620
Okay.

2488
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:12,180
Next video.

2489
01:24:13,940 --> 01:24:14,820
Learning hard.

2490
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:16,040
I like hands.

2491
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:17,940
You like hands?

2492
01:24:28,510 --> 01:24:36,490
What the fuck

2493
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:45,300
is going on?

2494
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:06,340
You saw film right?

2495
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:27,760
Emo time!

2496
01:25:28,580 --> 01:25:30,000
Hey hey hey hey!

2497
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:30,760
Wow!

2498
01:25:32,620 --> 01:25:33,220
Wow!

2499
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:35,620
That's amazing!

01:31:56,860 --> 01:31:57,680
Go away.

2691
01:31:58,220 --> 01:32:00,240
Oh my god.

2692
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:05,880
Oh my god.

2693
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:06,840
Oh my god.

2694
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:08,640
Why would they push the camera man?

2695
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:11,240
Push push.

2696
01:32:11,340 --> 01:32:11,620
No.

2697
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:12,300
No.

2698
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:13,040
No.

2699
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:18,720
No.

2700
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:19,800
It was an accident.

2701
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:22,300
What is this?

2702
01:32:22,300 --> 01:32:23,480
What is this?

2703
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:26,720
It was an accident.

2704
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:30,380
It was an accident.

2705
01:32:30,980 --> 01:32:32,580
Cairo Cairo let's go home.

2706
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:36,000
They don't have the camera.

2707
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:39,000
We have to find a way out of this.

2708
01:32:39,340 --> 01:32:40,860
I don't know.

2709
01:32:40,860 --> 01:32:41,940
I can't believe it.

2710
01:32:41,980 --> 01:32:45,220
I worked so hard on making such good content.

2711
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,580
I can't believe it.

2712
01:32:48,340 --> 01:32:49,900
All my content.

2713
01:32:50,120 --> 01:32:52,380
My first directorial debut.

2714
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:53,280
Hello.

2715
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:54,900
Hello.

2716
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:56,420
Hello.

2717
01:32:56,460 --> 01:32:58,160
They would do this to me.

2718
01:32:58,760 --> 01:32:59,680
Oh this way.

2719
01:33:00,740 --> 01:33:01,320
Yes.

2720
01:33:01,460 --> 01:33:02,500
This is what they get.

2721
01:33:02,700 --> 01:33:04,680
I'm glad I told them to all go downstairs.

2722
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:09,660
I can't believe it.

2723
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:13,900
My first directorial debut.

2724
01:33:15,980 --> 01:33:17,280
I hope Ditto dies.

2725
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:17,560
I hope Ditto dies.

2726
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:18,620
Oh no.

2727
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:20,520
Come here.

2728
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:20,780
Come here.

2729
01:33:24,220 --> 01:33:26,140
Wait what the fuck was that?

2730
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:29,220
What the fuck was that?

2731
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:31,020
What is that?

2732
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:35,020
What was that?

2733
01:33:35,260 --> 01:33:35,300
I'm there.

2734
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:37,860
No no no.

2735
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:39,580
Ditto.

2736
01:33:42,120 --> 01:33:43,120
Oh my god.

2737
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:43,800
This

2738
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:51,600
one is easy.

2739
01:33:51,740 --> 01:33:52,480
Okay let's go.

2740
01:33:52,580 --> 01:33:52,800
Let's go.

2741
01:33:52,860 --> 01:33:53,060
Let's go.

2742
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:54,120
Oh my god.

2743
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:54,840
Oh this way.

2744
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:55,820
I remember this.

2745
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:59,620
I remember these maze that I have to go through.

2746
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:00,500
Okay okay let's go.

2747
01:34:00,660 --> 01:34:00,780
Let's go.

2748
01:34:01,860 --> 01:34:03,860
If I was still alive.

2749
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:05,660
I would have take them home.

2750
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:15,460
This was the exact same way I did to find my way home.

2751
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:15,860
Okay.

2752
01:34:15,860 --> 01:34:16,120
Okay.

2753
01:34:16,220 --> 01:34:16,920
Let's go.

2754
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:17,480
Let's go.

2755
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:20,400
How can they go home without the camera?

2756
01:34:21,820 --> 01:34:23,560
I can't believe they would survive.

2757
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:25,400
I can't believe it.

2758
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:30,440
They did not deserve it.

2759
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:31,900
They did not deserve to live.

2760
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:34,020
They should have died with me!

2761
01:34:35,100 --> 01:34:39,900
If they were true homies, they would die with me!

2762
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:46,160
What the fuck?

2763
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:48,280
Why is that so funny?

2764
01:34:54,510 --> 01:34:56,110
Holy shit!

2765
01:34:56,390 --> 01:34:57,810
What the fuck?

2766
01:35:01,810 --> 01:35:03,520
I can't believe it.

2767
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:07,100
My hospital bill is 26?

2768
01:35:07,780 --> 01:35:09,100
Who pushed me?

2769
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:10,240
Who pushed me?

2770
01:35:10,460 --> 01:35:11,100
Dedo!

2771
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:13,380
Dedo!

2772
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:14,600
Dedo!

2773
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:15,720
I got it!

2774
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:16,360
I got it!

2775
01:35:16,900 --> 01:35:19,440
You know it's you!

2776
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:20,620
It's you!

2777
01:35:21,740 --> 01:35:23,380
It was you!

2778
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:27,760
Who else would it be?

2779
01:35:32,740 --> 01:35:34,020
I'm going to sleep.

2780
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:36,940
Now I'm mad.

2781
01:35:45,020 --> 01:35:46,880
Now I'm mad.

2782
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:48,200
Rage video.

2783
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:50,740
Sleepy sleeping.

2784
01:35:53,940 --> 01:35:54,980
Okay, wait.

2785
01:35:57,080 --> 01:35:57,740
It's me.

2786
01:35:58,140 --> 01:35:58,980
Sleepy!

2787
01:35:58,980 --> 01:35:59,820
It's me.

2788
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,500
It's me.

2789
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:06,080
Your face is so bad!

2790
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:07,420
Goki's face.

2791
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:11,120
Now I'm mad.

2792
01:36:11,940 --> 01:36:12,100
Look at her face.

2793
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,060
Why are you mad?

2794
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,920
Now I'm mad.

2795
01:36:20,060 --> 01:36:21,480
Now I'm mad.

2796
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:23,120
Now I hope we never become famous.

2797
01:36:24,140 --> 01:36:24,840
Now I'm mad.

2798
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:26,820
I hope we never become famous.

2799
01:36:27,460 --> 01:36:28,360
Oh no.

2800
01:36:30,900 --> 01:36:32,700
I have camera again.

2801
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:36,360
Do we...

2802
01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:38,040
Film again, film again.

2803
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:39,480
You dropped the last time.

2804
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:39,880
Okay.

2805
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:42,560
I'm mad now.

2806
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:43,560
I'm mad now.

2807
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:45,040
I'm mad now.

2808
01:36:46,120 --> 01:36:47,960
We have... okay, wait.

2809
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:49,500
What do we have?

2810
01:36:49,820 --> 01:36:51,220
How much money do we have left?

2811
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:52,060
Okay, we have...

2812
01:36:54,580 --> 01:36:55,160
234.

2813
01:36:55,660 --> 01:36:55,660
Okay.

2814
01:36:57,940 --> 01:36:58,800
Let's see.

2815
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:00,760
Oh, we should!

2816
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:04,160
Oh yeah, shopping time!

2817
01:37:04,260 --> 01:37:04,720
Shopping time!

2818
01:37:12,010 --> 01:37:12,690
Don't worry.

2819
01:37:13,250 --> 01:37:14,670
I got us content.

2820
01:37:17,250 --> 01:37:17,830
Yeah.

2821
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:23,940
Watch this.

2822
01:37:31,150 --> 01:37:31,460
Content.

2823
01:37:32,660 --> 01:37:35,100
Can I film myself while doing this?

2824
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:35,860
Can I do that?

2825
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:39,860
I don't know.

2826
01:37:44,460 --> 01:37:46,120
We have no money.

2827
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:47,800
We can?

2828
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:51,860
Oh, $20?

2829
01:37:51,980 --> 01:37:52,200
Okay.

2830
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:55,720
I lost it.

2831
01:37:56,460 --> 01:37:57,300
Alright, let's go.

2832
01:37:57,400 --> 01:37:58,380
You guys ready for content?

2833
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:00,180
Okay, I'm ready!

2834
01:38:00,380 --> 01:38:00,940
Content time.

2835
01:38:01,540 --> 01:38:02,340
Let's go.

2836
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:02,800
Let's go.

2837
01:38:02,840 --> 01:38:03,120
Let's go.

2838
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:04,820
You know what?

2839
01:38:04,820 --> 01:38:05,960
Nachan, you should be leader.

2840
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:07,480
Nachan.

2841
01:38:07,620 --> 01:38:08,140
Nachan.

2842
01:38:08,380 --> 01:38:08,900
Leader.

2843
01:38:12,140 --> 01:38:12,960
I'm leader?

2844
01:38:13,180 --> 01:38:14,140
Yeah, you're leader.

2845
01:38:14,460 --> 01:38:15,080
Yeah, you go.

2846
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:15,680
You go.

2847
01:38:15,820 --> 01:38:16,600
We follow.

2848
01:38:17,380 --> 01:38:18,840
We follow you, Nachan.

2849
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:20,680
Follow me.

2850
01:38:21,100 --> 01:38:21,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2851
01:38:22,660 --> 01:38:23,420
Follow me.

2852
01:38:24,460 --> 01:38:25,800
Oh, it's this again.

2853
01:38:29,180 --> 01:38:30,380
Oh, it's here again.

2854
01:38:33,910 --> 01:38:35,150
Where do we go, Nachan?

2855
01:38:39,890 --> 01:38:40,370
Okay.

2856
01:38:40,730 --> 01:38:41,190
Okay.

2857
01:38:41,470 --> 01:38:41,930
Okay.

2858
01:38:42,910 --> 01:38:43,970
Where do we go?

2859
01:38:44,110 --> 01:38:44,450
I'm following you.

2860
01:38:44,710 --> 01:38:45,410
We're following?

2861
01:38:45,650 --> 01:38:46,010
I'm following you.

2862
01:38:46,490 --> 01:38:47,670
Whoa, look at all this.

2863
01:38:48,110 --> 01:38:48,870
What is this?

2864
01:38:51,930 --> 01:38:52,910
It's just glasses.

2865
01:38:52,910 --> 01:38:53,390
Glasses?

2866
01:38:55,930 --> 01:38:57,590
Where are the monsters, though?

2867
01:39:04,730 --> 01:39:05,250
Monsters.

2868
01:39:07,150 --> 01:39:07,670
Nachan.

2869
01:39:07,790 --> 01:39:07,970
Nachan.

2870
01:39:08,070 --> 01:39:08,230
Nachan.

2871
01:39:08,330 --> 01:39:08,510
Nachan.

2872
01:39:09,470 --> 01:39:09,990
Okay.

2873
01:39:10,150 --> 01:39:10,610
Okay.

2874
01:39:10,750 --> 01:39:14,010
This time, someone should die for content, though.

2875
01:39:14,150 --> 01:39:15,250
We would get more money.

2876
01:39:18,310 --> 01:39:20,910
Wouldn't we get more money if somebody dies on camera?

2877
01:39:21,670 --> 01:39:22,750
I think so.

2878
01:39:22,990 --> 01:39:23,390
Yeah.

2879
01:39:24,110 --> 01:39:26,050
Nachan, as leader, you should do it.

2880
01:39:27,550 --> 01:39:27,990
Nachan.

2881
01:39:27,990 --> 01:39:28,750
You die.

2882
01:39:29,030 --> 01:39:29,810
Nachan, go die.

2883
01:39:29,890 --> 01:39:30,090
Go, yeah.

2884
01:39:30,150 --> 01:39:30,710
Nachan, go die.

2885
01:39:31,830 --> 01:39:32,550
Yes, die.

2886
01:39:32,610 --> 01:39:32,970
Yes, die.

2887
01:39:33,030 --> 01:39:34,390
Why is it you guys?

2888
01:39:34,430 --> 01:39:34,910
You guys.

2889
01:39:34,930 --> 01:39:36,010
Nachan, you should do it.

2890
01:39:36,650 --> 01:39:37,750
It'll be so funny.

2891
01:39:38,710 --> 01:39:39,890
It'll be so funny.

2892
01:39:40,170 --> 01:39:40,330
It's a monster.

2893
01:39:41,350 --> 01:39:43,910
How can you tell Nachan go die, though?

2894
01:39:45,210 --> 01:39:46,010
It's a monster.

2895
01:39:47,470 --> 01:39:48,790
No, no monster.

2896
01:39:49,050 --> 01:39:49,670
No monster.

2897
01:39:49,670 --> 01:39:49,870
Nachan.

2898
01:39:50,550 --> 01:39:50,990
Hi.

2899
01:39:51,990 --> 01:39:52,130
Hello.

2900
01:39:52,650 --> 01:39:53,090
Yeah?

2901
01:39:53,330 --> 01:39:54,070
What was it?

2902
01:39:54,910 --> 01:39:55,350
Hi.

2903
01:39:55,350 --> 01:39:56,310
Oh, we can go.

2904
01:39:56,310 --> 01:39:57,030
We can go now.

2905
01:39:57,190 --> 01:39:57,530
We can go.

2906
01:40:01,770 --> 01:40:02,210
Nice.

2907
01:40:02,690 --> 01:40:03,410
I'm a leader.

2908
01:40:03,710 --> 01:40:04,410
I'm a leader.

2909
01:40:04,670 --> 01:40:05,110
Yeah.

2910
01:40:05,250 --> 01:40:05,550
Okay, go.

2911
01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:06,190
Go.

2912
01:40:06,190 --> 01:40:06,970
Oh, what's that?

2913
01:40:07,730 --> 01:40:08,630
Nachan, touch it.

2914
01:40:09,970 --> 01:40:10,750
Okay, okay, okay.

2915
01:40:10,770 --> 01:40:11,610
Go touch it.

2916
01:40:11,730 --> 01:40:12,050
Oh.

2917
01:40:14,250 --> 01:40:15,030
Nachan, please.

2918
01:40:15,030 --> 01:40:15,390
I can't.

2919
01:40:15,450 --> 01:40:15,930
I can't.

2920
01:40:16,030 --> 01:40:16,890
Come here.

2921
01:40:16,890 --> 01:40:17,290
I can't.

2922
01:40:17,450 --> 01:40:18,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2923
01:40:18,290 --> 01:40:19,910
Just hug after you touch it.

2924
01:40:20,130 --> 01:40:20,470
Wait.

2925
01:40:20,470 --> 01:40:20,890
What's that?

2926
01:40:21,450 --> 01:40:21,890
Hey.

2927
01:40:22,250 --> 01:40:22,270
Walk.

2928
01:40:22,450 --> 01:40:22,850
Walk.

2929
01:40:22,850 --> 01:40:22,910
Walk.

2930
01:40:22,910 --> 01:40:22,930
Walk.

2931
01:40:23,150 --> 01:40:23,910
What was that?

2932
01:40:24,030 --> 01:40:24,430
Walk.

2933
01:40:24,430 --> 01:40:24,450
Walk.

2934
01:40:24,450 --> 01:40:24,490
Walk.

2935
01:40:24,490 --> 01:40:24,950
This is monster.

2936
01:40:24,950 --> 01:40:25,050
Wow.

2937
01:40:25,810 --> 01:40:26,850
What is that?

2938
01:40:27,070 --> 01:40:27,690
What is that?

2939
01:40:27,690 --> 01:40:28,210
That's a monster.

2940
01:40:28,350 --> 01:40:28,950
Did you see that?

2941
01:40:30,390 --> 01:40:30,790
Yes.

2942
01:40:31,450 --> 01:40:32,430
Nachan, are you there?

2943
01:40:32,770 --> 01:40:33,250
You're flaming.

2944
01:40:33,450 --> 01:40:34,250
Oh, Nachan.

2945
01:40:35,090 --> 01:40:35,790
Do you flame it?

2946
01:40:35,870 --> 01:40:36,470
Do you flame it?

2947
01:40:36,590 --> 01:40:36,790
Oh!

2948
01:40:43,080 --> 01:40:43,480
Okay.

2949
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:46,340
Someone help me.

2950
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:50,420
Champu, champu, champu, champu, champu, champu, champu, champu, champu.

2951
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:50,860
Okay, okay.

2952
01:40:51,320 --> 01:40:52,580
Okay, someone hug me.

2953
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:54,720
Wait, wait.

2954
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:55,220
Who has hugged?

2955
01:40:55,220 --> 01:40:55,440
Hold on.

2956
01:40:56,240 --> 01:40:57,300
Hug me, hug me.

2957
01:40:57,300 --> 01:40:58,820
Yeah, hug me, yeah.

2958
01:41:01,300 --> 01:41:02,840
Nice, okay, I'm okay now.

2959
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:03,960
Okay.

2960
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:06,200
Hiro, Hiro, Hiro.

2961
01:41:06,920 --> 01:41:07,440
Hiro?

2962
01:41:09,340 --> 01:41:10,420
Is Hiro dead?

2963
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:12,020
I think Hiro died.

2964
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:13,800
Yeah.

2965
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:18,380
I think she's dead.

2966
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:21,720
Hiro?

2967
01:41:22,720 --> 01:41:23,780
Yeah, she's dead.

2968
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:25,880
Wait, does she have the defibrillator?

2969
01:41:27,620 --> 01:41:28,800
Wait, who has it?

2970
01:41:28,820 --> 01:41:29,780
Who has the defib?

2971
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:32,560
Yeah, she has it.

2972
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:34,380
We have to go back to...

Yeah, we can revive her.

2975
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:40,440
Oh, there she is.

2976
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:41,000
There's her dead body.

2977
01:41:41,060 --> 01:41:42,180
Before you revive her.

2978
01:41:42,940 --> 01:41:43,980
Before you revive her.

2979
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:46,360
What's that?

2980
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:48,000
What's that?

2981
01:41:48,940 --> 01:41:50,160
Okay, someone revive her.

01:41:55,540 --> 01:41:56,720
She's reviving!

2988

01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:01,840
Oh, shit!

Oh, my God!

2992
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:06,240
I'm dead.

Oh, my God!

I heard you were revived.

2996
01:42:13,100 --> 01:42:13,840
I didn't die.

2997
01:42:14,900 --> 01:42:18,540
I'm gonna revive you.

2998
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:21,320
Oh, I'm okay!

01:42:29,700 --> 01:42:30,580
Alright, let's go.

He don't heal.

3008
01:42:32,240 --> 01:42:33,240
He don't die again.

3009
01:42:33,300 --> 01:42:34,920
He don't die again.

3010
01:42:36,260 --> 01:42:38,620
We gotta get out of here!

We're good.

3022

We can revive her.

3023
01:43:02,160 --> 01:43:02,720
We can revive her.

Don't worry.

3036
01:43:14,060 --> 01:43:14,480
Okay, okay.

3037
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:15,980
Am I hugging?

3038
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:16,500
Okay, okay.

Okay.

Okay, wait, but watch this.

One more!

3045
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:24,400
Okay, alright.

We're good.

Alright, alright.

Okay.

3051

Because we have to go anyway.

3052
01:43:30,060 --> 01:43:32,900
Are we going to let... Are we going to revive Hiro?

3053
01:43:34,420 --> 01:43:37,040
No, we can't because it's still battling.

3054
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:37,520
No, we can't because it's still battling.

3055
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:37,520
Okay.

3056
01:43:37,680 --> 01:43:38,440
Alright, let's go.

3057
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:38,820
Let's leave.

01:43:43,380 --> 01:43:43,780
Where do we go?

3061
01:43:43,780 --> 01:43:44,020
Wait, Nacha!

3062
01:43:44,540 --> 01:43:44,940
Leader!

Nacha!

3070
01:43:54,900 --> 01:43:55,920
We have to go back.

3071
01:43:57,340 --> 01:43:58,500
Okay, okay, okay.

3072
01:43:59,240 --> 01:44:00,060
Okay, okay, okay.

3073

Go home.

3074
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:01,780
Go home.

Home time.

3077
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:03,460
Home time.

3078
01:44:03,880 --> 01:44:07,200
If we run out of the ocean, we will die too.

3079
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:08,240
Oh, yeah, yeah.

3080
01:44:08,260 --> 01:44:08,540

01:44:08,620 --> 01:44:08,820
That's true.

3082
01:44:08,900 --> 01:44:10,240
We have to... Home time.

3083
01:44:10,440 --> 01:44:11,380
I believe in you.

3084
01:44:12,340 --> 01:44:13,360

We can do this.

3088
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:19,120
Okay.

We go up.

3092
01:44:22,260 --> 01:44:23,700
Where is home?

3093
01:44:24,780 --> 01:44:26,140
We're gonna die.

3094
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:28,480
Nice.

3095
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:29,340
Oh, nice!

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3100
01:44:39,320 --> 01:44:41,340
We go here and then right.

3101
01:44:42,280 --> 01:44:43,320
And then...

3102
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:45,280

What's 320?

3229
01:49:24,810 --> 01:49:25,890
Should we save our money?

3230
01:49:28,750 --> 01:49:29,770
Okay, I need a flashlight.

3231
01:49:31,570 --> 01:49:32,910
Yeah, I need a flashlight though.

3232
01:49:39,570 --> 01:49:40,990
I saved the channel.

01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:07,540
300 exactly!

3243
01:50:08,540 --> 01:50:10,920

Yeah, wait.

3245
01:50:11,660 --> 01:50:13,460
Why did you add two party profit?

3246
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:15,580
Oh my god!

I'll try.

3251
01:50:19,340 --> 01:50:21,400
Oh my god, you should film yourself doing a backflip.

3252
01:50:24,120 --> 01:50:25,220
It's gonna look good.

3253
01:50:25,540 --> 01:50:27,360
Yeah, film yourself with a backflip.

3254
01:50:28,300 --> 01:50:30,040
What will it look like?

3255
01:50:33,770 --> 01:50:34,250
Oh!

3256
01:50:34,990 --> 01:50:35,850

Oh my god, that was beautiful.

3258
01:50:40,770 --> 01:50:41,730
That was...

3259
01:50:42,690 --> 01:50:43,730
10 out of 10.

3260
01:50:43,830 --> 01:50:44,930
It was so beautiful.

3261
01:50:45,430 --> 01:50:46,030
Did I do it?

3262
01:50:46,110 --> 01:50:46,570
Yeah, yeah.

3263
01:50:46,570 --> 01:50:46,870
No, no.

3264
01:50:46,910 --> 01:50:47,490
Yeah, you did.

You definitely did.

3269
01:50:49,950 --> 01:50:51,250
You definitely did, Yerro.

3270
01:50:53,670 --> 01:50:54,610
It was...

3271
01:50:54,610 --> 01:50:55,110
Are you flaming?

3272
01:50:55,110 --> 01:50:56,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3273
01:50:56,390 --> 01:50:57,030
She filmed it.

3274
01:50:57,090 --> 01:50:57,790
Yeah, I did!

3275
01:50:58,150 --> 01:50:58,750
Oh, okay.

3276
01:50:58,910 --> 01:50:59,450
That was nice.

3277
01:51:03,190 --> 01:51:04,710
It was so sick.

3278
01:51:06,270 --> 01:51:08,870
It was like the best backflip I've ever seen.

3279
01:51:09,970 --> 01:51:10,410
Wow!

3280
01:51:10,650 --> 01:51:11,170
Thank you!

3281
01:51:11,470 --> 01:51:12,150
Oh my gosh.

3282
01:51:12,150 --> 01:51:14,130
Is this the same map or a new map?

3283
01:51:14,210 --> 01:51:15,430
Oh, it's this map.

3284
01:51:16,690 --> 01:51:17,790
Yeah, it's this map.

3285
01:51:18,110 --> 01:51:18,210
Okay.

Cheap!

3320
01:52:22,160 --> 01:52:22,720
I know.

3321
01:52:22,780 --> 01:52:23,300
So cheap.

3322
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:25,320
It's almost the same price as a membership.

3323
01:52:25,820 --> 01:52:27,200
That's how cheap it is.

3324
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:28,560
What is this?

3325
01:52:33,600 --> 01:52:34,620
There's a monster.

3326
01:52:34,840 --> 01:52:35,860
We need to make money.

3327
01:52:38,020 --> 01:52:42,420
I heard if we stay longer, there would be bigger monsters.

3328
01:52:44,660 --> 01:52:50,420
Yeah, we just have to stay longer for bigger monsters to show up.

3329
01:52:52,580 --> 01:52:53,220
Monster!

3330
01:52:58,140 --> 01:52:59,480
I think we're not...

3331
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:01,320
No, we want to see big monsters.

3332
01:53:01,340 --> 01:53:02,840
Big monsters equals more views.

3333
01:53:03,020 --> 01:53:03,440
Oh, there's more!

3334
01:53:03,480 --> 01:53:03,800
There's more!

3335
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:04,960
There's more spines!

3336
01:53:05,080 --> 01:53:05,700
Film it!

3337
01:53:06,580 --> 01:53:09,060
I can... Look at all these spines.

3338
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:11,980
Woah!

3339
01:53:11,980 --> 01:53:13,380
This will make good soup!

3340
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:14,660
Good soup!

3341
01:53:17,380 --> 01:53:19,220
I'm gonna put it in my soup base.

3342
01:53:20,100 --> 01:53:22,600
Wait, how do... Is this Dead End?

3343
01:53:23,480 --> 01:53:24,080
Where's door?

3344
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:26,780
Oh, the sword!

3345
01:53:26,860 --> 01:53:27,040
Sword!

3346
01:53:27,180 --> 01:53:27,220
Sword!

3347
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:32,960
Bye-bye!

Oh, she's dead.

3352
01:53:39,680 --> 01:53:40,080
Hug!

3353
01:53:42,620 --> 01:53:43,560
Oh, she's dead.

3354
01:53:43,640 --> 01:53:44,620
Oh, she's dead again.

3355
01:53:44,760 --> 01:53:45,300
She's dead again.

3356
01:53:45,400 --> 01:53:45,780
Revive!

3357
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:46,520
Revive that chat!

3358
01:53:46,580 --> 01:53:48,040
Revive that chat so I can hug her!

3359
01:53:56,140 --> 01:53:56,740
She's back!

3360
01:53:56,800 --> 01:53:57,120
She's back!

3361
01:53:57,140 --> 01:53:57,520
She's back!

3362
01:53:57,520 --> 01:53:58,040
She's back!

3363
01:54:00,900 --> 01:54:02,080
Okay, okay, okay.

3364
01:54:02,620 --> 01:54:03,440
We gotta leave!

3365
01:54:03,500 --> 01:54:04,120
We gotta leave!

3366
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:04,920
Where's the exit?

3367
01:54:05,880 --> 01:54:05,880

3368
01:54:05,880 --> 01:54:06,540

01:54:09,160 --> 01:54:09,440
I didn't get you!

3382
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,180
Hey, who's she talking to?

01:54:50,140 --> 01:54:53,600
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.

3400
01:54:56,740 --> 01:54:58,440
Kiss this for the bros.

3401
01:54:58,460 --> 01:54:59,540
You don't kiss your bro.

3402
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:02,420
If they die, you gotta kiss the bro.

3403
01:55:03,480 --> 01:55:05,840
You gotta kiss the homies.

3404
01:55:07,200 --> 01:55:07,560
Okay.

3405
01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:11,800

Okay, don't worry, don't worry.

3409
01:55:24,640 --> 01:55:25,600
Do you need a hug too?

3410
01:55:26,380 --> 01:55:27,000
Okay, don't worry.

3411
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:36,700
I was just hugging the homies.

3412
01:55:39,060 --> 01:55:43,160

Alright, that was it.

3415
01:55:49,080 --> 01:55:50,560
I need someone to hug me.

3416
01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:52,840
You gotta kiss the homies.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Wait.

3421
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:13,940
Wait.

3422
01:56:14,820 --> 01:56:15,820
Why is it dangerous?

3423
01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:18,840
Because they have a dog machine.

3424
01:56:19,160 --> 01:56:19,860
That gun.

3425
01:56:20,020 --> 01:56:20,500
Dog gun.

3426
01:56:20,540 --> 01:56:21,600
Oh, the dog gun.

3427
01:56:21,700 --> 01:56:22,660
Oh, okay, okay.

3428
01:56:22,840 --> 01:56:23,500
Where do we go?

3429
01:56:24,580 --> 01:56:25,420
Where to go?

3430
01:56:37,290 --> 01:56:39,290
Oh my god, oh my god, we gotta leave.

3431
01:56:39,370 --> 01:56:39,890
We gotta leave.

3432
01:56:40,670 --> 01:56:42,090
Oh my god.

3433
01:56:43,090 --> 01:56:43,510

01:56:47,950 --> 01:56:49,010

3435
01:56:49,490 --> 01:56:50,510
Come on, come on.

3436
01:56:50,570 --> 01:56:51,170
Give me, give me, give me.

01:57:00,290 --> 01:57:01,210
Oh, he's gonna die.

3444
01:57:01,230 --> 01:57:01,990
Don't worry, I got a hug.

3445
01:57:02,810 --> 01:57:03,690
I got the kisses.

3446
01:57:04,530 --> 01:57:05,250
Oh, shit.

3447
01:57:05,610 --> 01:57:06,370
I don't want.

3448
01:57:07,210 --> 01:57:08,030
Okay, okay, okay.

3449
01:57:08,150 --> 01:57:08,810
Where is she?

3450
01:57:08,830 --> 01:57:09,330
Where's she at?

3451
01:57:09,950 --> 01:57:10,490
You know?

3452
01:57:13,130 --> 01:57:14,050
Oh my god.

3453
01:57:14,150 --> 01:57:14,890
I can see her.

3454
01:57:15,350 --> 01:57:16,670
Wait, I think she ran up.

3455
01:57:17,270 --> 01:57:17,970
No, she ran.

3456
01:57:18,070 --> 01:57:18,750
This is outside.

3457
01:57:19,150 --> 01:57:19,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3458
01:57:19,570 --> 01:57:20,030
This is outside.

3459
01:57:23,010 --> 01:57:23,830
Did Hiro die?

3460
01:57:23,830 --> 01:57:23,990
Did Hiro die?

3461
01:57:24,670 --> 01:57:25,410
Oh, okay.

3462
01:57:26,210 --> 01:57:27,510
I think she's ran off.

3463
01:57:27,790 --> 01:57:29,070
Did she run away without us?

3464
01:57:29,330 --> 01:57:30,150
Wow, Hiro.

3465
01:57:32,410 --> 01:57:33,130
Wow, Hiro.

3466
01:57:34,330 --> 01:57:34,690
Hiro.

3467
01:57:34,690 --> 01:57:34,710
Hiro.

3468
01:57:35,790 --> 01:57:36,410
Oh, wait.

3469
01:57:36,890 --> 01:57:38,250
Wait, I think she is dead.

3470
01:57:38,490 --> 01:57:38,610
Hiro.

3471
01:57:40,010 --> 01:57:41,170
Wait, but she has the camera.

3472
01:57:42,210 --> 01:57:43,290
Yeah, she has the camera.

3473
01:57:43,750 --> 01:57:44,870
Yeah, she has the camera.

3474
01:57:44,950 --> 01:57:45,510
What do we do?

3475
01:57:46,510 --> 01:57:48,390
We have to go back, go back, go back.

3476
01:57:48,430 --> 01:57:50,170
Okay, not we have to go back.

3477
01:57:50,170 --> 01:57:51,910
One of us has to go back.

3478
01:57:52,570 --> 01:57:53,650
Okay, here's the hug.

3479
01:57:54,730 --> 01:57:55,610
Okay, wait, wait.

3480
01:57:55,750 --> 01:57:56,730
Are we all full HP?

3481
01:57:57,870 --> 01:57:59,610
Yeah, I'm full HP.

3482
01:57:59,830 --> 01:58:00,410
Okay, okay.

3483
01:58:02,010 --> 01:58:05,650
If we talk, it will run out so fast.

3484
01:58:05,730 --> 01:58:06,090
Okay, okay.

3485
01:58:06,110 --> 01:58:06,810
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

3486
01:58:07,750 --> 01:58:08,190
Look,

3487
01:58:27,990 --> 01:58:28,770
it's not my fault.

3488
01:58:30,270 --> 01:58:31,310
It's not my fault.

3489
01:58:31,530 --> 01:58:31,970
Okay?

3490
01:58:32,730 --> 01:58:33,490
Like, look.

3491
01:58:33,570 --> 01:58:35,430
I was dying from lack of oxygen.

3492
01:58:35,430 --> 01:58:39,630
And Hiro and Nachan is definitely dead.

3493
01:58:39,830 --> 01:58:40,190
Right?

3494
01:58:46,950 --> 01:58:50,530
I'm pretty sure Nachan is dead too.

3495
01:58:50,710 --> 01:58:51,910
Like, they're not moving.

3496
01:58:52,290 --> 01:58:53,250
But it's okay, it's okay.

3497
01:58:53,370 --> 01:58:54,090
Dudo is still alive.

3498
01:58:55,130 --> 01:58:56,270
Dudo is still alive.

3499
01:58:58,570 --> 01:58:59,690
She's still moving.

3500
01:58:59,790 --> 01:59:01,290
So technically she's still alive.

3501
01:59:02,510 --> 01:59:04,030
She's coming over?

3502
01:59:04,230 --> 01:59:05,030
I think?

3503
01:59:05,430 --> 01:59:05,990
This is 98.

3504
01:59:06,810 --> 01:59:08,610
Oh, it stopped at 90.

3505
01:59:08,750 --> 01:59:09,930
Oh, no, no, no, it's still moving.

3506
01:59:10,410 --> 01:59:13,170
She has 5% oxygen left, but she's still moving.

3507
01:59:13,330 --> 01:59:13,770
Look!

3508
01:59:13,990 --> 01:59:14,430
Look!

3509
01:59:14,550 --> 01:59:15,650
Look at the manual!

3510
01:59:16,550 --> 01:59:18,030
There's hearts around it.

3511
01:59:18,530 --> 01:59:21,930
I'm giving the homies a kiss for good luck.

3512
01:59:23,150 --> 01:59:23,590
Okay.

3513
01:59:23,670 --> 01:59:24,510
Oh, she's coming back.

3514
01:59:26,030 --> 01:59:29,330
Oh, wouldn't it be funny if she died with 0% oxygen?

3515
01:59:29,510 --> 01:59:30,010
Let me see.

3516
01:59:34,040 --> 01:59:35,440
Oh, she's definitely dead.

3517
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:38,740
Oh, she's dead.

3518
01:59:40,060 --> 01:59:40,980
Oh, she is.

3519
01:59:41,360 --> 01:59:42,520
Wait, 26 meters?

3520
01:59:42,760 --> 01:59:43,860
I might be able to get the camera.

3521
01:59:46,500 --> 01:59:47,720
She may have died here.

3522
01:59:52,850 --> 01:59:53,790
Oh, there it is.

3523
01:59:56,830 --> 01:59:58,310
Oh, she did not get the camera.

3524
02:00:05,610 --> 02:00:06,010
Okay.

3525
02:00:06,010 --> 02:00:08,290
She did not get the camera.

3526
02:00:11,930 --> 02:00:12,450
Okay.

3527
02:00:12,450 --> 02:00:12,910
Alright, goodbye.

3528
02:00:14,490 --> 02:00:15,010
Okay.

3529
02:00:22,810 --> 02:00:23,670
It's okay.

3530
02:00:25,450 --> 02:00:25,970
Guys!

3531
02:00:25,970 --> 02:00:26,730
It's okay.

3532
02:00:27,770 --> 02:00:29,750
I got the defibrillator.

3533
02:00:30,290 --> 02:00:31,550
Guys, I got this.

3534
02:00:32,590 --> 02:00:33,550
I got...

3535
02:00:33,550 --> 02:00:33,750
Oh, great.

3536
02:00:33,910 --> 02:00:34,750
It's okay, guys.

3537
02:00:35,290 --> 02:00:35,850
We can get the camera tomorrow.

3538
02:00:35,850 --> 02:00:36,850
I got this bag.

3539
02:00:37,270 --> 02:00:38,690
We can get the camera tomorrow.

3540
02:00:38,750 --> 02:00:40,770
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll get the camera tomorrow.

3541
02:00:48,500 --> 02:00:51,460
It's like, where did Hiro go?

3542
02:00:51,860 --> 02:00:52,560
Hiro, where?

3543
02:00:52,680 --> 02:00:53,940
Everybody missed me.

3544
02:00:54,060 --> 02:00:55,020
Don't go, Hiro.

3545
02:00:58,260 --> 02:00:59,600
It's like, don't go?

3546
02:01:03,240 --> 02:01:04,540
It's okay, I lived.

3547
02:01:05,140 --> 02:01:07,480
Alright, someone take the...

3548
02:01:07,480 --> 02:01:10,580
Alright, someone take the revive.

3549
02:01:10,580 --> 02:01:13,600
Revive and hug.

3550
02:01:13,840 --> 02:01:15,940
I'm all like, hugged out.

3551
02:01:17,390 --> 02:01:18,620
I'm all hugged out now.

3552
02:01:18,780 --> 02:01:20,080
I've hugged too many people.

3553
02:01:23,680 --> 02:01:25,320
No money.

3554
02:01:26,120 --> 02:01:29,020
I have flashlight.

3555
02:01:29,200 --> 02:01:29,680
Yeah.

3556
02:01:34,440 --> 02:01:36,440
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

3557
02:01:36,500 --> 02:01:37,280
17%.

3558
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:38,180
Good thinking.

3559
02:01:38,500 --> 02:01:39,840
I'm recharging.

3560
02:01:40,580 --> 02:01:41,960
I had almost no battery.

3561
02:01:43,330 --> 02:01:43,800
Don't worry.

3562
02:01:45,980 --> 02:01:46,700
Here you go.

3563
02:01:46,820 --> 02:01:48,300
I have to charge this one too.

3564
02:01:48,720 --> 02:01:49,700
Wait, what are you charging?

3565
02:01:49,980 --> 02:01:50,700
Oh, the defib.

3566
02:01:51,740 --> 02:01:52,280
Revive.

3567
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:53,640
Alright guys.

3568
02:01:53,940 --> 02:01:55,000
Are you guys all ready?

3569
02:01:59,980 --> 02:02:00,640
Don't worry.

3570
02:02:01,320 --> 02:02:02,000
Don't worry.

3571
02:02:02,040 --> 02:02:04,780
We're gonna film something really cool.

3572
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:07,660
Don't worry.

3573
02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:08,420
No worries.

3574
02:02:09,230 --> 02:02:11,340
We're gonna make content here.

3575
02:02:12,540 --> 02:02:13,080
Yeah.

3576
02:02:13,080 --> 02:02:13,600
This is new.

3577
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:15,240
This is new.

3578
02:02:15,540 --> 02:02:16,020
Is this new?

3579
02:02:16,020 --> 02:02:16,140
Yeah.

3580
02:02:17,060 --> 02:02:17,540
Oh.

3581
02:02:18,040 --> 02:02:19,220
I've never seen this.

3582
02:02:19,600 --> 02:02:20,080
Wee.

3583
02:02:23,060 --> 02:02:24,320
Alright, I got flashlight.

3584
02:02:25,660 --> 02:02:26,780
Wait, who has camera?

3585
02:02:27,260 --> 02:02:27,760
Wait, who has camera?

3586
02:02:29,840 --> 02:02:30,760
Wait, is that...

3587
02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:31,920
Oh, hug.

3588
02:02:32,600 --> 02:02:34,400
I give you the hug.

3589
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:35,980
Wait, who's hugging?

3590
02:02:36,280 --> 02:02:36,400
Here, here, here.

3591
02:02:36,660 --> 02:02:37,140
Who?

3592
02:02:37,520 --> 02:02:39,480
Wait, I go get the other camera.

3593
02:02:39,740 --> 02:02:40,900
Oh, there's other cam...

3594
02:02:40,900 --> 02:02:41,000
Okay, okay.

3595
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:41,020
Oh.

3596
02:02:41,180 --> 02:02:41,920
I got it, I got it.

3597
02:02:41,940 --> 02:02:42,260
Oh.

3598
02:02:42,580 --> 02:02:43,060
Oh.

3599
02:02:43,060 --> 02:02:43,960
Oh, the other camera.

3600
02:02:44,140 --> 02:02:44,260
Oh.

3601
02:02:45,440 --> 02:02:46,500
Wait, there's another one.

3602
02:02:46,540 --> 02:02:46,840
There's...

3603
02:02:46,840 --> 02:02:47,720
Put me under.

3604
02:02:48,360 --> 02:02:49,160
Look, look, look.

3605
02:02:49,440 --> 02:02:50,260
Film, film, film.

3606
02:02:51,360 --> 02:02:52,000
Okay, now...

3607
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:52,600
Look at this.

3608
02:02:52,880 --> 02:02:53,820
It's so beautiful.

3609
02:02:54,200 --> 02:02:54,600
Wow.

3610
02:02:54,600 --> 02:02:55,420
This is five...

3611
02:02:55,420 --> 02:02:57,360
This is one Akasupa.

3612
02:02:57,780 --> 02:03:00,860
If you want to have this, it is one Akasupa.

3613
02:03:05,780 --> 02:03:07,120
It's so cheap.

3614
02:03:10,380 --> 02:03:10,860
Akasupa.

3615
02:03:11,140 --> 02:03:11,420
Akasupa.

3616
02:03:12,160 --> 02:03:12,640
Akasupa.

3617
02:03:12,700 --> 02:03:13,000
Akasupa.

3618
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:13,040
Akasupa.

3619
02:03:13,040 --> 02:03:13,960
Are we waiting for Hiro?

3620
02:03:14,180 --> 02:03:14,580
Wait, wait.

3621
02:03:14,860 --> 02:03:15,400
Don't eat.

3622
02:03:15,520 --> 02:03:16,420
Wait for Hiro.

3623
02:03:16,680 --> 02:03:17,480
Wait for Hiro?

3624
02:03:17,600 --> 02:03:17,860
Okay.

3625
02:03:18,260 --> 02:03:19,580
Yeah, wait for Hiro.

3626
02:03:19,580 --> 02:03:20,620
I'm going to explore a little.

3627
02:03:22,540 --> 02:03:23,140
Don't worry.

3628
02:03:23,380 --> 02:03:26,420
I'm going to find the monster and bring it to them for content, guys.

3629
02:03:26,820 --> 02:03:27,500
It's going to be...

3630
02:03:27,500 --> 02:03:28,760
Just think about the views, chat.

3631
02:03:28,940 --> 02:03:30,040
Think about the...

3632
02:03:30,040 --> 02:03:30,700
The...

3633
02:03:30,700 --> 02:03:31,380
How much...

3634
02:03:31,380 --> 02:03:34,780
How viral we're going to get when I find the monster.

3635
02:03:40,080 --> 02:03:40,720
Come on.

3636
02:03:41,660 --> 02:03:42,660
I'm right here.

3637
02:03:43,620 --> 02:03:44,580
I'm right here.

3638
02:03:44,580 --> 02:03:44,960
I'm right here.

3639
02:03:44,980 --> 02:03:46,000
Wait, where is it?

3640
02:03:47,660 --> 02:03:48,960
Where did he go?

3641
02:03:49,780 --> 02:03:50,420
Where?

3642
02:03:50,780 --> 02:03:52,560
Did he blow himself up?

3643
02:03:53,060 --> 02:03:54,300
Where did he go?

3644
02:03:57,580 --> 02:03:59,480
Wait, did the monster...

3645
02:03:59,480 --> 02:04:02,540
Did the monster blow himself up?

3646
02:04:04,560 --> 02:04:05,200
Hello?

3647
02:04:06,440 --> 02:04:07,080
Wait.

3648
02:04:07,320 --> 02:04:08,500
They left me.

3649
02:04:09,200 --> 02:04:09,840
Hello?

3650
02:04:11,920 --> 02:04:13,540
I have the flashlight.

3651
02:04:13,580 --> 02:04:14,220
I have the flashlight.

3652
02:04:14,220 --> 02:04:14,480
That's it.

3653
02:04:14,760 --> 02:04:14,960
Okay.

3654
02:04:17,360 --> 02:04:18,540
Where did they go?

3655
02:04:18,920 --> 02:04:19,400
Hello?

3656
02:04:22,360 --> 02:04:23,000
Ditto?

3657
02:04:25,020 --> 02:04:25,660
Ditto?

3658
02:04:27,920 --> 02:04:28,820
Nah, Chen!

3659
02:04:30,420 --> 02:04:31,800
They left me!

3660
02:04:32,140 --> 02:04:34,280
How could they leave me like this?

3661
02:04:35,940 --> 02:04:36,920
Oh no.

3662
02:04:37,600 --> 02:04:38,880
I have nothing.

3663
02:04:40,600 --> 02:04:41,340
What's that?

3664
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:44,080
I can't believe it.

3665
02:04:44,160 --> 02:04:45,340
I would never ditch them.

3666
02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:48,260
That's so fucked up.

3667
02:04:50,480 --> 02:04:52,920
That's so fucked up.

3668
02:04:52,960 --> 02:04:54,200
I would never do such a thing.

3669
02:04:54,900 --> 02:04:55,420
Hello?

3670
02:04:56,840 --> 02:04:57,360
Guys?

3671
02:04:59,740 --> 02:05:00,260
Guys?

3672
02:05:01,940 --> 02:05:03,480
Where the fuck are they?

3673
02:05:04,440 --> 02:05:05,820
Wait, this is a new area.

3674
02:05:07,100 --> 02:05:08,660
Where the fuck is our ship though?

3675
02:05:09,260 --> 02:05:10,020
Oh no.

3676
02:05:10,080 --> 02:05:10,840
Where is our ship?

3677
02:05:12,240 --> 02:05:13,640
Ship is over there.

3678
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:14,620
Oh my god.

3679
02:05:14,640 --> 02:05:15,520
It's so fucking far.

3680
02:05:15,860 --> 02:05:16,600
Why is...

3681
02:05:16,620 --> 02:05:17,260
Why is the ship so...

3682
02:05:17,260 --> 02:05:18,860
What do you mean I'm innocent?

3683
02:05:19,600 --> 02:05:20,860
I never leave anybody.

3684
02:05:21,620 --> 02:05:23,060
I said I was gonna bring...

3685
02:05:23,060 --> 02:05:25,380
I was trying to help us get content.

3686
02:05:26,820 --> 02:05:29,220
I was trying to help us find a monster.

3687
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:31,040
Just to get us content.

3688
02:05:32,760 --> 02:05:33,540
But it's okay.

3689
02:05:34,240 --> 02:05:35,380
I know where they are.

3690
02:05:36,600 --> 02:05:37,000
Okay.

3691
02:05:38,560 --> 02:05:40,980
Let me head back to the ship and see if they're still alive.

3692
02:05:41,780 --> 02:05:42,520
Hello guys?

3693
02:05:43,800 --> 02:05:44,980
Are you guys still alive?

3694
02:05:46,620 --> 02:05:47,440
Are they still moving?

3695
02:05:51,420 --> 02:05:52,360
They're still moving.

3696
02:05:52,560 --> 02:05:52,900
Okay.

3697
02:05:55,540 --> 02:05:56,620
Okay, they're still alive.

3698
02:05:57,320 --> 02:05:58,120
They're very...

3699
02:05:58,120 --> 02:06:00,340
Oh my god, they're getting further and further away from the ship.

3700
02:06:00,500 --> 02:06:02,500
I have no idea where they are.

3701
02:06:06,430 --> 02:06:07,950
Oh my god, they're so far away.

3702
02:06:08,150 --> 02:06:09,790
Guys, they're so fucking far away.

3703
02:06:09,850 --> 02:06:11,070
How the fuck am I supposed to...

3704
02:06:13,170 --> 02:06:13,570
Hello?

3705
02:06:16,610 --> 02:06:18,270
You do not hear jack shit.

3706
02:06:18,270 --> 02:06:20,670
What do you mean you can still hear them?

3707
02:06:20,850 --> 02:06:23,310
Look at how far they are away from me.

3708
02:06:24,450 --> 02:06:26,790
How do you have 60% oxygen still?

3709
02:06:27,870 --> 02:06:28,650
Is this here?

3710
02:06:28,770 --> 02:06:29,450
No, that's Ditto.

3711
02:06:29,670 --> 02:06:31,110
Did they spend their time in the ship?

3712
02:06:31,970 --> 02:06:32,410
Okay.

3713
02:06:33,590 --> 02:06:35,810
Wait, do I lose oxygen if I...

3714
02:06:37,970 --> 02:06:38,410
Alright.

3715
02:06:38,990 --> 02:06:40,950
They're still really far away from me.

3716
02:06:41,670 --> 02:06:42,110
Alright.

3717
02:06:43,930 --> 02:06:44,910
They seem to...

3718
02:06:44,910 --> 02:06:45,210
Yeah, they...

3719
02:06:45,210 --> 02:06:46,290
No, I'm pretty sure they're together.

3720
02:06:46,710 --> 02:06:47,510
I'm pretty sure.

3721
02:06:47,510 --> 02:06:49,270
They just don't have a flashlight at all.

3722
02:06:49,470 --> 02:06:50,230
They just...

3723
02:06:51,650 --> 02:06:52,790
They're definitely together.

3724
02:06:53,070 --> 02:06:54,710
It's just that they don't have a flashlight.

3725
02:06:56,650 --> 02:06:57,170
Alright.

3726
02:06:58,570 --> 02:06:59,090
Okay.

3727
02:06:59,250 --> 02:07:00,170
And they have the camera.

3728
02:07:00,270 --> 02:07:00,910
They're making content.

3729
02:07:02,330 --> 02:07:02,850
Guys?

3730
02:07:04,650 --> 02:07:05,170
Hello?

3731
02:07:07,270 --> 02:07:08,350
Are you guys still alive?

3732
02:07:11,750 --> 02:07:12,270
Guys?

3733
02:07:14,550 --> 02:07:15,070
Yeah!

3734
02:07:16,510 --> 02:07:16,930
Nachan!

3735
02:07:19,170 --> 02:07:20,470
Follow my voice!

3736
02:07:21,370 --> 02:07:25,420
Follow my voice!

3737
02:07:27,580 --> 02:07:28,000
Hello?

3738
02:07:29,400 --> 02:07:30,160
Where are you?

3739
02:07:30,220 --> 02:07:30,740
Are you here?

3740
02:07:30,960 --> 02:07:31,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3741
02:07:31,660 --> 02:07:32,080
I'm up here.

3742
02:07:32,160 --> 02:07:32,500
I'm up here.

3743
02:07:32,800 --> 02:07:33,380
Oh my god!

3744
02:07:33,480 --> 02:07:34,580
Where did you guys go?

3745
02:07:35,380 --> 02:07:35,940
You're alive!

3746
02:07:36,460 --> 02:07:38,830
I'm here.

3747
02:07:39,150 --> 02:07:39,650
Yeah, yeah.

3748
02:07:39,690 --> 02:07:40,590
And I said, wait.

3749
02:07:40,690 --> 02:07:41,590
I said, wait.

3750
02:07:41,670 --> 02:07:42,730
And then I was...

3751
02:07:42,730 --> 02:07:42,990
What?

3752
02:07:43,210 --> 02:07:43,630
What?

3753
02:07:43,690 --> 02:07:44,110
Nachan?

3754
02:07:45,790 --> 02:07:48,210
I said, wait.

3755
02:07:48,630 --> 02:07:49,710
I said, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3756
02:07:49,710 --> 02:07:50,170
Wait here.

3757
02:07:50,330 --> 02:07:51,610
I found a monster!

3758
02:07:51,630 --> 02:07:53,450
I was gonna give you guys content!

3759
02:07:55,210 --> 02:07:56,550
You guys got content?

3760
02:07:58,830 --> 02:07:59,510
Okay, okay.

3761
02:07:59,510 --> 02:08:00,110
Let's go downstairs.

3762
02:08:00,310 --> 02:08:00,710
Let's go downstairs.

3763
02:08:01,370 --> 02:08:02,210
We still have time.

3764
02:08:04,450 --> 02:08:04,970
Yay!

3765
02:08:09,720 --> 02:08:12,500
I found like a monster when you guys weren't here.

3766
02:08:12,640 --> 02:08:13,000
Look!

3767
02:08:13,040 --> 02:08:13,780
There he is!

3768
02:08:13,840 --> 02:08:14,100
Look!

3769
02:08:14,100 --> 02:08:14,680
There he is!

3770
02:08:15,620 --> 02:08:16,400
Oh, hello!

3771
02:08:16,900 --> 02:08:17,660
Oh my god!

3772
02:08:17,780 --> 02:08:18,740
Lion King!

3773
02:08:19,540 --> 02:08:20,960
It's like Lion King!

3774
02:08:20,960 --> 02:08:21,340
Lion King!

3775
02:08:21,340 --> 02:08:22,120
Get picked up!

3776
02:08:22,120 --> 02:08:23,060
Get picked up for content!

3777
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:24,520
Content!

3778
02:08:25,180 --> 02:08:26,440
Oh, good content!

3779
02:08:26,580 --> 02:08:27,000
Good content!

3780
02:08:27,380 --> 02:08:28,660
Oh, they're picking her up.

3781
02:08:28,740 --> 02:08:29,260
She's picking...

3782
02:08:29,260 --> 02:08:29,380
She...

3783
02:08:29,380 --> 02:08:30,420
Nachan's fucking dead.

3784
02:08:32,160 --> 02:08:33,840
Oh my god!

3785
02:08:34,760 --> 02:08:35,580
Okay, okay.

3786
02:08:35,580 --> 02:08:36,260
I need one.

3787
02:08:36,360 --> 02:08:37,200
I need one.

3788
02:08:37,420 --> 02:08:38,480
Holy shit.

3789
02:08:38,520 --> 02:08:39,060
Okay, okay.

3790
02:08:39,400 --> 02:08:39,920
Wait.

3791
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:40,280
Who am I?

3792
02:08:40,800 --> 02:08:41,320
Flamin'!

3793
02:08:41,320 --> 02:08:41,440
Flamin'!

3794
02:08:41,440 --> 02:08:43,000
Oh my god!

3795
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:43,540
I'm gonna die!

3796
02:08:45,060 --> 02:08:46,300
Oh my god!

3797
02:08:55,010 --> 02:08:55,770
Oh my god!

3798
02:08:55,770 --> 02:08:56,150
Oh my god!

3799
02:08:56,150 --> 02:08:56,270
Oh my god!

3800
02:08:56,290 --> 02:08:57,410
It's up to Hiro!

3801
02:08:57,690 --> 02:08:58,010
Help me!

3802
02:08:58,090 --> 02:08:58,470
Mokan!

3803
02:08:58,470 --> 02:08:59,270
It's up to Hiro!

3804
02:08:59,570 --> 02:09:00,570
Haku, me!

3805
02:09:01,050 --> 02:09:01,350
I have to natchen.

3806
02:09:01,350 --> 02:09:02,750
We don't have to natchen!

3807
02:09:02,870 --> 02:09:03,110
It's

3808
02:09:09,660 --> 02:09:09,680
up to me.

3809
02:09:09,740 --> 02:09:10,060
Leave!

3810
02:09:10,500 --> 02:09:11,380
Go, Garigaku!

3811
02:09:20,700 --> 02:09:21,740
They're dead.

3812
02:09:22,240 --> 02:09:23,340
Oh my god.

3813
02:09:23,720 --> 02:09:24,800
They're dead.

3814
02:09:24,800 --> 02:09:27,920
They don't have to hear you, the dead don't talk!

3815
02:09:28,860 --> 02:09:29,720
Haru, Haru, Haru!

3816
02:09:30,120 --> 02:09:31,260
Go, Horu, go, Horu, go!

3817
02:09:37,060 --> 02:09:38,720
Hanging each other.

3818
02:09:39,800 --> 02:09:40,600
Karaso Mom, hold him.

3819
02:09:40,600 --> 02:09:40,860
.

3820
02:09:40,860 --> 02:09:43,260
Everyone's dead.

3821
02:09:58,130 --> 02:10:03,010
I was waiting for a monster to come in and just hit them.

3822
02:10:05,170 --> 02:10:09,670
I got picked up.

3823
02:10:09,790 --> 02:10:11,190
I laughed at Nachan.

3824
02:10:11,190 --> 02:10:15,950
I laughed at Nachan getting picked up by the monster and then I got picked up.

3825
02:10:17,730 --> 02:10:22,970
And when you got picked up, they told... he told you to me.

3826
02:10:24,770 --> 02:10:27,710
I thought it was so funny and then I died.

3827
02:10:33,710 --> 02:10:35,610
Do we have enough film?

3828
02:10:35,690 --> 02:10:36,490
Because I can dance.

3829
02:10:37,150 --> 02:10:38,510
I can dance too.

3830
02:10:38,930 --> 02:10:39,930
Oh, no film.

3831
02:10:40,050 --> 02:10:40,250
Okay.

3832
02:10:42,630 --> 02:10:43,810
Alright, we need money.

3833
02:10:43,810 --> 02:10:44,810
We have zero views.

3834
02:10:45,010 --> 02:10:45,950
We need money.

3835
02:10:52,290 --> 02:10:52,990
She has it.

3836
02:10:53,070 --> 02:10:53,350
She has it.

3837
02:10:55,770 --> 02:10:56,190
Nice.

3838
02:10:58,630 --> 02:10:59,050
Nice.

3839
02:10:59,050 --> 02:10:59,810
We're doing it.

3840
02:11:01,890 --> 02:11:02,310
Nice.

3841
02:11:02,970 --> 02:11:02,970
Okay.

3842
02:11:08,670 --> 02:11:09,450
I got it.

3843
02:11:10,410 --> 02:11:10,990
Let's watch.

3844
02:11:12,330 --> 02:11:12,810
I'll first.

3845
02:11:14,310 --> 02:11:15,370
The first CD.

3846
02:11:15,670 --> 02:11:15,910
Okay.

3847
02:11:16,650 --> 02:11:17,570
Film, film, film.

3848
02:11:17,750 --> 02:11:17,950
Okay.

3849
02:11:18,910 --> 02:11:19,910
Look at this.

3850
02:11:20,030 --> 02:11:21,090
It's so beautiful.

3851
02:11:21,570 --> 02:11:21,790
Wow.

3852
02:11:21,790 --> 02:11:22,090
So beautiful.

3853
02:11:22,750 --> 02:11:24,690
This is one Akasupa.

3854
02:11:24,990 --> 02:11:28,010
If you want to watch this, it's one Akasupa.

3855
02:11:33,580 --> 02:11:35,680
This is Doggy Spawn.

3856
02:11:36,540 --> 02:11:37,980
What the f**k?

3857
02:11:40,590 --> 02:11:41,570
What the f**k?

3858
02:11:42,090 --> 02:11:42,870
What the f**k?

3859
02:11:43,350 --> 02:11:43,910
What the f**k?

3860
02:11:44,090 --> 02:11:44,390
What the f**k?

3861
02:11:44,650 --> 02:11:45,990
What the f**k?

3862
02:11:47,870 --> 02:11:48,610
What the f**k?

3863
02:11:48,630 --> 02:11:48,730
What the f**k?

3864
02:11:51,460 --> 02:11:51,980
Doggy, Doggy.

3865
02:11:52,020 --> 02:11:52,140
Doggy.

3866
02:11:52,140 --> 02:11:52,180
Doggy.

3867
02:11:52,180 --> 02:11:53,320
This is the second day, I think.

3868
02:11:53,380 --> 02:11:54,360
Yeah, this is today.

3869
02:11:54,480 --> 02:11:54,940
This is today.

3870
02:11:55,280 --> 02:11:57,960
I say, I say, wait for here.

3871
02:11:58,440 --> 02:11:58,880
Hello.

3872
02:11:59,080 --> 02:11:59,520

Oh my god.

3876
02:12:03,620 --> 02:12:04,500
35k views.

3877
02:12:04,900 --> 02:12:05,320
Oh my god.

3878
02:12:06,200 --> 02:12:07,460
Look at all the views.

3879
02:12:14,240 --> 02:12:15,140
Oh my god.

3880
02:12:15,540 --> 02:12:16,200
Oh my god.

3881
02:12:17,460 --> 02:12:18,180
Oh my god.

3882
02:12:18,540 --> 02:12:18,640
Oh my god.

3883
02:12:19,140 --> 02:12:20,260
I should dance.

3884
02:12:20,680 --> 02:12:20,860
I don't know.

3885
02:12:20,920 --> 02:12:21,380
I don't know.

3886
02:12:39,340 --> 02:12:40,600
Oh my god.

3887
02:12:41,520 --> 02:12:42,860
It's okay, we're still alive.

3888
02:12:43,140 --> 02:12:44,120
You don't have to cry anymore.

3889
02:12:45,700 --> 02:12:49,960
Oh my god, $400!

3890
02:12:51,340 --> 02:12:52,900
We got $400!

3891
02:12:52,900 --> 02:12:53,880
Whoa!

3892
02:12:55,440 --> 02:12:58,580
Okay, next one next.

3893
02:13:00,960 --> 02:13:01,760
Backflip!

3894
02:13:03,140 --> 02:13:03,940
Ooh!

3895
02:13:14,290 --> 02:13:15,210
What's this?

3896
02:13:15,370 --> 02:13:16,010
What is that?

3897
02:13:17,890 --> 02:13:19,730
Mojio is very clumsy.

3898
02:13:24,910 --> 02:13:25,710
Doggy!

3899
02:13:27,050 --> 02:13:28,050
This is me!

3900
02:13:30,610 --> 02:13:31,910
Everything is still me.

3901
02:13:31,950 --> 02:13:33,150
Everything is me.

3902
02:14:00,840 --> 02:14:02,560
Oh, is this where he died?

3903
02:14:02,840 --> 02:14:03,840
Is this where he died?

3904
02:14:05,840 --> 02:14:07,400
This is where he died.

3905
02:14:07,540 --> 02:14:10,460
Look at the view!

3906
02:14:11,660 --> 02:14:13,000
Look at that!

3907
02:14:13,300 --> 02:14:14,260
It's because Hiro died!

3908
02:14:14,260 --> 02:14:14,600
He died!

3909
02:14:16,180 --> 02:14:19,120
Hiro died so then we got so much views!

3910
02:14:24,400 --> 02:14:27,760
Oh my god, we're doing so well guys.

3911
02:14:27,920 --> 02:14:28,940
I always believed in us.

3912
02:14:29,500 --> 02:14:30,880
Now I'm happy again.

3913
02:14:35,120 --> 02:14:36,060
Look at that.

3914
02:14:36,080 --> 02:14:36,860
Now I'm happy.

3915
02:14:40,800 --> 02:14:41,320
Damn!

3916
02:14:44,260 --> 02:14:45,780
We're so fucking good at this.

3917
02:14:47,120 --> 02:14:49,480
Hiro died so the channel can live.

3918
02:14:52,400 --> 02:14:55,000
She died for our sins guys.

3919
02:14:55,940 --> 02:14:57,700
She died for our sins.

3920
02:15:00,720 --> 02:15:03,080
Now I'm happy now because we're making money.

3921
02:15:03,960 --> 02:15:05,840
Yeah, we have $1000!

3922
02:15:07,180 --> 02:15:08,200
Oh my god!

3923
02:15:08,540 --> 02:15:10,000
Guys, guys, guys, guys.

3924
02:15:10,120 --> 02:15:11,000
Guys, guys.

3925
02:15:11,540 --> 02:15:13,320
Emoto, Emoto, Emoto.

3926
02:15:18,840 --> 02:15:19,840
This is it.

3927
02:15:21,280 --> 02:15:22,220
This is it.

3928
02:15:22,280 --> 02:15:23,420
We saved for this.

3929
02:15:25,080 --> 02:15:27,340
Guys, this is it.

3930
02:15:27,460 --> 02:15:28,960
We saved for this emote.

3931
02:15:29,300 --> 02:15:31,140
And I think Nachan should have it.

3932
02:15:31,160 --> 02:15:32,120
Nachan, you should have this.

3933
02:15:33,080 --> 02:15:34,440
Wait, wait, Nachan, Nachan, Nachan.

3934

3955
02:16:21,700 --> 02:16:22,720
Should we get something else?

3956
02:16:23,520 --> 02:16:24,760
Do we need a flashlight?

3957
02:16:25,440 --> 02:16:27,760
I want a flashlight!

3958
02:16:28,240 --> 02:16:29,640

Do you want to try one long flashlight?

3961
02:16:33,580 --> 02:16:34,220
Yeah, we should try one.

3962
02:16:34,420 --> 02:16:35,460
Do we have enough?

3963
02:16:35,520 --> 02:16:36,000
We don't have enough.

3964
02:16:36,580 --> 02:16:38,440
We don't have enough for a long flashlight.

3965
02:16:39,720 --> 02:16:40,740
Oh wait, we do!

3966
02:16:40,900 --> 02:16:41,940
Oh, flash this one.

02:16:48,540 --> 02:16:49,340
Emergency only.

3971
02:16:50,180 --> 02:16:50,860
Flash.

3972
02:16:52,930 --> 02:16:54,290
Alright, did you buy the flashlight?

02:17:10,790 --> 02:17:11,530
She's so mean!

02:17:11,850 --> 02:17:13,410

3982
02:17:15,570 --> 02:17:16,850
Hiro, teach her.

02:17:17,070 --> 02:17:18,370
Hiro, teach her.

3984
02:17:18,370 --> 02:17:18,410
It's so long.

3985
02:17:22,610 --> 02:17:23,050
It's so long.

3986
02:17:23,390 --> 02:17:24,710

We already did it.

3991
02:17:31,090 --> 02:17:32,210
We already made money.

3992
02:17:32,490 --> 02:17:34,470

02:17:57,050 --> 02:17:57,570
Alright.

4008
02:17:59,030 --> 02:18:00,470
Oh, you recharged it.

4009
02:18:00,530 --> 02:18:00,730
Okay.

4010
02:18:01,810 --> 02:18:02,330
Alright.

4011
02:18:03,890 --> 02:18:05,450
I believe in your content.

4012
02:18:05,910 --> 02:18:06,950
Wait, where?

4013
02:18:10,850 --> 02:18:12,590
Oh, hey, there's already Torbjorn!

4014
02:18:13,790 --> 02:18:15,030
For an Akasupa!

4015
02:18:15,670 --> 02:18:17,430
Alright, so now this is...

4016
02:18:17,990 --> 02:18:19,870
This is two Akasupas now.

4017
02:18:20,590 --> 02:18:21,610
We're more famous.

4018
02:18:21,630 --> 02:18:22,710
So we can charge more.

4019
02:18:22,950 --> 02:18:23,970
So this is two Akasupas.

4020
02:18:24,830 --> 02:18:25,590
Oh, okay.

Okay.

4028
02:18:43,450 --> 02:18:44,210
Okay.

4029
02:18:44,210 --> 02:18:44,990
Down we go!

4030
02:18:45,570 --> 02:18:46,330
Wee!

4031
02:18:46,510 --> 02:18:47,190
Here we go!

4032
02:18:49,490 --> 02:18:50,250
Okay.

4033
02:18:50,950 --> 02:18:51,310
Alright.

4034
02:18:53,330 --> 02:18:54,930
We need to find new monsters!

4035
02:18:55,330 --> 02:18:56,370
Oh, there's a skull here!

4036
02:18:57,490 --> 02:18:58,210
A skull!

4037
02:18:58,930 --> 02:18:59,830
Yeah, skull.

4038
02:19:00,350 --> 02:19:00,570
Laser!

4039
02:19:01,710 --> 02:19:02,390
There's a laser?

4040
02:19:02,550 --> 02:19:03,770
Can we walk through it?

4041
02:19:04,290 --> 02:19:05,390
Oh, I don't think we can.

4042
02:19:05,550 --> 02:19:05,870
Wait, wait.

4043
02:19:05,950 --> 02:19:06,490
I think I can.

4044
02:19:06,610 --> 02:19:06,990
Watch this.

4045
02:19:07,510 --> 02:19:08,270
Guys, guys.

4046
02:19:09,450 --> 02:19:10,430
Watch this, guys.

4047
02:19:10,570 --> 02:19:10,990
Okay, wait.

4048
02:19:11,450 --> 02:19:12,490
Someone picked this up.

4049
02:19:12,630 --> 02:19:13,730
Okay, watch this, guys.

4050
02:19:14,210 --> 02:19:14,570
Watch.

4051
02:19:14,770 --> 02:19:15,870
Okay, film me, film me, film me.

4052
02:19:16,830 --> 02:19:17,190
Okay.

4053
02:19:17,190 --> 02:19:17,750
I'm not filming.

4054
02:19:17,970 --> 02:19:18,410
Filming?

4055
02:19:18,430 --> 02:19:18,750
Are you filming?

4056
02:19:18,970 --> 02:19:19,530
Okay.

4057
02:19:19,710 --> 02:19:20,390
Oh!

4058
02:19:25,470 --> 02:19:26,310
That's right.

4059
02:19:27,030 --> 02:19:27,710
Wow!

4060
02:19:30,850 --> 02:19:31,950
That's terrible.

4061
02:19:34,150 --> 02:19:35,970
I'm trying to get the punch back.

4062
02:19:37,790 --> 02:19:38,470
What?

4063
02:19:55,560 --> 02:19:56,640
She's stuck!

4064
02:19:58,200 --> 02:19:58,720
Oh, shit!

4065
02:19:58,920 --> 02:19:59,420
Oh!

4066
02:20:00,700 --> 02:20:01,380
What?

4067
02:20:01,380 --> 02:20:01,680
What?

4068
02:20:04,500 --> 02:20:04,980
Oh, no!

4069
02:20:06,200 --> 02:20:07,340
Oh, she's coming!

4070
02:20:07,480 --> 02:20:07,800
She's coming!

4071
02:20:08,180 --> 02:20:09,460
I only got the defense!

4072
02:20:09,780 --> 02:20:11,300
I think she has the hug, too!

4073
02:20:13,140 --> 02:20:14,240
No, no, no, no, no!

4074
02:20:14,280 --> 02:20:14,640
Okay.

4075
02:20:14,980 --> 02:20:15,600
We're fine.

4076
02:20:15,660 --> 02:20:15,940
We're fine.

4077
02:20:16,020 --> 02:20:16,540
Walk around.

4078
02:20:16,620 --> 02:20:16,940
Walk around.

4079
02:20:17,060 --> 02:20:18,220
Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk.

4080
02:20:18,700 --> 02:20:19,280
Oh, God.

4081
02:20:20,680 --> 02:20:21,920
Is she at the hug?

4082
02:20:22,120 --> 02:20:22,760
Oh, no, she didn't.

4083
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:24,800
Is she okay?

4084
02:20:24,860 --> 02:20:25,280
Are you okay?

4085
02:20:25,620 --> 02:20:26,480
Nacha, are you okay?

4086
02:20:26,820 --> 02:20:28,320
I got you!

4087
02:20:30,100 --> 02:20:30,720
You're okay!

4088
02:20:30,740 --> 02:20:31,080
You're okay!

4089
02:20:31,140 --> 02:20:31,540
You're okay!

4090
02:20:33,300 --> 02:20:34,280
I saved you!

4091
02:20:37,160 --> 02:20:38,040
You're okay!

4092
02:20:38,360 --> 02:20:39,060
You're okay!

4093
02:20:39,380 --> 02:20:39,540
You're okay!

4094
02:20:40,120 --> 02:20:40,740
You're okay!

4095
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:42,440
Okay.

4096
02:20:42,760 --> 02:20:43,000
Okay.

4097
02:20:43,420 --> 02:20:44,120
Where's Ditto?

4098
02:20:44,360 --> 02:20:45,240
Ditto, are you alive?

4099
02:20:48,280 --> 02:20:48,720
Okay.

4100
02:20:48,840 --> 02:20:49,880
We only have one revive.

4101
02:20:55,760 --> 02:20:56,200
Okay.

4102
02:20:56,500 --> 02:20:57,400
We did it.

4103
02:20:57,500 --> 02:20:57,940
Okay.

4104
02:20:58,480 --> 02:20:59,320
Let's go to...

4105
02:20:59,320 --> 02:21:00,440
I took the flame.

4106
02:21:00,640 --> 02:21:01,040
Yeah.

4107
02:21:01,120 --> 02:21:02,020
I flamed the dog.

4108
02:21:02,840 --> 02:21:03,280
Okay.

4109
02:21:03,340 --> 02:21:03,460
Okay.

4110
02:21:03,460 --> 02:21:03,760
Let's go.

4111
02:21:03,820 --> 02:21:04,660
Let's find the other...

4112
02:21:04,660 --> 02:21:05,880
There's another exit, right?

4113
02:21:05,960 --> 02:21:06,600
Another entrance.

4114
02:21:08,800 --> 02:21:10,020
Let's go to the other one.

4115
02:21:10,520 --> 02:21:11,900
He ero died for content.

4116
02:21:13,020 --> 02:21:15,000
She, she died for content.

4117
02:21:15,240 --> 02:21:15,860
Like you...

4118
02:21:15,860 --> 02:21:17,220
I tried to backflip over.

4119
02:21:17,300 --> 02:21:17,820
Yeah.

4120
02:21:21,420 --> 02:21:21,940
Try.

4121
02:21:22,280 --> 02:21:22,940
You tried.

4122
02:21:23,040 --> 02:21:23,500
Definitely.

4123
02:21:27,760 --> 02:21:30,360
Oh, oh, oh, slime.

4124
02:21:30,860 --> 02:21:31,380
Slime?

4125
02:21:31,560 --> 02:21:31,960
Slime?

4126
02:21:32,120 --> 02:21:33,580
He ero, he ero, he ero!

4127
02:21:33,580 --> 02:21:34,000
Yeah.

4128
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:35,480
Go to the slime, he ero.

4129
02:21:36,200 --> 02:21:37,680
Go to the slime, he ero.

4130
02:21:37,780 --> 02:21:38,060
Go!

4131
02:21:38,080 --> 02:21:38,300
Go!

4132
02:21:38,300 --> 02:21:38,300
Go!

4133
02:21:38,640 --> 02:21:40,300
Goodbye Hiro!

4134
02:21:41,220 --> 02:21:43,400
Goodbye Hiro!

4135
02:21:43,780 --> 02:21:45,760
Goodbye Hiro!

4136
02:21:46,980 --> 02:21:47,940
Goodbye!

4137
02:21:49,680 --> 02:21:52,060
Maybe she's still here.

4138
02:21:52,280 --> 02:21:54,500
Guys, I don't think Hiro's alive anymore.

4139
02:21:56,800 --> 02:21:58,240
Are we gonna leave?

4140
02:21:58,620 --> 02:21:59,360
Hiro?

4141
02:21:59,440 --> 02:22:02,360
Where is Hiro's body?

4142
02:22:04,080 --> 02:22:05,520
She got kidnapped.

4143
02:22:06,580 --> 02:22:07,980
Yeah, she got kidnapped.

4144
02:22:08,720 --> 02:22:09,420
Oh, Hiro!

4145
02:22:09,560 --> 02:22:10,260
Oh, there she is!

4146
02:22:11,480 --> 02:22:12,640
Oh my god!

4147
02:22:12,900 --> 02:22:13,740
What's your HP?

4148
02:22:16,120 --> 02:22:17,060
Oh my god!

4149
02:22:17,120 --> 02:22:17,760
She did it!

4150
02:22:17,980 --> 02:22:18,240
Hiro's alive!

4151
02:22:18,780 --> 02:22:21,240
We're gonna go back to our basement, guys.

4152
02:22:21,500 --> 02:22:23,500
We should see if there's a big monster.

4153
02:22:23,720 --> 02:22:25,320
I'm pretty sure a big monster might show up.

4154
02:22:27,320 --> 02:22:29,040
Let's go to the other entrance.

4155
02:22:29,640 --> 02:22:30,520
I'm not out of the frame.

4156
02:22:30,900 --> 02:22:31,840
Oh, where are you guys?

4157
02:22:31,840 --> 02:22:32,680
I'm not out of the frame.

4158
02:22:33,420 --> 02:22:34,340
I hear something.

4159
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:35,880
I hear the slime.

4160
02:22:36,120 --> 02:22:36,560
Hug?

4161
02:22:37,220 --> 02:22:38,200
Oh yeah, hug.

4162
02:22:38,260 --> 02:22:38,620
Hug.

4163
02:22:39,440 --> 02:22:40,320
Hug time.

4164
02:22:41,260 --> 02:22:42,960
I have 0% 0%?

4165
02:22:44,540 --> 02:22:45,300
Okay, okay.

4166
02:22:45,380 --> 02:22:46,180
Let's go home then.

4167
02:22:46,840 --> 02:22:47,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4168
02:22:47,720 --> 02:22:48,260
Home time.

4169
02:22:48,720 --> 02:22:49,580
Let's go home first.

4170
02:22:50,680 --> 02:22:51,400
Oh, goodbye.

4171
02:22:52,060 --> 02:22:53,520
Guys, I don't think...

4172
02:22:53,520 --> 02:22:55,400
Guys, Hiro got kidnapped.

4173
02:22:57,380 --> 02:22:58,140
Not Chad.

4174
02:22:58,180 --> 02:22:58,820
Where's Hiro?

4175
02:23:00,260 --> 02:23:00,780
Hiro?

4176
02:23:02,280 --> 02:23:03,420
Is Hiro dead?

4177
02:23:05,520 --> 02:23:05,700
Maybe.

4178
02:23:06,260 --> 02:23:07,280
Did she die?

4179
02:23:07,740 --> 02:23:09,480
I think maybe she should go back.

4180
02:23:09,580 --> 02:23:09,820
Oh!

4181
02:23:15,140 --> 02:23:16,760
I think Ditto's dead.

4182
02:23:18,040 --> 02:23:20,500
I think Ditto's dead.

4183
02:23:21,580 --> 02:23:22,060
Mine!

4184
02:23:22,200 --> 02:23:22,680
Mine!

4185
02:23:22,700 --> 02:23:22,980
Mine!

4186
02:23:22,980 --> 02:23:23,100
Mine!

4187
02:23:23,300 --> 02:23:23,680
Ditto?

4188
02:23:25,920 --> 02:23:26,400
Ditto?

4189
02:23:28,580 --> 02:23:29,060
Ditto?

4190
02:23:29,120 --> 02:23:29,680
Oh, Ditto's alive!

4191
02:23:29,760 --> 02:23:30,120
Ditto's alive!

4192
02:23:30,880 --> 02:23:32,040
There she is!

4193
02:23:32,060 --> 02:23:32,380
There she is!

4194
02:23:32,460 --> 02:23:33,080
Oh, Hiro's alive!

4195
02:23:39,500 --> 02:23:40,460
You need a hug?

4196
02:23:40,460 --> 02:23:41,860
I need a hug from my mentor.

4197
02:23:41,960 --> 02:23:42,260
Help.

4198
02:23:42,400 --> 02:23:42,880
Okay.

4199
02:23:43,640 --> 02:23:44,120
Okay.

4200
02:23:44,280 --> 02:23:45,000
I'll watch.

4201
02:23:45,560 --> 02:23:46,520
I'm gonna watch.

4202
02:23:47,260 --> 02:23:47,740
That's right!

4203
02:23:48,540 --> 02:23:49,500
That's crazy!

4204
02:23:50,120 --> 02:23:51,180
Alright, okay, Ki.

4205
02:23:51,200 --> 02:23:51,760
Let's go home.

4206
02:23:51,860 --> 02:23:52,380
Let's go home.

4207
02:23:52,560 --> 02:23:53,220
No one's dead!

4208
02:23:53,500 --> 02:23:54,580
Hiro's still alive!

4209
02:23:55,660 --> 02:23:56,740
She's still alive!

4210
02:23:58,000 --> 02:23:59,120
She did it!

4211
02:23:59,280 --> 02:24:00,720
I always believed in you, Hiro.

4212
02:24:00,820 --> 02:24:02,000
I knew you would never die.

4213
02:24:03,660 --> 02:24:04,640
Dengue bug dying!

4214
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,240
Yeah, Hiro never... Hiro's never die.

4215
02:24:10,260 --> 02:24:11,120
Hiro's never die!

4216
02:24:11,140 --> 02:24:12,280
Hiro's never die!

4217
02:24:12,280 --> 02:24:13,300
Hiro's never die!

4218
02:24:16,020 --> 02:24:17,420
Yes, yes, Ditto.

4219
02:24:17,460 --> 02:24:19,420
Overwatch 2 is gonna be free soon.

4220
02:24:28,300 --> 02:24:29,660
What an end.

4221
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:30,860
What an end.

4222
02:24:31,160 --> 02:24:32,420
We should have recorded that.

4223
02:24:32,480 --> 02:24:34,080
That was such a good line to end on.

4224
02:24:36,620 --> 02:24:38,260
Are we gonna stay the video?

4225
02:24:38,600 --> 02:24:39,500
We should sack it.

4226
02:24:39,540 --> 02:24:41,000
We have so much... so many views.

4227
02:24:41,620 --> 02:24:42,600
Sack it, sack it.

4228
02:24:42,780 --> 02:24:42,980
Oh yeah!

4229
02:24:43,120 --> 02:24:43,320
Alright.

4230
02:24:43,680 --> 02:24:45,600
We end this collab when we die.

4231
02:24:46,100 --> 02:24:46,620
Okay?

4232
02:24:47,780 --> 02:24:48,660
When we all die?

4233
02:24:48,740 --> 02:24:49,580
When we all die.

4234
02:24:49,800 --> 02:24:54,020
We end... When we lose our channel, we all end collab.

4235
02:24:54,740 --> 02:24:55,480
Okay, okay.

4236
02:24:55,540 --> 02:24:56,020
Yeah, yeah.

4237
02:24:56,020 --> 02:24:59,460
This collab doesn't stop until our channel dies.

4238
02:25:00,660 --> 02:25:02,060
Just like real streaming.

4239
02:25:05,160 --> 02:25:06,200
Real streaming.

4240
02:25:06,240 --> 02:25:06,920
Real streaming.

4241
02:25:07,100 --> 02:25:07,660
Okay, okay, okay.

4242
02:25:08,860 --> 02:25:09,680
Good night.

4243
02:25:10,280 --> 02:25:10,980
Good night.

4244
02:25:11,380 --> 02:25:11,660
Good night.

4245
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:13,040
Good night everybody.

4246
02:25:15,020 --> 02:25:15,800
So fast.

4247
02:25:16,140 --> 02:25:17,000
Oh my god.

4248
02:25:19,140 --> 02:25:19,540
325k.

4249
02:25:20,280 --> 02:25:21,300
Oh my god.

4250
02:25:21,320 --> 02:25:21,860
That's a lot.

4251
02:25:22,160 --> 02:25:22,480
We can watch it now, right?

4252
02:25:22,860 --> 02:25:23,480
Yeah, we could.

4253
02:25:23,980 --> 02:25:24,580
I don't know.

4254
02:25:24,640 --> 02:25:26,980
I think we should film the next one and then watch it.

4255
02:25:27,880 --> 02:25:28,520
Okay, okay.

4256
02:25:28,620 --> 02:25:29,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4257
02:25:29,200 --> 02:25:29,520
Let's go.

4258
02:25:29,720 --> 02:25:30,240
We can watch it now.

4259
02:25:30,700 --> 02:25:31,680
Yeah, watch it later.

4260
02:25:32,680 --> 02:25:35,840
I feel like we should watch it later and then watch both of them at the same time.

4261
02:25:39,640 --> 02:25:40,040
Alright.

4262
02:25:40,040 --> 02:25:40,160
Alright.

4263
02:25:40,200 --> 02:25:41,300
No money time.

4264
02:25:42,140 --> 02:25:42,800
Wait, what's this?

4265
02:25:43,140 --> 02:25:43,820
No money.

4266
02:25:44,100 --> 02:25:46,520
Oh, it's the old party poppy.

4267
02:25:46,880 --> 02:25:48,880
I'm gonna buy one old flashlight.

4268
02:25:49,280 --> 02:25:52,180
Okay, I'm gonna buy... I'm gonna buy this too.

4269
02:25:53,200 --> 02:25:54,360
No money.

4270
02:25:55,860 --> 02:25:57,260
My order too.

4271
02:25:59,000 --> 02:25:59,680
Money order.

4272
02:26:00,860 --> 02:26:01,880
Party poppy.

4273
02:26:03,260 --> 02:26:05,580
Whenever somebody dies, I'll pop this.

4274
02:26:06,180 --> 02:26:06,840
Okay.

4275
02:26:06,880 --> 02:26:07,440
Okay.

4276
02:26:07,440 --> 02:26:07,780
I'm looking.

4277
02:26:09,080 --> 02:26:10,820
Can I die from this?

4278
02:26:11,260 --> 02:26:12,260
Guys, guys, guys!

4279
02:26:12,340 --> 02:26:12,500
Whoa!

4280
02:26:13,400 --> 02:26:13,780
Whoa!

4281
02:26:14,240 --> 02:26:14,500
What?

4282
02:26:14,580 --> 02:26:15,460
Guys, guys, guys!

4283
02:26:15,620 --> 02:26:16,100
Someone!

4284
02:26:16,700 --> 02:26:17,180
Someone!

4285
02:26:17,640 --> 02:26:18,120
Guys!

4286
02:26:18,220 --> 02:26:18,900
No, no, no!

4287
02:26:18,920 --> 02:26:20,480
No, no, no!

4288
02:26:20,560 --> 02:26:20,940
No, no,

4289
02:26:24,470 --> 02:26:24,470
no!

4290
02:26:24,690 --> 02:26:26,090
Oh, I live though.

4291
02:26:26,350 --> 02:26:26,930
You're laughing!

4292
02:26:27,610 --> 02:26:28,550
You're laughing!

4293
02:26:30,690 --> 02:26:31,170
Why?

4294
02:26:32,050 --> 02:26:32,530
Why?

4295
02:26:32,990 --> 02:26:33,470
Why?

4296
02:26:33,950 --> 02:26:34,430
Why?

4297
02:26:35,370 --> 02:26:35,850
Why?

4298
02:26:35,950 --> 02:26:36,170
Why?

4299
02:26:36,170 --> 02:26:36,270
Why?

4300
02:26:36,270 --> 02:26:36,470
Why?

4301
02:26:36,570 --> 02:26:36,810
Why?

4302
02:26:36,810 --> 02:26:36,950
Why?

4303
02:26:38,270 --> 02:26:39,830
I have this though.

4304
02:26:40,110 --> 02:26:40,550
What?

4305
02:26:42,610 --> 02:26:44,230
Did you film the...

4306
02:26:44,230 --> 02:26:44,970
Oh my god.

4307
02:26:45,030 --> 02:26:46,390
Did you film it?

4308
02:26:47,070 --> 02:26:48,690
I think she filmed you.

4309
02:26:48,730 --> 02:26:49,970
Did you at least film it?

4310
02:26:51,990 --> 02:26:52,890
But I lived!

4311
02:26:53,070 --> 02:26:54,550
I lived though.

4312
02:26:54,810 --> 02:26:56,610
Aren't you all happy that I lived?

4313
02:26:57,630 --> 02:26:57,790
Damn.

4314
02:26:58,470 --> 02:26:59,430
We can't...

4315
02:26:59,770 --> 02:27:01,650
We can't live like this.

4316
02:27:01,790 --> 02:27:02,070
We have money.

4317
02:27:02,210 --> 02:27:04,050
We have our $300 revolver.

4318
02:27:04,050 --> 02:27:04,350
We have $300.

4319
02:27:04,350 --> 02:27:05,330
Don't you guys...

4320
02:27:06,250 --> 02:27:07,570
Guys, but I'm alive!

4321
02:27:08,190 --> 02:27:09,790
Guys, I'm alive too!

4322
02:27:14,650 --> 02:27:15,050
Nice.

4323
02:27:17,710 --> 02:27:19,050
Wait, is there any holes here?

4324
02:27:19,510 --> 02:27:20,210
No holes.

4325
02:27:21,530 --> 02:27:22,790
Oh, head, head, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4326
02:27:23,670 --> 02:27:28,570
Guys, I can't... woah, this makes it scarier.

4327
02:27:30,530 --> 02:27:32,270
I can't turn this off, by the way.

4328
02:27:33,050 --> 02:27:35,290
Guys, I can't turn this off, so we're gonna use it forever.

4329
02:27:37,670 --> 02:27:38,870
Wait, why is there light?

4330
02:27:38,990 --> 02:27:39,710
Did you guys see that?

4331
02:27:40,070 --> 02:27:41,430
There was a light over there.

4332
02:27:43,410 --> 02:27:43,850
Yeah.

4333
02:27:43,850 --> 02:27:44,530
Over here.

4334
02:27:45,210 --> 02:27:46,310
Oh, it's the bar.

4335
02:27:48,190 --> 02:27:48,630
Run!

4336
02:27:57,040 --> 02:27:58,400
The ants are killed!

4337
02:28:01,210 --> 02:28:01,650
Wait.

4338
02:28:02,670 --> 02:28:03,110
Yeah?

4339
02:28:04,770 --> 02:28:05,730
Did you film it?

4340
02:28:06,170 --> 02:28:08,170
Wait, wait, wait, wait, it's the half camera.

4341
02:28:08,390 --> 02:28:09,250
Wait, you don't have the camera?

4342
02:28:10,350 --> 02:28:10,790
Yeah.

4343
02:28:10,910 --> 02:28:11,730
Wait, who is it?

4344
02:28:12,110 --> 02:28:12,590
Who got the camera?

4345
02:28:14,490 --> 02:28:15,730
Maybe here or not.

4346
02:28:15,890 --> 02:28:19,330
Okay, okay, I'm gonna go downstairs and I'm gonna try and get it.

4347
02:28:22,450 --> 02:28:22,850
What?

4348
02:28:24,550 --> 02:28:25,510
Can you hear me?

4349
02:28:25,530 --> 02:28:26,170
I don't have ears!

4350
02:28:26,410 --> 02:28:27,070
I don't have ears!

4351
02:28:27,610 --> 02:28:28,210
I have ears!

4352
02:28:28,350 --> 02:28:28,830
I have ears!

4353
02:28:29,110 --> 02:28:30,150
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

4354
02:28:30,990 --> 02:28:31,390
Okay.

4355
02:28:32,950 --> 02:28:34,810
We're gonna get one punch.

4356
02:28:35,090 --> 02:28:35,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4357
02:28:36,310 --> 02:28:38,090
We're still gonna die regardless!

4358
02:28:39,550 --> 02:28:40,550
Are you at full HP?

4359
02:28:42,110 --> 02:28:42,610
Not yet.

4360
02:28:43,370 --> 02:28:43,850
Okay, full.

4361
02:28:44,030 --> 02:28:44,970
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

4362
02:28:45,010 --> 02:28:46,010
I'm gonna grab the camera.

4363
02:28:47,210 --> 02:28:48,050
Remember, Dino, remember.

4364
02:28:48,190 --> 02:28:49,290
Okay, my flare ran out.

4365
02:28:49,350 --> 02:28:50,330
Remember me, Dino!

4366
02:28:52,390 --> 02:28:52,990
Remember me!

4367
02:28:55,390 --> 02:28:55,990
First camera.

4368
02:28:56,310 --> 02:28:57,510
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.

4369
02:28:57,590 --> 02:28:58,370
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

4370
02:28:58,450 --> 02:28:59,110
Film this, film this.

4371
02:28:59,310 --> 02:29:00,370
Dino, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4372
02:29:00,370 --> 02:29:00,870
Film this.

4373
02:29:02,470 --> 02:29:02,990
Wait, wait, no.

4374
02:29:03,130 --> 02:29:03,490
Which one?

4375
02:29:03,610 --> 02:29:04,690
First camera, first camera.

4376
02:29:05,130 --> 02:29:06,310
Where did I throw the other thing?

4377
02:29:07,530 --> 02:29:09,490
Wait, did you take the other thing I got?

4378
02:29:11,050 --> 02:29:11,710
Okay, okay.

4379
02:29:11,890 --> 02:29:12,570
I'm filming.

4380
02:29:12,570 --> 02:29:14,030
Oh, film me, film me, film me, film me, film me.

4381
02:29:15,430 --> 02:29:16,070
Are you filming?

4382
02:29:17,070 --> 02:29:17,450
Okay.

4383
02:29:17,450 --> 02:29:17,450
Yeah.

4384
02:29:19,350 --> 02:29:20,050
Okay, let's go.

4385
02:29:23,930 --> 02:29:26,430
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

4386
02:29:26,750 --> 02:29:29,430
Alright, we don't have, we don't have a rewind.

4387
02:29:29,590 --> 02:29:30,650
No, we don't!

4388
02:29:31,670 --> 02:29:32,710
No, I don't.

4389
02:29:33,250 --> 02:29:34,330
We gotta go.

4390
02:29:35,030 --> 02:29:35,330
Guys.

4391
02:29:36,010 --> 02:29:36,390
Okay.

4392
02:29:36,870 --> 02:29:38,030
Why, why, that's two.

4393
02:29:38,210 --> 02:29:38,950
Why, that's not two.

4394
02:29:39,850 --> 02:29:40,250
Okay.

4395
02:29:40,710 --> 02:29:42,130
How much more film?

4396
02:29:42,450 --> 02:29:44,090
Wait, how much film do we have left?

4397
02:29:44,490 --> 02:29:44,890
Dino.

4398
02:29:45,210 --> 02:29:45,910
Um, 63.

4399
02:29:46,350 --> 02:29:47,750
Okay, stay here, stay here.

4400
02:29:48,010 --> 02:29:48,610
Okay, listen.

4401
02:29:48,970 --> 02:29:50,130
Stay here and we film.

4402
02:29:50,270 --> 02:29:50,910
We film.

4403
02:29:51,070 --> 02:29:51,470
Okay?

4404
02:29:51,870 --> 02:29:52,830
Okay, film.

4405
02:29:53,250 --> 02:29:53,830
Okay, okay.

4406
02:29:54,190 --> 02:29:54,870
Hello, guys.

4407
02:29:55,570 --> 02:29:57,390
Um, we lost two people.

4408
02:29:57,830 --> 02:29:59,290
But it was so cool, though.

4409
02:29:59,350 --> 02:30:00,150
It was so funny.

4410
02:30:01,290 --> 02:30:02,830
Okay, stop the film.

4411
02:30:02,910 --> 02:30:03,750
I got an idea, I got an idea.

4412
02:30:03,950 --> 02:30:04,590
I got an idea.

4413
02:30:04,630 --> 02:30:05,130
Stop the film.

4414
02:30:05,590 --> 02:30:06,270
Okay, okay, okay.

4415
02:30:06,310 --> 02:30:07,050
I'm gonna do something stupid.

4416
02:30:07,310 --> 02:30:08,190
Okay, watch this.

4417
02:30:08,190 --> 02:30:09,290
Okay, stay in here.

4418
02:30:09,350 --> 02:30:09,810
Stay in here.

4419
02:30:10,150 --> 02:30:10,470
Okay?

4420
02:30:10,950 --> 02:30:11,590
Stay in here.

4421
02:30:12,050 --> 02:30:12,550
Uh-huh.

4422
02:30:12,590 --> 02:30:12,730
Alright.

4423
02:30:12,850 --> 02:30:14,030
Okay, this flashlight is more expensive.

4424
02:30:14,210 --> 02:30:15,350
I'm gonna keep, I'm gonna keep this.

4425
02:30:15,470 --> 02:30:15,650
Okay.

4426
02:30:16,330 --> 02:30:16,650
Wait.

4427
02:30:16,790 --> 02:30:17,990
Let me throw away the...

4428
02:30:17,990 --> 02:30:18,650
Okay, there.

4429
02:30:18,930 --> 02:30:19,670
Alright, stay in here.

4430
02:30:20,090 --> 02:30:21,150
I'm gonna bring them to me.

4431
02:30:21,930 --> 02:30:23,290
Okay, I'm gonna bring them to me.

4432
02:30:23,330 --> 02:30:23,930
Close the door.

4433
02:30:23,970 --> 02:30:25,710
When I say close the door, close the door.

4434
02:30:27,070 --> 02:30:27,390
Okay.

4435
02:30:27,570 --> 02:30:28,490
I'm gonna be a hero.

4436
02:30:28,930 --> 02:30:30,190
I'm gonna be a hero for content.

4437
02:30:31,410 --> 02:30:32,530
I'm so good at content.

4438
02:30:33,590 --> 02:30:34,790
Okay, he was right here.

4439
02:30:35,910 --> 02:30:36,550
There's no...

4440
02:30:41,430 --> 02:30:41,750
Okay, I'm gonna go back.

4441
02:30:42,550 --> 02:30:43,170
Does anyone know where he is?

4442
02:30:43,450 --> 02:30:44,910
Is he coming over?

4443
02:30:46,410 --> 02:30:46,970
Is he?

4444
02:30:49,690 --> 02:30:50,490
Is that him?

4445
02:30:51,790 --> 02:30:51,930
Oh!

4446
02:30:52,030 --> 02:30:52,330
Oh!

4447
02:30:53,210 --> 02:30:54,030
Open it!

4448
02:30:54,050 --> 02:30:54,510
Open it up!

4449
02:30:54,650 --> 02:30:55,250
Open it up!

4450
02:30:55,350 --> 02:30:55,870
Open it up!

4451
02:31:06,130 --> 02:31:06,730
Open it!

4452
02:31:08,250 --> 02:31:08,730
Found!

4453
02:31:09,110 --> 02:31:09,450

4454

Oh my god!

4463
02:31:33,910 --> 02:31:34,750
Oh my god!

4464
02:31:34,990 --> 02:31:35,890
Oh my god!

4465
02:31:35,890 --> 02:31:36,210
Oh my god!

4466
02:31:36,310 --> 02:31:36,630
Oh my god!

4467
02:31:36,630 --> 02:31:36,650
Oh my god!

4468
02:31:36,650 --> 02:31:37,730
What are you doing?

4469
02:31:37,870 --> 02:31:39,950
Why did you run at it?

4470
02:31:45,470 --> 02:31:46,110
Mommy!

4471
02:31:46,550 --> 02:31:48,390
We got the content!

4472
02:31:48,430 --> 02:31:49,690
We got it!

4473
02:31:52,610 --> 02:31:54,850
He punched you!

4474
02:31:55,870 --> 02:31:57,610
And you just died!

4475
02:31:58,730 --> 02:32:00,250
Oh my god!

4476
02:32:00,250 --> 02:32:01,270
That's so scary!

4477
02:32:01,670 --> 02:32:02,950
That was so scary!

4478
02:32:06,530 --> 02:32:07,950
Oh wait, we don't have the...

4479
02:32:07,950 --> 02:32:09,910
Oh my god!

4480
02:32:10,090 --> 02:32:11,350
That was so scary!

4481
02:32:13,030 --> 02:32:14,070
We're gonna pay you!

4482
02:32:14,490 --> 02:32:15,410
Alright, here we go.

4483
02:32:18,150 --> 02:32:19,110
Thank you!

4484
02:32:19,290 --> 02:32:20,010
Thank you!

4485
02:32:20,210 --> 02:32:21,190
Oh, it's this one?

4486
02:32:23,310 --> 02:32:23,790
Yeah.

4487
02:32:24,630 --> 02:32:25,110
E.

4488
02:32:25,270 --> 02:32:25,690
T.

4489
02:32:25,790 --> 02:32:25,890
T.

4490
02:32:25,910 --> 02:32:26,030
T.

4491
02:32:26,030 --> 02:32:26,210
T.

4492
02:32:26,250 --> 02:32:26,690
T.

4493
02:32:30,250 --> 02:32:30,770
Who are you?

4494
02:32:30,990 --> 02:32:32,150
What the fuck?

4495
02:32:32,410 --> 02:32:36,110
What a lovely gesture!

4496
02:32:37,430 --> 02:32:38,950
Oh wait, there's already Chorby!

4497
02:32:40,570 --> 02:32:41,610
One Akasupa!

4498
02:32:43,250 --> 02:32:43,770
Akasupa!

4499
02:32:44,570 --> 02:32:46,390
This is two Akasupas now.

4500
02:32:47,130 --> 02:32:48,150
We're more famous.

4501
02:32:48,230 --> 02:32:49,250
So we can charge more.

4502
02:32:49,450 --> 02:32:50,930
This is two Akasupas.

4503
02:32:53,810 --> 02:32:54,810
Yes, go.

4504
02:32:55,630 --> 02:32:56,990
Guys, watch.

4505
02:32:57,270 --> 02:32:58,310
Okay, film me, film me, film me.

4506
02:32:58,350 --> 02:32:58,790
Film me.

4507
02:32:59,590 --> 02:33:01,030
Are you filming?

4508
02:33:01,250 --> 02:33:01,710
Yeah.

4509
02:33:02,290 --> 02:33:02,490
Woah!

4510
02:33:04,030 --> 02:33:04,790
Woah!

4511
02:33:05,970 --> 02:33:06,730
Yes!

4512
02:33:09,250 --> 02:33:09,590
What?

4513
02:33:10,990 --> 02:33:11,050
What?

4514
02:33:11,330 --> 02:33:11,770
What?

4515
02:33:11,930 --> 02:33:12,750
What?

4516
02:33:13,670 --> 02:33:14,110
What?

4517
02:33:18,490 --> 02:33:20,050
Good job, Hiro.

4518
02:33:20,390 --> 02:33:26,570
Oh my god, 76, 77 views!

4519
02:33:26,990 --> 02:33:27,810
79!

4520
02:33:27,810 --> 02:33:28,670
It's going higher!

4521
02:33:29,890 --> 02:33:30,730
Okay, okay!

4522
02:33:30,970 --> 02:33:31,630
Okay!

4523
02:33:32,290 --> 02:33:33,190
Go, go, go!

4524
02:33:33,970 --> 02:33:35,170
Goodbye, Hiro.

4525
02:33:36,950 --> 02:33:38,070
Goodbye, Hiro.

4526
02:33:38,070 --> 02:33:38,830
Goodbye, Hiro.

4527
02:33:39,090 --> 02:33:40,050
It's a H T!

4528
02:33:40,870 --> 02:33:41,710
She did it!

4529
02:33:41,710 --> 02:33:42,230
Hiro is still alive!

4530
02:33:42,510 --> 02:33:46,650
We're the best JoJo basemates, guys.

4531
02:33:48,110 --> 02:33:48,670
Nice.

4532
02:33:48,870 --> 02:33:49,370
90!

4533
02:33:49,670 --> 02:33:51,170
You got 90 views!

4534
02:33:53,390 --> 02:33:54,830
Okay, the next one.

4535
02:33:55,330 --> 02:33:55,890
Okay.

4536
02:33:56,210 --> 02:33:58,130
Alright, I think this one will be pretty good.

4537
02:33:58,130 --> 02:33:59,390
If somebody dies, I'll pop this.

4538
02:33:59,390 --> 02:33:59,590
Oh my god!

4539
02:34:00,370 --> 02:34:01,890
I'm the king!

4540
02:34:17,230 --> 02:34:17,610
Yay.

4541
02:34:17,750 --> 02:34:18,710
There was a light over there.

4542
02:34:19,790 --> 02:34:20,770
What you think I got?

4543
02:34:21,610 --> 02:34:22,250
Okay, okay.

4544
02:34:22,430 --> 02:34:23,230
I'm filming.

4545
02:34:23,670 --> 02:34:25,330
Film me, film me, film me, film me.

4546
02:34:26,690 --> 02:34:27,370
Are you filming?

4547
02:34:32,350 --> 02:34:33,890
We lost two people.

4548
02:34:34,330 --> 02:34:35,730
But it was so cool though.

4549
02:34:35,870 --> 02:34:36,610
It was so funny.

4550
02:34:38,170 --> 02:34:39,290
Okay, stop the film.

4551
02:34:39,370 --> 02:34:39,790
I got an idea.

4552
02:34:39,790 --> 02:34:40,230
I got an idea.

4553
02:34:41,310 --> 02:34:42,690
Alright, okay.

4554
02:34:42,790 --> 02:34:43,670
This flashlight is more expensive.

4555
02:34:43,830 --> 02:34:44,750
I'm gonna keep this.

4556
02:34:44,990 --> 02:34:45,190
Okay.

4557
02:34:45,850 --> 02:34:47,410
Wait, let me throw away the...

4558
02:34:47,410 --> 02:34:48,090
Okay, there.

4559
02:34:48,330 --> 02:34:48,970
Alright, stay here.

4560
02:34:49,450 --> 02:34:50,450
I'm gonna bring them to me.

4561
02:34:51,250 --> 02:34:52,510
Okay, I'm gonna bring them to me.

4562
02:34:52,610 --> 02:34:53,130
Close the door.

4563
02:34:53,150 --> 02:34:54,010
Why do I have to close the door?

4564
02:34:54,010 --> 02:34:54,290
Okay.

4565
02:35:01,720 --> 02:35:02,040
What?

4566
02:35:20,120 --> 02:35:21,040
Oh my god!

4567
02:35:21,160 --> 02:35:22,640
Wait, that's all you got?

4568
02:35:23,660 --> 02:35:25,120
That's all you got?

4569
02:35:25,240 --> 02:35:26,380
I'm the monster?

4570
02:35:27,980 --> 02:35:28,940
I don't know.

4571
02:35:29,040 --> 02:35:31,020
I have to run away.

4572
02:35:31,960 --> 02:35:33,800
I have to run away.

4573
02:35:34,060 --> 02:35:34,980
What the f***?

4574
02:35:35,020 --> 02:35:35,900
I have to run away.

4575
02:35:36,440 --> 02:35:39,160
Film me!

4576
02:35:39,800 --> 02:35:40,960
I'm flaming.

4577
02:35:42,220 --> 02:35:42,820
I'm flaming.

4578
02:35:43,660 --> 02:35:45,260
Oh my god.

4579
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:47,820
That's all you got.

4580
02:35:50,080 --> 02:35:51,620
Oh my god.

4581
02:35:55,200 --> 02:35:57,440
I have to leave now.

4582
02:35:58,260 --> 02:35:59,740
What the f***?

4583
02:35:59,880 --> 02:36:00,740
We did it.

4584
02:36:01,800 --> 02:36:04,640
Come on, film her.

4585
02:36:06,140 --> 02:36:07,180
Okay, Nachan.

4586
02:36:07,360 --> 02:36:08,820
Yeah, Nachan, you be the film.

4587
02:36:08,900 --> 02:36:09,500
Okay, we got it.

4588
02:36:09,560 --> 02:36:10,640
Let's buy the deep river.

4589
02:36:10,920 --> 02:36:11,440
Wait, we need the revive.

4590
02:36:11,620 --> 02:36:13,700
Yeah, we need the revive.

4591
02:36:14,080 --> 02:36:14,840
Okay, okay, okay.

4592
02:36:16,160 --> 02:36:17,740
Don't worry, I got the revive.

4593
02:36:19,140 --> 02:36:20,360
Nachan, you need to get this.

4594
02:36:21,280 --> 02:36:22,160
You have to destroy it.

4595
02:36:22,900 --> 02:36:23,780
Okay, okay, okay.

4596
02:36:24,020 --> 02:36:25,460
I can't believe it.

4597
02:36:25,480 --> 02:36:28,160
I got one second of content from that.

4598
02:36:28,220 --> 02:36:29,400
I can't believe it did it.

4599
02:36:31,720 --> 02:36:33,700
Ditto, Ditto screamed at the end.

4600
02:36:34,700 --> 02:36:39,520
I led the f***ing guy over and Ditto only filled one second.

4601
02:36:39,880 --> 02:36:41,780
I can't believe it, Ditto.

4602
02:36:41,840 --> 02:36:44,540
I risked my life for that guy.

4603
02:36:45,200 --> 02:36:45,840
No!

4604
02:36:46,240 --> 02:36:47,640
We closed the door.

4605
02:36:48,720 --> 02:36:51,240
No, no, no.

4606
02:36:51,240 --> 02:36:52,540
It's not my fault.

4607
02:36:52,740 --> 02:36:53,400
It's not my fault.

4608
02:36:53,460 --> 02:36:54,920
You closed the door.

4609
02:36:55,120 --> 02:36:56,240
You closed the door.

4610
02:36:56,260 --> 02:36:56,980
We would have...

4611
02:36:56,980 --> 02:36:57,340
Whoa!

4612
02:36:58,280 --> 02:36:58,920
Whoa!

4613
02:36:58,940 --> 02:36:59,520
We closed the door.

4614
02:36:59,540 --> 02:37:01,000
What is this?

4615
02:37:02,300 --> 02:37:03,600
Oh, this is scary.

4616
02:37:05,360 --> 02:37:06,960
I've never seen this before.

4617
02:37:08,660 --> 02:37:10,940
Maybe this is new?

4618
02:37:11,240 --> 02:37:12,760
Yeah, this has to be new, right?

4619
02:37:14,080 --> 02:37:14,660
No, no, no.

4620
02:37:14,960 --> 02:37:15,880
It's in the middle.

4621
02:37:16,200 --> 02:37:18,320
Oh, it's over here.

4622
02:37:19,740 --> 02:37:20,220
Oh.

4623
02:37:21,820 --> 02:37:22,440
Let's do it.

4624
02:37:22,560 --> 02:37:23,240
I'm not scared.

4625
02:37:24,020 --> 02:37:25,540
This is for the...

4626
02:37:26,320 --> 02:37:26,500
Woo!

4627
02:37:27,780 --> 02:37:28,980
Oh, it's the baker.

4628
02:37:29,100 --> 02:37:29,520
It's the baker.

4629
02:37:30,420 --> 02:37:31,160
It's the baker.

4630
02:37:32,800 --> 02:37:34,120
Film it, film it, film it.

4631
02:37:34,960 --> 02:37:36,060
Guys, guys, guys, watch out.

4632
02:37:37,520 --> 02:37:38,600
Guys, guys, guys.

4633
02:37:38,660 --> 02:37:39,500
I might be dead.

4634
02:37:40,660 --> 02:37:41,460
Guys, okay.

4635
02:37:41,900 --> 02:37:42,460
Okay, okay.

4636
02:37:42,540 --> 02:37:42,820
Watch.

4637
02:37:43,080 --> 02:37:44,880
Guys, I can't get to you.

4638
02:37:44,940 --> 02:37:45,740
I need hugs, guys.

4639
02:37:45,840 --> 02:37:46,420
I need hugs.

4640
02:37:46,660 --> 02:37:47,640
I need hugs.

4641
02:37:51,340 --> 02:37:52,400
Oh my god.

4642
02:37:52,640 --> 02:37:53,920
What the f***?

4643
02:37:55,940 --> 02:37:56,480
Hug me.

4644
02:37:56,600 --> 02:37:57,080
Hug me.

4645
02:37:57,180 --> 02:37:57,660
Hug me.

4646
02:37:57,780 --> 02:37:58,280
Hug me.

4647
02:37:58,300 --> 02:37:58,800
Hug me.

4648
02:37:58,800 --> 02:37:59,060
Hug me.

4649
02:37:59,080 --> 02:38:00,360
Okay, okay.

4650
02:38:00,640 --> 02:38:01,780
Hug all of us.

4651
02:38:01,820 --> 02:38:02,520
Hug all of us.

4652
02:38:02,900 --> 02:38:03,300
Wait,

4653
02:38:09,090 --> 02:38:09,770
is Hiro dead?

4654
02:38:11,270 --> 02:38:12,190
Oh my god.

4655
02:38:20,620 --> 02:38:21,860
Hiro, ball, shit.

4656
02:38:22,560 --> 02:38:22,960
Hiro, ball, shit.

4657
02:38:22,960 --> 02:38:23,220
Hiro, ball, shit.

4658
02:38:23,480 --> 02:38:24,240
Oh my god.

4659
02:38:24,580 --> 02:38:27,560
Last one, last one.

4660
02:38:28,440 --> 02:38:29,060
Eh, eh, dammit.

4661
02:38:29,300 --> 02:38:30,640
Hug me, hug me, hug me.

4662
02:38:30,840 --> 02:38:31,940
I can't hug me.

4663
02:38:33,480 --> 02:38:34,160
I can't hug you.

4664
02:38:35,440 --> 02:38:37,000
I have it, I have it, I have it.

4665
02:38:37,120 --> 02:38:37,960
Hug, hug, hug, hug.

4666
02:38:38,160 --> 02:38:38,860
Oh my god.

4667
02:38:39,020 --> 02:38:39,980
We're all hugged.

4668
02:38:40,760 --> 02:38:41,740
We're all hugged.

4669
02:38:42,420 --> 02:38:43,520
Wait, Nacha, Nacha.

4670
02:38:44,360 --> 02:38:45,540
I'm fine, I'm fine.

4671
02:38:46,600 --> 02:38:47,760
Are we all fully?

4672
02:38:47,900 --> 02:38:48,540
Okay, I need hugs.

4673
02:38:48,620 --> 02:38:49,040
I need hugs.

4674
02:38:50,160 --> 02:38:50,740
Nacha's dead.

4675
02:38:50,900 --> 02:38:51,540
Nacha's dead.

4676
02:38:52,600 --> 02:38:53,140
Nacha's dead.

4677
02:38:53,240 --> 02:38:54,440
Can someone hug me?

4678
02:38:57,180 --> 02:38:59,500
Guys, I think we hugged too much.

4679
02:38:59,540 --> 02:39:00,260
Yeah, yeah, I need a hug.

4680
02:39:00,380 --> 02:39:01,840
I don't have, I don't have.

4681
02:39:02,360 --> 02:39:03,280
Okay, I can hug.

4682
02:39:03,480 --> 02:39:03,900
Okay, okay.

4683
02:39:04,320 --> 02:39:04,680
Alright.

4684
02:39:06,120 --> 02:39:09,640
Okay, I'm good, I'm good.

4685
02:39:10,280 --> 02:39:13,600
Alright, we don't have any more batteries for the defib.

4686
02:39:14,380 --> 02:39:15,100
Alright, goodbye.

4687
02:39:15,700 --> 02:39:16,200
Wait, wait, wait.

4688
02:39:16,580 --> 02:39:17,880
We should film the dead body.

4689
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:18,900
Did we film the dead body?

4690
02:39:19,220 --> 02:39:19,860
Yeah, I did.

4691
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:20,340
I did.

4692
02:39:20,360 --> 02:39:20,940
Okay, nice, nice.

4693
02:39:21,040 --> 02:39:21,460
Good content.

4694
02:39:22,480 --> 02:39:24,960
Okay, okay, can I do a pretend?

4695
02:39:25,700 --> 02:39:26,420
Pretend defib?

4696
02:39:26,600 --> 02:39:27,680
Okay, are you ready?

4697
02:39:28,620 --> 02:39:29,500
Are you filming?

4698
02:39:31,200 --> 02:39:32,660
Don't you die on me, Nacha!

4699
02:39:33,800 --> 02:39:34,200
Don't you die on me, Nacha!

4700
02:39:34,200 --> 02:39:34,560
She's dead.

4701
02:39:34,720 --> 02:39:35,120
Okay.

4702
02:39:39,220 --> 02:39:39,620
Alright,

4703
02:39:43,160 --> 02:39:43,480
we're good.

4704
02:39:43,780 --> 02:39:45,580
We need to find more monsters.

4705
02:39:46,560 --> 02:39:47,600
Wait, there's something here.

4706
02:39:47,820 --> 02:39:48,780
Oh, yeah, yeah, no, no.

4707
02:39:49,260 --> 02:39:50,100
I see eyes.

4708
02:40:00,120 --> 02:40:00,560
Who's stuck?

4709
02:40:00,640 --> 02:40:01,200
Where are you?

4710
02:40:02,480 --> 02:40:03,820
Daniel, do you have the hugs?

4711
02:40:05,420 --> 02:40:06,420
Wait, did you...

4712
02:40:07,260 --> 02:40:08,260
Oh, she's coming!

4713
02:40:08,380 --> 02:40:08,960
The bus is coming!

4714
02:40:14,740 --> 02:40:15,180
Oh!

4715
02:40:15,180 --> 02:40:16,580
I don't have flashlight anymore.

4716
02:40:16,740 --> 02:40:17,320
Daniel, are you alive?

4717
02:40:19,480 --> 02:40:20,420
Daniel, are you alive?

4718
02:40:21,520 --> 02:40:23,140
I'm still alive, but I'm stuck.

4719
02:40:23,320 --> 02:40:24,100
I'm stuck.

4720
02:40:24,100 --> 02:40:25,080
Do you have the hugs?

4721
02:40:26,480 --> 02:40:27,560
Wait, yours have a hug.

4722
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:29,000
I'm stuck too!

4723
02:40:33,140 --> 02:40:34,140
Oh, I'm good.

4724
02:40:34,180 --> 02:40:34,320
I'm good.

4725
02:40:35,020 --> 02:40:36,600
Jump, jump, jump, jump.

4726
02:40:36,780 --> 02:40:37,740
Space box, space box.

4727
02:40:38,060 --> 02:40:39,020
I'm gonna die!

4728
02:40:39,240 --> 02:40:40,220
Oh my gosh!

4729
02:40:40,840 --> 02:40:42,320
Oh, I kicked it out!

4730
02:40:43,520 --> 02:40:44,440
Spider with me!

4731
02:40:44,440 --> 02:40:44,440
Spider with me!

4732
02:40:45,060 --> 02:40:47,540
I'm trying, I'm trying to get out of here.

4733
02:40:48,700 --> 02:40:49,760
We're slowly watching.

4734
02:40:50,140 --> 02:40:50,760
Film this!

4735
02:40:50,980 --> 02:40:51,460
Film this!

4736
02:40:51,800 --> 02:40:52,580
Film this, hero!

4737
02:40:52,600 --> 02:40:53,260
Film her dying!

4738
02:40:53,820 --> 02:40:54,420
Film it!

4739
02:40:54,520 --> 02:40:54,920
Film it!

4740
02:40:55,140 --> 02:40:55,260
Film it!

4741
02:40:56,040 --> 02:40:57,080
Give me my flashlight!

4742
02:40:57,400 --> 02:40:58,180
Take my flashlight!

4743
02:41:00,340 --> 02:41:01,160
Hero, leave!

4744
02:41:01,600 --> 02:41:02,040
Leave!

4745
02:41:02,120 --> 02:41:02,460
Leave!

4746
02:41:06,240 --> 02:41:07,940
Just go home!

4747
02:41:08,020 --> 02:41:08,540
Go home!

4748
02:41:09,300 --> 02:41:09,460
I

4749
02:41:13,130 --> 02:41:13,970
have a flashlight here.

4750
02:41:14,330 --> 02:41:15,230
Okay, okay, okay.

4751
02:41:15,530 --> 02:41:16,270
I got it.

4752
02:41:16,330 --> 02:41:16,730
I got it.

4753
02:41:17,790 --> 02:41:18,870
Do you need hugs?

4754
02:41:18,930 --> 02:41:19,370
Do you need hugs?

4755
02:41:20,270 --> 02:41:20,670
No.

4756
02:41:21,130 --> 02:41:22,530
How much film do you have left?

4757
02:41:22,650 --> 02:41:23,150
This is not our home!

4758
02:41:23,930 --> 02:41:25,310
We can find it!

4759
02:41:25,350 --> 02:41:26,090
We can find it!

4760
02:41:26,150 --> 02:41:26,990
We'll walk around!

4761
02:41:28,830 --> 02:41:30,390
Wait, I think it's the cars.

4762
02:41:31,470 --> 02:41:32,750
How much film do you have left?

4763
02:41:33,530 --> 02:41:34,410
How much film do you have left?

4764
02:41:34,410 --> 02:41:34,790
31%.

4765
02:41:34,790 --> 02:41:35,650
Okay, we go around.

4766
02:41:36,390 --> 02:41:38,050
I'm pretty sure we can go around here though.

4767
02:41:38,250 --> 02:41:38,290
Really?

4768
02:41:38,730 --> 02:41:39,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4769
02:41:40,470 --> 02:41:41,370
I believe.

4770
02:41:42,110 --> 02:41:43,730
It has to be like here somewhere.

4771
02:41:45,670 --> 02:41:46,470
Oh no.

4772
02:41:47,270 --> 02:41:48,450
I don't think so.

4773
02:41:48,450 --> 02:41:50,030
Oh no.

4774
02:41:51,390 --> 02:41:52,710
I think we need to go.

4775
02:41:52,850 --> 02:41:53,170
Woo!

4776
02:42:15,160 --> 02:42:15,800
Okay.

4777
02:42:16,640 --> 02:42:16,960
Alright.

4778
02:42:17,260 --> 02:42:18,420
We split up!

4779
02:42:29,640 --> 02:42:30,280
Hero!

4780
02:42:31,540 --> 02:42:32,500
Oh no.

4781
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:33,980
Oh no.

4782
02:42:34,200 --> 02:42:35,280
Down is up.

4783
02:42:36,020 --> 02:42:36,820
Down is up.

4784
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:38,880
Down is up.

4785
02:42:39,320 --> 02:42:40,760
You're so good at that.

4786
02:42:41,220 --> 02:42:42,480
Down is up.

4787
02:42:42,880 --> 02:42:44,220
Oh no.

4788
02:42:44,220 --> 02:42:46,220
Oh no.

4789
02:42:47,960 --> 02:42:48,540
Oh no.

4790
02:42:48,540 --> 02:42:49,360
Oh no.

4791
02:42:49,580 --> 02:42:51,380
I can't hug myself.

4792
02:42:53,920 --> 02:42:54,920
It's so over.

4793
02:42:55,140 --> 02:42:56,580
It's so over.

4794
02:42:56,940 --> 02:42:58,480
I don't know where to go.

4795
02:42:58,760 --> 02:43:00,240
Where do we go?

4796
02:43:02,960 --> 02:43:04,680
Down is not up.

4797
02:43:05,520 --> 02:43:06,240
Oh!

4798
02:43:06,260 --> 02:43:06,820
Hero!

4799
02:43:06,900 --> 02:43:07,820
He's still alive!

4800
02:43:10,760 --> 02:43:11,820
I don't...

4801
02:43:11,820 --> 02:43:14,380
Oh my god.

4802
02:43:14,420 --> 02:43:14,740
Hero!

4803
02:43:16,300 --> 02:43:17,560
Holy shit.

4804
02:43:17,600 --> 02:43:18,840
How do we get home?

4805
02:43:20,820 --> 02:43:22,960
How the fuck do we get home?

4806
02:43:23,320 --> 02:43:24,820
There's a little screamy guy!

4807
02:43:26,320 --> 02:43:27,380
Oh god.

4808
02:43:27,600 --> 02:43:29,080
Oh my god.

4809
02:43:30,140 --> 02:43:31,540
Where is home?

4810
02:43:31,840 --> 02:43:33,300
Where is home?

4811
02:43:33,740 --> 02:43:34,440
Where is home?

4812
02:43:34,440 --> 02:43:34,860
Where is home?

4813
02:43:37,100 --> 02:43:37,800
Where is home?

4814
02:43:37,820 --> 02:43:37,920
What?

4815
02:43:42,240 --> 02:43:42,800
Oh god.

4816
02:43:43,360 --> 02:43:43,760
Oh!

4817
02:43:48,770 --> 02:43:49,170
Hero!

4818
02:43:49,470 --> 02:43:49,870
Oh!

4819
02:43:50,090 --> 02:43:50,890
You know what?

4820
02:43:53,860 --> 02:43:55,040
We're so smart!

4821
02:43:55,860 --> 02:43:56,680
Oh my god!

4822
02:43:57,140 --> 02:43:59,420
The spider followed me all the way to the ship.

4823
02:43:59,500 --> 02:44:00,220
Jesus Christ.

4824
02:44:00,360 --> 02:44:00,680
Okay, wait.

4825
02:44:00,740 --> 02:44:00,820
Wait.

4826
02:44:00,840 --> 02:44:01,200
We stay here.

4827
02:44:01,340 --> 02:44:02,260
How much film do you have left?

4828
02:44:02,920 --> 02:44:04,220
I have 18%.

4829
02:44:04,220 --> 02:44:04,760
Okay.

4830
02:44:04,760 --> 02:44:04,880
Okay.

4831
02:44:04,880 --> 02:44:05,500
I'm gonna hug you.

4832
02:44:06,260 --> 02:44:06,660
Okay.

4833
02:44:06,840 --> 02:44:06,940
Okay.

4834
02:44:06,940 --> 02:44:07,380
We're gonna...

4835
02:44:07,380 --> 02:44:08,460
I'm gonna leave them... Okay.

4836
02:44:08,540 --> 02:44:08,620
Okay.

4837
02:44:08,620 --> 02:44:09,400
You hug me.

4838
02:44:09,800 --> 02:44:12,040
And then like we're gonna... I'm gonna...

4839
02:44:12,040 --> 02:44:12,800
Can you hug me?

4840
02:44:13,020 --> 02:44:14,640
And then I'm gonna do it for content.

4841
02:44:15,740 --> 02:44:16,760
How much person?

4842
02:44:17,080 --> 02:44:18,580
I have 16.

4843
02:44:18,780 --> 02:44:19,040
Okay.

4844
02:44:19,100 --> 02:44:19,880
Are you ready to film?

4845
02:44:20,220 --> 02:44:21,660
Please film more than Ditto.

4846
02:44:22,100 --> 02:44:23,760
Please film more than Ditto.

4847
02:44:24,240 --> 02:44:24,720
Okay.

4848
02:44:24,940 --> 02:44:25,420
Okay.

4849
02:44:25,560 --> 02:44:25,560
Okay.

4850
02:44:25,560 --> 02:44:25,780
Okay.

4851
02:44:25,780 --> 02:44:26,060
Okay.

4852
02:44:26,060 --> 02:44:26,380
Okay.

4853
02:44:26,680 --> 02:44:27,160
Okay.

4854
02:44:27,640 --> 02:44:28,720
I'm gonna drop the flashlight.

4855
02:44:28,860 --> 02:44:29,000
Alright.

4856
02:44:29,140 --> 02:44:29,840
Here we go.

4857
02:44:31,060 --> 02:44:31,540
Hello.

4858
02:44:33,040 --> 02:44:33,520
Hello.

4859
02:44:35,500 --> 02:44:37,900
I'm gonna... I'll do this for content.

4860
02:44:38,760 --> 02:44:39,240
Hello.

4861
02:44:40,400 --> 02:44:41,520
Where are the monsters?

4862
02:44:42,420 --> 02:44:45,460
Oh, now all the monsters stop fucking trying to kill me.

4863
02:44:46,100 --> 02:44:46,820
Oh, wow.

4864
02:44:47,400 --> 02:44:48,580
The one time.

4865
02:44:51,340 --> 02:44:51,860
Hello?

4866
02:44:57,270 --> 02:44:58,470
I hear him.

4867
02:44:58,690 --> 02:44:59,210
Hello?

4868
02:45:02,650 --> 02:45:03,170
Hello?

4869
02:45:06,070 --> 02:45:06,590
Hello?

4870
02:45:12,920 --> 02:45:13,820
I'm right here.

4871
02:45:15,020 --> 02:45:15,980
I'm right here.

4872
02:45:16,840 --> 02:45:17,080
Oh!

4873
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:21,320
Oh, I messed up!

4874
02:45:21,540 --> 02:45:21,960
No!

4875
02:45:31,090 --> 02:45:31,970
Guys,

4876
02:45:37,940 --> 02:45:39,100
I didn't mean it.

4877
02:45:39,600 --> 02:45:40,820
It's over.

4878
02:45:41,700 --> 02:45:43,060
It's over.

4879
02:45:43,540 --> 02:45:45,360
I don't think she...

4880
02:45:45,360 --> 02:45:45,880
She's dead?

4881
02:45:47,680 --> 02:45:48,560
She's dead.

4882
02:45:53,080 --> 02:45:53,860
I'm dead.

4883
02:45:55,480 --> 02:45:56,440
It's okay.

4884
02:45:56,480 --> 02:45:57,840
I threw everything away.

4885
02:45:57,940 --> 02:45:59,040
I threw everything.

4886
02:46:04,620 --> 02:46:08,000
I sacrificed myself for content.

4887
02:46:08,980 --> 02:46:10,420
For content.

4888
02:46:10,760 --> 02:46:11,300
Oh my god.

4889
02:46:11,300 --> 02:46:12,460
I saw all of them.

4890
02:46:13,480 --> 02:46:14,920
I saw...

4891
02:46:14,920 --> 02:46:16,460
I saw all of them.

4892
02:46:16,760 --> 02:46:20,000
Look, I... He hit me into the fucking tongue.

4893
02:46:20,800 --> 02:46:21,540
He hit me into the fucking tongue.

4894
02:46:21,540 --> 02:46:22,620
Wait, parkour.

4895
02:46:23,080 --> 02:46:23,740
I got the tongue.

4896
02:46:23,860 --> 02:46:25,100
I got tongued.

4897
02:46:26,100 --> 02:46:27,700
I died for content.

4898
02:46:28,380 --> 02:46:28,820
Nice.

4899
02:46:29,440 --> 02:46:31,360
Alright, let's check how many views we get.

4900
02:46:32,560 --> 02:46:33,880
How many views did we get?

4901
02:46:34,120 --> 02:46:34,940
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

4902
02:46:37,160 --> 02:46:37,600
Okay.

4903
02:46:38,820 --> 02:46:39,760
We're watching time.

4904
02:46:40,180 --> 02:46:41,260
No, no, no, no, no.

4905
02:46:43,200 --> 02:46:44,140
Guys, guys, guys.

4906
02:46:44,160 --> 02:46:44,460
Watch this.

4907
02:46:46,380 --> 02:46:47,860
I need hugs, guys.

4908
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:48,520
I need hugs.

4909
02:46:57,530 --> 02:46:57,970
Okay.

4910
02:46:58,110 --> 02:46:58,690
Are you filming?

4911
02:47:00,490 --> 02:47:01,930
Don't you dare be that chance.

4912
02:47:09,710 --> 02:47:11,010
That spider.

4913
02:47:11,030 --> 02:47:12,710
That spider was so scary.

4914
02:47:13,530 --> 02:47:14,210
Yeah.

4915
02:47:17,990 --> 02:47:19,410
Don't have flashlights on.

4916
02:47:19,810 --> 02:47:20,490
Hey.

4917
02:47:20,690 --> 02:47:23,510
Oh my

4918
02:47:27,570 --> 02:47:27,570
god.

4919
02:47:27,570 --> 02:47:28,850
You're gonna jump something.

4920
02:47:30,130 --> 02:47:31,870
Filming, filming, filming.

4921
02:47:36,500 --> 02:47:37,760
Oh my god.

4922
02:47:37,760 --> 02:47:38,360
Holy shit.

4923
02:47:38,920 --> 02:47:39,920
Oh my god.

4924
02:47:39,920 --> 02:47:40,080
Oh my god.

4925
02:47:40,080 --> 02:47:43,580
I can't get all of that.

4926
02:47:48,340 --> 02:47:49,740
Holy shit.

4927
02:47:49,860 --> 02:47:51,340
Oh my god.

4928
02:47:51,600 --> 02:47:53,380
Oh my god, you know.

4929
02:47:56,680 --> 02:47:58,120
Oh my god.

4930
02:48:06,300 --> 02:48:06,940
Oh my god.

4931
02:48:06,940 --> 02:48:07,940
That's such good filming.

4932
02:48:08,700 --> 02:48:09,900
Oh my god.

4933
02:48:10,960 --> 02:48:12,000
Oh my god.

4934
02:48:12,060 --> 02:48:12,380
200.

4935
02:48:13,660 --> 02:48:14,940
Oh my god.

4936
02:48:14,940 --> 02:48:15,560
200.

4937
02:48:15,560 --> 02:48:16,140
Holy shit.

4938
02:48:16,380 --> 02:48:17,480
Oh my god.

4939
02:48:17,500 --> 02:48:18,360
We did it.

4940
02:48:18,480 --> 02:48:19,120
That was great.

4941
02:48:19,780 --> 02:48:23,800
I feel like Hiro has been the best filmer.

4942
02:48:23,940 --> 02:48:24,820
I feel like Hiro has been the best filmer.

4943
02:48:24,820 --> 02:48:25,720
Of all of us.

4944
02:48:25,760 --> 02:48:26,840
She's peak cinema.

4945
02:48:26,840 --> 02:48:28,780
Actually movie director.

4946
02:48:29,080 --> 02:48:29,500
Vlog.

4947
02:48:33,040 --> 02:48:34,000
What's this?

4948
02:48:34,360 --> 02:48:34,860
What's this?

4949
02:48:35,220 --> 02:48:36,800
She's gonna be the new Paul brothers.

4950
02:48:37,160 --> 02:48:37,400
Yeah.

4951
02:48:37,700 --> 02:48:40,480
The spider gave us a lot.

4952
02:48:41,800 --> 02:48:42,820
Oh my god.

4953
02:48:42,840 --> 02:48:43,960
The spider gave us a lot.

4954
02:48:44,960 --> 02:48:45,560
Yeah.

4955
02:48:46,900 --> 02:48:48,420
She's the best film director.

4956
02:48:48,480 --> 02:48:49,660
From all of us.

4957
02:48:50,980 --> 02:48:52,680
Actually a good film.

4958
02:48:54,460 --> 02:48:56,220
Can we ever lose?

4959
02:48:56,220 --> 02:48:57,980
We're so good at this game.

4960
02:48:58,280 --> 02:48:59,580
We're never gonna lose.

4961
02:49:01,120 --> 02:49:02,620
We can get a million views.

4962
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:04,140
I feel like we can.

4963
02:49:04,260 --> 02:49:04,500
Yeah.

4964
02:49:05,240 --> 02:49:07,320
We have... how much money?

4965
02:49:07,460 --> 02:49:08,760
We have like 900 dollars.

4966
02:49:10,060 --> 02:49:11,700
Is there anything else we should get?

4967
02:49:12,220 --> 02:49:13,860
I think...

4968
02:49:13,860 --> 02:49:15,820
Okay, I need another flashlight.

4969
02:49:16,140 --> 02:49:17,940
Or another defib.

4970
02:49:18,080 --> 02:49:19,240
Or hugger.

4971
02:49:19,360 --> 02:49:21,560
Wait, who has the hugger and defib?

4972
02:49:22,580 --> 02:49:23,140
Me.

4973
02:49:23,340 --> 02:49:24,100
I have hugger.

4974
02:49:24,100 --> 02:49:25,680
I have revive.

4975
02:49:26,220 --> 02:49:27,480
I don't think we need like...

4976
02:49:27,480 --> 02:49:28,680
more than one.

4977
02:49:28,940 --> 02:49:30,020
I just need a flashlight.

4978
02:49:30,180 --> 02:49:30,800
That's all I need.

4979
02:49:32,100 --> 02:49:33,420
Do we need...

4980
02:49:34,180 --> 02:49:35,100
the revive?

4981
02:49:35,440 --> 02:49:36,460
One more?

4982
02:49:37,020 --> 02:49:38,000
No, I think we're fine.

4983
02:49:38,800 --> 02:49:42,520
I think hugging is much more important than defib.

4984
02:49:42,520 --> 02:49:42,740
Right?

4985
02:49:43,480 --> 02:49:43,940
Yeah.

4986
02:49:46,740 --> 02:49:49,000
We gotta save the homie with the hugs.

4987
02:49:52,900 --> 02:49:54,260
Wait, we should get taser.

4988
02:49:54,380 --> 02:49:55,000
Wait, wait, wait.

4989
02:49:56,220 --> 02:49:56,760
How much money do we have?

4990
02:49:56,920 --> 02:49:57,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4991
02:49:59,040 --> 02:49:59,960
I'll be DPS.

4992
02:50:00,440 --> 02:50:01,320
I'll be DPS.

4993
02:50:01,580 --> 02:50:01,860
Okay.

4994
02:50:03,820 --> 02:50:05,240
You gotta film this though.

4995
02:50:08,830 --> 02:50:09,230
Watch.

4996
02:50:09,550 --> 02:50:09,810
Wow!

4997
02:50:10,450 --> 02:50:11,330
What is this?

4998
02:50:12,670 --> 02:50:13,350
Okay, wait, wait.

4999
02:50:13,370 --> 02:50:13,790
Who's filming?

5000
02:50:13,990 --> 02:50:14,610
Where's the film?

5001
02:50:15,470 --> 02:50:16,910
Wait, it's in the ground.

5002
02:50:17,850 --> 02:50:18,710
Wait, who's filming?

5003
02:50:18,870 --> 02:50:18,930
I have it.

5004
02:50:19,970 --> 02:50:20,590
I have it.

5005
02:50:21,090 --> 02:50:21,670
Okay, are you ready?

5006
02:50:21,850 --> 02:50:22,690
Are you filming?

5007
02:50:23,510 --> 02:50:24,670
Yeah, I'm filming.

5008
02:50:24,850 --> 02:50:25,390
Okay, watch this.

5009
02:50:29,210 --> 02:50:29,650
What?

5010
02:50:30,510 --> 02:50:31,390
Why me?

5011
02:50:34,570 --> 02:50:35,450
Fuck you!

5012
02:50:37,810 --> 02:50:38,690
Why me?

5013
02:50:40,810 --> 02:50:41,390
Why me?

5014
02:50:41,710 --> 02:50:43,330
You said you wanted to know.

5015
02:50:43,570 --> 02:50:44,010
Do it again!

5016
02:50:44,130 --> 02:50:44,430
Do it again!

5017
02:50:44,530 --> 02:50:45,230
Okay, you do it again.

5018
02:50:51,920 --> 02:50:54,000
You wanted to know what it was.

5019
02:50:54,940 --> 02:50:55,380
Why me?

5020
02:50:55,380 --> 02:50:56,120
Why me?

5021
02:50:56,120 --> 02:50:58,500
Are you ready?

5022
02:51:00,320 --> 02:51:01,200
Last day.

5023
02:51:01,580 --> 02:51:02,660
Should we get the emote?

5024
02:51:04,520 --> 02:51:05,480
What should we get?

5025
02:51:06,260 --> 02:51:06,740
Flashlight?

5026
02:51:06,920 --> 02:51:07,660
What should we get?

5027
02:51:08,720 --> 02:51:09,680
Or emote.

5028
02:51:11,120 --> 02:51:12,540
We all have an emote.

5029
02:51:14,380 --> 02:51:16,040
I have only one emote.

5030
02:51:16,280 --> 02:51:18,560
We can all only have one emote.

5031
02:51:18,620 --> 02:51:21,000
We can't like overlap it.

5032
02:51:21,120 --> 02:51:21,240
We can't like overlap it.

5033
02:51:21,240 --> 02:51:21,440
Yeah.

5034
02:51:22,240 --> 02:51:23,280
Are you all ready?

5035
02:51:23,440 --> 02:51:23,920
Let's go.

5036
02:51:25,960 --> 02:51:26,360
Yoga.

5037
02:51:27,040 --> 02:51:27,840
Oh, yoga.

5038
02:51:29,440 --> 02:51:30,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:51:30,860 --> 02:51:31,320
Let's see.

5040
02:51:32,260 --> 02:51:33,480
What is her emote?

5041
02:51:34,420 --> 02:51:35,420
I wanna see.

5042
02:51:35,960 --> 02:51:37,280
We need to emote on the monsters.

5043
02:51:37,980 --> 02:51:38,920
Oh, true, true.

5044
02:51:39,100 --> 02:51:41,200
Oh, when I zap them, we emote.

5045
02:51:42,200 --> 02:51:43,100
Okay, okay, okay.

5046
02:51:43,400 --> 02:51:44,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:51:48,440 --> 02:51:48,840
Yeah.

02:51:52,100 --> 02:51:52,980
Yeah, let's get it.

5049
02:51:53,520 --> 02:51:53,940
Let's go.

5050
02:51:56,200 --> 02:51:57,160
We got this.

5051
02:51:58,020 --> 02:51:58,540
Okay.

5052
02:51:59,800 --> 02:52:00,320
Yeah.

5053
02:52:00,780 --> 02:52:02,720
We gotta get our first million views.

5054
02:52:07,290 --> 02:52:07,810
What?

5055
02:52:08,250 --> 02:52:08,770
What?

5056
02:52:10,210 --> 02:52:10,970
What is that?

5057
02:52:11,390 --> 02:52:11,910
Oh.

5058
02:52:14,010 --> 02:52:14,530
Oh!

5059
02:52:15,890 --> 02:52:18,030
Film, film, film, film, film, film, film!

5060
02:52:18,690 --> 02:52:19,850
Oh, he's falling!

5061
02:52:19,950 --> 02:52:20,350
He fell!

5062
02:52:20,430 --> 02:52:20,750
He fell!

5063
02:52:24,730 --> 02:52:25,770
He's dead.

5064
02:52:27,030 --> 02:52:27,270
He's dead.

5065
02:52:29,330 --> 02:52:29,930
He's...

5066
02:52:30,990 --> 02:52:32,850
He's... He's a gay dead.

5067
02:52:33,770 --> 02:52:34,370
He's a gay dead.

5068
02:52:34,370 --> 02:52:35,210
Come on.

5069
02:52:35,330 --> 02:52:36,390
I can't...

5070
02:52:37,150 --> 02:52:37,750
Nice.

5071
02:52:39,030 --> 02:52:40,150
Look at us.

5072
02:52:40,190 --> 02:52:40,990
We're so good.

5073
02:52:41,670 --> 02:52:43,330
Rest in peace, spider.

5074
02:52:44,270 --> 02:52:47,070
Okay, we gotta find somebody I can zap.

5075
02:52:47,270 --> 02:52:47,370
I'm so scared.

5076
02:52:47,370 --> 02:52:47,370
I'm so scared.

5077
02:52:47,370 --> 02:52:47,750
I'm so scared.

5078
02:52:47,770 --> 02:52:47,930
I'm so scared.

5079
02:52:51,150 --> 02:52:51,970
It's him!

5080
02:52:51,970 --> 02:52:52,430
It's him!

5081
02:52:52,430 --> 02:52:53,010
It's him!

5082
02:52:53,290 --> 02:52:53,890
Oh,

5083
02:52:59,120 --> 02:52:59,720
he's not...

5084
02:52:59,720 --> 02:53:00,100
Take a picture!

5085
02:53:00,240 --> 02:53:00,620
Take a picture!

5086
02:53:00,980 --> 02:53:01,500
No, film!

5087
02:53:01,740 --> 02:53:02,200
Film him!

5088
02:53:02,460 --> 02:53:03,660
Wait, you have to be okay!

5089
02:53:03,840 --> 02:53:04,160
Okay!

5090
02:53:04,280 --> 02:53:04,600
Okay!

5091
02:53:04,920 --> 02:53:05,240
Okay!

5092
02:53:06,440 --> 02:53:07,580
I have no more zap!

5093
02:53:07,700 --> 02:53:08,500
I have no more zap!

5094
02:53:09,720 --> 02:53:10,780
I'm... I'm hugging...

5095
02:53:10,780 --> 02:53:12,720
I don't think...

5096
02:53:12,720 --> 02:53:13,500
I'm hugging the monster!

5097
02:53:14,240 --> 02:53:20,380
I can hug you!

5098
02:53:20,440 --> 02:53:20,960
I can hug you!

5099
02:53:22,080 --> 02:53:22,880
Goodbye now, Chad.

Can you hug me?

5101
02:53:25,340 --> 02:53:25,820
Can you hug me?

02:53:25,820 --> 02:53:26,100
Yeah, yeah.

5103
02:53:26,100 --> 02:53:26,420
Where is it?

5104
02:53:26,520 --> 02:53:26,840
Where is it?

5105
02:53:26,860 --> 02:53:27,140
Where is it?

5106
02:53:27,680 --> 02:53:28,200
Hug me!

5107
02:53:28,460 --> 02:53:28,920

02:53:29,780 --> 02:53:30,440
You guys hug each other!

You guys hug each other!

5111
02:53:31,580 --> 02:53:31,980
Yeah!

5112
02:53:33,680 --> 02:53:34,120
Okay!

5113
02:53:34,320 --> 02:53:34,660
Oh!

5114
02:53:34,660 --> 02:53:35,060
Wait!

5115
02:53:38,520 --> 02:53:38,800
Hug!

5116
02:53:38,900 --> 02:53:39,820
Oh, that's nice!

5117
02:53:40,080 --> 02:53:42,240
I can hug while being hugged.

5118
02:53:42,240 --> 02:53:43,020
I feel like...

5119
02:53:43,020 --> 02:53:44,680
Yeah, you should be... Hug me!

5120
02:53:45,040 --> 02:53:45,480
Okay.

5121
02:53:45,580 --> 02:53:46,020
We're okay.

5122
02:53:46,120 --> 02:53:46,440
We're okay.

5123
02:53:46,880 --> 02:53:47,320
Okay.

5124
02:53:47,340 --> 02:53:47,860
Hug me!

5125
02:53:48,120 --> 02:53:48,140
Hug me!

5126
02:53:48,840 --> 02:53:51,700

5127
02:53:51,700 --> 02:53:52,100

5128
02:53:52,100 --> 02:53:52,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

5129
02:53:52,720 --> 02:53:53,040
Let's go!

5130
02:53:53,120 --> 02:53:53,360
Let's go!

5131
02:53:54,040 --> 02:53:55,200
Yeah, yeah.

5132
02:53:55,920 --> 02:53:56,500
Let's go!

5133
02:53:56,540 --> 02:53:56,840
Let's go!

5134
02:53:57,380 --> 02:54:00,560
I can hug while being hugged.

5135
02:54:00,780 --> 02:54:02,420
I can hug while being hugged.

5136
02:54:03,040 --> 02:54:05,340
Guys, I don't have a zap anymore.

5137
02:54:08,660 --> 02:54:09,020
What?

5138
02:54:09,020 --> 02:54:09,680
He's scared!

5280
02:58:25,580 --> 02:58:26,140

Yeah, no, they're dead.

They're definitely dead.

5291
02:58:49,860 --> 02:58:50,860
Come inside!

5292
02:58:50,860 --> 02:58:51,340

02:58:55,300 --> 02:58:56,000
Come inside!

5294
02:58:57,200 --> 02:58:58,020

Okay.

5299
02:59:07,220 --> 02:59:07,580
Okay.

Where is he?

5301
02:59:09,560 --> 02:59:10,560
He's right in front of us.

5302
02:59:13,640 --> 02:59:14,940
I think he left.

5303
02:59:17,720 --> 02:59:19,800
Okay, okay, you wanna film something really cool?

5304
02:59:21,200 --> 02:59:21,900

Okay, I'm gonna throw away stuff.

02:59:25,100 --> 02:59:26,740
And then we're gonna film something really cool.

02:59:27,820 --> 02:59:28,180
Okay.

What?

5315
02:59:39,460 --> 02:59:40,940
I think we left her to dead too.

5316
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:41,500
Okay, okay, okay.

5317
02:59:41,540 --> 02:59:41,780
Alright.

Okay, I know where to go.

Okay.

5326
02:59:54,800 --> 02:59:56,460
Don't worry, I know exactly where to go.

5327
02:59:56,560 --> 02:59:57,400
It's gonna be so cool.

5328
02:59:58,880 --> 02:59:59,320
Wait.

5329
03:00:02,540 --> 03:00:03,640
It's okay, they're not close.

5330
03:00:03,800 --> 03:00:04,180
They're not close.

5331
03:00:06,380 --> 03:00:07,240
Alright, right here.

5332
03:00:07,760 --> 03:00:08,620
They are close!

5333
03:00:08,860 --> 03:00:09,540
They are close!

5334
03:00:11,840 --> 03:00:12,280
Wait,

5335
03:00:17,560 --> 03:00:17,800

5336
03:00:20,080 --> 03:00:20,520
Goodbye!

5337
03:00:21,680 --> 03:00:22,120
Goodbye!

5338
03:00:23,440 --> 03:00:26,880
Close door, close door, close door, close door, close door, close door, close door!

5339
03:00:29,120 --> 03:00:30,160
Oh my god.

5340
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:32,380
Oh my god, are you okay?

5341
03:00:32,520 --> 03:00:33,560
Are you okay?

5342
03:00:34,960 --> 03:00:35,800
Oh, god.

5343
03:00:36,460 --> 03:00:37,880
We're gonna be okay.

5344
03:00:38,340 --> 03:00:38,860
Okay.

5345
03:00:39,900 --> 03:00:40,420
Okay.

5346
03:00:42,520 --> 03:00:43,040
Alright.

5347
03:00:43,260 --> 03:00:45,040
I couldn't find the cool thing.

5348
03:00:45,560 --> 03:00:47,500
It was gonna be like parkour.

5349
03:00:47,540 --> 03:00:48,980
I was gonna parkour.

5350
03:00:49,300 --> 03:00:49,820
Hahaha.

5351
03:00:49,820 --> 03:00:49,840
Hahaha.

5352
03:00:51,340 --> 03:00:52,140
Hahaha.

5353
03:00:52,280 --> 03:00:54,500
He was like so close.

5354
03:00:54,500 --> 03:00:56,080
He was so close.

5355
03:00:56,820 --> 03:00:58,940
I wanted to parkour.

5356
03:01:00,600 --> 03:01:03,420
There's a defib and a flashlight inside.

5357
03:01:04,480 --> 03:01:07,020
There's a defib and a flashlight in the ship.

5358
03:01:07,020 --> 03:01:07,680
Follow me.

5359
03:01:08,860 --> 03:01:10,320
I'm gonna charge my...

5360
03:01:10,320 --> 03:01:13,880
No, I couldn't do my parkour.

5361
03:01:13,920 --> 03:01:15,960
It was gonna be so cool.

5362
03:01:16,580 --> 03:01:17,320
Hahaha.

5363
03:01:17,320 --> 03:01:19,580
It was gonna be so cool.

5364
03:01:20,660 --> 03:01:21,220
Alright.

5365
03:01:21,860 --> 03:01:23,340
I'm charging my thing.

5366
03:01:24,420 --> 03:01:24,980
Nice.

5367
03:01:25,800 --> 03:01:26,160
Nice.

5368
03:01:27,740 --> 03:01:29,220
Oh yeah, who wants the hug?

5369
03:01:30,500 --> 03:01:31,940
I dropped the hug.

5370
03:01:33,600 --> 03:01:34,800
Anyone wants it?

5371
03:01:35,580 --> 03:01:38,160
Maybe we have to buy one more hug.

5372
03:01:38,300 --> 03:01:38,760
Hahaha.

5373
03:01:38,760 --> 03:01:39,840
You need one more?

5374
03:01:39,960 --> 03:01:41,500
Okay, I'll buy one more.

5375
03:01:41,640 --> 03:01:42,160
I lost one.

5376
03:01:42,280 --> 03:01:43,480
Oh, we lost one?

5377
03:01:43,640 --> 03:01:44,100
Okay, yeah.

5378
03:01:44,180 --> 03:01:45,380
We need another hug.

5379
03:01:45,440 --> 03:01:45,660
Yeah.

5380
03:01:45,920 --> 03:01:46,780
Oh my god.

She is so cute.

5382
03:01:47,320 --> 03:01:47,780
It's so long.

5383
03:01:48,220 --> 03:01:48,700

5384
03:01:50,800 --> 03:01:51,280
Nice.

03:01:53,100 --> 03:01:53,920
Alright, I got it.

5386
03:01:54,180 --> 03:01:56,080
We should save it.

5387
03:01:56,180 --> 03:01:57,280
We already have the views.

5388
03:01:57,640 --> 03:01:58,600
Yeah, we should save it.

5389
03:01:59,640 --> 03:01:59,920
Alright.

5390
03:02:00,520 --> 03:02:02,840
Yeah, cause we're...

5391
03:02:02,840 --> 03:02:04,840
We're two good content creators.

5392
03:02:05,300 --> 03:02:06,280
We're just so good.

5393
03:02:06,520 --> 03:02:08,100
You guys are so good.

5394
03:02:08,360 --> 03:02:09,720
I know, we're so good at this.

5395
03:02:09,920 --> 03:02:11,020
I'm so inspired.

5396
03:02:12,960 --> 03:02:14,700
Now I'm so happy.

5397
03:02:19,160 --> 03:02:21,680
I wanna get one million... one million views.

5398
03:02:23,900 --> 03:02:25,140
Oh my god.

5399
03:02:25,260 --> 03:02:25,300
Oh my god.

5401
03:02:29,580 --> 03:02:30,700
Holy shit.

5402
03:02:31,260 --> 03:02:31,800
Holy shit.

03:02:34,180 --> 03:02:34,740
644.

5405
03:02:35,160 --> 03:02:37,940
Is the next one one million?

5406
03:02:38,140 --> 03:02:40,260
Yeah, I think next one is one million.

5407
03:02:40,380 --> 03:02:40,500
Yeah.

5408
03:02:41,720 --> 03:02:42,280
Okay.

5409
03:02:43,260 --> 03:02:44,820
Nachan is gonna film today.

5410
03:02:44,820 --> 03:02:45,180
Alright.

5411
03:02:45,360 --> 03:02:46,820
I believe in Nachan.

5412
03:02:47,720 --> 03:02:49,400
We only have one hug.

5413
03:02:50,700 --> 03:02:52,460
We have revive and hot hug.

5414
03:02:52,800 --> 03:02:53,640
Where's my flashlight?

5415
03:02:55,220 --> 03:02:56,940
We don't have money though.

5416
03:02:57,220 --> 03:02:57,960
Do we?

5417
03:02:58,820 --> 03:03:00,680
Do we have money for a hug?

5418
03:03:01,340 --> 03:03:02,640
Where's my other flashlight?

5419
03:03:04,140 --> 03:03:05,740
I have flashlight.

5420
03:03:06,300 --> 03:03:06,720
Okay.

5428
03:03:22,420 --> 03:03:23,880
He didn't crash.

5429
03:03:23,880 --> 03:03:23,900

5443
03:03:45,780 --> 03:03:47,160
Oh, wait, did we start that?

5444
03:03:47,300 --> 03:03:49,000
No, you couldn't.

5445
03:03:49,000 --> 03:03:50,980
Sorry, I forgot it's muted on Discord.

5446

5453
03:04:03,680 --> 03:04:06,540
Are we still in the same area?

5454
03:04:06,760 --> 03:04:07,460
Same level?

Okay, okay.

03:04:10,080 --> 03:04:11,540
I didn't receive the invite.

5458
03:04:12,860 --> 03:04:14,080
You sent the invite again?

5459
03:04:16,040 --> 03:04:16,620

03:04:24,680 --> 03:04:24,960
Okay.

Okay.

03:04:32,620 --> 03:04:33,280
It's the same.

5474
03:04:33,540 --> 03:04:34,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5475
03:04:34,300 --> 03:04:35,540
I was gonna be like, no.

5476
03:04:37,060 --> 03:04:37,860
No, it's fine.

5477
03:04:37,860 --> 03:04:38,520
It's fine.

5478
03:04:38,520 --> 03:04:39,020
We're okay.

5479
03:04:39,480 --> 03:04:40,340
We're okay, guys.

5480
03:04:40,480 --> 03:04:40,960
We didn't lose.

5481
03:04:41,260 --> 03:04:41,440
Oh, I'm the same.

5482
03:04:41,440 --> 03:04:41,520
I'm the same.

5483
03:04:41,540 --> 03:04:42,740
We didn't lose.

5484
03:04:42,760 --> 03:04:43,360
You guys...

5485
03:04:43,960 --> 03:04:45,200
Wait, did we lose our items?

5486
03:04:46,400 --> 03:04:47,980
Maybe we lost our items.

5487
03:04:47,980 --> 03:04:49,680
We lost our items.

5488
03:04:50,180 --> 03:04:50,360
Nachan.

5489
03:04:51,140 --> 03:04:52,220
No, I got one of the...

5490
03:04:52,220 --> 03:04:52,880
I got the flashlight.

5491
03:04:53,640 --> 03:04:54,780
I don't have the shinko.

5492
03:04:54,780 --> 03:04:55,460
Okay, where is she?

5493
03:04:55,460 --> 03:04:58,320
I don't have the shinko.

5494
03:04:58,320 --> 03:04:58,540
Riding.

5495
03:04:59,780 --> 03:05:00,220
Riding?

5496
03:05:00,780 --> 03:05:01,220
Okay.

5497
03:05:01,440 --> 03:05:02,700
Where are the other items?

5498
03:05:03,200 --> 03:05:03,640
No.

5499
03:05:04,760 --> 03:05:06,460
I lost the shock sticks.

5500
03:05:06,640 --> 03:05:07,840
Wait, did we actually lose the items?

5501
03:05:07,840 --> 03:05:09,520

Okay, okay.

5512
03:05:21,920 --> 03:05:22,720
Oh, my God.

5513
03:05:22,740 --> 03:05:24,260
My emote is still here, too.

5514
03:05:25,200 --> 03:05:26,200
How to dance.

5515
03:05:27,260 --> 03:05:28,580
I can still dance.

5516
03:05:33,840 --> 03:05:34,740
Are you ready?

5517
03:05:34,960 --> 03:05:36,180
All right, let's go, let's go, let's go.

5518
03:05:36,300 --> 03:05:36,840
Wait, hug her, hug her.

5519
03:05:37,080 --> 03:05:37,920
Wait, there's a hugger.

5520
03:05:37,940 --> 03:05:38,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5521
03:05:38,480 --> 03:05:39,080
I got the hugger.

5522
03:05:39,420 --> 03:05:39,840
Let's go.

5523
03:05:40,620 --> 03:05:41,180
Oh, my God.

5524
03:05:41,220 --> 03:05:41,520
I'm stuck.

5525
03:05:41,520 --> 03:05:42,460
I'm stuck.

5526
03:05:42,460 --> 03:05:42,840
I'm stuck.

5527
03:05:43,080 --> 03:05:43,840
Oh, no.

5528
03:05:44,160 --> 03:05:44,640
Guys.

5529
03:05:45,240 --> 03:05:46,200
Oh, I got out.

5530
03:05:46,320 --> 03:05:46,760
I got out.

5531
03:05:46,880 --> 03:05:47,540
Oh, my God.

5532
03:05:50,570 --> 03:05:51,410
Okay, I'm okay.

5533
03:05:54,310 --> 03:05:56,330
Can we afford a hug?

5534
03:05:56,630 --> 03:05:57,510
You want to buy another hugger?

5535
03:05:57,510 --> 03:05:58,650
Yeah, you can buy another hugger.

5536
03:05:58,650 --> 03:05:59,030
Okay, I bought it.

5537
03:05:59,090 --> 03:05:59,430
I bought it.

5538
03:06:00,290 --> 03:06:00,770
Okay.

5539
03:06:00,910 --> 03:06:01,910
I have the shot stick.

5540
03:06:07,460 --> 03:06:08,360
Oh, yeah.

5541
03:06:09,620 --> 03:06:11,340
Let me have the shot stick.

5542
03:06:12,980 --> 03:06:15,260
I'm gonna shot you every time.

5543
03:06:15,260 --> 03:06:15,560
No.

5544
03:06:15,640 --> 03:06:16,120
Every...

5545
03:06:16,120 --> 03:06:16,740
Maybe...

5546
03:06:16,760 --> 03:06:17,760
Every minute I was naked.

5547
03:06:18,040 --> 03:06:18,560
I was shaking.

5548
03:06:21,860 --> 03:06:22,360
No.

5549
03:06:23,040 --> 03:06:23,640
That's not fair.

5550
03:06:28,360 --> 03:06:29,200
Alright, let's go.

5551
03:06:29,560 --> 03:06:30,060
Film.

5552
03:06:30,240 --> 03:06:31,040
Film time.

5553
03:06:31,400 --> 03:06:31,460
No.

5554
03:06:31,640 --> 03:06:32,000
No.

5555
03:06:32,000 --> 03:06:32,200
No.

5556
03:06:32,260 --> 03:06:32,600
Need to go.

5557
03:06:32,700 --> 03:06:33,220
Film time.

5558
03:06:34,100 --> 03:06:34,480
Yeah.

5559
03:06:34,880 --> 03:06:35,760
I'm doing good.

5560
03:06:36,220 --> 03:06:37,300
1 million views.

5561
03:06:37,560 --> 03:06:38,300
1 million views.

5562
03:06:38,420 --> 03:06:38,940
We got this.

5563
03:06:39,060 --> 03:06:40,300
1 million views.

5564
03:06:40,300 --> 03:06:40,460
I believe.

5565
03:06:40,460 --> 03:06:41,580
1 million views.

5566
03:06:41,800 --> 03:06:42,220
Let's go.

5567
03:06:43,500 --> 03:06:44,780
I believe in us.

5568
03:06:45,920 --> 03:06:46,740
We can do it.

5569
03:06:46,740 --> 03:06:52,100
We're so good at content!

5570
03:06:52,700 --> 03:06:53,460
Wait, is this new?

5571
03:06:55,360 --> 03:06:55,940
Woah!

5572
03:06:58,500 --> 03:07:00,020
Yeah, this is a weird area.

5573
03:07:00,720 --> 03:07:01,480
Woah!

5574
03:07:06,460 --> 03:07:07,820
Oh, it's here!

5575
03:07:08,420 --> 03:07:09,480
Oh, it's this area!

5576
03:07:09,480 --> 03:07:10,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

5577
03:07:13,140 --> 03:07:15,260
Jump jump time!

5578
03:07:15,700 --> 03:07:16,580
Jump!

5579
03:07:16,800 --> 03:07:17,260
Jump!

5580
03:07:19,320 --> 03:07:19,760
Yeah!

5581
03:07:21,880 --> 03:07:25,440
Oh, there's animal statues!

5582
03:07:25,780 --> 03:07:26,520
Look, look, look!

5583
03:07:28,460 --> 03:07:30,740
Look, this is Ditto.

5584
03:07:32,220 --> 03:07:33,100
Look

5585
03:07:37,150 --> 03:07:38,170
at her!

5586
03:07:57,050 --> 03:07:58,510
What is so funny?

5587
03:08:05,330 --> 03:08:07,890
Film it, film it, film it!

5588
03:08:09,490 --> 03:08:10,930
That's the wrong one!

5589
03:08:32,920 --> 03:08:35,620
No, who has the D-Fim?

5590
03:08:35,720 --> 03:08:36,760
Give me the D-Fim!

5591
03:08:38,860 --> 03:08:41,040
I can't drop the D-Fim!

5592
03:08:52,860 --> 03:08:53,860
Are you alright?

5593
03:08:54,080 --> 03:08:54,720
No!

5594
03:08:55,580 --> 03:08:55,900
No!

5595
03:08:56,140 --> 03:08:56,780
No!

5596
03:08:57,320 --> 03:08:58,680
Why did I laugh?

5597
03:08:59,020 --> 03:09:00,540
Why did I laugh?

5598
03:09:00,720 --> 03:09:01,580
We died.

5599
03:09:01,780 --> 03:09:02,840
We died.

5600
03:09:03,120 --> 03:09:03,900
I'm flying!

5601
03:09:04,800 --> 03:09:05,440
I'm flying!

5602
03:09:08,560 --> 03:09:10,560
We're all sick!

5603
03:09:11,420 --> 03:09:12,420
Oh, no!

5604
03:09:13,040 --> 03:09:14,560
We're looking at the camera.

5605
03:09:14,820 --> 03:09:16,460
It's okay, I think we have the camera.

5606
03:09:16,640 --> 03:09:17,740
We have the camera.

5607
03:09:19,820 --> 03:09:20,140
Oh, really?

5608
03:09:21,860 --> 03:09:23,000
Oh my god.

5609
03:09:23,220 --> 03:09:23,920
We can get one.

5610
03:09:25,040 --> 03:09:26,800
That one is a curse.

5611
03:09:26,980 --> 03:09:31,860
If someone is 14, you have to give them a bunny one.

5612
03:09:32,380 --> 03:09:33,780
No, it was the duck.

5613
03:09:34,080 --> 03:09:35,280
It was the duck that...

5614
03:09:35,780 --> 03:09:37,720
I got the bunny, but...

5615
03:09:37,720 --> 03:09:39,800
No, it was the duck statue.

5616
03:09:40,140 --> 03:09:40,460
I don't know why.

5617
03:09:40,520 --> 03:09:41,900
You picked the wrong statue.

5618
03:09:41,900 --> 03:09:45,000
It was the duck statue that...

5619
03:09:45,640 --> 03:09:46,460
I see now!

5620
03:09:46,480 --> 03:09:48,660
The bunny was the curse.

5621
03:09:50,360 --> 03:09:52,480
The bunny was the curse.

5622
03:09:55,440 --> 03:09:56,780
We don't have money.

5623
03:09:57,680 --> 03:09:59,680
Oh, this is the other video.

5624
03:09:59,880 --> 03:10:00,360
We have one.

5625
03:10:00,720 --> 03:10:02,420
Okay, okay, okay.

5626
03:10:02,780 --> 03:10:05,180
We need money.

5627
03:10:05,360 --> 03:10:05,920
Yeah.

5628
03:10:08,320 --> 03:10:09,440
Insert it.

5629
03:10:11,740 --> 03:10:13,040
I can't insert it.

5630
03:10:13,140 --> 03:10:13,540
Wait, what?

5631
03:10:14,020 --> 03:10:14,760
Let's try.

5632
03:10:14,760 --> 03:10:15,920
Let's try.

5633
03:10:17,300 --> 03:10:17,820
Okay.

5634
03:10:19,040 --> 03:10:19,560
Oh.

5635
03:10:21,480 --> 03:10:22,000
Oh.

5636
03:10:23,240 --> 03:10:24,020
Oh, fuck.

5637
03:10:25,900 --> 03:10:26,420
Oh.

5638
03:10:26,680 --> 03:10:27,200
No.

5639
03:10:27,600 --> 03:10:28,840
Take our video.

5640
03:10:28,960 --> 03:10:29,220
No!

5641
03:10:29,800 --> 03:10:30,300
No!

5642
03:10:31,880 --> 03:10:33,160
Okay, maybe next day.

5643
03:10:34,160 --> 03:10:35,200
Okay, maybe.

5644
03:10:35,860 --> 03:10:36,720
Next day.

5645
03:10:36,860 --> 03:10:40,280
Okay, put it here.

5646
03:10:40,980 --> 03:10:41,920
Who has it?

5647
03:10:42,020 --> 03:10:42,560
Oh, I do.

5648
03:10:43,320 --> 03:10:44,360
My hand is stuck.

5649
03:10:44,540 --> 03:10:45,240
Okay, there you go.

5650
03:10:46,580 --> 03:10:46,940
Okay.

5651
03:10:48,380 --> 03:10:48,740
Okay.

5652
03:10:48,740 --> 03:10:49,820
Oh my god, I'm stuck.

5653
03:10:51,700 --> 03:10:52,420
Okay, there you go.

5654
03:10:52,480 --> 03:10:52,900
I got it.

5655
03:10:55,300 --> 03:10:56,480
Oh, I got it.

5656
03:10:56,520 --> 03:10:58,440
Oh, but that was converted a while ago.

5657
03:10:58,680 --> 03:10:59,040
Right?

5658
03:10:59,120 --> 03:11:00,120
That one was converted a while ago.

5659
03:11:00,120 --> 03:11:01,240
No, that was converted yesterday.

5660
03:11:01,860 --> 03:11:03,220
It's because you crashed.

5661
03:11:06,160 --> 03:11:07,740
I don't think it was...

5662
03:11:07,740 --> 03:11:10,060
It saved the crash at Slayers.

5663
03:11:10,120 --> 03:11:10,300
Oh, I know.

5664
03:11:10,300 --> 03:11:13,100
Oh, someone said the crash could erase it.

5665
03:11:13,360 --> 03:11:13,840
Oh, someone said the crash could erase it.

5666
03:11:13,840 --> 03:11:13,840
No!

5667
03:11:14,140 --> 03:11:15,360
Did it actually?

5668
03:11:17,140 --> 03:11:18,480
Oh, the crash erased...

5669
03:11:19,160 --> 03:11:20,060
Oh, it's offline.

5670
03:11:20,280 --> 03:11:20,720
It's offline.

5671
03:11:21,020 --> 03:11:22,140
Yeah, you can't see it now.

5672
03:11:23,840 --> 03:11:25,880
Okay, let's get the video camera.

5673
03:11:26,160 --> 03:11:26,500
Okay, okay.

5674
03:11:27,780 --> 03:11:29,680
Oh my god, we have nothing.

5675
03:11:31,360 --> 03:11:31,880
It's okay.

5676
03:11:31,960 --> 03:11:32,840
We'll check again.

5677
03:11:33,420 --> 03:11:34,700
We'll check again later.

5678
03:11:35,040 --> 03:11:36,500
We just need a big monster.

5679
03:11:36,500 --> 03:11:39,040
A big monster and then we'll be famous.

5680
03:11:40,160 --> 03:11:41,100
Can I... Can I...

5681
03:11:41,100 --> 03:11:42,860
Yeah, big monster.

5682
03:11:44,560 --> 03:11:45,240
Gotcha!

5683
03:11:47,040 --> 03:11:47,720
Yes.

5684
03:11:48,500 --> 03:11:49,180
Okay.

5685
03:11:49,540 --> 03:11:50,220
Okay.

5686
03:11:50,640 --> 03:11:52,920
Film a good video.

5687
03:11:53,180 --> 03:11:54,300
Oh, it's here.

5688
03:11:56,280 --> 03:11:56,960
Ganbatte!

5689
03:11:58,000 --> 03:11:58,680
What?

5690
03:11:58,940 --> 03:11:59,440
Is it here?

5691
03:12:01,820 --> 03:12:03,700
We can get it back.

5692
03:12:04,020 --> 03:12:04,440
Yeah.

5693
03:12:06,500 --> 03:12:08,180
Hey, it didn't spawn.

5694
03:12:10,240 --> 03:12:11,420
I believe in us.

5695
03:12:14,100 --> 03:12:15,080
We can do it.

5696
03:12:15,280 --> 03:12:16,100
It's not too far.

5697
03:12:18,000 --> 03:12:20,080
How do you know where the camera is?

5698
03:12:20,260 --> 03:12:20,620
You know?

5699
03:12:21,420 --> 03:12:23,240
It's landing here, right?

5700
03:12:23,400 --> 03:12:23,880
Oh!

5701
03:12:24,260 --> 03:12:26,580
It's landing here.

5702
03:12:26,720 --> 03:12:26,780
Oh!

5703
03:12:30,620 --> 03:12:32,520
We should have died here, right?

5704
03:12:34,680 --> 03:12:35,420
It's landing.

5705
03:12:35,760 --> 03:12:36,360
It's landing.

5706
03:12:36,500 --> 03:12:37,380
I think it's landing.

5707
03:12:38,760 --> 03:12:39,320
Eh?

5708
03:12:39,700 --> 03:12:40,680
It's not here.

5709
03:12:40,960 --> 03:12:42,140
Where did she die?

5710
03:12:42,360 --> 03:12:43,600
I died like here.

5711
03:12:43,820 --> 03:12:45,680
But it would light up.

5712
03:12:45,700 --> 03:12:47,200
It would show the camera.

5713
03:12:47,820 --> 03:12:51,880
I think it's the other exit.

5714
03:12:52,200 --> 03:12:53,620
Yeah, maybe it's in the other exit.

5715
03:12:54,180 --> 03:12:55,160
Let's just explore.

5716
03:12:56,680 --> 03:12:57,420
Explore time!

5717
03:12:57,920 --> 03:12:58,160
Let's go.

5718
03:12:59,360 --> 03:13:01,160
We need to find big monsters.

5719
03:13:02,160 --> 03:13:02,960
Nan-chan!

5720
03:13:03,020 --> 03:13:03,600
Nan-chan!

5721
03:13:03,640 --> 03:13:03,980
Hi!

5722
03:13:04,320 --> 03:13:05,200
Where's Nan-chan?

5723
03:13:06,500 --> 03:13:06,920
Nan -chan is here.

5724
03:13:06,980 --> 03:13:07,840
We need to wait for Hiro.

5725
03:13:08,060 --> 03:13:10,000
I was like, what do you mean?

5726
03:13:10,260 --> 03:13:11,180
She's here.

5727
03:13:11,500 --> 03:13:13,940
Wrong cat.

5728
03:13:14,280 --> 03:13:14,800
Wrong cat.

5729
03:13:15,760 --> 03:13:17,660
I couldn't see the face.

5730
03:13:20,860 --> 03:13:21,460
Alright.

5731
03:13:21,760 --> 03:13:22,560
There's no monsters.

5732
03:13:25,260 --> 03:13:25,860
Oh!

5733
03:13:25,880 --> 03:13:26,700
The tongue!

5734
03:13:26,840 --> 03:13:27,440
Goodbye!

5735
03:13:30,500 --> 03:13:31,100
Goodbye!

5736
03:13:32,140 --> 03:13:34,360
Give us camera!

5737
03:13:34,520 --> 03:13:34,880
Give us camera!

5738
03:13:36,500 --> 03:13:37,740
If you die, give us camera!

5739
03:13:38,640 --> 03:13:39,120
Alright.

5740
03:13:39,940 --> 03:13:40,740
Oh, that's me.

5741
03:13:41,820 --> 03:13:42,580
Look at her.

5742
03:13:43,560 --> 03:13:44,200
Throw the camera!

5743
03:13:44,320 --> 03:13:44,840
Throw the camera!

5744
03:13:46,960 --> 03:13:47,440
Oh!

5745
03:13:51,590 --> 03:13:52,550
Did she...

5746
03:13:53,050 --> 03:13:53,530
Ah!

5747
03:14:11,920 --> 03:14:12,800
Oh, shit!

5748
03:14:12,980 --> 03:14:13,680
Oh, no!

5749
03:14:15,360 --> 03:14:16,720
I was throwing the camera!

5750
03:14:18,240 --> 03:14:18,720
Nice!

5751
03:14:19,820 --> 03:14:20,720
We did it!

5752
03:14:20,780 --> 03:14:21,260
We did it!

5753
03:14:23,280 --> 03:14:23,720
Laser!

5754
03:14:23,800 --> 03:14:24,060
Laser!

5755
03:14:24,120 --> 03:14:24,340
Laser!

5756
03:14:24,400 --> 03:14:24,620
Laser!

5757
03:14:25,580 --> 03:14:26,580
We go this way.

5758
03:14:27,920 --> 03:14:28,360
Here.

5759
03:14:28,720 --> 03:14:29,300
Do you have to hold?

5760
03:14:30,380 --> 03:14:30,820
Okay!

5761
03:14:33,960 --> 03:14:34,920
Hiro, where are you?

5762
03:14:36,860 --> 03:14:37,300
Wow!

5763
03:14:38,360 --> 03:14:38,800
Scary!

5764
03:14:40,880 --> 03:14:41,680
So scared.

5765
03:14:43,180 --> 03:14:45,300
Yeah, how come now there's no monster?

5766
03:14:45,620 --> 03:14:45,800
Oh!

5767
03:14:47,500 --> 03:14:48,620
What monster is that?

5768
03:14:48,920 --> 03:14:50,400
Oh, it's a sabi ghost!

5769
03:14:50,400 --> 03:14:51,340
It's a sabi ghost!

5770
03:14:51,440 --> 03:14:52,040
We don't have hugs!

5771
03:15:01,190 --> 03:15:01,750
She's dead!

5772
03:15:01,790 --> 03:15:02,170
She's dead!

5773
03:15:02,290 --> 03:15:02,970
She's dead!

5774
03:15:02,990 --> 03:15:03,410
She's dead!

5775
03:15:07,290 --> 03:15:08,170
This way!

5776
03:15:08,330 --> 03:15:10,450
Oh, no!

5777
03:15:10,550 --> 03:15:11,410
Not this way!

5778
03:15:11,550 --> 03:15:11,770
No!

5779
03:15:12,210 --> 03:15:13,550
Why you follow me?

5780
03:15:16,930 --> 03:15:17,590
Oh, no!

5781
03:15:19,350 --> 03:15:19,830
It's okay.

5782
03:15:20,390 --> 03:15:21,270
I'll find a monster.

5783
03:15:21,270 --> 03:15:22,570
I'm gonna find the other camera.

5784
03:15:22,710 --> 03:15:23,390
I'm gonna be a Hiro.

5785
03:15:23,850 --> 03:15:25,150
I'm gonna be the Hiro.

5786
03:15:26,010 --> 03:15:28,250
What goes down must come up.

5787
03:15:29,490 --> 03:15:30,810
I'm gonna be the Hiro, guys.

5788
03:15:32,790 --> 03:15:33,530
F- Oh!

5789
03:15:36,630 --> 03:15:37,490
What's that sound?

5790
03:15:38,570 --> 03:15:39,790
Did you guys hear that?

5791
03:15:40,910 --> 03:15:42,270
Did you guys hear that sound?

5792
03:15:43,350 --> 03:15:43,830
Did you guys hear that sound?

5793
03:15:43,830 --> 03:15:47,600
What was that?

5794
03:15:48,300 --> 03:15:49,680
What the fuck was that?

5795
03:15:52,280 --> 03:15:53,680
What the fuck was that?

5796
03:15:53,680 --> 03:15:54,120
What was that sound?

5797
03:15:54,200 --> 03:15:55,160
You guys heard that, right?

5798
03:15:59,300 --> 03:16:00,480
It was like...

5799
03:16:04,000 --> 03:16:06,260
Where could the fucking...

5800
03:16:06,260 --> 03:16:06,500
Where could the fucking...

5801
03:16:06,500 --> 03:16:07,000
Oh my god.

5802
03:16:07,100 --> 03:16:08,100
Maybe it's over there.

5803
03:16:08,320 --> 03:16:09,600
Maybe the camera's over there.

5804
03:16:09,640 --> 03:16:10,280
I'm gonna be Hiro.

5805
03:16:10,880 --> 03:16:13,780
I'm gonna find the camera.

5806
03:16:14,320 --> 03:16:15,040
This is it.

5807
03:16:16,540 --> 03:16:17,880
They all laughed at me.

5808
03:16:19,040 --> 03:16:20,240
But I'm gonna be Hiro.

5809
03:16:20,280 --> 03:16:21,960
I'm gonna check if they're still alive though.

5810
03:16:23,960 --> 03:16:25,380
Oh, they're all dead.

5811
03:16:25,580 --> 03:16:29,080
Oh, they're all dead.

5812
03:16:30,580 --> 03:16:32,800
Guys, now we have two cameras.

5813
03:16:34,240 --> 03:16:34,340
Guys, now we have two cameras.

5814
03:16:34,340 --> 03:16:35,360
That's amazing.

5815
03:16:39,340 --> 03:16:40,860
I think we're...

5816
03:16:40,860 --> 03:16:42,580
We're pretty dead.

5817
03:16:43,120 --> 03:16:44,760
Maybe the camera's here.

5818
03:16:44,920 --> 03:16:46,680
The camera has to be...

5819
03:16:47,280 --> 03:16:49,520
I'm not gonna be able to find the other camera.

5820
03:16:50,080 --> 03:16:54,120
I'm not gonna be able to find the other camera.

5821
03:16:54,200 --> 03:16:54,800
Okay.

5822
03:16:54,800 --> 03:16:57,920
The other camera has to be down here.

5823
03:16:58,340 --> 03:16:59,760
There's no other way.

5824
03:17:02,000 --> 03:17:02,620
Hello?

5825
03:17:05,420 --> 03:17:07,380
The fuck is that sound?

5826
03:17:07,460 --> 03:17:08,040
I hate it.

5827
03:17:08,080 --> 03:17:08,980
I hate that sound.

5828
03:17:13,460 --> 03:17:15,200
Where's the other camera?

5829
03:17:16,300 --> 03:17:16,920
I

5830
03:17:23,670 --> 03:17:24,370
don't like this.

5831
03:17:26,430 --> 03:17:28,730
I can't find the other camera.

5832
03:17:31,990 --> 03:17:32,610
Oh.

5833
03:17:38,830 --> 03:17:40,790
Where could the other camera be?

5834
03:17:41,990 --> 03:17:45,090
If I escape, we have two missing cameras.

5835
03:17:46,950 --> 03:17:47,450
Okay.

5836
03:17:47,870 --> 03:17:49,610
Let me double check.

5837
03:17:50,770 --> 03:17:51,650
No, no, no.

5838
03:17:51,650 --> 03:17:52,310
They're still alive.

5839
03:17:52,510 --> 03:17:53,370
She's still alive.

5840
03:17:55,770 --> 03:17:57,070
What is that sound?

5841
03:17:59,130 --> 03:18:00,030
She's still alive.

5842
03:18:00,090 --> 03:18:00,610
Look, look, look.

5843
03:18:01,990 --> 03:18:02,490
58.

5844
03:18:05,310 --> 03:18:05,990
58.

5845
03:18:05,990 --> 03:18:06,870
What is that sound?

5846
03:18:08,330 --> 03:18:09,270
She's alive.

5847
03:18:09,770 --> 03:18:10,150
She's alive.

5848
03:18:10,230 --> 03:18:11,250
I'm gonna watch this.

5849
03:18:12,830 --> 03:18:13,510
58.

5850
03:18:15,290 --> 03:18:15,970
57.

5851
03:18:19,410 --> 03:18:20,510
She's getting closer.

5852
03:18:20,830 --> 03:18:21,090
She's getting closer.

5853
03:18:21,150 --> 03:18:21,830
She's getting closer.

5854
03:18:24,180 --> 03:18:26,620
Why is she just going back and forth?

5855
03:18:27,100 --> 03:18:27,700
Why is she just going back and forth?

5856
03:18:30,200 --> 03:18:31,400
I don't like this.

5857
03:18:32,360 --> 03:18:33,560
Oh no.

5858
03:18:34,800 --> 03:18:35,500
Zeno.

5859
03:18:35,500 --> 03:18:35,540
Zeno!

5860
03:18:36,180 --> 03:18:37,780
Listen to my voice!

5861
03:18:40,600 --> 03:18:43,080
Why is she stuck between 59 and 58?

5862
03:18:47,010 --> 03:18:47,960
She stopped moving.

5863
03:18:51,500 --> 03:18:52,200
Ah!

5864
03:19:01,820 --> 03:19:02,800
What the?

5865
03:19:04,940 --> 03:19:06,580
What the fuck?

5866
03:19:08,180 --> 03:19:12,230
What was that?

5867
03:19:12,730 --> 03:19:14,410
What the fuck was that?

5868
03:19:15,730 --> 03:19:16,270
What the fuck?

5869
03:19:18,630 --> 03:19:21,130
What the fuck was that?

5870
03:19:25,010 --> 03:19:27,270
Oh my god.

5871
03:19:31,470 --> 03:19:32,710
And they died.

5872
03:19:32,950 --> 03:19:35,450
Guys, I don't think we're gonna get the views.

5873
03:19:35,730 --> 03:19:36,270
Oh my god.

5874
03:19:36,270 --> 03:19:37,250
Oh my god.

5875
03:19:38,690 --> 03:19:42,030
We gotta get the content tomorrow.

5876
03:19:42,350 --> 03:19:43,110
Oh my god.

5877
03:19:43,170 --> 03:19:43,730
What happened?

5878
03:19:43,830 --> 03:19:45,590
Did you die?

5879
03:19:45,730 --> 03:19:46,270
No!

5880
03:19:46,650 --> 03:19:51,350
I was with Hyl and she died and I took the camera.

5881
03:19:51,830 --> 03:19:51,850
No?

5882
03:19:52,350 --> 03:19:54,490
I was trying to get home.

5883
03:19:54,710 --> 03:19:55,650
Oh my god.

5884
03:19:56,130 --> 03:19:59,910
We need to have a really good content.

5885
03:20:00,190 --> 03:20:01,190
We need to get the camera tomorrow.

5886
03:20:01,630 --> 03:20:03,470
We need to find two cameras.

5887
03:20:04,210 --> 03:20:07,630
I don't think we can play the CD because of the crash.

5888
03:20:09,530 --> 03:20:10,650
I don't think we can play the CD because of the crash.

5889
03:20:12,390 --> 03:20:13,150
It's okay.

5890
03:20:13,150 --> 03:20:16,950
The last two days will have so much content.

5891
03:20:17,050 --> 03:20:18,030
I believe in us.

5892
03:20:18,870 --> 03:20:20,810
I believe in the last two days.

5893
03:20:20,950 --> 03:20:21,550
Guys.

5894
03:20:24,150 --> 03:20:25,070
Last day.

5895
03:20:25,150 --> 03:20:25,710
Last day.

5896
03:20:26,250 --> 03:20:27,750
We're gonna find the cameras.

5897
03:20:28,930 --> 03:20:30,530
Okay, we'll find the cameras.

5898
03:20:30,690 --> 03:20:31,070
Yeah.

5899
03:20:32,730 --> 03:20:34,810
Remember, right?

5900
03:20:34,930 --> 03:20:35,690
You died.

5901
03:20:36,270 --> 03:20:36,870
Okay.

5902
03:20:38,050 --> 03:20:38,650
Ready?

5903
03:20:38,650 --> 03:20:41,690
I think the day before is camera.

5904
03:20:48,800 --> 03:20:49,560
No!

5905
03:20:49,840 --> 03:20:50,580
It's okay.

5906
03:20:50,780 --> 03:20:53,320
The last camera, we got...

5907
03:20:53,320 --> 03:20:54,680
I believe.

5908
03:20:55,040 --> 03:20:59,940
If Nachan believes in us, I believe.

5909
03:21:01,060 --> 03:21:01,960
If Nachan believes in us, I believe.

5910
03:21:01,960 --> 03:21:02,300
If Nachan believes in us, I believe.

5911
03:21:02,300 --> 03:21:02,740
Nachan believes.

5912
03:21:02,740 --> 03:21:02,940
Nachan believes.

5913
03:21:05,860 --> 03:21:06,940
Somi believes.

5914
03:21:07,320 --> 03:21:08,900
Alright, let's go.

5915
03:21:09,480 --> 03:21:10,540
We can email when we're home.

5916
03:21:11,280 --> 03:21:14,220
We email when we're back home.

5917
03:21:19,590 --> 03:21:21,690
When we're back home, we emote.

5918
03:21:21,730 --> 03:21:21,830
When we're back home, we emote.

5919
03:21:21,950 --> 03:21:23,310
Nino, where's the camera?

5920
03:21:24,850 --> 03:21:27,350
The camera is right...

5921
03:21:30,060 --> 03:21:30,760
Okay.

5922
03:21:30,880 --> 03:21:31,280
Okay.

5923
03:21:32,520 --> 03:21:34,200
Oh, the back flip.

5924
03:21:34,720 --> 03:21:35,280
Emote.

5925
03:21:36,200 --> 03:21:37,100
Emote, views.

5926
03:21:37,460 --> 03:21:38,280
Oh, oh, oh.

5927
03:21:38,360 --> 03:21:39,120
There's Gary.

5928
03:21:41,040 --> 03:21:41,780
It's Gary.

5929
03:21:43,020 --> 03:21:44,300
Okay, okay, go, go, go.

5930
03:21:44,580 --> 03:21:45,360
It's Gary.

5931
03:21:46,480 --> 03:21:47,600
Wow, wow, baby.

5932
03:21:47,720 --> 03:21:48,440
Look at the baby.

5933
03:21:51,760 --> 03:21:52,560
Nice, nice.

5934
03:21:52,660 --> 03:21:52,660
Nice, nice.

5935
03:21:52,660 --> 03:21:54,080
The baby doesn't hurt, so you're fine.

5936
03:21:55,060 --> 03:21:56,700
I'm trying to find the camera too.

5937
03:21:58,740 --> 03:21:59,960
I found bone.

5938
03:22:04,420 --> 03:22:06,480
Alright, we should film other stuff too.

5939
03:22:06,780 --> 03:22:07,660
Um, doggie?

5940
03:22:07,800 --> 03:22:08,180
Yeah.

5941
03:22:08,520 --> 03:22:09,240
Um, um...

5942
03:22:18,400 --> 03:22:20,960
No, I mean this orb.

5943
03:22:21,620 --> 03:22:24,720
Oh, oh, wait, wait, where did it go?

5944
03:22:24,840 --> 03:22:25,400
What happened?

5945
03:22:26,260 --> 03:22:27,800
It disappeared in the light.

5946
03:22:28,080 --> 03:22:29,400
No, where did Nachan go?

5947
03:22:29,400 --> 03:22:29,760
He disappeared in the light.

5948
03:22:29,760 --> 03:22:30,320
No, where did Nachan go?

5949
03:22:30,340 --> 03:22:31,280
Nachan and Ditto go.

5950
03:22:31,840 --> 03:22:32,680
They're dead.

5951
03:22:32,980 --> 03:22:34,980
What happened?

5952
03:22:36,080 --> 03:22:36,400
What?

5953
03:22:37,280 --> 03:22:39,600
I'm gonna try and capture their body.

5954
03:22:39,740 --> 03:22:40,480
Hey, pause, pause.

5955
03:22:41,880 --> 03:22:43,540
Pause, pause, pause.

5956
03:22:44,540 --> 03:22:45,420
Oh, no!

5957
03:22:46,780 --> 03:22:47,080
Whoa!

5958
03:22:49,960 --> 03:22:50,940
Wait, I can't jump.

5959
03:22:51,460 --> 03:22:55,190
Oh, I'm coming!

5960
03:22:55,650 --> 03:22:58,310
What the fuck?

5961
03:22:58,410 --> 03:22:59,190
What the fuck?

5962
03:22:59,250 --> 03:22:59,710
He touched me!

5963
03:22:59,710 --> 03:23:00,950
Oh my god!

5964
03:23:01,230 --> 03:23:02,210
What the...

5965
03:23:02,210 --> 03:23:03,450
What?

5966
03:23:04,310 --> 03:23:05,370
What happened?

5967
03:23:06,030 --> 03:23:06,650
It's okay.

5968
03:23:07,490 --> 03:23:09,290
Maybe you'll go down.

5969
03:23:09,390 --> 03:23:10,870
I'll go back up.

5970
03:23:11,350 --> 03:23:12,370
Down is up.

5971
03:23:13,410 --> 03:23:15,170
The ghost parkour.

5972
03:23:16,530 --> 03:23:18,150
Down is up.

5973
03:23:18,870 --> 03:23:20,850
Okay, I found another...

5974
03:23:23,570 --> 03:23:25,570
I guess I'll just die forever.

5975
03:23:28,250 --> 03:23:29,690
I hope so.

5976
03:23:29,690 --> 03:23:31,490
I hope Hiro...

5977
03:23:31,490 --> 03:23:33,530
I hope Hiro...

5978
03:23:35,550 --> 03:23:35,930
Goodbye.

5979
03:23:38,610 --> 03:23:39,370
Goodbye.

5980
03:23:39,370 --> 03:23:40,390
I hope Hiro...

5981
03:23:40,390 --> 03:23:41,310
I hope Hiro...

5982
03:23:41,310 --> 03:23:42,590
fucking does this for us.

5983
03:23:42,710 --> 03:23:43,170
Fucking does this for us.

5984
03:23:46,150 --> 03:23:46,910
Goodbye.

5985
03:23:48,790 --> 03:23:49,550
Goodbye.

5986
03:23:52,470 --> 03:23:54,090
Is that it or not?

5987
03:23:54,230 --> 03:23:55,030
Is that it?

5988
03:23:55,030 --> 03:23:56,310
Wait, I...

5989
03:23:56,310 --> 03:23:57,570
Are we all dead?

5990
03:23:58,310 --> 03:24:00,350
Doki Doki, we got a ride to the help pit.

5991
03:24:00,530 --> 03:24:00,990
Our

5992
03:24:09,270 --> 03:24:11,010
careers...

5993
03:24:11,010 --> 03:24:11,250
No!

5994
03:24:14,160 --> 03:24:14,880
Oh my gosh.

5995
03:24:15,220 --> 03:24:17,160
We didn't even win Viall.

5996
03:24:18,060 --> 03:24:18,540
Shame!

5997
03:24:19,000 --> 03:24:23,280
Oh, thank god.

5998
03:24:23,480 --> 03:24:24,720
It was just a bad dream.

5999
03:24:26,320 --> 03:24:27,760
Okay, we're still alive.

6000
03:24:27,980 --> 03:24:29,760
Oh, GG's.

6001
03:24:32,360 --> 03:24:33,180
GG's, everybody.

6002
03:24:34,300 --> 03:24:35,040
GG's, everybody.

6003
03:24:35,060 --> 03:24:36,120
GG's.

6004
03:24:36,120 --> 03:24:37,520
I had a lot of fun.

6005
03:24:38,200 --> 03:24:38,800
GG's.

6006
03:24:40,240 --> 03:24:40,840
GG's.

6007
03:24:40,840 --> 03:24:43,140
Yeah, woo!

6008
03:24:44,600 --> 03:24:45,460
GG's, guys.

6009
03:24:45,940 --> 03:24:47,100
That was so fun!

6010
03:24:47,640 --> 03:24:47,880
Yeah.

6011
03:24:48,960 --> 03:24:50,060
Oh my god.

6012
03:24:50,720 --> 03:24:51,880
Oh my god, do you guys know?

6013
03:24:52,100 --> 03:24:55,500
Wait, you guys are all good at Apex too, right?

6014
03:24:55,780 --> 03:24:57,700
Cause Ditto's also Apex Pred.

6015
03:24:59,240 --> 03:24:59,740
Yeah!

6016
03:24:59,940 --> 03:25:00,860
We're like...

6017
03:25:02,720 --> 03:25:04,320
We're all... we're all...

6018
03:25:06,380 --> 03:25:07,440
We're all Apex gamers.

6019
03:25:07,960 --> 03:25:08,580
Wait, you two also play Apex?

6020
03:25:08,760 --> 03:25:09,300
Yeah, yeah.

6021
03:25:10,740 --> 03:25:11,900
Four of us.

6022
03:25:11,900 --> 03:25:12,500
All four.

6023
03:25:13,380 --> 03:25:13,980
Really?

6024
03:25:14,480 --> 03:25:15,940
Yeah, they're masters.

6025
03:25:16,520 --> 03:25:17,640
Let's play next time.

6026
03:25:18,180 --> 03:25:21,060
Yeah, I'll stream snipe you guys.

6027
03:25:21,400 --> 03:25:21,980
We've fought it.

6028
03:25:22,100 --> 03:25:23,680
Yeah, yeah, I'll stream snipe.

6029
03:25:24,300 --> 03:25:25,040
Oh yeah!

6030
03:25:26,140 --> 03:25:30,060
No, we are not scared of Doki because she's noob.

6031
03:25:30,060 --> 03:25:30,520
What?

6032
03:25:31,460 --> 03:25:32,060
What?

6033
03:25:35,060 --> 03:25:35,400
That's fucked up.

6034
03:25:35,960 --> 03:25:36,920
I'm gonna kill you.

6035
03:25:38,100 --> 03:25:38,580
Yeah.

6036
03:25:40,220 --> 03:25:42,280
I'm waiting for you to stream snipe, okay?

6037
03:25:42,460 --> 03:25:43,360
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

6038
03:25:43,360 --> 03:25:44,800
You three queue together.

6039
03:25:45,120 --> 03:25:46,740
If you snipe me, I will kill you.

6040
03:25:46,900 --> 03:25:48,440
Okay, okay, you three queue together.

6041

I'm a cute skater.

6044
03:25:53,340 --> 03:25:55,260
Okay, okay, I'll kill all of you.

6045
03:25:55,680 --> 03:25:55,940
I'm waiting for you to snipe.

6046
03:26:00,640 --> 03:26:01,340
GG's, guys.

03:26:01,340 --> 03:26:03,520
I had lots of fun.

6048
03:26:05,680 --> 03:26:06,160
GG's.

6049
03:26:06,160 --> 03:26:06,900
Our end of stream.

6050
03:26:07,680 --> 03:26:08,920
Bye bye, guys.

6051
03:26:09,200 --> 03:26:10,580
I'm gonna talk to my chat.

03:26:10,920 --> 03:26:12,460
Thank you for joining.

03:26:13,480 --> 03:26:14,680
Thank you, guys.

03:26:15,360 --> 03:26:16,380
Nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you guys.

6056
03:26:17,780 --> 03:26:18,720
Nice to meet you, Nachan.

03:26:19,220 --> 03:26:20,560
Nice to meet you.

6058
03:26:21,180 --> 03:26:21,660
Yeah.

6059
03:26:22,440 --> 03:26:24,120
Okay, okay, okay.

6060
03:26:25,600 --> 03:26:27,340
Okay, I'll kill you guys in Apex.

6061
03:26:27,380 --> 03:26:27,700
Okay?

6062
03:26:27,920 --> 03:26:28,380
Okay.

6063
03:26:29,380 --> 03:26:30,420
Okay, bye bye.

6064
03:26:31,340 --> 03:26:31,780

Oh, wait.

6067
03:26:40,940 --> 03:26:42,240
Okay, that was...

6068
03:26:42,240 --> 03:26:43,000
That was fun.

6069
03:26:43,380 --> 03:26:44,700
Let me swap real fast.

6070
03:26:45,120 --> 03:26:47,400
That was... Oh, I had a great time.

6071
03:26:47,580 --> 03:26:51,520
I had a great time playing with Ditto, Hiro, and Nachan.

6072
03:26:55,880 --> 03:26:56,980
It was great.

6073
03:26:57,100 --> 03:26:59,720
I hope you guys had a fun time meeting Hiro and Nachan.

6074
03:26:59,720 --> 03:27:03,360
I'm really happy to be able to collab with them.

6075
03:27:03,760 --> 03:27:07,260
It was so fun playing Content Warning for the first time.

6076
03:27:07,480 --> 03:27:09,280
I can't believe we all...

6077
03:27:09,280 --> 03:27:14,820
I can't believe I was the last hope and I got fucking sucked up by the fucking tongue.

6078
03:27:16,800 --> 03:27:19,180
But, oh my god, it's been three hours.

6079
03:27:19,400 --> 03:27:22,180
I didn't realize we've been playing Content Warning for three hours now.

6080
03:27:23,820 --> 03:27:24,380
Um...

6081
03:27:24,380 --> 03:27:25,800
Um... But yeah, bro.

6082
03:27:26,020 --> 03:27:28,920
Content Warning has to be so hard to audio balance.

6083
03:27:29,060 --> 03:27:33,040
I didn't realize how hard it was to audio balance Content Warning.

6084
03:27:33,220 --> 03:27:34,180
It was such a...

6085
03:27:34,180 --> 03:27:35,700
Uh... It was so...

6086
03:27:35,700 --> 03:27:36,800
Like, the echo.

6087
03:27:37,040 --> 03:27:39,160
I wish you could like, turn down the echo.

6088
03:27:39,600 --> 03:27:41,180
I can't believe it.

6089
03:27:41,220 --> 03:27:43,320
You can't turn down the echo for that.

6090
03:27:43,480 --> 03:27:44,160
It's crazy.

6091
03:27:44,700 --> 03:27:45,220
Yeah.

6092
03:27:47,680 --> 03:27:48,200
Yeah.

6093
03:27:49,020 --> 03:27:51,260
But it was still really, really, really fun.

6094
03:27:51,480 --> 03:27:53,140
I hope your ears are okay, chat.

6095
03:27:53,360 --> 03:27:56,000
I hope your ears are okay.

6096
03:27:56,120 --> 03:27:57,160
Cause that was...

6097
03:27:58,960 --> 03:28:01,040
That was a lot of screaming.

6098
03:28:04,700 --> 03:28:05,300
Um...

6099
03:28:05,300 --> 03:28:05,480
Um...

6100
03:28:06,140 --> 03:28:08,400
But, thank you all for joining.

6101
03:28:08,840 --> 03:28:13,560
Um, it was amazing playing with Jiro, Nachan, and Hiro.

6102
03:28:13,740 --> 03:28:16,100
I really enjoyed my time with them.

6103
03:28:16,340 --> 03:28:17,740
Um, I wanted to...

6104
03:28:17,740 --> 03:28:19,020
I'm so tired.

6105
03:28:19,260 --> 03:28:23,600
I'm so tired from laughing, um, and screaming, and everything.

6106
03:28:23,840 --> 03:28:26,520
But it was, uh, a great time.

6107
03:28:26,780 --> 03:28:28,760
And... Oh, you guys have had a fun time too.

6108
03:28:28,900 --> 03:28:30,580
Uh, meeting them for the first time.

6109
03:28:30,760 --> 03:28:34,380
Um, my brain is fried right now, so I can't form sentences properly.

6110
03:28:36,060 --> 03:28:37,760
My brain is so fried.

6111
03:28:38,200 --> 03:28:39,180
Oh, oh!

6112
03:28:39,340 --> 03:28:40,260
A little update!

6113
03:28:40,460 --> 03:28:41,320
A little update.

6114
03:28:41,540 --> 03:28:44,400
Uh, I think I was talking to like the Minecraft people.

6115
03:28:44,880 --> 03:28:51,920
Um, but basically next week, um, we might have the dragoons members Minecraft server.

6116
03:28:52,220 --> 03:28:53,980
So, they said like around...

6117
03:28:53,980 --> 03:28:58,220
It would be like around next week or like a little bit after next week.

6118
03:28:58,340 --> 03:29:03,600
So, I'm super, super excited, um, to have the Minecraft server soon.

6119
03:29:03,840 --> 03:29:05,220
Uh, for you dragoons.

6120
03:29:05,480 --> 03:29:11,400
Um, it's gonna be members only, but I'll be streaming the server itself public because of the rules.

6121
03:29:11,520 --> 03:29:11,800
You know?

6122
03:29:11,980 --> 03:29:13,580
The Minecraft rules.

6123
03:29:14,260 --> 03:29:14,780
Um...

6124
03:29:15,340 --> 03:29:17,940
It says that, uh, you can like...

6125
03:29:17,940 --> 03:29:20,300
You can like stream Minecraft with a paywall.

6126
03:29:20,480 --> 03:29:22,880
So, the server itself will be streamed publicly.

6127
03:29:23,160 --> 03:29:24,520
Uh, to showcase around.

6128
03:29:24,760 --> 03:29:25,700
And then, um...

6129
03:29:26,720 --> 03:29:27,160
Um...

6130
03:29:28,380 --> 03:29:32,060
The server itself can only be accessed by members.

6131
03:29:32,360 --> 03:29:35,140
So, uh, just to let you guys know in advance.

6132
03:29:35,340 --> 03:29:38,000
But I'm super, super excited because it's gonna be like an SMP type deal.

6133
03:29:38,160 --> 03:29:40,020
Um, with like custom stuff on it.

6134
03:29:40,160 --> 03:29:40,960
Anyway, guys!

6135
03:29:41,180 --> 03:29:42,620
My brain is super, super fried.

6136
03:29:42,680 --> 03:29:44,340
So, I'm gonna call it here, everybody.

6137
03:29:45,140 --> 03:29:45,580
Uh...

6138
03:29:45,580 --> 03:29:47,960
As always, everyone, stay hydrated.

6139
03:29:48,540 --> 03:29:49,240
Posture check.

6140
03:29:49,380 --> 03:29:51,700
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

6141
03:29:51,920 --> 03:29:54,900
And if you stay up for me, head to bed because you deserve it!

6142
03:29:54,980 --> 03:29:55,700
I'll see you guys next time!

6143
03:29:55,720 --> 03:29:55,940
Everybody!

6144
03:29:56,140 --> 03:29:56,720
