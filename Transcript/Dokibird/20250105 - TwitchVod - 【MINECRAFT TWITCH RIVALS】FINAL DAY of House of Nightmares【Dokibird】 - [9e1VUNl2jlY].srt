1
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,190
Wait, where am I?

2
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,770
Why am I not on the screen?

3
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,190
Oh, there I am!

4
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,850
What a way to start.

5
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,190
Where am I?

6
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,430
I feel like a fucking lost grandparent.

7
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:04,890
Being like, kids, where is Grandoki?

8
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,290
Oh my god, let me turn down...

9
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,710
Great news, I'm turning down Void.

10
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,510
I'm turning down all the voices for the next game.

11
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,910
Oh my god, the Golden Kappa train?

12
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,830
Wait, isn't that rare?

13
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,790
Guys, we hit the rare Golden Kappa!

14
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,230
Hiketrain!

15
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,850
That's rare, right?

16
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,050
Oh my god, we've been blessed.

17
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:40,070
We've been blessed today for day 4 of the Minecraft Twitch Rivals.

18
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:41,850
They have blessed us.

19
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:48,510
Also, sound guy, if you're here, I'm gonna need you to let me know if the sound's gonna be messed up or not.

20
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,670
Guys, okay, here's some updates.

21
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:51,890
Oh my god, thank you!

22
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,130
Oh my god!

23
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:54,930
That's so many!

24
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,030
Oh, so many subs!

25
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,090
Thank you, everybody!

26
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:03,370
PTD, thank you for the five gifted subs!

27
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,650
Oh, that's so many!

28
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:05,690
It's Golden Kappa!

29
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,770
It's your time to get a Golden Kappa!

30
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,290
Thank you for the bitties, Mackie!

31
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,590
Okay, after I get eliminated, I'll thank everybody.

32
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,250
I'll pull up the list.

33
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,170
I don't have the list.

34
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:18,390
It's not a hit list.

35
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,450
It's not a hit list.

36
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:24,090
It's like the list of people who gifted and subbed and all that stuff.

37
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,770
I don't have it up right now.

38
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:34,190
But after we get eliminated in the doll game, I'll pull it up.

39
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,870
Because it's going so fast.

40
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,830
Nexie, thank you for the five gifted subs!

41
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:38,230
Thank you!

42
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:38,890
Thank you!

43
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,270
And Karin, thank you for the 200 bitties!

44
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:42,450
Alright, guys.

45
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,590
This is crazy.

46
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,730
It's actually crazy.

47
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:53,790
But after the stream ended, I think for like four hours, they kept arguing.

48
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:54,910
It was...

49
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:07,970
I think for like four to five hours, after we thought it was over, people reignited the argument in the Discord chat.

50
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:11,730
It was actually insane.

51
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,270
You know what happened?

52
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,270
One of the admins posted an update.

53
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:21,150
And then it reignited the conversation.

54
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:25,370
And then they started pulling up actually rules and stuff.

55
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:35,710
They're like, you said in this rule that players who don't follow the rules because they were ignorant doesn't count.

56
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,710
And then they pulled that rule up.

57
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,090
Because it was so funny.

58
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,150
Oh my...

59
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,390
I read that and it was so funny.

60
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,890
I was like, oh my god.

61
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,250
I need to see this again.

62
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,950
Because it was actually...

63
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:00,590
I was like, what the heck?

64
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:04,650
Okay, being...

65
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,210
This is a real rule, by the way.

66
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:12,290
Being unaware of the rules does not exempt participants from elimination.

67
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:17,170
Organizers reserve their right to enforce rules and take necessary actions.

68
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,950
So that is like a legit rule in the server for the game.

69
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:25,690
So then somebody took that and was like, why does this not apply now?

70
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,580
So people...

71
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,120
And then everyone was like, wait, you're right.

72
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,580
So people took that rule to use it against the admins.

73
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,920
Because they're like, you wrote this rule.

74
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:49,100
So those players who were unaware of those rules should not... is not exempt participants.

75
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,620
I was just like, what?

76
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,280
Why are we dragging...

77
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,820
Bro, it's day 5, day 4.

78
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,300
Why are we dragging this back up?

79
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,820
I thought we all agreed.

80
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,120
I thought all of us agreed on it.

81
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,680
What do you mean?

82
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:12,440
The arguments ended at like 8pm.

83
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,940
Everybody stopped arguing at 8pm.

84
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:28,240
Because the admins dropped the rules for they dropped the rules for like game... what was it?

85
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,060
Game 6 and 7.

86
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,520
Is it 6 and 7?

87
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,100
Yeah, they dropped the rules for game 6.

88
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:35,820
Oh my gosh.

89
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,560
There's a specific... I don't even know if we're going to make it to the second game today.

90
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:47,400
Because the first game today is the first game is going to be the doll game.

91
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,720
Our favorite game, by the way.

92
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,960
It's going to be It's going to be the doll game.

93
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:59,380
There's going to be no time limit and it only stops each round after 6 players are eliminated.

94
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:06,500
So like, yeah each doll... the doll has to eliminate 6 players and there's no time limit until 6 players are dead.

95
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,140
And then we go to the second round.

96
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,480
Until 30 players are eliminated in the end.

97
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:16,760
So we're going until 30 players are eliminated so that we have 40 players left in the game.

98
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,020
Yeah, so like each round has at least 6 eliminations.

99
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,020
So, or at most 6 eliminations.

100
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,560
So like, that's how they're going.

101
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,100
They removed the safe dolls!

102
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,360
Yay!

103
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:31,680
Finally!

104
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,900
They removed the safe dolls.

105
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,920
Because there was no point.

106
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:42,340
Apparently the safe dolls was like, it was bad to hit the safe dolls.

107
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,640
Then why the heck were they called safe?

108
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,640
If it was so bad why did you name the safe dolls safe?

109
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:55,740
Because the safe dolls actually made the curse dolls faster.

110
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,900
So when you hit the safe dolls, you're just making the curse dolls move faster.

111
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,060
So I was like, wait, then it shouldn't be called safe.

112
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,320
Like, what?

113
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,140
That like, messed me up.

114
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,000
That like, actually messed me up.

115
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,860
I was like, wait, what's the point then?

116
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,700
Why did they call it safe?

117
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,940
Okay, let's like, mute.

118
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,940
I don't want to listen to the voices today, for now.

119
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,060
We'll listen to the voices when we have to run.

120
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,860
So they removed it.

121
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,840
Oh my god, golden kappa level 12!

122
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,780
Thank you for the level 12 kappa train!

123
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:36,320
Okay, I like, wrote down everything I wanted to say today about the updates.

124
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,260
Alright, okay.

125
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:52,040
And then, after they dropped the new rules, after they dropped the new rules, all the pro minecraft players started theorycrafting, and talking about like, infinity sprint jump, and then I'm like, what the heck is infinity?

126
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,080
They're like, can we do infinity sprint jump?

127
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,320
And I'm like, what the?

128
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,460
What words are they speaking?

129
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,660
Excuse me.

130
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:13,760
And then, cause the second game, like, there's no point in explaining the second game, because I don't even know if I'm gonna...

131
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,060
The dolls are gonna kill 6 people.

132
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,500
Like, for a round.

133
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,860
Like, 30 people are gonna get eliminated.

134
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,720
So, all I'm saying is like, there's no point in me explaining the second game.

135
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:32,120
When there's a... like, I feel like the moment I'm eliminated, everybody's just gonna be like, oh wait, and then turn off.

136
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:56,080
LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL So I'm not gonna explain the second game until like, if I survive the second game, I'll explain it.

137
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,860
But the second game, all I'm saying when they..

138
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:14,480
the second game, so like, We have like a daily itinerary and like they post a daily they post a daily itinerary for like every game But it's like it's all in one post, but the second game had its very own channel

139
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:41,020
Like the last game the prop hunt game had a lot of rules, but the second game Had its own channel, and then it had its own Separate FAQ channel because everybody was asking questions, and I was just like oh my god Why am I reading this?

140
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:50,600
I don't even know I'm gonna make it this far Why am I reading the freaking FAQ itinerary for this?

141
00:10:51,680 --> 00:11:09,040
Yeah, so like so I just stopped reading cuz I was like why am I even why am I even reading this like I don't Even know if I'm gonna get there So people were like asking like FAQ, but like what can we do and what can we not do?

142
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:32,160
But it was just it was so interesting it's just like seeing all the minecraft pros just like trying to see what they can like I guess like exploit type deal and For like an easier game like what separates from a an actual minecraft player from a from the you know random youtuber number 13 for

143
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:52,880
It was pretty funny, I was just like reading him like what like reading the general chat to see all these people talking about the minecraft tech and Like and talk about what they they can and can't do and stuff like that.

144
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,480
I'm just like what's going on

145
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:19,360
Yeah, no, it's I it's crazy I didn't realize how how like how complicated Minecraft and also minecraft You know, I've always read about the like the minecraft stuff but being in the thick of it and listening to like the Conversations.

146
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,140
I was like, wow.

147
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:31,080
Oh my god At this point of stage one of the pro players for an FPS game will start saying slurs, but wow

148
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:50,500
And then and then they get dropped by their org but wow Wow, I don't know what's going on like what they're saying really but like wow Wait They're still arguing about yesterday.

149
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,860
Oh my gosh.

150
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:56,380
No, I like saw some of the tweets of like the fans and like

151
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:11,680
Some of the tweets on both sides and from the the things that the trending part Cuz I was like wondering like wait, are they like against or for and the people supporting it?

152
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,000
I was like, whoa

153
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:22,600
I Was like, oh my god So how old are these fans again?

154
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,120
I'm sorry.

155
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:29,520
I should that was a low blow and I was I'm sorry minecraft community But like that was that was a low blow

156
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:38,080
I'm just like how old are these children?

157
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:55,880
No No, no if you've seen some of the screen like not the screenshots But like when you drag the fans into the argument and then you see the fans are going for you on either side You know for either side.

158
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:05,680
I'm not saying like one side or the other like I'm for for either side I thought it was really funny as an outsider the as an outsider.

159
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,680
I thought it was really funny

160
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:23,920
I Think it was actually if you've seen the tweets you would know what I mean Have you seen the tweets But yeah, anyway, yeah, that's like the minecraft update for the day.

161
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,860
There's stuff that I wrote down.

162
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,420
Oh Yeah.

163
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,120
Oh, yeah.

196
00:18:28,760 --> 00:19:00,180
All i'm saying though is I shouldn't have to ask about the twitch drop Anyway, uh, so if anybody comes in here asking about twitch drop just say yes Just say yes, because the blame is not on me if we don't have it I'm, so scared gosh I'm so anxious now I bought myself a cookie from subway I was like,

197
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:06,200
I was so anxious from From this game mode.

198
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,720
I hate I hate the dog.

199
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:28,120
I hate the dolls game mode so much I think the dolls game mode is my most hated game mode Because that shit makes you even more anxious because everybody is screaming That's the worst part when everybody is screaming and you don't know what's going on So like you you're like even more freaked out

200
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:54,220
When the voices take over yeah Yeah, when the when the voices take over and you're just like please I like I turned down the voice for everybody Buy a lot Oh Yeah, I should turn up goomy and you'll find goomy on here because like my sound guy was just like just turn up goomy and turn everybody down since you talk to her the most I Was like that's so smart.

201
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,240

202
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,240

Okay All right.

206
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:04,380
We'll turn her up All right, because then that makes sense though.

207
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,780
That actually makes sense the map of where they all are.

208
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:17,220
Yeah But yeah, that's the update for today if we live past the That we've lived past the dolls event then like god is real

209
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:41,920
God is real and they try to play a sick joke What if you don't know way All i'm saying is if I If I live this is this is the this is me Oh my god, this is me.

210
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,060
We- the last three remaining D's.

211
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:49,920
The last three D's of the- of everywhere here.

212
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:57,800
If, uh, if I don't live past the dolls event, then there is a possibility.

213
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,320
There's a pos- I can't just say God's not real.

214
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,660
Because I don't want to get into that right now.

215
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,620
There is a possibility.

216
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,180
Okay.

217
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,500
I hope- okay, I hope Gumi lives and I get eliminated.

218
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,960
So I don't get dragged into Valorant because she'll be too busy playing the next game.

219
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,420
That's like all I hope for.

220
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,300
That's all I hope for.

221
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,600
That's all I want.

222
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,880
That is a good escape plan.

223
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,460
Gumi, Gumi, Gumi!

224
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,460
Bye Apple!

225
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:48,440
Bye!

226
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:48,800
Bye!

227
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,960
No, ghost!

228
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:54,980
I'm still alive!

229
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,360
I'm still alive!

230
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,280
I can't hear a lot of things.

231
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,200
I'm scared!

232
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,560
Are you still alive?

233
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,900
My arms are numb!

234
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,520
Are you not alive?

235
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,680
I am, but people were like, oh, Doki's not alive.

236
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,800
I got one guide.

237
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,440
You got one guide.

238
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,560
I got one guide.

239
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,300
I got one guide.

240
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,580
I was worried for you, okay?

241
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,240
I got one guide, I was worried for you.

242
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,420
I'm ready.

243
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,900
I hope you make it to the next round, Gumi.

244
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,060
And then I get eliminated.

245
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,060
I hope I don't.

246
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:30,720
Why not?

247
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,140
Did you not see the next game?

248
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,220
It sounds so fun.

249
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,940
It had its own channel and everything.

250
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,460
Yeah, I saw it.

251
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,880
I also was like, wow.

252
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:45,740
I was like, wow, what happened to the RNG factor so that anybody can win?

253
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,300
They want VTuber out.

254
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,260
They want random VTuber 13 months.

255
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,700
They tried so hard to get me out.

256
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,760
What happened to that?

257
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,500
I was like, looking at it, I was like, wait, I thought...

258
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,640
I thought they would...

259
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,800
It's 10 minutes.

260
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,560
10 minutes is crazy.

261
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,400
Oh my god, alright.

262
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:13,940
So yes, the next two games are all skill-based.

263
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,060
Heavily Minecraft skill-based.

264
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,380
So I was like, what happened?

265
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,860
What happened to the RNG?

266
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,820
I thought...

267
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,820
I thought...

268
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:29,980
I thought...

269
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,780
I thought...

270
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,960
Happy pride, happy pride, happy pride, happy pride, happy pride.

271
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,580
Oh my god.

272
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,740
Okay, let me...

273
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,580
I don't... other?

274
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,840
Wait, does that mean like...

275
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,180
The volume, any sound?

276
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,920
Oh, not listed below.

277
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,120
Okay.

278
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:58,300
This is the only way.

279
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,140
There's no all button!

280
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,960
That's so messed up!

281
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,540
What is people?

282
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,780
Guys, there's no all button.

283
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,920
I have to manually do this myself.

284
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,260
I thought other was all.

285
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,620
But other are the things that are not in here.

286
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,320
Like, what is that?

287
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,240
Are you kidding me?

288
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:26,480
Okay.

289
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,300
Wait, I have an idea.

290
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,880
God, it's not players.

291
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,660
It's not players.

292
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,260
What are they?

293
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,540
What are they?

294
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:44,660
Who are they?

295
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:46,380
Okay.

296
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,100
I'll do all the Fs.

297
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,480
We're all the Fs.

298
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,600
Wait, how are they still going?

299
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,980
Oh my god.

300
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,800
Who is it?

301
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,060
Who is it?

302
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,440
I need to know their names.

303
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,460
Okay, I see the names.

304
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,900
I see the names.

305
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,020
I see the names.

306
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,520
I'm on the main screen.

307
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,020
Oh, well, the main screen's gonna see me be toxic.

308
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:32,940
I'm toxic right now.

309
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:40,940
Okay.

310
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,060
Okay, there we go.

311
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:46,920
Alright.

312
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,360
Oh my god.

313
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,860
Oh my god.

314
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,320
It feels so nice.

315
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,740
Okay, Sage is okay.

316
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,580
She's okay.

317
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,740
I'm not unmuting that.

318
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,560
I don't care what they say.

319
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,000
I don't care what anybody says.

320
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,500
Sylvie's okay.

321
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,500
If I don't know them, I'm also...

322
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,600
Oh wait, the Emmons don't even talk.

323
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,100
Okay.

324
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,300

I can hear a little bit.

327
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,500
Okay, I dare you to reveal the players.

328
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,960
Alright, I got my jersey on.

329
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,600
We're gonna win now.

330
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,020
Did you hear me?

331
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,440
You know how the lights turn off?

332
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:53,700
You know what I mean?

333
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,600
When they start?

334
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,220
I think the second they TP you, I think you can still...

335
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,760
Oh, I tried.

336
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,960
I tried that yesterday.

337
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:02,920
Did it work?

338
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,540
It didn't seem like it did.

339
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,480
But I still did it nonetheless.

340
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,140
Just to get a head start of everyone.

341
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,840
I'm gonna try and walk backwards.

342
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,980
Why did you do that Wolfie video?

343
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,720
Further away from the dolly.

344
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,360
You know what I mean?

345
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,020
Tech guys!

346
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:19,780
Minecraft tech!

347
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,840
We're stealing intel!

348
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,120
We're stealing intel!

349
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,160
It wasn't like a bet or something?

350
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,120
No, Wolfie.

351
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,020
That's insane.

352
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:35,280
Literally when you just walked up to me, I lowered every single person's volume.

353
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,560
Except the people I really know well.

354
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,680
That's so smart!

355
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,720
I don't know anybody!

356
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,140
I was like, comps are still important, but not important enough for me to get ahead.

357
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,520
But that's so smart!

358
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,160
But I don't know anybody!

359
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,720
Okay, 5UP hasn't given good intel.

360
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,680
So I'll keep 5UP up.

361
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,200
But I don't know anybody else.

362
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,280
Good luck, Gumi.

363
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,940
I hope you see you back to the next round.

364
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,620
I love you!

365
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,600
You'll save me, right Gumi?

366
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,540
You'll make sure I won't die, right?

367
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:23,720
Anyways...

368
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:33,900
I will be on the opposite side of everybody.

369
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,640
I will be wherever nobody is.

370
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,200
So we don't hear the voices.

371
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,400
It doesn't matter.

372
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,900
All I'm saying is that it doesn't matter.

373
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,180
We all get randomly TP'd.

374
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,300
We all get randomly TP'd somewhere.

375
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,580
So it doesn't matter.

376
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,200
Hello!

377
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,340
Come to my color!

378
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,300
It doesn't matter!

379
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,880
See, it's green!

380
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,040
I told you it doesn't matter!

381
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,080
Here we go.

382
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,040
Here we go.

383
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,500
Here we go.

384
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:41,060
It doesn't matter.

385
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,460
I'm just gonna follow people in the front.

386
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:48,640
This is the spot, guys.

387
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,980
This is the spot, guys.

388
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,000
This is the spot, guys.

389
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,580
Gumi's not in this group.

390
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,760
Gumi's not in this group.

391
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,780
She's not in this group.

392
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,560
We have to chill until 6 and then...

393
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,580
Gumi, where are you?

394
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,120
It's okay.

395
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,800
I'm in the middle.

396
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,840
I don't help out.

397
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:23,720
I'm just a leecher.

398
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,580
I know my place!

399
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,460
Oh, they're running!

400
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:32,900
It's not fine.

401
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,860
I heard somebody get hit.

402
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,340
It's not fine.

403
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,760
I heard people get hit.

404
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,740
You never!

405
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,580
Yo, you're tweaking!

406
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,980
Just die for us, please.

407
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,060
Straight ahead and then left.

408
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,580
We're gonna go left.

409
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,560
Left, left, left.

410
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:58,900
Oh, there's so many!

411
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,800
Right, right, right!

412
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:01,740
No!

413
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,220
He's behind us!

414
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,480
Keep running!

415
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,380
Oh my god, there's so many!

416
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:13,820
They all started running!

417
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,560
My brother, no!

418
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,200
Is it only one doll?

419
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,420
No one behind us!

420
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:30,900
There's several.

421
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,440
No one behind!

422
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,300
No!

423
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,300
So good!

424
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,880
He didn't complain at all!

425
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,400
He didn't complain at all!

426
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,500
That was scary!

427
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,380
Okay, I didn't fuck it.

428
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,640
Oh my god, do I hear the sounds?

429
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,900
I hear some sounds!

430
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:50,980
No!

431
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,840
I hear so many sounds!

432
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:01,140
Oh my god, I hear so many people!

433
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,380
That's so scary!

434
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,780
Right, right, right, right!

435
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,440
Mine, mine, mine, mine!

436
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:14,900
I'm down!

437
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,440
This is so fucking strong!

438
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,880
Mine, mine, mine!

439
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,540
Oh no...

440
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,440
Oh no, I messed up, I messed up!

441
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,700
No, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm so dead.

442
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:38,520
I'm so dead, I saw... I got confused because I thought people turned around!

443
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:43,560
Oh, people are turning around, people are turning around.

444
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,080
Oh, people are turning around.

445
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,540
Oh my god, good thing I was first and I saw it.

446
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,500
We have one behind.

447
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:51,820
Oh my god.

448
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,020
Oh, the voices are so strong.

449
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,040
No!

450
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,700
Oh, no.

451
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,080
Just keep going, just keep going.

452
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,800
I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead.

453
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,720
Oh my god, 5UP died.

454
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,060
5UP actually died.

455
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,900
Oh my god.

456
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,100
Any spot here?

457
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:12,800
Any spot here?

458
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,280
Oh my god, 5UP actually died.

459
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,760
Oh my god.

460
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,880
Oh my god, I just saw...

461
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,490
We're done, we're done, we're done.

462
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:26,670
I saw 5UP die in front of me.

463
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:30,030
I saw 5UP die in front of me.

464
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:32,910
He died next to me.

465
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:37,050
Oh my god, I made it.

466
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:38,230
I'm better than him.

467
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:46,310
I'm that VTuber.

468
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,130
Oh my god.

469
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,890
Oh my god.

470
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:59,350
That was so scary.

471
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:04,830
I claim another soul.

472
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:07,810
I claimed another soul.

473
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:17,910
If I eliminate this one, I'm fine.

474
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:18,790
I took one down.

475
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,910
I took a Minecraft probe in front of me.

476
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:22,270
I took...

477
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:24,350
I'm okay with that.

478
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:28,470
I'm actually okay with that because I took a Minecraft probe there.

479
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:37,870
I'm fine with that outcome.

480
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:39,330
I just thought that was funny.

481
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:44,570
Merch here.

482
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,710
I'm here, I'm here.

483
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:58,690
5UP died next to me.

484
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:01,430
It was me and 5UP and the doll chose him.

485
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:03,310
Oh no.

486
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:09,750
Yeah,

487
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:15,690
but I don't think they're fighting people.

488
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:16,570
I think they're just running.

489
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:21,590
Yeah, they're randomized now.

490
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:27,770
Bro, the worst part was that...

491
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:30,350
Yesterday, he would have made it.

492
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:35,950
If he didn't fought for our side to have a restart of another game.

493
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:38,950
He would have actually made it to the next round.

494
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:46,770
That's the most messed up part.

495
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:50,510
The most messed up part was that he could have made it.

496
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:52,910
If he didn't fought for us.

497
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:55,050
Oh, rest in peace, man.

498
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:56,590
Rest in peace.

499
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,750
Oh my god.

500
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:03,030
Yeah, I don't have any bombs going out.

501
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:03,430
This is bomb one.

502
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:06,530
Nobody's dying to...

503
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:07,970
Yeah, I think that's the blonde girl.

504
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:08,810
The real one.

505
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:11,950
It's not the blonde girl.

506
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:17,070
Fireball one has a pompadour.

507
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:17,910
I'm scared, I'm scared.

508
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:20,490
I think there's someone that's invisible.

509
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:24,390
No, no, no, no.

510
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:26,850
No, that is a scam.

511
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:29,810
I feel like this one has to be a troll.

512
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:30,810
There's no way.

513
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:32,930
There's no way.

514
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:37,370
It's a doll that looks like one of us.

515
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:39,470
And it's in a group and it doesn't get you until the end.

516
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:41,630
Wait, no, don't say that!

517
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,390
Okay, just stop moving.

518
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:45,510
Don't go close.

519
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:48,910
Whichever direction you moved...

520
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,670
Wally, why are you standing up right now?

521
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,630
I hear them, I hear them, I hear them.

522
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:56,750
There's no time, that's the thing.

523
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:57,650
There's no time.

524
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:58,830
Let's banish Wally there.

525
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,790
There's no time, by the way.

526
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:05,750
So, like, it only stops when six people are eliminated.

527
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:07,370
Keep talking to me, keep talking to me.

528
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:11,350
The fact that no one's died and no one's run past us probably means something.

529
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:12,990
Yeah, keep talking to me.

530
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:15,250
Wally, come on, you went to find the doll.

531
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,550
True, Gumi's doll is worth it, yeah.

532
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:19,350
I hear them.

533
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,010
Thank you, thank you, you love Kazu.

534
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:23,930
Oh my god, Scott, thank you for the raid, thank you, thank you!

535
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:26,390
This is anxiety the game right now.

536
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:29,010
I'm standing for that one, too.

537
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:32,190
I'm so scared.

538
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:36,590
I've been in a Minecraft event for the past four days.

539
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:41,330
We're all waiting, there's a doll that's gonna kill us.

540
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:44,550
And we have to survive, but the six people are dead.

541
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,070
So I'm scared.

542
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:48,850
I'm so scared.

543
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:51,790
My heart is beating.

544
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:55,930
I think everyone's in each corner.

545
00:37:57,370 --> 00:38:00,150
We're all in the corner, right?

546
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:03,330
Runners, okay, okay, we rotate slow.

547
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:05,410
Rotate slow, rotate slow.

548
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:06,790
Let's merge groups, let's merge groups.

549
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:11,690
I don't wanna be, like, in the very beginning.

550
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:14,430
This guy gave wrong comps earlier, though.

551
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:17,710
This guy was kind of giving wrong comps earlier.

552
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:20,490
That was the one time.

553
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:23,250
We'll be going down the wrong direction.

554
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,610
Run, run!

555
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:28,210
Safe, safe, safe, safe, safe.

556
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:31,290
Team behind us, team behind us, not safe.

557
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:32,150
Team behind us, not safe.

558
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:34,790
Team behind us!

559
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:35,730
No!

560
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:38,170
I can't see him!

561
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:40,770
Okay, okay.

562
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:41,810
Oh, no.

563
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:45,490
Guys, you can stop.

564
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:46,550
You can stop running.

565
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:47,670
We're not being chased.

566
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:48,470
We're fine, we're fine.

567
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:49,450
I do not believe that.

568
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:52,990
Would I ever lie to you guys?

569
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:59,470
No, if I do F5, guys, guys, if I do F5, it's worse because I'm bumped into things.

570
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:01,230
I'm directionally challenged.

571
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:02,810
They're trolling us, they're trying to troll us.

572
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:05,970
We're not trolling them.

573
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,850
Would I ever lie?

574
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:10,770
Wait, there's literally nothing lying.

575
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:14,630
What is the worst timeline ever?

576
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:15,470
I'm so confused!

577
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:18,310
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

578
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:19,410
What's going on?

579
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:21,190
Yeah, just stop.

580
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:22,810
Maybe stop next corner.

581
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:24,030
This is the best corner.

582
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:25,090
This is the best corner.

583
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,010
This is the best corner.

584
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:26,870
Right here, right here.

585
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:27,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

586
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:28,630
Oh, my God.

587
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:30,050
This group merged.

588
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:31,230
Good job, good job, guys.

589
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:31,950
Good job, good job.

590
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,310
Is this group got bigger?

591
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:35,630
Guys, I feel like everyone's here.

592
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:36,870
Chief, chief, chief.

593
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:38,410
How did this group got bigger?

594
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:41,650
Crouch, crouch, crouch, crouch.

595
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:43,350
How did this group...

596
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:46,890
We fucking get stipulated.

597
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:49,190
We have a merging group.

598
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:50,610
Simon says...

599
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:52,250
The group expansion.

600
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:53,390
They multiply.

601
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:55,430
Hi, guys.

602
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:58,030
How did this group get bigger?

603
00:39:58,530 --> 00:39:59,270
In this hallway.

604
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:01,290
You can see through the thing right there.

605
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:01,690
Just F5.

606
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,750
No, Wally, in this hallway.

607
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,390
Oh, my God.

608
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:07,210
I don't understand.

609
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:10,010
How is there more of us now?

610
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:12,890
I'm going to believe in the group.

611
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:16,690
Yeah, how is no one dead?

612
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:17,450
No.

613
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:19,710
This doll must be really bad.

614
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:22,070
Bro, we're going to be in here forever.

615
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:27,430
If the doll is not going to speed up, it's going to take forever.

616
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,330
Oh, my God.

617
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:35,490
This doll sucks.

618
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:39,470
They deleted the blonde girl that's fast.

619
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:40,510
She's not in there anymore.

620
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:41,890
Wait, they deleted her?

621
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:42,550
Why?

622
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:45,010
We want fast.

623
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:47,370
No, but the blonde boy isn't the fast one.

624
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:49,450
We want the fast one.

625
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,450
The blonde girl is the fast one.

626
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:54,330
Why would they delete the fast one?

627
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:56,310
Is it the same speed the entire round?

628
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:57,070
Or does it get faster?

629
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:57,910
I think it's the same speed.

630
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:01,350
It gets faster from round to round, but not during the round, I don't think.

631
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:05,410
Yeah, maybe if it's going to take too long, they're going to just speed it up manually.

632
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:07,730
Make it fast.

633
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:11,570
Make it so that one step is like 20 blocks.

634
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:14,570
How many times does it have to hit you?

635
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:15,590
Like a few times though, right?

636
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:16,590
Two times.

637
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:19,930
Depending on which doll it is.

638
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:23,570
The real RNG.

639
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:31,350
They made it fast now.

640
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:32,230
Here we go.

641
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:33,310
They're listening.

642
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:35,230
Oh, they're listening to us.

643
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,110
Shift, shift, shift.

644
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:36,850
Can I add that?

645
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:41,070
It'd be really cool if like the admins give us extra health.

646
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:45,350
It would be really cool if they let you put more RNG in here.

647
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:47,770
If it says you're getting hunted, then...

648
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:48,750
It would be really funny.

649
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:50,670
If I'm getting hunted, I won't say a thing, guys.

650
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:51,630
All I'm saying.

651
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,770
If I get hunted, I'm not going to say anything.

652
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:54,410
I want to...

653
00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:00,070
I'm going to be saying, I will help Elsa group.

654
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:00,370
I...

655
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:06,890
Guys, it'd be funny if they added more RNG.

656
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:09,550
Guys, don't you want to watch the underdog?

657
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:14,650
Main channel, don't you want to watch the underdog make it to the final round?

658
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:16,970
I am the underdog.

659
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:18,950
I should get more RNG.

660
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:21,850
It would be so funny.

661
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:25,410
Okay, tell me when I'm back on the main channel.

662
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:26,650
And I'm going to preach it.

663
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:30,890
I'm going to preach it if I make it to the main channel.

664
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:36,830
I thought he was the fireball one.

665
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:39,790
What is this one anyway?

666
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:46,370
Okay, I like how they increased the speed, but everybody is still alive.

667
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:48,550
So what does this one do?

668
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:52,730
He's just super strong.

669
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:58,590
Oh, that's why he...

670
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:00,270
So where is it?

671
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:09,230
0.1 If you say left, does that mean we run left?

672
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:11,570
If I say left, then that means we exceed.

673
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:13,870
If you say left, we right.

674
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:18,970
If you see it on the right, yell left.

675
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,110
If you see it on the left, yell right.

676
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:24,490
Why are we making it so complicated?

677
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:27,490
Like, why are we making...

678
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:32,830
Guys, make sure that you're rounding corners instead of going close to them.

679
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:38,070
I swear, if this messes me up, if I die because of F5, it's on you guys.

680
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:39,430
Don't keep me, don't shit.

681
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:46,290
F5, okay.

682
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:48,670
We all know my weakness.

683
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:52,490
That's what they said they were going to do, but I didn't see a single blonde girl.

684
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:57,990
Going back, abort, abort.

685
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:05,790
Where is the doll?

686
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:08,950
Increase the doll!

687
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:11,030
Increase the doll's speed!

688
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:21,990
Spawn the doll next to us.

689
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:23,310
Do it, it'll be so funny.

690
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:27,590
Wait, stop it, stop it.

691
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:30,170
Wait, can you make it reverse?

692
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:41,650
It's always hunting?

693
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:43,910
Then why are they saying the doll is at the center?

694
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:48,310
They're speeding dolls up again?

695
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:51,470
Speed the doll up and spawn one right next to us.

696
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:53,990
Spawn one doll next to each group.

697
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:56,670
It'll be so funny.

698
00:44:57,710 --> 00:45:07,810
If you want content, all I'm saying is if you want content, spawn the doll next to each group and then increase the speed.

699
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:13,550
It'll be so funny.

700
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:16,370
And then we'll get eliminated first after saying all that.

701
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:25,970
You got hunted?

702
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,770
Yeah, I did, I did, yeah, I did, I did, I did.

703
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:33,450
Oh, somebody is hunted.

704
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:37,110
Everybody is totally hunted.

705
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:44,870
Don't go too far.

706
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:48,770
What is wrong with you?

707
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:55,090
My brain is your brain now.

708
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:56,750
What is going on?

709
00:45:57,030 --> 00:46:01,870
A great migration right now.

710
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:05,770
The penguin hunters.

711
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:09,670
Wait, one person is almost more scary.

712
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:10,790
No, wow.

713
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:17,150
Why are they whispering to each other?

714
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:18,450
We can still hear you.

715
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:30,210
We don't know where the dolls are.

716
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:31,750
We don't know, nobody is dead.

717
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:35,450
We don't know.

718
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:38,330
Nobody is dead, that's the worst part.

719
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:41,270
What the heck?

720
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:43,030
Come on.

721
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:46,630
Come on, this is a betrayment.

722
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:50,430
Andres, sorry.

723
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:53,750
Gun, gun, away from him.

724
00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:54,790
Of course it was Andres.

725
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:56,590
Get over there, get over there.

726
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:02,610
Come on, speed up the dolls, speed up the dolls.

727
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:05,490
Nobody has died still, right?

728
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:06,110
Nobody has died.

729
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:09,170
Everybody is still alive.

730
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:10,070
I'm getting nervous.

731
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:12,170
I'm getting nervous.

732
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:16,070
The second round is literally just chilling.

733
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:19,030
But like, the most anxious type of chilling.

734
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:22,350
None of the groups are moving.

735
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:27,310
Wait, from all the groups, it's just like, just in the corner.

736
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:31,550
Not relaxed, but like, filled with anxiety.

737
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:34,390
Who wants to volunteer to run into the other group?

738
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:38,390
Oh my god!

739
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:39,750
It's so fast!

740
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:41,330
It's so fast!

741
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:52,710
If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands.

742
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:56,370
Come on, if you're happy and you know it, clap your hands.

743
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:57,110
Goodbye!

744
00:47:57,530 --> 00:47:57,890
Goodbye!

745
00:47:57,890 --> 00:47:58,150
Oh my god!

746
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:04,830
I'm free, I'm free.

747
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:09,110
Oh my god, where did the doll come from?

748
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:11,610
Oh my god!

749
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:14,770
It actually came from nowhere!

750
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:16,530
No!

751
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:18,950
I jinxed myself!

752
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:23,030
Oh, I didn't realize they actually listened!

753
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:24,270
They

754
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:32,350
actually listened!

755
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:34,450
Okay, look.

756
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:36,610
I said it would be funny.

757
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:40,750
But I didn't realize they spotted next to me.

758
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:46,370
Oh my god.

759
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:50,670
It actually came out of nowhere!

760
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:52,930
Holy shit!

761
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,780
The karma was real.

762
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,940
It was so real!

763
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,980
I couldn't react!

764
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:18,460
The one time, I was like, it would be so funny if they do all that.

765
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:19,580
I get hit.

766
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:24,100
I actually got hit by that.

767
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,200
That's actually insane!

768
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,940
That's actually insane!

769
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,580
Oh my god!

770
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:36,300
I did not expect that at all!

771
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:43,160
I mean, 63 out of 150, I call that a win.

772
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:46,420
Alright, Gumi needs to live.

773
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:50,220
Gumi needs to live, so I'm really free.

774
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,940
Oh my god, I don't have to...

775
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:55,320
Okay guys, I'll explain to you about game 2.

776
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:57,600
Game 2 was so messed up.

777
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,060
Game 2...

778
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:01,480
Okay, that doll was so messed up.

779
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,320
That doll was actually so fast.

780
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:06,460
Like, I was so surprised how fast it was.

781
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:08,820
It literally came out of nowhere.

782
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,700
Nobody realized it was going to come.

783
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,860
It actually came out of nowhere.

784
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:22,000
Okay, I'll explain the second game and why I was like, I hope to god I don't make it to the second game.

785
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,620
Because the second game was actually, like, skill.

786
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:27,300
Like, I was reading it.

787
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:30,780
It was actually, like, it's not even RNG anymore.

788
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,940
So it's like Hunters and...

789
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:36,680
It's like Hunters versus Prey.

790
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:40,020
So it's sort of like Prod Hunt, but there's no props.

791
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:41,300
And like Hunters...

792
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:44,100
Hunters has to get, like, it's not a team game by the way.

793
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,480
It's not a team game unless you're a Prey.

794
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:46,620
The Prey is a team game.

795
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,920
Because each Prey, Prey has to get 5 notes to survive.

796
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:58,740
If the Prey gets all 5 notes and survives, The Hunters, the Hunters with the lowest elimination will get eliminated.

797
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,640
And they have to do several rounds of that.

798
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:04,260
So like, but then there was like a lot of other stuff.

799
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:08,780
There were like a lot of other things in there too.

800
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,580
There were a lot of rules in there.

801
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:11,800
Individual rules.

802
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,400
I'm like simplifying this.

803
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,300
But it was so complicated.

804
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:21,400
So there was like...

805
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,880
It was like a more skilled game.

806
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,040
Because the third one.

807
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:28,100
The third one was full on.

808
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,320
There was a parkour.

809
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:31,020
The third game was...

810
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:32,580
I also didn't want to live to the third game.

811
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,300
Because the third game was like, there was parkour.

812
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:37,800
There was parkour.

813
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:39,360
There was a maze.

814
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:40,740
This was all in one game.

815
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,420
There was a parkour maze.

816
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,800
There was an escape room.

817
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:53,080
It's all individual.

818
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:54,960
And there's traps.

819
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:56,760
There's traps.

820
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,140
In every single objective.

821
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:01,780
But the thing is, if you die.

822
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:03,400
From each of those...

823
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,820
From any of those areas.

824
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:06,420
You get reset.

825
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:09,720
Because your team can help you in a way.

826
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:10,820
There's like...

827
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:12,960
There's like things there where you need a team.

828
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:15,020
Where you need a person to be there to help you.

829
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:16,440
So...

830
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,680
So like...

831
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:19,740
So like...

832
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:20,720
The escape room.

833
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,260
Your teammates can help you for the escape room.

834
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,860
But they can also choose to not help you as well.

835
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:28,840
Because it's all individual tasks you have to do in the escape room.

836
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:29,740
So like...

837
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:31,880
But if you die in any of them.

838
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:34,720
You get like reset to the beginning.

839
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:35,880
Of the area.

840
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:37,300
So...

841
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:38,860
So I was like...

842
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:39,220
Yeah.

843
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:44,040
I saw the maze part.

844
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,440
I saw the maze.

845
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,240
And there's like spike traps too.

846
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:48,820
Apparently.

847
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:51,620
There's like spike traps at the maze area.

848
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:52,780
And stuff like that.

849
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:54,640
And I was like...

850
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:55,000
Yeah.

851
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,540
I was just like...

852
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:01,840
No.

853
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,180
There's two mazes.

854
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:04,800
What?

855
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:05,100
Okay.

856
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,640
Okay, I thought there was one maze.

857
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:08,800
It's parkour.

858
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:10,520
Paintings maze.

859
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:14,220
And basically...

860
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:15,920
If you get caught by a ghost.

861
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,580
If you get caught by the ghost.

862
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:19,920
In that painting maze.

863
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:22,480
You got reset to the beginning of the maze.

864
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,240
So...

865
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,440
And then...

866
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,740
And then the third one.

867
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,660
Was a spike maze.

868
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:32,660
If you die by the spikes.

869
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,760
You get reset to the beginning of the maze.

870
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:37,240
And then...

871
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:41,320
Then if you went through all that mental torture.

872
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:44,360
You get to do the escape room.

873
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:52,880
So that's why...

874
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:54,340
I was like...

875
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:56,320
Oh my god, just take me here.

876
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,580
That was so cool.

877
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:03,100
Oh my god.

878
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:07,240
I was getting tortured by the dolls.

879
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,360
You know, I took some minecraft pros.

880
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:10,440
Down with me.

881
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:12,740
Rest in peace, 5UP.

882
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:14,020
It was funny though.

883
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:15,160
Not gonna lie.

884
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,160
You would have been in the next game.

885
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:19,860
But it was so funny.

886
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:23,100
That you died next to me.

887
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:25,480
Just for me.

888
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,940
Just for me to die first in the next round.

889
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:32,260
Oh my god.

890
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:34,120
Also.

891
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:36,180
Guys, I found out.

892
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,220
I found out.

893
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:40,260
That on Friday.

894
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:42,040
Is the summer games fest.

895
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:44,560
So I'm gonna be doing a watch along.

896
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:45,260
It might be.

897
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,500
I might just have one rest day.

898
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,200
I'm gonna do a summer game.

899
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,780
A summer game fest watch along on twitch.

900
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:54,180
At like 2pm.

901
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,820
It starts at 2pm, right?

902
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:56,840
Or it starts at 3pm.

903
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,200
Whatever time it starts.

904
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,040
We're gonna do a watch along.

905
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,640
On the 7th.

906
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:05,240
I'll see you guys back on twitch on the 7th.

907
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:05,740
I guess.

908
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:15,620
That was so funny.

909
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:18,320
The one time I got confident.

910
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:20,140
I actually got karma so hard.

911
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,060
Every time I had zero confidence.

912
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:23,160
And I didn't troll.

913
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,800
Like we were okay.

914
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:26,560
And then the moment where I was like.

915
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,340
Spawning the doll right next to us.

916
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,080
It will be so funny.

917
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:32,620
And then they spawned the doll right next to me.

918
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,380
Oh my god.

919
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,860
It's actually messed up.

920
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:46,320
Gumi wants me to watch.

921
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:47,360
Watch Gumi's POV.

922
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:48,520
I'm watching your POV.

923
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:49,000
Why?

924
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:51,200
Why?

925
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:54,700
It was funny though.

926
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:56,420
It was pretty funny.

927
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:05,160
What do you mean she called me for not watching the corner?

928
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:09,160
What do you mean?

929
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,940
I should not be watching that corner.

930
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:15,340
There was a huge pack next to us.

931
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:18,680
There was literally a horde.

932
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:22,840
Why was it me that had to watch it?

933
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:29,440
There were actual Minecraft players.

934
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,480
They should not depend on me to watch a corner.

935
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,280
That's so stupid.

936
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:38,800
Why would you depend on somebody that didn't even know what was going on?

937
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:46,280
That was trying to sabotage.

938
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:50,300
Alright.

939
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:53,660
Let's see.

940
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,040
Let me pull up my stream labels.

941
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:57,000
I want to thank everybody.

942
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,740
Thank you for the tier 1 sub.

943
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,800
Thank you for the tier 1...

944
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,720
Random VTuber 13.

945
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:08,100
Thank you for getting a sub to 5.

946
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:10,860
Okay.

947
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,800
That was good.

948
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,220
Merlin and Crazy.

949
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,000
Thank you for the tier 1 sub.

950
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:19,120
I'm trying to look at the gifteds right now.

951
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,800
Where are the gifteds?

952
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:27,420
Oh my god.

953
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:29,220
Where are the gifteds?

954
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:31,520
Guys, I'm sorry.

955
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:33,420
My thing doesn't sync.

956
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,160
Where are the gifted settings?

957
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:37,100
Donation.

958
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:37,760
Oh no.

959
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:41,000
Guys, I don't remember how to use my labels.

960
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:42,640
Oh, here it is.

961
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:44,840
No, that's not what it is.

962
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:45,900
I just refreshed it.

963
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:47,740
Sorry, I'm trying to remember where the gifts are.

964
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:49,660
Wait, are there no gifts here?

965
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:55,280
Professional streamers.

966
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,580
Anyway, thank you for all the gifts, guys.

967
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:59,040
Dragon, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

968
00:57:59,160 --> 00:57:59,400
Thank you.

969
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:02,500
Well, I get to start my rest now.

970
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,940
What a day, though.

971
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:06,400
Huge shout-out for Twitch.

972
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,600
Thank you for gifting a sub to KekW.

973
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:14,240
I'm just gonna say a huge shout-out for the invite.

974
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,320
I know I was crying about it.

975
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,120
That I made it this far.

976
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,240
But honestly, we had...

977
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:22,440
What a ride, though.

978
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:26,120
What an insane ride we had together.

979
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:28,500
That was actually crazy.

980
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:32,500
I don't think any of us expected the game...

981
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:35,980
expected it to be like this.

982
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:38,560
Day 3 was actually crazy.

983
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:40,420
Oh my god.

984
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:42,620
But yeah, huge shout-out.

985
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:51,340
Huge shout-out to the invite and for going through this whole whole crazy event.

986
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:53,300
I lasted all the way to day 4.

987
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:55,160
I'm proud of myself.

988
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,980
I beat so many pro Minecraft players.

989
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:00,280
We made it so far.

990
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:03,900
So yeah, it was fun.

991
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,260
Thank you everybody for watching.

992
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,400
It's finally over.

993
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,240
We have freedom now.

994
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:10,900
It's finally...

995
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:19,000
It's finally over.

996
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:20,220
We're all free.

997
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:24,120
We can now enjoy resting.

998
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:29,140
I'm going to go raid Gumi so you can check out the rest of the...

999
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:32,680
the rest of the journey if she's still alive.

1000
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:34,980
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

1001
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:37,120
Pause, check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

1002
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:40,220
And if you stay up for me, head to bed because you deserve it.

1003
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:41,400
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

1004
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:42,380
Bye, guys.

1005
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:43,200
Bye.

1006
01:00:16,390 --> 01:00:17,050
Bonus ending.

1007
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:18,930
I forgot to chill as always.

1008
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:22,090
If you guys don't know, I stream on YouTube, so check me out there.

1009
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:32,250
Anyone know whenever I stream on Twitch, check, do exclamation point Twitter and follow me on Twitter.

1010
01:00:32,470 --> 01:00:36,990
Also, YouTube's reveal, YouTube's figure reveal.

1011
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:38,690
I'm going to tweet about it later.

1012
01:00:39,350 --> 01:00:40,850
The YouTube's figure.

1013
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:43,350
Yeah, what else?

1014
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:46,370
If you want to support me via other means, check out my merch.

1015
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:47,230
Thank you guys.

1016
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:48,110
Forgot to chill.

1017
01:00:48,410 --> 01:00:49,370
Anyway, bye for real.
