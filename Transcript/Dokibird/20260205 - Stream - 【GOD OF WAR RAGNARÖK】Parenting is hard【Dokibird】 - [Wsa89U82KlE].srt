1
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:43,060
Hello, hello, oh my god.

2
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,320
Did you guys see the new Overwatch news?

3
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,760
I, I, yes, Overwatch.

4
00:03:51,100 --> 00:04:02,260
By the way, big update in the Overwatch community, in the
FPS community, but they finally decided to call Overwatch 2

5
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,280
Overwatch.

6
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,020
They dropped the deal.

7
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,920
We're like, we're gonna move forward into this new
generation.

8
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,900
of Overwatch.

9
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,240
And then they like went backwards.

10
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,460
They just dropped the two.

11
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,580
Because now it's just no longer called Overwatch 2.

12
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,740
It's now back to Overwatch.

13
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,340
Yeah.

14
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,240
Yeah.

15
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,500
That's like crazy.

16
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:23,540
Yeah.

17
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,360
We're like, we're gonna move forward.

18
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,400
And then they went backwards.

19
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,020
Like so, so much progress.

20
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:34,780
Okay.

21
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,920
The craziest thing is that they literally shadow dropped
five new characters.

22
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:39,500
characters.

23
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,880
I was like, what do we need?

24
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,900
And one of the characters is a fucking cat.

25
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,240
You can play as a cat.

26
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,120
His name is, what is his name again?

27
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,140
I gotta look it up.

28
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,600
Is it just Jetpack cat?

29
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,640
That's literally his name.

30
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,300
Oh my god.

31
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:03,960
His name is literally Jetpack cat and like it's a cat on a
Jetpack and he's a support character.

32
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,860
He's like, he can play as his fucking name.

33
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:16,760
It's Davis jetpack cat and he's a cat on a jetpack and like
I don't know what the fuck he's in I guess he's just gonna

34
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,220
be he's on a little drone.

35
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,200
He's literally on a little drone.

36
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,380
He's the he's the marble rivals Jeff.

37
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,720
I can feel it already.

38
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:32,180
Um Yeah, and then what you could steal your own teammates

48
00:06:53,020 --> 00:07:00,360
they were like they had to you know they're they're like
slowly shifting into like gooner bait characters because

49
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:09,240
because they saw how much money marvel rivals was making on
skins alone and yeah see competition is a good thing see

50
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:19,840
this is uh more sf yay the sfm community it starts rejoicing
um starts celebrating right now and i felt like like seeing

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,240
that all the new characters are introducing i felt like
other than not the cat though the cat i mean also the cat i

52
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:33,560
guess we're like the the jeff bait the jeff slash rocky
raccoon bait um um and it's like it felt like especially

53
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:41,540
domina domina i can feel that she's gonna get a lot of
gooner bait skins because of like i mean look at her like

54
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:49,840
when they're gonna when they're gonna make the next um

55
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:59,940
that list that's getting a swimsuit skin i'm like literally
look at her finally finally kyriko's greed will be

gotta, wait, where is it?

57
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:20,980

face and I'm like, oh my god, it's a cat on a jetpack, and

58
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:29,480
his name is just jetpack cat, like, there's, like, there's
no funny name, he's literally just jetpack cat, because he's

59
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:35,180
a cat on a jetpack, like, we don't even get, like, I mean,
that, I guess that is the funny name, but, like, he doesn't

60
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:53,240
even have, his own name he's just cat on a jetpack um um and
yeah so definitely gonna check out overwatch next week

61
00:08:53,240 --> 00:09:00,760
because i i mean that's so many new characters what um they
they're introducing oh my god domina is a cat tank too oh my

66
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:45,380

talk about oh yes other than that apparently there was like

67
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:51,760
a whole like overwatch huge overwatch update called like
over i don't know overwatch spotlight overwatch spotlight

68
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:58,280
and another thing they announced which i was i couldn't
believe it i was like what the fuck when i saw it was that

69
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:09,240
uh they announced the san rio overwatch collab so um over
there's gonna be said I I am very surprised because the

70
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:16,940
whole you know this game is about beating up people so like
I was very surprised that Sanrio agreed to the collab

71
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:27,000
because like you're killing people so you're you're fucking
killing people so like it doesn't seem very Sanrio like so I

72
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:35,860
was very surprised that they actually um they actually
agreed like it just doesn't seem like a collab that they

73
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:42,740
would they would agree on because you don't really get i
don't know i've never seen san rio do collabs with like

74
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:57,600
games like this it's such a wild combination um but like i i
just i'm like oh my god i get to kill halloweenie like Like,

75
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,800
just like that.

76
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,980
Like, I'm like, I get to, I get to kill Hello Kitty.

77
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:15,920
Like, um, um, anyway, all these new characters just for them
to only give mercy and Kierkegaard skins.

78
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,060
Golden, thank yous for the super chat.

79
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:18,360
Thank you.

80
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,260
They're like, goodbye, Hello Kitty.

81
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,340
Pop, pop.

82
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,640
Like, ask Cassidy.

83
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,680
Like, um, um.

84
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:35,300
I'm not surprised with the I'm not surprised who gets what I
saw people were like be like why it didn't may gets in the

85
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:45,460
morrow but I'm just like bro it's Kiriko it's Kiriko I what
do you think it's Kiriko like she she's gonna get the top

86
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:53,200
die um like rank one and two of course it's gonna go to
mercy and Kiriko they're the rank one and two for skin over

87
00:11:53,200 --> 00:12:01,840
watch skins um I'm like you privilege we should all be
thankful that Lucio can even get anything because he

88
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:11,200
basically he was the token frog so like if he didn't get
because he's so lucky that Kurope is such a popular San Rio

89
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:25,720
character that Lucio can even get anything apparently there
was a there was a um there was a um overwatch you know like

90
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:32,540
the votes for for those who don't know in overwatch they do
a vote system for who gets what skin um and like what skin

91
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:39,860
gets released next and overwatch had like one of the
categories was like street art or like street skate slash

92
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:49,100
skating and then lucio wasn't included you know who was
included mercy and kiriko um and people were like why the

93
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:57,820
fuck that lucio not even get like a street slash skating
themed outfit when he literally is like in this like part of

94
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:09,440
the streets and also is on rollerblades already like there's
no way like how like wait let me see let me see if i can

95
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:18,440
pull it off like pull up this uh the outfit um it's
literally his thing and he's not even included in the skins

96
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:25,400
overwatch new skin vote i saw people were complaining about
so that's why i was just like bro where you should be

97
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:34,260
thankful that lucio is even included in this collaboration
because thank god kurope is a very popular character in san

98
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:47,880
rio so at least he gets one at least he gets at least we are
so lucky thank god thank god there's only one frog character

99
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,900
Yeah, skin must not sell.

100
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,000
It's not that it doesn't sell.

101
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:01,900
It's just that Kiriko and Mercy sells the most.

102
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:10,160
And also, it's because there's a lot of Kiriko one tricks
and a lot of Mercy one tricks and a lot of Widow one tricks.

103
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,700
So all three of them sells the most skins because of it.

104
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:17,580
Because they also have the most disposable income.

105
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,500
They just sell way too well.

106
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:26,780
So there's no point in, like, having, uh, there's no point
in, like, having skins on characters that don't sell well.

107
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,900
Oh, yeah, is it this one?

108
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:28,860
All right, here we go.

109
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:31,960
Oh, my God.

110
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,720
Um, let me see if I can find it.

111
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,760
Oh, wait, it wasn't, it wasn't Mercy and Kierkegaard, it was
Mercy.

112
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,060
Oh, and also Junkrat, too.

113
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:46,400
It's actually surprising how many skins, because there's so
many Junkrat One Trick as well that have disposed.

114
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,560
Of course, of course, the Junkrat One Trick players are the
ones that have disposed.

115
00:14:49,580 --> 00:15:01,500
about income they don't care about anything they don't care
about the theme they just want to play explodey boy um it's

116
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:11,900
it's he's just what they just care about explodey boy anyway
so so this was the one and they were like why isn't lucy all

117
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:24,380
included in here so um so that's why people were like, why
the fuck isn't Lucio included in this batch of skins?

118
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,540
Because they're like, it's literally like Lucio Core.

119
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,780
Yeah, and then they're like, why?

120
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,060
Why is Juggrat in there?

121
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,940
Because they have more money than Lucio players.

122
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:42,840
That's why there's more Juggrat 1 tricks than there are
Lucio 1 tricks in this world.

123
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,260
Life's just unfair.

124
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:50,540
Like, too much Lucio Core to include.

125
00:15:50,560 --> 00:16:01,680
lucio they'll just have an overdose of lucio anyway so
that's oh yeah let me show you guys the other skin uh the

126
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:10,320
standard that i was so surprising i swear it was like every
time i thought i could get away they he always knows how to

127
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:18,800
pull me back in but this time it'll be different i was told
he's changed guys guys he's changed he he dropped the two

128
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:30,800

different now like to keep no the toxic abusive relationship

129
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:38,760
no he's different now he dropped the two he's like he's back
to what he made me fall in love with him in the first place

130
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:49,780
guys he's just overwatch now just like the good old days
guys just like the honeymoon period he's he's overwatch

131
00:16:49,780 --> 00:17:02,980

You don't see him like how I used to see him

132
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:14,580
He's back to his roots guys You don't understand

133
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:31,880
I swear I swear it'll be different I swear like yes he has
hurt me many times and yes I always come crawling back but

134
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:41,440
this time it's different guys this time he has he has a
Sanrio collab guys look look at the shiny new thing guys

135
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:55,980
Sanrio there's a cat on a jetpack guys look he got a new cat
and he's so he's changed he said he has changed and he's

136
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:00,680
right he got a new cat and it's on a jetpack

137
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:18,580
toky don't go back to him toky i've heard those lines before
all right anyway guys under the net that's really all i

138
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:24,580
wanted to talk about because apparently it was like a
fucking huge it is a pretty big thing like they literally

139
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:34,720
shadow drawn five new characters and also a sanrio collab so
like um i am so i am excited to check out what actually has

140
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:45,740
changed oh yeah apparently the ui is different now too um
the the ui is different now so i i personally don't like the

141
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:53,640
new ui because it reminds me of like a gotcha game it's
fucking weird it on it looks like a gotcha game ui and i'm i

142
00:18:53,640 --> 00:19:01,260
don't know if i with that i like the original ui i don't see
why they have to change it i'll show you guys and i

143
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:11,020
personally like the original ui so i think it's weird that
they they change the entire thing like but it to me it just

144
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:22,260
looks like a a gotcha game or like uh i mean it is free to
play um oh my god remember when but oh it's like gotcha

Thank you, thank you, crazy.

182
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,790
You think he's thinking about me right now?

183
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,850
You know, like, oh, we've been together for so long.

184
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:03,750
It's like on and off, you know, but we always get back
together in the end, guys.

185
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:09,530
Like, you know, we always do somehow always get back
together in the end.

186
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:17,690
And, you think, and he's like, you know, he's different now,
you know, he has, he has a cat, guys, he has a cat on a jet

187
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:17,970
pack.

188
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:24,850
And, you know, he's back to his old whimsy self, you know,
when we used to say being like, oh, man, why don't you have

189
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:29,890
fun characters like Winchton, you know, a giant gorilla, you
know, giant talking gorilla.

190
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:33,050
And then they kept making like more humans and stuff.

191
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:35,270
And we're like, there's no more whimsy anymore.

192
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:40,590
There's more excitement in your, in your character creations
and stuff like that.

193
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:47,990
And then he introduced Brig, like Brigette, Brig G, oh my
God, I forgot her, Brig, you know, and then it all went

194
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:51,030
downhill when she, he introduced Brig.

195
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:59,010
And then I, we were like, there's no more whimsy anymore,
you know, and, and then, and now look, he's back to his old

196
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:02,610
self again, what made us fell in love in the first place,
guys.

197
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:12,750
pack and also i mean he did introduce like the most fucking
gooner bait uh character in over and watch that i've ever

198
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:20,370

Orissa Shields.

210
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:20,820
You know what that's part?

211
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:28,660
And then they shoot the shield up into the sky so they can
reset the fucking shield in the corner instantly.

212
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,560
He's lucky to have you.

213
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:34,620
Just bring back double shield meta at this point.

214
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,440
Just bring back goats.

215
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:43,880

cancer cops tell me about the camp dog oh my god look at him

breeding farm north of here we all told him she was beyond

00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:40,160
alright alright seems okay okay so it's just OBS tinkering
up and down the river delta.

221
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:46,080
Once Odin's army came to town, I led out of there faster
than a tassel worm with its bottom ablaze.

222
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,020
So frazzled, I accidentally left behind a few
irreplaceables.

224
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,280

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,440
Ooh, what do I get?

231
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,640
I didn't come across any of my old beautifully rusted armor
pieces.

244
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:16,650
What else do I want to...

245
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:17,990
Ooh, wait.

246
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:23,610
Luck chance grants a blessing of cooldown when interrupting
double blue ring attacks.

247
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:25,170
Or parrying.

248
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:25,850
Oh, okay.

249
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,770
I've been parrying a lot, so that should be good.

250
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:29,170
I don't know.

251
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:30,910
It is level four.

252
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:35,130
Okay, double tap the shield bash for stun.

253
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:39,750
It's a shield fit for staying mobile and charging up.

254
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:41,850
I guess we're like double taps, right?

255
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:50,510
it charge up blocking attack deplete some charge shield
punch right before an attack hits you to absorb it and gain

256
00:30:50,510 --> 00:31:02,510
a burst of damage all right we'll try that up because it
does say 55 defense and i like it when numbers go up when

00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,690
Wait, what's this?

263
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:41,950
What?

264
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:44,110

All right.

275
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,980
Number go big means...

276
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:05,130
Oh, is it this?

277
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,290
Undiscovered.

278
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:07,950
Wait, why is it undiscovered?

279
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:08,750
undiscovered.

280
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:10,970
Is that where the orb is?

281
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,650
Is this where the orb is, guys?

282
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:17,730
Is that why it's undiscovered?

283
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:21,030
More damage means more power.

284
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:23,890
Number go up.

285
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:24,870

say is he's never seen a light health and dark health work
together.

295
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:10,730

Should you ever find your way to the forbidden sands and
Alphine?

298
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:20,790
Contested territory.

299
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:21,810
Pass the barons.

300
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:26,210
There are rumors of a sanctum and artifacts our elders don't
want us to see.

301
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:30,590
Anything that sheds light on our suppressed history would
benefit all of Alphine.

302
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:32,490
Uncovering secret history?

303
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,730
Sounds like my kind of adventure.

304
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:45,930
together stories of alfheim before the division of light and
dark it's very taboo didn't stop you from spreading word of

305
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:54,410
it oh how you ended up in prison where she and I met as
enemies naturally but escaped as friends and now more than

306
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:56,450
friends oh

307
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:18,170
I miss the light do you the truth I still feel its pull you
want nothing else when you're near it it's so forbidden

308
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:27,850
you're only biting time until you can drink again from the
light but then again the light does not make good food it

309
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:34,070
doesn't play music or tell jokes or open your eyes to new
things it makes you run in place.

310
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:39,310
The more I am away from it, the more I see it for what it
really is.

311
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:40,150
What is it?

312
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:41,730
And I don't need it anymore.

313
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:43,590
Oh my god, he's doing it.

314
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:46,650
He's sober.

315
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:48,090
He's sober now.

316
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:50,210
He doesn't need the light drug.

317
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:54,490
Is someone going to ask me if I miss Oh, I'm sorry, man.

318
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:55,130
Of course.

319
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,370
How rude of me.

320
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:57,510
In their defense, love.

321
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:00,870
You are usually not the most talkative.

322
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:06,070
He's like, now that I have a hot A hot, dark elf girlfriend?

323
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:07,390
I don't need no light.

324
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:10,490
The elders say it is why we fight.

325
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:14,130
But all of that...

326
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:14,810
It's shit.

327
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:17,490
I am more than the high.

328
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:19,290
More than a soldier.

329
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,770
Light elves, dark elves.

330
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:24,330
Damn, she's a strong independent woman.

331
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:28,310
Stubborn, brainless as moths blinded by their light.

332
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,930
So true, sister.

333
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:43,050
the shadows and there I found my people yeah I would stop
smoking for my for my girlfriend too for my hot goth

understand your Oh my god, wait, he's still talking.

336
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:08,790
When things quiet down, I'd love to hear their ideas and
your own.

337
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:11,670
I have nothing to say that will interest you.

338
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:12,770
Nonsense, brother.

339
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:16,130
I've heard many a wise word past those sunburned lips.

340
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:18,090
It's all right, Mavir.

341
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:20,450
My wife is much the same way.

342
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:20,990
Careful.

343
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,210

344
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:27,090

Actually, I'll get the original armor is really cute, but
But then I get to see her neck in the song.

375
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:06,620
I get to see her beautiful neck.

376
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,880
Alright, let's sort.

377
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,320
Okay, Toki.

I get to see her lovely personality more in this outfit,

379
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,180
Wait, is that a dress?

380
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,640
Okay, what is the other armor?

381
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,320
Okay, wait.

382
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,840
I want to see what does it look like with this.

383
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:46,640
Oh, but then, like, the dress covers the back more.

384
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:52,780
Wait, sorry, we're getting a little fashion show with my new
wife.

385
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:57,120
I can't see her legs, though.

386
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,400
Her personality.

387
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,760
Sorry, I can't see her personality more.

388
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,760
Give me a sec.

389
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:10,600
Sorry, Freya.

390
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,440
Just give me a sec.

391
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:16,000
I just gotta know which armor shows your personality more to
me.

392
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,700
Yeah, I think I like her original.

393
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,700
Her original is better.

394
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,460
Her original makes her personality shine a lot.

395
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,300
You'll need an enchantment on your chisel to use it.

396
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,500
How do I do that?

397
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:41,790
Oh, oh my god.

398
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:43,610
That's easy.

399
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:50,690
The letter I.

400
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:52,390
That's it.

401
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,310
It's just...

402
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:54,510
It's an incantation.

403
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:55,570
I'll speak it.

404
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:03,130
Look at that!

405
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:04,810
We're doing it!

406
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:08,790

Yeah, I got used to it Okay, how do I locked by more vines?

408
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:16,110
Remember what to do?

409
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:22,190
Actually, I don't It's been two weeks, ladies It's been...

410
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:24,630
Oh my god, it was like...

00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:25,890
Oh, yeah, it was that!

412
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:27,890
Okay, and then...

413
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:30,990
It's actually been two weeks.

414
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:32,350
I've actually...

415
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:34,110
Um...

416
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:38,450
What the fuck do I do?

417
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:40,830
It's been so long.

418
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:44,190
Oh.

419
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:48,870
Oh, wait, here.

420
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:56,390
Um.

421
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:57,310
Give me a sec.

422
00:43:57,950 --> 00:43:59,290
I wonder where the control is again.

423
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:00,350
Give me a sec.

424
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:03,810
Oh, it's here.

425
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:04,270
It's here.

426
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:04,650
It's here.

427
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:05,410
Okay, okay, okay.

428
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:06,210
Oh, yeah.

429
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:07,550
I figured it out.

430
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:10,810
Wait.

431
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:12,310
Oh, right, one.

432
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:12,930
Oh, here we go.

433
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:13,930
All right.

434
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:18,930
And then, boom!

435
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:21,090
What?

436
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:23,150
Oh, shit.

437
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:23,730
I fucked it up.

438
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:26,370
Okay, one, two, three.

439
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:28,710
Boom!

440
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:30,490
There we go.

441
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:31,050
See, exactly.

442
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:31,710
See, I told you guys.

443
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:33,650
It's like riding a bicycle.

444
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:35,410
It has something on it I don't recognize.

445
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:37,810
All right.

446
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:39,890
And then we...

447
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:41,330
There you go.

448
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:42,650
We did it.

449
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:44,970
See, guys, it's like riding a bicycle.

450
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:50,330
Okay, look, it's called Ping, okay?

451
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:53,710
There's 500 MMS right now to my brain.

452
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:54,990
It's 1230 p.m.

453
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:56,030
Ship shape.

454
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:57,930
He sleeps in a broom closet now.

455
00:44:58,330 --> 00:44:59,170
But he's adjusting.

456
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:00,690
How did you find him?

457
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:06,410
Largely, that's down to Atreus, having figured out how to
access the prophecies giants reserved for their own kind.

458
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:09,990
We only learned of it ourselves after Thor and Odin came
calling.

459
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:11,110
To your home?

460
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:13,490
Is it still standing?

461
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:14,530
Barely.

462
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:20,010
But all the violence was seemingly just a distraction to let
Odin have a private one with Atreus.

463
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:21,750
Odin was alone with your son?

464
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:24,130
Did he tell you what they spoke of?

465
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:24,890
Yes.

466
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:28,010
He said that Odin invited him to Asgard.

467
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:29,270
Oh my gosh.

468
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:31,890
It's like a little family meeting.

469
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:33,570
He's rushing into Faden's searcher.

470
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:35,490
That's troubling.

471
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:39,170
He gets to meet the family.

472
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:41,770
I guess to go to Asgard.

473
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:43,870
God, what's so troubling about that?

474
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:46,430
If you're ready to talk to him, the Mystic Gateway is ahead.

475
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:52,090
If not, I have some unfinished business up this river I
could use your help with.

476
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:53,470
Wait, what's ahead?

477
00:45:57,770 --> 00:45:59,790
I'm right, there's so many choices.

478
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:02,650
If you want to continue exploring, we'll need to remove that
log in the river.

479
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:04,190
Alright, we got this.

480
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:04,870
Ooh, loot!

481
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:05,950
Wait, what's this?

482
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:07,370
What is this?

483
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:11,630
The crest of Skirnear, never quite as smart as he thought.

484
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:13,770
Oh, nice.

485
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:14,150
Loot.

486
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:15,450
I love loot.

487
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:19,670
More loot!

488
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:22,150
Alright, so...

489
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:23,910
Wait, was this something special?

490
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:26,790
No, it's just a random pot.

491
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:30,190
Alright, let's destroy this real quick.

492
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:35,270
Alright, we got five in the orb.

493
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:38,130
Oh, yay!

494
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:38,770
More loot!

495
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:40,130
I love loot!

496
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:42,970
Yeah, quick side question.

497
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:44,450
10 minutes in and out.

498
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:45,890
Surely it'll be okay, right?

499
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:49,950
Not necessarily, but good.

500
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:52,310
I mean, she's going to be stronger.

501
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:53,550
That's always a plus.

502
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:56,510
I left something behind near the falls.

503
00:46:57,170 --> 00:46:57,970
Your wedding sign.

504
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,410
Now, why do you want to be going back there?

505
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:02,750
To be free of the bonds of my marriage.

506
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:03,970
What the fuck is that?

507
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:07,050
I think you severed that a long time ago.

508
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:08,110
Not completely.

509
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:09,990
Oh, it's a big John Pig.

510
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:10,870
Guide us.

511
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,590
What else would she...

512
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:15,110
How else would she be connected?

513
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:17,370
Favors.

514
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:18,150
I assume...

515
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:23,070
Am I going to reach the entrance of Faria's wedding?

516
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:23,690
Alright, where...

517
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:24,690
How far is it?

518
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:28,130
How far is it compared to the orb?

519
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:30,170
Okay.

520
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:31,650
That one...

521
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:32,230
Okay, alright.

522
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:32,770
So it's just...

523
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:33,610
It's on the path.

524
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:34,630
Where am I, actually?

525
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:35,310
Wait a minute.

526
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:36,890
What's this?

527
00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:37,930
Faria's cap?

528
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:39,670
Okay, I'm right here.

529
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:40,070
Alright.

530
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:44,330
Oh, that's cute.

531
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:46,430
The wildlife here is really cute.

532
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:47,070
Oh my god.

533
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:48,190
Look, it's a monkey!

534
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:51,070
Shoot it.

535
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:58,440
All right.

536
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,940
Oh my god, there's... Oh, okay.

537
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:01,700
There's my people.

538
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:02,640
There's a crow here.

539
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:03,840
Many ages ago.

540
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:08,200
Thousands traveled it on pilgrimage to the shrine of
worship.

541
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,800
But then the Asir came.

542
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:16,620
I'll go.

543
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,100
I'm already lost.

544
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,960
The wilds reclaimed it.

545
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,580
It was beautiful ones.

546
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:26,540
Alright.

547
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,880
That seems like a friendly animal.

548
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:30,300
Hello, are you okay?

549
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:31,700
Hello?

550
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:32,780
Oh, not friendly!

551
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:33,700
Not friendly!

552
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:35,600
Oh my god, it's not a pig!

553
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:38,420
Oh, fuck!

554
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:39,760
Okay, I don't remember how to play this game.

555
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:40,840
It's not...

556
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:43,940
Guys, it wasn't a fucking...

557
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:46,360
I thought it was a friendly giant pig.

558
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:49,340
Okay.

559
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,000
Oh, my God.

560
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:52,780
Oh, my God.

561
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:54,060
I don't remember how to play.

562
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:56,460
I actually don't remember how to play this game.

563
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:58,120
Oh, this is so bad.

564
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:59,540
This is so bad.

565
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:03,400
Okay.

566
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:04,380
Okay, I got this.

567
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,440
Okay, I don't know how to throw.

568
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:07,460
Oh, shit.

569
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:08,580
Get buried.

570
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:10,500
That's fucking right.

571
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:11,800
Where's my?

572
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:12,580
Where's my axe?

573
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:13,320
Where is it?

574
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:14,400
Oh, my God.

575
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,160
Just.

576
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:18,700
Press all the buttons!

577
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,120
Surely something is right!

578
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:24,940
Alright, he's down.

579
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:26,620
Oh my god!

580
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:29,480
Oh shit, okay!

581
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:32,400
Alright, do your thing!

582
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:33,000
Do your thing!

583
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,740
Okay, he's no longer evil.

584
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:44,960
I mean, he's still evil, but he's no longer evil, evil.

585
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:45,760
Oh, okay.

586
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:47,420
Everything's fine.

587
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,560
Oh shit!

588
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:56,100
Okay.

589
00:49:58,700 --> 00:49:59,920
Okay, it's fine.

590
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:00,500
It's okay.

591
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,780
Things are fine right now.

592
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:05,260
Oh, okay.

593
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:05,700
It's okay.

594
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:08,800
Wait, wait.

595
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:10,820
I'll use...

596
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:12,840
Yeah, that's fucking right.

597
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:15,260
Okay.

598
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,260
Oh my god, he just fucking flicks it away.

599
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:22,360
That's cheating.

600
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:24,880
No!

601
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:25,640
Oh shit!

602
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,620
I'm trying to remember how to switch weapons!

603
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:28,800
Oh!

604
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:31,300
No!

605
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:33,620
Okay, okay, it's okay.

606
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:34,640
We did it.

607
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,480
It's so...

608
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:41,680
This game is so easy, guys.

609
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:42,480
I...

610
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,600
So easy.

611
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,920
Not even close.

612
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,740
Okay, um, let me try to remember how to swap weapons.

613
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,220
Okay, this is sheaving the weapon.

614
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:58,220
Okay, left, right.

615
00:50:58,300 --> 00:50:59,720
Okay, this is how I swap weapons.

616
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:01,100
All right, I figured it out.

617
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:04,040
Only took one fight.

618
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:06,820
Another quest?

619
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:10,760
Why does everyone want me to do their errands?

620
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:12,320
Spirit.

621
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:14,980
You return.

622
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:16,120
Astrid.

least.

630
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:24,120
Yay!

631
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,420
Why do I purge this?

632
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:31,280
You suspicious of her, brother?

633
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:35,700
If the orb she seeks is important, she would not have left
it behind.

634
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,040
Where is the poisonous dance?

635
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:38,860
Yeah?

636
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,460
They're poisoning Astrid's garden.

637
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,380
Oh, here!

638
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:46,020
Oh!

639
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,360
Well, I need to figure out how to shoot that.

640
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:52,880
Oh, here you go.

641
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:53,660
Shoot it here.

642
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,160
No, right here.

643
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:55,480
Oh, wait.

644
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:56,840
And then...

645
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:57,080
Boop!

646
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:57,480
Oh!

647
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:00,200
Oh, okay.

648
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:00,940
That's awkward.

649
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:03,520
Um...

650
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:06,100
Uh...

651
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,220
Okay, wait, wait.

652
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:07,940
I get it.

653
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:09,560
And then...

654
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:10,200
Boop!

655
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,240
There we go.

656
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:12,980
That I figured it out.

657
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:17,600
Okay.

658
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:18,620
And then...

659
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,660
Yeah, but where do I sit over here?

660
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:24,600
From a different angle.

661
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:28,020
I mean, yeah, that works.

662
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,180
If it works, it works.

663
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,000
Oh, I gotta read real quick.

664
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:39,880
This mentions a spell that puts trolls to sleep.

665
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,920
And a magic relic that acts as a sort of counter spell.

666
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:46,900
Alright, where is the last fire?

667
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:49,700
I mean...

668
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:50,240
No?

669
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:52,900
How do I get there?

670
00:53:57,740 --> 00:53:59,320
It's like in there.

671
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:01,760
I don't know how to reach that pot.

672
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:05,420
This pot might be harder to reach.

673
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:08,720
Yeah, attacks failed successfully.

674
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,340
Oh, there it is.

675
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:13,440
How?

676
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,900
It's like all the way up here.

677
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,260
How the fuck do I reach that?

678
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:20,200
Purple arrow.

679
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,300
Oh, yeah!

680
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:22,260
I forgot.

681
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:26,600
It's like that.

682
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,620
Sigil arrows won't work on this.

683
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:31,380
Why not?

684
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:35,240
Oh, my God.

685
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:35,920
The way for it.

686
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:36,500
Recharge.

687
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:39,260
Oh, my God.

688
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:39,920
This is... Okay.

689
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,940
I'm trying to figure out where to aim this at.

690
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:44,820
Maybe here?

691
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:45,880
No?

692
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:47,900
Or here?

693
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:50,860
There you go.

694
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:51,660
That should work.

695
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:58,640
Okay, maybe not.

696
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:00,560
Maybe.

697
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:02,380
Oh my god!

698
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,380
And he shoots me too!

699
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,200
Go up and around?

700
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:11,300
Maybe, like, here.

701
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:17,500
Alright, here we go.

702
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:19,600
Are you fucking kidding me?

703
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,640
Are you...

704
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:23,720
Oh!

705
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:24,340
Okay, all right.

706
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:24,640
Don't worry.

707
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:25,780
I figured this out, guys.

708
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:26,860
Don't worry.

709
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,060
It's so easy.

710
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:31,780
There you go.

711
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:34,400
What?

712
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,020
You're totally fucking connected.

713
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:38,100
What do you mean?

714
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:47,040
Oh, my God.

715
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:49,080
Where else would you be connected to?

716
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:54,560
I await the day when my garden closes again.

717
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:55,260
I'm so good.

718
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,340
I'm confused.

719
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:58,380
Behind me?

720
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,260
What's behind me?

721
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,200
Just a dead lady.

722
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:09,580
I have to find the core.

723
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,840
Where the fuck is this core?

724
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:17,640
There's nothing else connected to it.

725
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,080
Of the opposite building?

726
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,380
I can get on top of it?

727
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:27,320
That's an option?

728
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:30,240
I'm just like...

729
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:31,480
What do you mean?

730
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:39,160
I'm just as confused as you, Kratos.

731
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:40,040
Don't worry.

732
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:45,660
Okay, I'm gonna...

733
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,300
Do this real quick and look around.

734
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,880
Maybe he's like around here.

735
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:53,020
Like hidden in the...

736
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:53,960
In the poison.

737
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:55,580
You know?

738
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:59,740
Can I not do it from here?

739
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,300
Or do I just have to leave this area?

740
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:17,120
finally oh my god you're actually legally not allowed to
kill the monkey like it's like some endangered species shit

741
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:29,140
he's like on the list i'm legally not allowed to shoot the
monkey he's a protected he's a protected species all right

742
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:30,020

743
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:42,950
this building what building am i looking at this one not

744
00:57:47,780 --> 00:58:05,140

745
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:16,820

you're doing is moping moping doesn't help anybody I'm

746
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:18,440
trying my best, lady.

747
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:22,720
What are you doing?

748
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:24,040
You're just dead.

749
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:27,860
Like, what is your purpose?

750
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,800
I want to grab that, but I don't know how.

751
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,800
Oh, wow, Doki.

752
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,300
You're just gonna victim blame now.

753
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:49,020
Look, I am trying my best to help her out, but if she's just
gonna sit all day moping about it, it ain't gonna solve

754
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:49,900
anything.

755
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:53,280
Freya, something your brother said.

756
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:56,580
The Ace here burned him.

757
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:03,680
We weren't yet at war, but relations with the Vanir and Ace
here had been hostile for ages.

758
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:09,560
Freya got it into his head that he could improve relations
by sharing our magic with them.

759
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:10,540
How the fuck do I do this?

760
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:13,080
Vanir techniques for bountiful harvests.

761
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,460
Enough to feed their whole...

762
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:23,460
population getting set on fire was the thanks he got that's
true the acer were too undisciplined and impatient for the

763
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:34,660
subtlety of vanier spellcraft so when things went wrong they
blamed their teacher ah but enough of that for now all right

764
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:48,920
left wall for closed door what wait okay so like for that
puzzle is it like Is like the answer like in the area or

765
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:49,440
what?

766
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,240
Or do I have to like go somewhere else?

767
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:56,120
Like for this, for the answer to this puzzle.

768
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:01,640
Like is the answer here in the area or is it actually
somewhere else?

769
01:00:07,450 --> 01:00:09,890
Just right of the poison.

770
01:00:10,870 --> 01:00:14,310
Oh my god there was a fucking course of course there were.

771
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:17,890
Of course there's always a hidden passage.

772
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:21,730
A fucking course there was a hidden area.

773
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:27,750
Alright, there it is.

774
01:00:29,310 --> 01:00:30,890
That has to be the route.

775
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:35,910
Yeah.

776
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:39,430
There we go.

777
01:00:41,950 --> 01:00:42,390
Learn anything?

778
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:47,250
Alright, nice.

779
01:00:47,690 --> 01:00:48,610
And then...

780
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:48,970
Ringo!

781
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:50,150
Yay!

782
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:54,330
I did it.

783
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:56,030
I solved the puzzle, guys.

784
01:00:56,670 --> 01:00:58,030
It was in the corner.

785
01:01:02,790 --> 01:01:03,670
Look, it's been two weeks.

786
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:08,010
Guys, it's been two weeks, guys.

787
01:01:08,510 --> 01:01:10,090
It's been so long.

788
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:11,270
Oh my god, it blooms.

789
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:14,250
Does that mean there's a hidden area here, too?

790
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:17,070
Look.

791
01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:19,970
The door's held shut by that counterweight.

792
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:21,450
We lower it.

793
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:22,330
The door will open.

794
01:01:22,450 --> 01:01:23,450
The counterweight?

795
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:24,690
What

796
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:31,080
do you mean by counterweight?

797
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:35,900
Wait.

798
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:38,400
Oh!

799
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:40,740
That counterweight.

800
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:42,100
How do I get that?

801
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:44,120
Okay, wait.

802
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:47,960
Uh...

803
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:50,620
Can I reach that?

804
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:52,180
I don't think so.

805
01:01:55,530 --> 01:01:55,940
Huh?

806
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,760
I don't think I can reach that eye.

807
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,020
I don't know if I can reach that eye.

808
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,180
Maybe we could get closer from the other side.

809
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:06,140
Yeah, but then I'm on a boat and apparently I can't do shit
on the boat.

810
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:08,280
Like...

811
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:11,480
But I'm on the boat, like I'm not allowed to touch anything.

812
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:13,740
They're growing from that bridge.

813
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:21,200
I guess I have to be like over there on that bridge to do
anything.

814
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:27,650
Alright, let's go climb up that wall again.

815
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:34,140
I'm pretty sure I have to throw my axe up there.

816
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:39,740
Guys, it might have been a bad decision to wait two weeks.

817
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:41,760
Just maybe.

818
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:44,360
Okay.

819
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:47,100
There we go.

820
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:48,860
I fixed your stupid garden.

821
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:54,750
Let's return to Astrid.

822
01:02:55,430 --> 01:02:55,790
Alright.

823
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:58,130
Your garden is fixed now.

824
01:02:58,850 --> 01:03:00,190
You can go see the light.

825
01:03:00,950 --> 01:03:02,510
Go across the light.

826
01:03:02,930 --> 01:03:03,330
Yes.

827
01:03:03,970 --> 01:03:04,190
Oh!

828
01:03:07,070 --> 01:03:11,070
It's time to move on.

829
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:16,010
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

830
01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:17,890
Whoa, in front of me?

831
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:18,370
Wow.

832
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:19,870
What did I get out of it?

833
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:21,770
A temporary one.

834
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:23,770
The garden will die again.

835
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:25,370
Yeah, but she won't know.

836
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:27,850
That is no reason not to try.

837
01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:32,610
Yeah, but she won't know that it's gonna die.

838
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:38,150
All right, let's go this way.

839
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:43,390
When I go find the orb, the orb is very important.

840
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:48,090
It's this way.

841
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:50,290
Following the compass?

842
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:52,250
Because I can follow directions.

843
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:52,990
We're close.

844
01:03:53,570 --> 01:03:55,070
There should be a gate up ahead.

845
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:00,700
That's quite a gate.

846
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:02,660
Don't suppose you know a way through.

847
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:04,100
A pilgrim gate.

848
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:06,040
I can open it.

849
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:08,540
We just need to find the right vantage point.

850
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:24,880
is this not good enough like okay uh what is considered the
right vantage what does she mean by that like so flair was a

851
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:33,800
guest when odin burned him not exactly that's not romantic
enough he saw the potential of the magic and wanted to know

852
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:42,100
more than how to improve crop yields It was a mob of lesser
Aesir, bitter and short-sighted, who tied him up and lit him

853
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:42,680
a flame.

854
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,840
Oh, up here!

855
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:46,040
Okay, I see it.

856
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:47,480
I see it.

857
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:48,380
Obviously, he survived.

858
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:51,160
In fact, he used the opportunity to escape.

859
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:54,820
But such an affront made war inevitable.

860
01:04:56,020 --> 01:04:58,200
Freyr certainly wasn't the same after that.

861
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:00,100
At least for a while.

862
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:05,880
His carefree ways were replaced with nightmares, paranoia,
and lies.

863
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:17,720
lashing out it doesn't excuse what he said at my wedding but
i do understand where his anger came from all right let us

864
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:27,720
go read a little bit here before we go back to our quest
multiple upgrades are available what do those fancy words

865
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:36,400
say all right let's see if there's anything oh oh nice i can
upgrade my axe that's actually pretty good for free and

866
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:51,460
whatnot um what am i what am i equipped on oh wait that's
level four oh level four is better than level three oh but

867
01:05:51,460 --> 01:06:04,680
this has 18 on it you know what i'm gonna craft this 18 is
better than uh oh equip please 11 and i can upgrade this too

868
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:13,000
Kratos so offended that Odin burned Freya because he and
Greeks highly vile hospitality.

869
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:17,040
He even let Thor and Odin into his home because they asked
politely and brought a gift.

870
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:18,160
Oh, that makes sense.

871
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:21,940
Look, he is a murderer, but he's a very polite murderer.

872
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:22,880
A banana.

873
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:23,960
Thank you for the super chat.

874
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:24,720
Thank you.

875
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:25,020
Thank you.

876
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:28,920
Look.

877
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:31,340
Manners still exist.

878
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:36,440
You still owe me the story of who made these things.

879
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:41,060
Okay, what do I have equipped right now?

880
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:43,620
Actually, what even did I make?

881
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:48,140
Okay, I had to cast a castive blow at the end of the R1
combo.

882
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,960
Okay, I love the R1 combo.

883
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:54,620
Oh, I have this equipped.

884
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:59,320
Okay, I'll upgrade this right now since I have it.

885
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:00,620
I'll put some hurt on them.

886
01:07:04,110 --> 01:07:05,370
Alright, any better armor?

887
01:07:05,990 --> 01:07:06,510
Oh,

888
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:12,420
Wait, level 5?

889
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:16,600
For this arm, I'm going to get better armor, right?

890
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:17,240
With the orb?

891
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:19,220
Is it better than this, chat?

892
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:26,160
Is the armor better than the lost Kuras or Suras?

893
01:07:32,020 --> 01:07:33,560
I'll make this one too.

894
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:36,340
Oh, it's free?

895
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:41,040
Oh, I don't even have...

896
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:41,980
Never mind.

897
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:43,320
I don't even have the equipment.

898
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:45,160
Never mind.

899
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:46,360
I don't even.

900
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:47,180
Oh, I have the belt.

901
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:48,860
I do have the belt, though.

902
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:51,280
Okay, we'll craft the belt.

903
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:53,000
It's level five.

904
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:56,920
Alright.

905
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:58,440
Grab the belt.

906
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:06,860
Unfortunately, don't have the bracers or whatever the fuck
that was.

907
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:09,780
I mean...

908
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:10,380
Enchantments.

909
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:11,240
Oh my god.

910
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,320
There's so many stuff I can do now.

911
01:08:19,940 --> 01:08:21,820
Oh, my head hurts.

912
01:08:24,820 --> 01:08:29,860
It's like, there's too many things I can do.

913
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:33,220
An enchantment with Misty.

914
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:35,960
Okay, increases melee damage when he's above.

915
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:38,360
Okay, based on luck.

916
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:40,820
I'll craft that.

917
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:42,660
More mass.

918
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,640
All right, how do I equip that then?

919
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:47,480
Wait.

920
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:51,120
Wait, how do I equip that?

921
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:53,700
Where can I put it?

922
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:54,160
Oh, here.

923
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:55,460
There we go.

924
01:08:58,920 --> 01:08:59,760
Okay, I figured it out.

925
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:01,480
Feels like there was something else.

926
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:04,060
Alright.

927
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:05,020
Figured...

928
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:05,700
Oh, shit, wait.

929
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:09,660
Wait, there's a chest here.

930
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:13,060
Oh, I don't know where that opens, though.

931
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:15,480
Alright, we'll go here first.

932
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:18,960
We'll disembark here for the free stuff.

933
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:21,680
And I feel like there might be enemies here.

934
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:23,840
because why are there fire pots in the open?

935
01:09:24,940 --> 01:09:25,780
Oh, there it is.

936
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:28,200
BAB!

937
01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:30,160
What am I right?

938
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:31,420
Where?

939
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:32,820
Oh, here!

940
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:36,520
That's fucking right.

941
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:39,720
Ace!

942
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:41,480
BAB!

943
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:43,160
I'll get rid of the...

944
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:46,900
Oh, wait, she's summoning them.

945
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:47,680
That makes sense.

946
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:49,020
That should make sense.

947
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:50,340
Oh, shit.

948
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:50,900
Oh, fuck.

949
01:09:50,980 --> 01:09:51,160
Okay.

950
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:51,840
It's okay.

951
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:52,160
It's okay.

952
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:56,720
I can I remember I'll play this game Okay, that's not good.

953
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:57,860
That's not good guys.

954
01:09:58,140 --> 01:10:13,380
Okay, I swear to God I remember I'll play this game Oh, it's

01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:28,520
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

957
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:31,160
I swear to God, I won't play this game.

958
01:10:34,270 --> 01:10:35,250
There you go.

959
01:10:38,650 --> 01:10:39,650

960
01:10:40,910 --> 01:10:41,350
Oh, fuck.

961
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:44,370

962
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:46,970
Oh my god, I'm not doing okay right now.

963
01:10:46,970 --> 01:10:48,130

964
01:10:48,430 --> 01:10:52,790

God fucking damn it.

987
01:13:04,910 --> 01:13:07,450
I forgot those guys existed.

988
01:13:11,230 --> 01:13:12,750
All right, um...

989
01:13:13,410 --> 01:13:14,950
Does my thing reach it?

990
01:13:15,670 --> 01:13:16,590
God damn it.

991
01:13:16,650 --> 01:13:18,430
What does my thing reach?

992
01:13:21,910 --> 01:13:22,350
Oh.

993
01:13:25,130 --> 01:13:26,430
Does anyone remember what the kid...

994
01:13:26,430 --> 01:13:27,210
Oh, there it is.

995
01:13:28,630 --> 01:13:29,610
Okay, I marched.

996
01:13:30,010 --> 01:13:30,650
I matched it.

997
01:13:31,710 --> 01:13:34,850
Like, how do I reach that?

998
01:13:36,170 --> 01:13:38,050
My thing doesn't go that far.

999
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:38,870
Oops, whoops.

1000
01:13:40,330 --> 01:13:41,910
It's not that long.

1001
01:13:42,810 --> 01:13:46,610
It's a very above average size, but it's not that long.

1002
01:13:49,130 --> 01:13:49,990
Okay, here.

1003
01:13:50,090 --> 01:13:50,450
Here you go.

1004
01:13:51,070 --> 01:13:52,050
I can touch that.

1005
01:13:53,630 --> 01:13:54,610
All right, this.

1006
01:13:54,710 --> 01:13:55,730
Okay, I can touch that.

1007
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:01,300
All right.

1008
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:01,980
There we go.

1009
01:14:03,980 --> 01:14:05,140
That should work now.

1010
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:07,340
Are you serious?

1011
01:14:10,660 --> 01:14:11,620
Okay, here.

1012
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:16,540
There we go.

1013
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:17,220
I did it.

1014
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:18,000
Look like that worked.

1015
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:19,580
Easy.

1016
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:22,380
Oh, and there's a chest here, too.

1017
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:24,580
So easy.

1018
01:14:28,060 --> 01:14:28,520
Yay!

1019
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:29,520
Free money.

1020
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:31,340
All right, I kicked that.

1021
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:31,920
down.

1022
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:36,540
I need to check what's over here.

1023
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,420
I fucking knew it.

1024
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:47,920
I fucking knew it's not just one trap.

1025
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:51,120
It's not it's never just one trap.

1026
01:14:51,660 --> 01:14:53,840
It's never one.

1027
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:01,780
I grab this.

1028
01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:12,520

1031
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:37,000
Oh, it's time to read.

1032
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:46,240
The runic word appeared over there.

1033
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:47,040
See it?

1034
01:15:47,660 --> 01:15:48,200
Oh, yeah.

1035
01:15:49,740 --> 01:15:50,560
Alright, it's time to write.

1036
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:51,420
Oh my god.

1037
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:54,960
My new wife is teaching me how to read and write.

1038
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:58,160
I actually love right there.

1039
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,220
We should be able to reach the wedding scene.

1040
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:02,680
Nice.

1041
01:16:06,380 --> 01:16:08,660
Just teach me how to read and write, guys.

1042
01:16:13,230 --> 01:16:15,210
Yeah, why did my son not do that?

1043
01:16:15,770 --> 01:16:17,090
Yeah, honestly.

1044
01:16:20,510 --> 01:16:23,090
My dead beast son wouldn't even teach me how to read.

1045
01:16:25,390 --> 01:16:28,730
Despite his actions in Midgard, Atreus does still care for
you.

1046
01:16:29,030 --> 01:16:29,230
I know.

1047
01:16:30,530 --> 01:16:31,910
I raised a son too.

1048
01:16:33,050 --> 01:16:37,330
It may be hard to believe, but he was quite similar to
Atreus at this age.

1049
01:16:37,450 --> 01:16:38,350
Alright, guys, I got it.

1050
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:39,830
He adored his father.

1051
01:16:40,570 --> 01:16:42,310
Always wanted to do right by him.

1052
01:16:43,090 --> 01:16:50,950
was constantly frustrated that no matter what he did he
never could seem to get his approval he confided in me a lot

1053
01:16:50,950 --> 01:17:01,630
sought the comfort his father withheld oh my god it's over
there he has befriended the other dwarf the blue ones

1054
01:17:01,630 --> 01:17:09,310
brother oh well if cindry has that covered i suppose there's
no need for me in his life anymore is there that is not what

1055
01:17:09,310 --> 01:17:15,390
i mean sarcasm She's like, he chose he chose a dwarf over
her.

1056
01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:17,890
I mean, she was trying to kill him, though.

1057
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:21,930
Alright.

1058
01:17:23,370 --> 01:17:25,450
So there is red binds over there.

1059
01:17:25,510 --> 01:17:26,550
Can I even see that?

1060
01:17:26,830 --> 01:17:27,370
Oh, I can.

1061
01:17:27,530 --> 01:17:27,750
Okay.

1062
01:17:29,170 --> 01:17:29,770
Uh.

1063
01:17:30,770 --> 01:17:32,570
Can I reach that, though?

1064
01:17:34,490 --> 01:17:35,850
I don't think I can, right?

1065
01:17:37,710 --> 01:17:38,750
Let's see.

1066
01:17:41,550 --> 01:17:52,590

1068
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:09,630
Does that hit?

1069
01:18:12,590 --> 01:18:14,250
Oh my god.

1070
01:18:14,530 --> 01:18:15,550
Where does...

1071
01:18:15,550 --> 01:18:15,950
Alright.

1072
01:18:17,330 --> 01:18:18,850
We do here.

1073
01:18:20,670 --> 01:18:21,490
Here.

1074
01:18:23,670 --> 01:18:25,110
And then here.

1075
01:18:25,710 --> 01:18:26,190
There you go.

1076
01:18:26,830 --> 01:18:27,530
That should work.

1077
01:18:32,670 --> 01:18:35,150
How does that not reach it?

1078
01:18:35,370 --> 01:18:37,570
The circles were connecting!

1079
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:45,920
Okay.

1080
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:49,060
And then we'll do one here.

1081
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:52,460
That looks like it's connected, right?

1082
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:00,920
They're definitely touching!

1083
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:05,620
Is it not?

1084
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:07,420
Oh, it's not.

1085
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:09,460
Oh, no, it's not.

1086
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:13,860
Okay, and then...

1087
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:34,210
you think they're touching now I can't tell okay oh my god I
got one two but not the three yeah but doesn't it only make

1088
01:19:34,210 --> 01:19:49,360
it bigger like three times like that yeah and then if I do
it here yeah see all right here we go Oh, here it is.

1089
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:54,670
Okay, it's still not touched.

1090
01:19:54,930 --> 01:19:56,490
God, fucking stupid rock.

1091
01:20:07,890 --> 01:20:10,930
All right, that looks like a very big circle.

1092
01:20:11,970 --> 01:20:13,410
And then we put one here.

1093
01:20:14,990 --> 01:20:17,330
And then one here.

1094
01:20:18,050 --> 01:20:19,510
And then it should cut.

1095
01:20:19,710 --> 01:20:20,670
Oh, does it look like?

1096
01:20:20,810 --> 01:20:21,950
Oh my God, never mind.

1097
01:20:22,090 --> 01:20:22,670
It disappeared.

1098
01:20:23,030 --> 01:20:25,030
All right, and then...

1099
01:20:26,710 --> 01:20:28,870
One, two, three.

1100
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:29,270
There you go.

1101
01:20:29,350 --> 01:20:29,630
There you go.

1102
01:20:29,710 --> 01:20:30,050
There you go.

1103
01:20:30,990 --> 01:20:31,110
Made it.

1104
01:20:31,130 --> 01:20:31,630
We made it.

1105
01:20:33,350 --> 01:20:34,810
That should connect now.

1106
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:44,160
Oh, each rune can get... Okay, it's like... I figured it
out.

1107
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:44,700
I figured it out.

1108
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:45,460
Watch this.

1109
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:49,500
One, two, three.

1110
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:55,320
One, two, three.

1111
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:58,080
Now, now it'll touch.

1112
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:00,300
There's no way this doesn't touch.

1113
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:11,190
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

1114
01:21:11,310 --> 01:21:12,210
I figured it out.

1115
01:21:13,870 --> 01:21:15,890
One, two, three.

1116
01:21:16,770 --> 01:21:20,070
And now, there's no way they don't touch now.

1117

No, it gives a sparring!

1137
01:23:42,630 --> 01:23:43,350
God!

1138
01:23:46,410 --> 01:23:47,830
She has a cooldown!

1139
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:50,590
She has a cooldown!

1140
01:23:50,950 --> 01:23:52,730
Can't go much faster!

1141
01:23:58,120 --> 01:23:59,680
Oh my god, please.

01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:01,280
Please.

Okay.

1144
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:06,680
That has to touch.

1145
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:17,040
Look, CC, she doesn't care how long it took.

1146
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:17,760
We made it.

1147
01:24:18,020 --> 01:24:18,640
She didn't care.

1148
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:19,880
She's like, you know what?

1149
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:22,060
You did the best you could.

1150
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:23,180
I'm like, thank you.

1151
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:26,820
She didn't care.

1152
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:30,000
It's all about the end, not the journey.

1153
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:33,520
It's all about the end result, guys.

1154
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:34,800
She didn't care.

1155
01:24:35,340 --> 01:24:37,440
She complimented me, too.

1156
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:40,580
You know, I would have beaten you.

1157
01:24:41,020 --> 01:24:41,280
What?

1158
01:24:41,780 --> 01:24:45,460
earlier if it's on this yeah

1159
01:24:50,820 --> 01:25:06,620
perhaps see guys she complimented me i would rather not i'll
bet you wouldn't all right let's go okay it's this way we

1160
01:25:06,620 --> 01:25:15,540
have all right is it this way yeah it is The closer we get,
the more tightness grows in my chest.

1161
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:15,780
I'm in.

1162
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:16,920
See, she doesn't care.

1163
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:19,220
She looks past over my faults.

1164
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:21,540
It must be done.

1165
01:25:22,420 --> 01:25:24,380
I've lived with this pain far too long.

1166
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:28,660
If you can believe it, we were happy once.

1167
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:29,640
Really?

1168
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:31,420
Like what?

1169
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:32,720
For like 10 minutes?

1170
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:35,500
Perhaps that was my mistake.

1171
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:38,460
All I wanted was to protect my family.

1172
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:40,520
There is no shame in that.

1173
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:41,700
I failed.

1174
01:25:41,780 --> 01:25:50,600

Lundas or.

1178
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:20,240
Be cautious.

1179
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:22,300
We know not what it does.

1180
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:25,960
You really think she'd send us again the bloody thing if it
was going to kill us?

1181
01:26:26,580 --> 01:26:27,860
Let's just take it back to her.

1182
01:26:29,980 --> 01:26:30,440
Alright.

1183
01:26:30,860 --> 01:26:31,500
Oh, this.

1184
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:32,720
I don't know how to do this part.

1185
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:35,020
Okay, not that part, though.

1186
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:37,060
Interesting.

1187
01:26:37,460 --> 01:26:38,200
Are you serious?

1188
01:26:38,340 --> 01:26:39,360
Oh, my God.

1189
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:40,040
Not again.

1190
01:26:40,540 --> 01:26:41,340
Oh, no.

1191
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:43,340
Okay.

1192
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:45,360
Wait, how do I read?

1193
01:26:45,380 --> 01:26:57,300

don't wait it doesn't even burn it

1195
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:27,940
Does it burn this?

1196
01:27:28,180 --> 01:27:28,480
No.

1197
01:27:29,820 --> 01:27:31,480
Okay, that makes no sense.

1198
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:33,360
How the fuck does that not burn anything?

1199
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:35,620
It's literally a bomb.

1200
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:38,700
Okay, but does that hit the other one, though?

1201
01:27:42,550 --> 01:27:43,670
What about this?

1202
01:27:45,150 --> 01:27:46,690
Oh, it does hit it.

1203
01:27:46,870 --> 01:27:47,130
Okay.

1204
01:27:49,370 --> 01:27:50,850
Okay, I figured it out.

1205
01:28:02,750 --> 01:28:03,790
Come on.

1206
01:28:04,430 --> 01:28:05,350
Alright, there we go.

1207
01:28:13,390 --> 01:28:14,350
And then...

1208
01:28:14,350 --> 01:28:14,910
One more!

1209
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:21,800
How the fuck did that not burn it?

1210
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:23,860
Did I do it?

1211
01:28:25,180 --> 01:28:26,320
What the fuck?

1212
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:29,160
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1213
01:28:29,260 --> 01:28:29,660

1214
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:30,360
I'm cooking.

1215
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:33,960
Wait, can I throw it from here?

1216
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:36,880
Okay.

1217
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:38,880
Not really.

1218
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:41,980
Oh.

1219
01:28:43,820 --> 01:28:53,750

Oh my, we don't need that.

1225
01:29:30,210 --> 01:29:31,410
It's alright, guys.

1226
01:29:31,930 --> 01:29:33,890
That item might not be important, anyway.

1227
01:29:35,350 --> 01:29:35,930
It's okay.

1228
01:29:36,450 --> 01:29:38,150
I think the item is not that important.

1229
01:29:40,590 --> 01:29:41,810
There's no way.

1230
01:29:43,090 --> 01:29:44,530
The Veiled Passage.

1231
01:29:45,910 --> 01:29:46,210
Alright.

1232
01:29:48,210 --> 01:29:50,330
I'm pretty sure that item wasn't that important.

1233
01:29:50,350 --> 01:29:58,950
important but what what what if it is no no i'm pretty sure
it's all right i'm pretty sure that item wasn't even that

01:29:58,950 --> 01:30:12,200

just like that that's all linda's armor taking care of yeah

1235
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:14,700

1236
01:30:19,420 --> 01:30:25,960
but can i destroy that Arrows won't work on this.

1237
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:29,700
This is destroyable, right?

1238
01:30:39,070 --> 01:30:39,990
Uh...

1239
01:30:44,430 --> 01:30:45,350
No?

1240
01:30:45,730 --> 01:30:46,050
Okay.

1241
01:30:47,330 --> 01:30:48,130
It's not that.

1242
01:30:50,930 --> 01:30:51,850
Uh...

1243
01:30:51,850 --> 01:30:53,910

1244
01:31:05,180 --> 01:31:06,220

No, okay.

1248
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,160
No kapom, I guess.

1249
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:16,720
I don't know how to break that.

1250
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:18,640
Arrow press freeze.

1251
01:31:18,820 --> 01:31:20,180
Can I freeze it?

1252
01:31:35,230 --> 01:31:36,430
Oh, yay!

1253
01:31:39,130 --> 01:31:40,370
Not kapom.

1254
01:31:40,570 --> 01:31:41,470
It was kapom.

1255
01:31:42,210 --> 01:31:44,050
All right.

1256
01:31:44,490 --> 01:31:45,590

01:32:24,050 --> 01:32:25,510
It's red paint instead.

1262
01:32:26,770 --> 01:32:28,230
Red and white paint.

1263
01:32:29,410 --> 01:32:30,850

Money is money.

Wait, what?

Okay, I'm gonna say, where was the shortcut I made?

1269
01:32:40,310 --> 01:32:41,350
Oh, time to read!

1270
01:32:43,110 --> 01:32:44,610
Just reading is fundamental.

1271
01:32:45,250 --> 01:32:46,470
Anything interesting, brother?

1272
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:57,200
Give me a sec real quick.

1273
01:32:57,620 --> 01:33:00,040
Let me double check something real quick.

1274
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:01,640
Boop.

1275
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:04,780
Oh.

1276
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,380
I had to check my messages.

1277
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:11,060
Ah, work stuff in behind the scenes.

1278
01:33:12,260 --> 01:33:12,900
Over there.

1279
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:15,560
February truly is hell month.

1280
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:16,820
Uh.

1281
01:33:17,620 --> 01:33:18,220
Are they friendly?

1282
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:20,180
They were very friendly anymore, do they?

1283
01:33:20,780 --> 01:33:22,120
Let us put them to rest.

1284
01:33:23,060 --> 01:33:23,440
Alright.

1285
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:24,720
Oh.

1286
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:27,120
Here you go, I did it!

1287
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:28,880
Oh, he's like, what happened to this guy?

1288
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:35,100
He's just like, wait, what happened to him?

1289
01:33:38,540 --> 01:33:39,420
That's crazy.

1290
01:33:40,620 --> 01:33:42,640
Wait, don't worry, you can't block his feet.

1291
01:33:42,780 --> 01:33:44,100
Yeah, I fucking do it.

1292
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:47,500
That's right, get out of here.

1293
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:49,080
Can't block that.

1294
01:33:50,540 --> 01:33:52,180
It must have been the win.

1295
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:54,300
He's like, what happened to that guy?

1296
01:33:55,900 --> 01:33:58,880
Oh well, not my problem.

1297
01:34:00,020 --> 01:34:01,840
It must have been the wind.

1298
01:34:06,940 --> 01:34:07,660
Up I go.

1299
01:34:08,700 --> 01:34:09,480
We should get moving.

1300
01:34:11,140 --> 01:34:12,100
Oh, I see you.

1301
01:34:12,740 --> 01:34:13,660
Fool me once.

1302
01:34:14,260 --> 01:34:15,320
Shame on me.

1303
01:34:16,540 --> 01:34:17,960
Fool me twice.

1304
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:19,980
Maybe shame on me again.

1305
01:34:20,620 --> 01:34:22,120
Because I have no pattern recognition.

1306
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:25,360
Oh shit!

1307
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:29,440
Bro, that guy just ran in.

1308
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:34,720
Like, where the fuck did that guy come from?

1309
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:38,010
There we go.

1310
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:41,560
Nice.

1311
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:45,880
I froze him so hard, he disappeared.

1312
01:34:50,140 --> 01:34:51,500
What the fuck?

1313
01:34:53,380 --> 01:34:55,180
Okay, I have, like...

Like, what the fuck am I supposed to do?

1319
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:15,820
Oh, that's not what I wanted to do.

Did I freed her friends?

1370
01:39:23,430 --> 01:39:24,710
I've lost track.

1371
01:39:24,950 --> 01:39:26,590
There's so many side quests.

1372
01:39:31,070 --> 01:39:31,850
Do I do it?

1373
01:39:32,190 --> 01:39:33,930
Can you be put to rest now?

1374
01:39:35,870 --> 01:39:37,430
Can you move on?

1375
01:39:38,010 --> 01:39:38,790
I don't know.

1376
01:39:38,850 --> 01:39:39,830
Oh, yes, I did it.

1377
01:39:40,070 --> 01:39:40,330
It's done.

1378
01:39:40,850 --> 01:39:41,150
I did.

1379
01:39:41,250 --> 01:39:42,050
I killed your friends.

1380
01:39:43,470 --> 01:39:43,950
And...

1381
01:39:43,950 --> 01:39:44,690
I'm sorry.

1382
01:39:44,910 --> 01:39:45,030
Okay.

1383
01:39:45,050 --> 01:39:46,430
But I've been here.

1384
01:39:46,570 --> 01:39:48,290
I would have prevented this.

1385
01:39:48,410 --> 01:39:49,290
Do you think us lie?

1386
01:39:49,450 --> 01:39:51,910
I didn't blow my nose and capable of making our own choices.

1387
01:39:52,590 --> 01:39:53,770
No, but we made a mistake.

1388
01:39:54,730 --> 01:39:55,810
But it was ours to make.

1389
01:39:56,790 --> 01:39:57,830
Not yours to prevent.

1390
01:39:58,610 --> 01:39:59,870
Even if you had been here.

1391
01:40:00,910 --> 01:40:03,770
I... Yes, you're right.

1392
01:40:04,990 --> 01:40:05,450
Goodbye.

1393
01:40:06,290 --> 01:40:07,990
Goodbye, my gods.

1394
01:40:08,770 --> 01:40:09,350
Bye-bye.

1395
01:40:09,970 --> 01:40:10,970
I did my job.

1396
01:40:11,470 --> 01:40:11,770
Kratos.

1397
01:40:13,290 --> 01:40:13,390
Yeah?

1398
01:40:13,390 --> 01:40:15,030
Thank you for taking the time to help me.

01:40:15,050 --> 01:40:23,550

1400
01:40:23,550 --> 01:40:33,510

will not last you're right there are most certainly other

1401
01:40:33,510 --> 01:40:44,070

end on a cheery note brother um did i wish that what did i i

1402
01:40:44,070 --> 01:40:50,170
wish that grabbing that for us all right here's the orb

1403
01:40:53,370 --> 01:41:12,420
oh thank you so much is that a fucking squeaker toy that's
what the orb was what all right oh my god oh my god i was

1404
01:41:12,420 --> 01:41:19,300
just trying to find a dog toy we could have just made her a
new dog toy the squeaky toy could have been the death of us

1405
01:41:19,300 --> 01:41:32,180
all and it nearly was do not laugh that's hard not to try
okay okay all right at least i got armor though it fits nice

1406
01:41:32,180 --> 01:41:43,120
okay but there is only one thing there's only one concern
that i have it covers up the nipple but don't worry i can

1407
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:52,280
fix that i can always free the nipple there we go

1408
01:41:55,850 --> 01:41:56,370
Freedom!

1409
01:41:59,810 --> 01:42:00,930
Okay, now where are we?

1410
01:42:01,270 --> 01:42:04,510
On this one side quest that we've been on.

1411
01:42:05,390 --> 01:42:06,470
Alright, we need...

1412
01:42:06,470 --> 01:42:08,290
Okay, wait, actually, we gotta upgrade too.

1413
01:42:09,170 --> 01:42:10,150
I'm gonna grab that.

1414
01:42:10,750 --> 01:42:11,330
And that.

1415
01:42:12,050 --> 01:42:12,690
And that.

1416
01:42:13,350 --> 01:42:13,610
And that.

1417
01:42:13,610 --> 01:42:14,110
And that.

1418
01:42:15,270 --> 01:42:17,390
I assume they're very good upgrades.

1419
01:42:18,530 --> 01:42:21,550
Press L while barehanded to quickly recall...

1420
01:42:21,550 --> 01:42:23,150
Oh, wait, that is pretty neat.

1421
01:42:25,110 --> 01:42:27,890
to consume the meter and activate enhances.

1422
01:42:28,350 --> 01:42:28,370
Oh!

1423
01:42:30,330 --> 01:42:32,390
Okay, that's pretty neat too.

1424
01:42:32,670 --> 01:42:34,190
Arfreya, your turn.

1425
01:42:34,610 --> 01:42:36,110
How does she go Valkyrie mode?

1426
01:42:36,190 --> 01:42:39,210
Does she just do it herself?

1427
01:42:39,790 --> 01:42:39,790
Like,

1428
01:42:44,720 --> 01:42:48,160
does it, like, activate on her own?

1429
01:42:48,860 --> 01:42:50,640
Because I'm, like, confused a little bit.

1430
01:42:51,340 --> 01:42:52,620
Oh, she does it randomly.

1431
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:53,060
Okay.

1432
01:42:53,460 --> 01:42:56,080
I was, like, wondering, how does that even happen?

1433
01:42:56,960 --> 01:42:58,020
Why would I go here?

1434
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:01,460
Is this way?

1435
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:06,160
Is this way?

1436
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:10,000
Freya, there's something I've always wanted to ask.

1437
01:43:10,840 --> 01:43:11,400
What was it?

1438
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:13,000
Z-Closs, welcome to Tomato Club.

1439
01:43:13,340 --> 01:43:13,720
Welcome, welcome.

1440
01:43:14,120 --> 01:43:14,800
The tomato farm.

1441
01:43:15,260 --> 01:43:16,240
Welcome, welcome.

1442
01:43:18,460 --> 01:43:19,740
I'm going tired.

1443
01:43:20,780 --> 01:43:22,500
Oh, yes.

1444
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:27,640
One of the many occasions Odin saw I really want to go to
Tomato Club.

1445
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:29,060
I'm Miss Tomato.

1446
01:43:29,160 --> 01:43:32,720
I wish I could say that was the worst of his husbandly
habits.

1447
01:43:33,560 --> 01:43:33,860
What wager?

1448
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:36,140
I've told this story, brother.

1449
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:38,060
And now she may tell her own.

1450
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:40,460
There isn't that much to tell.

1451
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:45,300
I knew nothing of it at first, surely because Odin didn't
expect to lose the bet.

1452
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:51,100
A mysterious mason had to build the entire wall in three
turns of the season.

1453
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:51,460
Two!

1454
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:52,420
It was two!

1455
01:43:52,540 --> 01:43:55,000
And if he was late, he'd be owed nothing.

1456
01:43:55,560 --> 01:43:59,140
But if he succeeded, he was promised an audience with the
Queen.

1457
01:43:59,160 --> 01:43:59,900
A queen?

1458
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:00,140
A queen?

1459
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:06,460
Or so I learned one day when Odin burst into our
bedchambers, raging and half-drunk before noon, telling me

1460
01:44:06,460 --> 01:44:08,720
to get dressed and go see what the mason wants.

1461
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:14,060
So off I went, not knowing what had truly been promised or
expected.

1462
01:44:14,440 --> 01:44:16,520
Dagger stashed in my robe for emergency.

1463
01:44:17,540 --> 01:44:21,300
And this mason, this giant in disguise...

1464
01:44:21,300 --> 01:44:22,860
His name was Hremthor!

1465
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:27,540
He just smiled to see me, and as you said, he whispered in
my ear.

1466
01:44:29,160 --> 01:44:34,620
Aseer had killed his father, and he needed to know that one
day they'd burn for it.

1467
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:38,240
I pointed out I was Aseer now, too, technically.

1468
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:42,760
He gave me a look, as if he somehow knew better and
continued.

1469
01:44:43,660 --> 01:44:48,160
He said he'd built in a structural flaw behind the Asgard
Realm Tower.

1470
01:44:48,540 --> 01:44:49,480
I knew it!

1471
01:44:49,860 --> 01:44:51,140
How do we make use of it?

1472
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:52,400
We don't.

1473
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:54,000
It's like the Death Star!

1474
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:55,920
Yeah, there's a hole!

1475
01:44:56,340 --> 01:45:00,240
And if Serder's approaching Asgard's wall, Oh.

1476
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:06,940
Oh, it didn't matter.

1477
01:45:08,440 --> 01:45:10,460
They already started anyway.

1478
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:14,680
All right, don't worry.

1479
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:17,740
I have a giant axe.

1480
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:20,280
Oh, my God.

1481
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:21,320
Oh, my God.

1482
01:45:21,400 --> 01:45:22,440
I did not like the sound of that.

1483
01:45:24,420 --> 01:45:25,220
What the fuck?

1484
01:45:25,260 --> 01:45:26,700
It interrupted my combo!

1485
01:45:27,220 --> 01:45:28,160
It can do that!

1486
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:30,560
Bro!

1487
01:45:32,900 --> 01:45:34,940
That wolf interrupted my combo!

1488
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:36,880
That's cheating!

1489
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:41,020
Don't just fucking interrupt the man's combo!

1490
01:45:43,340 --> 01:45:44,440
Oh shit.

1491
01:45:46,220 --> 01:45:47,380
Everyone used the...

1492
01:45:50,180 --> 01:45:51,340
That's crazy.

1493
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:56,860
Oh my god.

1494
01:45:57,180 --> 01:45:57,580
Oh my god!

1495
01:45:57,680 --> 01:45:59,080
I swear to god I used my shield.

1496
01:46:01,180 --> 01:46:03,320
Please go into Valkyrie farm!

1497
01:46:03,860 --> 01:46:07,380
I don't understand why you're able to do that when you fight
me!

1498
01:46:09,300 --> 01:46:10,600
There we go.

1499
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:17,220
Like when she's fucking beating shit out of me, she went
full Valkyrie.

1500
01:46:17,460 --> 01:46:20,700
But for these guys, she's like, well, nah, where's it?

1501
01:46:26,820 --> 01:46:27,260
Here we go.

1502
01:46:27,260 --> 01:46:29,020
I'll go this way.

1503
01:46:31,560 --> 01:46:32,340
What the way?

1504
01:46:34,580 --> 01:46:42,760
like i don't understand when she was valkyrie mode she beat
the shit of me but she won't use it here we're getting our

1505
01:46:42,760 --> 01:46:47,220
shit kicked in well i was getting my shit kicked in she was
just watching

1506
01:46:50,260 --> 01:46:55,960
yeah boss when you fight them versus the bot versus when you
unlock them as a playable character

1507
01:47:01,180 --> 01:47:02,360
i don't know if i got it

1508
01:47:05,500 --> 01:47:12,680
must be something i can collab all right where's the white
paint oh there it is the red paint i knew i was like where's

1509
01:47:12,680 --> 01:47:23,860
the red paint there's wet red paint somewhere only a hunch
he showed me who he really was odin asked me to cast a

1510
01:47:23,860 --> 01:47:35,200
protection spell on him the one i used on my son but the way
it drove our boy mad i refused he was furious throwing every

1511
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:38,680
object he could find destroyed the river I'm such a kid.

1512
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:40,720
It was only coldness after that.

1513
01:47:42,180 --> 01:47:43,380
I tried to make it work.

1514
01:47:44,260 --> 01:47:46,020
No one could have lived like that, Your Majesty.

1515
01:47:46,380 --> 01:47:48,820
Wait, who did she want to cast the spell on?

1516
01:47:49,660 --> 01:47:52,040
Like, who did Odin wanted the spell to be used on?

1517
01:47:53,780 --> 01:47:55,720
Guys, think of the Super Chat thinking, thank you.

1518
01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:57,720
To be fair, those guys didn't kill you.

1519
01:47:57,800 --> 01:47:58,820
Okay, true, true.

1520
01:47:59,160 --> 01:48:00,100
That's a fair point.

1521
01:48:00,500 --> 01:48:03,560
But they could, they could, she could channel that anger.

1522
01:48:04,640 --> 01:48:06,100
Oh, on himself.

1523
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:06,920
Oh.

1524
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:14,320
I think it would have made him like A more fucked up person
Yeah

1525
01:48:17,680 --> 01:48:25,340
Wanted to live forever Oh I see Yeah but she said Like you
know the challenge I hate of me killing her son To like

1526
01:48:25,340 --> 01:48:40,940
those guys instead Channel it healthily In a healthy way
Look Over there Look where Where Where Oh.

1527
01:48:43,680 --> 01:48:45,100
Oh, she's over here.

1528
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:48,940
I feel like there's something in here.

1529
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:50,900
But, like, how do I actually...

1530
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:53,020
How do I open that?

1531
01:48:56,440 --> 01:48:58,300
There is something in here.

1532
01:48:59,060 --> 01:49:00,700
How the fuck do you open that?

1533
01:49:02,840 --> 01:49:03,400
There?

1534
01:49:03,560 --> 01:49:04,520
Oh, it is pretty.

1535
01:49:08,680 --> 01:49:09,240
Okay.

1536
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:12,700
Arrow than axe?

1537
01:49:17,050 --> 01:49:19,770
The freeze!

1538
01:49:22,470 --> 01:49:24,410
It's gone.

1539
01:49:27,010 --> 01:49:28,670
Where did he go?

1540
01:49:30,570 --> 01:49:31,270
Oops.

1541
01:49:34,410 --> 01:49:35,630
Oopsie.

1542
01:49:36,290 --> 01:49:38,490
Does that

1543
01:49:42,740 --> 01:49:43,260
reach it?

1544
01:49:52,050 --> 01:49:52,650
No.

1545
01:49:52,970 --> 01:49:53,470
Okay, wait.

1546
01:50:01,620 --> 01:50:02,500
Not one more.

1547
01:50:03,580 --> 01:50:04,880
Does that reach it?

1548
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:07,400
No?

1549
01:50:07,660 --> 01:50:08,240
Oh, fuck.

1550
01:50:08,500 --> 01:50:08,780
Okay, wait.

1551
01:50:09,460 --> 01:50:10,160
Can I reach that?

1552
01:50:10,460 --> 01:50:10,760
No.

1553
01:50:16,630 --> 01:50:17,430
Oh, my God.

1554
01:50:17,590 --> 01:50:17,930
Not again.

1555
01:50:22,630 --> 01:50:23,510
All right, hero.

1556
01:50:26,750 --> 01:50:27,950
God, fucking...

1557
01:50:27,950 --> 01:50:28,830
Oh, my God.

1558
01:50:28,970 --> 01:50:29,730

1562
01:51:13,260 --> 01:51:14,200
Oh my god.

1563
01:51:23,170 --> 01:51:24,090
There we go.

1564
01:51:24,710 --> 01:51:25,610
Just one more.

1565
01:51:26,090 --> 01:51:27,170
Where's the last pot?

1566
01:51:37,260 --> 01:51:39,040
This is how we got here.

1567
01:51:40,340 --> 01:51:42,140
Where the fuck is the last one?

1568
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:45,960
Oh, is it that?

1569
01:51:48,200 --> 01:51:49,460
I can't tell.

1570
01:51:49,600 --> 01:51:50,880
Is that a pot up there?

1571
01:51:55,710 --> 01:51:56,330
Is it that?

1572
01:52:01,240 --> 01:52:01,940
Does it look like?

1573
01:52:02,040 --> 01:52:02,720
No, not that.

1574
01:52:02,860 --> 01:52:03,100
Okay.

1575
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:06,560
Where the fuck is the last one?

1576
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:20,220
I swear to God if it's like gamers don't look up situation.

1577
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:21,560
I swear to fucking God.

1578
01:52:22,460 --> 01:52:23,480
Oh there it is.

1579
01:52:24,100 --> 01:52:25,360
I fucking knew it.

1580
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:26,520
I fucking knew it.

1581
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:28,420
It's always gamers don't look up.

1582
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:32,420
I hit that?

1583
01:52:33,640 --> 01:52:34,240
I do.

1584
01:52:34,540 --> 01:52:34,820
Okay.

1585
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:36,560
Okay.

1586
01:52:38,740 --> 01:52:40,820
Didn't I hit that, right?

1587
01:52:44,680 --> 01:52:45,900
God damn it.

1588
01:52:46,020 --> 01:52:46,200
Okay.

1589
01:52:46,980 --> 01:52:47,640
Maybe up here?

1590
01:52:50,040 --> 01:52:51,620
I hit those?

1591
01:52:57,620 --> 01:52:58,300
There we go.

1592
01:52:59,620 --> 01:53:00,620
I do hit those.

1593
01:53:01,980 --> 01:53:02,600
All right, nice.

1594
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:03,160
Free loot!

1595
01:53:04,680 --> 01:53:05,020
Yay!

1596
01:53:07,380 --> 01:53:08,440
Another alpha.

1597
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:12,020
Okay, nice.

1598
01:53:12,240 --> 01:53:13,160
I got more apples.

1599
01:53:15,720 --> 01:53:20,060
I will say the puzzles are getting a little bit more
obnoxious.

1600
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:25,460
They're getting a little bit more fucked up.

1601
01:53:38,990 --> 01:53:39,370
Yeah!

1602
01:53:40,630 --> 01:53:42,670
I never thought I'd come back here.

1603
01:53:46,190 --> 01:53:46,610
Huh?

1604
01:53:47,950 --> 01:53:48,590
Huh?

1605
01:53:49,490 --> 01:53:50,910
The Venier Shrine.

1606
01:53:51,090 --> 01:53:52,230
Wait, how did they get in here?

1607
01:53:52,850 --> 01:53:53,590
That's not fair.

1608
01:53:53,770 --> 01:53:54,970
I thought we were here first.

1609
01:53:55,190 --> 01:53:56,870
Reverse, of course.

1610
01:53:59,510 --> 01:54:01,870
I was gonna say, I don't fuck this.

1611
01:54:01,910 --> 01:54:03,150
Oh, shit!

1612
01:54:03,510 --> 01:54:04,530
It doesn't belong here.

1613
01:54:04,650 --> 01:54:05,870
We must get rid of it.

1614
01:54:06,750 --> 01:54:08,270
Okay, but how did he get in here?

1615
01:54:08,390 --> 01:54:10,130
Okay, um, this is a little awkward.

1616
01:54:11,230 --> 01:54:12,290
Oh, he's crawling.

1617
01:54:12,570 --> 01:54:15,870
He's walking very slowly towards me.

1618
01:54:16,450 --> 01:54:17,170
Yeah, right.

01:54:19,590 --> 01:54:28,830

My hands are cold!

1629
01:55:55,730 --> 01:55:56,750
There you go.

My hands are too cold!

1634
01:56:10,230 --> 01:56:11,410
Okay, that's good, that's fine.

1635
01:56:17,210 --> 01:56:18,590
Does this block it?

1636
01:56:19,190 --> 01:56:20,090
Don't worry, I'm blocking it.

1637
01:56:20,110 --> 01:56:21,170
I'm blocking it.

1638
01:56:21,830 --> 01:56:23,150
Okay, that's fine.

1639
01:56:26,050 --> 01:56:28,410
Open, open, open.

1640
01:56:29,070 --> 01:56:29,390
Boom!

1641
01:56:30,650 --> 01:56:31,670
Okay, that didn't matter.

1642
01:56:33,710 --> 01:56:34,630
All right, nice.

1643
01:56:36,010 --> 01:56:37,570
Yeah, we did it.

1644
01:56:38,730 --> 01:56:40,450
Fucking right, get out of here.

1645
01:56:41,590 --> 01:56:42,230
This place.

1646
01:56:43,290 --> 01:56:44,470
That used to be sacred.

1647
01:56:45,590 --> 01:56:46,970
Now it sits abandoned.

1648
01:56:48,090 --> 01:56:48,530
Vandalized.

1649
01:56:50,530 --> 01:56:52,670
Hopefully the objects I'm looking for are still here.

1650
01:56:53,170 --> 01:56:54,890
Yeah, hopefully, whatever the fuck it is.

1651
01:56:55,310 --> 01:56:56,890
Made me go all the way here for it.

1652
01:56:57,310 --> 01:57:02,370
I could be on the main storyline right now, but they told
me, they told me you'll be super strong if I do this.

1653
01:57:05,450 --> 01:57:06,750
Roy, welcome to Tomato Canal!

1654
01:57:06,910 --> 01:57:07,550

1661
01:58:01,310 --> 01:58:02,030
God damn it.

1662
01:58:02,090 --> 01:58:03,150
Okay, not there.

1663
01:58:10,450 --> 01:58:11,410
There we go.

1664
01:58:14,410 --> 01:58:15,010
Nice.

1665
01:58:18,990 --> 01:58:19,610
There we go.

1666
01:58:20,150 --> 01:58:20,890
Where's the other one?

1667
01:58:22,070 --> 01:58:22,770
What the fuck?

1668
01:58:22,930 --> 01:58:23,450
Where's the other?

1669
01:58:23,790 --> 01:58:25,750
I guess I have to go to the other side.

1670
01:58:27,030 --> 01:58:28,670
Kratos, I see something.

1671
01:58:28,790 --> 01:58:29,330
What do you see?

1672
01:58:31,250 --> 01:58:32,930
Okay, explain.

1673
01:58:33,670 --> 01:58:35,230
Like, all right.

1674
01:58:35,830 --> 01:58:40,150
Maybe if you could explain what you see instead of saying
words, woman.

1675
01:58:41,550 --> 01:58:43,330
Describe what you see.

1676
01:58:47,570 --> 01:58:49,090
Verbalize your thoughts.

1677
01:58:50,270 --> 01:58:50,790
Please.

1678
01:58:53,430 --> 01:58:53,730
Oh.

1679
01:58:56,510 --> 01:58:58,390
No, I don't think I will.

1680
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,040
So much about that day, I wish I could change.

1681
01:59:05,060 --> 01:59:06,460
If only I've seen the signs.

1682
01:59:08,600 --> 01:59:09,500
Where's the mother?

1683
01:59:10,380 --> 01:59:10,840
Motherflower.

1684
01:59:11,960 --> 01:59:13,700
Or is it just there to be an asshole?

1685
01:59:19,570 --> 01:59:20,450
Second rut.

1686
01:59:20,690 --> 01:59:21,730
Get shielded.

1687
01:59:24,610 --> 01:59:25,450
Oh, there it is.

1688
01:59:25,630 --> 01:59:26,150
Give me a sec.

1689
01:59:28,930 --> 01:59:29,570
It's fine.

1690
01:59:29,770 --> 01:59:31,190
That's the risk I'm willing to take.

1691
01:59:34,450 --> 01:59:36,110
Are you fucking Okan?

1692
01:59:38,450 --> 01:59:39,070
Alright, that's fine.

1693
01:59:40,690 --> 01:59:41,510
Oh my god, I didn't mean to do that.

1694
01:59:41,570 --> 01:59:41,950
Oh, it's fine.

1695
01:59:42,110 --> 01:59:42,550
That's fine.

1696
01:59:43,950 --> 01:59:45,510
I actually meant to do that.

1697
01:59:49,710 --> 01:59:50,110
Alright.

1698
01:59:51,050 --> 01:59:51,850
Give me your loot.

1699
01:59:54,370 --> 01:59:55,170
Anything else?

1700
01:59:58,070 --> 02:00:00,110
Oh, what are you looking at?

1701
02:00:00,770 --> 02:00:03,050
Oh, how do I get there?

1702
02:00:04,610 --> 02:00:05,550
Where's the red paint?

1703
02:00:06,750 --> 02:00:07,470
Red paint?

1704
02:00:07,830 --> 02:00:08,110
Doka?

1705
02:00:09,250 --> 02:00:09,510
Red paint?

1706
02:00:09,590 --> 02:00:10,730
Oh, reading time.

1707
02:00:13,130 --> 02:00:16,110
Guys, it doesn't seem like a 10-minute side quest anymore.

1708
02:00:16,890 --> 02:00:19,350
This doesn't seem like it.

1709
02:00:20,570 --> 02:00:23,230
I thought it was a quick in and out.

1710
02:00:24,750 --> 02:00:27,490
But I'm starting to believe it less and less.

1711
02:00:29,950 --> 02:00:46,590
that's it that's it you make daddy very angry get out of
here oh my god it's poison the crest of the hughley family

1712
02:00:46,590 --> 02:00:49,930
just the quick quest they said

1713
02:00:54,900 --> 02:00:58,080
all right i'm not feeling so good

1714
02:01:03,180 --> 02:01:06,000
My HP is very, very low.

1715
02:01:06,320 --> 02:01:09,440
It's on that pedestal by the balcony.

1716
02:01:10,140 --> 02:01:11,580
Yeah, you did not have to scream.

1717
02:01:13,020 --> 02:01:14,660
You really have to scream that?

1718
02:01:18,060 --> 02:01:21,480
Oh, I'm fucking, I hate that cheeky bullshit.

1719
02:01:22,160 --> 02:01:22,980
Fuck, damn it.

1720
02:01:23,720 --> 02:01:26,360
You think you're so good just because you have no magic!

1721
02:01:27,300 --> 02:01:28,800
You fight like a pussy!

1722
02:01:32,260 --> 02:01:35,180
Fight like a fucking pussy!

1723
02:01:36,460 --> 02:01:37,260
That's right, I said it.

1724
02:01:41,480 --> 02:01:42,220
Alright, nice.

1725
02:01:42,760 --> 02:01:43,280
Easy.

1726
02:01:45,380 --> 02:01:46,140
Look at this.

1727
02:01:46,580 --> 02:01:46,900
Alright, what?

1728
02:01:47,240 --> 02:01:47,320
This?

1729
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:49,760
What is this?

1730
02:01:54,080 --> 02:01:56,800
Is that your wedding crown?

1731
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:01,280
What is that?

1732
02:02:05,140 --> 02:02:05,860
Oh.

1733
02:02:06,900 --> 02:02:20,730
to you a symbol of commitment after the ceremony he had a
new one made every week oh that's romantic he stopped when i

1734
02:02:20,730 --> 02:02:29,270
refused to teach him the old magic oh my people used to send
me gifts too so i wouldn't forget home but after the birth

1735
02:02:29,270 --> 02:02:37,830
of my son they stopped too i mean that was pretty romantic
of him to do so you think about it

1736
02:02:42,360 --> 02:02:42,880
What?

1737
02:02:43,180 --> 02:02:44,960
Like, new crown every week?

1738
02:02:46,240 --> 02:02:49,960
It's like she's getting a new designer bag every week, if
you think about it.

1739
02:02:58,080 --> 02:02:58,200
Alright.

1740
02:02:59,500 --> 02:03:01,540
I learned the leather N.

1741
02:03:01,780 --> 02:03:03,520
Let's head back and I can take a better look.

1742
02:03:04,160 --> 02:03:05,740
How do I get down here?

1743
02:03:07,860 --> 02:03:09,460
And that's the leather N.

1744
02:03:14,200 --> 02:03:14,720
Oh?

1745
02:03:19,460 --> 02:03:31,540
a mega fire there we go i was gonna say what happened but i
feel nothing perhaps what you see cannot be found in a

1746
02:03:31,540 --> 02:03:33,340
circuit you may be right

1747
02:03:37,190 --> 02:03:44,470
oh oh oh didn't see these guys where did they come from i
was gonna say i don't know what did they get

1748
02:03:48,890 --> 02:03:49,390
That's right.

1749
02:03:49,550 --> 02:03:50,610
Get over here!

1750
02:03:51,110 --> 02:03:51,510
Yeah!

1751
02:03:52,550 --> 02:03:53,350
Get grabbed!

1752
02:03:54,470 --> 02:03:54,990
Is that it?

1753
02:03:55,350 --> 02:03:57,050
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1754
02:03:57,170 --> 02:03:57,770
That's a wolf.

1755
02:03:59,930 --> 02:04:00,730
That's right.

1756
02:04:03,190 --> 02:04:04,310
What's he gonna do, huh?

1757
02:04:04,470 --> 02:04:04,870
Nothing.

1758
02:04:05,230 --> 02:04:05,770
That's right.

1759
02:04:06,610 --> 02:04:08,070
You got slowly head, tummy.

1760
02:04:09,450 --> 02:04:10,190
Can't do shit.

1761
02:04:10,570 --> 02:04:10,990
You know what?

1762
02:04:11,050 --> 02:04:11,910
I have so much time.

1763
02:04:12,170 --> 02:04:12,650
Oh, shit!

1764
02:04:12,730 --> 02:04:13,250
He's getting closer!

1765
02:04:13,370 --> 02:04:13,730
It's okay.

1766
02:04:14,410 --> 02:04:14,930
That's right.

1767
02:04:15,790 --> 02:04:16,670
What's he gonna do?

1768
02:04:16,810 --> 02:04:17,350
Oh, shit!

1769
02:04:17,530 --> 02:04:18,270
Oh, shit!

1770
02:04:20,610 --> 02:04:22,390
They're slowly back away.

1771
02:04:28,480 --> 02:04:29,380
Okay, that's illegal.

1772
02:04:32,120 --> 02:04:34,140
Why did he broke my combo?

1773
02:04:35,660 --> 02:04:37,380
He can do that?

1774
02:04:40,850 --> 02:04:42,270
Oh, fuck.

1775
02:04:43,270 --> 02:04:43,790
That's right.

1776
02:04:43,910 --> 02:04:46,150
That's what I do for combo breakers.

1777
02:04:47,450 --> 02:04:49,710
You never break a man's combo.

1778
02:04:51,250 --> 02:04:53,090
That's the number one rule.

1779
02:04:56,330 --> 02:04:59,390
You never fuck over a man's combo.

1780
02:05:03,830 --> 02:05:05,430
Literally face off.

1781
02:05:06,790 --> 02:05:07,990
How do I get the other...

1782
02:05:07,990 --> 02:05:08,770
Oh, here you go.

1783
02:05:09,110 --> 02:05:09,530
Read.

1784
02:05:10,230 --> 02:05:11,350
The word isn't complete.

1785
02:05:11,690 --> 02:05:12,790
It's missing a piece.

1786
02:05:16,350 --> 02:05:17,410
What do I do?

1787
02:05:21,260 --> 02:05:22,700
What do I do, Zen?

1788
02:05:23,400 --> 02:05:25,080
I don't know what to do.

1789
02:05:25,900 --> 02:05:26,100
Yeah?

1790
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:28,920
The door is shut.

1791
02:05:30,060 --> 02:05:30,900
Memory serves.

1792
02:05:31,620 --> 02:05:34,100
We'll need to light both of those torches to open it.

1793
02:05:34,140 --> 02:05:35,360
Both of those torches?

1794
02:05:35,840 --> 02:05:36,580
Oh, these torches?

1795
02:05:36,920 --> 02:05:37,820
Oh, okay.

1796
02:05:39,160 --> 02:05:40,160
That's easy.

1797
02:05:42,280 --> 02:05:43,060
I got this.

1798
02:05:44,760 --> 02:05:45,960
Torch one.

1799
02:05:47,560 --> 02:05:48,900
This is a mystic fire.

1800
02:05:49,340 --> 02:05:50,700
Its flames are short-lived.

1801
02:05:52,900 --> 02:05:53,100
Oh.

1802
02:05:55,040 --> 02:05:55,680
Two.

1803
02:05:57,140 --> 02:05:58,340
Oh, shit.

1804
02:05:58,720 --> 02:05:59,360
Oh, did I do it?

1805
02:06:05,320 --> 02:06:11,220
that oh I have to do it at once maybe I have to do it both
at the same time

1806
02:06:15,770 --> 02:06:16,690
no wait

1807
02:06:20,760 --> 02:06:27,000
yeah I was gonna say I have to light it both at the same
time okay maybe I move it a bit more here

1808
02:06:32,190 --> 02:06:40,230
okay I fucked it up I gotta reset this alright give me a sec
I'm resetting the sigils I see something alright here we go

1809
02:06:40,230 --> 02:07:02,950
I reset it one two three one two three there you go oh what
can I grip though like there we Yay!

1810
02:07:05,490 --> 02:07:05,790
Yoink!

1811
02:07:06,570 --> 02:07:07,030
My loot.

1812
02:07:09,990 --> 02:07:12,850
Okay, but I didn't understand how short it was.

1813
02:07:13,290 --> 02:07:15,070
Like, how short is short lived?

1814
02:07:15,150 --> 02:07:15,550
Oh, hey!

1815
02:07:15,990 --> 02:07:16,650
Can I read in the middle?

1816
02:07:16,670 --> 02:07:17,870
Oh, I can't read in the middle of a fight.

1817
02:07:19,790 --> 02:07:21,350
I don't know what to do.

1818
02:07:22,830 --> 02:07:24,170
He doesn't protect his legs.

1819
02:07:24,770 --> 02:07:26,570
I mean, that works too, I guess.

1820
02:07:29,750 --> 02:07:30,690
That's stupid!

1821
02:07:31,690 --> 02:07:33,570
Always have to block your feet.

1822
02:07:38,690 --> 02:07:41,570
Yeah, all right time to read again.

1823
02:07:44,090 --> 02:07:48,570
It's a denouncement from my people placed during my wedding.

1824
02:07:49,790 --> 02:07:50,710
Oh, that's sad.

1825
02:07:51,090 --> 02:07:51,830
Oh, traitor.

1826
02:07:52,130 --> 02:07:53,670
Oh, that's so sad.

1827
02:07:54,930 --> 02:07:58,230
It's like, I can't believe you made out of your out of your
kind.

1828
02:08:00,230 --> 02:08:01,550
How could you portray your kind?

1829
02:08:16,040 --> 02:08:19,280
I'm playing some sick-ass music, though.

1830
02:08:22,300 --> 02:08:23,920
What the fuck did I hit?

1831
02:08:24,400 --> 02:08:26,080
That was not what I hit.

1832
02:08:27,980 --> 02:08:31,800
I'm pretty sure I threw my axe to the right.

1833
02:08:32,460 --> 02:08:33,660
Wait, he's regenning.

1834
02:08:34,580 --> 02:08:35,740
Wait, who's healing him?

1835
02:08:36,840 --> 02:08:38,440
Where's the healer?

1836
02:08:40,580 --> 02:08:41,140
Oh, you!

1837
02:08:41,740 --> 02:08:43,300
You little goblin!

1838
02:08:43,720 --> 02:08:45,260
Think I didn't see you?

1839
02:08:46,220 --> 02:08:47,280
Alright, there you go.

1840
02:08:47,940 --> 02:08:48,400
That's right.

1841
02:08:49,480 --> 02:08:50,640
No mage now.

1842
02:08:51,980 --> 02:08:53,400
I killed your white mage.

1843
02:08:59,030 --> 02:08:59,490
Bam!

1844
02:09:02,720 --> 02:09:04,060
There you go.

1845
02:09:04,800 --> 02:09:05,260
Easy.

1846
02:09:06,980 --> 02:09:07,900
That's right.

1847
02:09:10,780 --> 02:09:13,280
Right, what do you do when I bone rush your healer?

1848
02:09:13,700 --> 02:09:15,900
That's how I feel when I play support.

1849
02:09:16,040 --> 02:09:16,720
Man, anything?

1850
02:09:17,280 --> 02:09:18,300
Healer down.

1851
02:09:22,180 --> 02:09:22,780
Alright.

1852
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:23,780
Oh, what's this?

1853
02:09:25,360 --> 02:09:26,760
That's cute as a chalice.

1854
02:09:27,640 --> 02:09:28,340
From the ceremony.

1855
02:09:28,960 --> 02:09:30,280
Oh, from the wedding ceremony.

1856
02:09:31,980 --> 02:09:33,640
I don't die meta.

1857
02:09:34,240 --> 02:09:36,260
I taught her die meta.

1858
02:09:36,580 --> 02:09:39,920
We drank from the lover's chalice until we could hardly
stand.

1859
02:09:41,060 --> 02:09:41,480
Damn.

1860
02:09:42,540 --> 02:09:45,240
in him that night about wanting an apology from Freyr.

1861
02:09:46,320 --> 02:09:46,720
That's cute.

1862
02:09:47,060 --> 02:09:49,980
Odin reassured me that he'd be the only family I'd need.

1863
02:09:51,380 --> 02:09:52,740
Oh, that's very manipulative.

1864
02:09:53,720 --> 02:09:57,540
Isolate her from her family and be like, I'm the only one
you need, girl.

1865
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:03,400
You don't need no family and friends when I can be your best
friend forever.

1866
02:10:04,200 --> 02:10:06,000
That's actually so manipulative.

1867
02:10:06,420 --> 02:10:09,940
Oh, Odin just gives me the ick right now.

1868
02:10:17,260 --> 02:10:19,980
The word is complete, but I still can't read it from here.

1869
02:10:20,860 --> 02:10:21,580
That's what end.

1870
02:10:24,560 --> 02:10:25,960
Yeah, he's pretty scummy.

1871
02:10:27,680 --> 02:10:30,120
Is there not, like, a little shortcut?

1872
02:10:33,540 --> 02:10:34,360
Oh, my God.

1873
02:10:34,440 --> 02:10:36,760
They go all the way back here.

1874
02:10:37,580 --> 02:10:38,540
The pain only grows.

1875
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,020
Yeah, he has a lot of red flags.

1876
02:10:43,640 --> 02:10:45,300
What more do I need to do?

1877
02:10:49,290 --> 02:10:53,750
I don't think I'm starting to feel like Odin might be a very
bad husband guys.

1878
02:10:53,890 --> 02:11:00,090
I'm not sure yet though I need more I need more data to
fully confirm that or maybe he should he could be just

1879
02:11:00,090 --> 02:11:01,150
misunderstood guys

1880
02:11:07,090 --> 02:11:15,630
I'm still not fully sure yet if he's a really bad guy or
like you know maybe he's just a bad boyfriend

1881
02:11:24,770 --> 02:11:25,650
All right.

1882
02:11:25,710 --> 02:11:26,290
Are you ready?

1883
02:11:26,630 --> 02:11:27,130
I'm ready.

1884
02:11:33,730 --> 02:11:35,790
Or just very misunderstood.

1885
02:11:36,290 --> 02:11:36,610
Exactly.

1886
02:11:38,390 --> 02:11:40,150
My final tie to Asgard.

1887
02:11:40,730 --> 02:11:41,430
What is that?

1888
02:11:42,010 --> 02:11:44,430
We drove that sword into the pillar together.

1889
02:11:49,200 --> 02:11:51,240
The sword was forged for the ceremony.

1890
02:11:53,300 --> 02:11:55,840
The symbol of our union.

1891
02:12:04,040 --> 02:12:05,440
That's a really nice sword.

1892
02:12:18,780 --> 02:12:19,500
Mona.

1893
02:12:25,420 --> 02:12:27,240
She need help?

1894
02:12:28,780 --> 02:12:31,320
Because she doesn't want to let go.

1895
02:12:32,700 --> 02:12:34,140
She hasn't moved on yet.

1896
02:12:40,110 --> 02:12:40,830
Mona!

1897
02:12:47,640 --> 02:12:50,560
What the fuck is you still into that guy for?

1898
02:12:51,200 --> 02:12:51,480
Bro.

1899
02:12:54,900 --> 02:12:56,940
What's keeping you attached to it?

1900
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:08,400
him the deepest wounds form the strongest bonds oh he she
trauma bonded with him oh bastard said it is part of our

1901
02:13:08,400 --> 02:13:11,640
vows i hate it when he's right

1902
02:13:17,260 --> 02:13:31,960
the heart was what the heart was part of me i can't sever i
bond to my son to the valkyries oh That damn realm isn't

1903
02:13:31,960 --> 02:13:33,080
just Odin's.

1904
02:13:33,660 --> 02:13:36,020
She had happy memories there, too.

1905
02:13:36,100 --> 02:13:37,360
That belongs to me too.

1906
02:13:43,470 --> 02:13:49,010
She's stuck with Odin, like how League players are stuck
with that shit, Mova.

1907
02:13:51,430 --> 02:13:53,070
You can never leave.

1908
02:13:57,670 --> 02:13:59,930
The pain he caused is his.

1909
02:14:03,730 --> 02:14:21,820
for for league this sword no longer holds our legacy it
holds her future but it will serve as mine a much more

1910
02:14:21,820 --> 02:14:23,150
fitting use for it

1911
02:14:42,020 --> 02:14:50,060
wait so what changed that let her new sword unlock
customized freya's loadout oh new sword so what changed to

1912
02:14:50,060 --> 02:14:56,220
let her be able to pull the sword out Okay, not gonna lie,
her old sword looks a lot better.

1913
02:14:57,020 --> 02:14:59,780
Like, I guess, like, this has...

1914
02:14:59,780 --> 02:15:04,440
This has freeze now, but I think her old sword looks, like,
nicer.

1915
02:15:08,110 --> 02:15:08,630
Acceptance?

1916
02:15:08,810 --> 02:15:09,570
So she accept...

1917
02:15:09,570 --> 02:15:09,850
Oh.

1918
02:15:10,510 --> 02:15:12,310
She got over her son.

1919
02:15:16,020 --> 02:15:16,920
Oh, I see.

1920
02:15:17,960 --> 02:15:20,440
So she just accepted, she accepted, like, what...

1921
02:15:20,440 --> 02:15:24,440
What happened, and she's, like, just moving on type deal.

1922
02:15:25,220 --> 02:15:25,740
Okay.

1923
02:15:27,130 --> 02:15:35,150
she changed what the sword meant to her oh okay all right
what do we want to use okay the steel heart this is what we

1924
02:15:35,150 --> 02:15:44,790
had before control a deadly poison gas that seeks disrupt in
oh yeah no that sense stun end by frost yeah fuck that that

1925
02:15:44,790 --> 02:15:48,470
shit sound that shit sounds strong all right armor

1926
02:15:52,360 --> 02:15:55,360
no that that blue is just too much

1927
02:16:00,820 --> 02:16:03,700
She has ties to Asgard, but is a tie to her son in Valkyrie?

1928
02:16:05,340 --> 02:16:05,820
That makes sense.

1929
02:16:05,820 --> 02:16:07,680
Yeah, that's what I thought, too.

1930
02:16:07,780 --> 02:16:09,420
I was like, she moved on.

1931
02:16:09,440 --> 02:16:11,680
She had happy memories of Asgard.

1932
02:16:12,280 --> 02:16:13,780
Not just, like, with Odin.

1933
02:16:15,220 --> 02:16:17,160
There's, like, happy moments in her life.

1934
02:16:18,180 --> 02:16:20,680
That wasn't just being controlled by Odin.

1935
02:16:21,820 --> 02:16:22,180
Alright.

1936
02:16:22,620 --> 02:16:24,480
Yeah, that color is not working.

1937
02:16:24,580 --> 02:16:25,580
That's not your color.

1938
02:16:25,880 --> 02:16:26,800
You shouldn't...

1939
02:16:26,800 --> 02:16:28,660
I don't think blue works for you.

1940
02:16:29,020 --> 02:16:29,660
Oh, my God.

1941
02:16:29,700 --> 02:16:31,860
We're finally gonna Request the story.

1942
02:16:32,060 --> 02:16:33,100
We've done it.

1943
02:16:33,500 --> 02:16:34,880
We did it, guys.

1944
02:16:35,620 --> 02:16:37,440
Yeah, I know there was like one word.

1945
02:16:38,640 --> 02:16:39,000
Oh, yeah.

1946
02:16:39,260 --> 02:16:39,880
Oh, shit.

1947
02:16:40,560 --> 02:16:41,220
What the?

1948
02:16:41,380 --> 02:16:42,120
What the fuck?

1949
02:16:42,280 --> 02:16:43,640
Where did he come from?

1950
02:16:43,980 --> 02:16:44,780
What the fuck?

1951
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:47,300
Bro, what the fuck?

1952
02:16:49,380 --> 02:16:51,620
Where did that wolf come from?

1953
02:16:52,340 --> 02:16:54,880
It was like a fucking car crash.

1954
02:16:58,260 --> 02:17:00,220
I actually did not expect that.

1955
02:17:04,340 --> 02:17:06,780
Oh my god, I don't know what the fuck to do.

1956
02:17:07,280 --> 02:17:08,820
God's literally behind me.

1957
02:17:11,860 --> 02:17:12,720
Oh, hey, Derek.

1958
02:17:15,800 --> 02:17:16,740

02:20:31,520 --> 02:20:33,140
That was not it.

2007
02:20:36,020 --> 02:20:39,740
Actual, actual fucking jump scare.

2008
02:20:43,720 --> 02:20:44,740
Are you fucking getting it?

02:20:44,820 --> 02:20:45,020
Really?

2010
02:20:52,810 --> 02:20:54,510
Oh my god, I did watch it though.

2011
02:20:54,770 --> 02:20:55,610
I saw it.

2012
02:20:55,630 --> 02:20:56,530
I just...

2013
02:21:00,140 --> 02:21:01,560
Look, he said watch it.

2014
02:21:02,040 --> 02:21:03,920
He didn't explain what else to do.

2015
02:21:04,400 --> 02:21:06,200
I was just...

2016
02:21:06,200 --> 02:21:07,880
All I do was watch!

2017
02:21:10,540 --> 02:21:12,200
Oh my god, I should have been it.

2018
02:21:15,020 --> 02:21:15,640
There you go.

2019
02:21:16,300 --> 02:21:19,180
There is like no cooldown for that, which I noticed.

2020
02:21:22,720 --> 02:21:23,660
But where's the other guy?

2021
02:21:23,740 --> 02:21:24,060
Oh, there he is.

2022
02:21:24,080 --> 02:21:25,140

2023
02:21:25,420 --> 02:21:30,620
There you go.

2024
02:21:30,980 --> 02:21:31,740
Oh, you saw that!

2025
02:21:32,020 --> 02:21:32,300
That's

2026
02:21:35,590 --> 02:21:36,350
like...

2027
02:21:36,350 --> 02:21:37,010
Oh shit.

2028
02:21:37,630 --> 02:21:38,350
Range time!

2029
02:21:38,870 --> 02:21:39,250
Boom!

2030
02:21:42,390 --> 02:21:43,190
Smash!

2031
02:21:45,610 --> 02:21:47,190
I'm so angry!

2032
02:21:48,470 --> 02:21:49,470
That's like, oh shit!

2033
02:21:49,730 --> 02:21:50,110
Range time!

2034
02:21:50,810 --> 02:21:51,490
Boom!

2035
02:21:53,550 --> 02:21:53,730
Smash!

2036
02:21:53,730 --> 02:21:54,130
I'm so angry!

2037
02:21:54,130 --> 02:21:56,750
That's like, get your ass out of here, fucking jump scare
motherfucker.

2038
02:21:57,390 --> 02:21:58,070
That's right.

2039
02:21:58,190 --> 02:21:59,570
You think you can jump scare me?

2040
02:21:59,830 --> 02:22:00,850
That's fucking right now.

2041
02:22:01,050 --> 02:22:01,950
Look at who's dead.

2042
02:22:03,170 --> 02:22:05,210
I killed your fucking wife too.

2043
02:22:07,090 --> 02:22:08,830
How do you see your wife in hell?

2044
02:22:10,130 --> 02:22:11,290
Too much for that boat.

2045
02:22:11,570 --> 02:22:12,370
All right, nice.

2046
02:22:12,750 --> 02:22:13,630
We did it.

2047
02:22:14,250 --> 02:22:15,370
We did it.

2048
02:22:16,470 --> 02:22:17,090
Oh my god.

2049
02:22:17,250 --> 02:22:18,110
My boat!

2050
02:22:18,870 --> 02:22:20,470
How would I get home?

2051
02:22:21,270 --> 02:22:22,690
Oh, I got another boat.

2052
02:22:22,890 --> 02:22:23,710
Okay, never mind.

2053
02:22:24,190 --> 02:22:25,150
I have two boats.

2054
02:22:28,650 --> 02:22:29,690
I know.

2055
02:22:30,610 --> 02:22:33,250
An arrogant man once told me you can't change the past.

2056
02:22:33,550 --> 02:22:34,750
Thank god I have two boats.

2057
02:22:36,210 --> 02:22:37,550
I think he might be right.

2058
02:22:39,170 --> 02:22:41,350
It's been a while since I've had a confidence.

2059
02:22:42,850 --> 02:22:46,450
Would the god of few words lend me his ear now and again?

2060
02:22:47,110 --> 02:22:48,590
As long as I am needed.

2061
02:22:50,850 --> 02:22:52,090
Alright, off we go.

2062
02:22:53,510 --> 02:22:54,410
We did it.

2063
02:22:55,290 --> 02:22:56,750
We can go home now.

2064
02:22:57,370 --> 02:23:00,450

Thank you.

2080
02:26:42,520 --> 02:26:44,780
What are we talking about in particular?

2081
02:26:45,340 --> 02:26:46,560
Giving up your body.

2082
02:26:47,260 --> 02:26:50,000
Do I regret exchanging my life for my freedom?

2083
02:26:50,860 --> 02:26:52,920
That's a question I ask myself every day.

2084
02:26:53,080 --> 02:26:53,620
Oh, is it broken?

2085
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:54,960
Why is it broken?

2086
02:26:55,380 --> 02:26:55,960
I'm chat.

2087
02:26:56,540 --> 02:26:57,820
Glad to be out in the world.

2088
02:26:58,060 --> 02:26:58,780
Oh, yeah, it is.

2089
02:27:00,120 --> 02:27:01,780
Why is it broken?

2090
02:27:02,380 --> 02:27:03,040
Let me try.

2091
02:27:04,780 --> 02:27:05,600
Is it still broken?

2092
02:27:06,040 --> 02:27:06,400
Let me see.

2093
02:27:06,580 --> 02:27:07,120
Nope, it's not.

2094
02:27:07,200 --> 02:27:08,080
That's so weird.

2095
02:27:08,880 --> 02:27:10,600
I don't know why it's broken, lady.

2096
02:27:12,540 --> 02:27:12,580
Um.

2097
02:27:16,500 --> 02:27:18,160
Alright, it's the right one.

2098
02:27:20,480 --> 02:27:21,560
But it's fixed now.

2099
02:27:22,420 --> 02:27:23,300
It's fixed now.

2100
02:27:24,180 --> 02:27:24,760
That's weird.

2101
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:27,120
Okay, okay.

2102
02:27:29,180 --> 02:27:29,680
Strange.

2103
02:27:29,820 --> 02:27:30,300
It is.

2104
02:27:31,180 --> 02:27:32,780
I have no idea why it's like that.

2105
02:27:34,580 --> 02:27:35,840
Oh, I tried to figure this out.

2106
02:27:36,340 --> 02:27:37,160
Let's see.

2107
02:27:41,860 --> 02:27:42,460
Oh, it's good.

2108
02:27:43,760 --> 02:27:44,560
It's shiny.

2109
02:27:48,620 --> 02:27:49,460
This crest.

2110
02:27:50,200 --> 02:27:50,560
Ooh.

2111
02:27:50,820 --> 02:27:51,680
It's mine.

2112
02:27:52,660 --> 02:27:53,280
It's yours?

2113
02:27:53,820 --> 02:27:54,560
What is it?

2114
02:27:55,340 --> 02:27:56,780
That Lunda's armor?

2115
02:27:57,340 --> 02:27:58,100
Engine over.

2116
02:27:58,200 --> 02:27:59,700
I can fix it up right quick.

2117
02:28:00,840 --> 02:28:02,520
Would have been ashamed to have left that behind.

2118
02:28:06,130 --> 02:28:07,130
Let's do it.

2119
02:28:07,350 --> 02:28:09,850
What other new armor can I make now?

2120
02:28:10,590 --> 02:28:11,050
Can I make this?

2121
02:28:11,170 --> 02:28:11,770
Oh, I am!

2122
02:28:15,500 --> 02:28:17,260
Wait, is Lunas armor the strongest?

2123
02:28:17,800 --> 02:28:18,320
Or what?

2124
02:28:18,760 --> 02:28:19,440
Very good.

2125
02:28:20,640 --> 02:28:23,080
I have enough.

2126
02:28:23,740 --> 02:28:24,660
Asgardian Inget?

2127
02:28:25,040 --> 02:28:25,800
Oh, I already have that.

2128
02:28:27,580 --> 02:28:28,000
Alright.

2129
02:28:29,280 --> 02:28:31,880
Is that the strongest armor in the game?

2130
02:28:34,520 --> 02:28:36,080
Sure, I'm open.

2131
02:28:38,260 --> 02:28:39,080
Let's see.

2132
02:28:39,100 --> 02:28:41,260
Now for the goddess.

2133
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:42,940
Nope, just me.

2134
02:28:45,940 --> 02:28:46,000
No?

2135
02:28:46,360 --> 02:28:46,780
I am.

2136
02:28:46,940 --> 02:28:48,080
It was not the strongest.

2137
02:28:48,240 --> 02:28:50,280
That music can be even stronger.

2138
02:28:52,980 --> 02:28:54,400
I will keep all of that.

2139
02:28:56,300 --> 02:28:57,260
Special items?

2140
02:28:57,360 --> 02:28:58,760
Is there anything I want to miss?

2141
02:29:00,360 --> 02:29:00,740
Nah.

2142
02:29:01,140 --> 02:29:01,920
Everything's fine.

2143
02:29:03,100 --> 02:29:04,800
Oh yeah, I'm only halfway in this.

2144
02:29:05,740 --> 02:29:06,960
It's only halfway.

2145
02:29:08,520 --> 02:29:13,120
We're gonna It only took two hours, but we're finally done
with the side quest.

2146
02:29:13,400 --> 02:29:14,720
Oh my fucking god.

2147
02:29:14,840 --> 02:29:15,040
What?

2148
02:29:23,310 --> 02:29:23,530
What?

2149
02:29:23,890 --> 02:29:24,890
What is this?

2150
02:29:25,790 --> 02:29:27,030
The Elven Sanctum?

2151
02:29:27,450 --> 02:29:28,670
The Eyes of Odin?

2152
02:29:29,130 --> 02:29:29,890
Oh, fuck that.

2153
02:29:29,970 --> 02:29:31,510
I'm fucking progressing the game.

2154
02:29:35,150 --> 02:29:38,170
It only took two hours.

2155
02:29:42,560 --> 02:29:46,280
Before you see the lad again, might we discuss an approach?

2156
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:56,600
where he has been that is my approach ah classic spartan
diplomacy wait what did you say odin invited him to asgard

2157
02:29:56,600 --> 02:30:04,380
and then he disappeared for two days wait that's pretty
that's pretty suspicious don't underestimate odin's powers

2158
02:30:04,380 --> 02:30:14,160
of persuasion come on i'm only halfway why wouldn't he do
the same with yours he doesn't discriminate yeah but i just

2159
02:30:14,160 --> 02:30:19,520
want to spend time with my new wife If we lose Artaeus, it's
fine.

2160
02:30:20,860 --> 02:30:23,080
You can always make a new one.

2161
02:30:25,320 --> 02:30:26,400
Well, look either.

2162
02:30:27,020 --> 02:30:29,640
Glad you could make the trip, your goddessness.

2163
02:30:30,360 --> 02:30:33,700
I put your sigil magic on the young turd's bow.

2164
02:30:34,360 --> 02:30:37,600
But then he and Sindri got into it over something.

2165
02:30:38,320 --> 02:30:41,100
I don't rightly know who's yelling at who in there.

2166
02:30:41,460 --> 02:30:43,320
But I figure they both got it coming.

2167
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:47,860
Here we go.

2168
02:30:48,900 --> 02:30:49,400
Hello.

2169
02:30:50,700 --> 02:30:52,420
What is his purpose anyway?

2170
02:30:54,280 --> 02:30:56,060
This whole spectral squirrel business.

2171
02:30:56,600 --> 02:30:58,980
You can shoot out your feelings into little ghosties.

2172
02:30:59,500 --> 02:31:03,020
I suppose that is a slightly in elegant way of putting it.

2173
02:31:03,640 --> 02:31:09,840
These spectral versions of myself are aspects of my
personality that I often find distracting at best.

2174
02:31:10,400 --> 02:31:16,660
My ability not only lets me cast them away and provide some
temporary peace of mind, it also allows me to see what goes

2175
02:31:16,660 --> 02:31:16,980
on.

2176
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:25,180
outside the tree why not school with yourself as the eternal
caretaker of the tree i may not leave its confines all part

2177
02:31:25,180 --> 02:31:32,180
of the deal but worth it for the immortality and such my
spectral form still allow me to see the outside world albeit

2178
02:31:32,180 --> 02:31:39,740
through slightly colorful viewpoints that's one word for it
that better form of yours is a nasty piece of work i'm

2179
02:31:39,740 --> 02:31:48,440
standing right here you know i'd apologize for him but where
would it end Please come back anytime.

2180
02:31:49,420 --> 02:31:53,240
Oh, he's just, he's just like a little lore drop thing.

2181
02:31:53,980 --> 02:31:57,420
Just be like, you want to know more lore about God of War.

2182
02:31:57,800 --> 02:31:58,880
Talks to squirrels now, huh?

2183
02:31:59,680 --> 02:32:00,880
He talks back!

2184
02:32:01,420 --> 02:32:02,620
How is that weird?

2185
02:32:03,100 --> 02:32:04,580
He's a talking squirrel.

2186
02:32:04,800 --> 02:32:06,820
Of course I'll fucking talk to him.

2187
02:32:07,580 --> 02:32:08,580
Spartan, thank you for this.

2188
02:32:08,740 --> 02:32:10,020
Spartan, thank you for the super chat.

2189
02:32:10,140 --> 02:32:10,880
Thank you, thank you.

2190
02:32:12,040 --> 02:32:14,000
Hey, Jokey, thanks for playing God of War today.

2191
02:32:14,080 --> 02:32:16,740
I love watching the chaos of this game after having a long
day.

2192
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:18,180
Your shenanigans make me laugh.

2193
02:32:18,220 --> 02:32:18,540
Thank you.

2194
02:32:18,560 --> 02:32:19,260
They give a super chat.

2195
02:32:19,400 --> 02:32:19,480
Thank you.

2196
02:32:19,500 --> 02:32:19,960
Thank you.

2197
02:32:20,060 --> 02:32:22,080
You see I got waiting for you, right?

2198
02:32:22,500 --> 02:32:27,040
Um, I'm please You're not the center of my world.

2199
02:32:27,420 --> 02:32:27,420
Okay.

2200
02:32:27,620 --> 02:32:31,500
I have a chat Here's where I wonder why I was eating.

2201
02:32:31,860 --> 02:32:39,840
I had one more box of lunchables And so I was like fuck
yeah, I might as well finish it I'm literally a child right

2202
02:32:39,840 --> 02:32:40,080
now.

2203
02:32:40,100 --> 02:32:48,760

You got company!

2206

It's lunchtime.

2207
02:32:53,120 --> 02:32:54,260
I gotta eat my lunchable.

2208
02:32:57,460 --> 02:32:59,480

2209

Mind?

2210
02:33:01,440 --> 02:33:02,700
He'll be thrilled.

2211
02:33:03,380 --> 02:33:05,800
Joints getting classier by the dick.

2212
02:33:07,440 --> 02:33:09,120
It's not a lunchly!

2213
02:33:09,460 --> 02:33:10,480
It's a lunchable!

2214
02:33:10,660 --> 02:33:12,540
I never thought I'd have the pleasure of seeing you again,
Frick.

2215
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:15,340
Don't call me that.

2216
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:25,780
that person in a long time but i'm happy to see you too i'd
feared the worst for so long what you must have been through

inspiration for those of us who believe in peace the only

being a complete asshole.

2229
02:35:26,980 --> 02:35:27,420
That is true.

2230
02:35:27,540 --> 02:35:30,840
You can't just say, why don't you trust me when he won't
even, like, tell me anything.

2231
02:35:31,200 --> 02:35:32,240
It's fine if he keeps secrets.

2232
02:35:32,480 --> 02:35:33,300
It's fine if mom did.

2233
02:35:33,640 --> 02:35:34,540
That is not fine.

2234
02:35:35,380 --> 02:35:37,040
No secrets are hard to be set with this path.

2235
02:35:38,180 --> 02:35:38,700
Oh, okay.

2236
02:35:39,140 --> 02:35:40,480
Do I sound like I'm fine?

2237
02:35:40,520 --> 02:35:41,680
This is not about your mother.

2238
02:35:42,880 --> 02:35:44,660
What you have done is lie.

2239
02:35:45,360 --> 02:35:46,520
Wonder where I learned that.

2240
02:35:46,720 --> 02:35:47,860
That's quite enough.

2241
02:35:48,160 --> 02:35:48,420
Damn.

2242
02:35:48,420 --> 02:35:50,080
Since when do you always take his side?

2243
02:35:50,160 --> 02:35:51,880
Since he became the one making sense.

2244
02:35:53,520 --> 02:35:53,920
Look.

2245
02:35:54,640 --> 02:35:58,840
I was only thinking about going to Odin, but I swear it's
for a good reason.

2246
02:35:59,340 --> 02:36:01,360
There is no good reason to go to...

2247
02:36:01,360 --> 02:36:03,400
How dare you even think about it, boy?

2248
02:36:04,320 --> 02:36:05,360
How dare you?

2249
02:36:06,380 --> 02:36:08,500
I gotta stop something bad from happening.

2250
02:36:08,820 --> 02:36:09,940
Something bad did happen.

2251
02:36:10,540 --> 02:36:11,520
Look at me!

2252
02:36:11,520 --> 02:36:15,240
I don't have a body!

2253
02:36:15,520 --> 02:36:18,440
Well, it's got everyone catar-walling all of a sudden.

2254
02:36:18,700 --> 02:36:20,120
Atreus wants to go to Asgard.

2255
02:36:20,740 --> 02:36:21,260
Asgard?

2256
02:36:21,740 --> 02:36:23,560
Get kicked in the head or something?

2257
02:36:24,420 --> 02:36:24,700
Great.

2258
02:36:25,160 --> 02:36:26,440
I guess everybody's against me now.

2259
02:36:26,840 --> 02:36:28,940
You must choose who you're going to be.

2260
02:36:31,040 --> 02:36:33,700
Are you going to continue to lie and keep things from me?

2261
02:36:34,440 --> 02:36:35,520
Are you my son?

2262
02:36:37,360 --> 02:36:37,680
Choose?

2263
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:40,700
I never get to choose.

2264
02:36:41,820 --> 02:36:42,620
Just leave me alone.

2265
02:36:42,860 --> 02:36:43,240
Oh.

2266
02:36:43,320 --> 02:36:44,020
Let go of me.

2267
02:36:44,700 --> 02:36:45,240
Let's go.

2268
02:36:45,420 --> 02:36:46,580
Oh, Shindo!

2269
02:36:47,480 --> 02:36:48,120
Oh, fuck.

2270
02:36:48,320 --> 02:36:48,900
I trashed.

2271
02:36:49,620 --> 02:36:50,080
It's Sindri.

2272
02:36:50,640 --> 02:36:53,380
Just let the furry overtake himself.

2273
02:36:54,700 --> 02:36:55,260
Oh!

2274
02:37:06,910 --> 02:37:08,030
Oh no.

2275
02:37:09,510 --> 02:37:12,270
The moment you leave this house, you're not allowed back
here.

2276
02:37:21,740 --> 02:37:23,360
That's very... his ward rage.

2277
02:37:33,800 --> 02:37:36,360
Oh shit, I have to play as a Tears now?

2278
02:37:37,840 --> 02:37:40,180
Oh shit, now I have to remember I'll play as him!

2279
02:37:40,660 --> 02:37:42,040
I just remember!

2280
02:37:42,680 --> 02:37:43,580
Figuring it out!

2281
02:37:45,920 --> 02:37:46,960
Okay, nice.

2282
02:37:48,020 --> 02:37:48,640
Alright, though.

2283
02:37:48,840 --> 02:37:49,660
Okay, that was sick, though.

2284
02:37:50,600 --> 02:37:51,500
I'm getting better at the parries.

2285
02:37:52,180 --> 02:37:53,460
You're just helping me stay warm.

2286
02:37:55,720 --> 02:37:56,660
Home, shoot home.

2287
02:37:58,560 --> 02:38:05,640
I like playing Arteus, but right now it's not it because I
just figured out how to play with my brawl play with Kratos.

2288
02:38:09,180 --> 02:38:12,240
So I'm like, fuck not the robot play as him!

2289
02:38:16,560 --> 02:38:27,920

He's got a channel.

2294
02:38:53,240 --> 02:38:54,380
Channel his inner furry.

2295
02:38:56,460 --> 02:38:57,420
Oh, those are some crows.

2296
02:38:57,740 --> 02:38:58,610
He doesn't want to kill me.

2297
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:02,420
Let the furry out.

2298
02:39:03,100 --> 02:39:03,500
Solid.

2299
02:39:03,620 --> 02:39:03,820
Thank you.

2300
02:39:03,940 --> 02:39:04,480

Damn.

02:39:11,660 --> 02:39:12,180
Holy shit.

2306
02:39:12,300 --> 02:39:12,620
I'm so angry.

2307
02:39:12,640 --> 02:39:13,060
I'm angry.

2308
02:39:13,280 --> 02:39:14,800
I can figure out where to go next.

2309
02:39:17,240 --> 02:39:19,760
Uh, that doesn't look good.

2310
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:21,100
What the fuck is that?

2311
02:39:21,220 --> 02:39:22,060
Is that a ghost?

2312
02:39:24,580 --> 02:39:25,540
Oh, nice.

2313
02:39:26,440 --> 02:39:27,480
What is this thing?

2314
02:39:27,840 --> 02:39:28,760
Some kind of white?

2315
02:39:32,040 --> 02:39:32,320
Nice.

2316
02:39:33,120 --> 02:39:35,360
I mean, I can still hit it.

2317
02:39:35,940 --> 02:39:37,100
Not a very good ghost.

2318
02:39:39,260 --> 02:39:40,080
Oh, fuck.

2319
02:39:40,980 --> 02:39:42,620

02:40:22,350 --> 02:40:22,970
More ravens.

2326
02:40:23,290 --> 02:40:24,470
It's a pretty bad ghost.

2327
02:40:24,650 --> 02:40:25,530
You trying to tell me something?

2328
02:40:25,850 --> 02:40:27,230
If I can just shoot it.

2329
02:40:28,730 --> 02:40:29,350
This way.

2330
02:40:30,110 --> 02:40:33,690
Back to Ameritians, before you run away, why didn't you
bring a compass with you?

2331
02:40:33,990 --> 02:40:34,290
Blind.

2332
02:40:35,510 --> 02:40:35,750
Ah!

2333
02:40:40,930 --> 02:40:43,430
I'm trying to save your life, you big jerk.

2334
02:40:46,350 --> 02:40:46,930
There you go.

2335
02:40:47,470 --> 02:40:48,470
Gotta get out of the cold.

2336
02:40:49,910 --> 02:40:53,450
Yeah, I forgot to bring a jacket with me before I ran away.

2337
02:40:56,250 --> 02:40:57,330
Is this way?

2338
02:40:57,650 --> 02:40:58,990
Oh, or is it this way?

2339
02:40:59,250 --> 02:41:02,270
Well, I guess I'll never know which way is the right way.

2340
02:41:02,870 --> 02:41:03,150
All right.

2341
02:41:04,050 --> 02:41:07,250
I can kill him.

2342
02:41:08,550 --> 02:41:08,670
Boop.

2343
02:41:09,490 --> 02:41:10,010
Boop.

2344
02:41:10,370 --> 02:41:10,450
Boop.

2345
02:41:10,990 --> 02:41:11,130
Boop.

2346
02:41:11,570 --> 02:41:11,730
Boop.

2347
02:41:13,610 --> 02:41:14,070
Boop.

2348
02:41:16,170 --> 02:41:16,690
Yeah.

2349
02:41:16,950 --> 02:41:17,230
Yeah.

2350
02:41:17,710 --> 02:41:18,030
Yeah.

2351
02:41:18,550 --> 02:41:18,950
Yeah.

2352
02:41:18,950 --> 02:41:19,310
Yeah.

2353
02:41:19,950 --> 02:41:29,030

2355
02:41:38,990 --> 02:41:49,030
close personal space uh forget if anyone mentioned this
before but all the yellow paint markers in both games are

2356
02:41:49,030 --> 02:41:57,110
implied to be set by fate on every step of their path her
yellow paint persists even now oh that's cool so it's like

2357
02:41:57,110 --> 02:42:09,650
she knew that her husband and her son are gonna be
incompetent it's not like a true mom she knew she was like

2358
02:42:09,650 --> 02:42:16,590
when I died there's no way they're gonna know what the fuck
there's no way they'll know what to do and that she was

2359
02:42:16,590 --> 02:42:19,890
right she She was a real mom.

2360
02:42:24,290 --> 02:42:26,910
She's like, before I die, I gotta make sure.

2361
02:42:28,810 --> 02:42:30,790
A real mom moment.

2362
02:42:32,210 --> 02:42:34,370
Oh my god, he knows how to dodge.

2363
02:42:38,350 --> 02:42:38,690
Yeah.

2364
02:42:39,970 --> 02:42:41,650
I find shelter and then what?

2365
02:42:42,110 --> 02:42:42,830
Where could I go?

2366
02:42:46,400 --> 02:42:51,180
She knew, she was like, there's no way they could get
anything done without my help.

2367
02:42:52,260 --> 02:43:01,400
Following the prophecy where father ends up dead if I stay
locked up at home There's nothing I can do to stop it That's

2368
02:43:01,400 --> 02:43:11,620
right as guard I you're the main character Arteus you spy
Find out his plan Get control of this No,

2369
02:43:18,110 --> 02:43:20,030
that's the opposite of what Kratos wanted.

2370
02:43:20,310 --> 02:43:24,810
He was like I gotta stop him from talking to Odin And now
he's like you know what?

2371
02:43:25,890 --> 02:43:29,990
I am gonna talk to Odin just because you didn't want me to.

2372
02:43:30,250 --> 02:43:31,190
I can't go to Asgard.

2373
02:43:34,150 --> 02:43:35,890
It's like the...

2374
02:43:36,830 --> 02:43:37,830
What is it called?

2375
02:43:38,290 --> 02:43:40,950

doing it?

You could have led me around those.

2450
02:52:36,710 --> 02:52:40,270
Even if he led me away from them, it won't stop me.

2451
02:52:40,670 --> 02:52:41,810
I'm hungry for blood!

2452
02:52:42,590 --> 02:52:43,350

2453
02:52:43,990 --> 02:52:46,350
He's going through puberty right now!

2454
02:52:47,070 --> 02:52:48,730
Alright, let's get him out though.

02:53:18,520 --> 02:53:19,060
Oh, my God.

2463
02:53:19,320 --> 02:53:20,480
For God, I can swap arrows.

2464
02:53:21,120 --> 02:53:22,220
I don't even remember what.

2465
02:53:23,860 --> 02:53:25,560
I was like, oh, my God, wait.

2466
02:53:26,720 --> 02:53:27,820
Oh, my God.

2467
02:53:27,960 --> 02:53:29,700
I have different arrows, guys.

2468
02:53:30,380 --> 02:53:32,340
I actually legitimately don't remember what my...

2469
02:53:34,800 --> 02:53:35,320
I don't remember.

2470
02:53:36,700 --> 02:53:38,920
I don't remember what the other arrow does.

2471
02:53:39,300 --> 02:53:40,120
You guys remember?

2472
02:53:40,980 --> 02:53:41,740
Because I don't.

2473
02:53:42,420 --> 02:53:47,680
What is this?

2474
02:53:47,960 --> 02:53:48,900
What is this arrow?

2475
02:53:54,030 --> 02:53:56,590
What does that arrow even do again?

2476
02:53:58,630 --> 02:53:59,910
It hits people.

2477
02:54:00,090 --> 02:54:00,830
Thank you guys.

2478
02:54:01,490 --> 02:54:02,610
It's purple.

2479
02:54:04,550 --> 02:54:07,390
Well, this might be the craziest thing I've ever done.

Odin hi I I came to be your apprentice, I guess.

02:54:43,770 --> 02:54:46,430
But it doesn't mean I like serve you now.

2484
02:54:47,210 --> 02:54:49,430
Not in a foretold by prophecy kind of way.

2485
02:54:51,430 --> 02:54:56,990
I'm gonna send that out.

2486
02:54:58,290 --> 02:55:00,130

2487
02:55:01,910 --> 02:55:03,870

02:55:58,210 --> 02:55:59,470
Then fight back.

2495
02:55:59,690 --> 02:56:00,830
How do I get past the wall?

2496
02:56:01,850 --> 02:56:03,670
I never came up with a mere story about Ruther.

2497
02:56:04,310 --> 02:56:05,270
Oh, he didn't listen.

2498
02:56:05,450 --> 02:56:06,750
Oh, he wasn't there.

2499
02:56:07,510 --> 02:56:08,910
He only told Frey about it.

2500
02:56:09,510 --> 02:56:10,510
And I didn't think to ask.

2501
02:56:11,030 --> 02:56:11,890
God damn it.

2502
02:56:11,950 --> 02:56:12,650
He doesn't know.

2503
02:56:12,790 --> 02:56:13,310
He's a way at the house.

2504
02:56:14,170 --> 02:56:15,130
Did she move in with us?

2505
02:56:15,830 --> 02:56:17,050
Is she my new mom?

2506
02:56:17,590 --> 02:56:18,310
Focus, Loki.

02:56:22,490 --> 02:56:23,370
Oh yeah, he didn't.

2510
02:56:23,530 --> 02:56:24,650
He was like, what the fuck?

2511
02:56:24,750 --> 02:56:25,470
Wait a minute.

2512
02:56:26,410 --> 02:56:27,630
Why is she here?

2513
02:56:30,290 --> 02:56:31,150
It's like, wait a minute.

2514
02:56:31,270 --> 02:56:32,030
Do I have a new mom now?

2515
02:56:33,310 --> 02:56:34,050

2516
02:56:34,270 --> 02:56:36,150
I don't remember how to do this.

2517
02:56:39,490 --> 02:56:40,890
Like, how do I burn this?

2518
02:56:41,890 --> 02:56:43,150

Yeah, it's the Netflix stream of the guy that was climbing
the fucking tower.

2594
03:03:08,060 --> 03:03:09,860
He's gonna send that over to Netflix.

2595
03:03:10,040 --> 03:03:11,440
I'm gonna get $500,000.

2597
03:03:14,980 --> 03:03:16,500
Okay, not gonna lie.

2598
03:03:17,460 --> 03:03:18,280
Jesus Christ.

2599
03:03:18,700 --> 03:03:23,640
The fact that he has airtime when he's jumping is actually
insane.

2600
03:03:27,440 --> 03:03:29,060
I'm getting my Netflix money.

2601
03:03:30,620 --> 03:03:31,300
See that?

2602
03:03:31,580 --> 03:03:34,360
That's why I'm Odin's apprentice and you ain't.

2603
03:03:35,700 --> 03:03:37,020
Can you still see me from here?

2604

03:03:40,800 --> 03:03:41,900
He's like, where did he go?

2606

03:04:43,030 --> 03:04:44,170

2626
03:05:55,960 --> 03:05:57,280
It sure seemed like Odin could.

2627
03:05:58,080 --> 03:05:59,860
That was you and our cabin, right?

2628
03:06:00,520 --> 03:06:02,980
You and your brother, I guess?

2629
03:06:04,640 --> 03:06:08,120
Taking that- Yeah, floating ghost died from fall damage.

2630
03:06:08,700 --> 03:06:12,080
His- a ghost's one weakness, fall damage.

2631
03:06:12,080 --> 03:06:12,820
He's like, no!

2632
03:06:13,720 --> 03:06:15,960
I don't know where the floor is.

2633
03:06:16,040 --> 03:06:17,580
I guess I died now.

2634
03:06:17,980 --> 03:06:19,400
I bet I'm past the worst of it now.

2635
03:06:23,960 --> 03:06:27,160

03:06:56,100 --> 03:06:57,060
So sweet.

2640
03:06:59,480 --> 03:07:00,840
Oh my god, there's more?

2641
03:07:01,620 --> 03:07:03,900
I swear to God, I just want this.

2642
03:07:04,260 --> 03:07:06,980
Is there some... Okay, there's a fucking thing over there.

2643
03:07:08,000 --> 03:07:08,940
Yeah, there is.

2644
03:07:10,860 --> 03:07:12,640
Like, where are they all coming from?

2645
03:07:13,540 --> 03:07:14,800
Oh, there it is.

2646
03:07:20,100 --> 03:07:21,020
There we go.

2647
03:07:21,920 --> 03:07:22,780
Oh, there's more.

2648
03:07:26,960 --> 03:07:27,480
Oh?

2649
03:07:29,500 --> 03:07:31,100
Is there another one over there?

2650
03:07:31,620 --> 03:07:32,140
Yeah, there is.

2651
03:07:32,240 --> 03:07:32,850
There has to be.

2652
03:07:36,820 --> 03:07:37,100
Oh.

2653
03:07:37,960 --> 03:07:39,220
Oh, I'm running out.

2654
03:07:45,210 --> 03:07:46,410
Alright, I gotta get up there.

2655
03:07:49,030 --> 03:07:49,610
There we go.

2656
03:07:50,610 --> 03:07:52,210
Alright, now back downstairs.

2657
03:07:52,770 --> 03:07:53,690
Gotta grab my loot.

2658
03:08:01,030 --> 03:08:02,690
That's when we know we're all equal.

2659
03:08:03,390 --> 03:08:10,530
No matter what, whether you're a ghost, a demon, or a devil,
or a skeleton, or a monster, we all die from fall damage.

2660
03:08:11,190 --> 03:08:13,370
No one ever escapes from fall damage.

2661
03:08:24,980 --> 03:08:26,760
All right, nice.

2662
03:08:28,340 --> 03:08:29,060
Gravity rules.

2663
03:08:29,600 --> 03:08:31,840
No one can escape from gravity.

2664
03:08:36,560 --> 03:08:37,080
Whoa.

2665
03:08:44,040 --> 03:08:44,560
Okay.

2666
03:08:45,940 --> 03:08:48,060
I mean, can I go from here?

2667
03:08:50,160 --> 03:08:51,440
Looks a little like Soundstone.

2668
03:08:52,740 --> 03:08:54,560
How come I can't do anything to it, though?

2669
03:08:56,700 --> 03:08:57,460
Oh, there's stuff here.

2670
03:08:57,680 --> 03:08:57,940
Nice.

2671
03:08:58,660 --> 03:08:58,960
Oh!

2672
03:09:05,120 --> 03:09:05,640
Huh?

2673
03:09:12,090 --> 03:09:13,190
Can't do anything.

2674
03:09:14,910 --> 03:09:26,590
buying both claps to free the counterweight I did I thought
there's the claps here and then the claps over there oh R2

2675
03:09:26,590 --> 03:09:39,190
whoops my bad yeah that's my bad thing gotta do both sides
though all right no I just didn't realize it's R2 I can't I

2676
03:09:39,190 --> 03:09:46,770
can't do it with R1 there you go this might work That makes
sense.

2677
03:09:47,070 --> 03:09:48,410
Here we go.

2678
03:09:50,130 --> 03:09:50,730
Whoa!

2679
03:09:51,230 --> 03:09:51,470
Shit!

2680
03:09:53,110 --> 03:09:56,090
Apparently I was not on the same page of what the plan was.

2681
03:09:56,850 --> 03:10:00,210
I was like, yeah, I definitely know the plan.

2682
03:10:02,670 --> 03:10:04,230
What the fuck?

2683
03:10:08,130 --> 03:10:09,190
Alright, nice.

2684
03:10:12,330 --> 03:10:12,950

why don't why doesn't Odin just send all this crows over and

2687
03:10:34,750 --> 03:10:43,770
then have all the crows just pick me up just got to climb a
little further maybe a lot further i'm pretty sure if all

2688
03:10:43,770 --> 03:10:57,210
the crows like pick me up like i can make it this way hey
hugen how about i tell you a story once there was a giant

2689
03:10:57,210 --> 03:11:01,970
named loki who thought it'd be a good idea to accept odin's
invitation to asgard

2690
03:11:05,010 --> 03:11:10,990
so odin tested loki expecting him to climb by himself all
the way

2691
03:11:17,090 --> 03:11:31,510
I'm okay oh my god this actually is like the Netflix special
no equipment it was a thousand meters it's all right just

2692
03:11:31,510 --> 03:11:39,750
keep climbing just keep climbing how hard to breathe Loki
kept climbing one okay maybe I should stop telling the story

2693
03:11:39,750 --> 03:11:41,490
while I'm trying to Loki.

2694
03:11:42,650 --> 03:11:43,930
Loki may be time and place.

2695
03:11:44,450 --> 03:11:44,990
Time and place.

2696
03:11:48,770 --> 03:11:50,750
Gotta get that 500k.

2697
03:11:50,790 --> 03:11:51,750
Nowhere to go, but up.

2698
03:11:55,950 --> 03:11:56,390
Keep going.

2699
03:11:57,690 --> 03:11:57,970
Come on.

2700
03:11:58,630 --> 03:11:59,550
Can't stop now.

2701
03:12:01,810 --> 03:12:03,170
We're almost there.

2702
03:12:03,310 --> 03:12:06,510
I know I said that like 10 minutes ago, but this time...

2703
03:12:06,510 --> 03:12:07,370
Oh my gosh.

2704
03:12:08,930 --> 03:12:11,170
We're definitely almost there now.

2705
03:12:14,190 --> 03:12:17,010
Jesus Christ, that is a big ass jump.

2706
03:12:19,950 --> 03:12:21,230
I can do this.

2707
03:12:21,970 --> 03:12:22,630
I can do this.

2708
03:12:22,770 --> 03:12:24,630
How did my mom paint all this?

2709
03:12:26,650 --> 03:12:27,210
Bro.

2710
03:12:31,270 --> 03:12:33,730

So, what?

2717
03:12:47,800 --> 03:12:51,340

I was sent for, actually.

2722
03:13:03,220 --> 03:13:03,760
By Odin?

2723
03:13:05,320 --> 03:13:06,780
No, it's a bouncer.

2724
03:13:07,920 --> 03:13:09,320

They're just watching this all.

2736
03:14:00,920 --> 03:14:01,740
That's fuck.

2737
03:14:03,360 --> 03:14:04,900
Think you could pull me up or...

2738
03:14:05,480 --> 03:14:06,960
No, I don't think I will.

2739
03:14:08,240 --> 03:14:09,380
I think maybe I'll do it.

2740
03:14:09,400 --> 03:14:17,260
drop you no wait that's not cool goodbye wait wait wait wait
wait come mad the all-father's gonna be when when he finds

the yotner the enemy of my people I am not your enemy I'm

2742
03:14:34,700 --> 03:14:36,180
even the worst thing to say

2743
03:14:43,160 --> 03:14:45,620
I will be the judge of that

2744
03:14:50,870 --> 03:14:51,470
Huh?

2745
03:14:53,490 --> 03:14:54,310
What is he gonna do?

2746
03:14:55,810 --> 03:15:03,430
Also, now the fucking crows Okay, now the crows Don't show
up Is this Heimdall?

2747
03:15:03,870 --> 03:15:05,090
This is Heimdall?

2748
03:15:09,100 --> 03:15:19,280
Now feel free to drink in the splendor of Asgard He is the
bouncer It's the actual Bouncer of Asgard I knew it steal

2749
03:15:19,280 --> 03:15:23,060
anything that is not nailed down that is sure to impress
your hosts

2750
03:15:30,250 --> 03:15:42,030
yeah oh i'm gonna hate him oh i mean just no one really no
one really likes bouncers to be fair it is my job next

2751
03:15:42,030 --> 03:15:50,370
question what is your job i protect the realm i love from
trouble and you think i'm trouble you just met me and i can

2752
03:15:50,370 --> 03:15:59,030
already see you are eager to prove yourself way too eager
probably due to an overshadowing father figure you can never

2753
03:15:59,030 --> 03:16:10,810
live up to oh damn yes i would also guess that you are and
see through my soul entitled and impulsive you don't know me

2754
03:16:10,810 --> 03:16:25,600
i was like you don't look like yourself oh you are here to
help people hmm no no you are here to help yourself to

2755
03:16:25,600 --> 03:16:32,620
manipulate and lie to whoever you have to to get what you
want not true I know you're young your voice probably

2756
03:16:32,620 --> 03:16:44,700
dropped while you were climbing the wall but what a twisted
little soul you have you are chaos in a spiffy Is he

2757
03:16:44,700 --> 03:16:46,220
psycho-analyzing me?

2758
03:16:48,500 --> 03:16:51,540
Nothing good is going to come from you being in Asgard.

2759
03:16:59,130 --> 03:17:01,810
The first year psychology student right there.

2760
03:17:02,150 --> 03:17:07,030
It takes Psych 101 once and now thinks he can psychoanalyze
everyone.

2761
03:17:08,170 --> 03:17:10,070
I guess that makes us allies.

2762
03:17:12,710 --> 03:17:13,790
Ghoul Topper.

2763
03:17:14,790 --> 03:17:15,830
Who loves me the most?

2764
03:17:17,030 --> 03:17:29,190
loves me the most wow whoa that's almost as impressive as
boulder taming a dragon boulder had the luxury of not caring

2765
03:17:29,190 --> 03:17:40,960
how badly he got burnt i i would think them dominate them
fair and square oh wait i gotta be on on the back

2766
03:17:46,130 --> 03:17:54,170
that's a big ass cat oh are these all asia gods what you
think all asia are gods?

2767
03:17:54,950 --> 03:17:57,810
But Skilder told me that only... Oh, well, Skilder told you.

2768
03:17:58,350 --> 03:18:04,350
Clearly whoever that is must be the authority on Asir gods,
not the Asir god you are currently talking to.

2769
03:18:05,130 --> 03:18:07,990
You literally know nothing of our culture, do you?

2770
03:18:08,230 --> 03:18:09,370
I know lots of things.

2771
03:18:09,830 --> 03:18:11,070
I know a giant built that wall.

2772
03:18:11,570 --> 03:18:12,130
A giant.

2773
03:18:12,430 --> 03:18:15,190
Built the wall that keeps out the giants.

2774
03:18:15,650 --> 03:18:17,330
Krimther, son of Thamur.

2775
03:18:17,750 --> 03:18:18,910
I know the whole story.

2776
03:18:23,630 --> 03:18:27,730
decaled me with the revisionist tales of Asgard's
architectural history.

2777
03:18:30,330 --> 03:18:33,050
That's what they say, only winners write history.

2778
03:18:33,110 --> 03:18:33,790
Is that only palace?

2779
03:18:34,370 --> 03:18:34,890
Palace.

2780
03:18:35,610 --> 03:18:40,570
Do you think the Allfather needs to puff himself up like
some mortal chieftain?

2781
03:18:41,190 --> 03:18:42,390
I guess not.

2782
03:18:42,750 --> 03:18:47,170
That is the great lodge, which the Allfather built with his
own hands.

2783
03:18:47,210 --> 03:18:49,090
Call me a revisionist.

2784
03:18:49,170 --> 03:18:50,910
I'm sorry if that is a letdown for you.

2785
03:18:53,630 --> 03:19:10,170
you see does not need to flaunt it emerges when the time is
right don't you agree oh whoa he's such an asshole i love

2788
03:19:26,190 --> 03:19:26,910
What happened?

2789
03:19:28,550 --> 03:19:29,550
That's right.

2790
03:19:29,890 --> 03:19:30,890
What if you know?

2791
03:19:33,170 --> 03:19:35,350
It could be wrong, you know?

2792
03:19:37,690 --> 03:19:38,410
Oh, shit.

2793
03:19:43,170 --> 03:19:43,610
Damn!

2794
03:19:47,090 --> 03:19:47,810
Shit!

2795
03:19:49,670 --> 03:19:51,910
I mean, I literally...

2796
03:19:51,910 --> 03:19:53,610
That was... I literally bit his head.

2797
03:19:53,630 --> 03:20:04,370

pay you were counting on that to protect you oh he's just

2799
03:20:19,530 --> 03:20:25,070
walking menacely towards me guys You're gonna stop me from
seeing Odin.

2800
03:20:25,650 --> 03:20:27,630
He always try to grab me.

2801
03:20:28,410 --> 03:20:28,930
What?

2802
03:20:29,090 --> 03:20:30,610
That doesn't even make sense.

2803
03:20:32,470 --> 03:20:35,940
What I do is try to very slowly grab me.

2804
03:20:37,330 --> 03:20:38,550
Glad to see you are awake.

2805
03:20:39,710 --> 03:20:39,850
What?

2806
03:20:40,590 --> 03:20:41,290
Oh.

2807
03:20:41,750 --> 03:20:42,370
What he deserves.

2808
03:20:43,110 --> 03:20:44,310
Is that it?

2809
03:20:45,290 --> 03:20:47,770
Is this all you have to show me?

2810
03:20:47,770 --> 03:20:48,510
He's acting!

2811
03:20:49,610 --> 03:20:51,450
Oh, that one fell.

2812
03:20:51,690 --> 03:20:52,950
He has...

2813
03:20:53,850 --> 03:20:54,730
Speedax!

2814
03:20:55,450 --> 03:20:55,890
Sure!

2815
03:20:57,290 --> 03:20:57,850
Completely ineffective!

2816
03:20:58,270 --> 03:20:58,950
Oh shit!

2817
03:20:59,730 --> 03:21:01,390
Wait, he actually grabbed me!

2818
03:21:02,090 --> 03:21:04,330
I'm kidding, Orobar.

2819
03:21:06,110 --> 03:21:07,710
He said cheating.

2820
03:21:08,790 --> 03:21:09,410
Unimpressed.

2821
03:21:11,390 --> 03:21:12,790
You should probably stay down.

2822
03:21:15,010 --> 03:21:15,310
Oh!

2823
03:21:15,890 --> 03:21:17,110
Odin's coming.

2824
03:21:17,990 --> 03:21:19,490
I love the eye effects.

2825
03:21:21,470 --> 03:21:23,370
That's like Heimdell's power, right?

2826
03:21:23,630 --> 03:21:38,430
foretell foresee everything that i feel like he's literally
a like a psychic yeah i thought i smelled something he can

how this ends really and how do you intend to stop me look

2828
03:21:50,630 --> 03:21:56,160

2829
03:22:01,470 --> 03:22:18,030
i's trying to posture him really it's like you made it i am
so honored i i see you've met heimdall he reads minds for me

2830
03:22:18,030 --> 03:22:32,630
the boy is false all father this young man who is my guest
is covered in mud care to explain he means to betray you huh

2831
03:22:32,630 --> 03:22:42,930
is that true Loki you a little trickster he can oh of course
he means to betray me huh Heimdall why else would he come

2832
03:22:42,930 --> 03:22:51,270
I've given him no reason to trust me not yet but he's got
some very big questions and I have So many answers to get.

2833
03:22:54,130 --> 03:22:54,790
What are you up to?

2834
03:22:55,130 --> 03:22:55,730
Loki, a trickster?

2835
03:22:55,870 --> 03:22:56,150
No way.

2836
03:22:57,090 --> 03:22:57,610
Oh, wait.

2837
03:22:57,810 --> 03:22:59,770
The app, like, he still has the scar.

2838
03:23:00,130 --> 03:23:01,450
And you clean yourself up.

2839
03:23:03,150 --> 03:23:07,210
Wasn't there a theory about how Loki was able to trick
Heimdell?

2840
03:23:09,390 --> 03:23:10,710
Heimdell, will you just relax?

2841
03:23:10,770 --> 03:23:12,690
I remember when the game first came out.

2842
03:23:13,030 --> 03:23:13,710
You were kidding me first thing?

2843
03:23:15,150 --> 03:23:15,530
See?

2844
03:23:17,070 --> 03:23:17,510
What?

2845
03:23:17,570 --> 03:23:18,630
That's not good enough for you?

2846
03:23:19,830 --> 03:23:21,470
get out of here

2847
03:23:28,400 --> 03:23:39,900
he's a lot i know very perceptive but sometimes he just
forgets to think you know hey i got some places to be oh

2848
03:23:39,900 --> 03:23:50,400
yeah why couldn't he just do that instead of me climbing the
fucking wall savage welcome to tomato farm welcome i know he

2849
03:23:50,400 --> 03:23:53,020
sounds like he's on it from new yorker Boston.

2850
03:23:53,820 --> 03:23:55,880
He literally sounds like a mob boss.

2851
03:23:56,820 --> 03:23:59,620
That was a test.

2852
03:24:00,120 --> 03:24:05,440
Between my ex-wife and my disgruntled former employee, he's
not exactly getting an unbiased view.

2853
03:24:06,180 --> 03:24:08,080
But you, you're curious.

2854
03:24:08,640 --> 03:24:09,020
Open-minded.

2855
03:24:09,920 --> 03:24:10,400
That's important.

2856
03:24:13,220 --> 03:24:14,600
I'm walking here.

2857
03:24:15,620 --> 03:24:19,800
Oh, they're prepping for a war.

2858
03:24:20,540 --> 03:24:21,580
The Ragnarok.

2859
03:24:22,460 --> 03:24:30,520
after you went to front here but i suppose spending time
with him is punishment enough isn't it at least my mirror

2860
03:24:30,520 --> 03:24:40,180
never lost his sense of humor but yeah that's all behind us
now i like to keep looking forward hey hey hey i want them

2861
03:24:40,180 --> 03:24:47,620
trained not decapitated just keep it below the neck all
right is that really what you do when i'm not here oh father

2862
03:24:47,620 --> 03:24:53,180
queen gana the ain't her yard are ready for your blessings
that's why i'm here isn't it Hmm.

2863
03:24:54,220 --> 03:24:55,720
I guess there's a new Valkyrie queen.

2864
03:24:56,120 --> 03:24:57,980
Great soldiers, these ain't here we are.

2865
03:24:58,480 --> 03:25:01,200
But they tend to come out of Valhalla a little foggy.

2866
03:25:01,920 --> 03:25:03,260
I do what I can for them, help them.

2867
03:25:03,920 --> 03:25:05,460
Remember who they were in life.

2868
03:25:06,080 --> 03:25:07,760
That's important, don't you think?

2869
03:25:08,320 --> 03:25:09,600
A sense of identity.

2870
03:25:10,420 --> 03:25:12,140
Gives things meaning.

2871
03:25:13,260 --> 03:25:16,200
Moon, Thin, Nafen, Rothgar.

2872
03:25:16,460 --> 03:25:16,780
Oh.

2873
03:25:17,420 --> 03:25:20,220
Moon, Thin, Thin, Thorn.

2874
03:25:21,780 --> 03:25:22,440
Moon, Thin, Thorn.

2875
03:25:22,460 --> 03:25:27,720
Give him special powers.

2876
03:25:28,080 --> 03:25:28,580
Oh, shit.

2877
03:25:30,860 --> 03:25:32,040
He's roiding them up.

2878
03:25:35,740 --> 03:25:36,400
Brainwashing.

2879
03:25:37,760 --> 03:25:40,660
Oh, he brainwashed those guys.

2880
03:25:40,780 --> 03:25:41,300
Wait, what?

2881
03:25:41,660 --> 03:25:43,060
What do you mean by brainwashing?

2882
03:25:46,770 --> 03:25:48,450
The magic steroids.

2883
03:25:49,050 --> 03:25:49,310
Yeah.

2884
03:25:50,570 --> 03:25:51,470
Ah, the box.

father there's a situation that needs your attention Oh,
father.

2898
03:27:25,090 --> 03:27:26,230
I'm not your father.

2899
03:27:26,770 --> 03:27:27,470
Oh, it's Sif!

2900
03:27:28,270 --> 03:27:29,510
Say hello to Loki.

2901
03:27:31,790 --> 03:27:32,450
This is him.

2902
03:27:33,590 --> 03:27:33,990
Here.

2903
03:27:34,830 --> 03:27:36,110
In our home.

2904
03:27:38,010 --> 03:27:38,630
How nice.

2905
03:27:39,250 --> 03:27:39,890
That's right.

2906
03:27:41,110 --> 03:27:42,830
Everything all right in New Midgard.

2907
03:27:46,410 --> 03:27:47,550
The refugees are fine.

2908
03:27:48,230 --> 03:27:49,950
The situation is with the dwarves.

2909
03:27:50,690 --> 03:27:52,290
Okay, but they were pretty bad.

2910
03:27:52,530 --> 03:27:56,770
There she's just let you You let the boy who killed my son
into our home?

2911
03:27:57,030 --> 03:27:57,950
Okay, that's cool.

2912
03:27:58,510 --> 03:27:59,110
I guess.

2913
03:28:01,150 --> 03:28:02,270
That's okay.

2914
03:28:03,290 --> 03:28:05,170
She was so icy towards me.

2915
03:28:05,630 --> 03:28:07,610
I started worried she knew what I did.

2916
03:28:07,770 --> 03:28:09,990
Yeah, I wonder if she knows.

2917
03:28:22,520 --> 03:28:23,340
All right.

2918
03:28:23,920 --> 03:28:24,520
I'm here.

2919
03:28:25,180 --> 03:28:26,040
Oh, there's the dwarves.

2920
03:28:26,240 --> 03:28:27,900
Oh, just over there.

2921
03:28:28,200 --> 03:28:28,380
Oh, father.

2922
03:28:28,800 --> 03:28:31,500
Oh, we're back here.

2923
03:28:31,540 --> 03:28:32,680
We're back in dwarf land.

2924
03:28:36,280 --> 03:28:38,160
Oh, it's a tax guy!

2925
03:28:38,240 --> 03:28:39,380
It's been too long.

2926
03:28:39,860 --> 03:28:40,820
What's the issue now?

2927
03:28:41,180 --> 03:28:42,780
Give him the ultimate punishment.

2928
03:28:43,420 --> 03:28:44,780
Becoming a bureaucrat.

2929
03:28:44,900 --> 03:28:50,140
I approve these designs personally and not all that
recently, I might add.

2930
03:28:50,740 --> 03:28:53,320
Did you just wake up with the urge to be a pain in my ass?

2931
03:28:53,740 --> 03:28:53,980
Yeah.

2932
03:28:55,160 --> 03:28:55,920
Who's the good?

2933
03:28:56,320 --> 03:28:57,540
You're training pokeball kids.

03:28:57,900 --> 03:28:58,300
You know what?

2935
03:28:58,480 --> 03:28:59,440

2936
03:29:00,540 --> 03:29:01,040
Good acting.

2937
03:29:01,760 --> 03:29:03,980

answers, meet me in my study.

2943
03:29:50,860 --> 03:29:51,960
Oh, you see, he's in tent.

2944
03:29:52,260 --> 03:29:52,480
Okay.

2945
03:29:54,720 --> 03:29:55,960
Wait, what did Odin just said?

2946
03:29:56,300 --> 03:29:58,660
Oh, and help yourself do a change of clothes.

2947
03:30:01,560 --> 03:30:03,360
Alright, let's change clothes.

2948
03:30:04,640 --> 03:30:05,900
What did Odin just say?

2949
03:30:11,470 --> 03:30:13,330
I'm recrafted by the smiths.

2950
03:30:14,750 --> 03:30:16,050
I guess I could try this on.

2951
03:30:16,250 --> 03:30:16,810
I'll try it on.

2952
03:30:19,470 --> 03:30:21,170
Oh, and a new bow.

2953
03:30:21,930 --> 03:30:22,470
Oh, my God.

2954
03:30:22,710 --> 03:30:24,970
My new dad is so nice to me.

2955
03:30:27,170 --> 03:30:29,670
Wait, what's so bad about Odin?

2956
03:30:30,170 --> 03:30:30,510
Anyway.

2957
03:30:32,910 --> 03:30:34,930
This seems so bad.

2958
03:30:37,190 --> 03:30:38,990
Really increased stun from me.

2959
03:30:39,630 --> 03:30:41,210
Oh, I like the stun, though.

2960
03:30:41,290 --> 03:30:43,870
I think stun is better than cooldown.

2961
03:30:44,230 --> 03:30:46,370
Really increased stun from...

2962
03:30:48,210 --> 03:30:49,770
He's so nice, guys.

2963
03:30:50,070 --> 03:30:51,850
Look, he got me free stuff.

2964
03:30:54,590 --> 03:30:56,530
My new dad is so nice to me.

2965
03:30:56,770 --> 03:31:01,130
When was the last time my father gave me free stuff?

2966
03:31:03,850 --> 03:31:04,410
True.

2967
03:31:05,610 --> 03:31:07,490
Is that new PlayStation 5?

2968
03:31:08,470 --> 03:31:10,390
Wait, a PlayStation 6?

2969
03:31:11,250 --> 03:31:13,230
It was not even in the market yet.

2970
03:31:14,470 --> 03:31:15,730
Which is better, chat?

2971
03:31:15,950 --> 03:31:17,530
Acer bow or Talon bow?

2972
03:31:23,370 --> 03:31:24,630
Which one's better?

2973
03:31:26,490 --> 03:31:28,290
I will craft it, but I want to know.

2974
03:31:35,570 --> 03:31:36,090
Yes?

2975
03:31:37,190 --> 03:31:38,110
This one?

2976
03:31:39,610 --> 03:31:40,850
Upgrade it, then.

2977
03:31:43,490 --> 03:31:44,810
I'll try it out.

2978
03:31:47,210 --> 03:31:48,250
With the...

2979
03:31:48,250 --> 03:31:49,930
With the cooldown.

2980
03:31:50,490 --> 03:31:52,310
I like the sun, just because, like...

2981
03:31:52,310 --> 03:31:55,350
I feel like the sun would work better for me, but I'll try
it out.

2982
03:31:55,370 --> 03:32:04,350
see how i feel upgrade increases the damage dealt from this
effect

2983
03:32:09,400 --> 03:32:16,420
i'll craft it just to see how i feel how many can i be
equipped anyway

2984
03:32:23,620 --> 03:32:25,140
increases status

2985
03:32:31,760 --> 03:32:35,460
oh no oh

2986
03:32:40,090 --> 03:32:40,750
fuck it

2987
03:32:45,370 --> 03:32:47,270
All right, what is my uniform?

2988
03:32:48,030 --> 03:32:49,910
My new armor.

2989
03:32:51,470 --> 03:32:51,990
Where is it?

2990
03:32:52,210 --> 03:32:53,190
A-tier uniform.

2991
03:32:55,570 --> 03:32:55,730
Whoa!

2992
03:32:56,530 --> 03:32:56,930
Wait!

2993
03:32:57,410 --> 03:32:59,970
Look at the fucking quality of that!

2994
03:33:00,930 --> 03:33:05,330
Oh my god, the only way I can get stabbed is through my
armpit or my arm.

2995
03:33:07,530 --> 03:33:07,990
Wait.

2996
03:33:09,970 --> 03:33:12,070
Wait, I think I have a new dad.

2997
03:33:13,690 --> 03:33:15,270
Wait a minute, guys.

2998
03:33:15,290 --> 03:33:18,410
I think I have a new dad.

2999
03:33:26,220 --> 03:33:28,580
It was just that easy.

3000
03:33:28,780 --> 03:33:30,460
Just buy me a 50-90.

3001
03:33:34,120 --> 03:33:35,880
And dad 2.0.

3002
03:33:36,600 --> 03:33:39,080
Yeah, Kratos never gave me a shiny armor.

3003
03:33:39,400 --> 03:33:39,960
Look at this.

3004
03:33:40,060 --> 03:33:40,740
Oh my god.

3005
03:33:40,760 --> 03:33:42,440
Look at the shot on that.

3006
03:33:42,820 --> 03:33:45,120
That is good craftsmanship right here.

3007
03:33:48,750 --> 03:33:50,870
Yeah, he would just give me a life lesson.

3008
03:33:51,550 --> 03:33:51,850
Whoa.

3009
03:33:51,950 --> 03:33:52,450
Whoa.

3010
03:33:52,450 --> 03:33:53,070
Loki, right?

3011
03:33:54,190 --> 03:34:11,890
the irony of this isn't lost on me oh it's that sister oh i
knew it moody ah your brother really i had no idea uh-huh

3012
03:34:13,550 --> 03:34:24,290
all right come on your brother was an ass though enjoy what
for a thirst doctor is that it relax you got some pretty

3013
03:34:24,290 --> 03:34:25,430
small shoes to fill.

3014
03:34:30,570 --> 03:34:32,710
she didn't like his brother, right?

3015
03:34:34,670 --> 03:34:35,670
Like, got him.

3016
03:34:36,470 --> 03:34:37,810
We're better off without him, okay?

3017
03:34:39,130 --> 03:34:41,530
Aw, it was a deadbeat.

3018
03:34:41,810 --> 03:34:42,050
Trust me.

3019
03:34:43,470 --> 03:34:46,090
It looked like she did more work than him, to be fair.

3020
03:34:47,010 --> 03:34:50,350
It looked like she was like the more confident sibling.

3021
03:34:52,110 --> 03:34:53,370
It's a walk with me.

3022
03:34:53,390 --> 03:34:54,070
Oh, my God.

3023
03:34:54,470 --> 03:34:54,790
I'm sorry.

3024
03:34:54,910 --> 03:35:03,010
Whenever I hear that line, just sounds very serious very
cliche you know like what it's like the exposition dump walk

3025
03:35:03,010 --> 03:35:06,490

crazy honestly you're right there has been a lot of walking

3027
03:35:22,160 --> 03:35:24,460
what kind of sword is that It's new.

3028
03:35:25,200 --> 03:35:25,760
One of a kind.

3029
03:35:26,380 --> 03:35:28,100
My father gave it to me for Valkyrie training.

3030
03:35:28,500 --> 03:35:29,520
You're in Valkyrie training?

3031
03:35:29,780 --> 03:35:30,720
Got time to talk about it?

3032
03:35:31,160 --> 03:35:32,360
I was just heading to the Great Hall.

3033
03:35:33,120 --> 03:35:36,320
But if you need to go to work, grandfather's study is just
down those stairs.

3034
03:35:40,120 --> 03:35:40,760
Oh, no, no.

3035
03:35:40,940 --> 03:35:41,800
We can walk.

3036
03:35:42,440 --> 03:35:43,460
You said walk with me.

3037
03:35:43,520 --> 03:35:44,700
I'm ready to walk.

3038
03:35:44,820 --> 03:35:45,480
Let's go.

3039
03:35:47,680 --> 03:35:48,900
So how do you become a Valkyrie?

3040
03:35:49,320 --> 03:35:51,100
First I train till I'm the best I can be.

3041
03:35:51,180 --> 03:35:52,000
My new girlfriend.

3042
03:35:53,100 --> 03:35:55,780
And then I hope he and my dad can convince mom it's okay.

3043
03:35:55,840 --> 03:36:02,160
You know, my father and I, we encountered a whole bunch of
Valkyries.

3044
03:36:02,740 --> 03:36:02,740
What?

3045
03:36:03,100 --> 03:36:03,340

You understand who this is, right?

3056
03:36:16,900 --> 03:36:18,260

03:39:12,810 --> 03:39:15,910
You see, this is you not letting me talk.

3091
03:39:16,970 --> 03:39:20,250
No, Hugin, I don't need my ears cleaned.

3092
03:39:21,330 --> 03:39:28,570
I need you to stop croaking and and accept the answer you
know I'm about to give.

3093
03:39:31,370 --> 03:39:32,050
Oh?

3094
03:39:33,570 --> 03:39:34,390
Kind of magic.

3095
03:39:34,690 --> 03:39:36,710
Why is this sword tied to the wall?

3096
03:39:37,550 --> 03:39:38,030
Looking at this.

3097
03:39:39,090 --> 03:39:39,790
That old thing.

3098
03:39:40,770 --> 03:39:41,730
I've had that since.

3099
03:39:42,670 --> 03:39:42,790
Huh.

3100
03:39:43,870 --> 03:39:44,570
Who can remember?

3101
03:39:49,070 --> 03:39:49,750
Whoa.

3102
03:39:51,890 --> 03:39:52,110
Whoa.

3103
03:39:52,110 --> 03:39:52,910
You have a name?

3104
03:39:53,410 --> 03:39:53,770
Ingrid.

3105
03:39:54,650 --> 03:39:55,090
Ingrid?

3106
03:39:55,870 --> 03:39:56,610
Sure, why not?

3107
03:39:57,430 --> 03:39:59,250
Sure, why not?

3108
03:40:00,230 --> 03:40:11,350
And dad gave me a new sword consider it a perk of the job
thank you why did oh why did kratos not let me meet him come

3109
03:40:11,350 --> 03:40:27,770
on let's walk oh my god and i get a new sword guys she's
toky it's just that easy you're welcome immediately bought

3110
03:40:27,770 --> 03:40:44,370
because she it's just that easy oh my god new sword best dad
ever oh my god and i found money too it was just lying

3111
03:40:44,370 --> 03:40:53,590
they're not locked up in a chest next see they give us a
super chat they can thank you wait if odin is your new dad

3112
03:40:53,590 --> 03:41:04,210
doesn't that mean she's doing these everyone's got me all
wrong you think war drives me or power Nah, never have.

3113
03:41:04,730 --> 03:41:05,850
You know what drives me?

3114
03:41:06,150 --> 03:41:07,270
What I really want?

3115
03:41:07,750 --> 03:41:09,090
I want answers.

3116
03:41:09,610 --> 03:41:10,230
Same as you.

3117
03:41:10,730 --> 03:41:11,870
See, mortals have it easy.

3118
03:41:12,250 --> 03:41:18,490
When they push up against life's big questions, they can
look to us to give them meaning, divine comfort.

3119
03:41:19,190 --> 03:41:21,350
We both know that's a sham.

3120
03:41:21,730 --> 03:41:29,690
But when we have questions, why are we here to give meaning
to mortals while living without it ourselves?

3121
03:41:30,010 --> 03:41:30,510
No.

3122
03:41:31,310 --> 03:41:32,330
We're more than that.

3123
03:41:32,510 --> 03:41:34,950
and I found something that proves it.

3124
03:41:37,730 --> 03:41:38,730
What's wrong with that?

3125
03:41:39,150 --> 03:41:39,690
What is it?

3126
03:41:39,970 --> 03:41:41,290
Isn't it great to be a guy?

3127
03:41:42,530 --> 03:41:44,110
You feel it, don't you?

3128
03:41:48,570 --> 03:41:49,690
Feels like...

3129
03:41:49,690 --> 03:41:50,130
Knowledge.

3130
03:41:50,950 --> 03:41:51,290
Oh.

3131
03:41:51,650 --> 03:41:52,050
Truth.

3132
03:41:52,690 --> 03:41:53,310
All truth.

3133
03:41:54,170 --> 03:41:55,190
All the answers.

3134
03:41:56,390 --> 03:42:02,490
We could find out why we're here, learn how to change our
fates, stop Ragnarok for good, maybe.

3135
03:42:02,510 --> 03:42:15,630
save the people we love how I was a young God when I found
it touch it spent lifetimes studying it following every clue

3136
03:42:15,630 --> 03:42:28,310
down every dead end looking for finally unearthing this huh
see that she has the same mystical energy it opened a crack

3137
03:42:28,310 --> 03:42:31,550
can we just look I wouldn't recommend that.

3138
03:42:32,310 --> 03:42:32,670
Why not?

3139
03:42:34,810 --> 03:42:35,430
Oh.

3140
03:42:37,410 --> 03:42:38,870
He lost his eye from it.

3141
03:42:38,890 --> 03:42:39,590
What's the broken mask for?

3142
03:42:40,950 --> 03:42:43,550
Recognize any writing on it?

3143
03:42:53,180 --> 03:42:54,640
These aren't from the Nine Realms.

3144
03:43:01,600 --> 03:43:02,860
Obsidione Spica.

3145
03:43:04,800 --> 03:43:12,600
From smoldered earth and obsidian spark and a field of
battles never fought.

3146
03:43:13,540 --> 03:43:14,020
Are you certain?

3147
03:43:15,960 --> 03:43:19,240
He's literally the world's Google Translate.

3148
03:43:21,500 --> 03:43:23,200
Keep working with me.

3149
03:43:23,580 --> 03:43:24,240
He's Deep L.

3150
03:43:25,900 --> 03:43:26,960
You don't have to kill anyone.

3151
03:43:27,400 --> 03:43:30,340
You don't have to betray your father or yourself.

3152
03:43:30,980 --> 03:43:31,460
Come on.

3153
03:43:31,540 --> 03:43:32,940
I know you felt what I felt.

3154
03:43:33,360 --> 03:43:34,460
The answers are in there.

3155
03:43:34,580 --> 03:43:35,540
Let's get them.

3156
03:43:36,300 --> 03:43:38,960
I mean, you translated this language like it was nothing.

3157
03:43:42,040 --> 03:43:45,660
If I do help you, What's next?

3158
03:43:46,660 --> 03:43:46,920
Door!

3159
03:43:47,520 --> 03:43:48,300
Get down here!

3160
03:43:48,420 --> 03:43:49,080
All father.

3161
03:43:49,500 --> 03:43:49,660
Whoa!

3162
03:43:52,120 --> 03:43:53,940
What's next is chasing this down.

3163
03:43:55,240 --> 03:43:55,580
Take this.

3164
03:43:56,700 --> 03:43:58,180
And this stealthy side of beef.

3165
03:43:59,440 --> 03:44:00,500
And see where I've taken you.

3166
03:44:03,240 --> 03:44:04,520
I don't promise anything.

3167
03:44:04,860 --> 03:44:05,220
Nonsense.

3168
03:44:05,820 --> 03:44:06,420
Happy hunting.

3169
03:44:08,480 --> 03:44:08,840
And you.

3170
03:44:10,180 --> 03:44:11,360
Go easy on him.

3171
03:44:11,560 --> 03:44:11,980
You hear me?

3172
03:44:14,000 --> 03:44:16,060
Oh shit, is he my new sidekick?

3173
03:44:16,460 --> 03:44:19,760
Or I swear to God, if he doesn't fucking one-shot people,
I...

3174
03:44:19,760 --> 03:44:20,380
He's...

3175
03:44:20,380 --> 03:44:21,680
He's standbacking here.

3176
03:44:21,740 --> 03:44:23,020
He's definitely holding back.

3177
03:44:23,100 --> 03:44:24,340
There's no fucking way.

3178
03:44:26,900 --> 03:44:28,080
I swear to God.

3179
03:44:28,240 --> 03:44:28,820
Moose behind?

3180
03:44:30,660 --> 03:44:31,880
The rest of the mask is here?

3181
03:44:32,660 --> 03:44:34,340
It's where all father dropped us.

3182
03:44:35,240 --> 03:44:35,900
What do you think?

3183
03:44:36,920 --> 03:44:39,080
Just take that and do your damn job.

3184
03:44:44,810 --> 03:44:46,810
Oh my god, Thor and Loki!

Right here.

3197
03:46:39,310 --> 03:46:39,890
Up there.

3198
03:46:40,590 --> 03:46:42,270
It looks like there might be a ledge we could reach.

3199
03:46:42,850 --> 03:46:43,290
If we...

3200
03:46:43,290 --> 03:46:44,050
Too slow.

3201
03:46:45,590 --> 03:46:45,890
Hey!

3202
03:46:48,790 --> 03:46:51,550
You can't just grab people like that?

3203
03:46:52,030 --> 03:46:53,410
No, what else are they gonna do?

3204
03:46:56,550 --> 03:46:59,270
Oh my god, he's actually helping guys!

3205
03:47:01,050 --> 03:47:02,070
Oh my god!

3206
03:47:05,030 --> 03:47:06,670
Wait, I don't have to do anything.

3207
03:47:06,810 --> 03:47:07,570
Look at him.

3208
03:47:09,350 --> 03:47:11,970
Oh, oh, okay.

3209
03:47:12,910 --> 03:47:13,030
Okay.

3210
03:47:14,270 --> 03:47:14,630
There.

3211
03:47:15,510 --> 03:47:18,510
There's things up there hitting us with fire.

3212
03:47:18,990 --> 03:47:20,270
Use your ball already.

3213
03:47:21,010 --> 03:47:21,410
Woo!

3214
03:47:21,710 --> 03:47:23,550

3219
03:48:05,400 --> 03:48:05,560
Right.

3220
03:48:07,800 --> 03:48:08,800
Um, I didn't do anything.

3221
03:48:08,980 --> 03:48:10,460
It was all my dad's fault.

3222
03:48:10,900 --> 03:48:12,920
I was just a bystander.

3223
03:48:14,640 --> 03:48:15,400

it'll be perfect.

03:48:21,000 --> 03:48:22,760
Bray, thank you for the welcome to tomato farm.

It's our way there.

3234

Is that some kind of anvil?

3235
03:48:42,460 --> 03:48:45,240
I guess we can't get there yet

3236
03:48:48,550 --> 03:48:50,250
Yeah, it's locked.

03:48:50,610 --> 03:48:51,690

03:50:08,940 --> 03:50:09,600
Not yet?

3248
03:50:12,280 --> 03:50:13,680
Oh, is that for later?

3249
03:50:13,920 --> 03:50:14,540
For this one?

3250
03:50:17,200 --> 03:50:18,440
Oh, it's welcome to the Mena farm.

3251
03:50:18,640 --> 03:50:19,320
Welcome, welcome.

3252
03:50:20,900 --> 03:50:22,280
Oh, it's a secret for later.

3253
03:50:29,100 --> 03:50:29,920
Go grab that.

3254
03:50:35,560 --> 03:50:37,680
There's always golds in these pots.

3255
03:50:38,480 --> 03:50:39,920
How do I get over there?

3256
03:50:43,680 --> 03:50:43,800
Door?

3257
03:50:45,940 --> 03:50:46,320
Door?

3258
03:50:46,840 --> 03:50:48,220
We have to go there.

3259
03:50:50,340 --> 03:50:50,740
Door?

3260
03:50:54,840 --> 03:50:55,240
Door?

3261
03:51:00,800 --> 03:51:02,440
Any thought moment.

3262
03:51:07,190 --> 03:51:08,730
Oh, there it is.

3263
03:51:08,870 --> 03:51:09,990
Oh, okay, I see it.

3264
03:51:11,830 --> 03:51:12,970
Oh, he just jumped.

3265
03:51:12,990 --> 03:51:22,910
over you know you could you know help me you could you know
grab me too and take me to the other side but i guess he can

3266
03:51:22,910 --> 03:51:35,450
watch me climb this wall not too bad oh listen moody had
some problems but he was my son and the only reason you

3267
03:51:35,450 --> 03:51:42,490
aren't mush right now is because of that broken piece of
wood look clearly neither of us can do this mission alone

3268
03:51:42,990 --> 03:51:45,910
And I want to impress the Allfather just as much as you do.

3269
03:51:46,650 --> 03:51:47,950
You don't have to like me.

3270
03:51:48,150 --> 03:51:50,550
But we're going to have to trust each other.

3271
03:51:51,450 --> 03:51:52,630
Just a little bit.

3272
03:51:52,670 --> 03:51:53,870
Could be your new son.

3273
03:51:54,050 --> 03:51:54,350
Trust.

3274
03:51:55,310 --> 03:51:57,310
Or, you know, maybe son-in-law, you know?

3275
03:51:57,770 --> 03:51:58,070
Huh?

3276
03:51:58,330 --> 03:51:59,350
You know, you...

3277
03:51:59,350 --> 03:52:02,490
You know, your daughter sort of really likes me.

3278
03:52:02,590 --> 03:52:04,650
And then, you know, I could be your new son-in-law.

3279
03:52:08,710 --> 03:52:09,110
Yeah.

3280
03:52:09,210 --> 03:52:11,010
Don't bother getting up.

3281
03:52:12,070 --> 03:52:12,690
How come?

3282
03:52:12,990 --> 03:52:22,570
All right, go where sword is here That's right with the
power of the sword Oh shit, like what's the point?

3283
03:52:22,670 --> 03:52:25,910
I don't even have to do I get XP for the people he killed?

3284
03:52:28,150 --> 03:52:30,190
You're more than welcome to step it up.

3285
03:52:30,430 --> 03:52:32,350
This is me trusting you

3286
03:52:35,410 --> 03:52:37,230
Boom, that's right.

3287
03:52:37,630 --> 03:52:43,730
I bet Moni core didn't even do that That could be his
replacement system Sun, you know?

3288
03:52:49,430 --> 03:52:50,510
Alright, that's guys.

3289
03:52:50,730 --> 03:52:51,690
It's just this guy left.

3290
03:52:54,310 --> 03:52:55,190
There we go.

3291
03:52:57,690 --> 03:52:58,850
Plus one Sun.

3292
03:53:00,010 --> 03:53:05,270
Okay, I'm pretty sure I'm even a better Sun than Mori if you
think about it.

3293
03:53:07,330 --> 03:53:08,610
It's like this way.

3294
03:53:10,730 --> 03:53:13,610
Alright, it says this way, which means I gotta go this way.

3295
03:53:14,490 --> 03:53:15,550
There might be extra loot.

3296
03:53:19,290 --> 03:53:20,170
Give me a sec.

3297
03:53:20,510 --> 03:53:22,110
I gotta grab some extra loot.

3298
03:53:28,210 --> 03:53:28,510
I don't know.

3299
03:53:28,610 --> 03:53:32,130
I thought there might be bonus items there.

3300
03:53:32,790 --> 03:53:33,790
Could be a chest.

3301
03:53:35,550 --> 03:53:37,610
Wait, I don't grab the... Is that just HP?

3302
03:53:37,950 --> 03:53:38,870
Yeah, that's just HP.

3303
03:53:44,000 --> 03:53:44,860
Wait, what?

3304
03:53:44,860 --> 03:53:45,160
What?

3305
03:53:50,400 --> 03:53:51,480
Down here.

3306
03:53:51,480 --> 03:53:51,720
Down here.

3307
03:53:51,820 --> 03:53:52,780
The mask is up.

3308
03:53:53,300 --> 03:53:53,940
Pulling this way.

3309
03:53:54,900 --> 03:53:56,180
We'll have to find some way down.

3310
03:53:56,740 --> 03:53:57,080
Sure thing.

3311
03:53:58,500 --> 03:54:00,720
I wasn't playing you, by the way.

3312
03:54:01,440 --> 03:54:02,340
The trials are fun.

3313
03:54:02,940 --> 03:54:04,060
Don't you ever have fun?

3314
03:54:05,040 --> 03:54:06,520
You're so different from your daughter.

3315
03:54:07,200 --> 03:54:07,800
She seemed...

3316
03:54:07,800 --> 03:54:08,780
Hey, come look at this.

3317
03:54:09,460 --> 03:54:09,820
Huh?

3318
03:54:10,320 --> 03:54:12,880
Never talk about my daughter again.

3319
03:54:15,880 --> 03:54:18,140
That was good thing he wasn't there when Haimedil...

3320
03:54:18,160 --> 03:54:19,180
caught on.

3321
03:54:21,720 --> 03:54:23,520
Oh my god.

3322
03:54:25,140 --> 03:54:26,920
Wait, Sir, there's shrine.

3323
03:54:27,340 --> 03:54:29,160
You didn't die over there, did you?

3324
03:54:33,090 --> 03:54:34,250
Here we gotta go.

3325
03:54:34,650 --> 03:54:35,250
Oh, reload.

3326
03:54:36,510 --> 03:54:39,130
I don't know if I shoot this if there's, like, money in
there.

3327
03:54:40,110 --> 03:54:41,670
Oh, I fucking knew it.

3328
03:54:42,350 --> 03:54:44,850
I was like, why are these random pots placed there?

3329
03:54:44,910 --> 03:54:46,550
My gamer senses were tingling.

3330
03:54:47,910 --> 03:54:52,590
No, but I was thinking Well, rest in peace, ankles.

3331
03:54:55,170 --> 03:54:57,210
Oh, my God, my poor ankles.

3332
03:54:58,390 --> 03:54:59,790
The trials are just past that cliff.

3333
03:55:00,590 --> 03:55:02,010
Might be something you and Thu can do together.

3334
03:55:02,750 --> 03:55:04,010
First, we deal with them.

3335
03:55:06,250 --> 03:55:07,230
Come on, Thor.

3336
03:55:07,610 --> 03:55:08,470
Just check them out.

3337
03:55:08,930 --> 03:55:09,810
What have you got to lose?

3338
03:55:12,750 --> 03:55:15,350
It's just like, I'm not here to fuck with you, kid.

3339
03:55:16,290 --> 03:55:19,150
I'm just going to get that mission done in and out.

3340
03:55:28,950 --> 03:55:35,130
don't worry door kick you get all of this look at him boom

03:55:56,150 --> 03:55:57,090
Another ogre?

3344
03:55:57,770 --> 03:55:59,070
Oh my god, there's so many ogres.

3345
03:55:59,550 --> 03:56:01,970
Thorin, Thorin, there is a giant ogre here!

3346
03:56:02,470 --> 03:56:03,030

3347
03:56:03,410 --> 03:56:04,450
Can I get some help here?

3348
03:56:04,790 --> 03:56:06,470
His was short on time.

3349
03:56:06,690 --> 03:56:07,830
I'll humor you.

3350
03:56:09,670 --> 03:56:11,010
You just punched nothing.

3351
03:56:11,290 --> 03:56:12,290
He just punched nothing.

3352
03:56:13,150 --> 03:56:16,570
Oh my god, he's hitting everything but the fucking giant ass
ogre.

3353
03:56:17,270 --> 03:56:18,010
Oh my god.

3354
03:56:22,950 --> 03:56:24,710
Oh my god, please, Thor.

3355
03:56:25,170 --> 03:56:25,450
Please!

3356
03:56:27,470 --> 03:56:28,910
He's just one hit!

3357
03:56:31,050 --> 03:56:31,490
Alright, nice.

3358
03:56:32,270 --> 03:56:32,950
Alright, I'll grab.

3359
03:56:34,250 --> 03:56:34,730
Nice.

3360
03:56:35,190 --> 03:56:36,150
That's where Guy did it.

3361
03:56:36,290 --> 03:56:37,750
Alright, I'll grab the archer.

3362
03:56:37,810 --> 03:56:38,550
You grab the other.

3363
03:56:40,650 --> 03:56:41,510
Alright, there we go.

3364
03:56:42,270 --> 03:56:43,010
I can help now.

3365
03:56:43,830 --> 03:56:44,710
Okay, I'm helping!

3366
03:56:47,690 --> 03:56:48,170
Alright.

3367
03:56:49,550 --> 03:56:50,850
Me too!

3368
03:56:52,870 --> 03:56:53,530
Boom!

3369
03:56:54,910 --> 03:56:56,290
See, I can help.

3370
03:56:57,050 --> 03:56:58,550
Thor save us.

3371
03:57:01,210 --> 03:57:03,630
The All Fathers waited hundreds of winters.

3372
03:57:04,150 --> 03:57:05,390
He can wait a little more.

3373
03:57:05,810 --> 03:57:06,370
It's fine.

3374
03:57:07,570 --> 03:57:08,250
Fine.

3375
03:57:08,990 --> 03:57:10,490
Stay right here.

3376
03:57:10,910 --> 03:57:11,390
Yes, sir.

3377
03:57:11,650 --> 03:57:12,970
Oh my god, I get to do the tries?

3378
03:57:14,710 --> 03:57:15,350
How's he doing?

3379
03:57:17,010 --> 03:57:18,170
Holy shit.

3380
03:57:21,270 --> 03:57:21,750
Oh!

3381
03:57:23,150 --> 03:57:24,090
I got the summon!

3382
03:57:24,730 --> 03:57:25,950
Wait, what is this?

3383
03:57:26,130 --> 03:57:26,610
Runic?

3384
03:57:27,190 --> 03:57:30,590
Summon Spectral Falcons that disrupt enemies and dives them
into the ground.

3385
03:57:32,290 --> 03:57:32,890
Oh man, wait.

3386

04:00:06,530 --> 04:00:07,150
She doesn't know.

3417
04:00:09,110 --> 04:00:12,290
How is I supposed to know she would, she could leave?

3418
04:00:13,690 --> 04:00:15,870
You're here for Sorcerer's Marble.

3419
04:00:17,430 --> 04:00:17,710
Maybe.

3420
04:00:19,950 --> 04:00:22,850
You're out looking for more giant marbles.

3421
04:00:24,050 --> 04:00:25,530
You know what this looks like, right?

3422
04:00:26,990 --> 04:00:29,010
The life story of one of our people.

3423
04:00:31,070 --> 04:00:32,470
And also maybe a storage closet.

3424
04:00:34,150 --> 04:00:34,310
No.

3425
04:00:35,230 --> 04:00:37,130
This looks an awful lot like the fine destiny.

3426
04:00:37,270 --> 04:00:40,510
Look, we never said if we were official or not, guys.

3427
04:00:40,650 --> 04:00:41,530
If we were going steady.

3428
04:00:42,030 --> 04:00:43,910
So is it really my fault?

3429
04:00:44,450 --> 04:00:46,810
We never said if we were going steady or not.

3430
04:00:48,310 --> 04:00:48,710
It's not.

3431
04:00:49,150 --> 04:00:51,290
I thought it was a summertime thing.

3432
04:00:51,490 --> 04:00:51,930
But it's not.

3433
04:00:53,270 --> 04:00:54,350
I'm not working with them.

3434
04:00:55,270 --> 04:00:56,970
I would never tell them anything about iron.

3435
04:00:56,990 --> 04:00:58,450
would if that's what you're worried about.

3436
04:00:59,910 --> 04:01:01,130
And I'm definitely not serving him.

3437
04:01:03,270 --> 04:01:04,890
Prophecies words, not mine.

3438
04:01:06,870 --> 04:01:07,830
I've got a marble to find.

3439
04:01:12,410 --> 04:01:13,850
You're welcome to help if you want.

3440
04:01:15,450 --> 04:01:15,810
Fine.

3441
04:01:16,750 --> 04:01:18,610
But are you sure you're up for breaking the rules like this?

3442
04:01:18,950 --> 04:01:19,990
Damn, she wild.

3443
04:01:20,470 --> 04:01:22,230
Prophecies of you collecting any marbles.

3444
04:01:22,610 --> 04:01:24,210
Yeah, but she's her own person now.

3445
04:01:24,390 --> 04:01:25,310
And there's haven't been written, right?

3446
04:01:26,230 --> 04:01:27,090
Come on.

3447
04:01:27,750 --> 04:01:28,090
Shame.

3448
04:01:34,680 --> 04:01:36,160
Oh, hello there.

3449
04:01:37,460 --> 04:01:38,560
A sentient sword.

3450
04:01:39,600 --> 04:01:39,700
Huh.

3451
04:01:40,640 --> 04:01:41,060
Another marble.

3452
04:01:41,820 --> 04:01:42,280
Surders.

3453
04:01:43,700 --> 04:01:44,820
No soul in it, though.

3454
04:01:45,220 --> 04:01:46,260
So he's still out there somewhere.

3455
04:01:46,480 --> 04:01:48,020
Oh, that means he's alive, right?

3456
04:01:48,040 --> 04:01:48,540
A while back.

3457
04:01:48,980 --> 04:01:50,340
You talked about how the giants left.

3458
04:01:51,320 --> 04:01:52,240
You ever think about them?

3459
04:01:52,680 --> 04:01:53,420
All the time.

3460
04:01:54,220 --> 04:01:55,060
They're far from here.

3461
04:01:55,580 --> 04:01:57,640
Far from Odin and Thor.

3462
04:01:58,780 --> 04:02:01,020
But I wonder what lands they've gone to.

3463
04:02:01,580 --> 04:02:02,680
What seas they've crossed.

3464
04:02:03,460 --> 04:02:15,540
what I want to find them I'm gonna save my father and then
I'll find them it's starting oh who is that not surter

3465
04:02:15,540 --> 04:02:26,560
that's for sure look at all that frost hmm don't think I've
heard of her before and here comes surter wow this must have

3466
04:02:26,560 --> 04:02:33,860
been some fight yeah until it wasn't I saw they fell oh Oh,
no, no, look.

3467
04:02:34,060 --> 04:02:35,260
Oh, they fought together.

3468
04:02:35,960 --> 04:02:37,380
They're in love.

3469
04:02:38,480 --> 04:02:39,940
Looks like they even became friends.

3470
04:02:40,440 --> 04:02:41,940
Oh, more than friends.

3471
04:02:42,600 --> 04:02:46,560
Oh, yeah, just really, really good friends.

3472
04:02:46,940 --> 04:02:48,960
Just roommates, you know?

3473
04:02:50,160 --> 04:02:51,520
Is that what friends do?

3474
04:02:54,500 --> 04:02:57,880
Love caused them to combine into some kind of huge creature.

3475
04:02:57,940 --> 04:02:58,640
Oh, my God.

3476
04:02:59,560 --> 04:03:02,500
And then, Ragnarok destroys Asgard.

3477
04:03:02,800 --> 04:03:03,300
Right.

3478
04:03:04,000 --> 04:03:05,140
I saw that in Grower's shrine.

3479
04:03:05,820 --> 04:03:05,880
Oh.

3480
04:03:08,880 --> 04:03:09,840
They fused.

3481
04:03:10,620 --> 04:03:11,080
Oh, hey.

3482
04:03:11,800 --> 04:03:13,100
Remember the snake we put that soul in?

3483
04:03:13,420 --> 04:03:14,360
Can't really forget that.

3484
04:03:14,440 --> 04:03:16,160
Yeah, I was going to say, Steven Universe?

3485
04:03:16,400 --> 04:03:17,940
It's getting bigger.

3486
04:03:18,600 --> 04:03:21,180
Like, faster than normal figure.

3487
04:03:21,900 --> 04:03:23,880
Yeah, I had a feeling that would happen.

3488
04:03:24,320 --> 04:03:24,460
Huh.

3489
04:03:25,940 --> 04:03:27,420
I'm going to hang back here.

3490
04:03:27,960 --> 04:03:31,200
Don't want your friend to see a giant he missed.

3491
04:03:31,580 --> 04:03:32,140
Of course.

3492
04:03:32,800 --> 04:03:34,480
Just be careful.

3493
04:03:36,780 --> 04:03:37,360
You too, Loki.

3494
04:03:40,940 --> 04:03:42,620
I know, they like crystal fused.

3495
04:03:43,300 --> 04:03:44,540
They're like marble fusing.

3496
04:03:45,320 --> 04:03:45,720
Hey, Ingrid.

3497
04:03:47,080 --> 04:03:49,200
I think Thor died from...

3498
04:03:49,200 --> 04:03:52,840
You thought you could defeat the god of thunder?

3499
04:03:53,280 --> 04:03:53,500
Oh.

3500
04:03:54,740 --> 04:03:56,860
Yeah, no, I think he's very much alive.

3501
04:04:02,860 --> 04:04:04,300
He did a fusion dance.

3502
04:04:04,980 --> 04:04:05,460
Okay.

3503
04:04:09,100 --> 04:04:11,120
All right, let's go.

3504
04:04:11,460 --> 04:04:13,360
Got more HP that I don't need.

3505
04:04:17,980 --> 04:04:19,040
Of course.

3506
04:04:19,700 --> 04:04:21,580
I admit, that was fun.

3507
04:04:22,220 --> 04:04:25,160
There were mountains of corpses by the time I finished.

3508
04:04:25,380 --> 04:04:27,300
Cut down like wheat.

3509
04:04:27,860 --> 04:04:29,280
Yeah, I told you.

3510
04:04:31,000 --> 04:04:31,560
Great.

3511
04:04:32,040 --> 04:04:32,960
You want to help down here?

3512
04:04:33,200 --> 04:04:34,560
I'm not done.

3513
04:04:35,140 --> 04:04:36,580
If you beat all those trials.

3514
04:04:37,340 --> 04:04:39,640
Or did you just watch your father do it?

3515
04:04:40,780 --> 04:04:58,540
I'm meaty hey I was still learning oh my god what the fuck

3516
04:04:58,540 --> 04:05:08,240

glorious yeah you're right maybe I should have watched why

3517
04:05:08,240 --> 04:05:14,740

than you, at least.

3518
04:05:16,840 --> 04:05:18,100
I'm trying my best!

3519
04:05:21,640 --> 04:05:23,920
Look, it's literally a water gets 20.

3520
04:05:24,020 --> 04:05:24,720
What do you want from me?

3521
04:05:27,760 --> 04:05:32,920
Bro, this stupid fucking archers.

3522
04:05:33,780 --> 04:05:34,480
Oh my god, that's right.

3523
04:05:34,540 --> 04:05:35,280
Get out of here.

3524
04:05:36,160 --> 04:05:37,400
I hate these guys the most.

3525
04:05:40,600 --> 04:05:41,300
There you go.

3526
04:05:44,000 --> 04:05:53,860

god wait how much hp does this guy have i'm gonna grab him

3527
04:05:53,860 --> 04:06:02,740

done that at any time you seem to be handling yourself well

3528
04:06:02,740 --> 04:06:13,840
enough i was trusting you so where to let me check I think
it's this way.

3529
04:06:14,540 --> 04:06:15,820
Looks like we need to head through that gate.

3530
04:06:16,300 --> 04:06:18,480
Yeah, I was going to say that has a lot of HP.

3531
04:06:19,900 --> 04:06:21,480
Ain't that impressive?

3532
04:06:22,540 --> 04:06:24,400
Real god stuff.

3533
04:06:24,880 --> 04:06:26,020
You are a god.

3534
04:06:26,340 --> 04:06:27,420
You're damn right.

3535
04:06:27,760 --> 04:06:28,940
And so am I.

3536
04:06:30,520 --> 04:06:35,360
And it's like, yeah, but I can't believe this boy is in the
same.

3537
04:06:36,640 --> 04:06:39,000
It's in the same category as me.

3538
04:06:40,120 --> 04:06:40,580
I can't.

3539
04:06:41,320 --> 04:06:41,400
This is the spot.

3540
04:06:41,420 --> 04:07:01,100
in the lava i don't know oh shit oh there's the other mass
whoa oh what the fuck damn it some advice but maybe yeah i

3541
04:07:01,100 --> 04:07:12,020
was gonna say it wasn't thinking good it's better that way
all right let's get out of here oh just a little bird Loki

3542
04:07:12,020 --> 04:07:26,920
don't try to play me again you're an okay kid but you're
still a giant and a reveling oh he's like you might be a god

3543
04:07:26,920 --> 04:07:36,440
but we are not the same the riff got brighter look you did
it look one of these phrases is complete now we can read it

3544
04:07:36,440 --> 04:07:43,620
all but you can't translate it not yet see I got a little
theory I think if we can find the rest of this we can use it

3545
04:07:43,620 --> 04:07:53,180
to look into that without you know losing an eye or worse
look at this we make a good team don't we don't we make a

3546
04:07:53,180 --> 04:08:04,540
good damn team oh he's jealous uh you both behave out there
thor is jealous right now it was really great i learned a

3547
04:08:04,540 --> 04:08:14,780
lot from him he's like what about me your actual son really
now he's just like what teach the kid what about me father

3548
04:08:14,780 --> 04:08:20,020
nothing what could i possibly teach him exactly

3549
04:08:23,360 --> 04:08:35,760
ah i was wondering where that went actually i had a pretty
good idea change of heart i'm not really sure why i came

3550
04:08:35,760 --> 04:08:37,880
back it reminds me of the mask

3551
04:08:42,000 --> 04:08:49,460
I need you to know you can trust that mask was made by Loki
as well take this to the end I need to be able to trust you

3552
04:08:49,460 --> 04:08:59,940
and trust is earned I get it take this figure out the rest
of it if you're staying that is you're gonna tell me what

3553
04:08:59,940 --> 04:09:09,460
you're really looking for in there translate that and I'll
tell you everything and on that young man you can trust me

3554
04:09:14,140 --> 04:09:23,080
yeah yeah Jim Carrey one guys that's definitely the one I
was talking about I was actually thinking more so the I like

3555
04:09:23,080 --> 04:09:30,360
the animated series more always this hard on Thor seems like
you're mad at him or something I want to touch it what if I

3556
04:09:30,360 --> 04:09:40,180
touch it right now what if I touch it right now yeah the
movie that doesn't have the sequel yeah yeah definitely it's

3557
04:09:40,180 --> 04:09:45,740
not I definitely did not half the DVD of any sequel movies.

3558
04:09:59,700 --> 04:09:59,880
Oh.

3559
04:10:00,720 --> 04:10:03,400
Oh, these are cool.

3560
04:10:04,440 --> 04:10:07,140
That wood carving of the wolves.

3561
04:10:07,380 --> 04:10:08,120
Oh, chest.

3562
04:10:09,280 --> 04:10:10,360
Yeah, there was a cartoon.

3563
04:10:18,750 --> 04:10:20,430
Yeah, I guess we go up now.

3564
04:10:20,830 --> 04:10:21,250
Oh, wait.

3565
04:10:21,350 --> 04:10:22,070
There's more stuff.

3566
04:10:22,850 --> 04:10:24,130
I knew there was more stuff here.

3567
04:10:24,730 --> 04:10:25,950
More free stuff.

3568
04:10:28,070 --> 04:10:28,510
Nice.

3569
04:10:28,750 --> 04:10:29,090
I can't be there.

3570
04:10:29,170 --> 04:10:31,910
We just leave money lying here in the open.

3571
04:10:34,050 --> 04:10:35,590
Free money just for me.

3572
04:10:36,510 --> 04:10:37,770
The Jim Carrey movie was good.

3573
04:10:38,170 --> 04:10:38,510
It was.

3574
04:10:39,650 --> 04:10:40,590
I... I... Okay.

3575
04:10:40,970 --> 04:10:42,370
I... Personally... Okay.

3576
04:10:42,550 --> 04:10:43,230
I know I'm gonna be judged.

3577
04:10:43,310 --> 04:10:46,170
But I actually liked all iterations of the mask.

3578
04:10:46,270 --> 04:10:47,170
Like Son of a Mask.

3579
04:10:47,310 --> 04:10:47,850
The mask.

3580
04:10:47,930 --> 04:10:49,110
The animated shows.

3581
04:10:49,830 --> 04:10:51,110
I think they were all pretty good.

3582
04:10:51,270 --> 04:10:52,050
In my opinion.

3583
04:10:52,590 --> 04:10:54,570
I very much enjoyed all of them.

3584
04:10:55,670 --> 04:10:56,110

Are you trying to make friends now?

3595
04:11:51,740 --> 04:11:52,640
What's wrong with that?

3596
04:11:52,660 --> 04:11:53,920
Well, I just aided the Our Father.

3597
04:11:54,180 --> 04:11:54,520

3598
04:11:54,520 --> 04:11:55,720
You said that makes us allies.

3599
04:11:56,020 --> 04:11:58,780
Yes, as long as you had no treacherous.

3600
04:12:01,660 --> 04:12:02,140
Interesting.

3601
04:12:02,660 --> 04:12:03,060

3602
04:12:06,260 --> 04:12:20,340

he always sees the best in people while all I see is what

3603
04:12:20,340 --> 04:12:30,440
people really are nobody ever says what they mean some lie
to the world some lie to themselves and don't even know it

3604
04:12:30,440 --> 04:12:38,500
and then there is you mm-hmm you don't know what you want
you You don't even know who you are.

3605
04:12:38,560 --> 04:12:40,620
I still have a couple years to figure that out.

3606
04:12:40,740 --> 04:12:42,260
I'm just a little boy.

3607
04:12:44,160 --> 04:12:45,760
I will be watching.

3608
04:12:46,640 --> 04:12:49,120
He said I still have time to figure out.

3609
04:12:51,520 --> 04:12:53,040
Fabs, thank you for the super chat.

3610
04:12:53,220 --> 04:12:53,380
Thank you.

3611
04:12:53,660 --> 04:12:54,160
Thank you.

3612
04:12:54,320 --> 04:12:55,860
You're not saying just saving money.

3613
04:12:56,040 --> 04:12:56,880
That's exactly.

3614
04:12:58,740 --> 04:13:02,200
Silly all-father leaving the money just lying around here.

3615
04:13:02,360 --> 04:13:04,000
I'm just giving them a safe place.

3616
04:13:04,880 --> 04:13:06,240
I'm just giving the money a safe place.

3617
04:13:06,260 --> 04:13:19,460
to be well this has been a weird day you know I'm like a
little personal bank for him anything new here oh nicely

3618
04:13:19,460 --> 04:13:31,990
equipped what needs work oh I can just upgrade this again
let's go missed dialogue it was some Asgardian woman talking

3619
04:13:31,990 --> 04:13:34,910
she doesn't even have a name so it's not really missed
dialogue

3620
04:13:38,110 --> 04:13:39,590
She didn't have a name, guys.

3621
04:13:39,730 --> 04:13:42,030
I don't think the dialogue would have been that important.

3622
04:13:45,170 --> 04:13:46,670
Wait, go to Thor's room?

3623
04:13:47,590 --> 04:13:49,070
Oh, I could have eavesdropped?

3624
04:13:50,370 --> 04:13:51,810
Oh, I didn't realize.

3625
04:13:52,090 --> 04:13:56,430
I thought you guys meant, like, the fucking random woman
that was talking at the dinner table.

3626
04:13:58,910 --> 04:14:02,850
Oh, I didn't even realize Thor's room was next to mine.

3627
04:14:04,370 --> 04:14:05,770
Oh, it's too late now.

3628
04:14:06,210 --> 04:14:06,550
Oops.

3629
04:14:08,150 --> 04:14:09,750
What were they gonna say anyway?

3630
04:14:29,570 --> 04:14:30,070
Huh?

3631
04:14:32,110 --> 04:14:33,110
My father.

3632
04:14:36,960 --> 04:14:38,000
I don't need him.

3633
04:14:38,140 --> 04:14:39,280
I have a new dad now.

3634
04:14:39,480 --> 04:14:40,880
He gave me a shining new.

3635
04:14:41,180 --> 04:14:43,340
He gave me a shining new sword.

3636
04:14:44,560 --> 04:14:46,960
Papa never gave me that sword before.

3637
04:14:54,080 --> 04:14:56,540
Yeah, that scene transition was really nice.

3638
04:15:12,670 --> 04:15:13,290
Good morning, brother.

3639
04:15:14,150 --> 04:15:14,970
No news, I'm afraid.

3640
04:15:15,730 --> 04:15:16,630
I have a plan.

3641
04:15:17,270 --> 04:15:18,130
Do you not?

3642
04:15:19,610 --> 04:15:21,110
What is it?

3643
04:15:25,380 --> 04:15:25,880
The Nords.

3644
04:15:28,200 --> 04:15:29,140
You found them once.

3645
04:15:29,640 --> 04:15:30,520
Could you do so again?

3646
04:15:32,320 --> 04:15:35,600
I could try, but I don't see how that would help.

3647
04:15:35,600 --> 04:15:37,520
They are the fates of these lands, are they not?

3648
04:15:39,340 --> 04:15:40,600
I would know what they know.

3649
04:15:42,080 --> 04:15:43,720
You may not find them cooperative.

3650
04:15:44,040 --> 04:15:45,440
As long as I find them.

3651
04:15:46,320 --> 04:15:47,160
Where do we search?

3652
04:15:50,120 --> 04:15:50,680
Midgard.

3653
04:15:51,560 --> 04:15:55,180
But if Atreus is an Asgard, there's no getting him back
without an army.

3654
04:15:55,560 --> 04:15:57,040
We should be raising one.

3655
04:15:57,400 --> 04:16:00,760
Yes, nothing like a catastrophic war to improve the
situation.

3656
04:16:02,260 --> 04:16:05,400
The boy seems quite capable, perhaps if you simply give him
some time.

3657
04:16:05,680 --> 04:16:07,560
You are not free of harm here.

3658
04:16:09,800 --> 04:16:11,760
You encouraged his foolishness.

3659
04:16:11,880 --> 04:16:13,580
You're not his father!

3660
04:16:15,880 --> 04:16:18,080
How dare you tell me what to do?

3661
04:16:18,220 --> 04:16:19,660
How to raise my son?

3662
04:16:20,080 --> 04:16:21,980
if Odin has stolen my son.

3663
04:16:22,200 --> 04:16:24,180
Do not doubt the lengths I will go to.

3664
04:16:25,400 --> 04:16:27,120
Your nature has always been clear, Kratos.

3665
04:16:28,500 --> 04:16:29,340
But you, Freya.

3666
04:16:31,920 --> 04:16:33,480
War is a first resort.

3667
04:16:34,900 --> 04:16:36,180
That's not the Freya I knew.

3668
04:16:37,960 --> 04:16:40,580
I hope the Norns can give you the counsel you need.

3669
04:16:41,740 --> 04:16:43,760
Perhaps mine is no longer of use here.

3670
04:16:46,960 --> 04:16:48,160
Tear, stop.

3671
04:16:48,720 --> 04:16:50,060
This is no time to define you.

3672
04:16:50,080 --> 04:16:55,240
ourselves further come sit please

3673
04:16:58,340 --> 04:17:07,280
you have been quiet frankly I'm surprised you of all people
would seek out fate yeah I thought you don't believe in that

3674
04:17:07,280 --> 04:17:25,380
shit your instincts haven't let us down so far let's find
the norms your tears stop being a drama queen who am I to

3675
04:17:25,380 --> 04:17:34,040
offer him counsel I only hoped to help the boy find his
answers and I failed What's my role in all this now?

3676
04:17:34,560 --> 04:17:41,200
Tear you're at the center of this you always have been
you're literally the one to start the Ragnarok shit He's

3677
04:17:41,200 --> 04:17:42,400
terrified of you.

3678
04:17:42,640 --> 04:17:44,000
I doubt that very much.

3679
04:17:44,500 --> 04:17:51,800
It's the truth and not just because of prophecies Literally
your purpose United the realms as you once did that is not

3680
04:17:51,800 --> 04:17:52,940
who I am anymore.

3681
04:17:53,400 --> 04:18:02,120
I know you feel that way now I've lost myself before more
than once but believe me there is something beyond that and

3682
04:18:02,120 --> 04:18:11,460
what is that purpose purpose is the path that leads you to
yourself so you would have me accept my fate lead your

3683
04:18:11,460 --> 04:18:21,880
armies into war secure your vengeance yes if securing our
justice is not your purpose then find another for your own

3684
04:18:21,880 --> 04:18:33,020
sake just find some sort of hobby man moping around is not
going to do us any justice it's not going to do anything

3685
04:18:33,020 --> 04:18:40,960
just find at least a hobby that's all we want from you tear
don't try to talk me into coming I mean I wasn't in their

3686
04:18:40,960 --> 04:18:50,960
tales of our fates it's everything I've walked in a job stop
eating if you're going to contribute to society Get a

3687
04:18:50,960 --> 04:18:53,560
fucking job and stop mooching off of our food.

3688
04:18:53,720 --> 04:18:55,260
And my house, by the way.

3689
04:18:55,660 --> 04:18:57,020
And my fucking house.

3690
04:19:01,430 --> 04:19:01,730
All right.

3691
04:19:02,710 --> 04:19:04,990
You did a job, you bum.

3692
04:19:10,680 --> 04:19:14,140
All right, don't we have any upgrades that we need to do?

3693
04:19:14,980 --> 04:19:16,060
No, I think we don't.

3694
04:19:16,200 --> 04:19:16,940
And we're fine.

3695
04:19:23,060 --> 04:19:23,700
Does it hurt?

3696
04:19:24,240 --> 04:19:24,680
Oh, this?

3697
04:19:25,560 --> 04:19:26,420
Only when I worry.

3698
04:19:27,380 --> 04:19:30,040
Um, technically it's my house because I literally funded...

3699
04:19:30,060 --> 04:19:31,460
Sindri's entire career.

3700
04:19:31,900 --> 04:19:34,060
So they might as well build this with my money.

3701
04:19:34,940 --> 04:19:36,300
So it is my house.

3702
04:19:38,920 --> 04:19:39,500
Hang on.

3703
04:19:40,120 --> 04:19:41,760
I got something for you.

3704
04:19:43,220 --> 04:19:43,480
Sindri.

3705
04:19:44,040 --> 04:19:44,340
Coming.

3706
04:19:45,320 --> 04:19:50,340
Before you go traipsing off into Gdawn, I thought you'd like
to have this back.

3707
04:19:50,680 --> 04:19:51,480
Oh, nice.

3708
04:19:51,620 --> 04:19:52,560
My shield.

3709
04:19:54,780 --> 04:19:57,860
Well, don't go getting too cheery about it.

3710
04:19:58,620 --> 04:19:59,720
But you're welcome.

3711
04:20:00,060 --> 04:20:02,360
My money literally built this place.

3712
04:20:03,280 --> 04:20:04,120
Shall we go?

3713
04:20:04,580 --> 04:20:08,720
Stop being your money when you gave it to him.

3714
04:20:10,140 --> 04:20:11,840
I loaned it to them.

3715
04:20:11,840 --> 04:20:13,860
I said that you may have consequences to look for.

3716
04:20:13,880 --> 04:20:15,720
I lended it to them.

3717
04:20:19,260 --> 04:20:19,680
Hello?

3718
04:20:20,060 --> 04:20:20,500
Squirrel.

3719
04:20:20,980 --> 04:20:23,140
Ah, Master Kratos, my apologies.

3720
04:20:23,640 --> 04:20:26,820
Madam Nithogue's disappearance weighs heavily on my mind.

3721
04:20:27,140 --> 04:20:28,780
She a friend of yours?

3722
04:20:28,880 --> 04:20:29,640
Oh, the worm.

3723
04:20:30,060 --> 04:20:31,160
Yeah, what happened to the worm?

3724
04:20:31,720 --> 04:20:32,520
Tenant of the tree.

3725
04:20:33,320 --> 04:20:36,780
She was here even before I arrived, and that was ages ago.

3726
04:20:37,680 --> 04:20:40,460
To even think something could keep her away from her babies.

3727
04:20:41,000 --> 04:20:42,340
Terrible, just terrible.

3728
04:20:46,460 --> 04:20:47,160
Was that it?

3729
04:20:48,240 --> 04:20:48,660
Okay.

3730
04:20:54,950 --> 04:20:57,570
Alright, we gotta go to Midgard!

3731
04:20:58,030 --> 04:20:58,750
What's over here?

3732
04:20:58,850 --> 04:21:00,590
Eyes of Odin, a Crucible.

3733
04:21:02,190 --> 04:21:03,530
Stuff that don't matter.

3734
04:21:04,210 --> 04:21:07,750
still haven't unlocked three of these worlds yet.

3735
04:21:09,130 --> 04:21:11,370
There's still three more places we have to unlock.

3736
04:21:15,790 --> 04:21:17,570
Oh, wait, I killed the worm.

3737
04:21:18,030 --> 04:21:18,510
Oh, yeah.

3738
04:21:19,090 --> 04:21:19,810
Oh, yeah.

3739
04:21:21,470 --> 04:21:26,270
Oh, I just remembered I killed the worm.

3740
04:21:27,430 --> 04:21:28,430
Oh, that's awkward.

3741
04:21:28,790 --> 04:21:29,750
That is not the only answer.

3742
04:21:30,150 --> 04:21:31,270
All right, well, they don't know.

3743
04:21:31,910 --> 04:21:32,470
They don't know.

3744
04:21:32,570 --> 04:21:35,270
The babies don't know any also, so they won't get revenge.

3745
04:21:35,870 --> 04:21:42,330
near the frozen lake i stashed one for spell crafting but we
may yeah i just remember it but the worm we killed with fear

3746
04:21:42,330 --> 04:21:47,410
they really don't want to be found well at least things will
be difficult for a

3747
04:21:50,870 --> 04:22:00,730
change i want to access this next area your sled and head to
the lake all right oh is this save here where is the saving
