00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,790
You wanna- you wanna get out of here?

175
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:09,790
You know you want to.

176
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,290
Oh my god.

177
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,570
Come on.

178
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:16,190
Come on.

179
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,070
Let's- let's get out of here.

180
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:21,750
I have a long day planned for us, Dragoon.

181
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,810
That's right.

182
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,950
You think- You think I wouldn't?

183
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:32,170
Of course I- it's our one year- wait, how many years?

184
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,030
I don't know.

185
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,850
Oh wait, one year anniversary since our first date.

186
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:39,630
Of course I have a big day planned for all of us.

187
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,250
You think I wouldn't?

188
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:42,890
Oh my god.

189
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:47,590
You really think I would- I would do that to you, Dragoon?

190
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:48,510
Come on.

191
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:49,670
Let's go.

192
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,630
Let's go.

193
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,970
You're gonna love this date.

194
00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:00,390
Happy- happy birthday to me.

195
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:07,570
Hey.

196
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,950
Oh sh- give me a sec.

197
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,070
I forgot to be dressed for the occasion.

198
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,610
Oh wait, there we go.

199
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:18,990
But you thought that was it?

200
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,430
I gotta wear sunglasses.

201
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,850
I'm practically a celebrity, you know?

202
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:26,910
Can't let them know I'm here.

203
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:27,470
Yeah.

204
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,610
Can't let them know, babe.

205
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:36,610
Like, the paparazzi might catch me.

206
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:41,270
So like, I gotta wear these sunglasses so they won't know I'm here.

207
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,390
Don't worry.

208
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,150
Don't worry.

209
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,910
We're- we'll be- we're exclusive, okay?

210
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:49,050
I'm not seeing anyone else, Dragoon.

211
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:49,930
I swear to god.

212
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,110
You and I...

213
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,030
You and I...

214
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:53,910
We're exclusive.

215
00:17:59,010 --> 00:17:59,930
Don't worry.

216
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,470
You like this restaurant I brought you?

217
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:06,950
The best that Doki Bird's money can buy.

218
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,870
What do you mean of the other dog-sitters?

219
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:17,070
Babe, babe, baby, baby, baby, baby.

220
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:20,790
You know, you're the only dog-sitter for me.

221
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,430
You know that.

222
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:30,490
There's no- I might look at, you know, there might be so many other pretty ladies around.

223
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:34,310
But my eyes are only for you, babe.

224
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,170
You know that.

225
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,370
I would never.

226
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:47,010
I can't believe you would say- I'm- I'm giving you a- I'm giving you a free meal.

227
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:52,170
And you think these eyes are looking at anybody else?

228
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:56,530
I can't see your- you can't see my eyes?

229
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:59,610
Look, look, look, look, babe.

230
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,370
Baby, baby, baby, baby.

231
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,510
Drag- drag babe.

232
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,810
Good babe.

233
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,190
Babe goon.

234
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,830
Babe goon.

235
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:13,930
You- You know.

236
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:19,110
You know, you know I would never do anything.

237
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,870
You know, you know that.

238
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:24,550
Like, these eyes are just for you.

239
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,510
Babe goon, you know that.

240
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:33,690
I would never look at anybody else other than you.

241
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:37,950
I mean, how could you say that on my birthday?

242
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:42,270
Come on, it's our first year anniversary.

243
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,570
And our birthday.

244
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:49,450
Happy birthday, Polly babe.

245
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,370
Thank you for the super chat.

246
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:52,110
Thank you.

247
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:52,810
Thank you.

248
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:53,930
Look at that.

249
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:54,690
You know what?

250
00:19:55,770 --> 00:20:03,590
Some say they don't- people don't have favorites, but I definitely have a favorite and it's you.

251
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,050
Yes, you.

252
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,930
Yes, I'm talking about you there.

253
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,470
Of course, you over there.

254
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:11,870
You're my favorite.

255
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,990
You're my favorite.

256
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:18,330
That's right.

257
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:19,810
Yeah, you.

258
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,350
You over there.

259
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,250
You, I'm talking about you.

260
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,610
That's right.

261
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:25,790
Yes, you.

262
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,390
Just you.

263
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,070
Nobody else.

264
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,750
Don't tell the other dragoons though.

265
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:35,230
I'm talking just specifically you.

266
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:40,710
Weird.

267
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,370
What do you mean weird?

268
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:47,210
I am the main star of this channel.

269
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:51,090
How dare you call me weird?

270
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:55,590
Doki Bridge channel could never do anything without me.

271
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:59,810
I can't believe you would say such a thing.

272
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,750
Oh my god.

273
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:03,170
I am so insulted.

274
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,930
How dare you insult me like-

275
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,110
I'll be right back.

276
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:17,290
Hey there, pretty lady.

277
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:23,530
Do you need a new dog to dog sit?

278
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,470
Here's my number.

279
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,070
Sorry.

280
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:28,510
Sorry.

281
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:28,910
Sorry.

282
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:29,530
Sorry.

283
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,190
I had to use the bathroom real quick.

284
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:34,150
I hope- Babe, I hope I didn't miss anything.

285
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,570
Uh, while I was in the bathroom.

286
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:42,770
Don't- Don't worry.

287
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:43,290
Don't worry.

288
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:46,110
My eyes are for you only.

289
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:55,690
I would never do any- I would never do anything other than look at you, dragoons.

290
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:59,530
Do not- Do not worry.

291
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:10,390
No other pretty lady would ever steal my attention away from you.

292
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:12,730
Do not worry.

293
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,250
I- I swear to god.

294
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:29,680
Anyway, man, you gotta eat your, you know, gotta eat your- eat this lovely dinner I bought for myself.

295
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,000
You're not hungry?

296
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,340
Uh, it's all right.

297
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:32,900
Don't worry.

298
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,320
That's why I ordered one thing for me.

299
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,240
Give me a sec.

300
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,480
Let me- let me eat this real quick.

301
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,280
Give me a sec.

302
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,560
And then we'll move on to the next part of our date.

303
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,840
Don't worry, babe.

304
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,420
I have a long day planned for us.

305
00:22:52,790 --> 00:23:02,130
Oh Ah delicious Anyway, um, I sort of forgot to bring my wallet.

306
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:06,410
Uh, because like I'm a dog with no pockets.

307
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:13,350
Uh You- you wouldn't mind footing the bill, right?

308
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:21,590
Yes, it is my birthday, you know, like it could be like my per- You know, your birthday gift to me, you know?

309
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:25,650
I- I- Yeah, you know, come on.

310
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:26,310
Come on.

311
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:26,610
Really?

312
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:29,810
Can you really say no to this face?

313
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:30,850
Can you really?

314
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:42,660
Come on, come on, you know you want to pay for the meal.

315
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,620
Come on, look.

316
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,400
Hey

00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:57,440
Look it's just um, I just- I just have nowhere else to put- put the pack- put- put my wallet, guys.

318
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,380
Medi, thank you.

319
00:23:59,440 --> 00:23:59,940
Oh my god.

320
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,640
Thank you for footing the bill, Medi.

321
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:05,120
I really- I really appreciate paying for this meal for me.

322
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,060
Uh, here's the bill, dad.

323
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,300
Thank you for the super chat.

324
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:10,780
Thank you.

325
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,640
Thank you.

326
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,480
Um, uh, fine, you better- don't worry.

327
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,620
Don't- I- I got you.

328
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,300
Don't worry.

329
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,920
It's just, you know, it's my birthday.

330
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,360
It's my birthday.

331
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:27,120
So like, you know, I- I- I can't just foot the bill on my birthday, but thank you for the Akasupa.

332
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:27,940
Thank you.

333
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,660
Thank you.

334
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,960
Don't worry, guys.

335
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,000
I'll- I'll 100% for sure will cover the bill next time.

336
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,440
You have my word.

337
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,260
I would never lie to you guys.

338
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:42,060
Guys, you- my eyes are only for you.

339
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,920
Just only you.

340
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,700
Nom, thank you for the Magenta Supa.

341
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:49,360
Thank you.

342
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,140
Thank you.

343
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:51,900
Hey, dad.

344
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:56,100
Any idea if the actual babysitter will ever upload her Twitch vods?

345
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,980
What is this?

346
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,880
This is my birthday and you're talking about the most irrelevant person in the room?

347
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,360
How dare you?

348
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,180
I refuse to read further.

349
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,700
All right, come on.

350
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,460
Come on.

351
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,040
Come on, babe goons.

352
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,800
I'll take you to somewhere special.

353
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,380
Don't worry.

354
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:23,360
I have a long day planned for my birthday.

355
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,380
Don't worry.

356
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:24,740
Come on.

357
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,400
Let's go.

358
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,360
Give me a sec.

359
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,140
All right, let me- I just gotta use the bathroom again.

360
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:29,980
Give me a sec.

361
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,740
Hey there, I don't like- you know what?

362
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,000
You wanna- you wanna meet up tomorrow?

363
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,400
I might be needing a new babysitter.

364
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:41,620
Yeah.

365
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,280
Yeah, call me.

366
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,480
Oh, hey.

367
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,260
Hey, I'm back.

368
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:48,640
Sorry.

369
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:49,980
Um, yeah.

370
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:54,760
Yeah, I don't know if you know this, but like dogs- dogs can pee really fast.

371
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,100
Anyway, let's- let's go to our- let's- Let's-

372
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:02,220
Let's go somewhere else.

373
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,640
Somewhere private.

374
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,580
Wow.

375
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,400
Isn't this beautiful?

376
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,000
We can't- oh.

377
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:23,560
We're really high up, so like don't do anything stupid.

378
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:32,960
It's just you and me, dragons.

379
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,860
Up in the ferris wheel.

380
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,020
Isn't it romantic?

381
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:44,420
Oh my god, look at the beautiful stars out there.

382
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:53,760
Look, babe, it's not cheating, okay?

383
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,860
She meant nothing to me.

384
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,500
Look, we're just- She was- she- look.

385
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:00,880
She was pretty.

386
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,240
Yes.

387
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:01,580
Yes.

388
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,640
She was pretty, but look.

389
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,960
It was nothing, okay?

390
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:16,040
And look, we're- look, there's- this is a fully packed- like, I know that maybe like the- We're high up and there might not be any witnesses, but look.

391
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:19,120
Look, she meant nothing, okay?

392
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:24,720
There's so many pretty ladies in the world, but I'm here with you.

393
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,560
You.

394
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,940
Look, me- I wasn't the one that was late, okay?

395
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,820
It was Doki Bird's fault.

396
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,160
I was waiting.

397
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:37,560
I was been waiting at the cafe for like at least 20 minutes.

398
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:42,080
So in the end, we have to blame one- if we're blaming anybody.

399
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,520
We're blaming Doki Bird.

400
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,320
Not Doki Amber Doge.

401
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,860
Not dad, which is me.

402
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,160
But Doki Bird.

403
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,580
So like, it's not my fault that she was late.

404
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,960
I'm just a dog.

405
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,440
What the fuck can I do?

406
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:03,040
What- what can I do?

407
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,560
I'm just a dog.

408
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,900
What do you expect from me?

409
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:18,880
Look, look, my eyes are only for you.

410
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,380
Isn't this beautiful?

411
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,420
The night sky.

412
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,320
On my birthday.

413
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,860
Oh my god.

414
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:40,620
You know, I'm really happy to spend my birthday with you dragons.

415
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,400
It really is.

416
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,580
I heard- I heard Doki Bird.

417
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,540
I heard the other Doki- the irrelevant Doki.

418
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,760
You know, Doki 2.

419
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,140
She like bought me a lot of- she bought me a cake.

420
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,060
And like, she also bought me some toys.

421
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,080
But I don't care about that.

422
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,460
You know that, babe.

423
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,020
I only care about you.

424
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,700
Yes, you.

425
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,160
I'm talking about you right now.

426
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,800
Not the other dragons.

427
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,400
But you.

428
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,060
You're my special dragon.

429
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:24,270
Very spe- Don't tell the other dragons.

430
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:25,890
That's right.

431
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,910
You know who you are.

432
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:38,550
Transient, thank you for the super chat.

433
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:39,070
Thank you.

434
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:39,890
Thank you.

435
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:45,110
My birthday was yesterday, but it got lost in the fun collab chaos.

436
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:48,390
Can I get a dad edition of happy birthday song?

437
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:49,730
Oh my god.

438
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,770
It's both our birthdays.

439
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,190
Of course we can.

440
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,510
Let's celebrate it together.

441
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:58,990
Happy birthday to us.

442
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:02,150
Happy birthday to us.

00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,910
For all the dragons.

451
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:31,070

Don't say that.

466

Me and my special dragoon.

474
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:43,210
I ain't dating a dog.

475
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:45,870
That didn't stop Brian Griffin.

476
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:50,490

Don't you- you who will be my next dog sitter.

481
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:10,730
That was a joke guys.

482
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:11,870
That's wrong.

483
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:19,610
When I meant date, I meant like, you know, with me and a dog.

484
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:25,410
You know, like guys, guys, guys, guys, me and the dogs.

00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,410
Guys, that's what I mean.

00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:50,670
Oh gosh, that was such a funny joke, guys.

493
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:57,330
I meant dog sitting.

494
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:04,190
Guys, you get the special opportunity to be my next dog sitter.

497
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:09,610

00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:19,770
Babe Goon.

505
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:22,670
Why don't we get back to my place?

506
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:23,950
Come on.

507
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,330
The Ferris wheel is about to end.

508
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:30,550
I know you- let me take you- don't tell Doki Bird, okay?

509
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,490
Don't tell her, okay?

510
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:34,990
I have this apartment under my name.

511
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:38,470
From all the money I- I stole from her.

512
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:40,790
Okay, so shh, don't tell her.

513
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:42,350
All right, come on.

514
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,610
Let's go- let's go to my place.

515
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,290
It's a great place.

516
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,160
Wow, isn't this lovely?

517
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,420
Rumor, don't tell Doki Bird.

518
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:04,220
She might be so be- she might still be renting, but at least I have my own place.

519
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,240
Look.

520
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,100
Um, you know...

521
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:15,560
All I'm saying is... I think you're special.

522
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,070
Sorry.

523
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:23,590
Sorry, I was coughing.

524
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:24,190
Sorry.

525
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:25,190
My coughs...

526
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,110
Sound like I'm laughing.

527
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:28,930
So like, I'm sorry.

528
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:32,870
If- if you think I'm laughing, I just- I just have this weird...

529
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:38,870
Rare cough, where every time I cough, I- I sound like I'm laughing, okay?

530
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:46,470
Oh my god, okay.

531
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,230
All right, don't worry.

532
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:47,530
I'm okay.

533
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:48,450
Don't worry, babe.

534
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:49,050
I'm okay.

535
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:01,110
Um, I just want to say...

536
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:02,730
Babe.

537
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:03,670
Baby.

538
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:04,870
Darling.

539
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:07,730
Um, sweetie.

540
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,510
Prince slash princess.

541
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:16,850
Sorry.

542
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:21,730
Lovely.

543
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:23,890
Um...

544
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:24,790
Oh, we don't say the L word.

545
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:25,790
This is a bit too soon.

546
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:29,510
You know, I- I can't- I- no, no, no, no, no, no.

547
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:29,890
Sorry.

548
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:32,450
Look, look, I- I'm afraid of commitment.

549
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:33,510
You know, that's why...

550
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:39,730
I- I- I have- look, I only have one red flag, and I'm afraid of commitment.

551
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:41,590
So like, I'm sorry.

552
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:45,290
There's no- no L word here, but like, honey.

553
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:46,970
Sweetheart.

554
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:48,510
Um...

555
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,370
Baby.

556
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:56,470
Um...

557
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:57,690
What else?

558
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:58,990
What else do people say?

559
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:00,210
What else do humans say?

560
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:02,010
Uh...

561
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:07,810
Uh...

562
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:08,850
Uh...

563
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:09,250
Boo.

564
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,270
Uh...

565
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,210
Bae.

566
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:13,290
Look.

567
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:18,410
I just want to tell you that...

568
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:23,110
I'm happy to spend...

569
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:25,370
my birthday with you.

570
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,050
You have been...

571
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:29,490
You, you, just you.

572
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:32,510
That singular dragoon that I'm talking to.

573
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:34,670
That one dragoon.

574
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:36,630
That- that's you right now.

575
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:37,710
That's right.

576
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:38,750
You right there.

577
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:43,530
You, I think I'm ready for the next step.

578
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:48,630
I think I'm ready for you to be my next dog sitter.

579
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,920
Will you...

580
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,240
take this rose...

581
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,260
and be my next dog sitter?

582
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,680
Sorry, sorry, I'm coughing.

583
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,100
Sorry,

584
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,290
should I get down on my knee too?

585
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,310
Give me a sec.

586
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:31,870
Would you do me the honor, babe...

587
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:35,950

588
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:44,350
Thank you for the magenta super.

Thank you, thank you.

Oh my god, I knew you'd say yes.

591
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:04,310
Of course, I mean...

592
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:07,910

593
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,330
these eyes?

594
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:16,850
Who could resist?

595
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:25,450
Oh my god.

596
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:26,630

Look, all right, so I'll schedule it.

00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:06,790

How about that, babe?

620
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:18,310
Is that perfect?

It's like our anniversary, too!

We get to- we get to be together for our anniversary!

623

That's- it's perfect!

624

Oh my god!

625
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:35,960
Babe, babe-a-goon, it's like- it's like fate naturally planned this for us.

626
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,250
Babe!

00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:43,830
Babe, boo!

No, don't worry, I'm gonna treat you right.

631
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:13,410

Sorry, sorry, sorry.

634
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:36,170
I'm being casted by a dog.

635
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:41,890
Baby, baby, baby, no, no, no, you know, you know I'll treat you right.

636
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:56,530
No, I would never use you for a free dinner.

637
00:41:56,910 --> 00:42:00,590
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

638
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:13,670
I would never, never, look, next year, February 14th, 2026, I'll treat you for dinner next time, okay?

639
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:13,890
Okay.

640
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:20,630
All right.

641
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:22,110
Come on.

642
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:26,750
I saw all of you guys said, uh, said I'm your real Oshi.

643
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:31,550
Come on, you know what they say, tough love.

644
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:38,710
Oh my god, I said it.

645
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:40,490
Oh my god,

646
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:47,950
I said it, don't worry.

647
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:50,010
Okay.

648
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,380
Maybe it is different.

649
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,680
Maybe it is different.

650
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:12,860
Babe, I told you, I told you it was different, you and I.

651
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,020
Yes, you.

652
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,420
I'm talking about you.

653
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:19,460
I'm talking about you.

654
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,580
Of course.

655
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,440
That's right.

656
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:25,780
Only you.

657
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:27,720
Nobody else.

658
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:31,320
If you know who you are, that's right.

659
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,560
It's you.

660
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:43,280
Look, we don't tell Jokeybird any of this, okay?

661
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:47,780
Just like last year, we don't tell her what happened, okay?

662
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:54,880
We, it's our own little secret, you and I.

663
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:58,980
We don't tell her what we did, okay guys?

664
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,020
She's still out there trying to plan whatever the fuck she's planning.

665
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:09,820
But this is our little secret.

666
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:13,920
I know you could keep it a secret, because we did it last year.

667
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,760
We can do it again.

668
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,340
So, why is it a secret?

669
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,000
Shh.

670
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,740
They won't understand.

671
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,760
It's more fun when it's a secret.

672
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:46,210
Oh, sorry.

673
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:47,190
Sorry.

674
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:48,330
God, that cough.

675
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:51,090
Oh my god.

676
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:54,730
Oh, it sucks to get sick on my birthday.

677
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:57,190
It really does, but...

678
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:02,830
It's more fun when it's a secret.

679
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,540
Sorry, sorry.

680
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,700
Let me try that again.

681
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:10,890
Let me, let me...

682
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:15,830
It's more fun when it's a secret.

683
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:23,190
All right, babe, don't worry.

684
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:25,850
Let's, let's head back home.

685
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:31,750
Jokey Bird might, Jokey Bird might, you know, might come back anytime.

686
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:40,210
All right, let's head back.

687
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:57,610
Okay, so...

688
00:45:57,610 --> 00:46:04,390
Um, look, I'm just not gonna sit up right now, because I don't know when she's coming back.

689
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:10,650
So like, uh, look, remember, remember we don't tell, we don't tell her what happened.

690
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:13,710
Remember that we're not gonna tell her.

691
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:20,360
So, so don't worry.

692
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,900
She doesn't know.

693
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:30,300
And she'll never know, right, Dragoons?

694
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:36,660
Yes!

695
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:54,190
Sorry, sorry, that, that took a real long time.

696
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:59,590
Sorry, I had like, some last minute plans, and um...

697
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:02,210
Oh my god, sorry guys.

698
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:02,570
I'm sorry.

699
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:19,130
I hope, I hope dad, dad hasn't been, you know, barking too much or uh, you know, being a little, being a little brat or anything or uh, uh, you know, just doing anything weird.

700
00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:20,770
I hope you're, you guys are okay.

701
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:22,110
Your dog is insane.

702
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:24,270
Oh, was he being like, you know, an asshole?

703
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:30,130
Was he like, chewing up some stuff and just like, you know, being a little bit of a bitch?

704
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:31,150
Is that it?

705
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:32,970
Yeah, that's, that's all right, guys.

706
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:36,130
Look, uh, look, you know, you know how he is.

707
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:41,170
He's just a little, he's just a little, he's just, he's just a little troublemaker, guys.

708
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:42,150
You know that.

709
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:44,790
Doki, dad is grooming the Dragoon.

710
00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:45,970
He's a dog.

711
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:47,710
How does, how can he do that?

712
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:49,910
Like what, is he just trying to get extra treats?

713
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:51,290
What a little rascal.

714
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:54,550
Uh, D-Dragon, thank you for this, uh, the super chat.

715
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:55,570
Thank you, thank you.

716
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:58,090
Uh, hey guys, thank you for the super chat.

717
00:47:58,170 --> 00:47:58,390
Thank you.

718
00:47:58,430 --> 00:47:58,930
Thank you.

719
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:01,950
Thank you for cringing through all of this, bro.

720
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:02,870
Thank you for the super chat.

721
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:03,210
Thank you.

722
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:03,930
Thank you.

723
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:04,930
Oh, man.

724
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:06,950
What a little troublemaker, guys.

725
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:08,010
Oh my god.

726
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:09,090
Oh, sorry.

727
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:23,530
The reason why it took so long for me, uh, to get back was, um, yeah, that little rapscallion right there is that, um, I bought him a little cake and I was waiting for it to defrost.

728
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:24,510
Oh my god.

729
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:26,490
Okay, I might be afk for a little bit.

730
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:30,650
Give me a sec because I want to show you guys the photo I took because it's really cute.

731
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:32,250
Uh, give me a sec.

732
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:34,870
Let me, let me show you guys the photo I took.

733
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:36,230
I also took a photo.

734
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,210
I also bought him some little treats too.

735
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:41,550
What a cute, what a, what a cute little guy.

736
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:46,810
Um, nothing, nothing is sinful about this dog.

737
00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:55,170
Oh my god.

738
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:59,050
Oh my god, nothing, nothing abnormal about him at all.

739
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:02,410
Let me give you guys, let me give you guys a little photo.

740
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:09,390
Um, so I got him a little, I got him a little birthday cake that I'm defrosting right now.

741
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:14,630
That's why it took me a really long time to, a long time to get back.

742
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:24,390
Um, so, uh, you know, I had, I hope you weren't too bored just, you know, sitting in the, sitting in the bar alone with dad.

743
00:49:24,850 --> 00:49:28,210
Um, and, uh, but look at this!

744
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:30,430
Look at this!

745
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:41,980
It's basically a dog, um, it's a dog friendly, uh, cake for him.

746
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:47,900
So I was, uh, defrosting that for him and that's why it took me a while to get back.

747
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,980
Uh, don't care, I think I have a gas leak.

748
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:53,240
I had the craziest uh, hallucination.

749
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:56,440
There, there was dad and a restaurant and a ferris wheel.

750
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:57,620
Oh my god.

751
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:59,080
Is, was there another gas leak?

752
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,840
Oh my god, it's just like last year.

753
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:09,660
You guys all said you, there was like a gas leak, uh, at the old place and you guys all had this weird hallucination of like dad being able to talk.

754
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,500
Silly, silly dragoons.

755
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:13,320
He's a fucking dog.

756
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,640
Dogs can't talk.

757
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,320
Devlin, thank you for the super chat.

758
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:16,840
Thank you.

759
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:17,540
Thank you.

760
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:22,880
Uh, You guys are so silly.

761
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,540
Like, oh my god, we gotta fix this gas leak.

762
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:28,360
I can't believe it happened twice in a row.

763
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:37,520
Guys are saying how like you're, you heard him talk and everything and I'm like, what do you mean?

764
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:38,940
He's a dog.

765
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:40,360
Dogs can't talk.

766
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,080
Um, just another gas leak year.

767
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:47,860
Uh, No one will believe.

768
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,680
I also bought him a little treat too.

769
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,360
So, look at this.

770
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:52,500
Look at that.

771
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,140
It's a little treat shape.

772
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:55,020
Like, look at that.

773
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:05,120
You think this, this little guy, this little guy, um, this little guy can do anything wrong?

774
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:13,940
I can't believe you guys would make such wild accusations about our little Doki Amber Doge.

775
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:16,020
I can't believe it.

776
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:27,420
He's so innocent and he's so innocent and cute.

777
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,540
Nothing, he'll do nothing bad.

778
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:34,860
Don't trust him.

779
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:37,140
He's like, where will he learn to gaslight?

780
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,160
I'm not a gaslighter.

781
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,900
I don't know where he gets that from, if he does.

782
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,480
He's so pure and, uh,

783
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,560
I swear, that was talking.

784
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:52,500
Why don't you believe me?

785
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:54,780
Oh, Sword, are you okay, Sword?

786
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:56,380
Sword, thank you for the super chat.

787
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:56,700
Thank you.

788
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:57,340
Thank you.

789
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:58,220
Are you okay?

790
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:00,980
Do you need to need to talk to anybody?

791
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:02,420
Are you guys okay?

792
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:06,960
It's just, I'm not, I'm sorry about, uh, I'm sorry about the another gas leak.

793
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:24,400
I might have to look into, like, this, this saloon real quick about, uh, you mean, I might need to talk to the bartender, Dragoon, if he knows anything about the, about any gas leak, uh, in the saloon, but it's actually weird that it happened twice, uh,

794
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:35,200
twice in a, in a row, uh, but like, uh, but like, hey, I hope you guys had a great time staying in just saloon for last hour.

795
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:38,520
Uh, and doing nothing else, right?

796
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:39,760
All right, guys.

797
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:40,160
Well,

798
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:51,980
Well, um, I guess it looks like, um, it looks like I have to go finish up the preparations.

799
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:54,740
So, uh, I'll be right back, everybody.

800
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:56,500
I'll be, I'll be right back real quick, guys.

801
00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:00,240
Um, looks like I have to finish some preparations real quick.

802
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:05,640
Um, just give me like, give me like, uh, five minutes, guys.

803
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:06,500
Give me five minutes.

804
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,660
Just gotta finish something up real quick.

805
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:09,340
I'll be back.

806
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:38,720
Sorry, um,

807
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:50,680
Sorry, I forgot to like, sorry, I might have said it too quiet, but what the fuck was that?

808
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:53,500
Huh?

809
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:54,860
What the fuck was that?

810
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,160
You didn't keep your cool.

811
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:57,500
I told you.

812
00:54:58,260 --> 00:54:59,480
It's our little secret.

813
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:03,340
Because remember, I own you.

814
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:05,630
I hope everything is okay over there, guys.

815
00:56:05,810 --> 00:56:07,630
I hope everything is okay.

816
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:10,670
Nothing weird's going on.

817
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:11,950
I don't know.

818
00:56:12,050 --> 00:56:14,090
I heard some noises back there.

819
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:19,790
I hope, I hope, I hope everything is okay, guys.

820
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:23,310
Nothing weird's going on back there.

821
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:25,750
Yeah?

822
00:56:26,690 --> 00:56:27,990
You guys all right?

823
00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:31,070
I think you guys are all right.

824
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:31,530
Don't worry.

825
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:32,850
I fixed it.

826
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:33,750
I fixed the issue.

827
00:56:34,170 --> 00:56:34,810
Hey, guys.

828
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:40,450
Anyway, I hope you guys had a great time, um, with dad.

829
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:43,190
Um, you know, hang out with dad today.

830
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:45,590
Uh, I was having a good, I'm sorry.

831
00:56:45,690 --> 00:57:08,250
I wish I could have spent more time with you and dad, but like, you know, we have a private, sorry, um, we sort of have a private party, and the invite list is like, um, it's very, uh, you know, it's very limited, and you know, I like, I let him pick who he wanted to invite and everything,

832
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:18,730
and I'm, I'm really sorry, Dragoons, but, um, he didn't pick you to join the party.

833
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:23,250
Um, so I, I told him, I tried to convince him.

834
00:57:23,330 --> 00:57:34,970
I like, gave him a list of names, and then like, and then it was like, you know, use your paw to like, pick the people you want, and like, it's really weird.

835
00:57:35,110 --> 00:57:51,410
He picked all the other dog sitters, but like, you know, um, for some reason, I think it was just, I think it, I mean, he's a dog, so like, I think he just doesn't know what the fuck he was doing, but I'm, I'm really, I'm really sorry, guys.

836
00:57:51,930 --> 00:58:02,630
Um, it's a very private event, and uh, your, your name just wasn't picked, but like, I'll try to convince him to invite you next time, okay?

837
00:58:02,910 --> 00:58:10,550
I swear to God, I'll try to convince him to pick your name from the, from the like, you know, the basket of names that I had.

838
00:58:10,810 --> 00:58:13,470
Uh, but like, yeah, it's not you.

839
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:15,350
I'm pretty sure it was an accident.

840
00:58:15,630 --> 00:58:16,830
I'm pretty sure.

841
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:19,490
I'm pretty sure it was an accident, guys.

842
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:25,470
I, I, I'm pretty sure, guys.

843
00:58:25,530 --> 00:58:26,750
Like, he's a dog.

844
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:28,310
Like, he doesn't know better.

845
00:58:28,730 --> 00:58:29,810
He doesn't know better.

846
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:40,830
Anyway, guys, um, I hope you guys have a great, had a great birthday, spending a great birthday with Doki Amber Doge, with dad.

847
00:58:41,330 --> 00:58:45,490
Um, I, uh, I hope you guys had a great time spending with him.

848
00:58:45,570 --> 00:58:47,050
I wish I was there.

849
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:53,510
I wish I was there spending it with you guys, but we had to go to our private party now.

850
00:58:53,770 --> 00:58:57,370
Um, it's sort of very exclusive, so I'm really sorry, guys.

851
00:58:58,570 --> 00:58:59,910
I'm really sorry.

852
00:59:00,450 --> 00:59:03,970
Um, but next time, next year, maybe you'll get the invite.

853
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:04,850
I promise you.

854
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:10,430
I promise you, next year, you will get the invite for sure this time.

855
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:17,690
I know last year I promised that too, but next year, next year, uh, you guys will get the invite.

856
00:59:17,790 --> 00:59:18,850
It's crazy.

857
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:22,470
You wouldn't believe who we booked for our musical guest.

858
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:24,170
Oh my god.

859
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:25,230
Oh my god.

860
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:27,530
And she's really pretty too.

861
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:36,710
You wouldn't believe it, but like, obviously, next year, you will have the opportunity, guys.

862
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:38,870
You'll have the opportunity next year.

863
00:59:39,050 --> 00:59:39,850
Don't worry.

864
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:45,970
All right, we're gonna go to our limousine now, but you'll be invited for sure this time, dragons.

865
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:51,990
I know I promised you guys last year, but like, but like, this time, it's not my fault.

866
00:59:52,070 --> 00:59:53,770
I'm not in charge of the invite list.

867
00:59:53,950 --> 00:59:55,310
I'm not in charge of it.

868
00:59:55,430 --> 01:00:00,390
Look, I'm sorry, but next year, next year, you'll definitely be invited, everybody.

869
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:01,630
All right, guys.

870
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:04,130
So, we're gonna go to our private party now.

871
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:07,910
As always, everybody, say hi, you're in it.

872
01:00:08,310 --> 01:00:08,930
Posture check.

873
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:11,450
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

874
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:17,330
And if you stayed up for Doki and Badoge and me, head to bed, because you deserve it.

875
01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:22,560
Hey guys, happy birthday day!

876
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:31,900
I'll show you guys photos of the, the exclusive party, um, later on Twitter and maybe on, uh, on the next stream, tomorrow's stream.

877
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:33,940
So, um, don't worry, guys.

878
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,500
So, it's not, it's like you didn't miss out.

879
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:38,720
I'll show you guys exclusive photos I take of the party.

880
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:41,040
So, it's like you didn't miss out, guys.

881
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:41,720
Don't worry.

882
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:43,980
All right, I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

883
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:46,960
Bye, guys.

884
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:47,920
Bye.

885
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:50,340
I'm sorry for making you guys wait for so long.

886
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,160
I'm really sorry.

887
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:56,440
Getting that cake was a fucking bitch, because there was so much traffic.

888
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:57,340
Hey, guys.

889
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:57,980
Bye, everyone.

890
01:00:57,980 --> 01:00:57,980
Bye.
