1
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,870
Hello, everyone.

2
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:54,090
I'm not okay, but, like, here we are.

3
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:07,870
Okay, so, if I knew... Alright, so we were just notified, like, like, five minutes before 9, 8, I'm not alive.

4
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:14,210
I'm technically, I'm the definition of alive, but inside, I can feel myself slowly.

5
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:15,870
Drifting away.

6
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:16,910
Whoa.

7
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,070
I'm not okay.

8
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,020
Damn.

9
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,500
So... Sorry, I just blew my nose.

10
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:34,700
Okay, so I have to go straight into it because... Alright, five minutes before...

11
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:49,230
Guys, I would love to do, like, our usual life update, but, like, five minutes before 9 a.m., we were given, like, I got notified, like, like, the order.

12
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,930
Of which this, um, early access was gonna go.

13
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,150
And, like, you know, I assume we're gonna...

14
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:01,290
We could take this on our own pace with seeing everything.

15
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:06,650
But I guess 30 minutes in the training area, I guess, before they shut it...

16
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,110
I don't fucking know how they shut it down, but...

17
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:12,270
I guess it's just... I mean, this is the internal build.

18
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,470
They can do whatever the fuck they want.

19
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:20,530
But I get 30 minutes of training area... practice range.

20
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:28,170
If I knew that it starts with an hour and a half of arenas, I would have started later.

21
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:31,690
Because I do not want to play arenas.

22
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,910
I...

23
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:35,630
I...

24
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:37,070
Personally...

25
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,470
Do not want to play arenas.

26
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,550
Because I was not a huge fan of arenas.

27
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,850
But maybe...

28
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,250
Maybe they made it...

29
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,330
They improved it since the last time arenas came to be.

30
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,990
Um...

31
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,790
So...

32
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:51,650
It's...

33
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,590
Like, an hour and a half of arenas.

34
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,290
And then we get Battle Royale at 11.

35
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,190
And I was thinking...

36
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,430
Oh my god.

37
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:04,110
I have to be strong enough to play until 11.

38
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,570
So I can try the Battle Royale vote.

39
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,130
I was like...

40
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,930
You can do it, Doki.

41
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,830
You are strong.

42
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,830
You can...

43
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,210
You can play.

44
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,390
You can stay up till...

45
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,190
Guys, I had three hours of sleep, for those who are wondering.

46
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,210
I...

47
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,150
What was I doing?

48
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,710
Um...

49
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:29,310
To...

50
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,830
To garnish three hours of sleep?

51
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,430
Well...

52
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,610
Well...

53
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:35,410
I...

54
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,210
Was actually practicing Apex!

55
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:42,610
Because I haven't touched Apex in a long time!

56
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:43,990
So...

57
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,110
I...

58
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,130
Thought it was such a good idea...

59
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,550
To practice Apex.

60
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,330
All right.

61
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,590
There's the new hero.

62
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:58,870
There he is.

63
00:04:59,070 --> 00:04:59,370
I'm sorry.

64
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,170
I know I should be like more...

65
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,170
Like, you know...

66
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:04,950
Whoa, guys!

67
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,010
Look at this!

68
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,750
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:07,190
I'm...

70
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:10,030
Obviously, it's nine in the morning right now for me.

71
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,370
So I'm not okay right now.

72
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:17,090
I...

73
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:18,090
Have...

74
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:18,390
Practice...

75
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:18,630
I...

76
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:18,890
Guys!

77
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:19,210
No!

78
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:19,730
Okay, cool.

79
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,490
Okay, that's pretty cool.

80
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,110
I'm a double jump.

81
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:22,090
Um...

82
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,050
You never learn, do you?

83
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:26,330
No.

84
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,190
Also, like...

85
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,170
Obviously, I had a convention today.

86
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,230
Okay, or yesterday, technically.

87
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:32,770
But, um...

88
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:33,350
My...

89
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,250
I had to do a convention in Australia.

90
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:36,970
Yesterday.

91
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,130
It was great.

92
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,270
I love doing conventions.

93
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,950
I love Mean Dragoons around the world.

94
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,270
But then, you know...

95
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,030
Obviously, the smart thing to do...

96
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:46,090
Was to sleep afterwards.

97
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:47,850
But instead...

98
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:48,590
Also, oh my gosh.

99
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,370
I have a double jump.

100
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,710
Oh, it's like the Ash ability.

101
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,850
But instead of going forward...

102
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:53,510
I go up.

103
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:53,910
Whoa!

104
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:55,590
Um...

105
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,250
I mean, that's nice movement-wise.

106
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,030
Uh...

107
00:05:59,030 --> 00:05:59,950
And...

108
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:00,190
Uh...

109
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,450
Double jump and...

110
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,370
Wall pounce.

111
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,530
Yeah, I heard about that.

112
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:04,890
Wait, how do I do that?

113
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,350
What the fuck?

114
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,490
Did I get wall pounce?

115
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:13,530
What?

116
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:14,430
Are you sure?

117
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:18,890
Are you...

118
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,570
Are you sure about that?

119
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,490
Oh, I see it.

120
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:23,530
I see the notification.

121
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,270
Oh, I see it.

122
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:27,770
You have to climb.

123
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,330
And then...

124
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,130
You...

125
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,050
You get your double...

126
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:31,710
Oh, okay.

127
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:32,470
Oh, okay.

128
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:32,910
That's...

129
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:33,410
That's cool.

130
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,710
It's this.

131
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,030
And then you jump on it.

132
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,950
And then you can have a double jump right here.

133
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,310
So, look.

134
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,670
I can reset it.

135
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:41,310
Wait, wait.

136
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:41,710
What?

137
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,670
Wait, I can reset it.

138
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,290
Okay.

139
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,130
Wait, did I just reset it?

140
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:47,830
Okay, wait.

141
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,810
Let me try this out.

142
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:51,470
Okay.

143
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:54,230
Okay, no.

144
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:54,750
Okay, no.

145
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:55,010
Okay.

146
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,690
I thought I could reset it, but it was because of this.

147
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,390
So, it's basically like...

148
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:01,550
Wait.

149
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,550
And then I jump.

150
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,690
And then...

151
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:05,850
Okay, wait.

152
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:06,670
Did I use it?

153
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:07,950
Oh, wait.

154
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:08,230
What?

155
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:08,850
Okay.

156
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,990
I could climb this wall forever if I wanted to, technically.

157
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:13,550
Yeah.

158
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,530
I could climb this wall forever if I wanted to.

159
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,230
I think I can.

160
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,330
And then...

161
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:22,930
Yeah.

162
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:23,710
And then...

163
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:23,810
Okay.

164
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:24,570
By the time...

165
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:24,710
Okay.

166
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:28,990
Technically, I can climb this wall forever if I wanted to.

167
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,470
So, we Genji now.

168
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:30,690
Yeah.

169
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:31,330
We Genji.

170
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:32,690
Uh...

171
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:32,990
But, okay.

172
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:33,650
Where was I?

173
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:34,590
So, like...

174
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:38,590
The smart decision right after doing convention is to head to bed.

175
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,390
But instead, I was like...

176
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,910
I should practice Apex.

177
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,870
Because it's been a while since I've played this game.

178
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,490
So, like, you know...

179
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:47,930
I should really, you know...

180
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,270
Know what the fuck I'm doing.

181
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,690
I should have read his abilities.

182
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:56,410
Give me a sec.

183
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:58,550
Um...

184
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,390
What are his details?

185
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:00,850
He has to double jump.

186
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,090
Press jump while in the air.

187
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:02,630
Jump again.

188
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,150
Press jump while climbing.

189
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,610
We'll launch Sparrow up the wall.

190
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,730
By the way, his name is Sparrow, for those who don't know.

191
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:09,210
Um...

192
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,110
My throat is warming up right now.

193
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:13,210
Hmm.

194
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:15,430
Uh...

195
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,510
Carry additional arrows and explosive arrows for the bow check.

196
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,250
Okay, so...

197
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,670
The bow check is on the ground now.

198
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:21,570
But...

199
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:22,430
For what?

200
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:23,010
Right?

201
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,390
Let me get my cough drops.

202
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:26,350
Um...

203
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,390
They changed how the bow check works.

204
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:31,530
So, I have no idea how they changed it.

205
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:32,690
But we'll see there.

206
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,910
So, the tracker dart...

207
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:37,890
I have, like, 15 minutes left of the training range before I get kicked out, I believe.

208
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,150
So, that's cool.

209
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:42,870
Oh...

210
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,570
So, I'm trying to...

211
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,990
I'm trying to get through this as much as I can.

212
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:48,490
Before...

213
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:49,810
Before they're, like...

214
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:50,330
Knock, knock!

215
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,570
It's arena time!

216
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:52,750
Um...

217
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,610
Shoot a tracker.

218
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:57,270
For a godlock that reveals enemies who walk within its line of sight.

219
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,410
These darts can be used to activate...

220
00:08:59,410 --> 00:08:59,710
Oh!

221
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:00,710
Oh, okay.

222
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,930
They can activate survey beacons.

223
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,630
Okay, so...

224
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,650
Oh, is he...

225
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:08,830
Is he Scottish?

226
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:11,990
Okay, so...

227
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,770
How does this work, technically?

228
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:15,650
How does this work?

229
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:16,830
Okay, so...

230
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:21,230
So, I guess I'll see whoever's there?

231
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:23,730
That enemy's being tagged.

232
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:24,810
Okay.

233
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:25,590
All right.

234
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:26,670
This really helped.

235
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,030
I already have, like...

236
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,110
I can see people.

237
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,830
Oh, he's Italian.

238
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:31,330
Okay.

239
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,070
I couldn't tell...

240
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,610
First off...

241
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,110
At first...

242
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:36,850
But, like...

243
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:37,730
Okay, he's Italian.

244
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:38,730
All right.

245
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,270
Yeah, his first...

246
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,030
The first thing he said sounded Scottish.

247
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,250
I was like, is he Scottish?

248
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,790
Okay, so...

249
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,050
That tracks them.

250
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,370
Oh, okay.

251
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,070
Now it sees two of...

252
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:52,550
Okay.

253
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,490
Okay, so he's, like...

254
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,550
Obviously, he's a scouter.

255
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,050
With the whole fucking name and everything.

256
00:09:58,770 --> 00:09:59,930
Oh, mama...

257
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:00,850
Mama mia.

258
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,430
Ba-da-ba-da-da.

259
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,490
Ba-ba-ba-ba-da-da.

260
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:05,910
Ba-ba-ba-da-da-da.

261
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,070
My mind is, like, full-on...

262
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,670
Oh, everywhere right now.

263
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:21,290
To the large arrow that will anchor where it lands after it charges up, it will shock anyone within its range, causing damage and slowing its enemies on hit.

264
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:21,890
Oh, my God.

265
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:22,710
I'm trying to...

266
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,590
I'm a mess right now.

267
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,030
I'm trying...

268
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,110
It's 9 in the morning.

269
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:29,870
Oh, my God.

270
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:32,130
I'm just trying to grab tissue to blow my nose.

271
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:32,510
Okay.

272
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:36,130
To the large arrow, causing damage and slowing any enemy.

273
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,190
Also, sound guy.

274
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,730
It's been a while since I've sound adjusted for Apex.

275
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,410
So, let me know if it's okay.

276
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:46,090
Because I don't know if I saved my volume for that.

277
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:46,810
All right.

278
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,330
Charging it up.

279
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,550
And then I'm going to hit him.

280
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,570
And then...

281
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,270
What the fuck?

282
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:55,930
Okay.

283
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:56,990
Whoa.

284
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:58,010
Okay.

285
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,050
How long is that?

286
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:02,110
Oh, that's not cool.

287
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:09,350
I definitely would not want to get hit by that.

288
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,250
I'm just like, wait.

289
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:16,930
That does not...

290
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:19,970
I mean, it's cool if you get that chance.

291
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:20,490
Okay.

292
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,500
If I hit this here...

293
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:23,510
Okay.

294
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,250
All right.

295
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:27,630
That's not...

296
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,750
That's not cool.

297
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,130
Okay.

298
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:35,110
All right.

299
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,330
All right.

300
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,630
That is like...

301
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,270
That seems strong.

302
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,790
Oh, the arrow can be destroyed if I hit somebody.

303
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,890
Can it be destroyed if I hit someone?

304
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,810
Oh, it's out of fire.

305
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:51,630
Okay.

306
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:52,590
Let's see.

307
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,350
I want to know if it goes through walls.

308
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:55,970
Let's see.

309
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:58,590
No, it doesn't.

310
00:11:58,830 --> 00:11:59,830
That's good to know.

311
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,590
It doesn't go through buildings.

312
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:03,950
All right.

313
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:05,590
Okay.

314
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:06,830
At least it can be destroyed.

315
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:07,470
You know?

316
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,130
It can be...

317
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:10,690
All right.

318
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:11,890
Imagine if it did...

319
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:12,650
Yeah, I was going to say.

320
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:15,170
If it actually went through walls, then we're cooked.

321
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,330
Wait a minute.

322
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:22,030
Wasn't that guy from inside the building?

323
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:23,670
Wait a minute.

324
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:24,590
Okay.

325
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:27,070
I need to double check if it does go through walls or not.

326
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,330
Because that guy was in the building.

327
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:32,710
All right.

328
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:36,270
Where is a man in the building so we can double check it?

329
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,210
Do we have any bots in buildings?

330
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:40,610
Okay.

331
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,210
Let's see.

332
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,290
We have any men in buildings, please.

333
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:47,270
All right.

334
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,530
I'll do it here and then see if it goes through this.

335
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:55,410
Okay.

336
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:55,730
Nice.

337
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:56,330
It doesn't.

338
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:56,590
All right.

339
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,050
That's cool.

340
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,670
It doesn't go through.

341
00:12:58,950 --> 00:12:59,250
Nice.

342
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,190
Yay.

343
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:01,870
Can it destroy doors?

344
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,790
Oh, that's a good question.

345
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,270
Let's try and find out if it does.

346
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:07,630
All right.

347
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:10,330
Yeah.

348
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:10,990
It needs...

349
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,490
I think it doesn't...

350
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,850
It really needs line of sight because, like...

351
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:17,110
I guess it can work.

352
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:25,890
If I shoot above it, if I shoot above it, I feel like if I shoot above this building, will it hit this guy over here?

353
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,230
Let's find out.

354
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:28,390
All right.

355
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,550
It needs line of sight.

356
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,410
All right.

357
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:58,090
All right.

358
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,970
Is it still on the ground?

359
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,050
Oh, it is.

360
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:02,550
So, yeah.

361
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:03,850
It's still on the ground.

362
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,070
So, we can... That's good.

363
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:06,630
Alright.

364
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,730
It doesn't stick to you.

365
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,010
So, uh...

366
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,830
It doesn't stick to you.

367
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:13,350
That's good.

368
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:16,530
Because if it didn't stick to you, it's like the OG Arc Star Strap.

369
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:22,170
Where you Arc Star yourself, and then your teammate Arc Stars you.

370
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,830
And then you run into the team.

371
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,990
Like, I was wondering if it's something like that.

372
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,410
But, like, not as broken.

373
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:28,150
Look, guys.

374
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,570
Not as broken.

375
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,470
It seemed a little scary at first.

376
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:36,330
But now that we tested it out, it's not as bad as I thought it'd be.

377
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,290
Um, this just needs...

378
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,210
If it can be broken...

379
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:45,070
The only issue is, like, I wonder how strong this is to break.

380
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,850
Is it like a rocket ult?

381
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,850
Where, like, it's easy to break?

382
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:52,250
Or is it, like, a Groot Wall?

383
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,130
Where I cannot fucking break that shit if I want...

384
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,550
If my entire family line tries to hit it.

385
00:14:58,210 --> 00:14:58,490
Like...

386
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,860
I just need to know that.

387
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,380
Um...

388
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,620
Alright, what other stuff?

389
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,200
Um...

390
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,540
It's...

391
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,660
Okay, so, like...

392
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,860
It's so awkward.

393
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,000
Because, like...

394
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,800
When I was, like, playing this game...

395
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,000
I was playing with, like...

396
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,280
When I was trying to practice Apex before the early access...

397
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,080
Okay, I have...

398
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,320
Sorry, I'll give you this...

399
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,600
I'll give you this conversation when I...

400
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,080
Before they kick me out of the...

401
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,840
The practice range.

402
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:32,520
Because...

403
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,480
I have, like, 10 minutes left of practice range.

404
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:34,780
Where the...

405
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,020
Where the fuck is the bow check?

406
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,960
Okay, there it is.

407
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:38,960
Alright, bow check.

408
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,720
Alright, so, for those who don't know...

409
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,260
Uh, Sparrow is OP'ing up.

410
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,700
Let's nerf Doctor Strange to the ground.

411
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:46,880
Psycho...

412
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,060
And the doctor...

413
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,960
And then the Marvel rival is gonna have a...

414
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,420
A fucking random patch note that comes open.

415
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,600
It was like...

416
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,840
Guys, looking at the current...

417
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,320
Uh...

418
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,120
Trajectory of other games...

419
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,300
We're gonna nerf...

420
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,320
A doctor's change.

421
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,680
Alright, for those who don't know...

422
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,420
Bow check...

423
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,480
Now comes with 50 arrows...

424
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,220
Right off the bat.

425
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,100
So...

426
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:07,700
You can't...

427
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,520
The only way to get more Bow check ammo...

428
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,060
Is you gotta pick up your arrows.

429
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,240
So it's like a Hawkeye situation.

430
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,820
Where you're wondering...

431
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,720
How does Hawkeye keep having arrows?

432
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:18,740
Um...

433
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,660
But what he does...

434
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,560
Is that after he kills somebody...

435
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,120
He goes over...

436
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,780
And picks up his arrows.

437
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,080
Oh, okay.

438
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:26,500
Yeah.

439
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,940
Yeah, and then he gets it back.

440
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,500
So...

441
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,780
So, like...

442
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,560
You can also pick up other people's Bow check arrows.

443
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:34,960
Um...

444
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,780
So...

445
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,440
You know...

446
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,800
Sorry, I missed that.

447
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,180
It's 9am, guys.

448
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,820
So you have to go over...

449
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,100
And be like...

450
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,260
Guys, I'm running out of arrows, guys.

451
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,660
And then you go and go...

452
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,900
And you pick it up.

453
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,120
Wait, where's my fucking...

454
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,180
Oh, it's cause I missed.

455
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,940
I don't know where my missed arrow is.

456
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:53,740
I...

457
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,400
What even misses?

458
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,040
Well, that arrow's gone.

459
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,360
I don't know where it left.

460
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,420
Cause it's like...

461
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:00,760
Look, see?

462
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,480
Every arrow...

463
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,100
Can this crash the server?

464
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,820
Imagine if like...

465
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,960
How many arrows does it take to crash the server?

466
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,480
Like, I'm curious.

467
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,780
Do they disappear?

468
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,380
Is it...

469
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,960
Like, wait a minute.

470
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,920
Wait, can I crash the server?

471
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:21,900
Like this?

472
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,280
How long does it take before they disappear?

473
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,500
How many arrows will it take?

474
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,240
And how many times do we have to miss to crash the server?

475
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,140
Oh...

476
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,160
Oh, God.

477
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,460
Only one way to find out.

478
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,640
I'm just wondering.

479
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,960
I'm just wondering.

480
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,840
If everybody had bow checks.

481
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,580
And we all just collectively shot our bow...

482
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:50,400
All 50 bullets of our bow check ammo.

483
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,920
Will it crash the server?

484
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,260
That's my...

485
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,200
That's a game theory.

486
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,540
I like to test out.

487
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,480
Like...

488
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,120
Alright.

489
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,720
What are my explosive arrows?

490
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:03,200
Alright.

491
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,240
How do I...

492
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,940
How do I use my...

493
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,020
Oh, I need a frag grenade for it.

494
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:08,320
Okay.

495
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,420
Plus, I wonder.

496
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,440
How do I use my explosive arrows?

497
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,720
Hey, where the fuck are frag grenades put in?

498
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:15,780
Okay.

499
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,100
I need to grab it here.

500
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:17,480
Maybe.

501
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,880
I don't know.

502
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:20,880
It's a...

503
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,420
It's a good thought to have.

504
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:23,520
Okay.

505
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,800
Gain an extra...

506
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:24,980
Alright.

507
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,800
How do I...

508
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:25,900
Okay.

509
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:26,360
B...

510
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,380
Oh, so it's like...

511
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,160
The sentinel.

512
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,780
It's basically like a sentinel.

513
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:30,500
Alright.

514
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,780
And then...

515
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,620
Oh.

516
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,180
Oh.

517
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:37,700
That's...

518
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,000
That's scary.

519
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,540
That's scary.

520
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,880
They're like...

521
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,200
Ha ha.

522
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,040
He missed.

523
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,580
And then it's like...

524
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,100
Did I...

525
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:49,600
I...

526
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,100
That's a little scary.

527
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,640
It's like mini ballistic right there.

528
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,140
Oh, dear.

529
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,340
Alright.

530
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,300
Oh, there you go.

531
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,660
Time to pick up my arrows.

532
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,120
Guys.

533
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,440
It's Hawkeye time.

534
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,460
Let me pick up my arrows.

535
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,600
Whoa.

536
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,480
Alright.

537
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:13,860
Nice.

538
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,380
Um...

539
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:15,980
No, I don't.

540
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:16,360
I...

541
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,980
I went back and picked it up.

542
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,280
Can you...

543
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:19,920
Oh, yeah.

544
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:20,880
Can I super...

545
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,840
That's a good question.

546
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,080
Can you super jump with a...

547
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:24,680
You know what?

548
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,220
You're right.

549
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,980
There's no dumb...

550
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:27,600
Dumb questions.

551
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,800
I can hurt myself.

552
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:32,960
Ha ha ha.

553
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,720
Ha ha ha.

554
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:35,640
Alright.

555
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,680
I can hurt myself, guys.

556
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:39,820
Um...

557
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,700
Oh, there you go.

558
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:40,920
See?

559
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,220
Look at that.

560
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:42,700
Goodbye.

561
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:43,620
Ha ha ha.

562
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,200
Wait.

563
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,400
That's not even 30 minutes.

564
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,860
What do you mean?

565
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,360
What do you mean?

566
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,180
That wasn't even 30 minutes.

567
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,040
I should have three minutes.

568
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:00,690
Alright, guys.

569
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:01,930
Guys.

570
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:02,790
Knock...

571
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:03,130
Okay.

572
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,270
What was I talking about?

573
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:04,570
Okay.

574
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:08,170
I can stall a little bit before I have to do arenas.

575
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,230
It's...

576
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,070
Ha ha ha.

577
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:14,350
Alright.

578
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,330
What was I talking about before I was like...

579
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:16,870
Wait, guys.

580
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,810
Let me, like, try out the bow shape before they kick me out.

581
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:20,930
Um...

582
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:21,550
Ha ha ha.

583
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:23,410
Okay.

584
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:24,810
What was I...

585
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,490
What was I talking about?

586
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,750
What did I want to talk about before...

587
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,070
Before, like...

588
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,370
I was like, guys, wait a minute.

589
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,010
I gotta...

590
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,990
I gotta try this out before...

591
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:35,550
Oh, yeah.

592
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,030
Um...

593
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:37,490
Oh, my God.

594
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:38,730
What was that topic that I...

595
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:39,090
Oh, yeah.

596
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,030
Uh...

597
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,990
I was playing with a friend a bit.

598
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:43,390
Uh...

599
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:43,870
I don't know.

600
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:45,230
Like...

601
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,890
To practice Apex.

602
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:47,950
Um...

603
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:48,650
Before I went...

604
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,170
Before I had my three hours sleep.

605
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:51,530
Um...

606
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:53,110
And...

607
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,610
I was, like...

608
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:55,210
Getting these, like...

609
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,410
You know those error codes?

610
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,790
And stuff on your...

611
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,090
When...

612
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,070
If you don't, uh...

613
00:20:59,070 --> 00:20:59,310
Get...

614
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,070
If you don't, like, get into the server correctly...

615
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:05,070
Here's these error codes that show up...

616
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:07,550
On your top right.

617
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,130
And then, like...

618
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:09,530
I...

619
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:10,370
For the life of me...

620
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:13,250
I could not remember any Apex terminology.

621
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:15,230
I just was, like...

622
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:15,670
I see...

623
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,250
I see symbols everywhere.

624
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:18,850
And I was just, like...

625
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,090
I don't know what these symbols mean anymore.

626
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:23,850
My brain is just Marvel rivals.

627
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,950
I forgot every...

628
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:26,270
Oh, my...

629
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:26,770
I was, like...

630
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:29,190
I don't remember these Apex terms.

631
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:30,350
The Apex lag.

632
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:31,630
And they're, like...

633
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:32,790
And then my friend was, like...

634
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:33,650
Oh, hey...

635
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:34,170
They're, like...

636
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:34,610
Blah, blah...

637
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:35,610
They're, like...

638
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:36,710
Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

639
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:37,150
And I was, like...

640
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:39,090
There's an Apex word for this.

641
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,650
Oh my god, what was it?

642
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,490
I don't remember.

643
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,650
And then at one point, I was like...

644
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:51,190
At one point, I was like, let's go to the point, guys.

645
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,090
And my friend was like, point?

646
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:59,010
I was like, sorry, zone, guys.

647
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:00,410
Let's go to the zone.

648
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:05,030
I was like, it's been too long.

649
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:08,490
She forgot her roots.

650
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:16,670
But guys, it's killing me right now.

651
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,670
What was it called when...

652
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:24,470
What is it called when you...

653
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:25,310
Oh my god, okay.

654
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:26,650
Encore, nice.

655
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:32,730
What is it called when you don't sync up to the Apex server correctly?

656
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,870
And you start lagging.

657
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,830
But it's not the internet.

658
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:41,810
I swear to god, I remember that word.

659
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:42,870
Packet loss!

660
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,530
Oh my god, thank you, Alan!

661
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,530
I was like, going crazy.

662
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:51,410
I was like, what the fuck was that word called?

663
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:52,990
I was having packet loss.

664
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:55,350
And I was like, I was so...

665
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,330
Like, it was so bad.

666
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,370
Like, and I like...

667
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:59,970
I was... I had to quit my game and log back in.

668
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:01,030
I was still getting packet loss.

669
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,650
And I was like, frustrated as hell.

670
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:05,390
And I was trying to tell my friend that I was like...

671
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,370
Oh my god, there's so many symbols.

672
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,190
And there's something happening to my...

673
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:11,890
To my... I didn't sync up to the server right now.

674
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,290
But I don't know what it's called.

675
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,870
And it's fucking killing me.

676
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:18,010
And then my friend gave zero good answers.

677
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:20,310
And I was like, no!

678
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:21,350
You're not...

679
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,510
Because I was like, you're not Apex enough.

680
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,490
You don't understand.

681
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:26,190
There's a special word for this.

682
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:27,390
There is...

683
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:30,650
There is...

684
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,430
No, it's a special Apex term.

685
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:34,890
Because it happens a lot to Apex people.

686
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:36,890
It's...

687
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:38,950
It's a mostly Apex term.

688
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,470
Because this game...

689
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:44,350
Because it happens a lot to Apex players.

690
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:45,250
So...

691
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:47,250
So I have to...

692
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:48,430
Like...

693
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,530
So it's...

694
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:49,950
Because...

695
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:52,910
I don't have to say Packet Loss in Marvel Rivals.

696
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,270
I don't have to say Packet Loss in Overwatch.

697
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,770
It happens a lot in Apex though.

698
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:59,810
So I remember saying a lot in Apex.

699
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,090
I...

700
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:04,730
Okay.

701
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:09,270
It's one of the Apex specials.

702
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,850
So I was just like, what was that word called?

703
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:12,210
Oh...

704
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,570
Therefore, it is an Apex term.

705
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,230
Exactly.

706
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:17,670
Alright, guys.

707
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,210
It's time to play.

708
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:22,170
Who will get Sparrow in arenas?

709
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:23,730
Alright.

710
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,790
It's unlike...

711
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:30,210
Can Doki survive an hour and a half of arenas?

712
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,050
Can she...

713
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:34,730
Can she make it out of arenas?

714
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:36,830
Oh, I missed the first queue.

715
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:38,170
God damn it!

716
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,010
I talk...

717
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:40,910
I should have queued up right after.

718
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:41,630
Why did I?

719
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:42,350
No!

720
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,290
Everyone is already in game.

721
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:46,250
I...

722
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,710
I missed...

723
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:52,010
I missed the first arena queue.

724
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:53,330
No!

725
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,110
Alright, guys.

726
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,250
I guess I should have...

727
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:01,050
I should have queued up before I went in arenas.

728
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:02,670
I really should have.

729
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:03,550
I just...

730
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,490
I didn't know.

731
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:05,070
I...

732
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,610
I didn't know.

733
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,530
Oh, you're right, guys.

734
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:13,570
How long is the arenas, by the way?

735
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,230
Well, yeah, I think it is.

736
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:18,070
Guys, I don't even know.

737
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,270
Oh, it's me and...

738
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:20,610
Me and one other...

739
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:23,390
These other two players also took too long.

740
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,210
Let's go!

741
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:24,430
Oh!

742
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:26,930
Um...

743
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:30,310
Oh, my God.

744
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:32,910
I didn't realize I missed the first fucking queue.

745
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,550
I had to...

746
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:38,870
I had to talk about packet loss, guys.

747
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:40,190
I had to.

748
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:42,030
At least I'm not alone.

749
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:43,070
Oh, nice.

750
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:43,630
There we go.

751
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:48,990
Alright, it's time to play...

752
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,450
Who will get...

753
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,670
Who will get Sparrow first?

754
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:53,510
Yippee!

755
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:57,870
Alright, who's first choice?

756
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:00,390
God!

757
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:01,910
I'm last?!

758
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:03,050
Okay.

759
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:06,650
Oh, no one wants to play Sparrow?

760
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,310
I mean...

761
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:08,870
Fuck, okay.

762
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,930
I guess I'll take...

763
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:13,750
I guess it's like...

764
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,610
Cause, like, Sparrow's not that great in Arena.

765
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:17,650
So, like, it makes sense.

766
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,110
But, like, also, I...

767
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,150
Whatever.

768
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:23,730
Is he...

769
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:24,190
Bad?

770
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,850
I'm just like...

771
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:30,890
I'm just like...

772
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,310
No one wants to play Sparrow?

773
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:35,410
Okay.

774
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:37,450
Maybe that's a...

775
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:37,830
Wait!

776
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,710
No one's playing Sparrow!

777
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:40,530
Wait!

778
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:42,550
I...

779
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,630
I don't know!

780
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:44,970
You know what?

781
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:45,690
Let's go.

782
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:47,370
Let's buy that bow check.

783
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:48,370
I...

784
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:49,330
I was like...

785
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:51,350
Why is no one playing Sparrow?

786
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,390
I don't understand!

787
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:55,590
Do I need anything else?

788
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:56,190
Nah.

789
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:57,230
I don't.

790
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,790
I don't need anything else.

791
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:00,730
Honestly.

792
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,170
Okay.

793
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:05,430
Maybe I should not have put my grenade right off the back.

794
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,750
Oh, that was an accident!

795
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:10,870
Alright.

796
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:11,970
I bought a grenade.

797
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,130
I accidentally grenaded my bow check.

798
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,390
That was a fucking accident.

799
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:17,510
Alright.

800
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:19,330
That was a fucking accident.

801
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:19,530
That was very good.

802
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:20,250
Okay.

803
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:21,090
Where are they?

804
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,770
That was a fucking accident.

805
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:24,170
Whoops.

806
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:25,260
The buttons are fucked, but...

807
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:26,350
Figure this out.

808
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:28,890
Okay.

809
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:30,910
Stupid ballistic.

810
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,040
Oh, man.

811
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:38,740
Oh!

812
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,840
Oh, 158 on one!

813
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:40,440
Oh!

814
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,320
Oh!

815
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:41,460
Oh,

816
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:45,980
shit!

817
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,340
He's going in!

818
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,280
He's going in!

819
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:54,110
Oh, he's looking at me!

820
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:55,050
Alright.

821
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:57,270
That is...

822
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:57,950
Let's go!

823
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:00,010
Yeah!

824
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,090
I hit two shots!

825
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:05,470
I did it!

826
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:07,690
Is this fair?

827
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:11,810
I have like two technically who were Pred players before.

828
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:14,890
Is this fair?

829
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,070
Wait, do I automatically... Okay.

830
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:20,690
I don't care.

831
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:21,250
I don't know.

832
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:22,750
Just get that R9 in there.

833
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:27,110
And then... Wait, can I not?

834
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:28,570
Previously purchased?

835
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:29,930
Wait, what?

836
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:38,950
I cannot use my... I can't use my... Is arenas not balanced?

837
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:39,890
No way!

838
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,210
Oh my god.

839
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:48,210
I can't buy two... Wait, but... Yeah, I can't buy two in a row.

840
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:49,630
Which I've noticed.

841
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:50,050
Yeah.

842
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,290
I'll just run... I guess I'll run R9.

843
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:55,490
No, I get... No, it's like you can't do it twice in a row.

844
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:57,430
Which is dumb?

845
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,330
Is that dumb?

846
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:02,910
Okay.

847
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:06,450
Okay.

848
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:09,970
All right.

849
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:11,090
I'm running up.

850
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:12,990
Where are they?

851
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,530
What the fuck?

852
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:17,910
Okay.

853
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:22,410
All right.

854
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:25,050
This is not fair.

855
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:25,050
What the fuck?

856
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:25,190
Shit.

857
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:29,910
Is it lagging for you guys a little bit?

858
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:31,290
Like you're talking...

859
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:34,990
Okay.

860
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:35,470
Okay.

861
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:36,750
Oh, I can.

862
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,070
If I... What?

863
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:38,850
Okay.

864
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:41,370
Every... Every gun is... All right.

865
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:42,370
You know what this means?

866
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,630
Wait, did they nerf Akimbo?

867
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:44,390
Let's find out.

868
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,670
Let's find out.

869
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,170
We'll find out.

870
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:49,890
Okay.

871
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:53,110
If they did, I'm gonna... Grab... I don't know.

872
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:54,270
I guess the Havoc.

873
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:56,590
No, actually.

874
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,170
Don't waste my money on two guns.

875
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,230
We don't need it.

876
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:01,390
I'll... We don't need it.

877
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:02,730
You know what?

878
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:03,350
Fuck it.

879
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:03,910
Let's go.

880
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:05,690
Let's ult.

881
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:06,810
All right.

882
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:08,150
Nah.

883
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:09,870
All right.

884
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:10,870
Let's try it.

885
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,210
Are they gonna do the same thing?

886
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:14,110
Yes, they are.

887
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:16,350
Whoops.

888
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:18,810
That's not what I want to do, but that's fine.

889
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,290
We'll find out if they're still there.

890
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:22,890
There we go.

891
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,010
They didn't nerf that gun.

892
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:30,730
They didn't nerf that gun.

893
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,510
They did not nerf it.

894
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,190
I was like... You know what?

895
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:39,590
I don't even... There we go.

896
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,320
Oh.

897
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:45,380
Hey.

898
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,320
Hey.

899
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:48,400
Hey.

900
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:48,660
Wait, what?

901
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,520
There we go.

902
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:52,780
There we go.

903
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,680
Hey, did these guys?

904
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,480
Guys.

905
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,520
I don't think my lobby... I don't think my team was fair.

906
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,940
I don't know who the fuck was on the other team, but they...

907
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:13,000
That's definitely a full three stack of, like, people who have hit Fred before.

908
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,100
Versus...

909
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:20,240
Versus... Who the fuck was... Yeah, I'm sorry.

910
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,820
DJ Sneaky Snake.

911
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,020
I... Sorry, buddy.

912
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,480
Yeah, that's awkward.

913
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:35,400
I don't mean... This is a full hydrogen bomb situation.

914
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:40,840
Yeah, the DJ Sneaky Snake and... Yeah, all these guys.

915
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:41,980
Sorry, buddy.

916
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,400
Definitely not... Not a fair game.

917
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,580
I was like... Oh, shit.

918
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,420
This is... My team's pretty decent.

919
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,060
I recognize these people.

920
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:56,460
And then... I just wanted to have a fun time.

921
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:01,740
Leave DJ alone till he's already dead.

922
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,580
Don't worry.

923
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,460
That's gonna be me on the enemy team.

924
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,400
I'm gonna fucking go against, like, um... Don't worry.

925
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:20,560
I'm gonna be put into, like, that exact situation very soon, guys.

926
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,560
I... I feel... I feel it.

927
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:26,260
I'm gonna get DJ Sneaky Snake on my team.

928
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:26,940
Oh, wait.

929
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:27,200
No.

930
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:27,520
Okay.

931
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,620
I got a caution again.

932
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:30,620
Uh...

933
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:30,980
Okay.

934
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,840
Not exactly the exact same situation.

935
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,280
Uh...

936
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:39,100
We don't... We don't have DJ Sneaky Snake, unfortunately.

937
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,440
You know, I'm gonna try...

938
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,180
I don't know how I feel.

939
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,560
I'm just playing Sparrow.

940
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,520
I'm just playing Sparrow just for the sake of...

941
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,000
The fact that I can play Sparrow.

942
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,180
Mmm.

943
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,340
I don't know who Maiden is, though.

944
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,420
I mean, that's good.

945
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,740
At least it could be less of a Hydrogen Bomb.

946
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:58,760
Hello.

947
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:00,620
Mmm.

948
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,140
Hello, how you doing?

949
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,120
I'm doing good as LAN.

950
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,280
Alright.

951
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:06,900
It's fun.

952
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:07,840
It's so fun.

953
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,100
Wait, can people at LAN try it out, too?

954
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,180
I'm really glad that you're having fun.

955
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:12,840
Hi, Doki.

956
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:13,220
Thank you.

957
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,520
Okay, let's see.

958
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,840
I don't know who these people are.

959
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,200
Like, on the end.

960
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:18,980
I...

961
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,100
Am I just out of touch?

962
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,160
Am I...

963
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,500
Am I...

964
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:24,900
No.

965
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,260
Probably.

966
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,760
Am I out of touch, guys?

967
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,120
I don't know.

968
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,500
The only person I recognize is Caution.

969
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:37,940
Because he's been in the Apex team for so fucking long.

970
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,420
No, it's the kids.

971
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:39,980
Yeah.

972
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,080
I went wrong.

973
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,460
Let me go.

974
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,760
Yeah, dude.

975
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,460
I'm just like...

976
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:52,120
I don't recognize these names other than one person.

977
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:53,860
Alright.

978
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,140
Are they gonna go here again?

979
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,400
I swear to god.

980
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,020
Where are they gonna go?

981
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,780
No, they're over here.

982
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,940
I've got an opponent inside.

983
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:04,840
Step 5.

984
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:05,880
Setting a tracker.

985
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:06,400
Okay.

986
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,560
I have 50 bullets.

987
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,100
It's fine.

988
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,140
I have 50 bullets.

989
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:16,440
It's fine.

990
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:16,900
It's fine.

991
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,180
I know I should take high ground, but like, I'm bored.

992
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,600
Okay.

993
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,000
I'm gonna...

994
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,400
G this.

995
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:26,800
Oh.

996
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:28,880
What?

997
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:29,840
Oh my god!

998
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:30,380
Get back!

999
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:30,920
Oh!

1000
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,200
Sorry, I...

1001
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,480
I forgot my keybinds.

1002
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:40,700
I forgot my keybinds, so I was like, freaking out.

1003
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,080
Where's my...

1004
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,480
I see them to my left.

1005
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,840
I see them trying to get across.

1006
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,740
So I was like...

1007
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,980
See them trying...

1008
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:56,520
What?

1009
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,400
Okay.

1010
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,640
They're actual players.

1011
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,560
Oh no, this is bad.

1012
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,580
For me.

1013
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,140
Oh my god.

1014
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,020
This is bad for me.

1015
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:14,980
Are you playing on...

1016
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,780
Oh, my god.

1017
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,020
Oh, voice cut out.

1018
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:18,300
What was it?

1019
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,800
OH MY WATCH!

1020
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,900
Yes, I'm done last!

1021
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:22,600
Did you hear me now?

1022
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,660
Alright, back to my roots.

1023
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,860
Back to my roots.

1024
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,180
Okay, let's see.

1025
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,380
Yeah, I am.

1026
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,200
Alright.

1027
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,000
Baiting and...

1028
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,280
Baiting!

1029
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,660
I was looking at her cross!

1030
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,460
There's someone to my left side!

1031
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:47,400
I don't know how to press Q for this.

1032
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,580
The tracker thing is so weird.

1033
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,800
Maybe I'm just aiming it incorrectly.

1034
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,920
Who are we fighting?

1035
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,220
Like, I don't know.

1036
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,380
It's Crusade.

1037
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,280
I guess they're running as a team.

1038
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,600
I guess that would make sense, right?

1039
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,500
Jesus.

1040
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,940
Okay, I hate this.

1041
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,520
I hate this.

1042
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,920
That they're so...

1043
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,140
Missile locked!

1044
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:11,540
Okay.

1045
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,140
Not anymore.

1046
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,060
Oh, there is a little lag.

1047
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:16,760
I see it now.

1048
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,240
Oh, wait.

1049
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,280
Why am I on EU server?

1050
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:20,640
Wait.

1051
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:21,620
No, okay.

1052
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,500
It's not EU server.

1053
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,120
I think it's just like...

1054
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,460
Just unfortunate.

1055
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,780
Alright, I'm gonna take this 1v1 and lose.

1056
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,460
Okay.

1057
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:32,600
Okay.

1058
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,380
He ulted that.

1059
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,800
But I couldn't...

1060
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,760
Oh, it's 2 down?

1061
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,140
Okay.

1062
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,620
I believe her.

1063
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,700
Alright, nice.

1064
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:45,360
Yay!

1065
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,480
Yippee!

1066
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,720
I have 145 ping!

1067
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:50,580
God!

1068
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,940
I was like, wait a minute.

1069
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,740
I see it now.

1070
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,780
Alright, you know what would be great at 140?

1071
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,420
No, I shouldn't risk that.

1072
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,580
I was like, you know what would be amazing at that ping?

1073
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:05,440
Alright.

1074
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,480
Let's see.

1075
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,220
Havoc time.

1076
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,320
I have more money.

1077
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,200
Yeah, let's just put it all on Havoc.

1078
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,800
You know, fuck this.

1079
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,200
If they're...

1080
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,500
No, I can't snipe on that ping.

1081
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:16,960
Alright.

1082
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,320
I was gonna be like, fuck it.

1083
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,640
Let's bring out the sniper.

1084
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,360
I was like, wait, no.

1085
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,460
This ping fucking sucks.

1086
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,020
Alright.

1087
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,740
I can't do that on that ping.

1088
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,660
I'm gonna try.

1089
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,340
I'll try it out one time.

1090
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,140
Jesus.

1091
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,620
I'm so bad at the tracker.

1092
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,780
I've missed every time.

1093
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:38,600
This is sick.

1094
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,460
God damn it.

1095
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,980
I see them.

1096
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,260
I see them over here.

1097
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:50,720
Jesus.

1098
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,340
I cracked one of them.

1099
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,140
Okay, maybe one gun was not it.

1100
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:04,780
UGHHAHAHAHAHA!

1101
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:05,200
Yes!

1102
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:10,700
One gun might not be the best idea that I could do... in my life.

1103
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,300
Oh my god.

1104
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,440
What the fuck was shooting was?

1105
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,720
There we go.

1106
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:17,560
Yeah.

1107
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,420
Let me...

1108
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,820
I should not use one gun.

1109
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,340
But you know what I'm going to do?

1110
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,640
I'm going to keep using one gun.

1111
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,340
I won't learn.

1112
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,200
I won't learn from my mistakes.

1113
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,860
I'll still do it.

1114
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,720
One gun, I don't know why.

1115
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,100
Okay, wait, but we win this.

1116
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,200
It'll be fine.

1117
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,640
So might as well bring this in too.

1118
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,560
Might as well.

1119
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,220
Let's go.

1120
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,980
I can be your sniper or your close range.

1121
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,500
Oh, wait.

1122
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,040
There's no consequences.

1123
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,200
Let me grab my ult too.

1124
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:56,600
You know what?

1125
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,060
Fuck it.

1126
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,080
Let's just grab everything.

1127
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:03,180
Alright, where are they heading to?

1128
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,280
Jesus Christ.

1129
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,160
I hate the scope on this though.

1130
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,120
Jesus, I can tell the lag.

1131
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,080
Me don't like you.

1132
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,200
You know, like this lag.

1133
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:29,710
Oh no, maybe this might be dumb.

1134
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:36,390
There we go.

1135
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:41,370
There we go.

1136
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:44,530
Where's the last guy?

1137
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:48,190
Okay.

1138
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:49,610
I may as well pull a heel.

1139
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:51,530
It's fine.

1140
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:55,690
Oh, hey.

1141
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:59,550
Oh, we just got this, right?

1142
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:00,650
Yeah, I was gonna say.

1143
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:03,290
Yeah, there we go.

1144
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:04,150
Nice meeting you.

1145
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:05,390
There we go.

1146
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:05,750
There we go.

1147
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,550
I got it.

1148
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:08,310
See guys?

1149
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,150
Who said I'm washed?

1150
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:11,450
Look at that.

1151
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:15,850
I just can't snipe with this ping.

1152
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:24,330
We ignored like the 10 seconds of whiffing on the longbow.

1153
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:26,450
But like, come on.

1154
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:28,730
I did my job.

1155
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:30,710
I did my job.

1156
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:34,530
I did what I can.

1157
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:37,230
Streamer, like, try again.

1158
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:39,370
I don't know who she is now.

1159
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:41,130
Oh, what's the watermark?

1160
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:45,250
It's so that, like, you know, if people somehow leak stuff, they'll tell you.

1161
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:47,090
It's just to prevent leakers.

1162
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:49,870
Because it'll tell you, like, who it was that leaked.

1163
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:52,150
Because this is early access and stuff like that.

1164
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:55,290
So, it's to prevent leaking.

1165
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,370
Or this.

1166
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:59,410
Jesus, I wish it was like an hour.

1167
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:02,610
Give me Battle Royale!

1168
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:09,970
Give me Battle Royale!

1169
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:13,730
I don't want to play arenas.

1170
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:16,770
I want a Battle Royale!

1171
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:22,090
Give me, give me!

1172
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:25,410
Let me in!

1173
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:27,030
Let me in!

1174
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:31,210
I'm tired of arenas already!

1175
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:32,010
Yeah.

1176
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:37,030
But we love arenas.

1177
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,890
I was never...

1178
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:39,870
And I'm going to say it.

1179
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:40,630
I was...

1180
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:41,270
Okay.

1181
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:42,850
As long...

1182
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:45,650
It would be funny if we fight against Caution now.

1183
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:46,710
But, like...

1184
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:49,930
I was never a fan of...

1185
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:53,290
I was personally not a huge fan of arenas.

1186
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:58,530
Because arenas had so many exploiters, um...

1187
00:41:58,530 --> 00:41:58,850
Playing.

1188
00:41:59,230 --> 00:41:59,890
So, like...

1189
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:01,970
I didn't like arenas because of it.

1190
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:03,950
There was a lot of hackers in arenas, too.

1191
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:07,070
There was a lot of exploiters and hackers in arenas.

1192
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:09,010
So, I never liked arenas because of it.

1193
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:11,850
Because it was so easy to hack a pair...

1194
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:15,450
Like, it was so easy to hack in arenas and not get caught.

1195
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:18,150
Because it was so fast compared to Battle Royale.

1196
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:25,030
I know, like, because I knew a friend who granted Arena Pred, and they were saying it was, like, very... Oh, I knew it.

1197
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,190
I fucking knew it.

1198
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,690
I knew it.

1199
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:29,010
Caution would be there.

1200
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:30,430
Oh, my God.

1201
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:31,370
I knew it.

1202
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,310
He's just gonna run in.

1203
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:36,890
He's just gonna rush in.

1204
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:38,990
I know it.

1205
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:40,390
I know that's what he's gonna do.

1206
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:42,210
I'm gonna just buy... Actually, no.

1207
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:46,030
I don't wanna buy a naked R9 if he's just gonna fucking run in.

1208
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:50,870
I'll just get Nemesis.

1209
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:51,350
Fuck.

1210
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:51,770
Ah.

1211
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:55,110
Ah.

1212
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:55,510
Nemesis.

1213
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:56,430
Fuck it.

1214
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:57,310
Let's just get Nemesis.

1215
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:00,370
I'm gonna... He's just gonna run straight in.

1216
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:06,130
I don't know what my team's skill is, but Caution is, like, really... Caution's been playing this game since, like, launch.

1217
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:10,330
So... And he's been high ranked since launch, so I'm, like, a little...

1218
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:16,140
I'm a little hesitant on fighting him.

1219
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,600
Because I know...

1220
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,600
Skill-wise, he is better than me skill-wise.

1221
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,640
I have no question asked.

1222
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,560
He's been around for a while, so...

1223
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:31,560
So I know skill-wise he is better than me, and that's, like...

1224
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,160
What the fuck?

1225
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:36,500
Oh, my God.

1226
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:37,560
He can track me?

1227
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,400
I don't know where exactly he is, so...

1228
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,220
Gotta be careful right now.

1229
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:58,700
Okay.

1230
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:00,360
Okay, you got some defense.

1231
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:03,380
Oh, my God.

1232
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,400
I only have...

1233
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,000
An enemy's here.

1234
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:08,600
Idiot.

1235
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:09,660
Fire on here.

1236
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:15,480
No!

1237
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,560
I didn't realize I had a second gun!

1238
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:18,920
That's unlucky.

1239
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:20,980
I knew you'd be dead.

1240
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:22,960
I didn't realize I had a second gun.

1241
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:24,420
I forgot it gave me an...

1242
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,700
If I knew I had a Mozam, I would have ran in with my Mozam.

1243
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:29,140
I found out that late.

1244
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,560
I found out late that I had a Mozam.

1245
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:34,220
Yeah.

1246
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:34,920
Alright.

1247
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:35,460
That's interesting.

1248
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,000
Yeah, I forgot.

1249
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,660
That's how little I play.

1250
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:40,000
I told you, that's how little I play.

1251
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,760
Okay, now that I have...

1252
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:45,520
Now that I have, like, enough money, I'll naturally use this.

1253
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:49,360
Yeah, I mean, he ran in a straight line.

1254
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:54,880
I played very carefully there.

1255
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,280
He ran...

1256
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,300
He ran in a straight line for me.

1257
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,360
Like, there was...

1258
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,540
It was just...

1259
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:01,780
There was no outplay for him.

1260
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:03,560
Like...

1261
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:06,760
I think if he knew where I was, he could have more ability.

1262
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,680
I also don't like this.

1263
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:12,060
I personally do not like this map for arenas in general.

1264
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,720
Damn, Doki, do you like anything?

1265
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,900
It's just this general area.

1266
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:21,220
Oh, they're over here.

1267
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,120
They're gonna come up from that side, maybe.

1268
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,520
Jesus Christ.

1269
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,680
You okay there, buddy?

1270
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,000
Nah, I'm unlucky.

1271
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:37,720
Unlucky here.

1272
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:39,800
Who's next?

1273
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:41,140
Who?

1274
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:50,100
There you go.

1275
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,360
All right, who's washed?

1276
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:53,460
Who's washed?

1277
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,820
Who's fucking washed out?

1278
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:04,320
Yeah, who's fucking washed out, baby?

1279
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:09,420
That's okay, right?

1280
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:12,220
Got my gun!

1281
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:14,120
Now it's over!

1282
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:15,540
How much money do I have?

1283
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:16,420
All right, fuck it.

1284
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:18,900
You're better.

1285
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:20,380
Oh, dang.

1286
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:24,420
That's right.

1287
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,840
That's fucking right, baby.

1288
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,240
That's fucking right!

1289
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,180
Better be playing against Khoshan, yes.

1290
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:37,040
All right.

1291
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,180
Let's see.

1292
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:41,740
Where are I...

1293
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:42,740
I hate...

1294
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,400
I'm so bad at this tracker shit!

1295
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:51,460
Okay.

1296
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:55,580
Jesus, no.

1297
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:56,260
Fuck.

1298
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,620
I'm just gonna put mine in, too.

1299
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:08,560
Oh, no.

1300
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,780
Okay, it's me versus...

1301
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:24,590
There we go.

1302
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:26,050
Let's go!

1303
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:28,150
That's right, Khoshan!

1304
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:29,150
Maybe you're washed!

1305
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:29,690
Oh, sorry.

1306
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:30,630
That was like...

1307
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:32,290
Sorry, that's the adrenaline calling.

1308
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:33,510
You're a good player, Khoshan.

1309
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:38,450
Sorry.

1310
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:40,610
He's a good player.

1311
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:42,830
That's just the adrenaline talking, guys.

1312
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:43,950
That's just the...

1313
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:52,530
Oh, I can't use that anymore.

1314
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:53,030
Okay.

1315
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:53,830
Fuck.

1316
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:54,270
Okay.

1317
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:55,550
You know what?

1318
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:56,050
If I...

1319
00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:58,490
Maybe I could get away with using two guns here.

1320
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:00,410
All right.

1321
00:48:02,310 --> 00:48:04,650
If I win this, then I don't have to worry.

1322
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:06,310
That's...

1323
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:08,470
He's back.

1324
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:12,030
That's right.

1325
00:48:12,270 --> 00:48:15,030
And to be fair, I am using my best guns, to be fair.

1326
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:20,650
I'm still really bad at this whole tracking shit thing.

1327
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:22,630
Yeah.

1328
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:23,990
Oh, I can break it.

1329
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:24,330
Okay.

1330
00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:25,710
That's good to know.

1331
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:28,570
That's actually really good to know.

1332
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:31,490
Oh.

1333
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:35,030
All right.

1334
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:37,610
I don't know...

1335
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:38,210
Oh, shit.

1336
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:38,630
Okay.

1337
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:42,150
I don't know where exactly they're gonna be going towards.

1338
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:42,610
Oh.

1339
00:48:43,310 --> 00:48:45,050
I'll make sure I don't get flanked, too.

1340
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:48,470
Are they all this way?

1341
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:53,260
Okay.

1342
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:53,880
I'm just...

1343
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,600
I'm getting across throughout my team.

1344
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:02,270
There you go.

1345
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:06,390
Oh, they're gonna res, though.

1346
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:08,010
There's no way they don't res that.

1347
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:10,970
That's a good area to res.

1348
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:13,730
What?

1349
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:22,840
Oh, he got the bat off.

1350
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,000
That's unlucky.

1351
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:25,800
Oh, my God.

1352
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:28,540
My teammate got fucking ran at.

1353
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,380
That's unlucky.

1354
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,420
Sudden death.

1355
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:32,960
No!

1356
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:34,620
I lost all the good guns!

1357
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:35,740
Guys!

1358
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,780
I put it all on this!

1359
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:39,940
Guys!

1360
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:41,640
How could you lose?

1361
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:48,640
What am I gonna do now?

1362
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:49,600
Broke!

1363
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:50,120
Oh, wait.

1364
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:50,680
I'm not broke.

1365
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:51,200
I'm not.

1366
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:51,560
Okay.

1367
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:53,800
All right.

1368
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:55,900
She just played...

1369
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:56,580
What do you mean?

1370
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:58,460
I got the first kill!

1371
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:00,800
I got their best player!

1372
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:01,280
Okay.

1373
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,000
No, that's not true.

1374
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,580
They have another player that has a 20 bomb.

1375
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,120
Am I...

1376
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:06,760
Oh, my God.

1377
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:07,340
I'm like...

1378
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:08,000
How do I...

1379
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:08,740
Jesus Christ!

1380
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,580
I'm at 1v3 people with 20 bomb.

1381
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:12,120
You guys still play this game regularly.

1382
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,680
I've been on the fucking third-person grind.

1383
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:15,780
Oh, my God.

1384
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:16,620
Sorry.

1385
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:17,320
That's toxic.

1386
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:18,160
I'm...

1387
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,800
All I'm saying, I've been on the third-person grind for so long.

1388
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:28,060
How are you guys losing to me in a 1v3 scenario?

1389
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,780
That should never be, like...

1390
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:32,160
That is actually embarrassing.

1391
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:34,480
Like...

1392
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:40,840
That is absolutely very embarrassing for you to be losing this.

1393
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:45,130
Oh, my God.

1394
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:49,850
Where?

1395
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:52,550
Guys, please don't get picked.

1396
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:54,310
I beg of you.

1397
00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:56,810
I need to reset.

1398
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:57,450
I need to reset.

1399
00:50:57,650 --> 00:50:58,790
I'm like, not even...

1400
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:01,370
I'm not even, like, buying the right thing.

1401
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:04,030
If I lose this, it's not...

1402
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:06,410
There is no way it's because of me.

1403
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:09,250
I literally clutched this from my team so many times.

1404
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:12,790
Jesus Christ, I can't...

1405
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:20,560
I have not even Bach grenades.

1406
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:21,860
I should have Bach grenades, guys.

1407
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,720
I realized that that was my...

1408
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,880
That was very dumb of me to not...

1409
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,360
To not do?

1410
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,200
Alright, let's see.

1411
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:41,180
This guy was one, two...

1412
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:41,340
Fuck!

1413
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:50,310
Jesus Christ, okay.

1414
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:51,670
I wish you told me...

1415
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:52,230
What the fuck?

1416
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:00,930
Just...

1417
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,170
Just for the sake of it.

1418
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:08,430
You know, it's toxic, but I take it.

1419
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:08,730
Aw, shoot.

1420
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:10,990
Okay.

1421
00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:17,950
I'll full heal.

1422
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:24,780
You know what?

1423
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:25,380
Yeah, I can get this.

1424
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,180
Yeah, they're gonna get that res too.

1425
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,380
What the fuck?

1426
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,220
That's bad for me, actually.

1427
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,600
That's actually really bad for me.

1428
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:39,340
Alright.

1429
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:41,160
They got the res off and I didn't.

1430
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,120
Let's see, I can look.

1431
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:49,240
It's fine.

1432
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,800
Oh my god, this is not fine.

1433
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:52,780
Oh my god.

1434
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:54,040
It's fine.

1435
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:56,300
Fuck.

1436
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:56,380
Fuck.

1437
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:57,640
Aww.

1438
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:01,280
That sucks.

1439
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:02,820
That's not on me, though.

1440
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,500
I should have pushed it.

1441
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:05,900
I actually should have pushed it.

1442
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:07,040
Aww.

1443
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:08,520
My god.

1444
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,980
I should have pushed that instead of like fucking... I played for the team.

1445
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:16,140
I... I shouldn't have played for the team.

1446
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,320
I... I... I had my Marvel reign.

1447
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:20,940
I was Marvel Rivals brain.

1448
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:21,840
But you know what?

1449
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,160
I won all my 1v1s against Caution.

1450
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:24,960
Like...

1451
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:29,680
I... I out... I outplayed Caution.

1452
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:30,980
That's all I care about.

1453
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:35,180
Never played for the team.

1454
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,020
Oh, I should have just went for a straight on.

1455
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:41,720
Um... Was this a team-based game?

1456
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:42,780
Come on, Doki.

1457
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:48,940
The moment I stopped playing for a team, it was easy.

1458
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:50,160
It was...

1459
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:56,900
I was just like, God damn it, Doki.

1460
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:57,320
Why?

1461
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:59,320
Why did you care?

1462
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:01,040
Why?

1463
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:02,960
You shouldn't have cared.

1464
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:09,880
I... I literally... I literally... The two points I got was me 1v3-ing them.

1465
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:11,780
That... That was how we won.

1466
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:14,960
That was like... Playing for the team.

1467
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:16,540
And just say thank you for the super chat.

1468
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:16,980
Thank you.

1469
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:17,600
Thank you.

1470
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:17,720
Thank you.

1471
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:18,860
Like, I'm sick.

1472
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:20,060
It's actually...

1473
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:25,940
It's so embarrassing for the enemy team to get 1v3 by me.

1474
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:32,020
I have not been playing... Like, I've been... I've been playing Rivals the last two of the three months.

1475
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:34,600
It is embarrassing for them.

1476
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:37,280
Like... Because they have not stopped.

1477
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,260
I know they haven't stopped playing Apex.

1478
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:48,480
My Oshii still got it.

1479
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:50,860
Yeah, you're right.

1480
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:54,380
Doki from four years ago would have never played for the team.

1481
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:02,160
It's literally on them that they... That they let me do that.

1482
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:07,720
Sorry.

1483
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:08,220
Caution.

1484
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:09,240
Like, he's... Okay.

1485
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,160
He is a good player.

1486
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:10,880
I would say.

1487
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:11,740
He is a good player.

1488
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:12,760
But it's embarrassing.

1489
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:13,680
God, bro.

1490
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:14,480
It's embarrassing.

1491
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:19,480
Okay.

1492
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:21,580
You know what?

1493
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,300
I have, like, my odds.

1494
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:26,060
Yes!

1495
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:26,940
All right.

1496
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:27,880
You want to see... Okay.

1497
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,840
You want to see, like... See me lose every fight?

1498
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:32,520
Let's get on your...

1499
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:33,920
You guys are enjoying your...

1500
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:37,060
You want to see me lose every shot and fight?

1501
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,040
Watch this.

1502
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,800
I like those odds.

1503
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:41,020
I... Oh my god.

1504
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:41,300
Wait.

1505
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:42,140
No!

1506
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,380
It's the defu...

1507
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:43,660
No!

1508
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:44,260
Okay.

1509
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,140
This is the fat wingman skin.

1510
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:49,240
My skin didn't transfer...

1511
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:51,300
I forgot to re-requip this.

1512
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:52,280
Because your skins don't...

1513
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,700
Your skins transfer over?

1514
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,040
But you have to re-equip it.

1515
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:03,280
You have to re-equip your skins.

1516
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:04,560
So, like, that sucks.

1517
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:05,480
Oh, okay.

1518
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,180
This is bad.

1519
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:12,220
Jesus Christ.

1520
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:12,600
Okay.

1521
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:19,940
Oh!

1522
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,060
That would have been cool if I hit that.

1523
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:22,900
That...

1524
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,700
But I'm not used to aiming with the...

1525
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:28,320
Thick wingman.

1526
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:30,040
The thick wingman is not it.

1527
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:30,360
Alright.

1528
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:31,660
Now I play serious.

1529
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:36,480
Yeah.

1530
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:39,060
Um...

1531
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:40,280
Now I play serious.

1532
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,800
Now I got my actual gun.

1533
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:43,320
Now I got...

1534
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:44,320
You know what?

1535
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:45,080
I could buy a grenade.

1536
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:45,520
Fuck you.

1537
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:46,080
I could be broke.

1538
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:47,720
What was that?

1539
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:48,660
I was...

1540
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:50,020
I told you guys!

1541
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:51,280
Ready to see me miss?

1542
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:51,960
Like...

1543
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:54,760
I was very clear with what was gonna happen, guys.

1544
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:57,100
I was incredibly clear.

1545
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,820
I was not trickercoding it.

1546
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,500
But I said, ready to see me whiff.

1547
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:06,700
I hate it.

1548
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,240
But I'm also not used to aiming with the fat wingman.

1549
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:13,400
For those who don't know, the wingman skin is...

1550
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,160
There are...

1551
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,780
There's pay-to-win apex skins here.

1552
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,480
And that was one of them.

1553
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:18,480
Okay.

1554
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:19,220
Is this...

1555
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:19,600
Why?

1556
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:23,760
Sucks for me.

1557
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:26,960
Okay.

1558
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:29,020
Oh, they naded me.

1559
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:31,240
Jesus, that was a good nad.

1560
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:32,660
That was actually a really good nad.

1561
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:34,680
Oh my god, no.

1562
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:37,300
I don't know my keybinds.

1563
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:37,660
I forgot.

1564
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:39,220
I was trying to swap my...

1565
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:40,560
I used my swap...

1566
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,160
I used the wrong keybind.

1567
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:44,560
God damn it.

1568
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:45,880
That was my bad.

1569
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:47,860
My...

1570
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:51,240
I have a swap gun keybind on...

1571
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,480
But I used my melee instead.

1572
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:55,420
I was gonna swap my gun.

1573
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:58,000
Oh, that would've been like...

1574
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,240
So cool if I got that kill.

1575
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:00,840
Yeah.

1576
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,980
No, it was just my fault.

1577
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:04,500
I...

1578
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:05,280
Forgot...

1579
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,860
Because I have a swap gun keybind.

1580
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:07,800
But...

1581
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,580
I like forgot which one was it.

1582
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:11,500
I used my...

1583
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:13,380
I used my melee instead.

1584
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,440
So I did this.

1585
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:18,940
Instead of my swap gun.

1586
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:19,720
But you'll see.

1587
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:20,140
You'll see.

1588
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:20,900
You'll see, guys.

1589
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:22,840
Because it's like my mouse buttons.

1590
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:25,400
That's why I accidentally made it.

1591
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:29,680
That's why I just made it.

1592
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:30,460
Alright.

1593
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:31,560
I forgot.

1594
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:35,060
It should give me one automatically, right?

1595
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:35,600
Yeah, see?

1596
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:36,220
So...

1597
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:36,940
I have this.

1598
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:38,020
So you see that?

1599
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:39,600
I swap my gun.

1600
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:40,860
But I did this instead.

1601
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:42,900
Because it was my other mouse button.

1602
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,360
I was like, which mouse button is it?

1603
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:46,060
Let's try and find out live.

1604
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:51,340
Okay.

1605
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:52,140
You know what?

1606
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,460
Where are they?

1607
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:56,880
Let's see.

1608
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:59,660
I know, like, one guy likes to fucking flank, so...

1609
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:01,760
I'm gonna do it.

1610
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:02,240
There you go.

1611
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:03,660
There he is.

1612
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:09,100
He's a idiot.

1613
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:10,840
Okay.

1614
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:14,740
Why are you guys...

1615
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:19,700
Why?

1616
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:20,060
Why?

1617
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:24,860
Why was he playing like that?

1618
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:27,900
Okay, wait.

1619
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:31,920
Yeah, I fucking knew he was there.

1620
00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:44,950
I was gonna say, he can...

1621
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:46,730
Alright, I don't have to use that.

1622
00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:48,430
Yay!

1623
00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:53,370
Alright.

1624
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:56,710
I knew close range, I win that close range.

1625
00:59:58,110 --> 00:59:58,830
Oh, fuck.

1626
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:00,350
Okay, now I don't know what to do.

1627
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,350
I used all my good guns, guys.

1628
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:05,930
Okay, I guess I could flatline.

1629
01:00:06,090 --> 01:00:07,330
I'm not very good at flatline.

1630
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:11,970
This is like, ride or die.

1631
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:14,150
Ride or die!

1632
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:15,450
Alright.

1633
01:00:16,930 --> 01:00:17,910
If we lose...

1634
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:19,310
If we win this, yippee.

1635
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:21,610
If we lose this, I already used up all my money.

1636
01:00:22,670 --> 01:00:23,490
And then, yeah.

1637
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:29,160
I had to use that.

1638
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:30,660
That ult was really good for my end.

1639
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:34,940
I'm just gonna...

1640
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:37,800
Oh, they're over there.

1641
01:00:47,570 --> 01:00:49,230
I should hit him twice.

1642
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:49,530
Yeah.

1643
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:50,330
Whoops.

1644
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:51,390
I hit myself.

1645
01:00:54,670 --> 01:00:55,330
Whoops.

1646
01:00:57,810 --> 01:01:00,270
Bro, stop ego peeking!

1647
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:05,050
I hear them.

1648
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:06,570
I hear them close by.

1649
01:01:21,450 --> 01:01:22,110
No!

1650
01:01:22,770 --> 01:01:23,670
There we go.

1651
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:29,940
Hoping I get this out.

1652
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:31,600
No.

1653
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:33,080
They're weak.

1654
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:34,320
They're weak?

1655
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:36,000
Fuck.

1656
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:42,620
They were not weak.

1657
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:44,840
No!

1658
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:46,160
They were not weak.

1659
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:46,660
Aw.

1660
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,460
They were not weak.

1661
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:50,160
Aw.

1662
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:51,020
I need this.

1663
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:51,300
Yeah.

1664
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:53,000
I needed a shatter cap there.

1665
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:54,320
His AD strafe was good.

1666
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:56,680
That guy's AD strafe fucked me up.

1667
01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:57,140
Okay.

1668
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:58,780
Please contribute.

1669
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:03,740
Team, please contribute.

1670
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:04,740
I...

1671
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,960
I saw the dam.

1672
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,160
Team, please.

1673
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:12,560
Please contribute.

1674
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:13,560
Team!

1675
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:14,820
Team, please!

1676
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:18,600
Their team had contributions across the board!

1677
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:24,360
Any tips on ADStrape?

1678
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:25,880
It's just be unpredictable.

1679
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:29,780
Okay, if I had the practice range, I could show you guys.

1680
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:31,260
Okay, I can actually.

1681
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:32,680
I can show Narenas.

1682
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:39,320
I can... He's... He's basically playing on your own.

1683
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,100
This is Narenas.

1684
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:47,300
Doesn't matter!

1685
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:49,960
Why do I have to pick up the load?

1686
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:54,920
I used all... You're right.

1687
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:58,260
I used all my team gotchas in the first couple of matches.

1688
01:02:58,260 --> 01:02:58,840
You're right.

1689
01:02:59,300 --> 01:02:59,820
Oh my gosh.

1690
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:00,880
Seven hours.

1691
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:02,620
Narenas left.

1692
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:05,140
Please spare me.

1693
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,020
I'm so tired.

1694
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:16,110
Oh my god.

1695
01:03:17,390 --> 01:03:19,270
I'm so tired.

1696
01:03:20,850 --> 01:03:24,970
Give me... Give me back my battle royale.

1697
01:03:28,690 --> 01:03:31,510
I do keep asking for after me.

1698
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:33,110
Thank you for the super chat.

1699
01:03:33,230 --> 01:03:33,490
Thank you.

1700
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:34,030
Thank you.

1701
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:34,890
Oh my god.

1702
01:03:35,290 --> 01:03:37,450
Funny story about yesterday.

1703
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:39,630
Someone asked that during the meet and greet.

1704
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:41,230
And then like...

1705
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:44,710
And then like it caught like the entire staff off guard.

1706
01:03:45,070 --> 01:03:48,150
And then like the staff came in and was like apologize.

1707
01:03:48,310 --> 01:03:49,330
We're so sorry.

1708
01:03:49,670 --> 01:03:55,870
Next time we'll make sure we'll cut the mic out if anyone asks questions without our approval.

1709
01:03:58,630 --> 01:04:00,010
And then like...

1710
01:04:00,010 --> 01:04:01,550
And then like...

1711
01:04:01,550 --> 01:04:02,810
I was like, no, it's okay.

1712
01:04:02,810 --> 01:04:03,830
It was pretty funny.

1713
01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:05,770
Literally like we're so sorry.

1714
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:07,610
I was like, no, it's funny.

1715
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:08,210
It was funny.

1716
01:04:08,350 --> 01:04:08,730
It was cool.

1717
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:14,020
Okay.

1718
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:15,220
Let's see.

1719
01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:17,180
I don't know what to do for first.

1720
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:17,700
Oh, wait.

1721
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:18,900
I'm fucking vantaged.

1722
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:19,760
God fucking.

1723
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:20,760
That was not paying attention.

1724
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:24,400
I was not paying attention as to what the fuck I was.

1725
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:26,420
Eh, fuck it.

1726
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:27,520
Let's just rainbow check.

1727
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:29,880
Uh...

1728
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:31,500
Tackle that guy.

1729
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:35,020
That's right.

1730
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:38,360
I'm married to the grind.

1731
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:43,700
It's all about the grind, baby.

1732
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:44,780
Okay.

1733
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:45,220
Oh, yeah.

1734
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:45,460
I forgot.

1735
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:47,320
I'll show you guys how to make an AD strafe.

1736
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:48,020
Unpredictable.

1737
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:49,120
How the fuck?

1738
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:49,480
Okay.

1739
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:50,220
This is stupid.

1740
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:51,140
I... Oh, my God.

1741
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:52,540
I can't believe I'm on echo.

1742
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:54,600
I'm on vantage.

1743
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,020
They're like over there.

1744
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:02,760
I saw them.

1745
01:05:09,650 --> 01:05:11,610
They're running fucking Gibby.

1746
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:21,980
Bro.

1747
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:24,420
Bro, fucking...

1748
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:25,040
Oh, my God.

1749
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:26,740
This guy is like a pussy.

1750
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:27,820
Right now.

1751
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:29,900
Jesus.

1752
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:30,680
Oh, my God.

1753
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,640
You play like a fucking pussy!

1754
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:37,820
Actually cringe.

1755
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:38,760
Holy shit.

1756
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:43,740
Get some mock grenades.

1757
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:49,760
Okay, that was like...

1758
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:50,840
That was Gibby.

1759
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:52,020
I was like, you're on Gibby!

1760
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:52,480
Why?

1761
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:54,020
You have an arm shield!

1762
01:05:54,540 --> 01:05:57,300
Why would you possibly be scared?

1763
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:58,960
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1764
01:05:59,320 --> 01:05:59,460
Okay.

1765
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:01,100
You're fucking dead.

1766
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:04,780
Oh, my God.

1767
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:04,980
Oh, my God.

1768
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:06,280
And you're playing lifeline, too.

1769
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,000
Oh, my God.

1770
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:13,000
She is wild.

1771
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:16,020
Bro, they're playing fucking res.

1772
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:17,460
Oh, my God.

1773
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:19,720
All right.

1774
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:20,700
Let me...

1775
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:24,080
Now that I got my shit gun out of the way...

1776
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:25,260
Now...

1777
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:27,700
Suna, thank you for the Akasupa!

1778
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:28,580
Thank you!

1779
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:29,220
Thank you!

1780
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:29,980
Oh, my God!

1781
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:31,040
I love my brother.

1782
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:33,440
Suna was the one that did the membership wallpaper.

1783
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:34,800
Uh...

1784
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,020
The membership wallpaper.

1785
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:36,900
Uh...

1786
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:38,000
For April.

1787
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:38,880
Uh...

1788
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:39,860
The barista one.

1789
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:40,780
Oh, my God!

1790
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:41,980
Suna, I just paid...

1791
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:42,860
I paid you!

1792
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:44,200
And you paid me back!

1793
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:46,080
Thank you!

1794
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:48,500
I really appreciate it.

1795
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:50,680
This is what you get when you get too much.

1796
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,660
Bro, he has an arm shield!

1797
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:54,940
He did not have to jiggle peek!

1798
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:57,060
And that guy is a fucking pussy!

1799
01:06:58,380 --> 01:06:59,760
If I have an...

1800
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,500
If you have an arm shield, you get one free fucking shot.

1801
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:03,400
Like...

1802
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:04,300
One free peek!

1803
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:07,320
He was playing so cautious for a Gibraltar.

1804
01:07:07,620 --> 01:07:08,660
That's all I'm saying.

1805
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:10,880
Okay.

1806
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:12,620
We...

1807
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:13,340
I did...

1808
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:14,220
Oh, my...

1809
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:15,080
Jesus Christ.

1810
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,260
I thought I was...

1811
01:07:16,260 --> 01:07:17,260
Guys!

1812
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:18,940
You can tell how I thought...

1813
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:20,700
I thought I was...

1814
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:21,520
Someone else.

1815
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:22,140
You can tell.

1816
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:24,000
Oh, no.

1817
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:27,480
I thought I was a different character, guys.

1818
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:30,180
Alright.

1819
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:32,740
Where are they?

1820
01:07:34,340 --> 01:07:35,280
Oh, my God.

1821
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:35,880
Where...

1822
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:36,980
How...

1823
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:38,600
I'm trying to figure out where they are.

1824
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:43,160
Swear to God.

1825
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:43,840
Oh, my God.

1826
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:48,400
Okay.

1827
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:54,900
I'm not getting that stupid fucking res off you lifeline.

1828
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:57,980
I know you are lifeline.

1829
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:59,420
You're not getting that res off.

1830
01:08:03,350 --> 01:08:04,230
You're such a...

1831
01:08:04,230 --> 01:08:04,390
You're such a...

1832
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:05,270
Bitch, too.

1833
01:08:05,390 --> 01:08:06,570
If you're gonna try...

1834
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:11,140
I don't hear him.

1835
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:12,520
I'm taking shots.

1836
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:13,340
So, I can do this.

1837
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:15,920
I went for it because I couldn't hear.

1838
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:18,240
That's fine.

1839
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:20,000
I still have my other teammates.

1840
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:25,320
Who I believe won't be dead weight, right?

1841
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:27,520
Jesus Christ, really?

1842
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:34,960
Don't be dead weight.

1843
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:37,140
Don't be dead weight.

1844
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:37,380
Don't be dead weight.

1845
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:38,180
Cause I got two.

1846
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:41,440
Don't be dead weight.

1847
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:43,020
Oh, my God.

1848
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:43,780
Thank God.

1849
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:44,220
Okay.

1850
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:45,160
I...

1851
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:47,760
I was gonna...

1852
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:49,580
I was gonna be like...

1853
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:50,340
These...

1854
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:51,560
Two of these players...

1855
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:52,820
I know...

1856
01:08:52,820 --> 01:08:54,420
Still play as Apex.

1857
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:55,340
I...

1858
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:57,420
I was like...

1859
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,180
They got...

1860
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:00,900
Don't...

1861
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:02,760
Don't...

1862
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:03,780
They did it.

1863
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:04,660
I know.

1864
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:05,940
Two of them...

1865
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:07,840
Still plays Apex.

1866
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:09,580
And still plays in rank.

1867
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,480
So, I'm gonna be like...

1868
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:12,720
I swear to God.

1869
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:13,480
I...

1870
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:15,480
Don't be dead weight.

1871
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:17,160
That's all I ask.

1872
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:18,180
Don't be dead weight.

1873
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:18,600
That's all I ask.

1874
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:34,640
Don't be...

1875
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,140
You're like pure...

1876
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:37,280
It's your raw aim.

1877
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:39,220
It's good for like...

1878
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:39,720
Aim practice.

1879
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:40,760
But I fucking hate it.

1880
01:09:40,860 --> 01:09:41,520
Because like...

1881
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:42,380
People play like...

1882
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:42,900
Pussy sometimes.

1883
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:44,840
Like...

1884
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:46,520
People play...

1885
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:47,060
Like...

1886
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:47,980
They don't...

1887
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:48,900
Oh, my God.

1888
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:49,660
They...

1889
01:09:49,660 --> 01:09:50,940
I don't know how to explain it.

1890
01:09:50,940 --> 01:09:52,420
They just play in such a way...

1891
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:53,380
That makes me mad.

1892
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:55,820
He...

1893
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:56,220
Jesus Christ.

1894
01:09:56,580 --> 01:09:56,880
Like...

1895
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:57,940
Get be lifeline.

1896
01:09:58,340 --> 01:09:58,760
Like...

1897
01:09:58,760 --> 01:09:59,360
In arena.

1898
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:04,700
Get be lifeline in arena.

1899
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:05,720
Especially, too.

1900
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:07,040
Bro, I...

1901
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:08,140
Can see you.

1902
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:15,670
You're really gonna use an akimbo.

1903
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:20,980
I swear to god, team.

1904
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:28,240
Jesus Christ, you're not better than me.

1905
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:33,780
Heal yourself three times.

1906
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:42,220
Heal yourself three times and see how it goes.

1907
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:47,220
All right.

1908
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:48,360
Okay, guys, I'm okay.

1909
01:10:48,820 --> 01:10:49,220
Sorry.

1910
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,460
Sorry, Sue, now that I get to see this.

1911
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:52,700
I'm sorry.

1912
01:10:57,460 --> 01:10:58,700
All right, let's see.

1913
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:06,320
Normally, I don't want to run havoc, but...

1914
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:07,720
Okay.

1915
01:11:08,780 --> 01:11:09,840
Sit down.

1916
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,240
But it's true.

1917
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:13,540
I see Preet is awesome.

1918
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:15,180
So...

1919
01:11:15,550 --> 01:11:18,260
Guys, this is why I play support in Rivals.

1920
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:23,620
I would be so fucked up if I placed DPS in Rival Rivals.

1921
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:25,060
I would not be okay.

1922
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:29,000
This is how angry I am.

1923
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:30,400
I can get really angry.

1924
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:31,300
And...

1925
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:34,360
You know what?

1926
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:36,780
I forgot.

1927
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:37,900
I'm not fucking...

1928
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:39,760
I keep thinking I'm... for some reason...

1929
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:42,060
I keep thinking I'm someone else.

1930
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:44,180
Aw.

1931
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:46,220
Oh my god.

1932
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:48,420
I think their goal is just to get me out of the game.

1933
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:49,160
Honestly.

1934
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:57,620
Oh my god.

1935
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:00,660
I can't do this.

1936
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:01,660
Close range.

1937
01:12:01,660 --> 01:12:02,480
No.

1938
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:03,460
No!

1939
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:04,260
Fuck!

1940
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:05,860
I thought that covers me.

1941
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:07,360
Oh, I threw.

1942
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:09,140
I thought that was cover.

1943
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:10,920
Oh my god.

1944
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:12,920
I thought I was uncovered.

1945
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:14,060
That sucks.

1946
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:15,160
I'm so sad.

1947
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:16,260
I threw that.

1948
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:16,820
No!

1949
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:19,480
Ah!

1950
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:22,860
Stupid arenas!

1951
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:25,740
Abbing was not it.

1952
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:26,080
No.

1953
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:27,180
I thought they...

1954
01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:28,600
They fixed the recoil.

1955
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:29,680
But...

1956
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:30,440
Oh my god.

1957
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:32,340
They got rid of all my favorite guns.

1958
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:34,240
I don't know what to use.

1959
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:39,000
All the guns I usually use is like taken.

1960
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:41,040
So I'm like, what the fuck do I play?

1961
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:43,420
We'll just go all out.

1962
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:44,440
Honestly.

1963
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:45,240
There we go.

1964
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:48,980
Which one is this?

1965
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:49,600
Okay.

1966
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:50,240
It's burst fire.

1967
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:50,560
Okay.

1968
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,940
I just have to figure out if it's burst fire or not.

1969
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:54,940
Oh, I can't.

1970
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:55,160
Okay.

1971
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:56,320
Alright.

1972
01:12:58,800 --> 01:12:59,600
Alright.

1973
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:00,060
My god.

1974
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:02,140
Now I have to use different...

1975
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:03,260
Now I have to use util.

1976
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:04,980
Fucking util.

1977
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:06,520
God damn it.

1978
01:13:06,620 --> 01:13:07,660
You fucking suck.

1979
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:10,560
Stupid util.

1980
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:17,420
God damn fucking util tab.

1981
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:21,780
I gotta make sure there's no people crossing us from here.

1982
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:24,980
I hear them.

1983
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:26,620
Actually?

1984
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:27,480
No.

1985
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:29,920
No, I do.

1986
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:31,560
There's people there here.

1987
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:39,500
I hear them, but...

1988
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:40,260
Where?

1989
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:43,920
Okay.

1990
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:44,260
Okay.

1991
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:44,620
Over there.

1992
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:45,020
Okay.

1993
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:49,160
This is really...

1994
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:49,580
I'm throwing.

1995
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:53,820
I will admit I'm throwing if our team loses this because of this.

1996
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:08,640
You're dumb.

1997
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:10,820
You're actually dumb.

1998
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:12,780
Oh my god.

1999
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:13,720
You're actually...

2000
01:14:17,390 --> 01:14:18,770
Oh my god.

2001
01:14:19,470 --> 01:14:20,390
Oh my god.

2002
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:20,870
Oh, fuck.

2003
01:14:20,990 --> 01:14:21,750
He had a Mastiff.

2004
01:14:21,830 --> 01:14:23,190
I didn't count on the Mastiff.

2005
01:14:23,590 --> 01:14:24,470
God damn it.

2006
01:14:25,490 --> 01:14:26,670
Where's my support?

2007
01:14:27,850 --> 01:14:28,950
Bro, I swear to god.

2008
01:14:29,050 --> 01:14:29,430
I'm gonna...

2009
01:14:29,430 --> 01:14:31,530
I'm gonna go Joker mode and go Lifeline.

2010
01:14:31,990 --> 01:14:32,310
I...

2011
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:36,370
I was throwing.

2012
01:14:36,370 --> 01:14:37,510
I didn't say I was throwing.

2013
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:38,970
Oh my god.

2014
01:14:39,290 --> 01:14:41,770
I was gonna go Joker mode and I would...

2015
01:14:41,770 --> 01:14:42,610
I'm gonna go Lifeline.

2016
01:14:42,670 --> 01:14:43,270
That's it.

2017
01:14:43,350 --> 01:14:44,330
I'm going Lifeline.

2018
01:14:46,370 --> 01:14:47,470
If I can't...

2019
01:14:47,470 --> 01:14:49,770
If no one supports me, I support myself.

2020
01:14:54,390 --> 01:14:56,190
I have to be the support.

2021
01:14:56,430 --> 01:14:57,650
I swear to god.

2022
01:14:58,130 --> 01:14:59,670
I'm gonna be the support.

2023
01:14:59,670 --> 01:15:00,210
Alright.

2024
01:15:02,590 --> 01:15:03,170
Be fair.

2025
01:15:03,330 --> 01:15:04,630
My character had like...

2026
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:06,930
My character's abilities was not helpful too.

2027
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:13,740
If no one will support me, I shall support myself.

2028
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:15,340
I shall fight.

2029
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:17,120
I'll do it myself.

2030
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:20,820
Also, let me grab my fucking gun skin.

2031
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,780
If I want to do wingman again.

2032
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:24,920
Let's see.

2033
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:26,400
Wingman skins.

2034
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:26,740
Yeah.

2035
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:27,860
It's so weird.

2036
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,260
They have like...

2037
01:15:29,260 --> 01:15:29,820
Oh wait.

2038
01:15:29,820 --> 01:15:30,980
They unlock everything.

2039
01:15:31,180 --> 01:15:31,280
Okay.

2040
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:32,080
So...

2041
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:33,260
Which one was it?

2042
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:35,000
I use this...

2043
01:15:35,660 --> 01:15:36,740
I use the dismantler.

2044
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:37,100
Oh yeah.

2045
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:37,340
You guys.

2046
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:38,860
You can have access to all your skins.

2047
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:39,800
To ev...

2048
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:40,480
Not all your skins.

2049
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:41,860
To every skin in this game.

2050
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:42,580
Whoa.

2051
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:43,860
Whoa.

2052
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:44,100
Oh wait.

2053
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:44,200
No.

2054
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:44,920
This is my skin.

2055
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:45,840
I use the death ray.

2056
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,420
I use this for...

2057
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:49,580
Um...

2058
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:50,480
For my wingman.

2059
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:52,700
Oh my god.

2060
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:54,100
Just...

2061
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:57,640
Oh.

2062
01:15:58,560 --> 01:15:58,960
Alright.

2063
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:00,580
I did a dumb...

2064
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:00,760
I...

2065
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:02,440
I did a Hail Mary there.

2066
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:04,140
Um...

2067
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:05,340
But I didn't think he had...

2068
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:06,680
A lifeline drone.

2069
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:08,400
I should've...

2070
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,740
I should've knew he was gonna get a lifeline drone there.

2071
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:12,780
But that was actually like...

2072
01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:13,300
A...

2073
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:14,260
Hail Mary attempt.

2074
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:14,840
Like...

2075
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:16,200
If it didn't work, we lose.

2076
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:17,640
But if it didn't work, we win.

2077
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:18,520
Cause like...

2078
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:20,480
If I just play with them, then they just collapse...

2079
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:21,180
Around me.

2080
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:26,240
Didn't they change the...

2081
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:27,100
Pay to...

2082
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:28,560
Oh, I should've changed my R9 too.

2083
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:30,620
My R9 flatline needs to be...

2084
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:33,140
The pay to win skins are...

2085
01:16:33,140 --> 01:16:34,120
R9 flatline...

2086
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:36,160
Wingman.

2087
01:16:36,980 --> 01:16:37,500
And...

2088
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:38,640
I think that's it, right?

2089
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:39,740
And massive.

2090
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:41,480
There's a pay to win massive skin too.

2091
01:16:45,890 --> 01:16:46,410
Uh...

2092
01:16:46,410 --> 01:16:48,810
All skins are unlocked in early access.

2093
01:16:49,790 --> 01:16:50,670
Alright, it's time.

2094
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:52,670
I shall be the suppo...

2095
01:16:52,670 --> 01:16:53,830
I will heal myself.

2096
01:16:56,530 --> 01:16:57,470
Streamer mode?

2097
01:16:57,490 --> 01:16:59,070
Okay, this is a three stack.

2098
01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:01,210
What?

2099
01:17:01,570 --> 01:17:04,890
There's no way you put yourself in streamer mode.

2100
01:17:06,310 --> 01:17:08,570
That's a three stack right there.

2101
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:11,570
I refuse to believe they're not three stacking.

2102
01:17:11,570 --> 01:17:11,810
Okay.

2103
01:17:14,690 --> 01:17:15,130
I...

2104
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:16,690
There's no way.

2105
01:17:17,230 --> 01:17:18,210
Alright, what's this?

2106
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:18,910
I'll use this.

2107
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:21,050
Bow check is my throwaway gun choice.

2108
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:23,130
Okay, so...

2109
01:17:23,130 --> 01:17:24,070
This is how you AD's shape.

2110
01:17:24,210 --> 01:17:24,570
It's like...

2111
01:17:26,510 --> 01:17:27,390
It's like...

2112
01:17:27,390 --> 01:17:28,150
You...

2113
01:17:28,150 --> 01:17:31,010
Make sure you go right a little bit too...

2114
01:17:31,550 --> 01:17:31,970
It's like...

2115
01:17:31,970 --> 01:17:33,210
You gotta be super unpredictable.

2116
01:17:34,390 --> 01:17:34,830
And...

2117
01:17:34,830 --> 01:17:35,770
Yeah, like...

2118
01:17:35,770 --> 01:17:38,770
The thing is, you have to do it unconsciously too.

2119
01:17:38,970 --> 01:17:39,310
Like...

2120
01:17:39,310 --> 01:17:42,370
It can't be, like, something you, like, think about while you're...

2121
01:17:42,370 --> 01:17:43,050
Fighting.

2122
01:17:43,370 --> 01:17:44,750
So, like, that's the hardest part.

2123
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:50,680
The hardest part is just the fact that you have to be able to do it...

2124
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:52,420
In a way that's not conscious.

2125
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:53,180
Like, you...

2126
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:54,940
You're not, like, aware...

2127
01:17:54,940 --> 01:17:56,760
Oh my god, it's tracking.

2128
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:58,240
Are you serious?

2129
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:01,960
Here we go.

2130
01:18:08,830 --> 01:18:09,270
Alright.

2131
01:18:18,980 --> 01:18:20,240
I can't give it to him.

2132
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:20,560
Wait.

2133
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:24,060
Oh my god, that was...

2134
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:24,920
Oh no.

2135
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:26,580
I got flanked by three.

2136
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:29,800
That's unlucky for me.

2137
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,580
Yeah, that was a bad play by me.

2138
01:18:32,740 --> 01:18:34,540
But bow check is my throwaway gun.

2139
01:18:38,540 --> 01:18:40,380
Oh, don't make me...

2140
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:42,460
Don't make me put out...

2141
01:18:42,460 --> 01:18:43,140
That's it.

2142
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:44,520
I'm bringing it out.

2143
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:45,460
That's it.

2144
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:48,260
That's it.

2145
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:50,080
I'm bringing out that gun.

2146
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:52,420
First round is my throwaway round.

2147
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:53,300
You know that.

2148
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:54,100
I...

2149
01:18:58,160 --> 01:18:59,080
That's it.

2150
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:00,520
I'm bringing it.

2151
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,060
Oh, that's good.

2152
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:03,340
Oh, that's good.

2153
01:19:03,340 --> 01:19:03,600
Good play.

2154
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:05,560
Good play by that guy.

2155
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:07,480
I know he's been playing Apex still.

2156
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:11,060
But still, regardless, it's an incredibly good play.

2157
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:14,780
This has...

2158
01:19:14,780 --> 01:19:16,320
There's no way a three...

2159
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:19,660
Like, there's no way they found three solos who did streamer mode.

2160
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:20,540
There's no way.

2161
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:21,720
I refuse to believe.

2162
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:25,940
That's what you say.

2163
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:26,560
I know.

2164
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:27,960
I recognize people.

2165
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:29,200
You cannot say that.

2166
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:32,040
I specifically call out the people I recognize.

2167
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:33,860
I know I've been still playing this game.

2168
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:34,720
That's it.

2169
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:35,520
I'm...

2170
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:36,700
I'm going all in.

2171
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:37,400
I...

2172
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:41,820
I'm going all in.

2173
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:42,440
That's...

2174
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:43,160
Fucking it.

2175
01:19:49,730 --> 01:19:50,890
I'm getting my...

2176
01:19:50,890 --> 01:19:51,750
My R9.

2177
01:19:52,410 --> 01:19:53,530
Why is it replaying this?

2178
01:19:53,530 --> 01:19:54,150
I don't remember.

2179
01:19:54,470 --> 01:19:55,230
I swear to God.

2180
01:19:55,390 --> 01:19:56,330
It was like...

2181
01:19:56,330 --> 01:19:58,010
Lifeline Gyppy is like...

2182
01:19:58,690 --> 01:19:59,290
Um...

2183
01:19:59,290 --> 01:20:00,210
Arena meta?

2184
01:20:00,210 --> 01:20:01,250
I swear to God.

2185
01:20:01,330 --> 01:20:03,130
I swear to God.

2186
01:20:03,450 --> 01:20:03,890
I am.

2187
01:20:04,370 --> 01:20:04,910
I am.

2188
01:20:05,070 --> 01:20:05,730
Will we die?

2189
01:20:05,950 --> 01:20:06,690
Let's find out.

2190
01:20:07,210 --> 01:20:07,550
Whoa.

2191
01:20:08,650 --> 01:20:10,010
Oh, they're not even on this side.

2192
01:20:10,170 --> 01:20:10,930
Of the map.

2193
01:20:11,870 --> 01:20:12,330
That's...

2194
01:20:12,330 --> 01:20:12,830
Awkward.

2195
01:20:15,050 --> 01:20:20,570
My gores, mata wants, Fiifu.

2196
01:20:24,150 --> 01:20:28,030
You never win.

2197
01:20:28,030 --> 01:20:29,150
Oh my God.

2198
01:20:33,890 --> 01:20:36,690
Is working?

2199
01:20:36,690 --> 01:20:38,630
Oh aヒah.

2200
01:20:39,850 --> 01:20:41,250
Jesus.

2201
01:20:43,990 --> 01:20:46,390
Are you...

2202
01:20:46,390 --> 01:20:47,650
They actually bought...

2203
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:49,690
That's... yeah.

2204
01:20:51,590 --> 01:20:54,090
Okay, they are a three stack.

2205
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:58,210
They actually bought Gibeal on round one.

2206
01:20:58,590 --> 01:21:01,710
Oh, that's a real arena team.

2207
01:21:04,750 --> 01:21:06,870
That's actually a real team.

2208
01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:07,950
Oh my god.

2209
01:21:08,550 --> 01:21:11,530
I used up all my gacha luck on the first two matches.

2210
01:21:12,190 --> 01:21:14,710
Now it's like... now it's an uphill battle.

2211
01:21:17,390 --> 01:21:18,730
I should have got two guns.

2212
01:21:18,870 --> 01:21:19,790
I should have got two guns.

2213
01:21:19,930 --> 01:21:22,150
This was my last... chance.

2214
01:21:22,630 --> 01:21:24,330
I could have bought two guns there.

2215
01:21:24,530 --> 01:21:25,230
But I didn't.

2216
01:21:27,450 --> 01:21:28,310
I refused.

2217
01:21:29,710 --> 01:21:30,610
See, look at this.

2218
01:21:30,710 --> 01:21:32,490
This guy was not a coward, at least.

2219
01:21:32,690 --> 01:21:33,550
You know, I...

2220
01:21:33,550 --> 01:21:36,790
At least he wasn't a fucking coward with his arm shield.

2221
01:21:37,210 --> 01:21:39,690
Whoever that Gibe player last game was...

2222
01:21:39,690 --> 01:21:42,150
Goddamn played like a goddamn bitch.

2223
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:50,660
Jesus.

2224
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:51,940
I can't.

2225
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:52,220
I'm sorry.

2226
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:54,220
I can't.

2227
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:54,680
I'm sorry.

2228
01:21:59,110 --> 01:22:00,050
Oh, Jesus Christ.

2229
01:22:00,210 --> 01:22:00,370
No!

2230
01:22:00,670 --> 01:22:01,670
I didn't see him.

2231
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:03,910
He's right here.

2232
01:22:04,530 --> 01:22:05,550
Oh, I threw that.

2233
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:07,450
I didn't realize he had a cross on me.

2234
01:22:07,910 --> 01:22:08,690
Oh, no.

2235
01:22:09,530 --> 01:22:09,950
No!

2236
01:22:10,150 --> 01:22:11,230
He had a cross!

2237
01:22:13,810 --> 01:22:14,410
Right here.

2238
01:22:14,410 --> 01:22:15,170
Oh!

2239
01:22:15,630 --> 01:22:17,430
I need to know who are you.

2240
01:22:18,170 --> 01:22:19,630
Oh, my God.

2241
01:22:20,830 --> 01:22:22,570
Yeah, that's a three stack.

2242
01:22:24,390 --> 01:22:26,070
That's a three stack.

2243
01:22:26,510 --> 01:22:27,190
No.

2244
01:22:27,490 --> 01:22:28,490
I told you.

2245
01:22:28,770 --> 01:22:29,630
I do it!

2246
01:22:29,810 --> 01:22:30,830
I do it!

2247
01:22:31,010 --> 01:22:31,990
We're three stacking!

2248
01:22:32,510 --> 01:22:33,630
I do it!

2249
01:22:34,110 --> 01:22:36,030
I can do it.

2250
01:22:37,550 --> 01:22:38,450
Yo, Doki.

2251
01:22:38,590 --> 01:22:38,950
You good?

2252
01:22:39,150 --> 01:22:39,290
No.

2253
01:22:39,570 --> 01:22:40,150
I'm not.

2254
01:22:41,310 --> 01:22:42,050
I'm not.

2255
01:22:42,550 --> 01:22:43,830
I'm not good.

2256
01:22:44,570 --> 01:22:44,910
I...

2257
01:22:46,070 --> 01:22:47,270
I'm dodging.

2258
01:22:47,670 --> 01:22:48,030
I...

2259
01:22:49,810 --> 01:22:50,810
You don't know.

2260
01:22:50,810 --> 01:22:51,750
I'm not dodging.

2261
01:22:51,770 --> 01:22:52,530
I'm not a pussy.

2262
01:22:53,430 --> 01:22:54,470
I'll get RNG.

2263
01:22:54,650 --> 01:22:56,170
I'll get a good teammate RNG.

2264
01:22:56,330 --> 01:22:56,750
I believe.

2265
01:22:57,070 --> 01:22:57,930
I believe.

2266
01:22:57,950 --> 01:22:58,850
I'm not a pussy.

2267
01:22:59,110 --> 01:23:00,390
I'm not dodging this.

2268
01:23:00,830 --> 01:23:01,330
I...

2269
01:23:03,650 --> 01:23:04,150
Jesus.

2270
01:23:04,370 --> 01:23:05,890
I wish I had a three stack.

2271
01:23:09,870 --> 01:23:10,650
I'm not.

2272
01:23:10,990 --> 01:23:11,490
I'm...

2273
01:23:11,490 --> 01:23:12,890
I'm not dodging.

2274
01:23:13,230 --> 01:23:14,430
I'm not a pussy.

2275
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:18,010
I will eventually get the...

2276
01:23:18,010 --> 01:23:19,650
Wait, I thought this guy was at LAN.

2277
01:23:20,770 --> 01:23:22,230
Is this guy not at LAN?

2278
01:23:22,230 --> 01:23:23,230
How is he here?

2279
01:23:23,730 --> 01:23:24,210
Are they like...

2280
01:23:24,210 --> 01:23:25,570
Oh, are they like letting people play it?

2281
01:23:25,690 --> 01:23:26,250
Oh, maybe.

2282
01:23:26,950 --> 01:23:27,350
Maybe.

2283
01:23:27,810 --> 01:23:28,570
Cause it's finals.

2284
01:23:29,550 --> 01:23:29,850
This...

2285
01:23:29,850 --> 01:23:31,750
Oh, maybe they're letting people play it during LAN.

2286
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:33,070
I won't be surprised.

2287
01:23:39,940 --> 01:23:40,340
Yeah.

2288
01:23:41,140 --> 01:23:42,000
Yeah, I was gonna say.

2289
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:43,120
They might have set up some LAN.

2290
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:44,040
Cause I was like, wait.

2291
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:45,100
How is he here?

2292
01:23:46,220 --> 01:23:46,980
Aren't you...

2293
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:48,500
Aren't you supposed to be at LAN?

2294
01:23:50,380 --> 01:23:51,140
No, no.

2295
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:53,200
He does like MC for LAN.

2296
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:54,180
We the people.

2297
01:23:54,180 --> 01:23:56,680
I always see him MCing and stuff for it.

2298
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:01,040
Oh no, I meant...

2299
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:02,220
He's not in the pro team.

2300
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:03,800
He's in the...

2301
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:05,760
He usually is like one of the staff mem...

2302
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,600
Like not staff, but like...

2303
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:08,180
Um...

2304
01:24:08,180 --> 01:24:08,760
What's it called?

2305
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:09,440
Like the...

2306
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:10,540
Like the host MC.

2307
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:13,740
For ALGS.

2308
01:24:13,740 --> 01:24:13,980
Yes.

2309
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:17,140
So I'm like surprised to see him here.

2310
01:24:17,860 --> 01:24:18,660
Alright, guys.

2311
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:19,800
Where's my throwaway gun?

2312
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,460
I always have one throwaway gun that I don't care about.

2313
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:23,180
Nemesis?

2314
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:23,680
Nah.

2315
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:24,320
Carbon?

2316
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:28,900
These are like my go-to for like...

2317
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:30,700
Maybe I can...

2318
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:31,540
Clutch it.

2319
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:33,900
Caster.

2320
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:34,220
Yeah.

2321
01:24:35,780 --> 01:24:36,260
Usually...

2322
01:24:36,260 --> 01:24:37,640
Well, no, he doesn't cast.

2323
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:38,140
No, no, no.

2324
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:41,460
He's like usually like one of the MCs for it.

2325
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:42,540
Cause like he would like...

2326
01:24:42,540 --> 01:24:43,500
He doesn't cast.

2327
01:24:43,740 --> 01:24:44,640
He just like...

2328
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:45,840
Um...

2329
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:47,140
Helps with MCing stuff.

2330
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:49,200
Oh, Wingman.

2331
01:24:49,260 --> 01:24:50,240
I should've picked Wingman.

2332
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:50,660
You're right.

2333
01:24:51,140 --> 01:24:53,100
That should've been my throwaway gun.

2334
01:24:57,530 --> 01:24:58,350
Oh, fuck.

2335
01:25:00,810 --> 01:25:01,290
Nice.

2336
01:25:08,410 --> 01:25:09,190
Oh, shit.

2337
01:25:09,330 --> 01:25:09,490
Okay.

2338
01:25:11,070 --> 01:25:11,550
Um...

2339
01:25:11,550 --> 01:25:13,410
I'm gonna put my shield up for him.

2340
01:25:13,950 --> 01:25:14,610
Use the shield!

2341
01:25:14,730 --> 01:25:15,330
Use the shield!

2342
01:25:17,490 --> 01:25:18,690
Use the shield!

2343
01:25:18,690 --> 01:25:18,730
Use the shield!

2344
01:25:19,410 --> 01:25:20,050
Use the shield!

2345
01:25:21,550 --> 01:25:22,670
He could've...

2346
01:25:25,690 --> 01:25:26,810
He could've...

2347
01:25:26,810 --> 01:25:27,150
I don't know.

2348
01:25:27,310 --> 01:25:28,950
Usually I have a shield behind it.

2349
01:25:31,070 --> 01:25:32,730
I can't do carbine close range.

2350
01:25:32,990 --> 01:25:34,790
I didn't think he would push that close.

2351
01:25:36,750 --> 01:25:37,310
Ugh.

2352
01:25:37,650 --> 01:25:37,870
Alright.

2353
01:25:39,330 --> 01:25:40,110
It's fine.

2354
01:25:40,110 --> 01:25:40,990
Okay.

2355
01:25:41,390 --> 01:25:41,530
Ugh.

2356
01:25:41,850 --> 01:25:43,110
Gotta get my fucking...

2357
01:25:43,710 --> 01:25:44,090
Ugh.

2358
01:25:44,310 --> 01:25:45,770
Gotta get back my inner groove.

2359
01:25:48,470 --> 01:25:49,370
What shield?

2360
01:25:49,730 --> 01:25:50,570
Oh my...

2361
01:25:50,570 --> 01:25:54,290
Well, you can hide behind my knockdown shield and then heal.

2362
01:25:54,610 --> 01:25:56,250
I was hoping he would do that.

2363
01:25:56,470 --> 01:25:57,650
But he...

2364
01:25:57,650 --> 01:25:58,410
I think he egoed.

2365
01:25:58,990 --> 01:25:59,630
Egoed.

2366
01:25:59,670 --> 01:26:00,150
Pushed it.

2367
01:26:00,890 --> 01:26:02,270
Which is understandable.

2368
01:26:08,550 --> 01:26:10,550
I need to like play a lot more passive.

2369
01:26:11,810 --> 01:26:12,330
Sure.

2370
01:26:19,810 --> 01:26:20,330
Alright.

2371
01:26:20,770 --> 01:26:20,930
Ugh.

2372
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:22,590
God, it's getting sweatier.

2373
01:26:23,830 --> 01:26:26,650
Guys, I miss when the game was less.

2374
01:26:27,430 --> 01:26:28,750
I'm gonna go for the flank here.

2375
01:26:29,650 --> 01:26:30,130
Here.

2376
01:26:34,570 --> 01:26:35,610
Oh my god.

2377
01:26:36,490 --> 01:26:36,810
There you go.

2378
01:26:36,990 --> 01:26:37,230
No.

2379
01:26:38,010 --> 01:26:38,490
Why?

2380
01:26:49,950 --> 01:26:50,990
I just wanna thirst it.

2381
01:26:51,210 --> 01:26:51,730
Please heal.

2382
01:26:51,890 --> 01:26:52,370
Please heal.

2383
01:26:52,870 --> 01:26:54,170
Please heal for the...

2384
01:26:55,870 --> 01:26:56,810
Oh my god.

2385
01:26:56,870 --> 01:26:57,390
He didn't need a heal.

2386
01:26:57,490 --> 01:26:57,830
Thank god.

2387
01:26:58,230 --> 01:26:58,710
Okay.

2388
01:26:58,830 --> 01:27:00,310
I was gonna be like, please heal.

2389
01:27:00,450 --> 01:27:01,250
I swear to god.

2390
01:27:01,730 --> 01:27:01,870
Alright.

2391
01:27:02,130 --> 01:27:05,470
Seeing you with no shields is like stressing me out.

2392
01:27:05,790 --> 01:27:05,970
Alright.

2393
01:27:07,270 --> 01:27:08,270
I was like...

2394
01:27:08,270 --> 01:27:08,730
Please.

2395
01:27:08,730 --> 01:27:08,910
Please.

2396
01:27:09,730 --> 01:27:11,250
I need you to heal.

2397
01:27:12,030 --> 01:27:12,850
That's all.

2398
01:27:13,090 --> 01:27:13,610
I...

2399
01:27:13,610 --> 01:27:14,690
Don't ask for much.

2400
01:27:15,070 --> 01:27:15,730
I don't...

2401
01:27:16,630 --> 01:27:20,050
Matt was jumping around with no shields.

2402
01:27:20,330 --> 01:27:21,170
And I was like, please.

2403
01:27:21,370 --> 01:27:22,530
We're still playing.

2404
01:27:26,410 --> 01:27:27,010
Okay.

2405
01:27:27,430 --> 01:27:29,890
He had confidence in his...

2406
01:27:29,890 --> 01:27:31,130
I was like, oh my god.

2407
01:27:31,310 --> 01:27:31,610
Please.

2408
01:27:34,050 --> 01:27:34,650
Please.

2409
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:36,150
It's my R9 round.

2410
01:27:36,370 --> 01:27:36,530
Please.

2411
01:27:36,770 --> 01:27:37,070
I...

2412
01:27:37,070 --> 01:27:37,350
I...

2413
01:27:37,350 --> 01:27:39,430
I don't wanna lose my R9 round.

2414
01:27:39,850 --> 01:27:40,170
I...

2415
01:27:42,770 --> 01:27:43,870
Hey, please.

2416
01:27:45,790 --> 01:27:46,450
It sucks.

2417
01:27:46,710 --> 01:27:49,610
I played lifeline so I could like, support myself.

2418
01:27:49,910 --> 01:27:51,410
But in the end...

2419
01:27:51,770 --> 01:27:53,750
In the end, I have to...

2420
01:27:53,750 --> 01:27:56,750
Use my things for my teammates.

2421
01:27:57,550 --> 01:27:58,470
Doesn't that...

2422
01:27:58,470 --> 01:27:58,750
Suck?

2423
01:28:01,850 --> 01:28:02,950
Jesus Christ.

2424
01:28:03,730 --> 01:28:04,610
I'm not...

2425
01:28:04,610 --> 01:28:06,470
Gonna be by myself there.

2426
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:14,180
Oh.

2427
01:28:14,340 --> 01:28:14,480
Oh.

2428
01:28:18,980 --> 01:28:20,040
Oh my god.

2429
01:28:20,260 --> 01:28:20,480
Please.

2430
01:28:22,220 --> 01:28:22,760
There you go.

2431
01:28:24,580 --> 01:28:25,840
Are you serious?

2432
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:28,460
I can't see him.

2433
01:28:33,590 --> 01:28:35,130
Where did he drop too?

2434
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:40,720
Oh!

2435
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:41,060
Oh my god!

2436
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:41,660
It's them!

2437
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:43,680
It's...

2438
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:46,340
The tap straight...

2439
01:28:46,340 --> 01:28:47,200
Oh my god.

2440
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:49,220
The tap straight for that.

2441
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:50,200
The thing is...

2442
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:52,620
I had to pay attention to another player too.

2443
01:28:52,620 --> 01:28:55,500
It comes back to support...

2444
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:56,320
Guys...

2445
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,380
I'm sad...

2446
01:28:58,380 --> 01:28:59,060
Because...

2447
01:28:59,060 --> 01:29:00,780
I played lifeline to support myself...

2448
01:29:01,160 --> 01:29:03,080
But I had to use my drone for my teammates.

2449
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:04,020
I...

2450
01:29:06,820 --> 01:29:08,040
Oh my god.

2451
01:29:08,710 --> 01:29:09,880
God damn it.

2452
01:29:10,460 --> 01:29:11,540
Every time...

2453
01:29:11,540 --> 01:29:13,060
I have to support my team.

2454
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:14,080
When can...

2455
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:15,960
When is it Doki's time?

2456
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:20,340
When is it Doki's time to not care?

2457
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:21,160
I...

2458
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:23,140
She cares too much.

2459
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:24,820
Oh my god.

2460
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:28,200
Stop being supportive.

2461
01:29:28,220 --> 01:29:29,120
I can't!

2462
01:29:30,020 --> 01:29:31,440
I'm too...

2463
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:32,040
I'm too...

2464
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:33,220
I play too much support.

2465
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:34,760
I can't.

2466
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:43,440
This sucks.

2467
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:49,860
Oh my god.

2468
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:52,400
I swear to god.

2469
01:29:58,760 --> 01:29:59,320
No.

2470
01:29:59,620 --> 01:30:00,160
Where is he?

2471
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:14,060
There we go.

2472
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,600
Stop your stupid fucking tap strafing.

2473
01:30:18,060 --> 01:30:18,620
Like...

2474
01:30:20,360 --> 01:30:21,140
Stop it.

2475
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:22,720
I'm not a controller player.

2476
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,860
Get the fuck out of here with your...

2477
01:30:24,860 --> 01:30:25,640
Tap strafe.

2478
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:26,640
Like...

2479
01:30:29,420 --> 01:30:29,860
Alright.

2480
01:30:30,220 --> 01:30:30,460
Okay.

2481
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:31,980
I did use my teammates as bait.

2482
01:30:32,180 --> 01:30:32,500
Like...

2483
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:32,820
I...

2484
01:30:32,820 --> 01:30:34,040
I did that so I could...

2485
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:34,940
Use him as bait.

2486
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:36,380
Cause I knew he was gonna thirst him.

2487
01:30:36,780 --> 01:30:37,120
I...

2488
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:39,480
I like...

2489
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:41,740
100% knew he was gonna go straight for the thirst.

2490
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:44,560
Umm...

2491
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:45,120
Fuck.

2492
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:46,080
Fuck.

2493
01:30:46,380 --> 01:30:46,860
I don't know.

2494
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:50,160
I don't know what gun to play when I'm in this situation.

2495
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:51,800
I don't...

2496
01:30:53,660 --> 01:30:54,180
Uh...

2497
01:30:54,180 --> 01:30:54,300
Okay.

2498
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:56,880
No.

2499
01:30:57,080 --> 01:30:58,040
He's a movement player.

2500
01:30:58,600 --> 01:30:59,360
I mean...

2501
01:30:59,360 --> 01:30:59,740
I mean...

2502
01:30:59,740 --> 01:31:00,500
Did you see him?

2503
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:03,360
Did you...

2504
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:04,200
I mean...

2505
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:05,200
We all saw that.

2506
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:06,040
He's...

2507
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:06,480
Like...

2508
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:06,740
Yeah.

2509
01:31:06,740 --> 01:31:07,940
He is a movement player.

2510
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:09,980
Oh no.

2511
01:31:09,980 --> 01:31:10,760
I'm starting to shake.

2512
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:11,740
This is not good.

2513
01:31:12,780 --> 01:31:13,160
Ugh.

2514
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:13,640
Fuck.

2515
01:31:13,900 --> 01:31:14,060
Okay.

2516
01:31:14,220 --> 01:31:15,600
I'm actually shaking now.

2517
01:31:15,780 --> 01:31:16,260
My hands.

2518
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:18,220
I hate it when it happens.

2519
01:31:19,580 --> 01:31:20,060
Ugh.

2520
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:23,200
I preemptively gave that to him.

2521
01:31:23,260 --> 01:31:24,380
Because I don't trust him.

2522
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:25,060
To like...

2523
01:31:25,060 --> 01:31:25,720
Not kill himself.

2524
01:31:29,860 --> 01:31:31,060
It's more like...

2525
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:33,640
I just don't trust him to stay alive at this point.

2526
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:36,840
That sucks.

2527
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:37,520
Cause I'm actually...

2528
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:38,560
My hands are actually shaking.

2529
01:31:38,740 --> 01:31:39,400
Which is not good.

2530
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:42,640
Umm...

2531
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:43,400
See I told...

2532
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:44,200
I fucking...

2533
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:45,240
I don't want...

2534
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:48,880
Well...

2535
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:50,000
Light sucks for him I guess.

2536
01:31:53,430 --> 01:31:54,030
There.

2537
01:31:54,210 --> 01:31:55,130
I did that again.

2538
01:32:11,730 --> 01:32:12,730
Fucking idiot.

2539
01:32:15,110 --> 01:32:16,250
Tap strafe more.

2540
01:32:18,130 --> 01:32:20,930
You should have known last round I wasn't a controller player.

2541
01:32:21,410 --> 01:32:22,030
You should have...

2542
01:32:22,030 --> 01:32:22,890
No...

2543
01:32:24,930 --> 01:32:26,190
Tap strafe more.

2544
01:32:26,190 --> 01:32:27,330
Do it.

2545
01:32:27,830 --> 01:32:29,550
I had to deal with time.

2546
01:32:29,870 --> 01:32:31,130
Tap strafe more for me.

2547
01:32:31,590 --> 01:32:32,170
I...

2548
01:32:35,030 --> 01:32:36,170
My goat.

2549
01:32:38,730 --> 01:32:40,550
She's warming up.

2550
01:32:40,870 --> 01:32:42,290
How come it's not...

2551
01:32:42,290 --> 01:32:44,090
How come it's not Battle Royale?

2552
01:32:44,170 --> 01:32:45,430
We're stuck in arena jail.

2553
01:32:45,950 --> 01:32:46,610
For...

2554
01:32:46,610 --> 01:32:47,350
20 more minutes.

2555
01:32:47,350 --> 01:32:48,790
We're really...

2556
01:32:48,790 --> 01:32:49,350
We're gonna...

2557
01:32:50,590 --> 01:32:51,590
move more.

2558
01:32:51,950 --> 01:32:52,850
I'll wait...

2559
01:32:52,850 --> 01:32:53,630
Like...

2560
01:32:53,630 --> 01:32:53,990
Seriously.

2561
01:32:54,390 --> 01:32:55,290
Don't be stupid.

2562
01:32:55,910 --> 01:32:56,470
Like...

2563
01:32:56,470 --> 01:32:57,270
Oh my god.

2564
01:32:57,870 --> 01:32:58,430
God...

2565
01:32:58,430 --> 01:32:58,910
I don't know.

2566
01:32:59,470 --> 01:33:00,790
Baiting people was worth it.

2567
01:33:01,010 --> 01:33:01,670
Maybe I should...

2568
01:33:01,670 --> 01:33:02,930
I should just use Rez to bait.

2569
01:33:03,450 --> 01:33:03,990
I don't know.

2570
01:33:04,250 --> 01:33:05,570
20 more minutes.

2571
01:33:05,930 --> 01:33:06,910
The goat is here.

2572
01:33:07,110 --> 01:33:08,710
With 20 more minutes.

2573
01:33:09,530 --> 01:33:10,410
That's my...

2574
01:33:11,430 --> 01:33:12,870
That's my Oshii.

2575
01:33:16,210 --> 01:33:17,070
Don't worry.

2576
01:33:17,490 --> 01:33:19,610
I'll be free in 20 more minutes.

2577
01:33:20,190 --> 01:33:21,910
I will be free.

2578
01:33:26,370 --> 01:33:30,190
I swear, if I had to play against the... was it Nia?

2579
01:33:30,430 --> 01:33:32,070
That was the tap... oh my god.

2580
01:33:32,510 --> 01:33:34,430
You look so tired.

2581
01:33:34,570 --> 01:33:35,310
Are you okay?

2582
01:33:35,770 --> 01:33:38,890
Did you not see the guy just had to fucking fight?

2583
01:33:38,890 --> 01:33:45,890
It is... I had three hours of sleep and I started stream at 9 in the morning.

2584
01:33:46,490 --> 01:33:50,210
I do not have time to deal with the tapstrapers.

2585
01:33:50,350 --> 01:33:56,070
I... I do not have time.

2586
01:33:56,850 --> 01:33:57,170
I...

2587
01:34:00,930 --> 01:34:02,250
Oh my god.

2588
01:34:03,750 --> 01:34:06,390
I am not here for that.

2589
01:34:06,710 --> 01:34:07,530
Oh wait.

2590
01:34:07,710 --> 01:34:08,550
I'm fighting a dev.

2591
01:34:10,450 --> 01:34:11,630
Dev is in here.

2592
01:34:12,350 --> 01:34:13,470
Guys, be nice.

2593
01:34:15,550 --> 01:34:16,850
I was like...

2594
01:34:16,850 --> 01:34:18,970
Bro, I'm not here for this right now.

2595
01:34:19,350 --> 01:34:20,750
Like, I'm not here for...

2596
01:34:20,750 --> 01:34:21,660
Fucking tapstrapes.

2597
01:34:22,750 --> 01:34:23,810
Bro, I'm tired.

2598
01:34:24,210 --> 01:34:26,030
I'm so tired.

2599
01:34:26,030 --> 01:34:27,110
I...

2600
01:34:27,110 --> 01:34:27,930
Alright.

2601
01:34:28,270 --> 01:34:28,530
I...

2602
01:34:28,530 --> 01:34:28,890
I don't know.

2603
01:34:29,230 --> 01:34:31,990
I don't know what gun to use starting off every time.

2604
01:34:33,310 --> 01:34:35,270
Oh, hook run carbide.

2605
01:34:35,910 --> 01:34:38,650
First round is always the throw away round anyway.

2606
01:34:42,390 --> 01:34:43,510
I mean...

2607
01:34:43,510 --> 01:34:44,970
We go with he the people...

2608
01:34:44,970 --> 01:34:45,610
We the people.

2609
01:34:45,790 --> 01:34:46,570
He's number one.

2610
01:34:46,570 --> 01:34:48,250
I'm not gonna say what I'm gonna say.

2611
01:34:48,970 --> 01:34:50,150
Based off of...

2612
01:34:50,150 --> 01:34:52,410
The last arena fight I had.

2613
01:34:56,940 --> 01:35:00,560
The last arena fight I had was...

2614
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:06,480
Wait, what the fuck?

2615
01:35:07,220 --> 01:35:08,020
What the fuck?

2616
01:35:08,020 --> 01:35:08,680
What the fuck?

2617
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:12,080
I don't know what you're gonna do.

2618
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:12,240
I don't know.

2619
01:35:12,700 --> 01:35:13,420
Okay.

2620
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:16,800
Okay.

2621
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:19,860
There we go.

2622
01:35:20,240 --> 01:35:20,380
Alright.

2623
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:21,520
What was...

2624
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:21,600
What was the...?

2625
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:24,000
It was the mirage fucking resting non-stop.

2626
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:26,920
Like, I'm too tired to find them.

2627
01:35:27,340 --> 01:35:27,560
I'm...

2628
01:35:30,020 --> 01:35:32,620
I'm too tired to find him.

2629
01:35:32,740 --> 01:35:34,720
I'm just like, I can't.

2630
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:41,160
I'll say that the last round, he was Ungabunga.

2631
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:48,860
The last game, I had to go through a catastrophic trauma to clutch it for us.

2632
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:50,140
Let's just say that.

2633
01:35:52,460 --> 01:35:54,800
And he still plays this game.

2634
01:35:55,060 --> 01:35:59,700
I have moved to rivals, and I had to deal with the shit I had to pull.

2635
01:36:00,020 --> 01:36:04,800
The things I had to pull to win us that last game, I... Oh, man.

2636
01:36:05,300 --> 01:36:12,480
With the amount of sleep I got... It was not it for me.

2637
01:36:12,780 --> 01:36:15,140
It was absolutely not it.

2638
01:36:20,350 --> 01:36:21,350
Oh, my God.

2639
01:36:21,370 --> 01:36:22,250
I ego-pushed that.

2640
01:36:22,370 --> 01:36:22,550
Whoops.

2641
01:36:23,370 --> 01:36:24,930
I ego-pushed the hell out of that.

2642
01:36:25,650 --> 01:36:29,390
You better fucking support me after I supported you.

2643
01:36:31,830 --> 01:36:33,250
Oh, my God.

2644
01:36:33,710 --> 01:36:35,730
You better clutch this, people.

2645
01:36:36,270 --> 01:36:38,850
Peeps, you better clutch this afterwards.

2646
01:36:39,390 --> 01:36:41,470
This is my R9 round.

2647
01:36:45,710 --> 01:36:46,470
Okay.

2648
01:36:46,910 --> 01:36:48,350
I'm not ego-peaking.

2649
01:36:48,630 --> 01:36:50,330
I'm not ego-peaking anymore.

2650
01:36:50,870 --> 01:36:51,710
I am.

2651
01:36:52,110 --> 01:36:53,510
But at what cost?

2652
01:36:55,650 --> 01:36:56,510
Oh, no.

2653
01:36:57,810 --> 01:36:58,050
Okay.

2654
01:36:58,810 --> 01:36:58,810
Okay.

2655
01:36:59,050 --> 01:36:59,450
Alright.

2656
01:36:59,850 --> 01:37:00,690
Now I know.

2657
01:37:01,110 --> 01:37:02,070
Now I know.

2658
01:37:02,210 --> 01:37:03,190
I'm not ego-peaking.

2659
01:37:05,130 --> 01:37:05,650
No.

2660
01:37:06,070 --> 01:37:12,550
The one time I won an ego-peak, I had three... I shouldn't have aimed at three people.

2661
01:37:14,970 --> 01:37:17,910
They just look so juicy down there, guys.

2662
01:37:18,190 --> 01:37:20,690
Like, it was... Like, all... They were all grouped up.

2663
01:37:20,710 --> 01:37:21,650
You don't understand.

2664
01:37:22,130 --> 01:37:23,850
They were all grouped up.

2665
01:37:23,970 --> 01:37:29,230
I was like, ooh, look at that juicy shots I can make right now.

2666
01:37:32,730 --> 01:37:33,870
I'll go in this way.

2667
01:37:40,390 --> 01:37:40,790
Okay.

2668
01:37:44,700 --> 01:37:45,700
No, I did it again.

2669
01:37:46,380 --> 01:37:47,140
Oh, my God.

2670
01:37:53,860 --> 01:37:54,660
Jesus Christ.

2671
01:37:54,980 --> 01:37:56,140
Oh, he's right there!

2672
01:37:56,240 --> 01:37:56,760
He was right there!

2673
01:37:57,420 --> 01:37:57,820
Jesus.

2674
01:37:58,040 --> 01:37:58,140
Okay.

2675
01:37:58,380 --> 01:37:58,500
Okay.

2676
01:37:58,740 --> 01:37:59,000
Wait.

2677
01:37:59,200 --> 01:37:59,840
Please look around.

2678
01:38:00,140 --> 01:38:00,820
Oh, my God.

2679
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:01,220
Thank God.

2680
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:01,500
Okay.

2681
01:38:01,660 --> 01:38:02,100
Oh, my God.

2682
01:38:02,180 --> 01:38:02,580
He did it.

2683
01:38:02,680 --> 01:38:02,860
Okay.

2684
01:38:03,020 --> 01:38:03,440
Thank God.

2685
01:38:03,740 --> 01:38:04,840
Oh, he did it.

2686
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:06,320
I got heavily pushed there.

2687
01:38:06,700 --> 01:38:08,000
Oh, my God.

2688
01:38:08,300 --> 01:38:09,300
Oh, thank God.

2689
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:12,260
And, you know, I take back everything I said about last game.

2690
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:12,980
I...

2691
01:38:13,980 --> 01:38:15,460
I take it all back.

2692
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:16,700
You're cool, buddy.

2693
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:17,580
You're cool, man.

2694
01:38:18,100 --> 01:38:18,580
You're...

2695
01:38:20,380 --> 01:38:22,460
Everything I said, I never meant it.

2696
01:38:22,540 --> 01:38:23,540
You're pretty cool.

2697
01:38:27,740 --> 01:38:29,460
I'll use Nemesis again.

2698
01:38:31,140 --> 01:38:31,920
Actually, I can buy...

2699
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:32,660
Oh, I can't.

2700
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:35,100
I don't care about my...

2701
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:37,720
Redemption tour.

2702
01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:38,960
Nice.

2703
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:40,080
I'm the thrower now.

2704
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:42,420
I'm playing, like, not a support anymore.

2705
01:38:42,760 --> 01:38:43,760
I'm, like...

2706
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:44,400
I'm too...

2707
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:46,340
I'm too up in my head now.

2708
01:38:48,580 --> 01:38:49,220
Jesus.

2709
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:50,980
Oh, my God.

2710
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:53,600
I hate U-Till.

2711
01:38:56,820 --> 01:38:59,580
I will never like U-Till.

2712
01:39:01,180 --> 01:39:02,600
U-Till stupid.

2713
01:39:05,020 --> 01:39:05,840
Not one.

2714
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:09,860
I will never like U-Till.

2715
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:13,360
Jesus.

2716
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:18,840
Oh, my God.

2717
01:39:18,980 --> 01:39:19,600
Where is he?

2718
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:21,580
Where is he?

2719
01:39:25,980 --> 01:39:27,580
Where the fuck is he?

2720
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:28,580
Okay, I'm rezzing.

2721
01:39:34,450 --> 01:39:35,430
Okay, I see him.

2722
01:39:40,470 --> 01:39:42,050
They might rezz by either guy.

2723
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:43,970
I'm pretty sure.

2724
01:39:44,570 --> 01:39:47,130
I didn't thirst him, so they're gonna rezz the other guy.

2725
01:39:49,070 --> 01:39:50,030
Jesus Christ.

2726
01:39:50,470 --> 01:39:50,650
Okay.

2727
01:39:51,570 --> 01:39:52,630
That's bad for me.

2728
01:39:54,930 --> 01:39:56,690
They definitely rezzed the other guy, though.

2729
01:39:56,970 --> 01:39:57,950
I won't be surprised.

2730
01:39:59,230 --> 01:39:59,610
Oh, wait.

2731
01:39:59,650 --> 01:39:59,990
No, they didn't.

2732
01:40:00,070 --> 01:40:01,150
He got full thirsted.

2733
01:40:01,230 --> 01:40:01,670
Thank God.

2734
01:40:02,590 --> 01:40:04,970
Thank God he got real full thirsted.

2735
01:40:11,570 --> 01:40:15,520
That was a good flank.

2736
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:18,920
It's fine.

2737
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:20,080
It's fine.

2738
01:40:20,380 --> 01:40:21,220
Ego peeked it.

2739
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:22,480
What's U-Till?

2740
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:23,500
Fucking nades.

2741
01:40:28,420 --> 01:40:29,600
Bro, buddy.

2742
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:32,080
Bro.

2743
01:40:32,780 --> 01:40:33,860
I hit four teams.

2744
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:34,820
I'm sad.

2745
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:40,180
Oh, the fucking 14.

2746
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:42,060
Oh, the classic Mastiff.

2747
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:43,200
14, 14.

2748
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:45,080
Oh, my God.

2749
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:45,580
Okay.

2750
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:49,640
One more arena, and then we'll be in Battle Royale.

2751
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:51,560
Let's go.

2752
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:55,360
I'm not okay.

2753
01:40:55,880 --> 01:40:56,240
All right.

2754
01:40:56,240 --> 01:40:57,500
I'm done playing support.

2755
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:01,960
I'm done supporting these fools.

2756
01:41:02,620 --> 01:41:04,380
I'm so over it.

2757
01:41:05,780 --> 01:41:06,400
All right.

2758
01:41:06,580 --> 01:41:07,220
Let's see.

2759
01:41:07,780 --> 01:41:08,700
I don't know.

2760
01:41:09,080 --> 01:41:10,140
I guess, like...

2761
01:41:10,140 --> 01:41:12,040
I don't even know what to play anymore.

2762
01:41:12,060 --> 01:41:12,960
I don't know what's meta.

2763
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:17,220
I can't do more damage than...

2764
01:41:17,220 --> 01:41:18,440
Yeah, when...

2765
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:18,940
All right.

2766
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:19,760
I'll do Bangalore.

2767
01:41:19,820 --> 01:41:20,460
It's been a while.

2768
01:41:20,740 --> 01:41:22,560
I don't know if smoke's good, though.

2769
01:41:22,820 --> 01:41:26,660
I think, actually, if I can, I want to play Sparrow again.

2770
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:29,560
Um...

2771
01:41:30,440 --> 01:41:31,440
Mirage time.

2772
01:41:31,860 --> 01:41:32,000
Okay.

2773
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:33,980
That Mirage juice were pretty good.

2774
01:41:34,100 --> 01:41:34,820
Not gonna lie.

2775
01:41:35,300 --> 01:41:39,940
The Mirage shit they were doing was, like, pretty fucking tilting.

2776
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:45,920
I just haven't seen Mirage in a long time.

2777
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:49,080
Especially in arena.

2778
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:51,680
And then I was just like, where are they?

2779
01:41:53,160 --> 01:41:54,580
There's more than one...

2780
01:41:54,580 --> 01:41:56,640
Wait, there's supposed to be three people in arena.

2781
01:41:56,840 --> 01:41:57,700
Why is there ten?

2782
01:41:57,960 --> 01:41:58,760
What's up, baby?

2783
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:00,580
I love you.

2784
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:02,320
Why is there ten people?

2785
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:04,820
All right.

2786
01:42:04,980 --> 01:42:05,200
Nice.

2787
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:06,240
Yeah, that's right.

2788
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:07,560
You went getting Sparrow.

2789
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:09,560
That's right.

2790
01:42:10,260 --> 01:42:11,300
How can you say it?

2791
01:42:11,380 --> 01:42:12,320
Like, I love you?

2792
01:42:12,780 --> 01:42:13,140
To...

2793
01:42:13,140 --> 01:42:13,580
Oh, wait.

2794
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:14,100
I was gonna say.

2795
01:42:14,220 --> 01:42:15,980
I thought he was gonna take Ash from him.

2796
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:17,180
I was like...

2797
01:42:17,180 --> 01:42:18,340
He was like, bro, I love you.

2798
01:42:18,420 --> 01:42:19,800
And then he was gonna take his character.

2799
01:42:21,340 --> 01:42:22,740
Lock in Spider-Man.

2800
01:42:22,900 --> 01:42:24,480
And as they give us a super chat, thank you, thanks.

2801
01:42:24,580 --> 01:42:25,040
It's okay.

2802
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:25,700
Peeps...

2803
01:42:25,700 --> 01:42:27,060
Peeps redeemed himself.

2804
01:42:29,440 --> 01:42:30,260
Oh, shit!

2805
01:42:30,660 --> 01:42:31,800
It's another dev!

2806
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:33,440
Oh my god!

2807
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:35,620
It's another dev!

2808
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:36,480
All right, dev.

2809
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:37,760
Oh!

2810
01:42:38,020 --> 01:42:38,980
Okay, it's okay.

2811
01:42:40,140 --> 01:42:41,000
That's fine.

2812
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:42,900
Is Mirage meta now?

2813
01:42:43,060 --> 01:42:43,840
I think so.

2814
01:42:43,940 --> 01:42:44,360
I don't know.

2815
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:45,940
You know what?

2816
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:47,000
My throwaway round.

2817
01:42:47,140 --> 01:42:47,540
Let's go.

2818
01:42:49,640 --> 01:42:50,340
Let's go.

2819
01:42:50,540 --> 01:42:51,560
It's my throwaway round.

2820
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:52,260
I have...

2821
01:42:53,320 --> 01:42:54,180
Let's fuck it.

2822
01:42:54,280 --> 01:42:55,380
I need the iron sight.

2823
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:57,000
I don't know what to do about it.

2824
01:42:57,540 --> 01:42:58,340
Let's go!

2825
01:42:59,860 --> 01:43:01,440
It's my throwaway round.

2826
01:43:02,100 --> 01:43:02,280
Woo!

2827
01:43:04,420 --> 01:43:04,940
Yippee!

2828
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:08,940
And then I can have Battle Royale.

2829
01:43:10,300 --> 01:43:10,840
All right.

2830
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:12,480
Give us that.

2831
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:16,120
I have the bow check.

2832
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:17,160
Oh my gosh.

2833
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:20,120
I wish I could use bow check more, but it's so bad at arena.

2834
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:22,080
I just...

2835
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:23,020
Like, I think, like...

2836
01:43:23,020 --> 01:43:28,380
Because everybody plays such close quarters for arenas that, like, there's no reason to...

2837
01:43:28,380 --> 01:43:29,260
See streamer mode?

2838
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:30,520
I know they're streamers.

2839
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:33,000
Nice.

2840
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:39,120
Jesus Christ, of course.

2841
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:42,080
Oh my God.

2842
01:43:42,380 --> 01:43:43,940
What the fucking...

2843
01:43:43,940 --> 01:43:44,860
What did he have?

2844
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:46,640
What did he have?

2845
01:43:46,900 --> 01:43:47,760
It was so fast.

2846
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:49,240
Oh my God.

2847
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:49,780
I swear to God.

2848
01:43:49,880 --> 01:43:51,860
If you start tap-shrieving, I swear to fucking God.

2849
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:52,500
I...

2850
01:43:57,400 --> 01:43:58,780
I swear to God.

2851
01:43:58,780 --> 01:44:02,100
If I see that man tap-shrieving, I swear...

2852
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:08,480
I was gonna freak out.

2853
01:44:09,020 --> 01:44:09,400
I...

2854
01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:10,100
I...

2855
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:12,820
You tap straight one more time.

2856
01:44:13,320 --> 01:44:14,780
And do that dumbass...

2857
01:44:14,780 --> 01:44:15,200
Okay, look.

2858
01:44:15,320 --> 01:44:15,860
It's cool.

2859
01:44:16,020 --> 01:44:16,400
It's cool.

2860
01:44:16,840 --> 01:44:17,240
I...

2861
01:44:17,240 --> 01:44:18,600
I swear to God.

2862
01:44:19,420 --> 01:44:21,420
Truly stuck in arena hell.

2863
01:44:21,900 --> 01:44:22,300
I...

2864
01:44:22,300 --> 01:44:24,640
I'm not a big fan of arena.

2865
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:26,240
I don't know if you guys noticed that.

2866
01:44:26,620 --> 01:44:27,000
I...

2867
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:28,640
I just like Battle Royale.

2868
01:44:30,460 --> 01:44:33,060
Get me out of this...

2869
01:44:33,060 --> 01:44:34,720
It's getting me out of this prison.

2870
01:44:35,260 --> 01:44:36,960
Get me out...

2871
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:38,280
I just...

2872
01:44:38,280 --> 01:44:39,840
I just wanna...

2873
01:44:40,980 --> 01:44:43,060
I just wanna shoot.

2874
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:44,860
I can't...

2875
01:44:45,720 --> 01:44:46,760
I don't know.

2876
01:44:47,420 --> 01:44:49,080
Wouldn't be funny if...

2877
01:44:49,980 --> 01:44:50,740
Wait.

2878
01:44:50,980 --> 01:44:52,300
Is Peeps gonna be okay?

2879
01:44:54,380 --> 01:44:55,640
Where are they?

2880
01:44:56,540 --> 01:44:58,120
Bro, what the fuck?

2881
01:44:58,440 --> 01:44:58,800
Peeps?

2882
01:45:05,460 --> 01:45:06,320
Let's go.

2883
01:45:13,260 --> 01:45:14,360
Yep, fuck it.

2884
01:45:18,570 --> 01:45:19,170
Alright.

2885
01:45:21,370 --> 01:45:22,590
Oh my God.

2886
01:45:23,790 --> 01:45:24,990
I swear...

2887
01:45:26,730 --> 01:45:28,350
I swear to God.

2888
01:45:29,450 --> 01:45:31,630
I saw that move and shit!

2889
01:45:31,750 --> 01:45:32,750
I was like, I'm going in.

2890
01:45:32,870 --> 01:45:34,230
I'm putting you down.

2891
01:45:34,650 --> 01:45:34,990
Get down!

2892
01:45:38,350 --> 01:45:40,150
I'm putting you down.

2893
01:45:40,370 --> 01:45:43,270
I don't want this shit in my lobby.

2894
01:45:43,530 --> 01:45:44,270
I...

2895
01:45:46,170 --> 01:45:47,850
See what happens.

2896
01:45:48,190 --> 01:45:52,070
The moment I saw one little bit of movement, it's over.

2897
01:45:52,370 --> 01:45:53,710
I'm coming in.

2898
01:45:54,110 --> 01:45:55,270
I mean...

2899
01:45:56,850 --> 01:45:59,450
No movement in this lobby.

2900
01:45:59,450 --> 01:46:01,470
No movement allowed.

2901
01:46:01,530 --> 01:46:02,740
I can't...

2902
01:46:03,230 --> 01:46:04,470
I won't...

2903
01:46:04,470 --> 01:46:05,910
I won't stand for it.

2904
01:46:06,390 --> 01:46:06,830
I...

2905
01:46:06,830 --> 01:46:08,670
He was gearing up.

2906
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:13,950
Alright.

2907
01:46:14,430 --> 01:46:15,710
Oh, is that Fade?

2908
01:46:16,050 --> 01:46:17,630
That's right, Fade.

2909
01:46:18,090 --> 01:46:20,010
This is a no movement zone.

2910
01:46:20,010 --> 01:46:20,850
I...

2911
01:46:23,990 --> 01:46:24,910
I knew it.

2912
01:46:24,990 --> 01:46:25,750
I could tell.

2913
01:46:26,110 --> 01:46:26,670
I could tell.

2914
01:46:26,810 --> 01:46:27,830
It's like, it's one of you guys.

2915
01:46:29,790 --> 01:46:32,190
It's one of you movement streamers.

2916
01:46:32,350 --> 01:46:33,930
I could tell.

2917
01:46:34,870 --> 01:46:36,490
I could smell it.

2918
01:46:39,750 --> 01:46:42,370
I smell the movement in you.

2919
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:49,040
Jesus.

2920
01:46:54,440 --> 01:46:55,540
Just us two.

2921
01:46:57,280 --> 01:46:58,100
Oh my god.

2922
01:46:58,220 --> 01:46:59,160
And they went Gibby too.

2923
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:05,800
Gear them to my left.

2924
01:47:09,310 --> 01:47:10,270
Jesus Christ.

2925
01:47:10,490 --> 01:47:10,730
I'm dead.

2926
01:47:12,810 --> 01:47:13,290
Jesus.

2927
01:47:13,470 --> 01:47:14,150
They're all doing it.

2928
01:47:14,270 --> 01:47:14,830
They're all doing it.

2929
01:47:14,930 --> 01:47:15,710
And I have no cover.

2930
01:47:16,130 --> 01:47:17,310
I had no cover.

2931
01:47:18,170 --> 01:47:19,590
I was stuck here.

2932
01:47:20,330 --> 01:47:21,470
I was stuck.

2933
01:47:21,710 --> 01:47:22,030
It's okay.

2934
01:47:22,030 --> 01:47:22,770
I have my ult here.

2935
01:47:23,750 --> 01:47:24,510
It's alright.

2936
01:47:25,190 --> 01:47:26,050
Oh my god.

2937
01:47:26,650 --> 01:47:28,470
That's because he just goes in.

2938
01:47:28,830 --> 01:47:29,790
With no backup.

2939
01:47:30,590 --> 01:47:34,250
But like, we're against like, players who like, can hold their own.

2940
01:47:35,630 --> 01:47:37,510
So much movement.

2941
01:47:40,730 --> 01:47:42,190
Let me think.

2942
01:47:42,690 --> 01:47:43,350
Okay, obviously.

2943
01:47:43,390 --> 01:47:44,510
I'll take the massive.

2944
01:47:47,230 --> 01:47:49,590
The only way to put down a movement player.

2945
01:47:53,210 --> 01:47:55,050
The only way I know how.

2946
01:47:55,650 --> 01:47:57,310
The only way.

2947
01:48:00,890 --> 01:48:02,750
The only way I know how.

2948
01:48:02,850 --> 01:48:03,290
The only way I know how to do.

2949
01:48:10,210 --> 01:48:12,390
It's unfortunately true.

2950
01:48:13,570 --> 01:48:14,850
These guys are good.

2951
01:48:15,390 --> 01:48:15,910
I mean, they're all.

2952
01:48:16,230 --> 01:48:16,330
They're all.

2953
01:48:24,860 --> 01:48:26,620
Oh, they are asking me.

2954
01:48:30,580 --> 01:48:31,400
Cast it.

2955
01:48:38,580 --> 01:48:39,000
Oh.

2956
01:48:39,620 --> 01:48:40,320
That's not fuck.

2957
01:48:40,460 --> 01:48:40,600
Okay.

2958
01:48:41,960 --> 01:48:42,660
Oh my god.

2959
01:48:42,820 --> 01:48:43,700
Keeps gonna get run at.

2960
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:44,980
Unless.

2961
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:49,660
I hear the res.

2962
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:52,480
Oh my god.

2963
01:48:52,680 --> 01:48:52,840
Fuck.

2964
01:48:53,980 --> 01:48:54,340
Fuck.

2965
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:55,280
Okay, I'm gonna get pushed.

2966
01:48:56,460 --> 01:48:56,740
Nope.

2967
01:49:02,280 --> 01:49:02,700
Nice.

2968
01:49:02,700 --> 01:49:03,100
He got.

2969
01:49:04,260 --> 01:49:04,680
Nice.

2970
01:49:04,840 --> 01:49:05,160
We win.

2971
01:49:06,600 --> 01:49:07,020
Wait.

2972
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:07,900
We don't win?

2973
01:49:12,350 --> 01:49:14,450
The only way I know how.

2974
01:49:16,070 --> 01:49:18,750
This is how you get rid of a movement player.

2975
01:49:25,110 --> 01:49:26,910
Massive is the only way.

2976
01:49:30,090 --> 01:49:31,450
Goodbye movement.

2977
01:49:32,490 --> 01:49:33,170
Goodbye.

2978
01:49:34,570 --> 01:49:36,190
That's my goat.

2979
01:49:39,190 --> 01:49:40,070
All right.

2980
01:49:40,630 --> 01:49:41,570
It's almost time.

2981
01:49:42,190 --> 01:49:43,090
I'm going.

2982
01:49:43,250 --> 01:49:43,730
I'm waiting.

2983
01:49:44,250 --> 01:49:44,990
I'm waiting.

2984
01:49:45,090 --> 01:49:45,730
I can wait.

2985
01:49:46,070 --> 01:49:47,050
I can wait.

2986
01:49:47,510 --> 01:49:49,710
I'm not doing another arena.

2987
01:49:50,030 --> 01:49:51,150
I can wait.

2988
01:49:51,450 --> 01:49:51,790
I can.

2989
01:49:51,970 --> 01:49:52,950
I'm down to wait.

2990
01:49:53,150 --> 01:49:54,630
The next three minutes.

2991
01:49:55,970 --> 01:49:58,490
Strength versus dexterity.

2992
01:49:58,970 --> 01:50:00,210
Goodbye movement.

2993
01:50:04,630 --> 01:50:05,550
We're free.

2994
01:50:05,550 --> 01:50:10,510
I want to know who the fuck was that guy that was trying to tapstrap everywhere in front of me.

2995
01:50:10,690 --> 01:50:11,830
Was that also Fade?

2996
01:50:12,030 --> 01:50:12,710
I do not.

2997
01:50:12,970 --> 01:50:14,730
There was no way that was also Fade.

2998
01:50:15,150 --> 01:50:18,730
I wish I like looked at who it was.

2999
01:50:18,950 --> 01:50:19,390
Oh man.

3000
01:50:20,270 --> 01:50:26,090
I wish I looked at who the fuck that guy was that was doing that fucking bullshit on me.

3001
01:50:26,130 --> 01:50:27,090
I had to.

3002
01:50:27,730 --> 01:50:29,330
Was that also Fade?

3003
01:50:30,470 --> 01:50:40,750
That game where he was doing like one million fucking jumps on me and then I just like tracked him with my shotgun and then he died.

3004
01:50:41,170 --> 01:50:42,510
Who was that guy?

3005
01:50:43,070 --> 01:50:44,310
Does anyone...

3006
01:50:44,310 --> 01:50:44,770
Wait.

3007
01:50:46,030 --> 01:50:47,190
Oh, the last game.

3008
01:50:47,250 --> 01:50:49,290
No, I'm not talking about this game that we just had.

3009
01:50:49,290 --> 01:50:53,550
I'm talking about the game where I put down another movement player with a shotgun.

3010
01:50:53,550 --> 01:50:55,070
That guy.

3011
01:51:01,150 --> 01:51:05,630
I need to know who the fuck that guy was.

3012
01:51:07,010 --> 01:51:08,270
Because that guy.

3013
01:51:08,630 --> 01:51:09,630
Oh my god.

3014
01:51:09,930 --> 01:51:12,630
That guy is living rent free in my head right now.

3015
01:51:12,810 --> 01:51:13,810
He did his job.

3016
01:51:14,010 --> 01:51:15,130
He did his job.

3017
01:51:15,330 --> 01:51:16,230
He wanted people...

3018
01:51:16,230 --> 01:51:20,370
He wanted to have clip moments and he's living rent free in my mind.

3019
01:51:20,370 --> 01:51:21,690
Even though I won.

3020
01:51:21,950 --> 01:51:24,650
I won, but I'm still thinking about him.

3021
01:51:24,990 --> 01:51:26,710
I'm still...

3022
01:51:26,710 --> 01:51:28,850
That shit was bullshit.

3023
01:51:29,370 --> 01:51:31,210
That shit I had to deal with.

3024
01:51:32,010 --> 01:51:32,310
Alright.

3025
01:51:33,490 --> 01:51:35,790
That's a movement player's victory.

3026
01:51:36,330 --> 01:51:36,490
Yeah.

3027
01:51:37,650 --> 01:51:38,150
Yeah.

3028
01:51:38,910 --> 01:51:40,050
He won...

3029
01:51:40,050 --> 01:51:42,510
He won the mental warfare against me.

3030
01:51:42,710 --> 01:51:43,130
Yeah.

3031
01:51:43,930 --> 01:51:44,910
He did.

3032
01:51:45,250 --> 01:51:46,310
I mean, that's all.

3033
01:51:46,650 --> 01:51:47,570
He did.

3034
01:51:47,710 --> 01:51:48,410
He got his...

3035
01:51:48,410 --> 01:51:48,990
He got...

3036
01:51:48,990 --> 01:51:50,350
I won, but...

3037
01:51:50,350 --> 01:51:52,170
I'm still thinking about it.

3038
01:51:53,310 --> 01:51:54,070
I...

3039
01:51:54,870 --> 01:51:56,130
The psycho...

3040
01:51:56,130 --> 01:51:59,130
You never win a psychological battle against movement.

3041
01:51:59,130 --> 01:52:00,450
You never do.

3042
01:52:00,650 --> 01:52:02,210
You're always thinking about it.

3043
01:52:03,610 --> 01:52:04,750
Oh, man.

3044
01:52:05,190 --> 01:52:06,330
I'm not...

3045
01:52:06,330 --> 01:52:08,490
I'm too tired to tap straight.

3046
01:52:08,790 --> 01:52:09,690
I'm too tired.

3047
01:52:09,890 --> 01:52:10,710
I'm literally just...

3048
01:52:10,710 --> 01:52:13,610
I'm fucking getting by with just aim.

3049
01:52:14,390 --> 01:52:15,690
He won...

3050
01:52:15,690 --> 01:52:16,970
You won the battle.

3051
01:52:16,970 --> 01:52:18,490
He won the war.

3052
01:52:18,490 --> 01:52:18,730
He won the war.

3053
01:52:21,190 --> 01:52:21,810
Literally...

3054
01:52:21,810 --> 01:52:25,550
Literally, aim is taking me to the finish line right now.

3055
01:52:26,350 --> 01:52:27,890
Your fingers there.

3056
01:52:28,330 --> 01:52:29,150
No, I...

3057
01:52:29,150 --> 01:52:30,330
I'm just going...

3058
01:52:30,330 --> 01:52:32,130
Going by by pure aim.

3059
01:52:32,430 --> 01:52:34,130
I'm not doing anything fancy.

3060
01:52:34,590 --> 01:52:38,210
Which is very embarrassing for some of the teams I played against today.

3061
01:52:38,210 --> 01:52:39,430
I don't know.

3062
01:52:39,430 --> 01:52:41,550
I don't know about you guys.

3063
01:52:41,850 --> 01:52:42,990
But I had...

3064
01:52:42,990 --> 01:52:49,770
I played against some players who might have been playing this game non-stop and haven't stopped like me.

3065
01:52:49,770 --> 01:52:52,270
And they still got 1v3'd.

3066
01:52:52,290 --> 01:52:53,510
I don't know about you.

3067
01:52:58,090 --> 01:52:59,550
Come on.

3068
01:52:59,570 --> 01:53:00,710
8 players?

3069
01:53:01,410 --> 01:53:01,970
Guys!

3070
01:53:02,510 --> 01:53:04,530
They said 11 a.m.

3071
01:53:04,750 --> 01:53:07,650
Get your ass in my battle royale.

3072
01:53:09,870 --> 01:53:10,750
11...

3073
01:53:10,750 --> 01:53:11,790
Get in here!

3074
01:53:11,790 --> 01:53:14,030
Get in here!

3075
01:53:14,810 --> 01:53:15,730
Get in here!

3076
01:53:16,890 --> 01:53:18,290
There's no way!

3077
01:53:18,550 --> 01:53:21,190
It says 11 to 1.

3078
01:53:21,690 --> 01:53:22,530
It's battle royale.

3079
01:53:22,590 --> 01:53:23,970
I swear to God.

3080
01:53:24,310 --> 01:53:24,850
If I...

3081
01:53:24,850 --> 01:53:27,410
There's no way I missed the battle royale queue.

3082
01:53:27,630 --> 01:53:31,490
I refuse to believe I missed the battle royale queue.

3083
01:53:31,830 --> 01:53:33,110
There is no way!

3084
01:53:35,290 --> 01:53:38,030
They just really, really love arenas, Doki.

3085
01:53:38,370 --> 01:53:39,750
Can you really blame them?

3086
01:53:39,870 --> 01:53:41,730
I swear to God.

3087
01:53:44,990 --> 01:53:48,190
I'm looking at other people's streams and some of them had 22...

3088
01:53:48,190 --> 01:53:49,590
Is it West Coast?

3089
01:53:49,810 --> 01:53:50,510
Is the...

3090
01:53:50,510 --> 01:53:51,250
I swear to God.

3091
01:53:51,410 --> 01:53:52,810
If I swap...

3092
01:53:53,430 --> 01:53:55,230
Why are they moving up?

3093
01:53:55,370 --> 01:53:55,750
Oh my God.

3094
01:53:55,910 --> 01:53:56,510
I'm going to...

3095
01:53:56,510 --> 01:53:58,030
I swear to God.

3096
01:53:58,610 --> 01:53:59,130
Third law.

3097
01:53:59,310 --> 01:54:00,010
Oh my God.

3098
01:54:00,070 --> 01:54:00,450
I swear.

3099
01:54:00,530 --> 01:54:01,270
I'm going East.

3100
01:54:01,490 --> 01:54:02,810
I'm going East Coast.

3101
01:54:02,810 --> 01:54:03,390
Right now.

3102
01:54:03,570 --> 01:54:04,390
There's no way.

3103
01:54:04,690 --> 01:54:06,090
No, I can't even...

3104
01:54:06,090 --> 01:54:06,690
Oh my God.

3105
01:54:07,050 --> 01:54:07,990
There's no way.

3106
01:54:08,130 --> 01:54:08,270
Okay.

3107
01:54:08,490 --> 01:54:08,850
U.S.

3108
01:54:08,890 --> 01:54:09,150
East.

3109
01:54:09,470 --> 01:54:11,750
I'm opening up someone else's stream.

3110
01:54:12,030 --> 01:54:14,390
And then they had 28 players in queue.

3111
01:54:14,830 --> 01:54:15,850
I am...

3112
01:54:15,850 --> 01:54:16,970
I am mad.

3113
01:54:17,370 --> 01:54:19,090
I am mad.

3114
01:54:19,690 --> 01:54:23,630
They have 35 players in their lobby.

3115
01:54:24,070 --> 01:54:25,670
This is not fair.

3116
01:54:25,950 --> 01:54:28,850
This is discrimination against me.

3117
01:54:31,390 --> 01:54:31,990
Alright.

3118
01:54:31,990 --> 01:54:33,430
There's no way.

3119
01:54:33,650 --> 01:54:35,170
Tell me how many players.

3120
01:54:36,170 --> 01:54:37,770
How many...

3121
01:54:37,770 --> 01:54:39,350
How many players?

3122
01:54:39,710 --> 01:54:40,610
Tell me.

3123
01:54:41,610 --> 01:54:42,950
I need to know.

3124
01:54:44,030 --> 01:54:44,790
Please.

3125
01:54:45,310 --> 01:54:46,330
Tell me.

3126
01:54:48,110 --> 01:54:49,550
Nine players?

3127
01:54:49,890 --> 01:54:51,310
Where did they all go?

3128
01:54:52,130 --> 01:54:54,590
What lobby am I in?

3129
01:54:55,410 --> 01:54:58,050
How did they get less players?

3130
01:54:58,050 --> 01:55:00,090
Oh my God.

3131
01:55:00,430 --> 01:55:01,350
I swear.

3132
01:55:01,550 --> 01:55:01,770
Okay.

3133
01:55:01,930 --> 01:55:02,670
I swear to God.

3134
01:55:03,490 --> 01:55:04,090
Maybe...

3135
01:55:04,930 --> 01:55:06,170
Maybe they're in U.S.

3136
01:55:06,230 --> 01:55:06,770
East 1.

3137
01:55:07,110 --> 01:55:09,110
They went back to West Coast.

3138
01:55:09,410 --> 01:55:11,130
They went...

3139
01:55:11,130 --> 01:55:12,670
There's no way.

3140
01:55:14,290 --> 01:55:16,110
Where's my queue?

3141
01:55:17,610 --> 01:55:19,570
Where's my lobby?

3142
01:55:20,790 --> 01:55:21,350
There...

3143
01:55:21,350 --> 01:55:23,290
I'm looking at another person's streamer.

3144
01:55:23,610 --> 01:55:25,410
Start like with another person's POV.

3145
01:55:25,630 --> 01:55:26,930
And it's going up.

3146
01:55:27,490 --> 01:55:28,910
I don't understand.

3147
01:55:29,530 --> 01:55:31,070
How is that possible?

3148
01:55:32,350 --> 01:55:33,030
How...

3149
01:55:33,030 --> 01:55:33,450
How...

3150
01:55:33,450 --> 01:55:34,910
How is that possible?

3151
01:55:37,230 --> 01:55:38,650
Oh my God.

3152
01:55:39,070 --> 01:55:39,930
Am I locked?

3153
01:55:40,190 --> 01:55:41,850
Did they lock me in West Coast?

3154
01:55:42,750 --> 01:55:43,930
I'm sad.

3155
01:55:44,370 --> 01:55:45,830
I'm so sad.

3156
01:55:46,770 --> 01:55:47,730
He looks like...

3157
01:55:47,730 --> 01:55:47,910
No.

3158
01:55:48,170 --> 01:55:49,490
Don't do this to me.

3159
01:55:50,350 --> 01:55:52,070
Don't do this to me.

3160
01:55:52,470 --> 01:55:53,070
How...

3161
01:55:53,070 --> 01:55:58,070
How do they have 39 players in queue and I have 12?

3162
01:55:58,070 --> 01:55:59,430
How?

3163
01:55:59,970 --> 01:56:01,850
They can't do this to me.

3164
01:56:02,150 --> 01:56:04,110
This is all I wanted.

3165
01:56:04,530 --> 01:56:06,230
We haven't...

3166
01:56:06,230 --> 01:56:08,710
Done enough arena matches yet.

3167
01:56:10,450 --> 01:56:12,970
The West Coast Prison.

3168
01:56:13,630 --> 01:56:14,350
No.

3169
01:56:14,970 --> 01:56:15,390
Please.

3170
01:56:15,990 --> 01:56:17,710
Let me be involved.

3171
01:56:18,230 --> 01:56:20,090
I want to be involved.

3172
01:56:20,550 --> 01:56:23,430
I traveled to East Coast for you.

3173
01:56:23,910 --> 01:56:26,010
Let me be involved.

3174
01:56:26,650 --> 01:56:27,330
Please.

3175
01:56:28,550 --> 01:56:31,270
Do you know how much I sacrificed?

3176
01:56:31,730 --> 01:56:34,550
I played two hours of arena.

3177
01:56:35,130 --> 01:56:37,710
This is all I want.

3178
01:56:41,330 --> 01:56:44,570
They can't do this to me.

3179
01:56:45,570 --> 01:56:47,010
I'm going to crush up.

3180
01:56:47,530 --> 01:56:49,170
I'm going to crush up.

3181
01:56:50,230 --> 01:56:51,810
Oh my God.

3182
01:56:53,030 --> 01:56:55,230
It went down.

3183
01:57:00,530 --> 01:57:02,290
It went down.

3184
01:57:02,450 --> 01:57:05,590
It actually went down.

3185
01:57:06,750 --> 01:57:08,270
There's no way.

3186
01:57:09,010 --> 01:57:11,210
There's no fucking way.

3187
01:57:11,730 --> 01:57:13,290
Oh my God.

3188
01:57:13,630 --> 01:57:14,870
It's because they got moved.

3189
01:57:15,210 --> 01:57:16,010
Oh my God.

3190
01:57:16,010 --> 01:57:19,370
They got chosen to be in the other lobby.

3191
01:57:19,870 --> 01:57:21,870
That's not fair.

3192
01:57:22,930 --> 01:57:27,090
They got chosen to be in the other lobby.

3193
01:57:27,850 --> 01:57:30,570
Because the other lobby could...

3194
01:57:30,570 --> 01:57:31,190
Oh my God.

3195
01:57:32,090 --> 01:57:33,250
The other lobby.

3196
01:57:33,530 --> 01:57:36,650
The other lobby got a game.

3197
01:57:36,650 --> 01:57:42,330
And they chose people from my queue to be...

3198
01:57:42,330 --> 01:57:44,570
To go into the other lobby.

3199
01:57:44,570 --> 01:57:46,250
I was not chosen.

3200
01:57:47,090 --> 01:57:48,070
I was not chosen.

3201
01:57:48,070 --> 01:57:49,710
I can't get the shit down.

3202
01:57:53,990 --> 01:57:55,830
Chat are we cooked.

3203
01:57:56,430 --> 01:57:58,490
So thank you for the super chat.

3204
01:57:58,690 --> 01:57:59,150
Thank you.

3205
01:57:59,350 --> 01:57:59,810
Thank you.

3206
01:57:59,950 --> 01:58:01,850
I was not chosen.

3207
01:58:02,530 --> 01:58:03,730
They didn't...

3208
01:58:03,730 --> 01:58:05,950
I'm going back to my homeland.

3209
01:58:05,950 --> 01:58:07,650
And I'm going back.

3210
01:58:08,570 --> 01:58:10,230
Oh my God.

3211
01:58:10,790 --> 01:58:12,710
They didn't pick me.

3212
01:58:14,710 --> 01:58:17,150
Oh my God.

3213
01:58:18,470 --> 01:58:19,530
It's okay.

3214
01:58:19,630 --> 01:58:20,030
I'm okay.

3215
01:58:20,250 --> 01:58:20,610
I'm okay.

3216
01:58:20,810 --> 01:58:21,070
I'm okay.

3217
01:58:21,170 --> 01:58:23,190
The only thing I wish is that...

3218
01:58:23,190 --> 01:58:26,010
I wish that you can...

3219
01:58:26,010 --> 01:58:27,530
You can like...

3220
01:58:27,530 --> 01:58:28,410
Um...

3221
01:58:28,410 --> 01:58:29,410
Do something else.

3222
01:58:29,670 --> 01:58:31,150
While you're in queue.

3223
01:58:31,710 --> 01:58:34,410
That is the one thing I would like to have changed.

3224
01:58:35,550 --> 01:58:39,070
To don't keep complaining too much about arenas.

3225
01:58:39,250 --> 01:58:41,850
So now they are punishing her.

3226
01:58:42,550 --> 01:58:43,090
Don't.

3227
01:58:43,450 --> 01:58:43,630
Please.

3228
01:58:43,910 --> 01:58:45,230
I didn't mean it.

3229
01:58:45,430 --> 01:58:46,270
Oh my God.

3230
01:58:46,410 --> 01:58:46,970
I swear to God.

3231
01:58:47,750 --> 01:58:50,390
Just one Battle Royale game.

3232
01:58:51,210 --> 01:58:51,890
Just...

3233
01:58:51,890 --> 01:58:54,190
One Battle Royale game.

3234
01:58:54,190 --> 01:58:54,890
That's...

3235
01:58:54,890 --> 01:58:56,730
All I ask.

3236
01:58:57,070 --> 01:58:57,510
Please.

3237
01:58:57,910 --> 01:58:58,290
I...

3238
01:58:58,290 --> 01:59:00,590
I don't ask for much.

3239
01:59:01,030 --> 01:59:01,590
I...

3240
01:59:01,590 --> 01:59:02,050
I...

3241
01:59:02,250 --> 01:59:03,790
I don't ask.

3242
01:59:04,150 --> 01:59:05,930
I just want...

3243
01:59:05,930 --> 01:59:07,210
One game.

3244
01:59:07,490 --> 01:59:07,890
Please.

3245
01:59:08,430 --> 01:59:08,910
I...

3246
01:59:08,910 --> 01:59:09,690
I went...

3247
01:59:09,690 --> 01:59:11,410
Are you not entertained?

3248
01:59:11,930 --> 01:59:12,850
Respawn.

3249
01:59:12,950 --> 01:59:14,530
I went through your...

3250
01:59:14,530 --> 01:59:16,350
Your arena jail.

3251
01:59:16,810 --> 01:59:17,390
I...

3252
01:59:17,390 --> 01:59:19,290
I went through it all.

3253
01:59:19,490 --> 01:59:22,610
I went through three different movement players.

3254
01:59:23,050 --> 01:59:23,910
I...

3255
01:59:23,910 --> 01:59:26,190
And I put them down with my shotgun.

3256
01:59:26,950 --> 01:59:27,470
I...

3257
01:59:27,470 --> 01:59:27,850
That's it.

3258
01:59:27,910 --> 01:59:28,870
I'm pulling up bloons.

3259
01:59:31,210 --> 01:59:32,810
We have to reinstall...

3260
01:59:32,810 --> 01:59:32,990
Sorry.

3261
01:59:33,110 --> 01:59:34,470
I uninstalled bloons, guys.

3262
01:59:34,970 --> 01:59:35,810
I need...

3263
01:59:35,810 --> 01:59:35,930
Guys.

3264
01:59:36,010 --> 01:59:36,390
Give me a second.

3265
01:59:36,470 --> 01:59:38,690
Let me reinstall bloons real quick.

3266
01:59:39,070 --> 01:59:41,510
And we might start buffering a little bit.

3267
01:59:41,530 --> 01:59:43,710
Because I'm installing bloons.

3268
01:59:43,710 --> 01:59:48,130
We have nine players in queue.

3269
01:59:49,430 --> 01:59:51,270
Oh, my God.

3270
01:59:52,690 --> 01:59:53,470
Oh.

3271
01:59:54,570 --> 01:59:56,070
Why am I still uninstalled?

3272
01:59:56,110 --> 01:59:57,510
Because I needed space for...

3273
01:59:57,510 --> 01:59:59,730
I needed space for early access.

3274
02:00:00,090 --> 02:00:02,970
So, I was uninstalling everything I have.

3275
02:00:02,970 --> 02:00:05,210
It was 80 gigabytes.

3276
02:00:05,630 --> 02:00:05,810
Okay.

3277
02:00:06,030 --> 02:00:07,430
The early access file.

3278
02:00:08,130 --> 02:00:08,690
All right.

3279
02:00:09,290 --> 02:00:09,810
We're the...

3280
02:00:09,810 --> 02:00:11,030
We have nine players.

3281
02:00:11,370 --> 02:00:12,710
Oh, my God.

3282
02:00:13,410 --> 02:00:16,190
I'm gonna freak out right now.

3283
02:00:16,450 --> 02:00:16,970
All right.

3284
02:00:17,110 --> 02:00:17,530
Let's see.

3285
02:00:20,030 --> 02:00:21,110
All right.

3286
02:00:21,550 --> 02:00:21,910
Yay.

3287
02:00:22,930 --> 02:00:23,670
Yay.

3288
02:00:29,080 --> 02:00:29,980
Let's see.

3289
02:00:30,200 --> 02:00:31,800
Let me figure out where it was.

3290
02:00:32,120 --> 02:00:33,120
Is it gaming?

3291
02:00:35,780 --> 02:00:36,540
All right.

3292
02:00:37,720 --> 02:00:38,660
Let's see.

3293
02:00:40,380 --> 02:00:41,420
Let's see.

3294
02:00:41,540 --> 02:00:47,660
All right.

3295
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:52,620
Just so you can see.

3296
02:00:52,700 --> 02:00:54,100
You still see it.

3297
02:00:54,100 --> 02:00:56,380
How many people are still in queue, at least.

3298
02:00:56,640 --> 02:00:56,840
You know?

3299
02:00:57,220 --> 02:00:58,360
You still see that?

3300
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:01,900
Just put it right...

3301
02:01:01,900 --> 02:01:02,600
Right here.

3302
02:01:04,220 --> 02:01:07,050
So you still see that I am...

3303
02:01:08,440 --> 02:01:09,360
Did it go...

3304
02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:11,220
I'm the fifth player?

3305
02:01:13,540 --> 02:01:14,160
How?

3306
02:01:16,340 --> 02:01:17,540
There's something wrong.

3307
02:01:17,900 --> 02:01:18,460
There has to...

3308
02:01:18,460 --> 02:01:19,720
I'm looking at support center.

3309
02:01:21,700 --> 02:01:22,520
Oh, wait.

3310
02:01:22,700 --> 02:01:23,400
Guys, wait.

3311
02:01:23,400 --> 02:01:24,900
I'm restarting my game.

3312
02:01:25,040 --> 02:01:27,380
There is no way there's five players in queue.

3313
02:01:27,780 --> 02:01:28,960
There is no fucking way.

3314
02:01:29,420 --> 02:01:29,920
I...

3315
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:30,000
Okay.

3316
02:01:30,160 --> 02:01:30,660
Give me a...

3317
02:01:30,660 --> 02:01:30,840
Guys.

3318
02:01:31,020 --> 02:01:31,240
No.

3319
02:01:31,760 --> 02:01:32,420
Give me a sec.

3320
02:01:32,540 --> 02:01:33,600
I'm restarting my game.

3321
02:01:33,780 --> 02:01:34,520
There's no way.

3322
02:01:34,700 --> 02:01:36,080
There's only five players.

3323
02:01:37,560 --> 02:01:39,140
There's no way.

3324
02:01:39,720 --> 02:01:41,740
How am I not get...

3325
02:01:41,740 --> 02:01:43,520
How did it go down?

3326
02:01:44,040 --> 02:01:45,060
How did it...

3327
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:47,660
I'm restarting my game.

3328
02:01:47,660 --> 02:01:49,260
Stop the comm restarting.

3329
02:01:49,380 --> 02:01:49,940
Just in case.

3330
02:01:50,200 --> 02:01:51,760
Just in case, guys.

3331
02:01:53,440 --> 02:01:55,660
You're in losers queue.

3332
02:01:56,460 --> 02:01:56,850
You...

3333
02:01:57,080 --> 02:01:58,060
There's no way.

3334
02:01:58,340 --> 02:01:59,380
Why would they leave?

3335
02:01:59,940 --> 02:02:00,480
Why...

3336
02:02:00,480 --> 02:02:01,500
They said...

3337
02:02:01,500 --> 02:02:03,040
They said 11am.

3338
02:02:03,660 --> 02:02:05,860
We can battle royale.

3339
02:02:05,860 --> 02:02:08,480
They can't do this to me!

3340
02:02:08,820 --> 02:02:10,460
I played their games!

3341
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:15,620
I was a good bird!

3342
02:02:17,600 --> 02:02:21,100
I woke up at 9am for you!

3343
02:02:21,560 --> 02:02:23,540
I was a good bird!

3344
02:02:26,260 --> 02:02:28,500
I did everything right!

3345
02:02:30,580 --> 02:02:33,320
Yeah, it was PSC because...

3346
02:02:33,320 --> 02:02:36,140
I didn't even... Okay.

3347
02:02:36,900 --> 02:02:37,800
There we go.

3348
02:02:38,840 --> 02:02:39,040
Please.

3349
02:02:40,120 --> 02:02:40,600
Please.

3350
02:02:42,360 --> 02:02:43,940
I've been a good boy.

3351
02:02:44,360 --> 02:02:49,180
I've been... I've been a good boy.

3352
02:02:50,520 --> 02:02:51,520
That's all I want.

3353
02:02:51,680 --> 02:02:51,820
Okay.

3354
02:02:52,060 --> 02:02:53,380
Back to Bloons, by the way.

3355
02:02:53,640 --> 02:02:53,940
Alright.

3356
02:02:54,380 --> 02:02:56,600
So we know that... Alright.

3357
02:02:56,840 --> 02:02:57,540
I do!

3358
02:02:57,680 --> 02:02:58,660
I have to restart!

3359
02:02:58,860 --> 02:02:59,560
Oh my god!

3360
02:02:59,780 --> 02:03:02,040
I have to restart!

3361
02:03:02,040 --> 02:03:02,240
Alright!

3362
02:03:02,820 --> 02:03:04,540
I have to... Oh my god!

3363
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:06,580
I'm... I'm okay.

3364
02:03:07,180 --> 02:03:08,280
I'm okay.

3365
02:03:08,700 --> 02:03:10,100
Let's still play Bloons.

3366
02:03:10,640 --> 02:03:11,100
Alright.

3367
02:03:12,380 --> 02:03:12,900
Okay.

3368
02:03:12,900 --> 02:03:13,960
I have to restart.

3369
02:03:14,320 --> 02:03:16,000
I have to fucking restart.

3370
02:03:16,240 --> 02:03:17,040
Who would've thought?

3371
02:03:17,480 --> 02:03:18,600
Oh my god.

3372
02:03:20,280 --> 02:03:20,800
Alright.

3373
02:03:22,720 --> 02:03:26,720
If I knew... If I do, I have to restart.

3374
02:03:27,420 --> 02:03:29,400
I don't know why I keep going.

3375
02:03:29,560 --> 02:03:30,080
I'm sorry.

3376
02:03:30,300 --> 02:03:32,020
I don't know why I keep doing Ice Monk.

3377
02:03:32,040 --> 02:03:32,400
First.

3378
02:03:32,660 --> 02:03:34,240
It's just in my nature.

3379
02:03:34,880 --> 02:03:37,200
It's just in my nature.

3380
02:03:37,700 --> 02:03:38,420
It's just in my nature.

3381
02:03:38,420 --> 02:03:39,860
Just a little banana break.

3382
02:03:40,320 --> 02:03:40,500
Guys.

3383
02:03:42,040 --> 02:03:42,640
Yippee!

3384
02:03:43,160 --> 02:03:45,940
I can afford another monkey.

3385
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:48,900
I just want... Oh wait.

3386
02:03:49,220 --> 02:03:51,920
Let's do a Boomerang.

3387
02:03:52,040 --> 02:03:53,140
Right here.

3388
02:03:53,860 --> 02:03:56,580
And then we can do another Ice Monkey.

3389
02:03:57,040 --> 02:03:58,040
Oh no!

3390
02:03:58,580 --> 02:03:59,540
Oh no!

3391
02:03:59,980 --> 02:04:00,140
Wait.

3392
02:04:01,040 --> 02:04:01,860
No, it's fine.

3393
02:04:01,860 --> 02:04:01,960
Man.

3394
02:04:02,040 --> 02:04:02,400
I believe.

3395
02:04:03,260 --> 02:04:04,080
I believe.

3396
02:04:04,260 --> 02:04:04,400
Oh no!

3397
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:04,400
I believe.

3398
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:04,400
I believe.

3399
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:04,400
I believe.

3400
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:04,400
Nice.

3401
02:04:04,580 --> 02:04:04,720
Okay.

3402
02:04:04,820 --> 02:04:05,460
I've always believed.

3403
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:08,800
I've always believed in you.

3404
02:04:09,460 --> 02:04:09,460
Oh!

3405
02:04:09,660 --> 02:04:11,320
This is a little... Okay.

3406
02:04:11,320 --> 02:04:13,680
Okay, I've always believed in you.

3407
02:04:15,520 --> 02:04:16,600
It's okay.

3408
02:04:18,700 --> 02:04:21,880
We have this guy for the camo.

3409
02:04:23,540 --> 02:04:24,200
There we go.

3410
02:04:25,180 --> 02:04:26,700
I always believe.

3411
02:04:28,280 --> 02:04:30,440
It's okay, I always believe.

3412
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:33,740
Oh my god, I'm in!

3413
02:04:34,100 --> 02:04:36,680
Okay, let's just...

3414
02:04:36,680 --> 02:04:38,780
What the fuck?

3415
02:04:39,100 --> 02:04:50,980
I'm... My team is... Did I just see my team at the bottom of the... There's no way that my team was at the bottom, skill-wise, of the build curve!

3416
02:04:56,020 --> 02:04:59,260
I... I'm scared.

3417
02:04:59,920 --> 02:05:05,040
I saw... I was at the very bottom of the build curve!

3418
02:05:05,040 --> 02:05:07,340
I'm concerned now.

3419
02:05:08,460 --> 02:05:12,120
I literally looked down, and I was like, wait a minute.

3420
02:05:12,460 --> 02:05:15,740
Where am I on the bell curve for the team?

3421
02:05:16,140 --> 02:05:18,620
That's... That's not good news.

3422
02:05:23,330 --> 02:05:25,470
Yeah, but this is a team average.

3423
02:05:25,870 --> 02:05:29,290
Like, who is... There's no way I'm pulling down the team.

3424
02:05:29,750 --> 02:05:37,050
There... I think... How am I pulling down the team average?

3425
02:05:40,470 --> 02:05:41,350
Alright.

3426
02:05:41,350 --> 02:05:42,230
Alright.

3427
02:05:42,230 --> 02:05:42,230
Alright.

3428
02:05:42,230 --> 02:05:42,910
I'm... Okay.

3429
02:05:43,910 --> 02:05:46,290
SPMM is always right.

3430
02:05:46,790 --> 02:05:47,790
Follow the leader!

3431
02:05:48,010 --> 02:05:51,310
I don't have any sense of straighter to my... Bro!

3432
02:05:51,730 --> 02:05:54,430
Did you... I waited so long to play!

3433
02:05:54,850 --> 02:05:57,350
You can't... Oh my god!

3434
02:05:57,970 --> 02:05:58,790
Bro!

3435
02:05:59,770 --> 02:06:02,230
I waited so long!

3436
02:06:04,790 --> 02:06:05,730
Oh my god...

3437
02:06:05,730 --> 02:06:05,730
Waaaay!

3438
02:06:05,730 --> 02:06:05,730
I waited so long!

3439
02:06:05,730 --> 02:06:07,690
Jesus Christ...

3440
02:06:12,530 --> 02:06:13,470
Okay.

3441
02:06:14,050 --> 02:06:14,230
Cool.

3442
02:06:20,790 --> 02:06:21,030
Fuck.

3443
02:06:21,570 --> 02:06:22,030
omg.

3444
02:06:22,330 --> 02:06:23,410
I got hooked.

3445
02:06:26,470 --> 02:06:28,050
I'm so sad.

3446
02:06:28,050 --> 02:06:30,610
Why did you do this to me?

3447
02:06:30,750 --> 02:06:33,390
Why did you do this to me?

3448
02:06:33,610 --> 02:06:34,950
Oh my god!

3449
02:06:35,590 --> 02:06:38,670
I got Prezi's duo stack too!

3450
02:06:40,010 --> 02:06:42,790
Why did you do this to me?

3451
02:06:43,310 --> 02:06:46,950
I don't... Oh my god.

3452
02:06:47,170 --> 02:06:49,450
I got... This is two different teams, by the way.

3453
02:06:49,990 --> 02:06:53,330
This was a different team from Dre's team.

3454
02:06:53,690 --> 02:07:03,110
I got Prezi shooting at me from the side, and then Dre shooting at me from the different side, because it's two... This is a different team right there.

3455
02:07:03,890 --> 02:07:05,570
Oh my god.

3456
02:07:05,810 --> 02:07:07,350
Why did you do this to me?

3457
02:07:07,350 --> 02:07:09,350
Why did my team do this to me?

3458
02:07:09,570 --> 02:07:11,650
Why did he take us to health?

3459
02:07:12,910 --> 02:07:14,810
We're back to the Blues.

3460
02:07:15,270 --> 02:07:18,870
He took us to like two different squads.

3461
02:07:20,330 --> 02:07:20,850
Alright.

3462
02:07:21,110 --> 02:07:22,050
Nice monkey time.

3463
02:07:22,510 --> 02:07:24,530
Nice monkey time.

3464
02:07:25,930 --> 02:07:32,770
You know, I was expecting people to like... I don't know.

3465
02:07:32,910 --> 02:07:36,590
I wasn't expecting there to be where I had to land.

3466
02:07:37,230 --> 02:07:38,550
But that's okay.

3467
02:07:39,790 --> 02:07:40,490
Oh yeah.

3468
02:07:40,530 --> 02:07:41,710
Let me move this now.

3469
02:07:42,930 --> 02:07:46,010
Now... Now we just gotta look at here.

3470
02:07:49,590 --> 02:07:51,410
Time for Ice Monkey again.

3471
02:07:52,490 --> 02:07:53,050
Alright.

3472
02:07:53,330 --> 02:07:54,170
We gotta do this again.

3473
02:07:54,410 --> 02:07:54,570
Oh wait.

3474
02:07:54,690 --> 02:07:55,530
We're over... Oh wait.

3475
02:07:55,990 --> 02:07:56,850
Uh... Yeah.

3476
02:07:56,850 --> 02:07:56,970
Yeah.

3477
02:07:57,270 --> 02:07:58,490
Continue this.

3478
02:07:59,050 --> 02:07:59,890
There we go.

3479
02:08:00,730 --> 02:08:01,130
It's time.

3480
02:08:02,530 --> 02:08:05,670
Bottom of the Belker for a reason.

3481
02:08:06,130 --> 02:08:08,610
It was out of my hands.

3482
02:08:09,190 --> 02:08:11,410
I couldn't do anything.

3483
02:08:12,030 --> 02:08:14,310
It took me to get put down.

3484
02:08:15,990 --> 02:08:20,450
I got put down out of... Not out of my choice.

3485
02:08:23,310 --> 02:08:24,050
Alright.

3486
02:08:25,950 --> 02:08:28,530
In this Ice Monkey time.

3487
02:08:29,590 --> 02:08:29,830
Monkey.

3488
02:08:30,910 --> 02:08:31,950
Monkey.

3489
02:08:32,510 --> 02:08:32,510
Monkey.

3490
02:08:33,530 --> 02:08:34,650
Finally.

3491
02:08:35,310 --> 02:08:35,990
You could've... Yeah.

3492
02:08:36,030 --> 02:08:37,150
With my P20.

3493
02:08:37,470 --> 02:08:38,570
Single P20.

3494
02:08:38,950 --> 02:08:39,930
Let's go.

3495
02:08:41,470 --> 02:08:42,470
Alright.

3496
02:08:43,870 --> 02:08:45,350
Ice Monkey.

3497
02:08:46,610 --> 02:08:48,410
Ice Monkey.

3498
02:08:50,170 --> 02:08:52,870
I'll save up for Gwendolyn later.

3499
02:08:52,870 --> 02:08:54,570
Monkey.

3500
02:08:54,910 --> 02:08:54,910
Monkey.

3501
02:08:57,610 --> 02:08:58,610
Monkey.

3502
02:08:58,610 --> 02:08:59,870
The more you use the Monkey.

3503
02:09:00,070 --> 02:09:02,570
The more upgrades you will unlock using it.

3504
02:09:03,170 --> 02:09:03,990
Monkey.

3505
02:09:05,230 --> 02:09:06,530
That's okay.

3506
02:09:07,210 --> 02:09:09,890
I just need to get Gwendolyn.

3507
02:09:10,490 --> 02:09:11,370
There we go.

3508
02:09:12,690 --> 02:09:13,250
Alright.

3509
02:09:14,290 --> 02:09:15,290
Monkey.

3510
02:09:16,530 --> 02:09:19,610
Now it's upgrade Monkey time.

3511
02:09:21,770 --> 02:09:22,770
Monkey.

3512
02:09:22,770 --> 02:09:23,350
Monkey.

3513
02:09:26,970 --> 02:09:27,530
Monkey.

3514
02:09:31,570 --> 02:09:32,130
Monkey.

3515
02:09:32,930 --> 02:09:32,930
Monkey.

3516
02:09:33,010 --> 02:09:33,030
Monkey.

3517
02:09:34,090 --> 02:09:34,950
Oh shit.

3518
02:09:35,250 --> 02:09:35,410
Okay.

3519
02:09:36,430 --> 02:09:36,990
Wait.

3520
02:09:37,070 --> 02:09:37,750
How do I pause?

3521
02:09:38,430 --> 02:09:38,990
Wait.

3522
02:09:39,350 --> 02:09:39,870
Okay.

3523
02:09:41,910 --> 02:09:42,470
Okay.

3524
02:09:43,050 --> 02:09:43,650
That's fine.

3525
02:09:43,990 --> 02:09:48,510
I'm just gonna put... I... I... I... I know I'm gonna be back in this... In this anyway.

3526
02:09:49,610 --> 02:09:50,170
Alright.

3527
02:09:50,610 --> 02:09:51,090
Guys.

3528
02:09:51,250 --> 02:09:52,690
I don't know what I am on the Belker.

3529
02:09:52,690 --> 02:09:54,570
I... I don't know.

3530
02:09:55,350 --> 02:09:56,270
I don't know.

3531
02:09:56,730 --> 02:09:57,710
You got it.

3532
02:09:57,750 --> 02:09:57,950
Guys.

3533
02:09:58,670 --> 02:09:59,970
I've been through a lot.

3534
02:10:02,830 --> 02:10:03,310
Guys.

3535
02:10:03,310 --> 02:10:04,250
I've been through a lot.

3536
02:10:04,390 --> 02:10:05,210
But we're in it now.

3537
02:10:06,570 --> 02:10:07,410
We're in it.

3538
02:10:07,510 --> 02:10:07,930
Remember.

3539
02:10:08,310 --> 02:10:09,010
Eyes on the prize.

3540
02:10:09,750 --> 02:10:10,230
Alright.

3541
02:10:10,350 --> 02:10:11,730
My frames is... Ooh.

3542
02:10:12,090 --> 02:10:12,970
It's at 144.

3543
02:10:13,130 --> 02:10:13,810
That's alright.

3544
02:10:16,770 --> 02:10:17,250
Alright.

3545
02:10:17,250 --> 02:10:18,010
I'm okay now.

3546
02:10:18,010 --> 02:10:18,390
Guys.

3547
02:10:18,550 --> 02:10:19,330
I won't crash out.

3548
02:10:19,330 --> 02:10:19,690
I swear.

3549
02:10:22,390 --> 02:10:23,290
Dead inside.

3550
02:10:23,530 --> 02:10:23,530
Dead inside.

3551
02:10:23,530 --> 02:10:23,930
That's me.

3552
02:10:25,830 --> 02:10:26,570
That's me.

3553
02:10:26,750 --> 02:10:26,890
That's me.

3554
02:10:26,890 --> 02:10:27,430
Oh my god.

3555
02:10:28,030 --> 02:10:28,590
That's me.

3556
02:10:28,890 --> 02:10:30,210
That's my other self.

3557
02:10:32,450 --> 02:10:34,090
That's playing the game right now.

3558
02:10:37,380 --> 02:10:39,300
I have my... That's my other PC.

3559
02:10:39,600 --> 02:10:40,720
That has the game on.

3560
02:10:43,260 --> 02:10:44,220
Good luck.

3561
02:10:46,200 --> 02:10:46,980
I'm okay.

3562
02:10:48,580 --> 02:10:49,100
Alright.

3563
02:10:49,420 --> 02:10:49,980
Let's see.

3564
02:10:52,020 --> 02:10:52,420
Oh.

3565
02:10:52,560 --> 02:10:53,020
I'll grab that.

3566
02:10:53,160 --> 02:10:53,620
Just in case.

3567
02:10:54,460 --> 02:10:54,740
Oh.

3568
02:10:55,160 --> 02:10:55,960
Let's grab this.

3569
02:11:00,290 --> 02:11:02,090
Let me see if I can find an energy... Oh.

3570
02:11:02,190 --> 02:11:03,030
I forgot I'm a Sparrow.

3571
02:11:03,690 --> 02:11:08,110
See if I can find a... Find a energy gun.

3572
02:11:08,310 --> 02:11:08,910
God damn it.

3573
02:11:09,050 --> 02:11:09,730
I don't need this.

3574
02:11:12,870 --> 02:11:13,270
Oh.

3575
02:11:13,370 --> 02:11:13,610
Fuck.

3576
02:11:13,610 --> 02:11:14,570
I don't want any of these.

3577
02:11:17,070 --> 02:11:17,910
This sucks.

3578
02:11:18,090 --> 02:11:19,550
I don't have the guns I actually really want.

3579
02:11:21,110 --> 02:11:22,130
I have to...

3580
02:11:22,130 --> 02:11:22,910
make sure.

3581
02:11:23,230 --> 02:11:24,830
This is just like... Um.

3582
02:11:25,130 --> 02:11:25,530
Ash.

3583
02:11:25,670 --> 02:11:27,170
Where I don't... Bhop.

3584
02:11:28,410 --> 02:11:29,450
Too much.

3585
02:11:30,030 --> 02:11:35,550
Cause like... Is Eva 8 or Mastiff better?

3586
02:11:35,910 --> 02:11:37,810
People still play... Apex.

3587
02:11:40,210 --> 02:11:41,850
People still play Apex.

3588
02:11:42,410 --> 02:11:47,030
Have they... Have they improved or un... Improved?

3589
02:11:48,250 --> 02:11:50,170
Uh... Eva 8 now?

3590
02:11:50,330 --> 02:11:50,550
Okay.

3591
02:11:50,670 --> 02:11:51,630
Eva 8 is still better.

3592
02:11:51,790 --> 02:11:51,970
Okay.

3593
02:11:51,970 --> 02:11:52,990
That's good to know.

3594
02:11:53,450 --> 02:11:53,970
Alright.

3595
02:11:55,130 --> 02:11:56,430
Is this guy AFK?

3596
02:11:56,650 --> 02:11:57,870
There's no way you're AFK.

3597
02:11:58,270 --> 02:11:59,450
There's no... Oh.

3598
02:11:59,630 --> 02:11:59,630
Oh.

3599
02:11:59,630 --> 02:11:59,830
Oh.

3600
02:11:59,830 --> 02:12:00,690
I was gonna throw him.

3601
02:12:00,910 --> 02:12:01,730
Ha ha ha ha.

3602
02:12:01,910 --> 02:12:03,750
I was gonna throw him into the lava pit.

3603
02:12:03,890 --> 02:12:04,970
To punish him.

3604
02:12:05,350 --> 02:12:05,490
Alright.

3605
02:12:06,050 --> 02:12:06,570
Ha ha ha ha.

3606
02:12:08,910 --> 02:12:11,390
I was ready to punish this man.

3607
02:12:11,930 --> 02:12:13,430
For being AFK.

3608
02:12:14,410 --> 02:12:14,930
No.

3609
02:12:15,210 --> 02:12:15,710
Get an additional.

3610
02:12:16,410 --> 02:12:16,670
Oh.

3611
02:12:16,750 --> 02:12:17,490
I didn't even rework.

3612
02:12:17,750 --> 02:12:19,930
Throwing the speed boost when running towards A mark.

3613
02:12:20,350 --> 02:12:21,090
Get additional tackle.

3614
02:12:21,310 --> 02:12:21,590
Oh.

3615
02:12:21,790 --> 02:12:21,930
Wait.

3616
02:12:21,930 --> 02:12:24,070
This was something I was not reading.

3617
02:12:24,650 --> 02:12:24,690
Oh.

3618
02:12:24,770 --> 02:12:27,830
That's 3 charges that fire fewer pulses in a smaller radius.

3619
02:12:28,490 --> 02:12:31,450
Sparell's help will recover if animals are damaged by his ultimate.

3620
02:12:33,070 --> 02:12:33,510
Mmm.

3621
02:12:34,410 --> 02:12:35,590
I read I have 3 charges.

3622
02:12:35,770 --> 02:12:36,630
3 charges is strong.

3623
02:12:39,110 --> 02:12:39,590
Yeah.

3624
02:12:39,590 --> 02:12:41,410
But I don't have a gold gun that I want to use.

3625
02:12:43,310 --> 02:12:45,150
So I can't do anything yet.

3626
02:12:48,360 --> 02:12:48,840
Oh.

3627
02:12:49,640 --> 02:12:51,360
I have a no attachment.

3628
02:12:52,480 --> 02:12:53,240
No attachment.

3629
02:12:55,740 --> 02:12:56,220
Carbide.

3630
02:12:56,220 --> 02:12:57,460
That's my favorite part.

3631
02:12:59,320 --> 02:13:01,600
Don't you guys love it when your thing has no attachments?

3632
02:13:02,040 --> 02:13:04,080
I want to get that gun so bad.

3633
02:13:04,380 --> 02:13:06,500
But training here doesn't give a fuck.

3634
02:13:13,240 --> 02:13:13,720
Wait.

3635
02:13:13,880 --> 02:13:15,960
I think I can still... Oh.

3636
02:13:16,220 --> 02:13:17,080
I hate no attachments.

3637
02:13:19,340 --> 02:13:19,820
Alright.

3638
02:13:19,820 --> 02:13:20,700
I'm getting this package.

3639
02:13:23,260 --> 02:13:23,700
Sorry.

3640
02:13:23,880 --> 02:13:24,040
Sorry Trini.

3641
02:13:24,920 --> 02:13:26,000
This is more important.

3642
02:13:26,340 --> 02:13:27,340
I'm a loot goblin.

3643
02:13:31,360 --> 02:13:31,800
Okay.

3644
02:13:45,780 --> 02:13:46,340
Oh my god.

3645
02:13:46,460 --> 02:13:46,500
Boy.

3646
02:13:46,580 --> 02:13:47,560
My pathfinder is so far.

3647
02:13:47,780 --> 02:13:48,280
I'm dead.

3648
02:13:53,540 --> 02:13:54,180
I'm dead.

3649
02:13:54,400 --> 02:13:54,540
No.

3650
02:13:54,680 --> 02:13:56,100
My pathfinder was way too far.

3651
02:13:56,500 --> 02:13:58,520
My... Wait.

3652
02:13:58,520 --> 02:13:59,940
I thought he was behind me.

3653
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:00,140
Oh.

3654
02:14:00,240 --> 02:14:00,700
He ran.

3655
02:14:01,560 --> 02:14:02,240
He ran.

3656
02:14:02,240 --> 02:14:03,280
Oh my god.

3657
02:14:03,360 --> 02:14:03,360
Oh my god.

3658
02:14:03,360 --> 02:14:06,100
I didn't realize my pathfinder wasn't playing with me.

3659
02:14:06,480 --> 02:14:12,960
I was like... I still get my upgraded shields now.

3660
02:14:13,180 --> 02:14:13,460
What?

3661
02:14:13,820 --> 02:14:15,140
What are you doing?

3662
02:14:16,580 --> 02:14:18,580
Are you a... I... Wait.

3663
02:14:19,180 --> 02:14:20,400
Just craft us.

3664
02:14:20,580 --> 02:14:21,160
Bro.

3665
02:14:21,500 --> 02:14:22,860
You can craft us.

3666
02:14:23,040 --> 02:14:23,260
Bro.

3667
02:14:25,520 --> 02:14:26,560
What is he?

3668
02:14:27,260 --> 02:14:28,300
Oh my god.

3669
02:14:28,840 --> 02:14:29,960
Are you new?

3670
02:14:30,780 --> 02:14:32,220
I'm at the bottom of the belt.

3671
02:14:32,220 --> 02:14:35,020
I'm at the belt curve.

3672
02:14:35,620 --> 02:14:37,020
I'm at the belt curve.

3673
02:14:37,020 --> 02:14:37,980
I'm at the bottom of the belt curve.

3674
02:14:38,220 --> 02:14:39,220
There's no way.

3675
02:14:39,400 --> 02:14:40,540
This is how this man plays.

3676
02:14:40,720 --> 02:14:41,960
I'm not even watching this.

3677
02:14:42,160 --> 02:14:43,300
I'd be too mad.

3678
02:14:46,740 --> 02:14:48,200
I'd be too mad.

3679
02:14:48,860 --> 02:14:49,260
I'd be too mad.

3680
02:14:49,260 --> 02:14:51,100
I'd honestly be way too mad.

3681
02:14:51,120 --> 02:14:52,360
I'm gonna play flutes.

3682
02:14:52,500 --> 02:14:53,700
I need to calm down.

3683
02:14:54,260 --> 02:14:58,680
I... I need to calm down.

3684
02:14:59,600 --> 02:15:00,040
Alright.

3685
02:15:02,900 --> 02:15:03,480
Okay.

3686
02:15:05,560 --> 02:15:07,820
I don't wanna... Guys, no, you don't understand.

3687
02:15:07,840 --> 02:15:09,380
I do not wanna watch this right now.

3688
02:15:09,660 --> 02:15:13,560
I don't wanna watch him do whatever the fuck he's doing.

3689
02:15:19,480 --> 02:15:20,600
This is fine.

3690
02:15:21,800 --> 02:15:23,440
I am fine with that.

3691
02:15:26,940 --> 02:15:28,640
Red heart, hot range.

3692
02:15:32,780 --> 02:15:33,340
Wait.

3693
02:15:33,560 --> 02:15:34,280
Oh, shit.

3694
02:15:35,740 --> 02:15:36,600
There we go.

3695
02:15:38,280 --> 02:15:40,420
Okay, I should have enough for...

3696
02:15:41,120 --> 02:15:42,340
How much do I need?

3697
02:15:43,400 --> 02:15:44,040
Wait, I'm back.

3698
02:15:44,200 --> 02:15:44,720
Oh, shit.

3699
02:15:44,820 --> 02:15:45,260
I'm back.

3700
02:15:46,960 --> 02:15:47,520
Shit.

3701
02:15:50,860 --> 02:15:51,680
I'm back.

3702
02:15:52,160 --> 02:15:53,000
I'm back.

3703
02:15:53,220 --> 02:15:53,480
Okay.

3704
02:15:54,200 --> 02:15:56,520
I got my stupid ass.

3705
02:15:56,820 --> 02:15:57,700
You're back.

3706
02:15:57,820 --> 02:15:58,360
I'm alive.

3707
02:15:59,000 --> 02:15:59,600
I'm alive.

3708
02:15:59,600 --> 02:16:00,800
It's like I never die.

3709
02:16:01,960 --> 02:16:02,920
It's like...

3710
02:16:04,480 --> 02:16:05,440
Oh, my God.

3711
02:16:05,640 --> 02:16:06,540
He actually did it.

3712
02:16:07,120 --> 02:16:07,860
No, you don't understand.

3713
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,640
If I had to watch this guy play after what I just saw...

3714
02:16:11,400 --> 02:16:13,100
I'm trying not to crash out.

3715
02:16:13,320 --> 02:16:15,780
I'm actually trying so hard not to freak out.

3716
02:16:19,100 --> 02:16:22,360
I had... I had to play Bloons to calm down.

3717
02:16:22,360 --> 02:16:23,420
You don't understand.

3718
02:16:24,180 --> 02:16:29,300
I... I... I would not be okay if like... I had to keep watching him.

3719
02:16:29,540 --> 02:16:30,020
I...

3720
02:16:34,580 --> 02:16:37,180
I... I definitely would not be okay.

3721
02:16:39,820 --> 02:16:42,420
I was doing my best to be a good person.

3722
02:16:42,420 --> 02:16:43,500
All right.

3723
02:16:43,500 --> 02:16:44,000
New kill leader?

3724
02:16:44,500 --> 02:16:44,660
Huh.

3725
02:16:44,960 --> 02:16:45,420
I don't know.

3726
02:16:45,560 --> 02:16:47,040
Sounds like too much pressure for them.

3727
02:16:47,420 --> 02:16:48,820
Replicator incoming, friends.

3728
02:16:49,020 --> 02:16:49,520
Replicator incoming, friends.

3729
02:16:49,520 --> 02:16:50,420
Me on the coughing...

3730
02:16:54,320 --> 02:16:55,480
I'm so sad.

3731
02:16:55,740 --> 02:16:57,420
I had such a nice longbow.

3732
02:16:57,640 --> 02:16:58,860
I wanted to go...

3733
02:16:58,860 --> 02:16:59,420
Pew pew.

3734
02:16:59,700 --> 02:17:02,220
I have zero attachments for this.

3735
02:17:02,240 --> 02:17:03,240
It's actually crazy.

3736
02:17:06,740 --> 02:17:09,000
Oh, I just realized I...

3737
02:17:09,380 --> 02:17:10,620
I lost my...

3738
02:17:11,100 --> 02:17:12,040
Um...

3739
02:17:12,380 --> 02:17:13,900
I lost my...

3740
02:17:13,900 --> 02:17:16,140
Gold energy mag that I was holding.

3741
02:17:16,500 --> 02:17:17,360
God dammit.

3742
02:17:18,620 --> 02:17:19,780
God dammit.

3743
02:17:20,180 --> 02:17:20,560
No.

3744
02:17:21,220 --> 02:17:21,760
No.

3745
02:17:23,400 --> 02:17:24,200
No.

3746
02:17:26,340 --> 02:17:27,140
No.

3747
02:17:28,360 --> 02:17:29,300
Oh, I'm going there.

3748
02:17:30,180 --> 02:17:31,760
I still don't... I don't really need to go.

3749
02:17:33,020 --> 02:17:33,820
Oh!

3750
02:17:35,700 --> 02:17:36,540
No, I...

3751
02:17:36,540 --> 02:17:37,280
I mean like...

3752
02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:37,960
I still haven't found...

3753
02:17:38,940 --> 02:17:39,820
Oh, wait.

3754
02:17:39,960 --> 02:17:40,460
Welcome back.

3755
02:17:40,640 --> 02:17:42,740
I still haven't found any attachments that I need.

3756
02:17:43,840 --> 02:17:44,800
While I was looting.

3757
02:17:45,020 --> 02:17:45,700
That's what I mean.

3758
02:17:45,920 --> 02:17:46,880
Not like...

3759
02:17:46,880 --> 02:17:47,680
Oh, man.

3760
02:17:49,080 --> 02:17:50,460
Why don't I spawn with it?

3761
02:17:50,500 --> 02:17:51,060
Not like that.

3762
02:17:51,200 --> 02:17:52,140
But like more so like...

3763
02:17:52,140 --> 02:17:52,540
I can't be...

3764
02:17:52,540 --> 02:17:53,080
Oh my god.

3765
02:17:53,280 --> 02:17:53,520
Okay.

3766
02:17:53,900 --> 02:17:55,180
I know I just...

3767
02:17:55,180 --> 02:17:56,000
Swap guns.

3768
02:17:56,220 --> 02:17:56,820
But like...

3769
02:17:56,820 --> 02:17:58,820
I rather have a nemesis on my hands.

3770
02:18:00,080 --> 02:18:01,140
In a flat line.

3771
02:18:01,500 --> 02:18:02,700
Oh, is this like...

3772
02:18:02,700 --> 02:18:03,440
Play for yourself?

3773
02:18:03,820 --> 02:18:04,200
Oh, man.

3774
02:18:04,360 --> 02:18:05,180
Just like how...

3775
02:18:05,180 --> 02:18:06,460
I remember Apex.

3776
02:18:06,940 --> 02:18:10,460
Just like how I remember it.

3777
02:18:11,860 --> 02:18:13,360
Goodbye, Trini.

3778
02:18:14,480 --> 02:18:15,040
Goodbye.

3779
02:18:18,610 --> 02:18:19,940
My good old...

3780
02:18:19,940 --> 02:18:22,060
My good old Apex.

3781
02:18:22,840 --> 02:18:24,080
Some things never change.

3782
02:18:25,700 --> 02:18:27,080
I hate putting an iron sight.

3783
02:18:27,280 --> 02:18:28,740
I hate putting a scope on my...

3784
02:18:29,740 --> 02:18:31,400
Where is she going?

3785
02:18:31,800 --> 02:18:32,840
Sounds like too much pressure for you.

3786
02:18:32,840 --> 02:18:33,900
I'm so confused.

3787
02:18:35,520 --> 02:18:35,880
Where...

3788
02:18:35,880 --> 02:18:37,500
What do you wanna do, buddy?

3789
02:18:38,780 --> 02:18:40,660
Do you care about us?

3790
02:18:40,840 --> 02:18:41,860
Are we like...

3791
02:18:41,860 --> 02:18:42,040
Nope.

3792
02:18:42,360 --> 02:18:42,780
Do you...

3793
02:18:42,780 --> 02:18:45,020
Do you want us to be near you?

3794
02:18:45,440 --> 02:18:45,960
Like...

3795
02:18:45,960 --> 02:18:46,920
Like...

3796
02:18:46,920 --> 02:18:47,320
I'm...

3797
02:18:47,320 --> 02:18:48,500
I'm confused.

3798
02:18:49,620 --> 02:18:50,200
Trini...

3799
02:18:50,200 --> 02:18:51,160
Do you want us there?

3800
02:18:51,200 --> 02:18:53,260
Or do you not want us with you?

3801
02:18:53,540 --> 02:18:54,960
I'm so confused.

3802
02:18:57,900 --> 02:18:58,480
She's...

3803
02:18:58,480 --> 02:18:59,800
She's just gone.

3804
02:19:02,020 --> 02:19:02,600
Like...

3805
02:19:02,600 --> 02:19:03,440
Trini...

3806
02:19:03,440 --> 02:19:04,060
I...

3807
02:19:04,060 --> 02:19:04,980
Yeah, there's an enemy?

3808
02:19:05,280 --> 02:19:06,320
You know where we are?

3809
02:19:06,440 --> 02:19:07,580
Not with you!

3810
02:19:08,580 --> 02:19:08,880
Like...

3811
02:19:10,140 --> 02:19:10,740
Trini...

3812
02:19:10,740 --> 02:19:11,800
Oh, now you're running?

3813
02:19:11,940 --> 02:19:12,320
Okay!

3814
02:19:12,740 --> 02:19:14,180
Break up your mind!

3815
02:19:14,520 --> 02:19:16,920
This is why I'm on the bottom of the bell curve.

3816
02:19:17,220 --> 02:19:18,040
This is...

3817
02:19:19,420 --> 02:19:22,680
This feels like bottom of the bell curve right now.

3818
02:19:22,920 --> 02:19:25,460
They are moving like a goddamn unit.

3819
02:19:25,460 --> 02:19:26,820
And then...

3820
02:19:34,220 --> 02:19:35,980
This sucks because they have high ground up here.

3821
02:19:36,760 --> 02:19:37,780
Are you okay?

3822
02:19:41,360 --> 02:19:41,800
Okay.

3823
02:19:45,520 --> 02:19:46,220
Oh, there they are.

3824
02:19:51,180 --> 02:19:51,620
Okay.

3825
02:19:53,220 --> 02:19:54,140
I'll take that.

3826
02:19:59,370 --> 02:20:00,250
Jesus Christ.

3827
02:20:00,450 --> 02:20:01,050
Oh, and this guy.

3828
02:20:06,320 --> 02:20:07,420
Oh my god.

3829
02:20:09,380 --> 02:20:10,620
Are you s...

3830
02:20:18,670 --> 02:20:19,770
Oh my god!

3831
02:20:20,350 --> 02:20:21,030
I...

3832
02:20:21,030 --> 02:20:21,850
I...

3833
02:20:21,850 --> 02:20:23,710
At least I kill a praise.

3834
02:20:24,770 --> 02:20:25,930
I don't...

3835
02:20:25,930 --> 02:20:28,190
I don't know what my team was doing.

3836
02:20:28,770 --> 02:20:29,150
I...

3837
02:20:29,150 --> 02:20:31,870
I don't know what my team was doing.

3838
02:20:32,690 --> 02:20:33,030
I...

3839
02:20:33,030 --> 02:20:34,410
I don't...

3840
02:20:34,970 --> 02:20:35,430
I...

3841
02:20:35,730 --> 02:20:36,370
I don't...

3842
02:20:36,970 --> 02:20:37,350
I...

3843
02:20:37,350 --> 02:20:37,870
I...

3844
02:20:37,870 --> 02:20:38,450
I don't...

3845
02:20:39,290 --> 02:20:42,030
I don't know what my team was doing.

3846
02:20:42,590 --> 02:20:43,110
I...

3847
02:20:43,110 --> 02:20:43,490
I...

3848
02:20:44,710 --> 02:20:45,470
I...

3849
02:20:45,470 --> 02:20:46,170
I...

3850
02:20:49,330 --> 02:20:50,090
I...

3851
02:20:50,890 --> 02:20:52,210
I literally...

3852
02:20:52,210 --> 02:20:53,910
That's a 1v3 that...

3853
02:20:54,430 --> 02:20:55,190
I...

3854
02:20:59,610 --> 02:21:01,170
Oh my god!

3855
02:21:01,750 --> 02:21:03,670
I look so lost!

3856
02:21:04,610 --> 02:21:06,630
Oh, I forgot my streamer mode.

3857
02:21:06,790 --> 02:21:08,370
Aw, all those cool plays I did.

3858
02:21:08,370 --> 02:21:09,630
They don't know it was me.

3859
02:21:10,190 --> 02:21:12,110
And they'll never know.

3860
02:21:12,530 --> 02:21:13,590
It was me.

3861
02:21:14,270 --> 02:21:14,890
Doki.

3862
02:21:18,390 --> 02:21:19,710
I'll take it off.

3863
02:21:20,470 --> 02:21:22,010
Okay, I'll take off streamer mode.

3864
02:21:23,110 --> 02:21:23,730
Uh...

3865
02:21:23,730 --> 02:21:24,350
There you go.

3866
02:21:25,150 --> 02:21:26,730
Yeah, you look tired.

3867
02:21:27,450 --> 02:21:27,830
Um...

3868
02:21:27,830 --> 02:21:29,580
With what I just had to do...

3869
02:21:29,950 --> 02:21:32,550
With the team I had...

3870
02:21:32,550 --> 02:21:33,290
I...

3871
02:21:33,290 --> 02:21:35,190
There's a reason why I was tired.

3872
02:21:36,710 --> 02:21:37,630
It's okay.

3873
02:21:37,630 --> 02:21:39,270
I'm in my safe place now.

3874
02:21:39,630 --> 02:21:40,290
I...

3875
02:21:40,290 --> 02:21:40,910
I...

3876
02:21:43,610 --> 02:21:44,270
I...

3877
02:21:44,270 --> 02:21:45,350
I'm sorry, Doki.

3878
02:21:45,470 --> 02:21:46,410
It was me.

3879
02:21:49,450 --> 02:21:50,590
Oh, man.

3880
02:21:54,310 --> 02:21:54,970
Alright.

3881
02:21:55,990 --> 02:21:56,590
It's fine.

3882
02:21:56,730 --> 02:21:58,770
Oh, I have enough for a helicopter.

3883
02:21:58,850 --> 02:21:59,850
It's time.

3884
02:22:01,130 --> 02:22:02,090
It's time.

3885
02:22:02,330 --> 02:22:03,010
Boom, boom.

3886
02:22:03,390 --> 02:22:04,150
There you go.

3887
02:22:04,150 --> 02:22:05,150
Which one was...

3888
02:22:05,150 --> 02:22:06,070
Camo?

3889
02:22:06,310 --> 02:22:06,910
I forgot.

3890
02:22:07,390 --> 02:22:08,310
I forgot.

3891
02:22:08,590 --> 02:22:11,070
I don't remember which one was Camo.

3892
02:22:11,510 --> 02:22:12,970
Which one goes to Camo?

3893
02:22:13,090 --> 02:22:13,930
Second or third?

3894
02:22:14,690 --> 02:22:16,350
Guys, second or third?

3895
02:22:17,310 --> 02:22:18,330
Back to the middle?

3896
02:22:18,550 --> 02:22:18,850
Okay.

3897
02:22:19,150 --> 02:22:19,710
There we go.

3898
02:22:19,890 --> 02:22:21,250
Back to my happy place.

3899
02:22:21,430 --> 02:22:21,930
Where...

3900
02:22:21,930 --> 02:22:23,970
Nothing bad can happen to me.

3901
02:22:28,650 --> 02:22:31,670
Nothing bad will happen to me here.

3902
02:22:33,430 --> 02:22:34,050
Alright.

3903
02:22:34,250 --> 02:22:34,810
Here we go.

3904
02:22:35,990 --> 02:22:36,450
Alright.

3905
02:22:36,690 --> 02:22:37,530
Enhance freeze.

3906
02:22:37,850 --> 02:22:38,490
There you go.

3907
02:22:40,270 --> 02:22:41,190
It's fine.

3908
02:22:41,430 --> 02:22:42,450
We still have time.

3909
02:22:42,770 --> 02:22:44,110
We still have time, guys.

3910
02:22:44,290 --> 02:22:44,830
It's okay.

3911
02:22:45,720 --> 02:22:47,250
We have so much time.

3912
02:22:48,830 --> 02:22:49,890
I believe.

3913
02:22:52,530 --> 02:22:53,050
Wait.

3914
02:22:54,230 --> 02:22:55,370
Do I get to play Sparrow?

3915
02:22:55,510 --> 02:22:56,690
I do not get to play Sparrow.

3916
02:22:56,830 --> 02:22:57,310
Oh my god.

3917
02:22:57,530 --> 02:22:57,670
Okay.

3918
02:22:58,290 --> 02:22:58,390
Wait.

3919
02:22:58,490 --> 02:22:59,210
I'll play Conduit.

3920
02:22:59,630 --> 02:22:59,890
Alright.

3921
02:23:00,390 --> 02:23:00,890
That's fine.

3922
02:23:01,490 --> 02:23:02,650
Back to my happy place.

3923
02:23:05,970 --> 02:23:06,490
Alright.

3924
02:23:07,770 --> 02:23:08,730
This is okay.

3925
02:23:09,230 --> 02:23:11,690
I can buy another helicopter.

3926
02:23:12,890 --> 02:23:13,930
And then...

3927
02:23:13,930 --> 02:23:14,170
Come on.

3928
02:23:14,850 --> 02:23:15,370
425.

3929
02:23:16,070 --> 02:23:16,590
Alright.

3930
02:23:18,270 --> 02:23:19,010
That's fine.

3931
02:23:19,890 --> 02:23:20,370
Okay.

3932
02:23:21,620 --> 02:23:22,290
I'm happy.

3933
02:23:22,450 --> 02:23:22,710
Okay.

3934
02:23:23,210 --> 02:23:24,350
Oh shit.

3935
02:23:24,650 --> 02:23:24,810
Okay.

3936
02:23:25,970 --> 02:23:26,630
I...

3937
02:23:27,390 --> 02:23:28,470
I don't know.

3938
02:23:28,690 --> 02:23:30,290
Who are these people in my team?

3939
02:23:30,510 --> 02:23:31,650
I don't know.

3940
02:23:32,150 --> 02:23:32,770
I...

3941
02:23:37,090 --> 02:23:39,470
I don't know who these people are anymore.

3942
02:23:39,670 --> 02:23:40,490
I'm so...

3943
02:23:40,490 --> 02:23:42,150
I'm like...

3944
02:23:42,150 --> 02:23:43,850
I don't know anyone anymore.

3945
02:23:44,350 --> 02:23:44,810
I...

3946
02:23:44,810 --> 02:23:46,110
I don't know.

3947
02:23:48,530 --> 02:23:50,310
My heart of touch, guys!

3948
02:23:53,510 --> 02:23:54,650
Guys, I think...

3949
02:23:54,650 --> 02:23:56,450
From that last game I had to go through.

3950
02:23:56,590 --> 02:23:58,130
Anyone would be in my situation.

3951
02:23:59,130 --> 02:24:00,110
Anyone would...

3952
02:24:00,110 --> 02:24:01,430
Would react the way I did.

3953
02:24:01,670 --> 02:24:02,270
When I...

3954
02:24:02,270 --> 02:24:02,650
What...

3955
02:24:02,650 --> 02:24:03,710
I had to go through there.

3956
02:24:04,330 --> 02:24:07,070
When I saw my Pathfinder fucking run.

3957
02:24:07,990 --> 02:24:19,810
When... In the first sight of trouble... When there was like... When I knocked one person down... Anyone will react that.

3958
02:24:20,250 --> 02:24:20,630
Like that.

3959
02:24:23,290 --> 02:24:30,310
Top 5 reasonable... It's only a natural reaction to the hell I was given.

3960
02:24:34,520 --> 02:24:35,400
Okay.

3961
02:24:39,560 --> 02:24:40,440
Alright.

3962
02:24:40,440 --> 02:24:40,600
Alright.

3963
02:24:41,960 --> 02:24:45,720
I think it's also cause like... Dango.

3964
02:24:46,020 --> 02:24:47,200
Thank you for the super chat.

3965
02:24:47,360 --> 02:24:47,560
Thank you.

3966
02:24:47,740 --> 02:24:48,220
Thank you.

3967
02:24:49,640 --> 02:24:53,440
A lot of them really good players are also like 3 stacking too.

3968
02:24:53,660 --> 02:24:55,280
Or duo or 3 stacking.

3969
02:24:55,740 --> 02:24:57,980
So like it makes it harder for me.

3970
02:24:59,620 --> 02:25:01,680
Since my poor... Oh my god.

3971
02:25:01,720 --> 02:25:02,580
Why are you over here?

3972
02:25:03,600 --> 02:25:04,960
Why are you so far?

3973
02:25:08,640 --> 02:25:09,540
Are you okay?

3974
02:25:10,760 --> 02:25:12,360
I'm always scared going here.

3975
02:25:12,980 --> 02:25:13,900
As a solo.

3976
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:16,660
I just don't trust my team.

3977
02:25:18,800 --> 02:25:20,740
I have trust issues in this game.

3978
02:25:22,400 --> 02:25:23,360
Anyone would.

3979
02:25:24,720 --> 02:25:25,240
Honestly.

3980
02:25:25,500 --> 02:25:26,840
Anyone would have trust issues.

3981
02:25:26,960 --> 02:25:29,920
If you don't have trust issues... You have been stacking for way too long.

3982
02:25:34,260 --> 02:25:37,180
You have lived your life... Stacking.

3983
02:25:40,280 --> 02:25:41,480
I trust them.

3984
02:25:41,540 --> 02:25:42,460
They will come and come.

3985
02:25:42,480 --> 02:25:42,900
Clutch.

3986
02:25:45,060 --> 02:25:45,860
Where are they?

3987
02:25:46,240 --> 02:25:46,740
Where are they?

3988
02:25:48,300 --> 02:25:48,580
Where are they?

3989
02:25:48,580 --> 02:25:49,220
It's already a res?

3990
02:25:50,060 --> 02:25:51,200
What the fuck?

3991
02:25:55,480 --> 02:25:58,260
These guys are gonna... Checking... What?

3992
02:26:00,520 --> 02:26:01,000
Okay.

3993
02:26:01,500 --> 02:26:03,060
My guy wants to fight that.

3994
02:26:03,360 --> 02:26:05,980
But there's a guy... There's a team to our right though.

3995
02:26:06,140 --> 02:26:06,960
So I'm like... Really?

3996
02:26:07,200 --> 02:26:07,660
Are you sure?

3997
02:26:07,860 --> 02:26:08,100
Okay.

3998
02:26:21,760 --> 02:26:23,040
I only got the Gibby.

3999
02:26:23,160 --> 02:26:27,960
I couldn't get the... Oh my god.

4000
02:26:28,100 --> 02:26:29,000
He's movementing.

4001
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:37,880
I couldn't.

4002
02:26:37,960 --> 02:26:38,680
I don't have Q.

4003
02:26:40,380 --> 02:26:41,500
I'm gonna... Oh.

4004
02:26:42,160 --> 02:26:42,640
Demo.

4005
02:26:42,720 --> 02:26:43,160
Nice.

4006
02:26:43,580 --> 02:26:44,000
Alright.

4007
02:26:44,440 --> 02:26:44,980
These guys.

4008
02:26:45,100 --> 02:26:46,040
I don't know who they are.

4009
02:26:46,240 --> 02:26:48,840
I must be... I am definitely not...

4010
02:26:48,840 --> 02:26:49,880
with it.

4011
02:26:50,120 --> 02:26:53,300
With the times of like... The current... Content Creators.

4012
02:26:53,520 --> 02:26:54,760
But they know what they're doing.

4013
02:26:55,040 --> 02:26:56,260
And that's... Alright.

4014
02:26:56,280 --> 02:26:57,140
By my hands.

4015
02:26:58,340 --> 02:26:58,780
Healing.

4016
02:26:58,780 --> 02:27:00,200
They knew what they were doing guys.

4017
02:27:00,500 --> 02:27:02,340
And at that point... Like... I take that.

4018
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:04,420
I don't know who they are.

4019
02:27:04,440 --> 02:27:05,780
But they are good players.

4020
02:27:07,760 --> 02:27:08,740
They can fight.

4021
02:27:08,940 --> 02:27:09,420
Oh my god.

4022
02:27:09,500 --> 02:27:12,480
From what I just went through before... At least they can fight.

4023
02:27:15,820 --> 02:27:17,260
I don't ask for much.

4024
02:27:20,930 --> 02:27:22,910
A great team in my solos.

4025
02:27:23,430 --> 02:27:25,510
I meant like... content... Apex Content Creators.

4026
02:27:25,590 --> 02:27:26,450
Cause I don't... Or players.

4027
02:27:26,570 --> 02:27:27,790
I don't recognize any of them.

4028
02:27:29,010 --> 02:27:31,110
So like... Oh, I don't wanna... Actually?

4029
02:27:31,810 --> 02:27:32,550
Fuck it.

4030
02:27:33,170 --> 02:27:33,710
Let's go.

4031
02:27:34,670 --> 02:27:35,810
This might be bad.

4032
02:27:37,690 --> 02:27:39,510
This might be very bad.

4033
02:27:40,470 --> 02:27:40,550
This might be very bad.

4034
02:27:40,550 --> 02:27:41,030
This might be very bad.

4035
02:27:41,030 --> 02:27:42,050
I'm not good at 3x though.

4036
02:27:45,240 --> 02:27:45,620
Alright.

4037
02:27:48,720 --> 02:27:50,080
I don't recognize him.

4038
02:27:50,320 --> 02:27:50,820
Is it OX5?

4039
02:27:51,080 --> 02:27:52,140
I don't recognize him.

4040
02:27:53,660 --> 02:27:54,340
And they are EU.

4041
02:27:54,720 --> 02:27:55,840
Never seen him before.

4042
02:27:56,160 --> 02:27:56,960
In my lobbies.

4043
02:27:58,020 --> 02:27:59,760
To be fair, I haven't played rank in a while though.

4044
02:28:04,540 --> 02:28:06,580
If it's EU, then I'm like... Oh, okay.

4045
02:28:07,800 --> 02:28:09,880
I mean, it's just one sliver of health.

4046
02:28:09,880 --> 02:28:10,000
It's just one sliver of health.

4047
02:28:11,780 --> 02:28:12,180
Woo!

4048
02:28:14,360 --> 02:28:16,800
No, it's not as good as people think it is.

4049
02:28:17,100 --> 02:28:17,480
I don't know.

4050
02:28:17,620 --> 02:28:19,260
I personally don't think it's like that great.

4051
02:28:20,040 --> 02:28:22,240
It feels like the same old...

4052
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:24,720
Same old, same old type...

4053
02:28:24,720 --> 02:28:25,720
Oh wait, I need that.

4054
02:28:26,440 --> 02:28:26,840
Uh...

4055
02:28:26,840 --> 02:28:27,540
That's too far.

4056
02:28:27,980 --> 02:28:29,140
Wait, I need this.

4057
02:28:33,420 --> 02:28:34,700
Yeah, I don't recognize him.

4058
02:28:34,760 --> 02:28:35,800
So I was like...

4059
02:28:35,800 --> 02:28:35,940
Who?

4060
02:28:39,380 --> 02:28:40,260
I need bats.

4061
02:28:41,060 --> 02:28:42,080
Did I get that right?

4062
02:28:43,500 --> 02:28:44,500
Wait, can I...

4063
02:28:44,500 --> 02:28:45,940
Oh, I can enhance but we'll check.

4064
02:28:46,140 --> 02:28:46,400
Nice.

4065
02:28:48,360 --> 02:28:48,880
Nice.

4066
02:28:51,820 --> 02:28:52,340
Oh.

4067
02:28:53,240 --> 02:28:54,160
There he is.

4068
02:28:56,360 --> 02:28:57,580
I mean, he seems...

4069
02:28:57,580 --> 02:28:57,940
He's good.

4070
02:28:58,580 --> 02:29:00,500
I'm happy that he's good.

4071
02:29:00,720 --> 02:29:02,740
Finally, I'm past the bell curve, guys.

4072
02:29:02,740 --> 02:29:05,060
I finally did it.

4073
02:29:05,780 --> 02:29:07,780
I'm so happy to see you at this time.

4074
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:08,540
Tired girl.

4075
02:29:08,780 --> 02:29:11,140
Yasmin, thank you for the super chat.

4076
02:29:11,540 --> 02:29:12,100
Thank you.

4077
02:29:12,320 --> 02:29:12,920
Thank you.

4078
02:29:13,460 --> 02:29:14,260
Thank you.

4079
02:29:14,380 --> 02:29:15,040
I'm glad...

4080
02:29:15,680 --> 02:29:18,540
I'm glad you guys are happy to see me too.

4081
02:29:23,480 --> 02:29:23,760
Alright.

4082
02:29:23,760 --> 02:29:25,920
We have beat the bell curve.

4083
02:29:26,480 --> 02:29:26,980
We have beat the bell curve.

4084
02:29:26,980 --> 02:29:27,600
We finally did it.

4085
02:29:27,860 --> 02:29:28,160
We finally did it.

4086
02:29:28,160 --> 02:29:30,020
After the last two teams we've done...

4087
02:29:30,020 --> 02:29:30,920
The...

4088
02:29:30,920 --> 02:29:33,060
The game has decided to give me my one.

4089
02:29:33,620 --> 02:29:35,400
If we could find the players.

4090
02:29:36,360 --> 02:29:38,640
I'm gonna say that and then we're gonna get like...

4091
02:29:38,640 --> 02:29:40,660
1, 2, 3'd by a whole fucking team.

4092
02:29:44,890 --> 02:29:45,450
Oh.

4093
02:29:45,950 --> 02:29:46,510
They're fighting.

4094
02:29:47,210 --> 02:29:48,650
They're fighting in zone.

4095
02:29:48,650 --> 02:29:50,210
I don't wanna deal with that.

4096
02:29:50,650 --> 02:29:51,170
Really.

4097
02:29:51,890 --> 02:29:53,110
Cause I don't...

4098
02:29:54,090 --> 02:29:55,330
Oh, he's right there.

4099
02:30:00,460 --> 02:30:01,060
Oh.

4100
02:30:03,280 --> 02:30:04,860
That was a huge crack though.

4101
02:30:04,980 --> 02:30:05,580
Not gonna lie.

4102
02:30:06,120 --> 02:30:07,300
You should push that.

4103
02:30:09,200 --> 02:30:09,800
Nice.

4104
02:30:10,120 --> 02:30:12,060
I literally naded all of them there.

4105
02:30:15,320 --> 02:30:15,620
Yay.

4106
02:30:17,880 --> 02:30:18,840
I saw them.

4107
02:30:18,960 --> 02:30:20,000
I mean, they were stupid.

4108
02:30:20,180 --> 02:30:21,620
They literally opened the door.

4109
02:30:22,840 --> 02:30:24,300
To my nade.

4110
02:30:25,200 --> 02:30:26,380
That's on them.

4111
02:30:26,580 --> 02:30:26,920
Honestly.

4112
02:30:28,600 --> 02:30:30,260
That was actually on them.

4113
02:30:33,220 --> 02:30:33,780
Alright.

4114
02:30:34,660 --> 02:30:35,220
Yippee.

4115
02:30:38,100 --> 02:30:39,280
That was like...

4116
02:30:39,280 --> 02:30:40,100
Open that door.

4117
02:30:40,520 --> 02:30:41,360
They're like, okay.

4118
02:30:45,400 --> 02:30:46,960
I mean, I'll take it.

4119
02:30:47,440 --> 02:30:47,680
Oh.

4120
02:30:49,140 --> 02:30:49,920
What did he dib?

4121
02:30:50,440 --> 02:30:51,980
I don't know what he dibbed.

4122
02:30:53,940 --> 02:30:54,580
I don't know what he dibbed.

4123
02:30:55,060 --> 02:30:56,140
I'll take that then.

4124
02:30:58,080 --> 02:30:59,500
I was like, what did he dib?

4125
02:31:00,020 --> 02:31:00,800
Should I be polite?

4126
02:31:01,060 --> 02:31:01,600
I don't know.

4127
02:31:01,600 --> 02:31:02,120
Why?

4128
02:31:04,720 --> 02:31:05,740
No, I'm not talking.

4129
02:31:06,060 --> 02:31:07,460
I don't have push to talk bind.

4130
02:31:09,660 --> 02:31:10,540
Because like...

4131
02:31:10,540 --> 02:31:12,380
I never talk to randoms.

4132
02:31:12,380 --> 02:31:15,160
If I talk to randoms, all they'll do is disappoint me.

4133
02:31:17,520 --> 02:31:21,580
But like, you know, sometimes I get the rare chance that they don't disappoint me.

4134
02:31:21,580 --> 02:31:22,680
You know?

4135
02:31:23,540 --> 02:31:24,020
You know?

4136
02:31:24,020 --> 02:31:24,800
Sometimes they...

4137
02:31:24,800 --> 02:31:25,520
They don't.

4138
02:31:25,620 --> 02:31:28,140
And it makes me like, a little happier in life.

4139
02:31:28,540 --> 02:31:29,340
But like...

4140
02:31:29,340 --> 02:31:31,880
That's not enough for me to unbind...

4141
02:31:31,880 --> 02:31:33,280
To rebind my push to talk.

4142
02:31:33,860 --> 02:31:34,340
That's...

4143
02:31:36,100 --> 02:31:40,700
If I give them a bit of attention, all they do is just gonna make me sad.

4144
02:31:46,200 --> 02:31:47,840
All I'm saying is that...

4145
02:31:48,440 --> 02:31:49,940
I will not...

4146
02:31:49,940 --> 02:31:50,340
Like...

4147
02:31:50,340 --> 02:31:54,020
Even if it was the 1% where I don't get sad...

4148
02:31:54,020 --> 02:31:56,480
It's too much effort for just one guy.

4149
02:31:58,260 --> 02:32:00,300
Wait, maybe I can swap my bow check.

4150
02:32:01,220 --> 02:32:02,280
Oh, it doesn't.

4151
02:32:02,460 --> 02:32:03,020
It's still 40.

4152
02:32:03,320 --> 02:32:04,840
I thought I was being really clever.

4153
02:32:05,100 --> 02:32:05,860
Where like...

4154
02:32:06,540 --> 02:32:09,220
I swap my bow check for maybe more ammo.

4155
02:32:09,940 --> 02:32:11,060
But like...

4156
02:32:11,540 --> 02:32:12,860
I wasn't being clever.

4157
02:32:13,800 --> 02:32:14,720
Ha ha ha ha.

4158
02:32:19,460 --> 02:32:20,020
Well...

4159
02:32:27,480 --> 02:32:28,040
Where?

4160
02:32:29,920 --> 02:32:31,040
I don't...

4161
02:32:31,940 --> 02:32:33,240
I don't see them.

4162
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,380
Oh my god, they're all like...

4163
02:32:42,160 --> 02:32:43,720
Jesus Christ, I have to go down.

4164
02:32:48,700 --> 02:32:49,500
I'm waiting.

4165
02:32:51,480 --> 02:32:53,900
I'm gonna nade this after this is down.

4166
02:32:54,320 --> 02:32:55,240
Just in case.

4167
02:32:58,020 --> 02:32:59,240
I see them.

4168
02:33:06,440 --> 02:33:07,020
Oh.

4169
02:33:08,240 --> 02:33:08,980
Coming up.

4170
02:33:11,320 --> 02:33:12,420
Where are they?

4171
02:33:12,620 --> 02:33:14,840
I'm like so confused as to where they are.

4172
02:33:18,300 --> 02:33:18,880
Jesus.

4173
02:33:19,180 --> 02:33:20,340
I was like, where are they?

4174
02:33:21,720 --> 02:33:22,200
Okay.

4175
02:33:22,200 --> 02:33:23,400
I got so confused.

4176
02:33:23,780 --> 02:33:24,760
Yeah, reveal my position.

4177
02:33:24,760 --> 02:33:25,760
I don't fucking care.

4178
02:33:26,380 --> 02:33:27,420
Ha ha ha ha.

4179
02:33:28,940 --> 02:33:30,480
Oh my god, I'm lagging here.

4180
02:33:32,640 --> 02:33:33,700
There you go, he's in.

4181
02:33:34,500 --> 02:33:35,300
Oh my...

4182
02:33:35,300 --> 02:33:36,880
Guys, I might have to close bloons.

4183
02:33:37,340 --> 02:33:37,700
Ha ha ha.

4184
02:33:37,860 --> 02:33:39,500
I might have to close bloons.

4185
02:33:40,360 --> 02:33:40,840
I'm...

4186
02:33:40,840 --> 02:33:42,140
My frames are dropping.

4187
02:33:42,140 --> 02:33:43,020
I...

4188
02:33:43,020 --> 02:33:44,220
Ha ha ha ha.

4189
02:33:44,560 --> 02:33:45,760
Ha ha ha ha.

4190
02:33:46,640 --> 02:33:47,060
Ha ha ha ha.

4191
02:33:47,180 --> 02:33:48,880
I don't know if you saw that.

4192
02:33:49,460 --> 02:33:49,980
But...

4193
02:33:49,980 --> 02:33:50,480
Ha ha ha.

4194
02:33:50,480 --> 02:33:54,140
I think it was not a good idea to have two games open.

4195
02:33:54,520 --> 02:33:55,600
Oh my god.

4196
02:33:55,800 --> 02:33:56,980
Oh, that frame drop.

4197
02:33:57,480 --> 02:33:58,460
Ha ha ha ha.

4198
02:33:59,600 --> 02:34:00,120
Ha ha ha.

4199
02:34:00,120 --> 02:34:01,720
Not a good time for me, guys.

4200
02:34:02,800 --> 02:34:02,820
Ha ha ha.

4201
02:34:03,480 --> 02:34:03,840
Ha ha ha.

4202
02:34:04,440 --> 02:34:05,140
There's this.

4203
02:34:05,560 --> 02:34:06,560
I hate...

4204
02:34:06,560 --> 02:34:08,160
Guys, give me a sec.

4205
02:34:08,280 --> 02:34:10,080
Let me close the bloons.

4206
02:34:10,440 --> 02:34:11,180
Oh my...

4207
02:34:11,180 --> 02:34:12,460
Did you guys see the...

4208
02:34:12,460 --> 02:34:14,420
Did you guys see the frame drop?

4209
02:34:15,060 --> 02:34:15,980
Ha ha ha ha.

4210
02:34:17,440 --> 02:34:18,740
I was like, whoops.

4211
02:34:20,240 --> 02:34:21,680
Wait, close A.

4212
02:34:21,940 --> 02:34:23,430
Just close Apex Toki.

4213
02:34:24,260 --> 02:34:24,980
Ha ha ha.

4214
02:34:26,340 --> 02:34:27,640
I was like, wait.

4215
02:34:27,800 --> 02:34:29,500
This doesn't look too good.

4216
02:34:31,100 --> 02:34:32,280
What is he doing?

4217
02:34:32,480 --> 02:34:32,720
Here.

4218
02:34:33,720 --> 02:34:35,840
Demo, you don't have to do that.

4219
02:34:35,960 --> 02:34:36,320
Just here.

4220
02:34:37,600 --> 02:34:38,080
Okay.

4221
02:34:41,180 --> 02:34:41,600
Ugh.

4222
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:43,180
Put this on just in case.

4223
02:34:47,460 --> 02:34:48,140
Oh no.

4224
02:34:48,300 --> 02:34:49,240
What's gonna be there?

4225
02:34:49,320 --> 02:34:50,360
You betrayed ice.

4226
02:34:54,500 --> 02:34:55,280
Oh my god.

4227
02:34:55,500 --> 02:34:56,220
Please don't look.

4228
02:34:57,080 --> 02:34:57,880
Jesus, guys.

4229
02:34:58,000 --> 02:34:58,520
Please don't look.

4230
02:34:58,660 --> 02:34:59,400
I can't hit.

4231
02:34:59,700 --> 02:35:00,840
Bro check right now.

4232
02:35:09,840 --> 02:35:10,640
Oh my god.

4233
02:35:10,780 --> 02:35:11,220
I can't.

4234
02:35:11,340 --> 02:35:11,640
No!

4235
02:35:11,840 --> 02:35:12,600
There's too many.

4236
02:35:12,840 --> 02:35:13,860
Guys, don't look.

4237
02:35:14,260 --> 02:35:15,340
Don't look.

4238
02:35:15,340 --> 02:35:17,220
I can't phone check right now.

4239
02:35:17,400 --> 02:35:17,860
No!

4240
02:35:18,340 --> 02:35:18,780
I can't.

4241
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:20,380
Ha ha ha ha.

4242
02:35:21,540 --> 02:35:21,640
Ha ha ha ha.

4243
02:35:21,640 --> 02:35:22,060
The fuck?

4244
02:35:23,240 --> 02:35:25,520
All the FBS gain for this.

4245
02:35:26,080 --> 02:35:27,000
Oh my god.

4246
02:35:27,340 --> 02:35:28,600
I'm fucking washed.

4247
02:35:28,640 --> 02:35:29,860
I can't phone check.

4248
02:35:30,040 --> 02:35:33,520
I waited so long just to not be able to phone check.

4249
02:35:33,800 --> 02:35:35,960
I should have left bloons on.

4250
02:35:36,220 --> 02:35:36,800
I shouldn't use...

4251
02:35:36,800 --> 02:35:37,480
Oh, it's Olympus.

4252
02:35:37,600 --> 02:35:38,860
I'm gonna use the bathroom real quick, guys.

4253
02:35:39,120 --> 02:35:40,120
I'll be right back.

4254
02:35:40,120 --> 02:35:43,940
I hit my vault shots from 50 miles away.

4255
02:35:44,280 --> 02:35:46,180
And then I can't hit a bow check shot.

4256
02:35:46,520 --> 02:35:47,920
What happened to me?

4257
02:35:48,140 --> 02:35:48,700
I'll be right back.

4258
02:35:48,800 --> 02:35:49,800
I'll use the bathroom though.

4259
02:36:47,860 --> 02:36:48,300
Guys.

4260
02:36:49,100 --> 02:36:50,260
No more bow check.

4261
02:36:50,600 --> 02:36:50,880
Ha ha.

4262
02:36:51,440 --> 02:36:51,880
Unless...

4263
02:36:51,880 --> 02:36:52,920
Unless it was the scope.

4264
02:36:53,020 --> 02:36:53,740
I'm gonna start coping.

4265
02:36:54,080 --> 02:36:55,340
It's the scope, guys.

4266
02:36:55,760 --> 02:36:57,160
Ha ha ha ha.

4267
02:36:57,740 --> 02:36:58,180
Ha ha ha ha.

4268
02:36:58,180 --> 02:36:58,440
Ha ha ha.

4269
02:36:59,000 --> 02:36:59,420
Ha ha ha.

4270
02:36:59,420 --> 02:36:59,560
Ha ha ha.

4271
02:36:59,980 --> 02:37:01,680
It's because of the scope, guys.

4272
02:37:01,760 --> 02:37:02,480
No, you don't understand.

4273
02:37:02,780 --> 02:37:04,940
I'm not used to 2x on the bow check.

4274
02:37:04,940 --> 02:37:06,060
I'm gonna start coping.

4275
02:37:06,280 --> 02:37:07,540
Ha ha ha.

4276
02:37:07,880 --> 02:37:08,800
It will be...

4277
02:37:08,800 --> 02:37:10,800
It will be different next time.

4278
02:37:11,220 --> 02:37:12,260
It will be different.

4279
02:37:12,880 --> 02:37:13,080
Ha ha ha.

4280
02:37:13,620 --> 02:37:14,260
It's fine.

4281
02:37:14,380 --> 02:37:14,620
I'm gonna...

4282
02:37:14,620 --> 02:37:15,300
I'm gonna put...

4283
02:37:15,300 --> 02:37:16,520
I'm gonna get a bow check again.

4284
02:37:16,840 --> 02:37:17,680
And then...

4285
02:37:17,680 --> 02:37:18,560
And I'm gonna...

4286
02:37:18,560 --> 02:37:21,000
I'm gonna put no scope on the bow check.

4287
02:37:21,160 --> 02:37:22,460
And then I'm gonna hit every shot.

4288
02:37:22,700 --> 02:37:23,200
Trust me.

4289
02:37:26,540 --> 02:37:27,060
I'm...

4290
02:37:27,060 --> 02:37:28,160
I'm just gonna start coping.

4291
02:37:28,920 --> 02:37:29,340
Um...

4292
02:37:29,340 --> 02:37:30,500
Ha ha ha ha.

4293
02:37:32,720 --> 02:37:33,240
It's...

4294
02:37:33,240 --> 02:37:34,420
It's how...

4295
02:37:34,420 --> 02:37:35,180
That's it.

4296
02:37:35,300 --> 02:37:35,740
That's it.

4297
02:37:36,640 --> 02:37:38,080
It's never me.

4298
02:37:38,880 --> 02:37:40,420
It's never me.

4299
02:37:44,740 --> 02:37:45,540
That's right.

4300
02:37:45,920 --> 02:37:46,620
Open a pack.

4301
02:37:46,760 --> 02:37:47,080
You're right.

4302
02:37:47,260 --> 02:37:48,260
If I open...

4303
02:37:48,260 --> 02:37:50,500
These packs don't transfer over, by the way.

4304
02:37:50,540 --> 02:37:51,220
You guys know that.

4305
02:37:51,740 --> 02:37:54,000
These packs don't transfer over.

4306
02:37:54,220 --> 02:37:54,920
I'm opening them.

4307
02:37:55,160 --> 02:37:56,680
I literally have everything.

4308
02:37:56,920 --> 02:37:59,440
Wait, I have every skin unlocked, too.

4309
02:37:59,920 --> 02:38:06,580
Like, I just realized I should have every skin unlocked because it's an early access account.

4310
02:38:07,600 --> 02:38:08,320
Wait, do I?

4311
02:38:08,460 --> 02:38:09,680
Yeah, I was like, wait a minute.

4312
02:38:09,760 --> 02:38:12,140
I don't even need to open packs.

4313
02:38:12,160 --> 02:38:13,400
What are you talking about?

4314
02:38:14,180 --> 02:38:16,880
I never even needed to open them.

4315
02:38:17,740 --> 02:38:18,440
All right, what am I?

4316
02:38:18,500 --> 02:38:20,440
There's me on the bell.

4317
02:38:20,580 --> 02:38:21,980
Oh my god, no!

4318
02:38:23,060 --> 02:38:24,080
It's you!

4319
02:38:29,240 --> 02:38:30,260
I'm sorry.

4320
02:38:30,560 --> 02:38:31,640
I can't.

4321
02:38:32,320 --> 02:38:36,200
I legitimately cannot play with that guy again.

4322
02:38:36,200 --> 02:38:37,320
I...

4323
02:38:43,260 --> 02:38:43,960
I...

4324
02:38:43,960 --> 02:38:44,460
I'm sorry.

4325
02:38:44,720 --> 02:38:47,060
I actually cannot play with that guy again.

4326
02:38:47,580 --> 02:38:48,180
I...

4327
02:38:49,560 --> 02:38:50,260
I...

4328
02:38:50,260 --> 02:38:50,540
I...

4329
02:38:50,540 --> 02:38:52,100
I would not...

4330
02:38:52,100 --> 02:38:53,380
I would not make it.

4331
02:38:54,060 --> 02:38:54,760
I...

4332
02:38:57,020 --> 02:38:58,700
It's the Pathfinder.

4333
02:38:58,920 --> 02:39:00,980
I cannot play with that Pathfinder again.

4334
02:39:01,640 --> 02:39:02,240
I...

4335
02:39:07,710 --> 02:39:11,950
There's a line on that bell curve that you should not cry for.

4336
02:39:16,550 --> 02:39:18,230
I don't think...

4337
02:39:18,230 --> 02:39:20,210
I don't think he has enough time to learn.

4338
02:39:20,450 --> 02:39:23,750
I don't think he has enough time.

4339
02:39:25,890 --> 02:39:26,930
All right, guys.

4340
02:39:27,210 --> 02:39:28,890
I'm sorry, but...

4341
02:39:28,890 --> 02:39:31,130
No, if you were watching that game...

4342
02:39:31,950 --> 02:39:35,950
If you were watching that game where he showed up...

4343
02:39:35,950 --> 02:39:37,030
I...

4344
02:39:38,050 --> 02:39:39,290
I just...

4345
02:39:39,290 --> 02:39:40,350
You don't understand.

4346
02:39:44,550 --> 02:39:46,350
You don't understand.

4347
02:39:47,210 --> 02:39:47,890
I'm...

4348
02:39:47,890 --> 02:39:49,510
I'm just not strong enough.

4349
02:39:49,710 --> 02:39:50,210
I'm sorry.

4350
02:39:50,230 --> 02:39:52,070
I'm not strong enough for that.

4351
02:39:53,090 --> 02:39:54,670
I wish I was.

4352
02:39:55,030 --> 02:39:56,170
But sadly, I'm not.

4353
02:40:00,770 --> 02:40:02,130
We don't...

4354
02:40:02,130 --> 02:40:03,210
You'll understand.

4355
02:40:05,050 --> 02:40:06,770
No, you'll understand.

4356
02:40:07,110 --> 02:40:08,330
No, you'll understand.

4357
02:40:08,470 --> 02:40:09,470
He was...

4358
02:40:09,470 --> 02:40:11,550
He was playing his own game.

4359
02:40:11,710 --> 02:40:12,350
Let me say.

4360
02:40:12,870 --> 02:40:13,910
He was...

4361
02:40:13,910 --> 02:40:16,830
He was playing his own game there.

4362
02:40:16,990 --> 02:40:18,490
He was not playing with us.

4363
02:40:18,490 --> 02:40:21,730
He was simply in his own little world.

4364
02:40:27,010 --> 02:40:27,810
It's okay.

4365
02:40:27,990 --> 02:40:28,710
We can wait.

4366
02:40:28,990 --> 02:40:30,430
I am willing to wait.

4367
02:40:32,910 --> 02:40:34,430
I am willing to wait.

4368
02:40:37,470 --> 02:40:38,290
It's okay.

4369
02:40:39,130 --> 02:40:40,670
My team is doing it.

4370
02:40:40,810 --> 02:40:41,910
And I've always believed.

4371
02:40:43,770 --> 02:40:44,830
Oh my god.

4372
02:40:45,070 --> 02:40:46,950
Okay, you know how like...

4373
02:40:46,950 --> 02:40:49,190
Okay, before we go... Okay, what about...

4374
02:40:49,190 --> 02:40:50,870
Okay, we're getting rid of you.

4375
02:40:51,310 --> 02:40:52,990
And we're getting rid of you.

4376
02:40:53,510 --> 02:40:55,350
And then we're getting rid of you.

4377
02:40:57,290 --> 02:40:58,370
What if...

4378
02:41:02,630 --> 02:41:03,710
What if...

4379
02:41:06,510 --> 02:41:08,950
What if it was just all...

4380
02:41:10,390 --> 02:41:12,350
What if we can do this?

4381
02:41:13,070 --> 02:41:15,090
Surely this is not a bad idea.

4382
02:41:16,070 --> 02:41:16,610
Surely...

4383
02:41:20,830 --> 02:41:23,490
Surely this isn't a bad idea, guys.

4384
02:41:26,190 --> 02:41:27,490
Surely it isn't.

4385
02:41:27,810 --> 02:41:30,070
As long as we keep believing...

4386
02:41:30,070 --> 02:41:31,130
It will work.

4387
02:41:32,670 --> 02:41:33,230
Okay.

4388
02:41:34,510 --> 02:41:35,950
Oh shit, it's fine.

4389
02:41:36,570 --> 02:41:37,810
Wait, can I play...

4390
02:41:38,410 --> 02:41:39,270
It's fine.

4391
02:41:39,510 --> 02:41:39,890
It's fine.

4392
02:41:40,430 --> 02:41:41,670
Wait, can I play Sparrow?

4393
02:41:42,650 --> 02:41:44,610
Wait, let me see if I can play Sparrow.

4394
02:41:44,610 --> 02:41:45,850
Oh, I...

4395
02:41:45,850 --> 02:41:46,030
Oh.

4396
02:41:46,750 --> 02:41:47,390
Come on.

4397
02:41:47,610 --> 02:41:48,250
Oh, nice.

4398
02:41:48,510 --> 02:41:48,990
Okay.

4399
02:41:49,550 --> 02:41:49,850
Alright.

4400
02:41:50,090 --> 02:41:50,750
See, I told you.

4401
02:41:50,890 --> 02:41:51,270
It's fine.

4402
02:41:52,330 --> 02:41:54,510
And then I'll give him a little hat too.

4403
02:41:56,170 --> 02:41:56,750
Yay.

4404
02:42:00,570 --> 02:42:01,150
Alright.

4405
02:42:02,250 --> 02:42:02,830
Nice.

4406
02:42:04,130 --> 02:42:05,610
And then what if...

4407
02:42:07,350 --> 02:42:08,770
Oh my god, please.

4408
02:42:08,970 --> 02:42:09,190
Okay.

4409
02:42:09,610 --> 02:42:10,990
I'm sorry, Bloons.

4410
02:42:10,990 --> 02:42:12,330
I'm sorry.

4411
02:42:12,530 --> 02:42:13,590
I need frames.

4412
02:42:13,830 --> 02:42:15,450
I need frames.

4413
02:42:16,730 --> 02:42:17,570
I'm sorry.

4414
02:42:17,850 --> 02:42:18,110
Alright.

4415
02:42:18,410 --> 02:42:19,390
It's not him.

4416
02:42:19,650 --> 02:42:20,870
I didn't see the bell curve.

4417
02:42:20,870 --> 02:42:23,470
So we'll never know how disappointed I should be.

4418
02:42:23,970 --> 02:42:24,490
I...

4419
02:42:24,490 --> 02:42:26,410
We'll never know.

4420
02:42:27,570 --> 02:42:28,810
We'll never know.

4421
02:42:33,870 --> 02:42:34,470
Alright.

4422
02:42:35,070 --> 02:42:35,990
That's fine.

4423
02:42:36,810 --> 02:42:37,830
Enough lining around.

4424
02:42:37,910 --> 02:42:38,390
We dropping.

4425
02:42:41,920 --> 02:42:43,780
Guys, don't say that, please.

4426
02:42:43,780 --> 02:42:44,680
I don't...

4427
02:42:45,880 --> 02:42:48,840
Maybe the bell curve wasn't that bad.

4428
02:42:50,260 --> 02:42:53,140
Maybe it wasn't all that bad, guys.

4429
02:42:53,520 --> 02:42:54,780
It could be...

4430
02:42:55,700 --> 02:42:57,160
We could have hope.

4431
02:43:04,860 --> 02:43:06,080
Are you serious?

4432
02:43:06,620 --> 02:43:07,160
I...

4433
02:43:07,160 --> 02:43:07,760
I just...

4434
02:43:10,220 --> 02:43:11,160
Oh my god.

4435
02:43:11,240 --> 02:43:11,840
They have nades.

4436
02:43:12,120 --> 02:43:13,880
They have nades already.

4437
02:43:18,740 --> 02:43:21,440
Go through movement plays right off the bat.

4438
02:43:21,440 --> 02:43:22,100
I...

4439
02:43:24,580 --> 02:43:26,380
What the fuck?

4440
02:43:26,940 --> 02:43:28,520
Yeah, I guess.

4441
02:43:29,840 --> 02:43:32,760
The server shut down.

4442
02:43:33,800 --> 02:43:34,320
Okay.

4443
02:43:34,580 --> 02:43:35,240
It's fine.

4444
02:43:36,120 --> 02:43:36,580
It's fine.

4445
02:43:38,340 --> 02:43:40,060
Did it lose?

4446
02:43:41,180 --> 02:43:42,360
Did it lose?

4447
02:43:47,720 --> 02:43:50,580
I stopped my bloons for this?

4448
02:43:52,860 --> 02:43:54,000
What the fuck?

4449
02:43:54,260 --> 02:43:55,580
I don't know who you are.

4450
02:43:59,820 --> 02:44:00,500
Bro.

4451
02:44:01,680 --> 02:44:02,280
I...

4452
02:44:02,280 --> 02:44:04,280
I guess we go back to bloons.

4453
02:44:04,840 --> 02:44:04,920
Yeah.

4454
02:44:07,700 --> 02:44:10,000
I guess we go back.

4455
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:12,220
Never punish!

4456
02:44:12,720 --> 02:44:15,860
It never happened because the server shut down.

4457
02:44:17,880 --> 02:44:18,280
It's fine.

4458
02:44:19,760 --> 02:44:19,900
Alright.

4459
02:44:20,140 --> 02:44:20,780
Back where...

4460
02:44:20,780 --> 02:44:21,940
Back where we started.

4461
02:44:24,660 --> 02:44:27,080
Will I ever cross the bell curve?

4462
02:44:27,280 --> 02:44:29,960
Find out next time on Dragon Ball Z.

4463
02:44:31,200 --> 02:44:31,920
Alright.

4464
02:44:35,160 --> 02:44:37,760
And then we'll put them here.

4465
02:44:39,100 --> 02:44:40,420
And then...

4466
02:44:40,420 --> 02:44:40,720
Large.

4467
02:44:41,980 --> 02:44:43,420
And then...

4468
02:44:43,420 --> 02:44:45,560
And freeze for longer.

4469
02:44:46,580 --> 02:44:47,620
That's fine.

4470
02:44:48,880 --> 02:44:50,180
Do I get Sparrow?

4471
02:44:50,340 --> 02:44:50,960
Oh my god!

4472
02:44:51,200 --> 02:44:51,760
I don't even...

4473
02:44:51,760 --> 02:44:53,420
I forgot to select Sparrow!

4474
02:44:55,360 --> 02:44:56,360
That's fine.

4475
02:44:56,560 --> 02:44:57,080
Cold snaps.

4476
02:44:58,480 --> 02:44:59,200
Wait.

4477
02:44:59,340 --> 02:45:00,040
I can do this.

4478
02:45:01,120 --> 02:45:01,660
Alright.

4479
02:45:01,880 --> 02:45:02,240
Nice.

4480
02:45:02,720 --> 02:45:03,260
Guys.

4481
02:45:03,400 --> 02:45:04,200
I might lose this.

4482
02:45:04,440 --> 02:45:05,460
Because I went with...

4483
02:45:05,460 --> 02:45:07,000
I might have fucked up.

4484
02:45:08,080 --> 02:45:09,760
I might have fucked up.

4485
02:45:14,330 --> 02:45:14,870
Guys.

4486
02:45:15,470 --> 02:45:16,950
Ice Monkey's Trout was not it.

4487
02:45:21,230 --> 02:45:23,830
Ice Monkey's Trout was not...

4488
02:45:23,830 --> 02:45:24,150
Oh wait.

4489
02:45:24,190 --> 02:45:25,630
You guys can't see the bloons.

4490
02:45:25,930 --> 02:45:26,170
No.

4491
02:45:26,290 --> 02:45:26,610
You didn't.

4492
02:45:26,710 --> 02:45:26,870
No.

4493
02:45:27,050 --> 02:45:27,570
I won.

4494
02:45:27,770 --> 02:45:28,190
Guys.

4495
02:45:28,850 --> 02:45:29,390
Guys.

4496
02:45:29,390 --> 02:45:29,910
I won.

4497
02:45:29,910 --> 02:45:31,090
I won the game.

4498
02:45:31,350 --> 02:45:32,770
I won my bloons games.

4499
02:45:32,810 --> 02:45:33,610
I fucked up.

4500
02:45:33,630 --> 02:45:35,250
Because I did too well.

4501
02:45:35,790 --> 02:45:37,010
It's actually crazy.

4502
02:45:37,130 --> 02:45:38,010
I wish you were there.

4503
02:45:38,230 --> 02:45:38,410
Guys.

4504
02:45:38,570 --> 02:45:39,250
I just did.

4505
02:45:39,530 --> 02:45:41,270
Oh my god.

4506
02:45:43,310 --> 02:45:45,490
Oh my god.

4507
02:45:45,810 --> 02:45:48,170
Oh my god.

4508
02:45:51,530 --> 02:45:54,470
Oh my god.

4509
02:45:56,320 --> 02:45:57,240
Okay.

4510
02:45:59,360 --> 02:46:00,080
Okay.

4511
02:46:01,120 --> 02:46:03,380
Let me shield self first.

4512
02:46:03,920 --> 02:46:04,460
Let me...

4513
02:46:06,120 --> 02:46:06,840
Okay.

4514
02:46:11,980 --> 02:46:12,700
Okay.

4515
02:46:17,870 --> 02:46:18,230
Alright.

4516
02:46:18,970 --> 02:46:20,510
Shot him in the back.

4517
02:46:20,730 --> 02:46:21,730
As he deserved.

4518
02:46:23,890 --> 02:46:25,310
Bro, this guy's an R9.

4519
02:46:25,430 --> 02:46:26,030
That's not fair.

4520
02:46:27,750 --> 02:46:29,630
I'm not fucking pushing this.

4521
02:46:29,770 --> 02:46:30,550
I'm fucking...

4522
02:46:30,550 --> 02:46:31,750
Taking my time.

4523
02:46:36,390 --> 02:46:37,510
Third party?

4524
02:46:37,790 --> 02:46:38,050
Huh?

4525
02:46:41,490 --> 02:46:42,910
Oh man.

4526
02:46:44,610 --> 02:46:45,330
Oh.

4527
02:46:45,590 --> 02:46:46,230
That's unlucky.

4528
02:46:49,430 --> 02:46:50,150
Nice.

4529
02:46:52,950 --> 02:46:54,390
Oh my god.

4530
02:46:55,530 --> 02:46:56,250
Third party.

4531
02:46:56,390 --> 02:46:56,750
Let's go.

4532
02:47:02,170 --> 02:47:02,730
Okay.

4533
02:47:03,450 --> 02:47:05,330
That was my one bullet, by the way.

4534
02:47:06,830 --> 02:47:08,010
That was my...

4535
02:47:11,370 --> 02:47:12,950
That was my one bullet.

4536
02:47:13,310 --> 02:47:13,830
Let's go.

4537
02:47:14,830 --> 02:47:16,730
My one bullet and drink.

4538
02:47:28,500 --> 02:47:29,200
I know.

4539
02:47:29,440 --> 02:47:30,160
I know.

4540
02:47:35,660 --> 02:47:36,960
Don't worry about Ring Fry.

4541
02:47:37,280 --> 02:47:37,940
We're in the next ring.

4542
02:47:41,900 --> 02:47:42,340
Wait.

4543
02:47:44,460 --> 02:47:44,900
Hello.

4544
02:47:47,380 --> 02:47:48,740
My one bullet.

4545
02:47:49,360 --> 02:47:50,660
I missed.

4546
02:47:54,020 --> 02:47:55,840
Oh my god.

4547
02:47:56,940 --> 02:47:57,100
What?

4548
02:47:57,400 --> 02:47:57,740
Okay.

4549
02:48:00,400 --> 02:48:01,980
I can't.

4550
02:48:04,340 --> 02:48:07,200
Get me out of the bell curve.

4551
02:48:08,020 --> 02:48:11,700
Get me out of the bell curve.

4552
02:48:15,620 --> 02:48:17,040
I didn't use my shield.

4553
02:48:17,200 --> 02:48:17,940
I didn't press Q.

4554
02:48:19,380 --> 02:48:20,900
Get me out.

4555
02:48:22,380 --> 02:48:25,420
I feel like I did so much, too.

4556
02:48:25,940 --> 02:48:27,300
That was the worst part.

4557
02:48:29,580 --> 02:48:33,100
I'm going through the five stages of Apex grief right now.

4558
02:48:34,480 --> 02:48:35,140
Oh my god.

4559
02:48:35,240 --> 02:48:35,540
Thank god.

4560
02:48:35,700 --> 02:48:36,140
He died.

4561
02:48:36,620 --> 02:48:39,320
They took me to, like, all I'm saying.

4562
02:48:39,680 --> 02:48:39,840
Okay.

4563
02:48:40,160 --> 02:48:42,540
So this might... This is not a hot take.

4564
02:48:42,920 --> 02:48:44,880
But, like, if you're...

4565
02:48:44,880 --> 02:48:51,040
If you're gonna take me to hell, you have to play like you can survive hell.

4566
02:48:51,480 --> 02:48:58,960
And all I'm saying were these two players did not play like they could survive hell.

4567
02:49:04,940 --> 02:49:12,180
If you're gonna take me to six teams... You better play like you can take on six teams.

4568
02:49:12,680 --> 02:49:16,580
I... You have... It's not a hot take.

4569
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:21,280
That's all I'm... Don't put me in fucking hell if you can't survive it.

4570
02:49:21,280 --> 02:49:25,660
If I had to fucking do four knocks.

4571
02:49:26,220 --> 02:49:32,680
If I had to do that much damage within two minutes, by the way.

4572
02:49:33,080 --> 02:49:34,560
In two minutes.

4573
02:49:34,820 --> 02:49:38,160
And I did three knocks and a kill.

4574
02:49:38,860 --> 02:49:41,640
I... You gotta be able to survive this area.

4575
02:49:41,640 --> 02:49:42,760
If I had to leave.

4576
02:49:42,760 --> 02:49:42,760
You just...

4577
02:49:45,760 --> 02:49:47,740
Couldn't handle the heat.

4578
02:49:48,480 --> 02:49:48,640
Right.

4579
02:49:49,360 --> 02:49:51,120
It's a perfect all constant.

4580
02:49:52,800 --> 02:49:56,160
Both three... Damage combined times seven.

4581
02:49:56,700 --> 02:49:57,500
That's just...

4582
02:49:57,500 --> 02:49:59,020
Am I asking too much?

4583
02:49:59,240 --> 02:49:59,920
No, right.

4584
02:50:00,320 --> 02:50:02,820
Surely I'm not asking too much, right guys?

4585
02:50:03,080 --> 02:50:04,720
Surely that's not it.

4586
02:50:06,160 --> 02:50:09,440
She is cracked, but she is only one little bird.

4587
02:50:11,660 --> 02:50:15,340
Bro's could not survive the salty split, dude.

4588
02:50:17,220 --> 02:50:18,140
No, right?

4589
02:50:18,300 --> 02:50:19,380
No, there's no way.

4590
02:50:19,560 --> 02:50:21,140
It's not asking too much.

4591
02:50:21,260 --> 02:50:23,820
That's like asking the bare minimum.

4592
02:50:26,320 --> 02:50:32,260
I'm just... and I think I had the worst position out of every... on my entire team.

4593
02:50:32,260 --> 02:50:35,200
I literally landed into a full team.

4594
02:50:35,380 --> 02:50:37,700
And I somehow lived longer.

4595
02:50:40,580 --> 02:50:44,000
I somehow lived longer than my team.

4596
02:50:44,240 --> 02:50:46,560
And I landed in front of someone.

4597
02:50:48,060 --> 02:50:51,200
Common and matchmaking in my battle royale.

4598
02:50:51,560 --> 02:50:55,060
You're asking too much for a bottom of the curve, teammates.

4599
02:50:55,760 --> 02:51:00,180
Surely I'll... oh, I'm slowly... guys, I'm slowly moving up the bell curve.

4600
02:51:00,180 --> 02:51:02,180
It's like I'm syphilis... what was his name?

4601
02:51:02,720 --> 02:51:04,940
I almost said syphilis.

4602
02:51:05,840 --> 02:51:09,140
Oh my god, I'm slowly moving up, guys.

4603
02:51:09,360 --> 02:51:11,720
I'm pushing the rock up, guys.

4604
02:51:12,040 --> 02:51:13,640
I'm... I'm pushing...

4605
02:51:14,010 --> 02:51:16,920
I'm pushing the rock up the fucking mountain.

4606
02:51:17,600 --> 02:51:18,180
What's this?

4607
02:51:19,820 --> 02:51:20,480
Syphilis?

4608
02:51:20,620 --> 02:51:22,020
I don't fucking know how to pronounce his name.

4609
02:51:23,040 --> 02:51:23,680
Syphilis.

4610
02:51:23,680 --> 02:51:24,500
I'm going up.

4611
02:51:24,700 --> 02:51:25,400
Look at that!

4612
02:51:25,500 --> 02:51:27,280
The rock is pushing it up!

4613
02:51:27,700 --> 02:51:28,120
I am...

4614
02:51:32,060 --> 02:51:33,740
How do you pronounce that?

4615
02:51:34,780 --> 02:51:35,420
Syphilis.

4616
02:51:35,420 --> 02:51:35,820
Keep pushing.

4617
02:51:36,820 --> 02:51:37,460
Syphilis.

4618
02:51:38,600 --> 02:51:39,240
Syphilis.

4619
02:51:39,600 --> 02:51:39,780
Okay.

4620
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:40,620
Syphilis.

4621
02:51:41,720 --> 02:51:46,000
By 30 games, surely I'll be at the middle of this bell curve.

4622
02:51:48,560 --> 02:51:49,600
Um...

4623
02:51:49,600 --> 02:51:51,200
I believe...

4624
02:51:52,600 --> 02:51:56,940
I'm slowly pushing that rock up the curve.

4625
02:51:59,980 --> 02:52:03,500
Ah yes, my favorite Greek tragedy is syphilis.

4626
02:52:03,500 --> 02:52:04,320
Hahaha.

4627
02:52:08,360 --> 02:52:09,660
No, I do need sleep.

4628
02:52:09,740 --> 02:52:11,200
I'm like, delirious right now.

4629
02:52:11,620 --> 02:52:12,020
I'm...

4630
02:52:13,940 --> 02:52:16,080
But at least you guys are enjoying your time.

4631
02:52:32,390 --> 02:52:32,830
Alright.

4632
02:52:35,590 --> 02:52:36,610
How much did I sleep?

4633
02:52:36,790 --> 02:52:37,350
Three hours.

4634
02:52:38,170 --> 02:52:38,610
Hahaha.

4635
02:52:41,370 --> 02:52:41,750
Alright.

4636
02:52:42,330 --> 02:52:42,970
It's okay.

4637
02:52:42,970 --> 02:52:43,910
We're sort of...

4638
02:52:43,910 --> 02:52:44,430
We're up...

4639
02:52:44,430 --> 02:52:45,890
We're up the bell curve a little.

4640
02:52:46,130 --> 02:52:46,890
I swear to god.

4641
02:52:47,170 --> 02:52:47,910
Please survive.

4642
02:52:48,870 --> 02:52:49,030
Hahaha.

4643
02:52:50,050 --> 02:52:50,910
I don't...

4644
02:52:50,910 --> 02:52:52,950
Ask for a lot of things.

4645
02:52:53,910 --> 02:52:56,370
I just want my team to be alive.

4646
02:53:04,710 --> 02:53:05,530
Oh my god.

4647
02:53:05,670 --> 02:53:06,210
I need to...

4648
02:53:06,210 --> 02:53:07,450
I need to get used to that.

4649
02:53:07,650 --> 02:53:08,850
It just always fucks me up.

4650
02:53:09,150 --> 02:53:10,270
Which is not good.

4651
02:53:10,730 --> 02:53:11,810
I hit my forehead.

4652
02:53:14,310 --> 02:53:14,790
Okay.

4653
02:53:16,090 --> 02:53:17,130
Get a 2x.

4654
02:53:17,130 --> 02:53:18,130
Oh my god.

4655
02:53:18,310 --> 02:53:18,470
Please.

4656
02:53:18,650 --> 02:53:19,690
I need another gun.

4657
02:53:20,350 --> 02:53:21,230
Oh, there you go.

4658
02:53:21,390 --> 02:53:22,490
I ask and I got it.

4659
02:53:29,630 --> 02:53:30,030
Okay.

4660
02:53:30,110 --> 02:53:31,170
I didn't mean to do that.

4661
02:53:31,630 --> 02:53:32,030
Hahaha.

4662
02:53:32,690 --> 02:53:34,190
Hey, you know like that entire...

4663
02:53:34,190 --> 02:53:35,230
That was an accident.

4664
02:53:35,510 --> 02:53:35,990
I would...

4665
02:53:35,990 --> 02:53:37,690
I didn't even aim for it.

4666
02:53:37,930 --> 02:53:38,330
I...

4667
02:53:38,330 --> 02:53:39,110
I don't know.

4668
02:53:39,270 --> 02:53:40,870
I didn't even aim for it, guys.

4669
02:53:41,410 --> 02:53:41,730
I...

4670
02:53:43,970 --> 02:53:44,670
I legit...

4671
02:53:44,670 --> 02:53:45,590
I didn't even aim for that.

4672
02:53:45,710 --> 02:53:46,750
I don't know how I got...

4673
02:53:49,730 --> 02:53:51,010
I would shoot my gun too.

4674
02:53:54,270 --> 02:53:55,050
Oh my god.

4675
02:53:55,150 --> 02:53:56,090
It's so hard to track this.

4676
02:53:57,390 --> 02:53:58,170
That's bad.

4677
02:54:05,810 --> 02:54:06,350
No!

4678
02:54:06,810 --> 02:54:07,570
What ping wise?

4679
02:54:07,710 --> 02:54:08,790
I should've got that.

4680
02:54:09,470 --> 02:54:11,370
That had a hit register too.

4681
02:54:11,930 --> 02:54:12,750
God dammit.

4682
02:54:12,750 --> 02:54:14,690
You get an R9?!

4683
02:54:14,690 --> 02:54:15,230
Who...

4684
02:54:15,230 --> 02:54:16,750
Who gave you blessing?!

4685
02:54:17,530 --> 02:54:18,590
Aw man.

4686
02:54:18,910 --> 02:54:19,290
Oh wait.

4687
02:54:19,430 --> 02:54:19,830
This team.

4688
02:54:19,950 --> 02:54:20,410
Nevermind.

4689
02:54:20,670 --> 02:54:21,030
No.

4690
02:54:21,810 --> 02:54:22,970
God dammit.

4691
02:54:23,350 --> 02:54:24,990
Aw, he got an R9 too.

4692
02:54:25,330 --> 02:54:25,550
They...

4693
02:54:25,550 --> 02:54:26,410
They blessed him.

4694
02:54:27,690 --> 02:54:29,830
They actually blessed him.

4695
02:54:30,590 --> 02:54:32,590
Wait, Orax became a dev?

4696
02:54:32,890 --> 02:54:33,530
Since when?

4697
02:54:34,030 --> 02:54:35,850
When did Orax became a dev?

4698
02:54:36,090 --> 02:54:36,830
He was a...

4699
02:54:36,830 --> 02:54:37,110
Pro.

4700
02:54:38,250 --> 02:54:39,670
Did they give all pros...

4701
02:54:39,670 --> 02:54:40,730
There's no way.

4702
02:54:41,850 --> 02:54:42,990
Wasn't he a pro player?

4703
02:54:45,410 --> 02:54:45,850
Yeah.

4704
02:54:46,290 --> 02:54:47,550
When did he became a dev?

4705
02:54:50,980 --> 02:54:52,220
Or like a caster?

4706
02:54:52,620 --> 02:54:53,160
Or was he a ca...

4707
02:54:53,160 --> 02:54:54,060
No, he was a pro.

4708
02:54:54,700 --> 02:54:56,280
I don't fucking remember he was.

4709
02:54:57,640 --> 02:54:58,880
I remember he played.

4710
02:54:59,280 --> 02:54:59,620
Yeah.

4711
02:55:00,400 --> 02:55:02,100
The fuck he became a...

4712
02:55:03,540 --> 02:55:03,980
Evok.

4713
02:55:05,100 --> 02:55:06,780
I was like, how did he get a...

4714
02:55:06,780 --> 02:55:08,460
I know he was a pro player.

4715
02:55:08,620 --> 02:55:09,640
I recognize his name.

4716
02:55:11,640 --> 02:55:12,960
No, uh...

4717
02:55:13,400 --> 02:55:13,840
Um...

4718
02:55:13,840 --> 02:55:15,340
A dev badge is...

4719
02:55:15,340 --> 02:55:15,540
Oh!

4720
02:55:15,820 --> 02:55:16,780
All badges are...

4721
02:55:16,780 --> 02:55:19,840
That's so cheesy!

4722
02:55:20,440 --> 02:55:24,360
I forgot!

4723
02:55:25,040 --> 02:55:27,440
All badges are available.

4724
02:55:27,440 --> 02:55:30,820
So everybody's putting on the dev badge.

4725
02:55:30,820 --> 02:55:32,280
I'm so dumb.

4726
02:55:32,840 --> 02:55:33,440
I'm...

4727
02:55:34,660 --> 02:55:35,260
I'm...

4728
02:55:35,260 --> 02:55:37,800
That actually makes a lot of sense.

4729
02:55:38,520 --> 02:55:39,120
Time...

4730
02:55:39,120 --> 02:55:41,060
Time to be a dev, guys!

4731
02:55:41,580 --> 02:55:42,900
I'm gonna be a dev now.

4732
02:55:45,260 --> 02:55:45,860
I'm...

4733
02:55:45,860 --> 02:55:47,280
That joke you put on.

4734
02:55:47,500 --> 02:55:47,740
Even...

4735
02:55:47,740 --> 02:55:49,560
Even I can be a dev, guys.

4736
02:55:50,180 --> 02:55:51,320
Oh my god.

4737
02:55:53,060 --> 02:55:54,260
Which is nice straight down.

4738
02:55:54,260 --> 02:55:55,160
I'm gonna end it.

4739
02:55:57,200 --> 02:55:58,620
Just end it.

4740
02:56:01,780 --> 02:56:02,540
Alright.

4741
02:56:03,980 --> 02:56:06,700
Don't let the intrusion thoughts win, Doki!

4742
02:56:07,160 --> 02:56:09,160
Don't let them catch you!

4743
02:56:12,340 --> 02:56:13,340
Wait, what?

4744
02:56:15,080 --> 02:56:15,460
Oh.

4745
02:56:18,740 --> 02:56:19,500
Really?

4746
02:56:21,520 --> 02:56:22,820
Is he fucking with me?

4747
02:56:22,820 --> 02:56:23,440
He's...

4748
02:56:23,440 --> 02:56:24,160
There's no way.

4749
02:56:24,520 --> 02:56:25,500
Oh, there is.

4750
02:56:28,140 --> 02:56:29,100
Oh my god.

4751
02:56:40,200 --> 02:56:40,640
Please!

4752
02:56:40,760 --> 02:56:41,280
Where's my team?

4753
02:56:41,400 --> 02:56:42,020
Oh my god.

4754
02:56:42,080 --> 02:56:43,300
I thought he was with me.

4755
02:56:43,700 --> 02:56:44,140
I...

4756
02:56:44,140 --> 02:56:44,860
Oh my god.

4757
02:56:45,220 --> 02:56:46,320
Oh, he's...

4758
02:56:46,320 --> 02:56:46,660
Wait.

4759
02:56:46,820 --> 02:56:47,500
That's a new team.

4760
02:56:47,660 --> 02:56:48,320
Oh my god.

4761
02:56:48,320 --> 02:56:49,180
That's a new team.

4762
02:56:49,400 --> 02:56:49,800
Goodbye.

4763
02:56:49,800 --> 02:56:50,440
I'm sorry.

4764
02:56:50,620 --> 02:56:52,200
You're gonna have to go through hell.

4765
02:56:52,500 --> 02:56:53,220
It's okay.

4766
02:56:53,700 --> 02:56:54,940
I've wanted to...

4767
02:56:55,520 --> 02:56:56,620
It's okay, guys.

4768
02:56:57,740 --> 02:56:58,620
I wanted...

4769
02:56:58,620 --> 02:57:00,720
I didn't realize two people were gonna be like...

4770
02:57:00,720 --> 02:57:01,140
He could...

4771
02:57:01,140 --> 02:57:02,120
I thought it was one guy.

4772
02:57:02,660 --> 02:57:02,940
Alright.

4773
02:57:03,060 --> 02:57:03,180
No.

4774
02:57:03,260 --> 02:57:03,600
It's okay.

4775
02:57:03,700 --> 02:57:04,500
I wanted to die.

4776
02:57:04,500 --> 02:57:05,620
So I could do this.

4777
02:57:07,720 --> 02:57:08,660
Where's my badge?

4778
02:57:09,040 --> 02:57:09,580
Oh my god.

4779
02:57:09,700 --> 02:57:09,960
I'm...

4780
02:57:09,960 --> 02:57:11,580
My eyes are blurring right now.

4781
02:57:11,980 --> 02:57:13,040
Oh my god.

4782
02:57:13,240 --> 02:57:13,400
Wait.

4783
02:57:13,580 --> 02:57:14,200
It's all bronze.

4784
02:57:14,920 --> 02:57:15,400
Wait.

4785
02:57:15,940 --> 02:57:16,400
Thank you.

4786
02:57:16,660 --> 02:57:16,980
Hahaha.

4787
02:57:20,220 --> 02:57:20,500
Okay.

4788
02:57:20,620 --> 02:57:20,760
Wait.

4789
02:57:21,600 --> 02:57:22,080
Here.

4790
02:57:22,380 --> 02:57:23,860
And then...

4791
02:57:24,700 --> 02:57:25,520
And then...

4792
02:57:25,520 --> 02:57:25,620
Wait.

4793
02:57:25,680 --> 02:57:26,480
Where's my...

4794
02:57:27,240 --> 02:57:28,300
I'm so tired.

4795
02:57:28,760 --> 02:57:28,940
Wait.

4796
02:57:28,940 --> 02:57:30,020
Don't miss me.

4797
02:57:30,560 --> 02:57:30,980
And then...

4798
02:57:32,300 --> 02:57:33,820
Where's the dev badge?

4799
02:57:37,470 --> 02:57:38,270
Where is it?

4800
02:57:39,010 --> 02:57:39,630
It's...

4801
02:57:39,630 --> 02:57:40,110
There you go.

4802
02:57:40,530 --> 02:57:41,130
There you go.

4803
02:57:41,270 --> 02:57:42,170
Now I'm a real dev.

4804
02:57:43,070 --> 02:57:43,690
I'm...

4805
02:57:43,690 --> 02:57:43,990
Hahaha.

4806
02:57:45,330 --> 02:57:45,710
Okay.

4807
02:57:46,670 --> 02:57:47,310
Uh...

4808
02:57:47,310 --> 02:57:47,930
Banners.

4809
02:57:48,310 --> 02:57:48,930
Badges.

4810
02:57:51,370 --> 02:57:52,010
Finally.

4811
02:57:52,010 --> 02:57:52,990
A badge for me.

4812
02:57:53,350 --> 02:57:55,170
I've always wanted a rookie badge.

4813
02:57:56,010 --> 02:57:57,670
I feel like that's more special.

4814
02:58:00,490 --> 02:58:01,070
I feel like that's more special.

4815
02:58:01,450 --> 02:58:05,070
I think the rookie badge is more special than any other badge out there.

4816
02:58:05,250 --> 02:58:07,390
Because it's so hard to be a rookie.

4817
02:58:08,130 --> 02:58:10,610
You have to have the time commitment to be a rookie.

4818
02:58:16,450 --> 02:58:17,630
Actually not time commitment.

4819
02:58:17,750 --> 02:58:20,070
You have to like play one game and then like...

4820
02:58:20,070 --> 02:58:22,090
Come back to Apex.

4821
02:58:22,350 --> 02:58:23,870
And then play another game.

4822
02:58:24,390 --> 02:58:25,070
Hahaha.

4823
02:58:27,970 --> 02:58:28,330
Guys.

4824
02:58:28,630 --> 02:58:29,250
Oh my god.

4825
02:58:29,490 --> 02:58:29,710
Guys.

4826
02:58:30,090 --> 02:58:32,570
I'm part of the respawn team now.

4827
02:58:32,570 --> 02:58:33,410
Look at that.

4828
02:58:34,170 --> 02:58:34,610
There's my...

4829
02:58:34,610 --> 02:58:35,190
Look at that.

4830
02:58:35,190 --> 02:58:36,870
I got the dev badge.

4831
02:58:37,250 --> 02:58:38,230
Oh my god.

4832
02:58:38,610 --> 02:58:39,590
Look at that.

4833
02:58:40,370 --> 02:58:41,830
I'm so good.

4834
02:58:42,670 --> 02:58:43,290
Uh...

4835
02:58:43,630 --> 02:58:43,930
Oh wait.

4836
02:58:43,990 --> 02:58:45,610
Does that mean all of this is unlocked too?

4837
02:58:45,790 --> 02:58:46,030
Wait.

4838
02:58:46,110 --> 02:58:47,070
Do I have the ALGS?

4839
02:58:48,370 --> 02:58:49,830
The ALGS banner?

4840
02:58:51,370 --> 02:58:53,210
There's an ALGS frame banner right?

4841
02:58:53,370 --> 02:58:53,890
I don't remember.

4842
02:58:54,030 --> 02:58:55,810
There's like something ALGS related.

4843
02:58:56,210 --> 02:58:57,350
That you can get.

4844
02:58:58,710 --> 02:58:59,330
Master.

4845
02:58:59,850 --> 02:59:01,030
Make your choice.

4846
02:59:01,190 --> 02:59:01,770
P2020.

4847
02:59:02,330 --> 02:59:02,950
Master.

4848
02:59:03,530 --> 02:59:04,150
Prize.

4849
02:59:04,330 --> 02:59:04,930
Possession.

4850
02:59:07,170 --> 02:59:07,790
Uh...

4851
02:59:07,790 --> 02:59:09,950
I don't think she's gonna...

4852
02:59:09,950 --> 02:59:11,790
Don't let them say that.

4853
02:59:13,050 --> 02:59:16,670
Is there like some ALGS related shit you can get?

4854
02:59:18,630 --> 02:59:20,070
To be like, wait is it...

4855
02:59:20,070 --> 02:59:20,950
Oh my...

4856
02:59:23,730 --> 02:59:24,090
Yes.

4857
02:59:30,550 --> 02:59:31,630
That's me!

4858
02:59:32,970 --> 02:59:34,130
That's me.

4859
02:59:34,910 --> 02:59:36,430
I deserve that.

4860
02:59:37,670 --> 02:59:39,530
Oh, you can put like art on this.

4861
02:59:39,530 --> 02:59:39,850
Wait.

4862
02:59:39,910 --> 02:59:41,310
I didn't realize you can do that.

4863
02:59:42,090 --> 02:59:43,890
Oh, this is so new to me.

4864
02:59:44,230 --> 02:59:44,290
Okay.

4865
02:59:44,390 --> 02:59:46,330
This is Aereo Superiority.

4866
02:59:47,730 --> 02:59:48,250
Uh...

4867
02:59:48,250 --> 02:59:52,690
I have all the time in the world to customize my banner.

4868
02:59:53,130 --> 02:59:54,690
Time to make up!

4869
02:59:54,970 --> 02:59:55,450
Guys!

4870
02:59:55,590 --> 02:59:56,030
Wait.

4871
02:59:56,250 --> 02:59:56,490
Wait.

4872
02:59:56,550 --> 02:59:57,270
You're right.

4873
02:59:57,850 --> 02:59:58,070
Wait.

4874
02:59:58,270 --> 02:59:58,510
Guys.

4875
02:59:58,910 --> 02:59:59,430
Wait.

4876
02:59:59,670 --> 03:00:00,530
You're so right.

4877
03:00:01,690 --> 03:00:03,630
Let me take a screenshot.

4878
03:00:14,610 --> 03:00:16,110
You're so right.

4879
03:00:16,790 --> 03:00:17,530
Give me a sec.

4880
03:00:17,870 --> 03:00:18,830
Let me tweet that out.

4881
03:00:34,890 --> 03:00:36,150
You're so red.

4882
03:00:36,470 --> 03:00:37,350
You're so red!

4883
03:00:37,350 --> 03:00:37,770
You're so red!

4884
03:00:39,710 --> 03:00:40,410
That's cool.

4885
03:00:40,590 --> 03:00:42,050
I have to bring like..

4886
03:00:46,230 --> 03:00:47,490
You don't even have to take a screenshot.

4887
03:00:48,170 --> 03:00:48,810
No...

4888
03:00:48,810 --> 03:00:49,190
Let's go.

4889
03:00:49,810 --> 03:00:51,870
Haters will say it's fake.

4890
03:00:51,990 --> 03:00:52,970
They're just jealous.

4891
03:00:54,030 --> 03:00:56,190
They're just jealous, guys.

4892
03:00:56,710 --> 03:01:00,330
Alright, and then... What is this?

4893
03:01:01,450 --> 03:01:02,890
Is this ALGS?

4894
03:01:03,410 --> 03:01:04,810
Do it for the rush?

4895
03:01:05,070 --> 03:01:06,570
I don't even know what this is.

4896
03:01:06,850 --> 03:01:07,310
Good luck.

4897
03:01:07,530 --> 03:01:08,050
Don't that.

4898
03:01:08,590 --> 03:01:09,330
Oh, there's team.

4899
03:01:09,530 --> 03:01:10,470
Oh, this is the ALGS.

4900
03:01:10,550 --> 03:01:12,770
But this is like supporting them and stuff.

4901
03:01:14,270 --> 03:01:16,170
Do you guys think they'll believe me?

4902
03:01:17,250 --> 03:01:18,730
Do you guys...

4903
03:01:20,370 --> 03:01:24,570
Do you think they'll... Do you think people will believe me?

4904
03:01:28,030 --> 03:01:30,990
Add dev or staff in front of your name.

4905
03:01:31,410 --> 03:01:33,010
Guys, where was I on the bell curve?

4906
03:01:33,230 --> 03:01:35,230
Did I drop down or climbed a little bit?

4907
03:01:35,430 --> 03:01:39,190
Oh, I forgot to look at the... the sparrow skin.

4908
03:01:40,850 --> 03:01:42,230
I mean, sure.

4909
03:01:42,570 --> 03:01:44,030
Haters would say it's fake.

4910
03:01:44,310 --> 03:01:44,750
So true.

4911
03:01:46,010 --> 03:01:46,410
So true.

4912
03:01:46,610 --> 03:01:47,710
All they do is hate.

4913
03:01:48,770 --> 03:01:52,350
They didn't... They didn't watch the stream where it's so real.

4914
03:02:02,030 --> 03:02:05,750
I wish I was champion so I could put that out.

4915
03:02:06,990 --> 03:02:09,410
They can only go up, don't keep.

4916
03:02:14,930 --> 03:02:15,190
Alright.

4917
03:02:15,810 --> 03:02:16,190
Nah.

4918
03:02:17,310 --> 03:02:19,910
They're gonna be so scared now.

4919
03:02:24,280 --> 03:02:25,360
Oh, my God.

4920
03:02:25,480 --> 03:02:26,760
I just needed like a decent team.

4921
03:02:27,660 --> 03:02:28,800
And I gotta not throw.

4922
03:02:29,080 --> 03:02:29,900
I gotta not troll.

4923
03:02:30,240 --> 03:02:32,320
I gotta not throw and troll.

4924
03:02:32,560 --> 03:02:33,460
Also, like...

4925
03:02:33,460 --> 03:02:36,300
By the way, have you guys noticed that...

4926
03:02:36,300 --> 03:02:36,840
Are you...

4927
03:02:36,840 --> 03:02:38,120
Okay.

4928
03:02:38,540 --> 03:02:39,100
I...

4929
03:02:39,100 --> 03:02:39,620
What happened?

4930
03:02:39,960 --> 03:02:45,880
But have you guys noticed that I haven't encountered a single R9 for myself to hold?

4931
03:02:46,560 --> 03:02:48,200
I don't think I've...

4932
03:02:48,200 --> 03:02:49,200
During the whole...

4933
03:02:49,200 --> 03:02:53,580
The only time I've actually used R9 was during...

4934
03:02:53,580 --> 03:02:56,800
Was during arenas when I bought the R9.

4935
03:03:00,520 --> 03:03:02,640
I haven't yet to encounter.

4936
03:03:02,980 --> 03:03:03,940
Oh, there it is!

4937
03:03:05,340 --> 03:03:06,340
There it is!

4938
03:03:06,500 --> 03:03:07,320
Alright, there we go.

4939
03:03:07,460 --> 03:03:08,200
I asked...

4940
03:03:08,200 --> 03:03:09,520
I complained and I got it.

4941
03:03:12,680 --> 03:03:13,440
Never mind.

4942
03:03:14,200 --> 03:03:14,620
I'm not...

4943
03:03:14,620 --> 03:03:16,460
I guess I just gotta keep complaining.

4944
03:03:17,440 --> 03:03:18,720
Speak of the devil!

4945
03:03:19,680 --> 03:03:20,800
I'm gonna lose it.

4946
03:03:20,880 --> 03:03:21,660
I can feel it.

4947
03:03:23,780 --> 03:03:24,520
I give...

4948
03:03:24,520 --> 03:03:24,880
Oh, my God.

4949
03:03:24,980 --> 03:03:25,900
It's DJ Sneaky Snake.

4950
03:03:25,900 --> 03:03:27,140
Do you remember him?

4951
03:03:27,500 --> 03:03:28,920
It's DJ Sneaky Snake.

4952
03:03:30,120 --> 03:03:31,320
It's just a pal.

4953
03:03:31,400 --> 03:03:32,160
Guys, look at that.

4954
03:03:32,400 --> 03:03:35,780
I became a dev and now I get every gun I've ever wanted.

4955
03:03:37,540 --> 03:03:40,120
Also, guys, I also noticed...

4956
03:03:41,500 --> 03:03:47,960
Tomorrow, we won't be doing an Apex stream on Twitch because apparently you have to start at 9 a.m.

4957
03:03:48,000 --> 03:03:50,900
Or, like, if you wanna do Battle Royale, it'll be at 11 a.m.

4958
03:03:51,020 --> 03:03:54,500
And, like, I'm not strong enough to do back-to-back morning streams.

4959
03:03:54,500 --> 03:03:54,980
I...

4960
03:03:54,980 --> 03:03:55,700
I can't.

4961
03:03:56,080 --> 03:03:56,720
I'm...

4962
03:03:56,720 --> 03:03:57,220
I...

4963
03:03:57,220 --> 03:04:00,620
To give it to you guys straight, I am not strong enough for that.

4964
03:04:00,760 --> 03:04:01,160
I...

4965
03:04:01,160 --> 03:04:01,560
Because...

4966
03:04:01,560 --> 03:04:04,200
The server closes at 1 p.m.

4967
03:04:04,300 --> 03:04:04,880
And...

4968
03:04:05,520 --> 03:04:07,720
Like, I guess we'll never...

4969
03:04:08,960 --> 03:04:11,320
I'm just a little bit...

4970
03:04:11,320 --> 03:04:13,460
And I cannot be that person.

4971
03:04:13,460 --> 03:04:14,140
I'm sorry.

4972
03:04:16,800 --> 03:04:19,700
I cannot be that person for you guys.

4973
03:04:22,540 --> 03:04:25,000
I mean, there's, like, a full team here.

4974
03:04:25,080 --> 03:04:26,460
And then there's a team right in Terminal.

4975
03:04:27,920 --> 03:04:29,320
Yeah, I can't...

4976
03:04:29,320 --> 03:04:36,440
I understand that this is all the Apex content for the early season preview.

4977
03:04:40,650 --> 03:04:42,670
Just want more ammo real quick.

4978
03:04:44,070 --> 03:04:45,430
Just a little burn.

4979
03:04:45,670 --> 03:04:47,430
I have, like, one stack for each gun.

4980
03:04:47,590 --> 03:04:48,530
This is not the best.

4981
03:04:50,250 --> 03:04:50,830
Alright.

4982
03:04:53,430 --> 03:04:55,210
I mean, I'm having fun.

4983
03:04:55,510 --> 03:04:56,650
I'm having fun.

4984
03:05:01,160 --> 03:05:07,160
I just can't survive back-to-back early streams because I'm not strong enough.

4985
03:05:07,740 --> 03:05:10,400
I simply am just one person.

4986
03:05:10,400 --> 03:05:10,740
Oh.

4987
03:05:11,080 --> 03:05:12,100
They're rezzing.

4988
03:05:15,000 --> 03:05:16,300
I know I should press...

4989
03:05:16,300 --> 03:05:18,540
I should do the easier way of this, but...

4990
03:05:18,540 --> 03:05:19,920
bad habits.

4991
03:05:20,780 --> 03:05:23,180
Bad habits and I'll never learn.

4992
03:05:23,680 --> 03:05:25,260
I will, maybe, eventually.

4993
03:05:28,880 --> 03:05:30,380
Where did it go?

4994
03:05:32,260 --> 03:05:35,120
I don't want to waste my jammers because I feel like...

4995
03:05:38,600 --> 03:05:40,660
I guess I waste my jammers.

4996
03:05:43,100 --> 03:05:45,220
I didn't want to, but...

4997
03:05:48,100 --> 03:05:48,960
Where are they?

4998
03:05:49,900 --> 03:05:51,060
Did you track them?

4999
03:05:54,100 --> 03:05:54,660
Where...

5000
03:05:54,660 --> 03:05:55,940
Where are they?

5001
03:05:56,740 --> 03:05:57,980
If I die, I die.

5002
03:06:04,240 --> 03:06:05,820
Okay, other squad is here.

5003
03:06:10,110 --> 03:06:11,350
Shoot the tracker!

5004
03:06:11,610 --> 03:06:13,550
It's not like you can't shoot it!

5005
03:06:14,530 --> 03:06:15,530
Jesus Christ.

5006
03:06:22,710 --> 03:06:24,390
Oh my god.

5007
03:06:25,990 --> 03:06:26,530
Okay.

5008
03:06:29,350 --> 03:06:30,950
Thank god, okay.

5009
03:06:36,500 --> 03:06:38,180
This is bad for us.

5010
03:06:38,800 --> 03:06:40,820
We don't have LOS of it, so we're fine.

5011
03:06:47,080 --> 03:06:52,720
I'm like, trying to fight this, but like, we're getting shot from everywhere, which is really difficult.

5012
03:06:53,880 --> 03:06:55,340
I think that's the worst part.

5013
03:06:55,480 --> 03:06:56,800
There's like, several teams here.

5014
03:07:00,880 --> 03:07:01,460
Oh!

5015
03:07:04,800 --> 03:07:05,380
Okay.

5016
03:07:05,940 --> 03:07:08,200
I have a respawn beacon.

5017
03:07:08,640 --> 03:07:09,680
No, it's fine.

5018
03:07:09,680 --> 03:07:10,720
I'll res him here.

5019
03:07:10,720 --> 03:07:11,820
I think we should go here.

5020
03:07:12,640 --> 03:07:14,020
I'm sending him back.

5021
03:07:16,080 --> 03:07:17,940
I'm sending you back to hell.

5022
03:07:21,960 --> 03:07:22,940
There we go.

5023
03:07:23,920 --> 03:07:24,780
Good luck.

5024
03:07:25,860 --> 03:07:28,360
Here's your energy ammo that I stole.

5025
03:07:28,720 --> 03:07:32,100
I'm not going into this fight by myself, by the way.

5026
03:07:32,440 --> 03:07:32,900
I...

5027
03:07:32,900 --> 03:07:35,000
Alright, JK, fuck it.

5028
03:07:38,820 --> 03:07:41,460
Oh my god, there's another team?

5029
03:07:42,040 --> 03:07:42,780
Bro!

5030
03:07:45,800 --> 03:07:46,840
Help me!

5031
03:07:47,040 --> 03:07:47,200
Oh

5032
03:07:52,310 --> 03:07:52,810
my god.

5033
03:07:53,190 --> 03:07:55,230
I want to leave this hill.

5034
03:07:55,950 --> 03:07:58,190
At least let me fight this hill.

5035
03:07:58,510 --> 03:08:00,690
The fun never ends.

5036
03:08:03,610 --> 03:08:05,750
Can I leave the hill?

5037
03:08:08,970 --> 03:08:10,390
Sucks to be you.

5038
03:08:10,570 --> 03:08:11,390
I don't fucking know.

5039
03:08:11,390 --> 03:08:12,330
I have one stack.

5040
03:08:13,990 --> 03:08:14,510
Bro!

5041
03:08:14,830 --> 03:08:17,610
What the fuck?

5042
03:08:18,650 --> 03:08:19,690
I see...

5043
03:08:22,250 --> 03:08:22,770
Okay.

5044
03:08:24,410 --> 03:08:25,830
Oh my god.

5045
03:08:26,270 --> 03:08:27,390
Oh my god.

5046
03:08:27,730 --> 03:08:28,390
I'm gonna...

5047
03:08:30,990 --> 03:08:32,410
I don't know where I got shot at.

5048
03:08:32,550 --> 03:08:33,270
I really don't know.

5049
03:08:34,270 --> 03:08:39,810
I'm getting shot by like 20 different directions and I'm trying to figure out where I can actually position.

5050
03:08:39,990 --> 03:08:41,850
I feel like I can't position anywhere.

5051
03:08:42,090 --> 03:08:42,710
You know?

5052
03:08:43,390 --> 03:08:45,230
That's how I fucked up I feel right now.

5053
03:08:49,390 --> 03:08:50,550
At least I killed him.

5054
03:08:51,530 --> 03:08:51,870
Jesus.

5055
03:08:59,210 --> 03:09:02,010
Thank god I could use my fucking brain.

5056
03:09:16,990 --> 03:09:18,970
Okay, that shit has a lot of HP.

5057
03:09:20,510 --> 03:09:21,170
That...

5058
03:09:21,170 --> 03:09:22,190
Oh my...

5059
03:09:22,190 --> 03:09:22,870
I'm getting ammo.

5060
03:09:23,050 --> 03:09:24,570
That actually had so much...

5061
03:09:24,570 --> 03:09:28,150
I was not expecting how much HP that was.

5062
03:09:28,550 --> 03:09:29,590
Jesus Christ.

5063
03:09:34,300 --> 03:09:35,560
Oh my god.

5064
03:09:38,300 --> 03:09:39,660
I'm going this way.

5065
03:09:47,480 --> 03:09:48,600
Okay guys.

5066
03:09:48,640 --> 03:09:48,900
Okay guys.

5067
03:09:48,900 --> 03:09:50,120
Let's just die again.

5068
03:09:55,500 --> 03:09:58,600
I don't understand my team.

5069
03:09:59,500 --> 03:10:00,200
I...

5070
03:10:02,980 --> 03:10:03,900
I...

5071
03:10:03,900 --> 03:10:07,060
I don't understand my team.

5072
03:10:07,060 --> 03:10:13,600
I don't know what my team...

5073
03:10:13,600 --> 03:10:14,520
I don't know what my team wants.

5074
03:10:15,100 --> 03:10:15,740
I...

5075
03:10:15,740 --> 03:10:16,880
No, you die.

5076
03:10:17,860 --> 03:10:19,800
You'll never understand.

5077
03:10:20,400 --> 03:10:21,760
I'll never...

5078
03:10:22,120 --> 03:10:25,240
I'll never understand my...

5079
03:10:25,240 --> 03:10:27,280
my team's brain.

5080
03:10:27,940 --> 03:10:28,560
I...

5081
03:10:31,450 --> 03:10:32,850
That was...

5082
03:10:32,850 --> 03:10:33,530
That was...

5083
03:10:33,530 --> 03:10:33,630
Wild.

5084
03:10:34,250 --> 03:10:34,610
Your...

5085
03:10:34,610 --> 03:10:36,030
My team was...

5086
03:10:36,990 --> 03:10:37,690
My...

5087
03:10:37,690 --> 03:10:40,970
Surely I'll get a good RNG.

5088
03:10:41,270 --> 03:10:41,610
I'll...

5089
03:10:41,610 --> 03:10:42,390
Just next time.

5090
03:10:42,610 --> 03:10:43,150
Next game.

5091
03:10:43,330 --> 03:10:44,670
My RNG will improve.

5092
03:10:49,990 --> 03:10:50,690
Surely.

5093
03:10:51,410 --> 03:10:52,330
Oh my god.

5094
03:10:52,530 --> 03:10:53,870
It's DJ Sneaky Snake.

5095
03:10:55,910 --> 03:10:57,510
I don't know anymore.

5096
03:10:58,310 --> 03:10:58,870
Guys.

5097
03:10:58,870 --> 03:10:59,630
It's him.

5098
03:10:59,930 --> 03:11:01,750
It's DJ Sneaky Snake.

5099
03:11:02,110 --> 03:11:02,250
Guys.

5100
03:11:03,030 --> 03:11:04,170
Oh my god.

5101
03:11:08,470 --> 03:11:09,810
I should have...

5102
03:11:09,810 --> 03:11:12,130
I just don't understand.

5103
03:11:12,670 --> 03:11:14,070
I just...

5104
03:11:14,070 --> 03:11:15,650
I just don't understand.

5105
03:11:18,230 --> 03:11:19,030
That...

5106
03:11:19,030 --> 03:11:19,590
Like...

5107
03:11:19,590 --> 03:11:21,830
They were so aggressive for no reason.

5108
03:11:25,430 --> 03:11:26,230
Like...

5109
03:11:26,230 --> 03:11:29,350
There were like 20 different teams around us.

5110
03:11:29,970 --> 03:11:31,710
How is this guy still level 1?

5111
03:11:31,970 --> 03:11:34,050
I saw DJ Sneaky Snake.

5112
03:11:34,050 --> 03:11:34,290
Like...

5113
03:11:34,290 --> 03:11:35,370
And he won?

5114
03:11:38,790 --> 03:11:39,410
Hey look.

5115
03:11:39,410 --> 03:11:39,850
It's me.

5116
03:11:40,070 --> 03:11:41,590
I got to be on the champion.

5117
03:11:41,950 --> 03:11:43,110
With my brain back.

5118
03:11:48,090 --> 03:11:49,290
Oh fuck.

5119
03:11:49,670 --> 03:11:49,750
Okay.

5120
03:11:49,930 --> 03:11:50,690
I don't...

5121
03:11:50,690 --> 03:11:51,330
Do I want to...

5122
03:11:51,330 --> 03:11:52,090
Just die?

5123
03:11:52,410 --> 03:11:53,430
You could just die.

5124
03:11:53,890 --> 03:11:54,370
Yeah.

5125
03:11:54,550 --> 03:11:54,910
Fuck it.

5126
03:11:55,350 --> 03:11:56,650
I believe in this.

5127
03:11:56,810 --> 03:11:59,110
I want my guy to lose his championship.

5128
03:12:00,470 --> 03:12:01,670
Let's just...

5129
03:12:01,670 --> 03:12:01,750
Die.

5130
03:12:02,230 --> 03:12:02,550
Guys.

5131
03:12:05,810 --> 03:12:07,990
He's rank 1 like you are a dev.

5132
03:12:25,020 --> 03:12:25,380
Okay.

5133
03:12:28,160 --> 03:12:29,460
I need that armor slop.

5134
03:12:29,700 --> 03:12:30,220
Really bad.

5135
03:12:30,640 --> 03:12:31,680
You had two guns?

5136
03:12:31,680 --> 03:12:31,920
What is...

5137
03:12:31,920 --> 03:12:33,180
Why did...

5138
03:12:34,700 --> 03:12:35,220
I

5139
03:12:38,310 --> 03:12:39,550
had to fight you too!

5140
03:12:42,190 --> 03:12:43,170
Oh my god.

5141
03:12:43,410 --> 03:12:45,030
Bro what was this guy doing?

5142
03:12:45,250 --> 03:12:45,490
Yeah.

5143
03:12:45,810 --> 03:12:46,910
That was my bad.

5144
03:12:47,350 --> 03:12:49,090
I let DJ Sneaky Snake...

5145
03:12:49,090 --> 03:12:49,450
I let...

5146
03:12:49,450 --> 03:12:51,190
I put DJ Sneaky Snake into hell.

5147
03:12:51,190 --> 03:12:51,890
I...

5148
03:12:55,290 --> 03:12:55,970
Look.

5149
03:12:56,490 --> 03:12:57,690
That was my bad.

5150
03:12:58,070 --> 03:12:59,430
I put him in hell.

5151
03:12:59,610 --> 03:12:59,890
I...

5152
03:12:59,890 --> 03:13:00,910
We saw champion.

5153
03:13:00,910 --> 03:13:02,230
And I was like...

5154
03:13:02,230 --> 03:13:03,610
You are gonna lose...

5155
03:13:03,610 --> 03:13:05,330
I'm gonna let you lose champion.

5156
03:13:07,730 --> 03:13:09,650
I would admit...

5157
03:13:09,650 --> 03:13:11,150
That was on me.

5158
03:13:11,750 --> 03:13:14,110
I took him to hell.

5159
03:13:14,590 --> 03:13:14,950
I...

5160
03:13:16,410 --> 03:13:17,090
But...

5161
03:13:17,090 --> 03:13:18,150
I did.

5162
03:13:18,630 --> 03:13:19,470
I did.

5163
03:13:19,690 --> 03:13:20,770
This guy did nothing.

5164
03:13:20,770 --> 03:13:21,710
I did do...

5165
03:13:21,710 --> 03:13:23,110
I did pull my weight though.

5166
03:13:23,730 --> 03:13:24,130
I...

5167
03:13:24,130 --> 03:13:25,030
I...

5168
03:13:25,030 --> 03:13:27,570
I pulled my weight in hell though.

5169
03:13:28,150 --> 03:13:28,610
Look.

5170
03:13:28,750 --> 03:13:28,850
I...

5171
03:13:28,850 --> 03:13:30,070
I did pull my weight.

5172
03:13:30,230 --> 03:13:30,830
I thought...

5173
03:13:30,830 --> 03:13:31,110
You know...

5174
03:13:31,110 --> 03:13:33,410
Since DJ Sneaky Snake did win...

5175
03:13:33,410 --> 03:13:34,490
He did win!

5176
03:13:35,690 --> 03:13:36,730
I thought...

5177
03:13:36,730 --> 03:13:39,070
He would have pulled this weight too.

5178
03:13:39,310 --> 03:13:39,650
I...

5179
03:13:39,650 --> 03:13:40,030
I...

5180
03:13:40,030 --> 03:13:40,350
Yeah.

5181
03:13:42,270 --> 03:13:45,030
I took him to hell because I thought we could make it.

5182
03:13:45,190 --> 03:13:46,110
I thought...

5183
03:13:46,830 --> 03:13:48,730
I thought we could have made it.

5184
03:13:49,070 --> 03:13:49,590
I...

5185
03:13:49,590 --> 03:13:51,030
I believe too hard.

5186
03:13:52,010 --> 03:13:54,450
I think I went down the bell curve, guys.

5187
03:14:03,600 --> 03:14:04,420
Don't worry.

5188
03:14:11,820 --> 03:14:12,700
This is it.

5189
03:14:12,900 --> 03:14:14,700
You absolutely did.

5190
03:14:18,520 --> 03:14:20,720
One day I get to play Sparrow again.

5191
03:14:29,040 --> 03:14:29,780
Don't worry.

5192
03:14:29,940 --> 03:14:30,420
I believe.

5193
03:14:30,800 --> 03:14:31,240
Look at me.

5194
03:14:31,320 --> 03:14:31,800
I'm a dev.

5195
03:14:35,020 --> 03:14:35,940
Look at me.

5196
03:14:36,660 --> 03:14:37,820
I'm a dev.

5197
03:14:38,820 --> 03:14:39,660
That's me.

5198
03:14:51,450 --> 03:14:52,450
Alright.

5199
03:14:58,290 --> 03:14:59,530
Let's go.

5200
03:15:08,000 --> 03:15:09,880
Not getting that gun.

5201
03:15:14,110 --> 03:15:15,090
JK.

5202
03:15:15,590 --> 03:15:16,970
I'm gonna get the gun.

5203
03:15:18,430 --> 03:15:20,610
I'm gonna grab my nemesis.

5204
03:15:21,830 --> 03:15:24,490
And now I'm gonna upgrade my nemesis.

5205
03:15:24,630 --> 03:15:26,190
And there's no consequences.

5206
03:15:29,370 --> 03:15:29,890
Oh.

5207
03:15:30,610 --> 03:15:32,350
There might be consequences.

5208
03:15:37,140 --> 03:15:38,000
People here?

5209
03:15:48,440 --> 03:15:48,960
No!

5210
03:15:49,440 --> 03:15:49,660
Fuck!

5211
03:15:49,820 --> 03:15:50,500
I have to reload.

5212
03:15:51,460 --> 03:15:52,200
It's okay.

5213
03:15:52,420 --> 03:15:53,220
Oh, he thirsted.

5214
03:15:53,320 --> 03:15:54,040
It's not okay.

5215
03:15:54,280 --> 03:15:55,480
I have to reload.

5216
03:15:55,480 --> 03:15:56,000
No!

5217
03:16:01,710 --> 03:16:02,150
Unlucky.

5218
03:16:02,690 --> 03:16:03,550
Wait, how much?

5219
03:16:03,690 --> 03:16:04,970
No, I want to see how much HP.

5220
03:16:05,230 --> 03:16:06,290
Let me expect it.

5221
03:16:06,770 --> 03:16:07,250
Oh my...

5222
03:16:07,250 --> 03:16:08,150
Wait, there was two?

5223
03:16:08,910 --> 03:16:10,210
There were still two more.

5224
03:16:10,290 --> 03:16:10,570
Oh, wait.

5225
03:16:10,670 --> 03:16:11,390
They got third party.

5226
03:16:11,670 --> 03:16:12,030
Yay!

5227
03:16:16,030 --> 03:16:17,050
I should have got vault.

5228
03:16:17,270 --> 03:16:18,370
I didn't realize there was a team.

5229
03:16:19,210 --> 03:16:20,930
Nemesis was not in.

5230
03:16:21,290 --> 03:16:21,730
Yay!

5231
03:16:22,110 --> 03:16:23,310
They get thirded!

5232
03:16:24,710 --> 03:16:25,150
Yippee!

5233
03:16:29,230 --> 03:16:30,970
That's all I care about!

5234
03:16:32,270 --> 03:16:33,130
Punished immediately.

5235
03:16:33,330 --> 03:16:34,610
Alright, they better lose this fight.

5236
03:16:36,010 --> 03:16:37,050
I swear to God.

5237
03:16:37,190 --> 03:16:40,190
I'm gonna fucking go running as ballistic if I have to deal with this.

5238
03:16:40,370 --> 03:16:41,510
I'm in it.

5239
03:16:43,010 --> 03:16:44,070
Oh my God.

5240
03:16:44,510 --> 03:16:45,990
Wait, and then they win?

5241
03:16:47,810 --> 03:16:49,010
This is not fair.

5242
03:16:51,070 --> 03:16:51,790
That's it.

5243
03:16:51,790 --> 03:16:53,610
This guy has inspired me.

5244
03:16:56,450 --> 03:16:57,410
That's it.

5245
03:16:57,650 --> 03:16:59,310
How dare they not get punished.

5246
03:16:59,690 --> 03:17:01,950
I am so inspired now.

5247
03:17:03,790 --> 03:17:06,030
Then she will hate watch.

5248
03:17:06,550 --> 03:17:09,530
How can I hate watch if they live?

5249
03:17:10,310 --> 03:17:12,190
I am inspired.

5250
03:17:12,190 --> 03:17:14,170
But then I lose my dev.

5251
03:17:14,870 --> 03:17:15,990
My dev powers.

5252
03:17:17,950 --> 03:17:20,090
She has the inspiration.

5253
03:17:21,350 --> 03:17:23,150
I heard ballistic gets banned a lot.

5254
03:17:25,210 --> 03:17:26,430
This is it.

5255
03:17:26,630 --> 03:17:28,210
I am inspired now.

5256
03:17:29,050 --> 03:17:30,430
I am inspired.

5257
03:17:35,230 --> 03:17:36,070
It's over.

5258
03:17:36,330 --> 03:17:37,610
I lose my dev bash.

5259
03:17:37,810 --> 03:17:38,810
But it's over.

5260
03:17:40,770 --> 03:17:41,690
I don't even know.

5261
03:17:42,110 --> 03:17:42,750
Were we...

5262
03:17:43,830 --> 03:17:45,450
Were we in...

5263
03:17:47,510 --> 03:17:48,490
Were we...

5264
03:17:48,490 --> 03:17:50,110
Did we move up in the bell curve?

5265
03:17:50,110 --> 03:17:54,690
Did we move up, guys?

5266
03:17:55,630 --> 03:17:56,930
That's all I need to know.

5267
03:17:59,510 --> 03:18:00,990
Do you know how to play...

5268
03:18:00,990 --> 03:18:02,830
Do you know how to play ballistic?

5269
03:18:03,470 --> 03:18:04,110
No.

5270
03:18:06,870 --> 03:18:08,750
But I got the spirit.

5271
03:18:10,130 --> 03:18:11,970
I got the spirit, boys.

5272
03:18:16,250 --> 03:18:17,210
It's okay.

5273
03:18:18,570 --> 03:18:19,890
I feel it.

5274
03:18:20,010 --> 03:18:21,090
I feel the energy.

5275
03:18:25,750 --> 03:18:27,590
That makes you happy.

5276
03:18:29,590 --> 03:18:30,930
I feel it.

5277
03:18:31,830 --> 03:18:33,810
I heard he's really good.

5278
03:18:37,400 --> 03:18:38,460
Oh my god.

5279
03:18:38,600 --> 03:18:39,640
I got so much spirit.

5280
03:18:39,980 --> 03:18:41,100
How about you?

5281
03:18:45,800 --> 03:18:48,200
I don't like being in the middle.

5282
03:18:48,480 --> 03:18:49,300
But it's okay.

5283
03:18:50,020 --> 03:18:51,920
It's not about what I like, I guess.

5284
03:18:59,480 --> 03:19:01,200
I forgot to...

5285
03:19:01,200 --> 03:19:02,500
I forgot to...

5286
03:19:07,040 --> 03:19:08,080
Oh my god.

5287
03:19:08,200 --> 03:19:09,120
It's the explosive arrows.

5288
03:19:09,640 --> 03:19:09,980
No!

5289
03:19:10,200 --> 03:19:11,300
It's the explosive arrows.

5290
03:19:11,300 --> 03:19:12,300
I forgot to...

5291
03:19:12,300 --> 03:19:12,960
Oh my god.

5292
03:19:13,380 --> 03:19:15,320
I forgot to rebuy...

5293
03:19:15,320 --> 03:19:16,020
The...

5294
03:19:16,020 --> 03:19:16,100
The...

5295
03:19:16,100 --> 03:19:16,980
R9 skin.

5296
03:19:17,280 --> 03:19:18,680
Oh my god.

5297
03:19:18,680 --> 03:19:19,740
This is hell.

5298
03:19:23,140 --> 03:19:26,620
I realized that it's not...

5299
03:19:26,620 --> 03:19:28,000
It's not the good one.

5300
03:19:28,460 --> 03:19:28,880
I am...

5301
03:19:31,820 --> 03:19:32,680
Oh man.

5302
03:19:33,320 --> 03:19:34,300
That's not good.

5303
03:19:35,240 --> 03:19:37,960
I don't know how to aim with this R9 skin.

5304
03:19:39,400 --> 03:19:40,480
I actually...

5305
03:19:40,480 --> 03:19:41,260
I do not know.

5306
03:19:41,840 --> 03:19:43,520
Guys, it's actually over for me.

5307
03:19:43,520 --> 03:19:45,080
That skin actually hurts me.

5308
03:19:45,680 --> 03:19:46,160
That...

5309
03:19:47,280 --> 03:19:49,680
No, I don't know how to use this...

5310
03:19:49,680 --> 03:19:50,540
Ironsight.

5311
03:19:50,760 --> 03:19:52,260
I need an actual...

5312
03:19:53,940 --> 03:19:54,640
Wait, where?

5313
03:19:55,440 --> 03:19:56,720
Oh, are we going to Oasis?

5314
03:20:00,900 --> 03:20:02,460
I'm not inspired anymore.

5315
03:20:03,840 --> 03:20:04,800
Increase alteration.

5316
03:20:04,980 --> 03:20:05,560
Should I get this?

5317
03:20:05,800 --> 03:20:07,280
I feel like that would be good, right?

5318
03:20:07,740 --> 03:20:08,420
I need...

5319
03:20:08,420 --> 03:20:10,620
I actually need like...

5320
03:20:10,620 --> 03:20:11,280
Not an enemy.

5321
03:20:11,440 --> 03:20:12,060
That was Cold Piercer.

5322
03:20:12,380 --> 03:20:13,100
Yeah, I'm coming.

5323
03:20:13,280 --> 03:20:13,460
I'm coming.

5324
03:20:14,020 --> 03:20:14,920
Alright, I'm here.

5325
03:20:15,360 --> 03:20:18,820
We're not far from the ring and have 10 seconds to find safe harbor.

5326
03:20:19,160 --> 03:20:19,960
Oh my god.

5327
03:20:20,220 --> 03:20:21,140
I need an 1x.

5328
03:20:22,240 --> 03:20:23,680
I actually don't know how to play.

5329
03:20:23,860 --> 03:20:25,020
I was so spoiled.

5330
03:20:25,480 --> 03:20:30,020
I played with my pay to win R9 skin for so long in my life that...

5331
03:20:30,020 --> 03:20:31,820
I've actually been so spoiled.

5332
03:20:34,300 --> 03:20:35,660
Yeah, I need a final 1x.

5333
03:20:35,980 --> 03:20:36,340
We're trailing.

5334
03:20:36,440 --> 03:20:36,920
We're trailing, brother.

5335
03:20:37,400 --> 03:20:38,920
We just need a final 1x.

5336
03:20:39,120 --> 03:20:39,840
Oh my god.

5337
03:20:39,840 --> 03:20:40,760
Don't worry, sir.

5338
03:20:43,920 --> 03:20:44,460
Don't worry.

5339
03:20:44,740 --> 03:20:45,400
Let's go in.

5340
03:20:47,800 --> 03:20:48,720
Do you have a 1x?

5341
03:20:48,860 --> 03:20:49,320
Oh my god.

5342
03:20:49,540 --> 03:20:50,040
Let's go.

5343
03:20:56,540 --> 03:20:57,440
There's no one here.

5344
03:20:57,900 --> 03:20:58,440
Wait, what?

5345
03:20:58,560 --> 03:20:59,920
I used my ult for no reason?

5346
03:21:02,820 --> 03:21:03,260
Usual?

5347
03:21:10,300 --> 03:21:10,980
There we go.

5348
03:21:11,680 --> 03:21:12,200
Hey, Sully.

5349
03:21:18,570 --> 03:21:19,010
Nice.

5350
03:21:26,460 --> 03:21:27,220
Oh my god.

5351
03:21:28,400 --> 03:21:29,540
Oh, I fucked up.

5352
03:21:29,780 --> 03:21:30,340
That was bad.

5353
03:21:30,640 --> 03:21:31,480
I egoed it.

5354
03:21:32,980 --> 03:21:34,080
I egoed that.

5355
03:21:34,440 --> 03:21:34,860
Oh my god.

5356
03:21:34,920 --> 03:21:35,700
Of course it's Daz.

5357
03:21:35,880 --> 03:21:36,700
I egoed it.

5358
03:21:36,780 --> 03:21:37,760
But I killed Sully though.

5359
03:21:37,920 --> 03:21:39,120
Wait, is this the actual Sully?

5360
03:21:41,160 --> 03:21:43,280
Was that the actual Sully Sully?

5361
03:21:43,600 --> 03:21:45,000
The Korean Sully?

5362
03:21:46,120 --> 03:21:46,460
Wait.

5363
03:21:47,320 --> 03:21:48,100
Isn't he?

5364
03:21:48,360 --> 03:21:48,560
No.

5365
03:21:48,960 --> 03:21:49,180
Right?

5366
03:21:49,760 --> 03:21:50,280
Yeah, no.

5367
03:21:50,320 --> 03:21:50,880
It was aggressive.

5368
03:21:51,120 --> 03:21:51,940
No, I...

5369
03:21:53,640 --> 03:21:54,440
I can't tell.

5370
03:21:54,860 --> 03:21:55,660
You're coming on 5.

5371
03:21:57,000 --> 03:21:58,380
I was way too embarrassed.

5372
03:21:58,560 --> 03:22:00,360
I thought it was...

5373
03:22:00,360 --> 03:22:01,160
One guy.

5374
03:22:02,040 --> 03:22:02,660
I got...

5375
03:22:02,660 --> 03:22:03,960
I had too much spirit, guys.

5376
03:22:05,060 --> 03:22:05,960
Too much spirit?

5377
03:22:06,140 --> 03:22:07,000
How about you?

5378
03:22:11,700 --> 03:22:12,360
Oh my god.

5379
03:22:12,380 --> 03:22:12,900
Look at that.

5380
03:22:13,100 --> 03:22:14,320
I wish I was on roller.

5381
03:22:23,160 --> 03:22:25,280
I wish I lived that life.

5382
03:22:26,720 --> 03:22:27,460
Oh my god.

5383
03:22:27,500 --> 03:22:28,080
Look at him go.

5384
03:22:28,260 --> 03:22:29,400
Oh, there's a third party.

5385
03:22:29,620 --> 03:22:31,180
There's a third party.

5386
03:22:31,480 --> 03:22:32,920
Oh, that's unlucky.

5387
03:22:37,940 --> 03:22:39,880
Yeah, I was like wondering if that was the real...

5388
03:22:39,880 --> 03:22:40,680
Oh my god, peeps.

5389
03:22:40,780 --> 03:22:41,460
He's doing it.

5390
03:22:42,000 --> 03:22:42,400
He's...

5391
03:22:42,400 --> 03:22:43,020
Oh my god.

5392
03:22:43,220 --> 03:22:44,040
Good job, peeps.

5393
03:22:44,140 --> 03:22:45,960
Okay, I should actually focus now.

5394
03:22:48,640 --> 03:22:51,020
There was like 7 teams here.

5395
03:22:52,080 --> 03:22:54,360
There was actually 7 teams.

5396
03:22:54,400 --> 03:22:55,280
Holy fuck.

5397
03:22:56,640 --> 03:22:59,200
Ah, the true Apex Legends experience.

5398
03:22:59,400 --> 03:23:00,200
How I missed you.

5399
03:23:02,500 --> 03:23:04,120
Are you serious, dad?

5400
03:23:04,420 --> 03:23:04,880
They...

5401
03:23:04,880 --> 03:23:05,940
They came in last.

5402
03:23:06,200 --> 03:23:06,720
They...

5403
03:23:06,720 --> 03:23:07,580
They...

5404
03:23:07,580 --> 03:23:09,060
They came in last.

5405
03:23:09,300 --> 03:23:10,920
And cleaned everything up.

5406
03:23:11,380 --> 03:23:12,480
Oh my...

5407
03:23:12,480 --> 03:23:13,480
I wish that was me.

5408
03:23:13,920 --> 03:23:15,060
Oh, DR9 skin.

5409
03:23:15,060 --> 03:23:15,460
You're right.

5410
03:23:15,660 --> 03:23:16,240
Let me go back.

5411
03:23:16,360 --> 03:23:17,480
I need to rebut.

5412
03:23:17,620 --> 03:23:18,140
I need to do it.

5413
03:23:18,760 --> 03:23:21,020
The true Thunderdome experience.

5414
03:23:22,020 --> 03:23:22,460
Alright.

5415
03:23:24,840 --> 03:23:25,800
Let's see.

5416
03:23:25,960 --> 03:23:26,400
Banners.

5417
03:23:27,000 --> 03:23:28,360
Before I do that...

5418
03:23:29,280 --> 03:23:30,040
Before...

5419
03:23:30,040 --> 03:23:31,840
This is more important.

5420
03:23:32,220 --> 03:23:33,780
Before I do this.

5421
03:23:34,200 --> 03:23:36,620
This is much more important.

5422
03:23:38,940 --> 03:23:40,060
And then...

5423
03:23:40,060 --> 03:23:40,200
And then...

5424
03:23:40,600 --> 03:23:41,900
Don't worry, guys.

5425
03:23:42,260 --> 03:23:43,260
I got this.

5426
03:23:43,760 --> 03:23:43,900
No.

5427
03:23:46,180 --> 03:23:46,920
Oh wait.

5428
03:23:46,920 --> 03:23:47,740
I almost forgot...

5429
03:23:48,040 --> 03:23:50,080
The actual thing I was supposed to do.

5430
03:23:52,160 --> 03:23:52,720
Sorry.

5431
03:23:53,180 --> 03:23:53,740
Now...

5432
03:23:53,740 --> 03:23:54,600
Now this is...

5433
03:23:54,600 --> 03:23:55,820
Where's my usual gun?

5434
03:23:56,400 --> 03:23:57,420
Where is it?

5435
03:23:57,900 --> 03:23:58,460
No.

5436
03:23:58,780 --> 03:23:59,080
There...

5437
03:23:59,080 --> 03:23:59,460
Oh, here.

5438
03:23:59,580 --> 03:24:00,420
This is the one I use.

5439
03:24:00,500 --> 03:24:01,360
I always use zero point.

5440
03:24:01,360 --> 03:24:04,020
The reason why this is pay to win is...

5441
03:24:04,020 --> 03:24:05,180
You can see here.

5442
03:24:06,500 --> 03:24:07,540
This is...

5443
03:24:07,540 --> 03:24:08,980
Here is a circle, right?

5444
03:24:09,180 --> 03:24:10,540
And it blocks everything.

5445
03:24:10,800 --> 03:24:11,660
Right here.

5446
03:24:11,860 --> 03:24:12,940
It blocks everything.

5447
03:24:13,260 --> 03:24:15,320
But here is like a straight line.

5448
03:24:15,620 --> 03:24:16,200
So like...

5449
03:24:16,200 --> 03:24:18,280
The head fits in more.

5450
03:24:18,680 --> 03:24:20,180
That's why this is pay to win.

5451
03:24:20,180 --> 03:24:21,040
So always...

5452
03:24:21,040 --> 03:24:22,360
When you play R9...

5453
03:24:22,360 --> 03:24:23,780
You'll just use...

5454
03:24:23,780 --> 03:24:24,780
Just get like...

5455
03:24:24,780 --> 03:24:26,180
Any scope that has this.

5456
03:24:26,900 --> 03:24:27,460
Because like...

5457
03:24:27,460 --> 03:24:28,720
This shit is fucking ass.

5458
03:24:28,880 --> 03:24:30,080
I cannot see anything.

5459
03:24:34,730 --> 03:24:35,450
It's dumb.

5460
03:24:35,650 --> 03:24:35,870
Like...

5461
03:24:35,870 --> 03:24:37,430
It's dumb that they have pay to win skins.

5462
03:24:37,530 --> 03:24:38,430
I hate that concept.

5463
03:24:38,650 --> 03:24:39,590
It's same with...

5464
03:24:39,590 --> 03:24:40,070
R9.

5465
03:24:40,350 --> 03:24:40,470
Okay.

5466
03:24:40,510 --> 03:24:41,350
The reason why...

5467
03:24:41,350 --> 03:24:43,010
Is because this R9...

5468
03:24:43,010 --> 03:24:44,590
This wingman skin...

5469
03:24:44,590 --> 03:24:46,210
This wingman skin...

5470
03:24:46,210 --> 03:24:46,890
Is skinnier.

5471
03:24:47,170 --> 03:24:48,170
If you look at this...

5472
03:24:48,170 --> 03:24:48,910
It's bulkier.

5473
03:24:49,090 --> 03:24:50,150
Also like...

5474
03:24:50,150 --> 03:24:52,910
Like you can see how much bulkier this is.

5475
03:24:53,090 --> 03:24:54,590
Compared to this.

5476
03:24:55,170 --> 03:24:56,330
Because it's more like...

5477
03:24:57,050 --> 03:24:58,370
It's more like...

5478
03:24:58,370 --> 03:24:58,870
You know...

5479
03:24:58,870 --> 03:24:59,530
Rectangular.

5480
03:24:59,890 --> 03:25:01,430
And then this one is like...

5481
03:25:01,430 --> 03:25:01,630
You know...

5482
03:25:01,630 --> 03:25:02,350
There's like a...

5483
03:25:02,350 --> 03:25:03,070
Thing...

5484
03:25:03,070 --> 03:25:04,390
Jucting out right here.

5485
03:25:04,790 --> 03:25:05,310
And...

5486
03:25:05,310 --> 03:25:06,390
I don't know if that was a word.

5487
03:25:06,410 --> 03:25:07,450
I made up a word.

5488
03:25:09,150 --> 03:25:10,870
And I know that...

5489
03:25:10,870 --> 03:25:12,770
Flatline also has...

5490
03:25:12,770 --> 03:25:13,670
Something like it.

5491
03:25:13,890 --> 03:25:14,210
But...

5492
03:25:14,210 --> 03:25:17,170
I somehow managed to be able to aim without...

5493
03:25:17,170 --> 03:25:17,950
What's...

5494
03:25:17,950 --> 03:25:18,530
Assault rifle?

5495
03:25:19,710 --> 03:25:20,230
Flatline.

5496
03:25:20,530 --> 03:25:20,790
Okay.

5497
03:25:20,930 --> 03:25:21,630
For flatline.

5498
03:25:23,650 --> 03:25:25,090
I don't remember which one is.

5499
03:25:25,210 --> 03:25:25,670
Is it...

5500
03:25:25,670 --> 03:25:26,370
It's also similar.

5501
03:25:26,530 --> 03:25:26,670
Yeah.

5502
03:25:26,850 --> 03:25:27,810
It's also the scope.

5503
03:25:28,210 --> 03:25:29,130
I'm pretty sure.

5504
03:25:29,270 --> 03:25:29,410
Right?

5505
03:25:32,330 --> 03:25:33,290
Default is...

5506
03:25:33,290 --> 03:25:34,070
What's default?

5507
03:25:35,390 --> 03:25:36,090
What's default?

5508
03:25:36,310 --> 03:25:37,030
Default is this.

5509
03:25:37,870 --> 03:25:38,830
And then...

5510
03:25:39,850 --> 03:25:42,130
The good one is also like...

5511
03:25:42,130 --> 03:25:43,230
The heatsink.

5512
03:25:43,330 --> 03:25:43,470
Yeah.

5513
03:25:43,950 --> 03:25:44,990
This is the...

5514
03:25:44,990 --> 03:25:45,650
Play-Doh win skin.

5515
03:25:46,590 --> 03:25:47,790
It takes less time.

5516
03:25:47,930 --> 03:25:48,050
Yeah.

5517
03:25:49,430 --> 03:25:50,510
This doesn't have it anymore.

5518
03:25:50,650 --> 03:25:51,350
Did they fix it?

5519
03:25:51,710 --> 03:25:52,650
Oh, they fixed it?

5520
03:25:52,870 --> 03:25:53,110
Okay.

5521
03:25:54,770 --> 03:25:55,570
Oh, it did they?

5522
03:25:55,950 --> 03:25:56,410
Nice.

5523
03:25:56,650 --> 03:25:57,070
I'm glad.

5524
03:25:59,550 --> 03:26:00,470
I remember...

5525
03:26:00,930 --> 03:26:01,390
Shotgun...

5526
03:26:01,390 --> 03:26:02,950
Peacekeeper had a...

5527
03:26:02,950 --> 03:26:03,970
Had one too.

5528
03:26:04,470 --> 03:26:06,510
But I don't remember what it was.

5529
03:26:06,550 --> 03:26:07,130
Because, like...

5530
03:26:07,130 --> 03:26:08,530
I didn't care too much about it.

5531
03:26:08,990 --> 03:26:09,450
But...

5532
03:26:09,450 --> 03:26:11,150
I know Peacekeeper also had it.

5533
03:26:11,170 --> 03:26:12,430
It was the iron sight as well.

5534
03:26:12,430 --> 03:26:15,370
But I don't remember a lot about the PK.

5535
03:26:17,790 --> 03:26:18,350
Um...

5536
03:26:19,050 --> 03:26:20,370
I'm not like...

5537
03:26:20,370 --> 03:26:21,770
I mean, this is like knowledge.

5538
03:26:22,290 --> 03:26:22,790
Uh...

5539
03:26:22,790 --> 03:26:23,710
This is like the...

5540
03:26:23,710 --> 03:26:26,450
Like been common knowledge since the beginning of Apex.

5541
03:26:26,690 --> 03:26:27,050
That...

5542
03:26:27,050 --> 03:26:29,910
A lot of these skins are like...

5543
03:26:29,910 --> 03:26:30,810
Pay to win.

5544
03:26:31,070 --> 03:26:32,570
Because they have better iron sight.

5545
03:26:32,710 --> 03:26:34,510
And that's why people always...

5546
03:26:34,510 --> 03:26:35,750
When they're on New York...

5547
03:26:35,750 --> 03:26:37,910
They always ask people to reskin their guns.

5548
03:26:38,210 --> 03:26:39,070
Because like...

5549
03:26:39,070 --> 03:26:40,370
If they don't have this...

5550
03:26:40,370 --> 03:26:41,210
Back then...

5551
03:26:41,210 --> 03:26:42,030
Back then...

5552
03:26:42,030 --> 03:26:44,010
When people didn't have this pay to win skin.

5553
03:26:44,350 --> 03:26:45,630
They would like...

5554
03:26:45,630 --> 03:26:45,850
Ask...

5555
03:26:45,850 --> 03:26:46,350
They would like...

5556
03:26:46,350 --> 03:26:47,610
Stack with players...

5557
03:26:47,610 --> 03:26:49,150
That had the pay to win skin.

5558
03:26:49,590 --> 03:26:50,550
And then they'll be like...

5559
03:26:50,550 --> 03:26:51,670
Can you reskin my gun?

5560
03:26:52,170 --> 03:26:52,570
Like...

5561
03:26:52,570 --> 03:26:53,110
And like...

5562
03:26:53,110 --> 03:26:53,750
If they want to...

5563
03:26:53,750 --> 03:26:54,210
Like you know...

5564
03:26:54,210 --> 03:26:55,130
If they still want to have it...

5565
03:26:55,130 --> 03:26:55,730
They'll just be like...

5566
03:26:55,730 --> 03:26:56,150
Oh yeah...

5567
03:26:56,150 --> 03:26:57,130
Can you reskin my gun?

5568
03:26:57,310 --> 03:26:58,770
But obviously everyone has it now.

5569
03:26:58,890 --> 03:26:59,550
Because like...

5570
03:26:59,550 --> 03:27:00,410
It takes...

5571
03:27:00,410 --> 03:27:02,170
People have already built enough money...

5572
03:27:02,170 --> 03:27:03,450
To have the skins now.

5573
03:27:03,770 --> 03:27:04,710
And then...

5574
03:27:04,710 --> 03:27:05,250
Yeah...

5575
03:27:05,250 --> 03:27:05,850
I would do that.

5576
03:27:06,010 --> 03:27:06,230
I would...

5577
03:27:06,230 --> 03:27:08,110
I remember when I had to start a new account.

5578
03:27:08,690 --> 03:27:09,770
And then I...

5579
03:27:09,770 --> 03:27:10,270
Would be like...

5580
03:27:10,270 --> 03:27:10,970
I'm playing with someone.

5581
03:27:10,970 --> 03:27:13,130
And then, like, you know, I'd be like, do you have the skin?

5582
03:27:13,330 --> 03:27:14,690
And I was like, can you reskin my gun?

5583
03:27:15,030 --> 03:27:17,230
Because then I have to regrind all the skins again.

5584
03:27:17,630 --> 03:27:18,990
Like, all my pay-to-win skins.

5585
03:27:19,010 --> 03:27:20,610
Because I fucking hate playing.

5586
03:27:21,030 --> 03:27:23,150
I fucking hate playing with the defaults.

5587
03:27:23,230 --> 03:27:28,590
Because I was so used... I had so many hours in this game using the default skins.

5588
03:27:28,750 --> 03:27:29,650
Oh my god!

5589
03:27:29,970 --> 03:27:31,550
I'm pushing the rock!

5590
03:27:34,530 --> 03:27:35,490
Oh my god!

5591
03:27:35,730 --> 03:27:38,670
This is the highest I've ever been on the bell curve!

5592
03:27:38,670 --> 03:27:41,530
And there's only two of us!

5593
03:27:42,030 --> 03:27:42,430
Okay.

5594
03:27:43,470 --> 03:27:44,190
Um...

5595
03:27:45,870 --> 03:27:46,590
Wait!

5596
03:27:47,310 --> 03:27:49,190
If we were down...

5597
03:27:49,190 --> 03:27:50,390
Wait a minute!

5598
03:27:50,750 --> 03:27:55,370
How fucked up were my teammates to pull me down the bell curve?

5599
03:27:55,790 --> 03:27:57,090
That low!

5600
03:28:00,930 --> 03:28:07,850
If two of us are in the middle of the bell curve, how fucking bad were my teammates?

5601
03:28:08,670 --> 03:28:09,350
How...

5602
03:28:15,770 --> 03:28:17,950
Oh my god!

5603
03:28:18,590 --> 03:28:21,530
How fucked were they pulling me down?

5604
03:28:25,490 --> 03:28:28,230
The answer is yes.

5605
03:28:31,950 --> 03:28:33,290
Oh my god!

5606
03:28:33,670 --> 03:28:34,990
And it's just two of us.

5607
03:28:35,130 --> 03:28:36,810
Just the two of us.

5608
03:28:37,230 --> 03:28:39,870
Bum bum ba dum bum ba dum.

5609
03:28:40,370 --> 03:28:42,170
Just the two of us.

5610
03:28:46,030 --> 03:28:50,450
I can't believe two of us managed to be a high...

5611
03:28:50,450 --> 03:28:52,590
higher on the bell curve.

5612
03:28:52,830 --> 03:28:53,270
Higher on the bell curve.

5613
03:28:53,270 --> 03:28:54,550
That's so fucked!

5614
03:28:57,390 --> 03:29:02,270
It puts into perspective how fucked up my team was during the entire time.

5615
03:29:07,930 --> 03:29:09,070
I'm not running that.

5616
03:29:09,090 --> 03:29:10,270
I've learned my lesson.

5617
03:29:10,750 --> 03:29:12,210
I've learned my lesson!

5618
03:29:16,390 --> 03:29:17,770
How about I get an R&A?

5619
03:29:22,110 --> 03:29:23,710
After everything I've been through.

5620
03:29:25,990 --> 03:29:27,370
Oh my god, I hear so...

5621
03:29:27,370 --> 03:29:28,330
Oh my god, nice!

5622
03:29:31,350 --> 03:29:31,850
Nice!

5623
03:29:36,010 --> 03:29:38,670
I really want to fight really badly.

5624
03:29:41,490 --> 03:29:45,730
But it's just two of us, so I understand that he's like a little hesitant.

5625
03:29:46,390 --> 03:29:48,050
Um, I get it.

5626
03:29:49,450 --> 03:29:51,730
I understand, I hear you.

5627
03:29:57,230 --> 03:29:58,950
Wait, I need to find...

5628
03:29:58,950 --> 03:29:59,970
Wait, does he...

5629
03:29:59,970 --> 03:30:00,270
What?

5630
03:30:00,470 --> 03:30:01,370
Where does he want to go?

5631
03:30:01,770 --> 03:30:02,310
I'm ready when you are.

5632
03:30:02,710 --> 03:30:02,990
Oh.

5633
03:30:03,810 --> 03:30:04,990
Alright, let's go.

5634
03:30:07,830 --> 03:30:10,250
But, just the two of us.

5635
03:30:10,810 --> 03:30:13,230
Bum bum ba dum bum ba dum.

5636
03:30:13,630 --> 03:30:15,190
Just the two of us.

5637
03:30:15,910 --> 03:30:16,750
Jesus Christ.

5638
03:30:17,690 --> 03:30:18,490
Apparently not.

5639
03:30:19,650 --> 03:30:21,610
I should put one in my sling, if.

5640
03:30:21,730 --> 03:30:22,150
Fuck it.

5641
03:30:22,330 --> 03:30:23,130
Not really here.

5642
03:30:23,730 --> 03:30:24,590
Too much.

5643
03:30:26,410 --> 03:30:27,710
Always wanted a brother.

5644
03:30:28,170 --> 03:30:28,290
Oh.

5645
03:30:30,270 --> 03:30:31,770
Oh, I don't know if he saw me.

5646
03:30:32,330 --> 03:30:33,650
I don't know if he saw me.

5647
03:30:33,750 --> 03:30:37,070
When you kill Lita, absolutely disgusting effort.

5648
03:30:40,990 --> 03:30:41,910
What the f...

5649
03:30:43,090 --> 03:30:44,210
That's actually fucked up.

5650
03:30:44,290 --> 03:30:44,870
Did you guys see that?

5651
03:30:44,930 --> 03:30:45,990
I hit an entire mag too.

5652
03:30:46,930 --> 03:30:47,850
I'm so sad.

5653
03:30:48,030 --> 03:30:49,390
I actually hit an entire mag for that.

5654
03:30:49,390 --> 03:30:50,210
Reloaded.

5655
03:30:54,260 --> 03:30:54,600
Reloaded.

5656
03:30:54,600 --> 03:30:54,720
Reloaded.

5657
03:30:54,720 --> 03:30:54,900
You're killing up.

5658
03:30:55,000 --> 03:30:55,660
I'm...

5659
03:30:55,660 --> 03:30:56,200
I...

5660
03:30:56,700 --> 03:30:58,200
Several no regs.

5661
03:30:58,340 --> 03:30:58,800
That...

5662
03:30:58,800 --> 03:30:59,720
I'm sad.

5663
03:31:01,220 --> 03:31:03,140
I'm so sad.

5664
03:31:04,280 --> 03:31:05,360
I...

5665
03:31:05,360 --> 03:31:08,300
I hit several no regs for that.

5666
03:31:08,960 --> 03:31:10,040
I'm...

5667
03:31:10,040 --> 03:31:10,400
Okay.

5668
03:31:11,440 --> 03:31:12,520
That's...

5669
03:31:14,480 --> 03:31:15,680
That's fine.

5670
03:31:23,520 --> 03:31:24,860
That's fine.

5671
03:31:25,180 --> 03:31:25,860
That's fine.

5672
03:31:26,140 --> 03:31:26,980
That's fine.

5673
03:31:29,500 --> 03:31:30,280
That's...

5674
03:31:30,280 --> 03:31:31,560
That's fine.

5675
03:31:31,960 --> 03:31:34,560
I'm okay with hitting several no regs.

5676
03:31:35,500 --> 03:31:35,890
I'm...

5677
03:31:39,040 --> 03:31:39,820
I'm...

5678
03:31:39,820 --> 03:31:42,580
The world is out to get me.

5679
03:31:45,460 --> 03:31:47,620
There's no way the world isn't out to get me.

5680
03:31:47,720 --> 03:31:48,120
I refuse.

5681
03:31:54,410 --> 03:31:55,390
I'm just gonna put it there.

5682
03:31:55,610 --> 03:31:56,410
And then there's him.

5683
03:31:58,790 --> 03:32:00,250
The world hates me.

5684
03:32:06,280 --> 03:32:07,160
Jesus Christ.

5685
03:32:10,940 --> 03:32:12,140
Oh my god.

5686
03:32:12,720 --> 03:32:14,400
The world hates me.

5687
03:32:17,660 --> 03:32:18,100
Wait.

5688
03:32:18,180 --> 03:32:19,460
How do I put this in my sling?

5689
03:32:19,500 --> 03:32:19,660
Okay.

5690
03:32:19,740 --> 03:32:20,080
There you go.

5691
03:32:20,660 --> 03:32:21,100
Alright.

5692
03:32:21,580 --> 03:32:21,960
Jesus.

5693
03:32:22,200 --> 03:32:23,400
This fight was never gonna end.

5694
03:32:23,900 --> 03:32:26,040
I don't think this fight is gonna end, guys.

5695
03:32:30,160 --> 03:32:30,600
Wait.

5696
03:32:30,680 --> 03:32:31,200
There's people here.

5697
03:32:31,860 --> 03:32:32,200
Wait.

5698
03:32:34,080 --> 03:32:35,600
There's a little bit of team right here.

5699
03:32:38,320 --> 03:32:39,500
Me and my guy.

5700
03:32:40,180 --> 03:32:40,960
We're scared.

5701
03:32:54,080 --> 03:32:56,080
Oh, I thought the bullet would be closer.

5702
03:32:56,220 --> 03:32:56,780
Not gonna lie.

5703
03:32:58,940 --> 03:32:59,380
Okay.

5704
03:32:59,500 --> 03:32:59,640
Nice.

5705
03:32:59,820 --> 03:32:59,980
Okay.

5706
03:33:05,600 --> 03:33:06,420
Oh my god.

5707
03:33:06,420 --> 03:33:07,380
I'm not okay.

5708
03:33:07,620 --> 03:33:07,980
I'm not okay.

5709
03:33:08,000 --> 03:33:08,360
Hey, look.

5710
03:33:10,600 --> 03:33:11,120
Alright.

5711
03:33:12,100 --> 03:33:12,620
Nice.

5712
03:33:15,640 --> 03:33:18,980
Just in case I need to, you know, use my ult.

5713
03:33:20,460 --> 03:33:21,480
Just in case.

5714
03:33:25,540 --> 03:33:29,160
I swear to god, if there's another team that decides to go, like, fuck you.

5715
03:33:29,320 --> 03:33:30,060
I swear to god.

5716
03:33:30,540 --> 03:33:30,920
I...

5717
03:33:32,380 --> 03:33:35,800
That we had to fight, like, we had to fight, like, ten hundred teams just now.

5718
03:33:36,280 --> 03:33:38,120
I am not having it.

5719
03:33:38,280 --> 03:33:38,600
I...

5720
03:33:42,860 --> 03:33:43,760
I don't know.

5721
03:33:43,920 --> 03:33:44,980
I don't know if there's another team.

5722
03:33:45,200 --> 03:33:45,740
Can't tell.

5723
03:33:45,880 --> 03:33:46,400
I'm scared.

5724
03:33:46,780 --> 03:33:47,980
I'm scared, man.

5725
03:33:48,320 --> 03:33:48,940
I'm so...

5726
03:33:48,940 --> 03:33:49,100
Why?

5727
03:33:49,200 --> 03:33:49,960
I don't want to lead.

5728
03:33:50,340 --> 03:33:50,840
I don't...

5729
03:33:50,840 --> 03:33:51,600
I don't...

5730
03:33:51,600 --> 03:33:53,300
Why am I leading?

5731
03:33:53,880 --> 03:33:55,200
Stop following me!

5732
03:33:55,500 --> 03:33:55,880
Stop!

5733
03:33:56,880 --> 03:33:57,780
Oh my god.

5734
03:33:57,900 --> 03:33:58,680
I fucking knew it.

5735
03:33:58,760 --> 03:33:59,240
I knew it.

5736
03:33:59,320 --> 03:33:59,620
I knew.

5737
03:33:59,740 --> 03:34:00,580
I fucking knew it.

5738
03:34:01,240 --> 03:34:02,380
I fucking knew it.

5739
03:34:07,620 --> 03:34:09,800
This is why I did not want to lead.

5740
03:34:13,290 --> 03:34:14,230
Jesus Christ.

5741
03:34:14,410 --> 03:34:15,030
I'm fucking dead.

5742
03:34:15,150 --> 03:34:15,950
I'm fucking dead to this.

5743
03:34:23,420 --> 03:34:24,240
This is...

5744
03:34:24,240 --> 03:34:25,520
This is my hubris.

5745
03:34:25,920 --> 03:34:26,520
This is...

5746
03:34:27,720 --> 03:34:28,200
Like...

5747
03:34:28,960 --> 03:34:31,080
Why are they were all there?

5748
03:34:31,660 --> 03:34:33,920
And this is a third party?

5749
03:34:33,920 --> 03:34:36,680
How could there be a third team?

5750
03:34:37,260 --> 03:34:37,780
How?

5751
03:34:41,340 --> 03:34:44,500
How was there a third team?

5752
03:34:45,320 --> 03:34:45,920
How?

5753
03:34:46,600 --> 03:34:48,380
I stayed there.

5754
03:34:48,740 --> 03:34:50,160
And there was still...

5755
03:34:50,160 --> 03:34:53,300
There was still a third team.

5756
03:34:53,880 --> 03:34:55,600
That's actually crazy.

5757
03:34:56,340 --> 03:34:56,820
I...

5758
03:34:58,460 --> 03:35:01,400
Why do they want this tiny room?

5759
03:35:01,740 --> 03:35:03,480
Oh, I'm back down the...

5760
03:35:03,480 --> 03:35:05,240
Oh, they rolled me back down.

5761
03:35:05,440 --> 03:35:06,060
They...

5762
03:35:06,060 --> 03:35:09,220
They rolled me back down the hill.

5763
03:35:09,740 --> 03:35:12,660
And so the bow, they rolls back down.

5764
03:35:13,360 --> 03:35:14,440
The hill.

5765
03:35:16,250 --> 03:35:17,040
Did you...

5766
03:35:17,040 --> 03:35:18,800
Not the bell curve.

5767
03:35:19,920 --> 03:35:20,500
No!

5768
03:35:22,960 --> 03:35:24,080
I'm sad.

5769
03:35:24,500 --> 03:35:26,020
Maybe I was never...

5770
03:35:26,020 --> 03:35:28,320
It was never meant to be a ballistic player.

5771
03:35:28,320 --> 03:35:31,920
They gave you a third teammate.

5772
03:35:35,580 --> 03:35:37,780
Like, I have to be so fucking...

5773
03:35:37,780 --> 03:35:38,320
Oh my god.

5774
03:35:38,480 --> 03:35:40,200
I have to play so paranoid too.

5775
03:35:42,420 --> 03:35:44,300
I'm playing incredibly paranoid.

5776
03:35:44,360 --> 03:35:45,300
Every time.

5777
03:35:50,090 --> 03:35:50,530
Oh.

5778
03:35:53,910 --> 03:35:55,410
I think that's like...

5779
03:35:55,410 --> 03:35:58,110
I forgot how paranoid it makes me when I play Apex.

5780
03:36:00,490 --> 03:36:01,890
I'm never safe.

5781
03:36:02,130 --> 03:36:03,130
That's the secret.

5782
03:36:06,470 --> 03:36:07,790
Hey, let's land there.

5783
03:36:08,370 --> 03:36:10,210
Alright, down I go.

5784
03:36:13,630 --> 03:36:14,970
Down I go.

5785
03:36:15,710 --> 03:36:16,270
I do...

5786
03:36:16,270 --> 03:36:17,990
I like never left that area.

5787
03:36:18,170 --> 03:36:19,190
That was the worst part.

5788
03:36:19,350 --> 03:36:20,510
I never left.

5789
03:36:20,510 --> 03:36:22,270
I literally...

5790
03:36:22,270 --> 03:36:25,670
I got down and it was like party time.

5791
03:36:27,310 --> 03:36:29,570
It's like, this is your home now.

5792
03:36:29,990 --> 03:36:32,470
And like seven different people died.

5793
03:36:32,710 --> 03:36:34,550
Seven different teams died there.

5794
03:36:36,090 --> 03:36:37,830
From that one encounter.

5795
03:36:38,570 --> 03:36:39,550
Oh my god, thank god.

5796
03:36:43,120 --> 03:36:44,860
I forgot how that was like.

5797
03:36:46,600 --> 03:36:49,580
I forgot how that was like to live in the mosh pit.

5798
03:36:53,140 --> 03:36:54,160
Alright, nice.

5799
03:36:59,260 --> 03:37:00,220
You know what?

5800
03:37:00,520 --> 03:37:01,700
Maybe I can make it...

5801
03:37:01,700 --> 03:37:02,480
No, I can't.

5802
03:37:02,600 --> 03:37:04,300
Don't lie to yourself, Doki.

5803
03:37:08,600 --> 03:37:10,200
Don't lie to yourself.

5804
03:37:13,380 --> 03:37:15,300
You know you can't make...

5805
03:37:15,300 --> 03:37:16,680
Make it work.

5806
03:37:21,880 --> 03:37:22,440
How?

5807
03:37:22,440 --> 03:37:22,620
How?

5808
03:37:24,480 --> 03:37:25,500
Oh, that's how.

5809
03:37:25,700 --> 03:37:26,080
Controller?

5810
03:37:33,120 --> 03:37:33,780
That's how.

5811
03:37:38,660 --> 03:37:40,040
Alright, that's fine.

5812
03:37:40,560 --> 03:37:42,060
I'm fine to die in this hole.

5813
03:37:49,090 --> 03:37:50,890
Oh my god, I fucking thermite myself.

5814
03:37:51,130 --> 03:37:51,330
Whoops.

5815
03:37:52,010 --> 03:37:52,730
That's my bad.

5816
03:37:55,590 --> 03:37:56,070
Okay.

5817
03:37:56,350 --> 03:37:57,590
That's actually my bad.

5818
03:37:57,590 --> 03:37:58,570
I thermited myself.

5819
03:37:58,750 --> 03:38:00,010
I thought I got it correctly.

5820
03:38:00,290 --> 03:38:01,210
But I didn't.

5821
03:38:06,260 --> 03:38:07,740
God, you're so bad though.

5822
03:38:09,240 --> 03:38:10,280
Oh my god.

5823
03:38:10,420 --> 03:38:12,740
If I didn't accidentally thermite myself...

5824
03:38:15,560 --> 03:38:16,500
If I...

5825
03:38:16,500 --> 03:38:19,100
If I didn't accidentally thermite myself...

5826
03:38:19,100 --> 03:38:20,000
I could have...

5827
03:38:20,000 --> 03:38:20,960
Pulled through it.

5828
03:38:21,260 --> 03:38:21,680
I...

5829
03:38:21,680 --> 03:38:22,720
I...

5830
03:38:25,800 --> 03:38:27,480
I'm just trying to figure...

5831
03:38:27,480 --> 03:38:29,900
My god, I forgot to thermite position.

5832
03:38:31,340 --> 03:38:32,100
All good.

5833
03:38:32,620 --> 03:38:33,240
All good.

5834
03:38:33,540 --> 03:38:35,820
I literally got her 100 to 0.

5835
03:38:36,680 --> 03:38:37,200
Bro, hitting...

5836
03:38:37,200 --> 03:38:38,720
Well, you know, can't get it all.

5837
03:38:39,060 --> 03:38:42,040
It was a psychological that made him think you were bad.

5838
03:38:42,220 --> 03:38:44,060
So he would 1v1.

5839
03:38:44,500 --> 03:38:45,060
Totally.

5840
03:38:45,340 --> 03:38:47,380
That was a low bell curve.

5841
03:38:47,760 --> 03:38:49,360
I had a good idea.

5842
03:38:49,640 --> 03:38:52,240
But I failed the execution of the name.

5843
03:38:52,240 --> 03:38:53,080
I was...

5844
03:38:53,080 --> 03:38:55,040
I didn't aim it correctly.

5845
03:38:56,880 --> 03:38:57,440
Um...

5846
03:38:58,060 --> 03:38:58,620
I...

5847
03:38:58,620 --> 03:39:00,140
I didn't...

5848
03:39:00,140 --> 03:39:01,460
I had to do it like...

5849
03:39:01,460 --> 03:39:03,760
I had to do it in a way where I didn't...

5850
03:39:03,760 --> 03:39:04,780
Fuck myself up.

5851
03:39:05,960 --> 03:39:07,120
But I did.

5852
03:39:12,130 --> 03:39:13,050
But like...

5853
03:39:13,050 --> 03:39:15,090
The fact that he lost that 1v1...

5854
03:39:15,090 --> 03:39:16,890
Was very embarrassing for him.

5855
03:39:18,290 --> 03:39:18,850
Was...

5856
03:39:20,510 --> 03:39:21,990
That was embarrassing.

5857
03:39:22,470 --> 03:39:24,110
Because I was like...

5858
03:39:24,110 --> 03:39:24,550
1v1.

5859
03:39:24,550 --> 03:39:25,530
I had no shields.

5860
03:39:31,630 --> 03:39:32,970
Maybe I'll find...

5861
03:39:32,970 --> 03:39:33,930
I'll find something.

5862
03:39:37,390 --> 03:39:38,810
Ruby's bell cruiser.

5863
03:39:39,210 --> 03:39:39,790
Alright.

5864
03:39:40,110 --> 03:39:41,030
I'll focus up.

5865
03:39:41,170 --> 03:39:41,710
I'll focus up.

5866
03:39:41,770 --> 03:39:42,270
I only have like...

5867
03:39:42,270 --> 03:39:43,930
15 minutes left at the...

5868
03:39:43,930 --> 03:39:44,690
Early access.

5869
03:39:48,750 --> 03:39:50,150
15 minutes left.

5870
03:39:56,980 --> 03:39:57,460
Alright.

5871
03:39:58,560 --> 03:39:59,580
I'll focus up.

5872
03:39:59,720 --> 03:40:00,200
I prom...

5873
03:40:00,200 --> 03:40:01,120
I'll lock in, guys.

5874
03:40:01,340 --> 03:40:01,900
I promise.

5875
03:40:02,360 --> 03:40:03,600
No more fucking around.

5876
03:40:04,540 --> 03:40:05,400
I'll lock in.

5877
03:40:05,500 --> 03:40:06,580
I'll play with my guns.

5878
03:40:10,080 --> 03:40:10,560
Okay.

5879
03:40:10,560 --> 03:40:11,320
I'll lock in.

5880
03:40:11,720 --> 03:40:12,880
This is it, guys.

5881
03:40:13,120 --> 03:40:14,220
I'm locking in.

5882
03:40:15,520 --> 03:40:16,000
15.

5883
03:40:16,300 --> 03:40:17,420
It closes at 1.

5884
03:40:17,600 --> 03:40:18,620
That's why I was like...

5885
03:40:18,620 --> 03:40:18,660
Oh.

5886
03:40:19,200 --> 03:40:19,840
They only have...

5887
03:40:19,840 --> 03:40:21,100
But then the thing that sucks...

5888
03:40:21,100 --> 03:40:22,640
Is that it starts at 9am.

5889
03:40:22,920 --> 03:40:24,300
Like, that's the thing that I hate.

5890
03:40:24,740 --> 03:40:25,760
I hate that...

5891
03:40:25,760 --> 03:40:27,740
The play test starts at 9am.

5892
03:40:28,660 --> 03:40:29,180
Um...

5893
03:40:29,180 --> 03:40:30,560
And then it closes at 1pm.

5894
03:40:30,780 --> 03:40:33,400
But it makes sense because they want to make sure that...

5895
03:40:33,400 --> 03:40:34,260
People...

5896
03:40:34,260 --> 03:40:35,260
Are you serious?

5897
03:40:35,700 --> 03:40:37,120
Are you fucking...

5898
03:40:37,120 --> 03:40:37,920
Oh my god.

5899
03:40:38,280 --> 03:40:38,800
I...

5900
03:40:38,800 --> 03:40:39,300
I die.

5901
03:40:40,820 --> 03:40:41,700
There's no way.

5902
03:40:42,520 --> 03:40:44,040
I don't have a gun.

5903
03:40:46,580 --> 03:40:47,100
Unless...

5904
03:40:47,100 --> 03:40:47,940
Gun time.

5905
03:40:49,380 --> 03:40:50,500
I got a gun now.

5906
03:40:55,640 --> 03:40:56,060
Okay.

5907
03:40:56,240 --> 03:40:56,620
Nice.

5908
03:40:56,680 --> 03:40:57,060
We got it.

5909
03:40:57,860 --> 03:40:58,720
Oh, thank god.

5910
03:40:59,620 --> 03:41:00,580
What the fuck?

5911
03:41:00,820 --> 03:41:01,540
Oh my god.

5912
03:41:01,640 --> 03:41:02,400
We won the fight.

5913
03:41:02,860 --> 03:41:03,740
Oh my god.

5914
03:41:03,880 --> 03:41:04,360
We had...

5915
03:41:04,360 --> 03:41:04,980
We had the...

5916
03:41:04,980 --> 03:41:05,820
I'm so happy.

5917
03:41:07,880 --> 03:41:08,840
Oh my god.

5918
03:41:08,840 --> 03:41:10,440
We actually won the fight.

5919
03:41:11,000 --> 03:41:11,960
What the fuck?

5920
03:41:12,120 --> 03:41:12,420
I had...

5921
03:41:12,420 --> 03:41:13,520
My team had guns.

5922
03:41:13,720 --> 03:41:14,680
My team has hands!

5923
03:41:15,120 --> 03:41:15,600
Alright.

5924
03:41:15,720 --> 03:41:16,180
Locking in.

5925
03:41:19,380 --> 03:41:19,860
Okay.

5926
03:41:20,160 --> 03:41:20,720
Let's see.

5927
03:41:20,760 --> 03:41:21,820
I need actual guns.

5928
03:41:21,960 --> 03:41:22,900
I want to lock in.

5929
03:41:23,520 --> 03:41:23,920
Yay!

5930
03:41:23,920 --> 03:41:25,820
I love being a dev.

5931
03:41:30,820 --> 03:41:31,500
Yippee!

5932
03:41:33,260 --> 03:41:34,560
I love...

5933
03:41:35,280 --> 03:41:37,260
I love being a developer.

5934
03:41:37,960 --> 03:41:39,260
It's so fun.

5935
03:41:41,540 --> 03:41:43,300
That shouldn't be standing in the open.

5936
03:41:44,040 --> 03:41:44,720
But...

5937
03:41:44,720 --> 03:41:46,040
Yep, I fucking knew it.

5938
03:41:54,140 --> 03:41:54,820
Okay.

5939
03:41:55,140 --> 03:41:56,120
Good aim.

5940
03:41:59,860 --> 03:42:00,840
Good aim.

5941
03:42:05,360 --> 03:42:06,500
Need this.

5942
03:42:07,300 --> 03:42:07,720
Okay.

5943
03:42:07,960 --> 03:42:09,180
We help our guy.

5944
03:42:09,360 --> 03:42:09,920
Help our guy.

5945
03:42:10,540 --> 03:42:11,640
Coming over.

5946
03:42:15,990 --> 03:42:16,670
Fuck!

5947
03:42:29,990 --> 03:42:31,710
Okay, fine.

5948
03:42:35,550 --> 03:42:36,410
Fine.

5949
03:42:46,540 --> 03:42:47,900
That's unlucky.

5950
03:42:48,820 --> 03:42:51,040
Let me just sell real fast.

5951
03:42:55,100 --> 03:42:55,960
Alright.

5952
03:42:57,480 --> 03:42:58,880
Is this another team?

5953
03:42:58,980 --> 03:42:59,800
Is this another team?

5954
03:43:00,600 --> 03:43:02,200
Is this another team?

5955
03:43:05,040 --> 03:43:06,520
Is this another team?

5956
03:43:06,840 --> 03:43:07,840
God damn it!

5957
03:43:13,000 --> 03:43:14,180
Jesus Christ.

5958
03:43:16,180 --> 03:43:17,440
Oh my god.

5959
03:43:17,740 --> 03:43:19,220
Please, chill!

5960
03:43:22,800 --> 03:43:26,400
Oh my god!

5961
03:43:29,320 --> 03:43:32,760
I'm still playing too much for the team, but I think this is working, though.

5962
03:43:36,380 --> 03:43:39,360
I think we're playing for the team is alright right now.

5963
03:43:44,890 --> 03:43:46,270
Where is he?

5964
03:43:47,890 --> 03:43:48,970
Where is he?

5965
03:43:49,070 --> 03:43:49,890
Where is he?

5966
03:43:55,290 --> 03:43:59,670
This is... unfortunate, but...

5967
03:44:01,190 --> 03:44:02,470
Is that ours?

5968
03:44:02,730 --> 03:44:03,130
I don't care.

5969
03:44:09,100 --> 03:44:10,090
My god!

5970
03:44:10,670 --> 03:44:11,630
And there's more!

5971
03:44:12,450 --> 03:44:13,810
Oh my god.

5972
03:44:14,330 --> 03:44:14,450
Please.

5973
03:44:16,370 --> 03:44:17,270
I'm tired.

5974
03:44:17,270 --> 03:44:18,090
I'm tired.

5975
03:44:18,090 --> 03:44:19,130
Oh my god!

5976
03:44:21,510 --> 03:44:22,790
No!

5977
03:44:22,790 --> 03:44:23,530
I'm tired!

5978
03:44:25,750 --> 03:44:27,290
I'm tired!

5979
03:44:59,710 --> 03:45:02,510
I'm tired.

5980
03:45:03,430 --> 03:45:04,810
I'm tired.

5981
03:45:09,490 --> 03:45:10,970
I'm so tired.

5982
03:45:10,970 --> 03:45:12,090
They're dueled right now!

5983
03:45:12,210 --> 03:45:14,470
They're fucking dueled right now!

5984
03:45:17,810 --> 03:45:20,150
They're actually... I'm so tired.

5985
03:45:22,570 --> 03:45:24,830
I have eight more minutes.

5986
03:45:25,230 --> 03:45:26,790
They're dueled too!

5987
03:45:27,510 --> 03:45:29,790
For those who don't know, they're all pro players.

5988
03:45:30,130 --> 03:45:31,330
Apreeze used to be a pro player.

5989
03:45:31,930 --> 03:45:34,570
Deez used to be a pro... is currently a pro player.

5990
03:45:38,510 --> 03:45:40,350
I'm so tired.

5991
03:45:43,290 --> 03:45:45,030
This is just hell!

5992
03:45:51,490 --> 03:45:52,810
Oh my god.

5993
03:45:54,210 --> 03:45:55,330
Oh my god.

5994
03:45:55,950 --> 03:45:57,670
When will the nightmare end?

5995
03:45:57,990 --> 03:45:59,370
Can we rest?

5996
03:45:59,370 --> 03:46:00,170
I'm playing it.

5997
03:46:00,270 --> 03:46:02,190
I'm gonna play it so many other than Ballistic.

5998
03:46:02,190 --> 03:46:04,170
Oh my god.

5999
03:46:04,310 --> 03:46:06,330
I have to rest all the time.

6000
03:46:08,030 --> 03:46:09,630
Can we rest?

6001
03:46:10,450 --> 03:46:11,470
Are they three stacking?

6002
03:46:11,630 --> 03:46:13,130
I don't know who Wicked Archer is.

6003
03:46:13,590 --> 03:46:14,290
I don't know.

6004
03:46:19,030 --> 03:46:22,310
I'm so... I'm so tired.

6005
03:46:22,930 --> 03:46:25,050
It never stopped.

6006
03:46:25,050 --> 03:46:27,190
I never left.

6007
03:46:27,330 --> 03:46:31,750
We stayed there until there were six quads left.

6008
03:46:33,710 --> 03:46:34,670
That's crazy.

6009
03:46:35,250 --> 03:46:37,390
We were there until there were...

6010
03:46:37,390 --> 03:46:39,090
It never ended.

6011
03:46:42,550 --> 03:46:45,950
People just kept redeploying to us.

6012
03:46:46,110 --> 03:46:47,330
That was the worst part.

6013
03:46:49,130 --> 03:46:52,750
We just had people redeploying to us non-stop.

6014
03:46:57,550 --> 03:47:00,250
The EXPUD situation is...

6015
03:47:00,250 --> 03:47:01,090
You know what?

6016
03:47:01,210 --> 03:47:02,990
Maybe Arena was not a bad idea.

6017
03:47:03,470 --> 03:47:03,950
Maybe...

6018
03:47:08,310 --> 03:47:11,350
Maybe Arena was not a bad idea, guys.

6019
03:47:16,540 --> 03:47:17,660
No, it's okay.

6020
03:47:17,840 --> 03:47:18,600
We have...

6021
03:47:18,600 --> 03:47:19,800
Six more minutes.

6022
03:47:20,200 --> 03:47:20,900
And then...

6023
03:47:20,900 --> 03:47:23,180
If we get in a game in six more minutes, that's our last game.

6024
03:47:24,200 --> 03:47:26,760
Arena didn't have a bell curve.

6025
03:47:27,040 --> 03:47:28,140
It did not.

6026
03:47:30,460 --> 03:47:33,180
It did not have a bell curve.

6027
03:47:37,060 --> 03:47:37,900
I think...

6028
03:47:37,900 --> 03:47:41,080
I think if I was duode or three stacking, I would be fine.

6029
03:47:41,280 --> 03:47:42,240
I would be fine.

6030
03:47:43,040 --> 03:47:45,040
The bell curve is, like, fucking me up.

6031
03:47:46,780 --> 03:47:48,380
The bell curve hurts, man.

6032
03:47:48,620 --> 03:47:50,260
The bell curve really hurts.

6033
03:47:50,740 --> 03:47:51,260
Cause I just...

6034
03:47:52,280 --> 03:47:52,900
When would I...

6035
03:47:52,900 --> 03:47:55,680
The last time I got pro on my team was Peeps.

6036
03:47:55,880 --> 03:47:58,140
And, like, he's an MC now.

6037
03:47:58,860 --> 03:47:59,340
Like...

6038
03:48:05,640 --> 03:48:09,140
I don't know anybody that is not in the stack right now.

6039
03:48:09,540 --> 03:48:10,350
That is...

6040
03:48:11,300 --> 03:48:11,840
Um...

6041
03:48:11,840 --> 03:48:12,600
Maybe I'll do Cat.

6042
03:48:12,660 --> 03:48:13,080
I don't know.

6043
03:48:15,060 --> 03:48:15,600
Uh...

6044
03:48:15,600 --> 03:48:16,000
Fuck.

6045
03:48:16,000 --> 03:48:17,480
I'll try Ballistic when we're into...

6046
03:48:17,480 --> 03:48:18,720
My last game on Ballistic.

6047
03:48:19,460 --> 03:48:20,420
Because, like...

6048
03:48:20,420 --> 03:48:22,020
I don't know people that...

6049
03:48:22,020 --> 03:48:24,280
Who has early access that's, um...

6050
03:48:24,940 --> 03:48:26,880
That's not already stacked up.

6051
03:48:27,000 --> 03:48:28,000
Or, like...

6052
03:48:28,000 --> 03:48:29,660
They don't have early access.

6053
03:48:29,660 --> 03:48:30,680
The players I know.

6054
03:48:35,640 --> 03:48:37,300
I was just very tired.

6055
03:48:37,740 --> 03:48:38,540
Oh, man.

6056
03:48:41,740 --> 03:48:43,520
I was a third party.

6057
03:48:44,500 --> 03:48:45,640
I thought it would stop.

6058
03:48:45,660 --> 03:48:46,860
But it never stopped.

6059
03:48:49,580 --> 03:48:51,300
I thought it would stop!

6060
03:48:51,820 --> 03:48:59,480
But they just kept coming, and they just kept coming, and they just kept coming, and they just kept coming...

6061
03:49:03,940 --> 03:49:05,680
It never stops.

6062
03:49:13,180 --> 03:49:14,580
Alright down I go,

6063
03:49:17,880 --> 03:49:19,960
I don't have hope anymore.

6064
03:49:22,920 --> 03:49:24,420
Don't say that.

6065
03:49:24,620 --> 03:49:26,720
Now I don't believe anymore.

6066
03:49:27,060 --> 03:49:29,120
This is my last game.

6067
03:49:31,460 --> 03:49:33,120
Oh, no!

6068
03:49:34,860 --> 03:49:35,540
No!

6069
03:49:36,060 --> 03:49:36,500
What?

6070
03:49:36,860 --> 03:49:37,240
Sully!

6071
03:49:37,900 --> 03:49:39,220
God damn it.

6072
03:49:39,580 --> 03:49:42,460
Okay, if I die, die now so I can re-queue.

6073
03:49:42,780 --> 03:49:44,340
Please, die now.

6074
03:49:44,420 --> 03:49:45,820
Oh my god, it's Sully.

6075
03:49:46,340 --> 03:49:47,760
God damn it, Sully.

6076
03:49:47,760 --> 03:49:49,040
No, it's not.

6077
03:49:49,140 --> 03:49:50,120
Sully's not a controller.

6078
03:49:50,560 --> 03:49:51,880
Wait, who's this fake Sully?

6079
03:49:53,680 --> 03:49:56,020
I swear to God, if you die now, I can re-queue.

6080
03:49:56,520 --> 03:49:57,700
No, that is Sully.

6081
03:50:04,290 --> 03:50:05,510
Oh my god.

6082
03:50:05,810 --> 03:50:06,650
Is this actual?

6083
03:50:06,830 --> 03:50:07,890
No, please, just die now.

6084
03:50:08,090 --> 03:50:10,950
Please, you know it closes in four minutes.

6085
03:50:11,290 --> 03:50:13,150
You know it closes in four minutes!

6086
03:50:13,310 --> 03:50:14,350
I need my game!

6087
03:50:18,010 --> 03:50:19,070
Oh, please.

6088
03:50:19,470 --> 03:50:20,330
No, do not.

6089
03:50:20,490 --> 03:50:21,570
Do not do this to me.

6090
03:50:21,910 --> 03:50:23,450
I'm... I do not.

6091
03:50:25,070 --> 03:50:25,870
Do not.

6092
03:50:26,830 --> 03:50:28,030
Do not do this.

6093
03:50:28,270 --> 03:50:28,810
Oh my god.

6094
03:50:28,950 --> 03:50:29,690
Do not do this to me.

6095
03:50:29,750 --> 03:50:30,490
I swear to God.

6096
03:50:30,490 --> 03:50:31,730
Do I risk it?

6097
03:50:32,230 --> 03:50:32,910
Do I risk it?

6098
03:50:33,070 --> 03:50:33,530
Do I...

6099
03:50:34,070 --> 03:50:35,430
Do I risk it?

6100
03:50:35,950 --> 03:50:37,650
I have two minutes to get a game.

6101
03:50:37,850 --> 03:50:38,450
Do I risk it?

6102
03:50:38,530 --> 03:50:39,730
Or do I wait for her to rest?

6103
03:50:42,710 --> 03:50:43,150
Yes?

6104
03:50:43,370 --> 03:50:44,350
Okay, I'm risking it.

6105
03:50:45,690 --> 03:50:46,130
Okay.

6106
03:50:46,130 --> 03:50:46,950
No, Sully.

6107
03:50:47,110 --> 03:50:48,190
Yeah, Sully plays Apex.

6108
03:50:48,190 --> 03:50:49,190
That's what I was like.

6109
03:50:49,270 --> 03:50:49,970
Is that... Oh my god.

6110
03:50:50,150 --> 03:50:50,250
Look.

6111
03:50:50,630 --> 03:50:51,270
One minute.

6112
03:50:51,470 --> 03:50:52,150
I swear to God.

6113
03:50:52,150 --> 03:50:53,410
I risked it, guys.

6114
03:50:53,650 --> 03:50:54,430
I risked it.

6115
03:50:54,730 --> 03:50:55,750
This one minute.

6116
03:50:55,890 --> 03:50:57,390
I better get that game, guys.

6117
03:50:57,410 --> 03:50:58,270
I swear to God.

6118
03:50:58,430 --> 03:51:02,270
I have one minute and 23... 20... Oh my god.

6119
03:51:02,450 --> 03:51:03,670
I swear to God.

6120
03:51:04,970 --> 03:51:05,450
Please.

6121
03:51:05,910 --> 03:51:08,130
One minute and 16 seconds.

6122
03:51:10,430 --> 03:51:10,910
Wait.

6123
03:51:12,530 --> 03:51:14,030
Is that actually him?

6124
03:51:14,290 --> 03:51:15,630
He used to play Apex.

6125
03:51:15,850 --> 03:51:16,510
That's what I was like.

6126
03:51:16,650 --> 03:51:17,150
Is that him?

6127
03:51:21,940 --> 03:51:22,940
I'm pretty sure.

6128
03:51:23,160 --> 03:51:24,320
I'm pretty sure that's him.

6129
03:51:24,480 --> 03:51:25,460
He's still... Yeah.

6130
03:51:26,880 --> 03:51:29,980
I think Sully is... I think that was actual Sully.

6131
03:51:36,460 --> 03:51:37,480
I'm pretty sure.

6132
03:51:37,620 --> 03:51:39,700
I'm like... Yeah, I'm pretty sure that was.

6133
03:51:39,820 --> 03:51:39,980
Yeah.

6134
03:51:41,380 --> 03:51:42,040
Oh my god.

6135
03:51:42,060 --> 03:51:43,320
This countdown is so stressful.

6136
03:51:43,740 --> 03:51:45,400
This countdown is actually so stressful.

6137
03:51:45,660 --> 03:51:50,920
I need like... In 35 seconds, I need like 12 more people to join the queue.

6138
03:51:50,920 --> 03:51:56,900
I... I need... I need... Come on.

6139
03:51:59,500 --> 03:52:00,780
Oh my god.

6140
03:52:00,780 --> 03:52:04,780
This countdown is like... I feel like I'm... I'm gonna burst.

6141
03:52:04,780 --> 03:52:13,880
17... 16... 15... 14... 13... 12... 11... 10...

6142
03:52:13,880 --> 03:52:14,420
Oh my god.

6143
03:52:14,660 --> 03:52:15,540
8 players.

6144
03:52:15,760 --> 03:52:16,000
Please.

6145
03:52:16,460 --> 03:52:19,380
8 people die right now.

6146
03:52:19,700 --> 03:52:20,140
No!

6147
03:52:25,760 --> 03:52:26,230
No.

6148
03:52:26,770 --> 03:52:27,350
No.

6149
03:52:27,670 --> 03:52:28,610
They can't do this.

6150
03:52:28,970 --> 03:52:29,450
No.

6151
03:52:34,710 --> 03:52:36,030
There's no way.

6152
03:52:36,350 --> 03:52:36,810
Come on.

6153
03:52:37,210 --> 03:52:38,310
Let us in.

6154
03:52:38,750 --> 03:52:39,610
Come on.

6155
03:52:40,130 --> 03:52:41,790
You can't close it down yet.

6156
03:52:42,570 --> 03:52:42,910
No.

6157
03:52:43,530 --> 03:52:45,010
Don't close it down yet.

6158
03:52:45,410 --> 03:52:45,810
No.

6159
03:52:49,670 --> 03:52:50,870
They did.

6160
03:52:52,070 --> 03:52:53,010
Oh man.

6161
03:52:53,550 --> 03:52:54,030
Oh wait.

6162
03:52:54,370 --> 03:52:54,590
Wait.

6163
03:52:54,790 --> 03:52:55,490
Wait a minute.

6164
03:52:56,590 --> 03:52:57,670
Wait a minute.

6165
03:52:58,930 --> 03:53:00,090
There's hope.

6166
03:53:01,030 --> 03:53:02,470
There's... Wait a minute.

6167
03:53:03,410 --> 03:53:04,070
No.

6168
03:53:04,310 --> 03:53:05,250
People are leaving.

6169
03:53:05,810 --> 03:53:07,330
There's no more hope.

6170
03:53:07,330 --> 03:53:07,430
No.

6171
03:53:07,610 --> 03:53:09,850
It can't end like this.

6172
03:53:11,990 --> 03:53:13,970
I can't... Oh man.

6173
03:53:14,130 --> 03:53:17,230
That was the riskiest 50-50 we've ever had.

6174
03:53:19,810 --> 03:53:21,050
No hope.

6175
03:53:21,610 --> 03:53:22,470
Only cope.

6176
03:53:23,010 --> 03:53:26,230
That was a risky 50-50 but... Oh wait.

6177
03:53:26,410 --> 03:53:27,370
People can still join.

6178
03:53:27,670 --> 03:53:28,450
Wait a minute.

6179
03:53:29,050 --> 03:53:30,710
They haven't shut it down.

6180
03:53:31,470 --> 03:53:31,770
Wait.

6181
03:53:32,770 --> 03:53:34,010
There's still hope.

6182
03:53:34,630 --> 03:53:35,090
Come on.

6183
03:53:35,290 --> 03:53:35,970
Nine more.

6184
03:53:36,390 --> 03:53:36,970
Come on.

6185
03:53:37,790 --> 03:53:39,050
We just need...

6186
03:53:39,410 --> 03:53:40,390
Nine more.

6187
03:53:42,270 --> 03:53:43,910
It's not over.

6188
03:53:45,570 --> 03:53:47,430
Use my death count.

6189
03:53:48,490 --> 03:53:49,210
I'll wait.

6190
03:53:49,430 --> 03:53:50,170
I'll wait.

6191
03:53:50,450 --> 03:53:51,690
Three minutes.

6192
03:53:52,290 --> 03:53:55,150
But in three minutes, this doesn't go above 51.

6193
03:53:57,510 --> 03:53:58,830
It might be over.

6194
03:53:59,310 --> 03:53:59,990
Guys.

6195
03:54:00,790 --> 03:54:02,070
If in three minutes...

6196
03:54:03,570 --> 03:54:04,950
It doesn't go...

6197
03:54:04,950 --> 03:54:05,110
Wait.

6198
03:54:05,550 --> 03:54:06,590
It went to 52.

6199
03:54:08,290 --> 03:54:08,890
Unless...

6200
03:54:08,890 --> 03:54:10,610
But this has been so long though.

6201
03:54:10,930 --> 03:54:12,170
I don't know guys.

6202
03:54:12,530 --> 03:54:13,730
I don't know.

6203
03:54:14,650 --> 03:54:16,130
I don't know guys.

6204
03:54:18,850 --> 03:54:19,450
Guys.

6205
03:54:19,650 --> 03:54:20,110
I don't know.

6206
03:54:20,370 --> 03:54:21,210
How are...

6207
03:54:22,190 --> 03:54:23,610
What is my luck?

6208
03:54:24,050 --> 03:54:24,510
Are they...

6209
03:54:24,510 --> 03:54:25,090
I'm gonna check.

6210
03:54:25,230 --> 03:54:26,890
I need to check these players if they're stacking.

6211
03:54:27,710 --> 03:54:28,830
I had...

6212
03:54:28,830 --> 03:54:33,350
The only person I recognized in my team during Battle Royale was Peeps.

6213
03:54:33,790 --> 03:54:38,890
But like, I'm opening up some of the other Apex streamers and they're like literally with like...

6214
03:54:40,510 --> 03:54:41,710
They're stacked...

6215
03:54:41,710 --> 03:54:42,770
They have to be stacking.

6216
03:54:42,910 --> 03:54:46,510
There's no fucking way I was that unlucky in my lobbies.

6217
03:54:46,510 --> 03:54:50,490
I see like one of them with like two other Pred players.

6218
03:54:50,810 --> 03:54:53,010
Like consistent Pred players and pros.

6219
03:54:53,210 --> 03:54:53,680
I'm like...

6220
03:54:54,390 --> 03:54:54,930
How?

6221
03:55:01,810 --> 03:55:02,590
How?

6222
03:55:02,790 --> 03:55:02,850
How?

6223
03:55:02,850 --> 03:55:04,290
I got DJ Sneaky Snake.

6224
03:55:04,590 --> 03:55:05,250
I...

6225
03:55:06,350 --> 03:55:07,310
I got...

6226
03:55:07,310 --> 03:55:08,250
I got fucking...

6227
03:55:08,250 --> 03:55:09,970
DJ Sneaky Snake.

6228
03:55:09,970 --> 03:55:10,130
DJ Sneaky Snake.

6229
03:55:10,630 --> 03:55:11,330
And the...

6230
03:55:11,330 --> 03:55:15,130
Lulu Sushi and ORAX on the same team?

6231
03:55:15,590 --> 03:55:16,130
How?

6232
03:55:16,350 --> 03:55:18,410
How did you beat the bell curve?

6233
03:55:19,130 --> 03:55:21,690
How did you...

6234
03:55:22,690 --> 03:55:26,290
Do not diss DJ Sneaky Snake.

6235
03:55:26,590 --> 03:55:28,350
He was number one.

6236
03:55:29,290 --> 03:55:31,310
Do not diss him.

6237
03:55:33,650 --> 03:55:36,030
There's no way I refuse to believe.

6238
03:55:38,270 --> 03:55:39,530
Wait.

6239
03:55:39,530 --> 03:55:40,290
57.

6240
03:55:40,650 --> 03:55:41,510
Wait.

6241
03:55:42,190 --> 03:55:42,390
57.

6242
03:55:42,390 --> 03:55:43,550
Oh my god.

6243
03:55:44,870 --> 03:55:46,830
It's possible.

6244
03:55:48,390 --> 03:55:50,330
Oh my god.

6245
03:55:52,010 --> 03:55:53,070
Wait.

6246
03:55:54,550 --> 03:55:55,430
No.

6247
03:55:55,570 --> 03:55:58,110
They actually cued into each other.

6248
03:55:59,970 --> 03:56:01,230
That's...

6249
03:56:02,490 --> 03:56:05,970
I may or may not be very jealous that...

6250
03:56:05,970 --> 03:56:07,350
For some reason.

6251
03:56:07,670 --> 03:56:08,010
Lulu.

6252
03:56:08,510 --> 03:56:09,010
ORAX.

6253
03:56:09,990 --> 03:56:10,590
And...

6254
03:56:10,590 --> 03:56:10,970
Um...

6255
03:56:11,710 --> 03:56:12,670
They still lost though.

6256
03:56:12,770 --> 03:56:13,410
They lost the fight.

6257
03:56:13,570 --> 03:56:14,170
But like...

6258
03:56:14,170 --> 03:56:14,970
It was Lulu.

6259
03:56:15,170 --> 03:56:15,630
ORAX.

6260
03:56:15,750 --> 03:56:16,310
And...

6261
03:56:16,310 --> 03:56:17,390
Who did I say what third was?

6262
03:56:17,490 --> 03:56:18,490
I forgot the third.

6263
03:56:19,150 --> 03:56:21,630
They actually randomly got together.

6264
03:56:22,170 --> 03:56:23,610
On the same team.

6265
03:56:25,130 --> 03:56:25,730
God.

6266
03:56:25,730 --> 03:56:26,710
I wish that was me.

6267
03:56:27,970 --> 03:56:29,290
There's no way.

6268
03:56:29,290 --> 03:56:30,990
That was a natural Q.

6269
03:56:32,850 --> 03:56:33,870
Oh my god.

6270
03:56:33,870 --> 03:56:36,070
I got LG Kareem Cheese.

6271
03:56:38,570 --> 03:56:38,970
I...

6272
03:56:39,490 --> 03:56:40,650
Every time I got it.

6273
03:56:40,710 --> 03:56:42,110
I get a real player?

6274
03:56:42,510 --> 03:56:42,690
No.

6275
03:56:44,250 --> 03:56:44,630
Okay.

6276
03:56:44,750 --> 03:56:45,070
Thank god.

6277
03:56:45,230 --> 03:56:45,370
Okay.

6278
03:56:45,490 --> 03:56:45,930
I was gonna say.

6279
03:56:46,090 --> 03:56:47,990
I know LG Kareem Cheese is a real player.

6280
03:56:48,110 --> 03:56:49,310
I know he's a real player.

6281
03:56:49,610 --> 03:56:50,930
I'm up the bell curve again.

6282
03:56:51,110 --> 03:56:52,450
I know he's a real player too.

6283
03:56:52,690 --> 03:56:54,130
I was gonna freak out.

6284
03:56:54,130 --> 03:56:54,710
But...

6285
03:56:56,170 --> 03:56:57,470
I was kidding.

6286
03:56:57,890 --> 03:57:00,250
I was not gonna be happy.

6287
03:57:02,030 --> 03:57:03,410
I'm gonna callous again.

6288
03:57:03,690 --> 03:57:03,950
Fuck it.

6289
03:57:04,110 --> 03:57:04,230
Oh.

6290
03:57:04,410 --> 03:57:04,830
Nevermind.

6291
03:57:10,270 --> 03:57:11,070
Nevermind.

6292
03:57:11,850 --> 03:57:13,650
I'm surfing that curve.

6293
03:57:21,140 --> 03:57:22,160
I'm surfing it.

6294
03:57:25,200 --> 03:57:25,600
Yeah.

6295
03:57:26,740 --> 03:57:27,720
I'm a dev.

6296
03:57:31,920 --> 03:57:32,520
Yippee.

6297
03:57:38,680 --> 03:57:39,280
Alright.

6298
03:57:39,880 --> 03:57:40,640
That's nice.

6299
03:57:40,780 --> 03:57:41,680
I made it past.

6300
03:57:42,160 --> 03:57:43,320
I made it past.

6301
03:57:44,280 --> 03:57:45,220
The curse.

6302
03:57:46,680 --> 03:57:48,780
He decided to give us one more.

6303
03:57:48,960 --> 03:57:49,820
One more.

6304
03:57:52,340 --> 03:57:56,040
I don't know who Misery Plague is, but I know this person's a real person.

6305
03:57:59,280 --> 03:58:00,060
Dropping in.

6306
03:58:00,100 --> 03:58:00,180
Hang on.

6307
03:58:00,180 --> 03:58:01,420
My dev powers work.

6308
03:58:01,580 --> 03:58:01,720
Guys.

6309
03:58:01,880 --> 03:58:02,240
Oh my god.

6310
03:58:02,360 --> 03:58:03,180
There's Pred Trails too.

6311
03:58:03,320 --> 03:58:04,300
I could have equipped my parents.

6312
03:58:04,680 --> 03:58:07,000
I could have equipped the Pred Trails.

6313
03:58:07,520 --> 03:58:08,120
I could have equipped the Pred Trails.

6314
03:58:09,880 --> 03:58:10,920
Oh my god.

6315
03:58:13,360 --> 03:58:15,100
I could have equipped one.

6316
03:58:17,060 --> 03:58:19,000
What if server stopped right now?

6317
03:58:19,160 --> 03:58:21,320
Then life is a cruel fucking joke.

6318
03:58:21,760 --> 03:58:23,340
And I'm living it.

6319
03:58:28,660 --> 03:58:31,300
Oh my Karim Cheese is down.

6320
03:58:31,680 --> 03:58:33,060
They cannot do this to me.

6321
03:58:33,540 --> 03:58:34,180
Karim Cheese.

6322
03:58:34,500 --> 03:58:36,660
Why did you take me to Sully?

6323
03:58:36,920 --> 03:58:37,500
Oh my god.

6324
03:58:37,740 --> 03:58:38,700
There's no way.

6325
03:58:41,780 --> 03:58:44,040
I got taken to hell again.

6326
03:58:44,840 --> 03:58:45,240
I...

6327
03:58:45,240 --> 03:58:46,920
Karim Cheese does...

6328
03:58:48,740 --> 03:58:50,100
I can't...

6329
03:58:50,100 --> 03:58:51,100
Like what...

6330
03:58:51,100 --> 03:58:52,780
What do I do?

6331
03:58:53,360 --> 03:58:54,960
I did this situation.

6332
03:58:57,720 --> 03:59:00,500
They give him just to give me pain.

6333
03:59:01,160 --> 03:59:01,840
I...

6334
03:59:03,720 --> 03:59:05,300
At least he dies.

6335
03:59:05,580 --> 03:59:05,780
You know.

6336
03:59:06,160 --> 03:59:06,780
At least...

6337
03:59:06,780 --> 03:59:08,320
At least they die too.

6338
03:59:08,960 --> 03:59:09,080
Oh.

6339
03:59:10,040 --> 03:59:12,080
His life is just unfair.

6340
03:59:12,600 --> 03:59:13,820
At least...

6341
03:59:13,820 --> 03:59:14,260
I...

6342
03:59:14,260 --> 03:59:16,860
At least they die too for that.

6343
03:59:17,560 --> 03:59:18,120
I...

6344
03:59:19,300 --> 03:59:21,140
Hope to punish you.

6345
03:59:21,400 --> 03:59:21,780
Wait.

6346
03:59:21,880 --> 03:59:22,860
There's still hope.

6347
03:59:23,120 --> 03:59:23,340
Guys.

6348
03:59:23,340 --> 03:59:26,920
They haven't shut down the servers just yet.

6349
03:59:28,960 --> 03:59:31,340
They haven't done it guys.

6350
03:59:31,900 --> 03:59:33,000
They're still...

6351
03:59:33,000 --> 03:59:35,600
They forgot to close the servers yet.

6352
03:59:36,880 --> 03:59:37,840
They...

6353
03:59:40,140 --> 03:59:40,620
Guys.

6354
03:59:40,620 --> 03:59:41,840
They haven't.

6355
03:59:43,080 --> 03:59:44,700
They haven't closed it.

6356
03:59:45,500 --> 03:59:47,120
There's still hope.

6357
03:59:48,300 --> 03:59:48,780
Wait.

6358
03:59:48,780 --> 03:59:50,920
There's actually a non-Korean Selly?

6359
03:59:53,500 --> 03:59:54,500
Oh my god.

6360
03:59:54,700 --> 03:59:55,560
There's a...

6361
03:59:56,440 --> 03:59:57,720
There's another...

6362
03:59:57,720 --> 04:00:01,340
There's a French competitive player?

6363
04:00:02,700 --> 04:00:04,520
There's a French pro player.

6364
04:00:04,780 --> 04:00:06,700
That's also called Selly.

6365
04:00:12,250 --> 04:00:14,750
There's two Apex Selly's?

6366
04:00:15,410 --> 04:00:15,890
Yeah.

6367
04:00:16,030 --> 04:00:17,850
There's a French Apex pro.

6368
04:00:18,450 --> 04:00:19,510
Former pro.

6369
04:00:19,850 --> 04:00:21,690
That's also named Selly.

6370
04:00:22,190 --> 04:00:23,730
So I was like...

6371
04:00:23,730 --> 04:00:24,130
Yeah.

6372
04:00:24,310 --> 04:00:24,990
I was like...

6373
04:00:24,990 --> 04:00:25,230
Wait.

6374
04:00:25,390 --> 04:00:26,650
There's two Selly's?

6375
04:00:26,950 --> 04:00:27,630
There's...

6376
04:00:29,330 --> 04:00:31,150
What is this Selly first?

6377
04:00:31,490 --> 04:00:32,170
No.

6378
04:00:32,270 --> 04:00:32,550
It's okay.

6379
04:00:32,650 --> 04:00:33,510
They're still on queue.

6380
04:00:33,850 --> 04:00:35,770
They forgot to shut it down, guys.

6381
04:00:39,050 --> 04:00:41,050
They forgot to shut it down.

6382
04:00:41,450 --> 04:00:42,930
They forgot to shut it down.

6383
04:00:44,830 --> 04:00:45,390
Nice.

6384
04:00:48,830 --> 04:00:50,990
I'm looking at the chat just to make sure.

6385
04:00:51,610 --> 04:00:54,230
I need like one good game, guys.

6386
04:00:54,610 --> 04:00:56,290
Just one good game.

6387
04:01:01,860 --> 04:01:02,500
Like...

6388
04:01:02,500 --> 04:01:06,080
I've been taken to hell every game, I feel like.

6389
04:01:06,880 --> 04:01:07,520
I...

6390
04:01:07,520 --> 04:01:13,140
Every game, my team took me to hell and then I never came back.

6391
04:01:15,720 --> 04:01:16,360
My...

6392
04:01:16,360 --> 04:01:16,880
The...

6393
04:01:16,880 --> 04:01:19,860
The funny part is that my good games were...

6394
04:01:21,460 --> 04:01:22,200
Um...

6395
04:01:22,200 --> 04:01:24,300
My good games were...

6396
04:01:25,080 --> 04:01:25,820
Mostly...

6397
04:01:26,770 --> 04:01:27,140
Arenas.

6398
04:01:27,680 --> 04:01:28,680
And I don't...

6399
04:01:28,680 --> 04:01:29,840
I don't like that.

6400
04:01:31,570 --> 04:01:33,080
What is that no...

6401
04:01:50,580 --> 04:01:50,880
Bro!

6402
04:01:54,940 --> 04:01:55,680
That's...

6403
04:01:56,070 --> 04:01:56,440
Guys...

6404
04:01:56,440 --> 04:01:57,500
Maybe it wasn't me.

6405
04:01:57,640 --> 04:01:59,180
Maybe it was the bow check.

6406
04:01:59,180 --> 04:01:59,240
Okay.

6407
04:02:00,140 --> 04:02:02,820
That was four no-regs.

6408
04:02:03,940 --> 04:02:05,200
In a row.

6409
04:02:05,900 --> 04:02:07,520
Oh, now he hits it.

6410
04:02:07,620 --> 04:02:08,200
There you go.

6411
04:02:08,460 --> 04:02:08,740
There you go.

6412
04:02:08,820 --> 04:02:09,480
Now it's back.

6413
04:02:09,700 --> 04:02:11,160
But that's crazy.

6414
04:02:15,420 --> 04:02:16,380
That's actually...

6415
04:02:18,000 --> 04:02:19,280
That's actually...

6416
04:02:19,280 --> 04:02:20,300
So fucked.

6417
04:02:22,620 --> 04:02:25,440
He hit four fucking no-regs.

6418
04:02:25,540 --> 04:02:26,540
On a bow check.

6419
04:02:27,020 --> 04:02:28,820
That was literally a kill right there.

6420
04:02:28,820 --> 04:02:29,700
If he hit it.

6421
04:02:30,920 --> 04:02:32,780
Why don't they just shoot the tracker?

6422
04:02:33,540 --> 04:02:34,980
It's not that hard.

6423
04:02:38,950 --> 04:02:39,510
Alright.

6424
04:02:39,850 --> 04:02:40,330
That hit.

6425
04:02:40,810 --> 04:02:41,830
At least that hits.

6426
04:02:42,750 --> 04:02:43,610
See on a...

6427
04:02:43,610 --> 04:02:44,590
Can you answer it too?

6428
04:02:44,930 --> 04:02:45,450
Okay.

6429
04:02:45,510 --> 04:02:46,190
Now it hits.

6430
04:02:49,600 --> 04:02:51,240
At least now it hits, guys.

6431
04:02:52,100 --> 04:02:52,560
Yippee!

6432
04:02:54,720 --> 04:02:56,160
I hate the car though.

6433
04:02:57,140 --> 04:02:58,100
Yeah, I'd be so mad.

6434
04:02:58,220 --> 04:03:00,080
No, I'd be very mad.

6435
04:03:03,160 --> 04:03:05,780
That was actually an insane no-regs too.

6436
04:03:06,160 --> 04:03:07,620
Cause it was like point blank.

6437
04:03:08,060 --> 04:03:08,620
It's...

6438
04:03:08,620 --> 04:03:12,480
Usually it makes more sense if the no-reg was like really far away.

6439
04:03:12,840 --> 04:03:14,180
But it was actually...

6440
04:03:14,180 --> 04:03:15,740
It was like point blank too.

6441
04:03:16,060 --> 04:03:17,260
So the fact that he...

6442
04:03:17,260 --> 04:03:18,420
Missed those shots...

6443
04:03:19,080 --> 04:03:20,660
With that was...

6444
04:03:20,660 --> 04:03:21,100
Insane.

6445
04:03:22,340 --> 04:03:26,640
I would have left the game after four no-regs.

6446
04:03:26,740 --> 04:03:27,580
Poor guy.

6447
04:03:30,240 --> 04:03:30,820
Yeah.

6448
04:03:31,060 --> 04:03:31,740
Four in a row.

6449
04:03:32,180 --> 04:03:33,540
Is actually like...

6450
04:03:33,540 --> 04:03:34,390
Insane to have...

6451
04:03:34,720 --> 04:03:35,160
Happen.

6452
04:03:36,160 --> 04:03:36,940
I'm looking.

6453
04:03:37,120 --> 04:03:37,940
I'm looking guys.

6454
04:03:38,120 --> 04:03:40,020
I'm looking if they shut down the server or not.

6455
04:03:40,020 --> 04:03:41,160
I'm making sure.

6456
04:03:41,320 --> 04:03:41,900
Don't worry.

6457
04:03:43,560 --> 04:03:45,640
I'm not here to be in purgatory.

6458
04:03:46,100 --> 04:03:47,660
I'm just making sure the server...

6459
04:03:47,660 --> 04:03:48,320
It is.

6460
04:03:48,460 --> 04:03:49,120
Don't worry.

6461
04:03:49,600 --> 04:03:50,520
The server...

6462
04:03:50,520 --> 04:03:52,880
May or may not still be around.

6463
04:03:54,680 --> 04:03:54,980
Maybe.

6464
04:03:55,660 --> 04:03:56,260
Because...

6465
04:03:56,260 --> 04:03:58,080
If Fade is still queuing...

6466
04:03:58,080 --> 04:03:58,800
Then it...

6467
04:03:58,800 --> 04:03:59,960
We're still in it, baby.

6468
04:04:00,100 --> 04:04:01,360
We're still in it.

6469
04:04:03,200 --> 04:04:06,020
I'll only stop when Fade stops.

6470
04:04:09,200 --> 04:04:11,760
If he stops, I stop.

6471
04:04:14,420 --> 04:04:15,380
It's okay.

6472
04:04:15,600 --> 04:04:16,060
Plus...

6473
04:04:16,060 --> 04:04:16,420
Don't worry.

6474
04:04:16,920 --> 04:04:18,700
That really clears it up.

6475
04:04:20,120 --> 04:04:20,720
No.

6476
04:04:20,840 --> 04:04:21,300
I'm tired.

6477
04:04:21,480 --> 04:04:23,900
I'm actually running by pure adrenaline right now.

6478
04:04:26,040 --> 04:04:27,600
I'm running on...

6479
04:04:27,600 --> 04:04:28,660
Pure fucking adrenaline.

6480
04:04:30,100 --> 04:04:31,480
Was that no-rig earlier?

6481
04:04:31,640 --> 04:04:32,400
From the first hit?

6482
04:04:33,780 --> 04:04:34,600
But we'll see.

6483
04:04:39,750 --> 04:04:41,310
What if he stops cute?

6484
04:04:41,550 --> 04:04:42,330
Then it's over.

6485
04:04:43,430 --> 04:04:44,470
Then it's over.

6486
04:04:46,150 --> 04:04:47,590
There's no coming back.

6487
04:04:50,770 --> 04:04:51,530
I don't know.

6488
04:04:52,050 --> 04:04:53,590
I'll try Catalyst next round.

6489
04:04:56,430 --> 04:04:56,890
Nice.

6490
04:04:58,570 --> 04:04:59,450
Good shot.

6491
04:05:01,990 --> 04:05:02,450
Alright.

6492
04:05:02,670 --> 04:05:03,790
Next game is gonna be it.

6493
04:05:04,170 --> 04:05:05,230
I feel it.

6494
04:05:07,430 --> 04:05:09,090
I feel the next game.

6495
04:05:09,210 --> 04:05:10,010
Oh, that was a good...

6496
04:05:10,010 --> 04:05:10,570
Oh, never mind.

6497
04:05:10,810 --> 04:05:11,290
I was gonna say...

6498
04:05:11,290 --> 04:05:12,770
That was a piece in tap strafe.

6499
04:05:14,870 --> 04:05:15,770
That was a pretty...

6500
04:05:15,770 --> 04:05:16,390
Oh, it's Lulu.

6501
04:05:17,590 --> 04:05:17,890
Tap...

6502
04:05:18,610 --> 04:05:19,390
Doesn't matter.

6503
04:05:19,590 --> 04:05:21,010
He tapped strafe in front of a...

6504
04:05:21,010 --> 04:05:23,430
In front of a mouse and keyboard player.

6505
04:05:25,550 --> 04:05:26,430
Rest in peace.

6506
04:05:27,870 --> 04:05:29,510
That was an M and K player.

6507
04:05:37,430 --> 04:05:38,330
This is it.

6508
04:05:38,510 --> 04:05:39,850
This next game...

6509
04:05:40,470 --> 04:05:40,850
No.

6510
04:05:42,150 --> 04:05:42,670
No.

6511
04:05:45,210 --> 04:05:45,910
Oh, no.

6512
04:05:46,090 --> 04:05:46,690
Okay, that's fine.

6513
04:05:46,870 --> 04:05:47,330
It's fine.

6514
04:05:50,680 --> 04:05:51,440
It's okay.

6515
04:05:52,040 --> 04:05:52,920
It's fine.

6516
04:06:01,350 --> 04:06:02,870
There's still people queuing.

6517
04:06:02,950 --> 04:06:04,270
He's still queuing.

6518
04:06:06,370 --> 04:06:06,830
He's...

6519
04:06:08,830 --> 04:06:10,450
Fade is still queuing.

6520
04:06:11,010 --> 04:06:11,910
Fade is still queuing.

6521
04:06:14,650 --> 04:06:15,110
No.

6522
04:06:15,370 --> 04:06:15,450
Oh, wait.

6523
04:06:15,510 --> 04:06:15,850
Was that...

6524
04:06:15,850 --> 04:06:16,490
No, you can...

6525
04:06:16,490 --> 04:06:18,310
I'm pretty sure you can tap straight with the ability.

6526
04:06:18,710 --> 04:06:19,710
Because it's a jump.

6527
04:06:20,350 --> 04:06:21,490
Because he, like...

6528
04:06:21,490 --> 04:06:21,970
He, like...

6529
04:06:21,970 --> 04:06:22,470
He, like, did a...

6530
04:06:22,470 --> 04:06:23,590
He did a rotate.

6531
04:06:27,030 --> 04:06:28,250
I blew my nose, guys.

6532
04:06:28,490 --> 04:06:30,250
I'm too tired to mute right now.

6533
04:06:30,410 --> 04:06:30,810
I'm actually...

6534
04:06:31,790 --> 04:06:33,170
How do you think about a new season?

6535
04:06:34,530 --> 04:06:35,250
I mean...

6536
04:06:35,690 --> 04:06:36,050
Honestly...

6537
04:06:36,050 --> 04:06:37,650
Okay, I'm not sponsored, by the way.

6538
04:06:38,270 --> 04:06:38,630
I...

6539
04:06:38,630 --> 04:06:40,330
He just gave me early access.

6540
04:06:43,330 --> 04:06:44,070
Honestly...

6541
04:06:44,070 --> 04:06:44,630
It's Apex.

6542
04:06:45,410 --> 04:06:46,110
Uh...

6543
04:06:46,110 --> 04:06:46,910
Nothing...

6544
04:06:46,910 --> 04:06:48,590
Is really different...

6545
04:06:49,080 --> 04:06:49,450
From...

6546
04:06:49,450 --> 04:06:51,090
The last time I played Apex.

6547
04:06:52,000 --> 04:06:52,750
It's just...

6548
04:06:52,750 --> 04:06:54,030
Different guns are OP.

6549
04:06:54,390 --> 04:06:54,730
You know?

6550
04:06:57,150 --> 04:06:57,520
So...

6551
04:06:58,450 --> 04:06:59,190
Um...

6552
04:06:59,190 --> 04:07:00,030
There's more...

6553
04:07:00,030 --> 04:07:00,810
Movement play...

6554
04:07:00,810 --> 04:07:02,650
Like, it's just...

6555
04:07:02,650 --> 04:07:03,770
It's just...

6556
04:07:03,770 --> 04:07:04,310
Apex.

6557
04:07:04,490 --> 04:07:04,870
I...

6558
04:07:04,870 --> 04:07:07,110
I don't know what else to say.

6559
04:07:07,910 --> 04:07:10,530
Nothing really has changed much about it.

6560
04:07:12,530 --> 04:07:13,010
Uh...

6561
04:07:13,010 --> 04:07:14,010
But, yeah, no...

6562
04:07:14,010 --> 04:07:15,570
I mean, it's the time to kill.

6563
04:07:15,790 --> 04:07:16,670
You can tell that...

6564
04:07:16,670 --> 04:07:18,570
People die really fast in this game now.

6565
04:07:18,930 --> 04:07:20,590
Even more fast than...

6566
04:07:20,590 --> 04:07:21,910
Than in the past.

6567
04:07:22,710 --> 04:07:24,970
But, like, I've gotten used to it.

6568
04:07:25,150 --> 04:07:26,250
So, like, when you get peak...

6569
04:07:26,250 --> 04:07:28,730
Like, they punish you for really poor positioning.

6570
04:07:29,430 --> 04:07:30,550
And, like...

6571
04:07:30,950 --> 04:07:32,810
Obviously, my positioning isn't perfect.

6572
04:07:33,230 --> 04:07:35,410
Because it has been a while since I've played.

6573
04:07:35,410 --> 04:07:37,610
And, because it has been a while since I've played.

6574
04:07:38,370 --> 04:07:38,890
I...

6575
04:07:38,890 --> 04:07:39,190
Don't...

6576
04:07:39,190 --> 04:07:41,110
Really have really good positioning.

6577
04:07:41,390 --> 04:07:42,610
As I did in the past.

6578
04:07:43,030 --> 04:07:44,950
So, I do get punished really easily.

6579
04:07:45,170 --> 04:07:46,050
By better players.

6580
04:07:46,570 --> 04:07:48,090
I get punished really easily.

6581
04:07:48,670 --> 04:07:50,030
By better players.

6582
04:07:50,370 --> 04:07:51,270
Who have...

6583
04:07:51,270 --> 04:07:53,230
Who, like, notice I have bad positioning.

6584
04:07:54,390 --> 04:07:54,910
Um...

6585
04:07:54,910 --> 04:07:55,710
And I obviously...

6586
04:07:55,710 --> 04:07:56,710
I can't ego.

6587
04:07:57,030 --> 04:07:58,150
I can't ego people.

6588
04:08:00,070 --> 04:08:01,790
It seems a bit slower this patch.

6589
04:08:02,210 --> 04:08:04,270
I don't know if it is slower.

6590
04:08:04,270 --> 04:08:05,310
I can't tell.

6591
04:08:05,390 --> 04:08:05,910
Because I didn't play.

6592
04:08:06,150 --> 04:08:07,570
But when I played that time...

6593
04:08:07,570 --> 04:08:09,270
When I played the patch where...

6594
04:08:10,950 --> 04:08:11,450
Um...

6595
04:08:11,450 --> 04:08:12,950
When I played...

6596
04:08:12,950 --> 04:08:14,730
The patch...

6597
04:08:15,270 --> 04:08:15,570
With...

6598
04:08:15,570 --> 04:08:18,110
When they first introduce the time-to-kill.

6599
04:08:18,390 --> 04:08:20,310
I played one session of it.

6600
04:08:20,390 --> 04:08:21,190
And then I stopped.

6601
04:08:21,390 --> 04:08:23,210
Because I did not like the ttk.

6602
04:08:24,370 --> 04:08:24,870
Um...

6603
04:08:24,870 --> 04:08:32,190
Just because, like, I was not happy with... I was just not happy with the TTK, um, for it.

6604
04:08:32,950 --> 04:08:41,710
And so I can't tell if the TTK is better or not, but I just, um, I just, I didn't play a lot after that.

6605
04:08:41,970 --> 04:08:45,390
Oh my god, Brownstreet... Okay, let me not watch this person.

6606
04:08:45,650 --> 04:08:48,190
Let me watch someone else.

6607
04:08:53,870 --> 04:08:57,410
Let me, let me watch someone else after that.

6608
04:09:03,830 --> 04:09:05,950
Yeah, like, yeah, no.

6609
04:09:06,710 --> 04:09:09,890
Come on, I know there's people that still wanna play.

6610
04:09:10,250 --> 04:09:11,130
Come on!

6611
04:09:11,510 --> 04:09:12,410
Come on!

6612
04:09:12,670 --> 04:09:15,070
We can still make one more lobby!

6613
04:09:19,490 --> 04:09:22,470
We can still make one more lobby.

6614
04:09:22,830 --> 04:09:26,010
I hope there's more people watching the finals.

6615
04:09:26,510 --> 04:09:30,210
Um, as my pro friends were messaging me about it.

6616
04:09:30,510 --> 04:09:32,990
And, like, um...

6617
04:09:35,020 --> 04:09:39,970
I, I feel like, I feel like, I think it's just a hundred teams play thing.

6618
04:09:39,970 --> 04:09:43,770
I think there was a lot of, there was, like, uh...

6619
04:09:45,730 --> 04:09:47,250
Yeah, the LAN finals, yeah.

6620
04:09:47,990 --> 04:09:49,430
Yeah, they're actually there.

6621
04:09:49,630 --> 04:09:50,730
They're at the LAN finals.

6622
04:09:53,770 --> 04:09:55,670
I wasn't happy about the TTK changes.

6623
04:09:55,670 --> 04:09:57,390
I was just wasn't happy about it in general.

6624
04:09:58,630 --> 04:10:00,810
I think, like, I just don't like low...

6625
04:10:00,810 --> 04:10:04,210
I mean, like, if I want low TTK, I just play Call of Duty or some shit.

6626
04:10:04,210 --> 04:10:04,950
You know?

6627
04:10:05,490 --> 04:10:06,030
Like...

6628
04:10:06,030 --> 04:10:08,420
But the thing about Call of Duty is that I can respawn.

6629
04:10:09,990 --> 04:10:10,530
Um...

6630
04:10:11,060 --> 04:10:13,410
I, I can respawn really, really fast.

6631
04:10:13,810 --> 04:10:14,110
You know?

6632
04:10:14,710 --> 04:10:16,450
If I'm playing...

6633
04:10:17,490 --> 04:10:20,610
If I'm playing, like, like, Call of Duty or something.

6634
04:10:21,390 --> 04:10:22,410
But if I'm...

6635
04:10:22,410 --> 04:10:23,670
Oh my god, it went down.

6636
04:10:23,970 --> 04:10:25,070
It went down.

6637
04:10:25,070 --> 04:10:27,250
Oh my god, no.

6638
04:10:27,670 --> 04:10:29,190
Oh no.

6639
04:10:29,910 --> 04:10:31,590
It went down.

6640
04:10:32,310 --> 04:10:32,430
Oh no.

6641
04:10:32,890 --> 04:10:33,330
Fade!

6642
04:10:33,570 --> 04:10:34,550
Don't stop.

6643
04:10:34,950 --> 04:10:35,190
Cue!

6644
04:10:40,010 --> 04:10:41,710
It's over.

6645
04:10:44,050 --> 04:10:45,430
Oh my god.

6646
04:10:45,990 --> 04:10:46,630
No!

6647
04:10:47,150 --> 04:10:49,470
It's officially over!

6648
04:10:50,150 --> 04:10:52,270
It's officially over!

6649
04:10:55,690 --> 04:10:56,330
No!

6650
04:10:59,250 --> 04:10:59,890
No!

6651
04:11:01,350 --> 04:11:01,470
No!

6652
04:11:01,470 --> 04:11:03,470
Fade stopped queuing!

6653
04:11:04,470 --> 04:11:05,110
Fade!

6654
04:11:05,270 --> 04:11:05,890
I can't.

6655
04:11:06,070 --> 04:11:07,630
This can't be my last game.

6656
04:11:08,210 --> 04:11:09,590
Guys, I can't.

6657
04:11:11,550 --> 04:11:12,690
I can't.

6658
04:11:12,810 --> 04:11:13,730
I can't.

6659
04:11:13,850 --> 04:11:16,170
I refuse to let this be my last game.

6660
04:11:16,610 --> 04:11:18,010
I'm pulling it up.

6661
04:11:18,410 --> 04:11:20,470
I'm pulling it up.

6662
04:11:23,610 --> 04:11:24,890
This is it.

6663
04:11:25,790 --> 04:11:27,650
I'm pulling it up.

6664
04:11:33,950 --> 04:11:35,390
I'm pulling it up.

6665
04:11:35,830 --> 04:11:38,690
It's time for a quick normal Apex game.

6666
04:11:45,300 --> 04:11:46,600
This can't be it.

6667
04:11:46,600 --> 04:11:48,500
I'm not satisfied.

6668
04:11:49,600 --> 04:11:51,580
I'm not satisfied.

6669
04:11:52,640 --> 04:11:53,800
At all.

6670
04:11:58,680 --> 04:11:59,880
This is it.

6671
04:12:01,200 --> 04:12:01,880
Totally not.

6672
04:12:02,040 --> 04:12:03,860
No, I just need a good game.

6673
04:12:04,320 --> 04:12:04,940
That's the...

6674
04:12:04,940 --> 04:12:06,500
That's the adrenaline that's been...

6675
04:12:06,500 --> 04:12:07,920
I've been streaming for four hours.

6676
04:12:08,420 --> 04:12:09,100
Because...

6677
04:12:09,100 --> 04:12:11,000
I need a decent game.

6678
04:12:11,260 --> 04:12:13,660
Those games I had were so...

6679
04:12:13,660 --> 04:12:15,080
They were like...

6680
04:12:15,080 --> 04:12:15,740
Not it.

6681
04:12:15,740 --> 04:12:15,760
It.

6682
04:12:16,080 --> 04:12:17,780
Ha ha ha ha ha.

6683
04:12:19,060 --> 04:12:20,220
Ha ha ha.

6684
04:12:22,520 --> 04:12:23,480
Ha ha ha...

6685
04:12:23,480 --> 04:12:25,080
Ha ha ha ha ha.

6686
04:12:26,700 --> 04:12:28,680
Don't worry, I'm messaging people.

6687
04:12:29,220 --> 04:12:29,980
I mess...

6688
04:12:29,980 --> 04:12:31,740
I padded it with randoms.

6689
04:12:32,320 --> 04:12:33,020
This is...

6690
04:12:33,020 --> 04:12:33,820
I'm...

6691
04:12:33,820 --> 04:12:36,060
I'm hungry for victory.

6692
04:12:37,780 --> 04:12:40,720
I need a good win, and then I sleep.

6693
04:12:41,020 --> 04:12:42,380
And then I can...

6694
04:12:42,380 --> 04:12:43,400
rest easy.

6695
04:12:43,400 --> 04:12:47,060
I did not wake up at 9 a.m.

6696
04:12:47,480 --> 04:12:49,740
to not have a good game.

6697
04:12:50,500 --> 04:13:03,140
I... I did not wake up this early just to deal with that bullshit.

6698
04:13:05,580 --> 04:13:08,520
For my battle royale.

6699
04:13:09,180 --> 04:13:09,960
Oh!

6700
04:13:10,880 --> 04:13:12,660
I missed my...

6701
04:13:13,600 --> 04:13:14,840
Alright, let's see.

6702
04:13:17,480 --> 04:13:17,960
Alright.

6703
04:13:20,420 --> 04:13:21,400
Alright, don't worry.

6704
04:13:21,520 --> 04:13:22,140
Give me a sec.

6705
04:13:22,240 --> 04:13:26,980
Let me... Let me... I'll do, like, one... I'll do, like, a quick duo.

6706
04:13:27,820 --> 04:13:28,700
Real fast.

6707
04:13:28,840 --> 04:13:29,620
Alright, here you go.

6708
04:13:29,980 --> 04:13:32,940
I'm calling... I'm calling... I'm messaging people.

6709
04:13:37,580 --> 04:13:39,880
One good game is all I need!

6710
04:13:40,140 --> 04:13:41,240
And I'll be satisfied.

6711
04:13:41,880 --> 04:13:43,980
I can die happy.

6712
04:13:44,600 --> 04:13:48,360
I... No longer a prey dev.

6713
04:13:48,840 --> 04:13:50,740
No longer a dev.

6714
04:13:51,060 --> 04:13:54,640
No longer will I get to use my powers.

6715
04:13:58,020 --> 04:13:58,840
Alright.

6716
04:14:00,140 --> 04:14:02,060
I'm... Solo.

6717
04:14:03,040 --> 04:14:04,400
I should play...

6718
04:14:04,400 --> 04:14:13,760
Something... More... More... More, like, actual... Unga Bunga.

6719
04:14:13,940 --> 04:14:14,580
But fuck it.

6720
04:14:17,820 --> 04:14:18,960
It's okay.

6721
04:14:20,880 --> 04:14:21,740
Alright.

6722
04:14:22,180 --> 04:14:23,260
I believe.

6723
04:14:26,960 --> 04:14:28,460
She got spirit.

6724
04:14:28,800 --> 04:14:30,160
I got spirit, guys.

6725
04:14:33,470 --> 04:14:35,090
I got spirit.

6726
04:14:35,090 --> 04:14:36,530
How about you?

6727
04:14:38,890 --> 04:14:39,530
I don't know.

6728
04:14:39,690 --> 04:14:40,550
I don't play duos.

6729
04:14:40,750 --> 04:14:41,150
Hahaha.

6730
04:14:41,930 --> 04:14:42,450
Hahaha.

6731
04:14:43,530 --> 04:14:45,190
I don't... I don't play duos.

6732
04:14:45,310 --> 04:14:45,890
I don't know.

6733
04:14:50,030 --> 04:14:50,550
Alright.

6734
04:14:51,370 --> 04:14:52,330
Where are we landing?

6735
04:14:56,940 --> 04:14:58,560
Um... Is that still the plan?

6736
04:14:58,860 --> 04:15:01,400
Yeah, I'm gonna get ready accomplished for one game.

6737
04:15:01,800 --> 04:15:03,020
I'll do...

6738
04:15:04,920 --> 04:15:06,440
How are there no...

6739
04:15:09,320 --> 04:15:09,840
What?

6740
04:15:12,860 --> 04:15:13,900
There's no way.

6741
04:15:15,680 --> 04:15:17,660
Was this a house with zero guns?

6742
04:15:18,080 --> 04:15:19,240
Oh my god.

6743
04:15:19,400 --> 04:15:21,160
That was a house with zero guns.

6744
04:15:21,660 --> 04:15:22,260
That...

6745
04:15:25,120 --> 04:15:26,840
I got spirit.

6746
04:15:27,500 --> 04:15:28,840
How about you?

6747
04:15:31,200 --> 04:15:32,100
No more...

6748
04:15:32,100 --> 04:15:33,360
No more dev luck.

6749
04:15:33,360 --> 04:15:36,500
I still got spirit, guys.

6750
04:15:36,840 --> 04:15:38,820
Despite the circumstances.

6751
04:15:38,820 --> 04:15:41,020
I still got that spirit.

6752
04:15:41,740 --> 04:15:42,300
I...

6753
04:15:42,300 --> 04:15:45,020
That terrible...

6754
04:15:45,020 --> 04:15:46,360
Terrible spirit.

6755
04:15:48,060 --> 04:15:48,500
What?

6756
04:15:48,760 --> 04:15:50,920
My god left ins...

6757
04:15:50,920 --> 04:15:51,670
Oh my...

6758
04:15:51,670 --> 04:15:52,890
The ring closes in one minute.

6759
04:15:54,350 --> 04:15:54,990
Okay.

6760
04:15:55,370 --> 04:15:55,490
Okay.

6761
04:16:01,720 --> 04:16:02,800
Oh my god.

6762
04:16:02,940 --> 04:16:03,200
It's okay.

6763
04:16:03,360 --> 04:16:03,800
I got him.

6764
04:16:04,060 --> 04:16:04,120
No.

6765
04:16:04,460 --> 04:16:05,220
It's okay.

6766
04:16:05,840 --> 04:16:06,360
I...

6767
04:16:06,360 --> 04:16:07,260
Oh, okay.

6768
04:16:07,520 --> 04:16:08,080
That's...

6769
04:16:08,080 --> 04:16:10,580
I know what...

6770
04:16:10,580 --> 04:16:11,560
Real aim assist.

6771
04:16:12,060 --> 04:16:12,900
Let's go.

6772
04:16:13,600 --> 04:16:14,340
Let's go.

6773
04:16:14,700 --> 04:16:15,160
Aim assist.

6774
04:16:15,980 --> 04:16:17,200
Aim assist.

6775
04:16:17,500 --> 04:16:18,000
Let's go.

6776
04:16:18,560 --> 04:16:19,340
It's okay.

6777
04:16:20,140 --> 04:16:20,880
It's all right.

6778
04:16:21,060 --> 04:16:22,680
I still...

6779
04:16:22,680 --> 04:16:23,100
I'm...

6780
04:16:23,100 --> 04:16:23,640
I'm...

6781
04:16:23,640 --> 04:16:24,780
Do I wait?

6782
04:16:25,000 --> 04:16:25,260
Okay.

6783
04:16:25,540 --> 04:16:26,600
I'm waiting for...

6784
04:16:26,600 --> 04:16:26,900
All right.

6785
04:16:26,920 --> 04:16:27,220
You know what?

6786
04:16:27,280 --> 04:16:28,480
I'm gonna angry pee.

6787
04:16:28,700 --> 04:16:29,780
And then I'll be right back.

6788
04:16:30,240 --> 04:16:30,700
And...

6789
04:16:30,700 --> 04:16:30,930
I...

6790
04:16:32,100 --> 04:16:32,560
I...

6791
04:16:32,560 --> 04:16:32,620
I...

6792
04:16:32,620 --> 04:16:33,480
Be right back.

6793
04:17:25,790 --> 04:17:26,470
Defending me.

6794
04:17:26,590 --> 04:17:27,090
I'm angry.

6795
04:17:29,070 --> 04:17:29,710
That's it.

6796
04:17:29,910 --> 04:17:31,630
I'm gonna take it out on you.

6797
04:17:38,110 --> 04:17:38,970
That's right.

6798
04:17:41,090 --> 04:17:44,510
Now you'll never be my friend.

6799
04:17:45,470 --> 04:17:47,010
That's fucking right.

6800
04:17:51,750 --> 04:17:53,190
I'll do it again.

6801
04:17:53,990 --> 04:17:54,510
Bad.

6802
04:17:54,950 --> 04:17:55,670
What's your...

6803
04:17:55,670 --> 04:17:56,130
Who was it?

6804
04:17:56,190 --> 04:17:56,730
Who was straight?

6805
04:17:56,950 --> 04:17:59,050
I'll give you a mod if you tell me you're straight.

6806
04:17:59,630 --> 04:18:00,510
Who is it?

6807
04:18:03,540 --> 04:18:04,280
Who's straight?

6808
04:18:04,660 --> 04:18:05,480
It was I.

6809
04:18:05,960 --> 04:18:06,680
That's it.

6810
04:18:06,800 --> 04:18:07,320
I'm bad.

6811
04:18:08,380 --> 04:18:09,520
It's a trap.

6812
04:18:12,640 --> 04:18:14,280
I'm gonna take it out on you.

6813
04:18:14,440 --> 04:18:15,820
And I'm gonna bad you.

6814
04:18:17,100 --> 04:18:18,700
What did I do?

6815
04:18:19,580 --> 04:18:20,440
That's right.

6816
04:18:20,860 --> 04:18:21,760
I'm angry.

6817
04:18:22,220 --> 04:18:24,520
I need to let this out on someone.

6818
04:18:25,120 --> 04:18:26,020
That's right.

6819
04:18:27,140 --> 04:18:27,820
Go in.

6820
04:18:28,160 --> 04:18:29,380
Time out, corner.

6821
04:18:33,900 --> 04:18:36,500
But now you're gonna pay.

6822
04:18:36,960 --> 04:18:38,480
Daddy's angry.

6823
04:18:39,320 --> 04:18:41,080
Angry and tired.

6824
04:18:42,020 --> 04:18:43,320
As expected.

6825
04:18:44,240 --> 04:18:46,700
I'm not stable right now.

6826
04:18:47,360 --> 04:18:48,000
Poor shit.

6827
04:18:49,180 --> 04:18:51,420
That's not a full effect.

6828
04:18:52,080 --> 04:18:54,740
Oh, you wanna test me too, D-Dragon?

6829
04:18:55,260 --> 04:18:56,540
That didn't mean...

6830
04:18:56,540 --> 04:18:57,920
Don't worry.

6831
04:18:57,980 --> 04:18:59,740
I'm putting on a shirt real quick.

6832
04:19:03,740 --> 04:19:06,380
Do you have spirit?

6833
04:19:09,040 --> 04:19:10,560
Okay, I'll do it.

6834
04:19:10,760 --> 04:19:15,460
Look at how they massacred my bird.

6835
04:19:16,060 --> 04:19:16,640
Wow.

6836
04:19:21,350 --> 04:19:23,330
I am not...

6837
04:19:23,330 --> 04:19:24,650
Daddy's angry.

6838
04:19:25,210 --> 04:19:25,990
Lucy!

6839
04:19:26,430 --> 04:19:27,610
Daddy's angry!

6840
04:19:32,510 --> 04:19:33,390
It's okay.

6841
04:19:33,530 --> 04:19:33,950
I'm okay.

6842
04:19:34,230 --> 04:19:34,830
I'm okay.

6843
04:19:38,930 --> 04:19:39,990
I'm okay.

6844
04:19:41,290 --> 04:19:42,390
Wait, okay.

6845
04:19:43,470 --> 04:19:44,370
Someone responded.

6846
04:19:44,710 --> 04:19:46,050
I messaged like...

6847
04:19:46,050 --> 04:19:47,070
Three people.

6848
04:19:51,930 --> 04:19:53,210
Fine, I don't care.

6849
04:19:53,330 --> 04:19:54,110
I'll take anything.

6850
04:19:54,430 --> 04:19:55,350
I'll take it.

6851
04:19:55,990 --> 04:19:56,670
Alright.

6852
04:20:00,620 --> 04:20:01,240
Alright.

6853
04:20:01,540 --> 04:20:02,040
This is it.

6854
04:20:02,160 --> 04:20:03,300
This is my one game.

6855
04:20:03,960 --> 04:20:05,220
That's not my one game.

6856
04:20:05,320 --> 04:20:05,960
I swear to God.

6857
04:20:06,580 --> 04:20:08,900
If this person doesn't...

6858
04:20:09,540 --> 04:20:10,160
Doesn't...

6859
04:20:10,160 --> 04:20:11,100
Pull up.

6860
04:20:11,620 --> 04:20:12,400
I'm kidding.

6861
04:20:12,920 --> 04:20:13,540
I'm...

6862
04:20:13,540 --> 04:20:13,820
I'm...

6863
04:20:13,820 --> 04:20:15,480
I'm banning them from my channel.

6864
04:20:16,020 --> 04:20:16,300
I...

6865
04:20:19,660 --> 04:20:22,020
They'll never be able to...

6866
04:20:22,020 --> 04:20:23,720
BM on my channel.

6867
04:20:23,900 --> 04:20:25,420
I'm banning them on my channel.

6868
04:20:25,660 --> 04:20:27,740
And also on my Twitch, too.

6869
04:20:28,300 --> 04:20:28,720
I...

6870
04:20:30,680 --> 04:20:32,220
That's right.

6871
04:20:34,820 --> 04:20:36,480
Daddy's angry.

6872
04:20:39,040 --> 04:20:40,160
Alright.

6873
04:20:41,740 --> 04:20:43,240
Let's go.

6874
04:20:43,560 --> 04:20:44,540
Let's go.

6875
04:20:45,880 --> 04:20:46,740
That's rough.

6876
04:20:47,160 --> 04:20:47,920
Don't worry.

6877
04:20:48,720 --> 04:20:49,280
Uh...

6878
04:20:49,840 --> 04:20:50,400
Quiet.

6879
04:20:51,040 --> 04:20:52,640
You do not speak.

6880
04:21:01,380 --> 04:21:03,020
No rights.

6881
04:21:09,720 --> 04:21:11,340
Yoki angry.

6882
04:21:12,580 --> 04:21:14,320
One good game.

6883
04:21:14,600 --> 04:21:15,700
That's all I need.

6884
04:21:15,860 --> 04:21:16,900
And I'll be happy.

6885
04:21:20,980 --> 04:21:21,680
All right.

6886
04:21:22,540 --> 04:21:23,660
The power of views.

6887
04:21:23,820 --> 04:21:24,120
It's okay.

6888
04:21:24,260 --> 04:21:25,100
He has his YouTube link.

6889
04:21:25,160 --> 04:21:26,460
So I know what his channel name is.

6890
04:21:26,880 --> 04:21:27,200
I...

6891
04:21:27,200 --> 04:21:27,740
I know.

6892
04:21:30,780 --> 04:21:31,580
All right.

6893
04:21:32,620 --> 04:21:33,460
Let's go.

6894
04:21:35,100 --> 04:21:36,060
Doki angry.

6895
04:21:38,800 --> 04:21:41,360
I'm tired and I'm angry.

6896
04:21:42,260 --> 04:21:44,300
I have lots of struggles.

6897
04:21:45,400 --> 04:21:47,860
I will walk all over.

6898
04:21:54,630 --> 04:21:55,250
All right.

6899
04:21:59,680 --> 04:22:00,980
This is it.

6900
04:22:01,740 --> 04:22:03,460
I shall feel...

6901
04:22:03,460 --> 04:22:04,160
It's just...

6902
04:22:04,160 --> 04:22:05,580
I will feel joy today.

6903
04:22:06,020 --> 04:22:08,360
And I can finally rest.

6904
04:22:10,320 --> 04:22:11,280
It's like...

6905
04:22:11,280 --> 04:22:11,460
Okay.

6906
04:22:11,920 --> 04:22:12,920
For anyone that...

6907
04:22:12,920 --> 04:22:13,140
I don't...

6908
04:22:13,140 --> 04:22:14,320
I normally don't watch Doctor...

6909
04:22:14,320 --> 04:22:15,260
I don't watch Doctor Who.

6910
04:22:15,540 --> 04:22:18,200
But there was a viral episode recently.

6911
04:22:18,640 --> 04:22:20,820
That was related to like...

6912
04:22:20,820 --> 04:22:22,320
Don't make me laugh.

6913
04:22:22,640 --> 04:22:24,000
Like that animation guy.

6914
04:22:24,440 --> 04:22:24,920
What was it?

6915
04:22:24,920 --> 04:22:25,780
I don't remember his name.

6916
04:22:26,000 --> 04:22:27,180
I don't remember his name.

6917
04:22:27,180 --> 04:22:28,300
But like he's like...

6918
04:22:28,300 --> 04:22:30,320
He's really quirky and whatever.

6919
04:22:30,840 --> 04:22:31,280
But...

6920
04:22:32,960 --> 04:22:33,400
The...

6921
04:22:33,400 --> 04:22:33,780
The...

6922
04:22:33,780 --> 04:22:33,840
Yeah.

6923
04:22:34,020 --> 04:22:34,260
It was...

6924
04:22:34,260 --> 04:22:35,940
There was a recent Doctor Who episode.

6925
04:22:37,020 --> 04:22:37,460
And...

6926
04:22:37,960 --> 04:22:40,000
It was based off of like this...

6927
04:22:40,500 --> 04:22:41,840
This animated guy.

6928
04:22:42,460 --> 04:22:42,660
Yeah.

6929
04:22:43,060 --> 04:22:43,920
Oh my god.

6930
04:22:43,960 --> 04:22:44,780
What was his name?

6931
04:22:44,820 --> 04:22:45,340
I don't remember.

6932
04:22:45,440 --> 04:22:46,760
It was based off of like...

6933
04:22:46,760 --> 04:22:47,140
Rupert.

6934
04:22:47,280 --> 04:22:48,100
Mr. Ring-a-Ding.

6935
04:22:48,200 --> 04:22:48,540
Yes!

6936
04:22:48,800 --> 04:22:49,960
Mr. Ring-a-Ding.

6937
04:22:50,040 --> 04:22:50,180
Okay.

6938
04:22:50,200 --> 04:22:50,860
That's his name.

6939
04:22:50,980 --> 04:22:51,760
And he was in the doctor...

6940
04:22:51,760 --> 04:22:52,980
I actually like...

6941
04:22:52,980 --> 04:22:54,600
Really enjoyed this episode.

6942
04:22:55,140 --> 04:22:56,780
I watched like little moments of it.

6943
04:22:56,780 --> 04:22:57,900
Because I thought it was like...

6944
04:22:57,900 --> 04:22:58,400
Really funny.

6945
04:22:58,660 --> 04:22:59,620
And really cute.

6946
04:22:59,920 --> 04:23:00,940
And then like...

6947
04:23:00,940 --> 04:23:02,300
In the end of the episode...

6948
04:23:02,300 --> 04:23:02,860
The thing is...

6949
04:23:02,860 --> 04:23:03,360
He was like...

6950
04:23:03,360 --> 04:23:04,620
A god of light or whatever.

6951
04:23:04,940 --> 04:23:06,720
And then he ascended into heaven.

6952
04:23:07,040 --> 04:23:08,120
Into like the universe.

6953
04:23:08,360 --> 04:23:09,320
And then faded out.

6954
04:23:09,500 --> 04:23:11,080
Because all he wanted was light.

6955
04:23:11,200 --> 04:23:13,300
But because the sun gave him light...

6956
04:23:13,300 --> 04:23:13,980
He like...

6957
04:23:13,980 --> 04:23:15,560
Fucking grew bigger and bigger.

6958
04:23:15,700 --> 04:23:16,700
And then he grew so big.

6959
04:23:16,720 --> 04:23:18,600
And then he ascended into a universe.

6960
04:23:18,800 --> 04:23:19,660
And then just...

6961
04:23:19,660 --> 04:23:21,280
Faded out and disappeared.

6962
04:23:21,540 --> 04:23:22,280
And he was like...

6963
04:23:22,280 --> 04:23:22,780
He's like...

6964
04:23:22,780 --> 04:23:23,600
I did it.

6965
04:23:23,680 --> 04:23:24,960
And then a tear dropped back.

6966
04:23:25,000 --> 04:23:25,560
That's me.

6967
04:23:25,560 --> 04:23:27,680
Yeah, he merged with the atmosphere.

6968
04:23:27,880 --> 04:23:28,340
That's me.

6969
04:23:28,640 --> 04:23:32,060
The moment I win that one game, I will be him.

6970
04:23:33,320 --> 04:23:38,760
I shall ascend to the universe and merge into the atmosphere.

6971
04:23:41,840 --> 04:23:45,820
I know that's like a reference that only 1% of you got.

6972
04:23:46,260 --> 04:23:50,140
But you... Please, YouTube MrRingading ending.

6973
04:23:50,460 --> 04:23:52,900
And then you'll... I'm gonna give you guys that clip.

6974
04:23:52,900 --> 04:23:57,480
When we win that game, I'm giving you guys that clip, and you'll understand, like, how I feel.

6975
04:23:57,900 --> 04:24:01,500
You'll... You'll understand.

6976
04:24:01,980 --> 04:24:03,200
I'm too far.

6977
04:24:03,420 --> 04:24:03,880
God.

6978
04:24:04,880 --> 04:24:07,600
I know, I'm speaking, like, in tongues right now.

6979
04:24:07,600 --> 04:24:09,440
I'm so fucking tired.

6980
04:24:09,920 --> 04:24:12,720
I've been streaming Apex for 4 hours.

6981
04:24:12,920 --> 04:24:14,520
I'm fucking exhausted.

6982
04:24:17,020 --> 04:24:19,820
And I've had 3 hours of sleep.

6983
04:24:21,980 --> 04:24:23,620
I'm just too far gone.

6984
04:24:23,800 --> 04:24:25,960
Yeah, I'm way too far gone.

6985
04:24:28,040 --> 04:24:29,600
Don't make me laugh.

6986
04:24:30,080 --> 04:24:30,860
Ha ha ha.

6987
04:24:31,440 --> 04:24:32,100
Ha ha ha.

6988
04:24:33,640 --> 04:24:34,620
Ba ba dum.

6989
04:24:35,120 --> 04:24:36,280
Boom boom boom.

6990
04:24:36,760 --> 04:24:37,740
One minute.

6991
04:24:37,900 --> 04:24:39,780
We have time to strategize.

6992
04:24:40,100 --> 04:24:41,420
I don't even... I should...

6993
04:24:41,420 --> 04:24:43,980
Oh yeah, this is like...

6994
04:24:43,980 --> 04:24:45,680
Pre-nerf.

6995
04:24:46,020 --> 04:24:46,580
So...

6996
04:24:46,580 --> 04:24:47,980
I should grab...

6997
04:24:50,380 --> 04:24:50,940
Grab...

6998
04:24:50,940 --> 04:24:53,460
And then...

6999
04:24:53,460 --> 04:24:55,180
This is pre-nerf, so I can do this.

7000
04:24:55,700 --> 04:24:56,780
And then I'll just do this.

7001
04:24:57,000 --> 04:24:57,960
And then I'll get double.

7002
04:24:58,920 --> 04:24:59,400
Yeah!

7003
04:25:01,840 --> 04:25:03,140
Don't make me laugh!

7004
04:25:04,460 --> 04:25:05,020
Alright.

7005
04:25:05,980 --> 04:25:07,680
I'm going to fight!

7006
04:25:08,840 --> 04:25:10,140
I don't care!

7007
04:25:10,600 --> 04:25:11,240
We fight!

7008
04:25:13,860 --> 04:25:14,900
We fight!

7009
04:25:15,120 --> 04:25:16,200
We're not pussies!

7010
04:25:18,560 --> 04:25:20,220
I need to feel something.

7011
04:25:24,530 --> 04:25:25,950
No, I meant the P20.

7012
04:25:26,150 --> 04:25:27,730
They nerfed the P20 a little, apparently.

7013
04:25:28,610 --> 04:25:30,030
Anyone land on that side?

7014
04:25:31,910 --> 04:25:32,510
No.

7015
04:25:32,810 --> 04:25:33,710
God damn it!

7016
04:25:34,010 --> 04:25:35,170
Nobody landed here!

7017
04:25:39,300 --> 04:25:40,180
Nobody...

7018
04:25:40,180 --> 04:25:42,600
Nobody landed here.

7019
04:25:43,500 --> 04:25:44,360
It's...

7020
04:25:44,360 --> 04:25:44,680
Bronze.

7021
04:25:48,300 --> 04:25:49,840
He has zero.

7022
04:25:50,000 --> 04:25:51,620
I went through hell!

7023
04:25:52,260 --> 04:25:54,340
I had to fight pro players!

7024
04:25:55,800 --> 04:25:59,060
I had to fight pros and ex-pros!

7025
04:25:59,420 --> 04:26:01,580
This is bronze elo!

7026
04:26:03,080 --> 04:26:05,680
Pro players on controller!

7027
04:26:07,020 --> 04:26:08,700
That's the worst combination!

7028
04:26:10,140 --> 04:26:10,840
Bro...

7029
04:26:10,840 --> 04:26:14,700
I just went through that for three hours straight.

7030
04:26:19,340 --> 04:26:20,620
This is nothing.

7031
04:26:20,940 --> 04:26:22,370
I'm going to get absolutely demolished.

7032
04:26:22,820 --> 04:26:23,760
I ran out.

7033
04:26:23,960 --> 04:26:25,060
After saying that.

7034
04:26:25,980 --> 04:26:27,400
I can feel it.

7035
04:26:27,900 --> 04:26:32,040
I can feel karma slapping me in the face.

7036
04:26:32,040 --> 04:26:33,640
And going...

7037
04:26:33,640 --> 04:26:35,560
And being like...

7038
04:26:35,560 --> 04:26:36,140
Knock, knock!

7039
04:26:38,040 --> 04:26:40,140
Where is anybody?

7040
04:26:41,760 --> 04:26:43,300
I'll go that way?

7041
04:26:43,760 --> 04:26:45,480
Oh no, he's coming to me.

7042
04:26:46,100 --> 04:26:46,400
Okay.

7043
04:26:48,260 --> 04:26:49,920
I'm taking this!

7044
04:26:50,060 --> 04:26:51,100
Will I die?

7045
04:26:51,440 --> 04:26:52,900
It's time to find out!

7046
04:26:53,260 --> 04:26:56,040
The support player is going all in!

7047
04:26:59,540 --> 04:27:00,840
No one was here.

7048
04:27:01,500 --> 04:27:02,600
Doors aren't open.

7049
04:27:03,180 --> 04:27:05,680
Where the fuck is...

7050
04:27:05,680 --> 04:27:06,580
Oh my god.

7051
04:27:07,180 --> 04:27:09,360
Actually, I shouldn't be so cocky right now.

7052
04:27:09,500 --> 04:27:10,420
I'm not okay.

7053
04:27:11,000 --> 04:27:12,300
I'm not okay.

7054
04:27:12,880 --> 04:27:15,920
I should not be so cocky.

7055
04:27:16,580 --> 04:27:20,400
With like the amount of energy I have.

7056
04:27:23,680 --> 04:27:25,220
I've cooked too hard.

7057
04:27:25,480 --> 04:27:26,140
It's overcooked.

7058
04:27:28,980 --> 04:27:29,880
It's fine.

7059
04:27:29,900 --> 04:27:31,200
I don't need streamer mode.

7060
04:27:32,440 --> 04:27:33,840
I don't need it.

7061
04:27:35,280 --> 04:27:36,560
I need...

7062
04:27:36,560 --> 04:27:36,880
Like...

7063
04:27:36,880 --> 04:27:38,620
Please, let me kill one person.

7064
04:27:38,840 --> 04:27:40,900
Let me at least kill one team.

7065
04:27:44,420 --> 04:27:46,520
Where the fuck is anybody?

7066
04:27:46,960 --> 04:27:49,060
I don't know the rotations in this.

7067
04:27:49,880 --> 04:27:51,060
In this area.

7068
04:28:03,330 --> 04:28:03,890
Where?

7069
04:28:04,130 --> 04:28:04,750
Oh my god.

7070
04:28:04,810 --> 04:28:05,390
I'm going to...

7071
04:28:05,390 --> 04:28:06,230
Fuck this.

7072
04:28:07,070 --> 04:28:08,010
I'll take that.

7073
04:28:08,290 --> 04:28:10,630
I'm gonna go...

7074
04:28:10,630 --> 04:28:11,970
To Cascade.

7075
04:28:12,110 --> 04:28:12,710
There's always people.

7076
04:28:12,810 --> 04:28:13,490
Oh shit!

7077
04:28:19,480 --> 04:28:20,040
Nice.

7078
04:28:24,360 --> 04:28:25,300
Where is he?

7079
04:28:25,960 --> 04:28:27,420
Oh, he ran off.

7080
04:28:29,600 --> 04:28:30,580
That's fine.

7081
04:28:31,700 --> 04:28:32,660
It's fine.

7082
04:28:32,900 --> 04:28:33,320
It's fine.

7083
04:28:33,320 --> 04:28:33,940
I'm okay.

7084
04:28:35,180 --> 04:28:36,140
It's fine.

7085
04:28:40,900 --> 04:28:41,960
Let me in.

7086
04:28:42,060 --> 04:28:42,600
Let me in.

7087
04:28:42,660 --> 04:28:43,200
Let me in.

7088
04:28:43,200 --> 04:28:44,080
I want to fight!

7089
04:28:45,040 --> 04:28:48,200
I only got delayed because of that fucker.

7090
04:28:48,440 --> 04:28:50,680
For throwing in a fucking balloon at me.

7091
04:28:53,140 --> 04:28:54,080
We're astray.

7092
04:28:54,500 --> 04:28:54,900
Mons!

7093
04:28:55,100 --> 04:28:56,320
Give him another time out.

7094
04:28:57,200 --> 04:29:00,060
I didn't get that kill, so now I'm extra angry.

7095
04:29:03,920 --> 04:29:07,660
Daddy didn't get that kill, so daddy's mad now.

7096
04:29:08,280 --> 04:29:09,020
Wait, what the fuck?

7097
04:29:09,720 --> 04:29:10,520
Oh my god, no.

7098
04:29:10,940 --> 04:29:11,740
Wait, daddy's scared.

7099
04:29:12,160 --> 04:29:12,660
Daddy's scared.

7100
04:29:16,240 --> 04:29:18,060
Wait, daddy was not expecting that.

7101
04:29:21,780 --> 04:29:23,760
Was not expecting the third part.

7102
04:29:26,140 --> 04:29:27,280
Jesus, he's one.

7103
04:29:27,540 --> 04:29:28,240
He's actually...

7104
04:29:29,600 --> 04:29:30,580
Okay, that's fine.

7105
04:29:33,880 --> 04:29:34,400
Nice.

7106
04:29:34,940 --> 04:29:36,220
Okay, I'm not angry anymore.

7107
04:29:36,220 --> 04:29:37,300
You don't have to ban him.

7108
04:29:39,480 --> 04:29:40,080
Don't worry.

7109
04:29:40,140 --> 04:29:41,180
I'm not angry anymore.

7110
04:29:41,420 --> 04:29:41,960
I'm fine.

7111
04:29:45,920 --> 04:29:46,680
It's okay.

7112
04:29:46,960 --> 04:29:48,360
He can be unbanned now.

7113
04:29:48,480 --> 04:29:49,260
I got a kill.

7114
04:29:49,860 --> 04:29:51,220
I got a kill.

7115
04:29:51,560 --> 04:29:52,800
Too late.

7116
04:29:53,880 --> 04:29:54,320
No, no.

7117
04:29:54,420 --> 04:29:54,740
It's fine.

7118
04:29:54,760 --> 04:29:55,580
I'm okay now.

7119
04:29:55,800 --> 04:29:56,260
I'm okay.

7120
04:29:57,140 --> 04:29:58,100
I'm satisfied.

7121
04:30:00,420 --> 04:30:03,300
I'm mood-dependent moderation.

7122
04:30:03,940 --> 04:30:05,780
As it should be.

7123
04:30:08,040 --> 04:30:10,540
There's so much power in my hands.

7124
04:30:10,560 --> 04:30:12,480
I shall use it for not good.

7125
04:30:16,280 --> 04:30:18,600
I have been sated.

7126
04:30:19,820 --> 04:30:23,000
My blood first has been satisfied.

7127
04:30:23,620 --> 04:30:25,240
Their jail first...

7128
04:30:28,780 --> 04:30:29,840
It's fine.

7129
04:30:39,020 --> 04:30:39,580
Where are they?

7130
04:30:42,260 --> 04:30:43,400
Where actually are they?

7131
04:30:44,900 --> 04:30:46,140
I hear them healing.

7132
04:30:53,990 --> 04:30:55,270
Yeah, up high ground.

7133
04:30:55,550 --> 04:30:56,010
Fuck this.

7134
04:30:57,310 --> 04:30:58,230
Oh, what the fuck?

7135
04:30:58,310 --> 04:30:58,790
Where am I?

7136
04:31:01,090 --> 04:31:02,250
That has cover?

7137
04:31:02,450 --> 04:31:03,890
They took off the cover?

7138
04:31:05,230 --> 04:31:06,110
Since when?

7139
04:31:07,110 --> 04:31:07,890
I don't know.

7140
04:31:07,990 --> 04:31:09,490
I clearly don't know this map anymore.

7141
04:31:13,270 --> 04:31:13,790
Hello?

7142
04:31:16,430 --> 04:31:17,990
Let me kill.

7143
04:31:23,160 --> 04:31:24,660
Let me kill.

7144
04:31:26,060 --> 04:31:27,220
Where's the door?

7145
04:31:28,960 --> 04:31:30,380
Where's the door?

7146
04:31:30,640 --> 04:31:33,540
I don't know where the door was.

7147
04:31:34,160 --> 04:31:34,600
Alright.

7148
04:31:35,260 --> 04:31:36,600
I was so confused.

7149
04:31:38,780 --> 04:31:39,900
Alright, nice.

7150
04:31:44,120 --> 04:31:44,900
Where?

7151
04:31:45,200 --> 04:31:46,500
Okay, let me enhance this.

7152
04:31:47,880 --> 04:31:48,560
Alright.

7153
04:31:49,420 --> 04:31:51,080
Oh, I should grab ammo.

7154
04:31:51,320 --> 04:31:52,880
I'm not thinking right now.

7155
04:31:54,780 --> 04:31:56,320
I'm not thinking.

7156
04:31:57,060 --> 04:31:58,960
I want a frag!

7157
04:32:00,160 --> 04:32:01,080
I'm going this way.

7158
04:32:02,480 --> 04:32:04,380
There's surely something over there, right?

7159
04:32:07,290 --> 04:32:08,250
Knock, knock.

7160
04:32:09,190 --> 04:32:10,210
Knock, knock.

7161
04:32:13,710 --> 04:32:14,370
Knock.

7162
04:32:14,670 --> 04:32:15,070
Knock, knock.

7163
04:32:15,350 --> 04:32:16,750
He's only half the battle.

7164
04:32:17,890 --> 04:32:18,190
Hello?

7165
04:32:20,050 --> 04:32:20,710
Hello?

7166
04:32:21,890 --> 04:32:22,550
Hello?

7167
04:32:24,890 --> 04:32:26,290
Where are people at?

7168
04:32:30,700 --> 04:32:31,540
Who's there?

7169
04:32:35,740 --> 04:32:37,760
Anything is funny to me now.

7170
04:32:39,060 --> 04:32:40,660
That's how gone I am.

7171
04:32:43,760 --> 04:32:45,040
I don't see anybody.

7172
04:32:51,000 --> 04:32:52,680
Wait, our ass should know.

7173
04:32:53,080 --> 04:32:54,660
He has like...

7174
04:33:03,050 --> 04:33:04,470
Oh my god.

7175
04:33:06,110 --> 04:33:07,770
I think I almost took someone down with me.

7176
04:33:09,430 --> 04:33:11,550
I was too bloodthirsty.

7177
04:33:12,210 --> 04:33:13,810
Why are you running?

7178
04:33:13,810 --> 04:33:15,970
Oh my god.

7179
04:33:17,310 --> 04:33:18,670
Oh, he's won.

7180
04:33:18,830 --> 04:33:19,430
He's won.

7181
04:33:19,650 --> 04:33:20,030
No way.

7182
04:33:20,230 --> 04:33:21,150
He's actually won.

7183
04:33:22,270 --> 04:33:22,870
No.

7184
04:33:23,510 --> 04:33:23,610
No.

7185
04:33:23,830 --> 04:33:24,450
Res me, please.

7186
04:33:24,650 --> 04:33:25,790
I'm so resable.

7187
04:33:26,550 --> 04:33:26,710
Please.

7188
04:33:27,530 --> 04:33:30,070
I'm actually so resable right here.

7189
04:33:30,470 --> 04:33:31,790
Gomez, I swear to god.

7190
04:33:32,250 --> 04:33:33,990
Res me or I kick.

7191
04:33:33,990 --> 04:33:38,790
The old me would have let you rot.

7192
04:33:38,950 --> 04:33:40,050
Get down again.

7193
04:33:40,410 --> 04:33:41,590
And I still might.

7194
04:33:41,710 --> 04:33:42,790
I might die though.

7195
04:33:43,370 --> 04:33:43,910
100%.

7196
04:33:45,850 --> 04:33:46,390
XD.

7197
04:33:48,890 --> 04:33:50,030
It's a new team.

7198
04:33:50,250 --> 04:33:50,890
It's a new team.

7199
04:33:50,890 --> 04:33:50,890
Oh.

7200
04:33:51,230 --> 04:33:51,870
No.

7201
04:33:52,430 --> 04:33:53,950
I... You have no... Oh my god.

7202
04:33:54,050 --> 04:33:54,870
There is another team!

7203
04:33:56,170 --> 04:33:57,770
There is a...

7204
04:33:57,770 --> 04:33:59,090
Oh my god.

7205
04:34:03,340 --> 04:34:05,920
Oh my god.

7206
04:34:05,920 --> 04:34:07,360
To say he has no right to talk.

7207
04:34:07,560 --> 04:34:09,200
And then a new team showed up.

7208
04:34:09,700 --> 04:34:10,800
Oh my god.

7209
04:34:12,820 --> 04:34:14,800
I was like, who gave you that right?

7210
04:34:15,080 --> 04:34:16,240
To speak to me.

7211
04:34:19,460 --> 04:34:20,940
Oh my god.

7212
04:34:21,160 --> 04:34:21,560
Oh my god.

7213
04:34:24,500 --> 04:34:25,680
Oh my god.

7214
04:34:27,380 --> 04:34:28,020
Okay.

7215
04:34:30,040 --> 04:34:30,920
That's fine.

7216
04:34:31,480 --> 04:34:32,520
That's fine.

7217
04:34:34,840 --> 04:34:35,760
I'm okay.

7218
04:34:37,040 --> 04:34:37,980
We're okay.

7219
04:34:40,840 --> 04:34:41,660
Oh wait.

7220
04:34:41,740 --> 04:34:42,460
It's a yellow bin.

7221
04:34:42,760 --> 04:34:43,260
You know what?

7222
04:34:43,360 --> 04:34:43,780
That's good.

7223
04:34:45,540 --> 04:34:47,200
Where did they all come from?

7224
04:34:51,240 --> 04:34:52,200
Jesus Christ.

7225
04:34:52,480 --> 04:34:54,020
Where did all these people come from?

7226
04:34:55,440 --> 04:34:56,280
I'm going back up.

7227
04:34:56,660 --> 04:34:57,860
I didn't learn my lesson.

7228
04:35:02,150 --> 04:35:03,450
I'm going back up there.

7229
04:35:03,530 --> 04:35:04,750
I didn't learn my lesson, guys.

7230
04:35:07,370 --> 04:35:08,090
Let's go.

7231
04:35:13,810 --> 04:35:14,290
Wow.

7232
04:35:14,870 --> 04:35:15,370
It's right here.

7233
04:35:18,310 --> 04:35:19,850
I'm going to just freely run.

7234
04:35:20,910 --> 04:35:22,070
Oh, he saw me.

7235
04:35:26,410 --> 04:35:27,430
He saw me.

7236
04:35:32,710 --> 04:35:33,510
That's fine.

7237
04:35:37,930 --> 04:35:38,450
Ooh.

7238
04:35:38,930 --> 04:35:39,930
Nice shot, though.

7239
04:35:40,150 --> 04:35:41,490
I was trying to jiggle peek that.

7240
04:35:44,130 --> 04:35:44,650
Oh.

7241
04:35:45,110 --> 04:35:45,710
Come on.

7242
04:35:48,930 --> 04:35:49,730
It's fine.

7243
04:35:49,930 --> 04:35:50,830
You know what I have?

7244
04:35:51,970 --> 04:35:52,410
Wait.

7245
04:35:52,550 --> 04:35:53,270
I had that, too.

7246
04:35:53,410 --> 04:35:53,490
Yeah.

7247
04:35:53,590 --> 04:35:55,150
I had that, but...

7248
04:35:57,390 --> 04:35:57,830
Alright.

7249
04:35:57,930 --> 04:35:58,330
Let's go.

7250
04:35:58,710 --> 04:35:59,950
I had that, too.

7251
04:36:01,490 --> 04:36:01,930
Alright.

7252
04:36:02,030 --> 04:36:02,670
Where do we go?

7253
04:36:02,850 --> 04:36:03,050
Alright.

7254
04:36:03,250 --> 04:36:03,670
We follow.

7255
04:36:06,090 --> 04:36:07,270
Where is he going?

7256
04:36:08,470 --> 04:36:09,310
Oh, shit.

7257
04:36:09,450 --> 04:36:09,630
Okay.

7258
04:36:10,370 --> 04:36:11,850
We're going straight back in it.

7259
04:36:13,010 --> 04:36:13,650
That's right.

7260
04:36:14,650 --> 04:36:15,830
Oh, shit!

7261
04:36:16,430 --> 04:36:16,950
What?

7262
04:36:18,230 --> 04:36:19,170
Yeah.

7263
04:36:19,790 --> 04:36:21,050
He's still aiming?

7264
04:36:26,170 --> 04:36:27,210
Freak!

7265
04:36:32,800 --> 04:36:33,720
Fucking freak!

7266
04:36:37,680 --> 04:36:38,420
Oh, no.

7267
04:36:38,520 --> 04:36:39,060
I don't have ammo.

7268
04:36:39,700 --> 04:36:40,860
Oh, no.

7269
04:36:41,820 --> 04:36:42,340
Reloading.

7270
04:36:44,180 --> 04:36:45,140
Below me.

7271
04:36:45,460 --> 04:36:45,980
Oh, no.

7272
04:36:46,160 --> 04:36:47,480
I don't have ammo for this.

7273
04:36:48,200 --> 04:36:49,120
Oh, no.

7274
04:36:51,760 --> 04:36:53,040
I need energy ammo.

7275
04:36:53,140 --> 04:36:54,480
This brawn is so good, bro.

7276
04:36:55,920 --> 04:36:56,680
That's what I'm saying.

7277
04:36:56,800 --> 04:36:57,380
This is brawn.

7278
04:36:57,540 --> 04:36:58,040
What the fuck?

7279
04:37:02,080 --> 04:37:03,280
I need ammo.

7280
04:37:03,520 --> 04:37:04,260
Oh, my God.

7281
04:37:05,680 --> 04:37:06,340
Fuck this.

7282
04:37:07,120 --> 04:37:08,300
This is my ammo.

7283
04:37:14,230 --> 04:37:15,330
Jesus Christ.

7284
04:37:15,910 --> 04:37:17,870
I might need to put this scope in.

7285
04:37:20,270 --> 04:37:22,390
I cannot do it with R9.

7286
04:37:22,690 --> 04:37:23,350
It's too far.

7287
04:37:23,530 --> 04:37:24,690
I need energy.

7288
04:37:25,450 --> 04:37:26,190
I'm out of energy.

7289
04:37:29,530 --> 04:37:30,590
I'm going in.

7290
04:37:31,390 --> 04:37:32,350
I'm going...

7291
04:37:32,790 --> 04:37:33,630
I'm going in.

7292
04:37:34,670 --> 04:37:35,630
This is it.

7293
04:37:36,950 --> 04:37:38,110
Wait, we could craft.

7294
04:37:38,450 --> 04:37:38,750
You're right.

7295
04:37:40,230 --> 04:37:40,830
Or...

7296
04:37:40,830 --> 04:37:41,630
Oh, my God.

7297
04:37:41,650 --> 04:37:42,330
I'll go craft.

7298
04:37:45,410 --> 04:37:46,650
I need a craft.

7299
04:37:50,350 --> 04:37:51,510
Oh, I could craft him.

7300
04:37:56,610 --> 04:37:58,370
This is clearly more important.

7301
04:37:59,590 --> 04:38:00,370
There's no way.

7302
04:38:00,470 --> 04:38:01,530
I was going to say there's...

7303
04:38:02,430 --> 04:38:03,550
There's no way.

7304
04:38:04,090 --> 04:38:05,050
I was going to say...

7305
04:38:06,170 --> 04:38:06,970
I could...

7306
04:38:06,970 --> 04:38:08,690
Guys, I don't have a res beacon.

7307
04:38:08,830 --> 04:38:09,470
Like, what was I...

7308
04:38:09,470 --> 04:38:10,410
What am I supposed to do?

7309
04:38:12,610 --> 04:38:15,090
What am I supposed to do with no res beacon, guys?

7310
04:38:17,390 --> 04:38:19,030
We have no res beacon.

7311
04:38:19,290 --> 04:38:19,570
There's...

7312
04:38:19,570 --> 04:38:21,050
There's nothing we can do.

7313
04:38:24,010 --> 04:38:24,990
See, look.

7314
04:38:25,190 --> 04:38:26,210
He's a team player.

7315
04:38:26,210 --> 04:38:26,830
I'm not.

7316
04:38:27,470 --> 04:38:29,130
That's just the way...

7317
04:38:29,130 --> 04:38:30,350
The cookie crumbles.

7318
04:38:33,860 --> 04:38:35,980
How is there still five squads?

7319
04:38:37,540 --> 04:38:38,620
It gets...

7320
04:38:38,820 --> 04:38:39,160
Shh.

7321
04:38:39,300 --> 04:38:39,720
I...

7322
04:38:39,720 --> 04:38:40,680
I can't, guys.

7323
04:38:40,980 --> 04:38:41,240
I...

7324
04:38:41,240 --> 04:38:43,380
There was just no other options, guys.

7325
04:38:43,960 --> 04:38:44,160
Shh.

7326
04:38:46,020 --> 04:38:47,340
There was just...

7327
04:38:47,340 --> 04:38:47,860
Shh.

7328
04:38:47,900 --> 04:38:49,600
There was no other option.

7329
04:38:50,220 --> 04:38:51,300
No, no, no.

7330
04:38:51,420 --> 04:38:52,300
I don't know what you're talking...

7331
04:38:52,300 --> 04:38:54,000
I'm giving a res beacon?

7332
04:38:54,460 --> 04:38:56,540
I don't know what you're talking about.

7333
04:38:56,540 --> 04:38:56,780
The...

7334
04:38:56,780 --> 04:38:57,980
I was just...

7335
04:38:57,980 --> 04:38:58,960
My hands were tied.

7336
04:39:10,270 --> 04:39:11,910
Okay, am I gonna do something crazy?

7337
04:39:20,280 --> 04:39:20,800
Yeah.

7338
04:39:24,480 --> 04:39:25,480
I was...

7339
04:39:43,080 --> 04:39:44,160
He's gonna full heal.

7340
04:39:44,440 --> 04:39:45,200
Oh, my God.

7341
04:39:45,940 --> 04:39:46,740
The ego.

7342
04:39:48,840 --> 04:39:50,040
Oh, my God.

7343
04:39:50,180 --> 04:39:51,000
The ego push.

7344
04:39:52,960 --> 04:39:53,960
Oh, my God.

7345
04:39:54,100 --> 04:39:55,280
No, not the ego push.

7346
04:40:20,920 --> 04:40:21,680
Oh, my God.

7347
04:40:21,760 --> 04:40:22,520
Where?!

7348
04:40:26,860 --> 04:40:27,620
Stop!

7349
04:40:27,860 --> 04:40:28,080
Stop!

7350
04:40:36,650 --> 04:40:38,570
Oh, my God.

7351
04:41:05,340 --> 04:41:06,840
My hands are shaking.

7352
04:41:08,400 --> 04:41:11,760
Oh, my God.

7353
04:41:11,780 --> 04:41:11,840
Oh, my God, my hands are shaking.

7354
04:41:11,840 --> 04:41:12,680
How?

7355
04:41:18,070 --> 04:41:19,370
Oh my god.

7356
04:41:19,890 --> 04:41:21,310
Oh my god.

7357
04:41:26,010 --> 04:41:27,810
Oh my god.

7358
04:41:28,530 --> 04:41:29,490
He's dead!

7359
04:41:34,130 --> 04:41:34,770
Please.

7360
04:41:35,050 --> 04:41:35,610
Oh my god.

7361
04:41:35,790 --> 04:41:36,610
Please for the love.

7362
04:41:38,310 --> 04:41:39,690
Is it all solos?

7363
04:41:39,910 --> 04:41:40,910
No, it's not.

7364
04:41:41,170 --> 04:41:42,250
No, it's not.

7365
04:41:42,530 --> 04:41:44,250
No, it's not all solos.

7366
04:41:48,610 --> 04:41:49,250
No.

7367
04:41:53,070 --> 04:41:53,630
No.

7368
04:41:53,630 --> 04:41:54,190
No.

7369
04:41:54,690 --> 04:41:55,090
No.

7370
04:41:57,170 --> 04:41:57,730
No.

7371
04:41:57,950 --> 04:41:57,950
No.

7372
04:41:59,870 --> 04:42:02,010
Wait, why are you in my lobby?

7373
04:42:03,690 --> 04:42:04,910
Oh my god.

7374
04:42:05,570 --> 04:42:06,470
Oh god.

7375
04:42:06,850 --> 04:42:07,230
It's okay.

7376
04:42:07,450 --> 04:42:07,850
I'm fine.

7377
04:42:07,970 --> 04:42:08,630
I'm sad.

7378
04:42:08,790 --> 04:42:09,370
Wait, no.

7379
04:42:09,590 --> 04:42:10,010
Not.

7380
04:42:10,270 --> 04:42:11,110
I need a win.

7381
04:42:11,110 --> 04:42:11,110
I need a win.

7382
04:42:12,550 --> 04:42:17,450
I'm not.

7383
04:42:17,870 --> 04:42:19,890
Also, why are they in my lobby?

7384
04:42:20,070 --> 04:42:20,890
I have an excuse.

7385
04:42:21,070 --> 04:42:22,250
I haven't played in a while.

7386
04:42:26,350 --> 04:42:27,610
Oh my god.

7387
04:42:28,030 --> 04:42:30,250
Okay, this is an actual silver bronze player.

7388
04:42:32,310 --> 04:42:33,710
I'm not satisfied.

7389
04:42:33,870 --> 04:42:34,750
I need a win.

7390
04:42:34,750 --> 04:42:34,750
I need a win.

7391
04:42:35,010 --> 04:42:36,490
I need a win.

7392
04:42:36,490 --> 04:42:36,670
I need a win.

7393
04:42:39,770 --> 04:42:41,330
I did my part.

7394
04:42:41,530 --> 04:42:42,010
I did.

7395
04:42:42,150 --> 04:42:43,290
I did my part.

7396
04:42:43,470 --> 04:42:44,790
I was only 200 damage less.

7397
04:42:45,070 --> 04:42:46,290
I did my part.

7398
04:42:46,750 --> 04:42:51,130
I always did DJs.

7399
04:42:53,130 --> 04:42:55,590
Oh my god.

7400
04:42:55,950 --> 04:42:57,930
You did amazing.

7401
04:42:57,930 --> 04:42:58,410
Amazing.

7402
04:43:01,090 --> 04:43:04,070
I did my part of the bargain.

7403
04:43:04,450 --> 04:43:05,790
I did my part of the bargain.

7404
04:43:07,770 --> 04:43:09,090
We did carry.

7405
04:43:09,410 --> 04:43:11,710
We did equal amounts of damage.

7406
04:43:12,170 --> 04:43:13,030
And he insed.

7407
04:43:13,490 --> 04:43:17,050
I 1v4 just then after he died.

7408
04:43:17,450 --> 04:43:18,770
Did he 1v4?

7409
04:43:18,990 --> 04:43:21,010
No, No, he 1v2'd.

7410
04:43:23,090 --> 04:43:24,770
I 1v4'd.

7411
04:43:24,930 --> 04:43:26,110
I had two more and more.

7412
04:43:26,470 --> 04:43:27,990
I need to refill my water.

7413
04:43:28,150 --> 04:43:28,670
Give me a sec.

7414
04:43:43,970 --> 04:43:45,030
He also talked.

7415
04:43:45,310 --> 04:43:46,850
I said no talking.

7416
04:43:49,430 --> 04:43:51,010
Daddy needs to focus.

7417
04:43:57,970 --> 04:43:59,630
I need to focus.

7418
04:44:10,140 --> 04:44:12,180
He says no talking.

7419
04:44:14,300 --> 04:44:15,680
Are you a little tired?

7420
04:44:15,960 --> 04:44:16,420
I am.

7421
04:44:16,580 --> 04:44:16,880
I am.

7422
04:44:17,100 --> 04:44:18,180
I have 3 hours of sleep.

7423
04:44:18,780 --> 04:44:20,140
Before the early access.

7424
04:44:21,360 --> 04:44:22,600
Wait, let me...

7425
04:44:24,460 --> 04:44:25,780
I'm sorry.

7426
04:44:26,080 --> 04:44:26,800
I'm...

7427
04:44:27,820 --> 04:44:30,820
I had 3 hours of sleep.

7428
04:44:32,120 --> 04:44:33,660
There we go.

7429
04:44:35,900 --> 04:44:37,780
That should be...

7430
04:44:37,780 --> 04:44:39,560
Then people will know.

7431
04:44:49,670 --> 04:44:52,770
Now people will know why I'm like this today.

7432
04:44:57,910 --> 04:44:58,890
Alright.

7433
04:45:00,510 --> 04:45:01,490
It's okay.

7434
04:45:05,770 --> 04:45:07,110
It's fine.

7435
04:45:08,170 --> 04:45:09,150
I'm okay.

7436
04:45:12,290 --> 04:45:14,690
Too angry to sleep.

7437
04:45:16,250 --> 04:45:18,210
Dude, know why now.

7438
04:45:20,230 --> 04:45:21,170
Oh my god.

7439
04:45:21,290 --> 04:45:22,390
No, that's not an R9.

7440
04:45:24,650 --> 04:45:26,070
That's not an R9.

7441
04:45:27,610 --> 04:45:29,930
What do I do when it's not an R9?

7442
04:45:33,660 --> 04:45:34,560
Wait a minute.

7443
04:45:44,400 --> 04:45:44,860
What?

7444
04:45:45,500 --> 04:45:47,240
How did he know I was looking?

7445
04:45:48,060 --> 04:45:48,200
Dude.

7446
04:45:49,030 --> 04:45:51,560
That's crazy that he knew I was looking.

7447
04:45:55,230 --> 04:45:57,630
I wasn't there anymore, you fucking idiot.

7448
04:46:00,290 --> 04:46:01,190
That's fine.

7449
04:46:01,730 --> 04:46:03,050
That's not fine though.

7450
04:46:07,800 --> 04:46:08,770
Guys, I need help.

7451
04:46:17,070 --> 04:46:17,550
No!

7452
04:46:17,630 --> 04:46:18,090
I...

7453
04:46:18,090 --> 04:46:18,410
No!

7454
04:46:18,630 --> 04:46:19,530
The other gun!

7455
04:46:19,770 --> 04:46:20,310
Oh my god.

7456
04:46:20,390 --> 04:46:21,390
I swapped to the other gun.

7457
04:46:21,790 --> 04:46:22,790
Oh, that's bad.

7458
04:46:23,430 --> 04:46:25,230
I swapped to the other gun accidentally.

7459
04:46:25,950 --> 04:46:26,930
That was unfortunate.

7460
04:46:28,830 --> 04:46:29,610
Oh, okay.

7461
04:46:30,790 --> 04:46:31,270
Anger.

7462
04:46:37,340 --> 04:46:37,820
Anger.

7463
04:46:37,820 --> 04:46:37,840
Anger.

7464
04:47:00,280 --> 04:47:00,900
No!

7465
04:47:01,780 --> 04:47:03,680
It's so low!

7466
04:47:05,800 --> 04:47:07,040
Yay!

7467
04:47:08,980 --> 04:47:10,540
No more anger.

7468
04:47:11,140 --> 04:47:12,060
Calm.

7469
04:47:16,080 --> 04:47:17,320
Calm.

7470
04:47:19,780 --> 04:47:21,780
Anger no more.

7471
04:47:23,880 --> 04:47:24,560
Anger.

7472
04:47:24,560 --> 04:47:25,840
Anger has dispersed.

7473
04:47:26,700 --> 04:47:29,780
I clearly got ran at by three people.

7474
04:47:29,920 --> 04:47:31,300
What the fuck was wrong with them?

7475
04:47:32,700 --> 04:47:33,900
Oh my god.

7476
04:47:34,120 --> 04:47:35,480
It's been a while.

7477
04:47:36,980 --> 04:47:37,660
Calm.

7478
04:47:43,680 --> 04:47:45,880
We'll keep this load up for now.

7479
04:47:47,560 --> 04:47:48,760
Anger gone.

7480
04:47:49,640 --> 04:47:51,260
Doki satisfied.

7481
04:47:55,600 --> 04:47:56,680
Alright, I res.

7482
04:47:57,620 --> 04:47:58,720
Doki res.

7483
04:48:02,500 --> 04:48:08,200
I might be a little angry that they won't try to run at me.

7484
04:48:08,420 --> 04:48:09,080
1v3.

7485
04:48:09,900 --> 04:48:12,040
Might be a little angry.

7486
04:48:12,040 --> 04:48:12,120
1v3.

7487
04:48:15,040 --> 04:48:18,660
And I cracked all three of them, like, four fucking times.

7488
04:48:18,700 --> 04:48:19,620
But it's okay.

7489
04:48:19,960 --> 04:48:21,560
Sometimes life is like that.

7490
04:48:28,830 --> 04:48:29,350
Alright.

7491
04:48:29,590 --> 04:48:30,250
Let's see.

7492
04:48:32,650 --> 04:48:33,530
Oh my god.

7493
04:48:33,650 --> 04:48:34,990
What the fuck is the R9?

7494
04:48:35,570 --> 04:48:37,030
They can't do this to me.

7495
04:48:38,170 --> 04:48:39,750
I deserve an R9.

7496
04:48:43,190 --> 04:48:44,260
Okay, I'm gonna...

7497
04:48:45,150 --> 04:48:45,650
Open.

7498
04:48:45,850 --> 04:48:46,530
Open crate.

7499
04:48:50,670 --> 04:48:51,950
Oh, where's the crate?

7500
04:48:52,150 --> 04:48:53,030
Where's the big crate?

7501
04:48:55,070 --> 04:48:57,090
Where's the nice big crate?

7502
04:48:58,890 --> 04:48:59,790
Where is it?

7503
04:48:59,930 --> 04:49:00,510
Is it up here?

7504
04:49:01,090 --> 04:49:02,250
How do you get up here?

7505
04:49:02,970 --> 04:49:04,270
You see that red thing?

7506
04:49:04,270 --> 04:49:05,610
What the fuck?

7507
04:49:05,750 --> 04:49:06,330
Where is it?

7508
04:49:08,070 --> 04:49:10,370
How do you...

7509
04:49:10,940 --> 04:49:11,430
Where?

7510
04:49:13,050 --> 04:49:13,990
Where?

7511
04:49:14,870 --> 04:49:16,610
I don't understand.

7512
04:49:16,610 --> 04:49:17,470
I'm tired.

7513
04:49:17,870 --> 04:49:18,690
I'm not.

7514
04:49:20,230 --> 04:49:22,150
I don't understand.

7515
04:49:22,800 --> 04:49:23,870
I've given up.

7516
04:49:26,070 --> 04:49:27,050
Hello?

7517
04:49:31,870 --> 04:49:32,940
If he...

7518
04:49:32,940 --> 04:49:33,780
No.

7519
04:49:35,940 --> 04:49:37,740
He's not getting that.

7520
04:49:37,980 --> 04:49:39,080
I refuse.

7521
04:49:42,620 --> 04:49:43,320
Over there.

7522
04:49:48,660 --> 04:49:49,060
Alright.

7523
04:49:50,640 --> 04:49:51,340
We go.

7524
04:49:52,560 --> 04:49:53,860
It is our destiny.

7525
04:49:57,790 --> 04:49:59,990
I'm running on fumes.

7526
04:50:00,310 --> 04:50:00,950
Wait, is that R9?

7527
04:50:02,650 --> 04:50:03,510
Oh my god.

7528
04:50:04,670 --> 04:50:06,290
There is a god.

7529
04:50:06,750 --> 04:50:07,110
There is a god.

7530
04:50:07,450 --> 04:50:07,790
Why?

7531
04:50:09,210 --> 04:50:09,690
Why?

7532
04:50:11,050 --> 04:50:13,750
Why are you running in the open?

7533
04:50:16,450 --> 04:50:17,970
Oh my god.

7534
04:50:20,150 --> 04:50:20,630
Okay.

7535
04:50:21,290 --> 04:50:24,310
My teammate decided to run in the open.

7536
04:50:26,010 --> 04:50:27,890
And now I have to...

7537
04:50:27,890 --> 04:50:28,890
Do this.

7538
04:50:29,290 --> 04:50:30,370
And now I have to do this.

7539
04:50:32,090 --> 04:50:33,130
And hope...

7540
04:50:33,130 --> 04:50:33,490
My...

7541
04:50:33,490 --> 04:50:34,470
Wait, is that two teams?

7542
04:50:34,710 --> 04:50:35,750
Wait, this is...

7543
04:50:35,750 --> 04:50:36,890
Is that two teams?

7544
04:50:37,190 --> 04:50:37,710
Wait.

7545
04:50:38,730 --> 04:50:39,990
Wait a minute.

7546
04:50:40,550 --> 04:50:41,770
This is two teams, right?

7547
04:50:42,430 --> 04:50:43,750
Why else would they have a cross?

7548
04:50:48,490 --> 04:50:49,010
Man.

7549
04:50:52,450 --> 04:50:53,710
No, they just...

7550
04:50:53,710 --> 04:50:54,610
Actually, no it's not.

7551
04:50:57,170 --> 04:50:58,330
Wait, no it is.

7552
04:50:58,910 --> 04:50:59,730
Wait, it is.

7553
04:51:00,590 --> 04:51:01,610
Two team, why?

7554
04:51:03,190 --> 04:51:03,710
Why?

7555
04:51:06,450 --> 04:51:07,430
Play for team?

7556
04:51:07,710 --> 04:51:08,310
Let's try.

7557
04:51:09,190 --> 04:51:09,770
You know what?

7558
04:51:09,970 --> 04:51:12,350
The one time I decided to be a good person.

7559
04:51:19,880 --> 04:51:21,780
God, I wish I had a scope.

7560
04:51:22,550 --> 04:51:23,320
Scope moments.

7561
04:51:25,040 --> 04:51:26,360
Two team, why?

7562
04:51:26,780 --> 04:51:27,700
I'm not...

7563
04:51:31,560 --> 04:51:32,500
Nice, okay.

7564
04:51:35,160 --> 04:51:36,840
I wish I had a scope though.

7565
04:51:44,360 --> 04:51:44,980
Jesus.

7566
04:51:45,800 --> 04:51:46,520
Above us.

7567
04:51:48,030 --> 04:51:48,340
What?

7568
04:51:48,860 --> 04:51:49,900
Gomez, no!

7569
04:51:51,580 --> 04:51:53,020
How do you get up?

7570
04:51:56,200 --> 04:51:57,320
I don't know how to get up.

7571
04:52:01,010 --> 04:52:02,130
Guard me, guard me, guard me.

7572
04:52:02,250 --> 04:52:02,890
Shield, shield, shield.

7573
04:52:16,760 --> 04:52:17,480
Jesus Christ.

7574
04:52:17,720 --> 04:52:19,180
I don't know how to...

7575
04:52:19,180 --> 04:52:19,480
Get up.

7576
04:52:23,400 --> 04:52:24,360
Oh, I should...

7577
04:52:24,360 --> 04:52:25,120
Fucking, okay, there you go.

7578
04:52:30,630 --> 04:52:32,090
What's going on?

7579
04:52:32,750 --> 04:52:33,910
What the fuck?

7580
04:52:44,870 --> 04:52:45,230
Wait!

7581
04:52:53,290 --> 04:52:53,970
Wait, okay.

7582
04:52:54,150 --> 04:52:54,910
Also, controller?

7583
04:52:55,130 --> 04:52:55,470
Controller?

7584
04:52:57,670 --> 04:52:58,150
Controller?

7585
04:52:58,350 --> 04:52:58,430
Controller?

7586
04:52:58,430 --> 04:52:58,490
Okay.

7587
04:52:58,930 --> 04:52:59,250
I...

7588
04:53:06,080 --> 04:53:07,500
I won't say much.

7589
04:53:16,340 --> 04:53:18,180
I'm just gonna have this on the screen.

7590
04:53:18,890 --> 04:53:19,280
I'm...

7591
04:53:20,180 --> 04:53:21,260
I'm just...

7592
04:53:22,150 --> 04:53:23,560
I'm gonna have...

7593
04:53:23,850 --> 04:53:25,300
I'm gonna have this on the screen.

7594
04:53:26,910 --> 04:53:27,740
Just for now.

7595
04:53:28,840 --> 04:53:31,200
I embrace the YouTube.

7596
04:53:33,780 --> 04:53:36,100
If I speak, I am in trouble.

7597
04:53:36,420 --> 04:53:37,500
I shall not speak.

7598
04:53:38,160 --> 04:53:39,580
I shall...

7599
04:53:39,810 --> 04:53:42,260
Let the stacks speak for themselves.

7600
04:53:43,020 --> 04:53:44,920
One player is signed...

7601
04:53:44,920 --> 04:53:46,460
To one of the best teams...

7602
04:53:47,140 --> 04:53:48,280
In pro play.

7603
04:53:48,980 --> 04:53:50,260
The other person...

7604
04:53:51,080 --> 04:53:51,840
Plays...

7605
04:53:53,020 --> 04:53:54,020
Plays for fun.

7606
04:53:54,860 --> 04:53:55,920
Which one is it?

7607
04:54:02,120 --> 04:54:03,520
Wait, really?

7608
04:54:04,060 --> 04:54:05,360
Cuban is signed?

7609
04:54:05,920 --> 04:54:07,040
Oh my god!

7610
04:54:07,040 --> 04:54:07,080
Guys!

7611
04:54:13,920 --> 04:54:16,760
Both players play Marvel Rivals!

7612
04:54:16,980 --> 04:54:18,500
You can't say that!

7613
04:54:19,080 --> 04:54:21,240
Both players play Marvel Rivals!

7614
04:54:25,580 --> 04:54:27,320
Bottom of the curve.

7615
04:54:29,680 --> 04:54:34,520
A person that works hard could never beat a person who is having fun.

7616
04:54:39,270 --> 04:54:40,130
It's fine.

7617
04:54:40,870 --> 04:54:41,490
It's fine.

7618
04:54:41,490 --> 04:54:41,930
This is it.

7619
04:54:42,230 --> 04:54:43,090
This is the game.

7620
04:54:48,890 --> 04:54:52,310
I shall push the rock on top of the mountain!

7621
04:54:52,970 --> 04:54:54,850
I can see it now!

7622
04:54:56,030 --> 04:54:59,490
The rock will be on top of that mountain!

7623
04:55:03,170 --> 04:55:05,950
The rock will be there!

7624
04:55:06,570 --> 04:55:06,670
The rock will be there!

7625
04:55:06,670 --> 04:55:08,350
I can see it!

7626
04:55:08,510 --> 04:55:09,850
In my vision!

7627
04:55:10,950 --> 04:55:13,230
Why are you here, Kazumi?

7628
04:55:16,950 --> 04:55:20,070
I can't believe we are still going.

7629
04:55:21,670 --> 04:55:26,770
After seeing that bell curve for like three hours straight, like...

7630
04:55:26,770 --> 04:55:29,010
You know why.

7631
04:55:30,590 --> 04:55:32,510
I saw that bell curve.

7632
04:55:38,920 --> 04:55:40,640
It never went up.

7633
04:55:42,440 --> 04:55:46,160
It only went up when I lost the third person.

7634
04:55:46,600 --> 04:55:48,620
That was how fucked up it was.

7635
04:55:48,900 --> 04:55:53,480
The fact that the bell curve only went up when my third player was gone.

7636
04:55:53,600 --> 04:55:56,820
Was when I knew things were not what it seems.

7637
04:55:57,640 --> 04:55:58,580
There's people over here.

7638
04:55:58,580 --> 04:56:00,400
The way in the distance.

7639
04:56:02,260 --> 04:56:03,620
The 20, 20 here.

7640
04:56:19,610 --> 04:56:20,170
Okay.

7641
04:56:22,870 --> 04:56:23,430
Nice.

7642
04:56:25,090 --> 04:56:26,310
Wait, what the fuck...

7643
04:56:27,810 --> 04:56:28,790
Oh my...

7644
04:56:28,790 --> 04:56:30,110
God, he has an R9-2!

7645
04:56:30,110 --> 04:56:30,110
You?

7646
04:56:32,430 --> 04:56:34,530
Again i have to hell-marry this shot.

7647
04:56:36,290 --> 04:56:38,430
Unless... i mean one is down, so.

7648
04:56:41,190 --> 04:56:42,830
Nice... he is gonna heal then.

7649
04:56:43,650 --> 04:56:44,350
that's the new team.

7650
04:56:44,430 --> 04:56:45,470
that's the new team.

7651
04:56:45,830 --> 04:56:46,730
I'm full of healing.

7652
04:56:47,290 --> 04:56:48,390
i'm full healing.

7653
04:56:52,070 --> 04:56:53,890
i'm full of healing, thats a new team.

7654
04:56:56,490 --> 04:56:57,790
Okay, I'm coming to help him.

7655
04:57:07,010 --> 04:57:08,130
Jesus Christ.

7656
04:57:09,450 --> 04:57:12,490
I'm trying to make sure, like, I'm not getting flanked at all.

7657
04:57:14,510 --> 04:57:15,990
Okay, I'm locking in a little.

7658
04:57:17,610 --> 04:57:17,850
Oh!

7659
04:57:19,890 --> 04:57:22,830
How are you still trying to kill me?!

7660
04:57:22,830 --> 04:57:26,830
Oh

7661
04:57:36,070 --> 04:57:36,530
my god.

7662
04:57:38,850 --> 04:57:39,610
Where it is?

7663
04:57:43,330 --> 04:57:44,090
How?

7664
04:57:44,270 --> 04:57:46,430
When did bronze become like this?

7665
04:57:46,670 --> 04:57:57,860
I... There's no... I'm fucking... I'm going in.

7666
04:57:58,120 --> 04:57:59,200
I'm going in.

7667
04:58:03,710 --> 04:58:05,090
Jesus Christ.

7668
04:58:08,190 --> 04:58:10,430
This is some bronze?!

7669
04:58:20,010 --> 04:58:22,030
I'm coming back right now.

7670
04:58:25,510 --> 04:58:26,610
I believe.

7671
04:58:27,170 --> 04:58:28,610
I believe.

7672
04:58:31,790 --> 04:58:35,010
I don't understand how bronze became like this.

7673
04:58:36,950 --> 04:58:39,170
This is actual.

7674
04:58:41,010 --> 04:58:42,390
This is hell.

7675
04:58:47,290 --> 04:58:48,790
No, I can't do it.

7676
04:58:49,170 --> 04:58:50,330
Alright, I'm coming.

7677
04:58:50,470 --> 04:58:51,190
I'm going up.

7678
04:58:51,790 --> 04:58:57,110
I... We don't get any... I hear footsteps.

7679
04:58:58,110 --> 04:59:07,580
The fact that I had to, like, look at 20 different people that entire fight... Over here.

7680
04:59:08,560 --> 04:59:08,920
Oh.

7681
04:59:11,480 --> 04:59:12,080
Wait.

7682
04:59:12,640 --> 04:59:14,200
You get shot by a different team?

7683
04:59:22,380 --> 04:59:23,080
Wait, no.

7684
04:59:23,260 --> 04:59:24,240
That's a third party.

7685
04:59:24,820 --> 04:59:28,640
That's a... That's a... That's unlucky.

7686
04:59:28,920 --> 04:59:30,120
I was like, wait a minute.

7687
04:59:30,420 --> 04:59:31,360
That's another team.

7688
04:59:37,280 --> 04:59:38,400
I have the bat.

7689
04:59:40,100 --> 04:59:41,340
Jesus Christ.

7690
04:59:44,220 --> 04:59:45,140
Oh, hey, good.

7691
04:59:48,180 --> 04:59:49,220
Oh, my god.

7692
04:59:49,360 --> 04:59:50,740
I don't have any bats left.

7693
04:59:51,640 --> 04:59:54,240
There's no way we're in bronze-silver lobbies now.

7694
04:59:54,500 --> 04:59:56,220
I... I refuse to believe that.

7695
05:00:12,470 --> 05:00:14,190
No, I'm gonna get... Oh, my god.

7696
05:00:15,130 --> 05:00:16,870
I swear to god.

7697
05:00:17,150 --> 05:00:18,210
Oh, my god.

7698
05:00:18,690 --> 05:00:19,790
I'm gonna go.

7699
05:00:20,110 --> 05:00:21,230
And there's another team!

7700
05:00:21,610 --> 05:00:22,830
Oh, my god.

7701
05:00:23,050 --> 05:00:24,130
That's another team!

7702
05:00:24,570 --> 05:00:26,110
Just... Just... Oh, my god.

7703
05:00:26,330 --> 05:00:27,990
That's... That's another team.

7704
05:00:27,990 --> 05:00:39,310
I... Oh, my god.

7705
05:00:39,550 --> 05:00:41,970
That's... That's another team.

7706
05:00:43,770 --> 05:00:48,270
I... That's... Okay.

7707
05:00:49,270 --> 05:00:49,790
You're fine.

7708
05:00:50,090 --> 05:00:50,250
Alright.

7709
05:00:50,370 --> 05:00:50,790
There we go.

7710
05:00:51,030 --> 05:00:51,810
There we go.

7711
05:00:52,150 --> 05:00:54,130
The ride never ends.

7712
05:00:54,130 --> 05:00:56,450
My circuits are connecting again.

7713
05:00:56,810 --> 05:00:57,170
Okay.

7714
05:00:57,570 --> 05:00:58,170
I'm okay.

7715
05:01:00,610 --> 05:01:01,690
I'm okay.

7716
05:01:02,230 --> 05:01:03,710
I... We just had...

7717
05:01:03,710 --> 05:01:05,010
A lot of teams.

7718
05:01:05,370 --> 05:01:09,490
We just had... A lot... A lot of teams.

7719
05:01:09,870 --> 05:01:10,390
Wait, what?

7720
05:01:11,790 --> 05:01:13,010
Oh, my god.

7721
05:01:13,190 --> 05:01:14,010
They rezzed.

7722
05:01:14,430 --> 05:01:15,710
They... They rezzed.

7723
05:01:15,910 --> 05:01:17,850
They actually... They rezzed.

7724
05:01:23,030 --> 05:01:25,430
I'm gonna do something really fucking dumb.

7725
05:01:35,850 --> 05:01:36,890
It worked.

7726
05:01:38,050 --> 05:01:39,250
It worked.

7727
05:01:39,510 --> 05:01:40,350
I'm dumb.

7728
05:01:56,250 --> 05:01:59,290
I swear... I... I will punch you!

7729
05:01:59,450 --> 05:02:00,070
I know!

7730
05:02:00,230 --> 05:02:01,230
He got the punch now!

7731
05:02:03,470 --> 05:02:04,690
I forgot.

7732
05:02:05,090 --> 05:02:06,830
The punches don't auto anymore.

7733
05:02:07,490 --> 05:02:08,670
Punches don't auto.

7734
05:02:08,870 --> 05:02:11,250
I'm just... Oh, my god.

7735
05:02:11,590 --> 05:02:14,150
I need to remember punches don't auto anymore.

7736
05:02:14,850 --> 05:02:16,930
I... I can't!

7737
05:02:19,170 --> 05:02:20,570
I can't!

7738
05:02:20,770 --> 05:02:20,950
I can't!

7739
05:02:20,950 --> 05:02:21,830
Oh, my god.

7740
05:02:24,570 --> 05:02:27,650
I need... I can't.

7741
05:02:27,650 --> 05:02:28,850
Let's go over there!

7742
05:02:29,610 --> 05:02:30,970
Oh, my god.

7743
05:02:31,350 --> 05:02:32,910
I need to... I threw that.

7744
05:02:33,230 --> 05:02:34,370
I... I crashed out.

7745
05:02:34,470 --> 05:02:34,950
I'm sorry.

7746
05:02:35,590 --> 05:02:37,550
I crashed out with my... I crashed.

7747
05:02:38,010 --> 05:02:38,770
She's out.

7748
05:02:38,930 --> 05:02:39,950
She's out.

7749
05:02:40,330 --> 05:02:43,870
I... I... The one time I fully crashed out...

7750
05:02:46,150 --> 05:02:49,930
It just... This assist no longer works.

7751
05:02:50,570 --> 05:02:55,290
Bro, I... There was no breaks that entire fight.

7752
05:03:00,710 --> 05:03:02,090
That was my bad.

7753
05:03:02,290 --> 05:03:04,730
I take full blame for that.

7754
05:03:04,950 --> 05:03:07,330
I crashed out during that.

7755
05:03:07,770 --> 05:03:08,970
I take full blame.

7756
05:03:09,270 --> 05:03:13,930
If I didn't spend my time fucking trying to punch that guy instead of reloading my gun.

7757
05:03:18,690 --> 05:03:19,710
No, it's okay.

7758
05:03:19,890 --> 05:03:20,330
I'm okay.

7759
05:03:20,550 --> 05:03:21,010
I'm okay.

7760
05:03:22,270 --> 05:03:23,370
Oh my god.

7761
05:03:25,310 --> 05:03:27,930
I threw that fight really hard.

7762
05:03:28,230 --> 05:03:30,770
I could have killed her and then we would have been able to reset.

7763
05:03:30,990 --> 05:03:34,930
But I let my personal hate get the best of me.

7764
05:03:35,670 --> 05:03:38,110
I let my hate control me there.

7765
05:03:38,310 --> 05:03:40,070
I won't do that again.

7766
05:03:46,360 --> 05:03:50,140
No, the last lobby we had was supposed to be a bronze-silver lobby.

7767
05:03:50,380 --> 05:03:52,900
That did not feel like a bronze-silver lobby.

7768
05:03:53,000 --> 05:03:53,620
I'm sorry.

7769
05:03:53,620 --> 05:03:55,540
That did not...

7770
05:03:57,820 --> 05:04:00,660
That did not feel like bronze-silver.

7771
05:04:02,800 --> 05:04:05,600
I got... Yeah, I went to the dark side.

7772
05:04:06,160 --> 05:04:11,600
I got... My dark... My intrusive thoughts got the better of me.

7773
05:04:14,140 --> 05:04:15,900
I went to the dark side.

7774
05:04:19,320 --> 05:04:21,380
No, I'm not in early access anymore.

7775
05:04:21,380 --> 05:04:22,940
I'm doing like normal games.

7776
05:04:27,900 --> 05:04:30,560
I'm... I'm doing normal ranked games.

7777
05:04:30,680 --> 05:04:32,940
Cause like... Early access was like...

7778
05:04:33,860 --> 05:04:34,960
It was something.

7779
05:04:41,930 --> 05:04:42,490
Alright.

7780
05:04:43,230 --> 05:04:47,190
Yeah, I was like... These did not feel like the games I played at 3 in the morning.

7781
05:04:49,590 --> 05:04:53,570
The games I played at 3 in the morning was so relaxed.

7782
05:05:00,180 --> 05:05:01,260
You know what?

7783
05:05:01,460 --> 05:05:03,360
I just feel a little inspired.

7784
05:05:08,850 --> 05:05:09,570
Yeah.

7785
05:05:11,810 --> 05:05:13,510
Alright, who's shooting?

7786
05:05:15,170 --> 05:05:16,670
No, that's what I'm saying.

7787
05:05:16,870 --> 05:05:18,090
I'm not relaxed.

7788
05:05:20,930 --> 05:05:21,650
Oh.

7789
05:05:23,070 --> 05:05:24,150
I haven't...

7790
05:05:24,150 --> 05:05:24,610
Oh.

7791
05:05:25,270 --> 05:05:27,210
I hit players in smoke?

7792
05:05:27,670 --> 05:05:27,990
Haha.

7793
05:05:28,970 --> 05:05:30,550
But not...

7794
05:05:31,150 --> 05:05:33,110
Not when they're like, right there?

7795
05:05:34,490 --> 05:05:35,330
Jesus.

7796
05:05:38,250 --> 05:05:39,930
Oh, that's...

7797
05:05:41,250 --> 05:05:42,330
Oh, no.

7798
05:05:45,450 --> 05:05:46,690
Okay, fuck it.

7799
05:05:46,810 --> 05:05:46,890
Oh.

7800
05:05:46,890 --> 05:05:46,930
Oh.

7801
05:05:47,870 --> 05:05:48,550
Oh.

7802
05:05:48,950 --> 05:05:49,570
Fine.

7803
05:05:49,810 --> 05:05:50,390
I got this.

7804
05:05:51,770 --> 05:05:52,450
Alright.

7805
05:05:52,670 --> 05:05:53,250
Full focus.

7806
05:05:53,790 --> 05:05:54,650
Full focus.

7807
05:06:01,110 --> 05:06:03,490
I don't have a shield for you, so don't...

7808
05:06:04,110 --> 05:06:04,450
What?

7809
05:06:07,890 --> 05:06:08,570
Hello.

7810
05:06:14,940 --> 05:06:15,280
Okay.

7811
05:06:18,300 --> 05:06:20,500
I don't know where they are.

7812
05:06:24,960 --> 05:06:25,780
Am I kidding me?

7813
05:06:25,840 --> 05:06:26,540
Give me my...

7814
05:06:26,540 --> 05:06:26,560
Give me my...

7815
05:06:26,560 --> 05:06:27,040
Oh, my God.

7816
05:06:31,850 --> 05:06:32,570
There we go.

7817
05:06:38,010 --> 05:06:38,410
Jesus.

7818
05:06:39,130 --> 05:06:40,110
Oh, my God.

7819
05:06:43,920 --> 05:06:44,320
Jesus.

7820
05:06:45,060 --> 05:06:46,700
They are not getting back off from that.

7821
05:06:46,920 --> 05:06:47,320
Okay.

7822
05:06:50,240 --> 05:06:50,760
That's fine.

7823
05:06:50,940 --> 05:06:51,400
He can't shoot.

7824
05:06:52,640 --> 05:06:53,040
Jesus.

7825
05:06:54,400 --> 05:06:56,360
I was gonna be like, please.

7826
05:06:56,360 --> 05:06:56,440
Please.

7827
05:06:58,860 --> 05:06:59,460
Wait.

7828
05:06:59,580 --> 05:07:00,400
That seems like two.

7829
05:07:05,490 --> 05:07:06,590
Two or three.

7830
05:07:07,510 --> 05:07:08,170
What's over here?

7831
05:07:08,730 --> 05:07:09,170
One.

7832
05:07:10,130 --> 05:07:10,490
Okay.

7833
05:07:10,590 --> 05:07:10,890
Nice.

7834
05:07:11,510 --> 05:07:11,890
Alright.

7835
05:07:12,530 --> 05:07:15,310
Should have stucked up in this chair.

7836
05:07:17,290 --> 05:07:17,890
Alright.

7837
05:07:18,010 --> 05:07:18,330
Nice.

7838
05:07:18,590 --> 05:07:18,770
Okay.

7839
05:07:19,070 --> 05:07:21,490
I was gonna be like, please, I...

7840
05:07:21,490 --> 05:07:23,830
I need the arm shield.

7841
05:07:24,390 --> 05:07:25,570
I need...

7842
05:07:26,310 --> 05:07:27,270
Wait, I'm not upgraded?

7843
05:07:27,270 --> 05:07:29,630
I need to use my FBs.

7844
05:07:29,770 --> 05:07:31,670
I do that out of habit.

7845
05:07:34,130 --> 05:07:35,350
I need this.

7846
05:07:36,210 --> 05:07:36,770
Okay.

7847
05:07:37,190 --> 05:07:37,370
Fuck.

7848
05:07:37,630 --> 05:07:38,130
I'm okay.

7849
05:07:38,850 --> 05:07:39,730
I don't know why.

7850
05:07:39,850 --> 05:07:40,350
Fuck it.

7851
05:07:40,570 --> 05:07:41,550
It's a triple take day.

7852
05:07:44,330 --> 05:07:46,190
Sometimes I just gotta believe.

7853
05:07:46,930 --> 05:07:49,670
If I start believing, things will go my way.

7854
05:07:53,590 --> 05:07:54,150
Whee!

7855
05:07:54,150 --> 05:07:54,170
Whee!

7856
05:08:01,220 --> 05:08:02,280
I'm okay.

7857
05:08:04,340 --> 05:08:07,880
If I start to believe, things will go my way.

7858
05:08:08,640 --> 05:08:09,180
Whee!

7859
05:08:12,640 --> 05:08:14,560
Who's gonna tell her?

7860
05:08:15,540 --> 05:08:16,700
Tell me what?

7861
05:08:17,360 --> 05:08:19,460
Things are gonna go my way!

7862
05:08:19,460 --> 05:08:19,600
Hey!

7863
05:08:26,380 --> 05:08:28,980
I lied when I said it's a triple take day.

7864
05:08:29,720 --> 05:08:30,600
I lied.

7865
05:08:33,140 --> 05:08:35,320
It's never a triple take day.

7866
05:08:38,970 --> 05:08:40,310
Wait, I wanna grab that shield.

7867
05:08:45,340 --> 05:08:48,120
I wanna grab shield uppy.

7868
05:08:49,560 --> 05:08:51,400
I don't know what it's called anymore.

7869
05:08:51,740 --> 05:08:52,360
My...

7870
05:08:52,360 --> 05:08:53,380
I don't know.

7871
05:08:53,800 --> 05:08:55,100
Yellow shield uppy.

7872
05:08:55,100 --> 05:08:56,100
He he he he he he.

7873
05:08:56,360 --> 05:08:57,540
Our odds keep getting better.

7874
05:08:57,540 --> 05:08:57,560
Our odds keep getting better.

7875
05:09:00,320 --> 05:09:01,000
Yeah.

7876
05:09:03,860 --> 05:09:04,620
Where are we going?

7877
05:09:05,280 --> 05:09:06,320
Oh, follow me.

7878
05:09:07,200 --> 05:09:08,260
I find...

7879
05:09:08,260 --> 05:09:08,820
Evo!

7880
05:09:09,200 --> 05:09:10,300
Evo Cash.

7881
05:09:10,640 --> 05:09:11,180
I remember now.

7882
05:09:12,100 --> 05:09:13,140
Evo Cash.

7883
05:09:15,720 --> 05:09:16,400
Alright.

7884
05:09:19,120 --> 05:09:20,380
I aim.

7885
05:09:21,200 --> 05:09:22,240
Things die.

7886
05:09:23,200 --> 05:09:24,480
That is my lie.

7887
05:09:26,160 --> 05:09:28,060
I am a DPS player.

7888
05:09:28,480 --> 05:09:29,440
In this game.

7889
05:09:31,200 --> 05:09:31,800
Alright.

7890
05:09:32,080 --> 05:09:33,100
We go right side!

7891
05:09:36,620 --> 05:09:37,500
We can...

7892
05:09:37,500 --> 05:09:39,180
I have no attachments on my guns!

7893
05:09:39,700 --> 05:09:40,300
Oh!

7894
05:09:40,580 --> 05:09:41,300
That's bad!

7895
05:09:43,080 --> 05:09:46,060
I think my manager might be mad that I'm still streaming.

7896
05:09:47,200 --> 05:09:47,800
Apex.

7897
05:09:47,800 --> 05:09:48,540
Hahaha.

7898
05:09:50,720 --> 05:09:51,480
Hahaha.

7899
05:09:53,780 --> 05:09:55,300
It was supposed to be done.

7900
05:09:55,480 --> 05:09:56,820
A while ago.

7901
05:09:57,400 --> 05:09:57,500
Hahaha.

7902
05:10:00,740 --> 05:10:00,840
Hahaha.

7903
05:10:02,160 --> 05:10:02,440
Hahaha.

7904
05:10:04,720 --> 05:10:05,480
Sorry!

7905
05:10:05,940 --> 05:10:06,180
Hahaha.

7906
05:10:08,540 --> 05:10:08,920
Whoopsie!

7907
05:10:13,130 --> 05:10:14,610
Whoa, that's aggressive.

7908
05:10:15,830 --> 05:10:17,050
Now they all...

7909
05:10:17,050 --> 05:10:18,130
Now the entire...

7910
05:10:18,130 --> 05:10:19,350
China knows we're here.

7911
05:10:26,120 --> 05:10:27,380
I don't like this.

7912
05:10:28,180 --> 05:10:29,540
Oh my god, I knew it.

7913
05:10:30,160 --> 05:10:32,940
I had that feeling when they took that zip.

7914
05:10:41,200 --> 05:10:42,500
Jesus Christ.

7915
05:10:43,680 --> 05:10:45,200
Can I actually run for me now?

7916
05:10:47,420 --> 05:10:47,960
Fuck.

7917
05:10:48,460 --> 05:10:49,200
No, I knew it.

7918
05:10:49,280 --> 05:10:49,600
I knew it.

7919
05:10:49,740 --> 05:10:49,960
Fuck.

7920
05:10:51,260 --> 05:10:52,320
Are you serious?

7921
05:10:52,660 --> 05:10:53,600
Oh my god!

7922
05:10:53,880 --> 05:10:54,080
Ah!

7923
05:10:55,620 --> 05:10:57,280
Everyone came for me!

7924
05:10:57,780 --> 05:10:58,840
Oh my god!

7925
05:10:59,680 --> 05:11:00,500
It's fine.

7926
05:11:01,600 --> 05:11:02,320
Last guy is here.

7927
05:11:02,400 --> 05:11:02,620
No.

7928
05:11:02,880 --> 05:11:04,040
No, you cannot die.

7929
05:11:04,580 --> 05:11:06,000
You cannot die.

7930
05:11:06,620 --> 05:11:07,700
You cannot die.

7931
05:11:07,760 --> 05:11:10,560
I don't know if I trust Obama Rose Toy.

7932
05:11:11,280 --> 05:11:13,320
I... I don't know.

7933
05:11:13,580 --> 05:11:16,900
I don't know if... Wait, that's a different team.

7934
05:11:18,060 --> 05:11:24,200
I just realized... I just realized that might be a different team.

7935
05:11:27,060 --> 05:11:27,720
All right.

7936
05:11:28,000 --> 05:11:29,380
I trust Obama.

7937
05:11:29,580 --> 05:11:31,560
Oh my god, Obama did it!

7938
05:11:33,900 --> 05:11:35,380
That's... That actually is a new team.

7939
05:11:35,800 --> 05:11:37,280
I heard, like, grenades.

7940
05:11:42,890 --> 05:11:44,750
Oh, please tell me there's... Oh my god.

7941
05:11:45,270 --> 05:11:45,990
Oh my god, please.

7942
05:11:46,050 --> 05:11:46,830
I need these attachments.

7943
05:11:47,030 --> 05:11:47,530
I don't care.

7944
05:11:48,750 --> 05:11:49,730
I don't care.

7945
05:11:49,910 --> 05:11:51,830
I know my team got shot at.

7946
05:11:52,130 --> 05:11:54,590
But I really needed those attachments.

7947
05:12:07,060 --> 05:12:07,500
Okay.

7948
05:12:07,720 --> 05:12:08,280
Don't cut up!

7949
05:12:11,180 --> 05:12:11,620
Don't cut up!

7950
05:12:11,620 --> 05:12:12,520
Alright, that's good.

7951
05:12:12,680 --> 05:12:13,600
You killed an enemy.

7952
05:12:15,280 --> 05:12:16,540
Oh my god, thank god.

7953
05:12:16,800 --> 05:12:17,840
I killed that hooligan.

7954
05:12:18,280 --> 05:12:19,560
Alright, there we go.

7955
05:12:21,360 --> 05:12:21,800
Obama!

7956
05:12:22,380 --> 05:12:23,240
Welcome back.

7957
05:12:23,580 --> 05:12:24,360
You're back, sir.

7958
05:12:26,980 --> 05:12:29,620
The other guy fucking left like a pussy.

7959
05:12:30,900 --> 05:12:33,760
You got a mess.

7960
05:12:34,180 --> 05:12:35,420
Okay, he's just gonna res.

7961
05:12:35,600 --> 05:12:37,160
Like, I don't fucking know what he's gonna do.

7962
05:12:40,280 --> 05:12:41,660
The third term.

7963
05:12:42,020 --> 05:12:43,500
Welcome back, Mr. President.

7964
05:12:47,060 --> 05:12:48,280
Dude, you're just gonna res.

7965
05:12:48,800 --> 05:12:49,300
Like...

7966
05:12:49,300 --> 05:12:50,860
He's just gonna crap and res.

7967
05:12:51,720 --> 05:12:53,360
Welcome to Apex Legends.

7968
05:12:59,650 --> 05:13:00,530
Is that it?

7969
05:13:02,990 --> 05:13:03,870
We're people!

7970
05:13:04,270 --> 05:13:05,370
Oh wait, actually I shouldn't say that.

7971
05:13:05,510 --> 05:13:06,230
That was like hell.

7972
05:13:06,230 --> 05:13:06,970
We're in the next ring.

7973
05:13:07,210 --> 05:13:09,970
That was actually hell when they kept coming and they didn't stop coming.

7974
05:13:12,130 --> 05:13:12,930
Oh, they did it.

7975
05:13:13,510 --> 05:13:13,610
A champion fell.

7976
05:13:13,630 --> 05:13:14,630
Look, see, I told you.

7977
05:13:15,150 --> 05:13:15,710
Whoever did that.

7978
05:13:15,910 --> 05:13:16,390
They res.

7979
05:13:17,570 --> 05:13:18,770
No need to make a fuss.

7980
05:13:18,990 --> 05:13:20,770
I told you they were gonna do that.

7981
05:13:22,350 --> 05:13:23,070
This is our...

7982
05:13:23,070 --> 05:13:23,970
Look, there he is!

7983
05:13:24,210 --> 05:13:25,030
There he is!

7984
05:13:26,250 --> 05:13:27,270
They did it!

7985
05:13:28,890 --> 05:13:29,290
Congratulations!

7986
05:13:29,970 --> 05:13:31,390
That's the team we killed, guys.

7987
05:13:31,390 --> 05:13:32,270
They did the thing.

7988
05:13:34,150 --> 05:13:35,270
That's them!

7989
05:13:37,010 --> 05:13:38,530
You close your eyes.

7990
05:13:41,010 --> 05:13:42,850
They feel like nothing.

7991
05:13:43,370 --> 05:13:44,490
Change that off.

7992
05:13:49,010 --> 05:13:49,510
Oh.

7993
05:13:51,910 --> 05:13:53,250
I hit those.

7994
05:13:53,410 --> 05:13:53,710
Nice.

7995
05:13:54,230 --> 05:13:55,910
Of course I hit those, Doki.

7996
05:14:02,410 --> 05:14:03,350
That's right.

7997
05:14:03,470 --> 05:14:04,930
Come in through that door.

7998
05:14:06,410 --> 05:14:07,170
Yippee!

7999
05:14:07,670 --> 05:14:08,490
Oh hey, peacekeeper.

8000
05:14:11,980 --> 05:14:12,640
Okay.

8001
05:14:15,580 --> 05:14:16,240
Yay!

8002
05:14:19,620 --> 05:14:21,330
I was gonna feel like...

8003
05:14:21,760 --> 05:14:23,260
Alright, nothing for Doki.

8004
05:14:26,120 --> 05:14:26,780
Wait.

8005
05:14:27,080 --> 05:14:27,800
Oh, that's us.

8006
05:14:30,140 --> 05:14:32,860
I mean, they're fighting like, on the other side.

8007
05:14:34,320 --> 05:14:35,180
We leave?

8008
05:14:35,800 --> 05:14:36,600
You know what?

8009
05:14:36,820 --> 05:14:37,660
Let's leave.

8010
05:14:39,890 --> 05:14:40,220
Nah.

8011
05:14:41,080 --> 05:14:42,440
No, I don't need it.

8012
05:14:42,460 --> 05:14:43,100
It's dirty.

8013
05:14:43,850 --> 05:14:44,560
Oh shit.

8014
05:14:45,960 --> 05:14:49,090
Of course the one time, I decided to like...

8015
05:14:49,620 --> 05:14:51,320
Fucking stand in the open.

8016
05:14:56,530 --> 05:14:58,150
I swear to god.

8017
05:14:58,610 --> 05:14:59,130
I...

8018
05:14:59,740 --> 05:15:01,210
The one time...

8019
05:15:01,210 --> 05:15:04,030
I decided to stand in the open!

8020
05:15:04,670 --> 05:15:06,310
The one time!

8021
05:15:06,310 --> 05:15:06,530
How is my name?

8022
05:15:09,950 --> 05:15:11,350
What?

8023
05:15:19,390 --> 05:15:26,690
Har fast!对 Because...

8024
05:15:26,690 --> 05:15:28,630
Is not a Doki day.

8025
05:15:35,260 --> 05:15:36,100
Alright.

8026
05:15:36,860 --> 05:15:38,120
I trust Obama.

8027
05:15:39,100 --> 05:15:40,840
Obama, you got this.

8028
05:15:41,460 --> 05:15:43,360
We still have Obama.

8029
05:15:43,540 --> 05:15:44,500
He'll save us.

8030
05:15:48,220 --> 05:15:50,100
He's here for us.

8031
05:15:51,360 --> 05:15:52,540
Oh my god.

8032
05:15:52,740 --> 05:15:54,960
Is that a new team?

8033
05:15:57,380 --> 05:15:58,960
I cannot tell.

8034
05:16:04,430 --> 05:16:04,810
Oh my god.

8035
05:16:04,870 --> 05:16:05,890
I let it in correctly.

8036
05:16:06,170 --> 05:16:07,370
I let my shots wrong.

8037
05:16:09,190 --> 05:16:09,670
Oh!

8038
05:16:14,010 --> 05:16:14,490
Okay.

8039
05:16:15,630 --> 05:16:16,930
I don't know where people are.

8040
05:16:16,930 --> 05:16:17,770
That's a little issue.

8041
05:16:25,360 --> 05:16:26,420
Everyone's way too split.

8042
05:16:29,160 --> 05:16:30,940
We're all so far apart from each other.

8043
05:16:31,200 --> 05:16:32,720
I'm a little nervous because of it.

8044
05:16:33,600 --> 05:16:34,360
That's okay.

8045
05:16:36,480 --> 05:16:38,240
Don't fucking walk up here, I guess.

8046
05:16:43,290 --> 05:16:45,050
I just want to make sure they don't walk up.

8047
05:16:51,520 --> 05:16:52,900
Oh, they're all over here.

8048
05:16:53,040 --> 05:16:53,160
Okay.

8049
05:16:55,880 --> 05:16:56,920
What is this fight?

8050
05:17:01,910 --> 05:17:02,750
What the fuck?

8051
05:17:02,970 --> 05:17:03,050
What?

8052
05:17:03,390 --> 05:17:04,350
Where is going on?

8053
05:17:05,110 --> 05:17:06,170
I'm so confused.

8054
05:17:14,500 --> 05:17:16,160
Where did everybody go?

8055
05:17:22,540 --> 05:17:24,160
Did everyone go- went to zone?

8056
05:17:24,980 --> 05:17:26,300
Oh, I see them.

8057
05:17:26,540 --> 05:17:27,060
Yeah, they did.

8058
05:17:30,440 --> 05:17:31,000
They did.

8059
05:17:32,040 --> 05:17:34,360
Where- What go on?

8060
05:17:41,670 --> 05:17:42,750
No, I need a hit.

8061
05:17:46,010 --> 05:17:47,010
We have to take the balloon.

8062
05:17:48,830 --> 05:17:49,490
Let's take the balloon.

8063
05:17:49,610 --> 05:17:50,090
Let's take the balloon.

8064
05:17:50,550 --> 05:17:51,310
Take the balloon.

8065
05:17:52,530 --> 05:17:52,850
Take the balloon!

8066
05:17:56,430 --> 05:17:57,530
Take the balloon- oh, wait.

8067
05:17:57,630 --> 05:17:58,130
They can't.

8068
05:17:59,210 --> 05:18:00,590
Wait, we might be fucked.

8069
05:18:00,910 --> 05:18:01,230
Guys?

8070
05:18:06,060 --> 05:18:06,700
Guys?

8071
05:18:07,640 --> 05:18:08,040
Guys?

8072
05:18:20,520 --> 05:18:21,860
I mean, I got through.

8073
05:18:23,780 --> 05:18:25,000
I got through.

8074
05:18:26,040 --> 05:18:30,960
I- Why evac when I'm through?

8075
05:18:34,760 --> 05:18:36,700
I already made it.

8076
05:18:37,200 --> 05:18:41,040
I don't- I don't listen to people who are not allowed to speak.

8077
05:18:48,980 --> 05:18:49,840
All right.

8078
05:18:51,340 --> 05:18:52,140
Nice.

8079
05:18:54,040 --> 05:18:54,840
Wait.

8080
05:18:55,240 --> 05:18:56,140
They're rezzing.

8081
05:18:59,680 --> 05:19:00,700
Wait a minute!

8082
05:19:01,140 --> 05:19:02,480
They're rezzing!

8083
05:19:05,660 --> 05:19:07,340
Oh my god, I stood on the rock.

8084
05:19:07,420 --> 05:19:08,180
That was a mistake.

8085
05:19:09,180 --> 05:19:09,940
Nice!

8086
05:19:11,640 --> 05:19:12,680
There you go.

8087
05:19:15,080 --> 05:19:15,760
Pew pew pew!

8088
05:19:17,120 --> 05:19:18,520
They have their guns.

8089
05:19:21,500 --> 05:19:22,780
I stood on- Fuck.

8090
05:19:23,460 --> 05:19:23,900
Poor.

8091
05:19:31,830 --> 05:19:32,550
What's that unlucky?

8092
05:19:32,650 --> 05:19:33,190
Where did it go?

8093
05:19:33,570 --> 05:19:35,670
Jesus Christ, that is- No!

8094
05:19:38,230 --> 05:19:38,950
Duck hunt.

8095
05:19:41,690 --> 05:19:43,310
I accidentally duck hunted.

8096
05:19:44,150 --> 05:19:44,690
Wait, somebody.

8097
05:19:48,690 --> 05:19:49,950
He died to ring.

8098
05:19:57,060 --> 05:19:58,600
Jesus, I almost killed him too.

8099
05:20:00,420 --> 05:20:01,000
All right.

8100
05:20:01,280 --> 05:20:02,620
I almost killed that guy.

8101
05:20:04,860 --> 05:20:06,060
Don't get the cross.

8102
05:20:11,180 --> 05:20:12,430
It's dumb, but it works.

8103
05:20:13,550 --> 05:20:14,670
Recharging my shields.

8104
05:20:15,050 --> 05:20:16,050
Recharging my shields.

8105
05:20:16,390 --> 05:20:16,770
One sec.

8106
05:20:19,210 --> 05:20:19,730
Oh my god!

8107
05:20:19,990 --> 05:20:20,330
Gomez!

8108
05:20:27,580 --> 05:20:28,920
Gomez, you fucker.

8109
05:20:30,460 --> 05:20:31,660
You fucker, Gomez.

8110
05:20:34,720 --> 05:20:35,340
Gomez.

8111
05:20:36,420 --> 05:20:37,700
Not today, Capatib.

8112
05:20:38,020 --> 05:20:39,200
We've got people depending on you.

8113
05:20:50,900 --> 05:20:51,620
All right.

8114
05:20:52,260 --> 05:20:53,020
All right.

8115
05:20:53,920 --> 05:20:54,800
Recharging my shields.

8116
05:20:55,020 --> 05:20:55,460
One sec.

8117
05:20:56,320 --> 05:20:58,020
Okay, we gotta get in there.

8118
05:21:02,970 --> 05:21:03,750
It's all right.

8119
05:21:05,450 --> 05:21:06,970
I have more of this.

8120
05:21:07,690 --> 05:21:08,670
I needed that.

8121
05:21:08,870 --> 05:21:09,810
All right, we wait.

8122
05:21:10,190 --> 05:21:12,570
I don't mind playing a little bit, pussy.

8123
05:21:14,030 --> 05:21:14,850
We stay, we stay.

8124
05:21:14,910 --> 05:21:15,510
They have to come to us.

8125
05:21:15,670 --> 05:21:18,510
I know, I just want to grab that.

8126
05:21:22,730 --> 05:21:24,030
Wait, who gave him...

8127
05:21:24,030 --> 05:21:24,990
Who allowed him to speak?

8128
05:21:27,290 --> 05:21:27,730
Chad!

8129
05:21:27,950 --> 05:21:29,310
Did you give him permission to speak?

8130
05:21:32,740 --> 05:21:33,500
Over here.

8131
05:21:37,940 --> 05:21:38,540
All right.

8132
05:21:41,140 --> 05:21:41,820
What?

8133
05:21:44,360 --> 05:21:45,020
That's right!

8134
05:21:45,340 --> 05:21:47,260
And this better not change!

8135
05:21:52,060 --> 05:21:53,560
What are we looking at?

8136
05:21:53,780 --> 05:21:54,340
I'm curious.

8137
05:22:00,860 --> 05:22:02,080
What is over there?

8138
05:22:06,790 --> 05:22:08,450
Wait, the other squad?

8139
05:22:08,870 --> 05:22:10,570
Wait, what's going on?

8140
05:22:13,510 --> 05:22:16,030
Wait, what the fuck is going on?

8141
05:22:23,520 --> 05:22:25,580
What is going on in there?

8142
05:22:25,840 --> 05:22:27,540
In this tiny hole?

8143
05:22:34,540 --> 05:22:36,020
Wait, there's some...

8144
05:22:36,020 --> 05:22:37,180
What the fuck?

8145
05:22:37,360 --> 05:22:38,440
There's something over there!

8146
05:22:44,010 --> 05:22:45,810
Okay, that...

8147
05:22:45,810 --> 05:22:47,390
What the...

8148
05:22:47,390 --> 05:22:49,390
What the fuck is that game?

8149
05:22:49,770 --> 05:22:51,210
What the...

8150
05:22:51,790 --> 05:22:53,590
I think we had zero grenades!

8151
05:22:54,250 --> 05:22:55,290
What the fuck?

8152
05:22:58,230 --> 05:22:59,710
What is...

8153
05:22:59,710 --> 05:23:02,050
This is a bronze silver lobby.

8154
05:23:02,430 --> 05:23:03,170
I...

8155
05:23:03,170 --> 05:23:04,110
Oh...

8156
05:23:05,050 --> 05:23:05,950
Man...

8157
05:23:06,880 --> 05:23:07,330
I...

8158
05:23:08,210 --> 05:23:08,790
Man...

8159
05:23:08,790 --> 05:23:10,730
Bronze players are so good now.

8160
05:23:10,730 --> 05:23:11,810
Like...

8161
05:23:12,730 --> 05:23:14,050
Braun... Braun...

8162
05:23:14,730 --> 05:23:18,250
Braun-Silver players are so good now.

8163
05:23:18,510 --> 05:23:20,210
Like, when did that happen?

8164
05:23:22,690 --> 05:23:24,730
She can now go...

8165
05:23:30,470 --> 05:23:31,910
Oh my god.

8166
05:23:32,810 --> 05:23:33,890
Oh my god.

8167
05:23:34,110 --> 05:23:34,970
Oh hey, I'm going.

8168
05:23:35,370 --> 05:23:35,930
How many?

8169
05:23:36,150 --> 05:23:37,670
Whoa, 687.

8170
05:23:37,890 --> 05:23:38,310
Nice.

8171
05:23:40,950 --> 05:23:41,950
That's true.

8172
05:23:42,410 --> 05:23:43,090
That's true.

8173
05:23:43,250 --> 05:23:44,990
They all know how to...

8174
05:23:45,950 --> 05:23:48,110
They all know how to aim.

8175
05:23:48,450 --> 05:23:49,550
That's actually...

8176
05:23:49,550 --> 05:23:50,470
Or maybe it was gold.

8177
05:23:50,470 --> 05:23:51,030
I don't remember.

8178
05:23:51,170 --> 05:23:53,650
Was it gold lobby or silver lobby?

8179
05:23:55,010 --> 05:23:55,890
We're free.

8180
05:23:56,370 --> 05:23:56,790
We're free.

8181
05:23:57,050 --> 05:23:57,350
Yay!

8182
05:23:57,870 --> 05:23:58,710
I'm satisfied.

8183
05:24:01,210 --> 05:24:02,950
I am happy now.

8184
05:24:03,610 --> 05:24:05,510
Alright, thank you everybody for coming.

8185
05:24:06,270 --> 05:24:07,350
To watch.

8186
05:24:07,550 --> 05:24:08,790
For checking the early access.

8187
05:24:08,790 --> 05:24:10,550
I'll just check...

8188
05:24:10,550 --> 05:24:12,570
I'll check back in a couple more months.

8189
05:24:12,830 --> 05:24:14,570
Back to Apex when anything else changes.

8190
05:24:15,570 --> 05:24:15,830
Um...

8191
05:24:15,830 --> 05:24:16,970
Brain tired now.

8192
05:24:17,150 --> 05:24:18,030
As always, everybody.

8193
05:24:18,310 --> 05:24:19,290
Stay hydrated.

8194
05:24:19,770 --> 05:24:21,110
Maybe it's cause like...

8195
05:24:21,110 --> 05:24:22,750
I'm really delirious right now too.

8196
05:24:22,870 --> 05:24:23,350
So I have camp.

8197
05:24:23,470 --> 05:24:24,990
I'm not playing as well as I should be.

8198
05:24:26,390 --> 05:24:27,510
You can tell...

8199
05:24:27,510 --> 05:24:30,890
My best performance was definitely the first couple of games.

8200
05:24:31,250 --> 05:24:31,610
Before...

8201
05:24:31,610 --> 05:24:32,890
And then I just started...

8202
05:24:33,590 --> 05:24:33,950
I...

8203
05:24:33,950 --> 05:24:35,890
Mentally, I was not...

8204
05:24:35,890 --> 05:24:36,290
I was...

8205
05:24:36,290 --> 05:24:36,910
I crashed.

8206
05:24:37,330 --> 05:24:37,490
I...

8207
05:24:39,550 --> 05:24:40,810
But I had fun in the end.

8208
05:24:40,910 --> 05:24:41,610
I had fun.

8209
05:24:41,870 --> 05:24:43,230
But thank you everybody for watching.

8210
05:24:43,450 --> 05:24:44,130
As always, everybody.

8211
05:24:44,310 --> 05:24:44,970
Stay hydrated.

8212
05:24:45,190 --> 05:24:45,590
Pause your check.

8213
05:24:45,830 --> 05:24:47,310
Get a move around to get that blood flow.

8214
05:24:47,370 --> 05:24:48,830
If you stay up for me, it depends.

05:24:49,010 --> 05:24:49,970

Doesn't it chat?

Anyway.

05:25:02,730 --> 05:25:03,430
