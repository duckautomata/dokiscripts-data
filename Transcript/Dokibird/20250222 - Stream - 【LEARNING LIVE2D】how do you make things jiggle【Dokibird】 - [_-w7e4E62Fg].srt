1
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:52,850
Swap Hello everybo- oh my gosh, sorry, I sound like I'm about to fucking die.

2
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,750
But hello everyone!

3
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,150
Hello, hello, hello.

4
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:02,410
Today we have a very, very special guest here.

5
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,870
Who's gonna be our little teacher.

6
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,450
Who's gonna be teaching us how to do- use live 2D.

7
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,610
Uh, would you like to introduce yourself?

8
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,510
And I'm sorry I sound- I'm sorry for being late, guys.

9
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:22,530
My dog wanted walkies, and when my dog wants walkies, then I can't stop him, he's gonna pee.

10
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,570
Like, he needs to use the bathroom.

11
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,350
I can't stop that.

12
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,010
Anyway, would you like to introduce yourself?

13
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,230
Uh, yes, so, um, I'm NimYoi.

14
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,990
I guess it's a bit of a surprise that I'm here.

15
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:45,830
One viewer of mine named Alex, uh, won in the charity stream, and we commented me for the collab.

16
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:53,490
So, I'm very excited, but also nervous, because it's my first collab, and I think- Yes, it's your first collab, you liar!

17
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,590
No, first big collab!

18
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:05,190
Like, first real big one, so, like, um, I'm not super experienced with collabs either, I don't have money.

19
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:08,110
Uh, but I'm very excited to learn a lot.

20
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,930
Did you say I don't have money?

21
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,910
Did you- Money, money, money, money, money!

22
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,490
Oh, okay, I was gonna be like, oh my god, are you okay?

23
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:27,930
So, as you can see, or hear my English, it's the best, so be prepared for it.

24
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:34,090
I was just like, sorry, I have sick ears right now, guys.

25
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:43,750
Guys, I have- my ears aren't listening very well either right now, because my whole body is not okay at the moment.

26
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,310
They're like, don't- you can't ask that!

27
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,130
You can't just be like, aren't you poor?

28
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,750
I- I- I thought it was the most confusing thing ever!

29
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,630
I was like, wait, why did you say you don't have money?

30
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:58,710
Alright, for those who don't know, she is European.

31
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:58,850
European?

32
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:04,890
From, I believe, you're a German VTuber, right?

33
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:07,850
Hello?

34
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:09,250
Hello?

35
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:09,730
Hello?

36
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,670
Oh, I was like, are you like a German VTuber, right?

37
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,130
I'm a German- no, no, I'm an English VTuber.

38
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:18,950
But I'm from Germany.

39
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:19,910
Oh!

40
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:27,630
You mostly primarily- you say you mostly primarily stream in English.

41
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,310
Yes, exactly.

42
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,110
Because I want to learn more English.

43
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,770
And a lot of my clients are only English.

44
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,330
So, it's a good thing to stream in English.

45
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,530
Also, I can reach more people with rigging in English now.

46
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:52,150
Don't worry, even my chat was like, your English is better than mine, which is not- guys, it's not a high- it's not a very high standard to have better English than me, guys.

47
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,210
We all know I'm- English is my first language.

48
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:05,250
So, yes, huge shout-out to Alex for arranging all of this.

49
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:09,450
I'm sorry that it took so long to get all of this started.

50
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:14,050
My body is not okay, and it has not been okay for half a year now.

51
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:20,410
We were supposed to have a collab, like, last year.

52
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:21,910
And then I got sick.

53
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,350
And then I was- and then I went to Japan.

54
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,250
And then I got sick again.

55
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,850
And then I got better.

56
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,490
And then I got sick again.

57
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,910
But then I- and then she was like, maybe we should reschedule.

58
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,710
And I was like, no more rescheduling!

59
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:41,830
And we are- We cannot- we cannot reschedule anymore.

60
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,870
I- I will- I can do this.

61
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:50,110
My body might be dying, but I can do this.

62
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,270
So, here we are!

63
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,470
Finally learning Live2D!

64
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:59,210
So, anyway.

65
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,670
So there was a lot of suggestions on what we were gonna do together.

66
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,190
We were, like, thinking we should play some games.

67
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,870
If we should, like, you know.

68
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:12,050
I remember, you know, I wanted to try Marvel Rivals at first.

69
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:16,650
And then- but then I thought, like, you know, since this is a very special collab for her and me.

70
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,110
I figured it should be more than just, you know.

71
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,570
We play just a game.

72
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:24,790
And since you are a Live2D rigger, and you are an artist.

73
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,670
I figured we go with a strong suit.

74
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,430
Like, you showing us how Live2D works, because I've never tried Live2D before.

75
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:35,530
So, if you see this on the screen, that's not mine.

76
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,510
I mean, that is you!

77
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:38,730
You are mine, guys.

78
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,730
Dragoons are mine.

79
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,550
But, no, guys.

80
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,950
I am not banning you.

81
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,690
I am not disowning you.

82
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:48,910
I meant to say, this is not my screen right now.

83
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:57,770
And she will be Live2D-ing a dragoon for us.

84
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,970
And showing us, like, the process of how it works.

85
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,810
Do you think you can get all this done in, like, one stream?

86
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:05,710
Yes, of course.

87
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:06,910
Woah, really?

88
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,510
Yes, this is a gift from me and my friend.

89
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:16,530
Like, we wanna give it off to you so you can share with anyone to have a jiggly bird.

90
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,370
Oh my god.

91
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:23,470
Can you give a toggle where, like, they can have, like, some jiggle physics, you know?

92
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,330
It will have lots of jiggle physics.

93
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:27,670
Trust me.

94
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:29,610
At least somebody has them.

95
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:30,530
That's the reason we are here.

96
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:33,530
At least someone gets to have them.

97
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:34,130
You know?

98
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:40,530
I'm just standing at first, but now I understand.

99
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,850
Oh, yes, because I'm right next to you.

100
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,890
Look, I have other physics, okay?

101
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,530
Like, it's somewhere else, okay?

102
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,150
It's somewhere else.

103
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,990
You have other jiggly physics.

104
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,190
Guys, no, no, no.

105
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,550
Let me move my tablet this way.

106
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:58,530
Let me...

107
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,630
So I'm not cum.

108
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:08,250
Let me move my tablet here so you guys don't wanna look at me, guys.

109
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,770
You have other jiggly physics.

110
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:18,570
Alright, so how long have you been a rigger?

111
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,170
For how long, you ask?

112
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,970
Yeah, yeah, how long have you been doing this?

113
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,630
Okay, for already, I think, around four years.

114
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,770
But when I started, I wasn't taking it so serious, so...

115
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:36,350
I think it's been since two years when I started really doing models for other people.

116
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:43,230
And, yeah, actually, I started rigging because I wanted to get a model for myself.

117
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:47,190
And back then, back in the days, there were a lot of riggers.

118
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,830
There was Ivan Vertex, yes.

119
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:50,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

120
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,110
But not many other people like now.

121
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:59,390
But then I never had time to do my own B2M model, so...

122
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,530
Wait, did you not rig yourself?

123
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,750
No, not in the start.

124
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,610
I never finished any rig for myself.

125
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,610
Oh, I see.

126
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,930
But you've learned so much and now you're doing it yourself now, too.

127
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:13,110
Yes.

128
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:18,390
I mean, I feel like being your own, like, pop-up has, like, so many advantages.

129
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:23,910
Because you can, like, add, like, you know, if you have an idea, you'll just be like, I'm gonna add this right now or I'm gonna add that right now.

130
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:28,250
It has many positive but also some negative points.

131
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,370
Like, if you are a perfectionist, let's say it like this.

132
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:34,490
But, yeah, what I mean is, like, you are never done with your rigging.

133
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,050
Like, really, never.

134
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,450
I still rig today on my model.

135
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,650
So, how many have you done?

136
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:43,770
How many have you done?

137
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:45,710
Oh, Lord.

138
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:50,570
I think... Wait, let me go on my website because I lost the card.

139
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,290
Oh, you have your own website?

140
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:52,630
Oh, my gosh.

141
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,510
Yeah, it's just memyeye.com.

142
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,850
So, it's easy to find.

143
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,070
My clients are listed there, but let me...

144
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:04,550
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14...

145
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:10,130
I think about now, there aren't everyone listed.

146
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,210
So, like, 30 models so far.

147
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,250
Yeah.

148
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,730
Oh, my God.

149
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,030
Out of how many years?

150
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:22,830
Actually, for 4 years, but like 2 and 3 years.

151
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,130
Oh, my God.

152
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,890
That's a lot of models.

153
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,230
That's a lot of skinsuits.

154
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,130
Yeah, I'm like a bunny.

155
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,350
You know...

156
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,790
Oh, my God.

157
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:36,930
Whoa.

158
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:38,990
Are you pregnant right now?

159
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:40,930
Always.

160
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,150
There is no time when I'm not.

161
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,850
Oh, you're never not pregnant.

162
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:44,510
Okay.

163
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,150
Oh, my God.

164
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:46,690
You're never...

165
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,490
Oh, man.

166
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,050
Let me move the tablet back.

167
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,650
Now I know why it's like that.

168
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,870
It's always...

169
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:01,630
It's a special...

170
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:08,330
Sometimes I'm questioning myself why do I have fox ears when bunny ears...

171
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,110
You should be a rabbit.

172
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,470
I mean, you can make that your new... another outfit.

173
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:16,550
I was thinking about it because it would truly fit.

174
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,190
Oh, my God.

175
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:21,070
All right.

176
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:24,490
So, how do you first... What do you first do when you...

177
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:24,790
Okay.

178
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,390
What we are first doing...

179
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:31,950
I just tried a little bit around before we start the stream just to look what I'm aiming for.

180
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:35,310
And I can show you what I'm aiming for.

181
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,750
I will redo some stuff.

182
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,250
But we have here some jiggly things.

183
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,570
We will adjust that.

184
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:46,490
But I was thinking of going for this one now.

185
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:50,910
We are going to delete everything and we do some parts.

186
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:56,950
I was trying around but first of all, we start with the dragoon's eyes.

187
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:58,290
So, they can blink.

188
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,270
Like here, this one.

189
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,510
Oh, my God.

190
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,890
I'm already so lost.

191
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,950
There are so many texts on the screen.

192
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,650
Oh, my God.

193
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:09,850
Oh, my... No, no.

194
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:10,770
Keep it at the top.

195
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:11,290
Yeah, yeah.

196
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,090
Leave it up here.

197
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:12,550
No, no.

198
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:13,250
I like that.

199
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,030
No, no, no.

200
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:14,930
We should... Yeah, yeah.

201
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,130
Let me help this one.

202
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,210
Yeah, no, no.

203
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:23,150
That's perfect.

204
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,830
Guys, that's actually perfect.

205
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,270
Yeah, we kind of have to like this.

206
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:32,870
That's my special dragoon right there.

207
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:33,830
He's special.

208
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:37,270
A very special fellow.

209
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,630
He's my very special little guy.

210
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,030
Mama said I'm special.

211
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,630
I really love those eyes now.

212
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,530
This is a very amazing idea.

213
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,910
What we also can do is, of course...

214
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:56,910
When he goes down...

215
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:01,790
What we are going to add is like a teabag.

216
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:04,130
You can imagine like a small teabag.

217
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,130
Oh, that's so cool.

218
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,550
So...

219
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,050
Like a little teabag, yeah.

220
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:11,890
Oh, my God.

221
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:12,770
Yeah, it's cool.

222
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:12,990
Yes!

223
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:18,770
And then, whenever they do something nicer...

224
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,830
Maybe Marvel Rivals, you know?

225
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,610
They can do something like that.

226
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,070
It's so good.

227
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,310
I love that.

228
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:25,710
Oh, my God.

229
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,350
You can just do that?

230
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,390
That's so fast.

231
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,570
That's... Oh, my God.

232
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:30,970
That's a professional right there.

233
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,090
She did that in like 5-10 seconds.

234
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,010
Like, what the hell?

235
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:37,770
This is so like... And then, imagine you do the teabag.

236
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:40,090
And that's a...

237
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:43,450
Imagine...

238
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:46,130
That's what disrespect would be like.

239
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:47,570
It's so beautiful.

240
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:48,470
Oh, my God.

241
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:48,670
Wait.

242
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,930
You should wag his tail too, right?

243
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:51,630
Yes!

244
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,630
That's of course possible too.

245
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,950
We have the tail separator too.

246
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,790
You can have like a wiggle here.

247
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,390
But I will add some physics to it.

248
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:03,950
So, let me show you.

249
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:04,870
Tail wag.

250
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:10,390
We add this as like the automatic thing here.

251
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,390
So, we don't add anything on here.

252
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:15,930
But then, we add the tail wag physics to make it more jiggle.

253
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,330
We love the jiggle, you know?

254
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:19,930
Oh, you can jiggle it too?

255
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:21,950
Yes, of course.

256
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:22,990
Oh, my God.

257
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:23,230
Wait.

258
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,230
Can like I have him like...

259
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,870
Can I have the drag... Can we have a toggle where the dragoon holds like two basketballs?

260
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,530
And then, the basketballs are made of jello.

261
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:34,930
So, then when he goes up and down, it's like jiggle physics.

262
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:36,930
I'm sure it's possible.

263
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:41,190
You can send me over what you need and I can finish it after the stream.

264
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:42,550
No, no, no.

265
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:46,710
We can just get like a PNG of a basketball.

266
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,150
And then...

267
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:49,930
We don't need a draft.

268
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:54,370
Let's get a free stock photo of a basketball.

269
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:58,990
And then just copy and paste it into the arms.

270
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:03,250
And then we just make it like... It's like a water... Oh, it's like a water balloon.

271
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:04,250
Oh, wait.

272
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,330
No, a water balloon.

273
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:06,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

274
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:10,030
And then the dragoon will hold like water balloons.

275
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:12,050
Oh, we get PNG of a water balloon.

276
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,110
And...

277
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,870
Oh, my God.

278
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,550
This is not... Is this not what you wanted?

279
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,350
Is this...

280
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:24,770
Hilarious.

281
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,370
You have to... You have crazy ideas.

282
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,970
Yeah, yeah, like... Yeah, we're ballers, guys.

283
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:33,550
Alright, okay.

284
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:41,290
I'm going to look for... If you're done with the jiggle physics, we can add the basketball into...

285
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:41,710
Oh, wait, wait, no.

286
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:42,870
We should do water balloons.

287
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:43,930
It makes it more natural.

288
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:44,430
Oh, water balloons.

289
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:44,910
Okay.

290
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,170
That makes it... Whoa!

291
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,730
It's so sm... What the... Wait, what happened?

292
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:49,610
What did you do?

293
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:55,370
I just looked away one second and now the tail's wagging.

294
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:59,370
I was just using like a path deformer.

295
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,790
You can...

296
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:03,670
Click on this and then you can make a path deformer.

297
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,250
Wait, can you make it into a cool ass?

298
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,950
Can you... Actually, can you make it into a...

299
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:09,770
Oh, my God.

300
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:10,330
Wait, no.

301
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:10,770
Yes.

302
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,570
Can you make it into a cool ass?

303
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:16,230
Like...

304
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,830
You're insulting like...

305
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah, like an ass.

306
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:21,370
Just make it...

307
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,830
Wait, no.

308
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:29,090
Wait, I want him... I want the dragon to be able to elongate their tails.

309
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,430
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

310
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,670
You have too much of...

311
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,270
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

312
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:46,370
You should be able to make their tail longer as a toggle when they're excited.

313
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:47,970
Yes.

314
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:48,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

315
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,250
Wait, what?

316
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:51,130
What?

317
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,650
You told me, like, no.

318
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:54,650
Yeah, yeah.

319
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,190
How do you do that?

320
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,570
How do you do that?

321
00:16:58,590 --> 00:16:59,810
No, no, it'll be funny.

322
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:00,450
It'll be...

323
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:03,250
Okay, we can make it like tail...

324
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:04,330
Yeah, yeah.

325
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:05,470
Excited.

326
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,450
And let me make it as a blend shape.

327
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:07,910
Yeah.

328
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,090
And then just take this.

329
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,570
Oh, wait, let me...

330
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:12,670
Wait, this is a zero.

331
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,270
Oh, my God.

332
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,830
Wait, maybe I should be a rigger, guys.

333
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:18,370
Maybe...

334
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,310
Oh, my God, guys.

335
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:24,290
If I knew how to do that, I'd do that every...

336
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:27,470
If I knew how to do that, I'd rig these every day.

337
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,170
Yeah, let me make it more pretty here.

338
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,150
Personal request.

339
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,070
So, this is this excited tail.

340
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,790
Oh, my God, it's...

341
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:43,570
Like...

342
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:44,470
Oh, I'm happy.

343
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:44,590
See?

344
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,330
I'm so happy.

345
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:54,570
Nice.

346
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,490
That's great.

347
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:58,450
This is celerial.

348
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,870
Can the wagon tail, when the tail is long?

349
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,130
Can you wagon?

350
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,330
I can make it work.

351
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:08,050
Actually, this is the cool thing about blend shapes, actually.

352
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:11,130
Because I can use a blend shape right now.

353
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,410
The physics from this one will work on this.

354
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:19,110
But if I make, like, a tail wag long, you see?

355
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:19,570
Yeah.

356
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:24,250
I can use it for this state of tail.

357
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,690
And then we can...

358
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,150
I need to just...

359
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,890
Oh, my God, it's beautiful.

360
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:34,410
When the dragoon is happy to see...

361
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,190
I only need to get my life...

362
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,070
Oh, it was on a different monitor.

363
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:41,490
This is why I didn't see my...

364
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:43,730
Okay, so...

365
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,690
We add this point here.

366
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:46,390
Yeah.

367
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,290
If Live2D lets me.

368
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:51,230
Here.

369
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,510
Change this to this.

370
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:56,210
Whoops.

371
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:57,090
Here.

372
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,650
And then we can...

373
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:02,470
Oh, my God, look how flexible your tails are.

374
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,830
They are super flexible.

375
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,610
Oh, my God, look at...

376
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,570
Oh, my God, the tail can twerk on its own.

377
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,470
Look at it go.

378
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:13,550
Wow.

379
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:20,750
You can do so many forms with the tail.

380
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:21,970
And this is so funny.

381
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,770
What we want to have...

382
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:27,030
We need a specific movement for it.

383
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:30,970
So it doesn't deform weirdly with the physics in the end.

384
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:34,150
So we just do a tiny bit.

385
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:34,670
Okay.

386
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:40,590
You always need to think about that you use the power arm and not be on the main.

387
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,650
Yeah.

388
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,430
It's like...

389
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,850
Stop drawing.

390
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:45,550
Why?

391
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,010
You are on the same layer.

392
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:48,890
This is like...

393
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:51,210
This can happen actually with Live2D too.

394
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:54,210
If you don't change the power arm.

395
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,790
Okay, so we have this for the longer tail.

396
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:57,850
Now...

397
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:58,530
Wait.

398
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,630
We go to the...

399
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,870
To the magic...

400
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:04,750
Wait.

401
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:05,210
Here.

402
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:07,230
Limit blend shapes.

403
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:11,350
And we have tail long for a sec.

404
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,030
We want to have it here.

405
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,810
Look at this magic happening in front of us.

406
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,130
Like now we don't want that tail long.

407
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,250
Oh my god.

408
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:22,810
Look at it.

409
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,330
It's like a little dog tail.

410
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,810
It looks really weird.

411
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,430
It's like a little dog tail.

412
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:30,670
Wait.

413
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:32,610
Oh no.

414
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,710
I forgot how to rig.

415
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,250
What's this one?

416
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,290
I swear to god.

417
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,810
This is always me when I'm rigging.

418
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:43,470
There's so many options to pick from.

419
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,010
Wait a minute.

420
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:46,950
I have the better idea.

421
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,990
If I'm too lazy to do things like this.

422
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:49,350
Yeah.

423
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,830
To do some different stuff.

424
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:55,570
I just copy paste the tails and make a toggle with tail switch.

425
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:59,850
And then we have one toggle that works with the...

426
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:00,130
Wait.

427
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,350
So we have here tail long.

428
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:08,110
And we make a toggle here.

429
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,450
Tail long.

430
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,430
This is just for a toggle then.

431
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,450
So the tail switch to...

432
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:15,950
Oh my god.

433
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:17,130
Now you have two tails.

434
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,130
Oh lord.

435
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:19,930
Oh my god.

436
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,470
You're in echidna now.

437
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:22,370
Oh my god.

438
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:22,490
Wait.

439
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:23,510
I want that as a toggle.

440
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,030
Now you're in echidna.

441
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,670
But like for the tail instead of the other part.

442
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,970
Looks like a scissor.

443
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:35,450
Imagine.

444
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,650
Oh my god.

445
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,410
You're like Knuckles, guys.

446
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:44,990
You're just like Knuckles.

447
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:46,630
You guys like Sonic, right?

448
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,710
I like Sonic.

449
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:49,690
Wait, wait.

450
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,370
Yeah, yeah.

451
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,290
We should...

452
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:53,570
I want that as a toggle, a second tail.

453
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:55,370
The second tail.

454
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,210
Okay, okay.

455
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:56,470
Wait.

456
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:59,050
Can we name this Tail 2?

457
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:02,590
Then let's have like Tail 2.

458
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,610
I'll add later the Tail Excited.

459
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:06,930
I mean...

460
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:07,700
Oh, Tail Excited?

461
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:08,330
Yeah.

462
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,290
So, like...

463
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:14,770
What if we put a knife into his hand?

464
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:15,450
He will be like...

465
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,170
Oh, yeah.

466
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:16,810
What?

467
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:18,530
Oh, yeah.

468
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:19,230
Holding a knife.

469
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:19,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

470
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,030
But like water balloons first, of course.

471
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:22,970
Water balloons.

472
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:25,950
Angry chicka.

473
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,250
We can make it angry too.

474
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:31,770
Let's first focus on the physics and then on the toggles.

475
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:32,250
Okay, true, true.

476
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,150
That's more important.

477
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:33,570
Sorry.

478
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:34,630
We got distracted there, guys.

479
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:35,710
You need to jiggle first.

480
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

481
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:38,510
Sorry, guys.

482
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,950
We got very distracted over other things.

483
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:43,250
Sorry.

484
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,730
Our priorities were very different.

485
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:49,750
Let me grab some water balloons stock photos real quick.

486
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:55,130
Water balloons for us.

487
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:57,250
Okay, so what are we doing next?

488
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,190
We are...

489
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:01,370
It is like looking up thing.

490
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:04,470
Because right now it goes down and now it goes up.

491
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,530
And of course we need some physics for up and down physics.

492
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:11,290
Because it would be boring if it doesn't have any physics.

493
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:12,130
Yeah, yeah.

494
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:12,770
That's true.

495
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,590
Then we add some physics for going down.

496
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,320
Then for going up.

497
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:26,420
So what I like to do for going up and down is adding some like animated feature.

498
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,580
Like if it goes down, it stretches.

499
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,140
Like it goes a little bit...

500
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:30,720
Yeah, yeah.

501
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,020
That would make sense.

502
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,400
That makes sense.

503
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:44,420
And then of course what I like to do for the second part is focusing more on the body related physics.

504
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,220
Because we want to keep it simple here.

505
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:48,500
So...

506
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,320
We have this one here more.

507
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,220
We add the tummy look.

508
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:52,640
Oops.

509
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,040
Oh my god.

510
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,180
Because right now...

511
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:00,280
Oh my god, you're so jiggly.

512
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:01,960
Oh my god.

513
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,940
We are not done.

514
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,000
We are not here yet.

515
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,920
There comes lots of more jiggly physics.

516
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,900
Oh my god, you're so...

517
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,200
You're so jiggly.

518
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,140
I think like...

519
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,740
Okay, when we turn to the right and we turn to the left...

520
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:17,000
You should be able to see a little bit of the butt.

521
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,100
You what?

522
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,880
Okay, so how far can he turn right or left?

523
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,420
So you know how like...

524
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,120
Okay, so like you know how like...

525
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,020
You know like the little...

526
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,680
When you turn to the left or right...

527
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,940
Just a little the butt is showing.

528
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,460
So like you know like a little bit of the ass.

529
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,240
And...

530
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,320
I mean we could get the...

531
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,980
Get the cheeks there, you know?

532
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,600
Oh my god.

533
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,880
Just like a little bit.

534
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,940
You know like when you turn left and right just a little bit.

535
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,340
Just the right cheek there.

536
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:53,860
Just a little bit of a cake.

537
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,040
You know like Venom.

538
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,140
Oh, Venom!

539
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,300
Yeah, yeah.

540
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,220
Have you ever seen...

541
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,560
Yeah, just like Venom's cakes.

542
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,060
Just photoshop a Venom's ass.

543
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:07,840
Oh my god.

544
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:11,160
Oh my god, we can photoshop Venom's cake into...

545
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,700
Oh my... See, we're cooking, guys.

546
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,360
We're cooking.

547
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,240
We're gonna give you Venom's implants.

548
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:22,200
Can you see how cute this little guy is?

549
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,100
Oh my god, it's so cute.

550
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,600
Wait, should the eyes also like...

551
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,260
Like squish a little bit there?

552
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,820
Oh yeah, let's add the squish for the eyes.

553
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:32,420
Yeah, yeah.

554
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,400
Let me make it separate.

555
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,300
Eyes squish for...

556
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,020
Oh, it's...

557
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,080
Okay, yeah.

558
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,460
Eye...

559
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,140
Squish.

560
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,800
I'm gonna be called Eye Squish.

561
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,580
Let's make it here.

562
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:51,820
Oh yeah.

563
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,520
Guys, we're learning so much.

564
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,040
Can you stop me from cooking?

565
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,800
I'm making you guys even better.

566
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,700
I'm improving the...

567
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,560
I'm making the ideal dragoon.

568
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:13,800
It's like how Adam is like the peak human design.

569
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,960
I'm creating peak dragoon design right there.

570
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,220
The perfect specimen.

571
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,460
We're going to add some eye physics, like the eye jiggle on the eye opening thing.

572
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,900
Because I think this could be a little bit cuter than...

573
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:33,820
I think if we put it on this one here, it could distract a little bit on the body self now.

574
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:34,860
Yeah, yeah.

575
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,360
The mouth, the face area is like...

576
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,440
Feels weird a little bit when he goes up and down.

577
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:46,300
It looks very like he's only moving his head, but we are...

578
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,920
Missing still the other part here that moves a bit with it down.

579
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,820
To make it more...

580
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:52,820
Deaf?

581
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:53,540
Deaf?

582
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,060
Oh my gosh.

583
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,260
It sounds like I say deaf.

584
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,040
I don't mean deaf.

585
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,060
So, wait a minute.

586
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:01,900
What can we do?

587
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,320
Guys, I found water balloons, guys.

588
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:14,440
We can make him turn up and down as you can see.

589
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,580
This is just very simple made, but...

590
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,640
You can see what I'm meaning here, like...

591
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,540
Wait, that's so good!

592
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,700
So we can do the left and right, yeah?

593
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,560
Yeah, the left and right!

594
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,400
Fabulate prep left and right, or are we doing that now?

595
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,500
It's possible, actually.

596
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,600
Like you turn in this direction.

597
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,220
Yes!

598
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,100
And like this here.

599
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,100
And then you can add a little butt crack here.

600
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,260
Add a little kick there.

601
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,240
What am I doing here?

602
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,460
Wait, are we giving venom implants or are you gonna draw the lump?

603
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,100
I'm thinking.

604
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,480
I mean, the venom things would be so funny, but maybe not fitting.

605
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,620
Okay, true.

606
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,040
Oh my god!

607
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,980
He's all jiggly.

608
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:10,200
I think we actually... Wait a minute.

609
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,180
I have the idea to add this here.

610
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,560
More to the angle part.

611
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,480
And have the angle part here on the physics.

612
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,300
Oh my god.

613
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,620
Wait, so right now if I want...

614
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,880
Look at him fucking go.

615
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,780
What a lad.

616
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,740
Alright, anyway, I'm just sending in the water balloons.

617
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,100
So, and we add this here.

618
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,660
And now we work with the draw order again to show how I've done it.

619
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,800
It's like... Wait.

620
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:52,000
So, like first of all the small head thing goes a little bit up.

621
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:52,560
Yeah.

622
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,460
Then it goes behind the head.

623
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:01,260
And then we have... I need to see still.

624
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,840
Now we need to edit the body still to have it working for this.

625
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,360
Guys, are you writing it down?

626
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,320
Because I'm not.

627
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:15,460
Oh my god, it's like watching magic happening in front of me.

628
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,980
Why don't we upload...

629
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,560
Oh my god, you're looking up!

630
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,060
Like, it's super simple, mate.

631
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,460
Oh, that's so cool!

632
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,000
But if it works, it works.

633
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,600
Oh my god.

634
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:32,960
Wait, would the hair be a little bit more to the center if he looks down?

635
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,020
We can do that, right?

636
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:35,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

637
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,360
Yes.

638
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,480
A little bit rotational here.

639
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,560
So, maybe.

640
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,940
Oh my god.

641
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:48,100
Oh my god, that's so cool!

642
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:52,480
Oh my god!

643
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,540
Like, look.

644
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,840
Oh my god, look at you go!

645
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,000
This is so adorable.

646
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,220
Not gonna lie, it's cute.

647
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,160
Okay, of course we make the...

648
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,600
The chicken arms here.

649
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,540
We'll make two with the physics.

650
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:17,220
Oh my gosh, you did this so fast, guys.

651
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,080
That was like done in like...

652
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,060
In like five minutes.

653
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,060
Like, what the fuck?

654
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:28,440
I can't believe it's only like 30 minutes of rigging and also we were also very distracted on other stuff too.

655
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,780
These are things that happens.

656
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,500
Not gonna lie, always happens.

657
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,720
Oh wait, what the...

658
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,320
Oh my god, that's so cool.

659
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,080
Now he's moving his...

660
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,320
Like, he's looking down.

661
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,000
Look at him go.

662
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,440
Look at him, look at his stance up.

663
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,820
No, it's a weird...

664
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,140
This is a group effort, guys.

665
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,000
Giving him some...

666
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,520
Owl legs.

667
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,680
Like, imagine.

668
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,560
Or else, like...

669
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,080
Imagine.

670
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,420
No, no, no, not like that.

671
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,160
I think this looks fine so far.

672
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,000
Yeah, this looks fine.

673
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:11,520
Yeah, yeah.

674
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,600
Let's let us adding...

675
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,160
Adding more of his knees visible.

676
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,280
Oh my god, look at you go.

677
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,820
You're like...

678
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,760
Look at your stance, guys.

679
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,660
Wah, wah.

680
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,020
It's so...

681
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,120
It's so funny.

682
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,880
It's the squats and dragoons, come on.

683
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,440
The power stance right there.

684
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,300
He looks up to others.

685
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,500
Or down to others from his position.

686
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,860
Oh my god, look at him.

687
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,660
Oh my god, wait, and then...

688
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,480
Elongate the tail.

689
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,060
Oh my god, the two tails too.

690
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,640
And those possibilities.

691
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,300
What's up?

692
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,700
I'm the...

693
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,320
I am a good idea person, okay, guys?

694
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,980
I'm basically...

695
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,820
I'm basically like my idol, Thomas...

696
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,780
Thomas Edison.

697
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,640
Wait.

698
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,540
Is that his name?

699
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:21,080
So now, look how he looks, how...

700
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,680
This is already so squishy.

701
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,720
Oh my god, he's so squishy.

702
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,200
Oh my god, look at him.

703
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,200
It's so adorable.

704
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,280
Oh my god.

705
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,740
You know, you're like Tesla...

706
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,460
And I'm like Thomas Edison.

707
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,200
I need to...

708
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,220
I need to say something.

709
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:41,760
I'm...

710
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,800
Don't tell anyone.

711
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,380
This is our project that we made together.

712
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,720
We made this.

713
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:00,300
I'm so innocent, I don't know.

714
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,700
I'm special.

715
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:05,640
That's right, Tesla.

716
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,600
My mom tells me always I'm a special person.

717
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,160
That's right, Tesla.

718
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,260
You're very special.

719
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,620
Now, can you send that file to me while I claim...

720
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,620
Oh no, baby!

721
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,540
The copyright.

722
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,060
I'm a slow...

723
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,420
I'm a slow one.

724
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,880
Oopsie, oopsie, oopsie.

725
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,360
I'm not Tesla, I'm more cool.

726
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:39,860
You're more cool than Nikolas Tesla?

727
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,480
Oh man.

728
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,860
Rest in peace, Nikolas Tesla.

729
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,000
Oh my god.

730
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,680
Wait, can we like inflate the dragoon?

731
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:49,520
Yes.

732
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,640
Look at this.

733
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,600
And now he always gets this one.

734
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,220
No, okay, not like that.

735
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,140
No, no, no.

736
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,060
Wait, wait, wait.

737
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:58,760
That's like a toggle.

738
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,420
That's like a...

739
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:03,360
That's what toggle games like, to give him...

740
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,160
A real big brain.

741
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,620
Oh my god, wait!

742
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:10,000
There is so many possibilities here.

743
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,080
There's so many possibilities.

744
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,060
That's the issue of being a rigger.

745
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,780
There are so many possibilities.

746
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,560
Guys, if I learn how to do live 2D...

747
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,540
Imagine what I can do.

748
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,620
Imagine the power you would have.

749
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,960
Oh my god.

750
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:34,060
How do we inflate it?

751
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:39,500
I mean, what's also possible is to make like...

752
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:39,920
Wait a minute.

753
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,840
Long fail.

754
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,320
Oops, this is caps.

755
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,220
Long fails.

756
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:47,440
One.

757
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,320
Stop saying...

758
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:53,720
Okay, how do we make him fat?

759
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,140
I mean, this is also possible.

760
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,200
Oh my...

761
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,920
I was thinking now of making him real long.

762
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,840
Oh wait, no, that's great!

763
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,920
Wait, I love that!

764
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:08,880
Wait!

765
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,580
Hello.

766
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:17,120
Mama calls me her big boy.

767
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,160
Wait, wait, wait.

768
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,260
How does this end?

769
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,600
Oh my gosh, hello.

770
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:21,620
Wait, wait, wait.

771
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,040
Then we put the face up top.

772
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,300
Yes!

773
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,120
Wait a minute, I need to...

774
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,940
This is what I mean with...

775
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,160
Stop, stop, you are on the wrong layer.

776
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,260
I never choose a layer.

777
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,960
Long face.

778
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,520
Let's do this as a toggle and put up the...

779
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

780
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,380
Pants.

781
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:47,700
This is what happens when long goon and regular goon get married.

782
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,160
They create an abomination.

783
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,240
Then we...

784
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,240
Then you can look like...

785
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,020
Oh my god, wait, that's so good!

786
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,000
Wait.

787
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,420
Wait for his hair back up top.

788
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,280
Oh my god, can you push the yellow part to a higher note?

789
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,240
Which yellow part?

790
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,240
The white part, higher.

791
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:16,760
The white?

792
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,720
Of course we can.

793
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,140
Of course.

794
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:23,080
Mama cost me her special big boy.

795
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,960
Here we are.

796
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,480
Okay, what does that look like?

797
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,280
Actually, it's this way.

798
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,280
So now we have this one, then...

799
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,060
We have long face.

800
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,520
Oh my god, it's so good.

801
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,540
Motomoto likes you.

802
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,660
You look so funny too.

803
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,140
I'm so excited, and then...

804
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,800
He's very excited.

805
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,140
It's so funny.

806
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,360
That's so good.

807
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,280
That's so good, I love it.

808
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,520
I love it.

809
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,360
What else do we have to do here?

810
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,240
Okay, so now we can add...

811
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,360
Oh wait, first of all, we didn't finish the tail.

812
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,400
Oh true, we were so distracted with everything else.

813
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,920
I can't believe we forgot the tail.

814
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,900
How could this happen to us?

815
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:27,140
Poor tail.

816
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,560
Poor little tail.

817
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:33,880
Wow, I wonder how we forgot the tail, guys.

818
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,540
What could have caused us to forget about it?

819
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,320
When we get there, so now we have...

820
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,480
We can make the tail excited.

821
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,300
Here's the tail, wait, let's see.

822
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:49,100
So now if we, let me see if this works.

823
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:49,740
Alright.

824
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,000
Where is it?

825
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:53,480
Ah, here.

826
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,960
Tail excited, I need to choose the tail wag here.

827
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,620
So now we can see the tail wag.

828
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,500
Guys, don't worry, I did not forget the water balloons, I sent it over.

829
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,380
I sent the PNGs over.

830
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:12,580
Like now, if he's excited, we can make his tail more jiggly.

831
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:15,540
I just need to add more physics to it.

832
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,640
I love it, I love physics, guys.

833
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:21,160
Or we just add the tail.

834
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,480
Physics, body, y, x, y.

835
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,300
Physics is so fun.

836
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:31,660
Physics are the most funny thing alive to me, because you can just...

837
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:36,180
Like, let me show you, like, what happens if you push the physics way too far.

838
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,440
Oh, what?

839
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,180
What do you mean by that?

840
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,320
Like, he really jumps.

841
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,200
This is the maximum physics.

842
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,980
Like, okay, I could go even more, but...

843
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:49,460
You can see the difference from this to this.

844
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:54,180
And now, let me tell you, if you rig breasts, it can be very, very...

845
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,480
Special.

846
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,900
Like breasts flying above a whole screen.

847
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:58,740
Even more special?

848
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,020
Yes.

849
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,680
It can be dangerous.

850
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,200
Oh my god, oh my god, Dragoons, you can be even more special.

851
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:13,660
Like, with those balloons, we can make funny things to happen.

852
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,380
You see that?

853
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,440
She knows about the water balloons.

854
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:27,480
So, let me show you, like, now when the body moves, we can see this little, small...

855
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,620
Oh my god, look at you, you're animated.

856
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:30,560
That's so cute.

857
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,640
Oh my god, it's so cute!

858
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,180
And of course, we want this with those...

859
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:37,540
Arms.

860
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

861
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,880
Little arms.

862
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,120
Let me see, let me see.

863
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:50,480
Actually, we also can let them talk, by the way.

864
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,460
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

865
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,440
Yes, no, I love that!

866
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:57,020
No, no, no, it should be...

867
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,180
Like Canadians.

868
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,940
Wait, what's the other option?

869
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,680
What's the other one?

870
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,840
The other option would be more subtle, like the mouth, really.

871
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,340
Like, going...

872
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,640
Oh no, no, I like the first one.

873
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,660
I think, yeah, I think it's more funny to do...

874
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,260
Yeah, yeah.

875
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,840
With the Canadian dragons.

876
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,920
And then you make it like...

877
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,200
Like Canadians.

878
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,700
Oh my god.

879
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,280
Onto this.

880
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,760
So, like, it's so funny.

881
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,580
Oh my god.

882
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,620
We make it work, we make it nicely work.

883
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

884
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,720
So we add some arm physics.

885
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:40,520
Arm...

886
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,780
Arm, what?

887
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,200
One is enough.

888
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:51,820
Oh, I have arm physics already.

889
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,280
Wait a minute.

890
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,660
I got bamboozled!

891
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,880
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

892
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:05,320
So now we add some arm physics to make it even more cuter and jiggly.

893
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,400
Because it's important to have a jiggly fella.

894
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,700
Of course, jiggle physics is everything, guys.

895
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,000
It's everything.

896
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,300
Yeah, see?

897
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,940
I have jiggle physics too, guys.

898
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,900
Look at that.

899
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,980
So, we have...

900
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:29,940
Those little tiny arms.

901
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:30,940
Yeah.

902
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:35,020
So, like, we have one ear ready.

903
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,620
So let's arm arm.

904
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:40,540
We bet that for the left and right, those legs too and stuff.

905
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,420
So, let me add this on.

906
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:51,820
This is like the percentage of the effect of this you set up for the physics on each angle.

907
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:55,540
Like how much it's getting used, you can say.

908
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,760
Are you guys taking notes?

909
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,220
I'm saying uh-huh, but I'm not really understanding that much, but like uh-huh.

910
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,380
But you can see the jiggle.

911
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,480
So you put numbers in and then jiggle starts.

912
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:09,880
Yes.

913
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:10,540
Oh.

914
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,560
And if the jiggle happens, we are all happy.

915
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,420
Oh, I get it.

916
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,200
I understand now.

917
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,040
Are you sure?

918
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,520
Yeah, yeah.

919
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,780
Numbers in, jiggles up.

920
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:25,420
Exactly.

921
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:26,660
Yeah, yes.

922
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,340
Guys, see?

923
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,140
I can learn.

924
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,960
Guys, I get it.

925
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,360
I get it, guys.

926
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,800
So, we return this.

927
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:38,520
And now we add this part.

928
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,460
And this part.

929
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:42,780
And then we see...

930
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:49,000
Like now we have those small, tiny, fluffy physics.

931
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,240
Oh my god, look at you.

932
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,780
Isn't that cute?

933
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,080
That's so cute.

934
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,520
That's actually so cute.

935
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,420
Alright, should we do left and right now?

936
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,640
Or is there something else?

937
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:01,100
Yes.

938
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,660
Okay, so we know what we want for left and right.

939
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,140
You know that you want a butt?

940
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:11,480
Yeah, I want like one butt cheek showing at least.

941
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,700
Okay, okay, okay.

942
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:13,960
Okay.

943
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,700
Like, first of all, we add...

944
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:20,560
These angles.

945
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:24,620
And when we are done with the body angle, like...

946
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:25,860
Wait, can the tail...

947
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:28,740
Where is the tail?

948
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,820
I can't see the tail.

949
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:32,200
Where is the tail?

950
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,780
Oh no, she lost the tail.

951
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:39,300
Oh no, you can't get excited anymore, Draco.

952
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,840
She lost the tail.

953
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,380
What will she do?

954
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:46,800
Wait, so...

955
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,840
How will the dragoon get excited?

956
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,220
That's a very important question.

957
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,220
So, right now we have this here.

958
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,880
Actually, if we do this here right now...

959
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,920
One little part moves... Wait.

960
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:07,240
No, this needs to be lower.

961
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,560
You want that.

962
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,900
There's a little bit behind the other hair.

963
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:14,660
Yeah.

964
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,300
It's a hair thingy.

965
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:19,040
I don't know, like...

966
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:19,500
You know?

967
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:22,320
Wait, shouldn't it be like to the back when he turns?

968
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:23,520
Like the hair?

969
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:24,580
I think so, yes.

970
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,340
Like, here.

971
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,360
Shouldn't it move to the left side, the hair?

972
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,980
Because of like, perspective?

973
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,060
Actually, yes.

974
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:40,360
But with the round birdie object, it can be a little bit more stylized.

975
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:40,560
Oh, I see.

976
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,120
Okay, that's fine.

977
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,820
It's a very special bird.

978
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,080
Okay.

979
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,300
No way, that looks too weird.

980
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:55,220
Yeah, because right now, if we go logical on this one, it would go so much in the back.

981
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,840
It will look a little bit weird.

982
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,060
Actually, on a round object, it wouldn't move much.

983
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:01,600
It's a very special bird.

984
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:01,700
Weird.

985
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,180
That's what you say!

986
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:07,660
Not me.

987
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:11,460
Let's stop for a moment.

988
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,300
You agreed, you're part of the problem.

989
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:16,760
I'm not.

990
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,660
You're part of the problem, you're controlling it.

991
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,180
I mean, that's kind of true.

992
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:26,420
But look at him.

993
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:28,760
Oh my god, okay, that's cute.

994
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:29,760
That's cute.

995
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:30,780
I like that.

996
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:31,720
So...

997
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,380
Of course, we add this part here.

998
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:36,460
Oh my god.

999
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,020
Look at you go.

1000
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:39,920
Oh, wait.

1001
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:42,280
I can't wait for my favorite part, guys.

1002
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:48,520
I feel like your favorite part has something to do...

1003
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,080
This is my second favorite part.

1004
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:54,260
We haven't done my favorite part yet, guys.

1005
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:57,440
So...

1006
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,540
Of course, we switch the inner part to here.

1007
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,480
The white tummy part.

1008
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:08,640
Because the tummy part needs to be more round.

1009
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:15,840
And then we need to add the armys because right now they are stuck to their place.

1010
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,840
No one will stop me.

1011
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,260
This is for charity.

1012
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,080
You hate charity, guys?

1013
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,000
Wow, you want to stop charity?

1014
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,580
That's fucked.

1015
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,020
We have this here.

1016
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,200
Like now we can look...

1017
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:42,440
Like now we need to see how much we can connect those corners with each other to make it work.

1018
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,320
But it's simple because we have here a simple thing.

1019
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:49,340
It doesn't need to be...

1020
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:50,000
Wait.

1021
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:54,540
Let me see if we can get this behind a little bit.

1022
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,100
Oh, yeah.

1023
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:00,200
This is here in front still.

1024
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:09,310
And then this goes a little bit to the back.

1025
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:11,790
Because after a certain point...

1026
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:12,950
Yeah, they should go behind.

1027
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:13,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1028
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:15,050
Wait, what?

1029
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:20,310
Magic!

1030
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:24,110
Look at that go!

1031
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:29,450
Like now he can turn a tiny little bit.

1032
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:31,770
Oh my god, magic!

1033
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:33,770
Look at that!

1034
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:38,090
It still looks a little bit fake to the side here right now.

1035
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:39,250
Like it has...

1036
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:44,050
I'm so confused what I'm doing.

1037
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:45,490
I think you're doing great.

1038
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:47,910
In my head it looks great.

1039
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:54,830
You know, the thing with making subtitles is you do it again and again until you think it fits.

1040
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:56,510
It's the magic behind.

1041
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:58,770
Taking a lot of time.

1042
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:05,720
So we have just this part here.

1043
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,660
This will be covered.

1044
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:11,640
The weird movement of the hair will be covered with physics.

1045
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:13,220
You know, like...

1046
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:13,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1047
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,700
The tail goes wild.

1048
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:17,820
The tail goes vroom.

1049
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:19,340
Alright.

1050
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,680
It's so adorable.

1051
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:22,860
Yeah, it's so cute.

1052
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,260
Wait, shouldn't the other arm also move to the left too?

1053
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,220
To the side a little bit.

1054
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:30,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1055
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:36,520
I was thinking too, but I choose that this goes behind the body because it's already on the side here.

1056
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,360
And this is so, like, more near the face.

1057
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,840
So I thought if I go too far to the side it could look weird.

1058
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:43,920
Oh yeah, that's true.

1059
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,280
It'll be weird, yeah.

1060
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:46,240
Alright.

1061
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:49,260
This is what at least I was thinking right now.

1062
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,040
Now it actually looks good.

1063
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,060
That it might be a little bit far down.

1064
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:52,980
Yeah.

1065
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:54,380
Yeah.

1066
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:03,580
Sometimes it's a real tough decision what to do because sometimes it looks a little bit better if you do it a little bit style-wise.

1067
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:03,700
Yeah, yeah.

1068
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:09,920
And not like how it is meant to be in real life.

1069
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:18,340
So, let me add some physics on this part.

1070
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:22,840
My god, how... so many physics, guys.

1071
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:27,080
Yeah, and even... this is just a small part.

1072
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:32,060
Like, I don't add too many physics here because we want to keep it simple to finish it in one stream.

1073
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:39,800
But otherwise, like, the normal VTuber models, they have so many physics.

1074
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,440
Like, you can scroll so long on this parameter thing.

1075
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:49,380
Like, having 100, 200 parameters, just one model.

1076
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:52,840
Sounds not so much, but it is.

1077
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:53,740
Wait, how much is this?

1078
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:56,540
This one here?

1079
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:57,040
Yeah.

1080
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:58,840
Not much.

1081
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:01,440
Like, I don't have the body angles here.

1082
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:04,520
We have head angle X, Y, Z.

1083
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:05,980
I open, close.

1084
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:07,060
I smile or something.

1085
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,500
I could delete too because we don't need that.

1086
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,500
We can have eye physics added.

1087
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,840
I love the eye blinks.

1088
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:20,280
Like, how does this look?

1089
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,180
This is amazing.

1090
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:24,360
Beautiful.

1091
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:28,480
And then, beautiful movement.

1092
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,280
Guys, this was our idea, guys.

1093
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,440
You can tell this is... we did this together.

1094
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,980
You had the great ideas, right?

1095
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:42,180
Yeah.

1096
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,820
Wait, so how do we do the cheeks?

1097
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:45,440
The cheeks.

1098
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:51,200
So, whenever they turn around like this, let me try to get...

1099
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:57,840
This is a very spiky cheek like this, imagine.

1100
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,900
Oh my gosh.

1101
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:10,280
Oh, and then like a little... you can just do a little butt showing, like just a tiny little bump.

1102
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:15,800
Do you mean like in front, like here?

1103
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,140
Okay, so this is... Okay, I'm gonna do it on paint.

1104
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:26,260
Okay, so this is my vision on how I think we could do it.

1105
00:51:32,610 --> 00:51:34,590
Wait a minute, I need to turn.

1106
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:39,680
I wanna see what you're doing.

1107
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:47,700
Wait, wait, wait.

1108
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:48,440
I need to see.

1109
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,360
I'm drawing it on paint right now.

1110
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,820
This is my vision.

1111
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:56,320
I'm scared to see it.

1112
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,120
I'm so scared.

1113
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:00,700
Okay, okay, okay.

1114
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:01,440
Show me, show me.

1115
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:04,140
I posted it in the chat.

1116
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,760
This looks... special.

1117
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:12,900
Wait, wait.

1118
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:14,420
I think we can do it.

1119
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:17,020
I have an idea, I have an idea.

1120
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:18,340
Guys, this is what I sent.

1121
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:19,700
I'll show you guys what I sent here.

1122
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,180
I'll show you guys what I sent here.

1123
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,300
Let me add it.

1124
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:28,540
Let me open Photoshop so I can show you how...

1125
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:31,280
Not I can show you, I will add the butt cheek for it.

1126
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:32,700
Okay, nice.

1127
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:35,920
Okay, so guys, this is what I sent here.

1128
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:40,400
I was like, so this is my vision on how I think it could look like.

1129
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,360
And I sent you this.

1130
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,480
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1131
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,220
We are going to do this.

1132
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,700
Okay, so we have this one here.

1133
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,200
It almost looks like the model.

1134
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:04,560
That's what I'm saying.

1135
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:08,860
It almost looks just like it.

1136
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:11,860
So we want like...

1137
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:16,320
Oh my god, yes!

1138
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:22,790
We want another butt cheek like you have the butt crack here.

1139
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:24,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1140
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:26,210
Just a tiny one showing on the side.

1141
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:29,470
Okay, okay, I'll use this one and copy paste it for the side.

1142
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:30,430
Okay, but that's so tiny.

1143
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:31,670
It's got to be lumpier.

1144
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:34,370
Okay, okay, you want a big butt.

1145
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:35,250
Yeah, yeah.

1146
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:37,170
No, we want a big butt.

1147
00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:38,430
Imagine.

1148
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:40,870
Wait, wait, wait.

1149
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:43,070
That looks like he has something going on.

1150
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:45,490
Wait.

1151
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:49,190
Maybe like...

1152
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:51,970
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's good, that's good.

1153
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:52,830
That was good.

1154
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:55,970
No, no, no, just a little bit more.

1155
00:53:56,810 --> 00:53:57,570
No, that's too much.

1156
00:53:57,570 --> 00:53:58,290
Oh wait, this was too much?

1157
00:53:58,370 --> 00:53:58,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1158
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:00,310
Wait, wait, wait.

1159
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:02,210
No, no, wait, wait, wait.

1160
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:02,970
This one?

1161
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:05,050
I mean I can squish it to...

1162
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:07,830
And then we have like another butt showing up too.

1163
00:54:08,390 --> 00:54:10,810
So like, it looks like he has two butts.

1164
00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:15,390
So like, you know, he has two butts.

1165
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:16,250
Sorry, two butts.

1166
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:21,270
I want to ask right now why two butts?

1167
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:22,050
Okay.

1168
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:24,670
Wait, wait, wait.

1169
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:28,030
So then like the other butt is just like barely peeking, you know?

1170
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:30,690
Wait a minute.

1171
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:31,850
Yes, yes, yes.

1172
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:32,410
Wait.

1173
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:34,290
Yeah, yeah, you get it, you get it.

1174
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:35,710
Oh, yes!

1175
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:36,750
Yes!

1176
00:54:37,970 --> 00:54:38,870
Yes!

1177
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:40,910
We have a beautiful butt.

1178
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:41,610
Yes!

1179
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:42,930
Like he's turning.

1180
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:43,790
Yes!

1181
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:45,310
What are you looking for?

1182
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:47,630
Oh my god, yes.

1183
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:49,530
That's so good.

1184
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:55,770
The vision is there.

1185
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,050
It's there.

1186
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:02,090
It's so pretty, right?

1187
00:55:02,490 --> 00:55:03,650
It is so nice.

1188
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:06,110
Let's add those two butt cheeks here.

1189
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:06,510
Yes, it's beautiful.

1190
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:08,770
It looks just like my vision right here.

1191
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:12,130
It looks exactly like what I said, guys.

1192
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:16,630
So we have this one.

1193
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:19,950
And then we draw here the butt cheek out.

1194
00:55:20,170 --> 00:55:21,050
So we have...

1195
00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:22,570
What?

1196
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:26,970
Okay, and now we are going to export this beautiful butt cheeks.

1197
00:55:27,510 --> 00:55:27,730
Yeah.

1198
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:28,130
Into the model.

1199
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:29,390
There you go.

1200
00:55:29,450 --> 00:55:30,370
Guys, look at that.

1201
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:34,050
My vision was like... It was fucking perfect.

1202
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:37,770
Like what I drafted out to the real thing.

1203
00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:39,490
It looks... It's just one to one.

1204
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:42,630
It's exactly one to one.

1205
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:43,930
Dragoon butt cheeks.

1206
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:44,910
Oh, yeah.

1207
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:46,030
There we go.

1208
00:55:48,030 --> 00:55:48,990
Oh, true!

1209
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:51,090
We should add a little highlight to it.

1210
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:52,210
A little white shine.

1211
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:55,210
The white shine... Oh, no problem.

1212
00:55:55,330 --> 00:55:55,810
We can do it.

1213
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:56,850
Oh, yes!

1214
00:55:57,550 --> 00:56:00,430
Let's make the white shine to it.

1215
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:01,890
That's no problem.

1216
00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:04,470
Here we are.

1217
00:56:05,350 --> 00:56:05,990
Good ideas.

1218
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:07,550
There's no bad ideas, guys.

1219
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:11,770
Let's do this here.

1220
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:14,090
Oh, my gosh.

1221
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:15,190
Like...

1222
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:15,910
Look at this.

1223
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:17,210
Oh, my God!

1224
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:17,930
Yes!

1225
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:24,650
It should be both of them, right?

1226
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:26,730
Yes, yes.

1227
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:30,530
I have the shine separated, so the shine connects with the butt.

1228
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:33,350
It's super special.

1229
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:36,210
Save.

1230
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:38,770
Underneath this one.

1231
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:40,450
Then we save this one.

1232
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:41,930
This one.

1233
00:56:42,090 --> 00:56:43,650
And then we come...

1234
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:46,090
I have so many things here.

1235
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:46,450
Okay.

1236
00:56:46,830 --> 00:56:48,610
Dragoon butt cheeks.

1237
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:50,110
Oh, my God.

1238
00:56:51,290 --> 00:56:52,090
Here we are.

1239
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:53,290
We have the butt cheeks here.

1240
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:53,810
Oh, my God.

1241
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:55,150
It looks beautiful.

1242
00:56:55,930 --> 00:56:57,790
I'm so excited, guys.

1243
00:56:58,030 --> 00:57:00,990
I feel like... It looks like he's touching his...

1244
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:02,190
Oh, my God.

1245
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:02,330
Wait.

1246
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:03,910
He should... He's spanking his butt.

1247
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:04,990
Oh, my God.

1248
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:05,870
No, he should.

1249
00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:07,290
He should...

1250
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:11,170
You feel like... You see that?

1251
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:14,270
This is...

1252
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:18,550
Happy to be a Dragoon?

1253
00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:23,150
Oh, you better be happy with what I'm doing right now.

1254
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:26,230
It is so... Wait.

1255
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:27,490
Wait, wait, wait.

1256
00:57:27,790 --> 00:57:28,590
Do we have another one?

1257
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:29,390
That should be a toggle.

1258
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:31,970
You know, like those animations and stuff that you can do?

1259
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:36,630
There should be an animation where he just caresses his butt cheek.

1260
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:40,090
I think... Wait.

1261
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:41,790
Okay, now I have it.

1262
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:42,690
I was curious.

1263
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:44,910
Like having his...

1264
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:46,530
Yes!

1265
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:48,970
That should be... Can you add an animation for that?

1266
00:57:49,050 --> 00:57:49,930
Where he does that?

1267
00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:54,270
Can you add an animation for that?

1268
00:57:54,610 --> 00:57:57,830
Because I know some skin suits have animations.

1269
00:57:59,150 --> 00:57:59,630
Yes!

1270
00:58:02,990 --> 00:58:03,590
Okay.

1271
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:08,170
I was distracted for a bit.

1272
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:09,030
I was distracted.

1273
00:58:09,930 --> 00:58:11,490
Okay, don't get jealous.

1274
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:13,150
She's the one that's doing it.

1275
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:14,990
She's the... What do you mean?

1276
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:17,530
She's the one that's doing it.

1277
00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:18,930
I just smacked the cheek.

1278
00:58:19,010 --> 00:58:20,510
She fucking caressed it.

1279
00:58:23,850 --> 00:58:28,170
I need to... It was looking at me like it wanted to be you.

1280
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:28,890
Look at it.

1281
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:31,430
I've gone too far.

1282
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:33,030
This is a group effort.

1283
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:37,970
This is a group effort.

1284
00:58:37,970 --> 00:58:41,030
Imagine having those butt cheeks like...

1285
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:45,170
Like...

1286
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:46,110
No, okay.

1287
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:46,830
This needs to stop.

1288
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:48,650
Oh my gosh, this is too much.

1289
00:58:48,910 --> 00:58:51,490
What do you mean this is too much?

1290
00:58:52,190 --> 00:58:54,810
I mean, I was slapping his butt cheeks together.

1291
00:58:55,310 --> 00:58:56,570
I mean, that's fine.

1292
00:58:56,810 --> 00:59:00,310
Oh my gosh, imagine if you turn more... Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1293
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:01,190
I have the idea.

1294
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:03,730
She has more ideas.

1295
00:59:04,890 --> 00:59:09,370
So, right now the butt would be... I mean, logical would be here, but...

1296
00:59:10,190 --> 00:59:12,610
Let me have it here behind.

1297
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:15,150
Then...

1298
00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:15,790
Comes here.

1299
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:20,070
Wait, let me...

1300
00:59:20,530 --> 00:59:23,030
I think we need to make a toggle with this position.

1301
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:24,010
Oh, true.

1302
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:27,190
I think it could be weird from the moving...

1303
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:27,630
Yeah.

1304
00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:29,690
Like, to the moving one here.

1305
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:32,590
But, let's make it a toggle butt cheek toggle.

1306
00:59:32,890 --> 00:59:33,850
Oh, that's true.

1307
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:34,910
That's so true.

1308
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:36,870
A toggle just for the butt.

1309
00:59:37,270 --> 00:59:38,610
Oh, I like how you think.

1310
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:39,830
Then he...

1311
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:42,930
Wait, and then we make something like this with...

1312
00:59:45,050 --> 00:59:45,610
Chicken...

1313
00:59:47,070 --> 00:59:47,630
Arm...

1314
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:48,990
Butt touch cheek.

1315
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:52,710
So, we make an idle for it, then.

1316
00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:57,090
So, how do we want to have...

1317
00:59:57,090 --> 00:59:59,150
Like, we can make...

1318
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:02,310
Like, first of all...

1319
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:03,170
How would she get in trouble?

1320
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:04,710
It's a fucking chicken.

1321
01:00:06,310 --> 01:00:07,270
I don't...

1322
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:10,790
If Witcher or anything would do it, I mean, like...

1323
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:11,810
That would be weird.

1324
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:16,370
This chicken is a dragon.

1325
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:19,030
How would she get in trouble?

1326
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:23,550
I mean, actually, maybe I could be a little bit careful with...

1327
01:00:23,550 --> 01:00:24,590
No, no, no, that's...

1328
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:25,090
This one here?

1329
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:26,690
No, no, no, no, that's...

1330
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:29,250
I'm sorry.

1331
01:00:32,350 --> 01:00:34,350
That should be an animation.

1332
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:35,630
That should be an animation.

1333
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:37,310
That should be an animation.

1334
01:00:37,890 --> 01:00:38,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1335
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:42,390
I can't...

1336
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:44,050
This is so hilarious.

1337
01:00:44,890 --> 01:00:46,090
It's so hilarious.

1338
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:48,130
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1339
01:00:50,770 --> 01:00:51,470
But...

1340
01:00:51,470 --> 01:00:51,910
Let's see.

1341
01:00:52,610 --> 01:00:56,000
What has happened to us?

1342
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:57,890
You have become...

1343
01:00:57,890 --> 01:01:00,390
You have evolved to something even greater.

1344
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:02,550
Now...

1345
01:01:02,550 --> 01:01:04,110
We add the...

1346
01:01:04,110 --> 01:01:04,690
Butt...

1347
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:07,470
Appearing toggle.

1348
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:10,870
The butt appearing toggle.

1349
01:01:12,310 --> 01:01:14,230
I mean, what should I call it?

1350
01:01:14,310 --> 01:01:14,870
Like, butt toggle?

1351
01:01:15,010 --> 01:01:15,770
That's too boring.

1352
01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:17,630
Butt appears.

1353
01:01:18,610 --> 01:01:20,250
The butt jumps here.

1354
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:24,050
Wait, I have the idea what happens when...

1355
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:24,430
Oh, wait.

1356
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:25,410
We need to...

1357
01:01:25,410 --> 01:01:26,170
We were...

1358
01:01:26,170 --> 01:01:27,050
Reflect.

1359
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:29,070
Because right now I was doing this.

1360
01:01:29,670 --> 01:01:32,490
So now it appears and we won't have...

1361
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:34,510
Like...

1362
01:01:34,510 --> 01:01:36,570
Appearing out of nowhere.

1363
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:41,490
You just came back from butt implants, guys.

1364
01:01:42,350 --> 01:01:45,250
Welcome back, the surgery was a success.

1365
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:49,330
I have the idea.

1366
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:53,370
Oh my god.

1367
01:01:53,390 --> 01:01:54,630
Oh no, what if...

1368
01:01:54,630 --> 01:01:55,510
It was a success, guys.

1369
01:01:55,510 --> 01:01:56,190
Oh no, I have a...

1370
01:01:56,190 --> 01:01:58,230
I have a very evil idea.

1371
01:01:58,610 --> 01:01:59,290
Oh, nice.

1372
01:01:59,410 --> 01:02:00,530
I love your ideas.

1373
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:02,470
Oh no, I...

1374
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:03,490
I'm scared.

1375
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:04,650
I can't do this.

1376
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:06,470
I can't do this.

1377
01:02:14,790 --> 01:02:15,350
Okay.

1378
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:36,710
Guys, that wasn't me.

1379
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:38,950
That wasn't me!

1380
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:40,830
I can't...

1381
01:02:42,170 --> 01:02:44,030
Man, you are German.

1382
01:02:51,010 --> 01:02:55,590
After this idea, okay?

1383
01:02:56,130 --> 01:02:57,570
If no one would say it right...

1384
01:02:58,750 --> 01:03:01,370
Slap the butt or anything else.

1385
01:03:02,470 --> 01:03:03,430
Holy fuck.

1386
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:07,050
I can't do this at all.

1387
01:03:08,030 --> 01:03:09,670
I ghost right up to hell.

1388
01:03:09,670 --> 01:03:10,450
Fuck.

1389
01:03:12,210 --> 01:03:13,570
Oh my god.

1390
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:15,470
What do you mean, I did this?

1391
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:23,300
I did it also.

1392
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:26,290
I just...

1393
01:03:29,690 --> 01:03:31,090
I'm sweating so...

1394
01:03:31,090 --> 01:03:31,930
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1395
01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:37,270
Actually, I only wanted to rig as a toggle, like the butt comes out, okay?

1396
01:03:37,350 --> 01:03:39,450
This was my first intention.

1397
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:41,750
But then, it came to my mind...

1398
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:42,630
Wait a minute.

1399
01:03:43,070 --> 01:03:44,210
Wait a minute.

1400
01:03:44,210 --> 01:03:45,210
What if...

1401
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:47,850
Oh, yes, yes.

1402
01:03:48,010 --> 01:03:48,450
Sure.

1403
01:03:49,850 --> 01:03:52,690
I can't stop thinking of it anymore.

1404
01:03:53,610 --> 01:03:55,070
You're haunting my dreams.

1405
01:03:56,910 --> 01:03:58,750
Yeah, yeah, let's just say that.

1406
01:03:59,490 --> 01:04:00,910
Shame on me!

1407
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:03,750
I did not do anything there!

1408
01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:06,570
I just wanted butt cheeks, guys.

1409
01:04:06,690 --> 01:04:07,230
That's all.

1410
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:13,390
Okay, okay.

1411
01:04:13,390 --> 01:04:14,570
But where do we put the tail?

1412
01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:18,250
This is a good question.

1413
01:04:18,350 --> 01:04:19,390
What if we do it...

1414
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:20,210
Wait, wait.

1415
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:21,010
Should we put the tail?

1416
01:04:21,590 --> 01:04:22,010
Yeah, yeah.

1417
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:22,350
No, no.

1418
01:04:22,410 --> 01:04:23,090
We should put it...

1419
01:04:23,090 --> 01:04:26,210
It would float up, because he wants to show the assets, you know?

1420
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:28,510
And that looks very wrong.

1421
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:29,850
That looks...

1422
01:04:31,210 --> 01:04:33,710
It should like float up, because he's presenting it.

1423
01:04:35,610 --> 01:04:37,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1424
01:04:38,610 --> 01:04:39,330
Like this?

1425
01:04:39,850 --> 01:04:40,570
No, just...

1426
01:04:40,570 --> 01:04:41,430
No, stop.

1427
01:04:41,610 --> 01:04:42,830
No, no, no, no.

1428
01:04:42,830 --> 01:04:44,590
Especially when you elongate the tail.

1429
01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:46,250
We can't have the tail with the butt cheeks.

1430
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:47,710
Okay, okay.

1431
01:04:47,710 --> 01:04:51,290
So like, when the butt cheek shows up, the tail disappears.

1432
01:04:52,170 --> 01:04:52,350
Yes.

1433
01:04:52,510 --> 01:04:53,630
Can you attach the tail in the front?

1434
01:05:02,770 --> 01:05:03,670
It's getting...

1435
01:05:03,670 --> 01:05:07,190
It's getting very, very, very, very, very, very problematic.

1436
01:05:11,930 --> 01:05:12,370
Okay.

1437
01:05:13,030 --> 01:05:18,410
Okay, so when the butt cheeks comes out, the tail like gets absorbed, so the butt cheeks gets bigger.

1438
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:21,350
So like, that's why the tail's gone.

1439
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:23,890
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1440
01:05:23,890 --> 01:05:24,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1441
01:05:24,510 --> 01:05:26,230
It's transforming into the butt cheeks.

1442
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:26,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

1443
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:28,030
Yes, exactly.

1444
01:05:28,210 --> 01:05:30,050
That's the...

1445
01:05:30,050 --> 01:05:32,190
We chopped off this for the surgery.

1446
01:05:32,550 --> 01:05:37,190
For the surgery, to make it more cheeked up, we cut off the tail and used it as an implant.

1447
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:37,670
Oh, no.

1448
01:05:37,670 --> 01:05:39,950
The tail becomes the butt implants.

1449
01:05:41,430 --> 01:05:42,670
It's like Fullmetal Alchemist.

1450
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:45,570
Oh, yes!

1451
01:05:45,570 --> 01:05:47,150
Equal exchange, you know?

1452
01:05:49,350 --> 01:05:52,330
We Fullmetal Alchemist your tail into a butt cheek.

1453
01:05:54,830 --> 01:05:56,650
Fullmetal Alchemist, that's true, that's true.

1454
01:05:56,730 --> 01:05:57,830
I mean, it does work.

1455
01:05:58,170 --> 01:06:01,830
But, oh my gosh, my chat is like, Mimi gets a Twitch bot part 2.

1456
01:06:02,350 --> 01:06:06,150
Because I was getting a Twitch bot once when I was rigging.

1457
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:10,830
I think something slipped through.

1458
01:06:12,030 --> 01:06:14,670
Now I'm scared all the time whenever I'm rigging.

1459
01:06:16,810 --> 01:06:19,830
Oh my god, wait, can you do that?

1460
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:21,310
What?

1461
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:22,930
What do we do?

1462
01:06:23,290 --> 01:06:24,110
The jiggle of the butt.

1463
01:06:24,110 --> 01:06:26,090
Yeah, I'm adding the jiggles on the butt.

1464
01:06:26,110 --> 01:06:27,830
Oh my god, oh, it's perfect.

1465
01:06:32,050 --> 01:06:33,230
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1466
01:06:33,310 --> 01:06:35,010
We want to have a...

1467
01:06:35,010 --> 01:06:37,990
Not this one moves a little bit too much.

1468
01:06:38,130 --> 01:06:39,510
Maybe a little bit less.

1469
01:06:42,110 --> 01:06:44,330
Like one is moving more than the other.

1470
01:06:45,470 --> 01:06:47,410
Oh wait, now there's like...

1471
01:06:47,410 --> 01:06:48,870
What happened to...

1472
01:06:48,870 --> 01:06:50,350
Wait, wait, wait.

1473
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:52,450
There's still one butt cheek.

1474
01:06:55,270 --> 01:06:56,710
Oh my gosh, wait.

1475
01:06:57,270 --> 01:06:57,530
Okay.

1476
01:06:58,870 --> 01:07:01,250
Okay, okay, now we have...

1477
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:04,210
Okay, this one is a little bit buggy, but no problem, let's see.

1478
01:07:04,950 --> 01:07:06,110
And then, how do we...

1479
01:07:06,110 --> 01:07:08,790
Oh, now we will have butt cheeks physics whenever, wait.

1480
01:07:08,790 --> 01:07:10,970
Butt cheek physics.

1481
01:07:11,370 --> 01:07:12,750
Okay, how does it form?

1482
01:07:14,490 --> 01:07:15,730
Wait, wait, wait.

1483
01:07:15,850 --> 01:07:18,710
It will appear now in a second, like I just need to...

1484
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:23,730
I don't know where the arm is going.

1485
01:07:28,610 --> 01:07:30,990
The arm was searching for something.

1486
01:07:32,050 --> 01:07:33,550
He's like, where is it?

1487
01:07:36,030 --> 01:07:37,790
I can't, I'm dying.

1488
01:07:40,250 --> 01:07:43,510
There was a premature arm there, right there.

1489
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:45,210
He's like, where is it?

1490
01:07:47,550 --> 01:07:48,470
Oh, wait.

1491
01:07:49,610 --> 01:07:52,410
Like now, even if it appears atop this...

1492
01:07:53,090 --> 01:07:54,690
Oh wait, what happened to...

1493
01:07:54,690 --> 01:07:56,450
Wait, wait, what's going on with the butt?

1494
01:07:58,390 --> 01:07:59,510
Like, imagine...

1495
01:07:59,510 --> 01:08:00,150
It appears...

1496
01:08:01,030 --> 01:08:03,070
Oh my god, look at the jiggle on the butt!

1497
01:08:04,290 --> 01:08:06,310
Oh my god, look at the pierce!

1498
01:08:06,310 --> 01:08:07,370
That's so nice.

1499
01:08:12,770 --> 01:08:14,210
I'm just crying.

1500
01:08:15,430 --> 01:08:21,530
And now we need to edit the angles to the butt.

1501
01:08:22,050 --> 01:08:22,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1502
01:08:22,790 --> 01:08:24,750
Body Y angle.

1503
01:08:24,930 --> 01:08:28,050
I forgot about my T, guys, so don't be...

1504
01:08:28,050 --> 01:08:29,330
Oh, you should get your T!

1505
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:31,410
Yeah, yeah, you keep rigging, I'll be right back.

1506
01:08:31,890 --> 01:08:32,330
Okay.

1507
01:08:33,430 --> 01:08:34,750
Okay, chat, we are alone.

1508
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:37,970
No one saw my butt thing, right?

1509
01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:40,290
That's good, no one saw that.

1510
01:08:46,190 --> 01:08:48,910
I'm scared Twitch is not going to ban me, right?

1511
01:08:49,390 --> 01:08:49,830
Builders?

1512
01:08:49,950 --> 01:08:50,610
I hope not.

1513
01:08:50,950 --> 01:08:51,430
Imagine.

1514
01:08:52,190 --> 01:08:53,010
Yeah, only...

1515
01:08:53,010 --> 01:08:54,170
This is a chicken's butt.

1516
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:55,730
I think this is safe to go.

1517
01:08:56,190 --> 01:08:57,510
This is safe to go.

1518
01:08:57,630 --> 01:08:58,430
Chicken butt.

1519
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:04,020
Oh, I'm dying.

1520
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:10,840
If someone would have told me, like, I would rig a chicken's butt in two years...

1521
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:12,960
Never I would have imagined I would do it.

1522
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,860
I can't save anyone from you.

1523
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:18,500
I want to rig those butt cheeks.

1524
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:19,620
They are so funny.

1525
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,920
I really love Curse rigging things.

1526
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:24,700
Not gonna lie, they're so funny.

1527
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:27,300
I really love that.

1528
01:09:29,980 --> 01:09:32,000
Life is very strange.

1529
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:32,660
YouTube save.

1530
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:34,460
Yeah, that's actually true.

1531
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:37,580
YouTube save, but Twitch can't be a real meanie.

1532
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:41,840
Twitch doesn't like...

1533
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:44,080
butt physics.

1534
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:50,680
She can't be stopped anymore, even without talking.

1535
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:51,660
No, never.

1536
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:57,040
And every one of you can have fun with those, with this little feller.

1537
01:09:58,320 --> 01:09:58,880
Like...

1538
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:01,060
Imagine having...

1539
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:02,960
Oops, I always put the...

1540
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:04,680
Like...

1541
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:06,280
We only need to connect the butt.

1542
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:08,980
And it will be so funny.

1543
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:12,220
Ah, wait.

1544
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:12,920
Wait.

1545
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:16,880
Wait a minute, we need to connect the leggies to it.

1546
01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:24,080
We want to have them connected to the chicken.

1547
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:28,280
And...

1548
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:29,100
Like this.

1549
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:32,980
We can add the...

1550
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:34,420
Chicken butt.

1551
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:35,920
What I need to see...

1552
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:36,160
Oh my god.

1553
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:37,540
Look at him go.

1554
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:39,620
Yes.

1555
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,960
What the fuck is wrong with the butt?

1556
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:47,820
It comes up.

1557
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:54,260
Oh my god, he's a freak.

1558
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:02,080
Look at this.

1559
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:05,880
Oh, we need to fix the arm here, you know.

1560
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:09,820
It's not...

1561
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:12,140
It's not doing anything saucy, okay?

1562
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:15,420
Oh my god, he's beautiful.

1563
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,860
My little freaking boy.

1564
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:20,480
Like, look at this now here.

1565
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:22,800
This is the base we have so far.

1566
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:24,620
Yeah, but his tail is gone.

1567
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:31,760
Yeah, right now because I'm scared of what's happening right now when the butt is activated.

1568
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:34,680
And then here...

1569
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:35,860
We need to...

1570
01:11:35,860 --> 01:11:38,060
We need to change how the butt works right.

1571
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,780
Right now it looks like the...

1572
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:42,960
Dragon is moving, but without the...

1573
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,880
But his butt stays on the same.

1574
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:46,540
I like how, like...

1575
01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:50,680
The butt physics is, like, so much more advanced than any...

1576
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:53,320
Anything else.

1577
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:56,800
It's a special...

1578
01:11:58,400 --> 01:11:59,920
Wait, wait, what if I...

1579
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:01,060
Wait.

1580
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:04,080
Okay, right now this works.

1581
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,260
And now we can...

1582
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:07,280
No, I always...

1583
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:11,100
So, and then we add...

1584
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:12,520
I think, like this.

1585
01:12:12,940 --> 01:12:15,880
I mean, it looks still wrong, but I think it will work out.

1586
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:16,980
At least it has a butt.

1587
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:18,220
We should be thankful.

1588
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:19,880
You should be thankful.

1589
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:22,280
Guys, the surgery might not be a success.

1590
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,420
We put it in the wrong area.

1591
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:31,580
Just a tiny bit, but at least it's there.

1592
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:33,440
At least it's there.

1593
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:35,280
That's the most important thing.

1594
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:36,600
Sorry, the surgery...

1595
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:38,980
We might have botched the surgery a little bit.

1596
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:40,860
But at least it looks good.

1597
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:44,200
At least the jiggle is there.

1598
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:47,960
What's happening there?

1599
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:48,860
I have no idea.

1600
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:54,400
It has a very...

1601
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:55,140
Actually, wait.

1602
01:12:55,860 --> 01:12:59,000
It wasn't as equivalent as the exchange as it was.

1603
01:12:59,140 --> 01:13:00,220
I have no idea.

1604
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:02,740
At least I want my tail back.

1605
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:07,380
Guys, this is better than a tail.

1606
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:08,240
What do you mean?

1607
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:11,500
Guys, no.

1608
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,800
Don't sue for medical malpractice, guys.

1609
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:14,900
I think...

1610
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:15,540
Okay, look.

1611
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:17,780
Even though it was placed wrong...

1612
01:13:17,780 --> 01:13:18,440
It still...

1613
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:19,800
At least it looks good.

1614
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:23,280
What if we have it like this now?

1615
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:25,380
Now, it's wrongly placed.

1616
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:28,200
But it has always the butt with the toggle.

1617
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:31,480
As long as, you know...

1618
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:31,560
It's fine.

1619
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:36,220
The butt is a little bit wrong.

1620
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:37,060
Why is it...

1621
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:40,420
Can we not make it disappear when he's facing in the front?

1622
01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:42,200
I was gonna say like...

1623
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:43,740
Are we gonna move it to the front?

1624
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:46,700
Wait, is that TOS if we move that to the front?

1625
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:49,720
I would be scared.

1626
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,360
Imagine getting banned for that.

1627
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:57,060
Banned because of a chicken butt.

1628
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,660
Could be me, I swear.

1629
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,180
My luck would be like this.

1630
01:14:04,820 --> 01:14:07,400
Okay, like...

1631
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:08,160
Okay.

1632
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:10,620
This is going to be the worst.

1633
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:16,360
My butt's up here.

1634
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:21,360
Oh no, I have so many of them.

1635
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:22,260
Yeah, like...

1636
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:24,900
When it's over there, I think the butt shouldn't be showing.

1637
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:27,140
Can I have it here?

1638
01:14:27,940 --> 01:14:30,700
But this is going to be so hard to have it here.

1639
01:14:37,610 --> 01:14:41,670
The butt comes out from nowhere from the back and the front.

1640
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:42,810
Hello, here I am.

1641
01:14:43,110 --> 01:14:43,790
I just...

1642
01:14:43,790 --> 01:14:45,450
I want to be here too.

1643
01:14:46,490 --> 01:14:46,750
Hello.

1644
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:51,160
I'm here.

1645
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:54,280
I see double chin.

1646
01:14:54,660 --> 01:14:55,200
Oh no.

1647
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:57,040
It's coming out.

1648
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:57,460
Can we...

1649
01:14:57,460 --> 01:15:00,620
Can we get them to work with this part of it?

1650
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:02,440
Just curious.

1651
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:05,300
This is the most time we spent on the rigging part, by the way.

1652
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:07,180
The butt has taken most of our time.

1653
01:15:07,940 --> 01:15:09,740
It's the most important part.

1654
01:15:16,050 --> 01:15:20,290
This is absolutely the most important part of rigging.

1655
01:15:20,410 --> 01:15:21,570
You think about this.

1656
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:23,230
Oh my god, wait.

1657
01:15:24,970 --> 01:15:26,610
Wait, yeah, yeah, wait, wait, wait.

1658
01:15:27,390 --> 01:15:28,710
Wait, wait.

1659
01:15:28,770 --> 01:15:29,990
Further down, further down.

1660
01:15:30,150 --> 01:15:31,410
No, it should be further down.

1661
01:15:33,770 --> 01:15:34,550
No, no, no.

1662
01:15:34,590 --> 01:15:35,630
Oh my god.

1663
01:15:35,690 --> 01:15:36,950
The double chin.

1664
01:15:37,170 --> 01:15:38,610
Oh, you're...

1665
01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:45,290
Yeah, yeah.

1666
01:15:45,490 --> 01:15:46,550
And then...

1667
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:48,530
Wait, remove the last one.

1668
01:15:48,730 --> 01:15:49,850
Remove the second one.

1669
01:15:50,570 --> 01:15:51,130
This one?

1670
01:15:51,390 --> 01:15:51,970
Yeah, yeah.

1671
01:15:52,170 --> 01:15:55,490
And then, can you make the line to the left just...

1672
01:16:03,330 --> 01:16:04,490
This was your chat.

1673
01:16:04,590 --> 01:16:05,530
This is not on me.

1674
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:09,970
Wait, can you give him eye bags?

1675
01:16:10,430 --> 01:16:11,590
Can you give him eye bags?

1676
01:16:11,690 --> 01:16:12,330
Oh, eye bags.

1677
01:16:12,470 --> 01:16:13,070
Let me see.

1678
01:16:13,290 --> 01:16:13,670
Like...

1679
01:16:13,670 --> 01:16:15,170
I mean, this is like...

1680
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:16,290
Like, if we can...

1681
01:16:16,290 --> 01:16:16,790
Wait a minute.

1682
01:16:25,740 --> 01:16:28,460
Okay, but then darken the bags a little bit.

1683
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:30,360
Let me see.

1684
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:32,480
Let me see if it's possible.

1685
01:16:33,140 --> 01:16:34,040
I think I did good.

1686
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:36,120
Yeah, yeah.

1687
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:37,360
Keep darkening a little bit.

1688
01:16:38,780 --> 01:16:42,220
A little bit more to this color.

1689
01:16:42,980 --> 01:16:47,300
I mean, let me make the line here a little bit more rounded for this part.

1690
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:54,600
Oh my god!

1691
01:16:59,030 --> 01:17:00,510
This is really depressing.

1692
01:17:03,310 --> 01:17:04,170
Okay.

1693
01:17:05,950 --> 01:17:07,110
Here we go.

1694
01:17:07,230 --> 01:17:07,510
Here we are.

1695
01:17:08,650 --> 01:17:12,190
This impression has gone too far.

1696
01:17:13,790 --> 01:17:14,790
Oh, then we have...

1697
01:17:18,420 --> 01:17:19,670
What the fuck?

1698
01:17:19,770 --> 01:17:20,570
What was that?

1699
01:17:20,910 --> 01:17:21,820
You just like...

1700
01:17:22,710 --> 01:17:24,010
What was that?

1701
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:29,110
Maybe I've rigged everything on the butt.

1702
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:32,190
What?

1703
01:17:32,190 --> 01:17:34,150
But this looks very wrong, like...

1704
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:42,330
This is how your boobs would have been.

1705
01:17:46,490 --> 01:17:47,670
You should keep that.

1706
01:17:47,770 --> 01:17:48,670
No, you should keep that.

1707
01:17:48,750 --> 01:17:49,190
That's good.

1708
01:17:49,690 --> 01:17:51,770
I can keep that, but after stream.

1709
01:17:51,890 --> 01:17:53,450
Because I know for sure if it's...

1710
01:17:53,450 --> 01:17:56,970
If it's looking like a boob, but just a little tiny bit.

1711
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:01,350
But this is...

1712
01:18:02,530 --> 01:18:03,150
That's great.

1713
01:18:03,430 --> 01:18:03,750
Special.

1714
01:18:04,690 --> 01:18:05,250
Okay, okay.

1715
01:18:05,390 --> 01:18:07,850
So, what else do we have to do?

1716
01:18:09,150 --> 01:18:12,110
We could add now physics to the...

1717
01:18:12,810 --> 01:18:14,530
Of course, to the double cheeks.

1718
01:18:14,610 --> 01:18:15,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1719
01:18:15,790 --> 01:18:17,130
Well, first of all, the hair.

1720
01:18:17,430 --> 01:18:18,410
Let's add the hair.

1721
01:18:18,730 --> 01:18:20,770
Only happy little accidents, guys.

1722
01:18:21,570 --> 01:18:23,330
Wait, what the fuck happened?

1723
01:18:23,330 --> 01:18:23,950
What happened?

1724
01:18:26,550 --> 01:18:28,730
Butt cheeks are making a dance party.

1725
01:18:29,170 --> 01:18:30,330
Oh my god.

1726
01:18:32,510 --> 01:18:36,330
These are things that can help very easily if you...

1727
01:18:38,690 --> 01:18:40,270
Not undo the params.

1728
01:18:40,450 --> 01:18:41,570
Like, now it's working, like...

1729
01:18:41,570 --> 01:18:42,210
Okay, okay.

1730
01:18:42,270 --> 01:18:43,650
I was like, what happened?

1731
01:18:43,890 --> 01:18:45,190
Oh, you look so depressed.

1732
01:18:46,550 --> 01:18:48,030
You look so sad.

1733
01:18:48,410 --> 01:18:49,910
No, don't be sad.

1734
01:18:50,110 --> 01:18:50,930
Turn to the left.

1735
01:18:51,130 --> 01:18:52,330
Don't be sad when you turn...

1736
01:18:52,330 --> 01:18:55,730
Wait, wait, when you turn to the left, you won't be sad anymore.

1737
01:18:56,950 --> 01:18:58,570
Oh, you gotta fix that.

1738
01:18:58,790 --> 01:18:59,730
You gotta fix that.

1739
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:04,530
Wait, wait, we make the butt disappear.

1740
01:19:04,790 --> 01:19:07,530
But let me add the toggle for the chin.

1741
01:19:08,530 --> 01:19:09,650
Extra chin.

1742
01:19:10,790 --> 01:19:13,030
No, you guys look beautiful.

1743
01:19:14,110 --> 01:19:16,230
You guys look so beautiful.

1744
01:19:16,670 --> 01:19:18,350
The sad twerking.

1745
01:19:19,690 --> 01:19:22,620
I was starting with this being like...

1746
01:19:23,110 --> 01:19:26,290
Like a special gift for the community.

1747
01:19:26,490 --> 01:19:27,230
And now, what have I done?

1748
01:19:27,230 --> 01:19:28,290
It is so special.

1749
01:19:28,290 --> 01:19:29,330
What have I done?

1750
01:19:29,370 --> 01:19:30,810
It's so special.

1751
01:19:31,250 --> 01:19:33,030
I think they love it.

1752
01:19:33,590 --> 01:19:35,350
The saggy is a dragoon.

1753
01:19:36,990 --> 01:19:38,310
Depressed dragoon.

1754
01:19:39,850 --> 01:19:40,950
Here we are.

1755
01:19:41,290 --> 01:19:43,570
This cake is all I have.

1756
01:19:47,210 --> 01:19:48,350
No, we delete.

1757
01:19:48,610 --> 01:19:49,490
Oh, like we have the Ivex toggle.

1758
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:51,070
You guys look so cool.

1759
01:19:51,310 --> 01:19:52,010
What do you mean?

1760
01:19:55,570 --> 01:19:58,470
For the extra chin toggle, we can make it more...

1761
01:19:58,470 --> 01:20:00,210
More funny appearing.

1762
01:20:00,530 --> 01:20:02,090
Like coming out here.

1763
01:20:03,830 --> 01:20:06,450
And then it appears like...

1764
01:20:06,450 --> 01:20:06,990
Like this.

1765
01:20:07,030 --> 01:20:08,230
It looks a little bit...

1766
01:20:08,230 --> 01:20:09,830
Like it's just growing.

1767
01:20:12,490 --> 01:20:13,490
It's good.

1768
01:20:13,490 --> 01:20:14,710
I love it.

1769
01:20:16,470 --> 01:20:17,790
It's so special.

1770
01:20:18,250 --> 01:20:19,370
It's so special.

1771
01:20:19,990 --> 01:20:21,150
Oh, wait.

1772
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:23,970
Yeah, we have the arm jiggles.

1773
01:20:24,230 --> 01:20:27,530
Let me add this with the upper part here.

1774
01:20:32,650 --> 01:20:33,790
This one.

1775
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:38,050
Let me connect those lines because it looks weird.

1776
01:20:44,970 --> 01:20:46,990
And let me see how it looks.

1777
01:20:46,990 --> 01:20:48,650
I always check out...

1778
01:20:48,650 --> 01:20:49,450
Like, look at this.

1779
01:20:49,890 --> 01:20:51,170
Look, this looks so squishy.

1780
01:20:51,950 --> 01:20:53,050
It's so squishy.

1781
01:20:53,830 --> 01:20:55,330
See, look at that, guys.

1782
01:20:55,430 --> 01:20:56,230
You look beautiful.

1783
01:20:57,430 --> 01:20:57,890
See?

1784
01:20:59,630 --> 01:21:01,050
Just trust the process.

1785
01:21:01,330 --> 01:21:03,150
Yeah, trust the process, guys.

1786
01:21:03,270 --> 01:21:03,950
Look at that.

1787
01:21:04,010 --> 01:21:04,810
It's beautiful.

1788
01:21:06,590 --> 01:21:06,970
I know.

1789
01:21:07,090 --> 01:21:12,230
It looks so cute.

1790
01:21:12,230 --> 01:21:17,250
And now what we can do is like making an eye animation.

1791
01:21:22,150 --> 01:21:25,090
I need to save my model before...

1792
01:21:25,090 --> 01:21:25,890
Oh yeah, true.

1793
01:21:26,150 --> 01:21:28,670
It would suck if we just lost everything.

1794
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:31,010
After everything we went through.

1795
01:21:31,090 --> 01:21:31,630
Imagine.

1796
01:21:31,910 --> 01:21:33,510
No, this would be so sad.

1797
01:21:33,890 --> 01:21:34,770
So, here we are.

1798
01:21:35,050 --> 01:21:37,050
We add the eye animation.

1799
01:21:37,330 --> 01:21:39,070
That is the animation for the eyes.

1800
01:21:39,070 --> 01:21:42,250
Now, that makes it like open.

1801
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:42,930
Wait, wait, wait.

1802
01:21:42,950 --> 01:21:43,450
Are you done?

1803
01:21:44,710 --> 01:21:46,670
For the base settings, yes.

1804
01:21:46,970 --> 01:21:47,270
Wait, no.

1805
01:21:48,370 --> 01:21:50,030
We didn't add water balloons.

1806
01:21:50,830 --> 01:21:51,210
Yes, yes.

1807
01:21:51,210 --> 01:21:51,590
Don't worry.

1808
01:21:51,730 --> 01:21:52,810
We wanna add them.

1809
01:21:52,990 --> 01:21:53,470
We will add them.

1810
01:21:53,530 --> 01:21:57,810
I just gotta be sure that we remember the most important part.

1811
01:21:58,010 --> 01:22:01,930
I just need to be sure we remember the most important part of this entire project.

1812
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:02,970
This is very important.

1813
01:22:03,850 --> 01:22:07,110
Let me save them here.

1814
01:22:07,510 --> 01:22:08,510
I can add them.

1815
01:22:08,510 --> 01:22:11,010
But just let me do one thing.

1816
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:17,050
I want to add the idol for it.

1817
01:22:19,050 --> 01:22:22,510
Because I want to have the idol for it, like...

1818
01:22:23,850 --> 01:22:24,190
Here?

1819
01:22:29,630 --> 01:22:32,270
Having it a little bit...

1820
01:22:32,270 --> 01:22:34,850
You should like, unsync his play so it's like...

1821
01:22:34,850 --> 01:22:36,250
Yes, yes.

1822
01:22:36,250 --> 01:22:38,170
Yeah, yeah, so one eye first.

1823
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:40,570
Yes, you know exactly what I mean.

1824
01:22:43,090 --> 01:22:43,690
Then...

1825
01:22:44,090 --> 01:22:45,570
We open this one up.

1826
01:22:46,350 --> 01:22:48,970
We wait with the other one a tiny little bit.

1827
01:22:49,170 --> 01:22:50,870
Open it up.

1828
01:22:51,590 --> 01:22:53,130
So, let me see.

1829
01:22:57,650 --> 01:22:59,170
We just add this.

1830
01:23:00,450 --> 01:23:04,950
And now, we are going to add the balloons.

1831
01:23:05,650 --> 01:23:06,130
Yes.

1832
01:23:06,470 --> 01:23:08,770
Oh, you see the balloons I sent you?

1833
01:23:09,530 --> 01:23:10,950
Yes, I downloaded them.

1834
01:23:14,350 --> 01:23:18,290
Good thing is, I can just import it here.

1835
01:23:19,770 --> 01:23:20,670
As new art mesh.

1836
01:23:22,510 --> 01:23:23,470
Yeah, so...

1837
01:23:23,470 --> 01:23:26,870
So, we can make it smaller or squish it a little bit.

1838
01:23:27,350 --> 01:23:28,290
If needed to be.

1839
01:23:28,490 --> 01:23:28,950
And then...

1840
01:23:28,950 --> 01:23:29,770
And then...

1841
01:23:32,790 --> 01:23:34,530
Oh my god, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1842
01:23:34,630 --> 01:23:35,670
Is that bannable?

1843
01:23:35,950 --> 01:23:36,630
When you...

1844
01:23:36,630 --> 01:23:39,850
There should be a toggle where it just spawns in when you're teabagging.

1845
01:23:40,590 --> 01:23:41,650
Oh my gosh!

1846
01:23:42,070 --> 01:23:42,870
No, I would...

1847
01:23:42,870 --> 01:23:44,110
No, I wouldn't do that.

1848
01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:44,910
Okay, okay.

1849
01:23:44,910 --> 01:23:46,170
I can edit for you.

1850
01:23:46,250 --> 01:23:46,650
Don't...

1851
01:23:46,650 --> 01:23:47,250
No problem.

1852
01:23:47,370 --> 01:23:48,570
I can edit for you.

1853
01:23:49,170 --> 01:23:49,610
But...

1854
01:23:49,610 --> 01:23:51,850
Doing that on stream can be...

1855
01:23:56,290 --> 01:23:57,190
Okay, okay.

1856
01:23:57,290 --> 01:23:57,950
And then...

1857
01:23:57,950 --> 01:24:01,050
Do you think you can add jiggle fixes on a PNG?

1858
01:24:01,890 --> 01:24:03,550
Of course I can.

1859
01:24:03,670 --> 01:24:04,230
I can't...

1860
01:24:04,230 --> 01:24:06,950
I can't have, like, different...

1861
01:24:06,950 --> 01:24:08,150
But we can do something.

1862
01:24:08,290 --> 01:24:08,930
Let me try.

1863
01:24:09,150 --> 01:24:10,390
Let me try some...

1864
01:24:10,390 --> 01:24:13,250
Or we can create our own water balloon and just copy the design.

1865
01:24:14,350 --> 01:24:14,670
Oh, wait.

1866
01:24:14,730 --> 01:24:16,350
I have the idea of ideas.

1867
01:24:16,530 --> 01:24:16,670
Wait.

1868
01:24:16,910 --> 01:24:17,950
Delete this here.

1869
01:24:18,370 --> 01:24:20,950
I add them in Photoshop and this just...

1870
01:24:21,790 --> 01:24:25,350
Put them into blue balloon and...

1871
01:24:25,350 --> 01:24:25,870
Water balloon.

1872
01:24:25,870 --> 01:24:26,690
Or just...

1873
01:24:27,870 --> 01:24:28,830
That's perfect.

1874
01:24:29,710 --> 01:24:31,170
We can do it.

1875
01:24:32,050 --> 01:24:33,470
As nothing is impossible.

1876
01:24:33,790 --> 01:24:35,010
Imagine that then for cheap bagging.

1877
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:38,770
I can't get those out of my head.

1878
01:24:38,830 --> 01:24:39,470
I will do that.

1879
01:24:39,890 --> 01:24:40,750
I need to do it later.

1880
01:24:40,930 --> 01:24:41,490
It's so funny.

1881
01:24:48,350 --> 01:24:51,430
So, what I'm having here right now is...

1882
01:24:52,010 --> 01:24:52,490
Balloons.

1883
01:24:54,230 --> 01:24:55,110
I'm going to cut them.

1884
01:24:55,110 --> 01:24:57,770
They are very simple, so...

1885
01:24:57,770 --> 01:25:00,210
I hope it will be relatively fast.

1886
01:25:00,950 --> 01:25:01,490
Wait still.

1887
01:25:01,670 --> 01:25:03,670
I don't use Photoshop so often.

1888
01:25:04,610 --> 01:25:07,070
Where is my magic tool?

1889
01:25:08,750 --> 01:25:08,970
Here.

1890
01:25:09,610 --> 01:25:10,250
My...

1891
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:10,590
This one.

1892
01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:18,730
We are going to erase this part here.

1893
01:25:19,710 --> 01:25:21,110
So we have the...

1894
01:25:21,630 --> 01:25:22,550
Oh, just the blue?

1895
01:25:23,210 --> 01:25:25,730
And I will use the blue one.

1896
01:25:25,950 --> 01:25:28,530
Copy-paste it and make it in a different color.

1897
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:29,850
Because then it will work too.

1898
01:25:30,010 --> 01:25:31,110
Because then we have two balloons.

1899
01:25:31,110 --> 01:25:31,830
That's true.

1900
01:25:33,290 --> 01:25:34,090
It's super easy.

1901
01:25:34,110 --> 01:25:34,790
Oh, she's cooking.

1902
01:25:34,950 --> 01:25:35,810
She's cooking, guys.

1903
01:25:36,370 --> 01:25:37,070
This is her idea.

1904
01:25:37,250 --> 01:25:39,050
Remember, this is her...

1905
01:25:40,630 --> 01:25:42,370
Remember, this is her idea.

1906
01:25:45,710 --> 01:25:47,990
I mean, I had some questionable ideas.

1907
01:25:48,410 --> 01:25:49,810
But that's not...

1908
01:25:49,810 --> 01:25:51,090
I'm innocent in this one.

1909
01:25:52,970 --> 01:25:54,550
And now we copy...

1910
01:25:55,110 --> 01:25:55,850
Not this one.

1911
01:25:57,130 --> 01:25:58,570
Copy-paste this one.

1912
01:25:59,950 --> 01:26:01,790
And have it in a different color.

1913
01:26:01,950 --> 01:26:03,850
Which one do we like to get?

1914
01:26:04,670 --> 01:26:05,950
I think orange was good.

1915
01:26:06,370 --> 01:26:07,710
I think orange was really good.

1916
01:26:09,030 --> 01:26:11,430
Let me get something similar to orange.

1917
01:26:13,510 --> 01:26:14,730
I'm not so good with...

1918
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:21,810
Let me try this.

1919
01:26:21,910 --> 01:26:25,010
And then we get some colors on there.

1920
01:26:28,510 --> 01:26:29,150
Like...

1921
01:26:29,150 --> 01:26:31,430
Then we get some saturation.

1922
01:26:33,470 --> 01:26:36,510
I'm just trying to get near this.

1923
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:47,500
Oh, wait.

1924
01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:48,720
I can do it like this.

1925
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:49,440
Wait.

1926
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:54,460
We take the exact color from this one, actually.

1927
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:57,200
And put it in here.

1928
01:26:59,220 --> 01:26:59,800
She's cooking.

1929
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:02,080
Then we take this one.

1930
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:04,560
Put it in here.

1931
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:07,200
And we take this one.

1932
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:12,000
So, okay.

1933
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:13,000
We have it.

1934
01:27:13,540 --> 01:27:14,340
Okay, we are done.

1935
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:15,960
We're adding this one now.

1936
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:17,500
As a PSD.

1937
01:27:17,740 --> 01:27:19,520
And we have our balloons ready.

1938
01:27:20,020 --> 01:27:22,020
And left and right separated, actually.

1939
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:23,260
That's a good thing.

1940
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:26,840
So...

1941
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:28,080
Save under...

1942
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:30,040
Balloons.

1943
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:32,980
And then we can include that into this file.

1944
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:33,820
Here.

1945
01:27:36,820 --> 01:27:38,560
Now we have them separated here.

1946
01:27:40,420 --> 01:27:41,180
Okay, okay.

1947
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:42,740
You want one in each hand?

1948
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:43,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1949
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:44,820
So like...

1950
01:27:44,820 --> 01:27:45,580
No, no, no.

1951
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:46,740
It should be in front.

1952
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:47,900
Yeah, right here.

1953
01:27:47,940 --> 01:27:49,140
Can we like...

1954
01:27:49,140 --> 01:27:50,140
Oh, we can make it like...

1955
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:51,680
Yeah, right here.

1956
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:54,040
And then the arms will hold on to it.

1957
01:27:55,380 --> 01:27:59,040
And then when you go up and down, the balloon starts jiggling.

1958
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:00,440
Okay.

1959
01:28:00,740 --> 01:28:01,560
Easy peasy.

1960
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:03,600
Okay.

1961
01:28:03,820 --> 01:28:04,620
Holding arms.

1962
01:28:04,820 --> 01:28:07,040
So we copy-paste now...

1963
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:10,200
Those arms and make a toggle.

1964
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:14,660
Main arms.

1965
01:28:15,060 --> 01:28:15,240
Yeah.

1966
01:28:16,900 --> 01:28:17,300
So...

1967
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:19,080
Toggle is...

1968
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:20,260
Main arms.

1969
01:28:20,660 --> 01:28:20,820
No.

1970
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:21,540
Balloon.

1971
01:28:21,940 --> 01:28:22,960
Balloon holding.

1972
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:29,520
So for the balloon holding, we are going to make them...

1973
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:31,340
Do it a little bit easy now.

1974
01:28:32,980 --> 01:28:35,940
Because I will make the transition later.

1975
01:28:36,260 --> 01:28:36,680
Uh-huh.

1976
01:28:36,940 --> 01:28:41,080
To make sure we go fastly to the ultimate...

1977
01:28:43,340 --> 01:28:45,040
Jiggle physics of the balloons.

1978
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:46,280
This is very important.

1979
01:28:46,620 --> 01:28:47,300
We need those.

1980
01:28:47,740 --> 01:28:48,980
Yes, yes, yes.

1981
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:49,460
Yes.

1982
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:50,160
I understand.

1983
01:28:51,260 --> 01:28:51,960
I understand.

1984
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:56,180
So...

1985
01:28:56,180 --> 01:28:59,100
Why is the chin still there?

1986
01:28:59,980 --> 01:29:00,800
Oh, oh, oh.

1987
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:01,240
I mean...

1988
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:02,340
I like...

1989
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:04,100
My chat was like, why is it still there?

1990
01:29:06,620 --> 01:29:09,260
Do we want the...

1991
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:11,500
The arm should be a little bit above, right?

1992
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:13,560
Like, it should be above the balloons.

1993
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:15,680
This means like...

1994
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:15,960
Here?

1995
01:29:18,860 --> 01:29:20,200
What do you think?

1996
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:27,120
It should be placed like this, maybe?

1997
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,720
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1998
01:29:34,450 --> 01:29:35,050
Yes.

1999
01:29:35,350 --> 01:29:36,830
Also, let me add the tail again.

2000
01:29:38,230 --> 01:29:40,490
The tail was gone for too long.

2001
01:29:40,850 --> 01:29:41,790
Oh my god.

2002
01:29:42,630 --> 01:29:43,050
Look at it.

2003
01:29:43,250 --> 01:29:43,510
Yes.

2004
01:29:43,730 --> 01:29:44,870
Now we have some balloons.

2005
01:29:45,370 --> 01:29:45,450
It's beautiful.

2006
01:29:47,190 --> 01:29:51,230
So, I'll have here this one and...

2007
01:29:51,230 --> 01:29:54,170
We add the balloon toggle here.

2008
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:56,490
Balloons.

2009
01:29:56,890 --> 01:29:57,250
Here.

2010
01:30:01,870 --> 01:30:04,950
On body Y, so they will move already with the body.

2011
01:30:05,110 --> 01:30:06,490
Like, this looks awkward.

2012
01:30:08,130 --> 01:30:09,970
It has everything on it.

2013
01:30:11,450 --> 01:30:12,870
So, I'll delete this.

2014
01:30:13,930 --> 01:30:15,130
And we make...

2015
01:30:15,730 --> 01:30:18,590
The balloon toggle here.

2016
01:30:19,310 --> 01:30:20,430
Balloon toggle.

2017
01:30:21,410 --> 01:30:23,070
Guys, this is the final stretch.

2018
01:30:23,890 --> 01:30:27,070
After this, the dragoon is basically like done.

2019
01:30:27,610 --> 01:30:28,130
Wait, right?

2020
01:30:28,390 --> 01:30:28,950
Yes.

2021
01:30:28,970 --> 01:30:30,390
Oh, this is the last thing.

2022
01:30:30,390 --> 01:30:33,250
This is the last thing for our dragoons.

2023
01:30:34,850 --> 01:30:35,970
We can...

2024
01:30:35,970 --> 01:30:39,590
I would add all those things you mentioned before.

2025
01:30:39,770 --> 01:30:41,770
I will add them still for the community.

2026
01:30:43,730 --> 01:30:45,650
And I will send it to you.

2027
01:30:45,790 --> 01:30:47,990
So, you can just post it or release it.

2028
01:30:48,050 --> 01:30:49,650
Or I just post it on my Twitter.

2029
01:30:49,990 --> 01:30:51,090
I am Thomas Edison.

2030
01:30:55,350 --> 01:30:58,830
Our group project together that we made.

2031
01:30:59,610 --> 01:31:01,610
Working together, guys.

2032
01:31:02,070 --> 01:31:04,270
We worked so hard together.

2033
01:31:06,590 --> 01:31:08,590
I'll be Thomas Edison.

2034
01:31:08,850 --> 01:31:09,710
I'll be my Oshie.

2035
01:31:10,070 --> 01:31:11,770
I can be just like my Oshie.

2036
01:31:11,830 --> 01:31:12,490
Oh my god.

2037
01:31:13,570 --> 01:31:16,210
So, this is the balloon toggle.

2038
01:31:16,810 --> 01:31:17,410
Here we are.

2039
01:31:19,450 --> 01:31:21,830
I just wrote balloon golding.

2040
01:31:22,330 --> 01:31:24,110
I mean balloon holding.

2041
01:31:25,590 --> 01:31:26,610
Not golding.

2042
01:31:27,460 --> 01:31:28,850
So, here this is...

2043
01:31:29,420 --> 01:31:30,610
This is on like...

2044
01:31:33,790 --> 01:31:34,970
It's alright, Arnold.

2045
01:31:35,210 --> 01:31:36,870
We make it on one so...

2046
01:31:36,870 --> 01:31:37,930
It's just like balloon time.

2047
01:31:39,010 --> 01:31:40,150
It's balloon time.

2048
01:31:40,630 --> 01:31:42,270
It's a fun time.

2049
01:31:43,170 --> 01:31:44,710
He's like holding his balloon.

2050
01:31:45,170 --> 01:31:45,620
He's like...

2051
01:31:48,690 --> 01:31:49,270
So...

2052
01:31:49,270 --> 01:31:49,710
Oh, wait.

2053
01:31:49,870 --> 01:31:52,290
Let me get this camera thing out of the way.

2054
01:31:53,230 --> 01:31:54,290
Here we are.

2055
01:31:54,290 --> 01:31:58,550
So, now we need to add this a little bit to the angles, you know.

2056
01:32:00,290 --> 01:32:04,110
I want that they take it with them.

2057
01:32:04,190 --> 01:32:04,530
Okay.

2058
01:32:06,550 --> 01:32:10,890
We just make it very simple because we're going to add those physics here.

2059
01:32:11,950 --> 01:32:13,230
Oh, this is buggy.

2060
01:32:13,870 --> 01:32:15,270
I'll do it later.

2061
01:32:15,690 --> 01:32:18,090
First of all, the wonderful balloons.

2062
01:32:18,870 --> 01:32:20,770
Now, of course, we go low.

2063
01:32:21,690 --> 01:32:22,730
This looks...

2064
01:32:23,990 --> 01:32:24,510
Yeah.

2065
01:32:26,330 --> 01:32:27,310
Oh, my gosh.

2066
01:32:27,450 --> 01:32:29,070
It brings the villain.

2067
01:32:29,690 --> 01:32:31,370
He puts the balloon down.

2068
01:32:32,730 --> 01:32:34,930
Like, now we are here, but don't worry.

2069
01:32:34,930 --> 01:32:36,310
He puts the balloon down.

2070
01:32:38,390 --> 01:32:41,170
So, this one here was going to get changed.

2071
01:32:41,290 --> 01:32:41,530
Okay.

2072
01:32:41,730 --> 01:32:43,730
So, now we are rigging the...

2073
01:32:45,510 --> 01:32:47,090
Why is this so above?

2074
01:32:47,370 --> 01:32:48,410
What happened there?

2075
01:32:48,990 --> 01:32:49,910
Why is this here?

2076
01:32:50,090 --> 01:32:50,850
Don't worry.

2077
01:32:51,070 --> 01:32:51,610
I got that.

2078
01:32:52,730 --> 01:32:53,070
Here.

2079
01:32:56,850 --> 01:32:57,530
No.

2080
01:32:57,750 --> 01:32:58,410
What do you think?

2081
01:32:58,550 --> 01:33:00,010
Maybe, like, here?

2082
01:33:00,210 --> 01:33:00,670
Folding?

2083
01:33:00,810 --> 01:33:00,930
Here.

2084
01:33:03,810 --> 01:33:05,370
We have it, like, here.

2085
01:33:06,350 --> 01:33:06,850
Okay.

2086
01:33:08,410 --> 01:33:10,310
Okay, now we...

2087
01:33:10,310 --> 01:33:10,890
Oops.

2088
01:33:11,810 --> 01:33:12,490
Okay.

2089
01:33:15,450 --> 01:33:15,790
Okay.

2090
01:33:16,310 --> 01:33:17,950
Balloon R.

2091
01:33:18,810 --> 01:33:24,730
We make them separate into L and R for a little bit more dynamic.

2092
01:33:25,050 --> 01:33:25,850
For up and down.

2093
01:33:26,090 --> 01:33:29,050
Like, you know, when they slam, like...

2094
01:33:29,050 --> 01:33:29,250
Yeah.

2095
01:33:29,550 --> 01:33:31,570
Oh, my God.

2096
01:33:31,810 --> 01:33:33,110
Oh, my God.

2097
01:33:33,370 --> 01:33:34,990
Oh, my God.

2098
01:33:35,290 --> 01:33:37,030
Someone put a brawn.

2099
01:33:39,610 --> 01:33:42,090
Oh, like, brawnless.

2100
01:33:42,250 --> 01:33:43,830
Wow, Dragoon.

2101
01:33:44,650 --> 01:33:46,670
Let them swing free, I guess.

2102
01:33:48,710 --> 01:33:50,030
Let them free.

2103
01:33:50,650 --> 01:33:52,030
They need some fresh air.

2104
01:33:52,270 --> 01:33:53,110
Free the balloons.

2105
01:33:54,450 --> 01:33:55,270
Balloon one.

2106
01:33:56,030 --> 01:33:56,630
Y1.

2107
01:33:57,090 --> 01:34:01,870
For Y1, we make them, like, you know...

2108
01:34:01,870 --> 01:34:03,270
It's filled with water.

2109
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:06,090
That means, like, we need to stretch it a little bit.

2110
01:34:06,330 --> 01:34:06,510
Oh, that's true.

2111
01:34:06,510 --> 01:34:07,730
And make them here together.

2112
01:34:09,850 --> 01:34:11,330
And make them up.

2113
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:11,670
Okay.

2114
01:34:12,590 --> 01:34:13,790
I agree.

2115
01:34:14,530 --> 01:34:15,530
I agree.

2116
01:34:16,750 --> 01:34:18,870
We are just making balloons.

2117
01:34:19,070 --> 01:34:19,990
That's very important.

2118
01:34:20,010 --> 01:34:21,430
Yeah, guys, they're just balloons.

2119
01:34:23,950 --> 01:34:27,790
Oh, my God.

2120
01:34:30,710 --> 01:34:31,870
That's what you do.

2121
01:34:32,010 --> 01:34:34,030
That's what you get for freeing the balloons.

2122
01:34:36,150 --> 01:34:37,170
That's true.

2123
01:34:38,210 --> 01:34:42,650
And actually, like, logical, we have here this tiny thing.

2124
01:34:42,650 --> 01:34:45,770
It would stretch to this part, so...

2125
01:34:49,150 --> 01:34:52,990
Goes this up, and then this a little bit down.

2126
01:34:55,790 --> 01:34:57,790
I just like this.

2127
01:34:57,930 --> 01:35:00,570
And then, of course, we have the arm physics for it.

2128
01:35:00,950 --> 01:35:02,810
Arm with balloons.

2129
01:35:03,670 --> 01:35:05,690
Because they move with the balloons.

2130
01:35:05,830 --> 01:35:06,030
Yeah.

2131
01:35:06,770 --> 01:35:10,050
Like this, right?

2132
01:35:10,050 --> 01:35:12,790
So, the arm goes a little bit down.

2133
01:35:13,550 --> 01:35:15,030
Then a little bit up.

2134
01:35:15,730 --> 01:35:16,930
And, of course, the balloon, too.

2135
01:35:17,570 --> 01:35:22,570
Like having...

2136
01:35:23,590 --> 01:35:24,570
A little bit less.

2137
01:35:25,830 --> 01:35:26,810
Oh, my God.

2138
01:35:27,590 --> 01:35:28,030
Nice.

2139
01:35:28,190 --> 01:35:28,670
Let me see.

2140
01:35:28,850 --> 01:35:30,970
Let's see how we've done this.

2141
01:35:31,070 --> 01:35:31,350
Oh, wait.

2142
01:35:31,410 --> 01:35:33,130
We need another R physics.

2143
01:35:33,850 --> 01:35:34,290
R2.

2144
01:35:34,890 --> 01:35:35,330
Balloon.

2145
01:35:35,750 --> 01:35:38,390
Guys, we're learning how to do jiggle physics, guys.

2146
01:35:39,550 --> 01:35:41,050
But on water balloons.

2147
01:35:42,570 --> 01:35:44,610
Of course, water balloons.

2148
01:35:45,330 --> 01:35:46,370
That's the most safe...

2149
01:35:46,370 --> 01:35:47,010
Yeah.

2150
01:35:47,990 --> 01:35:49,670
That's just water balloons, guys.

2151
01:35:51,010 --> 01:35:53,910
I've never been a kid before holding your water balloons.

2152
01:35:56,910 --> 01:35:57,590
So...

2153
01:35:57,590 --> 01:35:59,170
Balloon Y.

2154
01:35:59,510 --> 01:36:01,210
We make the balloon Y now.

2155
01:36:02,510 --> 01:36:03,510
Take this.

2156
01:36:05,190 --> 01:36:06,710
Add one of...

2157
01:36:06,710 --> 01:36:07,990
Two physics points.

2158
01:36:08,150 --> 01:36:09,950
And let's see how this will look.

2159
01:36:10,490 --> 01:36:11,610
Oh, my God.

2160
01:36:11,610 --> 01:36:12,930
Oh, my God.

2161
01:36:13,070 --> 01:36:14,410
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2162
01:36:14,450 --> 01:36:15,670
Maybe this one one.

2163
01:36:19,150 --> 01:36:20,690
This looks so fun.

2164
01:36:21,450 --> 01:36:22,270
Oh, my God.

2165
01:36:22,490 --> 01:36:23,970
Oh, my God.

2166
01:36:24,250 --> 01:36:25,230
Okay, okay.

2167
01:36:25,350 --> 01:36:28,010
Can we add that to the orange one?

2168
01:36:30,170 --> 01:36:31,290
Wait, wait, wait.

2169
01:36:31,430 --> 01:36:32,050
I have another...

2170
01:36:32,470 --> 01:36:33,510
I have another R physics.

2171
01:36:33,770 --> 01:36:34,350
Wait, wait, wait.

2172
01:36:35,590 --> 01:36:36,290
Oh, my God.

2173
01:36:36,290 --> 01:36:37,030
We add this.

2174
01:36:38,490 --> 01:36:42,350
We need to get them slam together if we add this one.

2175
01:36:42,530 --> 01:36:42,710
What?

2176
01:36:43,550 --> 01:36:46,050
You gotta get them to slam together.

2177
01:36:46,170 --> 01:36:47,510
Oh, my God.

2178
01:36:51,690 --> 01:36:53,370
This is important, okay?

2179
01:36:53,430 --> 01:36:54,310
That's so important.

2180
01:36:54,390 --> 01:36:57,250
No, guys, she knows exactly how physics work, guys.

2181
01:36:58,110 --> 01:36:58,670
She...

2182
01:36:59,610 --> 01:37:01,370
She knows how it works.

2183
01:37:01,850 --> 01:37:04,190
She knows how the physics works, guys.

2184
01:37:04,310 --> 01:37:05,430
It's very important.

2185
01:37:07,850 --> 01:37:09,250
So, so, so.

2186
01:37:09,370 --> 01:37:12,770
Now we add the physics here.

2187
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:13,210
Yeah.

2188
01:37:14,370 --> 01:37:16,490
We make one for the Y now.

2189
01:37:16,870 --> 01:37:20,290
Of course, I forgot to take my param again.

2190
01:37:21,010 --> 01:37:22,610
I just say it because I'm nervous.

2191
01:37:24,150 --> 01:37:27,770
Why are you bringing water balloons?

2192
01:37:36,130 --> 01:37:37,450
We are making this together.

2193
01:37:39,250 --> 01:37:40,370
And now...

2194
01:37:40,370 --> 01:37:41,810
This is the important part.

2195
01:37:43,190 --> 01:37:45,010
I really love the stretchy physics.

2196
01:37:48,970 --> 01:37:50,150
You sure do.

2197
01:37:50,290 --> 01:37:53,590
I can tell you are very experienced with these stretches.

2198
01:37:55,990 --> 01:37:57,810
I call them the...

2199
01:37:57,810 --> 01:37:59,510
Actually, I don't have a name for them.

2200
01:38:00,870 --> 01:38:03,270
I thought I would be faster with a name, but nope.

2201
01:38:03,430 --> 01:38:05,570
I call them the physics of doom.

2202
01:38:07,230 --> 01:38:08,130
It's just...

2203
01:38:09,030 --> 01:38:10,530
It's just chicken physics.

2204
01:38:10,650 --> 01:38:11,790
It's like pudding physics.

2205
01:38:11,790 --> 01:38:12,210
It's pudding.

2206
01:38:12,830 --> 01:38:13,890
Boing, boing, guys.

2207
01:38:16,590 --> 01:38:18,430
Look, he's having fun.

2208
01:38:18,970 --> 01:38:20,670
Look at him go.

2209
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:26,080
I love it.

2210
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:28,000
It's beautiful.

2211
01:38:28,580 --> 01:38:29,660
Look at it go.

2212
01:38:32,860 --> 01:38:34,860
Let me see how this looks.

2213
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:38,840
It's a lot of trial and error until you are happy with those physics.

2214
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:43,120
Now you can see here, the physics goes a little bit more down to the orange.

2215
01:38:43,300 --> 01:38:44,620
And I like this a little bit more.

2216
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:46,480
It's good that it's not the same, too.

2217
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:48,660
Because it's like, you know...

2218
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:51,600
The left side is bigger, you know.

2219
01:38:56,380 --> 01:38:57,560
Look at this.

2220
01:38:57,700 --> 01:38:57,880
Yay.

2221
01:38:58,520 --> 01:39:00,940
Imagine you would have them on a different position.

2222
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:03,640
Oh my god.

2223
01:39:03,780 --> 01:39:05,260
What would it look like if there's...

2224
01:39:05,260 --> 01:39:05,520
Okay.

2225
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:09,200
What would it look like if she looks left side with it, too?

2226
01:39:10,420 --> 01:39:12,480
Left side and then...

2227
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:14,620
Or right side and then with the butt.

2228
01:39:17,180 --> 01:39:20,200
Let me just see why the tail is...

2229
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:21,700
So funky here.

2230
01:39:23,660 --> 01:39:25,220
Wait, is this tail long?

2231
01:39:25,420 --> 01:39:26,960
You want the shorter tail?

2232
01:39:28,460 --> 01:39:31,740
Because the shorter tail goes so far up and I have no idea why.

2233
01:39:32,740 --> 01:39:34,160
He's very happy.

2234
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:38,560
He's just happy to sleep.

2235
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:40,140
He's tired.

2236
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:42,400
Yes, that's right, Dragoon.

2237
01:39:42,940 --> 01:39:44,300
Dance for me.

2238
01:39:45,340 --> 01:39:45,960
Okay, okay.

2239
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:48,080
So now we have this one.

2240
01:39:50,580 --> 01:39:51,360
It's so...

2241
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:52,140
It's beautiful.

2242
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:53,320
Oh my god, wait.

2243
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:53,980
Is it done?

2244
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:56,160
Albus, Albus.

2245
01:39:56,220 --> 01:39:56,940
We got it, Albus.

2246
01:39:57,020 --> 01:39:57,900
Just a second.

2247
01:39:59,680 --> 01:40:00,120
Right.

2248
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:01,560
We need to add the...

2249
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:05,940
Physic for the balloons on X and then we are done.

2250
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:07,320
Oh my god.

2251
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:07,540
And then...

2252
01:40:07,540 --> 01:40:11,060
I can't believe we did all of this within like two hours.

2253
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:12,340
That's crazy.

2254
01:40:13,380 --> 01:40:13,940
Yes.

2255
01:40:14,580 --> 01:40:16,600
Only the X now here.

2256
01:40:16,860 --> 01:40:18,840
We add this for this one, too.

2257
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:20,020
And then we are done.

2258
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:22,780
And then we see how it looks fully.

2259
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:32,000
Okay.

2260
01:40:32,260 --> 01:40:33,380
We did it, guys.

2261
01:40:37,690 --> 01:40:37,990
So...

2262
01:40:38,610 --> 01:40:41,210
And now, balloon X.

2263
01:40:41,770 --> 01:40:45,510
I just forgot the second L, but no problem here.

2264
01:40:47,550 --> 01:40:49,050
And now we need to...

2265
01:40:49,050 --> 01:40:51,710
We put this into the numbers and then...

2266
01:40:55,570 --> 01:40:57,170
Oh my god, guys.

2267
01:40:57,270 --> 01:40:58,450
Look at you go.

2268
01:40:58,970 --> 01:41:00,950
Look at you go.

2269
01:41:03,430 --> 01:41:04,030
Yes.

2270
01:41:04,350 --> 01:41:05,570
So now this is it.

2271
01:41:05,610 --> 01:41:07,050
This is what we've done on stream.

2272
01:41:07,910 --> 01:41:14,290
Of course, before sending out, I would just adjust some things to make it more fitting.

2273
01:41:14,530 --> 01:41:18,350
Adjust some stuff and add the auto toggles and adjust a little bit to...

2274
01:41:18,350 --> 01:41:20,210
Oh my god, guys.

2275
01:41:21,510 --> 01:41:23,910
And then you are free to do whatever you like with it.

2276
01:41:23,970 --> 01:41:26,050
Oh my god, everybody.

2277
01:41:26,630 --> 01:41:27,970
That was beautiful.

2278
01:41:28,210 --> 01:41:31,770
She did all of this within two hours.

2279
01:41:31,930 --> 01:41:33,970
That's actually crazy.

2280
01:41:34,740 --> 01:41:39,390
We had special requests, guys.

2281
01:41:39,690 --> 01:41:40,890
Look at that.

2282
01:41:42,050 --> 01:41:43,730
Oh my god.

2283
01:41:44,250 --> 01:41:46,970
Wow, that was actually really interesting.

2284
01:41:47,350 --> 01:41:48,610
Thank you for like...

2285
01:41:48,610 --> 01:41:52,170
I'm glad we did this as our collab.

2286
01:41:52,390 --> 01:41:55,010
That was very interesting to see and everything.

2287
01:41:55,070 --> 01:41:57,410
That was a very nice experience, not gonna lie.

2288
01:41:58,470 --> 01:41:59,070
You're welcome.

2289
01:41:59,190 --> 01:42:03,090
I was very happy and it was super fun to show some things off.

2290
01:42:05,010 --> 01:42:07,110
I'm not banned on Twitch, so...

2291
01:42:07,850 --> 01:42:09,090
See, she's okay.

2292
01:42:09,290 --> 01:42:10,810
It's not my fault, guys.

2293
01:42:11,390 --> 01:42:13,530
Minya is okay, guys.

2294
01:42:13,850 --> 01:42:16,170
But yes, please check her out on Twitch.

2295
01:42:16,210 --> 01:42:21,390
She does a lot of rigging stuff and she also plays a lot of video games as well on her Twitch.

2296
01:42:22,250 --> 01:42:23,910
But yeah, it was a great experience.

2297
01:42:24,770 --> 01:42:27,830
Let me link your Twitch real quick for those who want to check her out.

2298
01:42:27,850 --> 01:42:28,850
Thank you so much.

2299
01:42:29,050 --> 01:42:30,410
But yeah, thank you.

2300
01:42:30,590 --> 01:42:32,930
That was such a great experience in general.

2301
01:42:32,930 --> 01:42:34,550
I felt like I learned a lot.

2302
01:42:34,670 --> 01:42:36,230
I don't know how you did all this, but...

2303
01:42:36,230 --> 01:42:39,930
I feel like I learned a lot in general, even though I don't know what you did.

2304
01:42:43,670 --> 01:42:48,610
Also, I want to say thank you to the one that was recommending me, Alex.

2305
01:42:48,830 --> 01:42:52,050
Yeah, huge shoutout to Alex for setting this up for us.

2306
01:42:52,170 --> 01:42:53,610
But it was really nice to meet.

2307
01:42:53,630 --> 01:42:56,590
This is our first time actually talking in voice together.

2308
01:42:56,730 --> 01:43:01,390
Because we were just organizing this collab and I'm really busy too.

2309
01:43:02,690 --> 01:43:10,270
It was sort of really difficult to organize because I was sick, then I was busy, then I was sick again.

2310
01:43:10,730 --> 01:43:12,930
Then I got better and then I got sick again.

2311
01:43:15,270 --> 01:43:16,410
But we made it.

2312
01:43:16,830 --> 01:43:17,690
We made it.

2313
01:43:17,830 --> 01:43:18,850
We're finally here.

2314
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:20,750
But yes, thank you again.

2315
01:43:20,990 --> 01:43:22,410
It was really great talking to you.

2316
01:43:22,490 --> 01:43:24,170
It was really great meeting you too.

2317
01:43:24,590 --> 01:43:25,650
I had a great time.

2318
01:43:25,710 --> 01:43:25,830
Thank you.

2319
01:43:26,890 --> 01:43:29,030
But please, feel free to check her out.

2320
01:43:29,190 --> 01:43:30,510
Follow her on Twitch.

2321
01:43:30,510 --> 01:43:32,150
Show her some love.

2322
01:43:32,490 --> 01:43:34,010
But thank you again.

2323
01:43:34,510 --> 01:43:40,510
I had a great experience and we did some really fucked up shit, but...

2324
01:43:40,510 --> 01:43:42,010
I can't wait to...

2325
01:43:42,010 --> 01:43:46,750
I can't wait to release the Dragoon for people.

2326
01:43:48,050 --> 01:43:51,030
I hope we can see many people playing with it.

2327
01:43:52,330 --> 01:43:52,930
Imagine.

2328
01:43:54,050 --> 01:43:56,130
Do you have any final words you want to say?

2329
01:43:57,370 --> 01:44:00,010
I was super nervous at the start.

2330
01:44:01,250 --> 01:44:03,830
But I'm so happy it went so well.

2331
01:44:03,970 --> 01:44:05,930
Thank you, Doki, for this nice experience.

2332
01:44:06,630 --> 01:44:07,850
It was super funny.

2333
01:44:08,490 --> 01:44:09,450
Yeah, it was.

2334
01:44:09,490 --> 01:44:10,590
It was actually really...

2335
01:44:10,590 --> 01:44:11,410
It was so fun.

2336
01:44:12,110 --> 01:44:13,170
But thank you again.

2337
01:44:13,290 --> 01:44:15,830
Yes, if you want to actually learn more about rigging, I know like...

2338
01:44:15,830 --> 01:44:20,590
I'm pretty sure in your own solo streams, you do teach more about the rigging process.

2339
01:44:21,090 --> 01:44:23,250
Rather than us fucking around.

2340
01:44:23,690 --> 01:44:25,830
Adding Jingle Physics to everything.

2341
01:44:28,290 --> 01:44:29,730
Why did you laugh so hard?

2342
01:44:29,730 --> 01:44:32,030
I'm gonna go rest my voice now.

2343
01:44:32,390 --> 01:44:33,470
Thank you again.

2344
01:44:34,110 --> 01:44:36,910
I'm gonna talk to my Dragoons real quick.

2345
01:44:37,090 --> 01:44:37,890
And I guess you'll talk to...

2346
01:44:37,890 --> 01:44:38,690
What are your fans called?

2347
01:44:39,050 --> 01:44:40,530
Yes, I will do as well.

2348
01:44:40,610 --> 01:44:41,730
Thank you so much.

2349
01:44:41,850 --> 01:44:42,730
Yeah, thank you.

2350
01:44:43,730 --> 01:44:44,550
Rest well.

2351
01:44:44,710 --> 01:44:45,130
Thank you.

2352
01:44:45,210 --> 01:44:47,630
Yeah, my voice is so dead right now at this point.

2353
01:44:48,750 --> 01:44:49,930
I laughed too much.

2354
01:44:51,310 --> 01:44:52,910
Alright, thank you again.

2355
01:44:53,010 --> 01:44:54,190
I'll see you next time.

2356
01:44:55,150 --> 01:44:55,750
Bye-bye.

2357
01:44:55,930 --> 01:44:56,850
Bye-bye.

2358
01:44:56,990 --> 01:44:57,510
Bye-bye.

2359
01:44:57,630 --> 01:44:59,050
I'm gonna talk to my Dragoons now.

2360
01:44:59,050 --> 01:44:59,410
Bye-bye.

2361
01:45:02,310 --> 01:45:05,330
Oh my god, okay, my voice is so dead now.

2362
01:45:05,490 --> 01:45:06,930
I laughed way too much.

2363
01:45:09,050 --> 01:45:10,530
It was a great experience.

2364
01:45:11,050 --> 01:45:19,330
I am going to rest my voice, because I do have a meet and greet for TakuFest and a panel later today.

2365
01:45:19,590 --> 01:45:22,470
So, I have 3, 4, 5...I have 4 hours to rest my voice.

2366
01:45:22,810 --> 01:45:24,070
So, thank you again, everybody!

2367
01:45:24,070 --> 01:45:30,250
A huge shout-out again to Alex for bidding on a charity auction collab and letting me meet Mimyoi.

2368
01:45:30,530 --> 01:45:35,370
And I had a great time talking to her throughout the stream and just doing all these crazy shit.

2369
01:45:35,710 --> 01:45:37,370
I'm gonna rest my voice now, as always.

2370
01:45:38,170 --> 01:45:41,270
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

2371
01:45:41,790 --> 01:45:44,210
Posture check, get a move-around to get that blood flowing.

2372
01:45:44,530 --> 01:45:48,250
And if you stay up for me, head to bed, because you deserve it.

2373
01:45:48,630 --> 01:45:51,290
Tonight, 5PM stream is cancelled, by the way.

2374
01:45:51,290 --> 01:45:54,910
The stream at 5PM is cancelled, because you didn't listen to me.

2375
01:45:55,190 --> 01:45:56,690
Anyway, bye, everyone!

2376
01:45:57,090 --> 01:45:57,530
Bye!

2377
01:45:59,610 --> 01:46:00,510
Where's my ending screen?

2378
01:46:00,590 --> 01:46:00,930
Oh, there it is.

2379
01:46:00,990 --> 01:46:01,310
Bye!
