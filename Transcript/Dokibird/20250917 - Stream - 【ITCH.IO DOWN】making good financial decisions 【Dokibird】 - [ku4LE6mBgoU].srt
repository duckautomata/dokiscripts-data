1
00:01:51,770 --> 00:02:00,750
Hello everybody, I'm sorry, I'm sorry for the delay, but it didn't matter because itch.io is down.

2
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:06,450
Apparently I was on the Reddit, it's been down for like two hours already.

3
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:13,530
So even if I started on time, we still would have pivoted because itchio, I don't know, maybe someone's DDoS.

4
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,130
Someone was mad about not winning a different game jam or something.

5
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:20,510
So they decided DDoS, DDoS itchio.

6
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:32,670
I mean if you pissed off a I feel like when you if you piss off a developer a game dev Um, I think like I think that's that seems like something that could happen like

7
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,710
I don't know they got the tool.

8
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:57,870
Yeah, they got the tools right in front of them Or maybe the credit card or maybe the credit card thing it could be that it could be either Um, it could be either a credit card thing or Or, um, or, or, like, someone just got mad at Ichio about something and just decide.

9
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,710
Or, I mean, it could be that, too.

10
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,210
They got mad about Ichio removing some games.

11
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:09,030
And then they decided DDoS Ichio because of, because of a credit card, the credit card issue.

12
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:14,730
Um, um, so yeah, uh, it's, uh, it's down right now.

13
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,050
Um, or, and it's, like, really slow.

14
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,150
So I can load up.

15
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,090
I did load up.

16
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:50,310
i did load up like oh my rewinds on yeah sorry my my uh my manager made my waiting room guys know this whenever my my staff makes my winning room um uh i've uh they forget to turn off dvr so um i'm so used to just going live because when i make the waiting room i already i turn off the dv also rewinds off now when i make the waiting room i um always i automatically turn off dvr because It's just like,

17
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,390
um, reflex at that point.

18
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,630
It's just like, uh, blah, blah, what's the word?

19
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:59,430
It's just my, like, oh, fuck, what's the word?

20
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,410
It's just routine at that point.

21
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:09,230
So, uh, so, yeah, it's a habit.

22
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,590
Yeah, it's sick muscle memory.

23
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:11,510
Yeah, that's the word.

24
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:15,350
It's muscle memory, second nature for me now to turn off DVR.

25
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,230
But obviously, uh, my sad doesn't make my weight even very often.

26
00:04:19,250 --> 00:05:38,670
it's only when I'm like super tired or um I'm like already in bed and I don't like I would be like I'm gonna I'm gonna like uh rest in bed for a little bit I'm gonna lie down for a little bit and uh I'll get up later because I'm like really I'm like a bit eepy and then I get I get on my bed and I'm like wait I'm very eepy I don't really want to get up I'm like extra eepy time um the bed has taken another victim um andy think it was super chat thank you thank you man recommend making this a shame dad stream think it was super chat thing you think oh i was gonna shame him regardless of whether or not itchio was down um anyway someone was asking why do i turn rewind off um there's a couple of reasons so uh one reason why i turn um uh i turn rewind off um is because uh it was was a uh a rule back then where we had to turn it off um because like um if you know if there was any like anything happening on the stream um we can private the stream instantly so people usually you know it can't if

27
00:05:38,670 --> 00:06:45,070
something happens people can't rewind back to whatever happens on the stream so it was like a way to mitigate like any um anything that any oh my gosh sorry my brain's tired any little oopsies that might happen on stream like whether it's like something where you know um my gosh sorry my brain is like super slow because it's in the morning yeah it's like risk reduction yeah it's like a safe guide really like you know like if accidentally it doxed or uh something happens on stream where you know um you're playing a game and some people decide to be some gamers or anything and it's harder so you know we have to like private the stream snip it out and then unprivated or never never take like or keep it private forever so it just helps it's more like a safeguard thing where um where we we don't have the rewind on so so people can't just rewind it back to it and clip it.

28
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:52,530
So it prevents clipping for anything like controversial that might happen on stream, like any risk that happens on stream.

29
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,650
So people can't just rewind and clip it.

30
00:06:55,290 --> 00:07:05,370
Another reason why I like to put Rewind on, this is my, it's a per, for me now, since I'm not corporal, for me, it's also personal reasons.

31
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:08,790
Because,

32
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:18,570
I prefer having rewind off so that people are watching what's going on now.

33
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:28,890
And when people are like chatting, chatting, they're all seeing what's happening now on stream versus like what's going on like, you know, an hour ago, they're watching a rewind.

34
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:32,710
And more so it gives off the live feeling of the stream.

35
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:36,130
And that's for me, that's my personally, it's like an in the moment thing.

36
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,770
So that's my own personal.

37
00:07:38,790 --> 00:08:09,830
reasons but like you know there is that first reason which is like um which is like more so like a must a habit that i kept from from the before times um aphelion thank you for the magenta soup but thank you thank you donkey jam or not i'm glad to start my birthday with a donkey shame hope you and the dragons are having a good one thank you thank you for the magenta soup but thank you thank you i really appreciate it happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday to aphelion.

38
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,150
Happy birthday to you.

39
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:12,610
Yeah.

40
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,230
Happy birthday.

41
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:15,350
Yeah.

42
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,310
But yeah.

43
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,890
Um, what is that?

44
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,490
Where was that?

45
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:23,070
Where was I?

46
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:23,690
Where was my train?

47
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:23,970
Oh yeah.

48
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:27,650
For those who are running wide, my brain is really slow today.

49
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:35,410
And uh, I'm like lagging a little where I'm like, I can't, I can't figure out words right now.

50
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:36,330
I'm stumbling.

51
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:56,850
It's because that has been a piece of lately the last couple of days um um basically I think like the for the last week and a half he has gone to this new routine and I might need help I might need some ideas on how to stop him

52
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:12,270
so basically um what he does he he just started this new routine and I don't know what to do to stop him is that he wakes me up at 6.30 a.m.

53
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:32,590
for his food for lunch breakfast and then I go back to sleep and then usually after that he's fine like he'll wake up whenever I wake up but now for the last week and a half he has been waking me up at 6.30 a.m.

54
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,990
and then also at

55
00:09:39,210 --> 00:10:09,870
and he would just i let him on my bed and so he would just like jump down from the bed and then just start like not jump down start use the stairs you use the stairs stand in front of my door and just be like and just like just keep barking at me and then um obviously um i'd be like no and then he would get back on my bed um lick me like lick my face and whatever because you're like i know you're still i know you're awake come on get up get up get up get up get up i wake And I'd be like,

56
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:10,190
no.

57
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:13,670
And then I just like, I would just like hold up my blanket.

58
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:17,970
And then he'll just crawl under my blanket and be like, okay, I just, I can rest a little longer.

59
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:23,050
And then I think like 15 minutes, 15 to 20 minutes will pass.

60
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,470
And then he'll be like, hey, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up.

61
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:31,590
And he'll like, he'll like walk down the stairs, sit in like, stand in front of my door again.

62
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:37,150
Be like, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up.

63
00:10:38,790 --> 00:11:32,750
my god and he he has been doing that for the last week and a half and i i i even like when i fed him okay um i have like i i i have like tried to like i brought out the bark collar uh i don't turn it on for those who are wondering i don't turn on my bark collar it's just like more so like ptsd for him to kick in but he's like i think he has outgrown the ptsd because um i fed him and i put the collar on him just to be like just to be like okay maybe he won't wake me up a second time and he'll just sleep and he called my bluff because exactly 11 a.m he'd be like hey wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up hey hey wake up wake up wake up wake up wake i'm just

64
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:52,080
So, so, so I'm like, so I've been having like really bad sleep lately just because he, he won't stop.

65
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,940
He, he, he doesn't stop.

66
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,420
There's no, there's no snooze button on dog.

67
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,000
I don't know what to do.

68
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:06,980
It's like he wants me to start sleeping earlier.

69
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,680
Like, who kind of freak is he?

70
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:18,180
I can't believe this fucking dog is trying to make me healthier or something.

71
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,360
Oh my god.

72
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,160

Happy birthday!

93
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:03,670
Um, yeah, no, it feels like he's training me right now, and I hate it.

94
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:07,150
I hate it so much.

95
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,670
Yeah.

96
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,690
Um, I'm just like, that's why the...

97
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:43,730
like my sleep I just been like having really bad sleep lately just because um just because of him like waking me up in like back to back and now I'll try to go back to sleep too and he'll still wake me up so like if I if he wakes up at 10 30 I'll like you know I'll be like no and that's like my snooze button for him and um and then he'll uh and then he'll like wake me up like like on like he'll keep waking me up every like 10 to 15 minutes or like 10 15 minutes And so it's like,

98
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:45,270
it's been such a, it's been a struggle.

99
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,570
Lately, the last week and a half, I don't know what to do.

100
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:53,890
It's either, it's like, I don't know.

101
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,310
I don't know what to do.

102
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,350
I mean, I could just sleep earlier, but I don't know.

103
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,290
I don't know what to do.

104
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:03,970
I mean, I could, I know, like, I could just sleep, but I don't know, guys.

105
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,950
It feels like I'm, I have no options, guys.

106
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:09,430
I feel like there's nothing I could do, guys.

107
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:12,510
Just absolutely nothing.

108
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:43,410
Georgia's thank you for the super chat thank you thank you Namo Namo Amitabu Hey Doki hope things get better for you and dad Also today's my birthday can you sing a song for me in Cantonese if you feel comfortable Don't just hi thank you for the super chat Georgia's thank you thank you I don't remember I was singing Cantonese,

109
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,590
um, are not singing in Mandarin for some fucking reason.

110
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:57,930
I think I just never had, I had the birthday song sang to me in Cantonese before.

111
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,970
I've only had it sang to me in Mandarin.

112
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:08,790
Just because like, um, because, uh, majority of my extended family speaks, uh, Mandarin.

113
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:15,790
So whenever it was my birthday, when I used to live in Asia, it was my they'll all sing it in Mandarin instead of Cantonese.

114
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:26,530
So, my mom's side speaks Cantonese, but when I celebrate my birthday with my mom's side, they'll sing it in English.

115
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:30,470
And then when I celebrate it with my dad's side, they'll sing it in Mandarin.

116
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:36,190
So I've never actually heard the Cantonese version of Happy Birthday.

117
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,870
I've only heard Mandarin and English.

118
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:40,910
So I said,

119
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:56,330
Happy birthday.

120
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:01,450
I don't know if I'm actually saying it correctly because I just said one line over and over.

121
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:06,230
Na Na Na, thank you, thank you, thank you.

122
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:11,790

Like, literally, like, I woke up at, like, 12 p.m.

143
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:28,810
today, and then I messaged my manager, and I was, like, can you push my waiting room, like, 30 minutes?

144
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,610
I'm so tired.

145
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,350
And then my manager was like, yeah, I could do that.

146
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:39,610
I'm just like, and I just laid in bed, and I was like, I looked at dad, and I was like, how could you?

147
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:40,190
How?

148
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,890
raised you since you were a baby.

149
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:49,350
How could you do this to me?

150
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,770
I put a roof over our heads.

151
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:56,050
I give you wet food.

152
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,190
What more do you want from me?

153
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,830
But for some, for those who are like, oh, get him an auto feeder.

154
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,390
He has to eat wet food.

155
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:11,010
Well, he doesn't have to, but it's better for his kidneys.

156
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:18,950
So that's why he doesn't have an auto-feeder because I don't think I can auto-feed wet food.

157
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,590
I didn't ask the vet.

158
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:31,370
I was like, is it possible to like change his diet to dry food again?

159
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:35,350
And they're like, well, it's not ideal, but I guess you could.

160
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:36,330
But it's not ideal.

161
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:42,690
I was like, oh, can I get like recommendations on like what dry food I could use then?

162
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:48,610
And then they never, they always somehow forget to give me the recommendation.

163
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,730
Because I remember, I asked twice.

164
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,770
And then they're like, what's ideal?

165
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:57,890
But yeah, I can give you a recommendation.

166
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,830
And then they just never, it just never, they just never gave it to me.

167
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,410
I think it just never existed.

168
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,210
I guess there's no recommendation.

169
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:09,310
He's just going to be like a spoiled pieces of shit for the rest of his life.

170
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,050
Nana, thank you for the rate.

171
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,250
Thank you, thank you.

172
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,890
I really appreciate it.

173
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:20,950
Thank you so much.

174
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,130
I hope you had a good stream.

175
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:29,550
But yeah, for those who are wondering why we're just here chatting, I don't know what to do today.

176
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:30,990
I honestly don't know what to do.

177
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,570
Manny, thank you for the gift and chips.

178
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:33,250
Thank you, thank you.

179
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,230
So I'm just, I haven't really had a chatting stream.

180
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:38,770
I think this is why my brain is really slow too.

181
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,890
They're like, they sell auto-wet food.

182
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:42,970
Oh my God.

183
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,750
I feel like that's, okay, Robert, thank you for the super chat.

184
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:46,030
Thank you.

185
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:46,630
Thank you.

186
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,070
That sounds disgusting.

187
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:57,430
Like, wouldn't the food like rot or wait, auto-wet food feeding?

188
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:03,590
I feel like, I feel like the food would just like rot, right?

189
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:07,670
Like, and the cleanup too sounds fucking terrible.

190
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:08,830
I feel like.

191
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:16,570
They have, we'll have to refrigerate, what's the point of an auto food feeder?

192
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:19,550
If I have to refrigerate it, then it's not automatic.

193
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:22,490
I have to put it in the fridge and take it out of the fridge.

194
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:28,710
Oh, it itself is, okay, I was going to say, do I put the entire thing?

195
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:32,170
Okay, so it's like a mini fridge.

196
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,410
Oh, I see.

197
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,790
It's like, oh, I like how they're mostly, it's for cats.

198
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,650
It's mostly for cats.

199
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:39,970
More sense.

200
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,210
I was like, there's no way.

201
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:44,230
Like, do I like, do I have to put the thing in the fridge?

202
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:48,010
Like, okay, so I like how it's mostly for cats, too.

203
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:51,430
Oh, it's like a, oh my gosh, it's so disgusting.

204
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:52,870
Oh my gosh, I have to clean it, though.

205
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:54,290
Looks a little disgusting.

206
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:54,690
Not gonna.

207
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:59,230
Yeah, it looks, it looks incredibly cat-coded.

208
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:03,910
For long-lasting cooling semiconductor.

209
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,030
Three mode settings.

210
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,550
Oh my gosh, it would be pretty ideal, though.

211
00:21:10,430 --> 00:22:03,950
not gonna lie this would solve a lot of my problems um but like cleaning it i mean it was just i just had to clean clean it like when it's done i guess um i'm looking through it i mean it could help i don't have to worry about him waking me up at 6 30 in the morning anymore because i should sleep through uh krish thank you for the five give the ships thank you thank you rice thank you for give the chip thank you thank you i'm looking at i think oh yeah so i think also like i've been selling my words a lot so i haven't done a lot of like chatting pure chatting streams in a long long time and so i think my brain has just like uh deteriorated like the i'm i'm deteriorated a little bit because i haven't like actually chatted chat in a while since i've been so busy so i guess i just have to like warm up again at the regain my chatting skills yeah it has been a while it

212
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:34,310
no like the thing is he requires other things is i can't do dry food for him because uh he he has to eat wet food because he has a special kidney diet uh for or actual brain rot maybe i just watched too many youtube shorts guys the brain rot is settling in i think i watched i think I've been watching too many YouTube shorts.

213
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:38,150
But yeah, he has a special diet that he needs to follow for his kidneys.

214
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,450
Like, the food is actually called, like, special.

215
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,150
It's, like, a kidney diet.

216
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:45,190
So, and that's why I can't...

217
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:45,890
That's why I've been asking...

218
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:46,830
I asked the vet, like, twice.

219
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:47,990
Like, oh, do you have recommendations?

220
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,650
And he has never given to me.

221
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,430
Like, every time, every time.

222
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:56,930
And because I don't want to get him the wrong food.

223
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:00,630
Just in case, you know, I don't want to, like, you know, I don't want him to...

224
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:04,210
I don't want to, like, fuck up his kidneys.

225
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,370
He's middle-aged now.

226
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:07,750
Like, anything can happen.

227
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:09,690
I could.

228
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,630
Alright, the best taste.

229
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:12,910
Okay, how long...

230
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,670
How long do they last, though?

231
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:16,430
Wet food...

232
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,170
Uh...

233
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:17,490
Okay.

234
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:18,670
Cooked meat.

235
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,070
Okay, with our...

236
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,870
Can keep canned food fresh.

237
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:23,250
Oh, for one to...

238
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,090
Oh, okay.

00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:25,090
Okay.

241
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:27,730
So, I can literally stock it up for...

242
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:29,210
Oh, wait, that's great.

243
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:31,710

245
00:24:25,320 --> 00:25:33,760

246
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,200
do you think he's, do you think this is too tall?

247
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,480
I don't know.

248
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:40,060
I don't know if this is too tall for him.

249
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,440
Okay.

250
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:50,700
Guys, do you think, do you think this feeder is too tall?

251
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,640
Because I can't tell.

252
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,300
I,

253
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,560
because like, dad is a short king and I, I can't tell.

254
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:10,160
if this is considered to Tom for him maybe

255
00:26:17,670 --> 00:27:44,530
he can he can just oh that's true he can just extend it like I don't know okay wait weiner weiner dog compared to cat height okay okay height there we go oh yeah no I oh wait no wait wait okay uh wait sorry doxin cat height comparison oh yeah no I oh yeah no I think he might be I think he might be too too short I I got I'm looking at this picture right now and I'm like okay if this is a regular cat size and that is a regular leaner dog size then he may or may not be too short he might be a short king I think I think I don't know cat seems really tall like I think cat seems really really tall um rice thank you for the super chat thank you Some very determined cats can break these things so I don't know how well to defend against a hungry boy Okay,

256
00:27:44,570 --> 00:28:07,570
so dad I don't think he knows how to open things yet Because like I know cats they have like They like to use their paws a lot Dad has figured out how to rotate stairs Like he hasn't figured out how to rotate stairs But he has figured out how to push stairs So I think like I think it'll be fine

257
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:15,230
He knows how to push things, but he doesn't know how to rotate.

258
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,370
So I think we're okay.

259
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:22,510
All right.

260
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:23,890
That seems, okay.

261
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:26,530
That cat feeder seems way too tall.

262
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:27,770
So I'm going to have to look at another one.

263
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:28,570

264
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:29,870

That cat is fucking as hell holy fuck oh my god this cat is bougie as a fuck this guy has a sashim that's a fancy ass cat all right uh five meal compartments i like how it's like uh initial meal uh you should have dry food freeze food and wet food should be consumed wait wet food should be consumed within Excuse me,

291
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:11,190
it told me that I can keep wet food, it can keep it fresh within, oh, like when it's outside of the freeze.

292
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,570
Okay, we're going to try this out.

293
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:13,710
All right, what are the reviews?

294
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:23,730
There's, guys, okay, the only downside is that there's only 32 people that have left the review on this.

295
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:28,330
I'm a little worried.

296
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:31,230
I'm a little worried.

297
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:36,430
32 people have left a review on it.

298
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:48,490
So I don't know if I should yeah, but the other ones with reviews Okay, the only okay the only thing that sucks is that The other ones with reviews.

299
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:51,770
Oh god, that looks fucking disgusting with the waifu in it

300
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:58,850
There's a 32 very it's not laziness.

301
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:01,450
I just want to sleep in the morning.

302
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:23,930
I just want to sleep in guys it's not laziness i'm so tired of waking up at 6 30 in the morning and then having him waking me up again at okay if he's gonna wake me up at 11 a.m i i would write i i want him i want him to skip the 6 30.

303
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:32,310
if i could get the automatic feeder in going at least i can like at least I can have a continuous sleep till 11.

304
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:34,490
Instead of waking me at 6.30.

305
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:37,090
And then waking me up again.

306
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:47,250
Look, I left elementary, middle, and high school.

307
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:54,550
I thought after graduating high school, I wouldn't have to wake up at 6 in the morning anymore.

308
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:57,450
Guys, I already went through this.

309
00:33:58,930 --> 00:33:59,530
Time.

310
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:00,130
Okay.

311
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:03,630
I did my 630 time.

312
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:12,610
Graduating high school meant I wouldn't have to go through that again.

313
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:15,970
And I feel, yeah.

314
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,830
I did my part.

315
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:21,810
Make it sound.

316
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:28,770
You know, schools were originally meant to be built and or like built and set up to be like a prison.

317
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:42,110
right guys like that's like the original intent of schools they it was meant to like replicate a prison system I served my time

318
00:34:45,560 --> 00:35:53,260
show it over oh yeah yeah I mean a factory environment I mean factory prison same thing all right I'm trying to figure out what I don't want to buy the I the only ones that are like with higher views are the ice packs but it's like I have to not only will I have to clean the machine like every like every time it's done every time I've used up all the feeding stations but I also have to refrigerate the ice like I don't want to fucking deal with that just give me one thing that I am willing to pay the money I am willing to pay for it all right the only one that seems to like have its own refrigerating system and also uh um and also has high reviews is the one that my it's a really tall one so am I gonna force that to extend his neck just to eat food it's very tempting.

319
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,540
It's very tempting.

320
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,200
Pour just a little morsely.

321
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,160
I'll be like, pure.

322
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,380
It's like I'm making it a sauce situation for him.

323
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,380
Like, do you want to eat or do you want to starve?

324
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,180
He's got to work for it.

325
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,180
He's like, hello, dad.

326
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,220

328
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:46,310
my brain is super rusty right now when it comes to talking

329
00:36:49,530 --> 00:37:52,390
i don't know i think it's a mixture of both just because it's like for me it's early but for me it's early and like I feel like I'm super rusty right now all right absolute piece of junk it doesn't always open the feeder cat the apple ring the bell manually but the lid won't open manually you get the spinning wheel of death this is all while I'm standing beside it how on earth can you trust it to feed your bed when you are awake what a joke of a device zero stars okay maybe I shouldn't buy okay piece of junk do not buy um what is the other one was the okay not all of them is bad guys let's see uh do not buy it does not get cold enough this is not cold enough after a few days the food is sitting at 60 degrees it should be around four degrees this doesn't work for canned food and definitely would not work for raw the dishes are made of plastic which is bad Hero Grove.

330
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:56,010
Do not buy this frost made a plow.

331
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:56,390
Okay.

332
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:57,190
Okay.

333
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:58,790
Guys, I don't think I can buy this.

334
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:01,830
I don't think this is a good thing to buy.

335
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:06,510

I just got back from hope you're having good streams.

343
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:17,610
Shout out to people who work in the fast food industry as I did.

344
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:18,310
So tired.

345
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:18,570
Thank you.

346
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:19,390
Thank you.

347
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:19,790
Thank you.

348
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:20,550
Oh my gosh.

349
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:56,630
uh power to you man um i hear it's i know it's like super stressful to work in the fast food industry too uh especially because like uh especially for and retail workers because like customers people are just so mean i mean so fucking mean this is why and then like then you have to be afraid because like ai is taking over a lot of jobs right now too uh guys i don't think the automatic feeder seems to be a good idea anymore what do i okay i'm gonna read the 32 star i'm gonna read the one that has 32 reviews

350
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:04,080
all right i'm gonna read the reviews for this i mean

351
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:30,980
okay there's one okay uh easy to use but return there's only two of these types of devices on the market and i originally opted for this one because it was cheaper i like that it had five feeding slots and i also like that the window remained open until the next time slot My cat is a grazer and I returned this one because it just wasn't cooling the food enough when I filled it with chilled food It was resting at 58 degrees Fahrenheit.

352
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,420
What is that in like real real temperatures?

353
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:37,620
What's that did not make believe make believe temperatures guys?

354
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:50,340
Okay 14 degrees and even after freezing the food before filling the slot it was at 52 degrees within 52 Fahrenheit.

355
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,880
What the fuck is 52 Fahrenheit?

356
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:53,820
52 Fahrenheit.

357
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,900
Your stupid make-believe temperatures.

358
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,120
Make-believe numbers.

359
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:58,880
11 degrees.

360
00:39:59,100 --> 00:39:59,320
Okay.

361
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,900
So you're definitely warmer than a fridge.

362
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,020
It's not even in the heat of summer.

363
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,860
I don't know, however, that is very easy to set up.

364
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,100
Okay, then, like, what the fuck do I do?

365
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,580
Okay, what if I don't buy it on...

366
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,660
Okay, best automatic...

367
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,340
2,000 people are watching me try and figure out...

368
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:21,280
Like, try to figure out how to buy an automatic feeder.

369
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:28,540
Guys, this is a very important stream right now.

370
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,340
Automatic food.

371
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,200
Wet food.

372
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:34,700
Dispenser.

373
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:36,640
Society.

374
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,140

So, seamless.

379
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,420

Which is your HST?

381
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,000
That's a...

382
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,820
Taxes?

383
00:40:54,980 --> 00:42:11,340

389
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,560
Oh my god.

390
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:38,600
I might as well just use it to freeze my food.

391
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,940
Like, what the fuck?

392
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:45,220
This is a legitimately refrigerator.

393
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,920
So the one on Amazon.

394
00:42:47,500 --> 00:43:16,200

Refrigerated smart feeder.

All right, let me look this up.

398
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:28,940
Reviews.

399
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:30,660
I need a note.

400
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,400
So cool versus pet liberal.

401
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,680
All right, let's see.

402
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,300
There's a product review here.

403
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:41,600
All right, we're going to listen to this product review together, guys.

404
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:45,760
Welcome to the...

405
00:43:45,780 --> 00:44:53,600
ultimate comparison between the two top wet food feeders that exist right now okay that is the happy llama tech and the pet libra wet food feeder my kitty they promise under 40 degrees fahrenheit underneath here what's that guys convert this mad this make-believe number for me refrigerated temp so you really can keep this running for multiple days at a time on top of that it holds six servings well keep in mind that the first serving is going to be fed to your pet immediately so you really only have four degrees that's really good and you can serve in this plastic container underneath I'm just gonna go straight to pros and cons you're traveling whatever is going on you can ensure that your cat is getting exactly what they need when they need it fantastic for feeding your cat you can manage them even when you're not at home and they are fantastic for feeding your cat through the day let's say you're working you're traveling whatever is going on you can ensure that your cat is getting

406
00:44:53,600 --> 00:46:04,320
exactly what they need when they need it oh thank god that's like basically what i need right now has been such a wonderful sweetheart and i want to give him everything i can to make sure you have a cat now it's because he eats wet food okay you know like one of the medications for his kidneys okay i have to go to a different vet um i have to go to a different vet for um his medication because uh my vet was closed and it's called cementra and they're like they're like oh for your cat and i was like no it's a it's a dog my my my pet's a dog and he requires cementra so it's like this thing for his kidney and then they're like oh like it's like a and they're like oh we usually prescribe it for cats and they're like are you sure it's okay and i was like what what do you what do you mean i've been doing like that's what the hospital prescribed to me and then i didn't realize this because like yeah look at the box and where the box said it was like uh poor cats cementra and it was the same

407
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:38,660
but i didn't i didn't read the front of the box because i read the bottom the bottle doesn't say it was for cats but um yeah because apparently cats are more prone to kidney problems than dogs so like so they make this medication so usually it's given to cats just because like the medication like most most of the customers are for cats so that that did not win the genetic lottery unfortunately uh i'm so thrilled that i can give him fresh wet food right when he needs it,

408
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,140
not when I have the time to give it to him.

409
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:51,340
Now that I've gone over the differences between the two and broke down their features, I really want to go through the pros and cons real quick, and then I want to get into what I wish these did provide.

410
00:46:51,780 --> 00:47:04,560
Pros for the Happy Lama Tech are that it actually does have six servings, even though the first serving is fed automatically, and that it truly is at refrigerated temperatures.

411
00:47:04,740 --> 00:48:16,420
I trust that the food coming out to i mean that's good i don't want my food to start rotting food for my cat and expiring i don't want to grow mold and stuff as for a con i do wish it had the door like pet libra does so i could cover the food after a set period of time as this bowl is not cooled on either one as it's meant to come up to room temperature and so it means that any food that's in here too long you're listening to a review of what if I should buy a $600 dog feeding wet like wet food refrigerator like that's I was like am I really gonna spend $600 for my dog so I could sleep a little bit more that's what you're listening to right now but I've been working through that by making sure that the meals in this are small enough that he will eat them in time and if you are concerned about that at all since this does have six servings you can have it just rotate to an empty bowl to make sure they stop eating so you just do food empty bowl food he deserves it make it work like that

412
00:48:16,420 --> 00:49:16,900
so you can make this work now for the pet libro i think the no there's no way dad wouldn't like it if he sees food he doesn't fucking care what it comes out of like he is so food motivated he doesn't fucking care like you can drop food and water and he'll fucking swim over there just to gobble it up oh is that by way he doesn't even he doesn't even like water too by the way but he will do it that you can completely control when the door opens and closes as it's opening right now oh he has he has followed a stranger for food that's how fucked up he is that like that is exactly how fucked up situation is he will follow a stranger if she has food feed him but i had played with that so it's on the wrong meal and the other thing literally a lady i told the story before a lady walked up to us and she also had like a dog with her and then she gave dad a treat and then she walked away and dad followed her.

413
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:21,940
What about that one is that it has that larger whisker-framed.

414
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:27,720
If she had a van, he will follow her into a van and then drive away and then I'll be like, goodbye.

415
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:28,920
Open first.

416
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,900
He is happy with either of these.

417
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:37,660
As for the con, I do not like how much warmer that food is.

418
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:38,240
It is okay.

419
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:38,900
So it's warmer.

420
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:39,300
Okay.

421
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:43,040

And not only that, not only that, she like, joked about it.

426
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:54,540
The lady joked about it.

427
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,460
It's like, Kiki, what if I just take his leash?

428
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:59,040
Will he even, like, come back to you?

429
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,920
And then she, like, walked away with Dad with leash, and he didn't look back at me.

430
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,500
He didn't even hesitate or cared.

431
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:10,360
He would have been like, yes, that's my new owner now.

432
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,140
And then, like, the end.

00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:04,140

443
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,680

I forgot to.

449
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:30,540
read something very important guys guys I think our dream dreams of sleeping later has already been crushed because there was one important detail that I

450
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:49,950
missed it was some a very very important detail that I did not read in the terms and conditions all right Canada.

451
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:52,150
Maybe they have it in Canada.

452
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:54,730
Alright, let's see it.

453
00:52:56,170 --> 00:53:00,910
Alright, automatic wet food feeder available in Canada.

454
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:06,090
Alright.

455
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:13,010
I've been using the catmate 1 with 2 cupiris for years and no issues.

456
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:15,170
What the fuck is catmate 1?

457
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:17,110
What is that?

458
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:19,170
Catmate 1.

459
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:52,680
one is it an actual fridge or it's an ice pack why is it all ice packs um the catmate feeders have five oh my god i don't want to use ice packs i just want an actual fridge wait mini fridge like i don't understand a mini fridge is like 20 a college mini fridge is like 25 How the fuck?

460
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:55,200
Just put that technology into an auto feeder.

461
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:58,720
When did it, why did it, why is it $600?

462
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,740
Can't be that difficult if I can get a college fridge for 25.

463
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,120
It needs to be.

464
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:16,800
That's just an app.

465
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:22,640
Oh, you're right.

466
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:24,920

00:54:30,200 --> 00:55:03,180
tax oh yeah it's like the it's like the pink tax but for they're so right though i i'm willing to spend so much for i swear to god like i don't know i don't know wait no actually a pet is much cheaper i was gonna say like because like uh children live much longer uh your kid make lives much longer as they slowly drain your wallet and drain your wallet i was gonna say i don't know What's more expensive to take care of a child or a dog?

468
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:07,820
But then I realized a child can live for a very long time

469
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:59,390
And they don't have to go to college And pets don't have to go to college But they make an income at some point If they make an income What if the child What if the child is stupid What if I can't I can't rely on them to become a content creator I can't I've already hit that lottery I don't think my child can also hit the lottery too I already sucked up all the luck and it's not even that much luck what if the child's boring what if they're not entertaining

470
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:07,690

00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:21,900
Influencer child or a spoiled dog I spent so much money on dad Oh my god

472
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:40,220
The moment I think the moment he broke his back was like Was the day he won the real lottery His life changed, and he realized it can get better if I just hurt myself.

473
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:43,700

If my mom told me she adopted me because I seemed easier to take care of than a doxin, I might crash out.

493
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:00,120
No, not gonna lie.

494
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,860

01:07:11,950 --> 01:07:16,070

602
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:49,200

And then I realized it was just my It was just my client card I when I put it in the machine and go okay guys I'll figure this out I'll figure out how to buy this later if I don't worry I'll figure out I'm so tired guys this is why I need my 600 dollar fridge I need I could sleep four more hours you don't understand he's been doing this for a week No,

605
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:27,580
I don't like that.

606
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:30,680
I think I need this.

607
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:35,700
I'll do anything to sleep four more hours.

608
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:47,280
But the sleep deprivation is kicking right now.

609
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:54,060
I don't know what else I can do other than sleeping early.

610
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:56,000
But it's like there's no solutions.

611
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:59,260
There's practically zero solutions.

612
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:01,260
this problem.

613
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:09,840
I think a few cases of monsters cheaper.

614
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:11,860
Rice, thank you for the super chat.

615
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:12,360
Thank you.

01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:13,520
Thank you.

617
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:22,580
It feels like there was no other option than to buy an automatic feeder that's also a refrigerator.

618
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:26,980
There's practically no other options than that.

619
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:28,600
Zero.

620
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:29,880
Zero.

621
01:10:37,510 --> 01:10:51,050
Where can we have There's no other I can't even see another solution for this It's the only Justifiable realistic Solution to my problem If I throw enough money at something It'll work

622
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:04,300
Financial self-sabotage In the HD

623
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,880
Oh yeah Oh yeah that reminds me I might Trying out, okay.

624
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,680
Don't judge me, okay?

625
01:11:17,620 --> 01:11:19,100
Don't judge me on this.

626
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:24,420
But I've been like, okay, so you guys know how, okay, I know you guys are going to start judging.

627
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:25,780
The moment I said, don't judge me.

628
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:28,000
You guys are going to start judging me.

629
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:31,880
But anyway, so, you know how I do like pre-cooked meals?

630
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:36,680
But like, I'm not really a fan of my, because this is like this pre-cooked meal.

631
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:40,100
Like, it's only, they only work for my...

632
01:11:42,140 --> 01:12:40,420
or in my city and but the thing is uh it's like i i'm not like a huge it's like hit or miss because sometimes sometimes they like they have a set menu and they don't there's no like variety to it like i mean there is sort of variety but like it's practically like it's very boring the dishes are like very boring and and um and it's mostly geared towards like western styles so all the dishes are just Western style dishes and um and um there's a very like if I don't like a particular meal that's on like Monday or Tuesday I just don't order it but it's been happening a lot recently where I just don't order much from the pre-cooked service um just because I'm just not a fan of some of the meals they're preparing for it like the photos they show and like what they're making for that day so I was talking to a friend about it and they're like Oh,

633
01:12:40,560 --> 01:13:01,160
why don't you hire like there's like Personal chefs that you can hire To customize my menu And so I was like, you know what So I decided so I was like looking around And I was looking around And It's not that expensive It's not actually that expensive Guys,

634
01:13:01,160 --> 01:14:16,000
okay It's It basically Basically It's also another company that does and it's sort of like the pre-cooked meal service but instead it's like uh instead you can customize your menu versus you know just having a set thing each week and then you just order you just order from from the pictures they send you and like the description what the meal is for monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday and because like i feel like i was already sort of wasting my money on the pre-cooked meals um on the pre-cooked meal only because like if i'm not satisfied with the meal i just still order out or i still order out and i still like um i still order out and i still like add more food to my to my um um for to my week just because i'm just not really a fan of the food itself so i was researching about it and they do offer there's like this from another company that's in my city this is also in my city and uh you know and i would do this i do this pre-cooked meal things because i want to eat healthier

635
01:14:16,000 --> 01:15:14,120
too because when i order out for myself uh i order out myself i usually tend to avoid like you know i used to tend to avoid the healthy options and stuff like you know vegetables and stuff like that um because it's just it's not in the dish itself so when i looked at the personal chef option it was basically i paid like like a hundred and fifty dollars a week for my pre-cooked meals uh and for uh for the personal chef option it's 250 canadian dollars a week and uh and they send like personal like they customize the menu for you and they buy like fresh groceries on the day to to make your meals so i was like oh that's a i feel like that's a good deal because like sometimes if i order out If I order out and I order like an Uber Eats or whatever Sometimes I spend like $60 in one day You know,

636
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:26,880
so I was just like, oh It feels much more cheaper because Or like maybe I order, you know, I want to order something nice to eat and stuff So I order like, buy it, this is all Canadian So it's Monopoly money by the way

637
01:15:31,440 --> 01:16:37,420
It's all, it's all Monopoly money still Canadian so so I figured it'd be a lot cheaper and for health reasons because like they're flat it's like you know they plan on doing like healthier options with like vegetables and um for my diet as well as like you know adding more dairy products too um and I just wanted like a customized menu that fits my that just fits my taste buds more so I feel like for 250 a week versus uh like versus like something i can actually like like for food i actually enjoy and yeah it's like getting a home cooked meal too that's something i miss as well for like dietary restrictions and stuff yeah so to get something like just something that i can have for like um instead of just ordering out no it's for lunch and dinner they make meals for I'm doing a trial period.

638
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:40,080
I'm going to be doing a trial period for it next week

639
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:51,420
The thing is I would love to like just Order groceries and just make my own meals, but I just don't have time.

640
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:56,060
I'm always so busy So it like so like ordering uber.

641
01:16:56,340 --> 01:17:03,960
So you can see why a lot of content creators Everyone just like uber eats and like order takeout and it's so unhealthy.

642
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:53,000
It's very unhealthy long-term wise and that's but a lot of content creators do it because we just don't have a lot of time in our schedule um to cook for ourselves or to even like go outside to do grocery shopping that's why you see a lot of them which is like oh yeah I just ordered uh I just yeah I'm just waiting for my food right now and um yeah and it's such a waste of money that's also why I started doing pre-cooked meals because um it was just such a waste of money over time um always ordering all the time just because i can't go out and and like you know i just i don't have the time to go out to grab something to eat or go out to do grocery shopping and uh and like prepare my meals

643
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:17,060
oh no no i'm it's like there's i don't think fact i don't think factor works in canada i know there's like um i had some friends suggest like various pre-cooked meal service but it only exists in America.

644
01:18:21,350 --> 01:18:23,510
Is there a service that does...

645
01:18:24,270 --> 01:18:24,790
groceries?

646
01:18:25,290 --> 01:18:26,950
Yeah, they deliver groceries.

647
01:18:27,930 --> 01:18:31,170
But like I said, sometimes I just don't have time to...

648
01:18:31,170 --> 01:18:36,110
I just don't have time to cook for myself sometimes.

649
01:18:36,370 --> 01:18:38,010
Also, the dishes is so...

650
01:18:38,010 --> 01:18:39,110
Why should I just...

651
01:18:39,110 --> 01:18:40,030
It's so tiring.

652
01:18:40,790 --> 01:18:41,190
Oh!

653
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:48,240
Oh, itchy is back up now.

654
01:18:48,780 --> 01:18:50,200
Yeah, but I feel like...

655
01:18:50,220 --> 01:18:52,580
It's weird to pivot back to itch.

656
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:04,540
It's still a lot.

657
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,640
It's still a lot.

658
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:08,840
Washing dishes is so...

659
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:12,360
Cleaning up and washing dishes is so tedious.

660
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:17,300
I do have a dishwasher, though.

661
01:19:28,510 --> 01:19:29,630
I'm going to chat.

662
01:19:29,650 --> 01:19:31,950
I don't know how to be an adult sometimes.

663
01:19:32,110 --> 01:19:43,350
I think you guys might notice But I'm just doing I'm just doing a Trial period for like a week just to see how how I like it

664
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:49,840
I think it's cook unity.

665
01:19:50,420 --> 01:20:00,380
I think cook unity was the one that my one of my friends suggested to try out But they don't have cook unity in In Canada

666
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:18,240
Yeah, I just need to build a routine.

667
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:19,760
I just need to build a routine.

668
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:23,000
But I'm going to try to trial period with the chef.

669
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:25,720
And just to see how it goes.

670
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:27,580
And if it's worth the investment.

671
01:20:27,980 --> 01:20:31,800
Like, the only reason why I'm, like, trying it out.

672
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:34,660
It's because I just want to have a healthier eating style.

673
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:40,640
I just felt like, because, like, I spent so many years just ordering out because of streaming.

674
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:45,500
And, like, it felt, it was just felt so unhealthy in general.

675
01:20:46,500 --> 01:21:20,200
I live with my when my parents sorry when my parents live with me because I paid the rent when my parents live with me um even then my parents would just like order food for me like I never I didn't really get like home cooked meals they would just go out and just buy me something like they would go out to eat and just buy again I would be streaming or working and they would just um um and they would just like buy me something to eat And I didn't really get like home-cooked meals.

676
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:23,700
And even when I did get like home-cooked meals, it'll just be like something super unhealthy.

677
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:32,080
Like, you know, be like spicy noodles or like bulldog noodles or like udon.

678
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:36,020
Or udon, but like not the healthy type of udon.

679
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:39,200
Like there's a lot of like unhealthy ingredients in the udon and stuff.

680
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41,160
And stuff like that.

681
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:45,940
And I just felt like...

682
01:21:45,940 --> 01:22:57,740
I just felt very unhealthy because Because I felt like I felt like Doing that for so many years It felt like it was really bad for my body So that's why I'm trying out this personal chef Because I tried with the I tried with the pre-cooked meals But I was just It was a lot healthier It was a lot healthier and the portions were really good but but I felt like I was so bored with the variety it just felt the meals just felt so boring and like it was like at one point it just repeated itself like you know I was getting the same meals not like every week but like you know they like uh recycle the same recipe and stuff the same recipes and it wasn't like my favorite recipe too so so that's why I'm like okay I'm gonna try out this maybe like having a more customized menu would be my taste and like you know having something more customized every week might be you know might make me follow a better routine

683
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:31,740
yeah well it's not really a personal chef chef because like I think she she does like because it's a company too so they offer this apparently But it's more so like you can have a Customized menu for what you want to eat

684
01:23:36,430 --> 01:25:25,270
So it was it's like it's like 250 a week basically for the entire week $250 Canadian so But yeah, like it's just a trial period No, they just bring the food over they they basically they basically meal prep they meal they're basically meal prepping for me because it's not like every day it's not like they're cooking every day from what I read it's yeah for both lunch and dinner it's for both lunch and why does she emphasize Canadian cash is it less yes it is yes money has not been doing very well uh so it's like why does she keep emphasis yes because our currency sucks i always when i do sponsors i only accept us dollars right they're like you want to be paid canadian or america i was like no american dollars please i i have american bank accounts just so i can accept american cash the canadian money Canadian to USD okay 80 CAD to USD so 58 US dollars is 80 Canadian dollars so like whenever I buy Steam games I always be like every time I buy Steam games not

685
01:25:37,390 --> 01:26:02,390
so bad yeah but the thing is I knew what it was like before it got that bad i i knew what that was like before i knew we were very our currency was very similar to us currency and then i remember those times i the fact that it's just the fact that like i knew when it used to be good

686
01:26:07,030 --> 01:26:12,010
so it feels worse That's so much worse.

687
01:26:12,830 --> 01:26:15,530
So we used to be there with you.

688
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:31,740
Wait, no, they're planning on.

689
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:33,880
We're planning on.

690
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:45,240
It's like, I think like from what I read on the website, it's a more customized menu, but they are like, it's also sort of like meal prep too, where they do make like food in advance for some days.

691
01:26:47,420 --> 01:26:49,680
So like, and all you have to do is just reheat it.

692
01:26:52,840 --> 01:27:23,440
so it's not like every day is like they cook it fresh every day um it's like they're all it's also sort of like meal prep and too i don't know i don't know we'll see we'll see how it goes if i don't like it i'll go back to the pre-cooked meals it's just more if i go back to pre-cooked meals it's a hundred dollars cheaper and um yeah it's a hundred dollars cheaper and i know what i'm getting like every week but it's just more so of like i just want to try and be more healthy in terms of With the time I have,

693
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:25,040
I just want to try to be more healthy.

694
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:38,400
Yeah, and I get to have it more tailored to what I want to eat and stuff.

695
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:48,620
But imagine cooking for yourself.

696
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:54,880
I'm very limited to what I can and can't cook.

697
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:08,250
Yeah, I want to next up, like, I do want to start being more, like, be more active with exercising and stuff too.

698
01:28:08,270 --> 01:28:10,130
I've just been so busy.

699
01:28:10,370 --> 01:28:11,650
It's been really tiring lately.

700
01:28:12,690 --> 01:28:14,550
That's something I want to move up to as well.

701
01:28:24,850 --> 01:28:28,970
For those who don't know why I'm like a little bubble child, it's because I was a bubble child.

702
01:28:32,810 --> 01:28:45,270
For those who actually don't know, who are more newer to my streams or newer to me, growing up, growing up, I was very, very sheltered.

703
01:28:45,690 --> 01:29:12,390
um so like so like all my parents wanted me to do was study study and um and uh do after school like and just do after school activities like participate in sports or do clubs and stuff like that like do anything to be to like up my college resume like up my like college application so

704
01:29:15,690 --> 01:30:36,130
middle school to high school was mostly like extra yeah extracurriculars it was just studying in extracurriculars so i wasn't allowed to touch the stove until i graduated high school because then they're like oh she has to live by herself yeah i was an only i i am an only child so they're like they wouldn't let me touch the stove or like the oven or anything they wouldn't let me like touch anything that requires fire so um i never learned how to cook until i graduated high school because at that time they're like oh shit like she has to live by herself so we have to teach her how to operate a stove so that's when i first learned how to cook and um and because they're like i didn't have to do chores because they're my parents were like just study or like do you know do your extracurriculars or like because i culture my entire time every week was basically uh basically i was either you know i was either doing my doing sports stuff like doing like you know,

705
01:30:36,490 --> 01:30:45,910
I was in soccer, volleyball, basketball, soccer, basketball, volleyball, and field.

706
01:30:46,370 --> 01:30:48,590
So I was in the team for all of those sports.

707
01:30:49,550 --> 01:30:55,310
And so, you know, it would be like two hours of practice after school whenever it's soccer season or basketball season.

708
01:30:56,190 --> 01:31:00,170
So my entire year was basically like I had clubs to go to.

709
01:31:00,730 --> 01:31:02,170
I did a lot of different clubs.

710
01:31:02,270 --> 01:31:54,330
It was just all to like, you know, did community service a lot i uh i um i had i won i for two years in a row for two years in a row in middle school i had the most community service hours done out of the entire uh middle school so i was just like yeah i was like college application maxing yeah i did shot put discus and javelin for the track and field team um i also got the track team but then I was like no because I hated running I hated running they're like you got into the track team I was like no I rap I rather throw

711
01:31:58,510 --> 01:32:08,090
I rather throw I don't want to run I don't but then you're like wait but you were I was the goalie in soccer I did not have to run.

712
01:32:09,410 --> 01:32:12,330
Because I had, that's why I was really good at FPS games.

713
01:32:12,950 --> 01:32:17,970
Um, I was really good at FPS games because I had, uh, yeah, running for fun.

714
01:32:18,070 --> 01:32:19,230
Are you fucking crazy?

715
01:32:19,630 --> 01:32:22,550
Like, are you Tau Lulu?

716
01:32:23,010 --> 01:32:26,270
Like, running in my free time?

717
01:32:26,310 --> 01:32:27,970
What the fuck is wrong with you?

718
01:32:30,790 --> 01:32:35,990
Anyway, so, um, that's why I was really good at, that's why I'm really good at FPS games.

719
01:32:36,010 --> 01:33:29,250
because i have really good hand-eye coordination in general so uh my hand-eye coordination is really really good so that's uh so which helps a lot in playing video games too so i was the goalkeeper and then um for basketball i was i told for those who didn't know uh i talked about this before but i was i played center for basketball even though i wasn't the tallest but it's because I could jump really high and I also it's not that much running because it's smaller the court the court is a lot smaller versus like actual running I was really good at rebounds like when I had to grab the rebounds I basically can out grab out grab rebounds for like against other teams because I can jump really high um that'd be like

720
01:33:34,130 --> 01:34:54,130
um um so yeah so basically my time a lot of my free time was spent on you know it's crazy i used to go outside so much now look at me now it's like it's like uh it's like it's like it's like groundhog day where like people like oh is the groundhog coming up it's like me i'm like oh my today we might find out if Doki is gonna come out of her cave of her little hole if she comes out of the hole that means there's uh and she sees her shadow that means we're gonna have winter's gonna end soon so um anyway anyway um so yeah like i wasn't allowed to do much adult learning stuff like actual like learning how to be an adult because my parents sheltered me so much growing up like i didn't have to do laundry like they're like you know i don't have to do laundry i didn't have to clean anything um all i did was just focus on my studies and focus on my extracurriculars or and also like get be on the pc too um and also like you know Be able to be on the PC and stuff.

721
01:34:54,810 --> 01:34:56,090
So, um...

722
01:34:57,590 --> 01:34:58,070
Um...

723
01:34:58,070 --> 01:35:02,250
So, because of that, I didn't learn a lot of life skills growing up.

724
01:35:02,490 --> 01:35:07,970
And even as I got older, um...

725
01:35:07,970 --> 01:35:13,630
Even as I got older, and, you know, I went to college, I had to learn a lot of these things.

726
01:35:14,870 --> 01:35:15,830
Um, like...

727
01:35:15,830 --> 01:35:18,230
I had to learn a lot of, like, life skills stuff.

728
01:35:19,030 --> 01:35:19,510
Um...

729
01:35:21,110 --> 01:35:22,070
Like, uh...

730
01:35:22,090 --> 01:35:32,690
within like a week basically before I had to live by myself so like my mom was trying to teach me how to do laundry and and like teaching me how to operate the stove well when I was like

731
01:35:36,410 --> 01:35:36,870
18.

732
01:35:36,870 --> 01:35:52,310
no I had to learn a lot of this when I was 18 basically like actual life skills um and like and I didn't even really and they but they never really taught me how to clean general.

733
01:35:53,670 --> 01:36:02,830
And even then when I was in college, my parents would visit me like every couple of months just to check up on me too.

734
01:36:03,010 --> 01:36:05,350
So I was like very sheltered and stuff.

735
01:36:05,530 --> 01:36:08,410
So they'll be and then if they see it's dirty, they'll just clean up my place.

736
01:36:09,910 --> 01:36:20,310
And then, you know, when I started living by myself after college, my parents moved in with me.

737
01:36:25,370 --> 01:36:40,910
I still pay the rent too by the way I paid the rent After college My parents moved in with me And because of that You know I learned even less I learned even less on how to I didn't even learn how to Take care of myself

738
01:36:45,650 --> 01:37:12,990
And then now Now I live by myself and uh i live by myself but i was sort of like thrusted into learning how to live by myself and how to deal with the adult world because my parents never taught me how to do taxes or anything or like how to actually clean my apartment

739
01:37:16,910 --> 01:37:51,320
so i'm trying to learn how to be an adult step by step and all this happened like and it's been a year it's been it's been a year since then since i started living by myself like actually living living by myself and uh figuring out how to do all of this very late in life yeah i had to grow up very fast

Oh my gosh.

770
01:42:54,980 --> 01:43:00,080
I think it's just because I haven't done a chatting stream in a long time, just because of how busy I've been.

771
01:43:01,620 --> 01:43:05,900
It's just nice to just hang out with my drag wounds and just chat with you guys.

I need to learn how to yapp again.

775
01:43:26,520 --> 01:43:27,640
Oh, oh, no.

776
01:43:29,260 --> 01:44:21,860
oh yeah did you guys see the the uh i i never keep up with nintendo direct because they're always so fucking early and you know i i'm not even a human at that time when they do the nintendo direct but i thought it was really funny because like their closing their closing trailer was um their closing trailer was for fire emblem and everyone was like people were like so disappointed or like oh my god but like it's but like it's only NA that's uh disappointed um at fire emblem because people like no apparent no one cares in NA about fire emblem but the thing is fire emblem is like one of the best-selling series that nintendo has ever done but only in asia

777
01:44:26,220 --> 01:44:35,120
It's like, it's their best-selling series, but like, in Asia, like, in NA, like, it's not as pop.

778
01:44:35,220 --> 01:44:37,380
I think, I think, I don't know why, though.

779
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:44,620
There's, like, because, why is Fire Emblem not popular in, um, in NA?

780
01:44:50,180 --> 01:44:51,740
NA's too stupid.

781
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:39,480
you know what i'm so salty about they never make a localization for yokai watch i'm so sad about that i've always wanted to play um i think they only did like they only done the ds games but they didn't do like a console yokai watch localization and that makes me so sad i fucking i want i love watch anime series I've always I've always wanted to try to console games out

782
01:45:46,450 --> 01:46:05,310
Patrick has to think of a super chat thank you thank you because it went from being essentially a smash IP to being everywhere and the swarming half of smash DLC I guess that's what makes the smash people I heard someone I saw a tweet was like smash smash the irreparable damage to five

783
01:46:08,830 --> 01:46:10,350
What is Yo-Kai Watch?

784
01:46:10,510 --> 01:46:11,530
It's basically...

785
01:46:11,530 --> 01:46:15,610
Okay, Yo-Kai Watch was actually so fucking popular in Asia.

786
01:46:15,730 --> 01:46:18,070
Because when I used to live in Asia, it was everywhere.

787
01:46:18,190 --> 01:46:20,190
Like, there was so much merchandising.

788
01:46:21,050 --> 01:46:26,250
And, like, there was so much merchandising and collabs of Yo-Kai Watch coming out.

789
01:46:26,590 --> 01:46:27,430
When it was...

790
01:46:27,430 --> 01:46:28,230
When it first came...

791
01:46:28,230 --> 01:46:30,390
Like, when Yo-Kai Watch first came out.

792
01:46:30,790 --> 01:46:31,910
It was literally everywhere.

793
01:46:32,270 --> 01:46:32,910
It was huge.

794
01:46:32,970 --> 01:46:35,270
It was basically, like, the next Pokemon.

795
01:46:35,330 --> 01:47:02,150
back then and um but then it never got the localization or the popularity um that it deserved in NA and now I don't know now I feel like I feel like yokai watch fell off really hard because I don't think they like capitalized on it well like Pokemon they didn't like I guess they didn't like they didn't release enough games to capitalize off of yokai watch it was technically known as

796
01:47:06,430 --> 01:47:17,330
I think my favorite, my favorite yokai and yokai watch was, I talked about it before, but my favorite yokai and yokai watch is manji mutt.

797
01:47:19,010 --> 01:47:25,510
Because it's like, it's basically, it's what he looks like.

798
01:47:28,230 --> 01:47:33,870
It's basically a salary, like a dog with the face of a salary man.

799
01:47:34,230 --> 01:47:41,390
And then it like, It like Yo-Kai evolve into Dan Doodle and this is what Dan Doodle looks like.

800
01:47:41,550 --> 01:47:45,650
I fucking, I love, I love Main Jeep.

801
01:47:46,210 --> 01:47:54,570
And so this is, okay, this is Yo-Kai Watch and it Digi-Volves into Dan Doodle.

802
01:47:55,030 --> 01:47:57,370
And this is what Dan Doodle looks like.

803
01:47:58,890 --> 01:48:05,310
It's like, it's my favorite Yo-Kai because he looks so, he looks so fucking stupid.

804
01:48:05,330 --> 01:49:06,050
fit um oh wait wait wait okay and then he evolves okay oh wait there's multi mud what's the difference between multi mud and dan doodle okay wait what the fuck is wait then how does okay is one of the yokai required to unlock dan doodle i love dan doodle yeah he evolves to rich I guess he bro went from salary man to influencer yes it was it was everywhere I would go to a mall and then it was just yoga wash everywhere in the mall attractive young dog and then he and then he discovers and then reality hits him and then he becomes a salary man Oh,

805
01:49:06,270 --> 01:49:13,110
yeah, this is before he and then he gets promoted to become CEO This is my favorite yokai

806
01:49:16,150 --> 01:49:33,230
He reached his P Level 1 salary man versus level 100 CEO Oh my god, wait, I saw someone tweeted about this But apparently if I said Alexa or

02:44:27,870 --> 02:44:31,210
Or should I just be like, Duchess Dorkybird and Sir Dorky...

1308
02:44:31,870 --> 02:44:37,070
