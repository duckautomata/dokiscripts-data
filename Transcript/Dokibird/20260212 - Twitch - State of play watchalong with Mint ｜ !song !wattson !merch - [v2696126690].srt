00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,000
She's holding a statue now.

38
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,460
And then there's like a fox that has a green tail.

Oh, she does.

59
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,440

That's the newest character.

64
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,740
She's like a fire lady.

Wait, they added Snake?

110
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,360
I learned how to skip forward.

111
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,080
Snake has always been nice.

112
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,160
You know, they added Snake in here.

113
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,600

It's at the end.

116
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,460
Snake just appears in the end.

117
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,520
What do you mean?

118
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,880

this phone has like 2x, doesn't it?

123
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,840
Which combines alien technology and humans' ability to plot
your best path.

124
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,280
I think I'm current now.

125
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,160
Do you see...

126
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,000
You don't see...

127
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,720
It's a flowchart.

128
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,720
I see a flowchart.

129
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,880
Do you see a flowchart?

130
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,380
Everyone votes to change the next mission.

131
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:55,480
Yeah.

132
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,200
Once you've chosen a node...

133
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,680
See his spaceship getting blown up.

134
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,640
Oh yeah, you're behind.

135
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,660
You're still behind.

136
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,960
I'm still in the future.

137
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:09,080
Resources or even rescue survivors that can offer cool
upgrades for your gear, all while trying to avoid the

138
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,500
illegal This feels very arc-free.

139
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,240
Yeah, I thought 5G was the future.

140
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,380
We've worked hard to ensure that there are tons of items to
choose from.

141
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,640
Sorry, I meant a skill tree.

142
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,380
Like, you know what?

143
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,240
So, Doki, I'm watching this with a hound.

144
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,320
You have hounds, hounds, hounds.

145
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,620
What the fuck is going on?

146
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,040
It's with teleporting anyone who touches it.

147
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,220
My favorite part is that you're just cutting in and out ever
so often.

148
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,220
All the various enemies, weapons, items, and mission
objectives.

149
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:34,680
Oh, sorry.

150
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,180
Sorry, guys, I'm on my phone.

151
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,360
Dynamic ways that create emergent gameplay and endless
replayable.

152
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,620
Yeah, she's getting ready for her.

153
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,100
Yeah, you can't miss out.

154
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,260
This is the most highly anticipated state of play in the
last two months.

155
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,980
Yeah, they're gonna talk about Metal Gear and also about
Bloodborne 2.

156
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,420
You can't miss out.

157
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,620
Oh, yeah, Devil May Cry 6.

158
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,820
And if you do die, don't work.

159
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,240
So long as one of you makes it back.

160
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,180
Yeah, Devil May Cry 6 is gonna be announced.

161
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,880
Yeah, guys, trust, trust.

162
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:14,220
The home base is a place for your team to readjust their
strategy we're gonna get that now i saw a flowchart yeah

163
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:21,520
sorry i missed skill tree each active probability map
culminates in one of multiple boss battles this is the

164
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:31,860
scanner boss this looks very arc reader's like scans for
flux deposits to harvest it feels like he was bones i don't

165
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:39,100
even remember where you're at right now i see a giant cube
in the sky rotates like a 3d puzzle you want to spread out

166
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,340
and attack it from all sides.

167
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,380
Oh, I'm looking at a giant cube.

168
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,380
Oh, just seeing the cube and laser grids.

169
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,140
I think I'm too stupid for that kind of puzzling.

170
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,440
Yeah, I know me too.

171
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,500
Where every run has you yelling and laughing and saying, I
can't believe that just happened.

172
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,880

I heard you're playing Bioshock right now.

190

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,980
I'm fucking course not.

199
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,580
Of course I killed them.

200
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,420
Wait, did I?

201
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:46,940
No, no.

202
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:53,760
We actually, I wanted to kill them and then my chat bribed
me to keep them alive because they wanted the good ending

203
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,800
because they're cowards.

204
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:57,860
Oh, cowards.

205
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,180
Yeah, I made a pull.

206
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,520
I made a pull.

207
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,840
I wanted to kill them for loot and then I made a pull and
got bribed to keep them alive.

208
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,520
Six survivors of Raccoon City are all dead from the same
thing.

209
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,780
Yeah, that's not good.

210
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,540
Oh, is that Resident Evil 9?

211
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,640
Oh my god, Leon.

212
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,680
The Rhodes Hill Chronic Care Center.

214
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,280
Are you at Resident Evil now?

215
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,100

216
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,180
Yeah.

217
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,400
He's like pulling up in his car.

218
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,460
Holy shit.

219
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:31,920
Oh, yeah.

220
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,920
I saw that monster.

221
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,780
I did, I went to, I went to New York.

222
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,180
Uh, I did like a demo for the Resident Evil 9.

223
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,900
And the monsters are like, it feels very...

224
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,380
It's very scary when you're playing as a girl.

225
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:52,560
You...

226
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,020
You...

227
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:54,680
You...

228
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,760
Leon's infected?

229
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,500
Leon got molded!

230
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,660
Yeah, he got... He has the mold!

231
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,480
He has the mold!

232
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,720
A former T-virus researcher.

233
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,840
No, I don't believe it.

234
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,980
Look at this hand!

235
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,140
The mold got him!

236
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,780
See this is what happens when you still live in your fucking
black mold apartment.

237
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,100
The mold's gonna get you.

238
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,800
That's not zombie mold.

239
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,720
That's black mold.

240
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,060
But you don't know.

241
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,600
It could mutate.

242
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,340
It could mutate like the last of us.

243
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,520
It could become the patient's hero.

244
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:41,800
Oh my god.

245
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,920
Imagine if Resident Evil 9 was

246
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,000
Oh.

247
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,780
You evil.

248
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,440
That'd be crazy.

249
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,400
Leona's plant zombie.

00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,060

Is this Bloodboard?

280
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:32,180
This is like anti-bloodboard.

00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:37,700
They have RPG Tactics Bloodboard?

282
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,600
I can't believe they've made Bloodboard.

283
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,860
It only launches this year.

284
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,360
And you can wishlist it starting to do.

285
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,200
Yeah, they went with a totally new direction.

286
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:48,860
Yeah, they went with a totally new direction.

287
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,720
Blu-ray 2, right?

288
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:56,360
It felt like that's what gamers really wanted from
Bloodborne and RPG tactics.

289
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,200
An anime girl.

290
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,620
Yeah, an anime girl.

291
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,720
That's what we were missing.

292
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,960
That's why it took so long for Bloodborne 2 to come out,
guys.

293
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,920
They had to, they had to like redo the entire concept.

294
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,220
Wait, is that the...

295
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,360
Yeah, there were some intercourse.

296
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,440
Oh my god, that's the Polyball!

297
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,140
That's the Beach Girl game!

298
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:19,720
I'm not fading.

299
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,680
I'm not fading man.

300
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:26,330
I'm not remember the beach girl games, but like now it's
actually but it's like this is the main series though

301
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:41,380
But like the unfun version of dead or alive You know I've
always wondered not the last half not the actual game

302
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,320
Fine, they're still they're still hot

303
00:17:53,160 --> 00:18:01,120
I'm really upset that Dead or Alive is not, you cannot get
Dead or the main series games of Dead or Alive on American

304
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:01,340
Steam.

305
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:04,840
You can?

306
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,700
You can't.

307
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:12,040
You have to like buy it from the Asia Steam store or like
get a physical copy somewhere.

308
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:14,780
Oh.

309
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:19,060
Yeah, you can't actually play Dead or Alive like the good
version.

310
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,940
Oh no!

311
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,860
At least they're still sexy.

312
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,840
At least they're still dead or alive.

313
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,320
Which one?

314
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,960

The game-changing sequel to Control.

340
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,100

our in-development.

Boomborn.

380
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:43,790
Yeah, this feels Doom and Bloodborne-ish.

381
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:55,310
Crimson Moon.

382
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,750

383
00:23:59,210 --> 00:23:59,590
Ooh.

384
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:03,030
It's his period.

385
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:09,050
Oh shit.

386
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,230
Monster Hunter?

387
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:15,250
What is this?

388
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,640
Oh, yeah!

389
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,300
I forgot about that.

390
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:28,160
Yeah, Game Freak is finally making a new game that's not
Pokemon.

391
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,820
Did you hear about that?

392
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,180
I did, yeah, yeah.

393
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:34,120
Yeah.

394
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,740
And people were like, why doesn't my Pokemon look like this?

395
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,760
Because it's actually, and like, it's gonna be...

396
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,680
I mean, it's a valid question.

397
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:52,480
Like, you remember how like the newest Pokemon game, the big
ass city is all like, one 3d file or some shit did you see

398
00:24:52,480 --> 00:25:04,780
that tweet no yeah so like the that's that big city in the
newest pokemon game is just all one one giant model and

399
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,060
people were like what the fuck

400
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:23,820
oh it was fake oh my god people lying on the internet i
can't believe it yeah you fell for it i can't Oh, it's all

401
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,100
coming with the people.

402
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,340
That's cute.

403
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:30,860
That's cute.

404
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:37,600
I think it's also because like Pokemon has to come, like new
Pokemon games have to come out every one to two years.

405
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,540
Well, they're pushing those out.

406
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,580
Yeah, they're pushing out really fast.

407
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,400
I think this, apparently this game took a long time in
development.

408
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,560
Thanks to Fictions and Game Freak for that new look at
characters and content.

409
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:56,280
in beast of reincarnation it's coming to ps5 this summer it
looks really good i'm surprised it's not coming on the

Yeah, Disney is coming in with a new horror game.

423
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,560
That's true.

424
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,560
I'm pretty sure they did make an indie horror game.

425
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,840
game of Steamboat Willie.

426
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,040

Release date is on the horizon.

430
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,680

You know the Hollow Knight?

432
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:32,340
You know the Hollow Knight?

433
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,500
That's why Hollow's in the game name.

434
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,120
Saw.

435
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,480

He escaped the factory.

498
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,560

00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,220

Yes, chicken board.

505
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,540
But there's so many enemies.

506
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,780
That's, that's, that's war.

507
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,640
Oh yeah, you're right.

Because I can't tell it's pre-rendered or gameplay.

513
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,460
Usually it says, right?

514
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,980
They'll say like, this is pre-rendered footage, right?

515
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:38,960
It would say, no, usually it would say this one is captured
on the PS5, but then it didn't say that.

516
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,740
Yeah, you're right.

517
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,260
Yeah, so then I'm like, this feels all pre-rendered.

518
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,920
So I don't know if that's actual gameplay.

519
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,320
You're right.

520
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,280
Because the other ones was like captured on the PS5.

521
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,200
Oh, Lucasfilm?

522
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,940
Yeah, see pre-alpha in-game capture on PS5.

523
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,260
Welcome to the Galactic League.

524
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,680
Oh, I am still behind.

525
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:01,120
Yeah.

526
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,920
Why not take part in a friendly exhibition race?

527
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,580
Wait, is this part racing?

528
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,160
Oh, my God.

529
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,720
I saw, I remember I saw this trailer.

530
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,340
in the game awards.

531
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,860
Oh, wait, this is Star Wars?

532
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:15,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

533
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:16,340
Pod Racing.

534
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,240
Wait, are you watching the YouTube or the Twitch?

535
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,460
YouTube?

536
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,700
You should watch the Twitch.

537
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:27,840
I don't know if you'll buffer on the Twitch, though, but the
Twitch was always, like, synced up.

538
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,140
Okay, I don't know if I have the Twitch app when you do.

539
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:33,680
Oh, yeah.

540
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,840
I'm looking forward to now the Pod Racing.

541
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,860
God racing.

542
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,020
Is this blood point in space?

543
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:49,360
If they weren't holding me back right now, I have you frozen
in carbonate.

544
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:53,100
Guys, next up is Devil May Cry 6, guys.

We're real.

546
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:57,120
They're saving it all on the last 15 minutes.

547
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:57,680
Blast.

548
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,240
Blast.

549
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,680
Wait, how do I watch it?

550
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:04,920

551
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,320
Or who's hosting?

552
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,040
Oh, it's Stata Play.

553
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,220

Iceland.

560
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:50,330
I strongly believe that there is a need for such heart and
intuition in modern spycraft.

561
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:52,710
I have a feeling this is not Idris' elbow.

562
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:58,010
I need I state the obvious.

563
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:00,650
He is not ready.

564
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,230
James, the service is over.

565
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:05,930
You're a rare breed.

566
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:08,010
Are they still in England?

567
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:10,850
I mean, I hope so.

568
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:15,370
There was a UK flag, I saw it, I saw it.

569
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:21,330
I was gonna say, I hope the agency is still based in the
United Kingdom.

570
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:22,730
Housekeeping, I presume.

571
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:27,210
You seem the kind of guy who knows what he likes.

572
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:29,530
So you won't do anything stupid.

573
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:36,690
Agents are very sure.

574
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:37,850
And there's still ladies in there.

575
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:40,110
Of course, there's always bond girls.

576
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:41,750

577
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:51,590

580
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:12,560
That explains it.

581
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,520
I manage the game content team within third-party portfolio.

582
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,680
We evaluate games coming from publishers all over the world
from Indie to AAA.

583
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:23,300
Those of us in the third-party portfolio team travel the
world and meet with our partners.

584
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,580
And it's even more exciting for me when those partners have
been foundational to my own love of videos.

585
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,080
Guys, this is it.

Okay, actually, that's...

589
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:36,720
A lot of people remember Konami for being with PlayStation
in the very beginning.

590
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,980
Wait, what is Konami?

591

It's diving!

612
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:40,110
Liquid's goal is to seize control of SRP.

613
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:41,790

Nukes.

They're bringing nukes into Costa Rica.

624
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:46,030
We are not allowed to bear arms.

625
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:47,410

00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:01,830

694
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:05,090
What what is this?

695
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:07,090
What am I looking at?

696
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:18,550
A triple to a snake from an octopus Darwin practical octopus
Oh, this is the game.

697
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:24,950
Okay, so Konami was like putting out this game and it looked
literally like Metal Gear, but if it was an octopus.

698
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:29,010
And so I guess they're doing a collab now.

699
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:33,530
Decoy octopus.

700
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:35,530
Wait, he has ears.

701
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:39,230
So cute, though.

702
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:41,010
Wait, does that look like fun?

703
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:44,070
The graphics are insane.

704
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:53,870
I know they look so good for like a joke it looks like a
joke game Like a parody game.

705
00:42:54,150 --> 00:43:00,370
Yeah, no, there was like it was like a real game And now I
guess they have like an official Metal Gear thing.

706
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:08,670
Yeah, that's fine What the heck what the fuck Darwin's
paradox play the demo tomorrow?

707
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:15,430
I wonder what's a sequel then yeah, oh Castlevania No way.

708
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:16,230
Yeah.

709
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,630
40th anniversary is this year, apparently.

710
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:20,670
Go on the octopus.

711
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:21,630
Hold on.

712
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:22,910
Hold on.

713
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:23,750
Don't spoil it.

714
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:27,510
You think attacked by rats, okay?

715
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:31,090
Are you back on the YouTube video?

716
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:33,210
Yeah, I had to.

717
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:33,830
Yeah, I was.

718
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:34,630
Because Metal Gear was happening.

719
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:41,110
Castlevania 40th.

720
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:42,970
Wait, this is not happening, isn't it?

721
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:44,810
No, no, no.

722
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:46,390
It's a new game.

723
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:53,110
Oh, looks really good.

724
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:55,070
Does look good.

725
00:43:55,570 --> 00:44:00,870
Yeah, it's like the same gameplay style, but just with new,
better graphics.

726
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:03,130
Yeah, give me my whip, baby.

727
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:04,330
Like size throw there.

728
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:07,410
Oh, okay, that bomb.

729
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:08,170
Yeah, let's get it.

730
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:11,350
We're gonna get to the boss decides and it actually looks
really sick.

731
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:13,570
I'm excited.

732
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:18,530
I mean, the anime is also pretty good.

733
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:19,550
Not the newest season.

734
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:24,130
You know, you guys would, if you guys ever watched the
newest season of Castlevania, it's pretty ass.

735
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:25,490
Oh no!

736
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:28,530
Oh no!

737
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:31,230
Oh, it's by the devs of Dead, uh, Dead Cells.

738
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:34,130
Aww.

739
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:38,970
Yeah, it looks good.

740
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:44,230
Thank you, Konami, for bringing back.

741
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:49,370
They're finally using their IPs again.

742
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:50,630
Oh, my God.

743
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:56,870
There's so many new well-mocking premieres.

744
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:00,370
No more Pachinko.

745
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:07,070
They're taking a break from Pachinko, guys.

746
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:09,330
What'd you say?

747
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:12,250
They're finally taking a break from Pachinko.

748
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:13,250
I know.

749
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:15,250
We won.

750
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:16,130
We won.

751
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:17,730
Gamers rise up.

752
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:19,030
Your voice matters.

753
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:22,190
Series.

754
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:30,730
Alright, next is Devil May Cry.

755
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:32,190
But Konami have a moment.

756
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:32,650
Devil May Cry.

757
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:33,290
Yeah.

758
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:34,770
Yeah.

759
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:37,510
But Konami have a moment.

760
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:39,110
I love this comment.

761
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,230
It's almost like, Konami.

762
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:45,230
Konami needs to make more games so they can make more
Pachinko machines.

763
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:50,230
They're right out of IPs.

764
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:55,250
They'll release another Metal Gear patchy slot.

765
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:01,870
Simon doesn't do me.

766
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:04,250
What's this?

767
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:05,670
You can't stay in this room forever.

768
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,230
Is this Devil May Cry 6?

769
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:10,510
I can't stay in this room forever.

770
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:12,610
It is.

771
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:13,170
Silent Hill?

772
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:13,710
No, it's Castle.

773
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:14,890
It's going to be hard.

774
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:15,510
Oh, hell.

775
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:20,530
Wait, I wonder if the Bluebird team game...

776
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:20,710
Oh, wait.

777
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:21,890
When does that get announced?

778
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:22,610
I'll remember.

779
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:25,590
It was announced in Game Awards.

780
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:27,390
Oh, it is Silent Hill.

781
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:28,230
Come back to Silent Hill.

782
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:30,210
Did you just say come back to Silent Hill?

783
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:33,610
I don't know.

784
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:34,330
I don't have sound.

785
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:34,810
Oh, yeah.

786
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:37,290
You just see a radio.

787
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:40,150
You're just like, why did he pick up the radio?

788
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:44,190
I woke up in the water again.

789
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:46,050
No, this is Left 4 Dead.

790
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:47,130
I don't know.

791
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:50,570
But this time it's...

792
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:51,850
Well, it's pretty foggy.

793
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:52,630
I think it's Silent Hill.

794
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:53,990
St. Amelia?

795
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:55,450
That's not Silent Hill.

796
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:00,130
Foggy, of course it is.

797
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:01,670
It's the only place where fog happened.

798
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:03,650
Yeah, but it's St. Amelia.

799
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:06,810
That's a different city.

800
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:10,950
So was Silent Hill at?

801
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:23,340

805
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,900
It's very Silent Hill 5-V.

806
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,020
Jesus Christ.

807
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:55,360
Okay, there's gonna be a scene where you're gonna be like,
What the fuck?

808
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:57,560
Oh.

809
00:47:58,220 --> 00:47:59,720
I don't think I'm there yet.

810
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:02,700
The water.

811
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:09,630
Where is this?

812
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:12,070
Silent Hill Townfall.

813
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:13,870
Oh, it is Silent Hill.

814
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:15,730
They're in a new town.

815
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:17,510
The new hill?

816
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:20,610
Sound like it was spreading, I guess.

817
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:22,890
Yeah, it's a mindset.

818
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:26,610
Oh my god, another Konami game?

819
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:29,110
Wait, seriously?

820
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:31,610
Yeah, yeah, there's so many IPs!

821
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:32,910
Holy fuck!

822
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:36,190
This is like the Konami of Konami play.

823
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:39,190
Not Seda plays, Konami of play.

824
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:41,650
Seda Konami.

825
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:44,110
Devil may cry.

826
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:47,150
Yeah, so that they can make a party slot.

827
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:51,050
Konami bought the IP of Double May Cry.

828
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:54,670
The state of Konami.

829
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:56,190
The world is shrouded by light fall.

830
00:48:57,930 --> 00:48:59,710
I wonder if it's a new...

831
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:01,890
Konami doing videos that aren't Yu-Gi-Oh!

832
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:03,190
This is the new Yu-Gi-Oh game.

833
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:03,790
Trust.

834
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:07,070
It might be.

835
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:08,050
New Yu-Gi-Oh!

836
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:09,210
Spin, spin up.

837
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:14,690
I refuse to accept an ending like this.

838
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:16,270
Oh, Code Vane.

839
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:16,810
Oh my god.

840
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:18,930
Kingdom Hearts rocks us.

841
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:22,970
Konami fought the Kingdom Hearts IP.

842
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:24,610
Oh, I'm buffering now too.

843
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:27,550
What?

844
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:28,610
Is this a...

845
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:29,690
Is this new?

846
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:31,730
No, it's Code Vane, apparently.

847
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:32,730
Come on.

848
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:33,690
Oh, again.

849
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:35,070
Oh wait, Code Vane?

850
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:35,530
Yeah.

851
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:41,070
There's a new RPG game.

852
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:44,750
Expedition 33 anime edition.

853
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:52,700
Oh my god, the anime reskin.

854
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:55,960
Those were her majesty's words.

855
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,740
Oh, it's not Cobain?

856
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:58,840
Wait, what is it?

857
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:01,640
It's stop the light fall.

858
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:04,700
Dot hack.

859
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:10,100
I don't know anything about... I don't know anything about
RPG, JRPGs.

860
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:15,200
Rev is... No, no, it's Rev Noir.

861
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:17,520
Rev Noir.

862
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:19,620
What is Rev Noir?

863
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:20,440
Is that new IP?

864
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,160
Oh, new IP.

865
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:24,280
Okay, see?

866
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,280

868
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,020
Reb Noir.

869
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:45,920
When the hoax sparks catastrophe, I think Devil May Cry
might be last.

870
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:47,180
Yeah, I think so too.

871
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,200
They always say it's the best game for this.

872
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,160
Yeah, in the last...

873
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:55,480
Imagine it's Bloodborne 2 and Devil May Cry.

874
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:59,860
In the last nine minutes, it's like Bloodborne 2 Devil May
Cry.

875
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:04,780
Kingdom Hearts 4.

876
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:05,940
Kingdom Hearts 4, yeah.

877
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,080
Last nine minutes, trust guys.

878
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,600
I got the Metal Gear one right.

879
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:22,340
Well, it's funny because like people predicted Metal Gear

We're just talking about John Wick.

886
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:32,820
John Wick video game, so...

887
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:37,300
Oh my god, you can actually be John Wick and Alan Wick!

888
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:38,420
Stable.

889
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:39,840
Constant.

890
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:42,800
It's actually Alan Wick?

891
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,320
And then about three.

892
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:48,120
Yay.

893
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,300
Writing was too boring.

894
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:52,540
Okay.

895
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:56,640
I want to see them like walk up to each other and do the
spider-man meme

896
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:05,450
Already so oh my god, no they can't make a John Wick video
game.

897
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:09,530
I'm gonna lose my mom I think it's already too late man.

898
00:53:09,570 --> 00:53:10,930
I think they're already way in.

899
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:12,150
Oh my god.

900
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:17,030
It's actually his face It's actually Keanu Reeves

901
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:27,450
It's real Keanu They got him in the video games.

902
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:30,590
That means if he dies in the game, he dies in real life.

903
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:32,910
He's canon, guys.

904
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:34,190
He's real.

905
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:37,770
Wait.

906
00:53:38,530 --> 00:53:41,090
There's no way we still have four more minutes.

907
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:43,270
Or five more minutes of...

908
00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:45,210
That can't be...

909
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:45,870
Is that the...

910
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:48,950
There's no way to end with Marathon after John Wick.

911
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:52,070
There's no way.

912
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:54,610
The end with an extraction.

913
00:53:55,270 --> 00:54:08,190
now oh my god what's marathon it's another extraction
shooter from the people who made destiny dreams endure okay

914
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:17,730
so small among the stars breathe softly there's no way like
john wick should have been the ending trailer there's no

915
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:20,330
fucking way there has to be a trailer after marathon

916
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:35,810
you know what i'm surprised we didn't get like a marvel
thing that's true i think that they already but they

917
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:42,230
announced the wolverine game already in the in the past
state of place i feel like they're just like we don't need

918
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:53,810
to really announce it again we'll know if we get like some
pop song that's true well i won't know i can't hear it but

919
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:56,190
we're out singing the song to you I hear it.

920
00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:57,550
I hear it.

921
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:01,870
We've had to do things to survive.

922
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:04,190
Things I never would have.

923
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:07,990
How do I skip to Devil May Cry?

924
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:10,850
We're all monsters.

925
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:14,290
She's already checked out of the trailer.

926
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:16,270
She's like, I've seen enough.

927
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:21,730
Embrace.

928
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:25,250
I think it's a good thing.

929
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:28,390
criminal that they put marathon right after John Wick.

930
00:55:31,450 --> 00:55:31,750
Yeah.

931
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:37,550
How could they do this through the marathon?

932
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:42,030
That's the fact that they have to follow up on the John Wick
trailer.

933
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:45,330
Imagine if they didn't know what was coming.

934
00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:47,530
I guess I imagine they probably don't know.

935
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:48,910
They're coming before them.

936
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:49,230
Yeah.

937
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:52,970

00:57:18,030 --> 00:57:19,670
It's a server slam run in February 26th.

958

00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,250

00:57:23,930 --> 00:57:25,150
It might be an hour plus.

962
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:26,230
It might be an hour plus.

963
00:57:26,490 --> 00:57:26,590
No!

964
00:57:27,970 --> 00:57:32,930
They're talking about the PlayStation Plus catalog network
thing.

965
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:35,510
In collaboration with Marvel Games, be greater together.

966
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:36,750
It's not like this.

967
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:41,550
Double my cry.

968
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:45,510
The Spider-Man must balance their personal and heroic
responsibilities.

969
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:47,050
Are you crying right now?

970
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:48,410
You want more and more again?

971
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:51,790
No, there might be one last.

972
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:52,410
No!

973
00:57:52,890 --> 00:57:53,910

Oh, wait.

981
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:35,830
This version also offers gyro-stopping gaming using
DualShock 4 or PS5 DualSense controller simulating the

982
00:58:35,830 --> 00:58:37,650
original light gun experience.

983
00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:40,430
Is that pecking?

984
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:43,010
It's Time Crisis.

985
00:58:43,110 --> 00:58:44,590
Oh, there's Time Crisis, too.

986
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:47,090

00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:48,090
Oh, my God.

988
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:51,670
Big Walk is a cooperative multiplayer adventure about
teamwork and talking.

989
00:58:51,830 --> 00:58:52,330

993
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:25,250

and creative director Greg Gregory Loudon has even more

994
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:26,850
systems and combat to break down.

995
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:28,590
Let's take a look.

996
00:59:28,630 --> 00:59:29,590
Oh, oh, oh.

997
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:31,650
Big walk.

998
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:37,310
Okay, we have one last game that we want to tell you about.

999
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:38,910
One last trailer.

1000
00:59:39,330 --> 00:59:39,990
Wait, wait, wait.

1001
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:41,390
We actually do have one last trailer.

1002
00:59:41,890 --> 00:59:43,310
Min, we do have one last trailer.

1003
00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:45,470
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1004
00:59:46,210 --> 00:59:46,830
What is it?

1005
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:47,310
What is it?

1006
00:59:47,950 --> 00:59:49,310
I know you better than that.

1007
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:50,950
Oh, never mind.

1008
00:59:51,430 --> 00:59:52,410
I, I lied.

1009
00:59:52,430 --> 00:59:52,950
Hey, everyone.

1010
00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:53,910
I'm Gregory Loudon.

1011
00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:56,270
They're just explaining another game.

1012
00:59:57,010 --> 01:00:03,330
Today we're excited to show off our comeback stronger
features and Eclipse gameplay running on PlayStation 5.

1013
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:05,250
It was the Saros game.

1014
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:09,530
It's basically like Toho, but what if it's a shooter?

1015
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:13,030
Who is discovering the hostile shape-shifting planet of
Karko.

1016
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:18,910
I don't know if you ever played Returnal, but it's like a
spiritual successor of Returnal, and it's literally like

1017
01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:20,090
Toho if it's the shooter.

1018
01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:22,170
Oh, okay.

1019
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:23,510
That sounds terrifying.

1020
01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:25,170
It's pretty fun.

1021
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:26,050
I played Returnal.

1022
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:28,370
It's really, really fun, but it's also really hard.

1023
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:29,070
This looks fun, but...

1024
01:00:29,070 --> 01:00:30,010
You are not on your own.

1025
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:31,750
But it's not Double Me Cry 6.

1026
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:35,710
Interacting with the survivors of Echelon 4 will help you
understand the mysteries of Carcosa.

1027
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,460
They didn't all die.

1028
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,600
Some of them changed.

1029
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:50,900
This is Primary, the voice of Sultari.

1030
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:57,540
You can engage with our permanent progression systems to
upgrade your armor's attributes and acquire special perks.

1031
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:06,500
With Carcasson modifiers, you can adjust your experience by,
for example, making hostile So it's great because I can't

1032
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:09,380
hear anything, everyone just looks like they're talking in
slow motion.

1033
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:16,140
However, all adjustments you choose must be kept in balance
to ensure a consistent challenge level.

1034
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:21,780
Primary also allows you to teleport directly to any biome
that you have unlocked.

1035
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:23,520
This means getting back into the action quicker.

1036
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:28,440
It also means easier replayability the further you get into
the world.

1037
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:36,260
just end with the logo of devil may cry that's it restart
the selected biome and get back to where you were and now

1038
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:39,340
it's time to take another shot at what kills you the first
time around

1039
01:01:45,930 --> 01:01:57,250
eventually you come across an alien device yeah lord by
using it you discover that it calls the eclipse and then

1040
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:58,910
eclipse happens

1041
01:02:02,450 --> 01:02:15,870
intense eclipse the eclipse corrupts the world it's a
complete escalation of our gameplay our audio yeah hostiles

1042
01:02:15,870 --> 01:02:22,990
now shoot corrupted projectiles which produce your maximum
armor integrity but you can restore it by using your power

1043
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:31,670
weapon weapons and artifacts also become corrupted which
this is so much information about this game which ramps up

1044
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:38,390
yeah this game is like a little i remember returnal was a
little complicated too we can't wait for you to play saros

1045
01:02:38,390 --> 01:02:41,430
when we launch on april 30 2026.

1046
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:54,550
oh and that's where the toho starts i see it yeah yeah they
all all the attacks are literally toho

1047
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:05,220
I will say the outfits are very mediocre though.

1048
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:09,120
The DLC, not DLC, the exclusive outfits.

1049
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:11,580
What's this?

1050
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:12,360
A lot of gotten there.

1051
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:14,420
Oh my god, there's more trailers.

1052
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:16,320
There's actually more trailers left.

1053
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:18,240
It's not just one hour.

1054
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:19,660
Wait, wait, wait.

1055
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:21,020
Oh, wait!

1056
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:23,740
Oh, there is a new Marvel game.

1057
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:25,720
Oh, I think this is a fighting game.

1058
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:27,160
This is a fighting game?

1059
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:27,440
No.

1060
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:29,120
Oh, is this...

1061
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:30,600
Like the one that's like really used.

1062
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:39,140
yeah yeah yeah we still have to see it it's the fighting
game i hope it does better because like i don't know if you

1063
01:03:39,140 --> 01:03:48,380
heard about 2x ko from league you cannot stand against the
storm no but um riot games launch the fighting game um

1064
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:56,340
that's also similar to this one which is like a tag teamer
tag team and then uh they recently fired majority of their

1065
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:58,720
staff like a couple of days ago

1066
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:04,160
Oh It magic's in there now.

1067
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:05,500
I've got this one.

1068
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:15,540
Oh shit Wolverine X-Men get it done Oh my god, it really
does remind me of Marvel versus Capcom

1069
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:20,820
What's this magic?

1070
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:21,720
She's cute.

1071
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:23,560
Oh, she's in Marvel rivals.

1072
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:28,740
So you're gonna see a butterfly robot danger Who the fuck is
danger?

1073
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:32,800
Wait, Seed Blum?

1074
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:35,080
Oh, Wolverine's voice by Seed Blum!

1075
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:36,140
I didn't even notice.

1076
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,520
Surrender to avoid further danger.

1077
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:39,400
Oh.

1078
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:42,340
That suits him.

1079
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:42,900
Yeah.

1080
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,380
He was also starring the screen.

1081
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:48,460
Yeah, I was like, who's...

1082
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:49,140

1083
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:53,000
Yeah, Seed...

1084
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,020
Oh, Seed Blum was voiced Wolverine 20 years ago.

1085
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:57,220
I didn't even know this.

1086
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:58,080
I didn't realize that.

1087
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:03,740
Oh my god, Cosmo and Howard the Duck.

1088
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,210
He's also in it.

1089
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,240
What the hell?

1090
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:09,880
What is...

1091
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:10,400
What is...

1092
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:11,920
What is...

1093
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:13,920
What is this?

1094
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:17,580
What is the most I've ever known about Marvel.

1095
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,880
I bet you know all about Marvel now because of Marvel
rivals.

1096
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:24,620
I did, honestly.

1097
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:29,400
It's the most I've ever known about Marvel.

1098
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:34,720
Magic actually looks really...

1099
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:36,600
It looks very faithful.

1100
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:40,600
I'm going to look at Dord...

1101
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:43,200

She's doing the...

1104
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:57,740
She's trained the X-Men over years through battle
simulation.

1105
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:03,620
So as a zoner in this game, she's going to set up so much
many traps that our opponents are going to feel like they're

1106
01:06:03,620 --> 01:06:13,720
running i have no idea who danger is guys is she like a

01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,240
What is this?

1123
01:07:05,620 --> 01:07:06,140
God of War?

1124
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:09,940

The new God of War.

01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:03,220
New Metal Gear Solid Collection.

1170
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:05,300
John Wick.

1172
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:08,340
John Wick is cool.

1173
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:10,300
John Wick was pretty cool.

1174
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:13,680
I was like, you had Metal Gear and God of War.

1175
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:14,760
Are you not happy?

1176
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:16,220
I'm not happy.

1177
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,560
We didn't have Double May Cry 6.

1178
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:20,680
I'm greedy.

1179
01:12:22,660 --> 01:12:26,860
I was promised a Double May Cry 6, but I'll take the Metal
Gear.

1180
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:29,340
You know, you're right.

1181
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:29,840
You're right.

1182
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:31,180
You...

1183
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:33,700
We did have Metal Gear, though.

1184
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:38,460
I said it as a joke and then it happened.

1185
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:42,220
No, I knew it was going to happen.

1186
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:42,720
Oh, yeah.

1187
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:43,680
I sniffed it out.

1188
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:44,780
Oh, the Steam sale.

1189
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:45,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1190
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:47,040
The Steam.

1191
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:49,480
Oh, I mean, Space Station 5 still has no game.

1192
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:56,780
I mean, you wait like, if we just wait like two to three
months, it'll just show up on Steam anyway, I feel.

1193
01:12:58,460 --> 01:12:58,900
Yeah.

1194
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:02,620
Nothing is ever truly PlayStation exclusive.

1195
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:04,640
We just wait long enough.

1196
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:07,100
Except for, yeah, even Kingdom Hearts.

1197
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:12,100
Are there any games that are like, well, I guess like all
the Pokemon games are like system exclusive.

1198
01:13:12,620 --> 01:13:16,000
Yeah, because they're, they can, because you can really only
run it on the Switch.

1199
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:19,300
I feel like it's like a lot of games that are like any
Nintendo.

1200
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:25,480
Yeah, because they're like made in mind with the, uh, with
the hardware, like the special hardware.

1201
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,460
Uh, hey, I still vouch for AstroBot.

1202
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:34,620
Oh yeah, AstroBot is still a PlayStation.

1203
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:42,720
exclusive well oh and bloodborne yeah i mean it has to be
well not bloodborne but like astrobot because of like it's

1204
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:53,720
paying tribute to all the sony games yeah yeah yeah uh i
mean it was a pretty good state of play i felt like you know

1205
01:13:53,720 --> 01:14:01,660
it it gave us a lot of content yeah yeah it actually did
announce a lot of new games for it to look forward to saw a

1206
01:14:01,660 --> 01:14:08,940
lot of them are like coming up this year as well yeah i
didn't feel like any game really overstated to welcome yeah

1207
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:16,220
like it's kind of they explained stuff and then went on to
the next thing yeah yeah i thought i'm glad that it didn't

1208
01:14:16,220 --> 01:14:24,300
end on marathon especially following up with john wick i
wish john wick was i mean like i mean god of war remaster

1209
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:29,940
was a pretty good announcement but i think like john wick at
the end would have been pretty hyped too because like it was

1210
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:33,700
such Keanu Reeves at the end.

1211
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:38,140
Alan Wick would have been better.

1212
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:44,660
Yeah, like, you know, it's not like, I felt like, I think, I
remember last state of play was pretty mediocre, but this

1213
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:45,460
one was all right.

1214
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:47,620
I don't remember what.

1215
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:48,200
I liked it.

1216
01:14:48,260 --> 01:14:51,460
Yeah, I didn't even remember what last state of play had for
announcements.

1217
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:55,720
I just remembered it was very, I just remember saying that,
oh, it felt really mediocre.

1218
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:58,480
Like, didn't really have a lot of like really fun
announcements.

1219
01:14:58,540 --> 01:14:59,120
But this one did.

1220
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:10,340
this one had a lot of fun announcements to look forward to
yeah i thought it was good uh yeah it was yeah i loved how

1221
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:21,960
like the moment it went to metal gear your whole thing
crashed out what the hell this was a targeted attack to me

1222
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:30,780
the perfect timing thought we might get something kingdom
hearts for You know it was like a copium.

1223
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:32,660
Yeah, that was a copium.

1224
01:15:33,260 --> 01:15:39,940
Kingdom Hearts I feel like we gotta wait like five more
years until he's here anything about kingdom hearts 4.

1225
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:41,580
Honestly.

1226
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:42,480
I don't know.

1227
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,060
I feel like for kingdom hearts.

1228
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,480
I feel like for kingdom hearts.

1229
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,720
Wait, when did kingdom hearts 3 come out?

1230
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:50,060
I'm gonna look that up.

1231
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:51,300
Kingdom hearts.

1232
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:51,900
I don't know.

1233
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:53,700
It's been a long time now.

1234
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:58,340
I think I think most people aren't going to be alive.

1235
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,780
when Kingdom Hearts finishes.

1236
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,320
That's so sad.

1237
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:04,620
That's so sad.

1238
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:06,520
Kingdom Hearts 3 was 2019.

1239
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:09,540
Yeah, but Kingdom Hearts 2 was 2005.

1240
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:10,900
What the fuck?

1241
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,320
Okay, Kingdom Hearts 1 was 2002.

1242
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:16,020
Kingdom Hearts 2 was 2005.

1243
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:18,260
And then 3 was 2019.

1244
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:20,860
What the fuck happened?

1245
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:26,680
Yeah, I think we're going to wait like five to six more
years, guys, for Kingdom Hearts 4.

1246
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:29,100
Yeah.

1247
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:30,060
Yeah, probably.

1248
01:16:30,780 --> 01:16:31,520
I think they...

1249
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:32,420
Well...

1250
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:35,020
Maybe they're just waiting for Disney to make more IPs.

1251
01:16:35,180 --> 01:16:36,060
They ran out of Worlds.

1252
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:40,440
They ran out of Disney IPs to make Disney Worlds.

1253
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:41,900
They still have so many.

1254
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:43,080
That's not even.

1255
01:16:45,140 --> 01:16:46,380
We're going to have...

1256
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:47,540
We're going to have...

1257
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:49,560
They could bring back Dinosaur.

1258
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:52,780
Okay, now that's dope.

1259
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:55,380
Now that's dope, man.

1260
01:16:55,580 --> 01:16:56,800
I don't think a lot...

1261
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:57,460
I don't think...

1262
01:16:57,460 --> 01:16:58,160
I feel like...

1263
01:16:58,160 --> 01:16:59,100
Wait, how much did Dinosaur...

1264
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:01,120
as we're making a box office.

1265
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,840
probably like zero dollars.

1266
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:06,600
I don't know.

1267
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:09,160
It doesn't matter.

1268
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:09,880
It doesn't matter.

1269
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:11,220
They still have more IP.

1270
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,020
They still have more IP.

1271
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:15,400
Oh, you're right.

1272
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:17,780
They never had Emperor's New Group.

1273
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:20,740
Emperor's New Group was never, uh, never.

1274
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:21,520
Yeah.

1275
01:17:22,690 --> 01:17:23,040
Juana.

1276
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:25,200
There's like Enconto.

1277
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:35,740
Wait, technically now Disney owns the simpsons now so this
simpsons can be canon can you imagine if you have simpsons

1278
01:17:35,740 --> 01:17:45,060
in the kingdom hearts universe it's like so has been your
home when we're simpsons hanging out with sora from kingdom

1279
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:56,440
hearts oh yeah you have to have like sora again where you
like write on the the billboard like I won't rank Donald

1280
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:57,620
Duck or something.

1281
01:17:58,380 --> 01:18:02,740
And then Mr. Burns is like the heartless villains or
whatever.

1282
01:18:03,260 --> 01:18:04,860
Yeah, Mr. Burns has the heartless.

1283
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:07,060
He's working with Organization 13.

1284
01:18:11,580 --> 01:18:13,260
And then it works too well.

1285
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:13,980
It works too.

1286
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:14,420
Oh my God.

1287
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:15,860
And they're family guy.

1288
01:18:16,220 --> 01:18:19,840
They can actually have Simpsons and family guy in Kingdom
Arts.

1289
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:22,560
Oh my gosh.

1290
01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:27,260
There's another minigame where you sing the opening with and
there's like memes today.

1291
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:34,280
And all you see is violence and movies and sex on TV.

1292
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:43,160
It's their own little, like the Little Mermaid, the Little
Mermaid's rhythm game, but with Family Guy.

1293
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:45,700
Oh, it's terrible.

1294
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:48,200
No, it just reminds me of that time I met Sandhorn.

1295
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:56,100
March, I have to go seal the door to practice

01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:45,320
She had no volume for her state of play.

1356
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:50,280
It was communicating via Morse code at times.

1357
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:52,700
But it was really fun.

1358
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:56,240
It was fun baiting her being like, oh my god, Bloodborne.

1359
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:57,840
Oh my god, Metal Gear.

1360
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:02,280
And it ended up actually being Metal Gear.

1361
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:06,260
All right, I need to know what this observation game.

1362
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:10,160
So, oh, I don't know.

1363
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:17,520
i've never heard of these games that they've made no code
they made observation and stories untold i mean stories

1364
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:23,940
untold had pretty good reviews i've heard about this game
before i never played it myself and their internet dies on

1365
01:26:23,940 --> 01:26:26,880
metal gear like everything happened

1366
01:26:30,460 --> 01:26:41,060
but it was a very fun it was a very fun watch a lot with
with men um uh i had a great time um um both games are

1367
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:49,560
pretty good do you think they'll do do you guys think that
they'll do um uh silent hill justice though i was surprised

1368
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:56,600
that they didn't get uh they didn't get the the same dev
team that made silent hill too i really like the remastered

1369
01:26:56,600 --> 01:27:04,700
i personally really like the silent hill um two remasters so
i was surprised they didn't get them yeah i was gonna say i

1370
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:15,380
was looking through the trailer it doesn't really have like
like the similar gameplay um um uh the similar gameplay as

1371
01:27:15,380 --> 01:27:22,400
uh silent like the the no code dev team that hasn't made a
game that's similar in gameplay to what silent hill is so um

1372
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:28,620
i'm i'm very curious on how that's gonna be like uh not so
deadpoint thank you for the five gifted subs thank you thank

1373
01:27:28,620 --> 01:27:34,240
you one wing and banana thank you for the twitch prime thank
you thank you oh yeah they're too bit you're right they

1374
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:42,260
already have their hands full with silent hill one remake i
don't think i'll be playing too was so fucking scary for me

1375
01:27:42,260 --> 01:27:53,840
actually um took i was so scared my like i would i could not
do more than two hours of that game every stream um what

1376
01:27:53,840 --> 01:28:01,000
else i think i'm obviously the one i'm looking forward to is
the god of war uh remaster it's remastered right it's not a

1377
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:07,020
remake right it's not just a remastered because it's like in
development i feel like if it's in development i don't think

1378
01:28:07,020 --> 01:28:12,680
we're gonna see the game until i don't think we're gonna see
the full remastered yeah it's a full remake i mean they have

1379
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:21,860
to it's it's the game is like incredibly old so like they'll
have to remake it from scratch um and i'm glad that they got

1380
01:28:21,860 --> 01:28:28,040
the original voice actor too for him um yeah but i'm
definitely looking forward to john wick the original re the

1381
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:35,580
god of war remake trilogy uh because i've never played the
original trilogy before as well um and like you know the

1382
01:28:35,580 --> 01:28:41,700
only way to actually play is like get on the playstation 3

1383
01:28:41,700 --> 01:28:53,800

1387
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:28,740
definitely be streaming resident evil the fact that resident

1390
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:47,800
Dead or alive.

1391
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:51,580
I'm so sad that dead of alive.

1392
01:29:52,060 --> 01:29:53,680
Dead or alive isn't...

1393
01:29:55,960 --> 01:30:01,020
I'm so sad dead or alive isn't the beach game.

1394
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:05,580
The beach games aren't available on Steam for...

1395
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:16,660
because it's like restricted restricted to Asia even the
English versions too I looked it up I've always wanted to

game series

1398
01:30:35,780 --> 01:30:43,420
yeah you can't get it in America I think you have you have
to have like a Asian account to get the versions like

1399
01:30:43,420 --> 01:30:50,020
because there is a there is like an english version for the
beach the beach game episodes the beach episodes but like

1407
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:17,980
I made one tiny little oopsie.

1408
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:24,220
Just a tiny little oopsie guys.

1409
01:32:25,180 --> 01:32:27,800
Or I can move you guys down here.

1410
01:32:29,260 --> 01:32:32,260
Just a little oopsie doopsie.

1411
01:32:36,980 --> 01:32:37,240
Oops.

1412
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:41,320
Don't worry.

1413
01:32:41,780 --> 01:32:43,300
I will have time.

1414
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:47,460
Surely this month to actually do it a sponsor, I believe.

1415
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:51,180
Don't worry, I'm very professional.

1416
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:53,440
There's no way I forget about it.

1417
01:32:53,540 --> 01:32:57,120
I have, like, literally two more weeks, guys, for me to do
that sponsor.

1418
01:32:58,420 --> 01:32:58,860
Surely.

1419
01:33:00,460 --> 01:33:02,040
Two more weeks, guys.

1420
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:11,100
But, but yeah, I had a, um, because, like, I literally don't
even remember what last day to play even gave us.

1421
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:12,120
Oh, Wolverine!

1422
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:13,060
That was it.

1423
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:14,860
I remember now.

1424
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:20,860
the last because like the last day of play was so last
minute because like remember like they were like they

1425
01:33:20,860 --> 01:33:27,860
announced a day before like it was supposed to broadcast and
everyone was so confused they were like what the fuck like

1426
01:33:27,860 --> 01:33:36,960
like that's like such an awkward time for a stay to play and
then and then like and then literally the only thing that

1427
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:46,140
was good about it was the wolverine game and then they're
like we need filler games right now some trailers, so make

1428
01:33:46,140 --> 01:33:47,880
it look like it's not for Wolverine.

1429
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:48,620
Yeah.

1430
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:51,420
Yeah, that's why I remember now.

1431
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:54,400
It was literally just for Wolverine, and that was it.

1432
01:33:55,340 --> 01:34:00,100
And then they threw in some filler trailers to make it seem
like it wasn't just for Wolverine.

1433
01:34:02,340 --> 01:34:04,760
Because there was literally nothing else to announce.

1434
01:34:11,170 --> 01:34:11,370
Yeah.

1435
01:34:11,630 --> 01:34:13,970
Well, my original plan.

1436
01:34:15,470 --> 01:34:26,030
Originally, my plan was to do two sponsors today but they
all start at 9 p.m so I guess I'll see you guys tonight at 7

1437
01:34:26,030 --> 01:34:40,650
p.m I'll see you guys at 7 p.m on the YouTube channel chat
um where we're gonna be doing part five of God of War I

1438
01:34:40,650 --> 01:34:49,210
don't know how much progress we're gonna make just a tiny
bit of miscalculation um I don't know because would

1439
01:34:49,210 --> 01:34:55,290
originally, if I didn't have another stream tonight, I would
have done a longer stream do more, play something else on

1440
01:34:55,290 --> 01:34:59,670
Twitch, but because 7 p.m.

1441
01:34:59,790 --> 01:35:00,230
PST.

1442
01:35:00,750 --> 01:35:02,250
I always work at PST time.

1443
01:35:03,190 --> 01:35:04,290
West Coast, Besh Coast.

1444
01:35:06,150 --> 01:35:11,850
But like I don't want to use up all my energy for tonight
because we really have to make progress on God of War.

1445
01:35:12,190 --> 01:35:19,530
I don't want, we are not repeating the God of War in this
incident where it took me more than the, I don't I think,

1446
01:35:19,730 --> 01:35:22,130
like, it took me eight months to complete God of War.

1447
01:35:22,510 --> 01:35:29,830
Like, yeah, it took me eight months to even beat the first
God of War game.

1448
01:35:30,130 --> 01:35:32,790
So, we gotta, we gotta step on it, guys.

1449
01:35:33,090 --> 01:35:34,870
Like, we're already at one month.

1450
01:35:34,970 --> 01:35:36,070
Wait, not even one month.

1451
01:35:36,290 --> 01:35:41,250
We started, I think we started God of War 2 almost two
months ago, guys.

1452
01:35:41,550 --> 01:35:43,770
We started it in December, chat.

1453
01:35:44,070 --> 01:35:46,710
So, we gotta, guys, we're losing time here.

1454
01:35:49,030 --> 01:35:59,170
of war game um because we're only at 50 we're only done uh
we're only at the 50 mark so i want to keep my energy to

01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:09,670

latin december so it's already mid february so progress is
