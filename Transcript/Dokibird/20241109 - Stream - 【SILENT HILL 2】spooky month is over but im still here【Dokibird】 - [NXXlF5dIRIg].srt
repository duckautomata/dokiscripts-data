1
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,300
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,740
I'm here now.

3
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,900
I'm back from Twitch.

4
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,000
Sorry, I had to make some tea.

5
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,120
I had to make some tea before I started the stream, because it's been a long week.

6
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:09,340
I had to cancel dance lessons today, which sucks, because I couldn't.

7
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:14,800
Yesterday, I had back-to-back dance lessons yesterday, and I was so sore.

8
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,080
And then today, I was just like, oh, fuck.

9
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,200
I can't.

10
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,820
I can't.

11
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,740
I can't dance.

12
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,320
I can't do more dancing right now.

13
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,820
I'm gonna fucking... I'm gonna explode.

14
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,160
But tomorrow, it's another long day.

15
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,060
It's just been a couple of long days lately.

16
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,500
But I'm trying not to overdo it too much.

17
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,760
But I know I do have the rest streams and stuff.

18
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,720
I didn't expect to play that long today, but it was really fun.

19
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,420
The rest stream has been incredibly fun.

20
00:02:52,880 --> 00:03:00,120
I know a lot of you guys wanted me to join the Blood Cult again, but I wanted to explore different things.

21
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:07,520
I really wanted to explore different things and interact with different people.

22
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:15,780
Because the last time, during the first Rust Kingdoms I was part of, I joined the Blood Cult.

23
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:21,400
And then, even though it was just one day, today, I joined the Viking Cult.

24
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:30,460
Because I heard that we're gonna get special powers on Day 3.

25
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,560
We're gonna get special powers on Day 3.

26
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,040
If we make it to Day 3, we get the Amish.

27
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,180
Or like you guys would call it, we join the fucking Amish.

28
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:47,360
So I'm sticking it out until I know what the special powers are.

29
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:54,320
I wanna know what the special powers are.

30
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,800
So for those who don't know, I have a Rust Drop.

31
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,520
So a very exclusive Rust Drop.

32
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:07,580
It's very limited to only a few streamers getting it during the entire event.

33
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:14,540
And for those who don't know, I am sharing an AK skin with Sykkuno.

34
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,140
I talked about it before on the Twitch stream.

35
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:21,000
I said a huge thank you to Sykkuno for inviting me.

36
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:28,160
Because each skin is paired up with another streamer.

37
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,640
And Sykkuno got chosen.

38
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,680
And then he picked me to share it with him.

39
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:38,120
So a huge shoutout to Sykkuno for letting me be a part of this too.

40
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,400
So for those who don't know, you just watch my stream on Twitch when I'm streaming Rust.

41
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:51,120
And when I'm streaming Rust, you just need to watch like an hour or two.

42
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,880
An hour, I think, of the Rust stream.

43
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,860
And then you'll be able to get your very own gun.

44
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:01,300
The reason why we picked the AK is apparently because this is the most used gun in Rust.

45
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,120
So that's why we were like, okay, we want an item that is frequently used by people.

46
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:13,000
And we decided to do an AK because apparently this is the meta Rust gun.

47
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,580
It's the meta gun.

48
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,820
And I was like, you know, because I'm known for Pew Pew.

49
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,220
And Sykkuno and I figured that it was the best match for us.

50
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:37,500
But yeah, so I know this is more customized because I know a lot of other streamers that got a drop, they are more generalized.

51
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,400
So people who are normally more... what is it called?

52
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,720
The item is more universal.

53
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:57,040
But since this is my first drop and also Sykkuno really wanted to have branding on it, we figured that it'd be nice to have something where we can have our branding on it since it's my first drop.

54
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,180
And I want my Dragoons to be proud of this.

55
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,360
Be like, yeah, I have a Doki Bird gun.

56
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,140
Yeah.

57
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,860
We're here to represent Doki Bird.

58
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:19,780
Maybe if we ever get another Rust drop, we'll make something more that the general public would want instead of just sticking our faces on it.

59
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,920
I don't know if we ever get a chance to do it again.

60
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:35,060
But like I said, I know a lot of people, a lot of the streamers that get the Rust drops, they tend to always get picked to be having Rust drops.

61
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,560
Because I don't know, this XQC is like fifth Rust drop.

62
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,660
I know XQC has a lot of them.

63
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,780
So I'm just thinking, you know, this is my first one.

64
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,080
I want my branding on it.

65
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,660
I don't know if I'll ever get it again.

66
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:56,300
I don't know if I'll ever get my own Rust skin again.

67
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,660
So I'm like, I want my face on it.

68
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,440
Because if I get it a second time, I won't put my face on it.

69
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,980
Anyway, so yeah, that's basically what I was doing on Twitch over there.

70
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,500
So the next time I stream Rust, I don't know if I'll stream it when I'm not in Canada.

71
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:25,620
Because you guys don't know, next week I'm going to be in America to practice for the concert with Mint.

72
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,640
So we'll see how it goes.

73
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,560
I'll bring my laptop and see if my laptop can run Rust.

74
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:37,380
So we can at least have like a guerrilla stream before the event ends.

75
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,720
And I'll see if I can guerrilla stream it on Sunday.

76
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,800
I'm not sure yet.

77
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,420
I might have the stream at night because I have a 3 hour dance class on Sunday.

78
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,760
So I'm not sure.

79
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,140
And I have a 2 hour dance class tomorrow.

80
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,140
My day tomorrow is like...

81
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,920
Block Wars, dance class, then members.

82
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,360
And then convention.

83
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:10,020
So it's Block Wars, members, convention.

84
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,700
Then Kamifuro.

85
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:23,860
Today it's Rust, Silent Hill, rehearsal for Kamifuro.

86
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,140
And then tomorrow it's like a 2 hour rehearsal.

87
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,960
I don't know, it was like soundcheck.

88
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:35,940
And then, oh my gosh, my week these days have been super packed.

89
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,700
But it's alright because next week I won't be streaming for a lot.

90
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,680
So I won't be streaming a lot.

91
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,940
So yeah, I'm like...

92
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:51,940
Yeah, it's a little stupid for me to pack my week like this.

93
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:56,200
But I won't be streaming much next week.

94
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,420
So I was just like, I'm not gonna be streaming a lot next week.

95
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:09,940
So I'm gonna stream a lot this week so you guys can get overdosed in Dokium until I come back.

96
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,380
It doesn't help that I'm still coughing though.

97
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,140
It really doesn't help.

98
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,920
But my voice isn't that bad, I hope.

99
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,840
I hope it's not that bad.

100
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,700
My voice is not that fucked up yet, I guess.

101
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:32,760
So I hope it's okay.

102
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,920
I'm still coughing though, which isn't very helpful.

103
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:45,580
Anyway, if you guys don't watch Twitch, another important announcement over at Twitch is that...

104
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:54,300
That I made on Twitch is that Doobie is our third special guest for the Phantom Thief concert.

105
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,800
You guys do not follow me on Twitter.

106
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,860
I'll post it on Twitter too because I know it's like a giant special guest.

107
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:09,500
So I said it before on stream, but it was a very last- Yeah, I'll say last minute addition.

108
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:21,580
So for those who don't know, Doobie will be our third special guest at the concert.

109
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,880
Which means we will be singing with Doobie.

110
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,200
So we have a special song we're preparing with Doobie.

111
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,200
A special song and dance we're preparing with her.

112
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,080
So look forward to it.

113
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,780
I'm really excited.

114
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,240
It was a surprise for me as well.

115
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,800
I almost leaked it on the Minecraft stream.

116
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:46,000
I actually almost leaked it during the Minecraft stream.

117
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,620
That was the guest I almost leaked out.

118
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:56,240
Because we found out it was going to be announced today and I almost leaked it.

119
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:04,480
But yes, we do have one more final guest to be announced.

120
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,920
But yeah, that is our third special guest.

121
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,340
I'm very excited to perform with Doobie.

122
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:18,800
Honestly, I never thought I'd actually perform with her.

123
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,440
So it's very exciting.

124
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,060
And I'm super, super, duper excited.

125
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,140
I know I said excited a lot.

126
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,320
I don't know.

127
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,020
It's very surreal to be performing with her.

128
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,560
I'm pretty sure she has a lot of experience.

129
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,460
Other announcements do I have?

130
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,420
If you guys don't know...

131
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,360
I need to save the graphic, I'm pretty sure.

132
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,640
So if you guys don't know...

133
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:55,620
The Hyatt PC cases and the stuff...

134
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:59,100
All the Hyatt stuff are shipping out today.

135
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,480
Not today, this week.

136
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,660
Like next week.

137
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,080
So those who already pre-ordered...

138
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,500
Sorry, there's a lot of announcements.

139
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:15,560
So if you've pre-ordered the PC case or any of this...

140
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,840
The keycaps and everything...

141
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,980
They're being shipped out now.

142
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,300
Some people have already received it and everything.

143
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,400
But you can still buy them now.

144
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,220
We have extra stock.

145
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,840
It really does help me out a lot, too.

146
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,140
It tells people that, oh my gosh, I want more Doki Bird items.

147
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,240
Please feel free to check it out if you ever want keycaps.

148
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,700
Official Doki Bird keycaps.

149
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,140
Official Doki Bird PC case and all of that.

150
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,000
Please check it out and support Hyatt and support me.

151
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:57,400
Hyatt has been an amazing company who has been supporting me since I came back.

152
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:02,680
It really does mean a lot if you guys purchase a couple of items over there.

153
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:08,700
Anyway, I think that is all the announcements I want to make.

154
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,640
Let me double check.

155
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,820
Data update.

156
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,360
Another data update.

157
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,700
I was walking dad two days ago.

158
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:31,420
While I was walking him, there was a little traffic jam at the walk I was doing.

159
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,800
This person in the car turned down his window.

160
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,180
I was so confused.

161
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,820
I was walking past the car.

162
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,900
Dad stopped and looked at the window.

163
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:50,700
Suddenly, all I heard from that window was a tiny poodle dog.

164
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:59,340
I assumed that the tiny poodle was barking in the car.

165
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,020
The driver was like, I'm done.

166
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:08,740
He turned down the window so the poodle could bark at Doki Amber Doge.

167
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,260
Obviously, he was mad.

168
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:17,120
He was like, who the fuck is this bitch thinking she can bark at me?

169
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:22,360
Him and her were having this standoff at each other.

170
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,920
Just barking at each other.

171
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,180
He was looking up, she was looking down.

172
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,260
They were just barking at each other.

173
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,500
I tried to pull it, but he wouldn't move.

174
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,660
He just stood on the grass looking at it.

175
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,640
He just stood next to the car looking at it.

176
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,220
Just fucking going wild.

177
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,880
I pulled him away, and she still kept barking.

178
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,580
She was just poking his head out.

179
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,340
Just looking at dad.

180
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,660
Just kept barking at us.

181
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,600
She only stopped when the car was moving.

182
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,940
I was like, oh my god, what the fuck is going on?

183
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:07,900
I was like, why did you turn down the window so your dog could bark at my dog?

184
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,720
What the fuck is wrong with you?

185
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,060
I'm just thinking like, what is wrong with you?

186
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:19,040
Why did you roll down your window just for your dog to bark at my dog?

187
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,900
That was so fucking weird.

188
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,860
But yeah, that's the dad update.

189
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,500
Also, I was gonna announce this tomorrow.

190
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,340
Wait, do I?

191
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,960
Oh yeah, I was gonna talk about this tomorrow.

192
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,960
Oh wait, no I can't.

193
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,760
There's no reason for me to talk about it tomorrow.

194
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,820
I was gonna retweet it out tomorrow, but you guys don't know.

195
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,800
I think they tweeted it out.

196
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,260
I don't know.

197
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,220
I was told by my staff to be like, oh yeah, you should retweet it.

198
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,940
And I was like, I have so many announcements today.

199
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,660
I swear, my Twitter is just announcement, announcement.

200
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,660
It was like non-stop announcements.

201
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,200
My Twitter is just announcements and retweets now.

202
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,220
Anyway, so...

203
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,740
Another announcement, I forgot.

204
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,340
You guys remember Ascendant?

205
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,100
My logo is in Ascendant now.

206
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:18,900
So if you guys are playing Ascendant, or if you're in the closed beta.

207
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,320
I don't know if it's out now.

208
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:29,080
If you're in the beta, invited beta test, my logo is in the game now.

209
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,180
You can wear Doki Bird cosmetics in the Ascendant.

210
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:43,360
I think I saw one of the devs posted a picture of it.

211
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,040
And you can put it on your pants or on your shirt.

212
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,940
My logo is in it now.

213
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,220
They asked me if I want to be in it, and I was like, fuck it.

214
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,600
I was just like, why would I say no?

215
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,060
I said yes to it, so it's in it now.

216
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,180
That's really it.

217
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,560
I'll tweet it tomorrow.

218
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:08,560
I think that was the point where I already tweeted like four fucking different announcements.

219
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,980
So I was just like, I'm going to leave that tomorrow.

220
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:17,080
I also have a Kamifuro ad.

221
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:23,120
I have a Kamifuro ad that's scheduled in like an hour and a half.

222
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,580
So I was just like, there's too many ads.

223
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:25,960
There's...

224
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,320
There's too many ads.

225
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,740
I need to space it out.

226
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:38,720
I need to space out these ads.

227
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,460
But yeah, that's really it.

228
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,160
Anyway, I think that's enough stalling now.

229
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,020
I think I've stalled enough, and I'm going to go back to hell.

230
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,240
Simpleminded, thank you for the superchat.

231
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,080
Thank you, thank you.

232
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,240
Here's some stalling money doki so you can go buy a office of wood.

233
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,320
Thank you for the superchat.

234
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,440
Thank you, thank you.

235
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,840
I don't know why, but like...

236
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,140
Okay, this is unrelated to the superchat.

237
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,100
But the fucking...

238
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,560
It's like a picture before ever.

239
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,220
It's like living rent-free in my head.

240
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,740
Because I'm like, why did I say that?

241
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,460
I just keep thinking.

242
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,900
I was just like, that's the fucking dumbest shit I could ever say.

243
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:22,960
It's just the fact that the guy cracked.

244
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,040
He actually...

245
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,200
Like he was so in character.

246
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,340
He was so in character for like so long.

247
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,300
And that's what made him crack.

248
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,900
It's just, I...

249
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,960
For those who don't know, I'll grab the clip again.

250
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,280
Like that clip literally is living rent-free in my head.

251
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,360
Because it's just...

252
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,200
I think the funniest shit is the fact that...

253
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,760
What I said there...

254
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,680
What I said there was what made him fucking crack out of roleplay.

255
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,360
And it just lives...

256
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,180
It's just rent-free in my head because of it.

257
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:04,420
Like not all the fucking dumb shit that happened.

258
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,380
No, this was...

259
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:10,760
What I said was what made him like break out of roleplay.

260
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,980
For those who don't remember it.

261
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,920
I said that one of the dumbest shit I ever...

262
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,260
And I like rewatched it and I was like...

263
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:31,420
This is actually one of the fucking most dumbest shit I ever said in my life.

264
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,540
I don't know.

265
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,040
I just said the first thing that comes into my mind.

266
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,200
And that was the first thing that came into my mind.

267
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,960
It's like a picture but forever.

268
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,440
I'm booting up Silent Hill.

269
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,780
His mind literally like stalled there from what I said.

270
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:02,420
So in other words, yes, it's basically a picture.

271
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,240
Getting my tea out of the way.

272
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,860
There's been a lot of announcements.

273
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,800
I told you guys.

274
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,540
Remember when I tweeted?

275
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:16,380
And I was like, you guys are not ready for all the announcements.

276
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:20,500
That's hitting like all the announcements hitting till the end of December.

277
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,640
I was like, you guys weren't ready.

278
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,420
Fucking it doesn't stop.

279
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,780
The ride doesn't stop.

280
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,300
It keeps going on and on.

281
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,720
It never stops.

282
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,180
We'll never stop.

283
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,880
That's fucking right.

284
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,840
It's gonna keep going on and on and on.

285
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,960
Or maybe until like I fall off.

286
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,520
I don't know.

287
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,320
It's one or the other.

288
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,940
It'll stop.

289
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,660
I'm gonna fall off.

290
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,460
I can feel it.

291
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,320
All right.

292
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,160
Let's get ready for hell.

293
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,980
Let's get ready for...

294
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,280
Let's get ready for hell.

295
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,760
I'm ready.

296
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:09,820
Okay.

297
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,180
Silent hill.

298
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,080
All right.

299
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,200
I'm ready.

300
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:17,860
All right.

301
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:18,980
Continue.

302
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,920
Okay, I'm ready.

303
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,600
Ready for the hills to be silent.

304
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,520
God, I wish.

305
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,220
If anything, it's like not even...

306
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:34,800
Oh my gosh.

307
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,200
Okay.

308
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,280
Oh, I remember now.

309
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,180
Hey guys, we could skip all of this.

310
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,880
Guys, you want to know the fastest speed run?

311
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,950
Wouldn't it be funny if I get it correct?

312
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,410
Wouldn't it be funny if I somehow...

313
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:59,690
Wouldn't it be funny if like I figured out the code?

314
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,150
Wouldn't that be so funny?

315
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,850
Huh, wouldn't that be so funny?

316
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:05,290
Okay.

317
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:06,790
No.

318
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:08,690
Fortunately not.

319
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,970
Fortunately, life is not that easy.

320
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,690
All right, let's see which...

321
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:18,810
All right, off we go.

322
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,330
Okay, here we go.

323
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:28,330
Oh yeah, by the way...

324
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:32,090
Remember when I said I was going to release free animated stickers?

325
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,790
For those who can't afford the line.

326
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:39,590
By the way, they're not going to be like...

327
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:40,770
What?

328
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:43,450
Here?

329
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,310
Not here?

330
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:47,290
Let me up.

331
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:48,970
Oh, there we go.

332
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:54,270
I said there's going to be free animated stickers for those who can't afford line.

333
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:55,930
They're not going to be the same as line.

334
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:59,670
They're not going to be the same as line, but like...

335
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,790
It's also not the same amount, but like...

336
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,150
The fuck is that me?

337
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:06,690
Oh no, that's the nurse.

338
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,390
I was going to be like, damn, I look hot.

339
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,650
Sorry.

340
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,150
Those were the nurses.

341
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,370
I forgot about them.

342
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,610
I forgot the evil-er nurses.

343
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,090
The hotter nurses.

344
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,910
The sexy nurse.

345
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:21,950
The goth nurses.

346
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,740
Is my flashlight not on?

347
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,240
Oh no, it is on.

348
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:29,640
It's like...

349
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,250
Sorry, for some reason, I thought this was like...

350
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,180
I thought that was the light bulb.

351
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,260
Oh fucking hell, I forgot.

352
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,760
From rest to this.

353
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,300
From rest to this.

354
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,040
Oh my god.

355
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,960
The little...

356
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,700
The jump in like fucking gameplay.

357
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,220
That I have to do.

358
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,320
Okay, I'm going to find a hat.

359
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,940
I found out, by the way.

360
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,020
Because I was like, okay, by the way.

361
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,340
I was like...

362
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:09,900
How much do I have left from Silent Hill?

363
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,260
Because I was like, you know, curious.

364
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,620
I was like, alright.

365
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,820
How much progress have I made since I started this game?

366
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,420
Because I was like, I wonder.

367
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:21,820
And...

368
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,640
So I was like looking at the...

369
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,140
I was looking at the...

370
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,200
You know, like no commentary thing.

371
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,340
Like the...

372
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,100
Silent Hill 2 no commentary.

373
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,720
Just to find out like at what stage am I on?

374
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,820
This is part 5, yeah?

375
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,880
I am at like...

376
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,400
In the no commentary run.

377
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:51,720
I am at the 5 hour mark in the no commentary run.

378
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,820
And that meant...

379
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,100
Yeah.

380
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,680
I played part 5.

381
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,580
But like in the no commentary run.

382
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,500
It's at the 5 hour mark.

383
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,320
5 out of how many?

384
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,780
Well, that I'm a little too embarrassed to say.

385
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,400
I'll just say I'm at the 5 hour mark.

386
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,900
And then you guys can fill in the dots there.

387
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,000
You guys can figure it out yourself.

388
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:26,140
How much progress I've actually made in this game.

389
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,880
It's a little silly.

390
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,660
Sorry, I thought the nurse was here.

391
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,720
Nurse not here?

392
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,820
I hate how dark this place is.

393
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,340
Like I don't understand why Silent Hill could be a little...

394
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,320
Like cause it's like...

395
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:43,920
It's silent.

396
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,500
I know it's supposed to be silent.

397
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:46,900
But like...

398
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,600
Can it be like a little bit brighter?

399
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,280
Like I don't understand.

400
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,720
Why does Silent Hill have to be dark as well?

401
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,840
You're already silent.

402
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,700
You don't need to be dark.

403
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,320
It's not Dark Hill.

404
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,160
It's Silent Hill.

405
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,440
Doesn't make no sense.

406
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,400
Doesn't make any sense at all.

407
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,660
Don't understand.

408
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,060
That's not how it works.

409
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,080
Didn't fucking...

410
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,140
Yes it is!

411
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,160
Because they didn't name it Dark Hill!

412
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,020
It should have been Silent and Dark.

413
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,260
Why not Silent and Dark?

414
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,400
Yeah, I saw that.

415
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,940
There's like handprints there.

416
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:34,510
Silent and Dark Hill.

417
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:34,870
Yeah!

418
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:35,530
Yeah!

419
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:37,510
I don't like that.

420
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:38,370
It's...

421
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:39,590
Silent...

422
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,150
Like...

423
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,250
Silent and Dark Hill would have been a great name.

424
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:47,610
Yeah, Silent, Dark, and Scary Hill.

425
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,470
The Silent, Dark...

426
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,150
Just put all the things...

427
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,710
Put all the adjectives in there.

428
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:56,430
Might as well.

429
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:00,150
Silent, Dark, and Scary Hill.

430
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:03,910
Never!

431
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,710
I'll never take the hat off.

432
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:07,290
It's aesthetic at this point.

433
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,430
Smash.

434
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:10,750
Smash.

435
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:13,790
Smash.

436
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,310
Alright, what's in here?

437
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:18,970
Oh.

438
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:21,190
Watch it go dark?

439
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,000
One year they've been watching me.

440
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,380
So many pills they fed me.

441
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,160
When a loud hour comes.

442
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,020
I tremble every time the light falls.

443
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,000
What's that mean?

444
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,300
17, 18, 19?

445
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,440
Oh, wait.

446
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,840
One year they've been watching me.

447
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,020
So many pills they fed me.

448
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,620
When a loud hour comes.

449
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,560
I tremble every time the light falls.

450
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,240
There's the code at the top.

451
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,160
It's like one...

452
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,340
When a loud hour comes.

453
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,260
I tremble every time.

454
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,580
How many pills?

455
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,940
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

456
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,180
Okay, 1, 6.

457
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,340
1, 6.

458
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,800
And then we gotta find the clock hand.

459
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,700
1, 6 something.

460
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,840
There's no clock hand there.

461
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,120
What?

462
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,040
How am I supposed to see that?

463
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,100
There's no clock hand.

464
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,210
Watch it go dark.

465
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:47,510
1, 2.

466
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,190
1, 2.

467
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:51,690
2!

468
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:52,610
Okay.

469
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,250
1, 6, blank, 2.

470
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,350
Then what's the clock hand?

471
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,910
It's 1, 6, blank, 2.

472
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,670
There's no hand on there.

473
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,450
What does this mean?

474
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:09,970
What do the numbers mean?

475
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:11,830
Ah, yes.

476
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,350
Silent, dark, and scary hill.

477
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:16,150
My favorite not haunted town right up there.

478
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,990
Oh, yeah.

479
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,750
I forgot the actual town's name.

480
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:24,330
I forgot that's the actual...

481
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,070
Sorry.

482
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:28,110
That's like the actual town's name.

483
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:32,310
Masked Girl, Evil, Spooky Boy.

484
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,090
Thank you for the super chat.

485
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:34,510
Thank you.

486
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,070
Thank you.

487
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:36,670
Thank you for the super chat.

488
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:36,970
Thank you.

489
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:37,770
Thank you.

490
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:41,830
Okay.

491
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,930
1, 6, 2, something.

492
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,470
I guess I'll never know.

493
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:51,950
I guess I'll brute force it.

494
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,150
It's what I'm good at.

495
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,690
What ever happened to that nurse?

496
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,030
Hello, nurse.

497
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,790
Oh, I see that nurse is gonna come out.

498
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,350
Oh, 7!

499
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:05,310
Okay.

500
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,200
It was 7, guys.

501
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:14,400
1, 6, 7, 2.

502
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,860
I feel like that nurse is just gonna go ooga booga booga on me.

503
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,640
Like, cause she's like...

504
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,940
She looked...

505
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,460
She looked so scary.

506
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,340
Like, I don't know.

507
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,340
It's just...

508
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,880
She looked so scary.

509
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,340
I feel like sensory deprivation.

510
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,640
Thank you for the super chat.

511
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,860
Thank you.

512
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:47,800
Do I have to go back?

513
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,260
I'm just gonna brute force it.

514
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,400
I don't wanna go back.

515
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,580
I don't wanna go back anymore.

516
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:54,520
Like...

517
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,540
I already got...

518
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,860
I got like 50% of those numbers.

519
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,540
I got like, you know, more than 50% of those numbers.

520
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,500
Like, it's fine.

521
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:06,900
That's...

522
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,460
That's how we do it here.

523
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,300
Oh no, the nurse was here!

524
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:11,960
I don't remember.

525
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,700
I don't really wanna try and find the nurse.

526
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:14,520
Alright.

527
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,180
It was...

528
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,920
1, 6...

529
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,460
I mean, it was like 7, right?

530
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,460
7, 2?

531
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,440
Here we go.

532
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,460
1, 6, 2, 2.

533
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,140
Easy.

534
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:34,540
Yippee!

535
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,120
Speedrun!

536
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,480
I didn't wanna go back.

537
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,960
I didn't wanna go back.

538
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,240
Oh, the door's gone.

539
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:43,360
Oh.

540
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,320
Oh.

541
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,960
Oh, I don't like that.

542
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,580
I don't like how the door just disappeared.

543
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,420
That doesn't make me feel...

544
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,700
That doesn't make me feel good.

545
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,280
Like...

546
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,520
Like, it's a little...

547
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,160
It's a little bit too spooky.

548
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,200
Yeah.

549
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:06,400
Yeah.

550
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,380
This is the moment where we start speedrunning.

551
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,000
That's not a nice sound.

552
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,440
Hello?

553
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,260
Hello?

554
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,820
Oh, come on.

555
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,640
Come on, don't do this to me.

556
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,840
Oh, there she is.

557
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,680
There's the black nurse.

558
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,100
There she is.

559
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,280
Oh, nice.

560
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,040
There she is.

561
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,700
There she goes.

562
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,720
Oh god, she's so hot.

563
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,160
Wait, she's wearing white gloves.

564
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,640
She's like Mickey Mouse.

565
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:49,920
Okay, now she's...

566
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,940
Okay, I don't mean that as like in a hot way.

567
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,280
That's not what I mean.

568
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,420
I'm not attracted to Mickey Mouse.

569
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,800
I'm not, I swear.

570
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,080
Okay.

571
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,100
Did she come back to life?

572
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,320
These men in this game don't know where...

573
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,180
They know we're getting an off clap.

574
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,240
Remember, thank you for the super chat.

575
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,300
Maroma, sorry.

576
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,000
Thank you for the super chat.

577
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,060
Thank you.

578
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,140
That did not hit.

579
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,940
What the fuck?

580
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,180
Where did you come from?

581
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:40,150
Holy shit.

582
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,210
She can't...

583
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,290
She's just like, what's that noise?

584
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:48,830
I wasn't even aiming for you.

585
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:56,170
You weren't even in the original fight.

586
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,790
Like, wrong person.

587
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:03,230
I'm not mean to piss you off.

588
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,410
I heard like...

589
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:10,910
I have like a long way to go in this game.

590
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:14,090
Oh, you're like normal nurse, so you'll be fine.

591
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:17,450
You double swing?

592
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,450
I don't know when they double swing.

593
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:21,910
Oh shit!

594
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:24,110
When they do that thing, it scares me.

595
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:26,490
Oh my god.

596
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:29,570
When she grabs it...

597
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:32,150
Guys, when she grips it, I get a little scared.

598
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:37,310
The surprise grip.

599
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:40,570
What's this?

600
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:47,030
One factor is a silent hill in USA and it's not covered in fog.

601
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:48,090
Forgot why.

602
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:49,230
Underground gas...

603
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:49,450
What?

604
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:51,830
Wait, what?

605
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:57,650
Let me refresh so I can see what you wrote there.

606
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,170
Underground gases that caught on fire.

607
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,550
Not sure about the nurses though.

608
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:04,470
Thank you for the super chat.

609
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:04,750
Thank you.

610
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:05,410
Thank you.

611
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:08,130
This is why mascot staff have to be warned every time.

612
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:09,430
Don't keep visits.

613
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:10,670
Thank you for the super chat.

614
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:11,070
Thank you.

615
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:11,990
Thank you.

616
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:12,630
Rotisserie.

617
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:16,130
Oh, I thought this hole was a coal hole.

618
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,250
Where did the nurse go?

619
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:19,650
Oh, over there.

620
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:20,930
What the fuck?

621
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,290
I heard something.

622
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:24,730
Hello?

623
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,590
There's more.

624
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:30,190
Hello?

625
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:33,890
Wait, what?

626
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:36,710
Oh, here.

627
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:39,250
Here it is.

628
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,210
Get out!

629
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,050
Alright.

630
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:47,010
I know there's another monster in here.

631
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:47,610
Hello?

632
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:50,250
Hello, nurse?

633
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:52,910
Oh, there she is.

634
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:55,590
Woah!

635
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:08,470
Oh my god, there's some vomit.

636
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,190
There's some vomit.

637
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,010
Oh, no!

638
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:13,610
Okay.

639
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,230
That's not fair.

640
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:16,430
That's not fair.

641
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,220
Wasn't ready for the fucking vomit man.

642
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,240
It's not my thing.

643
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,080
Oh my god, maybe it is his thing.

644
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,200
Maybe it is his thing.

645
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,960
Why do they always vomit on me?

646
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:35,420
Okay.

647
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,420
Okay.

648
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,020
More meds.

649
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,320
Oh no, wrong hole.

650
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,060
Wrong hole.

651
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,200
Okay, over here.

652
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,420
Is there anything I'm missing?

653
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:51,700
Okay.

654
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,800
We gotta go here.

655
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,730
Gotta push this.

656
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:03,810
No, James is a fucking freak.

657
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:10,370
Ever since he lost Mary, it's not been the same for this man.

658
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:22,270
I swear, I must be the only VTuber that will have a fucking 20 part series of Silent Hill 2.

659
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:33,530
Everybody that started at the same time as me has already finished Silent Hill 2 and I'm still here.

660
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:34,610
Come on.

661
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,810
What the fuck?

662
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:41,010
How many?

663
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:41,870
How many?

664
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,130
How many bullets?

665
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:44,990
Oh, I give up.

666
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:47,730
Alright.

667
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:48,710
Wow!

668
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,530
Okay.

669
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:53,490
Now I'm angry.

670
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:55,610
You thought you could...

671
00:37:56,950 --> 00:38:01,810
Okay, as I was saying...

672
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:04,470
Oh my god, what a waste of bullets.

673
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:09,990
Oh, the double.

674
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,430
Oh, the triple.

675
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:13,910
What a waste of bullets.

676
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:14,970
What a waste.

677
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:16,310
I did it.

678
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:17,170
I did it.

679
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:17,790
A shot.

680
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:18,650
I swear.

681
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,130
I swear.

682
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:23,530
DJ, thank you for the very first super chat.

683
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:23,830
Thank you.

684
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:24,490
Thank you.

685
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:27,890
Hi Doki, this is my very first super chat and my birthday is on Monday.

686
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:31,790
I don't know if you're gonna be streaming on that day, but do you think you can give me a happy birthday?

687
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:34,110
I don't think I am streaming on that day.

688
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:37,950
But I'll give you a happy birthday, early birthday though.

689
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:39,430
Happy birthday to you.

690
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,030
Happy birthday to you.

691
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,670
Happy birthday dear DJ.

692
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,230
Happy birthday to you.

693
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:44,510
Yeah!

694
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:49,670
Oh my god, that was like a third party after third party after...

695
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,710
Like, where did the other nurse come from?

696
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:55,050
Where did they all come from?

697
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:58,110
It just makes me think that...

698
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:00,490
James...

699
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:03,050
James is definitely having...

700
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:05,790
He's there again, looking, staring.

701
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:07,430
He says he'll drag me there.

702
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,290
I don't want to.

703
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:09,130
Was he...

704
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:09,930
I don't want to.

705
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:10,990
I won't let him take...

706
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:14,590
Was he like, thinking about the nurses while his fucking dying wife is in the hospital?

707
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:16,810
James, the fuck?

708
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:27,930
I don't...

709
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,370
I don't like that.

710
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:33,470
I don't...

711
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,130
I don't like that.

712
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,390
That makes me feel a little uncomfortable.

713
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,530
No one knows.

714
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:48,290
Knows what?

715
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,350
Knows what, James?

716
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:53,750
What do you mean by no one?

717
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:54,290
What did...

718
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:56,970
James...

719
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:58,850
James...

720
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:00,870
Is this...

721
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,090
Are these painkillers?

722
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,490
James, do you have a little problem?

723
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:08,790
James...

724
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:11,530
Wait, where was the director's office?

725
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,530
Oh, it's over here.

726
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:21,130
James has a little problem with painkillers.

727
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:26,570
I'm just scared they're gonna come back and go ooga booga booga.

728
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:32,490
You guys always have to double tap.

729
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:34,010
Oh my god.

730
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:41,110
What's after the hospital, guys?

731
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:50,790
Okay, nice talk.

732
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,270
Great talk.

733
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:53,530
Oh my god, the climb up.

734
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:56,070
There'll be no pain anymore.

735
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:57,250
Oh.

736
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:58,430
Ah.

737
00:40:58,750 --> 00:40:59,290
The shining.

738
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,490
Ah.

739
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:03,170
I don't think it's working.

740
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:08,790
I definitely don't think that was working.

741
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:10,670
I do not think...

742
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:14,390
Do not think the painkillers were working.

743
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:18,630
Okay, nice.

744
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,010
Alright.

745
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:23,230
Okay.

746
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:26,990
Snooks, thank you for the superchat.

747
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:28,030
Thank you, thank you.

748
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:32,110
I can't believe the Silent Hill enemies are all Dodge tanks.

749
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:33,350
Thank you for the superchat.

750
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,630
Thank you, thank you.

751
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:37,130
Oh.

752
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:39,250
Alright.

753
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:40,910
Here I am.

754
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:43,390
Oh, alright.

755
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:44,490
Here I am.

756
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:46,690
Alright.

757
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:48,110
Oh.

758
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:49,910
Loser's ammo.

759
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:51,590
Oh.

760
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:58,950
Pressing the button won't be ba- Oh, I need to find the button.

761
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,220
Alright, here I go.

762
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,520
Ah.

763
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,120
Hmm.

764
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,360
Hmm.

765
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:15,400
Hmm.

766
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,860
Ah, look at all these holes.

767
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,200
Ah.

768
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,220
Hmm?

769
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:26,380
Hmm.

770
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,100
Hmm.

771
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,560
Nice padded room.

772
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,020
Hmm.

773
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,540
Oh, that sounds like a fucking problem.

774
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,240
Wait, can we crawl over here?

775
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,060
Oh my god, look at her go.

776
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:48,700
There we go.

777
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:50,340
Whoa, whoa.

778
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:51,960
I mean, good effort.

779
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,920
Whoa, wha- WHOA!

780
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,800
WHOA!

781
00:42:58,190 --> 00:42:58,950
Very good effort.

782
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:00,710
Very good- WHOA!

783
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,620
Oh my god, I panicked.

784
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,180
Oh my god, she has to be the strongest nurse I've ever encountered.

785
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:13,060
She-

786
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:21,240
She was the strongest nurse I've ever fucking bumped into in my life.

787
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,320
Holy shit.

788
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,360
Oh my god, what were you eating?

789
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:30,900
Bro, that nurse- All that nurse was working out.

790
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:34,520
I refuse to believe she was a normal nurse.

791
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:39,400
She was fucking working out.

792
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,640
She was definitely fit as fuck.

793
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,500
That thing over there?

794
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,900
What the fuck is that?

795
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,220
Where the- Where the fuck did he go?

796
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,520
Oh my god, she's back.

797
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,600
I don't know now.

798
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:01,320
I don't know about like- WHOA!

799
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,020
Oh my god.

800
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,060
I dodged him.

801
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,360
Wait, he came back?!

802
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,600
What the fuck?!

803
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,860
You came back?!

804
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:17,720
Oh my god.

805
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:27,850
I like how you fucking slithered out and slithered back in.

806
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:29,490
What is this

807
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:33,250
area?!

808
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:35,010
Oh my god, what is this area?

809
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,390
Why is this area so big?

810
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:44,090
I don't like this area.

811
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:47,910
I don't like it.

812
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:51,730
Doesn't give me any joy.

813
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:54,150
I know there's one more black nurse.

814
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:56,350
I literally saw her.

815
00:44:58,090 --> 00:44:58,690
Okay.

816
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:00,830
I'm not aiming today.

817
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:03,370
Today's not a good aim day, that's for sure.

818
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:04,590
I'm fucking missing.

819
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:07,310
I'm panicking so much now.

820
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:13,350
Panicking a lot this time.

821
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:16,990
Oh, she was the white nurse?

822
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:18,450
I thought she was the black nurse.

823
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,560
What's this?

824
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,000
I won't rest until they are solved.

825
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,260
I won't rest.

826
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:29,520
I can't rest.

827
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,200
I don't know how anymore.

828
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:32,780
Alright.

829
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:34,640
Forgot.

830
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,020
Today's not an aim day, guys.

831
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:39,260
Today's...

832
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:40,780
Today's not it.

833
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:41,860
It's not today.

834
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:48,060
9659.

835
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:49,760
Oh yeah, I was never gonna get that.

836
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,200
Yeah, guys.

837
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,940
I don't think I was ever gonna accidentally get that number.

838
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:57,300
9659.

839
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:57,620
Okay.

840
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,560
I was not pressing double numbers.

841
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:08,710
9659.

842
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:13,130
9659.

843
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:16,250
Get me out of here.

844
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:20,250
Get me out- 9659.

845
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:21,870
Good old shock therapy.

846
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:23,230
It works.

847
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:27,730
9659.

848
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:31,270
Okay.

849
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:36,430
Okay, why can't I get out?

850
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:48,650
What's in the box, James?

851
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:50,050
What's in the box?

852
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:51,830
What's...

853
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:52,190
Nothing!

854
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:54,470
Woo!

855
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:56,470
Yeah!

856
00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:00,090
Risked my life for nothing!

857
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:01,950
Hooking me up.

858
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:03,070
That's just like life.

859
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:05,830
I tried so hard and you get nothing out of it.

860
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:06,610
JK!

861
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:07,930
A door!

862
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:10,270
A dead person!

863
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:10,790
A dead person!

864
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:19,570
Just like life, you tried so hard and you get nothing out of it.

865
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:21,150
A free box.

866
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:28,290
What is that?

867
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:30,290
What is that?

868
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:31,150
Number one?

869
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:33,130
You're always number one.

870
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,680
Han Solo, is that him?

871
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,040
Negative one.

872
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,320
What was that for?

873
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:42,400
A door!

874
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:47,950
Oh!

875
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:49,430
She is an angel.

876
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:53,150
No one knows, only I can see the lady of the door.

877
00:47:53,810 --> 00:47:56,470
They cannot walk along her bridge, a thread.

878
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:58,850
They fall from the weight of their crimes.

879
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:03,750
Like bloated and ugly corpses, their skin she devours them.

880
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:05,730
Sin and sinners alike.

881
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:07,150
She saves me.

882
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:09,290
She is an angel.

883
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:10,330
Alright.

884
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:11,130
Nice.

885
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:12,890
Okay, let me go save.

886
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,770
Okay, I got an elevator key.

887
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:22,330
Guys, I need to know...

888
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:24,470
How long is this hospital?

889
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:33,010
How long is this hospital?

890
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:39,730
Okay.

891
00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:42,050
Long.

892
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:42,870
Okay.

893
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:44,710
Oh, hey, the radio.

894
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:49,730
Oh.

895
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:56,730
Oh, I don't think I like that.

896
00:48:58,920 --> 00:48:59,650
Wait, no.

897
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:02,150
Don't give me a good time, radio host.

898
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:08,580
Wait, that's me!

899
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:09,980
That's me!

900
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:10,560
Yeah!

901
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:25,980
What?

902
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:28,820
Tuberculosis?

903
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:33,520
OH!

904
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:34,220
THE PLAGUE!

905
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,260
I'm not supposed to answer this!

906
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,060
Oh my god.

907
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:53,680
We have to remember the questions?

908
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,790
I don't know, Silent Road?

909
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:17,910
Guys, what do you mean I'm supposed to pay attention to the fucking map?

910
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:27,090
Wait, I remember reading the newspaper for that!

911
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,880
Torn flesh, smashed bones, splattered blood.

912
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:41,120
Wait, pause.

913
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:43,800
Pause!

914
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,160
I have memos!

915
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:45,840
Pause!

916
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:49,220
Wait, pause!

917
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:51,780
I have... I have the memo!

918
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:58,320
Oh my god, I give up.

919
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:04,040
Pause, Mr. Radios.

920
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:14,680
I got the cliff notes.

921
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,220
Wait, Miriam sounds like a sister name.

922
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,580
Oh, but Heather's like my... the daughter's name.

923
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:27,390
All right, guys.

924
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:29,050
I need you guys to remember these questions.

925
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,860
This is your moment to shine, guys.

926
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,160
Back seaters.

927
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,280
This is it.

928
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,140
I unleash you onto my game.

929
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:41,440
But before we...

930
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:42,440
Wait.

931
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:44,600
All right, guys.

932
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:45,660
No, you can't forget them.

933
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:47,200
I'm allowed to forget them.

934
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:48,960
You guys, you guys...

935
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:53,380
You guys are supposed to help me out.

936
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:54,760
All right.

937
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,780
All right, before we get out of this hellhole.

938
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:58,840
I need to use the bathroom.

939
00:51:59,200 --> 00:51:59,780
All right, James.

940
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:03,500
I'm scared the elevator doors is gonna open and then like I die.

941
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,100
So I can't use the bathroom, guys.

942
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:09,630
I'm back.

943
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:11,770
That puzzle fucking sucks.

944
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:12,630
Okay, guys.

945
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:13,030
Guys.

946
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:14,230
Guys.

947
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:16,750
Guys, you want me to win, right?

948
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:18,730
You like winning, right?

949
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:23,150
That's why you follow me because I'm the... I'm the winning bird, right?

950
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:27,530
Guys, you like to see me win.

951
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:30,930
Don't you want me to win in a video game?

952
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:34,830
Why is it not opening?

953
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:37,830
Oh.

954
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:38,550
Oh, okay.

955
00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:40,130
I was still in the elevator.

956
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:43,410
That makes a lot of sense.

957
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:46,710
Oh my god.

958
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:51,670
All right, off we go.

959
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:53,450
Off we go.

960
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:57,160
Oh.

961
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,460
Oh, there he is.

962
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,720
Is that the only thing?

963
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:10,230
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

964
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:11,690
There we go.

965
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:14,910
Oh, fucking hell.

966
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:16,270
I hate these nurses.

967
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:18,010
They're not even like...

968
00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:20,450
I guess they are the hot ones.

969
00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:24,210
They... I mean, they're like the goth nurses and there's a nurse for everybody.

970
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:26,390
There's the vanilla white nurse.

971
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:27,290
There's the...

972
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:28,270
the...

973
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:29,730
the goth nurse.

974
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:31,670
There's the...

975
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:32,390
Oh, hey.

976
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:34,010
Supposed to go through here.

977
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:39,130
I feel like that's gonna hurt.

978
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:41,710
Hmm.

979
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:46,330
Oh, okay.

980
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:48,070
Huh.

981
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:50,130
Okay.

982
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:52,010
It doesn't hurt?

983
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:54,810
Huh.

984
00:54:57,530 --> 00:55:00,350
Why doesn't it hurt?

985
00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:02,930
Oh, I feel like...

986
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:08,950
Does that mean there's something where I have to...

987
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:15,510
Does this mean that I have to lead a monster here later?

988
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:21,880
Oh my god, I feel like... I feel... I feel like...

989
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:25,230
It's foreshadowing.

990
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,910
Why does it feel like foreshadowing?

991
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:35,310
Why does it feel like fucking foreshadowing?

992
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:46,620
I fucking knew it.

993
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,600
I fucking knew it, man.

994
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:55,460
I saw... I saw it a mile away.

995
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:57,360
I saw it.

996
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:05,780
I feel like I've gained like Silent Hill instinct where I'll be like, this is a good place for a monster.

997
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:12,220
It seems like a monster that's gonna jump out at me and try to be like ooga booga booga.

998
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:13,540
Ooga booga booga.

999
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:14,840
What?

1000
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:16,980
Where?

1001
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:19,080
Oh, there.

1002
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:29,420
All right, you can throw up in peace now.

1003
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:30,760
You are free.

1004
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:33,120
You are free now.

1005
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:33,920
Johnny, come on.

1006
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:34,740
Thank you for the super chat.

1007
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:35,100
Thank you.

1008
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:35,960
Thank you.

1009
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,440
Welcome back.

1010
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,260
No, no, please.

1011
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:41,500
Please give me it.

1012
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:42,100
Please.

1013
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:46,240
I don't want to be playing Silent Hill in 2026, guys.

1014
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:47,340
Please.

1015
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:50,600
Don't make me keep playing.

1016
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:58,060
Guys, all I'm saying, the longer we're in Silent Hill, the longer we don't play Dad of War.

1017
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,000
Is that what you want?

1018
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:00,980
That's right.

1019
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,100
That's right.

1020
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:05,140
I am holding Dad of War hostage.

1021
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,000
That's fucking...

1022
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:09,200
You wouldn't.

1023
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,000
No.

1024
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:23,480
I will hold him hostage if you don't listen to my demands.

1025
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:28,100
Oh, there he is.

1026
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:32,180
I really can't be bothered with these the black nurses here.

1027
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,440
They have knives.

1028
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:34,620
I feel like they're stronger.

1029
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,580
The goth nurses look like they're stronger.

1030
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,200
Hold strong.

1031
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:44,000
That's right.

1032
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:46,080
I know one of you will crack now.

1033
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:51,660
I know there are some God of War dragoons that are crying right now.

1034
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:52,680
That's right.

1035
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:54,380
I will hold them hostage.

1036
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:56,960
Two, three, one.

1037
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,460
Johnny, give me the super chat.

1038
00:57:59,580 --> 00:57:59,800
Thank you.

1039
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:00,600
Thank you.

1040
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:09,920
Where am I now?

1041
00:58:13,310 --> 00:58:14,710
Where am I now?

1042
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,140
Oh.

1043
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,040
You!

1044
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:26,940
All it takes is one dragoon.

1045
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:29,060
Oh, Maria.

1046
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:34,640
What?

1047
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,720
I've never been so scared in my whole life.

1048
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:50,660
No one told you to follow me.

1049
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:52,860
All you care about is that dead wife of yours.

1050
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:54,140
She's my wife.

1051
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,540
She's not dead.

1052
00:58:57,020 --> 00:58:59,800
No, I just... I literally just met... whoa.

1053
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:02,000
Don't leave me alone again.

1054
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:05,400
You're supposed to take care of me.

1055
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,240
Whoa, don't touch me.

1056
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:11,480
I'm fucking... I haven't had physical touch in a long time.

1057
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:13,240
Don't touch me.

1058
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:14,400
It's November still.

1059
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,460
Maria, no.

1060
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:18,660
It's still November.

1061
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:29,240
Hands off, wench.

1062
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:32,300
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1063
00:59:40,230 --> 00:59:42,550
I gotta calm down a little bit, Maria.

1064
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:46,210
Go on without me.

1065
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:47,030
I gotta calm down.

1066
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:52,850
Flaska, thank you for the super chat.

1067
00:59:52,910 --> 00:59:53,750
Thank you.

1068
00:59:55,690 --> 00:59:56,150
Oh,

1069
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:07,200
shit.

1070
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:08,240
Is she gonna follow me?

1071
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:10,600
Oh, fuck.

1072
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,020
Okay, can she die now?

1073
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,260
Oh, fuck.

1074
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:13,700
Okay.

1075
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,580
She can die now.

1076
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:16,040
Okay.

1077
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:17,560
That is bad.

1078
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,980
Oh, that is... that is very...

1079
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:23,660
Oh my God, why are you here?

1080
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,140
Oh my God.

1081
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:29,160
Alright, okay.

1082
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:31,880
I can't even tell her to like, hide.

1083
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:37,400
God damn it, I have to escort her?

1084
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:42,520
Not only is she make me fail my challenge, I have to escort her too?

1085
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:45,460
God damn it, Maria.

1086
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:48,160
Trying to win here.

1087
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:49,680
I'm trying to win in life.

1088
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:57,040
Oh, fuck.

1089
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:57,500
Okay.

1090
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:02,380
Okay.

1091
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:05,100
Now, I actually have to be extra careful.

1092
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:10,840
Alright.

1093
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:15,920
Oh, why can't you just carry a weapon?

1094
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,220
Okay, not this way.

1095
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:19,980
What are you doing here?

1096
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:20,940
Why are you going up ahead?

1097
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:21,860
Maria!

1098
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:23,620
Stand back!

1099
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,580
Wait, why is it raining?

1100
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,080
Are we inside?

1101
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:35,520
Oh my God, I think it's acid.

1102
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:42,480
Guys, this is not natural.

1103
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:45,180
It could be like, literally acid rain, right?

1104
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,640
Maria, this is not romantic.

1105
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:51,120
It could literally be acidic.

1106
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:53,400
Oh.

1107
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:56,320
Oh, we're back in the pool area.

1108
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:57,200
This is the...

1109
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:00,800
the pool area and the garden area here.

1110
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:15,840
Okay, I'm trying to make sure that she doesn't fuck me over.

1111
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:20,200
Is there anything here?

1112
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:20,860
No?

1113
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:26,460
Oh my God, it's just more stressful when you have to escort somebody.

1114
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:28,080
Oh no.

1115
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:30,800
Just so much more stressful.

1116
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:30,940
Oh.

1117
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:35,960
Hello?

1118
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:38,940
What?

1119
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:42,720
What?

1120
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:44,000
What?

1121
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:45,720
Everything looks the same.

1122
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:47,100
This?

1123
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:48,680
What is this?

1124
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:58,140
What do you think this is?

1125
01:02:58,220 --> 01:02:59,020
What is this?

1126
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:11,980
What?

1127
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:15,420
I'm like, if I can't open it...

1128
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:15,960
Like, why?

1129
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:20,620
Like, why don't we open this to... Maria, open this to John!

1130
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:21,840
James, sorry.

1131
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:24,680
You're so stupid that... Like, we open it together.

1132
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:26,300
I love you.

1133
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:30,760
Is that a dead body?

1134
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:38,580
Huh, what is in it?

1135
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:45,380
What is it?

1136
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:47,000
It's another ring.

1137
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:51,240
Here, why don't you take it?

1138
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:52,800
Oh my God, I have a collar on.

1139
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:53,900
Oh.

1140
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,040
I just realized.

1141
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:01,480
I just realized I have a collar on.

1142
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:03,160
That's right.

1143
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:06,900
Yep, I wore that in public.

1144
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:12,160
I think I told the story before, but I once saw a couple...

1145
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:16,280
Um, where the guy was like collar with leash.

1146
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:22,260
Walking in the public mall while the the girl was pulling on like holding on to the leash.

1147
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:28,240
I saw that in public and then the the the the guy had like a dog tail.

1148
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:29,980
And yeah.

1149
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:37,980
There were children there at the mall.

1150
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:39,560
Ha ha ha ha.

1151
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:40,600
Glad so.

1152
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:41,540
Thank you for the super chat.

1153
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:41,960
Thank you.

1154
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:42,600
Thank you.

1155
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:46,960
I gotta say it's funny how the dog mask is still being worn.

1156
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:48,860
I can't even think.

1157
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:50,340
Oh my God, it doesn't matter.

1158
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:53,880
I swear if I wasn't wearing the dog mask, I would be even more freaked out.

1159
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:59,880
Like, this dog mask is barely making me function right now.

1160
01:05:03,450 --> 01:05:05,650
The patients will become the diagnosis...

1161
01:05:06,930 --> 01:05:10,790
Scheduled for when they'll make recovery as my aim is always for the entire personnel.

1162
01:05:10,970 --> 01:05:14,250
Especially when their symptoms will become receding with effective treatment.

1163
01:05:15,550 --> 01:05:17,890
Why is there no fucking meds?

1164
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:19,010
Wait, where's Maria?

1165
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:20,530
Oh, there she is.

1166
01:05:20,570 --> 01:05:21,110
Oops, sorry.

1167
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:30,960
What do I do with it though?

1168
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:36,420
Day room...

1169
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:37,460
I don't even know that.

1170
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:39,680
Oh, I did not look at the map while I was exploring this.

1171
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:40,660
I don't know.

1172
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,100
Where am I?

1173
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:47,560
I was... I don't even...

1174
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:49,980
Where am I?

1175
01:05:58,070 --> 01:06:01,030
Like, I don't know where I'm supposed to go.

1176
01:06:01,230 --> 01:06:02,730
I actually don't know.

1177
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:07,250
Been here.

1178
01:06:09,450 --> 01:06:11,410
Where am I supposed to go?

1179
01:06:13,310 --> 01:06:15,590
Where have I not gone yet?

1180
01:06:17,410 --> 01:06:18,670
Oh, the pharmacy?

1181
01:06:25,950 --> 01:06:28,410
Oh, this was the one room I didn't go to.

1182
01:06:28,490 --> 01:06:30,090
Oh, that makes so much more sense.

1183
01:06:30,550 --> 01:06:35,490
I... literally the one room I did not go to in this entire...

1184
01:06:35,490 --> 01:06:37,870
Okay, I was like, what do I do with these two items?

1185
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:40,210
Why do I have the two rings?

1186
01:06:42,070 --> 01:06:42,930
Wait, what?

1187
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:51,720
All right, John.

1188
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,280
Where's your super chat, John?

1189
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:00,120
Okay, two, three, what?

1190
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:12,720
I was staring back!

1191
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:23,040
Ah, it's

1192
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:33,680
good!

1193
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,240
I didn't know it though!

1194
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:40,920
Guess we die.

1195
01:07:44,190 --> 01:07:45,890
Guess we'll never know.

1196
01:07:46,550 --> 01:07:48,650
Guess we'll never open this!

1197
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:57,810
Guess we'll never be able to open this ever again.

1198
01:07:59,670 --> 01:08:02,010
Okay, guys, but what was in it?

1199
01:08:02,510 --> 01:08:04,070
What was in it?

1200
01:08:04,270 --> 01:08:05,650
Guys, what was in it?

1201
01:08:05,770 --> 01:08:07,110
At least...

1202
01:08:07,110 --> 01:08:09,650
At least tell me what was in it!

1203
01:08:09,990 --> 01:08:11,710
At least tell me!

1204
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:21,540
I'm so sad.

1205
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,680
I'm so sad.

1206
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:26,880
I'm actually so sad.

1207
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:29,180
I'm so sad.

1208
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:30,520
Look what I did.

1209
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:31,980
Look what you did.

1210
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:32,920
Why?

1211
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:34,020
Why?

1212
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:36,460
Why?

1213
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:42,120
All right, where do we go now?

1214
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:47,280
I'm gonna go Pharoah.

1215
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:48,260
I'm gonna go Pharoah.

1216
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:52,740
I'm gonna fucking go Pharoah.

1217
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:59,340
I'm gonna go fucking Pharoah right now!

1218
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:02,660
Oh my god, guys!

1219
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:03,320
I'm gonna...

1220
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:10,030
All right, I'm not a save scummer.

1221
01:09:12,570 --> 01:09:14,490
I'm not a save scummer.

1222
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:18,510
Where do I go now?

1223
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:20,730
I'm not...

1224
01:09:20,730 --> 01:09:22,210
What do I...

1225
01:09:22,210 --> 01:09:23,210
I did everything!

1226
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:29,180
Where do I go now?

1227
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:33,960
Guys...

1228
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:35,160
We...

1229
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:38,080
We're doing the elevator.

1230
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,480
Wow, guys.

1231
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:48,700
That's so weird.

1232
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:50,340
My game crashed.

1233
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:56,330
That's so weird.

1234
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:08,240
That's so weird.

1235
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:09,320
Oh my god.

1236
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:10,680
Oh my god, my PC.

1237
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:13,220
That's so weird.

1238
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:15,000
That's so...

1239
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,060
Oh my god.

1240
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:17,740
My very first crash today.

1241
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:19,700
Wow.

1242
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:21,460
It was gonna happen.

1243
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:24,580
I can't believe it.

1244
01:10:24,580 --> 01:10:26,440
My game crashed.

1245
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:28,880
Guess this game isn't very well optimized.

1246
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:33,260
Wow.

1247
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:35,860
I can't believe it.

1248
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,560
That's so weird.

1249
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,140
That's so fucking weird.

1250
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,400
How did my game crash over there?

1251
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:48,240
Well, luckily, I just saved.

1252
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:49,760
So like, thank god.

1253
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:52,440
Thank god.

1254
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:54,480
That I just saved, guys.

1255
01:10:55,180 --> 01:10:56,480
Good thing.

1256
01:10:58,200 --> 01:10:59,340
So...

1257
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:01,120
So weird.

1258
01:11:02,580 --> 01:11:04,680
So weird.

1259
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:17,870
Wow.

1260
01:11:20,570 --> 01:11:21,730
That's it?

1261
01:11:22,690 --> 01:11:23,910
That's it?

1262
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:25,530
I should've just kept going.

1263
01:11:25,850 --> 01:11:27,830
I mean, oh my god.

1264
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:29,410
I can't believe it crashed.

1265
01:11:29,570 --> 01:11:31,010
Oh my god.

1266
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:34,150
Oh my god.

1267
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:40,470
Oh my god.

1268
01:11:42,210 --> 01:11:42,770
Okay.

1269
01:11:44,190 --> 01:11:45,490
Where do we go?

1270
01:11:49,170 --> 01:11:51,250
Where are we supposed to go?

1271
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:02,590
Where are we supposed to go?

1272
01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:04,230
I feel like I'm lost now.

1273
01:12:05,050 --> 01:12:06,410
The lady door?

1274
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:08,570
What the fuck is the lady door?

1275
01:12:09,050 --> 01:12:10,830
I'm so lost.

1276
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:11,650
What is...

1277
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:16,730
Like, where have I been?

1278
01:12:20,430 --> 01:12:21,050
Okay.

1279
01:12:22,030 --> 01:12:22,650
Her?

1280
01:12:23,950 --> 01:12:24,930
Oh, wait.

1281
01:12:25,010 --> 01:12:25,910
The door with the lady?

1282
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:29,910
Wait, what floor was that?

1283
01:12:30,310 --> 01:12:31,110
Give me a sec.

1284
01:12:33,610 --> 01:12:34,510
Second floor.

1285
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:34,910
Okay.

1286
01:12:36,010 --> 01:12:36,910
The second floor.

1287
01:12:36,910 --> 01:12:37,030
The second floor.

1288
01:12:39,490 --> 01:12:40,710
Wow, that's so crazy.

1289
01:12:40,810 --> 01:12:41,730
That crashed it, Maria.

1290
01:12:42,550 --> 01:12:42,990
God.

1291
01:12:43,830 --> 01:12:46,690
Good thing the new AMD just came out.

1292
01:12:51,350 --> 01:12:52,770
That's gonna come in handy.

1293
01:12:52,990 --> 01:12:54,550
Maybe I'll stop crashing that.

1294
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:00,560
God, that lady in the door actually scared me.

1295
01:13:01,540 --> 01:13:02,540
Holy fuck.

1296
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:03,920
She actually scared me.

1297
01:13:10,780 --> 01:13:13,820
It's a freak that they made a door with a lady there.

1298
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:22,500
I'm into this dangerous door.

1299
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:24,440
Nothing's bad is gonna happen.

1300
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:33,420
Oh, you mean the dark fucking...

1301
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:36,340
The room where the entire walls are made of mold?

1302
01:13:36,940 --> 01:13:37,580
Yeah.

1303
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:39,020
That...

1304
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:40,540
The moldy room?

1305
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:42,040
Yeah, no.

1306
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:44,600
There's something off about the moldy room.

1307
01:13:51,570 --> 01:13:52,170
Man.

1308
01:13:52,370 --> 01:13:54,030
I hope that's not black mold.

1309
01:13:54,910 --> 01:13:57,690
I hope it's not black mold over there.

1310
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:06,680
Alright.

1311
01:14:06,980 --> 01:14:08,500
No, this is definitely black mold.

1312
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:10,260
No, I'm...

1313
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:13,540
This is definitely a room full of black mold.

1314
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:15,500
It is done.

1315
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:16,980
Oh shit, what's done?

1316
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:21,640
Wait, what do you mean?

1317
01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:26,760
What do you mean?

1318
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:26,800
What do you mean?

1319
01:14:27,780 --> 01:14:29,920
It's so ominous.

1320
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:32,980
What do you mean it's done?

1321
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:41,040
Oh, down we go.

1322
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:43,700
Down to the staircase of hell.

1323
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:47,460
Hello?

1324
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:50,720
Alright.

1325
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:53,720
Let's just go through this hallway.

1326
01:15:10,980 --> 01:15:11,780
Oh...

1327
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,800
Oh, you...

1328
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:16,220
Run!

1329
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:21,160
Down, come on.

1330
01:15:21,220 --> 01:15:21,780
Keep going.

1331
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:24,100
Are you fucking...

1332
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:25,080
Oh my god.

1333
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:27,180
Oh my god.

1334
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:29,820
Maria, please go faster.

1335
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:32,920
Oh my god.

1336
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,380
How is she faster than me?

1337
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:36,160
She's wearing heels.

1338
01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:38,240
How is she faster?

1339
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:39,140
Oh my god.

1340
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:45,980
I'm wearing flats.

1341
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:47,040
I'm wearing flats.

1342
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:49,020
How are you faster than me, Maria?

1343
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:51,500
Oh, now I'm faster.

1344
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:52,260
Leave her.

1345
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:01,940
Oh, am I gonna watch her die?

1346
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:06,260
Oh, it's alright.

1347
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:07,980
He's just very...

1348
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:09,280
Slowly walking.

1349
01:16:48,150 --> 01:16:49,870
She can die?

1350
01:16:53,530 --> 01:16:54,410
Well...

1351
01:16:54,410 --> 01:16:55,910
Gonna survive November.

1352
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:04,190
We're making it through November, guys.

1353
01:17:04,410 --> 01:17:05,530
We did it.

1354
01:17:05,530 --> 01:17:07,510
We fucking did it.

1355
01:17:09,490 --> 01:17:13,990
When I said leave her, I didn't think we're actually gonna leave her.

1356
01:17:14,090 --> 01:17:14,170
What?

1357
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:16,510
We actually left her.

1358
01:17:16,970 --> 01:17:18,530
Oh my god, I thought that...

1359
01:17:18,530 --> 01:17:20,850
I didn't realize James was gonna listen.

1360
01:17:22,990 --> 01:17:25,190
At least she won't be on front of you now.

1361
01:17:25,470 --> 01:17:28,770
I didn't think James would listen.

1362
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:31,430
He listened to his intrusive thoughts.

1363
01:17:31,470 --> 01:17:32,810
Like, who does that?

1364
01:17:32,810 --> 01:17:35,590
Whoever listens to the intrusive thoughts.

1365
01:17:38,830 --> 01:17:41,220
I didn't think he would actually listen.

1366
01:17:42,490 --> 01:17:44,810
I thought he would...

1367
01:17:46,390 --> 01:17:47,330
You.

1368
01:17:49,630 --> 01:17:52,310
I didn't know he was gonna listen.

1369
01:17:53,910 --> 01:17:56,050
They're intrusive thoughts for a reason.

1370
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:02,250
Can we go outside now?

1371
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:03,770
No.

1372
01:18:04,610 --> 01:18:07,170
Oh, we're on the other world.

1373
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:08,410
Oh, fuck.

1374
01:18:08,510 --> 01:18:08,750
Okay.

1375
01:18:14,530 --> 01:18:15,870
That's crazy.

1376
01:18:16,590 --> 01:18:18,370
Pyramid protecting here.

1377
01:18:18,770 --> 01:18:19,690
And then...

1378
01:18:19,690 --> 01:18:20,770
Challenge boy.

1379
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:23,330
He knew.

1380
01:18:23,830 --> 01:18:24,890
It was like...

1381
01:18:24,890 --> 01:18:26,270
Be gone, wench.

1382
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:29,450
No temptations for my boy.

1383
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:33,130
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

1384
01:18:33,130 --> 01:18:34,390
Thank you, thank you.

1385
01:18:35,850 --> 01:18:37,110
Nice, we got the key.

1386
01:18:39,310 --> 01:18:40,450
He's a real homie.

1387
01:18:40,530 --> 01:18:41,450
He knew it was November.

1388
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:43,290
Oh, there's Laura.

1389
01:18:43,890 --> 01:18:45,590
You think it's raining in her side?

1390
01:18:46,550 --> 01:18:48,810
Is it just because I'm very depressed?

1391
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:50,190
So it starts raining?

1392
01:18:50,410 --> 01:18:51,890
I wonder if it's for her.

1393
01:18:52,410 --> 01:18:54,230
If it's that Silent Hill mod.

1394
01:18:54,330 --> 01:18:56,570
Where everything is sunny.

1395
01:18:57,070 --> 01:18:58,070
And beautiful.

1396
01:18:58,670 --> 01:18:59,870
With no fog.

1397
01:18:59,870 --> 01:19:00,650
Or anything.

1398
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:04,490
I wonder if that's what it looks like for her.

1399
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:11,270
Alright.

1400
01:19:11,970 --> 01:19:13,610
Out in the streets I go.

1401
01:19:13,790 --> 01:19:15,710
Maybe the monsters are scared of rain.

1402
01:19:18,450 --> 01:19:19,790
What was that sound?

1403
01:19:23,450 --> 01:19:25,610
I don't know where I'm supposed to go.

1404
01:19:25,610 --> 01:19:26,730
I don't know where I'm supposed to go.

1405
01:19:38,310 --> 01:19:39,750
Nothing in this car.

1406
01:19:40,830 --> 01:19:42,110
They were not scared of rain.

1407
01:19:42,190 --> 01:19:45,650
They were absolutely not scared of rain.

1408
01:19:45,650 --> 01:19:46,690
They were not scared of rain.

1409
01:19:46,810 --> 01:19:47,990
They were not scared of rain.

1410
01:19:49,270 --> 01:19:49,750
Alright.

1411
01:19:49,930 --> 01:19:50,950
Now we know.

1412
01:19:53,390 --> 01:19:54,390
Now we know.

1413
01:19:54,550 --> 01:19:56,310
They were not scared of rain.

1414
01:19:56,310 --> 01:19:58,430
Now they're gonna be under cars?

1415
01:19:58,530 --> 01:19:59,890
That's actually cheating.

1416
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:07,780
Like, how are they gonna be under cars?

1417
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:10,720
Where am I supposed to go?

1418
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,540
Oh, and there's nurses?

1419
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:17,200
Ma'am, this is the hospital.

1420
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:19,940
How are you outside the hospital?

1421
01:20:24,730 --> 01:20:27,350
I feel like you're the ones that can come back alive.

1422
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:34,520
There's nothing here.

1423
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:35,220
There's nothing even here.

1424
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:39,900
Let's fuck that one bug in particular.

1425
01:20:43,780 --> 01:20:44,880
Oh, fuck.

1426
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:45,180
Okay.

1427
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:49,260
Oh my god.

1428
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:49,560
Okay.

1429
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:53,060
Jeez, that scared the shit out of me.

1430
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:55,480
Of course you're over there.

1431
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:56,820
Of course.

1432
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:00,340
She was just clocking out.

1433
01:21:00,340 --> 01:21:00,960
Doki.

1434
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:05,680
I hear a nurse.

1435
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:07,180
Oh no, I hear that guy.

1436
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:11,440
Wait, before you come in, let me grab this.

1437
01:21:12,180 --> 01:21:14,100
Oh my god, this fucking bug.

1438
01:21:19,050 --> 01:21:19,990
Oh, there you are.

1439
01:21:20,350 --> 01:21:22,690
Okay, these guys, I'm not too scared.

1440
01:21:22,890 --> 01:21:25,290
Like, the crawlers have not gotten me yet.

1441
01:21:28,150 --> 01:21:28,710
Okay.

1442
01:21:31,190 --> 01:21:34,550
I'm gonna say that and I'm gonna fucking get poisoned by one of them.

1443
01:21:34,610 --> 01:21:35,470
I can feel it.

1444
01:21:36,110 --> 01:21:37,310
Knowing my luck.

1445
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:38,390
I can...

1446
01:21:38,390 --> 01:21:39,290
What?

1447
01:21:39,990 --> 01:21:40,270
Why?

1448
01:21:41,570 --> 01:21:43,590
I can see you cross...

1449
01:21:43,590 --> 01:21:45,070
Who are you fooling?

1450
01:21:46,090 --> 01:21:47,690
Oh, he can't see me.

1451
01:21:50,150 --> 01:21:51,910
Oh, he can't see me.

1452
01:21:52,250 --> 01:21:53,510
I'm just crossing the road.

1453
01:21:53,510 --> 01:21:53,610
Oh.

1454
01:21:56,010 --> 01:21:56,370
Okay.

1455
01:21:57,770 --> 01:21:59,310
Okay, I definitely didn't see her though.

1456
01:22:00,830 --> 01:22:02,510
I definitely did not see her though.

1457
01:22:03,890 --> 01:22:04,530
There we go.

1458
01:22:07,930 --> 01:22:09,770
Okay, I'm gonna make sure they don't get me out of there.

1459
01:22:14,710 --> 01:22:15,490
Oh my god.

1460
01:22:15,490 --> 01:22:17,110
Why did she cross the road?

1461
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:19,050
To get to the other side?

1462
01:22:20,710 --> 01:22:21,770
Answering my own question.

1463
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:25,950
Okay.

1464
01:22:25,950 --> 01:22:28,290
I don't like how dark this is.

1465
01:22:29,570 --> 01:22:31,110
Nothing in this car.

1466
01:22:33,590 --> 01:22:34,290
Okay.

1467
01:22:51,170 --> 01:22:52,930
Oh my god.

1468
01:22:53,070 --> 01:22:54,410
There was something...

1469
01:22:57,790 --> 01:23:00,570
There's like something outside my door.

1470
01:23:00,690 --> 01:23:01,770
That's making noises.

1471
01:23:02,350 --> 01:23:03,770
And that like freaked me out.

1472
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:05,670
Cause I thought it was like the game.

1473
01:23:06,590 --> 01:23:08,990
Yeah, dad heard it too.

1474
01:23:09,970 --> 01:23:13,090
I was like...

1475
01:23:13,090 --> 01:23:14,230
What's that sound?

1476
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:18,270
Like somebody was like whistling outside.

1477
01:23:21,670 --> 01:23:23,310
Oh my god.

1478
01:23:25,390 --> 01:23:27,050
Somebody was like whistling.

1479
01:23:27,490 --> 01:23:29,410
And I was like so freaked out.

1480
01:23:29,490 --> 01:23:31,770
Cause I thought it was like...

1481
01:23:31,770 --> 01:23:32,710
Who the fuck is whistling?

1482
01:23:32,910 --> 01:23:33,990
Who the fuck is whistling?

1483
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:44,310
White tape.

1484
01:23:45,190 --> 01:23:47,370
It was so spooky.

1485
01:23:47,530 --> 01:23:48,910
That actually spooked me out.

1486
01:23:53,950 --> 01:23:55,930
A save point.

1487
01:23:56,550 --> 01:23:57,930
We're safe in this area.

1488
01:23:57,930 --> 01:23:58,070
Yeah.

1489
01:24:00,130 --> 01:24:02,790
Silent hill is slowly creeping into my world.

1490
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:10,040
Okay.

1491
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:12,940
Nice meds.

1492
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:14,400
Alright.

1493
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:16,520
Inside.

1494
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:17,980
Laura!

1495
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:20,820
Laura, please!

1496
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,240
I saw a woman die!

1497
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:23,420
Please, Laura!

1498
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:26,000
What the fuck are you doing?

1499
01:24:26,180 --> 01:24:26,860
Oh, you know what?

1500
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:28,760
Like this.

1501
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,660
Oh my god, I feel like I can like...

1502
01:24:34,660 --> 01:24:37,000
I feel like now I literally have like...

1503
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Silent hill vision.

1504
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:40,860
Like I can feel when...

1505
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:43,080
What?!

1506
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:43,540
Okay.

1507
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:45,620
Nevermind.

1508
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:48,880
Nevermind, except for her.

1509
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:52,980
Wait, did she...

1510
01:24:54,020 --> 01:24:54,640
What?!

1511
01:24:58,430 --> 01:24:59,070
Nevermind.

1512
01:24:59,330 --> 01:25:00,190
No, I do not.

1513
01:25:01,210 --> 01:25:02,130
No, I do not.

1514
01:25:02,410 --> 01:25:03,710
Apparently, I didn't double tap.

1515
01:25:04,890 --> 01:25:05,530
Nevermind.

1516
01:25:05,630 --> 01:25:08,650
I do not have silent hill vision.

1517
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:16,880
Fucking hell.

1518
01:25:19,060 --> 01:25:19,460
Okay.

1519
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:21,980
I thought I did.

1520
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:24,020
I was too overconfident.

1521
01:25:24,020 --> 01:25:24,120
I was too overconfident.

1522
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:28,880
No, it was like one.

1523
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:31,480
It was two, but I forgot to double tap.

1524
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:33,040
The first one.

1525
01:25:36,740 --> 01:25:37,740
Come on, climb up.

1526
01:25:38,580 --> 01:25:39,080
Climb up!

1527
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:42,400
Climb up!

1528
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:45,720
Oh my god, how are you not locked in?

1529
01:25:49,820 --> 01:25:51,780
I'm gonna drink some tea.

1530
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:57,300
Oh my god, what was the difference?

1531
01:25:57,820 --> 01:25:58,640
What was the difference?

1532
01:25:58,780 --> 01:25:59,380
It was...

1533
01:25:59,380 --> 01:25:59,910
Oh, James!

1534
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:03,600
Oh, James!

1535
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:05,060
Okay.

1536
01:26:12,150 --> 01:26:14,250
I don't know what was the difference.

1537
01:26:16,890 --> 01:26:18,490
I'm getting rid of all the nurses.

1538
01:26:18,930 --> 01:26:19,290
Like...

1539
01:26:19,290 --> 01:26:20,990
Okay, when I can hit them.

1540
01:26:22,410 --> 01:26:24,110
I just don't trust myself.

1541
01:26:24,270 --> 01:26:26,490
I don't trust myself anymore.

1542
01:26:26,490 --> 01:26:26,770
Okay.

1543
01:26:29,650 --> 01:26:33,170
Like, I feel like if I don't get rid of them, I'm gonna die.

1544
01:26:35,510 --> 01:26:36,030
Ben!

1545
01:26:36,450 --> 01:26:37,950
Welcome to the tomato farm!

1546
01:26:38,050 --> 01:26:38,810
Welcome, welcome!

1547
01:26:40,170 --> 01:26:42,490
Oh, I can...

1548
01:26:43,570 --> 01:26:44,810
There we go.

1549
01:26:45,370 --> 01:26:46,870
I'm not scared of these guys.

1550
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:54,420
What?!

1551
01:26:55,180 --> 01:26:55,700
What?!

1552
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:57,760
Oh my god!

1553
01:26:58,280 --> 01:26:59,820
Congratulations, your very first kill.

1554
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:03,280
Oh my god.

1555
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:06,080
This has to be the very first time these guys...

1556
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:07,280
The crawlers has hit me.

1557
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:09,480
Like, the very...

1558
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:10,920
Congratulations.

1559
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:13,500
You've done it, my man.

1560
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:15,740
The very first time...

1561
01:27:15,740 --> 01:27:17,720
A crawler has actually...

1562
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:19,100
Managed to hit me.

1563
01:27:23,250 --> 01:27:25,870
I was like, following the trail of blood.

1564
01:27:28,350 --> 01:27:30,490
I hope you're proud of yourself, man.

1565
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:38,320
You just take three shots, so like, it's not...

1566
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:39,880
Oh, please, I need ammo!

1567
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:40,540
Please!

1568
01:27:42,420 --> 01:27:42,880
Oh?

1569
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:44,620
Oh, it's a bug.

1570
01:27:45,540 --> 01:27:45,780
Oh!

1571
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:49,040
Okay, I thought I heard something here.

1572
01:27:51,620 --> 01:27:52,720
Oh, okay, I did.

1573
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:53,360
I knew it.

1574
01:27:54,380 --> 01:27:58,920
Oh, one, two, three, four.

1575
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:00,900
You're not crawling here!

1576
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:05,780
No crawling allowed!

1577
01:28:06,860 --> 01:28:07,780
Is there ammo?

1578
01:28:07,980 --> 01:28:09,700
God damn it, I need handgun ammo.

1579
01:28:09,940 --> 01:28:11,180
I need handgun ammo.

1580
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:12,760
Oh, thank you.

1581
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:14,440
I used so many.

1582
01:28:16,860 --> 01:28:17,300
Whoa!

1583
01:28:17,420 --> 01:28:17,620
Whoa!

1584
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:23,880
Oh my god.

1585
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:26,000
Okay.

1586
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:27,120
That's fine.

1587
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:27,280
Oh my god.

1588
01:28:28,660 --> 01:28:31,360
Oh, where the fuck did she come from?

1589
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:33,740
What?

1590
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:34,480
What?

1591
01:28:35,020 --> 01:28:35,480
What?

1592
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:38,380
What was that?

1593
01:28:41,690 --> 01:28:42,590
The fuck?

1594
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:47,460
The fuck was that?

1595
01:28:53,340 --> 01:28:54,640
Did I kill everything?

1596
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:59,260
Oh, I thought a monster was gonna jump down.

1597
01:28:59,660 --> 01:29:01,520
Oh, that was scary.

1598
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:05,980
I actually thought something was gonna jump down.

1599
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:12,880
Oh.

1600
01:29:21,220 --> 01:29:21,900
What?

1601
01:29:22,420 --> 01:29:23,340
I can't believe you're crawling.

1602
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:24,880
Don't you crawl and get spread!

1603
01:29:25,580 --> 01:29:26,800
Explode, you bitch!

1604
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:31,520
I think I didn't see.

1605
01:29:40,060 --> 01:29:41,080
There we go.

1606
01:29:43,060 --> 01:29:43,740
Okay.

1607
01:29:43,740 --> 01:29:43,860
Okay.

1608
01:29:48,260 --> 01:29:48,780
Whoa!

1609
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:50,660
Oh my god, okay, I didn't see that.

1610
01:29:51,140 --> 01:29:52,180
I definitely didn't see that.

1611
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,280
Oh no, what a waste.

1612
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:56,180
Okay, there you go.

1613
01:29:57,560 --> 01:29:58,840
Are you serious?

1614
01:29:59,140 --> 01:30:00,900
That's right, get down.

1615
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:02,140
Get down!

1616
01:30:04,460 --> 01:30:04,980
Okay.

1617
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:07,380
Gotta use more of these dirty needles.

1618
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:09,320
Oh, don't worry.

1619
01:30:09,380 --> 01:30:11,540
The doctor said everything will be fine.

1620
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:16,060
He said it'll be okay.

1621
01:30:16,740 --> 01:30:18,700
These dirty needles will be fine.

1622
01:30:19,780 --> 01:30:20,700
Go to the other side.

1623
01:30:24,940 --> 01:30:25,860
Yeah, good.

1624
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,680
I need all the ammo I can get.

1625
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:30,580
Oh, get me out of Silent Hill!

1626
01:30:31,420 --> 01:30:34,260
Get me out of Silent, Dark, and Scary Hill!

1627
01:30:38,020 --> 01:30:40,800
I don't wanna be in the other world anymore.

1628
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:42,900
Please.

1629
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:47,860
I'm pretty sure this is acid rain, too.

1630
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:49,090
There's no way.

1631
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:53,120
Silent Hill doesn't seem very environmentally friendly.

1632
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:58,930
If anything, I'd be surprised if it's regular rain.

1633
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:11,140
Any loot?

1634
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:12,360
Any loot?

1635
01:31:12,420 --> 01:31:13,040
I'm desperate.

1636
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:13,180
I'm desperate.

1637
01:31:22,140 --> 01:31:22,700
Hello?

1638
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:25,600
Where am I?

1639
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:27,860
I go to the light?

1640
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:32,420
That's what they always tell you, to go to the light, doggie!

1641
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:34,280
Go to the light!

1642
01:31:35,660 --> 01:31:36,520
Oh, there she is!

1643
01:31:37,020 --> 01:31:38,720
There she is, you little bitch!

1644
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:42,080
Please, Laura!

1645
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:42,120
Laura!

1646
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:47,240
Oh, fucking hell, I hate this girl.

1647
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:49,740
That's why children are a mistake.

1648
01:31:53,420 --> 01:31:55,120
Children are a mistake!

1649
01:31:57,320 --> 01:31:58,600
I saw something.

1650
01:32:03,020 --> 01:32:06,480
I don't think things were supposed to be on that ground.

1651
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:10,920
I mean, she's an orphan.

1652
01:32:11,060 --> 01:32:12,680
She is a mistake.

1653
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:20,220
Damn!

1654
01:32:23,340 --> 01:32:24,220
Am I not?

1655
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:25,120
Am I wrong?

1656
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:26,260
Am I wrong?

1657
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:27,520
Tell me I'm wrong.

1658
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:30,600
Jesus, doggie.

1659
01:32:30,780 --> 01:32:31,900
That's a child.

1660
01:32:33,340 --> 01:32:34,840
But am I wrong?

1661
01:32:35,620 --> 01:32:36,880
Tell me I'm wrong.

1662
01:32:36,980 --> 01:32:37,480
You can't.

1663
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:38,440
You know I'm right.

1664
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:40,540
You know I'm right.

1665
01:32:40,580 --> 01:32:41,820
You're a bitch.

1666
01:32:56,540 --> 01:32:57,400
Wait,

1667
01:33:01,140 --> 01:33:01,860
it's stronger.

1668
01:33:02,220 --> 01:33:03,200
It should be stronger.

1669
01:33:07,140 --> 01:33:08,480
Where's the wrench?

1670
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:10,560
Why is this so far?

1671
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:13,580
Okay.

1672
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:15,280
Alright.

1673
01:33:15,740 --> 01:33:18,780
Time to get this stupid fucking wrench too, I guess.

1674
01:33:22,870 --> 01:33:24,330
You are wrong, doggie.

1675
01:33:24,670 --> 01:33:26,710
Her parents could have died.

1676
01:33:27,210 --> 01:33:28,590
But you don't know that!

1677
01:33:28,930 --> 01:33:30,110
You don't know that.

1678
01:33:30,730 --> 01:33:33,910
So there's a possibility that she was a mistake.

1679
01:33:35,030 --> 01:33:35,850
She's an orphan.

1680
01:33:35,850 --> 01:33:35,950
She's an orphan.

1681
01:33:38,690 --> 01:33:40,870
I think he was a super chat D-Dragon.

1682
01:33:40,970 --> 01:33:41,290
Thank you.

1683
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:49,900
Okay.

1684
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:52,560
Just gotta be sure he's dead dead.

1685
01:33:56,130 --> 01:33:57,150
What the fuck?

1686
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:04,060
At least she opened that door.

1687
01:34:05,540 --> 01:34:06,060
Oh shit.

1688
01:34:06,380 --> 01:34:07,240
Oh fuck!

1689
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:12,300
Oh my god, I did not dodge.

1690
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:13,880
I thought she would be dead by now.

1691
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:16,220
I legitimately thought she was gonna die.

1692
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:21,640
I didn't do this.

1693
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:23,020
This was just to get meds.

1694
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:23,320
Okay.

1695
01:34:31,460 --> 01:34:31,940
Okay.

1696
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:34,100
Oh my god.

1697
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:36,580
I don't know if I want to go up to this area.

1698
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:37,880
But I guess I will.

1699
01:34:39,100 --> 01:34:40,280
I guess I will.

1700
01:34:44,620 --> 01:34:46,760
Okay, maybe that was not a good idea.

1701
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:50,800
Everyone's died.

1702
01:34:51,380 --> 01:34:51,840
Whoop.

1703
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:54,060
Thank god.

1704
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:56,720
Thank god he's weak as fuck!

1705
01:34:56,720 --> 01:34:58,300
There we go.

1706
01:34:58,580 --> 01:35:00,200
Can't get...

1707
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:01,560
She doesn't spit on me.

1708
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:07,480
Hello?

1709
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:09,100
Oh, there she is.

1710
01:35:12,750 --> 01:35:13,230
Okay.

1711
01:35:13,830 --> 01:35:16,810
At least I know it's like three tap for these ladies.

1712
01:35:19,390 --> 01:35:20,750
It's just...

1713
01:35:21,470 --> 01:35:22,790
Fucking hell!

1714
01:35:23,110 --> 01:35:23,870
Every time!

1715
01:35:25,130 --> 01:35:26,250
Every time!

1716
01:35:26,370 --> 01:35:29,470
I'm not even gonna waste my...

1717
01:35:29,470 --> 01:35:29,910
Oh my god!

1718
01:35:30,130 --> 01:35:32,430
I'm gonna syringe up though.

1719
01:35:33,230 --> 01:35:34,410
I'm gonna syringe up.

1720
01:35:34,850 --> 01:35:36,290
I'm not gonna...

1721
01:35:36,290 --> 01:35:37,930
I'm gonna waste meds!

1722
01:35:38,190 --> 01:35:39,590
I'm gonna waste meds!

1723
01:35:41,710 --> 01:35:42,730
It's fine.

1724
01:35:43,350 --> 01:35:45,090
I have so many meds anyway.

1725
01:35:45,970 --> 01:35:47,170
I have so many meds.

1726
01:35:47,270 --> 01:35:47,830
It's fine.

1727
01:35:51,170 --> 01:35:52,150
I'm fucking...

1728
01:35:52,150 --> 01:35:52,550
Okay.

1729
01:35:54,010 --> 01:35:55,310
Are you serious?

1730
01:35:55,310 --> 01:35:55,570
Are you serious?

1731
01:35:56,810 --> 01:35:57,470
There we go.

1732
01:35:58,550 --> 01:35:59,470
Wait, what bit me?

1733
01:36:00,630 --> 01:36:01,650
Are you...

1734
01:36:01,650 --> 01:36:04,630
Oh, I didn't even come back up!

1735
01:36:04,650 --> 01:36:05,230
Your little...

1736
01:36:05,230 --> 01:36:06,770
Buddy here.

1737
01:36:10,230 --> 01:36:12,650
His little fucking best friend.

1738
01:36:14,270 --> 01:36:15,110
There's nothing here.

1739
01:36:16,630 --> 01:36:17,690
There's nothing here.

1740
01:36:18,410 --> 01:36:19,550
It was just to fuck with me.

1741
01:36:20,030 --> 01:36:21,130
Of course there was nothing here.

1742
01:36:21,130 --> 01:36:23,490
Everything is here to fuck with you.

1743
01:36:23,850 --> 01:36:24,690
Of course.

1744
01:36:26,130 --> 01:36:27,070
Of course.

1745
01:36:27,690 --> 01:36:28,370
Of course.

1746
01:36:28,810 --> 01:36:29,530
It's Silent Hill.

1747
01:36:29,670 --> 01:36:31,170
It's Silent Dark and Scary Hill.

1748
01:36:43,940 --> 01:36:44,620
Stop.

1749
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:48,580
Stop.

1750
01:36:48,700 --> 01:36:49,220
Just...

1751
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:49,620
Stop.

1752
01:36:50,580 --> 01:36:51,600
Just stop.

1753
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:00,640
Silent Dark and Scary Hill.

1754
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:02,880
Just another day.

1755
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:04,880
At my favorite place.

1756
01:37:10,220 --> 01:37:10,780
Okay.

1757
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:19,280
Anything here?

1758
01:37:23,320 --> 01:37:24,480
Fucking knew it.

1759
01:37:25,660 --> 01:37:27,040
Why do you always go on the others?

1760
01:37:27,140 --> 01:37:27,700
I should be...

1761
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:29,960
I knew it.

1762
01:37:30,140 --> 01:37:30,740
I knew it.

1763
01:37:31,860 --> 01:37:35,960
I knew I can't get the ammo for free.

1764
01:37:37,260 --> 01:37:39,480
I never get anything my way.

1765
01:37:39,980 --> 01:37:41,760
Like my wife's dead!

1766
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:42,760
I should get...

1767
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:43,520
I should have one.

1768
01:37:43,620 --> 01:37:45,120
I should have like a plus one.

1769
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:49,760
Like I should get at least one good day.

1770
01:37:50,620 --> 01:37:52,500
One good day.

1771
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:56,860
Alright.

1772
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:02,680
Back to the save.

1773
01:38:06,570 --> 01:38:07,170
Alright.

1774
01:38:07,430 --> 01:38:08,490
Oh, nice ammo.

1775
01:38:10,150 --> 01:38:10,590
Oh.

1776
01:38:11,030 --> 01:38:12,050
Back to 40 bullets.

1777
01:38:12,230 --> 01:38:13,150
Thank God.

1778
01:38:16,050 --> 01:38:18,310
If you really want to see Mary, you should just die.

1779
01:38:18,650 --> 01:38:21,070
But you might be heading to a different place than Mary, James.

1780
01:38:21,110 --> 01:38:22,310
Who the fuck wrote this?

1781
01:38:22,730 --> 01:38:24,430
With the nicest handwriting.

1782
01:38:24,750 --> 01:38:25,630
And that is not blood.

1783
01:38:26,730 --> 01:38:27,930
You know how I know this?

1784
01:38:28,010 --> 01:38:29,930
Because blood would like...

1785
01:38:29,930 --> 01:38:31,750
Blood is not like that color.

1786
01:38:33,250 --> 01:38:34,130
That cannot...

1787
01:38:34,130 --> 01:38:36,470
That looks too good for blood.

1788
01:38:36,470 --> 01:38:38,430
Like especially the writing itself.

1789
01:38:38,970 --> 01:38:39,470
That's...

1790
01:38:39,470 --> 01:38:43,070
He used like fucking like a paint or some shit.

1791
01:38:43,990 --> 01:38:44,590
That's...

1792
01:38:44,590 --> 01:38:45,790
It looks like a lipstick.

1793
01:38:47,510 --> 01:38:48,750
That's not blood.

1794
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:54,400
Yeah.

1795
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:56,680
It would be brown if it was blood.

1796
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:59,800
Like this fucking guy took some lipstick and was like...

1797
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:00,800
I'm gonna make it spooky.

1798
01:39:03,060 --> 01:39:05,640
I'm gonna double check if I can go...

1799
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:06,460
If there's anything here.

1800
01:39:10,470 --> 01:39:11,550
Happy burger.

1801
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:18,860
Oh, there's ammo.

1802
01:39:21,820 --> 01:39:22,480
Okay.

1803
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:25,460
Grab the ammo first.

1804
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:29,440
Before we go be happy.

1805
01:39:32,060 --> 01:39:34,260
Can you come through this window?

1806
01:39:35,180 --> 01:39:36,200
I actually want to know.

1807
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:39,040
Oh my god, parkour!

1808
01:39:42,260 --> 01:39:43,820
Oh my god!

1809
01:39:43,820 --> 01:39:48,300
Oh my god!

1810
01:39:48,300 --> 01:39:48,320
Parkour.

1811
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:49,740
I can do it too.

1812
01:39:53,720 --> 01:39:55,520
One more lady here.

1813
01:39:58,440 --> 01:39:59,020
Oops.

1814
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:02,140
Oh!

1815
01:40:02,140 --> 01:40:02,620
Fuck!

1816
01:40:02,700 --> 01:40:02,880
Okay.

1817
01:40:03,680 --> 01:40:04,260
Okay.

1818
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:05,100
Okay.

1819
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:05,720
Fuck off!

1820
01:40:06,420 --> 01:40:07,000
Parkour.

1821
01:40:07,160 --> 01:40:07,520
Get me out.

1822
01:40:07,660 --> 01:40:08,120
Parkour.

1823
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:08,980
Get me out of here.

1824
01:40:12,660 --> 01:40:13,480
That's fine.

1825
01:40:16,060 --> 01:40:16,740
Alright.

1826
01:40:17,140 --> 01:40:19,560
I think I'll fight here.

1827
01:40:21,180 --> 01:40:21,860
Okay.

1828
01:40:22,020 --> 01:40:22,340
Nice.

1829
01:40:25,140 --> 01:40:25,660
Alright.

1830
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:26,480
There you go.

1831
01:40:27,260 --> 01:40:29,220
There was even a bug.

1832
01:40:29,460 --> 01:40:32,600
They brought a bug to the fight.

1833
01:40:35,060 --> 01:40:36,020
Oh my god.

1834
01:40:36,020 --> 01:40:37,200
There's another one.

1835
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:40,820
Who does that?

1836
01:40:43,540 --> 01:40:44,240
Okay.

1837
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:44,640
There's another?

1838
01:40:44,940 --> 01:40:45,740
There's another one.

1839
01:40:50,570 --> 01:40:52,570
I'll grab the ammo first.

1840
01:40:55,490 --> 01:40:56,910
Thank god they waited.

1841
01:40:57,870 --> 01:40:59,910
Thank god they went one by one.

1842
01:41:00,610 --> 01:41:01,530
Two by two.

1843
01:41:09,390 --> 01:41:10,440
Oh shit!

1844
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:12,060
Okay.

1845
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:13,800
Okay.

1846
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:14,560
That works.

1847
01:41:14,740 --> 01:41:14,980
That works.

1848
01:41:15,060 --> 01:41:15,460
That works.

1849
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:16,460
That works.

1850
01:41:17,080 --> 01:41:18,740
They respected the one by one.

1851
01:41:19,980 --> 01:41:21,520
And I appreciate that.

1852
01:41:22,360 --> 01:41:23,180
What the fuck?

1853
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:24,780
Okay.

1854
01:41:25,020 --> 01:41:25,440
Help!

1855
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:29,300
I looked at my...

1856
01:41:29,300 --> 01:41:29,760
Okay.

1857
01:41:30,260 --> 01:41:30,720
Alright.

1858
01:41:32,060 --> 01:41:32,940
She's like, no!

1859
01:41:33,060 --> 01:41:33,700
My husband!

1860
01:41:34,940 --> 01:41:36,240
My husband!

1861
01:41:41,290 --> 01:41:42,510
Where am I?

1862
01:41:46,430 --> 01:41:47,110
Like...

1863
01:41:49,430 --> 01:41:50,110
Like...

1864
01:41:50,110 --> 01:41:51,630
Am I supposed to be here?

1865
01:41:56,050 --> 01:41:56,730
Oh.

1866
01:41:58,490 --> 01:42:00,550
She looked like she was posing.

1867
01:42:01,950 --> 01:42:04,070
She was like having a photoshoot there.

1868
01:42:04,750 --> 01:42:05,290
Whoops.

1869
01:42:07,090 --> 01:42:08,150
Is that it?

1870
01:42:08,530 --> 01:42:09,450
Wait, I'm back here.

1871
01:42:10,790 --> 01:42:11,690
Wait, what?

1872
01:42:18,730 --> 01:42:19,870
Wait, what?

1873
01:42:25,980 --> 01:42:27,000
Have I been here before?

1874
01:42:34,370 --> 01:42:35,450
Has I been here?

1875
01:42:36,350 --> 01:42:40,240
I can't remember.

1876
01:42:41,900 --> 01:42:42,960
I can't...

1877
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:44,120
I can't...

1878
01:42:44,120 --> 01:42:46,400
The map is so confusing.

1879
01:42:47,540 --> 01:42:48,040
No!

1880
01:42:54,660 --> 01:42:56,180
Like, where am I?

1881
01:42:58,140 --> 01:42:59,200
Oh my god.

1882
01:42:59,300 --> 01:43:00,800
I already used too much ammo.

1883
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:00,980
Oh.

1884
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:05,440
Yeah.

1885
01:43:05,720 --> 01:43:06,540
Oh, fuck.

1886
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:07,300
Dodge!

1887
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:12,140
I used too much ammo.

1888
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:14,280
I'm so confused.

1889
01:43:14,460 --> 01:43:15,600
Where is this place?

1890
01:43:18,700 --> 01:43:20,380
Why do I have to go here?

1891
01:43:24,930 --> 01:43:27,170
I feel like I've been here before.

1892
01:43:28,710 --> 01:43:29,390
Yeah.

1893
01:43:29,390 --> 01:43:29,570
Yeah.

1894
01:43:31,650 --> 01:43:32,770
Yeah!

1895
01:43:33,150 --> 01:43:33,870
I killed...

1896
01:43:36,410 --> 01:43:37,530
What?!

1897
01:43:39,010 --> 01:43:40,910
I have been here!

1898
01:43:43,210 --> 01:43:45,010
Oh my god.

1899
01:43:45,070 --> 01:43:46,130
It loops!

1900
01:43:47,350 --> 01:43:48,990
It loops!

1901
01:43:53,640 --> 01:43:55,640
God dammit.

1902
01:43:57,020 --> 01:43:59,100
I looped around.

1903
01:43:59,100 --> 01:44:01,460
I looped around.

1904
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:04,920
Alright, we go this way.

1905
01:44:05,480 --> 01:44:06,000
I knew it.

1906
01:44:06,040 --> 01:44:07,180
I was like, wait a minute.

1907
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:10,060
Why is this place so familiar?

1908
01:44:14,280 --> 01:44:15,220
Fucking hell.

1909
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:16,540
Oh my god.

1910
01:44:17,740 --> 01:44:19,260
That's actually cheating.

1911
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:21,920
He like...

1912
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:23,140
Did you see where he hid?

1913
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:27,540
Oh, you're gonna fucking do that again?!

1914
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:31,040
I'm dying!

1915
01:44:32,280 --> 01:44:33,200
Oh, whoa.

1916
01:44:37,510 --> 01:44:37,950
Oops.

1917
01:44:39,950 --> 01:44:41,410
You don't want me to be angry.

1918
01:44:41,610 --> 01:44:42,710
I got a little too angry.

1919
01:44:43,190 --> 01:44:43,490
Oops.

1920
01:44:46,890 --> 01:44:49,250
Alright, this is what happens when you make Doki too angry.

1921
01:44:49,310 --> 01:44:50,030
You don't want that.

1922
01:44:52,170 --> 01:44:54,550
You don't want to make Doki too angry there.

1923
01:45:01,810 --> 01:45:03,010
This is what happens.

1924
01:45:03,170 --> 01:45:04,970
This is exactly what happens.

1925
01:45:06,570 --> 01:45:08,050
What did you do?

1926
01:45:08,530 --> 01:45:09,830
Oh, you don't want to make me...

1927
01:45:09,830 --> 01:45:10,950
You don't want to know.

1928
01:45:11,730 --> 01:45:16,660
I have to go this way.

1929
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:19,300
Wait, what?

1930
01:45:20,380 --> 01:45:21,520
What's over there?

1931
01:45:22,760 --> 01:45:23,740
What's this?

1932
01:45:26,020 --> 01:45:27,980
Oh, from the original game.

1933
01:45:43,390 --> 01:45:44,610
Oh, thank god, meds.

1934
01:45:45,790 --> 01:45:47,890
Okay, there's a door here.

1935
01:45:48,330 --> 01:45:49,630
What about here?

1936
01:45:51,130 --> 01:45:51,990
Okay, nothing.

1937
01:45:52,190 --> 01:45:53,350
Oh, ammo.

1938
01:45:54,370 --> 01:45:55,670
That's the OG map.

1939
01:45:56,410 --> 01:46:01,110
I like how they do, like, references to, like, the original game.

1940
01:46:01,610 --> 01:46:02,830
Planted everywhere.

1941
01:46:03,530 --> 01:46:04,690
I think that's pretty cool.

1942
01:46:05,910 --> 01:46:07,890
But it's so far.

1943
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:12,520
Whoa!

1944
01:46:15,140 --> 01:46:16,380
God damn it.

1945
01:46:16,740 --> 01:46:17,840
Oh my god!

1946
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,240
No, it's too sexy!

1947
01:46:19,540 --> 01:46:20,160
No, it's November!

1948
01:46:31,100 --> 01:46:32,300
Not November.

1949
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:33,280
Not November.

1950
01:46:36,220 --> 01:46:36,820
Alright.

1951
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:37,580
Nice.

1952
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:40,040
I should grab some ammo, too.

1953
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:43,280
In case you don't understand.

1954
01:46:44,040 --> 01:46:45,400
I gotta stay strong.

1955
01:46:45,660 --> 01:46:46,860
I made it this far.

1956
01:46:47,240 --> 01:46:48,840
We're almost halfway there.

1957
01:46:48,840 --> 01:46:49,560
Oh my god.

1958
01:46:52,140 --> 01:46:53,600
We're almost halfway.

1959
01:47:03,310 --> 01:47:05,630
Oh no, he is absolutely a legs man.

1960
01:47:05,810 --> 01:47:07,250
Like, look at all these monsters.

1961
01:47:07,550 --> 01:47:08,510
And they're wearing heels.

1962
01:47:09,410 --> 01:47:11,130
And their ankles are exposed.

1963
01:47:11,170 --> 01:47:13,070
Okay, more than their ankles were exposed.

1964
01:47:13,350 --> 01:47:17,050
A lot more than just their ankles.

1965
01:47:22,450 --> 01:47:25,310
I feel like it's like they're not wearing anything.

1966
01:47:25,850 --> 01:47:28,190
Nothing at all.

1967
01:47:32,610 --> 01:47:33,250
Alright.

1968
01:47:37,990 --> 01:47:39,090
Okay, nice.

1969
01:47:39,730 --> 01:47:41,050
More meds.

1970
01:47:42,110 --> 01:47:43,030
Oh my god.

1971
01:47:44,870 --> 01:47:46,130
What the fuck?

1972
01:47:46,250 --> 01:47:47,310
Where did she come from?

1973
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:54,120
Sorry, I panicked there.

1974
01:47:54,300 --> 01:47:55,160
I panicked.

1975
01:47:55,160 --> 01:47:57,160
I panicked.

1976
01:47:58,400 --> 01:48:00,820
Oh my god, that's two wasted bullets.

1977
01:48:01,080 --> 01:48:01,940
It was too close.

1978
01:48:02,020 --> 01:48:03,080
I was not used to it.

1979
01:48:03,380 --> 01:48:06,500
I was not used to nurses being right beside me.

1980
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:12,440
Oh, what?

1981
01:48:12,760 --> 01:48:12,980
Wait.

1982
01:48:13,180 --> 01:48:13,480
Wait.

1983
01:48:15,660 --> 01:48:17,540
Today is not an aim day, okay?

1984
01:48:17,860 --> 01:48:19,180
I told you guys.

1985
01:48:19,720 --> 01:48:21,480
Today is not an aim day.

1986
01:48:21,480 --> 01:48:23,730
I told you guys.

1987
01:48:25,210 --> 01:48:28,060
Today is not a good day to shoot my gun.

1988
01:48:29,880 --> 01:48:31,760
Oh, now you run away.

1989
01:48:32,420 --> 01:48:34,660
Now you run away.

1990
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:36,560
Where did she run to?

1991
01:48:36,980 --> 01:48:38,220
What the fuck?

1992
01:48:40,680 --> 01:48:42,080
Oh my god, fuck.

1993
01:48:45,250 --> 01:48:45,880
Thank god.

1994
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:48,180
Alright, there we go.

1995
01:48:51,700 --> 01:48:52,960
And her friend.

1996
01:48:54,040 --> 01:48:55,620
Never skip aim day.

1997
01:48:56,140 --> 01:48:57,580
It's just one of those days.

1998
01:48:57,940 --> 01:48:59,600
Sometimes it doesn't work, guys.

1999
01:48:59,620 --> 01:49:00,460
Because I'm tired.

2000
01:49:01,260 --> 01:49:03,620
It just happens.

2001
01:49:11,080 --> 01:49:13,020
Sometimes you're tired.

2002
01:49:13,620 --> 01:49:15,600
It's one of those days.

2003
01:49:15,940 --> 01:49:22,000
Because you know when you're tired and it just doesn't work the same.

2004
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:29,980
Relatable.

2005
01:49:32,690 --> 01:49:35,240
You're like, it's not you.

2006
01:49:36,570 --> 01:49:37,600
It's me.

2007
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:41,800
Thank you for the super chat.

2008
01:49:41,940 --> 01:49:46,760
This doesn't normally happen.

2009
01:49:46,760 --> 01:49:46,960
Eww.

2010
01:49:55,970 --> 01:49:56,510
Hello?

2011
01:49:58,250 --> 01:49:58,790
What?

2012
01:50:08,370 --> 01:50:09,690
Oh shit, free money.

2013
01:50:15,220 --> 01:50:15,880
What's this?

2014
01:50:20,940 --> 01:50:22,300
Perhaps you are a fool.

2015
01:50:23,080 --> 01:50:24,640
The truth usually betrays people.

2016
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:25,740
You should know.

2017
01:50:26,220 --> 01:50:27,360
The key is in the park.

2018
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:29,400
At the feet of the praying woman.

2019
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:31,320
The wrench will open the gate.

2020
01:50:31,600 --> 01:50:33,440
The key will let loose in the abyss.

2021
01:50:34,040 --> 01:50:34,640
Okay.

2022
01:50:34,740 --> 01:50:36,840
Oh shit, where the fuck did that come from?

2023
01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:37,560
Alright.

2024
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:41,000
Alright.

2025
01:50:41,320 --> 01:50:43,800
Wow, the telephone key birthed to a wrench.

2026
01:50:45,860 --> 01:50:47,000
Oh fuck.

2027
01:50:47,120 --> 01:50:48,240
Okay, it's all the way over there.

2028
01:50:48,440 --> 01:50:48,840
Alright.

2029
01:50:50,040 --> 01:50:51,640
Jesus Christ, okay.

2030
01:50:56,700 --> 01:50:58,080
Why is it so far?

2031
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:00,620
Why is this town so big?

2032
01:51:02,120 --> 01:51:04,560
Oh my god, we should downsize this area.

2033
01:51:10,340 --> 01:51:10,880
Nice.

2034
01:51:12,700 --> 01:51:14,640
We don't care about the child anymore.

2035
01:51:14,780 --> 01:51:16,020
She was a mistake anyway.

2036
01:51:17,420 --> 01:51:18,060
You can't sit?

2037
01:51:18,160 --> 01:51:18,720
Yes I can.

2038
01:51:19,780 --> 01:51:21,160
She's gonna fucking get me.

2039
01:51:21,260 --> 01:51:22,420
Her fucking dead parents?

2040
01:51:23,220 --> 01:51:25,620
I don't know, her parents abandoned her?

2041
01:51:26,780 --> 01:51:27,860
Who's gonna catch me?

2042
01:51:36,910 --> 01:51:37,450
Woah!

2043
01:51:44,230 --> 01:51:46,190
Am I supposed to go here?

2044
01:51:50,150 --> 01:51:51,330
Oh my god, my schedule tweet went out?

2045
01:51:51,430 --> 01:51:53,590
Thanks guys, I had to schedule that out.

2046
01:51:53,790 --> 01:51:55,170
There was too many...

2047
01:51:55,860 --> 01:51:57,510
I had too many stuff.

2048
01:51:57,830 --> 01:51:58,750
Oh my god.

2049
01:52:05,380 --> 01:52:06,440
Which way?

2050
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:09,980
Okay, not this way.

2051
01:52:10,660 --> 01:52:12,000
Is there any stuff in here?

2052
01:52:12,660 --> 01:52:13,220
No.

2053
01:52:15,680 --> 01:52:16,300
No.

2054
01:52:17,320 --> 01:52:18,840
Alright, we go straight.

2055
01:52:23,050 --> 01:52:24,050
There's this like...

2056
01:52:24,050 --> 01:52:24,730
I have a neighbor.

2057
01:52:25,910 --> 01:52:27,070
And like everyday...

2058
01:52:28,290 --> 01:52:29,510
He like blasts...

2059
01:52:29,510 --> 01:52:30,630
I wonder if he hears me.

2060
01:52:30,810 --> 01:52:32,150
I wonder if like...

2061
01:52:32,150 --> 01:52:34,670
He hears me and so he blasts.

2062
01:52:36,390 --> 01:52:37,510
My bad.

2063
01:52:37,870 --> 01:52:39,110
My bad.

2064
01:52:39,530 --> 01:52:41,070
I'm pretty sure maybe that's why.

2065
01:52:41,450 --> 01:52:43,830
But basically, I can hear his music.

2066
01:52:45,130 --> 01:52:46,090
Next door.

2067
01:52:46,090 --> 01:52:46,130
Next door.

2068
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:50,850
Maybe that's...

2069
01:52:50,850 --> 01:52:51,910
Maybe it's me.

2070
01:52:52,350 --> 01:52:55,330
Maybe I'm...

2071
01:52:55,330 --> 01:52:57,410
But he basically blasts music.

2072
01:52:57,710 --> 01:52:59,330
I can hear the vibrations.

2073
01:53:00,310 --> 01:53:01,950
And the music.

2074
01:53:02,510 --> 01:53:03,330
From next door.

2075
01:53:08,190 --> 01:53:10,210
I think I'm the problem.

2076
01:53:11,010 --> 01:53:13,150
I think I'm the problem.

2077
01:53:14,650 --> 01:53:16,750
Oh shit, I've been lagging this entire...

2078
01:53:16,750 --> 01:53:19,530
I'm sorry, I didn't realize I've been lagging this entire

2079
01:53:24,360 --> 01:53:24,860
time.

2080
01:53:25,200 --> 01:53:25,540
Okay.

2081
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:33,520
I didn't know.

2082
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:37,260
Okay, that's medium.

2083
01:53:43,150 --> 01:53:43,800
Let's see.

2084
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:46,280
I can't tell.

2085
01:53:46,700 --> 01:53:47,300
Am I better?

2086
01:53:50,650 --> 01:53:51,910
Am I better now?

2087
01:53:51,970 --> 01:53:52,690
I can't tell.

2088
01:53:52,690 --> 01:53:52,910
Oh.

2089
01:53:56,860 --> 01:53:59,380
The door that works in darkness.

2090
01:53:59,620 --> 01:54:00,780
That just looks like lipstick.

2091
01:54:01,180 --> 01:54:02,020
I just...

2092
01:54:02,020 --> 01:54:03,640
That just looks like lipstick.

2093
01:54:08,730 --> 01:54:10,390
Oh, this looks like safe.

2094
01:54:15,500 --> 01:54:17,020
This looks a little safe.

2095
01:54:19,200 --> 01:54:21,020
Oh, keep PC fun.

2096
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:23,080
This looks like...

2097
01:54:23,080 --> 01:54:24,020
Thank you for the super chat.

2098
01:54:24,160 --> 01:54:26,280
Maybe I should change something?

2099
01:54:28,840 --> 01:54:29,300
Alright.

2100
01:54:29,680 --> 01:54:29,880
Good.

2101
01:54:31,500 --> 01:54:32,460
I don't know.

2102
01:54:33,340 --> 01:54:34,340
Oh, maybe it's this.

2103
01:54:37,860 --> 01:54:39,100
I don't know.

2104
01:54:39,320 --> 01:54:40,440
Do we get rid of ray tracing?

2105
01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:41,480
Is it ray tracing?

2106
01:54:44,500 --> 01:54:45,720
What do we get rid of?

2107
01:54:46,080 --> 01:54:47,960
Wukong literally fucked up my PC.

2108
01:54:53,480 --> 01:54:53,940
Wukong...

2109
01:54:53,940 --> 01:54:57,020
Wukong literally fucked up my PC and it's never been the same.

2110
01:54:57,120 --> 01:54:59,720
It actually never has been the same since Wukong.

2111
01:55:04,040 --> 01:55:04,900
It's me.

2112
01:55:05,080 --> 01:55:06,220
I'm lagging.

2113
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:11,380
We don't need ray tracing, right?

2114
01:55:12,260 --> 01:55:12,860
Fuck it.

2115
01:55:12,900 --> 01:55:14,100
Let's turn that off.

2116
01:55:15,860 --> 01:55:17,420
Maybe that would be better.

2117
01:55:17,420 --> 01:55:17,680
Alright.

2118
01:55:22,180 --> 01:55:22,860
Yeah.

2119
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:26,280
Wukong actually fucked me up.

2120
01:55:31,220 --> 01:55:32,120
Still a little bit.

2121
01:55:32,260 --> 01:55:32,560
Fuck it.

2122
01:55:37,620 --> 01:55:40,420
Yeah, the monkey actually messed me up.

2123
01:55:41,540 --> 01:55:42,180
That was off.

2124
01:55:42,740 --> 01:55:44,160
I don't want to play in 60 frames.

2125
01:55:45,040 --> 01:55:47,280
I'll die mentally.

2126
01:55:49,740 --> 01:55:50,560
No.

2127
01:55:51,880 --> 01:55:55,580
I don't want to play 60 frames, guys.

2128
01:55:55,820 --> 01:55:57,080
I'll cry.

2129
01:55:58,360 --> 01:56:01,580
My eyes can't see past 60 frames no more.

2130
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:04,880
My eyes can't see under 100 frames.

2131
01:56:09,370 --> 01:56:12,690
Why do you have mouth on your fucking feet?

2132
01:56:13,830 --> 01:56:14,650
Fucking

2133
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:30,420
feet!

2134
01:56:37,290 --> 01:56:38,430
Wait, is that it?

2135
01:56:38,730 --> 01:56:39,650
Is he a boss?

2136
01:56:42,190 --> 01:56:45,390
Guys, is this a boss fight or is this a normal enemy?

2137
01:56:56,780 --> 01:56:58,060
Oh, it's normal?

2138
01:57:03,300 --> 01:57:04,560
Alright, I'll leave.

2139
01:57:05,660 --> 01:57:07,200
I thought he was...

2140
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:08,820
Oh, what a waste of shotgun ammo.

2141
01:57:09,720 --> 01:57:11,940
I thought it was a boss fight.

2142
01:57:15,160 --> 01:57:15,780
Wow.

2143
01:57:16,380 --> 01:57:19,460
I thought it was a boss fight!

2144
01:57:20,980 --> 01:57:22,220
I'm sad.

2145
01:57:23,320 --> 01:57:25,320
I'm so sad.

2146
01:57:28,520 --> 01:57:31,380
I legitimately thought it was a boss fight.

2147
01:57:31,560 --> 01:57:32,500
I was like, I'm ready.

2148
01:57:32,600 --> 01:57:34,700
I'm so fucking ready to get this guy.

2149
01:57:35,020 --> 01:57:36,060
I'm gonna get ya.

2150
01:57:36,500 --> 01:57:37,840
I'm gonna get ya.

2151
01:57:40,200 --> 01:57:41,440
Oh my god.

2152
01:57:41,580 --> 01:57:41,700
Oh my god, guys.

2153
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:42,840
I can't believe my game crashed.

2154
01:57:43,080 --> 01:57:48,920
I was so ready.

2155
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:51,640
God damn it.

2156
01:57:52,100 --> 01:57:53,680
I was so ready too.

2157
01:57:55,400 --> 01:57:56,880
Is there any extra loot in here?

2158
01:57:58,420 --> 01:58:00,440
I haven't found any loot at all.

2159
01:58:02,660 --> 01:58:04,540
And he got my belt bullets.

2160
01:58:06,100 --> 01:58:06,580
Fucking...

2161
01:58:06,580 --> 01:58:09,880
That fucking whore with the mouth on his feet.

2162
01:58:11,980 --> 01:58:13,200
That's the same thing.

2163
01:58:17,850 --> 01:58:19,010
I don't know.

2164
01:58:19,130 --> 01:58:19,970
He looked...

2165
01:58:19,970 --> 01:58:22,310
He looked so bossy.

2166
01:58:25,050 --> 01:58:26,930
He looked like he knew what...

2167
01:58:26,930 --> 01:58:28,330
He looked like he was gonna get me.

2168
01:58:28,510 --> 01:58:29,110
I don't know.

2169
01:58:29,570 --> 01:58:31,110
I legitimately thought he was gonna get me.

2170
01:58:33,010 --> 01:58:34,290
Does the game look more shit?

2171
01:58:34,370 --> 01:58:34,950
I can't tell.

2172
01:58:34,950 --> 01:58:36,050
I feel like it looks the same.

2173
01:58:36,250 --> 01:58:38,490
I feel like you guys would know if it looks worse.

2174
01:58:38,670 --> 01:58:41,770
Because I lowered... I changed the quality.

2175
01:58:46,580 --> 01:58:47,600
Game looks fine?

2176
01:58:47,780 --> 01:58:48,060
Good.

2177
01:58:48,180 --> 01:58:48,400
Okay.

2178
01:58:48,580 --> 01:58:49,720
I wasn't sure.

2179
01:58:54,080 --> 01:58:55,080
I wasn't sure.

2180
01:58:55,160 --> 01:58:56,940
Because to me, the game looks the same.

2181
01:59:00,310 --> 01:59:02,510
But I did lower the quality of stuff.

2182
01:59:08,860 --> 01:59:09,580
It's dark.

2183
01:59:09,700 --> 01:59:10,180
True!

2184
01:59:11,440 --> 01:59:12,720
It's a dark game.

2185
01:59:12,720 --> 01:59:13,800
Why does it matter?

2186
01:59:14,020 --> 01:59:14,720
So true.

2187
01:59:15,100 --> 01:59:16,020
You're so right.

2188
01:59:27,600 --> 01:59:30,660
Oh, there she is.

2189
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:31,580
Who's that?

2190
01:59:32,740 --> 01:59:33,380
Oh, Laura?

2191
01:59:45,610 --> 01:59:46,370
Wait, no.

2192
01:59:46,450 --> 01:59:46,850
Not Laura.

2193
01:59:47,090 --> 01:59:48,070
You're the other girl.

2194
01:59:48,170 --> 01:59:49,230
The other crazy girl.

2195
01:59:49,470 --> 01:59:49,950
Angela.

2196
01:59:50,610 --> 01:59:51,650
It's been so long.

2197
01:59:51,810 --> 01:59:53,530
I don't remember... I forgot about her.

2198
01:59:54,150 --> 01:59:55,090
I forgot about her.

2199
01:59:55,610 --> 01:59:56,930
We're all depressed anyway.

2200
02:00:04,790 --> 02:00:06,970
I wonder what she sees in her Silent Hill.

2201
02:00:07,290 --> 02:00:08,890
How does she get past all this?

2202
02:00:08,930 --> 02:00:09,710
Where's your gun?

2203
02:00:10,370 --> 02:00:12,930
Am I the only Silent Hill where they're trying to kill me?

2204
02:00:16,930 --> 02:00:18,610
Am I the only one?

2205
02:00:18,730 --> 02:00:19,830
Where's your gun?

2206
02:00:32,900 --> 02:00:33,340
Huh?

2207
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:46,440
Why?

2208
02:00:46,660 --> 02:00:47,480
What did you do?

2209
02:00:50,380 --> 02:00:51,060
Yeah.

2210
02:01:00,910 --> 02:01:02,550
You saw your mom?

2211
02:01:09,250 --> 02:01:11,070
I just met you, man.

2212
02:01:14,820 --> 02:01:16,660
I don't know who you are.

2213
02:01:17,560 --> 02:01:18,540
That's too fast.

2214
02:01:28,330 --> 02:01:30,150
Don't you want company?

2215
02:01:30,510 --> 02:01:31,090
I mean...

2216
02:01:31,970 --> 02:01:32,750
We could get closer.

2217
02:01:33,410 --> 02:01:34,190
Not too close.

2218
02:01:34,250 --> 02:01:34,910
It's still November.

2219
02:01:35,290 --> 02:01:36,170
It's still November.

2220
02:01:45,270 --> 02:01:47,090
Dark and scary Silent Hill.

2221
02:01:55,460 --> 02:01:56,800
I lost Maria.

2222
02:01:57,560 --> 02:01:58,280
Thank God.

2223
02:01:58,540 --> 02:01:59,780
My homie got my back.

2224
02:01:59,780 --> 02:02:01,940
He knew what month it is.

2225
02:02:23,570 --> 02:02:26,150
What do you see?

2226
02:02:29,670 --> 02:02:30,370
Huh?

2227
02:02:37,030 --> 02:02:38,870
Panda, welcome to Tomato Farm.

2228
02:02:38,950 --> 02:02:39,690
Welcome, welcome.

2229
02:02:39,910 --> 02:02:44,370
Are you doing that month too?

2230
02:02:44,470 --> 02:02:45,990
I shouldn't joke about that.

2231
02:02:46,330 --> 02:02:47,130
I'm sorry.

2232
02:02:50,450 --> 02:02:52,510
Are you doing the challenge?

2233
02:02:53,450 --> 02:02:54,350
I'm sorry.

2234
02:02:56,930 --> 02:02:58,170
When did she drop?

2235
02:03:03,480 --> 02:03:04,680
What is that?

2236
02:03:14,170 --> 02:03:15,390
Oh, it's a key.

2237
02:03:16,350 --> 02:03:18,330
My patient buried it here.

2238
02:03:18,530 --> 02:03:19,810
I knew, but did nothing.

2239
02:03:20,730 --> 02:03:21,670
It made me uneasy.

2240
02:03:21,750 --> 02:03:23,950
I think she saw something from Silent Hill.

2241
02:03:25,270 --> 02:03:26,150
I think.

2242
02:03:26,390 --> 02:03:27,590
That's why she's freaking out.

2243
02:03:29,110 --> 02:03:30,650
I wasn't looking for the truth.

2244
02:03:30,750 --> 02:03:31,590
I was looking for tranquility.

2245
02:03:32,590 --> 02:03:33,690
I also saw that thing.

2246
02:03:34,210 --> 02:03:36,570
I fled, but the old society was sealed.

2247
02:03:37,190 --> 02:03:38,970
No one dares to approach that place.

2248
02:03:39,450 --> 02:03:41,170
Now, I offer you the key.

2249
02:03:41,770 --> 02:03:45,370
If you still do not wish to stop, James, I pray to the Lord to have mercy.

2250
02:03:45,370 --> 02:03:46,910
Have mercy on your eternal soul.

2251
02:03:47,690 --> 02:03:48,690
I wonder what she saw.

2252
02:03:50,530 --> 02:03:53,130
I wonder why she was freaked out too.

2253
02:03:54,070 --> 02:03:56,650
She didn't want me to get near her.

2254
02:03:57,310 --> 02:03:59,730
What the fuck is your Silent Hill, man?

2255
02:04:00,570 --> 02:04:01,590
I wanna know.

2256
02:04:04,050 --> 02:04:05,710
Oh, is it really fucked up?

2257
02:04:05,910 --> 02:04:07,370
Is your Silent Hill incredibly...

2258
02:04:07,950 --> 02:04:09,230
Oh my God.

2259
02:04:09,290 --> 02:04:10,770
I should not have said that.

2260
02:04:10,870 --> 02:04:11,550
I'm sorry.

2261
02:04:11,670 --> 02:04:13,970
I did not know what your Silent Hill was.

2262
02:04:15,370 --> 02:04:16,850
Guys, I didn't know.

2263
02:04:17,010 --> 02:04:17,970
I still don't know.

2264
02:04:18,350 --> 02:04:20,730
I can assume it's something really bad now.

2265
02:04:21,270 --> 02:04:26,590
I can assume it's something really, really bad now.

2266
02:04:28,350 --> 02:04:30,210
Guys, I don't know.

2267
02:04:30,370 --> 02:04:33,170
I don't know what her Silent Hill is, guys.

2268
02:04:33,290 --> 02:04:35,230
I still don't know.

2269
02:04:35,530 --> 02:04:37,350
I don't know her history.

2270
02:04:44,670 --> 02:04:46,310
Wait, where am I supposed to go?

2271
02:04:47,710 --> 02:04:50,230
Oh, I'm supposed to go to the historical society.

2272
02:04:50,230 --> 02:04:50,550
Okay.

2273
02:04:54,210 --> 02:04:54,770
Okay.

2274
02:04:55,690 --> 02:04:56,630
It was a word?

2275
02:04:57,450 --> 02:04:58,310
I don't know then.

2276
02:05:02,720 --> 02:05:03,740
I don't know what she said.

2277
02:05:05,420 --> 02:05:06,260
What did I say?

2278
02:05:07,160 --> 02:05:08,040
I don't...

2279
02:05:08,040 --> 02:05:09,780
What did I say?

2280
02:05:10,820 --> 02:05:12,060
What did I do?

2281
02:05:12,140 --> 02:05:12,940
I don't know.

2282
02:05:13,320 --> 02:05:16,920
I've never played Silent Hill 2 before.

2283
02:05:17,320 --> 02:05:18,780
I don't know.

2284
02:05:18,980 --> 02:05:20,000
I don't know the story.

2285
02:05:20,140 --> 02:05:21,220
I just know about the fear.

2286
02:05:21,220 --> 02:05:24,220
I just know that I'm in the same fucking world.

2287
02:05:24,440 --> 02:05:25,660
I don't know the story.

2288
02:05:26,920 --> 02:05:29,400
You can't cancel ignorance.

2289
02:05:29,940 --> 02:05:32,240
If I've never played Silent Hill before.

2290
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:36,100
Thank you for the super chat.

2291
02:05:36,240 --> 02:05:37,160
Thank you.

2292
02:05:40,720 --> 02:05:41,340
Anything?

2293
02:05:47,060 --> 02:05:48,600
Is there anything?

2294
02:05:48,600 --> 02:05:50,720
What did I say?

2295
02:05:50,840 --> 02:05:53,000
I don't even know what he said.

2296
02:05:53,480 --> 02:05:55,540
I thought she just saw something.

2297
02:05:55,700 --> 02:05:57,460
I thought it was just Silent Hill related.

2298
02:05:59,280 --> 02:05:59,740
No.

2299
02:06:00,560 --> 02:06:03,080
No, I'm rewinding my head.

2300
02:06:03,280 --> 02:06:04,260
What did he say?

2301
02:06:05,200 --> 02:06:06,520
What's the hint?

2302
02:06:10,790 --> 02:06:12,190
Oh, you'll find out.

2303
02:06:12,250 --> 02:06:13,170
Oh, no.

2304
02:06:16,450 --> 02:06:17,570
Oh, no.

2305
02:06:17,570 --> 02:06:17,730
Oh.

2306
02:06:19,650 --> 02:06:20,870
Hello, girl.

2307
02:06:22,690 --> 02:06:23,410
Laura?

2308
02:06:23,710 --> 02:06:24,810
What did Laura do to her?

2309
02:06:27,830 --> 02:06:29,030
Jesus Christ.

2310
02:06:29,110 --> 02:06:30,230
Am I not there yet?

2311
02:06:38,820 --> 02:06:40,140
Area by the end?

2312
02:06:40,260 --> 02:06:41,660
There's like nothing here.

2313
02:06:50,950 --> 02:06:53,910
God, this area fucking sucks.

2314
02:06:56,210 --> 02:06:57,790
No loot anywhere.

2315
02:07:07,600 --> 02:07:07,900
Here?

2316
02:07:12,360 --> 02:07:13,300
Oh, there is.

2317
02:07:13,380 --> 02:07:13,820
Thank God.

2318
02:07:15,320 --> 02:07:16,540
Oh, thank God.

2319
02:07:16,700 --> 02:07:17,280
Finally.

2320
02:07:19,100 --> 02:07:20,640
Yeah, it's so dark.

2321
02:07:20,780 --> 02:07:22,280
So I don't know where the loot is.

2322
02:07:26,930 --> 02:07:27,870
God, okay.

2323
02:07:28,030 --> 02:07:29,670
I'm still sad that I wasted.

2324
02:07:30,070 --> 02:07:33,330
I'm still so sad I wasted like 200 fucking...

2325
02:07:33,330 --> 02:07:37,290
I thought it was a boss fight.

2326
02:07:37,470 --> 02:07:40,730
I didn't know it was a regular fucking fight.

2327
02:07:42,070 --> 02:07:44,770
It wasn't even a boss fight.

2328
02:07:48,210 --> 02:07:50,350
It just looked so bossable.

2329
02:07:51,410 --> 02:07:52,050
Alright.

2330
02:07:52,230 --> 02:07:53,810
While I save, I'm gonna use the bathroom.

2331
02:07:53,930 --> 02:07:54,810
I'll be right back, guys.

2332
02:09:00,240 --> 02:09:01,180
I'm back.

2333
02:09:01,380 --> 02:09:03,060
Sorry, I'm hydrating a lot.

2334
02:09:03,540 --> 02:09:05,960
Because I've been coughing a lot.

2335
02:09:06,680 --> 02:09:07,320
So...

2336
02:09:07,320 --> 02:09:08,740
Let me save again.

2337
02:09:09,480 --> 02:09:10,040
Alright.

2338
02:09:13,250 --> 02:09:15,810
Guys, I think I finally hit 50% of the game.

2339
02:09:16,490 --> 02:09:18,130
It only took 5 parts.

2340
02:09:19,990 --> 02:09:23,230
I think at this rate, we can finish the game by 2026, guys.

2341
02:09:24,890 --> 02:09:26,290
At this rate.

2342
02:09:27,090 --> 02:09:27,930
I think...

2343
02:09:35,450 --> 02:09:37,590
I think we can do it.

2344
02:09:38,990 --> 02:09:40,910
Guys, don't say that.

2345
02:09:40,910 --> 02:09:46,190
Don't say almost, but don't say that, please.

2346
02:09:47,590 --> 02:09:50,070
That does not bring me joy.

2347
02:09:52,050 --> 02:09:54,270
The new clock?

2348
02:09:56,910 --> 02:09:58,210
What do you mean 40%?

2349
02:09:58,730 --> 02:09:59,090
No.

2350
02:09:59,530 --> 02:10:00,010
No.

2351
02:10:00,190 --> 02:10:01,250
Take that back.

2352
02:10:01,790 --> 02:10:02,010
No.

2353
02:10:02,450 --> 02:10:04,590
I'd rather you just lie to me.

2354
02:10:05,050 --> 02:10:05,570
I...

2355
02:10:08,610 --> 02:10:09,310
I...

2356
02:10:09,310 --> 02:10:12,370
I'd rather you just lie to me.

2357
02:10:12,510 --> 02:10:13,610
What do you mean?

2358
02:10:24,460 --> 02:10:26,620
The waterfront landscape.

2359
02:10:28,440 --> 02:10:31,540
Okay, I need to find that painting, I guess.

2360
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:36,080
No, don't say that.

2361
02:10:39,120 --> 02:10:40,240
God, okay.

2362
02:10:40,240 --> 02:10:40,500
Okay.

2363
02:10:43,060 --> 02:10:44,840
I'm a speed reader.

2364
02:10:46,940 --> 02:10:50,840
Silent Hill Historical Society Founders.

2365
02:10:57,690 --> 02:10:58,690
Okay.

2366
02:11:06,960 --> 02:11:08,740
Do I have to go this way?

2367
02:11:09,100 --> 02:11:10,300
Yeah, it's this way.

2368
02:11:12,980 --> 02:11:14,360
Caven Hospital.

2369
02:11:18,330 --> 02:11:20,450
Someone's shack, really?

2370
02:11:21,950 --> 02:11:22,790
Coal mine.

2371
02:11:22,910 --> 02:11:28,930
Oh, that's the part where like Silent Hill became extra foggy because of the coal mines.

2372
02:11:30,170 --> 02:11:31,750
Into the pit we go.

2373
02:11:36,660 --> 02:11:39,980
Into the dark, dark black mold pit.

2374
02:11:41,280 --> 02:11:42,700
Love black mold.

2375
02:11:42,900 --> 02:11:43,660
Let's go.

2376
02:11:44,880 --> 02:11:47,360
How fucking deep is this pit?

2377
02:11:47,480 --> 02:11:48,440
Oh my god.

2378
02:11:48,500 --> 02:11:50,580
If you trip and fall, you GG's.

2379
02:11:54,340 --> 02:11:55,340
I'm still going down.

2380
02:11:57,960 --> 02:11:59,580
Still going down.

2381
02:12:03,060 --> 02:12:04,860
Am I going to the mine shaft?

2382
02:12:10,320 --> 02:12:14,160
Oh, by the time I finish Silent Hill 2, Silent Hill 3 remaster comes out?

2383
02:12:14,580 --> 02:12:14,780
Yeah.

2384
02:12:16,560 --> 02:12:18,560
Thank you for the super chat.

2385
02:12:18,840 --> 02:12:20,060
Thank you, thank you.

2386
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:23,880
You know what?

2387
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:25,460
That makes sense.

2388
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:30,260
Into the mines we go.

2389
02:12:34,520 --> 02:12:36,980
Holy fuck, I did it.

2390
02:12:38,660 --> 02:12:39,340
Alright.

2391
02:12:40,260 --> 02:12:42,380
I get an achievement for that?

2392
02:12:43,360 --> 02:12:45,060
For the bare minimum?

2393
02:12:45,480 --> 02:12:46,200
What?

2394
02:12:47,140 --> 02:12:49,280
Why do you get a fucking achievement?

2395
02:12:59,410 --> 02:13:00,930
Oh my god, I did it.

2396
02:13:01,010 --> 02:13:03,170
I did it, guys.

2397
02:13:03,330 --> 02:13:05,490
I fucking went down the staircase.

2398
02:13:07,110 --> 02:13:09,190
Wow, that was... what a thrilling moment.

2399
02:13:09,530 --> 02:13:10,690
I think this is like...

2400
02:13:10,690 --> 02:13:12,710
I have a god achievement in this game.

2401
02:13:12,830 --> 02:13:13,930
This is the first one.

2402
02:13:21,560 --> 02:13:22,820
What was that?

2403
02:13:25,960 --> 02:13:27,720
Oh, it's you again.

2404
02:13:27,880 --> 02:13:29,180
I haven't seen you in so long.

2405
02:13:30,120 --> 02:13:31,600
Oh my god.

2406
02:13:31,660 --> 02:13:32,160
Okay.

2407
02:13:33,400 --> 02:13:35,400
Now I remember why I fucking hated you.

2408
02:13:39,020 --> 02:13:39,940
Where is he?

2409
02:13:42,220 --> 02:13:43,300
Why are you so mad?

2410
02:13:46,680 --> 02:13:48,640
Welcome to my favorite part of the game.

2411
02:13:48,720 --> 02:13:49,080
A.K.A.

2412
02:13:49,140 --> 02:13:51,560
the scariest and longest part of the OG.

2413
02:13:52,060 --> 02:13:52,960
The leg...

2414
02:13:55,900 --> 02:13:57,460
Why is it so dark?

2415
02:13:59,200 --> 02:13:59,680
Aww.

2416
02:14:01,180 --> 02:14:02,580
Oh, you know why, Doki.

2417
02:14:02,740 --> 02:14:04,640
You know goddamn why it's so dark.

2418
02:14:04,860 --> 02:14:07,180
Thank you for the super chat, D-Dragon.

2419
02:14:07,380 --> 02:14:08,540
Thank you, thank you.

2420
02:14:08,540 --> 02:14:12,480
I can't see anything.

2421
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:14,360
I can't see anything.

2422
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:17,680
Thank you for the gods.

2423
02:14:18,280 --> 02:14:19,740
Death by screwing?

2424
02:14:29,140 --> 02:14:31,200
Why is it so dark?

2425
02:14:31,700 --> 02:14:33,520
How can it get darker?

2426
02:14:34,600 --> 02:14:36,500
How can this game get darker?

2427
02:14:37,520 --> 02:14:38,320
Like...

2428
02:14:38,320 --> 02:14:38,740
How?

2429
02:14:39,700 --> 02:14:42,660
Oh, there's that fucking pit from earlier.

2430
02:14:47,080 --> 02:14:48,700
Alright, jump into the hole.

2431
02:14:49,040 --> 02:14:50,160
Do a flip.

2432
02:14:50,820 --> 02:14:51,560
Do a- Do it!

2433
02:14:52,080 --> 02:14:52,680
Do a flip!

2434
02:14:59,060 --> 02:15:01,440
What's the- Yeah, fuck it.

2435
02:15:04,560 --> 02:15:06,740
Just jump down there, James.

2436
02:15:06,860 --> 02:15:08,700
What's the worst that could happen?

2437
02:15:12,240 --> 02:15:14,360
I should not have survived the pit.

2438
02:15:22,330 --> 02:15:24,470
Yeah, I should not have survived this pit.

2439
02:15:25,310 --> 02:15:25,510
Yeah.

2440
02:15:27,310 --> 02:15:30,730
How the fuck did I survive the fucking pit?

2441
02:15:31,190 --> 02:15:31,930
In this block?

2442
02:15:32,250 --> 02:15:32,570
Wait.

2443
02:15:35,610 --> 02:15:36,870
Which way do I go?

2444
02:15:37,070 --> 02:15:38,250
There's so many holes.

2445
02:15:46,550 --> 02:15:48,170
Which one's the right hole?

2446
02:15:49,710 --> 02:15:50,670
Oh, not these.

2447
02:15:50,790 --> 02:15:51,830
Oh, none of these were.

2448
02:15:55,530 --> 02:15:57,230
Oh, none of them were.

2449
02:15:57,370 --> 02:15:58,570
This was the right hole.

2450
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:05,040
Ah.

2451
02:16:07,060 --> 02:16:08,100
Ah.

2452
02:16:11,280 --> 02:16:11,800
Ah.

2453
02:16:12,680 --> 02:16:14,000
Water time.

2454
02:16:14,520 --> 02:16:15,700
Water time.

2455
02:16:16,600 --> 02:16:17,700
Water time.

2456
02:16:18,980 --> 02:16:21,880
What the fucking- Oh, I had a feeling.

2457
02:16:23,320 --> 02:16:25,140
Oh, there you go.

2458
02:16:25,660 --> 02:16:26,460
There we go.

2459
02:16:26,680 --> 02:16:29,240
There you go.

2460
02:16:29,760 --> 02:16:30,800
There you go.

2461
02:16:30,800 --> 02:16:32,000
Full of water time.

2462
02:16:32,840 --> 02:16:34,720
Water time.

2463
02:16:35,140 --> 02:16:37,340
Full of water time.

2464
02:16:40,220 --> 02:16:40,860
Water!

2465
02:16:42,360 --> 02:16:43,800
Why don't you have a map?

2466
02:16:49,780 --> 02:16:50,640
What's this?

2467
02:16:50,780 --> 02:16:52,320
Spiral writing key.

2468
02:17:15,560 --> 02:17:16,760
What?

2469
02:17:17,960 --> 02:17:18,760
What?

2470
02:17:19,720 --> 02:17:20,380
What?

2471
02:17:21,520 --> 02:17:23,860
I'm confused!

2472
02:17:23,860 --> 02:17:25,460
Confusion!

2473
02:17:26,640 --> 02:17:27,860
Confusion!

2474
02:17:34,930 --> 02:17:36,330
Confused!

2475
02:17:36,850 --> 02:17:40,190
Naked, confused, and afraid!

2476
02:18:04,960 --> 02:18:07,560
Oh my god!

2477
02:18:07,560 --> 02:18:10,840
Why does- What do the numbers mean?

2478
02:18:29,560 --> 02:18:32,000
I'm so confused!

2479
02:18:58,150 --> 02:18:59,890
Oh my god.

2480
02:19:03,310 --> 02:19:04,230
Here we go.

2481
02:19:05,290 --> 02:19:05,870
Just jump.

2482
02:19:06,230 --> 02:19:08,090
Just jump, James.

2483
02:19:09,350 --> 02:19:11,350
Just jump!

2484
02:19:17,570 --> 02:19:19,130
Just jump.

2485
02:19:19,130 --> 02:19:20,450
I don't know.

2486
02:19:21,870 --> 02:19:22,590
Just jump.

2487
02:19:22,730 --> 02:19:24,550
If we die, we die.

2488
02:19:32,420 --> 02:19:33,220
Oh.

2489
02:19:33,720 --> 02:19:35,760
Where the fuck are we now?

2490
02:19:37,360 --> 02:19:38,460
Where are we?

2491
02:19:45,080 --> 02:19:47,180
I was so confused.

2492
02:19:47,940 --> 02:19:48,520
Oh.

2493
02:19:49,040 --> 02:19:49,980
What the fuck?

2494
02:19:53,790 --> 02:19:55,570
The fuck is that?

2495
02:19:56,810 --> 02:19:57,850
Is that me?

2496
02:20:11,720 --> 02:20:12,320
Eddie?

2497
02:20:13,100 --> 02:20:13,420
Eddie?

2498
02:20:14,120 --> 02:20:15,800
Did you get that gun, Eddie?

2499
02:20:23,140 --> 02:20:24,840
Who is this guy?

2500
02:20:29,260 --> 02:20:30,260
Self-defense?

2501
02:20:30,700 --> 02:20:32,580
You can tell me if it's self-defense, Eddie.

2502
02:20:35,100 --> 02:20:35,540
Yeah.

2503
02:20:40,100 --> 02:20:42,000
How did he make you do it, Eddie?

2504
02:20:55,300 --> 02:20:57,260
Why is he sitting down, Eddie?

2505
02:21:05,460 --> 02:21:05,880
What?

2506
02:21:07,340 --> 02:21:08,640
Eddie, he's sitting down.

2507
02:21:09,080 --> 02:21:10,140
He looked at you?

2508
02:21:11,600 --> 02:21:12,020
Yeah.

2509
02:21:16,200 --> 02:21:17,180
Oh, you're right.

2510
02:21:17,360 --> 02:21:17,680
Yeah.

2511
02:21:18,500 --> 02:21:19,160
You know what, Eddie?

2512
02:21:20,800 --> 02:21:22,400
You're clearly in the right.

2513
02:21:22,720 --> 02:21:25,780
I mean, you're holding a gun right now, so I hope I don't piss you off.

2514
02:21:25,820 --> 02:21:27,660
So I'm gonna agree with everything you're saying.

2515
02:21:29,800 --> 02:21:30,220
Hmm.

2516
02:21:37,380 --> 02:21:40,180
James, you fucking killed so- Oh, to be fair, they had no eyes.

2517
02:21:43,800 --> 02:21:46,160
They didn't have eyes, so I could kill people.

2518
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:05,700
Hmm.

2519
02:22:09,760 --> 02:22:10,840
Hmm.

2520
02:22:18,060 --> 02:22:19,140
Yeah.

2521
02:22:29,180 --> 02:22:32,300
He was dead when he got here.

2522
02:22:37,830 --> 02:22:40,930
But we're in our own Silent Hills.

2523
02:22:42,230 --> 02:22:44,350
Hey, that doesn't make sense.

2524
02:22:46,330 --> 02:22:50,230
If we both see this guy...

2525
02:22:50,230 --> 02:22:51,890
I thought we're in our...

2526
02:22:54,420 --> 02:22:56,160
That doesn't make sense.

2527
02:22:56,460 --> 02:22:59,660
Why do we both see him if we're both in different Silent Hills?

2528
02:23:04,800 --> 02:23:07,420
Yeah, but that blood looks fresh, though.

2529
02:23:10,860 --> 02:23:12,120
That's the thing.

2530
02:23:14,060 --> 02:23:17,860
Like, old blood would not be that red.

2531
02:23:23,620 --> 02:23:27,120
They still haven't found him since he had the cabinet key.

2532
02:23:27,740 --> 02:23:34,200
We should assume one of the prisoners got his hands on it.

2533
02:23:34,760 --> 02:23:39,340
Get the spare from the witness checkpoint and secure the rifle before it falls into the wrong hands.

2534
02:23:39,460 --> 02:23:39,820
Okay.

2535
02:23:40,540 --> 02:23:42,180
Oh, we get to have a rifle now!

2536
02:23:46,140 --> 02:23:47,180
Alright, save.

2537
02:23:49,740 --> 02:23:52,220
Guys, how- Who knows that?

2538
02:23:53,280 --> 02:23:55,160
Oh, there's the rifle ammo.

2539
02:24:01,880 --> 02:24:03,040
Go this way?

2540
02:24:04,600 --> 02:24:05,080
Huh.

2541
02:24:06,980 --> 02:24:08,240
Where do I go?

2542
02:24:10,660 --> 02:24:12,280
I'll go here first.

2543
02:24:18,020 --> 02:24:18,820
Did you get the map?

2544
02:24:18,920 --> 02:24:19,620
I did not.

2545
02:24:19,700 --> 02:24:21,140
I have no idea where the-

2546
02:24:25,760 --> 02:24:27,960
I have no idea where the map is.

2547
02:24:31,640 --> 02:24:32,520
Where's the map?

2548
02:24:43,360 --> 02:24:49,680
Yeah, I'm not scared of, like, that particular guy, because that's, like, one of the weakest guys.

2549
02:24:53,900 --> 02:24:55,880
The prisoners do not feel remorse.

2550
02:24:56,100 --> 02:24:58,760
In fact, they do not feel themselves, to be simple at all.

2551
02:24:59,380 --> 02:25:03,620
Even the simplest of them will try to shield themselves from the Lord's gaze with both little words they know.

2552
02:25:04,160 --> 02:25:07,200
And so they dream blissfully, the sinners that they are.

2553
02:25:07,760 --> 02:25:13,120
But no matter how foul and loathsome one's existence may be, human nature abides.

2554
02:25:13,520 --> 02:25:13,940
Okay.

2555
02:25:16,080 --> 02:25:20,640
So they're trying to say that prisoners are not re- Whoa.

2556
02:25:21,320 --> 02:25:21,820
Whoa.

2557
02:25:22,500 --> 02:25:23,100
Whoa!

2558
02:25:27,080 --> 02:25:28,900
Why- Do you see that?

2559
02:25:30,620 --> 02:25:33,660
Do you see a little- a little, like, whoa.

2560
02:25:34,720 --> 02:25:36,460
Oh, James.

2561
02:25:36,580 --> 02:25:37,800
You little freak.

2562
02:25:37,800 --> 02:25:38,920
Man.

2563
02:25:42,360 --> 02:25:44,040
It's still November.

2564
02:25:44,320 --> 02:25:45,660
Look away.

2565
02:25:47,520 --> 02:25:49,800
What I'm saying is...

2566
02:25:50,380 --> 02:25:52,680
James is a little freaky.

2567
02:25:55,640 --> 02:25:56,840
Did it say there's a map?

2568
02:25:57,080 --> 02:25:58,320
Oh, it's- Is it this?

2569
02:25:58,660 --> 02:25:59,500
Oh, there it is.

2570
02:26:01,360 --> 02:26:02,080
Okay.

2571
02:26:04,240 --> 02:26:05,740
Let me save again.

2572
02:26:09,840 --> 02:26:15,860
I like how, like, the little details on- Like, James.

2573
02:26:16,420 --> 02:26:17,840
Oh, James.

2574
02:26:18,900 --> 02:26:20,240
You're so silly.

2575
02:26:22,380 --> 02:26:23,260
Whoa!

2576
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:25,880
Alright.

2577
02:26:26,760 --> 02:26:27,460
Oh, goodbye.

2578
02:26:28,740 --> 02:26:29,620
Oh,

2579
02:26:40,570 --> 02:26:41,630
I can open it.

2580
02:26:41,710 --> 02:26:42,010
Okay.

2581
02:26:43,530 --> 02:26:45,250
Wait, is it timed?

2582
02:26:46,910 --> 02:26:47,830
Not fair.

2583
02:26:53,330 --> 02:26:54,690
It's not fair.

2584
02:26:55,010 --> 02:26:56,170
Why is it timed?

2585
02:27:01,220 --> 02:27:02,440
How are they worse?

2586
02:27:10,530 --> 02:27:11,950
I don't understand.

2587
02:27:12,110 --> 02:27:12,950
Why is it timed?

2588
02:27:13,870 --> 02:27:15,090
Why is this timed?

2589
02:27:15,570 --> 02:27:16,770
Why is this timed?

2590
02:27:16,870 --> 02:27:18,910
I don't understand why they do that.

2591
02:27:23,960 --> 02:27:26,980
Oh, that's why it's timed.

2592
02:27:27,880 --> 02:27:28,400
Oh.

2593
02:27:28,400 --> 02:27:28,980
Oh.

2594
02:27:32,940 --> 02:27:36,620
And we do this, and then we run to the other side.

2595
02:27:41,960 --> 02:27:42,700
Oh, no.

2596
02:27:42,820 --> 02:27:43,060
Wait.

2597
02:27:43,200 --> 02:27:44,180
That doesn't make sense.

2598
02:27:48,490 --> 02:27:49,770
That doesn't make sense.

2599
02:27:49,990 --> 02:27:50,830
Why are you timed?

2600
02:27:53,330 --> 02:27:56,170
I don't understand why you timed it like that.

2601
02:27:56,830 --> 02:27:57,570
That's evil.

2602
02:28:02,350 --> 02:28:03,430
That's so evil.

2603
02:28:03,630 --> 02:28:04,490
I don't like that.

2604
02:28:18,580 --> 02:28:19,220
Okay.

2605
02:28:20,680 --> 02:28:22,220
I don't like that.

2606
02:28:22,260 --> 02:28:22,920
I don't like that.

2607
02:28:23,240 --> 02:28:24,600
I don't like that.

2608
02:28:24,600 --> 02:28:28,640
I don't like that it's timed.

2609
02:28:34,860 --> 02:28:36,520
That's so evil.

2610
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:38,920
That is actually so evil.

2611
02:28:39,840 --> 02:28:41,800
Why did they do this?

2612
02:28:59,530 --> 02:29:00,230
Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.

2613
02:29:04,950 --> 02:29:05,650
Hate.

2614
02:29:07,570 --> 02:29:09,430
This has to be cleaned up by Tuesday.

2615
02:29:09,570 --> 02:29:11,450
Make sure you get the cons to do it then.

2616
02:29:12,710 --> 02:29:13,050
Hate.

2617
02:29:15,410 --> 02:29:16,930
So much hate.

2618
02:29:20,280 --> 02:29:21,900
Can I open this?

2619
02:29:24,940 --> 02:29:25,640
Anger.

2620
02:29:28,460 --> 02:29:30,180
Aw, that's so annoying.

2621
02:29:30,180 --> 02:29:30,500
That's so annoying.

2622
02:29:31,560 --> 02:29:35,220
I mean, I don't need it, but like...

2623
02:29:35,220 --> 02:29:35,900
I'm scared.

2624
02:29:40,580 --> 02:29:41,380
I'm scared.

2625
02:29:45,770 --> 02:29:46,790
I'm scared.

2626
02:29:48,370 --> 02:29:49,610
Good point.

2627
02:29:49,790 --> 02:29:51,250
Aren't those good points to have?

2628
02:30:00,530 --> 02:30:01,870
Aw, really?

2629
02:30:01,870 --> 02:30:01,950
Really?

2630
02:30:08,740 --> 02:30:09,300
Okay.

2631
02:30:14,900 --> 02:30:16,880
Oh, fuck.

2632
02:30:17,140 --> 02:30:17,420
Okay.

2633
02:30:17,980 --> 02:30:19,780
Actually, I don't think I like the prison.

2634
02:30:20,100 --> 02:30:21,580
I think...

2635
02:30:23,840 --> 02:30:24,520
prison...

2636
02:30:24,520 --> 02:30:25,380
What is that?

2637
02:30:25,500 --> 02:30:26,300
Prison's scary.

2638
02:30:32,360 --> 02:30:33,040
Alright.

2639
02:30:37,710 --> 02:30:38,070
Okay.

2640
02:30:38,070 --> 02:30:38,290
Okay.

2641
02:30:40,010 --> 02:30:41,070
God, I need more ammo.

2642
02:30:41,350 --> 02:30:41,890
I'm running out.

2643
02:30:41,990 --> 02:30:42,810
I'm starting to run out.

2644
02:30:42,990 --> 02:30:44,290
I'm starting to run out of ammo.

2645
02:30:45,650 --> 02:30:46,570
Prison bad.

2646
02:30:47,250 --> 02:30:48,230
Prison bad.

2647
02:30:49,330 --> 02:30:50,850
Prison scary and bad.

2648
02:30:53,470 --> 02:30:54,730
Did I check everything?

2649
02:30:56,130 --> 02:30:57,130
I think I did.

2650
02:31:03,290 --> 02:31:03,790
Fuck.

2651
02:31:03,870 --> 02:31:04,130
Okay.

2652
02:31:04,130 --> 02:31:04,190
Okay.

2653
02:31:09,030 --> 02:31:10,070
Who's there?

2654
02:31:10,890 --> 02:31:12,610
That's downstairs.

2655
02:31:14,680 --> 02:31:16,230
God damn it.

2656
02:31:16,310 --> 02:31:16,530
Okay.

2657
02:31:18,490 --> 02:31:20,270
I can't see anything!

2658
02:31:22,670 --> 02:31:24,650
That's a snake.

2659
02:31:28,540 --> 02:31:29,160
Alright.

2660
02:31:29,560 --> 02:31:30,990
Then we go this way.

2661
02:31:32,300 --> 02:31:33,400
Beep beep.

2662
02:31:34,080 --> 02:31:34,940
Light.

2663
02:31:34,940 --> 02:31:35,160
Light.

2664
02:31:35,640 --> 02:31:39,700
The door said there should be light.

2665
02:31:40,900 --> 02:31:42,840
Oh, beautiful light.

2666
02:31:43,960 --> 02:31:45,220
Ah, fuck.

2667
02:31:45,300 --> 02:31:45,500
Okay.

2668
02:31:46,800 --> 02:31:48,220
Oh, there's a safe point.

2669
02:31:48,420 --> 02:31:49,440
It can't be that bad.

2670
02:31:54,190 --> 02:31:55,650
Can't be that bad.

2671
02:31:55,710 --> 02:31:56,750
There's a safe point.

2672
02:31:57,270 --> 02:31:59,930
But why can't I see anything?

2673
02:32:01,710 --> 02:32:02,470
Okay.

2674
02:32:02,730 --> 02:32:03,470
Alright.

2675
02:32:03,470 --> 02:32:03,710
Alright.

2676
02:32:05,830 --> 02:32:06,670
Okay.

2677
02:32:07,290 --> 02:32:08,230
The safe again.

2678
02:32:08,710 --> 02:32:10,050
Is there anything in the yard?

2679
02:32:10,230 --> 02:32:12,770
Is there anything even in the yard?

2680
02:32:20,380 --> 02:32:21,840
Why is it so quiet?

2681
02:32:25,160 --> 02:32:27,000
Why is it...

2682
02:32:28,960 --> 02:32:30,900
Why is it so quiet?

2683
02:32:35,530 --> 02:32:36,050
Why?

2684
02:32:37,170 --> 02:32:38,850
I don't like it.

2685
02:32:39,250 --> 02:32:39,790
Guys.

2686
02:32:40,890 --> 02:32:41,650
Guys.

2687
02:32:41,910 --> 02:32:43,170
I don't like this.

2688
02:32:43,870 --> 02:32:45,790
I don't like how quiet...

2689
02:32:47,550 --> 02:32:50,290
I don't like how quiet it is.

2690
02:32:50,670 --> 02:32:52,010
It's very unnerving.

2691
02:32:53,270 --> 02:32:54,130
Oh, hey, that's me.

2692
02:33:01,250 --> 02:33:02,310
The one...

2693
02:33:02,310 --> 02:33:04,950
Me and my two...

2694
02:33:04,950 --> 02:33:05,770
My bros.

2695
02:33:07,330 --> 02:33:08,710
I still remember like...

2696
02:33:09,550 --> 02:33:10,270
Um...

2697
02:33:10,270 --> 02:33:14,630
When we were like, oh, Mint's gonna go to heaven and we see that.

2698
02:33:14,750 --> 02:33:16,210
I was like, oh, that's not heaven.

2699
02:33:17,170 --> 02:33:17,810
That...

2700
02:33:18,510 --> 02:33:19,630
That's not heaven.

2701
02:33:30,300 --> 02:33:30,940
Alright.

2702
02:33:32,240 --> 02:33:32,880
Oh.

2703
02:33:38,460 --> 02:33:40,520
Oh, so I can open the doors.

2704
02:33:41,460 --> 02:33:41,960
Oh!

2705
02:33:44,400 --> 02:33:46,920
There's a staircase downstairs, though.

2706
02:33:47,980 --> 02:33:49,180
Should I go down the stairs?

2707
02:33:49,180 --> 02:33:50,400
Or should I open the door?

2708
02:33:53,380 --> 02:33:55,380
Which one do I have to do first, chat?

2709
02:33:56,020 --> 02:33:57,060
Staircase or doors?

2710
02:34:04,450 --> 02:34:05,510
There's a...

2711
02:34:05,510 --> 02:34:06,910
There's a staircase here.

2712
02:34:14,090 --> 02:34:15,350
Oh, it's just a door.

2713
02:34:17,450 --> 02:34:17,990
Okay.

2714
02:34:18,490 --> 02:34:21,290
Okay, nevermind.

2715
02:34:21,570 --> 02:34:22,610
I guess we do...

2716
02:34:22,610 --> 02:34:23,670
We do doors.

2717
02:34:23,670 --> 02:34:25,470
Okay, I guess we do.

2718
02:34:26,330 --> 02:34:28,090
Okay, we'll do...

2719
02:34:28,090 --> 02:34:29,470
We'll do doors.

2720
02:34:31,990 --> 02:34:33,510
Oh, uh...

2721
02:34:34,870 --> 02:34:36,110
Put one in.

2722
02:34:38,820 --> 02:34:40,540
I mean, snake.

2723
02:34:42,700 --> 02:34:44,120
That opens the snake, right?

2724
02:34:47,220 --> 02:34:47,980
Yeah.

2725
02:34:48,740 --> 02:34:49,420
Snake door.

2726
02:34:51,080 --> 02:34:51,420
Alright.

2727
02:34:52,420 --> 02:34:53,040
Alright.

2728
02:34:54,790 --> 02:34:55,550
I got my heart.

2729
02:34:55,870 --> 02:34:56,490
I swear.

2730
02:34:56,950 --> 02:34:57,370
Okay.

2731
02:34:57,930 --> 02:34:58,250
Alright.

2732
02:35:00,290 --> 02:35:01,670
Fucking heart, man.

2733
02:35:01,970 --> 02:35:03,390
I got this game.

2734
02:35:03,830 --> 02:35:06,470
I can only take this game in, like, small doses.

2735
02:35:06,650 --> 02:35:07,290
I'm sorry.

2736
02:35:07,970 --> 02:35:09,030
This game is...

2737
02:35:09,030 --> 02:35:11,690
This game is actually gonna...

2738
02:35:11,690 --> 02:35:12,650
The death of me.

2739
02:35:14,750 --> 02:35:16,890
There's so much anxiety playing it.

2740
02:35:23,710 --> 02:35:24,470
Alright.

2741
02:35:24,690 --> 02:35:24,810
Alright.

2742
02:35:24,810 --> 02:35:25,730
Oh, this is like...

2743
02:35:25,730 --> 02:35:26,030
Oh.

2744
02:35:26,830 --> 02:35:30,210
Oh, that's not interrogation room.

2745
02:35:34,250 --> 02:35:36,070
That's not interrogation.

2746
02:35:48,390 --> 02:35:50,470
I need more syringes.

2747
02:35:51,150 --> 02:35:52,470
I need more ammo.

2748
02:35:52,590 --> 02:35:53,970
I just need more regular ammo.

2749
02:35:58,290 --> 02:35:58,810
Alright.

2750
02:36:11,130 --> 02:36:11,650
Alright.

2751
02:36:14,890 --> 02:36:14,970
Alright.

2752
02:36:14,970 --> 02:36:15,070
Whoa.

2753
02:36:16,010 --> 02:36:17,110
Oh, hey there.

2754
02:36:18,010 --> 02:36:19,050
Oh, hey there.

2755
02:36:20,170 --> 02:36:20,690
Is it timed?

2756
02:36:20,850 --> 02:36:21,870
It's fucking timed.

2757
02:36:21,870 --> 02:36:23,410
I knew it's always timed.

2758
02:36:24,010 --> 02:36:26,030
It's always fucking timed.

2759
02:36:26,230 --> 02:36:27,390
Okay, I'll wait for it.

2760
02:36:28,590 --> 02:36:30,890
We'll do snake room first.

2761
02:36:31,170 --> 02:36:31,670
Okay.

2762
02:36:34,270 --> 02:36:34,950
Alright.

2763
02:36:45,680 --> 02:36:46,080
Stop!

2764
02:36:48,100 --> 02:36:48,660
Wait.

2765
02:36:49,740 --> 02:36:50,280
Alright.

2766
02:36:51,340 --> 02:36:52,260
Why you no stop?

2767
02:36:52,260 --> 02:36:52,340
Stop.

2768
02:36:55,240 --> 02:36:56,220
Ah, fuck.

2769
02:36:56,300 --> 02:36:56,520
Okay.

2770
02:36:57,560 --> 02:36:58,520
I said stop.

2771
02:37:00,300 --> 02:37:02,340
Chat, I did say stop.

2772
02:37:07,220 --> 02:37:09,140
I made one request.

2773
02:37:12,140 --> 02:37:13,500
Oh, what the fuck?

2774
02:37:13,860 --> 02:37:14,280
Okay.

2775
02:37:25,380 --> 02:37:27,080
We'll be together soon.

2776
02:37:27,120 --> 02:37:28,960
Oh, I don't like the sound of that.

2777
02:37:33,770 --> 02:37:34,870
Can we get there?

2778
02:37:41,180 --> 02:37:41,800
I can hear him.

2779
02:37:52,800 --> 02:37:54,480
I fucking knew it.

2780
02:37:54,580 --> 02:37:55,560
Where are you?

2781
02:38:01,580 --> 02:38:03,060
I knew it.

2782
02:38:03,140 --> 02:38:04,500
I fucking knew it.

2783
02:38:05,440 --> 02:38:07,960
Bro, don't announce yourself.

2784
02:38:15,840 --> 02:38:16,640
Oh my god.

2785
02:38:17,700 --> 02:38:18,420
Okay.

2786
02:38:19,540 --> 02:38:20,760
What the fuck?

2787
02:38:21,340 --> 02:38:22,200
What the?

2788
02:38:27,190 --> 02:38:27,910
Okay.

2789
02:38:28,130 --> 02:38:28,770
Fuck you.

2790
02:38:28,810 --> 02:38:30,330
Where did that guy come from?

2791
02:38:30,330 --> 02:38:32,730
Now there's lake spiders?

2792
02:38:34,750 --> 02:38:35,630
James.

2793
02:38:36,310 --> 02:38:37,190
Please.

2794
02:38:37,290 --> 02:38:39,030
What is your kink list?

2795
02:38:40,270 --> 02:38:41,410
At this point...

2796
02:38:41,410 --> 02:38:43,250
It's like a fucking book.

2797
02:38:48,200 --> 02:38:50,100
It's a book at this point.

2798
02:38:53,420 --> 02:38:55,140
Like, oh my god.

2799
02:38:55,200 --> 02:38:56,500
You're fucking freaky.

2800
02:38:56,960 --> 02:38:58,180
Wow, fuck!

2801
02:38:59,900 --> 02:39:01,660
Where did it jump to?

2802
02:39:05,560 --> 02:39:07,380
Where did it go?

2803
02:39:15,460 --> 02:39:16,380
Where did it go?

2804
02:39:26,880 --> 02:39:28,320
I'm letting my anger out.

2805
02:39:33,870 --> 02:39:35,050
Bro, okay.

2806
02:39:37,710 --> 02:39:39,470
It's not overkill.

2807
02:39:43,930 --> 02:39:46,390
It's not overkill, guys.

2808
02:39:47,350 --> 02:39:49,410
I'm over it.

2809
02:39:49,410 --> 02:39:50,150
I'm over it.

2810
02:39:51,010 --> 02:39:53,130
I'm so over it.

2811
02:39:53,230 --> 02:39:54,090
Are you?

2812
02:40:01,850 --> 02:40:02,810
Okay.

2813
02:40:05,730 --> 02:40:07,150
Fucking hell.

2814
02:40:11,440 --> 02:40:12,680
That made me sad.

2815
02:40:19,900 --> 02:40:22,500
That made me so sad.

2816
02:40:28,360 --> 02:40:29,640
God damn it.

2817
02:40:29,740 --> 02:40:31,020
Oh my god, okay.

2818
02:40:34,680 --> 02:40:35,600
Fucking hell.

2819
02:40:39,100 --> 02:40:39,920
Grab the ammo.

2820
02:40:41,740 --> 02:40:42,800
Grab the ammo.

2821
02:40:46,220 --> 02:40:47,580
What am I supposed to do?

2822
02:41:16,340 --> 02:41:18,260
Guys, I don't think I was supposed to do that.

2823
02:41:18,780 --> 02:41:19,380
Guys.

2824
02:41:21,260 --> 02:41:21,860
Guys.

2825
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,600
I don't think I was supposed to do that.

2826
02:41:28,140 --> 02:41:30,920
Alright, we'll let future Toki handle this one.

2827
02:41:33,780 --> 02:41:36,060
Today was a long day.

2828
02:41:37,540 --> 02:41:39,140
This is like JoJo.

2829
02:41:40,280 --> 02:41:41,080
JoJo.

2830
02:41:42,240 --> 02:41:45,740
Like a JoJo scene to be continued.

2831
02:41:46,500 --> 02:41:49,140
Yeah, this is a to be continued moment.

2832
02:41:49,140 --> 02:41:49,460
I did that.

2833
02:41:51,360 --> 02:42:00,060
Current Toki does not want to handle that anymore.

2834
02:42:00,780 --> 02:42:03,500
Current Toki is done.

2835
02:42:08,700 --> 02:42:10,020
Yeah, yeah.

2836
02:42:11,520 --> 02:42:13,640
Current Toki is done.

2837
02:42:13,820 --> 02:42:17,360
When the doors opened, it was GG.

2838
02:42:19,180 --> 02:42:20,060
Please.

2839
02:42:20,500 --> 02:42:22,760
Door opens, Current Toki.

2840
02:42:23,140 --> 02:42:25,280
Alright, I guess goodbye.

2841
02:42:32,980 --> 02:42:34,840
Oh my god.

2842
02:42:36,260 --> 02:42:38,580
I'm gonna save just in case.

2843
02:42:38,680 --> 02:42:39,980
I'm gonna save my game.

2844
02:42:43,980 --> 02:42:45,420
My stomach.

2845
02:42:49,140 --> 02:42:51,200
My stomach, I'm so...

2846
02:42:51,200 --> 02:42:53,140
I'm just...

2847
02:42:56,780 --> 02:42:58,300
So much meat shit.

2848
02:42:58,420 --> 02:42:59,840
So much anxiety.

2849
02:43:03,120 --> 02:43:05,380
I only, I can only take Silent Hill.

2850
02:43:05,500 --> 02:43:06,340
Then spot doses.

2851
02:43:06,700 --> 02:43:09,140
Like this game actually freaks me out so much.

2852
02:43:13,800 --> 02:43:14,360
Alright.

2853
02:43:14,720 --> 02:43:16,260
That was a good run though.

2854
02:43:16,260 --> 02:43:17,440
That was a good...

2855
02:43:17,440 --> 02:43:20,360
That was a good...

2856
02:43:20,360 --> 02:43:22,140
Two hours and a half.

2857
02:43:22,840 --> 02:43:24,520
We did a long street day today.

2858
02:43:24,800 --> 02:43:26,200
Tomorrow's gonna be a long day as well.

2859
02:43:27,060 --> 02:43:27,840
But today...

2860
02:43:28,360 --> 02:43:30,000
Today we had that rush stream.

2861
02:43:30,080 --> 02:43:31,480
And then we go straight to Silent Hill.

2862
02:43:31,660 --> 02:43:33,180
So we got a lot of Dokiem today.

2863
02:43:33,680 --> 02:43:34,820
Nexie, thank you for the superchat.

2864
02:43:34,880 --> 02:43:35,720
Thank you, thank you.

2865
02:43:37,140 --> 02:43:38,860
The Doki-Hi case arrived today.

2866
02:43:40,160 --> 02:43:41,820
Super excited to build my new PC.

2867
02:43:41,940 --> 02:43:43,100

2868
02:43:43,200 --> 02:43:44,300
Thank you for the superchat, Nexie.

2869
02:43:44,300 --> 02:43:45,120
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2870
02:43:45,260 --> 02:43:48,340
I'm so happy that the Hiate cases are finally arriving.

2871
02:43:49,680 --> 02:43:50,800

2872

So yeah, if you wanna support Hiate and support me.

2879

It really does help a lot.

2880
02:44:09,120 --> 02:44:11,020
They've been like really great towards me.

2881
02:44:11,020 --> 02:44:13,720
So it really does help a lot to support Hiate as well, guys.

2882
02:44:13,780 --> 02:44:15,720
So yeah, I'm shilling, I'm shilling.

2883
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:16,980
I'm trying to do my best.

2884
02:44:18,320 --> 02:44:20,620
It gives me a lot more opportunities in the future.

2885
02:44:20,880 --> 02:44:23,360
So please check it out if you can.

2886
02:44:23,760 --> 02:44:25,480
Anyway guys, I'm gonna rest now.

2887
02:44:25,660 --> 02:44:27,960
I have a rehearsal tonight for Kamifero.

2888
02:44:28,640 --> 02:44:30,520
So I'm gonna go head off now.

2889
02:44:31,200 --> 02:44:33,500
I hope you guys had a great time with me today.

2890
02:44:33,640 --> 02:44:35,200
I always have a great time with you dragons.

2891
02:44:35,840 --> 02:44:38,020
As always, everybody stay hydrated.

2892
02:44:38,300 --> 02:44:38,820
Posture check.

2893
02:44:38,820 --> 02:44:40,680
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

2894
02:44:40,840 --> 02:44:42,540
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

2895
02:44:42,640 --> 02:44:43,860
Cause you deserve it.

2896
02:44:43,960 --> 02:44:45,060
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

2897
02:44:45,320 --> 02:44:46,060
Bye guys.

2898
02:44:46,300 --> 02:44:46,800
Bye!

2899
02:45:11,500 --> 02:45:13,280
I just saw...

2900
02:45:13,280 --> 02:45:16,880
The Vtuber nominations just came out.

2901
02:45:17,280 --> 02:45:19,240
I guess nominate me.

2902
02:45:22,140 --> 02:45:24,100
It'll be great...

2903
02:45:24,100 --> 02:45:26,360
To be nominated again.

2904
02:45:26,760 --> 02:45:28,000
But like...

2905
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:29,800
I can win it as...

2906
02:45:29,800 --> 02:45:30,340
Jokey.

2907
02:45:31,260 --> 02:45:32,460
That's really it.

2908
02:45:33,320 --> 02:45:34,500
I guess like...

2909
02:45:34,500 --> 02:45:36,500
I'd love to be gamer of the year.

You know...

02:45:44,740 --> 02:45:46,500
I can have it as Jokey Braid.

2915
02:45:50,220 --> 02:45:51,420
