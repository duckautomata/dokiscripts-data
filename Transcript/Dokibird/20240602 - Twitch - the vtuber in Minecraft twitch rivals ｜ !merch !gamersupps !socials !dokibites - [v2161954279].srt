1
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,460
Oh!

2
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,600
Oh my god!

3
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,980
Are you an actual bad boy?

4
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,500
Are you?

5
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,820
Yeah?

6
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,500
What's the baddest thing you've done?

7
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,520
Yeah, name five!

8
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:15,800
Yeah?

9
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,580
Oh my god!

10
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,120
You're a goddamn criminal!

11
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,560
You're goddamn crazy!

12
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,560
That is hardcore, man!

13
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:35,660
Whoa!

14
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:45,660
That's... that's... that's messed up, man.

15
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,920
That's so messed up.

16
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,110
Like, right off the bat?

17
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,460
Oh shit.

18
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,620
You guys don't hear it?

19
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,500
You guys don't hear this sound?

20
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,760
I think it's just too quiet.

21
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,320
There's no way you guys don't hear this!

22
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,440
Okay, I'm turning it up.

23
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:17,920
Yeah.

24
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,960
Wait, they said it in general?

25
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,040
You guys don't hear it?

26
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,040
Okay, give me a sec.

27
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,580
Let me fix this.

28
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,900
Oh, there you are.

29
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:35,720
No, no, no.

30
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,740
It's up to you.

31
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,520
You can continue streaming something else.

32
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:39,920
Oh, okay.

33
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:40,780
Glad they gave me that.

34
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,620
No, you have to end right away.

35
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,860
Yeah, yeah, you just end it.

36
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,040
Wait, you can't even spectate people.

37
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:47,980
That's messed up.

38
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:53,240
Is that why they gave us the... Is that why they made us skip the part?

39
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,580
Wait, you gave your stream key... Did you also give their credit card number too?

40
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,400
So they can charge...

41
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,300
Oh, I think... I didn't do that.

42
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:08,600
Wait, you guys didn't give them your credit card number too in the last three digits on the back?

43
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,660
I have to go do something really quick.

44
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,000
Oh, look at that.

45
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,300
I'm sure that'll be alright.

46
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:18,820
Yeah.

47
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,260
Yeah, I'm probably sure.

48
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,060
What are you gonna do?

49
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,220
We're streamers.

50
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:22,980
We're broke already.

51
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,020
Yeah.

52
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,500
Yeah.

53
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,900
Yeah, we're not even gonna get money if we get eliminated in the first four days.

54
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,580
We're doing this... We're doing this for exposure.

55
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:39,660
Yeah.

56
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,040
Exposure.

57
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:41,640
Yeah.

58
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,540
Yeah, that's how they're paying us.

59
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

60
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,120
Do you guys know, uh, the first event?

61
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,080
Like, what the details are?

62
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,740
Is it really just a red light, green light?

63
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:53,900
Is it red light, green light?

64
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,140
I didn't really understand the rules.

65
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:00,140
It was like, they're like, there's boxes that you can hit to get, like, benefits and stuff.

66
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:00,640
And I was like...

67
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,420
It's like Mario Kart.

68
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,920
Yeah, it's like Mario Kart, red light, green light.

69
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,160
Like, do you die if you move when the light's off?

70
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,960
Because it didn't say that.

71
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,820
Oh my god, what if it's a crab game?

72
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,200
Where, like, you know...

73
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,780
I'm pretty sure this is basically, like, crab game, but spooky.

74
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,900
Because did you see in the rules?

75
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,020
They were like, you gotta be immersed as if you're actually in a haunted house.

76
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,800
And you gotta role play and stuff.

77
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,060
It's like GTA RP.

78
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,880
But in Minecraft.

79
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:27,660
Oh.

80
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,200
Oh, okay.

81
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,040
Yeah.

82
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,260
I think it's like Crab Game S, where you can probably just punch someone to make them move.

83
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,400
And then...

84
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,980
Oh, that's true.

85
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,900
But we're allies, right guys?

86
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,920
Yeah, we're allies.

87
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,040
Guys, right?

88
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,900
We're not gonna punch each other, right?

89
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,260
Yeah, no, we're all friends.

90
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:48,980
Yeah.

91
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,560
We're all good.

92
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,560
If you punch Gumi and I, you're punching babies.

93
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,560
Because we just installed Minecraft today.

94
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,160
Wouldn't want to do that.

95
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:58,720
Yeah.

96
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,080
You're a baby puncher.

97
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,340
She's so new to Minecraft.

98
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,360
She barely plays Minecraft.

99
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:02,820
Yeah.

100
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,500
I don't even have my own skin.

101
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,600
I'm a bear.

102
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,120
That's when you know I'm a baby.

103
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,760
Oh, hello.

104
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,560
Hello.

105
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:15,380
Friends?

106
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,040
Yeah.

107
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,000
Can you guys hear me?

108
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,960
Oh, no, we can hear you.

109
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,520
It's just the quality is very terrible because there's a lot of people on the server.

110
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,120
Okay, thank god.

111
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:25,440
Thank you.

112
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,760
So, the more people are eliminated, the better the bandwidth.

113
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,170
Hey, guys, how's the volume, by the way?

114
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,890
Oh, did you guys see the animatronics?

115
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:38,710
Oh, yeah.

116
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,110
The FNAF at home.

117
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:40,670
That's so cool.

118
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,310
Yeah.

119
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:43,450
Guys, chat.

120
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,270
Look, look, look, chat.

121
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,530
That one's gone.

122
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,030
There's FNAF at home.

123
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:48,970
Wish FNAF.

124
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:50,590
Huh?

125
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,010
What the heck is...

126
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,630
Your mic...

127
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,810
Your voice chat is so messed up.

128
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,810
We can't hear anything.

129
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,510
It's like...

130
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:07,850
Hello.

131
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,750
Oh, that sounds scary.

132
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:19,550
Oh, yeah.

133
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,070
Look at the server, though, guys.

134
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:21,930
It's actually crazy.

135
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:24,430
Let's see.

136
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,950
I'm gonna make sure Sound Guy's just double-checking stuff for me.

137
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:30,970
Oh, my gosh.

138
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,070
I love your... I love your skin.

139
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:33,670
Oh, my gosh.

140
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:33,850
Hey.

141
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:34,450
Oh, my gosh.

142
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,650
I'm a bear farmer.

143
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:36,250
Hello.

144
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:37,290
Hello.

145
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:38,690
Yeah.

146
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:40,950
I'm a bear farmer.

147
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,970
I'm here to farm.

148
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,770
I love it.

149
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:45,150
I love it.

150
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,250
I'm new to Minecraft.

151
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,350
This is my first day.

152
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:48,750
I just installed it today.

153
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,030
Yeah, she just installed it.

154
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,070
She doesn't even know how to crouch.

155
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,990
Yeah, I don't even have my own skin.

156
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,670
That's when you know you should not...

157
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,690
You should, like, let me get through the first round.

158
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,830
As, like, a make-a-wish.

159
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,710
This is my make-a-wish to get through the first round.

160
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:07,730
Oh, man.

161
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,670
Oh, Ducky.

162
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:12,170
Yeah?

163
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,670
His name is Toppo.

164
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:14,150
Hello.

165
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,530
Hi, gaming.

166
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:15,950
Hello.

167
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,270
Hello, guys.

168
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:18,970
Hello, Doc.

169
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,850
It's me, Doc.

170
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:21,530
Doc.

171
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,970
We need to win.

172
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,170
I gave you up the McStuffins variety or just Doc?

173
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,310
I'm just... Yeah, you can just call me Doc.

174
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,230
That's my name.

175
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:29,590
All right.

176
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:30,830
I'll call you Doc McStuffins.

177
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:31,310
That's wrong.

178
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,230
Yeah, that's right.

179
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:32,870
That is insane.

180
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,170
I've been to Freddy's.

181
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:36,810
Goodbye.

182
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:37,870
I mean, technically, it's not that weird.

183
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:38,270
What do you mean?

184
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:38,850
Yeah, yeah.

185
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,050
What's the copyright-free version of this?

186
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:46,650
For legal reasons, what is the name of these guys?

187
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,230
I don't know.

188
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,050
For legal reasons, what are their names?

189
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,170
We should name them right now.

190
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:56,870
This one.

191
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,910
It's a good name for this one.

192
00:08:59,050 --> 00:08:59,670
Oh, my God.

193
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:03,810
Ralph.

194
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,730
Oh, heck yes.

195
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:05,530
Oh, my God.

196
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:06,490
This is Ralph.

197
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,370
Five Nights at Ralph's?

198
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,790
Five Nights at Ralph's?

199
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,650
Um...

200
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,050
Poe.

201
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,250
What should the name be?

202
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:15,630
Poe.

203
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:19,890
Okay, I think now we're going through legal territory now.

204
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,690
Wait, you don't want me to defend Poe?

205
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,550
Now we're going back to maybe getting a cease and desist letter.

206
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,130
Okay, how about Steve?

207
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,490
Oh, my God.

208
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:32,710
My favorite game.

209
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,530
Five Nights at Steve's.

210
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:34,970
Oh, yeah.

211
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:37,490
Oh, Minecraft has Steve copyrighted.

212
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:37,950
Is that...

213
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:38,810
Come on.

214
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:39,270
That's crazy.

215
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:39,770
Oh, my God.

216
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,410
No, maybe like Bartholomew.

217
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:42,970
Cookie.

218
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:43,410
Yeah.

219
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,910
Oh, not even a cookie, man.

220
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:45,610
That's actually a good name.

221
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,310
Yeah, what is it?

222
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:49,530
What if...

223
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:50,310
Yeah?

224
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,370
What if there's hide-and-seek in the next few days?

225
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,830
I've been looking around for good hiding spots.

226
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,050
Oh, is there actually hide-and-seek?

227
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,230
Wait, you're friends with the admin.

228
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,470
Ask her.

229
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,230
Ask her what the game is.

230
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:02,310
No.

231
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,290
You're literally friends with the creators.

232
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,430
Ask them what the games are.

233
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,190
You're right.

234
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:09,430
You're right.

235
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:09,750
You're right.

236
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:26,830
Just be like, hey, I'll never tell people what the games are, but like, you know, I'm not going to make it to the next rounds, but I'm just curious, what are the next couple of games?

237
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:28,170
Oh, I like that.

238
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,670
I like that.

239
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:28,830
Yeah.

240
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:29,530
Yeah.

241
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:30,070
Yeah.

242
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:30,230
Yeah.

243
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:30,370
Yeah.

244
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:30,470
Yeah.

245
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:30,510
Yeah.

246
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,930
Send that DM right now.

247
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:36,190
Don't worry.

248
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,090
I have your stream open.

249
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,810
So you can send it whenever.

250
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:42,550
Oh, look.

251
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,370
This is a pretty good hiding spot.

252
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:44,850
Oh, shit.

253
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,930
Wait, that's actually insane.

254
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,630
I don't even know how I can get up there.

255
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:49,490
You can't see me at all.

256
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:50,250
Yeah.

257
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,410
I can only see your name.

258
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:52,550
Wait, no.

259
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,070
I don't even...

260
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:53,910
Wait, where are you?

261
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,010
Where did you go?

262
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,010
Where did you go?

263
00:10:59,590 --> 00:10:59,950
Wait.

264
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,450
Do you not see me?

265
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,310
No, I don't.

266
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,190
Your nametag disappeared.

267
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,100
Hiding spot.

268
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,540
Yeah, your nametag disappeared.

269
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,320
Also, are we supposed to reconvene somewhere?

270
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,780
Where did they start the first game without us?

271
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,320
I don't know.

272
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:27,180
That would be pretty embarrassing if we just got instantly eliminated.

273
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:30,740
All right.

274
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,280
I'm going to double check the announcement.

275
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,060
Oh, apparently not.

276
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,640
Oh, let's see.

277
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,880
Not everybody's in the server yet.

278
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,640
Wait, what the heck?

279
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,240
They're late.

280
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,620
They're 12 minutes late.

281
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,460
Eliminate them.

282
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,220
How dare they?

283
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,000
Eliminate them.

284
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,020
Right now.

285
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:47,860
Wait.

286
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:53,480
If we eliminate the 12 people, only eight people have to be eliminated on the next one.

287
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,300
Because they're late.

288
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,260
Oh, my God.

289
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,300
That means we get to go through the first round for free.

290
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,340
I think so, too.

291
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,000
But don't you see me here?

292
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:05,720
Nope.

293
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,700
I don't even know where you are.

294
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:07,660
Oh, wait.

295
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:07,860
I see you.

296
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,020
I see you.

297
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,640
How did you do that?

298
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:13,980
Slash TP.

299
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,940
I don't need TP yet.

300
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,040
I know you're going to run around and jump on that bush.

301
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:22,960
What the fuck?

302
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:23,780
The one I'm standing on.

303
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,740
I can barely see.

304
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,400
Okay.

305
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,940
I can't even see anything.

306
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,780
What do you got there?

307
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,300
Am I standing in the right area?

308
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,520
Wait, maybe I'm going to up the brightness.

309
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,660
How do I up the brightness?

310
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,460
I'm just going to try to up the brightness.

311
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,800
Okay, I upped the brightness.

312
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,620
I still can barely see, but that's okay.

313
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,540
Run, forward, jump.

314
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,020
Run, forward, jump.

315
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,040
Okay.

316
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,320
You're hitting this wall.

317
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,320
You have to make it past the wall and then turn in.

318
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,680
Oh no, and apparently there's a parkour course later.

319
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,220
Oh, I made it!

320
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,200
Oh, almost.

321
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,520
You made it one under.

322
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,560
Wait, are you above me?

323
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,500
Yeah, yeah, look up.

324
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,420
Yeah, yeah.

325
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,280
Oh, okay.

326
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,480
Why is this so dark?

327
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,700
Oh, no!

328
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,660
I give up.

329
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,720
I'll just die.

330
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,520
I'll die underneath you.

331
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,960
So they'll know that you're...

332
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,380
So they'll be like, oh, we got the person.

333
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,460
So they'll run away and then you'll be safe.

334
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,540
Oh my god, and then I split the money with you.

335
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:43,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

336
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,120
And then you split $1,000, like 60-40.

337
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:48,860
60-40.

338
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,260
$7,000?

339
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,580
60-40?

340
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,380
What?

341
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,260
I...

342
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,660
I helped you get to the end.

343
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,780
If it wasn't for me, you'd be cut.

344
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,840
All I'm saying...

345
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,380
And then we go to Japan together and you promise to pay for part of it.

346
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,840
Oh, you did it!

347
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,220
You did it!

348
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,540
Wait, I did it, but I jumped away!

349
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:14,760
Okay.

350
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,060
No!

351
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,400
You jumped... I keep jumping past it.

352
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:25,700
But like, if we all... but if we're both on the same hiding spot, wouldn't we both die at the same time?

353
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,780
No, because look, it's like... Okay, get up here.

354
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,460
Get up.

355
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:31,820
I'm here.

356
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,300
I'm here.

357
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,020
They can't see me.

358
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:34,780
No, make the jump.

359
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,280
Make the jump.

360
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:35,780
Make the jump.

361
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,280
Okay, okay, okay.

362
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,020
I can see you very clearly.

363
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,720
They can't... they can't see me.

364
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,020
No!

365
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,480
I keep fucking...

366
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,400
Okay, make the jump.

367
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,820
Hold your crouch button.

368
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,240
Okay.

369
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,960
Oh my god, pro Minecraft trap.

370
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,660
Oh my god, we did it.

371
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,020
Okay, jump up.

372
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:50,380
Jump up here.

373
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,400
And then you stay in that corner.

374
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,420
I'll stay in the other corner.

375
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:54,460
Okay.

376
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,740
Because I can't see you.

377
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,020
Yeah, yeah, you don't know where I am.

378
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,100
I can't see anything either.

379
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,740
Girl, you just walked into me.

380
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,520
But I can't see anything.

381
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,780
And then if you hold crouch, you hide your name tag.

382
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,200
Oh!

383
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,500
Wait, that's so smart!

384
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,080
Oh my god, we're gonna win this.

385
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,880
We're gonna so win that $70,000.

386
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,060
60-40.

387
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:22,780
Alright, so guys, I mean... Alright guys, so this is a custom Minecraft...

388
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,240
Horror map.

389
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,540
They actually made an entire installation for this.

390
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,580
Like, there was a whole folder.

391
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:33,100
Okay, we're only waiting on one person who has some tech issues.

392
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,220
Oh my god.

393
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,060
Who is that?

394
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,180
Call him out right now.

395
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,760
Who is it?

396
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,820
Yeah, call him out, admins.

397
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,040
Yeah, call him out.

398
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,400
Call him out on stream.

399
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,220
So they actually made an entire, like, world pack.

400
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,580
And you just, like, download.

401
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,340
You just download the file.

402
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,800
And then, like...

403
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,020
Wait, is that Mickey Mouse?

404
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,240
Oh my god, Mickey's in the server?

405
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,440
Oh my god.

406
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,940
I can't believe they got Mickey.

407
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,900
Yeah, so like, basically, like, we don't even... We're not even using the Minecraft launcher.

408
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,720
We're using a custom launcher for this.

409
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,400
So, like, all your, like, texture packs, resource packs, don't even...

410
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,780
Don't even, like, show up for this.

411
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,100
So, like, when you install it, everything is already there.

412
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,220
Oh, you're gonna make tacos?

413
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,040
Okay, I'll talk to my chat then.

414
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:31,500
What?

415
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,600
Can you talk to my chat too?

416
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,460
Okay, I'll talk to your chat as well.

417
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,000
Okay, don't worry.

418
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,080
I'll entertain your chat as well.

419
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,140
Are you gone yet?

420
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:37,840
Okay.

421
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,120
Are you still here?

422
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,700
Yeah, tell a story that I would tell your chat.

423
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:45,640
Okay, okay.

424
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,260
When you're gone.

425
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,160
Let me know when you're gone.

426
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:48,800
I'm gone.

427
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:49,780
Okay.

428
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,580
Are you still here?

429
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,380
Okay, alright.

430
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,640
So, people in Gumi's chat, come to my...

431
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,920
I stream on YouTube.

432
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,620
You son of a bitch.

433
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,260
You son of a bitch.

434
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,180
I knew you would do this shit.

435
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,120
I knew you would do this shit.

436
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:03,860
I just knew it.

437
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,900
I didn't leave because I knew it.

438
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,200
Well, I knew you didn't leave so I was testing you.

439
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,100
I was testing you to see if you were still here or not.

440
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,280
I knew you didn't leave.

441
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,920
I'm not even going to tell you when I leave.

442
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,780
Just keep talking.

443
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:24,800
Okay.

444
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,180
Anyway, guys.

445
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:33,680
Anyway, so I was talking to my chat about this map because I don't know if Gumi introduced it.

446
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,900
But basically, this is a Twitch Rivals Minecraft.

447
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,800
Oh, hi.

448
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,040
I came from Gumi's chat.

449
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,800
Oh, hey.

450
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,220
Hey.

451
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,240
Anyway.

452
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,300
So, this is basically...

453
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:49,340
Everything in here was like custom made just for this event.

454
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,620
So, there's like 150 participants.

455
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,300
And it's basically like Squid Game but what if it's spooky?

456
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,400
So, it's like a haunted mansion.

457
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:09,160
It's so funny because in the rules, they were like, please role play and immerse your viewers and immerse all the other participants as if you're really trapped in a haunted house.

458
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,540
And I was like reading that.

459
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,820
I was like, what the fuck?

460
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,800
So, but it's actually crazy though.

461
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:26,500
The amount of detail and the amount of like the amount of like effort they put into this entire world because everything is custom here.

462
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,420
Like you see the resource packs, the like the voice chat and everything.

463
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:34,920
And like almost everything in here was just like Squid Game.

464
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,200
But like what if it's a haunted mansion type deal?

465
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,140
And apparently, there's going to be two games.

466
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,000
It's going to last like...

467
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,520
Six days or something.

468
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,740
But each day, people get eliminated.

469
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:50,200
And apparently, the first game is some red light, green light thing.

470
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:55,280
I read the rules for the first two games because every day is like two games.

471
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:59,420
And I got so confused because I didn't even realize it was supposed to be red light, green light.

472
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,020
I was like looking at it.

473
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,800
I'm like, this is red light, green light.

474
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,000
But maybe I'm illiterate.

475
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,540
Anyway, so I think like the first game, 20 people gets eliminated.

476
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:17,380
And then I don't know what happens the second game because I'm going to see if I can survive the first game.

477
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,660
And yeah, they're like you can have allies and everything.

478
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,520
Oh, yeah.

479
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,160
Apparently, the rules was like you should not be swearing.

480
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,920
But like I guess like you could swear on your own stream.

481
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,040
But like not like during voice chat, I assume.

482
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,780
But like I'm already talking in voice chat.

483
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,680
So like, oh, this is going to be an issue.

484
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,580
But they're like no profanity allowed.

485
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:48,860
So like, yeah, I'm pretty sure I broke the rules already when it comes to profanity.

486
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,560
But there's like 150 people here.

487
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,240
Only top 20 wins money.

488
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,720
But don't worry.

489
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,440
We're just doing this for exposure.

490
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:04,000
I know there's like lots of Minecraft players on here because this is a Minecraft event.

491
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:10,980
So like, yeah, we're not going to be making it to top 20 because Minecraft players are at a whole nother level.

492
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:15,160
They've been doing like these Minecraft like the and what was it called?

493
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:19,560
The Minecraft championship, the MCC shit like that.

494
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,720
They've been doing this on the daily.

495
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:28,700
So if we make it past day one, that's a win on my book.

496
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,780
Anyway, it's fun, though.

497
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:35,280
I got me lots of Gumi's friends and talking to a lot of people.

498
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:39,620
But yeah, Minecraft players are a whole nother level when it comes to mini games.

499
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:43,600
So like, it'd be nice to just, you know, survive the first day.

500
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,660
All right.

501
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,960
I hope Gumi's chat was entertaining.

502
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,040
Got like exposition for this tournament.

503
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:55,740
But yeah.

504
00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:00,700
Anyway, if I don't live past day one, then it's rest week for me.

505
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,300
Yay.

506
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,660
I get to...

507
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,700
It's a win-win.

508
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,260
If I make it past day one, wow.

509
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,940
I beat some Minecraft players on day one.

510
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,420
If I don't make it past day one, yay.

511
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,260
I get a vacation.

512
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,080
So it's a win-win, honestly.

513
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,740
But yeah, a lot of...

514
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,260
Yeah.

515
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:26,440
I mean, they got 150 streamers.

516
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:34,240
That is an accomplishment on its own because they managed to get 150 streamers to coordinate their schedules for this one event.

517
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,380
And that's like...

518
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:38,240
It's very difficult to get like 30.

519
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:46,340
I had a rough time coordinating the schedule for like 30 people.

520
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,040
So think about 150 in one place.

521
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,300
Yeah.

522
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,820
It's actually crazy though.

523
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,440
It's crazy.

524
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,540
It's Minecraft.

525
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,520
It's not like they have...

526
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,200
What the heck?

527
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,320
I mean, they'll be playing Minecraft anyway.

528
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:12,880
But it's basically like a merge of like different streamers from different communities.

529
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,580
There's like Spanish streamers too.

530
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:19,820
Because there's the server, the Discord server was...

531
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:25,200
Has like instructions in both Spanish and English.

532
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:31,860
Because like I know like Minecraft is really, really popular for like Spanish speakers as well.

533
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,080
So yeah.

534
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,560
There were a lot of like Spanish speaking Minecraft players.

535
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,200
Earlier when I logged in and everything.

536
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,360
So yeah.

537
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,560
I was so surprised.

538
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,560
I didn't realize Minecraft...

539
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,160
I guess like Quackity.

540
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,080
It would make sense.

541
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:48,360
Because Quackity is like one of their biggest streamers on Twitch.

542
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,560
But yeah.

543
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:55,140
Minecraft is like incredibly popular for Spanish speaker viewers.

544
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,120
Are you back yet?

545
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,040
Did you make your taco?

546
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,280
Okay guys.

547
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:02,720
Anyway.

548
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,660

611
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,520

613
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,640

614
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,120
We ball.

615
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,640
Fuck it.

616
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,120
Oh.

617
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:01,400
Oh.

618
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,060
All right.

619
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:02,200
Whoa.

620
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:03,300
Wait.

621
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,680
Did you see the rule where we're supposed to put it on email only mode when we start the game?

622
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,080
Yeah.

623
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:08,700
Did you.

624
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,580
Are you going to do that?

625
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,560
I already did it man.

626
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,040
Oh.

627
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,100
That's why they're in my chat talk.

628
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,120
That makes sense.

629
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,120
Because I.

630
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,540
I didn't do it.

631
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,460
So yeah.

632
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,240
For those who don't know.

633
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:30,680
We're.

634
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,260
We're supposed to.

635
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:31,400
We're supposed to.

636
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:38,280
We're supposed to put our chats at emote only mode to prevent people from cheating and ghosting and stuff.

637
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,420
But like they said.

638
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,200
We can do it when the game starts.

639
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,200
The game hasn't started yet.

640
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,300
That's the thing.

641
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,340
So yeah.

642
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,000

643
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:47,540

645
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,220
The first round starts.

646
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,200
Please put it at emote only mode.

647
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:52,840
Mm hmm.

648
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,720

649
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:57,640
This taco is so freaking good.

650
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,940
Are you eating your taco?

651
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,300

653
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,340

654
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:03,980
Whoa.

655
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,320
In front of everybody.

656
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:08,640

657
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:11,540

Yeah.

660
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:13,240
Yeah.

661
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:19,980
All right.

662
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:20,780

Go explore a little bit more.

665
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,360
Hey there's Link.

666
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:25,780
You want me to sit on taco?

667
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,060
You want me to sit on taco?

668
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,080
You have one.

669
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:28,860
You have two hands.

670
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,160
One hand can eat the taco.

671
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:32,440
Okay.

672
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:32,720

I'm going to go push a talk then.

675
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:34,680

00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:42,940
What?

679
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,300

690
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:53,980
Uh.

691
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,260

694
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,520
How do I do act.

695
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:02,720
Oh.

696
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:02,820
There it is.

697
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,840
All right.

718
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,160

719
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:30,980

Yeah.

741
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,120
Some people have an aura.

742
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:55,480
You have an aura.

743
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:55,900
That's crazy.

744
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,600
It's not that that's bad.

745
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,080
You know.

746
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,300
No.

747
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,200
The handle was just like.

748
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:00,660
Mom.

749
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,860
She's eating a taco.

750
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:05,480
She's eating a taco right now.

751
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,120
I just made a carne asada taco.

752
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:09,420
Oh.

753
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:09,640
Shit.

754
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,440
Whoa.

755
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,560
Taco is not sweet.

756
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,500
I mean.

757
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,640
Oh my god.

758
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,420
I'm sorry for putting the lord's name in vain.

759
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,780
Uncle baby Billy.

760
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,080
Can people still hear me?

761
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:30,540
Yeah.

762
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:30,780
Yeah.

763
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,500
We can hear you.

764
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:31,740
Yeah.

765
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,800
Oh this is awesome.

766
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:32,800
Oh!

767
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,840
There's a cutscene?

768
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,940
Oh my god!

769
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,760
1984!

770
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,600
Oh my god, the bite!

771
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,860
That's where Josh was born!

772
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,500
The bite of 1984!

773
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,680
Hello everybody!

774
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:52,080
Welcome back to Five Nights at Freddy's Indie Horror Game.

775
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,280
How do we skip this cutscene?

776
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,920
We don't need lore?

777
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:13,450
Oh my god!

778
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:15,890
It's so elaborate!

779
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,270
It's okay, the round hasn't started yet, guys!

780
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,510
We're fine!

781
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:27,670
The moment the round started, then we do it.

782
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:51,090
Who are these people?

783
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:56,750
The thing is, I don't know if these guys can hear me when I'm talking right now.

784
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:57,970
Because I have push...

785
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:58,870
Okay, I don't think they can.

786
00:29:58,950 --> 00:29:59,670
Because no one said anything.

787
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:01,050
To me.

788
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,430
No one said, like, shut the heck up.

789
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:08,690
It's as if nobody can hear me.

790
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:15,370
So I had to pause and be like, okay, wait, I can't swear.

791
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:19,050
Yeah, I'm gonna probably say something.

792
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:23,490
No, I'm on voice activation because I got lazy.

793
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,690
Oh my god, chicken!

794
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,700
We put wood, town, September 3rd.

795
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,860
I have no idea what is going on.

796
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:01,360
Like, where did the haunted house come in?

797
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,920
Like, when does that come into play?

798
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,920
Oh, is that the house?

799
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,760
Oh no, that's the house!

800
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:27,450
Yeah, I know, but like, I'm just like, thinking...

801
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:30,010
Oh my god, this is like a debut stream.

802
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:33,270
The lore video that's like 15, 20 minutes long.

803
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:39,190
We're watching a VTuber debut now.

804
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:55,110
Oh, we're like news reporters!

805
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:57,650
They sent in like a hundred and fifteen...

806
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:00,390
What the heck?

807
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:01,210
What is...

808
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:06,370
They sent in a hundred and fifteen news reporters to get in the...

809
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:09,910
To figure out what's going on in the haunted house.

810
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:15,270
We need every inch.

811
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:15,530
We need every angle.

812
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:19,670
Yeah, we sent in a hundred and fifty.

813
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,150
One of them will go viral.

814
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:34,400
Even like five news car...

815
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,720
Wait, is it like one person per car?

816
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,360
Okay, now that's excessive.

817
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,840
Each news reporter brought in their own car.

818
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:55,080
Who cares about global warming?

819
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:59,160
They don't know about carpooling.

820
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,620
The CO2 emissions go crazy.

821
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,440
Oh, what the heck?

822
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,240
There's ghosts?

823
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,480
There's ghosts?

824
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,420
Oh my god!

825
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,760
It's so spooky!

826
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,720
Why are you here?

827
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,860
I'm here to report the news.

828
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,580
I'm here to represent BBC News.

829
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,680
Oh, there's 46... Oh, sweet!

830
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,760
Four people already got eliminated.

831
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,740
I mean, sucks for them, but...

832
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,720
Did you see that?

833
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,060
Four people already got eliminated!

834
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,640
I don't have permission to speak?

835
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,820
Yeah, you guys are in my mind.

836
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,400
I don't have permission to speak.

837
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,660
Silence, Tokyo!

838
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,160
No!

839
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,880
They actually silenced us!

840
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,940
Oh, we can talk now!

841
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,980
I can hear you guys!

842
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,060
Oh my god!

843
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,800
I thought they silenced us.

844
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,720
They just trauma dumped on us.

845
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,120
Yeah.

846
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,740
So, are we like news reporters here?

847
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,820
150 news reporters?

848
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:47,900
I think so.

849
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:48,360
I think so.

850
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,060
I guess so.

851
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,080
I think we're the TV people.

852
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,240
I think we're the TV people.

853
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:51,800
Oh my god.

854
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:52,200
There's...

855
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,120
It's like that...

856
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,860
You guys wanna see this hiding spot I found?

857
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:56,760
Oh yeah.

858
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,500
If you're just seeking...

859
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,000
Oh my god.

860
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,500
It's like that Will Ferrell movie where they send in all the news reporters to fight.

861
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,160
It's just like that Will Ferrell movie.

862
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,520
It's so dark up here.

863
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:08,980
Yeah, yeah.

864
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,800
If there's hide and seek, Gumi found the perfect spot.

865
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,820
They can't see us for face.

866
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:15,940
Woah!

867
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:16,680
Oh!

868
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:18,340
Oh!

869
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:18,660
Oh no!

870
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,220
I didn't have emotes only mode!

871
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,220
Where are my mods?

872
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,000
Can I

873
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:26,660
look at this?

874
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,400
Oh yeah, sure.

875
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,460
Yeah, of course.

876
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:28,500
Yeah.

877
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:35,700
Okay, but I'm like a baby though, so... Wait, can I get promoted to wife number two if I play Valorant with you?

878
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,260
You'll get promoted to my one and only...

879
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,680
Okay, absolutely then.

880
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:41,920
One and only?

881
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,180
Okay, wait.

882
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:44,880
I need to promote...

883
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,640
How do I put mod only mode?

884
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,820
How do I put mod only mode?

885
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:51,900
Guys, I don't know how to do it.

886
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,000
Guys!

887
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,580
Wait, wait.

888
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,220
Emote.

889
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:57,920
Okay, I'm gonna message.

890
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:04,140
Can you help me put on emote only mode on my stream?

891
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:04,860
Sorry.

892
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:05,880
Caps.

893
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,420
It's okay.

894
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,440
I personally messaged a mod to show up.

895
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,860
Because I'm still... I'm a bit late.

896
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:22,000
Yeah, but what if you don't make it to the round to do this?

897
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:23,840
Well...

898
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,140
Oh yeah.

899
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,700
FruBears, if you got to the finals, you gotta split 60-40.

900
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,060
Well, it's gonna be 60-20-20.

901
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:35,820
Oh, true.

902
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,900
60-20-20.

903
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,800
So I get 60 and you two get 20.

904
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,220
Got it.

905
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,320
Yeah.

906
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,280
Yeah.

907
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,220
Yeah, so like if FruBears win first place...

908
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,960
And because we showed him the god spot.

909
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,200
Yeah, that seems fair.

910
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:51,840
Yeah.

911
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,720
I'll give away all my money.

912
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,360
I think that's pretty fair.

913
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,940
You have Minecraft money.

914
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,000
You don't need $70,000.

915
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,220
You said I got Minecraft money?

916
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,420
Yeah, you got Minecraft money.

917
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:11,680
I bet $70,000 to you is like an apple.

918
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,060
That's a lot.

919
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,080
Dude,

920
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,020
I just finished my two tacos.

921
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,280
It was so freaking good.

922
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,080
Ooh.

923
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,100
Yumbo.

924
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,520
I guess...

925
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:32,500
It was tiny and sour tacos with salsa verde and...

926
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,220
Ooh.

927
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,100
Ooh, that sounds so good.

928
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,240
My goodness gracious.

929
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,240
I'm so like...

930
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:38,880
Salivating.

931
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:39,580
Are we...

932
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:43,220
After two minutes and 30 seconds, do we get like TP to the first game?

933
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:43,860
We die.

934
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,480
We die.

935
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,100
Okay, because I'm going to be like...

936
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:49,500
It'll be a bit awkward if like we're supposed to head to the place or something.

937
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,360
Maybe.

938
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,160
Because we're like, you have two minutes.

939
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,220
No, everybody's gone.

940
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,420
That's the spooky part.

941
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,520
Uh-oh.

942
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:58,740
Everybody's missing.

943
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,320
A lot of people are disconnected.

944
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,720
A lot of people are disconnected to fix their voice.

945
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,320
Oh.

946
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,120
Okay.

947
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,420
No, no, there's people up front.

948
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:06,720
Okay.

949
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:07,520
Nice.

950
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,320
Six people already got eliminated.

951
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,080
So like...

952
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,080
Before the games even started.

953
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,040
So we have a chance.

954
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,340
Yippee.

955
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,040
Yay!

956
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:19,940
Yay!

957
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,860
I feel like we should have...

958
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:26,160
Inside.

959
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,320
Oh yeah, yeah.

960
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,280
We didn't explore inside.

961
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,720
We only went to like one room.

962
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,460
We only had...

963
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,080
Explored one room and that was it.

964
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:35,500
Yeah.

965
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,340
That's not coffee.

966
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,120
Bloody fast man.

967
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:38,860
Bloody fast man.

968
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,140
Do you see the things I see in my mind?

969
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,200
Why do you say hi to?

970
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,980
Oh my god, there's a skull.

971
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,120
Oh my god.

972
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,700
There's a couple of friends over there too.

973
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:49,480
Yeah!

974
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,460
I'm kind of scared.

975
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,860
What if we go in this room and our voices start lagging again?

976
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:56,660
Oh my god.

977
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,520
No, it's already starting.

978
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,080
Oh shit, there's so many people.

979
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,220
Doki, run!

980
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,240
Doki, run!

981
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,220
Doki, run!

982
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:08,540
Quick!

983
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,300
We gotta get our bandwidth back, Gumi!

984
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,860
We gotta get our bandwidth!

985
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,240
No, man.

986
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,360
It's Gumi.

987
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,360
Get that through your head.

988
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,660
Doki and Gumi.

989
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,700
Call me Doki.

990
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:24,400
Yeah.

991
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,340
Gumi.

992
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,120
Look, it's two bears!

993
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,600
Oh my god, bears unite!

994
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,200
I'm a bear farmer.

995
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:34,460
Oh, what is that?

996
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,060
Oh, what did I just watch?

997
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:36,920
Do you farm bears?

998
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,000
Yeah, I farm bears.

999
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:38,800
I farm you.

1000
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,060
Alright,

1001
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:48,840
let's head over.

1002
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,680
We gotta get our bandwidth back.

1003
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:53,520
Alright, guys.

1004
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,620
I still...

1005
00:39:54,620 --> 00:40:00,260
I still don't have... I have zero mods on my... It's an anarchy right now in my chat.

1006
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,220
What?

1007
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:06,540
There's... None of the mods are online today for me.

1008
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,600
That's crazy.

1009
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,920
It's not looking so...

1010
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:11,480
Oh, no!

1011
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:12,700
Doki!

1012
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,260
We got VZed!

1013
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,640
Oh, we're together!

1014
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:18,840
Hold my hand!

1015
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,180
Gumi!

1016
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,500
Oh, no.

1017
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,280
I'm scared.

1018
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,400
Oh, no!

1019
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:38,900
Oh, no!

1020
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:39,880
I need to push the top!

1021
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,780
I need to push the top!

1022
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,380
Oh, no!

1023
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,060
There's so many people!

1024
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,280
Okay.

1025
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,040
Wait.

1026
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,140
Wait.

1027
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,480
Where?

1028
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,140
There's too many people.

1029
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:52,800
I can't!

1030
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,960
I can't tap out to Doshimo Only Mode!

1031
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,380
Where... Where's my mod?

1032
00:40:59,260 --> 00:40:59,820
It's...

1033
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,480
I'm gonna have to go and check for my time.

1034
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,720
Where's my mod?

1035
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,320
I don't see it!

1036
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:07,860
I don't see it!

1037
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:08,640
I'm scared!

1038
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,460
I'm trying to find Gumi!

1039
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,200
Okay, I think I have time.

1040
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,060
I have time to start Emo Only Mode.

1041
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:20,520
Emo Only Mode here.

1042
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,860
If I tap out, I think I have time.

1043
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:23,640
Okay.

1044
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,680
Where was it?

1045
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,000
Okay.

1046
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,260
There you go.

1047
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:29,980
No!

1048
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,460
I can't because I...

1049
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:31,560
Oh,

1050
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,800
it's...

1051
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,800
I can't!

1052
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:41,880
I can't!

1053
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:44,600
Oh, no!

1054
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:45,940
Oh, no!

1055
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,980
The time started.

1056
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,640
Oh, no!

1057
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,540
Oh, no!

1058
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,160
Just...

1059
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,100
I can't!

1060
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,520
None of my mods are on!

1061
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,000
Oh, no!

1062
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:58,740
It started!

1063
00:41:59,140 --> 00:41:59,420
What?

1064
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,620
Oh, wait.

1065
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,520
Everything's quiet now.

1066
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:03,780
Oh, thank God!

1067
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:04,700
Oh, thank God!

1068
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,220
But where's Gumi?

1069
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,640
Where's Gumi?

1070
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,300
She was gonna put me on her backpack!

1071
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:11,860
Oh, no!

1072
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,420
Oh, Emo Only Mode is on!

1073
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:16,860
I don't know where my mod was that put it on, but thank you!

1074
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:19,860
We didn't...

1075
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:21,100
We didn't get...

1076
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:21,840
Oh, my God.

1077
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:22,220
Not a bear!

1078
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,620
Oh, my God!

1079
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,400
Bears unite!

1080
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,700
Where is she?

1081
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:30,640
Friends!

1082
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:31,980
Where...

1083
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:32,580
Where's...

1084
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,160
Oh, wait.

1085
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,800
It's like four minutes until we start?

1086
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,420
I assume so, right?

1087
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:40,080
I assume it's like four minutes till we start.

1088
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:40,760
Oh, no!

1089
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,000
I hope so.

1090
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,100
Oh, like, did they...

1091
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,400
Did the voice chat just got DC'd for everybody?

1092
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,320
I think it did.

1093
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:55,260
I think they shut down the voice chat for everybody!

1094
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:00,520
Nobody's talking.

1095
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,820
Oh, my God.

1096
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,260
I see a lot of, like, disconnected right now.

1097
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:06,460
Well...

1098
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,480
Can't have you guys tell...

1099
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,340
You guys can't tell me what's actually going on.

1100
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,080
Because it's emote only.

1101
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,980
I can't believe it.

1102
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:16,320
Where people are!

1103
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,120
Where people at?!

1104
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,780
There's so many Minecraft skins.

1105
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:23,540
There's...

1106
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:28,620
There's no way 150 people are right here right now.

1107
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,500
That's a lot of people.

1108
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:32,040
Oh my God.

1109
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,520
There's so many actual Minecraft players.

1110
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,260
Because they have the Creeper cape.

1111
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:36,140
Right?

1112
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,840
The cape means that you are like, an OG player right?

1113
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,820
I actually don't know.

1114
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:45,240
I don't know much about the Minecraft lore.

1115
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:50,460
You guys can't even fact check me because you're all on emote mode!

1116
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,940
You guys can't... I can't even get fact checked!

1117
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,940
Because you're all on emote mode!

1118
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:00,180
No!

1119
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:06,240
That means I can say the most ridiculous things and nobody can stop me.

1120
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,720
Nobody can be like, I'm actually me.

1121
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:10,900
Oh my god.

1122
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,140
How do I fucking...

1123
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:16,400
How do I fucking banter when my entire chat is just emojis?

1124
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,740
Like it's talking to a kindergartner.

1125
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,960
Still trying to find people.

1126
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,180
Wait, it just went back to five minutes.

1127
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:24,880
It reset.

1128
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:26,880
It reset itself.

1129
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,500
I'm so confused.

1130
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,720
I can't be like, hey guys!

1131
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:37,200
Are people hearing anything?

1132
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,020
On like the other streams?

1133
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:46,840
Or did everybody else's voice chat also crashed?

1134
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:48,640
Or like doesn't work anymore?

1135
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,740
I can't say... I can't ask you guys.

1136
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,160
But...

1137
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:55,400
Start where...

1138
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,680
Countdown will restart once disconnected.

1139
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:01,020
Start where it left off.

1140
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:01,800
Oh!

1141
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:02,160
Oh!

1142
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,020
So am I supposed to reconnect?

1143
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,680
Because the voice chat's off?

1144
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,960
Oh, maybe like...

1145
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,520
Oh, maybe like it crashed itself.

1146
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:12,220
Okay.

1147
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:13,780
So do I have to reconnect?

1148
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:15,220
I'm scared of reconnecting.

1149
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:18,580
I guess I can reconnect, right?

1150
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,620
I don't know.

1151
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:20,660
I DON'T KNOW!

1152
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,080
BECAUSE YOU GUYS CAN'T TALK TO ME!

1153
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,580
I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD RECONNECT!

1154
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:28,580
Guys!

1155
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:29,540
Yay or nay?

1156
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:30,300
Recon...

1157
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,500
Do I reconnect?

1158
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:35,460
Yay for get... log out?

1159
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:36,360
Reconnect?

1160
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,440
Nay for like...

1161
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,160
Don't reconnect?

1162
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:42,020
Guys...

1163
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:43,000
I mean...

1164
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,400
Yay or nay, guys?

1165
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:46,460
I DON'T KNOW!

1166
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:50,320
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON!

1167
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:52,400
Okay.

1168
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,880
Please do not dis...

1169
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:56,160
Oh!

1170
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:57,540
OH!

1171
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:58,400
Okay, nevermind.

1172
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,500
Admin stopped me.

1173
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,400
Nevermind.

1174
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:03,700
Okay.

1175
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,460
JK, I don't need your help.

1176
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:08,520
The admin stopped me before I could do anything.

1177
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:11,500
Thank God.

1178
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,080
I was about to...

1179
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,220
I was about to do it.

1180
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,300
There's just so many skins here.

1181
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,600
I didn't realize there were a lot of bears.

1182
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,780
There's actually a lot of like big Minecraft players.

1183
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:27,840
Isn't Tubbo like a really famous Minecraft streamer?

1184
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:31,540
Oh, and I was just like...

1185
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:32,580
Look at this guy.

1186
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,120
I'm like trying to find...

1187
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:39,820
Trying to find...

1188
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:40,560
Oh, he is!

1189
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:42,620
Oh, shit.

1190
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:44,340
Oh my God.

1191
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,480
I can't believe it.

1192
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,000
I'm a true Minecraft player now.

1193
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,060
I'm basically a Minecraft player.

1194
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,740
Is that Elmo in a fucking bikini?

1195
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:58,420
But we can't say fuck.

1196
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,620
Wait, that's...

1197
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,160
Elmo in a bikini.

1198
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,860
But we can't swear.

1199
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:10,520
I'm like...

1200
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:13,280
I've been trying to find Kumi this entire time.

1201
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,760
And I can't.

1202
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:17,360
I found so many other people.

1203
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,180
Oh, there's Rosadoodle.

1204
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,220
I know her.

1205
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:25,160
She's a Vtuber.

1206
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:29,120
Let's see.

1207
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,980
I'm just slowly moving through the queue.

1208
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,140
Moving through the queue.

1209
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:36,080
Right now.

1210
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,620
To see if I can find her.

1211
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:40,120
Like, I mean, six people have already been eliminated.

1212
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:41,780
So...

1213
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:42,400
Wait, no.

1214
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:43,040
Eight people.

1215
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:43,860
Right?

1216
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:45,520
Eight people have already been eliminated.

1217
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:46,840
So like...

1218
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:47,980
At best, like...

1219
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:49,380
As long as I'm not like...

1220
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,280
The 15...

1221
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,700
As long as I'm not like...

1222
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:54,920
As bad as like 15 other players...

1223
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,200
I should win this.

1224
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,460
Why are there people in this corner?

1225
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,840
Like, that's really it.

1226
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:05,840
Oh, wait.

1227
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:07,520
Oh my god!

1228
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,660
I found her!

1229
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,460
I did it, guys.

1230
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:14,440
We did it.

1231
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,500
We found each other.

1232
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:18,340
Now she can carry me.

1233
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:19,820
I'm gonna use...

1234
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:23,960
I'm gonna use her friendship with all the other Minecraft players to make sure I don't die as well.

1235
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,340
And I'm just the trophy wife.

1236
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:32,720
I'm the trophy wife, yeah.

1237
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,380
Gumi will save me.

1238
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:43,160
Because all the other Minecraft players would be like...

1239
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:43,700
Oh my god!

1240
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:44,640
Gumi!

1241
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:45,660
You're a friend!

1242
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,200
So we won't kill you!

1243
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,660
And then they'll see me next to Gumi.

1244
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,340
And they'll be like...

1245
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:49,840
Oh my god!

1246
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:50,820
You're Gumi's wife!

1247
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:51,980
We won't kill you!

1248
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:52,520
And I'm like...

1249
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:52,940
Oh, thank god.

1250
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:56,260
No...

1251
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:57,580
Thank god.

1252
00:48:58,180 --> 00:48:59,220
Protection by association.

1253
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,420
I'm gonna get protection here.

1254
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:04,400
Alright.

1255
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:06,800
Yay!

1256
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,820
Should we be at the starting line?

1257
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:10,640
Come on, Gumi!

1258
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:12,180
Gumi, come on!

1259
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:13,580
Gumi!

1260
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:15,480
Come on!

1261
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,500
We gotta go to the starting line, Gumi!

1262
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,920
There's 40 seconds left!

1263
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:23,380
They're gonna have a head start, Gumi!

1264
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,300
Oh no.

1265
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,120
Come on, Gumi!

1266
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,300
I need the bodyguide protection.

1267
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:31,500
Come on!

1268
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,980
What are you doing just standing there?

1269
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:35,700
I don't know if they're gonna TPS or not!

1270
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:37,760
Oh no.

1271
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,260
I don't know if they'll TPS.

1272
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:42,320
I don't know if I should have to find her again.

1273
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,580
What if I need to find her again?

1274
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:49,140
It's so like...

1275
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:49,940
What's the word?

1276
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:53,200
It's so creepy when there's literally no sound.

1277
00:49:56,820 --> 00:50:00,240
There's like no sound at all and it's so fucking creepy.

1278
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:05,990
Oh, it's another cutscene.

1279
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:07,550
Let's fucking go.

1280
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:09,290
Welcome to the house of nightmares.

1281
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:14,330
You all came here as journalists to test the theories...

1282
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:16,810
We are news reporters!

1283
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:20,990
You should now understand that the legend is true.

1284
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:22,870
150 news reporters.

1285
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:26,150
And now it is you who will be tested.

1286
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:28,690
Representing BBC News.

1287
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:33,670
Our wicked conjurer has put forth a series of challenging nightmares, each of which...

1288
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:34,910
No, I should be PBS Kids!

1289
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:36,810
...for a certain number of you.

1290
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:39,310
Should you fail...

1291
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:40,690
Representing PBS Kids.

1292
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:43,450
...your soul will remain in the house of nightmares forever.

1293
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:48,050
Look, kids need to have news reporters as well.

1294
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:51,990
...and your life depends on your ability to succeed in them.

1295
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:54,730
Lights out.

1296
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:56,970
The first nightmare is called Lights Out.

1297
00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:02,230
To survive, you must traverse a long path to the safe zone.

1298
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:04,650
As you progress...

1299
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:06,950
...the lights will turn off and on randomly.

1300
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:11,690
When the lights turn off, the spirits can see you moving.

1301
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:13,790
So you must stay complete.

1302
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:15,190
That's why you have to stay still.

1303
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:18,650
You can resume movement once the lights come back on.

1304
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,560
That's spooky.

1305
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:27,540
You can find ability boxes scattered around the environment.

1306
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,080
What do the boxes look like?

1307
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:32,760
Purple ability boxes will give you an advantage over other players.

1308
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:37,360
The abilities could be a three-second speed boost potion...

1309
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,980
Oh, it is like Mario Kart!

1310
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:44,380
...or a snowball that can freeze an opponent you hit for three seconds.

1311
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:48,460
It is basically like Mario Kart.

1312
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:50,960
If you move while the lights are out...

1313
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,180
...you will find yourself haunted by the spirits...

1314
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:57,740
...and momentarily unable to move.

1315
00:51:58,060 --> 00:51:59,400
Okay, at least you don't die.

1316
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:01,860
A timer will count down until you can move again.

1317
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:05,920
This is a race to the safe zone.

1318
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:09,120
Only 140 of you will pass.

1319
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:14,300
This means that 10 of you will meet your final ending here today.

1320
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:14,620
Oh, wait!

1321
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,020
That means two people will get eliminated!

1322
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,020
Okay, now...

1323
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:19,800
I don't want to jinx myself...

1324
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:23,900
...but, like, if I am one of the two people that get eliminated...

1325
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:26,080
...I'm just never playing Minecraft again.

1326
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:34,220
If I'm literally one of the two people that just get eliminated...

1327
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:36,300
...I'll be so fucking sad!

1328
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:39,420
Literally!

1329
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:45,480
Like, there's 142 people...

1330
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,140
...and I'll be so...

1331
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:50,140
...I'll be actually depressed if I get eliminated.

1332
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:54,080
Oh my god, please!

1333
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,140
Don't let me be the two!

1334
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,700
Don't let me be one of the two!

1335
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:05,240
That's all I want!

1336
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,480
I'll actually uninstall this game!

1337
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,540
Then I become one of them!

1338
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,360
Oh my god!

1339
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:14,500
Okay.

1340
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:15,760
30 seconds.

1341
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:16,080
Woah!

1342
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:17,700
Woah!

1343
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:19,920
Oh my god!

1344
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:21,680
They enabled voice chat again.

1345
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:23,200
And then they...

1346
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,660
...disabled voice chat?

1347
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:30,680
I like how they enabled...

1348
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:32,780
Guys!

1349
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:34,140
Okay!

1350
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:35,820
Okay, I don't like that.

1351
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,500
I don't like that.

1352
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:41,740
They should have not enabled voice chat there.

1353
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:43,820
When we're all pipes down.

1354
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:45,100
Okay.

1355
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:45,440
Okay.

1356
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,300
Oh my...

1357
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,780
I can barely see the fucking light!

1358
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:51,460
Oh!

1359
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:54,680
Oh.

1360
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:56,620
Oh.

1361
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:59,140
Oh my god!

1362
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,600
Oh my gosh.

1363
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:01,350
Okay.

1364
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:02,260
Okay.

1365
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:04,120
I can't see the fucking light!

1366
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:06,440
It's terrifying...

1367
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:07,240
It's a big one!

1368
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:08,460
It's terrifying!

1369
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:08,580
Oh my...

1370
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:09,660
Follow the crowd!

1371
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:10,980
This is terrifying.

1372
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:11,980
Follow the crowd!

1373
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:13,860
I'm not a Jew anymore!

1374
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:14,300
Oh my gosh.

1375
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:15,340
They're believing us!

1376
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:15,640
Okay.

1377
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:17,240
Yeah!

1378
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:19,120
See you later, nerds!

1379
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:22,020
See you later!

1380
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,260
I won't be in the show always!

1381
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:25,360
Okay!

1382
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:26,280
Okay.

1383
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:28,320
That's fine.

1384
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:32,000
Slowly passing by the people that got knocked out.

1385
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:33,700
That's the only way you can get out.

1386
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:33,980
That's the only way you can get out.

1387
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:34,040
That's the only way you can get out.

1388
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:34,100
That's the only way you can get out.

1389
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:35,380
Get f**ked.

1390
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:36,960
Get f**ked!

1391
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:44,240
No, don't talk, please.

1392
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:45,160
I'm already overwhelmed.

1393
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:48,520
I'm already overwhelmed and don't talk, guys!

1394
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:49,680
Don't talk!

1395
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:56,820
This is so scary.

1396
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,520
Oh my god, this is so scary.

1397
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,980
Please, I can't see anything!

1398
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,300
Move away from me!

1399
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,140
I can barely...

1400
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:10,440
Oh god!

1401
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:13,420
Oh god, move!

1402
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:14,940
I can't see anything!

1403
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:22,260
Oh god, I need to get away from everybody.

1404
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,900
I need to make sure I'm not bunched up.

1405
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,460
Because I really can't see anything.

1406
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:29,640
Okay.

1407
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:30,900
Nice.

1408
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,420
Yeah, get f**ked, loser.

1409
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:35,240
I mean, get f**ked, loser.

1410
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:42,360
Okay, we're okay.

1411
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:45,760
Okay, there's no way we can be the bottom two.

1412
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:48,040
We didn't get frozen once, guys.

1413
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:50,000
There's no way.

1414
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:51,520
There's...

1415
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,260
We're like, almost in the front.

1416
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,260
How are they faster?

1417
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,140
I don't understand.

1418
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:03,200
How are they so fast, the people in the front?

1419
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,760
Like, I'm be...

1420
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:06,740
We're moving the same speed!

1421
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:08,240
I could do that.

1422
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:09,900
We're...

1423
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:13,160
We're doing the same speed!

1424
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:14,860
Is there like a bunny hop tech?

1425
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:18,440
Guys, I can't even ask you guys if you know what the bunny hop tech is.

1426
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:19,160
Because...

1427
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:23,700
What's the bunny hop...

1428
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:25,500
What's the bunny hop tech?

1429
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,440
These goddamn Minecraft players.

1430
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,720
Okay, guys, so...

1431
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:37,520
These goddamn Minecraft players and their bee hop tech.

1432
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,120
Jesus Christ!

1433
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:41,480
Oh, but there's a little shortcut here.

1434
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:42,460
Don't go that way.

1435
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:43,920
Don't go that way?

1436
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:45,960
What do you mean, don't go that way?

1437
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,580
Where do you go?

1438
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:50,740
Where do you go, though?

1439
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,000
Oh my gosh.

1440
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:52,480
Oh.

1441
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:53,740
Okay, okay, okay.

1442
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:55,560
Alright, follow the crowd!

1443
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:56,520
Follow the crowd!

1444
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,220
Follow the crowd!

1445
00:56:58,260 --> 00:56:58,660
Follow the crowd!

1446
00:56:58,660 --> 00:56:59,360
We shall see you guys.

1447
00:56:59,360 --> 00:56:59,900
Oh!

1448
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:00,240
Oh!

1449
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:01,260
Oh!

1450
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:01,700
Oh!

1451
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:01,840
Oh!

1452
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:01,940
Oh!

1453
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:04,280
Oh my gosh!

1454
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:06,200
Still surviving!

1455
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:08,080
Still surviving!

1456
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,820
I'm just like the Minecraft players!

1457
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:11,400
I'm just like them!

1458
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:12,800
Okay.

1459
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:13,880
Oh my gosh.

1460
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,020
I just left them.

1461
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:16,960
I should have been frozen.

1462
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,000
Okay, here we go.

1463
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:18,220
Yeah.

1464
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,640
Oh my god, guys.

1465
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:21,540
Maybe I should be in Minecraft now.

1466
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:23,900
Okay, I see.

1467
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,220
I almost thought I got hit.

1468
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,720
I almost thought I got hit.

1469
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:26,960
Tone!

1470
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,000
Okay.

1471
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,000
Oh, nice, we passed by people.

1472
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,600
We just passed... yeah, that's what you get for getting too cocky there!

1473
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:37,640
I can't see!

1474
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:38,800
I can't see!

1475
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,600
I can't see!

1476
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:43,640
I can't see!

1477
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:44,300
I can't see, it's just names!

1478
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:48,000
It's just names!

1479
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:51,400
Wait!

1480
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:56,420
I got blocked by 200!

1481
00:57:57,380 --> 00:58:00,020
I got blocked by 200 people there!

1482
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:03,660
Oh god, please, please!

1483
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,260
Don't mic spam!

1484
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:06,520
Please!

1485
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:07,980
I beg of you!

1486
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,240
Oh god.

1487
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:12,620
Okay.

1488
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:14,980
We're okay, we're okay.

1489
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:19,700
No, no, no, what are you talking about?

1490
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:21,340
Where is the safe zone?

1491
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,520
How is it that far?

1492
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,300
There's still so much more to go!

1493
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:31,500
There's still so much more to go!

1494
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:34,300
I could barely take in the surroundings!

1495
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:37,840
It's just people!

1496
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,400
All I see are people!

1497
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,820
All I see are people!

1498
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:48,400
All I see are people!

1499
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,080
Oh, nice.

1500
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:51,220
Nice.

1501
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:53,360
We're almost there.

1502
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:55,800
We're almost there.

1503
00:58:57,460 --> 00:58:57,940
Oh!

1504
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,480
Please, please don't!

1505
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,160
Nice, nice, nice.

1506
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:03,300
No one crossed the finish line.

1507
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,420
I actually don't even know we're almost there.

1508
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:09,340
I just feel like I've been running forever, chat.

1509
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:12,080
I just feel like I've been running forever, chat.

1510
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:13,360
I've been running for so long.

1511
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:14,840
I've been running for so long.

1512
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:16,220
There's no way!

1513
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:18,740
There's nobody at the safe zone!

1514
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:20,220
Not even the front of the pack!

1515
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:23,720
I think this is the first 50%.

1516
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:25,660
I think this is the first 50%.

1517
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:26,100
I think...

1518
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:28,320
Nobody's at the safe zone yet!

1519
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:28,760
Okay.

1520
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:31,480
Please.

1521
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:34,800
Please, somebody hit the safe zone.

1522
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:36,080
Please, I beg of you.

1523
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:37,360
Somebody, please!

1524
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:39,260
So I know what it's...

1525
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:41,320
So I know if the end is near!

1526
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,200
That's all I want!

1527
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:47,060
Is the end near yet?

1528
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:50,380
Is the end near yet?

1529
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:52,320
Oh my god.

1530
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:56,560
Is there still people?

1531
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:59,460
How is there still more?

1532
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:08,040
How the hell is there still more?

1533
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:11,460
Alright.

1534
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:12,500
Nice.

1535
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,820
All I'm saying is I haven't been hit once yet.

1536
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:20,640
I haven't been hit by the ghost yet, guys.

1537
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:22,300
I haven't been hit by the ghost yet, guys.

1538
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:23,200
I'm practically gaming.

1539
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:26,320
Get shit on.

1540
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:29,740
Look at all these people sitting down.

1541
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,440
That's the only thing I could hear.

1542
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:39,420
Oh my god.

1543
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:41,020
They're so in the front.

1544
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:48,480
I don't understand how the moving thing actually hits.

1545
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,060
I feel like I should have been hit several times.

1546
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:52,400
Oh god.

1547
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,380
I like how nobody's getting the box.

1548
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:57,940
Or like, the box...

1549
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:00,460
Only the front people can get the box right now.

1550
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:03,240
So like, I have not been hit once.

1551
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:04,980
I have not hit the box once.

1552
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:07,520
Lucky, are we in last place right now?

1553
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:07,920
Where are we?

1554
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:12,080
We have to be in the middle of the pack.

1555
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:13,500
Yes!

1556
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:15,320
That's how it is!

1557
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:16,720
Are you serious?

1558
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:17,040
Oh, okay.

1559
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:19,260
I'm too scared.

1560
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:21,020
Coward, coward.

1561
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:22,980
Now I know why.

1562
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:23,960
Now I know why they're in the front.

1563
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:24,780
Yes!

1564
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,100
I'm speeding now!

1565
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:32,600
Okay, I'm speeding, but yet she's still in the front.

1566
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,980
Like, what is this fucking bullshit?

1567
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:43,780
I'm speeding, yet I'm still not fasting.

1568
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:50,900
Okay, I got snowballed.

1569
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:53,000
Oh, I messed up!

1570
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:55,280
No, I missed!

1571
01:01:56,010 --> 01:01:56,560
What the hell?

1572
01:01:58,660 --> 01:01:59,940
What is that?

1573
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:00,780
What?

1574
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:05,260
You slowed me!

1575
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:08,240
You slowed me!

1576
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:09,100
I'm a crushing Again?

1577
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:10,600
You didn't do anything.

1578
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:12,400
I slowed me!

1579
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:14,960
Okay.

1580
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:19,440
They hit into...

1581
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:20,620
No!

1582
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:21,580
Please!

1583
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:23,400
Please!

1584
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:25,800
How is there still more?

1585
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:28,360
You do it first!

1586
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:29,360
You do it first!

1587
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:30,560
Oh no...

1588
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:34,000
There's still more of this map!

1589
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:40,800
I feel like I've been running for like 10 years.

1590
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,260
I don't understand.

1591
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:46,360
No one's at the safe zone!

1592
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:50,560
We got this.

1593
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:51,120
We got this.

1594
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:51,760
We can do this.

1595
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:53,600
Nobody's there!

1596
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:56,220
Oh my god.

1597
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:57,800
I got frozen.

1598
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:59,220
Is this the safe zone?

1599
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:00,160
No, it's not!

1600
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:03,080
What the fuck?

1601
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:04,140
Did you just hear that?

1602
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:07,000
Someone just said you need to be here.

1603
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:07,900
Oh my god, I'm shaking.

1604
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,240
Oh my god, my freaking heart.

1605
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:10,120
Oh my god.

1606
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:11,620
I'm shaking too, but it's because of the comedy.

1607
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:12,540
Save!

1608
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:14,180
A little bit of a fucked up.

1609
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:15,380
Oh, I'm anxious.

1610
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:15,900
I'm anxious.

1611
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:16,360
I'm anxious.

1612
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:16,380
Okay.

1613
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:18,680
Bro, I'm just trying to exist.

1614
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:22,180
I'm just trying to exist, guys.

1615
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,560
I haven't been hit once.

1616
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:27,640
I haven't been hit once.

1617
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:28,500
There's no way.

1618
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:29,660
You're in my face, agency!

1619
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:34,180
I have no idea.

1620
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:37,680
I have no idea left or right.

1621
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:42,500
Okay, where you going?

1622
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:44,840
Okay, I'm going left.

1623
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:45,620
Okay.

1624
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:47,300
I'm going left.

1625
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:47,980
I'm going left.

1626
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:50,000
I trust left side.

1627
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,460
Left side seems like they know what they're doing.

1628
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,360
I trust the left.

1629
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,360
That's a bad connotation, Fax.

1630
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:57,980
Oh, please, guys.

1631
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:00,740
I'm going left.

1632
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:01,640
This is...

1633
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:04,840
If it's not left, we're so fucked.

1634
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:06,360
What the fuck?

1635
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:10,000
No, left or right.

1636
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:11,340
I hate making decisions.

1637
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:12,240
I want that.

1638
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:12,620
I want that.

1639
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:12,840
Oh.

1640
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:14,680
Well, I would've done that.

1641
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:14,920
Okay.

1642
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:16,520
Wait, I didn't even get that.

1643
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:17,620
Who the heck got it?

1644
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:18,960
Wait, I'm scared.

1645
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:19,560
I'm so sad.

1646
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:21,020
I'm so sad.

1647
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:22,420
I got pinged so hard.

1648
01:04:22,620 --> 01:04:23,560
Where is the server?

1649
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,860
The server is not on West Coast.

1650
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:27,680
I got pinged so hard.

1651
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:29,840
I hit somebody!

1652
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,160
Okay, nice.

1653
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:32,300
Alright.

1654
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:34,600
This is not fair.

1655
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:35,840
This is a ping diff.

1656
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:38,400
The ping diff messed me over.

1657
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:39,900
Goodbye.

1658
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:40,820
Goodbye.

1659
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:42,040
Oh.

1660
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:44,140
Dude, I messed up.

1661
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:44,680
I messed up.

1662
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:45,220
Alright.

1663
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:46,580
Please.

1664
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:49,540
The moment I see people leading into the...

1665
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:50,140
This is a safe zone.

1666
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:51,680
I know the moment.

1667
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:52,560
Oh god.

1668
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:55,660
The moment I know it's almost over.

1669
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:02,820
It's still going.

1670
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,380
This is a mile run.

1671
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:08,360
It's literally the mile run.

1672
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:12,240
It was out of panic.

1673
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:13,200
Hi, Lexi.

1674
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:13,860
We're still okay.

1675
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:14,500
We're still okay.

1676
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:15,600
Lexi.

1677
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:16,040
We're still okay.

1678
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:17,680
Lexi murdered me.

1679
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:18,500
What?

1680
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:20,400
Okay, not gonna lie.

1681
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:21,800
We should eliminate more than 10 people.

1682
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:22,940
Guys, are we in the bottom 10?

1683
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:23,440
Be honest.

1684
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:24,580
This should have been like...

1685
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:28,860
This should have been like 20, like at least 30 people.

1686
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:29,280
Yeah.

1687
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:31,540
Oh god.

1688
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:32,480
I thought that was a ghost.

1689
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:33,540
That's just Tubbo.

1690
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:34,040
Hi, Sam.

1691
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:39,560
That's just Tubbo.

1692
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:40,280
Cuidado, Tubbo.

1693
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,280
Cuidado, Tubbo.

1694
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:43,280
Okay.

1695
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:44,220
Oh my god.

1696
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:45,040
Here we go.

1697
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:45,600
Come on.

1698
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:46,000
Come on.

1699
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:46,240
Please.

1700
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:46,600
Hello?

1701
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:47,640
Hi, DC.

1702
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:48,640
Hello?

1703
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:49,680
No, that's not Tubbo.

1704
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:51,840
Are we done yet?

1705
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:53,180
This is the first mile run in.

1706
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:55,440
We're just journalists.

1707
01:05:57,460 --> 01:05:59,360
We're not supposed to be running.

1708
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:01,400
What the fuck?

1709
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:04,480
How much more of this do we have to do?

1710
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:08,060
Well, there's a box that's not for me, I guess.

1711
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,920
Don't get near the person with the box.

1712
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:12,800
Don't freeze me.

1713
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:13,300
Don't freeze me.

1714
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:13,860
I'm just a girl.

1715
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:14,320
All right.

1716
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:16,240
There's no way.

1717
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,020
We must be top 15.

1718
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:18,960
There's no way.

1719
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:20,420
I didn't get stopped once.

1720
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:21,280
Come on, bro.

1721
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:22,840
We can do this.

1722
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:23,260
We can do this.

1723
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:23,700
We can do this.

1724
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:24,080
We can do this.

1725
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:24,220
We can do this.

1726
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:25,880
I'm dead.

1727
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:26,440
I'm dying.

1728
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:28,700
Get away.

1729
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:29,160
It's mine.

1730
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:38,220
You feel like I've seen this place like 20 times today.

1731
01:06:39,140 --> 01:06:39,540
Shut up.

1732
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:41,500
I slowed myself down.

1733
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:44,040
I'm actually going to poop my pants.

1734
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,220
I don't feel like I looked at the same hall like this.

1735
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:47,340
Holy shit!

1736
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:48,420
Bye, Tubbo!

1737
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:49,960
Bye, Tubbo!

1738
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:50,460
Wait for me!

1739
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:52,280
Don't leave me!

1740
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:54,780
What's going on?

1741
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:59,960
Someone please chop this mansion in half, please.

1742
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:00,500
Someone please chop this mansion in half, please.

1743
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:01,240
All the way in the front?

1744
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:02,700
Yeah, that's crazy.

1745
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:07,980
Chop this mansion in half for the love of God.

1746
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:08,160
Chop this mansion in half for the love of God.

1747
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:08,360
Flex!

1748
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:09,080
Flex!

1749
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:11,140
There's still no one safe.

1750
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,160
There's still no one safe.

1751
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:18,320
No one fucking safe?

1752
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:19,060
What the heck?

1753
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:24,920
If nobody in the front is safe, that means there's so much...

1754
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:27,360
There's so much more.

1755
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:32,380
There's so much more.

1756
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:41,080
We got this!

1757
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:43,940
Everything's fine.

1758
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:45,500
Everything's fine.

1759
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:46,920
This is...

1760
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:49,220
Oh, God.

1761
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:54,420
This is it.

1762
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:55,500
Please.

1763
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:56,760
Please.

1764
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:58,400
Somebody.

1765
01:08:00,540 --> 01:08:02,480
Hey, Jack!

1766
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:05,300
You're gonna go crazy.

1767
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:10,420
How are we not done yet?

1768
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:13,260
How are we not done?

1769
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:16,880
That's all I want.

1770
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:18,860
Bye-bye.

1771
01:08:20,220 --> 01:08:21,020
Be sure.

1772
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:26,480
Thank you for the false hope.

1773
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:27,320
I appreciate it regardless.

1774
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:29,560
Let me finish this race.

1775
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,400
Wait, did I get haunted?

1776
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:35,480
Was that hot?

1777
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:37,820
Who's that?

1778
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:39,440
No, that wasn't... Oh, my God.

1779
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:41,640
Someone just fucking showed up in front of me.

1780
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:42,860
I was like, who the fuck is that?

1781
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:43,620
I'm just a girl.

1782
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:44,780
I'm just a beautiful...

1783
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:48,460
Oh, nice.

1784
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:49,020
We're okay.

1785
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:50,380
We're still okay.

1786
01:08:50,820 --> 01:08:51,780
I'm so far behind!

1787
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:53,480
You're not far behind!

1788
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:55,240
We haven't been stopped once!

1789
01:08:56,780 --> 01:08:58,420
There's no way we're behind.

1790
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:01,840
There's no way we're one of the two that gets eliminated.

1791
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:03,560
There's no way we're one of the two that gets eliminated.

1792
01:09:05,860 --> 01:09:09,480
Guys, I didn't realize how big this mansion really is, guys.

1793
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:09,780
Guys, I didn't realize how big this mansion really is, guys.

1794
01:09:09,780 --> 01:09:11,200
Like, I'm already...

1795
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:13,720
My energy's gone already.

1796
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:14,100
My energy's gone already.

1797
01:09:17,940 --> 01:09:26,700
As an introvert, I'm putting in a room filled with 150 people and having to run and hear so many voices.

1798
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:27,860
I mean, you're the person in front of me.

1799
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:28,740
Like, you've been thrown down.

1800
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:35,400
You guys, hearing all these voices for, like, 10, 15 minutes straight is really...

1801
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:37,620
I am already fucked up.

1802
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:39,500
I'm done.

1803
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:41,880
I'm scared.

1804
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:44,820
Or we could go for, like, a Hail Mary.

1805
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:45,340
Huh!

1806
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:49,220
OH MY GOD THERE'S A CHECKPOINT!!

1807
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:51,500
WHAT THE FUCK DOES A CHECKPOINT MEAN?!

1808
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:52,000
OH MY GOD!

1809
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:54,880
Like,

1810
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:01,140
what do you mean checkpoints?

1811
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:06,380
There's no fucking way!

1812
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:08,620
He's doing more!

1813
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:13,120
OH SHIT!

1814
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:13,540
NICE!

1815
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,980
I can't believe it.

1816
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:20,860
I can't believe it.

1817
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:23,400
Why would you fall off?

1818
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:25,180
It's a bridge!

1819
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:28,720
How can you fall off from this?

1820
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:31,460
Oh god, okay, now I'm scared.

1821
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:36,880
Okay, now I'm scared a little bit.

1822
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:38,480
Because I said that.

1823
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:45,000
The moment I see 1 out of 140, I know it's fucking over.

1824
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:46,380
I'll be free.

1825
01:10:46,780 --> 01:10:56,300
The moment I see 1 out of 140, I know freedom is so close.

1826
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:00,060
Freedom will be there.

1827
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,480
Oh my god, vida, thank you for the raid!

1828
01:11:03,740 --> 01:11:03,960
Thank you!

1829
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:08,460
We're doing a Minecraft Witch Rivals, but I'm already dead.

1830
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:09,000
I'm already so...

1831
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,640
My mental is already so...

1832
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:21,180
I've been running this course, I feel like, for like 15 minutes straight right now.

1833
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:26,960
We have to put out emo-only mode, because they're worried that people are gonna ghost, because there's 150 players.

1834
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:30,120
And first prize is like $70,000.

1835
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:33,340
We have to have emo-only mode.

1836
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:34,720
But right now...

1837
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:36,400
Oh shit, nice.

1838
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,720
Oh my god, fuck you.

1839
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:41,240
You missed your shot?

1840
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:43,180
He's in front of me!

1841
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:44,720
How do you...

1842
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:46,940
How do I miss something point blank...

1843
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:47,680
twice?

1844
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:52,820
It landed!

1845
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:54,380
There's no fucking way.

1846
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:58,860
There's no fucking way I missed twice.

1847
01:11:59,560 --> 01:11:59,640
Okay.

1848
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:01,620
Oh my god, nice.

1849
01:12:01,940 --> 01:12:04,000
2 out of 100 checkpoints.

1850
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:05,140
Nice.

1851
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:06,700
2 out of 100.

1852
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:07,820
We're doing it, guys.

1853
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:09,600
Alright.

1854
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:10,160
Alright.

1855
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:12,380
Here we go.

1856
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:15,140
Please.

1857
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,160
Someone, please.

1858
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,520
Take me out of this misery.

1859
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:25,340
Alright.

1860
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:27,160
Here we go.

1861
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:29,900
Where are we?

1862
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:31,620
I wish there was a map.

1863
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:34,640
Like, there's so many things in this...

1864
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:37,780
like, in this Minecraft thing, but we don't have a map.

1865
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:39,640
That's the only...

1866
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:40,100
You're sitting there.

1867
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:44,180
The only thing we're missing is a goddamn map.

1868
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:46,560
So I know how far we have left.

1869
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:48,780
That's all I want.

1870
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:51,300
There should be players.

1871
01:12:51,740 --> 01:12:52,660
Wouldn't it be funny?

1872
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:54,280
I've been, like, open mic this entire time.

1873
01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:54,760
There's no way.

1874
01:12:54,980 --> 01:12:56,780
I purposely made sure I was pushed to talk.

1875
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:58,160
It would be so funny.

1876
01:12:58,220 --> 01:13:03,200
I've been, like, annoying, like, 140 people with me ranting about this game.

1877
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:08,780
I thought I was about to.

1878
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:09,260
There's no way.

1879
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:11,040
There's no way.

1880
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:14,400
Nobody could hear my cries of pain except for you guys.

1881
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:16,160
Oh, God.

1882
01:13:18,860 --> 01:13:19,860
We're so close.

1883
01:13:21,140 --> 01:13:22,700
I said that 10 minutes ago.

1884
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,580
But we're so close, guys.

1885
01:13:30,020 --> 01:13:31,320
We're so close, guys.

1886
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:32,060
I swear.

1887
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:35,940
We're so close.

1888
01:13:37,930 --> 01:13:38,980
I got the speed.

1889
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,800
I got the speed.

1890
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:44,220
But yet, for some reason, she's still faster than me.

1891
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:46,460
Oh.

1892
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:48,260
Oh, my God.

1893
01:13:48,740 --> 01:13:49,680
There's hope.

1894
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:50,720
Guys.

1895
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:53,180
Oh, my God.

1896
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:55,860
How far ahead is this man?

1897
01:13:56,420 --> 01:14:00,400
Bro, this guy is first place and nobody else has made it yet.

1898
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:01,340
Bro, this guy is first place It is.

1899
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:10,680

1900
01:14:14,930 --> 01:14:27,090

1901
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:44,430
Guys, I'm scared now!

1902
01:14:45,710 --> 01:14:47,570
It's going so fast!

1903
01:14:47,970 --> 01:14:51,870
Guys, it's going so fast, guys!

1904
01:14:51,870 --> 01:14:58,590
Guys, there's no way!

1905
01:14:59,510 --> 01:15:02,490
Guys, I'm scared!

1906
01:15:02,730 --> 01:15:04,790
I'm actually scared now!

1907
01:15:05,950 --> 01:15:07,130
Oh, wait!

1908
01:15:08,790 --> 01:15:12,650
Oh my God, is that it?

1909
01:15:12,910 --> 01:15:14,090
Oh my God!

1910
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:17,250
I didn't realize how far back I was!

1911
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:21,130
Please, we're so close!

1912
01:15:22,710 --> 01:15:25,090
Oh my god, this is amazing!

1913
01:15:26,490 --> 01:15:28,870
I didn't get 97!

1914
01:15:30,250 --> 01:15:32,090
Oh, thank god!

1915
01:15:32,990 --> 01:15:35,430
I thought I found a star!

1916
01:15:36,290 --> 01:15:38,130
Oh, thank fucking god.

1917
01:15:41,690 --> 01:15:42,570
How?

1918
01:15:45,670 --> 01:15:46,150
How?

1919
01:15:46,350 --> 01:15:47,170
I muted everybody!

1920
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:51,430
Please.

1921
01:15:53,790 --> 01:15:55,490
Oh god, thank god.

1922
01:15:58,860 --> 01:16:00,750
Alright, un-emote mode, guys.

1923
01:16:00,810 --> 01:16:01,410
We did it.

1924
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:04,610
Is my mod still around?

1925
01:16:04,870 --> 01:16:05,870
Un-emote mode.

1926
01:16:06,290 --> 01:16:08,310
How do I un-emote mode?

1927
01:16:09,650 --> 01:16:11,790
You can remove emote mode now.

1928
01:16:12,090 --> 01:16:13,810
How was I 97?

1929
01:16:14,910 --> 01:16:18,510
I thought I was doing pretty well.

1930
01:16:18,630 --> 01:16:20,270
I didn't get stopped at all.

1931
01:16:23,130 --> 01:16:25,550
How the fuck was I 97?

1932
01:16:26,370 --> 01:16:27,650
I swear to...

1933
01:16:27,650 --> 01:16:30,150
Okay, at least, guys, I don't have to uninstall this game.

1934
01:16:30,290 --> 01:16:31,930
I'm not one of the two people.

1935
01:16:33,710 --> 01:16:38,350
I'm not one of the two people that got eliminated.

1936
01:16:38,770 --> 01:16:42,650
Just so you guys know, two people will be eliminated in this game.

1937
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:48,710
And I said I would never play Minecraft again if I was that unfortunate.

1938
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:51,110
I said I would never play Minecraft again if I was that unfortunate.

1939
01:16:53,410 --> 01:16:54,290
I said I would never play Minecraft again if I was that unfortunate.

1940
01:16:54,290 --> 01:16:54,810
Oh my god.

1941
01:16:55,910 --> 01:16:56,710
I'm happy.

1942
01:16:56,870 --> 01:16:57,630
I'm so happy.

1943
01:16:58,870 --> 01:16:59,750
Jesus Christ.

1944
01:16:59,850 --> 01:17:02,430
I hope you guys could hear me with all the people talking.

1945
01:17:03,010 --> 01:17:05,090
I couldn't even tell you guys could hear me.

1946
01:17:05,130 --> 01:17:07,970
There was just too much dialogue.

1947
01:17:09,690 --> 01:17:11,810
Too many people were talking.

1948
01:17:13,130 --> 01:17:14,390
Oh my god.

1949
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:16,210
Like, oh no, I'm stuck.

1950
01:17:16,350 --> 01:17:17,650
I was, like, so overwhelmed.

1951
01:17:17,870 --> 01:17:20,010
I came in here, lots of energy.

1952
01:17:21,130 --> 01:17:23,670
Lots of energy prepared for this event.

1953
01:17:24,150 --> 01:17:26,030
150 people started talking.

1954
01:17:26,270 --> 01:17:27,630
And now I'm out.

1955
01:17:31,890 --> 01:17:33,930
All that energy gone.

1956
01:17:36,330 --> 01:17:37,510
Oh my god.

1957
01:17:38,330 --> 01:17:40,050
Alright, who's gonna be eliminated anyway?

1958
01:17:42,310 --> 01:17:43,530
Who's gonna make it?

1959
01:17:43,670 --> 01:17:44,850
The batter...

1960
01:17:44,850 --> 01:17:46,050
Yeah, Gumi apparently made it.

1961
01:17:46,130 --> 01:17:47,150
I saw someone said it in chat.

1962
01:17:47,430 --> 01:17:48,310
She made it.

1963
01:17:48,410 --> 01:17:49,350
I don't see her though.

1964
01:17:49,890 --> 01:17:51,110
I turned off the...

1965
01:17:51,110 --> 01:17:53,070
voice chat because it was just too much.

1966
01:17:53,250 --> 01:17:55,550
Like, 150 people in this room.

1967
01:17:56,490 --> 01:17:57,930
Gumi was top 20.

1968
01:17:57,950 --> 01:17:59,550
Okay, she's a Minecraft player though.

1969
01:18:00,690 --> 01:18:02,510
She actually plays Minecraft.

1970
01:18:02,690 --> 01:18:03,570
Like, I'm not surprised.

1971
01:18:03,890 --> 01:18:05,450
My best bet is I don't...

1972
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:06,510
Because the next game...

1973
01:18:07,110 --> 01:18:09,590
The next game is...

1974
01:18:09,590 --> 01:18:09,930
Um...

1975
01:18:10,730 --> 01:18:11,330
Is...

1976
01:18:11,330 --> 01:18:12,050
Uh...

1977
01:18:12,050 --> 01:18:13,150
PvP.

1978
01:18:13,210 --> 01:18:14,350
It's a 1v1.

1979
01:18:15,010 --> 01:18:15,610
Uh...

1980
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:17,790
It's a 1v1.

1981
01:18:17,890 --> 01:18:20,250
And, like, I'm so fucked if, like...

1982
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:22,330
I'm against an actual Minecraft player.

1983
01:18:25,590 --> 01:18:28,070
It's like some goddamn PvP shit.

1984
01:18:29,770 --> 01:18:30,550
Alright, guys.

1985
01:18:30,650 --> 01:18:33,470
Also, like, I stopped caring about the swear rule.

1986
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:35,950
Like, they're not gonna check this pod, right?

1987
01:18:38,030 --> 01:18:41,130
As long as I'm not swearing in other people's streams.

1988
01:18:41,610 --> 01:18:42,130
Like...

1989
01:18:42,130 --> 01:18:45,790
Guys, we all know I'm not gonna make it to fucking top 20.

1990
01:18:46,090 --> 01:18:48,190
Guys, I'm here for the content.

1991
01:18:49,030 --> 01:18:49,570
Yeah.

1992
01:18:50,010 --> 01:18:52,750
150 people and I'm the only one swearing.

1993
01:18:52,870 --> 01:18:53,970
Like, I call that bullshit.

1994
01:18:56,170 --> 01:18:58,970
Like, I believe the Minecraft players wouldn't...

1995
01:18:58,970 --> 01:19:00,810
The Minecraft players would follow the rules.

1996
01:19:01,110 --> 01:19:02,490
Like, will follow the rules.

1997
01:19:02,610 --> 01:19:07,010
But the non-Minecraft players like me would definitely not be following.

1998
01:19:10,070 --> 01:19:10,790
Oh, wait.

1999
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:11,470
One more person.

2000
01:19:11,950 --> 01:19:12,810
Oh, okay.

2001
01:19:13,010 --> 01:19:13,310
Yeah!

2002
01:19:13,410 --> 01:19:14,030
We did it!

2003
01:19:15,410 --> 01:19:16,490
140 players!

2004
01:19:18,230 --> 01:19:18,810
Oh.

2005
01:19:21,010 --> 01:19:22,070
No, Tiffany.

2006
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:23,830
Whoever you are.

2007
01:19:24,390 --> 01:19:25,550
No, Leefison.

2008
01:19:25,830 --> 01:19:27,130
Whoever you are.

2009
01:19:28,530 --> 01:19:30,210
I don't know who you are.

2010
01:19:30,510 --> 01:19:32,090
No, Sophity.

2011
01:19:32,470 --> 01:19:33,610
Rest in peace.

2012
01:19:33,990 --> 01:19:35,770
I don't know who you are.

2013
01:19:36,270 --> 01:19:36,850
But...

2014
01:19:36,850 --> 01:19:37,650
Oh, no!

2015
01:19:37,750 --> 01:19:39,090
Wait, that's a VTuber!

2016
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:40,510
Oh, no!

2017
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:42,990
Project...

2018
01:19:42,990 --> 01:19:44,190
Oh, is that Project Melody?

2019
01:19:44,770 --> 01:19:45,350
No!

2020
01:19:46,710 --> 01:19:47,290
Melody!

2021
01:19:50,410 --> 01:19:51,390
Oh, no!

2022
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:52,570
Don't worry.

2023
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:54,950
I'll carry on the banner.

2024
01:19:55,130 --> 01:19:57,610
The VTuber banner with Rosadoodle.

2025
01:19:57,750 --> 01:19:59,190
I think Rosadoodle is still in, too.

2026
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:01,050
Don't worry.

2027
01:20:01,450 --> 01:20:04,310
We'll get eliminated the next game instead.

2028
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:13,120
Oh.

2029
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:16,880
Oh, okay.

2030
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:17,820
Now I can...

2031
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:18,780
I should be able to...

2032
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:20,820
Blinking?

2033
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:21,920
Hello!

2034
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:23,280
You survived!

2035
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:23,580
Oh, my God.

2036
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:23,620
We're back!

2037
01:20:24,620 --> 01:20:27,080
Oh, my God.

2038
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:27,980
We woke up.

2039
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:30,220
I just woke up from my nightmare.

2040
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:32,720
Gotta find people I know.

2041
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:36,340
Your top five on the Minecraft category?

2042
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:37,600
Oh, God.

2043
01:20:38,860 --> 01:20:39,680
Oh, God.

2044
01:20:39,820 --> 01:20:40,280
Please.

2045
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:42,740
Don't have zero expectations.

2046
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:46,280
Please.

2047
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:49,140
Please have zero expectations on me.

2048
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:49,540
I'm not...

2049
01:20:49,540 --> 01:20:51,620
I'm not like your other Minecraft players.

2050
01:20:51,660 --> 01:20:53,020
I don't know what I'm doing.

2051
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:54,200
I found this guy, like...

2052
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:56,900
I was 97th in the race, guys.

2053
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:00,740
Oh, no.

2054
01:21:00,980 --> 01:21:01,460
No!

2055
01:21:01,580 --> 01:21:03,140
Then these children are watching!

2056
01:21:03,620 --> 01:21:03,920
No!

2057
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:05,680
All right, kids.

2058
01:21:05,740 --> 01:21:10,680
If you're watching me and you have Twitch Prime, don't worry.

2059
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:11,760
Your mom will have Twitch Prime.

2060
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:14,520
How did y'all go so fast?

2061
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:16,940
Oh, no.

2062
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:18,200
I can't believe it.

2063
01:21:18,220 --> 01:21:20,360
The Minecraft kids are watching me now.

2064
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:22,280
Minecraft children.

2065
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:24,400
Let me introduce you to better games.

2066
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:28,260
All right.

2067
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:31,360
For all those who are new here, I actually usually stream on YouTube.

2068
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:39,620
But because this is a Twitch Rivals tournament, that's why I'm the Twitch.

2069
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:43,720
But yeah, please check me out on YouTube if you enjoy this content.

2070
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:49,780
I barely could take in this entire mansion because all I did was just run.

2071
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:52,980
Oh, sorry.

2072
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:54,780
What the fuck?

2073
01:21:58,940 --> 01:22:00,460
Where did I...

2074
01:22:00,460 --> 01:22:01,120
Okay.

2075
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:05,980
Okay.

2076
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:07,920
I don't know what's going on with that girl.

2077
01:22:09,860 --> 01:22:10,940
My goodness.

2078
01:22:15,010 --> 01:22:19,740
Are you going to get a chance to like actually take in the mansion builds?

2079
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:20,400
Because...

2080
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,400
I swear I was just like...

2081
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:24,500
I swear I was just like...

2082
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:27,560
People were just like...

2083
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:28,860
People were just like...

2084
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:30,080
in my space.

2085
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:32,220
I couldn't even see what was going on.

2086
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:35,500
Spaniel?

2087
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:40,220
Yeah, there's like a lot of Spanish speaking streamers in this tournament too.

2088
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:42,340
Because Minecraft is really popular.

2089
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:43,820
Oh wait, that's her again.

2090
01:22:47,820 --> 01:22:49,960
Every time I bump into her, she's eating.

2091
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:58,200
I never got a chance to get haunted by the ghost.

2092
01:22:58,440 --> 01:22:59,800
I still can't believe it.

2093
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:02,740
I never got haunted by a ghost.

2094
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:07,320
I never got haunted by the ghost.

2095
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:08,900
But I'm still 97.

2096
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:10,640
What is the tech?

2097
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:13,800
What the heck?

2098
01:23:13,820 --> 01:23:14,640
What the heck is the tech?

2099
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:18,940
How do you go so fast?

2100
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:22,360
I just...

2101
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:23,620
You run?

2102
01:23:24,180 --> 01:23:25,900
You run and hold space?

2103
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:28,400
You don't manually jump?

2104
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:30,020
You just let the jumping...

2105
01:23:30,020 --> 01:23:31,680
Wait, is that it?

2106
01:23:33,580 --> 01:23:35,680
You hold space?

2107
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:38,720
I've been manually jumping by the way.

2108
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:42,960
I've been manually pressing the jump.

2109
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:47,680
That's how you do the bunny hop.

2110
01:23:49,460 --> 01:23:49,980
That's how you do the bunny hop.

2111
01:23:50,620 --> 01:23:52,880
I've been doing this.

2112
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:56,920
Yeah,

2113
01:24:00,180 --> 01:24:00,700
I didn't.

2114
01:24:00,780 --> 01:24:01,520
Well, now I know.

2115
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:03,600
Now that I know, it's over.

2116
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:04,700
It's over.

2117
01:24:04,820 --> 01:24:05,980
We're going to be doing so well.

2118
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:07,340
Okay, look.

2119
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:10,540
People don't hold buttons in FPS.

2120
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:13,800
People don't hold buttons in FPS.

2121
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:14,900
We hold right click.

2122
01:24:15,580 --> 01:24:17,660
But not for jumping, okay?

2123
01:24:17,980 --> 01:24:19,420
Guys, I don't know if you guys know this.

2124
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:22,880
But in shooter games, we don't jump a lot.

2125
01:24:23,020 --> 01:24:25,000
Because when you jump, you're more predictable.

2126
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:27,900
So I didn't know the tech.

2127
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:28,640
Come on, come on.

2128
01:24:28,860 --> 01:24:32,060
Keep acting as if we've never been here.

2129
01:24:32,060 --> 01:24:32,460
Oh my god.

2130
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:37,000
At least not a lot of people got eliminated though.

2131
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:37,420
Oh my gosh.

2132
01:24:37,420 --> 01:24:38,160
There's a little girl.

2133
01:24:38,260 --> 01:24:42,200
I just followed the mob of people and I saw the mob of people go right.

2134
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:42,800
And I was like, okay.

2135
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:48,760
I wonder if right was faster than left though.

2136
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:51,220
I wonder.

2137
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:55,080
This is a long intermission.

2138
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:58,360
I sit with the little girl.

2139
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:00,540
This is a very long intermission.

2140
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:01,920
Take us to the second game.

2141
01:25:02,060 --> 01:25:02,840
Wait, I have an egg.

2142
01:25:04,220 --> 01:25:06,160
I have an egg.

2143
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:07,960
On my bottom right.

2144
01:25:08,260 --> 01:25:09,120
What is that?

2145
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:13,680
Oh my god.

2146
01:25:14,140 --> 01:25:14,280
Where's Gumi?

2147
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:16,840
Where's Gumi?

2148
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:21,740
Playing Apex Minecraft now.

2149
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:24,780
I mean there's Roblox Apex.

2150
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:26,080
I don't know if you guys have ever seen it.

2151
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:29,600
I played Overwatch Roblox.

2152
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:31,420
Just because I was curious.

2153
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:33,940
Guys.

2154
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:35,140
Stream snipe for me.

2155
01:25:35,220 --> 01:25:35,660
Where's Gumi?

2156
01:25:38,140 --> 01:25:38,620
Hello!

2157
01:25:39,740 --> 01:25:42,860
Would you want an alliance with me, Guapo, and E-Rob?

2158
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:44,060
It's a winning team.

2159
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:44,640
I swear.

2160
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:45,180
Are you sure?

2161
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:46,440
What if we get eliminated?

2162
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:49,420
How can we get eliminated?

2163
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:50,000
We have E-Rob.

2164
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:51,480
Oh, wait, but...

2165
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:53,240
No, that's why we're going to get eliminated.

2166
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:57,440
Don't listen to her, E-Rob.

2167
01:25:57,540 --> 01:25:59,580
What do you mean by that?

2168
01:26:02,780 --> 01:26:03,900
Don't listen to her, E-Rob.

2169
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:04,280
It's okay.

2170
01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:06,800
He didn't lose the last run.

2171
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:09,660
He made it before the seven people that got eliminated.

2172
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:11,000
Okay, what's the placement?

2173
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:11,960
What did E-Rob place?

2174
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:13,900
We don't have to talk about that.

2175
01:26:14,140 --> 01:26:15,340
What did E-Rob place?

2176
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:17,840
You know, what did you place E-Rob!

2177
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:19,560
As long as you qualify.

2178
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:20,520
1-0-2.

2179
01:26:20,620 --> 01:26:21,240
1-0-2.

2180
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:22,000
Remember what did you place?

2181
01:26:22,820 --> 01:26:26,140
I was, like, 10 behind you, or 8 behind you or something, because I...

2182
01:26:26,860 --> 01:26:27,760
Yeah, I had a wooden mouse.

2183
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:28,680
1-0-2 is nice.

2184
01:26:29,900 --> 01:26:31,080
Don't be nice.

2185
01:26:31,740 --> 01:26:32,140
Hey.

2186
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:35,340
So are you joining us, or not?

2187
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:37,600
okay, alright.

2188
01:26:37,740 --> 01:26:39,760
Sure, I'll join your alliance.

2189
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:43,860
Okay, so... You know the next game?

2190
01:26:44,140 --> 01:26:46,080
It's like some 1v1 shit, right?

2191
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:47,740
Wait, Doki, what did you get?

2192
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:50,220
Definitely not 1v2.

2193
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:52,700
Okay, what did you get, though?

2194
01:26:52,940 --> 01:26:55,020
Because I didn't see you up front, so...

2195
01:26:55,020 --> 01:26:57,660
I was top 100, just so you know.

2196
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:00,800
Oh, but like, how top 100 were you?

2197
01:27:00,900 --> 01:27:02,220
Look, top 100 counts.

2198
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:05,020
It's below EROP.

2199
01:27:06,220 --> 01:27:08,720
Okay, so double digits, but like, which digits?

2200
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:09,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2201
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:09,580
Double digits.

2202
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:10,740
That's all you need.

2203
01:27:10,820 --> 01:27:12,320
It's a 2-view, not 3-view.

2204
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:14,360
Okay.

2205
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,580
So in a 1v1, do you beat EROP?

2206
01:27:16,660 --> 01:27:16,980
Be honest.

2207
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:18,840
Yeah, I think so.

2208
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:20,260
I think so, too.

2209
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:20,640
Yeah.

2210
01:27:20,820 --> 01:27:22,080
EROP, do you even play Minecraft?

2211
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:23,040
No, no, no, no.

2212
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:24,160
Doki doesn't play Overwatch.

2213
01:27:24,580 --> 01:27:25,380
Doki is cracked.

2214
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:29,160
Okay, Overwatch isn't Minecraft.

2215
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:32,320
Yeah, but you don't even play Minecraft!

2216
01:27:33,260 --> 01:27:34,620
I've beaten the game on hardcore.

2217
01:27:36,820 --> 01:27:38,160
That's great, EROP.

2218
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:38,760
That's it.

2219
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:40,460
Good for you.

2220
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:41,380
I'm proud of you, man.

2221
01:27:41,780 --> 01:27:42,600
That's so good.

2222
01:27:44,140 --> 01:27:44,540
Have you?

2223
01:27:46,220 --> 01:27:46,660
No, no.

2224
01:27:46,660 --> 01:27:49,220
Bro, Minecraft's been out for like 20 plus years.

2225
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:50,980
You beat hardcore Minecraft.

2226
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:53,780
Yeah, I beat Minecraft hardcore.

2227
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:56,540
Like, when I was like 13.

2228
01:27:57,800 --> 01:27:58,380
Oh, man.

2229
01:27:58,480 --> 01:27:59,160
Come on.

2230
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:00,460
Like, you ain't got nothing to do with it.

2231
01:28:00,700 --> 01:28:01,900
We're a team, guys.

2232
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:02,520
We're a team.

2233
01:28:03,060 --> 01:28:04,440
That laugh is so toxic.

2234
01:28:05,180 --> 01:28:09,080
Hey, Steve with 8 out of 10 eggs coming through.

2235
01:28:09,140 --> 01:28:09,640
Watch out.

2236
01:28:09,860 --> 01:28:10,260
What?

2237
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:10,900
8 out of 10?

2238
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:16,020
Wait, it took you three years on stream to beat Minecraft hardcore?

2239
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:19,160
No, it took me like two months.

2240
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:23,400
You could not force that out of me.

2241
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:31,400
I believe in this team.

2242
01:28:31,460 --> 01:28:33,120
This next game is about lying.

2243
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:34,160
So, like...

2244
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:35,620
Oh.

2245
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:38,920
Everyone's muted.

2246
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:41,200
Maybe there's like eggs up here.

2247
01:28:42,940 --> 01:28:43,420
Alright.

2248
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:44,960
Yeah.

2249
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:46,020
We'll win, right, guys?

2250
01:28:46,340 --> 01:28:46,820
Yeah.

2251
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:47,560
Yeah.

2252
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:48,700
We'll totally win.

2253
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:49,320
I haven't seen any.

2254
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:53,260
What's the 15 incident?

2255
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:54,880
Who in my chat are asking?

2256
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:55,760
Oh, okay.

2257
01:28:55,900 --> 01:28:56,380
Okay.

2258
01:28:56,580 --> 01:28:57,140
Doki, no.

2259
01:28:57,880 --> 01:28:59,540
After Rivals, you can ask that.

2260
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:00,140
Oh, okay.

2261
01:29:00,980 --> 01:29:01,460
Okay.

2262
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:02,580
Okay.

2263
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:03,180
Same here.

2264
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:06,800
Yeah, I believe.

2265
01:29:07,220 --> 01:29:08,520
I believe in this team.

2266
01:29:10,460 --> 01:29:10,780
Wait.

2267
01:29:10,860 --> 01:29:12,640
So, what is the second game?

2268
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:13,800
I didn't really understand it.

2269
01:29:13,940 --> 01:29:14,760
I think he'll tell us.

2270
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:15,800
Yeah.

2271
01:29:15,820 --> 01:29:17,560
We'll get a video that even E-Rob can understand.

2272
01:29:17,820 --> 01:29:18,300
Oh, okay.

2273
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:18,720
Sweet.

2274
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:19,140
Nice.

2275
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:21,760
As long as he understands, our team will be solid.

2276
01:29:22,540 --> 01:29:22,860
Yes.

2277
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:24,460
Did you read the rules, though?

2278
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:25,860
It's in the daily itinerary.

2279
01:29:26,620 --> 01:29:26,940
Yeah.

2280
01:29:26,980 --> 01:29:27,500
I read the rules.

2281
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:28,920
I just didn't really understand the game.

2282
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:29,200
Yeah.

2283
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:29,560
I don't really understand.

2284
01:29:29,620 --> 01:29:29,940
Yeah.

2285
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:30,940
I was just like, what?

2286
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:31,980
The lying thing?

2287
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:33,420
I think you get one of the three.

2288
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:34,260
So, it's like rock, paper, scissors.

2289
01:29:34,380 --> 01:29:35,480
But like, oh, I have rock.

2290
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:37,060
And I have to like lie or betray.

2291
01:29:37,060 --> 01:29:37,340
Yeah.

2292
01:29:37,340 --> 01:29:38,500
So, it's just like among us.

2293
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:39,020
Among us or something.

2294
01:29:39,220 --> 01:29:39,960
So, it'd be like I...

2295
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:40,280
Yeah.

2296
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:42,340
It's kind of like playing Overwatch and only playing ball.

2297
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:43,720
And then if you get counterfeit, you complain.

2298
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:44,480
Yeah.

2299
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:44,800
Yeah.

2300
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:45,000
Yeah.

2301
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:45,540
It says your fault.

2302
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:48,740
I paid $40 to only know it's free to play now.

2303
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:51,020
I paid $40 for this Hammond skin.

2304
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:52,380
I should be allowed to play Hammond.

2305
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:53,480
Yeah.

2306
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:56,160
All right, guys.

2307
01:29:56,240 --> 01:29:57,920
I believe in this team, guys.

2308
01:29:58,220 --> 01:29:59,400
Guapo already picked his, though.

2309
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:01,540
Guapo said he's Blade and he's refusing to swap.

2310
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:02,240
So, like I don't know.

2311
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:02,420
Yeah.

2312
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:02,760
I'm Blade.

2313
01:30:03,060 --> 01:30:04,220
But there's only three.

2314
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:05,300
So, we only have three.

2315
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:05,940
Yeah.

2316
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:06,580
I checked these two rooms.

2317
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:07,140
I didn't see any.

2318
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:08,140
One, two, three.

2319
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:08,760
Yeah.

2320
01:30:09,340 --> 01:30:10,220
I mean, like...

2321
01:30:10,220 --> 01:30:10,640
Oh, okay.

2322
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:11,500
Hi, Mendo.

2323
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:12,520
I don't know where they are.

2324
01:30:12,620 --> 01:30:13,160
I know there's one more.

2325
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:13,820
You made it two.

2326
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:15,060
What place did you get?

2327
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:15,200
I didn't.

2328
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:16,520
Oh, I got 80 first.

2329
01:30:18,100 --> 01:30:18,460
Okay.

2330
01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:18,820
Okay.

2331
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:20,300
Do you want to guess what this game is?

2332
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:22,940
What was it?

2333
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:24,120
Hey, it's not that...

2334
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:25,980
Don't you... What number did you get?

2335
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:26,480
Because I know.

2336
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:28,980
Like your chat is snitching on you.

2337
01:30:29,060 --> 01:30:30,180
I'm just not going to say it.

2338
01:30:30,420 --> 01:30:31,720
I said top 100.

2339
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,000
That's all that matters.

2340
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,180
You weren't lying, I guess.

2341
01:30:34,780 --> 01:30:35,940
It is top 100.

2342
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,100
I think it was pretty close.

2343
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:38,560
Yeah.

2344
01:30:38,940 --> 01:30:39,660
What were you?

2345
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:40,480
You got 97.

2346
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:42,280
I got like 20 or 30 or something.

2347
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:43,180
You can't say that.

2348
01:30:43,180 --> 01:30:44,160
You got 102.

2349
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:46,220
You made it.

2350
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:47,980
Was that you at the finish line?

2351
01:30:48,820 --> 01:30:49,820
I was sitting there.

2352
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:50,160
Yeah.

2353
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:50,800
Okay.

2354
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:52,840
Somebody was like, Sasha, you're going to make it.

2355
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:54,200
All right.

2356
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:55,000
That was me.

2357
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:55,800
Okay.

2358
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:56,980
I thought so.

2359
01:30:57,240 --> 01:30:59,400
I was yelling for E-Rob, but he actually...

2360
01:30:59,400 --> 01:30:59,620
Yeah.

2361
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:00,960
It's okay.

2362
01:31:01,340 --> 01:31:02,180
We made it.

2363
01:31:02,180 --> 01:31:02,860
It was so nice to have a man on the inside of the finish line.

2364
01:31:02,860 --> 01:31:05,900
As long as we're below E-Rob, that's all that matters.

2365
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:07,900
See, I was trying to grease people up front, so I would have gotten...

2366
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:10,140
I was getting all the snowballs and stuff.

2367
01:31:11,420 --> 01:31:11,820
It's top 100.

2368
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:17,140
I didn't get caught by the girls at any point except for right in front of the finish line because I tried to get greedy.

2369
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:19,960
Top 100 is top 100.

2370
01:31:20,420 --> 01:31:21,200
I got caught once.

2371
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:22,140
You can't take that from me.

2372
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:23,420
I got caught like three times.

2373
01:31:23,900 --> 01:31:24,920
Dave, you made it.

2374
01:31:26,420 --> 01:31:26,840
Let's go.

2375
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:28,440
I'm glad.

2376
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:29,500
I'm scared of the next game.

2377
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:29,960
Yeah.

2378
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:30,520
Me too.

2379
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:32,120
I'm shaking in my boots.

2380
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:34,680
I don't want to lie.

2381
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:35,600
I want to be friends.

2382
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:37,680
And I didn't know how to jump, too.

2383
01:31:37,740 --> 01:31:37,880
I didn't know how to jump.

2384
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:37,920
I mean, I'm a good player.

2385
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:39,200
I think it's rock, paper, scissors.

2386
01:31:39,380 --> 01:31:39,520
Wait.

2387
01:31:39,860 --> 01:31:40,920
Let's go look for Easter eggs here.

2388
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:41,980
It's like rock, paper, scissors.

2389
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:42,960
Where is the Easter egg?

2390
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:44,540
I think it's like rock, paper, scissors.

2391
01:31:45,180 --> 01:31:46,280
Hey, guys.

2392
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:48,800
Is Scooby playing fucking Pokemon right now?

2393
01:31:49,940 --> 01:31:52,720
It's not rock, paper, scissors.

2394
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:53,760
What do you mean?

2395
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:54,800
No.

2396
01:31:56,300 --> 01:32:00,720
That's everything I relied on the intel that's like rock, paper, scissors, guys.

2397
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:03,980
If it's not like rock, paper, scissors, then what do I do?

2398
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:05,100
There's that one over here.

2399
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:05,760
It's like we got like five people.

2400
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:08,420
What do I do if it's not like Rock, Paper, Scissors?

2401
01:32:11,620 --> 01:32:13,120
Oh, she's at the Freddy's?

2402
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:16,000
I'm heading over.

2403
01:32:17,980 --> 01:32:18,920
I'm heading over.

2404
01:32:22,020 --> 01:32:24,480
I love seeing all the different Minecraft skins.

2405
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:26,160
Wait, this is not...

2406
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:27,400
This is not it.

2407
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:34,060
I feel like I wouldn't even understand the Easter eggs because I feel like it's going to be Minecraft related.

2408
01:32:34,060 --> 01:32:36,200
And I'd be like, what the fuck is that?

2409
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:37,620
Sorry, the heck is that?

2410
01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:41,960
Where is the finale?

2411
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:42,900
Oh, it's over here.

2412
01:32:44,780 --> 01:32:46,340
I love looking at the...

2413
01:32:46,340 --> 01:32:48,500
She moved to the bedrooms?!

2414
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:49,880
Oh my god.

2415
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:52,280
I just wanted to say hi!

2416
01:32:55,660 --> 01:32:57,180
I can't believe it.

2417
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:58,740
I have to do like this merry-go-round.

2418
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:00,720
The webcam.

2419
01:33:05,300 --> 01:33:06,280
Which bedroom?

2420
01:33:06,380 --> 01:33:07,780
There's like 20 bedrooms!

2421
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:11,000
Which one's the right bedroom?

2422
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:13,820
She's running down the...

2423
01:33:13,820 --> 01:33:14,740
Oh my god.

2424
01:33:18,420 --> 01:33:19,940
Oh my god.

2425
01:33:20,180 --> 01:33:21,740
Where the heck is she?

2426
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:25,540
Where is she?

2427
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:28,520
I can't believe it.

2428
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:29,060
Guys, look at me.

2429
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:31,240
Can you tell I'm holding space jump now?

2430
01:33:31,460 --> 01:33:36,380
Look, I would have been way ahead if I knew about the space... holding space tech.

2431
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:42,360
If I knew the holding space tech, I would have been first place easy.

2432
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:46,920
I was literally nerfed and still got top 500, guys.

2433
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:52,960
I was nerfed so hard.

2434
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:54,980
Wait, Gumi!

2435
01:33:55,740 --> 01:33:56,720
There's two, there's two, there's two.

2436
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:57,040
Hello?

2437
01:33:57,240 --> 01:33:57,560
Gumi!

2438
01:33:57,800 --> 01:33:58,300
Gumi!

2439
01:33:58,420 --> 01:34:00,580
Dude, I saw you made it!

2440
01:34:00,660 --> 01:34:01,780
I made it!

2441
01:34:01,820 --> 01:34:02,740
I was so scared.

2442
01:34:02,740 --> 01:34:04,140
I was so scared.

2443
01:34:04,340 --> 01:34:07,500
I was like number 97, but I was top 100.

2444
01:34:08,620 --> 01:34:09,780
I didn't like...

2445
01:34:09,780 --> 01:34:10,860
I got 22nd.

2446
01:34:10,860 --> 01:34:11,380
I was surprised.

2447
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:14,520
I didn't realize you're supposed to hold space bar.

2448
01:34:14,740 --> 01:34:17,220
I was manually jumped.

2449
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:17,780
Do you know what?

2450
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:20,280
I thought that.

2451
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:21,120
I was like, damn.

2452
01:34:21,180 --> 01:34:24,700
She probably doesn't know how to sprint jump.

2453
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:27,600
I was just like, how are they so fast?

2454
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:29,620
I'm doing the same thing as them.

2455
01:34:30,060 --> 01:34:32,720
And then people were like, you're supposed to hold space bar.

2456
01:34:32,740 --> 01:34:34,320
When you're jumping.

2457
01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:37,000
It's great.

2458
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:38,920
Cause I didn't get hit by the ghost, too.

2459
01:34:39,700 --> 01:34:42,520
I never got hit by the ghost, but so far behind.

2460
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:43,460
I was so confused.

2461
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:45,240
I did.

2462
01:34:45,340 --> 01:34:45,880
I got hit once.

2463
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:46,460
I was right behind you.

2464
01:34:46,620 --> 01:34:48,500
Are you looking for the Easter eggs, Gumi?

2465
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:49,460
No, I'm just chilling.

2466
01:34:49,580 --> 01:34:51,880
I was talking to like Mendo and Erob earlier.

2467
01:34:52,780 --> 01:34:53,460
Oh, really?

2468
01:34:53,880 --> 01:34:54,160
Yeah.

2469
01:34:54,180 --> 01:34:56,660
Cause they wanted to do an alliance and stuff.

2470
01:34:56,840 --> 01:34:59,480
Cause like it's, they're saying like this one's like a rock, paper, scissors.

2471
01:35:00,540 --> 01:35:01,520
The next game.

2472
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:02,720
And like, I don't know.

2473
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:04,580
And like, it's all about like lying and stuff.

2474
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:06,240
Yeah.

2475
01:35:06,820 --> 01:35:09,560
But what happens if you guys go against each other then, Wendoki?

2476
01:35:10,120 --> 01:35:13,940
Then like, then I guess the alliance is over.

2477
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,560
What happens if we go against each other, Gumi?

2478
01:35:20,460 --> 01:35:21,140
60, 40.

2479
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:26,080
Like, I'll give you, I'll give you 60 if you let me.

2480
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:30,220
Yeah, you can take 40.

2481
01:35:30,680 --> 01:35:30,980
Yeah.

2482
01:35:30,980 --> 01:35:31,180
Yeah.

2483
01:35:31,180 --> 01:35:33,460
If you let me win.

2484
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:34,060
Right?

2485
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:36,340
Cause that's how much you love me.

2486
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:36,560
Right?

2487
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:37,940
Yeah.

2488
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:40,560
You wouldn't lie to me like that, right?

2489
01:35:41,540 --> 01:35:41,960
No.

2490
01:35:41,980 --> 01:35:42,480
I wouldn't.

2491
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:43,520
Do I look like a man to you?

2492
01:35:43,860 --> 01:35:44,140
Oh, that.

2493
01:35:52,820 --> 01:35:54,060
Who hurt you?

2494
01:35:55,380 --> 01:35:56,200
You know who?

2495
01:35:56,300 --> 01:35:58,120
You know every single one of my exes.

2496
01:35:58,160 --> 01:36:00,320
You literally know every one of my exes.

2497
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:07,720
What do you mean, who hurt me?

2498
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:08,040
You know!

2499
01:36:08,460 --> 01:36:10,380
1x, 2x, 3x, 4x!

2500
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:13,320
Red fish, blue fish, and purple!

2501
01:36:19,420 --> 01:36:24,640
Oh, is that what the eggs are in the bottom, right?

2502
01:36:25,540 --> 01:36:25,900
Yeah.

2503
01:36:28,300 --> 01:36:30,840
Wait, but what do we get if we get all the eggs?

2504
01:36:31,120 --> 01:36:31,480
They're the TVs.

2505
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:33,120
They're the televisions.

2506
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:34,260
Oh!

2507
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:36,400
You have to punch the televisions on the floor.

2508
01:36:36,620 --> 01:36:38,460
But what do we get if we get the Easter eggs?

2509
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:39,440
Do we get like a thousand dollars?

2510
01:36:40,860 --> 01:36:42,440
We get a thousand dollars!

2511
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:44,060
Maybe, maybe, maybe.

2512
01:36:44,660 --> 01:36:45,320
Oh, Tucky, come here!

2513
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:48,120
Here, let's do this real quick.

2514
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:51,220
I don't know, I might be able to do it as well!

2515
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:52,640
Clutchable?

2516
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:53,000
Clutchable?

2517
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:53,560
V?

2518
01:36:54,640 --> 01:36:59,220
And then settings, and then turn 3D voice to reduced.

2519
01:37:00,260 --> 01:37:01,380
Oh, 3D audio?

2520
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:03,800
Yeah, 3D audio to reduced.

2521
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:04,400
Oh!

2522
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:05,140
Oh, shit!

2523
01:37:05,420 --> 01:37:06,480
That might help a bit.

2524
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:07,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2525
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:11,160
Oh, wait!

2526
01:37:11,420 --> 01:37:12,260
Emo only chat!

2527
01:37:12,420 --> 01:37:13,060
Emo only chat!

2528
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:14,220
I got some of the Easter eggs.

2529
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:14,880
Alright.

2530
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:15,600
How many?

2531
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:16,800
Yeah, how many?

2532
01:37:17,060 --> 01:37:17,940
There's three in this corridor.

2533
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:19,280
I got seven.

2534
01:37:19,480 --> 01:37:20,460
There's one on the outside.

2535
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:20,800
I'm nine.

2536
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:21,340
Courtyard.

2537
01:37:22,780 --> 01:37:23,220
Where?

2538
01:37:23,220 --> 01:37:23,660
Where?

2539
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:24,560
Can you take me there?

2540
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:26,100
So, how is this alliance gonna work?

2541
01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:27,080
There's only seven seconds left.

2542
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:30,000
Alright, good luck everybody!

2543
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:31,680
Good luck!

2544
01:37:31,900 --> 01:37:32,280
Good luck!

2545
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:34,040
I'm blinking.

2546
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:34,800
I'm blinking.

2547
01:37:34,900 --> 01:37:35,460
I'm blinking too.

2548
01:37:35,660 --> 01:37:36,200
Hold me, Tucky!

2549
01:37:36,220 --> 01:37:37,000
Hold my hand!

2550
01:37:37,780 --> 01:37:38,280
Oh, no!

2551
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:40,120
Oh, no!

2552
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:41,500
Emo only.

2553
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:42,020
Emo only.

2554
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:42,420
Emo only.

2555
01:37:42,660 --> 01:37:43,500
Thanks, guys.

2556
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:45,580
Oh, it's like a carnival.

2557
01:37:46,900 --> 01:37:47,760
Oh, my God!

2558
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:48,860
It's Disneyland!

2559
01:37:49,580 --> 01:37:51,200
This is why Mickey's here!

2560
01:37:51,980 --> 01:37:53,140
It's a carnival?

2561
01:37:54,260 --> 01:37:56,840
This is exactly why Mickey was here.

2562
01:37:59,020 --> 01:38:00,580
It's like an amusement park.

2563
01:38:04,460 --> 01:38:08,700
I saw E-Rob.

2564
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:12,180
You got this, bro.

2565
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:13,040
Best of luck.

2566
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:13,940
I'm scared, guys.

2567
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:15,120
What?

2568
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:16,240
I'm so scared.

2569
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:17,820
I don't understand this game at all.

2570
01:38:18,580 --> 01:38:20,200
I'm so scared.

2571
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:20,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2572
01:38:23,140 --> 01:38:24,920
I don't understand this game.

2573
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:34,560
What the fuck?

2574
01:38:35,260 --> 01:38:39,380
It's not as overwhelming as the first game, that's for sure.

2575
01:38:39,460 --> 01:38:39,720
Oh, my God!

2576
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:40,560
It's Elmo in a bikini!

2577
01:38:42,980 --> 01:38:43,700
Where's Elmo?

2578
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:45,360
In a bikini!

2579
01:38:48,940 --> 01:38:50,100
Where's my squad at, bro?

2580
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:51,820
Yeah, where's my alliance?

2581
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:54,800
Where the heck is my alliance?

2582
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:58,060
I give you a high five at TwitchCon, so...

2583
01:38:58,060 --> 01:38:59,140
Oh, my God.

2584
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:03,780
How am I supposed to survive without my allies?

2585
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:09,100
How would I survive?

2586
01:39:09,540 --> 01:39:12,680
They will play five games, four rounds each.

2587
01:39:12,940 --> 01:39:14,480
One versus one, so...

2588
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:15,000
No!

2589
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:16,420
Oh, my God.

2590
01:39:16,460 --> 01:39:17,220
That's so loud.

2591
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:19,060
That's so loud.

2592
01:39:19,540 --> 01:39:23,060
I've never seen somebody so sad about rock, paper, scissors.

2593
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:26,760
Holy fuck!

2594
01:39:27,220 --> 01:39:29,660
That guy was full on despair.

2595
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:33,600
Like, what did rock, paper, scissors do to that man?

2596
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:35,700
You know how many people are getting eliminated right now?

2597
01:39:35,980 --> 01:39:36,540
30.

2598
01:39:37,140 --> 01:39:37,700
30?

2599
01:39:37,820 --> 01:39:39,420
I'm gonna be in that 30, guys.

2600
01:39:40,020 --> 01:39:41,920
There's like a 50-50...

2601
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:42,960
There's like 80...

2602
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:44,980
80, 30, a 20 chance.

2603
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:46,540
I'm in that 30.

2604
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:49,720
That's the non-Minecraft player.

2605
01:39:50,740 --> 01:39:51,820
I'm so fucked.

2606
01:39:53,060 --> 01:39:53,520
See?

2607
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:55,980
This was...

2608
01:39:55,980 --> 01:39:58,540
The non-Minecraft player here.

2609
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:00,920
I'm actually fucked, guys.

2610
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:06,360
How is the game volume loud?

2611
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:07,680
Oh, my God.

2612
01:40:07,700 --> 01:40:08,760
The ambient voice.

2613
01:40:08,860 --> 01:40:10,300
It's so loud.

2614
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:12,300
The music.

2615
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:16,460
Where's Umi?

2616
01:40:17,160 --> 01:40:19,020
Where's my ally groups?

2617
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:19,840
Let's find out.

2618
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:20,420
Let's find out.

2619
01:40:21,260 --> 01:40:22,940
Where's my ally group?

2620
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:27,420
There's so many other Minecrafters here.

2621
01:40:27,580 --> 01:40:29,740
But not the ones I want to find.

2622
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:32,420
Isn't that the fucking fighting game player?

2623
01:40:33,180 --> 01:40:33,960
Oh, my God.

2624
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,460
This is like the...

2625
01:40:36,180 --> 01:40:38,040
The crossover of the century.

2626
01:40:38,540 --> 01:40:39,500
Yeah, I think I'm gonna win.

2627
01:40:40,380 --> 01:40:41,300
But just know...

2628
01:40:41,300 --> 01:40:42,340
Yeah.

2629
01:40:42,620 --> 01:40:45,340
A Spanish streamer told me Argentina sucks.

2630
01:40:45,560 --> 01:40:46,720
I didn't know there was...

2631
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:47,060
ERA!

2632
01:40:48,340 --> 01:40:49,200
Oh, my God.

2633
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:49,920
I was looking for you.

2634
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:51,100
What was that?

2635
01:40:51,900 --> 01:40:52,660
Where are you going?

2636
01:40:53,780 --> 01:40:55,380
Where the fuck is Umi?

2637
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:56,480
Dude, he paused.

2638
01:40:57,060 --> 01:40:58,340
Two more minutes, guys.

2639
01:40:58,600 --> 01:40:59,520
Two more minutes.

2640
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:04,300
Why am I stressed out?

2641
01:41:04,620 --> 01:41:05,920
I know I'm not gonna make it.

2642
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:12,780
I shouldn't be stressed out about this.

2643
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:15,640
We all know I'm not gonna make it to the end.

2644
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:24,380
We saw the top 20 in the fucking running course.

2645
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:26,980
Jesus Christ.

2646
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:31,000
That should not be that loud.

2647
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:34,300
Like, I do not care about the ambience.

2648
01:41:38,280 --> 01:41:40,260
Please give me my cutscene.

2649
01:41:41,180 --> 01:41:41,820
Ooh.

2650
01:41:42,160 --> 01:41:43,060
Wait, what's this?

2651
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:43,840
Are these the balloons?

2652
01:41:44,260 --> 01:41:45,040
Oh, they're like balloons.

2653
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:48,120
Whoever, like...

2654
01:41:48,120 --> 01:41:50,420
The team that made this world...

2655
01:41:50,420 --> 01:41:52,020
It's actually insane, though.

2656
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:54,220
The team that made this world...

2657
01:41:54,220 --> 01:41:54,940
It's so...

2658
01:41:57,500 --> 01:41:58,620
It's so good.

2659
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:01,680
I really...

2660
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:03,560
I just love, like, all the builds and everything.

2661
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:05,600
The aesthetics and stuff of everything.

2662
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:08,260
Like, the world building.

2663
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,080
It's actually insane.

2664
01:42:11,380 --> 01:42:12,200
Wait, there's more?

2665
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:14,160
There's an outside?

2666
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:17,600
The circus?

2667
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:19,060
There's...

2668
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:21,040
Oh, my God.

2669
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:22,800
There's an outside?

2670
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:24,320
Does anybody know what this next game is?

2671
01:42:24,660 --> 01:42:26,160
I think it's, like, rock, paper, scissors.

2672
01:42:26,340 --> 01:42:28,020
But you get, like, one of the three.

2673
01:42:28,200 --> 01:42:28,640
All right.

2674
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:31,200
Holy shit.

2675
01:42:31,900 --> 01:42:32,700
Oh, my God.

2676
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:33,820
It's a deserted circus.

2677
01:42:35,140 --> 01:42:36,120
What the hell?

2678
01:42:36,660 --> 01:42:37,680
Where are the clowns at?

2679
01:42:37,940 --> 01:42:39,240
Where are the killer clowns?

2680
01:42:40,060 --> 01:42:40,700
Oh, wait.

2681
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:41,700
You can't even get up here.

2682
01:42:42,360 --> 01:42:43,200
Fucking scam.

2683
01:42:43,720 --> 01:42:44,140
Oh, my God.

2684
01:42:46,040 --> 01:42:47,100
Holy shit.

2685
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:48,900
Bro, what is this?

2686
01:42:48,900 --> 01:42:50,140
A circus for giants?

2687
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:52,000
Like, what the fuck?

2688
01:42:53,220 --> 01:42:55,420
This area is actually huge.

2689
01:42:56,420 --> 01:42:57,260
I'm scared.

2690
01:42:59,900 --> 01:43:04,380
Why do we need such a big arena for rock, paper, scissors?

2691
01:43:05,380 --> 01:43:06,400
I don't...

2692
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:07,260
I don't understand.

2693
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:13,000
If it's rock, paper, scissors, then, like, why do we need such a big area?

2694
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,840
Yeah, a cage would work.

2695
01:43:19,080 --> 01:43:20,980
Just put us in a fucking cage.

2696
01:43:24,220 --> 01:43:25,680
All right, off we go.

2697
01:43:27,820 --> 01:43:28,840
Off we go.

2698
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:35,120
See, what's so embarrassing is I actually have played Rust, of course.

2699
01:43:35,140 --> 01:43:36,360
I didn't know that.

2700
01:43:37,080 --> 01:43:38,660
Oh my god, I'm still like, oh!

2701
01:43:39,240 --> 01:43:40,540
Skull scroll blade.

2702
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:42,700
Oh, this skull I assume is...

2703
01:43:43,640 --> 01:43:44,900
Rock, paper, scissors.

2704
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:49,280
It's funny that we have a copyright-free version of rock, paper, scissors.

2705
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:52,200
Congratulations to those who made it through Lights Out.

2706
01:43:52,620 --> 01:43:57,060
The next nightmare will be a more intimate affair.

2707
01:43:58,460 --> 01:44:03,680
You will soon divide yourselves into five groups of 28 players each.

2708
01:44:04,020 --> 01:44:08,280
The Conjurer warns that people in your group will be your opponents.

2709
01:44:08,920 --> 01:44:10,720
So choose carefully.

2710
01:44:12,700 --> 01:44:21,040
Within your groups, you will be randomly pitted against different players for five matches of Skull, Scroll, and Blade.

2711
01:44:21,900 --> 01:44:25,240
Each match will consist of four rounds.

2712
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:27,340
Why do I keep choosing Skull?

2713
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:34,560
To win a round, Skull beats Blade, Blade beats Scroll, and Scroll beats Skull.

2714
01:44:36,580 --> 01:44:41,300
Each round begins with one of the two players being assigned an item.

2715
01:44:41,660 --> 01:44:42,680
Each round begins with one of the two players being assigned an item.

2716
01:44:42,700 --> 01:44:45,380
Skull, a scroll, or a blade.

2717
01:44:46,460 --> 01:44:52,020
The other player may chat with their opponent to try and figure out what item they were assigned.

2718
01:44:52,380 --> 01:44:55,140
So they can choose an item to beat it.

2719
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:58,300
Be wary of deception here.

2720
01:44:58,940 --> 01:44:59,600
The fuck?

2721
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:01,600
This is gaslighting.

2722
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:06,080
Eventually, player two will select an item in their hotbar, and a winner will be revealed.

2723
01:45:07,820 --> 01:45:12,600
Winning a round earns you two points, and losses earn you zero.

2724
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:12,680
Winning a round earns you two points, and losses earn you zero.

2725
01:45:13,700 --> 01:45:17,740
If both players draw the same item, there will be a tiebreaker.

2726
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:21,620
A red button will appear in the center of your table.

2727
01:45:22,120 --> 01:45:24,800
And the first one to click it wins one point.

2728
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:25,240
What the?

2729
01:45:27,060 --> 01:45:28,600
That's a tiebreaker?

2730
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:30,260
You will accumulate points across the five matches.

2731
01:45:30,760 --> 01:45:38,200
And at the end of the nightmare, the six players with the fewest points in each group will be eliminated.

2732
01:45:38,200 --> 01:45:39,960
Oh my god, that's gonna be me.

2733
01:45:40,220 --> 01:45:41,740
This means that today...

2734
01:45:43,340 --> 01:45:43,820
That's...

2735
01:45:43,820 --> 01:45:45,020
That's so stressful!

2736
01:45:45,300 --> 01:45:46,320
Oh my god, guys.

2737
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:47,540
It was a good run, guys.

2738
01:45:50,460 --> 01:45:52,100
I'm not a liar.

2739
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:54,220
I can't believe it.

2740
01:45:54,340 --> 01:45:55,660
I can't lie, guys.

2741
01:45:55,820 --> 01:45:57,080
I'm not known as a liar.

2742
01:45:57,220 --> 01:45:57,920
Can you hear the sound?

2743
01:45:58,100 --> 01:46:00,300
I don't know why it's playing on a different thing.

2744
01:46:00,440 --> 01:46:01,480
Okay, I need to recap.

2745
01:46:02,340 --> 01:46:04,020
Oh my god.

2746
01:46:04,120 --> 01:46:05,500
This is gonna be so difficult.

2747
01:46:05,700 --> 01:46:07,460
I'm so bad at lying.

2748
01:46:11,260 --> 01:46:12,040
I can't.

2749
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:14,500
I can't believe it.

2750
01:46:14,520 --> 01:46:16,040
I'm such a... I'm a good person.

2751
01:46:16,300 --> 01:46:19,620
Being forced to lie and gaslight people.

2752
01:46:21,420 --> 01:46:22,900
This is gonna be...

2753
01:46:22,900 --> 01:46:24,620
Locate the walk... talk to others.

2754
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:25,920
Oh, I left the five circuits.

2755
01:46:26,220 --> 01:46:28,220
Where the fuck was... Oh, it was over here.

2756
01:46:29,620 --> 01:46:31,620
We gotta go to the circuit.

2757
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:34,280
The person to my left always tells a lie.

2758
01:46:36,640 --> 01:46:37,740
Alright, there you go.

2759
01:46:37,740 --> 01:46:38,700
We found the circus.

2760
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:40,280
Hey, it's me.

2761
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:41,180
It's Gabigool.

2762
01:46:41,500 --> 01:46:42,680
New Jersey.

2763
01:46:43,380 --> 01:46:45,800
We found it.

2764
01:46:46,020 --> 01:46:47,940
We found the circus.

2765
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:49,600
Rigatoni with the Red Souls.

2766
01:46:49,780 --> 01:46:51,180
How do I...

2767
01:46:51,180 --> 01:46:53,400
I'm trying to think how to...

2768
01:46:54,280 --> 01:46:54,860
Linguini.

2769
01:46:55,400 --> 01:46:56,140
Yes.

2770
01:46:57,180 --> 01:46:59,840
I keep ordering their Uber Eats right now.

2771
01:47:00,660 --> 01:47:02,400
Farm of John.

2772
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:03,940
Farmer John.

2773
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:05,480
Farmer John.

2774
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:07,020
Why are we intruding on a date?

2775
01:47:09,740 --> 01:47:11,140
I'm just this third wheel.

2776
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:13,460
Just listening to their fucking pasta order.

2777
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:18,420
I'm just like, what the hell?

2778
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:20,300
Oh, hey!

2779
01:47:20,780 --> 01:47:21,220
Goodie!

2780
01:47:21,320 --> 01:47:21,960
There you are!

2781
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:23,600
Here I am.

2782
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,420
This game is gonna be so difficult.

2783
01:47:25,420 --> 01:47:26,400
Did you see my DM, by the way?

2784
01:47:26,540 --> 01:47:28,020
Oh, you DM'd me?

2785
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:30,320
Yeah, I just saw them.

2786
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:31,120
Oh!

2787
01:47:31,860 --> 01:47:32,780
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2788
01:47:32,820 --> 01:47:33,320
I saw it.

2789
01:47:33,320 --> 01:47:34,700
Yeah, I saw them earlier too.

2790
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:35,760
In the first round.

2791
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:38,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2792
01:47:38,820 --> 01:47:40,080
Don't worry, don't worry.

2793
01:47:40,220 --> 01:47:41,020
Don't get eliminated.

2794
01:47:41,560 --> 01:47:41,860
Protect me!

2795
01:47:42,020 --> 01:47:43,580
Don't worry, I'll protect you!

2796
01:47:45,700 --> 01:47:46,440
Oh my god.

2797
01:47:47,640 --> 01:47:49,180
This game is gonna be so difficult.

2798
01:47:49,420 --> 01:47:50,900
Because, like, you have to lie.

2799
01:47:51,080 --> 01:47:51,600
And I don't...

2800
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:53,680
And I always tell the truth.

2801
01:47:54,020 --> 01:47:54,400
Shut up!

2802
01:47:56,320 --> 01:47:57,280
Shut up!

2803
01:47:57,980 --> 01:47:58,940
What do you mean?

2804
01:47:59,580 --> 01:48:00,500
Stop talking!

2805
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:04,720
This is so difficult!

2806
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:06,260
Oh my god.

2807
01:48:07,020 --> 01:48:08,060
It's like we're on a giant.

2808
01:48:08,460 --> 01:48:09,000
Wait, wait.

2809
01:48:09,060 --> 01:48:10,520
We're gonna form an alliance, right?

2810
01:48:11,540 --> 01:48:12,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2811
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:16,800
So, like, when you fight me, let me win because I'll lose... I'll get kicked out.

2812
01:48:17,100 --> 01:48:18,340
Well, it's whoever has less points.

2813
01:48:18,440 --> 01:48:20,920
Yeah, yeah, but you'll let me farm points off of you, right?

2814
01:48:21,180 --> 01:48:21,380
Hello!

2815
01:48:21,620 --> 01:48:21,980
Hello!

2816
01:48:22,140 --> 01:48:24,400
Well, only if I have more points than you.

2817
01:48:24,860 --> 01:48:25,400
Yeah, yeah.

2818
01:48:25,460 --> 01:48:27,280
And you'll always have more points than me.

2819
01:48:27,320 --> 01:48:28,160
You're a Minecraft player.

2820
01:48:29,660 --> 01:48:31,880
Girl, this game ain't got nothing to do with Minecraft.

2821
01:48:32,120 --> 01:48:33,040
You're a Minecraft...

2822
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:35,140
Yeah, but people... people trust you!

2823
01:48:36,140 --> 01:48:36,720
That's true!

2824
01:48:37,420 --> 01:48:38,740
And people also trust me, too.

2825
01:48:38,820 --> 01:48:40,400
But, like, I'm just way too trustworthy.

2826
01:48:40,700 --> 01:48:41,140
Sophie, no one trusts you.

2827
01:48:44,180 --> 01:48:46,400
You let me farm points off of you, right?

2828
01:48:46,980 --> 01:48:48,840
You let me farm points off of you.

2829
01:48:49,080 --> 01:48:49,520
Right?

2830
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:52,480
If I get eliminated, who will bring the content?

2831
01:48:53,140 --> 01:48:54,600
I have bad luck.

2832
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:56,040
But...

2833
01:48:56,940 --> 01:48:58,440
I only have good luck when...

2834
01:48:59,020 --> 01:48:59,800
when it doesn't matter.

2835
01:49:00,160 --> 01:49:00,780
It's okay.

2836
01:49:00,940 --> 01:49:04,440
When you're up against me, just pick... just pick Blade.

2837
01:49:04,680 --> 01:49:05,080
Okay?

2838
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:07,020
Every time, you pick Blade.

2839
01:49:08,440 --> 01:49:10,740
I... I'm gonna... I'm gonna pick...

2840
01:49:10,740 --> 01:49:12,300
I'm gonna pick the biggest brain.

2841
01:49:12,340 --> 01:49:13,400
The biggest brain.

2842
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:16,080
Wait, Gumi, what is it?

2843
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:17,080
What is it, Gumi?

2844
01:49:18,640 --> 01:49:20,120
Oh, wait, she's AFK.

2845
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:20,660
Never mind.

2846
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:22,860
It's okay, guys.

2847
01:49:22,940 --> 01:49:24,060
We got this, guys.

2848
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:28,400
Gumi will let me farm points off of her, so I won't be bottom six, guys.

2849
01:49:28,660 --> 01:49:29,980
Of 28 people.

2850
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:31,260
There's no way.

2851
01:49:32,540 --> 01:49:33,180
No way.

2852
01:49:33,460 --> 01:49:34,920
Of 28 people.

2853
01:49:36,780 --> 01:49:38,220
I refuse to be...

2854
01:49:38,220 --> 01:49:40,100
the worst player.

2855
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:45,140
I'm channeling all of my lucky charms I had in my serial last week.

2856
01:49:45,980 --> 01:49:48,160
Yeah, yeah, just pick Blade when you're up against me.

2857
01:49:48,300 --> 01:49:49,080
Just pick Blade.

2858
01:49:50,140 --> 01:49:51,500
What happened to...

2859
01:49:52,420 --> 01:49:54,320
Yeah, yeah, Gumi, pick Blade.

2860
01:49:54,340 --> 01:49:56,500
Pick Blade when you're...

2861
01:49:56,500 --> 01:49:57,380
What if you have scroll?

2862
01:49:58,480 --> 01:49:59,300
There's no way.

2863
01:49:59,440 --> 01:49:59,800
There's no...

2864
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:00,620
I don't lie.

2865
01:50:00,740 --> 01:50:01,400
I tell the truth.

2866
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:02,000
Just pick Blade.

2867
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:03,720
What do you mean?

2868
01:50:03,780 --> 01:50:04,600
You don't even know.

2869
01:50:04,720 --> 01:50:05,680
You're lying to yourself.

2870
01:50:05,940 --> 01:50:07,100
No, I'm gonna pick scroll.

2871
01:50:07,700 --> 01:50:09,220
That's why I told you pick Blade.

2872
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:12,100
You can't pick scroll.

2873
01:50:12,160 --> 01:50:12,900
You get RNG.

2874
01:50:13,020 --> 01:50:13,680
Give it one.

2875
01:50:14,780 --> 01:50:15,180
Oh.

2876
01:50:15,980 --> 01:50:16,980
No, I get three.

2877
01:50:17,300 --> 01:50:19,340
No, they said they give you three and you get the pick.

2878
01:50:19,380 --> 01:50:20,480
That's if you're opposing them.

2879
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:22,740
That's if you're the opposing side.

2880
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:24,000
What?

2881
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:24,740
I don't...

2882
01:50:25,700 --> 01:50:28,700
Okay, so there's two people sitting at the table, yes?

2883
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:29,020
Yeah.

2884
01:50:29,020 --> 01:50:29,940
There's two people sitting at the table.

2885
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:37,180
One of them, you don't know who you are, but one of them gets given a randomized scroll, blade, or skull.

2886
01:50:37,480 --> 01:50:41,300
And the other person has to guess which one that person got.

2887
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:43,960
Only one person gets to choose.

2888
01:50:45,560 --> 01:50:46,580
That's fucking stupid.

2889
01:50:46,580 --> 01:50:47,140
Not both of them.

2890
01:50:47,960 --> 01:50:50,440
Wait, my whole plan.

2891
01:50:50,900 --> 01:50:51,880
My whole plan.

2892
01:50:52,940 --> 01:50:54,460
I'm gonna take that as a yes you.

2893
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:56,320
My whole plan.

2894
01:50:57,900 --> 01:50:58,300
Okay.

2895
01:50:58,380 --> 01:51:02,160
Okay, when you're up against me, I will always tell the truth.

2896
01:51:02,280 --> 01:51:02,980
You'll tell me?

2897
01:51:03,080 --> 01:51:03,700
You'll tell me?

2898
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:04,660
I'll always tell the truth.

2899
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:05,700
And you'll let me farm.

2900
01:51:05,740 --> 01:51:08,060
And you'll let me farm off of you so I won't get eliminated.

2901
01:51:09,200 --> 01:51:10,280
Yeah, you're gonna tell...

2902
01:51:10,280 --> 01:51:11,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2903
01:51:13,080 --> 01:51:13,480
Yo.

2904
01:51:14,060 --> 01:51:14,460
Hey.

2905
01:51:14,720 --> 01:51:17,700
Oh my god, my entire plan.

2906
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:18,400
It's over.

2907
01:51:19,220 --> 01:51:20,260
It's so over.

2908
01:51:21,020 --> 01:51:23,200
It was just not clicking in your head.

2909
01:51:23,240 --> 01:51:23,600
You're like, what?

2910
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,740
I thought it was just regular rock, paper, scissors.

2911
01:51:29,740 --> 01:51:30,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2912
01:51:30,820 --> 01:51:31,160
Two seconds.

2913
01:51:32,460 --> 01:51:33,800
Are you going into our lobby?

2914
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:34,600
Do you trust us?

2915
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:36,320
Yeah.

2916
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:37,960
Wait, how do we pick colors?

2917
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:40,040
Oh, you see around the map?

2918
01:51:40,680 --> 01:51:41,540
Listen, listen, Doki.

2919
01:51:41,620 --> 01:51:42,040
No, no, listen.

2920
01:51:42,340 --> 01:51:42,740
Yeah?

2921
01:51:43,180 --> 01:51:45,540
We can team up, okay?

2922
01:51:45,680 --> 01:51:47,720
We don't know who we'll play against.

2923
01:51:47,800 --> 01:51:48,960
It's 28 people per lobby.

2924
01:51:50,180 --> 01:51:51,620
We can farm each other.

2925
01:51:52,140 --> 01:51:52,920
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

2926
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:53,600
There's a text.

2927
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:55,560
There's a text that the Minecrafters were telling me.

2928
01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:56,760
What's the text?

2929
01:51:56,780 --> 01:52:06,820
They were telling me, basically, you make an alliance, and in your alliance, if you go against each other, whoever has more points, they lose on purpose to the person who has less points.

2930
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:09,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's do that.

2931
01:52:09,660 --> 01:52:12,320
I didn't say that in my more complex words, though.

2932
01:52:12,360 --> 01:52:13,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2933
01:52:14,200 --> 01:52:14,640
Oh!

2934
01:52:15,140 --> 01:52:15,580
Whoa!

2935
01:52:17,540 --> 01:52:19,900
Oh my god, we didn't even find any lights!

2936
01:52:21,400 --> 01:52:21,520
Whoa!

2937
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:23,600
Wait, wait, what color?

2938
01:52:23,600 --> 01:52:24,360
Boost me, boost me!

2939
01:52:25,060 --> 01:52:25,380
Boost!

2940
01:52:27,560 --> 01:52:28,440
Ducky, Ducky, Ducky!

2941
01:52:28,860 --> 01:52:29,460
I'm not lost!

2942
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:31,980
Let's go this way.

2943
01:52:33,320 --> 01:52:34,520
Where do we go, where do we go?

2944
01:52:35,300 --> 01:52:36,000
We're turning around.

2945
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:39,320
Where do we go, where do we go?

2946
01:52:40,160 --> 01:52:41,060
I'm so confused!

2947
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:43,480
Oh my god, Sleepy's making us confused!

2948
01:52:44,260 --> 01:52:44,840
E-Rob, E-Rob!

2949
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:47,040
Where do we go, which color?

2950
01:52:47,740 --> 01:52:48,720
We got a group, we got a group.

2951
01:52:49,300 --> 01:52:50,520
Where's Abe, where the fuck is Abe?

2952
01:52:50,540 --> 01:52:50,900
Where did Abe go?

2953
01:52:51,140 --> 01:52:52,060
He got lost!

2954
01:52:52,160 --> 01:52:52,480
I don't know!

2955
01:52:52,520 --> 01:52:52,920
I don't know!

2956
01:52:53,860 --> 01:52:54,940
Where's Guapo, man?

2957
01:52:55,200 --> 01:52:56,260
We all got lost!

2958
01:52:57,360 --> 01:52:58,680
Go in there, go in the pink!

2959
01:52:59,880 --> 01:53:01,660
Oh no, it's already over.

2960
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:03,820
Oh god, they're filling up, guys, they're filling up real quick.

2961
01:53:03,820 --> 01:53:05,020
Oh, we have to pick one color.

2962
01:53:05,240 --> 01:53:06,380
What do we do?

2963
01:53:06,700 --> 01:53:07,960
Where did Abe go?

2964
01:53:08,760 --> 01:53:10,960
Oh, there's Abe, there's Abe, there's Abe!

2965
01:53:11,660 --> 01:53:13,200
Blue, blue, blue, go blue, go blue!

2966
01:53:13,380 --> 01:53:13,920
Blue, blue, blue!

2967
01:53:14,020 --> 01:53:16,440
Blue is filling up, though!

2968
01:53:18,240 --> 01:53:19,600
What if we don't make it?

2969
01:53:19,660 --> 01:53:21,020
Yeah, what if we don't make it?

2970
01:53:21,020 --> 01:53:21,800
We have to split up.

2971
01:53:21,940 --> 01:53:22,340
Okay, we split.

2972
01:53:22,680 --> 01:53:22,860
We split.

2973
01:53:24,380 --> 01:53:24,760
Okay.

2974
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:26,880
Okay, we're good, we're fine.

2975
01:53:27,740 --> 01:53:29,740
We're fine, we're fine, we're fine, we're fine.

2976
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:30,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2977
01:53:32,080 --> 01:53:33,560
Wait, what if they have a bigger team?

2978
01:53:35,560 --> 01:53:36,300
I'm picking rock.

2979
01:53:37,440 --> 01:53:38,240
I'm picking rock.

2980
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:40,540
Get in here, get in here, get in here.

2981
01:53:41,780 --> 01:53:44,540
You can be, you can be mentally fortified.

2982
01:53:44,980 --> 01:53:47,100
It's not gonna change the fact that I'm picking rock.

2983
01:53:49,620 --> 01:53:51,820
Wait, Kumi, what are you doing?

2984
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:53,580
Wait, Kumi, what are you doing?

2985
01:53:53,600 --> 01:53:54,020
Sleepy.

2986
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:55,760
What are you picking?

2987
01:53:56,100 --> 01:53:58,180
I'm scared, Kumi left.

2988
01:53:58,640 --> 01:54:00,200
Get in here, get on the platform.

2989
01:54:01,120 --> 01:54:03,460
You're not as fortified as I am.

2990
01:54:03,500 --> 01:54:04,740
Kumi, Kumi left!

2991
01:54:06,060 --> 01:54:06,540
Whoa!

2992
01:54:07,920 --> 01:54:10,000
Where did Kumi go?

2993
01:54:10,280 --> 01:54:10,360
Yeah.

2994
01:54:12,020 --> 01:54:13,540
Kumi, Kumi, are you not doing?

2995
01:54:13,680 --> 01:54:14,140
Yeah?

2996
01:54:15,540 --> 01:54:16,020
What?

2997
01:54:17,140 --> 01:54:17,920
Oh, you're right, you're right.

2998
01:54:18,220 --> 01:54:18,580
He's right.

2999
01:54:18,680 --> 01:54:19,300
Sleepy, sleepy.

3000
01:54:19,300 --> 01:54:20,800
Use two of your brain cells.

3001
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:22,040
Use two of your brain cells.

3002
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:22,740
Hey, what the heck was that?

3003
01:54:22,820 --> 01:54:23,140
Who hit me?

3004
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:25,160
What the hell was that?

3005
01:54:25,200 --> 01:54:25,420
Hey!

3006
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:26,740
Look what you're looking at.

3007
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:28,880
Oh yeah, we can stay here, we can stay here.

3008
01:54:29,540 --> 01:54:30,520
Stop hitting each other!

3009
01:54:31,160 --> 01:54:31,660
I want to talk to you.

3010
01:54:33,160 --> 01:54:34,100
I need Reggie.

3011
01:54:35,660 --> 01:54:37,400
You've thought, you've thought about it.

3012
01:54:38,040 --> 01:54:39,380
I was here before you thought.

3013
01:54:41,360 --> 01:54:42,220
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

3014
01:54:44,300 --> 01:54:44,980
We're cool, we're cool.

3015
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:51,460
I don't know if you're whispering about something, but I can't hear you now.

3016
01:54:52,040 --> 01:54:53,240
I'm just saying we're good, we're good.

3017
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:54,640
We're cool, we're cool.

3018
01:54:56,360 --> 01:54:57,320
Are we cool?

3019
01:54:58,340 --> 01:54:59,160
We're so cool.

3020
01:54:59,280 --> 01:54:59,760
Are we cool?

3021
01:55:02,260 --> 01:55:02,600
What?

3022
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:06,100
I think the other groups have bigger alliances than us.

3023
01:55:06,500 --> 01:55:07,600
But that's okay, that's okay.

3024
01:55:07,640 --> 01:55:08,520
We got this, we got this.

3025
01:55:10,060 --> 01:55:10,860
Are you in?

3026
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:13,620
Don't get knocked out.

3027
01:55:13,680 --> 01:55:14,740
It's almost full, it's almost full.

3028
01:55:17,820 --> 01:55:18,420
We're back in!

3029
01:55:18,580 --> 01:55:19,740
We're a team, we're a team, we're a team!

3030
01:55:20,500 --> 01:55:21,760
No beef, no beef, I'm sorry.

3031
01:55:22,040 --> 01:55:23,560
I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared.

3032
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:26,880
Sleepy, sleepy, sleepy.

3033
01:55:27,020 --> 01:55:27,480
I got a plan.

3034
01:55:28,100 --> 01:55:30,880
Oh, they're kicking people out, they're kicking people out.

3035
01:55:31,120 --> 01:55:33,460
20 times in a row.

3036
01:55:33,860 --> 01:55:36,400
One rematch up against each other.

3037
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:41,980
I'm scared, I'm scared of getting knocked out.

3038
01:55:42,040 --> 01:55:43,340
I'm scared of getting locked out.

3039
01:55:43,540 --> 01:55:48,040
I'm gonna read their minds.

3040
01:55:48,880 --> 01:55:51,120
I'm gonna crunch the numbers and do the math.

3041
01:55:52,620 --> 01:55:54,560
Yeah, Samuelson, you're gonna do all that?

3042
01:55:54,720 --> 01:55:57,240
Whoa, whoa, I'm not Samuelson, I'm Sam's little brother right now.

3043
01:55:57,560 --> 01:55:59,240
Oh, what's your name?

3044
01:55:59,640 --> 01:56:03,180
Yeah, well, oh, my name's Lil Sam.

3045
01:56:04,060 --> 01:56:04,940
Lil Sam?

3046
01:56:07,160 --> 01:56:10,600
I mean, regardless, this is up to chance anyways.

3047
01:56:10,780 --> 01:56:12,180
Yeah, it doesn't get any better.

3048
01:56:12,420 --> 01:56:14,120
He had to throw me off.

3049
01:56:14,420 --> 01:56:16,500
Every team's gonna have a bunch of faces we recognize.

3050
01:56:17,360 --> 01:56:18,820
How do we choose?

3051
01:56:20,280 --> 01:56:25,600
Also, I'm not gonna lie here, the other teams we haven't checked out are all gonna have like HPG, like a bunch of them.

3052
01:56:26,440 --> 01:56:26,720
What?

3053
01:56:28,080 --> 01:56:29,140
I said frick you!

3054
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:31,980
Oh, yeah, yeah, I know, I know.

3055
01:56:32,060 --> 01:56:32,780
I'll do the same.

3056
01:56:35,660 --> 01:56:41,040
According to the mathematics, you should average one point per game, so if you're like 10 games in, you should have around 10 points.

3057
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:41,800
I'm scared, guys, I'm scared.

3058
01:56:42,700 --> 01:56:44,560
I'm so scared.

3059
01:56:44,840 --> 01:56:45,860
You know what I mean?

3060
01:56:46,660 --> 01:56:46,940
Yeah?

3061
01:56:50,280 --> 01:56:50,860
There's a common...

3062
01:56:50,860 --> 01:56:53,220
If you're not at one point per game...

3063
01:56:53,580 --> 01:56:54,420
Yeah, yeah, then it's...

3064
01:56:57,940 --> 01:56:58,660
Is it?

3065
01:57:02,220 --> 01:57:03,660
We have to make sure the women win.

3066
01:57:04,520 --> 01:57:06,160
Oh, okay, you and I are both women.

3067
01:57:06,340 --> 01:57:08,000
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3068
01:57:08,700 --> 01:57:10,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3069
01:57:10,580 --> 01:57:13,520
So that means you gotta make sure I live through the next round.

3070
01:57:13,680 --> 01:57:14,360
You gotta make sure.

3071
01:57:14,580 --> 01:57:16,400
Girl, you can make sure of yourself.

3072
01:57:16,760 --> 01:57:18,140
No, no, this is a...

3073
01:57:18,140 --> 01:57:19,200
This is a group effort!

3074
01:57:24,900 --> 01:57:26,840
This is a group effort!

3075
01:57:26,900 --> 01:57:27,460
This is a group effort, Gooby!

3076
01:57:27,620 --> 01:57:27,700
This is a group effort, Gooby!

3077
01:57:27,700 --> 01:57:28,460
I'm nervous.

3078
01:57:28,740 --> 01:57:31,780
I forgot that it actually hits.

3079
01:57:31,900 --> 01:57:33,780
Oh my god, that's fucked up!

3080
01:57:35,740 --> 01:57:36,940
That's messed up.

3081
01:57:37,240 --> 01:57:37,380
That's messed up.

3082
01:57:37,560 --> 01:57:39,540
I did not mean to hit you.

3083
01:57:39,560 --> 01:57:41,780
Oh, email only.

3084
01:57:41,800 --> 01:57:43,300
Don't worry, we already have email only.

3085
01:57:43,500 --> 01:57:44,420
I'm sorry, my apologies.

3086
01:57:46,030 --> 01:57:46,300
Because...

3087
01:57:46,300 --> 01:57:47,740
You win, I win, okay?

3088
01:57:48,200 --> 01:57:49,940
Oh, gosh!

3089
01:57:52,200 --> 01:57:52,680
Ava!

3090
01:57:52,680 --> 01:57:56,040
I'm thinking, guys, when we face each other, do not draw.

3091
01:57:58,500 --> 01:57:59,460
Oh, goodbye!

3092
01:58:01,860 --> 01:58:03,880
What if you get kicked out before the round starts?

3093
01:58:05,840 --> 01:58:06,320
Oh!

3094
01:58:10,740 --> 01:58:14,080
We have one minute, Abe, to get you in here.

3095
01:58:14,080 --> 01:58:14,680
Yeah, yeah.

3096
01:58:15,320 --> 01:58:19,680
Yeah, you want your friend to have a good time, like, if I'm doing well, and...

3097
01:58:19,680 --> 01:58:20,940
Oh my god.

3098
01:58:23,080 --> 01:58:24,920
It gets kicked out!

3099
01:58:24,960 --> 01:58:26,200
You see, it's not in.

3100
01:58:26,200 --> 01:58:26,680
I got it.

3101
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:29,180
One minute left, Abe!

3102
01:58:34,630 --> 01:58:35,830
Oh, shit!

3103
01:58:36,070 --> 01:58:36,770
Oh, shit!

3104
01:58:36,770 --> 01:58:36,930
Oh, shit!

3105
01:58:36,930 --> 01:58:38,410
Gooby, gooby, gooby, gooby, gooby, gooby!

3106
01:58:38,670 --> 01:58:42,430
Gooby, gooby, gooby, gooby, gooby, gooby, gooby!

3107
01:58:43,190 --> 01:58:45,690
Gooby, gooby, gooby, gooby, gooby, gooby, gooby, gooby!

3108
01:58:45,690 --> 01:58:48,550
Only five people in the elevator get kicked out!

3109
01:58:49,190 --> 01:58:50,770
We're kicking you off the team, Abe.

3110
01:58:55,110 --> 01:58:57,130
What happens if you're not in the circle?

3111
01:58:57,270 --> 01:58:59,510
Yeah, that's what we're trying to figure out.

3112
01:58:59,570 --> 01:59:01,430
If Abe's not in the circle...

3113
01:59:01,430 --> 01:59:03,470
Oh, Abe, Abe, you're being sacrificed.

3114
01:59:08,850 --> 01:59:10,070
Good luck, Abe!

3115
01:59:10,570 --> 01:59:11,530
Fifty seconds!

3116
01:59:14,090 --> 01:59:15,050
Fifty seconds!

3117
01:59:15,690 --> 01:59:16,230
No, we can do that.

3118
01:59:16,350 --> 01:59:17,730
We just need to win two minutes.

3119
01:59:17,730 --> 01:59:18,710
And then that's eight points.

3120
01:59:18,750 --> 01:59:19,450
Abe, get in!

3121
01:59:24,510 --> 01:59:25,430
Free Elif!

3122
01:59:25,630 --> 01:59:26,650
Free Elif!

3123
01:59:29,470 --> 01:59:30,390
Holy shit!

3124
01:59:33,670 --> 01:59:35,990
I better hope you're not going up against me.

3125
01:59:37,490 --> 01:59:38,290
Oh, shit!

3126
01:59:39,450 --> 01:59:40,370
Well, well, well...

3127
01:59:40,370 --> 01:59:40,930
Hello!

3128
01:59:43,750 --> 01:59:44,210
So...

3129
01:59:45,690 --> 01:59:49,430
You probably want to know what item I was assigned, don't you?

3130
01:59:49,550 --> 01:59:50,390
Yeah, yeah.

3131
01:59:50,470 --> 01:59:51,810
I mean, you wouldn't lie to me, right?

3132
01:59:52,790 --> 01:59:54,350
Wouldn't you like to know?

3133
01:59:54,650 --> 01:59:55,530
I'd love to know!

3134
01:59:56,190 --> 01:59:59,410
Alright, five gifted subs if you tell me what you have right now.

3135
01:59:59,730 --> 02:00:01,670
I actually developed a strategy.

3136
02:00:01,790 --> 02:00:02,890
You gotta listen to the mathematics.

3137
02:00:03,010 --> 02:00:04,010
Okay, okay, I'm listening.

3138
02:00:04,410 --> 02:00:09,790
So, on average, if you get at least one point a game, you should be fine.

3139
02:00:10,570 --> 02:00:11,070
But...

3140
02:00:11,070 --> 02:00:16,690
the outcome out of each round is usually two points, unless we draw.

3141
02:00:16,810 --> 02:00:19,810
And if we draw, then the outcome is one point's net.

3142
02:00:20,210 --> 02:00:22,190
So, if we just trade wins...

3143
02:00:22,190 --> 02:00:23,650
Oh, that's so smart!

3144
02:00:24,730 --> 02:00:26,070
Yeah, you wanna do that?

3145
02:00:26,350 --> 02:00:28,750
Oh my god!

3146
02:00:28,830 --> 02:00:29,590
You cooked me!

3147
02:00:30,730 --> 02:00:32,570
Sorry, can you explain again?

3148
02:00:32,710 --> 02:00:33,990
You actually wanna do that!

3149
02:00:34,170 --> 02:00:35,490
No, I got confused!

3150
02:00:38,550 --> 02:00:40,070
We trade wins.

3151
02:00:40,670 --> 02:00:41,150
So...

3152
02:00:41,150 --> 02:00:43,010
You won the first one.

3153
02:00:43,210 --> 02:00:45,550
Yeah, so then I let you win the next one, right?

3154
02:00:46,570 --> 02:00:48,650
Yes, and then you won the one after that.

3155
02:00:48,850 --> 02:00:49,750
And then...

3156
02:00:49,750 --> 02:00:51,490
I won that one after that.

3157
02:00:52,270 --> 02:00:53,230
And then...

3158
02:00:53,730 --> 02:00:56,550
I guess the last one will just end up to chance.

3159
02:00:56,830 --> 02:00:58,130
Okay, yeah, that sounds fun.

3160
02:00:59,790 --> 02:01:02,210
I'm so serious about this too.

3161
02:01:02,430 --> 02:01:03,190
I'm so serious.

3162
02:01:03,370 --> 02:01:06,670
Tell me what you have, I will let you win again.

3163
02:01:07,550 --> 02:01:08,310
And then...

3164
02:01:10,070 --> 02:01:10,250
Can I trust?

3165
02:01:11,450 --> 02:01:12,490
Yes, yes, yes.

3166
02:01:12,670 --> 02:01:14,850
Okay, I have a blade.

3167
02:01:14,910 --> 02:01:15,710
I'm so serious!

3168
02:01:18,050 --> 02:01:19,530
Why would I lie to you?

3169
02:01:20,710 --> 02:01:21,930
I'm so serious!

3170
02:01:22,250 --> 02:01:23,050
I'm so serious!

3171
02:01:23,050 --> 02:01:24,650
If you lie, this is actually messed up.

3172
02:01:26,030 --> 02:01:27,310
Okay, oh my god!

3173
02:01:27,910 --> 02:01:29,270
Wait, you lied to me!

3174
02:01:30,050 --> 02:01:32,130
I forgot I was letting you win!

3175
02:01:32,270 --> 02:01:33,290
Okay, I'll tell you what I have now.

3176
02:01:33,470 --> 02:01:33,850
Oh, okay.

3177
02:01:35,310 --> 02:01:37,210
I actually didn't even... I have paper.

3178
02:01:37,790 --> 02:01:38,650
You have paper?

3179
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:42,190
I actually have paper, I'm not trolling.

3180
02:01:42,510 --> 02:01:43,730
You're actually not trolling?

3181
02:01:44,710 --> 02:01:47,370
Yes, I have paper, so you go knife.

3182
02:01:47,890 --> 02:01:48,290
Okay.

3183
02:01:48,870 --> 02:01:49,270
Yeah.

3184
02:01:49,710 --> 02:01:50,110
Right?

3185
02:01:50,410 --> 02:01:51,250
That's how you go.

3186
02:01:52,650 --> 02:01:54,110
But like, what if you lied to me?

3187
02:01:54,910 --> 02:01:56,830
I swear to you I'm not lying.

3188
02:01:56,990 --> 02:01:59,090
I know I just tricked you, but I swear...

3189
02:01:59,090 --> 02:02:01,410
Wait, I thought you said it was an accident earlier.

3190
02:02:01,570 --> 02:02:03,350
That means you were purposely tricking me.

3191
02:02:05,310 --> 02:02:06,690
I'm actually just dumb.

3192
02:02:06,730 --> 02:02:07,130
I'm so serious.

3193
02:02:07,130 --> 02:02:08,670
Oh, now you're just dumb.

3194
02:02:08,790 --> 02:02:09,430
Oh, I see.

3195
02:02:10,350 --> 02:02:11,770
I'm actually just dumb.

3196
02:02:11,890 --> 02:02:13,070
I have paper, though.

3197
02:02:13,250 --> 02:02:14,110
Oh, okay.

3198
02:02:16,510 --> 02:02:17,790
So, like, do we just wait?

3199
02:02:19,410 --> 02:02:22,050
Well, you choose knife, right?

3200
02:02:22,130 --> 02:02:22,550
You choose knife.

3201
02:02:22,570 --> 02:02:22,610
Yeah.

3202
02:02:23,230 --> 02:02:24,030
Does he have knife?

3203
02:02:25,930 --> 02:02:27,550
Oh, you did have paper.

3204
02:02:29,230 --> 02:02:29,670
Oh...

3205
02:02:29,670 --> 02:02:31,290
You don't trust me, huh?

3206
02:02:31,630 --> 02:02:33,150
I mean, you didn't trust me, too.

3207
02:02:34,550 --> 02:02:35,850
I'm actually an idiot.

3208
02:02:35,910 --> 02:02:37,630
I actually messed it up the second time.

3209
02:02:37,630 --> 02:02:39,390
You messed it up the second time?

3210
02:02:39,510 --> 02:02:40,430
Like, what do you mean by that?

3211
02:02:40,810 --> 02:02:42,530
No, like, on round two, I'm...

3212
02:02:42,530 --> 02:02:43,970
No, wait, no, on round...

3213
02:02:45,010 --> 02:02:45,910
I don't even know.

3214
02:02:46,050 --> 02:02:46,470
I don't know.

3215
02:02:46,690 --> 02:02:47,090
You know what?

3216
02:02:47,650 --> 02:02:48,570
Let's just make it...

3217
02:02:48,570 --> 02:02:49,370
Let's make it special.

3218
02:02:49,490 --> 02:02:49,990
Let's not...

3219
02:02:49,990 --> 02:02:53,430
I won't even tell you what I have, because I actually didn't look, so...

3220
02:02:54,470 --> 02:02:56,390
I don't even know what I have.

3221
02:03:00,810 --> 02:03:01,170
Okay.

3222
02:03:02,050 --> 02:03:02,630
Yeah, what could...

3223
02:03:02,630 --> 02:03:03,430
We could have worked together.

3224
02:03:03,610 --> 02:03:04,510
This could have been fine.

3225
02:03:05,550 --> 02:03:09,030
I mean, I did try to work together with you, but you didn't even...

3226
02:03:09,030 --> 02:03:11,150
I will give you this one if you tell me what you have.

3227
02:03:11,410 --> 02:03:12,050
What I have?

3228
02:03:12,190 --> 02:03:13,470
I think I have paper.

3229
02:03:13,770 --> 02:03:13,970
No, I tricked you on the second one because I'm an idiot.

3230
02:03:15,030 --> 02:03:16,130
I think it was paper.

3231
02:03:16,350 --> 02:03:17,110
I don't remember.

3232
02:03:19,650 --> 02:03:20,690
Or was it rock?

3233
02:03:21,210 --> 02:03:22,390
I think it was rock.

3234
02:03:22,390 --> 02:03:23,410
It was rock or paper.

3235
02:03:25,570 --> 02:03:26,210
Oh, see?

3236
02:03:26,390 --> 02:03:27,150
You're a liar.

3237
02:03:27,310 --> 02:03:28,830
I'm gonna tell my group about you.

3238
02:03:29,590 --> 02:03:31,930
I'm gonna tell my group about you that you're a liar.

3239
02:03:32,150 --> 02:03:33,070
I'm packing you up right now!

3240
02:03:33,390 --> 02:03:34,910
I'm packing you up right now!

3241
02:03:34,910 --> 02:03:36,090
Oh, no!

3242
02:03:37,410 --> 02:03:38,910
Don't play Tiny Mac, dude!

3243
02:03:38,950 --> 02:03:40,750
Don't play Tiny Mac!

3244
02:03:41,290 --> 02:03:42,930
Don't trust Squid.

3245
02:03:43,330 --> 02:03:44,910
Don't trust Squid.

3246
02:03:44,950 --> 02:03:45,650
He's a liar.

3247
02:03:50,490 --> 02:03:51,490
Squid's a liar.

3248
02:03:51,650 --> 02:03:52,510
Don't trust him.

3249
02:03:52,850 --> 02:03:53,990
Who's a liar?

3250
02:03:55,170 --> 02:03:55,770
Squid.

3251
02:03:55,770 --> 02:03:56,710
Squid's a liar?

3252
02:03:56,770 --> 02:03:56,950
Yeah.

3253
02:03:57,010 --> 02:03:58,190
Don't trust Squid.

3254
02:03:59,150 --> 02:03:59,570
What about you?

3255
02:03:59,870 --> 02:04:00,270
Doki.

3256
02:04:01,570 --> 02:04:02,770
Count how many you won.

3257
02:04:02,890 --> 02:04:04,710
It's what we talked about.

3258
02:04:05,330 --> 02:04:06,390
Dora, I'm sorry.

3259
02:04:06,470 --> 02:04:07,250
I'm not lying.

3260
02:04:07,390 --> 02:04:08,010
I know.

3261
02:04:08,830 --> 02:04:09,550
I know.

3262
02:04:09,610 --> 02:04:09,730
I see.

3263
02:04:09,730 --> 02:04:10,350
I'm not lying.

3264
02:04:10,410 --> 02:04:13,070
I told my group about you!

3265
02:04:13,890 --> 02:04:17,170
I told my group about you!

3266
02:04:17,170 --> 02:04:17,190
No!

3267
02:04:17,190 --> 02:04:17,830
I'm sorry.

3268
02:04:18,270 --> 02:04:20,050
I appreciate you telling me about you.

3269
02:04:20,470 --> 02:04:21,790
I admit myself wrong.

3270
02:04:23,230 --> 02:04:24,990
You just lied to me.

3271
02:04:25,350 --> 02:04:26,730
I need to be back in the room.

3272
02:04:26,830 --> 02:04:27,710
I need to be back in the room.

3273
02:04:27,750 --> 02:04:28,330
This is too loud.

3274
02:04:28,470 --> 02:04:29,110
Too loud.

3275
02:04:29,270 --> 02:04:31,310
You said Skull and it was Skrull.

3276
02:04:31,570 --> 02:04:32,230
Are you okay?

3277
02:04:32,970 --> 02:04:34,370
That was way too loud.

3278
02:04:35,790 --> 02:04:37,930
Why is the intermission so loud?

3279
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:38,570
Did you win yours?

3280
02:04:41,010 --> 02:04:41,910
Squid's a liar.

3281
02:04:42,270 --> 02:04:43,110
Squid's a liar.

3282
02:04:43,190 --> 02:04:43,650
Don't trust.

3283
02:04:44,270 --> 02:04:45,130
Mimi's a liar too.

3284
02:04:45,490 --> 02:04:45,770
Who?

3285
02:04:47,010 --> 02:04:47,490
Okay.

3286
02:04:50,470 --> 02:04:51,930
Pizza had to truth there.

3287
02:04:51,970 --> 02:04:52,810
We went 4-4.

3288
02:04:54,630 --> 02:04:58,070
I had the gut instinct that you were deceiving me, but you were.

3289
02:04:58,070 --> 02:04:58,870
I got lied too.

3290
02:04:59,310 --> 02:05:01,950
I got two points though.

3291
02:05:02,730 --> 02:05:03,210
Hey.

3292
02:05:04,330 --> 02:05:05,730
How much did Eerov get?

3293
02:05:05,790 --> 02:05:06,870
How much did Eerov get?

3294
02:05:07,870 --> 02:05:08,350
Eerov!

3295
02:05:09,270 --> 02:05:10,230
Wake up!

3296
02:05:11,110 --> 02:05:12,070
Wake up!

3297
02:05:13,850 --> 02:05:15,030
Did you win or lose?

3298
02:05:15,590 --> 02:05:16,070
Yes.

3299
02:05:16,170 --> 02:05:17,310
Good luck to us.

3300
02:05:17,750 --> 02:05:19,150
Who was it?

3301
02:05:19,190 --> 02:05:19,830
Who was it?

3302
02:05:20,250 --> 02:05:20,890
I got two.

3303
02:05:23,650 --> 02:05:24,410
Who was it?

3304
02:05:24,630 --> 02:05:26,190
Are you a liar?

3305
02:05:26,230 --> 02:05:27,830
You got me though, right?

3306
02:05:27,830 --> 02:05:28,610
You got me though, right?

3307
02:05:29,230 --> 02:05:30,150
I can't lie.

3308
02:05:30,210 --> 02:05:30,970
I have a problem.

3309
02:05:31,130 --> 02:05:31,750
I don't have any...

3310
02:05:31,750 --> 02:05:33,390
I can't do it.

3311
02:05:34,310 --> 02:05:34,750
Oh.

3312
02:05:38,850 --> 02:05:39,670
Well, well, well.

3313
02:05:39,910 --> 02:05:40,210
Hey.

3314
02:05:41,210 --> 02:05:43,570
So, I'mma just keep it $1.50 with you.

3315
02:05:43,770 --> 02:05:45,090
Two wins, two losses.

3316
02:05:45,330 --> 02:05:47,410
We traded wins and losses with my last person.

3317
02:05:47,530 --> 02:05:48,150
Oh, sweet.

3318
02:05:48,150 --> 02:05:48,490
Okay.

3319
02:05:49,130 --> 02:05:51,790
Anyway, don't trust Squid because he's a fucking liar.

3320
02:05:52,130 --> 02:05:52,250
Okay.

3321
02:05:52,290 --> 02:05:53,490
I'm thinking about you.

3322
02:05:53,550 --> 02:05:57,830
I don't know who Squid is, but I'm thinking about you and the person right in front of me here.

3323
02:05:57,950 --> 02:06:00,030
What item did you just get?

3324
02:06:00,230 --> 02:06:01,490
I got a blade.

3325
02:06:02,150 --> 02:06:03,470
I want to trust you.

3326
02:06:04,050 --> 02:06:04,750
Yeah, you should.

3327
02:06:04,830 --> 02:06:05,650
I'm very trustworthy.

3328
02:06:06,570 --> 02:06:10,230
But this first round is gonna decide how we're gonna do the rest of this game.

3329
02:06:10,330 --> 02:06:11,610
I'm willing to be trustworthy with you.

3330
02:06:11,730 --> 02:06:12,270
Okay, cool.

3331
02:06:12,610 --> 02:06:14,770
So, I'm gonna lock it in with 10 seconds left.

3332
02:06:14,990 --> 02:06:17,770
Okay, don't do it.

3333
02:06:17,870 --> 02:06:18,610
Don't do it.

3334
02:06:18,650 --> 02:06:19,730
I know you lost round one.

3335
02:06:20,250 --> 02:06:20,650
Yeah.

3336
02:06:21,050 --> 02:06:23,030
I didn't lie about it.

3337
02:06:23,290 --> 02:06:24,450
I didn't switch up on you.

3338
02:06:24,470 --> 02:06:25,010
Oh, wow.

3339
02:06:25,110 --> 02:06:26,110
You're actually being honest.

3340
02:06:26,170 --> 02:06:26,510
Yeah.

3341
02:06:29,090 --> 02:06:29,490
Now...

3342
02:06:30,390 --> 02:06:31,250
Okay, okay.

3343
02:06:31,390 --> 02:06:32,650
I need to be smart about this.

3344
02:06:34,090 --> 02:06:34,490
Yeah?

3345
02:06:34,910 --> 02:06:35,970
Are you gonna keep lying?

3346
02:06:36,770 --> 02:06:37,570
No, no.

3347
02:06:37,730 --> 02:06:38,610
How about this?

3348
02:06:38,810 --> 02:06:40,570
You know you're not gonna win the $70,000.

3349
02:06:41,490 --> 02:06:42,150
Who says?

3350
02:06:42,310 --> 02:06:44,410
You said something I don't like you.

3351
02:06:45,010 --> 02:06:45,410
Wow.

3352
02:06:46,210 --> 02:06:48,310
That's a loser's mentality right there.

3353
02:06:48,490 --> 02:06:49,590
And I'm a winner.

3354
02:06:49,690 --> 02:06:50,250
I'm gonna do it.

3355
02:06:50,610 --> 02:06:52,170
Wait, what item did I just get?

3356
02:06:52,250 --> 02:06:53,170
I think I missed it.

3357
02:06:53,310 --> 02:06:53,770
I don't know.

3358
02:06:55,090 --> 02:06:56,250
You've been assigned an item.

3359
02:06:56,390 --> 02:06:57,410
I can't see it.

3360
02:06:57,770 --> 02:06:58,550
Oh, there it is.

3361
02:06:59,130 --> 02:07:00,270
How did you see it?

3362
02:07:00,670 --> 02:07:01,670
You pressed F.

3363
02:07:01,850 --> 02:07:05,270
So, I got a knife.

3364
02:07:05,630 --> 02:07:06,070
Okay.

3365
02:07:07,990 --> 02:07:09,410
So, does that mean I get that round?

3366
02:07:10,490 --> 02:07:12,270
If you skull, you will win.

3367
02:07:12,810 --> 02:07:13,250
Alright.

3368
02:07:14,010 --> 02:07:15,510
I'm putting that skull in.

3369
02:07:16,510 --> 02:07:17,850
You wouldn't lie to me, right?

3370
02:07:18,630 --> 02:07:19,070
Nope.

3371
02:07:19,070 --> 02:07:20,510
I just met you, but...

3372
02:07:20,510 --> 02:07:22,670
We just met, but you wouldn't lie to me, right?

3373
02:07:22,670 --> 02:07:23,970
I'm literally a bear.

3374
02:07:24,310 --> 02:07:24,710
Oh!

3375
02:07:25,190 --> 02:07:26,270
Wait, you're a truther.

3376
02:07:26,990 --> 02:07:27,810
I'm a truther.

3377
02:07:27,970 --> 02:07:31,290
I told you, I went back and forth exactly like this with my last person.

3378
02:07:31,530 --> 02:07:31,590
Okay.

3379
02:07:31,730 --> 02:07:34,230
Because all you gotta do is not lose everything.

3380
02:07:34,530 --> 02:07:34,830
Yeah.

3381
02:07:34,830 --> 02:07:37,450
If you just win two and lose two, you'll be in the middle.

3382
02:07:37,470 --> 02:07:37,930
You'll be fine.

3383
02:07:38,050 --> 02:07:38,630
You get through.

3384
02:07:38,790 --> 02:07:39,130
Okay.

3385
02:07:39,530 --> 02:07:40,830
Alright, I have a skull.

3386
02:07:42,550 --> 02:07:43,610
Deadass, you have a skull?

3387
02:07:43,770 --> 02:07:43,950
Yeah.

3388
02:07:45,210 --> 02:07:46,830
What's something you really care about in life?

3389
02:07:47,990 --> 02:07:49,390
I care about...

3390
02:07:49,390 --> 02:07:50,530
Do you have animals?

3391
02:07:51,090 --> 02:07:51,550
Whoa!

3392
02:07:52,070 --> 02:07:53,370
What are you do to my animal?

3393
02:07:53,890 --> 02:07:55,090
No, what I'm saying is...

3394
02:07:55,090 --> 02:07:56,610
I want you to put that promise.

3395
02:07:56,870 --> 02:07:58,870
If you're gonna promise...

3396
02:07:58,870 --> 02:08:02,050
Alright, if it's not a skull, I'll let you kill my pet.

3397
02:08:02,770 --> 02:08:03,410
In game.

3398
02:08:04,310 --> 02:08:05,150
In Minecraft.

3399
02:08:05,970 --> 02:08:06,970
Okay, I'm just gonna...

3400
02:08:06,970 --> 02:08:08,090
It's a skull!

3401
02:08:08,890 --> 02:08:09,350
Yeah!

3402
02:08:11,590 --> 02:08:12,050
See?

3403
02:08:12,910 --> 02:08:14,690
Oh wait, the timer's not up.

3404
02:08:16,030 --> 02:08:16,610
Wait, what?

3405
02:08:16,610 --> 02:08:18,630
I thought the timer...

3406
02:08:18,630 --> 02:08:20,110
You have to wait until it's zero.

3407
02:08:20,590 --> 02:08:21,190
Mm-mm.

3408
02:08:21,610 --> 02:08:23,610
I would never lie to you.

3409
02:08:23,770 --> 02:08:24,150
I'm trusting you.

3410
02:08:24,490 --> 02:08:24,950
Nice.

3411
02:08:25,070 --> 02:08:27,530
And now my turn.

3412
02:08:32,020 --> 02:08:32,480
Uh...

3413
02:08:32,480 --> 02:08:33,660
Wait, whose turn is it?

3414
02:08:33,800 --> 02:08:34,360
It's my turn.

3415
02:08:34,580 --> 02:08:35,140
What do you have?

3416
02:08:35,560 --> 02:08:36,800
Dude, this is crazy.

3417
02:08:37,380 --> 02:08:39,820
Because I've been getting knife every single round.

3418
02:08:41,240 --> 02:08:42,480
I got a knife again.

3419
02:08:42,780 --> 02:08:43,180
Okay.

3420
02:08:43,400 --> 02:08:44,680
So I can put this then.

3421
02:08:46,080 --> 02:08:46,780
How much?

3422
02:08:46,900 --> 02:08:47,160
Alright.

3423
02:08:48,500 --> 02:08:50,160
What do you love in life?

3424
02:08:50,940 --> 02:08:51,960
I love my mother.

3425
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:53,640
Okay, well...

3426
02:08:54,420 --> 02:08:56,160
I'm gonna build a statue of your mom.

3427
02:08:56,700 --> 02:08:57,500
In Minecraft.

3428
02:08:57,740 --> 02:08:58,800
If you lie to me.

3429
02:08:59,360 --> 02:09:00,700
And I'll blow it up.

3430
02:09:02,700 --> 02:09:03,140
Doki.

3431
02:09:04,240 --> 02:09:06,540
I love my mom, so I'm gonna change my mind.

3432
02:09:07,460 --> 02:09:08,280
I have a scroll.

3433
02:09:08,280 --> 02:09:09,300
I said if you lie to me.

3434
02:09:09,460 --> 02:09:10,160
Oh, alright.

3435
02:09:10,680 --> 02:09:11,120
I know.

3436
02:09:11,120 --> 02:09:12,220
I love my mom too much.

3437
02:09:12,240 --> 02:09:12,900
It's wrong, bro.

3438
02:09:13,020 --> 02:09:13,640
It's just wrong.

3439
02:09:13,660 --> 02:09:15,580
Yeah, I will post that video up too.

3440
02:09:16,100 --> 02:09:16,900
On YouTube.

3441
02:09:18,460 --> 02:09:19,260
My channel subscriber.

3442
02:09:19,840 --> 02:09:22,040
And see how many people are gonna watch it.

3443
02:09:25,120 --> 02:09:26,080
It's a draw.

3444
02:09:26,620 --> 02:09:27,100
Okay.

3445
02:09:30,100 --> 02:09:31,220
So you did lie.

3446
02:09:32,220 --> 02:09:33,400
You did lie.

3447
02:09:34,260 --> 02:09:35,660
It was a pleasure.

3448
02:09:36,620 --> 02:09:37,100
Yay!

3449
02:09:38,320 --> 02:09:39,580
Charlie, what point did you get?

3450
02:09:40,560 --> 02:09:42,160
I'm at 11.

3451
02:09:42,960 --> 02:09:43,700
Oh, that's good.

3452
02:09:43,820 --> 02:09:44,240
I got...

3453
02:09:44,240 --> 02:09:47,780
I got 5 points.

3454
02:09:48,460 --> 02:09:48,660
Okay.

3455
02:09:48,840 --> 02:09:51,200
Did you vote?

3456
02:09:52,720 --> 02:09:53,200
Sleepy.

3457
02:09:53,200 --> 02:09:54,520
I have 5 points.

3458
02:09:54,560 --> 02:09:55,700
How many points do you have?

3459
02:09:55,800 --> 02:09:56,220
I have 6.

3460
02:09:56,540 --> 02:09:58,980
Who are you playing against?

3461
02:09:59,480 --> 02:10:01,120
I wanna get some Btmc.

3462
02:10:01,200 --> 02:10:02,180
Let's go, Eero!

3463
02:10:03,980 --> 02:10:06,740
Oh, this is scary.

3464
02:10:07,020 --> 02:10:07,680
Sleepy, sleepy, sleepy.

3465
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:08,700
It's on the top left.

3466
02:10:08,980 --> 02:10:11,460
I got 6.

3467
02:10:13,040 --> 02:10:13,900
Btmc is cool.

3468
02:10:15,580 --> 02:10:16,660
Btmc is not cool.

3469
02:10:16,660 --> 02:10:17,940
It's on the top left.

3470
02:10:18,200 --> 02:10:19,240
It's not cool.

3471
02:10:19,240 --> 02:10:21,160
He's not cool with you, Abe.

3472
02:10:22,820 --> 02:10:24,740
You're not cool with anyone, man.

3473
02:10:24,760 --> 02:10:25,900
Btmc is not cool.

3474
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:26,960
Wait, what do you mean?

3475
02:10:27,740 --> 02:10:30,180
I've been the truth player this entire time.

3476
02:10:31,140 --> 02:10:31,860
I'm nervous.

3477
02:10:32,260 --> 02:10:33,600
Btmc is more like Dookie.

3478
02:10:35,180 --> 02:10:36,140
Me, personally?

3479
02:10:36,920 --> 02:10:37,400
No.

3480
02:10:38,860 --> 02:10:39,340
Damn.

3481
02:10:39,880 --> 02:10:41,320
I knew I should punch you out.

3482
02:10:41,380 --> 02:10:44,660
I got 6.

3483
02:10:45,300 --> 02:10:45,600
I got 6.

3484
02:10:46,660 --> 02:10:47,600
I got 5.

3485
02:10:47,780 --> 02:10:49,440
You guys are ass.

3486
02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:50,540
I got 24 points.

3487
02:10:51,380 --> 02:10:52,680
Dookie, you have 5 points?

3488
02:10:53,040 --> 02:10:54,480
Yeah, 5 points.

3489
02:10:55,500 --> 02:10:56,860
How many points do you have?

3490
02:10:57,460 --> 02:10:58,540
I have 10 points.

3491
02:10:58,720 --> 02:10:59,380
What the fuck?

3492
02:10:59,980 --> 02:11:01,740
You've been lying to people.

3493
02:11:02,140 --> 02:11:03,500
You're a liar.

3494
02:11:04,100 --> 02:11:05,300
This is a liar.

3495
02:11:06,280 --> 02:11:07,900
You should be proud of that.

3496
02:11:07,960 --> 02:11:10,900
Yeah, you should not be proud of having 10 points because you're a liar.

3497
02:11:11,360 --> 02:11:12,620
I literally have not lied once.

3498
02:11:13,820 --> 02:11:15,020
He's lying to us right now.

3499
02:11:15,080 --> 02:11:16,160
Yeah, he's lying to us.

3500
02:11:16,660 --> 02:11:17,920
He's not a good person because he's a liar.

3501
02:11:18,260 --> 02:11:19,240
Is it true, Abe?

3502
02:11:19,240 --> 02:11:20,820
People just don't trust you so you have 10 points?

3503
02:11:21,180 --> 02:11:22,300
Yeah, I have 10 points.

3504
02:11:22,360 --> 02:11:23,100
I haven't lied once.

3505
02:11:23,880 --> 02:11:25,820
Everyone just trusts me.

3506
02:11:26,740 --> 02:11:27,420
Dude, no.

3507
02:11:27,420 --> 02:11:28,580
I have the inverse effect.

3508
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:30,020
No one fucking trusts me.

3509
02:11:30,140 --> 02:11:31,980
Well, that's for a good reason, man.

3510
02:11:32,340 --> 02:11:33,660
I wouldn't trust you either.

3511
02:11:33,960 --> 02:11:36,640
Oh shit.

3512
02:11:36,680 --> 02:11:37,000
Hello there.

3513
02:11:38,180 --> 02:11:40,320
Are you a truther?

3514
02:11:41,180 --> 02:11:42,580
I am a truther, actually.

3515
02:11:42,780 --> 02:11:45,900
I'm a firm believer that what we should do is round 1.

3516
02:11:46,660 --> 02:11:47,620
I'll show you what I have, genuinely.

3517
02:11:48,120 --> 02:11:50,380
And you can win one and then you do the same.

3518
02:11:50,580 --> 02:11:51,500
And I get to win one.

3519
02:11:51,580 --> 02:11:53,740
So the first two rounds, we don't play for real.

3520
02:11:53,860 --> 02:11:55,300
And then the second two rounds, we'll play for real.

3521
02:11:55,320 --> 02:11:56,360
Sure, that'll be fun.

3522
02:11:57,060 --> 02:11:57,560
Okay, yeah.

3523
02:11:57,620 --> 02:11:58,800
So I have skull this time.

3524
02:11:58,940 --> 02:12:00,160
So you should do the scroll.

3525
02:12:00,440 --> 02:12:01,500
Yeah, like this?

3526
02:12:02,340 --> 02:12:02,980
Yeah, perfect.

3527
02:12:03,440 --> 02:12:05,420
And you wouldn't lie to me too, right?

3528
02:12:05,860 --> 02:12:06,940
No, I'm not lying.

3529
02:12:07,960 --> 02:12:10,940
You'll be willing to do it because you're going to know that I was truthing this whole time.

3530
02:12:11,220 --> 02:12:13,160
Because I do have skull, 100%.

3531
02:12:13,160 --> 02:12:15,020
Oh yeah, skull, okay.

3532
02:12:15,420 --> 02:12:16,800
I trust you.

3533
02:12:18,060 --> 02:12:20,020
You seem like you're a Minecraft player.

3534
02:12:20,440 --> 02:12:21,780
I'm doing a lot of faith here.

3535
02:12:21,860 --> 02:12:23,020
I'm trusting you preemptively.

3536
02:12:23,620 --> 02:12:25,120
Oh hey, you're right!

3537
02:12:25,640 --> 02:12:26,460
What did I say?

3538
02:12:26,620 --> 02:12:27,680
I told you I was a truther.

3539
02:12:27,940 --> 02:12:28,900
Yeah, you're such a truther.

3540
02:12:28,920 --> 02:12:30,640
Okay, I'll tell you what I have too.

3541
02:12:31,860 --> 02:12:32,300
Okay.

3542
02:12:33,280 --> 02:12:36,220
I knew trusting Minecraft players was the right idea.

3543
02:12:36,700 --> 02:12:37,660
That's what I'm saying.

3544
02:12:37,940 --> 02:12:38,820
I have a scroll.

3545
02:12:39,700 --> 02:12:40,440
Okay, the scroll.

3546
02:12:40,540 --> 02:12:41,380
Okay, so I should go knife.

3547
02:12:41,740 --> 02:12:42,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3548
02:12:43,020 --> 02:12:44,220
I would never lie to you.

3549
02:12:44,860 --> 02:12:46,460
After we established our bonds.

3550
02:12:47,220 --> 02:12:49,260
Yeah, after I gave you that first one.

3551
02:12:49,400 --> 02:12:52,320
Like we just met, you don't know my character.

3552
02:12:53,400 --> 02:12:53,760
Yeah.

3553
02:12:53,920 --> 02:12:55,100
Yeah, but I would never lie.

3554
02:12:55,360 --> 02:12:58,340
You gave me two points, so why would I want another two points?

3555
02:12:59,520 --> 02:12:59,880
Yeah.

3556
02:13:00,020 --> 02:13:02,060
Why would you not want to also give me two points?

3557
02:13:02,060 --> 02:13:02,640
Yeah, exactly.

3558
02:13:03,520 --> 02:13:04,220
That's kind of fair.

3559
02:13:05,120 --> 02:13:06,460
Yeah, that would be so fucked up.

3560
02:13:08,820 --> 02:13:09,820
Yeah, and then we played for real.

3561
02:13:09,940 --> 02:13:14,240
I mean, it would be so fucked up if I just like yoinked two points off of you like that.

3562
02:13:14,720 --> 02:13:15,840
After you gave me...

3563
02:13:16,240 --> 02:13:18,300
After I gave you that free two points.

3564
02:13:18,380 --> 02:13:20,880
Like, what kind of person am I to do that to you?

3565
02:13:21,320 --> 02:13:22,160
I would be...

3566
02:13:22,160 --> 02:13:23,740
I would be heartbroken if that happened.

3567
02:13:24,120 --> 02:13:26,340
See, look, see, I told you.

3568
02:13:26,900 --> 02:13:28,900
I told you I was truthing.

3569
02:13:29,320 --> 02:13:31,160
I would never fuck with you like that.

3570
02:13:31,800 --> 02:13:32,740
That's what I like to hear.

3571
02:13:33,420 --> 02:13:34,740
Okay, we're playing for real now?

3572
02:13:34,940 --> 02:13:35,340
Yeah, sure.

3573
02:13:36,340 --> 02:13:36,740
Okay.

3574
02:13:38,820 --> 02:13:39,940
Do you want me to tell you what I got still?

3575
02:13:40,240 --> 02:13:40,560
Sure.

3576
02:13:41,560 --> 02:13:43,720
Okay, I did in fact get the paper.

3577
02:13:44,120 --> 02:13:45,260
Oh, you got paper again?

3578
02:13:45,960 --> 02:13:46,620
I did.

3579
02:13:47,220 --> 02:13:47,620
Damn.

3580
02:13:47,700 --> 02:13:50,480
I've actually had paper the last three times now.

3581
02:13:50,780 --> 02:13:52,300
You had paper the last three times?

3582
02:13:52,360 --> 02:13:53,460
Wait, how many points do you have?

3583
02:13:53,500 --> 02:13:54,700
Yeah, because I had paper round one with you, right?

3584
02:13:54,820 --> 02:13:58,640
Yeah, I had paper my last round against the other person as well.

3585
02:13:58,920 --> 02:14:00,220
Yeah, wait, how many rounds...

3586
02:14:00,220 --> 02:14:01,320
How many points do you have?

3587
02:14:02,020 --> 02:14:03,140
Oh, I'm at nine right now.

3588
02:14:03,140 --> 02:14:04,360
You have nine points?

3589
02:14:04,620 --> 02:14:05,020
Damn.

3590
02:14:05,140 --> 02:14:05,680
Yeah, how many do you have?

3591
02:14:05,760 --> 02:14:07,580
Wait, that means people have been lying to you.

3592
02:14:08,680 --> 02:14:10,280
Yeah, people have been lying to me a bit.

3593
02:14:10,320 --> 02:14:11,200
That's so fucked up.

3594
02:14:11,260 --> 02:14:12,640
Why would they lie to you like that?

3595
02:14:13,120 --> 02:14:14,980
Well, you know, people be lying.

3596
02:14:15,220 --> 02:14:17,640
Yeah, you should get them banned for lying.

3597
02:14:18,160 --> 02:14:18,840
Get them banned?

3598
02:14:19,040 --> 02:14:19,420
Yeah.

3599
02:14:22,120 --> 02:14:22,920
They're liars.

3600
02:14:22,920 --> 02:14:24,020
Yeah, liars.

3601
02:14:24,060 --> 02:14:24,800
Oh, hey.

3602
02:14:25,360 --> 02:14:26,140
Wait, you lied.

3603
02:14:27,500 --> 02:14:28,300
I was close.

3604
02:14:28,800 --> 02:14:29,640
I was close.

3605
02:14:29,840 --> 02:14:30,800
I wasn't even ready.

3606
02:14:30,800 --> 02:14:31,580
Please, please.

3607
02:14:32,940 --> 02:14:33,260
Okay.

3608
02:14:33,680 --> 02:14:35,000
Wait, so how many points do you have?

3609
02:14:35,160 --> 02:14:35,760
I have seven.

3610
02:14:36,520 --> 02:14:37,260
Oh, you have seven.

3611
02:14:37,320 --> 02:14:39,060
Okay, see, I'm at a comfortable ten right now.

3612
02:14:39,240 --> 02:14:39,640
Yeah, yeah.

3613
02:14:40,320 --> 02:14:43,240
Okay, well, what did you get so I can give you these two points?

3614
02:14:43,360 --> 02:14:44,280
I have a...

3615
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:45,800
I have a knife.

3616
02:14:46,640 --> 02:14:47,400
You have a knife?

3617
02:14:47,540 --> 02:14:47,920
Oh, okay.

3618
02:14:50,460 --> 02:14:50,780
Yeah.

3619
02:14:50,800 --> 02:14:50,900
Yeah.

3620
02:14:52,340 --> 02:14:52,660
Okay.

3621
02:14:53,620 --> 02:14:55,560
Wait, I thought you were going to give me those two points.

3622
02:14:55,640 --> 02:14:56,200
What happened?

3623
02:14:57,720 --> 02:14:58,040
Uh...

3624
02:14:58,560 --> 02:14:59,200
I mean...

3625
02:15:00,800 --> 02:15:02,440
I thought we were playing for real the last two rounds.

3626
02:15:02,520 --> 02:15:04,320
Yeah, but then you're going to lie to me?

3627
02:15:05,280 --> 02:15:05,720
Oh...

3628
02:15:06,700 --> 02:15:09,080
Oh... What's the thing that you love the most in life?

3629
02:15:10,620 --> 02:15:11,060
Um...

3630
02:15:12,160 --> 02:15:12,940
I don't know.

3631
02:15:13,660 --> 02:15:14,440
What's the thing?

3632
02:15:14,480 --> 02:15:15,060
Living, I guess.

3633
02:15:15,280 --> 02:15:16,900
Life is funny, you know?

3634
02:15:16,940 --> 02:15:17,720
Life is funny?

3635
02:15:18,500 --> 02:15:20,220
Yeah, it's a funny thing, you know?

3636
02:15:20,260 --> 02:15:22,340
Well, I hope you're happy living in hell.

3637
02:15:23,080 --> 02:15:23,520
Oh!

3638
02:15:24,400 --> 02:15:24,840
Oh!

3639
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:25,680
Oh, no!

3640
02:15:29,040 --> 02:15:31,600
I hope you live with that guilt for the rest of your life.

3641
02:15:31,800 --> 02:15:33,580
I thought you were lying, so then I...

3642
02:15:33,580 --> 02:15:33,720
...

3643
02:15:34,840 --> 02:15:35,240
...

3644
02:15:37,280 --> 02:15:37,680
...

3645
02:15:38,640 --> 02:15:39,040
...

3646
02:15:44,020 --> 02:15:47,480
I have seven points.

3647
02:15:48,200 --> 02:15:49,380
I have ten points.

3648
02:15:50,500 --> 02:15:51,560
I'm stressed out.

3649
02:15:51,620 --> 02:15:53,500
I need to start lying.

3650
02:15:53,800 --> 02:15:54,660
Dude, you're on a roll, man.

3651
02:15:55,560 --> 02:15:56,740
I got lied to again.

3652
02:15:56,880 --> 02:15:57,440
I got lied to.

3653
02:15:57,440 --> 02:15:57,960
I got lied to again.

3654
02:15:58,120 --> 02:16:00,940
I got lied to again.

3655
02:16:00,940 --> 02:16:04,020
I need to start lying.

3656
02:16:04,080 --> 02:16:08,280
I need to start lying.

3657
02:16:08,360 --> 02:16:08,720
I need to start lying.

3658
02:16:08,720 --> 02:16:09,440
I need to start lying.

3659
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,300
Why the fuck have you been telling the truth?

3660
02:16:12,300 --> 02:16:12,320
Why the fuck have you been telling the truth?

3661
02:16:12,520 --> 02:16:14,600
Because I always been telling the...

3662
02:16:14,600 --> 02:16:15,940
Because I don't tell lies!

3663
02:16:16,520 --> 02:16:17,720
That's not true!

3664
02:16:17,800 --> 02:16:19,080
I don't tell lies!

3665
02:16:19,820 --> 02:16:22,380
You literally lie to me 24-7.

3666
02:16:22,420 --> 02:16:23,700
That's not true!

3667
02:16:23,700 --> 02:16:24,420
That's not true!

3668
02:16:25,420 --> 02:16:26,580
That's not true!

3669
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:28,820
I'm always a true thing!

3670
02:16:31,580 --> 02:16:32,960
Yeah, me neither, man.

3671
02:16:33,720 --> 02:16:35,440
Wait, how many more games do we have left?

3672
02:16:36,480 --> 02:16:37,200
Two more, I think.

3673
02:16:37,580 --> 02:16:38,020
Two?

3674
02:16:38,200 --> 02:16:38,640
Two?

3675
02:16:38,860 --> 02:16:39,120
Okay.

3676
02:16:40,340 --> 02:16:41,560
Wait, how many do you have, Doki?

3677
02:16:42,880 --> 02:16:43,760
Six, I think.

3678
02:16:44,040 --> 02:16:45,500
Don't, don't, don't trust...

3679
02:16:45,500 --> 02:16:45,980
How many do you have?

3680
02:16:46,700 --> 02:16:47,360
I got eight.

3681
02:16:47,680 --> 02:16:48,920
I got lied to.

3682
02:16:49,020 --> 02:16:49,980
I got lied to by Iskall.

3683
02:16:50,120 --> 02:16:50,860
And he's Swedish.

3684
02:16:52,020 --> 02:16:52,380
Wait!

3685
02:16:52,800 --> 02:16:54,280
Maybe he's a fake Swede.

3686
02:16:55,100 --> 02:16:55,460
Yeah.

3687
02:16:56,720 --> 02:16:58,600
It was going well and then he lied to me.

3688
02:16:59,000 --> 02:16:59,800
That's fucked up.

3689
02:16:59,860 --> 02:17:00,720
Why don't you lie too?

3690
02:17:03,260 --> 02:17:04,980
I might have to head to my lying arc.

3691
02:17:05,600 --> 02:17:06,700
You have to start lying.

3692
02:17:06,740 --> 02:17:07,860
I gotta start lying too.

3693
02:17:10,240 --> 02:17:10,840
Wait, Kumi.

3694
02:17:10,900 --> 02:17:11,940
If we get matched up...

3695
02:17:11,940 --> 02:17:13,580
We have known each other for so long.

3696
02:17:13,660 --> 02:17:14,460
You wouldn't lie to me, right?

3697
02:17:14,500 --> 02:17:15,700
Yeah, I would never lie to you.

3698
02:17:16,020 --> 02:17:16,500
Of course.

3699
02:17:16,580 --> 02:17:17,280
What if you're lying right now?

3700
02:17:18,040 --> 02:17:20,200
I've been tricked because I've been telling the truth!

3701
02:17:20,860 --> 02:17:21,860
That's why seven points!

3702
02:17:22,260 --> 02:17:22,880
You wouldn't lie to me, right?

3703
02:17:23,100 --> 02:17:27,360
No, it's because we were trading and he told me he had Skull.

3704
02:17:27,480 --> 02:17:29,340
And I said, okay, I like you.

3705
02:17:29,380 --> 02:17:30,260
I'm gonna give you the win.

3706
02:17:30,360 --> 02:17:31,140
And I picked Blade.

3707
02:17:31,360 --> 02:17:32,840
And then he goes, no, it'll be a tie.

3708
02:17:36,220 --> 02:17:36,620
Hey!

3709
02:17:38,100 --> 02:17:39,040
Are you a liar?

3710
02:17:39,140 --> 02:17:42,460
No, I've been having a rough time because everybody's lying to me.

3711
02:17:42,940 --> 02:17:43,880
I'm not a liar.

3712
02:17:44,060 --> 02:17:44,460
Are you sure?

3713
02:17:44,740 --> 02:17:45,940
Are you sure?

3714
02:17:47,540 --> 02:17:50,320
I'm gonna tell you now that I got a knife.

3715
02:17:50,780 --> 02:17:51,220
Okay.

3716
02:17:52,460 --> 02:17:53,640
I'll put a skull up.

3717
02:17:53,780 --> 02:17:55,620
I'll be honest, I'm not lying.

3718
02:17:55,860 --> 02:17:56,660
Are you sure?

3719
02:17:56,740 --> 02:17:57,520
If you lie to me, I'll be upset.

3720
02:17:58,060 --> 02:17:59,960
Wait, how many points do you have?

3721
02:18:00,820 --> 02:18:01,560
I got eight.

3722
02:18:01,820 --> 02:18:02,440
You got eight?

3723
02:18:03,340 --> 02:18:06,420
Yeah, because I haven't been lying, but I had two people lying and then I got a draw.

3724
02:18:06,460 --> 02:18:08,120
Yeah, I haven't been lying.

3725
02:18:08,220 --> 02:18:11,420
I have three points because they all took advantage of my truth.

3726
02:18:11,700 --> 02:18:11,940
What?

3727
02:18:13,540 --> 02:18:15,720
Everybody's been taking advantage of me.

3728
02:18:16,640 --> 02:18:19,960
Don't worry, I won't be lying to you.

3729
02:18:20,680 --> 02:18:23,380
I don't lie at all either, but I think that's kind of...

3730
02:18:23,380 --> 02:18:23,900
I don't lie at all either, but I think that's kind of...

3731
02:18:23,900 --> 02:18:24,840
Oh my god, thank you!

3732
02:18:25,200 --> 02:18:26,640
Now I have five points!

3733
02:18:26,920 --> 02:18:29,060
Thank you, that's so sweet of you!

3734
02:18:30,740 --> 02:18:32,740
I got you, don't worry, I won't lie to you.

3735
02:18:32,800 --> 02:18:33,360
Oh my god, okay.

3736
02:18:34,340 --> 02:18:35,700
Can I have another point?

3737
02:18:35,860 --> 02:18:37,300
So I can stay in the game?

3738
02:18:37,540 --> 02:18:39,360
And then I'll give you the next two points?

3739
02:18:41,080 --> 02:18:41,480
Okay.

3740
02:18:41,980 --> 02:18:42,380
Yay!

3741
02:18:43,280 --> 02:18:44,080
Um, paper.

3742
02:18:46,820 --> 02:18:48,380
Oh, then I need to do skull.

3743
02:18:48,840 --> 02:18:49,240
Yeah.

3744
02:18:49,960 --> 02:18:50,280
Thank you!

3745
02:18:51,340 --> 02:18:54,080
I almost did paper again and gave it a draw, but...

3746
02:18:55,040 --> 02:18:55,920
That's so sweet.

3747
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:57,720
I'll give you the points for the next one.

3748
02:18:58,100 --> 02:18:58,920
And then we should...

3749
02:18:58,920 --> 02:19:00,260
I would never!

3750
02:19:00,940 --> 02:19:01,940
No, I didn't!

3751
02:19:03,900 --> 02:19:04,960
I think I have paper.

3752
02:19:05,200 --> 02:19:06,320
Wait, let me double check again.

3753
02:19:06,560 --> 02:19:07,440
Yeah, I have paper.

3754
02:19:08,240 --> 02:19:09,520
I'm very forgetful too.

3755
02:19:10,320 --> 02:19:11,420
No, no, I would never.

3756
02:19:12,360 --> 02:19:13,680
I would never lie to you.

3757
02:19:14,820 --> 02:19:17,000
No, that's why I have three points!

3758
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,780
Because people took advantage of my kindness.

3759
02:19:20,760 --> 02:19:24,000
I thought I had an alliance and then they abused it.

3760
02:19:24,960 --> 02:19:25,400
I thought I had an alliance and then they abused it.

3761
02:19:28,400 --> 02:19:28,840
Okay.

3762
02:19:28,980 --> 02:19:29,900
I mean like this round.

3763
02:19:30,120 --> 02:19:31,380
Oh yeah, yeah, this round, this round.

3764
02:19:32,320 --> 02:19:33,560
What do you have?

3765
02:19:34,020 --> 02:19:34,960
I got a skull.

3766
02:19:35,400 --> 02:19:35,980
Look, see?

3767
02:19:36,700 --> 02:19:37,860
I never lied to you.

3768
02:19:37,900 --> 02:19:38,780
You gave me four points.

3769
02:19:39,960 --> 02:19:40,660
Oh, it did?

3770
02:19:40,860 --> 02:19:41,300
Nice!

3771
02:19:41,480 --> 02:19:41,920
Yeah!

3772
02:19:41,920 --> 02:19:43,700
I was trying to tell people earlier.

3773
02:19:43,780 --> 02:19:45,940
I was like, you get more points if we just do that back and forth.

3774
02:19:45,940 --> 02:19:47,020
Work together, I know!

3775
02:19:47,340 --> 02:19:49,920
Like, I don't understand why people don't work together.

3776
02:19:51,300 --> 02:19:52,660
Like, it's so messed up.

3777
02:19:52,700 --> 02:19:53,260
It's Minecraft.

3778
02:19:53,440 --> 02:19:55,740
I thought Minecraft was all about like, working.

3779
02:19:55,860 --> 02:19:58,020
Like, we're not even allowed to swear in Minecraft.

3780
02:19:58,100 --> 02:19:59,100
And people are lying?

3781
02:20:00,660 --> 02:20:01,640
Yeah, what do they think?

3782
02:20:01,680 --> 02:20:02,420
This is Among Us?

3783
02:20:02,600 --> 02:20:04,720
Yeah, this is a Christian server.

3784
02:20:07,660 --> 02:20:09,640
God will not like this.

3785
02:20:10,260 --> 02:20:11,620
God will not like this.

3786
02:20:12,820 --> 02:20:14,280
The next one, do you wanna...

3787
02:20:14,280 --> 02:20:15,760
Would you rather just do like...

3788
02:20:16,520 --> 02:20:18,640
Like a wrong one rather than a plus four?

3789
02:20:19,320 --> 02:20:20,920
Yeah, we could just do like...

3790
02:20:20,920 --> 02:20:21,900
Wait, what do you mean by that?

3791
02:20:22,640 --> 02:20:23,580
You said plus...

3792
02:20:23,580 --> 02:20:25,000
Oh, no, no, no, this is plus two.

3793
02:20:25,100 --> 02:20:25,640
Okay, never mind.

3794
02:20:25,760 --> 02:20:27,640
I think I misunderstood the point system.

3795
02:20:27,960 --> 02:20:28,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3796
02:20:30,040 --> 02:20:30,620
Shut up.

3797
02:20:30,680 --> 02:20:31,400
Wait, is that the...

3798
02:20:31,880 --> 02:20:33,180
That's the last round, right?

3799
02:20:34,300 --> 02:20:34,700
Yes.

3800
02:20:34,920 --> 02:20:38,380
Oh, can I have two more points so I can not get eliminated?

3801
02:20:39,540 --> 02:20:39,940
Yeah.

3802
02:20:42,100 --> 02:20:42,920
What do you want?

3803
02:20:44,420 --> 02:20:45,360
I am...

3804
02:20:45,840 --> 02:20:46,100
Blade.

3805
02:20:51,030 --> 02:20:51,550
Yay!

3806
02:20:52,090 --> 02:20:53,390
You're so nice.

3807
02:20:53,590 --> 02:20:54,130
Oh my god.

3808
02:20:54,170 --> 02:20:57,230
You have been the nicest person I've like bumped into.

3809
02:20:57,590 --> 02:20:58,070
I told you, I won't lie to you.

3810
02:20:58,190 --> 02:20:59,050
That's so sweet!

3811
02:20:59,390 --> 02:21:02,110
I can't believe other people were taking advantage of your kindness.

3812
02:21:03,230 --> 02:21:04,210
I know, right?

3813
02:21:04,310 --> 02:21:05,430
That's so messed up.

3814
02:21:05,650 --> 02:21:07,330
I bet those people...

3815
02:21:07,330 --> 02:21:08,130
You're gonna go to hell.

3816
02:21:10,330 --> 02:21:11,530
Especially on Minecraft.

3817
02:21:11,890 --> 02:21:14,710
I know, especially on this Christian Minecraft server.

3818
02:21:14,730 --> 02:21:18,370
You know they're never gonna win that $70,000.

3819
02:21:18,850 --> 02:21:19,610
You know?

3820
02:21:20,750 --> 02:21:22,530
You're taking it so seriously.

3821
02:21:22,910 --> 02:21:23,230
I need that.

3822
02:21:24,990 --> 02:21:26,550
Oh my god, thank you!

3823
02:21:27,870 --> 02:21:29,390
Is that the last one?

3824
02:21:29,570 --> 02:21:30,610
Or do we have another one?

3825
02:21:30,790 --> 02:21:32,410
No, that was definitely the last one.

3826
02:21:32,970 --> 02:21:33,490
Yay!

3827
02:21:33,950 --> 02:21:35,050
That's so easy.

3828
02:21:37,350 --> 02:21:40,730
Guys, I got 13 points!

3829
02:21:41,370 --> 02:21:41,890
Wow!

3830
02:21:41,890 --> 02:21:42,130
I got 12!

3831
02:21:42,590 --> 02:21:43,490
I got 13!

3832
02:21:44,730 --> 02:21:45,570
Mendo, how many you got?

3833
02:21:46,310 --> 02:21:47,270
I'm chillin', bro.

3834
02:21:48,910 --> 02:21:50,690
Mendo, bro, you gotta step it up.

3835
02:21:50,890 --> 02:21:52,590
Dude, I can't lie.

3836
02:21:52,750 --> 02:21:53,890
They'll feel bad if I lie.

3837
02:21:54,390 --> 02:21:55,250
You gotta step it up.

3838
02:21:55,270 --> 02:21:56,350
You have to like take it.

3839
02:21:57,750 --> 02:21:58,550
I can't!

3840
02:21:58,730 --> 02:22:01,910
Oh my god, this is my new track, guilt tripping.

3841
02:22:03,350 --> 02:22:04,090
Who said that?

3842
02:22:04,310 --> 02:22:04,870
Who said that?

3843
02:22:06,810 --> 02:22:07,950
My new trick.

3844
02:22:08,310 --> 02:22:09,530
Mendo, I can't lie either, bro.

3845
02:22:09,530 --> 02:22:10,190
I can't do it.

3846
02:22:12,010 --> 02:22:13,130
What's your point, Abe?

3847
02:22:13,330 --> 02:22:14,190
They're all too nice.

3848
02:22:16,050 --> 02:22:17,310
What's your point?

3849
02:22:17,330 --> 02:22:18,330
What points do you have?

3850
02:22:18,550 --> 02:22:19,930
I can't take that away from you, man.

3851
02:22:21,590 --> 02:22:23,670
You have 19?

3852
02:22:27,070 --> 02:22:29,730
Oh my god, I can't even hear you.

3853
02:22:29,790 --> 02:22:30,550
You're so loud.

3854
02:22:33,850 --> 02:22:36,130
I can't believe it, guys.

3855
02:22:36,170 --> 02:22:37,310
I can't believe it.

3856
02:22:38,310 --> 02:22:39,510
I got 13 points.

3857
02:22:39,530 --> 02:22:41,770
Guys, I might be safe.

3858
02:22:42,850 --> 02:22:43,290
Maybe...

3859
02:22:43,290 --> 02:22:44,490
Wait, is this the last game?

3860
02:22:45,470 --> 02:22:47,730
Yeah, I think it's one round left.

3861
02:22:49,130 --> 02:22:49,570
Oh...

3862
02:22:49,570 --> 02:22:50,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3863
02:22:51,450 --> 02:22:54,010
Wait, how many points do you have?

3864
02:22:54,210 --> 02:22:55,170
That guy has 20!

3865
02:22:56,210 --> 02:22:57,230
14, I have 13.

3866
02:22:57,610 --> 02:22:58,950
I think we could be eliminated.

3867
02:22:59,590 --> 02:23:00,790
I think we might...

3868
02:23:00,790 --> 02:23:01,590
I think we're...

3869
02:23:02,510 --> 02:23:03,510
I think we're fucked.

3870
02:23:03,770 --> 02:23:06,370
No, no, no, surely not.

3871
02:23:06,690 --> 02:23:07,670
I think we're fucked.

3872
02:23:08,250 --> 02:23:09,510
That's not a lot of points.

3873
02:23:09,530 --> 02:23:10,930
13's not a lot.

3874
02:23:14,530 --> 02:23:14,970
14!

3875
02:23:15,990 --> 02:23:16,890
Oh, no.

3876
02:23:17,630 --> 02:23:18,630
Guys, I'm scared.

3877
02:23:19,330 --> 02:23:23,530
I got taken advantage in the beginning, so then I took advantage of somebody else.

3878
02:23:23,730 --> 02:23:26,950
But now, like, I feel like we're not gonna be able to make it, guys.

3879
02:23:27,790 --> 02:23:30,010
Alright, Doki, good luck.

3880
02:23:30,250 --> 02:23:32,090
Good luck, good luck, good luck, guys!

3881
02:23:32,270 --> 02:23:32,830
Good luck!

3882
02:23:36,440 --> 02:23:37,180
Hi, Doki.

3883
02:23:37,760 --> 02:23:38,940
Hey, are you a truther?

3884
02:23:40,140 --> 02:23:42,620
I have been truthful with everyone I've played against.

3885
02:23:42,740 --> 02:23:42,860
Really?

3886
02:23:43,580 --> 02:23:45,100
How many points do you have?

3887
02:23:46,120 --> 02:23:46,960
I have 15.

3888
02:23:47,180 --> 02:23:47,660
15?

3889
02:23:47,980 --> 02:23:49,060
I have 6.

3890
02:23:50,960 --> 02:23:52,840
I've been truthful, so people...

3891
02:23:52,840 --> 02:23:55,460
No, people have been taking advantage of me.

3892
02:23:57,020 --> 02:23:58,520
Because I've been telling the truth.

3893
02:23:58,700 --> 02:23:58,840
As a truther?

3894
02:23:59,120 --> 02:23:59,540
Yeah!

3895
02:24:00,460 --> 02:24:02,960
I got, like, squitted in the first game.

3896
02:24:03,080 --> 02:24:04,900
And then he, like, took advantage of me.

3897
02:24:04,960 --> 02:24:07,980
And then I got some other guy with, like, a creeper thing.

3898
02:24:08,120 --> 02:24:09,060
A creeper skin.

3899
02:24:09,300 --> 02:24:12,980
And then he also, like, made me lose almost everybody.

3900
02:24:13,920 --> 02:24:14,900
So, like... What do you have?

3901
02:24:15,280 --> 02:24:16,240
I have...

3902
02:24:17,040 --> 02:24:17,820
I have a skull.

3903
02:24:19,040 --> 02:24:19,800
You have a skull?

3904
02:24:20,040 --> 02:24:20,280
Yeah.

3905
02:24:21,780 --> 02:24:23,060
Oh my god, thank you!

3906
02:24:24,860 --> 02:24:26,340
This is the way I've been doing it with everyone.

3907
02:24:26,660 --> 02:24:29,160
I give them the first win, and then we go back and forth.

3908
02:24:29,400 --> 02:24:32,560
You don't have to, but that's the way I've been doing it.

3909
02:24:32,720 --> 02:24:34,480
Wait, can I have another point, though?

3910
02:24:34,520 --> 02:24:36,200
Because I might get a little...

3911
02:24:36,220 --> 02:24:36,500
eliminated.

3912
02:24:39,080 --> 02:24:39,520
Sure.

3913
02:24:40,280 --> 02:24:40,720
Yay!

3914
02:24:41,200 --> 02:24:41,820
Thank you!

3915
02:24:42,620 --> 02:24:44,180
I have a knife.

3916
02:24:44,620 --> 02:24:45,060
Knife?

3917
02:24:45,180 --> 02:24:45,500
Okay.

3918
02:24:47,040 --> 02:24:48,340
Oh, you put the skull.

3919
02:24:48,720 --> 02:24:49,860
You wouldn't lie, right?

3920
02:24:50,940 --> 02:24:52,300
Have you been telling the truth?

3921
02:24:52,460 --> 02:24:52,900
I have not lied a single time.

3922
02:24:53,040 --> 02:24:54,240
You haven't lied a single time?

3923
02:24:54,400 --> 02:24:54,760
Oh, okay.

3924
02:24:55,400 --> 02:24:57,640
You said you went against the creeper skin?

3925
02:24:57,760 --> 02:24:59,140
No, no, they lied to me.

3926
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:00,900
They kept lying.

3927
02:25:01,060 --> 02:25:01,800
Because they were, like...

3928
02:25:01,800 --> 02:25:05,160
They gave me... They told the truth for the first two rounds.

3929
02:25:06,220 --> 02:25:07,660
And then they told lies in the last...

3930
02:25:07,660 --> 02:25:09,400
the last two rounds to me.

3931
02:25:10,620 --> 02:25:11,860
So then they, like, won.

3932
02:25:12,240 --> 02:25:12,640
Yeah.

3933
02:25:13,060 --> 02:25:14,220
So they took advantage.

3934
02:25:14,760 --> 02:25:15,860
Because they were, like...

3935
02:25:16,660 --> 02:25:19,800
Because they were, like, Oh, I'm going to tell the truth the entire time.

3936
02:25:19,880 --> 02:25:20,260
Like, really?

3937
02:25:20,460 --> 02:25:21,700
So then I just trusted him.

3938
02:25:22,120 --> 02:25:22,700
Thank you!

3939
02:25:24,560 --> 02:25:24,960
Alright.

3940
02:25:25,200 --> 02:25:25,600
Alright.

3941
02:25:25,700 --> 02:25:26,960
I'll let you win the next one.

3942
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:28,720
Alright.

3943
02:25:30,340 --> 02:25:36,560
See, I thought in the last game, this is where, like, we were going to start seeing you know, the real sides of people.

3944
02:25:36,600 --> 02:25:37,200
The real sides?

3945
02:25:37,580 --> 02:25:38,900
But you wouldn't lie, though.

3946
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:40,900
I wouldn't.

3947
02:25:40,900 --> 02:25:41,300
I haven't.

3948
02:25:41,460 --> 02:25:44,140
So can the last round, can I have the two points then?

3949
02:25:45,620 --> 02:25:46,880
So you get six, I get two?

3950
02:25:47,120 --> 02:25:47,600
Yeah.

3951
02:25:48,240 --> 02:25:50,340
Because you're in a comfortable place, aren't you?

3952
02:25:51,540 --> 02:25:52,480
I don't know.

3953
02:25:52,600 --> 02:25:53,800
Wait, what's your points?

3954
02:25:55,340 --> 02:25:56,700
Uh, well, I had...

3955
02:25:56,700 --> 02:25:57,460
I've got 15.

3956
02:25:58,200 --> 02:25:58,680
Oh!

3957
02:25:59,660 --> 02:26:00,640
Yeah, no, you're comfortable.

3958
02:26:00,640 --> 02:26:01,780
I don't know how...

3959
02:26:01,780 --> 02:26:06,060
I saw, like, some people, I heard it was, like, 12 and, like, 7.

3960
02:26:07,060 --> 02:26:08,360
So I think you're in a comfortable place.

3961
02:26:08,820 --> 02:26:09,440
I have a knife.

3962
02:26:10,440 --> 02:26:11,120
You have a knife?

3963
02:26:11,240 --> 02:26:11,420
Okay.

3964
02:26:11,560 --> 02:26:12,620
Yeah, and I'm telling the truth.

3965
02:26:13,760 --> 02:26:14,500
I believe you.

3966
02:26:14,720 --> 02:26:16,780
Yeah, because you've been telling the truth this entire time.

3967
02:26:19,040 --> 02:26:23,060
I wonder, though, how many people are going to do, kind of, what we're doing right now.

3968
02:26:23,220 --> 02:26:24,460
What, like, exchanging stuff?

3969
02:26:25,500 --> 02:26:25,860
Yeah.

3970
02:26:26,440 --> 02:26:28,180
So it all kind of levels out at the end.

3971
02:26:30,640 --> 02:26:31,520
I have, like, 7 points.

3972
02:26:32,160 --> 02:26:34,460
So I think you should be fine.

3973
02:26:36,020 --> 02:26:38,340
That means there's got to be people with, like, 25, right?

3974
02:26:38,720 --> 02:26:40,400
I think the highest I heard was 20.

3975
02:26:41,800 --> 02:26:42,920
Alright, what do you have?

3976
02:26:43,060 --> 02:26:43,900
Even that's still insane.

3977
02:26:44,800 --> 02:26:45,400
I've got...

3978
02:26:45,400 --> 02:26:47,300
So are you okay if I take the last 2 points?

3979
02:26:48,240 --> 02:26:49,000
I'm fine with that.

3980
02:26:49,200 --> 02:26:49,560
Oh!

3981
02:26:49,600 --> 02:26:50,260
Okay, thank you!

3982
02:26:51,880 --> 02:26:52,640
What do you have?

3983
02:26:53,880 --> 02:26:54,280
Paper.

3984
02:26:54,480 --> 02:26:54,880
Paper?

3985
02:26:55,900 --> 02:26:56,300
Bye!

3986
02:26:58,260 --> 02:27:02,660
Did you ever play, or did you ever watch Splitter Steel as a kid?

3987
02:27:02,660 --> 02:27:03,220
Splitter Steel?

3988
02:27:04,040 --> 02:27:04,780
Wait, what's that?

3989
02:27:06,120 --> 02:27:13,000
Like, any game shows where two people have to decide whether they, like, if they're given, like, money, they have to choose Splitter Steel.

3990
02:27:13,020 --> 02:27:18,620
Oh, and then, like, you're like, oh, if you pick the money up, then you'll lose it for everybody, like, type deal?

3991
02:27:18,860 --> 02:27:19,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3992
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,680
I never thought I'd be doing that in real life.

3993
02:27:23,760 --> 02:27:24,860
I know, it's actually crazy.

3994
02:27:25,020 --> 02:27:26,460
I can't believe people are liars still.

3995
02:27:26,460 --> 02:27:29,020
Thank you so much for the points, I really appreciate it.

3996
02:27:29,100 --> 02:27:29,480
How many do you have?

3997
02:27:29,900 --> 02:27:31,900
I have, I think, I have...

3998
02:27:31,900 --> 02:27:33,080
You lost 15 minutes!

3999
02:27:36,080 --> 02:27:36,880
Guilt tripping!

4000
02:27:37,580 --> 02:27:38,940
I got eliminated!

4001
02:27:40,400 --> 02:27:41,860
You got eliminated?

4002
02:27:42,100 --> 02:27:42,860
How many points do you have?

4003
02:27:42,900 --> 02:27:43,220
I survived!

4004
02:27:44,580 --> 02:27:46,640
No way, no way!

4005
02:27:49,440 --> 02:27:50,980
Wait, Sleepy, you got eliminated too!

4006
02:27:52,040 --> 02:27:53,360
Sleepy, you got eliminated!

4007
02:27:53,360 --> 02:27:54,720
Mando, I told you, bro.

4008
02:27:55,780 --> 02:27:56,260
Mando.

4009
02:27:59,880 --> 02:28:01,720
I can't lie to them, man.

4010
02:28:01,740 --> 02:28:02,480
I can't.

4011
02:28:03,160 --> 02:28:04,500
It's all thanks to you.

4012
02:28:05,220 --> 02:28:05,700
What?

4013
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:06,740
I didn't do nothing.

4014
02:28:07,080 --> 02:28:08,560
How many points did you get?

4015
02:28:09,700 --> 02:28:10,960
Oh, that is actually...

4016
02:28:10,960 --> 02:28:12,520
That is evil!

4017
02:28:12,800 --> 02:28:14,360
You're actually the villain, though.

4018
02:28:16,860 --> 02:28:18,120
I appreciate you.

4019
02:28:18,240 --> 02:28:22,700
You lost 2 minutes out of 19.

4020
02:28:23,800 --> 02:28:25,660
The next day is...

4021
02:28:25,660 --> 02:28:28,020
Mando, you lost to Eram!

4022
02:28:29,120 --> 02:28:29,620
It's fine.

4023
02:28:30,340 --> 02:28:31,860
Oh, yeah, no, I...

4024
02:28:31,860 --> 02:28:35,080
Not only 30 people are just gone now.

4025
02:28:36,280 --> 02:28:39,340
I can't believe it!

4026
02:28:39,920 --> 02:28:42,400
Are you okay?

4027
02:28:43,060 --> 02:28:43,960
Are you okay, man?

4028
02:28:45,480 --> 02:28:47,520
Mando, we went down together!

4029
02:28:48,460 --> 02:28:49,940
I trusted you!

4030
02:28:50,320 --> 02:28:51,900
I trusted you!

4031
02:28:53,360 --> 02:28:54,320
It wasn't enough, man!

4032
02:28:55,500 --> 02:28:56,460
Oh, man!

4033
02:28:57,240 --> 02:28:58,580
This got dead-lighted me at the end.

4034
02:28:59,560 --> 02:29:01,240
I can't believe it!

4035
02:29:01,240 --> 02:29:03,180
I can't believe it!

4036
02:29:03,180 --> 02:29:05,220
I made it to the next day!

4037
02:29:05,760 --> 02:29:06,640
That's probably why it's worth it.

4038
02:29:07,660 --> 02:29:10,080
Guys, alright, turn off emote mode only.

4039
02:29:10,120 --> 02:29:11,480
Turn off emote mode.

4040
02:29:12,720 --> 02:29:13,800
Like, easily, too.

4041
02:29:13,940 --> 02:29:15,940
We were 6 points away from winning.

4042
02:29:16,960 --> 02:29:20,540
No, imagine if there was some random person doing it.

4043
02:29:20,540 --> 02:29:22,500
Oh, my God!

4044
02:29:24,740 --> 02:29:28,860
Guys, if all else fails, it's guilt-tripping time!

4045
02:29:32,040 --> 02:29:33,120
I love Daddy.

4046
02:29:33,760 --> 02:29:35,500
That was evil!

4047
02:29:38,280 --> 02:29:39,980
How is that evil?

4048
02:29:41,460 --> 02:29:42,920
I made it through!

4049
02:29:43,200 --> 02:29:43,520
No!

4050
02:29:44,220 --> 02:29:45,580
You're so...

4051
02:29:45,580 --> 02:29:48,100
You're so going to hell!

4052
02:29:48,640 --> 02:29:49,360
Guys!

4053
02:29:49,660 --> 02:29:50,520
I made it!

4054
02:29:50,540 --> 02:29:50,780
I made it!

4055
02:29:51,360 --> 02:29:52,680
Let's fucking go!

4056
02:29:53,700 --> 02:29:57,180
I made it to the next round!

4057
02:29:58,620 --> 02:30:00,540
People gave me free points!

4058
02:30:01,520 --> 02:30:02,760
And I survived!

4059
02:30:07,820 --> 02:30:09,260
Oh, my God!

4060
02:30:10,900 --> 02:30:11,900
Let's do it!

4061
02:30:12,680 --> 02:30:14,840
Why would they scare me like that?

4062
02:30:15,480 --> 02:30:17,680
No, I'm just going to win!

4063
02:30:17,800 --> 02:30:18,420
I'm just going to win!

4064
02:30:18,500 --> 02:30:18,940
I won, bro!

4065
02:30:20,540 --> 02:30:22,140
It was just a little white lie!

4066
02:30:22,640 --> 02:30:23,080
Guys!

4067
02:30:24,820 --> 02:30:26,700
Just a little white lie!

4068
02:30:28,880 --> 02:30:29,800
Oh, my God!

4069
02:30:29,800 --> 02:30:30,160
Oh, my God!

4070
02:30:31,520 --> 02:30:31,960
Yeah!

4071
02:30:33,020 --> 02:30:33,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

4072
02:30:33,840 --> 02:30:34,700
How many points did you get again?

4073
02:30:35,940 --> 02:30:37,080
I got 19.

4074
02:30:38,160 --> 02:30:39,060
Oh, my God!

4075
02:30:39,560 --> 02:30:40,660
Yeah, you know how I did it?

4076
02:30:41,360 --> 02:30:42,680
I guilt-tripped it.

4077
02:30:42,800 --> 02:30:44,980
I was like, I only have three points.

4078
02:30:45,100 --> 02:30:48,540
Can I please have some points so I can stay in the round a little longer?

4079
02:30:48,540 --> 02:30:49,080
Oh, my God!

4080
02:30:49,160 --> 02:30:50,080
So you did that!

4081
02:30:50,740 --> 02:30:53,000
And then they gave me three rounds!

4082
02:30:53,340 --> 02:30:55,540
Both players gave me three rounds!

4083
02:30:56,040 --> 02:30:56,820
Did you die?

4084
02:30:56,960 --> 02:30:57,860
Did those players die?

4085
02:30:58,240 --> 02:30:59,660
No, no, they didn't die.

4086
02:31:00,580 --> 02:31:02,120
Because they were already comfortable.

4087
02:31:03,200 --> 02:31:09,540
They were already comfortable, so I was like, hey, you guys are going to make it anyway, so like, can I have the three rounds?

4088
02:31:09,660 --> 02:31:10,840
I only have three points.

4089
02:31:11,060 --> 02:31:11,540
Oh, my God!

4090
02:31:14,540 --> 02:31:16,400
Oh, a lot of my friends lived!

4091
02:31:16,820 --> 02:31:17,380
Oh, nice!

4092
02:31:17,520 --> 02:31:19,420
I guess we're living to the next day.

4093
02:31:20,620 --> 02:31:21,640
Oh, my God, Badoki.

4094
02:31:22,060 --> 02:31:23,180
I feel so bad.

4095
02:31:23,280 --> 02:31:24,840
I lost to one person.

4096
02:31:25,100 --> 02:31:25,900
But who did you lie to?

4097
02:31:29,140 --> 02:31:29,500
Um...

4098
02:31:29,500 --> 02:31:35,060
There was a person who lied to me first, and I was like, oh... I want to go see who lost to the last round.

4099
02:31:35,920 --> 02:31:38,040
And then I just lied to them at the last round.

4100
02:31:38,220 --> 02:31:39,660
Oh, they deserve it.

4101
02:31:39,660 --> 02:31:40,220
They deserve it.

4102
02:31:40,220 --> 02:31:40,680
We made it.

4103
02:31:40,760 --> 02:31:41,660
They deserve it.

4104
02:31:41,660 --> 02:31:45,000
I thought it was funny that Mendo and Sleepy got kicked.

4105
02:31:46,360 --> 02:31:46,920
I know!

4106
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:47,600
That's crazy!

4107
02:31:47,780 --> 02:31:48,620
I think they would have won.

4108
02:31:49,080 --> 02:31:49,600
Sleepy...

4109
02:31:49,600 --> 02:31:52,680
Sleepy was so cocky too earlier.

4110
02:31:53,080 --> 02:31:54,620
He was like, I got the point!

4111
02:31:56,520 --> 02:31:57,040
Yeah...

4112
02:31:58,800 --> 02:32:01,280
I thought Sleepy was in for sure.

4113
02:32:01,580 --> 02:32:02,260
Yeah, me too.

4114
02:32:02,300 --> 02:32:04,280
I was not expecting his elimination.

4115
02:32:06,200 --> 02:32:07,580
Oh, my... Wait, what's the now?

4116
02:32:07,640 --> 02:32:08,880
It's time to decide your future.

4117
02:32:09,180 --> 02:32:10,200
What the fuck is that?

4118
02:32:10,600 --> 02:32:12,040
Dave got eliminated.

4119
02:32:13,920 --> 02:32:15,220
I wonder what that is.

4120
02:32:15,220 --> 02:32:17,560
Hi, how many points did you end up with?

4121
02:32:17,560 --> 02:32:18,580
Yeah, how many points did you have?

4122
02:32:18,720 --> 02:32:19,940
You didn't save Mendo.

4123
02:32:20,940 --> 02:32:22,820
Okay, whatever.

4124
02:32:23,280 --> 02:32:24,860
You didn't even save Mendo.

4125
02:32:28,940 --> 02:32:30,240
Oh, we woke up!

4126
02:32:30,520 --> 02:32:32,540
We woke up!

4127
02:32:32,980 --> 02:32:33,600
Em, did you make it?

4128
02:32:34,080 --> 02:32:34,660
I did make it!

4129
02:32:35,260 --> 02:32:36,840
Use this to talk to...

4130
02:32:38,280 --> 02:32:39,100
Let's go!

4131
02:32:39,240 --> 02:32:39,880
We made it!

4132
02:32:40,160 --> 02:32:40,720
Let's go!

4133
02:32:41,240 --> 02:32:42,960
We have the last piece to win!

4134
02:32:45,300 --> 02:32:46,920
Find the last one!

4135
02:32:46,940 --> 02:32:47,420
We did it!

4136
02:32:47,540 --> 02:32:51,260
You see, people lie but rock what they had.

4137
02:32:51,440 --> 02:32:52,940
Skull, blade, or paper.

4138
02:32:53,200 --> 02:32:53,720
Or scroll.

4139
02:32:54,180 --> 02:32:57,420
I am at another level of lying.

4140
02:33:02,840 --> 02:33:05,480
I was at a different level.

4141
02:33:11,080 --> 02:33:12,280
You very...

4142
02:33:13,500 --> 02:33:14,300
very cool.

4143
02:33:15,780 --> 02:33:18,960
Nobody thought about lying to pull out the points.

4144
02:33:20,900 --> 02:33:21,940
We are at another level.

4145
02:33:24,260 --> 02:33:25,440
We are at another level.

4146
02:33:25,460 --> 02:33:25,680
We are at another level.

4147
02:33:26,240 --> 02:33:27,440
We are at another level.

4148
02:33:27,440 --> 02:33:29,400
I am not going out day one.

4149
02:33:29,600 --> 02:33:30,660
I am not going out day one.

4150
02:33:30,860 --> 02:33:31,380
How many did you have?

4151
02:33:32,280 --> 02:33:32,680
Yay!

4152
02:33:34,180 --> 02:33:35,680
No, I traded a bunch of them.

4153
02:33:35,740 --> 02:33:36,280
I had one round.

4154
02:33:36,440 --> 02:33:37,280
Big brain.

4155
02:33:39,220 --> 02:33:40,600
It's just twisted truth.

4156
02:33:40,720 --> 02:33:42,280
You traded all the way until the last one.

4157
02:33:42,960 --> 02:33:44,400
The last one was the person who lied to me.

4158
02:33:44,500 --> 02:33:48,540
Yeah, with everyone I was doing the first two we traded so we each get two points.

4159
02:33:48,540 --> 02:33:50,020
This guy lied to me.

4160
02:33:50,120 --> 02:33:52,060
This guy just...

4161
02:33:52,060 --> 02:33:52,560
Yeah!

4162
02:33:52,560 --> 02:33:53,780
He lied to me!

4163
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:55,000
You lied to him!

4164
02:33:55,380 --> 02:33:56,280
I did not!

4165
02:33:56,680 --> 02:33:57,040
Yeah!

4166
02:33:59,620 --> 02:34:00,580
He did.

4167
02:34:00,780 --> 02:34:02,760
I traded one though.

4168
02:34:02,800 --> 02:34:03,360
We traded the first time.

4169
02:34:04,540 --> 02:34:06,320
And then the last two we played for real.

4170
02:34:06,560 --> 02:34:07,980
Yeah, but then you lied!

4171
02:34:09,940 --> 02:34:11,160
But we were playing for real.

4172
02:34:11,740 --> 02:34:12,380
Yeah!

4173
02:34:15,840 --> 02:34:19,700
Yeah, and the way I played the game was I was a truthful person.

4174
02:34:20,860 --> 02:34:23,480
And you almost lied until you started lying.

4175
02:34:24,800 --> 02:34:27,920
Yeah, he caused he caused my joker arc.

4176
02:34:28,100 --> 02:34:29,980
I was a truthful person.

4177
02:34:30,140 --> 02:34:31,540
He corrupted me.

4178
02:34:32,080 --> 02:34:36,980
I was a truther until he corrupted me so I had to start lying.

4179
02:34:38,040 --> 02:34:40,100
I had to start guilt tripping people.

4180
02:34:40,940 --> 02:34:43,300
Yeah, there was no other choice.

4181
02:34:43,700 --> 02:34:45,460
My joker arc started it.

4182
02:34:46,120 --> 02:34:47,580
Oh, do not leave the server.

4183
02:34:47,800 --> 02:34:49,080
What are we supposed to do?

4184
02:34:49,300 --> 02:34:50,500
Yeah, we're not allowed to leave the server right now.

4185
02:34:50,920 --> 02:34:53,520
Yeah, I used to be a very trustworthy person.

4186
02:34:53,880 --> 02:34:54,980
And now people...

4187
02:34:55,680 --> 02:34:56,800
Now I have to lie.

4188
02:34:57,220 --> 02:34:57,620
Alright.

4189
02:34:58,460 --> 02:34:58,900
Yeah.

4190
02:35:01,920 --> 02:35:03,760
What do we even get for the easter eggs?

4191
02:35:04,920 --> 02:35:05,600
I don't know.

4192
02:35:05,640 --> 02:35:06,920
What if you get a total drama island?

4193
02:35:06,980 --> 02:35:08,940
Where you don't get kicked out.

4194
02:35:09,240 --> 02:35:10,760
Oh, like if you get all ten.

4195
02:35:10,800 --> 02:35:12,700
Yeah, but then everybody's gonna try and get ten then.

4196
02:35:12,860 --> 02:35:14,440
And then they can't kick out anyone after.

4197
02:35:15,620 --> 02:35:16,760
Yeah, but not everyone.

4198
02:35:16,860 --> 02:35:17,940
Like you didn't try and get ten.

4199
02:35:18,220 --> 02:35:19,980
Yeah, but like now I'm going to try.

4200
02:35:20,140 --> 02:35:21,720
We have six days of this.

4201
02:35:25,600 --> 02:35:31,540
And the server And the server is like up like an hour like more than an hour before the event starts too.

4202
02:35:33,320 --> 02:35:36,380
Cause I logged into the server at like 11.

4203
02:35:37,960 --> 02:35:38,360
Yeah.

4204
02:35:39,420 --> 02:35:40,420
Wait, where are you?

4205
02:35:40,460 --> 02:35:41,100
I lost you.

4206
02:35:41,400 --> 02:35:42,540
I'm right behind you, man.

4207
02:35:42,720 --> 02:35:43,560
Oh, what the heck?

4208
02:35:43,580 --> 02:35:44,440
You're camouflaged.

4209
02:35:44,920 --> 02:35:45,320
Eggs?

4210
02:35:47,340 --> 02:35:48,960
I don't think there's any eggs here.

4211
02:35:50,140 --> 02:35:51,100
There's one over here.

4212
02:35:51,200 --> 02:35:51,600
Follow me.

4213
02:35:51,620 --> 02:35:52,260
Oh, okay.

4214
02:35:53,140 --> 02:35:54,040
I only have one.

4215
02:35:54,240 --> 02:35:55,760
I haven't been paying attention.

4216
02:35:57,700 --> 02:35:58,520
Here, follow me.

4217
02:35:58,520 --> 02:36:00,200
Well, I could get eliminated tomorrow, chat.

4218
02:36:01,320 --> 02:36:04,740
Like, the thing is you can get eliminated at any day.

4219
02:36:04,780 --> 02:36:05,240
Oh my god, yeah.

4220
02:36:05,420 --> 02:36:05,840
Yeah, right?

4221
02:36:06,980 --> 02:36:07,600
Is there an egg here, guys?

4222
02:36:07,820 --> 02:36:08,880
Yeah, there should be, right?

4223
02:36:09,100 --> 02:36:10,160
Oh, there it is.

4224
02:36:10,360 --> 02:36:10,580
Got it.

4225
02:36:10,640 --> 02:36:11,200
Wait, where is it?

4226
02:36:12,560 --> 02:36:15,300
Does anybody know where like the tenth egg is?

4227
02:36:15,300 --> 02:36:15,680
What?

4228
02:36:16,900 --> 02:36:18,040
Stand where I am.

4229
02:36:18,040 --> 02:36:18,600
Stand where I am.

4230
02:36:18,600 --> 02:36:18,980
Come here.

4231
02:36:19,040 --> 02:36:19,320
Come here.

4232
02:36:20,840 --> 02:36:22,860
Stand where I am and then up.

4233
02:36:24,840 --> 02:36:25,580
Oh, snap.

4234
02:36:25,760 --> 02:36:27,780
They're selecting people for tiebreakers.

4235
02:36:27,860 --> 02:36:28,260
Jump.

4236
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:30,420
Oh, I got it.

4237
02:36:30,480 --> 02:36:30,820
I got it.

4238
02:36:31,740 --> 02:36:34,140
Wait, there's tiebreakers?

4239
02:36:34,140 --> 02:36:34,480
It's right here.

4240
02:36:34,480 --> 02:36:34,800
It's right here.

4241
02:36:35,040 --> 02:36:39,080
Yeah, because apparently people tied with points and then they're gonna duke it out.

4242
02:36:41,100 --> 02:36:42,280
Wait, how do we...

4243
02:36:42,840 --> 02:36:44,280
How do we like find it?

4244
02:36:44,380 --> 02:36:44,780
Oh, yeah.

4245
02:36:44,840 --> 02:36:45,440
I hit that one.

4246
02:36:50,180 --> 02:36:53,260
Oh, I had 19 points, so like...

4247
02:36:53,260 --> 02:36:54,140
No, no, no.

4248
02:36:54,240 --> 02:36:56,760
Tiebreakers are for the people who weren't in our room.

4249
02:36:57,200 --> 02:36:57,600
Oh!

4250
02:36:59,600 --> 02:37:00,000
Wait.

4251
02:37:00,020 --> 02:37:01,900
Our room was the only one with no tiebreaker.

4252
02:37:02,120 --> 02:37:02,760
Oh, nice.

4253
02:37:03,960 --> 02:37:04,360
Nice.

4254
02:37:05,980 --> 02:37:07,520
There's two in this room, Ducky.

4255
02:37:11,720 --> 02:37:12,120
Where?

4256
02:37:12,720 --> 02:37:14,140
There is a TV over there.

4257
02:37:14,220 --> 02:37:14,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4258
02:37:15,060 --> 02:37:15,380
I see it.

4259
02:37:16,220 --> 02:37:17,720
Wait, have you found all ten already?

4260
02:37:18,640 --> 02:37:19,300
No, no, no.

4261
02:37:19,300 --> 02:37:20,140
I only found eight.

4262
02:37:20,280 --> 02:37:20,780
Oh, my...

4263
02:37:21,740 --> 02:37:23,420
And then there's another one over here.

4264
02:37:23,800 --> 02:37:24,200
Okay.

4265
02:37:24,320 --> 02:37:25,160
I have three.

4266
02:37:27,140 --> 02:37:28,940
I wonder if we can watch the tiebreaker.

4267
02:37:29,400 --> 02:37:30,240
I'm gonna be real.

4268
02:37:30,360 --> 02:37:33,320
I know Dr. Gluon is like...

4269
02:37:33,320 --> 02:37:33,840
I'm gonna be real.

4270
02:37:33,840 --> 02:37:33,840
I know Dr. Gluon is like...

4271
02:37:33,840 --> 02:37:36,000
I mean, we're not allowed to leave yet.

4272
02:37:36,020 --> 02:37:37,620
So we should be allowed to watch the tiebreaker.

4273
02:37:38,020 --> 02:37:39,160
I don't think I have any.

4274
02:37:39,660 --> 02:37:43,780
Well, you're allowed to if you watch the stream.

4275
02:37:47,900 --> 02:37:49,100
Oh, I'm over.

4276
02:37:49,820 --> 02:37:51,480
I had 18.

4277
02:37:51,520 --> 02:37:52,260
I had 16.

4278
02:37:53,100 --> 02:37:55,560
I almost got somebody eliminated, though.

4279
02:37:55,680 --> 02:37:57,720
Because they were like, what, 17 or something?

4280
02:38:00,340 --> 02:38:02,200
They literally just...

4281
02:38:02,200 --> 02:38:04,700
Oh, my God.

4282
02:38:04,840 --> 02:38:05,320
I'm nervous.

4283
02:38:06,020 --> 02:38:06,940
How do we do this?

4284
02:38:07,940 --> 02:38:10,540
I could have let them die.

4285
02:38:13,440 --> 02:38:14,480
And then one right here.

4286
02:38:14,680 --> 02:38:15,220
Oh, okay.

4287
02:38:15,340 --> 02:38:16,000
Oh, now I have seven.

4288
02:38:16,320 --> 02:38:17,800
Wait, how did you have eight then?

4289
02:38:18,080 --> 02:38:18,960
Where's the eighth one?

4290
02:38:19,300 --> 02:38:20,800
There should be another one right here.

4291
02:38:21,980 --> 02:38:22,580
Wait, where?

4292
02:38:22,680 --> 02:38:22,980
What tree?

4293
02:38:24,560 --> 02:38:26,220
Contestants will compete in our battle.

4294
02:38:29,460 --> 02:38:30,860
Where was the last one you got?

4295
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:31,440
Oh, over here.

4296
02:38:31,500 --> 02:38:31,740
Over here.

4297
02:38:31,740 --> 02:38:32,280
Oh, okay.

4298
02:38:32,720 --> 02:38:34,000
People said there's some outside.

4299
02:38:35,680 --> 02:38:37,900
Yeah, we got the tree outside already.

4300
02:38:38,100 --> 02:38:39,540
Wait, is this the same outside?

4301
02:38:39,820 --> 02:38:41,480
No, this is a different outside.

4302
02:38:41,480 --> 02:38:42,780
Yeah, there should be more around here.

4303
02:38:43,640 --> 02:38:44,900
Oh, are we gonna watch them?

4304
02:38:45,420 --> 02:38:46,100
I don't know.

4305
02:38:46,980 --> 02:38:47,880
Oh, we're right here.

4306
02:38:48,920 --> 02:38:51,080
Yeah, I got it.

4307
02:38:51,400 --> 02:38:52,560
Alright, let's see if we watch them.

4308
02:38:53,660 --> 02:38:54,460
Oh, wait.

4309
02:38:54,700 --> 02:38:55,660
I guess we watch.

4310
02:38:56,580 --> 02:38:57,520
Oh, my God.

4311
02:38:57,600 --> 02:38:58,080
I got so scared.

4312
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:00,320
Oh, my God.

4313
02:39:00,320 --> 02:39:01,600
Wait, that's so cool.

4314
02:39:02,440 --> 02:39:03,700
Guys, write this down, guys.

4315
02:39:03,800 --> 02:39:06,000
We're gonna steal... I mean, borrow this for our own stuff.

4316
02:39:06,320 --> 02:39:07,080
For our own...

4317
02:39:08,320 --> 02:39:10,220
Hey, Gumi, where are you?

4318
02:39:12,020 --> 02:39:13,020
Selkie, where are you going?

4319
02:39:13,140 --> 02:39:13,460
Oh, wait.

4320
02:39:13,480 --> 02:39:13,780
I'm here.

4321
02:39:14,460 --> 02:39:15,340
Guys, write this down.

4322
02:39:17,600 --> 02:39:19,480
Look, look, look.

4323
02:39:19,640 --> 02:39:20,820
See, people are running with particles.

4324
02:39:21,040 --> 02:39:22,460
If they have a particle, you don't want to be near them.

4325
02:39:22,540 --> 02:39:23,640
You just need to run away, you know?

4326
02:39:23,760 --> 02:39:24,440
Oh, my God.

4327
02:39:24,740 --> 02:39:26,020
This is like parkour tag.

4328
02:39:28,200 --> 02:39:29,980
Oh, I'm actually gonna buy it.

4329
02:39:34,900 --> 02:39:37,100
The sound effect is so scary.

4330
02:39:37,860 --> 02:39:38,380
Oh!

4331
02:39:40,280 --> 02:39:41,720
It's like crab game.

4332
02:39:45,120 --> 02:39:46,380
Go, Kate, go!

4333
02:39:46,840 --> 02:39:47,760
Go, Kate, go!

4334
02:39:49,540 --> 02:39:52,140
It's just like crab game, you know, with the stick?

4335
02:39:52,360 --> 02:39:53,420
Yeah, the hot potato.

4336
02:39:53,960 --> 02:39:55,040
Go, Kate, go!

4337
02:39:55,500 --> 02:39:56,020
Nice.

4338
02:39:58,300 --> 02:40:00,080
That is not enough time.

4339
02:40:01,320 --> 02:40:04,040
That is absolutely not enough time.

4340
02:40:04,400 --> 02:40:06,000
I mean, there's no way!

4341
02:40:08,680 --> 02:40:09,420
They left!

4342
02:40:13,760 --> 02:40:15,980
That is not enough time.

4343
02:40:15,980 --> 02:40:17,880
Yeah, it's like 20 seconds.

4344
02:40:18,260 --> 02:40:27,880
It's so crazy that you got through with 16 points and Open Water lost and I think he had 17 because...

4345
02:40:28,080 --> 02:40:29,500
The green was so competitive.

4346
02:40:30,160 --> 02:40:31,480
You just shift it over there.

4347
02:40:31,640 --> 02:40:32,000
Oh, no.

4348
02:40:32,680 --> 02:40:33,160
Yeah.

4349
02:40:34,760 --> 02:40:36,740
So do you have to try and hit the other player?

4350
02:40:36,760 --> 02:40:37,760
You can't even see.

4351
02:40:40,140 --> 02:40:42,080
They just have like people flying around.

4352
02:40:42,100 --> 02:40:42,380
The curse is consumed.

4353
02:40:44,220 --> 02:40:48,800
Oh, I guess like one elimination criteria met.

4354
02:40:48,940 --> 02:40:49,440
Wait, who lived?

4355
02:40:50,120 --> 02:40:51,080
Who lived?

4356
02:40:51,200 --> 02:40:54,540
I feel like anyone that got like the curse lost automatically.

4357
02:40:55,200 --> 02:40:56,540
Because that was so brutal.

4358
02:40:57,380 --> 02:41:03,100
Yeah, I feel like I feel like if you have the curse you just automatically you automatically lose.

4359
02:41:04,800 --> 02:41:05,560
There's no way.

4360
02:41:05,820 --> 02:41:06,180
Yeah.

4361
02:41:06,760 --> 02:41:07,340
Yeah, yeah.

4362
02:41:08,200 --> 02:41:11,980
Yeah, map's too big and the time's too short there.

4363
02:41:12,120 --> 02:41:13,040
I hope they adjust that.

4364
02:41:13,300 --> 02:41:14,280
It seems pretty unfair.

4365
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,140
Guys, I did not expect to make it today too.

4366
02:41:17,240 --> 02:41:19,300
I thought I was gonna have like a one week vacation.

4367
02:41:19,900 --> 02:41:21,600
Well, I mean like...

4368
02:41:23,420 --> 02:41:25,700
Most likely I'll be eliminated on day 2.

4369
02:41:25,820 --> 02:41:27,600
I don't think I'm gonna...

4370
02:41:30,360 --> 02:41:31,180
No, you're fine.

4371
02:41:31,200 --> 02:41:31,540
You're fine.

4372
02:41:31,600 --> 02:41:31,860
You're fine.

4373
02:41:31,860 --> 02:41:32,520
You took 30 seconds.

4374
02:41:32,860 --> 02:41:34,480
You need to track them the fuck down.

4375
02:41:34,780 --> 02:41:35,520
You need to track them the fuck down.

4376
02:41:35,520 --> 02:41:36,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4377
02:41:36,060 --> 02:41:36,820
No way, no way.

4378
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,420
Maybe... I feel like I feel like I'm gonna get eliminated.

4379
02:41:40,480 --> 02:41:43,220
There's no way I'll live past the second day.

4380
02:41:43,500 --> 02:41:45,280
These guys are Minecraft players.

4381
02:41:47,280 --> 02:41:48,420
Find the tenth egg?

4382
02:41:48,580 --> 02:41:49,280
Ooh, you're right.

4383
02:41:50,120 --> 02:41:51,240
Wait, another one?

4384
02:41:52,160 --> 02:41:53,720
There's another tiebreaker?

4385
02:41:54,340 --> 02:41:58,260
I don't know if you guys knew but I could hear you and I heard all of you guys.

4386
02:41:58,360 --> 02:41:59,040
There's another...

4387
02:41:59,040 --> 02:42:02,300
Okay guys, do you guys know where the Easter eggs are?

4388
02:42:05,540 --> 02:42:06,300
We're gonna try.

4389
02:42:07,120 --> 02:42:09,080
Oh my god, so many tiebreakers.

4390
02:42:09,680 --> 02:42:11,280
I already discovered this.

4391
02:42:12,020 --> 02:42:13,540
Multiple teams needed...

4392
02:42:15,580 --> 02:42:17,160
Multiple teams needed to...

4393
02:42:17,160 --> 02:42:18,880
Oh, I thought that was like everybody.

4394
02:42:19,580 --> 02:42:20,900
Oh, I guess cause like each...

4395
02:42:21,600 --> 02:42:23,620
each color had tiebreakers.

4396
02:42:23,700 --> 02:42:25,500
Guys, stream site time!

4397
02:42:26,140 --> 02:42:27,260
Where's the last...

4398
02:42:27,260 --> 02:42:28,880
Where's the last TV?

4399
02:42:31,420 --> 02:42:32,580
Yeah, for each color.

4400
02:42:32,720 --> 02:42:37,080
Oh, cause ours was the one that didn't have the thing.

4401
02:42:37,840 --> 02:42:38,780
Bottom... guys!

4402
02:42:39,340 --> 02:42:40,920
Bottom right is not an answer.

4403
02:42:45,300 --> 02:42:48,120
Bottom right is not an answer, guys.

4404
02:42:49,760 --> 02:42:51,480
Bottom left, Toki.

4405
02:42:51,760 --> 02:42:53,140
Shit, you're fucking right.

4406
02:42:53,180 --> 02:42:55,000
Let me go check bottom left.

4407
02:42:56,160 --> 02:42:57,240
It's over there.

4408
02:42:57,340 --> 02:42:57,900
It's there!

4409
02:42:58,160 --> 02:42:58,680
Here!

4410
02:42:58,980 --> 02:42:59,840
Up there!

4411
02:43:01,900 --> 02:43:04,720
Now I understand why we had to have emote only.

4412
02:43:05,020 --> 02:43:09,400
If we didn't have emote only, you guys would have fucking broke my, uh...

4413
02:43:09,400 --> 02:43:12,320
You guys would have fucking snitched me out.

4414
02:43:12,480 --> 02:43:13,920
On the guilt trip.

4415
02:43:14,240 --> 02:43:22,500
Hahahaha Hahahaha Hahahaha Hahahaha You guys would have 100% snitched me out.

4416
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:24,880
Hahahaha Where is he?

4417
02:43:24,940 --> 02:43:25,200
Where is he?

4418
02:43:25,220 --> 02:43:25,420
Where is he?

4419
02:43:25,420 --> 02:43:26,700
No, we already got that TV.

4420
02:43:27,200 --> 02:43:28,240
We already got that.

4421
02:43:28,660 --> 02:43:29,420
Alright, he's right here.

4422
02:43:29,480 --> 02:43:29,740
He's right here.

4423
02:43:30,920 --> 02:43:32,040
You've got the silver!

4424
02:43:32,240 --> 02:43:33,680
I have no idea who these people are.

4425
02:43:33,880 --> 02:43:35,740
I guess I'll cheer for... Good luck, y'all.

4426
02:43:35,760 --> 02:43:37,440
I'll cheer for the first person I see.

4427
02:43:38,600 --> 02:43:39,000
Run!

4428
02:43:39,720 --> 02:43:40,580
It's in your name!

4429
02:43:40,760 --> 02:43:41,520
That's what I'm saying.

4430
02:43:41,760 --> 02:43:42,040
It's like...

4431
02:43:42,040 --> 02:43:43,700
Bro, there's no way he's gonna chase...

4432
02:43:44,800 --> 02:43:46,220
20 seconds to get to him.

4433
02:43:46,320 --> 02:43:47,100
There's no way.

4434
02:43:47,880 --> 02:43:50,620
Oh my god, he's so far away, my render is gone.

4435
02:43:51,240 --> 02:43:53,980
Hahahaha He's so...

4436
02:43:53,980 --> 02:43:56,660
He's so far away, my render distance...

4437
02:43:56,660 --> 02:43:58,260
doesn't make it.

4438
02:43:58,760 --> 02:43:59,140
Hahahaha

4439
02:44:04,300 --> 02:44:05,360
Oh my god.

4440
02:44:08,300 --> 02:44:08,860
Chosen...

4441
02:44:08,860 --> 02:44:09,640
Vios.

4442
02:44:10,760 --> 02:44:11,320
Yeah.

4443
02:44:11,380 --> 02:44:12,380
Look at... Everybody knows.

4444
02:44:13,440 --> 02:44:13,720
Oh!

4445
02:44:14,620 --> 02:44:16,020
Wait, he actually caught somebody!

4446
02:44:16,460 --> 02:44:17,360
She did it!

4447
02:44:17,700 --> 02:44:18,420
She caught someone!

4448
02:44:18,560 --> 02:44:20,400
Oh my god, the first person to catch somebody!

4449
02:44:21,460 --> 02:44:22,340
I'm scared.

4450
02:44:24,580 --> 02:44:26,540
Oh my god, the very first one.

4451
02:44:27,780 --> 02:44:28,580
There they are.

4452
02:44:28,720 --> 02:44:29,200
Does Silver have it?

4453
02:44:29,380 --> 02:44:31,720
I don't think there's enough time for someone to get somebody out.

4454
02:44:31,720 --> 02:44:32,580
I don't think Silver has it.

4455
02:44:32,700 --> 02:44:33,140
Yeah, everybody.

4456
02:44:33,480 --> 02:44:34,700
It's too big.

4457
02:44:34,760 --> 02:44:35,540
This game mode is...

4458
02:44:35,540 --> 02:44:37,520
Wait, they didn't test this, surely.

4459
02:44:37,760 --> 02:44:41,880
Hahaha The streamer's not testing stuff?

4460
02:44:42,100 --> 02:44:42,940
No way.

4461
02:44:44,460 --> 02:44:45,640
Wait, what?

4462
02:44:46,220 --> 02:44:46,820
That's it?

4463
02:44:46,940 --> 02:44:47,640
That's so fast.

4464
02:44:47,780 --> 02:44:48,560
Did we get anything for that?

4465
02:44:48,780 --> 02:44:50,420
That was so fucking fast.

4466
02:44:51,500 --> 02:44:51,980
Real.

4467
02:44:52,560 --> 02:44:58,280
Hahaha The streamer is actually testing video games?

4468
02:44:58,440 --> 02:44:59,660
No fucking way.

4469
02:44:59,980 --> 02:45:00,540
I got the one in the dark.

4470
02:45:00,660 --> 02:45:06,280
Oh my god.

4471
02:45:08,240 --> 02:45:09,840
Nah, there's no way.

4472
02:45:11,020 --> 02:45:13,360
Maybe there's a TV in the bedroom.

4473
02:45:13,760 --> 02:45:15,260
Do you think there's TVs in the bedroom?

4474
02:45:15,640 --> 02:45:17,260
I feel like we're missing like one TV.

4475
02:45:17,820 --> 02:45:19,480
We got all the other TVs.

4476
02:45:19,940 --> 02:45:22,040
We're just missing one TV left.

4477
02:45:23,260 --> 02:45:24,200
Check the graveyard.

4478
02:45:24,360 --> 02:45:25,060
There's a graveyard?

4479
02:45:27,520 --> 02:45:29,260
Wait, there's a fucking graveyard?

4480
02:45:31,800 --> 02:45:34,260
Yeah, I wish we had like the invisible flying.

4481
02:45:34,680 --> 02:45:35,940
I think the invisible flying.

4482
02:45:38,120 --> 02:45:38,640
Graveyard.

4483
02:45:38,760 --> 02:45:40,020
Oh, the purple portal.

4484
02:45:40,060 --> 02:45:41,180
You can go through that?

4485
02:45:41,520 --> 02:45:42,620
Okay, let's check it out.

4486
02:45:43,700 --> 02:45:44,740
Let's check it out.

4487
02:45:45,760 --> 02:45:46,360
Oh.

4488
02:45:47,480 --> 02:45:48,080
Nice.

4489
02:45:48,360 --> 02:45:48,860
Alright.

4490
02:45:49,580 --> 02:45:51,000
Let's head to the portal.

4491
02:45:52,120 --> 02:45:53,840
We have two more.

4492
02:45:56,060 --> 02:45:58,440
Wait, I might be like the last VTuber.

4493
02:46:02,520 --> 02:46:03,260
What's this?

4494
02:46:03,820 --> 02:46:06,040
These are everybody that died.

4495
02:46:07,300 --> 02:46:07,900
Right?

4496
02:46:08,800 --> 02:46:10,540
Who the fuck are these people?

4497
02:46:11,060 --> 02:46:11,820
There's no way.

4498
02:46:11,920 --> 02:46:12,600
Wait, that's me!

4499
02:46:13,140 --> 02:46:13,740
Hahaha.

4500
02:46:14,120 --> 02:46:15,020
I'm dead?

4501
02:46:15,640 --> 02:46:15,740
Hahaha.

4502
02:46:21,020 --> 02:46:22,160
Oh my god.

4503
02:46:23,120 --> 02:46:24,760
I'm secretly a ghost.

4504
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:26,680
Alright, guys.

4505
02:46:26,780 --> 02:46:28,100
I don't think they're in the graveyard.

4506
02:46:28,300 --> 02:46:30,340
I don't think the TV's in the graveyard, guys.

4507
02:46:33,500 --> 02:46:35,160
Yeah, this is everybody's.

4508
02:46:35,240 --> 02:46:39,180
Oh, the ones that didn't make it are like a tombstone.

4509
02:46:39,280 --> 02:46:40,020
Oh, I see.

4510
02:46:41,440 --> 02:46:43,120
The ones that didn't make it are...

4511
02:46:43,120 --> 02:46:44,460
Wait, they didn't teleport us.

4512
02:46:45,640 --> 02:46:46,740
Because, like, we're in the graveyard?

4513
02:46:47,380 --> 02:46:48,920
Wait, I didn't get teleported.

4514
02:46:49,940 --> 02:46:50,300
No!

4515
02:46:51,620 --> 02:46:52,080
Oh, wait.

4516
02:46:52,100 --> 02:46:52,880
No, they didn't start yet.

4517
02:46:53,320 --> 02:46:53,680
No.

4518
02:46:56,160 --> 02:46:57,240
They didn't start it yet.

4519
02:46:57,900 --> 02:46:58,620
Yeah, and Asta.

4520
02:46:59,140 --> 02:47:00,800
I'll never find the last one.

4521
02:47:00,940 --> 02:47:01,560
What the fuck?

4522
02:47:01,620 --> 02:47:02,980
Oh, he was so fast.

4523
02:47:08,120 --> 02:47:10,280
Oh, who are the two people that are alive?

4524
02:47:10,400 --> 02:47:11,540
They told us not to disconnect.

4525
02:47:12,020 --> 02:47:12,380
So...

4526
02:47:12,380 --> 02:47:14,120
So, I'm, like...

4527
02:47:14,120 --> 02:47:15,840
I'm, like, being a good person.

4528
02:47:17,460 --> 02:47:18,580
Actually, Axe.

4529
02:47:20,860 --> 02:47:22,560
He said, don't leave.

4530
02:47:22,600 --> 02:47:24,160
So, I'm actually listening.

4531
02:47:26,480 --> 02:47:27,460
There's no way.

4532
02:47:28,360 --> 02:47:29,780
He's not gonna find him.

4533
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:32,280
Bro, he's not gonna fucking find him.

4534
02:47:38,600 --> 02:47:41,140
Bro, he can't even find him.

4535
02:47:42,380 --> 02:47:43,280
That's so fucked.

4536
02:47:44,700 --> 02:47:46,160
It's so fucked.

4537
02:47:46,160 --> 02:47:48,240
He doesn't even know where he is.

4538
02:47:48,800 --> 02:47:50,920
Another VTuber gone.

4539
02:47:52,940 --> 02:47:53,640
Oh, wait.

4540
02:47:53,960 --> 02:47:54,520
Unless...

4541
02:47:54,520 --> 02:47:55,780
Oh, unless...

4542
02:47:55,780 --> 02:47:56,300
Oh, no, no.

4543
02:47:56,340 --> 02:47:56,780
That's the...

4544
02:47:56,780 --> 02:47:58,860
This is so rigged.

4545
02:47:59,280 --> 02:47:59,840
I know.

4546
02:48:01,800 --> 02:48:03,360
I wish we could, like, fly.

4547
02:48:05,120 --> 02:48:07,240
I can't believe you survived.

4548
02:48:07,420 --> 02:48:07,900
Good shit.

4549
02:48:08,340 --> 02:48:08,800
I did.

4550
02:48:09,400 --> 02:48:10,320
Good escort.

4551
02:48:12,380 --> 02:48:13,920
I think I'm, like, intruding.

4552
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:20,840
I'm definitely intruding on something.

4553
02:48:24,480 --> 02:48:25,500
Oh, nice!

4554
02:48:26,280 --> 02:48:27,440
He lived!

4555
02:48:27,840 --> 02:48:28,100
Woo!

4556
02:48:29,980 --> 02:48:32,600
I'll never find the last Easter egg.

4557
02:48:33,380 --> 02:48:35,120
I'll never find it.

4558
02:48:38,420 --> 02:48:41,120
Where the heck is the last TV?

4559
02:48:42,020 --> 02:48:44,820
How was I supposed to know?

4560
02:48:45,160 --> 02:48:48,360
I think this last egg guy has actually scrambled it and it doesn't exist.

4561
02:48:50,220 --> 02:48:51,740
In the end...

4562
02:48:51,740 --> 02:48:53,240
Straight up ate it.

4563
02:48:53,340 --> 02:48:57,540
I hope everybody that lied to me and started my joker arc does not win.

4564
02:48:57,720 --> 02:48:59,880
Does not win top 20.

4565
02:49:00,180 --> 02:49:01,280
Holy shit.

4566
02:49:02,360 --> 02:49:03,480
He's so fast.

4567
02:49:03,740 --> 02:49:05,380
I hope they don't win.

4568
02:49:07,560 --> 02:49:12,320
I hope they wasted their time and then get eliminated on day four.

4569
02:49:16,320 --> 02:49:22,120
I hope they get eliminated on day four because that's a cut off when the money stops.

4570
02:49:23,120 --> 02:49:25,940
When the money just starts going in.

4571
02:49:27,860 --> 02:49:29,620
That's all I care about.

4572
02:49:31,180 --> 02:49:32,500
That's so evil.

4573
02:49:32,500 --> 02:49:36,780
All those people that started my joker arc.

4574
02:49:38,980 --> 02:49:40,880
There's like two outside here.

4575
02:49:41,160 --> 02:49:43,540
So there should be two outside the other area.

4576
02:49:46,280 --> 02:49:47,740
It's not a waste.

4577
02:49:47,740 --> 02:49:48,480
It's exposure.

4578
02:49:49,580 --> 02:49:50,180
Yeah.

4579
02:49:50,340 --> 02:49:52,920
But it's not seventy thousand dollars.

4580
02:49:58,860 --> 02:50:00,240
You know what?

4581
02:50:00,380 --> 02:50:02,860
I hope one of them was just barely set.

4582
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:04,860
Like they get second place.

4583
02:50:05,780 --> 02:50:10,500
So they feel like shit that they didn't win first.

4584
02:50:12,600 --> 02:50:14,640
I already discovered that.

4585
02:50:15,160 --> 02:50:20,440
God that sucks when they barely missed out on the seventy K.

4586
02:50:21,140 --> 02:50:23,780
That's what they get for lying to me.

4587
02:50:24,800 --> 02:50:26,920
No it's like top 20.

4588
02:50:27,080 --> 02:50:30,440
So I think like first is seventy thousand.

4589
02:50:30,920 --> 02:50:31,980
Second is.

4590
02:50:32,080 --> 02:50:33,520
What is second again guys?

4591
02:50:33,800 --> 02:50:35,200
Do you guys know what second is?

4592
02:50:35,540 --> 02:50:36,760
Cause I don't remember.

4593
02:50:37,200 --> 02:50:40,620
I just know first is seventy K cause it's fucking seventy grand.

4594
02:50:41,380 --> 02:50:42,960
And then twelve K.

4595
02:50:43,060 --> 02:50:46,020
Okay second is like twelve grand.

4596
02:50:46,280 --> 02:50:51,780
And then third to twentieth is one K.

4597
02:50:51,860 --> 02:50:53,360
Wait Gumi found the last Easter egg?

4598
02:50:56,900 --> 02:50:57,940
Wait where's Gumi?

4599
02:50:58,560 --> 02:50:59,400
Where's Gumi?

4600
02:51:00,240 --> 02:51:01,100
Where is she?

4601
02:51:03,600 --> 02:51:04,760
Are you sure you're in?

4602
02:51:04,920 --> 02:51:06,120
Yes I'm 100% sure.

4603
02:51:06,580 --> 02:51:10,700
Because the person that I guilt tripped was lower points than me but they made it.

4604
02:51:11,380 --> 02:51:12,400
That's why I know.

4605
02:51:13,480 --> 02:51:14,460
Top right guys.

4606
02:51:15,500 --> 02:51:16,400
Which outside?

4607
02:51:17,120 --> 02:51:17,620
This outside?

4608
02:51:18,060 --> 02:51:18,820
The other outside?

4609
02:51:21,560 --> 02:51:22,760
It has to be this other.

4610
02:51:22,880 --> 02:51:23,940
Oh my god I love this guy's skin.

4611
02:51:24,680 --> 02:51:26,860
No I was so close to outside.

4612
02:51:28,920 --> 02:51:30,200
I was so close.

4613
02:51:30,360 --> 02:51:31,320
Oh wait that's not the outside.

4614
02:51:32,500 --> 02:51:32,940
Oh.

4615
02:51:33,040 --> 02:51:36,740
Oh I just saw Gumi too.

4616
02:51:38,360 --> 02:51:39,580
Oh it's the outside.

4617
02:51:40,040 --> 02:51:40,220
Okay.

4618
02:51:40,280 --> 02:51:41,600
Now we know where the TV is.

4619
02:51:42,220 --> 02:51:42,940
Okay.

4620
02:51:45,360 --> 02:51:46,080
Nice.

4621
02:51:46,500 --> 02:51:48,140
I'm gonna take the high ground.

4622
02:51:48,400 --> 02:51:50,500
Twitch says no outside.

4623
02:51:51,400 --> 02:51:53,620
Ask for coordinates.

4624
02:51:54,220 --> 02:51:55,800
Show your coordinates Doki.

4625
02:51:56,020 --> 02:51:57,380
Find the coordinates.

4626
02:51:58,120 --> 02:51:59,060
Yeah yeah.

4627
02:51:59,220 --> 02:51:59,940
Hey.

4628
02:52:02,500 --> 02:52:04,340
If you have a potato, do you have it at all?

4629
02:52:04,800 --> 02:52:05,680
No I didn't.

4630
02:52:06,260 --> 02:52:08,200
Can you say shout out to Fuzzy Snugs?

4631
02:52:08,200 --> 02:52:08,880
I just got lucky.

4632
02:52:09,020 --> 02:52:09,820
I don't even think you...

4633
02:52:09,820 --> 02:52:10,720
Shout out to who?

4634
02:52:12,480 --> 02:52:13,200
Fuzzy Snugs.

4635
02:52:13,260 --> 02:52:13,760
Can you say that?

4636
02:52:13,900 --> 02:52:14,600
Fuzzy Snugs?

4637
02:52:15,520 --> 02:52:16,320
Fuzzy like you know.

4638
02:52:17,380 --> 02:52:18,400
Yeah yeah yeah.

4639
02:52:18,520 --> 02:52:19,460
Okay what's in it for me?

4640
02:52:21,340 --> 02:52:22,500
What's in it for me?

4641
02:52:22,880 --> 02:52:24,400
You get to make somebody happy I guess.

4642
02:52:26,140 --> 02:52:27,360
Is this a cameo?

4643
02:52:28,700 --> 02:52:29,320
Yes yes.

4644
02:52:29,320 --> 02:52:30,360
I'm asking for a cameo.

4645
02:52:31,260 --> 02:52:31,720
Cameo?

4646
02:52:32,140 --> 02:52:35,760
Okay follow me on Twitter and I'll shout him out.

4647
02:52:39,460 --> 02:52:40,480
What's in it for me?

4648
02:52:42,500 --> 02:52:44,600
Wait I'm doing a favor for you.

4649
02:52:45,420 --> 02:52:46,900
I'm doing a favor for you.

4650
02:52:47,020 --> 02:52:48,700
There is no incentive for me.

4651
02:52:48,800 --> 02:52:50,240
I just said so very simply.

4652
02:52:50,460 --> 02:52:53,640
Somebody in my stream chat is a big fan.

4653
02:52:55,020 --> 02:52:56,940
Yeah and I'm doing you a favor.

4654
02:52:57,460 --> 02:52:58,340
Not me a favor.

4655
02:52:59,320 --> 02:53:00,240
I don't care what happens.

4656
02:53:00,460 --> 02:53:04,000
So you hate your chat.

4657
02:53:05,120 --> 02:53:06,240
Actually I do.

4658
02:53:06,480 --> 02:53:07,260
It's one click.

4659
02:53:07,960 --> 02:53:09,780
I definitely do hate my chat.

4660
02:53:09,860 --> 02:53:11,500
But you can't say two words.

4661
02:53:11,660 --> 02:53:13,960
Shout out Fuzzy Snugs.

4662
02:53:13,980 --> 02:53:15,860
Yeah yeah yeah.

4663
02:53:17,700 --> 02:53:18,760
That's in your chat.

4664
02:53:18,860 --> 02:53:19,660
That's not my chat.

4665
02:53:21,220 --> 02:53:22,480
That's not my chat.

4666
02:53:23,040 --> 02:53:24,800
Listen I don't know who you are.

4667
02:53:24,860 --> 02:53:25,860
But apparently they do.

4668
02:53:25,860 --> 02:53:27,800
So you know what's in it for me.

4669
02:53:28,160 --> 02:53:29,320
It's one click.

4670
02:53:29,440 --> 02:53:31,240
Oh you're not willing to do one click?

4671
02:53:31,840 --> 02:53:33,280
I don't do much things.

4672
02:53:34,700 --> 02:53:35,820
I never learn.

4673
02:53:36,620 --> 02:53:37,000
I'm not sick.

4674
02:53:38,320 --> 02:53:39,580
Damn that's fucked up.

4675
02:53:40,120 --> 02:53:41,480
He's not willing to...

4676
02:53:49,900 --> 02:53:50,860
My god.

4677
02:53:51,520 --> 02:53:52,000
Turkey.

4678
02:53:56,860 --> 02:53:58,860
Shout out to Snuggy.

4679
02:53:58,860 --> 02:54:00,440
This is Snuggy fans.

4680
02:54:00,880 --> 02:54:03,560
I'm on the rude one.

4681
02:54:03,560 --> 02:54:05,380
Why am I on the rude one.

4682
02:54:05,760 --> 02:54:08,280
They asked me for a shout out.

4683
02:54:08,380 --> 02:54:09,920
I was like alright one click.

4684
02:54:09,980 --> 02:54:11,240
Follow me on twitter.

4685
02:54:12,200 --> 02:54:16,220
Just one click, two words.

4686
02:54:16,520 --> 02:54:17,980
It's a good exchange.

4687
02:54:18,260 --> 02:54:20,140
I give you two words.

4688
02:54:21,240 --> 02:54:21,980
One click.

4689
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:22,000
Click!

4690
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:24,560

It's just business!

4696
02:54:39,020 --> 02:54:42,420
Yeah, you don't even have to stay follow!

4697
02:54:45,360 --> 02:54:52,600
Hey guys, if you're from SonicFox's chat, I would never do that to you.

4698
02:54:52,740 --> 02:54:54,500
I love my chat.

4699
02:54:57,860 --> 02:55:01,440
RedDragons, I will never do that to you guys.

4700
02:55:04,260 --> 02:55:05,240
Is that TV?

4701
02:55:08,240 --> 02:55:10,040
Is there a TV here?

4702
02:55:12,040 --> 02:55:13,840
Is there a TV here?

4703
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:21,440
Yeah.

4704
02:55:21,920 --> 02:55:22,520
Where is it?

4705
02:55:24,040 --> 02:55:25,160
I can't see!

4706
02:55:27,400 --> 02:55:28,620
Where is the TV?

4707
02:55:33,480 --> 02:55:33,920
Where?

4708
02:55:35,920 --> 02:55:36,360
Guys,

4709
02:55:39,420 --> 02:55:39,920
I need...

4710
02:55:40,840 --> 02:55:43,340
Guys, I need you guys to translate!

4711
02:55:43,700 --> 02:55:44,620
And the whole gang is over here!

4712
02:55:46,100 --> 02:55:47,960
Wait, go up here and just spam right click right here.

4713
02:55:48,180 --> 02:55:48,300
Yeah!

4714
02:55:48,300 --> 02:55:48,840
I'm gonna see it.

4715
02:55:48,840 --> 02:55:49,460
There it was!

4716
02:55:49,580 --> 02:55:50,320
Come on!

4717
02:55:50,620 --> 02:55:51,180
Come on!

4718
02:55:51,360 --> 02:55:52,580
Oh my god!

4719
02:55:52,720 --> 02:55:53,180
Where is it?

4720
02:55:53,520 --> 02:55:53,720
Finally!

4721
02:55:54,020 --> 02:55:54,820
That's crazy!

4722
02:55:55,200 --> 02:55:55,600
Wait!

4723
02:55:55,700 --> 02:55:56,140
I see it!

4724
02:55:56,320 --> 02:55:56,580
Yeah!

4725
02:55:56,840 --> 02:55:57,260
This is it!

4726
02:55:57,660 --> 02:55:58,500
Oh my god!

4727
02:55:58,700 --> 02:56:01,240
I followed the Minecrafters!

4728
02:56:02,340 --> 02:56:02,980
Translated!

4729
02:56:02,980 --> 02:56:03,640
We did it!

4730
02:56:03,680 --> 02:56:04,300
We got everything!

4731
02:56:04,800 --> 02:56:06,600
We got everything, guys!

4732
02:56:06,980 --> 02:56:08,340
We got everything!

4733
02:56:08,380 --> 02:56:09,420
Perfect game!

4734
02:56:09,920 --> 02:56:11,140
We did it!

4735
02:56:14,500 --> 02:56:16,240
Oh my god!

4736
02:56:16,240 --> 02:56:17,540
That one was hard!

4737
02:56:18,040 --> 02:56:18,540
Okay.

4738
02:56:18,620 --> 02:56:18,820
Oh my god!

4739
02:56:18,820 --> 02:56:19,940
It's across the way.

4740
02:56:20,020 --> 02:56:20,680
That one was fucking hard.

4741
02:56:20,740 --> 02:56:21,440
Alright, let me see.

4742
02:56:21,500 --> 02:56:22,080
I'm gonna check.

4743
02:56:22,080 --> 02:56:22,400
I need that one.

4744
02:56:22,620 --> 02:56:22,820
I need that one.

4745
02:56:22,820 --> 02:56:23,880
I'm gonna check if he followed.

4746
02:56:24,200 --> 02:56:24,540
What?

4747
02:56:24,640 --> 02:56:25,360
How did you not know?

4748
02:56:25,640 --> 02:56:26,440
I don't know.

4749
02:56:26,460 --> 02:56:27,100
I'm 9 out of 10.

4750
02:56:27,260 --> 02:56:29,360
This is important, guys!

4751
02:56:29,560 --> 02:56:30,480
We gotta know!

4752
02:56:32,540 --> 02:56:34,180
Let me see the ones outside of this.

4753
02:56:34,960 --> 02:56:36,920
There's one in three and then there's one in all of them.

4754
02:56:37,380 --> 02:56:38,540
They didn't follow!

4755
02:56:39,120 --> 02:56:39,520
No!

4756
02:56:41,440 --> 02:56:42,240
No shoutout!

4757
02:56:42,480 --> 02:56:43,480
No shoutout!

4758
02:56:43,800 --> 02:56:43,820
No shoutout!

4759
02:56:43,820 --> 02:56:44,360
No shoutout!

4760
02:56:44,560 --> 02:56:45,140
No shoutout!

4761
02:56:46,380 --> 02:56:47,180
No shoutout!

4762
02:56:48,860 --> 02:56:51,980
That was broadcast on the main Rylos channel?

4763
02:56:52,300 --> 02:56:54,940
Oh, the us all fucking bunching up?

4764
02:56:55,180 --> 02:56:57,960
That entire conversation?

4765
02:56:58,400 --> 02:56:59,100
Wait, really?

4766
02:57:00,960 --> 02:57:01,800
Wait!

4767
02:57:02,040 --> 02:57:04,740
That entire conversation I had?

4768
02:57:05,820 --> 02:57:08,240
No fucking way!

4769
02:57:09,200 --> 02:57:10,960
Oh my god!

4770
02:57:11,540 --> 02:57:13,840
I can't believe it!

4771
02:57:13,960 --> 02:57:15,200
There's no way!

4772
02:57:15,460 --> 02:57:15,980
No!

4773
02:57:16,060 --> 02:57:16,260
No!

4774
02:57:16,300 --> 02:57:17,120
No!

4775
02:57:17,180 --> 02:57:17,620
No.

4776
02:57:17,820 --> 02:57:20,460
Oh no, I got exposed!

4777
02:57:21,900 --> 02:57:23,360
I want the hair.

4778
02:57:24,140 --> 02:57:26,260
Damn, I got exposed.

4779
02:57:28,420 --> 02:57:30,120
Exposed to the world.

4780
02:57:30,860 --> 02:57:32,060
What do you mean?

4781
02:57:32,680 --> 02:57:33,080
they don't...

4782
02:57:33,080 --> 02:57:36,780
Zaifox literally said, they literally said, I hate my chat!

4783
02:57:37,100 --> 02:57:37,880
So I...

4784
02:57:37,880 --> 02:57:39,480
It caught them in 4K.

4785
02:57:39,740 --> 02:57:40,600
It caught...

4786
02:57:40,600 --> 02:57:42,780
They got caught up 4K!

4787
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:45,300
And I was like, whoa, I would never...

4788
02:57:50,040 --> 02:57:50,720
Oh, hey!

4789
02:57:51,460 --> 02:57:53,360
Are you ready to play Valorant?

4790
02:57:53,880 --> 02:57:54,320
Oh!

4791
02:57:54,740 --> 02:57:55,620
Oh yeah.

4792
02:57:56,040 --> 02:57:57,540
I almost forgot about that.

4793
02:57:58,360 --> 02:58:00,060
Yeah, you can never forget about it.

4794
02:58:00,360 --> 02:58:01,160
Wait, wait, wait.

4795
02:58:01,180 --> 02:58:04,280
I need to get lunch first and then I can play.

4796
02:58:04,420 --> 02:58:04,880
But I'll be playing.

4797
02:58:05,060 --> 02:58:06,000
I won't be streaming it though.

4798
02:58:06,220 --> 02:58:06,440
Okay.

4799
02:58:07,620 --> 02:58:09,320
You get lunch first and then we can play.

4800
02:58:09,500 --> 02:58:10,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4801
02:58:10,860 --> 02:58:12,120
Is it over yet?

4802
02:58:12,180 --> 02:58:13,220
Like, what are we waiting for?

4803
02:58:13,440 --> 02:58:14,260
Yeah, it's over.

4804
02:58:14,260 --> 02:58:15,260
Oh, okay.

4805
02:58:15,360 --> 02:58:17,440
Because they never said you're allowed to leave now.

4806
02:58:17,900 --> 02:58:19,400
I got all ten eggs.

4807
02:58:19,780 --> 02:58:20,400
Oh, me too.

4808
02:58:20,480 --> 02:58:21,060
I found it.

4809
02:58:21,060 --> 02:58:21,200
Yeah.

4810
02:58:21,980 --> 02:58:23,220
I found all ten.

4811
02:58:23,220 --> 02:58:24,100
You found it in the dark?

4812
02:58:24,700 --> 02:58:26,200
Yeah, the last one's at the dark.

4813
02:58:26,260 --> 02:58:27,320
Wait, how many do you have, Ant?

4814
02:58:27,980 --> 02:58:28,720
I have eight right now.

4815
02:58:31,940 --> 02:58:33,000
What the fuck?

4816
02:58:33,060 --> 02:58:34,180
You just started laughing.

4817
02:58:35,120 --> 02:58:36,760
That was a crazy laugh by the way.

4818
02:58:38,220 --> 02:58:39,180
Wait, what happened to us?

4819
02:58:39,360 --> 02:58:40,160
I have ten.

4820
02:58:40,300 --> 02:58:41,080
What happens now?

4821
02:58:41,280 --> 02:58:42,720
I don't think it's just nothing.

4822
02:58:44,500 --> 02:58:44,940
What?

4823
02:58:45,720 --> 02:58:48,800
By having ten, you get to laugh at people who don't have ten.

4824
02:58:48,940 --> 02:58:49,360
Like that.

4825
02:58:51,660 --> 02:58:52,940
Maybe we'll get that one.

4826
02:58:54,060 --> 02:58:56,600
There's one outside that's really fucked up.

4827
02:58:57,480 --> 02:58:58,480
Is it like in a tree?

4828
02:58:58,680 --> 02:58:59,520
Because I didn't get that one yet.

4829
02:58:59,520 --> 02:59:00,640
No, it's really fucked up.

4830
02:59:00,640 --> 02:59:01,900
It's really fucked up.

4831
02:59:02,180 --> 02:59:03,560
Alright, I'm gonna go grab lunch.

4832
02:59:03,580 --> 02:59:04,520
I'll see you later, Gumi.

4833
02:59:04,860 --> 02:59:06,040
DM me, DM me.

4834
02:59:06,060 --> 02:59:07,300
Alright, guys.

4835
02:59:07,620 --> 02:59:08,480
We made it, guys.

4836
02:59:09,260 --> 02:59:11,260
We made it to day two.

4837
02:59:11,480 --> 02:59:15,860
I can't believe my whole conversation was put up on stream.

4838
02:59:18,240 --> 02:59:19,980
We made it!

4839
02:59:20,020 --> 02:59:21,560
I had a great time.

4840
02:59:22,040 --> 02:59:25,560
A great time interacting with people I've interacted with before.

4841
02:59:26,860 --> 02:59:27,460
And...

4842
02:59:28,760 --> 02:59:29,960
How dare!

4843
02:59:30,520 --> 02:59:35,480
And like, I had a good time just talking to people and like... Okay, the first...

4844
02:59:37,260 --> 02:59:41,780
The first one... The first one was like really fucked up though.

4845
02:59:41,780 --> 02:59:45,420
I think the first game was super fucked up.

4846
02:59:45,500 --> 02:59:48,560
That one was messed up for me.

4847
02:59:48,700 --> 02:59:53,300
Like, I literally could not actually play the game and it took so long.

4848
02:59:53,600 --> 02:59:55,260
It took so long.

4849
02:59:56,220 --> 03:00:01,780
I could barely like take in anything that was going on in the first one.

4850
03:00:02,020 --> 03:00:05,340
And I felt like that should have been much shorter, 100%.

4851
03:00:05,340 --> 03:00:07,020
But the second one was fun.

4852
03:00:07,140 --> 03:00:08,300
The second game was really fun.

4853
03:00:08,380 --> 03:00:09,720
I think the best part was just interacting.

4854
03:00:09,720 --> 03:00:13,420
Nobody expected me to make it to the second game.

4855
03:00:13,820 --> 03:00:15,000
But we did it.

4856
03:00:15,360 --> 03:00:17,440
Yeah, I was running a goddamn marathon.

4857
03:00:18,080 --> 03:00:23,180
I was running a goddamn marathon in the first game.

4858
03:00:23,380 --> 03:00:25,720
And I was like, please, let this be over.

4859
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:27,160
And I was doing it wrong.

4860
03:00:27,840 --> 03:00:34,740
I was doing the marathon wrong too because I wasn't holding space because I didn't... I don't know the Minecraft tech.

4861
03:00:35,160 --> 03:00:36,500
The second game was fun.

4862
03:00:36,700 --> 03:00:38,000
I had a great time in the second game.

4863
03:00:38,780 --> 03:00:41,380
I still can't believe Mendo and Sleepy didn't make it through.

4864
03:00:41,460 --> 03:00:42,320
What the fuck?

4865
03:00:42,360 --> 03:00:43,420
They were so confident earlier.

4866
03:00:47,560 --> 03:00:49,360
Jokey bird was born today.

4867
03:00:50,240 --> 03:00:52,320
But yeah, I'll see you guys tomorrow.

4868
03:00:52,320 --> 03:00:53,780
I think it's the same time.

4869
03:00:56,620 --> 03:01:02,020
It's the same time and tomorrow and there's also two games.

4870
03:01:02,280 --> 03:01:03,860
So we'll see if we get eliminated.

4871
03:01:04,800 --> 03:01:07,080
But anyway guys, I'm gonna call it here.

4872
03:01:07,140 --> 03:01:11,720
I'll read Gumi since like I'll be showing up after lunch, after I get food.

4873
03:01:11,860 --> 03:01:15,340
But anyway guys, as always, everybody stay hydrated, posture check.

4874
03:01:15,760 --> 03:01:17,640
Get a bit more around to get that blood flowing.

4875
03:01:17,740 --> 03:01:19,840
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

4876
03:01:20,020 --> 03:01:21,680
Or I don't know, stay up for Valorant.

4877
03:01:22,480 --> 03:01:23,680
Cause you deserve it.

4878
03:01:23,780 --> 03:01:24,880
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

4879
03:01:25,340 --> 03:01:26,340
Oh shit, never mind.

4880
03:01:26,420 --> 03:01:27,120
Let's take a group picture.

4881
03:01:27,460 --> 03:01:27,820
JK.

4882
03:01:29,900 --> 03:01:30,260
JK.

4883
03:01:30,400 --> 03:01:31,680
I wanna be part of the group picture.

4884
03:01:31,960 --> 03:01:32,320
Exposure.

4885
03:01:34,740 --> 03:01:36,080
Wait, main stairs?

4886
03:01:36,220 --> 03:01:36,580
Okay.

4887
03:01:37,460 --> 03:01:38,640
Guys, we gotta get the exposure.

4888
03:01:38,760 --> 03:01:39,760
We made it to day one.

4889
03:01:40,520 --> 03:01:42,260
They're gonna post a picture screenshot.

4890
03:01:43,520 --> 03:01:46,880
Bro, the Minecraft streamers are gonna post a screenshot guys.

4891
03:01:48,540 --> 03:01:49,580
Pre-exposure.

4892
03:01:49,740 --> 03:01:50,040
Yeah!

4893
03:01:50,900 --> 03:01:53,060
I'll be the one that like awkwardly crouches in the front.

4894
03:01:53,060 --> 03:01:54,680
I'm gonna sorority crouch.

4895
03:01:55,440 --> 03:01:56,760
Yes, sorority crouch.

4896
03:01:57,460 --> 03:01:58,240
Sorority crouch.

4897
03:01:58,700 --> 03:02:01,960
Okay, the worst part is that I actually don't have a custom skin.

4898
03:02:02,620 --> 03:02:03,360
Wait, what's up?

4899
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:04,580
What's the...

4900
03:02:05,340 --> 03:02:10,840
Watch the button to show you guys what I'm What the fuck?

4901
03:02:11,500 --> 03:02:12,340
Is that bad?

4902
03:02:13,020 --> 03:02:15,680
Alright, this is my skin.

4903
03:02:18,360 --> 03:02:20,320
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

4904
03:02:22,140 --> 03:02:23,440
Check it out, check it out.

4905
03:02:23,500 --> 03:02:24,280
Check it out, check it out.

4906
03:02:26,040 --> 03:02:29,220
Picture, picture, picture.

4907
03:02:31,220 --> 03:02:32,880
Take a picture for me.

4908
03:02:32,980 --> 03:02:34,080
I'll be brown bear now.

4909
03:02:34,080 --> 03:02:35,120
When you do it, baby.

4910
03:02:35,360 --> 03:02:36,640
Photo, photo.

4911
03:02:36,700 --> 03:02:38,820
Photo, photo, photo.

4912
03:02:39,040 --> 03:02:41,000
I'm a fan, I'm a fan.

4913
03:02:41,000 --> 03:02:43,160
Say queso, say queso, queso.

4914
03:02:44,060 --> 03:02:44,620
Queso.

4915
03:02:45,420 --> 03:02:45,980
Queso.

4916
03:02:47,600 --> 03:02:48,720
Oh, I'm sorry.

4917
03:02:50,300 --> 03:02:50,860
Jigs.

4918
03:02:52,760 --> 03:02:53,760
Oh my god.

4919
03:02:54,520 --> 03:02:55,080
Jigs.

4920
03:02:56,460 --> 03:02:57,580
Holy shit.

4921
03:02:57,680 --> 03:02:58,560
That was so loud.

4922
03:02:58,880 --> 03:02:59,740
Yeah, sorry guys.

4923
03:03:00,140 --> 03:03:01,780
Sorry, guys, that was really loud.

4924
03:03:02,260 --> 03:03:05,400
I was like, when my look, I don't understand.

4925
03:03:08,160 --> 03:03:09,460
I looked away.

4926
03:03:09,580 --> 03:03:10,040
No!

4927
03:03:11,420 --> 03:03:12,760
I didn't know!

4928
03:03:15,360 --> 03:03:17,520
Yo, yo, can we disconnect now already?

4929
03:03:17,780 --> 03:03:18,600
This is me.

4930
03:03:18,920 --> 03:03:20,780
This is my my customs.

4931
03:03:22,020 --> 03:03:25,020
You can also get the skin just like this.

4932
03:03:25,420 --> 03:03:26,980
This is actually my OG skin.

4933
03:03:27,060 --> 03:03:28,200
I've had this skin for years.

4934
03:03:28,540 --> 03:03:35,060
I've had this skin since I had a Minecraft account.

4935
03:03:35,560 --> 03:03:37,840
So it's like actual OG.

4936
03:03:37,900 --> 03:03:39,300
It's not like I put it on.

4937
03:03:39,460 --> 03:03:42,460
It's not like I put this on like three, six months ago.

4938
03:03:42,560 --> 03:03:45,860
I actually had this skin like for the last five to six years.

4939
03:03:50,200 --> 03:03:51,860
I've always been a bear.

4940
03:03:52,720 --> 03:03:54,080
So I never changed it.

4941
03:03:55,500 --> 03:03:57,340
I've never changed this skin.

4942
03:03:58,200 --> 03:04:01,760
Just another just another skin suit.

4943
03:04:02,640 --> 03:04:09,620
If anyone wants to make a custom skin for me, it has to have the qualities of the bear skin.

4944
03:04:10,440 --> 03:04:12,880
It has to have parts of the bear skin, guys.

4945
03:04:13,060 --> 03:04:14,280
That's all I ask for.

4946
03:04:18,600 --> 03:04:22,200
It has to have some qualities of this, guys.

4947
03:04:22,300 --> 03:04:23,240
That's all I ask.

4948
03:04:24,620 --> 03:04:27,280
It's like, it's part of my lore.

4949
03:04:27,620 --> 03:04:28,860
I've always been a bear.

4950
03:04:29,960 --> 03:04:33,980
Before the skin suit, I had a bear skin suit.

4951
03:04:34,360 --> 03:04:36,180
But not in a furry type of way.

4952
03:04:38,340 --> 03:04:39,640
I'm just saying.

4953
03:04:39,920 --> 03:04:41,260
It was just in Minecraft.

4954
03:04:41,760 --> 03:04:42,740
Just in Minecraft.

4955
03:04:44,580 --> 03:04:46,080
Just in Minecraft, guys.

4956
03:04:46,420 --> 03:04:47,780
I just thought it was cute.

4957
03:04:47,920 --> 03:04:48,540
Just in Minecraft.

4958
03:04:49,020 --> 03:04:49,440
Alright, guys.

4959
03:04:49,520 --> 03:04:50,900
Now I'm actually at the go now, guys.

4960
03:04:51,100 --> 03:04:52,500
I'll see you guys later, everybody.

4961
03:04:53,120 --> 03:04:53,800
Bye, guys!

4962
03:04:54,740 --> 03:04:55,140
Bye!
