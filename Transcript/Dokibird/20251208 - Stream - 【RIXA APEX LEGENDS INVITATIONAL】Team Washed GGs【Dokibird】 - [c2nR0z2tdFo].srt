106
00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:01,430

apex that's insane it's like it's because monsoon and other

Why is he not confident in that acting?

117
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,270
It depends on like GG, nice wig on the team.

Like GG them, right?

119
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,290

Yeah, yeah.

121
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,550
People don't say GG, you have nice wig, right?

122
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:49,150
To us?

123
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:54,410
I mean, I think I might be the first person shittalked in
this chat when we go in that game.

124
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,870
Wait, is the lobby code out yet?

125
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,630
I don't know how lobby code works.

126
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:00,370
I don't know either.

127
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,670
I haven't done Battlefly in 18 years.

128
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:03,530

We probably will be, I think.

137
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:12,410
We'll just kind of find it.

138
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,430
No, no, it's fine.

139
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:14,310
We'll just be like...

00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,750
We're going to hide and seek with these codes.

141
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,490

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

156
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,780

Yeah, so let me tell you what you got on your team right
now, okay?

And that's it.

168
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:51,060
10k kills on each, but I have like less than 50 on
everything else.

169
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:52,460
Good.

170
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,460
Okay, that's good.

171
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,060
That's not bad, because Bangalore's low-key kind of meta
right now.

172
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:57,900
Kind of meta.

173
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:03,140
But all my kills are on my own stream snipers who would
punch me, so they had no guns.

174
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,460
Okay, so that's fine.

175
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:10,600
Okay, maybe one of them won't have guns on them, you know?

176
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,140
Maybe we'll get lucky.

177
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,100
I'm going to have to get some luck then today.

178
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,300
Zuni's in the sloppy.

179
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:17,960
Oh, we're fine.

180
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,540
No, it's okay.

181
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,140
They're not allowed to have kills.

182
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,160
It's okay.

183
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,460
They're like you.

184
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,480
No, they're not, though.

185
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,240
That's the problem.

186
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,660
If they get kills on us, it don't matter.

187
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,120
They get nothing out of it.

188
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,920
Yeah, I'm actually going to tell them not to do anything.

189
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,840
Zuni, disconnect.

190
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:41,680
All right.

191
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,900
So, Begalore, Begalore is like pretty good, I would say.

192
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:48,200
Begalore, Valc are probably must-haves in a lobby like this.

193
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:48,620
Okay.

194
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,340
Just because we want to rotate with a Valculte, she got like
a crazy buff, so she's stupid broken.

195
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,520
It just depends how you guys want to play.

196
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,380
Do you want to sweat it out?

197
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,540
Do you want to like go to the end game and like just chill
inside zone?

198
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,440
Do you want to run down people and just say, fuck it, who
cares?

199
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,180
It's up to you guys.

200
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,580
Well, on the last game, we have to run down people because
placement points don't matter on the last game.

201
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,360
It's all about Moxie's kills.

202
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,640
Okay, perfect.

203
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:18,660
to boxy then okay got it i mean we could experiment we have
six games of experimentation here yeah is that the only

204
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:24,820
rules though game six is the only one with rules like well
game one to five it's like it's me and moxie kills count but

205
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:32,900
there's also placement points okay got it so it's like lgs
minus me yeah minus you don't exist as a person not at all

206
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:41,000
yeah yeah you'll get them loads like yourself it's fine you
get one v3 get them low we'll be there yeah we'll be there

207
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:49,540
we'll wait for that's not going to be the situation where
you guys like walk in you're like oh my god they're all low

208

Die on point.

227
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,360
So I alter.

228
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,080
Oh, do you even know what alter does, Moxie?

229
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,520
I, I, uh, she has a teleporter.

230
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,480
She has like a portal through walls.

231
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:16,580
Okay.

232
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,320
That's it.

233
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,080
That's all I know.

234
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:18,660
That's all I know.

235
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:18,880
Yeah.

236
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,480
That's all I know.

237
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,220
Yep.

238
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,060
Teleporter through walls.

239
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,040
And then like her ulti is kind of like her ultimate.

240
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,140
It's like a, a nexus.

241
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,000
So you put it down and then she can recall you to it.

242
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:27,500
If you're not.

243
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,400
I just stay there.

244
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,620
And then send you guys out to die.

245
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,000
And then I'd bring you back.

246
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,500
You need to get in there.

247
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:40,820
your kills matter mine don't we need we need you okay if
that's the case you should be altered then i mean i can't if

248
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:45,660
you want me to you want me to be altered that no no because
i could not play valve for the life of me like i would

249
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:52,920
actually send us to die every time although i'll probably i
can see it every time somebody's not envision that happening

250
00:12:52,920 --> 00:13:05,380
i landed six people like two fucking teams instead that's
okay I believe in us all right so we're playing altar

251
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:19,040
Bangalore Valk right yes okay okay we're on storm point our
POI is the wall okay the wall that's not bad I'll find that

252
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,820
on the map somewhere yeah don't worry we're gonna lay there
automatically I think right we're just gonna drop over there

253
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:32,000
get the downstairs from the wall because no one's there no
one got that pli part oh really okay then yeah i'll land

254
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:40,560
there and go yeah but there are teams surrounding that area
so do well are people like saying where they're dropping no

255
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:51,080
no no so now now in okay so pli was a okay moxie pli's now
signed so i love this uh so they added a new update so

256
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:58,940
there's no like jump leader anymore there's no jump master
so we just automatically land in the poi wow okay i thought

257
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:05,420
it was like some some type of aura stuff like whoa whoa whoa
a dokey nice way moxie's landing the wall like do not drop

258
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:11,160
there like i thought it was like everyone is like yeah we're
just like don't land there that's where we're landing also

259
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:19,320
they fucked up the team numbers like now did they forgot how
to count did they forgot like a number like what happened

260
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:27,040
this is at 20 our people are leaving no they're all going to
unassigned because they're all so i guess they missed the

261
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:35,220
number or some shit so we're on supposed to be number six so
i'm just waiting team one is the i got removed from the

262
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:43,860
match that's fine yeah they don't talk about us did we get
banned already well that was fun i can't believe it they

263
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:50,640
wait what oh yeah did you guys see the rule rule page it was
like apparently okay i didn't read the rules page my manager

264
00:14:50,640 --> 00:15:01,180
read it and it was like 15 is long and i was like oh whoa
yeah we need chat chibi to put that in the summer yeah yeah

265
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:09,640
can you summarize this into one piece look he's so clutch
for that account i thought i used ai never remember you know

266
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:20,290
yeah yeah never never never never you're the reason why ram
prices are so high now it's your fault wig yeah 100 percent

267
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:33,220
thousand dollars for two gigabytes of ramp first place is 12
points okay so second is 9 37 fourth is fifth fifth is four

268
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:40,360
okay so we only get a point for going 15 or higher i get
should we get kills like is this like nice way you recognize

269
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:46,980
these a lot of these like players you think we could just
run them down you gotta be dopey on the team i think overall

270
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:53,340
average of like skill level i think say that confident.

271
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,600
You're so confident of your own skill of no, I'm talking
about mainly about you guys.

272
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,200
Oh, but super, you're so confident of us too.

273
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,480
And I'm like comparing you two to the other two.

274
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,100
Like, you know what I mean?

275
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,600
I think we're good.

276
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,060
But the main thing is kills will be great.

277
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,200
But like, I gotta, you know, make sure I don't die, but also
not get the kills in certain situations.

278
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,800
And that's kind of hard to do.

279
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:14,420
You know what I mean?

280
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:15,400
Yeah.

281
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,180
Well, if anyone can do it, it's you, though.

282
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,120
Yeah, I believe in you.

283
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:19,420
You can suppress that.

284
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:27,580
I think there's two more people that could definitely sure
so we'll get at least third place then that's good yeah yeah

285
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:32,820
at least third place also like if you start if you feel like
you're about to kill someone just unplug your controller

286
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:41,260
like that yeah yeah I'm on a MK now oh you're what I
switched up wait wait I don't like that you don't like that

287
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:50,520
wait why would you do that to yourself why dude every game
is so much more fun dude wait what the fuck you guys don't

288
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:59,440
like my my skill level without aim assist i mean so i'm just
look the immediate switch up was diabolical uh you know okay

289
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:09,560
so there's a key word there aim assist and you know i'm
stealing every kill tonight now every so until i can i would

290
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:17,360
like some assist yeah i would like some assist with my aim
like why would that let's take that away from yourself yeah

291
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,980
it's just listen Cross like what am I gonna do play Marvel
rivals on controller like it's just not it.

292
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:30,380
It's not it people do it Yeah, some people do it the one of
the best controller players is a controller player Yeah, he

293
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:30,980
was on a hundred thieves.

294
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:38,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, so like you can do it You just gotta
try harder Dude, I'm not good enough no more man the hands

295
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,600
don't work like that.

296
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,540
You know what I'm saying?

297
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:47,280
I feel like it like controller playing is like max wind
comfortable like you get to lean back You could stand up and

298
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,660
like exactly, you know, like it's It sounds like I'm
jealous.

299
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:55,540
You get to slouch and play the game and still do it all
because you got the aim assist.

300
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,040
You got the skills.

301
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:58,860
Oh, fuck this, man.

302
00:17:59,120 --> 00:17:59,720
Listen, dude.

303
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,320
Come on, wig.

304
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,200
Come on.

00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:02,540
Plug in that.

306
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,200
Apex people knowing aim assist OP.

307
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,000
Exactly.

308
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,820
You hear me read that comment out?

309
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,780
Yeah, you guys know it's OP.

It is, dude.

311
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,140
But like, listen, the MK is just too comfy.

312
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:11,940
I like it more.

313
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,940
You know, my back hurts less for some reason.

314
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,340
I'm reaching 30 now.

315
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,920
I got to keep my motor skills going.

316
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,340
It just locks in.

317
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,020
It's nice.

318
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,300

Okay.

322
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:33,980
You know, I relied a lot on wig being on aim assist just to
find out he's not on aim.

323
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,920
Doki, you said we had this in the back.

324
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,640
Like, nice to go on the roller.

325
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,460
How was I supposed to know he swapped inputs?

326
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:41,700
That's me.

327
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,560
You know, I'm here yesterday.

328
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,400
I'm writing this call.

329
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,080
I thought you were saying something.

330
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:46,540
Yeah, I thought we had something about soon.

331
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,940

336
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:52,180

338
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:55,640

340
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,160

One second.

343
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,180
I didn't think he would just swap inputs.

344
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,480
He's been on controller for like four years.

345
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,280
And now he's on FNC.

346
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,000
Like, I'm not familiar with the pro scene.

347
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,420
He's talking a lot about this monsoon guy.

348
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,580
Is he like a pro winner tournament?

349

00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:40,360
people over there i see guys one guns are good oh we should
have talked about nine and g7 scout i heard are good you got

481
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:50,080
it r9 g7 scout oh re45 is not bad yeah re45 is an energy gun
right now uh it is that's a little burst a little burst

482
00:27:50,080 --> 00:28:00,420
weapon not bad guys so is double mosaic still good oh yeah
you can rock that right now for sure 100 okay i'll be asking

483
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:08,400
a lot of these guns i should have like figured i should have
like landed here before my game before the tournament i'm

484
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,040
just like where is everything

485
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,960
star if you want to oh dude that sounds like everything can
i can run yeah i mean if you want there's not really that

486
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:24,800
many bad guns right now it's kind of the there are like the
best guns for sure yeah there's definitely like the best

487
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:35,240
weapons to use they're not about it but there's a g7 are she
is she seven again or nah oh there's two phoenixes here g7 i

488
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:42,020
thought that was pretty you can run the g7 that's good g7 is
better than like majority of other guns right now That's not

489
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,240
your best bet.

490
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,940
Alternator's not bad if you get the double tap perk.

491
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,200
There's a repeater here.

492
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,200
Is the repeater good?

493
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:48,700
Peter's good?

494
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,040
Yeah.

495
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,600
I feel like every gun I ask and just say it's good.

496
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,620
I'm putting R9s.

497
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,320
I'm putting R9s.

498
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,800
R9s, fantastic.

499
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,320
Okay, R9 is the best one.

500
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,300
Oh god, I got a hop up.

501
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,580
I got the hop up thing.

502
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,120
I have a mag if you have an R9.

503
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,620
Just let me know.

504
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,460
Yep, I got an R99.

505
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:08,660
And I got a mag.

506
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,040
Amazing.

507
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,280
Oh, you're killing it.

508
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:19,980
I'm like having less and less confidence with WIG because
he's like every gun we've said you're like yeah, that's good

509
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:28,440
That's a good gun like is there no bad guns like I mean like
if you're taking like R301 like R301 I'm gonna say drop that

510
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,340
shit for sure.

511
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,240
What about a flat line?

512
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:36,860
I would say probably not the flat line flat line greater
than L star Yes, yes, sadly, I would say so.

513
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:37,680
Oh, no

514
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:47,260
if you want that too there's a barrel stabilizer here okay i
ping the purple backpack if you guys don't have a purple

515
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:57,840
it's all the way over here the barrel stabilizers don't even
fit on the r99 anymore no it's a laser sight now yeah oh

516
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:06,420
we're getting there we go we're doing it we're doing i think
the easiest question is like what gun is not good um i mean

517
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:13,000
again like all three ones pretty bad for sure okay i'm flat
knight r99 i'm sticking with them All right, I'm taking, I'm

518
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,820
doing double light.

519
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,100
This might be the worst decision of my life, but I'm going
double light.

520
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,880
Low keep can be a good one, though.

521
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:19,940
I'm not gonna lie.

522
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,780
Craft it whatever you need to, if you need like extra
battery or something.

523
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:23,760
All right, wait, where do we go?

524
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,760
Where do you think, you've watched so many of these games.

525
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,500
Where do you think it's end zone?

526
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,600
We need evos, no?

527
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:30,740
We need me.

528
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,320
Moxie, can you open this assault pin over here?

529
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,000
This little red bin over here?

530
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:35,860
Okay, yeah, I'm coming.

531
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,020
Yeah, come open that bad boy up.

532
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,220
I did not think I'd be this bad.

533
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:48,880
purple backpack and guess you're still on white i'm a little
worried oh no we're fine all right we got blue don't you

534
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:55,720
can't you upgrade to uh i can ring our survey what do you
want you definitely need to do the console ring for sure

535
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:02,680
okay wait we're gonna find a spot to go hit that bad boy i
might get hit it right now listen no that's not a survey oh

536
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:08,320
never mind i can't hit that right now we're gonna go to city
hall we're gonna go to city hall what is my upgrade is the

537
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:17,600
smoke one you could do that what's the other one again uh
damage to enemy alt and destroys enemy tack so that one's

538
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:23,460
better in the late game if you want to be more selfish you
choose the hp regen if you want to do a team playing style

539
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:31,100
then you probably do the other one for sure yeah are you a
team player can you just tell the pro here yeah pick that

540
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:41,540
pick the non-selfish one asshole how about that one dude

Oh, it's too late.

556
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,360
It's too late.

557
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,180
It's too late.

558
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:32,820
Yeah, too late.

559
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,180
Chad, why the fuck would you tell him that, man?

560
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:34,540
Yeah.

561
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,780
Why didn't you tell him like, like in the, in the past?

562
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:37,680
Oh.

563
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,240
You should predict the future.

564
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,100
All right.

565
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:45,240
We're going to go and hit this little survey beacon inside
Erdeg.

566
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,920
I'm lagging my ass off.

567
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,520
So this is a horrible start for us.

568
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,240
Plug in your controller.

569
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,740
The aim assist can't be lagged.

570
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,140
You can't lag when you have aim assist.

571
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,240
She's right.

572
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,300
She's right.

573
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:57,900
Yeah, I'm right.

574
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,380
I'm just making excuses.

575
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,080
I'm not even lagging, man.

576
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,140
Wait, okay, we're left.

577
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:02,620
We're good.

578
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:04,740
I don't know where they are.

579
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,100
We're fine.

580
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:05,680
I'm going to hit this beacon.

581
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:06,660
We can just operate that way.

582
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:07,520
Yeah, we're fine.

583
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,700
Oh, there's a team in front.

584
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,360
There's a team in front.

585
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:12,960
There's a team right here.

586
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:13,780
Yeah, come back to me.

587
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,260
Come back to me.

588
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,620
Come this way to me.

589
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,740
We're going to navigate backwards.

590
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,360
Just keep up and right.

591
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,020
I fell down.

592
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,160
Yeah, we're good.

593
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:21,380
We're good.

594
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,180
We're good.

595
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:22,820
We're so safe.

596
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:23,560
We're so safe.

597
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,180
We're going to keep dodging all the bullshit, dude.

598
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:26,420
Okay.

599
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:32,280
so they're saying upgrade is they're talking about this oh i
just lagged out no we're good no no you're good you're good

you're good oh no no you're good you're still moving on my
screen all right come to me we're gonna ult you can be there

601
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:44,280
to zone okay there we go we're gonna get a little bit deeper
we're gonna land safe and we're gonna wait for another ulti

602
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:50,700
okay that's what we're gonna do i believe i should be able
to scan everybody here i'm lagging crazy so my fight's not

603
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:59,660
bad there's no scans going up oh they're they're here yep oh
there's a team here here for showing right here yep just get

604
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:05,040

right here we're gonna wait for there could be on our right

605
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,500
right now so here on the right side they are here they are
here i hit one for 108.

oh i hit one for not we're good you're good you're good
you're good i'm okay i had nothing oh no you don't worry all

607
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,260
good everything is flat I feel like a play far away.

608
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:22,680
Oh, yeah.

609
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,400
No, far away is definitely not.

610
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:24,880
Definitely not.

611
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,820
Flat line far away?

612
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,900
Um, I would say so.

613
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:28,100
Maybe.

614
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:28,500
Yeah.

615
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,460
Fall line far away is not bad.

616
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,220
Cover in our backs just in case.

617
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:31,820
Yeah, look that way.

618
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,180
Look that way.

619
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,100
I'm looking that way.

620
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,460
Should I get a hemlock instead?

621
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,720
I mean, if you want to, flat lines are a little bit better
than hemlock for sure.

622
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:38,960
I think we're going to go to the right side.

623
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:39,460
He's just there.

624
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:39,720
We're good.

625
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:39,920
We're good.

626
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:40,380
We're chilling.

00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:21,620
I don't know.

640
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:21,940
I don't know.

641
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:22,600
I'm lagging so bad.

642
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,220
This is nuts.

643
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,380
I wonder if anyone else is lagging.

644
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,140
Just a me thing.

645
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,000
Oh, I hope it's not.

646
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:29,760
I hope someone.

647
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,580
I hope a team dies.

648
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,400
So we're not last.

649
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,820
So then I'll be okay with dying.

650
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,580
That's actually so true.

651
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,400
Fuck me, man.

652
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,500
Someone please fucking die.

653
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,000
This team died.

654
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:42,720
It's not me.

655
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,020
All right, guys.

656
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,260
Come over here to me real quick.

657
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,000
Come crawl through this little crouch area.

658
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:48,660
We're good.

659
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,940
We're gonna go to this building over here.

660
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,300
All right.

661
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,720
Why do I have a, why do I get movement speed?

662
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,560
Oh, it's a, it's a speed booster mantle boosting.

663
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,160
There you go.

664
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,300
Or if you're actually looking at us.

665
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:00,680
What?

666
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:01,200
Mantis boost.

667
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,220
There's a blue backpack here.

668
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,560
You pick it up.

669
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,100
Yeah, you get that blue.

670
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:06,820
I saw you.

671
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:07,120
All you.

672
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:07,420
Yep.

673
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,060
Got it.

674
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,100
Vibin.

675
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,080
Gray comms.

676
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,040
Okay, I'm, I'm chilling.

677
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,320
I'm so chill right now.

678
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,780
We're gonna wait for this zone to close and we're gonna find
out where we're going here, too.

679
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,560
I feel so chill.

680
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,400
I'm looking behind us to see anyone else's.

681
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,040
Oh, they're...

682
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:20,600
Yeah, they're moving up.

683
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:20,980
Chris, we're good.

684
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:22,820
Yeah, we're good.

685
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,080
All right.

686
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,540
You guys stay there and keep shooting those guys.

687
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,020
Okay.

688
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,620
I didn't shoot any shots.

689
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,380
Yeah, if you want to, go for it.

690
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:31,920
Up to you.

691
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,220
We're going to wait for the zone to close.

692
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,380
Oh, I thought I was trying to, I was trying to peek out my
window.

693
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,360
Oh, you gave them cover?

694
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,220
You gave them cover?

695
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:38,860
That's good.

696
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,020
Yeah, move to me.

697
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,020
Move to me real quick.

698
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:41,600
Come on.

699
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:42,160
Okay, okay.

700
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:42,760
Yeah, you're good.

701
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,400
That's good.

702
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,040
That's good.

703
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,160
You're chilling.

704
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,160
We're gonna go in this building right here.

705
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,200
We're good to go.

706
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,200
I'm not lagged out.

707
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:53,900
Never mind, I'm still here.

708
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:54,520
No, you're still here.

709
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,060
You're still here.

710
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:55,900
I see you moving.

711
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:56,360
We're fine.

712
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,520
I don't know why I'm lagging so much, but shout out to 100
of these compound.

713
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:00,280
You guys are sick.

714
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,260
I'm gonna hit this beacon real quick once again.

715
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,020
We're making a risky play.

716
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:05,820
All right, we're good.

717
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,980
Move up to this next one for me.

718
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,400
Get over here to this next one.

719
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,400
We're going to top four.

720
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,220
Top four big building.

721
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:12,740
Yep, yep.

722
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,240
I'm on my way.

723
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:14,960
Follow me.

724
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,140
Yes, sir.

725
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,420
Follow me.

726
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,700
It's still 20 teams.

727
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:19,960
What's three?

728
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,400
What's three?

729
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,760
Yeah, a lot of teams alive.

730
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,480
A little scary.

731
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,980
A little scary there.

732
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,320
Just a little bit.

733
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,400
A little nerve wracking, but we should be fine.

734
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,200
We're going to Valco D again when you guys get up here.

735
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:29,840
I'm here.

736
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:30,600
We're both here.

737
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:31,060
All right.

738
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:31,880
I'm lagging again.

739
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:32,860
We're good.

740
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,060
I'm trying to do my...

741
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,300
Moxie, Moxie, get over here.

742
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:35,820
Get over here.

743
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,600
Bro, you get shot.

744
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:37,980
We're good.

745
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:39,780
We're good.

746
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,060
We're good.

747
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:40,480
We're good.

748
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,480
All right.

749
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,260
Stay on with me.

750
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:42,940
Don't go anywhere.

751
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:43,740
Okay.

752
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,320
Oh, okay.

753
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,360
There's a team over there.

754
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,640
I'm lagging horribly.

755
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,520
Oh, my God.

756
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,260
I'm lagging everywhere.

757
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,320
I'm lagging everywhere.

758
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,880
I have no idea what I'm doing.

759
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:57,520
We're good.

760
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:57,860
We're good.

761
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:58,420
We're good.

762
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:58,800
Stay here.

763
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:00,420
Stay here.

764
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:00,800
Stay here.

765
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:01,060
Stay here.

766
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:01,760
Come here.

767
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,120
Come here.

768
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:02,400
Come here.

769
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:07,520
Right on my spot.

770
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:07,840
My spot.

771
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,440
That's definitely monsoon.

772
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,560
That's definitely monsoon.

773
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,860
This is not a bad spot.

774
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,100
We just need to play small.

775
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:14,680
Smoke when we can and we're good to go.

776
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,320
Yeah, yeah.

777
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,080
Beautiful.

778
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,120
Why the fuck am I lagging so much?

779
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:22,020
Yeah, no, you know, when I was like, I have a feeling.

780
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:23,960
We're good.

781
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:24,220
We're good.

782
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:24,980
We're good.

783
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,360
Okay, okay.

784
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:25,640
We're good.

785
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:26,360
We're good.

786
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:26,520
We're good.

787
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:28,200
We're good.

788
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,620
You guys better say something than nothing.

789
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:33,740
You know what I had?

790
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:36,960
I was like, how the fuck are there 20 teams alive, bro?

791
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,360
What the fuck is going on?

792
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:39,640
Everyone.

793
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,300
Everyone's trying to play zone.

794
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,380
Should I open up this assault bin?

795
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,540
If you want to, don't go.

796
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:48,300
and then open it.

797
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,280
Yup, yup, yup.

798
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,280
I'm lagging again.

799
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,860
Oh my god.

800
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:52,580
Oh.

801
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,780
Put someone on me close.

802
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right about us.

803
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:57,500
We're good.

804
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:58,520
I'm looking at them.

805
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,020
We're showing.

806
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:00,880
Alright, stay here real quick.

807
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,080
I need you to some recon real fast.

808
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:02,900
You guys stay here.

809
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,700
Okay, just don't lag while you're reconning.

810
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,500
Just don't lag when you're reconning.

811
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,360
Wait, we're not last.

812
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,800
Guys, guys, we're not last.

813
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,080
We can die.

814
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:10,460
No, we're good.

815
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:10,780
We're good.

816
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:10,860
We're good.

817
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,480
I'm lagging so bad.

818
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,680
This is fucking insane.

819
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:15,500
What has happened?

820
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:15,900
Oh, Smokey G.

821
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,940
I get my Valkaldi back.

822
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,360
This could be very good for us.

823
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,580
Could be very good.

824
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,420
I'm trying to see if I can poke.

825
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,600
There's like a fight right here.

826
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:35,140
Okay, what we're going to do here is we're going to, when I
get Valkaldi back, which I should, we're going to smoke the

827
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,460
height building and then we're going to Valkaldi block their
LOS.

828
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:40,500
Okay, so yeah, Moxie, the smoke, it depends on you.

829
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,900
Okay, well, say again, say you smoke one.

830
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,920
I'm top here when I tell you to.

831
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:45,380
On that.

832
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,440
Okay, on top of there.

833
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,640
What do I tell you?

834
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,100
No, you will.

835
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:49,480
You will.

836
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,120
We were good though.

837
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:50,440
Not yet.

838
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:50,740
Not yet.

839
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,080
How long did my smoke last?

840
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:56,940
Five seconds.

841
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:57,320
You'll be good.

842
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:57,660
You'll be good.

843
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:58,740
I'll tell you what.

844
00:40:59,160 --> 00:40:59,560
Don't stress it.

845
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,020
You're good.

846
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:00,400
Okay.

847
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,380
There is a team below us right here.

848
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:03,520
Yes.

849
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,700
There should be a lot of teams dying here.

850
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,660
When do I bangles?

851
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,620
I'll tell you when as well.

852
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,120
Not yet.

853
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,520
On her right, we're good.

854
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,660
People are moving up on us kind of.

855
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,020
We're fine.

856
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:13,800
Underneath us as well.

857
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:14,360
We're good.

858
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:15,320
We're good.

859
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:16,840
All right.

860
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

861
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,340
Super slow.

862
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:22,620
Nice, nice.

863
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:23,760
All right.

864
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,100
I think you missed it.

865
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:25,360
All good.

866
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,260
Come here, come here, here.

867
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:28,460
Oh, yeah.

868
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,220
No worries.

869
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,040
Okay, we have really nowhere to go.

870
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:37,760
Oh, so we're just going.

871
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,600
This is really bad.

872
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:39,580
Bottom up?

873
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,260
You're right here.

874
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:40,360
Go here.

875
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,200
Yeah, here, here, here, here.

00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:42,860
All right, here we go.

877
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:43,400
How do we fight?

878
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,620
Smok, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke.

879
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,380
Oh shit, it's bad.

880
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,460
Oh, this is so bad.

881
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:49,280
This is so bad.

882
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:49,440
This is so bad.

883
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,300
Everyone's fighting us.

884
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:51,640
Keep moving.

885
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:52,540
He's smoking.

886
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,120
He's doing what he can.

887
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:53,940
Nice.

888
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:54,760

00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,020
Right in front of us.

893
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:03,620
Can knocks.

894
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:05,800
We're good.

895
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:07,700

896
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:08,380
I thirsted him.

907
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,820
Okay, I'm feeling it.

908
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:21,580
I feel like we're good though.

909
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:22,160
I can feel we're good.

910
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:22,860
I can hold it.

911
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:23,800
Yeah, hold it.

912
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,220
Just hold it until we get shot at and then like pray.

913
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,440
Yeah, late game, late game.

914
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:29,560
We're going, we're going here.

915
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:30,060
Late game.

916
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:30,660
We're going to the other side.

917
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,420

00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,640
I didn't get the full.

925
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,300

00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,880
We got one point.

929
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:43,320
Nice.

930
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,060
Big points.

931
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,620

932
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,120

Great job.

934
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:48,040
Okay.

935
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:48,900

00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:49,760
Oh, wait, I got most...

937
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:49,880
Oh, wait.

938
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,640
I'm gonna shake that, actually.

939
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:52,860
Wait, can I finish this?

940
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,540
Like, can I finish people off or down?

941
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:55,180
Did I get the kill?

942
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:56,240
No, no.

943
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,400
Only if you knock them, but it doesn't matter.

944
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,260
I think you still do it.

945
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:58,920
You still do it regardless.

946
00:42:59,520 --> 00:42:59,740
Okay.

947
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:01,440
There's a double.

948
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,040
This is her.

949
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:03,880

Yeah, this is...

953
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,300
I'm a little scared.

954
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,280
No, late game, we're gonna...

955
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:11,540
We're gonna...

956
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:11,860
Oh, my God!

966
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:22,000

1013
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:54,480

00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:58,060
I couldn't.

1018
00:44:58,740 --> 00:44:59,420
It's okay, it's okay.

1019
00:44:59,440 --> 00:44:59,740
It's okay.

1020
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:00,540
I'm so healthy.

1021
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,320
I'm a smallcy honest.

1022
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:02,900
Hipsy, hop, hop, hop, hop.

1023
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,140

90, 90.

1025
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:06,840
It's okay.

1026
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:10,840
So you could maybe potentially...

1027
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,200
Give me shield, give me shield.

1028
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,100

00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:14,960
He's right on your windows.

1030
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:15,660
I'm so dead.

1031
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:16,220

1032
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,080
Mother suckers.

1033
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,480
What the fuck?

1034
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:25,280
All I'm saying is that you falconed me into the zone when I
was one.

1035
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,440
Dude, I was lagging.

1036
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:28,720
Guys.

1037
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,040
Guys.

1038
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:31,520
Yeah.

1039
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,100
Did they send the right code?

1040
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,920
I feel like I'm in the ALGS here.

1041
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,680
What the fuck was that?

1042
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:49,680
why were there so many teams alive look yes i all i'm seeing
is i could have lived no all i'm saying is the fact that we

1043
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:59,600
just got top 10 with no defensive character and that was
ridiculous that was nuts that was crazy unreal holy fuck me

1044
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:08,800
that was awesome great game we got top 10 and a kill dude
that was good yeah yeah we got one no point we got two

1045
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:16,480
points i think two points that's not bad at all yeah yeah
okay so and 50 was just you dokey yeah exactly i got the 50

1046
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:24,980
of those points and then the rest was a team effort yep
exactly what that was yeah that's all one man there's

1047
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:31,460
straight team efforts i feel like we do eight shots office
what the is going on with this we should just run at a team

1048
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:37,020
not gonna lie no i mean we probably should next time i think
we're better than majority the squad yeah let's just run out

1049
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:43,860
of team yeah we got these people i think so too i think we
can do it yeah we can do it i don't want to fight in this

1050
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:51,000
tiny ass zone dude fuck those fucking stanky fucking costly
players too man yeah isn't it costing why am i not lagging

1051
00:46:51,000 --> 00:47:07,330
watching what is going on oh yeah my bad i didn't tell you
to bang all that's my fault oh yeah he never banged oh yeah

1052
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:13,110
We could have had a bang on Could have had a bang on people
for sure 100% totally try to tell you to do that zombie I

1053
00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:19,670
feel like ulti doesn't work for this No, not really I mean
if we're gonna run at people it'll work We just need to run

1054
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:25,790
at people Yeah, maybe Yeah We need a good job though Like I
can't move we say a lot for so long Yeah, we did I didn't

1055
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:32,010
know when to use the queue Cause I feel like if we queue I
would we would die Whoa, I should have ulted the bus, huh?

1056
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:37,110
Yeah, probably Yeah It's all good I should have told you to
do that I should have told you to do that to be fair No

1057
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:45,670
worries you know what I'm gonna use use stuff without you
having to say it I like that my own thinking I kind of like

1058
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:53,550
that out of you I think you should do that I'll trust you I
trust you entirely oh sort of maybe I used it under to the

1059
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:59,350
bridge when we got shot at maybe no cuz it wouldn't hit them
anyway cuz the bridge is bridge I think maybe you should

1060
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:11,140
restart your game too I don't know if I'm thinking yeah
let's say it was I'm gonna ask that real quick I mean,

1061
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:12,700
people, some people are restarting, I think.

1062
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:15,420
Oh, wait, I think every, yeah, everyone was lagging.

1063
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:16,320
Okay, okay, cool.

1064
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,700
What I say, man, hard to be a really good runner.

1065
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:19,460
Or pingy.

1066
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:19,840

Okay, okay.

1069
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:27,280
I'm going to restart the game regardless, though, real
quick.

1070
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:28,020
Oh, yeah.

1071
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:28,780

1082
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:31,500
bad server create entertainment I feel like Loki we could
just run at some squads yeah I think let's do it let's do it

on man bad valve by the way no so I don't know what you're

1085
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:57,840
gonna play i mean rife maybe portals is valke even that
broken i mean i mean all the rotations we got was because of

1086
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:06,480
valke did she just see what she just did for us dude oh yeah
well i don't know the value of that it just looked like i

1087
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:14,340
was going on the trip oh yeah we're on like worldwide all
right here's the new lobby code

1088
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:33,710
we're back oh yeah we are I was like, Valc is also the
reason why you died in the zone, to be fair.

1089
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:34,770
Yeah, that is true.

1090
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:36,250
I would agree with that.

1091
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:38,970
Valc did take me to my death.

1092
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:41,110
Do people not run Gibby anymore?

1093
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:42,350
No.

1094
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:43,650
Okay.

1095
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:45,130
No.

1096
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:47,430
I think it's because there's Newcastle's just better.

1097
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:48,730
Oh,

1098
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:53,750

Hey, listen.

1100
00:50:56,170 --> 00:50:58,090
Top 10 for us was very surprising there.

Yeah, me too.

1102
00:50:58,750 --> 00:50:59,550

You know what?

1104
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:01,090

1107
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:29,140
like the the plane crash documentary series uh all right All
right, I'm loading back in now.

1108
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:29,960
Hopefully this won't work.

1109
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,220
Okay, I got worried because I thought you were lagging.

1110
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,340
Sounded like you were lagging.

1111
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:36,020

1133
00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:05,800
the the gold weighs too much or like oh maybe he's oh maybe
he's investing in the gold you know he's waiting to the gold

1134
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:15,220
value shots up so then he can melt it so that's why he
leaves in his office that he doesn't go to yeah it's a

1135
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:22,100
long-term gain instead of like a safe or a vault yeah he
heard the ramsticks are going up and you know what ramsticks

1136
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:28,940
need cold yeah well you're thinking you're thinking here
Yeah, I'm thinking there.

1137
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:38,290
So what are you going to play now, Wig?

1138
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:40,550
We're going to run at people.

1139
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:44,360
Uh-oh.

1140
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:45,060
Wig?

1141
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,940
I think he stands up to go touch some gold.

1142
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:48,680
Oh, yeah.

1143
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:50,860
Maybe he's trying to steal the gold right now.

1144
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:53,060
Something like that.

1145
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:54,120
Okay.

1146
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:54,700
This is, okay.

1147
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,280
I honestly think like, yeah.

1148
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,260
Like, I feel like we did get unlucky positioning.

1149
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:03,140
Like, yeah, no, we did.

1150
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:09,020
to a rooftop like well i mean we're running at people we
don't need to go get into positioning we're just killing

1151
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:18,160
people down also they banned g7 g7 scout band yeah oh oh

Let's do it.

1159
00:54:55,550 --> 00:54:57,010
If I lag this time around, I'll be so sad.

1160
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:58,250
You lag.

1161
00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:00,230
Just say you crashed and de-matter restart.

00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:03,790
Just leave the game.

1164

1165
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:06,190

00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:10,090
You're literally the apex legends.

1168
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:11,530
Thanks, man.

1169
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:12,550
I appreciate that.

1170
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:14,990
Even though you just literally called me dog shit for like
three and a half hours before.

1171
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:26,270
no it's called tough love it makes you stronger i'm trying
to give you motivation to prove me wrong it's actually so

1172
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:34,330
nice to you yeah see you're gonna be like i'm not dog i'm
gonna prove her wrong and then obviously that didn't work

1173
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:43,730
but don't worry in the second game i'll work we got two
points though we had to be at least top 15 leaderboard um i

1174
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:51,070
mean game one is still in progress so i'm oh i guess they're
like subtracting all the kills from the other people but

1175
00:55:51,070 --> 00:55:54,350
it's okay you didn't get a kill so like you don't have to
work on our team

1176
00:55:57,390 --> 00:56:06,270
i mean at least i didn't get that kp there yeah yeah i got
it it was me i believe in moxie too and getting a kill on

1177
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:11,730
the last yeah i did some damage there yeah yeah i'm
surprised you stayed alive dude the smokes and they were so

1178
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:14,970
good yeah i appreciate that They were so good.

1179
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:18,270
You like that discipline I had when I said I'm not going to
smoke?

1180
00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:19,450
I went against the call.

1181
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:20,450
Oh, yeah, you're right.

1182
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:22,410
You went against the IGL.

1183
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:23,750
Yeah.

1184
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:23,950

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1189
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:36,010
The camera call wasn't the right call.

00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:39,050
That's what I respected.

1191
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:40,510

1219
01:00:10,470 --> 01:00:11,930
It depends if we're going to get the attachment or not.

1220
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:12,970
We're already, anyway.

1221
01:00:13,170 --> 01:00:14,430
We're over on the bridge right now.

1222
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:16,870
I want to get the evo cash, but they're kind of gatekeeping
us.

1223
01:00:17,050 --> 01:00:17,410
They're freaks.

1224
01:00:18,810 --> 01:00:19,850
I got one of...

1225
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:21,630
Oh, wait, what the fuck?

1226
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:24,690
Bro, they better not gatekeep us, because then we're going
to have to fight them for sure.

1227
01:00:24,890 --> 01:00:26,110
But I want that blue armor first.

1228
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:28,770
I think everybody wants to...

1229
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:29,770
He's fighting now.

1230
01:00:30,070 --> 01:00:30,590
Not last.

1231
01:00:30,690 --> 01:00:30,970
Not last.

1232
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:32,550
Not last.

1233
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:35,270
I did 63 on two of them.

1234
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:37,590
So I don't really know whether they're still gatekeeping us,
bro.

1235
01:00:37,650 --> 01:00:38,350
These freaks leave.

1236
01:00:39,850 --> 01:00:45,130
i'm a headless chicken right now no cap yeah one on this
roof right here the one over our bridge i don't know where

1237
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:50,250
roof went we've got a meta dipped and they're over left side
now we might be able to get the evo cash we definitely want

1238
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:54,710
to get it so we can get the beacons and stuff yeah if you
can get it that'd be great i'm covering i'm covering for you

1239
01:00:55,550 --> 01:01:00,610
look it over you as well yeah i got two smokes yeah you
should be good you should be good They're far left now.

1240
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:01,550
Yeah, they're rotating.

1241
01:01:01,770 --> 01:01:02,110
They're rotating.

1242
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:02,750
You're five.

1243
01:01:02,850 --> 01:01:03,390
All right.

1244
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:04,890
I'll go do a ring beacon.

1245
01:01:05,170 --> 01:01:05,310
Survey.

1246
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:06,130
I'll do survey.

1247
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:09,590
I'm going to come with you because I think they might be
playing for our beacon.

1248
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:11,750
It's the only reason I can think they're over here.

1249
01:01:13,890 --> 01:01:15,470
So they might be coming back to fight us, Doki.

1250
01:01:15,650 --> 01:01:15,850
We'll see.

1251
01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:18,170
We'll see if I get shot at.

1252
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:19,570
I hope not.

1253
01:01:19,650 --> 01:01:20,310
I'm here with you.

1254
01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:20,950
So we'll see what happens.

1255
01:01:21,330 --> 01:01:22,310
I'll put a portal down for me, B.

1256
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:24,090
I think we're fine.

1257
01:01:24,270 --> 01:01:25,130
I don't think I need a portal.

1258
01:01:25,810 --> 01:01:26,990
No, I'm just saying that's the case.

1259
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:28,350
There you go.

They jumped off.

1293
01:01:57,730 --> 01:01:57,930
They jumped off.

1294
01:01:58,070 --> 01:01:58,070
They jumped off.

1295
01:01:58,070 --> 01:01:58,410

1308
01:02:14,670 --> 01:02:17,250
I put a portal down to get a little aggressive, but I can't
really do much on that.

01:03:06,830 --> 01:03:07,350
Bums now.

1327
01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:07,670
They're there.

1328
01:03:08,010 --> 01:03:08,730
All right, we're gonna move up.

1329
01:03:08,890 --> 01:03:09,690
Let's go to bridge over here.

1330
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:12,130
Watch out with this other team that was kind of lurking near
us.

1331
01:03:12,550 --> 01:03:13,830
I got no bats, by the way.

1332
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:15,290
I'm gonna look at that again, dude.

1333
01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:16,750
These fucking assholes, man.

1334
01:03:17,510 --> 01:03:18,870
Thank you for the thingy.

1335
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:22,850
They're like just staring at us.

1336
01:03:22,850 --> 01:03:23,530
Oh, I gotta read the play.

1337
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:24,090
I gotta read the play.

1338
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:25,690
Yeah, I did too.

1339
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:27,910
But what do these guys do if they want to fight them down?

1340
01:03:28,030 --> 01:03:28,410
But they're gonna see.

1341
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:28,690
Yeah.

1342
01:03:29,310 --> 01:03:32,010
They're playing like rampart, not trying to fight, but
fight.

1343
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:35,770
I hit 160.

1344
01:03:36,830 --> 01:03:38,150
It's fucking assholes, dude.

1345
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:39,170
Back up.

Yeah, you're like, oh, and they threw.

1347
01:03:42,830 --> 01:03:43,770
They're getting on bridge now.

1348
01:03:43,870 --> 01:03:44,270
This is bad.

1349
01:03:44,750 --> 01:03:45,250
Yeah, they have.

1350
01:03:45,410 --> 01:03:46,190
Might have to take a portal.

1351
01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:46,910
Yeah, portal.

1352
01:03:47,070 --> 01:03:47,870

We're good.

1386
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:05,330

They're running away now.

1388
01:05:06,070 --> 01:05:06,250

1408
01:05:28,370 --> 01:05:29,290
Oh, my God.

1409
01:05:29,310 --> 01:05:30,190
We need to get the zone.

1410
01:05:30,550 --> 01:05:31,030
Wait, they're geeking me.

1411
01:05:31,050 --> 01:05:31,630
I swear here.

1412
01:05:31,630 --> 01:05:32,030
Left side.

1413
01:05:32,330 --> 01:05:33,030
Down, down, down.

1414
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:33,410
Oh, nice.

1415
01:05:33,450 --> 01:05:33,970
Oh, my God.

1416
01:05:34,170 --> 01:05:34,330
Boxing.

1417
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:35,370
Oh, my God.

1418
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:39,830
I guess what the fuck was that?

1419
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:40,830
He just bodied me.

1420
01:05:40,990 --> 01:05:41,750
Wait, is that a different team?

1421
01:05:41,850 --> 01:05:42,390
Wait, this is a different team.

1422
01:05:42,530 --> 01:05:43,030
This is a different team.

1423
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:44,030
It has to be.

1424
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:44,350
Has to be.

1425
01:05:44,430 --> 01:05:45,490
Yeah, no, it is a different team.

1426
01:05:45,490 --> 01:05:45,610
Moxie.

1427
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:46,030
It's a different team.

1428
01:05:47,330 --> 01:05:47,610
Boxing.

1429
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:48,230
Oh, my God.

1430
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:51,190
Can we go into portal?

1431
01:05:51,590 --> 01:05:53,330
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

1432
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:53,830
It's all right.

1433
01:05:54,210 --> 01:05:54,830
Run, run, run, run.

1434
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:55,170
You're good.

1435
01:05:55,390 --> 01:05:55,670
You're good.

1436
01:05:56,170 --> 01:05:58,870
Yeah, run upside and then maybe craft up.

1437
01:05:58,990 --> 01:06:00,570
If you need to take your TP back, you might be playing zone.

1438
01:06:01,670 --> 01:06:02,770
No, I will 100%.

1439
01:06:02,770 --> 01:06:03,650
It'll be in zone.

1440
01:06:05,110 --> 01:06:06,210
Maybe you can play it if you need to.

1441
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:08,850
I don't have enough meds for it.

1442
01:06:09,470 --> 01:06:10,110
No meds?

1443
01:06:10,170 --> 01:06:10,530
How many guys?

1444
01:06:10,530 --> 01:06:12,250
I have syringes and two med kits.

1445
01:06:12,530 --> 01:06:13,210
Most of it is just that.

1446
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:16,230
Okay, I think you go, I think you craft us here maybe then.

1447
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:16,810
Yeah?

1448
01:06:16,910 --> 01:06:18,890
If you can, you take, yeah, because the zone's kind of
close.

1449
01:06:18,950 --> 01:06:19,970
I don't think you're going to get anywhere else.

1450
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:24,290
You got this, I believe in you.

1451
01:06:25,810 --> 01:06:34,110
wrapped into zip lunch confidence what is the oh wait i
heard something wait where is the craft there's gonna be one

you get the a beacon though it sucks no but you may be

1453
01:06:42,330 --> 01:06:50,990
finding a respawn somewhere the close one's 330 never mind
and i could try to go for this one yeah it just depends how

1454
01:06:50,990 --> 01:06:57,250
many heals if you can find any more while you're sitting
here too yeah i don't know if i I can find more syringes.

1455
01:06:57,370 --> 01:06:58,310
Yeah, I might be a little bit tough.

1456
01:06:58,490 --> 01:06:58,990
I'll loot it up.

1457
01:06:59,910 --> 01:07:00,070
Yeah.

1458
01:07:00,130 --> 01:07:00,910
Yeah, it's not great.

1459
01:07:01,490 --> 01:07:02,490
I don't see any syringes.

1460
01:07:02,530 --> 01:07:03,730
I heard shots from my right.

1461
01:07:05,770 --> 01:07:07,610
Yeah, I think you just keep going left personally.

1462
01:07:07,950 --> 01:07:08,010
Yeah.

1463
01:07:08,710 --> 01:07:09,670
Get the fuck away from these guys.

1464
01:07:10,170 --> 01:07:11,250
I literally hear shots.

1465
01:07:12,470 --> 01:07:13,670
Oh, I hear shots here too.

1466
01:07:14,210 --> 01:07:14,610
One more.

1467
01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:15,130
Hit your finder.

1468
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:15,890
One more placement.

1469
01:07:16,510 --> 01:07:17,590
All I'm saying is no points.

1470
01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:20,730
Oh.

1471
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:24,290
I only have syringes after this.

1472
01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:26,030
ranges.

1473
01:07:27,050 --> 01:07:27,770
You got this, you got this.

1474
01:07:30,430 --> 01:07:31,530
Turn that building to right.

1475
01:07:31,650 --> 01:07:31,890
What's up?

1476
01:07:32,310 --> 01:07:35,790
I'm just going to try and look at behind that rock, maybe.

1477
01:07:36,810 --> 01:07:37,130
Yeah.

1478
01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:40,090
If you can rotate and lift, this might be your best shot,
but I don't know.

1479
01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:41,710
I don't know if I can get that Riz off.

1480
01:07:41,890 --> 01:07:42,390
That's a thing.

1481
01:07:43,210 --> 01:07:43,550
I don't know.

1482
01:07:44,130 --> 01:07:45,250
So I don't think you can either.

1483
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:46,290
No, I don't know.

1484
01:07:46,410 --> 01:07:46,870
You definitely can.

1485
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:50,050
Is there anywhere safe that you can play, like, ratting for
the rest of the game?

1486
01:07:51,270 --> 01:07:52,190
I'm trying to think.

1487
01:07:53,130 --> 01:07:53,970
Are you not in zone here, right?

1488
01:07:54,230 --> 01:07:54,550
No.

1489
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:55,350
I did.

1490
01:07:55,670 --> 01:07:56,310
Yeah, it's tough.

1491
01:07:56,770 --> 01:07:57,450
Yeah, it's flashing.

1492
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:02,440
That sucks.

1493
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:04,160
There was another team.

1494
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:07,360
Bro, that was my bad.

1495
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:09,140
I greeted the guy who downed.

1496
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:10,280
I was like, dude, this guy's cooked.

1497
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:12,960
It was not cooked.

1498
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:15,560
Bro, we had a armada.

1499
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:19,360
No, I'll talk to him in.

1500
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:20,640
I'm going to throw...

1501
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:22,760
I can throw my ult right here.

1502
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:26,140
I mean, you're safe there, by the way, behind that rock.

1503
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:27,040
You're inside.

1504
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:29,280
But then yeah, but I'm sure they're gonna spot you though.

1505
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:30,400
Yeah, they're gonna spot me.

1506
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:31,640
They're gonna look around.

1507
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:34,520
If you go forward, they're gonna kill you regardless, even
if you queue.

1508
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:35,560
Yeah.

1509
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:41,520
Um, the best thing is I throw my ult right here and then
just hope for the best.

1510
01:08:47,970 --> 01:08:49,690
Tor, why is no one dying?

1511
01:08:49,850 --> 01:08:50,290
I hate it.

1512
01:08:50,330 --> 01:08:50,870
I know.

1513
01:08:51,070 --> 01:08:51,750
What the fuck?

1514
01:08:52,090 --> 01:08:53,250
I bet I'm gonna be the 16 squad.

1515
01:08:53,410 --> 01:08:54,490
I can feel it.

1516
01:08:55,570 --> 01:08:56,490
This is so crazy.

1517
01:08:56,770 --> 01:08:56,990
What the?

1518
01:08:57,110 --> 01:08:57,350
Wait, what?

1519
01:08:57,570 --> 01:08:58,350
That's Moxie Smoke.

1520
01:08:58,710 --> 01:08:59,470
Rings me behind.

1521
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:00,430
Wait, wait, wait.

1522
01:09:00,430 --> 01:09:01,790
So land, it just landed now?

1523
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:03,450
It just landed now, dude.

1524
01:09:03,670 --> 01:09:04,530
I would not throw that, Duggy.

1525
01:09:04,590 --> 01:09:05,590
They're going to 100% hear you.

1526
01:09:06,230 --> 01:09:07,130
No, what if?

1527
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:14,270
If you put that down and you get that off, I will be
mind-blowing.

1528
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:14,790
What if?

1529
01:09:17,690 --> 01:09:18,930
You're so close to sound.

1530
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:19,630
This sucks.

1531
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:21,630
What if I just throw it?

1532
01:09:22,410 --> 01:09:25,270
If you throw that and they don't shoot you, I will literally
be mind-blowing, dude.

1533
01:09:25,830 --> 01:09:28,050
I think that was the...

1534
01:09:28,050 --> 01:09:29,170
What is that throw?

1535
01:09:30,590 --> 01:09:33,510
Okay, and then I go left, so they think I go over.

1536
01:09:34,890 --> 01:09:36,550
Oh my god!

1537
01:09:38,590 --> 01:09:39,490
The strat is that...

1538
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:46,860
You did it, you did it, you're good.

1539
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:47,760
You're good, you're so good.

1540
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:49,160
Wait, you actually might get top 10.

1541
01:09:49,660 --> 01:09:49,940
You're good.

1542
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:52,060
What a fucking horrible throw that was.

1543
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:52,900
We won't talk about it.

1544
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,300
Rachel, I want a play.

1545
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:55,700
Yeah, 50!

1546
01:09:56,140 --> 01:09:57,040
I'm a beautiful job.

1547
01:09:58,180 --> 01:09:58,580
15 plays.

1548
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:00,400
You're good, you're good, you're good.

1549

14, 14.

1552
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:14,060
10 if you literally just walk in the zone as low as possible
13 13 13 13 you're the only person playing without a team

1553
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:23,240
don't say that you really got this okay if someone goes from
this way they'll shoot my portal first so i'll be notified

1554
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:29,980
that's the strat i put it out in the open i put it in the
open so i know if someone's pushing me on my left see see

1555
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:31,180

Yeah.

1589
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:08,340
Maybe you should have popped that Hive Ag tower.

1590
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:10,040
I knew it.

1591
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:10,460

1592
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,440

I told you I should have Evac.

1595
01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:18,040
Dude, this is such a sweaty comp.

1596
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:19,960
Ash caustic lifeline.

1597
01:12:20,380 --> 01:12:21,860
My god, they want to win that.

1598
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:22,900
We couldn't fucking.

1599
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:26,800
I can't believe we couldn't fucking run at teams.

1600
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:29,560
Everyone didn't want us to run at them.

1601
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:30,000
I know.

1602
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:31,240
What the hell was that about?

1603
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:32,380
Why is everyone running away from us?

1604
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:32,920
I know.

1605
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:34,240
They didn't tell me to watch GGs.

1606
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:35,620

i'm the Did it cancel?

1614
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:36,660

Okay, you got it.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1618
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:41,520
Oh, guys, I'll be honest.

1619
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:46,260
The one thing that's really, like, my biggest hindrance
right now is knowing where people are.

1620
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:49,740
Like, half the time, like, you say, like, there's people, I
have no idea where they are.

1621
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:52,800
I'll get better comms of, like, you know, the southwest.

1622
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:53,900
You need a ping more.

1623
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:54,620
You need a ping.

1624
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:55,660
I don't need one ping.

1625
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:56,520
I need spams.

1626
01:13:56,860 --> 01:13:57,360
No, for sure.

1627
01:13:57,380 --> 01:13:57,860
I'll spam it.

1628
01:13:58,120 --> 01:13:59,920
I'm going to communicate in southwest 196.

1629
01:14:00,180 --> 01:14:00,460
You know what I mean?

1630
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:00,980
I'll say all that.

1631
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:01,760
Okay.

1632
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:05,980
because I'm lost in that way, because I don't know.

1633
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:07,760
Yeah, yeah, he's a tier 3 player.

1634
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:10,720
He doesn't, like, understand the game like you, Whig.

1635
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:12,520
Oh, yeah, for sure.

1636
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:14,780
100%.

1637
01:14:14,780 --> 01:14:18,260
It's more so, you know, like, we don't got, we don't got any
scan characters.

1638
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:19,560
It's hard to keep up with the fights.

1639
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:20,140
It's difficult.

1640
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:23,800
Yeah, but USC IGL should tell us that, you know?

1641
01:14:23,860 --> 01:14:24,500
True, my bad.

1642
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:24,880
Yeah.

1643
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:25,760
Again, yeah, my fault, correct.

1644
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:30,680
Your job is to lead us.

1645
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:33,560
And I don't feel the leading part yet.

1646
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:35,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1647
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:36,020
You felt the last game.

1648
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:36,660
I know you did.

1649
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:39,180
No, I know you did.

1650
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:39,720
I felt the last game.

1651
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:40,120
Yeah, yeah.

1652
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:41,280
The last game I felt it.

1653
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:41,720
Yeah, yeah.

1654
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:43,420
I was a commander in action.

1655
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,680
What happened to the second game though?

1656
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:47,560
It's like you like checked out.

1657
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:51,360
Well, one of our game play was a fight and no one wanted to
smoke.

1658
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:52,860
Whoa.

1659
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:55,240
So you're blaming Moxie?

1660
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:57,020
Wait, no, not us.

1661
01:14:57,020 --> 01:14:58,180
The other teams they want to fight.

1662
01:14:58,380 --> 01:14:59,480
So my smoke was bad.

1663
01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:00,120
Yeah, yeah.

1664
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:00,740
You try to say, hey.

1665
01:15:00,740 --> 01:15:02,660
So you're saying I don't want to smoke us.

1666
01:15:02,740 --> 01:15:03,140
Yeah.

1667
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:05,400
No, you had great smokes, man.

1668
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:06,480
Okay, there we go.

1669
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:06,720
Great smokes.

1670
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:10,620
I think your smokes were so good that they didn't want to
fight us.

1671
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:11,580
Oh, okay.

1672
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:14,220
So they're like, well, these guys, this guy smokes too good.

1673
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:15,120
Yeah, okay.

1674
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:16,700
Massive boners.

1675
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,900
This guy smokes fat boners.

1676
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:20,480
Okay, so what should we play then?

1677
01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:25,940
Okay, I think personally, what defensive characters can you
cook up for us?

1678
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:26,740
Well, I don't know.

1679
01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:28,220
Yeah, what kind of...

1680
01:15:28,220 --> 01:15:30,040
I don't even know what that word means.

1681
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:31,500
So defensive, support.

1682
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:32,880
Okay, like support, you know what I mean?

1683
01:15:33,740 --> 01:15:35,500
Give me some defensive characters.

1684
01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:36,800
Name some defensive characters.

1685
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:38,640
Newcastle.

1686
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:40,380
Yeah, I can do it.

1687
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:41,940
I can do it.

1688
01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:41,960
Lifeline.

1689
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:42,680
Lifeline.

1690
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:44,680
Lifeline's good.

1691
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:45,360
Lifeline's good.

1692
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:45,860
That's not bad.

1693
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:46,500
Gibby.

1694
01:15:47,220 --> 01:15:47,560
Yeah.

1695
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:48,820
Okay.

1696
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:50,060
So cook up a comp.

1697
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:51,340
I've had a few games on Gibby in my time.

1698
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:51,720
Yeah.

1699
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:53,060
Cook up some comps for us.

1700
01:15:53,060 --> 01:15:53,400
Wig.

1701
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:56,580
Yeah, I think like a Watson, Watson's really good.

1702
01:15:57,820 --> 01:15:58,320
Okay.

1703
01:15:58,860 --> 01:16:01,560
Okay, no one's confident on any of these characters right
now.

1704
01:16:01,700 --> 01:16:01,900
No, no, I am.

1705
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:02,340
I am.

1706
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:03,720
I just cook up some comps.

1707
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,600
I need to know some comps right now.

1708
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:08,220
Rafe, Watson, okay?

1709
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:09,200
Bang, phenomenal.

1710
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:10,320
Okay, I can do that.

1711
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:11,200
I can do that.

1712
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:12,640
So you can do Watson.

1713
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:13,680
Yeah, I can do Watson.

1714
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:15,380
Okay, are you okay on that?

1715
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:17,840
No, what, what?

1716
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:18,560
Okay.

1717
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:21,400
How did we, how did you get there?

1718
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:22,380
You were saying lifeline.

1719
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:25,120
I said, I could put, like how hard, like, come on, it's
lifeline.

1720
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:26,920
I put my E and then you get it here.

1721
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,060
You got res, you Q when you get your heels.

1722
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:33,460
So for Rafe, Watson.

1723
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:36,060
And my old eye dropped down a care package.

1724
01:16:36,380 --> 01:16:37,780
Like, what's so bad about that?

1725
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:41,680
So she got updated about three years ago.

1726
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:43,720
So she doesn't have her care package anymore.

1727
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:47,460
That actually might have been in 2021.

1728
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:51,840
Okay, okay, okay.

1729
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,500
So I don't know what, what do you mean put your E?

1730
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:55,800
What do you mean by put isn't E?

1731
01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:56,880
What does that mean?

1732
01:16:58,040 --> 01:16:58,840
I don't even know.

1733
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:00,560
Honestly, I don't even know what that means.

1734
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:12,600
the second ability number what's what's the letter number
number what's the letter of it it's a no no okay i'm i'm

1735
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:30,900
getting concerned i'm getting scared now wig i'm getting
scared we keep saying that though but he just got the one kp

1736
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:39,400
yeah and i also got the one kp on the other game too i'm
gonna show you right now i'm learning oh it's cute yeah he's

1737
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:49,920
like you could go to the practice range right now oh so the
z the z is this like shield thing yeah yeah yeah yeah i

1739
01:17:57,620 --> 01:18:00,420
altar great that's actually good for us Yeah, that's good
for us.

1740
01:18:00,860 --> 01:18:02,380
So your Z is like for Lifeline.

1741
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:03,800
So I thought we were playing Bang.

1742
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:05,760
Okay, you want me on Bang?

1743
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:06,420
I'll play Bang.

1744
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:07,020
I'll play Bang.

1745
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:08,900
Okay, so what's the comp?

1746
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:10,520
Watson, Bang, and what?

1747
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:14,580
Wait, you just need to say what we need to be on, all right?

1748
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:14,980
Yeah.

1749
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:15,640
That's all you got to say.

1750
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,640
You got to, you call the boss moves.

1751
01:18:17,740 --> 01:18:18,700
You're the guy with the knowledge.

1752
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:21,160
So I'm going to say it again.

1753
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:24,860
And I want to, let me know if you hear, let me know if you
hear of Lifeline.

1754
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:26,420
Okay, so Bang.

1755
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:27,920
Okay, huh?

1756
01:18:29,740 --> 01:18:37,700
Watson No, not lifeline Now you're confusing us wing Are you
confusing us?

1757
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:39,920
Do we play lifeline or not?

1758
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:41,380
What are we doing?

1759
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:49,380
Watson Yep Wraith Wraith Okay Are you writing this down
Moxie?

1760
01:18:49,540 --> 01:18:51,440
Are you like taking notes right now?

1761
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:55,380
Lifeline Wraith Wraith?

1762
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:55,980
Wraith?

1763
01:18:55,980 --> 01:18:57,460
Who is Wraith?

1764
01:18:58,680 --> 01:18:59,020
Wraith?

1765
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:01,500
You said Wraith You just said dragon base.

1766
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:03,920
I don't know what I'm saying right now.

1767
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:08,040
I'll be honest I'm on a definite different dimension right
now with this game.

1768
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:20,540
Okay, so we don't want Pathfinder Just making sure I just
feel like I didn't like my bangs haven't been Bangin like I

1769
01:19:20,540 --> 01:19:27,740
feel like I'm getting kills, but it's not because my
abilities Okay, so you think my smokes are good Yeah, but we

1770
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:31,480
need the smokes to rotate though Okay, okay, I'll be
smoking.

1771
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:32,560
All right.

1772
01:19:33,460 --> 01:19:33,800
There we go.

1773
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,260
I can lifeline whichever one you want.

1774
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:37,560
I feel like you really want to play lifeline.

1775
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:38,440
If you want to play lifeline.

1776
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:39,340
Do you?

1777
01:19:39,620 --> 01:19:42,560
I feel I just saw lifeline live that whole thing.

1778
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:45,280
Res her teammates without even like just tapping them.

1779
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:49,540
But the thing, the key is that you have to live to be able
to do all of that.

1780
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:55,820
Can you sustain yourself enough to be able to do all that
instead of getting knocked first?

1781
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:57,420
That's okay.

1782
01:19:57,660 --> 01:19:59,540
Yeah, you need to be like last alive type of thing.

1783
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:05,200
of shit you know what i'm saying can you be last alive can
you be last alive okay i could i could play for i could play

1784
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:13,740
for a little damage okay i could try so what does that mean
that's usually not okay i'm not a person that just like sits

1785
01:20:13,740 --> 01:20:20,220
i i have a hard time not wanting to go in but i can try to
reserve myself here oh okay so you're gonna restrain

1786
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:26,920
yourself so you're gonna play lifeline okay so i can play
bang i could do bang so now we're not giving watson we're

I'll go bank.

1789
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:39,220
I feel like this is fucking Because you make it sound like
lifeline's a bad addition to bang lifeline and Wraith so

1790
01:20:39,220 --> 01:20:41,720
like it well, we can't do the addition because it's four.

1791
01:20:41,860 --> 01:20:46,180
That's four characters It would be it would be more of a
substitution.

1792
01:20:46,540 --> 01:20:49,760
Okay, so so what would you substitute lifeline for Watson?

1793
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:57,640
um yeah Yeah, yeah Okay, I'll play bank.

1794
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:04,720
Okay, so so Sorry, the cop is what's the captain's time wig
just to be sure what is the cop

1795
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:11,760

We're doing it, guys.

1803
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:39,480
Let's go down.

1804
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:42,000
Can I go find a guitar right now in this compound?

1805
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:44,520
Someone's got one, though.

1806
01:21:45,260 --> 01:21:46,260
I'm going to go find one.

1807
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:47,840
I'm going to go lock in.

1808
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:52,560
Okay, we're going to do, we're going to be safe this time,

01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:58,300
Do you believe in us, Moxie?

1811
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:00,280
Come on.

1812
01:22:00,580 --> 01:22:03,720
Like, I feel like we're slowly getting, like, tapped in.

1813
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:04,980
Like, I feel like we're building up.

1814
01:22:05,180 --> 01:22:06,040
We're getting better.

1815
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:10,980
I mean, the second game we placed lower, but each game we're
getting better.

1816
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:14,240
Yeah, no, these players ain't.

1817
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:15,880
Like, who's winning these rounds?

1818
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,600
Like, who's getting, who's first place right now?

1819
01:22:18,860 --> 01:22:22,500
First place team is team number four.

1820
01:22:23,860 --> 01:22:24,300
Okay.

1821
01:22:25,060 --> 01:22:26,280
I'll look these people up.

1822
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:27,880
I'm going to take some notes on their, on their team.

1823
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:29,540
You're going to look at their vibes.

1824
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:31,480
Let's see what they're doing differently.

1825
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:34,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1826
01:22:34,620 --> 01:22:35,980

Oh, this guy's on Hambino's team?

1828
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:44,220
Dude, Hambino just owned me in a freaking tournament the
other day.

1829
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:46,000
Oh, different way, Hambino.

1830
01:22:50,610 --> 01:22:51,650
I believe.

1831
01:22:52,490 --> 01:22:53,250
I believe in us.

1832
01:22:53,290 --> 01:22:55,210
Oh, actually, the first place team is...

1833
01:22:55,210 --> 01:23:00,490
I mean, they haven't calculated the second game yet, but
it's team 16.

1834
01:23:00,670 --> 01:23:02,350
That's first place from game one.

1835
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:15,140
okay also all the teams that are better than us right now

believe in nice wigs igl in the third game like we found our

1844
01:24:25,210 --> 01:24:35,070
characters and everything i believe in his guidance i feel
like we're loki sleeping on my pathfinder i think so i don't

1845
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:36,950
know if it's good right now or I don't know.

1846
01:24:38,230 --> 01:24:39,650
Do you want to play?

1847
01:24:39,830 --> 01:24:40,510
Do you want to play it?

1848
01:24:40,550 --> 01:24:40,670
Do you want to play it?

1849
01:24:41,510 --> 01:24:42,270
No, no, I'm good.

1850
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:44,450
I'm just saying like, I feel like we're not really playing
as a team.

1851
01:24:44,590 --> 01:24:49,990
I feel like we should just be playing like as the best thing
that that enhances our own gameplay.

1852
01:24:50,650 --> 01:24:53,710
Okay, so they'll play pass or lifeline.

1853
01:24:54,230 --> 01:24:55,030
Wait, where's Watson?

1854
01:24:55,310 --> 01:24:55,950
Oh, there she is.

1855
01:24:57,850 --> 01:24:59,130
Are you going to go Pathfinder?

1856
01:25:00,130 --> 01:25:00,370
Are you?

1857
01:25:00,610 --> 01:25:01,190
Uh, no.

1858
01:25:01,450 --> 01:25:02,110
I feel like, okay.

1859
01:25:03,230 --> 01:25:05,330
You're just like, are you going to do it?

1860
01:25:06,570 --> 01:25:13,190
but my whole chat's saying path is meta i don't know i'm
getting baited right now but i feel like why would they lie

1861
01:25:13,190 --> 01:25:21,710
it's meta in their hearts okay but like moxie did you see a
single pathfinder when we were fighting those two games well

1862
01:25:21,710 --> 01:25:27,670
yeah the noobs are gonna i mean the noobs aren't gonna be
playing pathfinder you know yeah but did you see the any

1863
01:25:27,670 --> 01:25:38,050
pathfinders though while we were playing you got a point all
right i'm locking in so what's been g7 scout and havoc What

1864
01:25:38,050 --> 01:25:38,950
the fuck?

1865
01:25:39,230 --> 01:25:40,430
Oh shit, were people even playing that?

1866
01:25:40,550 --> 01:25:42,710
Oh, oh that's good.

1867
01:25:43,490 --> 01:25:44,730
Apparently I found a roller, one second.

1868
01:25:45,210 --> 01:25:47,190
Oh nice, nice, nice, nice, more time.

1869
01:25:47,710 --> 01:25:48,450
I made some calls.

1870
01:25:49,930 --> 01:25:52,550
Someone driving over, Uber eats a controller.

1871
01:25:57,290 --> 01:25:58,690
It's okay, I believe in us.

1872
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:04,820
We got scrimmed, but I believe in us.

1873
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:08,340
Someone crashed?

1874
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:09,280
Everyone's here.

1875
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:18,700
Why are people saying scrimps?

1876
01:26:19,060 --> 01:26:25,580
Oh, it's because it's an apex thing where in scrims, they
always end matches before the match starts.

1877
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:28,060
Because someone will crash or something.

1878
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:32,780
It's just like, it's just an apex thing.

1879
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:35,100
Damn, I'm so not tapped in.

1880
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:35,900
I gotta tap in.

1881
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,300
I'm gonna try, it's like, okay, it's okay.

1882
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:49,960
Moxie can pick path now.

1883
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:55,940
Yeah, you know, I'm not gonna try anything.

1884
01:26:55,960 --> 01:27:01,720
fancy i believe it's okay we have four more games four more
games to experiment

1885
01:27:04,850 --> 01:27:13,130
yeah but then when then the games when we figure it out like
we only have that little games left yeah but then we're

1886
01:27:13,130 --> 01:27:19,930
gonna we're gonna drop a bomber we're gonna drop a nuke you
know on the the final game that we figure it out we're just

1887
01:27:19,930 --> 01:27:31,150
gonna kill the entire lobby because we figured it out right
yeah so why is everyone talking about my i've never been an

1999
01:35:39,860 --> 01:35:41,540
That'd be better to be on MNK while I'm lagging.

2000
01:35:41,640 --> 01:35:42,120
I can't lie.

2001
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:44,020
Oh, for sure.

2002
01:35:44,100 --> 01:35:44,880
It's so much better.

2003
01:35:45,100 --> 01:35:47,120
But wouldn't your aim assist kick in when you're lagging?

2004
01:35:48,020 --> 01:35:48,920
Maybe imagine it just slow.

2005
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:49,980
It helps me out so much.

2006
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:51,680
Oh my god.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Are you lagging too?

2010
01:35:55,220 --> 01:35:55,700
It's just me.

2011
01:35:55,920 --> 01:35:56,540
No, it's just you.

2012
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:57,260
No, it's just you.

2013
01:35:57,400 --> 01:35:57,960
It's just you.

2014
01:35:58,100 --> 01:35:58,820
Dude, this is insane.

2015
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:00,460
It's like one player per team.

2016
01:36:00,620 --> 01:36:01,240
I'm just...

2017
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:03,360
That's crazy, bro.

01:36:03,380 --> 01:36:04,940
I saw you float there.

2019
01:36:05,660 --> 01:36:07,280
One of my boys said he was lagging terribly too.

2020
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:08,220
What the fuck is going on?

2021
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:09,260

01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:42,440
Be aware of our presence.

2027
01:36:45,420 --> 01:36:46,360
I can't believe how bad this is.

2028
01:36:46,360 --> 01:36:47,440
This is actually so sad.

2029
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:48,760
Hey, look, a team died, though.

2030
01:36:49,420 --> 01:36:50,100
Yeah, huge for us.

2031
01:36:50,300 --> 01:36:50,560
Fuck them.

2032
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:51,420
Yeah, fuck them.

2033
01:36:52,220 --> 01:36:52,640
Not lost.

2034
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:53,220
Let's go.

2035
01:36:54,040 --> 01:36:54,620
W for us.

2036
01:36:54,660 --> 01:36:55,160
W for us.

2037
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:56,280
W?

2038
01:36:56,580 --> 01:36:57,380
Behind us, actually.

2039
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,460
I can't even fucking look, man.

2040
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:00,140
This is so ass.

2041
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:00,500
Where?

2042
01:37:00,540 --> 01:37:01,240
I'm trying to look right now.

2043
01:37:01,460 --> 01:37:01,860
Behind us.

2044
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:02,680
Someone behind us.

2045
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:04,080
Yeah, they're going to off evac right there.

2046
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:05,580
I think on yours, actually.

2047
01:37:06,060 --> 01:37:08,740
I'll just shoot them so they won't try and...

2048
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:10,880
There's shots from here, too.

2049
01:37:11,180 --> 01:37:12,780
Yeah, there's another team behind him, 100%.

2050
01:37:12,780 --> 01:37:14,720
I'm going to look forward a little bit to see what's going
on.

2051
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:15,740
We're good right now.

2052
01:37:15,980 --> 01:37:16,600
Team on front, Sue.

2053
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:17,740
What?

2054
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:25,340
I don't got the funds for this.

2055
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:26,140
Yeah, you're good.

2056
01:37:26,260 --> 01:37:26,340
You're good.

2057
01:37:26,700 --> 01:37:28,980
If you want, I can put out the alts right now here.

2058
01:37:29,780 --> 01:37:31,860
Yeah, I mean, if you want to put it right here, not against
it.

2059
01:37:31,860 --> 01:37:32,140
Yeah.

2060
01:37:32,260 --> 01:37:32,600
Went down.

2061
01:37:33,300 --> 01:37:34,240
And then you don't have to charge.

2062
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:35,920
Don't have to use your shields anymore.

2063
01:37:36,980 --> 01:37:37,960
Wow, she's smart.

2064
01:37:38,120 --> 01:37:38,640
She's gaming.

2065
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:40,420
I said, oh, my God.

2066
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:42,060
There's a team in front.

2067
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:42,880
There's a team in front of me.

2068
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:44,300
No, this is awful timing.

2069
01:37:44,460 --> 01:37:45,140
I'll help it.

2070
01:37:45,260 --> 01:37:45,940
Yeah, it's good ulti.

2071
01:37:45,980 --> 01:37:46,340
Good ulti, good ulti.

2072
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:46,920
This is bad timing.

2073
01:37:47,700 --> 01:37:47,760
Yeah.

2074
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:48,640
I'm liking so bad.

2075
01:37:48,740 --> 01:37:49,380
This is horrible timing.

2076
01:37:49,620 --> 01:37:50,140
It's fine.

2077
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:50,760
Keep me going.

2078
01:37:50,900 --> 01:37:51,020
We're good.

2079
01:37:51,220 --> 01:37:54,440
I'm going to try to get my possession.

2080
01:37:54,760 --> 01:37:55,460
Try to get fences up if you can.

2081
01:37:55,660 --> 01:37:56,120
Oh, one hit.

2082
01:37:57,380 --> 01:37:57,880
Yeah, we're good.

2083
01:37:57,920 --> 01:37:58,040
We're good.

2084
01:37:58,240 --> 01:37:58,400
Nice, nice.

2085
01:37:58,980 --> 01:37:59,380
We're good.

2086
01:37:59,940 --> 01:38:00,360
Keep holding.

2087
01:38:01,020 --> 01:38:01,340
We're fine.

2088
01:38:01,340 --> 01:38:01,480
We're fine.

2089
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:02,820
Stay inside of again.

2090
01:38:02,980 --> 01:38:03,100
We're good.

2091
01:38:04,740 --> 01:38:05,480
Push it up on board.

2092
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:06,000
On door, on door.

2093
01:38:06,540 --> 01:38:07,480
Oh, dude, this is so ass.

2094
01:38:09,740 --> 01:38:11,200
Dude, they might push up.

2095
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:12,020
They're pushing up.

2096
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:20,120
100 percent percent percent oh i got hit i got hit through
that i'm just lagging man yeah no it's just unlucky that we

that's just unlucky bro i can't even like call to make

2098
01:38:33,020 --> 01:38:40,460
anything happen i'm just lagging everywhere yeah there's
nothing we could do if we're lagging super high i kept

2099
01:38:40,460 --> 01:38:46,040
throwing my smokes down and keep disappearing dude oh yeah
the watson alt does that you have to do it like for further

2100
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:55,060
because the watson up does that oh geez louise i was like

and then i got into their los oh no yeah that's just unlucky

2102
01:39:01,820 --> 01:39:07,440
because they we wig was lagging so it was like a 2v3 right
oh saying you're saying that both of his teammates are on

2103
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:10,820
like 9 000 ping right now Yeah, it's not fun.

2104
01:39:11,140 --> 01:39:12,960
Dude, that's so insane, man.

2105
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:15,680
How is that even possible, brother?

2106
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:20,160
Also, why can't I not see who killed me?

2107
01:39:20,380 --> 01:39:21,420
Oh, they're on streamer.

2108
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:24,440
They're on anonymous mode.

2109
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:27,360
So people can't, like, target other people.

2110
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:29,740
It's just an apex thing.

2111
01:39:36,830 --> 01:39:39,490
No, I think Moxie's all went through.

2112
01:39:39,970 --> 01:39:42,270
I saw you get, like, hits on it.

2113
01:39:43,610 --> 01:39:49,870
30 so it definitely went through yeah it's just unlucky
because we was lagging so it became a 2v3

2114
01:39:53,110 --> 01:40:01,970
and then we were getting pincered too bro i got i got i'm
not gonna lie i ran in circles to get cracked both ways i

2115
01:40:01,970 --> 01:40:09,750
think i got i got fucking um 100 to zero instantly because i
think all three people shot at me i was like i couldn't even

2116
01:40:09,750 --> 01:40:12,290
like like react in time

2117
01:40:15,430 --> 01:40:17,330
That's, that has to be their pro player.

2118
01:40:18,330 --> 01:40:19,430
What the fuck?

2119
01:40:25,460 --> 01:40:28,800
No, their pro literally just hit like 800 damage.

2120
01:40:30,060 --> 01:40:30,620
Who did it?

2121
01:40:31,060 --> 01:40:32,000
Uh, the pro player.

2122
01:40:33,580 --> 01:40:36,560
They did like, they hit like 800 damage on that one team.

2123
01:40:38,740 --> 01:40:40,280
Okay, which one do they shoot in hell?

2124
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:41,000
Okay, which one?

2125
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:42,100
They're Mad Maggie.

2126
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:43,220
Oh, Mad Maggie?

2127
01:40:43,300 --> 01:40:43,560
Yeah.

2128
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:48,040
Yeah, but he's getting all their kills and they're not
getting the KP.

2129
01:40:49,180 --> 01:40:50,440
Yeah, fucking pussies.

2130
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:56,540
Yeah, he's CTG Zuri.

2131
01:40:58,260 --> 01:40:59,260
CTZ Zuri.

2132
01:40:59,580 --> 01:41:00,220
Is that Citadel?

2133
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:02,900
That's Citadel, right?

2134
01:41:02,940 --> 01:41:04,020
I know that from Rivals.

2135
01:41:05,640 --> 01:41:05,820
Yeah.

2136
01:41:06,420 --> 01:41:08,660
That's the only reason why I know that.

2137
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:19,280
Guess 2k damage.

2138
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:20,200
Sheesh.

2139
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:22,640
Maybe it's time for you to pull up Pathfinder.

2140
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:24,900
No, actually, that's what I'm thinking.

2141
01:41:25,180 --> 01:41:27,820
Yeah, yeah, you sat up full of the patsy.

2142
01:41:30,300 --> 01:41:31,180
I might.

2143
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:36,520
Would be funny if Pathfinder gets banned here.

2144
01:41:36,860 --> 01:41:37,320
There's no way.

2145
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:38,780
There's nobody's playing Pathfinder.

2146
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:44,200
Oh, that's the worst part.

2147
01:41:44,360 --> 01:41:47,680
Because it's going to take fucking forever for this game to
end.

2148
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:49,980
That's the worst part about Apex Competitive.

2149
01:41:50,540 --> 01:41:51,960
Dude, by far the worst part.

2150
01:41:52,060 --> 01:41:53,580
You just sit there and you have to just eat it.

2151
01:41:53,640 --> 01:41:54,160
It's terrible.

2152
01:41:55,180 --> 01:42:01,800
hate fucking awful i i that's why like i never do watch
parties of apex competitive because i just don't want to

2153
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:13,480
wait till at the end zone and this is just like like like 70
of just waiting you're just waiting for teams rotating and

2154
01:42:13,480 --> 01:42:21,280
everything and i'm just like like waiting but yeah no the
end game fights are cool but it's like it takes so long for

2155
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:24,660
me to get there no 100 i got it the exact

2156
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,480
Yeah, I hate slow burn.

2157
01:42:29,900 --> 01:42:30,940
Fuck that shit.

2158
01:42:32,040 --> 01:42:34,100
Just want gas gas gas.

2159
01:42:35,580 --> 01:42:40,040
Bro, I feel like this like this ability that goes through
walls and burns is so like Mad Maggie?

2160
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:41,400
Mad Maggie?

2161
01:42:41,900 --> 01:42:43,820
She's really good in turn situations, honestly.

2162
01:42:44,460 --> 01:42:47,240
I mean, do you want to try Mad Maggie, Moxie?

2163
01:42:48,720 --> 01:42:49,700
Oh hell nah.

2164
01:42:51,300 --> 01:42:53,840
But when I play something new for the first time, it's bad.

2165
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:07,300
nice wiggle so analyze that situation besides you know
besides your lag like uh what should we have done or we were

2166
01:43:07,300 --> 01:43:12,700
we just cooked like no no we could like that for sure no so
what would happen if i wasn't lagging i would have swung out

2167
01:43:12,700 --> 01:43:19,640
i got angles on that like stairway to make them not push or
at least help our situation but i just couldn't swing out

2168
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:23,900
and help you guys so they just were able to take so much
space because i just had to sit behind that counter and just

2169
01:43:23,900 --> 01:43:29,920
not die so the drill it's like pretty unfortunate because
the drill the way they placed it was burning us behind the

2170
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:34,240
counter if i'm going to push out a little bit and then cue
back in if i get damaged they don't really have that like

2171
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:42,780
free push every single time yeah it's unfortunate is what it
is yeah so it was just it was just was a 2v3 yeah i mean you

2172
01:43:42,780 --> 01:43:49,940
guys said your best but that's a really hard situation but
i'm watching this maggie this guy is this guy is clean yeah

2173
01:43:49,940 --> 01:43:57,020
that's the the probe there that's zuni man he's so why can't
the other team's pros lag i don't understand understand yeah

2174
01:43:57,020 --> 01:44:04,640
why is it just me man the worst problem why is it our pro
player that's lagging and then other pros are okay that's

2175
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:12,780
what i'm saying bro make the worst fucking bro player in the
lobby lag is ridiculous exactly why nerf us we just hear the

2176
01:44:12,780 --> 01:44:20,060
vibe these katanas are sick though oh yeah no i like the i
always like somebody knows her fire i get like i mean you

2177
01:44:20,060 --> 01:44:29,100
literally have a fucking final fantasy story and i saw you
carrying that no this this tournament's rigged it is dude

2178
01:44:29,100 --> 01:44:39,390
they're blind on us old and bad's a good name what the fuck
that guy just do but i'm not gonna lie i thought that guy

2179
01:44:39,390 --> 01:44:49,590
threw that thing through the portal that'd be cool i don't
think it works like that though wait can you do this too wow

2180
01:44:49,590 --> 01:44:56,130
what i'm mad maggie wait yeah can you play like this no not
not mad maggie but can you play like this yeah 4k

2181
01:44:59,270 --> 01:45:01,970
I gotta let you guys take 4k damage, but I don't know.

2182
01:45:02,150 --> 01:45:02,690
I'm a digit out.

2183
01:45:04,930 --> 01:45:05,910
We're being targeted.

2184
01:45:08,270 --> 01:45:09,910
To seaweed, thai, siwi.

2185
01:45:10,310 --> 01:45:15,290
Maybe like, they like knew exactly, like, basically nerf,
they knew where you were, you were gonna play at the 100

2186
01:45:15,290 --> 01:45:20,930
thieves facility and, like, targeted big docs, they're like,
DDoSing your facility right now.

2187
01:45:22,030 --> 01:45:22,910
I wish.

2188
01:45:23,450 --> 01:45:26,530
Dude, my goal is to get more damage than nice wig combined.

2189
01:45:30,170 --> 01:45:31,650
That's so fucked.

2190
01:45:33,110 --> 01:45:33,910
That's fucked.

2191
01:45:35,650 --> 01:45:36,990
By the Tony Romo of Apex?

2192
01:45:39,010 --> 01:45:40,230
I think it's possible.

2193
01:45:40,670 --> 01:45:41,970
Never want anything, dude.

2194
01:45:42,070 --> 01:45:43,050
Just commentate now, bro.

2195
01:45:43,110 --> 01:45:43,530
That's how it goes.

2196
01:45:43,810 --> 01:45:46,090
I think it's possible only because you're lagging.

2197
01:45:46,470 --> 01:45:49,250
I don't think you can shoot a gun right now in your
situation.

2198
01:45:49,490 --> 01:45:50,270
Yeah, then we can't.

2199
01:45:50,710 --> 01:45:56,110
I think if you are lagging, I think if you are lagging, you
should just like tell, like, Yeah, just be it.

2200
01:45:56,310 --> 01:45:57,090
Can you restart lobby?

2201
01:45:58,030 --> 01:45:59,650
Yeah, I said that to you saying was lagging.

2202
01:45:59,710 --> 01:46:00,590
Ruby was lagging.

2203
01:46:01,310 --> 01:46:02,250
But then Golden Tots was lagging.

2204
01:46:02,330 --> 01:46:04,490
So we had like four people saying they were just doing
exactly what happened to me.

2205
01:46:04,830 --> 01:46:06,030
It was like you DC through the game.

2206
01:46:06,530 --> 01:46:07,290
They should.

2207
01:46:07,990 --> 01:46:08,710
They should.

2208
01:46:08,810 --> 01:46:08,810
They should.

2209
01:46:09,010 --> 01:46:09,170
They should.

2210
01:46:09,610 --> 01:46:09,990
They should.

2211
01:46:09,990 --> 01:46:14,130
I think that one was central and game two was East Coast.

2212
01:46:14,970 --> 01:46:15,590
Oh, OK.

2213
01:46:16,010 --> 01:46:17,190
So I don't know why.

2214
01:46:18,030 --> 01:46:21,050
They dissent our US East gives me 40 MS right now.

2215
01:46:21,890 --> 01:46:23,730
That's almost ending right now.

2216
01:46:23,830 --> 01:46:24,310
Yeah, I don't know.

2217
01:46:24,830 --> 01:46:27,790
Oh, I can finally watch a different team.

2218
01:46:28,150 --> 01:46:28,330
Yay.

2219
01:46:30,770 --> 01:46:32,370
Oh, I think someone else was...

2220
01:46:32,370 --> 01:46:36,590
I think someone else on the other team was lagging because,
like, they instantly left the server.

2221
01:46:40,930 --> 01:46:41,650
Alright, who's their bro?

2222
01:46:43,010 --> 01:46:44,570
I assume this is their bro.

2223
01:46:46,730 --> 01:46:48,130
Just looking at badges.

2224
01:46:50,510 --> 01:46:51,390
You could...

2225
01:46:51,390 --> 01:46:55,690
If you, like, spectate the teammates, you could see their
names, like, on top of their head.

2226
01:46:56,830 --> 01:47:00,330
who's the pro player so i just spectate the pro

2227
01:47:06,020 --> 01:47:14,940
wait when's the last time you played rivals um oh i don't
know not too long ago but probably i was playing it the

2228
01:47:14,940 --> 01:47:24,560
game's good as fuck dude i love that game i also love
watching it yeah it's just just i mean i didn't know apex

2229
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:30,900
has been feeling like quite casual for me how has rivals
been i haven't touched it in a good amount of time though

2230
01:47:30,900 --> 01:47:38,600
like probably a month sucks but i feel like every hero
shooter just has horrible meta after horrible meta yeah no

2231
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:46,740
the meta sucks right now because it's like oh my god look at
all the caught why are we playing cost oh i bet they're

2232
01:47:46,740 --> 01:47:53,500
gonna ban caustic now they got a bad cost they should have
banned them game one fuck that guy yeah i was surprised that

2233
01:47:53,500 --> 01:48:00,080
all two got banned and not caustic because i felt like a lot
of teams were running caustic there that's what i'm saying

2234
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:04,060
why wouldn't we running caustic I don't know, man.

2235
01:48:04,180 --> 01:48:04,920
I thought we were going Pathfinder.

2236
01:48:06,280 --> 01:48:07,040
But like before.

2237
01:48:08,060 --> 01:48:08,460
I don't know.

2238
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:12,400
It took so long for us to fucking figure out how to come.

2239
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:12,860
You know what I mean?

2240
01:48:13,740 --> 01:48:17,780
Throwing in something else, a curveball would have been my
fucking loose fucking brain out.

2241
01:48:19,640 --> 01:48:20,200
Let me see.

2242
01:48:20,240 --> 01:48:21,260
I'm going to go roll over this game.

2243
01:48:21,340 --> 01:48:22,060
See what this feels like.

2244
01:48:22,260 --> 01:48:22,720
Let's do it.

2245
01:48:22,820 --> 01:48:24,580
See how give you what vibes you're feeling.

2246
01:48:25,460 --> 01:48:25,720
Yeah.

2247
01:48:25,740 --> 01:48:27,540
I just want to peep the vibes real quick.

2248
01:48:37,410 --> 01:48:38,470
But I feel like.

2249
01:48:39,490 --> 01:48:40,270
I don't know, man.

2250
01:48:40,390 --> 01:48:41,870
I feel like I'm low-key clueless.

2251
01:48:44,890 --> 01:48:45,410
It's okay.

2252
01:48:45,510 --> 01:48:45,710
It's okay.

2253
01:48:45,810 --> 01:48:49,170
On the fourth game, the fourth game, you're going to figure
it out.

2254
01:48:50,090 --> 01:48:51,030
You're not clueless, dude.

2255
01:48:51,210 --> 01:48:51,590
Why are you clueless?

2256
01:48:52,150 --> 01:48:55,790
Like, should I be going, like, I feel like maybe I should
just go life, like, boom, hit a little heel.

2257
01:48:56,770 --> 01:48:56,910
No.

2258
01:48:58,110 --> 01:48:58,970
I mean, it's up to you.

2259
01:48:58,990 --> 01:49:00,110
I think you go lifeline, bro.

2260
01:49:00,290 --> 01:49:01,430
I think you're itching for it.

2261
01:49:02,210 --> 01:49:02,530
Okay.

2262
01:49:02,710 --> 01:49:03,170
All right.

2263
01:49:03,330 --> 01:49:03,910
Oh, there's a...

2264
01:49:03,910 --> 01:49:04,710
Okay, what are you going to play?

2265
01:49:04,810 --> 01:49:06,270
There's a 10-minute break in between.

2266
01:49:07,430 --> 01:49:08,770
I'll play whatever you think.

2267
01:49:09,550 --> 01:49:10,530
How about that one, man?

2268
01:49:10,990 --> 01:49:11,970
How about that, dude?

2269
01:49:12,250 --> 01:49:13,070
I'm freaking out.

2270
01:49:13,230 --> 01:49:14,690
I don't even know half these characters.

2271
01:49:16,710 --> 01:49:16,990
All right.

2272
01:49:17,110 --> 01:49:20,690
How about we all do get in a party right now?

2273
01:49:21,770 --> 01:49:22,290
Who are?

2274
01:49:22,870 --> 01:49:24,790
Yeah, because there's a 10-minute break.

2275
01:49:25,490 --> 01:49:25,730
Okay.

2276
01:49:26,210 --> 01:49:26,610

I don't even know.

2312
01:51:38,330 --> 01:51:40,630
You know what, I'm seeing no wraiths.

2313
01:51:41,030 --> 01:51:42,710
Yeah, I'm seeing no wraiths, Wig.

2314
01:51:42,830 --> 01:51:44,050
Why are you on wraiths?

2315
01:51:44,050 --> 01:51:44,770
I just played.

2316
01:51:44,970 --> 01:51:45,190
Okay.

2317
01:51:45,570 --> 01:51:46,770
Yeah, I saw, what do you mean?

2318
01:51:46,770 --> 01:51:49,570
Our last two games, you were on wraiths.

2319
01:51:50,990 --> 01:51:52,070
I'm a locktane for us.

2320
01:51:52,650 --> 01:51:56,690
So, like, wait, are you sabotaging our team with these cops?

2321
01:51:57,510 --> 01:51:59,350
No, the lag was, don't you?

2322
01:51:59,470 --> 01:52:01,550
I was on nine million per day.

2323
01:52:03,350 --> 01:52:05,970
Every 30 seconds, it took me out of the game and back in.

2324
01:52:07,010 --> 01:52:08,650
Yeah, but why is no one else playing Raid?

2325
01:52:08,710 --> 01:52:09,710
They're playing Costic.

2326
01:52:10,010 --> 01:52:11,010
They're playing Maggie.

2327
01:52:11,350 --> 01:52:11,950
Yeah, Costic, Maggie.

2328
01:52:12,750 --> 01:52:13,610
I play Maggie.

2329
01:52:13,730 --> 01:52:15,110
I can play Maggie next game.

2330
01:52:15,690 --> 01:52:15,890
All right.

2331
01:52:16,190 --> 01:52:16,310
Deal.

2332
01:52:17,130 --> 01:52:17,490

I love you.

2334
01:52:18,170 --> 01:52:19,850
I love my nice little Mad Maggie gameplay.

2335
01:52:19,930 --> 01:52:20,350
That's cool, man.

2336
01:52:21,330 --> 01:52:22,370
I am on roller though.

2337
01:52:22,550 --> 01:52:23,230
I don't know how this is gonna go dude.

2338
01:52:23,350 --> 01:52:26,930
I'm kind of excited When was the last time you've been on
roller?

2339
01:52:28,510 --> 01:52:29,990
Ooh, seven months ago.

2340
01:52:30,370 --> 01:52:31,190
Oh, what?

2341
01:52:32,210 --> 01:52:33,210
Yeah, I don't play anymore.

2342
01:52:33,690 --> 01:52:34,670
Wait, what?

2343
01:52:35,730 --> 01:52:36,450
Seven months?

2344
01:52:36,870 --> 01:52:37,690
That's crazy.

2345
01:52:38,930 --> 01:52:40,110
I didn't think you were honest man.

2346
01:52:40,910 --> 01:52:41,550
You are.

2347
01:52:41,810 --> 01:52:43,010

01:52:50,690 --> 01:52:50,970
It's over.

2352
01:52:50,990 --> 01:52:55,070
I hate to break it too, but there's no skull town here.

2353
01:52:55,730 --> 01:52:56,410
Yeah, GD.

2354
01:52:56,510 --> 01:52:57,430
Just gun run?

2355
01:52:58,190 --> 01:52:59,190
Just gun run, dude.

2356
01:52:59,390 --> 01:52:59,930
That's it.

2357
01:53:00,390 --> 01:53:03,330

2365
01:53:22,930 --> 01:53:24,230

2369
01:53:31,050 --> 01:53:32,670

Yeah, I know you do.

2397
01:56:03,790 --> 01:56:04,830
It's about your honor, to be honest.

2398
01:56:05,610 --> 01:56:08,750
So what separates like the best player and like a good one?

2399
01:56:10,830 --> 01:56:12,710
Um, I mean, it really just depends, dude.

2400
01:56:13,150 --> 01:56:14,330
You know, like- Depends on what?

2401
01:56:15,270 --> 01:56:15,530
I don't know.

2402
01:56:15,770 --> 01:56:19,150
Mechanics could be like a really good player on like one
character, you know?

2403
01:56:21,410 --> 01:56:31,490
is the main thing aim and then probably after that ability
usage and then movement after that but aim number one which

2404
01:56:31,490 --> 01:56:43,550
is why controller is so good on this goddamn game there you

02:02:08,370 --> 02:02:08,410
Yeah.

2473
02:02:09,410 --> 02:02:10,730
We just start having confidence here, guys.

2474
02:02:11,130 --> 02:02:13,250
Well, I didn't mean to tell you to play Mad Maggie.

2475
02:02:13,450 --> 02:02:14,790
It just seems like you want to go with that.

2476
02:02:15,370 --> 02:02:16,010
I'm not for Maggie.

2477
02:02:16,010 --> 02:02:17,710
I think Doki wants to be with anyone else.

2478
02:02:18,990 --> 02:02:19,650
Okay, wait.

2479
02:02:19,750 --> 02:02:20,550
You also have Pathfinder?

2480
02:02:21,070 --> 02:02:23,550
Okay, so, okay, now I'm confused, guys.

2481
02:02:23,810 --> 02:02:24,790
Now I'm getting confused.

2482
02:02:26,470 --> 02:02:26,790
What is...

2483
02:02:26,790 --> 02:02:27,650
About what part are you confused about?

2484
02:02:27,850 --> 02:02:29,550
Like, what is our comp?

2485
02:02:30,950 --> 02:02:37,070
So, like, caustic, Mad Maggie, and then whatever you want.

2486
02:02:37,510 --> 02:02:39,170
Whatever I want, that's too much free will.

2487
02:02:39,350 --> 02:02:40,210
I don't like that.

2488
02:02:42,030 --> 02:02:45,930
Okay, well, if you want me to decide for you, then we run
the...

2489
02:02:45,930 --> 02:02:48,150
Oh, well, run a little...

2490
02:02:48,150 --> 02:02:59,730
run a little a little um okay never mind and caustic perfect
i love that at us actually kind of like that we should have

2491
02:02:59,730 --> 02:03:07,730
played caustic for the first three games we trolled what do
you mean we what are you wait you're the igl and you fucking

2492
02:03:07,730 --> 02:03:16,310
told us not to play caustic where's the we come from guys
how do we troll yeah any translators this guy speaking

2493
02:03:16,310 --> 02:03:25,110
french i don't know what he's talking about that blaze on
moxie and i we need some type of movement okay so now we

2494
02:03:25,110 --> 02:03:31,950
gotta figure out what moxie and i should play bang bang for
moxie unless he wants to play watson or lifeline or path

2495
02:03:31,950 --> 02:03:41,890
okay okay so i think you play path i think you play path
okay and then who's the third that's a good question so in

2496
02:03:41,890 --> 02:03:49,050
these situations if i'm playing maggie we'd probably like
something Or Watson.

2497
02:03:49,810 --> 02:03:50,770
Which is better?

2498
02:03:51,970 --> 02:03:53,090
I'm good on adding.

2499
02:03:54,550 --> 02:03:54,810
Okay.

2500
02:03:55,750 --> 02:03:57,770
I would say, hmm.

2501
02:03:59,890 --> 02:04:00,810
Ah, it's a tough one.

2502
02:04:00,850 --> 02:04:01,110
It's tough.

2503
02:04:01,190 --> 02:04:02,510
I'm going to say Watson for sure is better.

2504
02:04:03,150 --> 02:04:04,050
I got this.

2505
02:04:04,130 --> 02:04:04,830
Watson, Tad.

2506
02:04:05,350 --> 02:04:07,890
Are you guys in the zone in the in the custom game?

2507
02:04:08,030 --> 02:04:08,690
Yeah, not only me.

2508
02:04:08,730 --> 02:04:09,050
I'm coming.

2509
02:04:09,270 --> 02:04:13,430
By the way, there's three people missing and two of them are
on my team.

2510
02:04:14,090 --> 02:04:14,390
Okay.

2511
02:04:14,590 --> 02:04:15,170
What's the code?

2512
02:04:15,270 --> 02:04:15,750
That's the code?

2513
02:04:16,210 --> 02:04:17,350
Where's the code hiding?

2514
02:04:17,390 --> 02:04:17,710
Okay.

2515
02:04:18,870 --> 02:04:22,390
It is on the Battle 5, by the way, guys.

2516
02:04:23,030 --> 02:04:23,490
But it's okay.

2517
02:04:23,490 --> 02:04:23,990
I've looked once.

2518
02:04:24,050 --> 02:04:25,670
I'm depending on you for that one thing there.

2519
02:04:25,850 --> 02:04:26,030
You know what I mean?

2520
02:04:26,510 --> 02:04:26,770
Yeah, yeah.

2521
02:04:26,970 --> 02:04:31,550
No, I may have been spamming the same code you linked me for
40 minutes ago.

2522
02:04:32,810 --> 02:04:32,950
So.

2523
02:04:33,870 --> 02:04:35,130
Yeah, I got you guys the code.

2524
02:04:35,250 --> 02:04:35,510
It's okay.

2525
02:04:35,570 --> 02:04:37,030
We're not the last people in.

2526
02:04:38,210 --> 02:04:38,670
Thank God.

2527
02:04:39,270 --> 02:04:39,550
Okay.

2528
02:04:39,630 --> 02:04:39,910
We're good.

2529
02:04:40,250 --> 02:04:41,650
We got the wall now.

2530
02:04:41,990 --> 02:04:44,590
So you can, I guess you go downstairs.

2531
02:04:45,190 --> 02:04:45,430
Wait.

2532
02:04:45,610 --> 02:04:47,310
This map, this map is getting hard.

2533
02:04:47,430 --> 02:04:48,070
It's a tough map.

2534
02:04:48,150 --> 02:04:53,330
but it's gonna be a little bit more difficult for us for
sure oh my god it's even harder i think this map i think

2535
02:04:53,330 --> 02:04:57,150
this map is harder yeah i would say and i'm also on roller
now so it might be a little more difficult we're gonna see

2536
02:04:57,150 --> 02:05:03,310
what's going on wait but what about your aim assist yeah i
don't really don't matter but it's seven months dude yeah

2537
02:05:03,310 --> 02:05:09,750
but it's like riding a bicycle yeah you ride like riding a
bike yeah it's like riding a bike the controller takes over

2538
02:05:12,410 --> 02:05:20,650
oh i'm really rocking up now i say all right wall you guys
laid up top i go down down below okay wait but what

2539
02:05:20,650 --> 02:05:30,870
character right oh i'm playing watson i figured it out and
i'm on pathfinder really dude you just shed 90 times i was

2540
02:05:30,870 --> 02:05:38,530
saying caustic i was so underneath this impression i was
playing caustic yeah he's bad bro i know he needs you

2541
02:05:38,530 --> 02:05:46,150
brother they found out that we were filing up like caustic
and then they added a fifth bad that's crazy i did not want

2542
02:05:46,150 --> 02:05:52,210
publishing bro so i think you go i think you go path man

don't know what everyone's gonna be playing in this

2544
02:05:56,710 --> 02:06:03,350
situation there's a lot of bands i think it might be comfort
picks like whatever you think is the best for you type of

2545
02:06:03,350 --> 02:06:12,950
style of gameplay coming out here soon okay okay yep so i
would say you know we follow that maybe a little bit let me

2546
02:06:12,950 --> 02:06:16,890

2547
02:06:17,970 --> 02:06:19,110
I actually love that brush.

2548
02:06:19,390 --> 02:06:21,370
Every character we want to play, they just bat us.

2549
02:06:22,670 --> 02:06:23,710
I really hope that happens.

2550
02:06:24,210 --> 02:06:25,630
I'm legit going to be first-time, Inc.

2551
02:06:28,410 --> 02:06:28,790
All right.

2552
02:06:29,730 --> 02:06:31,110
Pathfinder, and you're going Watson?

2553
02:06:31,770 --> 02:06:32,030
Yeah.

2554
02:06:32,610 --> 02:06:33,290
I'm Watson.

2555
02:06:34,190 --> 02:06:34,630
Okay.

2556
02:06:35,130 --> 02:06:38,350
I'm going to be Watson, and I'm going to be Mad Maggie.

2557
02:06:39,010 --> 02:06:39,750
Oh, man, guys.

2558
02:06:39,770 --> 02:06:41,170
I'm very greedy, guys.

2559
02:06:41,250 --> 02:06:43,390
I'm a very selfish player when I play Pathfinder.

2560
02:06:43,550 --> 02:06:44,790
I got to start thinking, like, for the team.

2561
02:06:44,790 --> 02:06:45,650
I mean, I saw...

2562
02:06:46,230 --> 02:06:47,250
I can't lie.

2563
02:06:47,770 --> 02:06:48,090
Good, man.

2564
02:06:48,570 --> 02:06:49,330
Be a little selfish.

2565
02:06:49,710 --> 02:06:50,330
Yeah, be selfish.

2566
02:06:50,890 --> 02:06:57,710
I'm not going to lie, that one game where I downed someone,
my Loki was running in the zone thing and you guys were dead

2567
02:06:57,710 --> 02:06:59,350
and you guys were both full because I was low.

2568
02:07:00,630 --> 02:07:00,950
So.

2569
02:07:02,370 --> 02:07:04,690
Oh, so that's how you sacrifice for yourself.

2570
02:07:05,810 --> 02:07:06,370
That's good.

2571
02:07:06,530 --> 02:07:07,410
Oh, no, that was after.

2572
02:07:07,470 --> 02:07:07,990
You need that.

2573
02:07:08,170 --> 02:07:09,330
Now, you need that in Apex Legends.

2574
02:07:09,430 --> 02:07:10,230
You really have to be selfish.

2575
02:07:10,950 --> 02:07:12,070
Yeah, I want to be like a rat.

2576
02:07:12,170 --> 02:07:13,630
I want to really just rat and run.

2577
02:07:14,310 --> 02:07:15,830
Well, maybe we can do the strat.

2578
02:07:16,290 --> 02:07:17,330
after we die, you know?

2579
02:07:17,510 --> 02:07:18,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2580
02:07:18,070 --> 02:07:23,690
Or we could do the strat where, like, we all go our separate
ways and start riding in three separate corners.

2581
02:07:24,590 --> 02:07:26,390
Well, I was just, like, scared of...

2582
02:07:28,390 --> 02:07:32,250
You guys dying, because these guys, like, kind of beamed me,
so I was like, oh, shit, they're good.

2583
02:07:33,190 --> 02:07:34,530
But you thought that we had no chance.

2584
02:07:34,870 --> 02:07:36,530
Yeah, yeah, at least they're better than me.

2585
02:07:37,710 --> 02:07:38,070
So...

2586
02:07:38,070 --> 02:07:40,150
So that means you think you're better than both of us, yeah.

2587
02:07:40,370 --> 02:07:40,630
Yeah.

2588
02:07:41,310 --> 02:07:42,210
Understood, yeah.

2589
02:07:42,590 --> 02:07:43,050
I believe.

2590
02:07:43,070 --> 02:07:43,890
And a 2v3.

2591
02:07:44,330 --> 02:07:44,570
Tasha.

2592
02:07:45,230 --> 02:07:45,590
Yeah.

2593
02:07:46,410 --> 02:07:50,990
Okay I'm so confident going into this game guys.

2594
02:07:50,990 --> 02:07:53,190
This is really gonna be the one right now This is it.

2595
02:07:53,390 --> 02:07:55,230
We're so warmed up now guys.

2596
02:07:55,290 --> 02:07:55,890
This is it.

2597
02:07:56,090 --> 02:07:56,350
I understand.

2598
02:07:56,830 --> 02:07:58,210
The fourth game is where we lock it in.

2599
02:07:58,350 --> 02:07:58,810
Where's Watson?

2600
02:07:59,710 --> 02:08:00,050
Oh boy.

2601
02:08:00,290 --> 02:08:00,630
Where's Watson?

2602
02:08:00,770 --> 02:08:04,910
Oh, there she I was the first game is where we lock it in
guys.

2603
02:08:05,610 --> 02:08:06,610
I had to see if you were gonna get it.

2604
02:08:06,710 --> 02:08:13,030
I wasn't even gonna tell you At that point made the fuck it
like you know, I mean nice little default pathfinder love

2605
02:08:13,030 --> 02:08:17,870
that out of us We're dialed I don't even know if...

2606
02:08:17,870 --> 02:08:19,310
Yeah, I have no skins.

2607
02:08:21,610 --> 02:08:22,350
Here's the comeback.

2608
02:08:22,690 --> 02:08:24,370
I believe in the comeback, guys.

2609
02:08:25,490 --> 02:08:25,830
Look at that.

2610
02:08:25,830 --> 02:08:26,110
Look at that.

2611
02:08:26,290 --> 02:08:26,970
Look at the kills, though.

2612
02:08:27,230 --> 02:08:28,570
Oh, oh, 7,000.

2613
02:08:28,970 --> 02:08:30,010
Yeah, wait a minute.

2614
02:08:30,590 --> 02:08:32,210
You're an experienced Apex-ledding gamer.

2615
02:08:32,810 --> 02:08:35,770
Wait, did I just saw 0, 0, 0 from your Mad Maggie?

2616
02:08:37,970 --> 02:08:38,330
Yeah.

2617
02:08:39,030 --> 02:08:39,930
It wasn't like...

2618
02:08:39,930 --> 02:08:42,610
It was all like season 0, like season, like whatever kills.

2619
02:08:42,730 --> 02:08:44,070
Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.

2620
02:08:44,550 --> 02:08:45,830
I played a lot of Mad Maggie my time.

2621
02:08:45,870 --> 02:08:46,130
Don't worry.

2622
02:08:46,150 --> 02:08:47,230
All right, that's good to know.

2623
02:08:47,310 --> 02:08:47,850
That's good to know.

2624
02:08:47,870 --> 02:08:48,470
We're on control though.

2625
02:08:48,590 --> 02:08:48,870
Never on control.

2626
02:08:49,150 --> 02:08:50,210
I got a little worried there.

2627
02:08:51,570 --> 02:08:55,110
I haven't played Roller in seven months, and I've never
played Matt Maggie on Roller.

2628
02:08:55,270 --> 02:08:55,630
It's okay.

2629
02:08:55,730 --> 02:08:57,050
Our name is WashG.

2630
02:08:57,070 --> 02:08:57,930
They know what they were getting.

2631
02:08:58,130 --> 02:08:58,970
They know what they were getting.

2632
02:09:00,050 --> 02:09:01,870
Definitely know what they're going to get with this one for
sure.

2633
02:09:02,130 --> 02:09:04,410
I did not go down below, by the way, because I was scared
for a second, so.

2634
02:09:05,150 --> 02:09:05,290
Oh.

2635
02:09:05,950 --> 02:09:08,230
I don't even know what down below means.

2636
02:09:08,470 --> 02:09:10,470
Um, are you going to go down below?

2637
02:09:11,170 --> 02:09:11,730
We'll go there.

2638
02:09:11,750 --> 02:09:12,330

Well, I have ring console already, so you don't need it.

2666
02:11:42,210 --> 02:11:42,970
Yeah, you don't need that.

2667
02:11:42,970 --> 02:11:43,770
You should get the survey.

2668
02:11:44,770 --> 02:11:45,730
This is insane.

2669
02:11:45,930 --> 02:11:46,050
This is bad.

2670
02:11:46,330 --> 02:11:46,790
I'm lagging too.

2671
02:11:46,790 --> 02:11:47,450
Look at this.

02:11:52,030 --> 02:11:52,810
No, this is terrible.

2675
02:11:53,050 --> 02:11:53,910

The zone is going to end in cascade balls, so right
underneath cascade it's going.

2679
02:12:00,370 --> 02:12:01,730
I mean, we could just set up now.

No one's in there.

We're going to go.

02:15:26,570 --> 02:15:26,970
We should be good.

2723
02:15:27,030 --> 02:15:27,630
I don't think anyone's in there.

2724
02:15:29,630 --> 02:15:30,990
Are we living in that house?

2725
02:15:31,790 --> 02:15:34,610
We're not going to try to move a little bit deeper, but I'm
nervous to land on lagging.

2726
02:15:34,710 --> 02:15:35,350
I'm so nervous.

2727
02:15:37,310 --> 02:15:38,330
Well, I think we're good now.

2728
02:15:38,570 --> 02:15:38,670
We're good.

2729
02:15:39,190 --> 02:15:39,510

02:15:44,670 --> 02:15:45,230
I'm chilling.

2737
02:15:45,450 --> 02:15:46,130
I'm doing not bad.

2738
02:15:46,410 --> 02:15:48,810
Well, you know, players, players, players to East.

East, okay.

2740
02:15:50,230 --> 02:15:50,650
I'm playing.

2741
02:15:50,650 --> 02:15:51,510
You're gonna shot at.

2742
02:15:51,650 --> 02:15:52,110
Right here.

2743
02:15:52,690 --> 02:15:53,170
There's a player.

2744
02:15:53,270 --> 02:15:54,450
There's shots here, too.

2745
02:15:55,390 --> 02:15:55,790
Yep, yep.

2746
02:15:56,870 --> 02:15:57,810
Should we just stay here for now?

2747
02:15:58,290 --> 02:15:59,190
Oh, we're lagging again?

2748
02:15:59,350 --> 02:15:59,470
Okay.

2749
02:15:59,670 --> 02:15:59,870
I'm up.

2750
02:16:01,010 --> 02:16:01,310
Yep.

2751
02:16:01,470 --> 02:16:01,930
I felt that.

2752
02:16:01,950 --> 02:16:02,990
It's just gonna come and go.

2753
02:16:03,310 --> 02:16:03,930
That's all it is.

2754
02:16:04,650 --> 02:16:06,090
I got no long range guns.

2755
02:16:13,280 --> 02:16:13,820
It's okay.

2756
02:16:14,840 --> 02:16:15,440
I'm okay.

2757
02:16:17,400 --> 02:16:18,480
Looking behind us.

2758
02:16:23,970 --> 02:16:25,190
So where are we moving to?

2759
02:16:25,830 --> 02:16:27,710
We're going to go over here late game.

2760
02:16:27,970 --> 02:16:28,290
Okay.

2761
02:16:28,430 --> 02:16:29,190
Like an evac tower or something.

2762
02:16:29,310 --> 02:16:31,650
But for right now we definitely don't want to land over
there because we had a bunch of people.

2763
02:16:31,890 --> 02:16:32,410
Yeah, two over here.

2764
02:16:33,250 --> 02:16:34,010
I see it.

2765
02:16:34,230 --> 02:16:35,490
I'm just going to let them know.

2766
02:16:35,530 --> 02:16:36,450
I can't even pay, bro.

2767
02:16:37,210 --> 02:16:37,850
I'm here.

2768
02:16:38,150 --> 02:16:38,850
Get out.

2769
02:16:41,450 --> 02:16:43,270
Just letting them know that we're here, you know?

2770
02:16:43,770 --> 02:16:44,950
Oh, there's people here too.

2771
02:16:45,390 --> 02:16:46,250
Yeah, it's fine.

2772
02:16:47,390 --> 02:16:48,150
Hit one somehow.

2773
02:16:50,130 --> 02:16:50,850
No damage.

2774
02:16:51,670 --> 02:16:51,850
Yep.

2775
02:16:53,890 --> 02:16:55,150
This is nutty.

2776
02:16:57,070 --> 02:16:58,670
I see a charge rifle to our right.

2777
02:16:58,750 --> 02:16:59,350
Did you see that?

2778
02:17:00,010 --> 02:17:00,670
I did see that.

2779
02:17:00,790 --> 02:17:01,350
I did see that.

2780
02:17:01,490 --> 02:17:03,050
There's a charge rifle in this direction.

2781
02:17:06,530 --> 02:17:08,550
Try to see if there's anywhere for us to land later.

2782
02:17:12,840 --> 02:17:14,600
Watson fences over there.

2783
02:17:15,600 --> 02:17:16,500
Watson fences there.

2784
02:17:17,340 --> 02:17:18,160
We're good, though.

2785
02:17:19,240 --> 02:17:19,860
Mm-hmm.

2786
02:17:21,540 --> 02:17:22,240
Feel that.

2787
02:17:22,360 --> 02:17:23,000
Check, check, check.

2788
02:17:23,620 --> 02:17:23,980
We're good.

2789
02:17:24,100 --> 02:17:24,360
We're good.

2790
02:17:24,380 --> 02:17:24,600
Check, check.

2791
02:17:24,980 --> 02:17:25,540
Play slow.

2792
02:17:25,760 --> 02:17:26,060
Play slow.

2793
02:17:26,220 --> 02:17:26,800
We're good to go.

2794
02:17:27,820 --> 02:17:28,680
And more teams die.

2795
02:17:28,740 --> 02:17:29,700
Let the lag come out.

2796
02:17:29,860 --> 02:17:30,460
And then we're good to go.

2797
02:17:30,640 --> 02:17:31,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2798
02:17:31,980 --> 02:17:32,760
Let them die by the lag.

2799
02:17:33,080 --> 02:17:34,240
Someone needs it.

2800
02:17:34,420 --> 02:17:34,620
Yeah.

2801
02:17:34,620 --> 02:17:34,860
I'm good.

2802
02:17:34,980 --> 02:17:35,580

No, we're good.

2807
02:17:38,860 --> 02:17:39,340
We're good.

2808
02:17:41,600 --> 02:17:42,600
They're moving up.

2809
02:17:43,240 --> 02:17:43,740
Blue armor?

2810
02:17:44,020 --> 02:17:44,200
Looking?

2811
02:17:44,960 --> 02:17:45,540
Yep, yep.

2812
02:17:45,640 --> 02:17:47,080
They're just trying to smoke me, but you'll miss.

2813
02:17:47,560 --> 02:17:48,420
They hit me.

2814
02:17:48,520 --> 02:17:49,020
I'll get up.

2815
02:17:49,160 --> 02:17:49,820
Did it hit me?

2816
02:17:50,300 --> 02:17:51,240
They hit me now?

2817
02:17:51,940 --> 02:17:52,620

2818
02:17:52,920 --> 02:17:53,200
Okay.

2819
02:17:53,360 --> 02:17:53,840
You don't want to kill me?

2820
02:17:53,900 --> 02:17:54,060
Really?

2821
02:17:54,380 --> 02:17:54,720
All right.

2822
02:17:54,800 --> 02:17:56,520
I'll put an alt right here then.

2823
02:17:57,560 --> 02:17:58,520
Yeah, maybe just put one down.

2824
02:17:59,380 --> 02:18:01,200
We're just going to try to hold this building as much as
possible.

2825
02:18:01,700 --> 02:18:02,160
I'll put it here.

2826
02:18:02,320 --> 02:18:03,680
These guys are going to push us.

2827
02:18:03,860 --> 02:18:04,560
Are they actually pushing?

2828
02:18:05,680 --> 02:18:06,680
I don't think so.

2829
02:18:06,740 --> 02:18:07,060
I don't think so.

2830
02:18:07,120 --> 02:18:07,620
They're rotating.

2831
02:18:07,760 --> 02:18:08,640
They rotate it to the left.

2832
02:18:09,360 --> 02:18:09,520
Okay.

2833
02:18:09,580 --> 02:18:10,220
We want them gone.

2834
02:18:11,340 --> 02:18:12,460
Got some damage on the board.

2835
02:18:13,300 --> 02:18:13,600

02:19:14,290 --> 02:19:15,150

2865
02:19:46,990 --> 02:19:51,830
tank like that's kind of gross Yeah, it is Duck Hunt tab.

2866
02:19:53,030 --> 02:19:54,170
Duck Hunt is crazy.

2867
02:19:55,970 --> 02:19:57,210
I want to see where Zone goes.

2868
02:19:57,690 --> 02:19:59,290
It's pulling away, so that was expected.

2869
02:20:00,090 --> 02:20:01,090
It's pulling to us.

2870
02:20:01,890 --> 02:20:03,050
No, it's gonna be pretty far.

2871
02:20:03,130 --> 02:20:04,430
Yeah, I mean, we're definitely in the right spot.

2872
02:20:04,570 --> 02:20:06,090
I just don't know where we can land safely right now.

2873
02:20:06,290 --> 02:20:07,050
It's like my next concern.

2874
02:20:07,470 --> 02:20:08,630
I don't know if these buildings are taken.

2875
02:20:08,730 --> 02:20:10,370
We don't have a character that can really tell us that.

2876
02:20:11,450 --> 02:20:12,270
So we might have to eat back.

2877
02:20:12,970 --> 02:20:13,910
Yeah, there's someone here.

2878
02:20:14,070 --> 02:20:14,390
Someone there.

2879
02:20:15,430 --> 02:20:16,330
Yeah, on the left one.

2880
02:20:16,370 --> 02:20:17,030
Yeah, a big one, right?

2881
02:20:17,090 --> 02:20:17,390
Yeah, yeah.

2882
02:20:18,210 --> 02:20:19,610
Is there someone in this small one?

2883
02:20:19,710 --> 02:20:20,290
You see this?

2884
02:20:20,490 --> 02:20:20,950
I don't know.

2885
02:20:22,350 --> 02:20:23,370
I can't really tell.

2886
02:20:24,030 --> 02:20:25,290
Put a drill down and maybe get some recoil.

2887
02:20:28,330 --> 02:20:29,310
There's someone right here.

2888
02:20:30,530 --> 02:20:30,650
Okay.

2889
02:20:31,070 --> 02:20:31,750
We're gonna put a nearby down.

2890
02:20:31,890 --> 02:20:33,310
We're at the fly late game, okay?

2891
02:20:33,390 --> 02:20:34,110
Like last second.

2892
02:20:34,410 --> 02:20:35,810
We're going to...

2893
02:20:35,810 --> 02:20:36,690
Our goal?

2894
02:20:36,970 --> 02:20:38,310
Our goal is to go to this, by the way.

2895
02:20:38,730 --> 02:20:39,050
Right here.

2896
02:20:39,150 --> 02:20:40,970
I might have notified a team that we're back.

2897
02:20:41,050 --> 02:20:42,150
Oh, wait, that guy has a car.

2898
02:20:42,230 --> 02:20:42,970
Someone's got a car.

2899
02:20:42,970 --> 02:20:44,090

They repositioned here.

2903
02:20:47,570 --> 02:20:48,330
They repositioned here.

2904
02:20:48,730 --> 02:20:49,690

Are you serious?

2927
02:22:01,800 --> 02:22:04,100
Our rotation was so good.

2928
02:22:04,720 --> 02:22:06,000
That was our best run.

2929
02:22:06,160 --> 02:22:07,240
Are you serious?

2930
02:22:08,840 --> 02:22:12,300
Bro, we just went crazy on it.

2931
02:22:12,540 --> 02:22:12,760
Bro, we just went crazy on it.

2932
02:22:12,760 --> 02:22:13,940
Bro, we survived.

2933
02:22:15,540 --> 02:22:16,480
I just, dude.

2934
02:22:16,580 --> 02:22:17,120
As they knew.

2935
02:22:17,300 --> 02:22:21,000
They knew they were like, they rolled the numbers and they
saw us at the end.

2936
02:22:21,300 --> 02:22:22,760
So they were like, we gotta end it.

2937
02:22:23,620 --> 02:22:25,880
We just cooked so fucking hard, man.

2938
02:22:26,300 --> 02:22:27,580
They saw us at the end.

2939
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:31,200
And they, they, they saw my damage on the board.

2940
02:22:31,320 --> 02:22:33,040
They were saying, well, he's cooking too hard.

2941
02:22:33,340 --> 02:22:34,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2942
02:22:35,680 --> 02:22:37,500
I feel so bad for Nia, man.

2943
02:22:37,600 --> 02:22:38,700
She's definitely stressed.

2944
02:22:40,400 --> 02:22:41,000
Oh, I feel bad.

2945
02:22:41,080 --> 02:22:44,020
But everyone's complaining about the lag last game, too.

2946
02:22:50,970 --> 02:23:01,390
couple last three games yeah it's just tough dude i don't
know what they could do postpone the tournament and then

2947
02:23:01,390 --> 02:23:11,730
demand cryo how did they not get cryo anyways i don't know
how do you not how is like no one from the apex scene like a

2948
02:23:11,730 --> 02:23:16,490
dev that should be operating this like helping them out with
coach this is great because it's an official creator

2949
02:23:16,490 --> 02:23:22,150
tournament too it is i mean they have like help from V&M
who's like running Scrims before, but this is so bad.

2950
02:23:22,190 --> 02:23:24,510
I feel so bad for her.

2951
02:23:25,210 --> 02:23:27,870
It's not like anyone, it's not her fault, obviously, but
it's like so insane.

2952
02:23:30,090 --> 02:23:30,110
Wild.

2953
02:23:31,130 --> 02:23:32,810
Someone give her fucking prio codes, man.

2954
02:23:32,950 --> 02:23:34,850
Someone that knows fucking Scrim codes, give her one.

2955
02:23:37,610 --> 02:23:38,430
That's Scrims also.

2956
02:23:38,750 --> 02:23:40,190
Scrims haven't been laggy, though, right?

2957
02:23:41,070 --> 02:23:41,470
Like...

2958
02:23:41,470 --> 02:23:46,270
No, they've been better, but like really like, yeah, I mean,
even better for sure.

2959
02:23:46,730 --> 02:23:47,130
100%.

2960
02:23:47,130 --> 02:23:49,010
But they're still just lag here and there no matter what.

2961
02:23:49,090 --> 02:23:50,590
But I'm not this bad.

2962
02:23:50,810 --> 02:23:52,070
This is like pretty fucking terrible.

2963
02:23:52,490 --> 02:23:52,650
Mm-hmm.

2964
02:23:56,280 --> 02:23:58,540
I mean, a lot of teams died so early.

2965
02:24:08,870 --> 02:24:09,710
It's okay.

2966
02:24:10,630 --> 02:24:14,330
As long as we're having a good time together as a team.

2967
02:24:14,570 --> 02:24:15,530
That's what I'm talking about.

2968
02:24:16,270 --> 02:24:17,650
That's what I'm talking about, man.

2969
02:24:18,390 --> 02:24:20,390
We are having a great time together.

2970
02:24:20,850 --> 02:24:21,370
Teamwork.

2971
02:24:21,670 --> 02:24:22,190
Exactly.

2972
02:24:23,650 --> 02:24:24,170
Teamwork.

2973

I don't even know where you find these codes.

2982
02:25:35,290 --> 02:25:36,290
There's so many channels in this.

2983
02:25:37,430 --> 02:25:39,890
Like, you'd think it'd be an announcement or something.

2984
02:25:40,910 --> 02:25:41,390
It's healer.

2985
02:25:41,430 --> 02:25:42,870

2986
02:25:42,990 --> 02:25:43,230

I fucking hate that website.

I think fucked me over so many times.

2992
02:25:54,370 --> 02:25:54,750
Fuck that shit.

2993
02:26:21,350 --> 02:26:22,710
I believe in this.

2994
02:26:29,850 --> 02:26:40,750
froze and there was a phase out on me so that's that must
suck apparently someone the reason said she restarted in the

2995
02:26:40,750 --> 02:26:47,730
first place because a whole team froze and they got killed
immediately oh really oh that sucks it does suck

2996
02:26:57,060 --> 02:27:04,680
guys i bet you in the new game in this new lobby that we're
getting the end zone will be like on the other side of the

2997
02:27:04,680 --> 02:27:07,480
map i feel it

2998
02:27:18,520 --> 02:27:20,200
Why are you wishing that on us, dude?

2999
02:27:21,640 --> 02:27:23,240
I'm going to watch this as a diary.

3000
02:27:23,260 --> 02:27:24,820
What if I'm reverse jinxing it?

3001
02:27:25,020 --> 02:27:27,360
And then, like, the game was, like, I'm going to prove her
wrong.

3002
02:27:27,780 --> 02:27:29,200
And then they reverse jinx it.

3003
02:27:31,100 --> 02:27:31,960
That could happen.

3004
02:27:36,390 --> 02:27:36,790
All right.

3005
02:27:36,810 --> 02:27:37,810
We'll see what happens here.

3006
02:27:37,990 --> 02:27:38,530

Well, how about you literally just, you know, manifest?

3008
02:27:43,190 --> 02:27:45,690
No, if I manifest, it never goes well.

3009
02:27:48,030 --> 02:27:49,810
That's if I, that's too much hope.

3010
02:27:50,410 --> 02:27:50,830

Restraining order.

Yeah, but that attention is kind of nice.

3024
02:29:31,960 --> 02:29:33,600

Enough room in this fucking place, man.

Fucking ran 38 miles for controller.

3032
02:29:57,540 --> 02:29:58,920
Alter causing Valkyrie.

3033
02:29:59,200 --> 02:30:00,860
Okay, G7, a happy triple take.

3034
02:30:01,720 --> 02:30:02,660
That was what we did last time, right?

3035
02:30:02,740 --> 02:30:03,020
Same shit?

3036
02:30:03,640 --> 02:30:03,880
Yeah.

3037
02:30:05,260 --> 02:30:06,920
That's literally the same shit we have to play.

3038
02:30:08,600 --> 02:30:10,020
They can't remove guns?

3039
02:30:11,180 --> 02:30:11,660
No.

3040
02:30:12,900 --> 02:30:15,240
We just can't pick it up.

3041
02:30:16,200 --> 02:30:18,420
They're like private match settings are absolutely terrible.

3042
02:30:18,520 --> 02:30:20,600
That's like one other thing that Apex just is awful with.

3043
02:30:21,220 --> 02:30:23,520
Can't really do any customization at all in a private match.

3044
02:30:23,820 --> 02:30:24,160
Yeah.

3045
02:30:24,420 --> 02:30:25,000
Pretty ass.

3046
02:30:25,700 --> 02:30:26,560

It left the arena.

There's no auto-play here.

3125
02:34:55,530 --> 02:34:56,390

Oh, hey, look at that.

3138
02:35:14,310 --> 02:35:15,670

Where are we going, Wig?

One sec.

3157
02:36:08,910 --> 02:36:12,610
I had the roasted chatter real quick, so we're just gonna
rotate over to Cascade side real quick.

3158
02:36:13,590 --> 02:36:14,210
Yeah, one sec.

3159
02:36:14,350 --> 02:36:15,150
I gotta put some other place.

3160
02:36:17,030 --> 02:36:18,690
Well, I wanna hear that though.

3161
02:36:19,070 --> 02:36:20,990
Yeah, why did you mute yourself?

3162
02:36:21,070 --> 02:36:22,050
I wanna hear this roast.

3163
02:36:24,190 --> 02:36:24,950
Let us hear.

3164
02:36:25,890 --> 02:36:27,550
I'm mute yourself now, Wig.

3165
02:36:29,830 --> 02:36:32,510
Guys, okay, I got lost in the sauce.

3166
02:36:32,630 --> 02:36:34,030
I forgot to go under or up top.

3167
02:36:34,190 --> 02:36:34,470
Wait, what?

3168
02:36:34,890 --> 02:36:34,890
Wait.

3169
02:36:35,350 --> 02:36:39,230
I went under like after you guys were leaving it.

3170
02:36:40,230 --> 02:36:41,650
Picking up your scrap.

02:36:41,770 --> 02:36:42,150
Yeah, yeah.

3172
02:36:42,430 --> 02:36:43,670
Picking up our trash.

02:36:46,590 --> 02:36:48,030
Oh, this is so bad.

3174
02:36:48,250 --> 02:36:49,490
This is so bad for me.

3175
02:36:49,590 --> 02:36:51,750
The lag is actually so unbearable.

3176
02:36:53,630 --> 02:36:54,610
I have a read-a-play.

3177
02:36:54,750 --> 02:36:55,770
Wait, we have two read-a-plays.

3178
02:36:57,310 --> 02:36:59,090

Oh, oh, my God.

3201
02:39:17,440 --> 02:39:17,880
Don't worry.

3202
02:39:18,260 --> 02:39:18,560
I got it.

3203
02:39:18,560 --> 02:39:21,680
It's made me enter and leave the game, like mid-match,
mid-match.

3204
02:39:21,840 --> 02:39:22,980
Yeah, that was happening to me too.

3205
02:39:23,040 --> 02:39:23,440
That was happening to me.

3206
02:39:23,500 --> 02:39:23,860
That's the lag.

3207
02:39:24,460 --> 02:39:25,120
Oh, it's the lag.

3208
02:39:25,840 --> 02:39:27,180
Yeah, that's the lag talking.

3209
02:39:28,100 --> 02:39:28,760
Oh, respawn.

3210
02:39:28,940 --> 02:39:29,440
Oh, respawn.

3211
02:39:30,760 --> 02:39:31,720
I already have two.

3212
02:39:31,880 --> 02:39:32,320
We have two read.

3213
02:39:32,380 --> 02:39:33,580
I rather we just have a read-a-play.

3214
02:39:33,880 --> 02:39:35,700
If you guys see a repeater, let me know.

3215
02:39:36,220 --> 02:39:37,500
But I've been trying to find one.

3216
02:39:39,500 --> 02:39:42,040
I feel like we get shot at while...

3217
02:39:42,040 --> 02:39:43,520
Yeah, I think this is packet loss.

3218
02:39:44,160 --> 02:39:46,040
My gun is naked.

3219
02:39:46,280 --> 02:39:47,080
We got a naked R9.

3220
02:39:48,160 --> 02:39:48,500
Really?

3221
02:39:48,640 --> 02:39:48,880
Okay.

3222
02:39:50,040 --> 02:39:51,520
I have so much coffee.

3223
02:39:51,520 --> 02:39:53,020
I'll get you dressed up in the second.

3224
02:39:54,320 --> 02:39:56,020
Yeah, yeah, dressed up is good.

3225
02:39:56,980 --> 02:39:57,640
Oh, God.

3226
02:39:57,820 --> 02:39:59,780
Oh, oh, fuck.

there's zero I can't even move.

3231
02:40:33,220 --> 02:40:34,200
I can't even move.

3232
02:40:34,380 --> 02:40:34,900
This sucks.

3233
02:40:35,420 --> 02:40:37,000
I literally can't even move.

3234
02:40:37,660 --> 02:40:38,860
Oh my god.

3235
02:40:38,860 --> 02:40:40,560
Wait, so where do we complain about lag?

3236
02:40:40,960 --> 02:40:43,560
Maybe we can get this game restarted.

3237
02:40:44,080 --> 02:40:44,980
Oh, brother.

3238
02:40:45,840 --> 02:40:47,920
Not a restart to that, man.

3239
02:40:48,160 --> 02:40:52,160
Our entire team died because of lag.

3240
02:40:54,920 --> 02:40:55,660
Literally up pausing.

3241
02:40:55,660 --> 02:40:56,720
Give me another restart.

3242
02:40:56,820 --> 02:40:57,660
Run it up, man.

3243
02:40:57,700 --> 02:40:59,120
Pausing every foot.

3244
02:41:00,880 --> 02:41:02,500
Give it another restart, dude.

3245
02:41:06,440 --> 02:41:08,860
That's such a shame, man.

3246
02:41:10,480 --> 02:41:11,880
Posing non-stop.

3247
02:41:14,280 --> 02:41:15,060
Oh, man.

3248
02:41:15,240 --> 02:41:16,120
That was just so sad.

3249
02:41:22,250 --> 02:41:23,130
That sucks.

3250
02:41:24,150 --> 02:41:27,030
I mean, yeah, I just went into water, then I immediately
started just lagging.

3251
02:41:27,210 --> 02:41:28,170
Me too, yeah.

3252
02:41:28,830 --> 02:41:30,650
Yeah, that's just the worst time possible.

3253
02:41:30,850 --> 02:41:31,150
It's all good.

3254
02:41:31,230 --> 02:41:34,510
I think the last game had easier lagging.

3255
02:41:34,530 --> 02:41:35,690
in this game.

3256
02:41:36,070 --> 02:41:37,190
Yep, yep.

3257
02:41:37,770 --> 02:41:38,130
Definitely last.

3258
02:41:39,530 --> 02:41:40,890
I would say, yeah, probably.

3259
02:41:41,110 --> 02:41:44,610
No, no, this lag was fucking crazy because it hit all three
of us.

3260
02:41:45,810 --> 02:41:50,130
Dude, the wagon that you were getting in this one was where
I have the first three, like, first three games where it's

3261
02:41:50,130 --> 02:41:53,090
like, it take you into the game, out of the game, into the
game, out of the game.

3262
02:41:53,410 --> 02:41:53,770
It's rough.

3263
02:41:54,090 --> 02:41:54,350
Yeah.

3264
02:41:54,410 --> 02:41:54,690
It's rough.

3265
02:41:55,170 --> 02:41:57,930
Now I understand why you were not having fun.

3266
02:41:58,670 --> 02:42:02,050
I was like, bro, I can't, like, because like, I would run
and then pause.

3267
02:42:02,150 --> 02:42:05,230
And I was just like, well, okay, well, just, I don't know if
I'll be alive.

3268
02:42:05,990 --> 02:42:06,390
Like...

3269
02:42:06,590 --> 02:42:08,130
You can't really tell like what's happening.

3270
02:42:08,370 --> 02:42:08,890
It's so bad.

3271
02:42:12,810 --> 02:42:15,470
Also like during that, we were fucked at in that rotation.

3272
02:42:15,670 --> 02:42:17,170
There were teams left, right, in front.

3273
02:42:18,370 --> 02:42:19,430
I literally couldn't go anywhere.

3274
02:42:21,170 --> 02:42:23,090
There's team behind us, team in front of us.

3275
02:42:23,290 --> 02:42:25,570
And then they get a safe rotation right after?

3276
02:42:26,110 --> 02:42:26,470
I know.

3277
02:42:26,570 --> 02:42:27,330
What the fuck is that?

3278
02:42:27,410 --> 02:42:27,670
That sucks.

3279
02:42:27,730 --> 02:42:28,370
They got both of them.

3280
02:42:28,390 --> 02:42:29,650
They got all six of us too.

3281
02:42:29,910 --> 02:42:30,210
Yeah.

3282
02:42:30,450 --> 02:42:31,490
Have you ever seen one of those KP?

3283
02:42:33,090 --> 02:42:34,910
How did he get a free rotation?

3284
02:42:35,670 --> 02:42:38,190
We got sandwiched by three different teams.

3285
02:42:42,280 --> 02:42:42,940
That's crazy.

3286
02:42:43,280 --> 02:42:46,920
They get the restart on the game where we had the best
positioning.

3287
02:42:47,880 --> 02:42:49,520
Dude, our rotation was so good, too.

3288
02:42:49,620 --> 02:42:50,500
We can't think about it, though.

3289
02:42:51,560 --> 02:42:52,660
We just can't think about it, man.

3290
02:42:52,820 --> 02:42:53,440
It is where it is.

3291
02:42:54,960 --> 02:42:56,740
I'm going to become heartbroken the more I think about it.

3292
02:43:01,190 --> 02:43:02,670
Okay, I already shed all my tears.

3293
02:43:02,890 --> 02:43:03,090
I could.

3294
02:43:06,850 --> 02:43:07,630
I'm drained.

3295
02:43:14,550 --> 02:43:16,410
I'm sorry, man, you're not going to get your prize money.

3296
02:43:16,590 --> 02:43:16,910
I apologize.

3297
02:43:18,630 --> 02:43:19,650
This one's on me, dude.

3298
02:43:19,970 --> 02:43:20,910
I owe you like 400 bucks.

3299
02:43:21,150 --> 02:43:24,350
Yeah, you should, you should, you should give some subs real
quick.

3300
02:43:24,750 --> 02:43:25,550
You'd like compensate.

3301
02:43:27,970 --> 02:43:28,950
I was like, I don't care.

3302
02:43:29,050 --> 02:43:30,850
Are you sure it's a free, it's a free win.

3303
02:43:31,010 --> 02:43:31,870
I did not say that.

3304
02:43:31,970 --> 02:43:32,690
I did not say that.

3305
02:43:32,810 --> 02:43:33,670
I was like, do you want to do it this way?

3306
02:43:34,010 --> 02:43:34,790
You said, yes, it's a free win.

3307
02:43:35,190 --> 02:43:37,170
Free W is crazy.

3308
02:43:37,650 --> 02:43:38,470
No, no, no.

3309
02:43:38,470 --> 02:43:39,450
Fake news.

3310
02:43:39,450 --> 02:43:42,430
You can't say that with monsoons in there, man.

3311
02:43:42,890 --> 02:43:43,990
No, no, no.

3312
02:43:44,670 --> 02:43:45,590
Fake news.

3313
02:43:45,850 --> 02:43:48,310
I was like, yo, it's just vibes, bro.

3314
02:43:48,430 --> 02:43:51,610
Like, we have Whig as our third player, and he's like...

3315
02:43:51,610 --> 02:43:53,730
Yeah, I thought it would be vibe for us.

3316
02:43:53,850 --> 02:43:54,970
I thought he'd do all the hard work.

3317
02:43:55,310 --> 02:43:55,690
Oh, yeah.

3318
02:43:55,810 --> 02:43:56,310
I'm sorry.

3319
02:43:56,510 --> 02:43:56,750
I got it.

3320
02:43:56,850 --> 02:43:58,170
It should have been more specific there.

3321
02:43:58,410 --> 02:44:01,350
Yeah, you clear those comms.

3322
02:44:04,050 --> 02:44:07,810
I didn't know Apex servers are now like that bad now.

3323
02:44:08,570 --> 02:44:09,610
That sucks.

3324
02:44:10,650 --> 02:44:11,130
Yeah, dude.

3325
02:44:11,290 --> 02:44:19,330
It's like all creators that want to run like, um, like all
creators want to run like prime matches just can't.

3326
02:44:19,570 --> 02:44:20,630
This is what happens all the time.

3327
02:44:21,470 --> 02:44:22,090
That's crazy.

3328
02:44:22,330 --> 02:44:28,370
Like, dude, like the regular clothes are like regular
lobbies as fuck too, like the casual players?

3329
02:44:30,290 --> 02:44:34,070
If like creator lobbies are this fucked are the regular
lobbies that fuck too?

3330
02:44:34,630 --> 02:44:35,730
Yeah, it's not great, dude.

3331
02:44:36,290 --> 02:44:36,790
Jeez.

3332
02:44:37,670 --> 02:44:38,130
Man.

3333
02:44:38,470 --> 02:44:43,910
I remember back in the day there was no custom lobbies and
you just had to queue up public and see he gets more kills.

3334
02:44:44,410 --> 02:44:45,030
That was it.

3335
02:44:45,310 --> 02:44:48,090
I actually got into a scrim lobby because of that.

3336
02:44:48,670 --> 02:44:55,630
I was like queuing up uh trios with my like trios with my
friend and we got into a scrim lobby with like TSM and like

3337
02:44:55,630 --> 02:44:59,550
like like the when AC was still was cooked then.

3338
02:44:59,690 --> 02:45:05,970
Yeah no it was fun because like it was when AC was still in
pro play and then my friend and I were like wondering why no

3339
02:45:05,970 --> 02:45:14,250
one was dying like no team was dying and we like huddled up
in a house and saw like pro players like pro players in the

3340
02:45:14,250 --> 02:45:24,690
lobby like on the part right we're like oh my god did we
actually get into a stream lobby yeah you're cooked that's

3341
02:45:31,720 --> 02:45:36,710
crazy man when i wanted to restart we don't get it

3342
02:45:40,110 --> 02:45:48,330
this is the third or the fourth round this is the fourth
game so two more games left

3343
02:46:05,130 --> 02:46:20,250
apparently the last game that they restart someone was
actual god spot crazy sucks for them wait this team isn't

3344
02:46:20,250 --> 02:46:23,550
lagging the lag hit this team right now.

3345
02:46:23,670 --> 02:46:24,570
I don't think this is fair.

3346
02:46:24,630 --> 02:46:25,850
Can we, like, lag switch people?

3347
02:46:26,050 --> 02:46:26,830
Yeah, can we lag switch?

3348
02:46:27,030 --> 02:46:30,030
I demand this team to be lagging right now.

3349
02:46:36,100 --> 02:46:38,280
This team does not look like they're lagging.

3350
02:46:38,440 --> 02:46:39,340
I don't like it.

3351
02:46:40,380 --> 02:46:41,320
That makes me mad.

3352
02:46:48,670 --> 02:46:53,270
If I have, if my team has to go through lag, every team has
to go through lag.

3353
02:46:56,570 --> 02:46:57,050
Yep.

3354
02:46:59,650 --> 02:47:05,930
only fair yeah it's only fair we should be able if you kill
a team that's lagging you should get passed with the lag

3355
02:47:05,930 --> 02:47:16,830
like your team also should have the lag too infected yeah
yeah it's like infection yeah get infected with the fucking

3356
02:47:16,830 --> 02:47:21,990
lag there is fair if

3357
02:47:28,060 --> 02:47:31,520
anything every team should be lagging just to make it fair
and balanced.

3358
02:47:33,880 --> 02:47:36,800
Yeah, let's put the servers on like Dubai or something.

3359
02:47:37,200 --> 02:47:40,180
Yeah, we should, okay, oh my god, honestly, that's such a
great idea.

3360
02:47:40,480 --> 02:47:43,480
We should put the server in like the Middle East or
something.

3361
02:47:44,080 --> 02:47:46,180
So everyone should get, should be lagging.

3362
02:47:48,020 --> 02:47:49,940
Just to make it fair to the entire lobby.

3363
02:47:53,040 --> 02:47:56,700
The lag should accumulate and become harder as the game
progresses.

3364
02:47:57,040 --> 02:47:58,160
Now that's entertainment.

3365
02:48:02,020 --> 02:48:04,580
Take the lag and double it to the next person.

3366
02:48:04,900 --> 02:48:05,900
I like that idea.

3367
02:48:23,240 --> 02:48:24,760
Oh my god, there's still 10 teams.

3368
02:48:25,440 --> 02:48:26,080
This is not...

3369
02:48:26,080 --> 02:48:27,860
There's still 10 teams.

3370
02:48:45,290 --> 02:48:45,770
No, guys.

3371
02:48:45,830 --> 02:48:47,630
I mean, I messed up, but no, that sucks, though.

3372
02:48:48,710 --> 02:48:52,130
That really sucks that this tournament is just filled with
lag.

3373
02:48:52,190 --> 02:48:54,330
And it's been hitting my team the most, too.

3374
02:48:57,670 --> 02:49:00,670
Especially, wait, because he's been lagging the last four.

3375
02:49:00,690 --> 02:49:08,770
games as when he started tier 1 player so it's like very
hard as well I

3376
02:49:13,880 --> 02:49:18,240
didn't realize it was that bad now I

3377
02:49:22,970 --> 02:49:32,930
didn't realize yeah like cuz I haven't played these
tournaments in a long time so so I wasn't aware that lags

3378
02:49:32,930 --> 02:49:43,500
have now hit that hard like how like tournament lobbies are
like that now has this been like that wait for all the other

3379
02:49:43,500 --> 02:49:47,940
tournaments like like around the world or is it just n a

3380
02:49:58,930 --> 02:50:00,930
is it just an n a thing

3381
02:50:07,970 --> 02:50:13,250
is jp ones are fine like what the fuck why is n a server so

3382
02:50:20,320 --> 02:50:23,180
why are n a servers like that

3383
02:50:29,730 --> 02:50:38,430
that's unlucky i know this team was worse so for vibes but
it does suck it really does suck to die to to like like

3384
02:50:38,430 --> 02:50:38,850
that.

3385
02:50:39,690 --> 02:50:43,730
But it's like, we don't even have, like, I felt like we've
never had a real fight, dude.

3386
02:50:44,090 --> 02:50:45,490
I think that's what's frustrating.

3387
02:50:46,010 --> 02:50:51,850
Like, my team has not had a single real fight because of how
bad the lag is.

3388
02:50:53,150 --> 02:51:00,730
Because I think if all of us had, like, decent ping, or,
like, we'd actually have, you know, have, like, I want to

3389
02:51:00,730 --> 02:51:01,470
have a real fight.

3390
02:51:01,590 --> 02:51:03,690
It's not fun when I don't even get to shoot my gun.

3391
02:51:05,130 --> 02:51:07,130
There's no chance to actually play the game.

3392
02:51:08,270 --> 02:51:14,410
Yeah, I don't think I don't know I know I want to do
tournaments In the future if it's like this and then it's

3393
02:51:14,410 --> 02:51:19,750
but I don't know about do any tournaments if it's like this
And this might be my last one until they fixed the issue

3394
02:51:19,750 --> 02:51:25,750
because it's definitely not fun And you know I feel bad
because I invited wig and moxie to join me too And I don't

3395
02:51:25,750 --> 02:51:34,550
want them to have like, you know, this was my invite to them
to play with me And I don't want to like have them have a

3396
02:51:34,550 --> 02:51:43,830
bad time dude because of my invite Yeah, I know, like, oh, I
didn't restart when we are, we're, I wish they restarted

3397
02:51:43,830 --> 02:51:44,470
this one.

3398
02:51:44,710 --> 02:51:47,610
Like this, if we had a game like this one, then they
restarted.

3399
02:51:49,230 --> 02:51:57,130
Like, all the other, like, we had so many terrible lag
games, and then, like, um, this is the one that we were okay

3400
02:51:57,130 --> 02:51:59,430
in was the one that got restarted.

3401
02:52:06,350 --> 02:52:07,890
No one expected this, yeah.

3402
02:52:08,230 --> 02:52:15,430
But apparently, people are now, people are saying that it's
been like this for, uh, um it's been like this for uh for a

3403
02:52:15,430 --> 02:52:27,920
while now i haven't been keeping up to date so i didn't know
it was like this yeah no i'm glad moxie and wig are my team

3404
02:52:27,920 --> 02:52:33,880
because they're really fun people to play with i just wish i
could have given them a better experience you know because

3405
02:52:33,880 --> 02:52:45,580
it was my invite and also i could have gone to the dentist i
think this over the dentist because i was just So I

3406
02:52:45,580 --> 02:52:49,280
literally called today and they're like, yeah, the only
appointment we could get you.

3407
02:52:49,380 --> 02:52:51,540
Like I called the emergency dentist today.

3408
02:52:52,260 --> 02:53:00,680
But it's been like, I'm like not like, like the gum is
obviously swollen in the part where like.

3409
02:53:02,420 --> 02:53:03,980
And it's been very annoying today.

3410
02:53:04,100 --> 02:53:05,480
Today has been extra annoying.

3411
02:53:07,680 --> 02:53:10,460
So today's been like really, really bad.

3412
02:53:10,660 --> 02:53:11,360
I mean, not bad.

3413
02:53:11,480 --> 02:53:12,100
It's not painful.

3414
02:53:12,260 --> 02:53:12,580
That's the thing.

3415
02:53:12,680 --> 02:53:13,620
It's not painful.

3416
02:53:15,340 --> 02:53:24,080
obviously the gum is swollen so it's so I'm like I like it
was so annoying to me so I was like thinking like oh I could

3417
02:53:24,080 --> 02:53:32,280
still eat solid food it's like my top left job I was like
they're like the only appointment we can get you today at

3418
02:53:32,280 --> 02:53:36,640
the emergency dentist is literally 12 p.m.

3419
02:53:37,040 --> 02:53:41,900
and then and I was like oh fuck okay

3420
02:53:45,320 --> 02:53:49,280
pick apex because I didn't want to back out like the last 30
minutes.

3421
02:53:49,400 --> 02:53:50,620
Like the tournament was going to start in 30 minutes.

3422
02:53:50,760 --> 02:53:51,440
I was like, I'm not back.

3423
02:53:51,480 --> 02:53:53,660
I don't want to back out like that last minute.

3424
02:53:54,020 --> 02:53:56,380
But I like, and I was like, you know, I'll tank it.

3425
02:53:56,460 --> 02:53:57,500
I'll tank it until Monday.

3426
02:54:11,240 --> 02:54:11,680
It's just swollen.

3427
02:54:11,780 --> 02:54:12,880
I can feel it swollen.

3428
02:54:13,320 --> 02:54:15,620
Because I'm trying to talk, but I feel that swollen gum.

3429
02:54:17,280 --> 02:54:17,480
Yeah.

3430
02:54:18,080 --> 02:54:19,520
Yeah, I didn't want to do them like that.

3431
02:54:19,720 --> 02:54:20,760
So I was just like, I'm already.

3432
02:54:20,940 --> 02:54:21,820
I mean, fuck.

3433
02:54:23,320 --> 02:54:23,620
All right.

3434
02:54:23,740 --> 02:54:25,100
Well, this sang guy's good.

3435
02:54:25,940 --> 02:54:26,500
That was good, man.

3436
02:54:26,640 --> 02:54:27,180
He's pro.

3437
02:54:28,200 --> 02:54:31,020
One of the best ballistic players in the world, if not the
best.

3438
02:54:31,760 --> 02:54:31,920
Damn.

3439
02:54:32,740 --> 02:54:34,200
Didn't even know that was his name.

3440
02:54:34,320 --> 02:54:35,120
I thought it was Fuse.

3441
02:54:40,040 --> 02:54:40,360
Sheesh.

3442
02:54:40,700 --> 02:54:42,040
I didn't even know that character existed.

3443
02:54:42,340 --> 02:54:42,660
Ballistic.

3444
02:54:43,280 --> 02:54:43,600
Sheesh.

3445
02:54:43,600 --> 02:54:44,280
He's good, man.

3446
02:54:44,600 --> 02:54:45,020
He's real good.

3447
02:54:54,540 --> 02:54:58,260
I feel like we should just change the server to, like, the
Middle East.

3448
02:54:59,100 --> 02:55:00,480
So everyone will start lagging.

3449
02:55:01,220 --> 02:55:01,460
Yeah, yeah.

3450
02:55:02,320 --> 02:55:03,620
Yeah, we should just go to Dubai.

3451
02:55:03,640 --> 02:55:06,400
I get the Bahrain server going in this game.

3452
02:55:06,520 --> 02:55:06,860
We're not good.

3453
02:55:07,200 --> 02:55:07,360
Yeah.

3454
02:55:07,720 --> 02:55:07,720
Yeah.

3455
02:55:08,360 --> 02:55:14,060
Suggest that wait don't listen to you You should put that in
the suggestion Yeah, they'll listen to the uh last place

3456
02:55:14,060 --> 02:55:14,320
squad.

3457
02:55:14,420 --> 02:55:15,580
I think they would dude low key.

3458
02:55:15,860 --> 02:55:23,720
Yeah Yeah, I mean we have the highest chance to be fair We
are the only reason why we're plays that low is because the

3459
02:55:23,720 --> 02:55:30,340
servers have been fucking us Specifically our team Yeah,
I've yet to play a game without lag which is really just

3460
02:55:30,340 --> 02:55:31,480
devastating to be honest.

3461
02:55:32,100 --> 02:55:36,320
Yeah, so So, technically, we have an excuse.

3462
02:55:36,360 --> 02:55:36,980
It does make me sad.

3463
02:55:37,600 --> 02:55:38,980
Makes me pretty goddamn sad.

3464
02:55:40,420 --> 02:55:44,100
It's like teams that are below us, unless they're also
lagging.

3465
02:55:44,460 --> 02:55:46,620
If you're a team that is not lagging.

3466
02:55:48,860 --> 02:55:49,880
They're not fuckers, dude.

3467
02:55:49,920 --> 02:55:51,060
If you're not lagging, bro, fuck them.

3468
02:55:51,240 --> 02:55:51,540
Yeah.

3469
02:55:51,960 --> 02:55:53,040
You're not lagging.

3470
02:55:53,520 --> 02:55:54,720
Your opinion is invalid.

3471
02:55:56,420 --> 02:55:57,360
You're spitting off that one, dude.

3472
02:55:57,540 --> 02:55:58,120
Talk your shit.

3473
02:55:58,620 --> 02:55:58,900
Exactly.

3474
02:55:59,300 --> 02:56:01,520
If you're not below us, you're also opinion is invalid.

3475
02:56:01,700 --> 02:56:02,040
Yeah.

3476
02:56:02,700 --> 02:56:11,720
place are we probably very far last for sure we're 14th
right now oh wow honestly we have one good game how are we

3477
02:56:11,720 --> 02:56:19,220
14 like i think i think the other teams below us is also
lagging really badly they have to be bro we've done nothing

3478
02:56:19,220 --> 02:56:27,420
we've outgone like five times we scored two points in four
rounds here god damn genus yeah we got two kills in total

3479
02:56:27,420 --> 02:56:30,360
yeah they're lucky this is a marvel rivals

3480
02:56:34,020 --> 02:56:41,560
they're lucky dude oh people are saying the people that
aren't lagging are the ones that are like top five i wonder

3481
02:56:41,560 --> 02:56:49,200
like what they're doing where they're at why is it not
targeting them like i got nowhere i got the worst luck in

3482
02:56:49,200 --> 02:56:59,560
these fucking lobbies always it's probably my fault to be
honest that's crazy it's definitely your fault facts agree

3483
02:56:59,560 --> 02:57:07,500
dude they're literally like it's like taking the blame i
wasted no i feel everyone six games in a row it's like

3484
02:57:07,500 --> 02:57:12,320
they're like they're like it's like they're hunters or
something they're like going on a hunting trip and we're the

3485
02:57:12,320 --> 02:57:23,360
prey because we're lagging i mean i'm so desperate not to
lag i just changed my resolution for no reason come on yeah

3486
02:57:23,360 --> 02:57:29,300
maybe this will fix it oh they're just gonna fix it oh wait

All right.

3489
02:57:33,760 --> 02:57:35,000
I guess I played Lifeline.

02:57:36,060 --> 02:57:36,460
Have fun.

3491
02:57:36,600 --> 02:57:36,920
You've learned.

3492
02:57:37,540 --> 02:57:39,620
Bro, I barely even played the character.

3493
02:57:41,960 --> 02:57:43,760
I got you guys the lobby code.

3494
02:57:44,680 --> 02:57:44,940
All right.

3495
02:57:45,460 --> 02:57:46,940
How many of those bad boys are in there?

3496
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:47,300
A lot of them?

3497
02:57:47,640 --> 02:57:48,020
I don't know.

3498
02:57:48,100 --> 02:57:49,020
I just got it.

3499
02:57:49,540 --> 02:57:50,160
Oh, damn.

3500
02:57:50,800 --> 02:57:52,280
I just got the code.

3501
02:57:52,500 --> 02:57:54,480
I didn't even join in the code.

3502
02:57:55,400 --> 02:57:55,980
Sassy, dude.

3503
02:57:56,160 --> 02:57:56,600
Hates me.

3504
02:57:57,000 --> 02:57:58,120
Yeah, I'm right.

3505
02:57:58,560 --> 02:58:00,060
Yeah, it's crazy.

3506
02:58:01,420 --> 02:58:03,440
The one's like, no, my bad.

3507
02:58:04,340 --> 02:58:05,220
Yeah, I own it.

3508
02:58:05,800 --> 02:58:07,160
See, that's what you know, I'm not fake.

3509
02:58:09,740 --> 02:58:11,080
I'm not fake, though.

3510
02:58:12,120 --> 02:58:12,520
Facts.

3511
02:58:12,960 --> 02:58:14,100
I'm real to you.

3512
02:58:14,700 --> 02:58:15,780
Yeah, you mad real, though.

3513
02:58:16,120 --> 02:58:16,360
Yeah.

3514
02:58:16,960 --> 02:58:18,080
I'm a real homie.

3515
02:58:18,180 --> 02:58:19,760
I tell it how it is.

3516
02:58:23,340 --> 02:58:28,260
Look, I know you're real, but it's just, to me, it's so
funny that I, like, don't know what you look like.

3517
02:58:28,280 --> 02:58:29,180
And you're like, I'm real.

3518
02:58:29,320 --> 02:58:32,840
I'm like, dude, I know you are, but I don't.

3519
02:58:33,200 --> 02:58:33,840
I just...

3520
02:58:33,840 --> 02:58:34,840
That's what I look like.

3521
02:58:36,740 --> 02:58:38,120
Bro, it's not my fault.

3522
02:58:38,180 --> 02:58:40,340
You're so fucking busy in Japan there.

3523
02:58:41,120 --> 02:58:41,820
I know, dude.

3524
02:58:41,920 --> 02:58:42,720
Fuck, that was awful.

3525
02:58:42,960 --> 02:58:44,380
Dude, I don't get to hang out like ever.

3526
02:58:44,620 --> 02:58:48,500
I tried to meet up with you and you were like, oh, bro, I
can't.

3527
02:58:49,500 --> 02:58:50,820
Well, what goes on in Japan?

3528
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:53,400
No, it was the part, like, there was a land in Japan.

3529
02:58:54,200 --> 02:58:54,820
Oh, shit.

3530
02:58:54,900 --> 02:58:55,260
Yeah.

3531
02:58:55,300 --> 02:58:56,640
Yeah, it was so fun, dude.

3532
02:58:56,760 --> 02:58:57,280
That was a good land.

3533
02:58:58,540 --> 02:58:59,440
Are you going to get it now?

3534
02:59:00,980 --> 02:59:01,200
Fair.

3535
02:59:01,500 --> 02:59:01,740
No.

3536
02:59:01,960 --> 02:59:03,580
Why is Apex so big in Japan?

3537
02:59:05,100 --> 02:59:10,680
It released like, so one of the main reasons was just
literally the PlayStation, dude.

3538
02:59:10,880 --> 02:59:13,140
Like right when it was released on PlayStation, it just took
the fuck off.

3539
02:59:13,780 --> 02:59:14,300
It was insane.

3540
02:59:15,120 --> 02:59:22,840
It was basically became the number one game for 2023, and I
think on PlayStation in Japan.

3541
02:59:23,040 --> 02:59:25,740
It was also the first shooter that got popular in Japan.

3542
02:59:26,440 --> 02:59:32,340
Like the first actual competitive, like, FPS game because
like in the past they never were into combat like shooters

3543
02:59:32,340 --> 02:59:42,760
like even like you know they have a Overwatch team for Japan
but like it wasn't as big as what Apex became I think the

3544
02:59:42,760 --> 02:59:47,920
closest would be I think the closest would be Valorant man
Valorant's fucking huge there too yeah it's getting bigger

3545
02:59:47,920 --> 02:59:55,880
and bigger but but like it was Apex first and then Valorant
yeah no Apex for sure yeah but now Valorant is more popular

3546
02:59:55,880 --> 02:59:59,180
than Apex I think in Japan I don't know, dude.

3547
02:59:59,380 --> 02:59:59,720
It's crazy.

3548
02:59:59,860 --> 03:00:04,820
The amount of people that are like, yeah, maybe like by a
player count, but the amount of like famous people in Japan,

3549
03:00:04,980 --> 03:00:08,440
like big names, like J-pop artists and shit that play Apex
is nuts.

3550
03:00:09,340 --> 03:00:10,280
It's like insane.

3551
03:00:12,480 --> 03:00:12,540
Nuddy.

3552
03:00:12,940 --> 03:00:14,860
I think it's just, it's because it's more fast pace.

3553
03:00:15,380 --> 03:00:17,100
He has Valorant just way too fucking slow.

3554
03:00:18,140 --> 03:00:20,360
And a lot of people like in Japan just play like Sony.

3555
03:00:20,500 --> 03:00:21,640
It's like their main thing there.

3556
03:00:21,900 --> 03:00:23,660
So like Roller on Apex is also just so good.

3557
03:00:24,120 --> 03:00:26,080
You can't really play Roller on Valorant.

3558
03:00:26,300 --> 03:00:27,060
Valorant, you can.

3559
03:00:27,240 --> 03:00:27,320
Exactly.

3560
03:00:28,660 --> 03:00:30,060
Yeah, it's so hard, dude.

3561
03:00:30,220 --> 03:00:31,140
You can't do it.

3562
03:00:32,300 --> 03:00:32,700
Wait, wait, wait.

3563
03:00:32,840 --> 03:00:36,180
Oh, so that's why it's because Sony, every Japanese...

3564
03:00:36,180 --> 03:00:36,780
Oh, okay.

3565
03:00:36,900 --> 03:00:37,860
Every Japanese player.

3566
03:00:38,560 --> 03:00:42,800
A lot of, like, a professional play, too, for Japan,
majority of them are control players.

3567
03:00:44,480 --> 03:00:46,400
And then South Korea has, like, zero.

3568
03:00:46,580 --> 03:00:47,780
Literally no control players that play.

3569
03:00:48,340 --> 03:00:48,700
Yeah.

3570
03:00:48,880 --> 03:00:50,720
Because they're all, like, M&K, purists.

3571
03:00:51,480 --> 03:00:52,120
They hate us.

3572
03:00:52,200 --> 03:00:52,960
Like, they actually hate us.

3573
03:00:53,540 --> 03:00:54,720
I would die to, like...

3574
03:00:55,320 --> 03:00:56,740
I would die to show...

3575
03:00:58,840 --> 03:00:59,720
Don't worry, Wig.

3576
03:01:00,200 --> 03:01:00,820
I also hate.

3577
03:01:00,820 --> 03:01:01,240
God damn it, dude.

3578
03:01:01,520 --> 03:01:02,100
That's good.

3579
03:01:03,980 --> 03:01:08,160
I would die to like frozen South from South Korea and ranked
at like 4 a.m.

3580
03:01:08,180 --> 03:01:10,180
their time and they would just shoot my body for like five
hours.

3581
03:01:11,680 --> 03:01:13,060
Are you sure it's not me?

3582
03:01:13,340 --> 03:01:13,580
So long.

3583
03:01:13,700 --> 03:01:14,080
Are you sure?

3584
03:01:14,260 --> 03:01:14,740
Yeah, I'm sure.

3585
03:01:14,920 --> 03:01:15,980
Like I'm like shoot.

3586
03:01:16,140 --> 03:01:17,800
So you that was actually me.

3587
03:01:19,800 --> 03:01:20,140
I would.

3588
03:01:20,220 --> 03:01:21,000
You would shoot my body.

3589
03:01:21,040 --> 03:01:22,040
I would actually.

3590
03:01:22,180 --> 03:01:23,060
I should do that one day.

3591
03:01:23,200 --> 03:01:25,580
Remember we tortured nocturnal for like seven hours and
ranked us so far?

3592
03:01:26,840 --> 03:01:27,220
Oh, yeah.

3593
03:01:27,260 --> 03:01:27,820
It's like, I'm at.

3594
03:01:28,500 --> 03:01:30,980
What was that story I was trying to tell you?

3595
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:32,400
The blue school is saying.

3596
03:01:32,460 --> 03:01:33,480
Blue school is story.

3597
03:01:33,660 --> 03:01:34,660
How the fuck did we even get there?

3598
03:01:34,800 --> 03:01:35,480
I don't know that at all.

3599
03:01:37,560 --> 03:01:38,180
Oh, what a time.

3600
03:01:38,260 --> 03:01:38,500
All right.

3601
03:01:39,780 --> 03:01:40,500
Resolutions changed.

3602
03:01:40,780 --> 03:01:41,800
That means no lag.

3603
03:01:41,880 --> 03:01:42,540
Let's get locked in.

3604
03:01:42,740 --> 03:01:43,920
I don't think that's how it works.

3605
03:01:45,240 --> 03:01:45,660
No, it is.

3606
03:01:47,120 --> 03:01:47,740
Oh, yeah.

3607
03:01:47,740 --> 03:01:47,900
So apparently.

3608
03:01:47,900 --> 03:01:48,880
We just got a rebirth here.

3609
03:01:48,980 --> 03:01:49,220
Come on.

3610
03:01:49,640 --> 03:01:49,900
Uh-oh.

3611
03:01:50,980 --> 03:01:51,740
We got a rebirth.

3612
03:01:51,920 --> 03:01:52,220
Come on.

3613
03:01:52,900 --> 03:01:53,560
Lock on in.

3614
03:01:55,600 --> 03:01:57,800
We decided who spawned.

3615
03:01:57,820 --> 03:02:06,760
where um i don't know doki how do you decide that what oh

3618
03:02:22,760 --> 03:02:24,780
lifeline wait where's life you want to do that

3619

Bro, let's try to get Pred again together.

3621
03:02:34,720 --> 03:02:37,580

Holy fuck, imagine the ground we go on, that'd be electric.

3628
03:02:54,560 --> 03:02:57,720
Bro, imagine the stream snipers there to fuck us over.

3629
03:02:58,700 --> 03:03:00,720
No, I thought Moxie's stream snipers were friendly.

3630
03:03:00,800 --> 03:03:01,260
Oh, true.

3631
03:03:01,700 --> 03:03:03,440
Oh, my God, your stream snipers will feed us kills.

3632
03:03:05,080 --> 03:03:05,520
Oh, yeah.

3633
03:03:06,200 --> 03:03:09,000
Yeah, the land on us and give us, like, 20 Kp.

3634
03:03:10,800 --> 03:03:11,420
I'm going to go inside.

3635
03:03:11,600 --> 03:03:12,280
We get bad for that.

3636
03:03:13,900 --> 03:03:14,260
100%.

3637
03:03:14,260 --> 03:03:15,200
We definitely get bad.

3638
03:03:15,440 --> 03:03:16,860
Okay, but, like, we're not.

3639
03:03:16,960 --> 03:03:20,220
This only happened before ranked was even a thing.

3640
03:03:20,320 --> 03:03:21,440
That's why I got all these kills.

3641
03:03:22,000 --> 03:03:22,720
Oh, I see.

3642
03:03:22,720 --> 03:03:25,180
Okay, so we could just say, like, guys, don't do that.

3643
03:03:25,540 --> 03:03:27,640
But, like, we can't stop you.

3644
03:03:27,820 --> 03:03:29,420
You do want to land on us.

3645
03:03:30,100 --> 03:03:31,080
Also, I didn't see the gun ban.

3646
03:03:31,220 --> 03:03:32,060
What was the gun ban?

3647
03:03:32,720 --> 03:03:34,060
I have no idea either.

3648
03:03:34,280 --> 03:03:35,080
Also, I'm not lagging.

3649
03:03:35,280 --> 03:03:36,120
Did I define the fucking meta?

3650
03:03:37,260 --> 03:03:39,920
I am the one that got hit, but I'm not pausing.

3651
03:03:40,440 --> 03:03:42,300
The G7 scout is bad.

3652
03:03:42,300 --> 03:03:42,780
I'm not even.

3653
03:03:43,380 --> 03:03:43,580
Okay.

3654
03:03:45,040 --> 03:03:47,840
Well, no, it's been bad, but I have no idea what the new one
is.

3655
03:03:47,980 --> 03:03:49,000
Guys, what's the gun ban?

3656
03:03:49,120 --> 03:03:50,640
Does anyone know what the gun bans are?

3657
03:03:50,720 --> 03:03:51,760
Because I was not reading the chat.

3658
03:03:52,700 --> 03:03:53,280
Are you paying attention?

3659
03:03:53,380 --> 03:03:53,880
Chat, please.

3660
03:03:54,140 --> 03:03:54,460
Chat, chat.

3661
03:03:54,460 --> 03:03:55,480
Was that the battle fight?

3662
03:03:55,760 --> 03:03:56,220
Oh, apparently.

3663
03:03:56,360 --> 03:03:57,800
No, it's like, it was in chat.

3664
03:03:57,820 --> 03:03:59,040
Oh, it's Mozambique.

3665
03:03:59,220 --> 03:04:00,000

3666
03:04:00,160 --> 03:04:01,300
Oh, I guess double Mozambique.

3667
03:04:01,480 --> 03:04:01,920
Here's a sniper.

3668
03:04:02,960 --> 03:04:05,640
I think zones go in north pad like right next to us though,
by the way.

3669
03:04:05,980 --> 03:04:05,980
So.

3670

3672
03:04:08,460 --> 03:04:08,880
No, it's good.

3673
03:04:09,020 --> 03:04:10,120

I just need you to know you almost killed me when you're
all.

3831
03:12:01,460 --> 03:12:02,640
No, no, no.

3832
03:12:03,320 --> 03:12:03,680
Calculated.

3833
03:12:04,100 --> 03:12:06,280
You almost killed me when you're all broken.

3834
03:12:06,480 --> 03:12:07,460
Gonna be honest, guys.

3835
03:12:07,620 --> 03:12:09,980
I was about to run away immediately when you died.

3836
03:12:10,400 --> 03:12:11,500
I was about to run away immediately.

3837
03:12:11,600 --> 03:12:12,620
But I believe in you guys, bro.

3838
03:12:12,700 --> 03:12:13,320
I believe in you guys.

3839
03:12:13,720 --> 03:12:14,160
Oh, my God.

3840
03:12:14,200 --> 03:12:15,460
We actually had a fight.

3841
03:12:15,580 --> 03:12:16,440
I'm so happy.

3842
03:12:17,060 --> 03:12:17,740
Wait, guys, I was watching.

3843
03:12:17,740 --> 03:12:17,880
Oh, my God.

3844
03:12:17,940 --> 03:12:18,560
Moxie died.

3845
03:12:18,740 --> 03:12:19,860
Moxie knocked was a bait.

3846
03:12:20,040 --> 03:12:20,740
That was a bait.

3847
03:12:21,320 --> 03:12:23,080
You should have seen how I played that with 10.

3848
03:12:23,080 --> 03:12:23,920
I did no damage.

3849
03:12:23,920 --> 03:12:24,340
Good job.

3850
03:12:24,560 --> 03:12:26,960
Like, this guy was so scared to push me when I had 1-8 feet.

3851
03:12:28,040 --> 03:12:28,980
It was insane.

3852
03:12:29,020 --> 03:12:29,540
You were a good bait.

3853
03:12:29,560 --> 03:12:30,140
You were a good bait.

3854
03:12:31,140 --> 03:12:31,460
Confidence.

3855
03:12:31,900 --> 03:12:32,860
We're going to move up near me.

3856
03:12:33,360 --> 03:12:34,200
Just keep doing that, guys.

3857
03:12:34,360 --> 03:12:34,920
Keep baiting me.

3858
03:12:35,360 --> 03:12:35,440
Yep.

3859
03:12:35,680 --> 03:12:36,040
Got you, baby.

3860
03:12:37,220 --> 03:12:38,540
How do we win that on white armor as well?

3861
03:12:38,560 --> 03:12:39,120
I don't know.

3862
03:12:39,340 --> 03:12:40,400
I have no idea.

3863
03:12:40,540 --> 03:12:41,040
That was crazy.

3864
03:12:41,360 --> 03:12:43,140
Wait, ring consoles or surveys?

3865
03:12:44,160 --> 03:12:45,180
Oh, right now it doesn't really matter.

3866
03:12:45,280 --> 03:12:47,100
I would do rings, but I don't even know if we're going to
hit one for you anyway.

3867
03:12:47,760 --> 03:12:48,640
Just keep it up.

3868
03:12:48,700 --> 03:12:49,200
Just keep this.

3869
03:12:49,260 --> 03:12:50,500
Don't take anything yet.

3870
03:12:50,680 --> 03:12:52,040
Oh, no, we're going to take it.

3871
03:12:52,420 --> 03:12:53,340
We're going to play it.

3872
03:12:54,120 --> 03:12:54,560
That's okay.

3873
03:12:54,620 --> 03:12:55,740
That's actually the smart move.

3874
03:12:56,320 --> 03:12:56,700
We're good.

3875
03:12:56,900 --> 03:12:59,140
We're also, we're going to stay underneath here for a little
while.

3876
03:12:59,300 --> 03:13:00,480
I got all three kills.

3877
03:13:00,640 --> 03:13:01,680
So we got three points.

3878
03:13:02,140 --> 03:13:02,840
Oh my God.

3879
03:13:03,020 --> 03:13:03,460
Let's fucking go.

3880
03:13:03,900 --> 03:13:04,180
That's good.

3881
03:13:04,240 --> 03:13:04,500
That's good.

3882
03:13:05,120 --> 03:13:06,000
That's huge, bro.

3883
03:13:06,100 --> 03:13:06,520
That's huge.

3884
03:13:06,760 --> 03:13:07,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3885
03:13:07,400 --> 03:13:08,420
We're going to play you for a little bit.

3886
03:13:08,600 --> 03:13:09,540
Only 13 squads up.

3887
03:13:09,560 --> 03:13:10,280
This is really good.

3888
03:13:10,480 --> 03:13:11,680
Like really good at two or nine.

3889
03:13:12,620 --> 03:13:14,680
I love that the one game we're lagging.

3890
03:13:14,840 --> 03:13:15,340
We're not lagging.

3891
03:13:15,520 --> 03:13:16,760
There's no one alive, but it's kill.

3892
03:13:16,800 --> 03:13:17,160
It's all good.

3893
03:13:17,360 --> 03:13:17,400
Don't worry.

3894
03:13:17,420 --> 03:13:18,000
That's good.

3895
03:13:18,120 --> 03:13:18,260
That's good.

3896
03:13:18,400 --> 03:13:20,820
We got placement points too.

3897
03:13:21,160 --> 03:13:21,400
True.

3898
03:13:22,880 --> 03:13:23,200
100%.

3899
03:13:23,200 --> 03:13:23,600
All right.

3900
03:13:23,680 --> 03:13:24,420
You guys stay here.

3901
03:13:24,500 --> 03:13:25,180
I'm going to do some recon.

3902
03:13:25,440 --> 03:13:26,160
Just don't die on me.

3903
03:13:26,380 --> 03:13:27,280
And I will die on you, maybe.

3904
03:13:28,320 --> 03:13:28,640
Okay.

3905
03:13:30,680 --> 03:13:31,000
Okay.

3906
03:13:32,780 --> 03:13:33,840
All right, so there's a team over here.

3907
03:13:34,540 --> 03:13:36,660
All right, we're gonna do, we're gonna fight those guys
later.

3908
03:13:36,720 --> 03:13:38,160
We're gonna fight them later once the zone closes.

3909
03:13:39,040 --> 03:13:40,700
That's the first team we're gonna fight in gazebo.

3910
03:13:40,880 --> 03:13:42,120
Is anyone scouting behind us?

3911
03:13:42,900 --> 03:13:46,020
I think we're good for right now, because I think everyone
that was behind us moved in, but we'll see.

3912
03:13:46,160 --> 03:13:47,660
Just keep watching behind on the northeast side.

3913
03:13:48,180 --> 03:13:48,460
Should be cool.

3914
03:13:49,020 --> 03:13:50,340
Great fight though, dude.

Okay, yeah.

3969
03:16:32,800 --> 03:16:34,480

I'm 20 on my alt.

3971
03:16:38,080 --> 03:16:39,260
I'm going to look behind us.

3972
03:16:40,080 --> 03:16:40,660
50 now.

3973
03:16:40,860 --> 03:16:41,860
I scanned the care package.

3974
03:16:42,540 --> 03:16:42,740
Nice.

3975
03:16:42,900 --> 03:16:43,260
Good scan.

3976
03:16:43,760 --> 03:16:44,360
It's a car.

3977
03:16:44,740 --> 03:16:44,920
I'm bad.

3978
03:16:46,300 --> 03:16:46,660
All right.

3979
03:16:46,720 --> 03:16:46,900
All good.

3980
03:16:47,000 --> 03:16:47,140
I'm good.

3981
03:16:47,360 --> 03:16:47,460
I'm good.

3982
03:16:47,460 --> 03:16:48,120
I'm just looking here.

3983
03:16:48,280 --> 03:16:48,540
Just in case.

3984
03:16:48,820 --> 03:16:49,640
What are the people above us?

3985
03:16:49,760 --> 03:16:49,960
Do we?

3986
03:16:50,380 --> 03:16:50,780
That's fine.

3987
03:16:50,880 --> 03:16:52,680
If there's someone above us, just try to ignore it.

3988
03:16:52,980 --> 03:16:54,620
Just try not to just try to analyze it as much as possible.

3989
03:16:55,140 --> 03:16:55,680
Yeah, here.

3990
03:16:55,820 --> 03:16:57,000
Northwest side, 285.

3991
03:16:58,840 --> 03:16:59,600
It's a charge rifle.

3992
03:16:59,700 --> 03:16:59,940
So watch out.

3993
03:17:00,020 --> 03:17:00,640
We're still in zone.

3994
03:17:00,840 --> 03:17:01,040
We're on that.

3995
03:17:01,160 --> 03:17:01,460
We're fine.

3996
03:17:01,640 --> 03:17:01,680
Yeah.

3997
03:17:01,840 --> 03:17:02,520
I'm looking here.

3998
03:17:02,780 --> 03:17:03,920
There's a team in this cup.

3999
03:17:03,980 --> 03:17:04,780
There's a team in this hole.

4000
03:17:04,820 --> 03:17:05,020
Yep.

4001
03:17:06,680 --> 03:17:07,640
Keep standing on that, Doki, if you can.

4002
03:17:07,700 --> 03:17:09,680
Just keep putting pressure on him.

4003
03:17:11,420 --> 03:17:11,840
Try it.

4004
03:17:12,200 --> 03:17:12,980
Don't pick me, pussy.

4005
03:17:13,580 --> 03:17:13,900
Yeah.

4006
03:17:14,080 --> 03:17:15,280
Let him know.

4007
03:17:15,540 --> 03:17:16,620
Let him know, dog.

4008
03:17:16,980 --> 03:17:17,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4009
03:17:17,900 --> 03:17:18,780
Let him know.

4010
03:17:19,360 --> 03:17:19,900
Hit him again.

4011
03:17:20,060 --> 03:17:20,380
65.

4012
03:17:20,660 --> 03:17:21,520
Oh, my God.

4013
03:17:21,720 --> 03:17:21,940
It's okay.

4014
03:17:22,040 --> 03:17:22,160
It's here.

4015
03:17:22,340 --> 03:17:22,700
You're good.

4016
03:17:22,700 --> 03:17:22,920
You're good.

4017
03:17:22,960 --> 03:17:23,080
You're good.

4018
03:17:28,140 --> 03:17:28,780
I'm dead.

4019
03:17:28,880 --> 03:17:29,000
I'm dead.

4020
03:17:29,980 --> 03:17:30,300
I'm dead.

4021
03:17:30,300 --> 03:17:30,380
Oh, they can't.

4022
03:17:31,040 --> 03:17:32,760
They walked all the way behind.

4023
03:17:33,160 --> 03:17:33,360
They're good.

4024
03:17:34,000 --> 03:17:34,540
Keep moving up.

4025
03:17:34,580 --> 03:17:34,800
Keep going.

4026
03:17:35,100 --> 03:17:35,100
Keep going.

4027
03:17:35,660 --> 03:17:36,220
Keep going.

4028
03:17:37,480 --> 03:17:38,760
No, they're going to kill me now.

4029
03:17:39,060 --> 03:17:40,160
They're not pushing it.

4030
03:17:40,340 --> 03:17:41,000
Oh, I might be dead.

4031
03:17:41,200 --> 03:17:42,800
No, they're gonna keep moving.

4032
03:17:42,920 --> 03:17:43,300
Keep them back.

4033
03:17:43,380 --> 03:17:43,680
Keep them back.

4034
03:17:43,780 --> 03:17:44,440
They're taking a zip right now.

4035
03:17:45,580 --> 03:17:46,680
Just play for your life.

4036
03:17:47,780 --> 03:17:48,500
Yeah, run, run, run, run, run.

4037
03:17:48,800 --> 03:17:49,240
I'm dead.

4038
03:17:49,580 --> 03:17:49,680
I'm dead.

4039
03:17:49,860 --> 03:17:50,260
Go forward.

4040
03:17:50,380 --> 03:17:51,020
Go forward if you can.

4041
03:17:51,460 --> 03:17:53,000
My zip fucking didn't do shit.

4042
03:17:54,760 --> 03:17:55,220
I'm dead.

4043
03:17:55,600 --> 03:17:56,120
I'm dead.

4044
03:17:57,020 --> 03:18:03,840

4048
03:18:31,860 --> 03:18:33,480
It's like nowhere for me to play this.

4049
03:18:33,520 --> 03:18:36,440
I think they rotated when I gave Moxie the heel drone.

4050
03:18:36,460 --> 03:18:37,060
Tick-tack what happened.

4051
03:18:37,220 --> 03:18:38,620
That was the most unfortunate time possible.

4052
03:18:39,220 --> 03:18:40,120
Yeah, because I didn't see it.

4053
03:18:40,140 --> 03:18:42,860
I was like, look, I've been looking at that door for the
rotation.

4054
03:18:45,500 --> 03:18:46,600
Now, it could have been worse timing for you.

4055
03:18:46,620 --> 03:18:46,900
It sucked.

4056
03:18:47,420 --> 03:18:47,740
Yeah.

4057
03:18:49,500 --> 03:18:51,440
I hate timing so much.

4058
03:18:52,220 --> 03:18:52,680
Yeah, I was called.

4059
03:18:52,740 --> 03:18:53,380
Did he timing, honestly?

4060
03:18:53,780 --> 03:18:54,080
That's okay.

4061
03:18:54,180 --> 03:18:54,580
You can chill.

4062
03:18:54,660 --> 03:18:55,200
You can chill.

4063
03:18:55,800 --> 03:18:56,680
You're a little rat boy.

4064
03:18:57,360 --> 03:18:58,240
Yep, right here.

4065
03:18:58,380 --> 03:18:58,960
Just right here.

4066
03:18:59,420 --> 03:19:00,120
Don't need to shoot.

4067
03:19:00,820 --> 03:19:01,540
Don't need to shoot.

4068
03:19:01,700 --> 03:19:02,540
Just be a little rat.

4069
03:19:04,340 --> 03:19:05,460
Little rat, baby.

4070
03:19:07,220 --> 03:19:08,140
Just a little baby.

4071
03:19:10,180 --> 03:19:12,520
I believe in you so much I'm going to go pee.

4072
03:19:14,420 --> 03:19:15,040
It's okay.

4073
03:19:15,520 --> 03:19:16,140
Coms, I think.

4074
03:19:22,680 --> 03:19:23,800
Get by on this one.

03:19:25,940 --> 03:19:26,400
Type shit.

4076
03:19:26,680 --> 03:19:27,440
I'm so fucking dead.

4077
03:19:28,240 --> 03:19:28,620
Next zone.

4078
03:19:29,240 --> 03:19:30,000

Come on.

03:20:28,920 --> 03:20:29,900
Just give me a top five.

4086
03:20:30,180 --> 03:20:31,960
Top five.

4087
03:20:33,600 --> 03:20:34,400
Top five.

4088
03:20:35,560 --> 03:20:36,280
Holy shit.

4089
03:20:36,500 --> 03:20:37,660
My cam is frozen, chat.

4090
03:20:37,820 --> 03:20:38,300
My cam is frozen.

4091
03:20:38,460 --> 03:20:39,300
I'm locked in right now.

4092
03:20:41,600 --> 03:20:42,840
It's just technical difficulty.

4093
03:20:42,980 --> 03:20:43,940
I have to turn a wheel for you every day.

4094
03:20:45,460 --> 03:20:48,240
There's been a lot of technical difficulties when I've
noticed.

4095
03:20:49,000 --> 03:20:49,380
Oh my god.

4096
03:20:49,560 --> 03:20:51,700
If you killed him, you could have been top five.

4097
03:20:52,500 --> 03:20:53,940
How is he alive though?

4098
03:20:54,600 --> 03:20:54,900
He should die.

4099
03:20:55,020 --> 03:20:55,220
He should die.

4100
03:20:55,940 --> 03:20:56,900
He's not dying.

4101
03:20:57,120 --> 03:20:57,940
How did he freeze?

4102
03:20:57,960 --> 03:20:59,100
It's so free!

4103
03:20:59,980 --> 03:21:01,680
I don't understand how he's alive.

4104
03:21:02,260 --> 03:21:03,180
Wait, just keep waiting.

4105
03:21:04,260 --> 03:21:05,420
Maybe this is it.

4106
03:21:06,100 --> 03:21:06,640
He had a teammate.

4107
03:21:06,860 --> 03:21:07,740
There's no way.

4108
03:21:08,660 --> 03:21:11,720
There's no way you have to crawl up.

4109
03:21:14,770 --> 03:21:14,910
Top four.

4110
03:21:15,690 --> 03:21:18,670
Oh, they see you.

4111
03:21:19,190 --> 03:21:19,790
They see you.

4112
03:21:19,930 --> 03:21:20,910
They all see you.

4113
03:21:21,130 --> 03:21:22,130
They all see you.

4114
03:21:22,570 --> 03:21:23,210
Top four!

4115
03:21:23,650 --> 03:21:24,590
Top four!

4116
03:21:25,010 --> 03:21:26,710
A thousand damage, though!

4117
03:21:27,070 --> 03:21:28,030
A thousand damage!

4118
03:21:28,330 --> 03:21:28,930

4121
03:21:50,290 --> 03:21:58,850

alive i think we would have a low replacement i think so too

4123
03:22:06,370 --> 03:22:14,390
yeah because like you as a rat you get to you get to be like
you know by yourself so no one could see you you know yeah

4124
03:22:14,390 --> 03:22:23,070
you don't have two ducks following you around give up your
location so you being the rat actually are these why do you

4125
03:22:23,070 --> 03:22:30,030
so scared of two people there's three of you guys there's
actually have a point maybe next round that we i i i i could

4126
03:22:30,030 --> 03:22:35,370
just sit there and no no because placement points don't
matter next round you have to get all the kills oh i

4127
03:22:35,370 --> 03:22:43,110
actually have to do stuff now yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you

4133
03:23:34,410 --> 03:23:35,770
There's no placement points either.

4134
03:23:35,930 --> 03:23:37,510
So everyone's just going to run at each other.

4135
03:23:37,750 --> 03:23:40,170
Or maybe wait till end game until they start running.

4136
03:23:41,890 --> 03:23:42,430
I don't know.

4137
03:23:44,410 --> 03:23:45,390
We're so good, dude.

Ain't going to move down in the world.

4159
03:25:24,570 --> 03:25:25,210
Yeah, yeah.

4160
03:25:25,290 --> 03:25:26,350

If you guys actually want to play ranked at one point, let
me know.

4165
03:25:40,770 --> 03:25:40,990
I'm down.

4166
03:25:41,390 --> 03:25:42,550
I'm super down.

4167
03:25:44,310 --> 03:25:44,670
Potentially.

4168
03:25:45,730 --> 03:25:45,950
Sheesh.

4169
03:25:46,030 --> 03:25:47,150
I got to look at this game again.

4170
03:25:47,690 --> 03:25:49,530
I have Loki had an itch for Apex.

4171
03:25:50,210 --> 03:25:51,390
He's got to look at the tier list.

4172
03:25:51,390 --> 03:25:53,430
You gotta make him a tier list, Whig.

4173
03:25:53,550 --> 03:25:54,490
I have to know, huh?

4174
03:25:54,810 --> 03:25:55,870
Why don't you make tier lists?

4175
03:25:56,050 --> 03:25:57,390
Do people not like that on the tube?

4176
03:25:58,330 --> 03:25:58,850
Not real.

4177
03:25:58,910 --> 03:25:59,790
I mean, I never tried it.

4178
03:25:59,910 --> 03:26:01,290
Maybe you maybe just conjure something up.

4179
03:26:01,570 --> 03:26:02,150
I'll try it.

4180
03:26:02,330 --> 03:26:04,770
Yeah, you gotta make a tier list for the YouTubes.

4181
03:26:05,690 --> 03:26:06,530
Yeah, I'm gonna try it, actually.

4182
03:26:07,970 --> 03:26:10,450
And then have everyone judge it.

4183
03:26:10,590 --> 03:26:11,630
Be like, are you fucking stupid?

4184
03:26:13,070 --> 03:26:14,790
Why is this gun on S-Rank?

4185
03:26:14,890 --> 03:26:15,630
Are you stupid?

4186
03:26:16,810 --> 03:26:17,170
Like...

4187
03:26:18,110 --> 03:26:19,590
Just get shit on the whole time in the comments.

4188
03:26:19,830 --> 03:26:23,990
Yeah, that'd be like, It's just my most dislikes video.

4189
03:26:24,090 --> 03:26:24,730
I just blame Moxie.

4190
03:26:24,990 --> 03:26:25,590
Yeah, yeah.

4191
03:26:25,690 --> 03:26:28,270
It would be like Moxie, how could you?

4192
03:26:29,970 --> 03:26:31,670
You listen to an unranked player.

4193
03:26:34,430 --> 03:26:36,330
You just tell me the tier list and I'll just make it.

4194
03:26:36,350 --> 03:26:36,890
Oh yeah.

4195
03:26:37,530 --> 03:26:39,250
Yeah, you write the tier list.

4196
03:26:39,890 --> 03:26:42,630
This is like pure rage bait.

4197
03:26:44,050 --> 03:26:44,390
I don't know.

4198
03:26:44,450 --> 03:26:47,150
Legend 301 felt pretty nice when I was using it.

4199
03:26:47,590 --> 03:26:47,730
Thanks.

4200
03:26:48,750 --> 03:26:49,190
That's true.

4201
03:26:49,370 --> 03:26:49,830
What are you thinking?

4202
03:26:51,990 --> 03:26:52,410
Hmm.

4203
03:26:53,410 --> 03:26:54,990
Oh, they banged the damage.

4204
03:26:55,290 --> 03:26:56,530
Bangalore is bad now.

4205
03:26:56,710 --> 03:26:58,070
I mean, we're not playing Bangalore.

4206
03:26:58,350 --> 03:27:00,470
So we shouldn't because it really matter to us.

4207
03:27:00,890 --> 03:27:02,330
No, we can stay on the comp.

4208
03:27:02,430 --> 03:27:04,050
If you guys want, if you're comfortable, I'm cool with it.

4209
03:27:04,470 --> 03:27:05,610
I mean, that comp was fine.

4210
03:27:06,370 --> 03:27:06,850
I think so too.

4211
03:27:07,230 --> 03:27:07,370
Yeah.

4212
03:27:08,530 --> 03:27:10,970
Should I try to grapple out and it went on cooldown.

4213
03:27:11,810 --> 03:27:12,810
I didn't even touch anything.

4214
03:27:13,170 --> 03:27:13,750
I'm sick.

4215
03:27:15,310 --> 03:27:15,570
Yeah.

4216
03:27:15,710 --> 03:27:16,350
All right.

4217
03:27:16,670 --> 03:27:19,650
Are you confident on getting kills on with Pathfinder?

4218
03:27:21,690 --> 03:27:26,570
Sheesh so only his kills can't matter right now placements
don't matter only kill points from moxie.

4219
03:27:26,610 --> 03:27:27,130
Oh shit.

4220
03:27:27,370 --> 03:27:35,790
That's insane Okay, okay, let me think let me think then
What what character do I need to go in and gun people down

4221
03:27:35,790 --> 03:27:36,030
here?

4222
03:27:39,390 --> 03:27:42,230
Hmm, I mean bang wars not bam guys, I'm gonna be honest.

4223
03:27:42,350 --> 03:27:50,110
I don't know if the character really get matters in this
scenario here Sheesh This is a big task

4224
03:27:54,410 --> 03:27:56,450
I mean, Revenant's not a bad call.

4225
03:27:56,590 --> 03:27:57,150
Yeah, you want to play Revenant?

4226
03:28:00,190 --> 03:28:01,770
That's the guy who goes on dying?

4227
03:28:02,990 --> 03:28:03,770
That's the guy.

4228
03:28:04,850 --> 03:28:06,190
Oh, you get armor.

4229
03:28:06,190 --> 03:28:06,890
Revenant's pretty fun.

4230
03:28:06,970 --> 03:28:07,130
Good.

4231
03:28:07,830 --> 03:28:08,350
When you all.

4232
03:28:09,510 --> 03:28:14,250
Yeah, you got like jumps, like crazy leaps, like path
underground, but even better.

4233
03:28:14,550 --> 03:28:15,310
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

4234
03:28:15,410 --> 03:28:16,450
I've played that character then.

4235
03:28:16,730 --> 03:28:17,610
Ballistic, too.

4236
03:28:17,930 --> 03:28:18,570
He's so good.

4237
03:28:19,390 --> 03:28:20,430
I played that character then.

4238
03:28:20,510 --> 03:28:21,370
Maybe I will go to Revenant.

4239
03:28:22,310 --> 03:28:26,530
Yeah, you also got a little bit of extra shield on the ulti,
so be crazy.

4240
03:28:29,430 --> 03:28:31,470
Oh, I forgot to tell you, I do have a loba on me.

4241
03:28:32,510 --> 03:28:33,290
A loba on you?

4242
03:28:33,730 --> 03:28:35,770
Yeah, but loba is not very aggressive, though.

4243
03:28:36,850 --> 03:28:40,670
Hey, throw my teleporter in, boom, sock dead, you know?

4244
03:28:40,730 --> 03:28:42,970
It's a tractor with her gigantic fucking butt.

4245
03:28:44,890 --> 03:28:45,490
What do I do?

4246
03:28:46,550 --> 03:28:48,170
Start waltzing around on that, Matt, bro.

4247
03:28:48,830 --> 03:28:50,150
Maybe you should be on loba, then.

4248
03:28:51,390 --> 03:28:58,450
it'll just be bait for you yeah i'll just email dude i'll

revenant doesn't so revenant doesn't make me invulnerable

4250
03:29:07,170 --> 03:29:16,150
like it doesn't like let me no no it just gives you armor

No pressure.

4267
03:30:35,440 --> 03:30:36,280
No pressure at all.

4268
03:30:36,900 --> 03:30:39,000
You want me to shoot or you want me to just to dance a
little bit?

03:30:39,700 --> 03:30:42,000
Just sit back and dance and watch the show.

4271
03:30:42,540 --> 03:30:42,540
Okay.

4272
03:30:42,960 --> 03:30:45,840
I don't think we're gonna, I don't think we're gonna get his
first place.

4273
03:30:45,920 --> 03:30:47,060
Should I play a ranch character?

4274
03:30:48,880 --> 03:30:50,080
Oh, what have you?

4275
03:30:50,660 --> 03:30:52,260
Should I play crypto to get like banners and stuff?

4276
03:30:52,960 --> 03:30:54,300
Oh, wait, that's smart.

4277
03:30:54,420 --> 03:30:54,920

I'm gonna go crypto.

4280
03:30:56,580 --> 03:30:57,120
I'm gonna go crypto.

4281
03:30:57,360 --> 03:30:58,400
I'm horrible at him, but it's easy.

4282
03:30:58,580 --> 03:30:58,980
I get the bang.

4283
03:30:59,100 --> 03:30:59,560
I'm gonna go back.

4284
03:31:00,580 --> 03:31:00,960
That's fine.

4285
03:31:01,460 --> 03:31:02,920
I'm gonna do that.

4286
03:31:04,640 --> 03:31:06,400
So no G7, have a triple take.

4287
03:31:06,520 --> 03:31:06,720
Repeat.

4288
03:31:07,420 --> 03:31:08,220
Repeater is bad.

4289
03:31:08,980 --> 03:31:10,720
Low key, not that good of guns anyway, so it's fine.

4290
03:31:13,200 --> 03:31:15,580
I mean, I got those kills with a repeater, but don't care.

4291
03:31:16,000 --> 03:31:16,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4292
03:31:17,920 --> 03:31:19,840
One of my kills was with a repeater.

4293
03:31:20,000 --> 03:31:21,200
Or two of my kills were with a repeater.

4294
03:31:24,220 --> 03:31:25,260

4608
03:46:45,560 --> 03:46:52,980
getting into when we signed up we were like, yeah, that's
gonna be uh, yeah, we were I did, okay, look, with the team

4609
03:46:52,980 --> 03:46:54,860
name and everything, we knew what we were getting into.

4610
03:46:55,400 --> 03:46:55,480
Uh,

4611
03:46:59,660 --> 03:47:02,000
but like, uh, it was fun, though.

4612
03:47:02,040 --> 03:47:03,280
That was just so unlucky.

4613
03:47:03,440 --> 03:47:07,340
It was just, um, it was just really unlucky.

4614
03:47:07,500 --> 03:47:09,780
I mean, it really doesn't matter who wins that rep map.

4615
03:47:09,980 --> 03:47:12,180
It's all about, it was all about uh, kills.

4616
03:47:12,400 --> 03:47:13,880
So it's like whichever team had the most kills.

4617
03:47:14,420 --> 03:47:23,240
Um, Yeah, it was just, it was just like, it was just unlucky
with the, with the lag and everything.

4618
03:47:23,460 --> 03:47:26,380
And then the moment we stopped lagging, Zone was on us.

4619
03:47:27,600 --> 03:47:32,220
It's just a very unlucky, unlucky RNG there.

4620
03:47:32,920 --> 03:47:34,840
Yeah, it was like, what can you do?

4621
03:47:34,960 --> 03:47:39,480
Yeah, definitely what can you, I think, I don't know, I
don't even think if they like delayed the tournament.

4622
03:47:40,440 --> 03:47:43,820
If they delayed the tournament, it's not really going to
change anything.

4623
03:47:45,640 --> 03:47:46,440
universal problem.

4624
03:47:47,120 --> 03:47:47,120
Yeah.

4625
03:47:47,380 --> 03:47:51,640
We got the vibes, but at what cost?

4626
03:47:56,920 --> 03:48:00,840
Um, um, but I had a fun time.

4627
03:48:01,020 --> 03:48:03,140
I really enjoyed playing with both Moxie and Wig.

4628
03:48:03,240 --> 03:48:05,220
I knew like having them on my team.

4629
03:48:05,800 --> 03:48:11,400
Um, I knew having both of them on my team, it was, uh, it
was gonna be really fun because I knew like, you know, Wig's

4630
03:48:11,400 --> 03:48:14,300
a really fun guy to play with and Moxie was a really fun guy
to play with too.

4631
03:48:14,500 --> 03:48:20,900
So I knew like having all three of them together like it
would be like a good back and forth with everyone um so you

4632
03:48:20,900 --> 03:48:28,060
know not last our goal was to not get last and we did it
yeah rivals after party i don't really want solo cute rivals

4633
03:48:28,060 --> 03:48:40,640
i mean i could ask yo moxy you wanna rivals after party my
stream rivals

4634
03:48:46,580 --> 03:48:58,220
don't want to solo queue right now uh i ping moxie if he
wants to rival his after party um but yeah it was fun i mean

4635
03:48:58,220 --> 03:49:07,540
i had a like the one time the one time that we had a real
fight wow we won

4636
03:49:10,980 --> 03:49:26,220
isn't that crazy like we actually had a real fight and then
we won the game that's insane who would have sunk it yeah

4637
03:49:26,220 --> 03:49:36,500
and then like all the other time yeah funny how that works
and they the crazy part was that they we were one man down

4638
03:49:36,500 --> 03:49:40,580
like Moxie was fully down, and we still won the fight.

4639
03:49:40,680 --> 03:49:41,780
It was literally a 2v3.

4640
03:49:42,900 --> 03:49:45,820
And he also did 13 damage in that entire fight, too.

4641
03:49:46,160 --> 03:49:46,840
That's crazy.

4642
03:49:48,320 --> 03:49:52,560
He did 13 damage in that entire fight.

4643
03:49:53,100 --> 03:49:55,400
But he was good bait.

4644
03:49:55,540 --> 03:49:56,820
He baited everyone.

4645
03:50:00,200 --> 03:50:02,080
Oh, Moxie can't do it.

4646
03:50:02,140 --> 03:50:07,520
He said he has to do a top 500 solo Q on tank.

4647
03:50:08,420 --> 03:50:16,480
um so he can't he can't do it right now um so i'll just call
it here then i'll just call it here i was just like oh i

4648
03:50:16,480 --> 03:50:24,460
don't really want to solo here right now you're right 13
damage is is 13 damage i told you did he did um he did we

4649
03:50:24,460 --> 03:50:32,380
was good bait he got them all rushing us and we still won
the the fucking 2v3 um yeah now yeah we need we need a

4650
03:50:32,380 --> 03:50:33,800
weapon tier list for him yeah

4651
03:50:37,700 --> 03:50:42,500
Like, I'm like sitting and like, what can I, like, you know,
I can't really go to a dentist today because it's fully

4652
03:50:42,500 --> 03:50:42,900
booked.

4653
03:50:43,580 --> 03:50:46,900
It's tomorrow, so I hope they can fix the problem tomorrow.

4654
03:50:49,500 --> 03:50:54,000
But I had a fun time vibing with Wig and Moxie.

4655
03:50:55,360 --> 03:51:00,620
I mean, I haven't played in a long ass time, so I knew I
knew what I was getting into.

4656
03:51:03,660 --> 03:51:04,680
It's just unfortunate.

4657
03:51:04,920 --> 03:51:07,520
I wish I wish the servers weren't lagging so we could have.

4658
03:51:07,540 --> 03:51:14,760
had like real fights I think I think if it wasn't lagging
and we actually had like a real fight it definitely I mean

4659
03:51:14,760 --> 03:51:21,820
obviously for anyone it would always be more fun you know I
feel like I think we all know if we had a real fight it

4660
03:51:21,820 --> 03:51:31,720
would obviously be a lot more fun to play so it's just that
um I think like if I ever get future apex invite tournament

4661
03:51:31,720 --> 03:51:41,300
invites um If I get another Apex tournament invites, I will,
I will look into whether or not the servers are fixed

4662
03:51:41,300 --> 03:51:42,480
because I really don't want to do that again.

4663
03:51:42,760 --> 03:51:51,500
I really, I know like, even if I get like a fun team to play
with, I don't think it's not fun playing like, like I, like

4664
03:51:51,500 --> 03:51:53,620
I was so laggy.

4665
03:51:53,700 --> 03:52:00,360
I tried not to get super tilted when, when I was literally
that one game where we had to, where I was like literally

4666
03:52:00,360 --> 03:52:02,540
like pausing every time.

4667
03:52:03,520 --> 03:52:09,020
um when i was literally pausing every time it was just like
it was just way too much i was trying not to get fucking

4668
03:52:09,020 --> 03:52:16,000
tilted there but i was so i like i was really tilted at that
because like because it was just it was just way too much

4669
03:52:16,000 --> 03:52:22,780
like i couldn't even like do any movement stuff yeah um so
if i do get another future apex tournament invite i'm

4670
03:52:22,780 --> 03:52:31,500
actually just gonna i'm just gonna check if it's like if
like um yeah we were like literally floating

4671
03:52:35,100 --> 03:52:42,220
and it sucked i think the worst part was just the fact that
of all the games they choose to restart it was that game too

4672
03:52:42,220 --> 03:52:48,240
that like made me really tilted because it's like you didn't
restart like i know that's like really hard to pick but it's

4673
03:52:48,240 --> 03:52:54,040
like picking and choosing when to restart you either restart
all the games or like you go on with it because you know

4674
03:52:54,040 --> 03:52:59,800
like there's nothing else you can do yeah i was just like
i'd have to restart after either keep it consistent on

4675
03:52:59,800 --> 03:53:13,220
restarting games or just don't restart and it was such a
late restart too yeah yeah it was way too late too yeah we

4676
03:53:13,220 --> 03:53:18,860
had a really good spot so that like tilted me that's why i'm
like saying i don't want to be like that tilted again so

4677
03:53:18,860 --> 03:53:31,040
even though i came in there for fun um um either uh they
they uh came either like i just wanted to like i just want

4678
03:53:31,040 --> 03:53:34,400
to know if the lobbies are still like that the lobbies are
still gonna be like that i won't join another tournament

4679
03:53:34,400 --> 03:53:41,400
like that just because it was like also like i saw the
channel where people were complaining and it was just like

4680
03:53:41,400 --> 03:53:47,460
there was just like everyone's just like being like lag lag
lag like the literally top five like the first place team

4681
03:53:47,460 --> 03:53:53,280
was complaining about the lag like because they're like we
died to lag and i was like duh and you know for a first

4682
03:53:53,280 --> 03:54:00,920
place team that really fucking sucks too because you know
they could easily lose first place because of the lag too so

4683
03:54:00,920 --> 03:54:12,780
i saw like it was like you know that's not fun in general um
but yeah anyway um love playing with moxie and wigg um i

4684
03:54:12,780 --> 03:54:18,920

other for the first time today and it didn't really seem

4685
03:54:18,920 --> 03:54:27,280
