1
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,900
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,900
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:56,100
Before we begin, a huge shoutout to RuneFactory for the sponsor.

4
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:01,640
And for sponsoring me so I can check out their newest game, RuneFactory Guardians of Azuma!

5
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,640
This is actually my very first time playing a RuneFactory game.

6
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,240
I've never played a RuneFactory game before, but I've heard a lot about it.

7
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:17,480
As someone that has played a lot of their other farming games before, I have heard about RuneFactory.

8
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,600
This game I haven't tried yet.

9
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:24,580
So this will be my first time, first experience diving in on the whole series.

10
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:41,120
What I have heard, though, is that if you've never tried RuneFactory before, apparently their newest game, Guardians of Azuma, is very newbie-friendly compared to other RuneFactory games.

11
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,860
It's very streamlined, very beginner-friendly, especially if you've never played it before.

12
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,680
Which is me.

13
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,320
So I'm fully blind playthrough.

14
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,880
I just know that it's like farming and with RPG elements into it.

15
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,420
And this is the first time that they actually focused on a whole Japanese and Asian aesthetic for the franchise.

16
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:07,560
Well, yeah, apparently it's a very good jumping point into the series if you've never played it before.

17
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,880
And I'll be like, you know, I'll be like the first time experience for it, like the proof of that.

18
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,520
Because I've never played RuneFactory before.

19
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:19,780
So then going in not completely blind, I do know like, you know, of course, because I am sponsored.

20
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:26,360
I do know the background information about it, like the basics of it.

21
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:34,620
So just like a lot of like farming games, there are a lot of romantic interests, a lot of wise foos, a lot of husbandos.

22
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:45,760
So, um, apparently you can pick, I think, 16 different romance candidates in Azuma, which is the best part.

23
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,960
A lot of variety, a lot of choices.

24
00:03:52,220 --> 00:04:04,120
So, we're gonna be here to pick our waifu slash husbando and whichever one we're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna charm and romance so they'll live on the farm with us.

25
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,300
I'm not gonna be too greedy this time.

26
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,300
Uh, but like I said, huge shout out to RuneFactory for sponsoring me.

27
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:19,260
If you want to support the stream, if you want to support, um, if you want to support the game, please feel free to click on the link pinned in the chat or like in the description below.

28
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,580
It does help out a lot.

29
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:32,460
So yes, um, but like I said, um, um, this game is, uh, for the first time is heavily focused on like, uh, the, uh, Japanese aesthetic as well as design.

30
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:37,220
And, uh, there's like other, there's, you get to play as something called an Earth Dancer.

31
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,960
And there's a lot of new weapons and stuff.

32
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,120
So there's apparently the newest weapons are like bows and talisman.

33
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:46,440
But the RuneFactory, like veterans out there, you guys are like, oh my God, new weapons!

34
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,540
And a bow is like a gun.

35
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,980
So, so I might, I might try out the bow because a bow is like the medieval gun.

36
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,480
So like pew pew.

37
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,840
Um, and so you can also like rebuild entire villages and stuff.

38
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:09,280
So, you know, like you can, uh, crap, you know, you can like make your own town and rebuild things and start like building, putting buildings on.

39
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,120
Like, I don't like you, move out.

40
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,680
I feel like, you know, I want, you know what?

41
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,280
I want more restaurants in my village.

42
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:22,840
I want my entire village to just be bow shops and stuff like that.

43
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,380
So there's like a lot of customization that comes to it.

44
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:32,560
And, uh, the more buildings you place, the more your town, you know, becomes more lively and, uh, becomes like bigger and better.

45
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:32,800
Yeah.

46
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,860
We need more food.

47
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,140
I'm going to gentrify my village.

48
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,260
And, um, there's like a heavy focus on the farming aspect as well.

49
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,720
Like, as you know, it's like a combination of farming and RPG.

50
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,800
Uh, so I'm like super excited.

51
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:55,020
Uh, they apparently in the DLC, they added two new characters to romance.

52
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,520
And I believe, um, I hope I don't butcher their names.

53
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,420
But I believe their names are Tuelan and Pelika.

54
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:12,020
So there are like, if you buy the DLC, the Seasons of Love bundle DLC, you can charm, you can romance even more villagers.

55
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,060
Yay!

56
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,900
More variety!

57
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,420
That's my favorite part.

58
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,380
You can, that's, there's so much replayability, see?

59
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,260
There's so much replayability.

60
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,020
Every run, you romance a new villager.

61
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:24,700
Haha!

62
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,640
Create your own harem, you know?

63
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,800
Safe, this is like, safe file number one will be her.

64
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,400
Safe file number two will be him.

65
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:38,880
And then you can like, bounce between safe files with all your, all your husbandos and waifus.

66
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,400
Hahaha!

67
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:48,260
Anyway, as you didn't know, uh, Rune Factory, Guardians of Azuma, it has also like, Haha!

68
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,760
I don't think I can read that.

69
00:06:50,140 --> 00:07:00,740
Has, has physical additions that are available now for, um, on the Switch for $59.99, or on the Switch 2 for $69.99.

70
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,720
So, if you want to buy it now, you can actually with a physical copy in.

71
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:11,980
Um, and it arrives on the, there's also like, the Earth Dancer edition, which arrives on June 20th.

72
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:19,380
And you will get like, a limited edition with like, a lot of, uh, I'm extra giggly because I'm hyped up on caffeine for the last couple of hours.

73
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,460
Um, hahaha!

74
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:28,220
So, um, the limited edition comes with a Woobly plush keychain, which is like, I believe their mascot.

75
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,720
Um, it's like their, the animal guide mascot.

76
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,080
And it comes with two to CD soundtrack.

77
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,820
A hundred and sixty page art book.

78
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,060
Oh my god, I love art books.

79
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,300
Uh, Sacred Fan with display stand.

80
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,580
And the additional DLC content.

81
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,760
Season of Love, which means you get more romantic choices.

82
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,540
Uh, Festive Attire.

83
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,880
And Dark Woobly.

84
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:53,200
And I, I believe, I don't know, I don't know who, what, who exactly is Dark Woobly.

85
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:58,180
But maybe because his name is Dark Woobly, I assume he's like, Woobly but evil.

86
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,760
Um, that's just my assumption.

87
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,460
Hahaha!

88
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,180
As well as like, Rune Factory 4 outfits and a useful item bundle.

89
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,640
Um, also apparently the Switch 2, oh he's not?

90
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,680
Wait, is he edgy Woobly then?

91
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,080
Is he emo Woobly?

92
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,380
Uh, the Switch 2 version does work on the original Nintendo Switch.

93
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,820
So, um, so, and it does come with an upgrade pack.

94
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,680
So your saves will, can transfer from the Switch to the Switch 2.

95
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,820
So you don't have to worry about that.

96
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:26,500
Anyway!

97
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,780
Let's get right into it!

98
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,340
Rune Factory time!

99
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,420
Okay, wait.

100
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,680
Rune, for real!

101
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,080
Rune!

102
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:34,420
Haha!

103
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,080
Now!

104
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,180
Rune Factory time!

105
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,960
Um, it's just them with their hair dyed black and shouts out!

106
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:42,880
Hahaha!

107
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,780
Doth Woobly!

108
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,060
You know you want Dark Woobly!

109
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:48,540
It's...

110
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,060
For show me what you look like.

111
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:51,480
Ooh!

112
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,740
I can be...

113
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:52,900
Okay.

114
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,200
Ah!

115
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,860
Okay, the girl is really cute.

116
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,600
Okay, I'm gonna...

117
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,220
I'm gonna say like, the two choices.

118
00:08:59,460 --> 00:08:59,920
Also sound good.

119
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,180
Let me know if I should turn up the sound or not.

120
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,840
I'm gonna say...

121
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,940
The girl character...

122
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,020
Is a lot...

123
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:07,440
I'm sorry.

124
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,880
But the girl character...

125
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,180
Is a lot cuter.

126
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:10,860
Hahaha!

127
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,520
I'm sorry!

128
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,480
She just...

129
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,140
There's just something...

130
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,660
Yeah, her style is...

131
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,100
She just has...

132
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,140
More fashion.

133
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:19,840
Hahaha!

134
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:21,720
Hahaha!

135
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,140
Hahaha!

136
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,300
She's just a little more fashionable.

137
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,340
And I like...

138
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,260
I like looking at her.

139
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,580
Um, but...

140
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,520
I like to...

141
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:29,700
No!

142
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:30,720
Haha!

143
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,000
Sorry!

144
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:31,720
Hahaha!

145
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,860
It's not you!

146
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,980
It's not you!

147
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:35,640
It's not you!

148
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,780
Maybe it is a little bit you.

149
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:37,880
But...

150
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:39,780
Alright.

151
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:42,540
Not...

152
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,320
Doki.

153
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:47,420
Um...

154
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,340
Alright.

155
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,600
A file name.

156
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,220
Now, when were you born?

157
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,040
Uh...

158
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,380
Wait, what month is it?

159
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:54,840
Summer?

160
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:55,440
Autumn?

161
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:55,720
Oh!

162
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:56,860
Summer.

163
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,300
Guys, my birthday is soon, guys.

164
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,760
It is in a month.

165
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,760
I see.

166
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,780
How much of a challenge do you desire?

167
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,840
Focus on the plot while...

168
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,100
Hahaha!

169
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:08,980
Okay.

170
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,200
Let's do a balanced...

171
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,620
The intended experience, guys.

172
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:14,860
Alright.

173
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,700
Not Doki.

174
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,300
I was gonna say story mode.

175
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:17,780
Hahaha!

176
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,080
Yeah, my birthday is a month, guys!

177
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:30,550
I don't know.

178
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:30,690
I don't know.

179
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,070
She just has more, like, pizzazz about her.

180
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:33,570
And so...

181
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:34,410
Oh my god.

182
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:34,870
There's a...

183
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,610
That's a dragon.

184
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,820
That's two dragons.

185
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,460
Is that Dark Woobly?

186
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,540
Oh it is!

187
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:50,980
Wait!

188
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,320
I think that's Dark Woobly!

189
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,060
Cause that's...

190
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:56,460
That's...

191
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,600
That's normal Woobly!

192
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,260
I knew it!

193
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,240
I knew Dark Woobly was just...

194
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:03,800
What is it?

195
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,320
Was Woobly but evil.

196
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,250
Oh my god.

197
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:20,090
Fight!

198
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:20,530
Fight!

199
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:21,030
Fight!

200
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:21,510
Fight!

201
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:21,890
Fight!

202
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:25,050
My...

203
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:25,250
Haha!

204
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,530
This is my Woobly OC.

205
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,610
Dark Woobly.

206
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,850
I bring game up a little bit?

207
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:33,110
Yeah.

208
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,610
No problem.

209
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:36,830
Whoops.

210
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:37,390
Haha!

211
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:38,390
Give me a sec.

212
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,530
I'm just bringing up the game.

213
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:39,850
Haha!

214
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,250
Tactical pause!

215
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:42,970
Okay, there you go.

216
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,850
Tactical pause time!

217
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:45,430
Wait!

218
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:45,690
Don't!

219
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:46,170
Don't skip!

220
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:46,610
Don't!

221
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,010
Oh, it is yin yang colors!

222
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:49,190
Wait!

223
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:49,590
You're right!

224
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,650
I like how they use the other main character as...

225
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:55,630
Uh...

226
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,450
As like...

227
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:56,890
The villain.

228
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,650
Confront the black dragon.

229
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,130
Brace the dazzling light.

230
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,170
Oh, that's me!

231
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:06,830
Ah!

232
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,450
Oh, it's not Doki versus Doki.

233
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,130
Haha!

234
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,850
The other one is Doki.

235
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,750
And I'm not Doki.

236
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,030
Just a dream.

237
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:17,710
Oh wait!

238
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:18,790
I don't have to...

239
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,570
I don't have to read!

240
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:20,550
Thank god!

241
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,290
Good morning!

242
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:23,450
Oh my god!

243
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,250
10 out of 10.

244
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,770
I don't have to read.

245
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,390
Also, I brought up the volume a little bit.

246
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:36,090
If you feel lost, use the escape to open camp menu and check the tutorials in your adventure log.

247
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:36,430
Okay!

248
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:39,730
Do you have any idea what time it is?

249
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,130
Okay, so there's the action...

250
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:41,570
The...

251
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,170
The fight mode of this.

252
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:43,450
Oh!

253
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:44,650
This is my home?

254
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,750
Alright, let's look at...

255
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,750
Alright, so...

256
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,650
I need to fix...

257
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,270
Mouse sensitivity.

258
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:52,890
I almost forgot about mouse sensitivity.

259
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,590
And here's the volume, sound guy.

260
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:56,870
Here's the volume.

261
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,610
You want to fix the sound...

262
00:12:58,610 --> 00:12:59,410
Easier.

263
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,150
Alright, let me up the volume a little bit here.

264
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:02,830
Alright, here we go.

265
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:04,670
Alright.

266
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,050
Oh, I don't need to look at the license.

267
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,810
I definitely read that earlier.

268
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:09,730
Oh.

269
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:11,850
Okay, so that's where I woke up.

270
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:12,770
Wait, what happened here?

271
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,290
It's awfully...

272
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:15,570
No, I have to read!

273
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,350
Most likely because of the enormous hole in the roof.

274
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:19,610
Wait, who did that?

275
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,930
Wait a minute.

276
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,130
That's not...

277
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,410
That's not cool.

278
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:24,590
Oh my god, Meido!

279
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:26,690
Can I romance her?

280
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,190
Can I flirt with her?

281
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:29,910
Hiroa!

282
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,710
Is she my new waifu?

283
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,830
Is she waifu number one?

284
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:35,570
I'm sorry.

285
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,350
Now, hurry and wash up.

286
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,850
We'll have breakfast after we tidy the shrine.

287
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,190
More cleaning today?

288
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,490
I didn't realize you were such a neat freak.

289
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,050
Cleanliness is a daily routine.

290
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:49,850
Is she my maid?

291
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,650
Besides, those who don't work, don't eat.

292
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,190
I suppose.

293
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,710
Can I ask you to take care of the sweeping bin?

294
00:13:58,930 --> 00:13:59,670
I paid you.

295
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,210
Wait, why am I sweeping?

296
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:02,250
Okay.

297
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:04,910
Wait a minute.

298
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,690
Oh, she's a lazy maid.

299
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,190
Fine.

300
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,330
Just cause you're cute.

301
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,730
I'll sweep for us.

302
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:15,970
I'm the maid's maid.

303
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:17,850
Never mind.

304
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,850
She's not gonna be my first waifu.

305
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,750
She made the first mistake.

306
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,210
Making me clean.

307
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,640
Has it really been that long?

308
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:29,940
Oh, wait.

309
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,060
Am I a freeloader?

310
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,140
Oh, I'm the problem.

311
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,080
Never mind.

312
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,380
Boy, did we start off with a bang.

313
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:37,940
Never mind, guys.

314
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,440
Apparently, I'm the...

315
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,680
Who would have thought I was the problem?

316
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,920
I'm just a freeloader.

317
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,560
Under a big hole in the roof.

318
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,040
Oh, I caused that and we never fixed it for half a year?

319
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,860
You must be someone really special.

320
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,440
I mean, I fucking lived.

321
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:00,860
Sorry.

322
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:01,700
I'm fr...

323
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,020
Sorry.

324
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,020
I'm sorry.

325
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,440
I freaking lived through that crash.

326
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,100
I better be special.

327
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,000
I...

328
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,160
I came down from the sky.

329
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,680
I'm a messenger from the dragon god or something.

330
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,140
Oh, please.

331
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,420
I doubt that.

332
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,180
Turkey, please.

333
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,660
Divine envoy, you're now.

334
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,060
I'm happy to have you.

335
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:27,100
Since so many villagers have moved out, it feels good welcoming a new neighbor for a change.

336
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,200
Wait, how many villagers moved out?

337
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,300
Am I the only person living here?

338
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,380
What did you do?

339
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:32,800
Thank you.

340
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:33,940
I'm glad to hear.

341
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:36,960
Yeah.

342
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,800
I'm the only person that lives here.

343
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,720
What did you do?

344
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,020
There's a...

345
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,220
It's a problem if I'm the only one here.

346
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,080
Where are...

347
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,920
Where are...

348
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,960
What did you do to them?

349
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:55,700
Where are they?

350
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,980
So, who is the god of the shrine anyway?

351
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:00,780
Uh...

352
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,580
Good question.

353
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:01,880
Yeah.

354
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,260
All I know is that they're a dragon.

355
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:04,760
What?

356
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,280
What was their name again?

357
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,420
Aren't you a shrine maiden?

358
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,880
I think it's...

359
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,620
Mocha or something?

360
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:11,720
Okay.

361
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,500
I need to speak to your boss.

362
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,580
You don't know who you're worshipping?

363
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,600
Okay.

364
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,160
Guys, can we fix her?

365
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,580
Do you think...

366
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,480
Do you think we could fix her?

367
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,420
She is the boss.

368
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:28,720
Okay.

369
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,780
That doesn't...

370
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,320
Reassure me, chat.

371
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,000
Okay.

372
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,660
I got a plum branch.

373
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,200
Oh!

374
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,580
Oh, I can encrypt sacred treasure.

375
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:38,780
Okay.

376
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,400
The sacred treasure is like related to like the farm stuff around here too.

377
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,500
Why fix...

378
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,720
She doesn't even do her job!

379
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,100
What do you mean?

380
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:48,680
Could you please...

381
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,160
Could you please dance and recite the prayer?

382
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,900
My favorite type of shrine mate.

383
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,260
She doesn't know what she's even worshipping!

384
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,480
Prosper.

385
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,060
Yay!

386
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,540
Oh, that's how you save.

387
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,920
She's perfect.

388
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:03,880
Oh!

389
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:04,640
You like that?

390
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,340
Offer these humble words.

391
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,720
A dance for her, Doki.

392
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,920
Great god of the dragon shrine.

393
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,640
Mocha something.

394
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,060
May your divine glory shine forth.

395
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,180
And bless us all forever more.

396
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:19,600
Alright.

397
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,000
Oh, she likes my...

398
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,900
You want me to dance more for you, you know?

399
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,880
Perform the dance of bonds that save statues.

400
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,880
Establish a link with the divine dragon within.

401
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:30,940
Saving all...

402
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,380
Okay, so that's how you save your game.

403
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:32,920
Oh, okay.

404
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,440
Also, let me...

405
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,200
Let me increase the volume up just a little bit more.

406
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,520
Uh, alright.

407
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,320
I increased the volume a little bit.

408
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,380
Let me know that's better.

409
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:44,500
Alright.

410
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,580
Hello, I did my job.

411
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,480
Did you like it?

412
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,040
Perfect!

413
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,300
You always look so graceful when you dance.

414
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:51,940
Dance for me!

415
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,400
Yes!

416
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:52,900
Yes!

417
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,240
Why a plum branch?

418
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:56,720
I wonder.

419
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,160
Wait, I just do her entire job.

420
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,100
I just noticed that.

421
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,520
The dragon god really likes plum blossoms for one.

422
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,220
I think it's also supposed to help you forge an eternal bond with them.

423
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:08,740
Okay.

424
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,780
Can it really do that?

425
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:11,860
Sis!

426
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:13,800
Oh!

427
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,080
Aw!

428
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,800
Aw, she's cute!

429
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,940
Okay, so the town of two...

430
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,140
The town of three people.

431
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,500
Aw, you sweetie.

432
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,520
Thanks!

433
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,600
And here you go!

434
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,260
Enjoy!

435
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:27,580
Yay!

436
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,520
Free food!

437
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,700
I do her job and all I get paid on is food.

438
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:32,460
Thank you so much.

439
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,600
Food and...

440
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,080
I guess food and housing.

441
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,340
Is she hungry too?

442
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,540
What?

443
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,620
Yeah, I'll just eat when she's not watching.

444
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,440
This is my paycheck, guys!

445
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,580
Guys!

446
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,120
This is my paycheck!

447
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,160
Have you eaten already at all?

448
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,120
Yep!

449
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,360
She can ask her sister for food.

450
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,320
She's a child!

451
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,200
Why...

452
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,020
Why is she asking me?!

453
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,120
Her sister is right there!

454
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,460
All I paid in is food!

455
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,540
And survival of the fittest!

456
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,260
Hello!

457
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:22,900
Good morning!

458
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,580
Oh, it's a village of four!

459
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,140
Okay!

460
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,460
That's a lot better!

461
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,240
Suzu!

462
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,620
I see you're a bright little ball of energy as always!

463
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,500
There's a good girl!

464
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,240
I'm the best girl!

465
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,300
She does not look like she's starving!

466
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,000
You can't gas like me!

467
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,380
Simple!

468
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,720
Thank you for the super chat!

469
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,120
Thank you!

470
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:46,700
Thank you!

471
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,340
Now then!

472
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,320
Would you two come with me?

473
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,340
The IA will be leaving shortly!

474
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,480
And I thought you might like to see her off!

475
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:53,920
Okay!

476
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,580
Who's...

477
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,300
Who's...

478
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:57,780
Alright!

479
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,840
I wanna know who she is!

480
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,820
She's so hungry!

481
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:03,420
Doki!

482
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,880
She just sees me as an easy mark!

483
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,540
Why is she asking me instead of a sister who's right there?

484
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,060
In fact!

485
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,400
Her sister is a bad person!

486
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,980
For not feeding her younger sister!

487
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,180
How am I the evil person when her sister's the evil one?

488
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:28,840
Yes!

489
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,780
Everyone's been so helpful!

490
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:32,940
Good!

491
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:33,900
Good!

492
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:40,660
Nearly 50 years have passed since the Celestial Collapse!

493
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,580
The Celestial Collapse?

494
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,060
What's that?

495
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:46,520
Our village once bustled with travelers from all over Azuma!

496
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,600
Now...

497
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,760
It's but a shadow of its former self!

498
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,660
Have you tried, like, tourism?

499
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,800
Ever since that disaster!

500
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,200
Plants and animals alike have lost their vigor!

501
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,280
Wait, what?

502
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,560
The land itself is starved!

503
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,580
Yeah, that tree does not look so hot!

504
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,620
Like, it's the summer!

505
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,600
And nothing is growing there!

506
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,080
Runes?

507
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:10,460
Runes?

508
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,640
The source of all life!

509
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,950
Oh my gosh!

510
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:21,410
What happened to the runes?

511
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,790
Looks like it won't bloom this year either!

512
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,130
How tragic!

513
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,670
You mean...

514
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:31,690
A rune?

515
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,210
You mean...

516
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:33,370
A factory of them?

517
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,850
Before the collapse...

518
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:39,090
It gave us gorgeous flowers every year!

519
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:42,590
It sounds like they could use a...

520
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,030
Rune factory!

521
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,350
That captivating sight earned us another moniker!

522
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:51,530
A village of ever-blooming flowers!

523
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:56,150
So I guess when this tree started dying, people started moving away because they're like, Wait...

524
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:58,330
This town doesn't even have flowers!

525
00:21:59,110 --> 00:21:59,670
Do you really plan to cut it down?

526
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:01,430
Indeed!

527
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:06,270
Takumi's inspection revealed that the roots have already begun to rot!

528
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,470
Best to remove it before it falls!

529
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:10,230
No!

530
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,270
We can save it!

531
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,010
I can fix that tree!

532
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,550
I'll dance in front of it!

533
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:17,310
Don't worry!

534
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:18,770
I'll dance!

535
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,950
I'm afraid so!

536
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:24,590
Legend says that a very beautiful...

537
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,090
False advertisement!

538
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:29,090
No!

539
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,490
Not that any of us have laid eyes on her!

540
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,450
After all...

541
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:36,850
I was barely older than Suzu when this tree last bloomed!

542
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:40,490
Wait, that's how long it's been?!

543
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:42,650
Sakaki!

544
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,490
Why didn't you do anything?!

545
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:46,490
You're...

546
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,030
Oh crap!

547
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,070
You're so old now!

548
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:49,550
What?!

549
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,310
Hey, hey!

550
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,150
What's a...

551
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:55,490
Good question!

552
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:58,550
Hmm...

553
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,750
He did it!

554
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,910
It's what he's supposed to do!

555
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:03,770
It's been like...

556
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,270
50 plus years!

557
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:06,830
Not even 50!

558
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,110
70 plus years!

559
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:11,470
And now he decided to do something about it!

560
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,890
I don't even know what a...

561
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,210
What do you mean why I'm mean to her?

562
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,310
I don't even know!

563
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,430
You think I have Google back then?

564
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,840
I don't even know!

565
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,160
And so our population drops again...

566
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,380
Oh, she's moving away too!

567
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:30,940
No!

568
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,800
From what I hear...

569
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,220
The rest of Azuma fares little better than our village.

570
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,280
I wish her well out there.

571
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,420
Is it cause he can't dance?

572
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:52,860
If you're listening, I hope you recover soon.

573
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,080
And when you do...

574
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,880
Please bless us with your beautiful flowers again!

575
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,340
Please!

576
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,180
Oh...

577
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,040
That does it!

578
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,680
I'll be the one to revitalize our village!

579
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,420
What are you gonna do, Iroha?

580
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,560
I'll convince plenty of customers to visit my tea shop...

581
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,700
And try the best Dango and Azuma!

582
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,260
Okay...

583
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:16,300
Those who will blame me for not feeding the child...

584
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,620
She literally owns a tea house with Dango.

585
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,980
How is that my fault?

586
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,340
Let me help!

587
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,160
Let me help!

588
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,360
Let me help!

589
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,040
Yeah!

590
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:29,920
Alright...

591
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,020
We got this!

592
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,980
With the power of tea houses...

593
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,560
I shall make this entire village just tea houses...

594
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,020
Oh, nice!

595
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,180
God!

596
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,820
Who put weed in the box?

597
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,780
I tired of only Dango...

598
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,220
What's wrong, Suzu?

599
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,800
Yeah, let's go...

600
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,300
Are you okay?

601
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,820
Can I ask a favor?

602
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:48,920
Go ahead.

603
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:49,420
Yeah.

604
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,840
So lately...

605
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,840
Whenever I play outside the village...

606
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,420
I keep seeing this really weird animal...

607
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,860
What is it?

608
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,120
Is it the Wubbly?

609
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,360
Weird...

610
00:24:59,360 --> 00:24:59,760
How?

611
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,520
Oh my god!

612
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,400
It's Wubbly!

613
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,700
And just...

614
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:05,980
Oh my god!

615
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:08,140
We're gonna meet a real hero today, guys!

616
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,320
Will you help me look for it?

617
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,070
Pretty...

618
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:13,230
Alright...

619
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,210
Maybe not...

620
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:14,950
Okay...

621
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:15,430
Okay...

622
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,070
I really wanna meet Wubbly...

623
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,070
If it was...

624
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,270
You're so lucky...

625
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:21,050
You're so lucky that's Wubbly...

626
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,030
Or I would have said no...

627
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:23,790
You're the best!

628
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:24,610
Yay!

629
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:26,310
Let me show you...

630
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,430
I'm not doing it for you...

631
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,970
I'm doing it for Wubbly...

632
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:30,750
Huh?

633
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:31,870
Suzu?

634
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:34,530
Alright...

635
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:35,650
Oh, I can run!

636
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:36,370
Okay, nice!

637
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:37,610
Alright, where's Wubbly?

638
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:38,730
Where is he?

639
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:40,450
I saw it around here yesterday...

640
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:41,990
Bright white...

641
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:43,230
And covered in fluff!

642
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,390
White fluff?

643
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:47,670
A wooly maybe?

644
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:49,730
Come this way!

645
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,040
Alright...

646
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,980
An orange destination marker...

647
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,980
Shows your current goal.

648
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,040
These markers appear on the mini-map...

649
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,860
In the top right corner of the screen.

650
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,080
Open the map from the camp menu...

651
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,880
For a wider overview of the area.

652
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,540
Alright, you can also open the map at any time...

653
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,080
With M.

654
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:09,620
Okay...

655
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,800
Oh, okay...

656
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,800
Oh, so this is the village!

657
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,660
And then you can see like...

658
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,520
I can purify...

659
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,500
I believe like the more I purify...

660
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,780
The more people will wanna move into my village.

661
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,780
I heard I can like...

662
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:29,800
Wait...

663
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,440
View a character's profile to check their likes...

664
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,480
Plus the bottom bonuses you can unlock by...

665
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,400
Oh my god!

666
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:35,620
Wait!

667
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,620
I can woo her!

668
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:37,980
Cause it's red!

669
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:38,740
I think...

670
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,320
I believe...

671
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:39,500
Oh!

672
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,320
Intimacy.

673
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,180
Nice.

674
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,620
Likes and dislikes.

675
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,140
Oh, I don't know anything about her yet.

676
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:45,840
Okay.

677
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:46,720
Not yet.

678
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,460
Unless...

679
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,060
Not yet.

680
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:50,600
Oh wait!

681
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,960
The village does have more people!

682
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:52,320
See?

683
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,480
Look at that!

684
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,000
See?

685
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,560
Not everybody moved away.

686
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,600
Just watching over children.

687
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,300
Hello, sir!

688
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:02,620
Oh look!

689
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:02,960
See?

690
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,860
Look at this village!

691
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,280
Sorry about Suzu.

692
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,440
There's so many people here!

693
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,600
Hello.

694
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,700
I saw it here two days ago.

695
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,720
Wait two...

696
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,540
Super big horns?

697
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,020
Oh wait!

698
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,160
It is my dragon!

699
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,200
Horns?

700
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,180
That it can't be a wooly.

701
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:23,860
Wait!

702
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,860
His name was wooly the entire time?

703
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,460
Oh!

704
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,120
Oh!

705
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:31,460
Oh!

706
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:31,980
Oh!

707
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:32,620
Oh!

708
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:35,160
His name was wooly this entire time!

709
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,060
Oh!

710
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,560
Oh!

711
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:38,440
Oh!

712
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:44,460
Oh!

713
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,460
That's my nickname for him, guys.

714
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,300
That's my nickname.

715
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,580
Okay, Whooply is cute.

716
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,460
That's my...

717
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,500
Whooply the Wooly.

718
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,680
That's what I'm gonna call him.

719
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,240
Whooply the Wooly.

720
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,120
Freaking Whooply Wobbly over here.

721
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,580
Gus, thank you for the super chat.

722
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,440
Thank you, thank you.

723
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,280
You've known her for six months and you only know her name.

724
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:10,180
There's no hope between you two.

725
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,080
Whooply the Wooly.

726
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,860
And then...

727
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,660
And then the dark Wooly is...

728
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,340
Dooply the...

729
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,380
Dooply the Wooly.

730
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,160
D for dark.

731
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,160
Flying rules out Buffamu.

732
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:33,580
I'm starting to think this is a monster I've never seen before.

733
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,920
Oh no, it's my dragon.

734
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,180
I can't find it anywhere.

735
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,000
Wooly.

736
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,820
Wooly and Dooply.

737
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,760
I believe you.

738
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,580
Do you want to keep looking?

739
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,240
Suzu!

740
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,800
Time to come inside!

741
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:49,740
Where is it?

742
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,500
Where is Wooly?

743
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,720
Itoha's calling me.

744
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,420
I better go home.

745
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,060
Even if I don't want to give up yet.

746
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:55,640
Wait.

747
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,660
Will you play with me again tomorrow?

748
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,200
Wait.

749
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,020
Play?

750
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,240
I thought we were trying to find a Wooly.

751
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,400
Wooly's are serious business.

752
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:04,900
Yay!

753
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,180
See you then?

754
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,460
Alright.

755
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:09,720
Alright.

756
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,060
Okay, time to rest.

757
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,080
Okay, I guess it's not.

758
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:12,960
I guess it's sleep time.

759
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:13,780
Sleep time!

760
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,400
Okay, nice.

761
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,480
I'm glad I can run.

762
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,040
Yay!

763
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,060
Alright, let's go back to sleeping.

764
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,820
We ain't playing around, child!

765
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,180
We must find Woobly the Wooly.

766
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,260
Oh, nice.

767
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:30,680
Yoink.

768
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,900
Stealing your herbs.

769
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:33,520
Alright.

770
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:34,560
Sleepy time!

771
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,380
Oh, wait.

772
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:36,880
What's in here?

773
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,920
You can change it to...

774
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,420
I can change it to...

775
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,480
Wait!

776
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,420
I can make it a beach episode!

777
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,320
Nice.

778
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,320
Alright.

779
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,940
It's beach episode time.

780
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,180
Alright.

781
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,320
Sleepy restores your HP and RP.

782
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:55,980
Rune points.

783
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,900
Staying up too late makes you sleepy.

784
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,400
Gradually draining your HP before you finally fall unconscious.

785
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,780
Sleep in your bed before this happens.

786
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,220
Wait!

787
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:09,000
Are there any consequences to fe- Other than health-wise.

788
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:09,840
Uh.

789
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:15,560
Are there any consequences to, like, collapsing in the middle of nowhere?

790
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,060
Oh my god.

791
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:20,740
Wait.

792
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,420
I- Okay, to be fair, I sort of really like her main outfit more.

793
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,000
Like, not Doki's main outfit.

794
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,000
Oh my gosh, her main outfit's so cute too.

795
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:32,920
God damn it.

796
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:33,820
Ah!

797
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:34,660
Alright.

798
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,860
My clothes stay on.

799
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,940
I actually really like her.

800
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,720
I really like her main outfit.

801
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,020
Sleep.

802
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:44,520
Yeah.

803
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,540
Yeah.

804
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,660
My clothes stay on.

805
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,620
Hate me.

806
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:50,500
What?

807
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:52,860
Hello?

808
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,200
Hate me.

809
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,500
Please.

810
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,640
If you can hear my voice.

811
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:00,980
What is that?

812
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:01,740
Woobly?

813
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,160
The woolly?

814
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,200
Woobly, that you?

815
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:07,960
What are you doing outside?

816
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,240
I have five more minutes.

817
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,400
Wait, who are you?

818
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,840
Oh, Earth Dancer.

819
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:16,680
That's me.

820
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:17,680
To the gods.

821
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,200
Blessed Earth, mate.

822
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,700
Hear my plea.

823
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,300
Wait, is this Mako something?

824
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:24,960
Earth.

825
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:25,760
What?

826
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,720
A great shadow looms over this village.

827
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,220
Can I romance you?

828
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,640
My life force is all but spent.

829
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,560
Dancer, I bid you act in my stead.

830
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:40,940
Me?

831
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,340
I offer you my sacred treasure.

832
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,240
Wield its kamiwaza with your dance.

833
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,820
And bring salvation to this village.

834
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,520
I beg of you.

835
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,600
Oh, she likes my dancing.

836
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:55,840
Don't worry.

837
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,140
I shall dance so hard that the village will come back.

838
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,880
Oh, and then the tree is blooming in their vision.

839
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,180
That's like the...

840
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,400
The god tree.

841
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,420
I shall dance for you.

842
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,480
Oh, and that's the drum.

843
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,600
The sacred treasure.

844
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,300
Wooply!

845
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:15,700
The woolly!

846
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,260
Oh, wait, you're not a dragon.

847
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,420
Wait, are you like a sheep dragon?

848
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,020
Finally.

849
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,220
Morning.

850
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,440
Morning.

851
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,420
Wait, you can fly?

852
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,580
Oh, you're so cute.

853
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:32,500
Who?

854
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:33,720
No.

855
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,140
What are you?

856
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,020
Whoa.

857
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,340
Was that called for?

858
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,460
Don't tell me you're...

859
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,380
Yeah, it is him!

860
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,540
It's the white dragon!

861
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,820
Why does he sound like just a guy?

862
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:47,920
Just a fella?

863
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,840
He's just a fella.

864
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,860
He's friend-shaped.

865
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,460
Desi, it's him!

866
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,780
Oh my god.

867
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,240
The Mihoshi Habaki?

868
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,760
I am the ivory one who soars the heavens.

869
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:18,940
Mokoshiro.

870
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:20,980
Moko.

871
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,900
Oh, it's Moko something!

872
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,920
That's the guy I've been dancing for.

873
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,560
Come on!

874
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,460
I'm not saying all that again.

875
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,960
Just call me whatever you want.

876
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,320
Mokoshiro.

877
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,520
Moko something.

878
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,700
I kind of like Woobly.

879
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,420
See, I told you, Woobly!

880
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,560
I knew it!

881
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,680
I was like, there's no way I was butchering his name.

882
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,880
It is Woobly!

883
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,120
Woobly!

884
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,900
Oh my god, I got gasolated by you guys.

885
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,080
Woobly!

886
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,760
Woobly the woody!

887
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:02,090
Woobly!

888
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:02,710
You don't like it?

889
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:05,890
It's... fine.

890
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:06,630
Whatever.

891
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:10,890
Listen, you and I have a much bigger fish to fry at the moment.

892
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:14,510
We've got to track down the black dragon.

893
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,210
Oh, Doobly!

894
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:21,390
Oh my god, we gotta find Doobly, Woobly!

895
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:23,130
What black dragon?

896
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:25,810
No way.

897
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:28,630
Please tell me you're pulling my leg.

898
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:31,690
Why else did I make you an earth dancer?

899
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,450
Because I'm cute.

900
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,430
And...

901
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,530
Earth dancer.

902
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:42,050
That's right.

903
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:44,130
Dance that drum.

904
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,990
But don't keep rage painting.

905
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:50,790
And this is that divine instrument from my dream.

906
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:55,310
I'm supposed to use it in some sort of dance.

907
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:55,790
Yeah.

908
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:57,370
That's what drums are for.

909
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:58,750
You remember now.

910
00:34:59,090 --> 00:34:59,330
Great.

911
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:01,690
There you are.

912
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:02,530
That's me.

913
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:06,590
Do you see that floating a thing behind...

914
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,070
Beside me?

915
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:08,210
Or do I...

916
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:10,050
Or am I going crazy?

917
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:12,130
Some kind of shadowy monster...

918
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:12,670
Hello?

919
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:14,250
You're a...

920
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:15,970
Yay!

921
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:17,350
Beach episode!

922
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:18,870
But you're...

923
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:20,690
Do you not see...

924
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:23,650
The floating dragon next to me?

925
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,050
Oh.

926
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,390
Wait.

927
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:27,910
All right.

928
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:29,550
That's not weird, right?

929
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:35,250
Wait.

930
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,390
Am I going crazy?

931
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:38,570
Or is he...

932
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:39,730
Is he real?

933
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,110
Wait.

934
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:44,750
What am I...

935
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:45,470
Doobly!

936
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,680
Oh my god!

937
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,030
Wait.

938
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:00,110
How come he looks cooler than you, doobly?

939
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,220
He looks so much cooler.

940
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,600
If evil, why cool?

941
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:18,620
Wait.

942
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,740
There's a flying boat?

943
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,280
Oh, she's cute.

944
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,160
Oh, she's cute!

945
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,280
I like her.

946
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,480
Waifu number two.

947
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,460
See that?

948
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,060
See her?

949
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,340
That's my future wife.

950
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,380
Number two.

951
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:45,580
Wait.

952
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,800
What is her weakness?

953
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,980
Why is he sucking up the tree salt?

954
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,260
Yeah, they're trying to destroy the...

955
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:56,940
I mean, we were going to cut the tree anyway, so he's like...

956
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,620
He's basically doing it for free for us.

957
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,980
No, let him keep doing it.

958
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,280
We need to cut it down.

959
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,000
Oh, we did it!

960
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,240
We helped!

961
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,680
Whoa!

962
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,440
Wait, what are you?

963
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,920
Are you like a fox, girl?

964
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:34,720
Hello.

965
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,400
I fell from the sky and I lived.

966
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,540
So, do you see this floating guy next to me, too?

967
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,500
I don't think she sees him.

968
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:54,680
I...

969
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,040
Now...

970
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,260
Now I'm, like, doubting if he's real or not.

971
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,880
Apparently, she's, like, from...

972
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,740
...Factory 5?

973
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,720
Is this sheep real or am I crazy?

974
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,200
Guys, do you guys see him?

975
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,400
He's sort of floating beside me.

976
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,660
Oh my god.

977
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,120
Ooh.

978
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,680
He has a cute outfit, though.

979
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,180
Wait, why doesn't the other girl have a...

980
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,560
...cute intro like him?

981
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:29,560
Skip.

982
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,040
...traveling companion.

983
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:32,980
Hina.

984
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,120
The assistant archaeologist.

985
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,060
Hina.

986
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:35,980
Ugh.

987
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,580
You keep saying it wrong.

988
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,140
Oh, Hina.

989
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,040
It's Hina.

990
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,320
Hina.

991
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,320
Pardon?

992
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,200
You always insist on calling me Mallow, no?

993
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,120
That's a nickname.

994
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,120
Doesn't count.

995
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:48,360
Yeah.

996
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,220
It's a cute nickname, too.

997
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:51,820
Yay!

998
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,220
Oh, she's so cute!

999
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:55,680
Oh.

1000
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:01,630
See, that's how you do an intro, Mario.

1001
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:06,390
At any rate, that black dragon...

1002
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:09,850
How did you know its weakness?

1003
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:12,630
Well,

1004
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,520
um...

1005
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:16,860
Hey!

1006
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,660
Iroha, are you alright?

1007
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,240
Are you okay?

1008
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,300
You seem to be missing your clothes.

1009
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,120
Yeah.

1010
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,660
Suzu and I are fine.

1011
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,640
But the sacred tree...

1012
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,320
It's all right.

1013
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:33,940
Maro.

1014
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:34,980
Sakaki!

1015
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,620
I went to Italian there.

1016
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,100
Thanks to gods, you're safe.

1017
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,080
What was that black dragon?

1018
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,140
Why is she in a bikini?

1019
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:51,060
Well, if you bought a DLC, you can put them all in swimsuit and have your own beach episode.

1020
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,580
Forever and ever.

1021
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,600
A beach episode that never ends.

1022
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:00,200
To think it would descend upon our poor little village.

1023
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:05,200
That dreadful creature has sown calamity across all the possible land.

1024
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,120
It's always beach time.

1025
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,100
They say...

1026
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:09,540
Wait, no!

1027
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,340
It spreads blight bloom spores.

1028
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,660
That's not good.

1029
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,680
Plants that absorb the land's runes.

1030
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,340
No, not the runes!

1031
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:20,140
Our land has been weakened enough already.

1032
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:23,640
At this rate...

1033
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,760
My thing's already dying!

1034
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,360
We're still.

1035
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,580
Our sacred tree was caught in the crossfire.

1036
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,700
The damage is too great.

1037
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,920
You're cutting it down?

1038
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,800
Okay, we're gonna cut it down anyway.

1039
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,880
We should not have stopped the dragon.

1040
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,200
If we lose the tree...

1041
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,260
No, don't cry!

1042
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,780
We can grow another tree, Roa.

1043
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,780
We have no choice, child.

1044
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,160
That's to remove it before it harms someone.

1045
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,520
Let's put Saka Q in the swimsuit.

1046
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:00,720
Wait.

1047
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:04,630
Hmm?

1048
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:05,690
Hmm?

1049
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:07,810
How do I explain this?

1050
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:11,550
The tree god...

1051
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:12,170
Spoke to...

1052
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:14,230
How do I sound less crazy, guys?

1053
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:17,130
The tree god spoke to me in my dreams?

1054
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:17,970
Or...

1055
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:19,310
Let me try something!

1056
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:22,090
Guys, what do you think?

1057
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:22,890
You know what?

1058
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:25,530
I think if I say the tree talked to me...

1059
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:27,670
I'd definitely sound less crazy.

1060
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,800
Considering we disgust her, I can't say I'm surprised.

1061
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,360
Oh, yes!

1062
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,060
I knew it!

1063
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,160
They believed me!

1064
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,560
I knew I were so much...

1065
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,140
I knew I'm not crazy!

1066
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,800
Oh, now you guys see him?

1067
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,280
Woobly!

1068
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,880
You just ditched me, you jerk!

1069
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,540
I can't fly very far like this, you know?

1070
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,120
A talking woolly?

1071
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,160
Woobly, if you know anything about this, please tell me.

1072
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,940
You're a divine messenger, right?

1073
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:08,320
Yeah!

1074
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,720
We can fix this.

1075
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,600
I want to save this village and its guardian deity.

1076
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,380
What do we do?

1077
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,780
How do we kill your brother, doobly?

1078
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,620
Do it for the child.

1079
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:30,380
I, the great Woobly, descendant of the Hoshihabaki, shall impart my wisdom unto you.

1080
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,380
Wait, then why did they, like, ignore him at first?

1081
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,260
Follow me!

1082
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:36,140
Yay!

1083
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,160
Oh my god, we're gonna start farming!

1084
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:40,000
I think this is the farming aspect.

1085
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:44,580
Come to think of it, you said the god gave you an instrument in your dream, right?

1086
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,180
Right.

1087
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,960
She asked me to save this village in her place.

1088
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,840
It's time to farm!

1089
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,520
Then it's time to put that thing to good use!

1090
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:56,060
The god of spring oversees this village.

1091
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:59,100
Her domain includes healing and mirth.

1092
00:42:59,220 --> 00:42:59,520
Okay.

1093
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:04,100
Let's start by giving these blighted trees a healthy dose of cheer!

1094
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:07,440
If I dance in front of the tree, they'll become happy!

1095
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:12,920
That lets you use your rune points to perform the unique ability known as Kamiwaza.

1096
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:15,140
Oh, it's one of the sacred treasures.

1097
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:17,320
I mean, there's a lot of sacred treasures in this game.

1098
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:18,860
It's time to dance.

1099
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:26,640
Use a drum dance to heal or spur growth in plant life, as well as restore blighted land to its former glory.

1100
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,400
All right.

1101
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,160
It's time to dance.

1102
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:31,940
Whoa!

1103
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,060
That's it?

1104
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,200
That's all it tastes?

1105
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:35,840
Oh my god.

1106
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:36,820
I'm such a good dancer.

1107
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:38,660
Oh.

1108
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:41,740
Already?

1109
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:42,940
I got tired already?

1110
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,100
Oh!

1111
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,620
It was two dances!

1112
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,040
Oh, nice.

1113
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:50,600
Pickle tournament.

1114
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:51,980
Uh...

1115
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:52,400
Turnips.

1116
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:54,120
Okay.

1117
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,540
And go to the inventory to use your items.

1118
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:57,720
Uh...

1119
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,440
Oh, and you can naturally regenerate over time.

1120
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,180
I was like...

1121
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:00,440
What?

1122
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,520
I just danced like twice.

1123
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,620
How am I so eepy already?

1124
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:05,400
Wait, no.

1125
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:05,900
I still have...

1126
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:06,080
Oh, wait.

1127
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:06,940
I still have rune points.

1128
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:07,260
Nice.

1129
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,560
That's right.

1130
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,360
I accept tips, trees.

1131
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:14,460
That's right.

1132
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,580
I'll dance for you.

1133
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,360
But I won't dance for free.

1134
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:20,820
Clap!

1135
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,220
Yay!

1136
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:24,120
Did you like that?

1137
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,400
Did you like my dance?

1138
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:30,620
Oh.

1139
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:32,580
Want me to dance for you?

1140
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:33,400
Watch this.

1141
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,300
Watch this.

1142
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:36,660
Okay, wait.

1143
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:38,000
Watch this.

1144
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:38,620
I can still...

1145
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:39,200
Oh, I can't.

1146
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,500
I have to be next to a tree.

1147
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:43,340
Alright.

1148
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:46,760
I did it!

1149
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,920
Wait, is that the tea house?

1150
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,160
Inspect.

1151
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,940
Oh, it's not open yet.

1152
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,680
I'm thirsty.

1153
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,320
I'm so thirsty.

1154
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:02,260
Alright, let's head back.

1155
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:03,780
I danced, guys.

1156
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,560
Oh, I have to dance in front of this.

1157
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,620
Watch this, guys.

1158
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:19,340
With the power of dancing, I shall heal this tree.

1159
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:26,550
I offer these humble words.

1160
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:29,530
Great entity which dwells within this tree.

1161
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:34,750
May your divine glory shine forth and bless us all forevermore.

1162
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:36,730
What?

1163
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:38,850
I did it!

1164
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:39,390
Amazing!

1165
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:40,610
I was like, burn her!

1166
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:42,150
Witch!

1167
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:49,920
It's just that easy.

1168
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,540
Wait, I could have done this in the beginning.

1169
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:53,920
It's just one difference.

1170
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:57,080
Is that what I think it is?

1171
00:45:58,820 --> 00:45:59,800
I knew it.

1172
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:03,000
The gods must have sent you to us for a reason.

1173
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:05,960
I barely did anything.

1174
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,180
Yeah, I just danced.

1175
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,280
Let's hear some phrase...

1176
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:09,480
Let's hear some phrase from the...

1177
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,200
Not for free, though.

1178
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:10,900
The end of the hour.

1179
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,320
Yours truly.

1180
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,820
And you are...

1181
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:17,120
Yeah, I was here for six months.

1182
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:21,400
I could have fixed this on day one.

1183
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,620
I was so tired.

1184
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:25,880
Nickname, Woobly!

1185
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:26,900
Yay!

1186
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:29,100
Woobly!

1187
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:34,000
You both have my deepest gratitude for your tireless efforts.

1188
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,280
Okay, this game is actually pretty fun.

1189
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:36,760
Not gonna...

1190
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,780
Oh my god, it's the goddess!

1191
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:42,660
Wait, is she waifu number three?

1192
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:49,600
Is that waifu number three?

1193
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,480
Oh, she's cute, too.

1194
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,300
Oh my god, she's very cute.

1195
00:46:56,620 --> 00:47:01,120
Within this tree, I preside over Azuma's springtime and merriment.

1196
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:04,600
My followers call me the joyful elegance of spring.

1197
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:08,660
Oh, Doki, she is wife number one.

1198
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,260
She's my goddess.

1199
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:16,620
I had no idea you truly resided within this tree.

1200
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:18,960
You are forgiven, Sakaki.

1201
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,020
You are forgiven.

1202
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,220
I have seen how you felt how dearly you care for this village.

1203
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:29,340
But were I in your position, I surely would have done the same.

1204
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:32,100
You honor me too greatly.

1205
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:36,400
Lord Woobby, Earth Dancer.

1206
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,780
Allow me to thank you once again.

1207
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,500
My sins have been forgiven.

1208
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:47,060
Oh, that's the drum she gave me.

1209
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:52,380
Also, if you guys want to check out the game, feel free to click the link in the chat in the description.

1210
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:55,280
Let's help out a lot, and you can try the game yourself too.

1211
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:58,500
Your drum dance should be more effective now.

1212
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:04,900
Though I am a god, I lost much of my divine strength along with my runes.

1213
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:07,860
Please, Earth Dancer.

1214
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,540
She picked me, guys.

1215
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:11,620
Me.

1216
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,580
I am loyal to Earth Dancer though.

1217
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:16,340
Okay.

1218
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,520
But like, she's a goddess though.

1219
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,500
And she picked me.

1220
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,320
Out of all the villagers here in this town, she picked me.

1221
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:28,660
And I don't even live here.

1222
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,180
That's above my pay grade.

1223
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:34,880
Wait, wait, will she...

1224
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:35,700
Okay, wait, actually.

1225
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:38,520
So my option is, as you wish.

1226
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:39,700
Or...

1227
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,920
That's above my pay grade.

1228
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:42,760
I don't know.

1229
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,000
I feel like we can negotiate something more.

1230
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:45,820
I...

1231
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:50,060
I wanted to know...

1232
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,180
She'll know that I'm assertive, you know?

1233
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,400
Don't ruin...

1234
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,040
Wait, can I...

1235
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:57,240
Can I ruin the round on like, day one?

1236
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:02,540
I got to play hard again, chat.

1237
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:05,180
If I play hard, like, you know...

1238
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:07,860
Goddesses want challenges, guys.

1239
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,120
Oh no, okay.

1240
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,320
That's a God-given request.

1241
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:13,700
She likes the challenge.

1242
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:15,280
The thrill of the chase.

1243
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,020
Please, save our village.

1244
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:20,740
Please.

1245
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:22,880
That's right.

1246
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:25,980
That's right.

1247
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:27,260
I'm not sure how much I can do.

1248
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:30,100
But I'll give it my best effort.

1249
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:32,820
Day one fumble.

1250
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:37,180
I want everyone to ask for my help.

1251
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,000
Wow.

1252
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,040
Boost my ego even more.

1253
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:41,860
Alright.

1254
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:45,190
Oh, wait.

1255
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:45,750
Oh my god.

1256
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:46,570
It went by so fast.

1257
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:47,710
I need to turn auto off.

1258
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:50,390
I thought he was gonna read everything up to me.

1259
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:51,730
And then I realized he skipped.

1260
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:52,610
I...

1261
00:49:56,050 --> 00:50:00,490
Unlocking nodes in a skill tree lets you learn new techniques and increase your stats.

1262
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:06,810
Unlock nodes with experience points, which you can earn by performing a variety of different actions.

1263
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:07,910
Unlock nodes in a skill tree.

1264
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:10,390
So that's my drum.

1265
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:11,830
To generate shock...

1266
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:13,250
Oh, I can use this as an attack.

1267
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:13,890
Yes.

1268
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,320
Use that shockwave.

1269
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:25,140
There's no way I sabotaged my route on day one.

1270
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:26,040
There's no way.

1271
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:27,280
We just met.

1272
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,500
She likes the thrill of the chase, guys.

1273
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:37,440
Goddesses and gods are so used to having things like being given to them.

1274
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:39,560
So that me saying no will be like...

1275
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:41,300
Oh, you're interesting.

1276
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,080
Saying no to a goddess?

1277
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:44,100
Oh.

1278
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,420
So stop enemies in their tracks.

1279
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:51,840
Press to increase.

1280
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:52,240
Okay.

1281
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:53,760
Right click is increase.

1282
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:55,080
It's effect.

1283
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:57,160
Wait, that's not what I want to use.

1284
00:50:57,710 --> 00:50:58,000
Oh.

1285
00:50:58,460 --> 00:50:58,740
Hey.

1286
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,440
I want to use my drum.

1287
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:01,600
What's this?

1288
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:01,900
Oh.

1289
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:02,540
Sorry.

1290
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:03,580
Let me clean real quick.

1291
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:04,460
Hello.

1292
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,300
Wait, why are you crying?

1293
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:10,740
Is it because I said no?

1294
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:12,300
That's right.

1295
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:13,240
Cry some more.

1296
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:16,600
My.

1297
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:19,220
Living a long life has its perks.

1298
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:23,860
The legends about the buxom beauty certainly didn't exaggerate.

1299
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:24,460
Uh-huh.

1300
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:26,760
Whoa.

1301
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:27,360
Whoa.

1302
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:27,720
By the way.

1303
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:28,160
Whoa.

1304
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,600
That's my waifu.

1305
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:31,460
Whoa.

1306
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:32,160
Get up.

1307
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:33,320
Get away from her.

1308
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,660
That's my waifu.

1309
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:42,220
Oh my god.

1310
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:42,600
Wait.

1311
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:43,540
I don't live here though.

1312
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:43,940
Wait.

1313
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:44,620
Is that easy?

1314
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,780
Everyone here knows you.

1315
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:48,940
If you need any help...

1316
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:50,140
Calm down.

1317
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:50,820
Oh jeez.

1318
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:51,600
I need you to assist you.

1319
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:54,280
What do you say?

1320
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,700
Oh my god.

1321
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,700
I loved when you're...

1322
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:59,260
Giving me a position of power?

1323
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:00,900
Sign me up.

1324
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:01,520
What you said, partner?

1325
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:04,460
I see you're starting to remember your calling in life.

1326
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,340
I wouldn't go that far.

1327
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,100
Everyone is like three dudes and a sheep.

1328
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:15,440
And you've taken a load off my shoulders.

1329
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:17,440
Wait, he just wants...

1330
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,040
Wait, I'm doing everybody's job.

1331
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,300
First a shrine and now mayor of this village?

1332
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:25,200
A village chief?

1333
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:26,560
Oh my god.

1334
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:27,620
That's a lot of responsibility.

1335
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,400
I think the goddess would be like...

1336
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:31,420
Ha ha.

1337
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:33,620
You now...

1338
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:35,120
Hello, goddess.

1339
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:37,120
I'm the village chief now.

1340
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:39,500
What do I get?

1341
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:46,190
What is that?

1342
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:47,450
Oh, that's like...

1343
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:49,010
That's like the ancient hoe.

1344
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:51,390
Proof that you're a true earth dancer.

1345
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:53,210
A terra-tiller.

1346
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:56,430
With this, you can till new fields.

1347
00:52:56,650 --> 00:52:57,470
Grow crops...

1348
00:52:57,470 --> 00:52:59,370
Yay, I can farm!

1349
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:02,630
A terra-tiller is my sacred treasure.

1350
00:53:02,730 --> 00:53:04,430
The time to sell it.

1351
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:08,970
Just like with Ulalaka's drum, you'll choose it from the list of sacred treasures in your inventory.

1352
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:11,430
Don't call the Ulalaka ancient.

1353
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:13,170
Wait, isn't that...

1354
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:14,150
It's like...

1355
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:17,250
Okay, Ulalaka's drum.

1356
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:20,090
You'll choose it from the list of sacred treasures in your inventory.

1357
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:21,270
Let's farm!

1358
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:23,930
Okay.

1359
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:25,570
Oh, now I can farm!

1360
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:26,550
Yay!

1361
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:27,590
Finally!

1362
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:31,450
The real content is here.

1363
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:32,470
Oh, I got a rock.

1364
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:33,530
Okay.

1365
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:35,330
Oh, she's gonna teach me how to...

1366
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:36,070
Wait, wait, wait.

1367
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:36,670
Before I...

1368
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:37,010
Oh.

1369
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:37,810
Hello.

1370
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:39,110
Hello, goddess.

1371
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:42,810
You look unhappy.

1372
00:53:43,210 --> 00:53:43,990
What's up?

1373
00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:44,950
Are you okay?

1374
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:46,890
Long have I slept.

1375
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:51,970
I never imagined that the village would fall in such hard times in my absence.

1376
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:53,550
It's okay, Ulalaka.

1377
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:55,510
Ulalaka, I'm here.

1378
00:53:56,830 --> 00:53:59,130
I would happily offer you my assistance.

1379
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:02,130
If only I'd regained my divinity.

1380
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:05,890
Oh, that means we gotta spend more time together, Ulalaka.

1381
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:08,610
Without it, I'm powerless to help.

1382
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:09,150
Don't worry.

1383
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:16,010
I'll spend as many hours, days, weeks together with you so you can get your power back.

1384
00:54:16,570 --> 00:54:19,050
Sounds like a job for the new head honcho.

1385
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:19,570
Pass me!

1386
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:20,810
Guys.

1387
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:24,230
We need to get the village back on its feet as soon as possible.

1388
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:27,150
And I hate seeing Ulalaka so sad.

1389
00:54:27,310 --> 00:54:29,950
I can dance for you, Ulalaka.

1390
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:31,910
Spoken like a true earth dancer.

1391
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:34,270
I've already prepared everything you need.

1392
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:35,730
So, let's hop to it.

1393
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:39,350
Uh...

1394
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:41,730
We gotta do something about this mess out here.

1395
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:42,750
I know.

1396
00:54:42,970 --> 00:54:45,770
Let's clear out everything in a way that makes some farmland.

1397
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:48,410
That'll give us a place to grow some great eats.

1398
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:50,650
Two birds with one stone, yeah?

1399
00:54:51,610 --> 00:54:52,050
Alright.

1400
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:56,770
Peter, thank you for the super chat.

1401
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:57,930
Thank you, thank you.

1402
00:54:58,610 --> 00:55:01,290
Equipping the Tear Tiller will switch you to the Village Builder Mode.

1403
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:04,430
Allowing you to expand the village to dedicate development zone.

1404
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:07,150
While the Tear Tiller equipped, you can...

1405
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:12,050
With the Tear Tiller equipped, you can hold to remove any unneeded objects.

1406
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:12,390
Okay.

1407
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:16,390
Fields are but one type of Tear Tile.

1408
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:19,710
If you want to grow crops, you'll need to place the Field Tiles first.

1409
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:20,430
Remember that.

1410
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:21,570
Alright, that's easy.

1411
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:22,810
Okay.

1412
00:55:23,290 --> 00:55:24,490
I equipped it.

1413
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:27,090
Okay, I can remove this.

1414
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:29,190
Wait, we don't need any rocks here.

1415
00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:29,470
Wait.

1416
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:31,450
There's already, like, stuff here.

1417
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:34,270
Okay, I'm destroying the debris.

1418
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:35,270
I did it!

1419
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:36,910
That's that easy.

1420
00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:39,250
Did you see it?

1421
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:40,430
I'm so strong!

1422
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:46,750
Did you see how strong and reliable I was?

1423
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:49,550
Alright, time to place the Fields.

1424
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:56,010
After equipping the Tear Tiller, press Shift to bring up...

1425
00:55:56,010 --> 00:55:56,310
Not Shift.

1426
00:55:56,450 --> 00:55:58,430
It was a tab to bring up the building menu.

1427
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:02,150
Here, select what you want placed and press F in the spot you want to place it.

1428
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:02,390
Okay.

1429
00:56:03,790 --> 00:56:04,270
Alright.

1430
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:09,190
And then I'll place it here.

1431
00:56:11,350 --> 00:56:11,830
Boop.

1432
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:13,450
Boop.

1433
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:16,410
Wait, why is it not 4?

1434
00:56:18,770 --> 00:56:20,410
Yeah, I did it!

1435
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:21,690
Did you see that, Olaka?

1436
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:22,850
Did you see it?

1437
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:30,030
And don't you think I'm so big and strong and reliable?

1438
00:56:30,990 --> 00:56:33,230
And that I can take care of you?

1439
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:33,890
Alright!

1440
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:36,370
Okay, we'll plant some seed next.

1441
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:37,870
Alright, turnip seeds.

1442
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:40,250
Let's plant those suckers.

1443
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:43,870
Okay, use F to plant...

1444
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:44,810
Oh yeah, that's easy.

1445
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:46,410
Alright.

1446
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:50,150
Building menu.

1447
00:56:50,810 --> 00:56:51,630
Plant time.

1448
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:52,350
Boop.

1449
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:53,290
Boop.

1450
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:54,250
Boop.

1451
00:56:56,510 --> 00:56:59,030
The first step to green thumb, water.

1452
00:56:59,330 --> 00:57:00,250
Your fields daily.

1453
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:02,610
Your seeds and crops won't grow without water.

1454
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:04,830
Neglect them for too long and they might wither away.

1455
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,650
I mean, I just need water every day.

1456
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:07,310
Right?

1457
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:09,010
That's usually how it goes.

1458
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:10,310
Water.

1459
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:12,030
Yeah!

1460
00:57:13,770 --> 00:57:14,690
Look at me.

1461
00:57:14,990 --> 00:57:16,050
I'm so reliable.

1462
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:19,690
Now it's time for the harvest.

1463
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:20,290
Wait, already?

1464
00:57:21,290 --> 00:57:22,410
Maybe not...

1465
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:23,130
Yeah, I was gonna say it.

1466
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:24,830
I'm pretty sure.

1467
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:28,090
Plants don't grow in like 5 seconds.

1468
00:57:29,350 --> 00:57:30,770
See, as we only planted them.

1469
00:57:30,930 --> 00:57:32,170
But there is like turnips over there.

1470
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:37,030
Wait, look at those turnips.

1471
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:38,750
See the shriveled up ones?

1472
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:41,270
And the others that are nearly ready to harvest?

1473
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:41,810
Hey.

1474
00:57:42,830 --> 00:57:45,330
Maybe that drum dance of yours could revive the former.

1475
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:47,530
And help the latter finish growing.

1476
00:57:47,870 --> 00:57:49,350
Wait, so it's okay if they die.

1477
00:57:49,350 --> 00:57:50,890
I can just revive them.

1478
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:52,970
Oh my god.

1479
00:57:54,350 --> 00:57:55,750
Maybe I'm the god.

1480
00:57:56,970 --> 00:57:59,490
I can just let them die and revive it.

1481
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:01,570
Over and over again.

1482
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:04,290
Help your crops and trees grow faster.

1483
00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:08,050
That dance will only work on each target once per day though.

1484
00:58:08,870 --> 00:58:09,430
Yeah, see?

1485
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:11,330
They'll never die.

1486
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:14,950
Holy, they'll even produce seeds.

1487
00:58:15,210 --> 00:58:15,390
Alright.

1488
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:17,490
It's time to play god.

1489
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:19,890
Equip the drum.

1490
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:20,670
Okay.

1491
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:23,790
You like my dance?

1492
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:24,390
Woo!

1493
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:26,290
Yay!

1494
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:29,030
Alright, let's harvest it.

1495
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:32,970
Finally a doki-proof farming game.

1496
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:35,370
Oh yeah, that's a nice haul.

1497
00:58:37,070 --> 00:58:38,890
And you got some seeds.

1498
00:58:39,870 --> 00:58:41,950
You'll get seeds when harvesting crops.

1499
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:45,270
That's important info right there, so make sure you remember it.

1500
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:45,490
Yes!

1501
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:48,230
All we gotta do now is ship them!

1502
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:49,650
Okay.

1503
00:58:50,070 --> 00:58:52,390
Wait, I wanna harvest all the turnips first.

1504
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:57,110
Wait, I might as well like plant the other seeds too.

1505
00:58:58,850 --> 00:58:59,370
Uh...

1506
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:00,330
How do I do this again?

1507
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:03,230
Um...

1508
00:59:03,930 --> 00:59:04,590
Okay, there you go.

1509
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:05,150
Building.

1510
00:59:05,490 --> 00:59:05,810
Yeah.

1511
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:07,410
And then...

1512
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:09,190
Boop, boop, boop, boop.

1513
00:59:12,030 --> 00:59:13,510
I have so much power.

1514
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:16,390
I can bring back any of them from the dead.

1515
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:19,250
Okay, and then that should be...

1516
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:20,890
Wait, how do I...

1517
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:21,990
Alright, nice.

1518
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:24,830
Okay, put turnips in the shipping shed.

1519
00:59:24,990 --> 00:59:25,530
It's over here.

1520
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:29,430
Uh...

1521
00:59:29,430 --> 00:59:30,670
Oh my god, 45?

1522
00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:32,750
That's so much money!

1523
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:38,230
Any items placed in the shipping shed will be sold off automatically by the next morning.

1524
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:39,410
Netting your profit.

1525
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:41,030
This includes harvested crops.

1526
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:43,370
That's so much money!

1527
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:45,250
That's like more than 10.

1528
00:59:46,490 --> 00:59:49,050
Remember, toss anything you want to sell in here.

1529
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:51,870
Once it ships, you'll earn a nice little profit.

1530
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:52,390
Alright!

1531
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:54,990
Let's keep this ball rolling!

1532
00:59:55,910 --> 00:59:56,390
Huh?

1533
00:59:56,750 --> 00:59:58,110
We're out of field tiles?

1534
00:59:58,330 --> 00:59:58,710
Already?

1535
00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:00,450
No sweat.

1536
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:01,690
We'll make some ourselves.

1537
01:00:02,610 --> 01:00:03,090
Um...

1538
01:00:03,090 --> 01:00:04,890
First, we need the necessary materials.

1539
01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:07,470
Since I'm feeling extra generous...

1540
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:09,470
I'll provide them just this once.

1541
01:00:09,730 --> 01:00:10,450
Leave it to me!

1542
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:13,150
All you have to do is call me whenever you want to make tiles.

1543
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:13,670
Okay.

1544
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:20,270
Call Woobly to create the various Terran tiles you can use in Village Builder Mode.

1545
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:22,590
You must have the Terran Tiller to equip.

1546
01:00:22,770 --> 01:00:24,210
Wait, how many can I get?

1547
01:00:24,730 --> 01:00:26,130
Oh, I got a path recipe!

1548
01:00:26,130 --> 01:00:27,430
Oh, you can have like...

1549
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:30,390
Customization and stuff.

1550
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:31,830
With the paths and stuff.

1551
01:00:33,110 --> 01:00:33,490
Okay.

1552
01:00:34,370 --> 01:00:35,870
How do I call Woobly?

1553
01:00:36,430 --> 01:00:39,230
Wait, let me dance for these plants real quick.

1554
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:40,910
Yeah, plants?

1555
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:41,630
You like that?

1556
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:42,410
Whoa!

1557
01:00:42,910 --> 01:00:44,230
Yeah, you like that, plants?

1558
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:45,070
Whoa!

1559
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:48,130
Don't worry.

1560
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:49,930
I'll dance for you too!

1561
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:52,710
Okay.

1562
01:00:54,330 --> 01:00:55,170
Terran Tiller.

1563
01:00:57,090 --> 01:00:58,590
Oh, I call for him again?

1564
01:00:58,810 --> 01:00:59,470
Oh, call Woobly.

1565
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:01,950
Oh, I forgot to water them.

1566
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:02,890
Wait, give me a sec.

1567
01:01:03,650 --> 01:01:05,230
Let me water them real quick.

1568
01:01:08,430 --> 01:01:08,870
Building.

1569
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:09,530
What?

1570
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:09,850
No.

1571
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:10,790
No!

1572
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:13,650
Okay.

1573
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:17,960
Wait, why can't...

1574
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:18,520
Oh my god!

1575
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:19,400
Woobly, please!

1576
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:20,620
I want no water!

1577
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,100
Wait, have I already watered them?

1578
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:26,660
Or maybe I have watered it.

1579
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:29,540
Oh, dancing automatically waters.

1580
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:30,140
Oh, okay.

1581
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:30,640
That's great.

1582
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:32,100
Wait, I don't have to do any work.

1583
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:33,480
I can just dance.

1584
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:34,860
Oh my god!

1585
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:37,100
All I have to do is dance!

1586
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,840
Oh, just keep dancing and never stop.

1587
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:44,640
I'll never have to work again.

1588
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:46,260
Morning!

1589
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:47,880
Let's get up and at it again!

1590
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:49,300
What's up?

1591
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:50,440
Okay, I need Terran Tiller.

1592
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:52,020
So, which do you want to make?

1593
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:54,800
Dancing solves all my problems.

1594
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,920
Quires rich in nutrients.

1595
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,020
Hey, I feel like...

1596
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:02,260
I'm land free.

1597
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,280
What should I get?

1598
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:07,880
Oh, I need red soil.

1599
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,960
Oh, I need red soil to make...

1600
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:10,840
Oh, okay.

1601
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:11,820
How many do I need?

1602
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:14,180
Two.

1603
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:16,140
I already have red soil.

1604
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:16,960
I don't have to make that.

1605
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:17,680
Alright.

1606
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:22,540
Just keep dancing.

1607
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:26,720
Never stop dancing.

1608
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:30,900
Ah, a true masterpiece if I do say so myself.

1609
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:33,700
Now just do everything I taught you thus far.

1610
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:37,100
First, throw down a field tile and plant some seeds.

1611
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:39,220
You don't have to harvest them this time.

1612
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:41,460
Come on, let's plant more turnip seeds.

1613
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:42,540
Okay, nice.

1614
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:44,580
Let's plant it here.

1615
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,440
Oh, I want to remove this though.

1616
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,220
This would be my turnip field.

1617
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:51,760
Alright.

1618
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,160
Dance, Stokey.

1619
01:02:59,320 --> 01:02:59,640
Dance!

1620
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:02,220
Alright.

1621
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:04,240
And then...

1622
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,040
God, I'm like missing one right here.

1623
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:06,900
This...

1624
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:08,340
Oh, that tilts me a little bit.

1625
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Just a little.

1626
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,040
It's literally just one.

1627
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,300
It's just right there.

1628
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:18,200
That's what I'm talking about.

1629
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,380
You've really got a knack for this.

1630
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:21,260
Yay!

1631
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:22,560
Oh my goodness.

1632
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:25,280
Thank you so much, Earth Dancer.

1633
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:27,440
Yes.

1634
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:29,700
This might just be enough.

1635
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:31,260
Oh my gosh.

1636
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:31,780
She's getting...

1637
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:33,960
She's getting stronger with every turnip I grow.

1638
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:38,160
What's she doing?

1639
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:43,440
Oh my god.

1640
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:45,500
She leveled me up.

1641
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:46,880
Oh my god.

1642
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:47,560
She loves me.

1643
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:48,320
Oh my god.

1644
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:49,460
She's obsessed with me.

1645
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:50,540
Guys, I'm in.

1646
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:51,940
I'm in, guys.

1647
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:53,440
I feel like I just had a huge boost of energy.

1648
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:58,080
Guys, I'm in.

1649
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,960
Proof positive that her divinity's back.

1650
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:02,240
Wow.

1651
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:04,000
Thank you, Ulalaka.

1652
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,440
I'm so in.

1653
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:11,080
I have another request, Earth Dancer.

1654
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:11,500
Yeah?

1655
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:14,920
If you could spare the time, would you help me...

1656
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:15,380
Of course!

1657
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:20,640
As a village chief that just got nominated today by all the villagers.

1658
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:21,780
So you know I'm very popular.

1659
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:25,020
I'll do anything for you.

1660
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:26,320
That would return my divinity.

1661
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:27,240
Anything.

1662
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:27,920
Anything.

1663
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,920
Even there.

1664
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:34,220
As the new village chief, it would be my pleasure.

1665
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:34,660
Yay!

1666
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:36,880
My humble thanks.

1667
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:41,220
I can't express how relieved I am to have an young dancer like you.

1668
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:42,000
See?

1669
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:43,360
Like me, guys.

1670
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:44,300
Like me!

1671
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:46,780
I'm so in.

1672
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:53,920
As the village level increases, the god that watched over the village will regain the divinity and reward you a new blessing.

1673
01:04:54,220 --> 01:04:56,900
Speak to the gods when the village is ready to level up.

1674
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,000
Alright, head to the dragon's trying to sleep.

1675
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:00,860
Oh, it's sleep time?

1676
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:01,980
What time is it now?

1677
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:04,040
Okay, give me a sec.

1678
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:04,980
I gotta dance.

1679
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:07,100
Oh.

1680
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:08,080
Oh no.

1681
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:08,700
I'm so tired.

1682
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:09,680
Wait, I just need like...

1683
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:10,220
Don't worry.

1684
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:14,020
It says gradually I'll get my RP back.

1685
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:15,560
Come on.

1686
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:16,800
Come on.

1687
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:17,620
I just need...

1688
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:18,120
Oh my gosh.

1689
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:19,060
Fine!

1690
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:22,980
I'll water these plants like a peasant.

1691
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:24,140
My thanks.

1692
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:25,240
Alright.

1693
01:05:25,620 --> 01:05:26,760
Oh my god.

1694
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:30,040
I can't believe I had to use my hands.

1695
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:31,920
And it's not for dancing.

1696
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:32,740
Hey!

1697
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,580
No, I gotta save my food, guys.

1698
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:40,180
You only carry a limited number of items after reaching your limit.

1699
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:43,580
Any items you pick up will go straight to the storage box or the dragon's trying.

1700
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:45,240
Wait, I wanna...

1701
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:46,860
See?

1702
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:47,960
Okay, can he...

1703
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:48,740
Oh my god.

1704
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:50,680
It will...

1705
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:51,820
The beach...

1706
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:52,740
No, you put clothes on.

1707
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:54,400
The beach episode will never...

1708
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:00,760
Oh, I actually like her main outfit more.

1709
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:01,580
I'm sorry, guys.

1710
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:03,760
Her main outfit is so cute.

1711
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:08,100
Oh, guys.

1712
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:13,820
It's so difficult because, like, her swimsuit's cute, too.

1713
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:16,920
But her main outfit is also very...

1714
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:17,900
Okay, I'm gonna do a swimsuit.

1715
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:18,380
Alright.

1716
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:22,620
Yeah, the main outfit is so cute.

1717
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:23,120
Oh.

1718
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:25,980
Oh, man.

1719
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:26,940
It's so difficult.

1720
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:27,520
Yeah.

1721
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:32,800
Oh, their designs are...

1722
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:33,660
Oh, my God, it's so cute.

1723
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:34,640
I can't help it.

1724
01:06:35,660 --> 01:06:38,080
I really like the colors combination.

1725
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:42,420
Alright.

1726
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:46,100
Give me a sec, guys.

1727
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:47,140
You know what?

1728
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:48,500
I'm gonna go with my gut.

1729
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:50,980
The never-ending beach episode.

1730
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,220
Alright, let's save real quick.

1731
01:06:56,380 --> 01:07:00,120
Yeah, I really like both the default outfits and the swimsuit DLC.

1732
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:01,660
They're both really, really cute.

1733
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,320
I love the designs in this game.

1734
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:06,360
Alright.

1735
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:07,120
I'll sleep.

1736
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:07,540
Oh, wait.

1737
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:07,940
You're right.

1738
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:08,980
You're right.

1739
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:09,500
I gotta...

1740
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:10,260
I wanna check...

1741
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:11,280
Check it out myself.

1742
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:14,140
I gotta be sure I'm making the right choice, guys.

1743
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:16,640
Collect some herbs.

1744
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:18,020
Just some green grass.

1745
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:21,600
I gotta be sure I'm making the right decision.

1746
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:23,420
Oh, my God.

1747
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:25,860
You need a...

1748
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:28,860
Do you want me to chaperone you to the beach, ma'am?

1749
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:29,700
My thanks.

1750
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:32,900
Don't worry.

1751
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:34,860
I'll guard you.

1752
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:39,220
Alright, let's head to bed.

1753
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:41,800
Chee-e-pee now.

1754
01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:43,620
Goodnight.

1755
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:45,920
Uh, Carl, thank you for the super chat.

1756
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:46,180
Thank you.

1757
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:46,800
Thank you.

1758
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:47,920
You're a stokey.

1759
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,960
Will you bless us with a future stream of Mind's Eye?

1760
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:50,320
Which...

1761
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:51,000
What's Mind's Eye?

1762
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:53,600
Thank you for the super chat.

1763
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:53,880
Thank you.

1764
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:54,520
Thank you.

1765
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:55,820
Is that what...

1766
01:07:55,820 --> 01:07:56,020
Is that...

1767
01:07:56,020 --> 01:07:56,260
Oh, wait.

1768
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:57,940
That's the newest game that came out.

1769
01:07:57,940 --> 01:07:59,040
I think I've heard about it.

1770
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:00,880
Um...

1771
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:01,240
Oh, yeah.

1772
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:04,200
Do you want me to help you put sunscreen on?

1773
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:05,120
Sunscreen on?

1774
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:07,480
The sun is so bright.

1775
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:09,040
We don't wanna...

1776
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:12,840
We don't wanna hurt your delicate skin, goddess.

1777
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:19,680
When you go to sleep, you'll receive a breakdown of your actions that day.

1778
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:24,620
Each category will be tallied up and you'll earn cumulative amount of all-purpose experience points.

1779
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:25,320
Use...

1780
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:27,020
Oh, I can upgrade my skill tree.

1781
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,740
I'm here to treat you like a goddess.

1782
01:08:33,180 --> 01:08:34,200
That you deserve.

1783
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:37,000
Yeah.

1784
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:41,400
Why don't we ask Sakaki if we can help with anything?

1785
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:43,100
Oh, yeah.

1786
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:47,140
He never really, like, told me what my duties are as village chief.

1787
01:08:50,610 --> 01:08:51,130
Hello?

1788
01:08:52,810 --> 01:08:54,070
What do you want me to do?

1789
01:08:54,790 --> 01:08:57,490
No, you've got to stop pushing yourself.

1790
01:08:58,050 --> 01:09:00,450
Can't you ask someone else to handle it for you?

1791
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:02,910
Let me go, Iloha.

1792
01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:03,890
Wait, where is he going?

1793
01:09:04,710 --> 01:09:08,450
I may be old now, but I was once known as the demon one.

1794
01:09:08,450 --> 01:09:08,650
What?

1795
01:09:08,970 --> 01:09:09,170
You?

1796
01:09:09,510 --> 01:09:10,550
This is nothing for us.

1797
01:09:12,670 --> 01:09:14,730
Yeah, I was gonna say, demon what?

1798
01:09:17,490 --> 01:09:18,050
See?

1799
01:09:18,550 --> 01:09:19,770
What did I tell you?

1800
01:09:19,770 --> 01:09:20,870
Yeah, old man.

1801
01:09:21,270 --> 01:09:22,210
Go back to bed.

1802
01:09:22,590 --> 01:09:24,410
The real village chief is here.

1803
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:26,290
Let me know how I can help.

1804
01:09:28,070 --> 01:09:29,910
Such a kind soul.

1805
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:35,450
Our carpenter Takumi left a few days ago and hasn't come back.

1806
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:36,150
Oh, wait.

1807
01:09:36,330 --> 01:09:37,070
No, our carpenter.

1808
01:09:37,470 --> 01:09:38,750
We only have one?

1809
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:43,390
I thought I'd ask him to repair the dragon shrine since you're staying there.

1810
01:09:44,070 --> 01:09:45,490
It's been six months.

1811
01:09:45,490 --> 01:09:47,690
How long has he been missing, Sakagi?

1812
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:53,870
Sakagi, how long has this man been missing?

1813
01:09:54,670 --> 01:09:56,910
The curse of old age.

1814
01:09:57,690 --> 01:09:58,670
Oh, I know.

1815
01:09:58,950 --> 01:10:00,870
Our new chief could look for Takumi.

1816
01:10:01,350 --> 01:10:02,110
What do you say?

1817
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:06,590
I'm sorry, but now isn't a good time.

1818
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:09,110
Okay, we do have to fix the hole in the roof.

1819
01:10:10,130 --> 01:10:10,330
Great.

1820
01:10:10,330 --> 01:10:11,690
I'm glad you're so reliable.

1821
01:10:11,690 --> 01:10:12,750
Certainly, I hope he's hard.

1822
01:10:13,450 --> 01:10:13,850
All right.

1823
01:10:14,230 --> 01:10:15,450
Yay, I'm reliable.

1824
01:10:16,030 --> 01:10:16,910
I have you on the search.

1825
01:10:18,190 --> 01:10:21,930
Takumi went looking for materials in the abandoned shrine to the north.

1826
01:10:22,970 --> 01:10:25,550
I'll ask the gatekeeper to open a way for you.

1827
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:28,550
Oh, really?

1828
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:29,030
Oh.

1829
01:10:30,650 --> 01:10:32,050
Before you go, take these with you.

1830
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:34,150
It should be useful for gathering.

1831
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:35,150
Oh, I got a hammer.

1832
01:10:35,410 --> 01:10:36,190
A cheap hammer.

1833
01:10:36,930 --> 01:10:40,070
Now that you have a hammer, you can mine or deposits to collect materials.

1834
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:41,010
stone and ore.

1835
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:43,070
Or deposits will spawn after a day.

1836
01:10:43,310 --> 01:10:44,830
Oh, and I got a tree cutter.

1837
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:50,050
Now that you have a hatchet, you can chop wood to harvest lumber, saplings, and more.

1838
01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:52,190
You can only harvest from fully grown trees.

1839
01:10:52,470 --> 01:10:53,850
I know what tree is full.

1840
01:10:57,530 --> 01:10:58,830
Where's the gray tree?

1841
01:11:01,570 --> 01:11:02,950
Wait, can I get rid of this?

1842
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:06,930
Wait, I'll dance.

1843
01:11:07,970 --> 01:11:09,090
Okay, dancing did nothing.

1844
01:11:09,090 --> 01:11:10,550
Oh, I can lock more nodes.

1845
01:11:10,710 --> 01:11:10,930
Oh, yeah.

1846
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:15,790
Sacred tree ring.

1847
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:21,470
Wait, do I have enough XP for it?

1848
01:11:23,910 --> 01:11:28,750
I suspect your waifu wouldn't be happy if you did that.

1849
01:11:29,210 --> 01:11:29,750
It's okay.

1850
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:32,610
She's not here.

1851
01:11:33,730 --> 01:11:35,170
Oh, I found the tree, guys.

1852
01:11:35,550 --> 01:11:36,270
It's time.

1853
01:11:37,530 --> 01:11:38,470
Oh, she's ready.

1854
01:11:38,890 --> 01:11:40,290
Guys, she won't know.

1855
01:11:42,910 --> 01:11:43,670
Don't worry.

1856
01:11:44,150 --> 01:11:45,310
She won't know.

1857
01:11:48,690 --> 01:11:50,110
Spec, thank you for the super chat.

1858
01:11:50,230 --> 01:11:50,450
Thank you.

1859
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:50,970
Thank you.

1860
01:11:51,310 --> 01:11:51,890
Hi, Toki.

1861
01:11:52,010 --> 01:11:53,130
Thanks for playing Rune Factory.

1862
01:11:53,390 --> 01:11:55,530
I love the series and it's great seeing you get attention.

1863
01:11:55,790 --> 01:11:56,990
Hope everyone gives it a try.

1864
01:11:57,150 --> 01:11:58,270
My favorite is for it.

1865
01:11:58,390 --> 01:11:59,110
Have a good night.

1866
01:11:59,370 --> 01:12:00,110
Thank you for the super chat.

1867
01:12:00,110 --> 01:12:00,410
Thank you.

1868
01:12:00,530 --> 01:12:00,930
Thank you.

1869
01:12:01,130 --> 01:12:01,390
Yeah.

1870
01:12:01,530 --> 01:12:06,950
If you guys want to check it out, feel free to click on the link in the chat, in the pin in the chat and in the description.

1871
01:12:07,210 --> 01:12:08,430
I mean, it's been pretty fun so far.

1872
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:09,470
I'm actually enjoying it.

1873
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:12,690
And then we've only just like been in the beginning of the game.

1874
01:12:15,110 --> 01:12:17,850
Stop self-sabotaging your romance.

1875
01:12:19,130 --> 01:12:20,710
I can't help it.

1876
01:12:20,830 --> 01:12:26,010
When it's too good to be true, I have to, I have to self-sabotage.

1877
01:12:27,050 --> 01:12:29,230
Because I don't deserve love.

1878
01:12:31,190 --> 01:12:35,590
You were about to start searching for Takumi without a single Onigiri for the road.

1879
01:12:36,710 --> 01:12:38,070
You brought us some?

1880
01:12:40,330 --> 01:12:41,290
To Ria.

1881
01:12:42,190 --> 01:12:42,410
Nice.

1882
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:47,210
Hey, why are you making us do the hard work?

1883
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:52,310
I mean, I was planning to bring some when it suddenly hit me.

1884
01:12:52,310 --> 01:12:54,410
Look, she's a goddess, guys.

1885
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:56,370
She has such high expectations.

1886
01:12:56,730 --> 01:13:00,210
What if I don't satisfy her expectations, guys?

1887
01:13:00,430 --> 01:13:05,770
I gotta end it before she realized I was not the right earth dancer.

1888
01:13:09,090 --> 01:13:11,650
Do you even know how to make Onigiri?

1889
01:13:12,090 --> 01:13:13,670
Yeah, it's like a donut.

1890
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:16,970
Now that you mention it, no.

1891
01:13:18,670 --> 01:13:21,150
You've forgotten that, of all things?

1892
01:13:21,910 --> 01:13:26,010
Just like I thought, I've got the recipe and all the materials right here.

1893
01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:27,190
So give it a shot.

1894
01:13:28,010 --> 01:13:30,070
You can't fight on an empty stomach.

1895
01:13:30,970 --> 01:13:31,830
Oh, nice.

1896
01:13:32,290 --> 01:13:33,550
Aw, she's making food.

1897
01:13:33,730 --> 01:13:35,650
Aw, look at him.

1898
01:13:35,790 --> 01:13:37,310
He's like, oh my god.

1899
01:13:37,530 --> 01:13:39,550
She's gonna make me an Onigiri.

1900
01:13:40,170 --> 01:13:42,590
Okay, so I can make food at the teahouse.

1901
01:13:42,730 --> 01:13:44,690
Collect recipes to expand your cooking repertoire.

1902
01:13:45,450 --> 01:13:47,210
Cooking can restore HP and RP.

1903
01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:49,250
And grant temporary stat increases.

1904
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:51,390
Okay, so they expire after a day.

1905
01:13:52,210 --> 01:13:52,730
Okay.

1906
01:13:53,730 --> 01:13:54,250
Nice.

1907
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:55,770
Follow the recipe exactly.

1908
01:13:56,150 --> 01:13:57,510
Am I doing it right?

1909
01:13:57,730 --> 01:13:58,090
Yeah!

1910
01:13:58,510 --> 01:14:00,330
My stomach's rumbling like crazy.

1911
01:14:00,590 --> 01:14:01,770
I got Onigiri.

1912
01:14:02,350 --> 01:14:04,430
Not bad for someone who forgot how to make them.

1913
01:14:04,770 --> 01:14:05,790
I did it.

1914
01:14:06,010 --> 01:14:06,170
See?

1915
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:07,190
I can cook.

1916
01:14:07,510 --> 01:14:08,890
Did you see that, Ulaka?

1917
01:14:09,770 --> 01:14:11,050
I can cook.

1918
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:11,950
No kidding.

1919
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:15,050
Though I'd argue that you had a great teacher.

1920
01:14:16,490 --> 01:14:17,010
I did it.

1921
01:14:17,010 --> 01:14:22,050
As a reward for mastering the way of the Onigiri, I'll give you extra ingredients to make more...

1922
01:14:22,050 --> 01:14:22,130
Yay!

1923
01:14:22,830 --> 01:14:23,530
Freeing food!

1924
01:14:24,370 --> 01:14:25,130
It's so simple.

1925
01:14:25,130 --> 01:14:27,230
You only need a bonfire to prepare them.

1926
01:14:27,590 --> 01:14:28,030
Oh, nice.

1927
01:14:28,050 --> 01:14:29,110
Give it a try if you find one.

1928
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:31,590
Thank you for all the help, Iroha.

1929
01:14:32,790 --> 01:14:34,050
Good luck out there.

1930
01:14:34,350 --> 01:14:36,210
Bring back Takami in one piece.

1931
01:14:36,270 --> 01:14:36,850
Don't worry.

1932
01:14:37,130 --> 01:14:37,710
I will.

1933
01:14:38,350 --> 01:14:40,170
Do the pieces have to be attached?

1934
01:14:42,270 --> 01:14:42,810
All right.

1935
01:14:42,910 --> 01:14:43,850
Oh, I got Seam Race.

1936
01:14:44,310 --> 01:14:44,870
And Salt.

1937
01:14:45,050 --> 01:14:46,310
Oh, that's for my Onigiri.

1938
01:14:46,730 --> 01:14:47,090
All right.

1939
01:14:47,130 --> 01:14:49,350
This is the RPG element of it now.

1940
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:55,120
Spring Highlands.

1941
01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:59,640
Oh, and there's like apparently a lot of different locations around Rune Factory to explore.

1942
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:01,700
So this is like not the only area here.

1943
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:03,880
Anesia Whale.

1944
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:07,920
While the range isn't very impressive, they hit fast enough to keep enemies on the back.

1945
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:10,380
But making it harder for them to strike back.

1946
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:11,640
Okay.

1947
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:14,420
Oh, free stuff.

1948
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:16,280
Wait, how do I...

1949
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:17,120
I want to cut this.

1950
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:19,000
What's this?

1951
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:20,740
Get a load of this blight.

1952
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:21,700
Oh.

1953
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:24,300
Wait, why am I sweeping the woods?

1954
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:26,420
Oh, nice.

1955
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:27,140
Someone...

1956
01:15:27,140 --> 01:15:30,500
Let me steal the Onigiri from the stride.

1957
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:31,720
Oh, man.

1958
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:33,800
I am such a good person.

1959
01:15:34,340 --> 01:15:34,660
Let me...

1960
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:37,060
Wow.

1961
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:38,440
Wow.

1962
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:40,840
What?

1963
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,420
They're not gonna eat it.

1964
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:44,740
It's a waste of good food.

1965
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:46,760
Beware of oil.

1966
01:15:47,380 --> 01:15:48,120
What's this?

1967
01:15:51,290 --> 01:15:51,930
Look.

1968
01:15:52,490 --> 01:15:54,930
They're offering the Onigiri to me.

1969
01:15:56,890 --> 01:15:58,050
Oh, a treasure chest.

1970
01:15:58,670 --> 01:15:59,710
Can we just open it?

1971
01:16:01,270 --> 01:16:04,450
Surely no bad luck's gonna happen to me, right guys?

1972
01:16:06,110 --> 01:16:06,790
Why not?

1973
01:16:06,950 --> 01:16:09,350
It's practically begging for us to take a peek.

1974
01:16:12,030 --> 01:16:13,930
Yeah, I got a runin' hat.

1975
01:16:14,890 --> 01:16:15,710
New hat.

1976
01:16:17,470 --> 01:16:18,630
Want to try it on?

1977
01:16:19,130 --> 01:16:20,130
Oh, yeah.

1978
01:16:22,150 --> 01:16:24,530
The appearance option lets you adjust the looks of your equipment.

1979
01:16:26,390 --> 01:16:29,210
Changing the parameters or effects of what you've equipped.

1980
01:16:29,450 --> 01:16:29,570
Okay.

1981
01:16:30,590 --> 01:16:31,390
Yeah, new hat.

1982
01:16:32,490 --> 01:16:33,030
Here.

1983
01:16:34,350 --> 01:16:34,890
Appearance.

1984
01:16:37,670 --> 01:16:38,750
Wait, actually...

1985
01:16:39,350 --> 01:16:40,690
No, I like...

1986
01:16:40,690 --> 01:16:42,990
Okay, but I can have equipment.

1987
01:16:43,570 --> 01:16:43,930
So...

1988
01:16:43,930 --> 01:16:44,510
Oh, no.

1989
01:16:44,750 --> 01:16:44,890
Oh.

1990
01:16:45,410 --> 01:16:47,990
No, I can wear this, but it doesn't show up.

1991
01:16:48,010 --> 01:16:48,810
Oh, I like that.

1992
01:16:48,990 --> 01:16:50,430
So you can customize your...

1993
01:16:51,290 --> 01:16:51,730
Um...

1994
01:16:51,730 --> 01:16:53,970
You can customize your, like, um...

1995
01:16:53,970 --> 01:16:55,030
The appearance more.

1996
01:16:55,550 --> 01:16:56,430
I like that.

1997
01:16:56,630 --> 01:16:58,350
So you don't like the gear.

1998
01:16:58,650 --> 01:16:59,850
You don't have to have it on.

1999
01:17:00,350 --> 01:17:02,270
So it can be aesthetically pleasing.

2000
01:17:03,050 --> 01:17:03,670
That's right.

2001
01:17:04,930 --> 01:17:06,110
He was just...

2002
01:17:06,110 --> 01:17:07,150
Did you see him?

2003
01:17:09,370 --> 01:17:11,270
He shot me first, guys.

2004
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:12,790
It was self-defense.

2005
01:17:15,890 --> 01:17:16,490
Guys.

2006
01:17:16,930 --> 01:17:18,730
It was self-defense, guys.

2007
01:17:22,990 --> 01:17:24,950
He ran at me first.

2008
01:17:25,790 --> 01:17:26,070
Yay.

2009
01:17:26,370 --> 01:17:27,270
I'm leveled up.

2010
01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:27,990
Yay.

2011
01:17:28,170 --> 01:17:29,250
Oh, I can mine too.

2012
01:17:29,530 --> 01:17:30,150
I need this orb.

2013
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:33,750
He was coming right at me.

2014
01:17:35,930 --> 01:17:37,310
I didn't want...

2015
01:17:37,310 --> 01:17:38,510
I didn't want it.

2016
01:17:38,890 --> 01:17:40,490
I didn't want to do it, guys.

2017
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:42,190
What's this?

2018
01:17:42,670 --> 01:17:43,710
Oh, the bridge is out.

2019
01:17:46,730 --> 01:17:48,430
Did anyone leave an onigiri here?

2020
01:17:49,470 --> 01:17:50,550
Oh, Earth Dancer.

2021
01:17:50,850 --> 01:17:52,930
Your dance has brought me joy and happiness.

2022
01:17:53,430 --> 01:17:54,070
Congrats, dude.

2023
01:17:54,370 --> 01:17:56,230
Let me pursue you upon this recipe.

2024
01:17:56,750 --> 01:17:57,070
Oh.

2025
01:17:57,430 --> 01:17:59,050
Oh, I can make more turnip soup.

2026
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:00,730
Ribbit?

2027
01:18:01,030 --> 01:18:01,330
Hmm?

2028
01:18:02,330 --> 01:18:03,310
What was that?

2029
01:18:05,150 --> 01:18:05,690
Huh?

2030
01:18:06,550 --> 01:18:07,490
Wait, who...

2031
01:18:07,490 --> 01:18:09,210
What's a kid doing outside the village?

2032
01:18:09,390 --> 01:18:09,830
I know.

2033
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:10,690
A child.

2034
01:18:11,390 --> 01:18:11,550
Oh.

2035
01:18:12,650 --> 01:18:13,330
Hey, you there.

2036
01:18:13,890 --> 01:18:16,330
I saw you doing a weird dance.

2037
01:18:16,810 --> 01:18:16,930
Hey.

2038
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:18,790
Ever heard of frog statues?

2039
01:18:19,450 --> 01:18:19,610
Yes.

2040
01:18:19,610 --> 01:18:22,290
Just who even are you?

2041
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:23,790
Me?

2042
01:18:24,170 --> 01:18:25,390
I'm croaky.

2043
01:18:26,090 --> 01:18:30,110
People call me the frog statue fanatic.

2044
01:18:30,270 --> 01:18:30,410
Hey.

2045
01:18:31,350 --> 01:18:34,250
But more importantly, do you like frog statues?

2046
01:18:34,930 --> 01:18:36,050
Well, do you?

2047
01:18:36,970 --> 01:18:38,670
Croaky alternate universe.

2048
01:18:40,310 --> 01:18:41,150
I suppose.

2049
01:18:41,570 --> 01:18:42,710
Oh, I suppose so.

2050
01:18:43,550 --> 01:18:45,850
We like recipes they give us.

2051
01:18:45,950 --> 01:18:46,210
Yay!

2052
01:18:46,890 --> 01:18:47,510
Ribbit.

2053
01:18:47,650 --> 01:18:54,570
After many long years of struggle and solitude, I finally met Nutter Soul, who shares my hobbies.

2054
01:18:55,150 --> 01:18:55,370
Hmm.

2055
01:18:56,970 --> 01:18:59,970
Oh, you're way too young for that to be true.

2056
01:19:00,610 --> 01:19:05,110
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge frog statue fan.

2057
01:19:06,130 --> 01:19:09,310
Oh, well, the fanatic part of your name says it all.

2058
01:19:09,470 --> 01:19:09,750
Whoa!

2059
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:11,330
Ribbit?

2060
01:19:11,490 --> 01:19:13,210
How did you know my name?

2061
01:19:13,390 --> 01:19:13,870
Oh, no.

2062
01:19:14,490 --> 01:19:16,810
Yeah, short-term memory loss.

2063
01:19:17,050 --> 01:19:17,250
I love him.

2064
01:19:18,470 --> 01:19:20,730
You mentioned it like 10 seconds ago.

2065
01:19:21,230 --> 01:19:21,510
Oh.

2066
01:19:22,490 --> 01:19:25,430
So, how can I not like them?

2067
01:19:25,650 --> 01:19:27,390
Those bulging eyes.

2068
01:19:27,790 --> 01:19:30,430
The cold, damp feel as you run your...

2069
01:19:30,430 --> 01:19:30,790
Okay.

2070
01:19:31,090 --> 01:19:31,370
Okay.

2071
01:19:31,490 --> 01:19:32,010
That's...

2072
01:19:32,010 --> 01:19:33,070
Okay, croaky.

2073
01:19:33,430 --> 01:19:34,030
That's...

2074
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:39,010
Everything about them fascinates me.

2075
01:19:39,970 --> 01:19:41,850
Uh, you okay?

2076
01:19:42,910 --> 01:19:46,330
By the way, I have a favorite to ask from...

2077
01:19:46,330 --> 01:19:47,290
Guys, I don't know this...

2078
01:19:47,290 --> 01:19:48,450
I don't know this kid, guys.

2079
01:19:48,710 --> 01:19:49,130
I...

2080
01:19:49,130 --> 01:19:51,890
Do not associate me with this child.

2081
01:19:52,290 --> 01:19:52,990
What is it?

2082
01:19:53,450 --> 01:19:55,170
And that would be...

2083
01:19:55,170 --> 01:19:56,270
Oh...

2084
01:19:56,270 --> 01:20:04,050
As a true statue fanatic, My duty is naturally to learn about every frog statue in Azuma.

2085
01:20:04,530 --> 01:20:05,210
Hmm...

2086
01:20:05,210 --> 01:20:06,810
I can't do that all myself.

2087
01:20:07,210 --> 01:20:09,670
No matter how much I wish I could.

2088
01:20:11,270 --> 01:20:14,410
I'm bound by the pain of my existence.

2089
01:20:15,730 --> 01:20:16,510
Curve...

2090
01:20:16,510 --> 01:20:17,630
He has parents?

2091
01:20:18,290 --> 01:20:19,530
Ha ha ha ha ha!

2092
01:20:20,290 --> 01:20:20,930
Okay.

2093
01:20:21,890 --> 01:20:22,210
Hmm...

2094
01:20:22,530 --> 01:20:22,690
I...

2095
01:20:22,690 --> 01:20:25,450
Honestly, I just assumed he was an orphan at that point.

2096
01:20:25,930 --> 01:20:26,250
I...

2097
01:20:26,250 --> 01:20:27,350
I mean...

2098
01:20:27,350 --> 01:20:28,730
You're still a kid.

2099
01:20:28,970 --> 01:20:29,350
Ha ha ha ha!

2100
01:20:29,830 --> 01:20:30,990
My parents don't...

2101
01:20:30,990 --> 01:20:32,290
Do your parents know your...

2102
01:20:32,290 --> 01:20:32,750
You...

2103
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:34,150
About your frog obsession?

2104
01:20:35,150 --> 01:20:36,870
Ha ha ha!

2105
01:20:36,870 --> 01:20:38,950
Say, it's way too dangerous.

2106
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:41,110
So I sneak out instead.

2107
01:20:41,590 --> 01:20:42,430
We can't have that.

2108
01:20:42,690 --> 01:20:43,770
Oh, please don't.

2109
01:20:43,870 --> 01:20:45,010
Your parents have a point.

2110
01:20:45,190 --> 01:20:45,290
Yeah.

2111
01:20:45,810 --> 01:20:46,850
I know, I know.

2112
01:20:47,070 --> 01:20:49,090
I'll go straight home after this.

2113
01:20:49,210 --> 01:20:49,310
Hey!

2114
01:20:50,450 --> 01:20:53,010
What, can you let me know if I find any more frog statues?

2115
01:20:53,490 --> 01:20:53,850
Ha ha ha!

2116
01:20:54,030 --> 01:20:57,690
Tell me about their location and shape and size, feel, smell, taste, every...

2117
01:20:57,690 --> 01:20:58,750
Okay, okay!

2118
01:20:59,090 --> 01:21:01,210
I'm gonna be talking to your parents later.

2119
01:21:01,570 --> 01:21:02,270
Ha ha ha ha!

2120
01:21:03,150 --> 01:21:05,050
Wait, what was that last one?

2121
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:05,770
Well...

2122
01:21:05,770 --> 01:21:07,770
Please, I'm begging you!

2123
01:21:07,930 --> 01:21:08,290
Understood.

2124
01:21:08,970 --> 01:21:09,650
Sure, okay.

2125
01:21:09,810 --> 01:21:11,510
I should not enable this child.

2126
01:21:12,230 --> 01:21:14,750
Ribbit, I knew I could count on you.

2127
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:17,690
You can usually find me in Spring Village.

2128
01:21:17,950 --> 01:21:20,330
Let me know when you ever find a frog statue.

2129
01:21:21,350 --> 01:21:21,870
Oh...

2130
01:21:21,870 --> 01:21:24,810
Find it up and I'll give you some treasure I discovered.

2131
01:21:25,210 --> 01:21:25,330
Huh?

2132
01:21:26,050 --> 01:21:28,570
We should really talk to his parents, guys.

2133
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:29,710
Ha ha ha ha!

2134
01:21:30,610 --> 01:21:31,130
Really?

2135
01:21:31,330 --> 01:21:31,450
Yeah.

2136
01:21:32,130 --> 01:21:32,650
Really?

2137
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:35,030
Only makes sense to reward you for your work.

2138
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:35,470
Ha ha ha!

2139
01:21:35,770 --> 01:21:39,330
After all, more frog statue means more happiness!

2140
01:21:39,910 --> 01:21:40,790
Ha ha ha ha ha!

2141
01:21:43,070 --> 01:21:43,490
Okay...

2142
01:21:43,490 --> 01:21:44,350
You can do it!

2143
01:21:44,490 --> 01:21:44,910
Great!

2144
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:46,090
Thanks a bunch!

2145
01:21:46,830 --> 01:21:47,230
Alright.

2146
01:21:47,910 --> 01:21:50,230
Perform it before one of many mysterious frog statues.

2147
01:21:50,510 --> 01:21:52,790
And the god residing with it will give you a recipe.

2148
01:21:53,270 --> 01:21:53,570
Yay!

2149
01:21:54,850 --> 01:21:56,130
I'll be able to cook more.

2150
01:21:56,310 --> 01:21:57,050
Wait, what's up in here?

2151
01:21:57,110 --> 01:21:58,390
Wait, is that another frog statue?

2152
01:21:59,190 --> 01:21:59,710
What's that?

2153
01:21:59,750 --> 01:22:00,470
Oh no, it's an ore.

2154
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:02,170
Okay, we gotta do this.

2155
01:22:03,550 --> 01:22:04,070
Alright.

2156
01:22:05,050 --> 01:22:05,570
Nice.

2157
01:22:07,170 --> 01:22:08,070
Guys, don't...

2158
01:22:08,070 --> 01:22:08,510
Oh, shit!

2159
01:22:09,030 --> 01:22:09,850
Ha ha ha ha!

2160
01:22:10,070 --> 01:22:10,230
Sorry!

2161
01:22:10,650 --> 01:22:10,970
Don't...

2162
01:22:10,970 --> 01:22:12,130
Don't lick ran...

2163
01:22:12,130 --> 01:22:12,770
Oh, hi there!

2164
01:22:13,170 --> 01:22:13,690
Friendly?

2165
01:22:15,390 --> 01:22:15,910
Oh!

2166
01:22:16,070 --> 01:22:16,690
Not friendly!

2167
01:22:18,010 --> 01:22:19,150
Oh my god.

2168
01:22:19,550 --> 01:22:20,610
The chicken doodle.

2169
01:22:21,090 --> 01:22:21,870
A pleca doodle.

2170
01:22:22,950 --> 01:22:23,530
Guys...

2171
01:22:23,530 --> 01:22:24,890
It was not friendly.

2172
01:22:26,290 --> 01:22:26,870
No!

2173
01:22:27,090 --> 01:22:28,450
I accidentally used my drop!

2174
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:29,350
Wait, I can still...

2175
01:22:29,350 --> 01:22:29,510
Okay.

2176
01:22:30,330 --> 01:22:32,590
Your dance has brought me joy and happiness.

2177
01:22:33,150 --> 01:22:36,070
Granted, allow me to bestow upon you this recipe!

2178
01:22:36,530 --> 01:22:38,210
Oh, I can make Tamago!

2179
01:22:38,650 --> 01:22:38,990
Nice!

2180
01:22:39,290 --> 01:22:39,770
Oh, there's...

2181
01:22:39,770 --> 01:22:40,190
Oh my gosh.

2182
01:22:40,250 --> 01:22:41,870
I actually swear I really want Tamago right now.

2183
01:22:42,490 --> 01:22:44,690
Oh, sweet rolled eggs recipe.

2184
01:22:45,390 --> 01:22:45,990
Ahhhh!

2185
01:22:46,450 --> 01:22:47,610
Hello, Tamago!

2186
01:22:49,690 --> 01:22:50,290
Hello!

2187
01:22:50,710 --> 01:22:51,150
I'm...

2188
01:22:51,150 --> 01:22:52,570
Oh, I'm craving it right now.

2189
01:22:53,230 --> 01:22:53,890
Oh, I should dance.

2190
01:22:54,150 --> 01:22:54,630
Dance!

2191
01:22:55,370 --> 01:22:55,730
Yay!

2192
01:22:56,610 --> 01:22:57,510
Alright, that's not...

2193
01:22:57,510 --> 01:22:58,310
I'm tired now.

2194
01:22:58,550 --> 01:22:59,490
No more dancing.

2195
01:23:01,510 --> 01:23:02,710
Okay, let's...

2196
01:23:03,430 --> 01:23:04,290
Alright, let's...

2197
01:23:04,790 --> 01:23:06,950
Let's get them out of the way first for free XP.

2198
01:23:07,830 --> 01:23:09,990
I like myself some free XP.

2199
01:23:11,550 --> 01:23:12,670
Oh, more ores!

2200
01:23:16,710 --> 01:23:17,310
Come on.

2201
01:23:17,610 --> 01:23:18,590
Oh, I can hold it.

2202
01:23:18,650 --> 01:23:18,870
Whoops.

2203
01:23:20,190 --> 01:23:20,730
I keep...

2204
01:23:20,730 --> 01:23:22,350
I skipped the instructions there.

2205
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:22,750
Oh, look!

2206
01:23:22,850 --> 01:23:23,230
A chest!

2207
01:23:24,210 --> 01:23:24,650
Yoink!

2208
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:26,070
Yay!

2209
01:23:26,430 --> 01:23:26,970
My soil!

2210
01:23:27,530 --> 01:23:28,990
So, what's your verdict?

2211
01:23:29,210 --> 01:23:29,810
Good or bad?

2212
01:23:30,550 --> 01:23:31,010
Alright.

2213
01:23:31,430 --> 01:23:32,870
Let's actually do our mission.

2214
01:23:33,070 --> 01:23:33,330
What's your...

2215
01:23:35,090 --> 01:23:36,210
Oh, fast travel!

2216
01:23:36,450 --> 01:23:37,010
Okay, nice.

2217
01:23:37,890 --> 01:23:39,350
So, there's fast travel here.

2218
01:23:41,610 --> 01:23:42,310
Don't worry.

2219
01:23:42,510 --> 01:23:44,050
I shall dance for the gods.

2220
01:23:44,390 --> 01:23:45,150
I do nothing.

2221
01:23:46,030 --> 01:23:46,350
Alright.

2222
01:23:46,830 --> 01:23:49,830
Let's save this real quick before we go into our next mission.

2223
01:23:50,230 --> 01:23:51,410
Our next cutscene.

2224
01:23:53,690 --> 01:23:54,890
That's a good question.

2225
01:23:55,170 --> 01:23:56,130
I think, like...

2226
01:23:56,130 --> 01:23:58,250
Because I'm still in the tutorial...

2227
01:23:58,250 --> 01:23:58,950
It doesn't...

2228
01:23:58,950 --> 01:23:59,950
I don't have the...

2229
01:23:59,950 --> 01:24:02,530
The in-game time hasn't passed yet.

2230
01:24:02,770 --> 01:24:03,550
I think that's why.

2231
01:24:09,850 --> 01:24:13,130
I think that's why it hasn't passed.

2232
01:24:20,570 --> 01:24:21,130
Yeah.

2233
01:24:22,570 --> 01:24:24,170
This dragon's not scared.

2234
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:30,050
Oh, whoa, whoa, Woobly.

2235
01:24:30,350 --> 01:24:31,390
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2236
01:24:31,450 --> 01:24:32,450
Stop projecting.

2237
01:24:34,150 --> 01:24:34,750
Hello?

2238
01:24:35,190 --> 01:24:35,990
Who's that?

2239
01:24:38,190 --> 01:24:39,450
He seems friendly.

2240
01:24:41,310 --> 01:24:42,930
He seems really friendly.

2241
01:24:44,850 --> 01:24:46,390
Okay, I can hold...

2242
01:24:46,390 --> 01:24:48,770
I was, like, clicking when I was mining.

2243
01:24:49,910 --> 01:24:50,250
Okay.

2244
01:24:50,370 --> 01:24:50,850
Oh, wait.

2245
01:24:50,930 --> 01:24:51,450
That's armor.

2246
01:24:51,610 --> 01:24:52,310
I'm pretty sure.

2247
01:24:54,550 --> 01:24:57,510
Yeah, I want to put armor on.

2248
01:24:58,330 --> 01:24:58,690
Yay!

2249
01:24:59,950 --> 01:25:00,950
Yeah, just...

2250
01:25:01,510 --> 01:25:01,810
What?

2251
01:25:01,810 --> 01:25:03,890
Wow, he can loiter if he wants.

2252
01:25:04,750 --> 01:25:06,370
This is a free village.

2253
01:25:07,530 --> 01:25:08,290
Alright, Pentrowazi.

2254
01:25:08,290 --> 01:25:09,530
Don't disappear until you...

2255
01:25:09,530 --> 01:25:10,390
Okay, that's easy.

2256
01:25:11,130 --> 01:25:12,170
I have lots of practice.

2257
01:25:14,330 --> 01:25:14,890
Okay.

2258
01:25:15,130 --> 01:25:15,730
That's right.

2259
01:25:16,330 --> 01:25:17,490
What you gonna do?

2260
01:25:17,590 --> 01:25:18,090
Hit me?

2261
01:25:18,650 --> 01:25:19,450
That's right.

2262
01:25:19,690 --> 01:25:20,770
You can't hit me.

2263
01:25:20,970 --> 01:25:22,030
I'm level three.

2264
01:25:23,890 --> 01:25:24,510
Nice.

2265
01:25:25,170 --> 01:25:25,890
Look at that.

2266
01:25:26,210 --> 01:25:27,470
I didn't get hit once.

2267
01:25:27,710 --> 01:25:28,030
Guys.

2268
01:25:31,310 --> 01:25:31,930
Alright.

2269
01:25:32,130 --> 01:25:33,330
Oh, I got an energy potion.

2270
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:37,970
If I keep mashing, I'll never die.

2271
01:25:39,070 --> 01:25:40,190
I got miso soup.

2272
01:25:40,690 --> 01:25:40,930
Ooh.

2273
01:25:44,990 --> 01:25:45,470
Hello?

2274
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:48,550
I mean, all I have to do is left click.

2275
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:48,830
Yeah.

2276
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:52,770
Sacred treasures aren't the only thing that gives you perks for mastering them.

2277
01:25:53,330 --> 01:25:56,290
Go to the short sword skill tree and unlock charge attack.

2278
01:25:56,810 --> 01:25:59,850
Battles should be a breeze if you keep unlocking more skills to choose from.

2279
01:26:00,110 --> 01:26:00,590
Wait.

2280
01:26:00,750 --> 01:26:01,850
I can even unlock...

2281
01:26:01,850 --> 01:26:02,110
Ooh.

2282
01:26:02,630 --> 01:26:04,370
Oh, I can have different attacks, too.

2283
01:26:04,770 --> 01:26:05,610
I like that.

2284
01:26:06,310 --> 01:26:06,790
Okay.

2285
01:26:07,250 --> 01:26:07,710
Yes.

2286
01:26:08,190 --> 01:26:08,970
How loud XP.

2287
01:26:12,090 --> 01:26:13,270
Hold and release.

2288
01:26:13,630 --> 01:26:13,850
Ooh.

2289
01:26:14,130 --> 01:26:14,770
More damage.

2290
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:15,450
No.

2291
01:26:15,550 --> 01:26:17,550
We don't need defense if we just do damage.

2292
01:26:19,270 --> 01:26:20,770
We should be in a better shape now.

2293
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:23,370
Did you know that drum dance can also help you in battle?

2294
01:26:23,630 --> 01:26:23,850
Yeah.

2295
01:26:24,070 --> 01:26:24,890
But it costs RP.

2296
01:26:25,610 --> 01:26:27,290
I want to save that for dancing.

2297
01:26:28,310 --> 01:26:30,110
I'm a dancer, not a fighter.

2298
01:26:31,670 --> 01:26:34,370
Well, restore HP to you and any nearby allies.

2299
01:26:35,670 --> 01:26:36,150
Drum...

2300
01:26:37,530 --> 01:26:40,010
The most difficult combo of all time.

2301
01:26:42,150 --> 01:26:42,610
Okay.

2302
01:26:43,890 --> 01:26:44,390
Doink.

2303
01:26:44,970 --> 01:26:45,830
More rock.

2304
01:26:48,430 --> 01:26:48,990
Yay.

2305
01:26:51,150 --> 01:26:52,550
And then more...

2306
01:26:52,550 --> 01:26:53,110
Oh, vinegar.

2307
01:26:53,550 --> 01:26:54,090
I like that.

2308
01:26:56,130 --> 01:26:57,030
Oh, wait.

2309
01:26:57,070 --> 01:26:57,790
Is that one hit?

2310
01:26:58,010 --> 01:26:58,310
Wait.

2311
01:26:58,370 --> 01:26:59,210
That's so strong.

2312
01:27:00,090 --> 01:27:00,650
Yes.

2313
01:27:00,710 --> 01:27:01,930
More vinegar for my salad.

2314
01:27:02,390 --> 01:27:02,650
Wait.

2315
01:27:02,650 --> 01:27:03,290
That's insane.

2316
01:27:04,950 --> 01:27:07,650
I assume that that's like a perfect attack, too.

2317
01:27:08,330 --> 01:27:09,770
When it glows.

2318
01:27:10,030 --> 01:27:11,270
That's like a crit or something.

2319
01:27:12,030 --> 01:27:12,230
Yay.

2320
01:27:12,370 --> 01:27:13,010
Level four.

2321
01:27:14,090 --> 01:27:15,750
More vinegar for my...

2322
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:16,550
Oh, soy sauce.

2323
01:27:16,670 --> 01:27:16,930
Nice.

2324
01:27:18,310 --> 01:27:20,230
I need soy sauce for my sushi.

2325
01:27:20,570 --> 01:27:21,070
Come on.

2326
01:27:21,530 --> 01:27:24,370
For my sushi that you're always going to make me.

2327
01:27:24,670 --> 01:27:25,390
The tea house.

2328
01:27:27,130 --> 01:27:27,790
Oh, nice.

2329
01:27:28,070 --> 01:27:28,390
Yoink.

2330
01:27:29,450 --> 01:27:30,810
My offering now.

2331
01:27:32,570 --> 01:27:33,570
Earth dancer.

2332
01:27:34,310 --> 01:27:36,550
Your dance has brought me joy and happiness.

2333
01:27:36,550 --> 01:27:38,810
I got a grilled onigiri.

2334
01:27:39,950 --> 01:27:40,390
Nice.

2335
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:42,170
For my onigiri that I found.

2336
01:27:44,530 --> 01:27:45,410
Oh, shit.

2337
01:27:45,630 --> 01:27:45,770
Wait.

2338
01:27:45,810 --> 01:27:46,850
Where did that chicken come from?

2339
01:27:49,130 --> 01:27:50,610
Why is there a chicken here?

2340
01:27:51,690 --> 01:27:52,130
Okay.

2341
01:27:52,210 --> 01:27:52,450
Nice.

2342
01:27:53,950 --> 01:27:55,070
He's just like, hey, guys.

2343
01:27:55,390 --> 01:27:56,210
Where's my friends?

2344
01:27:56,610 --> 01:27:57,310
Bye, chicken.

2345
01:27:58,510 --> 01:27:58,950
Okay.

2346
01:27:58,970 --> 01:27:59,910
I like the charge attack.

2347
01:28:00,610 --> 01:28:01,610
Oh, I can harvest the trees?

2348
01:28:01,730 --> 01:28:01,990
Oh, yeah.

2349
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:03,210
Because they're like grown trees.

2350
01:28:07,690 --> 01:28:08,710
No, I shouldn't.

2351
01:28:09,810 --> 01:28:10,650
You know what?

2352
01:28:10,990 --> 01:28:11,970
She's not here.

2353
01:28:12,810 --> 01:28:13,970
Guys, she's not here.

2354
01:28:14,090 --> 01:28:14,990
I can chop this tree.

2355
01:28:17,150 --> 01:28:17,670
Oh.

2356
01:28:18,010 --> 01:28:19,010
Oh, it stays.

2357
01:28:19,670 --> 01:28:19,790
Oh.

2358
01:28:20,870 --> 01:28:22,790
I thought it actually cuts down.

2359
01:28:23,550 --> 01:28:25,110
Oh, the tree actually stays.

2360
01:28:25,470 --> 01:28:25,670
Okay.

2361
01:28:26,210 --> 01:28:27,990
That's like less bad.

2362
01:28:30,750 --> 01:28:31,270
Nice.

2363
01:28:31,930 --> 01:28:33,070
Guys, I knew that.

2364
01:28:33,210 --> 01:28:34,450
Guys, I knew that.

2365
01:28:35,070 --> 01:28:36,810
I knew that it stayed, guys.

2366
01:28:36,950 --> 01:28:37,270
That's right.

2367
01:28:38,470 --> 01:28:38,770
Nice.

2368
01:28:40,350 --> 01:28:40,790
Okay.

2369
01:28:41,030 --> 01:28:42,450
I like that this attack one shot.

2370
01:28:43,590 --> 01:28:45,210
It makes it much more convenient.

2371
01:28:47,050 --> 01:28:48,190
Oh, there's a nice statue.

2372
01:28:48,290 --> 01:28:48,710
Oh, nice.

2373
01:28:49,770 --> 01:28:51,750
I don't see no villager here.

2374
01:28:52,910 --> 01:28:53,890
Is it for free?

2375
01:28:54,650 --> 01:28:57,010
May these fresh fruits and vegetables grow ripe.

2376
01:28:57,130 --> 01:28:57,810
And one day.

2377
01:28:58,110 --> 01:28:58,670
And bring someone.

2378
01:28:58,790 --> 01:28:58,970
See?

2379
01:28:59,130 --> 01:28:59,990
It's like a communal.

2380
01:29:00,470 --> 01:29:01,890
No, I'm not a thief.

2381
01:29:01,890 --> 01:29:02,810
It's a communal.

2382
01:29:03,650 --> 01:29:05,170
It's a communal farm.

2383
01:29:05,490 --> 01:29:06,030
Look at that.

2384
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:12,460
It's not my cabbages.

2385
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:15,620
It's a community farm.

2386
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:17,480
And I'm part of the community.

2387
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:20,400
Dance.

2388
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:22,120
I get...

2389
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:24,460
Oh, a stone sculpture recipe.

2390
01:29:24,980 --> 01:29:26,340
More offerings for me.

2391
01:29:27,260 --> 01:29:29,100
I can use it for more offerings.

2392
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:33,340
You'll think it's for a god.

2393
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:34,500
But it's actually for me.

2394
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:36,540
I also sense a human presence.

2395
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:37,360
A human?

2396
01:29:37,620 --> 01:29:38,080
What's a human?

2397
01:29:38,180 --> 01:29:39,100
Oh, the carpenter.

2398
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:40,180
I almost forgot about him.

2399
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:42,120
I was gonna say, what is he doing here?

2400
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:48,600
I forgot my main mission.

2401
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:52,200
To find the carpenter.

2402
01:29:55,660 --> 01:29:56,380
Alright.

2403
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:57,480
Is that miso?

2404
01:29:58,460 --> 01:29:59,240
What's this?

2405
01:29:59,360 --> 01:29:59,920
Oh, cheese.

2406
01:30:00,540 --> 01:30:00,980
Nice.

2407
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:03,080
That's right.

2408
01:30:04,220 --> 01:30:05,040
Oh, a grill.

2409
01:30:05,780 --> 01:30:07,480
Do I need to eat anything, though?

2410
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:13,300
Oh, the onigiri that I found at the shrine.

2411
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:16,100
It was just sitting there for some reason.

2412
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:19,380
My jar cheese.

2413
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:20,560
Yay!

2414
01:30:24,620 --> 01:30:25,440
Dance here.

2415
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,200
I mean, you were working for food for six months.

2416
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:29,520
So, it makes sense.

2417
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:31,240
Nepers, thank you for the super chat.

2418
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:31,600
Thank you.

2419
01:30:31,780 --> 01:30:32,260
Thank you.

2420
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:34,360
Alright.

2421
01:30:36,780 --> 01:30:37,800
No, no, no.

2422
01:30:37,940 --> 01:30:38,960
I didn't steal it.

2423
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:40,340
It was just lying there.

2424
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:41,660
In the open.

2425
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:44,660
You know, like, the five second rule?

2426
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:47,240
It's already past five seconds, so it's mine now.

2427
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:49,760
That's what it actually means.

2428
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:50,620
Oh, nice.

2429
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:51,820
That gives me my RP back.

2430
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:53,100
I need that.

2431
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:54,080
I had, like, no energy.

2432
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:55,960
Oh, it's limited, though.

2433
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:57,640
It doesn't fully heal it.

2434
01:30:59,380 --> 01:31:00,300
It's like...

2435
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:02,840
It's like ocean law, but on land.

2436
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:03,920
Land law!

2437
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:08,200
You've got company!

2438
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:09,620
Stay back!

2439
01:31:11,780 --> 01:31:12,780
Is he friendly?

2440
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:16,040
Oh my god, do you see those abs?

2441
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:20,720
Bosses of high defense will make it difficult to damage them through normal means.

2442
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:23,440
So, one strategy is to fill up their sun gauge.

2443
01:31:23,740 --> 01:31:26,640
When the gauge is full, you'll immobilize them and deal more damage.

2444
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,820
Each boss has a unique...

2445
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:32,600
He's going through some things, okay, guys?

2446
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:34,420
That poor emo horse.

2447
01:31:34,940 --> 01:31:39,320
Attacking them with their elemental arenas or striking their weak point will fill the gauge faster.

2448
01:31:39,580 --> 01:31:39,900
Okay.

2449
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:40,620
Don't worry.

2450
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:41,880
Drum tap.

2451
01:31:43,980 --> 01:31:49,560
I don't think he liked my drum.

2452
01:31:52,100 --> 01:31:52,740
Nice.

2453
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:53,380
Oh.

2454
01:31:56,820 --> 01:31:57,780
Hey, nice.

2455
01:31:57,940 --> 01:31:58,400
I stun him.

2456
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:01,120
Okay.

2457
01:32:01,340 --> 01:32:01,660
Nice.

2458
01:32:05,940 --> 01:32:06,580
No!

2459
01:32:08,060 --> 01:32:08,900
That's fine.

2460
01:32:09,980 --> 01:32:11,380
I stunned him again.

2461
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:15,860
I'm just gonna use the... I'm just gonna use the crit here.

2462
01:32:16,060 --> 01:32:17,220
It's actually faster.

2463
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:20,500
Oh my gosh, look, I dodged!

2464
01:32:22,580 --> 01:32:23,960
Oh my god.

2465
01:32:24,420 --> 01:32:25,540
Look at that.

2466
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:28,100
Finally, I know how to dodge.

2467
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:29,340
I learned.

2468
01:32:29,540 --> 01:32:31,560
I learned from my waifu.

2469
01:32:37,740 --> 01:32:38,340
Oh!

2470
01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:41,480
He heard no bell.

2471
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:45,240
There was no bell.

2472
01:32:48,830 --> 01:32:49,430
Who's that?

2473
01:32:51,470 --> 01:32:52,250
Hey, see?

2474
01:32:52,290 --> 01:32:53,470
I told you he was a nice person.

2475
01:32:55,050 --> 01:32:55,950
Cyclone Blade?

2476
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:05,280
Let me solo him.

2477
01:33:07,860 --> 01:33:09,420
I took him out in one hit.

2478
01:33:11,860 --> 01:33:13,720
Oh, that's so... Wait, what level are you?

2479
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:16,140
Oh, that's the carpenter!

2480
01:33:17,140 --> 01:33:18,660
Is that Takumi the carpenter?

2481
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:20,420
How did he become a monster?

2482
01:33:20,460 --> 01:33:22,180
Oh, wait, he became a monster?

2483
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:23,580
Blame the blight.

2484
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:25,700
I've seen it happen many a time.

2485
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:30,200
When runes dry up, people fall more easily.

2486
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:32,300
Oh, he was, like, possessed by the demons!

2487
01:33:33,740 --> 01:33:34,020
Um...

2488
01:33:34,300 --> 01:33:35,680
Thank you for helping us.

2489
01:33:36,540 --> 01:33:37,800
No thanks needed.

2490
01:33:38,420 --> 01:33:39,380
You've already done most of the work.

2491
01:33:39,380 --> 01:33:40,580
Why are you hiding your face?

2492
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:43,380
Are you ashamed of yourself?

2493
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:44,800
However...

2494
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:46,040
That is not...

2495
01:33:46,620 --> 01:33:47,600
...convenient at all.

2496
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:02,700
Oh, so he's, like, a sword master.

2497
01:34:06,460 --> 01:34:08,080
Swordsman seeking greatness.

2498
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:10,880
The greatest swordsman of all time.

2499
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:13,580
I have many questions for you.

2500
01:34:13,860 --> 01:34:16,820
But first, you must take this man to safety.

2501
01:34:16,820 --> 01:34:18,920
Okay, we'll take him back to our village.

2502
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:20,200
He works for us.

2503
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:23,900
Oh my god, his hair...

2504
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:24,960
Whoa, who's that?

2505
01:34:26,700 --> 01:34:27,300
Dubli?

2506
01:34:33,020 --> 01:34:35,140
Okay, it's just...

2507
01:34:35,140 --> 01:34:37,720
I love the swimsuit costume.

2508
01:34:42,360 --> 01:34:42,960
Little?

2509
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:48,120
Yeah.

2510
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:50,760
It was all me, though, guys.

2511
01:34:51,060 --> 01:34:52,040
You, like...

2512
01:34:52,040 --> 01:34:53,620
I guess he did some stuff.

2513
01:34:53,740 --> 01:34:54,660
Like, he hit him once.

2514
01:34:56,160 --> 01:34:58,100
I'll repay you a hundredfold.

2515
01:34:58,340 --> 01:34:59,280
Say the word.

2516
01:34:59,980 --> 01:35:01,120
Will he do stuff for free?

2517
01:35:01,420 --> 01:35:02,060
Oh, yeah.

2518
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:02,980
Gladly.

2519
01:35:04,360 --> 01:35:04,540
Huh?

2520
01:35:04,860 --> 01:35:06,240
Who's this fuzzball?

2521
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:08,200
That's Woobly.

2522
01:35:08,300 --> 01:35:10,460
I am not a fuzzball.

2523
01:35:10,700 --> 01:35:14,280
For your information, I am a divine descendant.

2524
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:21,960
Dearest Takumi, it's an honor to make your acquaintance.

2525
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:25,160
I am the joyful elegance of spring.

2526
01:35:26,020 --> 01:35:28,360
Please, call me Ulalaka.

2527
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:30,200
Ulalaka?

2528
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:32,020
Well, aren't you a lovely young lady?

2529
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:33,500
Hey, she's mine!

2530
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:35,700
Hey, back off!

2531
01:35:36,260 --> 01:35:38,380
Actually, I've dwelled in this village...

2532
01:35:38,380 --> 01:35:39,700
...of self-defense again.

2533
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:43,920
Come on, now.

2534
01:35:44,140 --> 01:35:47,260
I've lived here all my life, and I've never seen a girl half as pretty...

2535
01:35:47,260 --> 01:35:47,640
Hey!

2536
01:35:48,020 --> 01:35:48,900
Hey, I'm right...

2537
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:49,600
Hey, hey!

2538
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:50,840
I'm right here.

2539
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:52,080
My, my.

2540
01:35:52,460 --> 01:35:53,420
You flatter me.

2541
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:55,260
Stay away from her!

2542
01:35:55,420 --> 01:35:55,760
Whatever.

2543
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:00,860
It's pretty?

2544
01:36:01,060 --> 01:36:01,540
Whoa!

2545
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:02,660
Whoa!

2546
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:04,500
Let me fill you in.

2547
01:36:04,860 --> 01:36:06,360
Oh, Sybil, thank you for the rain.

2548
01:36:06,540 --> 01:36:07,420
Thank you, thank you.

2549
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:10,920
I can't believe it.

2550
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:12,800
Wait, I'm the village chief.

2551
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:14,180
I can kick him out of the village.

2552
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:18,760
How long was he gone?

2553
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:19,880
How...

2554
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:23,040
How long was he gone?

2555
01:36:24,620 --> 01:36:25,800
What's up, Fluffy?

2556
01:36:26,860 --> 01:36:29,140
You meant what you said earlier, right?

2557
01:36:29,620 --> 01:36:31,880
I'm gonna raise his taxes.

2558
01:36:32,380 --> 01:36:32,940
What did I say?

2559
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:35,680
That you'd repay us?

2560
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:36,360
Yeah!

2561
01:36:37,180 --> 01:36:38,040
Leave the village!

2562
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:39,460
Oh, yeah!

2563
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:40,440
You bet.

2564
01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:42,280
Only fair for saving my life.

2565
01:36:42,580 --> 01:36:44,580
You just say the word, and I'll come running.

2566
01:36:45,420 --> 01:36:46,800
That better apply to me, too.

2567
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:49,540
Saving you was a team effort, okay?

2568
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:51,040
Woobly, you just stood there.

2569
01:36:51,540 --> 01:36:52,320
That's so.

2570
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:56,720
Can't you humor me a little?

2571
01:36:57,220 --> 01:36:57,580
No.

2572
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:02,180
My partner and I are gonna need your help later.

2573
01:37:02,580 --> 01:37:04,480
So don't forget you owe us.

2574
01:37:07,260 --> 01:37:07,800
All right.

2575
01:37:08,060 --> 01:37:09,120
What is he gonna do for me?

2576
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:11,320
Would you come with me a moment?

2577
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:11,700
What?

2578
01:37:11,980 --> 01:37:13,360
I'd like to give you something.

2579
01:37:14,260 --> 01:37:15,160
What is it?

2580
01:37:16,140 --> 01:37:16,840
Take this.

2581
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:19,160
Consider it a...

2582
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:20,300
I love freestyle.

2583
01:37:21,180 --> 01:37:21,980
Isn't this...

2584
01:37:21,980 --> 01:37:22,620
What is it?

2585
01:37:23,940 --> 01:37:24,940
It was my...

2586
01:37:24,940 --> 01:37:25,200
Oh, yeah.

2587
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:25,980
Fix my roof.

2588
01:37:26,180 --> 01:37:26,300
Yeah.

2589
01:37:26,660 --> 01:37:27,200
I was gonna say.

2590
01:37:27,580 --> 01:37:27,940
Wait.

2591
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,020
I need him to fix my roof.

2592
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:30,680
I'm sure you'll make better use of it now.

2593
01:37:32,020 --> 01:37:32,800
Trusty partner?

2594
01:37:33,100 --> 01:37:33,980
Is it a sword?

2595
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:35,180
It's the bow!

2596
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:35,740
Yes!

2597
01:37:36,460 --> 01:37:37,160
There you go!

2598
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:38,920
Apparently the bow is the newest...

2599
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:40,480
One of the newest weapons for the...

2600
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:41,400
Rune factory.

2601
01:37:41,620 --> 01:37:42,200
In Rune factory.

2602
01:37:42,860 --> 01:37:42,960
Oh.

2603
01:37:44,260 --> 01:37:44,620
Wait.

2604
01:37:44,860 --> 01:37:45,700
Practice bow?

2605
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:48,700
That'll make for a good secondary.

2606
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:49,520
Gun get.

2607
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:50,280
Yeah.

2608
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:51,700
A secondary weapon.

2609
01:37:51,900 --> 01:37:53,460
One you can switch up to on the fly.

2610
01:37:53,780 --> 01:37:56,560
Let's say you're wielding a sword when you suddenly feel like using a bow instead.

2611
01:37:56,840 --> 01:37:57,780
It's kind of like that.

2612
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,000
I like how he's like...

2613
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,660
This has been my trusty partner.

2614
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:02,440
For years and years.

2615
01:38:02,620 --> 01:38:03,860
And it's like a practice bow.

2616
01:38:07,340 --> 01:38:07,900
Oh.

2617
01:38:08,260 --> 01:38:08,500
Okay.

2618
01:38:08,840 --> 01:38:09,480
All right.

2619
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:10,740
Try it out yourself.

2620
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:11,620
And you'll see.

2621
01:38:12,540 --> 01:38:13,200
All right.

2622
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:14,980
Let's equip our practice bow.

2623
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:16,720
Look.

2624
01:38:16,980 --> 01:38:17,720
There he says.

2625
01:38:18,100 --> 01:38:19,020
Practice bow.

2626
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:22,480
I'm a little concerned, old man.

2627
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:24,440
Okay.

2628
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:26,000
How do I use the practice bow?

2629
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:28,880
Uh.

2630
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:29,440
Uh.

2631
01:38:30,680 --> 01:38:31,860
You can also equip a...

2632
01:38:31,860 --> 01:38:32,580
Use Q to...

2633
01:38:32,580 --> 01:38:33,720
Oh, I can press Q.

2634
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:34,560
Bow's fire.

2635
01:38:34,680 --> 01:38:35,380
Steady stream of arrows.

2636
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:37,360
I can hit both distant and airborne enemies.

2637
01:38:38,620 --> 01:38:40,240
Use control to ready your bow.

2638
01:38:40,460 --> 01:38:41,320
And then...

2639
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:41,640
To aim.

2640
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:43,520
Then...

2641
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:44,080
Okay.

2642
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:44,940
Yeah, I can do that.

2643
01:38:45,080 --> 01:38:45,600
That's easy.

2644
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:52,300
I wonder how to do crit for a bow.

2645
01:38:53,660 --> 01:38:54,100
Impressive.

2646
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:56,560
I was right to put my faith in you.

2647
01:38:56,780 --> 01:38:58,080
I don't think it has dropped off.

2648
01:38:58,280 --> 01:38:59,460
Are you absolutely sure?

2649
01:39:00,620 --> 01:39:01,460
I think it's time.

2650
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:06,440
You see, this recent incident with Takumi has forced me to seriously consider retirement.

2651
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:08,720
Oh, I just read it faster than him.

2652
01:39:12,100 --> 01:39:16,040
I hate to ask for anything in return, but...

2653
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:19,220
I'd like you to check the request board every so often.

2654
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:24,640
The villagers will sometimes hang wooden emma plaques bearing their wishes.

2655
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:28,240
I'm sure they'd appreciate your aid.

2656
01:39:28,240 --> 01:39:28,540
Don't worry.

2657
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:29,260
I got you.

2658
01:39:29,460 --> 01:39:30,200
I'll be it.

2659
01:39:30,340 --> 01:39:33,860
I guess I'll consider it repayment for the bow.

2660
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:37,240
Oh, he thinks I'm funny, guys.

2661
01:39:37,700 --> 01:39:39,920
Guys, it's not rude if he thinks it's funny.

2662
01:39:40,760 --> 01:39:43,660
I'll leave this village in your capable hands.

2663
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:44,780
Yeah.

2664
01:39:45,620 --> 01:39:47,300
Go take a quick look at the request board.

2665
01:39:47,560 --> 01:39:50,840
It's your duty as both chief and earth dancer.

2666
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:51,060
Don't worry.

2667
01:39:51,220 --> 01:39:52,240
I got you, guys.

2668
01:39:52,460 --> 01:39:53,400
Guys, he laughed.

2669
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:54,300
I was...

2670
01:39:54,300 --> 01:39:55,020
I'm funny.

2671
01:39:55,640 --> 01:40:00,240
Villagers will write down wooden requests on the wooden emma plaques and hang them on the request board.

2672
01:40:00,420 --> 01:40:02,320
Make their wish come true and they will reward you.

2673
01:40:02,820 --> 01:40:05,240
Report back to the request board to finish shop.

2674
01:40:05,340 --> 01:40:06,600
Okay, so these are like my mini mission.

2675
01:40:06,780 --> 01:40:07,440
Where did he go?

2676
01:40:07,740 --> 01:40:08,600
Was he a ghost?

2677
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:11,520
The village feels empty.

2678
01:40:11,620 --> 01:40:12,100
Well, many...

2679
01:40:12,100 --> 01:40:13,580
Wait, that's your own request.

2680
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:17,200
Build a house in Spring Village.

2681
01:40:17,540 --> 01:40:18,940
Tune in request.

2682
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:20,140
Turn in request.

2683
01:40:20,260 --> 01:40:20,440
Okay.

2684
01:40:21,860 --> 01:40:25,800
So this run down has so few houses available.

2685
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:28,620
That's his own request.

2686
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:37,260
Okay, so I need to go to the carpenter and the carpenter will make this for me.

2687
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:38,640
Is that where he lives?

2688
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:39,800
Okay, that is where he lives.

2689
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:41,040
Oh, where's the clock?

2690
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:42,160
Where is it?

2691
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:43,280
Oh, I see it.

2692
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:44,100
It's 12 p.m.

2693
01:40:44,780 --> 01:40:45,220
Lunchtime.

2694
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:47,160
Okay, wait.

2695
01:40:47,700 --> 01:40:48,980
Okay, I should do this mission.

2696
01:40:49,300 --> 01:40:49,400
Gotcha.

2697
01:40:52,220 --> 01:40:54,460
That's what old Sakaki wants?

2698
01:40:54,820 --> 01:40:55,320
All right.

2699
01:40:55,320 --> 01:40:56,500
Who am I to say no?

2700
01:40:56,700 --> 01:40:57,580
Count me in.

2701
01:40:58,520 --> 01:40:59,840
Fiesta time, guys.

2702
01:41:00,680 --> 01:41:02,180
You're still injured though, right?

2703
01:41:03,340 --> 01:41:03,640
Bah.

2704
01:41:04,260 --> 01:41:06,760
Gotta put the muscles to work every now and then.

2705
01:41:07,020 --> 01:41:10,040
Or they'll forget everything I taught him.

2706
01:41:10,460 --> 01:41:12,820
The real problem is going to be getting materials.

2707
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:14,880
Think you can handle that for me?

2708
01:41:14,980 --> 01:41:15,760
Leave it to me.

2709
01:41:15,880 --> 01:41:16,280
Of course.

2710
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:17,080
Here.

2711
01:41:18,120 --> 01:41:19,620
Here's a blueprint for a house.

2712
01:41:19,720 --> 01:41:20,960
Or what we call a recipe.

2713
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:22,800
Can't build without one of these.

2714
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:26,120
Let me know when you've got all the materials we'll need.

2715
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:26,700
Okay.

2716
01:41:27,380 --> 01:41:28,500
Just a humble house.

2717
01:41:29,140 --> 01:41:30,940
We need lumber and stone.

2718
01:41:31,180 --> 01:41:33,100
Okay, I need to start cutting trees down.

2719
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:34,900
Buildings and decorations.

2720
01:41:35,240 --> 01:41:38,780
Finding recipes will further expand your construction options.

2721
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:42,840
Only villagers with the hobby woodworker skill can run a carpenter.

2722
01:41:43,880 --> 01:41:45,340
We just need one anyway.

2723
01:41:46,020 --> 01:41:48,080
But let's go roll what we need just in case.

2724
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,720
You can collect lumber from trees growing outside the village.

2725
01:41:52,260 --> 01:41:54,120
Wither lumber won't do us any good though.

2726
01:41:54,300 --> 01:41:57,000
You have to perform your drum dance to revive the tree first.

2727
01:41:57,860 --> 01:42:00,900
By the way, if you've got new samplings, you can plant them inside the village.

2728
01:42:01,640 --> 01:42:04,160
Once they're fully grown, you can gather lumber from them.

2729
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:05,540
Just like trees out in the wild.

2730
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:09,460
You can also mine material stone from ore deposits outside the village.

2731
01:42:10,160 --> 01:42:12,340
Trees and ore deposits replenish themselves.

2732
01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:14,400
So you can harvest them again the following day.

2733
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:16,680
So you can't gather all you need in one day?

2734
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:18,480
You can always come back the next.

2735
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:22,160
And if it's money lacking, then it's time to grow and ship some vegetables.

2736
01:42:22,900 --> 01:42:23,900
Okay, that's easy.

2737
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:26,720
Alright, so I revived a lot of trees back then.

2738
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:28,020
Yeah, like this.

2739
01:42:28,380 --> 01:42:28,840
Wait, no.

2740
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:30,940
Which one are the trees I revived?

2741
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:31,280
Oh, wait.

2742
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:32,480
Oh, it's on the mini-map.

2743
01:42:32,600 --> 01:42:33,100
I see it.

2744
01:42:33,820 --> 01:42:34,460
Okay, thank God.

2745
01:42:34,700 --> 01:42:35,740
There's a mini-map here.

2746
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:39,780
I don't remember a little bit of where some of these trees are.

2747
01:42:40,360 --> 01:42:41,680
I've danced so much, guys.

2748
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:42,500
You don't understand.

2749
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:44,520
Man, all I did was dance.

2750
01:42:45,380 --> 01:42:49,700
I've lost track to how many times I've danced in front of all these trees.

2751
01:42:50,740 --> 01:42:52,640
I've danced so many.

2752
01:42:54,280 --> 01:42:54,700
Okay.

2753
01:42:55,020 --> 01:42:55,700
Yeah, there's like...

2754
01:42:55,700 --> 01:42:57,200
On the mini-map, it shows you, too.

2755
01:42:59,140 --> 01:42:59,760
What's this?

2756
01:42:59,880 --> 01:43:00,960
Oh, there's a big tree here.

2757
01:43:02,360 --> 01:43:03,140
Okay, nice.

2758
01:43:03,540 --> 01:43:04,740
How do I...

2759
01:43:05,960 --> 01:43:08,260
I want to, like, plant trees.

2760
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:14,960
Oh, my God.

2761
01:43:17,820 --> 01:43:19,100
And then...

2762
01:43:19,100 --> 01:43:20,320
Oh, there it is.

2763
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:22,800
And then...

2764
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:23,160
Oh, wait.

2765
01:43:26,140 --> 01:43:28,600
Oh, how do I plant my trees?

2766
01:43:29,420 --> 01:43:30,140
Do I have...

2767
01:43:30,140 --> 01:43:31,560
Oh, I have to plant it here.

2768
01:43:32,180 --> 01:43:33,220
Oh, okay.

2769
01:43:33,220 --> 01:43:35,280
This is, like, the only place I can plant.

2770
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:36,940
I was like, so...

2771
01:43:36,940 --> 01:43:37,720
I was like, what?

2772
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:38,880
All right.

2773
01:43:39,620 --> 01:43:40,700
One tree.

2774
01:43:43,400 --> 01:43:44,080
Remove.

2775
01:43:44,620 --> 01:43:45,480
I want to remove this.

2776
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:48,800
Okay, remove.

2777
01:43:49,580 --> 01:43:50,380
All right.

2778
01:43:50,540 --> 01:43:52,300
And then tree number two.

2779
01:43:54,820 --> 01:43:56,420
I need to line this.

2780
01:43:57,420 --> 01:43:58,720
Tree number two.

2781
01:44:00,300 --> 01:44:01,840
Tree number three.

2782
01:44:02,340 --> 01:44:03,920
And tree number four.

2783
01:44:04,920 --> 01:44:06,020
Tree number five.

2784
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:06,560
There we go.

2785
01:44:06,700 --> 01:44:07,840
Do I need to water these?

2786
01:44:08,500 --> 01:44:09,420
I don't, right?

2787
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:13,320
These trees aren't demanding for water, right?

2788
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:14,800
No, they're fine.

2789
01:44:15,380 --> 01:44:15,900
All right, nice.

2790
01:44:19,350 --> 01:44:20,190
What's over here?

2791
01:44:21,510 --> 01:44:23,670
Oh, it's just, like, plants that I can grab.

2792
01:44:24,150 --> 01:44:24,630
Do I have enough?

2793
01:44:27,050 --> 01:44:28,130
Where's my wood?

2794
01:44:28,730 --> 01:44:29,570
Okay, I have 24...

2795
01:44:30,590 --> 01:44:31,190
Iron...

2796
01:44:31,190 --> 01:44:31,410
Wait.

2797
01:44:32,030 --> 01:44:33,610
How many rocks do I have?

2798
01:44:33,770 --> 01:44:34,610
Scrap metal.

2799
01:44:35,390 --> 01:44:36,270
Strong claw.

2800
01:44:37,190 --> 01:44:37,790
Onigiri.

2801
01:44:39,590 --> 01:44:41,170
Wait, how much rock do I...

2802
01:44:41,170 --> 01:44:41,870
Wait.

2803
01:44:42,530 --> 01:44:44,590
How do I know how much rock I have?

2804
01:44:47,630 --> 01:44:48,530
I don't know.

2805
01:44:49,770 --> 01:44:50,510
Oh, wait.

2806
01:44:50,510 --> 01:44:50,990
My drums.

2807
01:44:51,150 --> 01:44:52,150
I forgot about my drums.

2808
01:44:53,430 --> 01:44:54,590
Oh, one or three?

2809
01:44:55,110 --> 01:44:56,170
Wait, what's one or three?

2810
01:44:57,510 --> 01:44:58,090
Okay, wait.

2811
01:44:58,210 --> 01:44:58,590
Let's...

2812
01:44:58,590 --> 01:44:59,830
Oh, I forgot to water them.

2813
01:45:01,150 --> 01:45:02,070
Oh, whoops.

2814
01:45:04,470 --> 01:45:04,870
Stop.

2815
01:45:05,230 --> 01:45:05,590
Oh, no.

2816
01:45:07,230 --> 01:45:08,050
Drum time.

2817
01:45:08,390 --> 01:45:08,790
Ooh.

2818
01:45:10,650 --> 01:45:11,190
Yay.

2819
01:45:12,150 --> 01:45:12,850
Drum time.

2820
01:45:14,130 --> 01:45:14,570
All right.

2821
01:45:16,150 --> 01:45:16,990
Drum time.

2822
01:45:17,850 --> 01:45:18,270
Wait.

2823
01:45:19,610 --> 01:45:20,470
Did they not...

2824
01:45:20,470 --> 01:45:21,390
Did they grow?

2825
01:45:21,590 --> 01:45:21,850
Oh, wait.

2826
01:45:21,910 --> 01:45:22,090
They did.

2827
01:45:22,210 --> 01:45:23,110
Oh, I forgot to drum this.

2828
01:45:23,350 --> 01:45:23,870
Drum time.

2829
01:45:24,870 --> 01:45:25,310
Yay.

2830
01:45:26,290 --> 01:45:26,790
All right.

2831
01:45:27,850 --> 01:45:28,250
Wait.

2832
01:45:30,510 --> 01:45:32,730
Oh, they won until their harvest.

2833
01:45:33,110 --> 01:45:33,330
Okay.

2834
01:45:33,510 --> 01:45:33,590
Oh.

2835
01:45:34,050 --> 01:45:34,290
Wait.

2836
01:45:34,290 --> 01:45:35,750
These guys harvested, though.

2837
01:45:38,290 --> 01:45:38,730
All right.

2838
01:45:38,790 --> 01:45:41,750
Let's grab some turnips real fast.

2839
01:45:42,030 --> 01:45:43,290
So I can grab some money.

2840
01:45:44,210 --> 01:45:45,070
And then the...

2841
01:45:45,070 --> 01:45:47,990
And then the Ulalaka would be so happy.

2842
01:45:49,090 --> 01:45:50,530
She'll be so proud of me.

2843
01:45:54,330 --> 01:45:54,890
All right.

2844
01:45:55,090 --> 01:45:56,850
All right.

2845
01:45:56,850 --> 01:45:58,210
There's all my turnips.

2846
01:46:01,720 --> 01:46:02,420
Where are they?

2847
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:03,040
Oh, there it is.

2848
01:46:03,140 --> 01:46:03,500
70...

2849
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:04,080
Oh, my God.

2850
01:46:04,240 --> 01:46:05,480
70 turnips?

2851
01:46:05,860 --> 01:46:06,300
Okay.

2852
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:07,460
That's a lot of turnips.

2853
01:46:08,180 --> 01:46:10,260
How do I know how much...

2854
01:46:10,260 --> 01:46:10,480
Oh.

2855
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:11,400
Oh!

2856
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:12,940
There you go.

2857
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:13,260
Construction.

2858
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:16,760
Oh, I need like 10 more.

2859
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:17,600
Wait.

2860
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:17,760
No.

2861
01:46:17,900 --> 01:46:18,820
I need 20 more.

2862
01:46:19,120 --> 01:46:19,420
Okay.

2863
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:21,060
Okay.

2864
01:46:21,120 --> 01:46:22,480
I need to find more rocks outside.

2865
01:46:24,460 --> 01:46:25,240
That's fine.

2866
01:46:27,460 --> 01:46:28,640
How do I go outside?

2867
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:29,060
How do I go outside?

2868
01:46:29,060 --> 01:46:29,500
It's this way.

2869
01:46:33,160 --> 01:46:33,680
Wait.

2870
01:46:34,240 --> 01:46:35,360
How to go outside?

2871
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:37,180
Oh, it's the other way.

2872
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:38,920
Thank God there's a map.

2873
01:46:39,100 --> 01:46:40,580
I'm very directionally challenged.

2874
01:46:41,140 --> 01:46:41,260
All right.

2875
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:45,540
Yay!

2876
01:46:46,060 --> 01:46:46,840
We're rich!

2877
01:46:47,500 --> 01:46:47,960
All right.

2878
01:46:49,060 --> 01:46:49,320
Wait.

2879
01:46:49,340 --> 01:46:50,320
I'll get some more rocks.

2880
01:46:52,180 --> 01:46:54,620
Is there any more Onyx offerings for me?

2881
01:46:58,910 --> 01:46:59,390
Oh,

2882
01:47:02,530 --> 01:47:03,050
sweep, sweep.

2883
01:47:03,390 --> 01:47:03,610
Nice.

2884
01:47:04,130 --> 01:47:04,770
See, I told you.

2885
01:47:04,890 --> 01:47:06,050
Those offerings were for me.

2886
01:47:09,390 --> 01:47:10,890
I'll just chop it just...

2887
01:47:10,890 --> 01:47:11,710
Just in advance.

2888
01:47:13,850 --> 01:47:14,610
Mine time.

2889
01:47:18,690 --> 01:47:19,170
Nice.

2890
01:47:19,170 --> 01:47:21,930
Was it material stone or just rock, guys?

2891
01:47:22,430 --> 01:47:22,990
Mine time.

2892
01:47:29,270 --> 01:47:29,610
Oh.

2893
01:47:31,190 --> 01:47:32,950
I'll just grab this real fast.

2894
01:47:33,330 --> 01:47:34,150
We don't need more...

2895
01:47:34,150 --> 01:47:36,070
We don't need more trees anyway.

2896
01:47:36,250 --> 01:47:37,570
So we'll leave these guys dead.

2897
01:47:37,890 --> 01:47:38,430
For now.

2898
01:47:39,650 --> 01:47:40,390
Material stone?

2899
01:47:40,590 --> 01:47:40,830
Okay.

2900
01:47:41,090 --> 01:47:41,810
So we're almost done.

2901
01:47:42,310 --> 01:47:44,250
I think after I chop this, it should be over.

2902
01:47:47,410 --> 01:47:47,890
Nice.

2903
01:47:48,210 --> 01:47:48,530
All right.

2904
01:47:48,670 --> 01:47:49,530
Let me double check.

2905
01:47:51,570 --> 01:47:52,330
Oh my god.

2906
01:47:52,330 --> 01:47:53,370
I just need one more.

2907
01:47:53,610 --> 01:47:55,310
I need one more rock.

2908
01:47:59,410 --> 01:48:01,910
I can't go over here, though.

2909
01:48:04,710 --> 01:48:05,430
Oh man.

2910
01:48:05,710 --> 01:48:06,230
I need...

2911
01:48:06,230 --> 01:48:08,850
I guess there might be some more back here.

2912
01:48:10,730 --> 01:48:11,370
Maybe?

2913
01:48:15,510 --> 01:48:16,350
Let's see.

2914
01:48:16,990 --> 01:48:18,650
There might be...

2915
01:48:18,650 --> 01:48:20,190
More rock back here.

2916
01:48:22,630 --> 01:48:23,750
Yeah, I'm looking...

2917
01:48:23,750 --> 01:48:24,450
Oh wait, there it is.

2918
01:48:24,450 --> 01:48:24,970
I see it.

2919
01:48:25,070 --> 01:48:25,890
Yeah, I didn't see that.

2920
01:48:27,270 --> 01:48:28,370
Where's all the rock?

2921
01:48:30,110 --> 01:48:32,270
It's like they tripped it all off.

2922
01:48:35,970 --> 01:48:37,390
There's no more rocks.

2923
01:48:38,850 --> 01:48:39,210
Wait.

2924
01:48:39,350 --> 01:48:39,570
Oh wait.

2925
01:48:39,650 --> 01:48:40,410
There's stuff up here.

2926
01:48:40,830 --> 01:48:41,970
I didn't get to loot this.

2927
01:48:42,050 --> 01:48:43,370
Because I defeated the boss.

2928
01:48:43,930 --> 01:48:44,570
Oh, there's a chicken.

2929
01:48:45,890 --> 01:48:46,450
I have unlimited arrows too.

2930
01:48:49,250 --> 01:48:50,370
Oh my god.

2931
01:48:50,510 --> 01:48:51,630
Okay, that's a lot of damage.

2932
01:48:52,370 --> 01:48:54,270
Oh, and there's like no...

2933
01:48:56,230 --> 01:48:57,970
I have unlimited arrows too.

2934
01:48:58,290 --> 01:48:58,790
That's nice.

2935
01:48:59,210 --> 01:49:00,610
I like that I have unlimited arrows.

2936
01:49:01,610 --> 01:49:01,990
Cannon.

2937
01:49:02,630 --> 01:49:03,190
Equipment.

2938
01:49:05,930 --> 01:49:07,410
Wait, what does that look like?

2939
01:49:09,350 --> 01:49:09,910
Nice.

2940
01:49:10,170 --> 01:49:11,370
I like unlimited arrows.

2941
01:49:11,370 --> 01:49:12,150
Okay, there we go.

2942
01:49:12,670 --> 01:49:14,070
That's the last thing I need in mind.

2943
01:49:15,590 --> 01:49:16,570
What'd you find, huh?

2944
01:49:16,930 --> 01:49:18,530
Got more material stone.

2945
01:49:19,910 --> 01:49:21,710
Oh, I can make a bench now too.

2946
01:49:22,890 --> 01:49:24,670
And then miso and soy sauce.

2947
01:49:24,850 --> 01:49:25,610
Yay, more food.

2948
01:49:27,850 --> 01:49:28,750
Wait, what's that?

2949
01:49:28,970 --> 01:49:29,770
Why is it...

2950
01:49:30,690 --> 01:49:31,950
Why does it look evil?

2951
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:36,740
Why does that look evil?

2952
01:49:36,980 --> 01:49:37,260
Hello?

2953
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:38,460
Are you evil?

2954
01:49:41,100 --> 01:49:41,520
Hello?

2955
01:49:43,780 --> 01:49:45,340
Oh, relive the battle.

2956
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:46,520
Oh, I'll be like...

2957
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:47,460
Hey guys, did you see me?

2958
01:49:47,540 --> 01:49:48,620
We look so cool.

2959
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:49,980
You guys want to see it again?

2960
01:49:53,120 --> 01:49:54,660
Alright, how do I fast travel?

2961
01:49:56,620 --> 01:49:57,040
Save.

2962
01:49:57,780 --> 01:49:59,180
Wait, how do I fast travel?

2963
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:00,560
It says save or do nothing.

2964
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:06,700
Oh, the map.

2965
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:07,960
Oh, it's the map.

2966
01:50:08,140 --> 01:50:08,780
Oh, I see.

2967
01:50:13,720 --> 01:50:14,200
Warp.

2968
01:50:14,580 --> 01:50:15,520
Oh, there it is.

2969
01:50:16,060 --> 01:50:16,660
Oh, okay.

2970
01:50:16,700 --> 01:50:17,860
I want to warp back home.

2971
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:21,140
Spring dragon shrine.

2972
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:23,380
Okay, we gotta go to the construction area.

2973
01:50:25,180 --> 01:50:26,080
I like that.

2974
01:50:27,180 --> 01:50:28,580
I like the fast travel.

2975
01:50:28,580 --> 01:50:29,640
Oh, okay.

2976
01:50:29,640 --> 01:50:32,680
Oh, I don't mean to brag, but I...

2977
01:50:32,680 --> 01:50:32,820
Hey.

2978
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:33,860
Alright.

2979
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:35,360
Oh, construct building.

2980
01:50:35,560 --> 01:50:36,540
On shelves to castles.

2981
01:50:36,580 --> 01:50:37,380
Got all my stuff.

2982
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:39,480
Wait, I just needed 10?

2983
01:50:39,480 --> 01:50:40,660
Oh, I can't read.

2984
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:41,480
I...

2985
01:50:44,780 --> 01:50:45,620
That's okay.

2986
01:50:45,940 --> 01:50:46,760
That's alright.

2987
01:50:47,160 --> 01:50:49,980
That means I have plenty more for later.

2988
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:52,180
Stand back and watch me work.

2989
01:50:52,180 --> 01:50:54,560
Guys, we learned that I still can't read, guys.

2990
01:50:56,620 --> 01:50:58,760
Now that you constructed a building...

2991
01:50:58,760 --> 01:51:02,580
Uh, place in your development stone and it will grant various effects called village bonuses.

2992
01:51:03,120 --> 01:51:05,480
Village bonuses don't just improve the village.

2993
01:51:05,680 --> 01:51:06,960
They boost your stats, too.

2994
01:51:07,540 --> 01:51:12,220
Now note that you can place the same building multiple times, but you'll only receive its village bonus.

2995
01:51:12,340 --> 01:51:13,060
Oh, I can't...

2996
01:51:13,060 --> 01:51:16,340
I can't just fill up my entire village with ramen shop?

2997
01:51:16,780 --> 01:51:17,640
What's the point?

2998
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:22,180
In specific villages, so pay close attention to where you place them.

2999
01:51:22,300 --> 01:51:22,600
Oh, yeah.

3000
01:51:22,640 --> 01:51:23,080
So, yeah, guys.

3001
01:51:23,180 --> 01:51:24,560
There's more than one village, by the way.

3002
01:51:24,860 --> 01:51:26,160
And that's the best part.

3003
01:51:26,360 --> 01:51:28,180
So, that, like, encourages more exploration.

3004
01:51:28,760 --> 01:51:31,100
And more, uh, more explore...

3005
01:51:31,100 --> 01:51:33,320
Like, uh, more village managing.

3006
01:51:34,100 --> 01:51:37,460
That means I can be mayor of several other villages.

3007
01:51:37,620 --> 01:51:38,040
Oh, my God.

3008
01:51:38,120 --> 01:51:40,660
Do you think there's, like, goddesses in other villages?

3009
01:51:45,780 --> 01:51:46,520
All right.

3010
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:49,420
Uh...

3011
01:51:49,420 --> 01:51:50,560
Here, Diller.

3012
01:51:52,040 --> 01:51:52,700
Let's see.

3013
01:51:53,580 --> 01:51:54,780
Place the house.

3014
01:51:57,100 --> 01:51:57,640
Uh...

3015
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:00,400
Where can I place it?

3016
01:52:00,520 --> 01:52:01,160
Oh, back here.

3017
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:03,840
Okay.

3018
01:52:04,100 --> 01:52:05,420
And then, building menu.

3019
01:52:06,740 --> 01:52:09,400
I want to build it right...

3020
01:52:09,820 --> 01:52:12,200
I don't want to build it, like, in...

3021
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:14,880
In my garden.

3022
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:15,960
So, I'll place it here.

3023
01:52:18,480 --> 01:52:19,440
Oh, my God.

3024
01:52:19,540 --> 01:52:20,480
My goddess harem.

3025
01:52:21,440 --> 01:52:23,560
The possibilities are endless.

3026
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:25,880
I'll place it here.

3027
01:52:26,760 --> 01:52:27,060
Yay!

3028
01:52:31,400 --> 01:52:32,720
Oh, and I can move it, too.

3029
01:52:32,720 --> 01:52:33,640
If I don't like it.

3030
01:52:33,740 --> 01:52:34,860
I can move it, like, here.

3031
01:52:36,500 --> 01:52:36,900
Uh...

3032
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:38,320
Mmm...

3033
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:39,800
I'll put it here.

3034
01:52:40,080 --> 01:52:41,260
Just so it looks better.

3035
01:52:42,140 --> 01:52:44,220
So it doesn't look like it's just randomly there.

3036
01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:45,880
All right.

3037
01:52:47,080 --> 01:52:47,480
Turn...

3038
01:52:47,480 --> 01:52:47,780
Oh, yeah.

3039
01:52:48,060 --> 01:52:48,880
Turn in my plaque.

3040
01:52:50,300 --> 01:52:50,900
Press Z.

3041
01:52:51,660 --> 01:52:52,860
Oh, like the building thing?

3042
01:52:52,860 --> 01:52:54,080
Yay!

3043
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:00,920
And I got money!

3044
01:53:02,580 --> 01:53:03,800
I did it!

3045
01:53:05,860 --> 01:53:06,960
Did you see that?

3046
01:53:07,620 --> 01:53:09,540
I made the village even better.

3047
01:53:09,780 --> 01:53:11,200
I need to reintroduce myself.

3048
01:53:12,040 --> 01:53:12,690
By the way...

3049
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:14,780
Are you fond of music?

3050
01:53:14,780 --> 01:53:17,120
I would like to perform with an accomplished dancer such as just some time.

3051
01:53:17,120 --> 01:53:21,180
I am your chosen earth dancer that you ch-ch-ch-chose.

3052
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:23,560
Let's chat.

3053
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:24,400
Hooray!

3054
01:53:26,420 --> 01:53:26,880
Yes?

3055
01:53:27,460 --> 01:53:29,640
Oh, my God.

3056
01:53:30,060 --> 01:53:32,100
Just listen, guys, and you're in.

3057
01:53:33,260 --> 01:53:38,260
Reading a garden book left me a newfound appreciation for people's love of plants.

3058
01:53:38,440 --> 01:53:38,680
Yes?

3059
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:40,820
We could talk even more.

3060
01:53:41,040 --> 01:53:41,260
Yes?

3061
01:53:42,120 --> 01:53:43,560
Wait, how do I give gifts?

3062
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:45,580
Oh, my bond with her grew!

3063
01:53:46,820 --> 01:53:47,340
Wait.

3064
01:53:48,140 --> 01:53:49,260
How do I...

3065
01:53:49,260 --> 01:53:50,500
How do I give her stuff?

3066
01:53:51,320 --> 01:53:52,420
Do you want to turn it?

3067
01:53:53,820 --> 01:53:54,940
I have turn it?

3068
01:53:57,320 --> 01:53:57,840
Oh!

3069
01:53:58,560 --> 01:53:59,600
Do you want...

3070
01:53:59,600 --> 01:54:00,940
Do you want cherry blossoms?

3071
01:54:02,900 --> 01:54:03,420
Hello!

3072
01:54:05,420 --> 01:54:07,260
It's kind of awkward introducing myself.

3073
01:54:07,820 --> 01:54:10,980
Anyway, come visit Susan and me at the tea shop whenever you like.

3074
01:54:11,560 --> 01:54:12,760
Oh, she can cook me stuff.

3075
01:54:12,760 --> 01:54:13,080
Oh, okay.

3076
01:54:13,440 --> 01:54:14,180
What is it?

3077
01:54:14,360 --> 01:54:15,080
And talk to her?

3078
01:54:15,820 --> 01:54:18,600
Days like this make me want to hold an open-air tea ceremony.

3079
01:54:19,120 --> 01:54:23,460
Doesn't sipping tea under a clear blue sky with a nice breeze sound amazing?

3080
01:54:24,060 --> 01:54:24,900
Oh, look at that!

3081
01:54:25,080 --> 01:54:26,240
That's all it takes, guys.

3082
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:27,140
Just listen.

3083
01:54:28,500 --> 01:54:30,200
Oh, I should plant turnips again.

3084
01:54:32,340 --> 01:54:34,380
Oh, water.

3085
01:54:36,320 --> 01:54:36,920
Let's see.

3086
01:54:37,140 --> 01:54:37,240
Let's see.

3087
01:54:37,460 --> 01:54:37,480
Building.

3088
01:54:37,960 --> 01:54:39,400
I can plant cabbages!

3089
01:54:39,960 --> 01:54:41,340
Cabbages with my turnips.

3090
01:54:43,400 --> 01:54:46,000
I'm pretty sure the cabbages will give me more money, too.

3091
01:54:48,640 --> 01:54:49,100
Yeah.

3092
01:54:50,420 --> 01:54:51,300
Oh, my God.

3093
01:54:51,480 --> 01:54:52,580
I have so many turnips.

3094
01:54:53,540 --> 01:54:55,000
And then...

3095
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:55,080
Oh!

3096
01:54:55,300 --> 01:54:55,800
Wrong one.

3097
01:54:57,480 --> 01:54:58,160
Drum time!

3098
01:54:59,820 --> 01:55:00,900
Drum time!

3099
01:55:01,600 --> 01:55:02,320
Yeah!

3100
01:55:06,740 --> 01:55:07,460
No.

3101
01:55:09,060 --> 01:55:10,660
You don't matter to me.

3102
01:55:10,980 --> 01:55:12,440
You're not a waifu.

3103
01:55:13,200 --> 01:55:13,800
All right.

3104
01:55:14,080 --> 01:55:15,020
And then it's time...

3105
01:55:15,020 --> 01:55:15,780
Oh, I have to sleep?

3106
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:17,680
I don't want to sleep.

3107
01:55:18,640 --> 01:55:21,940
There's so many people that want to talk to me.

3108
01:55:23,300 --> 01:55:25,140
Okay, but to progress, I need to sleep.

3109
01:55:25,380 --> 01:55:25,820
You're right.

3110
01:55:26,120 --> 01:55:26,400
Wait.

3111
01:55:26,620 --> 01:55:27,640
Does he have swimsuit?

3112
01:55:30,860 --> 01:55:31,940
Oh, he does.

3113
01:55:32,440 --> 01:55:32,640
Ha!

3114
01:55:33,580 --> 01:55:34,500
Wait, actually...

3115
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:34,840
Ha ha!

3116
01:55:34,980 --> 01:55:35,620
He has a cat.

3117
01:55:35,700 --> 01:55:36,120
I like it.

3118
01:55:36,620 --> 01:55:37,440
Ha ha ha ha!

3119
01:55:37,960 --> 01:55:38,420
Yay!

3120
01:55:40,060 --> 01:55:41,480
My beach episode...

3121
01:55:41,480 --> 01:55:43,460
My never-ending beach episode.

3122
01:55:49,020 --> 01:55:50,080
I need penalties.

3123
01:55:51,160 --> 01:55:52,100
Combat 8.

3124
01:55:52,300 --> 01:55:52,560
Yay!

3125
01:55:53,420 --> 01:55:54,900
I got all that XP.

3126
01:55:58,540 --> 01:55:59,220
It's okay.

3127
01:55:59,340 --> 01:56:00,700
I can revive them with my...

3128
01:56:00,700 --> 01:56:01,580
With my dancing.

3129
01:56:04,700 --> 01:56:06,640
Isn't tomorrow Murasame's birthday?

3130
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:09,000
You should get a present that really wows him.

3131
01:56:12,740 --> 01:56:14,020
Wait, but we just met.

3132
01:56:16,060 --> 01:56:17,560
My present is his...

3133
01:56:17,560 --> 01:56:17,860
Ha ha!

3134
01:56:18,120 --> 01:56:19,360
I already got him a present.

3135
01:56:19,360 --> 01:56:20,480
It's his swimsuit.

3136
01:56:20,980 --> 01:56:21,920
Ha ha ha ha!

3137
01:56:24,020 --> 01:56:26,620
Isn't that enough of a gift on its own?

3138
01:56:28,080 --> 01:56:28,560
Yes!

3139
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:30,560
I should...

3140
01:56:30,560 --> 01:56:32,260
I should farm a little bit of the trees.

3141
01:56:34,060 --> 01:56:35,300
I think this game is like...

3142
01:56:35,300 --> 01:56:36,820
This game is pretty relaxing.

3143
01:56:39,460 --> 01:56:40,720
Oh, it gets like lumber.

3144
01:56:41,420 --> 01:56:42,620
Does it not give cherry blossoms?

3145
01:56:43,060 --> 01:56:44,060
Oh, so like...

3146
01:56:44,060 --> 01:56:46,160
My regular trees doesn't give cherry blossoms.

3147
01:56:46,420 --> 01:56:46,780
I see.

3148
01:56:48,980 --> 01:56:49,920
It's very relaxing.

3149
01:56:50,060 --> 01:56:51,840
But you guys want to check out the game.

3150
01:56:53,700 --> 01:56:55,560
Click on the link on the chat in the description.

3151
01:56:56,580 --> 01:56:57,380
My cabbages!

3152
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:00,960
Oh, I thought it was ready.

3153
01:57:01,940 --> 01:57:03,060
I was going to be like...

3154
01:57:03,060 --> 01:57:03,240
Yay!

3155
01:57:04,180 --> 01:57:05,440
Look at them grow!

3156
01:57:07,180 --> 01:57:08,640
Yeah, it's very relaxing.

3157
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:09,860
I do like farming games.

3158
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:10,320
I play...

3159
01:57:10,320 --> 01:57:12,840
I tend to play farming games off stream if I just want to relax.

3160
01:57:14,200 --> 01:57:15,160
Okay, let's...

3161
01:57:15,160 --> 01:57:17,260
I'll send that and the cabbages too.

3162
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:18,960
Yay!

3163
01:57:19,240 --> 01:57:19,880
I'm rich!

3164
01:57:22,300 --> 01:57:24,340
Oh, Ulalaka wants to talk to me.

3165
01:57:24,640 --> 01:57:26,320
Wait, but is there any new quest?

3166
01:57:26,720 --> 01:57:28,060
No, no new quest.

3167
01:57:30,020 --> 01:57:30,660
Don't worry.

3168
01:57:31,040 --> 01:57:31,520
Sweep, sweep, sweep.

3169
01:57:32,380 --> 01:57:33,140
Sweep, sweep, sweep.

3170
01:57:33,580 --> 01:57:34,360
Did you see that?

3171
01:57:34,460 --> 01:57:35,020
I sweeped!

3172
01:57:36,100 --> 01:57:38,880
You're still doing your part to revitalize the village.

3173
01:57:39,060 --> 01:57:40,680
I greatly appreciate it.

3174
01:57:40,680 --> 01:57:43,580
I can feel my divinity returning to me.

3175
01:57:43,880 --> 01:57:45,920
Let me grant you my blessing here.

3176
01:57:46,840 --> 01:57:47,960
Level 3!

3177
01:57:48,900 --> 01:57:50,300
Now support's up to 8.

3178
01:57:50,460 --> 01:57:51,160
Wait, how long?

3179
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:51,640
8?

3180
01:57:52,300 --> 01:57:54,900
You mean there's only 6 people here before?

3181
01:57:55,780 --> 01:57:57,840
Oh, I can have 65 decorations.

3182
01:57:58,220 --> 01:58:00,300
And consign villagers to mining.

3183
01:58:00,820 --> 01:58:02,240
Into the mines you go.

3184
01:58:02,600 --> 01:58:04,960
Oh, I can have them farm for me!

3185
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:08,000
That's right.

3186
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:08,940
Yay!

3187
01:58:09,780 --> 01:58:10,380
Delegations!

3188
01:58:12,840 --> 01:58:14,360
Johnny, thank you for the super chat.

3189
01:58:14,500 --> 01:58:15,300
Thank you, thank you.

3190
01:58:15,580 --> 01:58:18,340
In the words of a certain police detective, great vegetables.

3191
01:58:19,780 --> 01:58:20,000
Alright.

3192
01:58:20,780 --> 01:58:23,840
Then, you can make your villagers into farmers from the villagers' menu.

3193
01:58:24,040 --> 01:58:26,400
Those assigned a farmer will perform 3 key tasks.

3194
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:33,820
Find any seed you own in open fields, water crops, and harvest fully grown crops and place them in the shipping shed.

3195
01:58:35,740 --> 01:58:36,660
Oh, nice.

3196
01:58:37,640 --> 01:58:38,520
Yay, delegation!

3197
01:58:39,420 --> 01:58:41,160
Okay, and then you can have them chop wood.

3198
01:58:42,780 --> 01:58:47,040
Oh, if they deforest everything, the loggers will venture outside.

3199
01:58:47,420 --> 01:58:47,980
Alright, nice.

3200
01:58:48,280 --> 01:58:49,880
Let's hope the goblins don't get them.

3201
01:58:51,380 --> 01:58:52,500
And then, what's the mining?

3202
01:58:54,700 --> 01:58:57,180
Villagers assigned, can collect material stone and ore for you.

3203
01:58:57,280 --> 01:58:58,960
All materials will go to the storage box.

3204
01:59:03,170 --> 01:59:05,250
How wonderfully inspiring.

3205
01:59:06,410 --> 01:59:07,510
What is it?

3206
01:59:08,350 --> 01:59:09,350
Oh, pardon me.

3207
01:59:09,550 --> 01:59:11,110
I got ahead of myself.

3208
01:59:11,450 --> 01:59:13,890
I'm just so moved by your work.

3209
01:59:14,350 --> 01:59:19,410
To think you will build houses and grow our population so fast.

3210
01:59:20,690 --> 01:59:22,610
Wait, there are more people already?

3211
01:59:23,230 --> 01:59:23,810
Why?

3212
01:59:24,730 --> 01:59:25,370
Well...

3213
01:59:25,370 --> 01:59:31,210
The wind must have carried tales of your efforts to the eyes and ears of those who would return.

3214
01:59:31,830 --> 01:59:33,090
That was fast!

3215
01:59:33,950 --> 01:59:38,890
If we continue to restore the village, people will surely come blocking to it.

3216
01:59:39,850 --> 01:59:40,490
Yeah.

3217
01:59:40,970 --> 01:59:42,870
Guess that means we best get to work.

3218
01:59:43,090 --> 01:59:43,610
My God.

3219
01:59:44,110 --> 01:59:47,210
That old village chief should have retired earlier, guys.

3220
01:59:48,290 --> 01:59:48,890
Look at me.

3221
01:59:48,950 --> 01:59:51,510
I was village chief for one day.

3222
01:59:51,510 --> 01:59:53,490
And I already fixed everything.

3223
01:59:55,110 --> 01:59:57,450
Your kindness truly know no bounds.

3224
02:00:00,470 --> 02:00:01,090
Well...

3225
02:00:01,090 --> 02:00:03,290
Actually, I find myself thinking I had to...

3226
02:00:03,290 --> 02:00:04,870
I made it home so good.

3227
02:00:05,090 --> 02:00:06,810
I had to reward your kindness.

3228
02:00:07,690 --> 02:00:12,610
So early this morning, I gathered all the villagers and asked them to offer you...

3229
02:00:12,610 --> 02:00:14,850
Aw, I just wanted your help.

3230
02:00:15,250 --> 02:00:16,170
Oh, la la call.

3231
02:00:16,490 --> 02:00:16,990
Hooray!

3232
02:00:17,350 --> 02:00:20,650
To my surprise, I hardly needed to ask.

3233
02:00:20,650 --> 02:00:23,530
They all have been waiting for such an opportunity.

3234
02:00:24,070 --> 02:00:24,590
Wow!

3235
02:00:24,770 --> 02:00:26,590
Wow, that's good news!

3236
02:00:27,230 --> 02:00:27,750
Indeed.

3237
02:00:28,310 --> 02:00:29,570
So you need assistance with your crops?

3238
02:00:29,770 --> 02:00:31,550
Then the villagers are here to help.

3239
02:00:31,790 --> 02:00:32,290
Hohoho!

3240
02:00:34,470 --> 02:00:35,330
And that's all.

3241
02:00:35,710 --> 02:00:37,270
Should you require lumber or stone?

3242
02:00:37,610 --> 02:00:39,470
Then they can help with that as well.

3243
02:00:39,650 --> 02:00:40,050
Farewell.

3244
02:00:40,490 --> 02:00:42,450
Now, shall we ask for their aid?

3245
02:00:42,690 --> 02:00:42,950
Yes.

3246
02:00:43,950 --> 02:00:44,470
Delegation!

3247
02:00:44,470 --> 02:00:44,750
Delegation!

3248
02:00:45,650 --> 02:00:46,330
It's time!

3249
02:00:47,230 --> 02:00:48,890
I love delegation!

3250
02:00:50,210 --> 02:00:51,390
Wait, move villages?

3251
02:00:51,730 --> 02:00:52,750
Oh yeah, I just have one.

3252
02:00:53,810 --> 02:00:55,770
Uh, you know what?

3253
02:00:55,870 --> 02:00:56,790
We need more trees.

3254
02:00:57,190 --> 02:00:57,910
Okay, there we go.

3255
02:00:58,310 --> 02:00:59,390
Farm, farm, farm tree.

3256
02:01:00,050 --> 02:01:02,410
This would make the life a whole lot easier.

3257
02:01:02,710 --> 02:01:03,070
Thank you very much.

3258
02:01:03,290 --> 02:01:04,470
Thank you so much, Ulalaka.

3259
02:01:05,190 --> 02:01:06,990
It's my, it's my pleasure.

3260
02:01:07,450 --> 02:01:07,710
Mm-hmm.

3261
02:01:08,670 --> 02:01:12,030
Though we may have some trouble if our population grows too large.

3262
02:01:12,670 --> 02:01:13,650
Did you say something?

3263
02:01:14,030 --> 02:01:14,050
What?

3264
02:01:14,490 --> 02:01:16,050
No, not a word.

3265
02:01:16,310 --> 02:01:16,670
Farewell.

3266
02:01:17,050 --> 02:01:19,170
Once again, you have my thanks.

3267
02:01:19,650 --> 02:01:20,750
Now you'll excuse me.

3268
02:01:21,250 --> 02:01:21,590
Hmm.

3269
02:01:22,870 --> 02:01:27,190
Am I imagining things or does she still have something on her mind just now?

3270
02:01:27,650 --> 02:01:29,170
No, she definitely did.

3271
02:01:29,350 --> 02:01:30,790
And I want to know what.

3272
02:01:31,130 --> 02:01:34,390
Come on, let's go talk to Ulalaka one more time.

3273
02:01:34,670 --> 02:01:35,750
Okay, wait, but it's his birthday.

3274
02:01:35,850 --> 02:01:37,010
Let me wish him a happy birthday.

3275
02:01:37,310 --> 02:01:39,390
To introduce myself, my name is Murasame.

3276
02:01:39,550 --> 02:01:42,170
I seek to become the world's greatest swordsman.

3277
02:01:42,590 --> 02:01:44,210
I'm always happy...

3278
02:01:44,210 --> 02:01:44,550
Happy birthday, man!

3279
02:01:44,690 --> 02:01:46,730
Did you like my, the swimsuit I got you?

3280
02:01:47,310 --> 02:01:47,790
Hmm.

3281
02:01:49,870 --> 02:01:52,630
Sometimes I fail to detect Sir Sakaki's prisons.

3282
02:01:52,990 --> 02:01:54,690
There's more to them than meets the eye.

3283
02:01:56,090 --> 02:01:56,630
It's your birth...

3284
02:01:56,630 --> 02:01:57,590
Happy birthday, buddy.

3285
02:01:58,150 --> 02:01:58,310
Right.

3286
02:01:58,790 --> 02:01:59,270
And what is it?

3287
02:01:59,270 --> 02:01:59,930
Happy birthday.

3288
02:02:00,490 --> 02:02:01,470
It's your birthday.

3289
02:02:02,910 --> 02:02:04,070
Want me to dance?

3290
02:02:05,770 --> 02:02:06,770
Are you happy?

3291
02:02:07,970 --> 02:02:09,310
He doesn't appreciate me.

3292
02:02:09,310 --> 02:02:10,030
This is why...

3293
02:02:10,030 --> 02:02:11,750
This is why I went for the waifus.

3294
02:02:11,990 --> 02:02:13,950
They appreciate my dance...

3295
02:02:13,950 --> 02:02:14,530
Oh, it's tomorrow.

3296
02:02:14,650 --> 02:02:15,250
Sorry, I can't read.

3297
02:02:15,390 --> 02:02:16,030
Oh, hey!

3298
02:02:17,130 --> 02:02:17,830
Hey, Hina!

3299
02:02:21,510 --> 02:02:21,950
Sorry.

3300
02:02:22,210 --> 02:02:24,010
I'm really bad with reading comprehension.

3301
02:02:26,450 --> 02:02:28,290
English is my first language, guys.

3302
02:02:31,490 --> 02:02:34,410
I can't be the only one who envies the people here, right?

3303
02:02:34,750 --> 02:02:38,710
I mean, just imagine and enjoy the cherry blossoms whenever you wanted.

3304
02:02:39,810 --> 02:02:40,530
All right.

3305
02:02:41,410 --> 02:02:41,690
Okay.

3306
02:02:42,170 --> 02:02:43,770
Ulalaka is hiding something.

3307
02:02:44,070 --> 02:02:45,750
You can tell me anything.

3308
02:02:46,470 --> 02:02:47,310
Oh, look at them.

3309
02:02:47,490 --> 02:02:47,850
Yay!

3310
02:02:48,310 --> 02:02:48,910
Delegation!

3311
02:02:50,430 --> 02:02:52,830
I don't have to do actual farming now.

3312
02:02:52,930 --> 02:02:53,490
Let's go!

3313
02:02:56,810 --> 02:02:57,410
Oh!

3314
02:02:57,750 --> 02:02:58,090
Oh!

3315
02:02:58,470 --> 02:03:01,030
I didn't expect to see you both again so soon.

3316
02:03:01,190 --> 02:03:01,390
Hey!

3317
02:03:02,050 --> 02:03:03,170
Be honest with us here.

3318
02:03:03,390 --> 02:03:05,010
Is something still bothering you?

3319
02:03:05,610 --> 02:03:06,090
Well...

3320
02:03:06,090 --> 02:03:06,810
Well, yes.

3321
02:03:07,130 --> 02:03:09,270
I must handle some things on my own.

3322
02:03:09,630 --> 02:03:10,650
Gotta love them.

3323
02:03:10,890 --> 02:03:12,430
Don't give us that.

3324
02:03:12,670 --> 02:03:13,730
We're friends, right?

3325
02:03:13,950 --> 02:03:14,970
Let us help.

3326
02:03:15,770 --> 02:03:17,050
And we can be more than friends if you want.

3327
02:03:17,410 --> 02:03:17,890
Ulalaka.

3328
02:03:19,010 --> 02:03:19,970
Oh, you too?

3329
02:03:21,830 --> 02:03:23,330
I tell the truth.

3330
02:03:24,050 --> 02:03:24,270
That's happy.

3331
02:03:24,370 --> 02:03:24,630
Wait.

3332
02:03:25,070 --> 02:03:26,670
I can have a child, right?

3333
02:03:27,390 --> 02:03:28,590
Oh my god!

3334
02:03:29,250 --> 02:03:31,870
Wait, I can have a child with the goddess?

3335
02:03:33,610 --> 02:03:36,210
As happy as I am to see our village grow.

3336
02:03:37,110 --> 02:03:38,590
Oh my god!

3337
02:03:39,210 --> 02:03:41,890
My child will be so strong!

3338
02:03:42,850 --> 02:03:46,590
We all know demigods are one of the strongest out there!

3339
02:03:48,750 --> 02:03:51,870
Our harvest can hardly feed the current population.

3340
02:03:52,650 --> 02:03:53,330
Everyone...

3341
02:03:53,330 --> 02:03:55,810
I literally harvested 70 turnips.

3342
02:03:57,430 --> 02:03:58,670
Everyone is working.

3343
02:03:58,670 --> 02:04:00,650
We have eight villagers.

3344
02:04:01,110 --> 02:04:01,490
What do you...

3345
02:04:01,490 --> 02:04:02,490
No, we have four!

3346
02:04:02,790 --> 02:04:04,190
We have four villagers!

3347
02:04:04,190 --> 02:04:07,190
What do you mean we don't have enough crops?

3348
02:04:08,550 --> 02:04:09,990
Our hate for...

3349
02:04:09,990 --> 02:04:12,130
hunger to be the only reward.

3350
02:04:12,490 --> 02:04:12,810
Gotcha!

3351
02:04:13,250 --> 02:04:15,210
I can see why that worry you.

3352
02:04:15,530 --> 02:04:16,390
Leave it to me!

3353
02:04:17,470 --> 02:04:19,810
We're gonna have the potato diet, guys.

3354
02:04:20,450 --> 02:04:21,450
But leave it to us!

3355
02:04:21,590 --> 02:04:26,350
If there's any job that the descendant of a legendary dragon and an earth dancer can't handle...

3356
02:04:26,350 --> 02:04:26,970
This is it!

3357
02:04:27,610 --> 02:04:29,070
You'll do this for me?

3358
02:04:29,290 --> 02:04:29,590
Right.

3359
02:04:30,510 --> 02:04:31,530
Of course!

3360
02:04:31,810 --> 02:04:32,510
My thanks.

3361
02:04:32,670 --> 02:04:33,670
Oh, how wonderful!

3362
02:04:34,130 --> 02:04:35,730
I don't know how to thank you!

3363
02:04:35,890 --> 02:04:36,330
Farewell.

3364
02:04:36,710 --> 02:04:39,670
You'll be doing this village a great service!

3365
02:04:41,570 --> 02:04:43,650
It costs code every day to...

3366
02:04:43,650 --> 02:04:44,130
What?

3367
02:04:47,600 --> 02:04:49,060
These expenses come...

3368
02:04:49,060 --> 02:04:50,580
I have turnips!

3369
02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:52,400
Why are you...

3370
02:04:54,200 --> 02:04:55,160
Excuse me!

3371
02:04:55,520 --> 02:04:56,120
Um...

3372
02:04:56,120 --> 02:04:58,320
This is a turnip diet right now?

3373
02:04:59,920 --> 02:05:00,520
Like...

3374
02:05:03,760 --> 02:05:07,940
And since you're the chief, village assets in your pocket are one and the same.

3375
02:05:08,360 --> 02:05:13,100
Yet insufficient funds are not able to pay the village's happiness will drop.

3376
02:05:15,640 --> 02:05:18,360
Ask villagers directly if they have any...

3377
02:05:18,360 --> 02:05:19,700
How dare you!

3378
02:05:19,900 --> 02:05:22,920
How can they not appreciate my turnip diet?

3379
02:05:25,240 --> 02:05:27,600
Ireland was so happy about potatoes.

3380
02:05:28,420 --> 02:05:31,120
It's not like there was a fat in it or anything.

3381
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:33,420
To receive personal requests.

3382
02:05:33,940 --> 02:05:37,840
Completing these will grant your rewards and also raise your bond level with requesters.

3383
02:05:38,580 --> 02:05:38,900
Alright.

3384
02:05:39,720 --> 02:05:40,940
What was your request?

3385
02:05:43,560 --> 02:05:47,900
Seeing your fate at this early hour is a good omen, my little bird.

3386
02:05:47,900 --> 02:05:50,040
Oh my god.

3387
02:05:50,600 --> 02:05:52,320
She broke the fourth wall.

3388
02:05:53,340 --> 02:05:54,960
Plenty seemed pleased as well.

3389
02:05:55,140 --> 02:05:56,140
Oh my god.

3390
02:05:56,400 --> 02:05:58,460
She's actually talking to me, guys.

3391
02:05:58,860 --> 02:06:00,140
Oh my god.

3392
02:06:01,460 --> 02:06:02,240
Do you have any requests?

3393
02:06:02,580 --> 02:06:03,880
I ask for your help with something.

3394
02:06:03,880 --> 02:06:05,620
Plenty more fields in the dev zone.

3395
02:06:05,800 --> 02:06:06,200
Oh, okay.

3396
02:06:06,980 --> 02:06:08,120
You have my gratitude.

3397
02:06:09,540 --> 02:06:10,060
Uh...

3398
02:06:10,060 --> 02:06:11,160
We'll need more fields.

3399
02:06:12,600 --> 02:06:13,140
All good.

3400
02:06:13,420 --> 02:06:15,220
The villagers can take care of planning great.

3401
02:06:15,220 --> 02:06:16,940
We just need to give them a place to do that.

3402
02:06:17,300 --> 02:06:17,740
She knows.

3403
02:06:18,120 --> 02:06:20,840
She broke the fourth wall just to talk to me.

3404
02:06:22,400 --> 02:06:22,820
Whoops.

3405
02:06:23,780 --> 02:06:24,700
You didn't see that.

3406
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:26,100
You didn't see that, guys.

3407
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:28,260
Okay.

3408
02:06:28,980 --> 02:06:30,200
I need to talk to Woobly.

3409
02:06:32,180 --> 02:06:34,460
Okay, we need terrain files.

3410
02:06:35,980 --> 02:06:37,200
And we need two more.

3411
02:06:38,240 --> 02:06:38,560
Yo, guys.

3412
02:06:38,680 --> 02:06:39,360
You didn't see that.

3413
02:06:40,160 --> 02:06:41,380
It was a love shot.

3414
02:06:41,800 --> 02:06:43,860
It's like Cupid chat.

3415
02:06:43,860 --> 02:06:45,760
Okay, I'm good.

3416
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:47,260
And then building menu.

3417
02:06:48,360 --> 02:06:48,500
Okay.

3418
02:06:49,560 --> 02:06:50,100
Place.

3419
02:06:50,420 --> 02:06:51,620
And then...

3420
02:06:51,620 --> 02:06:52,500
I'll place one here.

3421
02:06:52,680 --> 02:06:52,900
Yes!

3422
02:06:53,420 --> 02:06:54,740
And then...

3423
02:06:54,740 --> 02:06:56,480
My people can...

3424
02:06:56,480 --> 02:06:58,360
I've delegated it to my people.

3425
02:06:58,580 --> 02:07:00,500
I completed your personal request.

3426
02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:02,680
Yay!

3427
02:07:04,160 --> 02:07:05,620
I got bamboo.

3428
02:07:07,680 --> 02:07:08,760
Nature's grace.

3429
02:07:08,760 --> 02:07:08,820
Nice.

3430
02:07:09,300 --> 02:07:10,460
You work swiftly.

3431
02:07:11,300 --> 02:07:14,100
I see earth dancers are not to be underestimated.

3432
02:07:15,320 --> 02:07:16,600
Don't forget me.

3433
02:07:16,920 --> 02:07:17,260
Yes.

3434
02:07:17,600 --> 02:07:19,160
I would never, Lord Woobly.

3435
02:07:19,480 --> 02:07:20,160
My thanks.

3436
02:07:20,360 --> 02:07:21,840
Thank you both very much.

3437
02:07:22,340 --> 02:07:24,640
I hope I might be more of an assistant to you.

3438
02:07:24,940 --> 02:07:27,080
But all I can offer is the building recipe.

3439
02:07:27,360 --> 02:07:27,960
Yes, yes.

3440
02:07:28,080 --> 02:07:29,640
But it's your building recipe.

3441
02:07:30,380 --> 02:07:31,500
You're too humble.

3442
02:07:31,800 --> 02:07:33,120
This is more than enough.

3443
02:07:34,140 --> 02:07:35,920
I appreciate your kindness.

3444
02:07:36,860 --> 02:07:38,600
Oh, I can make a blacksmith.

3445
02:07:42,280 --> 02:07:42,800
Okay.

3446
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:47,420
What's that?

3447
02:07:48,440 --> 02:07:50,600
Curiosity seems to have gotten better of you, Suzu.

3448
02:07:50,940 --> 02:07:52,400
Much like it has with me.

3449
02:07:53,180 --> 02:07:54,320
Hey there, you two.

3450
02:07:55,800 --> 02:07:56,320
Interesting.

3451
02:07:56,980 --> 02:07:58,980
Some sort of blacksmithing blueprint?

3452
02:07:59,300 --> 02:08:00,040
I take it?

3453
02:08:00,480 --> 02:08:01,000
Wow.

3454
02:08:01,340 --> 02:08:03,280
Wow, you can tell with just one look?

3455
02:08:03,940 --> 02:08:06,080
You learn a lot when you travel the world.

3456
02:08:06,780 --> 02:08:07,880
You sure do.

3457
02:08:08,920 --> 02:08:12,420
But what are we going to do about proper blacksmith to run the place?

3458
02:08:12,580 --> 02:08:12,700
Hmm?

3459
02:08:13,840 --> 02:08:15,940
You don't want to have one here in the village?

3460
02:08:16,160 --> 02:08:16,520
Aww.

3461
02:08:16,960 --> 02:08:17,460
We do.

3462
02:08:17,700 --> 02:08:18,380
Or we did.

3463
02:08:18,840 --> 02:08:19,820
No one's seen...

3464
02:08:19,820 --> 02:08:22,180
And no one tried to find him?

3465
02:08:22,740 --> 02:08:23,540
Ha ha ha ha.

3466
02:08:25,200 --> 02:08:26,900
No one's seen Kihachi.

3467
02:08:27,360 --> 02:08:27,840
Okay.

3468
02:08:28,080 --> 02:08:31,520
I think some of these missing villagers aren't villagers that moved out.

3469
02:08:31,700 --> 02:08:33,660
Like, I think they're actually missing, missing.

3470
02:08:34,920 --> 02:08:36,560
People are growing concerned.

3471
02:08:37,240 --> 02:08:39,220
A healer's family has been searching for him.

3472
02:08:39,880 --> 02:08:47,000
In fact, rumor has it he was seen transforming into a strange red oni in the spring highlands.

3473
02:08:47,780 --> 02:08:48,760
Say what?

3474
02:08:49,840 --> 02:08:51,340
Stop it, Mario.

3475
02:08:51,740 --> 02:08:53,320
No more scary stories.

3476
02:08:53,860 --> 02:08:54,580
Me dispiace.

3477
02:08:55,320 --> 02:08:56,780
And that's a theory.

3478
02:08:57,020 --> 02:08:58,000
A game theory.

3479
02:08:58,400 --> 02:09:00,320
I'm only sharing what I've heard.

3480
02:09:01,100 --> 02:09:03,420
Or say we look into the blacksmith thing.

3481
02:09:03,720 --> 02:09:05,680
We could use some decent weapons after all.

3482
02:09:07,280 --> 02:09:08,440
Oh, okay.

3483
02:09:08,760 --> 02:09:10,580
So now we got the blacksmith mission.

3484
02:09:11,080 --> 02:09:11,800
Oh my gosh.

3485
02:09:12,340 --> 02:09:13,840
There's so much to do here.

3486
02:09:15,280 --> 02:09:21,260
I hear like this this game you can play it's like a very, very, very, very, very long play time.

3487
02:09:21,460 --> 02:09:24,240
So like you're basically getting like you know your money's worth.

3488
02:09:25,020 --> 02:09:26,440
Oh yeah, you can upgrade your weapons.

3489
02:09:26,780 --> 02:09:27,260
Yay!

3490
02:09:27,920 --> 02:09:29,060
Wait, I need to chop this too.

3491
02:09:29,060 --> 02:09:32,940
I want to get more seeds for my delegated workers.

3492
02:09:33,780 --> 02:09:36,820
Yeah, definitely like a lot of time you can invest in it.

3493
02:09:36,920 --> 02:09:38,580
Because like there's so many different elements.

3494
02:09:38,820 --> 02:09:41,200
Like farming, RPG, fighting.

3495
02:09:41,740 --> 02:09:42,960
I like the combat.

3496
02:09:43,220 --> 02:09:44,200
I think the combat's really fun.

3497
02:09:44,320 --> 02:09:49,420
Especially like I think like like the charge attack.

3498
02:09:49,560 --> 02:09:53,060
Like when I did the boss fight I really, really liked the boss fight for that.

3499
02:09:53,280 --> 02:09:53,940
Because it was fun.

3500
02:09:54,440 --> 02:09:56,200
And I'd be like drum.

3501
02:09:58,500 --> 02:10:00,720
30 hours in and still not close to finishing.

3502
02:10:00,920 --> 02:10:05,620
Yeah, so like and even after like the main storyline like you got there's like other stuff you can do as well.

3503
02:10:05,700 --> 02:10:09,080
Because there's like several villages you can micromanage as well.
