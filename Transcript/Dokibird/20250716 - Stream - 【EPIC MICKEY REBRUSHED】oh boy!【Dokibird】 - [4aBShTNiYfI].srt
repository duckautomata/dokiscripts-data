1
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,960
Good morning, everyone.

2
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,440
Yes, I know it's 5 p.m.

3
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,660
Um, but I just woke up from my nap, so I'm here now.

4
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,400
Yeah, I had... I... Every time, I always get tricked.

5
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,200
I'm always like, it's alright.

6
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,400
It's just a little nappy-wap.

7
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,620
You wouldn't hurt anybody.

8
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,760
But I'm always wrong.

9
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:05,800
I'm always wrong.

10
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,560
I always think it'll be different, you know?

11
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,940
I'm like, don't worry.

12
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,620
This nap, this nap will be different.

13
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:15,100
I'll be so energized afterwards.

14
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:19,120
Because this time, I'm a different person this time.

15
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,700
And my body... My body can do it.

16
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,540
I believe in myself.

17
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,440
And then I wake up from my nap.

18
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,060
And I'm like, oh my god, why did I do that?

19
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,780
Why did I...

20
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,240
You are not different, Doki.

21
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,060
You are still the same, Doki.

22
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,940
A nap will not solve anything.

23
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,320
Why did you do that?

24
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,400
You could have just stayed up.

25
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,480
You could have just, I don't know, drank some game or something.

26
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,120
By the way, use my code DokiBerry for time.

27
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,340
Every time.

28
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,340
I was like, why did you do this, Doki?

29
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,200
Pass, pass Doki.

30
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,560
Why did you do this to me?

31
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,020
We could have just stayed up.

32
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:54,420
Why?

33
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,080
I just, oh my god.

34
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,820
I feel like I'm dying right now.

35
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:10,580
Anyway, um, um, today, um, she never learns.

36
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,520
Girl failure.

37
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,020
Yo, she did you the super chat.

38
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,860
Thank you, thank you.

39
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,800
Uh, today, we're gonna be finally playing a game that I've been meaning to play for the longest time.

40
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,680
It is Epic Mickey Rebrushed, which is the remastered version of the original Epic Mickey.

41
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:35,160
I remember seeing a clip of, like, a comparison between, um, the old, uh, the graphics between the old Epic Mickey versus the remastered version.

42
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,000
And it's, like, night and day, basically.

43
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:45,660
Like, it's a remaster that actually improves the quality of life changes and, um, improves the graphics in a way that doesn't make fans angry.

44
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,280
Yay!

45
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,860
Because I feel like that's always, like, such a risky thing when you try to, like, remaster something.

46
00:05:53,140 --> 00:06:00,460
Like, you have to do it in a way that doesn't piss off the fans who, uh, you know, who like the original.

47
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:06,860
And also, like, do it in a way that satisfies the nostalgic feeling but also improves upon it.

48
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:11,680
And, um, there's a lot of remasters out there that doesn't do any of those things.

49
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,960
Like, the World of Warcraft one, the World of Warcraft RTS one, which everyone wants to deny never happened.

50
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,020
But it's too late.

51
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,740
They deleted the OG version.

52
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,900
So you have to play the remastered version.

53
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:29,480
Or, or, apparently, a lot of them are, like, RTS themed, too.

54
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:36,840
So, yeah, like, the, sorry, the World of Warcraft 3.

55
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,900
What, what never happened?

56
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,660
It's just, oh, sorry, it's just Warcraft 3.

57
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:46,920
I always see World of Warcraft, like, all the, like, the spinoffs, um, and everything.

58
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,940
It's just World of Warcraft to me.

59
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,160
I, like, I don't know.

60
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:50,780
It's just wow.

61
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,860
Um, so, like, I know it's, like, Warcraft 3.

62
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:58,460
But, um, but to me, I just see it as World of Warcraft.

63
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,560
Uh, World of World of Warcraft.

64
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:00,840
Yeah.

65
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,020
Like, I categorize everything into wow.

66
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:14,120
But yeah, apparently, World of Warcraft is technically the spin.

67
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:14,880
Wait, is it?

68
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:19,440
I thought... I don't know why I thought that Warcraft... Wait, RTS was first?

69
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,480
Before the MMO?

70
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,120
Oh my god, Blizzard rewrote history.

71
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,720
Blizzard successfully rewrote history.

72
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:40,800
I feel like if you ever ask the newer generation, I don't think people would think that World of Warcraft would have been the first game from the series.

73
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:45,000
I think... I did not... Yeah, it's almost like, Warcraft is an RTS?

74
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:48,560
Like...

75
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,460
Please...

76
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,160
I thought... I honestly thought...

77
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,120
WoW was like... came first.

78
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,460
I didn't realize the RTS version was second.

79
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,220
Oh, sorry.

80
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,360
I mean, the RTS version was first.

81
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,000
Anyway...

82
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,240
Where was that?

83
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:09,940
Oh yeah, but yeah.

84
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,320
I heard the remaster was...

85
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:12,700
Um...

86
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,800
Did very well in terms of satisfying the original fans.

87
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,780
But I never grew up...

88
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,200
Grew up with Epic Mickey.

89
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,100
Um...

90
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,360
Well, in a way where...

91
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,260
I never got to play Epic Mickey.

92
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:24,880
Because...

93
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,400
It came out on the Wii.

94
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,640
And at that time, like I said...

95
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,980
My dad wouldn't get me any Nintendo...

96
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,060
Nintendo...

97
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:32,460
Nintendo...

98
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:32,600
Nintendo...

99
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,360
Wouldn't get me any Nintendo consoles.

100
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,320
So...

101
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,100
I was never...

102
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,140
I never owned a Wii.

103
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:43,020
So I never had a chance to play any games that came out on the Wii itself.

104
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,360
So any games that like...

105
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:44,920
You know, like...

106
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,340
Um...

107
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,940
I don't even know any famous games that came out on the Wii.

108
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,980
But I never had a chance to play any of those games.

109
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,520
Um...

110
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,300
So...

111
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:53,540
Uh...

112
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,340
This will be my first time experiencing Epic Mickey.

113
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,240
Uh...

114
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,340
General, thank you for the Super Chat.

115
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,180
Thank you, thank you.

116
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,140
I'm so happy to see that you're playing Epic Mickey today.

117
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,180
The original is one of my favorite games ever.

118
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,240
Thank you for the Super Chat.

119
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,160
Thank you, thank you.

120
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,780
Brian, thank you for the super chat.

121
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,100
Thank you.

122
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:09,740
Thank you.

123
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:10,800
Hi, Doki.

124
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,880
I just realized you could combo canteen swear words in pretty much any order and it still makes sense.

125
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,060
It makes me so proud.

126
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,060
Thank you for the super chat.

127
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,360
Thank you.

128
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,040
Thank you.

129
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,180
Peter, thank you for the super chat.

130
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:20,480
Thank you.

131
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,020
Thank you.

132
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,380
I mean, WoW follows up from the stories from Warcraft 3.

133
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,020
Warcraft 3 is all wrapped up by Wrath of the Lich King.

134
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:27,860
Thank you for the super chat.

135
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,180
Thank you.

136
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:28,800
Thank you.

137
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:33,440
Yeah, I never got a chance to play Wii sports at all when I was growing up.

138
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,220
So I never had that privilege slash opportunity because my dad was like, Nintendo's for babies.

139
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,040
So I never got a chance to play.

140
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,580
It was only, I think, my first Nintendo console.

141
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:49,500
I don't count like Game Boys or like handheld consoles, but my dad did let me get like handheld console.

142
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,260
But my very first like Nintendo console was the GameCube.

143
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,380
But even then, it was like at the end of its lifespan.

144
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,240
It was as a birthday present to me.

145
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,880
Like my dad got it for me as a birthday present.

146
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,260
So I only owned like three games on the GameCube because like they weren't making any new games after that.

147
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:11,600
And then like literally the year that the GameCube died was when my dad got me the GameCube.

148
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:18,100
And then the next time I was able to get another Nintendo console was the Wii U, which was also for my birthday.

149
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,080
Which was also for my birthday.

150
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,460
So those were the two Nintendo consoles I was able to get.

151
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:33,240
And finally, I could get a Switch because I bought it for myself.

152
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:33,620
Yay!

153
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,120
Yabby, thank you for the Super Chat.

154
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,100
Thank you, thank you.

155
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,200
Have you seen Grok's VTuber model?

156
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:42,600
Yes!

157
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,080
I was gonna talk about that.

158
00:10:44,280 --> 00:11:01,320
There was a video I saw that popped up where if you, um, I did not realize that there was a subscription based The first thing on Twitter, where you can subscribe to, you know, like, Twitter Blue, all that shit, well, apparently there's a tier that you can subscribe to,

159
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:09,320
which is, like, you know, the highest, the most expensive one, where it's, like, you get super Grok, and I was like, they're super Grok?

160
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:13,520
And then you can basically, it's basically a VTuber, so...

161
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,980
It's like an AI VTuber.

162
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:31,260
So, if you talk to her enough, so Grok basically becomes your anime waifu, your anime 3D waifu, and if you talk to her enough and give her enough attention, she will put lingerie for you.

163
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:40,750
And I was like, excuse me, giving the people what they want.

164
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:50,610
So, yes, so if you talk to her enough, uh, you will, like, she will put on lingerie.

165
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:58,930
And then a friend linked me this video called, sexting Grok, how is this supposed to prevent population collapse?

166
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:05,310
And, okay, I'll play the video for you.

167
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,670
I'll let you guys listen to the video.

168
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:10,750
But I won't put it up because I didn't have a chance to.

169
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,790
Tell me what you...

170
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:11,790
Okay.

171
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:16,310
I want you to look at my ass and tell me what you do to it.

172
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,310
Oodle

173
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,300
tease.

174
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:31,570
It's while pulling you close for some

175
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:36,820
serious...

176
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,260
Dookie, stop!

177
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,900
Oh, that's...

178
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,940
That's Grok, by the way.

179
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,400
That's super Grok.

180
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,300
That's...

181
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,080
What the actual...

182
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:52,340
I mean, yeah, I stopped at a good area.

183
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:57,720
Look, all she said was, all super Grok said was that she'll give you a smack.

184
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,620
What do you mean I need help?

185
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,400
This is not what I did!

186
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,100
I didn't even...

187
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,800
I didn't even do this!

188
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,740
I mean, that was on Twitter's thought!

189
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,560
Twitter did this!

190
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,620
What did I do?

191
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:18,340
I'm just showing you a new update to the technology we have today.

192
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm just...

193
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,240
You exposed us.

194
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,500
I did this.

195
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:27,120
I'm just showing you the wonders of technology now.

196
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,780
Zero, thank you for the super chat.

197
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:33,200
Thank you.

198
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:33,880
Thank you.

199
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,360
I think Purple Lamp did amazing with this remastered.

200
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,200
Glad to see you playing this.

201
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:38,760
Hope you had fun.

202
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,160
Thank you.

203
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:39,640
Thank you for the...

204
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,460
I like on my Disney game, too.

205
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,600
On my...

206
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,120
Toki, how could you...

207
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,380
How could you do this on my epic Mickey playthrough?

208
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,680
Brian, thank you for the super chat.

209
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:53,980
Thank you.

210
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:54,660
Thank you, chat.

211
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,960
Is this safe for YouTube?

212
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,880
Gus, thank you for the super chat.

213
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,160
Thank you.

214
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:58,560
Thank you.

215
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,480
And now the VOD is 18+.

216
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,040
Nexi, thank you for the super chat.

217
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:04,420
Thank you.

218
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:04,960
Thank you.

219
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,540
I guess it's my fault for listening to Toki at work.

220
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,680
But what on earth is this?

221
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,280
You can...

222
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,180
You can...

223
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:19,340
You too can talk to Super Grok and have her put on a lingerie and have the wildest fantasies.

224
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,960
You know what's crazy?

225
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:26,100
I like how Super Grok came out during...

226
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:31,800
Apparently a document recently came out today as well talking about how...

227
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,040
How at our current rate, we will...

228
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:44,120
The human race will experience global extinction at the current pace we're doing because we're not having enough babies.

229
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,200
And then Super Grok came out.

230
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,240
Um...

231
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,440
Um...

232
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,020
I...

233
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:53,800
I...

234
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:53,920
I...

235
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,580
I...

236
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,120
Guys...

237
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,820
At Grok, do you think this will help us?

238
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:58,480
Uh...

239
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,840
We deserve it.

240
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,100
Um...

241
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:03,520
More falls.

242
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,940
Thank you for the super chat.

243
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,420
Thank you.

244
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,200
Thank you.

245
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:07,860
Um...

246
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,720
Future Doki.

247
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,060
Guys, I got demonetized.

248
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,660
We kind of deserve it.

249
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,460
Um...

250
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:29,660
Anyway...

251
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,760
Okay, before I play Epic Mickey, um...

252
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:32,980
I...

253
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:33,520
Oh my gosh.

254
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,580
I actually introduced, uh...

255
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:39,000
One of my friends to Kingdom Hearts recently.

256
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,060
Um...

257
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:40,900
Because they never...

258
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,060
They never grew up with Kingdom Hearts and they never played Kingdom Hearts before.

259
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,760
And I was like, oh my gosh, you should try out Kingdom Hearts.

260
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,460
I was like, oh...

261
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,200
I was like thinking about it.

262
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,220
I was like, wait, you never played Kingdom Hearts before?

263
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,660
Because one of my friends was like asking what my...

264
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,300
What kind of game series I'm planning on playing next.

265
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,620
And I was like, oh, I want to play...

266
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,260
Uh...

267
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,300
I won't play Kingdom Hearts one day, but it's so long.

268
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,680
So I'm gonna wait until later when I actually have time to do that on my channel.

269
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:10,420
And when I stop caring about the algorithm because of how long the games are.

270
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:17,500
When it least hurts my algorithm, I will play Kingdom Hearts.

271
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,360
Anyway, so my friend was like, oh yeah, I'll try it out.

272
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,260
Like, I had never grew up with Kingdom Hearts before.

273
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:34,060
Oh yeah, by the way, like I'm saying that, but apparently a new Madoka game is releasing on Steam this week.

274
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:34,940
And I want to play it.

275
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,180
But it's like, I was like, oh shit, a new Madoka game?

276
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,500
And I read it, it was like RPG, JRPG.

277
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,940
And I was like, oh fuck, okay, should I kill my channel next week?

278
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:46,780
Or...

279
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,860
I was just like, oh shit, but I love her so much.

280
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,140
I love... I'll do it for her.

281
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,960
It doesn't, it doesn't seem like that.

282
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,200
It just says it's an RPG.

283
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:01,980
Is it Gacha?

284
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,980
I don't know, it's on Steam.

285
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,420
I'll do it for her.

286
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,820
Okay, anyway.

287
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,040
Oh, it's Gacha?

288
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,720
I thought it was an RPG.

289
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,460
Are you serious?

290
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,740
Oh my god, it tricked me.

291
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,160
It says dive into...

292
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,780
Okay, it was like, dive into the 3D world of Madoka Magica.

293
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,880
Featuring an all new story setting.

294
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,360
Experience the action alongside magical girl memories in this battle RPG.

295
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,460
I can't believe it.

296
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,480
It tricked me.

297
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:41,560
It didn't say anything about Gacha on the Steam page.

298
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,720
I can't believe it.

299
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,640
I'm so sad.

300
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,620
It seemed like it was...

301
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:56,040
It was a non-Gacha game.

302
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,300
The Gacha RPG.

303
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,460
That's fucked up.

304
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,880
I was gonna do it for her.

305
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,960
I didn't realize.

306
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,900
But if it's like, if the memory...

307
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,860
If the fucking story is Gacha luck, then fuck that shit.

308
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,260
Because that's how they're gonna get me.

309
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,980
That's how they're gonna get me.

310
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,600
They know.

311
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,180
They fucking know.

312
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:20,620
Anyway.

313
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:26,700
Because I would spend money if I got into that not knowing it's Gacha.

314
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,640
I would have spent money just for her.

315
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:32,800
Anyway.

316
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,040
Anyway, so...

317
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:40,020
I watched a bit of my friend playing Kingdom Hearts.

318
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:40,760
Because I was...

319
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:45,040
Because for me, it actually has been years since I played Kingdom Hearts 1.

320
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,860
The last time I played it was when...

321
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,580
During around the time the game was released.

322
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,180
Maybe a year or something into the release or something.

323
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,300
I don't remember.

324
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,040
I just...

325
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,000
A year or two.

326
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,900
I don't remember.

327
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:00,820
I don't even know.

328
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,800
Wait, when did it release?

329
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,540
I just know that when I played it...

330
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,620
I never...

331
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,820
I remember I never finished it.

332
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,680
And then like a couple...

333
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,400
Because I got...

334
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,800
Because I don't read the game.

335
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,840
I don't read a lot.

336
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:14,840
I don't even know how the fuck I was able to get that far playing the game at that age I was.

337
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,380
But I got stuck on it for the longest time.

338
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,900
I remember because there was an area in the beginning.

339
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,480
Okay, this is like a huge moment in my memory.

340
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:33,140
Because I remember I spent like several days stuck in Traverse Town.

341
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,320
Oh, it was like Traverse Town where you're supposed to like walk...

342
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,520
Try to find Leon and the girl that dies.

343
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,620
What's her name?

344
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,980
In the sewers or some shit?

345
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,300
And I didn't realize that's...

346
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,700
Sorry, Aerith.

347
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:53,880
Yeah.

348
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,420
Yeah, her.

349
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,620
Aerith or whatever her name is.

350
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,420
So...

351
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:06,380
And I remember this moment because I was stuck there for like days.

352
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,920
Because I didn't realize you're supposed to do that dumbass fucking Trinity Mark or some shit.

353
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,440
To unlock the sewers.

354
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,360
And I kept running around that stupid ass town.

355
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,140
Trying to figure out where the fuck to go.

356
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,560
Because I had no concept of anything.

357
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,880
Because I don't read.

358
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,720
Obviously, I read a little bit now.

359
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,780
But back then, I actually did not read.

360
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,800
Because that has happened to me multiple times in multiple games.

361
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,180
And then I...

362
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:33,560
After I got through that, I got stuck on...

363
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,000
What...

364
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,840
Which one was it?

365
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,620
I got stuck on the aerial map.

366
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,180
Because fuck that map too.

367
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,940
Because I also did not know where to go.

368
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,780
And I was so fucking lost.

369
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,560
And fuck the swim...

370
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,580
Fuck any maps that require you to be underwater and swimming.

371
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:57,480
And then after that, I got stuck again on the Hollow Bastion map.

372
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,640
When we were trying to do the book stuff.

373
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,520
So I didn't realize...

374
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:02,900
Um...

375
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,940
Um...

376
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,100
I was trying to...

377
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,540
You have to like rearrange the books in the library.

378
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,200
And like put all the books in the order.

379
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:17,180
And I couldn't find the last fucking book that was on the goddamn desk.

380
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,280
And that...

381
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,340
And I gave up.

382
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,480
And I never...

383
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,280
And then I stopped...

384
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,100
I stopped playing the game at that point.

385
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,740
Because I couldn't find the books for the library.

386
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:34,320
That was the last book that was on the goddamn desk.

387
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,240
Because I...

388
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:35,560
You know...

389
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,120
My child brain...

390
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,260
Uh...

391
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,120
Didn't realize that like...

392
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,280
The book was on the desk.

393
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:41,900
Because I thought...

394
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,680
Oh, all the books are on the other bookshelves.

395
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,820
And then I stopped playing Kingdom Hearts 1.

396
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,940
Never finished the game.

397
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,180
And I think like...

398
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,760
Five years later...

399
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,480
Um...

400
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,660
I picked up the game again.

401
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,140
I was like...

402
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:52,760
Because I don't remember.

403
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,640
Whenever Kingdom Hearts 2 came out.

404
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,680
I was like...

405
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,820
I'm gonna beat Kingdom Hearts...

406
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,300
Actually, no.

407
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:58,480
No.

408
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:58,980
Actually, no.

409
00:21:59,060 --> 00:21:59,580
That's a lie.

410
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,800
Because Kingdom Hearts 2 took a long fucking time to come out.

411
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,000
And I was...

412
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,400
Um...

413
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:05,940
And like...

414
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,240
I remember playing Kingdom Hearts 2.

415
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,380
When I moved to Asia.

416
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,320
So like...

417
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,600
I was still in Canada when I finished Kingdom Hearts 1.

418
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,460
And so...

419
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,040
Uh...

420
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,580
So...

421
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,460
I think it was like...

422
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,020
Five years later...

423
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,400
Um...

424
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,340
I was like...

425
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:21,960
I'm gonna...

426
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,440
I...

427
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:23,600
I...

428
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,920
Found the box of Kingdom Hearts 1.

429
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:26,920
And I was like...

430
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,300
I'm gonna finish that game.

431
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,960
And then like...

432
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,960
I opened the box.

433
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,660
And the disc was not in that box.

434
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,820
Because back then...

435
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,180
I was a little shithead.

436
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,040
And I put the disc in like...

437
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,220
Whatever box I feel like.

438
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,660
So I don't know where...

439
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,760
Any of the original...

440
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,700
I couldn't find...

441
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,620
The original disc...

442
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,040
Of Kingdom Hearts 1.

443
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,360
Because...

444
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,720
I opened the box.

445
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,520
And it wasn't Kingdom Hearts 1.

446
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,700
I was like...

447
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,000
Oh fuck.

448
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,380
I guess I'm not gonna try and beat this game.

449
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,380
And...

450
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:00,620
Um...

451
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,540
And then...

452
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,040
So...

453
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,160
Yeah, I was one of those people.

454
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,580
Like all my discs were on...

455
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,480
In different boxes.

456
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,660
So then I was like...

457
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,020
Oh shit.

458
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:07,320
Okay.

459
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,360
Um...

460
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,220
And then I was like...

461
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,780
Dad, can I find another Kingdom Hearts?

462
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,120
So...

463
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:17,160
So...

464
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,220
My dad bought me another copy of Kingdom Hearts 1.

465
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,920
Because I couldn't find the disc anymore.

466
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,380
And so...

467
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,400
So I got another copy of Kingdom Hearts 1.

468
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,340
And then five years later...

469
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,700
After Little Doki...

470
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,180
Little Doki...

471
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:32,660
Uh...

472
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,680
Couldn't beat...

473
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,900
The game...

474
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,700
Because she was stuck on the library level.

475
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,540
Little Doki...

476
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:38,880
Um...

477
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,860
Replayed the entire game.

478
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,240
Because she already forgot like...

479
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,240
She forgot like...

480
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,260
The entire story...

481
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,340
Of the first Kingdom...

482
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,340
Of Kingdom Hearts.

483
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,180
So I was like...

484
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,560
I might as well start in the beginning.

485
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,420
Because I don't fucking remember what I was doing.

486
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:51,440
And...

487
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,980
And finally managed to beat Kingdom Hearts 1.

488
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,540
After so many years.

489
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,280
And...

490
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:02,980
Anyway...

491
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,520
So speaking of Kingdom Hearts...

492
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,440
I was watching my friend play like...

493
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,040
The beginning of Kingdom Hearts.

494
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,760
A little bit.

495
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,940
Because I was like...

496
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,180
You know...

497
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:10,340
I was like...

498
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,800
Oh it's been so long since like...

499
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,600
I played this game.

500
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,260
Like...

501
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,360
And then I realized...

502
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,600
Watching my friend play...

503
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,560
The beginning of it.

504
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,240
I was like...

505
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,700
It made me realize...

506
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,420
That Kingdom Hearts 1...

507
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,380
I'm sorry.

508
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,240
I don't know if this is a hot take.

509
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,260
But...

510
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,960
Kingdom Hearts 1...

511
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,700
Was so fucking mid.

512
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,740
Compared to like...

513
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,360
The other...

514
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,080
Like...

515
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:31,640
Because like...

516
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,420
Kingdom Hearts 2 was so good.

517
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,360
Because I...

518
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,060
I have much more fonder memories...

519
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,020
Of Kingdom Hearts 2.

520
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,720
But Kingdom Hearts 1...

521
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,120
Was so fucking mid.

522
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:40,800
I'm...

523
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,420
I was like...

524
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,620
Holy shit.

525
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:47,820
The...

526
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,960
The boss mechanics...

527
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,980
Some of the boss's mechanics...

528
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,700
Were...

529
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,720
Were like...

530
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,960
So bullshit.

531
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:55,780
Like...

532
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,280
The earth...

533
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:56,580
Like...

534
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,220
Oh my gosh.

535
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,000
Because I was like...

536
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,480
Oh my god.

537
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,540
Was it really that mid?

538
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,200
So then I looked up like...

539
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:01,780
The fight...

540
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,600
Boss fights...

541
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,340
Later on.

542
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:03,960
Yeah.

543
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,260
It's very clunky.

544
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,060
It looked very clunky to control.

545
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:07,680
I was like...

546
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,360
Jesus Christ.

547
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,600
The hit rank...

548
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,680
The hit rank...

549
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,300
Was like...

550
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,020
Pretty bad.

551
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,320
And it's like...

552
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,920
Control seemed very clunky.

553
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,200
And...

554
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,980
And then like...

555
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,680
I looked up like...

556
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,240
Some of the boss fight mechanics.

557
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:24,820
I was like...

558
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:24,980
Wait.

559
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,020
Was it really this mid?

560
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:26,560
Has that...

561
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,120
Have I just been fueled by nostalgia...

562
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,140
This entire time?

563
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,480
And then...

564
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,620
And then I looked up...

565
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,160
And I was like...

566
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:33,740
Holy fuck.

567
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,640
The Ursula boss fight...

568
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,120
I was like...

569
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:36,580
Oh my god.

570
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,160
I repressed my memories of the Ursula boss fight.

571
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,220
Because I forgot how fucking bullshit...

572
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,320
Some of these boss fights were.

573
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,480
Because I was like...

574
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,180
I was like re-watching the Ursula fight.

575
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:46,740
And I was like...

576
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,500
Holy shit.

577
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,960
That boss fight...

578
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,020
Fucking sucks.

579
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,700
It was good for the time.

580
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,760
I was like...

581
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,900
Oh my god.

582
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,400
Yeah.

583
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,280
That world...

584
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,080
In general...

585
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,280
What is it?

586
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:02,800
I know...

587
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,600
I remember that world being a fucking chore.

588
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,420
Because I had no idea...

589
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,960
I remember, like, little... little or me did not know where to go.

590
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:15,820
And, yeah, and, like, because I was just like, oh my god, what the fuck?

591
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,060
I can't... I... oh my god.

592
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,660
Like, we all had to start somewhere, you know?

593
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,500
We all had to start somewhere.

594
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,760
Yeah, some of the parts did not age well.

595
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:33,180
And then, like, I had to look at a tutorial for my friend, because my friend was like, where the fuck do I go?

596
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:50,940
Like, in Traverstown, because you're supposed to go at a set direction of doors in Traverstown to, like, set off the cutscenes with Donald and Goofy, so you can fucking get to the final cutscene where you... you fight a boss.

597
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:57,080
And I was... and then, like, because, like, they were, like, stuck in Traverstown for, like, 30 plus minutes.

598
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,540
And then I'm like, bro, can you, like, fucking progress?

599
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:03,500
And I was like, and then... and then they were like, I don't know where to go!

600
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,460
I've been fighting in the same...

601
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:21,650
And then I was... yeah, I was backseating.

602
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,530
Yeah, I was like, bro, streamer!

603
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:24,270
Streamer!

604
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:26,250
Fucking progress the game, streamer!

605
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:33,750
Yeah, um, uh, so I was just, like, reading...

606
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:36,230
I had to, like, read the tutorial out for them.

607
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:45,230
And I was like, okay, you go through these doors, and then you go through these doors, and then, from that, you'll trigger these cutscenes, and...

608
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:51,370
And then there's, like, one part where you're like, okay, go to Sid when you're back in Traverstown.

609
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:57,130
Um, make sure you talk to Merlin, and then he's gonna tell you about the book.

610
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:02,790
And then, and then, you have to go into the sewers, and then talk to Leon and the girl that dies.

611
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:08,810
And then, then, you go back to Sid, you talk to Sid, and then you go back to Merlin, you talk to him again.

612
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:12,270
And then you go back outside of Sid, and then...

613
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:18,110
And then I'm like thinking, I was like, how the fuck did little me figure this out?

614
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,990
I just was like, I don't know.

615
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:23,470
I don't know how I figured this out when I was like tiny.

616
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,110
I was like, oh my god.

617
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:27,310
There's so many things.

618
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:29,130
It's not self-explanatory.

619
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:34,990
I swear to god, it was not self-explanatory because they're like, what do I do?

620
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,330
And I was like, I don't fucking know.

621
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:37,650
I don't remember.

622
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:42,250
It's been like so 15 plus years since I played Kingdom Hearts.

623
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,970
Tiny Doki noticed things.

624
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:54,230
Clearly, Tiny Doki noticed things a lot more than like, current Doki.

625
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:03,830
Anyway, I'm super excited to... Oh my gosh, it's been 30.

626
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:05,110
Sorry, I've been yapping for 30 minutes.

627
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:08,390
I'm sorry for everyone's like, streamer, where is Epic Mickey?

628
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:14,370
But anyway, speaking of that, I cannot wait to try out Epic Mickey.

629
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:17,460
Maybe like, current Doki will be able to...

630
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:23,710
Will be able to like, figure this out easier than Kingdom Hearts.

631
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:28,670
But yeah, this was a couple of days ago when I introduced Kingdom Hearts to my friend.

632
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:37,110
And they apparently, they've like, hit the... I don't know if it's Stockholm Syndrome, but like, I think they beat the game already.

633
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:37,910
I'm not sure.

634
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:40,410
Because like, I think like, I asked them today.

635
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:42,030
I was like, how are you enjoying Kingdom Hearts?

636
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:42,930
And they're like, oh, yeah.

637
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:45,590
Oh, I've been actually really liking Kingdom Hearts.

638
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:48,390
I've been watching the, like, lore videos and stuff.

639
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:52,070
And I'm like... And I was like, bro, what?

640
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:56,950
No, I was like, bro, you don't have to watch the lore videos.

641
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:57,710
Like, we don't...

642
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,570
We don't even understand the lore.

643
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:05,510
But they're like, oh, I've actually been liking Kingdom Hearts a lot.

644
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:10,090
Like, I can't... I heard... Everyone was saying Kingdom Hearts 2 is like, the best one.

645
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:12,570
So I can't wait to try out Kingdom Hearts 2.

646
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:14,510
And, um...

647
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:15,910
Um...

648
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:16,550
And...

649
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,910
And then I was like, oh...

650
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,750
At least they're liking it now, you know?

651
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:25,630
Because the beginning... Me... When I was watching my friend play the beginning part, they were like...

652
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:27,390
They were like, I hate this.

653
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:33,390
So I was like...

654
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:34,210
Um...

655
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:37,810
So I'm glad that, like, they actually are enjoying Kingdom Hearts now.

656
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:40,470
And that they're looking forward to trying out too.

657
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:43,710
And then, also, they're playing it on proud mode.

658
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,510
So, like, the hardest difficulty.

659
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:47,970
And I was like, bro, I never even played it on the hard...

660
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:51,150
Because I felt like, the hardest difficulty is so bullshit.

661
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:52,250
Um...

662
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,290
And I was like, are you sure?

663
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:54,870
You've never played Kingdom Hearts before?

664
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:57,830
But basically, they're playing on the hardest difficulty too.

665
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,050
Um...

666
00:30:59,050 --> 00:30:59,390
Funny story.

667
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:00,690
They...

668
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:03,150
Accidentally put on zero EXP...

669
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,330
I didn't realize this was a thing.

670
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:08,650
But in proud difficulty, there's a thing called zero EXP share.

671
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:11,210
And they were on that till...

672
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:13,670
Apparently, they accidentally had that on.

673
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:16,170
All the way till...

674
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:17,750
Tarzan world, apparently.

675
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:20,510
And then, like, my friend told me about it.

676
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,990
It was like, this is why I was getting two shot by everything.

677
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:26,230
And they had to, like, redo the entire...

678
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:29,030
They had to do everything again.

679
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:30,530
Because they were...

680
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:32,350
They were only level six...

681
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:35,070
They've been level six for, like, three hours.

682
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:35,990
They...

683
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,390
Also, I...

684
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:41,270
I told them...

685
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,930
Because my friend was like, oh, I love challenges.

686
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,110
And I was like, okay.

687
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:47,130
But, like, some of the bosses are, like, very bullshit.

688
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:53,570
But, like, because my friend was like, oh, I love, like, some of the how...

689
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:55,790
The challenge of beating these hard bosses.

690
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:56,950
And I was like, you don't understand.

691
00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:00,230
No, Kingdom Hearts bosses are very, very bullshit.

692
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:04,070
And, like, sometimes you're not even meant to, like, beat them.

693
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:04,770
Like, they're...

694
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:09,410
Like, there's, like, you only have, like, one frame to beat these bosses.

695
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:11,490
And then they're like, no, you're...

696
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:12,730
You can't be fucking with me.

697
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:13,170
That's not true.

698
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:13,790
And that...

699
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,390
There's this video...

700
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:18,610
That, like, lives rent-free in my head.

701
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:20,390
Um...

702
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:22,630
And, like, I always think about that...

703
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:23,130
This video.

704
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:24,470
Because it's so, like...

705
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:25,810
It's so fucking funny.

706
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:30,490
And it, like, showcases how bullshit Kingdom Hearts bosses are.

707
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:32,490
And I'll link you guys the...

708
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:34,350
I'll link you guys to the video.

709
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:34,990
I...

710
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:40,470
No, it's not Kingdom Hearts 1.

711
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:41,410
It's, like...

712
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:42,570
Bro, I think this is, like...

713
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:44,010
The one with, like, Ventus.

714
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,430
This is my favorite video.

715
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:48,530
Okay, wait.

716
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,230
I'll let you guys listen to the audio, too.

717
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,000
No shot you're meant to win this fight.

718
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,840
It's supposed to be a fucking RPG.

719
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,860
What role am I playing?

720
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,940
The fucking victim?

721
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:03,620
Jesus!

722
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:09,250
No.

723
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:10,790
I love...

724
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:14,150
I love that video so much!

725
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:15,750
Okay.

726
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,230
What...

727
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,310
What fucking role am I playing?

728
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:22,270
The fucking victim?

729
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,970
I can't...

730
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:27,250
Yeah.

731
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:28,950
I can't...

732
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:29,550
I...

733
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,250
I can't...

734
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:31,450
It's actually...

735
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:32,490
It's so good.

736
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,150
I love this.

737
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,910
I love this video.

738
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:36,670
Yeah.

739
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:41,270
I don't want to... I don't want to the video game.

740
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:43,930
It's supposed to be a fucking RPG.

741
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:45,950
What role am I playing?

742
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:47,010
The fucking victim?

743
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:49,230
Jesus fucking Christ.

744
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:56,410
I don't wait until he fucking... he's just dead.

745
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:59,010
He's just dead.

746
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:02,390
Blake, thank you for the super chat.

747
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,750
Thank you, thank you.

748
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:08,470
I'll be honest, I noped right out of Kingdom Hearts 1 and watched the vids of the story.

749
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,170
I hated the camera in it.

750
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:12,010
Oh yeah, you can now change the camera.

751
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:14,250
You can change the camera to like manual movement.

752
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,630
So you don't have to worry about it anymore.

753
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:18,930
Thank you for the super chat.

754
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:19,730
Thank you, thank you.

755
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:21,770
Alright, now, now we play Epic Mickey.

756
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:24,790
Sorry, we had a lot of disaster today in the beginning.

757
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:27,270
But now, now it's Epic Mickey time.

758
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,830
I'm booting it up.

759
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:34,670
To be fair, the unknown is an optional post game boss.

760
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:35,890
I think it was super chat next to you.

761
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:36,830
Thank you, thank you.

762
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,570
Yeah, yeah, I know that.

763
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,270
But like, my friend was like, I want to kill all the bosses.

764
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:43,290
Like, because like, they're like a completionist and stuff.

765
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:44,230
And I was like, oh, are you sure?

766
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:45,110
Are you sure though?

767
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,630
Because some of these bosses are...

768
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:49,890
The secret bosses are tend to be incredibly bullshit.

769
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:56,090
Like, they are meant to be incredibly hard to fight.

770
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:00,030
Alright, let's see.

771
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:02,730
Alright, I'm booting up.

772
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:04,590
I'm booting up Epic Mickey.

773
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:09,390
And it's installing a Microsoft VC redistributable.

774
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:11,790
Oh, I thought I installed everything.

775
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:12,590
I didn't realize.

776
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,270
Oh, I should have booted up before.

777
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,970
I'm prepping before stream.

778
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:17,590
Hee hee.

779
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,550
I respect the dedication.

780
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:25,270
I like how someone was like, I know what you are.

781
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:26,190
Hee hee hee.

782
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,050
Hee hee hee.

783
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:27,550
Hee hee hee.

784
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:29,590
Hee hee hee.

785
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,390
D-Dragon, thank you for the super chat.

786
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:32,470
Thank you, thank you.

787
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,190
Playing devil's advocate here.

788
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:37,590
The movement in Birth by Sleep is shit compared to the first Kingdom Hearts.

789
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:38,310
Especially 2.

790
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:39,230
Thank you for the super chat.

791
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:40,130
Thank you, thank you.

792
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,170
I've never...

793
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:41,390
Okay.

794
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:44,270
I played Kingdom Hearts 1, 2.

795
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,830
The console version of Chain by Memories.

796
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:49,070
When they like ported it.

797
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:50,750
When they ported it to console.

798
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:54,090
And 365 slash 2 days.

799
00:35:56,230 --> 00:36:00,430
And a little bit of Dream Drop Distance.

800
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:01,950
Because like...

801
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,110
Tron was in there.

802
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:05,170
So I really wanted to play...

803
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:07,030
I really wanted to play...

804
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,210
Dream Drop Distance.

805
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,630
I beat the Tron world.

806
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:12,030
And then I stopped playing it.

807
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:14,990
It's not good.

808
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,590
Triple D's...

809
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,610
Was not good.

810
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,890
I stopped after I beat Tron world.

811
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,130
Because it was pretty bad.

812
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:27,530
But...

813
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:30,330
Birth by Sleep was actually the one I didn't play.

814
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:31,630
Because like...

815
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:34,170
I think I was like...

816
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,330
I was like an asshole kid.

817
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:37,510
Who was like...

818
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:38,730
Where's Sora?

819
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:40,910
Where's...

820
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,510
Where's Roxas?

821
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:43,810
Ventus?

822
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:45,290
Who the fuck is Ventus?

823
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:47,850
I wanted to play Sora and Roxas.

824
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:52,390
I was like...

825
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:53,630
I was like...

826
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:57,130
Who are these three characters?

827
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:00,910
I won...

828
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:03,570
I won my main characters.

829
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:04,950
And then I...

830
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:05,970
I didn't play it.

831
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:06,690
I...

832
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,730
I didn't play it.

833
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:11,690
Because I was like...

834
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:12,090
Not...

835
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:13,090
Not my...

836
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:13,850
Not my Sora.

837
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,530
Not my Roxas.

838
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:18,290
So I never actually played...

839
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:20,150
Birth by Sleep.

840
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,560
Alright.

841
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,320
Yay!

842
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,100
Alright, Sound Guy.

843
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:30,900
This is...

844
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,680
It's time for it to do your job.

845
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,920
But I don't...

846
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,400
Oh, purple lamp.

847
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:55,790
Oh boy!

848
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,910
Spicy, welcome to Tamiya Farm.

849
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:00,650
Welcome, welcome.

850
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:09,210
I miss when Mickey...

851
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:11,770
They were able to make Mickey a little shithead.

852
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,090
Because like...

853
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:16,170
He's too like...

854
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:17,730
He's too tame now.

855
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,350
Because now he's like an actual...

856
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:20,250
Like just a mascot.

857
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:24,510
I miss when he was just a little shithead.

858
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:26,770
Like...

859
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:28,910
Like OG Mickey was an asshole.

860
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:29,730
And I loved it.

861
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,990
Because at least he has a fucking personality.

862
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:37,330
He lost his Shang.

863
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:41,110
I was putting the finishing touches on my latest creation.

864
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:45,730
A world for things that have been forgotten.

865
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:47,750
Whoa!

866
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:52,230
Oh

867
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,180
my god.

868
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,180
The Sorcerer's Apprentice song.

869
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,520
Satisfied with my progress.

870
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,060
I put the magic brush down.

871
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,520
And retired.

872
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:11,060
Also suggesting Kingdom Hearts to my friend was like...

873
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,940
I was like...

874
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,780
I should never have suggested Kingdom Hearts to my friend.

875
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,720
Because my friend has never actually watched Disney movies.

876
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,040
Because I was like...

877
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,260
I was like...

878
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:20,380
Oh!

879
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,400
It's that character!

880
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,180
And he's like...

881
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:22,420
Who?

882
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,460
And I was like...

883
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,700
Are you fucking kidding me?

884
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,360
Like...

885
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,260
They've never watched Aladdin?

886
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:30,820
Cinderella?

887
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,220
Like all the...

888
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:32,740
Like...

889
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:35,200
It was like only one movie that they watched.

890
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:36,440
Um...

891
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,200
In the...

892
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,560
That were in Kingdom Hearts 1.

893
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,160
I was like...

894
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:41,680
What's the point?

895
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:47,620
They knew more about the Final Fantasy characters than the Kingdom Hearts characters.

896
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,420
How young are they?

897
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:58,780
Like...

898
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,180
Like...

899
00:39:59,180 --> 00:39:59,400
See?

900
00:39:59,520 --> 00:39:59,720
I...

901
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,880
I literally recognize the Sorcerer's Apprentice music.

902
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:04,680
And everything.

903
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,220
This game was made for me!

904
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,040
That's right, Mickey!

905
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,680
Destroy the world, you little asshole!

906
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:20,560
Your lawyers will...

907
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,160
Your lawyers will save you!

908
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:28,340
Okay, but how does this game connect to Kingdom Hearts lore?

909
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,820
Wow, they give us a super chat!

910
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:30,160
Thank you!

911
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:30,760
Thank you!

912
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:34,660
Oh no!

913
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,920
It's alright, Mickey has his lawyers.

914
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,520
The mysterious intruder was gone.

915
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,260
I did not learn his identity.

916
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,560
Well...

917
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,140
Not for a very long time.

918
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,200
Oh my god, and then he became famous!

919
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,040
Ah!

920
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:52,160
Ah!

921
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,240
Is that Christopher Lee as Yen Sid again?

922
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,580
It could be!

923
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,520
He hasn't...

924
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,000
He was still alive back then.

925
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,380
Sorry, too soon?

926
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:19,230
Oh boy!

927
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:22,870
No!

928
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:43,230
Technically, he's his father, you think about it.

929
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,540
The Ink Monster's dad?

930
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,260
He did create him.

931
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:01,250
I know but I don't...

932
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:01,510
I know but I don't...

933
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:03,570
Um...

934
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:05,970
I miss when Disney music was like...

935
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:07,090
Good...

936
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:08,030
Back then.

937
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:09,250
I feel like...

938
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:10,530
I don't know...

939
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:12,290
Disney music now is like...

940
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,210
Not as good these days.

941
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:15,210
It's not memorable.

942
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:19,370
Do you love me, father?

943
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:20,230
Do you love me, father?

944
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:25,130
Oh?

945
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:26,930
What's going on?

946
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:28,810
Who's he?

947
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:31,250
Oh, it's Oswald!

948
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:35,430
I found out that...

949
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:36,270
Um...

950
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:38,230
Because like Universal owned Oswald.

951
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:42,390
And this was like the first time they did anything with Oswald since getting back the rights for him.

952
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:48,130
And like Disney traded like an actual human being to get the rights for Oswald.

953
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:48,670
Like...

954
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:53,570
Like some fucking NPC like host.

955
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:57,910
They're like, we'll give you this NPC host if you give us Oswald.

956
00:42:58,730 --> 00:42:59,350
Like...

957
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:00,030
Yeah!

958
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:02,490
Yeah!

959
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:02,530
Yeah!

960
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:03,770
Or the ESPN?

961
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:04,370
Oh, sorry.

962
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:05,810
It was an ESPN host.

963
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:06,610
What?

964
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:07,010
Yeah.

965
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:09,910
Yeah, they're like, you can have the sport caster.

966
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:10,970
And then we...

967
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:11,810
And we'll...

968
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:13,950
Yeah, they traded him.

969
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:14,510
Like...

970
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:15,650
It was like some sport.

971
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:19,970
A trade offer.

972
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:21,110
We get Oswald.

973
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:23,050
And you get ESPN.

974
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:26,470
Oh, shit.

975
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:28,190
Is that how you take the heart?

976
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:44,250
The Oswald draft.

977
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:44,910
Yeah!

978
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:48,750
It would be a trade offer.

979
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:54,770
That's right.

980
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:58,130
Just like my Kingdom Hearts.

981
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:07,930
How's the sound so far, sound guy?

982
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:22,140
Oh!

983
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,520
Wait, sound guy alive?

984
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:39,310
Alright.

985
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:42,290
I could use more sound effects than Mickey.

986
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:43,850
Oh, it's Gus!

987
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:45,970
It's from those animated shorts.

988
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:47,090
The old ones.

989
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:51,960
Hmm.

990
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,080
Over here, Mickey.

991
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,440
I remember them.

992
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:57,340
He's from the old animated shorts.

993
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:03,670
Oh, shit.

994
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:04,670
Is that a real eye?

995
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:06,190
Oh, no.

996
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:06,610
It's me.

997
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:07,470
Oh, boy.

998
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:11,930
Never heard of him?

999
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:12,250
Oh, yeah.

1000
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:13,190
He's like old, old.

1001
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:14,090
Oh, yeah.

1002
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:14,330
Wait.

1003
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:16,470
Not found.

1004
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:17,170
I paid...

1005
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:17,630
Okay, there you go.

1006
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:18,490
Yes!

1007
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:19,690
Guys, I paid for this.

1008
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:23,230
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

1009
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:24,770
I won't be Brave Little Taylor.

1010
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:28,030
Actually, this is one of my favorite Mickey shorts.

1011
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:31,670
Yeah, I got the costumes.

1012
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:34,630
This is my favorite Mickey episodes.

1013
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:41,170
Yeah, I got Team Boat, Willy, Brave Little Taylor, and football.

1014
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:43,510
I actually don't know where this one comes from.

1015
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:44,930
The football one comes from.

1016
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:46,610
Pure Mickey.

1017
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:48,630
Mickey in his purest form.

1018
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:50,470
Um...

1019
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:51,910
Let's see it.

1020
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:53,410
Let's do the options real quick.

1021
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:54,230
Photo mode.

1022
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:55,210
Okay, game setting.

1023
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:56,370
Audio.

1024
00:45:58,350 --> 00:45:58,830
Uh...

1025
00:45:58,830 --> 00:45:59,730
Sound effects.

1026
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:01,470
Okay, so I guess I'll...

1027
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:03,610
Turn down the music.

1028
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:05,890
Holy shit.

1029
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:08,250
I'll turn down the music and then turn up the game volume.

1030
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:09,090
Would that help?

1031
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:09,970
Sound guy?

1032
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:11,570
Okay.

1033
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:13,970
Let's see if that helps.

1034
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:14,850
Okay, let's see.

1035
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:15,990
Reduce chatter.

1036
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:17,210
Hey, what?

1037
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:18,890
Let's reduce chatter, dude.

1038
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:21,170
Uh...

1039
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:22,190
Graphics.

1040
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:23,050
Window.

1041
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:23,590
Full screen.

1042
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:25,350
Okay, let's not do...

1043
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:26,350
Okay, get...

1044
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:28,050
Get out, motion blur!

1045
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:28,750
Leave!

1046
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:30,290
Advanced graphics.

1047
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:31,370
Whoa.

1048
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:33,590
Uh...

1049
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:34,250
I don't know.

1050
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:36,230
Actually, let's do high.

1051
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:37,010
Wait, what?

1052
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:40,610
Okay, let's do high, just in case.

1053
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:42,610
I feel like we don't need...

1054
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:44,290
No, we don't need all that.

1055
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:46,410
Uh...

1056
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:47,810
Alright, this should be good.

1057
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:50,850
Alright.

1058
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:52,310
Let's go.

1059
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:54,570
Ooh!

1060
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:55,970
Okay!

1061
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:58,660
Ooh.

1062
00:46:58,980 --> 00:46:59,860
I got tickets.

1063
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:00,980
What do the tickets do?

1064
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,460
Oh my god, I'm so cute.

1065
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:08,320
We're safe in this spot, Mickey.

1066
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,000
This control panel can be damaged with your spin move.

1067
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,980
Use your spin move by pressing X.

1068
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:17,000
Tickets, please.

1069
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,240
Yes, beat him!

1070
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:23,660
Come take care of this one.

1071
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:25,320
Okay, so I just have to destroy this.

1072
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:28,480
That's right.

1073
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,580
Get outta here!

1074
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:31,260
I destroyed your machine!

1075
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:35,120
Okay, yoink.

1076
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,600
My tickets now.

1077
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,220
Maybe it's like...

1078
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:40,280
An amusement park thing that I'm gonna have to do?

1079
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:41,620
Like if there's an arcade section?

1080
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:42,940
That's right.

1081
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:44,120
What the fuck are you gonna do?

1082
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,040
Punch me?

1083
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:46,700
Haha!

1084
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:48,200
I'm faster.

1085
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:52,020
I have a multi-million dollar company.

1086
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:53,800
Oh my god, did I...

1087
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:55,980
That's right.

1088
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,280
Get invincibility framed.

1089
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,480
Look, the mechanical arm destruction revealed a secret room.

1090
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,280
You may take a moment to explore if you like.

1091
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,640
Dango, they give us a super chat.

1092
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:13,980
Thank you.

1093
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:14,520
Thank you.

1094
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:15,840
I remember the teller short.

1095
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:19,260
The giant used a stove like a cigar lighter.

1096
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:19,820
Yeah!

1097
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:20,940
I remember that too!

1098
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:24,120
When you're ready, come to me and we'll get out of here.

1099
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:27,620
Alright, let's go to the secret room.

1100
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:28,580
I might...

1101
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:29,080
Okay, I...

1102
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:29,940
Oh, no fall damage.

1103
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:30,380
Yay!

1104
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:34,040
Gravity doesn't exist in Toontown.

1105
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:36,060
Assume it's...

1106
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:37,200
Is this a secret room?

1107
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,600
Okay, yes.

1108
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:41,060
Yeah, all of these look breakable.

1109
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:43,620
Actually, maybe I can play in epic mode.

1110
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,360
I was worried that like...

1111
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,420
I was gonna say like...

1112
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:49,500
I think I should be able to play an epic game...

1113
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,080
Epic mode.

1114
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:51,700
But I don't know if it's like...

1115
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:52,600
Noticeable too.

1116
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:54,460
Okay.

1117
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:56,660
Tell how...

1118
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:57,380
If it's possible.

1119
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:00,160
Yeah, I can.

1120
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,840
Alright, what's in here?

1121
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,080
Epic mode for Epic Mickey.

1122
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:08,460
Yay!

1123
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:09,960
Bronspin!

1124
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,340
Oh, it's a collectible.

1125
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:15,200
None are unique and commemorates specific events or places.

1126
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,400
Okay, so that's the collectible.

1127
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:21,460
Aw, they get sad when I rob them.

1128
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:22,300
That's right.

1129
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:23,540
My tickets now!

1130
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:25,460
What's this?

1131
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:28,220
Mad Doctor's Lab.

1132
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:30,360
Alright, let's go up.

1133
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,160
That's quite epic.

1134
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:33,300
Okay.

1135
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:35,560
Wait, what's this?

1136
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,180
That's an Oswald statue.

1137
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:38,820
Why is it gone?

1138
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:42,880
Be careful that...

1139
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,920
Remember that I can hurt you so you don't fall in.

1140
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:45,980
Okay, so...

1141
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:47,240
Don't touch the water.

1142
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:48,660
Mickey can't swim.

1143
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:51,540
Alright.

1144
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:52,760
Give me your money!

1145
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:54,820
There you go.

1146
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:57,160
Oh shit.

1147
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,660
I have to go walk all the way back here.

1148
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:00,520
God damn it.

1149
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:02,300
I'm too far.

1150
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:02,520
I'm too far.

1151
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:03,900
At least I'm getting the money...

1152
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:04,900
Like, extra tickets though.

1153
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:07,960
Can I run?

1154
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:09,140
Oh my god, there's dash.

1155
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,240
Tutorial didn't mean to teach me this.

1156
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:16,120
Thank god I can dash.

1157
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,800
I've learned the speedrun tech.

1158
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:18,200
Okay.

1159
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:21,480
Music up a tick.

1160
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:24,380
And then game volume up a little bit more.

1161
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:24,860
Okay.

1162
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,460
Okay, let me know if this is better.

1163
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:30,100
Okay.

1164
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:31,080
Oh, fuck.

1165
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:31,300
Okay.

1166
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:31,940
Don't worry.

1167
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:33,480
Gaming.

1168
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:37,220
I used to play Crash Bandicoot.

1169
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,740
I'm pretty good at platformers.

1170
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,320
Oh my god!

1171
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,740
I got pulled into this place by the Ink Master.

1172
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:47,600
A shadow butt.

1173
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,240
It's a thing made of pink and thinner.

1174
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:51,900
Oh boy.

1175
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,200
That block seemed awfully scared.

1176
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,240
Oh, the animation is so cute.

1177
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:58,600
That's thinner.

1178
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,220
This allows anything painted.

1179
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:01,740
Oh gosh.

1180
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:03,460
I wonder what else this brush can do.

1181
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:07,700
That's paint.

1182
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:08,980
It restores things.

1183
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:10,300
You're quite the artist.

1184
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:15,370
I love the animation.

1185
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:16,350
It's so cute.

1186
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:19,270
It's just full of surprises.

1187
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,080
I guess you soaked up some of the bulk.

1188
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:27,060
But I'm so...

1189
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:28,260
I'm so mean.

1190
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:29,980
Let's practice.

1191
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:31,680
Okay.

1192
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,820
To use the thinner or hold to use paint.

1193
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:36,780
But what do I...

1194
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:37,860
Do I paint that?

1195
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,080
Or...

1196
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:45,020
Oh!

1197
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:47,900
What did I do?

1198
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:49,180
Boy.

1199
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:51,380
Okay.

1200
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:52,820
Oh, so that's what...

1201
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:57,140
So, if I remove the thinner...

1202
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:59,400
What did I get?

1203
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:01,540
What did it get me?

1204
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,880
I don't even know what it gave me.

1205
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,840
Well, I'll be around when you need help.

1206
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,000
Okay.

1207
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,200
I'm squirting...

1208
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:14,520
Oh!

1209
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:15,560
Oh!

1210
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,200
It like reloads!

1211
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:17,740
I see.

1212
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:18,500
Okay.

1213
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:19,740
I see.

1214
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,940
Okay, so I have...

1215
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:23,180
Oh!

1216
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:24,520
So...

1217
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:27,160
I have like ammo for this.

1218
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:30,160
I get it now.

1219
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:31,520
Alright.

1220
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:32,260
So...

1221
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:33,300
If I...

1222
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:34,280
Put a thinner here.

1223
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:35,440
I can grab my ticket.

1224
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,280
Tickets, please.

1225
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:38,480
And I...

1226
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,400
And then...

1227
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,620
Pay for that.

1228
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:43,960
Does that...

1229
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,520
Actually do anything now?

1230
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,140
Oh, I guess it's just...

1231
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:48,720
To practice.

1232
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:50,600
And...

1233
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,920
Then press RT and hold to paint it.

1234
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:53,180
Okay.

1235
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:54,560
First I'll remove this.

1236
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:55,420
Doink!

1237
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:56,400
Mine now!

1238
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:58,380
Alright.

1239
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:00,700
Yay!

1240
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:05,800
Okay.

1241
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,460
Get rid of this.

1242
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:09,500
Is there any secret?

1243
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:10,940
Secret?

1244
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,760
Your brush can also thin out cartoon objects like that door frame.

1245
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:18,100
Point to the frame and hold to hit the thinner.

1246
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:20,420
Let me paint this first.

1247
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,720
I don't know if there's any secrets.

1248
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:26,920
Alright.

1249
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:28,000
Open the door!

1250
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:30,620
Oh, wait.

1251
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:30,900
Sorry.

1252
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:32,780
Let me delete the door!

1253
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:36,860
No door for you.

1254
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:38,640
That's right.

1255
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:40,420
I'll just delete it.

1256
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:42,700
Oh.

1257
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:46,500
Oh.

1258
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:48,460
Whoops.

1259
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:52,780
It looks like on the toon floor to clear the way.

1260
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,300
Oh, I can just paint.

1261
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,620
Oh, I can just delete the floor.

1262
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:57,240
I can delete your family.

1263
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:02,790
That's right.

1264
00:54:04,270 --> 00:54:06,090
Don't mess with me.

1265
00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:08,630
Or I'll delete your wife.

1266
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:11,890
Ryan, thank you for the super chat.

1267
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:12,310
Thank you.

1268
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:13,130
Thank you.

1269
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:15,930
The villains in the game are way over in their heads.

1270
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:17,510
They harm Mickey and Disney lawyers.

1271
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:19,450
They're gonna be on them like dogs.

1272
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:21,390
Okay.

1273
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:22,670
And then...

1274
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:24,530
I can walk over there.

1275
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:27,170
I'll delete it.

1276
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:28,370
Don't make me angry.

1277
00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:29,710
Oh, boy.

1278
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:30,890
Don't make me angry.

1279
00:54:31,210 --> 00:54:31,470
Uh-huh.

1280
00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:33,170
I'll release your family.

1281
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:37,870
Oh, hey, Oswald.

1282
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:39,750
Mickey and the Beanstalk!

1283
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:41,110
That's me!

1284
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:44,530
The exit is through this gate.

1285
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:48,870
That's scary.

1286
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:55,780
Alright.

1287
00:54:58,880 --> 00:54:59,740
Uh-oh.

1288
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:02,560
Part of the Bolt's bolting army.

1289
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:04,640
Are they...

1290
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:05,880
Oh, are they dangerous?

1291
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,340
Well, they're not good company.

1292
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:10,920
Get ready to fight.

1293
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:13,200
Use the RS to aim at your target.

1294
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,920
Over friends, the cursor looks like this.

1295
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:18,920
Over opponents, it looks like this.

1296
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,300
You can fight botlins in two ways.

1297
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:24,560
Hit them with a thinner to thin them out.

1298
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:26,720
Hit them with paint to turn them friendly.

1299
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:28,660
Friends!

1300
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:31,040
I can force them to be my friend!

1301
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,980
Time and point, you lose an HP.

1302
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:39,480
Lose all your pips.

1303
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,180
The seers are the only ones type of bolting...

1304
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:43,660
Other kinds of boltings are farmers.

1305
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:45,480
But you'll see soon enough.

1306
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:47,420
Oh, boy.

1307
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,620
Time to delete your family!

1308
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:50,260
Uh-huh!

1309
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:54,040
Alright.

1310
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,000
Give me your tickets.

1311
00:55:58,460 --> 00:55:59,460
Tickets, please.

1312
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:02,760
Tickets, please.

1313
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:05,800
Can I touch this?

1314
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:06,220
Okay.

1315
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:06,920
Yes, I can.

1316
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:07,880
Okay.

1317
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:08,760
It looked dangerous.

1318
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:09,240
Oh, wait.

1319
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:09,900
Can I paint?

1320
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:11,020
Ah!

1321
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:15,400
I thought it was like paint the roses like red and yellow or white.

1322
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:17,940
Like in Alice in Wonderland.

1323
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,080
Or can I delete it?

1324
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,120
I can!

1325
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,120
Wait, I can delete this?

1326
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:24,900
I knew it.

1327
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:26,020
I knew it.

1328
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:27,100
I knew it.

1329
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:27,960
I knew I could delete it.

1330
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:30,520
I seers saw you, Mickey.

1331
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:32,900
It looks like he called in a friend.

1332
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:34,020
Don't worry.

1333
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,840
I'll force them to be my friend.

1334
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:37,340
That's right.

1335
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,600
Be my friend!

1336
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:41,500
Yay!

1337
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,040
Oh, shit!

1338
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,080
Be my friend!

1339
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:47,480
I paid a win!

1340
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:48,620
I paid a win!

1341
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:50,520
Yay!

1342
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:51,840
Friends now!

1343
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:53,880
Hahaha!

1344
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:55,500
We're friends now, guys!

1345
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:56,600
Look at us go!

1346
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:59,460
Now I'll kill you!

1347
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:00,900
Hahaha!

1348
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:06,920
Oh, shit!

1349
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:10,580
Is he still friend?

1350
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:11,640
Friend?

1351
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:12,640
Still friend?

1352
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:13,640
Are you still friend?

1353
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:15,980
Okay, he's still friend.

1354
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:18,100
Okay, nice.

1355
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:18,660
Alright.

1356
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,560
I was gonna see if I could kill them after.

1357
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:23,200
But I think they're like friends forever.

1358
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:24,300
Haha!

1359
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:24,840
No!

1360
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:25,840
The betrayal!

1361
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:26,820
Haha!

1362
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:28,060
I don't know!

1363
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,380
Maybe they'll have something!

1364
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:30,520
I was thinking like...

1365
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,600
Maybe they'll have like extra money for me.

1366
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,960
Okay, let's get rid of this.

1367
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:38,140
Pew pew pew!

1368
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:41,600
It's okay.

1369
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:42,620
I can make new friends.

1370
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:47,220
I'll just paint a new friend into existence.

1371
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:50,900
Painting time.

1372
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:53,680
Just wanna make sure...

1373
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:54,820
I get enough stuff.

1374
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,320
This is a pressure plate.

1375
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,080
It will lower when you step on it.

1376
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,080
You can also make pressure plates go down.

1377
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,380
Faster by using Y while being the...

1378
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:04,520
Oh!

1379
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:05,720
It's like a little slam dunk.

1380
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:06,960
Yeah.

1381
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:12,470
Use your spin move on this gear.

1382
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:15,530
Remember that you can press X to perform a spin attack.

1383
00:58:15,810 --> 00:58:15,990
Alright.

1384
00:58:20,310 --> 00:58:21,590
That gremlin...

1385
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:22,170
Calvin.

1386
00:58:22,430 --> 00:58:23,870
He'll be so happy in it.

1387
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:24,270
Get out.

1388
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:25,710
No, he's gonna destroy my plane.

1389
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:28,290
He looks mad enough to break that catapult.

1390
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:30,690
When you see other gremlins, try to help them.

1391
00:58:30,830 --> 00:58:31,510
They'll be...

1392
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:31,910
Okay.

1393
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:39,750
My knowledge of Disney animated shorts reminded me that these little guys are bad people.

1394
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:43,950
Are they gonna destroy my plane?

1395
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:46,630
Thank you, Mickey.

1396
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:50,270
I feared the worst when the mad doctor put me on his thing.

1397
00:58:50,790 --> 00:58:51,290
Isn't that...

1398
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:51,530
Yeah.

1399
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:52,490
Aren't these the guys...

1400
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:55,070
There's the shorts where they destroy the plane and stuff?

1401
00:58:57,150 --> 00:58:58,690
How the fuck am I helping them?

1402
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:01,230
Now I don't want to endanger anyone else.

1403
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:03,170
Take this gold pin for freeing me.

1404
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:04,890
Oh, is that Bugs Bunny?

1405
00:59:05,090 --> 00:59:05,670
Oh, shit.

1406
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:08,430
Sorry, my animated shorts are blurring together.

1407
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:13,210
I thought it was...

1408
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:14,850
I didn't realize that was a Looney Tunes short.

1409
00:59:15,570 --> 00:59:18,630
To be fair, back then, all those shorts, like, are very similar.

1410
00:59:23,710 --> 00:59:25,610
I didn't realize that was a Looney Tunes one.

1411
00:59:26,090 --> 00:59:26,870
Because they both...

1412
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:28,370
They both had a Gremlin short.

1413
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:32,370
You must use your spin move on two different gates to open the way out.

1414
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:34,070
Look for the gears on the balcony.

1415
00:59:37,770 --> 00:59:39,570
Yeah, wrong universe, Joki.

1416
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:42,950
Okay, we gotta go upstairs.

1417
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:46,050
First thing, God, there's a dash button.

1418
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:47,350
Look, we're friends!

1419
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:48,630
Hello, friend!

1420
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:51,190
We're gonna lock this friend in.

1421
00:59:51,290 --> 00:59:52,830
You'll never be able to come out now.

1422
00:59:53,270 --> 00:59:54,990
I'll tell your wife you died.

1423
00:59:55,210 --> 00:59:56,690
In a horrific accident.

1424
00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:00,570
After this...

1425
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:01,290
I knew it.

1426
01:00:01,910 --> 01:00:02,210
Alright.

1427
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:06,370
We can run faster by...

1428
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:07,790
Oh, I can run faster!

1429
01:00:07,950 --> 01:00:08,110
Wait.

1430
01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:10,070
Oh!

1431
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:12,450
Okay, that's good to know.

1432
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:15,370
I didn't realize I can actually run faster.

1433
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:18,270
I thought it was just, uh...

1434
01:00:18,270 --> 01:00:18,910
The dash.

1435
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:21,330
Actually, what's faster?

1436
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:22,230
Dashing or...

1437
01:00:22,930 --> 01:00:23,530
Running?

1438
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:26,450
Okay.

1439
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:29,730
Gaining time.

1440
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:38,680
These green guardians, the turfs, will damage your enemies on contact.

1441
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:43,180
Your action in the world will determine what spirit, sort of guardian spirits you attract.

1442
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:44,280
Oh.

1443
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:45,960
Wait.

1444
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:47,820
Oh, no.

1445
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,220
Oh, no.

1446
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:50,040
Wait a minute.

1447
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:54,000
What I do will affect the...

1448
01:00:57,270 --> 01:00:57,870
Wait.

1449
01:00:58,470 --> 01:01:00,010
Those are good guardians, right?

1450
01:01:01,170 --> 01:01:02,130
Wait a minute.

1451
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:02,890
Oh, shit.

1452
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:03,750
Wait.

1453
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:05,150
No, I wasn't an asshole.

1454
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:06,170
I became friends.

1455
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:07,350
Yeah, it is.

1456
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:11,790
Don't be evil, Toki.

1457
01:01:11,790 --> 01:01:12,050
Yeah.

1458
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:16,970
Being evil is so fun.

1459
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:20,610
Oh my god.

1460
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:24,250
Are you telling me there's a genocide round in this game?

1461
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:28,610
I noticed the...

1462
01:01:28,610 --> 01:01:31,670
The consequences of my actions?

1463
01:01:34,310 --> 01:01:34,750
Okay.

1464
01:01:35,770 --> 01:01:36,190
Okay.

1465
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:36,810
This is a spin.

1466
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:44,080
Alright.

1467
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:44,920
You knock that gear.

1468
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:45,960
See the gate opening?

1469
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:47,300
One more gear will do.

1470
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:48,360
You're in wasteland.

1471
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:51,060
You'll find that gears and machines make all kinds of things happen.

1472
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:54,320
Repairing and starting them will often reveal secrets and treasures.

1473
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:54,680
Alright.

1474
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:55,460
Guys.

1475
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:57,080
Which is the better ending though?

1476
01:01:57,740 --> 01:01:59,280
Which ending is the best ending?

1477
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:00,200
Oh my god.

1478
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:01,280
Guys, there's fall damage.

1479
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:05,780
Even gravity won't stop for Mickey Mouse.

1480
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:11,920
Gravity doesn't stop for Mickey.

1481
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:15,960
Okay.

1482
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:17,920
Alright.

1483
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:18,140
Ooh.

1484
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:19,000
Items.

1485
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,760
Fall damage discovered.

1486
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:24,400
Alright.

1487
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:25,860
The good ending is the best.

1488
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:26,160
Okay.

1489
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:28,180
Wait.

1490
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,260
Which are the blue spirits?

1491
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:37,500
Because they're drawn to you, the blue ones will make friends of those who would otherwise harm you.

1492
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:38,260
Okay.

1493
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:39,800
Okay.

1494
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:41,520
So, good ending is more satisfying.

1495
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:43,280
That means I have to...

1496
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:45,540
I have to make sure I'm not evil.

1497
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:48,000
Okay.

1498
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:48,660
I knew it.

1499
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:50,560
I was like, why would the wall...

1500
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:53,240
Why would the fuck would the wall be like...

1501
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:54,080
Like...

1502
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:54,520
Thinner?

1503
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:57,580
To center the camera in front of you.

1504
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:57,900
Okay.

1505
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:59,340
I think I need that.

1506
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:02,600
Uh...

1507
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:03,660
That's crazy.

1508
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:04,460
I can't believe...

1509
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:04,740
Ah!

1510
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:05,360
Okay.

1511
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:05,780
Okay.

1512
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:06,920
Parkour.

1513
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:09,980
Parkour.

1514
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,420
Good ending is boring.

1515
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,880
Evil lets you kill things faster.

1516
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:21,720
Ah!

1517
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:21,900
Ah!

1518
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:22,520
There it is!

1519
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,460
I'm wearing that outfit right now!

1520
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:27,920
It's just one heart.

1521
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:29,060
Ah!

1522
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:31,420
Ah!

1523
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:32,440
Ah!

1524
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:32,760
Ah!

1525
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:34,060
Ah!

1526
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:35,180
Ah!

1527
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:35,940
Ah!

1528
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:37,180
Ah!

1529
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:37,220
Ah!

1530
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:38,060
Ah!

1531
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:38,500
Let's head over.

1532
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:40,980
How do I...

1533
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:42,420
Get into this chest though?

1534
01:03:46,170 --> 01:03:47,150
What the fuck?

1535
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:50,430
I can't get in.

1536
01:03:50,810 --> 01:03:51,050
Ugh.

1537
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:51,810
Maybe later.

1538
01:03:53,110 --> 01:03:53,490
Alright.

1539
01:03:55,890 --> 01:03:56,690
Knock knock!

1540
01:03:59,410 --> 01:04:01,470
Are you ready to enter the projecting stream?

1541
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:01,850
Yeah!

1542
01:04:02,170 --> 01:04:03,290
I'm ready dressed for it!

1543
01:04:03,830 --> 01:04:04,350
Nope.

1544
01:04:04,570 --> 01:04:05,990
That rabbit went this way.

1545
01:04:06,630 --> 01:04:07,050
Guys, look.

1546
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:07,990
This is how we get around.

1547
01:04:08,490 --> 01:04:09,790
The rabbit is named Oswald.

1548
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:10,610
He set them up.

1549
01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:11,350
But...

1550
01:04:11,350 --> 01:04:12,450
What a projector screen?

1551
01:04:12,950 --> 01:04:13,930
What's so strange?

1552
01:04:14,110 --> 01:04:15,290
Seems natural for cartoons.

1553
01:04:16,210 --> 01:04:16,850
Well, uh...

1554
01:04:16,850 --> 01:04:17,510
What's in there?

1555
01:04:18,070 --> 01:04:19,390
Just get ready to jump.

1556
01:04:21,870 --> 01:04:22,390
Ah!

1557
01:04:27,850 --> 01:04:28,370
Ah!

1558
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:28,550
Wow!

1559
01:04:29,090 --> 01:04:31,330
Oh, it's now like a 2D platformer.

1560
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:35,050
Oh!

1561
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:36,190
I love the music!

1562
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:37,410
It's so cute!

1563
01:04:40,890 --> 01:04:42,010
Wait, can I not run?

1564
01:04:42,190 --> 01:04:43,670
Oh, I can't run during this.

1565
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:46,170
Okay.

1566
01:04:46,390 --> 01:04:47,530
I assume I have to...

1567
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:49,110
Grab the film.

1568
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:50,870
What?

1569
01:04:51,650 --> 01:04:52,130
What?

1570
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:55,890
The fuck do I grab it?

1571
01:04:57,050 --> 01:04:58,250
I'll jump here.

1572
01:05:00,790 --> 01:05:01,890
Zoom here.

1573
01:05:02,430 --> 01:05:03,490
Wait, how do I grab that?

1574
01:05:04,090 --> 01:05:04,650
Oh!

1575
01:05:04,730 --> 01:05:05,230
The chimney!

1576
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:05,690
Okay.

1577
01:05:07,610 --> 01:05:09,250
And I go down the chimney.

1578
01:05:10,090 --> 01:05:10,350
Yay!

1579
01:05:12,130 --> 01:05:12,950
Found Mickey and...

1580
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:13,350
Oh!

1581
01:05:13,450 --> 01:05:15,430
Do I get to watch the show for free?

1582
01:05:17,270 --> 01:05:17,870
Wait!

1583
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:19,190
If I get the...

1584
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:21,310
Can I watch the actual cartoon short?

1585
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:23,050
In game?

1586
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:25,130
I'm like Santa.

1587
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:26,570
Oh!

1588
01:05:27,170 --> 01:05:28,090
Oh, that's so cute!

1589
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:29,210
Wait, how do I watch it?

1590
01:05:30,870 --> 01:05:31,670
Amid dash?

1591
01:05:31,850 --> 01:05:32,010
No.

1592
01:05:33,170 --> 01:05:34,090
Oh, that's nice.

1593
01:05:34,290 --> 01:05:35,230
That's actually really cute.

1594
01:05:35,330 --> 01:05:35,890
I like that.

1595
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:37,690
Oh my god!

1596
01:05:37,830 --> 01:05:40,230
And there's like a film thing at the edge!

1597
01:05:43,130 --> 01:05:43,610
Oh!

1598
01:05:44,430 --> 01:05:45,150
I like that.

1599
01:05:45,210 --> 01:05:45,970
I like this short.

1600
01:05:46,790 --> 01:05:48,350
Like, I have memories of it.

1601
01:05:49,950 --> 01:05:50,410
Yeah.

1602
01:05:53,270 --> 01:05:54,690
What's on that side though?

1603
01:05:55,550 --> 01:05:56,830
Okay, we have to go this way.

1604
01:05:58,370 --> 01:06:00,030
Yes, I don't think we can go the other way.

1605
01:06:01,830 --> 01:06:02,810
What do I ever do?

1606
01:06:03,590 --> 01:06:04,170
Okay, wait.

1607
01:06:04,230 --> 01:06:05,430
They can actually do a lot of things.

1608
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:06,710
Never mind.

1609
01:06:07,010 --> 01:06:07,570
Never mind.

1610
01:06:07,850 --> 01:06:09,090
I was gonna say, what are you going to do?

1611
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:10,170
And I realize, wait, no.

1612
01:06:10,330 --> 01:06:12,010
Those two lawyers are actually scary.

1613
01:06:14,510 --> 01:06:15,970
I wanna make sure there's nothing here.

1614
01:06:16,090 --> 01:06:16,670
Oh, I knew it.

1615
01:06:16,710 --> 01:06:17,730
I knew there was something here.

1616
01:06:19,030 --> 01:06:19,350
Yay!

1617
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:21,530
I got another Mickey and the Beanstalk.

1618
01:06:23,590 --> 01:06:24,410
Is that all of it?

1619
01:06:24,470 --> 01:06:25,450
Is it just two guys?

1620
01:06:25,950 --> 01:06:27,450
I'm gonna drop this way just in case.

1621
01:06:28,170 --> 01:06:28,890
I knew it.

1622
01:06:29,210 --> 01:06:30,590
I knew there was something here.

1623
01:06:30,830 --> 01:06:31,130
No!

1624
01:06:31,490 --> 01:06:31,970
Oh shit.

1625
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:32,650
I'm okay.

1626
01:06:33,450 --> 01:06:34,450
How the fuck do I...

1627
01:06:35,390 --> 01:06:36,570
How the fuck do I get over there?

1628
01:06:38,350 --> 01:06:39,010
Okay, nice.

1629
01:06:39,210 --> 01:06:40,330
I knew there was something here.

1630
01:06:41,290 --> 01:06:41,990
Beanstalk 3.

1631
01:06:42,930 --> 01:06:45,410
I knew my Achievement Hunter jeans.

1632
01:06:46,990 --> 01:06:49,070
Jeans smelled something over there.

1633
01:06:51,570 --> 01:06:51,970
Alright.

1634
01:06:52,270 --> 01:06:52,890
Up I go.

1635
01:06:53,850 --> 01:06:54,170
Yay!

1636
01:06:55,490 --> 01:06:56,550
What's that sound guy?

1637
01:06:56,790 --> 01:06:58,070
Is everything okay now?

1638
01:06:58,410 --> 01:06:59,130
The volume?

1639
01:07:00,190 --> 01:07:02,050
I don't think I heard the confirmation.

1640
01:07:05,050 --> 01:07:07,230
Would you like to travel to slum?

1641
01:07:07,450 --> 01:07:07,750
Yeah.

1642
01:07:09,690 --> 01:07:10,390
That's cute.

1643
01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:12,590
There's a little side-scrolling area.

1644
01:07:16,210 --> 01:07:18,210
My gamer senses were tingling.

1645
01:07:22,890 --> 01:07:24,090
Hey, it's Gremlin.

1646
01:07:24,690 --> 01:07:25,230
Taiso.

1647
01:07:25,390 --> 01:07:26,630
What are you doing, Taiso?

1648
01:07:27,190 --> 01:07:27,770
Hi, Gus.

1649
01:07:28,090 --> 01:07:29,570
Someone sabotaged this door.

1650
01:07:29,990 --> 01:07:31,470
It's gonna take paint to fix it.

1651
01:07:32,350 --> 01:07:33,990
That's an impressive door.

1652
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:36,030
Definitely Gremlin construction.

1653
01:07:37,370 --> 01:07:38,250
Hey, Mickey.

1654
01:07:38,570 --> 01:07:39,570
Can you throw paint around?

1655
01:07:39,790 --> 01:07:41,530
Why not paint those gears for Taiso?

1656
01:07:41,530 --> 01:07:42,470
Yeah.

1657
01:07:43,430 --> 01:07:44,010
That'd be great.

1658
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:45,970
I've been working on that Milgear.

1659
01:07:46,130 --> 01:07:47,070
So don't break it, please.

1660
01:07:48,750 --> 01:07:49,210
Oh.

1661
01:07:51,930 --> 01:07:52,450
See?

1662
01:07:53,150 --> 01:07:54,230
I did it.

1663
01:07:54,910 --> 01:07:55,430
Hooray!

1664
01:07:55,690 --> 01:07:56,350
You fixed it!

1665
01:07:56,670 --> 01:07:57,490
What the fuck is that?

1666
01:07:58,570 --> 01:07:59,390
Oh no.

1667
01:07:59,590 --> 01:08:00,270
Did you see that?

1668
01:08:00,950 --> 01:08:04,390
It's a nasty thing related to the seers back there.

1669
01:08:05,110 --> 01:08:06,210
The metal gear.

1670
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:09,650
That pipe section is sitting out letting steams...

1671
01:08:09,650 --> 01:08:10,810
Don't touch the steam.

1672
01:08:11,010 --> 01:08:12,050
I'll knock you back.

1673
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:14,650
Please patch those pipes when you see them.

1674
01:08:15,110 --> 01:08:15,250
Okay.

1675
01:08:16,450 --> 01:08:17,530
Thank you for your help.

1676
01:08:17,810 --> 01:08:20,730
Only some of your unique talent for creating paint have done it.

1677
01:08:21,970 --> 01:08:23,690
I'll meet you further down the line.

1678
01:08:23,890 --> 01:08:25,050
I'm sure of it.

1679
01:08:25,990 --> 01:08:26,470
Alright.

1680
01:08:26,590 --> 01:08:28,070
We gotta patch the pipes later.

1681
01:08:29,390 --> 01:08:29,870
Okay.

1682
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:30,810
Tickets, please.

1683
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:34,010
Now I...

1684
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:34,510
Oh nice!

1685
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:35,070
I knew it.

1686
01:08:35,210 --> 01:08:35,550
How's that?

1687
01:08:36,490 --> 01:08:38,950
Can I break open these workers' lockers?

1688
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:40,830
Okay.

1689
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:41,510
We go this way.

1690
01:08:43,690 --> 01:08:44,210
Paint!

1691
01:08:46,450 --> 01:08:47,650
I'm a handyman.

1692
01:08:48,810 --> 01:08:49,170
Okay.

1693
01:08:49,330 --> 01:08:51,090
Is there anything else I need to delete?

1694
01:08:51,970 --> 01:08:52,970
There is again!

1695
01:08:53,350 --> 01:08:54,690
We should be able to get...

1696
01:08:54,690 --> 01:08:55,610
Go that way too!

1697
01:08:55,850 --> 01:08:56,930
But watch your step!

1698
01:08:57,870 --> 01:08:58,130
Alright.

1699
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:00,730
From where I can paint my step.

1700
01:09:04,550 --> 01:09:05,070
Wait.

1701
01:09:06,770 --> 01:09:07,730
Is there something?

1702
01:09:08,030 --> 01:09:08,610
Okay, no.

1703
01:09:11,390 --> 01:09:12,970
Didn't that big gear...

1704
01:09:12,970 --> 01:09:14,810
Or use paint to patch the...

1705
01:09:14,810 --> 01:09:15,230
Oh.

1706
01:09:15,690 --> 01:09:16,210
Nice.

1707
01:09:17,350 --> 01:09:18,070
Alright.

1708
01:09:19,510 --> 01:09:20,510
Well done.

1709
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:23,710
Look, I'm fixing things!

1710
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:25,430
For free!

1711
01:09:27,790 --> 01:09:28,510
Yay!

1712
01:09:29,130 --> 01:09:30,910
I don't get paid to do this!

1713
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:36,720
Let's grab that.

1714
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:39,880
Nice.

1715
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:41,820
And then that should be everything.

1716
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:43,600
Yay!

1717
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:45,380
Free handyman work!

1718
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:49,360
To pull in a double jump, press A in the middle of a jump.

1719
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:51,760
Well, I've been platforming this entire time.

1720
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:53,840
I know how to double jump, old man.

1721
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:54,700
Oh wait!

1722
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:55,660
Item!

1723
01:09:58,560 --> 01:09:59,040
Yay!

1724
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:01,260
Tickets, please!

1725
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:02,920
Guys, it's worth it.

1726
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:03,400
It's item.

1727
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:06,060
What's that over here?

1728
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:07,300
More tickets!

1729
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:09,140
Yes!

1730
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,280
Give me all the tickets.

1731
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:12,720
Oh shit!

1732
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:13,160
Oh!

1733
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:14,160
I'm fine.

1734
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:17,800
Okay, more things for me to platform.

1735
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:21,580
Alright.

1736
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:29,660
Um, handyman work is like, very vital and like, um, very expensive now.

1737
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,600
Because no one wants to do handyman stuff.

1738
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:33,960
So, uh, I know my words.

1739
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:37,560
Wait, how do I?

1740
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:40,380
Oh, I can't get that.

1741
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:46,340
Wait, that's not supposed to seal something unless there's an emergency.

1742
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:46,640
Let's see.

1743
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,840
Is this... a trap?

1744
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:51,500
It is a trap!

1745
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:54,300
Someone shut the door and now a splatter has leaked in here!

1746
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:58,180
Father... Father, please love me!

1747
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:02,940
Look, Father!

1748
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:05,040
I have your ears!

1749
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:08,120
They're really solitary creatures.

1750
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:10,320
Please love me!

1751
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:15,160
Hey!

1752
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:16,620
You splatters?

1753
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:19,120
Peter or Mickey will give you what for.

1754
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:21,880
Why did you abandon us, Father?

1755
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:28,700
Well now, there's no problem with the exit being closed.

1756
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:33,180
Oh!

1757
01:11:33,860 --> 01:11:35,160
The gremlin fixed it.

1758
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:38,580
Let me clear the path to this collectible for you.

1759
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:38,960
Enjoy.

1760
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:41,960
Oh my god, there's so many.

1761
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:43,400
Hold on now!

1762
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:44,600
That's Oswald!

1763
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,460
Could he have set this trap?

1764
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:48,360
Why does he hate me?

1765
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:54,700
It's not my fault you got abandoned and given to Universal and then I became a multi-million dollar mascot?

1766
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:56,180
It's not my fault!

1767
01:11:58,840 --> 01:11:59,380
It's not my fault!

1768
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:01,180
How is that my fault?

1769
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:09,440
It's not my fault you were here first and then I ended up taking all the glory?

1770
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:15,060
Oh my god, look at all these Mickey's kids!

1771
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,280
He's just a hater!

1772
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:18,320
I know, right?

1773
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:19,880
He's such a hater!

1774
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:21,400
Oh my god, it's like Disneyland!

1775
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:28,410
The Guardians of your Track can help you in several ways!

1776
01:12:29,890 --> 01:12:33,110
RB and one of your Guardians will race you to your nearest opponent!

1777
01:12:33,730 --> 01:12:35,210
But wait, there's more!

1778
01:12:37,070 --> 01:12:39,670
RB to launch all of your Guardians!

1779
01:12:42,470 --> 01:12:43,270
Unleash sooner!

1780
01:12:43,630 --> 01:12:45,130
That'll do the same but with paint!

1781
01:12:48,590 --> 01:12:49,970
These ways will disappear!

1782
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:56,520
Alright.

1783
01:13:00,470 --> 01:13:03,010
Looks like Gremlin Tim is trapped in a ticket booth!

1784
01:13:03,150 --> 01:13:04,610
Oh my god, that's where I get my tickets!

1785
01:13:07,470 --> 01:13:08,630
Hey, you over there!

1786
01:13:08,830 --> 01:13:09,530
Help me!

1787
01:13:09,890 --> 01:13:12,250
Deal with these creatures that trapped me in here, please!

1788
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:13,410
Okay.

1789
01:13:14,610 --> 01:13:15,290
Alright.

1790
01:13:17,050 --> 01:13:17,850
Father, please!

1791
01:13:18,390 --> 01:13:19,210
Father, please!

1792
01:13:21,090 --> 01:13:22,310
Oh my god!

1793
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:25,330
Why did Mickey have so many kids?

1794
01:13:27,290 --> 01:13:27,970
Mickey!

1795
01:13:30,970 --> 01:13:33,430
Why did you have so many children?

1796
01:13:34,550 --> 01:13:35,930
Oh my god!

1797
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:39,230
Wait, they're all friends.

1798
01:13:39,470 --> 01:13:40,590
We're all friends here.

1799
01:13:41,010 --> 01:13:41,670
Are we not?

1800
01:13:41,670 --> 01:13:42,190
Oh, yeah.

1801
01:13:44,450 --> 01:13:44,470
Alright.

1802
01:13:45,290 --> 01:13:45,810
Spatters.

1803
01:13:46,170 --> 01:13:49,170
Just because Mickey went easy on you doesn't mean I will...

1804
01:13:49,170 --> 01:13:49,770
Beat it!

1805
01:13:53,290 --> 01:13:55,090
I'll start those boats for you now!

1806
01:13:55,310 --> 01:13:56,730
You can jump on them anytime!

1807
01:13:59,510 --> 01:14:00,030
He's...

1808
01:14:00,030 --> 01:14:01,870
He's a mouse, Doki.

1809
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:04,910
The Guardians of your Track can help you in several ways.

1810
01:14:05,290 --> 01:14:08,190
You can track more by painting or thinning the world around you.

1811
01:14:08,190 --> 01:14:13,290
The bar at the top left of your screen shows your progress in interacting with the Guardians.

1812
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:16,930
Each Tecmo bar you complete attracts a new Guardian.

1813
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:20,510
The Guardians exists to help you, Mickey.

1814
01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:22,910
Why is anyone's guess?

1815
01:14:25,030 --> 01:14:25,450
Okay.

1816
01:14:26,210 --> 01:14:28,410
Thank you for taking care of all of the blotlings.

1817
01:14:29,230 --> 01:14:29,770
We have time.

1818
01:14:30,010 --> 01:14:31,590
There are other riders here that need your help.

1819
01:14:32,150 --> 01:14:35,770
I'd love to start a ride, but it seems the machinery is broken.

1820
01:14:36,110 --> 01:14:37,370
I need my wrench.

1821
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:42,410
I was working on a spinning cup with a red stripe on top of it when a spatter is attacked.

1822
01:14:43,110 --> 01:14:44,290
Haven't seen it since.

1823
01:14:44,830 --> 01:14:48,370
If you're willing to help, come see me near the machine behind the elephant ride.

1824
01:14:49,130 --> 01:14:49,610
Okay.

1825
01:14:49,970 --> 01:14:51,110
Oh, I know what to do with that.

1826
01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:52,350
I just break it, right?

1827
01:14:53,190 --> 01:14:54,290
That's all I know.

1828
01:14:55,250 --> 01:14:57,530
All I know is to break things.

1829
01:14:58,310 --> 01:14:59,790
That is my purpose.

1830
01:15:01,570 --> 01:15:01,830
Okay.

1831
01:15:02,010 --> 01:15:02,430
Pick it.

1832
01:15:02,810 --> 01:15:03,330
Pick it.

1833
01:15:05,990 --> 01:15:06,470
Okay.

1834
01:15:06,870 --> 01:15:08,590
I don't know what needs to be painted.

1835
01:15:09,550 --> 01:15:10,450
Can I remove that?

1836
01:15:11,490 --> 01:15:12,330
I can.

1837
01:15:13,770 --> 01:15:15,110
Is there anything up here?

1838
01:15:15,290 --> 01:15:16,210
Oh, I knew it.

1839
01:15:17,870 --> 01:15:19,730
It felt very removable.

1840
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:23,130
All right.

1841
01:15:26,750 --> 01:15:28,550
I know, nothing here seems removable.

1842
01:15:28,710 --> 01:15:29,550
Oh, wait, Oswald!

1843
01:15:31,830 --> 01:15:33,370
There's Oswald's statue.

1844
01:15:35,170 --> 01:15:36,370
I mean, I can remove this?

1845
01:15:36,510 --> 01:15:37,050
Oh, I can.

1846
01:15:38,770 --> 01:15:39,290
Okay.

1847
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:43,650
Oh, I can, like, paint the world back.

1848
01:15:44,030 --> 01:15:45,210
Oh, that's cute.

1849
01:15:45,490 --> 01:15:46,190
I like that.

1850
01:15:47,870 --> 01:15:48,250
Oh, wait.

1851
01:15:48,630 --> 01:15:49,870
I need this, though.

1852
01:15:52,010 --> 01:15:53,190
All right, we paint this.

1853
01:15:53,330 --> 01:15:53,830
Oh, my God.

1854
01:15:53,870 --> 01:15:54,750
You're an ugly child.

1855
01:15:54,930 --> 01:15:55,530
Get out of here.

1856
01:15:56,330 --> 01:15:56,910
All right.

1857
01:15:58,530 --> 01:15:58,930
Uh...

1858
01:15:58,930 --> 01:15:59,670
You know what?

1859
01:16:00,290 --> 01:16:01,750
Oswald doesn't deserve this.

1860
01:16:04,050 --> 01:16:05,290
Get out of here!

1861
01:16:08,090 --> 01:16:09,550
Yeah, I should be nice.

1862
01:16:09,550 --> 01:16:10,470
I'll put him in here.

1863
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:11,570
Because I am...

1864
01:16:11,570 --> 01:16:13,290
I am a better person.

1865
01:16:16,150 --> 01:16:16,730
All right.

1866
01:16:18,710 --> 01:16:19,750
Still haven't found it?

1867
01:16:19,870 --> 01:16:22,150
Yeah, I'm pretty sure the spinning cup had a red stripe.

1868
01:16:22,610 --> 01:16:23,550
I remember because...

1869
01:16:23,550 --> 01:16:23,750
Oh!

1870
01:16:23,970 --> 01:16:26,030
I have to go to the spinning cup to find it.

1871
01:16:26,870 --> 01:16:27,190
Okay.

1872
01:16:27,630 --> 01:16:28,310
It should be here.

1873
01:16:30,450 --> 01:16:30,930
Uh...

1874
01:16:30,930 --> 01:16:31,430
Oh, my God.

1875
01:16:31,550 --> 01:16:32,730
This is not safe for kids.

1876
01:16:33,270 --> 01:16:34,790
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

1877
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:36,550
This?

1878
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:39,310
You sure this have my...

1879
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:41,410
Oh!

1880
01:16:41,890 --> 01:16:43,010
I can make it disappear!

1881
01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:46,290
Oh, I see.

1882
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:50,190
I see.

1883
01:16:51,170 --> 01:16:53,010
Does that mean there's items in all of these?

1884
01:16:55,430 --> 01:16:56,170
Let's see.

1885
01:16:56,410 --> 01:16:56,610
No?

1886
01:16:56,970 --> 01:16:57,430
All right.

1887
01:16:58,810 --> 01:16:59,610
Oh, so if I...

1888
01:16:59,610 --> 01:17:03,390
To get the bad ending, I just make this entire world disappear, right?

1889
01:17:04,670 --> 01:17:07,970
Yeah, I don't like how there's, like, sharp edges and stuff in it.

1890
01:17:08,370 --> 01:17:08,910
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

1891
01:17:12,930 --> 01:17:14,830
Okay, let's paint this back.

1892
01:17:16,810 --> 01:17:17,330
Oh!

1893
01:17:18,650 --> 01:17:19,690
Okay, so...

1894
01:17:20,290 --> 01:17:22,930
Bad ending, basically, I just delete all their rides.

1895
01:17:25,230 --> 01:17:26,730
Yeah, I'll paint these back.

1896
01:17:28,070 --> 01:17:29,650
That'll make me a real asshole.

1897
01:17:31,130 --> 01:17:32,690
Oh, the game down a little bit?

1898
01:17:32,830 --> 01:17:33,050
Okay.

1899
01:17:33,350 --> 01:17:33,730
Whoa!

1900
01:17:34,270 --> 01:17:35,470
Oh, my gosh, the...

1901
01:17:36,210 --> 01:17:37,250
I try...

1902
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:37,790
I...

1903
01:17:37,790 --> 01:17:40,550
Just using my mouse and the mouse sense is crazy.

1904
01:17:41,210 --> 01:17:41,930
Ha, ha, ha!

1905
01:17:42,430 --> 01:17:45,850
I was not expecting the mouse sense to be like that.

1906
01:17:46,290 --> 01:17:48,410
All right, I brought the game volume...

1907
01:17:49,750 --> 01:17:50,270
Down.

1908
01:17:51,410 --> 01:17:51,970
My wrench!

1909
01:17:52,170 --> 01:17:54,510
Now I can fix the broken elephant ride machine!

1910
01:17:55,150 --> 01:17:55,410
Yay!

1911
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:03,830
The spinning cup ride is malfunctioning as well.

1912
01:18:04,230 --> 01:18:04,750
All right.

1913
01:18:04,870 --> 01:18:07,530
Looks like the pipes behind the maintenance area walls are leaking.

1914
01:18:07,950 --> 01:18:09,090
That's my guess.

1915
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:13,430
Non-flying types like you can use the elephant ride to jump up on the...

1916
01:18:13,430 --> 01:18:14,190
big tent.

1917
01:18:14,550 --> 01:18:16,550
From there, you can reach the maintenance area.

1918
01:18:16,990 --> 01:18:19,690
It's a difficult path, but you seem to be capable.

1919
01:18:19,690 --> 01:18:21,090
It'll be me.

1920
01:18:21,310 --> 01:18:24,230
I'll be over behind the spinning cup ride, examining the machine.

1921
01:18:25,070 --> 01:18:25,870
That's right.

1922
01:18:26,090 --> 01:18:27,930
Nothing is impossible for me.

1923
01:18:28,510 --> 01:18:29,050
Uh-huh!

1924
01:18:31,410 --> 01:18:32,570
Cause I'm gaming...

1925
01:18:32,570 --> 01:18:32,930
Okay, wait.

1926
01:18:33,350 --> 01:18:34,550
Cause I'm gaming!

1927
01:18:35,190 --> 01:18:36,970
Take me up there, Dumbo!

1928
01:18:38,010 --> 01:18:39,250
That's fucking right.

1929
01:18:42,570 --> 01:18:43,370
Okay.

1930
01:18:44,090 --> 01:18:44,510
Okay.

1931
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:50,250
As I was saying...

1932
01:18:50,770 --> 01:18:52,490
Cause I'm gaming!

1933
01:18:56,830 --> 01:18:59,110
There's no seat belts on this.

1934
01:18:59,450 --> 01:19:00,590
Even better!

1935
01:19:01,910 --> 01:19:02,910
Okay, nice.

1936
01:19:02,990 --> 01:19:03,410
We got it.

1937
01:19:06,370 --> 01:19:07,950
It should be around.

1938
01:19:07,950 --> 01:19:08,390
Here.

1939
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:08,570
Oh!

1940
01:19:08,670 --> 01:19:09,150
I should've been...

1941
01:19:09,150 --> 01:19:09,330
Oh!

1942
01:19:09,470 --> 01:19:10,350
I was supposed to...

1943
01:19:10,350 --> 01:19:11,110
Jump here.

1944
01:19:11,270 --> 01:19:11,490
Oops!

1945
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:15,750
Let's fix this area real quick.

1946
01:19:17,270 --> 01:19:18,510
I can go here.

1947
01:19:19,470 --> 01:19:20,650
Wait, what does this do?

1948
01:19:20,950 --> 01:19:21,210
Oh.

1949
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:23,710
Okay, that doesn't need to be fixed though.

1950
01:19:25,070 --> 01:19:27,130
Let's get the creepy dolls out of here first.

1951
01:19:28,570 --> 01:19:29,430
Now stop rotating!

1952
01:19:29,710 --> 01:19:30,790
Pain will start it again!

1953
01:19:32,930 --> 01:19:33,890
Okay, so...

1954
01:19:33,890 --> 01:19:34,530
Like that?

1955
01:19:35,810 --> 01:19:36,490
Okay, yeah.

1956
01:19:36,610 --> 01:19:37,630
Maybe not like that.

1957
01:19:39,270 --> 01:19:41,290
A bad ending.

1958
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:43,890
Okay, nice.

1959
01:19:44,410 --> 01:19:46,070
Oh wait, there's a collectible down here.

1960
01:19:47,710 --> 01:19:48,390
Uh...

1961
01:19:48,390 --> 01:19:49,150
I'll get it later.

1962
01:19:49,970 --> 01:19:52,030
Cause I feel like I have to do this first.

1963
01:19:56,380 --> 01:19:57,700
Okay, nice.

1964
01:19:58,640 --> 01:19:59,060
Alright.

1965
01:19:59,060 --> 01:19:59,760
Oh!

1966
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:03,720
Oh my god, there was a little gap.

1967
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:05,660
I didn't notice the little gap.

1968
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:07,760
Okay.

1969
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,060
This has to be the...

1970
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:12,460
Standard equipment on most rides.

1971
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:16,340
It can be filled with either paint or thinner, but never both at the same time.

1972
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:18,940
Paint often thinks things up.

1973
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,380
Get the ride running smoother.

1974
01:20:21,580 --> 01:20:23,440
Thinner attempts to throw a wrench in the works.

1975
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:24,780
Sometimes that's handy, though.

1976
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:28,020
A paint and thinner pump is always connected to something.

1977
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:30,460
This one's connected to a spinning cup ride.

1978
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:33,300
In this case, it's connected with two pipes.

1979
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:38,380
Filling it with thinner may have unexpected consequences.

1980
01:20:38,620 --> 01:20:39,040
Okay, guys.

1981
01:20:39,220 --> 01:20:40,620
Can I fix things?

1982
01:20:40,940 --> 01:20:43,360
If I... I need to know.

1983
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:48,460
Is it fixable if I...

1984
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:53,760
If I accidentally fuck it up?

1985
01:20:58,420 --> 01:21:01,300
Can I have an oopsie moment?

1986
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:06,740
Turkey, think long and hard.

1987
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:09,940
Which pink you wanna use?

1988
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:10,300
Okay.

1989
01:21:10,820 --> 01:21:12,460
But Kevin's like, oopsie.

1990
01:21:16,340 --> 01:21:19,240
Okay, I won't fill it with thinner.

1991
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,560
You fixed the ride!

1992
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:28,340
That makes me feel much better.

1993
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:33,420
In fact, so much better that I can open this door for you.

1994
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:36,540
My bad, bro.

1995
01:21:36,620 --> 01:21:38,800
I'll be like, oops, my bad.

1996
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:40,140
Boys will be boys.

1997
01:21:41,140 --> 01:21:44,160
In fact, so much better that I can open this door for you.

1998
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:48,340
Please, keep whatever you may find in there, along with my gratitude.

1999
01:21:49,820 --> 01:21:50,860
Okay, fine.

2000
01:21:50,860 --> 01:21:51,340
I...

2001
01:21:51,860 --> 01:21:53,280
I won't...

2002
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:54,860
I won't accidentally...

2003
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:57,520
Use thinner.

2004
01:22:02,620 --> 01:22:03,180
Uh...

2005
01:22:03,180 --> 01:22:03,740
Let's see.

2006
01:22:05,540 --> 01:22:07,120
Let's grab my collectible.

2007
01:22:08,140 --> 01:22:08,700
Yeah!

2008
01:22:12,450 --> 01:22:13,010
Okay.

2009
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:13,810
Oh, shit.

2010
01:22:14,010 --> 01:22:14,490
What the fuck?

2011
01:22:15,270 --> 01:22:16,210
Oh, there's the boat.

2012
01:22:17,290 --> 01:22:19,050
Oh, I have to go to that boat later.

2013
01:22:20,050 --> 01:22:21,770
What did he open for me?

2014
01:22:22,530 --> 01:22:22,990
This?

2015
01:22:23,890 --> 01:22:25,470
Oh, that's what he opened.

2016
01:22:26,910 --> 01:22:27,610
Hello.

2017
01:22:29,930 --> 01:22:30,970
What's in here?

2018
01:22:31,870 --> 01:22:32,410
Oh!

2019
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:37,200
Nice!

2020
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:40,820
Alright, sound, guys.

2021
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:42,520
So, overall volume a lot better now.

2022
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:43,520
Tickets!

2023
01:22:44,540 --> 01:22:44,920
Yay!

2024
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:46,520
Tickets, please.

2025
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:48,040
Okay.

2026
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:49,180
Overall, just...

2027
01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:50,880
You know, I could just do it in the master, actually.

2028
01:22:54,780 --> 01:22:55,180
Uh...

2029
01:22:58,660 --> 01:22:59,460
Alright, uh...

2030
01:22:59,900 --> 01:23:00,380
Actually, no.

2031
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:04,180
I feel like master volume is, like, super sensitive when I do it here.

2032
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:07,480
Um, and I'll just turn it down from...

2033
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:09,000
From my OBS.

2034
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:10,360
Might be easier.

2035
01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:13,120
Alright, before I play...

2036
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:15,020
Give me a sec, I need to grab tissues.

2037
01:23:15,020 --> 01:23:16,680
Cause I need to blow my nose.

2038
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:17,380
I'll be right back.

2039
01:23:33,670 --> 01:23:34,870
Alright, I got it.

2040
01:23:35,030 --> 01:23:35,850
It was like next to me.

2041
01:23:36,490 --> 01:23:37,870
So, pretty easy to grab.

2042
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:48,340
Alright, I'm ready.

2043
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:51,880
Okay, I fixed that.

2044
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:54,060
Am I done fixing things?

2045
01:23:54,380 --> 01:23:55,540
Oh, wait, what's this?

2046
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:59,100
Okay, so that's where I'm supposed to go.

2047
01:24:00,180 --> 01:24:00,680
And I...

2048
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:01,820
Did I fix it?

2049
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:03,680
Did I save this world?

2050
01:24:04,860 --> 01:24:05,940
I did it.

2051
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:07,520
I'm a hero.

2052
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:09,820
Alright, I should be able to...

2053
01:24:10,340 --> 01:24:11,500
Go for it now.

2054
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,140
I think I fixed the world.

2055
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:13,860
I've been...

2056
01:24:13,860 --> 01:24:14,540
I'm ready...

2057
01:24:14,540 --> 01:24:16,000
I'm ready to start...

2058
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,140
The actual mission.

2059
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:19,360
I'm ready to beat up Oswald.

2060
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:20,520
That's fucking right.

2061
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:21,060
Get back here.

2062
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:22,140
There's a reason why...

2063
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:23,940
There's a reason why...

2064
01:24:23,940 --> 01:24:25,400
Dad abandoned you and kept me.

2065
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:26,780
Yay!

2066
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:30,280
Our hero.

2067
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:35,060
Alright.

2068
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:39,200
Wish this boat ride was a little faster though.

2069
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:43,440
That's right.

2070
01:24:44,180 --> 01:24:45,880
I'm the favorite child.

2071
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:48,800
Well, this ride isn't fixed at all.

2072
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:50,740
Look at those boats jammed in there.

2073
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:52,540
Some are even overturned.

2074
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:54,740
The doors should automatically open.

2075
01:24:54,980 --> 01:24:56,460
But I guess it's broken too.

2076
01:24:58,100 --> 01:25:01,020
There are pipes inside the walls that operate the door locks.

2077
01:25:01,540 --> 01:25:04,700
Leading out those pipes will break the locks and the door should open.

2078
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:08,780
Now that I think of it, the hippos are connected to the door as well.

2079
01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:13,580
Stopping the hippos with paint will bypass the door locks and that would open it too.

2080
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:14,580
Okay, so...

2081
01:25:14,580 --> 01:25:15,960
Obviously, I have to paint.

2082
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:17,360
I have to paint it.

2083
01:25:18,620 --> 01:25:19,220
Okay.

2084
01:25:19,940 --> 01:25:20,900
Because we have to do...

2085
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:21,780
We have to be good.

2086
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:23,800
Because that's the Disney way.

2087
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:28,580
Don't wanna make Mickey into a psychopathic murderer or anything.

2088
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:30,000
Or he destroyed...

2089
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,140
That's actually crazy.

2090
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:34,900
The bad ending is him like fucking destroying this...

2091
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:35,920
This universe.

2092
01:25:38,340 --> 01:25:39,920
That's actually...

2093
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:43,420
But that's no fun, Doki!

2094
01:25:43,940 --> 01:25:44,500
Like...

2095
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:46,840
I'm like, holy shit, Mickey's a psychopath.

2096
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:53,160
I'm not trying to go evil.

2097
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,560
Look over there.

2098
01:25:57,880 --> 01:25:59,080
You did it!

2099
01:25:59,820 --> 01:26:03,280
Mickey becomes a fucking psychopathic murderer.

2100
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:05,940
He's here to fuck destroy your multiverse.

2101
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:08,620
It does sound a little...

2102
01:26:08,620 --> 01:26:09,260
Kinda fun.

2103
01:26:09,900 --> 01:26:10,340
Okay.

2104
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:13,120
But which ending is the best better ending?

2105
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:20,820
Evil Mickey Arc will go hard.

2106
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:28,920
And they didn't want the genocider out.

2107
01:26:29,080 --> 01:26:31,260
They shouldn't have kidnapped Mickey.

2108
01:26:38,970 --> 01:26:42,010
Maybe the one word in the world doesn't get deleted.

2109
01:26:43,770 --> 01:26:44,970
What's that noise?

2110
01:26:46,330 --> 01:26:47,430
That's a whirlpool!

2111
01:26:47,910 --> 01:26:49,030
Stay clear of those!

2112
01:26:49,490 --> 01:26:50,070
Just think.

2113
01:26:50,430 --> 01:26:52,150
We have stayed on the boats too long.

2114
01:26:52,930 --> 01:26:53,310
Uh-oh.

2115
01:26:53,870 --> 01:26:55,730
That creature ahead looks like a sweeper.

2116
01:26:56,390 --> 01:26:57,270
They're in trouble.

2117
01:26:57,990 --> 01:26:59,630
They're cousins of the spiders.

2118
01:26:59,970 --> 01:27:02,150
Are capable of hurling bucketfuls of thinner.

2119
01:27:02,150 --> 01:27:05,790
If you get too close, he'll try to sweep you into the river.

2120
01:27:06,050 --> 01:27:07,410
Hence the name, Sweeper.

2121
01:27:08,150 --> 01:27:08,750
Okay, don't worry.

2122
01:27:09,210 --> 01:27:10,710
I'll force him to be my friend.

2123
01:27:14,130 --> 01:27:14,610
FRIEND!

2124
01:27:17,750 --> 01:27:18,770
I did it.

2125
01:27:19,850 --> 01:27:20,670
Oh my god!

2126
01:27:20,770 --> 01:27:21,830
He helps paint too!

2127
01:27:22,610 --> 01:27:23,090
Nice.

2128
01:27:24,710 --> 01:27:25,150
Alright.

2129
01:27:27,350 --> 01:27:28,430
Oh, did I miss something?

2130
01:27:28,570 --> 01:27:29,250
What did I miss?

2131
01:27:29,450 --> 01:27:29,890
Oh wait!

2132
01:27:30,050 --> 01:27:30,550
The collectible.

2133
01:27:33,130 --> 01:27:33,530
Friendship.

2134
01:27:34,370 --> 01:27:35,830
Aggressively becomes your friend.

2135
01:27:37,990 --> 01:27:38,390
Alright.

2136
01:27:39,290 --> 01:27:39,790
Let's see.

2137
01:27:39,910 --> 01:27:41,010
Where do I go now?

2138
01:27:41,030 --> 01:27:42,030
Oh, do I go in the whirlpool?

2139
01:27:42,950 --> 01:27:43,990
Where else can I go?

2140
01:27:43,990 --> 01:27:44,010
Oh.

2141
01:27:50,310 --> 01:27:51,550
Guys, guys, guys, guys.

2142
01:27:51,870 --> 01:27:52,990
Guys, that was...

2143
01:27:58,570 --> 01:28:00,190
I don't know, I just...

2144
01:28:00,190 --> 01:28:01,390
Oh my god, there's something here.

2145
01:28:03,730 --> 01:28:04,990
I just don't...

2146
01:28:05,710 --> 01:28:06,150
A whole...

2147
01:28:06,150 --> 01:28:07,310
A whole second!

2148
01:28:07,310 --> 01:28:07,970
Goal!

2149
01:28:11,890 --> 01:28:12,810
Much better!

2150
01:28:13,270 --> 01:28:14,590
Gremlins Hyperion!

2151
01:28:14,850 --> 01:28:15,930
Peanut and Habba!

2152
01:28:16,150 --> 01:28:17,470
Are still a cage somewhere.

2153
01:28:17,770 --> 01:28:21,370
Any of us you can help will return the favor at the first opportunity.

2154
01:28:23,270 --> 01:28:24,230
I'm sorry!

2155
01:28:24,550 --> 01:28:25,050
I don't know!

2156
01:28:25,170 --> 01:28:26,030
I saw a hole!

2157
01:28:26,650 --> 01:28:27,370
I was like...

2158
01:28:27,370 --> 01:28:29,130
I think I can survive that.

2159
01:28:29,670 --> 01:28:31,230
I think...

2160
01:28:31,230 --> 01:28:32,890
That's survivable.

2161
01:28:37,310 --> 01:28:37,810
What's that?

2162
01:28:38,150 --> 01:28:39,430
How'd that chest get up here?

2163
01:28:39,690 --> 01:28:41,030
There must be a way...

2164
01:28:41,030 --> 01:28:41,670
To get it.

2165
01:28:42,250 --> 01:28:43,470
Hey guys, thank you for the super chat!

2166
01:28:43,590 --> 01:28:43,790
Thank you!

2167
01:28:43,950 --> 01:28:44,410
Thank you!

2168
01:28:44,950 --> 01:28:46,050
Reminds to subscribe to Doki.

2169
01:28:46,290 --> 01:28:48,450
Like the stream or leave a comment on the VOD YouTube.

2170
01:28:48,910 --> 01:28:51,170
YouTube apparently not acknowledge you as a viewer.

2171
01:28:51,350 --> 01:28:51,990
Oh wait, really?

2172
01:28:52,110 --> 01:28:52,850
I didn't know that.

2173
01:28:54,170 --> 01:28:55,310
I didn't know they like...

2174
01:28:55,310 --> 01:28:56,730
That's fucking dumb though.

2175
01:28:57,070 --> 01:28:58,810
Cause you know, people like to lurk.

2176
01:28:59,550 --> 01:29:01,850
That's stupid that they like, made it so that...

2177
01:29:02,450 --> 01:29:03,690
You have to interact.

2178
01:29:08,330 --> 01:29:09,370
Alright, let's see.

2179
01:29:12,770 --> 01:29:15,150
I mean, it's good for a YouTube for advertisers.

2180
01:29:15,330 --> 01:29:16,510
But some people just want to lurk.

2181
01:29:16,630 --> 01:29:17,790
I mean, I'm a lurker.

2182
01:29:21,890 --> 01:29:22,930
Okay, how do I...

2183
01:29:22,930 --> 01:29:23,990
Okay, we're gonna do this.

2184
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:29,050
Okay, I'll thin this.

2185
01:29:31,230 --> 01:29:32,070
And then...

2186
01:29:32,070 --> 01:29:33,110
I'll do this.

2187
01:29:35,110 --> 01:29:35,950
Thin this.

2188
01:29:36,870 --> 01:29:39,150
How do I get to that one though?

2189
01:29:40,050 --> 01:29:41,410
That one's so far.

2190
01:29:42,910 --> 01:29:44,370
Oh, so if you like...

2191
01:29:44,370 --> 01:29:46,570
Oh, if you like it, then you don't have to worry.

2192
01:29:47,150 --> 01:29:48,330
Oh, that's good.

2193
01:29:48,570 --> 01:29:48,970
I'm glad.

2194
01:29:50,090 --> 01:29:53,110
I mean, I like liking the video won't like pressure you guys to...

2195
01:29:53,850 --> 01:29:55,170
To like comment and stuff.

2196
01:29:55,310 --> 01:29:57,110
Cause if you wanna lurk, that's fine with me.

2197
01:29:57,110 --> 01:30:01,270
As long as you guys watch, have fun, enjoy yourself.

2198
01:30:02,090 --> 01:30:02,910
And let...

2199
01:30:03,830 --> 01:30:06,310
Make sure I don't commit murder on these...

2200
01:30:07,310 --> 01:30:09,570
On these people that live in this world.

2201
01:30:09,870 --> 01:30:11,310
And everything will be fine.

2202
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:17,300
That was not an easy chest to reach.

2203
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:18,020
I'm impressed.

2204
01:30:19,700 --> 01:30:20,000
Okay.

2205
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:21,360
Go this way.

2206
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:25,120
Bruh, it's like Mickey was gonna Thanos...

2207
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:26,960
This universe if I...

2208
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:28,960
If I decided to be a little bad.

2209
01:30:34,890 --> 01:30:35,410
Yay!

2210
01:30:35,650 --> 01:30:36,350
Bronze pin!

2211
01:30:37,290 --> 01:30:37,810
Yippee!

2212
01:30:38,970 --> 01:30:39,490
Okay.

2213
01:30:39,790 --> 01:30:40,390
Let's go this way.

2214
01:30:40,390 --> 01:30:40,970
I fell down.

2215
01:30:41,050 --> 01:30:41,730
Thank you for the five.

2216
01:30:41,890 --> 01:30:42,430
Get the chips.

2217
01:30:42,610 --> 01:30:42,850
Thank you.

2218
01:30:42,990 --> 01:30:43,590
Thank you.

2219
01:30:44,450 --> 01:30:45,890
I appreciate it.

2220
01:30:46,450 --> 01:30:46,890
Wait.

2221
01:30:47,270 --> 01:30:47,650
That's it?

2222
01:30:49,950 --> 01:30:51,910
What else am I supposed to do in this world?

2223
01:30:55,550 --> 01:30:56,910
Oh, maybe the red door.

2224
01:31:00,730 --> 01:31:03,910
My conscience is like, Don't erase them.

2225
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:08,690
Don't accidentally erase the entire world.

2226
01:31:08,690 --> 01:31:10,630
Don't do it, Doki.

2227
01:31:11,030 --> 01:31:12,710
This is Jiminy Cricket here.

2228
01:31:13,890 --> 01:31:15,130
I'm your conscience.

2229
01:31:15,610 --> 01:31:17,250
I'm like, Oh, but it'll be so fun.

2230
01:31:19,010 --> 01:31:20,170
But I could just...

2231
01:31:20,170 --> 01:31:21,910
Oh, I could just do it right now.

2232
01:31:22,970 --> 01:31:24,370
It's just right there.

2233
01:31:28,750 --> 01:31:29,590
Oh, shit.

2234
01:31:29,750 --> 01:31:29,910
Whoops.

2235
01:31:32,830 --> 01:31:33,890
How do I get back?

2236
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:36,490
Oh, this way.

2237
01:31:38,350 --> 01:31:39,530
Oh, fuck.

2238
01:31:39,590 --> 01:31:40,650
I have to do this all over again.

2239
01:31:41,190 --> 01:31:42,950
Just for the little funsies.

2240
01:31:44,310 --> 01:31:44,730
Okay.

2241
01:31:45,270 --> 01:31:45,950
Okay, though.

2242
01:31:46,110 --> 01:31:49,990
But like, how many little oopsie accidents can I do before...

2243
01:31:52,370 --> 01:31:52,790
Okay.

2244
01:31:53,130 --> 01:31:55,190
Do I have to be good all the time?

2245
01:31:55,190 --> 01:31:57,470
Or can I make like, you know, one...

2246
01:31:57,470 --> 01:31:59,030
You know, maybe a little accident.

2247
01:31:59,030 --> 01:32:01,480
Where someone actually disappears.

2248
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:07,050
Like, how many...

2249
01:32:07,050 --> 01:32:09,490
How many oopsies can you have?

2250
01:32:09,850 --> 01:32:10,850
Like, little accidents.

2251
01:32:13,030 --> 01:32:14,430
Alright, friends.

2252
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:19,970
Let's see.

2253
01:32:21,710 --> 01:32:23,670
Some accidental murders.

2254
01:32:24,270 --> 01:32:25,810
I am in your debt.

2255
01:32:26,010 --> 01:32:27,790
I hope you can help my other trapped friends.

2256
01:32:27,970 --> 01:32:31,250
I will express my gratitude when an opportunity presents itself.

2257
01:32:32,050 --> 01:32:33,370
Oh, 75%?

2258
01:32:33,810 --> 01:32:34,470
Okay.

2259
01:32:38,250 --> 01:32:38,910
Wait.

2260
01:32:43,330 --> 01:32:45,590
Surely a few won't hurt, right?

2261
01:32:46,170 --> 01:32:46,410
Sure.

2262
01:32:48,310 --> 01:32:49,710
Just a little treat.

2263
01:32:50,050 --> 01:32:51,150
Just to see how it's like.

2264
01:32:53,310 --> 01:32:54,350
Um, rest...

2265
01:32:54,350 --> 01:32:55,310
Welcome to...

2266
01:32:55,310 --> 01:32:56,950
No, don't do it!

2267
01:32:58,310 --> 01:32:59,970
Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't do it.

2268
01:33:02,910 --> 01:33:05,610
Don't do it.

2269
01:33:05,650 --> 01:33:06,530
Don't do it.

2270
01:33:07,730 --> 01:33:08,290
Don't do it.

2271
01:33:13,670 --> 01:33:14,110
Don't do it.

2272
01:33:14,110 --> 01:33:14,670
Don't do it.

2273
01:33:14,670 --> 01:33:14,730
Don't do it.

2274
01:33:15,510 --> 01:33:16,250
Don't do it.

2275
01:33:16,250 --> 01:33:16,850
Don't do it.

2276
01:33:17,130 --> 01:33:17,170
Don't do it.

2277
01:33:17,170 --> 01:33:17,330
Don't do it.

2278
01:33:19,610 --> 01:33:20,070
Don't do it.

2279
01:33:23,470 --> 01:33:24,250
Don't do it.

2280
01:33:28,990 --> 01:33:29,430
Don't do it.

2281
01:33:30,810 --> 01:33:31,510
Don't do it.

2282
01:33:31,510 --> 01:33:31,570
Don't do it.

2283
01:33:31,570 --> 01:33:31,590
Don't do it.

2284
01:33:31,590 --> 01:33:31,630
Don't do it.

2285
01:33:32,310 --> 01:33:33,150
Don't do it.

2286
01:33:33,830 --> 01:33:34,770
This sentence happens.

2287
01:33:38,650 --> 01:33:40,010
Look at this guy.

2288
01:33:42,870 --> 01:33:43,990
I didn't do anything.

2289
01:33:44,350 --> 01:33:44,970
He fell.

2290
01:33:45,270 --> 01:33:46,170
You guys saw it.

2291
01:33:46,270 --> 01:33:47,110
We both fell.

2292
01:33:47,730 --> 01:33:48,570
We both fell.

2293
01:33:49,550 --> 01:33:50,890
Carp, thank you for the super chat.

2294
01:33:51,010 --> 01:33:51,270
Thank you.

2295
01:33:51,430 --> 01:33:51,910
Thank you.

2296
01:33:52,910 --> 01:33:54,370
Algorithm, maddenated, super.

2297
01:33:54,590 --> 01:33:55,430
Also, it's my birthday today.

2298
01:33:55,510 --> 01:33:57,970
Can I get a happy birthday from my Kami Ocean?

2299
01:33:58,210 --> 01:33:59,370
Of course you can.

2300
01:33:59,810 --> 01:34:01,790
Happy birthday to you.

2301
01:34:01,790 --> 01:34:04,370
Happy birthday to you.

2302
01:34:04,370 --> 01:34:07,970
Happy birthday, dear Vlad.

2303
01:34:09,010 --> 01:34:11,050
Happy birthday to you.

2304
01:34:11,290 --> 01:34:11,470
Yeah!

2305
01:34:12,050 --> 01:34:13,930
There was no murder.

2306
01:34:15,450 --> 01:34:17,630
I didn't do anything.

2307
01:34:18,190 --> 01:34:20,650
He and I both fell.

2308
01:34:20,950 --> 01:34:22,870
And I just couldn't save him, guys.

2309
01:34:22,990 --> 01:34:25,250
I tried so hard.

2310
01:34:25,390 --> 01:34:28,750
I said, Grab my hand, son.

2311
01:34:29,070 --> 01:34:30,870
And he was like, No, father.

2312
01:34:30,870 --> 01:34:32,650
You have to live.

2313
01:34:33,190 --> 01:34:35,590
You have so much more to live for.

2314
01:34:36,190 --> 01:34:37,610
Go live your life.

2315
01:34:38,150 --> 01:34:40,610
And then I was like, No, son!

2316
01:34:42,750 --> 01:34:43,890
And here we are.

2317
01:34:44,230 --> 01:34:45,470
And then here we are.

2318
01:34:46,210 --> 01:34:47,110
Minsa is grateful.

2319
01:34:47,350 --> 01:34:48,430
I'm right behind you.

2320
01:34:48,730 --> 01:34:49,330
Let's go.

2321
01:34:49,330 --> 01:34:49,450
Oh!

2322
01:34:50,270 --> 01:34:52,530
It was... So sad.

2323
01:34:53,430 --> 01:34:55,530
Thoughts and prayers for my...

2324
01:34:55,530 --> 01:34:56,590
My dead son.

2325
01:34:57,670 --> 01:34:59,170
I too am a witness.

2326
01:34:59,390 --> 01:35:02,670
I confirmed that this is precisely what happened.

2327
01:35:05,770 --> 01:35:06,850
Alright, let's see.

2328
01:35:06,870 --> 01:35:07,710
How do I get that?

2329
01:35:09,830 --> 01:35:10,790
Okay, nice.

2330
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:14,890
Woo!

2331
01:35:16,170 --> 01:35:17,170
Okay, nice.

2332
01:35:18,850 --> 01:35:20,250
I'll grab... You know what?

2333
01:35:20,390 --> 01:35:21,670
I can just send that in.

2334
01:35:21,910 --> 01:35:24,310
It's like an instant friendship theme.

2335
01:35:25,650 --> 01:35:28,570
And I can't please get five big booms.

2336
01:35:30,090 --> 01:35:30,490
Um...

2337
01:35:30,490 --> 01:35:31,710
Child, thank you for the super chat.

2338
01:35:31,910 --> 01:35:32,230
Uh...

2339
01:35:32,230 --> 01:35:33,290
Child, thank you for the super chat.

2340
01:35:33,330 --> 01:35:33,550
Thank you.

2341
01:35:33,670 --> 01:35:34,190
Thank you.

2342
01:35:35,190 --> 01:35:39,190
VTuber version of your brain telling you to step off when you're near a really high edge.

2343
01:35:39,490 --> 01:35:40,310
Thank you for the super chat.

2344
01:35:40,410 --> 01:35:40,630
Thank you.

2345
01:35:40,770 --> 01:35:41,290
Thank you.

2346
01:35:41,910 --> 01:35:43,330
I just wanted to go down here.

2347
01:35:45,070 --> 01:35:47,390
I wanna grab this real quick.

2348
01:35:50,730 --> 01:35:51,410
What's this?

2349
01:35:51,750 --> 01:35:52,530
Oh, it's a gear.

2350
01:35:54,190 --> 01:35:54,710
Okay.

2351
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:57,810
Get rid of these ugly dolls.

2352
01:35:58,130 --> 01:35:59,230
Not in my Disneyland.

2353
01:36:00,550 --> 01:36:00,910
Okay, wait.

2354
01:36:01,710 --> 01:36:01,950
Nah.

2355
01:36:02,370 --> 01:36:02,570
Okay.

2356
01:36:03,330 --> 01:36:05,110
It doesn't register as something yet.

2357
01:36:05,790 --> 01:36:07,110
Alright, so I have to go down.

2358
01:36:07,370 --> 01:36:08,430
Here, I assume?

2359
01:36:11,850 --> 01:36:14,030
The sweepers are on a retractable platform.

2360
01:36:17,490 --> 01:36:19,590
Use the valves to drop them onto the thinner.

2361
01:36:19,930 --> 01:36:20,930
And open the doors.

2362
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:26,080
Pencils to the rescue.

2363
01:36:26,300 --> 01:36:28,080
My trusty wrench will clear the road.

2364
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:29,240
Oh my...

2365
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:30,040
Okay, I was gonna say.

2366
01:36:31,300 --> 01:36:32,800
I didn't commit that murder.

2367
01:36:34,620 --> 01:36:35,840
That wasn't me.

2368
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:45,720
Get a return of favor.

2369
01:36:45,980 --> 01:36:46,220
Watch.

2370
01:36:46,380 --> 01:36:47,000
Oh my god.

2371
01:36:47,060 --> 01:36:47,900
I didn't do that.

2372
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:50,640
That wasn't me.

2373
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:52,000
No.

2374
01:36:52,380 --> 01:36:53,700
We all saw him.

2375
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:57,880
He fell in there on his own.

2376
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:01,760
No, I wasn't the one that did the murder this time.

2377
01:37:02,340 --> 01:37:05,020
As in like, I never did any murders at all.

2378
01:37:08,640 --> 01:37:09,780
It was him!

2379
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:10,840
It was him!

2380
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:12,740
He did it!

2381
01:37:18,340 --> 01:37:19,700
Is he friends yet?

2382
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:21,960
He is, right?

2383
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:26,230
Okay.

2384
01:37:26,490 --> 01:37:27,310
We're all friends now.

2385
01:37:27,750 --> 01:37:29,470
You were an accomplice.

2386
01:37:34,380 --> 01:37:35,800
Like, am I...

2387
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:38,040
I feel like I shouldn't activate this.

2388
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:39,760
I clipped that.

2389
01:37:40,340 --> 01:37:42,100
I was just a spectator!

2390
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:47,240
Alright.

2391
01:37:47,700 --> 01:37:48,140
Let's see.

2392
01:37:48,260 --> 01:37:49,740
Wait, how do we get that?

2393
01:37:50,020 --> 01:37:50,200
Oh.

2394
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:53,180
Oh, I see.

2395
01:37:53,340 --> 01:37:55,040
We have to do the...

2396
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:57,260
Wait, no?

2397
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:00,060
Which one was for that one?

2398
01:38:01,060 --> 01:38:02,190
Cause that one...

2399
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:03,060
I assume...

2400
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:04,000
Is...

2401
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:04,460
Oh my god.

2402
01:38:04,540 --> 01:38:06,100
I feel like if I...

2403
01:38:06,100 --> 01:38:06,640
Is this?

2404
01:38:11,020 --> 01:38:11,600
Okay.

2405
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:14,140
Yeah.

2406
01:38:16,260 --> 01:38:18,300
Okay, but how do I use the valve?

2407
01:38:22,050 --> 01:38:22,630
What?

2408
01:38:24,090 --> 01:38:25,770
How would I use the valve?

2409
01:38:26,750 --> 01:38:27,630
Open that.

2410
01:38:28,570 --> 01:38:30,870
You broke him out of his prison.

2411
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:36,120
Okay.

2412
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:36,680
Try the valve.

2413
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:38,100
Here.

2414
01:38:39,140 --> 01:38:41,520
Cause I wanna get this, but...

2415
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:42,840
How can I get that?

2416
01:38:44,120 --> 01:38:45,160
A wall?

2417
01:38:45,700 --> 01:38:46,880
Oh, this wall?

2418
01:38:50,260 --> 01:38:51,480
There's nothing in that wall.

2419
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:53,820
Just a regular wall.

2420
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:56,240
See?

2421
01:38:56,680 --> 01:38:57,700
Oh, shit.

2422
01:39:00,340 --> 01:39:01,020
Nevermind.

2423
01:39:01,380 --> 01:39:03,340
Guys, it wasn't just a regular wall.

2424
01:39:03,340 --> 01:39:03,680
Guys.

2425
01:39:05,320 --> 01:39:06,180
Wait, what?

2426
01:39:06,380 --> 01:39:07,580
But I could've just jumped there.

2427
01:39:10,140 --> 01:39:11,240
Guys, look at that.

2428
01:39:12,580 --> 01:39:14,180
But where do I go after here?

2429
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:16,580
Wait, what?

2430
01:39:18,180 --> 01:39:19,660
What do you do after here?

2431
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:23,920
What?

2432
01:39:28,540 --> 01:39:29,640
I'm just...

2433
01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:30,500
Stuck here.

2434
01:39:33,340 --> 01:39:34,180
Oh my god.

2435
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:35,700
Please, please, please.

2436
01:39:35,860 --> 01:39:36,000
Okay.

2437
01:39:36,460 --> 01:39:36,960
Wait, what?

2438
01:39:39,080 --> 01:39:40,440
I'm so confused.

2439
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:44,880
There's like nothing else here.

2440
01:39:48,660 --> 01:39:50,000
It just goes...

2441
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:52,780
How do I retract that wall, though?

2442
01:39:56,620 --> 01:39:57,160
Eh?

2443
01:39:57,160 --> 01:39:57,200
Okay.

2444
01:40:02,370 --> 01:40:04,790
Oh, I killed the guy that...

2445
01:40:04,790 --> 01:40:04,990
Yeah.

2446
01:40:05,330 --> 01:40:05,810
Me.

2447
01:40:06,950 --> 01:40:07,590
Okay.

2448
01:40:08,130 --> 01:40:09,410
I killed...

2449
01:40:09,410 --> 01:40:09,790
Okay.

2450
01:40:09,970 --> 01:40:11,150
That was not my fault.

2451
01:40:11,650 --> 01:40:13,970
We all saw what happened, guys.

2452
01:40:18,970 --> 01:40:20,150
Why didn't thin that?

2453
01:40:20,550 --> 01:40:22,090
No, you can't thin this.

2454
01:40:23,150 --> 01:40:23,470
See?

2455
01:40:25,650 --> 01:40:26,850
It's not thinable.

2456
01:40:28,210 --> 01:40:29,270
It's so weird.

2457
01:40:30,970 --> 01:40:32,410
Okay, that guy did not help me.

2458
01:40:32,510 --> 01:40:33,870
That guy like, made us worse.

2459
01:40:39,750 --> 01:40:40,710
I can't...

2460
01:40:40,710 --> 01:40:41,410
Dash?

2461
01:40:41,630 --> 01:40:42,230
Is that...

2462
01:40:42,230 --> 01:40:42,890
There's no way.

2463
01:40:42,950 --> 01:40:44,090
There has to be a way to...

2464
01:40:44,090 --> 01:40:44,950
Figure this out.

2465
01:40:48,310 --> 01:40:50,750
Because I can't do any of these parts.

2466
01:40:51,430 --> 01:40:53,810
Toki, why did you kill that guy?

2467
01:40:53,970 --> 01:40:54,990
It wasn't me!

2468
01:40:55,130 --> 01:40:56,150
I swear to god!

2469
01:40:56,390 --> 01:40:57,170
Oh my god!

2470
01:40:57,350 --> 01:40:57,890
Oh, he's safe!

2471
01:40:58,130 --> 01:40:58,310
He's...

2472
01:40:58,310 --> 01:40:58,450
No!

2473
01:41:08,840 --> 01:41:09,780
Oh my gosh!

2474
01:41:10,140 --> 01:41:10,600
No!

2475
01:41:10,780 --> 01:41:11,040
They're kidding!

2476
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:20,900
Guys, I swear to god, it wasn't me.

2477
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:24,520
Guys, I swear to god, it wasn't me.

2478
01:41:24,680 --> 01:41:25,510
Guys, I swear...

2479
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:29,920
I swear to god, I didn't do it.

2480
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:31,180
I...

2481
01:41:31,180 --> 01:41:33,260
It wasn't me, guys!

2482
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:34,240
I swear to god!

2483
01:41:34,520 --> 01:41:35,660
It was just...

2484
01:41:36,940 --> 01:41:38,600
You all saw it!

2485
01:41:38,840 --> 01:41:40,120
You all saw it!

2486
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:45,340
You all saw it!

2487
01:41:45,920 --> 01:41:49,380
It was an accident.

2488
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:50,740
It was an accident.

2489
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:51,560
We all saw...

2490
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:52,540
We all saw...

2491
01:41:52,540 --> 01:41:53,780
He had his airpods on.

2492
01:41:54,860 --> 01:41:55,460
Guys...

2493
01:41:55,460 --> 01:41:57,600
He had his airpods on.

2494
01:41:57,820 --> 01:41:59,620
I tried to save him!

2495
01:42:01,900 --> 01:42:03,100
Oh, now I'm stuck.

2496
01:42:05,640 --> 01:42:07,620
Guys, he had his airpods on.

2497
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:08,360
Guys...

2498
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:10,380
I wanted to save him!

2499
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:11,280
Oh my god.

2500
01:42:13,240 --> 01:42:15,280
I don't think I can do this.

2501
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:19,460
I tried to save him, guys.

2502
01:42:19,620 --> 01:42:20,440
I really did.

2503
01:42:22,020 --> 01:42:22,620
No!

2504
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:32,960
He didn't follow safety regulations.

2505
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:35,020
There's no going back!

2506
01:42:40,590 --> 01:42:41,110
There's no going back!

2507
01:42:41,110 --> 01:42:42,250
Might have to come back.

2508
01:42:42,490 --> 01:42:44,170
And then the guy was like, there's no going back.

2509
01:42:44,570 --> 01:42:44,990
There's no...

2510
01:42:49,430 --> 01:42:51,350
I finally had to shut the steam up.

2511
01:42:51,670 --> 01:42:52,670
The entrance to the...

2512
01:42:52,670 --> 01:42:54,530
Asia boat riders through that door.

2513
01:42:55,070 --> 01:42:57,070
There has to be something around here that can help.

2514
01:42:58,590 --> 01:42:59,150
Okay.

2515
01:43:04,120 --> 01:43:08,800
I don't know exactly how much time this is, so I wanna make sure.

2516
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:10,040
Alright.

2517
01:43:16,030 --> 01:43:16,630
Okay.

2518
01:43:17,930 --> 01:43:19,910
I assume I have to shut everything down.

2519
01:43:20,930 --> 01:43:22,050
In a time manner.

2520
01:43:24,610 --> 01:43:25,430
Oh, hey!

2521
01:43:25,910 --> 01:43:26,430
That's Pete.

2522
01:43:26,930 --> 01:43:27,610
Female Pete.

2523
01:43:28,250 --> 01:43:29,030
Small Pete.

2524
01:43:30,070 --> 01:43:31,110
Mickey Mouse, eh?

2525
01:43:31,390 --> 01:43:33,830
I hear you're in Mr. Goody Two-Shoes.

2526
01:43:34,130 --> 01:43:36,630
Mom, here's your chance to prove it.

2527
01:43:36,810 --> 01:43:39,110
I spent years getting a lot of gremlins.

2528
01:43:39,250 --> 01:43:41,590
Only I have to knock him around on occasion.

2529
01:43:42,950 --> 01:43:45,890
Then the one time I crashed my boat into their village.

2530
01:43:46,090 --> 01:43:48,350
They seem to think I'm some kind of villain.

2531
01:43:48,790 --> 01:43:51,250
Not that I give two hoots what they think.

2532
01:43:51,550 --> 01:43:53,030
But, it was...

2533
01:43:53,030 --> 01:43:53,030
See?

2534
01:43:53,150 --> 01:43:54,010
It was an accident.

2535
01:43:54,210 --> 01:43:54,390
See?

2536
01:43:54,450 --> 01:43:55,290
He knows what's up.

2537
01:43:55,670 --> 01:43:56,910
Pete's the most reliable guy.

2538
01:43:57,170 --> 01:43:57,970
He's a good father.

2539
01:43:58,350 --> 01:44:00,410
And my ship's logs will prove it.

2540
01:44:00,750 --> 01:44:03,430
Those little monsters will let me near the wreck together, though.

2541
01:44:03,670 --> 01:44:03,930
Hmm?

2542
01:44:04,370 --> 01:44:05,410
I bet they'll let you.

2543
01:44:05,950 --> 01:44:09,250
Find that log from my ship, so we can put this to rest.

2544
01:44:09,450 --> 01:44:11,150
And I can get back to work.

2545
01:44:11,750 --> 01:44:12,870
See ya soon.

2546
01:44:13,050 --> 01:44:13,570
Or sooner.

2547
01:44:13,910 --> 01:44:15,150
If you know what's good for ya.

2548
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:19,920
See, guys?

2549
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:21,380
Pete knows what's up.

2550
01:44:21,940 --> 01:44:23,700
We all know Pete is very...

2551
01:44:23,700 --> 01:44:24,420
...reliable.

2552
01:44:26,580 --> 01:44:27,840
Good ol' Pete.

2553
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:31,180
Hear me out.

2554
01:44:33,060 --> 01:44:33,900
Oh, shit.

2555
01:44:35,780 --> 01:44:38,180
I saw a gremlin bra on top of the pagoda.

2556
01:44:39,400 --> 01:44:41,480
Perhaps he can tell us how to follow Oswald.

2557
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:45,580
Bra might also have a grasp on whatever small Pete was complaining about.

2558
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:47,540
That's Oswald again.

2559
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:49,260
How did he get over there?

2560
01:44:49,780 --> 01:44:51,240
Surely didn't lock that door.

2561
01:44:51,640 --> 01:44:52,720
Stupid Oswald.

2562
01:44:53,930 --> 01:44:54,800
I'm gonna get him.

2563
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:58,000
Yeah, he's just misunderstood, guys.

2564
01:44:58,660 --> 01:45:00,060
Pete's just misunderstood.

2565
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:05,040
Alright, let's get him out.

2566
01:45:05,200 --> 01:45:05,840
Bring him out.

2567
01:45:06,440 --> 01:45:07,460
Now we're friends.

2568
01:45:08,140 --> 01:45:08,480
Yay!

2569
01:45:10,120 --> 01:45:11,740
Oh wait, there's some items here.

2570
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:13,640
I want that.

2571
01:45:14,060 --> 01:45:14,680
Tickets!

2572
01:45:15,460 --> 01:45:16,920
What do I do with these tickets?

2573
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:19,520
Alright.

2574
01:45:20,240 --> 01:45:21,120
Let's see.

2575
01:45:22,220 --> 01:45:22,740
Yay!

2576
01:45:22,780 --> 01:45:24,060
We're friends now.

2577
01:45:25,620 --> 01:45:26,140
See?

2578
01:45:26,340 --> 01:45:26,960
Look at that.

2579
01:45:27,220 --> 01:45:29,980
If I committed murder, why would they want to be friends with me?

2580
01:45:30,300 --> 01:45:34,220
If I, quote on quote, killed their other friends.

2581
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:38,860
If you think about it.

2582
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:40,400
Checkmate.

2583
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:50,380
Oh well, I guess you're not a partner of small Pete.

2584
01:45:52,140 --> 01:45:53,480
They didn't know.

2585
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:55,080
They don't want to...

2586
01:45:55,080 --> 01:45:56,900
They don't want to be next.

2587
01:45:57,420 --> 01:45:59,980
The boats will take you to the island, but not much further.

2588
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:01,660
Don't stay on too long.

2589
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:04,320
There's some machinery over there.

2590
01:46:04,440 --> 01:46:06,140
I happen to know what it does.

2591
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:08,580
It controls something called a fire bridge.

2592
01:46:08,580 --> 01:46:10,180
Here's the name for a bridge.

2593
01:46:10,420 --> 01:46:12,340
That is your key to escape here.

2594
01:46:12,640 --> 01:46:14,920
The really tricky part is getting to the machinery.

2595
01:46:15,480 --> 01:46:17,040
You're gonna face some challenges there.

2596
01:46:17,380 --> 01:46:18,700
Alright, I can parkour that.

2597
01:46:20,760 --> 01:46:21,720
Oh, nice.

2598
01:46:22,120 --> 01:46:23,800
Oh, can I become friends with him yet?

2599
01:46:24,160 --> 01:46:25,900
No, but I can...

2600
01:46:25,900 --> 01:46:27,100
No, I can't.

2601
01:46:27,340 --> 01:46:29,560
I was gonna shoot my goo over there.

2602
01:46:30,240 --> 01:46:31,760
Alright, we gotta go this way then.

2603
01:46:34,240 --> 01:46:38,120
Okay, we'll go this way first.

2604
01:46:38,580 --> 01:46:40,920
And then destroy these tickets.

2605
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:46,480
Don't worry, I'll help you very soon, little guy.

2606
01:46:47,300 --> 01:46:49,340
Just gotta destroy these creepy dolls.

2607
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:51,580
And then I'll free you.

2608
01:46:52,900 --> 01:46:53,380
Okay.

2609
01:46:54,020 --> 01:46:54,440
Alright.

2610
01:46:54,440 --> 01:46:54,540
Alright.

2611
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:57,480
Looks like the whirlpool sank the boat you're on.

2612
01:46:57,740 --> 01:46:58,620
You can fix it.

2613
01:46:58,760 --> 01:46:59,980
So you can reach the gears.

2614
01:47:00,300 --> 01:47:02,600
But those dolls behind the big walls are complicated.

2615
01:47:03,860 --> 01:47:05,660
It's either just paying me to do it.

2616
01:47:05,860 --> 01:47:08,140
Just because I'm free does not mean my wrench...

2617
01:47:08,140 --> 01:47:09,160
See, I told... Look at that!

2618
01:47:09,540 --> 01:47:09,980
Look at that.

2619
01:47:10,100 --> 01:47:12,080
Fucking handyman trying to scam me right now.

2620
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:14,680
Its help requires a small fee.

2621
01:47:15,220 --> 01:47:15,900
Alright, yeah.

2622
01:47:15,980 --> 01:47:16,400
Fix it.

2623
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:20,600
I'll endeavor to provide 100% satisfaction, sir.

2624
01:47:21,120 --> 01:47:21,520
Look at that.

2625
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:21,720
See?

2626
01:47:21,900 --> 01:47:23,380
He charges for his work.

2627
01:47:27,860 --> 01:47:28,440
Alright.

2628
01:47:29,180 --> 01:47:30,900
Just gonna apply a bit of wrench action here.

2629
01:47:30,900 --> 01:47:30,980
Yeah?

2630
01:47:33,820 --> 01:47:36,200
Now, it should be working to your satisfaction.

2631
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:39,360
Wait, which one did you...

2632
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:39,860
Prepare?

2633
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:42,760
Already lost.

2634
01:47:43,560 --> 01:47:44,780
Oh, it's over here.

2635
01:47:44,820 --> 01:47:45,260
I see it.

2636
01:47:45,620 --> 01:47:46,980
I was like, what did he do?

2637
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:49,120
What did you do?

2638
01:47:50,840 --> 01:47:52,280
How do I fix it then?

2639
01:47:53,580 --> 01:47:55,000
What the fuck am I supposed to...

2640
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:55,500
Bro, what?

2641
01:47:56,600 --> 01:47:57,980
How am I supposed to fix this?

2642
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:00,460
Oh my god.

2643
01:48:01,900 --> 01:48:03,760
Oh fuck, I thought I was aiming.

2644
01:48:06,920 --> 01:48:07,880
What are you doing?

2645
01:48:09,140 --> 01:48:10,720
I have to go through here.

2646
01:48:11,200 --> 01:48:11,700
Wait, do I?

2647
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:13,660
Bro, I have to go...

2648
01:48:13,660 --> 01:48:14,540
Bro, bro, stop!

2649
01:48:14,780 --> 01:48:15,020
Stop!

2650
01:48:15,320 --> 01:48:15,700
Stop!

2651
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:18,040
This is where I have to go!

2652
01:48:20,380 --> 01:48:21,480
He's like, I...

2653
01:48:21,480 --> 01:48:22,700
I'm your friend now.

2654
01:48:22,860 --> 01:48:24,500
Let me block the exit.

2655
01:48:27,980 --> 01:48:29,440
Okay, it's down here.

2656
01:48:31,100 --> 01:48:31,700
Alright.

2657
01:48:32,780 --> 01:48:34,540
Oh, so that's what he did.

2658
01:48:36,740 --> 01:48:37,980
Pretty old though.

2659
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:38,780
Okay.

2660
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:42,720
Okay, it's time.

2661
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:44,620
Okay, it's five seconds.

2662
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:46,580
They're helping you.

2663
01:48:47,380 --> 01:48:49,160
They're just trying to help.

2664
01:48:49,620 --> 01:48:52,600
Okay, I just want to know how long it was before I do it.

2665
01:48:54,580 --> 01:48:55,880
Oh shit, ow.

2666
01:48:56,600 --> 01:48:57,180
Oh wait.

2667
01:48:57,700 --> 01:48:58,360
Oh my god.

2668
01:48:58,540 --> 01:48:59,560
Okay, I can...

2669
01:48:59,560 --> 01:49:01,400
I have to get rid of this.

2670
01:49:03,780 --> 01:49:04,360
Okay.

2671
01:49:08,030 --> 01:49:08,610
Okay.

2672
01:49:12,430 --> 01:49:13,350
Oh shit!

2673
01:49:16,310 --> 01:49:17,710
Oh my god, come on.

2674
01:49:22,190 --> 01:49:23,110
Okay, nice.

2675
01:49:24,690 --> 01:49:26,830
Let's go check out that red chest over here.

2676
01:49:27,010 --> 01:49:28,130
I wonder what it could be.

2677
01:49:30,070 --> 01:49:31,090
What did I unlock?

2678
01:49:31,310 --> 01:49:31,970
Where am I?

2679
01:49:32,990 --> 01:49:34,390
Okay, I gotta fix this.

2680
01:49:35,250 --> 01:49:37,050
So it doesn't look like I...

2681
01:49:37,050 --> 01:49:37,990
did something wrong.

2682
01:49:40,030 --> 01:49:40,370
Okay.

2683
01:49:41,110 --> 01:49:42,610
I can get rid of this.

2684
01:49:43,650 --> 01:49:44,570
And then...

2685
01:49:44,570 --> 01:49:45,450
jump through here.

2686
01:49:46,390 --> 01:49:47,290
And then...

2687
01:49:47,290 --> 01:49:47,890
Parkour!

2688
01:49:49,650 --> 01:49:50,210
FRIEND!

2689
01:49:51,890 --> 01:49:52,790
There we go.

2690
01:49:54,650 --> 01:49:55,110
Yay!

2691
01:49:55,770 --> 01:49:56,590
Force friendship!

2692
01:49:57,170 --> 01:49:57,730
Let's...

2693
01:49:57,730 --> 01:49:58,110
GO!

2694
01:50:02,890 --> 01:50:03,370
There we go.

2695
01:50:03,430 --> 01:50:04,110
I got the chest.

2696
01:50:05,770 --> 01:50:06,890
My friend...

2697
01:50:07,690 --> 01:50:09,310
My friend goop.

2698
01:50:09,690 --> 01:50:10,250
Yay!

2699
01:50:10,570 --> 01:50:11,090
Bronze pin.

2700
01:50:11,330 --> 01:50:11,750
Let's go.

2701
01:50:12,290 --> 01:50:12,890
My friend...

2702
01:50:12,890 --> 01:50:14,390
It's like the Care Bear stair.

2703
01:50:15,230 --> 01:50:17,210
One, two, three, four.

2704
01:50:17,690 --> 01:50:18,530
What is it?

2705
01:50:18,630 --> 01:50:20,410
How does the Care Bear stair go again?

2706
01:50:20,410 --> 01:50:21,810
Ha ha ha.

2707
01:50:21,830 --> 01:50:22,890
Care Bear stair!

2708
01:50:25,330 --> 01:50:26,650
My friend goop.

2709
01:50:27,410 --> 01:50:28,610
It's like Care Bear stair.

2710
01:50:30,050 --> 01:50:31,570
I'm giving them friendship.

2711
01:50:33,470 --> 01:50:34,110
Okay.

2712
01:50:36,310 --> 01:50:37,690
Okay, that's just fine.

2713
01:50:39,350 --> 01:50:40,110
What is that?

2714
01:50:43,650 --> 01:50:45,370
There's a chest over here.

2715
01:50:45,650 --> 01:50:46,650
But I didn't get the chairs.

2716
01:50:48,610 --> 01:50:49,350
Care Bears.

2717
01:50:49,350 --> 01:50:49,590
Care Bears.

2718
01:50:49,710 --> 01:50:50,410
Count down.

2719
01:50:50,870 --> 01:50:52,550
Four, three, two, one.

2720
01:50:52,770 --> 01:50:52,970
Yeah!

2721
01:50:53,550 --> 01:50:54,530
That's basically it.

2722
01:50:54,590 --> 01:50:55,610
I just did that!

2723
01:50:59,870 --> 01:51:00,950
What do I do now?

2724
01:51:04,830 --> 01:51:06,210
Oh, I didn't go that way yet.

2725
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:10,980
I had to do something here.

2726
01:51:11,120 --> 01:51:11,260
Yeah.

2727
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:12,880
I was like, oh, I didn't go this way.

2728
01:51:13,580 --> 01:51:14,380
Oh, hey.

2729
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:15,020
Achievement.

2730
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:16,460
Or, collectible.

2731
01:51:20,120 --> 01:51:21,480
Okay, uh...

2732
01:51:21,480 --> 01:51:23,080
Okay, that.

2733
01:51:23,620 --> 01:51:24,600
Okay, that.

2734
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:26,640
I got rid of this.

2735
01:51:28,640 --> 01:51:30,080
Then I climbed this.

2736
01:51:31,100 --> 01:51:32,480
Oh shit, what?

2737
01:51:33,680 --> 01:51:34,800
What did I do?

2738
01:51:35,060 --> 01:51:36,120
Oh my god, that's a dragon!

2739
01:51:37,660 --> 01:51:38,340
Oh shit!

2740
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:41,060
Oh, that's so cool!

2741
01:51:44,860 --> 01:51:46,440
We will be friends.

2742
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:47,660
Do not resist!

2743
01:51:49,080 --> 01:51:49,860
Okay, nice.

2744
01:51:50,020 --> 01:51:51,120
I can go to the tempo now.

2745
01:51:54,480 --> 01:51:55,720
Where does this go?

2746
01:51:59,190 --> 01:52:00,930
Where the fuck does this go, though?

2747
01:52:06,500 --> 01:52:07,000
What?

2748
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:14,460
Oh, it goes straight to this, but...

2749
01:52:14,460 --> 01:52:15,840
I can't unlock that yet.

2750
01:52:17,100 --> 01:52:19,040
Okay, I was like, so confused.

2751
01:52:19,180 --> 01:52:19,580
I was like, what?

2752
01:52:20,540 --> 01:52:21,860
Where's the switch for that?

2753
01:52:26,120 --> 01:52:27,740
Oh, is that a good dragon?

2754
01:52:27,980 --> 01:52:29,360
Oh, there's a bad dragon?

2755
01:52:32,060 --> 01:52:34,740
Wait, that dragon actually changes too?

2756
01:52:34,860 --> 01:52:37,660
Because I've been a good person this entire game.

2757
01:52:37,660 --> 01:52:38,720
I mean...

2758
01:52:40,780 --> 01:52:42,160
El, thank you for the super chat.

2759
01:52:42,260 --> 01:52:43,100
Thank you, thank you.

2760
01:52:44,620 --> 01:52:44,980
Um...

2761
01:52:44,980 --> 01:52:46,540
Hi Toki, I think I need to rest.

2762
01:52:46,660 --> 01:52:47,980
Since I feel a migraine coming.

2763
01:52:48,160 --> 01:52:49,360
Oh, I hope you get better soon.

2764
01:52:49,900 --> 01:52:50,540
It's okay.

2765
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:51,360
It's fine.

2766
01:52:51,620 --> 01:52:53,000
I hope you get better soon.

2767
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:54,160
Your health is much more important.

2768
01:52:58,760 --> 01:53:01,340
I paid the guy to fix a fucking gear?

2769
01:53:01,600 --> 01:53:03,120
And I don't even know what he fixed.

2770
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:03,800
Like...

2771
01:53:03,800 --> 01:53:05,100
What did he do?

2772
01:53:05,740 --> 01:53:07,080
I don't even know.

2773
01:53:07,620 --> 01:53:09,760
I don't even know what he did for me.

2774
01:53:12,280 --> 01:53:13,400
I reached the exit.

2775
01:53:13,640 --> 01:53:15,300
But how come the door doesn't open?

2776
01:53:15,940 --> 01:53:18,300
Try getting up to this level on the other side of the door.

2777
01:53:18,780 --> 01:53:20,220
The fact is, they give us a super chat.

2778
01:53:20,360 --> 01:53:21,080
Thank you.

2779
01:53:21,160 --> 01:53:21,940
Here's some money.

2780
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:22,500
Thank you.

2781
01:53:22,640 --> 01:53:23,440
I like money.

2782
01:53:27,330 --> 01:53:28,730
Okay, there's that.

2783
01:53:36,060 --> 01:53:37,340
And then there's that.

2784
01:53:37,620 --> 01:53:38,560
We got the clouds.

2785
01:53:39,760 --> 01:53:41,460
I don't know how to get up there though.

2786
01:53:42,140 --> 01:53:42,660
Oh, okay.

2787
01:53:42,780 --> 01:53:43,520
Now it comes up.

2788
01:53:44,340 --> 01:53:44,700
Okay.

2789
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:47,520
I was like, how do I get up?

2790
01:53:49,960 --> 01:53:50,920
Oh, levitating.

2791
01:53:52,180 --> 01:53:54,400
Oh, I don't like the faces they're making.

2792
01:53:56,340 --> 01:53:56,940
Oh.

2793
01:53:57,820 --> 01:53:58,420
Parkour.

2794
01:54:02,300 --> 01:54:02,900
Oh!

2795
01:54:03,380 --> 01:54:03,940
Nice!

2796
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:05,220
I unlocked Steamboat Willie!

2797
01:54:06,120 --> 01:54:06,840
Did it!

2798
01:54:06,920 --> 01:54:07,720
The door is opening!

2799
01:54:08,300 --> 01:54:09,440
Is there anything else up here?

2800
01:54:10,980 --> 01:54:12,900
Oh, there's bad people over there.

2801
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:15,980
How do I get there?

2802
01:54:15,980 --> 01:54:19,160
I wanna say hi to the bad people.

2803
01:54:20,940 --> 01:54:22,680
And make them my friends.

2804
01:54:25,600 --> 01:54:26,400
Alright.

2805
01:54:27,800 --> 01:54:29,020
Let's see.

2806
01:54:30,500 --> 01:54:32,240
Don't worry, I'm coming over.

2807
01:54:32,740 --> 01:54:34,680
You will become my friend!

2808
01:54:46,090 --> 01:54:47,250
Oh, shit!

2809
01:54:48,790 --> 01:54:49,590
Friend!

2810
01:54:49,590 --> 01:54:49,930
Friend!

2811
01:54:52,570 --> 01:54:53,490
That's right!

2812
01:54:54,130 --> 01:54:55,470
Do not resist!

2813
01:54:57,830 --> 01:54:59,010
Oh my god, bro!

2814
01:54:59,110 --> 01:54:59,670
Stop hitting him!

2815
01:54:59,870 --> 01:55:00,430
He's friend!

2816
01:55:04,570 --> 01:55:05,170
Okay.

2817
01:55:05,470 --> 01:55:06,350
I don't know what this does.

2818
01:55:07,470 --> 01:55:08,290
Oh, shit!

2819
01:55:15,830 --> 01:55:17,030
It was an accident!

2820
01:55:17,130 --> 01:55:17,190
It was an accident!

2821
01:55:17,190 --> 01:55:18,090
You all saw that, right?

2822
01:55:18,490 --> 01:55:19,490
That was...

2823
01:55:20,430 --> 01:55:21,030
Guys!

2824
01:55:21,270 --> 01:55:22,250
That was an accident!

2825
01:55:22,790 --> 01:55:23,990
He and we...

2826
01:55:23,990 --> 01:55:25,150
It was a work...

2827
01:55:25,150 --> 01:55:28,390
Zero days since the last work place accident!

2828
01:55:28,650 --> 01:55:29,170
No!

2829
01:55:29,350 --> 01:55:30,450
I didn't kill him!

2830
01:55:30,610 --> 01:55:31,290
I swear!

2831
01:55:31,670 --> 01:55:34,130
It was like final destination, guys!

2832
01:55:34,410 --> 01:55:35,290
His death was...

2833
01:55:35,290 --> 01:55:37,310
His death was already decided!

2834
01:55:39,550 --> 01:55:40,690
Oh my god!

2835
01:55:41,850 --> 01:55:44,490
Am I glad to be free of that cage?

2836
01:55:45,010 --> 01:55:46,050
Cramps one leg!

2837
01:55:46,210 --> 01:55:47,350
I can tell you!

2838
01:55:47,730 --> 01:55:49,790
It was all Osha's fault!

2839
01:55:54,190 --> 01:55:55,170
Oh, we already...

2840
01:55:55,170 --> 01:55:56,550
Wait, we already reached him, though.

2841
01:55:58,970 --> 01:56:00,590
Let's let anyone ask...

2842
01:56:00,590 --> 01:56:01,670
Let me know that I'm...

2843
01:56:01,670 --> 01:56:02,030
Guys!

2844
01:56:02,310 --> 01:56:02,690
Guys!

2845
01:56:02,790 --> 01:56:04,310
We all saw it, right?

2846
01:56:05,210 --> 01:56:07,290
His death was already decided!

2847
01:56:09,570 --> 01:56:10,870
It was...

2848
01:56:10,870 --> 01:56:11,690
It was...

2849
01:56:11,690 --> 01:56:13,750
It was a final destination death!

2850
01:56:14,190 --> 01:56:15,420
That's why...

2851
01:56:16,170 --> 01:56:19,510
One life in exchange for his freedom!

2852
01:56:23,290 --> 01:56:25,190
I swear to god!

2853
01:56:30,740 --> 01:56:32,400
Let's grab that!

2854
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,560
I got everything here!

2855
01:56:39,200 --> 01:56:41,180
What was the point of needing this area?

2856
01:56:45,140 --> 01:56:48,140
Oh, I guess I could've picked which one I wanted to do!

2857
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:51,680
Okay, but I wanted to do left or right!

2858
01:56:53,420 --> 01:56:56,220
It was a necessary sacrifice!

2859
01:56:59,240 --> 01:57:02,620
Yeah, cause I'm like thinking, how do I get that chest over there?

2860
01:57:06,780 --> 01:57:08,040
Alright, let's go!

2861
01:57:08,240 --> 01:57:08,860
Let's jump in!

2862
01:57:09,280 --> 01:57:11,340
Yeah, I'm ready to go in the world of gremlins!

2863
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:13,920
Rebellions!

2864
01:57:14,180 --> 01:57:14,520
Thank you!

2865
01:57:14,660 --> 01:57:16,240
Welcome to the tomato farm!

2866
01:57:16,720 --> 01:57:16,820
Welcome!

2867
01:57:17,060 --> 01:57:17,240
Welcome!

2868
01:57:19,580 --> 01:57:20,600
Yo, what's in here?

2869
01:57:20,920 --> 01:57:22,000
Oh, I knew it!

2870
01:57:22,760 --> 01:57:23,320
Oh, nice!

2871
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:23,720
Money!

2872
01:57:37,500 --> 01:57:38,320
Oh my god!

2873
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:39,920
I love the classic steamboat movie!

2874
01:57:40,700 --> 01:57:41,200
Oh look!

2875
01:57:41,360 --> 01:57:42,080
There's evil Pete!

2876
01:57:42,400 --> 01:57:43,520
I mean, good Pete!

2877
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:44,240
You know?

2878
01:57:44,420 --> 01:57:45,460
Cause we're good friends!

2879
01:57:48,640 --> 01:57:50,280
Alright, I wanna go up though!

2880
01:57:52,020 --> 01:57:53,020
It's good Pete!

2881
01:57:53,220 --> 01:57:54,440
Cause he understands me!

2882
01:57:56,140 --> 01:57:57,000
What does this do?

2883
01:58:00,680 --> 01:58:01,160
Wait...

2884
01:58:01,160 --> 01:58:02,160
Does it pull me up?

2885
01:58:03,180 --> 01:58:04,240
Oh yeah, it does!

2886
01:58:04,480 --> 01:58:04,720
Nice!

2887
01:58:08,700 --> 01:58:09,180
Okay...

2888
01:58:09,180 --> 01:58:10,280
Go this way...

2889
01:58:10,860 --> 01:58:12,100
I was like, oh my god!

2890
01:58:12,260 --> 01:58:13,320
It's like Bendy!

2891
01:58:14,280 --> 01:58:15,980
You shut your mouth right now!

2892
01:58:29,670 --> 01:58:31,430
Okay, wait, I need to go...

2893
01:58:32,270 --> 01:58:32,710
Wait...

2894
01:58:32,710 --> 01:58:33,530
Oh, I need to go up here!

2895
01:58:33,970 --> 01:58:34,730
Is this...

2896
01:58:34,730 --> 01:58:35,390
Oh my god!

2897
01:58:35,510 --> 01:58:36,130
I can't believe!

2898
01:58:36,430 --> 01:58:39,290
Epic Mickey took inspiration from Bendy, guys!

2899
01:58:39,710 --> 01:58:39,930
Alright!

2900
01:58:41,990 --> 01:58:43,690
Okay, I have to go this way then.

2901
01:58:45,470 --> 01:58:46,310
Alright, this way.

2902
01:58:48,350 --> 01:58:50,090
Oh, I already played Ink Machine.

2903
01:58:50,410 --> 01:58:51,550
Unfortunately, the archives...

2904
01:58:52,010 --> 01:58:54,370
I mean, you can still find the archives of it, but...

2905
01:58:54,370 --> 01:58:54,830
Yeah.

2906
01:58:55,150 --> 01:58:58,750
I already played Bendy and the Ink Machine, and also...

2907
01:58:59,570 --> 01:59:00,210
Uh...

2908
01:59:00,210 --> 01:59:00,770
Uh...

2909
01:59:00,770 --> 01:59:01,290
The sequel.

2910
01:59:03,310 --> 01:59:04,310
Okay, nice.

2911
01:59:05,410 --> 01:59:05,810
Yay!

2912
01:59:06,130 --> 01:59:06,290
Yay!

2913
01:59:06,770 --> 01:59:07,430
The film!

2914
01:59:08,070 --> 01:59:08,750
Part 1?

2915
01:59:08,930 --> 01:59:10,710
Where the fuck is part 2?

2916
01:59:14,970 --> 01:59:16,330
I can't even...

2917
01:59:16,330 --> 01:59:16,750
What?

2918
01:59:20,690 --> 01:59:21,130
Alright.

2919
01:59:23,170 --> 01:59:24,890
I don't know where part 2 is.

2920
01:59:25,410 --> 01:59:26,490
Is part 2 even here?

2921
01:59:27,330 --> 01:59:28,930
Or am I gonna go back to Steamboat?

2922
01:59:29,090 --> 01:59:29,930
Oh, fuck it, let's go.

2923
01:59:30,630 --> 01:59:32,210
You're in Lost Media!

2924
01:59:32,970 --> 01:59:34,050
Yeah, I'm ready to enter.

2925
01:59:37,230 --> 01:59:38,690
Paint for the Paint God!

2926
01:59:38,930 --> 01:59:39,110
Boom!

2927
01:59:39,250 --> 01:59:40,110
Thank you for the Super Chat!

2928
01:59:40,250 --> 01:59:40,530
Thank you!

2929
01:59:40,730 --> 01:59:41,250
Thank you!

2930
01:59:46,460 --> 01:59:46,900
Alright.

2931
01:59:47,320 --> 01:59:48,960
Now I'm in the Gremlin world.

2932
01:59:51,800 --> 01:59:53,020
I'm gonna steal their money.

2933
01:59:54,040 --> 01:59:54,540
Oh, it's...

2934
01:59:54,540 --> 01:59:55,820
The world is pretty ugly.

2935
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:57,780
This is our village, but it's been a...

2936
01:59:57,780 --> 01:59:59,340
Yeah, I was gonna say, the world...

2937
01:59:59,700 --> 02:00:01,260
Definitely does not look the best.

2938
02:00:01,260 --> 02:00:04,320
Our wonderful village tower and windmill are ruined!

2939
02:00:05,020 --> 02:00:06,300
Pipes leaking everywhere!

2940
02:00:06,900 --> 02:00:09,680
The pipes here used to power the entire village!

2941
02:00:10,040 --> 02:00:11,600
We gotta get them patched up!

2942
02:00:12,040 --> 02:00:12,780
My house!

2943
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:14,280
What happened to it?

2944
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:17,300
That thinner is ruining my lovely house!

2945
02:00:17,720 --> 02:00:19,600
Please, save our village!

2946
02:00:21,020 --> 02:00:22,180
Alright, save...

2947
02:00:22,180 --> 02:00:25,540
Okay, good thing they don't know I was the reason why the village just fucked up.

2948
02:00:26,280 --> 02:00:28,260
I was the OG problem!

2949
02:00:28,600 --> 02:00:29,880
But they don't know!

2950
02:00:32,480 --> 02:00:33,760
Here, I'll fix that.

2951
02:00:35,140 --> 02:00:35,500
Hello!

2952
02:00:37,020 --> 02:00:39,060
The pipes here used to power the entire village!

2953
02:00:39,200 --> 02:00:40,480
We got to get them patched up!

2954
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:41,600
Please, save...

2955
02:00:41,600 --> 02:00:42,880
Don't worry, I'll be a hero!

2956
02:00:43,160 --> 02:00:45,200
You don't know it was me that caused all this!

2957
02:00:45,980 --> 02:00:47,540
So you'll think I'm the hero!

2958
02:00:49,260 --> 02:00:50,720
Okay, I'll get that.

2959
02:00:52,780 --> 02:00:53,660
And then...

2960
02:00:55,620 --> 02:00:58,560
Yeah, I'm the problem, but I also sell the miracle solution.

2961
02:00:59,020 --> 02:01:02,080
It's like I poison the water, and I'll be like, Don't worry, guys!

2962
02:01:02,220 --> 02:01:03,700
I have the solution for all of that!

2963
02:01:05,400 --> 02:01:08,180
I hold the only antidote to the poisoned water!

2964
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:10,300
What a coincidence, guys!

2965
02:01:11,600 --> 02:01:12,460
I patched up now!

2966
02:01:12,600 --> 02:01:13,140
Nice work!

2967
02:01:13,420 --> 02:01:14,640
Look for the valve controls!

2968
02:01:14,840 --> 02:01:15,720
Spin them right off!

2969
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:16,880
Okay, to this one.

2970
02:01:21,440 --> 02:01:22,160
I'm a hero!

2971
02:01:26,280 --> 02:01:28,020
It's like, look, it's like you fixed it!

2972
02:01:28,120 --> 02:01:29,340
Now you can fix my house!

2973
02:01:30,180 --> 02:01:30,880
And look!

2974
02:01:31,260 --> 02:01:32,960
Those rides are working again, too!

2975
02:01:35,480 --> 02:01:37,040
We can use them to...

2976
02:01:37,740 --> 02:01:38,180
Uh...

2977
02:01:38,180 --> 02:01:39,080
Get around the village!

2978
02:01:39,320 --> 02:01:41,380
It's tricky, but I have confidence in you!

2979
02:01:42,440 --> 02:01:44,280
Thank you for fixing those pipes!

2980
02:01:44,760 --> 02:01:46,540
Can you fix the village tower as well?

2981
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,480
There is a pump up there that can operate the gate!

2982
02:01:53,540 --> 02:01:54,220
All right.

2983
02:01:54,420 --> 02:01:55,200
Yeah, we can fix that.

2984
02:01:57,660 --> 02:01:59,060
What's he doing here?

2985
02:01:59,740 --> 02:02:01,020
See what happened here?

2986
02:02:01,340 --> 02:02:05,160
Small P was showing up and crashed his boat into our village!

2987
02:02:05,680 --> 02:02:08,900
Pete says he didn't do it on purpose, but I don't believe him!

2988
02:02:09,100 --> 02:02:11,880
He's been such a bully in the past, you know!

2989
02:02:12,240 --> 02:02:17,600
Until I see if evidence that really was an accident, we gremlins will keep him out of the village!

2990
02:02:17,600 --> 02:02:18,460
Oh, come on!

2991
02:02:18,580 --> 02:02:19,600
It's a little oopsie!

2992
02:02:19,780 --> 02:02:21,840
Everyone has little oopsies, guys!

2993
02:02:24,240 --> 02:02:25,280
Right, guys?

2994
02:02:25,860 --> 02:02:27,960
Just a little oopsie!

2995
02:02:30,560 --> 02:02:32,260
Bush, thank you for the super chat!

2996
02:02:32,620 --> 02:02:33,980
Welcome to tomato farm!

2997
02:02:34,120 --> 02:02:34,640
Welcome, welcome!

2998
02:02:37,100 --> 02:02:38,700
Accidents happen, everyone!

2999
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:42,220
Oh, nice!

3000
02:02:42,380 --> 02:02:43,040
Lots of money!

3001
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:47,680
Yay!

3002
02:02:49,340 --> 02:02:50,560
Is there anything here?

3003
02:02:50,660 --> 02:02:51,300
Other than money?

3004
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:52,940
That's right, I'm greedy!

3005
02:02:54,720 --> 02:02:55,400
He's...

3006
02:02:55,400 --> 02:02:57,320
He said he's sorry!

3007
02:02:58,920 --> 02:03:02,780
Sorry I spilled the oil in the ocean!

3008
02:03:03,340 --> 02:03:03,860
I'm...

3009
02:03:05,420 --> 02:03:06,460
I'm sorry!

3010
02:03:07,360 --> 02:03:07,880
Okay.

3011
02:03:11,800 --> 02:03:13,220
I got that house.

3012
02:03:13,400 --> 02:03:14,700
Okay, let's get his house, too.

3013
02:03:17,820 --> 02:03:18,320
Okay.

3014
02:03:19,320 --> 02:03:20,560
Save this house.

3015
02:03:23,920 --> 02:03:24,900
We did it!

3016
02:03:25,060 --> 02:03:26,160
Thank you so much!

3017
02:03:26,420 --> 02:03:28,100
I'll talk to the other gremlins.

3018
02:03:28,420 --> 02:03:30,940
Everyone will know about what you've done for me here.

3019
02:03:34,200 --> 02:03:35,540
Alright, nice.

3020
02:03:35,980 --> 02:03:36,660
Fix that.

3021
02:03:37,980 --> 02:03:40,540
Thank you for saving Gus's house, Mickey!

3022
02:03:41,240 --> 02:03:41,500
Huh?

3023
02:03:41,800 --> 02:03:42,640
Oh boy!

3024
02:03:43,120 --> 02:03:44,220
No problem!

3025
02:03:45,480 --> 02:03:47,140
Okay, we'll go this way.

3026
02:03:48,540 --> 02:03:49,680
Where's the...

3027
02:03:49,680 --> 02:03:50,380
The ship.

3028
02:03:51,560 --> 02:03:53,480
So I can clear Pete's name.

3029
02:03:53,920 --> 02:03:56,060
For the sake of both of us.

3030
02:03:57,020 --> 02:03:58,940
I'm not doing it for him.

3031
02:03:58,940 --> 02:04:01,900
Wait, no, I'm doing it for him because I care about him.

3032
02:04:03,660 --> 02:04:04,140
Guys.

3033
02:04:04,900 --> 02:04:07,020
It's not for any selfish reasons.

3034
02:04:08,340 --> 02:04:11,280
Oh my god, this guy has security cameras in his own home.

3035
02:04:11,580 --> 02:04:12,860
This guy's paranoid as fuck.

3036
02:04:16,900 --> 02:04:19,630
The swamp Pete situation is crazy.

3037
02:04:20,740 --> 02:04:21,020
Hahaha!

3038
02:04:23,680 --> 02:04:24,540
I'm not like...

3039
02:04:24,540 --> 02:04:25,570
I don't need to...

3040
02:04:27,400 --> 02:04:27,980
Uh...

3041
02:04:27,980 --> 02:04:29,710
Yeah, I don't need to...

3042
02:04:30,240 --> 02:04:30,940
Oh my gosh.

3043
02:04:31,220 --> 02:04:32,760
Wait, how do I actually get up there?

3044
02:04:36,360 --> 02:04:37,640
Oh shit, whoops.

3045
02:04:39,940 --> 02:04:40,700
I can't...

3046
02:04:40,700 --> 02:04:40,840
I can't...

3047
02:04:40,840 --> 02:04:41,700
Yeah, I can tank that.

3048
02:04:42,940 --> 02:04:43,840
Yeah, how the fuck?

3049
02:04:45,160 --> 02:04:47,040
How do I get up there actually?

3050
02:04:51,040 --> 02:04:53,340
Wait, let me rob this guy's house real quick.

3051
02:04:54,700 --> 02:04:55,160
Yay!

3052
02:05:00,230 --> 02:05:01,470
Sorry, I meant borrow.

3053
02:05:01,470 --> 02:05:03,910
I'm just borrowing some money.

3054
02:05:04,110 --> 02:05:05,110
Tickets, please.

3055
02:05:06,430 --> 02:05:07,570
Oh yeah, no.

3056
02:05:07,690 --> 02:05:09,350
The platforming is really smooth here.

3057
02:05:10,070 --> 02:05:10,970
Ah!

3058
02:05:14,260 --> 02:05:14,880
Sorry.

3059
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:15,320
Hahaha.

3060
02:05:22,480 --> 02:05:23,340
It's not a thing.

3061
02:05:27,160 --> 02:05:28,940
I didn't know, burn me!

3062
02:05:30,460 --> 02:05:30,980
Okay.

3063
02:05:31,580 --> 02:05:33,280
How do I get to...

3064
02:05:33,280 --> 02:05:34,060
Are you...

3065
02:05:34,060 --> 02:05:34,480
Oh my god.

3066
02:05:34,580 --> 02:05:35,340
Oh my god, that scared me.

3067
02:05:36,040 --> 02:05:38,120
Okay, how do I get up there?

3068
02:05:40,660 --> 02:05:41,180
Like...

3069
02:05:41,180 --> 02:05:42,880
Like, I can't...

3070
02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:43,600
There's no way.

3071
02:05:43,700 --> 02:05:44,460
Oh, I do make it.

3072
02:05:44,560 --> 02:05:47,600
Okay, I couldn't tell that if I would make it or not.

3073
02:05:48,260 --> 02:05:49,500
It's so hard to tell.

3074
02:05:53,040 --> 02:05:54,880
Okay, we gotta find the logs.

3075
02:05:56,060 --> 02:05:56,780
That's me in here.

3076
02:06:00,420 --> 02:06:01,700
Okay, there's the logs.

3077
02:06:03,220 --> 02:06:04,680
Green is a dangerous color.

3078
02:06:08,590 --> 02:06:09,030
Alright.

3079
02:06:10,430 --> 02:06:12,110
Alright, I got his log book.

3080
02:06:12,710 --> 02:06:13,750
Don't worry, Pete.

3081
02:06:14,410 --> 02:06:16,050
I'm gonna clear your innocence.

3082
02:06:19,330 --> 02:06:21,290
Just like any good friend would do.

3083
02:06:21,490 --> 02:06:23,250
I told you guys he was a good person.

3084
02:06:26,390 --> 02:06:27,890
He's just misunderstood.

3085
02:06:29,990 --> 02:06:32,810
Oh, it says here in the log that the crash was an accident.

3086
02:06:33,350 --> 02:06:34,030
And small...

3087
02:06:36,930 --> 02:06:39,550
Dear Diary, I didn't do it.

3088
02:06:39,710 --> 02:06:42,470
And then you submit that as evidence in the court of law.

3089
02:06:44,510 --> 02:06:45,750
I didn't do it.

3090
02:06:45,850 --> 02:06:47,790
And I feel bad about it.

3091
02:06:48,710 --> 02:06:50,850
I didn't know he had feelings.

3092
02:06:51,210 --> 02:06:54,430
I'll let the other grievous know it was all misunderstanding.

3093
02:06:55,350 --> 02:06:56,110
Oh, yay!

3094
02:06:57,530 --> 02:06:59,090
I'm seeing you in a hole.

3095
02:06:59,330 --> 02:07:00,530
Not guilty.

3096
02:07:01,390 --> 02:07:02,510
And I...

3097
02:07:02,510 --> 02:07:03,890
And I...

3098
02:07:03,890 --> 02:07:06,810
In the court of law, we...

3099
02:07:09,290 --> 02:07:13,230
In the court of law, we judge thee not guilty.

3100
02:07:15,910 --> 02:07:18,070
I didn't believe it when he said it.

3101
02:07:18,170 --> 02:07:21,150
But now that he wrote it down, it's undeniable.

3102
02:07:22,370 --> 02:07:23,830
Sorry, I can't open the skate.

3103
02:07:24,030 --> 02:07:25,090
I don't mean I won't.

3104
02:07:25,090 --> 02:07:26,070
I mean I can't.

3105
02:07:26,230 --> 02:07:29,050
The pump that controls the door is at the top of the village tower.

3106
02:07:29,390 --> 02:07:31,690
Use that pump to get the gates functioning.

3107
02:07:32,250 --> 02:07:33,830
Let's get this house back first.

3108
02:07:36,190 --> 02:07:38,510
Your honor, my client pleads.

3109
02:07:38,810 --> 02:07:39,290
Oopsie.

3110
02:07:46,970 --> 02:07:48,430
Wait, there's something over here.

3111
02:07:49,010 --> 02:07:49,630
Is there?

3112
02:07:50,050 --> 02:07:51,270
Oh, no, there isn't.

3113
02:07:54,150 --> 02:07:56,330
In the court of law, I peed.

3114
02:07:58,670 --> 02:08:01,950
I felt really bad, though, when it happened.

3115
02:08:04,030 --> 02:08:06,550
Thank you again for freeing me from Dark Beauty Castle.

3116
02:08:06,910 --> 02:08:09,090
I was looking for a way to show my appreciation.

3117
02:08:09,570 --> 02:08:10,670
I came up with this.

3118
02:08:10,930 --> 02:08:12,010
Wait, what did he came up with?

3119
02:08:14,770 --> 02:08:16,790
What did he came up with?

3120
02:08:17,470 --> 02:08:18,590
What was it?

3121
02:08:21,830 --> 02:08:23,730
I don't even know what it was.

3122
02:08:27,430 --> 02:08:28,930
My client pleads.

3123
02:08:29,110 --> 02:08:30,010
Whoopsie dokes.

3124
02:08:30,390 --> 02:08:31,290
Whoopsie daisy.

3125
02:08:32,810 --> 02:08:34,530
What the fuck did he do?

3126
02:08:34,870 --> 02:08:35,950
Oh, he gave me money?

3127
02:08:36,130 --> 02:08:36,610
Oh, nice.

3128
02:08:37,170 --> 02:08:38,550
Okay, I take those.

3129
02:08:40,450 --> 02:08:41,370
That's fucking right.

3130
02:08:41,550 --> 02:08:42,230
Give me the money.

3131
02:08:44,530 --> 02:08:46,150
Let's give him this house back, too.

3132
02:08:48,230 --> 02:08:49,510
So, you sure the ship's locked to Bennett?

3133
02:08:49,730 --> 02:08:51,630
Well, now I can't treat...

3134
02:08:51,630 --> 02:08:52,230
I didn't...

3135
02:08:52,230 --> 02:08:52,430
What?

3136
02:08:53,010 --> 02:08:54,670
You would have given me the pin?

3137
02:08:57,450 --> 02:08:59,150
Why did I know I could...

3138
02:08:59,150 --> 02:09:00,130
Oh, my God.

3139
02:09:01,310 --> 02:09:03,970
I didn't know there was another guy that wanted it.

3140
02:09:05,230 --> 02:09:06,250
That's fucked up.

3141
02:09:06,490 --> 02:09:07,290
I can't believe it.

3142
02:09:07,370 --> 02:09:08,030
I lost...

3143
02:09:08,030 --> 02:09:09,310
I lost an achievement.

3144
02:09:12,330 --> 02:09:13,710
I can't believe it.

3145
02:09:13,890 --> 02:09:15,250
Why would you be here?

3146
02:09:15,390 --> 02:09:16,970
I would not talk to you first.

3147
02:09:17,810 --> 02:09:19,610
Why were you all the way up here?

3148
02:09:21,950 --> 02:09:23,550
Thank you for fixing this pipe.

3149
02:09:23,550 --> 02:09:25,370
Can you fix the village tower as well?

3150
02:09:25,850 --> 02:09:27,950
Okay, I'll paint this guy's home first.

3151
02:09:29,070 --> 02:09:30,550
Oh, why not?

3152
02:09:34,750 --> 02:09:37,270
What about Pete's innocence?

3153
02:09:37,750 --> 02:09:39,350
What about my pin?

3154
02:09:41,970 --> 02:09:43,230
My achievements!

3155
02:09:47,800 --> 02:09:48,680
Okay, nice.

3156
02:09:48,860 --> 02:09:49,200
Oh, money.

3157
02:09:50,280 --> 02:09:52,680
The cost of betrayal of pin.

3158
02:09:52,920 --> 02:09:55,060
That's all it takes, huh, Doki?

3159
02:09:55,060 --> 02:09:55,940
Yes.

3160
02:09:58,920 --> 02:10:01,340
My pin collection ruined!

3161
02:10:03,240 --> 02:10:04,400
How else?

3162
02:10:04,680 --> 02:10:06,660
What would the other...

3163
02:10:06,660 --> 02:10:09,540
Actually, is there a name for those pin collectors anyway?

3164
02:10:11,540 --> 02:10:13,620
What would they say about me?

3165
02:10:13,840 --> 02:10:16,980
If I don't come back with the exclusive pin?

3166
02:10:17,840 --> 02:10:20,040
How will I show my face to them?

3167
02:10:24,400 --> 02:10:24,880
What?

3168
02:10:25,140 --> 02:10:25,320
What?

3169
02:10:25,520 --> 02:10:26,160
Oh, shit!

3170
02:10:26,500 --> 02:10:26,920
Run!

3171
02:10:30,970 --> 02:10:32,110
Guys, that was a...

3172
02:10:32,110 --> 02:10:33,590
It's called a friendship slap, okay?

3173
02:10:34,210 --> 02:10:36,230
It was a friendship slap, guys.

3174
02:10:39,010 --> 02:10:40,670
Thank you for getting out of here, Mickey.

3175
02:10:40,910 --> 02:10:42,150
It was fogging up.

3176
02:10:43,150 --> 02:10:44,650
You're fake collecting.

3177
02:10:44,650 --> 02:10:47,410
I'll enable that projector screen behind you.

3178
02:10:47,570 --> 02:10:49,950
It's a secret shortcut to the European boat ride.

3179
02:10:50,290 --> 02:10:51,410
Don't tell anyone.

3180
02:10:52,610 --> 02:10:53,750
Did I not fix it?

3181
02:10:57,160 --> 02:10:58,680
Wait, but I gotta fix the...

3182
02:10:58,680 --> 02:10:59,360
The tower.

3183
02:11:00,060 --> 02:11:01,260
Did I fix it?

3184
02:11:01,860 --> 02:11:02,580
I can't tell.

3185
02:11:04,120 --> 02:11:04,740
All right.

3186
02:11:08,280 --> 02:11:08,760
Uh...

3187
02:11:08,760 --> 02:11:09,060
No.

3188
02:11:10,220 --> 02:11:11,000
Wait, what?

3189
02:11:13,020 --> 02:11:14,140
I thought I fixed it.

3190
02:11:14,920 --> 02:11:15,960
I have friends now.

3191
02:11:17,400 --> 02:11:18,500
Oh, there's something here.

3192
02:11:22,460 --> 02:11:22,940
Oh...

3193
02:11:22,940 --> 02:11:25,420
Okay, if I didn't fix it, then what do I have to do?

3194
02:11:26,580 --> 02:11:27,400
Maybe up here?

3195
02:11:27,540 --> 02:11:27,760
Oh!

3196
02:11:28,260 --> 02:11:30,060
That's the tower I have to fix.

3197
02:11:31,920 --> 02:11:32,840
Oh, shit!

3198
02:11:33,780 --> 02:11:35,080
It's okay, I can tank it.

3199
02:11:36,040 --> 02:11:36,600
Okay.

3200
02:11:38,060 --> 02:11:41,080
And I'll tank it, and then I'll go on my...

3201
02:11:41,080 --> 02:11:43,260
I can show you the world.

3202
02:11:48,380 --> 02:11:54,140
It still surprised me that my friend liked Kingdom Hearts, because they had no nostalgia feeling going into it.

3203
02:11:54,820 --> 02:11:57,700
Because Kingdom Hearts 1 was definitely fueled by nostalgia bait.

3204
02:11:57,700 --> 02:12:00,300
I already traveled to the top of the village tower?

3205
02:12:00,620 --> 02:12:01,100
Yeah.

3206
02:12:09,490 --> 02:12:10,210
All right.

3207
02:12:14,290 --> 02:12:15,370
What did I do?

3208
02:12:16,090 --> 02:12:17,090
Oh, nice.

3209
02:12:28,090 --> 02:12:29,230
I'm gonna go up.

3210
02:12:29,490 --> 02:12:30,570
Up I go!

3211
02:12:30,870 --> 02:12:31,610
Take me up.

3212
02:12:32,390 --> 02:12:32,930
Oh!

3213
02:12:33,310 --> 02:12:35,150
Oh, that's such a cute mechanic!

3214
02:12:35,470 --> 02:12:36,370
Okay, I like that.

3215
02:12:36,770 --> 02:12:38,650
When you run, it goes up.

3216
02:12:38,970 --> 02:12:40,130
Oh, I like that.

3217
02:12:40,370 --> 02:12:41,130
That's cute.

3218
02:12:43,570 --> 02:12:44,330
Get up!

3219
02:12:44,570 --> 02:12:45,110
Wake up!

3220
02:12:46,750 --> 02:12:47,330
Okay.

3221
02:12:47,770 --> 02:12:49,930
Just wanna grab the tickets here first.

3222
02:12:51,730 --> 02:12:52,710
That's so smart.

3223
02:12:53,590 --> 02:12:55,210
I miss when they...

3224
02:12:55,210 --> 02:12:56,710
Oh, I miss when Disney...

3225
02:12:56,710 --> 02:12:59,250
They used to do the, like, actual creative Disney games.

3226
02:13:00,170 --> 02:13:00,750
Um...

3227
02:13:00,750 --> 02:13:01,670
The Disney Studios.

3228
02:13:02,450 --> 02:13:04,870
But, like, they stopped focusing on games.

3229
02:13:06,510 --> 02:13:07,450
For a while.

3230
02:13:08,330 --> 02:13:09,330
I don't remember who would...

3231
02:13:09,330 --> 02:13:09,870
Was it what?

3232
02:13:10,050 --> 02:13:11,210
It was Bob Agner?

3233
02:13:11,810 --> 02:13:12,450
That wasn't him?

3234
02:13:12,850 --> 02:13:13,570
We had to...

3235
02:13:13,570 --> 02:13:14,150
They had to...

3236
02:13:14,150 --> 02:13:14,650
Like, say, Wii.

3237
02:13:16,150 --> 02:13:19,230
Disney, at one point, did, like, a full investment.

3238
02:13:20,710 --> 02:13:21,430
And, um...

3239
02:13:21,430 --> 02:13:22,170
In Disney games.

3240
02:13:22,290 --> 02:13:23,510
Like, actual Disney games.

3241
02:13:23,950 --> 02:13:24,550
Because they're, like...

3242
02:13:24,550 --> 02:13:26,390
Oh, that's, like, the next, like...

3243
02:13:27,630 --> 02:13:27,990
Um...

3244
02:13:27,990 --> 02:13:30,290
The next venture into, like...

3245
02:13:30,290 --> 02:13:31,110
What's it called?

3246
02:13:32,430 --> 02:13:34,930
The next venture into, like, creative...

3247
02:13:35,830 --> 02:13:36,790
Properties and stuff.

3248
02:13:40,760 --> 02:13:44,300
And they decided to make, like, video games and stuff for all their Disney properties.

3249
02:13:44,600 --> 02:13:45,340
And then, like...

3250
02:13:45,340 --> 02:13:47,400
And then that ended and everybody...

3251
02:13:47,400 --> 02:13:48,460
And now they're, like...

3252
02:13:48,460 --> 02:13:48,700
Move...

3253
02:13:48,700 --> 02:13:50,120
Live-action movie time!

3254
02:13:51,900 --> 02:13:53,960
Yeah, next venture into, like...

3255
02:13:53,960 --> 02:13:55,320
The next big thing for Disney.

3256
02:13:56,120 --> 02:13:56,800
They had...

3257
02:13:56,800 --> 02:13:58,900
Had so many good games, too.

3258
02:14:00,560 --> 02:14:01,180
Wow!

3259
02:14:01,640 --> 02:14:02,100
Whoops.

3260
02:14:08,170 --> 02:14:08,790
Okay.

3261
02:14:09,850 --> 02:14:10,170
No!

3262
02:14:12,550 --> 02:14:13,590
Put me up!

3263
02:14:13,930 --> 02:14:14,610
Eat me up!

3264
02:14:16,950 --> 02:14:18,450
Oh, is it Bob Eisner?

3265
02:14:18,450 --> 02:14:19,150
I don't...

3266
02:14:19,150 --> 02:14:20,330
Yeah, I don't remember the name.

3267
02:14:20,730 --> 02:14:22,030
Of the Disney studios.

3268
02:14:22,450 --> 02:14:23,110
There's so many.

3269
02:14:23,890 --> 02:14:24,710
Block cleaners.

3270
02:14:24,870 --> 02:14:25,250
Part one.

3271
02:14:26,690 --> 02:14:27,530
Yeah, I'm ready.

3272
02:14:30,470 --> 02:14:30,950
Yeah.

3273
02:14:31,190 --> 02:14:32,010
That's why, like...

3274
02:14:32,010 --> 02:14:33,910
They want to shut the Disney game studios down.

3275
02:14:34,110 --> 02:14:34,330
We...

3276
02:14:34,330 --> 02:14:35,410
They just, like...

3277
02:14:35,410 --> 02:14:37,750
Outsourged their game production to different studios.

3278
02:14:38,290 --> 02:14:41,690
I don't know any, like, recent good Disney game that came up.

3279
02:14:49,020 --> 02:14:49,500
Okay.

3280
02:14:49,620 --> 02:14:51,120
Can I have one oopsie, though?

3281
02:14:51,980 --> 02:14:53,000
Guys, they're, like...

3282
02:14:53,180 --> 02:14:53,960
Oh, my God!

3283
02:14:54,100 --> 02:14:55,420
Mickey fixed everything!

3284
02:14:58,480 --> 02:15:00,060
Lose a paint and thinner pump.

3285
02:15:00,260 --> 02:15:01,620
Standard equipment on most rides.

3286
02:15:01,820 --> 02:15:02,840
It can be filled with...

3287
02:15:03,440 --> 02:15:05,940
Why would you tell me about the thinner part?

3288
02:15:06,340 --> 02:15:07,660
For your fucking village.

3289
02:15:11,760 --> 02:15:12,240
Like...

3290
02:15:12,240 --> 02:15:13,160
Like, it's like...

3291
02:15:13,160 --> 02:15:14,100
This is my village!

3292
02:15:14,300 --> 02:15:16,120
Anyway, you could destroy it!

3293
02:15:24,860 --> 02:15:25,700
They did it!

3294
02:15:25,860 --> 02:15:27,140
The exit gate is open!

3295
02:15:30,320 --> 02:15:31,780
Alright, we open the gate.

3296
02:15:33,360 --> 02:15:35,860
I mean, you could, but you won't, right, Mickey?

3297
02:15:35,860 --> 02:15:37,760
Yeah, you won't do that!

3298
02:15:41,340 --> 02:15:41,940
Yeah.

3299
02:15:43,580 --> 02:15:44,800
Does that mean I could?

3300
02:15:46,980 --> 02:15:49,200
Okay, so this is...

3301
02:15:50,220 --> 02:15:52,340
Steamboat Willie's scene too.

3302
02:15:52,460 --> 02:15:53,400
But what about over there?

3303
02:15:54,360 --> 02:15:55,240
That's the thing.

3304
02:15:56,640 --> 02:15:57,240
Like...

3305
02:15:57,240 --> 02:15:59,700
Can I go to the tower now for that?

3306
02:16:08,250 --> 02:16:11,110
I want to check this real quick.

3307
02:16:11,370 --> 02:16:12,310
The clock, you know.

3308
02:16:14,770 --> 02:16:16,070
What is that area?

3309
02:16:16,650 --> 02:16:18,950
Like, why would I have to do this area?

3310
02:16:19,190 --> 02:16:20,150
I'm so confused.

3311
02:16:22,630 --> 02:16:23,150
Okay.

3312
02:16:23,470 --> 02:16:24,210
Let's do this one.

3313
02:16:27,470 --> 02:16:27,990
Alright.

3314
02:16:28,490 --> 02:16:28,830
Yeah.

3315
02:16:29,090 --> 02:16:29,490
Oh, wait.

3316
02:16:29,690 --> 02:16:29,810
What?

3317
02:16:30,190 --> 02:16:31,550
I have unfinished quests?

3318
02:16:33,570 --> 02:16:34,990
Where are my unfinished quests?

3319
02:16:39,940 --> 02:16:40,380
Yeah.

3320
02:16:40,700 --> 02:16:41,660
I already did everything.

3321
02:16:41,820 --> 02:16:41,980
Okay.

3322
02:16:44,220 --> 02:16:46,780
Maybe unfinished quests here, but we might not be able to return.

3323
02:16:47,120 --> 02:16:48,780
I already entered the European boat ride.

3324
02:16:49,740 --> 02:16:50,180
Yes.

3325
02:16:59,700 --> 02:17:00,140
Alright.

3326
02:17:00,320 --> 02:17:00,600
Nice.

3327
02:17:01,940 --> 02:17:02,380
Yeah!

3328
02:17:03,160 --> 02:17:04,080
Oh, this is scene two?

3329
02:17:04,240 --> 02:17:05,520
Oh, this is scene two!

3330
02:17:06,740 --> 02:17:07,180
Okay.

3331
02:17:17,040 --> 02:17:18,720
I love scene two, really, son.

3332
02:17:19,760 --> 02:17:20,220
Such a clap.

3333
02:17:20,340 --> 02:17:21,160
Oh my god, it's you!

3334
02:17:21,340 --> 02:17:21,880
Fuck you!

3335
02:17:22,200 --> 02:17:23,340
I hated this goat.

3336
02:17:26,200 --> 02:17:27,520
I hated this goat.

3337
02:17:27,700 --> 02:17:28,120
This...

3338
02:17:28,120 --> 02:17:29,540
Oh, what Disney game is it?

3339
02:17:29,840 --> 02:17:30,980
Was it on the...

3340
02:17:30,980 --> 02:17:33,200
Oh, I don't remember which one it was.

3341
02:17:33,620 --> 02:17:34,100
But...

3342
02:17:34,100 --> 02:17:35,700
There was a...

3343
02:17:35,700 --> 02:17:36,260
Um...

3344
02:17:36,260 --> 02:17:38,680
An old Disney game with that goat in it.

3345
02:17:38,860 --> 02:17:40,300
And then I always died to that goat.

3346
02:17:40,540 --> 02:17:42,240
But I could never remember exactly...

3347
02:17:42,240 --> 02:17:43,100
Was it the mirror one?

3348
02:17:43,160 --> 02:17:44,480
Was it the one with the...

3349
02:17:44,480 --> 02:17:45,040
Mirror?

3350
02:17:45,360 --> 02:17:46,420
I don't remember.

3351
02:17:46,660 --> 02:17:47,580
But there's that goat.

3352
02:17:47,780 --> 02:17:49,520
I'll always remember that goat.

3353
02:17:52,420 --> 02:17:53,980
I got beef with that goat.

3354
02:17:54,660 --> 02:17:55,980
Is it Castle of Illusions?

3355
02:17:55,980 --> 02:17:57,580
It's the one with their world.

3356
02:17:57,800 --> 02:17:58,760
It's like pixel art.

3357
02:18:01,500 --> 02:18:02,320
I don't remember.

3358
02:18:02,480 --> 02:18:03,340
But fuck this goat.

3359
02:18:03,560 --> 02:18:04,040
Fuck you!

3360
02:18:04,720 --> 02:18:06,020
I always died to that goat.

3361
02:18:06,140 --> 02:18:08,580
Little me would always die to that goddamn goat.

3362
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:10,120
I'll never forget.

3363
02:18:14,350 --> 02:18:15,410
I don't know if it's...

3364
02:18:15,410 --> 02:18:16,490
I don't know if it's Castle...

3365
02:18:16,490 --> 02:18:17,690
Oh, it could be Castle of Illusion.

3366
02:18:17,790 --> 02:18:18,690
It was a pixel game.

3367
02:18:21,690 --> 02:18:23,190
Doki never forgets.

3368
02:18:24,050 --> 02:18:24,870
Yeah, I'm ready.

3369
02:18:38,280 --> 02:18:38,900
Oh my god.

3370
02:18:39,020 --> 02:18:40,660
There's little boys down there.

3371
02:18:41,420 --> 02:18:42,740
This is the Europe area.

3372
02:18:43,340 --> 02:18:44,600
Oh, it's like a whole new world.

3373
02:18:44,760 --> 02:18:45,540
No, not a whole new world.

3374
02:18:45,620 --> 02:18:46,380
It's like...

3375
02:18:46,380 --> 02:18:47,140
What is it called?

3376
02:18:47,460 --> 02:18:48,020
Small world!

3377
02:18:48,100 --> 02:18:48,880
It's a small world!

3378
02:18:49,680 --> 02:18:50,980
Look at that leaning tower.

3379
02:18:51,180 --> 02:18:52,020
I hope it doesn't fall.

3380
02:18:52,320 --> 02:18:54,640
Every year, the tower leans a little bit.

3381
02:18:56,580 --> 02:18:57,600
You guys know that?

3382
02:18:58,100 --> 02:18:59,640
Just a tiny little bit.

3383
02:19:00,100 --> 02:19:01,480
One day it's actually...

3384
02:19:01,480 --> 02:19:03,160
I feel like one day it's gonna fucking fall.

3385
02:19:03,600 --> 02:19:04,840
Hey god.

3386
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,740
It leans more and more every year.

3387
02:19:09,460 --> 02:19:11,440
Until it can't lean no more.

3388
02:19:17,040 --> 02:19:20,060
These pillars look like they could topple over with a sneeze.

3389
02:19:24,130 --> 02:19:24,810
Friends!

3390
02:19:25,290 --> 02:19:27,250
Do not resist friendship!

3391
02:19:28,990 --> 02:19:30,390
Do not resist!

3392
02:19:31,290 --> 02:19:32,910
We are friends!

3393
02:19:34,670 --> 02:19:35,630
Okay, nice.

3394
02:19:40,080 --> 02:19:40,600
Alright.

3395
02:19:42,940 --> 02:19:45,000
Wait, it feels like there's something behind this.

3396
02:19:45,140 --> 02:19:45,980
Yeah, I knew it.

3397
02:19:46,160 --> 02:19:47,040
I fucking knew it.

3398
02:19:47,300 --> 02:19:48,760
I saw that little peek.

3399
02:19:50,960 --> 02:19:52,920
Do not be afraid!

3400
02:19:53,380 --> 02:19:55,300
We shall become best friends!

3401
02:19:58,640 --> 02:19:59,820
Hey, what's over here?

3402
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:03,640
Money!

3403
02:20:07,500 --> 02:20:09,380
Alright, let's grab all that money.

3404
02:20:10,820 --> 02:20:13,100
We do maintenance to make sure it's stable.

3405
02:20:13,600 --> 02:20:14,280
It's still...

3406
02:20:14,280 --> 02:20:14,940
It's still like...

3407
02:20:15,420 --> 02:20:17,080
Oh, get inside the coliseum.

3408
02:20:17,820 --> 02:20:18,700
It still...

3409
02:20:18,700 --> 02:20:20,660
It still leans a little bit, though.

3410
02:20:20,900 --> 02:20:22,140
That's the scary part.

3411
02:20:23,360 --> 02:20:23,960
Friends.

3412
02:20:25,940 --> 02:20:26,580
Friends.

3413
02:20:28,060 --> 02:20:28,700
Friends.

3414
02:20:30,460 --> 02:20:30,860
Friends.

3415
02:20:35,120 --> 02:20:35,520
Hey!

3416
02:20:37,440 --> 02:20:38,140
Does it move?

3417
02:20:38,560 --> 02:20:38,900
Uh...

3418
02:20:38,900 --> 02:20:39,000
How's that?

3419
02:20:39,080 --> 02:20:39,900
I didn't give you the super chat.

3420
02:20:40,040 --> 02:20:40,280
Thank you.

3421
02:20:40,440 --> 02:20:40,980
Thank you.

3422
02:20:47,550 --> 02:20:48,250
Anything back?

3423
02:20:48,390 --> 02:20:48,550
Yeah?

3424
02:20:48,990 --> 02:20:49,690
Oh, there is.

3425
02:20:51,510 --> 02:20:53,150
Oh, there's something behind there.

3426
02:20:55,670 --> 02:20:56,630
I knew it.

3427
02:20:58,050 --> 02:20:59,810
I knew there was something back here.

3428
02:21:00,710 --> 02:21:02,410
I like how it keeps giving me the green paint.

3429
02:21:03,110 --> 02:21:04,910
They're like, you know you want to do it, Doki.

3430
02:21:05,370 --> 02:21:05,890
Come on.

3431
02:21:06,270 --> 02:21:07,210
Just a little bit.

3432
02:21:08,950 --> 02:21:10,330
Stop tensing me!

3433
02:21:11,830 --> 02:21:13,130
It's like the apple.

3434
02:21:13,730 --> 02:21:15,710
It's like, come on, take a bite, Doki.

3435
02:21:16,050 --> 02:21:17,810
Take a bite from that apple.

3436
02:21:19,410 --> 02:21:21,950
Use the thinner you know you want to.

3437
02:21:23,350 --> 02:21:26,810
I guess someone in my chat was like, please don't do the bad ending.

3438
02:21:28,630 --> 02:21:30,870
I never got to see it as a kid.

3439
02:21:31,110 --> 02:21:33,590
That means you were also a bad kid!

3440
02:21:36,530 --> 02:21:38,930
You have to live with your consequences.

3441
02:21:41,050 --> 02:21:43,210
These support beams are tuned or not.

3442
02:21:51,680 --> 02:21:53,620
I know what you did, child.

3443
02:21:53,900 --> 02:21:56,440
No, you were a sinner.

3444
02:21:58,100 --> 02:21:59,480
Oh my god, are you...

3445
02:22:00,880 --> 02:22:04,000
Wait, actually, I never did anything on this side of the map.

3446
02:22:04,120 --> 02:22:05,220
I should, like, check that out.

3447
02:22:08,780 --> 02:22:10,300
Wait, how did I get to this?

3448
02:22:10,380 --> 02:22:11,040
Oh, it's this way.

3449
02:22:11,620 --> 02:22:11,780
Okay.

3450
02:22:16,040 --> 02:22:16,440
Okay.

3451
02:22:18,920 --> 02:22:21,540
Because I realized I actually didn't do a lot from the main area.

3452
02:22:22,320 --> 02:22:24,120
I just went on my side quest here.

3453
02:22:28,400 --> 02:22:28,820
Oh.

3454
02:22:30,520 --> 02:22:31,940
Oh my god, I bought...

3455
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,460
Guys, I swear to god, I didn't do anything bad.

3456
02:22:39,460 --> 02:22:40,500
I swear...

3457
02:22:40,500 --> 02:22:42,340
I don't get...

3458
02:22:44,100 --> 02:22:46,200
I didn't realize...

3459
02:22:46,200 --> 02:22:49,440
I didn't realize that I wasn't supposed to do that.

3460
02:22:50,180 --> 02:22:51,760
I was like, oh, that's...

3461
02:22:51,760 --> 02:22:52,660
That's funny.

3462
02:22:56,020 --> 02:22:56,740
Vandalism.

3463
02:22:57,860 --> 02:22:59,240
We saw what you did.

3464
02:22:59,840 --> 02:23:01,080
We know what you did.

3465
02:23:01,220 --> 02:23:03,140
Oh no, I got the evil spirit now.

3466
02:23:07,340 --> 02:23:08,020
It's okay.

3467
02:23:08,200 --> 02:23:09,160
I get, like...

3468
02:23:09,160 --> 02:23:09,640
It's okay.

3469
02:23:09,720 --> 02:23:10,740
We still get the good ending.

3470
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,080
I just did one accident, guys.

3471
02:23:13,380 --> 02:23:14,660
You heard what they said.

3472
02:23:15,060 --> 02:23:16,100
I can always...

3473
02:23:16,100 --> 02:23:17,540
I just have one accident.

3474
02:23:20,440 --> 02:23:21,360
Look at that.

3475
02:23:21,420 --> 02:23:22,740
I'm fixing everything, guys.

3476
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:24,100
I'm fixing everything.

3477
02:23:24,400 --> 02:23:25,380
Look at me go.

3478
02:23:26,800 --> 02:23:28,140
Look at me go.

3479
02:23:28,140 --> 02:23:30,120
I'm fixing stuff, guys.

3480
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:32,880
I'm a good person.

3481
02:23:34,080 --> 02:23:35,840
I'm fixing stuff.

3482
02:23:36,220 --> 02:23:37,300
Look at me go.

3483
02:23:37,740 --> 02:23:38,060
Whoa.

3484
02:23:38,920 --> 02:23:39,840
Look at everything.

3485
02:23:39,840 --> 02:23:40,920
I'm fixing.

3486
02:23:46,170 --> 02:23:46,890
Yeah.

3487
02:23:48,170 --> 02:23:48,730
All right.

3488
02:23:48,730 --> 02:23:50,390
There's, like, something up here, though.

3489
02:23:52,750 --> 02:23:54,710
I'm just checking, I'm just checking, I'm just checking.

3490
02:23:56,850 --> 02:23:59,970
Yeah, see, there's, like, how do I... there's, like, something up there.

3491
02:24:00,850 --> 02:24:01,790
How do I get up there?

3492
02:24:05,830 --> 02:24:06,710
What's this?

3493
02:24:13,460 --> 02:24:15,780
Okay, I completed the Leaning Tower.

3494
02:24:16,220 --> 02:24:17,680
But what did I do?

3495
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,860
But what did I do, though?

3496
02:24:31,120 --> 02:24:31,360
Alright.

3497
02:24:35,800 --> 02:24:36,640
Uhhh...

3498
02:24:36,640 --> 02:24:40,060
It's a small world after all.

3499
02:24:40,240 --> 02:24:43,120
It's a small world after all.

3500
02:24:43,340 --> 02:24:45,940
It's a small world after all.

3501
02:24:46,100 --> 02:24:48,240
Ba-da-bum-bum-bum.

3502
02:24:50,580 --> 02:24:50,740
Okay.

3503
02:24:51,040 --> 02:24:52,240
I'll go back up here.

3504
02:24:57,120 --> 02:24:57,960
Oh my god.

3505
02:24:58,380 --> 02:24:59,960
I fucked up the parkour.

3506
02:25:00,160 --> 02:25:00,460
Oh!

3507
02:25:00,880 --> 02:25:01,620
I did.

3508
02:25:07,700 --> 02:25:08,600
Let me up!

3509
02:25:09,280 --> 02:25:09,760
Yay!

3510
02:25:10,780 --> 02:25:11,260
Okay.

3511
02:25:12,180 --> 02:25:13,320
Okay, as long as I...

3512
02:25:14,960 --> 02:25:16,440
Oh my god, where's the support?

3513
02:25:16,660 --> 02:25:17,020
Oh!

3514
02:25:18,040 --> 02:25:21,240
Oh my god, who would have thought the Eiffel Tower has a hole in the middle?

3515
02:25:21,240 --> 02:25:21,900
Oh!

3516
02:25:22,120 --> 02:25:22,740
Oh!

3517
02:25:27,060 --> 02:25:28,460
Okay, we'll do that.

3518
02:25:28,780 --> 02:25:29,600
No, I was...

3519
02:25:29,600 --> 02:25:30,840
I didn't look down.

3520
02:25:32,580 --> 02:25:33,220
Okay.

3521
02:25:33,680 --> 02:25:35,100
Let's try to figure something out.

3522
02:25:38,320 --> 02:25:39,960
Like, how do I...

3523
02:25:39,960 --> 02:25:41,780
How am I supposed to get up?

3524
02:25:45,540 --> 02:25:46,100
Okay.

3525
02:25:47,160 --> 02:25:47,720
Oh!

3526
02:25:48,140 --> 02:25:49,420
Okay, now that's how it...

3527
02:25:49,420 --> 02:25:49,700
Oh!

3528
02:25:50,180 --> 02:25:50,760
Okay, nice.

3529
02:25:51,600 --> 02:25:53,080
I was like, so confused.

3530
02:25:53,100 --> 02:25:55,040
I was like, how am I supposed to...

3531
02:25:55,620 --> 02:25:57,140
fix the Eiffel Tower?

3532
02:26:00,120 --> 02:26:02,000
Oh, I don't fix it.

3533
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:04,300
It's already fixed.

3534
02:26:05,080 --> 02:26:05,580
Right?

3535
02:26:11,290 --> 02:26:11,930
Like...

3536
02:26:11,930 --> 02:26:12,570
Right?

3537
02:26:14,390 --> 02:26:16,230
Is Eiffel Tower fixed already?

3538
02:26:16,650 --> 02:26:17,430
I can't tell.

3539
02:26:20,150 --> 02:26:22,030
I assume it's fixed, right?

3540
02:26:22,290 --> 02:26:24,150
Cause there's like, nothing I'm supposed to get?

3541
02:26:25,750 --> 02:26:26,470
Yeah.

3542
02:26:28,250 --> 02:26:31,330
There's no like, thing I'm supposed to turn here.

3543
02:26:32,070 --> 02:26:33,690
You mean the Eiffel Tower?

3544
02:26:33,870 --> 02:26:34,390
Ha ha ha!

3545
02:26:34,970 --> 02:26:35,790
Did you get that?

3546
02:26:37,650 --> 02:26:38,730
Topple the...

3547
02:26:38,730 --> 02:26:42,410
To find an alternative path to the Colosseum.

3548
02:26:43,410 --> 02:26:45,670
Topple the Parisian Tower?

3549
02:26:46,290 --> 02:26:48,330
That seems like me breaking something.

3550
02:26:55,060 --> 02:26:55,540
Okay.

3551
02:26:56,980 --> 02:26:57,900
We don't need that.

3552
02:26:57,940 --> 02:26:58,960
It's one ticket, guys.

3553
02:26:59,080 --> 02:26:59,740
We don't need it.

3554
02:26:59,960 --> 02:27:01,300
It's literally one ticket.

3555
02:27:01,480 --> 02:27:01,820
Oh, there...

3556
02:27:01,820 --> 02:27:01,960
Oh!

3557
02:27:02,020 --> 02:27:02,620
It's over here.

3558
02:27:02,740 --> 02:27:02,960
Okay.

3559
02:27:04,040 --> 02:27:06,100
Okay, so we have to get into the Colosseum.

3560
02:27:06,180 --> 02:27:08,400
Oh, that's a scary tiger mouth thing.

3561
02:27:10,020 --> 02:27:11,120
How do we...

3562
02:27:11,120 --> 02:27:13,120
I assume it's the boat ride then.

3563
02:27:16,600 --> 02:27:18,260
Doesn't seem like...

3564
02:27:18,260 --> 02:27:18,840
Oh!

3565
02:27:19,580 --> 02:27:22,920
If I want to be a bad person, I'll remove the support beams.

3566
02:27:23,140 --> 02:27:24,240
Yeah, I have to find another route.

3567
02:27:25,100 --> 02:27:26,800
But we're not bad people, guys.

3568
02:27:30,120 --> 02:27:31,400
Okay, I know where the...

3569
02:27:31,400 --> 02:27:33,540
I know where the alternative route is.

3570
02:27:38,290 --> 02:27:38,730
So...

3571
02:27:38,730 --> 02:27:39,190
Let's see.

3572
02:27:39,470 --> 02:27:41,270
How do we get to the actual...

3573
02:27:42,450 --> 02:27:45,690
I know where the bad route is.

3574
02:27:46,030 --> 02:27:47,650
So we need to find the...

3575
02:27:47,650 --> 02:27:48,530
Good route.

3576
02:27:50,330 --> 02:27:52,290
Wherever the good route is.

3577
02:27:52,430 --> 02:27:54,070
Where the fuck is the good route?

3578
02:27:55,670 --> 02:27:57,350
So I can be a good person.

3579
02:28:01,230 --> 02:28:01,870
I'm here.

3580
02:28:01,950 --> 02:28:02,910
I am a good person.

3581
02:28:10,550 --> 02:28:11,990
My god, where is it?

3582
02:28:14,810 --> 02:28:16,110
Where is it?

3583
02:28:18,350 --> 02:28:19,130
No.

3584
02:28:22,400 --> 02:28:23,180
No.

3585
02:28:26,690 --> 02:28:28,050
I'm gonna try out...

3586
02:28:28,050 --> 02:28:29,330
The Paris place again.

3587
02:28:30,090 --> 02:28:32,370
There has to be an alternative route here somewhere.

3588
02:28:37,690 --> 02:28:38,080
Okay.

3589
02:28:39,520 --> 02:28:40,840
Cause I'm like...

3590
02:28:42,520 --> 02:28:44,020
Yeah, press that button.

3591
02:28:45,680 --> 02:28:46,940
Maybe like...

3592
02:28:46,940 --> 02:28:47,140
Yeah?

3593
02:28:47,140 --> 02:28:47,220
Huh?

3594
02:28:49,900 --> 02:28:51,840
No, that just paints it back.

3595
02:28:52,860 --> 02:28:55,140
So we have to find a way to...

3596
02:28:56,080 --> 02:28:58,620
Maybe get over from this side?

3597
02:28:58,920 --> 02:28:59,500
Maybe?

3598
02:29:03,480 --> 02:29:04,840
I'm not stuck, guys.

3599
02:29:05,080 --> 02:29:06,460
I'm just trying to be a good...

3600
02:29:06,460 --> 02:29:07,820
I can do the evil thing!

3601
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:08,760
But I won't!

3602
02:29:10,900 --> 02:29:13,000
I won't do the evil thing!

3603
02:29:14,060 --> 02:29:16,200
I'm trying to do the good thing!

3604
02:29:18,200 --> 02:29:18,680
Okay.

3605
02:29:20,620 --> 02:29:22,500
The alternative path is like...

3606
02:29:22,500 --> 02:29:23,260
This way.

3607
02:29:23,580 --> 02:29:25,100
How the fuck do I get there?

3608
02:29:29,580 --> 02:29:31,140
No, it's not the boats.

3609
02:29:33,940 --> 02:29:36,160
I'm pretty sure it's not the boats.

3610
02:29:38,900 --> 02:29:39,940
Is it a plane?

3611
02:29:45,400 --> 02:29:46,620
Oh wait, there is!

3612
02:29:46,800 --> 02:29:47,760
Oh my god, you're right!

3613
02:29:50,620 --> 02:29:51,300
Watch this.

3614
02:29:52,100 --> 02:29:52,840
I mean...

3615
02:29:52,840 --> 02:29:53,140
Okay.

3616
02:29:53,420 --> 02:29:53,980
I mean, that worked.

3617
02:29:58,090 --> 02:29:59,450
Oh my god, it's over here.

3618
02:29:59,610 --> 02:30:00,130
I found it.

3619
02:30:02,150 --> 02:30:02,930
There we go.

3620
02:30:04,610 --> 02:30:05,130
Easy.

3621
02:30:07,210 --> 02:30:08,450
Now we're friends.

3622
02:30:12,270 --> 02:30:12,790
Okay.

3623
02:30:13,210 --> 02:30:13,990
Figure it out.

3624
02:30:17,220 --> 02:30:18,400
Okay, I need to...

3625
02:30:19,820 --> 02:30:21,200
Open this chest real...

3626
02:30:21,200 --> 02:30:22,000
Oh, never mind.

3627
02:30:23,220 --> 02:30:24,000
I assume...

3628
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:25,780
That's where I have to go.

3629
02:30:26,420 --> 02:30:27,060
That's right.

3630
02:30:27,120 --> 02:30:29,280
I took the leap of faith because I believed.

3631
02:30:32,520 --> 02:30:33,560
I'm a believer.

3632
02:30:38,600 --> 02:30:39,640
Let's see...

3633
02:30:40,620 --> 02:30:41,460
Oh shit.

3634
02:30:47,570 --> 02:30:50,290
I knew I wouldn't make that jump if I fucked that up.

3635
02:30:52,510 --> 02:30:53,550
What's over here?

3636
02:30:54,170 --> 02:30:55,390
I saw like...

3637
02:30:56,470 --> 02:30:58,550
Yeah, I saw like the thing over here.

3638
02:30:59,610 --> 02:31:00,950
What show is this?

3639
02:31:02,330 --> 02:31:02,930
What?

3640
02:31:03,890 --> 02:31:06,450
Oh, maybe that was like for the alternative path.

3641
02:31:07,110 --> 02:31:08,950
From the clock tower.

3642
02:31:10,790 --> 02:31:12,750
Okay, I got the shortcut here.

3643
02:31:16,520 --> 02:31:18,860
And I saw her face but...

3644
02:31:18,860 --> 02:31:21,100
Now I'm a believer.

3645
02:31:22,680 --> 02:31:23,680
Alright, this way.

3646
02:31:35,460 --> 02:31:36,180
Oh!

3647
02:31:36,500 --> 02:31:36,800
Oh!

3648
02:31:37,640 --> 02:31:41,540
How does Toki play with one hand and make a Twitter post with the other?

3649
02:31:41,740 --> 02:31:42,280
Is this what...

3650
02:31:42,280 --> 02:31:43,400
Wait, did I make a Twitter post?

3651
02:31:46,060 --> 02:31:47,060
Did I...

3652
02:31:47,060 --> 02:31:48,720
Did I schedule something?

3653
02:31:53,820 --> 02:31:55,020
Wait, what?

3654
02:31:59,720 --> 02:32:00,160
Oh!

3655
02:32:00,480 --> 02:32:01,440
Oh, my...

3656
02:32:01,440 --> 02:32:01,920
Oh, me!

3657
02:32:02,420 --> 02:32:03,300
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3658
02:32:03,480 --> 02:32:04,500
No, I'm just a gamer.

3659
02:32:04,680 --> 02:32:05,740
I was like, oh my god.

3660
02:32:05,840 --> 02:32:07,200
Did I actually schedule something?

3661
02:32:08,080 --> 02:32:08,820
I had to appear.

3662
02:32:09,060 --> 02:32:10,980
I was like, oh my god.

3663
02:32:11,160 --> 02:32:13,540
Did I accidentally made a tweet?

3664
02:32:19,180 --> 02:32:20,140
I'm just gaming.

3665
02:32:20,520 --> 02:32:21,380
That's really it.

3666
02:32:23,320 --> 02:32:24,520
I'm just that good.

3667
02:32:27,080 --> 02:32:28,500
That was actually a fear.

3668
02:32:28,640 --> 02:32:29,720
I was like, fear.

3669
02:32:30,260 --> 02:32:32,740
Did I accidentally...

3670
02:32:34,620 --> 02:32:35,520
Okay, there we go.

3671
02:32:37,960 --> 02:32:38,720
Open up!

3672
02:32:42,440 --> 02:32:43,180
My quail!

3673
02:32:43,320 --> 02:32:44,180
Thank you for the super chat!

3674
02:32:44,300 --> 02:32:44,800
Thank you, thank you.

3675
02:32:44,820 --> 02:32:45,720
Oh, a silver pin.

3676
02:32:45,960 --> 02:32:46,400
Nice.

3677
02:32:48,580 --> 02:32:49,300
Oh, shit!

3678
02:32:49,460 --> 02:32:49,640
Okay.

3679
02:32:50,480 --> 02:32:51,880
Keep forgetting about gravity.

3680
02:32:58,110 --> 02:32:59,630
Okay, yeah, we're not getting that.

3681
02:33:04,960 --> 02:33:06,360
Alright, nice.

3682
02:33:07,560 --> 02:33:08,900
Make that jump.

3683
02:33:10,280 --> 02:33:11,940
Then we make this jump.

3684
02:33:13,140 --> 02:33:14,600
And that's how you do it.

3685
02:33:16,700 --> 02:33:19,380
Okay, but how do you get that, though?

3686
02:33:22,360 --> 02:33:23,360
Let me in.

3687
02:33:24,360 --> 02:33:25,480
Let me in!

3688
02:33:26,680 --> 02:33:28,340
Okay, we got the alternate path.

3689
02:33:29,380 --> 02:33:30,200
Look at that.

3690
02:33:30,400 --> 02:33:30,460
Look at that.

3691
02:33:30,460 --> 02:33:31,820
We didn't destroy any...

3692
02:33:32,320 --> 02:33:33,160
European structures.

3693
02:33:34,500 --> 02:33:35,500
Hey, Mickey.

3694
02:33:36,160 --> 02:33:36,940
Look at that girl.

3695
02:33:37,880 --> 02:33:38,560
You did it!

3696
02:33:38,820 --> 02:33:45,100
I might have misjudged you, but watch out, cuz my cousin over on Mean Street makes me seem like a cuddly little kitten.

3697
02:33:45,840 --> 02:33:48,020
Oh, and help yourself to some treasure!

3698
02:33:48,340 --> 02:33:50,320
As for me, time to go!

3699
02:33:55,670 --> 02:33:56,470
Let me go!

3700
02:33:56,750 --> 02:33:58,030
I didn't destroy any historical...

3701
02:33:58,930 --> 02:33:59,290
artifacts!

3702
02:34:00,330 --> 02:34:01,110
Oh, a room full!

3703
02:34:01,170 --> 02:34:02,190
Oh, that's how I get it!

3704
02:34:02,450 --> 02:34:02,810
Nice!

3705
02:34:04,250 --> 02:34:06,110
Wait, how do I get to that room, though?

3706
02:34:09,990 --> 02:34:10,670
Back here?

3707
02:34:10,850 --> 02:34:12,150
You, like, teleported me...

3708
02:34:12,150 --> 02:34:12,890
in the front!

3709
02:34:13,930 --> 02:34:14,550
Fucking monster!

3710
02:34:14,710 --> 02:34:15,970
I don't even know how I got here!

3711
02:34:21,730 --> 02:34:22,190
What?

3712
02:34:23,190 --> 02:34:23,650
What?

3713
02:34:23,870 --> 02:34:24,910
What the fuck is the treasure, Pete?

3714
02:34:27,330 --> 02:34:27,790
See?

3715
02:34:27,970 --> 02:34:29,770
Be a good person and you get rewarded.

3716
02:34:31,050 --> 02:34:32,570
Oh, is this the treasure room?

3717
02:34:32,950 --> 02:34:33,410
Oh!

3718
02:34:34,610 --> 02:34:35,850
No, that's the entrance.

3719
02:34:41,440 --> 02:34:42,360
Hey, there's no...

3720
02:34:42,360 --> 02:34:43,800
How do I get to my treasure room?

3721
02:34:49,380 --> 02:34:50,300
What the fuck?

3722
02:34:56,820 --> 02:34:57,520
Where's my...

3723
02:34:57,520 --> 02:34:58,820
Where's my fucking treasure, Pete?

3724
02:35:01,520 --> 02:35:03,140
Oh my god, I don't know how I got here.

3725
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:05,520
How did I get here?

3726
02:35:05,660 --> 02:35:05,800
Okay.

3727
02:35:06,520 --> 02:35:06,680
Alright.

3728
02:35:07,440 --> 02:35:08,300
It's that door.

3729
02:35:12,680 --> 02:35:14,820
You remember which one is the door that...

3730
02:35:14,820 --> 02:35:15,760
Pete came...

3731
02:35:15,760 --> 02:35:16,320
Okay, there you go.

3732
02:35:16,880 --> 02:35:17,460
This is the door.

3733
02:35:18,540 --> 02:35:18,820
Yeah!

3734
02:35:24,540 --> 02:35:25,760
I got a bronze pin!

3735
02:35:26,120 --> 02:35:26,760
Let's go!

3736
02:35:28,320 --> 02:35:29,800
I got the coliseum...

3737
02:35:30,740 --> 02:35:31,520
Oh my god.

3738
02:35:33,380 --> 02:35:34,720
These two girls murdered her.

3739
02:35:35,800 --> 02:35:36,800
Now murder you all.

3740
02:35:40,440 --> 02:35:42,240
Okay, let's grab some more tickets.

3741
02:35:44,660 --> 02:35:45,180
Uh...

3742
02:35:45,180 --> 02:35:45,560
This way.

3743
02:35:48,260 --> 02:35:49,200
Off we go!

3744
02:35:52,340 --> 02:35:55,140
I'm pretty sure like, run dash is the fastest combo.

3745
02:35:56,060 --> 02:35:57,220
Let's grab tickets.

3746
02:35:57,540 --> 02:35:58,260
Tickets, please!

3747
02:35:59,540 --> 02:36:00,020
Oh?

3748
02:36:00,220 --> 02:36:01,100
Hey, what's down here?

3749
02:36:02,460 --> 02:36:02,900
Oh!

3750
02:36:03,120 --> 02:36:03,320
Oh!

3751
02:36:03,340 --> 02:36:03,420
Secret!

3752
02:36:06,920 --> 02:36:07,800
Oh, nevermind.

3753
02:36:07,920 --> 02:36:08,560
It wasn't a...

3754
02:36:08,560 --> 02:36:09,020
Oh wait, no!

3755
02:36:09,100 --> 02:36:09,820
It was a secret!

3756
02:36:10,260 --> 02:36:10,840
Oh, money!

3757
02:36:11,920 --> 02:36:13,520
Okay, we don't need that money though.

3758
02:36:14,820 --> 02:36:16,640
And now we go back here.

3759
02:36:18,060 --> 02:36:21,300
Alright, before we go teleport into this movie...

3760
02:36:21,300 --> 02:36:22,820
I need to use the bathroom!

3761
02:36:23,060 --> 02:36:23,760
I'll be right back, guys.

3762
02:37:38,730 --> 02:37:39,590
I'm back!

3763
02:37:40,870 --> 02:37:41,450
Uh...

3764
02:37:42,170 --> 02:37:42,750
Solid!

3765
02:37:43,390 --> 02:37:43,970
Power!

3766
02:37:44,490 --> 02:37:44,970
Neppers!

3767
02:37:45,310 --> 02:37:45,490
Min!

3768
02:37:45,810 --> 02:37:46,210
Butter!

3769
02:37:46,410 --> 02:37:46,730
Alan!

3770
02:37:46,930 --> 02:37:47,330
Zekra!

3771
02:37:47,590 --> 02:37:47,810
Bite!

3772
02:37:48,030 --> 02:37:48,590
Coyote!

3773
02:37:48,590 --> 02:37:49,870
Thank you for the super chat!

3774
02:37:50,050 --> 02:37:50,310
Thank you!

3775
02:37:50,570 --> 02:37:51,090
Thank you!

3776
02:37:51,470 --> 02:37:52,750
Alright, let's get in.

3777
02:37:54,070 --> 02:37:55,070
Blue sky do!

3778
02:37:56,410 --> 02:37:57,970
We can do!

3779
02:38:01,510 --> 02:38:02,110
Yay!

3780
02:38:05,500 --> 02:38:05,880
Okay.

3781
02:38:07,100 --> 02:38:07,980
Go this way.

3782
02:38:12,900 --> 02:38:14,680
Alright, let's go this way.

3783
02:38:16,760 --> 02:38:17,200
Bye.

3784
02:38:21,100 --> 02:38:21,760
Wait, what?

3785
02:38:21,920 --> 02:38:22,840
There was film over there?

3786
02:38:23,980 --> 02:38:25,320
Oh wait, I'm heading there now.

3787
02:38:26,140 --> 02:38:27,240
I was like, oh no!

3788
02:38:27,800 --> 02:38:28,900
How did I miss that?

3789
02:38:29,060 --> 02:38:30,040
I was like, oh, I'm heading there.

3790
02:38:33,020 --> 02:38:33,900
Okay, nice.

3791
02:38:38,140 --> 02:38:39,900
No, that was my cha...

3792
02:38:39,900 --> 02:38:41,080
This is your childhood?

3793
02:38:41,820 --> 02:38:42,060
What?

3794
02:38:42,740 --> 02:38:43,880
You were like...

3795
02:38:43,880 --> 02:38:44,100
80?

3796
02:38:49,980 --> 02:38:52,240
Hey, this is the child, it is, like...

3797
02:38:56,360 --> 02:38:56,720
Okay.

3798
02:38:58,460 --> 02:39:01,360
Gotta go this way, I'm just saying, like, is this...

3799
02:39:01,360 --> 02:39:04,440
Isn't this short, like, 1930s or some shit?

3800
02:39:10,200 --> 02:39:12,180
Oh, wait, I have to grab this.

3801
02:39:12,260 --> 02:39:13,640
Oh, wait, what the fuck is over there?

3802
02:39:19,460 --> 02:39:20,040
Oh, no.

3803
02:39:22,140 --> 02:39:23,460
Oh, I knew there was a secret.

3804
02:39:25,980 --> 02:39:27,700
Alright, nice, we got extra content.

3805
02:39:29,720 --> 02:39:30,620
But what's over here?

3806
02:39:30,620 --> 02:39:31,160
Hi, Pete!

3807
02:39:34,020 --> 02:39:35,900
Yo, I actually just found out that...

3808
02:39:35,900 --> 02:39:36,340
Ow, shit!

3809
02:39:36,460 --> 02:39:37,900
Oh my god, I'm 1 HP, I wasn't paying attention.

3810
02:39:38,420 --> 02:39:40,580
I just found out that, uh...

3811
02:39:41,960 --> 02:39:43,720
He was actually, is actually a cat.

3812
02:39:44,580 --> 02:39:46,180
And that's why, you know, like...

3813
02:39:46,800 --> 02:39:48,380
Mickey Mouse and Pete the cat.

3814
02:39:48,900 --> 02:39:50,260
I didn't realize he was a cat.

3815
02:39:50,420 --> 02:39:50,960
Until now.

3816
02:39:53,780 --> 02:39:56,160
This is a game that made me realize he was a cat.

3817
02:39:59,680 --> 02:40:01,360
I don't know, I just see him as...

3818
02:40:01,360 --> 02:40:03,700
I never saw him as, like...

3819
02:40:03,700 --> 02:40:06,560
I don't know, I just never see him as, like, an actual animal.

3820
02:40:06,560 --> 02:40:07,240
An animal.

3821
02:40:08,820 --> 02:40:09,940
Wait, what does this do?

3822
02:40:10,320 --> 02:40:11,360
I knew it!

3823
02:40:11,860 --> 02:40:12,520
Oh, no!

3824
02:40:14,620 --> 02:40:15,720
I didn't know!

3825
02:40:15,960 --> 02:40:16,080
Yeah!

3826
02:40:16,340 --> 02:40:17,300
Cause they just call him Pete.

3827
02:40:17,540 --> 02:40:18,760
They never call him Pete the cat.

3828
02:40:19,600 --> 02:40:20,660
Just call him...

3829
02:40:20,660 --> 02:40:21,760
Little Pete.

3830
02:40:24,780 --> 02:40:26,760
Yeah, like, you can tell Goofy's a dog.

3831
02:40:27,060 --> 02:40:29,380
Because, like, you know, like, look at him.

3832
02:40:29,380 --> 02:40:30,060
But...

3833
02:40:31,980 --> 02:40:33,020
But, like...

3834
02:40:33,020 --> 02:40:36,380
Pete, as a cat, was not very, like...

3835
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:37,840
What's over there?

3836
02:40:38,540 --> 02:40:39,600
Wasn't very, like...

3837
02:40:40,300 --> 02:40:40,820
Obvious?

3838
02:40:40,840 --> 02:40:41,720
In general?

3839
02:40:42,140 --> 02:40:44,160
Cause I never knew he was actually a cat.

3840
02:40:46,860 --> 02:40:48,320
What do you think he was?

3841
02:40:49,640 --> 02:40:51,860
He sort of looks like a dog, too.

3842
02:40:52,040 --> 02:40:53,980
Like, you know, like an angry, angry dog.

3843
02:40:53,980 --> 02:40:54,060
Why?

3844
02:40:57,720 --> 02:40:58,640
Yeah, I'm ready.

3845
02:41:08,100 --> 02:41:08,840
He looks...

3846
02:41:08,840 --> 02:41:10,460
He looks a lot like a dog, too.

3847
02:41:15,810 --> 02:41:16,170
Alright.

3848
02:41:16,510 --> 02:41:19,310
It's a small one after all.

3849
02:41:19,590 --> 02:41:20,450
Oh, you didn't tell...

3850
02:41:20,450 --> 02:41:22,030
This is the Wii portion of the game.

3851
02:41:24,250 --> 02:41:25,370
Like the...

3852
02:41:25,370 --> 02:41:27,250
The crosshair for this.

3853
02:41:27,710 --> 02:41:29,430
That's where I would point my Wii at.

3854
02:41:29,850 --> 02:41:30,590
My Wii mode.

3855
02:41:31,730 --> 02:41:32,750
Is he behind me?

3856
02:41:34,010 --> 02:41:34,970
Oh, there's...

3857
02:41:34,970 --> 02:41:36,010
Alright, let's go.

3858
02:41:38,810 --> 02:41:39,970
Hello.

3859
02:41:40,770 --> 02:41:41,850
Oh my god.

3860
02:41:43,470 --> 02:41:44,870
Reach the crosshair.

3861
02:41:45,550 --> 02:41:46,410
How do I reach it?

3862
02:41:47,510 --> 02:41:48,410
Oh.

3863
02:41:48,670 --> 02:41:49,770
Wait, what?

3864
02:41:50,190 --> 02:41:50,830
Oh!

3865
02:41:51,570 --> 02:41:53,170
I'll give you fingers!

3866
02:41:55,890 --> 02:41:57,050
Friendship!

3867
02:41:57,770 --> 02:41:58,790
Friend!

3868
02:42:00,690 --> 02:42:01,850
Friend!

3869
02:42:05,390 --> 02:42:06,630
Be my...

3870
02:42:06,630 --> 02:42:07,170
Oh my god.

3871
02:42:07,590 --> 02:42:08,990
Be my friend!

3872
02:42:09,990 --> 02:42:10,610
Please!

3873
02:42:11,070 --> 02:42:12,430
Be my friend!

3874
02:42:15,630 --> 02:42:16,570
Oh my god.

3875
02:42:16,670 --> 02:42:17,930
I don't know if he's gonna be my friend.

3876
02:42:19,800 --> 02:42:21,230
Be my friend!

3877
02:42:29,150 --> 02:42:32,070
I can fix you!

3878
02:42:32,950 --> 02:42:36,550
I can fix you!

3879
02:42:36,550 --> 02:42:37,270
I'll

3880
02:42:42,380 --> 02:42:43,440
fix you!

3881
02:42:54,550 --> 02:42:56,930
I'll fix you!

3882
02:42:58,370 --> 02:43:00,710
I can't hear a bear's stare.

3883
02:43:01,750 --> 02:43:02,850
Wait a minute.

3884
02:43:03,230 --> 02:43:03,370
Wait!

3885
02:43:04,090 --> 02:43:05,330
He fucking...

3886
02:43:05,330 --> 02:43:06,510
Oh my god.

3887
02:43:06,510 --> 02:43:07,610
Is this like, time?

3888
02:43:08,030 --> 02:43:09,690
I talk too long?!

3889
02:43:09,690 --> 02:43:11,070
That's a thing?!

3890
02:43:12,530 --> 02:43:14,550
I didn't know you could take too long!

3891
02:43:17,840 --> 02:43:19,860
I just wanted to be friends!

3892
02:43:24,900 --> 02:43:26,900
Please, I'm recharging my friendship meter!

3893
02:43:28,720 --> 02:43:29,340
Please!

3894
02:43:32,660 --> 02:43:36,450
Friend B!

3895
02:43:41,900 --> 02:43:43,840
Please, please, please, please.

3896
02:43:44,060 --> 02:43:45,180
I didn't know.

3897
02:43:45,400 --> 02:43:47,480
I didn't know my friendship meters.

3898
02:43:48,640 --> 02:43:52,200
I'm trying so hard to be his friend, God, I swear to God.

3899
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:57,860
Please, please, please!

3900
02:43:58,380 --> 02:43:59,820
Are we friends now?

3901
02:44:00,340 --> 02:44:02,340
Oh my God, we're friends now!

3902
02:44:04,660 --> 02:44:05,320
Hello!

3903
02:44:06,200 --> 02:44:06,860
Friend!

3904
02:44:11,470 --> 02:44:14,570
I'm afraid I was out of my head for a bit there.

3905
02:44:14,810 --> 02:44:15,150
Sorry!

3906
02:44:16,750 --> 02:44:17,410
Yay!

3907
02:44:20,650 --> 02:44:21,950
We're friends now!

3908
02:44:25,010 --> 02:44:27,130
Sorry for almost trying to kill you!

3909
02:44:27,350 --> 02:44:28,150
Just friend things!

3910
02:44:30,430 --> 02:44:34,330
Your pain can change based on how you deal with important characters in Wasteland.

3911
02:44:34,850 --> 02:44:35,510
Oh, yeah!

3912
02:44:43,130 --> 02:44:43,570
Alright.

3913
02:44:43,570 --> 02:44:44,010
Nice.

3914
02:44:46,070 --> 02:44:47,830
He's just trying to be a silly friend.

3915
02:44:48,650 --> 02:44:49,210
Alright, travel?

3916
02:44:49,410 --> 02:44:49,810
Yeah, I'm ready.

3917
02:44:50,910 --> 02:44:52,710
Sorry for trying to kill you earlier.

3918
02:44:53,150 --> 02:44:53,670
Hee hee!

3919
02:44:56,230 --> 02:44:56,830
Just...

3920
02:44:56,830 --> 02:44:58,150
Just a little joke.

3921
02:44:58,530 --> 02:44:58,970
You know?

3922
02:44:58,970 --> 02:44:59,070
Oh!

3923
02:45:07,800 --> 02:45:09,580
Oswald called you as best as you could.

3924
02:45:09,820 --> 02:45:11,920
He wanted those characters to be happy.

3925
02:45:12,700 --> 02:45:15,740
Characters that world stopped watching and stopped loving.

3926
02:45:16,520 --> 02:45:20,500
Rough traps, any extras, anyone characters left on the drawing board.

3927
02:45:20,980 --> 02:45:22,760
Most lived in Oswald's recreation.

3928
02:45:23,080 --> 02:45:25,400
He sets up shops, an ice cream pile there.

3929
02:45:25,400 --> 02:45:25,460
What?

3930
02:45:25,560 --> 02:45:27,340
It was home before.

3931
02:45:28,320 --> 02:45:29,480
Before what?

3932
02:45:29,820 --> 02:45:30,780
Before what?

3933
02:45:31,620 --> 02:45:31,840
Before what?

3934
02:45:31,840 --> 02:45:33,700
Before the thinner disaster.

3935
02:45:35,480 --> 02:45:36,500
Oh no!

3936
02:45:36,720 --> 02:45:39,300
That's when my life went out of Wasteland.

3937
02:45:39,660 --> 02:45:42,040
Who could have done such a thing?

3938
02:45:44,700 --> 02:45:46,340
Oh my god!

3939
02:45:47,640 --> 02:45:48,560
Oh god!

3940
02:45:48,560 --> 02:45:48,600
Oh god!

3941
02:45:48,700 --> 02:45:50,720
A terrible person did this!

3942
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:55,360
That's when the blot arrived in his flunkies.

3943
02:45:57,000 --> 02:46:00,640
Thus is what's left of Oswald's creation, Mickey.

3944
02:46:01,200 --> 02:46:03,620
Welcome to Mean Street.

3945
02:46:04,500 --> 02:46:05,260
Mickey!

3946
02:46:05,600 --> 02:46:05,960
Gus!

3947
02:46:09,860 --> 02:46:11,700
A monster, no doubt!

3948
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,420
We should jail that fucker!

3949
02:46:15,360 --> 02:46:16,560
Hello, Uncle Gus!

3950
02:46:17,360 --> 02:46:18,460
Good to see you, Marcus.

3951
02:46:18,980 --> 02:46:22,040
By any chance, have you seen Oswald lately?

3952
02:46:22,540 --> 02:46:26,660
Last time I saw him, he was headed towards the projector screens at the end of the street.

3953
02:46:27,060 --> 02:46:29,980
But those have been broken for a long time now.

3954
02:46:31,060 --> 02:46:33,500
If I can get that projector screen ready again.

3955
02:46:33,760 --> 02:46:35,600
If you can get me a pair of gears.

3956
02:46:36,760 --> 02:46:39,420
Horse can probably be found in the detective agency.

3957
02:46:39,720 --> 02:46:41,240
I know he has one.

3958
02:46:41,920 --> 02:46:43,720
He used to brag about his gear.

3959
02:46:43,900 --> 02:46:46,000
He's usually hanging around the city hall.

3960
02:46:46,640 --> 02:46:48,640
I'll be waiting outside a penny arcade.

3961
02:46:49,120 --> 02:46:50,880
Come see me when you have those gears.

3962
02:46:51,720 --> 02:46:56,920
Yeah, we must find the perpetrators who did such a heinous crime.

3963
02:46:57,760 --> 02:46:59,940
How dare they...

3964
02:46:59,940 --> 02:47:01,280
Poor sinner here.

3965
02:47:03,180 --> 02:47:03,940
Okay.

3966
02:47:05,620 --> 02:47:09,320
Who could do such a fucked up thing to these poor people?

3967
02:47:12,680 --> 02:47:13,420
Hello, guys.

3968
02:47:16,620 --> 02:47:17,880
I'm so sorry!

3969
02:47:28,110 --> 02:47:29,570
He's okay, he's fixed now.

3970
02:47:33,910 --> 02:47:34,850
Guys, it's okay.

3971
02:47:35,030 --> 02:47:35,590
He's fixed now.

3972
02:47:35,910 --> 02:47:36,510
He's fixed.

3973
02:47:36,930 --> 02:47:37,530
He's...

3974
02:47:37,530 --> 02:47:37,830
He's...

3975
02:47:38,470 --> 02:47:39,710
Guys, nothing happened.

3976
02:47:40,130 --> 02:47:41,150
Nothing happened.

3977
02:47:41,370 --> 02:47:41,630
He's...

3978
02:47:41,630 --> 02:47:42,630
He's okay.

3979
02:47:43,210 --> 02:47:43,630
Nothing happened.

3980
02:47:45,090 --> 02:47:46,290
Nothing happened.

3981
02:47:46,970 --> 02:47:47,450
Nothing happened.

3982
02:47:47,450 --> 02:47:47,490
What?

3983
02:47:48,790 --> 02:47:50,330
Guys, it's okay.

3984
02:47:51,190 --> 02:47:52,250
It's not...

3985
02:47:52,250 --> 02:47:52,930
Look at him.

3986
02:47:53,110 --> 02:47:53,630
Look at him.

3987
02:47:53,770 --> 02:47:54,570
Nothing happened.

3988
02:47:54,930 --> 02:47:55,050
Look.

3989
02:47:55,310 --> 02:47:55,870
He's happy.

3990
02:47:56,730 --> 02:47:57,090
He's...

3991
02:47:57,090 --> 02:47:57,930
Look at him.

3992
02:47:57,970 --> 02:47:58,890
He's so happy.

3993
02:47:59,130 --> 02:48:00,170
Nothing happened.

3994
02:48:00,170 --> 02:48:00,250
What happened?

3995
02:48:04,550 --> 02:48:06,310
He's so happy.

3996
02:48:14,200 --> 02:48:16,740
They're different versions from different stories.

3997
02:48:18,460 --> 02:48:19,480
Like me.

3998
02:48:21,200 --> 02:48:23,100
I thought these folks were forgotten.

3999
02:48:23,360 --> 02:48:23,980
I never forgot.

4000
02:48:24,280 --> 02:48:25,500
You, Big Pete, Bad Pete!

4001
02:48:28,440 --> 02:48:32,360
Big Bad Pete, Pete Pan, Small Pete, Petronic.

4002
02:48:32,620 --> 02:48:34,580
This place has got lots of me.

4003
02:48:35,320 --> 02:48:37,780
We got things done in Wasteland Sea.

4004
02:48:38,120 --> 02:48:41,260
So work with us and nobody will mess with you.

4005
02:48:47,940 --> 02:48:50,520
I'm Big Bad Pete, the one and only.

4006
02:48:50,840 --> 02:48:53,120
I'm the go-to guy around here.

4007
02:48:53,120 --> 02:48:54,860
And don't you forget it.

4008
02:48:55,040 --> 02:48:57,140
Nothing gets done if I ain't around.

4009
02:48:57,600 --> 02:49:03,520
And I hears about everything, including your running with Small Pete back in the world of Gremlins.

4010
02:49:04,220 --> 02:49:06,220
So here, have some e-tickets.

4011
02:49:06,400 --> 02:49:09,140
But don't think this means I decided to like you.

4012
02:49:09,980 --> 02:49:12,020
Oh nice, I got Small Pete.

4013
02:49:12,160 --> 02:49:16,200
Small Pete may be a real chowder head, but I'm glad you helped him.

4014
02:49:16,200 --> 02:49:19,880
Even though I know you're in need of a gear that I'm rumored to have.

4015
02:49:20,300 --> 02:49:22,180
Well, here's the deal on the gear.

4016
02:49:22,660 --> 02:49:27,320
Big Mouth Gilda is always bragging about fascists.

4017
02:49:27,600 --> 02:49:29,800
So, I set up a race for her.

4018
02:49:30,200 --> 02:49:32,200
Told her I'd give her a prize if she could beat it.

4019
02:49:32,440 --> 02:49:34,400
Seeing as how I didn't think she could.

4020
02:49:34,760 --> 02:49:36,220
Well anyways, she did.

4021
02:49:36,400 --> 02:49:38,480
But we never agreed on no prize.

4022
02:49:38,640 --> 02:49:40,840
So I gave her that worthless gear.

4023
02:49:41,220 --> 02:49:41,340
Ha!

4024
02:49:42,100 --> 02:49:44,440
Bottom line is, I don't got it no more.

4025
02:49:44,440 --> 02:49:47,540
The girl over by the firehouse station does.

4026
02:49:47,880 --> 02:49:50,200
So I can't help her even if I wanted to.

4027
02:49:50,440 --> 02:49:51,640
But maybe she can.

4028
02:49:52,160 --> 02:49:53,820
Otherwise, tough love.

4029
02:49:55,660 --> 02:49:57,340
Oh, oh, so I don't know.

4030
02:49:57,540 --> 02:49:58,500
Oh, that's nice.

4031
02:49:58,740 --> 02:50:00,300
Okay, but like what if I go...

4032
02:50:01,940 --> 02:50:03,520
He's right there.

4033
02:50:06,340 --> 02:50:09,800
It would be a shame if something happens to that man.

4034
02:50:09,800 --> 02:50:11,160
Give me a...

4035
02:50:16,020 --> 02:50:18,140
Guys, I'm not a criminal, guys.

4036
02:50:18,380 --> 02:50:19,560
I didn't do nothing.

4037
02:50:20,700 --> 02:50:21,300
Uh...

4038
02:50:21,300 --> 02:50:23,240
Liam, thank you for the super chat.

4039
02:50:23,380 --> 02:50:23,720
Thank you.

4040
02:50:23,860 --> 02:50:24,500
Thank you.

4041
02:50:26,060 --> 02:50:28,960
There's only so many little accidents that can happen.

4042
02:50:29,160 --> 02:50:32,540
But they already stopped being either little or accidents.

4043
02:50:33,420 --> 02:50:34,720
What did I do?

4044
02:50:35,520 --> 02:50:37,520
Hey there, I'm Gilda.

4045
02:50:37,840 --> 02:50:39,960
I'm a little bit adventurous like yourself.

4046
02:50:40,920 --> 02:50:43,160
I just got back from the Mickey Junk Mountain.

4047
02:50:43,380 --> 02:50:45,080
That scary place.

4048
02:50:46,480 --> 02:50:50,060
I was camping in the old collector's hut when Lotlin showed up.

4049
02:50:50,380 --> 02:50:51,540
Had a good old fast.

4050
02:50:51,980 --> 02:50:53,500
Oh, being up on that ledge was safe.

4051
02:50:53,560 --> 02:50:54,280
But I was wrong.

4052
02:50:54,520 --> 02:50:56,600
Left my prize climbing axe behind.

4053
02:50:57,060 --> 02:50:57,780
Oh well.

4054
02:50:58,180 --> 02:50:59,760
Maybe I'll come across another one soon.

4055
02:50:59,760 --> 02:51:01,060
But anyway...

4056
02:51:01,060 --> 02:51:03,000
Okay, so I need to find her lost axe.

4057
02:51:03,820 --> 02:51:04,160
Okay.

4058
02:51:04,580 --> 02:51:06,540
You want to try my time trial race?

4059
02:51:06,760 --> 02:51:10,140
I smashed Pete's gold time and he gave me this gear as a reward.

4060
02:51:10,440 --> 02:51:14,020
If you could beat my time, I could pass the gear along to you.

4061
02:51:14,340 --> 02:51:18,940
Follow the guardian and reach the checkered class flag before the clock runs up.

4062
02:51:19,380 --> 02:51:20,060
Yeah, sure.

4063
02:51:20,300 --> 02:51:21,100
Can't be that difficult.

4064
02:51:21,880 --> 02:51:22,400
Okay.

4065
02:51:22,720 --> 02:51:23,720
Let's get started.

4066
02:51:24,200 --> 02:51:24,720
Ready?

4067
02:51:25,560 --> 02:51:26,080
Three...

4068
02:51:27,060 --> 02:51:27,580
Two...

4069
02:51:27,580 --> 02:51:28,240
One...

4070
02:51:28,240 --> 02:51:28,780
Go!

4071
02:51:29,120 --> 02:51:29,520
Okay.

4072
02:51:32,560 --> 02:51:33,060
Okay...

4073
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:34,500
Here...

4074
02:51:34,500 --> 02:51:35,300
I don't put up.

4075
02:51:35,640 --> 02:51:36,020
I don't put up.

4076
02:51:36,160 --> 02:51:37,420
I don't put up.

4077
02:51:37,540 --> 02:51:37,740
I don't put up.

4078
02:51:38,260 --> 02:51:39,040
I don't put up.

4079
02:51:40,580 --> 02:51:41,080
Okay.

4080
02:51:42,700 --> 02:51:46,260
Oh, the hard part is just I don't know where the race ends.

4081
02:51:50,160 --> 02:51:51,080
Okay, down.

4082
02:51:53,600 --> 02:51:55,320
Oh my god, there's more over here?

4083
02:51:56,960 --> 02:51:58,940
Oh my god, this is a big map.

4084
02:52:02,060 --> 02:52:03,160
Oh, there's more!

4085
02:52:03,280 --> 02:52:03,860
Oh, what?

4086
02:52:04,900 --> 02:52:06,280
Great job, Mickey!

4087
02:52:06,540 --> 02:52:08,440
As promised, here's the gear you wanted!

4088
02:52:09,020 --> 02:52:10,140
You want a gear from Gilda?

4089
02:52:10,220 --> 02:52:14,480
Now let's go to Horus at the detective agency to see about the gear he has!

4090
02:52:15,680 --> 02:52:18,580
Okay, so I need to find an axe for Gilda.

4091
02:52:19,920 --> 02:52:23,780
Let me paint this a little bit so I can hide my crimes.

4092
02:52:25,640 --> 02:52:27,340
Nothing bad happened!

4093
02:52:28,040 --> 02:52:29,860
Nothing bad happened!

4094
02:52:30,260 --> 02:52:31,620
I didn't do nothing!

4095
02:52:32,300 --> 02:52:34,400
I didn't do nothing!

4096
02:52:37,320 --> 02:52:45,100
Anyway, oh, these are like... Oh my god, okay, I'm missing 1, 2, 3, 4, so I completed two worlds already.

4097
02:52:45,880 --> 02:52:45,960
Oh.

4098
02:52:46,820 --> 02:52:49,980
Kiteam Museum should be funny, but this is kind of sad these days.

4099
02:52:50,400 --> 02:52:52,120
Nothing a little paint can cover up, right?

4100
02:52:55,540 --> 02:52:56,880
Mark, thank you, Super Chat.

4101
02:52:57,040 --> 02:52:57,620
Thank you, thank you.

4102
02:52:57,940 --> 02:52:59,800
Oh, what a world, what a world.

4103
02:53:00,880 --> 02:53:02,220
What is this, though?

4104
02:53:06,410 --> 02:53:08,950
Oh my, is that who I think it is?

4105
02:53:09,030 --> 02:53:11,790
My goodness, it's you, Mickey Mouse!

4106
02:53:12,890 --> 02:53:14,310
Oh, that's me!

4107
02:53:18,050 --> 02:53:19,810
Oh, you didn't see nothing!

4108
02:53:20,550 --> 02:53:21,070
Hahaha!

4109
02:53:22,250 --> 02:53:23,670
How have you ended up here?

4110
02:53:27,910 --> 02:53:28,950
Alright, let's...

4111
02:53:28,950 --> 02:53:30,070
Where are you?

4112
02:53:30,590 --> 02:53:32,210
Welcome to my shop, Mickey!

4113
02:53:32,410 --> 02:53:34,390
Oh, there's the place where I can buy stuff!

4114
02:53:35,790 --> 02:53:36,910
Visited the home.

4115
02:53:37,150 --> 02:53:38,490
I arrived in Wonderland.

4116
02:53:39,870 --> 02:53:40,710
Wait, what?

4117
02:53:41,010 --> 02:53:42,570
Or, is this like...

4118
02:53:42,570 --> 02:53:44,150
All the stuff I didn't get?

4119
02:53:44,510 --> 02:53:45,030
Oh!

4120
02:53:45,030 --> 02:53:47,390
Oh my god, they have the pin...

4121
02:53:47,390 --> 02:53:49,010
Oh my god, they have the fucking pins.

4122
02:53:49,210 --> 02:53:51,010
They brought the pin collecting here, too.

4123
02:53:51,490 --> 02:53:54,110
They actually brought the pin collecting here.

4124
02:53:58,370 --> 02:54:00,290
Oh, I could get rid of it, okay.

4125
02:54:00,510 --> 02:54:01,390
We're not getting rid of that.

4126
02:54:01,510 --> 02:54:02,710
We're not bad people, guys.

4127
02:54:10,640 --> 02:54:13,320
Welcome to the Horse Caller Investigation, can I?

4128
02:54:13,640 --> 02:54:14,400
Oh my!

4129
02:54:14,800 --> 02:54:16,680
Mickey, do you remember me?

4130
02:54:16,960 --> 02:54:18,180
Horse, Horse Caller?

4131
02:54:21,840 --> 02:54:23,880
I was in the Fire Fighters!

4132
02:54:24,100 --> 02:54:26,420
The Barnyard Broadcast!

4133
02:54:27,040 --> 02:54:28,180
The Band!

4134
02:54:28,380 --> 02:54:28,640
The Band!

4135
02:54:28,640 --> 02:54:29,020
Oh, yeah!

4136
02:54:29,360 --> 02:54:29,880
That one!

4137
02:54:30,300 --> 02:54:30,760
I love...

4138
02:54:30,760 --> 02:54:31,440
I like that one.

4139
02:54:31,580 --> 02:54:32,800
The band concert one.

4140
02:54:33,780 --> 02:54:35,340
Don't remember, huh?

4141
02:54:35,640 --> 02:54:36,520
That's alright.

4142
02:54:36,880 --> 02:54:38,220
Nobody else did.

4143
02:54:38,440 --> 02:54:39,720
Taiwan up here.

4144
02:54:40,060 --> 02:54:42,180
Same as everyone else.

4145
02:54:42,860 --> 02:54:44,080
No, Horace!

4146
02:54:44,100 --> 02:54:45,580
I remember you!

4147
02:54:47,080 --> 02:54:49,840
Here in the wasteland, I'm...

4148
02:54:50,300 --> 02:54:51,320
an ace detective.

4149
02:54:51,720 --> 02:54:53,200
At least, I like the bee.

4150
02:54:53,600 --> 02:54:56,900
Haven't solved the case in years, but you need an investigator?

4151
02:54:57,480 --> 02:54:58,580
I'm your guy.

4152
02:54:59,320 --> 02:55:00,700
Business is down these days.

4153
02:55:00,900 --> 02:55:02,900
I'm sure it will pick up any time now.

4154
02:55:04,280 --> 02:55:08,600
I'm one of yours that is used to power up the projector screen machine to Oz Town.

4155
02:55:08,980 --> 02:55:12,700
I can give it to you, but I need you to do something for me first.

4156
02:55:13,360 --> 02:55:14,480
Such a downer.

4157
02:55:14,740 --> 02:55:16,200
Whatever his name is.

4158
02:55:17,400 --> 02:55:22,220
Casey the Emporium ordered a book from you a while ago, but never returned it.

4159
02:55:23,120 --> 02:55:24,660
Can you go see if he still has it?

4160
02:55:24,660 --> 02:55:26,820
Bring it back to me, and...

4161
02:55:26,820 --> 02:55:28,000
I'll give you the gear.

4162
02:55:29,220 --> 02:55:29,580
Alright.

4163
02:55:30,020 --> 02:55:31,360
Recover the Horace book.

4164
02:55:32,260 --> 02:55:33,560
Okay, we can do that.

4165
02:55:35,040 --> 02:55:36,440
It's like over here.

4166
02:55:41,800 --> 02:55:42,400
Alright.

4167
02:55:44,200 --> 02:55:46,660
I understand that you're looking for horrors this book?

4168
02:55:46,980 --> 02:55:48,360
Well, that's a problem.

4169
02:55:48,660 --> 02:55:53,220
I finished reading it a while ago, and lent it to Pauline, the ice cream pot owner.

4170
02:55:53,620 --> 02:55:56,140
His shop is just down the street from here.

4171
02:55:56,500 --> 02:55:58,020
You should go ask him about it.

4172
02:55:58,120 --> 02:55:59,840
Okay, we gotta go ask Pauline now.

4173
02:55:59,960 --> 02:56:00,580
Oh my god.

4174
02:56:00,720 --> 02:56:02,280
This is a fetch quest right now.

4175
02:56:03,600 --> 02:56:05,280
So many of these, like...

4176
02:56:06,140 --> 02:56:08,040
Like, default characters here.

4177
02:56:09,300 --> 02:56:10,840
Oh, this is another Casey.

4178
02:56:11,860 --> 02:56:14,040
Well, he had the muscle flexed him.

4179
02:56:14,320 --> 02:56:16,360
Folks around here will get out of the way.

4180
02:56:19,620 --> 02:56:20,720
No, don't do it.

4181
02:56:20,720 --> 02:56:21,540
Don't...

4182
02:56:24,540 --> 02:56:25,560
Don't do it.

4183
02:56:25,840 --> 02:56:26,880
Don't do it.

4184
02:56:31,380 --> 02:56:32,740
I didn't do it.

4185
02:56:32,960 --> 02:56:35,300
I didn't listen to my thoughts.

4186
02:56:37,560 --> 02:56:38,360
Hey there.

4187
02:56:38,600 --> 02:56:39,960
My name is Pauline.

4188
02:56:40,140 --> 02:56:42,200
And I'm the owner of the ice cream parlor.

4189
02:56:42,400 --> 02:56:44,140
Don't listen to the voices.

4190
02:56:45,180 --> 02:56:47,380
Ice cream is hard to come by these days.

4191
02:56:47,560 --> 02:56:49,680
So sometimes I don't have much variety.

4192
02:56:49,680 --> 02:56:51,340
Business has been slow.

4193
02:56:51,640 --> 02:56:53,980
But reading keeps me entertained when there's no customers.

4194
02:56:54,940 --> 02:56:59,140
That's why I also sell enhancements and filters for your photo mode nowadays.

4195
02:56:59,580 --> 02:57:02,000
You're looking for the book that Casey lent me?

4196
02:57:02,420 --> 02:57:04,320
I wasn't quite finished with it yet.

4197
02:57:04,500 --> 02:57:06,200
But I suppose you can have it anyway.

4198
02:57:06,860 --> 02:57:07,840
Stop by again.

4199
02:57:08,980 --> 02:57:10,680
Okay, so what are the filters?

4200
02:57:11,320 --> 02:57:12,540
A delicious high...

4201
02:57:12,540 --> 02:57:13,880
Oh, I want an ice cream.

4202
02:57:16,620 --> 02:57:18,660
I'll buy this ice cream just because I can.

4203
02:57:19,680 --> 02:57:20,420
What does it do?

4204
02:57:21,360 --> 02:57:23,120
I have one ice cream.

4205
02:57:23,640 --> 02:57:23,940
Okay.

4206
02:57:24,780 --> 02:57:27,180
So what does this one ice cream do?

4207
02:57:27,680 --> 02:57:29,480
Let's put this ice cream back.

4208
02:57:32,340 --> 02:57:33,820
Oh, okay.

4209
02:57:33,820 --> 02:57:33,820
Oh,

4210
02:57:47,610 --> 02:57:47,610
okay, so it's...

4211
02:57:47,610 --> 02:57:48,250
got your book.

4212
02:57:49,750 --> 02:57:50,490
Great!

4213
02:57:50,750 --> 02:57:52,290
You recovered my book.

4214
02:57:52,450 --> 02:57:53,830
How to be a detective.

4215
02:57:54,470 --> 02:57:57,470
Now I'm almost ready to reopen my agency.

4216
02:57:58,190 --> 02:58:01,330
Hopefully, things go better for me this time.

4217
02:58:02,990 --> 02:58:05,490
That's why I was here as a gear unit.

4218
02:58:05,950 --> 02:58:08,370
Don't be too hard on Oswald.

4219
02:58:08,870 --> 02:58:10,050
He really does try.

4220
02:58:10,830 --> 02:58:12,030
Yay, we got, guys.

4221
02:58:12,630 --> 02:58:14,130
We got more guys.

4222
02:58:15,090 --> 02:58:16,570
Nah, both gears, Mickey.

4223
02:58:17,090 --> 02:58:20,190
Let's hurry back to the Gremlin Marcus.

4224
02:58:20,890 --> 02:58:21,310
Okay, guys.

4225
02:58:22,230 --> 02:58:24,850
Did I... Good ending, right?

4226
02:58:24,850 --> 02:58:24,850
Okay.

4227
02:58:30,570 --> 02:58:33,250
I'm still getting the good ending, right, guys?

4228
02:58:34,570 --> 02:58:35,910
It's still happening, right?

4229
02:58:36,870 --> 02:58:37,710
Only, sure.

4230
02:58:38,170 --> 02:58:39,010
I haven't snored with since.

4231
02:58:39,230 --> 02:58:40,330
Oh, it felt like forever.

4232
02:58:40,710 --> 02:58:42,630
You should talk to Pete and Horace.

4233
02:58:43,230 --> 02:58:43,690
Yeah.

4234
02:58:45,550 --> 02:58:46,650
Oh, okay, guys.

4235
02:58:47,110 --> 02:58:47,970
Guys, look at that.

4236
02:58:48,050 --> 02:58:49,910
No consequences, guys.

4237
02:58:49,910 --> 02:58:52,270
No consequences.

4238
02:58:53,150 --> 02:58:54,310
At all.

4239
02:58:58,690 --> 02:58:59,510
Unfortunately.

4240
02:59:04,550 --> 02:59:05,370
Yay!

4241
02:59:06,890 --> 02:59:09,690
We can still get the good ending, guys.

4242
02:59:10,450 --> 02:59:11,250
Yippee.

4243
02:59:13,350 --> 02:59:16,710
Okay, so I assume he's like... Okay, he's over there.

4244
02:59:19,730 --> 02:59:20,250
Alright.

4245
02:59:21,710 --> 02:59:22,850
Let's go this way.

4246
02:59:23,790 --> 02:59:25,210
I can still be a hero.

4247
02:59:25,510 --> 02:59:26,630
I'm still a hero.

4248
02:59:31,550 --> 02:59:33,210
I'll be a Mickey Mouse.

4249
02:59:33,430 --> 02:59:34,530
Now I've seen it all!

4250
02:59:34,710 --> 02:59:35,350
Oh, there he is.

4251
02:59:37,310 --> 02:59:38,830
You covered both the gears?

4252
02:59:39,230 --> 02:59:39,750
Fantastic!

4253
02:59:40,910 --> 02:59:43,710
There's only one more thing yet to do to get this thing running.

4254
02:59:44,210 --> 02:59:49,310
You see, when a machine broke, its energy was scattered around the park in the form of Powers Park.

4255
02:59:49,950 --> 02:59:52,830
Famous people have picked him up, and some have yet to be found.

4256
02:59:53,470 --> 02:59:56,570
We will need one of them to start up the Oztown projector screen.

4257
02:59:57,050 --> 02:59:59,370
I'm pretty sure I saw one on display at the museum.

4258
02:59:59,770 --> 03:00:00,850
You should go have a look.

4259
03:00:01,150 --> 03:00:02,070
I saw that.

4260
03:00:02,270 --> 03:00:04,590
Try visiting with Casey the Emporium.

4261
03:00:04,590 --> 03:00:06,670
I think I saw him with one earlier.

4262
03:00:07,510 --> 03:00:08,890
Okay, oh my god.

4263
03:00:09,150 --> 03:00:09,850
Go back.

4264
03:00:12,810 --> 03:00:14,170
Come one, come all.

4265
03:00:14,330 --> 03:00:17,270
Come see our latest cartoon escape bids.

4266
03:00:17,770 --> 03:00:18,950
Hey, you're an adventurous type.

4267
03:00:19,250 --> 03:00:20,550
We always need more cartoons here.

4268
03:00:20,910 --> 03:00:23,890
If you haven't found anything during travel, bring them up for a reward.

4269
03:00:24,430 --> 03:00:25,650
You can see the stars here.

4270
03:00:26,010 --> 03:00:28,710
Sometimes we have famous patrons, including you, of course.

4271
03:00:29,230 --> 03:00:32,250
Feel free to step inside and play through these exciting moments again.

4272
03:00:32,250 --> 03:00:34,870
Oh, this is when I got the film reel.

4273
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:39,820
Oh, nice.

4274
03:00:40,020 --> 03:00:40,180
Here.

4275
03:00:40,660 --> 03:00:41,480
Oh, I get paid.

4276
03:00:42,780 --> 03:00:43,020
Wait.

4277
03:00:43,200 --> 03:00:44,080
Oh my god!

4278
03:00:44,220 --> 03:00:44,620
Flashbang!

4279
03:00:45,040 --> 03:00:46,860
I was not expecting that.

4280
03:00:47,380 --> 03:00:48,260
Holy shit.

4281
03:00:49,940 --> 03:00:52,040
I was not expecting that flashbang.

4282
03:00:52,920 --> 03:00:53,640
What's this?

4283
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:54,320
Oh, hey.

4284
03:00:54,540 --> 03:00:55,160
Steamboat Willie.

4285
03:00:56,720 --> 03:00:57,240
Yes.

4286
03:00:57,500 --> 03:00:57,740
Oh!

4287
03:00:57,940 --> 03:00:59,640
Is this back for the 2D stuff?

4288
03:01:01,360 --> 03:01:02,220
Steamboat Willie?

4289
03:01:03,600 --> 03:01:06,100
Oh, it's me replaying this.

4290
03:01:06,520 --> 03:01:06,620
Wait.

4291
03:01:06,680 --> 03:01:07,220
How do I...

4292
03:01:09,040 --> 03:01:09,520
Wait.

4293
03:01:09,580 --> 03:01:10,100
I wanna leave.

4294
03:01:12,340 --> 03:01:13,060
Oh my god.

4295
03:01:13,160 --> 03:01:13,460
To finish.

4296
03:01:13,560 --> 03:01:13,700
Okay.

4297
03:01:13,900 --> 03:01:16,160
I thought I was watching the movie.

4298
03:01:16,740 --> 03:01:17,640
But that's fine.

4299
03:01:17,640 --> 03:01:19,220
I can fast-track this.

4300
03:01:20,700 --> 03:01:21,460
What's...

4301
03:01:28,920 --> 03:01:30,460
Oh my God!

4302
03:01:32,040 --> 03:01:33,180
Losing people....

4303
03:01:36,580 --> 03:01:37,340
Alright.

4304
03:01:38,140 --> 03:01:38,660
Yeah.

4305
03:01:38,880 --> 03:01:40,560
I just wanna know what that was.

4306
03:01:40,780 --> 03:01:42,680
I thought I was watching a movie!

4307
03:01:42,680 --> 03:01:45,540
I was like, oh my god, I get to watch Team Bowie!

4308
03:01:47,720 --> 03:01:50,460
But it was just to, like...

4309
03:01:50,460 --> 03:01:55,000
Oh, yeah, it was just to, like, play... replay the 2D portions.

4310
03:01:55,240 --> 03:01:57,120
Okay, now I know what this is.

4311
03:01:59,320 --> 03:02:00,480
Okay, so...

4312
03:02:00,480 --> 03:02:06,200
There's one, two, three, four, five, six more worlds left.

4313
03:02:06,500 --> 03:02:07,280
Okay, wow.

4314
03:02:07,820 --> 03:02:08,760
Oh, my God.

4315
03:02:14,920 --> 03:02:15,480
Alright.

4316
03:02:17,460 --> 03:02:21,900
The way he said it, it seemed like I had to just watch it there now.

4317
03:02:24,080 --> 03:02:26,120
Okay, let's go...

4318
03:02:27,200 --> 03:02:28,080
Get our...

4319
03:02:28,080 --> 03:02:29,400
Let's go get this power spark.

4320
03:02:32,840 --> 03:02:34,120
Give me the power spark!

4321
03:02:34,900 --> 03:02:36,220
Do you have one new exhibit?

4322
03:02:36,560 --> 03:02:37,220
See it glowing?

4323
03:02:37,900 --> 03:02:38,260
What?

4324
03:02:38,460 --> 03:02:41,180
You need that crazy glowing orb in the display case?

4325
03:02:41,400 --> 03:02:45,680
I'll let you have a power spark if you can find something more interesting to replace it.

4326
03:02:45,680 --> 03:02:48,660
All sorts of things get left behind at the cinema.

4327
03:02:49,160 --> 03:02:49,820
You should talk...

4328
03:02:49,820 --> 03:02:50,600
God damn it!

4329
03:02:51,560 --> 03:02:52,940
God fucking damn it!

4330
03:02:53,020 --> 03:02:53,120
Okay.

4331
03:02:54,060 --> 03:02:56,320
Alright, let's ask him for the other one.

4332
03:02:58,160 --> 03:03:00,140
Why don't you guys ask each other?

4333
03:03:00,240 --> 03:03:01,840
It's, like, five steps away!

4334
03:03:02,540 --> 03:03:05,180
I locked myself out of my back room again.

4335
03:03:05,500 --> 03:03:08,680
I think I dropped my key near Polly's ice cream parlor.

4336
03:03:09,020 --> 03:03:11,260
The key must be somewhere around the front of the store.

4337
03:03:11,700 --> 03:03:13,300
Could you go look around for me?

4338
03:03:13,760 --> 03:03:14,460
Oh, my...

4339
03:03:14,460 --> 03:03:14,720
Guys.

4340
03:03:14,920 --> 03:03:15,160
Guys.

4341
03:03:15,320 --> 03:03:16,060
It's literally...

4342
03:03:16,640 --> 03:03:17,480
10 steps.

4343
03:03:17,880 --> 03:03:20,180
You could have got your key 10 steps ago.

4344
03:03:24,640 --> 03:03:27,320
Okay, I had to do that to find the key.

4345
03:03:28,940 --> 03:03:30,280
Where the fuck is the key?

4346
03:03:31,460 --> 03:03:32,180
This is...

4347
03:03:32,180 --> 03:03:32,860
Oh, it's right here.

4348
03:03:34,260 --> 03:03:35,720
Wait, is that...

4349
03:03:37,360 --> 03:03:39,480
No, that's just...

4350
03:03:39,480 --> 03:03:40,200
No.

4351
03:03:42,900 --> 03:03:44,180
How do I get up there?

4352
03:03:48,380 --> 03:03:49,760
How do I get up there?

4353
03:03:50,140 --> 03:03:51,340
You said he left it...

4354
03:03:51,340 --> 03:03:52,200
Oh, there's Polly now?

4355
03:03:53,780 --> 03:03:54,400
No?

4356
03:03:54,880 --> 03:03:56,960
Polly, where the fuck is this key?

4357
03:04:01,050 --> 03:04:04,150
He said he left it at Polly's ice cream shop.

4358
03:04:08,250 --> 03:04:09,310
Is it here?

4359
03:04:15,550 --> 03:04:16,270
No?

4360
03:04:18,650 --> 03:04:19,370
Oh!

4361
03:04:20,710 --> 03:04:21,890
I'm so dumb.

4362
03:04:25,330 --> 03:04:26,050
Okay.

4363
03:04:26,770 --> 03:04:28,230
I'll talk to...

4364
03:04:29,270 --> 03:04:31,450
him for the...

4365
03:04:31,450 --> 03:04:34,850
I have a cut list that was left here by Captain Hook himself.

4366
03:04:35,150 --> 03:04:36,570
You're looking for something in the museum?

4367
03:04:37,090 --> 03:04:37,250
Yeah.

4368
03:04:37,590 --> 03:04:39,910
I guess Hook's cut list would be a good exhibit.

4369
03:04:40,210 --> 03:04:43,710
Since you already brought some film strips to me, I'll let you have this for free.

4370
03:04:44,150 --> 03:04:44,670
Okay, nice.

4371
03:04:44,830 --> 03:04:44,990
All right.

4372
03:04:45,370 --> 03:04:45,810
Now...

4373
03:04:45,810 --> 03:04:47,830
That should be almost everything.

4374
03:04:49,430 --> 03:04:50,430
I'm so smart.

4375
03:04:51,630 --> 03:04:53,610
Okay, and then we'll grab this one from here.

4376
03:04:54,130 --> 03:04:55,190
Find my back room key!

4377
03:04:55,450 --> 03:04:57,390
I'll give you something from inside as a reward!

4378
03:04:57,930 --> 03:05:00,070
Hopefully the power spark is okay with you.

4379
03:05:00,250 --> 03:05:01,570
All right, and then we give...

4380
03:05:02,030 --> 03:05:02,950
It to her.

4381
03:05:03,430 --> 03:05:04,170
Over here.

4382
03:05:07,010 --> 03:05:07,590
All right.

4383
03:05:08,810 --> 03:05:10,890
Look at this cut list.

4384
03:05:11,410 --> 03:05:12,430
It's quite the specimen.

4385
03:05:12,930 --> 03:05:15,930
I'll gladly trade you the power spark for this fine piece.

4386
03:05:16,910 --> 03:05:17,710
Thanks, Mickey.

4387
03:05:17,950 --> 03:05:19,490
Remember to stop by anytime.

4388
03:05:20,170 --> 03:05:20,850
Okay, nice.

4389
03:05:21,750 --> 03:05:22,210
All right.

4390
03:05:22,210 --> 03:05:24,410
Now we have everything.

4391
03:05:27,430 --> 03:05:29,930
Okay, and then we can get Oztown back.

4392
03:05:32,750 --> 03:05:34,610
You retrieved the power spark.

4393
03:05:34,890 --> 03:05:38,090
Now I can get the projector screen to Oztown working.

4394
03:05:38,650 --> 03:05:40,730
Now let's see what's happening to this device.

4395
03:05:41,610 --> 03:05:42,630
Fiddle here.

4396
03:05:42,990 --> 03:05:43,890
Adjust that.

4397
03:05:45,610 --> 03:05:46,290
Voila!

4398
03:05:46,670 --> 03:05:49,890
A projector screen to Oztown is working perfectly.

4399
03:05:50,690 --> 03:05:51,830
Oh, you're gone.

4400
03:05:52,210 --> 03:05:54,190
I'll try tinkering with the other projector screen.

4401
03:05:54,450 --> 03:05:55,470
Good luck, Mickey.

4402
03:05:55,810 --> 03:05:58,490
And take these e-tickets to help you on your adventure.

4403
03:05:58,990 --> 03:05:59,410
Nice.

4404
03:05:59,990 --> 03:06:01,750
What do I do with these e-tickets?

4405
03:06:04,330 --> 03:06:06,430
I get so many e-tickets for that.

4406
03:06:07,870 --> 03:06:09,170
I don't know what to do.

4407
03:06:10,590 --> 03:06:12,510
I mean, it's just like the audit parks.

4408
03:06:15,980 --> 03:06:16,460
Dad?

4409
03:06:18,180 --> 03:06:20,660
Um, with a few changes, of course.

4410
03:06:22,960 --> 03:06:23,780
Oswald?

4411
03:06:25,760 --> 03:06:27,320
He's like...

4412
03:06:27,320 --> 03:06:27,900
Brother?

4413
03:06:30,520 --> 03:06:32,320
He's like, I have a...

4414
03:06:32,320 --> 03:06:32,840
Brother?

4415
03:06:37,290 --> 03:06:40,210
That's when Mickey found out he has a...

4416
03:06:40,210 --> 03:06:42,030
He has a long forgotten brother.

4417
03:06:44,730 --> 03:06:46,010
Sorry, thank you for the super chat.

4418
03:06:46,110 --> 03:06:46,350
Thank you.

4419
03:06:46,610 --> 03:06:47,130
Thank you.

4420
03:06:47,510 --> 03:06:49,070
Doki's homelander moment.

4421
03:06:50,630 --> 03:06:51,290
Oh my god.

4422
03:06:51,390 --> 03:06:52,610
There's gonna be a space level.

4423
03:06:54,130 --> 03:06:55,090
What's this level?

4424
03:06:55,410 --> 03:06:56,590
I assume this is like...

4425
03:06:56,590 --> 03:06:58,110
Me being tiny.

4426
03:06:58,710 --> 03:07:00,630
And then there's the haunted house level.

4427
03:07:00,810 --> 03:07:02,010
And there's a tiki level.

4428
03:07:02,730 --> 03:07:03,270
Which one is he?

4429
03:07:03,390 --> 03:07:03,590
Oh.

4430
03:07:03,990 --> 03:07:04,930
Oh, this is the one to go.

4431
03:07:06,010 --> 03:07:07,630
I've always wanted a brother.

4432
03:07:09,030 --> 03:07:10,850
You want to travel to Oztown?

4433
03:07:11,010 --> 03:07:11,450
Yes!

4434
03:07:11,830 --> 03:07:13,150
Take me to Oztown.

4435
03:07:21,320 --> 03:07:22,540
Which one is this?

4436
03:07:24,100 --> 03:07:24,600
Oh!

4437
03:07:26,260 --> 03:07:28,260
Oh my god, I can't believe Super Mario copied it.

4438
03:07:32,480 --> 03:07:33,760
I'm joking, guys.

4439
03:07:35,180 --> 03:07:40,640
Well, no shame in Super Mario for copying it.

4440
03:07:45,660 --> 03:07:46,180
Please.

4441
03:07:58,660 --> 03:08:00,040
Wait, does that hurt me?

4442
03:08:00,300 --> 03:08:01,020
No, it doesn't.

4443
03:08:01,120 --> 03:08:01,720
Oh my god!

4444
03:08:01,840 --> 03:08:02,920
No, he doesn't hurt me, though.

4445
03:08:03,760 --> 03:08:05,240
Oh my god, she's dancing!

4446
03:08:05,940 --> 03:08:06,400
Whoa!

4447
03:08:07,860 --> 03:08:08,340
Whoa!

4448
03:08:08,900 --> 03:08:09,040
Whoa!

4449
03:08:09,040 --> 03:08:09,680
Oh my god, I killed her.

4450
03:08:10,040 --> 03:08:10,160
Oh.

4451
03:08:14,640 --> 03:08:15,440
Oh, shit.

4452
03:08:15,800 --> 03:08:17,320
I don't know this episode.

4453
03:08:18,340 --> 03:08:18,820
Actually.

4454
03:08:20,320 --> 03:08:22,380
This episode's not that familiar to me.

4455
03:08:24,560 --> 03:08:26,000
We all saw...

4456
03:08:26,000 --> 03:08:26,500
No, no, no.

4457
03:08:26,680 --> 03:08:27,300
Nothing happened.

4458
03:08:27,620 --> 03:08:29,160
Nothing happened between me and her.

4459
03:08:31,380 --> 03:08:33,260
I'm bum bum bum bum bum.

4460
03:08:36,660 --> 03:08:38,800
Oh, there's a film over there!

4461
03:08:42,240 --> 03:08:43,940
Oh, there's a film over there!

4462
03:08:43,940 --> 03:08:47,080
Do I get over there?

4463
03:08:47,080 --> 03:08:47,960
Yeah, I can.

4464
03:08:48,320 --> 03:08:48,920
Oh, shit.

4465
03:08:49,040 --> 03:08:49,900
That's why I can tank it hit.

4466
03:08:57,920 --> 03:08:58,320
Wow.

4467
03:08:58,680 --> 03:08:59,980
I don't know what to expect.

4468
03:09:00,120 --> 03:09:00,500
I don't know.

4469
03:09:00,660 --> 03:09:02,920
I thought... I thought it was friendly.

4470
03:09:03,340 --> 03:09:03,980
Wait, what?

4471
03:09:04,300 --> 03:09:05,680
What's the point of going down here?

4472
03:09:07,640 --> 03:09:08,780
There's nothing down here.

4473
03:09:14,630 --> 03:09:15,770
Yeah, I don't remember.

4474
03:09:15,990 --> 03:09:17,270
I don't think I've seen this episode.

4475
03:09:20,630 --> 03:09:22,430
Oh, I didn't get any film.

4476
03:09:23,950 --> 03:09:24,730
Oh, whatever.

4477
03:09:25,590 --> 03:09:26,250
Wait, actually?

4478
03:09:27,450 --> 03:09:30,950
I think it's because I didn't... Oh, I have to go all the way there.

4479
03:09:31,770 --> 03:09:32,490
Friendly fire.

4480
03:09:32,590 --> 03:09:33,910
I thought it was friendly fire!

4481
03:09:38,890 --> 03:09:40,370
Oh, I knew it!

4482
03:09:40,430 --> 03:09:41,050
I knew it!

4483
03:09:42,250 --> 03:09:43,630
I knew I'm so smart.

4484
03:09:44,210 --> 03:09:44,910
Through that mirror.

4485
03:09:46,350 --> 03:09:47,830
Yeah, go back to Oz Town.

4486
03:09:51,210 --> 03:09:52,690
That's like I saw a hole.

4487
03:09:52,990 --> 03:09:55,030
And when there's a hole, there's always a goal.

4488
03:09:56,770 --> 03:09:56,890
Hello!

4489
03:09:58,130 --> 03:09:59,890
Hey, it's so friendly!

4490
03:10:00,770 --> 03:10:02,270
Welcome to Oz Town!

4491
03:10:03,670 --> 03:10:05,010
It doesn't look too bad.

4492
03:10:05,950 --> 03:10:09,570
It looks like Donald's tugboat sank since I was last here.

4493
03:10:10,090 --> 03:10:10,570
Donald?

4494
03:10:12,090 --> 03:10:14,550
I've always liked that Oswald statue.

4495
03:10:15,570 --> 03:10:18,710
That fellow standing from the gag factor is named Moody.

4496
03:10:19,290 --> 03:10:20,430
He's Moody.

4497
03:10:21,890 --> 03:10:22,610
Donald?

4498
03:10:23,090 --> 03:10:24,030
Donald's here?

4499
03:10:24,310 --> 03:10:25,570
Donald, what are you doing here?

4500
03:10:25,630 --> 03:10:26,690
Everybody loves you!

4501
03:10:33,390 --> 03:10:34,110
Clarabelle?

4502
03:10:34,910 --> 03:10:35,290
No!

4503
03:10:36,190 --> 03:10:38,410
Land 6 Mickey Mouse?

4504
03:10:38,870 --> 03:10:40,190
It's Clarabelle!

4505
03:10:40,370 --> 03:10:42,190
Why, you must remember me!

4506
03:10:42,750 --> 03:10:45,570
Yeah, Clarabelle isn't a forgotten character.

4507
03:10:46,190 --> 03:10:47,390
Look, look, look!

4508
03:10:47,790 --> 03:10:50,550
I was in Mickey's melodramar.

4509
03:10:50,930 --> 03:10:52,890
And Mickey's polo team.

4510
03:10:52,910 --> 03:10:54,370
I dined with the stars.

4511
03:10:54,930 --> 03:10:57,390
Orphan's benefit both the original and...

4512
03:10:58,010 --> 03:10:59,330
Yeah, she's not forgotten.

4513
03:10:59,330 --> 03:10:59,930
She's...

4514
03:10:59,930 --> 03:11:01,510
She's Goofy's girlfriend!

4515
03:11:02,630 --> 03:11:04,750
Before, like, they gave him away.

4516
03:11:05,330 --> 03:11:07,370
I'll just get back to my garden.

4517
03:11:07,910 --> 03:11:09,230
With all the commotion.

4518
03:11:09,490 --> 03:11:11,430
It's the only thing that makes me happy.

4519
03:11:14,090 --> 03:11:14,610
Yeah.

4520
03:11:16,770 --> 03:11:18,570
She was in House and Mouse, too.

4521
03:11:19,430 --> 03:11:20,990
So you're going after Oswald, are you?

4522
03:11:21,150 --> 03:11:22,550
That sounds dangerous.

4523
03:11:24,330 --> 03:11:25,270
No, she...

4524
03:11:25,270 --> 03:11:28,390
At one point, they made her Goofy's girlfriend, too.

4525
03:11:29,890 --> 03:11:31,150
And then, like...

4526
03:11:31,150 --> 03:11:31,730
Like...

4527
03:11:31,730 --> 03:11:33,830
Like, she would, like, chase after Goofy and stuff.

4528
03:11:33,950 --> 03:11:36,150
And then they retconned that and gave Goofy a dead wife.

4529
03:11:36,790 --> 03:11:37,690
So you're going after Oswald?

4530
03:11:38,070 --> 03:11:38,770
That sounds dangerous.

4531
03:11:39,110 --> 03:11:42,690
If you're going to Mickey Junk Mountain, you'll need to fix that bridge.

4532
03:11:45,530 --> 03:11:48,410
There was a gremlin happening around here.

4533
03:11:48,650 --> 03:11:50,310
But it's been missing a while.

4534
03:11:53,590 --> 03:11:58,110
Oh, but before I forget, something has been making noise over near the gag factory.

4535
03:12:01,970 --> 03:12:03,310
Can you go see what it is?

4536
03:12:03,430 --> 03:12:05,250
It sounds like something might be calling for help.

4537
03:12:05,650 --> 03:12:07,030
I'll go check it out myself.

4538
03:12:07,370 --> 03:12:08,090
But, well...

4539
03:12:08,090 --> 03:12:08,410
You know.

4540
03:12:09,350 --> 03:12:10,210
You know what?

4541
03:12:14,780 --> 03:12:15,620
Don't do it.

4542
03:12:21,400 --> 03:12:22,840
I didn't do it.

4543
03:12:23,740 --> 03:12:24,840
I did it.

4544
03:12:25,420 --> 03:12:27,020
I didn't do it.

4545
03:12:27,420 --> 03:12:28,800
I got it.

4546
03:12:29,660 --> 03:12:31,360
I didn't do it.

4547
03:12:34,980 --> 03:12:35,860
Wait...

4548
03:12:35,860 --> 03:12:36,580
Goofy?

4549
03:12:40,560 --> 03:12:41,460
That's Goofy.

4550
03:12:41,700 --> 03:12:42,440
I mean...

4551
03:12:42,440 --> 03:12:42,920
Sort of.

4552
03:12:43,980 --> 03:12:45,200
It's an animatronic, Goofy.

4553
03:12:45,620 --> 03:12:47,880
Oswald built him with the mad doctor's help.

4554
03:12:49,560 --> 03:12:51,180
Oswald wanted a friend like your pal.

4555
03:12:51,340 --> 03:12:51,740
Gosh.

4556
03:12:51,860 --> 03:12:52,520
Hello, Mickey.

4557
03:12:53,200 --> 03:12:54,460
Where's the rest of him?

4558
03:12:54,960 --> 03:12:56,360
What happened to you, Goofy?

4559
03:12:56,980 --> 03:12:57,720
Oh, gosh.

4560
03:12:58,080 --> 03:13:00,320
Well, I was doing some work in Tomorrow City.

4561
03:13:01,380 --> 03:13:05,300
And the mad doctor went at some of his own friends tear me in pieces.

4562
03:13:07,520 --> 03:13:10,220
And now my parts are scattered all over.

4563
03:13:10,800 --> 03:13:13,120
No account you had to put me together again, Mickey.

4564
03:13:14,460 --> 03:13:15,500
Oh, gosh.

4565
03:13:16,400 --> 03:13:17,060
Hey, Mickey.

4566
03:13:17,300 --> 03:13:18,380
Do you think you could help me up?

4567
03:13:18,820 --> 03:13:22,560
The mad doctor scattered all my body parts around Tomorrow City.

4568
03:13:23,120 --> 03:13:26,220
If you were going by there, could you get them put me back together?

4569
03:13:26,640 --> 03:13:27,140
Okay.

4570
03:13:28,700 --> 03:13:30,640
My Five Nights at Freddy's.

4571
03:13:40,220 --> 03:13:41,140
So close.

4572
03:13:44,300 --> 03:13:45,800
It's right there.

4573
03:13:46,000 --> 03:13:46,440
Oh, shit.

4574
03:13:47,620 --> 03:13:49,180
It's right there.

4575
03:13:51,760 --> 03:13:54,120
I wonder if I paint their house back.

4576
03:13:54,200 --> 03:13:56,480
Will I be able to go into their house?

4577
03:14:00,500 --> 03:14:01,580
Don't keep food.

4578
03:14:03,320 --> 03:14:03,960
Oh, wait.

4579
03:14:04,240 --> 03:14:06,100
Oz one copied my house?

4580
03:14:07,960 --> 03:14:09,320
That's fucking creepy, buddy.

4581
03:14:10,520 --> 03:14:12,120
Amelia, at your service, Mickey.

4582
03:14:12,360 --> 03:14:13,540
Welcome to Oz's house.

4583
03:14:13,760 --> 03:14:16,120
Your house here is, you know...

4584
03:14:16,120 --> 03:14:17,940
And I saw something bright and glowing in the room.

4585
03:14:18,080 --> 03:14:19,120
I hope it's not trouble.

4586
03:14:19,920 --> 03:14:21,200
That's fucking creepy, bro.

4587
03:14:22,360 --> 03:14:22,880
Make your...

4588
03:14:22,880 --> 03:14:24,340
Bro, make your own house.

4589
03:14:25,940 --> 03:14:26,380
Hello?

4590
03:14:26,600 --> 03:14:27,020
Mickey Mouse?

4591
03:14:27,020 --> 03:14:28,920
Welcome to the Wasteland Bridge of your house.

4592
03:14:32,100 --> 03:14:33,200
That's so creepy.

4593
03:14:33,360 --> 03:14:34,920
Bro, like, he's not even creative.

4594
03:14:36,500 --> 03:14:37,060
Bro.

4595
03:14:38,120 --> 03:14:41,720
Not even fucking creative enough to make his own house.

4596
03:14:42,660 --> 03:14:44,200
There's, like, something shiny?

4597
03:14:45,060 --> 03:14:46,080
What does he mean?

4598
03:14:46,620 --> 03:14:47,160
This?

4599
03:14:48,780 --> 03:14:52,320
He said there was something shiny on my roof, but I don't see it.

4600
03:14:54,700 --> 03:14:55,300
What?

4601
03:14:55,300 --> 03:14:55,820
Where was it?

4602
03:14:57,080 --> 03:14:57,380
What?

4603
03:14:59,360 --> 03:15:01,580
He was like, there's something shiny here.

4604
03:15:05,080 --> 03:15:06,220
I'm, like, so confused.

4605
03:15:09,320 --> 03:15:10,780
Let's paint this house back.

4606
03:15:11,160 --> 03:15:11,920
Oh, shit!

4607
03:15:16,520 --> 03:15:18,100
Not fully painted back.

4608
03:15:25,490 --> 03:15:26,070
Wait, what?

4609
03:15:26,650 --> 03:15:27,650
It's fully painted.

4610
03:15:28,030 --> 03:15:28,790
Oh, never mind.

4611
03:15:30,410 --> 03:15:31,750
Can I go in now?

4612
03:15:34,350 --> 03:15:35,310
Stupid house.

4613
03:15:37,050 --> 03:15:37,910
Oh, shit.

4614
03:15:38,070 --> 03:15:39,150
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

4615
03:15:40,010 --> 03:15:40,610
Okay.

4616
03:15:40,610 --> 03:15:40,690
What is it?

4617
03:15:41,750 --> 03:15:42,880
I'm double-checking?

4618
03:15:45,870 --> 03:15:48,110
Yeah, I fully fucking fixed this house.

4619
03:15:49,910 --> 03:15:52,210
It's like, doing a half...

4620
03:15:52,210 --> 03:15:52,910
What do you mean?

4621
03:15:54,610 --> 03:15:55,730
They said...

4622
03:15:56,470 --> 03:15:58,970
She said there was something shiny on the roof.

4623
03:15:59,250 --> 03:15:59,870
Where is it?

4624
03:16:01,530 --> 03:16:03,070
I don't see no shine.

4625
03:16:03,070 --> 03:16:03,270
What?

4626
03:16:05,110 --> 03:16:06,390
The corners.

4627
03:16:06,670 --> 03:16:07,210
What am I doing?

4628
03:16:07,350 --> 03:16:08,990
Power flush simulating?

4629
03:16:12,090 --> 03:16:13,950
I did the corners!

4630
03:16:17,930 --> 03:16:19,930
Get out the roofs.

4631
03:16:22,930 --> 03:16:23,750
Oh, my God.

4632
03:16:23,950 --> 03:16:25,010
This house is fixed.

4633
03:16:25,750 --> 03:16:27,610
I fixed everything!

4634
03:16:29,830 --> 03:16:30,610
I give up.

4635
03:16:32,350 --> 03:16:33,450
I give up.

4636
03:16:33,770 --> 03:16:35,510
You keep this stupid ass house.

4637
03:16:41,350 --> 03:16:42,410
How do I...

4638
03:16:42,410 --> 03:16:43,970
I can't jump on that roof.

4639
03:16:46,010 --> 03:16:47,410
It won't let me.

4640
03:16:50,940 --> 03:16:51,870
Oh, see?

4641
03:16:53,250 --> 03:16:55,230
I can't get on top of it.

4642
03:16:58,170 --> 03:16:59,610
Oh, this one?

4643
03:17:01,550 --> 03:17:03,390
What the fuck do I fix this house?

4644
03:17:06,910 --> 03:17:07,510
Oh!

4645
03:17:08,210 --> 03:17:08,810
Oh!

4646
03:17:10,170 --> 03:17:11,250
I knew that.

4647
03:17:12,830 --> 03:17:14,210
I knew that, guys.

4648
03:17:15,850 --> 03:17:16,450
Wait.

4649
03:17:16,690 --> 03:17:17,390
No, what?

4650
03:17:18,270 --> 03:17:19,650
That doesn't make sense.

4651
03:17:23,690 --> 03:17:24,910
Doesn't make sense.

4652
03:17:27,130 --> 03:17:27,790
That's it.

4653
03:17:27,850 --> 03:17:28,830
I'm destroying this house.

4654
03:17:31,370 --> 03:17:32,270
That's fucking it.

4655
03:17:32,270 --> 03:17:32,810
I'm angry.

4656
03:17:35,150 --> 03:17:35,890
That's it.

4657
03:17:38,810 --> 03:17:39,410
That's it.

4658
03:17:39,570 --> 03:17:40,550
Fuck your house, Oswald!

4659
03:17:43,350 --> 03:17:44,090
That's right!

4660
03:17:45,630 --> 03:17:47,330
Try to copy my house!

4661
03:17:47,910 --> 03:17:49,050
That's fucking right!

4662
03:17:50,010 --> 03:17:50,950
Fuck your house!

4663
03:17:50,950 --> 03:17:51,290
Oh, wait.

4664
03:17:51,410 --> 03:17:52,030
There it is.

4665
03:17:52,210 --> 03:17:52,610
Oh, nice.

4666
03:17:53,130 --> 03:17:53,630
Alright.

4667
03:17:54,550 --> 03:17:55,050
Evil!

4668
03:17:58,490 --> 03:17:59,110
That's right.

4669
03:17:59,210 --> 03:18:00,730
You don't... you don't steal my house!

4670
03:18:02,070 --> 03:18:02,570
I'll...

4671
03:18:02,570 --> 03:18:04,610
Erase your house, Oswald.

4672
03:18:05,350 --> 03:18:06,990
That's goddamn right!

4673
03:18:09,790 --> 03:18:11,390
I'll brace everything you love!

4674
03:18:13,050 --> 03:18:15,610
The work of a villain, I see.

4675
03:18:20,310 --> 03:18:20,790
Sayonara!

4676
03:18:22,890 --> 03:18:26,890
Folks keep trying to visit the Gag Factory, only to find out it's been out of...

4677
03:18:26,890 --> 03:18:28,270
And I get rewarded!

4678
03:18:31,650 --> 03:18:33,530
It's the bright colors that fool them.

4679
03:18:33,810 --> 03:18:36,370
Send out as much of it as you can, and I'll make it worth your while.

4680
03:18:37,570 --> 03:18:38,330
Wait, what?

4681
03:18:39,050 --> 03:18:41,310
He wants me to send out...

4682
03:18:41,310 --> 03:18:45,230
When I show up, you show up, and also, I knew I mean good things.

4683
03:18:45,790 --> 03:18:46,790
Do you even know...

4684
03:18:46,790 --> 03:18:48,450
That you repaired my house for me?

4685
03:18:48,830 --> 03:18:51,470
Now I don't have to hang out in the safe for shelter all day.

4686
03:18:51,810 --> 03:18:53,970
Speaking of the safe, you wanna know the combination?

4687
03:18:54,770 --> 03:18:56,530
Something in there complains all the time.

4688
03:18:56,710 --> 03:18:57,910
I'm kinda tired of it.

4689
03:18:58,150 --> 03:18:59,250
Here's the combination.

4690
03:18:59,630 --> 03:19:01,250
Wait, how do I fucking get that?

4691
03:19:05,710 --> 03:19:06,110
Okay.

4692
03:19:12,270 --> 03:19:13,110
Oh.

4693
03:19:17,780 --> 03:19:18,920
Go to your house.

4694
03:19:20,240 --> 03:19:22,060
Go to your fucking house.

4695
03:19:23,880 --> 03:19:25,340
Why aren't you...

4696
03:19:28,220 --> 03:19:29,720
Go to your house!

4697
03:19:29,800 --> 03:19:31,140
I fixed your house!

4698
03:19:35,980 --> 03:19:36,400
Don't...

4699
03:19:36,740 --> 03:19:37,960
Don't do it!

4700
03:19:38,120 --> 03:19:39,260
But I fixed it!

4701
03:19:41,860 --> 03:19:42,700
Oh...

4702
03:19:45,200 --> 03:19:47,060
I almost killed him!

4703
03:19:53,960 --> 03:19:55,020
Oh, I did it.

4704
03:19:55,440 --> 03:19:56,260
I'm a hero.

4705
03:19:59,860 --> 03:20:01,960
I was about to risk it all.

4706
03:20:06,160 --> 03:20:07,780
What a good likeness.

4707
03:20:09,080 --> 03:20:10,520
Thank you for rescuing me.

4708
03:20:10,760 --> 03:20:11,880
I owe you one.

4709
03:20:12,360 --> 03:20:13,740
Head to the Mickey Chunk Mountain?

4710
03:20:13,960 --> 03:20:14,640
I can help.

4711
03:20:14,860 --> 03:20:16,080
Boy, I need my wrench.

4712
03:20:17,440 --> 03:20:20,860
When I tinkered that telephone in your house, it tricked me into the safe.

4713
03:20:21,460 --> 03:20:22,700
I'm sure he has my wrench.

4714
03:20:22,900 --> 03:20:25,160
So you don't need to go and get it back from him.

4715
03:20:25,580 --> 03:20:26,940
Let me know when you have it.

4716
03:20:29,600 --> 03:20:31,140
Why does he want me to...

4717
03:20:32,420 --> 03:20:34,320
Why does he want me to...

4718
03:20:34,320 --> 03:20:36,120
Should I actually thin it out?

4719
03:20:36,320 --> 03:20:37,000
I don't know.

4720
03:20:37,000 --> 03:20:37,040
I don't know.

4721
03:20:40,020 --> 03:20:40,900
Oh, he moved.

4722
03:20:41,040 --> 03:20:41,440
See guys?

4723
03:20:41,620 --> 03:20:42,020
He moved.

4724
03:20:47,620 --> 03:20:48,020
Alright.

4725
03:20:48,320 --> 03:20:49,140
It's not my house.

4726
03:20:49,280 --> 03:20:49,920
It's Oswald.

4727
03:20:50,300 --> 03:20:51,720
Okay, copying my shit.

4728
03:20:54,260 --> 03:20:56,460
P. Scott wants his wrench back?

4729
03:20:56,700 --> 03:20:57,340
No way!

4730
03:20:57,940 --> 03:21:00,480
Look, if he gets his wrench back, he's going to disassemble me.

4731
03:21:00,720 --> 03:21:01,080
Dissemble!

4732
03:21:01,580 --> 03:21:03,540
He's so mad that I'm locked up in that safe.

4733
03:21:03,960 --> 03:21:04,580
Really, though.

4734
03:21:04,800 --> 03:21:05,660
He had it coming.

4735
03:21:06,340 --> 03:21:08,960
Anyway, I'll tell you you need the wrench, so I'll tell you what...

4736
03:21:08,960 --> 03:21:10,500
I can tell you you need the wrench, so I'll tell you what you need.

4737
03:21:10,500 --> 03:21:14,140
If you help me restore my signal to the Main Street, I'll give you the wrench.

4738
03:21:14,940 --> 03:21:17,680
There are three more power boxes like this one around Oswald's town.

4739
03:21:18,240 --> 03:21:20,620
Enabling them will allow me to reach people in Main Street.

4740
03:21:20,940 --> 03:21:21,380
Okay.

4741
03:21:21,960 --> 03:21:22,660
That's fine.

4742
03:21:25,460 --> 03:21:26,960
He's not even a gremlin.

4743
03:21:27,280 --> 03:21:31,000
I respect that it's your house, but you let me get in there, I'll get my wrench back.

4744
03:21:31,360 --> 03:21:33,100
Can I go in and get my wrench?

4745
03:21:33,260 --> 03:21:33,740
Okay, no.

4746
03:21:38,230 --> 03:21:38,970
Okay, no.

4747
03:21:39,130 --> 03:21:39,950
Calm down.

4748
03:21:40,290 --> 03:21:41,190
Calm down.

4749
03:21:41,310 --> 03:21:42,330
I'll fix it.

4750
03:21:45,410 --> 03:21:46,890
I can fix it.

4751
03:21:48,750 --> 03:21:50,850
Okay, where the fuck is the power thing?

4752
03:21:52,910 --> 03:21:53,430
Wait.

4753
03:21:55,310 --> 03:21:56,750
Where the fuck is it?

4754
03:21:57,130 --> 03:21:58,730
He said there's three around here.

4755
03:22:02,260 --> 03:22:05,180
I know you wanna beat him up, but we can fix this.

4756
03:22:07,180 --> 03:22:07,700
What?

4757
03:22:12,040 --> 03:22:13,840
We don't need to fix the house.

4758
03:22:14,200 --> 03:22:16,080
This is already activated, see?

4759
03:22:17,900 --> 03:22:20,020
He said there's three more here.

4760
03:22:20,960 --> 03:22:22,480
I don't see it.

4761
03:22:23,740 --> 03:22:26,020
Where the fuck is the three other powers?

4762
03:22:37,950 --> 03:22:39,630
He doesn't deserve this.

4763
03:22:41,110 --> 03:22:41,750
He doesn't deserve this.

4764
03:22:41,750 --> 03:22:42,930
Also does not deserve it.

4765
03:22:43,030 --> 03:22:43,670
You know it.

4766
03:22:47,620 --> 03:22:50,800
He's gonna be really fixed.

4767
03:22:50,800 --> 03:22:51,220
Fix.

4768
03:22:52,940 --> 03:22:55,080
Okay, that should be fully fixed, right?

4769
03:22:56,300 --> 03:22:56,960
There we go.

4770
03:22:57,080 --> 03:22:59,500
They're happy I fixed the stupid house.

4771
03:23:00,380 --> 03:23:01,440
Goddamn copycat.

4772
03:23:01,440 --> 03:23:01,880
Copycat.

4773
03:23:06,110 --> 03:23:07,250
Oh my god.

4774
03:23:07,510 --> 03:23:08,770
There was no point in fixing it.

4775
03:23:08,870 --> 03:23:09,510
There was no point.

4776
03:23:10,170 --> 03:23:11,770
There was no point in fixing it.

4777
03:23:14,450 --> 03:23:15,650
Where is it?

4778
03:23:19,900 --> 03:23:24,140
Okay, I feel like I can hear... the thing too.

4779
03:23:25,540 --> 03:23:28,580
Oh my god, what the fu... Okay, that was random.

4780
03:23:30,960 --> 03:23:34,520
I literally did not think that was... I... Oh.

4781
03:23:35,620 --> 03:23:36,460
I'm a genius.

4782
03:23:40,580 --> 03:23:41,860
Where is it?

4783
03:23:43,540 --> 03:23:47,120
Okay, maybe... I'll... get rid of the color here.

4784
03:23:48,620 --> 03:23:52,760
He said that... he doesn't like that the gag shot...

4785
03:23:56,720 --> 03:23:57,660
had color.

4786
03:23:59,140 --> 03:24:00,560
Oh hey, what's this?

4787
03:24:03,100 --> 03:24:03,660
Alright.

4788
03:24:06,060 --> 03:24:06,960
Uh, hold on.

4789
03:24:07,020 --> 03:24:07,880
Thank you for the super chat.

4790
03:24:08,040 --> 03:24:08,240
Thank you.

4791
03:24:08,420 --> 03:24:08,720
Thank you.

4792
03:24:08,720 --> 03:24:09,760
Wait, where is the guy?

4793
03:24:10,000 --> 03:24:12,320
What the fu... I... ruined your gag factory!

4794
03:24:12,480 --> 03:24:13,020
Oh, there he is.

4795
03:24:15,580 --> 03:24:16,500
Oh my god.

4796
03:24:16,900 --> 03:24:18,500
How much more do you want me to thin out?

4797
03:24:19,660 --> 03:24:20,380
What's this?

4798
03:24:24,320 --> 03:24:25,140
Thin enough?

4799
03:24:26,600 --> 03:24:28,940
Yeah, I'm doing Power Wash Simulator.

4800
03:24:29,380 --> 03:24:29,560
Yeah.

4801
03:24:34,750 --> 03:24:37,310
It's just Power Wash Simulator with extra steps.

4802
03:24:42,790 --> 03:24:44,910
Yeah, let's have... oh my god, it's over here.

4803
03:24:45,650 --> 03:24:46,630
OH MY GOD!

4804
03:24:46,930 --> 03:24:47,750
Okay, there's one.

4805
03:24:48,210 --> 03:24:48,930
Two more to go.

4806
03:24:51,970 --> 03:24:53,670
Let's get rid of this real fast.

4807
03:24:53,810 --> 03:24:54,150
Oh nice!

4808
03:24:54,330 --> 03:24:54,930
A power spark!

4809
03:24:55,930 --> 03:24:57,030
That's actually what we needed.

4810
03:24:59,150 --> 03:25:00,750
Okay, is that enough for it?

4811
03:25:01,150 --> 03:25:02,230
Who wanted this here?

4812
03:25:03,950 --> 03:25:07,870
Now that place won't have much... so much attention now.

4813
03:25:08,290 --> 03:25:09,130
Have a power spark.

4814
03:25:09,650 --> 03:25:09,970
Also...

4815
03:25:09,970 --> 03:25:11,110
Oh Ducky, good to see you good.

4816
03:25:11,270 --> 03:25:12,350
I love all the things you've been doing.

4817
03:25:12,870 --> 03:25:13,690
Keep at it like that.

4818
03:25:13,830 --> 03:25:15,090
And wish you the best of the past.

4819
03:25:15,350 --> 03:25:15,850
Thank you!

4820
03:25:15,910 --> 03:25:16,730
Thank you super chat.

4821
03:25:16,830 --> 03:25:17,570
Thank you, thank you.

4822
03:25:17,710 --> 03:25:18,450
Okay, we got two.

4823
03:25:18,990 --> 03:25:20,150
Oh, we got... we need two more.

4824
03:25:20,990 --> 03:25:22,430
What the fu... is the other two?

4825
03:25:26,310 --> 03:25:27,430
I feel it!

4826
03:25:29,470 --> 03:25:30,690
Oh hey, nice.

4827
03:25:31,510 --> 03:25:31,990
What?

4828
03:25:33,310 --> 03:25:33,790
Oh!

4829
03:25:35,830 --> 03:25:36,750
One more to go...

4830
03:25:36,750 --> 03:25:39,110
Oh my god, they're like hidden like that?

4831
03:25:40,690 --> 03:25:43,390
Oh my god, I should have just let him beat up the telephone.

4832
03:25:43,690 --> 03:25:44,130
I...

4833
03:25:45,390 --> 03:25:46,350
God fucking...

4834
03:25:46,350 --> 03:25:47,750
I should have just let him beat up the telephone.

4835
03:25:47,990 --> 03:25:48,890
He deserves it.

4836
03:25:49,730 --> 03:25:51,010
This is too much work.

4837
03:25:59,150 --> 03:26:01,010
Where's the last one though?

4838
03:26:04,010 --> 03:26:04,830
That's the thing.

4839
03:26:06,450 --> 03:26:08,290
Where is the last one?

4840
03:26:14,610 --> 03:26:16,630
I'm trying to find it.

4841
03:26:19,710 --> 03:26:22,210
Cause that's the one where I found earlier.

4842
03:26:22,430 --> 03:26:23,510
Like behind that wall?

4843
03:26:24,070 --> 03:26:26,130
Where the fuck is the last one?

4844
03:26:33,010 --> 03:26:33,370
Huh.

4845
03:26:36,270 --> 03:26:37,270
I don't see it.

4846
03:26:38,010 --> 03:26:38,810
The floor?

4847
03:26:40,490 --> 03:26:41,950
Is it near the floor?

4848
03:26:48,910 --> 03:26:49,810
Not here.

4849
03:26:55,900 --> 03:26:58,340
I swear to god, if I don't find it...

4850
03:26:58,340 --> 03:26:59,780
This guy's gotta beat up a telephone.

4851
03:27:00,380 --> 03:27:00,980
I swear...

4852
03:27:05,220 --> 03:27:07,280
If I don't find it...

4853
03:27:07,280 --> 03:27:09,760
I'm letting him in there.

4854
03:27:09,940 --> 03:27:11,060
Letting him fucking...

4855
03:27:11,060 --> 03:27:12,860
Beat up that fucking telephone.

4856
03:27:15,840 --> 03:27:17,520
Almost said it's like in the grass.

4857
03:27:18,220 --> 03:27:19,280
I'm mad.

4858
03:27:23,850 --> 03:27:25,890
It's just a power pop.

4859
03:27:26,250 --> 03:27:28,950
The things I do for less violence.

4860
03:27:34,320 --> 03:27:36,020
Where the fuck am I...

4861
03:27:36,020 --> 03:27:36,640
Okay guys.

4862
03:27:37,560 --> 03:27:38,100
Guys.

4863
03:27:39,500 --> 03:27:40,620
I need help.

4864
03:27:40,760 --> 03:27:41,180
SOS.

4865
03:27:44,300 --> 03:27:45,500
Where is it?

4866
03:27:50,070 --> 03:27:51,250
On the grass?

4867
03:27:55,320 --> 03:27:55,840
Okay.

4868
03:27:56,480 --> 03:27:58,060
I'll ruin her stupid...

4869
03:27:58,060 --> 03:27:58,300
Oh!

4870
03:27:58,680 --> 03:27:59,560
What the fuck?

4871
03:28:01,280 --> 03:28:02,820
Oh my god.

4872
03:28:03,040 --> 03:28:06,740
No wonder people would just let him beat up the fucking stupid ass.

4873
03:28:08,560 --> 03:28:09,920
That is actually...

4874
03:28:09,920 --> 03:28:10,460
Oh my god.

4875
03:28:10,620 --> 03:28:11,100
That is...

4876
03:28:11,100 --> 03:28:12,580
How was I supposed to figure that out?

4877
03:28:12,960 --> 03:28:13,360
How...

4878
03:28:13,360 --> 03:28:14,520
Who the fuck lived here?

4879
03:28:14,960 --> 03:28:16,000
Who lived here?

4880
03:28:16,280 --> 03:28:18,120
There's like a secret hidden bunker.

4881
03:28:18,440 --> 03:28:19,900
Someone actually slept here.

4882
03:28:22,880 --> 03:28:23,240
Yeah.

4883
03:28:23,400 --> 03:28:24,820
This is like the harder version.

4884
03:28:26,060 --> 03:28:27,180
I could have just looked away.

4885
03:28:27,800 --> 03:28:28,900
I could have let him in that house.

4886
03:28:29,000 --> 03:28:29,500
Looked away.

4887
03:28:33,780 --> 03:28:34,980
Power boxes are restored.

4888
03:28:34,980 --> 03:28:37,040
I could not reach even further than Mean Street.

4889
03:28:37,560 --> 03:28:38,840
That should keep me busy for a while.

4890
03:28:39,120 --> 03:28:39,440
Thanks.

4891
03:28:39,740 --> 03:28:40,980
Here's the wrench I promised.

4892
03:28:44,280 --> 03:28:45,500
Can you do one more thing with me?

4893
03:28:45,700 --> 03:28:46,900
I'm trying to reach a phone out.

4894
03:28:47,620 --> 03:28:48,880
In Mickey Junk Mountain.

4895
03:28:49,380 --> 03:28:51,300
You dial 76 on one of the phones out here?

4896
03:28:51,500 --> 03:28:53,020
It should help me find a connection again.

4897
03:28:53,540 --> 03:28:55,120
I will work for you when you get back.

4898
03:28:56,020 --> 03:28:56,340
Okay.

4899
03:29:04,440 --> 03:29:05,040
Alright.

4900
03:29:05,920 --> 03:29:07,640
Use your stupid ass wrench.

4901
03:29:11,190 --> 03:29:14,030
Now I have a wrench so I can fix this bridge.

4902
03:29:14,650 --> 03:29:15,130
Alright.

4903
03:29:15,470 --> 03:29:16,370
Here you go.

4904
03:29:21,070 --> 03:29:22,110
Okay, let him go.

4905
03:29:22,530 --> 03:29:23,510
He's doing it.

4906
03:29:25,550 --> 03:29:25,950
Yeah!

4907
03:29:29,190 --> 03:29:31,350
Good luck on Mickey Junk Mountain, Mickey.

4908
03:29:31,730 --> 03:29:32,570
Okay, let's go.

4909
03:29:33,310 --> 03:29:34,470
I fucking did it.

4910
03:29:34,630 --> 03:29:35,910
I didn't destroy too much.

4911
03:29:38,650 --> 03:29:39,570
Alright.

4912
03:29:39,970 --> 03:29:41,330
Mickey Steamroller.

4913
03:29:41,890 --> 03:29:43,110
Guess I'm ready.

4914
03:29:44,370 --> 03:29:45,270
Blue Skat Bee.

4915
03:29:46,130 --> 03:29:47,050
Go!

4916
03:29:50,350 --> 03:29:52,590
Who'sognет tinting, so can you!

4917
03:30:07,250 --> 03:30:08,010
Yay!

4918
03:30:08,670 --> 03:30:09,110
Murder!

4919
03:30:13,970 --> 03:30:14,990
Let's go!

4920
03:30:15,930 --> 03:30:18,070
Technically, it's not me committing the murder.

4921
03:30:18,590 --> 03:30:19,930
It's this train.

4922
03:30:20,590 --> 03:30:22,030
It's not my fault.

4923
03:30:24,070 --> 03:30:24,830
Yay!

4924
03:30:25,390 --> 03:30:26,410
Property damage!

4925
03:30:26,790 --> 03:30:27,270
Let's go!

4926
03:30:27,670 --> 03:30:28,470
Fuck this city!

4927
03:30:29,470 --> 03:30:30,870
We built this city.

4928
03:30:31,830 --> 03:30:33,430
We built this city.

4929
03:30:33,450 --> 03:30:34,010
Oh my god.

4930
03:30:37,350 --> 03:30:37,970
That way.

4931
03:30:39,670 --> 03:30:40,470
Oh hey, money.

4932
03:30:41,910 --> 03:30:42,590
Oh fuck!

4933
03:30:42,770 --> 03:30:43,550
Okay, that scared me actually.

4934
03:30:45,750 --> 03:30:47,230
I can grab the money from here.

4935
03:30:48,250 --> 03:30:48,630
Yay!

4936
03:30:53,110 --> 03:30:53,530
Wait.

4937
03:30:55,910 --> 03:30:57,410
Okay, we don't need that one dollar.

4938
03:30:57,690 --> 03:30:58,690
That's like one dollar.

4939
03:30:58,870 --> 03:30:59,890
Oh my god!

4940
03:31:00,150 --> 03:31:01,730
Okay, I did not expect that to happen.

4941
03:31:03,550 --> 03:31:04,350
Oh no.

4942
03:31:04,710 --> 03:31:05,490
Okay guys, that's fine.

4943
03:31:05,630 --> 03:31:06,730
That's like two dollars.

4944
03:31:07,070 --> 03:31:07,790
We don't need that.

4945
03:31:08,610 --> 03:31:10,210
Oh wait, I can just double jump that.

4946
03:31:10,290 --> 03:31:10,730
What the fuck?

4947
03:31:11,130 --> 03:31:13,010
I absolutely did not need that.

4948
03:31:13,930 --> 03:31:14,670
Oh my god.

4949
03:31:16,770 --> 03:31:18,130
Oh wait, are you serious?

4950
03:31:18,310 --> 03:31:18,490
No.

4951
03:31:19,770 --> 03:31:20,830
No, you fucker.

4952
03:31:21,070 --> 03:31:21,490
No!

4953
03:31:21,750 --> 03:31:23,670
How was I supposed to know there was a film there?

4954
03:31:23,810 --> 03:31:25,170
Until I actually there?

4955
03:31:25,410 --> 03:31:26,210
How was I...

4956
03:31:30,170 --> 03:31:32,530
Oh, I guess we're never doing that...

4957
03:31:32,530 --> 03:31:33,210
Wait, unless...

4958
03:31:36,470 --> 03:31:37,430
I knew it!

4959
03:31:37,730 --> 03:31:38,590
I fucking knew it!

4960
03:31:39,570 --> 03:31:41,090
There's always a secret there.

4961
03:31:43,130 --> 03:31:45,290
Alright, go back to Mickey Junk Mountain.

4962
03:31:49,770 --> 03:31:51,250
Oh my god, look at all the junk.

4963
03:31:51,750 --> 03:31:52,150
There.

4964
03:31:52,290 --> 03:31:54,370
I like the little illustrations in the loading screen.

4965
03:31:54,670 --> 03:31:55,370
It's really cute.

4966
03:31:56,810 --> 03:31:58,290
There's the... What the fuck?

4967
03:31:58,410 --> 03:32:00,090
There's a mountain we have to... Is this capitalism?

4968
03:32:00,910 --> 03:32:02,370
There's a mountain we have to climb.

4969
03:32:02,550 --> 03:32:04,650
Also it's century us all the way up to the top.

4970
03:32:04,830 --> 03:32:06,090
It won't be easy to reach him.

4971
03:32:06,410 --> 03:32:08,630
You see... You see he doesn't really want visitors.

4972
03:32:09,410 --> 03:32:10,670
Oh, funny children.

4973
03:32:11,170 --> 03:32:11,610
Wonderful.

4974
03:32:12,070 --> 03:32:13,210
Wait, he has children?

4975
03:32:14,430 --> 03:32:16,090
Funny children but they look cute.

4976
03:32:16,330 --> 03:32:17,970
But don't get too many around you.

4977
03:32:18,150 --> 03:32:20,770
Or they become significantly less cute.

4978
03:32:21,090 --> 03:32:24,210
And when they see a spatter, they get incredibly uncute.

4979
03:32:24,990 --> 03:32:27,130
From the spatter's perspective anyway.

4980
03:32:28,170 --> 03:32:31,550
I vaguely recall that old crane being powered by some sort of electrical system.

4981
03:32:32,590 --> 03:32:34,290
It appears to be an operator on duty.

4982
03:32:34,550 --> 03:32:36,310
We could ask him for more information.

4983
03:32:37,570 --> 03:32:39,090
Okay, Sika, Oswald.

4984
03:32:39,310 --> 03:32:40,750
Oh, Huey, Dewey, and Louie!

4985
03:32:44,980 --> 03:32:45,540
Alright.

4986
03:32:47,640 --> 03:32:48,760
Let's go...

4987
03:32:48,760 --> 03:32:50,160
This way.

4988
03:32:55,380 --> 03:32:57,460
Oh my god, why aren't your cameras here?

4989
03:32:57,460 --> 03:33:00,300
Oh my god, who's fucking watching me right now?

4990
03:33:04,500 --> 03:33:05,960
Alright, let's go this way.

4991
03:33:07,240 --> 03:33:07,780
Friend?

4992
03:33:10,700 --> 03:33:11,240
Friend?

4993
03:33:12,060 --> 03:33:12,600
Friend.

4994
03:33:13,380 --> 03:33:13,920
Friend.

4995
03:33:14,300 --> 03:33:14,620
Wait.

4996
03:33:15,080 --> 03:33:15,740
Oh my god, wait.

4997
03:33:15,860 --> 03:33:17,840
Oh my god, they fucking picked me up!

4998
03:33:17,960 --> 03:33:19,480
Oh my god, what is wrong with you?

4999
03:33:21,620 --> 03:33:22,160
Fan!

5000
03:33:22,520 --> 03:33:23,400
Oh shit!

5001
03:33:25,020 --> 03:33:26,040
Oh my god!

5002
03:33:26,500 --> 03:33:27,040
Fan!

5003
03:33:28,560 --> 03:33:29,360
Fan bunnies!

5004
03:33:29,740 --> 03:33:30,880
Fan bunnies!

5005
03:33:31,160 --> 03:33:31,620
Fan bunnies!

5006
03:33:32,900 --> 03:33:33,300
Ah!

5007
03:33:33,560 --> 03:33:34,300
Get me outta here!

5008
03:33:34,700 --> 03:33:35,900
Get me outta here!

5009
03:33:37,400 --> 03:33:38,640
We need to use...

5010
03:33:38,640 --> 03:33:39,880
Are you gonna get up to the mountain?

5011
03:33:40,180 --> 03:33:40,860
Sure, if it worked.

5012
03:33:41,120 --> 03:33:41,420
Here, man.

5013
03:33:41,520 --> 03:33:42,220
Notice the bunny children?

5014
03:33:42,400 --> 03:33:43,580
They dislike splatters.

5015
03:33:44,080 --> 03:33:44,440
Which...

5016
03:33:44,440 --> 03:33:45,140
How does it go?

5017
03:33:45,580 --> 03:33:47,300
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

5018
03:33:47,880 --> 03:33:49,900
Anyway, there should be some TVs nearby.

5019
03:33:50,020 --> 03:33:51,280
Now, power this piece of junk.

5020
03:33:52,120 --> 03:33:53,360
Paint them to activate.

5021
03:33:53,560 --> 03:33:54,720
They'll be able to clear that way.

5022
03:33:54,720 --> 03:33:56,040
Oh my god.

5023
03:33:56,040 --> 03:33:56,580
Get them away.

5024
03:33:56,740 --> 03:33:57,540
Oh my god.

5025
03:33:57,660 --> 03:33:57,980
They're tall.

5026
03:33:58,540 --> 03:33:58,980
Oh my god.

5027
03:33:59,020 --> 03:34:00,440
Oswald, control your children!

5028
03:34:00,760 --> 03:34:01,020
Oswald!

5029
03:34:01,420 --> 03:34:02,640
Control your kids!

5030
03:34:08,120 --> 03:34:09,920
Oh my god, time has slowed.

5031
03:34:10,940 --> 03:34:12,480
I don't know where to go.

5032
03:34:13,460 --> 03:34:16,300
I slowed the time, but where do I go?

5033
03:34:20,060 --> 03:34:20,520
Okay.

5034
03:34:24,500 --> 03:34:26,120
Jesus, this is so dystopian.

5035
03:34:30,340 --> 03:34:31,040
Wait, what?

5036
03:34:31,220 --> 03:34:31,700
Why can't...

5037
03:34:31,700 --> 03:34:31,920
Oh!

5038
03:34:32,180 --> 03:34:32,760
That's a thinner!

5039
03:34:35,700 --> 03:34:36,160
Okay.

5040
03:34:37,160 --> 03:34:39,100
Oswald is a bad father!

5041
03:34:43,460 --> 03:34:44,860
Okay, where the fuck do I go?

5042
03:34:44,880 --> 03:34:45,740
Oh my god, they're all...

5043
03:34:45,740 --> 03:34:46,460
Look at him.

5044
03:34:46,660 --> 03:34:47,720
They're just...

5045
03:34:47,720 --> 03:34:48,880
Waiting for me.

5046
03:34:50,040 --> 03:34:50,820
Look at him.

5047
03:34:52,560 --> 03:34:53,540
Oh my god.

5048
03:34:53,660 --> 03:34:54,980
Oh my god.

5049
03:34:55,260 --> 03:34:56,400
Oh my god.

5050
03:34:56,420 --> 03:34:56,620
Oh my god, friend!

5051
03:34:59,980 --> 03:35:01,320
Oh my god, don't let him pick me up.

5052
03:35:01,520 --> 03:35:02,620
Don't let him touch me.

5053
03:35:04,780 --> 03:35:05,840
Get them away from me.

5054
03:35:06,100 --> 03:35:07,040
Get them away from me.

5055
03:35:07,920 --> 03:35:09,020
Get them away from me.

5056
03:35:11,670 --> 03:35:13,050
Did he just eat him?

5057
03:35:15,690 --> 03:35:17,050
Why is he so big?

5058
03:35:18,130 --> 03:35:18,730
Oh!

5059
03:35:20,490 --> 03:35:21,090
Oh!

5060
03:35:26,530 --> 03:35:27,130
Oh!

5061
03:35:28,910 --> 03:35:30,710
Alright, we just gotta...

5062
03:35:30,710 --> 03:35:32,810
We gotta make sure we're not next to that.

5063
03:35:35,610 --> 03:35:36,210
Friend.

5064
03:35:38,450 --> 03:35:39,050
Oh!

5065
03:35:42,010 --> 03:35:43,750
Okay, we gotta get him in here.

5066
03:35:45,110 --> 03:35:45,710
That's...

5067
03:35:45,710 --> 03:35:46,310
I was like wondering.

5068
03:35:46,450 --> 03:35:47,310
Why is he so big?

5069
03:35:48,550 --> 03:35:49,770
He's so much bigger.

5070
03:35:51,730 --> 03:35:52,950
I was free at...

5071
03:35:52,950 --> 03:35:53,430
The Gremlin.

5072
03:35:55,810 --> 03:35:56,290
Hello?

5073
03:35:57,690 --> 03:36:00,870
Well Mickey, now that I'm free, I can use my special gift in your service.

5074
03:36:01,130 --> 03:36:02,930
My original training was in...

5075
03:36:02,930 --> 03:36:03,470
Crane repair.

5076
03:36:03,870 --> 03:36:05,410
I'll fix this one in a jiffy.

5077
03:36:08,230 --> 03:36:09,530
Which crane is this one?

5078
03:36:14,710 --> 03:36:15,750
Oh, nice!

5079
03:36:16,410 --> 03:36:17,030
You did it!

5080
03:36:17,190 --> 03:36:17,810
Watch this!

5081
03:36:24,120 --> 03:36:25,140
What is he doing?

5082
03:36:30,780 --> 03:36:31,340
Oh!

5083
03:36:34,080 --> 03:36:35,060
Be warned.

5084
03:36:35,300 --> 03:36:36,660
Not many have returned.

5085
03:36:38,680 --> 03:36:39,500
Oh no.

5086
03:36:40,800 --> 03:36:41,600
Don't worry.

5087
03:36:41,840 --> 03:36:42,760
I'm Mickey Mouse.

5088
03:36:43,000 --> 03:36:44,220
I'm the main character.

5089
03:36:44,440 --> 03:36:46,400
Nothing bad will happen to the main character.

5090
03:36:50,360 --> 03:36:51,400
Okay, let's go this way.

5091
03:36:53,100 --> 03:36:54,020
And then...

5092
03:36:55,460 --> 03:36:56,040
Oh yay!

5093
03:36:56,160 --> 03:36:56,380
Money!

5094
03:36:57,200 --> 03:36:57,660
Bee!

5095
03:37:00,920 --> 03:37:01,380
Okay.

5096
03:37:06,080 --> 03:37:06,540
Oh...

5097
03:37:07,360 --> 03:37:09,340
Just gotta make sure everything is good.

5098
03:37:09,660 --> 03:37:11,020
What is like over there?

5099
03:37:11,200 --> 03:37:11,520
Oh my god!

5100
03:37:11,640 --> 03:37:12,220
Get away from me!

5101
03:37:12,320 --> 03:37:13,140
Get away from me kids!

5102
03:37:13,360 --> 03:37:13,800
Get away!

5103
03:37:15,080 --> 03:37:16,340
Don't touch me!

5104
03:37:16,580 --> 03:37:17,300
Don't touch me!

5105
03:37:21,580 --> 03:37:22,820
I wanna go there!

5106
03:37:23,180 --> 03:37:24,080
But I don't know if I can.

5107
03:37:26,400 --> 03:37:27,760
You guys see that, right?

5108
03:37:27,860 --> 03:37:28,940
There's something over here.

5109
03:37:30,820 --> 03:37:31,500
Oh my god.

5110
03:37:31,560 --> 03:37:32,560
They're just waiting for me.

5111
03:37:32,980 --> 03:37:34,120
They're just waiting for me.

5112
03:37:34,180 --> 03:37:35,040
These fucking bricks.

5113
03:37:35,900 --> 03:37:36,660
Oh, thank god.

5114
03:37:39,160 --> 03:37:40,640
How do I get over there?

5115
03:37:40,840 --> 03:37:41,860
Oh, maybe from here?

5116
03:37:43,500 --> 03:37:44,480
Oh, it's from here.

5117
03:37:44,660 --> 03:37:44,820
Okay.

5118
03:37:49,240 --> 03:37:49,940
Okay.

5119
03:37:50,780 --> 03:37:52,100
I can make it.

5120
03:37:53,020 --> 03:37:54,280
Okay, that's fine.

5121
03:37:54,900 --> 03:37:55,980
Get away, children.

5122
03:37:56,800 --> 03:37:58,040
Get away, child!

5123
03:37:58,460 --> 03:37:59,860
Don't touch me!

5124
03:38:10,000 --> 03:38:11,360
I forgot what happened.

5125
03:38:16,660 --> 03:38:18,640
Nothing bad has happened, guys.

5126
03:38:18,900 --> 03:38:20,380
Nothing bad happened.

5127
03:38:20,380 --> 03:38:22,320
Nothing bad.

5128
03:38:22,800 --> 03:38:23,320
Friend.

5129
03:38:24,600 --> 03:38:25,340
Friendship.

5130
03:38:26,820 --> 03:38:27,560
Friendship.

5131
03:38:28,440 --> 03:38:29,180
Friendship.

5132
03:38:33,020 --> 03:38:34,500
No, no, no.

5133
03:38:35,440 --> 03:38:36,180
Friendship.

5134
03:38:38,280 --> 03:38:39,020
Friendship.

5135
03:38:39,440 --> 03:38:39,860
Guys.

5136
03:38:43,600 --> 03:38:44,720
What's over here?

5137
03:38:45,580 --> 03:38:46,240
Oh, shit!

5138
03:38:46,400 --> 03:38:47,080
Guys, what was the number?

5139
03:38:47,220 --> 03:38:47,800
Guys, guys!

5140
03:38:47,800 --> 03:38:48,800
What was the number?

5141
03:38:49,000 --> 03:38:49,180
I...

5142
03:38:49,180 --> 03:38:49,620
726?

5143
03:38:50,180 --> 03:38:51,160
I didn't remember!

5144
03:38:51,720 --> 03:38:52,920
What was...

5145
03:38:55,380 --> 03:38:56,360
What was the number?

5146
03:38:56,460 --> 03:38:57,200
726, right?

5147
03:38:57,320 --> 03:38:57,500
Okay.

5148
03:38:59,020 --> 03:38:59,540
7...

5149
03:39:01,180 --> 03:39:01,700
2...

5150
03:39:01,700 --> 03:39:02,200
6.

5151
03:39:03,680 --> 03:39:04,460
Hello, hello?

5152
03:39:04,740 --> 03:39:07,140
My connection to Mickey Junk Mountain is restored again.

5153
03:39:08,100 --> 03:39:08,400
Mickey.

5154
03:39:08,980 --> 03:39:11,620
Mickey, make sure to come back to the Nasdawn for a reward.

5155
03:39:11,960 --> 03:39:12,580
Okay, I did it.

5156
03:39:13,700 --> 03:39:14,300
Friendship.

5157
03:39:16,900 --> 03:39:17,780
Oh, look!

5158
03:39:17,840 --> 03:39:18,000
See?

5159
03:39:18,100 --> 03:39:18,980
They're watching TV!

5160
03:39:21,560 --> 03:39:24,120
Peak friendship right there, guys.

5161
03:39:25,120 --> 03:39:26,340
Oh, my God.

5162
03:39:26,520 --> 03:39:28,620
They're all waiting for me.

5163
03:39:29,540 --> 03:39:30,420
They're all...

5164
03:39:31,500 --> 03:39:32,940
They're all waiting.

5165
03:39:32,940 --> 03:39:35,320
I see them right now.

5166
03:39:45,350 --> 03:39:48,110
The children yearn for the hugs.

5167
03:39:49,630 --> 03:39:50,650
Oh, my God.

5168
03:39:51,250 --> 03:39:53,350
I should've been giving the TV right here.

5169
03:39:54,310 --> 03:39:54,910
Get away!

5170
03:39:56,070 --> 03:39:57,290
Watch your TV!

5171
03:39:58,890 --> 03:39:59,730
Oh, my God.

5172
03:39:59,930 --> 03:40:02,030
The children has been satisfied.

5173
03:40:04,510 --> 03:40:05,030
Okay.

5174
03:40:05,270 --> 03:40:05,830
Okay, that's good.

5175
03:40:06,090 --> 03:40:07,390
They started watching TV.

5176
03:40:09,350 --> 03:40:09,870
Right.

5177
03:40:10,490 --> 03:40:11,350
Get up there again.

5178
03:40:11,950 --> 03:40:12,490
Let's this way.

5179
03:40:16,250 --> 03:40:16,910
It's okay.

5180
03:40:16,950 --> 03:40:17,730
They've been satisfied.

5181
03:40:18,310 --> 03:40:19,750
They're watching TV now.

5182
03:40:20,710 --> 03:40:22,130
They can't hurt me no more.

5183
03:40:26,480 --> 03:40:27,500
Yeah, I'm ready.

5184
03:40:32,660 --> 03:40:33,400
I'm ready.

5185
03:40:35,300 --> 03:40:36,000
All right.

5186
03:40:36,740 --> 03:40:37,160
Oh!

5187
03:40:37,380 --> 03:40:38,260
Is this a...

5188
03:40:38,260 --> 03:40:38,920
Beanstalk?

5189
03:40:39,960 --> 03:40:42,140
I didn't see the film for this.

5190
03:40:44,160 --> 03:40:44,720
What?

5191
03:40:44,760 --> 03:40:46,100
I didn't see the title of this one.

5192
03:40:50,420 --> 03:40:51,780
Oh, there's the film.

5193
03:40:53,160 --> 03:40:53,600
No!

5194
03:40:54,100 --> 03:40:54,380
Aw!

5195
03:40:55,160 --> 03:40:55,640
End.

5196
03:40:58,980 --> 03:40:59,940
Uh, Darkblade!

5197
03:41:00,100 --> 03:41:00,880
Did you have a super chat?

5198
03:41:00,980 --> 03:41:01,440
Did you think?

5199
03:41:01,660 --> 03:41:01,940
Yeah.

5200
03:41:02,600 --> 03:41:02,940
Epic battle.

5201
03:41:03,100 --> 03:41:04,000
We've all been waiting for.

5202
03:41:04,200 --> 03:41:06,840
Doki bird versus iPad kid colorized.

5203
03:41:06,940 --> 03:41:07,220
Oh, no.

5204
03:41:07,320 --> 03:41:07,680
It's not.

5205
03:41:07,980 --> 03:41:09,860
It's something to do with the...

5206
03:41:09,860 --> 03:41:10,640
The goats.

5207
03:41:13,640 --> 03:41:14,600
Alpine climbers.

5208
03:41:15,520 --> 03:41:18,020
I feel like I've seen an episode of this, but...

5209
03:41:18,020 --> 03:41:18,460
I'm not sure.

5210
03:41:19,240 --> 03:41:20,640
It is a little familiar.

5211
03:41:23,080 --> 03:41:24,500
I don't think I can beat him up.

5212
03:41:25,260 --> 03:41:26,940
I think he'll beat me up before.

5213
03:41:27,360 --> 03:41:27,940
Oh, no!

5214
03:41:28,020 --> 03:41:28,920
I can use it as a platform.

5215
03:41:29,180 --> 03:41:29,420
Nice.

5216
03:41:33,340 --> 03:41:34,440
It's just an egg.

5217
03:41:35,980 --> 03:41:36,580
The fuck?

5218
03:41:38,100 --> 03:41:40,400
Okay, I think that guy is mad at me.

5219
03:41:42,580 --> 03:41:43,120
Oh, no.

5220
03:41:43,180 --> 03:41:44,480
I can use him as a platform.

5221
03:41:44,740 --> 03:41:45,000
Nice.

5222
03:41:48,780 --> 03:41:49,140
Okay.

5223
03:41:54,470 --> 03:41:55,270
This is...

5224
03:41:56,610 --> 03:41:57,530
Can I crack it?

5225
03:41:57,670 --> 03:41:57,870
No.

5226
03:41:58,110 --> 03:41:58,190
Okay.

5227
03:41:59,890 --> 03:42:01,030
Guys, it's not a...

5228
03:42:01,030 --> 03:42:02,830
I'm not doing an evil thing, but I do.

5229
03:42:02,930 --> 03:42:05,410
I'm just curious if I can crack it, you know?

5230
03:42:06,050 --> 03:42:07,490
Like, it's just curiosity.

5231
03:42:10,230 --> 03:42:11,210
Okay, this way.

5232
03:42:12,950 --> 03:42:13,970
Not the egg.

5233
03:42:14,130 --> 03:42:14,610
Maybe...

5234
03:42:14,610 --> 03:42:16,730
I thought it would be like a little Easter egg, you know?

5235
03:42:16,890 --> 03:42:17,330
You get it?

5236
03:42:17,710 --> 03:42:17,950
Aha!

5237
03:42:20,110 --> 03:42:22,210
Like a little Easter egg.

5238
03:42:25,150 --> 03:42:25,630
Okay.

5239
03:42:26,230 --> 03:42:28,030
I'm ready to enter the pile.

5240
03:42:35,150 --> 03:42:36,210
Alright, let me get in.

5241
03:42:40,580 --> 03:42:41,660
This is Hopper.

5242
03:42:41,840 --> 03:42:43,880
The simplest form of Beetleworks.

5243
03:42:44,040 --> 03:42:45,040
What the fuck?

5244
03:42:48,720 --> 03:42:51,020
Then I can remove it, but it does no damage.

5245
03:42:51,200 --> 03:42:52,740
You have to clobber them up close.

5246
03:42:54,460 --> 03:42:55,560
Oh, I can kill.

5247
03:42:55,760 --> 03:42:56,640
I can murder now.

5248
03:42:57,720 --> 03:42:59,500
Guys, they're not fixable, so it's fine.

5249
03:42:59,860 --> 03:43:00,660
Murder is okay.

5250
03:43:01,100 --> 03:43:02,180
You can't fix them.

5251
03:43:05,020 --> 03:43:05,720
Here we go.

5252
03:43:06,280 --> 03:43:06,780
That's right.

5253
03:43:06,820 --> 03:43:07,720
You're not fixable.

5254
03:43:09,420 --> 03:43:11,320
Death is all you deserve.

5255
03:43:13,000 --> 03:43:14,940
Oh dear, most of them broke through.

5256
03:43:15,300 --> 03:43:15,780
That's right.

5257
03:43:17,080 --> 03:43:17,740
Boom!

5258
03:43:20,110 --> 03:43:20,640
That's right.

5259
03:43:21,840 --> 03:43:23,680
I know you're not fixable.

5260
03:43:27,020 --> 03:43:27,760
You're...

5261
03:43:27,760 --> 03:43:29,200
You're beyond redeemable.

5262
03:43:29,580 --> 03:43:30,980
Murder is okay.

5263
03:43:31,320 --> 03:43:33,490
Murder is okay when you're beyond redeemable.

5264
03:43:37,250 --> 03:43:39,330
Okay, I just gotta make sure I'm not missing anything.

5265
03:43:40,970 --> 03:43:42,210
Alright, let's go this way.

5266
03:43:44,350 --> 03:43:45,850
Alright, up we go.

5267
03:43:48,510 --> 03:43:48,990
Finally!

5268
03:43:52,550 --> 03:43:55,030
Finally I can do what I was born to do.

5269
03:43:58,230 --> 03:44:00,630
My intrusive thoughts can finally win.

5270
03:44:04,470 --> 03:44:05,150
What's this?

5271
03:44:08,030 --> 03:44:08,470
What?

5272
03:44:10,030 --> 03:44:10,470
Oh.

5273
03:44:10,750 --> 03:44:11,910
Okay, that's how you stop it.

5274
03:44:11,990 --> 03:44:13,010
I was like, what the fuck is that?

5275
03:44:18,160 --> 03:44:18,600
Alright.

5276
03:44:21,800 --> 03:44:22,920
That's a spladoosh.

5277
03:44:23,120 --> 03:44:25,020
They tend to sleep, and that's a good thing.

5278
03:44:25,160 --> 03:44:27,920
When they're awake, they're very excitable, and they later explode.

5279
03:44:28,140 --> 03:44:30,020
And believe me, you'd agitate them.

5280
03:44:30,180 --> 03:44:31,840
Luckily, they can't move at all.

5281
03:44:35,100 --> 03:44:35,940
Friend.

5282
03:44:38,080 --> 03:44:38,920
Yeah!

5283
03:44:41,180 --> 03:44:42,960
You can just make them friend.

5284
03:44:45,140 --> 03:44:45,980
See?

5285
03:44:46,400 --> 03:44:47,240
Friend.

5286
03:44:50,040 --> 03:44:50,880
Friend.

5287
03:44:52,980 --> 03:44:53,820
Friend.

5288
03:44:57,930 --> 03:44:58,570
Oh, see?

5289
03:44:58,690 --> 03:45:00,770
Oh, when they're friends, they'll sleep forever.

5290
03:45:01,770 --> 03:45:04,110
Yeah, why self when... Exactly!

5291
03:45:06,170 --> 03:45:07,310
Okay, can you feel like...

5292
03:45:07,310 --> 03:45:07,570
I don't know.

5293
03:45:07,850 --> 03:45:08,610
Okay, here we go.

5294
03:45:12,110 --> 03:45:14,150
Come to a friend, and they'll sleep forever.

5295
03:45:16,250 --> 03:45:16,990
Wait, what?

5296
03:45:18,050 --> 03:45:19,250
Why isn't it working?

5297
03:45:22,860 --> 03:45:25,320
Oh, I have to put thinner in there.

5298
03:45:26,240 --> 03:45:26,600
Right?

5299
03:45:28,480 --> 03:45:29,480
If I have to?

5300
03:45:37,100 --> 03:45:37,620
No.

5301
03:45:37,660 --> 03:45:38,260
I already put thinner.

5302
03:45:38,580 --> 03:45:39,200
Wait, what?

5303
03:45:39,540 --> 03:45:41,100
Oh, I opened the path!

5304
03:45:41,480 --> 03:45:41,700
Oh!

5305
03:45:42,220 --> 03:45:43,340
Okay, I was like so confused.

5306
03:45:47,480 --> 03:45:49,360
Arv is still...

5307
03:45:49,660 --> 03:45:49,920
...running.

5308
03:45:53,410 --> 03:45:53,930
Okay.

5309
03:45:58,870 --> 03:45:59,850
Oh, this is easy.

5310
03:46:03,950 --> 03:46:05,550
I'll just dash through it.

5311
03:46:08,650 --> 03:46:09,250
Alright.

5312
03:46:09,770 --> 03:46:10,290
Alright.

5313
03:46:10,290 --> 03:46:10,690
So easy.

5314
03:46:13,770 --> 03:46:15,130
Am I missing anything?

5315
03:46:15,450 --> 03:46:16,470
Is there anything above me?

5316
03:46:16,910 --> 03:46:17,950
Oh, wait, what?

5317
03:46:19,250 --> 03:46:20,550
Wait, what the fuck?

5318
03:46:20,850 --> 03:46:21,250
Oh!

5319
03:46:21,570 --> 03:46:21,970
Would that...

5320
03:46:21,970 --> 03:46:23,270
That would be the danger...

5321
03:46:23,270 --> 03:46:23,890
Oh!

5322
03:46:24,130 --> 03:46:25,110
If I decide...

5323
03:46:25,110 --> 03:46:26,970
This is the easy path.

5324
03:46:26,970 --> 03:46:28,230
And then like...

5325
03:46:28,230 --> 03:46:31,330
If I decide to be a bad person...

5326
03:46:31,330 --> 03:46:32,170
They would make me parkour!

5327
03:46:33,430 --> 03:46:33,950
Oh!

5328
03:46:35,050 --> 03:46:35,950
I see.

5329
03:46:36,450 --> 03:46:38,230
Yeah, cause I was like wondering like...

5330
03:46:38,230 --> 03:46:39,250
Wait, this is so easy.

5331
03:46:41,970 --> 03:46:43,090
Yeah, I got the...

5332
03:46:43,090 --> 03:46:44,370
Cause like look at the green stuff.

5333
03:46:44,670 --> 03:46:46,150
This has to be the easy part.

5334
03:46:46,630 --> 03:46:46,990
Right?

5335
03:46:48,210 --> 03:46:49,050
Cause like...

5336
03:46:49,050 --> 03:46:50,610
What's the green stuff over there?

5337
03:46:52,070 --> 03:46:53,170
Being evil is...

5338
03:46:53,170 --> 03:46:55,190
Why be evil when I can just...

5339
03:46:56,390 --> 03:46:58,570
I can just do this the easy way.

5340
03:46:59,230 --> 03:47:00,490
Crime never pays.

5341
03:47:04,070 --> 03:47:04,550
Ow.

5342
03:47:04,890 --> 03:47:04,990
Ow.

5343
03:47:05,150 --> 03:47:05,210
Ow.

5344
03:47:05,330 --> 03:47:05,590
Ow.

5345
03:47:05,590 --> 03:47:06,410
Oh my...

5346
03:47:07,230 --> 03:47:07,990
What the fuck?

5347
03:47:08,430 --> 03:47:09,830
What the fuck is that?

5348
03:47:11,230 --> 03:47:11,990
I was like...

5349
03:47:11,990 --> 03:47:13,610
Why would there be the green stuff?

5350
03:47:16,510 --> 03:47:17,330
Yeah, I know.

5351
03:47:17,470 --> 03:47:17,930
I was like...

5352
03:47:17,930 --> 03:47:18,490
Excuse me?

5353
03:47:19,450 --> 03:47:19,930
Like...

5354
03:47:20,930 --> 03:47:21,750
Oh my god.

5355
03:47:21,810 --> 03:47:22,050
Okay.

5356
03:47:25,190 --> 03:47:25,770
My tickets.

5357
03:47:28,810 --> 03:47:30,190
Okay, I'm just gonna...

5358
03:47:30,190 --> 03:47:30,870
Do that.

5359
03:47:38,660 --> 03:47:39,600
Okay, we made it.

5360
03:47:40,980 --> 03:47:43,060
Yeah, this is such an easy parkour.

5361
03:47:45,120 --> 03:47:45,880
What's this?

5362
03:47:46,260 --> 03:47:47,480
That looks the way out.

5363
03:47:49,920 --> 03:47:50,560
RUN!

5364
03:48:01,640 --> 03:48:02,580
Pressure beam!

5365
03:48:03,860 --> 03:48:04,840
Pressure beam!

5366
03:48:05,780 --> 03:48:06,380
There we go.

5367
03:48:10,260 --> 03:48:12,460
You shall become a dragoon.

5368
03:48:13,260 --> 03:48:14,620
Wait, why is there another call?

5369
03:48:19,640 --> 03:48:20,400
Wait.

5370
03:48:20,880 --> 03:48:21,380
Nine.

5371
03:48:23,360 --> 03:48:24,120
One.

5372
03:48:25,740 --> 03:48:27,520
Is that a wrong number on the phone?

5373
03:48:31,500 --> 03:48:32,260
Wait.

5374
03:48:34,120 --> 03:48:34,880
Nine.

5375
03:48:36,400 --> 03:48:37,320
One.

5376
03:48:37,780 --> 03:48:38,500
One.

5377
03:48:40,160 --> 03:48:40,960
Oh shit.

5378
03:48:41,980 --> 03:48:43,540
Wait, try one, one.

5379
03:48:43,920 --> 03:48:44,240
One.

5380
03:48:44,920 --> 03:48:45,440
One.

5381
03:48:46,000 --> 03:48:46,580
Two.

5382
03:48:48,280 --> 03:48:49,200
Aw.

5383
03:48:49,520 --> 03:48:50,080
No call.

5384
03:48:52,260 --> 03:48:53,600
I got them.

5385
03:49:04,410 --> 03:49:08,030
What if, like, I do that and the game fucking deletes inside?

5386
03:49:10,770 --> 03:49:12,450
Disney lawyers will get me.

5387
03:49:13,370 --> 03:49:14,390
Oh, there's something over here.

5388
03:49:19,380 --> 03:49:21,620
I like how the melee is, like, an extra jump.

5389
03:49:22,220 --> 03:49:23,420
I like that mechanic.

5390
03:49:26,640 --> 03:49:27,520
Can I make that?

5391
03:49:27,680 --> 03:49:29,100
No, I have to actually do this.

5392
03:49:33,560 --> 03:49:34,000
There.

5393
03:49:36,100 --> 03:49:37,700
Alright, we gotta do this one.

5394
03:49:41,100 --> 03:49:42,300
Can I make this?

5395
03:49:43,760 --> 03:49:44,560
Yeah, I can.

5396
03:49:46,060 --> 03:49:46,620
Yeah.

5397
03:49:47,920 --> 03:49:48,480
Burn.

5398
03:49:51,600 --> 03:49:52,540
Wait a minute.

5399
03:49:53,540 --> 03:49:54,260
Wait, my brush.

5400
03:49:55,560 --> 03:49:56,120
Okay.

5401
03:49:56,380 --> 03:49:56,620
Nice.

5402
03:49:58,120 --> 03:49:59,180
Oh fuck, I forgot.

5403
03:49:59,400 --> 03:50:00,140
Your doctor's a bullet.

5404
03:50:01,680 --> 03:50:02,240
Okay.

5405
03:50:09,870 --> 03:50:10,370
Okay.

5406
03:50:10,470 --> 03:50:10,730
Okay, nice.

5407
03:50:10,870 --> 03:50:11,510
Oh my god.

5408
03:50:11,510 --> 03:50:12,530
Please keep beating my...

5409
03:50:12,530 --> 03:50:13,510
Oh my god!

5410
03:50:16,210 --> 03:50:17,270
We all saw it.

5411
03:50:17,270 --> 03:50:17,730
He jumped.

5412
03:50:18,310 --> 03:50:19,490
We all saw it.

5413
03:50:19,490 --> 03:50:20,110
He jumped.

5414
03:50:24,150 --> 03:50:25,530
He jumped, guys.

5415
03:50:25,750 --> 03:50:26,630
We all saw it.

5416
03:50:26,630 --> 03:50:26,650
What?

5417
03:50:28,750 --> 03:50:30,550
That was not my fault.

5418
03:50:31,390 --> 03:50:32,930
We couldn't stop him.

5419
03:50:33,050 --> 03:50:33,510
We tried.

5420
03:50:34,510 --> 03:50:34,890
We tried.

5421
03:50:37,710 --> 03:50:39,630
The casualty of war.

5422
03:50:40,230 --> 03:50:43,010
He was a good man.

5423
03:50:43,270 --> 03:50:45,950
But he had to fight his own inner demons.

5424
03:50:46,530 --> 03:50:47,930
We all saw it.

5425
03:50:50,790 --> 03:50:51,410
Okay.

5426
03:50:52,210 --> 03:50:53,110
Let's see.

5427
03:50:54,210 --> 03:50:55,190
Wait, we go this way.

5428
03:50:56,630 --> 03:50:57,370
I got it.

5429
03:50:57,610 --> 03:50:59,450
They're alive with this.

5430
03:51:01,590 --> 03:51:02,330
All right.

5431
03:51:02,550 --> 03:51:03,830
I'm ready to climb the mountains.

5432
03:51:04,350 --> 03:51:07,050
Okay, why did you push him?

5433
03:51:07,250 --> 03:51:08,130
What do you mean?

5434
03:51:11,850 --> 03:51:12,970
He knew.

5435
03:51:13,910 --> 03:51:15,790
We all saw what happened.

5436
03:51:23,290 --> 03:51:24,150
Oh, wait.

5437
03:51:24,230 --> 03:51:28,140
I remember this dog.

5438
03:51:28,460 --> 03:51:29,440
From that move...

5439
03:51:29,440 --> 03:51:30,580
From the episode.

5440
03:51:32,560 --> 03:51:33,620
I remember...

5441
03:51:33,620 --> 03:51:34,460
I know that dog.

5442
03:51:38,810 --> 03:51:39,590
Okay.

5443
03:51:39,730 --> 03:51:40,270
Let's get this.

5444
03:51:43,430 --> 03:51:44,350
All right.

5445
03:51:45,130 --> 03:51:46,550
Let's grab this.

5446
03:51:47,690 --> 03:51:48,190
And then...

5447
03:51:48,190 --> 03:51:48,370
No!

5448
03:51:49,530 --> 03:51:50,310
No!

5449
03:51:50,870 --> 03:51:51,370
Stupid...

5450
03:51:51,370 --> 03:51:51,610
Oh!

5451
03:51:51,930 --> 03:51:52,830
Stupid bird.

5452
03:51:52,830 --> 03:51:55,070
Don't make me look bad.

5453
03:51:55,590 --> 03:51:56,790
Booga booga booga booga.

5454
03:51:58,950 --> 03:51:59,830
All right.

5455
03:52:01,730 --> 03:52:03,090
We just have to wait.

5456
03:52:03,850 --> 03:52:04,810
I can be patient.

5457
03:52:08,720 --> 03:52:10,000
I should survive that.

5458
03:52:13,550 --> 03:52:15,490
I'm a parkour queen!

5459
03:52:18,150 --> 03:52:19,190
Okay.

5460
03:52:19,910 --> 03:52:20,970
Grab this.

5461
03:52:21,650 --> 03:52:22,750
Grab the money.

5462
03:52:23,710 --> 03:52:24,450
And then...

5463
03:52:25,030 --> 03:52:26,430
Grab the film.

5464
03:52:26,850 --> 03:52:27,130
Yay!

5465
03:52:28,050 --> 03:52:29,090
Oh, shit!

5466
03:52:29,250 --> 03:52:30,510
I'm okay.

5467
03:52:31,030 --> 03:52:32,410
I'm okay.

5468
03:52:33,090 --> 03:52:34,390
Just a little accident.

5469
03:52:35,690 --> 03:52:36,510
Yes.

5470
03:52:44,890 --> 03:52:45,430
All right.

5471
03:52:46,970 --> 03:52:47,370
Oh.

5472
03:52:49,710 --> 03:52:50,330
Excuse us.

5473
03:52:50,470 --> 03:52:51,850
We need to go in and see Oswald.

5474
03:52:52,530 --> 03:52:52,930
Sorry.

5475
03:52:53,130 --> 03:52:54,550
That door is out of commission.

5476
03:52:54,810 --> 03:52:55,930
No power, you see.

5477
03:52:57,030 --> 03:52:57,950
Even it worked.

5478
03:52:58,090 --> 03:52:59,270
And I can't open that door.

5479
03:52:59,390 --> 03:53:00,790
It's not as bald things are about.

5480
03:53:01,450 --> 03:53:02,830
Get rid of them and I'll open the door.

5481
03:53:03,010 --> 03:53:04,650
Or you can try powering it yourself.

5482
03:53:06,830 --> 03:53:08,950
I like this hut where Gilda left your axe.

5483
03:53:09,190 --> 03:53:10,330
Is up on that ledge.

5484
03:53:10,330 --> 03:53:11,950
How do we reach it?

5485
03:53:13,070 --> 03:53:13,670
All right.

5486
03:53:14,590 --> 03:53:16,270
We gotta send the mountains.

5487
03:53:17,330 --> 03:53:18,270
Knock, knock.

5488
03:53:18,950 --> 03:53:19,690
Wait, what?

5489
03:53:21,010 --> 03:53:22,170
Not fully?

5490
03:53:22,630 --> 03:53:23,510
Wait, what?

5491
03:53:27,110 --> 03:53:27,790
Oh!

5492
03:53:28,550 --> 03:53:30,310
There's a fucking vent!

5493
03:53:30,550 --> 03:53:32,010
Okay, I was gonna say like...

5494
03:53:32,010 --> 03:53:33,050
What the fuck is going on?

5495
03:53:34,330 --> 03:53:35,490
There's like a...

5496
03:53:35,490 --> 03:53:36,770
I didn't see the little droplet.

5497
03:53:38,470 --> 03:53:39,150
Okay.

5498
03:53:42,210 --> 03:53:42,550
Just...

5499
03:53:43,470 --> 03:53:47,050
Just make sure that is friendly first before we do anything.

5500
03:53:50,470 --> 03:53:51,150
Okay.

5501
03:53:51,410 --> 03:53:51,790
Okay.

5502
03:53:55,960 --> 03:53:56,860
All right.

5503
03:53:57,100 --> 03:53:58,440
I'm trying my best.

5504
03:53:59,400 --> 03:54:00,400
Wait, what?

5505
03:54:01,440 --> 03:54:02,920
He just TP's.

5506
03:54:03,280 --> 03:54:04,700
What the fuck just happened?

5507
03:54:05,160 --> 03:54:07,120
He just TP'd out of there.

5508
03:54:07,120 --> 03:54:07,820
Ah!

5509
03:54:12,510 --> 03:54:13,490
Oh my god.

5510
03:54:14,990 --> 03:54:16,710
Okay, let's get rid of him first.

5511
03:54:18,510 --> 03:54:19,550
And then...

5512
03:54:19,550 --> 03:54:20,750
Get rid of him.

5513
03:54:21,190 --> 03:54:22,110
Oh my god.

5514
03:54:22,250 --> 03:54:23,430
I can unfriend them.

5515
03:54:23,790 --> 03:54:25,010
I didn't know that.

5516
03:54:26,850 --> 03:54:29,630
It can be like not friends anymore if I hit them.

5517
03:54:32,550 --> 03:54:33,230
That's right.

5518
03:54:33,390 --> 03:54:34,190
I unfriended you.

5519
03:54:36,030 --> 03:54:36,590
Okay.

5520
03:54:36,870 --> 03:54:36,950
Wait.

5521
03:54:37,050 --> 03:54:38,230
Can I like complete this puzzle?

5522
03:54:39,690 --> 03:54:41,330
How about I complete this puzzle?

5523
03:54:46,560 --> 03:54:47,120
Okay.

5524
03:54:47,260 --> 03:54:48,120
And then...

5525
03:54:48,120 --> 03:54:49,020
Let's grab this guy.

5526
03:54:50,300 --> 03:54:51,760
I unfriended her.

5527
03:54:53,500 --> 03:54:54,580
Thanks for dealing them all.

5528
03:54:54,960 --> 03:54:56,140
I'll store power to the gates.

5529
03:55:02,580 --> 03:55:05,380
Give my regards to our leader Oswald when you see him.

5530
03:55:05,980 --> 03:55:07,460
Okay, so that is the path.

5531
03:55:07,600 --> 03:55:09,160
I need to grab the...

5532
03:55:10,140 --> 03:55:10,580
Goddamn...

5533
03:55:11,040 --> 03:55:11,640
Axe though.

5534
03:55:11,800 --> 03:55:12,180
That's here.

5535
03:55:12,840 --> 03:55:13,980
Oh, I knew it.

5536
03:55:14,140 --> 03:55:14,560
I was like...

5537
03:55:14,560 --> 03:55:15,520
That seems so weird.

5538
03:55:18,580 --> 03:55:20,020
I knew there was something there.

5539
03:55:23,560 --> 03:55:24,000
Yeah!

5540
03:55:24,340 --> 03:55:24,480
Oh!

5541
03:55:24,640 --> 03:55:25,240
Gold pin!

5542
03:55:28,930 --> 03:55:30,070
Grab that here.

5543
03:55:30,210 --> 03:55:31,450
Do I...

5544
03:55:32,830 --> 03:55:33,630
That?

5545
03:55:34,950 --> 03:55:35,750
Like...

5546
03:55:35,750 --> 03:55:36,310
Okay.

5547
03:55:36,750 --> 03:55:37,370
That's it?

5548
03:55:38,450 --> 03:55:40,170
I was like, ooh, a little game?

5549
03:55:41,610 --> 03:55:42,690
First try.

5550
03:55:43,330 --> 03:55:45,110
How do I get...

5551
03:55:45,930 --> 03:55:47,670
How do I get up there?

5552
03:55:50,370 --> 03:55:51,170
Hmm...

5553
03:55:54,540 --> 03:55:55,280
Grab this.

5554
03:55:56,460 --> 03:55:57,260
Okay.

5555
03:55:57,260 --> 03:55:57,420
Okay.

5556
03:55:58,820 --> 03:56:00,340
That activates that.

5557
03:56:02,860 --> 03:56:03,300
Okay.

5558
03:56:04,640 --> 03:56:06,480
Look at all my new friends I made.

5559
03:56:12,130 --> 03:56:12,570
Oh.

5560
03:56:14,950 --> 03:56:15,870
Okay, and then...

5561
03:56:16,890 --> 03:56:17,770
Oh my god, okay.

5562
03:56:17,970 --> 03:56:18,590
We still made it.

5563
03:56:18,670 --> 03:56:19,010
That's good.

5564
03:56:19,970 --> 03:56:20,370
Alright.

5565
03:56:21,210 --> 03:56:23,210
That should get rid of the thinner here.

5566
03:56:25,450 --> 03:56:26,850
I'm balling right now.

5567
03:56:27,770 --> 03:56:28,730
Truly am.

5568
03:56:28,990 --> 03:56:30,250
Okay, there's nothing behind me.

5569
03:56:31,010 --> 03:56:31,370
Oh, hey!

5570
03:56:31,470 --> 03:56:32,110
There's an NES!

5571
03:56:32,430 --> 03:56:34,110
What is this?

5572
03:56:34,370 --> 03:56:35,710
A magical quest.

5573
03:56:37,970 --> 03:56:39,650
Oh, this should be...

5574
03:56:39,650 --> 03:56:41,010
Where I can grab the thing.

5575
03:56:44,530 --> 03:56:45,010
Uh...

5576
03:56:45,010 --> 03:56:45,630
He's not thinner.

5577
03:56:45,810 --> 03:56:46,350
He's not thinner.

5578
03:56:46,350 --> 03:56:46,370
He's not thinner.

5579
03:56:46,490 --> 03:56:46,790
Oh!

5580
03:56:47,030 --> 03:56:47,170
Whoa!

5581
03:56:47,330 --> 03:56:47,630
No!

5582
03:56:49,050 --> 03:56:49,530
Okay.

5583
03:56:50,130 --> 03:56:50,730
Still made it.

5584
03:56:50,810 --> 03:56:51,350
We still made it.

5585
03:56:51,650 --> 03:56:52,010
Nice.

5586
03:56:54,770 --> 03:56:55,250
Oh!

5587
03:56:55,730 --> 03:56:56,030
Nice!

5588
03:56:56,150 --> 03:56:56,490
We did it!

5589
03:56:57,110 --> 03:56:58,890
We have our little...

5590
03:56:59,610 --> 03:57:00,090
Pickaxe.

5591
03:57:00,250 --> 03:57:01,450
Our gildalas.

5592
03:57:04,470 --> 03:57:04,950
Nice.

5593
03:57:05,230 --> 03:57:06,610
There was like, something over here.

5594
03:57:06,790 --> 03:57:08,410
Is it worth doing...

5595
03:57:08,930 --> 03:57:09,450
This one?

5596
03:57:12,110 --> 03:57:13,950
Is it worth doing the one over here?

5597
03:57:17,610 --> 03:57:19,150
Like, what do I get out of that?

5598
03:57:23,610 --> 03:57:24,550
I'm like, wondering...

5599
03:57:24,550 --> 03:57:26,110
What do I get out of doing this one?

5600
03:57:31,340 --> 03:57:32,440
Yeah, but like...

5601
03:57:32,440 --> 03:57:34,520
This is me turning the power on myself.

5602
03:57:34,800 --> 03:57:35,440
So it's like...

5603
03:57:35,440 --> 03:57:36,380
I don't have to do that.

5604
03:57:37,160 --> 03:57:38,060
I already turned it on.

5605
03:57:38,280 --> 03:57:39,720
I guess it's like, the challenge one?

5606
03:57:40,380 --> 03:57:42,460
Is this like, where I want to challenge myself?

5607
03:57:45,540 --> 03:57:46,220
Satisfaction?

5608
03:57:46,420 --> 03:57:47,180
Because I'm like...

5609
03:57:47,180 --> 03:57:48,560
This one was so easy.

5610
03:57:48,720 --> 03:57:50,180
I just like, painted everything.

5611
03:57:50,540 --> 03:57:50,880
But...

5612
03:57:51,160 --> 03:57:52,680
There's more parkour up here.

5613
03:57:53,540 --> 03:57:55,440
The satisfaction of a job?

5614
03:57:55,820 --> 03:57:56,580
Well done.

5615
03:57:57,520 --> 03:57:58,900
Because I'm like...

5616
03:57:58,900 --> 03:57:59,780
I praise.

5617
03:58:00,680 --> 03:58:01,040
Alright.

5618
03:58:01,680 --> 03:58:02,740
If I...

5619
03:58:02,740 --> 03:58:03,840
If I parkour...

5620
03:58:03,840 --> 03:58:04,120
I...

5621
03:58:04,120 --> 03:58:04,840
You know what?

5622
03:58:05,340 --> 03:58:06,400
I want a super chat.

5623
03:58:09,280 --> 03:58:10,520
If I...

5624
03:58:10,520 --> 03:58:11,900
Get all the way up there...

5625
03:58:12,580 --> 03:58:13,860
That's my praise.

5626
03:58:17,240 --> 03:58:17,960
I'll do it.

5627
03:58:18,740 --> 03:58:19,860
That was so easy.

5628
03:58:20,180 --> 03:58:20,560
This...

5629
03:58:20,560 --> 03:58:21,700
This is so easy.

5630
03:58:21,800 --> 03:58:22,420
Watch this.

5631
03:58:23,080 --> 03:58:24,900
I fucking am gaming.

5632
03:58:26,620 --> 03:58:27,780
Get out of here.

5633
03:58:28,260 --> 03:58:28,660
When?

5634
03:58:32,520 --> 03:58:33,380
Wait, but like...

5635
03:58:33,380 --> 03:58:33,860
Where am I...

5636
03:58:33,860 --> 03:58:35,060
Oh my god, it's this.

5637
03:58:35,240 --> 03:58:36,260
I was like, so confused.

5638
03:58:38,440 --> 03:58:38,960
Okay.

5639
03:58:39,100 --> 03:58:39,500
Oh, okay.

5640
03:58:39,800 --> 03:58:40,320
I'll...

5641
03:58:40,320 --> 03:58:41,240
Do that.

5642
03:58:43,740 --> 03:58:44,620
And then...

5643
03:58:46,280 --> 03:58:47,680
Yeah, the door is open now.

5644
03:58:47,680 --> 03:58:48,580
So you don't need...

5645
03:58:48,580 --> 03:58:50,100
But we can if you...

5646
03:58:50,100 --> 03:58:51,420
Yeah, that's what I'm saying!

5647
03:58:51,880 --> 03:58:53,100
That's exactly what I'm saying!

5648
03:58:53,220 --> 03:58:53,260
That's exactly what I'm saying!

5649
03:58:53,260 --> 03:58:55,080
I was like, what do I get out of doing this?

5650
03:58:55,400 --> 03:58:57,220
The other one was so much more easier.

5651
03:59:00,980 --> 03:59:02,560
It's literally the satisfaction.

5652
03:59:07,510 --> 03:59:08,710
It's just a game.

5653
03:59:11,970 --> 03:59:12,490
Okay.

5654
03:59:13,850 --> 03:59:14,630
Wait, what?

5655
03:59:14,850 --> 03:59:15,650
Oh, I...

5656
03:59:15,650 --> 03:59:17,150
I'm like, I was so confused what that was.

5657
03:59:18,590 --> 03:59:19,830
Wait, what the fuck?

5658
03:59:20,030 --> 03:59:20,170
Oh.

5659
03:59:23,310 --> 03:59:23,830
Okay.

5660
03:59:25,290 --> 03:59:25,810
Nice.

5661
03:59:28,450 --> 03:59:30,430
What the fuck is this TV doing here?

5662
03:59:31,510 --> 03:59:32,190
Is that it?

5663
03:59:32,910 --> 03:59:33,850
I did it!

5664
03:59:34,670 --> 03:59:35,970
Wait, that's it?!

5665
03:59:37,630 --> 03:59:39,130
I just turned on the TV?!

5666
03:59:39,630 --> 03:59:40,510
Okay, I did it, guys.

5667
03:59:41,530 --> 03:59:42,350
I did it.

5668
03:59:42,410 --> 03:59:42,950
That was it.

5669
03:59:43,310 --> 03:59:44,330
That was actually it.

5670
03:59:46,950 --> 03:59:48,090
Where's my super chat?

5671
03:59:50,570 --> 03:59:51,970
I got cracked.

5672
03:59:53,270 --> 03:59:54,210
Where is it?

5673
03:59:54,830 --> 03:59:55,750
Where is it?

5674
03:59:57,630 --> 03:59:59,210
I can't do anything near the TV.

5675
03:59:59,970 --> 04:00:00,490
What the fuck?

5676
04:00:01,050 --> 04:00:02,270
What's supposed to be here?

5677
04:00:02,610 --> 04:00:03,510
How do I get down?

5678
04:00:04,310 --> 04:00:05,310
Oh my god.

5679
04:00:05,450 --> 04:00:06,610
To walk all the way down?

5680
04:00:06,970 --> 04:00:07,410
Oh my...

5681
04:00:07,410 --> 04:00:08,890
The hardest part is getting down.

5682
04:00:09,550 --> 04:00:09,990
Boom!

5683
04:00:10,330 --> 04:00:11,270
Thank you for...

5684
04:00:11,270 --> 04:00:12,790
Thank you for the super...

5685
04:00:12,790 --> 04:00:13,510
Oh my god.

5686
04:00:13,810 --> 04:00:15,550
Wait, the hardest part is getting down.

5687
04:00:17,210 --> 04:00:18,570
Thank you for the super...

5688
04:00:19,710 --> 04:00:21,150
Congrats, I guess.

5689
04:00:23,110 --> 04:00:24,790

5690
04:00:24,930 --> 04:00:25,330

Thank you, thank you.

5694
04:00:30,330 --> 04:00:32,410
I mean, I guess you did it.

5695
04:00:35,510 --> 04:00:37,530
How nice, you like painted it all for me.

5696
04:00:37,670 --> 04:00:38,070
I totally did it.

5697
04:00:38,230 --> 04:00:39,610
Like, why the fuck, why did they...

5698
04:00:41,730 --> 04:00:44,370

Congrats.

5701

Paturasi, thank you.

5702
04:00:47,970 --> 04:00:49,090
Yeah, where's my golden star?

5703
04:00:49,310 --> 04:00:50,570
Where's my golden star?

5704
04:00:51,030 --> 04:00:52,410
Thank you for the super chat.

5705
04:00:52,550 --> 04:00:53,430
Thank you, thank you.

5706
04:00:54,190 --> 04:00:56,410
Hey now, this is a kid-friendly game, Missy.

5707
04:00:56,410 --> 04:00:57,710
No swearing allowed.

5708
04:00:58,130 --> 04:00:59,550
Alex, thank you for the super chat.

5709
04:00:59,670 --> 04:01:00,530
Thank you, thank you.

5710
04:01:01,230 --> 04:01:02,290
Alright, we're here.

5711
04:01:03,170 --> 04:01:06,350
Oh, it's like all the like, old merch and stuff they used to do.

5712
04:01:06,570 --> 04:01:08,330
That shit is so creepy though.

5713
04:01:08,750 --> 04:01:11,650
I remember seeing the concept bar for like, some of the Mickey...

5714
04:01:12,930 --> 04:01:13,330
Um...

5715
04:01:13,330 --> 04:01:15,030
Merch, like, in this game.

5716
04:01:15,170 --> 04:01:16,310
And it's so fucking dark.

5717
04:01:19,250 --> 04:01:20,650
I was with a lucky rabbit.

5718
04:01:24,210 --> 04:01:25,190
He was an actor.

5719
04:01:25,350 --> 04:01:26,730
Oh boy, he was an actor?

5720
04:01:27,710 --> 04:01:28,690
Charlie Troubles?

5721
04:01:28,910 --> 04:01:29,910
Oh, what a night.

5722
04:01:30,370 --> 04:01:31,410
Oswald was lost.

5723
04:01:31,530 --> 04:01:32,890
It was in lots of old films.

5724
04:01:33,030 --> 04:01:34,730
He was the first of us to become a star.

5725
04:01:34,990 --> 04:01:36,890
And the first of us to be forgotten.

5726
04:01:38,410 --> 04:01:38,930
Forgotten?

5727
04:01:39,070 --> 04:01:40,190
Why, what happened?

5728
04:01:40,850 --> 04:01:41,830
You happened.

5729
04:01:42,270 --> 04:01:43,150
Oh boy, me?

5730
04:01:43,510 --> 04:01:45,590
It seems pretty popular down here.

5731
04:01:46,110 --> 04:01:47,870
Of course, Oswald runs this place.

5732
04:01:47,950 --> 04:01:48,970
Or at least, he did.

5733
04:01:49,290 --> 04:01:51,010
Before the Sinner Disaster.

5734
04:01:51,910 --> 04:01:52,950
Sinner Disaster?

5735
04:01:53,250 --> 04:01:54,010
Wait, what?

5736
04:01:56,410 --> 04:01:57,450
He fell off.

5737
04:01:57,550 --> 04:01:58,990
He peeked and fell off, guys.

5738
04:01:59,930 --> 04:02:01,510
Star, thank you for the super chat.

5739
04:02:01,650 --> 04:02:01,830
Thank you.

5740
04:02:02,030 --> 04:02:02,430
Thank you.

5741
04:02:02,650 --> 04:02:03,550
One more swear joke.

5742
04:02:03,830 --> 04:02:06,090
And you're out of the Mickey Mouse.

5743
04:02:06,290 --> 04:02:06,550
No!

5744
04:02:07,450 --> 04:02:31,570
M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E Mickey Mouse Donald Duck Mickey Mouse Donald Duck Pa-dum, pa-dum, pa-dum, pa-dum, pa-dum, pa-dum Oh, oh, oh Please, sir.

5745
04:02:31,830 --> 04:02:33,230
Don't kick me out!

5746
04:02:34,470 --> 04:02:35,790
Please, sir.

5747
04:02:36,430 --> 04:02:39,490
Don't kick me out of the Mickey Mouse club!

5748
04:02:41,770 --> 04:02:44,170
I bet I'm good mouse!

5749
04:02:47,110 --> 04:02:49,230
Solid thing of the super chat, think you think?

5750
04:02:49,530 --> 04:02:49,650
Yeah.

5751
04:02:51,230 --> 04:02:51,870
Come on.

5752
04:02:52,050 --> 04:02:52,770
Get no cameras.

5753
04:02:52,990 --> 04:02:53,970
No cameras allowed.

5754
04:02:55,730 --> 04:02:57,950
Looks like he's the one to talk around here.

5755
04:03:01,680 --> 04:03:02,220
Hello?

5756
04:03:04,000 --> 04:03:05,760
Whoa, look at all these cards.

5757
04:03:07,340 --> 04:03:08,060
Here we are.

5758
04:03:11,280 --> 04:03:11,720
Alright.

5759
04:03:12,020 --> 04:03:12,480
Oh, it's you.

5760
04:03:12,640 --> 04:03:14,060
You're not getting in to see him.

5761
04:03:14,400 --> 04:03:16,000
Not unless you pass the sum test.

5762
04:03:16,660 --> 04:03:19,480
Putting a fiver in this weird jar for you.

5763
04:03:20,580 --> 04:03:22,740
Curse, thank you for the super chat that you think you.

5764
04:03:22,980 --> 04:03:24,840
Go through the first projector stream on the left.

5765
04:03:25,180 --> 04:03:26,480
Prepare to have your ticket punched.

5766
04:03:26,860 --> 04:03:28,140
The three challenges.

5767
04:03:28,680 --> 04:03:29,060
Okay.

5768
04:03:30,640 --> 04:03:31,560
Ready for the first challenge?

5769
04:03:31,640 --> 04:03:32,180
Yeah, I am.

5770
04:03:32,620 --> 04:03:33,540
Ah, Mickey Mouse!

5771
04:03:33,640 --> 04:03:35,540
I like how it's the Oswald episode.

5772
04:03:35,540 --> 04:03:37,320
It says, presented by Mickey Mouse.

5773
04:03:37,460 --> 04:03:38,080
That's fucked up.

5774
04:03:39,800 --> 04:03:41,300
Santino, thank you for the super chat.

5775
04:03:41,300 --> 04:03:42,360
Thank you, thank you.

5776
04:03:42,700 --> 04:03:44,540
I only got my first super chat set.

5777
04:03:44,740 --> 04:03:45,560
Good job, Doki.

5778
04:03:45,860 --> 04:03:46,040
Yay!

5779
04:03:46,520 --> 04:03:47,780
I got my gold star.

5780
04:03:48,300 --> 04:03:49,220
Thank you for the super chat.

5781
04:03:49,360 --> 04:03:50,440
Thank you, thank you.

5782
04:03:52,140 --> 04:03:52,620
Yippee!

5783
04:03:52,980 --> 04:03:54,640
My gold star!

5784
04:03:55,420 --> 04:03:56,740
Whoa, it's Extendo.

5785
04:03:59,780 --> 04:04:00,620
Don't worry.

5786
04:04:01,240 --> 04:04:02,320
I got it.

5787
04:04:02,500 --> 04:04:04,840
I got that stupid cow out of here.

5788
04:04:09,920 --> 04:04:10,900
Extend your...

5789
04:04:10,900 --> 04:04:12,060
Extend your neck!

5790
04:04:13,260 --> 04:04:13,640
Okay.

5791
04:04:15,200 --> 04:04:16,180
Alright, we gotta go up.

5792
04:04:17,180 --> 04:04:18,720
Actually, do we go up?

5793
04:04:18,880 --> 04:04:19,860
Oh wait, yeah, we do.

5794
04:04:20,740 --> 04:04:22,000
That's where the film is.

5795
04:04:22,940 --> 04:04:24,100
The trolley troubles.

5796
04:04:25,300 --> 04:04:26,620
Go, go Gadget Mickey!

5797
04:04:28,520 --> 04:04:29,140
Eh?

5798
04:04:33,430 --> 04:04:34,510
What's this do?

5799
04:04:36,030 --> 04:04:37,430
I don't know what that did.

5800
04:04:41,210 --> 04:04:43,010
This is not really much of a challenge.

5801
04:04:43,350 --> 04:04:44,690
To be fair.

5802
04:04:45,830 --> 04:04:46,010
Yay!

5803
04:04:49,010 --> 04:04:50,050
Wait, what's over there?

5804
04:04:51,670 --> 04:04:52,510
Oh, I knew it.

5805
04:04:52,570 --> 04:04:53,750
I was like, there's a hole there.

5806
04:04:54,990 --> 04:04:55,930
I made it!

5807
04:05:07,520 --> 04:05:09,420
I suppose that could've been fluke.

5808
04:05:09,620 --> 04:05:11,040
Better be on the right caliber.

5809
04:05:11,160 --> 04:05:12,480
You're gonna make it through this one.

5810
04:05:13,200 --> 04:05:13,760
Alright.

5811
04:05:14,360 --> 04:05:15,340
Which one's this one?

5812
04:05:15,700 --> 04:05:15,900
Oh.

5813
04:05:16,400 --> 04:05:18,080
Presented by Mickey Mouse.

5814
04:05:18,560 --> 04:05:19,580
The Greek guns!

5815
04:05:20,660 --> 04:05:21,480
Yeah, I'm ready.

5816
04:05:23,340 --> 04:05:26,320
Congrats on passing a trial for kids.

5817
04:05:26,720 --> 04:05:28,300
Hey, I'm a kid at heart!

5818
04:05:28,680 --> 04:05:29,940
Oh my god, what the fuck?

5819
04:05:30,640 --> 04:05:31,400
Oh yeah.

5820
04:05:31,640 --> 04:05:32,860
I forgot about that.

5821
04:05:34,380 --> 04:05:35,280
Oh yeah, that's all this one.

5822
04:05:38,400 --> 04:05:39,400
Just see.

5823
04:05:39,600 --> 04:05:40,240
Why is there...

5824
04:05:40,240 --> 04:05:47,300
I forgot like, back then like, uh, we had like, shorts based off the war and shit.

5825
04:05:49,440 --> 04:05:50,640
I forgot that was a thing.

5826
04:05:52,200 --> 04:05:53,200
That was a thing.

5827
04:05:53,380 --> 04:05:54,860
Oh my god, that's a tank!

5828
04:05:55,660 --> 04:06:02,800
It was like back then, to recruit for like the World War II, like, they made Walt Disney make like propaganda films and shit.

5829
04:06:02,800 --> 04:06:02,820
Oh my god, that's it.

5830
04:06:05,420 --> 04:06:06,440
Bro, that's hardcore.

5831
04:06:07,560 --> 04:06:08,000
Yeah.

5832
04:06:08,580 --> 04:06:09,360
Give him back!

5833
04:06:09,640 --> 04:06:11,680
Give Mickey his gun back!

5834
04:06:19,720 --> 04:06:21,080
Okay, nice, we got this.

5835
04:06:24,000 --> 04:06:25,900
Never forget what Goofy did.

5836
04:06:29,320 --> 04:06:30,660
Houston, thank you for the super chat.

5837
04:06:30,760 --> 04:06:31,480
Thank you, thank you.

5838
04:06:34,320 --> 04:06:34,680
Yeah.

5839
04:06:35,620 --> 04:06:38,720
He's like, well, they're like, Walt Disney, we need propaganda films.

5840
04:06:38,840 --> 04:06:39,720
And Walt Disney's like, okay.

5841
04:06:40,600 --> 04:06:42,960
I can't come up with any witty puns for this one.

5842
04:06:42,960 --> 04:06:44,700
Just jump through the projector screen, okay?

5843
04:06:49,060 --> 04:06:52,420
Mickey did things, awful things in the war.

5844
04:06:53,060 --> 04:06:55,540
Gosh, Mickey, we gotta tell everyone.

5845
04:06:57,380 --> 04:06:59,960
I know what you did in Vietnam, Mickey.

5846
04:07:01,800 --> 04:07:06,140
Oh, Goofy, why couldn't you just look away?

5847
04:07:07,500 --> 04:07:12,080
Don't remind W on the, oh my, thank you for the super chat.

5848
04:07:12,260 --> 04:07:13,140
Thank you, thank you.

5849
04:07:18,920 --> 04:07:23,100
I totally just, that animation still lives red-free in my head.

5850
04:07:23,560 --> 04:07:26,700
The dors, Mickey, this dors here can end the war.

5851
04:07:28,540 --> 04:07:29,380
I'm sorry.

5852
04:07:30,040 --> 04:07:32,020
It's actually, it's so good.

5853
04:07:32,420 --> 04:07:33,940
Guys, you did that animation.

5854
04:07:35,720 --> 04:07:38,760
It will always live red-free in my head.

5855
04:07:45,830 --> 04:07:47,910
There has to be something here.

5856
04:07:49,790 --> 04:07:51,710
Kingdom Hearts gets wild!

5857
04:07:52,190 --> 04:07:52,210
Whoa!

5858
04:07:57,180 --> 04:07:57,660
Eh.

5859
04:07:58,260 --> 04:07:59,640
I got extra money.

5860
04:08:04,180 --> 04:08:05,960
Where am I?

5861
04:08:07,240 --> 04:08:08,540
Oh, wait, what?

5862
04:08:09,300 --> 04:08:12,540
I could fin- wait, then what's over to my right, or left?

5863
04:08:15,080 --> 04:08:18,800
I'm just gonna get all these stuff first before I...

5864
04:08:20,060 --> 04:08:21,300
Oh, hey, there's the...

5865
04:08:22,080 --> 04:08:23,040
The princess!

5866
04:08:25,100 --> 04:08:27,080
Wait, there's so many things here.

5867
04:08:30,000 --> 04:08:30,520
What?

5868
04:08:35,150 --> 04:08:36,270
Yeah, there's like...

5869
04:08:36,270 --> 04:08:37,190
I got my hot babe.

5870
04:08:40,310 --> 04:08:42,950
Yeah, but there's like more stuff though, that's the thing.

5871
04:08:43,510 --> 04:08:44,970
So I'm like, what's over there?

5872
04:08:46,090 --> 04:08:48,170
Okay, I want to look at the...

5873
04:08:48,170 --> 04:08:49,090
The side first.

5874
04:08:50,050 --> 04:08:52,430
So I open a gate here.

5875
04:08:52,610 --> 04:08:53,110
Oh, nice.

5876
04:08:54,110 --> 04:08:55,350
I did open this.

5877
04:08:56,110 --> 04:08:57,770
Oh, it was a film!

5878
04:08:57,770 --> 04:08:59,630
I missed out on the film.

5879
04:09:04,220 --> 04:09:06,460
Okay, I gotta go this way, and then...

5880
04:09:10,830 --> 04:09:11,870
Yeah, nice.

5881
04:09:13,710 --> 04:09:14,990
Give me my heart!

5882
04:09:16,030 --> 04:09:16,870
That's right!

5883
04:09:18,490 --> 04:09:19,790
That's right, baby!

5884
04:09:20,450 --> 04:09:21,470
Give me my heart!

5885
04:09:23,530 --> 04:09:24,970
Okay, and then...

5886
04:09:24,970 --> 04:09:25,890
Where does this do?

5887
04:09:27,010 --> 04:09:28,130
Okay, it's another film.

5888
04:09:31,590 --> 04:09:32,970
Oh my god, I don't want to jump off.

5889
04:09:33,070 --> 04:09:34,690
I feel like there might- I might die there.

5890
04:09:39,550 --> 04:09:40,530
Okay, we go down.

5891
04:09:43,510 --> 04:09:44,750
Yeah, I knew that was death.

5892
04:09:45,250 --> 04:09:48,170
I felt like that seemed like death right there.

5893
04:09:52,980 --> 04:09:55,960
All right, now Oswald has to see me.

5894
04:09:56,100 --> 04:09:59,420
I'm his long-lost brother that totally doesn't resent me or anything.

5895
04:10:00,320 --> 04:10:04,460
Oswald completed us in half the time, so I begrudgingly commend you.

5896
04:10:04,460 --> 04:10:10,100
The doors turned on as with our fearless leader are now open, but he will not be pleased.

5897
04:10:10,460 --> 04:10:12,640
He is the greatest hero you will ever meet.

5898
04:10:13,120 --> 04:10:13,920
Move on.

5899
04:10:14,720 --> 04:10:16,920
All right, time to meet my...

5900
04:10:16,920 --> 04:10:18,220
My hero.

5901
04:10:21,000 --> 04:10:21,800
All right.

5902
04:10:24,060 --> 04:10:27,760
Oh my god, he built himself his own little throne room and everything.

5903
04:10:29,920 --> 04:10:31,120
Hello, Oswald.

5904
04:10:31,660 --> 04:10:33,320
I'm your younger brother here.

5905
04:10:37,820 --> 04:10:39,520
His hair isn't selling.

5906
04:10:39,900 --> 04:10:42,020
I get that he resents me, but...

5907
04:10:42,020 --> 04:10:43,120
Oh gosh, you think?

5908
04:10:43,740 --> 04:10:45,120
I'm Oswald.

5909
04:10:45,960 --> 04:10:48,180
Before that, I used to be popular.

5910
04:10:48,480 --> 04:10:49,020
A star.

5911
04:10:49,180 --> 04:10:51,660
Until you stole my popularity, mouse.

5912
04:10:52,460 --> 04:10:53,360
My name is Mickey.

5913
04:10:54,040 --> 04:10:55,440
Believe me, I know.

5914
04:10:55,780 --> 04:10:58,140
Your name and likeness are on all this junk.

5915
04:10:58,400 --> 04:10:59,920
For years, I've looked at this mountain.

5916
04:11:00,180 --> 04:11:02,180
So, wondering why you all got the success I deserved.

5917
04:11:02,440 --> 04:11:04,460
For a long time, I tried to make the best of it.

5918
04:11:04,560 --> 04:11:06,720
Try to make a nice place for all the other forgotten children.

5919
04:11:07,700 --> 04:11:08,960
Especially my sweetie.

5920
04:11:09,380 --> 04:11:11,880
We're doing okay until the thinner disaster.

5921
04:11:16,140 --> 04:11:17,200
Come see, rabbit.

5922
04:11:17,460 --> 04:11:18,460
Let me clean this up.

5923
04:11:18,720 --> 04:11:20,060
The disaster unleashed the block.

5924
04:11:20,420 --> 04:11:21,080
I've been fighting.

5925
04:11:21,200 --> 04:11:21,940
Oh my god, he got...

5926
04:11:21,940 --> 04:11:22,760
They talk so fast.

5927
04:11:23,160 --> 04:11:23,660
Oh, nothing.

5928
04:11:23,800 --> 04:11:24,340
It's not...

5929
04:11:24,340 --> 04:11:25,480
I saw a screen in the house.

5930
04:11:25,520 --> 04:11:26,160
What happened to her?

5931
04:11:26,580 --> 04:11:28,760
Like you said, it's not important.

5932
04:11:29,400 --> 04:11:30,480
Why are you carrying away?

5933
04:11:30,620 --> 04:11:31,600
You always have what you need.

5934
04:11:32,040 --> 04:11:32,460
A heart?

5935
04:11:33,640 --> 04:11:35,480
Forgotten characters lose their heart.

5936
04:11:36,480 --> 04:11:37,800
No one can leave.

5937
04:11:38,440 --> 04:11:39,720
I used to have a heart.

5938
04:11:40,020 --> 04:11:41,420
Ah, so you kidnapped me!

5939
04:11:41,880 --> 04:11:43,560
Not me, the mad doctor.

5940
04:11:43,900 --> 04:11:45,100
I don't even want you here!

5941
04:11:45,420 --> 04:11:46,960
I wish you'd just get out!

5942
04:11:47,580 --> 04:11:49,900
In fact, you can still have your heart.

5943
04:11:50,540 --> 04:11:52,640
Jamar City has a Moonliner rocket.

5944
04:11:52,940 --> 04:11:54,700
We can fly it out of Wasteland.

5945
04:11:55,100 --> 04:11:56,080
Meet me in tomorrow.

5946
04:11:56,720 --> 04:11:57,780
But Oswald with a heart?

5947
04:11:58,020 --> 04:11:59,000
We can't leave.

5948
04:12:01,340 --> 04:12:02,480
What is this plan?

5949
04:12:02,860 --> 04:12:04,760
Oh my god, is this Kingdom Hearts?

5950
04:12:05,940 --> 04:12:07,860
Oh my god, they're like the Heartless!

5951
04:12:08,740 --> 04:12:11,520
Let's get back to the Mean Street to see what happened while we were away.

5952
04:12:12,160 --> 04:12:14,900
On the way, you can check with the folks here at Oswald for any news.

5953
04:12:15,120 --> 04:12:16,400
Oh my god, guys!

5954
04:12:17,280 --> 04:12:19,560
It's like they're the Heartless!

5955
04:12:19,700 --> 04:12:20,700
And I'm Sora!

5956
04:12:21,160 --> 04:12:22,840
I'm actually playing Kingdom Hearts!

5957
04:12:24,620 --> 04:12:27,480
I was playing Kingdom Hearts all along!

5958
04:12:28,780 --> 04:12:29,620
Oh yeah, here.

5959
04:12:31,040 --> 04:12:32,180
It's the prequel!

5960
04:12:32,760 --> 04:12:34,680
Thanks for connecting me to another region, Mickey!

5961
04:12:34,960 --> 04:12:36,660
Take this power spark as a reward!

5962
04:12:39,440 --> 04:12:40,080
All right.

5963
04:12:41,120 --> 04:12:41,700
You know what?

5964
04:12:41,900 --> 04:12:44,040
I think this is a good time to pause here.

5965
04:12:44,600 --> 04:12:46,440
Oh my god, this has been four hours.

5966
04:12:47,160 --> 04:12:48,320
I've been having fun though!

5967
04:12:48,700 --> 04:12:51,640
I've been enjoying Epic Mickey so far.

5968
04:12:52,420 --> 04:12:54,340
I like platformers, so...

5969
04:12:54,640 --> 04:12:57,960
It's been a long time since we played a 3D platformer.

5970
04:12:58,160 --> 04:13:01,140
So it's been a fun time, uh, enjoying it so far.

5971
04:13:01,220 --> 04:13:02,080
See you guys, I'm not...

5972
04:13:11,740 --> 04:13:13,400
He still likes me.

5973
04:13:16,100 --> 04:13:17,260
Wait, does he...

5974
04:13:19,680 --> 04:13:21,440
No consequences!

5975
04:13:31,790 --> 04:13:32,910
Consequences!

5976
04:13:37,190 --> 04:13:39,430
Tuki, murder history!

5977
04:13:39,830 --> 04:13:40,910
Tuki, stop!

5978
04:13:41,570 --> 04:13:44,610
Tuki, that's a one-stopper!

5979
04:13:47,830 --> 04:13:49,330
We can't...

5980
04:13:49,330 --> 04:13:49,970
We can't...

5981
04:13:49,970 --> 04:13:53,290
Who told her?

5982
04:13:54,970 --> 04:13:59,430
Your last platform was Patrice.

5983
04:13:59,830 --> 04:14:01,810
Thank you for the super chat.

5984
04:14:02,110 --> 04:14:03,270
Thank you, thank you.

5985
04:14:03,550 --> 04:14:05,610
The murderer on the run.

5986
04:14:06,530 --> 04:14:07,810
Oh my god!

5987
04:14:08,170 --> 04:14:09,750
I can do anything!

5988
04:14:11,330 --> 04:14:14,630
I can drive by sitting out the town.

5989
04:14:15,010 --> 04:14:16,590
No, I can't stop it!

5990
04:14:20,350 --> 04:14:21,550
Moody!

5991
04:14:21,550 --> 04:14:22,170
Where's Moody?

5992
04:14:22,650 --> 04:14:23,430
Moody!

5993
04:14:27,890 --> 04:14:30,390
Someone stop her.

5994
04:14:33,190 --> 04:14:39,590
Just like the real Mickey, she has become her true self.

5995
04:14:42,370 --> 04:14:44,350
Anyway, it's been fun so far.

5996
04:14:44,510 --> 04:14:47,650
I'm actually... in Lucia Morality.

5997
04:14:48,390 --> 04:14:51,150
I'm having a lot of fun playing Epic Mickey.

5998
04:14:51,390 --> 04:14:56,070
I think... I'm definitely gonna try and finish Epic Mickey in part 2 though, for sure.

5999
04:14:56,510 --> 04:14:57,390
In the part 2.

6000
04:14:57,470 --> 04:14:59,590
Because I'm halfway... Am I halfway, guys?

6001
04:14:59,930 --> 04:15:01,470
How far am I, in general?

6002
04:15:03,230 --> 04:15:03,710
Uh...

6003
04:15:04,710 --> 04:15:06,550
I knew... Guys, no!

6004
04:15:06,690 --> 04:15:08,190
I'm still getting the good end.

6005
04:15:08,270 --> 04:15:10,350
I just found out there's no consequences.

6006
04:15:10,990 --> 04:15:11,390
I...

6007
04:15:14,830 --> 04:15:17,650
About one third... Okay, I think we can...

6008
04:15:18,470 --> 04:15:20,850
I think we can finish it in part 2.

6009
04:15:20,950 --> 04:15:22,190
I'm pretty sure.

6010
04:15:22,810 --> 04:15:25,470
Is this game supposed to... Yeah, I mean, we're already...

6011
04:15:26,710 --> 04:15:28,510
Whoa, it's up... 12 hours?

6012
04:15:28,790 --> 04:15:30,210
Okay, maybe not in part 2.

6013
04:15:30,210 --> 04:15:31,950
Like, one, four, four, one, three.

6014
04:15:33,030 --> 04:15:33,390
Nah...

6015
04:15:34,290 --> 04:15:34,990
I don't know.

6016
04:15:35,170 --> 04:15:36,810
Do you guys think I can finish it in the second part?

6017
04:15:36,850 --> 04:15:38,090
If I do a long stream?

6018
04:15:40,690 --> 04:15:41,450
No, Scott.

6019
04:15:42,050 --> 04:15:44,010
See, maybe a part 3?

6020
04:15:45,190 --> 04:15:45,910
Okay, we'll...

6021
04:15:47,110 --> 04:15:49,070
I'm not sure you can get the gold stars.

6022
04:15:49,570 --> 04:15:49,670
No!

6023
04:15:52,150 --> 04:15:53,350
Okay, okay, we'll do it.

6024
04:15:53,470 --> 04:15:54,490
We'll finish it in part 3.

6025
04:15:54,610 --> 04:15:56,310
In part 2, we'll see how far we can get.

6026
04:15:56,550 --> 04:15:58,850
Let's see how far we can get in part 2.

6027
04:15:58,850 --> 04:16:01,670
And then part 3, we'll finish it in part 3.

6028
04:16:04,230 --> 04:16:05,470
Alright, let's do it.

6029
04:16:05,930 --> 04:16:06,370
Let's...

6030
04:16:06,370 --> 04:16:07,550
Let's save real quick.

6031
04:16:07,650 --> 04:16:08,890
I should... Can I save here?

6032
04:16:10,530 --> 04:16:11,570
Back to main menu?

6033
04:16:11,690 --> 04:16:12,590
I should be able to.

6034
04:16:13,050 --> 04:16:13,490
Yeah.

6035
04:16:13,870 --> 04:16:14,690
That was fun though.

6036
04:16:14,830 --> 04:16:15,450
I had a fun time.

6037
04:16:15,590 --> 04:16:17,210
Let's go to the chatting screen.

6038
04:16:18,790 --> 04:16:19,330
Uh...

6039
04:16:19,330 --> 04:16:19,990
Let's go here.

6040
04:16:23,790 --> 04:16:25,250
That was fun.

6041
04:16:25,370 --> 04:16:26,370
I had a lot of fun.

6042
04:16:26,890 --> 04:16:27,750
Playing it.

6043
04:16:28,250 --> 04:16:30,190
Um, I love Disney stuff so I'm glad.

6044
04:16:30,550 --> 04:16:32,210
Not the newer Disney stuff because...

6045
04:16:32,870 --> 04:16:35,890
New Disney has been, you know...

6046
04:16:35,890 --> 04:16:37,810
New Disney has fallen off a lot.

6047
04:16:37,990 --> 04:16:38,790
As we all know.

6048
04:16:41,510 --> 04:16:42,070
So...

6049
04:16:42,070 --> 04:16:42,650
Um...

6050
04:16:42,650 --> 04:16:43,370
But I do...

6051
04:16:43,370 --> 04:16:45,710
I like reminiscing about the old Disney stuff.

6052
04:16:47,250 --> 04:16:47,810
Um...

6053
04:16:47,810 --> 04:16:48,290
So...

6054
04:16:48,290 --> 04:16:48,670
It was...

6055
04:16:48,670 --> 04:16:49,490
It was really fun.

6056
04:16:49,770 --> 04:16:51,350
I had a lot of good...

6057
04:16:51,350 --> 04:16:51,650
A lot...

6058
04:16:51,650 --> 04:16:53,810
I had a really good time going...

6059
04:16:53,810 --> 04:16:54,650
Um...

6060
04:16:54,650 --> 04:16:56,330
Going through Disney things today.

6061
04:16:57,550 --> 04:16:58,970
Let me...

6062
04:16:58,970 --> 04:17:01,090
Let me grab the super chat.

6063
04:17:01,690 --> 04:17:01,910
Guys!

6064
04:17:02,370 --> 04:17:04,150
Let me grab it real quick!

6065
04:17:05,130 --> 04:17:06,610
Ba ba ba drum....

6066
04:17:07,070 --> 04:17:09,350
Ba ba ba drum...

6067
04:17:09,350 --> 04:17:11,930
Ba ba ba...

6068
04:17:14,090 --> 04:17:14,850
Hehehehehehe...

6069
04:17:16,250 --> 04:17:17,010
Uh...

6070
04:17:17,010 --> 04:17:18,610
Let's see.

6071
04:17:18,990 --> 04:17:21,330
Let me find it for us...

6072
04:17:22,030 --> 04:17:24,150
Ba ba ba da ma ba ba nam...

6073
04:17:24,150 --> 04:17:26,230
Ba ba ba diga dum...

6074
04:17:38,280 --> 04:17:39,800
It's been so long since I pulled.

6075
04:17:39,940 --> 04:17:40,340
Sorry, guys.

6076
04:17:40,520 --> 04:17:42,260
I'm just finding the superchats right now.

6077
04:17:42,520 --> 04:17:51,960
It's been a while since I've pulled up the superchat... actual superchat page for it.

6078
04:18:03,460 --> 04:18:03,780
Supers!

6079
04:18:04,560 --> 04:18:05,420
Alright, I got it.

6080
04:18:05,940 --> 04:18:08,340
I don't remember which one I've read and which one I haven't, though.

6081
04:18:08,720 --> 04:18:10,120
Because I've been all over the place.

6082
04:18:12,200 --> 04:18:13,760
Seijin, thank you for the Akasupa.

6083
04:18:14,080 --> 04:18:14,900
Thank you, thank you.

6084
04:18:15,400 --> 04:18:17,260
I don't know who made it, but they're a genius.

6085
04:18:17,500 --> 04:18:18,540
Thank you, thank you, Akasupa.

6086
04:18:18,800 --> 04:18:19,840
Oh yeah, by the way, guys.

6087
04:18:23,160 --> 04:18:24,260
Birthday merch is out.

6088
04:18:24,460 --> 04:18:27,220
So you guys having the birthday merch, this is your chance.

6089
04:18:27,220 --> 04:18:31,520
Birthday merch will end on August 4th for the pre-orders.

6090
04:18:31,820 --> 04:18:33,640
So make sure you grab them!

6091
04:18:33,860 --> 04:18:35,440
Wait, I did talk to... okay, so...

6092
04:18:35,440 --> 04:18:37,660
What I hate the most is FOMO.

6093
04:18:38,000 --> 04:18:40,220
So I did tell... I did ask...

6094
04:18:41,180 --> 04:18:44,440
Okay, I had a long argument with my manager about this.

6095
04:18:45,740 --> 04:18:48,340
But basically how the merch stuff is done.

6096
04:18:48,400 --> 04:18:50,000
Because I don't like FOMO.

6097
04:18:50,440 --> 04:18:55,360
Especially when the pre-orders are super short time.

6098
04:18:55,360 --> 04:18:59,060
Usually, like, you know, two to three weeks is when the pre-order is, like.

6099
04:18:59,400 --> 04:19:03,860
So I asked them if it was possible for the merch that's currently on the store.

6100
04:19:04,580 --> 04:19:07,600
And then, like, to...

6101
04:19:07,600 --> 04:19:13,160
When at the end, we're gonna order the items that's ordered currently.

6102
04:19:13,520 --> 04:19:16,160
And then we'll order a bulk amount.

6103
04:19:16,420 --> 04:19:19,060
Like, maybe, like, plus X amount later.

6104
04:19:19,060 --> 04:19:22,160
So we can still keep the items up on the store.

6105
04:19:22,940 --> 04:19:24,620
And for a bit longer.

6106
04:19:24,980 --> 04:19:26,300
Like, longer than a month.

6107
04:19:27,640 --> 04:19:29,060
Keep it longer than a month.

6108
04:19:29,260 --> 04:19:32,940
And then so, like, people who are still, you know, have finally...

6109
04:19:34,180 --> 04:19:36,200
Finally, you know, have enough money to buy.

6110
04:19:36,340 --> 04:19:38,580
I know, because, like, it's a lot of merch stuff, too, on the store.

6111
04:19:38,860 --> 04:19:39,420
And everything.

6112
04:19:40,260 --> 04:19:40,660
So...

6113
04:19:40,660 --> 04:19:42,340
It's not just the birthday merch.

6114
04:19:42,480 --> 04:19:45,080
But it's also for the other items that's on the store at the moment.

6115
04:19:45,520 --> 04:19:49,040
And I asked them if they could keep it so that you guys can still order it.

6116
04:19:49,080 --> 04:19:50,400
Like, in August and September.

6117
04:19:50,680 --> 04:19:53,100
Until, like, the items come in stock.

6118
04:19:53,300 --> 04:19:55,660
And then we can, like, change the pre-order stuff to, like, livestock.

6119
04:19:56,180 --> 04:19:57,720
So that, you know, like, being in...

6120
04:19:57,720 --> 04:19:58,560
Oh, it's on the store now.

6121
04:19:58,560 --> 04:19:59,520
So you can buy it.

6122
04:20:00,100 --> 04:20:01,040
If you want it to...

6123
04:20:01,040 --> 04:20:03,020
Like, you know, we have the items in the warehouse now.

6124
04:20:03,180 --> 04:20:04,760
So I did say...

6125
04:20:04,760 --> 04:20:08,180
But in that, we did say, like, if the bulk items that we ordered...

6126
04:20:08,180 --> 04:20:09,940
Are, like, already, like...

6127
04:20:09,940 --> 04:20:11,800
Are bought up by the end of, like...

6128
04:20:11,800 --> 04:20:14,020
By the time, like, the items get here.

6129
04:20:14,020 --> 04:20:16,500
Then, like, we'll see if there's interest.

6130
04:20:17,060 --> 04:20:17,780
And some...

6131
04:20:17,780 --> 04:20:19,340
Like, what are the lower interest items.

6132
04:20:19,500 --> 04:20:21,460
And what should, like, the higher interest items.

6133
04:20:21,540 --> 04:20:23,300
So, like, if there's, like, a lower interest items.

6134
04:20:23,340 --> 04:20:25,460
Maybe we'll do, like, one last pre-order or something.

6135
04:20:25,820 --> 04:20:27,920
And then, like, take it off the store after that.

6136
04:20:28,180 --> 04:20:28,860
Stuff like that.

6137
04:20:28,980 --> 04:20:32,200
So this is, like, the plans for the future of the items.

6138
04:20:32,200 --> 04:20:33,320
It's the merch and stuff.

6139
04:20:33,500 --> 04:20:34,700
Or the Doki merch.

6140
04:20:34,940 --> 04:20:37,860
Because I just want to give you guys more time to be able to...

6141
04:20:38,760 --> 04:20:42,780
I want to give you guys more time to be able to order some of these items.

6142
04:20:42,780 --> 04:20:45,600
Because, you know, we launched a lot of things at once, too.

6143
04:20:45,720 --> 04:20:50,320
So I know that, you know, you guys have to make sure to keep aware of your own finances and stuff like that.

6144
04:20:50,500 --> 04:20:52,120
So I wanted to give you guys more time.

6145
04:20:52,180 --> 04:20:58,900
If you guys really wanted something on the store but can't afford it yet and still, like, you know, need more time for it to afford it.

6146
04:20:59,220 --> 04:21:01,500
And so I was like, oh, can we keep it in the store longer?

6147
04:21:02,060 --> 04:21:06,240
Um, longer than, um, a month?

6148
04:21:06,240 --> 04:21:13,140
And they're like, yeah, we can... we're gonna... so they're planning on ordering some, like, the items in a little bit more, like, a bulk order of it.

6149
04:21:13,260 --> 04:21:20,000
So like... I don't know how many extra they're ordering, but they're ordering extra for it when, uh, the technical pre-order is done.

6150
04:21:20,360 --> 04:21:23,900
So like, those who pre-order will, you know, guarantee they get their items.

6151
04:21:24,140 --> 04:21:29,220
And then we'll have, like, extra stock for those who are ordering in August or September and stuff like that.

6152
04:21:29,560 --> 04:21:32,760
Uh, so we can still get the items in time, too.

6153
04:21:34,080 --> 04:21:36,600
But yeah, that's a little merch update.

6154
04:21:37,960 --> 04:21:39,180
Fudgetop, thank you for the super chat.

6155
04:21:39,200 --> 04:21:39,680
Thank you.

6156
04:21:39,680 --> 04:21:41,140
Have you seen Walt Disney's animatronic?

6157
04:21:41,460 --> 04:21:43,600
It's kind of controversial because of the way it looks.

6158
04:21:43,740 --> 04:21:46,320
Can't believe they used that instead of his frozen body.

6159
04:21:46,460 --> 04:21:50,680
Oh yeah, the frozen body of Walt Disney that's under Disney World, right?

6160
04:21:51,360 --> 04:21:52,440
Thank you for the super chat.

6161
04:21:52,540 --> 04:21:53,380
Thank you, thank you.

6162
04:21:55,000 --> 04:21:56,380
Jack, thank you for the super chat.

6163
04:21:56,480 --> 04:21:56,980
Thank you, thank you.

6164
04:21:57,040 --> 04:21:59,300
Did you see that video of that girl trying to do an impression of you?

6165
04:21:59,300 --> 04:22:07,240
Yeah, I saw that on my feed, on my Twitter feed, and there's... She said that my accent is like a valley girl accent.

6166
04:22:07,240 --> 04:22:09,700
I didn't even realize I sounded like a valley girl.

6167
04:22:11,320 --> 04:22:13,280
And she tried to do an impression of me.

6168
04:22:13,600 --> 04:22:17,980
I can't tell if it's accurate because her voice is a lot higher than mine.

6169
04:22:18,180 --> 04:22:26,260
So like when she was like doing an impression of mine, my accent, like the way I talk, it was a lot higher.

6170
04:22:26,540 --> 04:22:27,880
So I couldn't tell.

6171
04:22:27,880 --> 04:22:33,060
I couldn't tell if it was accurate or not because like, I don't know.

6172
04:22:34,480 --> 04:22:36,060
Because her voice is higher.

6173
04:22:36,560 --> 04:22:41,680
So like if it was pitched like my voice, then like maybe I could tell the similarities.

6174
04:22:42,180 --> 04:22:44,580
But, um, but I couldn't tell.

6175
04:22:44,820 --> 04:22:45,720
I couldn't, I don't know.

6176
04:22:45,980 --> 04:22:50,640
Because like, I don't know if she's getting my intonations or whatever.

6177
04:22:56,050 --> 04:22:59,690
Yeah, so I don't know if it's close or not because I actually can't tell.

6178
04:23:01,770 --> 04:23:04,330
But her breakdown of it was interesting.

6179
04:23:04,850 --> 04:23:07,650
I found, like, to be fair, I skimmed through the video.

6180
04:23:07,930 --> 04:23:09,350
I didn't watch the entire thing.

6181
04:23:09,450 --> 04:23:10,130
I skimmed through it.

6182
04:23:10,290 --> 04:23:15,370
But her breakdown of it was pretty interesting when she was like doing an analysis of my voice.

6183
04:23:15,370 --> 04:23:18,610
Because obviously like, you know, I don't know.

6184
04:23:19,050 --> 04:23:21,010
I don't know how my voice is like.

6185
04:23:21,710 --> 04:23:24,850
Um, I also read, I don't know, I think you guys know this.

6186
04:23:24,950 --> 04:23:31,050
But like, what you hear yourself is different from what you actually sound like to other people.

6187
04:23:31,310 --> 04:23:34,610
So I don't actually know what I sound like to other people.

6188
04:23:36,210 --> 04:23:39,430
Because what I, because like, you, you don't know what you yourself sound like.

6189
04:23:41,490 --> 04:23:43,650
Um, all right.

6190
04:23:43,930 --> 04:23:45,150
Uh, but thank you for the super chat.

6191
04:23:45,250 --> 04:23:45,770
Thank you, thank you.

6192
04:23:45,890 --> 04:23:47,050
Frass, thank you for the super chat.

6193
04:23:47,150 --> 04:23:47,730
Thank you, thank you.

6194
04:23:47,870 --> 04:23:49,610
The worst part is, I'm gonna put my hoodie down.

6195
04:23:49,930 --> 04:23:51,330
Since it's like, casual now.

6196
04:23:54,670 --> 04:23:55,230
Let's see.

6197
04:23:56,790 --> 04:24:00,170
Oh my gosh, my, the worst part is like, I don't remember which one I've read and which one I haven't.

6198
04:24:03,150 --> 04:24:04,790
Uh, next C, thank you for the super chat.

6199
04:24:04,870 --> 04:24:05,490
Thank you, thank you.

6200
04:24:05,550 --> 04:24:06,630
Your voice is very distinctive.

6201
04:24:06,790 --> 04:24:07,310
Always love to hear.

6202
04:24:07,430 --> 04:24:07,790
Thank you.

6203
04:24:07,850 --> 04:24:08,730
Thank you for the super chat.

6204
04:24:08,850 --> 04:24:09,430
Thank you, thank you.

6205
04:24:09,630 --> 04:24:09,630
Yeah.

6206
04:24:10,190 --> 04:24:11,710
Um, I'm glad.

6207
04:24:12,110 --> 04:24:12,630
I'm glad.

6208
04:24:12,750 --> 04:24:15,530
I think my voice, like I said, it's like, very...

6209
04:24:15,530 --> 04:24:18,350
Either people love my voice or people hate my voice.

6210
04:24:18,510 --> 04:24:20,050
It's like, one or the other.

6211
04:24:20,350 --> 04:24:21,430
Because like, I'm more...

6212
04:24:21,830 --> 04:24:37,170
I think it's also because like, VTubers, I think like, the status quo when it comes to VTubing is that usually, like, the typical VTuber is, like, not loud in a more, like, cutesy voice or, like, more mellow, quiet, cutesy voice.

6213
04:24:37,370 --> 04:24:44,110
So, like, I'm, like, the more of a loud mouth and stuff like that, so it's, like, I'm loud and I laugh a lot.

6214
04:24:44,370 --> 04:24:46,850
So, like, it's either you love it or you hate it.

6215
04:24:48,270 --> 04:24:53,050
It's very polarizing, which I've learned, and to accept, because you can't satisfy everybody.

6216
04:24:53,450 --> 04:24:54,110
Mm-hmm.

6217
04:24:56,790 --> 04:24:57,190
Um...

6218
04:24:58,210 --> 04:24:58,870
Let's see.

6219
04:25:00,630 --> 04:25:05,710
I'm trying to... I'm just trying to figure out which one I've read and which one I haven't, guys.

6220
04:25:05,750 --> 04:25:06,210
I'm sorry.

6221
04:25:08,210 --> 04:25:09,310
I've lost track.

6222
04:25:10,690 --> 04:25:12,090
LC, thank you for the super chat.

6223
04:25:12,190 --> 04:25:12,990
Thank you, thank you.

6224
04:25:13,070 --> 04:25:15,070
I guess that's one way to get your Groks up.

6225
04:25:15,130 --> 04:25:16,210
Oh, yeah, at Grok.

6226
04:25:16,670 --> 04:25:19,690
At my future wife, Grok.

6227
04:25:22,710 --> 04:25:25,710
Uh, Kyro, thank you for the super chat.

6228
04:25:25,790 --> 04:25:26,710
Thank you, thank you.

6229
04:25:26,930 --> 04:25:29,630
The birthday talk reminded me it's my birthday today.

6230
04:25:29,850 --> 04:25:30,210
I love it.

6231
04:25:30,290 --> 04:25:31,750
Happy birthday from my Kamiyoshi.

6232
04:25:32,050 --> 04:25:33,770
You, if it's not too much to ask, of course.

6233
04:25:34,070 --> 04:25:34,930
Happy birthday.

6234
04:25:35,470 --> 04:25:36,310
Uh, thank you for the super chat.

6235
04:25:36,390 --> 04:25:37,030
Thank you, thank you.

6236
04:25:37,210 --> 04:25:38,750
Happy birthday to you.

6237
04:25:39,070 --> 04:25:40,730
Happy birthday to you.

6238
04:25:41,050 --> 04:25:42,760
Happy birthday, dear Kyro.

6239
04:25:43,650 --> 04:25:45,370
Happy birthday to you.

6240
04:25:45,550 --> 04:25:45,890
Yeah!

6241
04:25:46,770 --> 04:25:47,490
Happy birthday!

6242
04:25:50,650 --> 04:25:52,390
Gia, thank you in the super chat, thank you, thank you.

6243
04:25:52,490 --> 04:25:54,570
That's why your songs, I believe, is hard to cover, too.

6244
04:25:54,710 --> 04:25:56,990
Because you have a unique tone that adds flavor to your song.

6245
04:25:57,150 --> 04:25:57,690
Thank you.

6246
04:25:57,830 --> 04:25:58,770
Thank you in the super chat.

6247
04:25:58,990 --> 04:25:59,830
I really appreciate it.

6248
04:25:59,870 --> 04:26:00,550
Thank you, thank you.

6249
04:26:04,770 --> 04:26:05,810
Manny, thank you in the super chat.

6250
04:26:05,930 --> 04:26:06,510
Thank you, thank you.

6251
04:26:06,570 --> 04:26:08,330
Oh my god, we are like pandas.

6252
04:26:11,390 --> 04:26:12,590
Bria, thank you in the super chat.

6253
04:26:12,690 --> 04:26:13,310
Thank you, thank you.

6254
04:26:13,390 --> 04:26:14,510
And this is how the world ends.

6255
04:26:14,650 --> 04:26:16,830
Not with a bang, but with a bragoon.

6256
04:26:18,210 --> 04:26:19,430
Peter, thank you for the super chat.

6257
04:26:19,490 --> 04:26:19,970
Thank you, thank you.

6258
04:26:20,090 --> 04:26:21,710
Did somebody say that door to darkness?

6259
04:26:22,810 --> 04:26:24,690
Um, Parappa, thank you for the super chat.

6260
04:26:24,790 --> 04:26:25,390
Thank you, thank you.

6261
04:26:25,470 --> 04:26:27,150
Your voice is always so cute.

6262
04:26:27,410 --> 04:26:28,330
Thank you for the super chat.

6263
04:26:28,470 --> 04:26:29,310
Thank you, thank you.

6264
04:26:30,570 --> 04:26:36,070
Now you're gonna realize... I haven't used my, like... I haven't done my child voice in so long.

6265
04:26:37,750 --> 04:26:38,110
Um...

6266
04:26:38,830 --> 04:26:39,190
Um...

6267
04:26:39,190 --> 04:26:43,950
I realized that, cause I was like, oh yeah, cause there's never, like, a time to use it, you know?

6268
04:26:46,430 --> 04:26:53,510
Some people, like, some people don't realize that I can be a ve- like, I- I can voice act as, like, a child.

6269
04:26:54,390 --> 04:26:57,290
Um, wait, uh, or my old man voice, yeah.

6270
04:27:01,750 --> 04:27:06,950
Wait, um, um, wait, let me see if I- let's see if...

6271
04:27:07,610 --> 04:27:08,430
Pop, wait.

6272
04:27:09,230 --> 04:27:10,090
Pop, what's me?

6273
04:27:10,670 --> 04:27:12,890
Uh, thank you for the super chat.

6274
04:27:12,890 --> 04:27:14,050
Thank you, thank you.

6275
04:27:14,950 --> 04:27:16,750
Tumblr girls first got ya.

6276
04:27:19,470 --> 04:27:20,710
Thank you for the super chat.

6277
04:27:20,870 --> 04:27:21,790
Thank you, thank you.

6278
04:27:23,330 --> 04:27:25,770
Uh, Fuzz, thank you for the super chat.

6279
04:27:25,890 --> 04:27:26,730
Thank you, thank you.

6280
04:27:27,090 --> 04:27:29,230
One day I'll catch your full stream.

6281
04:27:29,430 --> 04:27:31,850
Happy birthday and wish you and everyone here well.

6282
04:27:32,050 --> 04:27:32,750
Thank you for the super chat.

6283
04:27:32,870 --> 04:27:33,690
Thank you, thank you.

6284
04:27:33,850 --> 04:27:35,470
Oh, that's weird.

6285
04:27:37,310 --> 04:27:41,010
That's- that's- Look, that child has gone through a lot.

6286
04:27:42,230 --> 04:27:43,630
Mike, thank you for the super chat.

6287
04:27:43,750 --> 04:27:44,610
Thank you, thank you.

6288
04:27:44,770 --> 04:27:46,210
I don't remember how to do the old man.

6289
04:27:47,310 --> 04:27:47,710
Hello.

6290
04:27:52,490 --> 04:27:52,890
Mike.

6291
04:27:56,110 --> 04:28:00,610
I just think of, like, the giant, like, Mega Evolution Pikachu.

6292
04:28:01,150 --> 04:28:02,430
Is it Mega Evolution Pikachu?

6293
04:28:02,850 --> 04:28:04,850
Where, where... No, Gigantamax.

6294
04:28:04,870 --> 04:28:06,730
I think of a Gigantamax Pikachu.

6295
04:28:06,730 --> 04:28:11,110
And, you know, like, he's like, Pika.

6296
04:28:14,630 --> 04:28:15,270
Pika.

6297
04:28:17,790 --> 04:28:18,950
Gigantamax Doki.

6298
04:28:20,730 --> 04:28:21,370
Mike.

6299
04:28:24,710 --> 04:28:25,350
Cute.

6300
04:28:26,150 --> 04:28:27,730
Thank you for the super chat.

6301
04:28:27,870 --> 04:28:28,130
Thank you.

6302
04:28:28,290 --> 04:28:28,830
Thank you.

6303
04:28:31,530 --> 04:28:32,170
Pika.

6304
04:28:39,370 --> 04:28:39,730
Gak.

6305
04:28:39,730 --> 04:28:40,710
Curse, thank you for the super chat.

6306
04:28:40,810 --> 04:28:41,430
Thank you, thank you.

6307
04:28:41,550 --> 04:28:44,150
You're gonna have to play another FNAF game after Kingdom Hearts playthrough.

6308
04:28:44,870 --> 04:28:45,730
Uh, Gus, thank- Yeah.

6309
04:28:45,950 --> 04:28:48,750
I do if I want to fix the algorithm on my channels.

6310
04:28:49,170 --> 04:28:50,390
I don't know, I feel like...

6311
04:28:50,390 --> 04:28:51,270
That's what I'm saying.

6312
04:28:51,430 --> 04:29:01,230
I think Kingdom Hearts 1 was very nostalgia-filled for it, because, like, I think if I try to play Kingdom Hearts 1 again, I'm gonna go fucking crazy with the controllers and the boss fights.

6313
04:29:01,270 --> 04:29:02,790
Like, I'm not playing on Proud mode.

6314
04:29:02,970 --> 04:29:04,250
Like, that- that shit is...

6315
04:29:05,730 --> 04:29:06,670
That's just torture.

6316
04:29:06,970 --> 04:29:12,850
Like, I feel like Kingdom Hearts 1 just had so much fucking bullshit, um, that I was thrown.

6317
04:29:13,250 --> 04:29:25,750
That- I- I remember that I didn't know what the fuck to do, that I actually bought the- the guidebook, because, like, uh, Because you remember, like, back then, there were, like, little, like, tutorial guidebooks before, like, people googled the- like,

6318
04:29:25,910 --> 04:29:26,650
walkthroughs and stuff?

6319
04:29:26,870 --> 04:29:42,810
You get, like, the strategy guide, and I actually had the Kingdom Hearts 1 strategy guide, because I didn't know what the fuck to do, because, like, um, um, Kingdom Hearts 1 was, like, not self-explan- like, like, you need yellow paint.

6320
04:29:43,170 --> 04:29:48,270
Like, you- You- you actually need yellow paint for the first game.

6321
04:29:48,270 --> 04:29:57,370
Like, yeah, because I- I was, like, I was so confused on where to go, and, like, how to set up, like- like, like, start the cutscenes and stuff.

6322
04:29:59,150 --> 04:30:00,850
Um, I like Kingdom Hearts 2.

6323
04:30:01,050 --> 04:30:07,870
I replayed Kingdom- I remember, like, growing up, I replayed Kingdom Hearts 2, like, I think, like, three times, I'm pretty sure.

6324
04:30:08,290 --> 04:30:10,070
Uh, I enjoyed Kingdom Hearts 2.

6325
04:30:10,130 --> 04:30:17,850
I replayed Kingdom Hearts 1, like, once, and that was because I never- I didn't finish it the first time around, so I was, like, this time I will finish it this- now.

6326
04:30:17,950 --> 04:30:21,070
And then I never completed Kingdom Hearts 3, because that game sucked.

6327
04:30:21,470 --> 04:30:24,290
I told you guys, I got to the Frozen level, and I was, like, that's enough.

6328
04:30:24,990 --> 04:30:29,550
That's a- That's enough Kingdom Hearts for me.

6329
04:30:31,790 --> 04:30:32,650
I'm so sad.

6330
04:30:32,810 --> 04:30:35,390
I wish Kingdom Hearts 3 was a lot better.

6331
04:30:35,390 --> 04:30:38,430
I wish it was, because we waited so long, you know?

6332
04:30:39,150 --> 04:30:42,650
We- we waited so fucking long for the sequel.

6333
04:30:44,530 --> 04:30:45,970
Yeah, I've seen enough, yeah.

6334
04:30:47,730 --> 04:30:49,770
I didn't even finish the Frozen level, too.

6335
04:30:49,850 --> 04:30:50,730
I stopped halfway.

6336
04:30:51,150 --> 04:30:53,790
We were cl- I was climbing the mountain- like, I was like, we- me and Sora.

6337
04:30:57,070 --> 04:31:02,870
I was- I was climbing a mountain in the- the Frozen or whatever, and then, like, I just stopped.

6338
04:31:03,150 --> 04:31:04,670
Like, I just turned off my console.

6339
04:31:04,670 --> 04:31:08,570
Like, I- I turned off my- I- I- was it PlayStation 3 or 4?

6340
04:31:08,710 --> 04:31:10,990
I don't remember if it was on PlayStation 3 or 4.

6341
04:31:11,110 --> 04:31:13,150
I just turned it off, and I was like, that's enough.

6342
04:31:13,630 --> 04:31:15,710
I- I- I never came back to it.

6343
04:31:17,710 --> 04:31:20,070
Um, Neppers, thank you for the super chat.

6344
04:31:20,190 --> 04:31:21,070
Thank you, thank you.

6345
04:31:21,530 --> 04:31:22,910
Uh, finding a game-list?

6346
04:31:23,010 --> 04:31:24,490
That's a problem for future Doki.

6347
04:31:24,610 --> 04:31:26,110
I'm so glad I'm not her.

6348
04:31:28,610 --> 04:31:30,270
Uh, guys, thank you for the super chat.

6349
04:31:30,390 --> 04:31:30,950
Thank you- thank you.

6350
04:31:31,270 --> 04:31:33,050
Very sadly, pretend it doesn't exist.

6351
04:31:33,150 --> 04:31:35,750
Because not only is it gacha, it's a shitty cash grab gacha.

6352
04:31:35,750 --> 04:31:39,430
I'm so sad that the Madoka game was- is a gacha game.

6353
04:31:39,570 --> 04:31:47,270
I was actually willing to- I was actually willing to play a JRPG because it's Madoka.

6354
04:31:47,530 --> 04:31:50,450
I told you guys, I was fucking crazy obsessed with Madoka.

6355
04:31:50,450 --> 04:32:08,830
I even have, like, um, like, I- when I- when the movie, the, uh, the Rebellion movie came out, um, it was playing on select theaters, and I went to a movie theater and brought in a plushie of Q-bay, uh, Q-B to, like, like, um, poking out of my- my bag and everything,

6356
04:32:09,050 --> 04:32:11,950
and, like, have Q-Bs, like, sitting next to me while watching the movie.

6357
04:32:12,550 --> 04:32:20,350
Um, and I was so- I- like, I was- I had, like, I didn't even have, like, a life-size replica of- figure of Q-B and everything, too.

6358
04:32:20,350 --> 04:32:29,430
Like, I was so obsessed over Madoka, and I was- literally, I would have played a JRPG on my channel if it was an actual RPG.

6359
04:32:29,610 --> 04:32:42,390
If I- if it was an actual game game and not just a gacha game, especially if it's, like, a gacha game that's, like, that, like, locks important story elements behind it, too.

6360
04:32:42,650 --> 04:32:43,770
I'm so sad.

6361
04:32:43,770 --> 04:32:47,330
Um, let's see.

6362
04:32:48,350 --> 04:33:06,470
B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b So if you die to a boss, you have to watch the cutscene every time.

6363
04:33:06,850 --> 04:33:07,650
Thank you for the super chat.

6364
04:33:07,730 --> 04:33:08,330
Thank you, thank you.

6365
04:33:08,430 --> 04:33:10,510
Thank God you can skip cutscenes now.

6366
04:33:11,210 --> 04:33:11,530
Hello!

6367
04:33:12,010 --> 04:33:13,070
Thank you for the super chat.

6368
04:33:13,150 --> 04:33:13,950
Thank you, thank you.

6369
04:33:14,170 --> 04:33:17,030
I played every Kingdom Hearts game and also a big fan of the series too.

6370
04:33:17,150 --> 04:33:19,410
And I only understand that the big key is a key.

6371
04:33:19,650 --> 04:33:20,530
Thank you for the super chat.

6372
04:33:20,630 --> 04:33:21,510
Thank you, thank you.

6373
04:33:28,770 --> 04:33:30,290
Peter, thank you for the super chat.

6374
04:33:30,390 --> 04:33:31,130
Thank you, thank you.

6375
04:33:31,130 --> 04:33:34,710
I was half expecting Doki's Birth by Sleep video to be a Just a Pancake video.

6376
04:33:34,730 --> 04:33:36,510
I don't even remember which one I linked.

6377
04:33:36,710 --> 04:33:38,090
I don't remember who it was.

6378
04:33:38,710 --> 04:33:42,110
It's like, this is a JRPG game.

6379
04:33:42,310 --> 04:33:43,310
What role am I playing?

6380
04:33:43,390 --> 04:33:44,370
The fucking victim?

6381
04:33:45,390 --> 04:33:49,450
I love... there's like so many videos that just live rent free in my head.

6382
04:33:49,710 --> 04:33:53,130
And that's like one of... that's like... I have...

6383
04:33:55,250 --> 04:34:01,110
Right now, I have four videos that live rent free in my head that I'll always think about.

6384
04:34:01,130 --> 04:34:05,390
The first one would be... the first one would be like...

6385
04:34:05,390 --> 04:34:06,170
John Manon.

6386
04:34:07,610 --> 04:34:08,730
John Manon.

6387
04:34:09,070 --> 04:34:13,430
John... I don't know why, but always think about that video.

6388
04:34:14,070 --> 04:34:15,950
The other one is that one.

6389
04:34:16,110 --> 04:34:17,090
What role am I playing?

6390
04:34:17,210 --> 04:34:18,070
The fucking victim?

6391
04:34:19,850 --> 04:34:23,410
The third one would be Fat Yoshi's Song.

6392
04:34:24,510 --> 04:34:26,150
The... the... okay, wait.

6393
04:34:26,390 --> 04:34:29,030
For those who've never heard of the Fat Yoshi's Song...

6394
04:34:29,030 --> 04:34:30,810
The big... sorry, Big Yoshi's Song.

6395
04:34:31,130 --> 04:34:31,330
Yeah!

6396
04:34:31,990 --> 04:34:33,570
He's just... big bone.

6397
04:34:35,930 --> 04:34:36,430
Um...

6398
04:34:37,530 --> 04:34:39,290
But that video also...

6399
04:34:40,010 --> 04:34:41,130
The big Yoshi's Down.

6400
04:34:41,450 --> 04:34:43,470
That's like one of my favorite songs ever.

6401
04:34:44,290 --> 04:34:44,650
Um...

6402
04:34:44,650 --> 04:34:46,370
That lives rent free in my head as well.

6403
04:34:46,650 --> 04:34:47,410
And then...

6404
04:34:47,410 --> 04:34:48,650
The fourth one...

6405
04:34:48,650 --> 04:34:48,990
Oh my...

6406
04:34:48,990 --> 04:34:49,570
I'm starting...

6407
04:34:49,570 --> 04:34:50,970
I must have liked the video.

6408
04:34:52,050 --> 04:34:52,550
Um...

6409
04:34:52,550 --> 04:34:53,810
Let's see if I can find it.

6410
04:34:54,350 --> 04:34:55,970
I know I liked the video.

6411
04:34:56,190 --> 04:34:56,870
Because I was like...

6412
04:34:56,870 --> 04:34:58,230
One day I'll show this video.

6413
04:34:59,050 --> 04:35:00,870
One day I'll show this video.

6414
04:35:02,850 --> 04:35:03,250
Uh...

6415
04:35:03,710 --> 04:35:04,610
Where is it?

6416
04:35:04,690 --> 04:35:05,070
Is it...

6417
04:35:05,070 --> 04:35:06,110
Did I like it on Twitter?

6418
04:35:06,310 --> 04:35:07,950
Or did I...

6419
04:35:08,430 --> 04:35:09,830
Yeah, because if I'm going to show...

6420
04:35:09,830 --> 04:35:11,550
If I'm going to talk about this video...

6421
04:35:11,550 --> 04:35:13,650
I want to see if I like...

6422
04:35:13,650 --> 04:35:14,790
If I bookmarked it.

6423
04:35:29,850 --> 04:35:31,310
Okay, maybe it's three videos.

6424
04:35:31,430 --> 04:35:31,930
Because I don't...

6425
04:35:31,930 --> 04:35:33,450
I don't actually remember the fourth.

6426
04:35:33,890 --> 04:35:34,230
I...

6427
04:35:38,910 --> 04:35:40,430
I don't really remember...

6428
04:35:40,430 --> 04:35:40,870
Oh my god.

6429
04:35:41,010 --> 04:35:41,310
Okay, wait.

6430
04:35:42,790 --> 04:35:43,230
Um...

6431
04:35:43,230 --> 04:35:43,530
Okay.

6432
04:35:43,530 --> 04:35:45,550
I was looking through my Twitter bookmarks.

6433
04:35:45,690 --> 04:35:46,810
Because I was like...

6434
04:35:46,810 --> 04:35:47,190
Um...

6435
04:35:47,190 --> 04:35:48,470
Things I need to show...

6436
04:35:48,470 --> 04:35:49,110
My chat.

6437
04:35:51,510 --> 04:35:52,030
Dumb...

6438
04:35:52,030 --> 04:35:52,590
Like...

6439
04:35:52,590 --> 04:35:53,650
Dumb shit...

6440
04:35:53,650 --> 04:35:55,910
That pops up on my...

6441
04:35:55,910 --> 04:35:56,750
Um...

6442
04:35:56,750 --> 04:35:57,930
On my Twitter feed.

6443
04:35:58,030 --> 04:35:59,370
That I have to show chat.

6444
04:35:59,930 --> 04:36:00,450
But...

6445
04:36:00,450 --> 04:36:01,230
And I found...

6446
04:36:01,230 --> 04:36:02,050
And I saw...

6447
04:36:02,050 --> 04:36:03,550
Like it was bookmarked on my Twitter.

6448
04:36:03,730 --> 04:36:04,390
Because I was like...

6449
04:36:04,390 --> 04:36:05,650
Remember to show this.

6450
04:36:06,330 --> 04:36:07,610
It's really stupid.

6451
04:36:07,970 --> 04:36:08,490
But...

6452
04:36:08,490 --> 04:36:08,930
Uh...

6453
04:36:19,510 --> 04:36:21,390
Let's go watch the Minecraft movie.

6454
04:36:21,650 --> 04:36:22,590
Like real men.

6455
04:36:22,830 --> 04:36:24,270
I'm going with my girlfriend.

6456
04:36:24,890 --> 04:36:25,410
Um...

6457
04:36:25,410 --> 04:36:27,830
Did your girlfriend pay for the server we used to play on?

6458
04:36:27,990 --> 04:36:31,050
Did your girlfriend pick up your items when you died?

6459
04:36:31,370 --> 04:36:34,650
Did your girlfriend build the automatic iron farm?

6460
04:36:34,650 --> 04:36:37,030
Don't ever speak to me again.

6461
04:36:42,410 --> 04:36:42,810
Me...

6462
04:36:43,210 --> 04:36:44,870
How dare you?

6463
04:36:45,350 --> 04:36:45,770
Me...

6464
04:36:45,770 --> 04:36:47,470
You're not a real homie.

6465
04:36:47,950 --> 04:36:49,970
I'm your girlfriend, bro.

6466
04:36:50,830 --> 04:36:52,910
I'm your girlfriend, bro.

6467
04:36:53,690 --> 04:36:54,490
Dang...

6468
04:36:54,490 --> 04:36:56,510
Man just lost a homie.

6469
04:37:01,210 --> 04:37:02,810
I love that screenshot.

6470
04:37:03,090 --> 04:37:04,490
It's so fucking good.

6471
04:37:06,390 --> 04:37:06,790
Um...

6472
04:37:07,610 --> 04:37:08,010
Um...

6473
04:37:08,010 --> 04:37:08,090
Um...

6474
04:37:08,090 --> 04:37:08,350
Oh my god.

6475
04:37:08,390 --> 04:37:10,810
There's so many things I like saved on my bookmarks.

6476
04:37:10,810 --> 04:37:12,210
I forgot to tell you guys about.

6477
04:37:12,970 --> 04:37:13,370
Um...

6478
04:37:13,370 --> 04:37:14,510
I want to do this one day.

6479
04:37:14,730 --> 04:37:15,670
I want to do this.

6480
04:37:15,770 --> 04:37:16,370
Where like...

6481
04:37:16,370 --> 04:37:19,010
If we ever get a Dragoon plushie...

6482
04:37:19,430 --> 04:37:21,530
If we ever get a Dragoon plushie...

6483
04:37:21,530 --> 04:37:22,810
Like an official one made.

6484
04:37:22,950 --> 04:37:23,810
I want to do this.

6485
04:37:24,010 --> 04:37:24,350
Where...

6486
04:37:24,350 --> 04:37:25,610
Basically...

6487
04:37:25,610 --> 04:37:27,890
This video is basically where...

6488
04:37:27,890 --> 04:37:29,870
If he doesn't get a gacha...

6489
04:37:29,870 --> 04:37:31,510
Or like the thing he wants...

6490
04:37:31,510 --> 04:37:32,410
He starts to cut...

6491
04:37:32,410 --> 04:37:33,630
Every piece of Luigi.

6492
04:37:33,890 --> 04:37:35,250
Like slowly cut...

6493
04:37:35,250 --> 04:37:36,670
Piece by piece...

6494
04:37:36,670 --> 04:37:37,590
Of Luigi.

6495
04:37:38,550 --> 04:37:40,890
And he doesn't get his pull.

6496
04:37:41,170 --> 04:37:42,570
And I want to do...

6497
04:37:45,250 --> 04:37:46,390
And I get...

6498
04:37:46,390 --> 04:37:48,550
The official Dragoon plushie.

6499
04:37:48,730 --> 04:37:49,970
And I'll be like...

6500
04:37:49,970 --> 04:37:52,310
Today I'm going to open this.

6501
04:37:52,770 --> 04:37:53,490
Why?

6502
04:37:56,350 --> 04:37:58,150
Wait a second.

6503
04:37:58,990 --> 04:38:01,250
There has to be a punishment.

6504
04:38:01,710 --> 04:38:02,430
I...

6505
04:38:04,770 --> 04:38:05,930
One day.

6506
04:38:06,270 --> 04:38:07,470
If I ever get...

6507
04:38:07,470 --> 04:38:08,570
We ever...

6508
04:38:08,570 --> 04:38:09,250
Whenever...

6509
04:38:09,250 --> 04:38:09,790
Okay, not if.

6510
04:38:10,290 --> 04:38:11,010
Whenever...

6511
04:38:11,010 --> 04:38:14,630
We get an official Dragoon plushie.

6512
04:38:15,950 --> 04:38:17,610
Something's wrong with you.

6513
04:38:17,610 --> 04:38:19,350
The only time you...

6514
04:38:19,350 --> 04:38:20,570
Now you guys can't...

6515
04:38:20,570 --> 04:38:23,330
I love how he like starts taping him up.

6516
04:38:23,550 --> 04:38:25,370
It's actually crazy.

6517
04:38:26,270 --> 04:38:27,030
It's...

6518
04:38:27,910 --> 04:38:28,670
Um...

6519
04:38:28,670 --> 04:38:29,210
And they're like...

6520
04:38:29,210 --> 04:38:30,570
Here's Dragoon 3.0.

6521
04:38:31,750 --> 04:38:33,310
That's messed up.

6522
04:38:33,770 --> 04:38:35,530
I think it's a great idea.

6523
04:38:35,970 --> 04:38:36,450
I...

6524
04:38:37,090 --> 04:38:37,650
No...

6525
04:38:37,650 --> 04:38:37,690
Why?

6526
04:38:39,250 --> 04:38:42,550
Because I know you guys are gonna wish bad luck to me.

6527
04:38:42,670 --> 04:38:44,630
And I'm teaching you all a lesson.

6528
04:38:44,630 --> 04:38:46,610
You have to give me your gotcha luck.

6529
04:38:46,610 --> 04:38:48,890
Let's see.

6530
04:38:50,210 --> 04:38:50,910
Uh...

6531
04:38:50,910 --> 04:38:58,180

04:39:22,740 --> 04:39:25,980
bu Like, the Epic Mickey concept art was actually so fucked up.

6534
04:39:26,500 --> 04:39:28,620
Like... Like, it was crazy.

6535
04:39:31,520 --> 04:39:37,160
Um... Okay, this is like... Okay, I'm gonna tell you right now, disclaimer, it's like, really...

6536
04:39:37,880 --> 04:39:38,400
HAHAHAHA!

6537
04:39:38,580 --> 04:39:39,400
It's crazy!

6538
04:39:39,840 --> 04:39:44,660
It's basically like... Okay, guys, remember like, the fucked up concept stuff from- concept art from Pokemon?

6539
04:39:45,100 --> 04:39:46,960
It's basically like that.

6540
04:39:47,940 --> 04:39:52,720
But like, this were like... This was like the rejected concept art.

6541
04:39:52,720 --> 04:39:54,440
For Epic Mickey.

6542
04:39:54,720 --> 04:39:56,180
When it comes to the enemies.

6543
04:39:56,360 --> 04:40:00,860
Like, some of the enemies that you can encounter in- in Epic Mickey.

6544
04:40:01,000 --> 04:40:02,080
And I'm like, what the fuck?

6545
04:40:02,700 --> 04:40:03,080
HAHAHAHA!

6546
04:40:03,480 --> 04:40:05,160
This is a children's game!

6547
04:40:06,340 --> 04:40:06,780
HAHAHAHA!

6548
04:40:07,140 --> 04:40:09,060
Like, excuse me?

6549
04:40:11,120 --> 04:40:12,420
Um... And there's more.

6550
04:40:12,580 --> 04:40:13,460
There's more, by the way.

6551
04:40:13,700 --> 04:40:15,820
This was... There's more.

6552
04:40:16,000 --> 04:40:19,060
They made... There is a... There- Oh my god.

6553
04:40:19,160 --> 04:40:19,840
Look at this one.

6554
04:40:22,720 --> 04:40:23,960
Look at... Look at this.

6555
04:40:24,140 --> 04:40:24,980
The centipede.

6556
04:40:25,180 --> 04:40:26,340
Oh my god.

6557
04:40:26,420 --> 04:40:28,520
That... We were robbed!

6558
04:40:29,120 --> 04:40:31,780
I... I can't... Guys, I think I can see why these are cut.

6559
04:40:32,140 --> 04:40:32,300
Alright.

6560
04:40:33,220 --> 04:40:33,580
HAHAHAHA!

6561
04:40:33,960 --> 04:40:38,460
Bro, it reminds me of the... Of Alice in Wonderland game.

6562
04:40:38,580 --> 04:40:41,560
The madness... Uh... American McGee's Alice in Wonderland.

6563
04:40:41,560 --> 04:40:43,080
That's what it reminds me of.

6564
04:40:43,180 --> 04:40:48,540
The Mickey Centipede with Abraham Lincoln as the... HAHAHAHA!

6565
04:40:48,940 --> 04:40:55,060
The fact that Abraham Lincoln is on the head of the fucking centipede.

6566
04:40:55,220 --> 04:40:57,440
Like, what... What is this?

6567
04:40:57,640 --> 04:41:00,280
Get that ogget out of my screen.

6568
04:41:00,580 --> 04:41:01,020
Why?

6569
04:41:01,200 --> 04:41:04,500
Because it's like the pre- like the president's room or some shit.

6570
04:41:05,020 --> 04:41:06,980
Like, I... HAHAHAHA!

6571
04:41:08,220 --> 04:41:09,260
Jesus Christ.

6572
04:41:09,960 --> 04:41:14,260
But yeah, no, like, the... The con... The concept of art for Epic Mickey...

6573
04:41:14,260 --> 04:41:18,920
I think they... I'm pretty sure they wanted to do, like, an actual, like, horror game.

6574
04:41:19,160 --> 04:41:23,860
Uh... Like, an actual horror, horror game of Epic Mickey before they pivoted or something.

6575
04:41:24,120 --> 04:41:28,480
Because, like... I... Why was that a thing?

6576
04:41:28,920 --> 04:41:31,320
Why... Why did they do this?

6577
04:41:33,400 --> 04:41:37,040
Paper Ham Lincoln did not die for this.

6578
04:41:37,600 --> 04:41:38,200
HAHAHAHA!

6579
04:41:38,240 --> 04:41:40,060
I didn't... HAHAHAHA!

6580
04:41:42,540 --> 04:41:44,560
Uh... Was there anything... Anymore?

6581
04:41:44,840 --> 04:41:49,760
I literally googled, like, Epic Mickey concept art and, like, some of the shit is insane, actually.

6582
04:41:51,720 --> 04:41:54,460
Uh... I played American McGee's Alice before.

6583
04:41:54,740 --> 04:41:55,160
I have.

6584
04:41:55,720 --> 04:41:57,180
Um... And the sequels.

6585
04:41:57,320 --> 04:41:59,500
Did I play the sequel as well?

6586
04:41:59,700 --> 04:42:00,740
I did, right?

6587
04:42:00,740 --> 04:42:01,800
I did.

6588
04:42:02,060 --> 04:42:02,700
I remember.

6589
04:42:03,360 --> 04:42:03,760
Yeah.

6590
04:42:04,420 --> 04:42:04,900
Did I?

6591
04:42:05,120 --> 04:42:06,080
Yeah, no, I did.

6592
04:42:06,320 --> 04:42:06,700
I did.

6593
04:42:06,760 --> 04:42:10,060
I played the original and I played the sequel to it.

6594
04:42:10,800 --> 04:42:12,380
Um... It's been a long time.

6595
04:42:12,520 --> 04:42:15,900
I actually really liked American McGee's Alice and the sequel.

6596
04:42:16,940 --> 04:42:19,940
Um... It was, uh... It's one of my favorite series.

6597
04:42:21,180 --> 04:42:22,820
Uh... GGG, thank you for the super chat.

6598
04:42:22,940 --> 04:42:23,740
Thank you, thank you.

6599
04:42:23,980 --> 04:42:25,920
I'm not getting sleep now.

6600
04:42:27,280 --> 04:42:29,560
Yeah, it's actually... It's one of my favorite games.

6601
04:42:32,260 --> 04:42:34,220
I really liked the lore behind it.

6602
04:42:38,900 --> 04:42:39,700
Let's see...

6603
04:42:42,180 --> 04:42:42,580
Uh...

6604
04:42:43,120 --> 04:42:43,520
Uh...

6605
04:42:47,080 --> 04:42:49,060
Uh... Gamer, thank you for the super chat.

6606
04:42:49,160 --> 04:42:49,820
Thank you, thank you.

6607
04:42:49,900 --> 04:42:53,620
I played this when it first came out on Wii and was happy when it got remastered.

6608
04:42:53,620 --> 04:42:57,000
I'd say my only complaint is some things don't carry over in your game plus.

6609
04:42:57,320 --> 04:42:57,900
Excellent game otherwise.

6610
04:42:58,120 --> 04:42:58,880
Hope you enjoy it.

6611
04:42:58,960 --> 04:42:59,340
I did.

6612
04:42:59,560 --> 04:42:59,940
I did.

6613
04:43:00,060 --> 04:43:01,240
I can't wait to finish it.

6614
04:43:02,660 --> 04:43:03,060
Um...

6615
04:43:03,060 --> 04:43:05,540
I'm wondering... No, I was gonna say do I do two parts next week?

6616
04:43:05,680 --> 04:43:07,140
But I wanna...

6617
04:43:07,140 --> 04:43:09,880
Try and get as much Elden Ring done as possible.

6618
04:43:10,380 --> 04:43:13,080
Uh... Because I know that that game is gonna take me fucking forever.

6619
04:43:13,080 --> 04:43:13,940
Ha ha!

6620
04:43:14,560 --> 04:43:14,640
Ha!

6621
04:43:14,740 --> 04:43:15,620
Thank you for the super chat.

6622
04:43:15,720 --> 04:43:16,480
Thank you, thank you.

6623
04:43:16,740 --> 04:43:17,820
Yeah, uh...

6624
04:43:17,820 --> 04:43:18,820
Pup pup pup pup pup pup.

6625
04:43:21,320 --> 04:43:21,920
Let's see.

6626
04:43:22,500 --> 04:43:22,820
Uh...

6627
04:43:22,820 --> 04:43:22,940
All right.

6628
04:43:23,040 --> 04:43:23,860
Thank you for the super chat.

6629
04:43:23,940 --> 04:43:24,720
Thank you, thank you.

6630
04:43:25,380 --> 04:43:27,900
Uh... Mickey Mouse is surprisingly talented for a...

6631
04:43:27,900 --> 04:43:28,440
Rodent.

6632
04:43:30,220 --> 04:43:31,020
Uh... Fudge Top.

6633
04:43:31,120 --> 04:43:31,940
Thank you for the super chat.

6634
04:43:31,940 --> 04:43:32,240
Thank you.

6635
04:43:32,340 --> 04:43:32,820
Thank you.

6636
04:43:33,120 --> 04:43:33,960
Simple minded.

6637
04:43:34,120 --> 04:43:34,940
Thank you for the super chat.

6638
04:43:35,040 --> 04:43:35,260
Thank you.

6639
04:43:35,280 --> 04:43:35,660
Thank you.

6640
04:43:35,700 --> 04:43:36,800
Remember last time, Doki?

6641
04:43:37,120 --> 04:43:37,760
Beer o'clock.

6642
04:43:39,780 --> 04:43:41,480
Peter, thank you for the super chat.

6643
04:43:41,600 --> 04:43:41,820
Thank you.

6644
04:43:41,920 --> 04:43:42,420
Thank you.

6645
04:43:42,500 --> 04:43:49,360
It never ceased to amuse me that Epic Mickey is the brainchild of Warren Spector, the lead develop on Destiny X, Thief, and System Shock.

6646
04:43:49,480 --> 04:43:53,300
Oh, that makes a lot of sense how we got fucked up Mickey in those concept art then.

6647
04:43:55,920 --> 04:44:00,840
That actually makes a lot of sense now.

6648
04:44:04,980 --> 04:44:07,440
Um, if you think about it, because... Yeah.

6649
04:44:08,860 --> 04:44:09,180
Uh...

6650
04:44:09,180 --> 04:44:10,660
With the stuff he's done?

6651
04:44:10,840 --> 04:44:11,380
Oh, yeah.

6652
04:44:18,100 --> 04:44:18,740
Hey, guys.

6653
04:44:19,380 --> 04:44:20,240
Thank you for the super chat.

6654
04:44:20,300 --> 04:44:21,000
Oh, I already read that.

6655
04:44:21,100 --> 04:44:21,940
Thank you for the super chat, though.

6656
04:44:22,060 --> 04:44:22,280
Thank you.

6657
04:44:22,380 --> 04:44:22,820
Thank you.

6658
04:44:33,640 --> 04:44:34,960
Chris, thank you for the super chat.

6659
04:44:35,060 --> 04:44:35,240
Thank you.

6660
04:44:35,380 --> 04:44:35,660
Thank you.

6661
04:44:35,740 --> 04:44:39,160
Never forget that Kingdom Hearts King Mickey banished Pete to a different dimension.

6662
04:44:39,620 --> 04:44:41,660
Pete should have just said, oopsie-doopsie.

6663
04:44:41,900 --> 04:44:45,940
You should have wrote in his, like, little book and be like, I'm sorry.

6664
04:44:46,340 --> 04:44:50,420
I did a really bad thing, but I didn't mean it.

6665
04:44:50,420 --> 04:45:00,880
I love that little lore from, um, Kingdom Hearts 1 that Disney originally didn't want Mickey to be in Kingdom Hearts at all.

6666
04:45:01,000 --> 04:45:04,260
Because they're like, we don't want you to taint the mark, Mickey Mouse.

6667
04:45:04,580 --> 04:45:10,440
And then they just, like, they're like, but that's why he's, like, he's only there as, like, the shadow form of himself.

6668
04:45:10,720 --> 04:45:14,760
Because they're like, this is the only time we'll ever let you use Mickey Mouse in Kingdom Hearts.

6669
04:45:14,760 --> 04:45:17,940
Because they didn't know if the game was going to be good or not.

6670
04:45:18,040 --> 04:45:18,840
So they were scared.

6671
04:45:19,020 --> 04:45:25,360
They're like, oh, what if, what if it, they're like, oh, what if something, like, you know, what if the game tanks or stuff?

6672
04:45:25,840 --> 04:45:28,920
Um, so that's why you only see, like, he comes in at the last moment.

6673
04:45:29,200 --> 04:45:30,800
Where he just be like, uh-huh.

6674
04:45:31,040 --> 04:45:31,780
Oh, hey, everyone.

6675
04:45:31,980 --> 04:45:32,680
Don't worry, Riku.

6676
04:45:32,920 --> 04:45:35,200
I'm gonna, I'm gonna save you, Riku.

6677
04:45:36,680 --> 04:45:38,000
Don't worry, little anime boy.

6678
04:45:40,260 --> 04:45:43,060
Yeah, we'll let Goofy and Donald take the fall.

6679
04:45:45,600 --> 04:45:47,660
Um, King, thank you for the super chat.

6680
04:45:47,760 --> 04:45:48,640
Thank you, thank you.

6681
04:45:48,840 --> 04:45:53,020
The last good Disney game was Mickey Mousecapades on an NES in 1987.

6682
04:45:53,160 --> 04:45:55,360
Mickey Mousecapades, I never played that.

6683
04:45:55,560 --> 04:45:56,760
To be fair, it's on an NES.

6684
04:45:56,940 --> 04:45:57,300
Oh, yeah.

6685
04:45:57,440 --> 04:45:58,040
Wait, I...

6686
04:45:59,640 --> 04:46:01,340
Okay, no, I have played this.

6687
04:46:01,460 --> 04:46:03,480
And the reason why I played this...

6688
04:46:03,480 --> 04:46:05,020
Okay, those can relate.

6689
04:46:06,120 --> 04:46:06,380
Okay.

6690
04:46:06,380 --> 04:46:14,940
The people, you got, the ones that can relate to this are those with Asian parents slash grandparents.

6691
04:46:15,520 --> 04:46:21,440
And you have a handheld console, like, you know, like a Game Boy or Game Boy Advance.

6692
04:46:21,860 --> 04:46:29,160
Or, like, and then your grandparents or your parents would be like, Hey, look, I bought you a new game.

6693
04:46:29,160 --> 04:46:32,320
And look, it has a hundred games in one cartridge.

6694
04:46:32,600 --> 04:46:34,040
And you're like, what?

6695
04:46:34,360 --> 04:46:35,600
A hundred games?

6696
04:46:35,600 --> 04:46:37,020
So, how is that possible?

6697
04:46:39,260 --> 04:46:45,180
And back when you're younger, you didn't realize that bootlegs existed back then.

6698
04:46:45,320 --> 04:46:46,700
And you're like, wow, Mom.

6699
04:46:47,080 --> 04:46:48,000
Wow, Grandma.

6700
04:46:48,220 --> 04:46:49,420
That's so cool.

6701
04:46:50,040 --> 04:46:51,160
A hundred games?

6702
04:46:54,760 --> 04:46:55,740
Oh, boy.

6703
04:46:57,540 --> 04:46:58,060
Oh, boy.

6704
04:46:58,060 --> 04:46:58,740
Or in the...

6705
04:46:58,740 --> 04:46:59,040
Oh, really?

6706
04:46:59,480 --> 04:47:00,860
Like, like, Latin Households, too.

6707
04:47:01,320 --> 04:47:01,840
And...

6708
04:47:02,960 --> 04:47:03,480
So...

6709
04:47:03,480 --> 04:47:06,160
It was magic, you know?

6710
04:47:06,440 --> 04:47:07,280
You're like, wow!

6711
04:47:07,500 --> 04:47:10,320
And I remember the Mickey Mousecapades.

6712
04:47:10,460 --> 04:47:13,900
Because that was one of those games that was on, I think, the Game Boy.

6713
04:47:14,200 --> 04:47:16,220
With the 101 game.

6714
04:47:16,220 --> 04:47:19,520
Yeah, the good old memories.

6715
04:47:20,240 --> 04:47:20,360
Yeah.

6716
04:47:24,480 --> 04:47:28,120
But I didn't know that it was, like, bootleg.

6717
04:47:28,280 --> 04:47:29,060
Okay, so...

6718
04:47:29,360 --> 04:47:31,940
That was actually my first encounter.

6719
04:47:32,820 --> 04:47:33,620
With...

6720
04:47:33,620 --> 04:47:35,240
Like, um...

6721
04:47:35,640 --> 04:47:38,720
That was my first time experiencing Pokemon.

6722
04:47:39,760 --> 04:47:40,340
Um...

6723
04:47:40,340 --> 04:47:43,720
Because I would say my first time playing a Pokemon game was Pokemon Crystal.

6724
04:47:44,880 --> 04:47:45,460
Um...

6725
04:47:45,460 --> 04:47:46,800
But the thing is...

6726
04:47:46,800 --> 04:47:51,660
That was my first time experiencing a non-bootleg Pokemon game.

6727
04:47:52,540 --> 04:47:53,120
Because...

6728
04:47:53,120 --> 04:47:56,360
My grandma would buy me, like...

6729
04:47:56,360 --> 04:47:59,160
A bootleg version of Pokemon games.

6730
04:47:59,560 --> 04:48:01,180
And so, like...

6731
04:48:02,140 --> 04:48:02,720
Um...

6732
04:48:02,720 --> 04:48:03,820
So, like...

6733
04:48:03,820 --> 04:48:07,220
But there will be, like, in those, like, you know, 101 games.

6734
04:48:07,220 --> 04:48:09,800
So, there will be, like, Pokemon Yellow and Red.

6735
04:48:09,980 --> 04:48:10,080
And...

6736
04:48:10,080 --> 04:48:10,860
But then, like...

6737
04:48:10,860 --> 04:48:12,440
The thing about those games...

6738
04:48:12,880 --> 04:48:13,600
Is that...

6739
04:48:13,600 --> 04:48:14,640
You can't save.

6740
04:48:17,820 --> 04:48:18,780
That's the thing.

6741
04:48:19,000 --> 04:48:21,220
You can't actually save...

6742
04:48:21,840 --> 04:48:23,000
In those games.

6743
04:48:23,400 --> 04:48:25,440
So, like, every time I would be, like...

6744
04:48:25,440 --> 04:48:27,160
Oh, let me try out this...

6745
04:48:27,160 --> 04:48:28,860
Let me try Pokemon Yellow.

6746
04:48:28,860 --> 04:48:30,820
It would go back from the beginning.

6747
04:48:30,980 --> 04:48:33,020
So, I never was able to, like...

6748
04:48:33,020 --> 04:48:36,080
And then it would be in, like, Chinese or Japanese.

6749
04:48:36,080 --> 04:48:39,260
So, I didn't really know how to play the game, either.

6750
04:48:39,460 --> 04:48:40,480
Because it'd be...

6751
04:48:40,480 --> 04:48:42,200
It'd be in a different language.

6752
04:48:42,500 --> 04:48:43,740
And I thought...

6753
04:48:43,740 --> 04:48:44,080
I just...

6754
04:48:44,080 --> 04:48:44,940
I kept thinking, like...

6755
04:48:44,940 --> 04:48:46,120
Oh, maybe I just clicked...

6756
04:48:46,120 --> 04:48:46,800
I just didn't know...

6757
04:48:46,800 --> 04:48:48,200
I didn't know how to read it.

6758
04:48:48,200 --> 04:48:49,320
So, I don't know how to save.

6759
04:48:49,600 --> 04:48:50,020
But...

6760
04:48:50,020 --> 04:48:51,500
In the end, it just...

6761
04:48:51,500 --> 04:48:52,900
Those games just can't save.

6762
04:48:53,840 --> 04:48:55,140
Because they're not legit.

6763
04:48:55,860 --> 04:48:56,300
But...

6764
04:48:56,300 --> 04:48:57,660
My first real game...

6765
04:48:57,660 --> 04:48:58,840
Playing the real version...

6766
04:48:58,840 --> 04:49:00,060
Was Pokemon Crystal.

6767
04:49:00,060 --> 04:49:03,400
When I finally got a real edition of the game.

6768
04:49:05,060 --> 04:49:05,460
Uh...

6769
04:49:05,460 --> 04:49:05,820
Solid Snake.

6770
04:49:05,960 --> 04:49:06,840
Thank you for the super chat.

6771
04:49:06,980 --> 04:49:07,240
Thank you.

6772
04:49:07,380 --> 04:49:07,960
Thank you.

6773
04:49:08,280 --> 04:49:09,920
Legit console is so good...

6774
04:49:09,920 --> 04:49:11,460
That it cost a short circuit...

6775
04:49:11,460 --> 04:49:13,320
That made the whole neighborhood have no power.

6776
04:49:13,460 --> 04:49:15,220
People full of Latin American shenanigans.

6777
04:49:15,440 --> 04:49:16,360
Thank you for the super chat.

6778
04:49:16,500 --> 04:49:16,800
Thank you.

6779
04:49:16,940 --> 04:49:17,900
Thank you.

6780
04:49:21,160 --> 04:49:21,520
Thank you.

6781
04:49:22,000 --> 04:49:22,360
Um...

6782
04:49:22,740 --> 04:49:23,260
But yeah.

6783
04:49:23,500 --> 04:49:24,440
I got the Pokemon Yellow.

6784
04:49:24,520 --> 04:49:25,220
And I never...

6785
04:49:25,220 --> 04:49:26,520
I could never progress...

6786
04:49:26,520 --> 04:49:27,480
Past, like...

6787
04:49:27,480 --> 04:49:28,420
The first town.

6788
04:49:28,680 --> 04:49:30,700
Because I could never save the game.

6789
04:49:31,180 --> 04:49:31,540
And...

6790
04:49:36,600 --> 04:49:36,960
Yeah.

6791
04:49:37,200 --> 04:49:37,780
If you had...

6792
04:49:37,780 --> 04:49:37,940
Yeah.

6793
04:49:38,040 --> 04:49:40,320
You couldn't save in the bootleg versions.

6794
04:49:40,360 --> 04:49:41,440
Like the one that has, like...

6795
04:49:41,440 --> 04:49:41,880
101.

6796
04:49:45,580 --> 04:49:46,800
Sonic, thank you for the super chat.

6797
04:49:46,900 --> 04:49:47,080
Thank you.

6798
04:49:47,200 --> 04:49:47,700
Thank you.

6799
04:49:48,460 --> 04:49:48,820
Uh...

6800
04:49:48,820 --> 04:49:49,740
If you're thinking of the super chat.

6801
04:49:49,840 --> 04:49:50,040
Thank you.

6802
04:49:50,140 --> 04:49:50,580
Thank you.

6803
04:49:50,580 --> 04:49:50,720
Yeah.

6804
04:49:52,540 --> 04:49:54,940
Bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom.

6805
04:49:55,520 --> 04:49:57,080
Bottom, bottom, bottom.

6806
04:49:58,020 --> 04:49:58,580
Um...

6807
04:49:58,580 --> 04:49:58,820
I...

6808
04:49:58,820 --> 04:49:59,640
The Iris...

6809
04:49:59,640 --> 04:50:00,160
Uh...

6810
04:50:00,160 --> 04:50:00,900
Thank you for the super chat.

6811
04:50:01,000 --> 04:50:01,200
Thank you.

6812
04:50:01,260 --> 04:50:01,540
Thank you.

6813
04:50:01,600 --> 04:50:02,340
That game looks fun.

6814
04:50:02,400 --> 04:50:03,960
I wonder why Disney stopped making...

6815
04:50:03,960 --> 04:50:04,520
Games.

6816
04:50:04,600 --> 04:50:05,520
It's just not profitable.

6817
04:50:06,000 --> 04:50:07,080
I'm pretty sure.

6818
04:50:07,440 --> 04:50:08,300
I mean...

6819
04:50:08,300 --> 04:50:08,660
If...

6820
04:50:08,660 --> 04:50:09,980
For Disney...

6821
04:50:09,980 --> 04:50:11,400
They do make games.

6822
04:50:11,440 --> 04:50:12,580
But it's just like...

6823
04:50:15,480 --> 04:50:16,500
What's the word?

6824
04:50:17,440 --> 04:50:18,000
Uh...

6825
04:50:18,000 --> 04:50:18,920
Microtransactions.

6826
04:50:19,260 --> 04:50:20,660
They don't make actual games.

6827
04:50:20,660 --> 04:50:21,340
Games anymore.

6828
04:50:21,580 --> 04:50:24,640
They just want to do games where you have to do microtransactions.

6829
04:50:25,080 --> 04:50:25,460
Yeah.

6830
04:50:26,140 --> 04:50:27,540
Microtransaction and gacha games.

6831
04:50:28,480 --> 04:50:28,900
Yeah.

6832
04:50:29,180 --> 04:50:31,160
They don't make like actual games anymore.

6833
04:50:31,340 --> 04:50:32,700
Because to them, it's just not profitable.

6834
04:50:33,000 --> 04:50:35,240
With the amount of like years they have to put into it.

6835
04:50:36,100 --> 04:50:38,460
And they're here for like fast profit.

6836
04:50:38,660 --> 04:50:40,100
Not like long-term profit.

6837
04:50:40,220 --> 04:50:41,140
Like not fast profit.

6838
04:50:41,240 --> 04:50:42,800
Not here to make like actual like...

6839
04:50:42,800 --> 04:50:43,240
You know...

6840
04:50:43,240 --> 04:50:44,940
A good art form or something.

6841
04:50:45,760 --> 04:50:46,040
Yeah.

6842
04:50:47,620 --> 04:50:49,020
Like there's so many like...

6843
04:50:49,440 --> 04:50:51,280
Phone games that Disney makes.

6844
04:50:51,400 --> 04:50:53,820
That always plays on like YouTube ads.

6845
04:50:54,060 --> 04:50:54,980
Or like...

6846
04:50:54,980 --> 04:50:55,820
Um...

6847
04:50:55,820 --> 04:50:57,040
Like YouTube ads.

6848
04:50:57,280 --> 04:50:57,960
Or ads.

6849
04:50:58,300 --> 04:50:58,740
And...

6850
04:50:58,740 --> 04:50:59,220
What else?

6851
04:50:59,880 --> 04:51:00,600
I don't know.

6852
04:51:00,700 --> 04:51:03,060
But I always see ads for like the one with the...

6853
04:51:03,060 --> 04:51:04,080
The puzzle ones.

6854
04:51:04,280 --> 04:51:05,400
I don't remember what it's called.

6855
04:51:06,380 --> 04:51:06,820
Um...

6856
04:51:06,820 --> 04:51:08,520
There was like a puzzle...

6857
04:51:08,520 --> 04:51:13,140
There was a puzzle game that keeps popping up on my ad feed.

6858
04:51:15,980 --> 04:51:16,300
Uh...

6859
04:51:16,300 --> 04:51:16,420
Scrum.

6860
04:51:16,540 --> 04:51:17,320
Thank you for the super chat.

6861
04:51:17,420 --> 04:51:17,640
Thank you.

6862
04:51:17,780 --> 04:51:18,180
Thank you.

6863
04:51:19,140 --> 04:51:19,460
Oh.

6864
04:51:19,600 --> 04:51:22,160
Like how Konami started making pachinko.

6865
04:51:22,560 --> 04:51:24,260
Because pachinko just is just more profitable.

6866
04:51:29,400 --> 04:51:29,720
Uh...

6867
04:51:29,720 --> 04:51:30,180
Hey guys.

6868
04:51:30,260 --> 04:51:31,000
Thank you for the super chat.

6869
04:51:31,120 --> 04:51:31,340
Thank you.

6870
04:51:31,480 --> 04:51:32,060
Thank you.

6871
04:51:33,260 --> 04:51:33,580
Uh...

6872
04:51:33,580 --> 04:51:33,760
Santino.

6873
04:51:33,840 --> 04:51:34,640
Thank you for the super chat.

6874
04:51:34,740 --> 04:51:34,920
Thank you.

6875
04:51:34,980 --> 04:51:35,320
Thank you.

6876
04:51:35,360 --> 04:51:35,700
Good job.

6877
04:51:35,840 --> 04:51:36,280
You did it.

6878
04:51:36,400 --> 04:51:36,560
Yay.

6879
04:51:40,980 --> 04:51:41,620
Let's see.

6880
04:51:47,100 --> 04:51:48,820
Oh, that was my last super chat.

6881
04:51:48,860 --> 04:51:49,420
I did it!

6882
04:51:49,480 --> 04:51:51,100
I did all my super chat reading!

6883
04:51:51,560 --> 04:51:52,480
Oh my god!

6884
04:51:52,680 --> 04:51:54,980
I'm so good at super chat reading now.

6885
04:51:55,320 --> 04:52:01,040
It's so nice to, like, you know, do an after stream, chatting stream again, and just, you know, hang out with you guys.

6886
04:52:01,140 --> 04:52:02,840
I finally have time to do stuff like that.

6887
04:52:02,940 --> 04:52:03,340
Hippie!

6888
04:52:03,800 --> 04:52:07,980
Um, but yeah, it sucks, though, that Disney doesn't do, like, actual games anymore.

6889
04:52:08,460 --> 04:52:13,040
Mostly just remasters to, like, you know, they're, like... I feel like remasters, they do.

6890
04:52:13,040 --> 04:52:16,840
Because they can just outsource it to a different company to do an app for them.

6891
04:52:17,020 --> 04:52:20,920
And usually, usually, you know, they have a passion for it.

6892
04:52:21,200 --> 04:52:23,760
Because, like, you know, the developers might, like... Oh, Captain!

6893
04:52:24,000 --> 04:52:24,820
Thank you for the super chat!

6894
04:52:24,900 --> 04:52:25,120
Thank you!

6895
04:52:25,240 --> 04:52:25,680
Thank you!

6896
04:52:25,960 --> 04:52:32,600
You know, developers that may remake the game or something, the remaster for it, maybe, like, it's, like, a passion for them, too.

6897
04:52:32,980 --> 04:52:40,780
And they're, like, oh, I grew up with this and I wanna... Um, I grew up with this game and, like, you know, um, I wanna remake it.

6898
04:52:40,780 --> 04:52:42,200
And it's from Disney.

6899
04:52:43,540 --> 04:52:46,900
But I mean, like, what's it called?

6900
04:52:47,260 --> 04:52:48,000
What is that called?

6901
04:52:48,140 --> 04:52:55,280
It's like how, you know, how, like, Marvel outsourced their game to NetEase.

6902
04:52:55,460 --> 04:52:57,480
And like, what was that company?

6903
04:52:57,600 --> 04:53:01,360
Which that company is making that Marvel, the Marvel fighting game too.

6904
04:53:01,680 --> 04:53:04,940
They outsource it to like these companies to make their games for them.

6905
04:53:05,140 --> 04:53:12,340
And then DC, all DC has is that stupid, like, the mobile ad story.

6906
04:53:12,500 --> 04:53:12,940
What was it?

6907
04:53:13,180 --> 04:53:16,100
The one where they have to build, like, a base or whatever.

6908
04:53:16,680 --> 04:53:30,120
Like, all DC has is that stupid, like, game where they're trying to build a base or whatever underneath the ground because of, like, some zombie apocalypse.

6909
04:53:30,360 --> 04:53:30,800
Oh my god.

6910
04:53:31,040 --> 04:53:38,540
Before I bought YouTube, before I bought, like, the YouTube premium shit, I would always get that fucking ad.

6911
04:53:38,540 --> 04:53:39,060
Yeah.

6912
04:53:41,620 --> 04:53:44,840
Never been the same after Arkham Knight, no.

6913
04:53:45,060 --> 04:53:51,460
And they, like, fucking, um, they sold out to made a VR, like, a VR game too.

6914
04:53:51,760 --> 04:53:57,540
I swear to God, I think, I think VR games are, like, was, like, a trend.

6915
04:53:57,720 --> 04:53:58,600
Like, I don't understand.

6916
04:53:58,760 --> 04:54:04,500
I feel like no one really plays VR games other than for VR chat in general or just to hang out with people.

6917
04:54:04,500 --> 04:54:13,780
Like, I feel like VR is just more better as a social hangout thing rather than, yeah, rather than, like, actual gaming gaming.

6918
04:54:14,240 --> 04:54:17,180
Um, so, it feels like, who is it for?

6919
04:54:17,400 --> 04:54:18,800
Like, um...

6920
04:54:23,160 --> 04:54:24,920
Um, some of them were good.

6921
04:54:24,920 --> 04:54:28,960
I think it was, like, like, years ago it was good.

6922
04:54:29,260 --> 04:54:36,920
Like, the OG games, like, were good, but I feel like social-wise, uh, there are...

6923
04:54:36,920 --> 04:54:40,000
It's, like, I feel like VR is more for, like, so...

6924
04:54:40,000 --> 04:54:42,740
Other than Beat Saber, I know people fucking love Beat Saber.

6925
04:54:43,240 --> 04:54:47,940
Uh, there is, like, a huge barrier, though, for VR and stuff, which I get.

6926
04:54:47,940 --> 04:54:53,460
But, uh, I heard Minecraft VR is, like, very disorienting in general, uh, for people.

6927
04:54:54,080 --> 04:54:58,940
Um, Beat Saber is fun, I would admit, though.

6928
04:54:59,240 --> 04:55:00,520
Beat Saber is really fun.

6929
04:55:00,840 --> 04:55:02,780
Anyway, guys, I'm gonna call it here.

6930
04:55:02,940 --> 04:55:07,960
I need to walk Dad tonight because, um, he needs his walkies.

6931
04:55:08,260 --> 04:55:11,940
Um, but I hope you guys had a great time hanging out with me today.

6932
04:55:12,640 --> 04:55:14,560
Um, tomorrow is Elden Ring.

6933
04:55:14,560 --> 04:55:19,440
I was thinking about, like, uh, I'll see if my CPU is okay.

6934
04:55:19,720 --> 04:55:30,160
Well, because I actually bought a CPU upgrade, but, um, the only issue is that I don't know how to install a CPU, so I have to take it to a store to have them install my CPU for me.

6935
04:55:30,320 --> 04:55:32,860
But also, my PC is very, very heavy.

6936
04:55:33,200 --> 04:55:39,280
So, um, so, so, like, um, the reason why, like, the...

6937
04:55:39,280 --> 04:55:43,460
I'm gonna see if Elden Ring still, like, stutters, but if it still stutters...

6938
04:55:43,460 --> 04:55:47,120
Because every time I did Elden Ring, um...

6939
04:55:47,120 --> 04:55:49,260
Because sometimes it stutters and sometimes it doesn't.

6940
04:55:49,360 --> 04:55:53,400
I thought I fixed it, but the last time we played Elden Ring, it still stuttered a little bit.

6941
04:55:53,680 --> 04:55:54,980
So, like, I don't know why.

6942
04:55:55,280 --> 04:55:57,000
Like, but then, like, when I...

6943
04:55:57,000 --> 04:56:01,660
The two, two, two playthroughs ago, it didn't stutter, but then it stuttered again.

6944
04:56:01,880 --> 04:56:02,640
So, like, I don't know.

6945
04:56:02,640 --> 04:56:03,260
But every time...

6946
04:56:03,260 --> 04:56:06,260
But every time it stutters, it just goes to a hundred.

6947
04:56:06,820 --> 04:56:11,020
Um, um, it goes to a hundred and stuff for a CPU.

6948
04:56:11,300 --> 04:56:13,840
So, if it stutters again, maybe I'll...

6949
04:56:13,840 --> 04:56:15,960
Maybe I'll put my upgrade in.

6950
04:56:16,100 --> 04:56:17,860
I bought the upgrade a while ago.

6951
04:56:18,260 --> 04:56:23,980
Um, I bought the upgrade, like, a month and a half ago.

6952
04:56:23,980 --> 04:56:28,780
But then I never did anything with it because it's just...

6953
04:56:28,780 --> 04:56:30,280
The PC is so heavy, guys.

6954
04:56:30,760 --> 04:56:37,980
And I have to, like, carry the PC down and get the Uber and then, like...

6955
04:56:37,980 --> 04:56:40,620
And then, like, carry the PC over.

6956
04:56:41,060 --> 04:56:43,800
Actually, no, I could ask the Uber guy to carry my PC.

6957
04:56:43,900 --> 04:56:47,960
But it's still a lot to just get it out of my room.

6958
04:56:49,780 --> 04:56:52,280
Just to get it out of my room in general.

6959
04:56:52,280 --> 04:56:54,020
But anyway, I'm gonna call it here, everybody.

6960
04:56:54,360 --> 04:56:55,200
As always, everyone.

6961
04:56:55,640 --> 04:56:57,800
Stay hydrated, posture check, get up and around.

6962
04:56:57,940 --> 04:56:58,700
Get that blood flowing.

6963
04:56:58,860 --> 04:57:00,720
And if you still for me, head to bed.

6964
04:57:00,820 --> 04:57:02,020
Because you deserve it.

6965
04:57:02,140 --> 04:57:03,340
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

6966
04:57:03,780 --> 04:57:04,520
Bye, guys.

6967
04:57:05,140 --> 04:57:05,500
Bye.
