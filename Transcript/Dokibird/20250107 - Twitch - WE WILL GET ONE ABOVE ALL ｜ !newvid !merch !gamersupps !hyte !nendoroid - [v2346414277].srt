1
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,080
Hello, everybody.

2
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,280
Hello, welcome back to the Elo Minds.

3
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,140
The Marvel Rival Minds.

4
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:06,140
As we try again to get to one above all.

5
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,060
As we go again.

6
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,200
Oh my god.

7
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:16,100
Can today be the day where we're finally free?

8
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:22,660
You guys can finally go home after camping here for so long.

9
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,340
Is it just today that day?

10
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,100
I didn't make my gamer subs yet.

11
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,440
I should actually.

12
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,940
Let me get the...

13
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,780
I should.

14
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,060
I think it's like tradition.

15
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:37,000
My body has like pavloved itself in a way where like...

16
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,640
I have to like get the gamer subs in me to be locked in.

17
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,520
Before the grind.

18
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:44,860
Oh my god.

19
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,600
Anyway, give me a sec.

20
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,400
Let me make my gamer subs real quick.

21
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,320
Before I go back to this hellhole.

22
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,400
Oh my god.

23
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,040
Alright, story time.

24
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,600
It's not much of a story.

25
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,620
It's more like confessions of an alcoholic.

26
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,500
And by alcoholic, I mean confessions of a grinder.

27
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,460
So, for those who don't follow...

28
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,540
Oops, sorry, that's my bottle of water.

29
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,960
So, I'm not an alcoholic by the way.

30
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:17,820
I'm not an alcoholic.

31
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,680
I'm something much more worse.

32
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,900
I have terminal Marvel Rivals brain rot.

33
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,820
And I feel like that might be a bit more worse than being an alcoholic.

34
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:40,460
Anyway, so, if you don't follow me on Twitter, there is a tracker site that basically tracks if you're like top 10 of whatever on Twitch.

35
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:51,220
And apparently today, I found out that I was the top 10 female streamer on Twitch during the weekend.

36
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,160
And that was... I should be very proud of that.

37
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,360
But, that weekend, all I did was just play Marvel Rivals.

38
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,460
That's all I did.

39
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,400
And it wasn't like I streamed on Twitch for three days.

40
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,840
I streamed on Twitch for like two of those three days.

41
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,260
And the thing is...

42
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,240
Because I streamed on...

43
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,500
Wait, no, it was for two days.

44
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:23,960
No, the thing is, because I streamed on Twitch for two of those three days...

45
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:29,420
I still somehow got on the leaderboards for that.

46
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,840
Because all I really did was just stream Marvel Rivals.

47
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:41,360
So, I just got publicly exposed to the world of my crippling addiction to this game.

48
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,820
Oh, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

49
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,260
Thank you, PTD.

50
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,560
Thank you for the 300 bits.

51
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,700
Thank you, thank you.

52
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,660
We're back in the mines, baby.

53
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,440
I got publicly shamed to the world of my crippling addiction to Marvel Rivals.

54
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,140
I should be so happy.

55
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,340
I mean, I am.

56
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,920
I am happy about the accomplishment.

57
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,360
But also, it's a little sad.

58
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,620
Just a little bit.

59
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,500
It's just...

60
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,540
So, here's the chart.

61
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,040
And like, I don't even go there, too.

62
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,880
That's the thing.

63
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,420
That's the other worst part.

64
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,640
It's like...

65
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,280
I don't...

66
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,120
Twitch is not my primary platform.

67
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,480
I literally have like one-eighth of my following count on Twitch.

68
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:29,900
So, like...

69
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:36,420
The fact that I made it to top 10, even though it's like one-eighth of my following count...

70
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,120
And it's just Marvel Rivals.

71
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,620
I don't know how I feel.

72
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,400
Oh, my God.

73
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,160
I'm proud, but yet I'm also like...

74
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,960
I should get help.

75
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,420
It's okay.

76
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,260
In three days, it's all gonna be over.

77
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,840
They don't know I'm from YouTube.

78
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,580
Yeah, exactly.

79
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,420
I was like...

80
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,900
I'm like, I'm on YouTube and yet somehow I was able to accomplish that.

81
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,200
Just because I have a problem.

82
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,500
Oh, my gosh.

83
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:13,740
This...

84
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,220
Is this bottle broken?

85
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,380
Oh, I might need to throw this bottle away.

86
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,220
It's leaking.

87
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,260
Oh, my God.

88
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,660
When I was trying to shake it, it's leaking.

89
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,060
So, I might have to throw this bottle...

90
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,720
Oh, I didn't...

91
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,460
Oh, I'm dumb.

92
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,340
I just didn't...

93
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,700
I didn't fucking...

94
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,640
I didn't close it properly.

95
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,320
No!

96
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,460
Anyway, I got Gamersup's drink on my fucking desk.

97
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,600
Now, I'm like cleaning it up.

98
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,140
I like twisted it a little bit.

99
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:36,840
I was like...

100
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,740
Oh, I didn't fully twist it.

101
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,520
I was like...

102
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:39,940
Oh, man.

103
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,660
Did I break it?

104
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,200
No, I just didn't fully twist it.

105
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,280
Anyway...

106
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,740
So, that's like...

107
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,020
Confessions of a Marvel Rivals grinder today.

108
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,720
Oh, thank you for the 10!

109
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,480
Get the sauce!

110
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:52,800
Thank you!

111
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,540
Thank you!

112
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:54,840
Other than that...

113
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,940
What other life update...

114
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,340
I mean, not much happened.

115
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:57,720
Other than...

116
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,220
Oh, yeah!

117
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:58,980
Funny story.

118
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,440
So, apparently...

119
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,360
So, I have a spy.

120
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,660
Well, I don't want to say a spy.

121
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,780
But like...

122
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,560
I have a friend...

123
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,620
That's like...

124
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,980
Within the Marvel Rivals pro scene.

125
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,680
And I've been like...

126
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,000
Following Marvel Rivals players.

127
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,960
Like...

128
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,000
Because I...

129
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I don't know.

130
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,200
It seems like an incredibly difficult concept for people to understand.

131
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,640
But like...

132
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,760
So, like...

133
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,060
I've been following like...

134
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,280
A bunch of Marvel Rivals players.

135
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:34,040
Because I genuinely enjoy watching really good gameplay of Marvel Rivals.

136
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,060
Like, I genuinely enjoy that.

137
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:36,820
So, like...

138
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,300
Ever since the Overwatch days...

139
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,800
I just like watching streamers who are really good at their game.

140
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,620
So, like...

141
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,840
I do that for like Apex.

142
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,780
I do that for Overwatch.

143
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,300
And I'm doing that right now for Marvel Rivals.

144
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,680
But the thing is...

145
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,860
Since it's still like a new game...

146
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,440
The pro scene is like quite new in Marvel Rivals.

147
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,360
But I can tell who's like a really good player.

148
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,160
Like, you know...

149
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,900
They're like in the tournaments and stuff like that.

150
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,880
So, I've been following their streams and stuff.

151
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,500
But they also have like a very low following count.

152
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,440
So, they can see like me following them.

153
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,280
And they freak out about it.

154
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:09,920
So, like...

155
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,200
One of my friends who's like within the scene was telling me about it.

156
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,100
And was like...

157
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,780
Wait, you follow this person?

158
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,400
You follow these people?

159
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,200
And I was like...

160
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,140
Yeah, how did you know?

161
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:19,880
And they're like...

162
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,240
Yeah, because they're freaking out.

163
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,520
Because I was like...

164
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,180
I was like...

165
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:24,600
Why?

166
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,280
I was like...

167
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,800
They're really good at their game.

168
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,380
I just...

169
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,420
I genuinely just enjoy like watching good gameplay.

170
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,140
Because I learn from it.

171
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,840
Like, it doesn't matter if they don't play support.

172
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,280
If they play a DPS player or a tank player.

173
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,140
It helps me improve my game.

174
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,120
Because I learn from how they're playing.

175
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,760
And how like a certain DPS player...

176
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,580
Like the position and like what their thoughts are.

177
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,840
Because it improves my game knowledge.

178
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,220
Seeing what they're doing.

179
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,900
So, I've been following a bunch of like Marble Rivals like pro players.

180
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,480
And like apparently some of them are freaking out.

181
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,180
Because they're like...

182
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,660
Oh my god, did you hear JokeyBird follow me?

183
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,180
I don't know why she would follow me.

184
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,040
Like...

185
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,940
They're like...

186
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,340
She's so big.

187
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,780
Like she said she's so big.

188
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,980
Like she's so famous.

189
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,440
Like I don't get why...

190
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,060
I genuinely just enjoy...

191
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,020
I don't understand.

192
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,660
I just like watching good gameplay.

193
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:17,900
Like...

194
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,580
I said...

195
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,320
I like to play Marble Rivals.

196
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,440
And I like to watch good gameplay.

197
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,100
So...

198
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:27,880
I thought that was...

199
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,260
I thought that was really funny.

200
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,920
So like...

201
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,260
They're like...

202
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,720
Oh my god, you see her following Kat?

203
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,660
Like oh my god, why does she follow me?

204
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,300
And I'm like...

205
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,100
I don't know why freaking...

206
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,840
I just like watching people be good at what they do.

207
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,640
Like...

208
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,860
And so yeah...

209
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,680
Yeah, that's basically...

210
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,840
Basically that was like silly update in life.

211
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,840
I thought it was really cute.

212
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,420
I was like...

213
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,100
Oh man, that's so silly.

214
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,480
Hey guys!

215
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,760
Before we begin...

216
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,080
We...

217
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,600
Um...

218
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,500
I finally got a four stack for the...

219
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,020
Well, I didn't get the four stack.

220
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,920
Mace got the four stack.

221
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,420
Because I was telling Mace...

222
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,740
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

223
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,540
I'm gonna have to...

224
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,420
We have literally like...

225
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,000
Um...

226
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,860
We have three days left.

227
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,680
And I was like...

228
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,400
Don't start...

229
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,280
I was like...

230
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,120
I was like...

231
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,040
Three days...

232
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,620
Three days to get 250 points.

233
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,000
I don't even know what 250 is.

234
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,220
It's a 200!

235
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:23,800
Okay.

236
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,880
So like...

237
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,840
Um...

238
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,580
So...

239
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,720
I don't even think 250 is the cut off.

240
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,980
198 is the...

241
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:33,880
Anyway...

242
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,240
I was literally like...

243
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,680
I was literally like...

244
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,000
Um...

245
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,760
I don't think we're gonna make it, Mace.

246
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,040
I think I might have to throw in the towel.

247
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,560
Because the goal is getting further and further away.

248
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,480
And I...

249
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,640
And yesterday...

250
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,280
Oh my god.

251
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,540
Technically, it was yesterday.

252
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,540
Yesterday, we went...

253
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,240
We gained technically...

254
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,000
Technically 20 plus another 20.

255
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:56,560
Because I...

256
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,220
I'm sorry, guys.

257
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:57,940
I played two more...

258
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,300
I played a few more games off stream.

259
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,620
Because I really wanted to hit 100.

260
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,360
But like...

261
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,840
I didn't want you guys to yell at me at the moment.

262
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,060
But then like...

263
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,260
Um...

264
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:07,620
Uh...

265
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,100
Wait, Mace.

266
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:09,780
Give me a sec.

267
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,220
I'm still talking to my chat.

268
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,640
Give me like five more minutes.

269
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,040
And then...

270
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,820
And then so...

271
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,140
I went to play like a couple more games.

272
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,760
Until I hit 100 points.

273
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,640
Because I was like...

274
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,740
I'm not stopping until 100.

275
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:25,820
I...

276
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,620
I was just like...

277
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,380
I can't stop until 100.

278
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,240
So I played a couple more off stream.

279
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,660
And like...

280
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,300
I knew you guys would yell at me.

281
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,220
So I'd rather do it...

282
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,300
Ask for forgiveness.

283
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,100
I'd rather just ask for forgiveness now.

284
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,460
Than...

285
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,020
Than have you yell at me yesterday.

286
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:51,510
So...

287
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,520
Because now...

288
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,060
Now like...

289
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:53,860
It happened already.

290
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,540
It's too late.

291
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,080
You can't stop it anymore.

292
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,280
It's already happened.

293
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,260
So...

294
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,680
So I just...

295
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,520
I just wanted you guys to know that.

296
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,040
Because you might be like...

297
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,720
Why are you at 101 points?

298
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,900
You stopped at 88.

299
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,380
At one point I was at 60...

300
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,980
I was back at 66 yesterday.

301
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,220
But you guys didn't know that.

302
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,260
Because I'm now at 100.

303
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:16,880
Anyway...

304
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,520
So...

305
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,560
I told Mace that.

306
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:18,940
I was like...

307
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,560
Sorry buddy.

308
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,980
I don't think I'm gonna make it to the top 500.

309
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,060
So like...

310
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:23,620
GGs.

311
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:24,760
And then Mace was like...

312
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,460
We're getting you a four stack of like...

313
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,580
Pro players.

314
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,340
And I was like...

315
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:29,780
Oh my god.

316
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,600
Wait.

317
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,400
I'm gonna get the VTuber Shroud treatment.

318
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,940
Even though I have like...

319
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,160
1 50th of his following count.

320
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,320
Oh my god.

321
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:40,960
I feel so...

322
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,080
Even though...

323
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,740
I'm like...

324
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,480
Oh my god.

325
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,300
My make a wish has finally happened.

326
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,420
My make a wish...

327
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:57,360
I get to be Shroud for the day guys.

328
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,680
I can't believe it.

329
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,760
I get to be Shroud.

330
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,800
I get to be Shroud for a day.

331
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,240
Oh my god.

332
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,740
I get to be Kayden.

333
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,860
Oh my god.

334
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,880
I'm just mad.

335
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,060
Not make a wish.

336
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:08,720
Anyway.

337
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,680
So...

338
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,540
I did tell them.

339
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,300
I was like...

340
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:12,600
Please.

341
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,080
If...

342
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,860
If it is getting too hard.

343
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,360
We can stop.

344
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,020
At any...

345
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:17,900
You guys can stop.

346
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,700
I won't stop.

347
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,100
But like...

348
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,380
You guys can leave me.

349
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,040
Like...

350
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,740
You guys...

351
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,480
If it gets too frustrating.

352
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,520
You guys can leave me.

353
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,420
I won't stop.

354
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,280
But like...

355
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,740
I don't want you guys to suffer through this.

356
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,080
So...

357
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:34,620
Um...

358
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,280
Anyway.

359
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:36,740
Anyway.

360
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:37,700
So yeah.

361
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,160
Also like...

362
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:40,500
Um...

363
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,100
Um...

364
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:41,300
Yeah.

365
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:41,820
So yeah.

366
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,140
That's basically life update.

367
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:43,640
Alright Mace.

368
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,680
You can add me now.

369
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,640
Life update.

370
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,440
So we have...

371
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,540
I believe our stack is...

372
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,500
From what Mace told me.

373
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,540
It's Mace.

374
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:52,640
Ryamazing.

375
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,080
And...

376
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,260
Super Gomez.

377
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:55,980
Oh my god.

378
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,900
Whatever his name is.

379
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,560
I know like the ending was Gomez.

380
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,540
But like...

381
00:13:59,540 --> 00:13:59,720
I mean...

382
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,020
I mean look.

383
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,820
I should have checked it out.

384
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:01,960
Yeah.

385
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:02,520
Super Gomez.

386
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:02,920
Okay.

387
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:03,840
I was gonna be like...

388
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,480
It's either...

389
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,480
It's either...

390
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,340
Uh...

391
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:08,640
Uh...

392
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,160
It was something S Gomez.

393
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,380
And I literally went...

394
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:11,860
Oh my god.

395
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,880
What if it's not Super?

396
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:13,720
Like...

397
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,760
What if it's not...

398
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,220
Anyway.

399
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,200
Uh...

400
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:16,700
Those...

401
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,500
That is our stack for today's grind session.

402
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,280
It's also why it's early today.

403
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,260
Because finally...

404
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:27,960
We got like players that wanted to play with me at a decent time.

405
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,180
It's...

406
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,800
Oh my god.

407
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,780
We finally did it.

408
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,900
We actually got like...

409
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:39,080
Players who are willing to play with me at...

410
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,700
Like...

411
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,520
At an actual NA hour.

412
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,060
Instead of waiting until like...

413
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,400
10 to 11 PM.

414
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,860
Where I get hit up and be like...

415
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:47,880
Aye.

416
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:48,760
Aye.

417
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,820
Plan Z moment.

418
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,060
It's your time.

419
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,340
The booty call.

420
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,420
It's your time to hop in.

421
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:57,940
Cyberpunk.

422
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,580
Thank you.

423
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,420
Thank you.

424
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,860
She's not gonna be done in Season 1 because of the new Celeste.

425
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,160
Oh yeah.

426
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,320
I heard they're adding a new rank.

427
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:05,260
Um...

428
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,700
New Celestio rank for it.

429
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,100
But like...

430
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,820
Why would I aim for Celestio rank when I could just be like Eternity?

431
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:10,320
Oh.

432
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,180
Thank you for the...

433
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:11,620
Uh...

434
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:11,940
Bitties.

435
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,200
Thank you.

436
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:12,720
Thank you.

437
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,120
Anomalous.

438
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,140
Thank you for the gifting and sub.

439
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:14,480
Thank you.

440
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,100
Thank you.

441
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:15,920
Anyway guys.

442
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,580
Next season I won't be like as...

443
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:19,840
Um...

444
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,060
Terminally ill.

445
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,640
I don't know how else to explain it.

446
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:24,340
But...

447
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,290
What do you mean?

448
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,210
What?

449
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:29,910
What?

450
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,230
When did I get so many messages?

451
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,550
When did they message me this?

452
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,490
Like...

453
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:40,730
What is...

454
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,130
W-Y-N?

455
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:42,690
Oh my god!

456
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,850
I got a message from Rosa!

457
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,570
What is W-Y-N?

458
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,950
What does W-Y-N mean?

459
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,450
Rosa message me.

460
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,790
When's your next...

461
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,410
The fuck does that mean?

462
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:00,750
What did she...

463
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,170
What you mean?

464
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,730
W-Y-N?

465
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,710
I don't know what that means.

466
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,230
What does W-Y-N mean?

467
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,190
Where are you now?

468
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:14,710
Oh!

469
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:16,630
Oh!

470
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:17,690
Oh my god!

471
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,050
Rosa wanted to help out too!

472
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,490
That was our...

473
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,550
That was our ticket.

474
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:25,970
Yesterday.

475
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,070
Apparently, their team won.

476
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,850
Apparently, their team won the tournament, by the way.

477
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:32,790
So like...

478
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,050
Wait!

479
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,010
What's that?

480
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:34,910
That's Kurova!

481
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,250
Alright, nevermind.

482
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:38,690
I didn't mean Rymazing.

483
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:39,750
I mean Kurova.

484
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:40,450
I guess.

485
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,970
I guess it's not Rymazing.

486
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,130
It's Kurova.

487
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:43,830
Kurova is...

488
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,250
I know Kurova is an Atom player.

489
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:45,970
I've seen...

490
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:48,970
I've seen Kurova...

491
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,270
Play Atom really well.

492
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:52,990
Yeah.

493
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,410
Sorry, JK.

494
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:55,030
I lied.

495
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,950
It's not Rymazing.

496
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:57,030
It's Kurova.

497
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:00,430
And in the end, Doki successfully pushed Rosa.

498
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,790
I did it, guys.

499
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,410
But I didn't...

500
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:05,910
I was not a home record, chat.

501
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:07,350
I...

502
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,770
A good Atom!

503
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:13,270
I'll have you know, I won 100% my Atom games yesterday.

504
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,530
Guys, I...

505
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:17,030
Apparently, okay.

506
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,350
I was rewatching my Atom games.

507
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:21,010
Because I was like, how did I do that?

508
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,110
Like, how did...

509
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:24,430
How did I win all my Atom games?

510
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,170
Because I don't play Atom that much.

511
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,330
And then, like, apparently, people...

512
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:30,170
Some people actually thought my Atom was really good.

513
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:33,270
And there was, like, this one moment where I didn't even...

514
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:36,290
Like, legitimately, people thought I intentionally did it.

515
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:37,750
So, they thought I was, like, insane.

516
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,990
Like, I was a really good Atom player for that, doing that.

517
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:42,610
And, like, I was like, oh my gosh, she's so big-brained.

518
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:49,350
So, there was this one moment where the strange went up and tried to ult me and Mantis.

519
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:52,630
And then I pressed Q instantly.

520
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:59,950
And then, because my ult, basically, was an invincibility frame for the strange's ult.

521
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:04,410
So, then people were like, oh my god, she's so fucking smart for that.

522
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,570
Like, how did...

523
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:06,930
Like, that was insane.

524
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:12,770
And then, legitimately, when that happened, I thought I was...

525
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:21,230
So, like, reflexively, I pressed Q.

526
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:24,790
Because a Luna ult would cancel out the strange ult.

527
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,870
So, I didn't even know that would work.

528
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:32,910
It was legitimately, like, reflex from playing Luna so fucking much.

529
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:39,890
So, like, I didn't know the Atom ult is, like, an invincibility frame for the strange ult.

530
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:43,130
So, like, people were like, even I didn't know you could do that.

531
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,170
That's right, I didn't know either.

532
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,590
I didn't know either.

533
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,650
Like, I... we... none of us knew.

534
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,550
Like, you didn't know, I didn't know.

535
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:55,730
We learned a new tech.

536
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,110
I basically invented a new tech right there.

537
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:02,170
I got... it was all planned out.

538
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,210
The unintentional genius.

539
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,090
That's why I was like, oh.

540
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,990
I was like, oh, hey, it worked.

541
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,470
I was like, I don't know how, but it worked.

542
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:13,910
So, I literally didn't know that.

543
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:14,990
But now I do.

544
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,290
And now you guys do too.

545
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:19,630
And people were like, wow, I learned this new tech from Toki Bird.

546
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:22,270
I learned that new tech on the spot.

547
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,050
The Atom Toki tech.

548
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:28,170
It was totally planned.

549
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:32,430
But yeah, that's basically...

550
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,530
That's basically how it went.

551
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:37,330
I don't know how this session's gonna go.

552
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:38,570
Not gonna lie.

553
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:40,290
Because, like, legit...

554
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,790
I don't know.

555
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,070
Like I said, I...

556
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:48,730
I don't know how this is gonna go.

557
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,530
It could go anywhere.

558
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:54,530
We could end up getting sniped by four other people.

559
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,650
I don't know.

560
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:00,690
I feel like they're gonna see this.

561
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:05,270
They're gonna be like, oh man, it's time to farm Toki Bird.

562
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:10,490
And then some sick fuckers are gonna...

563
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,830
Oh man, I'm just gonna say it.

564
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,290
Now the pro players are watching this right now.

565
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,490
They're like, that's such a great idea, Toki.

566
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:21,270
Let me grab three other players right now and farm you.

567
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,570
So like, I don't know.

568
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,650
Anything could happen.

569
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:34,710
Four other pro players could fucking create their own four stack and just farm me.

570
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,630
So we'll see how they get her.

571
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,390
She doesn't even go here.

572
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:42,450
She's not even a fucking Twitch streamer.

573
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,810
Let us get her out.

574
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,550
Get her out of my category.

575
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:47,990
No skins?

576
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:51,590
I will spend money in this game when Marvel Rivals sponsor me.

577
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,610
Like, don't be it.

578
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:59,310
That will be the only way you'll see me use a skin.

579
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,090
What servers do I queue?

580
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:04,190
Oh my gosh, why are you asking me that question?

581
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:10,150
Alright Toki, give us the exact servers you queue.

582
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:16,090
And also like, show your queue time up top so we know when exactly you're gonna queue up.

583
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:20,250
And also, how many people are in your stack?

584
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:24,210
These are all just general streamer questions that we ask everybody.

585
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,350
I didn't warm up too.

586
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:34,270
I'm such an optimal role model for my stack.

587
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,830
I didn't warm up, I just woke up.

588
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:42,710
I woke up, guys, I need you to know I hibernated so fucking hard after the 16 hour stream.

589
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:53,250
Like, I kept waking up at random hours because my body is like, where are we?

590
00:21:55,010 --> 00:22:00,190
My body is like, what time zones are we on anymore?

591
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:03,290
So like, I was waking up randomly on and off yesterday.

592
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:09,130
And then at around 3, I kept waking on and off until like 3 in the morning.

593
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:17,530
And then I grabbed something to eat because my body was like, alright, even though we don't know what time zones we are in, we know you're hungry.

594
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:27,430
So, because of that, and then after that, I went back to sleep.

595
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:30,230
After digesting, I went back to sleep.

596
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:34,270
And then after digest, I just fucking slept.

597
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:38,450
I just slept the entire time and I woke up at like 4pm today.

598
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,750
Oh my god, my fucking body.

599
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,730
I woke up at 4pm today.

600
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,610
So, let's hope everything will be okay.

601
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:56,510
Someone, oh yeah, I'm not modding my game because I feel like, I feel like modding.

602
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:58,350
Oh hey, Surefour is here.

603
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,650
Surefour, I swear to god, you picked Jeff.

604
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,130
I swear to fucking god.

605
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:05,990
I heard about his, I heard about his Jeff arc.

606
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,530
So like...

607
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:14,530
I heard about his, oh thank god, we have two supports already.

608
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:17,510
I heard about his flanking Jeff arc.

609
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:18,630
So...

610
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,110
Wait, I know what to play this game.

611
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,750
No, no, no you do not.

612
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:25,710
No, no, no you do not.

613
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,610
No, you do not.

614
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:30,450
I know what to play this game.

615
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,070
I know what, alright.

616
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:36,070
No, no, no, no, you do not know what you're playing this game.

617
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:42,110
Okay, I think we ban the group.

618
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:48,030
Oh, it would be awkward if it went to Black Widow.

619
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:51,130
No, everybody ban group, everybody ban group.

620
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:55,070
I'm a fan, so...

621
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,770
What the fuck?

622
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:03,450
No, what the fuck.

623
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:06,030
It's okay.

624
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:07,250
It's okay.

625
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:13,630
Okay, Jeff, come on.

626
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,710
Oh,

627
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:30,610
I'm so sad bro, why do we have four supports?

628
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:33,790
It will work, I bet it will work.

629
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,330
We're really crafting.

630
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:40,270
Alright, listen, wait, this is genius.

631
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:44,610
We have four supports, but like lowkey, we're like not even real supports.

632
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:49,570
Yeah, like yeah, your other two supports are basically DPS, so it's like, it's perfect.

633
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:55,230
Actually, the Jeff isn't that good on this map.

634
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,010
I trust her, Jeff.

635
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:03,990
If you ever die, it's Kuroba's fault, because he's supposed to be the number one Adam, and how is he not saving your life?

636
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:18,950
Alright, there we go, that's fine, that's fine, I got Black Widow off, it's fine.

637
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:23,010
Guys, he's not on Black Widow.

638
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:28,750
Guys, we have to ban him, make sure he doesn't play Black Widow.

639
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:46,270
There's a Wolverine behind you.

640
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:49,470
Wolverine low.

641
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:54,370
There's a Hulk.

642
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:58,010
Oh,

643
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:02,570
goodbye.

644
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,190
I'm backing off.

645
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,470
I don't think so, it's just me and the support.

646
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:14,550
Oh, I'm backing out.

647
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:15,590
Alright.

648
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:18,390
There's a Hulk in the center.

649
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,840
See, we didn't have to...

650
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,340
Look guys, see, we didn't have...

651
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,700
We didn't have to ban Groot, they didn't even play Groot.

652
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,360
Look at that.

653
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:42,560
They didn't even play Groot, so like, my ban would have meant nothing.

654
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,060
It would have meant nothing, guys.

655
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,560
Guys, see?

656
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,100
We saved...

657
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,720
We saved the game.

658
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:00,200
I slept somebody, I slept... Oh, he's dead anyway.

659
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,500
Yeah, yeah, I can rez too.

660
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:07,840
I'm gonna ult this.

661
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,220
I'm gonna push up.

662
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,540
I'm on Luna.

663
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:16,900
Kill Luna.

664
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,360
I killed Luna.

665
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:27,360
Oh, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear.

666
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:30,800
Alright.

667
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,680
I'm fucking... I'm trying right now.

668
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,180
Nice.

669
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,620
Oh my god, I'm looking at the lowkey here.

670
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:51,930
Iron is still half.

671
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,570
Okay, I got you.

672
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,730
I'm gonna... Oh, we capped, okay.

673
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:58,950
It's fine!

674
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,610
It's so fine!

675
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,250
They have no lamp.

676
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:10,930
Guys, it's okay, we're just getting used to the chemistry.

677
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:14,130
We're getting used to this chemistry.

678
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:15,770
It's so healthy.

679
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:20,810
Got you.

680
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:22,770
Do they have Hulk ult?

681
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,470
Oh, there it is.

682
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,270
Oh my god.

683
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:33,490
Hulk is one.

684
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:39,890
I damage boosted you, but I'm on the point.

685
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:44,250
We're really close to it, but I might die.

686
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:47,010
No!

687
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,090
Alright, it's fine.

688
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:52,610
We're just getting used to the chemistry, guys.

689
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:55,110
Everything is so new here.

690
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:57,430
It's like the honeymoon.

691
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:59,630
It's not the honeymoon phase yet.

692
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,430
We're figuring each other out.

693
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,490
When I come back, I'll...

694
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,230
If it's winnable, if it's winnable.

695
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:13,230
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.

696
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:17,150
Oh, we're alive.

697
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:22,810
Oh my god.

698
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:27,790
I'm frozen.

699
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:33,070
I have Hulk on me, I have Hulk on me.

700
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:37,590
Alright, I'm gonna rez.

701
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,190
I'm rezzing.

702
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,290
Help our Luna if you can.

703
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,490
Alright, damage boost you, Wolverine.

704
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,670
Got you.

705
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:00,470
Loki, Loki, I'm on Loki.

706
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:03,410
I'm on Hulk, I'm on Hulk.

707
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:11,010
Oh my god!

708
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:13,970
This is so chaotic!

709
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:21,770
This is so chaotic!

710
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,070
Oh my god.

711
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:31,710
This is way too chaotic.

712
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,030
Oh, left side, Iron Man.

713
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:38,750
Oh my god.

714
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,410
Mace, we can't see you, Mace, Mace!

715
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,090
I'm here, I'm with you.

716
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,050
I'm low, I'm low, I'm low.

717
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,270
I am not okay.

718
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:50,890
You have damage boost?

719
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,770
Oh, I can't get to you.

720
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,470
There's a Hulk right behind us.

721
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,730
I might be able to grab Hulk soon.

722
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:02,690
If you can keep me up.

723
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:03,510
Oh!

724
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:07,690
I can

725
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:11,760
touch point and...

726
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,560
Oh, no.

727
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,300
Oh my god.

728
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,920
That was so chaotic.

729
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,700
I didn't realize that, like, the point was...

730
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:24,880
Oh, wait.

731
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,480
Yeah, that was a fucking brawl there.

732
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,940
Holy shit.

733
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,700
That was insane.

734
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,200
Maybe we do need four supports.

735
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:39,440
Maybe we do need four supports.

736
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,920
You're right, five supports is the answer.

737
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,740
Guys, five supports is the answer.

738
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,760
Maybe you're right.

739
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,440
If we have five supports, nobody will die.

740
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,260
If we think about it.

741
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,580
I thought we could touch...

742
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,060
I thought we had people to touch the point.

743
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,300
That's why I ulted there.

744
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,280
I thought we were close enough.

745
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:00,800
See, guys?

746
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:03,620
Me, picking, banning Black Widow...

747
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,400
Helped us.

748
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,580
It worked.

749
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,300
You're losing?

750
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,760
Yeah, but the enemy team didn't pick Root!

751
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,740
That was the entire point!

752
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,500
He's low.

753
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,540
He's asleep, he's asleep, he's asleep!

754
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:33,150
Oh my god.

755
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:36,910
That's fine.

756
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:38,990
Oh my...

757
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:43,670
I think the issue is that they also have two tanks.

758
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:50,930
Like...

759
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:52,370
Like, that's...

760
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:56,330
That's also, like, a little bit of a problem.

761
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,540
Oh my god.

762
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,360
Fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear.

763
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:09,860
Fear.

764
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:19,800
It's fine.

765
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:20,840
It's fine.

766
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,320
I could be hearing so much fear.

767
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,720
So much fucking fear.

768
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:36,220
I'm just gonna damage boost our banner so he can grab ult first.

769
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,580
It's fine, we're so healthy.

770
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,060
We're so healthy.

771
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,780
We're so healthy.

772
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,880
They're low, he's one, they're low, he's one.

773
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,380
I'm rezzing.

774
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:09,670
Trying to get to help you.

775
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:12,230
I can sleep him, I can sleep him.

776
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:18,030
Oh my god.

777
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:24,690
This is so fucking stressful!

778
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:24,970
I'm gonna fall!

779
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,330
I'll try to max his ult first.

780
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,340
Jesus Christ.

781
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,680
Oh my god, I actually fell down.

782
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:51,820
Woah!

783
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,940
I have an iron fist on me?

784
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,280
I'm multi-miss.

785
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:04,040
Am I Magneto?

786
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:08,300
Iron Fist on me, Iron Fist on me.

787
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:16,980
Where?

788
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:18,660
Where?

789
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,620
Where is this?

790
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,400
Hulk low, Hulk low.

791
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:28,720
Oh my god, I'm getting chugged!

792
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,180
I can't tell where I am!

793
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,700
Please, get it off of me!

794
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:43,740
Get it fucking off of me!

795
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,640
He's asleep.

796
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,980
I hate...

797
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:59,280
I really...

798
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,920
I can't, it's just in the air!

799
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,780
He's the fist.

800
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,660
And there he goes.

801
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,500
I was trying to touch the ground for ten seconds!

802
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,600
How is that possible?

803
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,120
But what if you die, Surefour?

804
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,100
I'm all behind you, man.

805
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:33,800
I'll go in.

806
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,380
Oh my god!

807
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,120
Some good-ass tank!

808
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,360
Oh my god, he's so fucking... What do you mean?!

809
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,600
He was gonna play Jeff!

810
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,200
I don't know if I'll get to him in time.

811
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:57,620
But...

812
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,260
Alright.

813
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,080
We need help, Surefour, if we can.

814
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:07,920
Loki's one!

815
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:14,760
We don't have the entire team helping you!

816
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,700
Oh my god.

817
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,840
Jesus Christ.

818
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,300
Surefour, you're... Oh my...

819
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:37,660
Fear!

820
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,020
Fear!

821
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:38,420
Fear!

822
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:38,820
Fear!

823
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:42,720
Fear!

824
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:43,760
Fear!

825
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:44,760
So much fear!

826
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,380
Oh my god.

827
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,940
I'm ulting this for you, Mace.

828
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,760
Oh my god.

829
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,540
Surefour, get out!

830
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:04,780
You're gonna die!

831
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,000
You're gonna die!

832
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,840
I gave you so many leads, Surefour!

833
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,340
Oh no.

834
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,400
Fear.

835
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:18,600
Fear.

836
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:27,510
We're down.

837
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:29,450
Oh, yeah, I don't think we're gonna live.

838
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,510
Oh, unless...

839
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,700
There's a Bucky to our left!

840
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:42,940
I'm trying to keep you up.

841
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:43,740
Oh, no.

842
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,300
I'm sorry.

843
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,420
I'm trying to keep you up.

844
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,100
I got you.

845
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,760
I got you!

846
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,500
You can live!

847
00:38:58,860 --> 00:38:59,260
Nevermind.

848
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:02,980
Nevermind, he didn't live.

849
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:08,120
I was trying to get him to live!

850
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,460
He lived, but at what cost?

851
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,220
At what cost?

852
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,740
He fucking lived.

853
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,340
I think a first game on fucking...

854
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,300
On Mantis is very...

855
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,140
Wait, Bucky's low!

856
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:29,540
Bucky's low!

857
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:30,280
Fear!

858
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:30,780
Fear!

859
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:31,560
Fear!

860
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:32,380
Fear!

861
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,760
We're up one!

862
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:35,180
We're up one!

863
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,440
I slept Loki!

864
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:39,940
I slept Loki!

865
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:40,880
To your right.

866
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,540
I built this.

867
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:46,820
Oh.

868
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:53,700
Okay.

869
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:55,920
I'm not...

870
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,000
They grewed him well.

871
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:11,100
Okay, maybe I should have banned Groot.

872
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:21,320
How was I supposed to know he would play fucking Groot?!

873
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,620
He didn't play it in the beginning!

874
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:27,680
Groot's half.

875
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:28,200
Groot low.

876
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,120
Help!

877
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:32,260
Help!

878
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:32,840
Help our Hulk!

879
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:32,960
Hulk!

880
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:33,020
Hulk!

881
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:33,780
Oh.

882
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:41,370
Oh, this is last fight.

883
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,020
I slept Magneto!

884
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:48,540
Fear.

885
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,360
Fear.

886
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,360
Fear.

887
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:52,700
Fear.

888
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,320
No!

889
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,620
I'm trying to keep you up!

890
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:00,980
No!

891
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,340
Triforce is healing me!

892
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:08,940
No!

893
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,820
I can't respawn!

894
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:10,460
I can cocoon!

895
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,040
I can cocoon!

896
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,820
You have to live though!

897
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:30,490
Oh my god!

898
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:33,950
I have all of you guys keep living!

899
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:36,670
Save point!

900
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:37,070
Save point!

901
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:37,510
Save point!

902
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:38,950
I'm contesting!

903
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:39,370
I'm contesting!

904
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:41,750
Nice try.

905
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:41,930
Nice try.

906
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:47,570
Okay, guys.

907
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:50,060
I'm not banning Black Widow anymore.

908
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,770
She is unfortunately cursed.

909
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:04,530
Guys, it's not even fully my fault!

910
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:08,810
The Luna also banned Black Widow with me.

911
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:09,830
Look!

912
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:14,750
Luna also banned her with me.

913
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:17,450
So we are both to blame.

914
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:31,550
It's not just a me issue.

915
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:34,350
It's me and Luna.

916
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:35,090
It's...

917
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:44,130
She could have chose Groot as well, chat.

918
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:47,590
She could have chose Groot as well.

919
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:50,610
I just did it just to fuck with sureplay.

920
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:54,610
It could have flipped to Groot if we had all Groot!

921
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:00,550
I'm taking accountability!

922
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:05,550
But I'm sharing accountability with our Luna.

923
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:08,210
You're right.

924
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:09,890
Honestly, it was sureplay's fault.

925
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:15,470
If he didn't say he was going to play Black Widow, I would have banned Black Widow.

926
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:21,430
If he didn't say that, then I would have...

927
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,590
It all ties back to him.

928
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:28,890
Look, guys.

929
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:29,770
Guys!

930
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,530
But the content, though.

931
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:34,970
The content, though.

932
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:35,670
Guys.

933
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:37,490
We got...

934
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:40,310
We got...

935
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:42,810
Guys, but what about the content, though?

936
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:45,330
I know my limits.

937
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:48,130
True.

938
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:50,410
It was a good content game.

939
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:52,890
We did win, but...

940
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:55,910
We got the YouTube video.

941
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:03,390
We got the YouTube video and that's all that matters.

942
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:04,750
Now I know!

943
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:05,470
Guys!

944
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,630
Now I know to not do that.

945
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:08,510
Okay?

946
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:10,070
I now know.

947
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:16,950
I know again.

948
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:20,690
Guys, now I know again to not do it.

949
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:24,350
It takes me... I just need a reminder every day.

950
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:25,950
That's it.

951
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:30,830
As long as I get reminded every day to not do that, then it's fine.

952
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:33,790
Now I won't...

953
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:35,810
Yeah, but all the other three times.

954
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:38,290
I was reminded every time in-game.

955
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:41,950
It just needs to happen in-game...

956
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:43,550
For me to not do it.

957
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:46,090
You don't learn.

958
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:46,950
I do!

959
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:49,430
I just forget it the next day.

960
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:51,830
Because I'm like, wouldn't it be funny?

961
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:54,310
And it was funny!

962
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:56,070
Until I lost.

963
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:58,230
Until I lost and it was less funny.

964
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:00,470
But, it was so funny.

965
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:08,650
I do!

966
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:11,750
Guys, I want to be top 500, I swear!

967
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:14,490
I do!

968
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:19,630
When you have the number... I had... He was the number one player.

969
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:21,590
He was.

970
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:26,870
Guys, now... Now I'm locked in.

971
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:28,590
Guys, now I'm locked in.

972
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:31,790
I'm so locked in now.

973
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:38,170
This is it.

974
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:42,270
After a lot of going back to loot.

975
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:46,810
I'm locked in now.

976
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:48,510
Guys, I swear to god.

977
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:51,110
I swear to god, I won't troll this time.

978
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:55,630
I won't fucking troll.

979
00:46:00,610 --> 00:46:04,590
I won't fucking troll this time, I swear to god.

980
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:10,150
No, it's true!

981
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:11,610
This is it!

982
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:17,810
I'm not... Look, it's just because Surfer was on my... It was the first game, okay?

983
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:19,210
It just triggers something.

984
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:22,590
It triggers something in me to go...

985
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:27,850
It just triggers some innate trolling inside me.

986
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:35,970
I'm just... I just feel a little silly, okay?

987
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:38,390
I just feel silly.

988
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:38,490
Silly.

989
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:43,860
I just feel very silly.

990
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:48,890
Oh my god.

991
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:01,590
I can stay up here and nothing bad will happen to me.

992
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:05,830
Right?

993
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:11,110
I can stay here and nothing bad will ever happen to me.

994
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,300
Okay, I have to go down.

995
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:22,000
That's called foreshadowing!

996
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,440
Mace, you're walled off.

997
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:35,100
Guys, it's not foreshadowing and it didn't happen.

998
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:38,880
But...

999
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,300
Use a hard knock knife.

1000
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:41,440
That's us.

1001
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:43,560
What?

1002
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,320
What?!

1003
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,400
Who?!

1004
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,020
Who?!

1005
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:49,830
No!

1006
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:52,510
I was so locked in!

1007
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:53,930
Okay, now I'm locked out.

1008
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:56,370
Now I'm locked out.

1009
00:47:57,050 --> 00:48:00,550
God damn it.

1010
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:04,910
Alright, that's fine.

1011
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:07,610
I'm locked out now.

1012
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:09,670
It's over.

1013
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:14,530
The one time I'm like, yeah, let me stop trolling.

1014
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:17,270
Let me fucking stop trolling.

1015
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:18,570
I need to figure out the...

1016
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:22,410
Every time I swap from Luna to Mantis, it fucks with me so much.

1017
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:26,050
Cause like, I don't have the projectile speed in my head.

1018
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:30,950
Like, I haven't locked the projectile speed of her yet.

1019
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:33,830
It's such a weird...

1020
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:35,910
It's such a weird speed.

1021
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:40,750
Like, I feel like I have to aim in the future when I play Mantis.

1022
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:44,730
Oh wait, has someone edited my...

1023
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:46,010
Wait, do I have any mods online?

1024
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:48,350
Or are my mods asleep?

1025
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:51,250
We need to edit our squad command.

1026
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:55,110
It's pretty...

1027
00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:57,930
It's... When you transition from Luna to Mantis, it's...

1028
00:48:57,930 --> 00:48:59,810
For me, my hip brain can't...

1029
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:02,170
My brain can't like, figure it out.

1030
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:04,310
I'm supposed to mod a new mod.

1031
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:06,390
That's actually... That would be online.

1032
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:08,770
Wait, actually I was supposed to mod a new person.

1033
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:10,610
Let me check their name.

1034
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:12,930
They're like, remember to mod this person.

1035
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:15,050
And I was like, okay.

1036
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:17,630
And then three days later, whoops.

1037
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:21,470
Alright.

1038
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:24,750
SilentCroaky, you are now...

1039
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:26,450
You are now modded.

1040
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:27,510
If you're here.

1041
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:29,870
Get on that account right now.

1042
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:31,930
Get on that account.

1043
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:35,110
We have SilentCroaky now.

1044
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:39,910
So I don't know if they're actually online.

1045
00:49:40,290 --> 00:49:43,070
But if they are, fix my squad tag.

1046
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:44,670
Cause I'm not gonna do it.

1047
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:47,190
I'm not gonna do it.

1048
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:49,170
Fix it.

1049
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:53,230
Streamer doing their own...

1050
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:55,930
Guys, I didn't...

1051
00:49:55,930 --> 00:49:59,410
Guys, I am not going to short port his mod.

1052
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:01,690
He's fucking streaming, guys.

1053
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:03,990
He's streaming right now.

1054
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:13,150
She made a whole new mod because she is lazy.

1055
00:50:13,830 --> 00:50:16,870
Go to his chat and be like, edit my command for me.

1056
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:19,470
No, I'm not gonna do it.

1057
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:20,790
I'm not gonna fucking...

1058
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:25,530
I'm not gonna fucking invade his chat just for him to fix my command.

1059
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:28,910
Wait, is this a stack lobby?

1060
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:30,570
I don't know who these people are.

1061
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:33,850
I never play at these hours, so it's...

1062
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:35,630
I'm like...

1063
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:41,230
I never play at these hours, so I don't know who these people are.

1064
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:48,610
I've always been degenerate hours.

1065
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:50,030
These are new people.

1066
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:54,170
This is a whole... Yeah, this is way too early for me.

1067
00:50:54,330 --> 00:50:55,230
It's a whole new world.

1068
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:56,790
Like, who are these people?

1069
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:00,150
I'm never online at this...

1070
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:02,050
I'm online at this time, but no one's...

1071
00:51:02,050 --> 00:51:05,290
No one plays with me at this time until now.

1072
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:14,230
Guys, I've stopped banning things because I realized that I'm a detriment to the team when I start banning.

1073
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:27,970
Baron, thank you for the tier one sub.

1074
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:29,150
Thank you, thank you.

1075
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:30,910
Lassa, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

1076
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:32,710
And Tom, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

1077
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:33,630
Thank you, thank you.

1078
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:36,410
Yeah, I just...

1079
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:42,490
No, every time I'm given the responsibility to ban things, I'm like...

1080
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:44,030
I don't know.

1081
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:45,350
What do I...

1082
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:47,150
What do I play?!

1083
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:48,910
JK, I'm not.

1084
00:51:54,430 --> 00:51:55,730
It's alright, we're here.

1085
00:51:56,770 --> 00:52:00,090
I was going through like an identity crisis for like...

1086
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:01,950
For a while, so...

1087
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:04,930
Go, Rocket, so I can get blue pack, please.

1088
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:06,010
Okay.

1089
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:08,750
Alright.

1090
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:10,290
Where's Rocket?

1091
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:12,610
Oh, okay.

1092
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:13,230
That's fine.

1093
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:17,630
It's alright.

1094
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:18,910
Was Adam banned?

1095
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:19,850
Oh, I didn't notice.

1096
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:23,130
I wasn't paying attention.

1097
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:26,650
As someone that's trying to get top 500 should do.

1098
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:37,390
Alright, I'm so fucking ready.

1099
00:52:37,930 --> 00:52:39,360
I'm so ready.

1100
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:53,990
Where are they?

1101
00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:55,030
Oh, they're over there.

1102
00:52:57,150 --> 00:52:57,830
Woah.

1103
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:07,780
Oh my god, that's scary.

1104
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:14,460
I'm scared.

1105
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:23,860
I'm gonna get rid of...

1106
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:27,760
No!

1107
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:34,050
Oh my god!

1108
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,680
I'm a little scared though, playing that area.

1109
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:43,320
I have Venom on me.

1110
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:44,980
And uh, oh...

1111
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:45,540
Psylocke's asleep.

1112
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,460
Oh my god.

1113
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:53,140
He went instantly on me.

1114
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:58,160
I got died by both Psylocke and fucking Venom.

1115
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:01,060
God damn it.

1116
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:05,880
Oh shit.

1117
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,060
That's scary.

1118
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:11,480
Oh hey, I got headshot.

1119
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,480
I'm scared.

1120
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:20,040
Fear.

1121
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,140
I ult this?

1122
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,900
Oh, sorry, I thought I was ulting first.

1123
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:31,180
I thought I was ulting first!

1124
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:35,840
I thought I was first!

1125
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:40,080
Mantis is always first unless they say something.

1126
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,060
Oh no, support ults.

1127
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:48,900
What did we get out of that?

1128
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:50,240
Strange and...

1129
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:54,480
You wanna do Mantis or Luna first?

1130
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:59,300
Okay, okay.

1131
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,600
Alright.

1132
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:05,980
I just always go Mantis first!

1133
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,840
It's been a tradition for 20 years!

1134
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,560
Guys, I think they might leave me.

1135
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:28,780
There's a chance that the stack might leave.

1136
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:29,680
LOL

1137
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:36,780
Maybe.

1138
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:39,500
Just a maybe though.

1139
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,500
There might be.

1140
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,680
But it's okay.

1141
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:51,420
I know my place.

1142
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:59,080
Oops, sorry, I trolled a little bit like that.

1143
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,060
Oh my god, where is the Berserker?

1144
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:08,760
Oh my god, I was not expecting that.

1145
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:11,580
Venom's half?

1146
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,140
Oh my god.

1147
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:22,420
Okay.

1148
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,040
Alright, I'll be second.

1149
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:27,680
I know my place.

1150
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:29,160
Venom's low.

1151
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:30,980
Venoman, no passive.

1152
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:33,440
Yay!

1153
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:37,120
I learned!

1154
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:39,200
I can learn new tricks!

1155
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,140
Oh, there's a Cyberpunk!

1156
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,440
It's okay.

1157
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:47,260
It's okay.

1158
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:48,400
Okay.

1159
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:49,880
It's okay.

1160
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,220
It's okay.

1161
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:55,680
Everything is okay.

1162
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:59,340
Oh, everything is so healthy.

1163
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,080
Everything is so healthy.

1164
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:05,820
I'm slowly backing up.

1165
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:19,100
Oh, I don't have anything.

1166
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:24,920
Please.

1167
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:25,780
Please.

1168
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:27,820
Oh my god.

1169
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:29,020
He's a sleepy sleep.

1170
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:31,960
Oh my god, I'm alive!

1171
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:34,300
I lived!

1172
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:37,140
I'm so healthy.

1173
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,500
So incredibly healthy.

1174
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:44,300
Oh my god.

1175
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,720
I'm alive.

1176
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:50,760
I feel so alive.

1177
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:52,720
I feel...

1178
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:53,840
Oh my god.

1179
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:55,860
I'm so locked in.

1180
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:59,800
Why does everybody think I have one trick?

1181
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:04,040
It's just my second game of the day.

1182
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:05,860
Okay, Mantis requires more.

1183
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:07,900
I can't autopilot on Mantis.

1184
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:11,960
I can autopilot on Luna because I have a godly insane amount of hours on her.

1185
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:15,580
But like, I cannot autopilot on Mantis at all.

1186
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:23,140
A stack of the tournament team?

1187
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:25,040
That's the tournament winners?!

1188
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:25,940
Oh no.

1189
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,160
It's happened.

1190
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:30,480
They created their fourth stack to farm me.

1191
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:31,280
Why?

1192
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:32,340
Why?

1193
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:38,840
It's only my second game.

1194
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:39,680
Have mercy.

1195
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:41,480
Farm me later.

1196
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,560
Oh my god.

1197
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:49,280
I dropped down.

1198
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:49,820
I dropped down.

1199
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:54,160
Oh no.

1200
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,800
Go, go, go, go, go.

1201
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:58,880
Oh my god.

1202
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:01,580
Why can't they farm me later?

1203
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,860
Why do they have to farm me now?

1204
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,480
Give me buff for Furious.

1205
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,140
I need heals.

1206
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:13,760
Oh my god.

1207
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:17,320
Bro, she walked away from me.

1208
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:24,240
No, dude.

1209
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:26,540
I was trying to chase after the Lulu.

1210
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:30,100
What do I do?

1211
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,400
Oh my god.

1212
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:38,960
Lamps is a snotty.

1213
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:40,140
I am.

1214
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:41,680
They're like, oh, it's time.

1215
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:43,320
They made a fourth stack for her.

1216
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:43,860
It's time.

1217
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,760
We gotta get her out of this elo.

1218
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:49,440
Please.

1219
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:57,180
If you put me in this elo, I can bring more attention to Marble Rivals and not know what you want.

1220
00:59:58,580 --> 00:59:59,420
Oh no.

1221
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:02,020
Oh, I got hit there.

1222
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:09,400
Oh my god.

1223
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,660
I don't think Luna is very good here.

1224
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:15,300
Okay.

1225
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:16,100
I got one.

1226
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,640
We can probably walk in.

1227
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:21,800
I can push in with my ult.

1228
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:25,380
Alright.

1229
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:26,300
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1230
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:28,800
Oh, they have Iden.

1231
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:29,800
I'll save it for Iden.

1232
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:35,340
Look at this.

1233
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:46,940
I'm shooting Magnia.

1234
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:50,520
I'm gonna use this ult.

1235
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:50,880
I'm gonna use it.

1236
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:53,880
Fear.

1237
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:54,460
Fear.

1238
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:55,560
Fear.

1239
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:57,580
Oh my god.

1240
01:00:59,380 --> 01:00:59,900
Back, back, one.

1241
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:00,280
Back, one.

1242
01:01:02,110 --> 01:01:02,700
Oh.

1243
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:09,200
I'm on Strange.

1244
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:12,540
I'm on Mantis.

1245
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:18,200
Did you see that?

1246
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,940
Did you see him target me?

1247
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:26,520
He actually fucking targeted me.

1248
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:30,560
Did you see that?

1249
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:36,880
He could have chose anybody else.

1250
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:42,480
He could have done anybody else.

1251
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:45,900
Oh, I didn't sleep him in time.

1252
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:53,000
Oh my god.

1253
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:56,900
I might be dead though.

1254
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:01,540
I couldn't.

1255
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:03,160
I was left alone.

1256
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:08,050
Fear.

1257
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:11,870
Oh my god.

1258
01:02:13,570 --> 01:02:14,750
I followed him to late.

1259
01:02:14,850 --> 01:02:18,270
Yeah, I didn't think they were gonna fucking go.

1260
01:02:18,830 --> 01:02:22,570
I didn't think they would like fucking walk in that corner.

1261
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:26,350
Yeah, I should not have followed him.

1262
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:28,790
I should not have followed him.

1263
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:29,970
I should have fucking just ran.

1264
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:34,390
I should have ran.

1265
01:02:41,710 --> 01:02:43,510
Yeah, I know I should hit headshots more.

1266
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:47,610
I'm just so used to like... I need to like untrain my apex aim.

1267
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:53,910
Because like in apex, it's better to body shot than like center mass.

1268
01:02:54,110 --> 01:02:56,570
Because when you're aiming in apex, you have to center mass here.

1269
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:59,970
So like I'm so used to aiming like that versus like this.

1270
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:05,490
So like I really have to untrain my like my four plus years of aiming center mass.

1271
01:03:07,610 --> 01:03:08,970
That's why I'm like struggling.

1272
01:03:09,190 --> 01:03:10,330
That's why I struggle the most.

1273
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:13,270
Because I aim for body shots, not for headshots.

1274
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:16,370
But I'm trying not to.

1275
01:03:17,610 --> 01:03:19,090
I'll call it otherwise.

1276
01:03:20,270 --> 01:03:22,610
Yeah, I'm the body shot bandit.

1277
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:25,030
Apex gave me a lot of bad habits.

1278
01:03:30,870 --> 01:03:32,470
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1279
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:39,490
Oh, scary wind.

1280
01:03:41,990 --> 01:03:44,670
I'm trying to save you right now.

1281
01:03:46,850 --> 01:03:48,090
What's up?

1282
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:49,370
Okay.

1283
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:56,070
Oh my god.

1284
01:03:57,030 --> 01:03:58,410
I see you, I see you.

1285
01:04:01,210 --> 01:04:02,690
I don't...

1286
01:04:02,690 --> 01:04:03,130
Whoa!

1287
01:04:03,650 --> 01:04:04,910
I'm on point, I'm on point, I'm on point.

1288
01:04:08,090 --> 01:04:10,050
Oh my god.

1289
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:11,930
What happened?

1290
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:12,610
What?

1291
01:04:13,470 --> 01:04:15,410
I don't... what happened?

1292
01:04:17,670 --> 01:04:20,530
I don't even know what happened.

1293
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:30,970
Oh, I'm dead here.

1294
01:04:33,590 --> 01:04:35,490
We lost both supports.

1295
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:41,820
Oh my god.

1296
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:44,940
What happened in that first fight?

1297
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,740
I don't even know what happened.

1298
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:49,520
Things just blurred together.

1299
01:04:58,340 --> 01:04:59,900
Don't worry, I'm safe here.

1300
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:04,040
Oh my god.

1301
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:06,120
Bro, okay.

1302
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:07,000
Guys.

1303
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:10,420
Wait, there's a Psylocke behind me, there's a Psylocke behind me.

1304
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:15,360
Grab Psylocke, grab Psylocke, go, go, go.

1305
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:16,140
Psylocke here.

1306
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:16,640
Where's this?

1307
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:17,220
Psylocke, Psylocke, Psylocke.

1308
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:22,120
There's a... no more behind me, no more behind me.

1309
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:23,040
No more Zombie.

1310
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:27,540
Oh my god.

1311
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:31,640
I can ult after, I can ult after.

1312
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,020
Oh, I'm stuck in the air.

1313
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:40,340
Oh my god, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear.

1314
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:43,480
I did it!

1315
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:48,460
Oh my god.

1316
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,560
There's a Psylocke behind, Psylocke behind too.

1317
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:57,300
Oh my god, if you'd let me live, oh.

1318
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:05,400
Oh my god.

1319
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:10,640
That Magneto was actually chasing me, it's actually...

1320
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:12,600
It's crazy.

1321
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:14,520
Oh my god.

1322
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:18,340
This Magneto, he looked at me this entire time.

1323
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:20,560
Like, what do you want me to do?

1324
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:21,920
Holy fuck, I hate...

1325
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,440
Oh my god, this is why I'm anti-mute it.

1326
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:25,340
This is exactly why.

1327
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,940
I'm ulting this, push up with it.

1328
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,100
Tracer's low, Tracer's low.

1329
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:38,960
I'm capping point, I'm capping point.

1330
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:46,000
I'm damage boosting.

1331
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,160
I think they're respawning soon.

1332
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:02,240
Oh no.

1333
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:04,640
They have no plop, they have no plop.

1334
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:09,480
Not the will, not the will.

1335
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:10,560
Not the will.

1336
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:12,860
I got willed.

1337
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:17,340
I was in such a bad position there.

1338
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:22,960
Oh my god, I got willed!

1339
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,940
Why did I get willed?

1340
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:31,660
Oh no.

1341
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:34,400
I'm trying to save our Mag, but he's gonna die.

1342
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:42,680
Oh my god.

1343
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,080
Why is this so hard?

1344
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:50,980
I literally was in such a position that I couldn't move from the will.

1345
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:54,200
I couldn't move from the will.

1346
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,380
I couldn't...

1347
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:00,360
Oh my god.

1348
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:04,660
I got targeted so...

1349
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:10,020
Yeah, I should've moved forward.

1350
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:11,780
I should've...

1351
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:22,320
I was gonna say, what did he do?

1352
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:25,200
I was like, oh shit.

1353
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:27,960
Oh my god.

1354
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:30,900
Chilled, oh my god.

1355
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:34,880
It's just a warm, you're right, it's just a warm up, guys.

1356
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:38,300
It's just a warm up.

1357
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,200
Not my fault!

1358
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:45,200
I should've moved up though, my position was so ass there.

1359
01:08:45,780 --> 01:08:47,200
I should've actually moved up.

1360
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,980
Actually, I don't know, I don't know if I live.

1361
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:53,960
If I live, if things would be different, because I was not close to ult at all.

1362
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,460
I wasn't even close to ult there.

1363
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:59,320
I don't know if me living would've helped us.

1364
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:03,180
But like, I got whaled so hard.

1365
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:06,340
Like, I was just like, goodbye life, I guess I die.

1366
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,900
I should've moved up though, definitely.

1367
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:12,500
I'm getting warmed up right now.

1368
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:14,600
I think I am getting farmed though.

1369
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:17,040
I feel bad, I'm sorry!

1370
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:23,740
I told them if they want to leave, they can leave whenever they want, because I know I'm not that good!

1371
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:25,880
I don't wanna die!

1372
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:30,460
I told them, I was like, please, you don't have to force yourself.

1373
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:35,340
It's okay, if you wanna leave.

1374
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:43,060
I know I'm the weakest link, so I get hard targeted there, because they're like, she doesn't know what she's doing!

1375
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:45,520
She only plays for fun!

1376
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:46,960
What is she doing?

1377
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:48,440
Why is she here?

1378
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:52,180
She doesn't even go into the school.

1379
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:53,820
Get her!

1380
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:55,660
She plays for fun, not for money!

1381
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:02,980
Doesn't have the competitive drive that we have.

1382
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:09,860
Imagine playing for fun, the classic hasting nerd.

1383
01:10:12,580 --> 01:10:15,380
I think I'm more casual though, because I don't scrim.

1384
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:19,520
Like, these players, the people I'm playing against, they fucking scrim every day.

1385
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:23,460
I've done scrims before in Overwatch, and that shit fucking kills me.

1386
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:27,380
They do scrims, they do VOD reviews.

1387
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:30,380
Yeah, but I just play ranked, that's different.

1388
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:31,360
I don't learn...

1389
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:37,900
I don't learn, I learn from sheer fucking brute force.

1390
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:46,280
I learn my positioning from figuring out what I'm doing wrong, and then just like, on the go, be like, oh, I shouldn't do that next time.

1391
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:49,440
But these players, they like, scrim every day.

1392
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:51,780
They do VOD reviews every fucking day.

1393
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:54,840
And they have coaching lessons every fucking day.

1394
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:56,360
And then I'm just here.

1395
01:10:57,220 --> 01:11:03,040
I hit my head against the wall until I learn something.

1396
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:05,100
That's basically what I do.

1397
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:10,280
Don't they have a... surprisingly...

1398
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:12,600
No, pro players do not have a...

1399
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:14,580
Pro players don't have a life.

1400
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:20,960
Their entire life is just playing this game to be the very best, and like, win tournament money.

1401
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:28,900
They actually, like, me knowing, like, pro players, they surprisingly just spend their entire life on a video game.

1402
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:33,080
I mean, I spend all my life streaming.

1403
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:39,280
The only difference between me and a pro player is that I don't have to do scrims or VOD reviews.

1404
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:40,680
Wow!

1405
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:44,220
I know, right?

1406
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:48,740
I can't believe I somehow queue into Kurova, Maze, and Gomez.

1407
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:50,160
Oh my god.

1408
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:55,470
Make more money?

1409
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:57,550
Well, to be fair, like...

1410
01:12:00,370 --> 01:12:00,890
Esports...

1411
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:02,590
Marvel Rivals is so new.

1412
01:12:02,770 --> 01:12:05,830
So, like, the funding for Marvel Rivals...

1413
01:12:05,830 --> 01:12:08,230
You know, like, first place, they got, like, $15,000.

1414
01:12:08,630 --> 01:12:10,330
But you gotta split that to six players.

1415
01:12:10,670 --> 01:12:12,150
And that was, like, two...

1416
01:12:12,150 --> 01:12:14,090
That's the crazy thing you think about it.

1417
01:12:16,010 --> 01:12:16,530
Like...

1418
01:12:17,150 --> 01:12:22,030
In a tournament, they get win 15... I think it was $15,000, right?

1419
01:12:23,550 --> 01:12:26,670
But then that's split six ways, too.

1420
01:12:26,790 --> 01:12:29,510
But it's the first tournament, so, like...

1421
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:31,310
Isn't esport in general a bad investment?

1422
01:12:31,530 --> 01:12:34,190
It's a bad investment in a way where, like...

1423
01:12:35,330 --> 01:12:39,270
It's a bad investment because, like, in the beginning...

1424
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:43,210
Because a lot of business people don't know what the fuck esport is.

1425
01:12:43,210 --> 01:12:46,210
And because they don't know what esports are...

1426
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:48,470
They're, like...

1427
01:12:49,090 --> 01:12:53,490
They put a lot of money thinking it's gonna be, like, Major League Baseball.

1428
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:54,870
Overwatch League.

1429
01:12:57,570 --> 01:12:58,690
I heard...

1430
01:12:58,990 --> 01:13:04,990
I heard some players were paid equivalent to, like, baseball players.

1431
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:07,570
Because they thought it was gonna be, like, Major League Baseball.

1432
01:13:08,690 --> 01:13:09,250
And...

1433
01:13:10,330 --> 01:13:11,650
Because of that...

1434
01:13:11,650 --> 01:13:13,230
They were paid, like...

1435
01:13:13,230 --> 01:13:15,850
Some wages were fucking ridiculous.

1436
01:13:18,510 --> 01:13:21,250
Some players were paid, like, $500,000.

1437
01:13:22,510 --> 01:13:23,630
For, like...

1438
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:25,590
Just being there.

1439
01:13:26,150 --> 01:13:28,810
Just, like, their salary was literally 500k.

1440
01:13:29,010 --> 01:13:30,250
Which was fucking insane.

1441
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:32,750
For Overwatch League.

1442
01:13:33,070 --> 01:13:34,550
Yeah, it was Overwatch League.

1443
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:37,870
Because a lot of them didn't know what, like...

1444
01:13:37,870 --> 01:13:39,810
They didn't know, like, what...

1445
01:13:39,810 --> 01:13:41,810
Like, what the...

1446
01:13:43,090 --> 01:13:44,350
What it should be.

1447
01:13:45,130 --> 01:13:45,630
Like...

1448
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:47,430
Because it was so very new.

1449
01:13:47,650 --> 01:13:48,870
So they're, like...

1450
01:13:48,870 --> 01:13:50,730
What should be what we paid for?

1451
01:13:51,130 --> 01:13:51,630
You know?

1452
01:13:52,130 --> 01:13:54,210
People were so, like, confused.

1453
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:56,590
On, like, what the potential was.

1454
01:13:56,670 --> 01:13:57,730
Oh my god, I'm frame dropping.

1455
01:13:59,490 --> 01:14:00,350
We're locked up.

1456
01:14:01,290 --> 01:14:01,920
I'm trying to...

1457
01:14:09,790 --> 01:14:10,790
Oh my god.

1458
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:16,760
Jesus Christ.

1459
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:25,340
He's low.

1460
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:29,060
How about change on me?

1461
01:14:32,980 --> 01:14:34,020
Oh my god.

1462
01:14:35,860 --> 01:14:36,980
There's more behind me?

1463
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:47,030
I don't like being up here.

1464
01:14:53,490 --> 01:14:56,310
Alright, I guess I'm here.

1465
01:14:57,990 --> 01:14:59,970
I guess I'm here now.

1466
01:15:00,510 --> 01:15:01,930
God, I was frame dropping hard.

1467
01:15:02,070 --> 01:15:02,770
That was crazy.

1468
01:15:03,150 --> 01:15:04,250
I was scared.

1469
01:15:04,350 --> 01:15:05,730
I was like, oh no, I'm frame dropping.

1470
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:09,830
Like, that...

1471
01:15:09,830 --> 01:15:11,870
That was scary for me.

1472
01:15:12,430 --> 01:15:13,090
That was...

1473
01:15:14,830 --> 01:15:16,250
I was like, oh no.

1474
01:15:17,010 --> 01:15:17,710
Oh no.

1475
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:20,050
I'm ulting.

1476
01:15:22,950 --> 01:15:23,590
Weeeee.

1477
01:15:24,750 --> 01:15:25,390
Weeeee.

1478
01:15:27,810 --> 01:15:29,010
Weeeee.

1479
01:15:29,630 --> 01:15:30,330
Well...

1480
01:15:31,030 --> 01:15:31,230
Weeeee.

1481
01:15:35,290 --> 01:15:35,990
Nice.

1482
01:15:37,090 --> 01:15:37,710
Slay.

1483
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:42,220
That's fine.

1484
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:46,880
That's my inner monologue when I fucking...

1485
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,820
When I play Luna.

1486
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:55,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1487
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:59,600
Sorry, I just wanna heal.

1488
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:01,820
I just...

1489
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:04,420
I just had no perspective.

1490
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:06,440
When I heal.

1491
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:10,920
I have to reload, sorry.

1492
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:13,780
Oh my god, please.

1493
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:16,660
Fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear.

1494
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:19,060
Oh, I have a...

1495
01:16:19,060 --> 01:16:19,900
A Psylocke up behind me.

1496
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:22,580
Oh my god.

1497
01:16:30,180 --> 01:16:30,640
Nooooo.

1498
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:31,860
Alright.

1499
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:32,820
Fear.

1500
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:36,460
He like pinned me off because he saw me fearing.

1501
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:38,640
I didn't realize this...

1502
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:39,700
I got killed by a Hawkeye?

1503
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:40,700
Do you have a Hawkeye?

1504
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:41,720
We didn't ban Hawkeye.

1505
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:42,640
What did we ban?

1506
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:48,280
I was like, what did we ban?

1507
01:16:52,220 --> 01:16:54,300
I'm just surprised we have Hawkeye.

1508
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:56,160
I have to position myself differently.

1509
01:16:57,980 --> 01:16:59,240
Oh my god.

1510
01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:03,120
I gotta position myself in a way.

1511
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:06,840
Is there a Psylocke behind you guys?

1512
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:07,460
She's half?

1513
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:14,800
Goodbye.

1514
01:17:19,060 --> 01:17:20,140
Psylocke behind?

1515
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:22,880
Okay.

1516
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:24,920
That's five.

1517
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:27,680
That's so five.

1518
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:31,180
Where people are?

1519
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:34,720
Oh.

1520
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:36,520
She never missed.

1521
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,400
But what if I'm here though?

1522
01:17:43,980 --> 01:17:44,900
Oh.

1523
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:46,220
I'm back up.

1524
01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:50,580
Why do you guys wanna farm me?

1525
01:17:51,180 --> 01:17:53,380
I just wanna be...

1526
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:56,360
I just wanna make a YouTube video.

1527
01:17:56,540 --> 01:17:57,260
I can't see you.

1528
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:04,520
I just...

1529
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:07,700
I just wanna make a YouTube video.

1530
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:11,960
If I never get it, you'll never be in the YouTube video.

1531
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:14,180
Enemy champion team.

1532
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:16,620
Don't you wanna...

1533
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:17,780
Psylocke behind you.

1534
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:18,840
They're gonna hide.

1535
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:19,660
They're gonna hide.

1536
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:25,040
Don't you also wanna be on a YouTube...

1537
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:28,140
There'll only be a YouTube video if I get my goal.

1538
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:33,460
Oh, what?

1539
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:34,180
Oh.

1540
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:36,340
I got Hawkeye'd.

1541
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:38,760
I got the kill out.

1542
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:40,380
What?

1543
01:18:40,580 --> 01:18:41,920
This is why I hate Hawkeye.

1544
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:43,500
This is exactly why.

1545
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:47,560
Read advertisement.

1546
01:18:49,580 --> 01:18:50,980
I thought they were all dead.

1547
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:52,040
But they're alive.

1548
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:56,340
I legitimately thought they were all dead.

1549
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:57,820
But they're alive.

1550
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:02,120
Look, I have a deal.

1551
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:07,140
You will be in my YouTube video if you stop trying to farm me.

1552
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:12,260
Isn't that so cool?

1553
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:17,280
Wouldn't that be so cool?

1554
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:19,120
Guys!

1555
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:25,380
I got it.

1556
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,380
Alright, let's go.

1557
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:32,940
There we go.

1558
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,660
It's ending now.

1559
01:19:42,650 --> 01:19:43,670
That's fine.

1560
01:19:45,490 --> 01:19:46,610
That's fine.

1561
01:19:48,510 --> 01:19:49,790
Look at this freak.

1562
01:19:50,290 --> 01:19:51,930
They get to be in the video!

1563
01:19:56,510 --> 01:19:57,310
I don't know.

1564
01:19:57,350 --> 01:19:58,810
I don't know if they're actually...

1565
01:19:58,810 --> 01:20:02,370
Because if they're stacking, then they'll always be against me.

1566
01:20:02,550 --> 01:20:03,890
So it's a little scary.

1567
01:20:04,910 --> 01:20:08,010
It's a little scary.

1568
01:20:09,370 --> 01:20:10,370
Because of that.

1569
01:20:11,830 --> 01:20:12,930
That's why I'm scared.

1570
01:20:13,110 --> 01:20:16,330
Because they'll always be on the enemy team.

1571
01:20:16,610 --> 01:20:18,990
And I have to try so hard!

1572
01:20:23,330 --> 01:20:24,410
He shot.

1573
01:20:29,650 --> 01:20:30,370
Please.

1574
01:20:30,890 --> 01:20:32,470
This is my make-a-wish.

1575
01:20:34,570 --> 01:20:37,310
This is my make-a-wish.

1576
01:20:37,570 --> 01:20:37,850
Please.

1577
01:20:44,980 --> 01:20:46,280
Am I winning?

1578
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:48,100
I don't know.

1579
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,800
This is supposed to be my VTuber Shroud Vicka win.

1580
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:04,340
No more on top.

1581
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:05,240
He's on me.

1582
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:05,760
No more on top.

1583
01:21:05,860 --> 01:21:06,820
Yeah, yeah.

1584
01:21:13,630 --> 01:21:13,990
Alright.

1585
01:21:18,670 --> 01:21:19,190
I have ult.

1586
01:21:19,290 --> 01:21:19,510
I have ult.

1587
01:21:19,510 --> 01:21:21,110
I have to be if I die.

1588
01:21:22,270 --> 01:21:23,190
There's one on top.

1589
01:21:25,210 --> 01:21:26,350
I have to ult.

1590
01:21:26,950 --> 01:21:27,690
I was wanting to.

1591
01:21:29,390 --> 01:21:30,810
Oh my god.

1592
01:21:33,830 --> 01:21:34,870
Oh my god.

1593
01:21:34,910 --> 01:21:35,850
They have Psylocke here.

1594
01:21:43,050 --> 01:21:44,430
Oh my god.

1595
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:50,930
Oh my god.

1596
01:21:50,930 --> 01:21:51,710
We can't.

1597
01:21:51,890 --> 01:21:52,850
Stop whining.

1598
01:21:54,350 --> 01:21:55,150
I didn't.

1599
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:56,230
I had to ult there.

1600
01:21:56,290 --> 01:21:56,950
I was 1 HP.

1601
01:21:57,290 --> 01:21:59,370
If he dashed through me, I'd die.

1602
01:22:00,090 --> 01:22:02,470
I didn't think I could get healed in time for it.

1603
01:22:05,950 --> 01:22:07,430
That was why I had to ult that.

1604
01:22:07,970 --> 01:22:08,190
It's okay.

1605
01:22:08,250 --> 01:22:09,170
We can full hold, guys.

1606
01:22:09,430 --> 01:22:10,930
We can full hold.

1607
01:22:12,050 --> 01:22:13,990
YouTube's make-a-wish on Twitch.

1608
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:15,810
Right point.

1609
01:22:18,210 --> 01:22:20,870
It was literally, I died from...

1610
01:22:20,870 --> 01:22:24,290
I died from the turret plus the dash, so I had to.

1611
01:22:25,810 --> 01:22:28,930
I knew, like, right after, I was gonna get...

1612
01:22:28,930 --> 01:22:31,330
It was gonna be like 20 different ults.

1613
01:22:33,650 --> 01:22:34,490
It's okay.

1614
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:37,010
If I get farmed, it's okay.

1615
01:22:37,010 --> 01:22:41,170
I can't do 16 hours.

1616
01:22:41,370 --> 01:22:42,350
I can't.

1617
01:22:42,850 --> 01:22:44,270
Maybe they'll get tired.

1618
01:22:44,670 --> 01:22:44,990
Maybe.

1619
01:22:45,450 --> 01:22:47,090
Maybe they have to...

1620
01:22:47,090 --> 01:22:47,350
Oh, wait.

1621
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:48,370
Tournament's over.

1622
01:22:48,530 --> 01:22:49,210
They're free.

1623
01:22:49,510 --> 01:22:51,550
They're free now.

1624
01:22:52,090 --> 01:22:52,810
They're free.

1625
01:22:54,590 --> 01:22:55,370
Tournament's over.

1626
01:22:55,490 --> 01:22:57,230
They can farm me as long as they want.

1627
01:23:00,230 --> 01:23:01,430
I forgot.

1628
01:23:01,730 --> 01:23:03,750
I forgot the tournament's over.

1629
01:23:04,130 --> 01:23:06,990
We might be here for a while until it's their bedtime.

1630
01:23:06,990 --> 01:23:07,470
I...

1631
01:23:13,310 --> 01:23:15,250
Watch me get farmed.

1632
01:23:15,530 --> 01:23:16,110
Hey, guys.

1633
01:23:16,190 --> 01:23:17,070
Have you ever seen a...

1634
01:23:17,070 --> 01:23:19,990
No, everybody's seen a YouTuber get farmed.

1635
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:22,290
It ain't new.

1636
01:23:23,970 --> 01:23:24,310
I did.

1637
01:23:24,410 --> 01:23:27,690
I literally, like, rested for, like, almost, like, a day and a half.

1638
01:23:31,210 --> 01:23:31,950
It's fine.

1639
01:23:32,030 --> 01:23:32,670
I'm locked in.

1640
01:23:34,910 --> 01:23:36,230
I'm so locked in.

1641
01:23:36,230 --> 01:23:36,930
Guys.

1642
01:23:37,370 --> 01:23:38,830
I'm not dooming no more!

1643
01:23:40,770 --> 01:23:41,930
Don't worry!

1644
01:23:42,390 --> 01:23:43,550
I ain't no doomer!

1645
01:23:43,770 --> 01:23:44,330
It's winnable!

1646
01:23:45,210 --> 01:23:47,530
I'm not a doomer, I swear!

1647
01:23:50,810 --> 01:23:51,910
There's a...

1648
01:23:51,910 --> 01:23:52,950
There's Psylocke to the right.

1649
01:23:55,930 --> 01:23:57,410
I'm not gonna doom!

1650
01:23:58,130 --> 01:23:59,270
Everything is winnable!

1651
01:24:03,670 --> 01:24:05,430
I hear Psylocke above us.

1652
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:11,230
Oh, I tried.

1653
01:24:13,990 --> 01:24:15,150
Psylocke's behind you.

1654
01:24:19,710 --> 01:24:20,650
It's okay.

1655
01:24:23,510 --> 01:24:24,150
Believe.

1656
01:24:24,290 --> 01:24:25,350
We can still believe.

1657
01:24:25,570 --> 01:24:27,650
It was just the unfortunate Psylocke.

1658
01:24:31,290 --> 01:24:32,330
It's okay.

1659
01:24:33,870 --> 01:24:35,010
Guys, like...

1660
01:24:35,010 --> 01:24:36,370
I'm just a little guy.

1661
01:24:37,130 --> 01:24:38,610
But, like, I still believe.

1662
01:24:41,450 --> 01:24:46,070
It's gonna make the victories much more cooler when we do have our first win.

1663
01:24:51,350 --> 01:24:52,590
Let's just make it.

1664
01:24:52,890 --> 01:24:54,210
I can't see you up there.

1665
01:25:02,710 --> 01:25:03,410
Oh my god.

1666
01:25:04,110 --> 01:25:04,590
Nice.

1667
01:25:08,180 --> 01:25:09,360
I can't even see him.

1668
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:11,960
I got it, I got it, I got it.

1669
01:25:13,180 --> 01:25:14,100
Okay, it's fine.

1670
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:15,060
We all lived at least.

1671
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:19,560
My crew told me when you went ult.

1672
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:26,740
He didn't tell me.

1673
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:29,300
He stopped telling me when he went into ult.

1674
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:33,240
He was so far away.

1675
01:25:38,540 --> 01:25:40,220
There's an Amour behind us.

1676
01:25:41,780 --> 01:25:42,700
I can't go for it.

1677
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:45,120
I got your back.

1678
01:25:45,220 --> 01:25:45,920
Oh my god.

1679
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:48,780
He couldn't tell me when he went ult.

1680
01:25:48,940 --> 01:25:49,940
I got confused.

1681
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:51,860
It's okay.

1682
01:25:54,180 --> 01:25:55,220
That was my bad.

1683
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:58,660
I can't even touch with TP.

1684
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:02,420
I feel bad.

1685
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:03,660
I feel bad.

1686
01:26:03,820 --> 01:26:06,540
I'm confused from, like, the ult.

1687
01:26:06,540 --> 01:26:10,900
Sometimes he wants it first and sometimes he doesn't.

1688
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:14,280
I feel bad.

1689
01:26:15,660 --> 01:26:17,700
I feel a little bad.

1690
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:21,220
Okay, Jk, I feel really bad.

1691
01:26:30,860 --> 01:26:31,420
Hey,

1692
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:37,220
wouldn't it be great if we had a support ult?

1693
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:41,100
Yeah, yeah, I'll ask her next time.

1694
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:44,060
I thought she was, like...

1695
01:26:44,980 --> 01:26:47,200
She was, like, really far.

1696
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:51,340
So then I thought, because he was really far, I should ult there.

1697
01:26:56,450 --> 01:26:57,050
It's fine.

1698
01:26:57,870 --> 01:26:58,930
It's so fine.

1699
01:26:59,990 --> 01:27:01,030
It's so fine.

1700
01:27:02,090 --> 01:27:03,130
This is a...

1701
01:27:04,090 --> 01:27:05,710
We can full hold this!

1702
01:27:08,870 --> 01:27:09,890
It's okay!

1703
01:27:12,870 --> 01:27:15,810
My Make-A-Wish is... I wanted to donate.

1704
01:27:15,930 --> 01:27:16,930
I'm so kind.

1705
01:27:17,290 --> 01:27:18,470
This wasn't a Make-A-Wish.

1706
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:22,050
This is early Christmas presents to the Marvel Rival players.

1707
01:27:24,550 --> 01:27:25,830
I just...

1708
01:27:27,970 --> 01:27:28,610
Okay.

1709
01:27:30,870 --> 01:27:31,510
Okay.

1710
01:27:31,510 --> 01:27:34,810
That was actually so smart of us.

1711
01:27:40,410 --> 01:27:41,850
Merry Christmas!

1712
01:27:42,530 --> 01:27:43,830
I'm here to donate.

1713
01:27:44,450 --> 01:27:45,890
Donate points.

1714
01:27:48,510 --> 01:27:49,970
Merry Christmas.

1715
01:27:51,050 --> 01:27:54,030
It's my late night Christmas present.

1716
01:27:56,870 --> 01:27:58,190
I'm here.

1717
01:27:58,410 --> 01:27:59,930
I'm here to donate.

1718
01:28:00,490 --> 01:28:01,970
I'm here to donate.

1719
01:28:02,170 --> 01:28:03,730
I'm here to donate all the points.

1720
01:28:20,990 --> 01:28:23,990
I'm just not... never ulting first.

1721
01:28:26,150 --> 01:28:28,170
I'm just telling you guys, I'm never ulting first.

1722
01:28:28,270 --> 01:28:29,510
I'm never ulting first.

1723
01:28:30,310 --> 01:28:32,630
I'm just never ulting first.

1724
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:34,750
Oh my god.

1725
01:28:36,150 --> 01:28:39,510
At this point, I'll never ult first again.

1726
01:28:41,610 --> 01:28:43,490
I'm never ulting first.

1727
01:28:43,990 --> 01:28:44,690
I'm sorry.

1728
01:28:47,350 --> 01:28:49,470
I'm in my head now.

1729
01:28:50,270 --> 01:28:53,410
After the first game, I'm too confused.

1730
01:28:53,510 --> 01:28:54,930
I went to ult first.

1731
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:00,870
I'm way too confused now.

1732
01:29:00,970 --> 01:29:03,490
I'm way over my head.

1733
01:29:06,970 --> 01:29:08,470
I'm never ulting first.

1734
01:29:08,570 --> 01:29:10,170
I'm just gonna let him ult.

1735
01:29:10,630 --> 01:29:14,910
I'm just gonna restrain myself from ulting and I'm just gonna let him ult.

1736
01:29:15,070 --> 01:29:15,670
Fuck it.

1737
01:29:15,670 --> 01:29:16,110
I...

1738
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:25,240
You die though?

1739
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:26,300
It's alright.

1740
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:27,980
I'd rather die.

1741
01:29:28,420 --> 01:29:30,860
I'd rather fucking die.

1742
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:32,600
If...

1743
01:29:34,380 --> 01:29:36,220
Double support ult.

1744
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:39,840
I haven't had that problem in fucking...

1745
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:45,340
I haven't had the fucking double support ult problem in so fucking long.

1746
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:47,360
I don't know why.

1747
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:50,500
Today is just one of those days.

1748
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:52,160
I told you!

1749
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:52,880
I told you!

1750
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:54,200
I told you!

1751
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:56,520
I told you I'd do a fake snipe!

1752
01:29:56,580 --> 01:29:57,300
I could feel it.

1753
01:29:57,620 --> 01:29:58,560
I could feel it.

1754
01:29:58,640 --> 01:29:59,900
They're like, get her out of here.

1755
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:04,120
She's not even a pro player.

1756
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:05,320
Get her out of here.

1757
01:30:09,140 --> 01:30:10,820
She's the weakest link.

1758
01:30:11,220 --> 01:30:12,340
So farmable.

1759
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:13,660
So submissive.

1760
01:30:14,540 --> 01:30:15,560
And I agree.

1761
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:16,620
I'm very farmable.

1762
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:17,780
Because I'm not...

1763
01:30:17,780 --> 01:30:21,920
Every time I finish rank, I just fucking... I have to do work stuff.

1764
01:30:22,180 --> 01:30:24,440
I have to prep for work and everything.

1765
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:28,960
Because guys, even though I'm playing Marvel Rivals every day...

1766
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:35,560
After Marvel Rivals, I actually have a lot of behind the scenes work to do.

1767
01:30:35,700 --> 01:30:39,320
Like conventions and sponsors and merch and stuff.

1768
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:40,660
So it's like...

1769
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:42,520
If I could...

1770
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:44,680
It's not always Marvel Rivals.

1771
01:30:46,380 --> 01:30:48,980
I'm very busy also.

1772
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:51,460
But it's okay.

1773
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:52,920
I know my place.

1774
01:30:54,940 --> 01:30:56,800
No, I've been... I'll let you guys know.

1775
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:00,420
The last couple of times streaming this, I've been stream sniped a lot.

1776
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:03,280
Which is why sometimes I play...

1777
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:05,540
I do miss playing off stream.

1778
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:11,760
Because it's surprising how easy games are when I'm playing off stream.

1779
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:13,800
And now, I've never...

1780
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:16,860
Because when you're on YouTube, you don't get stream sniped on YouTube.

1781
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:19,860
Because it's like, they don't know I exist on YouTube.

1782
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:24,260
No, it's not that.

1783
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:28,240
I never get stream sniped when I was on YouTube.

1784
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:30,140
Because they don't know about my existence.

1785
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:33,260
But ever since I started streaming on Twitch...

1786
01:31:33,260 --> 01:31:37,580
I didn't talk about it a lot, but this one has been the most obvious stream sniping.

1787
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:44,680
Because making a stack and queuing against...

1788
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:46,940
You'll always get queued against another stack.

1789
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:52,300
I've heard people do that for other streamers.

1790
01:31:52,660 --> 01:31:53,780
But this is the first time.

1791
01:31:54,100 --> 01:31:55,460
Because this is my first stack.

1792
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:58,080
Because in the past, I've been...

1793
01:31:59,460 --> 01:32:01,820
I've been only duoing and trioing.

1794
01:32:01,940 --> 01:32:04,700
So it's harder to stream snipe duos and trios.

1795
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:06,880
So like...

1796
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:10,700
But I have been stream sniped by other duos before.

1797
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:11,780
I've recognized it.

1798
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:14,000
Because I've had somebody...

1799
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,700
One of my friends told me...

1800
01:32:16,860 --> 01:32:19,260
Was it a streamer?

1801
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:23,820
There was a player that literally stopped their queue...

1802
01:32:23,820 --> 01:32:25,880
To wait for me to queue up.

1803
01:32:26,300 --> 01:32:28,140
And then just to play against me.

1804
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:29,060
To try and fire me.

1805
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:30,320
I was like, that's cringe.

1806
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:31,880
That's so cringe.

1807
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:33,440
On stream!

1808
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:34,880
Like what?

1809
01:32:35,140 --> 01:32:36,440
That's so cringe.

1810
01:32:37,300 --> 01:32:38,380
On stream?

1811
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:40,780
Like...

1812
01:32:41,780 --> 01:32:43,680
Like what the fuck?

1813
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:48,420
What's wrong with you?

1814
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:51,320
That's crazy.

1815
01:32:51,660 --> 01:32:52,280
I know.

1816
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:55,140
I'm just trying to fuck around.

1817
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:01,100
But I've had it happen the last...

1818
01:33:01,100 --> 01:33:02,580
Every time I stream on Twitch.

1819
01:33:02,580 --> 01:33:03,540
I've had it happen.

1820
01:33:04,140 --> 01:33:05,940
So that's why like...

1821
01:33:05,940 --> 01:33:08,400
I'm trying not to let it get to me.

1822
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:09,580
Because I'm just like, oh whatever.

1823
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:11,260
I'm just trying to...

1824
01:33:11,260 --> 01:33:13,260
I'm just trying to have fun.

1825
01:33:15,820 --> 01:33:17,580
That's why after this season...

1826
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:19,820
I swear...

1827
01:33:19,820 --> 01:33:21,960
Stream snipers, after this season...

1828
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:24,140
You won't see me here as often.

1829
01:33:24,340 --> 01:33:25,800
Please let me have fun.

1830
01:33:28,300 --> 01:33:30,260
It's just for this season.

1831
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:32,860
It's just for this season.

1832
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:34,380
I'll return to YouTube.

1833
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:41,100
No, I'll still stream on Twitch.

1834
01:33:41,260 --> 01:33:42,440
I'll still stream on Twitch.

1835
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:43,400
It's just that...

1836
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:45,440
I've always said after this season...

1837
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:47,600
I'll return back to regularly stream on YouTube.

1838
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:49,940
But I'll try to stream on Twitch once a week.

1839
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:51,080
Like...

1840
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:52,260
At most...

1841
01:33:52,260 --> 01:33:54,380
Like once a week or once every other week.

1842
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:55,700
After this season.

1843
01:33:55,860 --> 01:33:59,000
It's only because I really want to try and get top 500 this season.

1844
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,660
That I'm doing this.

1845
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:02,560
That I'm on Twitch.

1846
01:34:02,660 --> 01:34:03,720
Because I hate...

1847
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:06,160
I hate no scheduled...

1848
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:07,880
No scheduled streams on YouTube.

1849
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:09,640
Because I also like...

1850
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:11,320
I have to pay my thumb...

1851
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:12,580
I really feel really bad.

1852
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:15,220
Because I have to pay my thumbnail maker.

1853
01:34:16,700 --> 01:34:18,060
I have to like...

1854
01:34:18,060 --> 01:34:19,800
Ask my thumbnail maker...

1855
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:21,140
To make...

1856
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:24,180
To make thumbnails and stuff.

1857
01:34:24,340 --> 01:34:25,960
But like very last minute.

1858
01:34:27,540 --> 01:34:29,300
But what if you don't make it?

1859
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:30,760
Please don't say that guys.

1860
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:32,940
I don't want to do this all over again.

1861
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:35,100
I don't want to...

1862
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:41,120
I don't want to do this all over again.

1863
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:43,440
Don't do this to me.

1864
01:34:49,260 --> 01:34:50,660
Don't do this to me.

1865
01:34:56,940 --> 01:34:59,680
We want to be free.

1866
01:35:09,340 --> 01:35:10,020
Alright,

1867
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:16,300
I'm locking in.

1868
01:35:18,780 --> 01:35:19,280
I'm... Okay.

1869
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:22,980
Okay, he's not on Mantis or Luna.

1870
01:35:23,560 --> 01:35:25,440
He's not on Mantis or Luna.

1871
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:26,240
So...

1872
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:27,180
I can...

1873
01:35:27,180 --> 01:35:27,620
Whenever.

1874
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:29,340
I'm also in my head right now.

1875
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:31,200
Support ults after the first game.

1876
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:36,460
I don't like multi-streams.

1877
01:35:36,540 --> 01:35:37,940
I never like multi-streams.

1878
01:35:38,620 --> 01:35:39,280
Because...

1879
01:35:42,100 --> 01:35:43,420
Because like...

1880
01:35:44,070 --> 01:35:45,820
I don't like dividing attention.

1881
01:35:46,140 --> 01:35:47,600
Between two different chats.

1882
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:51,500
Chat preying on your downfall.

1883
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:52,200
If you...

1884
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:53,580
Oh my god.

1885
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:55,700
Oh my god.

1886
01:36:00,820 --> 01:36:02,140
Guys, don't please.

1887
01:36:02,300 --> 01:36:03,080
We want to get...

1888
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:03,780
Guys, please.

1889
01:36:03,940 --> 01:36:05,440
I need a return on YouTube.

1890
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:08,080
I need a return on YouTube.

1891
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:11,720
I don't...

1892
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:14,380
I still don't like dividing attention to two different chats.

1893
01:36:14,460 --> 01:36:15,180
It's just...

1894
01:36:15,180 --> 01:36:15,520
I'm like...

1895
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:17,660
I don't like dividing the audience base too.

1896
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:18,140
I like...

1897
01:36:18,140 --> 01:36:19,960
I'd rather have all my audience in one area.

1898
01:36:25,240 --> 01:36:27,760
I just like having them all in one area.

1899
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:30,180
I'm not a fan of like two areas...

1900
01:36:30,180 --> 01:36:30,840
Like in...

1901
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:31,940
Both areas.

1902
01:36:35,700 --> 01:36:37,200
It's just not my thing.

1903
01:36:37,420 --> 01:36:38,020
I like having...

1904
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:39,680
In one spot.

1905
01:36:41,700 --> 01:36:44,200
I'm trying to be positive in the darkest of the night.

1906
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:45,860
I'm just...

1907
01:36:45,860 --> 01:36:48,240
I'm trying to be positive right now.

1908
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:51,080
Please.

1909
01:36:51,560 --> 01:36:53,140
This is my make-a-wish.

1910
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:55,980
Rival players, please.

1911
01:36:56,100 --> 01:36:57,240
Let me have...

1912
01:36:57,240 --> 01:36:57,640
Please.

1913
01:36:57,780 --> 01:36:58,840
You didn't...

1914
01:36:58,840 --> 01:37:00,100
You sniped Shroud this badly.

1915
01:37:00,620 --> 01:37:01,240
Please.

1916
01:37:01,700 --> 01:37:03,040
Shroud is streaming right now.

1917
01:37:03,620 --> 01:37:06,140
You wanna be on Shroud's team, don't you?

1918
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:08,300
I'm just a VTuber.

1919
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:17,600
He's sniping me.

1920
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:18,640
It's not fun.

1921
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:20,000
It's not as cool.

1922
01:37:22,460 --> 01:37:24,260
It's not as cool.

1923
01:37:25,220 --> 01:37:26,520
Just think about it.

1924
01:37:28,860 --> 01:37:30,220
Jesus Christ.

1925
01:37:35,620 --> 01:37:37,300
Just think about it.

1926
01:37:38,260 --> 01:37:41,240
It'd be so much cooler to snipe Shroud.

1927
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:41,760
Woah.

1928
01:37:42,620 --> 01:37:43,780
But I don't endorse it.

1929
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,720
Just if you really want to snipe anybody.

1930
01:37:48,380 --> 01:37:51,100
I, of course, I do not endorse sniping.

1931
01:37:54,700 --> 01:37:55,040
But...

1932
01:37:55,380 --> 01:37:56,340
Oh, I'm...

1933
01:38:02,130 --> 01:38:02,850
I win.

1934
01:38:04,690 --> 01:38:06,930
3, 2, 1.

1935
01:38:10,750 --> 01:38:12,370
Oh my...

1936
01:38:12,910 --> 01:38:13,410
No!

1937
01:38:20,570 --> 01:38:22,290
Oh my god.

1938
01:38:22,430 --> 01:38:24,170
Bro, I just...

1939
01:38:24,610 --> 01:38:25,890
I'm sorry.

1940
01:38:29,130 --> 01:38:30,830
I said it!

1941
01:38:34,010 --> 01:38:35,310
Oh my god.

1942
01:38:35,410 --> 01:38:36,690
I'm just...

1943
01:38:40,730 --> 01:38:42,670
I can't help it!

1944
01:38:43,350 --> 01:38:46,630
I literally tapped and saw that he didn't have his ult.

1945
01:38:51,130 --> 01:38:52,150
Oh my god.

1946
01:38:52,170 --> 01:38:54,250
I literally saw that he did have his ult.

1947
01:38:54,350 --> 01:38:56,290
I don't know how he got it so fast.

1948
01:38:56,810 --> 01:38:57,930
How did he get it so...

1949
01:38:57,930 --> 01:38:58,210
Okay.

1950
01:38:58,570 --> 01:38:59,050
I'm locked in.

1951
01:38:59,170 --> 01:39:00,310
Actually, I'm fucking...

1952
01:39:00,310 --> 01:39:02,690
Oh my, I'm so tilted at that.

1953
01:39:03,690 --> 01:39:04,650
3, 2, 1.

1954
01:39:05,190 --> 01:39:08,130
Oh my god.

1955
01:39:08,210 --> 01:39:09,010
That actually...

1956
01:39:09,010 --> 01:39:11,270
That actually tilts me so hard.

1957
01:39:11,950 --> 01:39:14,150
I feel so bad.

1958
01:39:24,910 --> 01:39:25,730
Don't ult.

1959
01:39:26,050 --> 01:39:26,450
Don't ult.

1960
01:39:26,790 --> 01:39:27,270
Don't ult.

1961
01:39:27,670 --> 01:39:28,110
Don't ult.

1962
01:39:29,230 --> 01:39:30,290
Oh my god.

1963
01:39:30,630 --> 01:39:30,950
Okay.

1964
01:39:31,550 --> 01:39:31,870
Alright.

1965
01:39:33,310 --> 01:39:33,870
Okay.

1966
01:39:34,470 --> 01:39:39,190
I've never played so badly with Corrin in terms of like support ulting.

1967
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:39,870
That's actually...

1968
01:39:40,510 --> 01:39:42,430
I don't know what it is with me and Kurova.

1969
01:39:42,970 --> 01:39:46,110
I think we just have like negative chemistry on support together.

1970
01:39:46,590 --> 01:39:50,710
I didn't think it'd be possible.

1971
01:39:51,330 --> 01:39:53,270
I think I found my like...

1972
01:39:54,170 --> 01:39:56,890
I think I literally found like my...

1973
01:39:56,890 --> 01:39:59,190
My negative support partner.

1974
01:39:59,490 --> 01:40:00,890
We have zero synergy.

1975
01:40:00,890 --> 01:40:02,090
I'm so sorry.

1976
01:40:07,010 --> 01:40:10,030
Wait, there's no more right behind us, guys.

1977
01:40:22,930 --> 01:40:27,570
I didn't know who keep me up was.

1978
01:40:32,070 --> 01:40:34,110
I didn't know who it was.

1979
01:40:35,730 --> 01:40:36,950
It didn't show.

1980
01:40:37,050 --> 01:40:37,710
I don't have the...

1981
01:40:37,710 --> 01:40:39,010
I don't have the...

1982
01:40:42,940 --> 01:40:44,000
Oh my god.

1983
01:40:44,060 --> 01:40:45,460
I didn't have the thing.

1984
01:40:45,580 --> 01:40:46,240
Top left.

1985
01:40:50,180 --> 01:40:51,860
It's like keep me up.

1986
01:40:52,340 --> 01:40:53,760
Who was it?

1987
01:40:53,860 --> 01:40:54,960
Who said that?

1988
01:40:55,080 --> 01:40:56,480
I thought it was Hella.

1989
01:40:57,200 --> 01:40:58,640
I thought it was Hella.

1990
01:41:02,740 --> 01:41:04,160
Keep fighting until we have a winner.

1991
01:41:10,640 --> 01:41:11,720
That's not important.

1992
01:41:12,380 --> 01:41:12,900
I have to reload.

1993
01:41:13,140 --> 01:41:14,340
3, 2, 1.

1994
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:15,320
Oh my god.

1995
01:41:17,780 --> 01:41:18,640
I'm gonna die.

1996
01:41:19,340 --> 01:41:20,480
Oh my god.

1997
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:21,240
To reload.

1998
01:41:24,280 --> 01:41:25,400
The voices.

1999
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:30,940
What's the word for opposite synergy?

2000
01:41:31,160 --> 01:41:32,320
What we seeing right now.

2001
01:41:33,140 --> 01:41:35,380
What we're seeing right now.

2002
01:41:38,440 --> 01:41:43,480
This is the most opposite synergy I've ever had with other support.

2003
01:41:43,660 --> 01:41:46,200
I'm like brute forcing synergy right now.

2004
01:41:46,680 --> 01:41:47,440
Don't worry.

2005
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:49,040
We'll go to therapy.

2006
01:41:49,640 --> 01:41:52,840
We'll go to support therapy to fix this.

2007
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:56,520
We can fix this.

2008
01:41:56,940 --> 01:42:00,020
We will force synergy if we have to.

2009
01:42:00,020 --> 01:42:01,880
I can't.

2010
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:05,140
Don't.

2011
01:42:05,420 --> 01:42:06,060
Oh, it's me.

2012
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:07,780
It's not you, Kurova.

2013
01:42:08,140 --> 01:42:09,620
It's me.

2014
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:15,400
I'm sorry.

2015
01:42:15,580 --> 01:42:16,780
I'm the problem.

2016
01:42:17,820 --> 01:42:20,320
We can fix this, but you can leave.

2017
01:42:20,440 --> 01:42:21,840
You can take 50%.

2018
01:42:25,540 --> 01:42:29,160
We will force synergy if we have to.

2019
01:42:31,300 --> 01:42:32,040
I...

2020
01:42:32,860 --> 01:42:33,600
Alright.

2021
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:38,060
Oh my god.

2022
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:40,480
It's fine.

2023
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:44,320
Oh my god.

2024
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:45,720
Fear.

2025
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:46,100
Fear.

2026
01:42:46,420 --> 01:42:46,840
Fear.

2027
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:47,200
Fear.

2028
01:42:47,380 --> 01:42:47,660
Fear.

2029
01:42:48,060 --> 01:42:48,680
Fear.

2030
01:42:50,720 --> 01:42:51,460
Fear.

2031
01:42:53,260 --> 01:42:54,000
Fear.

2032
01:42:54,860 --> 01:42:55,600
Fear.

2033
01:42:57,540 --> 01:42:58,280
Fear.

2034
01:42:58,940 --> 01:42:59,310
Fear.

2035
01:42:59,310 --> 01:43:00,230
Fear still.

2036
01:43:01,070 --> 01:43:01,530
Fear.

2037
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:08,940
Oh my god.

2038
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:12,180
Fear.

2039
01:43:14,740 --> 01:43:15,320
Fear.

2040
01:43:15,540 --> 01:43:16,620
So much fear.

2041
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:20,720
Oh,

2042
01:43:24,550 --> 01:43:25,090
fear.

2043
01:43:25,750 --> 01:43:26,310
Fear!

2044
01:43:28,510 --> 01:43:29,170
Fear!

2045
01:43:33,470 --> 01:43:34,810
I did it!

2046
01:43:34,810 --> 01:43:36,990
I weakened force chemistry!

2047
01:43:38,570 --> 01:43:39,710
See, guys?

2048
01:43:39,870 --> 01:43:41,390
Never give up on your relationships.

2049
01:43:41,890 --> 01:43:42,230
Never.

2050
01:43:45,070 --> 01:43:46,350
Never give up.

2051
01:43:46,790 --> 01:43:49,690
You can force something out of nothing.

2052
01:43:52,620 --> 01:43:53,530
That's the lesson.

2053
01:43:54,530 --> 01:43:56,070
We don't need therapy.

2054
01:43:56,870 --> 01:44:00,210
We can just manually fix this through brute force.

2055
01:44:01,350 --> 01:44:03,130
Through the risk of rank 1.

2056
01:44:03,130 --> 01:44:05,970
There's a... there's a stream behind me.

2057
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:14,780
Oh my god.

2058
01:44:17,300 --> 01:44:18,500
Oh my god.

2059
01:44:20,620 --> 01:44:23,960
Guys, but if your relationship is an issue, you should go to therapy.

2060
01:44:24,700 --> 01:44:25,020
Guys!

2061
01:44:26,900 --> 01:44:28,340
Forcing things is not it.

2062
01:44:29,140 --> 01:44:30,980
I'm just doing it for the sake of...

2063
01:44:30,980 --> 01:44:34,040
But if you're in a competition, you might as well.

2064
01:44:36,820 --> 01:44:37,460
Fear.

2065
01:44:38,020 --> 01:44:38,200
Fear.

2066
01:44:41,260 --> 01:44:42,660
There's a strange on me.

2067
01:44:45,680 --> 01:44:46,920
He's still on me!

2068
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:53,520
I have to hit, I have to... I'll just...

2069
01:44:56,580 --> 01:44:58,320
Oh my god.

2070
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:02,060
3, 2, 1...

2071
01:45:06,420 --> 01:45:07,360
Holo one.

2072
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:07,780
Holo one.

2073
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:08,260
Holo one.

2074
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:10,940
I'm warned.

2075
01:45:10,980 --> 01:45:11,120
I'm warned.

2076
01:45:11,240 --> 01:45:11,400
I'm warned.

2077
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:11,760
I'm warned.

2078
01:45:14,720 --> 01:45:16,600
Oh my god!

2079
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:19,040
This is a fixable relationship!

2080
01:45:20,280 --> 01:45:21,940
We can do this!

2081
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:25,280
We can do this!

2082
01:45:26,180 --> 01:45:27,580
We can force synergy!

2083
01:45:31,100 --> 01:45:33,260
We can force it!

2084
01:45:33,260 --> 01:45:35,280
It's not broken!

2085
01:45:36,100 --> 01:45:37,500
It's fixable!

2086
01:45:41,680 --> 01:45:45,760
The spark is still there.

2087
01:45:50,240 --> 01:45:51,780
It's fixable.

2088
01:45:54,760 --> 01:45:57,120
It's fixable.

2089
01:45:57,420 --> 01:45:59,160
It's so fixable.

2090
01:46:01,240 --> 01:46:02,160
I believe.

2091
01:46:08,180 --> 01:46:12,780
Even if we lose this, at least we know it's not negative.

2092
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:13,960
It's like zero now.

2093
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:16,320
The synergy is at zero, but at least it's not negative.

2094
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:18,520
And that's all that matters.

2095
01:46:22,220 --> 01:46:24,370
Even if it's not negative anymore.

2096
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:35,700
Zero point... If we win this, it becomes zero point one.

2097
01:46:36,180 --> 01:46:38,400
If we win this.

2098
01:46:43,460 --> 01:46:45,640
We figured it out.

2099
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:49,540
Slowly but surely, we figured it out.

2100
01:46:51,640 --> 01:46:55,940
I was a problem, and I was willing to change.

2101
01:46:59,160 --> 01:47:02,280
Oh my god, that frame drop was crazy though.

2102
01:47:08,910 --> 01:47:09,390
Oh.

2103
01:47:09,790 --> 01:47:10,690
Oh.

2104
01:47:11,490 --> 01:47:12,310
Oh.

2105
01:47:16,710 --> 01:47:17,670
Oh.

2106
01:47:23,490 --> 01:47:27,050
Alright, here we go.

2107
01:47:32,190 --> 01:47:32,990
Alright, there we go.

2108
01:47:34,870 --> 01:47:35,990
There we go.

2109
01:47:36,170 --> 01:47:38,810
I'm gonna

2110
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:46,580
ult here, I'm gonna ult here, I'm gonna ult here.

2111
01:47:47,180 --> 01:47:47,540
That's me.

2112
01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:51,060
I had Zul too, but he got shamed over it.

2113
01:47:52,740 --> 01:47:53,180
Alright.

2114
01:47:57,180 --> 01:47:57,920
Phantus can die.

2115
01:47:58,600 --> 01:47:59,040
Yippee!

2116
01:47:59,040 --> 01:47:59,640
Yippee!

2117
01:48:01,940 --> 01:48:02,860
Yippee!

2118
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:08,260
It's fine.

2119
01:48:09,860 --> 01:48:11,540
Oh my god.

2120
01:48:15,620 --> 01:48:18,200
Did that ult hit me while ulting?

2121
01:48:18,340 --> 01:48:19,620
I don't know what happened.

2122
01:48:20,380 --> 01:48:23,980
I actually... I don't know what happened.

2123
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:25,980
I don't know.

2124
01:48:28,220 --> 01:48:32,340
I'm legitimately just as confused as you guys are.

2125
01:48:32,340 --> 01:48:33,980
Oh my...

2126
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:41,040
Like, I'm so confused.

2127
01:48:41,720 --> 01:48:42,760
What happened?

2128
01:48:47,100 --> 01:48:48,060
Like...

2129
01:48:50,350 --> 01:48:52,590
I don't even know what happened.

2130
01:48:56,520 --> 01:48:57,820
Jesus Christ.

2131
01:49:05,030 --> 01:49:06,230
Oh my god.

2132
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:14,020
I need help, I need help.

2133
01:49:14,140 --> 01:49:14,340
Oh.

2134
01:49:15,200 --> 01:49:15,780
Hey guys.

2135
01:49:19,400 --> 01:49:20,480
It's fine.

2136
01:49:23,100 --> 01:49:25,360
Oh, I got hit by Hella there.

2137
01:49:32,580 --> 01:49:33,760
I'm gonna ult this.

2138
01:49:35,740 --> 01:49:36,600
Come on.

2139
01:49:38,160 --> 01:49:39,580
Oh my god.

2140
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:42,740
Oh my god.

2141
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:46,020
This is technically last fight.

2142
01:49:47,300 --> 01:49:48,340
Oh shit.

2143
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:53,600
Jesus Christ.

2144
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:54,880
That was last fight.

2145
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:56,820
Oh my god.

2146
01:49:56,940 --> 01:49:58,580
I got Hella moment right there.

2147
01:50:01,940 --> 01:50:04,780
I got Hella... Wait, can we touch... No, there's no way.

2148
01:50:05,400 --> 01:50:06,400
No, there's no way.

2149
01:50:06,540 --> 01:50:08,040
I was gonna say.

2150
01:50:11,480 --> 01:50:14,820
I was gonna say.

2151
01:50:15,500 --> 01:50:16,560
It's okay guys.

2152
01:50:16,740 --> 01:50:19,200
Now we know the synergy is at zero now.

2153
01:50:19,480 --> 01:50:21,480
We've made it to like...

2154
01:50:21,480 --> 01:50:24,700
It's not negative because we fixed the synergy issue.

2155
01:50:25,100 --> 01:50:27,680
We fixed it, so it's at zero now.

2156
01:50:28,160 --> 01:50:30,700
I think the issue is that like...

2157
01:50:30,700 --> 01:50:32,080
I'm bad.

2158
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:34,080
As the...

2159
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:41,120
It's at... At least...

2160
01:50:41,120 --> 01:50:42,800
That's the...

2161
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:45,680
Now that we fixed the issue...

2162
01:50:45,680 --> 01:50:46,860
Wait here.

2163
01:50:51,660 --> 01:50:56,340
Now that we fixed the synergy issue...

2164
01:50:56,340 --> 01:50:58,700
Now it's the skill issue.

2165
01:50:58,700 --> 01:51:01,720
I got my Oshies washed.

2166
01:51:02,100 --> 01:51:04,680
Now it's just the skill issue.

2167
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:07,560
So, we gotta work on that.

2168
01:51:08,360 --> 01:51:11,460
We gotta work on skill.

2169
01:51:13,140 --> 01:51:14,720
We need... Honestly, no.

2170
01:51:14,780 --> 01:51:16,240
We need a team building exercise.

2171
01:51:16,980 --> 01:51:21,820
We need a fucking team building exercise here.

2172
01:51:22,460 --> 01:51:24,440
I need a team building exercise.

2173
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:28,620
I think maybe...

2174
01:51:28,620 --> 01:51:29,960
No, no, no, no, no.

2175
01:51:30,020 --> 01:51:30,820
We don't need therapy.

2176
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:33,160
We fixed the support synergy now.

2177
01:51:33,260 --> 01:51:34,200
Now it's at zero.

2178
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:36,340
Like, things should be fine.

2179
01:51:36,940 --> 01:51:38,280
We're at zero now.

2180
01:51:38,420 --> 01:51:39,380
Now this is it!

2181
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:43,100
The moment we win the game, it's up... It's all uphill.

2182
01:51:43,480 --> 01:51:45,180
As in like, it's gonna go well.

2183
01:51:45,380 --> 01:51:46,460
Now that we won.

2184
01:51:47,900 --> 01:51:49,220
We need family therapy.

2185
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:51,440
We don't need... It's not a support issue anymore.

2186
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:53,080
Now it's just family therapy.

2187
01:51:53,080 --> 01:51:53,800
Right...

2188
01:51:55,460 --> 01:51:56,000
Now...

2189
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:57,660
Now it's a...

2190
01:51:58,340 --> 01:52:00,680
Now it's a family therapy session.

2191
01:52:03,660 --> 01:52:04,200
Now...

2192
01:52:04,200 --> 01:52:06,600
I'm also not used to such high elo...

2193
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:08,760
Like, super high elo games too.

2194
01:52:09,940 --> 01:52:11,800
So like, I'm learning as we go.

2195
01:52:11,860 --> 01:52:14,960
I'm like... I'm just a fucking lowly Eternity player.

2196
01:52:16,120 --> 01:52:17,700
So like, it's fine.

2197
01:52:18,340 --> 01:52:19,420
I'm just...

2198
01:52:19,420 --> 01:52:22,280
I'm getting... I'm learning how to be a better player though from this.

2199
01:52:22,280 --> 01:52:23,800
From Brute Force alone.

2200
01:52:24,540 --> 01:52:27,280
At the risk of everybody else's rink ruins, I'm...

2201
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,800
At least I'm like, learning how to play better.

2202
01:52:35,400 --> 01:52:36,760
Guys, that's a positive.

2203
01:52:37,880 --> 01:52:40,580
That's... I'm learning how to be a better player.

2204
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:43,080
At the expense of everybody else.

2205
01:52:43,160 --> 01:52:43,760
Thank you.

2206
01:52:47,700 --> 01:52:48,720
Enlightened, a major.

2207
01:52:48,920 --> 01:52:49,980
Thank you for the Twitch Prime.

2208
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:51,140
Thank you, thank you.

2209
01:52:53,180 --> 01:52:56,620
It's a sacrifice I'm willing to make...

2210
01:52:59,080 --> 01:53:02,280
It's a sacrifice I'm willing to make...

2211
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:05,000
At the risk of everybody's expense.

2212
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:07,960
Did I ask their permission?

2213
01:53:08,660 --> 01:53:09,240
No.

2214
01:53:09,240 --> 01:53:09,360
No.

2215
01:53:20,160 --> 01:53:23,720
I'm gonna hold all your points hostage.

2216
01:53:33,020 --> 01:53:33,380
Alright.

2217
01:53:36,040 --> 01:53:37,420
Some of you may derank.

2218
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:38,940
Most likely me.

2219
01:53:39,240 --> 01:53:41,500
But that's the risk I'm willing to take.

2220
01:53:54,870 --> 01:53:56,430
Wait, hold on.

2221
01:53:58,950 --> 01:54:01,730
That's not how the phrase goes.

2222
01:54:07,150 --> 01:54:07,790
Look.

2223
01:54:08,610 --> 01:54:11,910
It just means we'll be better players in the end.

2224
01:54:12,070 --> 01:54:14,430
Guys, I'm establishing synergy.

2225
01:54:15,510 --> 01:54:17,230
I've literally made...

2226
01:54:17,230 --> 01:54:18,670
A miracle has happened.

2227
01:54:19,190 --> 01:54:21,670
I swear, we definitely have negative synergy.

2228
01:54:21,790 --> 01:54:22,470
I swear to God.

2229
01:54:24,470 --> 01:54:25,310
After...

2230
01:54:25,310 --> 01:54:29,310
We definitely had negative synergy going in.

2231
01:54:29,570 --> 01:54:31,010
But now it's different.

2232
01:54:31,530 --> 01:54:33,290
Now it's like...

2233
01:54:33,290 --> 01:54:35,070
Now it's a lot better.

2234
01:54:35,670 --> 01:54:36,330
It's zero.

2235
01:54:37,110 --> 01:54:38,830
So it's not negative.

2236
01:54:39,230 --> 01:54:40,430
It's zero now.

2237
01:54:41,670 --> 01:54:44,210
So like, we're getting there.

2238
01:54:46,030 --> 01:54:49,290
We won't bash our head in.

2239
01:54:53,730 --> 01:54:55,650
Yo, is that the fucking god team or what?

2240
01:54:56,490 --> 01:54:58,270
No, on me this is the god team.

2241
01:54:58,690 --> 01:54:59,870
We gotta go to therapy.

2242
01:55:00,010 --> 01:55:01,130
We are not going to therapy.

2243
01:55:01,290 --> 01:55:02,770
We don't need couple counseling anymore.

2244
01:55:02,850 --> 01:55:04,630
We don't need support counseling anymore.

2245
01:55:05,190 --> 01:55:05,910
We don't...

2246
01:55:05,910 --> 01:55:09,010
We can fix this without professional help.

2247
01:55:12,130 --> 01:55:14,310
We don't need professional help.

2248
01:55:15,670 --> 01:55:17,150
We're fixable without them.

2249
01:55:18,670 --> 01:55:19,150
X.

2250
01:55:21,630 --> 01:55:22,070
Mmm.

2251
01:55:29,010 --> 01:55:29,750
It'll be fine.

2252
01:55:32,150 --> 01:55:33,370
It'll be so fine.

2253
01:55:38,640 --> 01:55:39,520
I ult second.

2254
01:55:41,100 --> 01:55:43,280
I'm like so in my head though because of this.

2255
01:55:43,680 --> 01:55:44,740
Do you want to take this corner?

2256
01:55:47,540 --> 01:55:48,620
Okay, take the corner.

2257
01:55:49,280 --> 01:55:50,160
Or we can take that corner.

2258
01:55:51,320 --> 01:55:52,420
Or we'll bring the right corner.

2259
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:55,860
Oh.

2260
01:55:55,920 --> 01:55:57,160
Oh man.

2261
01:56:00,500 --> 01:56:03,440
I'm gonna push the cart a little bit.

2262
01:56:06,500 --> 01:56:07,000
Oh no.

2263
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:16,740
Hey yo.

2264
01:56:19,920 --> 01:56:21,280
Hey yo.

2265
01:56:24,380 --> 01:56:24,980
Oh my god.

2266
01:56:24,980 --> 01:56:25,780
I'm pushing cart.

2267
01:56:30,140 --> 01:56:31,760
Look at him go.

2268
01:56:38,340 --> 01:56:43,500
Oh my god, look at these cams.

2269
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:46,600
There's a stream behind you guys.

2270
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:48,300
There's a stream behind.

2271
01:56:51,280 --> 01:56:52,480
Oh my god.

2272
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:54,140
Change, change, change, change.

2273
01:56:55,180 --> 01:56:56,080
Change half.

2274
01:56:59,300 --> 01:57:01,480
Oh my god, there we go.

2275
01:57:02,320 --> 01:57:02,740
Oh.

2276
01:57:03,640 --> 01:57:04,480
Where'd he go?

2277
01:57:05,360 --> 01:57:06,060
Where'd he fucking go?

2278
01:57:08,180 --> 01:57:09,120
Where did he go?

2279
01:57:09,640 --> 01:57:11,680
Where did he go?

2280
01:57:11,680 --> 01:57:11,820
Where'd he go?

2281
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:19,780
Also, I got confirmation that stack was...

2282
01:57:19,780 --> 01:57:21,660
That force stack was sniping us.

2283
01:57:22,340 --> 01:57:25,680
Oh my god.

2284
01:57:32,680 --> 01:57:33,980
Oh my god.

2285
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:36,280
Yeah, isn't that cringe?

2286
01:57:37,680 --> 01:57:39,480
You won first in the tournament.

2287
01:57:39,980 --> 01:57:41,720
What do you need my points for?

2288
01:57:41,720 --> 01:57:43,620
You already got the money.

2289
01:57:47,640 --> 01:57:50,220
You already got the money.

2290
01:57:50,640 --> 01:57:51,980
You already got first place.

2291
01:57:52,300 --> 01:57:54,240
What do you need my points for?

2292
01:57:54,980 --> 01:57:58,460
I don't understand.

2293
01:58:01,360 --> 01:58:03,920
They take money and points.

2294
01:58:04,240 --> 01:58:05,960
You don't understand, Toki.

2295
01:58:06,040 --> 01:58:07,380
They won it all.

2296
01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:09,460
You don't...

2297
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:14,800
It's not about...

2298
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:16,700
It's about everything.

2299
01:58:22,120 --> 01:58:23,080
Okay.

2300
01:58:29,440 --> 01:58:33,100
I won it all and I won it now.

2301
01:58:33,580 --> 01:58:36,540
It's not about the money, Toki.

2302
01:58:36,640 --> 01:58:38,620
It's about sending a message.

2303
01:58:40,360 --> 01:58:41,440
He did.

2304
01:58:41,780 --> 01:58:43,980
He definitely sent a message.

2305
01:58:47,160 --> 01:58:47,840
Toki...

2306
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:48,580
Oh, that's true.

2307
01:58:48,660 --> 01:58:50,500
I had more viewers than the tournament.

2308
01:58:51,320 --> 01:58:52,380
Nevermind, it's understandable.

2309
01:58:52,920 --> 01:58:53,840
It's understandable.

2310
01:58:56,840 --> 01:58:58,720
Nevermind, I understand now.

2311
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:03,480
I don't have ult.

2312
01:59:09,500 --> 01:59:11,660
They're pushing me.

2313
01:59:17,740 --> 01:59:22,380
I'm focusing Mag.

2314
01:59:25,780 --> 01:59:27,180
Ulting.

2315
01:59:27,780 --> 01:59:30,340
Oh my god.

2316
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:33,340
Psylocke to your left.

2317
01:59:36,980 --> 01:59:39,300
They won it all.

2318
01:59:39,300 --> 01:59:41,320
They won it all.

2319
01:59:47,400 --> 01:59:50,560
It truly is a dark world.

2320
01:59:54,560 --> 01:59:55,920
I can ulti here.

2321
01:59:57,560 --> 01:59:58,780
I'm pushing cart.

2322
02:00:00,300 --> 02:00:01,660
Heard, heard.

2323
02:00:01,860 --> 02:00:02,460
Goodbye.

2324
02:00:03,820 --> 02:00:05,780
You only have cloak heals.

2325
02:00:06,160 --> 02:00:07,240
Out, out, out, out, out, out.

2326
02:00:07,280 --> 02:00:07,740
Everyone out.

2327
02:00:07,740 --> 02:00:09,480
Get out, get out, get out.

2328
02:00:11,320 --> 02:00:12,280
Here I go.

2329
02:00:17,980 --> 02:00:19,780
Here I go.

2330
02:00:20,860 --> 02:00:22,720
Wait, what is Toki asking about?

2331
02:00:23,880 --> 02:00:26,840
I was like, I think they're sniping.

2332
02:00:27,020 --> 02:00:30,020
Because they're force stacking and I'm force stacking.

2333
02:00:30,560 --> 02:00:32,300
So, like, it's weird, you know?

2334
02:00:35,380 --> 02:00:37,000
It's weird, because it's like...

2335
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,920
If you force stack, you always get the enemy.

2336
02:00:40,040 --> 02:00:40,740
You always...

2337
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:48,000
I'm trying to save you.

2338
02:00:48,280 --> 02:00:50,100
He's asleep, he's asleep.

2339
02:00:55,520 --> 02:00:56,140
Nice.

2340
02:00:58,700 --> 02:01:00,320
Farming you for points.

2341
02:01:00,920 --> 02:01:02,040
They won it all.

2342
02:01:04,380 --> 02:01:06,820
They're not happy with winning the tournament.

2343
02:01:11,320 --> 02:01:12,520
Oh my god.

2344
02:01:12,640 --> 02:01:13,360
This is it.

2345
02:01:13,700 --> 02:01:14,440
This is it.

2346
02:01:18,140 --> 02:01:20,060
They won my points.

2347
02:01:21,960 --> 02:01:26,560
They've been paid by the devs to keep you from reaching your goals.

2348
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,140
So see you all next season.

2349
02:01:31,900 --> 02:01:32,880
You're right.

2350
02:01:33,240 --> 02:01:34,680
I got a hit on me.

2351
02:01:34,900 --> 02:01:35,640
I got...

2352
02:01:36,600 --> 02:01:38,740
I got a fucking hit on me.

2353
02:01:38,740 --> 02:01:39,940
I'm on the list now.

2354
02:01:39,940 --> 02:01:41,740
I'm on the list.

2355
02:01:48,530 --> 02:01:52,350
And I still won't be sponsored.

2356
02:01:56,810 --> 02:01:57,390
I'm sorry.

2357
02:01:59,110 --> 02:02:00,110
Alright, let's go.

2358
02:02:04,190 --> 02:02:06,990
Keep her in purgatory so she'll be here forever.

2359
02:02:06,990 --> 02:02:10,990
She'll be stuck here in the fucking slums.

2360
02:02:14,130 --> 02:02:16,750
Oh, it's that one more win hit.

2361
02:02:16,970 --> 02:02:18,490
It's like the...

2362
02:02:18,490 --> 02:02:19,670
They're trying to keep me.

2363
02:02:19,710 --> 02:02:20,470
It's like one more hit.

2364
02:02:20,930 --> 02:02:21,830
Come on, just one more.

2365
02:02:21,950 --> 02:02:22,910
Just one more win.

2366
02:02:23,270 --> 02:02:26,810
Just one more win and then you can uninstall the game.

2367
02:02:27,010 --> 02:02:28,410
Then you can uninstall it.

2368
02:02:33,790 --> 02:02:34,990
Just one more.

2369
02:02:35,070 --> 02:02:35,690
One more.

2370
02:02:36,990 --> 02:02:39,170
Three, two, one.

2371
02:02:41,860 --> 02:02:43,720
The tournament is done.

2372
02:02:44,500 --> 02:02:51,460
The tournament is done.

2373
02:02:51,780 --> 02:02:57,080
I will never stop digging.

2374
02:02:57,400 --> 02:02:58,080
I will never.

2375
02:02:58,780 --> 02:02:59,320
They know.

2376
02:03:00,140 --> 02:03:01,780
They know what I want.

2377
02:03:02,140 --> 02:03:03,440
And stats that need it.

2378
02:03:03,700 --> 02:03:04,460
Oh, good stuff.

2379
02:03:10,110 --> 02:03:11,410
Oh my god.

2380
02:03:12,350 --> 02:03:13,070
Goodbye.

2381
02:03:13,910 --> 02:03:15,370
Goodbye, Mr. Fister.

2382
02:03:16,430 --> 02:03:17,110
Goodbye.

2383
02:03:17,330 --> 02:03:18,130
You're locked up.

2384
02:03:21,700 --> 02:03:22,980
Jesus Christ.

2385
02:03:26,500 --> 02:03:27,840
Oh my god.

2386
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:29,940
Jesus Christ.

2387
02:03:30,020 --> 02:03:30,980
I'm playing in it.

2388
02:03:37,960 --> 02:03:39,420
Alright, where are you?

2389
02:03:40,040 --> 02:03:40,960
Where are you?

2390
02:03:41,920 --> 02:03:43,760
Do you still have your damage boost?

2391
02:03:46,700 --> 02:03:47,860
Oh my god.

2392
02:03:47,940 --> 02:03:52,220
Oh my god.

2393
02:03:55,400 --> 02:03:56,600
I didn't see it.

2394
02:03:56,660 --> 02:03:57,600
I didn't see the mystery.

2395
02:03:57,760 --> 02:03:59,100
I don't want to spoil myself.

2396
02:04:00,080 --> 02:04:02,500
Because I want to experience it.

2397
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:10,020
I want to experience it during when I play the season on YouTube, by the way.

2398
02:04:10,400 --> 02:04:13,760
I'm going to do YouTube streams for checking out the new season stuff.

2399
02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:15,760
But rank stuff would be...

2400
02:04:17,680 --> 02:04:19,760
The rank stuff would be on...

2401
02:04:22,680 --> 02:04:26,040
I slept him, I slept him.

2402
02:04:29,220 --> 02:04:30,720
Do they have Groodle?

2403
02:04:37,680 --> 02:04:38,200
Alright.

2404
02:04:39,560 --> 02:04:40,740
There's a group behind, guys.

2405
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:41,440
Group behind.

2406
02:04:42,120 --> 02:04:42,600
I'm ulting.

2407
02:04:43,760 --> 02:04:44,700
Oh, we're dead.

2408
02:04:47,660 --> 02:04:48,480
We're dead.

2409
02:04:49,180 --> 02:04:49,860
The moon.

2410
02:04:53,640 --> 02:04:54,740
The moon.

2411
02:04:57,360 --> 02:04:58,760
The moon.

2412
02:05:01,740 --> 02:05:03,560
You're still stalling.

2413
02:05:03,700 --> 02:05:04,680
Our Thor is stalling.

2414
02:05:14,860 --> 02:05:18,630
Oh my god.

2415
02:05:18,630 --> 02:05:20,730
I have a Bengi on me.

2416
02:05:22,610 --> 02:05:24,150
Oh my god.

2417
02:05:24,210 --> 02:05:25,530
Not the moon.

2418
02:05:29,430 --> 02:05:32,410
The scream about the portal.

2419
02:05:34,570 --> 02:05:35,870
Portal's gone.

2420
02:05:37,070 --> 02:05:37,490
No.

2421
02:05:38,290 --> 02:05:39,590
Not the portal.

2422
02:05:40,430 --> 02:05:43,570
That poor guy.

2423
02:05:49,870 --> 02:05:51,390
Not the portal.

2424
02:05:54,150 --> 02:05:56,330
Not the fucking portal.

2425
02:06:02,710 --> 02:06:04,010
Oh my god.

2426
02:06:04,110 --> 02:06:04,650
Who said that?

2427
02:06:04,710 --> 02:06:05,590
Is that Mr. Fister?

2428
02:06:06,250 --> 02:06:06,890
Where is he?

2429
02:06:06,970 --> 02:06:07,810
There's a Psylocke behind.

2430
02:06:11,010 --> 02:06:12,390
There's a Psylocke behind us.

2431
02:06:13,690 --> 02:06:15,550
Oh my god.

2432
02:06:15,590 --> 02:06:16,230
Look at him go.

2433
02:06:18,270 --> 02:06:21,030
Oh, he got up.

2434
02:06:22,690 --> 02:06:24,390
Shake it off.

2435
02:06:25,690 --> 02:06:26,410
Nice.

2436
02:06:27,470 --> 02:06:29,010
Oh my god.

2437
02:06:29,610 --> 02:06:31,190
He fisted them.

2438
02:06:33,550 --> 02:06:35,510
Look at him go.

2439
02:06:35,790 --> 02:06:37,150
Look at our Fister go.

2440
02:06:37,630 --> 02:06:38,750
Look at him go.

2441
02:06:39,430 --> 02:06:40,230
We're safe.

2442
02:06:40,430 --> 02:06:40,670
No.

2443
02:06:42,170 --> 02:06:43,730
Oh my god.

2444
02:06:45,910 --> 02:06:47,070
I couldn't.

2445
02:06:47,290 --> 02:06:49,350
I couldn't live through that.

2446
02:06:49,610 --> 02:06:51,030
I got all the pockets in the world.

2447
02:06:51,810 --> 02:06:53,930
Yeah, I couldn't live through that.

2448
02:06:54,710 --> 02:06:56,890
We let the Fister down.

2449
02:07:04,970 --> 02:07:06,070
We're gonna have the...

2450
02:07:07,030 --> 02:07:07,790
Watch out for the portal.

2451
02:07:07,950 --> 02:07:08,330
Watch out for the portal.

2452
02:07:09,930 --> 02:07:10,810
I thought...

2453
02:07:11,370 --> 02:07:13,270
I mean, you'll be fine, right?

2454
02:07:14,570 --> 02:07:15,750
There's a Psylocke all out there.

2455
02:07:16,690 --> 02:07:17,610
I'm stalling for him.

2456
02:07:17,730 --> 02:07:18,330
I'm stalling for him.

2457
02:07:18,410 --> 02:07:18,970
I'm stalling for him.

2458
02:07:19,910 --> 02:07:21,510
Yeah, Psylocke ult.

2459
02:07:25,490 --> 02:07:28,110
They had Psylocke ult.

2460
02:07:31,760 --> 02:07:33,560
Oh, I can't see anything.

2461
02:07:34,760 --> 02:07:36,760
I'm fucking blind.

2462
02:07:38,680 --> 02:07:40,620
He's doing it.

2463
02:07:42,640 --> 02:07:45,800
I dodged everything, but then I still get fucked.

2464
02:07:50,520 --> 02:07:51,860
Oh my god.

2465
02:07:52,660 --> 02:07:53,700
They're all on, all on, all on.

2466
02:07:53,800 --> 02:07:54,120
Just walk up.

2467
02:07:56,780 --> 02:07:57,660
Nevermind, I lied.

2468
02:07:59,980 --> 02:08:00,920
Oh, the tree.

2469
02:08:01,100 --> 02:08:02,540
I thought I could slip that in.

2470
02:08:03,340 --> 02:08:06,060
I was like, haha, I can slip this in.

2471
02:08:08,180 --> 02:08:08,660
Fear.

2472
02:08:10,520 --> 02:08:11,000
Fear.

2473
02:08:12,420 --> 02:08:12,900
Fear.

2474
02:08:12,900 --> 02:08:13,740
Actual fear.

2475
02:08:14,680 --> 02:08:16,120
Oh my god.

2476
02:08:17,560 --> 02:08:19,340
I got the shark.

2477
02:08:19,780 --> 02:08:21,500
The fact that...

2478
02:08:22,040 --> 02:08:24,440
The shark went for me.

2479
02:08:24,640 --> 02:08:26,000
Did you guys see that?

2480
02:08:26,520 --> 02:08:29,280
The shark went for me and then...

2481
02:08:29,280 --> 02:08:31,300
I got double solo ulted.

2482
02:08:32,020 --> 02:08:33,440
Like, what the fuck is this?

2483
02:08:33,640 --> 02:08:34,620
They're all freaks.

2484
02:08:37,260 --> 02:08:41,280
Like, how did I get double solo ulted?

2485
02:08:41,280 --> 02:08:41,860
There.

2486
02:08:43,420 --> 02:08:48,280
How the fuck was that possible?

2487
02:08:49,440 --> 02:08:50,140
He's low again.

2488
02:08:51,640 --> 02:08:52,040
Okay.

2489
02:08:54,480 --> 02:08:55,280
I, what?

2490
02:09:00,100 --> 02:09:02,940
How was I in it?

2491
02:09:03,220 --> 02:09:04,440
Oh no, it was not in it.

2492
02:09:04,480 --> 02:09:06,060
I was not in it.

2493
02:09:08,080 --> 02:09:09,200
I'm coming over.

2494
02:09:09,420 --> 02:09:10,900
If you guys can live, I'm still close to ult.

2495
02:09:14,700 --> 02:09:15,740
Body, body.

2496
02:09:16,400 --> 02:09:17,420
Oh my god.

2497
02:09:21,360 --> 02:09:23,240
I'm on Groot.

2498
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:27,940
Magnio's low too.

2499
02:09:29,680 --> 02:09:30,840
Please, they're both low.

2500
02:09:34,240 --> 02:09:35,000
Oh my god.

2501
02:09:35,480 --> 02:09:36,100
What is this?

2502
02:09:36,160 --> 02:09:38,300
Why did I get triple solo ulted?

2503
02:09:38,400 --> 02:09:40,080
I'm fucking just a little guy.

2504
02:09:40,720 --> 02:09:42,720
I'm just a little guy.

2505
02:09:42,720 --> 02:09:43,060
I...

2506
02:09:46,580 --> 02:09:50,380
She's cackling getting double solo ulted.

2507
02:09:50,540 --> 02:09:51,860
What can I do?

2508
02:09:52,460 --> 02:09:59,520
The fact that the shark aimed for me and his ult and then...

2509
02:09:59,520 --> 02:10:00,880
Oh my god.

2510
02:10:02,680 --> 02:10:04,160
That's actually crazy.

2511
02:10:09,620 --> 02:10:11,780
I'm like just a little guy.

2512
02:10:11,780 --> 02:10:15,600
I'm literally just a little guy trying to make it in this world.

2513
02:10:16,660 --> 02:10:19,860
I didn't know Mantis has tank aggro.

2514
02:10:23,460 --> 02:10:25,960
The shark could've ate anybody else.

2515
02:10:26,220 --> 02:10:30,240
Literally, we had the whole... I'm fucking... I'm gonna draw this out.

2516
02:10:30,680 --> 02:10:35,600
You know, you guys... I know you guys just saw this, but even I can't believe that happened.

2517
02:10:36,040 --> 02:10:37,300
So like, alright.

2518
02:10:37,640 --> 02:10:39,000
So this is the wall.

2519
02:10:39,240 --> 02:10:40,280
This is the car.

2520
02:10:40,280 --> 02:10:44,860
This is my entire team just standing around the car.

2521
02:10:45,260 --> 02:10:46,420
I'm here.

2522
02:10:46,500 --> 02:10:50,320
And then the shark was like, you know who to target?

2523
02:10:51,020 --> 02:10:54,540
That one person that's secluded.

2524
02:10:57,060 --> 02:10:57,640
It's okay.

2525
02:10:58,040 --> 02:10:59,380
I'm gonna show you guys.

2526
02:10:59,560 --> 02:10:59,820
Don't worry.

2527
02:10:59,880 --> 02:11:02,140
I drew it and I'm gonna show you guys.

2528
02:11:04,200 --> 02:11:05,500
Oh my god.

2529
02:11:05,960 --> 02:11:07,580
Wait, did my stream crash?

2530
02:11:09,280 --> 02:11:10,560
Oh no, it didn't.

2531
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:11,840
Where did my stream go?

2532
02:11:12,320 --> 02:11:14,480
Where did my stream tab go?

2533
02:11:17,580 --> 02:11:20,600
Guys, I lost my OBS.

2534
02:11:21,200 --> 02:11:22,580
My OBS disappeared.

2535
02:11:24,160 --> 02:11:27,020
Guys, I lost my OBS.

2536
02:11:28,060 --> 02:11:29,700
I don't know what happened to it.

2537
02:11:30,140 --> 02:11:32,180
It's not in my tabs anymore.

2538
02:11:32,840 --> 02:11:34,900
My OBS is not...

2539
02:11:34,900 --> 02:11:39,200
You guys still see yourself, but like, I don't have an OBS bar.

2540
02:11:39,640 --> 02:11:41,800
I don't have an OBS bar.

2541
02:11:42,660 --> 02:11:44,240
Where did it go?

2542
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:45,840
Tabs.

2543
02:11:46,600 --> 02:11:47,760
Where is my OBS?

2544
02:11:48,020 --> 02:11:51,300
The OBS app isn't even in my app!

2545
02:11:54,550 --> 02:11:56,050
Oh my god.

2546
02:11:56,290 --> 02:12:00,350
No, I did alt-tab to find it, but it's actually gone.

2547
02:12:00,630 --> 02:12:02,510
It's not even...

2548
02:12:02,510 --> 02:12:03,670
It's actually not...

2549
02:12:03,970 --> 02:12:05,030
It's just gone.

2550
02:12:07,270 --> 02:12:10,670
Oh, my OBS got sniped.

2551
02:12:10,950 --> 02:12:12,950
I literally don't see it.

2552
02:12:13,410 --> 02:12:15,070
Where did it go?

2553
02:12:17,050 --> 02:12:19,510
It disappeared in my apps.

2554
02:12:20,950 --> 02:12:22,510
OBS got solo'd.

2555
02:12:22,570 --> 02:12:23,970
I can't even show you.

2556
02:12:24,510 --> 02:12:26,270
I'm gonna put an imgur.

2557
02:12:28,090 --> 02:12:29,590
You will be missed.

2558
02:12:32,110 --> 02:12:34,170
Alright, guys, this is my...

2559
02:12:34,170 --> 02:12:35,810
No, it's not even in my task manager.

2560
02:12:35,810 --> 02:12:37,530
Alright, this is my picture.

2561
02:12:37,730 --> 02:12:39,810
So, like, as you guys can see...

2562
02:12:40,350 --> 02:12:42,230
So, that's the wall right there.

2563
02:12:42,710 --> 02:12:43,590
And then...

2564
02:12:43,590 --> 02:12:44,950
That's the wall.

2565
02:12:45,130 --> 02:12:47,630
And then the circle, that's the card over there.

2566
02:12:47,870 --> 02:12:50,550
And then there's, like, you know, five of my teammates.

2567
02:12:51,090 --> 02:12:51,370
Yeah?

2568
02:12:51,790 --> 02:12:52,810
There's five...

2569
02:12:57,390 --> 02:12:57,890
There's...

2570
02:12:57,890 --> 02:13:00,630
And that's me at the bottom.

2571
02:13:01,030 --> 02:13:02,270
By myself.

2572
02:13:02,770 --> 02:13:04,430
And then the shark was like...

2573
02:13:04,430 --> 02:13:05,950
Who do I eat?

2574
02:13:06,790 --> 02:13:07,390
Who...

2575
02:13:09,190 --> 02:13:10,510
Who do I eat?

2576
02:13:10,930 --> 02:13:14,430
And then they thought this right here was...

2577
02:13:15,390 --> 02:13:16,590
Was where...

2578
02:13:16,590 --> 02:13:20,050
Guys, I'm literally posting the imgur link in chat.

2579
02:13:20,230 --> 02:13:21,210
You see it now.

2580
02:13:22,670 --> 02:13:24,090
I have my OBS actually disappeared.

2581
02:13:24,250 --> 02:13:25,750
I can't see my OBS anymore.

2582
02:13:26,090 --> 02:13:27,570
It's not even, like...

2583
02:13:27,970 --> 02:13:29,510
It's not even in my apps.

2584
02:13:29,730 --> 02:13:30,490
For, like...

2585
02:13:32,430 --> 02:13:34,170
Like, that's the crazy part.

2586
02:13:34,170 --> 02:13:35,070
Like, I don't...

2587
02:13:35,070 --> 02:13:36,170
It's in my background...

2588
02:13:36,810 --> 02:13:37,070
Thing.

2589
02:13:37,370 --> 02:13:39,370
But, like, the whole thing is just gone.

2590
02:13:39,710 --> 02:13:41,090
It's literally gone.

2591
02:13:42,550 --> 02:13:44,930
What the fuck is that?

2592
02:13:46,730 --> 02:13:48,670
Just doing my best here.

2593
02:13:49,330 --> 02:13:52,810
I'm doing my best in this fucked up situation I'm in.

2594
02:13:53,290 --> 02:13:59,010
I'm doing my best.

2595
02:13:59,710 --> 02:14:01,790
Guys, I really am.

2596
02:14:04,170 --> 02:14:06,570
I did all of that with my mouse!

2597
02:14:06,890 --> 02:14:08,590
What do you want from me?

2598
02:14:09,210 --> 02:14:11,450
It was my mouse and keyboard.

2599
02:14:14,550 --> 02:14:16,010
What do you want from me?

2600
02:14:16,190 --> 02:14:17,330
I'm suffering here.

2601
02:14:27,930 --> 02:14:29,310
Alright, here we go.

2602
02:14:29,910 --> 02:14:31,490
This is where I suffer.

2603
02:14:37,470 --> 02:14:37,990
Woo!

2604
02:14:41,630 --> 02:14:45,270
Guys, I haven't done art in so long.

2605
02:14:48,310 --> 02:14:50,650
I actually haven't done art in a while, though.

2606
02:14:54,510 --> 02:14:54,930
Alright.

2607
02:14:55,150 --> 02:14:55,490
Oh!

2608
02:14:56,710 --> 02:14:57,970
Oh, can you taunt me out real quick?

2609
02:15:01,790 --> 02:15:02,310
Oh!

2610
02:15:06,220 --> 02:15:07,340
Oh my god!

2611
02:15:08,280 --> 02:15:10,360
Everything will be fine.

2612
02:15:13,740 --> 02:15:15,520
Everything will be fine.

2613
02:15:16,560 --> 02:15:16,720
Oh!

2614
02:15:17,040 --> 02:15:17,900
Right side, McNeil.

2615
02:15:17,980 --> 02:15:18,480
Right side, McNeil.

2616
02:15:21,080 --> 02:15:22,160
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

2617
02:15:22,420 --> 02:15:22,820
Oh, my.

2618
02:15:26,470 --> 02:15:27,610
Oh my god.

2619
02:15:29,510 --> 02:15:30,470
That's fine.

2620
02:15:30,610 --> 02:15:31,510
We're so healthy.

2621
02:15:32,110 --> 02:15:33,350
We're so healthy.

2622
02:15:34,150 --> 02:15:36,150
Everything is so healthy.

2623
02:15:39,230 --> 02:15:40,550
Everything is so...

2624
02:15:40,550 --> 02:15:41,110
What happened?

2625
02:15:41,470 --> 02:15:42,290
Who did I kill?

2626
02:15:45,150 --> 02:15:47,910
I don't even know what just happened.

2627
02:15:49,070 --> 02:15:50,090
So healthy.

2628
02:15:52,150 --> 02:15:53,670
So fucking healthy.

2629
02:15:59,520 --> 02:16:00,640
Look at that.

2630
02:16:01,660 --> 02:16:03,120
We're figuring things out!

2631
02:16:05,980 --> 02:16:07,100
See, guys?

2632
02:16:07,220 --> 02:16:10,640
Every win we get, our synergy goes up by 0.1%.

2633
02:16:12,960 --> 02:16:15,480
It's just gonna take us like...

2634
02:16:15,480 --> 02:16:20,720
If we keep playing together for two more years, maybe this relationship is salvageable.

2635
02:16:32,680 --> 02:16:34,220
Maybe it's fixable.

2636
02:16:35,120 --> 02:16:36,920
Fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear.

2637
02:16:37,020 --> 02:16:38,240
Fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear.

2638
02:16:38,700 --> 02:16:40,680
Fear, fear, fear, fear, fear.

2639
02:16:40,880 --> 02:16:42,540
Fear, fear, fear, fear, fear.

2640
02:16:42,960 --> 02:16:43,940
Fear, fear, fear.

2641
02:16:45,720 --> 02:16:48,100
I fucking fucked it.

2642
02:16:48,480 --> 02:16:50,540
Three, two, one.

2643
02:16:52,860 --> 02:16:53,860
I have Magneto on me.

2644
02:16:54,720 --> 02:16:55,660
Magneto's one, Magneto's one.

2645
02:16:58,680 --> 02:17:00,340
Did you see that?

2646
02:17:00,740 --> 02:17:01,820
Did you see the target?

2647
02:17:07,280 --> 02:17:08,680
What the fuck was that?

2648
02:17:09,100 --> 02:17:13,420
We had three other people there, bunched up.

2649
02:17:13,440 --> 02:17:14,980
But don't fuck me, Angus.

2650
02:17:17,540 --> 02:17:19,500
Magneto warning me, bitch.

2651
02:17:19,540 --> 02:17:20,900
They're like, she's the weakest link.

2652
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:21,720
She's a streamer.

2653
02:17:23,020 --> 02:17:24,420
Guys, TimTheTatman is streaming.

2654
02:17:24,580 --> 02:17:25,700
Ninja's streaming, guys.

2655
02:17:25,960 --> 02:17:28,600
To all my stream snipers out there, Ninja's streaming.

2656
02:17:33,180 --> 02:17:35,400
Oh, I got juicy Ninja Qs.

2657
02:17:35,560 --> 02:17:35,860
Whoa!

2658
02:17:36,720 --> 02:17:40,380
Imagine those juicy Ninja Qs right now.

2659
02:17:45,980 --> 02:17:46,580
Oh...

2660
02:17:47,420 --> 02:17:48,720
Oh, die, me.

2661
02:17:50,460 --> 02:17:52,160
She's not flying.

2662
02:17:55,140 --> 02:17:56,020
No supports.

2663
02:18:00,810 --> 02:18:02,330
They're like, nice try, Doki.

2664
02:18:02,370 --> 02:18:03,430
We know your games.

2665
02:18:05,330 --> 02:18:06,450
Guys, oh my god.

2666
02:18:06,510 --> 02:18:09,130
Wouldn't it be so funny if you make Ninja rage?

2667
02:18:09,610 --> 02:18:11,110
Guys, you can't make me angry.

2668
02:18:11,210 --> 02:18:11,850
I just laugh.

2669
02:18:11,950 --> 02:18:12,750
It's not as funny.

2670
02:18:13,290 --> 02:18:13,710
It's not.

2671
02:18:15,970 --> 02:18:21,650
All I'm saying is that it's not as funny because I just laugh.

2672
02:18:27,450 --> 02:18:30,030
Oh my god.

2673
02:18:36,070 --> 02:18:38,610
Fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear.

2674
02:18:38,610 --> 02:18:38,850
Fear.

2675
02:18:40,210 --> 02:18:42,290
I fucking hate you.

2676
02:18:43,870 --> 02:18:44,850
Oh no.

2677
02:18:45,110 --> 02:18:45,690
I'm on Starlord.

2678
02:18:45,950 --> 02:18:46,510
And that's not a strange.

2679
02:18:46,510 --> 02:18:46,730
It's okay.

2680
02:18:51,840 --> 02:18:54,100
They were so thirsty.

2681
02:18:55,060 --> 02:18:56,620
I still can't eat.

2682
02:18:57,440 --> 02:18:59,660
I still can't.

2683
02:19:00,800 --> 02:19:01,780
I'm here.

2684
02:19:03,920 --> 02:19:06,880
Bro is trying to warn you that the fear is for you.

2685
02:19:07,480 --> 02:19:12,320
There were three people grouped up but he still went for you.

2686
02:19:12,580 --> 02:19:13,860
I told you.

2687
02:19:14,240 --> 02:19:16,820
I told you this is a hate crime.

2688
02:19:18,440 --> 02:19:20,140
What do I do?

2689
02:19:20,560 --> 02:19:21,820
What do I do?

2690
02:19:22,960 --> 02:19:24,440
Like, help me.

2691
02:19:25,140 --> 02:19:26,720
Thank you for the Twitch Prime.

2692
02:19:26,840 --> 02:19:27,200
Thank you.

2693
02:19:27,260 --> 02:19:28,180
Thank you.

2694
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:32,560
Oh my god.

2695
02:19:34,060 --> 02:19:34,620
You should farm.

2696
02:19:34,740 --> 02:19:36,980
Literally farming for YouTube content.

2697
02:19:37,280 --> 02:19:39,700
Instead of like my road to top 500.

2698
02:19:40,080 --> 02:19:43,520
It's like everybody wants this streamer dead.

2699
02:19:47,560 --> 02:19:48,680
My clickbait title.

2700
02:19:49,320 --> 02:19:52,260
Every Marvel Rivals player wants me out of Twitch.

2701
02:20:05,560 --> 02:20:06,400
Who's that for?

2702
02:20:06,680 --> 02:20:07,020
Me?

2703
02:20:07,960 --> 02:20:10,280
Your two people in your stack is me.

2704
02:20:11,220 --> 02:20:11,960
Oh yeah, shit.

2705
02:20:12,920 --> 02:20:14,260
I was like, me?

2706
02:20:14,600 --> 02:20:15,820
Oh, it's me.

2707
02:20:15,820 --> 02:20:17,180
It's me.

2708
02:20:21,940 --> 02:20:23,420
It is me.

2709
02:20:35,600 --> 02:20:37,500
There you go.

2710
02:20:37,600 --> 02:20:38,660
Here's another one.

2711
02:20:39,980 --> 02:20:41,460
Here's another one.

2712
02:20:43,700 --> 02:20:45,300
Here's another one.

2713
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:48,700
Here's another one.

2714
02:20:48,860 --> 02:20:49,860
Oh, it's gone now.

2715
02:20:55,070 --> 02:20:56,890
Did it work?

2716
02:20:57,990 --> 02:21:00,310
Guys, I don't think the strat worked.

2717
02:21:03,370 --> 02:21:04,650
Oh my god.

2718
02:21:04,750 --> 02:21:05,470
What the fuck?

2719
02:21:18,860 --> 02:21:20,680
Oh my god.

2720
02:21:27,220 --> 02:21:28,260
Oh my god.

2721
02:21:28,320 --> 02:21:29,140
The Runaan's.

2722
02:21:29,480 --> 02:21:29,900
Please.

2723
02:21:29,900 --> 02:21:29,960
Please.

2724
02:21:31,940 --> 02:21:34,120
You all require healing!

2725
02:21:40,240 --> 02:21:42,540
Oh my god.

2726
02:21:48,630 --> 02:21:50,350
Oh my god.

2727
02:21:51,270 --> 02:21:51,630
Here.

2728
02:21:58,250 --> 02:22:00,090
That was fast.

2729
02:22:00,990 --> 02:22:01,810
Oh my god.

2730
02:22:02,010 --> 02:22:02,490
Dance.

2731
02:22:03,470 --> 02:22:04,610
Dance, Doki.

2732
02:22:05,070 --> 02:22:05,910
Dance.

2733
02:22:08,190 --> 02:22:09,210
The whale.

2734
02:22:11,350 --> 02:22:11,910
Finally.

2735
02:22:12,630 --> 02:22:13,370
The one...

2736
02:22:13,370 --> 02:22:18,370
Guys, I forgot what it was like to be not 24-7 on a hit list.

2737
02:22:19,090 --> 02:22:20,090
That was like...

2738
02:22:20,090 --> 02:22:21,630
I think that was the first round.

2739
02:22:22,010 --> 02:22:24,230
I actually was not on a hit list there.

2740
02:22:24,370 --> 02:22:25,350
That's crazy.

2741
02:22:25,990 --> 02:22:27,210
And it was for half a round.

2742
02:22:27,430 --> 02:22:29,590
It was for half a round.

2743
02:22:30,090 --> 02:22:31,770
I was actually like...

2744
02:22:31,770 --> 02:22:32,530
Freedom.

2745
02:22:33,690 --> 02:22:34,650
I'm not on...

2746
02:22:34,650 --> 02:22:37,290
I'm not on some fucking list there.

2747
02:22:37,530 --> 02:22:38,950
That was insane.

2748
02:22:39,490 --> 02:22:41,290
That was actually insane.

2749
02:22:41,950 --> 02:22:44,710
I still can't believe it was like...

2750
02:22:44,710 --> 02:22:45,610
Hey, Magneto.

2751
02:22:45,810 --> 02:22:47,370
Who should you use your ult for?

2752
02:22:47,570 --> 02:22:49,470
The three people stacked up together?

2753
02:22:49,790 --> 02:22:52,590
Or this Luna player on the side.

2754
02:22:52,950 --> 02:22:55,190
That has a fucking building to cover her.

2755
02:23:01,370 --> 02:23:04,490
I wonder if it's also because...

2756
02:23:07,530 --> 02:23:09,890
I think it's also because they saw me running.

2757
02:23:10,350 --> 02:23:12,750
And they're just rubbing their hands together.

2758
02:23:13,010 --> 02:23:13,890
And they're like...

2759
02:23:13,890 --> 02:23:14,610
Vulnerable.

2760
02:23:17,230 --> 02:23:19,270
No one else runs away.

2761
02:23:19,410 --> 02:23:24,330
But because I get Stockholm Syndrome from all the...

2762
02:23:25,360 --> 02:23:28,490
From all the Magnetos targeting me.

2763
02:23:28,730 --> 02:23:30,510
That I just run at that point.

2764
02:23:31,190 --> 02:23:32,490
They're like...

2765
02:23:32,490 --> 02:23:34,270
This person fears me.

2766
02:23:37,670 --> 02:23:38,730
They're like...

2767
02:23:38,730 --> 02:23:39,690
She's running.

2768
02:23:40,810 --> 02:23:41,770
She's running.

2769
02:23:42,010 --> 02:23:43,390
She's weak.

2770
02:23:46,790 --> 02:23:48,770
The easy target.

2771
02:23:49,530 --> 02:23:50,430
Not Stockholm Syndrome.

2772
02:23:50,630 --> 02:23:52,130
Oh, what's the other word for it?

2773
02:23:52,530 --> 02:23:54,710
I think they realize how like...

2774
02:23:54,710 --> 02:23:55,350
How I've...

2775
02:23:55,350 --> 02:23:55,950
I Pavlov.

2776
02:23:56,130 --> 02:23:56,790
Yeah, Pavlov.

2777
02:23:56,950 --> 02:23:59,030
I Pavlov my way to just run after that.

2778
02:23:59,330 --> 02:24:01,370
Every time I hear Magneto say fear.

2779
02:24:08,410 --> 02:24:09,530
Yeah, conditioning.

2780
02:24:09,850 --> 02:24:10,990
Yeah, they condition me.

2781
02:24:15,750 --> 02:24:17,110
We're so back.

2782
02:24:17,370 --> 02:24:18,850
We're so back.

2783
02:24:18,970 --> 02:24:20,590
I can't believe I lost my OBS.

2784
02:24:20,870 --> 02:24:21,910
It literally disappeared.

2785
02:24:22,230 --> 02:24:23,470
I don't know where it went.

2786
02:24:24,850 --> 02:24:26,050
It's gone!

2787
02:24:27,130 --> 02:24:27,770
Like...

2788
02:24:27,770 --> 02:24:29,590
I don't have...

2789
02:24:29,590 --> 02:24:31,650
It says OBS is launched.

2790
02:24:31,870 --> 02:24:33,110
But it's gone.

2791
02:24:33,550 --> 02:24:34,590
Where did it go?

2792
02:24:36,810 --> 02:24:37,570
It's like...

2793
02:24:37,570 --> 02:24:39,010
I try to open it.

2794
02:24:39,090 --> 02:24:40,090
But they're like...

2795
02:24:40,090 --> 02:24:40,930
It's like...

2796
02:24:40,930 --> 02:24:41,890
Where did it go?

2797
02:24:42,890 --> 02:24:45,650
The OBS ran away.

2798
02:24:46,470 --> 02:24:48,290
How will I...

2799
02:24:53,510 --> 02:24:54,990
How do I do?

2800
02:24:55,410 --> 02:24:57,230
How do I end my stream?

2801
02:24:57,930 --> 02:25:01,650
How do I end my stream?

2802
02:25:03,850 --> 02:25:05,470
OBS here.

2803
02:25:09,510 --> 02:25:11,570
We're here forever.

2804
02:25:13,830 --> 02:25:16,010
I think I'm gonna go high ground here.

2805
02:25:16,190 --> 02:25:17,350
Try finding...

2806
02:25:17,350 --> 02:25:18,610
It's not in my task manager.

2807
02:25:18,910 --> 02:25:20,190
It's not in the apps.

2808
02:25:20,350 --> 02:25:21,790
It's in the background processes.

2809
02:25:22,150 --> 02:25:23,130
But I can't...

2810
02:25:23,130 --> 02:25:24,390
I can't bring it forward.

2811
02:25:24,490 --> 02:25:25,390
Because it's in the background.

2812
02:25:25,850 --> 02:25:27,170
It's just in the background.

2813
02:25:32,550 --> 02:25:34,330
He's opening a portal, guys.

2814
02:25:39,630 --> 02:25:40,090
Woah.

2815
02:25:45,570 --> 02:25:46,510
Yeah, I'm gonna go in.

2816
02:25:46,970 --> 02:25:47,750
Whatever they're looking for.

2817
02:25:49,610 --> 02:25:50,010
Woah!

2818
02:25:53,940 --> 02:25:54,340
Woah!

2819
02:25:56,420 --> 02:25:56,820
Goodbye.

2820
02:26:00,900 --> 02:26:03,340
Guys, I wish I can get headshots from down here.

2821
02:26:03,860 --> 02:26:06,460
Actually, I just wish I could get headshots in general.

2822
02:26:10,460 --> 02:26:11,760
Wait, there's people on the point.

2823
02:26:12,320 --> 02:26:13,060
There's two on point.

2824
02:26:17,370 --> 02:26:18,910
Wait, we never capped.

2825
02:26:28,540 --> 02:26:28,960
Hello.

2826
02:26:29,400 --> 02:26:30,540
Oh yeah, here we go.

2827
02:26:33,600 --> 02:26:35,080
Someone break this, please.

2828
02:26:35,180 --> 02:26:35,960
I'm too weak.

2829
02:26:36,680 --> 02:26:37,620
I'm so weak.

2830
02:26:41,080 --> 02:26:42,960
Somebody break this, please.

2831
02:26:44,600 --> 02:26:46,860
Our supports are not with you guys.

2832
02:26:48,340 --> 02:26:49,400
We're trying...

2833
02:26:49,400 --> 02:26:51,280
We're trying to break this thing.

2834
02:26:56,610 --> 02:26:57,170
Oh.

2835
02:26:59,330 --> 02:26:59,890
Alright,

2836
02:27:03,710 --> 02:27:04,410
I'm dead.

2837
02:27:05,550 --> 02:27:06,670
I'm dead.

2838
02:27:20,670 --> 02:27:21,530
We're just...

2839
02:27:21,530 --> 02:27:22,430
We're at one beat.

2840
02:27:22,610 --> 02:27:24,290
Sorry, the supports are trying to fight.

2841
02:27:24,290 --> 02:27:25,530
We shouldn't have fought a pillar.

2842
02:27:25,750 --> 02:27:28,590
I just saw Kurooba doing it.

2843
02:27:28,710 --> 02:27:29,750
So I was like...

2844
02:27:29,750 --> 02:27:32,250
That seems like what I should be doing, right?

2845
02:27:42,370 --> 02:27:43,550
I'm gonna ult this first.

2846
02:27:49,150 --> 02:27:50,070
I'm not on ult.

2847
02:27:51,330 --> 02:27:52,030
Oh shit.

2848
02:27:56,950 --> 02:27:58,770
There's a strange on me!

2849
02:28:00,550 --> 02:28:01,650
It's okay.

2850
02:28:03,910 --> 02:28:06,430
Oh, he's fucking low too.

2851
02:28:08,900 --> 02:28:12,070
I need to save mine for a Starlord ult.

2852
02:28:12,110 --> 02:28:14,310
I forgot the Starlord existed, not gonna lie.

2853
02:28:14,890 --> 02:28:17,430
I legitimately forgot Starlord.

2854
02:28:20,060 --> 02:28:22,670
I didn't realize the Starlord was around.

2855
02:28:25,070 --> 02:28:26,030
Oh no.

2856
02:28:28,330 --> 02:28:29,490
Oh my god.

2857
02:28:30,830 --> 02:28:33,190
He did not exist for me.

2858
02:28:36,890 --> 02:28:38,070
Jesus Christ.

2859
02:28:38,910 --> 02:28:40,350
Oh no, not the Hulk.

2860
02:28:40,950 --> 02:28:41,630
Oh no.

2861
02:28:42,770 --> 02:28:43,510
Oh no.

2862
02:28:45,830 --> 02:28:46,850
Oh no.

2863
02:28:49,890 --> 02:28:50,790
He's low.

2864
02:28:50,910 --> 02:28:51,170
He's half.

2865
02:28:51,230 --> 02:28:51,410
He's half.

2866
02:28:51,430 --> 02:28:51,710
He's half.

2867
02:28:53,850 --> 02:28:56,310
There's an Iron Man above us.

2868
02:29:00,660 --> 02:29:02,340
Oh no, he made him mad.

2869
02:29:06,590 --> 02:29:07,530
Oh no.

2870
02:29:11,050 --> 02:29:12,310
Oh my god.

2871
02:29:16,630 --> 02:29:18,030
He's trying to get to you.

2872
02:29:21,470 --> 02:29:22,790
I have a Hulk on me.

2873
02:29:28,030 --> 02:29:28,650
I'm on.

2874
02:29:29,010 --> 02:29:29,490
I'm ulting.

2875
02:29:29,570 --> 02:29:29,930
I'm ulting him.

2876
02:29:34,420 --> 02:29:35,200
I'm asleep.

2877
02:29:35,500 --> 02:29:35,940
I'm asleep.

2878
02:29:38,960 --> 02:29:39,820
Let's change one.

2879
02:29:39,920 --> 02:29:40,300
Let's change one.

2880
02:29:45,200 --> 02:29:47,400
Oh my god, they're gonna have Starlord ult though.

2881
02:29:47,760 --> 02:29:56,430
Oh my god, they have Starlord ult though.

2882
02:29:57,930 --> 02:29:59,970
They have Starlord ult so I'm a little scared.

2883
02:30:06,430 --> 02:30:06,970
Fear.

2884
02:30:14,290 --> 02:30:14,890
There he is.

2885
02:30:14,990 --> 02:30:15,130
There he is.

2886
02:30:15,170 --> 02:30:15,450
One point.

2887
02:30:22,510 --> 02:30:28,570
Iron Man's one, bro.

2888
02:30:28,730 --> 02:30:29,270
Iron Man's one.

2889
02:30:30,290 --> 02:30:31,050
He's not one anymore.

2890
02:30:31,190 --> 02:30:31,710
He's not one.

2891
02:30:36,990 --> 02:30:39,030
I didn't know where he was.

2892
02:30:39,110 --> 02:30:40,010
What do you mean?

2893
02:30:43,830 --> 02:30:44,630
I slept...

2894
02:30:46,570 --> 02:30:47,810
Oh, I can't.

2895
02:30:49,210 --> 02:30:50,390
I was like, where?

2896
02:30:54,030 --> 02:30:55,630
Where do you mean?

2897
02:30:59,890 --> 02:31:01,390
When he was like, where is he?

2898
02:31:01,450 --> 02:31:02,370
I was like, what?

2899
02:31:05,490 --> 02:31:06,890
What do you mean?

2900
02:31:11,900 --> 02:31:13,100
Where is the Iron Man?

2901
02:31:13,160 --> 02:31:13,480
I know.

2902
02:31:13,580 --> 02:31:14,880
I was like, where is he?

2903
02:31:18,700 --> 02:31:20,640
Wait, where is he?

2904
02:31:23,800 --> 02:31:26,200
Yeah, when he was ulted you didn't look at him?

2905
02:31:27,160 --> 02:31:27,800
Where?

2906
02:31:36,140 --> 02:31:37,880
Please ping the Iron Man.

2907
02:31:37,960 --> 02:31:42,000
I even looked up and gamers normally don't look up.

2908
02:31:42,320 --> 02:31:45,920
I just did the impossible and I still couldn't find him.

2909
02:31:48,820 --> 02:31:49,940
Also, hello, Rod!

2910
02:31:50,040 --> 02:31:50,700
Thank you for the raid!

2911
02:31:50,860 --> 02:31:51,380
Thank you!

2912
02:31:51,420 --> 02:31:51,860
Hello, everybody!

2913
02:31:51,940 --> 02:31:52,820
My name is Doki Bird.

2914
02:31:52,960 --> 02:31:53,560
Hello, everybody.

2915
02:31:53,780 --> 02:31:54,600
My name is Markiplier.

2916
02:31:54,660 --> 02:31:54,900
Sorry.

2917
02:31:55,160 --> 02:31:55,600
Hello, everyone!

2918
02:31:55,700 --> 02:31:56,740
My name is Doki Bird.

2919
02:31:57,100 --> 02:32:00,280
I used to stream on YouTube, but now I'm getting stream sniped on Twitch, so let's go!

2920
02:32:05,600 --> 02:32:06,320
Let's go!

2921
02:32:06,720 --> 02:32:12,120
So I'm on Twitch because I want to get stream sniped to oblivion and donate my points to the cause.

2922
02:32:13,120 --> 02:32:13,720
They TP'd.

2923
02:32:13,720 --> 02:32:14,240
They TP'd.

2924
02:32:14,380 --> 02:32:15,400
I'm flanking them right now.

2925
02:32:16,660 --> 02:32:18,380
I'm gonna go right side.

2926
02:32:24,840 --> 02:32:26,040
Alright, here we go.

2927
02:32:34,330 --> 02:32:34,790
Wait, what?

2928
02:32:41,790 --> 02:32:43,150
Oh my god.

2929
02:32:47,950 --> 02:32:49,530
I'm sorry, I can't focus!

2930
02:32:50,150 --> 02:32:50,750
I can't!

2931
02:32:51,630 --> 02:32:52,630
Hulk is low!

2932
02:32:52,850 --> 02:32:53,290
Hulk is low!

2933
02:32:56,410 --> 02:32:57,450
I'm sorry!

2934
02:33:00,990 --> 02:33:01,800
I'm on Ironman!

2935
02:33:10,390 --> 02:33:12,750
You're in this spot!

2936
02:33:13,450 --> 02:33:14,010
I love it!

2937
02:33:14,050 --> 02:33:15,310
He's so over it!

2938
02:33:15,650 --> 02:33:17,330
He was so over it!

2939
02:33:18,090 --> 02:33:19,190
Oh my god.

2940
02:33:19,250 --> 02:33:20,470
I couldn't focus there.

2941
02:33:23,170 --> 02:33:24,410
I'm sorry.

2942
02:33:25,210 --> 02:33:27,890
We lost that fight because of that.

2943
02:33:27,990 --> 02:33:28,510
I'm sorry.

2944
02:33:28,670 --> 02:33:29,850
It was just so funny.

2945
02:33:31,670 --> 02:33:37,550
That was like the fucking cry of like, I hate my DPS players.

2946
02:33:41,460 --> 02:33:43,680
I think it was Korova.

2947
02:33:43,800 --> 02:33:44,700
I'm pretty sure.

2948
02:33:45,220 --> 02:33:48,100
I'm pretty sure it was Korova that said that.

2949
02:33:49,440 --> 02:33:52,700
That was like the cry of, I'm so over it.

2950
02:34:04,500 --> 02:34:06,420
Bro, I can't get these heals.

2951
02:34:06,580 --> 02:34:07,940
I'm 1v6ing.

2952
02:34:08,240 --> 02:34:09,920
Bro, where the fuck's my heals?

2953
02:34:10,340 --> 02:34:11,780
There's Starlight Turret left.

2954
02:34:28,220 --> 02:34:28,960
I'm ulting.

2955
02:34:34,810 --> 02:34:36,030
No you don't.

2956
02:34:36,250 --> 02:34:36,870
No you don't.

2957
02:34:37,010 --> 02:34:37,590
No you...

2958
02:34:37,590 --> 02:34:38,390
Where?

2959
02:34:43,250 --> 02:34:44,210
Who's we?

2960
02:34:45,550 --> 02:34:47,410
I'm waiting for leaves.

2961
02:34:49,690 --> 02:34:53,070
I'm waiting for my leave cooldown, please!

2962
02:34:58,850 --> 02:34:59,290
Yes!

2963
02:35:00,650 --> 02:35:03,850
Every win our synergy goes up by 0.1%!

2964
02:35:04,030 --> 02:35:04,650
It's working!

2965
02:35:12,610 --> 02:35:13,910
We're doing it!

2966
02:35:15,230 --> 02:35:15,890
Oh, it's not over.

2967
02:35:15,970 --> 02:35:16,470
Oh, it's not over.

2968
02:35:16,830 --> 02:35:18,570
I know, we lost the first one, dude.

2969
02:35:24,090 --> 02:35:25,050
Welcome, raiders.

2970
02:35:25,270 --> 02:35:26,290
Welcome, welcome.

2971
02:35:26,330 --> 02:35:27,910
SushiCat, thank you for the Twitch Prime!

2972
02:35:28,050 --> 02:35:28,990
Thank you!

2973
02:35:30,190 --> 02:35:31,150
Oh my god.

2974
02:35:32,070 --> 02:35:33,210
Only 0.1%.

2975
02:35:33,210 --> 02:35:34,010
Yeah, only 0.1%.

2976
02:35:34,010 --> 02:35:35,610
We're at 0.2% right now.

2977
02:35:35,890 --> 02:35:37,750
0.02% actually.

2978
02:35:38,870 --> 02:35:40,270
It's 0.01%.

2979
02:35:40,270 --> 02:35:42,410
Every win is 0.01%.

2980
02:35:46,070 --> 02:35:47,270
I told you!

2981
02:35:47,270 --> 02:35:48,310
You got TP this time?

2982
02:35:49,730 --> 02:35:51,110
I shouldn't say that.

2983
02:35:51,450 --> 02:35:53,590
I go to therapy sometimes.

2984
02:35:56,770 --> 02:35:57,930
It's not a scam.

2985
02:35:58,110 --> 02:36:00,110
Guys, you just gotta find the right therapist.

2986
02:36:00,710 --> 02:36:03,010
But counseling therapy is a scam.

2987
02:36:03,390 --> 02:36:04,090
That's right.

2988
02:36:04,370 --> 02:36:06,830
If the relationship is over, fuck it, just end it.

2989
02:36:07,310 --> 02:36:08,410
I mean, but it's fixable.

2990
02:36:08,630 --> 02:36:13,370
But like, no, no, Kurobo and I, our support synergy is fixable.

2991
02:36:15,490 --> 02:36:16,310
Synergy is fixable.

2992
02:36:17,270 --> 02:36:18,830
Put it on them, put it on them.

2993
02:36:19,870 --> 02:36:21,030
Yeah, I'm going on top of them.

2994
02:36:21,250 --> 02:36:22,490
Tell me when though, tell me when though, tell me when though.

2995
02:36:22,670 --> 02:36:23,370
I got it right now, I got it right now.

2996
02:36:25,350 --> 02:36:28,430
Guys, I don't think he... Oh my god!

2997
02:36:29,010 --> 02:36:30,550
What the fuck?

2998
02:36:33,750 --> 02:36:35,450
What hap... What happened?

2999
02:36:36,370 --> 02:36:36,630
What?

3000
02:36:40,510 --> 02:36:41,350
Okay, let's go.

3001
02:36:44,070 --> 02:36:44,590
What happened?

3002
02:36:47,270 --> 02:36:48,470
I know, I was so surprised.

3003
02:36:48,530 --> 02:36:49,690
Oh, I shouldn't have done that.

3004
02:36:50,130 --> 02:36:51,750
I was... I shouldn't have cocooned.

3005
02:36:51,870 --> 02:36:54,290
I was so surprised I accidentally left clicked.

3006
02:36:54,670 --> 02:36:57,870
I was... I was so surprised.

3007
02:36:59,490 --> 02:37:04,750
I was not ex... I don't know, I just... I was not expecting it.

3008
02:37:04,770 --> 02:37:07,070
It like surprised me so much.

3009
02:37:07,790 --> 02:37:16,610
Like, it was such a weird ass fucking kill.

3010
02:37:17,270 --> 02:37:18,830
I slept Hog.

3011
02:37:21,770 --> 02:37:24,210
I don't have ult for that.

3012
02:37:25,990 --> 02:37:26,710
I can't peek.

3013
02:37:41,490 --> 02:37:43,590
Oh my god.

3014
02:37:45,390 --> 02:37:46,230
Okay.

3015
02:37:47,010 --> 02:37:47,230
Oh!

3016
02:37:47,230 --> 02:37:47,910
Oh!

3017
02:37:52,650 --> 02:37:54,350
Oh my god, that was crazy.

3018
02:37:58,050 --> 02:37:59,210
I can ult this in here.

3019
02:38:03,250 --> 02:38:04,030
Alright, let's go.

3020
02:38:08,950 --> 02:38:09,670
Stop laughing.

3021
02:38:10,290 --> 02:38:10,810
Okay, I'm gonna ult.

3022
02:38:16,390 --> 02:38:17,730
I have a strange on me.

3023
02:38:19,210 --> 02:38:21,050
I... I don't see you, I don't see you.

3024
02:38:24,310 --> 02:38:25,710
I'm... I healed you.

3025
02:38:28,890 --> 02:38:30,190
I'm on... I'm on the strange.

3026
02:38:30,330 --> 02:38:30,790
I'm on the strange.

3027
02:38:32,010 --> 02:38:32,770
Strange is one.

3028
02:38:32,890 --> 02:38:33,350
Strange is one.

3029
02:38:34,670 --> 02:38:35,870
Strange is actually solo.

3030
02:38:36,590 --> 02:38:37,630
I'm really... Oh, there's Sylar.

3031
02:38:37,750 --> 02:38:38,530
There's Sylar behind us.

3032
02:38:40,790 --> 02:38:40,990
Oh!

3033
02:38:44,430 --> 02:38:47,690
I don't have leaves.

3034
02:38:48,270 --> 02:38:49,370
I have a strange on me too.

3035
02:38:51,890 --> 02:38:52,770
I'm cocooning.

3036
02:38:57,050 --> 02:38:58,750
I have a strange left.

3037
02:39:01,170 --> 02:39:02,270
There's a... There's a strange.

3038
02:39:02,390 --> 02:39:02,670
There's a strange.

3039
02:39:05,690 --> 02:39:06,970
There's a strange on point.

3040
02:39:10,950 --> 02:39:11,390
Please!

3041
02:39:13,730 --> 02:39:15,230
Oh my god!

3042
02:39:20,890 --> 02:39:22,710
I was like, get on point!

3043
02:39:23,070 --> 02:39:24,250
Strange is on the point!

3044
02:39:24,330 --> 02:39:25,130
What do you want me to do?!

3045
02:39:29,430 --> 02:39:31,830
I was like, guys!

3046
02:39:32,250 --> 02:39:33,770
What about strange?

3047
02:39:35,750 --> 02:39:41,290
What about the one character that's on the point?

3048
02:39:42,330 --> 02:39:45,190
Oh my god, isn't that silly?

3049
02:39:46,190 --> 02:39:47,830
That's so... I'm ulting.

3050
02:39:48,090 --> 02:39:48,870
Get on... near me.

3051
02:39:51,110 --> 02:39:52,290
Oh my god.

3052
02:39:53,490 --> 02:39:55,250
I'm with our... I'm with our Adam.

3053
02:40:00,360 --> 02:40:03,960
I don't have... I'm dead.

3054
02:40:04,200 --> 02:40:06,060
I'm dead.

3055
02:40:07,180 --> 02:40:09,440
Did I... Am I gonna... I'm gonna...

3056
02:40:09,440 --> 02:40:11,160
Oh no.

3057
02:40:12,720 --> 02:40:14,260
I slept him.

3058
02:40:18,790 --> 02:40:19,470
No!

3059
02:40:19,850 --> 02:40:20,810
Let me live!

3060
02:40:26,430 --> 02:40:28,570
Are we gonna get there?

3061
02:40:29,770 --> 02:40:31,810
I don't... I don't know.

3062
02:40:31,810 --> 02:40:34,890
He got a touch.

3063
02:40:35,490 --> 02:40:35,830
No!

3064
02:40:45,310 --> 02:40:48,710
Why did he spaz on that ult?

3065
02:40:49,710 --> 02:40:51,830
Rest in peace, all of our friends.

3066
02:40:55,130 --> 02:40:56,350
Oh my god, rest in peace.

3067
02:40:56,750 --> 02:40:57,730
How did he miss?

3068
02:40:57,930 --> 02:40:59,610
They were right in front of them.

3069
02:41:01,290 --> 02:41:01,890
That's true.

3070
02:41:02,930 --> 02:41:03,330
True.

3071
02:41:03,570 --> 02:41:06,530
The thing is, they have like a million shields.

3072
02:41:07,890 --> 02:41:11,850
They had... We also had like one guy who doesn't play strange that was on strange.

3073
02:41:11,930 --> 02:41:13,370
So he was like uncomfortable too.

3074
02:41:13,450 --> 02:41:15,750
So it's like, you know, it is what it is.

3075
02:41:23,170 --> 02:41:27,110
Okay, we sort of like... I also got a bit distracted in...

3076
02:41:28,710 --> 02:41:41,190
I also got like a bit distracted there when our other support literally screamed at our Ironman being like, you're in their spot!

3077
02:41:43,150 --> 02:41:47,230
I'm the team 1v6 and missed every ult.

3078
02:41:48,070 --> 02:41:52,070
That... That was... I couldn't focus.

3079
02:41:52,330 --> 02:41:54,570
I couldn't... It was so hard to lock back in.

3080
02:41:54,610 --> 02:41:55,550
It was so good.

3081
02:41:55,550 --> 02:42:00,310
I was just like, that's the support player right there.

3082
02:42:00,570 --> 02:42:05,350
That was... That's a... That's a support player.

3083
02:42:09,230 --> 02:42:11,470
I thought he disappeared.

3084
02:42:12,010 --> 02:42:14,670
BabyBae was like... Was an Overwatch player.

3085
02:42:15,210 --> 02:42:19,090
For like... When Overwatch first came out and he was like pretty well known.

3086
02:42:19,270 --> 02:42:20,570
And then he just disappeared.

3087
02:42:20,770 --> 02:42:22,690
I never expected to see him back.

3088
02:42:23,730 --> 02:42:33,690
I see so many players that were like gone-gone for so long and then they just came back for Overwatch.

3089
02:42:33,970 --> 02:42:35,050
It's crazy.

3090
02:42:35,970 --> 02:42:38,670
BabyBae, he's a... What was he known for?

3091
02:42:39,110 --> 02:42:41,490
He was known for being incredibly toxic.

3092
02:42:44,350 --> 02:42:46,290
But I think he's reformed.

3093
02:42:46,330 --> 02:42:47,650
He got older, you know?

3094
02:42:48,390 --> 02:42:49,230
He got older.

3095
02:42:49,530 --> 02:42:51,050
He's reformed now.

3096
02:42:51,050 --> 02:42:56,850
Like... Like he mellowed out.

3097
02:42:57,750 --> 02:42:59,770
Like he could've said worse things.

3098
02:43:00,270 --> 02:43:02,850
He has said worse things in Overwatch.

3099
02:43:03,490 --> 02:43:06,710
But like he... Clearly he seemed like he got better.

3100
02:43:07,310 --> 02:43:09,770
This is... Yeah, this is technically mellowed out.

3101
02:43:09,830 --> 02:43:14,250
I remember back in the Overwatch BabyBae area.

3102
02:43:16,650 --> 02:43:19,070
It was a lot worse.

3103
02:43:19,170 --> 02:43:19,910
It was a lot worse.

3104
02:43:21,710 --> 02:43:25,490
This is the norm endorsement you think this is.

3105
02:43:28,190 --> 02:43:31,270
I'm bronze and never whiffed a pulse charge that hard.

3106
02:43:31,510 --> 02:43:34,850
Okay, but like when you're in bronze they don't know what to...

3107
02:43:34,850 --> 02:43:42,090
Okay, but like when you're there in bronze the players have like... Don't have the fucking game sense to dodge.

3108
02:43:42,770 --> 02:43:46,870
Don't have the game se... Yeah, bronze players don't move, guys.

3109
02:43:47,510 --> 02:43:49,550
Bronze players don't move.

3110
02:43:53,570 --> 02:43:54,570
I'm sorry.

3111
02:43:54,730 --> 02:43:55,290
I'm sorry.

3112
02:43:55,450 --> 02:43:58,690
If they wish to stop queue at any moment, I understand.

3113
02:43:59,750 --> 02:44:01,190
I understand my teammates.

3114
02:44:02,550 --> 02:44:07,190
It's been... It's been a very rough session and I understand.

3115
02:44:07,550 --> 02:44:09,130
But at least we're having fun, right?

3116
02:44:09,150 --> 02:44:10,530
At least chat's having fun.

3117
02:44:10,930 --> 02:44:12,870
I'm sort of having... I'm having fun.

3118
02:44:13,810 --> 02:44:15,510
I'm having fun too.

3119
02:44:16,450 --> 02:44:19,390
But like... I told them they're allowed to leave whenever.

3120
02:44:24,330 --> 02:44:26,030
Because I understand.

3121
02:44:28,770 --> 02:44:30,770
And yeah, that's fine.

3122
02:44:30,870 --> 02:44:31,890
I'm okay with that.

3123
02:44:32,250 --> 02:44:33,110
I know my place.

3124
02:44:33,570 --> 02:44:35,310
I know my place in the world.

3125
02:44:39,550 --> 02:44:40,970
I signed up for the circus.

3126
02:44:41,370 --> 02:44:42,170
We're all here.

3127
02:44:43,010 --> 02:44:44,330
We're all here.

3128
02:44:46,550 --> 02:44:54,630
If I was... I mean... I... If I really, really wanted to like act at climb, I'd do it off stream.

3129
02:44:54,770 --> 02:44:55,550
Yeah, that's true.

3130
02:44:56,330 --> 02:44:59,570
But also like, I know you guys enjoy watching the climb too.

3131
02:44:59,670 --> 02:45:05,130
Because I feel like if I do make it... If I do make it, it's so much more satisfying, you know?

3132
02:45:06,550 --> 02:45:10,970
It's so much more satisfying to accomplish it on stream.

3133
02:45:11,330 --> 02:45:14,470
After, you know, getting hate crime for the last week.

3134
02:45:17,530 --> 02:45:24,230
After getting fucking hate crime for the last week, it feels like I'm literally going against God.

3135
02:45:24,690 --> 02:45:28,450
Fighting a war against God right now, trying to get top 500.

3136
02:45:28,810 --> 02:45:33,190
He's sending everything possible to get in my way by being on stream.

3137
02:45:33,190 --> 02:45:40,130
Like, I'm literally... I literally got hit list by a fucking first place team in this Marble Rivals tournament.

3138
02:45:45,910 --> 02:45:52,450
I literally was on a... I got hit list by the number one team in Marble Rivals.

3139
02:45:52,830 --> 02:45:55,010
I know my place.

3140
02:45:55,590 --> 02:45:56,150
I...

3141
02:46:00,350 --> 02:46:00,910
Huh?

3142
02:46:03,410 --> 02:46:04,950
I'll support you regardless.

3143
02:46:05,370 --> 02:46:08,130
How much damage does Mantis do?

3144
02:46:08,230 --> 02:46:08,650
I don't know.

3145
02:46:08,750 --> 02:46:10,230
You should watch a video for that.

3146
02:46:13,090 --> 02:46:14,710
I just play the game.

3147
02:46:15,050 --> 02:46:16,970
I just know it does more damage.

3148
02:46:17,470 --> 02:46:22,870
I don't even know how... I remember like, when I used to play Overwatch a lot.

3149
02:46:22,870 --> 02:46:28,090
And I was known for my over... Oh, for Overwatch and Apex stuff, people would ask me these questions.

3150
02:46:28,910 --> 02:46:31,610
They're like, how much damage does an R9 do per shot?

3151
02:46:31,650 --> 02:46:32,970
And I'm like, I don't fucking know.

3152
02:46:33,050 --> 02:46:34,490
I just know it does a lot of damage.

3153
02:46:34,710 --> 02:46:35,190
Like, what?

3154
02:46:39,670 --> 02:46:45,230
I would have... because I used to be known as... I used to be really, really good at R9.

3155
02:46:45,790 --> 02:46:49,010
Like, I still am, but R9 gets nerfed so much in Apex.

3156
02:46:49,010 --> 02:46:51,330
But like, so it's not a good gun anymore.

3157
02:46:51,550 --> 02:46:55,490
But when it was like, the gun, I was like, a monster on it.

3158
02:46:55,750 --> 02:46:57,510
Because I have really good tracking skills.

3159
02:46:57,910 --> 02:47:04,010
And then like, people would ask me, they're like, how much shots does a one R9 bullet do to a head?

3160
02:47:04,350 --> 02:47:06,310
And I was like, bro, do you think I fucking care?

3161
02:47:06,470 --> 02:47:09,470
Like, as long as the person dies, that's all that matters.

3162
02:47:11,950 --> 02:47:12,390
Like...

3163
02:47:12,390 --> 02:47:15,630
They die, next question.

3164
02:47:18,370 --> 02:47:19,710
They just die.

3165
02:47:20,010 --> 02:47:23,750
And then like, but the thing is, like, I was talking to like, pro players about it.

3166
02:47:23,870 --> 02:47:25,570
And they're like, you don't know?

3167
02:47:26,030 --> 02:47:27,550
It does blah, blah, blah, damage.

3168
02:47:27,750 --> 02:47:28,510
I'm like, what?

3169
02:47:29,570 --> 02:47:31,550
I'm sorry, I live outside the game.

3170
02:47:33,470 --> 02:47:33,930
Like...

3171
02:47:33,930 --> 02:47:37,090
I'm sorry, I have a career outside of Apex.

3172
02:47:37,390 --> 02:47:38,130
I'm sorry.

3173
02:47:38,490 --> 02:47:39,850
Like, I'm sorry.

3174
02:47:39,910 --> 02:47:44,350
Oh, sue me, I don't know what the damage is for one fucking bullet.

3175
02:47:44,350 --> 02:47:44,930
Like...

3176
02:47:49,050 --> 02:47:54,930
They do, pro players know like, what the damage is for like, each shot and stuff.

3177
02:47:56,570 --> 02:47:58,870
So like, I'm fucking nerds.

3178
02:47:58,910 --> 02:47:59,270
Nerd!

3179
02:48:01,070 --> 02:48:05,790
I don't touch grass, but like, I have a life outside of it.

3180
02:48:07,690 --> 02:48:08,850
Like, nerds!

3181
02:48:09,970 --> 02:48:12,390
I just want the gun, give me... exactly.

3182
02:48:14,010 --> 02:48:14,530
Exactly.

3183
02:48:18,260 --> 02:48:21,560
I have a dog and I'm contractually obligated to touch grass.

3184
02:48:21,580 --> 02:48:22,100
That too.

3185
02:48:23,620 --> 02:48:24,460
That too.

3186
02:48:26,720 --> 02:48:29,760
Honestly, I'm glad I have a dog so I can actually go outside.

3187
02:48:29,840 --> 02:48:33,620
I think if I didn't have Dirky Amber Doge, my...

3188
02:48:33,620 --> 02:48:35,960
I would never see the sun.

3189
02:48:36,400 --> 02:48:38,880
I would actually never see the sun.

3190
02:48:40,600 --> 02:48:45,260
If like, he was... if he never existed in my life.

3191
02:48:46,660 --> 02:48:48,000
I need to start eating pills.

3192
02:48:48,180 --> 02:48:50,240
Like, those like, supplements.

3193
02:48:50,840 --> 02:48:52,100
Not like, bad pills.

3194
02:48:52,200 --> 02:48:53,980
I meant like, vitamin pills.

3195
02:48:54,820 --> 02:49:02,600
I need to start... I need to start actually taking like, supplements and stuff because I feel like...

3196
02:49:04,340 --> 02:49:08,420
I feel like I'm like... I definitely need more vitamin.

3197
02:49:08,920 --> 02:49:10,440
Vitamins in my system.

3198
02:49:12,720 --> 02:49:13,900
Vitamins are pills!

3199
02:49:14,340 --> 02:49:15,360
Aren't they just pills?

3200
02:49:17,340 --> 02:49:18,840
They're like pills, right?

3201
02:49:21,980 --> 02:49:25,560
Dirky, the word is vitamins, but they're also pills, aren't they?

3202
02:49:27,540 --> 02:49:29,520
I should get some scummies too.

3203
02:49:29,640 --> 02:49:31,240
Aren't there gummies that actually do stuff?

3204
02:49:32,600 --> 02:49:35,020
There's gummies, like the Flintstones ones.

3205
02:49:36,060 --> 02:49:38,420
There's like, non-children versions of it.

3206
02:49:40,160 --> 02:49:40,560
I don't know.

3207
02:49:40,640 --> 02:49:43,640
Sometimes I don't know if gummies are like, a scam or not.

3208
02:49:45,100 --> 02:49:46,900
Gamer gummies are definitely a scam.

3209
02:49:47,540 --> 02:49:50,980
I think if you put gamer in front of anything, it's just a scam.

3210
02:49:53,080 --> 02:49:55,500
Wait, but not GamerSubs!

3211
02:49:55,980 --> 02:49:57,120
GamerSubs is different!

3212
02:49:59,680 --> 02:50:02,740
I'm drinking GamerSubs right now, guys!

3213
02:50:03,360 --> 02:50:08,960
If anything, GamerSubs is not a scam because I'm drinking GamerSubs right now!

3214
02:50:09,280 --> 02:50:15,280
If you use my code, DIRKYBIRD, you get 10% off, off of every purchase.

3215
02:50:17,620 --> 02:50:18,960
DIRKY, you scam!

3216
02:50:19,340 --> 02:50:22,580
Okay, but I've seen gamer gummies and I think that's a scam.

3217
02:50:22,780 --> 02:50:24,320
Just buy regular gummies.

3218
02:50:24,760 --> 02:50:28,200
And buy it at bulk in Costco, because it's cheaper.

3219
02:50:29,820 --> 02:50:35,440
I feel like... If I know what's not a scam, GamerSubs.

3220
02:50:37,160 --> 02:50:38,600
You know what was a happy surprise yesterday?

3221
02:50:38,840 --> 02:50:42,720
Knowing that Space King episode 2 came out.

3222
02:50:42,720 --> 02:50:44,360
I fucking love Flash Gitz.

3223
02:50:44,720 --> 02:50:47,440
You can tell what my humor is like because of it.

3224
02:50:48,320 --> 02:50:51,620
Guys, if you guys didn't know, Space King episode 2 came out.

3225
02:50:51,760 --> 02:50:52,680
It was a good episode.

3226
02:50:52,860 --> 02:50:54,180
I liked it very much.

3227
02:50:57,540 --> 02:51:00,040
Do you know what's not a scam?

3228
02:51:00,180 --> 02:51:01,940
My sponsor, exactly.

3229
02:51:03,500 --> 02:51:04,600
It was.

3230
02:51:04,740 --> 02:51:12,540
I like how they want to make money, and they're tired of getting Warhammer-ed suit, I guess.

3231
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:14,660
Because they want original content.

3232
02:51:14,740 --> 02:51:20,200
They want to make money and make merch and stuff, but they can't do that off of parody content.

3233
02:51:20,700 --> 02:51:26,820
So they just literally made Space Marines 2.

3234
02:51:27,600 --> 02:51:31,320
But what if... But they call it Space King.

3235
02:51:34,650 --> 02:51:36,530
Which I thought was really funny.

3236
02:51:38,910 --> 02:51:40,370
I'm not a gamer, girl.

3237
02:51:40,510 --> 02:51:41,870
I'm just a gamer.

3238
02:51:49,300 --> 02:51:52,020
You guys hear that Notch announced Minecraft 2?

3239
02:51:53,360 --> 02:51:54,700
Like, that's crazy.

3240
02:51:55,320 --> 02:51:59,500
He basically announced... He announced Minecraft 2.

3241
02:52:00,480 --> 02:52:02,180
I don't know where he announced that.

3242
02:52:02,240 --> 02:52:06,740
I literally just saw my Twitter being like, Minecraft 2 is actually gonna come out!

3243
02:52:07,780 --> 02:52:09,940
And then Notch was like, yeah, Minecraft 2.

3244
02:52:10,040 --> 02:52:13,660
I'm like, how do you make 2 of Minecraft?

3245
02:52:15,680 --> 02:52:16,820
He's still alive?

3246
02:52:16,940 --> 02:52:23,700
Yeah, because he sold Minecraft to Microsoft, so technically he's not allowed to make a second Minecraft.

3247
02:52:24,200 --> 02:52:30,300
So I'm pretty sure he's just gonna be like... It's gonna be Minecraft, but Notch owns it again.

3248
02:52:30,300 --> 02:52:37,780
But when Notch owned Minecraft, there were no updates, so I'm just... I don't know.

3249
02:52:39,520 --> 02:52:40,280
I don't know.

3250
02:52:40,920 --> 02:52:46,720
There were barely updates when he owned Minecraft, so I don't know what he's gonna do.

3251
02:52:49,140 --> 02:52:49,700
True!

3252
02:52:53,240 --> 02:52:59,740
It's just basically him talking about his next project, but like, trying to be like, it's Minecraft 2!

3253
02:52:59,860 --> 02:53:01,700
But legally, it's not Minecraft 2.

3254
02:53:02,880 --> 02:53:03,980
Like, legally.

3255
02:53:04,180 --> 02:53:06,100
It's just Minecraft, but owned by Notch again.

3256
02:53:15,050 --> 02:53:19,710
How did we get Minecraft 2 before Silkside?

3257
02:53:24,260 --> 02:53:27,840
And legally distinct Minecraft 2.

3258
02:53:28,960 --> 02:53:33,820
It's gonna... Oh my god, I actually backed the Kickstarter for Cube World!

3259
02:53:34,420 --> 02:53:38,020
I'm so stoked to mention Cube World in this household.

3260
02:53:38,680 --> 02:53:41,940
I actually backed it.

3261
02:53:45,360 --> 02:53:46,780
So did I.

3262
02:53:49,580 --> 02:53:51,100
What the fuck is Cube World?

3263
02:53:51,340 --> 02:53:56,340
Cube World was gonna be like, RPG Minecraft, and then like, it died.

3264
02:53:57,080 --> 02:53:58,160
I was so sad.

3265
02:54:02,800 --> 02:54:06,140
All that... Yeah, all that squandered potential, I agree.

3266
02:54:06,640 --> 02:54:11,960
I feel like it definitely could've... It definitely could've been like, a really good game.

3267
02:54:12,580 --> 02:54:15,060
If they weren't stuck in development hell.

3268
02:54:15,060 --> 02:54:22,260
And then the developers got really depressed because people hated where it was going, and then they literally just stopped developing it.

3269
02:54:22,980 --> 02:54:28,940
So it's like... So like, you know, nothing came out of it.

3270
02:54:37,210 --> 02:54:39,730
Yeah, it was like, literally like, RPG.

3271
02:54:41,030 --> 02:54:41,990
I'll play Loki.

3272
02:54:42,730 --> 02:54:44,890
Actually, I don't know what would go well with this.

3273
02:54:45,950 --> 02:54:46,670
I don't know.

3274
02:54:46,850 --> 02:54:47,990
Cloak is that Loki?

3275
02:54:48,870 --> 02:54:49,650
Fuck it.

3276
02:54:50,150 --> 02:54:50,590
Let's go.

3277
02:54:51,590 --> 02:54:52,470
I'm sorry.

3278
02:54:52,670 --> 02:54:54,950
I'm being a detriment to my stack.

3279
02:54:55,310 --> 02:54:56,490
I just wanna play Loki.

3280
02:54:57,530 --> 02:54:58,650
I wanna win too!

3281
02:54:58,830 --> 02:55:00,630
I swear to God, I wanna win.

3282
02:55:00,890 --> 02:55:01,050
I...

3283
02:55:02,070 --> 02:55:03,450
I swear to God.

3284
02:55:03,870 --> 02:55:08,830
I swear to God.

3285
02:55:09,430 --> 02:55:12,030
I swear to God, I do wanna win.

3286
02:55:16,270 --> 02:55:20,030
Yeah, I think... Oh wait, is he not gonna... Oh, is he not gonna go Atom?

3287
02:55:20,170 --> 02:55:21,970
But you're number one Atom!

3288
02:55:24,070 --> 02:55:24,590
Okay.

3289
02:55:25,250 --> 02:55:25,670
Alright.

3290
02:55:26,150 --> 02:55:30,450
Alright, let's let Kuroba rage at me for trying out Atom again.

3291
02:55:31,250 --> 02:55:32,090
Alright, Kuroba.

3292
02:55:32,570 --> 02:55:40,130
I want you to cry when you rewatch this part of the VOD after losing you so many points.

3293
02:55:44,470 --> 02:55:49,230
I hope he watches this part of the VOD and now understands why he's losing.

3294
02:55:59,140 --> 02:56:02,060
I'm not actively throwing!

3295
02:56:02,960 --> 02:56:04,560
I'm just bad!

3296
02:56:06,480 --> 02:56:07,960
There's a difference!

3297
02:56:25,400 --> 02:56:27,220
There's a difference, guys.

3298
02:56:28,700 --> 02:56:29,180
Okay.

3299
02:56:36,120 --> 02:56:37,180
Alright, it's fine.

3300
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:42,760
Come on!

3301
02:56:42,860 --> 02:56:43,160
Come on!

3302
02:56:43,200 --> 02:56:44,120
You guys can kill them!

3303
02:56:44,240 --> 02:56:45,480
I believe.

3304
02:56:47,020 --> 02:56:48,100
That's sad.

3305
02:56:51,300 --> 02:56:53,580
I just need them to understand.

3306
02:56:54,340 --> 02:56:55,720
I'm trying my best.

3307
02:56:56,580 --> 02:56:57,080
I am.

3308
02:56:57,180 --> 02:56:59,840
I swear to God, I'm trying my best.

3309
02:57:00,300 --> 02:57:01,200
I swear.

3310
02:57:01,740 --> 02:57:03,240
I'm not intentionally...

3311
02:57:05,040 --> 02:57:06,200
Oh my God.

3312
02:57:06,280 --> 02:57:08,560
I'm not intentionally fucking up.

3313
02:57:08,720 --> 02:57:11,300
I'm just... I'm just not the best.

3314
02:57:16,040 --> 02:57:19,080
Am I all... I'm popping in here in 3, 2... Big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big!

3315
02:57:19,620 --> 02:57:20,320
Oh my God!

3316
02:57:20,540 --> 02:57:21,840
Oh no, it's fine!

3317
02:57:21,980 --> 02:57:22,500
He got it!

3318
02:57:23,540 --> 02:57:24,620
He got it!

3319
02:57:31,850 --> 02:57:32,990
We're doing it!

3320
02:57:33,630 --> 02:57:35,070
We're doing it!

3321
02:57:36,770 --> 02:57:38,890
Tell me to pass it to your friend.

3322
02:57:38,930 --> 02:57:41,050
I heard you saying you had your ult.

3323
02:57:41,170 --> 02:57:42,430
I'm not smart enough for that shit.

3324
02:57:44,030 --> 02:57:44,950
Oh my God.

3325
02:57:46,410 --> 02:57:47,330
No, no, no, our...

3326
02:57:48,970 --> 02:57:50,970
I mean, he's screaming, he had ult, but...

3327
02:57:51,870 --> 02:57:54,150
Nevermind, I'll just... I'll just fucking do it.

3328
02:57:55,130 --> 02:57:57,650
Not smart enough for this shit.

3329
02:58:01,450 --> 02:58:02,190
You guys are welcome.

3330
02:58:03,970 --> 02:58:05,410
Where did they come from?

3331
02:58:07,270 --> 02:58:08,030
No idea.

3332
02:58:18,970 --> 02:58:20,270
We're so healthy.

3333
02:58:21,550 --> 02:58:23,970
Oh, I'm not healthy no more.

3334
02:58:26,430 --> 02:58:27,270
JK.

3335
02:58:27,270 --> 02:58:29,110
I'm still so healthy.

3336
02:58:30,010 --> 02:58:32,150
Bro, I'm not healthy anymore.

3337
02:58:38,870 --> 02:58:40,690
There we go, we got to 99.

3338
02:58:41,650 --> 02:58:43,230
We did it.

3339
02:58:43,970 --> 02:58:45,610
We did it.

3340
02:58:48,490 --> 02:58:50,090
We're so healthy.

3341
02:58:51,150 --> 02:58:52,630
Look at us go.

3342
02:58:54,150 --> 02:58:55,270
Alright, let's go.

3343
02:58:55,370 --> 02:58:58,990
Now that we're all so healthy, things will be okay.

3344
02:59:00,310 --> 02:59:02,550
Things will be so okay.

3345
02:59:03,450 --> 02:59:06,410
Things will be so okay, I believe.

3346
02:59:08,230 --> 02:59:10,150
Things are... Oh my God.

3347
02:59:10,630 --> 02:59:11,890
Things are so healthy.

3348
02:59:14,910 --> 02:59:16,170
Things are so...

3349
02:59:16,170 --> 02:59:16,270
No.

3350
02:59:18,090 --> 02:59:19,170
That's fine.

3351
02:59:19,830 --> 02:59:20,570
We're so fucking...

3352
02:59:20,810 --> 02:59:22,290
We're so healthy.

3353
02:59:22,870 --> 02:59:24,110
We're so healthy.

3354
02:59:29,030 --> 02:59:30,170
We're so healthy.

3355
02:59:31,730 --> 02:59:32,470
Don't worry.

3356
02:59:35,210 --> 02:59:36,370
We're so good.

3357
02:59:38,030 --> 02:59:39,430
Oh my God.

3358
02:59:40,090 --> 02:59:41,410
Look at us go.

3359
02:59:44,610 --> 02:59:45,530
Come on, review me.

3360
02:59:49,520 --> 02:59:53,980
If you're watching this, I would love to give Audrey...

3361
03:00:00,470 --> 03:00:04,920
If you're watching this part of the phone, do you have any nose caroba?

3362
03:00:05,790 --> 03:00:06,350
Do you have any?

3363
03:00:08,690 --> 03:00:11,030
Mr. Number 1 item player.

3364
03:00:13,490 --> 03:00:15,710
And then we lose this game after.

3365
03:00:20,170 --> 03:00:22,230
I told you guys, we're so healthy.

3366
03:00:28,370 --> 03:00:30,250
Does he have any notes?

3367
03:00:30,370 --> 03:00:31,370
Does he have notes?

3368
03:00:41,330 --> 03:00:43,070
That's messed up.

3369
03:00:46,450 --> 03:00:47,810
I think we're TPing, I think.

3370
03:00:48,790 --> 03:00:49,350
Come on.

3371
03:00:51,110 --> 03:00:51,590
Damn.

3372
03:00:59,070 --> 03:01:00,010
I don't know what to do.

3373
03:01:00,250 --> 03:01:01,970
I didn't expect to get signed.

3374
03:01:02,910 --> 03:01:04,670
But I'll make less money, so I don't know.

3375
03:01:06,530 --> 03:01:08,370
Sorry, I shouldn't say that.

3376
03:01:08,870 --> 03:01:09,770
I'm so funny.

3377
03:01:15,170 --> 03:01:15,650
Okay.

3378
03:01:16,110 --> 03:01:17,950
I mean, he's like in my face right now.

3379
03:01:19,830 --> 03:01:21,010
Oh, he's a respawner.

3380
03:01:23,330 --> 03:01:24,970
Yo, rez us Doki, rez us Doki.

3381
03:01:25,490 --> 03:01:26,190
I'm rezzing.

3382
03:01:26,450 --> 03:01:28,490
Oh, he's on it, he's on me.

3383
03:01:28,570 --> 03:01:30,130
Okay, you got it, let's go, let's go.

3384
03:01:31,350 --> 03:01:31,950
Let's go.

3385
03:01:40,190 --> 03:01:41,810
There's a guy behind us, there's a guy behind us.

3386
03:01:42,790 --> 03:01:43,790
There's a strange on me.

3387
03:01:47,690 --> 03:01:49,630
There we go, plan.

3388
03:01:51,490 --> 03:01:52,310
That's plan.

3389
03:01:52,710 --> 03:01:54,050
I'm doing it.

3390
03:01:59,090 --> 03:02:00,430
I'm doing it.

3391
03:02:01,510 --> 03:02:02,230
Planned!

3392
03:02:02,830 --> 03:02:04,350
So planned.

3393
03:02:06,270 --> 03:02:07,190
So...

3394
03:02:07,190 --> 03:02:08,910
Portal behind me.

3395
03:02:12,550 --> 03:02:13,290
I soulbonded.

3396
03:02:13,390 --> 03:02:13,730
I soulbonded.

3397
03:02:17,010 --> 03:02:18,790
Oh, nevermind.

3398
03:02:19,530 --> 03:02:21,610
Oh, I'm so dead.

3399
03:02:21,770 --> 03:02:22,210
No!

3400
03:02:25,030 --> 03:02:26,950
Oh, that's not ours.

3401
03:02:29,250 --> 03:02:31,370
That's fine, that is ours, JK.

3402
03:02:34,590 --> 03:02:35,550
Planned!

3403
03:02:36,210 --> 03:02:38,930
100% planned!

3404
03:02:39,790 --> 03:02:41,630
Let's go!

3405
03:02:41,630 --> 03:02:41,990
Let's go!

3406
03:02:43,910 --> 03:02:45,350
Ain't no go.

3407
03:02:46,790 --> 03:02:47,750
Ain't no go.

3408
03:02:48,270 --> 03:02:50,790
I'm not doing so great, don't go.

3409
03:02:51,050 --> 03:02:53,670
I'm getting stream sniped oblivious.

3410
03:02:55,010 --> 03:02:58,710
I just changed my stream title to be like, just quick play gaming.

3411
03:02:59,030 --> 03:03:00,370
Not playing rank at all.

3412
03:03:07,290 --> 03:03:09,050
Not playing rank.

3413
03:03:09,770 --> 03:03:10,850
I soulbonded us.

3414
03:03:11,630 --> 03:03:14,330
What do I do?

3415
03:03:14,790 --> 03:03:16,930
Oh my god, there's so many!

3416
03:03:24,150 --> 03:03:27,290
Come on, Maze, we're chilling.

3417
03:03:30,300 --> 03:03:32,190
Yeah, yeah.

3418
03:03:32,430 --> 03:03:34,330
I hope we lose this game.

3419
03:03:46,110 --> 03:03:47,870
Woah, goodbye.

3420
03:03:51,420 --> 03:03:54,830
It would be great if we had a strange ult right now.

3421
03:03:55,290 --> 03:03:56,370
That would be so silly.

3422
03:03:59,310 --> 03:04:02,590
That would be so silly, right?

3423
03:04:03,030 --> 03:04:03,410
Guys?

3424
03:04:11,630 --> 03:04:13,790
I'm gonna watch him kill you.

3425
03:04:23,450 --> 03:04:26,230
I can't believe he lived!

3426
03:04:26,870 --> 03:04:28,630
I can't believe he lived!

3427
03:04:32,430 --> 03:04:33,570
Oh shit!

3428
03:04:36,210 --> 03:04:36,690
Nice!

3429
03:04:38,310 --> 03:04:40,110
Wait, there's Starlord still here.

3430
03:04:41,630 --> 03:04:43,210
Everybody take TP, everybody take TP.

3431
03:04:43,250 --> 03:04:44,650
TP, TP, TP, TP, TP, TP!

3432
03:04:44,650 --> 03:04:46,330
TP, TP, TP, TP, TP, TP!

3433
03:04:46,330 --> 03:04:47,750
TP, TP, TP, TP, TP, TP!

3434
03:04:48,030 --> 03:04:48,790
What is that?

3435
03:04:53,010 --> 03:04:54,810
I'm having too much fun here.

3436
03:04:54,910 --> 03:04:55,690
This is a problem.

3437
03:04:57,550 --> 03:04:58,550
There we go.

3438
03:04:59,530 --> 03:05:01,870
Look at that, 100% win rate on Adam.

3439
03:05:02,090 --> 03:05:02,870
There you go.

3440
03:05:04,350 --> 03:05:07,490
The perfect Adam win streak continues!

3441
03:05:08,330 --> 03:05:09,370
Let's go!

3442
03:05:10,250 --> 03:05:12,130
I don't know how I keep winning on Adam.

3443
03:05:12,470 --> 03:05:13,510
I don't know how.

3444
03:05:14,150 --> 03:05:15,870
Even when I'm not fucking stacking.

3445
03:05:16,550 --> 03:05:17,990
Guys, we're almost...

3446
03:05:17,990 --> 03:05:21,370
After 3 hours, we're just down...

3447
03:05:22,250 --> 03:05:24,650
We're just down 10 points.

3448
03:05:27,030 --> 03:05:28,330
We did it!

3449
03:05:30,450 --> 03:05:33,410
We're totally down 10 points after 3 hours.

3450
03:05:33,530 --> 03:05:34,690
I'm just that good.

3451
03:05:40,900 --> 03:05:42,600
Sound about right.

3452
03:05:44,300 --> 03:05:46,380
Noco, what's your ink now, Noco?

3453
03:05:48,080 --> 03:05:50,520
That's when you know it's a good session, guys.

3454
03:05:50,600 --> 03:05:52,380
When you're almost back to where you started.

3455
03:05:52,920 --> 03:05:54,280
That's when you know.

3456
03:05:55,100 --> 03:05:55,620
270?

3457
03:05:55,760 --> 03:05:57,320
Oh shit, you're climbing!

3458
03:05:59,860 --> 03:06:01,560
I've been stuck in purgatory.

3459
03:06:04,140 --> 03:06:07,540
I legitimately think I have a target on my back right now.

3460
03:06:08,220 --> 03:06:09,600
I'm like, I don't...

3461
03:06:10,320 --> 03:06:12,300
Ever since I came back to Twitch.

3462
03:06:17,300 --> 03:06:18,400
What's the cutoff?

3463
03:06:18,600 --> 03:06:21,060
I think cutoff would be 250 or 260.

3464
03:06:21,520 --> 03:06:23,420
It's like climbing 20 points a day.

3465
03:06:24,120 --> 03:06:24,820
Am I winning?

3466
03:06:25,220 --> 03:06:27,800
Well, after 3 hours, I'm down 10 points.

3467
03:06:27,960 --> 03:06:28,660
Is that winning?

3468
03:06:32,670 --> 03:06:35,630
Yeah, the Marvel devs made a hit list for me.

3469
03:06:36,370 --> 03:06:37,730
They're like, we're gonna get her.

3470
03:06:37,730 --> 03:06:39,070
We're gonna fucking...

3471
03:06:39,070 --> 03:06:40,070
She's gonna...

3472
03:06:40,070 --> 03:06:41,730
She's gonna be here forever.

3473
03:06:42,750 --> 03:06:44,830
She's gonna chase the top 500 high.

3474
03:06:44,970 --> 03:06:47,090
And then just barely miss it every time.

3475
03:06:47,270 --> 03:06:49,570
And then every season, she'll think it's different.

3476
03:06:49,750 --> 03:06:51,730
And then we're just gonna hire like...

3477
03:06:51,730 --> 03:06:55,770
We're just gonna hire the entire Marvel rival player base to fuck her up.

3478
03:06:56,770 --> 03:07:00,570
I feel like I'm going into like conspiracy theorist territory right now.

3479
03:07:00,650 --> 03:07:02,290
I think they're all out to get me.

3480
03:07:03,090 --> 03:07:03,610
Honestly!

3481
03:07:05,710 --> 03:07:06,750
Stream snipers!

3482
03:07:06,750 --> 03:07:08,710
Do you know who's also streaming?

3483
03:07:09,450 --> 03:07:10,310
Shrouded Ninja!

3484
03:07:11,410 --> 03:07:12,810
Oh my god.

3485
03:07:13,770 --> 03:07:14,930
Oh, you know what would be funny?

3486
03:07:15,030 --> 03:07:16,910
If they get mad at your stream sniping.

3487
03:07:17,370 --> 03:07:18,770
Oh, it would be so funny.

3488
03:07:19,330 --> 03:07:21,010
It would be so...

3489
03:07:21,010 --> 03:07:23,330
What the fuck are you talking about?

3490
03:07:24,050 --> 03:07:27,590
I've been playing Marvel rivals for too long.

3491
03:07:28,710 --> 03:07:29,530
Oh, he's doing cat.

3492
03:07:29,590 --> 03:07:30,330
They don't know that.

3493
03:07:31,070 --> 03:07:33,330
They'll be like, oh my god, he is.

3494
03:07:33,370 --> 03:07:34,990
And then they're gonna click out of the stream.

3495
03:07:36,750 --> 03:07:36,790
Hahaha.

3496
03:07:42,150 --> 03:07:44,770
Who are you talking to, bro?

3497
03:07:45,990 --> 03:07:48,570
Guys, making Ninja crash out would be so funny.

3498
03:07:48,810 --> 03:07:50,010
All I do is laugh.

3499
03:07:50,670 --> 03:07:51,990
All I do is laugh.

3500
03:07:53,290 --> 03:07:53,750
Hahaha.

3501
03:07:58,350 --> 03:08:01,010
But it's funny to stream snipe the VTuber?

3502
03:08:01,990 --> 03:08:03,390
It's literally not real.

3503
03:08:03,710 --> 03:08:04,790
How would it be funny?

3504
03:08:05,790 --> 03:08:07,850
You laugh and cry.

3505
03:08:08,030 --> 03:08:10,030
I'm not real, I'm virtual.

3506
03:08:21,160 --> 03:08:23,800
Oh my god, it's Mr. Fister!

3507
03:08:25,440 --> 03:08:27,020
Oh, women are real too.

3508
03:08:32,020 --> 03:08:34,220
Didn't you guys know that?

3509
03:08:34,400 --> 03:08:35,500
They're not real.

3510
03:08:35,500 --> 03:08:37,540
Have you ever seen a woman?

3511
03:08:43,420 --> 03:08:45,500
It's just a conspiracy theorist.

3512
03:08:46,860 --> 03:08:47,920
Invented by the government.

3513
03:08:50,340 --> 03:08:53,060
See, I'm not trolling.

3514
03:08:53,160 --> 03:08:54,000
My team's trolling.

3515
03:08:54,180 --> 03:08:55,720
I let them ban players now.

3516
03:08:57,260 --> 03:08:59,560
Yeah, women are like a government psyops.

3517
03:09:00,280 --> 03:09:01,360
Just like birds.

3518
03:09:03,460 --> 03:09:04,540
Bitches aren't real either.

3519
03:09:06,220 --> 03:09:08,160
Have you ever seen a pigeon sleep?

3520
03:09:11,080 --> 03:09:11,760
No,

3521
03:09:14,860 --> 03:09:15,800
he can't.

3522
03:09:16,340 --> 03:09:17,560
Who is he gonna fist?

3523
03:09:18,140 --> 03:09:19,500
He can't fist.

3524
03:09:20,560 --> 03:09:21,880
Who is he gonna fist?

3525
03:09:22,360 --> 03:09:23,240
It's the fucking aura, bro.

3526
03:09:23,280 --> 03:09:24,580
It's the aura.

3527
03:09:28,280 --> 03:09:29,760
Who's Black Widow?

3528
03:09:30,820 --> 03:09:31,140
Alright.

3529
03:09:31,140 --> 03:09:41,300
Oh my god, please lord, make the game ha- No fist, why live?

3530
03:09:41,600 --> 03:09:42,100
Exactly.

3531
03:09:42,820 --> 03:09:46,140
If you can't fist anybody, then you might as well just...

3532
03:09:47,260 --> 03:09:48,360
Do a flip.

3533
03:09:48,800 --> 03:09:49,580
Off a cliff.

3534
03:09:50,540 --> 03:09:51,140
In game.

3535
03:09:58,360 --> 03:09:59,620
What is he gonna do?

3536
03:09:59,640 --> 03:10:00,380
It's his life!

3537
03:10:01,600 --> 03:10:03,280
It's literally his life!

3538
03:10:04,200 --> 03:10:07,280
He's gonna be called Mr. Fister just to not fist?

3539
03:10:07,380 --> 03:10:08,240
Like, what's the point?

3540
03:10:09,000 --> 03:10:10,600
He's literally lying on the internet.

3541
03:10:10,840 --> 03:10:12,040
Who does that?

3542
03:10:16,500 --> 03:10:19,760
Guys, I can't believe they target banned me.

3543
03:10:20,360 --> 03:10:22,760
The 100% win rate Adam.

3544
03:10:23,100 --> 03:10:24,820
That's so fucked up.

3545
03:10:25,460 --> 03:10:26,480
Specifically me.

3546
03:10:26,480 --> 03:10:27,160
Me.

3547
03:10:32,060 --> 03:10:33,620
Alright guys, this is my wake up call.

3548
03:10:34,200 --> 03:10:35,080
Can we log in?

3549
03:10:35,760 --> 03:10:39,220
I can't believe they target banned my Adam.

3550
03:10:40,460 --> 03:10:41,120
Alright, Mr. Fister.

3551
03:10:41,420 --> 03:10:42,680
You know how to play, right?

3552
03:10:43,760 --> 03:10:44,340
Uh, kind of.

3553
03:10:46,580 --> 03:10:47,540
Kind of?!

3554
03:10:49,360 --> 03:10:50,280
No, I was joking.

3555
03:10:50,800 --> 03:10:51,280
Yes!

3556
03:10:51,880 --> 03:10:52,200
Oh!

3557
03:10:53,780 --> 03:10:54,260
Wow!

3558
03:10:54,980 --> 03:10:56,000
And you get topped off, you.

3559
03:10:56,820 --> 03:10:57,650
Third day TP'd.

3560
03:10:59,100 --> 03:11:00,880
That box looked so dead.

3561
03:11:01,020 --> 03:11:02,460
Fucking third inning, not gonna lie.

3562
03:11:06,410 --> 03:11:07,090
Oh man.

3563
03:11:08,970 --> 03:11:11,010
I'm a little scared being here.

3564
03:11:11,190 --> 03:11:12,090
Like, not gonna lie.

3565
03:11:12,570 --> 03:11:13,330
Wait, there's a Hawkeye.

3566
03:11:13,450 --> 03:11:14,470
He's frozen behind me.

3567
03:11:16,310 --> 03:11:17,910
I don't wanna look at him.

3568
03:11:18,350 --> 03:11:18,650
Wait, where?

3569
03:11:18,870 --> 03:11:19,730
He's right here, he's right here!

3570
03:11:24,370 --> 03:11:24,830
Oh!

3571
03:11:25,350 --> 03:11:25,810
No!

3572
03:11:27,930 --> 03:11:30,050
I couldn't do anything!

3573
03:11:33,570 --> 03:11:34,610
Oh, it's third!

3574
03:11:34,790 --> 03:11:35,070
No!

3575
03:11:35,210 --> 03:11:36,090
Mr. Fister!

3576
03:11:37,370 --> 03:11:38,670
Mr. Fister!

3577
03:11:42,770 --> 03:11:46,570
Guys, don't say that.

3578
03:11:46,610 --> 03:11:48,730
I don't think they're willing to play with me for 16 hours.

3579
03:11:51,070 --> 03:11:52,370
I think he'll leave.

3580
03:11:52,750 --> 03:11:54,550
This group will leave by then.

3581
03:12:00,790 --> 03:12:05,350
Guys, I'm just gonna ELO terrorize them for like, until they're done with me.

3582
03:12:05,410 --> 03:12:05,550
No!

3583
03:12:14,400 --> 03:12:15,080
Alright.

3584
03:12:16,300 --> 03:12:18,080
Alright, I'm dancing!

3585
03:12:19,140 --> 03:12:20,500
I'm dancing!

3586
03:12:21,740 --> 03:12:22,080
Here.

3587
03:12:22,400 --> 03:12:22,660
Here.

3588
03:12:22,940 --> 03:12:23,280
Here.

3589
03:12:23,740 --> 03:12:24,020
Here.

3590
03:12:24,320 --> 03:12:24,760
Here.

3591
03:12:26,040 --> 03:12:27,060
I'm dead.

3592
03:12:32,210 --> 03:12:34,430
Oh my god, he never missed!

3593
03:12:36,010 --> 03:12:38,250
What does Mr. Fister play?

3594
03:12:43,890 --> 03:12:44,890
What's my rank now?

3595
03:12:44,970 --> 03:12:46,410
I'm down 10 points.

3596
03:12:46,730 --> 03:12:50,510
If that sort of tells you what's going on right now.

3597
03:12:50,810 --> 03:12:56,550
If that gives you an indication of what my life is like at the moment.

3598
03:12:59,250 --> 03:13:02,710
Guys, I have a feeling that Mr. Fister might not be a Wolverine.

3599
03:13:03,410 --> 03:13:04,190
Yeah, I...

3600
03:13:04,190 --> 03:13:04,710
Come on.

3601
03:13:07,150 --> 03:13:10,470
Maybe he'd get our ass off, Wolverine.

3602
03:13:10,630 --> 03:13:13,250
As he gets nobody with it.

3603
03:13:14,030 --> 03:13:17,070
Oh my god, he got his first fucking grab!

3604
03:13:18,590 --> 03:13:20,570
I love how he's like...

3605
03:13:20,570 --> 03:13:25,290
We literally saw him get nobody and then we're like, maybe it's time to retire.

3606
03:13:25,950 --> 03:13:27,990
The Wolverine.

3607
03:13:29,430 --> 03:13:31,470
What is he without the fisting?

3608
03:13:32,250 --> 03:13:33,470
Okay, Mr. Fister.

3609
03:13:34,190 --> 03:13:35,450
Okay, no longer does.

3610
03:13:44,870 --> 03:13:47,610
There's a stranger just running at me from behind.

3611
03:13:52,960 --> 03:13:55,620
The gorilla man, there's no way I just heard you say, I got wild.

3612
03:13:55,860 --> 03:13:58,200
Like, they have no dude, brother, it's your own world!

3613
03:14:05,560 --> 03:14:08,380
I got walled by my own teammate!

3614
03:14:09,720 --> 03:14:11,960
I don't even have a crit!

3615
03:14:12,420 --> 03:14:12,560
What are you saying?

3616
03:14:15,220 --> 03:14:17,400
Please don't die trying to heal.

3617
03:14:22,640 --> 03:14:24,340
It's winnable, it's winnable.

3618
03:14:25,340 --> 03:14:27,300
Oh, I'm going in.

3619
03:14:28,000 --> 03:14:29,400
Oh my god.

3620
03:14:30,300 --> 03:14:33,000
Oh my god.

3621
03:14:37,000 --> 03:14:39,120
Yeah, they have a stranger Hawkeye.

3622
03:14:40,420 --> 03:14:42,720
There it is.

3623
03:14:46,100 --> 03:14:49,880
Oh my god.

3624
03:14:59,480 --> 03:15:00,720
I'm trying.

3625
03:15:02,640 --> 03:15:04,320
There's someone behind us too!

3626
03:15:07,180 --> 03:15:08,640
Wait, you're focusing on me?

3627
03:15:08,720 --> 03:15:09,320
You're full HP.

3628
03:15:12,040 --> 03:15:13,600
There's a Mantis right behind us.

3629
03:15:14,560 --> 03:15:15,580
We stay here, we stay here.

3630
03:15:15,880 --> 03:15:16,920
I have a plan, I have a plan.

3631
03:15:17,120 --> 03:15:18,580
And it's D.Va's, it's D.Va's, it's D.Va's.

3632
03:15:18,600 --> 03:15:19,900
I have a plan, I have a plan, I have a plan, I have a plan, I have a plan, I have a plan, I have a plan, I have a plan.

3633
03:15:20,640 --> 03:15:22,100
Here's my plan, here's my plan.

3634
03:15:22,260 --> 03:15:23,040
Oh my god!

3635
03:15:26,900 --> 03:15:28,520
I got a kill, I got a kill, it was all me.

3636
03:15:28,520 --> 03:15:29,980
Let's go, let's go!

3637
03:15:29,980 --> 03:15:30,120
Oh!

3638
03:15:34,700 --> 03:15:35,140
Okay.

3639
03:15:38,660 --> 03:15:40,420
Okay, that...

3640
03:15:40,420 --> 03:15:42,760
Okay, I...

3641
03:15:43,980 --> 03:15:46,960
I got walled with you, me.

3642
03:15:47,020 --> 03:15:50,100
They told us that Groot is our own Groot.

3643
03:15:52,180 --> 03:15:53,060
But...

3644
03:16:02,740 --> 03:16:03,640
Oh!

3645
03:16:04,700 --> 03:16:05,920
Oh, Mr. Fister, you're living.

3646
03:16:09,220 --> 03:16:14,100
Okay, three, two, one.

3647
03:16:14,100 --> 03:16:14,420
Please.

3648
03:16:18,340 --> 03:16:20,360
I'm heal boosting for you.

3649
03:16:23,160 --> 03:16:24,440
Oh no!

3650
03:16:31,640 --> 03:16:33,540
We saw another fight.

3651
03:16:37,600 --> 03:16:41,700
Mr. Fister, I think you need to make sure you're not Wolverine.

3652
03:16:44,100 --> 03:16:47,100
I'm glad you swapped out Wolverine.

3653
03:16:49,160 --> 03:16:55,640
I got you.

3654
03:17:01,680 --> 03:17:05,000
Oh my god!

3655
03:17:05,000 --> 03:17:05,560
Oh!

3656
03:17:11,560 --> 03:17:12,060
Nice!

3657
03:17:13,820 --> 03:17:16,160
Oh my god, they're doing it!

3658
03:17:17,020 --> 03:17:19,020
They're doing it!

3659
03:17:20,080 --> 03:17:22,040
They're doing it!

3660
03:17:22,640 --> 03:17:24,140
It's legendary!

3661
03:17:29,840 --> 03:17:32,020
Oh my god, he's doing it!

3662
03:17:32,020 --> 03:17:34,160
He is great!

3663
03:17:34,680 --> 03:17:36,520
Like, Wolverine was...

3664
03:17:36,520 --> 03:17:38,060
I don't...

3665
03:17:38,060 --> 03:17:41,580
I don't think...

3666
03:17:41,580 --> 03:17:43,520
Guys, who would have thought...

3667
03:17:43,520 --> 03:17:46,760
Having claws while fisting is not great.

3668
03:17:47,500 --> 03:17:49,640
It's not like... it's not...

3669
03:17:51,940 --> 03:17:55,660
Who would have thought that...

3670
03:17:55,660 --> 03:17:58,920
You shouldn't have claws while you're fisting.

3671
03:17:59,800 --> 03:18:02,160
I mean, it could help too.

3672
03:18:04,880 --> 03:18:05,980
I can!

3673
03:18:09,260 --> 03:18:10,140
Exactly.

3674
03:18:10,760 --> 03:18:12,540
She gets it.

3675
03:18:15,320 --> 03:18:17,580
Okay, okay.

3676
03:18:18,040 --> 03:18:18,840
Wait, what?

3677
03:18:19,000 --> 03:18:19,660
I did not say that.

3678
03:18:22,560 --> 03:18:23,440
Is this fine?

3679
03:18:29,580 --> 03:18:32,060
That's a punch-up muncher right there.

3680
03:18:32,100 --> 03:18:32,740
Punch-up muncher?

3681
03:18:32,800 --> 03:18:33,440
Oh, my fault.

3682
03:18:35,860 --> 03:18:36,280
See?

3683
03:18:36,280 --> 03:18:37,500
I guess we all agree.

3684
03:18:39,320 --> 03:18:40,600
Wait, wait, wait.

3685
03:18:41,800 --> 03:18:42,180
Wait.

3686
03:18:46,080 --> 03:18:48,340
I'm so scared, I'm so scared, I'm so scared.

3687
03:18:50,460 --> 03:18:52,100
Chill, chill, chill, chill.

3688
03:18:52,440 --> 03:18:52,960
Wait, chill.

3689
03:18:54,660 --> 03:18:55,860
Chill, chill, chill.

3690
03:18:59,140 --> 03:19:00,860
Just chill, chill.

3691
03:19:01,540 --> 03:19:02,200
Wait, what the fuck?

3692
03:19:02,280 --> 03:19:03,180
I got pushed instantly.

3693
03:19:03,820 --> 03:19:04,540
That's what I'm saying.

3694
03:19:04,800 --> 03:19:06,300
I was so good.

3695
03:19:06,340 --> 03:19:07,080
Why is he back?

3696
03:19:07,520 --> 03:19:09,540
You can't leave the fisting life, guys.

3697
03:19:09,600 --> 03:19:10,460
You don't understand.

3698
03:19:11,120 --> 03:19:11,600
Wait, where are you?

3699
03:19:12,260 --> 03:19:13,660
You don't understand.

3700
03:19:14,880 --> 03:19:16,580
You don't understand.

3701
03:19:24,480 --> 03:19:25,920
Oh, my God.

3702
03:19:29,900 --> 03:19:31,140
I soloed him, I soloed him.

3703
03:19:31,600 --> 03:19:32,840
Oh, my God, he did it.

3704
03:19:34,080 --> 03:19:37,800
Oh, my God.

3705
03:19:38,200 --> 03:19:42,180
Oh, my God, this is scary because there's a Hawkeye just fucking looking at me right now.

3706
03:19:43,360 --> 03:19:44,240
This is so scary.

3707
03:19:45,580 --> 03:19:46,800
This is so scary.

3708
03:19:47,800 --> 03:19:49,060
This is actually so scary.

3709
03:19:55,480 --> 03:19:56,840
Oh, my God.

3710
03:19:57,160 --> 03:19:58,600
No, Mr. Fister!

3711
03:19:58,600 --> 03:20:00,920
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

3712
03:20:03,460 --> 03:20:04,300
That's awkward.

3713
03:20:09,400 --> 03:20:10,200
That's awkward.

3714
03:20:10,700 --> 03:20:11,680
Get off it, get off it, get off it.

3715
03:20:13,160 --> 03:20:15,840
Okay, that's good enough.

3716
03:20:20,140 --> 03:20:23,400
Get off it, get off it right now.

3717
03:20:24,600 --> 03:20:25,820
I'm gonna go left side.

3718
03:20:26,720 --> 03:20:30,260
If you can play like a boss or something here, it'll make me so happy.

3719
03:20:36,140 --> 03:20:38,080
How did it die?

3720
03:20:39,100 --> 03:20:40,880
Here, here, here.

3721
03:20:43,680 --> 03:20:46,340
Here, here, here.

3722
03:20:49,860 --> 03:20:50,540
Nice.

3723
03:20:53,840 --> 03:20:55,160
Oh, it's gone, it's gone.

3724
03:20:57,400 --> 03:20:59,920
I have... oh, no, I couldn't do anything.

3725
03:21:01,800 --> 03:21:02,980
Wait, did he swap up?

3726
03:21:03,060 --> 03:21:03,960
Oh, now he's on path.

3727
03:21:04,120 --> 03:21:05,120
I don't understand.

3728
03:21:06,060 --> 03:21:08,940
He was so good at Hawkeye.

3729
03:21:10,540 --> 03:21:14,220
He's not playing every Fister character possible.

3730
03:21:17,780 --> 03:21:19,420
Oh, my God.

3731
03:21:19,420 --> 03:21:20,400
Okay, we're stopping.

3732
03:21:24,360 --> 03:21:26,300
I got you, bro.

3733
03:21:26,740 --> 03:21:27,940
I got you.

3734
03:21:29,960 --> 03:21:31,540
Bro, I don't got you.

3735
03:21:34,160 --> 03:21:35,980
I got you, bro.

3736
03:21:43,160 --> 03:21:44,000
Don't worry, bro.

3737
03:21:44,160 --> 03:21:45,000
He's got you.

3738
03:21:51,790 --> 03:21:53,450
Oh, my God.

3739
03:21:54,750 --> 03:21:56,210
Oh, my God.

3740
03:21:56,250 --> 03:21:57,070
He's got you, bro.

3741
03:22:04,990 --> 03:22:06,070
Here,

3742
03:22:11,130 --> 03:22:17,590
here, here, here, here, here.

3743
03:22:20,790 --> 03:22:22,770
Oh, my God.

3744
03:22:23,070 --> 03:22:24,070
I'm asleep.

3745
03:22:26,510 --> 03:22:27,390
No.

3746
03:22:31,510 --> 03:22:33,450
If you guys survive, I have ult.

3747
03:22:41,430 --> 03:22:42,310
Oh,

3748
03:22:46,510 --> 03:22:47,610
my God.

3749
03:22:50,450 --> 03:22:52,910
Oh, my God.

3750
03:22:55,390 --> 03:22:57,930
Three, two, one.

3751
03:22:58,070 --> 03:22:58,590
It's gone.

3752
03:23:03,470 --> 03:23:05,230
I have Hawkeye on me.

3753
03:23:05,710 --> 03:23:07,470
I have Hawkeye on me.

3754
03:23:08,750 --> 03:23:10,410
Oh, my God.

3755
03:23:11,150 --> 03:23:15,790
Guys, I think banning Fister was the...

3756
03:23:16,610 --> 03:23:21,270
I think Mr. Fister got a little...

3757
03:23:23,850 --> 03:23:26,130
Yo, Fister.

3758
03:23:39,210 --> 03:23:39,850
Guys,

3759
03:23:43,730 --> 03:23:45,450
who paid off Mr. Fister?

3760
03:23:45,710 --> 03:23:46,390
Who was it?

3761
03:23:46,470 --> 03:23:48,150
Who was it in chat?

3762
03:23:48,350 --> 03:23:49,550
Who paid him off?

3763
03:23:50,570 --> 03:23:52,850
Who paid off Mr. Fister?

3764
03:23:53,790 --> 03:23:55,350
Who was it?

3765
03:23:55,650 --> 03:23:57,190
Not me.

3766
03:23:58,490 --> 03:24:01,430
Sorry, I got his name wrong.

3767
03:24:01,750 --> 03:24:03,770
Who the fuck was it?

3768
03:24:06,650 --> 03:24:08,390
He was an inside.

3769
03:24:08,590 --> 03:24:12,910
I refuse to believe he was not an inside job.

3770
03:24:13,190 --> 03:24:15,570
I refuse to believe that.

3771
03:24:17,690 --> 03:24:18,930
It was Marvel.

3772
03:24:19,190 --> 03:24:21,510
It wasn't Spider-Man, that fucking menace.

3773
03:24:21,710 --> 03:24:24,410
I actually have no idea of the lore behind Iron Fist.

3774
03:24:25,630 --> 03:24:29,870
I have no idea who he is, other than the fact that he likes to punch.

3775
03:24:32,370 --> 03:24:41,030
What I like about Marvel Rivals is that they are introducing a lot of characters that are normally not popular in the Marvel Universe.

3776
03:24:44,110 --> 03:24:45,770
That's what I like about it.

3777
03:24:47,270 --> 03:24:48,190
He's rich.

3778
03:24:48,330 --> 03:24:49,470
I mean, that's like...

3779
03:24:51,190 --> 03:24:54,390
That's like majority of these fucking... except for Peter Parker.

3780
03:24:54,770 --> 03:24:55,810
Thank God he's broke.

3781
03:24:56,590 --> 03:24:57,730
Fucking menace to society.

3782
03:25:00,390 --> 03:25:02,910
Whoever did it, I'm laughing.

3783
03:25:06,210 --> 03:25:06,810
Wow!

3784
03:25:09,470 --> 03:25:10,510
That's right.

3785
03:25:10,510 --> 03:25:12,210
He deserves it.

3786
03:25:12,350 --> 03:25:13,670
That's why he's broke.

3787
03:25:17,550 --> 03:25:21,130
Camera boy is broke as fuck.

3788
03:25:22,550 --> 03:25:23,530
That's right.

3789
03:25:24,430 --> 03:25:26,850
I was gonna say something really fucked up, but like...

3790
03:25:27,790 --> 03:25:28,510
Alright,

3791
03:25:33,570 --> 03:25:34,370
this is a joke.

3792
03:25:34,490 --> 03:25:38,230
I don't actually mean it, but like...

3793
03:25:38,230 --> 03:25:40,530
But like...

3794
03:25:41,330 --> 03:25:43,670
That's what he gets for being a photographer.

3795
03:25:45,750 --> 03:25:48,570
For trying to make a hobby a career.

3796
03:25:49,130 --> 03:25:50,930
Should've got a real job.

3797
03:25:56,290 --> 03:25:57,270
That's right.

3798
03:25:57,350 --> 03:26:00,270
You should've got a real fucking job, Peter Parker.

3799
03:26:04,110 --> 03:26:05,110
Travis Clippet.

3800
03:26:05,450 --> 03:26:10,490
He's a sa- It depends on which Peter Parker lore you're trying to look at.

3801
03:26:11,610 --> 03:26:17,430
Cause like, in one instance, he's just a photographer for a newspaper, which is a dying media.

3802
03:26:17,610 --> 03:26:19,010
Peter Parker, you're a fucking idiot.

3803
03:26:20,030 --> 03:26:24,210
That's what you get for trying to be a photographer in a dying media.

3804
03:26:25,150 --> 03:26:26,830
Just fucking be a blogger.

3805
03:26:31,860 --> 03:26:34,340
These have been some of the most cursed games.

3806
03:26:36,780 --> 03:26:37,980
You know what's funny?

3807
03:26:39,380 --> 03:26:41,660
Mace was like, don't worry, it's gonna be so easy.

3808
03:26:41,860 --> 03:26:43,040
Six wins, let's go.

3809
03:26:43,880 --> 03:26:44,660
I'm sorry.

3810
03:26:45,640 --> 03:26:46,960
I warned him.

3811
03:26:47,240 --> 03:26:49,340
It was never gonna be easy.

3812
03:26:54,420 --> 03:26:55,960
I warned him.

3813
03:26:57,380 --> 03:26:59,820
I told him it won't be easy.

3814
03:27:02,060 --> 03:27:05,500
It was rigged from the start.

3815
03:27:10,410 --> 03:27:12,770
Mace walked into the hole.

3816
03:27:14,690 --> 03:27:15,310
He did.

3817
03:27:16,350 --> 03:27:18,390
I wish people moved just like these bots.

3818
03:27:19,110 --> 03:27:20,670
Then I'd definitely be top 500.

3819
03:27:24,510 --> 03:27:25,510
Doom Q.

3820
03:27:26,010 --> 03:27:28,550
I'm not dooming anymore, I've accepted my fate.

3821
03:27:29,310 --> 03:27:31,570
I've accepted my place in the world.

3822
03:27:32,390 --> 03:27:34,010
Always chasing the dream.

3823
03:27:34,710 --> 03:27:36,170
Never achieving it.

3824
03:27:37,070 --> 03:27:39,050
Just the way it is.

3825
03:27:41,950 --> 03:27:45,650
If I get it, it'll just be a very pleasant surprise.

3826
03:27:48,290 --> 03:27:49,990
Evolved Control Q.

3827
03:27:52,030 --> 03:27:57,150
I wanna say this is a really fucked up joke, but I'm really worried that they'll take offense to it.

3828
03:28:01,570 --> 03:28:03,290
For legal reasons.

3829
03:28:03,730 --> 03:28:08,730
To my stack who may or may not be watching this stream right now.

3830
03:28:09,410 --> 03:28:11,290
It's a joke.

3831
03:28:11,610 --> 03:28:12,710
I swear to god.

3832
03:28:12,770 --> 03:28:14,870
I just thought it's a funny joke.

3833
03:28:15,470 --> 03:28:18,470
Please, it's not personal.

3834
03:28:20,590 --> 03:28:21,390
But...

3835
03:28:27,730 --> 03:28:28,530
But...

3836
03:28:29,390 --> 03:28:31,090
Sorry, I was hesitating.

3837
03:28:35,870 --> 03:28:36,390
But...

3838
03:28:40,190 --> 03:28:42,250
Disclaimer, this is just a joke.

3839
03:28:44,430 --> 03:28:44,950
But...

3840
03:28:44,950 --> 03:28:47,610
They're used to losing, so what's one more loss?

3841
03:28:51,350 --> 03:28:52,310
It's a joke!

3842
03:28:52,390 --> 03:28:52,870
It's a joke!

3843
03:28:52,990 --> 03:28:55,570
They won the last two tournaments!

3844
03:28:58,970 --> 03:29:00,070
It's a joke!

3845
03:29:00,070 --> 03:29:02,890
I thought it's a joke!

3846
03:29:05,470 --> 03:29:08,850
Stack, leave now.

3847
03:29:09,590 --> 03:29:11,270
Leave her now.

3848
03:29:12,170 --> 03:29:13,510
Clip it, clip it.

3849
03:29:13,650 --> 03:29:16,850
It's just kicked from, removed from the stack.

3850
03:29:17,290 --> 03:29:19,050
Yeah, the stack is done.

3851
03:29:21,390 --> 03:29:22,150
Please!

3852
03:29:22,810 --> 03:29:24,310
It's just a joke!

3853
03:29:24,430 --> 03:29:27,110
I put 400 disclaimers!

3854
03:29:30,070 --> 03:29:33,990
Wow, you're gonna end up being solo ulted by an entire team.

3855
03:29:34,230 --> 03:29:36,350
You didn't have to do it to them.

3856
03:29:36,530 --> 03:29:37,910
They're really good players!

3857
03:29:38,310 --> 03:29:40,310
They won the other two tournaments!

3858
03:29:41,290 --> 03:29:43,170
Well, like two of them did.

3859
03:29:44,190 --> 03:29:45,710
Sorry, I need to stop.

3860
03:29:45,970 --> 03:29:50,510
I need to stop.

3861
03:29:50,590 --> 03:29:51,090
I'm sorry.

3862
03:29:51,670 --> 03:29:53,430
The twitch in me is coming up.

3863
03:29:53,430 --> 03:29:53,950
What?

3864
03:29:55,990 --> 03:29:56,550
What?

3865
03:29:57,610 --> 03:30:00,110
Doki, why did you keep digging the hole?

3866
03:30:02,950 --> 03:30:05,490
Stop doubling down, Doki!

3867
03:30:10,210 --> 03:30:12,310
Doki doesn't stop digging.

3868
03:30:15,110 --> 03:30:17,110
No, you don't even have to send it to the enemy team.

3869
03:30:17,170 --> 03:30:18,650
You send it to my own team.

3870
03:30:18,910 --> 03:30:21,170
I'm literally sabotaging my own stack.

3871
03:30:22,990 --> 03:30:24,330
Stop kidding.

3872
03:30:33,860 --> 03:30:36,400
It's okay, I'm reformed now.

3873
03:30:36,520 --> 03:30:38,840
Now I'll lock in, guys.

3874
03:30:41,380 --> 03:30:42,820
I'm gonna lock in right now.

3875
03:30:42,820 --> 03:30:46,340
Now, who am I gonna banish from this match?

3876
03:30:49,380 --> 03:30:51,340
This time, I realized.

3877
03:30:51,720 --> 03:30:53,920
Guys, I literally don't know what happened to my OBS.

3878
03:30:54,240 --> 03:30:56,020
I don't know how to end my stream.

3879
03:30:56,180 --> 03:31:00,020
I think I actually have to force quit my stream.

3880
03:31:00,500 --> 03:31:09,260
Just to actually be able to end my stream.

3881
03:31:14,980 --> 03:31:16,020
Wait, what?

3882
03:31:16,780 --> 03:31:18,220
Wait, you're chilling.

3883
03:31:18,320 --> 03:31:18,940
Wait, it's you.

3884
03:31:19,520 --> 03:31:20,380
Who's you?

3885
03:31:26,310 --> 03:31:27,330
Can you restart it?

3886
03:31:27,670 --> 03:31:29,870
I don't have my OBS anymore.

3887
03:31:30,030 --> 03:31:30,830
It, like, disappeared.

3888
03:31:31,550 --> 03:31:37,810
It actually disappeared everywhere, but, like, background process.

3889
03:31:38,350 --> 03:31:43,750
It's still in my background processes, but, like, it's just gone everywhere else.

3890
03:31:49,080 --> 03:31:50,820
So I have to, like, force quit.

3891
03:31:52,040 --> 03:31:55,600
I literally have to force quit my OBS on Task Manager.

3892
03:32:02,010 --> 03:32:02,910
It's gone!

3893
03:32:03,130 --> 03:32:07,410
I'm looking through Task Manager, and it doesn't exist in, like, regular apps.

3894
03:32:08,750 --> 03:32:16,590
It's not, it's, like, not, and then when I click OBS, when I click OBS, there, it's, like, you already have OBS open.

3895
03:32:16,670 --> 03:32:17,630
Do you want to launch another?

3896
03:32:17,630 --> 03:32:19,510
And then I'm, like, what?

3897
03:32:20,830 --> 03:32:22,330
No, what do you mean?

3898
03:32:22,810 --> 03:32:24,110
Where is it?

3899
03:32:24,230 --> 03:32:25,750
Where is it?

3900
03:32:28,350 --> 03:32:30,630
Oh yeah, I heard they're nerfing Hawkeye and Hela.

3901
03:32:30,750 --> 03:32:31,790
Thank fucking god.

3902
03:32:33,610 --> 03:32:35,810
Yeah, there's nothing on my tray.

3903
03:32:36,630 --> 03:32:37,290
At all.

3904
03:32:39,270 --> 03:32:40,290
I couldn't.

3905
03:32:40,390 --> 03:32:41,850
I can't bring it back to the foreground.

3906
03:32:42,030 --> 03:32:42,950
It doesn't exist.

3907
03:32:43,690 --> 03:32:44,690
I don't know how.

3908
03:32:45,950 --> 03:32:50,570
I don't know how, how, uh...

3909
03:32:50,570 --> 03:32:56,310
We had Mr. Fister, and it was... He did really well in Hawkeye!

3910
03:32:58,710 --> 03:33:01,210
He was really good as Hawkeye, though.

3911
03:33:02,170 --> 03:33:03,330
I don't know what happened.

3912
03:33:04,410 --> 03:33:05,610
He got a little too silly.

3913
03:33:12,170 --> 03:33:13,690
He got a little too silly.

3914
03:33:14,310 --> 03:33:15,770
I think the Wolverine's coming for us.

3915
03:33:23,350 --> 03:33:25,070
I'm a little weird.

3916
03:33:26,170 --> 03:33:27,430
Oh, shit.

3917
03:33:34,100 --> 03:33:34,530
Oh,

3918
03:33:38,010 --> 03:33:38,870
what?

3919
03:33:39,650 --> 03:33:41,330
Where did I get hit?

3920
03:33:45,690 --> 03:33:46,550
What?

3921
03:33:46,550 --> 03:33:49,330
Oh my god, he's insane!

3922
03:33:50,780 --> 03:33:53,010
That was a crazy snipe.

3923
03:33:53,290 --> 03:33:54,330
Holy fuck.

3924
03:33:55,250 --> 03:33:56,730
This is why I always ban Hawkeye.

3925
03:33:57,110 --> 03:33:58,630
This is exactly why.

3926
03:33:58,990 --> 03:34:04,030
I fucking never trust anybody to be like, let's leave Hawkeye open.

3927
03:34:04,870 --> 03:34:06,210
Let's just leave it open.

3928
03:34:06,330 --> 03:34:08,250
What's the worst that could happen, you know?

3929
03:34:08,710 --> 03:34:11,230
What's the worst that could possibly happen?

3930
03:34:12,650 --> 03:34:13,210
I'm gonna get sniped.

3931
03:34:13,310 --> 03:34:13,870
I can feel it.

3932
03:34:14,710 --> 03:34:16,350
I can feel myself get sniped.

3933
03:34:17,390 --> 03:34:18,450
Oh my god.

3934
03:34:19,230 --> 03:34:20,450
I thought I had to use that.

3935
03:34:24,070 --> 03:34:25,630
Oh my god, this is scary.

3936
03:34:25,750 --> 03:34:27,170
I'm like, I don't know where the Hawkeye is.

3937
03:34:27,490 --> 03:34:28,510
I'm so scared.

3938
03:34:28,990 --> 03:34:30,130
I'm actually so scared.

3939
03:34:30,270 --> 03:34:32,010
I don't know where the Hawkeye is.

3940
03:34:32,970 --> 03:34:34,410
I'm so scared.

3941
03:34:35,830 --> 03:34:36,430
I

3942
03:34:39,720 --> 03:34:40,740
don't know.

3943
03:34:41,840 --> 03:34:42,940
I'm so scared.

3944
03:34:43,300 --> 03:34:44,360
I'm so scared.

3945
03:34:44,620 --> 03:34:45,680
I'm so scared.

3946
03:34:46,220 --> 03:34:46,520
I'm...

3947
03:34:48,820 --> 03:34:50,140
I'm so scared.

3948
03:34:50,520 --> 03:34:51,140
Where is he?

3949
03:34:55,320 --> 03:34:56,700
Where is he?

3950
03:34:57,120 --> 03:34:57,880
Where is he?

3951
03:34:59,240 --> 03:35:00,860
I died to him once.

3952
03:35:00,940 --> 03:35:03,040
I don't want it to happen to me again.

3953
03:35:05,060 --> 03:35:06,120
Where'd he go?

3954
03:35:08,600 --> 03:35:09,700
Where'd he go?

3955
03:35:13,550 --> 03:35:13,950
Woah.

3956
03:35:15,450 --> 03:35:16,510
Where'd he go?

3957
03:35:18,050 --> 03:35:18,270
Here.

3958
03:35:23,830 --> 03:35:24,450
What?!

3959
03:35:26,230 --> 03:35:26,540
What?!

3960
03:35:31,630 --> 03:35:32,150
What?!

3961
03:35:32,150 --> 03:35:35,090
Why is it always me?!

3962
03:35:36,830 --> 03:35:40,990
I can't... I saw... He wasn't... I was like, oh he's not looking at me.

3963
03:35:41,050 --> 03:35:42,690
I'll fucking come out of the room.

3964
03:35:43,050 --> 03:35:45,110
I'll... I'll come out of the room!

3965
03:35:48,060 --> 03:35:50,560
I never... I got a bit cocky there.

3966
03:35:50,760 --> 03:35:54,480
I legitimately looked because I thought he wasn't looking at me anymore.

3967
03:35:54,760 --> 03:35:57,660
So I thought I was safe, but you're never safe.

3968
03:35:57,660 --> 03:35:59,140
You're never safe.

3969
03:35:59,220 --> 03:36:00,460
You always have to fear.

3970
03:36:00,660 --> 03:36:01,580
Just fear.

3971
03:36:01,980 --> 03:36:03,040
Just always fear.

3972
03:36:03,540 --> 03:36:07,000
Like, never... never believe in anything.

3973
03:36:07,540 --> 03:36:08,140
Just...

3974
03:36:08,660 --> 03:36:09,300
Never!

3975
03:36:09,720 --> 03:36:10,880
Just never!

3976
03:36:11,280 --> 03:36:13,080
Never believe again!

3977
03:36:14,520 --> 03:36:16,300
Always be paranoid!

3978
03:36:17,020 --> 03:36:18,580
Always be paranoid!

3979
03:36:18,940 --> 03:36:21,120
Always think they're out to get you!

3980
03:36:21,440 --> 03:36:23,860
Always think the government is always watching you!

3981
03:36:23,960 --> 03:36:25,660
Never turn your face around!

3982
03:36:26,660 --> 03:36:28,440
Magneto said, psych!

3983
03:36:30,160 --> 03:36:32,080
The government is always watching!

3984
03:36:32,340 --> 03:36:33,540
Never think you're safe!

3985
03:36:49,260 --> 03:36:49,600
No!

3986
03:36:50,600 --> 03:36:51,140
No!

3987
03:36:53,480 --> 03:36:56,170
3, 2, 1...

3988
03:36:57,640 --> 03:36:58,620
What?!

3989
03:36:59,740 --> 03:37:00,280
Ow!

3990
03:37:01,300 --> 03:37:03,240
I got headshot.

3991
03:37:06,900 --> 03:37:08,420
Oh my god!

3992
03:37:12,960 --> 03:37:14,880
I'm just gonna track everything.

3993
03:37:15,160 --> 03:37:15,660
Fuck it.

3994
03:37:26,460 --> 03:37:27,000
Fear!

3995
03:37:27,220 --> 03:37:27,280
Fear!

3996
03:37:27,500 --> 03:37:27,640
Fear!

3997
03:37:28,080 --> 03:37:28,200
Fear!

3998
03:37:28,320 --> 03:37:28,480
Fear!

3999
03:37:28,520 --> 03:37:28,660
Fear!

4000
03:37:28,740 --> 03:37:28,820
Fear!

4001
03:37:29,040 --> 03:37:30,360
It's not me.

4002
03:37:31,040 --> 03:37:31,800
That's fine.

4003
03:37:32,700 --> 03:37:33,460
It's not me.

4004
03:37:34,680 --> 03:37:35,480
That's fine.

4005
03:37:44,640 --> 03:37:45,520
Not the moon.

4006
03:37:46,560 --> 03:37:47,580
Not the moon.

4007
03:37:48,580 --> 03:37:49,460
Not the moon.

4008
03:37:50,340 --> 03:37:50,900
That's fine.

4009
03:37:50,980 --> 03:37:51,860
It's not just me.

4010
03:37:52,120 --> 03:37:53,340
I'm sorry, Kurova.

4011
03:37:53,580 --> 03:37:55,620
I'm just happy it's not just me.

4012
03:37:55,900 --> 03:37:56,420
I'm...

4013
03:37:57,360 --> 03:37:57,920
Sorry.

4014
03:37:59,580 --> 03:38:00,420
That's a lot.

4015
03:38:00,700 --> 03:38:01,440
I'm sorry.

4016
03:38:01,860 --> 03:38:03,760
It didn't lose us the game at least.

4017
03:38:03,940 --> 03:38:05,440
You know, that's all that matters.

4018
03:38:07,420 --> 03:38:09,220
That's all that matters.

4019
03:38:09,900 --> 03:38:10,800
At last!

4020
03:38:11,920 --> 03:38:13,060
At last!

4021
03:38:13,200 --> 03:38:14,760
It's not just...

4022
03:38:14,760 --> 03:38:15,700
There's a Starlord above.

4023
03:38:19,180 --> 03:38:24,400
I have to reload.

4024
03:38:30,800 --> 03:38:32,760
I'm just happy.

4025
03:38:37,940 --> 03:38:41,200
Oh, at least the Magneto targets other healers.

4026
03:38:41,640 --> 03:38:42,060
You know?

4027
03:38:43,060 --> 03:38:44,200
You know?

4028
03:38:46,820 --> 03:38:47,780
Oh

4029
03:38:53,090 --> 03:38:55,850
my god.

4030
03:38:59,720 --> 03:39:01,340
Oh my god.

4031
03:39:03,910 --> 03:39:05,110
That's fine.

4032
03:39:07,510 --> 03:39:09,070
No, I'm just healing.

4033
03:39:09,630 --> 03:39:10,530
Just heal!

4034
03:39:14,370 --> 03:39:15,830
That's fine.

4035
03:39:16,690 --> 03:39:18,130
That's fine.

4036
03:39:18,290 --> 03:39:20,370
He never misses, guys.

4037
03:39:20,370 --> 03:39:23,330
And I don't want to be there for it.

4038
03:39:23,350 --> 03:39:25,510
3, 2, 1.

4039
03:39:31,010 --> 03:39:32,730
No, no, no.

4040
03:39:36,730 --> 03:39:43,310
Oh my god.

4041
03:39:43,530 --> 03:39:46,470
He fumbled it.

4042
03:39:47,350 --> 03:39:48,150
Thank god.

4043
03:39:51,230 --> 03:39:52,530
Thank fucking god.

4044
03:39:55,830 --> 03:39:57,850
Oh, thank fucking god.

4045
03:40:02,470 --> 03:40:04,370
I don't think they've never played...

4046
03:40:05,370 --> 03:40:08,910
My stack might have had the fucking hardest games of their lives trying to play with me.

4047
03:40:18,310 --> 03:40:24,810
They might have just played a tournament, but this might be the hardest thing they've ever done.

4048
03:40:27,330 --> 03:40:28,910
This could be it.

4049
03:40:30,590 --> 03:40:33,430
This could be the hardest thing they've ever tried to do.

4050
03:40:36,950 --> 03:40:39,190
Playing with me is the training, wait.

4051
03:40:40,070 --> 03:40:45,290
If they can survive playing with Toad Keeper, they can win the next tournament.

4052
03:40:53,590 --> 03:40:57,770
They're like, this is just gonna be a casual fun time, right everybody?

4053
03:40:58,370 --> 03:41:01,130
Suddenly sweats their fucking ass off.

4054
03:41:05,880 --> 03:41:10,880
The battle starts in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

4055
03:41:12,660 --> 03:41:15,220
Don't forget, securing the mission area is crucial.

4056
03:41:15,220 --> 03:41:23,300
If they're truly top 100 in the world, then they should be able to do this.

4057
03:41:23,920 --> 03:41:24,960
Here they come.

4058
03:41:31,030 --> 03:41:32,690
It's Kurova.

4059
03:41:33,970 --> 03:41:34,630
What?

4060
03:41:35,610 --> 03:41:35,890
What?

4061
03:41:36,630 --> 03:41:36,810
What?

4062
03:41:37,050 --> 03:41:37,790
Wait, I'm...

4063
03:41:46,010 --> 03:41:47,410
Oh...

4064
03:41:47,410 --> 03:41:50,790
Guys, what the...

4065
03:41:51,710 --> 03:41:53,130
What was that?

4066
03:41:57,090 --> 03:42:02,590
What was that?

4067
03:42:02,590 --> 03:42:04,730
What was that?

4068
03:42:06,350 --> 03:42:07,970
I'm so confused.

4069
03:42:08,510 --> 03:42:10,410
Why couldn't I fit the door?

4070
03:42:12,390 --> 03:42:14,350
Sorry, Luna's too dumpy.

4071
03:42:16,370 --> 03:42:18,290
You all saw it.

4072
03:42:19,250 --> 03:42:21,670
You all saw what I saw.

4073
03:42:22,390 --> 03:42:23,390
What was that?

4074
03:42:24,370 --> 03:42:26,570
I literally was so confused.

4075
03:42:29,250 --> 03:42:30,650
I was like, what happened?

4076
03:42:31,350 --> 03:42:33,410
Was my dumpy too thick?

4077
03:42:33,950 --> 03:42:35,110
Too thick.

4078
03:42:39,230 --> 03:42:44,630
That was the weirdest TP of my fucking life.

4079
03:42:45,210 --> 03:42:48,810
Like, everybody else entered the TP.

4080
03:42:51,370 --> 03:42:53,410
They're like, what happened?

4081
03:42:55,290 --> 03:42:56,910
What the fuck happened?

4082
03:43:04,120 --> 03:43:05,540
Okay, hey guys.

4083
03:43:05,540 --> 03:43:08,000
There's like a Starlord raid on...

4084
03:43:13,120 --> 03:43:14,080
Whoa.

4085
03:43:19,320 --> 03:43:21,140
We got too thick.

4086
03:43:26,280 --> 03:43:26,760
Yay!

4087
03:43:30,920 --> 03:43:34,380
You must be skilled to use...

4088
03:43:34,380 --> 03:43:35,980
Does anyone have a clip of that?

4089
03:43:37,240 --> 03:43:37,680
Like...

4090
03:43:38,440 --> 03:43:40,240
Like, does anyone have a...

4091
03:43:40,240 --> 03:43:41,720
Someone give me a clip of that.

4092
03:43:41,780 --> 03:43:43,200
That was such a fucking...

4093
03:43:43,200 --> 03:43:45,680
I walked straight.

4094
03:43:49,200 --> 03:43:50,860
Legitimately, like, what happened?

4095
03:43:52,120 --> 03:43:53,160
I'm like, huh?

4096
03:43:55,480 --> 03:43:56,980
Can we get a replay of that?

4097
03:43:57,120 --> 03:43:58,220
Yeah, I'm looking at this clip.

4098
03:43:58,320 --> 03:43:59,560
I need to know what the fuck happened.

4099
03:44:02,020 --> 03:44:02,900
I'm like...

4100
03:44:03,880 --> 03:44:05,580
I'm walking straight.

4101
03:44:06,000 --> 03:44:08,300
Like, what's going on?

4102
03:44:12,700 --> 03:44:15,300
It's like, you cannot enter.

4103
03:44:15,760 --> 03:44:17,520
I guess I must just do a thing.

4104
03:44:18,260 --> 03:44:20,280
Like, what the fuck?

4105
03:44:20,700 --> 03:44:23,380
Literally just walked in.

4106
03:44:23,740 --> 03:44:25,700
They're like, we know you're not.

4107
03:44:25,760 --> 03:44:27,360
You don't deserve to be...

4108
03:44:27,360 --> 03:44:29,680
We found a YouTuber.

4109
03:44:30,440 --> 03:44:31,760
They're like, you can...

4110
03:44:31,760 --> 03:44:36,480
This portal is only accessible to all the real Twitch streamers out there.

4111
03:44:36,660 --> 03:44:38,000
And then they found out.

4112
03:44:38,200 --> 03:44:38,720
They knew.

4113
03:44:39,460 --> 03:44:40,700
I wasn't worthy enough.

4114
03:44:41,040 --> 03:44:44,160
Why is everybody so mean to me?

4115
03:44:46,880 --> 03:44:49,000
The dibs almost got me.

4116
03:44:49,380 --> 03:44:49,940
What's up, you're back.

4117
03:44:50,000 --> 03:44:51,160
I'm gonna use the bathroom, guys.

4118
03:46:11,080 --> 03:46:11,920
I'm back.

4119
03:46:12,140 --> 03:46:13,320
And I got myself a banana!

4120
03:46:14,280 --> 03:46:15,600
I need to make sure I eat these bananas.

4121
03:46:15,600 --> 03:46:17,020
Because I keep...

4122
03:46:17,020 --> 03:46:19,620
The last time I bought a banana, I forgot about...

4123
03:46:19,620 --> 03:46:20,140
I'm sorry.

4124
03:46:20,200 --> 03:46:22,620
I'm gonna give you guys some girl fail right now.

4125
03:46:23,500 --> 03:46:25,200
I'm trying to remember to eat my bananas.

4126
03:46:25,820 --> 03:46:29,140
Because the last time I got a banana, I forgot about it.

4127
03:46:30,140 --> 03:46:32,640
And you know what happens when you forget about you having bananas?

4128
03:46:39,840 --> 03:46:40,720
They go...

4129
03:46:40,720 --> 03:46:41,780
Yeah, they go bad.

4130
03:46:42,020 --> 03:46:43,480
Have you ever seen a bad banana?

4131
03:46:44,840 --> 03:46:46,700
I didn't realize you can turn black.

4132
03:47:03,880 --> 03:47:05,780
I forgot I had bananas.

4133
03:47:06,060 --> 03:47:06,680
No, I forgot.

4134
03:47:06,900 --> 03:47:09,620
I had it, like, stored in this corner.

4135
03:47:10,440 --> 03:47:11,940
And I forgot about it.

4136
03:47:11,940 --> 03:47:15,040
I legitimately forgot about these bananas.

4137
03:47:15,400 --> 03:47:18,060
So, like, I bought groceries, like, three days ago.

4138
03:47:18,660 --> 03:47:22,640
And I was like, gotta remember to eat these bananas this time.

4139
03:47:24,500 --> 03:47:25,380
I didn't smell.

4140
03:47:25,620 --> 03:47:25,940
I couldn't...

4141
03:47:26,640 --> 03:47:28,280
To be fair, my nose...

4142
03:47:28,280 --> 03:47:29,560
Um, I don't have COVID.

4143
03:47:30,020 --> 03:47:30,940
I just, um...

4144
03:47:32,520 --> 03:47:35,400
My nose, for smelling, isn't that good.

4145
03:47:35,840 --> 03:47:37,240
So, like...

4146
03:47:37,240 --> 03:47:37,960
I can smell...

4147
03:47:37,960 --> 03:47:40,380
I do often smell, like, some scents.

4148
03:47:40,380 --> 03:47:43,100
But I can't catch it, as well as other...

4149
03:47:43,100 --> 03:47:44,120
I can't, like...

4150
03:47:44,120 --> 03:47:45,800
In terms of, like, an average person.

4151
03:47:46,220 --> 03:47:47,740
So, like...

4152
03:47:47,740 --> 03:47:49,180
And this is, like, really strong.

4153
03:47:49,580 --> 03:47:51,900
So, like, I didn't smell any of the...

4154
03:47:51,900 --> 03:47:52,400
The...

4155
03:47:52,400 --> 03:47:54,740
I didn't smell the fucking rotten banana.

4156
03:48:01,940 --> 03:48:02,380
So...

4157
03:48:02,980 --> 03:48:03,420
Um...

4158
03:48:03,420 --> 03:48:04,580
No, it's...

4159
03:48:05,060 --> 03:48:06,000
You know how I know it was...

4160
03:48:06,000 --> 03:48:07,900
By the way, the black is still good?

4161
03:48:09,240 --> 03:48:09,680
Um...

4162
03:48:09,680 --> 03:48:14,320
Not when it melted out of the fucking banana peel!

4163
03:48:20,200 --> 03:48:23,280
It melted out of the banana.

4164
03:48:23,660 --> 03:48:26,300
So, I knew it was bad, bad.

4165
03:48:26,880 --> 03:48:27,340
I...

4166
03:48:29,840 --> 03:48:33,180
That's definitely a really bad banana.

4167
03:48:37,560 --> 03:48:38,840
But I'm okay now.

4168
03:48:38,840 --> 03:48:40,600
Now I'm eating my bananas, cause I...

4169
03:48:40,600 --> 03:48:41,640
No, it's cause I forgot!

4170
03:48:41,820 --> 03:48:44,900
I forgot I bought bananas, cause I stuffed it in a corner.

4171
03:48:46,100 --> 03:48:47,620
So, I forgot about it.

4172
03:48:48,660 --> 03:48:49,840
And then, like...

4173
03:48:52,420 --> 03:48:53,460
And then I noticed...

4174
03:48:53,460 --> 03:48:55,500
I was like, what is that over there?

4175
03:48:56,200 --> 03:48:58,480
I was like, oh yeah, fuck, those are the bananas I bought.

4176
03:48:59,560 --> 03:49:00,820
And I was like...

4177
03:49:00,820 --> 03:49:01,740
Oh, fuck.

4178
03:49:01,920 --> 03:49:02,480
And then...

4179
03:49:02,480 --> 03:49:03,380
I was like...

4180
03:49:03,380 --> 03:49:04,360
I picked up the...

4181
03:49:04,360 --> 03:49:07,100
The most fucked up part...

4182
03:49:08,920 --> 03:49:09,880
Is that...

4183
03:49:10,500 --> 03:49:12,420
It was in a plastic bag.

4184
03:49:12,760 --> 03:49:13,120
You know?

4185
03:49:13,300 --> 03:49:16,080
Cause when you get bananas, you put it in a plastic bag, right?

4186
03:49:16,500 --> 03:49:17,260
Like you would do.

4187
03:49:18,200 --> 03:49:20,600
It melted through the plastic bag.

4188
03:49:21,100 --> 03:49:22,880
Cause I thought nothing was wrong.

4189
03:49:23,440 --> 03:49:24,960
I thought nothing was wrong with my bananas.

4190
03:49:25,920 --> 03:49:29,880
I was just like, oh, it's just old, so I'm just gonna throw that bag away.

4191
03:49:30,580 --> 03:49:31,740
I picked it up.

4192
03:49:32,420 --> 03:49:35,620
And then there was like, brown sludge at the bottom.

4193
03:49:35,620 --> 03:49:38,480
And I was like, oh, it's bad, bad.

4194
03:49:42,980 --> 03:49:44,800
It's bad, bad.

4195
03:49:45,240 --> 03:49:46,800
It went through the bag.

4196
03:49:53,860 --> 03:49:55,720
I don't even...

4197
03:49:55,720 --> 03:49:57,380
Like, I don't even know how the...

4198
03:49:57,380 --> 03:50:00,000
Why is Karoma's item targeted so hard?

4199
03:50:03,400 --> 03:50:08,800
I feel like every time I watch Karoma stream, he gets to play Adam.

4200
03:50:09,020 --> 03:50:11,200
Like, what the fuck is wrong with my...

4201
03:50:14,960 --> 03:50:16,420
Yeah, I feel like...

4202
03:50:16,420 --> 03:50:20,500
How come every time I watch his streams, he gets to play Adam?

4203
03:50:21,980 --> 03:50:25,480
And now that he's playing with me, he doesn't get to play Adam.

4204
03:50:29,020 --> 03:50:29,980
Well, you see, dude.

4205
03:50:29,980 --> 03:50:30,220
I'm joking.

4206
03:50:30,900 --> 03:50:33,620
There's one main factor in all of this.

4207
03:50:37,840 --> 03:50:38,440
Okay.

4208
03:50:39,740 --> 03:50:41,640
Alright, me too, but that's okay.

4209
03:50:44,820 --> 03:50:47,540
That's alright, me too, but that's okay.

4210
03:50:55,660 --> 03:50:57,660
No, we're not playing Rocky Raccoon.

4211
03:50:57,720 --> 03:51:00,660
I'd rather cut off my head than play Rocky Raccoon.

4212
03:51:00,660 --> 03:51:04,120
Because even with my hands cut off, I can still play that character.

4213
03:51:04,300 --> 03:51:06,080
Oh yeah, speaking of Rocky Raccoon.

4214
03:51:06,380 --> 03:51:09,540
One of the Rocky Raccoon players I, like, fucking roasted.

4215
03:51:10,100 --> 03:51:11,260
But it was not him.

4216
03:51:11,360 --> 03:51:12,040
It's just in general.

4217
03:51:12,140 --> 03:51:13,320
I just hate all Raccoon players.

4218
03:51:13,460 --> 03:51:13,740
So it's...

4219
03:51:13,740 --> 03:51:14,720
It's not...

4220
03:51:14,720 --> 03:51:16,280
It's technically not targeted.

4221
03:51:16,800 --> 03:51:19,920
It's literally me just hating a specific group of people.

4222
03:51:20,240 --> 03:51:21,120
So he's not...

4223
03:51:21,120 --> 03:51:22,340
It's like I hate all of them.

4224
03:51:22,940 --> 03:51:23,380
So...

4225
03:51:24,440 --> 03:51:26,020
It doesn't make it better.

4226
03:51:26,420 --> 03:51:28,340
But I just need him to know that.

4227
03:51:28,640 --> 03:51:30,240
But, like, he added me.

4228
03:51:32,680 --> 03:51:33,200
He...

4229
03:51:33,200 --> 03:51:35,960
He added me.

4230
03:51:37,360 --> 03:51:37,880
So...

4231
03:51:39,020 --> 03:51:40,160
Sorry, not people.

4232
03:51:40,600 --> 03:51:41,920
A certain group of rodents.

4233
03:51:42,100 --> 03:51:43,880
I think that makes me sound a little better.

4234
03:51:44,020 --> 03:51:45,820
I just realized that sounded really bad.

4235
03:51:46,140 --> 03:51:48,660
But, like, a particular group of rodents.

4236
03:51:51,580 --> 03:51:52,380
Um, anyway.

4237
03:51:52,820 --> 03:51:55,360
So, he added me on Marvel Rivals.

4238
03:51:55,820 --> 03:51:57,560
But, like, it was right aft...

4239
03:51:57,560 --> 03:51:59,640
It was, like, a day after.

4240
03:51:59,640 --> 03:52:01,660
So I think he watched the stream.

4241
03:52:01,720 --> 03:52:04,620
And he wants to know, like, what the fuck is wrong with me.

4242
03:52:06,860 --> 03:52:07,900
They're not!

4243
03:52:08,080 --> 03:52:09,400
They're raccoons!

4244
03:52:12,940 --> 03:52:14,140
They're raccoons!

4245
03:52:17,740 --> 03:52:19,800
They're not even real!

4246
03:52:21,580 --> 03:52:23,980
They're not even real raccoons!

4247
03:52:26,320 --> 03:52:26,920
Oh...

4248
03:52:30,350 --> 03:52:30,730
Okay.

4249
03:52:30,730 --> 03:52:32,330
That's fine.

4250
03:52:34,530 --> 03:52:35,530
That's fine.

4251
03:52:39,300 --> 03:52:40,640
Oh my god.

4252
03:52:42,300 --> 03:52:42,980
Oh...

4253
03:52:43,880 --> 03:52:45,060
This is bad.

4254
03:52:46,160 --> 03:52:46,920
I mean, we're even.

4255
03:52:47,460 --> 03:52:48,140
Nevermind.

4256
03:52:51,180 --> 03:52:51,520
Like...

4257
03:52:51,860 --> 03:52:54,040
I don't know what's going on.

4258
03:53:00,000 --> 03:53:01,480
I'm going to help with this.

4259
03:53:03,800 --> 03:53:05,020
He's asleep, he's asleep.

4260
03:53:05,740 --> 03:53:08,020
I am ready to put on a show!

4261
03:53:10,240 --> 03:53:11,180
Feel better?

4262
03:53:11,420 --> 03:53:11,960
Oh my god.

4263
03:53:13,540 --> 03:53:15,320
We are undefeated!

4264
03:53:15,320 --> 03:53:15,700
Do it!

4265
03:53:15,860 --> 03:53:16,140
Do it!

4266
03:53:16,240 --> 03:53:16,440
Yeah!

4267
03:53:20,820 --> 03:53:21,140
Oh.

4268
03:53:21,820 --> 03:53:22,480
Not yeah.

4269
03:53:23,040 --> 03:53:23,680
Yeah!

4270
03:53:29,970 --> 03:53:30,950
That's right!

4271
03:53:34,690 --> 03:53:35,690
I'm happy.

4272
03:53:37,350 --> 03:53:38,770
I saw him use...

4273
03:53:38,770 --> 03:53:40,370
I saw him hit that mantis.

4274
03:53:41,930 --> 03:53:44,330
He has no fear for you.

4275
03:53:45,670 --> 03:53:45,890
Oh.

4276
03:53:46,050 --> 03:53:47,430
That's not what I wanted him to target.

4277
03:53:50,110 --> 03:53:51,350
I wanted him to hit...

4278
03:53:55,800 --> 03:53:56,340
Whoa!

4279
03:53:57,400 --> 03:53:58,240
I can't...

4280
03:53:58,240 --> 03:53:58,920
That's not cool.

4281
03:54:00,540 --> 03:54:02,040
That's not cool at all.

4282
03:54:03,680 --> 03:54:05,260
That's not cool at all.

4283
03:54:07,980 --> 03:54:08,660
There's a...

4284
03:54:08,660 --> 03:54:09,800
There's a train just walking up to me.

4285
03:54:10,860 --> 03:54:11,560
My god.

4286
03:54:12,620 --> 03:54:16,120
Why did they let him walk up to me like that?!

4287
03:54:19,000 --> 03:54:20,960
They just let it happen!

4288
03:54:23,040 --> 03:54:26,120
I was like, guys, he's walking up to me very slowly.

4289
03:54:29,260 --> 03:54:31,060
Very fucking slowly.

4290
03:54:36,020 --> 03:54:37,000
Oh my god.

4291
03:54:37,120 --> 03:54:39,920
Miffy, you guys can, like, do something?

4292
03:54:42,760 --> 03:54:43,440
Maybe.

4293
03:54:49,040 --> 03:54:50,540
Maybe they heard you.

4294
03:54:54,710 --> 03:54:55,290
No, guys.

4295
03:54:55,510 --> 03:54:55,830
Guys.

4296
03:54:58,550 --> 03:54:59,230
Strange.

4297
03:54:59,310 --> 03:54:59,590
Strange.

4298
03:54:59,970 --> 03:55:01,170
I'm like, guys.

4299
03:55:01,730 --> 03:55:04,170
Guys, he's walking up to me.

4300
03:55:04,370 --> 03:55:04,830
Guys.

4301
03:55:05,890 --> 03:55:07,730
Fuck me, I guess.

4302
03:55:10,750 --> 03:55:12,510
He's not good in high elo.

4303
03:55:13,970 --> 03:55:14,910
Like, he's not...

4304
03:55:14,910 --> 03:55:16,810
Like, everybody prefers Mantis Luna.

4305
03:55:17,190 --> 03:55:21,130
Because if the enemy team has Mantis Luna, it's just like...

4306
03:55:21,130 --> 03:55:22,750
It favors...

4307
03:55:22,750 --> 03:55:26,730
It favors the enemy team more than your own team.

4308
03:55:28,370 --> 03:55:28,990
Sacrificing...

4309
03:55:29,650 --> 03:55:31,310
Sacrificing two defensive ults.

4310
03:55:32,350 --> 03:55:33,650
Emmie, thank you for the Twitch prize.

4311
03:55:33,730 --> 03:55:34,510
Thank you, thank you.

4312
03:55:34,870 --> 03:55:36,370
Rabbit, thank you for the tier one.

4313
03:55:36,890 --> 03:55:38,170
Dish, thank you for the Twitch prize.

4314
03:55:38,350 --> 03:55:39,050
Thank you, thank you.

4315
03:55:42,850 --> 03:55:43,530
That's alright.

4316
03:55:45,390 --> 03:55:47,110
And now we have a Wolverine.

4317
03:55:47,390 --> 03:55:48,410
It'll be different, right?

4318
03:55:49,550 --> 03:55:51,290
It'll be so different.

4319
03:55:53,750 --> 03:55:54,890
Now we get to watch...

4320
03:55:54,890 --> 03:55:55,510
I don't...

4321
03:55:56,250 --> 03:55:58,070
I don't know about that.

4322
03:55:59,390 --> 03:56:00,970
Our games have been...

4323
03:56:00,970 --> 03:56:04,170
Our games have been pretty...

4324
03:56:04,170 --> 03:56:04,170
Wait.

4325
03:56:06,010 --> 03:56:06,910
I need help here.

4326
03:56:10,410 --> 03:56:12,050
I slept Wolverine, I slept Wolverine.

4327
03:56:12,950 --> 03:56:13,170
Oh.

4328
03:56:14,050 --> 03:56:14,410
Oh.

4329
03:56:17,370 --> 03:56:19,170
I'm ult... I'm ulting this?

4330
03:56:24,060 --> 03:56:24,600
Come on!

4331
03:56:25,020 --> 03:56:26,860
He's so... Oh my god, he's so low!

4332
03:56:29,780 --> 03:56:31,780
He doesn't see me here, right?

4333
03:56:33,360 --> 03:56:34,800
Guess I gotta go down here.

4334
03:56:37,340 --> 03:56:38,380
Which one?

4335
03:56:42,480 --> 03:56:44,060
I slept him, I slept him.

4336
03:56:46,980 --> 03:56:49,640
I don't have leaves, I'm sorry.

4337
03:56:55,440 --> 03:56:56,800
Oh my god.

4338
03:56:59,080 --> 03:57:00,720
Oh my god!

4339
03:57:01,760 --> 03:57:03,460
That was scary.

4340
03:57:04,720 --> 03:57:06,360
That was... Like, what happened?

4341
03:57:06,900 --> 03:57:08,820
What happened?

4342
03:57:09,420 --> 03:57:09,960
What happened?

4343
03:57:11,720 --> 03:57:14,600
I don't even know what fucking happened.

4344
03:57:16,500 --> 03:57:18,540
I slept him, I slept him.

4345
03:57:21,700 --> 03:57:26,600
He'll be fine.

4346
03:57:31,510 --> 03:57:32,750
Oh my god.

4347
03:57:36,290 --> 03:57:38,390
It's fine, everything is fine.

4348
03:57:39,250 --> 03:57:40,990
Everything is so fine.

4349
03:57:45,380 --> 03:57:46,060
It's okay.

4350
03:57:48,020 --> 03:57:50,130
We're... I feel so healthy.

4351
03:57:54,060 --> 03:57:55,040
I'm damage boosted to you?

4352
03:57:59,840 --> 03:58:00,420
Fight him!

4353
03:58:01,900 --> 03:58:03,260
Wait, they're on point, they're on point.

4354
03:58:04,620 --> 03:58:06,300
They're on point.

4355
03:58:07,640 --> 03:58:08,980
I slept somebody.

4356
03:58:12,260 --> 03:58:13,560
I'm ulting, oh no!

4357
03:58:14,480 --> 03:58:17,660
Oh my god, I got my ult off too!

4358
03:58:20,260 --> 03:58:20,740
How?!

4359
03:58:20,740 --> 03:58:21,840
Where did he go?!

4360
03:58:21,840 --> 03:58:28,720
What the f- I lost my ult, I'm so sad.

4361
03:58:29,180 --> 03:58:30,960
I should've feared, I should've feared.

4362
03:58:31,080 --> 03:58:32,960
I don't know why I thought I could do it.

4363
03:58:32,960 --> 03:58:35,160
The one time I stopped fearing...

4364
03:58:36,200 --> 03:58:40,280
The one time, the one time I stopped fearing, of course.

4365
03:58:40,920 --> 03:58:43,880
Oh my god, I saw that, that was crazy.

4366
03:58:44,680 --> 03:58:46,240
That's actually crazy.

4367
03:58:48,720 --> 03:58:50,960
What the fuck is wrong with you?!

4368
03:58:54,500 --> 03:58:55,220
Like...

4369
03:58:55,220 --> 03:58:58,600
Oh my god, what is wrong with-

4370
03:59:04,060 --> 03:59:05,340
You're nothing!

4371
03:59:06,760 --> 03:59:09,120
I need to start fearing more, guys.

4372
03:59:10,080 --> 03:59:11,600
I need to...

4373
03:59:12,320 --> 03:59:15,100
I need to start fearing more, guys.

4374
03:59:15,760 --> 03:59:19,840
The one time, I was like, things will be okay, right?

4375
03:59:21,500 --> 03:59:22,140
Things...

4376
03:59:23,040 --> 03:59:25,220
Things will be okay.

4377
03:59:27,060 --> 03:59:28,400
I slept him, I slept him.

4378
03:59:30,800 --> 03:59:31,860
I got him.

4379
03:59:31,860 --> 03:59:32,820
Oh, wait.

4380
03:59:33,020 --> 03:59:33,440
No!

4381
03:59:40,200 --> 03:59:40,960
No!

4382
03:59:46,610 --> 03:59:48,290
We're well, it's okay.

4383
03:59:49,290 --> 03:59:51,550
No, I have to start fearing, guys.

4384
03:59:52,070 --> 03:59:53,790
I have to...

4385
03:59:53,790 --> 03:59:55,990
I need to start fearing.

4386
03:59:56,450 --> 04:00:01,770
Why did I stop fearing?

4387
04:00:02,270 --> 04:00:04,210
Why would you stop?

4388
04:00:04,290 --> 04:00:05,630
I don't know why!

4389
04:00:05,630 --> 04:00:07,770
I don't know!

4390
04:00:08,330 --> 04:00:12,490
For one moment of my life, I was like, maybe it's not that bad.

4391
04:00:12,990 --> 04:00:13,690
Maybe...

4392
04:00:13,690 --> 04:00:14,630
Maybe...

4393
04:00:17,450 --> 04:00:19,630
I was just like, maybe...

4394
04:00:20,350 --> 04:00:21,870
Maybe things will be okay.

4395
04:00:25,170 --> 04:00:26,790
New fear.

4396
04:00:27,170 --> 04:00:28,330
Start fearing.

4397
04:00:30,430 --> 04:00:31,810
New fear.

4398
04:00:33,070 --> 04:00:37,210
I think they're gonna realize, after playing with me...

4399
04:00:37,810 --> 04:00:40,270
They're gonna love their team so much more.

4400
04:00:48,190 --> 04:00:51,190
I'm like, I'm like the friendship test.

4401
04:00:52,970 --> 04:00:54,210
I'm literally...

4402
04:00:55,030 --> 04:00:56,270
I'm literally...

4403
04:00:56,270 --> 04:00:58,730
This is also what they're like, do you wanna join the discord call?

4404
04:00:59,290 --> 04:00:59,880
I was like...

4405
04:00:59,880 --> 04:01:04,760
I feel like, you need to let out your frustrations privately.

4406
04:01:11,660 --> 04:01:15,880
It might be too hard to pretend you're okay, but I'm like...

4407
04:01:20,640 --> 04:01:24,360
Before the session, they're like, do you wanna join the call?

4408
04:01:24,460 --> 04:01:25,900
I'm like, hmm...

4409
04:01:29,340 --> 04:01:32,120
Maybe it's better if I'm not in the call.

4410
04:01:35,440 --> 04:01:38,480
They can say whatever they want privately.

4411
04:01:38,920 --> 04:01:40,700
Not in front of an audience.

4412
04:01:46,060 --> 04:01:46,540
Yeah.

4413
04:01:49,020 --> 04:01:50,940
Dude, they're gonna start drinking because of me.

4414
04:01:51,200 --> 04:01:51,680
Yippee!

4415
04:01:51,880 --> 04:01:52,480
No, wait, no.

4416
04:01:52,680 --> 04:01:53,560
Guys, no.

4417
04:01:53,660 --> 04:01:54,360
No yippee.

4418
04:01:54,580 --> 04:01:55,420
No yippee.

4419
04:01:55,420 --> 04:01:56,660
No yippee.

4420
04:01:57,000 --> 04:01:58,780
No yippee.

4421
04:01:59,360 --> 04:02:05,180
Guys, I'm not gonna ruin a person's life because of Marvel Rivals.

4422
04:02:05,860 --> 04:02:08,900
I'm gonna ruin my own life because of Marvel Rivals.

4423
04:02:13,340 --> 04:02:14,900
Guys, no yippee.

4424
04:02:15,100 --> 04:02:15,630
No yippee.

4425
04:02:28,140 --> 04:02:32,100
Yay, I'm a problem for someone else other than myself.

4426
04:02:34,240 --> 04:02:35,560
Let's go!

4427
04:02:39,520 --> 04:02:40,660
Let me see that.

4428
04:02:40,960 --> 04:02:41,880
Still no stream.

4429
04:02:42,700 --> 04:02:46,780
Guys, he has to keep the private frustrations private.

4430
04:02:55,410 --> 04:02:56,710
They're worried.

4431
04:03:03,840 --> 04:03:04,900
Alright, guys.

4432
04:03:05,180 --> 04:03:06,320
Let's make a bet.

4433
04:03:07,320 --> 04:03:08,460
Let's make a prediction.

4434
04:03:09,340 --> 04:03:10,940
When do you think they'll tap out?

4435
04:03:24,980 --> 04:03:27,860
That's fucked up.

4436
04:03:28,840 --> 04:03:31,560
I give him four more hours.

4437
04:03:36,420 --> 04:03:38,760
Three more games.

4438
04:03:40,720 --> 04:03:42,960
Alright, keep me up and I kill them.

4439
04:03:45,240 --> 04:03:47,100
When do you think the stack...

4440
04:03:47,100 --> 04:03:49,420
When do you think the stack will disband?

4441
04:03:51,560 --> 04:03:54,760
We've been playing for four hours and we're fucking...

4442
04:03:55,660 --> 04:03:56,560
Holy shit.

4443
04:04:01,360 --> 04:04:02,540
It's okay, guys.

4444
04:04:04,340 --> 04:04:05,620
What are we betting on?

4445
04:04:05,740 --> 04:04:06,840
Alright, let me do a prediction.

4446
04:04:06,940 --> 04:04:08,400
I haven't done a prediction in a long time.

4447
04:04:09,080 --> 04:04:09,580
Prediction.

4448
04:04:11,380 --> 04:04:12,600
Wait, how do I...

4449
04:04:12,600 --> 04:04:13,360
How do I do prediction?

4450
04:04:14,520 --> 04:04:15,540
Alright, mine.

4451
04:04:15,920 --> 04:04:16,280
Prediction.

4452
04:04:16,400 --> 04:04:17,580
This is what my prediction is.

4453
04:04:17,760 --> 04:04:19,840
The prediction is like...

4454
04:04:20,380 --> 04:04:20,960
Prediction.

4455
04:04:22,100 --> 04:04:26,200
Do you think they'll tap out or commit to the grind?

4456
04:04:26,720 --> 04:04:28,320
And then we'll predict that.

4457
04:04:29,940 --> 04:04:33,080
And then the option is they'll tap out.

4458
04:04:33,940 --> 04:04:35,580
In three games.

4459
04:04:35,960 --> 04:04:40,320
Or like, they'll tap out or they're here for the long haul.

4460
04:04:41,840 --> 04:04:42,460
No, no.

4461
04:04:42,560 --> 04:04:43,480
We should have predictions.

4462
04:04:44,760 --> 04:04:47,400
I know I have one mod awake, I think.

4463
04:04:48,720 --> 04:04:49,240
No, prediction.

4464
04:04:49,540 --> 04:04:50,400
Bet your fake money.

4465
04:04:50,580 --> 04:04:51,980
I want you to bet your fake money.

4466
04:04:52,100 --> 04:04:53,340
I want people to go bankrupt.

4467
04:04:59,420 --> 04:05:00,660
But like, in-game.

4468
04:05:00,800 --> 04:05:01,540
Fictional money.

4469
04:05:01,740 --> 04:05:02,560
Not like actual...

4470
04:05:04,000 --> 04:05:06,560
Guys, fictional money bankrupt.

4471
04:05:08,700 --> 04:05:11,340
I don't want people to actually...

4472
04:05:12,040 --> 04:05:13,620
Wait, there's a mantis behind us asleep.

4473
04:05:15,620 --> 04:05:16,720
We got mantis.

4474
04:05:23,280 --> 04:05:24,240
Come on, Hulk.

4475
04:05:27,730 --> 04:05:29,250
Oh, not anymore.

4476
04:05:29,390 --> 04:05:30,810
I'm fucking scared of her.

4477
04:05:34,150 --> 04:05:37,810
Oh my god, Aaron, thank you for the 100 gifted subs!

4478
04:05:37,990 --> 04:05:39,170
Thank you, thank you!

4479
04:05:41,980 --> 04:05:43,660
Oh my god, did you guys see that?

4480
04:05:44,020 --> 04:05:45,040
I really appreciate it.

4481
04:05:45,120 --> 04:05:47,620
Thank you for supporting this.

4482
04:05:47,700 --> 04:05:48,800
I really appreciate it.

4483
04:05:48,840 --> 04:05:49,500
Thank you so much!

4484
04:05:53,270 --> 04:05:55,770
Oh my god, thank you for the 100 gifted!

4485
04:05:58,170 --> 04:06:01,990
Even if we don't have ELO gains, at least...

4486
04:06:01,990 --> 04:06:03,510
Oh, there's a Namor below me.

4487
04:06:04,550 --> 04:06:06,030
Oh, there's Namor!

4488
04:06:08,550 --> 04:06:10,670
I got fucking Namor'd!

4489
04:06:12,050 --> 04:06:13,170
I was like, what?

4490
04:06:13,650 --> 04:06:15,210
What is he doing there?

4491
04:06:16,470 --> 04:06:16,950
That's alright.

4492
04:06:17,170 --> 04:06:19,270
I traded my life for subs.

4493
04:06:19,270 --> 04:06:21,610
Okay, I need to vlog.

4494
04:06:21,730 --> 04:06:22,830
I need to not look at chat.

4495
04:06:24,190 --> 04:06:24,770
Sorry!

4496
04:06:25,250 --> 04:06:29,490
I looked at chat, so I'm sorry, but thank you so much.

4497
04:06:30,210 --> 04:06:31,870
I really appreciate it.

4498
04:06:34,610 --> 04:06:35,850
Oh my god.

4499
04:06:39,620 --> 04:06:40,200
Whoa!

4500
04:06:41,220 --> 04:06:42,500
I can't see you.

4501
04:06:44,880 --> 04:06:46,360
It's okay, I'm locked in now.

4502
04:06:51,590 --> 04:06:53,890
I don't have a fuse, sir.

4503
04:06:54,870 --> 04:06:56,050
He's asleep, Hulk's asleep.

4504
04:06:56,850 --> 04:06:57,370
I'm ulting this.

4505
04:07:04,730 --> 04:07:05,610
Oh no.

4506
04:07:06,910 --> 04:07:07,570
Wait, a stranger just won!

4507
04:07:07,650 --> 04:07:08,070
A stranger just won!

4508
04:07:08,450 --> 04:07:10,110
I got you.

4509
04:07:14,250 --> 04:07:15,830
Oh no, I don't got you.

4510
04:07:20,810 --> 04:07:21,430
Oh no.

4511
04:07:23,430 --> 04:07:24,290
I slept him.

4512
04:07:29,030 --> 04:07:29,430
Whoa!

4513
04:07:32,210 --> 04:07:33,130
I got you.

4514
04:07:34,930 --> 04:07:35,670
Iron Man's low.

4515
04:07:38,670 --> 04:07:39,930
Oh my god!

4516
04:07:41,750 --> 04:07:43,370
Okay, did we make the prediction?

4517
04:07:44,190 --> 04:07:44,590
I don't know.

4518
04:07:44,830 --> 04:07:45,350
Is my mod?

4519
04:07:45,450 --> 04:07:46,210
Okay, we did not.

4520
04:07:46,310 --> 04:07:47,070
Alright, I'll make a prediction.

4521
04:07:48,090 --> 04:07:49,550
Alright, how do I do this again?

4522
04:07:49,790 --> 04:07:51,290
Oh my god, I have to actually do my own...

4523
04:07:51,290 --> 04:07:53,670
I have to run my own channel?

4524
04:07:54,270 --> 04:07:58,730
I have to...

4525
04:07:58,890 --> 04:08:01,310
I have to run my own channel?

4526
04:08:06,950 --> 04:08:13,010
How long do you think we have until Stacks taps out?

4527
04:08:14,230 --> 04:08:17,610
Okay, do you think the Stacks will survive?

4528
04:08:19,170 --> 04:08:20,750
They will tap out?

4529
04:08:21,550 --> 04:08:23,290
They are in it...

4530
04:08:24,710 --> 04:08:27,250
They are in it until top 500?

4531
04:08:30,970 --> 04:08:33,730
Alright, I'll make the pull 5 minutes.

4532
04:08:39,050 --> 04:08:40,850
Alright, here we go.

4533
04:08:41,350 --> 04:08:43,210
Oh my god, it's like I'm a streamer, guys.

4534
04:08:46,310 --> 04:08:48,150
Oh my god.

4535
04:08:50,210 --> 04:08:53,010
Oh, I'm like...

4536
04:08:53,010 --> 04:08:55,310
I slept the Hulk behind us.

4537
04:09:07,890 --> 04:09:09,450
Damage boost!

4538
04:09:10,990 --> 04:09:12,630
You're so low!

4539
04:09:15,210 --> 04:09:17,010
Oh my god!

4540
04:09:18,470 --> 04:09:21,150
I'm trying my best to keep you up!

4541
04:09:22,330 --> 04:09:23,450
Oh my god!

4542
04:09:25,070 --> 04:09:26,870
Oh my god!

4543
04:09:28,730 --> 04:09:32,050
This is a little bit scary.

4544
04:09:36,270 --> 04:09:38,030
We're all...

4545
04:09:38,030 --> 04:09:43,230
All in on tap out.

4546
04:09:48,410 --> 04:09:51,650
Damn, people lying on the internet like that?

4547
04:09:57,050 --> 04:09:58,090
Oh my god.

4548
04:10:01,260 --> 04:10:02,680
Am I taking this?

4549
04:10:05,880 --> 04:10:07,480
Oh my god.

4550
04:10:12,780 --> 04:10:14,360
Oh my god.

4551
04:10:15,320 --> 04:10:16,100
That's fine.

4552
04:10:18,560 --> 04:10:19,900
Oh my god.

4553
04:10:19,920 --> 04:10:20,760
He's mad, he's mad!

4554
04:10:20,840 --> 04:10:21,600
Let's go, let's go!

4555
04:10:21,620 --> 04:10:22,160
He's mad!

4556
04:10:23,480 --> 04:10:24,660
He's so mad!

4557
04:10:27,580 --> 04:10:28,540
There we go.

4558
04:10:32,550 --> 04:10:34,290
Oh my god, he's so mad.

4559
04:10:37,430 --> 04:10:38,770
He's so mad!

4560
04:10:42,310 --> 04:10:43,610
Jesus Christ.

4561
04:10:44,630 --> 04:10:45,490
Is he still mad?

4562
04:10:45,830 --> 04:10:47,850
I'm trying to keep you up!

4563
04:10:49,190 --> 04:10:49,750
Will!

4564
04:10:56,520 --> 04:10:57,540
There we go.

4565
04:10:58,260 --> 04:10:59,080
Wait, Hulk.

4566
04:11:02,160 --> 04:11:03,180
Alright, there we go.

4567
04:11:04,440 --> 04:11:05,240
There we go.

4568
04:11:06,080 --> 04:11:06,720
Believe!

4569
04:11:08,180 --> 04:11:11,760
Would be funny if they just disband right after this game.

4570
04:11:16,460 --> 04:11:18,520
That would be pretty silly.

4571
04:11:24,020 --> 04:11:25,100
Oh my god.

4572
04:11:26,400 --> 04:11:27,700
Where's our fucking Iron Man?

4573
04:11:27,760 --> 04:11:29,220
I always have to keep track of him.

4574
04:11:37,200 --> 04:11:39,340
That would be pretty silly.

4575
04:11:42,060 --> 04:11:43,280
I'm locked in though.

4576
04:11:43,360 --> 04:11:45,120
I'm trying my fucking best.

4577
04:11:45,720 --> 04:11:48,420
It's just he he ha ha's jokes, you know?

4578
04:11:57,070 --> 04:11:58,670
No you don't!

4579
04:12:00,810 --> 04:12:01,890
Oh yes you do!

4580
04:12:02,170 --> 04:12:02,750
Yes you do!

4581
04:12:02,990 --> 04:12:03,810
Yes you do!

4582
04:12:07,310 --> 04:12:08,770
Yes you do!

4583
04:12:14,720 --> 04:12:15,860
Oh my god!

4584
04:12:20,040 --> 04:12:20,720
No!

4585
04:12:21,660 --> 04:12:23,180
Don't be angry!

4586
04:12:27,560 --> 04:12:30,380
Oh my god, I'm trying to look at him.

4587
04:12:36,550 --> 04:12:37,650
Damage boost!

4588
04:12:44,640 --> 04:12:45,540
That's right!

4589
04:12:45,700 --> 04:12:46,460
Now he's angry!

4590
04:12:53,210 --> 04:12:53,970
Yeah!

4591
04:12:57,150 --> 04:12:58,370
I'm so happy.

4592
04:13:03,970 --> 04:13:05,230
Oh my god.

4593
04:13:06,730 --> 04:13:07,790
Oh he's one!

4594
04:13:07,930 --> 04:13:08,670
Oh my god!

4595
04:13:10,890 --> 04:13:12,430
Oh no, he's smashing!

4596
04:13:15,990 --> 04:13:17,590
You're so alive!

4597
04:13:17,830 --> 04:13:18,250
Woman!

4598
04:13:19,050 --> 04:13:20,850
But women aren't real, so she's not alive.

4599
04:13:25,910 --> 04:13:26,890
Let's go.

4600
04:13:29,830 --> 04:13:31,310
We did it!

4601
04:13:31,430 --> 04:13:32,610
Oh my god, another win.

4602
04:13:33,010 --> 04:13:34,850
We definitely lost at the next game.

4603
04:13:34,930 --> 04:13:35,270
Oh my god!

4604
04:13:38,410 --> 04:13:42,210
I think my stack is going crazy.

4605
04:13:42,790 --> 04:13:45,470
I think they're going crazy.

4606
04:13:45,990 --> 04:13:51,110
They're like, win, loss, win, loss, win, loss.

4607
04:13:52,850 --> 04:13:57,570
You see, this is my life, so I'm like not, like, I'm like used to it now.

4608
04:13:57,630 --> 04:13:58,970
I don't think they're used to it.

4609
04:13:59,090 --> 04:14:02,570
They're like high ELO pro players, so they're used to having win streak.

4610
04:14:02,850 --> 04:14:06,590
But now they know what it's like to play in my fucking lobby.

4611
04:14:11,710 --> 04:14:15,090
They know what it's like in my ELO hell.

4612
04:14:16,870 --> 04:14:17,830
So much.

4613
04:14:17,990 --> 04:14:18,990
They're in my world.

4614
04:14:18,990 --> 04:14:19,750
Hey guys.

4615
04:14:19,830 --> 04:14:21,470
Okay, I think they all have...

4616
04:14:21,470 --> 04:14:21,910
Wait, let's see.

4617
04:14:22,590 --> 04:14:24,050
You can tell when they started playing with me.

4618
04:14:24,150 --> 04:14:24,610
Okay, wait.

4619
04:14:25,370 --> 04:14:26,290
Let's see if they're...

4620
04:14:27,230 --> 04:14:28,670
Apparently, they keep their...

4621
04:14:28,670 --> 04:14:29,450
Okay, you can see.

4622
04:14:29,710 --> 04:14:31,450
Guys, when do you think they started playing with...

4623
04:14:31,450 --> 04:14:32,470
Okay, not this part.

4624
04:14:32,850 --> 04:14:33,250
There's...

4625
04:14:33,250 --> 04:14:33,470
Okay.

4626
04:14:39,850 --> 04:14:40,970
What do you think, guys?

4627
04:14:41,130 --> 04:14:43,890
When do you think they started playing with me?

4628
04:14:49,650 --> 04:14:51,050
I see...

4629
04:14:51,050 --> 04:14:52,890
I see confetti.

4630
04:14:54,750 --> 04:14:55,470
Hey guys.

4631
04:14:55,790 --> 04:14:58,110
This is when they were playing by themselves.

4632
04:14:58,470 --> 04:14:59,550
Playing with each other.

4633
04:15:00,310 --> 04:15:02,930
And this is when they started playing.

4634
04:15:05,850 --> 04:15:09,770
You know how like in Valorant, people are aiming for the green carpet?

4635
04:15:10,510 --> 04:15:12,310
This is called the gray carpet.

4636
04:15:12,670 --> 04:15:14,230
The striped carpet.

4637
04:15:18,990 --> 04:15:20,030
The gray...

4638
04:15:20,030 --> 04:15:21,770
No, it's not even fully gray.

4639
04:15:22,150 --> 04:15:23,750
It's like striped.

4640
04:15:25,270 --> 04:15:28,390
Correlation does not equal causation.

4641
04:15:30,570 --> 04:15:32,730
The beige carpet.

4642
04:15:33,230 --> 04:15:34,750
It's like the zebra print.

4643
04:15:35,290 --> 04:15:37,510
It's the fucking zebra print.

4644
04:15:39,910 --> 04:15:41,290
This is it.

4645
04:15:42,570 --> 04:15:44,630
There's some yellow in there.

4646
04:15:45,190 --> 04:15:46,790
There's some yellow.

4647
04:15:48,990 --> 04:15:49,570
It's fine.

4648
04:15:49,750 --> 04:15:52,190
There's like a couple of yellow in there.

4649
04:15:52,330 --> 04:15:53,110
The tiger stripes.

4650
04:15:53,230 --> 04:15:53,770
It's kinda ugly.

4651
04:15:53,930 --> 04:15:54,970
It's like my tiger print.

4652
04:15:55,830 --> 04:15:58,250
But like the tiger has like...

4653
04:15:58,940 --> 04:15:59,810
It's albino.

4654
04:16:01,890 --> 04:16:03,830
It's like my albino tiger.

4655
04:16:04,830 --> 04:16:06,250
That's basically it.

4656
04:16:14,690 --> 04:16:15,670
It's fine.

4657
04:16:17,170 --> 04:16:17,810
Quit the game.

4658
04:16:18,050 --> 04:16:20,610
You're gonna make them quit the game.

4659
04:16:20,970 --> 04:16:23,010
I'm gonna make them all retire.

4660
04:16:25,930 --> 04:16:27,130
Yo, what's up, mace?

4661
04:16:27,890 --> 04:16:29,710
Play with Dookie is like...

4662
04:16:29,710 --> 04:16:31,130
It's like an assignment.

4663
04:16:31,550 --> 04:16:33,270
What's that supposed to mean?

4664
04:16:33,570 --> 04:16:36,170
Is that supposed to be positive?

4665
04:16:37,150 --> 04:16:38,330
What did you do?

4666
04:16:40,210 --> 04:16:41,650
I can't tell.

4667
04:16:45,990 --> 04:16:47,170
I can't tell.

4668
04:16:54,340 --> 04:16:56,700
It can be positive if you want it to be.

4669
04:16:56,700 --> 04:16:58,700
Who on their team is...

4670
04:16:59,840 --> 04:17:00,440
Spank.

4671
04:17:04,300 --> 04:17:04,760
Sorry.

4672
04:17:06,660 --> 04:17:09,360
I'm sorry, Fullmetal Ants.

4673
04:17:09,460 --> 04:17:10,480
I'm sorry.

4674
04:17:14,220 --> 04:17:15,560
I think he's like...

4675
04:17:15,560 --> 04:17:17,260
Who's on this team that's streaming?

4676
04:17:26,240 --> 04:17:28,220
I saw the ban, Strange.

4677
04:17:28,440 --> 04:17:29,060
I did it.

4678
04:17:29,520 --> 04:17:30,920
And then two other people did not vote.

4679
04:17:30,920 --> 04:17:32,900
Including your fucking duo, man.

4680
04:17:35,600 --> 04:17:37,520
I'm not banning anymore.

4681
04:17:37,660 --> 04:17:39,880
I'm not banning anymore.

4682
04:17:42,100 --> 04:17:46,020
I think you need to start blocking your team.

4683
04:17:51,260 --> 04:17:52,860
Where are these bans?

4684
04:17:53,220 --> 04:17:58,040
It's called going to the Marvel Rivals category and seeing the front page.

4685
04:17:58,040 --> 04:18:01,120
That's what my bans are.

4686
04:18:07,280 --> 04:18:08,520
Wait, Adam...

4687
04:18:08,520 --> 04:18:09,960
Wait, he can finally play Adam!

4688
04:18:10,480 --> 04:18:11,840
We did it, guys!

4689
04:18:11,980 --> 04:18:13,940
After six games!

4690
04:18:18,620 --> 04:18:20,400
Oh my god.

4691
04:18:20,600 --> 04:18:22,060
We finally did it!

4692
04:18:22,060 --> 04:18:23,060
There he is.

4693
04:18:25,460 --> 04:18:28,000
Who's target banning my Penny?

4694
04:18:31,720 --> 04:18:32,900
Oh, I have a C!

4695
04:18:34,810 --> 04:18:35,760
Not anymore.

4696
04:18:36,940 --> 04:18:38,140
That's my ban.

4697
04:18:38,200 --> 04:18:39,080
I didn't realize.

4698
04:18:39,680 --> 04:18:41,380
It starts in five seconds.

4699
04:18:44,040 --> 04:18:45,800
I got a little too excited.

4700
04:18:46,500 --> 04:18:47,420
Guys, just...

4701
04:18:47,420 --> 04:18:47,940
Oh no.

4702
04:18:48,260 --> 04:18:49,220
No, they have Hawkeye.

4703
04:18:50,040 --> 04:18:50,700
No.

4704
04:18:53,140 --> 04:18:54,360
Oh no.

4705
04:18:59,080 --> 04:19:00,860
I really wish you banned Hela.

4706
04:19:07,490 --> 04:19:10,110
We wish a lot of things, guys.

4707
04:19:15,310 --> 04:19:16,010
We just will.

4708
04:19:18,710 --> 04:19:19,390
Alright.

4709
04:19:20,390 --> 04:19:21,170
Don't worry.

4710
04:19:22,730 --> 04:19:23,790
I froze him.

4711
04:19:27,560 --> 04:19:28,760
Oh my god.

4712
04:19:30,300 --> 04:19:32,180
How did we lose both?

4713
04:19:34,700 --> 04:19:35,540
Oh.

4714
04:19:36,040 --> 04:19:39,280
Wait, we did ban Hela or Hawkeye?

4715
04:19:39,820 --> 04:19:40,940
What happened?

4716
04:19:42,560 --> 04:19:45,480
How did we let Hela and Hawkeye through?

4717
04:19:46,660 --> 04:19:47,920
What kind of lobby?

4718
04:19:49,160 --> 04:19:51,880
How did we let them both through?

4719
04:19:52,540 --> 04:19:52,920
What?

4720
04:19:54,900 --> 04:19:57,400
That's crazy that happened.

4721
04:19:57,400 --> 04:20:02,300
That's actually crazy that we let both of them happen.

4722
04:20:03,100 --> 04:20:05,940
This is like the dream lobby right there.

4723
04:20:10,020 --> 04:20:11,660
It's literally the dream.

4724
04:20:23,640 --> 04:20:25,800
Wait, what?

4725
04:20:27,000 --> 04:20:27,320
What?

4726
04:20:29,100 --> 04:20:30,500
What happened?

4727
04:20:30,980 --> 04:20:31,460
What?

4728
04:20:32,100 --> 04:20:35,980
What happened?

4729
04:20:37,360 --> 04:20:38,420
Wait, I have a...

4730
04:20:38,420 --> 04:20:39,020
I have a...

4731
04:20:39,020 --> 04:20:39,440
What?

4732
04:20:43,000 --> 04:20:43,840
Wait.

4733
04:20:44,260 --> 04:20:45,140
What happened?

4734
04:20:49,380 --> 04:20:53,440
Did I specifically get DDoSed?

4735
04:20:53,880 --> 04:20:54,320
Like,

4736
04:20:57,860 --> 04:20:58,760
what was that?

4737
04:21:01,020 --> 04:21:03,020
That was crazy.

4738
04:21:03,020 --> 04:21:03,140
That was crazy.

4739
04:21:06,100 --> 04:21:08,040
Like, I literally don't know what that was.

4740
04:21:12,540 --> 04:21:13,100
Fear,

4741
04:21:18,720 --> 04:21:20,920
fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear.

4742
04:21:24,120 --> 04:21:25,480
Let me freaking go.

4743
04:21:27,420 --> 04:21:28,780
Here we go!

4744
04:21:29,940 --> 04:21:31,180
Here we go!

4745
04:21:34,540 --> 04:21:36,700
That was the one ping.

4746
04:21:36,860 --> 04:21:38,460
Like, what was that?

4747
04:21:41,720 --> 04:21:43,500
Oh my god.

4748
04:21:44,060 --> 04:21:45,260
That's crazy.

4749
04:21:45,820 --> 04:21:49,140
I'm like so confused as to what happened there.

4750
04:21:49,380 --> 04:21:50,900
I don't know what happened.

4751
04:21:51,720 --> 04:21:54,600
I'm still like...

4752
04:21:56,680 --> 04:21:58,860
We won that fight!

4753
04:21:59,320 --> 04:22:01,800
Like, how did we win that fight?

4754
04:22:03,480 --> 04:22:05,320
Okay, I'm freaking locking in.

4755
04:22:05,400 --> 04:22:06,640
That was actually crazy.

4756
04:22:07,040 --> 04:22:08,760
That was so freaking crazy.

4757
04:22:08,900 --> 04:22:11,020
I did not know how that happened.

4758
04:22:12,740 --> 04:22:15,320
No, like the lag there.

4759
04:22:15,560 --> 04:22:17,900
Did my stream lag or was it just the server?

4760
04:22:21,040 --> 04:22:21,540
Like...

4761
04:22:22,160 --> 04:22:23,900
It was just me, yeah.

4762
04:22:24,680 --> 04:22:25,720
That was so weird.

4763
04:22:32,950 --> 04:22:34,050
I was like...

4764
04:22:36,550 --> 04:22:37,430
Bubble beam.

4765
04:22:40,720 --> 04:22:41,820
I have a Venom on me.

4766
04:22:42,160 --> 04:22:43,380
I didn't freeze him.

4767
04:22:45,560 --> 04:22:46,920
He's looking for me!

4768
04:22:49,640 --> 04:22:51,440
Oh my god!

4769
04:22:57,970 --> 04:22:59,610
Oh my god!

4770
04:23:01,290 --> 04:23:02,990
I forgot I have C.

4771
04:23:03,050 --> 04:23:04,310
I forgot I have C again.

4772
04:23:04,550 --> 04:23:05,570
That's my bad.

4773
04:23:05,990 --> 04:23:08,070
I keep forgetting I have E.

4774
04:23:15,310 --> 04:23:16,150
There's no one on the left.

4775
04:23:16,750 --> 04:23:17,430
It's the last.

4776
04:23:18,490 --> 04:23:19,290
I keep forgetting.

4777
04:23:19,490 --> 04:23:20,410
I'm pushing the cart.

4778
04:23:20,550 --> 04:23:20,790
Let's go.

4779
04:23:20,870 --> 04:23:21,710
Push it, push it, push it, push it.

4780
04:23:26,610 --> 04:23:28,350
Oh my god, no way.

4781
04:23:30,070 --> 04:23:33,350
Oh my god, Kuroba playing Adam is like a whole different player.

4782
04:23:33,770 --> 04:23:35,150
It's actually crazy.

4783
04:23:41,820 --> 04:23:42,700
It's crazy!

4784
04:23:44,180 --> 04:23:45,220
When you can...

4785
04:23:45,220 --> 04:23:46,020
When they can play...

4786
04:23:46,520 --> 04:23:46,820
Here.

4787
04:23:47,140 --> 04:23:47,320
Here.

4788
04:23:47,320 --> 04:23:47,520
Here.

4789
04:23:47,520 --> 04:23:47,900
Here.

4790
04:23:48,100 --> 04:23:48,480
Here.

4791
04:23:49,100 --> 04:23:50,140
I'm alive!

4792
04:23:50,480 --> 04:23:51,600
I'm alive!

4793
04:23:53,600 --> 04:23:54,640
I'm alive!

4794
04:23:59,740 --> 04:24:01,360
I have a Venom on me.

4795
04:24:03,480 --> 04:24:03,720
Yes!

4796
04:24:08,220 --> 04:24:09,560
Guys, there's still a Venom.

4797
04:24:09,720 --> 04:24:10,720
What do you mean there's still a Venom?

4798
04:24:10,860 --> 04:24:11,940
There's still a Venom!

4799
04:24:12,760 --> 04:24:13,280
Venom!

4800
04:24:14,420 --> 04:24:14,940
Venom!

4801
04:24:14,940 --> 04:24:15,600
Venom!

4802
04:24:17,840 --> 04:24:18,400
Venom!

4803
04:24:19,920 --> 04:24:20,360
C!

4804
04:24:20,980 --> 04:24:21,900
Fucking C!

4805
04:24:27,280 --> 04:24:28,760
I forgot about C again.

4806
04:24:29,100 --> 04:24:31,200
Guys, I'm gonna remember C this time.

4807
04:24:31,960 --> 04:24:33,840
Guys, I'm gonna remember C this time.

4808
04:24:34,740 --> 04:24:35,260
This time.

4809
04:24:35,700 --> 04:24:38,720
I never play with an Iron Fist, so it's like so...

4810
04:24:39,640 --> 04:24:40,820
It like fucks with me.

4811
04:24:42,940 --> 04:24:44,460
I need to remember I have C.

4812
04:24:52,380 --> 04:24:52,860
Okay.

4813
04:24:56,830 --> 04:24:57,970
Here we go.

4814
04:25:01,790 --> 04:25:02,590
No!

4815
04:25:06,070 --> 04:25:08,630
No, I tried to keep him up!

4816
04:25:09,290 --> 04:25:10,630
I pressed C though!

4817
04:25:11,610 --> 04:25:13,130
I pressed it!

4818
04:25:13,890 --> 04:25:15,710
I actually did it!

4819
04:25:20,270 --> 04:25:21,890
I did it, guys.

4820
04:25:22,010 --> 04:25:22,910
I pressed C.

4821
04:25:24,610 --> 04:25:24,790
No.

4822
04:25:25,470 --> 04:25:27,790
Like the moon, I shine in darkness.

4823
04:25:28,090 --> 04:25:30,230
The bright heroes could make all the difference.

4824
04:25:30,590 --> 04:25:30,950
Listen.

4825
04:25:31,490 --> 04:25:33,790
I mean, can you really blame me?

4826
04:25:34,230 --> 04:25:34,450
Yes.

4827
04:25:35,530 --> 04:25:35,790
Yes.

4828
04:25:36,350 --> 04:25:39,230
This game is entirely your fault.

4829
04:25:39,630 --> 04:25:41,090
This game is entirely your fault.

4830
04:25:46,290 --> 04:25:49,290
You cannot blame the 25% chance on me.

4831
04:25:49,990 --> 04:25:51,070
This game is entirely your fault.

4832
04:25:52,390 --> 04:25:53,970
What makes you think that's true?

4833
04:25:54,130 --> 04:25:55,510
You've been playing this game for how long?

4834
04:25:55,650 --> 04:25:56,350
I want to ask you.

4835
04:25:56,410 --> 04:25:57,390
I actually need to know.

4836
04:25:57,870 --> 04:25:58,410
What about it?

4837
04:25:58,870 --> 04:25:59,310
What about it?

4838
04:25:59,630 --> 04:26:02,810
How do you find Strange a bad character to go against?

4839
04:26:03,450 --> 04:26:06,590
It's possibly like the most common thing you ever go against and you don't like it.

4840
04:26:07,330 --> 04:26:07,770
Yeah.

4841
04:26:10,590 --> 04:26:12,530
It's all falling apart.

4842
04:26:14,290 --> 04:26:17,130
It's all falling apart.

4843
04:26:17,890 --> 04:26:19,610
Thank you for the raid.

4844
04:26:19,610 --> 04:26:20,810
Thank you.

4845
04:26:20,930 --> 04:26:23,170
You can blame that on me all you want.

4846
04:26:23,290 --> 04:26:23,710
That's fine.

4847
04:26:24,190 --> 04:26:25,370
But we still have two people that vote.

4848
04:26:33,010 --> 04:26:35,030
The girls are fighting.

4849
04:26:35,470 --> 04:26:37,930
Guys, the girls are fighting.

4850
04:26:38,910 --> 04:26:40,370
What do I do?

4851
04:26:45,410 --> 04:26:47,370
I'm about to get mad.

4852
04:26:50,750 --> 04:26:52,730
Please stop fighting.

4853
04:26:53,190 --> 04:26:58,510
I don't want to watch my family get into force in front of me.

4854
04:27:01,690 --> 04:27:03,650
Wait, I have venom on me.

4855
04:27:03,910 --> 04:27:04,190
Frozen.

4856
04:27:10,990 --> 04:27:11,710
Please,

4857
04:27:18,820 --> 04:27:19,780
I'm sorry.

4858
04:27:20,580 --> 04:27:22,140
I'm so sorry.

4859
04:27:23,120 --> 04:27:25,620
Don't get into force, mom.

4860
04:27:25,820 --> 04:27:26,440
Dad.

4861
04:27:28,240 --> 04:27:29,160
Don't.

4862
04:27:29,500 --> 04:27:30,460
Please.

4863
04:27:33,760 --> 04:27:37,260
Please don't get into force.

4864
04:27:43,550 --> 04:27:44,610
He's rude.

4865
04:27:47,710 --> 04:27:48,450
He's rude.

4866
04:27:51,830 --> 04:27:54,630
He's rude.

4867
04:27:55,530 --> 04:27:56,470
He lied.

4868
04:28:01,050 --> 04:28:03,030
He lied about the bubble.

4869
04:28:10,710 --> 04:28:11,610
Oh no.

4870
04:28:12,690 --> 04:28:14,150
Are they gonna be okay?

4871
04:28:15,430 --> 04:28:16,690
Are they gonna be okay?

4872
04:28:17,590 --> 04:28:18,670
Yeah, they are.

4873
04:28:21,090 --> 04:28:22,590
What are we gonna do with it?

4874
04:28:28,980 --> 04:28:29,940
I'm sorry.

4875
04:28:30,080 --> 04:28:31,120
I can't help you.

4876
04:28:36,100 --> 04:28:36,700
Thank God.

4877
04:28:36,820 --> 04:28:37,060
Thank you.

4878
04:28:37,140 --> 04:28:37,620
I got the...

4879
04:28:46,450 --> 04:28:47,550
It's so easy.

4880
04:28:47,690 --> 04:28:48,850
If you just stop dying.

4881
04:28:54,150 --> 04:28:55,530
I can't touch my ball.

4882
04:28:56,290 --> 04:28:57,890
We can touch.

4883
04:28:58,130 --> 04:28:59,630
Yeah, we touch.

4884
04:29:03,630 --> 04:29:04,550
Stop.

4885
04:29:06,590 --> 04:29:07,510
Dad.

4886
04:29:07,970 --> 04:29:09,370
Stop fighting.

4887
04:29:09,830 --> 04:29:10,790
I know I'm overreacting.

4888
04:29:13,090 --> 04:29:14,790
Never miss.

4889
04:29:15,510 --> 04:29:17,350
Please stop fighting.

4890
04:29:17,690 --> 04:29:18,650
Mom's dead.

4891
04:29:24,200 --> 04:29:24,660
I'll come back.

4892
04:29:24,900 --> 04:29:25,860
Just chill.

4893
04:29:26,440 --> 04:29:30,740
Please don't kill me.

4894
04:29:31,040 --> 04:29:31,680
Where's the venom?

4895
04:29:32,960 --> 04:29:34,240
Venom one.

4896
04:29:37,640 --> 04:29:40,220
I'm gonna be a child of the force.

4897
04:29:40,820 --> 04:29:44,580
I'm gonna be a child of the force.

4898
04:29:46,300 --> 04:29:48,440
Live on stream.

4899
04:29:50,920 --> 04:29:52,760
He died again.

4900
04:29:54,240 --> 04:29:55,880
They're gonna kick our little...

4901
04:29:55,880 --> 04:29:58,120
My big older brother out of the house.

4902
04:29:58,180 --> 04:29:59,040
Cause he's not pink.

4903
04:29:59,100 --> 04:30:01,640
He turned 18 and they're not paying rent anymore.

4904
04:30:01,900 --> 04:30:04,880
And then mom and dad are gonna blame it on each other.

4905
04:30:05,020 --> 04:30:06,800
Saying you're the one that coddled him.

4906
04:30:06,900 --> 04:30:08,620
And that's why he's a deadbeat.

4907
04:30:09,160 --> 04:30:09,580
And then...

4908
04:30:10,120 --> 04:30:14,260
And then I have to pick who to live with.

4909
04:30:14,580 --> 04:30:15,560
But I don't.

4910
04:30:16,320 --> 04:30:17,880
But I'm gonna get two Christmases.

4911
04:30:22,020 --> 04:30:23,220
Two Christmases.

4912
04:30:27,580 --> 04:30:28,780
Two Christmases.

4913
04:30:29,280 --> 04:30:29,800
I'm ulting for you.

4914
04:30:37,900 --> 04:30:40,300
No more ult in three seconds.

4915
04:30:40,580 --> 04:30:41,500
This is the last fight.

4916
04:30:44,580 --> 04:30:46,700
I trade, I trade, I trade.

4917
04:30:47,540 --> 04:30:49,200
Two Christmases, let's go!

4918
04:30:51,740 --> 04:30:52,500
Venom's on cart.

4919
04:30:52,640 --> 04:30:53,380
Venom, no passive.

4920
04:30:57,000 --> 04:31:03,480
I fucking hate you two.

4921
04:31:03,740 --> 04:31:04,400
I hate you both.

4922
04:31:04,620 --> 04:31:05,100
I hate you both.

4923
04:31:05,320 --> 04:31:06,880
I hate both of you.

4924
04:31:15,100 --> 04:31:15,800
No!

4925
04:31:19,980 --> 04:31:21,820
What is happening?

4926
04:31:24,100 --> 04:31:25,780
Two Christmases!

4927
04:31:26,300 --> 04:31:26,960
Yippee!

4928
04:31:30,580 --> 04:31:31,440
Yay!

4929
04:31:36,120 --> 04:31:39,580
We're still crashing out.

4930
04:31:41,940 --> 04:31:43,560
Pause it, let's go.

4931
04:31:46,280 --> 04:31:51,690
I think Supersteam was much more stable than whatever the fuck I was going through.

4932
04:31:52,380 --> 04:31:56,040
I think, I think, I think Supersteam...

4933
04:31:56,040 --> 04:32:01,660
There's no way Supersteam was like as destructive as my team.

4934
04:32:02,440 --> 04:32:05,120
There's no fucking way out of this.

4935
04:32:05,260 --> 04:32:06,440
I don't even know.

4936
04:32:07,000 --> 04:32:08,140
I don't...

4937
04:32:08,140 --> 04:32:10,300
I don't even know.

4938
04:32:10,980 --> 04:32:12,020
I don't know.

4939
04:32:15,840 --> 04:32:16,540
Hahaha.

4940
04:32:18,760 --> 04:32:20,000
No shot.

4941
04:32:20,120 --> 04:32:25,800
There's no way their team had to go through what I just went through in that game.

4942
04:32:26,180 --> 04:32:27,720
There's no way.

4943
04:32:29,900 --> 04:32:32,880
Super is sitting head and hands in despair.

4944
04:32:33,380 --> 04:32:34,440
I felt that.

4945
04:32:34,500 --> 04:32:36,200
That was my team in general.

4946
04:32:37,900 --> 04:32:40,380
They were like, they were this close to dropping slurs.

4947
04:32:40,660 --> 04:32:41,720
I think...

4948
04:32:41,720 --> 04:32:42,280
Hahaha.

4949
04:32:43,360 --> 04:32:45,500
My team was this close.

4950
04:32:47,040 --> 04:32:48,400
Honestly fair.

4951
04:32:49,080 --> 04:32:51,120
Bro, we didn't even have that.

4952
04:32:51,340 --> 04:32:52,720
We had Iron Fist.

4953
04:32:54,380 --> 04:32:58,480
It literally was like we didn't, we almost didn't even have Hella.

4954
04:33:00,520 --> 04:33:04,240
We almost, we almost didn't even have a Hella.

4955
04:33:06,020 --> 04:33:08,300
This is the power of toxicity.

4956
04:33:11,560 --> 04:33:12,160
Yay.

4957
04:33:15,180 --> 04:33:15,780
Yay.

4958
04:33:16,040 --> 04:33:17,120
Oh, he's taking it out.

4959
04:33:17,340 --> 04:33:17,700
Hahaha.

4960
04:33:32,450 --> 04:33:33,050
Okay.

4961
04:33:33,850 --> 04:33:34,450
Okay.

4962
04:33:34,710 --> 04:33:36,570
I did not expect that.

4963
04:33:36,690 --> 04:33:37,210
Valid.

4964
04:33:37,690 --> 04:33:38,290
Valid.

4965
04:33:38,730 --> 04:33:39,270
Valid.

4966
04:33:39,290 --> 04:33:39,850
That's valid.

4967
04:33:40,110 --> 04:33:40,790
Not gonna lie.

4968
04:33:40,930 --> 04:33:42,550
That was, that was valid.

4969
04:33:43,270 --> 04:33:45,750
I fucking can't.

4970
04:33:46,570 --> 04:33:49,070
The way he looked at me.

4971
04:33:49,810 --> 04:33:50,890
That was...

4972
04:33:50,890 --> 04:33:53,970
You weren't supposed to see that.

4973
04:33:55,010 --> 04:33:55,770
He's...

4974
04:33:55,770 --> 04:33:56,830
Oh my god.

4975
04:33:57,350 --> 04:33:58,430
Oh my god.

4976
04:34:01,210 --> 04:34:02,350
That dude's crazy.

4977
04:34:03,270 --> 04:34:04,610
He's on the list.

4978
04:34:04,770 --> 04:34:07,230
That Iron Fist is definitely on the list now.

4979
04:34:07,430 --> 04:34:08,530
There's no way.

4980
04:34:10,270 --> 04:34:12,190
He looked at me.

4981
04:34:12,190 --> 04:34:13,790
He was like, this isn't what it looks like.

4982
04:34:14,030 --> 04:34:15,070
I swear.

4983
04:34:17,030 --> 04:34:19,890
The secret is safe with us, right guys?

4984
04:34:20,890 --> 04:34:23,010
The secret is safe with us.

4985
04:34:23,750 --> 04:34:25,250
Don't tell anyone.

4986
04:34:28,650 --> 04:34:31,390
He's still going at it.

4987
04:34:31,830 --> 04:34:33,190
He has to let it out.

4988
04:34:33,810 --> 04:34:35,290
We saw nothing, guys.

4989
04:34:35,690 --> 04:34:37,490
We don't know where the body is buried.

4990
04:34:37,630 --> 04:34:38,430
We weren't there.

4991
04:34:40,070 --> 04:34:40,630
Body?

4992
04:34:40,750 --> 04:34:41,430
What body?

4993
04:34:42,990 --> 04:34:46,510
It's funny that I mention a body when he's a missing person.

4994
04:34:49,330 --> 04:34:51,110
Sorry, I meant like...

4995
04:34:51,110 --> 04:34:53,070
I have no idea where he went.

4996
04:34:53,530 --> 04:34:56,150
Last time I saw him was in this Marvel Rivals map.

4997
04:34:56,270 --> 04:34:57,930
Last time I saw him was in Shibuya.

4998
04:35:01,750 --> 04:35:04,610
Where we're having like...

4999
04:35:05,550 --> 04:35:07,190
Jeez, I won't...

5000
04:35:09,490 --> 04:35:10,450
Oh, no.

5001
04:35:11,110 --> 04:35:12,830
Oh, my God.

5002
04:35:15,010 --> 04:35:18,190
Anyway, the last time we saw Mr...

5003
04:35:18,190 --> 04:35:18,890
What's his name?

5004
04:35:18,990 --> 04:35:19,590
Who was it?

5005
04:35:21,590 --> 04:35:26,210
The last time we saw Mr. Fatback.

5006
04:35:27,630 --> 04:35:28,870
He was...

5007
04:35:28,870 --> 04:35:32,290
We were having a nice family dinner in Shibuya.

5008
04:35:32,990 --> 04:35:34,430
And like...

5009
04:35:34,430 --> 04:35:36,790
Not gonna lie, they were...

5010
04:35:36,790 --> 04:35:39,070
I think they were like bonding and stuff.

5011
04:35:40,410 --> 04:35:41,050
Whatever.

5012
04:35:44,970 --> 04:35:46,910
He's letting it all out.

5013
04:35:51,430 --> 04:35:53,250
He's letting it...

5014
04:35:53,930 --> 04:35:56,150
Yeah, but that was like...

5015
04:35:56,150 --> 04:35:58,030
That was like, you know...

5016
04:35:58,030 --> 04:36:00,430
I saw him like last week, you know?

5017
04:36:00,690 --> 04:36:01,570
It was last week.

5018
04:36:03,910 --> 04:36:06,170
Bro is venting right now.

5019
04:36:07,190 --> 04:36:09,010
They're not crashing out, guys.

5020
04:36:09,050 --> 04:36:11,110
They're not gonna tap out, chat.

5021
04:36:11,810 --> 04:36:13,670
They're not gonna tap out.

5022
04:36:13,750 --> 04:36:14,970
Everything will be fine.

5023
04:36:16,670 --> 04:36:18,150
Everything will be fine.

5024
04:36:19,030 --> 04:36:20,230
What is the percent...

5025
04:36:20,230 --> 04:36:22,770
Actually, what is the percentage of it?

5026
04:36:23,670 --> 04:36:24,710
Of the prediction?

5027
04:36:24,910 --> 04:36:25,770
How do I check?

5028
04:36:26,730 --> 04:36:28,010
How do I check my prediction?

5029
04:36:28,250 --> 04:36:29,930
Does anyone know what the percentage was?

5030
04:36:30,710 --> 04:36:31,210
Like...

5031
04:36:31,210 --> 04:36:36,030
Of like people who think they're gonna give up versus they're here for the long grind.

5032
04:36:36,790 --> 04:36:37,830
Anyone saw the percentage?

5033
04:36:39,930 --> 04:36:41,630
That is 44 to...

5034
04:36:41,630 --> 04:36:42,470
Do you real...

5035
04:36:42,470 --> 04:36:43,370
You guys...

5036
04:36:47,650 --> 04:36:49,490
Wow, you guys really believe.

5037
04:36:50,750 --> 04:36:51,730
I can't believe...

5038
04:36:51,730 --> 04:36:54,930
56% of you guys really believe.

5039
04:36:57,430 --> 04:36:58,290
That's crazy.

5040
04:36:59,410 --> 04:37:01,910
I believe but I chose to tap out.

5041
04:37:06,790 --> 04:37:08,350
It's alright, guys.

5042
04:37:08,570 --> 04:37:09,890
Guys, we broke the streak.

5043
04:37:10,210 --> 04:37:10,830
We're finally...

5044
04:37:11,750 --> 04:37:12,110
For...

5045
04:37:13,490 --> 04:37:14,210
After...

5046
04:37:14,210 --> 04:37:15,810
Four and a half hour...

5047
04:37:15,810 --> 04:37:17,830
After four hours, everyone.

5048
04:37:18,430 --> 04:37:20,490
We're finally up a game.

5049
04:37:21,170 --> 04:37:23,130
It just took four hours.

5050
04:37:26,590 --> 04:37:27,310
Look.

5051
04:37:27,850 --> 04:37:30,130
It's all about the end result.

5052
04:37:30,370 --> 04:37:31,070
Not how...

5053
04:37:31,070 --> 04:37:32,670
Not the journey, guys.

5054
04:37:33,150 --> 04:37:34,450
Not the journey.

5055
04:37:36,150 --> 04:37:37,170
Holy song.

5056
04:37:37,370 --> 04:37:37,630
See?

5057
04:37:38,210 --> 04:37:38,470
See?

5058
04:37:39,230 --> 04:37:41,870
Someone was like, I picked the wrong option.

5059
04:37:42,270 --> 04:37:43,590
I picked the wrong...

5060
04:37:45,810 --> 04:37:48,210
I picked the wrong option, guys.

5061
04:37:49,330 --> 04:37:50,290
I believe.

5062
04:37:52,090 --> 04:37:53,190
I believe.

5063
04:37:53,990 --> 04:37:54,950
It's okay.

5064
04:37:55,090 --> 04:37:56,730
We're gonna make it, everybody.

5065
04:37:57,390 --> 04:37:59,050
We're gonna make it.

5066
04:38:00,190 --> 04:38:01,770
I believe, guys.

5067
04:38:02,770 --> 04:38:08,150
We need 250 and we're at 120 something.

5068
04:38:08,850 --> 04:38:10,930
We're so close, guys.

5069
04:38:11,510 --> 04:38:12,830
So close.

5070
04:38:13,790 --> 04:38:15,170
We're almost there.

5071
04:38:16,550 --> 04:38:20,250
We need 100 something.

5072
04:38:21,230 --> 04:38:22,450
We're so close.

5073
04:38:23,050 --> 04:38:25,370
Can you teach me the ways of what?

5074
04:38:31,770 --> 04:38:32,310
God.

5075
04:38:44,130 --> 04:38:46,070
Just don't be a pro player.

5076
04:38:49,710 --> 04:38:52,450
Honestly, just don't be a pro player.

5077
04:38:52,890 --> 04:38:54,090
That's the only way.

5078
04:38:54,410 --> 04:38:55,750
Pros are never happy.

5079
04:38:56,050 --> 04:38:57,870
I'm sorry to tell you this.

5080
04:38:58,500 --> 04:39:02,750
Why do you think they all retire and go to Variety?

5081
04:39:03,430 --> 04:39:09,330
I don't think I've ever met a happy pro.

5082
04:39:09,790 --> 04:39:11,610
I'm gonna be honest.

5083
04:39:11,990 --> 04:39:13,330
I really am.

5084
04:39:17,570 --> 04:39:21,890
You only become happy if you win in a tournament.

5085
04:39:21,890 --> 04:39:27,810
I don't think a lot of pro players aren't happy playing ranked for long hours.

5086
04:39:28,070 --> 04:39:29,850
I was gonna say.

5087
04:39:30,650 --> 04:39:33,510
You're only happy at being number one.

5088
04:39:34,630 --> 04:39:36,790
Other than that, just stream.

5089
04:39:37,750 --> 04:39:40,770
I think I'd be a lot sadder if I wasn't streaming.

5090
04:39:41,030 --> 04:39:45,790
Because at least you guys can all laugh with me at how ridiculous our games were.

5091
04:39:46,290 --> 04:39:49,850
At least you guys can all laugh with me.

5092
04:39:52,770 --> 04:39:55,110
It's happiness and positivity.

5093
04:39:56,870 --> 04:39:58,330
We're in this together.

5094
04:40:01,450 --> 04:40:03,890
We're all in this together, guys.

5095
04:40:06,390 --> 04:40:08,830
I'm sorry, Gobus.

5096
04:40:09,090 --> 04:40:10,470
I'm so sorry.

5097
04:40:10,470 --> 04:40:13,230
What hero do you think you want to be today?

5098
04:40:14,550 --> 04:40:15,610
I'm Luna Snow.

5099
04:40:16,290 --> 04:40:21,130
For those who missed out, he was like, Derky, can you teach me the ways of laughing at pain?

5100
04:40:24,150 --> 04:40:26,130
I'm sorry I'm laughing at your pain.

5101
04:40:26,390 --> 04:40:27,150
I'm sorry.

5102
04:40:29,550 --> 04:40:29,810
Alright.

5103
04:40:40,840 --> 04:40:42,660
I believe in my team to ban people.

5104
04:40:53,890 --> 04:40:54,390
Alright.

5105
04:40:54,790 --> 04:40:55,070
Hello!

5106
04:40:56,330 --> 04:40:56,810
Tough.

5107
04:40:57,250 --> 04:40:57,730
Sidelock.

5108
04:40:57,930 --> 04:40:58,770
We're not gonna ban.

5109
04:40:59,530 --> 04:41:00,830
We're not gonna ban.

5110
04:41:01,010 --> 04:41:01,370
Oh, hello?

5111
04:41:01,550 --> 04:41:01,710
Okay.

5112
04:41:02,450 --> 04:41:03,310
I'm gonna contribute!

5113
04:41:04,350 --> 04:41:05,570
I did it!

5114
04:41:05,930 --> 04:41:08,470
I contribute to a ban and I'm not trolling.

5115
04:41:13,600 --> 04:41:14,080
Oh.

5116
04:41:14,080 --> 04:41:15,020
Goodbye, Adam.

5117
04:41:17,100 --> 04:41:17,800
Mo and Krill?

5118
04:41:17,960 --> 04:41:19,020
Oh yeah, there's Mo and Krill.

5119
04:41:19,680 --> 04:41:20,440
He's top 500.

5120
04:41:20,600 --> 04:41:21,600
I saw him on the leaderboard.

5121
04:41:24,540 --> 04:41:25,680
Why ban Mang?

5122
04:41:25,840 --> 04:41:26,400
I don't know.

5123
04:41:26,400 --> 04:41:27,880
Thank god.

5124
04:41:27,960 --> 04:41:28,780
Fuck me.

5125
04:41:29,100 --> 04:41:34,300
No more

5126
04:41:38,550 --> 04:41:39,270
fear.

5127
04:41:39,890 --> 04:41:40,530
That's right.

5128
04:41:41,650 --> 04:41:43,790
I'm here for the anti-immune resistance.

5129
04:41:44,910 --> 04:41:46,930
They are a menace to society.

5130
04:41:47,970 --> 04:41:49,940
They think they're better than us because...

5131
04:41:50,950 --> 04:41:53,950
Because their DNA is just a little different?

5132
04:41:56,110 --> 04:41:56,670
True.

5133
04:41:56,670 --> 04:41:56,810
True.

5134
04:41:59,280 --> 04:42:01,970
How dare they think they're better than us.

5135
04:42:04,280 --> 04:42:05,570
How dare they.

5136
04:42:06,930 --> 04:42:08,850
The DNA stops now.

5137
04:42:11,530 --> 04:42:13,110
Toki Puli.

5138
04:42:19,340 --> 04:42:22,450
Sounds like an okay striker.

5139
04:42:22,890 --> 04:42:25,980
Stop acting like a Twitch streamer.

5140
04:42:26,670 --> 04:42:27,330
What is that?

5141
04:42:29,750 --> 04:42:30,630
Alright.

5142
04:42:34,370 --> 04:42:35,890
Everything is fine.

5143
04:42:36,810 --> 04:42:39,290
Wait, am I solo heal?

5144
04:42:45,690 --> 04:42:52,270
I can solo heal this.

5145
04:42:52,470 --> 04:42:52,870
Don't worry.

5146
04:42:52,870 --> 04:42:53,030
Alright.

5147
04:42:57,340 --> 04:42:59,080
I can solo heal this.

5148
04:43:07,630 --> 04:43:11,250
Please, I'm going through it right now.

5149
04:43:25,860 --> 04:43:27,820
There's someone to our left.

5150
04:43:29,280 --> 04:43:30,140
Oh, there he is.

5151
04:43:31,100 --> 04:43:32,620
Oh, there he goes.

5152
04:43:32,920 --> 04:43:34,520
He goes again.

5153
04:43:39,060 --> 04:43:40,180
Guys, I think...

5154
04:43:48,750 --> 04:43:50,990
Guys, it's fine.

5155
04:43:58,770 --> 04:43:59,890
What's going on?

5156
04:44:01,850 --> 04:44:03,430
What's going on?

5157
04:44:05,010 --> 04:44:06,730
What's going on?

5158
04:44:08,050 --> 04:44:09,570
Oh my god.

5159
04:44:10,050 --> 04:44:11,650
What's going on?

5160
04:44:16,490 --> 04:44:18,230
Will we be fine?

5161
04:44:18,390 --> 04:44:19,850
When he never misses?

5162
04:44:20,510 --> 04:44:23,950
Oh, that's fine.

5163
04:44:24,670 --> 04:44:26,910
Will we be fine, guys?

5164
04:44:29,170 --> 04:44:30,510
Where's the Hawkeye?

5165
04:44:48,930 --> 04:44:51,050
What happened to me?

5166
04:44:52,090 --> 04:44:53,350
Wait, who's win trading?

5167
04:44:57,110 --> 04:44:58,110
Who's win trading?

5168
04:44:58,110 --> 04:44:58,390
Who's win trading?

5169
04:44:58,650 --> 04:45:02,110
Who the fuck is...

5170
04:45:02,110 --> 04:45:03,990
I have no idea who's win trading.

5171
04:45:05,390 --> 04:45:06,450
Who is it?

5172
04:45:10,410 --> 04:45:10,970
Goodbye.

5173
04:45:23,850 --> 04:45:24,770
Bye.

5174
04:45:32,330 --> 04:45:34,530
Oh my god, what's going on?

5175
04:45:35,510 --> 04:45:36,810
It's okay.

5176
04:45:37,330 --> 04:45:38,570
Things will be fine.

5177
04:45:39,630 --> 04:45:41,690
Things will be fine.

5178
04:45:44,250 --> 04:45:46,130
We're so healthy.

5179
04:45:46,850 --> 04:45:48,170
We're standing in a line.

5180
04:45:57,150 --> 04:45:59,110
We're standing in a line.

5181
04:46:01,610 --> 04:46:03,650
Oh my...

5182
04:46:03,650 --> 04:46:04,970
Oh, I missed.

5183
04:46:05,610 --> 04:46:06,530
I missed.

5184
04:46:07,610 --> 04:46:10,270
Things were not fine, guys.

5185
04:46:10,870 --> 04:46:12,850
Things were not fine.

5186
04:46:18,930 --> 04:46:20,330
What?

5187
04:46:20,330 --> 04:46:21,630
Guys, things will be fine.

5188
04:46:29,270 --> 04:46:30,030
What?

5189
04:46:31,710 --> 04:46:34,030
Alright, here I go.

5190
04:46:35,470 --> 04:46:37,230
Here we go.

5191
04:46:38,950 --> 04:46:39,910
Yippee!

5192
04:46:41,250 --> 04:46:44,310
Let's hope I don't get Hawkeye!

5193
04:46:49,120 --> 04:46:49,820
Oh.

5194
04:46:52,120 --> 04:46:52,660
That's...

5195
04:46:52,660 --> 04:46:53,040
Oh!

5196
04:46:54,660 --> 04:46:55,200
Oh!

5197
04:46:58,120 --> 04:47:00,280
I don't feel safe.

5198
04:47:04,220 --> 04:47:05,820
Remember what you said about me earlier?

5199
04:47:06,180 --> 04:47:06,640
Wolverine?

5200
04:47:06,680 --> 04:47:08,080
Why does this always happen to me?

5201
04:47:08,220 --> 04:47:09,090
Every time I...

5202
04:47:10,140 --> 04:47:12,160
Why does this not always happen to me?

5203
04:47:13,840 --> 04:47:15,140
I'm Luna Snow.

5204
04:47:15,280 --> 04:47:18,220
Like the moon, I shine in darkness.

5205
04:47:18,480 --> 04:47:20,640
The right heroes can make all the difference.

5206
04:47:21,580 --> 04:47:22,300
What is...

5207
04:47:22,300 --> 04:47:24,840
Yo, I got here.

5208
04:47:25,380 --> 04:47:27,200
I'm playing DPS.

5209
04:47:32,090 --> 04:47:33,950
What's going on?

5210
04:47:34,270 --> 04:47:35,150
What's going...

5211
04:47:35,150 --> 04:47:36,590
Who the fuck is Window?

5212
04:47:36,910 --> 04:47:37,670
Is that...

5213
04:47:38,750 --> 04:47:39,470
What?

5214
04:47:39,470 --> 04:47:39,930
What?

5215
04:47:42,810 --> 04:47:45,430
Now I'm part of some fucking drama.

5216
04:47:45,750 --> 04:47:47,010
Oh my god.

5217
04:47:47,190 --> 04:47:48,690
What's going on?

5218
04:47:49,430 --> 04:47:50,040
I'm just...

5219
04:47:50,730 --> 04:47:52,250
Oh my god.

5220
04:47:53,270 --> 04:47:55,010
What's going on?

5221
04:48:00,620 --> 04:48:02,900
Oh wait, that's the rank one.

5222
04:48:03,160 --> 04:48:03,820
Isn't that?

5223
04:48:04,580 --> 04:48:06,100
How the fuck did I get here?

5224
04:48:06,700 --> 04:48:08,200
I'm just a little guy.

5225
04:48:10,220 --> 04:48:11,600
I'm in some...

5226
04:48:11,600 --> 04:48:13,760
Smiling wave, everybody.

5227
04:48:13,980 --> 04:48:15,160
I'm just a little...

5228
04:48:15,160 --> 04:48:16,260
A small guy.

5229
04:48:20,760 --> 04:48:21,660
Don't worry, guys.

5230
04:48:21,780 --> 04:48:22,760
We'll win the next one.

5231
04:48:27,200 --> 04:48:28,200
How do I...

5232
04:48:28,200 --> 04:48:29,760
How do I counter this?

5233
04:48:30,280 --> 04:48:31,640
I thought this was a con...

5234
04:48:31,640 --> 04:48:32,760
Oh, this is...

5235
04:48:39,640 --> 04:48:41,960
I'm trying, bro.

5236
04:48:45,360 --> 04:48:47,080
I'm scared.

5237
04:48:49,900 --> 04:48:52,120
Oh my god.

5238
04:48:52,200 --> 04:48:54,220
What the fuck is going on?

5239
04:48:57,880 --> 04:49:00,080
He sounds so...

5240
04:49:00,080 --> 04:49:01,500
Don't worry, guys.

5241
04:49:01,800 --> 04:49:02,740
I'm trying.

5242
04:49:06,160 --> 04:49:08,100
I'm just a little guy.

5243
04:49:08,660 --> 04:49:10,280
How did we get here?

5244
04:49:13,540 --> 04:49:14,760
Sorry, I broke that.

5245
04:49:15,380 --> 04:49:16,220
That was my fault.

5246
04:49:21,260 --> 04:49:23,100
I broke his only platform.

5247
04:49:24,300 --> 04:49:25,220
We were locked out.

5248
04:49:30,010 --> 04:49:32,230
What's going on, guys?

5249
04:49:32,770 --> 04:49:34,510
Why can't we be friends?

5250
04:49:35,230 --> 04:49:37,090
Why can't we be friends?

5251
04:49:37,730 --> 04:49:39,710
Why can't we be friends?

5252
04:49:39,710 --> 04:49:42,310
Why can't we be friends?

5253
04:49:46,970 --> 04:49:49,610
Why can't we be friends?

5254
04:49:49,910 --> 04:49:51,490
Here we go.

5255
04:49:52,130 --> 04:49:53,410
Here we go.

5256
04:49:54,130 --> 04:49:57,210
Let's be friends together, everyone.

5257
04:49:59,130 --> 04:50:01,150
Let's be friends.

5258
04:50:05,590 --> 04:50:07,910
Oh my god!

5259
04:50:15,040 --> 04:50:15,640
What happened?

5260
04:50:23,980 --> 04:50:27,080
What the fuck?

5261
04:50:27,620 --> 04:50:28,840
What is going on?

5262
04:50:31,960 --> 04:50:36,320
We waited for the right moment.

5263
04:50:36,900 --> 04:50:38,860
Oh my god.

5264
04:50:53,930 --> 04:50:54,670
Guys.

5265
04:50:57,630 --> 04:50:58,370
Guys.

5266
04:50:59,510 --> 04:51:01,630
Things aren't looking grand.

5267
04:51:09,020 --> 04:51:10,500
I left.

5268
04:51:11,400 --> 04:51:14,880
I think I would've made it worse if I say anything.

5269
04:51:15,180 --> 04:51:17,440
I think I would've made it worse.

5270
04:51:18,540 --> 04:51:21,380
Guys, now you know why a lot of pro players are depressed.

5271
04:51:25,860 --> 04:51:27,400
Now you know.

5272
04:51:30,490 --> 04:51:32,750
Now you know.

5273
04:51:35,290 --> 04:51:38,710
What is he angry about?

5274
04:51:48,210 --> 04:51:51,830
I don't think he's okay.

5275
04:51:51,830 --> 04:51:53,510
I don't know what to do.

5276
04:51:56,530 --> 04:51:57,990
Look, he can't...

5277
04:51:57,990 --> 04:51:58,970
Guys, look.

5278
04:51:59,030 --> 04:52:01,050
This is his therapy right now.

5279
04:52:03,970 --> 04:52:06,210
I've played these games before.

5280
04:52:07,930 --> 04:52:08,470
Damn.

5281
04:52:11,030 --> 04:52:13,550
Guys, he's crashing out.

5282
04:52:14,650 --> 04:52:16,110
Guys, my team's crashing out.

5283
04:52:16,650 --> 04:52:17,090
Guys.

5284
04:52:18,050 --> 04:52:20,430
And then we'll never see them again.

5285
04:52:21,830 --> 04:52:24,350
Guys, I don't think they're gonna invite me again.

5286
04:52:24,470 --> 04:52:24,990
Guys.

5287
04:52:25,250 --> 04:52:28,770
I think this is the last time I'll ever see them again.

5288
04:52:33,590 --> 04:52:35,850
After this stream, remove.

5289
04:52:36,230 --> 04:52:36,750
List.

5290
04:52:37,210 --> 04:52:37,790
Avoid.

5291
04:52:45,650 --> 04:52:47,330
Get your therapy.

5292
04:52:53,410 --> 04:52:54,090
Again!

5293
04:52:55,570 --> 04:52:56,210
Again!

5294
04:52:58,630 --> 04:52:59,990
They're like...

5295
04:52:59,990 --> 04:53:01,250
Mace, what did you...

5296
04:53:01,250 --> 04:53:03,810
Mace, I thought you said it'll only take six games, Mace.

5297
04:53:04,350 --> 04:53:05,110
I thought...

5298
04:53:05,110 --> 04:53:06,830
I thought you said...

5299
04:53:07,490 --> 04:53:09,830
I thought you said...

5300
04:53:10,690 --> 04:53:12,030
I thought you...

5301
04:53:12,490 --> 04:53:13,830
It's so hard!

5302
04:53:18,330 --> 04:53:19,010
No!

5303
04:53:20,130 --> 04:53:21,530
They do me!

5304
04:53:21,990 --> 04:53:24,270
They're gonna tap out!

5305
04:53:25,170 --> 04:53:25,410
No!

5306
04:53:30,930 --> 04:53:34,090
He wants to go again.

5307
04:53:34,690 --> 04:53:35,590
But there's a...

5308
04:53:35,590 --> 04:53:36,770
That's a third option!

5309
04:53:37,610 --> 04:53:39,350
That's a secret third option!

5310
04:53:41,430 --> 04:53:43,090
What I mean tomorrow.

5311
04:53:43,750 --> 04:53:45,070
It continues.

5312
04:53:46,470 --> 04:53:46,950
Wait!

5313
04:53:46,950 --> 04:53:47,090
Wait!

5314
04:53:47,130 --> 04:53:49,350
I gotta fight it back!

5315
04:53:50,230 --> 04:53:52,130
Guys, it's not over yet!

5316
04:53:52,910 --> 04:53:54,990
This prediction lasts until tomorrow.

5317
04:53:55,530 --> 04:53:58,530
Guys, we're holding your points hostage until tomorrow.

5318
04:53:59,330 --> 04:54:01,650
We won't get you top five.

5319
04:54:02,030 --> 04:54:03,850
We're gonna hold your points hostage.

5320
04:54:04,330 --> 04:54:06,130
Then we'll see if they tap out.

5321
04:54:07,630 --> 04:54:09,750
They don't hate me!

5322
04:54:13,010 --> 04:54:14,670
Oh hey, there's them again.

5323
04:54:14,670 --> 04:54:17,810
They don't hate me, guys!

5324
04:54:23,870 --> 04:54:25,110
I can.

5325
04:54:25,310 --> 04:54:26,470
I'm pretty sure I can.

5326
04:54:28,030 --> 04:54:30,270
I think they just hate your Qs.

5327
04:54:31,090 --> 04:54:33,210
Guys, they don't hate me!

5328
04:54:33,270 --> 04:54:34,030
That's a win!

5329
04:54:34,030 --> 04:54:38,610
Now, who am I gonna banish from this match?

5330
04:54:40,210 --> 04:54:41,590
Keep talking, bro.

5331
04:54:41,690 --> 04:54:42,390
You're good.

5332
04:54:43,050 --> 04:54:44,390
What's going on?

5333
04:54:50,430 --> 04:54:52,810
They don't hate you as a person.

5334
04:54:53,170 --> 04:54:54,410
They just hate me in game.

5335
04:54:54,510 --> 04:54:55,410
That's different.

5336
04:54:59,200 --> 04:55:01,300
They just don't hate me in game.

5337
04:55:03,040 --> 04:55:04,580
I mean, they do hate me in game.

5338
04:55:04,580 --> 04:55:07,720
But they just hate me.

5339
04:55:07,760 --> 04:55:09,420
But they don't hate me off game.

5340
04:55:12,860 --> 04:55:14,400
Cora, thank you for the tier one sub.

5341
04:55:14,480 --> 04:55:15,340
Thank you, thank you.

5342
04:55:17,660 --> 04:55:19,980
Super happy, thank you for the tier one sub for nine months.

5343
04:55:20,100 --> 04:55:20,980
Thank you, thank you.

5344
04:55:23,380 --> 04:55:26,020
They hate the idea of Doki.

5345
04:55:30,140 --> 04:55:31,440
Alright, what are these rows?

5346
04:55:34,340 --> 04:55:37,540
Jesus, if I'm not good, what are you, bro?

5347
04:55:37,720 --> 04:55:38,380
Fourth place?

5348
04:55:38,480 --> 04:55:40,760
You're one place above!

5349
04:55:43,640 --> 04:55:46,180
Fourth place talking to the fifth place.

5350
04:55:48,240 --> 04:55:49,760
Sure, that's gonna happen.

5351
04:55:50,060 --> 04:55:52,340
Yeah, and guess who put you there?

5352
04:55:52,960 --> 04:55:53,480
Me!

5353
04:55:54,300 --> 04:55:56,620
Sure, that's gonna happen ever again, bro.

5354
04:55:56,840 --> 04:55:59,960
Like, I have zero problem with you freaks, but you're just hard win trading.

5355
04:55:59,960 --> 04:56:02,100
Nad, to get rank one back.

5356
04:56:02,960 --> 04:56:05,360
Window plays pp, it's so funny.

5357
04:56:05,780 --> 04:56:07,200
Lol, no one is win trading.

5358
04:56:07,360 --> 04:56:09,480
He throws our games, that's why.

5359
04:56:09,600 --> 04:56:11,820
Yeah, for sure, bro.

5360
04:56:12,080 --> 04:56:13,260
Oh, it does more?

5361
04:56:13,760 --> 04:56:17,420
Holy shit, how long were they typing when I scrolled up?

5362
04:56:18,320 --> 04:56:21,380
He solo'd the amount of games Window has thrown on our team.

5363
04:56:21,640 --> 04:56:23,000
Look at his profile.

5364
04:56:23,500 --> 04:56:24,940
You don't even know.

5365
04:56:25,340 --> 04:56:27,100
I'd love to, but it's private.

5366
04:56:27,100 --> 04:56:29,580
He's a troll, plays DPS.

5367
04:56:29,900 --> 04:56:30,380
Uh-huh.

5368
04:56:30,860 --> 04:56:33,410
Yeah, bro, we're private cause win trading.

5369
04:56:34,520 --> 04:56:36,260
I knew it, clip it.

5370
04:56:36,680 --> 04:56:39,100
Definitely not cause of scrims.

5371
04:56:39,460 --> 04:56:41,160
Holy shit, it's still going.

5372
04:56:41,940 --> 04:56:43,980
That's an entire novel.

5373
04:56:45,160 --> 04:56:47,580
How did it still keep going?

5374
04:56:51,760 --> 04:56:55,800
I was not expecting it to still go on.

5375
04:57:01,540 --> 04:57:03,160
I thought it ended.

5376
04:57:03,360 --> 04:57:07,300
And then I kept scrolling down.

5377
04:57:08,300 --> 04:57:11,160
I was like, it's still going?

5378
04:57:16,390 --> 04:57:18,010
Jesus Christ.

5379
04:57:20,030 --> 04:57:20,970
Oh no.

5380
04:57:21,830 --> 04:57:22,670
Oh no.

5381
04:57:24,970 --> 04:57:25,530
Oh no.

5382
04:57:26,030 --> 04:57:26,610
Catbug!

5383
04:57:26,890 --> 04:57:27,570
Catbug!

5384
04:57:28,030 --> 04:57:28,930
Catbug!

5385
04:57:30,130 --> 04:57:31,210
Cat...

5386
04:57:31,210 --> 04:57:32,230
Catbug!

5387
04:57:35,790 --> 04:57:36,430
Catbug!

5388
04:57:37,050 --> 04:57:39,690
Oh my... you know I'm not gonna waste it.

5389
04:57:39,830 --> 04:57:41,070
I'm not gonna waste it.

5390
04:57:41,150 --> 04:57:42,550
We were all fucking dead.

5391
04:57:42,630 --> 04:57:43,630
I'm not...

5392
04:57:45,130 --> 04:57:46,990
I'm not gonna waste that.

5393
04:57:47,570 --> 04:57:50,610
That was not... that was not a winnable fight.

5394
04:57:56,150 --> 04:57:57,430
No Groot.

5395
04:57:59,910 --> 04:58:02,130
He wants to be Groot.

5396
04:58:04,630 --> 04:58:06,050
I am Groot.

5397
04:58:07,570 --> 04:58:09,070
I am Groot.

5398
04:58:13,530 --> 04:58:14,990
I am Groot.

5399
04:58:16,090 --> 04:58:17,490
I am Groot.

5400
04:58:18,590 --> 04:58:19,530
I am Groot.

5401
04:58:20,830 --> 04:58:21,810
I am Groot.

5402
04:58:24,690 --> 04:58:27,470
Oh my god, he's like right behind us.

5403
04:58:30,190 --> 04:58:31,010
Oh yeah.

5404
04:58:31,910 --> 04:58:33,630
Oh my god.

5405
04:58:37,640 --> 04:58:38,700
He's ruining.

5406
04:58:39,740 --> 04:58:40,580
How's it going?

5407
04:58:43,660 --> 04:58:44,920
I'm okay.

5408
04:58:45,800 --> 04:58:47,640
But my...

5409
04:58:47,640 --> 04:58:50,120
But my stack is...

5410
04:58:50,120 --> 04:58:54,500
They're feeling my...

5411
04:58:54,500 --> 04:58:56,840
I think they might need therapy.

5412
04:58:57,080 --> 04:58:58,140
I'm not sure yet though.

5413
04:58:58,820 --> 04:59:02,400
I'm not sure yet.

5414
04:59:03,060 --> 04:59:05,340
They might need therapy.

5415
04:59:08,260 --> 04:59:10,280
I'm having the time of my life.

5416
04:59:11,920 --> 04:59:12,960
Am I frozen?

5417
04:59:15,240 --> 04:59:17,500
I'm having a great time.

5418
04:59:19,640 --> 04:59:23,220
I wanna say I made new friends, but I can't tell.

5419
04:59:28,480 --> 04:59:29,840
Oh shit.

5420
04:59:30,140 --> 04:59:34,760
I can't tell yet.

5421
04:59:35,280 --> 04:59:36,640
We can't either.

5422
04:59:37,100 --> 04:59:38,340
It's so true.

5423
04:59:39,040 --> 04:59:40,120
I can't tell.

5424
04:59:42,180 --> 04:59:45,220
Wait, there's a Hawkeye above.

5425
04:59:51,280 --> 04:59:53,160
I got him off the platform.

5426
04:59:53,340 --> 04:59:54,360
He's like to your right.

5427
04:59:54,360 --> 04:59:54,660
Wait, oh.

5428
05:00:01,120 --> 05:00:02,600
How is he still alive?

5429
05:00:02,660 --> 05:00:03,320
Okay, there you go.

5430
05:00:03,440 --> 05:00:04,100
I was gonna say.

5431
05:00:06,040 --> 05:00:06,600
Wow.

5432
05:00:11,150 --> 05:00:13,490
How the fuck was he still alive?

5433
05:00:16,710 --> 05:00:17,830
I leave.

5434
05:00:18,590 --> 05:00:19,610
I leave.

5435
05:00:20,490 --> 05:00:21,230
I leave.

5436
05:00:23,010 --> 05:00:24,490
Jarvis implode your stacks.

5437
05:00:24,630 --> 05:00:26,730
I imploded my stack by my sheer existence.

5438
05:00:26,730 --> 05:00:26,970
I imploded my stack by my sheer existence.

5439
05:00:29,530 --> 05:00:30,690
Yay!

5440
05:00:33,210 --> 05:00:35,430
Say no more.

5441
05:00:40,930 --> 05:00:46,170
I hear someone above us.

5442
05:00:54,180 --> 05:00:56,000
Can't see you.

5443
05:00:56,760 --> 05:00:57,940
I pulled in the Wolverine.

5444
05:00:59,560 --> 05:01:00,840
Come on.

5445
05:01:01,540 --> 05:01:02,900
Come on.

5446
05:01:04,780 --> 05:01:05,420
Oh.

5447
05:01:07,240 --> 05:01:08,400
Oh my god.

5448
05:01:08,640 --> 05:01:10,020
I'm just gonna die for this.

5449
05:01:10,680 --> 05:01:11,320
What?

5450
05:01:12,140 --> 05:01:13,400
Wait, we're... What?

5451
05:01:15,020 --> 05:01:16,980
Alright, we ulted after we all died.

5452
05:01:19,420 --> 05:01:20,680
Yeah, I was gonna say.

5453
05:01:20,920 --> 05:01:21,180
I was gonna say.

5454
05:01:21,260 --> 05:01:23,740
I'm just gonna... I held it because...

5455
05:01:23,740 --> 05:01:26,360
I held it because like it wasn't winnable.

5456
05:01:26,640 --> 05:01:27,720
I didn't think it was gonna be winnable.

5457
05:01:29,200 --> 05:01:32,620
I wanna say... I just wanted to like hold that.

5458
05:01:39,860 --> 05:01:41,400
Oh my god.

5459
05:01:41,460 --> 05:01:43,220
Oh my god.

5460
05:01:43,420 --> 05:01:44,660
Wait, I'm alive.

5461
05:01:48,380 --> 05:01:48,920
Bye.

5462
05:01:51,960 --> 05:01:52,700
Okay.

5463
05:01:54,920 --> 05:01:55,660
Alright.

5464
05:01:58,300 --> 05:01:59,040
Alright.

5465
05:02:00,480 --> 05:02:02,360
I was like, I'm alive?

5466
05:02:06,800 --> 05:02:07,280
What's up?

5467
05:02:07,660 --> 05:02:08,290
Frozen Wolverine.

5468
05:02:09,620 --> 05:02:10,680
No passive.

5469
05:02:10,880 --> 05:02:11,300
No passive.

5470
05:02:14,140 --> 05:02:15,540
Alright, here we go.

5471
05:02:21,390 --> 05:02:22,570
I'm looking for fall.

5472
05:02:23,810 --> 05:02:24,530
Oh.

5473
05:02:29,980 --> 05:02:30,500
Alright.

5474
05:02:31,480 --> 05:02:34,200
I have no idea where this moon is.

5475
05:02:36,940 --> 05:02:37,460
I...

5476
05:02:38,200 --> 05:02:38,460
Oh.

5477
05:02:38,860 --> 05:02:39,380
Oh.

5478
05:02:39,500 --> 05:02:39,560
Oh.

5479
05:02:39,580 --> 05:02:40,120
I'm gonna get you.

5480
05:02:40,940 --> 05:02:41,820
I got you.

5481
05:02:41,880 --> 05:02:42,480
I got you.

5482
05:02:42,880 --> 05:02:44,180
I don't got you.

5483
05:02:50,850 --> 05:02:51,930
Oh my god.

5484
05:02:52,550 --> 05:02:53,070
Sorry.

5485
05:02:53,430 --> 05:02:55,270
I didn't know I was on damage.

5486
05:02:58,250 --> 05:02:58,770
Go.

5487
05:02:58,870 --> 05:02:58,970
Go.

5488
05:02:58,990 --> 05:02:59,110
Go.

5489
05:02:59,130 --> 05:02:59,250
Go.

5490
05:03:09,300 --> 05:03:10,980
Oh my god.

5491
05:03:11,160 --> 05:03:14,950
I didn't... Okay.

5492
05:03:15,450 --> 05:03:17,870
We still... It was so intentional.

5493
05:03:18,070 --> 05:03:20,270
We won that because I was on damage.

5494
05:03:26,810 --> 05:03:32,250
Guys, if I... Guys, all I'm saying was like if I wasn't on damage, we would have lost that.

5495
05:03:32,630 --> 05:03:35,010
We got like literally two picks because of it.

5496
05:03:35,410 --> 05:03:35,770
Guys.

5497
05:03:38,370 --> 05:03:38,890
Like...

5498
05:03:39,630 --> 05:03:43,390
We literally... We got two picks because I was on damage.

5499
05:03:45,450 --> 05:03:48,670
It was... It was so intentional.

5500
05:03:49,630 --> 05:03:50,790
Hundred percent.

5501
05:03:52,850 --> 05:03:54,210
Hawkeye to the top left.

5502
05:03:58,870 --> 05:03:59,630
Protect me.

5503
05:03:59,730 --> 05:04:00,010
Protect me.

5504
05:04:00,030 --> 05:04:00,990
I'm portaling off their spawn.

5505
05:04:02,190 --> 05:04:02,710
I have to reload.

5506
05:04:03,010 --> 05:04:03,250
Oh no.

5507
05:04:03,450 --> 05:04:04,230
I portaled off their spawn.

5508
05:04:05,410 --> 05:04:06,050
Stand point.

5509
05:04:06,250 --> 05:04:06,450
Stand point.

5510
05:04:08,090 --> 05:04:09,550
I fucked up a portal on the right.

5511
05:04:11,010 --> 05:04:13,870
The root can't come out.

5512
05:04:14,110 --> 05:04:14,750
The root can't come out.

5513
05:04:14,970 --> 05:04:16,030
There's people to the left.

5514
05:04:17,350 --> 05:04:17,950
Stand point.

5515
05:04:18,070 --> 05:04:18,370
Stand point.

5516
05:04:18,570 --> 05:04:18,710
Stand point.

5517
05:04:24,470 --> 05:04:25,290
That's okay.

5518
05:04:30,180 --> 05:04:31,260
Oh my god.

5519
05:04:31,300 --> 05:04:32,160
It's okay.

5520
05:04:33,960 --> 05:04:35,540
It's not okay anymore.

5521
05:04:35,600 --> 05:04:36,060
He's frozen.

5522
05:04:40,540 --> 05:04:41,640
Oh, this is the last fight.

5523
05:04:41,740 --> 05:04:42,220
This is the last fight.

5524
05:04:46,330 --> 05:04:47,530
I'm like one HP.

5525
05:04:56,400 --> 05:04:57,280
It's working.

5526
05:04:58,760 --> 05:05:00,740
You thought we were... You thought we were losing.

5527
05:05:03,360 --> 05:05:03,800
Dude.

5528
05:05:06,540 --> 05:05:06,980
Dude.

5529
05:05:07,000 --> 05:05:07,440
Catbug.

5530
05:05:07,560 --> 05:05:07,840
Catbug.

5531
05:05:08,160 --> 05:05:08,420
Catbug.

5532
05:05:08,600 --> 05:05:12,820
Have you... Have you heard or played with any like Iron Fist players at all?

5533
05:05:13,580 --> 05:05:14,020
Yeah.

5534
05:05:15,900 --> 05:05:16,080
Why?

5535
05:05:16,080 --> 05:05:18,120
Do you want to like stop living after that?

5536
05:05:18,420 --> 05:05:18,800
At all?

5537
05:05:19,080 --> 05:05:19,300
You know.

5538
05:05:19,360 --> 05:05:19,820
Stop breathing.

5539
05:05:19,940 --> 05:05:20,540
Anything like that?

5540
05:05:20,960 --> 05:05:21,200
You know.

5541
05:05:21,260 --> 05:05:21,840
Hurting yourself.

5542
05:05:22,240 --> 05:05:22,940
Anything like that?

5543
05:05:23,020 --> 05:05:24,700
Are you talking about on my team or the other team?

5544
05:05:25,880 --> 05:05:28,360
Well, obviously, if they're on the other team, you're like happy-go-fun.

5545
05:05:28,500 --> 05:05:28,660
Right?

5546
05:05:28,740 --> 05:05:30,260
But I'm talking about when they're on your team.

5547
05:05:30,260 --> 05:05:32,400
Bro, he said he lives Iron Fist.

5548
05:05:34,200 --> 05:05:35,420
What was the other one?

5549
05:05:35,560 --> 05:05:37,800
Like Fatfuckmuck or whatever?

5550
05:05:39,000 --> 05:05:40,300
He's living red.

5551
05:05:45,640 --> 05:05:46,600
He's lost it.

5552
05:05:47,360 --> 05:05:48,320
He's lost it.

5553
05:05:48,760 --> 05:05:50,940
He's actually... He's going to do it.

5554
05:05:51,100 --> 05:05:52,200
They're kind of stupid as fuck.

5555
05:05:52,200 --> 05:05:54,260
What are they coming and doing?

5556
05:05:54,500 --> 05:05:55,340
I feel like if they...

5557
05:05:56,080 --> 05:05:59,580
My Iron Fist player picks something else and they just feed.

5558
05:06:00,900 --> 05:06:01,760
That's the problem.

5559
05:06:02,580 --> 05:06:05,380
He's like... Catbug is literally his therapist right now.

5560
05:06:06,300 --> 05:06:08,620
He's using Catbug as a therapist.

5561
05:06:09,180 --> 05:06:10,160
That's like his...

5562
05:06:11,560 --> 05:06:13,400
Fatfuckmuck or whatever his name is.

5563
05:06:13,680 --> 05:06:14,020
Fatass.

5564
05:06:14,100 --> 05:06:14,480
I don't know.

5565
05:06:14,880 --> 05:06:17,540
But he literally just kept going in over and over and over and over and over.

5566
05:06:17,880 --> 05:06:19,280
24-7.

5567
05:06:19,280 --> 05:06:20,720
What are you doing?

5568
05:06:22,160 --> 05:06:24,580
He's trauma dumping.

5569
05:06:27,380 --> 05:06:28,280
Yeah,

5570
05:06:32,900 --> 05:06:33,940
that's rough, buddy.

5571
05:06:43,380 --> 05:06:45,000
That's rough, buddy.

5572
05:06:45,340 --> 05:06:46,400
That's actually rough.

5573
05:06:47,100 --> 05:06:49,560
He's reliving the game one by one.

5574
05:06:50,340 --> 05:06:51,400
I froze him too.

5575
05:06:59,540 --> 05:07:01,020
There's a Wolverine top left.

5576
05:07:08,750 --> 05:07:09,630
Gotta do it.

5577
05:07:10,370 --> 05:07:12,190
Gotta do what you gotta do.

5578
05:07:12,330 --> 05:07:14,310
Bro needs a friend.

5579
05:07:14,710 --> 05:07:16,370
Bro, he has a friend.

5580
05:07:16,570 --> 05:07:18,650
His entire stack is his friends.

5581
05:07:18,650 --> 05:07:20,750
And I think I'm cool.

5582
05:07:21,010 --> 05:07:22,410
I'm like a plus one.

5583
05:07:25,730 --> 05:07:27,770
I need... I need heals.

5584
05:07:30,810 --> 05:07:32,090
Oh my god, I still have no ult.

5585
05:07:33,410 --> 05:07:34,390
I'm close ult.

5586
05:07:34,490 --> 05:07:34,950
I got it.

5587
05:07:36,750 --> 05:07:38,410
I got the soldier.

5588
05:07:43,510 --> 05:07:44,510
Berserker rage!

5589
05:07:44,670 --> 05:07:45,170
Let's go!

5590
05:07:45,330 --> 05:07:46,750
Fuck that guy in particular!

5591
05:07:52,870 --> 05:07:53,470
Ah!

5592
05:07:55,030 --> 05:07:56,570
What is this?

5593
05:07:56,950 --> 05:07:58,490
Don't worry about it.

5594
05:07:59,130 --> 05:07:59,930
I won't.

5595
05:08:00,030 --> 05:08:00,170
I won't.

5596
05:08:00,850 --> 05:08:01,690
What's this?

5597
05:08:07,590 --> 05:08:10,010
I'm solo queue this whole shit, bro.

5598
05:08:10,110 --> 05:08:10,890
What's he stacking?

5599
05:08:11,570 --> 05:08:13,890
Dude, he just has two top 10.

5600
05:08:15,990 --> 05:08:17,070
I got one!

5601
05:08:17,670 --> 05:08:18,270
Where?

5602
05:08:18,790 --> 05:08:20,190
I'm defending myself.

5603
05:08:21,850 --> 05:08:22,270
I'm defending myself.

5604
05:08:25,170 --> 05:08:29,390
Oh my god!

5605
05:08:29,630 --> 05:08:29,970
Oh my god!

5606
05:08:30,690 --> 05:08:34,230
That man literally was like, how did that guy got top 10?

5607
05:08:34,290 --> 05:08:34,550
Again!

5608
05:08:36,670 --> 05:08:37,270
Bro!

5609
05:08:38,410 --> 05:08:40,450
Dude, it's actually Logan.

5610
05:08:44,570 --> 05:08:46,110
Three ults, but again.

5611
05:08:46,650 --> 05:08:47,930
Where's my Wolverine?

5612
05:08:47,930 --> 05:08:50,510
Where's my Wolverine?

5613
05:08:50,510 --> 05:08:52,090
Don't worry, I got him.

5614
05:09:02,010 --> 05:09:03,010
No!

5615
05:09:07,020 --> 05:09:08,020
No!

5616
05:09:13,980 --> 05:09:15,980
Not again.

5617
05:09:16,480 --> 05:09:18,800
Not again.

5618
05:09:18,980 --> 05:09:20,400
How is he still here?

5619
05:09:20,720 --> 05:09:23,080
Holy shit, he's still here?

5620
05:09:26,260 --> 05:09:30,160
He traveled to a different country!

5621
05:09:34,480 --> 05:09:37,120
Oh my god!

5622
05:09:37,360 --> 05:09:42,120
What was that?

5623
05:09:45,180 --> 05:09:47,440
Actually, what was that?

5624
05:09:49,420 --> 05:09:50,840
That was scary.

5625
05:09:51,840 --> 05:09:53,400
That was actually scary.

5626
05:09:53,400 --> 05:09:54,600
Not gonna lie.

5627
05:09:57,480 --> 05:09:58,760
That was so scary.

5628
05:10:02,480 --> 05:10:04,100
Oh my god, do you think he's okay?

5629
05:10:04,240 --> 05:10:06,140
Guys, I don't think he's okay.

5630
05:10:06,320 --> 05:10:07,340
I don't think he's okay.

5631
05:10:07,420 --> 05:10:08,300
I think he's dead.

5632
05:10:10,300 --> 05:10:11,680
I think he died.

5633
05:10:12,380 --> 05:10:13,480
What the fuck?

5634
05:10:13,540 --> 05:10:13,980
I froze him!

5635
05:10:20,860 --> 05:10:22,080
Oh my god.

5636
05:10:30,960 --> 05:10:32,400
What happened?

5637
05:10:38,060 --> 05:10:39,500
He chocked.

5638
05:10:39,580 --> 05:10:40,300
Yeah.

5639
05:10:44,120 --> 05:10:44,840
Yeah.

5640
05:10:46,620 --> 05:10:47,340
Yeah.

5641
05:10:48,260 --> 05:10:48,980
Yeah.

5642
05:10:50,220 --> 05:10:51,880
How did he get out?

5643
05:10:52,940 --> 05:10:54,500
How did he get out?

5644
05:10:55,540 --> 05:10:57,160
How did he get out?

5645
05:10:58,820 --> 05:11:00,340
How did he get out of there?

5646
05:11:01,180 --> 05:11:04,640
I tried so many times to try to get out.

5647
05:11:10,790 --> 05:11:12,750
Oh, he's alive.

5648
05:11:15,670 --> 05:11:16,830
Wait, there's someone.

5649
05:11:16,990 --> 05:11:18,530
There's a Bucky right behind us.

5650
05:11:26,100 --> 05:11:27,620
Oh my god.

5651
05:11:30,500 --> 05:11:31,520
I'm scared.

5652
05:11:31,840 --> 05:11:32,660
I'm so scared.

5653
05:11:34,700 --> 05:11:36,000
There's someone to my right.

5654
05:11:37,000 --> 05:11:37,940
There's a Bucky.

5655
05:11:39,080 --> 05:11:40,300
Watch out, Bucky.

5656
05:11:42,560 --> 05:11:44,600
Oh my god.

5657
05:11:45,880 --> 05:11:47,320
Oh my god.

5658
05:11:48,840 --> 05:11:49,480
Oh my god.

5659
05:12:01,640 --> 05:12:03,820
I'm scared.

5660
05:12:07,660 --> 05:12:08,580
I'm gonna lose.

5661
05:12:10,280 --> 05:12:11,940
I need to reload.

5662
05:12:13,450 --> 05:12:15,000
Yeah, I'm gonna loon out now.

5663
05:12:19,820 --> 05:12:21,000
Wow.

5664
05:12:22,680 --> 05:12:23,860
Wow.

5665
05:12:25,600 --> 05:12:26,780
Wow.

5666
05:12:28,170 --> 05:12:30,220
This is... yeah.

5667
05:12:31,660 --> 05:12:32,260
Yeah.

5668
05:12:32,600 --> 05:12:33,680
Oh my god.

5669
05:12:34,360 --> 05:12:34,880
Missed.

5670
05:12:34,880 --> 05:12:35,580
No!

5671
05:12:37,660 --> 05:12:39,660
Everything is not...

5672
05:12:40,660 --> 05:12:42,460
Everything is not okay.

5673
05:12:54,160 --> 05:12:56,500
Yeah, they snowballed hard there.

5674
05:12:58,500 --> 05:13:01,100
Maybe make sure to have top.

5675
05:13:08,440 --> 05:13:10,660
I can go tank.

5676
05:13:11,260 --> 05:13:13,140
Oh my god, what is he saying to him?

5677
05:13:14,680 --> 05:13:15,760
I'm worried.

5678
05:13:15,980 --> 05:13:17,060
I can't...

5679
05:13:17,060 --> 05:13:22,940
Oh, I think he said something bad in Korean.

5680
05:13:28,540 --> 05:13:30,300
I think...

5681
05:13:31,240 --> 05:13:33,600
I think something happened.

5682
05:13:34,760 --> 05:13:35,640
Oh no.

5683
05:13:36,520 --> 05:13:38,300
Oh bro.

5684
05:13:38,900 --> 05:13:39,820
Oh no.

5685
05:13:40,280 --> 05:13:41,580
Something happened.

5686
05:13:42,340 --> 05:13:43,280
Something happened.

5687
05:13:45,560 --> 05:13:48,000
Oh, you really...

5688
05:13:48,000 --> 05:13:50,580
Oh no, he pulled out a fucking Korean.

5689
05:13:51,720 --> 05:13:54,060
Oh, my stack's crashing out.

5690
05:13:57,480 --> 05:14:00,220
It's okay guys, I'm having a good time.

5691
05:14:04,040 --> 05:14:10,640
Guys, my stack might not be having the bestest of times, but like...

5692
05:14:10,640 --> 05:14:12,720
I think... I love everything.

5693
05:14:16,860 --> 05:14:18,180
But like...

5694
05:14:18,180 --> 05:14:21,240
I'm glad... I'm glad I'm here to spend...

5695
05:14:21,240 --> 05:14:24,140
Spend my grind sessions with my chat.

5696
05:14:28,580 --> 05:14:30,200
I'm glad I get the...

5697
05:14:30,200 --> 05:14:31,980
I get to spend...

5698
05:14:31,980 --> 05:14:34,680
Spend it with you guys.

5699
05:14:35,880 --> 05:14:37,140
Oh my...

5700
05:14:39,340 --> 05:14:40,580
Oh my god.

5701
05:14:41,120 --> 05:14:41,900
That's rough.

5702
05:14:43,940 --> 05:14:47,480
I'm actually so worried about getting sniped there.

5703
05:14:47,540 --> 05:14:48,340
I got one, I got one, I got one.

5704
05:14:48,880 --> 05:14:49,540
What did he get?

5705
05:14:53,540 --> 05:14:54,220
Oh...

5706
05:14:54,220 --> 05:14:56,160
This is last fight, I think.

5707
05:15:00,820 --> 05:15:02,720
I'm a little worried here.

5708
05:15:08,140 --> 05:15:08,980
Oh no.

5709
05:15:14,610 --> 05:15:15,250
Oh wait.

5710
05:15:17,010 --> 05:15:18,890
I need... I need heals too.

5711
05:15:20,690 --> 05:15:21,230
Thank you.

5712
05:15:28,470 --> 05:15:30,080
Oh, there's a Doc I...

5713
05:15:30,610 --> 05:15:31,530
I have to heal.

5714
05:15:32,690 --> 05:15:33,430
Oh my god.

5715
05:15:36,150 --> 05:15:38,090
You're so healthy everybody.

5716
05:15:38,090 --> 05:15:40,570
Everybody, you're so healthy.

5717
05:15:41,130 --> 05:15:42,870
You're so healthy.

5718
05:15:44,770 --> 05:15:46,610
Guys, I don't think they were healthy.

5719
05:15:46,890 --> 05:15:48,150
I don't...

5720
05:15:52,330 --> 05:15:54,570
Guys, I don't think...

5721
05:15:54,570 --> 05:15:57,170
I don't think they were healthy.

5722
05:15:57,510 --> 05:15:58,350
Guys...

5723
05:15:58,350 --> 05:16:01,010
I don't think people are healthy.

5724
05:16:03,230 --> 05:16:05,530
Maybe not that healthy.

5725
05:16:07,530 --> 05:16:08,370
Maybe...

5726
05:16:39,240 --> 05:16:46,660
I shine in darkness Hey guys, how's your weekend?

5727
05:16:50,000 --> 05:16:53,060
Hey guys, don't we all love Marvel Rivals?

05:17:39,460 --> 05:17:41,020
So even if they- whoa!

5737
05:17:44,480 --> 05:17:45,240
Um...

5738
05:17:46,560 --> 05:17:48,300
There's a Wolverine top left.

5739
05:17:50,820 --> 05:17:54,120
I'm a little scared too about that Wolverine.

5740
05:17:59,380 --> 05:18:00,980
There's a change behind us.

5741
05:18:01,640 --> 05:18:02,980
Oh my god!

5742
05:18:16,090 --> 05:18:20,210
Um... um... um... um...

I'm so excited to have that vehicle!

5744
05:18:23,910 --> 05:18:24,810
Final score.

5745
05:18:25,150 --> 05:18:26,830
Three, two, four.

5746
05:18:27,710 --> 05:18:28,970
What happened?

5747
05:18:38,320 --> 05:18:39,610
Holy shit!

5748
05:18:46,630 --> 05:18:48,770
What the fuck?

5749
05:18:49,030 --> 05:18:50,490
Just a little guy!

5750
05:18:55,820 --> 05:18:56,980
It's bad!

5751
05:18:57,700 --> 05:18:58,900
Holy shit!

5752
05:19:02,920 --> 05:19:04,080
Hey, um...

5753
05:19:04,080 --> 05:19:08,280
Guys, maybe in the end, I'm the win trader in the end.

5754
05:19:08,440 --> 05:19:08,840
Guys.

5755
05:19:09,980 --> 05:19:14,440
Guys, maybe like I'm the win trader in the end, chat.

5756
05:19:20,140 --> 05:19:22,760
Just- but like it's not a- No!

5757
05:19:23,160 --> 05:19:24,120
Shit!

5758
05:19:29,300 --> 05:19:30,400
He's gone.

5759
05:19:35,420 --> 05:19:37,440
But like it's not on purpose.

5760
05:19:37,800 --> 05:19:40,160
It's just my sheer existence.

5761
05:19:40,920 --> 05:19:42,880
My sheer existence.

5762
05:19:44,360 --> 05:19:46,160
Bro, actually.

5763
05:19:47,220 --> 05:19:50,020
Guys, no, no, it doesn't end yet.

5764
05:19:50,140 --> 05:19:52,900
They said tomorrow, unless they don't show up.

5765
05:19:53,240 --> 05:19:55,140
Then maybe like, I don't know.

5766
05:19:55,300 --> 05:19:58,100
I don't know if tomorrow's real anymore after that game.

5767
05:19:58,580 --> 05:20:02,860
I- I don't know if tomorrow's real anymore, chat.

5768
05:20:03,260 --> 05:20:04,700
I- I can't tell.

5769
05:20:06,720 --> 05:20:07,720
Guys, no!

5770
05:20:07,960 --> 05:20:13,420
We still have- Oh shit, we're bringing- Guys, I told you, it's okay!

5771
05:20:14,320 --> 05:20:16,520
We're bringing reinforcements.

5772
05:20:17,080 --> 05:20:18,340
It's okay!

5773
05:20:19,320 --> 05:20:21,040
It's- it's so back!

5774
05:20:21,140 --> 05:20:22,220
We're so back!

5775
05:20:23,140 --> 05:20:25,800
I told you guys, we're so back.

5776
05:20:27,300 --> 05:20:29,160
And the dream is real.

5777
05:20:31,200 --> 05:20:32,500
It's okay, everybody.

5778
05:20:33,580 --> 05:20:35,080
Thank God.

5779
05:20:37,580 --> 05:20:40,080
You guys get to keep your houses!

5780
05:20:40,600 --> 05:20:44,580
But then like, I don't know, 50%- 50% of you guys get to keep your houses.

5781
05:20:44,740 --> 05:20:47,520
50% of you guys are gonna lose your houses, so we don't know.

5782
05:20:48,460 --> 05:20:49,760
Where are the reinforcements?

5783
05:20:49,960 --> 05:20:50,700
Who are they?

5784
05:20:51,780 --> 05:20:55,400
Cover- It doesn't matter if I cover up my screen!

5785
05:20:56,640 --> 05:20:57,600
Who's Hogs?

5786
05:20:59,440 --> 05:21:00,500
Who's this guy?

5787
05:21:04,050 --> 05:21:05,430
Oh, he's a Hog player!

5788
05:21:09,160 --> 05:21:11,720
I don't know these people, to be fair.

5789
05:21:12,580 --> 05:21:15,600
I don't- I don't really know, like...

5790
05:21:16,220 --> 05:21:22,220
I really don't know- I don't really know, like, the people in the pro scene, to be fair.

5791
05:21:23,620 --> 05:21:25,560
Oh, it's a- He's a...

5792
05:21:25,560 --> 05:21:27,240
He's- Oh, he's their tank player?

5793
05:21:27,700 --> 05:21:28,220
Oh!

5794
05:21:28,920 --> 05:21:29,980
He's their tank player?

5795
05:21:30,420 --> 05:21:31,720
What happened to Mace?

5796
05:21:32,340 --> 05:21:33,080
Is he okay?

5797
05:21:33,080 --> 05:21:40,280
Is he- Is he- Is he- Okay, but like, is he okay?

5798
05:21:44,360 --> 05:21:50,500
I just need somebody to call him.

5799
05:21:53,920 --> 05:21:59,580
Mace, inform me that whatever he said in- Did we get an edit on the squad?

5800
05:22:00,360 --> 05:22:04,840
Can we- Can we get an edit on the squad list?

5801
05:22:07,700 --> 05:22:16,460
It's obviously- Someone please check on- I think after that game, I think something- I think something broke.

5802
05:22:18,300 --> 05:22:18,980
Hey, guys!

5803
05:22:20,120 --> 05:22:23,960
Let's mark that off a checklist on another pro player that...

5804
05:22:25,780 --> 05:22:27,980
That Doki Bird broke.

5805
05:22:27,980 --> 05:22:29,620
Kuroba smack-talked me?

5806
05:22:29,780 --> 05:22:30,660
Oh, not surprised!

5807
05:22:30,940 --> 05:22:31,600
I was terrible.

5808
05:22:37,680 --> 05:22:39,160
I'm not surprised.

5809
05:22:39,680 --> 05:22:44,880
I'm not- This man is used to playing with actual good support players.

5810
05:22:45,860 --> 05:22:49,460
I'm just a VTuber trying to make it in this small world.

5811
05:22:54,650 --> 05:22:57,810
Like, it's not- I'm not- I'm- It's like...

5812
05:22:57,810 --> 05:22:59,310
Uh, I'm aware.

5813
05:23:03,870 --> 05:23:08,750
He's- He's used to playing with players who, like, VOD reviews and scrims.

5814
05:23:09,190 --> 05:23:11,250
And, uh...

5815
05:23:12,210 --> 05:23:15,130
And, uh, and I'm doing the best I can.

5816
05:23:16,110 --> 05:23:19,230
I'm doing the best I can in this tiny world.

5817
05:23:21,350 --> 05:23:22,590
Hey, Sinatraa.

5818
05:23:32,430 --> 05:23:32,870
Yeah!

5819
05:23:51,330 --> 05:23:54,250
I knew what- No, and then more so, like...

5820
05:23:54,250 --> 05:23:58,630
Cause pro players, like I said, pro players, all they do is just...

5821
05:23:58,630 --> 05:24:01,270
They, like, play the game 24-7.

5822
05:24:01,990 --> 05:24:05,330
And, like, they do scrims and then they do VOD reviews and everything.

5823
05:24:05,530 --> 05:24:08,010
So they're very aware of, like, the stuff they're doing.

5824
05:24:08,770 --> 05:24:13,430
I, like, bash my head against the wall until- I basically learn by brute force.

5825
05:24:13,950 --> 05:24:18,930
I don't, like, learn from- I learn by brute force and I learn by, like, watching other streamers.

5826
05:24:19,110 --> 05:24:26,810
But, like, obviously pros have more- are used to a higher level of play than, like, what the fuck I am.

5827
05:24:26,870 --> 05:24:29,690
Cause I'm just, like... I'm trying.

5828
05:24:41,700 --> 05:24:46,960
Cause they learn by, like- Cause, like, for them- Cause, like, for them in the tournament setting...

5829
05:24:47,800 --> 05:24:48,500
What's up?

5830
05:24:49,480 --> 05:24:54,260
In the tournament setting, they can't make a mistake cause that basically is, like, their winnings and everything.

5831
05:24:54,440 --> 05:24:55,900
Like, their tournament winnings and stuff.

5832
05:24:56,300 --> 05:25:01,160
But, like, for me, for me, like, all I lose is just my rank points.

5833
05:25:01,440 --> 05:25:06,660
Like, so, like, I'm okay- Okay, I'm okay if a pro player calls me bad.

5834
05:25:06,980 --> 05:25:09,100
Because, like, they know what they're talking about.

5835
05:25:09,320 --> 05:25:13,080
What I'm not okay is some fucking random calling me bad.

5836
05:25:13,140 --> 05:25:15,780
Cause what the fuck are you- What do you know?

5837
05:25:15,780 --> 05:25:17,540
You're just like me.

5838
05:25:17,560 --> 05:25:22,760
You're just like me.

5839
05:25:22,900 --> 05:25:24,160
What do you know?

5840
05:25:30,660 --> 05:25:32,380
So, like, I don't feel bad.

5841
05:25:32,480 --> 05:25:34,160
I'm like, that's valid criticism.

5842
05:25:36,000 --> 05:25:39,900
If a pro player calls me out, that's valid.

5843
05:25:42,960 --> 05:25:45,820
We are the same versus we are not the same.

5844
05:25:48,680 --> 05:25:50,160
Get damaged or something.

5845
05:25:50,300 --> 05:25:51,060
Oh, behind.

5846
05:25:59,110 --> 05:25:59,750
They have a Haka.

5847
05:26:01,770 --> 05:26:02,970
Oh, my god.

5848
05:26:09,810 --> 05:26:10,770
Oh, no.

5849
05:26:12,590 --> 05:26:14,450
I don't have enough heals.

5850
05:26:16,910 --> 05:26:19,010
I don't have enough heals.

5851
05:26:21,490 --> 05:26:22,170
No!

5852
05:26:27,550 --> 05:26:28,230
That's not good.

5853
05:26:29,710 --> 05:26:30,110
That's okay.

5854
05:26:33,810 --> 05:26:34,710
It's fine.

5855
05:26:34,790 --> 05:26:35,450
We got it.

5856
05:26:35,510 --> 05:26:36,090
It's fine.

5857
05:26:36,230 --> 05:26:37,630
Everything will be okay.

5858
05:26:38,610 --> 05:26:44,070
Everything will be- Why is everybody- Holy shit, everybody's been maxing right now.

5859
05:26:45,070 --> 05:26:46,250
That's actually crazy.

5860
05:26:46,430 --> 05:26:48,070
Like, I'm- What do I do?

5861
05:26:49,830 --> 05:26:53,910
Everybody has been- Everybody is forced stacking from rank one.

5862
05:26:54,610 --> 05:26:56,270
What do I do?

5863
05:26:57,690 --> 05:27:00,090
Bro, that's a different forced stack.

5864
05:27:00,490 --> 05:27:04,070
That's a different rank one force- There's two heal behind us.

5865
05:27:09,180 --> 05:27:10,760
Oh, that's fine.

5866
05:27:20,120 --> 05:27:21,880
Oh, my god.

5867
05:27:22,720 --> 05:27:24,280
No, that's a forced stack.

5868
05:27:24,900 --> 05:27:29,380
Uh, Kal, Nectar, Speed, Mun- That's a forced stack.

5869
05:27:30,180 --> 05:27:35,200
I know, cause like- I know that- Cause they're trying to get rank one, too.

5870
05:27:45,030 --> 05:27:45,830
It's fine.

5871
05:27:47,550 --> 05:27:48,330
It's so fine.

5872
05:27:48,370 --> 05:27:49,530
Are you okay over there?

5873
05:27:50,190 --> 05:27:52,650
No, no.

5874
05:27:52,750 --> 05:27:53,410
Are you okay?

5875
05:27:53,710 --> 05:27:54,590
Are you okay?

5876
05:28:01,630 --> 05:28:02,590
I'm gonna try.

5877
05:28:03,050 --> 05:28:03,850
I got you.

5878
05:28:07,230 --> 05:28:08,210
We can kill this.

5879
05:28:08,270 --> 05:28:08,570
Change.

5880
05:28:08,730 --> 05:28:09,030
I'm good.

5881
05:28:09,110 --> 05:28:09,470
I'm good.

5882
05:28:09,490 --> 05:28:09,830
I'm good.

5883
05:28:09,990 --> 05:28:10,930
You're so healthy.

5884
05:28:13,870 --> 05:28:14,890
We got it.

5885
05:28:15,290 --> 05:28:15,970
Oh, my god.

5886
05:28:16,010 --> 05:28:21,470
Everybody won- Everybody is like grinding for rank one, and I'm here being like- Oh, my god.

5887
05:28:21,510 --> 05:28:23,570
Wouldn't it be cool if I get to be top 500?

5888
05:28:23,870 --> 05:28:24,830
That would be so cool.

5889
05:28:25,270 --> 05:28:25,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5890
05:28:26,930 --> 05:28:29,290
I can't- You're damage boosted.

5891
05:28:29,330 --> 05:28:29,870
You're damage boosted.

5892
05:28:32,070 --> 05:28:32,550
Oh.

5893
05:28:47,590 --> 05:28:49,110
I have No More on me.

5894
05:28:49,930 --> 05:28:50,530
No More is half.

5895
05:28:51,830 --> 05:28:52,030
Fear.

5896
05:28:52,270 --> 05:28:52,450
Fear.

5897
05:28:52,750 --> 05:28:52,930
Fear.

5898
05:28:53,190 --> 05:28:53,350
Fear.

5899
05:28:53,590 --> 05:28:53,750
Fear.

5900
05:28:53,990 --> 05:28:54,730
You're so healthy.

5901
05:28:54,970 --> 05:28:55,730
You're so healthy.

5902
05:28:56,110 --> 05:28:57,070
You're so healthy.

5903
05:28:58,510 --> 05:29:00,010
No More is still right.

5904
05:29:00,330 --> 05:29:01,190
We got it.

5905
05:29:01,290 --> 05:29:01,970
We got it.

5906
05:29:03,370 --> 05:29:04,850
Oh, you're fine.

5907
05:29:04,910 --> 05:29:05,410
You're so healthy.

5908
05:29:10,350 --> 05:29:13,110
Oh, my god.

5909
05:29:13,510 --> 05:29:14,330
I don't think we need it.

5910
05:29:15,130 --> 05:29:15,470
Oh!

5911
05:29:21,940 --> 05:29:24,120
I've damage boosted him!

5912
05:29:24,360 --> 05:29:25,780
Damage boosted streamer!

5913
05:29:30,260 --> 05:29:31,380
You want Orbs in?

5914
05:29:31,560 --> 05:29:31,940
Oh.

5915
05:29:34,740 --> 05:29:35,240
That's fine.

5916
05:29:36,340 --> 05:29:37,240
That's not okay.

5917
05:29:37,340 --> 05:29:37,640
It's fine.

5918
05:29:37,700 --> 05:29:38,460
We're so healthy.

5919
05:29:39,400 --> 05:29:40,560
We're so healthy.

5920
05:29:42,320 --> 05:29:43,260
We're so- Oh.

5921
05:29:43,600 --> 05:29:44,800
Fuck, I'm not healthy.

5922
05:29:45,820 --> 05:29:46,820
Oh, I'm not though.

5923
05:29:52,800 --> 05:29:53,560
Oh, okay.

5924
05:29:53,800 --> 05:29:54,440
I don't have leaves.

5925
05:29:55,780 --> 05:29:56,620
There's no more to it, right?

5926
05:29:56,640 --> 05:29:59,240
There's no more- You're damage boosted?

5927
05:30:02,950 --> 05:30:03,430
Oh.

5928
05:30:05,430 --> 05:30:05,910
Oh.

5929
05:30:08,990 --> 05:30:10,670
I'm opening a portal.

5930
05:30:12,570 --> 05:30:14,230
What is this bug about?

5931
05:30:17,070 --> 05:30:18,670
There's still a chance to stop them!

5932
05:30:18,830 --> 05:30:18,930
Okay.

5933
05:30:19,070 --> 05:30:19,350
I have Luna.

5934
05:30:19,470 --> 05:30:19,670
I have Luna.

5935
05:30:19,910 --> 05:30:20,070
Drop.

5936
05:30:20,190 --> 05:30:20,210
Drop.

5937
05:30:20,390 --> 05:30:20,390
Drop.

5938
05:30:20,670 --> 05:30:20,850
Go.

5939
05:30:22,070 --> 05:30:25,930
Oh, he's never missing.

5940
05:30:27,570 --> 05:30:28,850
He's never missing.

5941
05:30:29,450 --> 05:30:29,770
Fine.

5942
05:30:30,270 --> 05:30:32,790
Wait, there's a Bucky- There's a Panther by us.

5943
05:30:37,180 --> 05:30:37,900
I'm ulting.

5944
05:30:38,400 --> 05:30:40,660
By the eye of Agamotto!

5945
05:30:40,760 --> 05:30:41,520
Shoot!

5946
05:30:42,040 --> 05:30:42,480
Shoot!

5947
05:30:42,740 --> 05:30:42,860
Shoot!

5948
05:30:44,300 --> 05:30:45,680
I have shrooms on me!

5949
05:30:45,780 --> 05:30:46,100
Shrooms up!

5950
05:30:46,380 --> 05:30:46,840
Shrooms one!

5951
05:30:50,080 --> 05:30:51,400
Oh my god!

5952
05:30:56,000 --> 05:30:57,640
Do they have support or no?

5953
05:30:57,920 --> 05:31:02,480
I don't think they have Luna yet.

5954
05:31:02,620 --> 05:31:03,280
I'm gonna go quick.

5955
05:31:03,920 --> 05:31:05,940
Wait, where are you?

5956
05:31:06,060 --> 05:31:06,640
Okay, I got you.

5957
05:31:09,360 --> 05:31:10,180
Don't damage them.

5958
05:31:10,180 --> 05:31:11,000
Don't shoot their tank right now.

5959
05:31:11,000 --> 05:31:13,180
Okay, I am a wounded soldier.

5960
05:31:13,800 --> 05:31:14,280
Hey, they have Venom.

5961
05:31:14,340 --> 05:31:15,080
Venom is looking for dive.

5962
05:31:15,300 --> 05:31:16,140
Venom is looking for dive at the top.

5963
05:31:19,120 --> 05:31:19,480
Wait.

5964
05:31:20,340 --> 05:31:21,000
Should we all go?

5965
05:31:21,900 --> 05:31:22,580
Is Venom on me?

5966
05:31:23,000 --> 05:31:23,700
I slept Venom.

5967
05:31:23,800 --> 05:31:24,180
I slept Venom.

5968
05:31:24,660 --> 05:31:25,820
And there's Black Panther on us too.

5969
05:31:27,440 --> 05:31:27,740
Oh!

5970
05:31:29,420 --> 05:31:30,040
Venom one.

5971
05:31:30,560 --> 05:31:30,800
Nice.

5972
05:31:31,360 --> 05:31:32,020
Venom is one.

5973
05:31:32,180 --> 05:31:33,540
Yeah, fuck me, I guess.

5974
05:31:34,040 --> 05:31:34,300
Fuck!

5975
05:31:34,300 --> 05:31:35,240
Oh my god!

5976
05:31:36,960 --> 05:31:38,500
Jjonatra is also streaming!

5977
05:31:38,620 --> 05:31:40,020
Why don't you kill him instead?

5978
05:31:41,600 --> 05:31:43,260
Why kill the streamer?

5979
05:31:43,320 --> 05:31:44,580
There's multiple streamers!

5980
05:31:45,160 --> 05:31:46,220
They still might not have Luna.

5981
05:31:46,400 --> 05:31:46,620
I don't know.

5982
05:31:48,680 --> 05:31:49,560
They should have her.

5983
05:31:50,980 --> 05:31:52,600
Just play like they have her.

5984
05:31:54,160 --> 05:31:56,160
Fuck Vtubers in general though.

5985
05:32:01,900 --> 05:32:03,020
We have...

5986
05:32:03,020 --> 05:32:04,540
I slept Venom.

5987
05:32:04,620 --> 05:32:04,920
I slept Venom.

5988
05:32:09,340 --> 05:32:09,860
What?

5989
05:32:10,140 --> 05:32:10,300
What?

5990
05:32:10,640 --> 05:32:10,860
What?

5991
05:32:11,200 --> 05:32:11,340
What?

5992
05:32:11,920 --> 05:32:12,360
Yeah, yeah.

5993
05:32:12,760 --> 05:32:14,020
It's lagging.

5994
05:32:22,460 --> 05:32:23,620
Change to the right stream.

5995
05:32:26,600 --> 05:32:27,600
There's a planter.

5996
05:32:27,600 --> 05:32:29,100
We're only trapping him.

5997
05:32:31,280 --> 05:32:32,970
Oh my god!

5998
05:32:37,430 --> 05:32:38,580
You're right.

5999
05:32:39,160 --> 05:32:42,100
Everybody's streaming, but there's only one Vtuber.

6000
05:32:42,680 --> 05:32:44,640
There's only one!

6001
05:32:47,270 --> 05:32:51,820
Yeah, I'm running into other streamers when I'm getting fucking farmed.

6002
05:32:52,400 --> 05:32:52,920
Pass.

6003
05:32:53,960 --> 05:32:54,560
Pass please.

6004
05:32:55,400 --> 05:32:57,060
There's so many force stackers.

6005
05:32:58,160 --> 05:33:00,600
And they're all trying to get rank one.

6006
05:33:00,840 --> 05:33:03,800
There's literally force stackers going up trying to get rank one.

6007
05:33:04,380 --> 05:33:07,880
And then my force stack is just trying to make a wish.

6008
05:33:08,080 --> 05:33:10,160
It's just trying to achieve my make a wish.

6009
05:33:14,440 --> 05:33:20,360
There's like this little tiny Vtubers make a wish just to be in top 500.

6010
05:33:24,340 --> 05:33:25,780
That's just...

6011
05:33:28,520 --> 05:33:29,840
You're so lucky.

6012
05:33:29,880 --> 05:33:30,940
You are so lucky.

6013
05:33:31,080 --> 05:33:31,560
Am I?

6014
05:33:32,140 --> 05:33:38,300
I'm down again because all these fucking rank one force stackers are farming me.

6015
05:33:39,120 --> 05:33:41,960
My make a wish is to get absolutely shit on.

6016
05:33:49,710 --> 05:33:53,070
This make a wish streamer don't feel lucky.

6017
05:34:00,270 --> 05:34:01,650
I'm doing great.

6018
05:34:01,730 --> 05:34:03,170
I'm doing great guys.

6019
05:34:08,250 --> 05:34:13,110
At least I make money for getting shit on.

6020
05:34:14,430 --> 05:34:16,090
I'm okay with that.

6021
05:34:26,070 --> 05:34:27,550
More powerful yet.

6022
05:34:28,410 --> 05:34:28,970
Only half.

6023
05:34:31,070 --> 05:34:31,570
Woah.

6024
05:34:33,690 --> 05:34:34,150
Woah.

6025
05:34:36,530 --> 05:34:38,670
I slept him.

6026
05:34:40,150 --> 05:34:41,070
On me.

6027
05:34:41,370 --> 05:34:41,590
Behind.

6028
05:34:42,490 --> 05:34:42,910
Woah.

6029
05:34:44,670 --> 05:34:46,250
Oh my god.

6030
05:34:46,330 --> 05:34:48,590
Who's fucking yelling for heals?

6031
05:34:49,990 --> 05:34:51,710
I got confused.

6032
05:34:52,710 --> 05:34:54,650
I'm actually getting confused.

6033
05:34:56,070 --> 05:34:57,750
I'm so confused.

6034
05:35:01,750 --> 05:35:05,170
I got a little confused there.

6035
05:35:10,250 --> 05:35:10,650
Woah.

6036
05:35:15,790 --> 05:35:18,150
Bro, I get shit on for free.

6037
05:35:18,490 --> 05:35:21,170
I'm practically running a charity.

6038
05:35:26,170 --> 05:35:26,610
Eh.

6039
05:35:28,130 --> 05:35:29,010
Try it.

6040
05:35:32,230 --> 05:35:33,530
There's a turret here.

6041
05:35:35,110 --> 05:35:35,750
There's someone.

6042
05:35:35,890 --> 05:35:36,790
There's an Amur behind us.

6043
05:35:37,050 --> 05:35:37,450
Or in front.

6044
05:35:40,530 --> 05:35:41,450
I am Groot.

6045
05:35:42,550 --> 05:35:43,570
I am Groot.

6046
05:35:44,390 --> 05:35:45,310
I am Groot.

6047
05:35:45,850 --> 05:35:46,550
Here you go.

6048
05:35:47,110 --> 05:35:47,910
I never do ads.

6049
05:35:48,070 --> 05:35:48,730
I don't know how.

6050
05:35:48,850 --> 05:35:52,310
I mean I do know how but I don't do ads on YouTube so I don't do ads here.

6051
05:35:52,310 --> 05:35:53,570
They have everything actually.

6052
05:35:54,190 --> 05:35:57,810
I feel like I should but I don't care enough.

6053
05:35:57,830 --> 05:35:58,630
I make enough.

6054
05:36:00,490 --> 05:36:02,610
I know a lot of Forgs.

6055
05:36:05,850 --> 05:36:08,210
I don't think we need it, right?

6056
05:36:11,070 --> 05:36:11,590
Okay.

6057
05:36:16,910 --> 05:36:18,350
There we go.

6058
05:36:20,150 --> 05:36:21,030
He's asleep.

6059
05:36:22,310 --> 05:36:23,130
Oh, it's after here.

6060
05:36:25,430 --> 05:36:25,970
Actually, no.

6061
05:36:26,070 --> 05:36:26,650
I don't think we need it.

6062
05:36:30,750 --> 05:36:31,270
No!

6063
05:36:40,690 --> 05:36:41,730
Why me?!

6064
05:36:41,730 --> 05:36:42,410
I'm banned!

6065
05:36:42,530 --> 05:36:44,230
Did you not see me run?!

6066
05:36:44,230 --> 05:36:45,430
I was running!

6067
05:36:46,710 --> 05:36:49,430
Did you not see me run?!

6068
05:36:49,430 --> 05:36:52,090
I literally ran for my fucking life!

6069
05:36:53,250 --> 05:36:55,790
I don't have a power in this place.

6070
05:36:58,650 --> 05:37:02,370
He used everything for that, right?

6071
05:37:03,370 --> 05:37:05,650
I'm on a fucking adventure over here so can you help me out here?

6072
05:37:07,510 --> 05:37:08,590
I'm gonna walk up right now.

6073
05:37:09,070 --> 05:37:10,530
I'm trying to heal you.

6074
05:37:14,760 --> 05:37:15,700
I'll walk up with my ult.

6075
05:37:16,080 --> 05:37:18,300
Mag awp, mag awp, mag awp.

6076
05:37:18,420 --> 05:37:19,300
He's still up, he's still up!

6077
05:37:20,840 --> 05:37:21,600
He's one, he's one, he's one!

6078
05:37:24,700 --> 05:37:25,960
We should push, get these kills.

6079
05:37:27,600 --> 05:37:28,580
Rip one, rip one.

6080
05:37:28,620 --> 05:37:30,560
Oh man, I'm damage boosting you, Sinatraa.

6081
05:37:31,820 --> 05:37:33,840
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

6082
05:37:34,140 --> 05:37:38,240
Oh my god, we are grooved!

6083
05:37:38,920 --> 05:37:39,980
At least I have one more push here.

6084
05:37:42,460 --> 05:37:43,940
And I EFTP up.

6085
05:37:46,460 --> 05:37:47,320
You're damage boosting?

6086
05:37:50,540 --> 05:37:50,960
Nice!

6087
05:37:50,960 --> 05:37:51,560
Nice!

6088
05:37:53,200 --> 05:37:54,720
Oh my god!

6089
05:37:58,620 --> 05:38:00,660
Don't fear, lock the fuck in!

6090
05:38:01,380 --> 05:38:03,800
Bro, the last time that I still died!

6091
05:38:03,980 --> 05:38:05,560
It doesn't matter what I do!

6092
05:38:05,940 --> 05:38:07,120
I just die!

6093
05:38:08,000 --> 05:38:09,440
It doesn't matter!

6094
05:38:11,680 --> 05:38:12,620
Oh my god!

6095
05:38:13,080 --> 05:38:13,900
That's right.

6096
05:38:15,640 --> 05:38:16,360
Yay!

6097
05:38:18,160 --> 05:38:21,580
If I can't get top 500, you can't get top 10.

6098
05:38:23,580 --> 05:38:26,940
But it's not toxic, I swear, I just died.

6099
05:38:30,920 --> 05:38:33,480
You can't get rank 1 if I can't.

6100
05:38:33,480 --> 05:38:34,560
I'm gonna...

6101
05:38:34,560 --> 05:38:38,120
You can't get rank 1 if I can't get top 500.

6102
05:38:38,420 --> 05:38:39,500
That's the spirit!

6103
05:38:40,720 --> 05:38:42,720
They literally, they dropped...

6104
05:38:42,720 --> 05:38:44,460
I'm just saying, what we did to them.

6105
05:38:44,460 --> 05:38:48,040
They dropped, like, out of top 5 because of what I...

6106
05:38:48,040 --> 05:38:49,360
They dropped out of, like...

6107
05:38:49,360 --> 05:38:51,660
They dropped two places because of what I did.

6108
05:38:52,660 --> 05:38:53,260
I'm sorry.

6109
05:38:54,160 --> 05:38:55,260
No, they actually dropped...

6110
05:38:55,260 --> 05:38:56,080
Yeah, they dropped out...

6111
05:38:56,080 --> 05:38:57,060
They dropped down.

6112
05:38:59,320 --> 05:39:00,400
I'm sorry.

6113
05:39:01,140 --> 05:39:01,640
I'm not.

6114
05:39:08,580 --> 05:39:09,620
I'm not.

6115
05:39:10,940 --> 05:39:12,060
I'm desperate.

6116
05:39:14,460 --> 05:39:16,460
She said they couldn't...

6117
05:39:16,460 --> 05:39:17,940
Now I'll be on their list.

6118
05:39:20,120 --> 05:39:21,040
What about your stack?

6119
05:39:21,080 --> 05:39:21,580
How much...

6120
05:39:21,580 --> 05:39:22,980
We're not gonna look at it.

6121
05:39:23,040 --> 05:39:24,540
I'd feel bad if I did.

6122
05:39:24,760 --> 05:39:26,720
I'm gonna pretend that, like...

6123
05:39:27,240 --> 05:39:28,940
I'm gonna pretend that...

6124
05:39:28,940 --> 05:39:30,440
They're doing okay.

6125
05:39:36,170 --> 05:39:37,030
I'm gonna...

6126
05:39:37,030 --> 05:39:40,110
I'm gonna pretend that everything is okay.

6127
05:39:43,210 --> 05:39:45,210
No, he's restarting his game.

6128
05:39:47,910 --> 05:39:49,290
I'm gonna use the bathroom, guys.

6129
05:39:49,350 --> 05:39:49,970
I'll be right back.

6130
05:39:50,410 --> 05:39:52,350
The less I know, the better, exactly.

6131
05:41:05,380 --> 05:41:06,160
I'm back.

6132
05:41:06,960 --> 05:41:08,660
What do you mean, villainous clips?

6133
05:41:09,680 --> 05:41:10,560
I'm an angel.

6134
05:41:11,920 --> 05:41:13,040
What do you mean?

6135
05:41:13,320 --> 05:41:14,540
I'm a fucking angel.

6136
05:41:16,340 --> 05:41:20,920
If anything, I might be the happiest Marble Rivals streamer right now.

6137
05:41:23,160 --> 05:41:23,720
Like...

6138
05:41:25,140 --> 05:41:31,540
It's no denying of a fact that I might be the happiest one out of everybody.

6139
05:41:32,520 --> 05:41:34,880
That might be true.

6140
05:41:35,540 --> 05:41:39,720
If anything...

6141
05:41:40,840 --> 05:41:44,700
I'm the least depressed when I play Marble Rivals.

6142
05:41:49,080 --> 05:41:50,640
Oh my god, they're grooting it.

6143
05:41:50,760 --> 05:41:51,520
I'm not gonna...

6144
05:41:55,360 --> 05:41:56,000
What?

6145
05:41:57,940 --> 05:41:59,180
Are you still...

6146
05:41:59,180 --> 05:42:01,920
He wasn't even there for the Iron Fist.

6147
05:42:02,180 --> 05:42:05,000
He wasn't even there for it.

6148
05:42:05,540 --> 05:42:06,000
I...

6149
05:42:12,200 --> 05:42:12,840
Bro.

6150
05:42:13,740 --> 05:42:16,580
Gomez, I understand, but he wasn't even there.

6151
05:42:18,400 --> 05:42:19,960
Groot made a house.

6152
05:42:20,100 --> 05:42:20,520
Look at me.

6153
05:42:20,920 --> 05:42:22,660
He made a house for the Iron Fist.

6154
05:42:22,660 --> 05:42:26,040
They're building a generational...

6155
05:42:26,040 --> 05:42:26,480
You're right.

6156
05:42:26,560 --> 05:42:29,200
This is like generational hatred right there.

6157
05:42:30,320 --> 05:42:31,720
They might have the same...

6158
05:42:31,720 --> 05:42:32,400
Maybe you're right.

6159
05:42:32,800 --> 05:42:33,540
Maybe what's his name?

6160
05:42:34,220 --> 05:42:37,940
FatBuckMac has terrorized Hog's lobbies too.

6161
05:42:38,980 --> 05:42:39,720
That's like being...

6162
05:42:40,360 --> 05:42:41,320
Oh my god.

6163
05:42:45,700 --> 05:42:46,340
Yay.

6164
05:42:46,340 --> 05:42:46,580
Yay.

6165
05:42:51,280 --> 05:42:53,320
FatBuckMac, that's literally...

6166
05:42:53,320 --> 05:42:57,600
That's literally the trauma that they all have.

6167
05:42:58,360 --> 05:42:59,060
What are they doing?

6168
05:43:01,560 --> 05:43:02,980
Are they grooting it?

6169
05:43:03,320 --> 05:43:04,320
Are they gonna groot all over?

6170
05:43:07,060 --> 05:43:08,380
What are they trying to do?

6171
05:43:09,780 --> 05:43:11,720
What are they trying to build this house for?

6172
05:43:13,280 --> 05:43:15,860
Are they playing Minecraft?

6173
05:43:22,800 --> 05:43:24,540
It's like...

6174
05:43:24,540 --> 05:43:26,120
Oh my god, we're in Minecraft.

6175
05:43:27,200 --> 05:43:29,720
It's beautiful.

6176
05:43:31,260 --> 05:43:32,660
It's so beautiful.

6177
05:43:33,300 --> 05:43:34,380
This is...

6178
05:43:34,380 --> 05:43:38,160
Oh my god, it's not gonna cost fucking a million dollars.

6179
05:43:39,780 --> 05:43:41,240
Groot crap.

6180
05:43:41,240 --> 05:43:42,320
Wait, actually...

6181
05:43:43,000 --> 05:43:44,440
No, it's...

6182
05:43:45,220 --> 05:43:47,700
No, it's not, because there's a hole right here.

6183
05:43:48,220 --> 05:43:49,960
There's literally a hole right here.

6184
05:43:50,040 --> 05:43:51,320
Like, what the fuck are they gonna do?

6185
05:43:56,060 --> 05:43:59,560
If that was New York City, the rent would be like...

6186
05:43:59,560 --> 05:44:01,740
Like 500k a month.

6187
05:44:03,220 --> 05:44:04,340
That's a bit too...

6188
05:44:04,340 --> 05:44:06,240
It's natural lighting, Toki.

6189
05:44:06,300 --> 05:44:07,320
You don't understand.

6190
05:44:07,320 --> 05:44:07,600
Oh my god.

6191
05:44:08,980 --> 05:44:12,280
It's like 200k in Utah.

6192
05:44:12,960 --> 05:44:14,460
Free air conditioning.

6193
05:44:14,960 --> 05:44:20,920
The central air.

6194
05:44:20,920 --> 05:44:22,920
So I'm just gonna say, let's respect it.

6195
05:44:23,660 --> 05:44:24,780
Nevermind, they can't...

6196
05:44:24,780 --> 05:44:26,320
Versus AntiMark, ok, GG, we won.

6197
05:44:30,740 --> 05:44:32,160
The central air.

6198
05:44:34,400 --> 05:44:36,620
Thank you, I'm glad you guys enjoy my pain.

6199
05:44:39,140 --> 05:44:39,960
I'm glad.

6200
05:44:41,200 --> 05:44:42,340
They don't know about Adam!

6201
05:44:42,720 --> 05:44:44,740
They don't know Kuroba is an Adam player!

6202
05:44:45,360 --> 05:44:46,380
They don't know.

6203
05:44:46,880 --> 05:44:48,640
You know what would solve Kuroba's problem?

6204
05:44:53,440 --> 05:44:55,040
Oh wait, he didn't put that on his title.

6205
05:44:55,260 --> 05:44:59,380
Okay, because like the last time I watched his stream, he would put on his title...

6206
05:44:59,380 --> 05:45:02,180
Number 1 Adam player, but he didn't.

6207
05:45:02,300 --> 05:45:04,640
I don't know if he removed it, because...

6208
05:45:08,320 --> 05:45:13,120
I don't know if he removed it, because of this, but like... Oh, look at that!

6209
05:45:13,400 --> 05:45:14,200
It's great!

6210
05:45:15,140 --> 05:45:15,580
No,

6211
05:45:18,840 --> 05:45:21,620
he literally just wrote Rank with X these people.

6212
05:45:25,990 --> 05:45:32,270
Oh my god, I was gonna say, if I see- If I looked up Kuroba and I see Number 1 Adam, you know who I'm banning.

6213
05:45:32,770 --> 05:45:34,390
You know who I'm target banning.

6214
05:45:40,350 --> 05:45:41,730
Hey, that's not bad!

6215
05:45:47,530 --> 05:45:51,910
I'm like, watching me is like a PSA to not... not...

6216
05:45:52,510 --> 05:45:54,050
To not go full Rivals.

6217
05:45:54,870 --> 05:45:58,190
I told you guys, I'm like the... I'm like the...

6218
05:45:58,190 --> 05:46:02,090
Do not- Do not smoke on a- On a cigarette carton.

6219
05:46:02,370 --> 05:46:04,210
Like, this is what happens when you smoke.

6220
05:46:04,490 --> 05:46:05,630
But you still buy it anyway.

6221
05:46:06,470 --> 05:46:08,830
But you still buy it anyway.

6222
05:46:09,310 --> 05:46:11,790
This is your lungs when you're on Marvel Rivals.

6223
05:46:19,410 --> 05:46:22,510
And then you're like, hey, maybe- Hey, it actually looks a little fun.

6224
05:46:22,690 --> 05:46:23,510
Looks pretty fun.

6225
05:46:24,350 --> 05:46:26,930
We buy it to support you.

6226
05:46:27,990 --> 05:46:29,710
3... 2... 1!

6227
05:46:30,710 --> 05:46:35,710
Don't say that to my- To this- Where is my sponsorship?!

6228
05:46:35,710 --> 05:46:37,330
Where is it?!

6229
05:46:40,430 --> 05:46:41,070
Oh...

6230
05:46:42,150 --> 05:46:43,850
But then we can go.

6231
05:46:44,370 --> 05:46:45,050
I'm scared.

6232
05:46:45,630 --> 05:46:47,130
What if I fuck it up?

6233
05:46:49,850 --> 05:46:51,730
Yeah, I didn't fuck it up, guys.

6234
05:46:53,390 --> 05:46:54,290
Let's go!

6235
05:46:55,270 --> 05:46:58,790
I was like, they were all so confident!

6236
05:46:59,330 --> 05:47:01,270
Oh my god!

6237
05:47:06,450 --> 05:47:09,010
That was unfortunate, though.

6238
05:47:09,750 --> 05:47:11,130
I got hella'd.

6239
05:47:12,310 --> 05:47:13,850
I got fucking hella'd.

6240
05:47:16,390 --> 05:47:20,310
Hey guys, I don't- Oh!

6241
05:47:20,670 --> 05:47:21,370
Yeah, we killed Ella.

6242
05:47:22,330 --> 05:47:23,830
That's fucking right, bitch!

6243
05:47:28,310 --> 05:47:29,830
Oh my god!

6244
05:47:29,950 --> 05:47:30,310
Alright.

6245
05:47:34,940 --> 05:47:36,800
Oh my god, I'm scared.

6246
05:47:37,000 --> 05:47:37,920
I'm very scared.

6247
05:47:39,740 --> 05:47:41,460
I'm very scared here.

6248
05:47:47,860 --> 05:47:49,700
I'm very scared, guys.

6249
05:47:49,840 --> 05:47:51,120
Magneto's- Oh, nevermind.

6250
05:47:51,580 --> 05:47:52,220
Nevermind.

6251
05:47:53,620 --> 05:47:55,020
Wait, um- Change low!

6252
05:47:55,100 --> 05:47:55,460
Change low!

6253
05:47:56,580 --> 05:47:57,420
Fear.

6254
05:47:57,840 --> 05:47:57,840
Fear.

6255
05:47:57,920 --> 05:47:58,080
Fear.

6256
05:47:58,220 --> 05:47:58,420
Fear.

6257
05:47:58,720 --> 05:47:58,760
Fear.

6258
05:47:58,880 --> 05:47:58,880
Fear.

6259
05:47:58,940 --> 05:47:59,020
Fear.

6260
05:47:59,540 --> 05:48:08,100
Oh my god.

6261
05:48:08,320 --> 05:48:10,440
What can I do?

6262
05:48:11,280 --> 05:48:13,280
What can I do?

6263
05:48:19,040 --> 05:48:23,880
Oh my god.

6264
05:48:33,780 --> 05:48:34,840
Oh, whatever.

6265
05:48:35,320 --> 05:48:35,800
Fuck this.

6266
05:48:35,940 --> 05:48:37,100
I've had enough.

6267
05:48:37,620 --> 05:48:40,580
I've fucking- I've had enough of this.

6268
05:48:40,660 --> 05:48:41,800
They're gonna change ult after this.

6269
05:48:47,890 --> 05:48:48,750
Come on.

6270
05:48:54,540 --> 05:48:56,100
Come on, Magneto.

6271
05:48:56,240 --> 05:48:56,880
Magneto has.

6272
05:49:03,170 --> 05:49:03,810
Oh my god.

6273
05:49:04,270 --> 05:49:06,070
Oh hey, fuck that clone in general!

6274
05:49:10,790 --> 05:49:11,750
I'm Groot.

6275
05:49:14,010 --> 05:49:14,730
Alright.

6276
05:49:15,450 --> 05:49:19,530
Chat, get off of Magneto's dick.

6277
05:49:21,590 --> 05:49:24,130
Guys, you gotta repopulate the mutant population.

6278
05:49:34,310 --> 05:49:37,250
How else will he saw mutantkind?

6279
05:49:37,870 --> 05:49:39,310
How else will he fix it?

6280
05:49:40,470 --> 05:49:45,830
Every kid he gets, it's another mutant and they're so overpowered as fuck.

6281
05:49:46,850 --> 05:49:48,250
Like fastest guy alive?

6282
05:49:48,450 --> 05:49:49,710
That's like Quicksilver?

6283
05:49:49,990 --> 05:49:50,790
Fucking hell.

6284
05:49:51,150 --> 05:49:51,930
Scarlet Witch?

6285
05:49:52,030 --> 05:49:53,090
Like that shit's broken.

6286
05:50:08,220 --> 05:50:08,880
Good!

6287
05:50:10,760 --> 05:50:11,420
Good.

6288
05:50:12,400 --> 05:50:12,580
Fear.

6289
05:50:12,780 --> 05:50:12,980
Fear.

6290
05:50:13,360 --> 05:50:13,540
Fear.

6291
05:50:13,860 --> 05:50:13,980
Fear.

6292
05:50:14,300 --> 05:50:14,480
Fear.

6293
05:50:14,740 --> 05:50:14,960
Fear.

6294
05:50:15,380 --> 05:50:15,520
Fear.

6295
05:50:19,520 --> 05:50:20,820
Are we winning this?

6296
05:50:21,440 --> 05:50:22,240
I can't tell.

6297
05:50:23,180 --> 05:50:24,180
I can't tell.

6298
05:50:24,860 --> 05:50:27,280
I'm just- I don't know.

6299
05:50:27,800 --> 05:50:30,040
I- I don't know.

6300
05:50:31,060 --> 05:50:32,960
I saw-

6301
05:50:38,600 --> 05:50:44,940
Goodbye, Hogs.

6302
05:50:48,080 --> 05:50:52,040
Wait, why did we- I think we're-

6303
05:50:55,700 --> 05:50:57,060
Oh my god.

6304
05:50:57,120 --> 05:50:58,740
Oh my god.

6305
05:50:58,940 --> 05:51:00,580
Is everybody okay?

6306
05:51:01,320 --> 05:51:01,920
Is-

6307
05:51:06,280 --> 05:51:07,720
I'm not okay!

6308
05:51:08,560 --> 05:51:09,080
Nope.

6309
05:51:09,240 --> 05:51:09,520
Nope.

6310
05:51:09,680 --> 05:51:10,060
Nope.

6311
05:51:10,400 --> 05:51:10,920
No.

6312
05:51:13,560 --> 05:51:18,200
Guys, I- I might have- I shouldn't have said that.

6313
05:51:18,720 --> 05:51:20,800
I should not have said if everybody's okay.

6314
05:51:21,400 --> 05:51:24,500
I think everybody was not okay, guys.

6315
05:51:25,040 --> 05:51:30,300
I- I- Guys, I don't think everybody was okay, guys.

6316
05:51:32,380 --> 05:51:34,020
Oh shit, we have the combo.

6317
05:51:37,590 --> 05:51:39,390
We have the combo, guys.

6318
05:51:40,970 --> 05:51:42,930
That hella player's insane, though.

6319
05:51:47,860 --> 05:51:52,780
Oh my god, that- Fear Magneto!

6320
05:51:53,680 --> 05:51:54,660
Oh, thank god.

6321
05:51:55,060 --> 05:51:56,360
Oh, thank god.

6322
05:51:57,020 --> 05:51:58,040
Oh, thank god.

6323
05:51:58,620 --> 05:52:00,020
Oh, thank god.

6324
05:52:07,210 --> 05:52:08,910
Are we gonna be okay?

6325
05:52:09,710 --> 05:52:13,630
Are we- Are we- Are we gonna be okay, guys?

6326
05:52:14,350 --> 05:52:14,930
Nice.

6327
05:52:17,030 --> 05:52:17,810
Nice.

6328
05:52:20,450 --> 05:52:21,230
Yay!

6329
05:52:26,350 --> 05:52:26,910
Yay!

6330
05:52:28,650 --> 05:52:29,390
Who first?

6331
05:52:29,510 --> 05:52:30,310
I go first.

6332
05:52:30,410 --> 05:52:30,730
Okay.

6333
05:52:32,270 --> 05:52:37,690
I like how he's like- He asked and he's like, I go first.

6334
05:52:38,290 --> 05:52:39,670
I'm gonna have to use it.

6335
05:52:39,950 --> 05:52:41,430
I have to use it.

6336
05:52:41,630 --> 05:52:42,910
You- You- You did it.

6337
05:52:43,330 --> 05:52:49,530
He didn't fucking ult in the direction of the guys that got ulted, so I had to ult.

6338
05:52:49,530 --> 05:52:51,490
What the fuck?

6339
05:52:53,210 --> 05:52:55,130
He's like, don't worry, I'll go first.

6340
05:52:55,330 --> 05:52:57,690
And then the ult was not even on.

6341
05:52:58,010 --> 05:52:59,470
Was not even on.

6342
05:53:01,470 --> 05:53:02,110
Fear.

6343
05:53:03,430 --> 05:53:03,890
Fear.

6344
05:53:04,230 --> 05:53:04,710
Fear.

6345
05:53:05,550 --> 05:53:06,190
Fear.

6346
05:53:06,430 --> 05:53:07,090
I'm alive.

6347
05:53:08,490 --> 05:53:09,390
I'm alive.

6348
05:53:09,530 --> 05:53:09,890
I'm alive.

6349
05:53:09,990 --> 05:53:10,450
I'm alive.

6350
05:53:10,550 --> 05:53:10,990
I'm alive.

6351
05:53:12,070 --> 05:53:13,070
Oh my god.

6352
05:53:17,100 --> 05:53:18,140
Oh no.

6353
05:53:18,840 --> 05:53:19,260
Hello.

6354
05:53:21,380 --> 05:53:22,700
How did you live?

6355
05:53:24,400 --> 05:53:25,360
Past tense.

6356
05:53:26,120 --> 05:53:26,980
Who first?

6357
05:53:27,080 --> 05:53:27,600
Don't care.

6358
05:53:27,880 --> 05:53:28,820
Me first.

6359
05:53:29,300 --> 05:53:32,880
I wouldn't have ulted if her ult was on us.

6360
05:53:33,360 --> 05:53:39,280
Her ult was literally behind us- like in front of us, so I had to.

6361
05:53:45,290 --> 05:53:46,990
We are on your ass.

6362
05:53:50,570 --> 05:53:52,230
We haven't yet?

6363
05:53:52,490 --> 05:53:53,390
They're getting a new tank?

6364
05:53:54,490 --> 05:53:56,350
What happened to the other tank?

6365
05:53:56,610 --> 05:53:57,290
He got kicked?

6366
05:53:58,130 --> 05:54:00,330
What happened to the other tank?

6367
05:54:01,270 --> 05:54:02,210
What happened?

6368
05:54:02,770 --> 05:54:04,250
What happened?

6369
05:54:08,450 --> 05:54:10,470
Oh my god!

6370
05:54:25,120 --> 05:54:25,620
Whoa.

6371
05:54:26,840 --> 05:54:28,400
Guys, what are my lobbies?

6372
05:54:29,620 --> 05:54:33,520
I thought it'd be like fun and happy and dandy like Shroud.

6373
05:54:35,020 --> 05:54:37,120
Is this just a Duel Keeper debuff?

6374
05:54:37,640 --> 05:54:38,460
Like, is it?

6375
05:54:42,880 --> 05:54:43,880
What happened?

6376
05:54:44,940 --> 05:54:47,500
They all seem to have such a great time with Shroud.

6377
05:54:53,020 --> 05:54:55,360
I brought the circus with me.

6378
05:55:07,280 --> 05:55:09,240
I had a feeling they were going to do that.

6379
05:55:09,300 --> 05:55:10,640
That's why I was like really scared.

6380
05:55:11,560 --> 05:55:12,520
I was- whoa!

6381
05:55:17,600 --> 05:55:19,180
I can't see you.

6382
05:55:22,970 --> 05:55:27,330
I legitimately predicted that they were going to...

6383
05:55:29,660 --> 05:55:31,080
Oh, I need heals too.

6384
05:55:41,420 --> 05:55:42,260
I have to reload.

6385
05:55:47,630 --> 05:55:49,290
Bro, I have to reload.

6386
05:55:49,430 --> 05:55:52,070
I can't keep you all up.

6387
05:55:54,170 --> 05:55:55,710
Oh my god.

6388
05:56:00,590 --> 05:56:02,110
Oh my god.

6389
05:56:02,990 --> 05:56:05,010
Hey buddy, I think we're dead.

6390
05:56:08,670 --> 05:56:10,070
Oh.

6391
05:56:10,070 --> 05:56:11,470
Okay.

6392
05:56:17,210 --> 05:56:18,290
Okay.

6393
05:56:19,870 --> 05:56:20,790
Alright.

6394
05:56:25,560 --> 05:56:27,220
Oh my god, he's Grooting.

6395
05:56:32,390 --> 05:56:33,490
He's gonna Groot!

6396
05:56:39,590 --> 05:56:41,010
He's gonna Groot!

6397
05:56:44,350 --> 05:56:45,710
I can't see you.

6398
05:56:51,670 --> 05:56:54,150
Fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear.

6399
05:56:54,250 --> 05:56:58,790
I lived, I lived, I lived, I lived, I lived, I lived.

6400
05:57:00,770 --> 05:57:03,830
I lived, I lived, I-

6401
05:57:08,030 --> 05:57:10,110
I'm a little scared of that.

6402
05:57:13,770 --> 05:57:15,050
I need it.

6403
05:57:18,810 --> 05:57:19,910
Oh my god.

6404
05:57:20,230 --> 05:57:20,550
Please.

6405
05:57:21,550 --> 05:57:22,390
Please.

6406
05:57:23,390 --> 05:57:24,570
Fear, fear.

6407
05:57:26,730 --> 05:57:28,450
Fear, come on, please.

6408
05:57:28,850 --> 05:57:29,270
Please.

6409
05:57:30,190 --> 05:57:31,030
Please!

6410
05:57:31,670 --> 05:57:32,950
Everybody, please!

6411
05:57:40,470 --> 05:57:42,410
I'm so stressed out!

6412
05:57:44,790 --> 05:57:46,870
I'm so stressed!

6413
05:57:47,590 --> 05:57:48,230
Stressed!

6414
05:57:54,450 --> 05:57:55,890
Oh my god.

6415
05:57:56,270 --> 05:57:56,910
Please!

6416
05:58:03,730 --> 05:58:05,590
I'm stressed, guys.

6417
05:58:07,310 --> 05:58:08,590
Heal, heal, heal.

6418
05:58:08,910 --> 05:58:10,850
All I am, I'm just healing.

6419
05:58:11,250 --> 05:58:13,350
That's all I do in my life.

6420
05:58:14,790 --> 05:58:15,430
Fear.

6421
05:58:26,590 --> 05:58:34,730
Oh my god.

6422
05:58:35,190 --> 05:58:36,450
So low.

6423
05:58:38,550 --> 05:58:39,730
I'm so scared.

6424
05:58:40,450 --> 05:58:44,510
This is so stressful, guys.

6425
05:58:44,510 --> 05:58:49,110
I've never been so stressed in a game before.

6426
05:58:51,370 --> 05:58:54,270
I have to do two more minutes of this.

6427
05:58:55,010 --> 05:58:56,750
I love Marvel Rivals.

6428
05:59:02,290 --> 05:59:04,250
Oh my god.

6429
05:59:09,210 --> 05:59:10,510
Fear, fear.

6430
05:59:10,830 --> 05:59:11,230
Okay.

6431
05:59:12,170 --> 05:59:14,390
I can... I feel the fear.

6432
05:59:16,490 --> 05:59:17,430
Three and a half.

6433
05:59:21,850 --> 05:59:22,650
It's fine.

6434
05:59:25,050 --> 05:59:26,970
Clap, clap, clap, clap!

6435
05:59:27,250 --> 05:59:29,110
Clap, clap, clap, clap!

6436
05:59:31,430 --> 05:59:32,290
I'm healing.

6437
05:59:35,210 --> 05:59:35,930
I'm Groot.

6438
05:59:36,090 --> 05:59:37,590
I'm Groot, I'm Groot, I'm Groot, I'm Groot.

6439
05:59:37,670 --> 05:59:38,370
Don't die, please.

6440
05:59:38,590 --> 05:59:39,110
Don't die.

6441
05:59:39,670 --> 05:59:40,330
Please don't die.

6442
05:59:40,330 --> 05:59:40,710
Don't die.

6443
05:59:44,550 --> 05:59:46,090
One more minute of this.

6444
05:59:47,170 --> 05:59:48,630
One more minute of this.

6445
05:59:51,310 --> 05:59:52,750
There's a portal right behind us.

6446
06:00:13,930 --> 06:00:14,970
Updating, updating.

6447
06:00:21,310 --> 06:00:22,210
I thought...

6448
06:00:22,510 --> 06:00:25,430
I legitimately thought... I thought our...

6449
06:00:25,790 --> 06:00:26,570
Oh my god.

6450
06:00:28,350 --> 06:00:30,210
There's like... they're all in front of us here.

6451
06:00:30,370 --> 06:00:31,810
I can't... I can't move.

6452
06:00:33,310 --> 06:00:34,610
Oh, I couldn't.

6453
06:00:35,630 --> 06:00:37,230
They like blocked me.

6454
06:00:41,250 --> 06:00:43,050
I legit... I couldn't move.

6455
06:00:43,130 --> 06:00:44,310
I got fucking...

6456
06:00:45,130 --> 06:00:46,530
If you guys can live, I will.

6457
06:00:52,520 --> 06:00:53,580
Oh my god, please.

6458
06:00:53,880 --> 06:00:54,520
Please.

6459
06:00:54,940 --> 06:00:56,060
Please live.

6460
06:00:57,360 --> 06:00:58,640
Please live!

6461
06:01:00,300 --> 06:01:02,820
Okay, three, two, one.

6462
06:01:04,860 --> 06:01:05,500
Oh

6463
06:01:10,130 --> 06:01:10,970
my god.

6464
06:01:11,590 --> 06:01:12,430
He's Mutant Kiting.

6465
06:01:19,200 --> 06:01:19,740
Please.

6466
06:01:22,200 --> 06:01:23,400
Oh my god, please.

6467
06:01:28,760 --> 06:01:30,400
I froze... I froze Strange.

6468
06:01:33,940 --> 06:01:35,480
There's a... there's clones to my right.

6469
06:01:37,680 --> 06:01:38,980
Tell... tell my last one, last one!

6470
06:01:40,580 --> 06:01:41,980
Oh my god, no!

6471
06:01:49,590 --> 06:01:50,810
You have no supports.

6472
06:01:55,590 --> 06:01:56,330
Please live.

6473
06:02:01,110 --> 06:02:01,990
I will, I will.

6474
06:02:02,090 --> 06:02:02,730
Just play my...

6475
06:02:04,850 --> 06:02:06,350
I'm damage boosting this.

6476
06:02:11,470 --> 06:02:14,230
No, that's just...

6477
06:02:14,230 --> 06:02:15,530
Oh my god!

6478
06:02:16,070 --> 06:02:17,210
Oh my god!

6479
06:02:20,530 --> 06:02:22,370
I won't forget it.

6480
06:02:22,410 --> 06:02:23,790
Thank you for the raid.

6481
06:02:24,450 --> 06:02:26,170
Thank you for the raid.

6482
06:02:27,030 --> 06:02:28,230
Oh my god.

6483
06:02:28,430 --> 06:02:29,310
Thank god.

6484
06:02:30,010 --> 06:02:32,130
I was like, thank you guys.

6485
06:02:33,130 --> 06:02:35,790
That was way too hard than it should have been.

6486
06:02:35,870 --> 06:02:37,730
That was actually...

6487
06:02:39,930 --> 06:02:40,950
Thank you.

6488
06:02:41,410 --> 06:02:42,670
Sorry, kudos for the raid.

6489
06:02:42,750 --> 06:02:43,430
Hello everybody.

6490
06:02:43,690 --> 06:02:45,630
My name is... I'm so stressed out.

6491
06:02:45,750 --> 06:02:48,890
Oh my... that was the most stressful game I've ever played today.

6492
06:02:49,290 --> 06:02:53,190
I've never been so... so hard for a GM.

6493
06:02:53,730 --> 06:02:57,550
They're... they cannot... I don't believe they're GM 3.

6494
06:02:58,010 --> 06:03:00,930
I... that was such a stressful game.

6495
06:03:00,930 --> 06:03:03,410
I've never had... like...

6496
06:03:03,410 --> 06:03:07,590
The top... against the top 10 stack was easier than this.

6497
06:03:07,910 --> 06:03:13,330
It's crazy that the top 10 stack was easier than the fucking GM 3 game.

6498
06:03:13,790 --> 06:03:16,850
That is... that is not GM 3 my fucking ass.

6499
06:03:20,690 --> 06:03:25,990
We were against a GM... we were against two GM 3 players but there's no fucking way.

6500
06:03:26,430 --> 06:03:28,130
There's no fucking way.

6501
06:03:28,190 --> 06:03:29,670
I don't believe it.

6502
06:03:30,330 --> 06:03:33,990
I've never been so stressed out like healing before.

6503
06:03:34,370 --> 06:03:35,610
But hello everybody.

6504
06:03:35,730 --> 06:03:36,650
My name is DonkeyBrain.

6505
06:03:36,970 --> 06:03:38,450
Thank you Zykoona for the raid.

6506
06:03:38,870 --> 06:03:41,430
I usually stream on YouTube so please check me out there.

6507
06:03:41,550 --> 06:03:43,810
But I've been doing my rank grind on Twitch.

6508
06:03:45,050 --> 06:03:47,530
Because I really want to try and end top 500.

6509
06:03:48,230 --> 06:03:51,130
So far I am up 30 points.

6510
06:03:52,250 --> 06:03:53,950
In 5-6 hours.

6511
06:03:54,590 --> 06:03:56,590
So, is that good?

6512
06:03:56,870 --> 06:03:57,850
No, it's not.

6513
06:03:58,850 --> 06:04:00,390
Surefour stop.

6514
06:04:00,590 --> 06:04:02,790
I've had such bad luck today.

6515
06:04:04,370 --> 06:04:08,290
Surefour, I've actually had insane luck.

6516
06:04:08,410 --> 06:04:10,050
Like terrible luck today.

6517
06:04:10,550 --> 06:04:11,650
Please Surefour.

6518
06:04:16,530 --> 06:04:18,930
Surefour ban my Widow.

6519
06:04:19,090 --> 06:04:21,250
We lost Surefour.

6520
06:04:22,350 --> 06:04:25,430
It wasn't the Widow problem.

6521
06:04:29,370 --> 06:04:30,550
Oh my god.

6522
06:04:31,190 --> 06:04:34,070
I was beating the fuck out.

6523
06:04:34,490 --> 06:04:36,310
Look, it wasn't just my fault.

6524
06:04:36,430 --> 06:04:39,150
The other support also banned Widow.

6525
06:04:39,490 --> 06:04:42,030
So you can't put the full blame on me.

6526
06:04:42,270 --> 06:04:45,350
I get at least 50% of that blame.

6527
06:04:50,810 --> 06:04:52,350
Oh my god.

6528
06:04:52,590 --> 06:04:54,790
Oh yeah, so my stack might be depressed.

6529
06:04:55,130 --> 06:04:57,010
And we already had one guy rage quit.

6530
06:04:57,010 --> 06:04:59,810
So, I think it's going alright.

6531
06:05:00,350 --> 06:05:04,190
But I might be the happiest Marble Rivals streamer.

6532
06:05:07,470 --> 06:05:16,490
No, you are not the happiest Marble Rivals streamer.

6533
06:05:21,020 --> 06:05:24,980
I'm ranked 150 right now with like 12 wins today?

6534
06:05:25,100 --> 06:05:26,620
What the fuck happened?

6535
06:05:34,140 --> 06:05:35,100
What happened?

6536
06:05:36,760 --> 06:05:37,720
That's fucked.

6537
06:05:39,340 --> 06:05:41,100
Hey Surefour, you want play later?

6538
06:05:41,240 --> 06:05:42,320
So I can tank that.

6539
06:05:42,780 --> 06:05:44,700
So I can tank it.

6540
06:05:48,120 --> 06:05:50,660
Come on, you don't need all those points.

6541
06:05:52,360 --> 06:05:55,360
You don't need, it's about, if you are like secure in top 500.

6542
06:05:55,780 --> 06:05:57,860
Then it's not fun for your viewers.

6543
06:05:57,860 --> 06:05:59,800
Your viewers want a story.

6544
06:06:01,060 --> 06:06:04,100
If you are safe, then it's not fun to watch.

6545
06:06:11,350 --> 06:06:12,970
Yeah, they want to see a struggle.

6546
06:06:13,230 --> 06:06:14,310
They want to see a journey.

6547
06:06:14,510 --> 06:06:16,050
If you are safe, then there is no journey.

6548
06:06:20,960 --> 06:06:23,180
Like, what are the odds?

6549
06:06:23,580 --> 06:06:26,740
What are the like, that's the word.

6550
06:06:28,120 --> 06:06:28,640
Like...

6551
06:06:30,720 --> 06:06:34,000
Like, you know, but I can't threaten.

6552
06:06:35,320 --> 06:06:39,800
Okay, look, you can threaten the Black Widow pick if we play.

6553
06:06:41,860 --> 06:06:43,580
I'll let you threaten people.

6554
06:06:44,980 --> 06:06:47,520
Like, what's the word for like, you know, there's like no struggle.

6555
06:06:48,020 --> 06:06:52,580
It's not fun to watch a streamer not struggle.

6556
06:06:52,940 --> 06:06:53,740
There's no story.

6557
06:06:54,040 --> 06:06:55,640
There's no character arc in development.

6558
06:06:55,640 --> 06:06:57,020
Yeah, there's no stakes.

6559
06:06:57,200 --> 06:07:00,640
Yeah, there's no stakes involved if you are safe in your ELO.

6560
06:07:02,220 --> 06:07:03,040
It's boring.

6561
06:07:03,520 --> 06:07:05,120
You gotta lose some.

6562
06:07:06,160 --> 06:07:07,400
To make it exciting.

6563
06:07:13,510 --> 06:07:14,330
Oh, man.

6564
06:07:14,590 --> 06:07:16,990
I've heard everybody 4 stacks the top 10, though.

6565
06:07:18,290 --> 06:07:19,850
It's a little rough for the solo queuers.

6566
06:07:30,890 --> 06:07:32,570
Hey, Adam's playable now.

6567
06:07:36,870 --> 06:07:37,890
Damn, that was deep.

6568
06:07:37,890 --> 06:07:40,110
I'm now okay with losing a few.

6569
06:07:49,330 --> 06:07:51,590
See, this is all about the hero's journey.

6570
06:07:51,870 --> 06:07:52,590
It's been planned.

6571
06:07:53,090 --> 06:07:56,570
So, like, the more I struggle, the sweeter the victory.

6572
06:08:04,250 --> 06:08:06,410
So then, like, everybody will find...

6573
06:08:07,450 --> 06:08:11,770
See, if I get top 500 so easily, then, like, what's the point?

6574
06:08:13,010 --> 06:08:13,610
What's the...

6575
06:08:14,250 --> 06:08:15,330
What's the point?

6576
06:08:15,590 --> 06:08:16,650
There was no journey.

6577
06:08:24,200 --> 06:08:24,780
Exactly.

6578
06:08:24,960 --> 06:08:29,260
I'm losing on purpose so we get to have a better video.

6579
06:08:31,980 --> 06:08:36,360
So we get a better video for my channel.

6580
06:08:45,420 --> 06:08:46,420
Where are we going?

6581
06:08:46,800 --> 06:08:47,580
Where are we going?

6582
06:08:47,580 --> 06:08:48,580
Wow!

6583
06:08:52,540 --> 06:08:56,360
The support split would be good.

6584
06:09:06,840 --> 06:09:08,700
I'm scared.

6585
06:09:12,040 --> 06:09:13,320
I'm scared.

6586
06:09:14,560 --> 06:09:17,500
I'm a little scared here.

6587
06:09:22,350 --> 06:09:24,910
Where's my... rest of my team?

6588
06:09:25,010 --> 06:09:25,550
There they are.

6589
06:09:28,870 --> 06:09:30,050
Oh, shit!

6590
06:09:30,130 --> 06:09:30,890
Look at him go!

6591
06:09:34,750 --> 06:09:36,330
Let him go!

6592
06:09:39,950 --> 06:09:41,490
We won that?

6593
06:09:43,930 --> 06:09:44,690
How?

6594
06:09:45,450 --> 06:09:47,930
How the fuck did we win that?

6595
06:09:49,410 --> 06:09:50,170
Yo...

6596
06:09:53,650 --> 06:09:55,630
Oh my god!

6597
06:09:55,630 --> 06:09:57,290
Oh my god!

6598
06:09:57,530 --> 06:09:59,610
Somebody save me!

6599
06:10:05,570 --> 06:10:07,650
What happened?

6600
06:10:09,730 --> 06:10:12,530
Yeah, fuck that clone in particular, though.

6601
06:10:13,210 --> 06:10:15,370
Like, actually, what happened?

6602
06:10:16,130 --> 06:10:17,910
How did I live?

6603
06:10:18,450 --> 06:10:19,370
How?

6604
06:10:19,370 --> 06:10:20,410
How?

6605
06:10:21,450 --> 06:10:23,230
I don't know how this works.

6606
06:10:23,750 --> 06:10:25,150
I don't know.

6607
06:10:26,130 --> 06:10:27,290
How am I alive?

6608
06:10:27,950 --> 06:10:30,170
Like, how am I fucking alive?

6609
06:10:31,730 --> 06:10:33,610
This is called triple support, guys.

6610
06:10:33,710 --> 06:10:34,610
Nobody dies.

6611
06:10:34,850 --> 06:10:35,870
Welcome to new goats.

6612
06:10:39,130 --> 06:10:40,410
Actual new goats.

6613
06:10:43,730 --> 06:10:45,150
Guys, I don't know if I...

6614
06:10:45,150 --> 06:10:45,910
What?

6615
06:10:47,310 --> 06:10:47,750
Whoa!

6616
06:10:48,230 --> 06:10:49,910
They're gonna dance!

6617
06:10:50,330 --> 06:10:52,390
They're gonna dance!

6618
06:10:53,370 --> 06:10:55,270
They're gonna dance!

6619
06:10:58,910 --> 06:11:00,330
Oh, oh.

6620
06:11:00,810 --> 06:11:01,190
I'm okay.

6621
06:11:02,890 --> 06:11:03,590
Stay with me.

6622
06:11:04,030 --> 06:11:06,590
I'm just gonna play with my...

6623
06:11:06,590 --> 06:11:07,490
I'm just gonna...

6624
06:11:07,870 --> 06:11:09,190
I'm gonna play here.

6625
06:11:09,770 --> 06:11:11,130
I'm gonna play here.

6626
06:11:11,310 --> 06:11:13,350
And then I...

6627
06:11:16,670 --> 06:11:17,550
I mean...

6628
06:11:17,550 --> 06:11:19,150
Is my Starlord okay?

6629
06:11:19,350 --> 06:11:19,850
He is.

6630
06:11:21,590 --> 06:11:22,630
I should give him the orb.

6631
06:11:24,410 --> 06:11:24,790
Yay!

6632
06:11:33,050 --> 06:11:34,750
I still don't know how I fucking lived there.

6633
06:11:34,950 --> 06:11:37,210
I legitimately was just like...

6634
06:11:37,730 --> 06:11:39,990
I was like, everything's gonna be okay, guys.

6635
06:11:40,270 --> 06:11:41,610
And then I got TP'd.

6636
06:11:44,310 --> 06:11:45,150
Smooth sailing.

6637
06:11:45,150 --> 06:11:46,510
This is it.

6638
06:11:46,610 --> 06:11:47,910
This is where things turn around.

6639
06:11:47,990 --> 06:11:49,550
This is my hours, guys.

6640
06:11:50,250 --> 06:11:51,330
This is literally my hours.

6641
06:11:51,750 --> 06:11:53,230
This is where I actually start queuing.

6642
06:11:55,590 --> 06:11:57,330
I know why I lose now.

6643
06:11:57,690 --> 06:12:00,330
I play at the fucked up normal hours.

6644
06:12:01,370 --> 06:12:03,110
The jokey hours is where I win.

6645
06:12:04,850 --> 06:12:07,030
This is my element.

6646
06:12:08,330 --> 06:12:12,710
When I grind at 11pm, I recognize the 11pm players.

6647
06:12:17,000 --> 06:12:18,920
I'm in my natural habitat.

6648
06:12:19,160 --> 06:12:19,880
The degeners.

6649
06:12:21,640 --> 06:12:23,760
Exactly, I finished my warmup.

6650
06:12:23,820 --> 06:12:24,340
Exactly.

6651
06:12:24,960 --> 06:12:27,760
I'm finally locked in after 6 hours.

6652
06:12:28,040 --> 06:12:34,440
After I made these pro players lose practically all their rank, I'm locked in.

6653
06:12:35,000 --> 06:12:37,040
Now they have a journey.

6654
06:12:42,100 --> 06:12:44,680
Now they really want to win.

6655
06:12:44,680 --> 06:12:46,180
That's why I did it.

6656
06:12:47,520 --> 06:12:50,800
Because at first, they're not gonna try as hard.

6657
06:12:51,120 --> 06:12:52,640
But now they're desperate.

6658
06:12:57,260 --> 06:13:00,080
Now they want to know what it's like to win again.

6659
06:13:03,420 --> 06:13:07,740
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap.

6660
06:13:11,440 --> 06:13:12,540
Almost forgot about this guy.

6661
06:13:13,390 --> 06:13:14,480
He's too busy clapping.

6662
06:13:16,640 --> 06:13:17,740
Jesus Christ.

6663
06:13:18,440 --> 06:13:19,000
Don't die.

6664
06:13:19,720 --> 06:13:20,780
Please don't die.

6665
06:13:21,840 --> 06:13:23,540
Please don't die.

6666
06:13:26,200 --> 06:13:26,900
Oh.

6667
06:13:27,380 --> 06:13:28,520
That's fine, we're fine, right?

6668
06:13:28,580 --> 06:13:29,040
We're fine, right?

6669
06:13:29,080 --> 06:13:29,540
We're fine, right?

6670
06:13:30,100 --> 06:13:31,060
We're fine.

6671
06:13:32,020 --> 06:13:32,700
Yes.

6672
06:13:36,520 --> 06:13:37,060
How?

6673
06:13:39,800 --> 06:13:40,380
How?

6674
06:13:40,780 --> 06:13:41,260
How?

6675
06:13:44,290 --> 06:13:46,210
How is this still going on?

6676
06:13:46,590 --> 06:13:49,210
How are we still fighting for this one point?

6677
06:13:49,850 --> 06:13:51,370
Oh my god, it's over.

6678
06:13:51,830 --> 06:13:53,090
It's finally over.

6679
06:13:54,370 --> 06:13:56,130
It's actually over.

6680
06:14:00,630 --> 06:14:01,570
Oh my god.

6681
06:14:02,930 --> 06:14:04,570
It's finally over.

6682
06:14:04,810 --> 06:14:05,850
That's crazy.

6683
06:14:07,170 --> 06:14:08,090
It took me so...

6684
06:14:08,090 --> 06:14:10,570
It took like 20 years for this game to end.

6685
06:14:11,910 --> 06:14:12,590
Mate, wait.

6686
06:14:13,050 --> 06:14:13,790
You know what's great?

6687
06:14:14,610 --> 06:14:17,390
Because like, normally they don't play at these hours.

6688
06:14:17,710 --> 06:14:20,130
Which means they don't know who the fuck Korova is.

6689
06:14:20,330 --> 06:14:28,790
Which means Adam will finally be ba- Which means they won't ban Adam because they don't know who he is.

6690
06:14:29,390 --> 06:14:30,790
This is it.

6691
06:14:33,370 --> 06:14:37,050
Because normally, nobody's degenning like me.

6692
06:14:41,380 --> 06:14:44,960
They're not going to open this stream and figure it out.

6693
06:14:45,640 --> 06:14:46,800
That's crazy.

6694
06:14:47,480 --> 06:14:49,460
That's fucking crazy talk.

6695
06:14:52,260 --> 06:14:53,900
Wait, she's cooking.

6696
06:14:55,760 --> 06:14:57,560
Fuck that clone in particular.

6697
06:15:01,900 --> 06:15:03,300
He's won, he's won.

6698
06:15:06,140 --> 06:15:07,380
Fuck these clones.

6699
06:15:08,740 --> 06:15:09,960
It's all coming together.

6700
06:15:10,080 --> 06:15:11,960
You see how nobody's banning Adam?

6701
06:15:12,540 --> 06:15:12,960
Guys?

6702
06:15:13,300 --> 06:15:14,120
You see that?

6703
06:15:15,280 --> 06:15:17,600
Nobody's banning Adam anymore at these hours?

6704
06:15:17,980 --> 06:15:19,780
Because they don't know who the fuck he is.

6705
06:15:19,820 --> 06:15:23,540
Because who plays at these hours except for freaks like me?

6706
06:15:38,180 --> 06:15:39,140
Who's Korova?

6707
06:15:39,140 --> 06:15:44,540
Look, he's the guy in my stack that's like, apparently, he's like the rank 1 Adam.

6708
06:15:46,440 --> 06:15:48,500
Oh my god, just stop!

6709
06:15:56,740 --> 06:16:01,580
He basically, this entire day, has been like, they just target ban Adam.

6710
06:16:01,820 --> 06:16:02,580
Which is crazy.

6711
06:16:04,060 --> 06:16:06,760
They like target, hard target, ban Adam.

6712
06:16:06,840 --> 06:16:09,260
Which is crazy and funny at the same time.

6713
06:16:09,420 --> 06:16:10,360
They're like that scared.

6714
06:16:11,940 --> 06:16:16,380
But like, every time I watch his stream, he gets to play Adam.

6715
06:16:17,660 --> 06:16:19,640
Like, that's so fucked.

6716
06:16:20,120 --> 06:16:20,880
Oh, I need heals.

6717
06:16:24,620 --> 06:16:26,280
I guess I die too.

6718
06:16:31,620 --> 06:16:32,220
Unless...

6719
06:16:33,280 --> 06:16:34,320
That's fine, right?

6720
06:16:37,460 --> 06:16:38,060
Woo!

6721
06:16:38,400 --> 06:16:39,160
Let's go!

6722
06:16:47,170 --> 06:16:48,790
Oh, let's not go.

6723
06:16:48,850 --> 06:16:50,030
Let's go again!

6724
06:16:53,890 --> 06:16:57,590
I was gonna say, alright, time to walk away.

6725
06:17:00,690 --> 06:17:01,250
Wait.

6726
06:17:01,250 --> 06:17:03,990
Oh, I was gonna say, what is the fuck is Strange doing?

6727
06:17:11,010 --> 06:17:12,590
That's okay, they're still healthy.

6728
06:17:12,730 --> 06:17:13,350
We should get the Strange.

6729
06:17:14,210 --> 06:17:14,990
He's frozen?

6730
06:17:19,710 --> 06:17:20,790
Come on, Starlord.

6731
06:17:21,310 --> 06:17:22,270
Oh, I'm not!

6732
06:17:22,430 --> 06:17:22,730
Starlord's up!

6733
06:17:22,930 --> 06:17:23,270
Starlord's up!

6734
06:17:26,230 --> 06:17:26,750
Nice!

6735
06:17:26,830 --> 06:17:27,510
Let's go!

6736
06:17:30,470 --> 06:17:31,270
There you go.

6737
06:17:31,870 --> 06:17:32,470
It's fine.

6738
06:17:32,570 --> 06:17:33,790
Everything is fine.

6739
06:17:39,270 --> 06:17:42,130
That was such a fucking long-ass fight.

6740
06:17:42,490 --> 06:17:43,910
That's actually...

6741
06:17:45,050 --> 06:17:46,970
I hate how easy Luna is to use.

6742
06:17:47,170 --> 06:17:47,330
Yep.

6743
06:17:48,690 --> 06:17:51,010
Luna is the second easiest support character.

6744
06:17:51,230 --> 06:17:52,810
Who's the first Rocky Raccoon?

6745
06:17:53,030 --> 06:17:54,750
Rocky Raccoon is the easiest support.

6746
06:17:56,350 --> 06:18:00,750
But he's also the most hated in high elo, because why the fuck would you ever play Rocky Raccoon?

6747
06:18:07,110 --> 06:18:09,350
We don't talk about Rocky.

6748
06:18:10,830 --> 06:18:12,010
Three supports works.

6749
06:18:13,370 --> 06:18:14,970
Oh my god, we got her peak!

6750
06:18:15,930 --> 06:18:17,650
We fucking did it!

6751
06:18:18,430 --> 06:18:19,610
Oh my god!

6752
06:18:20,710 --> 06:18:21,350
We fucking...

6753
06:18:22,990 --> 06:18:26,890
I don't... I never knew what it was like to get a peak.

6754
06:18:27,190 --> 06:18:28,790
I never knew.

6755
06:18:30,810 --> 06:18:32,110
Sarah, thank you for the Twitch prize.

6756
06:18:32,190 --> 06:18:32,990
Thank you.

6757
06:18:33,110 --> 06:18:34,270
SM, thank you for the Twitch prize.

6758
06:18:34,390 --> 06:18:35,650
Oh my god, can I run an ad?

6759
06:18:36,610 --> 06:18:37,390
Oh my god.

6760
06:18:37,810 --> 06:18:39,170
Guys, I'm gonna run an ad now.

6761
06:18:39,230 --> 06:18:41,090
I'm gonna be a Twitch streamer for today.

6762
06:18:42,390 --> 06:18:43,410
You guys know how...

6763
06:18:43,410 --> 06:18:45,430
You guys know how to not get ads?

6764
06:18:46,230 --> 06:18:48,190
Sorry, the people who got ads can't even...

6765
06:18:49,490 --> 06:18:50,930
I should've said it before.

6766
06:18:51,130 --> 06:18:52,130
Sorry, I'm still learning.

6767
06:18:52,570 --> 06:18:54,290
I should've said it before I ran an ad.

6768
06:18:54,690 --> 06:18:58,010
But like, the people who are subscribed, at least you know.

6769
06:18:58,190 --> 06:18:59,110
But hey guys.

6770
06:18:59,950 --> 06:19:00,750
Hey guys.

6771
06:19:01,370 --> 06:19:03,190
If you don't wanna get ads...

6772
06:19:04,670 --> 06:19:05,470
Just subscribe.

6773
06:19:10,090 --> 06:19:11,890
Wait, oh yeah, I should tell them when it's done.

6774
06:19:12,190 --> 06:19:14,210
Alright, let me know when your ad's done.

6775
06:19:14,510 --> 06:19:17,190
Well, you won't hear this, but like, I'll figure it out.

6776
06:19:19,490 --> 06:19:21,630
SoSharky, thank you for the five gifted subs.

6777
06:19:21,790 --> 06:19:22,890
Thank you, thank you.

6778
06:19:23,310 --> 06:19:25,550
Bro said ads like crazy.

6779
06:19:25,830 --> 06:19:26,630
Oh yeah, anyway.

6780
06:19:26,990 --> 06:19:28,450
I don't... I don't run ads.

6781
06:19:28,590 --> 06:19:29,530
I'm just fucking around.

6782
06:19:30,330 --> 06:19:32,110
But like, I heard that...

6783
06:19:32,110 --> 06:19:35,310
I know that like, some orgs, when you join an org...

6784
06:19:35,310 --> 06:19:37,190
You have to run a mandatory like...

6785
06:19:38,250 --> 06:19:41,910
Around like three to six minute ads per hour or some shit.

6786
06:19:42,190 --> 06:19:44,210
Like, it's like mandatory for the org.

6787
06:19:44,410 --> 06:19:46,190
Because they have like a contract with Twitch.

6788
06:19:46,430 --> 06:19:47,410
And like...

6789
06:19:48,190 --> 06:19:50,110
And it's like something like how...

6790
06:19:50,110 --> 06:19:51,710
That's how like they make money as well.

6791
06:19:51,990 --> 06:19:52,630
So that's why...

6792
06:19:52,630 --> 06:19:54,230
That's why you see a lot of like...

6793
06:19:54,230 --> 06:19:57,050
A lot of like streamers who are in orgs.

6794
06:19:57,130 --> 06:19:58,550
They run ads a lot.

6795
06:19:59,250 --> 06:20:00,610
Just cause like...

6796
06:20:00,610 --> 06:20:03,710
Just cause like, it's like part of their contract with the org itself.

6797
06:20:04,370 --> 06:20:06,050
Trust5, thank you for the five gifted...

6798
06:20:06,050 --> 06:20:07,410
Yeah, I'm leaking company secrets.

6799
06:20:07,610 --> 06:20:08,350
I think that's like a...

6800
06:20:08,350 --> 06:20:09,260
I'm pretty sure the streamers...

6801
06:20:09,870 --> 06:20:10,250
I'm pretty...

6802
06:20:10,250 --> 06:20:12,390
I found that out from the streamers.

6803
06:20:12,430 --> 06:20:13,690
By watching streamers.

6804
06:20:14,650 --> 06:20:15,070
Like...

6805
06:20:17,330 --> 06:20:18,150
Oh my god.

6806
06:20:18,270 --> 06:20:19,810
Leaking company secrets.

6807
06:20:20,030 --> 06:20:21,390
It's like common knowledge.

6808
06:20:24,350 --> 06:20:26,050
Trashfire, thank you for the five gifted subs.

6809
06:20:26,150 --> 06:20:27,090
Thank you, thank you.

6810
06:20:27,670 --> 06:20:29,870
MrBrokenBond, thank you for the five gifted subs.

6811
06:20:30,010 --> 06:20:31,050
Thank you, thank you.

6812
06:20:31,230 --> 06:20:33,730
But yeah, that's why you see a lot of streamers...

6813
06:20:33,730 --> 06:20:35,830
Like, I don't run ads because I don't need to.

6814
06:20:36,510 --> 06:20:37,830
I'm perfectly fine...

6815
06:20:37,830 --> 06:20:39,150
Well off with just...

6816
06:20:39,150 --> 06:20:39,850
Well, I'm not like...

6817
06:20:39,850 --> 06:20:41,010
I'm not a fucking millionaire, guys.

6818
06:20:41,090 --> 06:20:43,490
I know everybody thinks like streamers are millionaires.

6819
06:20:43,550 --> 06:20:44,550
But I live in...

6820
06:20:44,550 --> 06:20:47,770
I live in Canada.

6821
06:20:48,150 --> 06:20:49,370
And like...

6822
06:20:49,370 --> 06:20:50,390
Our rent is not okay.

6823
06:20:50,530 --> 06:20:52,530
Why is there five Groots?

6824
06:20:52,990 --> 06:20:53,790
Or three Groots?

6825
06:20:53,790 --> 06:20:55,870
Why is there more Groots now?

6826
06:20:56,950 --> 06:20:57,410
What are...

6827
06:21:02,910 --> 06:21:03,710
Alright.

6828
06:21:04,130 --> 06:21:06,430
Let me get an angle on this.

6829
06:21:07,470 --> 06:21:08,670
They're building...

6830
06:21:09,070 --> 06:21:10,750
They needed more builders.

6831
06:21:11,570 --> 06:21:12,790
Guys, they...

6832
06:21:12,790 --> 06:21:14,350
They needed more...

6833
06:21:15,550 --> 06:21:16,210
It's...

6834
06:21:16,210 --> 06:21:18,470
They recruited another...

6835
06:21:18,470 --> 06:21:19,270
The Groot...

6836
06:21:19,270 --> 06:21:20,550
It's like...

6837
06:21:23,110 --> 06:21:24,570
No, it's broken.

6838
06:21:27,370 --> 06:21:28,750
Wait, I saw this...

6839
06:21:28,750 --> 06:21:30,290
I saw this video once.

6840
06:21:34,250 --> 06:21:36,230
Guys, I just need a coach.

6841
06:21:38,190 --> 06:21:38,690
No.

6842
06:21:39,050 --> 06:21:40,750
No, Ducky.

6843
06:21:41,250 --> 06:21:42,590
Shut up.

6844
06:21:45,930 --> 06:21:46,770
Ducky.

6845
06:21:47,250 --> 06:21:48,730
Don't let me out.

6846
06:21:49,230 --> 06:21:50,470
Let me out.

6847
06:21:52,250 --> 06:21:53,830
Cutter, Mike.

6848
06:21:54,970 --> 06:21:57,910
One girl, three trees.

6849
06:22:02,770 --> 06:22:03,610
Run.

6850
06:22:03,850 --> 06:22:04,090
Yes.

6851
06:22:04,290 --> 06:22:04,990
I got out.

6852
06:22:05,410 --> 06:22:06,130
Oh my god.

6853
06:22:06,430 --> 06:22:07,830
It was the tree.

6854
06:22:08,510 --> 06:22:09,390
I'm free.

6855
06:22:10,030 --> 06:22:11,170
I'm free.

6856
06:22:11,350 --> 06:22:12,950
I wish the human torches...

6857
06:22:12,950 --> 06:22:15,090
I wish you could play the human torch now.

6858
06:22:15,110 --> 06:22:19,110
So I can just start burning the house down.

6859
06:22:20,890 --> 06:22:22,110
Run the ads.

6860
06:22:22,290 --> 06:22:23,570
Someone run the ads.

6861
06:22:23,690 --> 06:22:23,990
Quick.

6862
06:22:31,670 --> 06:22:32,870
Let's go.

6863
06:22:35,090 --> 06:22:36,150
Let's go.

6864
06:22:43,770 --> 06:22:44,470
Okay.

6865
06:22:45,510 --> 06:22:47,750
He got us.

6866
06:22:48,130 --> 06:22:50,250
He brought us out.

6867
06:22:54,670 --> 06:22:56,170
I'm sorry.

6868
06:22:58,050 --> 06:23:01,330
Oh my god.

6869
06:23:01,750 --> 06:23:02,150
No.

6870
06:23:02,790 --> 06:23:05,410
19 inches of venom.

6871
06:23:06,830 --> 06:23:08,250
I'm okay.

6872
06:23:09,670 --> 06:23:10,810
I'm okay.

6873
06:23:11,870 --> 06:23:12,990
Oh my god.

6874
06:23:13,050 --> 06:23:13,870
They're fighting.

6875
06:23:14,290 --> 06:23:15,630
They're fighting.

6876
06:23:17,030 --> 06:23:18,430
What happened?

6877
06:23:19,230 --> 06:23:20,510
What happened?

6878
06:23:20,730 --> 06:23:22,030
They broke the house.

6879
06:23:23,810 --> 06:23:25,270
That timing.

6880
06:23:27,730 --> 06:23:28,790
Oh my god.

6881
06:23:28,830 --> 06:23:29,350
Who would win?

6882
06:23:29,410 --> 06:23:30,730
A big fucking tree?

6883
06:23:31,430 --> 06:23:32,030
Or what?

6884
06:23:32,430 --> 06:23:33,710
Or one Canadian?

6885
06:23:36,410 --> 06:23:38,870
You know about lumberjacks in Canada?

6886
06:23:39,870 --> 06:23:42,770
You know about the lumberjacks in Canada?

6887
06:23:43,190 --> 06:23:45,050
Okay, my favorite...

6888
06:23:45,050 --> 06:23:48,370
Okay, I've been obsessed with Marvel rival memes.

6889
06:23:49,070 --> 06:23:50,530
And we got our ads.

6890
06:23:51,010 --> 06:23:56,890
And one of my favorite Marvel rival memes is the Wolverine TikToks.

6891
06:23:57,030 --> 06:23:58,770
I mean, I don't look at them on TikTok.

6892
06:23:58,950 --> 06:24:00,710
I see them on my Twitter feed.

6893
06:24:01,110 --> 06:24:04,870
But the one that was the animal music.

6894
06:24:06,570 --> 06:24:07,450
Yeah, Leo!

6895
06:24:07,670 --> 06:24:08,010
I love...

6896
06:24:08,410 --> 06:24:09,770
Wait, I'll send you the video.

6897
06:24:09,930 --> 06:24:10,910
I fucking...

6898
06:24:10,910 --> 06:24:13,470
I love this video so much.

6899
06:24:14,130 --> 06:24:19,530
This is legitimately one of my favorite memes from Marvel rivals.

6900
06:24:20,250 --> 06:24:21,350
Wait, is this the right link?

6901
06:24:21,870 --> 06:24:24,350
Oh, it'd be awkward if I give you guys the wrong link, right?

6902
06:24:25,590 --> 06:24:26,570
Okay, this one.

6903
06:24:26,690 --> 06:24:28,090
This is one of my favorite.

6904
06:24:28,390 --> 06:24:30,390
I'm gonna rewatch it because I love it so much.

6905
06:24:33,090 --> 06:24:34,450
I'll watch with you guys.

6906
06:24:34,450 --> 06:24:36,430
I'm not gonna show it on stream.

6907
06:24:47,980 --> 06:24:50,300
I fucking love that video.

6908
06:24:56,600 --> 06:24:57,840
It's such a...

6909
06:24:58,340 --> 06:24:59,460
I love those memes.

6910
06:25:00,960 --> 06:25:03,280
This is why I play Wolverine.

6911
06:25:11,650 --> 06:25:12,850
Oh my god, fight!

6912
06:25:13,110 --> 06:25:13,510
Fight!

6913
06:25:13,870 --> 06:25:14,470
Fight!

6914
06:25:18,100 --> 06:25:19,420
Where did they go?

6915
06:25:20,740 --> 06:25:21,700
Where did they go?

6916
06:25:22,260 --> 06:25:23,560
What did I just witness?

6917
06:25:24,900 --> 06:25:25,500
Therapy.

6918
06:25:27,100 --> 06:25:29,680
This is how pro players cope with each other.

6919
06:25:30,660 --> 06:25:32,900
This is how they survive the harsh world.

6920
06:25:35,920 --> 06:25:38,560
They're letting out their frustrations on each other.

6921
06:25:39,140 --> 06:25:41,820
So it doesn't implode within themselves.

6922
06:25:41,820 --> 06:25:44,400
Because they don't know how to talk about their feelings.

6923
06:25:46,260 --> 06:25:49,260
Guys, you gotta learn how to talk about your feelings, guys.

6924
06:25:51,480 --> 06:25:52,360
They're bonding.

6925
06:25:56,710 --> 06:25:57,990
They just... Oh no.

6926
06:25:58,490 --> 06:25:59,250
Oh no.

6927
06:26:01,690 --> 06:26:02,990
But yeah, that's how they do it.

6928
06:26:03,730 --> 06:26:06,210
Oh, you wanna be... Okay, here's what I would do.

6929
06:26:10,200 --> 06:26:11,140
Wait, where are they?

6930
06:26:11,960 --> 06:26:13,340
I need them to drop down.

6931
06:26:14,040 --> 06:26:14,860
I need...

6932
06:26:16,880 --> 06:26:19,080
I need them to group up.

6933
06:26:21,240 --> 06:26:23,420
I just need them to group up together.

6934
06:26:25,200 --> 06:26:27,120
And then I can do it.

6935
06:26:31,100 --> 06:26:32,140
Wait, wait, not me!

6936
06:26:32,160 --> 06:26:32,740
Not me though!

6937
06:26:33,160 --> 06:26:33,860
No, no, no, no!

6938
06:26:34,000 --> 06:26:35,120
I'm just a little guy!

6939
06:26:35,440 --> 06:26:36,560
I'm just a little...

6940
06:26:38,940 --> 06:26:39,380
No!

6941
06:26:43,640 --> 06:26:44,900
Okay, there we go.

6942
06:26:45,700 --> 06:26:46,520
Oh my god.

6943
06:26:46,840 --> 06:26:47,420
Oh my god.

6944
06:26:47,520 --> 06:26:47,800
No!

6945
06:26:48,000 --> 06:26:48,780
They're waking him up!

6946
06:26:49,020 --> 06:26:49,760
They're waking him up!

6947
06:26:49,940 --> 06:26:50,980
What do I do?!

6948
06:26:50,980 --> 06:26:52,040
They're waking him up!

6949
06:26:52,260 --> 06:26:53,260
They're waking him up!

6950
06:26:56,980 --> 06:26:57,480
No!

6951
06:26:57,740 --> 06:26:58,240
No!

6952
06:26:58,460 --> 06:26:59,180
Not me!

6953
06:26:59,480 --> 06:26:59,780
No!

6954
06:26:59,980 --> 06:27:01,000
Don't awoo me!

6955
06:27:05,360 --> 06:27:06,360
Wake up.

6956
06:27:09,760 --> 06:27:10,880
There we go.

6957
06:27:12,580 --> 06:27:14,620
Oh, he almost got...

6958
06:27:15,400 --> 06:27:16,120
Oh no.

6959
06:27:16,280 --> 06:27:16,840
Oh no.

6960
06:27:17,020 --> 06:27:17,620
Oh no.

6961
06:27:17,880 --> 06:27:18,160
No!

6962
06:27:18,520 --> 06:27:18,700
No!

6963
06:27:19,100 --> 06:27:19,420
No!

6964
06:27:19,680 --> 06:27:20,340
Oh my god.

6965
06:27:20,700 --> 06:27:21,040
No!

6966
06:27:23,000 --> 06:27:24,660
Who keeps waking him up?!

6967
06:27:24,660 --> 06:27:25,760
Who keeps waking him up?!

6968
06:27:25,760 --> 06:27:27,140
Who keeps waking him up?!

6969
06:27:27,140 --> 06:27:29,200
Who keeps waking him up?!

6970
06:27:29,200 --> 06:27:32,340
Who keeps waking him up?!

6971
06:27:32,800 --> 06:27:34,340
Oh my god.

6972
06:27:35,140 --> 06:27:37,280
If I hit the floor eventually...

6973
06:27:38,300 --> 06:27:38,820
Eventually...

6974
06:27:38,820 --> 06:27:41,200
If I hit the floor...

6975
06:27:41,200 --> 06:27:42,720
Oh my god!

6976
06:27:43,280 --> 06:27:43,720
No!

6977
06:27:44,920 --> 06:27:45,320
No!

6978
06:27:46,260 --> 06:27:46,660
No!

6979
06:27:52,240 --> 06:27:53,040
Oh!

6980
06:27:58,160 --> 06:28:01,580
I can't handle the awoos.

6981
06:28:01,880 --> 06:28:04,960
You see, these are the normal queues people tend to get.

6982
06:28:09,280 --> 06:28:10,760
That's fucking right.

6983
06:28:10,760 --> 06:28:12,240
That's right.

6984
06:28:12,620 --> 06:28:12,620
Sleep!

6985
06:28:19,060 --> 06:28:19,860
What?!

6986
06:28:19,860 --> 06:28:22,180
You can get me in spawn?!

6987
06:28:22,180 --> 06:28:24,400
That should be illegal!

6988
06:28:28,100 --> 06:28:29,560
Maybe just...

6989
06:28:29,560 --> 06:28:30,220
Just fine.

6990
06:28:30,300 --> 06:28:31,080
I don't die.

6991
06:28:31,500 --> 06:28:32,600
I don't...

6992
06:28:32,600 --> 06:28:33,100
No!

6993
06:28:35,020 --> 06:28:37,140
Get me out of here!

6994
06:28:40,040 --> 06:28:40,540
No!

6995
06:28:40,540 --> 06:28:41,370
Okay, but what if I...

6996
06:28:41,840 --> 06:28:42,640
There we go.

6997
06:28:43,060 --> 06:28:43,860
There we go.

6998
06:28:45,100 --> 06:28:45,700
How do I parry?

6999
06:28:46,220 --> 06:28:47,660
I've never done this before.

7000
06:28:48,680 --> 06:28:50,200
Oh my god, how do I parry?

7001
06:28:50,500 --> 06:28:51,800
Please get me out of here!

7002
06:28:52,220 --> 06:28:53,140
Get me out of here!

7003
06:28:53,640 --> 06:28:55,260
Get me out of here!

7004
06:28:56,660 --> 06:28:57,160
No!

7005
06:28:58,140 --> 06:28:58,640
Please!

7006
06:28:59,060 --> 06:29:00,140
This is a hatecraft!

7007
06:29:03,000 --> 06:29:03,640
There we go.

7008
06:29:03,640 --> 06:29:04,940
Oh, you can't sleep me.

7009
06:29:05,020 --> 06:29:05,520
I'm in spawn.

7010
06:29:05,680 --> 06:29:06,340
I know that.

7011
06:29:06,780 --> 06:29:08,180
You don't know that.

7012
06:29:08,280 --> 06:29:08,820
I do.

7013
06:29:10,740 --> 06:29:11,640
There we go.

7014
06:29:12,640 --> 06:29:14,100
The awoo haunts me.

7015
06:29:14,560 --> 06:29:17,540
Wait, what?

7016
06:29:19,640 --> 06:29:20,660
Does he know where I am?

7017
06:29:23,320 --> 06:29:24,280
You idiot.

7018
06:29:26,140 --> 06:29:27,520
And you're a pro player?

7019
06:29:27,520 --> 06:29:27,720
You're a pro player?

7020
06:29:31,500 --> 06:29:33,680
Oh no, he's gonna actually kill me now.

7021
06:29:33,960 --> 06:29:37,200
He's gonna actually kill me after I said that.

7022
06:29:37,680 --> 06:29:38,560
So he doesn't know.

7023
06:29:39,380 --> 06:29:41,240
Is he gonna rewatch this part of the VOD?

7024
06:29:47,100 --> 06:29:49,400
Oh, you can't eat people in spawn!

7025
06:29:50,340 --> 06:29:51,480
That's fucking right.

7026
06:29:52,020 --> 06:29:53,320
As it should be.

7027
06:29:55,780 --> 06:29:57,200
As it should be.

7028
06:29:57,960 --> 06:29:58,740
I'm Jeff.

7029
06:30:08,480 --> 06:30:09,980
They won't know.

7030
06:30:10,480 --> 06:30:12,540
They won't know I'm right here.

7031
06:30:13,360 --> 06:30:14,240
What are they gonna do?

7032
06:30:14,300 --> 06:30:15,940
Open my stream and find out?

7033
06:30:17,040 --> 06:30:17,860
No way.

7034
06:30:19,480 --> 06:30:21,020
What are they gonna fucking do?

7035
06:30:21,020 --> 06:30:21,460
Huh?

7036
06:30:22,580 --> 06:30:23,400
What are they gonna do?

7037
06:30:24,320 --> 06:30:26,600
Exactly open this part of the stream?

7038
06:30:26,980 --> 06:30:29,400
And then just...

7039
06:30:29,400 --> 06:30:31,000
Oh, that's fucked.

7040
06:30:31,820 --> 06:30:32,080
No.

7041
06:30:32,360 --> 06:30:32,700
No.

7042
06:30:32,960 --> 06:30:33,280
No!

7043
06:30:36,180 --> 06:30:37,900
Let me eat!

7044
06:30:39,500 --> 06:30:39,820
No!

7045
06:30:43,610 --> 06:30:44,770
My arm!

7046
06:30:45,810 --> 06:30:46,450
It's okay.

7047
06:30:47,070 --> 06:30:48,070
There's still this one.

7048
06:30:48,070 --> 06:30:48,910
There's this one.

7049
06:30:48,970 --> 06:30:49,830
I can get it.

7050
06:30:50,490 --> 06:30:51,490
I got it.

7051
06:30:52,950 --> 06:30:54,370
I got it.

7052
06:30:56,030 --> 06:30:57,050
Where am I?

7053
06:30:57,350 --> 06:30:58,190
Where could I be?

7054
06:31:01,390 --> 06:31:02,250
That's right.

7055
06:31:03,050 --> 06:31:04,530
Oh, that's fucking right.

7056
06:31:04,590 --> 06:31:05,690
What you gonna do?

7057
06:31:08,830 --> 06:31:09,950
That's fucking right.

7058
06:31:10,370 --> 06:31:10,430
Ah!

7059
06:31:11,590 --> 06:31:12,390
It's fine.

7060
06:31:13,330 --> 06:31:15,490
I got the other guy.

7061
06:31:18,070 --> 06:31:20,290
Da da da da da da da da da da.

7062
06:31:21,310 --> 06:31:21,650
Alright.

7063
06:31:23,750 --> 06:31:24,090
What?

7064
06:31:25,070 --> 06:31:26,050
What happened?

7065
06:31:28,150 --> 06:31:29,270
What happened?

7066
06:31:31,310 --> 06:31:33,110
Wait, did I...

7067
06:31:34,490 --> 06:31:35,170
No!

7068
06:31:35,710 --> 06:31:36,810
Oh my god!

7069
06:31:37,070 --> 06:31:37,390
What?

7070
06:31:39,390 --> 06:31:40,810
No, that's so fucked.

7071
06:31:42,430 --> 06:31:43,350
I'm okay!

7072
06:31:43,690 --> 06:31:44,450
I'm okay!

7073
06:31:44,450 --> 06:31:44,530
I'm okay!

7074
06:31:49,550 --> 06:31:50,930
They don't know.

7075
06:31:51,490 --> 06:31:52,950
They don't know.

7076
06:31:55,830 --> 06:31:58,070
Please, I can swim faster than this.

7077
06:31:58,590 --> 06:32:00,330
I can keep swimming.

7078
06:32:00,690 --> 06:32:03,050
Wait, they can't get me if I'm under.

7079
06:32:04,250 --> 06:32:05,450
Wait, that's crazy.

7080
06:32:05,750 --> 06:32:06,710
That's a new tech.

7081
06:32:08,450 --> 06:32:09,490
I didn't know that.

7082
06:32:10,350 --> 06:32:12,090
They can't get me if I'm swimming.

7083
06:32:14,450 --> 06:32:15,030
Get it out.

7084
06:32:15,170 --> 06:32:15,590
Watch.

7085
06:32:17,590 --> 06:32:19,210
Sorry, I fell down.

7086
06:32:21,670 --> 06:32:22,050
No!

7087
06:32:26,130 --> 06:32:28,370
Then how come they couldn't get me there?

7088
06:32:32,930 --> 06:32:34,530
Oh no, they did it after.

7089
06:32:38,270 --> 06:32:39,310
Wait, who did I...

7090
06:32:39,310 --> 06:32:40,570
Oh shit, I got...

7091
06:32:41,370 --> 06:32:42,270
That's not him.

7092
06:32:43,310 --> 06:32:44,230
There we go.

7093
06:32:44,850 --> 06:32:46,870
This is the actual Q time.

7094
06:32:48,110 --> 06:32:49,170
What are you gonna do, huh?

7095
06:32:49,850 --> 06:32:50,910
What are you gonna do?

7096
06:33:00,610 --> 06:33:02,330
That's what they're gonna do.

7097
06:33:03,290 --> 06:33:03,930
That's...

7098
06:33:03,930 --> 06:33:05,550
What did I do?

7099
06:33:07,370 --> 06:33:12,010
I hit one guy and now I'm the bad guy.

7100
06:33:12,010 --> 06:33:14,990
I hit one guy.

7101
06:33:15,450 --> 06:33:20,530
You commit one murder and now suddenly everybody says you're evil.

7102
06:33:25,730 --> 06:33:28,510
My simulated environment is ready.

7103
06:33:29,090 --> 06:33:30,230
Oh, is this baseball?

7104
06:33:32,370 --> 06:33:33,950
Wait a minute.

7105
06:33:34,410 --> 06:33:35,770
Wait a minute.

7106
06:33:36,590 --> 06:33:37,510
Missed.

7107
06:33:37,770 --> 06:33:38,790
That's fucking right.

7108
06:33:40,190 --> 06:33:41,350
Get better aim.

7109
06:33:44,250 --> 06:33:45,270
That's fucking right.

7110
06:33:47,790 --> 06:33:48,450
Where am I?

7111
06:33:48,490 --> 06:33:49,370
I wanna get on the bridge.

7112
06:33:51,770 --> 06:33:52,790
Wait, how do I...

7113
06:33:53,710 --> 06:33:54,050
Alright.

7114
06:33:54,990 --> 06:33:55,550
Where is he?

7115
06:34:00,690 --> 06:34:01,710
That's right, get over here.

7116
06:34:02,170 --> 06:34:02,650
Get over here.

7117
06:34:04,030 --> 06:34:05,390
Oh, you wanna fucking run?

7118
06:34:05,390 --> 06:34:07,970
That's... Oh wait, that's legal.

7119
06:34:09,790 --> 06:34:10,810
That's legal.

7120
06:34:12,310 --> 06:34:14,230
Hulk sends his regards.

7121
06:34:14,690 --> 06:34:17,490
Holy shit, this queue time is crazy.

7122
06:34:19,210 --> 06:34:21,090
I know like that's usually how...

7123
06:34:21,090 --> 06:34:26,290
I heard like some pro players queue for like two hours before they get a game in top 10.

7124
06:34:27,130 --> 06:34:28,330
That's actually insane.

7125
06:34:28,990 --> 06:34:30,730
I don't know if I could live like that.

7126
06:34:32,930 --> 06:34:33,470
Yeah.

7127
06:34:36,430 --> 06:34:37,310
No, it's...

7128
06:34:37,310 --> 06:34:39,870
Yeah, I heard like some pro players...

7129
06:34:41,150 --> 06:34:44,390
Some pro players have to wait two hours for games sometimes.

7130
06:34:44,930 --> 06:34:46,390
Don't, don't please.

7131
06:34:46,490 --> 06:34:47,690
I'm just a little guy.

7132
06:34:49,650 --> 06:34:50,590
Oh, they...

7133
06:34:50,590 --> 06:34:51,510
It's bugged?

7134
06:34:51,750 --> 06:34:52,010
Alright.

7135
06:34:52,470 --> 06:34:53,030
Who knows?

7136
06:34:55,190 --> 06:34:58,410
We have to wait another...

7137
06:34:58,410 --> 06:34:58,730
Woah!

7138
06:34:58,730 --> 06:34:59,470
Woah!

7139
06:35:00,550 --> 06:35:01,190
Aha!

7140
06:35:02,370 --> 06:35:06,230
Alright, if we wait another five minutes, I'm pulling up a second game.

7141
06:35:07,950 --> 06:35:09,770
I'm pulling up...

7142
06:35:09,770 --> 06:35:12,030
I'm pulling up a second game.

7143
06:35:13,410 --> 06:35:17,950
You know like, we're doing the Overwatch special where...

7144
06:35:18,730 --> 06:35:24,710
where like Overwatch streamers pull out a second game just to pass the time.

7145
06:35:25,890 --> 06:35:30,310
Or like, watch YouTube videos, but we're not gonna watch YouTube videos.

7146
06:35:30,630 --> 06:35:32,390
We'll just pull up a second game.

7147
06:35:33,550 --> 06:35:36,350
No one played Bolatro on stream though.

7148
06:35:36,830 --> 06:35:39,430
I wanna watch Bolatro on stream.

7149
06:35:40,070 --> 06:35:41,630
Do I not outlive this?

7150
06:35:42,990 --> 06:35:44,650
I thought I outlived this.

7151
06:35:45,550 --> 06:35:47,250
I wanna play that like on YouTube.

7152
06:35:48,410 --> 06:35:49,490
That's fucking right.

7153
06:35:49,570 --> 06:35:50,590
I live these.

7154
06:35:50,990 --> 06:35:52,090
I live these.

7155
06:35:52,090 --> 06:35:53,070
That's fucking right.

7156
06:35:53,270 --> 06:35:56,330
If I get like 20 bubbles, I'll live these.

7157
06:35:59,070 --> 06:36:00,030
Wait, wait, wait.

7158
06:36:00,090 --> 06:36:00,690
I don't live these.

7159
06:36:00,770 --> 06:36:01,330
I don't live these.

7160
06:36:05,530 --> 06:36:05,930
Nevermind.

7161
06:36:08,270 --> 06:36:09,810
Oh, I could play Holocure.

7162
06:36:10,970 --> 06:36:11,650
That's true.

7163
06:36:12,090 --> 06:36:14,990
I don't know if I wanna do a new update for...

7164
06:36:14,990 --> 06:36:16,930
I don't know.

7165
06:36:17,010 --> 06:36:17,810
I don't know what to play.

7166
06:36:17,810 --> 06:36:17,870
Okay.

7167
06:36:20,230 --> 06:36:21,890
That was good.

7168
06:36:22,570 --> 06:36:23,230
Alright.

7169
06:36:24,210 --> 06:36:25,110
What do we play?

7170
06:36:25,610 --> 06:36:27,970
If it hits five minutes...

7171
06:36:29,710 --> 06:36:33,990
If it hits five minutes and we still don't get a...

7172
06:36:33,990 --> 06:36:35,810
and we still don't...

7173
06:36:37,390 --> 06:36:38,050
No!

7174
06:36:40,050 --> 06:36:41,230
We did it!

7175
06:36:41,270 --> 06:36:42,390
We found a game!

7176
06:36:45,170 --> 06:36:45,730
We found a game!

7177
06:36:45,730 --> 06:36:46,170
Oh, I heard people.

7178
06:36:46,310 --> 06:36:47,930
Yep, I haven't played Blooms.

7179
06:36:48,070 --> 06:36:49,190
Oh, are they still queuing?

7180
06:36:49,630 --> 06:36:50,510
There's AC Killer.

7181
06:36:58,860 --> 06:37:00,900
I never played Bellatro.

7182
06:37:01,040 --> 06:37:03,300
I wanna play it on YouTube.

7183
06:37:04,020 --> 06:37:05,480
Because it's like my first game.

7184
06:37:07,380 --> 06:37:07,960
We did it.

7185
06:37:15,070 --> 06:37:16,690
Get my ass back there.

7186
06:37:17,570 --> 06:37:20,450
Doom you hard tilted mace.

7187
06:37:20,450 --> 06:37:23,410
He had to walk away.

7188
06:37:31,190 --> 06:37:32,510
Damn.

7189
06:37:36,350 --> 06:37:37,530
That's rough.

7190
06:37:42,390 --> 06:37:45,610
You think he touched grass after?

7191
06:37:46,230 --> 06:37:49,230
You think?

7192
06:37:49,230 --> 06:37:50,950
Oh my god.

7193
06:37:56,560 --> 06:38:01,220
You think he actually like went out and got some fresh air after that?

7194
06:38:02,200 --> 06:38:04,180
Bro, he was saying some fucked up shit.

7195
06:38:04,540 --> 06:38:08,460
Apparently he was saying some shit in Korean.

7196
06:38:08,980 --> 06:38:10,180
He was so tilted.

7197
06:38:10,460 --> 06:38:14,620
He like literally started saying shit in a different language.

7198
06:38:24,890 --> 06:38:26,770
That was how tilted he was.

7199
06:38:29,170 --> 06:38:37,650
Apparently it was really bad to the point where when the stack Gomez, one of the people in my stack was like, don't translate that.

7200
06:38:38,870 --> 06:38:42,750
Don't translate that.

7201
06:38:54,070 --> 06:38:55,150
Can't be that bad.

7202
06:38:55,390 --> 06:38:56,810
Oh, it could be that bad.

7203
06:38:56,810 --> 06:38:59,210
If at one point they were like, don't translate it.

7204
06:38:59,390 --> 06:39:00,810
I think it might have been really bad.

7205
06:39:01,370 --> 06:39:02,190
I don't know.

7206
06:39:02,610 --> 06:39:03,750
Just a maybe.

7207
06:39:12,750 --> 06:39:13,230
Alright.

7208
06:39:18,570 --> 06:39:20,110
Everything will be okay.

7209
06:39:23,110 --> 06:39:24,630
I don't know if it will be.

7210
06:39:24,630 --> 06:39:28,370
But like, you know, sometimes you gotta be hopeful in this fucked up world.

7211
06:39:31,790 --> 06:39:34,430
I'm worried about going in.

7212
06:39:34,610 --> 06:39:35,130
Oh.

7213
06:39:42,160 --> 06:39:47,620
Oh my god.

7214
06:39:48,020 --> 06:39:48,600
Like, okay.

7215
06:39:51,180 --> 06:39:52,780
I'm like, what do I do?

7216
06:39:53,300 --> 06:39:55,540
What do I do?

7217
06:39:55,540 --> 06:39:57,120
What the fuck?

7218
06:39:57,940 --> 06:39:58,120
What?

7219
06:40:02,240 --> 06:40:04,260
I literally didn't know what to do there.

7220
06:40:04,420 --> 06:40:05,240
I was like, okay.

7221
06:40:05,340 --> 06:40:06,700
There's a Psylocke here.

7222
06:40:08,140 --> 06:40:09,380
What do I do?

7223
06:40:12,200 --> 06:40:13,860
I knew I was gonna die regardless.

7224
06:40:14,080 --> 06:40:20,700
As I stay in spawn and like, I guess like my team's just like, I guess die.

7225
06:40:22,500 --> 06:40:26,580
It was like, you die, you die, you don't, you die, you do.

7226
06:40:27,080 --> 06:40:27,500
Scenario.

7227
06:40:30,940 --> 06:40:31,860
Oh, I need heals here.

7228
06:40:34,300 --> 06:40:35,200
Thank you.

7229
06:40:40,050 --> 06:40:40,890
Let's go!

7230
06:40:43,830 --> 06:40:44,670
I'm a little worried.

7231
06:40:49,550 --> 06:40:50,970
I'm just a little worried.

7232
06:40:53,150 --> 06:40:54,490
Just a little bit.

7233
06:40:55,230 --> 06:40:55,510
Whoa!

7234
06:40:56,450 --> 06:40:56,930
Whoa!

7235
06:41:01,390 --> 06:41:03,590
I was like, yeah, I'm a little worried.

7236
06:41:03,830 --> 06:41:05,670
And then I'm like, oh, there he is.

7237
06:41:07,750 --> 06:41:09,130
Yeah, that Hawkeye's scary.

7238
06:41:09,970 --> 06:41:10,950
He's a little scary.

7239
06:41:14,250 --> 06:41:16,570
They're just saying all the frustration.

7240
06:41:18,230 --> 06:41:20,290
I do that to a lot of people.

7241
06:41:25,850 --> 06:41:27,930
Yeah, that seemed about right.

7242
06:41:33,280 --> 06:41:34,280
Oh!

7243
06:41:37,640 --> 06:41:38,140
Whoa!

7244
06:41:38,820 --> 06:41:39,600
What happened?

7245
06:41:44,880 --> 06:41:46,220
Oh, alright.

7246
06:41:47,260 --> 06:41:48,420
Let's go!

7247
06:41:51,240 --> 06:41:52,260
Let's go!

7248
06:41:53,420 --> 06:41:54,480
You got your heals!

7249
06:41:58,010 --> 06:41:59,910
Wait, is he going Jeff?

7250
06:42:00,270 --> 06:42:01,130
Oh no.

7251
06:42:01,130 --> 06:42:01,370
Oh no.

7252
06:42:01,830 --> 06:42:04,270
I'm sorry to keep banning your Adam.

7253
06:42:04,510 --> 06:42:05,610
I'm so sorry.

7254
06:42:06,770 --> 06:42:08,490
I'm so sorry.

7255
06:42:19,210 --> 06:42:20,330
I'm scared.

7256
06:42:24,660 --> 06:42:25,760
I'm scared.

7257
06:42:25,960 --> 06:42:27,480
He said he's never gonna miss.

7258
06:42:30,940 --> 06:42:32,400
No, I have to reload.

7259
06:42:33,400 --> 06:42:34,920
I have to reload.

7260
06:42:39,360 --> 06:42:40,260
Yay!

7261
06:42:40,900 --> 06:42:42,160
Oh shit, sorry!

7262
06:42:45,000 --> 06:42:46,020
Whoops.

7263
06:42:46,440 --> 06:42:48,080
I forgot to heal this guy.

7264
06:42:50,240 --> 06:42:51,260
Um...

7265
06:42:52,700 --> 06:42:53,720
Um...

7266
06:42:57,450 --> 06:42:58,460
Jesus Christ.

7267
06:43:01,740 --> 06:43:03,000
Guys, don't worry.

7268
06:43:03,660 --> 06:43:05,540
Guys, he's...

7269
06:43:06,100 --> 06:43:07,540
I'm a little...

7270
06:43:11,800 --> 06:43:12,800
Fuck!

7271
06:43:13,180 --> 06:43:13,900
Okay!

7272
06:43:17,020 --> 06:43:18,580
Wait, this is last fight.

7273
06:43:20,740 --> 06:43:21,120
Okay.

7274
06:43:21,940 --> 06:43:22,880
Alright, fear.

7275
06:43:27,840 --> 06:43:28,600
Guys.

7276
06:43:33,300 --> 06:43:34,580
We can forehold this.

7277
06:43:34,780 --> 06:43:35,360
I believe.

7278
06:43:39,380 --> 06:43:42,500
That was like...

7279
06:43:42,500 --> 06:43:43,700
That was a whale.

7280
06:43:43,700 --> 06:43:46,300
And I'm also scared about that.

7281
06:43:46,360 --> 06:43:47,860
That is rough!

7282
06:43:54,790 --> 06:43:56,790
That's the worst part about these queues.

7283
06:43:56,990 --> 06:43:58,610
You wait so long just to lose.

7284
06:43:58,690 --> 06:44:00,050
It fucking sucks.

7285
06:44:02,450 --> 06:44:03,710
Alright, let me...

7286
06:44:03,710 --> 06:44:05,410
Let me look at Steam.

7287
06:44:05,770 --> 06:44:07,410
What can we play as a second game?

7288
06:44:07,550 --> 06:44:10,310
If these queues go longer than...

7289
06:44:10,310 --> 06:44:13,290
If these queues are like...

7290
06:44:13,290 --> 06:44:14,270
Um...

7291
06:44:14,270 --> 06:44:15,470
What's the word?

7292
06:44:16,110 --> 06:44:17,950
If they're like...

7293
06:44:17,950 --> 06:44:19,830
6 plus...10 minutes long?

7294
06:44:19,930 --> 06:44:21,650
I'm fucking pulling up a second game.

7295
06:44:22,150 --> 06:44:25,390
The second time I open up the queue and there's 10 minutes long...

7296
06:44:25,390 --> 06:44:27,110
We're opening a secondary game.

7297
06:44:27,150 --> 06:44:28,710
We're going fucking Overwatch style.

7298
06:44:29,410 --> 06:44:31,510
Where we play a second game.

7299
06:44:32,030 --> 06:44:32,890
It's funny because like...

7300
06:44:32,890 --> 06:44:35,340
It's always like they either watch Hell's Kitchen...

7301
06:44:36,910 --> 06:44:37,990
What was the other one?

7302
06:44:38,010 --> 06:44:38,830
The hotel one?

7303
06:44:39,330 --> 06:44:39,830
The...

7304
06:44:40,370 --> 06:44:41,510
Hell's...It's not Hell's Kitchen.

7305
06:44:41,610 --> 06:44:42,570
Ah, what is it called?

7306
06:44:42,890 --> 06:44:43,390
The...

7307
06:44:43,390 --> 06:44:44,890
Refurbishment of hotels?

7308
06:44:45,030 --> 06:44:45,690
Hotel Hell?

7309
06:44:46,070 --> 06:44:47,190
Yeah, Hotel Hell.

7310
06:44:47,730 --> 06:44:49,970
Or like the other one for restaurants.

7311
06:44:50,910 --> 06:44:51,950
Restaurant Hell.

7312
06:44:52,510 --> 06:44:53,290
Or like...

7313
06:44:53,290 --> 06:44:54,510
They watch MasterChef.

7314
06:44:54,590 --> 06:44:57,410
It's like I do all of this...

7315
06:44:57,410 --> 06:44:58,950
To pass the time.

7316
06:45:00,370 --> 06:45:02,250
I don't know who I gave this to.

7317
06:45:03,510 --> 06:45:04,630
Oh, it's to Magneto.

7318
06:45:04,890 --> 06:45:07,830
I feel like I'm gonna get...

7319
06:45:07,830 --> 06:45:09,590
A Hawkeye just standing there.

7320
06:45:10,090 --> 06:45:10,650
I feel like.

7321
06:45:13,050 --> 06:45:13,670
I don't know.

7322
06:45:18,470 --> 06:45:19,210
I don't know.

7323
06:45:19,270 --> 06:45:20,050
It's a little scary.

7324
06:45:20,170 --> 06:45:20,890
Standing here.

7325
06:45:22,810 --> 06:45:24,090
Just a little scary.

7326
06:45:24,630 --> 06:45:25,110
You know?

7327
06:45:25,250 --> 06:45:26,130
Just a...

7328
06:45:26,130 --> 06:45:27,310
Just a...

7329
06:45:27,310 --> 06:45:30,030
Just a little scary.

7330
06:45:30,170 --> 06:45:30,810
I have no idea.

7331
06:45:38,310 --> 06:45:40,950
I'm a little scared just standing all the way over there.

7332
06:45:40,950 --> 06:45:42,610
Because I don't know where the Hawkeye is.

7333
06:45:42,670 --> 06:45:43,850
I don't...

7334
06:45:43,850 --> 06:45:50,530
Oh my god.

7335
06:45:51,170 --> 06:45:53,410
We're not gonna be watching shows.

7336
06:45:53,570 --> 06:45:55,450
I wanna keep my VODs.

7337
06:45:55,550 --> 06:45:55,910
Guys.

7338
06:45:59,110 --> 06:46:00,390
Oh shit.

7339
06:46:00,870 --> 06:46:03,350
Guys, I wanna be able to keep my VODs.

7340
06:46:03,410 --> 06:46:03,750
Guys.

7341
06:46:07,530 --> 06:46:08,630
I'm gonna...

7342
06:46:08,630 --> 06:46:10,270
I'll watch like...

7343
06:46:10,270 --> 06:46:11,410
I'll play a game.

7344
06:46:11,950 --> 06:46:12,910
Cause that's safer.

7345
06:46:22,010 --> 06:46:24,350
I hope they don't die.

7346
06:46:27,390 --> 06:46:28,290
I hope they don't die.

7347
06:46:30,110 --> 06:46:31,430
Oh my god.

7348
06:46:32,250 --> 06:46:33,070
I'm ready.

7349
06:46:33,950 --> 06:46:35,210
I'm so ready.

7350
06:46:35,750 --> 06:46:38,070
I'm putting a fucking show!

7351
06:46:45,110 --> 06:46:46,310
It doesn't matter.

7352
06:46:51,110 --> 06:46:53,630
I did put a show though.

7353
06:46:54,090 --> 06:46:54,610
I did.

7354
06:46:57,050 --> 06:46:59,070
I did put a show though.

7355
06:47:00,790 --> 06:47:01,150
Oh.

7356
06:47:01,750 --> 06:47:02,790
That's fucking rough buddy.

7357
06:47:03,530 --> 06:47:03,930
That's...

7358
06:47:12,890 --> 06:47:14,330
That's why...

7359
06:47:14,330 --> 06:47:15,070
I don't understand.

7360
06:47:15,190 --> 06:47:17,690
That's why I fucking ban Hawkeye all the time.

7361
06:47:20,530 --> 06:47:22,330
So whoever has the better Hawkeye...

7362
06:47:24,630 --> 06:47:25,230
They're...

7363
06:47:27,970 --> 06:47:30,670
I don't think Hawkeye liked my show.

7364
06:47:31,110 --> 06:47:32,330
I don't...

7365
06:47:35,050 --> 06:47:37,810
I guess I don't think he liked my show.

7366
06:47:38,730 --> 06:47:39,250
I don't know.

7367
06:47:39,250 --> 06:47:40,530
I don't know.

7368
06:47:48,930 --> 06:47:51,510
I don't think he was a fan guys.

7369
06:47:53,970 --> 06:47:57,070
I like the winter outfit.

7370
06:47:57,150 --> 06:47:58,090
Winter outfit's cute.

7371
06:47:58,410 --> 06:47:58,650
Yeah.

7372
06:48:01,750 --> 06:48:02,290
Um...

7373
06:48:02,290 --> 06:48:05,490
I'm not spending any money until I get my sponsor.

7374
06:48:06,890 --> 06:48:07,310
Oh hey!

7375
06:48:08,530 --> 06:48:09,490
Who's this guy?

7376
06:48:09,950 --> 06:48:11,430
Oh my god it's Mr. Fister.

7377
06:48:11,690 --> 06:48:12,190
Oh it's Rex.

7378
06:48:14,110 --> 06:48:15,110
Oh he's nice.

7379
06:48:15,750 --> 06:48:16,750
Oh this guy.

7380
06:48:16,910 --> 06:48:17,890
This is the Raccoon player.

7381
06:48:18,010 --> 06:48:20,130
I fucking roasted him in my stream.

7382
06:48:20,470 --> 06:48:21,510
But like...

7383
06:48:21,510 --> 06:48:22,110
Oh he lost.

7384
06:48:22,210 --> 06:48:22,950
Thank fucking god.

7385
06:48:23,210 --> 06:48:23,610
I'm sorry.

7386
06:48:25,730 --> 06:48:26,230
Yes!

7387
06:48:29,350 --> 06:48:30,910
This brings me joy.

7388
06:48:33,610 --> 06:48:34,410
I'm sorry.

7389
06:48:34,650 --> 06:48:35,290
It's not you.

7390
06:48:35,350 --> 06:48:37,330
I just don't like Raccoon players in general.

7391
06:48:37,890 --> 06:48:38,890
It's not you.

7392
06:48:39,850 --> 06:48:40,990
It's not you.

7393
06:48:40,990 --> 06:48:42,810
I legitimately...

7394
06:48:42,810 --> 06:48:44,470
I just don't like Raccoon players.

7395
06:48:44,970 --> 06:48:46,530
I swear to god.

7396
06:48:47,430 --> 06:48:48,550
They're all so...

7397
06:48:48,550 --> 06:48:49,730
This is what I mean!

7398
06:48:49,910 --> 06:48:50,810
They're all so...

7399
06:48:50,810 --> 06:48:52,450
They're not sniping.

7400
06:48:52,610 --> 06:48:55,250
They're trying to min-max top 10 right now.

7401
06:48:56,970 --> 06:48:58,010
So like...

7402
06:48:58,010 --> 06:48:59,450
I get caught in the crossfire.

7403
06:48:59,830 --> 06:49:02,250
Because I just want to know what it's like to be top 500.

7404
06:49:02,650 --> 06:49:04,590
I just want...

7405
06:49:04,590 --> 06:49:05,670
So like...

7406
06:49:05,670 --> 06:49:08,150
I get caught in the crossfire in general.

7407
06:49:09,590 --> 06:49:11,670
Because there's only like 3 days left.

7408
06:49:11,850 --> 06:49:14,490
So all the top 10 players are like min-maxing.

7409
06:49:15,090 --> 06:49:15,150
So all the top 10 players are like min-maxing.

7410
06:49:15,150 --> 06:49:16,970
And trying to become top 10.

7411
06:49:23,930 --> 06:49:25,290
They are?

7412
06:49:29,080 --> 06:49:30,400
They are here?

7413
06:49:32,000 --> 06:49:33,520
I hate everything.

7414
06:49:34,080 --> 06:49:35,820
Marble Rivals has like...

7415
06:49:36,620 --> 06:49:38,940
Marble Rivals has like...

7416
06:49:38,940 --> 06:49:40,120
unlocked something inside me.

7417
06:49:40,800 --> 06:49:42,300
And I like it.

7418
06:49:54,200 --> 06:49:55,640
Real and true.

7419
06:49:56,500 --> 06:49:56,860
It's...

7420
06:49:56,860 --> 06:49:58,840
I'm tired of being a nice guy.

7421
06:49:59,720 --> 06:50:01,420
I want to be part...

7422
06:50:01,420 --> 06:50:02,060
You know what?

7423
06:50:02,260 --> 06:50:04,140
Maybe Hydra ain't so...

7424
06:50:04,920 --> 06:50:05,700
I think...

7425
06:50:05,700 --> 06:50:08,060
I feel like Hydra must be like a great place to work for.

7426
06:50:08,060 --> 06:50:09,280
Because like...

7427
06:50:09,280 --> 06:50:11,460
I feel like they must have good benefits, you know?

7428
06:50:12,540 --> 06:50:13,060
It's like...

7429
06:50:13,060 --> 06:50:13,480
I don't know.

7430
06:50:13,580 --> 06:50:14,660
I feel like...

7431
06:50:14,660 --> 06:50:17,180
If you look at Hydra versus Agents of Shield.

7432
06:50:17,620 --> 06:50:18,860
Or like...

7433
06:50:18,860 --> 06:50:20,700
I feel like...

7434
06:50:20,700 --> 06:50:21,700
Oh shit!

7435
06:50:21,780 --> 06:50:22,580
Wait, they are?

7436
06:50:23,700 --> 06:50:24,220
Wait!

7437
06:50:24,440 --> 06:50:25,720
Oh, I did not know.

7438
06:50:26,120 --> 06:50:27,100
I mean...

7439
06:50:27,100 --> 06:50:30,500
I will work for Agents of Shield.

7440
06:50:31,020 --> 06:50:33,060
I didn't know!

7441
06:50:33,400 --> 06:50:34,760
I didn't know!

7442
06:50:34,760 --> 06:50:36,940
I didn't know!

7443
06:50:37,500 --> 06:50:38,500
I just...

7444
06:50:38,500 --> 06:50:40,640
I was like...

7445
06:50:40,640 --> 06:50:43,160
I do not work for Hydra.

7446
06:50:43,420 --> 06:50:44,100
Understood.

7447
06:50:45,700 --> 06:50:46,380
I...

7448
06:50:46,380 --> 06:50:47,720
Guys, I never...

7449
06:50:47,720 --> 06:50:49,380
Guys, I never watched Captain America.

7450
06:50:49,700 --> 06:50:51,080
I never watched the movie.

7451
06:50:51,280 --> 06:50:53,880
I just know Hydras are like the bad guys.

7452
06:50:54,320 --> 06:50:56,340
In the MCU.

7453
06:50:57,040 --> 06:50:57,680
But like...

7454
06:50:57,680 --> 06:51:00,680
I didn't realize their origins.

7455
06:51:01,100 --> 06:51:02,260
I just thought...

7456
06:51:02,260 --> 06:51:03,260
I just...

7457
06:51:03,260 --> 06:51:07,040
I just thought they were just a supervillain group.

7458
06:51:07,760 --> 06:51:12,280
I just thought...

7459
06:51:12,800 --> 06:51:15,480
They were like a regular supervillain group.

7460
06:51:15,680 --> 06:51:16,280
Like Skeletors.

7461
06:51:17,300 --> 06:51:19,500
I thought they were just like Skeletor.

7462
06:51:23,120 --> 06:51:24,780
No, I'm not.

7463
06:51:25,220 --> 06:51:27,520
Supervillains are just Nazis.

7464
06:51:28,180 --> 06:51:31,240
I swear I didn't know.

7465
06:51:31,240 --> 06:51:32,440
I was just...

7466
06:51:32,440 --> 06:51:34,380
I was just trying to yap.

7467
06:51:37,900 --> 06:51:38,780
Guys, I...

7468
06:51:38,780 --> 06:51:40,280
Guys, please, I didn't know.

7469
06:51:40,480 --> 06:51:42,300
I didn't know.

7470
06:51:42,420 --> 06:51:43,840
I thought they were like Skeletor.

7471
06:51:44,040 --> 06:51:47,120
I legitimately thought they were like Skeletor, guys.

7472
06:51:47,400 --> 06:51:49,580
I thought it was like the Thanos shit.

7473
06:51:49,680 --> 06:51:49,960
You know?

7474
06:51:50,060 --> 06:51:51,660
Like the typical villain group.

7475
06:51:52,840 --> 06:51:54,140
You know, I should have known.

7476
06:51:54,300 --> 06:51:56,480
Because like, they came from Captain America.

7477
06:51:56,980 --> 06:51:58,980
And legit, Steve Rogers...

7478
06:51:58,980 --> 06:52:00,460
He's literally just...

7479
06:52:00,980 --> 06:52:03,940
He... Steve Rogers is like...

7480
06:52:03,940 --> 06:52:05,900
You know, he's fighting World War 2.

7481
06:52:06,180 --> 06:52:08,640
And we all know what's going on in World War 2.

7482
06:52:09,120 --> 06:52:09,540
We know.

7483
06:52:10,220 --> 06:52:10,880
Let's go.

7484
06:52:12,100 --> 06:52:12,640
I...

7485
06:52:12,640 --> 06:52:14,220
Yeah, I should have...

7486
06:52:14,220 --> 06:52:15,680
I should have...

7487
06:52:15,680 --> 06:52:18,760
From context wise, I should have known.

7488
06:52:19,540 --> 06:52:20,640
I should have known.

7489
06:52:23,460 --> 06:52:25,220
It's okay, I'm just ignorant, guys.

7490
06:52:26,340 --> 06:52:26,900
Anyway...

7491
06:52:28,280 --> 06:52:28,760
Anyway...

7492
06:52:28,760 --> 06:52:31,080
I feel like working for a villain in general...

7493
06:52:31,080 --> 06:52:33,540
The health benefits must be really, really good.

7494
06:52:33,720 --> 06:52:34,760
To work for a villain.

7495
06:52:35,200 --> 06:52:36,200
Like, just like...

7496
06:52:36,200 --> 06:52:37,800
Employment benefits in general.

7497
06:52:38,740 --> 06:52:39,700
Because like...

7498
06:52:39,700 --> 06:52:41,840
If you think about it, you know you're gonna...

7499
06:52:41,840 --> 06:52:44,100
Like, you know, the risk of dying...

7500
06:52:44,100 --> 06:52:45,800
From the supervillain...

7501
06:52:45,800 --> 06:52:48,180
Must be like, really...

7502
06:52:48,180 --> 06:52:49,380
Like, you know...

7503
06:52:49,380 --> 06:52:52,280
You know you're fucking working for a bad guy.

7504
06:52:52,580 --> 06:52:56,020
So like, what are the benefits of working for a bad guy?

7505
06:52:56,020 --> 06:52:57,700
So like, I'm just thinking...

7506
06:52:57,700 --> 06:52:59,840
Maybe they have like, 401Ks...

7507
06:52:59,840 --> 06:53:01,480
And like, insurance or some shit.

7508
06:53:02,620 --> 06:53:05,320
Because like, the Joker is scared of insurance companies.

7509
06:53:06,080 --> 06:53:07,700
Or like, taxes and stuff.

7510
06:53:09,260 --> 06:53:10,460
No, not like Hydra.

7511
06:53:10,580 --> 06:53:12,480
We're off the topic of Hydra, guys.

7512
06:53:12,600 --> 06:53:12,960
We're...

7513
06:53:12,960 --> 06:53:15,440
Hydra, no matter what...

7514
06:53:15,440 --> 06:53:16,700
They're just... They're Nazi.

7515
06:53:19,740 --> 06:53:21,700
Yeah, he's like, scared of the IRS.

7516
06:53:23,040 --> 06:53:24,260
So like, maybe like...

7517
06:53:25,320 --> 06:53:25,880
Working...

7518
06:53:25,880 --> 06:53:27,900
Maybe working for villains ain't so bad.

7519
06:53:30,140 --> 06:53:31,900
Like, I'm just thinking...

7520
06:53:31,900 --> 06:53:34,460
Because like, the potential to die...

7521
06:53:34,460 --> 06:53:35,340
Because like, you...

7522
06:53:35,340 --> 06:53:38,680
There's a higher risk to die working for a villain...

7523
06:53:38,680 --> 06:53:40,540
Than it is to die working for a hero.

7524
06:53:41,420 --> 06:53:42,940
So like, I'm just thinking...

7525
06:53:42,940 --> 06:53:46,320
Maybe like, employment benefits outweighs the...

7526
06:53:46,320 --> 06:53:48,420
The pros and cons.

7527
06:53:50,520 --> 06:53:51,640
And so...

7528
06:53:51,640 --> 06:53:53,640
So like, maybe you get like, retirement...

7529
06:53:53,640 --> 06:53:54,200
Or your fam...

7530
06:53:54,200 --> 06:53:56,920
Like, if you die from the job...

7531
06:53:56,920 --> 06:53:59,900
Maybe like, you know, your family's like, set for life.

7532
06:54:01,320 --> 06:54:02,300
So that's a Spider-Man.

7533
06:54:02,540 --> 06:54:03,960
Yeah, but I feel like...

7534
06:54:03,960 --> 06:54:05,140
If you work for like...

7535
06:54:05,140 --> 06:54:07,360
If you're a hero, you get less shit.

7536
06:54:07,480 --> 06:54:10,000
Because you know, heroes are like...

7537
06:54:10,000 --> 06:54:12,740
Heroes are pussies and they're like, I'm doing this for free.

7538
06:54:14,560 --> 06:54:17,460
I wonder if fucking Peter Parker is a broke-ass bitch.

7539
06:54:18,140 --> 06:54:19,620
But like, because they're like...

7540
06:54:20,260 --> 06:54:22,980
My reward is the reward of the people.

7541
06:54:23,400 --> 06:54:23,840
You know?

7542
06:54:24,100 --> 06:54:25,580
But like, don't fuck that.

7543
06:54:25,700 --> 06:54:26,380
I won't get paid.

7544
06:54:26,900 --> 06:54:28,240
I'm gonna save your fucking life.

7545
06:54:28,640 --> 06:54:32,840
Like, the government should pay me.

7546
06:54:33,000 --> 06:54:33,360
You know?

7547
06:54:34,080 --> 06:54:35,820
Like, if you didn't...

7548
06:54:35,820 --> 06:54:37,460
If I wasn't there...

7549
06:54:38,380 --> 06:54:40,020
People would have died.

7550
06:54:40,120 --> 06:54:42,380
So I should be paid by the government.

7551
06:54:47,460 --> 06:54:48,860
You know, I'm right.

7552
06:54:49,020 --> 06:54:51,820
A hero is literally like...

7553
06:54:51,820 --> 06:54:52,940
Saving the world.

7554
06:54:53,320 --> 06:54:54,420
Every day.

7555
06:54:55,300 --> 06:54:57,620
And what benefits do they get?

7556
06:54:57,800 --> 06:54:58,180
Honor?

7557
06:54:58,540 --> 06:54:58,940
The fuck?

7558
06:54:59,040 --> 06:55:00,160
Honor doesn't pay rent.

7559
06:55:02,240 --> 06:55:05,100
No, I'll just be like...

7560
06:55:05,100 --> 06:55:05,920
Hero for hire.

7561
06:55:12,280 --> 06:55:13,260
That's right.

7562
06:55:13,260 --> 06:55:13,340
That's right.

7563
06:55:14,700 --> 06:55:15,980
Okay, but like...

7564
06:55:15,980 --> 06:55:17,900
They can't all be Batman, guys.

7565
06:55:18,160 --> 06:55:21,500
Not every hero can have millions of dollars.

7566
06:55:22,680 --> 06:55:23,700
You mean I'm mercenary?

7567
06:55:25,200 --> 06:55:27,340
No, because I'll still do good things.

7568
06:55:28,140 --> 06:55:30,700
I'd just rather be paid for my good deeds.

7569
06:55:35,920 --> 06:55:36,880
Because like...

7570
06:55:36,880 --> 06:55:39,700
Because like, Hawkeye gets paid by the government, technically.

7571
06:55:40,660 --> 06:55:43,680
So why can't the other characters get paid by the government?

7572
06:55:45,880 --> 06:55:46,100
That's horrible.

7573
06:55:46,380 --> 06:55:47,340
He doesn't count.

7574
06:55:49,860 --> 06:55:52,500
Also, why don't the billionaires pay for the other heroes' income?

7575
06:55:53,140 --> 06:55:56,120
Fucking Tony Stark could have paid for Peter Parker's rent.

7576
06:55:57,140 --> 06:55:59,000
I thought they were homies.

7577
06:55:59,520 --> 06:56:02,140
Instead, he just gave him a fucking suit and be like...

7578
06:56:02,140 --> 06:56:02,720
There you go.

7579
06:56:05,420 --> 06:56:06,840
That's so true.

7580
06:56:08,780 --> 06:56:11,440
Why can't he just pay for Peter Parker's rent?

7581
06:56:13,360 --> 06:56:15,160
He did once.

7582
06:56:15,260 --> 06:56:16,380
He did...

7583
06:56:16,380 --> 06:56:17,640
Oh, just one time.

7584
06:56:18,740 --> 06:56:19,880
Pay for his fucking college.

7585
06:56:20,680 --> 06:56:21,720
That boy's 16.

7586
06:56:21,900 --> 06:56:23,720
He needs someone to pay for his college.

7587
06:56:28,470 --> 06:56:30,510
It raised suspicion, I guess.

7588
06:56:30,870 --> 06:56:31,830
He's a billionaire.

7589
06:56:32,250 --> 06:56:34,870
He can fucking kill ten people and hide it.

7590
06:56:37,170 --> 06:56:38,550
They'll just be like...

7591
06:56:38,550 --> 06:56:39,450
I didn't do it.

7592
06:56:39,590 --> 06:56:40,830
Here's ten million dollars.

7593
06:56:43,510 --> 06:56:44,950
I'm aware.

7594
06:56:46,710 --> 06:56:48,150
Doki, please.

7595
06:56:55,120 --> 06:56:58,020
In fact, why doesn't he fund...

7596
06:56:58,020 --> 06:56:59,980
Professor Xavier's school?

7597
06:57:00,180 --> 06:57:01,980
Why does he need fucking handouts?

7598
06:57:08,740 --> 06:57:09,760
College just never...

7599
06:57:10,080 --> 06:57:11,480
Doki would need it.

7600
06:57:12,180 --> 06:57:14,840
Because he's not a mutant.

7601
06:57:15,200 --> 06:57:17,480
Oh yeah, but he uses the mutants...

7602
06:57:17,480 --> 06:57:19,160
Whenever he feels like it.

7603
06:57:20,440 --> 06:57:22,400
Because they're mutants.

7604
06:57:22,980 --> 06:57:24,420
Oh shit, is Tony Stark like me?

7605
06:57:26,600 --> 06:57:27,480
You know what?

7606
06:57:27,520 --> 06:57:28,940
I think he's a cool guy.

7607
06:57:29,440 --> 06:57:29,760
You know what?

7608
06:57:29,800 --> 06:57:30,080
Nah.

7609
06:57:30,340 --> 06:57:31,520
He's cool in my book.

7610
06:57:32,460 --> 06:57:32,980
Nevermind.

7611
06:57:33,300 --> 06:57:33,820
He's cool.

7612
06:57:40,680 --> 06:57:41,200
Wow.

7613
06:57:47,480 --> 06:57:48,480
What happens if fucking...

7614
06:57:48,480 --> 06:57:49,460
You know he's old, right?

7615
06:57:49,680 --> 06:57:50,420
Professor Xavier?

7616
06:57:51,060 --> 06:57:52,860
What do they do when he dies?

7617
06:57:53,600 --> 06:57:54,960
Where is the school gonna get money?

7618
06:57:55,800 --> 06:57:57,460
He died like several times...

7619
06:57:57,460 --> 06:57:58,220
In the X-Men universe.

7620
06:57:59,720 --> 06:58:02,220
He's already dead several times.

7621
06:58:09,680 --> 06:58:11,180
Oh my god.

7622
06:58:11,400 --> 06:58:13,840
Alright, we're fucking pulling up a different game.

7623
06:58:14,900 --> 06:58:16,300
While we wait in queue.

7624
06:58:16,780 --> 06:58:18,520
Alright, what game should we do?

7625
06:58:20,900 --> 06:58:23,980
What is a good game that I can just play...

7626
06:58:23,980 --> 06:58:26,840
And don't need to worry about streaming on YouTube?

7627
06:58:28,260 --> 06:58:28,800
Tetris?

7628
06:58:29,200 --> 06:58:31,360
Nah, I don't really want to play Tetris.

7629
06:58:32,560 --> 06:58:35,080
I'm looking at like stuff we can play.

7630
06:58:37,160 --> 06:58:38,140
I wanna play...

7631
06:58:38,140 --> 06:58:40,700
I wanna play Bellatro like...

7632
06:58:40,700 --> 06:58:43,160
On stream.

7633
06:58:43,340 --> 06:58:43,840
On YouTube.

7634
06:58:44,140 --> 06:58:45,540
I know I'm like streaming right now.

7635
06:58:45,980 --> 06:58:47,200
But I wanna... Wait!

7636
06:58:47,200 --> 06:58:47,600
Wait!

7637
06:58:49,700 --> 06:58:51,380
This is a game that I've been wanting to play.

7638
06:58:51,680 --> 06:58:52,560
But I'll play it here.

7639
06:58:52,920 --> 06:58:54,880
I heard about the new Squid Game Roblox game.

7640
06:58:55,500 --> 06:59:00,340
I heard about that...

7641
06:59:00,340 --> 06:59:02,680
The Squid Game Roblox game.

7642
06:59:02,760 --> 06:59:04,260
And I actually wanted to try it out.

7643
06:59:04,340 --> 06:59:06,360
Am I allowed to be on voice chat though?

7644
06:59:07,460 --> 06:59:10,220
How do I get in voice chat for the Roblox?

7645
06:59:12,740 --> 06:59:13,340
Uh...

7646
06:59:14,140 --> 06:59:15,760
Wait, here I select this spot.

7647
06:59:16,680 --> 06:59:17,420
What is spawning?

7648
06:59:19,340 --> 06:59:20,680
Alright, let me see.

7649
06:59:22,540 --> 06:59:23,660
Oh, I need...

7650
06:59:23,660 --> 06:59:25,940
I can't hear them scream.

7651
06:59:26,140 --> 06:59:27,800
I can't hear the little kids scream.

7652
06:59:28,580 --> 06:59:31,640
And like grown ass adults scream too.

7653
06:59:32,240 --> 06:59:34,160
That sounded so bad out of context.

7654
06:59:34,840 --> 06:59:36,900
Uh, which one recommended for me?

7655
06:59:37,020 --> 06:59:37,520
Mingle?

7656
06:59:37,820 --> 06:59:38,700
The Squid Game?

7657
06:59:38,700 --> 06:59:39,680
Which one was it?

7658
06:59:40,620 --> 06:59:42,140
Was it Season 2 Squid Game?

7659
06:59:42,260 --> 06:59:45,140
Which one was the Squid Game where like you can hear...

7660
06:59:45,140 --> 06:59:47,540
You can actually hear people scream in the background?

7661
06:59:49,220 --> 06:59:50,480
There's so many.

7662
06:59:54,580 --> 06:59:56,360
What do you mean?

7663
06:59:56,400 --> 06:59:57,880
I just want...

7664
06:59:57,880 --> 07:00:00,760
I'm just trying to find that Squid Game!

7665
07:00:01,980 --> 07:00:03,340
Is it Shrimp Game?

7666
07:00:04,240 --> 07:00:06,560
The one where you can hear them scream?

7667
07:00:08,160 --> 07:00:09,060
Wait, what?

7668
07:00:10,560 --> 07:00:12,180
What are you having your 1v1?

7669
07:00:13,220 --> 07:00:14,240
What are you doing?

7670
07:00:17,960 --> 07:00:19,900
Oh my god, they're fucking brawling.

7671
07:00:20,480 --> 07:00:21,740
Is this Shrimp Game?

7672
07:00:22,040 --> 07:00:23,080
Oh my god, they are.

7673
07:00:24,220 --> 07:00:25,940
They're fucking brawling now.

7674
07:00:26,820 --> 07:00:28,480
Oh, they're letting out the anger.

7675
07:00:29,040 --> 07:00:30,180
Alright, Shrimp Game.

7676
07:00:30,900 --> 07:00:32,420
Shrimp Game Roblox.

7677
07:00:32,900 --> 07:00:33,860
Let's boot this up.

7678
07:00:35,700 --> 07:00:36,640
I hope I don't like...

7679
07:00:36,640 --> 07:00:37,480
Crash my own.

7680
07:00:38,470 --> 07:00:40,160
No, I can't!

7681
07:00:40,160 --> 07:00:42,060
I'm so stupid!

7682
07:00:42,300 --> 07:00:44,480
I forgot I can't do anything!

7683
07:00:44,860 --> 07:00:47,040
My OBS disappeared!

7684
07:00:48,210 --> 07:00:49,180
I forgot!

7685
07:00:50,250 --> 07:00:52,650
I forgot my OBS disappeared!

7686
07:00:57,320 --> 07:00:59,200
I'm so sad.

7687
07:00:59,420 --> 07:01:01,540
I really wanted to play.

7688
07:01:01,800 --> 07:01:03,460
My OBS is still...

7689
07:01:03,460 --> 07:01:05,080
How do I push it back to the...

7690
07:01:05,080 --> 07:01:06,680
Guys, okay, so like...

7691
07:01:06,680 --> 07:01:08,860
It's not in my apps right now.

7692
07:01:09,080 --> 07:01:09,980
That's the thing.

7693
07:01:10,140 --> 07:01:13,460
My OBS literally disappeared from...

7694
07:01:15,260 --> 07:01:16,380
From my apps.

7695
07:01:16,960 --> 07:01:19,600
And when I press alt tab...

7696
07:01:19,600 --> 07:01:20,700
There's no OBS.

7697
07:01:22,240 --> 07:01:23,120
But like...

7698
07:01:23,120 --> 07:01:25,620
But if I close it, then I make another...

7699
07:01:25,620 --> 07:01:27,620
Stream and I don't want to do that.

7700
07:01:27,700 --> 07:01:30,160
I don't want to make another stream.

7701
07:01:30,160 --> 07:01:30,240
Okay.

7702
07:01:31,260 --> 07:01:32,580
Wait, is it...

7703
07:01:32,580 --> 07:01:33,620
Is it on my other tab?

7704
07:01:34,260 --> 07:01:36,000
No, I don't have another window.

7705
07:01:36,920 --> 07:01:39,100
I'm pressing window tab...

7706
07:01:39,100 --> 07:01:40,380
And it doesn't exist.

7707
07:01:41,240 --> 07:01:43,040
It actually doesn't exist.

7708
07:01:43,420 --> 07:01:44,020
Anywhere.

7709
07:01:45,840 --> 07:01:46,600
It's gone.

7710
07:01:47,740 --> 07:01:49,340
I don't see it.

7711
07:01:50,500 --> 07:01:52,580
I don't see it at all.

7712
07:01:54,120 --> 07:01:56,100
Yeah, there's no other desktop now.

7713
07:01:56,100 --> 07:01:57,820
There's no new desktop.

7714
07:01:58,000 --> 07:01:59,060
It's literally like one.

7715
07:01:59,340 --> 07:01:59,980
Desktop one.

7716
07:02:02,620 --> 07:02:03,540
Try a search bar.

7717
07:02:03,760 --> 07:02:05,560
Can I look it up?

7718
07:02:05,960 --> 07:02:06,480
OBS.

7719
07:02:07,520 --> 07:02:07,940
No?

7720
07:02:09,000 --> 07:02:11,020
No, because then I have to reopen it.

7721
07:02:13,500 --> 07:02:15,360
Might have to try...

7722
07:02:15,360 --> 07:02:17,640
No, but I don't want to make another one.

7723
07:02:18,460 --> 07:02:19,500
I don't...

7724
07:02:19,500 --> 07:02:21,260
I don't want to make...

7725
07:02:21,260 --> 07:02:22,040
Oh, I found it!

7726
07:02:22,160 --> 07:02:23,280
I got it back!

7727
07:02:23,280 --> 07:02:24,460
I found it!

7728
07:02:25,100 --> 07:02:26,420
I did it, guys.

7729
07:02:26,520 --> 07:02:27,420
I don't know how I did.

7730
07:02:27,700 --> 07:02:28,480
I just...

7731
07:02:28,480 --> 07:02:29,220
I did it.

7732
07:02:29,320 --> 07:02:30,140
Alright, nice.

7733
07:02:30,260 --> 07:02:31,140
Now I can play Roblox.

7734
07:02:31,360 --> 07:02:32,100
Alright, guys.

7735
07:02:33,120 --> 07:02:34,060
I did it.

7736
07:02:34,740 --> 07:02:35,400
I'm gonna tell you.

7737
07:02:35,540 --> 07:02:36,460
I'm not gonna...

7738
07:02:36,460 --> 07:02:38,040
Explain how I found it.

7739
07:02:38,800 --> 07:02:40,440
Because I think like...

7740
07:02:40,440 --> 07:02:43,120
You guys are gonna be very embarrassed...

7741
07:02:43,120 --> 07:02:45,180
At me, so...

7742
07:02:47,800 --> 07:02:48,280
So...

7743
07:02:48,280 --> 07:02:51,160
So I'm not gonna explain how I did it.

7744
07:02:57,940 --> 07:02:58,620
Alright.

7745
07:02:59,180 --> 07:02:59,200
Alright, copy.

7746
07:03:00,780 --> 07:03:01,460
Okay.

7747
07:03:02,000 --> 07:03:03,300
Alright, guys.

7748
07:03:06,800 --> 07:03:07,960
There we go.

7749
07:03:08,280 --> 07:03:08,780
Wait!

7750
07:03:09,180 --> 07:03:10,040
Do I need to...

7751
07:03:10,040 --> 07:03:12,140
Wait, why is it not showing up?

7752
07:03:12,940 --> 07:03:15,060
Why is my Roblox not showing up?

7753
07:03:16,020 --> 07:03:17,640
How do I make it show up?

7754
07:03:19,060 --> 07:03:20,620
Where's my Roblox?

7755
07:03:20,980 --> 07:03:21,300
Hello?

7756
07:03:21,300 --> 07:03:21,520
Hello?

7757
07:03:24,020 --> 07:03:25,640
Hey, where's my Roblox?

7758
07:03:27,920 --> 07:03:29,340
Oh, I have to...

7759
07:03:29,340 --> 07:03:30,480
I have to use window...

7760
07:03:30,480 --> 07:03:32,620
I forgot I have to use window capture!

7761
07:03:33,060 --> 07:03:33,680
So dumb.

7762
07:03:34,540 --> 07:03:34,920
Okay.

7763
07:03:36,660 --> 07:03:37,220
Roblox.

7764
07:03:37,420 --> 07:03:38,000
There we go.

7765
07:03:45,070 --> 07:03:46,130
Wait, I'm not ready.

7766
07:03:46,330 --> 07:03:47,370
I'm not ready.

7767
07:03:47,650 --> 07:03:48,750
Wait, I'm not ready!

7768
07:03:49,230 --> 07:03:53,730
Give me a sec!

7769
07:03:54,750 --> 07:03:55,590
What happened?

7770
07:03:55,590 --> 07:03:57,730
Oh, we need 50 players.

7771
07:03:57,850 --> 07:03:59,330
Okay, okay, there we go.

7772
07:03:59,570 --> 07:04:00,330
I'm in.

7773
07:04:00,710 --> 07:04:01,990
I'm fucking in.

7774
07:04:02,090 --> 07:04:03,890
Oh, I'm lagging, but I'm in.

7775
07:04:09,040 --> 07:04:10,720
I'm in, but I'm lagging.

7776
07:04:11,080 --> 07:04:12,620
I'm in, but I'm lagging.

7777
07:04:12,720 --> 07:04:13,380
Let's go.

7778
07:04:14,500 --> 07:04:15,500
Let's go.

7779
07:04:20,740 --> 07:04:21,560
Okay, computer.

7780
07:04:22,220 --> 07:04:23,660
Okay, we are in.

7781
07:04:23,660 --> 07:04:24,900
We are in.

7782
07:04:25,440 --> 07:04:25,600
Cute.

7783
07:04:29,940 --> 07:04:32,560
Guys, I don't know if we can play Roblox, guys.

7784
07:04:32,940 --> 07:04:34,560
I don't know.

7785
07:04:35,220 --> 07:04:37,360
I don't know if we can play Roblox.

7786
07:04:37,620 --> 07:04:38,740
How is there only five?

7787
07:04:38,840 --> 07:04:39,700
I missed out!

7788
07:04:39,800 --> 07:04:40,580
I missed out!

7789
07:04:40,680 --> 07:04:42,420
Because I was trying to figure it out!

7790
07:04:45,020 --> 07:04:46,500
Guys, I need more players!

7791
07:04:48,520 --> 07:04:49,740
Oh my god, please!

7792
07:04:50,340 --> 07:04:51,920
We're only six of us!

7793
07:04:51,920 --> 07:04:53,620
People died!

7794
07:04:53,920 --> 07:04:54,740
Die now!

7795
07:04:55,200 --> 07:04:57,100
In game, in the stream game.

7796
07:05:00,730 --> 07:05:04,470
I'm literally waiting in the queue to wait for a queue.

7797
07:05:04,610 --> 07:05:06,290
That is so fucked up.

7798
07:05:06,670 --> 07:05:11,450
That is so fucked up.

7799
07:05:12,470 --> 07:05:15,770
I might as well boot a third game.

7800
07:05:15,930 --> 07:05:26,070
I boot up a third game to wait out the Roblox queue that's waiting out the fucking Marvel Rivals queue.

7801
07:05:27,170 --> 07:05:29,090
We've gotten full circle.

7802
07:05:29,350 --> 07:05:31,450
There's only nine of us!

7803
07:05:31,810 --> 07:05:33,090
Wait, I want clothes.

7804
07:05:34,230 --> 07:05:39,530
I like how here we're all equal and we don't have any cool... oh wait, nevermind.

7805
07:05:39,590 --> 07:05:41,170
We can't use our cool cosmetics.

7806
07:05:41,970 --> 07:05:44,530
We have to buy their cosmetics in this game.

7807
07:05:46,130 --> 07:05:54,550
I don't want to play Bellatro on Twitch because I want my very first Bellatro stream on YouTube.

7808
07:05:55,390 --> 07:05:57,790
Guys, we're in queue so we gotta wait.

7809
07:05:58,170 --> 07:06:00,510
But like, I'm in another queue right now too.

7810
07:06:00,850 --> 07:06:02,430
There's no way!

7811
07:06:03,510 --> 07:06:04,170
We're...

7812
07:06:04,870 --> 07:06:06,090
Where are the players?

7813
07:06:08,410 --> 07:06:10,870
How is there nobody here?

7814
07:06:11,710 --> 07:06:12,790
Get in!

7815
07:06:12,790 --> 07:06:12,850
Get in!

7816
07:06:15,890 --> 07:06:18,930
Oh my god, are everybody...

7817
07:06:18,930 --> 07:06:21,510
Okay, it requires eight players.

7818
07:06:21,930 --> 07:06:22,870
We're three.

7819
07:06:23,030 --> 07:06:24,110
There's three of us.

7820
07:06:24,450 --> 07:06:25,010
Okay.

7821
07:06:25,710 --> 07:06:27,010
Now there's two.

7822
07:06:29,290 --> 07:06:34,590
Guys, there has to be more of you.

7823
07:06:34,650 --> 07:06:35,890
How do I join another server?

7824
07:06:37,370 --> 07:06:39,430
How do I join another server, guys?

7825
07:06:40,830 --> 07:06:41,870
Copyrighted music.

7826
07:06:43,930 --> 07:06:46,530
Oh my god, just the two of us?

7827
07:06:46,790 --> 07:06:47,970
Just the three of us?

7828
07:06:48,550 --> 07:06:49,110
Hey guys!

7829
07:06:49,210 --> 07:06:50,310
Wait, you guys are veterans?

7830
07:06:50,810 --> 07:06:52,310
Hey, there's TSMCurry5.

7831
07:06:52,370 --> 07:06:53,750
I didn't know they recruited us.

7832
07:06:57,550 --> 07:06:59,530
Just the three of us?

7833
07:06:59,590 --> 07:07:00,930
Alright, we're gonna...

7834
07:07:00,930 --> 07:07:02,770
We're gonna join a new server.

7835
07:07:03,150 --> 07:07:03,910
Fuck this.

7836
07:07:04,810 --> 07:07:05,330
Alright.

7837
07:07:06,510 --> 07:07:08,130
I'm gonna fucking find another server.

7838
07:07:08,950 --> 07:07:11,230
I'm gonna reboot it and maybe I can get in.

7839
07:07:12,550 --> 07:07:15,350
Please, I don't want to wait in the queue to be in another queue.

7840
07:07:15,470 --> 07:07:17,230
Please, don't do this to me.

7841
07:07:22,070 --> 07:07:25,090
I'm literally waiting in the queue to be in the queue.

7842
07:07:25,410 --> 07:07:26,610
Oh my god, I'm in.

7843
07:07:27,030 --> 07:07:28,150
I'm fucking in.

7844
07:07:29,250 --> 07:07:29,830
There we go.

7845
07:07:31,130 --> 07:07:31,950
We're in.

7846
07:07:33,550 --> 07:07:34,870
We're lagging a little bit.

7847
07:07:34,910 --> 07:07:35,530
Oh my god.

7848
07:07:36,050 --> 07:07:38,210
We're lagging a little bit, but it's okay.

7849
07:07:40,170 --> 07:07:41,950
We should be able to start whenever, right?

7850
07:07:42,530 --> 07:07:43,370
Eight players to start?

7851
07:07:43,450 --> 07:07:44,170
Start the game!

7852
07:07:46,070 --> 07:07:47,770
Oh, there's 31 of us.

7853
07:07:48,390 --> 07:07:49,010
I want Nunu.

7854
07:07:49,250 --> 07:07:50,110
The fuck is Nunu?

7855
07:07:50,990 --> 07:07:52,630
What the fuck is Nunu?

7856
07:07:53,930 --> 07:07:55,050
Alright, here we go.

7857
07:07:55,810 --> 07:07:57,130
Here we fucking go.

7858
07:08:01,740 --> 07:08:02,220
Hello.

7859
07:08:04,320 --> 07:08:04,800
What?

7860
07:08:05,500 --> 07:08:06,700
Are we in?

7861
07:08:07,080 --> 07:08:07,800
What do we play?

7862
07:08:08,060 --> 07:08:09,760
What do we do?

7863
07:08:10,940 --> 07:08:11,920
Hello, everybody.

7864
07:08:12,200 --> 07:08:14,300
I'm player 272.

7865
07:08:15,240 --> 07:08:16,980
And I'm here to make friends.

7866
07:08:18,420 --> 07:08:20,020
In Shrimp Game.

7867
07:08:21,120 --> 07:08:23,520
I'm here to make friends.

7868
07:08:23,900 --> 07:08:25,540
Cash prize is zero dollars?

7869
07:08:26,900 --> 07:08:28,680
The fuck is this scam?

7870
07:08:28,740 --> 07:08:30,460
I'm dying for zero dollars?

7871
07:08:31,420 --> 07:08:31,960
I'm...

7872
07:08:37,460 --> 07:08:41,940
Guys, why is there Marvel Rivals in my Squid Game?

7873
07:08:47,280 --> 07:08:48,220
How dare...

7874
07:08:48,220 --> 07:08:49,920
I came here for Roblox.

7875
07:08:52,820 --> 07:08:53,800
And they're right here.

7876
07:08:54,200 --> 07:08:54,480
Bum.

7877
07:08:54,740 --> 07:08:55,020
Bum.

7878
07:08:55,240 --> 07:08:55,600
Bum.

7879
07:08:55,740 --> 07:08:56,040
Bum.

7880
07:08:56,180 --> 07:08:56,560
Bum.

7881
07:08:56,560 --> 07:08:57,060
Bum.

7882
07:08:57,060 --> 07:08:57,540
Bum.

7883
07:08:58,180 --> 07:08:58,460
Bum.

7884
07:08:59,440 --> 07:09:00,000
Bum.

7885
07:09:00,140 --> 07:09:00,460
Bum.

7886
07:09:00,660 --> 07:09:01,000
Bum.

7887
07:09:01,080 --> 07:09:01,500
Bum.

7888
07:09:01,740 --> 07:09:01,900
Bum.

7889
07:09:02,100 --> 07:09:02,280
Bum.

7890
07:09:02,280 --> 07:09:02,640
Bum.

7891
07:09:02,680 --> 07:09:02,880
Bum.

7892
07:09:03,140 --> 07:09:03,700
Bum.

7893
07:09:04,160 --> 07:09:05,480
Squid Game in Wakanda?

7894
07:09:08,980 --> 07:09:09,960
Hello, guys.

7895
07:09:10,280 --> 07:09:11,980
I'd like to send a heartfelt...

7896
07:09:11,980 --> 07:09:13,540
Oh, well, I guess I'll never...

7897
07:09:13,540 --> 07:09:15,220
I don't know the lore.

7898
07:09:23,690 --> 07:09:24,370
Oh my god.

7899
07:09:24,390 --> 07:09:25,350
It's red light, green light.

7900
07:09:29,350 --> 07:09:30,090
Alright, guys.

7901
07:09:30,110 --> 07:09:30,870
I'm so ready.

7902
07:09:32,870 --> 07:09:34,230
There's no way I could...

7903
07:09:34,230 --> 07:09:35,970
There's a...

7904
07:09:37,270 --> 07:09:37,830
Woooo.

7905
07:09:41,480 --> 07:09:42,880
Oh my god.

7906
07:09:43,140 --> 07:09:44,660
Oh my god.

7907
07:09:44,960 --> 07:09:45,520
Yay.

7908
07:09:51,410 --> 07:09:52,230
Oh my god.

7909
07:09:52,430 --> 07:09:53,530
Oh my god.

7910
07:09:53,790 --> 07:09:54,650
Oh my god.

7911
07:09:54,770 --> 07:09:54,850
I

7912
07:09:58,040 --> 07:10:00,780
fell.

7913
07:10:01,180 --> 07:10:01,760
I tripped.

7914
07:10:02,540 --> 07:10:04,240
I didn't realize that's a thing.

7915
07:10:04,300 --> 07:10:05,080
You can trip?

7916
07:10:08,690 --> 07:10:09,570
Oh my god.

7917
07:10:09,610 --> 07:10:10,890
They pushed...

7918
07:10:12,830 --> 07:10:13,950
I got no friends.

7919
07:10:14,190 --> 07:10:14,310
Okay.

7920
07:10:14,310 --> 07:10:14,610
Oh.

7921
07:10:15,070 --> 07:10:15,730
Oh my god.

7922
07:10:15,790 --> 07:10:16,470
You can push people?

7923
07:10:16,590 --> 07:10:17,270
That's so fucked.

7924
07:10:17,630 --> 07:10:19,210
I literally saw them push people.

7925
07:10:20,390 --> 07:10:21,150
I made it.

7926
07:10:21,310 --> 07:10:21,770
Oh my god.

7927
07:10:21,790 --> 07:10:22,130
I made it.

7928
07:10:22,330 --> 07:10:23,230
Oh my god.

7929
07:10:23,470 --> 07:10:24,330
Oh my god.

7930
07:10:24,430 --> 07:10:26,310
I just saw them push...

7931
07:10:26,990 --> 07:10:28,610
I can't get pushed?

7932
07:10:29,450 --> 07:10:30,610
That's so fucked.

7933
07:10:31,370 --> 07:10:33,490
That's actually so fucked.

7934
07:10:33,930 --> 07:10:37,370
I literally just saw people pushing each other.

7935
07:10:37,430 --> 07:10:39,330
I made it to the next day.

7936
07:10:39,790 --> 07:10:40,270
Yippee.

7937
07:10:40,510 --> 07:10:41,290
Oh my god.

7938
07:10:41,330 --> 07:10:42,450
I get $500,000.

7939
07:10:42,450 --> 07:10:43,070
$500,000.

7940
07:10:44,010 --> 07:10:46,050
That's like one month in New York City.

7941
07:10:46,150 --> 07:10:46,930
Let's go.

7942
07:10:47,850 --> 07:10:49,770
Let's fucking go.

7943
07:10:50,070 --> 07:10:51,770
Hostile kids are cruel.

7944
07:10:52,170 --> 07:10:54,030
Children are so cruel.

7945
07:10:55,710 --> 07:10:57,230
Did the match start yet?

7946
07:10:57,330 --> 07:10:57,490
No.

7947
07:10:57,590 --> 07:11:02,070
I was like, I didn't hear anything and I stopped hearing things so I got a little worried.

7948
07:11:04,890 --> 07:11:05,430
Alright.

7949
07:11:07,170 --> 07:11:07,990
What's that?

7950
07:11:08,150 --> 07:11:09,530
Are we doing red light, green light again?

7951
07:11:09,530 --> 07:11:11,410
Where are we?

7952
07:11:12,110 --> 07:11:13,530
Or is this a...

7953
07:11:13,530 --> 07:11:15,410
Oh, it's a shape.

7954
07:11:16,150 --> 07:11:16,850
What am I gonna get?

7955
07:11:18,530 --> 07:11:18,890
Oh.

7956
07:11:24,100 --> 07:11:24,920
Oh.

7957
07:11:25,680 --> 07:11:26,090
Oh.

7958
07:11:30,370 --> 07:11:31,190
Oh.

7959
07:11:33,190 --> 07:11:33,230
Oh.

7960
07:11:33,230 --> 07:11:33,930
How do I do?

7961
07:11:35,810 --> 07:11:37,010
Hostile ahead.

7962
07:11:38,650 --> 07:11:40,310
I'm worried, guys.

7963
07:11:41,990 --> 07:11:43,930
Guys, I'm so scared.

7964
07:11:47,660 --> 07:11:50,100
Guys, I'm so scared, guys.

7965
07:11:55,870 --> 07:11:57,550
I'm so scared.

7966
07:11:57,810 --> 07:12:00,290
Oh my god.

7967
07:12:00,670 --> 07:12:01,430
Oh my god.

7968
07:12:01,830 --> 07:12:02,750
Oh my god.

7969
07:12:04,510 --> 07:12:05,290
No.

7970
07:12:06,310 --> 07:12:08,390
No, we got a game.

7971
07:12:09,650 --> 07:12:10,050
No.

7972
07:12:16,580 --> 07:12:18,120
I still got it.

7973
07:12:18,120 --> 07:12:18,440
Oh.

7974
07:12:19,820 --> 07:12:21,320
Oh my god.

7975
07:12:23,630 --> 07:12:28,130
I just saw it get shot.

7976
07:12:28,690 --> 07:12:31,950
I saw the child get shot.

7977
07:12:32,110 --> 07:12:33,290
Oh my god.

7978
07:12:35,250 --> 07:12:36,750
That's crazy.

7979
07:12:37,530 --> 07:12:38,570
Okay, I still have time.

7980
07:12:39,250 --> 07:12:40,570
I still have time.

7981
07:12:42,090 --> 07:12:43,830
Guys, I still have time.

7982
07:12:44,390 --> 07:12:46,230
Did you forgot the goal?

7983
07:12:46,690 --> 07:12:47,230
Oh my god.

7984
07:12:47,230 --> 07:12:48,890
I saw a child get shot.

7985
07:12:49,010 --> 07:12:49,750
I don't know.

7986
07:12:50,750 --> 07:12:52,290
Guys, they're still batting.

7987
07:12:52,370 --> 07:12:53,290
We have time.

7988
07:12:53,630 --> 07:12:55,290
Oh my god, a million dollars.

7989
07:12:55,510 --> 07:12:56,130
Let's go.

7990
07:12:56,850 --> 07:12:58,130
They're still batting.

7991
07:12:58,210 --> 07:13:00,250
They're batting the second character now.

7992
07:13:01,410 --> 07:13:02,110
I still have time.

7993
07:13:03,270 --> 07:13:04,090
Oh, wait.

7994
07:13:04,250 --> 07:13:04,910
What does that mean?

7995
07:13:05,470 --> 07:13:06,430
Wait, what does that mean?

7996
07:13:06,890 --> 07:13:08,030
What does that mean?

7997
07:13:09,750 --> 07:13:10,530
Do I still have time?

7998
07:13:11,290 --> 07:13:13,370
Yeah, they're doing the second band, guys.

7999
07:13:13,450 --> 07:13:14,530
We still have time.

8000
07:13:15,310 --> 07:13:17,110
Wait, I don't know what that means.

8001
07:13:17,290 --> 07:13:18,350
What are we doing?

8002
07:13:18,490 --> 07:13:20,010
What's gonna happen?

8003
07:13:23,230 --> 07:13:24,730
We still have time, guys.

8004
07:13:24,810 --> 07:13:25,650
We have four seconds.

8005
07:13:25,750 --> 07:13:26,530
We still have time.

8006
07:13:28,310 --> 07:13:29,310
What's going on?

8007
07:13:30,990 --> 07:13:31,730
I picked my hero.

8008
07:13:31,850 --> 07:13:32,990
I said 25 seconds.

8009
07:13:37,070 --> 07:13:38,870
I'm so scared.

8010
07:13:39,650 --> 07:13:41,010
I'm so scared.

8011
07:13:41,010 --> 07:13:41,170
I'm so scared.

8012
07:13:42,950 --> 07:13:44,730
2, 1.

8013
07:13:45,530 --> 07:13:45,770
Oh.

8014
07:13:46,410 --> 07:13:47,550
Wait, everything's okay.

8015
07:13:48,070 --> 07:13:48,690
What happened?

8016
07:13:50,030 --> 07:13:51,290
What happened?

8017
07:13:51,670 --> 07:13:52,670
What's going on?

8018
07:13:54,230 --> 07:13:55,850
Alright, are we attack or defense?

8019
07:13:56,610 --> 07:13:59,610
This is gonna decide whether or not I keep going.

8020
07:14:00,850 --> 07:14:02,190
Oh, I'm sorry.

8021
07:14:02,770 --> 07:14:03,070
Oh.

8022
07:14:03,870 --> 07:14:05,970
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

8023
07:14:07,610 --> 07:14:08,990
Oh my god.

8024
07:14:08,990 --> 07:14:10,510
Please, we gotta...

8025
07:14:10,510 --> 07:14:13,470
I gotta...

8026
07:14:13,470 --> 07:14:14,630
Oh, we're attacking.

8027
07:14:14,830 --> 07:14:15,410
We're fine.

8028
07:14:15,970 --> 07:14:16,670
We're attacking.

8029
07:14:17,070 --> 07:14:18,230
We're attacking.

8030
07:14:18,370 --> 07:14:19,310
We're so okay.

8031
07:14:19,990 --> 07:14:21,010
We're attacking.

8032
07:14:22,270 --> 07:14:23,230
Oh my god.

8033
07:14:23,410 --> 07:14:24,050
I'm sorry.

8034
07:14:24,170 --> 07:14:25,190
You guys are gonna lose.

8035
07:14:25,710 --> 07:14:27,050
I'm sorry, children.

8036
07:14:29,870 --> 07:14:30,590
I'm...

8037
07:14:30,590 --> 07:14:32,130
I'm sorry.

8038
07:14:32,490 --> 07:14:33,650
I'm sorry.

8039
07:14:33,870 --> 07:14:35,230
They gotta push him out of me.

8040
07:14:35,610 --> 07:14:36,590
I'm sorry.

8041
07:14:38,170 --> 07:14:39,370
I'm sorry.

8042
07:14:39,710 --> 07:14:39,970
I'm sorry, kids.

8043
07:14:40,570 --> 07:14:41,470
I'm sorry.

8044
07:14:42,350 --> 07:14:44,650
You left the kids out.

8045
07:14:45,430 --> 07:14:45,990
I'm sorry.

8046
07:14:46,170 --> 07:14:47,670
We're not in queue anymore.

8047
07:14:48,710 --> 07:14:49,110
That's fine.

8048
07:14:49,170 --> 07:14:50,390
I skate, so I go fast.

8049
07:14:53,270 --> 07:14:56,270
You left the kids to die.

8050
07:14:59,130 --> 07:15:00,490
Not intentionally.

8051
07:15:01,510 --> 07:15:05,870
Look, what are the kids gonna do with a million dollars, guys?

8052
07:15:06,990 --> 07:15:12,790
What the fuck are they gonna do with a million dollars, guys?

8053
07:15:13,850 --> 07:15:14,790
Legitimately.

8054
07:15:15,350 --> 07:15:16,870
What are they gonna do?

8055
07:15:18,530 --> 07:15:19,890
They don't...

8056
07:15:19,890 --> 07:15:23,450
The children don't need the million dollars.

8057
07:15:24,330 --> 07:15:26,310
The children are fat.

8058
07:15:28,950 --> 07:15:32,750
The children will be fat.

8059
07:15:37,600 --> 07:15:38,180
Oh my god.

8060
07:15:39,500 --> 07:15:43,780
I hear so many noises and I'm getting scared.

8061
07:15:44,420 --> 07:15:46,460
I hear so many sounds.

8062
07:15:48,640 --> 07:15:51,540
I was still fighting them.

8063
07:15:52,660 --> 07:15:53,460
Wait, change, change, change.

8064
07:15:54,600 --> 07:15:55,840
Change is low, change is low.

8065
07:15:58,040 --> 07:15:59,460
Wait, Magneto on point.

8066
07:16:02,840 --> 07:16:04,220
Oh my god.

8067
07:16:06,520 --> 07:16:09,340
What would these kids do with a million dollars?

8068
07:16:09,780 --> 07:16:12,100
Guys, what the fuck are they gonna do?

8069
07:16:15,260 --> 07:16:17,260
Legitimately, it got like...

8070
07:16:17,260 --> 07:16:18,880
Did Legitimately get like recalled?

8071
07:16:23,840 --> 07:16:25,100
Legitimately got recalled.

8072
07:16:28,930 --> 07:16:31,130
Kids don't know what to do with a million dollars.

8073
07:16:31,270 --> 07:16:32,590
You wanna know what I know?

8074
07:16:32,670 --> 07:16:33,890
Cause I didn't know what to do.

8075
07:16:34,470 --> 07:16:36,450
No, wait, I say that to my dad.

8076
07:16:36,750 --> 07:16:40,770
Cause I wouldn't know what to do if I was a child with a million dollars.

8077
07:16:47,140 --> 07:16:51,140
No, I'm saying hypothetically.

8078
07:16:54,260 --> 07:16:55,060
Wait, what?

8079
07:16:57,240 --> 07:16:58,440
What's going on?

8080
07:17:03,050 --> 07:17:06,710
What's going on?

8081
07:17:08,310 --> 07:17:08,630
What?

8082
07:17:11,830 --> 07:17:14,070
I'm coming back, guys.

8083
07:17:19,240 --> 07:17:21,000
What happened?

8084
07:17:27,250 --> 07:17:37,130
Oh my god, like, okay, the reason why the cheese were moldy is cause they said they didn't put any preservatives and because they didn't put any preservatives, like...

8085
07:17:37,130 --> 07:17:38,610
We're in the wrong spot, we're in the wrong spot, we're in the wrong spot.

8086
07:17:46,810 --> 07:17:50,390
We're in the wrong spot!

8087
07:17:52,590 --> 07:17:55,370
Okay, that was pretty funny.

8088
07:17:55,990 --> 07:17:57,450
That's really funny.

8089
07:17:58,830 --> 07:18:02,490
We actually ended up on the wrong spot.

8090
07:18:04,290 --> 07:18:08,810
That's like, not gonna lie, that's so impressive for us.

8091
07:18:13,270 --> 07:18:18,090
Oh, I didn't know where that was.

8092
07:18:20,630 --> 07:18:21,450
That was great.

8093
07:18:21,710 --> 07:18:23,330
That's actually crazy.

8094
07:18:23,330 --> 07:18:23,750
That's actually crazy.

8095
07:18:27,970 --> 07:18:33,490
I can't believe we were at the wrong spot.

8096
07:18:33,850 --> 07:18:34,890
It was a throw on me?

8097
07:18:34,950 --> 07:18:35,350
Thank you.

8098
07:18:37,150 --> 07:18:38,990
You didn't see us go to the wrong spot, right?

8099
07:18:39,630 --> 07:18:40,330
No, no.

8100
07:18:41,550 --> 07:18:42,930
No, no.

8101
07:18:44,070 --> 07:18:45,270
I died.

8102
07:18:45,790 --> 07:18:49,050
Yeah, yeah, I was with her.

8103
07:18:49,050 --> 07:18:50,110
Magneto.

8104
07:18:50,150 --> 07:18:51,830
It's Gomez's fault.

8105
07:18:51,970 --> 07:18:53,870
We were just walking for a spawn.

8106
07:18:53,990 --> 07:18:54,370
We died.

8107
07:18:54,410 --> 07:18:55,410
We were just resetting.

8108
07:18:55,790 --> 07:18:57,670
I was keeping up with my team.

8109
07:18:58,090 --> 07:18:59,010
Bye, guys.

8110
07:18:59,650 --> 07:19:03,530
Of course not.

8111
07:19:04,470 --> 07:19:09,430
I can't believe we were at the wrong spot.

8112
07:19:09,430 --> 07:19:13,850
We were capping our own spawn, but we still won.

8113
07:19:13,950 --> 07:19:14,770
Like, how?

8114
07:19:15,330 --> 07:19:16,810
That's freaking crazy.

8115
07:19:19,050 --> 07:19:20,370
We were at our own spawn.

8116
07:19:23,670 --> 07:19:24,190
Skill.

8117
07:19:24,510 --> 07:19:25,050
You're right.

8118
07:19:25,350 --> 07:19:26,250
It's pure skill.

8119
07:19:26,410 --> 07:19:26,930
That's how.

8120
07:19:27,610 --> 07:19:28,850
We take those, guys.

8121
07:19:29,030 --> 07:19:30,550
We fucking take those.

8122
07:19:34,450 --> 07:19:34,970
Yay.

8123
07:19:37,770 --> 07:19:39,550
They're gonna need to sleep in a restraining order?

8124
07:19:39,810 --> 07:19:42,030
For some reason, they won't do it again tomorrow.

8125
07:19:42,830 --> 07:19:48,110
I don't know if that's Stockholm Syndrome or, like, I made new friends.

8126
07:19:48,830 --> 07:19:50,630
You guys think I'm their friend?

8127
07:19:51,370 --> 07:19:52,770
Or do you think they're really tilted?

8128
07:19:53,650 --> 07:19:56,370
I don't know about Carrova.

8129
07:19:57,870 --> 07:20:01,190
I might be the worst support player he's ever played with, but, like, maybe...

8130
07:20:03,150 --> 07:20:05,550
There's a Thor and a Psylocke behind us.

8131
07:20:07,450 --> 07:20:07,750
Please.

8132
07:20:08,610 --> 07:20:09,090
Please!

8133
07:20:09,850 --> 07:20:10,710
Help me!

8134
07:20:18,200 --> 07:20:19,880
There are no friends.

8135
07:20:20,100 --> 07:20:20,760
Only rank.

8136
07:20:20,840 --> 07:20:21,660
True, true.

8137
07:20:25,820 --> 07:20:27,440
I'm coming back.

8138
07:20:28,920 --> 07:20:36,100
I'm coming back.

8139
07:20:40,240 --> 07:20:42,280
I froze him?

8140
07:20:45,950 --> 07:20:46,810
Nice.

8141
07:20:47,930 --> 07:20:48,790
Yay!

8142
07:21:00,660 --> 07:21:10,400
I sit in a 30-minute queue to be placed with 3 GFs.

8143
07:21:12,740 --> 07:21:14,160
That's rough, buddy.

8144
07:21:14,540 --> 07:21:16,020
That's so fucking rough.

8145
07:21:20,060 --> 07:21:21,400
That's pretty rough, man.

8146
07:21:22,300 --> 07:21:23,860
It's actually pretty rough.

8147
07:21:26,620 --> 07:21:27,800
You think they'll be okay?

8148
07:21:29,500 --> 07:21:30,360
Oh, shit.

8149
07:21:31,180 --> 07:21:31,520
Alright.

8150
07:21:34,740 --> 07:21:35,700
That'll be fine, right?

8151
07:21:35,900 --> 07:21:37,160
We're gonna be so healthy.

8152
07:21:37,840 --> 07:21:39,640
Fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear.

8153
07:21:40,380 --> 07:21:40,800
Whoa!

8154
07:21:41,440 --> 07:21:42,840
Fear, fear, fear, fear.

8155
07:21:43,220 --> 07:21:44,240
Fear, fear, fear.

8156
07:21:46,440 --> 07:21:47,700
Fear, fear, fear.

8157
07:21:47,700 --> 07:21:47,760
Fear, fear, fear.

8158
07:21:47,940 --> 07:21:48,580
There we go.

8159
07:21:49,920 --> 07:21:51,580
Don't worry, I'll body block!

8160
07:21:52,380 --> 07:21:55,400
It'll be so funny if I put it on damage right now.

8161
07:21:55,580 --> 07:21:58,260
It'll be so silly.

8162
07:22:01,460 --> 07:22:02,980
Oh my god!

8163
07:22:06,200 --> 07:22:07,800
I jumped up!

8164
07:22:15,300 --> 07:22:15,940
How?!

8165
07:22:16,920 --> 07:22:18,920
I jumped out of it!

8166
07:22:24,250 --> 07:22:24,890
How?!

8167
07:22:26,690 --> 07:22:27,330
How?!

8168
07:22:27,330 --> 07:22:28,490
Oh my god!

8169
07:22:28,570 --> 07:22:29,410
You're alive!

8170
07:22:29,710 --> 07:22:30,690
You're alive!

8171
07:22:37,110 --> 07:22:38,890
I hope they start taking damage.

8172
07:22:40,150 --> 07:22:41,070
Not me!

8173
07:22:41,290 --> 07:22:41,970
But not me!

8174
07:22:42,150 --> 07:22:42,730
Not me!

8175
07:22:42,790 --> 07:22:43,770
No, I didn't mean it!

8176
07:22:44,410 --> 07:22:48,620
We did it!

8177
07:22:52,380 --> 07:22:53,800
It's a thing!

8178
07:22:54,240 --> 07:22:57,080
Yeah, I'm so glad our game was shorter than our queue time.

8179
07:22:57,320 --> 07:22:59,260
That was fun.

8180
07:23:00,660 --> 07:23:02,240
Not for me.

8181
07:23:03,360 --> 07:23:04,240
I had a great time.

8182
07:23:09,060 --> 07:23:11,900
Now back to the Shrimp Game.

8183
07:23:12,500 --> 07:23:15,680
Alright, guys, now we can go back to Shrimp Game.

8184
07:23:18,640 --> 07:23:18,980
Yay!

8185
07:23:20,800 --> 07:23:24,380
I'm gonna use the bathroom before we play more Shrimp Game.

8186
07:23:24,800 --> 07:23:25,420
I'll be right back.

8187
07:24:26,930 --> 07:24:28,570
Time for the main event.

8188
07:24:31,450 --> 07:24:32,650
Time for...

8189
07:24:32,650 --> 07:24:34,490
Back to the main event, guys.

8190
07:24:35,390 --> 07:24:36,830
Back to the main event.

8191
07:24:36,910 --> 07:24:38,230
Let me boot it up real quick.

8192
07:24:38,870 --> 07:24:40,470
Alright, opening...

8193
07:24:40,470 --> 07:24:41,450
Opening it up.

8194
07:24:42,610 --> 07:24:43,390
It's time.

8195
07:24:45,250 --> 07:24:47,970
I'm sorry to the kids I ditched last time.

8196
07:24:48,730 --> 07:24:50,010
I'm so sorry.

8197
07:24:50,250 --> 07:24:52,150
To the children I ditched.

8198
07:24:53,770 --> 07:24:55,130
I'm really sorry.

8199
07:24:55,710 --> 07:24:57,350
I think they might have lost.

8200
07:24:59,510 --> 07:25:01,770
It's okay, we can do this all over again.

8201
07:25:03,090 --> 07:25:05,010
How do you make a private lobby?

8202
07:25:05,390 --> 07:25:06,810
We'll make a private lobby next time.

8203
07:25:10,010 --> 07:25:10,710
It's okay.

8204
07:25:10,830 --> 07:25:11,410
Oh, you're right!

8205
07:25:11,450 --> 07:25:13,150
They can't feel anything because they're dead now.

8206
07:25:13,390 --> 07:25:13,910
You're right.

8207
07:25:14,150 --> 07:25:14,770
That's great.

8208
07:25:14,770 --> 07:25:16,470
That's great to know.

8209
07:25:18,150 --> 07:25:20,410
Wait, I need VIP?

8210
07:25:21,070 --> 07:25:22,030
That's money.

8211
07:25:22,710 --> 07:25:24,730
Fucking Rivals doesn't even sponsor me.

8212
07:25:24,770 --> 07:25:25,970
You think I have the money?

8213
07:25:26,370 --> 07:25:29,250
I'm fucking grinding the game for free right now.

8214
07:25:32,810 --> 07:25:34,570
You don't need VIP?

8215
07:25:35,010 --> 07:25:35,550
I don't?

8216
07:25:35,670 --> 07:25:36,650
Okay, how do I do it then?

8217
07:25:41,090 --> 07:25:41,650
Uh...

8218
07:25:41,650 --> 07:25:43,450
Thank you for the Twitch Prime!

8219
07:25:43,450 --> 07:25:45,510
Thank you for the Twitch Prime!

8220
07:25:45,670 --> 07:25:46,290
Thank you, thank you.

8221
07:25:46,350 --> 07:25:46,870
Oh, nice.

8222
07:25:47,430 --> 07:25:47,790
Nice.

8223
07:25:51,050 --> 07:25:51,530
Um...

8224
07:25:53,730 --> 07:25:54,210
Um...

8225
07:25:54,210 --> 07:25:55,570
Come on, start the game.

8226
07:25:56,370 --> 07:25:57,530
Start the game, I'm ready.

8227
07:25:59,310 --> 07:26:00,430
I'm fucking ready.

8228
07:26:01,310 --> 07:26:03,690
I'm the- Yeah, I've played these games before!

8229
07:26:08,790 --> 07:26:10,590
I've played these games before.

8230
07:26:11,750 --> 07:26:13,850
I know how it happens.

8231
07:26:16,850 --> 07:26:18,110
Alright, I'm ready.

8232
07:26:20,490 --> 07:26:24,390
Okay, I need to get out of this part.

8233
07:26:39,050 --> 07:26:39,850
Okay.

8234
07:26:39,850 --> 07:26:44,370
I'd like to extend a heartfelt welcome to you all.

8235
07:26:45,510 --> 07:26:50,710
Everyone here will participate in the six different games over six days.

8236
07:26:51,910 --> 07:26:52,410
Where are they?

8237
07:26:53,830 --> 07:26:54,210
Okay.

8238
07:26:55,090 --> 07:26:55,470
Alright.

8239
07:26:59,120 --> 07:27:01,180
Bro, do you think I'm gonna save the other people?

8240
07:27:01,280 --> 07:27:02,820
I'm gonna fucking...

8241
07:27:03,260 --> 07:27:11,280
I love the newest trend for like there are a lot of people playing these squid game type games like Call of Duty and Fortnite and Roblox and they do like a soundboard.

8242
07:27:11,800 --> 07:27:14,180
They do a- I'm fucking- I'm not- I don't trust them.

8243
07:27:14,340 --> 07:27:15,620
No, I got a game!

8244
07:27:16,380 --> 07:27:18,280
Okay, I'm gonna push somebody down before.

8245
07:27:19,840 --> 07:27:20,980
Before this happens.

8246
07:27:20,980 --> 07:27:22,260
I'll push someone down.

8247
07:27:22,900 --> 07:27:23,640
How do I push people?

8248
07:27:24,360 --> 07:27:25,580
Guys, how do I push people down?

8249
07:27:26,060 --> 07:27:26,940
Before I die?

8250
07:27:30,020 --> 07:27:31,560
Guys, how do I do it?

8251
07:27:32,380 --> 07:27:33,340
Guys, how do I do it?

8252
07:27:33,800 --> 07:27:35,860
Guys, I need you to teach me.

8253
07:27:43,980 --> 07:27:44,560
It's a P?

8254
07:27:44,780 --> 07:27:45,360
I'm gonna do it.

8255
07:27:46,840 --> 07:27:47,760
It's not P!

8256
07:27:48,040 --> 07:27:48,820
You guys lied!

8257
07:27:49,680 --> 07:27:51,220
You guys lied!

8258
07:27:54,500 --> 07:27:57,200
Push is a VIP feature?!

8259
07:27:57,200 --> 07:27:58,020
What's the point?

8260
07:27:58,580 --> 07:27:59,480
What's the point?

8261
07:28:01,320 --> 07:28:02,800
It's literally...

8262
07:28:02,800 --> 07:28:04,060
It's literally P!

8263
07:28:04,200 --> 07:28:06,300
Oh my god!

8264
07:28:06,680 --> 07:28:08,560
What the fuck?!

8265
07:28:08,560 --> 07:28:09,580
Holy shit!

8266
07:28:12,700 --> 07:28:15,780
He went back just to push me!

8267
07:28:18,820 --> 07:28:19,560
Holy shit!

8268
07:28:20,600 --> 07:28:25,760
He fucking walked back just to push me!

8269
07:28:28,360 --> 07:28:30,420
He looked at me!

8270
07:28:30,840 --> 07:28:38,200
Oh my god!

8271
07:28:39,440 --> 07:28:41,260
Okay, we gotta leave again.

8272
07:28:41,760 --> 07:28:42,920
We gotta leave.

8273
07:28:43,100 --> 07:28:44,900
The pro is gone.

8274
07:28:46,440 --> 07:28:48,060
Oh my god!

8275
07:28:48,060 --> 07:28:50,400
The force of that shot!

8276
07:28:51,320 --> 07:28:52,000
Bro!

8277
07:28:52,260 --> 07:28:57,160
Fuck that one guy that turned around just to push me down!

8278
07:28:57,540 --> 07:29:01,400
Like, what's wrong with him?!

8279
07:29:01,400 --> 07:29:03,540
Oh my god!

8280
07:29:04,040 --> 07:29:07,040
What the fuck was wrong with him?!

8281
07:29:07,040 --> 07:29:07,540
Karma!

8282
07:29:09,100 --> 07:29:10,900
Bro, that's so...

8283
07:29:11,500 --> 07:29:12,620
Yeah, true.

8284
07:29:14,000 --> 07:29:14,580
Alright.

8285
07:29:16,940 --> 07:29:18,180
Alright, here we go.

8286
07:29:21,340 --> 07:29:22,880
Alright, here we go.

8287
07:29:23,280 --> 07:29:23,860
Alright!

8288
07:29:26,040 --> 07:29:28,860
No, they have...

8289
07:29:28,860 --> 07:29:29,960
They have the...

8290
07:29:29,960 --> 07:29:31,400
Top 10 squad again.

8291
07:29:32,040 --> 07:29:33,520
The top 10 stack.

8292
07:29:33,880 --> 07:29:35,440
The 4 stacking top 10s.

8293
07:29:35,820 --> 07:29:36,580
You know that guy?

8294
07:29:36,700 --> 07:29:37,660
You know the top 10 stack?

8295
07:29:37,920 --> 07:29:41,460
You know, with 4 people in that stack that were trying for top 10?

8296
07:29:41,760 --> 07:29:42,880
You know, those guys?

8297
07:29:43,260 --> 07:29:43,880
The top 10?

8298
07:29:45,400 --> 07:29:46,160
What were they again?

8299
07:29:50,920 --> 07:29:51,860
The what?

8300
07:29:55,480 --> 07:29:57,080
What were they?

8301
07:29:57,520 --> 07:29:59,200
The potion for Kuzco?

8302
07:30:10,180 --> 07:30:11,100
I'm gonna grab Tringe.

8303
07:30:11,320 --> 07:30:12,000
I got Tringe.

8304
07:30:16,020 --> 07:30:17,000
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.

8305
07:30:19,560 --> 07:30:20,720
Oh my god!

8306
07:30:21,300 --> 07:30:22,260
Alright, my passive got popped.

8307
07:30:23,260 --> 07:30:24,160
Wait, wait, wait.

8308
07:30:24,920 --> 07:30:28,340
I got grabbed.

8309
07:30:30,940 --> 07:30:31,960
Who did he grab?

8310
07:30:34,300 --> 07:30:35,020
Let me tell you.

8311
07:30:35,440 --> 07:30:37,020
I need to grab again.

8312
07:30:37,020 --> 07:30:37,840
Oh.

8313
07:30:39,340 --> 07:30:40,500
You'll be fine, right?

8314
07:30:50,500 --> 07:30:52,120
Alright, oh shit!

8315
07:30:56,380 --> 07:30:58,400
Oh my god, oh my god!

8316
07:31:02,700 --> 07:31:03,960
I'm never okay.

8317
07:31:04,980 --> 07:31:06,560
I'm never fucking okay.

8318
07:31:08,440 --> 07:31:09,880
I should stop damage boosting.

8319
07:31:10,020 --> 07:31:10,440
I should just heal.

8320
07:31:11,020 --> 07:31:12,240
I'm not getting a lot of...

8321
07:31:12,240 --> 07:31:14,000
Ult charge from it.

8322
07:31:16,760 --> 07:31:17,880
This person got...

8323
07:31:17,880 --> 07:31:18,820
They got a lot of ult charge.

8324
07:31:22,460 --> 07:31:24,300
I need to heal more.

8325
07:31:25,900 --> 07:31:27,980
So I can grab ult charge for it.

8326
07:31:34,230 --> 07:31:35,530
Oh my god!

8327
07:31:35,570 --> 07:31:37,990
I tried my best to keep him up.

8328
07:31:38,730 --> 07:31:43,070
Like, I actually tried so hard to keep him up there.

8329
07:31:48,080 --> 07:31:48,920
Oh my god!

8330
07:31:48,920 --> 07:31:49,420
What the fuck?

8331
07:31:50,220 --> 07:31:51,720
Oh my god!

8332
07:31:52,900 --> 07:31:56,420
Tried so hard and got so far.

8333
07:32:04,920 --> 07:32:07,260
I think I'm like...

8334
07:32:07,700 --> 07:32:09,060
I think like...

8335
07:32:10,940 --> 07:32:14,600
The shrimp game, like actually locked me out.

8336
07:32:17,060 --> 07:32:17,380
What?

8337
07:32:19,860 --> 07:32:21,200
Oh my god.

8338
07:32:24,600 --> 07:32:26,480
There's a Hulk behind you.

8339
07:32:32,100 --> 07:32:33,140
He's low, he's low.

8340
07:32:34,140 --> 07:32:35,340
Oh, nice.

8341
07:32:38,640 --> 07:32:40,000
Oh no!

8342
07:32:40,320 --> 07:32:40,600
I quit!

8343
07:32:43,570 --> 07:32:44,690
I quit!

8344
07:32:45,030 --> 07:32:45,230
Oh!

8345
07:32:45,850 --> 07:32:46,330
It's fine.

8346
07:32:46,330 --> 07:32:47,310
It was planned.

8347
07:32:48,350 --> 07:32:50,090
It was planned.

8348
07:32:52,350 --> 07:32:53,710
Okay, you guys can live.

8349
07:32:53,870 --> 07:32:54,750
I'm gonna ult.

8350
07:32:58,850 --> 07:33:02,230
Oh, I got you.

8351
07:33:02,310 --> 07:33:02,890
I'm gonna ult for you.

8352
07:33:04,090 --> 07:33:05,350
Oh my god.

8353
07:33:10,750 --> 07:33:12,030
No way!

8354
07:33:12,030 --> 07:33:12,290
No way!

8355
07:33:13,890 --> 07:33:15,730
Oh my god!

8356
07:33:17,970 --> 07:33:21,450
The supports are getting so fucking harassed right now.

8357
07:33:21,590 --> 07:33:22,790
Holy shit.

8358
07:33:23,730 --> 07:33:25,890
Oh my god!

8359
07:33:26,570 --> 07:33:28,210
Guys, I don't...

8360
07:33:28,210 --> 07:33:28,910
They're all red.

8361
07:33:29,270 --> 07:33:30,110
I'm scared.

8362
07:33:30,730 --> 07:33:31,950
I'm so scared.

8363
07:33:35,820 --> 07:33:36,850
I'm trying!

8364
07:33:37,390 --> 07:33:43,950
Oh my god!

8365
07:33:44,250 --> 07:33:48,010
I'm trying so hard to keep people up.

8366
07:33:51,190 --> 07:33:53,590
Are they still alive?

8367
07:33:54,450 --> 07:33:54,870
How?

8368
07:33:55,410 --> 07:33:57,130
How do I not be...

8369
07:33:57,130 --> 07:33:59,350
I can't fucking go inside.

8370
07:34:03,390 --> 07:34:04,550
Wolverine's low!

8371
07:34:09,150 --> 07:34:10,510
He has no passive.

8372
07:34:14,090 --> 07:34:15,530
Oh my god.

8373
07:34:24,770 --> 07:34:25,790
I'm scared.

8374
07:34:29,630 --> 07:34:30,950
I'm like the weak link here.

8375
07:34:31,130 --> 07:34:31,650
Please stop.

8376
07:34:33,010 --> 07:34:33,870
Please stop.

8377
07:34:33,990 --> 07:34:35,250
Oh my god!

8378
07:34:36,370 --> 07:34:38,790
We're trying to save your life!

8379
07:34:38,950 --> 07:34:40,410
Oh my god!

8380
07:34:41,370 --> 07:34:43,250
I slept somebody.

8381
07:34:44,310 --> 07:34:48,990
Hulk is behind us.

8382
07:34:51,170 --> 07:34:51,910
Bro!

8383
07:34:52,170 --> 07:34:52,590
Stop!

8384
07:34:52,690 --> 07:34:53,170
I can't see!

8385
07:34:55,910 --> 07:34:56,350
Oh my god.

8386
07:34:56,710 --> 07:34:57,130
Wolverine!

8387
07:34:57,990 --> 07:35:01,910
Oh my god.

8388
07:35:05,410 --> 07:35:06,990
Boom, boom, boom.

8389
07:35:09,010 --> 07:35:10,650
I'm so sad.

8390
07:35:12,070 --> 07:35:13,290
Oh shit!

8391
07:35:19,630 --> 07:35:21,850
I can go up here for us.

8392
07:35:22,510 --> 07:35:24,370
I'm punching a cap off!

8393
07:35:26,810 --> 07:35:27,390
Hulk is low!

8394
07:35:27,410 --> 07:35:27,850
Hulk is one!

8395
07:35:33,070 --> 07:35:34,110
Oh nice!

8396
07:35:37,490 --> 07:35:38,890
Oh my god.

8397
07:35:39,210 --> 07:35:41,410
I can't move!

8398
07:35:44,010 --> 07:35:44,390
Alright.

8399
07:35:44,650 --> 07:35:45,310
Everything's fine.

8400
07:35:45,670 --> 07:35:46,710
I'm having a great time.

8401
07:35:47,070 --> 07:35:48,850
I fucking love eternity games, guys.

8402
07:35:49,050 --> 07:35:50,990
No, this isn't even an eternity game.

8403
07:35:51,050 --> 07:35:52,870
I'm up against a top 10 stack.

8404
07:35:53,030 --> 07:35:53,790
This is fucked.

8405
07:35:54,310 --> 07:35:58,430
I'm not even top 500 and I have to play against them.

8406
07:35:58,430 --> 07:35:59,730
Like, what's wrong?

8407
07:36:06,550 --> 07:36:09,950
I'm in this shit, baby!

8408
07:36:11,730 --> 07:36:15,830
Oh my god.

8409
07:36:17,050 --> 07:36:23,230
Oh nice!

8410
07:36:26,630 --> 07:36:27,590
Oh my god.

8411
07:36:27,590 --> 07:36:29,070
Awesome, thank you for the raid, Blurred!

8412
07:36:29,110 --> 07:36:30,410
Thank you, thank you!

8413
07:36:31,350 --> 07:36:32,310
Thank you!

8414
07:36:32,550 --> 07:36:33,810
Thank you for the raid.

8415
07:36:33,910 --> 07:36:34,630
Hello, everybody!

8416
07:36:36,030 --> 07:36:38,170
If you're new here, my name is Doki Bird.

8417
07:36:38,290 --> 07:36:42,250
I usually stream on YouTube, but I'm here suffering in rank.

8418
07:36:43,210 --> 07:36:45,450
Oh my god, why are they stuck?

8419
07:36:45,770 --> 07:36:47,050
You came second.

8420
07:36:48,910 --> 07:36:52,450
But yes, please check me out on YouTube if you like my content.

8421
07:36:53,170 --> 07:36:57,390
In three days, I'll be back on- On three days, I'll be back on YouTube.

8422
07:36:57,630 --> 07:37:06,190
I'm just- I'm just trying my best in Marvel Rivals ranked to see if I can get a top 500, and yet I'm fighting against top 10s right now.

8423
07:37:06,550 --> 07:37:09,730
I keep fighting against top 10s at the moment.

8424
07:37:13,690 --> 07:37:15,390
It's actually crazy.

8425
07:37:16,050 --> 07:37:17,710
These guys are fucking insane.

8426
07:37:17,710 --> 07:37:21,030
I'm fighting for my goddamn life right now.

8427
07:37:23,930 --> 07:37:32,970
I swear, I'll return back to normal in- I'll return back to normal in three days when this is all over.

8428
07:37:34,910 --> 07:37:35,410
You're right.

8429
07:37:35,610 --> 07:37:41,010
I'll either get top 500, or I'm gonna break every pro in my way.

8430
07:37:42,870 --> 07:37:45,870
They'll be like, let's play with Doki Bird!

8431
07:37:45,870 --> 07:37:47,210
She has clout!

8432
07:37:47,730 --> 07:37:49,590
And she's like, she seems really funny.

8433
07:37:51,110 --> 07:37:58,550
And then they don't realize they don't realize the fine print when it comes to playing with me.

8434
07:37:59,910 --> 07:38:02,890
It's not as fun as you think it is!

8435
07:38:03,250 --> 07:38:03,410
It's-

8436
07:38:07,030 --> 07:38:12,950
It's not- It's not- It's not as easy!

8437
07:38:16,410 --> 07:38:17,110
I'm good.

8438
07:38:17,430 --> 07:38:22,990
Oh my god.

8439
07:38:24,230 --> 07:38:24,750
Woah!

8440
07:38:25,210 --> 07:38:26,210
There's a Wolverine on us!

8441
07:38:26,650 --> 07:38:27,070
In the back.

8442
07:38:27,970 --> 07:38:29,390
I'm getting into mass, I'm getting busy.

8443
07:38:29,670 --> 07:38:30,250
Come here, Mantis!

8444
07:38:30,410 --> 07:38:30,870
What's up, bitch?

8445
07:38:31,550 --> 07:38:32,070
Okay.

8446
07:38:33,830 --> 07:38:34,350
Okay.

8447
07:38:36,330 --> 07:38:37,450
One-way ticket.

8448
07:38:38,070 --> 07:38:39,290
Oh my god, Wolverine's on top!

8449
07:38:39,950 --> 07:38:41,310
Wolverine behind, Wolverine behind.

8450
07:38:41,630 --> 07:38:42,050
Top right.

8451
07:38:43,550 --> 07:38:44,750
We're hiding here.

8452
07:38:44,930 --> 07:38:46,250
Yeah, we're about to get devious.

8453
07:38:46,570 --> 07:38:48,810
He's enjoying his load, Ganon.

8454
07:38:49,190 --> 07:38:49,390
No!

8455
07:38:50,590 --> 07:38:52,570
Wait, come on, come on.

8456
07:38:52,670 --> 07:38:53,830
We're coming over, we're coming over!

8457
07:38:54,190 --> 07:38:55,230
Okay, okay.

8458
07:38:55,770 --> 07:38:57,130
I'm coming in.

8459
07:38:58,410 --> 07:38:58,850
Yeah!

8460
07:39:02,090 --> 07:39:03,010
Wait, wait, strangers!

8461
07:39:03,330 --> 07:39:07,570
Strangers have- Strangers low, strangers low!

8462
07:39:07,630 --> 07:39:08,670
I'm gonna push the cart.

8463
07:39:09,270 --> 07:39:10,490
Oh my god, I'm one.

8464
07:39:11,930 --> 07:39:13,430
I'm pushing cart.

8465
07:39:17,370 --> 07:39:18,790
I got you!

8466
07:39:18,910 --> 07:39:19,610
Oh my god.

8467
07:39:23,050 --> 07:39:24,810
I can feel it.

8468
07:39:28,710 --> 07:39:30,630
I think you're dead.

8469
07:39:31,450 --> 07:39:32,110
Oh damn.

8470
07:39:35,650 --> 07:39:38,530
Oh my god, what's going on over there?

8471
07:39:38,670 --> 07:39:40,250
What's going on?

8472
07:39:42,210 --> 07:39:48,070
I'm just- There's a Hulk, that's a sneak.

8473
07:39:48,930 --> 07:39:50,450
Wait, I'll taxi you, I'll taxi you.

8474
07:39:51,150 --> 07:39:53,410
Oh, Hulk smash time!

8475
07:39:54,770 --> 07:39:57,530
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you.

8476
07:39:57,830 --> 07:39:59,350
You're gonna have strangers though.

8477
07:40:01,190 --> 07:40:04,210
Oh my god, what's going on?

8478
07:40:04,770 --> 07:40:05,450
Please!

8479
07:40:05,450 --> 07:40:05,490
Please!

8480
07:40:09,610 --> 07:40:10,230
Please!

8481
07:40:10,970 --> 07:40:13,730
Why is it always me?!

8482
07:40:13,730 --> 07:40:15,030
It's just me!

8483
07:40:20,190 --> 07:40:20,810
Wait,

8484
07:40:26,450 --> 07:40:27,670
wait, there's a Wolverine on spawn!

8485
07:40:27,930 --> 07:40:29,210
He's trying to spawncap me!

8486
07:40:35,450 --> 07:40:36,850
Oh my god!

8487
07:40:37,370 --> 07:40:38,050
The Wolverine's coming!

8488
07:40:47,310 --> 07:40:52,250
What the fuck is going on?!

8489
07:40:55,590 --> 07:40:57,750
Arts are only for doki.

8490
07:40:57,750 --> 07:40:57,990
Doki!

8491
07:41:04,430 --> 07:41:05,030
Yay!

8492
07:41:05,330 --> 07:41:07,590
We beat the top end team!

8493
07:41:07,890 --> 07:41:11,410
Thank - This is our first victory against them.

8494
07:41:14,850 --> 07:41:20,830
Every time I see a Wolverine, all I think of is like- Ba dum bum bum ba da dum!

8495
07:41:21,490 --> 07:41:23,630
Ba dum bum bum ba da dum!

8496
07:41:24,050 --> 07:41:25,530
Ba dum bum ba da dum!

8497
07:41:25,530 --> 07:41:26,870
Ba dum bum ba da dum!

8498
07:41:30,730 --> 07:41:32,970
Oh my god, my new peak!

8499
07:41:33,990 --> 07:41:48,130
Guys, for those who didn't see the- For those who- Who didn't see the video- That - That I sent of my favorite Wolverine meme- Is this.

8500
07:41:48,270 --> 07:41:51,090
This is literally my favorite Wolverine meme.

8501
07:41:52,450 --> 07:41:53,150
Oh!

8502
07:41:55,970 --> 07:41:58,830
My goal- Top 500.

8503
07:41:58,970 --> 07:42:00,850
270 should be the cutoff, I think.

8504
07:42:01,190 --> 07:42:03,150
It's like- Oh!

8505
07:42:04,670 --> 07:42:06,250
Ba dum bum ba da dum!

8506
07:42:06,490 --> 07:42:08,590
Ba dum bum ba da dum!

8507
07:42:09,470 --> 07:42:10,170
Animal!

8508
07:42:10,870 --> 07:42:11,350
Animal!

8509
07:42:11,990 --> 07:42:13,410
Animal, yeah!

8510
07:42:16,210 --> 07:42:20,150
I think 250- 250 or 270 could be the cutoff.

8511
07:42:20,150 --> 07:42:26,970
Because there's still- There is- 3 days left of the season.

8512
07:42:27,530 --> 07:42:29,790
And it's at 200 right now.

8513
07:42:31,370 --> 07:42:32,210
I love that video.

8514
07:42:32,310 --> 07:42:33,950
That video lives rent-free in my head.

8515
07:42:34,930 --> 07:42:38,770
It actually- Lives rent-free in my head.

8516
07:42:38,790 --> 07:42:40,250
Alright, back to the main event.

8517
07:42:41,010 --> 07:42:41,510
Guys.

8518
07:42:42,170 --> 07:42:44,170
Back to what we actually came here for.

8519
07:42:44,170 --> 07:42:56,390
Uh- Maybe- Maybe we'll finally get to- We'll finally make it to like- The third game.

8520
07:42:57,530 --> 07:42:58,230
Alright.

8521
07:42:58,530 --> 07:42:59,470
Opening it up.

8522
07:43:02,570 --> 07:43:03,490
Alright, it's time.

8523
07:43:03,670 --> 07:43:04,970
We're back at it again!

8524
07:43:05,310 --> 07:43:06,870
We're back at it again!

8525
07:43:07,530 --> 07:43:09,990
This time we'll make it to the third game!

8526
07:43:10,290 --> 07:43:11,150
I believe!

8527
07:43:14,790 --> 07:43:15,590
I believe!

8528
07:43:17,730 --> 07:43:18,130
I believe!

8529
07:43:18,130 --> 07:43:18,590
This is it.

8530
07:43:20,430 --> 07:43:22,670
We're back to- We're back to shrimp game.

8531
07:43:23,410 --> 07:43:25,030
We're gonna make it, I swear.

8532
07:43:26,110 --> 07:43:27,510
Wait, how much money do I have?

8533
07:43:29,810 --> 07:43:30,210
Okay.

8534
07:43:30,690 --> 07:43:32,830
How much money do I have in the shop, actually?

8535
07:43:33,270 --> 07:43:33,970
Is this a shop?

8536
07:43:34,910 --> 07:43:36,210
Oh my god, there it is!

8537
07:43:36,430 --> 07:43:37,970
Oh my god, I almost got it!

8538
07:43:37,970 --> 07:43:41,890
Alright guys, if I stop leaving after first game, I might be able to afford it.

8539
07:43:43,870 --> 07:43:44,910
Oh my god.

8540
07:43:45,190 --> 07:43:51,230
Wait, it only expires- Bro, that guy- Are you telling me that guy pushed me once?

8541
07:43:51,770 --> 07:43:54,010
That was an actual crime!

8542
07:43:54,690 --> 07:44:01,830
He- You can only use it once, and he used that one time to turn around and push me!

8543
07:44:02,290 --> 07:44:03,390
That's so fucked.

8544
07:44:03,870 --> 07:44:05,310
That's actually so fucked.

8545
07:44:05,310 --> 07:44:10,870
Oh my god, that's- I - This is a perfect representation of society.

8546
07:44:13,490 --> 07:44:17,030
You asked how and he showed you how.

8547
07:44:19,990 --> 07:44:25,520
It was- It was not racially motivated, it was fucking VTuber motivated.

8548
07:44:26,110 --> 07:44:26,530
He knew.

8549
07:44:26,790 --> 07:44:31,570
He knew I was a VTuber and he's like, only fleshies are allowed here.

8550
07:44:34,830 --> 07:44:37,150
Revenge for the mutants.

8551
07:44:37,870 --> 07:44:39,110
VTuber spotted.

8552
07:44:40,870 --> 07:44:41,490
Oh!

8553
07:44:42,770 --> 07:44:44,790
Fucking hate these PNGs.

8554
07:44:44,930 --> 07:44:48,470
That's right, those goddamn PNGs ruining my games.

8555
07:44:54,090 --> 07:45:01,150
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

8556
07:45:01,250 --> 07:45:02,130
Alright, here we go.

8557
07:45:03,930 --> 07:45:04,550
PNGs.

8558
07:45:04,550 --> 07:45:05,230
PNGmag.

8559
07:45:09,600 --> 07:45:10,160
Alright.

8560
07:45:13,570 --> 07:45:14,570
Here I go.

8561
07:45:15,310 --> 07:45:17,930
We are at almost the 8 hour mark now.

8562
07:45:18,250 --> 07:45:20,690
Alright, guys, I swear to god they pushed me.

8563
07:45:20,910 --> 07:45:22,350
I swear to fucking god.

8564
07:45:22,610 --> 07:45:25,050
Oh my god, they already got pushed?

8565
07:45:25,250 --> 07:45:27,450
The game hasn't even started yet!

8566
07:45:27,750 --> 07:45:29,850
I'm so scared, I'm so scared.

8567
07:45:30,710 --> 07:45:31,750
Don't push me.

8568
07:45:35,530 --> 07:45:40,130
Why are these gunshots so- I thought this Roblox was for kids.

8569
07:45:40,550 --> 07:45:43,030
Why are the gunshots so realistic?

8570
07:45:49,670 --> 07:45:52,030
I'm sorry if it's loud.

8571
07:45:52,890 --> 07:45:55,350
Oh my god.

8572
07:45:55,630 --> 07:45:57,490
Oh my god.

8573
07:45:58,910 --> 07:46:00,110
So many.

8574
07:46:00,770 --> 07:46:03,650
Oh my god.

8575
07:46:04,030 --> 07:46:06,590
There's so many people pushing.

8576
07:46:09,750 --> 07:46:10,970
My god.

8577
07:46:12,110 --> 07:46:12,990
He died?

8578
07:46:13,830 --> 07:46:15,570
He made it across!

8579
07:46:17,550 --> 07:46:20,030
How did he die?

8580
07:46:22,130 --> 07:46:25,570
He died after crossing.

8581
07:46:26,610 --> 07:46:27,070
Yay.

8582
07:46:28,010 --> 07:46:28,890
Oh my god.

8583
07:46:28,890 --> 07:46:31,390
Guys, I think I can afford it!

8584
07:46:31,710 --> 07:46:33,870
I can afford the push now!

8585
07:46:34,170 --> 07:46:35,410
I can push the children!

8586
07:46:37,130 --> 07:46:40,470
I need to give my ID to Roblox so I can hear the voice comms.

8587
07:46:40,510 --> 07:46:42,530
I hear the voice comms are like the funniest shit.

8588
07:46:43,070 --> 07:46:44,270
Okay, I'll show you guys.

8589
07:46:44,370 --> 07:46:55,830
I like the video of like- The only reason why I won't play this is that there was a video of these children playing this game and like, it goes so hard.

8590
07:46:56,070 --> 07:46:56,730
Did I like it?

8591
07:46:56,770 --> 07:46:57,650
I hope I liked it.

8592
07:46:57,890 --> 07:46:58,630
Oh, it's this.

8593
07:47:05,130 --> 07:47:06,050
It's this.

8594
07:47:06,530 --> 07:47:07,590
I think it's this.

8595
07:47:08,890 --> 07:47:09,650
There's no way.

8596
07:47:10,310 --> 07:47:11,170
Oh, thank god.

8597
07:47:12,570 --> 07:47:13,930
From the cookie.

8598
07:47:14,270 --> 07:47:17,050
That's why I really want to have voice comms on.

8599
07:47:22,080 --> 07:47:22,640
Alright.

8600
07:47:24,000 --> 07:47:24,560
Saved.

8601
07:47:30,000 --> 07:47:30,680
Alright.

8602
07:47:35,100 --> 07:47:35,780
Okay.

8603
07:47:36,300 --> 07:47:37,500
Okay, we're fine.

8604
07:47:38,640 --> 07:47:40,480
Everything will be fine.

8605
07:47:42,140 --> 07:47:44,360
Oh my god, why are they walking around?

8606
07:47:44,460 --> 07:47:45,780
I don't like that.

8607
07:47:46,100 --> 07:47:49,140
I don't like that they're walking around me.

8608
07:47:49,280 --> 07:47:50,960
This is so nerve wracking.

8609
07:47:57,200 --> 07:47:58,800
I'm sorry.

8610
07:48:02,360 --> 07:48:04,900
Not the Mona Lisa.

8611
07:48:09,980 --> 07:48:11,760
Yay, we did it.

8612
07:48:11,820 --> 07:48:12,820
We made it.

8613
07:48:13,200 --> 07:48:14,720
We made it.

8614
07:48:15,700 --> 07:48:16,780
The kids screamed.

8615
07:48:16,780 --> 07:48:17,800
That's what I'm saying.

8616
07:48:18,180 --> 07:48:22,420
I want voice comms on because the children screaming is so funny.

8617
07:48:22,540 --> 07:48:23,700
Okay, I'm sorry.

8618
07:48:23,780 --> 07:48:25,060
That's out of context.

8619
07:48:25,440 --> 07:48:26,780
But like...

8620
07:48:28,680 --> 07:48:30,280
Oh my god.

8621
07:48:31,320 --> 07:48:32,360
It's like...

8622
07:48:32,360 --> 07:48:33,920
I have a family!

8623
07:48:34,900 --> 07:48:35,560
Chants.

8624
07:48:41,700 --> 07:48:43,140
It's like...

8625
07:48:43,140 --> 07:48:45,940
I swear, children are such good actors now.

8626
07:48:46,300 --> 07:48:49,000
That kid screaming that he has a family.

8627
07:48:49,180 --> 07:48:51,700
I felt so immersed, guys.

8628
07:48:51,840 --> 07:48:53,040
It was so immersive.

8629
07:48:53,160 --> 07:48:54,180
I felt like I was there.

8630
07:48:54,580 --> 07:48:56,120
I felt like it was real.

8631
07:48:56,540 --> 07:48:58,080
It felt so fucking real.

8632
07:49:01,000 --> 07:49:03,740
That kid's gonna grow up as a voice actor.

8633
07:49:03,940 --> 07:49:04,740
I can feel it.

8634
07:49:05,460 --> 07:49:06,760
I can fucking feel it.

8635
07:49:07,960 --> 07:49:11,040
For those who missed it, the stakes are real.

8636
07:49:11,160 --> 07:49:14,320
It felt like the stakes were actually real there.

8637
07:49:17,120 --> 07:49:17,900
Alright.

8638
07:49:18,800 --> 07:49:20,500
Oh, it's the merry-go-round.

8639
07:49:25,480 --> 07:49:27,300
Which one's me?

8640
07:49:28,860 --> 07:49:30,320
Where am I?

8641
07:49:30,820 --> 07:49:32,480
Where am I?

8642
07:49:33,920 --> 07:49:34,520
Where am I?

8643
07:49:37,320 --> 07:49:39,700
I can't tell where I am!

8644
07:49:39,700 --> 07:49:41,460
I don't... wait, that's me.

8645
07:49:41,620 --> 07:49:42,140
I found me.

8646
07:49:42,280 --> 07:49:43,020
I'm like...

8647
07:49:43,020 --> 07:49:43,680
That's me!

8648
07:49:43,840 --> 07:49:44,280
That's me!

8649
07:49:50,140 --> 07:49:50,160
How?

8650
07:50:06,110 --> 07:50:06,390
How?

8651
07:50:09,110 --> 07:50:09,750
Get in!

8652
07:50:09,750 --> 07:50:10,350
Get in!

8653
07:50:11,250 --> 07:50:11,550
Friends!

8654
07:50:12,310 --> 07:50:13,250
You're my friends!

8655
07:50:14,650 --> 07:50:15,970
We're friends.

8656
07:50:26,720 --> 07:50:28,060
We're okay.

8657
07:50:28,880 --> 07:50:29,380
Yay!

8658
07:50:30,840 --> 07:50:32,120
We're like...

8659
07:50:32,120 --> 07:50:32,960
Top.

8660
07:50:33,920 --> 07:50:34,900
Bang, bang, bang.

8661
07:50:35,560 --> 07:50:35,880
Yeah!

8662
07:50:35,880 --> 07:50:36,020
Yeah!

8663
07:50:42,320 --> 07:50:42,880
What?

8664
07:50:47,940 --> 07:50:49,060
My door!

8665
07:50:49,920 --> 07:50:50,320
Get out!

8666
07:50:53,880 --> 07:50:55,880
Oh, that poor girl.

8667
07:50:56,180 --> 07:50:56,960
Oh, she made it.

8668
07:50:58,220 --> 07:50:59,140
I think we all made it.

8669
07:50:59,520 --> 07:51:00,420
We all made it.

8670
07:51:01,620 --> 07:51:03,620
We all made it.

8671
07:51:03,620 --> 07:51:04,180
Alright.

8672
07:51:04,780 --> 07:51:06,020
Did we all make it?

8673
07:51:06,200 --> 07:51:07,380
We did it, everybody!

8674
07:51:08,600 --> 07:51:10,020
We did it!

8675
07:51:10,620 --> 07:51:11,060
Yay!

8676
07:51:14,420 --> 07:51:16,460
Bang, bang, bang.

8677
07:51:16,720 --> 07:51:17,460
I'm Lily Thanos.

8678
07:51:18,800 --> 07:51:23,540
That guy looked like he had... I haven't watched Squid Game Season 2 yet, but he looked like he had so much fun.

8679
07:51:33,800 --> 07:51:36,220
Friend, friend, friend, friend.

8680
07:51:36,340 --> 07:51:38,400
I'm gonna get there first!

8681
07:51:47,880 --> 07:51:48,640
Nice.

8682
07:51:49,220 --> 07:51:50,420
Oh, look.

8683
07:51:50,520 --> 07:51:51,420
Shelly died.

8684
07:51:51,580 --> 07:51:52,840
I got there first.

8685
07:51:53,420 --> 07:51:55,220
But I got betrayed.

8686
07:51:56,600 --> 07:51:58,640
Nothing personal, kid.

8687
07:51:59,340 --> 07:52:00,720
Nothing personal.

8688
07:52:01,680 --> 07:52:03,240
I got there first.

8689
07:52:03,360 --> 07:52:05,040
I got the ping on my side.

8690
07:52:07,900 --> 07:52:08,780
Let's go.

8691
07:52:08,940 --> 07:52:10,120
We did it!

8692
07:52:10,240 --> 07:52:10,560
Yeah!

8693
07:52:13,300 --> 07:52:14,220
Oh my god, wait.

8694
07:52:14,500 --> 07:52:15,420
Can I buy it now?

8695
07:52:16,420 --> 07:52:16,900
Push.

8696
07:52:17,420 --> 07:52:18,000
I can buy.

8697
07:52:18,040 --> 07:52:19,240
How do I use it, though?

8698
07:52:19,940 --> 07:52:20,980
I spent my money.

8699
07:52:21,920 --> 07:52:22,960
How do I use this?

8700
07:52:24,140 --> 07:52:27,820
He's not the kid the orphan is.

8701
07:52:27,820 --> 07:52:29,800
How do I spend my... How do I use it?

8702
07:52:30,480 --> 07:52:33,340
We have one, so we can't use it on these games.

8703
07:52:35,820 --> 07:52:36,880
Alright, what's this?

8704
07:52:37,180 --> 07:52:38,260
Oh, is this a glass game?

8705
07:52:39,400 --> 07:52:40,060
Oh, shit.

8706
07:52:40,900 --> 07:52:41,540
Oh, shit.

8707
07:52:41,620 --> 07:52:42,980
What if I just push him off?

8708
07:52:44,000 --> 07:52:44,780
Oh, no.

8709
07:52:49,530 --> 07:52:50,750
Guys, I don't know.

8710
07:52:50,810 --> 07:52:52,770
I feel like...

8711
07:52:52,770 --> 07:52:54,350
Can I push them off?

8712
07:52:55,610 --> 07:52:56,050
Yes.

8713
07:52:58,790 --> 07:52:59,950
How do I push them?

8714
07:53:00,730 --> 07:53:01,730
Guys, how do you push?

8715
07:53:04,590 --> 07:53:05,830
How do you do it?

8716
07:53:06,710 --> 07:53:07,730
How do you push?

8717
07:53:07,850 --> 07:53:09,010
It's not P, I tried.

8718
07:53:09,150 --> 07:53:10,330
I'm pushing them.

8719
07:53:11,050 --> 07:53:12,630
I'm literally trying to push them.

8720
07:53:15,630 --> 07:53:16,790
Um, I'm trying.

8721
07:53:17,870 --> 07:53:18,290
F?

8722
07:53:18,630 --> 07:53:19,810
No, it's not F.

8723
07:53:20,070 --> 07:53:20,310
T?

8724
07:53:20,910 --> 07:53:21,390
No.

8725
07:53:24,530 --> 07:53:26,730
Oh my god, it's so scary, because we're all bunched up.

8726
07:53:26,730 --> 07:53:27,790
Right click?

8727
07:53:31,110 --> 07:53:32,450
Don't be a hero.

8728
07:53:33,690 --> 07:53:35,110
Don't be a hero.

8729
07:53:35,770 --> 07:53:37,150
Never be a hero.

8730
07:53:38,170 --> 07:53:38,890
Come on, children.

8731
07:53:39,050 --> 07:53:39,510
Do it.

8732
07:53:41,190 --> 07:53:42,130
Come on, children.

8733
07:53:42,310 --> 07:53:42,650
Nice.

8734
07:53:43,750 --> 07:53:44,610
Bye, children.

8735
07:53:46,930 --> 07:53:47,470
Come on.

8736
07:53:47,690 --> 07:53:49,090
We know you guys want to.

8737
07:53:51,170 --> 07:53:51,970
One of us.

8738
07:53:52,010 --> 07:53:52,830
I'll keep waiting.

8739
07:53:53,730 --> 07:53:54,810
I'll keep waiting.

8740
07:53:56,730 --> 07:53:57,910
I'll keep waiting.

8741
07:53:58,130 --> 07:53:59,230
I'm fine with waiting.

8742
07:53:59,510 --> 07:54:01,930
If we all die, we all die together, kids.

8743
07:54:02,530 --> 07:54:03,610
Isn't that great?

8744
07:54:06,050 --> 07:54:09,190
If we all die, we all die together.

8745
07:54:10,330 --> 07:54:11,670
Come on, children.

8746
07:54:14,450 --> 07:54:15,310
That's good.

8747
07:54:15,430 --> 07:54:16,430
Good job, kids.

8748
07:54:18,310 --> 07:54:20,690
Come on, we have two more minutes left.

8749
07:54:23,150 --> 07:54:25,010
Worst prisoner dilemma.

8750
07:54:28,330 --> 07:54:31,350
Oh my god, he couldn't even make the jump.

8751
07:54:32,370 --> 07:54:34,170
How long is this bridge?

8752
07:54:34,630 --> 07:54:37,650
There's like six, seven more.

8753
07:54:39,270 --> 07:54:40,270
Come on, Sammy.

8754
07:54:40,470 --> 07:54:41,370
Get over here.

8755
07:54:42,310 --> 07:54:42,910
Come on.

8756
07:54:43,610 --> 07:54:45,130
We can all wait here.

8757
07:54:46,470 --> 07:54:47,150
Come on.

8758
07:54:47,270 --> 07:54:48,710
I know you all want to wait.

8759
07:54:49,210 --> 07:54:51,830
If I could, I would push all of you guys if I could.

8760
07:54:51,830 --> 07:54:53,910
I really wish I could.

8761
07:54:54,170 --> 07:54:59,490
I literally spent my money on a push and I can't even push you guys.

8762
07:55:00,070 --> 07:55:01,430
Shit, I got a game.

8763
07:55:02,630 --> 07:55:02,970
Okay.

8764
07:55:03,730 --> 07:55:05,390
I can still wait, guys.

8765
07:55:06,490 --> 07:55:07,310
Come on, kids.

8766
07:55:07,630 --> 07:55:08,750
You know you want to.

8767
07:55:10,710 --> 07:55:12,370
I'm not gonna take the jump yet.

8768
07:55:12,410 --> 07:55:13,590
I still have time.

8769
07:55:14,390 --> 07:55:15,430
I still have time.

8770
07:55:15,550 --> 07:55:19,830
The moment I don't have time, I'll play.

8771
07:55:21,830 --> 07:55:22,690
There's no way.

8772
07:55:23,910 --> 07:55:25,810
Who told me to jump left?

8773
07:55:26,050 --> 07:55:27,610
Who told me to jump left?

8774
07:55:27,830 --> 07:55:29,030
Who was it?

8775
07:55:31,850 --> 07:55:33,490
Someone said left.

8776
07:55:37,270 --> 07:55:38,770
Don't worry, we still have time.

8777
07:55:40,010 --> 07:55:40,810
Come on, kids.

8778
07:55:41,070 --> 07:55:42,030
You know you want to.

8779
07:55:42,110 --> 07:55:44,530
We can wait here all day.

8780
07:55:45,250 --> 07:55:47,830
Children, we can keep waiting.

8781
07:55:48,310 --> 07:55:48,970
Come on.

8782
07:55:49,690 --> 07:55:51,690
Come on, we can keep waiting.

8783
07:55:53,370 --> 07:55:54,330
Stupid ass.

8784
07:55:54,750 --> 07:55:55,610
Alright, kids.

8785
07:55:58,430 --> 07:55:59,190
You think I care?

8786
07:55:59,430 --> 07:56:00,790
I hope the glass breaks.

8787
07:56:00,950 --> 07:56:01,610
You think I care?

8788
07:56:01,650 --> 07:56:02,750
I have nothing to lose.

8789
07:56:03,210 --> 07:56:04,690
This is my secondary game.

8790
07:56:05,330 --> 07:56:06,710
I'm here to play Marvel Rivals.

8791
07:56:07,430 --> 07:56:09,210
This is my second game here.

8792
07:56:11,630 --> 07:56:12,850
We're not gonna make it.

8793
07:56:12,850 --> 07:56:15,190
You know we're not gonna make it too.

8794
07:56:15,450 --> 07:56:18,550
You fucking know we're not gonna make it if you don't make that jump.

8795
07:56:19,050 --> 07:56:19,710
That's fucking right.

8796
07:56:20,130 --> 07:56:20,770
You know it.

8797
07:56:20,950 --> 07:56:22,330
We have 18 seconds left.

8798
07:56:22,770 --> 07:56:23,550
That's right.

8799
07:56:23,930 --> 07:56:24,630
We have 15.

8800
07:56:24,710 --> 07:56:26,310
You gotta make that jump, Smokemaster.

8801
07:56:26,650 --> 07:56:28,070
You gotta make that jump.

8802
07:56:28,190 --> 07:56:29,010
That's fucking right.

8803
07:56:29,310 --> 07:56:30,310
Now I'm gonna die.

8804
07:56:34,950 --> 07:56:36,670
We all die.

8805
07:56:37,630 --> 07:56:38,250
It's fine.

8806
07:56:38,370 --> 07:56:39,030
We all die.

8807
07:56:39,150 --> 07:56:41,090
And I gotta pick my...

8808
07:56:41,090 --> 07:56:42,430
I got an attacker defense.

8809
07:56:45,390 --> 07:56:47,090
And then now I get to...

8810
07:56:48,430 --> 07:56:48,970
It's fine.

8811
07:56:49,010 --> 07:56:49,970
We all die to anyone.

8812
07:56:54,270 --> 07:56:55,330
Alright, close game.

8813
07:56:56,450 --> 07:56:57,930
I don't know if he wants to play.

8814
07:56:58,210 --> 07:56:59,310
If he wants to play...

8815
07:56:59,310 --> 07:56:59,810
Don't talk to me.

8816
07:56:59,950 --> 07:57:00,790
Don't talk to me.

8817
07:57:00,890 --> 07:57:01,330
Don't talk to me.

8818
07:57:01,610 --> 07:57:02,410
Don't talk to me.

8819
07:57:02,490 --> 07:57:03,290
I'm very tired.

8820
07:57:04,850 --> 07:57:05,710
Don't talk to me.

8821
07:57:05,970 --> 07:57:07,650
Now we're back to the main game.

8822
07:57:07,650 --> 07:57:08,570
We killed another man.

8823
07:57:13,280 --> 07:57:14,120
We're back.

8824
07:57:14,300 --> 07:57:15,700
I don't know if this comp's gonna work.

8825
07:57:15,740 --> 07:57:17,260
Wait, it's that Korean guy!

8826
07:57:17,760 --> 07:57:18,500
It's him!

8827
07:57:19,640 --> 07:57:20,840
I hope he's okay.

8828
07:57:25,140 --> 07:57:25,620
Yay!

8829
07:57:26,660 --> 07:57:27,540
We're back.

8830
07:57:27,960 --> 07:57:28,360
Yo, Thor.

8831
07:57:30,040 --> 07:57:32,340
If Thor doesn't work, are you strange?

8832
07:57:32,780 --> 07:57:33,160
Yeah, no.

8833
07:57:33,360 --> 07:57:34,480
I'm gonna go back if it doesn't work.

8834
07:57:35,640 --> 07:57:36,120
Alright.

8835
07:57:36,700 --> 07:57:37,420
Here we go.

8836
07:57:37,420 --> 07:57:39,220
I have a goal.

8837
07:57:39,340 --> 07:57:40,540
I have a goal to do today.

8838
07:57:40,540 --> 07:57:41,800
And maybe tomorrow.

8839
07:57:45,620 --> 07:57:47,540
It may be tomorrow.

8840
07:57:53,100 --> 07:57:57,020
No, he doesn't believe it.

8841
07:57:59,240 --> 07:58:02,120
What do you mean it may be tomorrow?

8842
07:58:04,600 --> 07:58:07,680
What do you mean it may be tomorrow?

8843
07:58:07,700 --> 07:58:09,000
I don't like that.

8844
07:58:09,320 --> 07:58:12,180
I don't like that he said it may be tomorrow.

8845
07:58:16,440 --> 07:58:18,080
There's a Widow top right side.

8846
07:58:20,820 --> 07:58:21,480
Oh my god.

8847
07:58:24,380 --> 07:58:26,420
He doesn't believe that.

8848
07:58:27,260 --> 07:58:29,560
I think he stopped believing.

8849
07:58:32,800 --> 07:58:35,800
The fact that he's like, it may be tomorrow.

8850
07:58:41,580 --> 07:58:42,620
Wolverine's coming over.

8851
07:58:43,440 --> 07:58:43,820
No!

8852
07:58:50,460 --> 07:58:52,220
What the fuck?

8853
07:58:52,520 --> 07:58:53,600
I don't see you guys.

8854
07:58:56,040 --> 07:58:56,680
Guys?

8855
07:59:02,120 --> 07:59:05,720
What happened?

8856
07:59:06,580 --> 07:59:08,800
What happened?

8857
07:59:09,360 --> 07:59:15,140
What the fuck happened?

8858
07:59:15,700 --> 07:59:19,040
I got so confused.

8859
07:59:20,040 --> 07:59:24,000
Oh my

8860
07:59:27,190 --> 07:59:27,550
god.

8861
07:59:27,550 --> 07:59:28,370
He's going in.

8862
07:59:33,890 --> 07:59:36,510
Oh my god, I'm just scared.

8863
07:59:49,550 --> 07:59:51,950
Alright, I'm a little scared.

8864
07:59:52,410 --> 07:59:53,170
Not gonna lie.

8865
08:00:01,240 --> 08:00:02,700
Alright, let's go!

8866
08:00:05,040 --> 08:00:06,140
Let's do this!

8867
08:00:07,340 --> 08:00:08,640
Let's not do this.

8868
08:00:09,660 --> 08:00:11,740
Let's not do this, I guess.

8869
08:00:13,460 --> 08:00:14,140
Goodbye.

8870
08:00:24,840 --> 08:00:29,320
You know, it was very scary when like, you know.

8871
08:00:32,120 --> 08:00:33,480
What happened?

8872
08:00:35,020 --> 08:00:36,280
That was very scary.

8873
08:00:36,600 --> 08:00:37,500
Not gonna lie.

8874
08:00:40,800 --> 08:00:41,660
Oh my god.

8875
08:00:41,780 --> 08:00:42,020
Oh my god, I can't.

8876
08:00:42,380 --> 08:00:43,760
I can't keep killing you.

8877
08:00:44,820 --> 08:00:46,180
Oh my god.

8878
08:00:46,360 --> 08:00:47,400
It's so scary.

8879
08:00:48,920 --> 08:00:49,820
Wolverine behind!

8880
08:00:51,080 --> 08:00:52,300
I slept him, I slept him.

8881
08:00:58,200 --> 08:00:59,780
I'm a little scared, guys.

8882
08:01:01,620 --> 08:01:03,260
Oh my god, I'm a little scared.

8883
08:01:06,460 --> 08:01:07,860
Oh my god.

8884
08:01:09,540 --> 08:01:10,620
Oh my god.

8885
08:01:13,700 --> 08:01:15,520
This is a little...

8886
08:01:15,520 --> 08:01:17,460
Oh shit, no, fuck that one guy though.

8887
08:01:17,520 --> 08:01:18,640
No, you're right, no, fuck him.

8888
08:01:19,560 --> 08:01:21,260
Yeah, you're right, he deserved that.

8889
08:01:21,400 --> 08:01:22,560
He fucking deserved that.

8890
08:01:29,820 --> 08:01:30,860
Wolverine won, Wolverine won.

8891
08:01:35,110 --> 08:01:35,910
Jesus Christ.

8892
08:01:38,550 --> 08:01:39,150
I got both.

8893
08:01:42,610 --> 08:01:43,250
Lift!

8894
08:01:50,060 --> 08:01:51,600
We're all so slow.

8895
08:01:52,220 --> 08:01:53,440
We're all so slow.

8896
08:01:59,310 --> 08:02:00,930
Oh, he's... yeah.

8897
08:02:06,270 --> 08:02:07,870
Oh my god.

8898
08:02:08,570 --> 08:02:10,610
Oh my god, what the fuck?

8899
08:02:10,670 --> 08:02:11,730
It's so fucked up.

8900
08:02:12,170 --> 08:02:14,170
Where am I?

8901
08:02:14,290 --> 08:02:15,050
Okay, I'm here.

8902
08:02:17,730 --> 08:02:19,410
We're like animals.

8903
08:02:19,750 --> 08:02:20,230
Animals.

8904
08:02:27,210 --> 08:02:27,690
Magic?

8905
08:02:31,030 --> 08:02:31,890
No, mag, mag.

8906
08:02:32,770 --> 08:02:33,530
Oh yeah, yeah.

8907
08:02:33,970 --> 08:02:36,690
I can solo on cap if you want a moon knight.

8908
08:02:36,870 --> 08:02:37,250
Big.

8909
08:02:38,550 --> 08:02:39,850
I don't think we...

8910
08:02:39,850 --> 08:02:43,370
Just cause the Loki clones, they'll either swap or you can't kill him.

8911
08:02:44,170 --> 08:02:45,930
You're fine, you're so healthy.

8912
08:02:47,370 --> 08:02:49,410
Who wants a piece of me now?

8913
08:02:50,070 --> 08:02:51,750
Badum, badum, badadum.

8914
08:02:51,870 --> 08:02:53,460
Badum, badum, badadum.

8915
08:02:54,350 --> 08:02:56,650
Badum, badum, badadum.

8916
08:02:56,830 --> 08:02:57,810
Badum, badum, badadum.

8917
08:02:58,210 --> 08:03:01,510
Badum, badum, badadum.

8918
08:03:01,810 --> 08:03:03,270
Badum, badum, badadum.

8919
08:03:03,270 --> 08:03:03,890
Badum, badum, badadum.

8920
08:03:08,250 --> 08:03:13,110
Did you guys like how I like just stopped talking?

8921
08:03:15,250 --> 08:03:17,170
Oh my god, please, no!

8922
08:03:18,410 --> 08:03:21,330
I literally was like...

8923
08:03:21,330 --> 08:03:22,810
I just ran away.

8924
08:03:23,010 --> 08:03:24,430
I had PTSD.

8925
08:03:27,450 --> 08:03:29,510
I literally had PTSD.

8926
08:03:30,590 --> 08:03:32,090
And just fucking ran.

8927
08:03:39,650 --> 08:03:40,770
Peace out.

8928
08:03:41,490 --> 08:03:43,150
I was having a fun...

8929
08:03:43,150 --> 08:03:44,490
Some fun music time.

8930
08:03:47,590 --> 08:03:48,390
Alright.

8931
08:03:49,150 --> 08:03:49,810
Did we leave them?

8932
08:03:50,550 --> 08:03:51,290
Did we do it?

8933
08:03:57,430 --> 08:03:58,350
Did we do it?

8934
08:03:58,870 --> 08:04:00,350
Did we leave them?

8935
08:04:03,770 --> 08:04:05,070
Oh my god.

8936
08:04:11,470 --> 08:04:12,990
No, no!

8937
08:04:13,830 --> 08:04:14,230
No!

8938
08:04:16,630 --> 08:04:18,150
Oh my god!

8939
08:04:18,550 --> 08:04:19,250
No!

8940
08:04:20,730 --> 08:04:23,130
Oh my god, what do we do?

8941
08:04:27,630 --> 08:04:28,250
Their...

8942
08:04:28,250 --> 08:04:30,530
Their team is a lot better.

8943
08:04:31,030 --> 08:04:33,570
Their team is a lot better.

8944
08:04:39,050 --> 08:04:43,650
Bro, that Widow's fucking crazy.

8945
08:04:44,750 --> 08:04:45,410
Was it Wakanda?

8946
08:04:45,830 --> 08:04:47,170
The Wakanda dip, bro.

8947
08:04:47,650 --> 08:04:48,730
That Wakanda...

8948
08:04:48,730 --> 08:04:50,350
The Wakanda dip is crazy.

8949
08:04:50,790 --> 08:04:53,790
The Wakanda dip is crazy.

8950
08:04:53,790 --> 08:04:55,430
Heal us.

8951
08:04:56,030 --> 08:04:57,430
Oh my god.

8952
08:04:57,990 --> 08:05:00,030
Bro, fucking...

8953
08:05:00,030 --> 08:05:01,330
Wakanda, man.

8954
08:05:02,330 --> 08:05:04,090
What do we do about Wakanda?

8955
08:05:04,850 --> 08:05:06,250
This is why Wakanda no more.

8956
08:05:06,490 --> 08:05:09,730
This is exactly why we...

8957
08:05:11,270 --> 08:05:12,630
Wakanda no more.

8958
08:05:18,010 --> 08:05:19,870
No, no, no, Wakanda, maybe.

8959
08:05:19,990 --> 08:05:21,710
Wakanda's stealing my rank points.

8960
08:05:23,790 --> 08:05:26,410
Get them out of my fucking game.

8961
08:05:29,530 --> 08:05:32,930
We had a better chance at the last bridge.

8962
08:05:35,870 --> 08:05:37,210
Wakanda no more.

8963
08:05:38,690 --> 08:05:40,950
I'm gonna expose Wakanda to the world.

8964
08:05:41,610 --> 08:05:42,470
This is why...

8965
08:05:42,470 --> 08:05:47,290
This is why Wakanda shifts would've wanted to stay isolated.

8966
08:05:49,710 --> 08:05:50,970
Wakanda forever.

8967
08:05:53,790 --> 08:05:55,970
3, 2, 1.

8968
08:05:58,690 --> 08:06:00,270
My rank ruins.

8969
08:06:01,270 --> 08:06:02,530
That's not what I wanted.

8970
08:06:03,350 --> 08:06:05,710
Sometimes the sensitivity for this is fucking crazy.

8971
08:06:08,990 --> 08:06:10,250
Oh my god.

8972
08:06:10,850 --> 08:06:12,830
I like how they're like, you know what?

8973
08:06:13,050 --> 08:06:14,930
I'm gonna try Widow.

8974
08:06:15,570 --> 08:06:18,310
Surely, like, it'll be fine, right?

8975
08:06:21,350 --> 08:06:23,930
Oh my god, Wakanda, let's go!

8976
08:06:30,310 --> 08:06:31,770
How do I get out of here?

8977
08:06:32,230 --> 08:06:32,650
How do I?

8978
08:06:33,510 --> 08:06:34,230
How do I?

8979
08:06:38,590 --> 08:06:39,790
Oh shit, okay.

8980
08:06:41,530 --> 08:06:42,630
Oh my god, I want to.

8981
08:06:45,330 --> 08:06:48,690
Oh my god, I'm so fucking... where do I look at?

8982
08:06:50,570 --> 08:06:51,490
Oh wait.

8983
08:06:55,870 --> 08:06:58,130
Oh my god, I didn't know where to look at.

8984
08:06:58,610 --> 08:07:00,370
Everybody was like, everywhere.

8985
08:07:00,570 --> 08:07:03,550
I was like, where do I... where do I position?

8986
08:07:05,690 --> 08:07:09,110
Guys, I didn't realize...

8987
08:07:12,950 --> 08:07:13,570
Oh.

8988
08:07:14,370 --> 08:07:15,010
Oh.

8989
08:07:25,390 --> 08:07:26,850
Wakanda is so good.

8990
08:07:27,510 --> 08:07:29,570
Not like, actual Wakanda, but like...

8991
08:07:31,850 --> 08:07:33,870
Give you the damage boost.

8992
08:07:34,310 --> 08:07:35,410
Oh my god.

8993
08:07:36,250 --> 08:07:37,230
What the fuck?

8994
08:07:37,290 --> 08:07:38,230
Oh my god.

8995
08:07:38,530 --> 08:07:39,630
Like, I don't even...

8996
08:07:40,650 --> 08:07:41,290
Please.

8997
08:07:41,850 --> 08:07:43,830
Like, where do I go?

8998
08:07:49,430 --> 08:07:51,770
Where the fuck is the turret?

8999
08:08:00,800 --> 08:08:01,260
Oh no.

9000
08:08:02,860 --> 08:08:03,400
Oh no.

9001
08:08:04,480 --> 08:08:05,460
It's so low.

9002
08:08:08,260 --> 08:08:09,000
Oh, fuck it.

9003
08:08:09,100 --> 08:08:09,560
Let's go.

9004
08:08:10,180 --> 08:08:10,880
Let's go.

9005
08:08:10,920 --> 08:08:11,540
Let's go in.

9006
08:08:11,620 --> 08:08:11,960
Let's go.

9007
08:08:11,980 --> 08:08:12,940
We're so undefeatable.

9008
08:08:12,940 --> 08:08:14,020
Let's fucking go.

9009
08:08:14,480 --> 08:08:15,340
Let's go.

9010
08:08:17,080 --> 08:08:18,560
We're so undefeatable.

9011
08:08:18,800 --> 08:08:19,720
Let's fucking go.

9012
08:08:21,800 --> 08:08:21,920
Oh.

9013
08:08:22,500 --> 08:08:23,780
That was my bad.

9014
08:08:24,080 --> 08:08:25,880
I hope he doesn't know that I did that.

9015
08:08:26,000 --> 08:08:27,460
Oh my god.

9016
08:08:27,520 --> 08:08:27,820
Okay.

9017
08:08:29,780 --> 08:08:30,520
Don't worry.

9018
08:08:30,580 --> 08:08:31,440
He doesn't know.

9019
08:08:32,360 --> 08:08:33,360
Cause how would he know?

9020
08:08:33,820 --> 08:08:35,540
How would he know it was me all along?

9021
08:08:35,680 --> 08:08:36,440
How would he...

9022
08:08:41,270 --> 08:08:42,750
How would he know?

9023
08:08:43,370 --> 08:08:44,410
How would he know?

9024
08:08:45,970 --> 08:08:47,850
He doesn't know I woke him up, guys.

9025
08:08:47,910 --> 08:08:48,690
He doesn't know.

9026
08:08:49,330 --> 08:08:50,770
He doesn't.

9027
08:08:53,390 --> 08:08:54,950
There's no way he knows.

9028
08:08:55,330 --> 08:08:56,590
Guys, there's no way.

9029
08:08:56,910 --> 08:09:00,250
There's no fucking way he knows it was me that woke him up.

9030
08:09:00,690 --> 08:09:04,970
He did the fucking sickest sleep of his life and then I fucking woke him up for that.

9031
08:09:05,150 --> 08:09:05,470
For it.

9032
08:09:06,390 --> 08:09:08,110
There's no way he knows it was me, though.

9033
08:09:11,070 --> 08:09:11,790
No.

9034
08:09:11,790 --> 08:09:12,770
There's no way.

9035
08:09:14,690 --> 08:09:15,390
Alright.

9036
08:09:15,830 --> 08:09:16,930
I'll push the cart.

9037
08:09:18,630 --> 08:09:20,130
No, no, no.

9038
08:09:20,290 --> 08:09:21,510
No, you wouldn't.

9039
08:09:21,990 --> 08:09:23,430
You wouldn't, no.

9040
08:09:23,770 --> 08:09:25,210
Oh my god.

9041
08:09:26,730 --> 08:09:27,030
Oh.

9042
08:09:28,950 --> 08:09:29,670
Oh.

9043
08:09:29,950 --> 08:09:30,950
Oh my god.

9044
08:09:31,110 --> 08:09:33,130
They all just got deleted.

9045
08:09:34,690 --> 08:09:36,670
Oh my god.

9046
08:09:37,810 --> 08:09:39,910
Oh my god.

9047
08:09:41,170 --> 08:09:47,990
I literally looked away for one second and then everyone was 100 to 0.

9048
08:09:48,590 --> 08:09:49,410
That's crazy.

9049
08:09:50,650 --> 08:09:52,390
Dude, no, their Widow is fucking insane.

9050
08:09:56,000 --> 08:09:57,500
Someone check his PCs.

9051
08:09:57,780 --> 08:09:58,500
Not gonna lie.

9052
08:09:59,400 --> 08:10:00,700
Someone check his fucking PCs.

9053
08:10:01,820 --> 08:10:02,560
I'm scared.

9054
08:10:02,560 --> 08:10:03,400
I'm scared.

9055
08:10:07,940 --> 08:10:08,980
I wanna get that turret.

9056
08:10:10,080 --> 08:10:10,360
Alright.

9057
08:10:19,400 --> 08:10:20,420
It's alright.

9058
08:10:21,900 --> 08:10:24,920
There's a strange above us.

9059
08:10:28,940 --> 08:10:30,780
Don't worry.

9060
08:10:30,980 --> 08:10:33,400
I came back for all of you.

9061
08:10:33,920 --> 08:10:34,940
I'm sorry.

9062
08:10:36,640 --> 08:10:37,900
I'm so sorry.

9063
08:10:37,900 --> 08:10:37,960
I'm sorry.

9064
08:10:39,960 --> 08:10:41,060
Strange is half.

9065
08:10:47,430 --> 08:10:48,210
Strange is low.

9066
08:10:48,270 --> 08:10:48,710
Strange is low.

9067
08:10:51,310 --> 08:10:51,850
Oh.

9068
08:10:55,170 --> 08:10:56,410
We're so healthy.

9069
08:10:59,970 --> 08:11:01,370
I think he has...

9070
08:11:01,370 --> 08:11:02,590
I think he has ult.

9071
08:11:02,670 --> 08:11:03,930
I think the Wolverine has ult.

9072
08:11:03,990 --> 08:11:04,790
I'm a little afraid.

9073
08:11:05,370 --> 08:11:06,810
I'm a...

9074
08:11:07,370 --> 08:11:08,590
I got you.

9075
08:11:08,590 --> 08:11:09,850
I got you.

9076
08:11:11,010 --> 08:11:12,270
Oh, that's worse.

9077
08:11:17,700 --> 08:11:18,260
There we go.

9078
08:11:20,800 --> 08:11:21,260
Okay.

9079
08:11:21,460 --> 08:11:21,780
That's fine.

9080
08:11:21,860 --> 08:11:22,220
Got it.

9081
08:11:23,640 --> 08:11:24,340
He got it.

9082
08:11:25,320 --> 08:11:25,600
Oh.

9083
08:11:28,960 --> 08:11:29,820
It's fine.

9084
08:11:29,900 --> 08:11:30,420
He got it.

9085
08:11:30,680 --> 08:11:31,700
It's not fine.

9086
08:11:31,780 --> 08:11:32,900
I don't feel fine anymore.

9087
08:11:33,760 --> 08:11:35,480
Oh my god.

9088
08:11:37,740 --> 08:11:39,240
Oh my god.

9089
08:11:39,240 --> 08:11:39,560
Oh my god.

9090
08:11:39,560 --> 08:11:39,560
Okay.

9091
08:11:39,740 --> 08:11:40,060
You're right.

9092
08:11:40,260 --> 08:11:41,120
You're so right.

9093
08:11:42,620 --> 08:11:43,680
You're so right.

9094
08:11:45,120 --> 08:11:46,460
You're so fucking right.

9095
08:11:48,380 --> 08:11:49,380
What the fuck?

9096
08:11:50,300 --> 08:11:51,340
What the...

9097
08:11:53,420 --> 08:11:54,380
Oh my god.

9098
08:11:54,500 --> 08:11:55,120
You're so right.

9099
08:11:59,030 --> 08:11:59,550
Wait.

9100
08:11:59,670 --> 08:12:00,090
Magniel's one.

9101
08:12:00,150 --> 08:12:00,610
Magniel's one.

9102
08:12:05,380 --> 08:12:06,420
Oh my god.

9103
08:12:06,440 --> 08:12:07,600
You're so right for that.

9104
08:12:10,280 --> 08:12:11,340
Oh my god.

9105
08:12:11,340 --> 08:12:11,340
Oh no.

9106
08:12:11,480 --> 08:12:11,740
He's...

9107
08:12:11,740 --> 08:12:12,920
It's too late.

9108
08:12:13,960 --> 08:12:14,780
It was too late.

9109
08:12:17,520 --> 08:12:18,880
Oh my god.

9110
08:12:19,020 --> 08:12:19,680
Okay.

9111
08:12:25,200 --> 08:12:26,320
It's okay.

9112
08:12:28,180 --> 08:12:30,940
This is a wild game.

9113
08:12:39,700 --> 08:12:42,600
Ba-dum-ba-dum-ba-da-dum.

9114
08:12:42,760 --> 08:12:43,660
Ba-dum-ba.

9115
08:12:44,040 --> 08:12:44,700
Like I...

9116
08:12:44,700 --> 08:12:47,640
Oh my god.

9117
08:12:48,040 --> 08:12:49,280
Oh my god.

9118
08:12:49,440 --> 08:12:50,100
Please look at me.

9119
08:12:50,760 --> 08:12:51,540
Please look at me.

9120
08:12:52,300 --> 08:12:52,920
Please.

9121
08:12:54,960 --> 08:12:56,240
Please look at me.

9122
08:13:03,040 --> 08:13:04,040
It's alright.

9123
08:13:05,600 --> 08:13:06,200
It's okay.

9124
08:13:06,520 --> 08:13:09,820
He didn't pay for this game, but that's alright.

9125
08:13:09,880 --> 08:13:10,860
I believe in him.

9126
08:13:12,880 --> 08:13:14,760
Oh my god.

9127
08:13:14,820 --> 08:13:15,180
Okay.

9128
08:13:16,820 --> 08:13:18,300
Where's the fear going for?

9129
08:13:18,700 --> 08:13:20,900
Where is he?

9130
08:13:23,360 --> 08:13:24,480
Oh my god.

9131
08:13:24,720 --> 08:13:25,600
I'm ulting this.

9132
08:13:27,180 --> 08:13:30,160
We might be slow, but...

9133
08:13:30,160 --> 08:13:30,880
It's fine.

9134
08:13:36,170 --> 08:13:37,550
Oh shit.

9135
08:13:37,690 --> 08:13:38,750
He missed.

9136
08:13:40,430 --> 08:13:42,070
What's going on?

9137
08:13:47,270 --> 08:13:48,950
What the fuck is going on?

9138
08:13:49,070 --> 08:13:50,110
What is going on?

9139
08:13:51,250 --> 08:13:52,790
What is going on?

9140
08:13:53,990 --> 08:13:54,290
No.

9141
08:13:54,990 --> 08:13:56,070
We made it.

9142
08:13:56,850 --> 08:13:58,430
What's going on?

9143
08:14:00,390 --> 08:14:04,950
My ult is still in shambles after this game.

9144
08:14:04,950 --> 08:14:06,130
I'm so sorry, Hyliss.

9145
08:14:07,750 --> 08:14:09,450
I'm so sorry.

9146
08:14:14,670 --> 08:14:15,830
It's okay, Hyliss.

9147
08:14:16,230 --> 08:14:19,130
I've also ruined other people's points too.

9148
08:14:19,230 --> 08:14:20,950
It's not just you, Hyliss.

9149
08:14:21,390 --> 08:14:22,170
I've also...

9150
08:14:22,170 --> 08:14:25,210
I've been fucking over a lot of people today.

9151
08:14:25,210 --> 08:14:26,090
LOL

9152
08:14:32,870 --> 08:14:33,870
It's alright.

9153
08:14:34,610 --> 08:14:36,590
That's the condition of playing with me.

9154
08:14:40,910 --> 08:14:41,870
It's okay.

9155
08:14:42,130 --> 08:14:43,530
It's not just you.

9156
08:14:43,750 --> 08:14:44,490
Don't worry.

9157
08:14:45,190 --> 08:14:47,090
It's not...

9158
08:14:47,090 --> 08:14:49,270
I think I love how Gomez was like...

9159
08:14:50,970 --> 08:14:52,330
I have a goal today.

9160
08:14:52,330 --> 08:14:53,970
And maybe tomorrow.

9161
08:14:53,970 --> 08:14:56,330
And he said it so dejectedly.

9162
08:14:58,990 --> 08:15:02,330
He said it so sadly.

9163
08:15:06,610 --> 08:15:08,030
I'm just like...

9164
08:15:08,030 --> 08:15:08,810
I'm sorry.

9165
08:15:09,590 --> 08:15:11,050
I'm so sorry.

9166
08:15:13,030 --> 08:15:16,190
I love the curse of Doki.

9167
08:15:16,990 --> 08:15:18,650
No, they're not giving up.

9168
08:15:18,750 --> 08:15:20,650
They're just very dejected.

9169
08:15:30,790 --> 08:15:33,750
LOL I don't fucking know, man.

9170
08:15:34,910 --> 08:15:42,330
LOL I feel so confident in my team.

9171
08:15:44,930 --> 08:15:46,770
I don't...

9172
08:15:46,770 --> 08:15:50,750
I don't fucking know, man.

9173
08:15:52,330 --> 08:15:57,630
LOL That's what I like to hear.

9174
08:15:58,370 --> 08:16:01,090
That's what I like to hear.

9175
08:16:02,810 --> 08:16:03,390
Woo!

9176
08:16:05,310 --> 08:16:06,010
Oh, wait.

9177
08:16:06,070 --> 08:16:06,270
What?

9178
08:16:07,170 --> 08:16:08,190
What the fuck?

9179
08:16:08,290 --> 08:16:09,850
I was like, what the fuck was that?

9180
08:16:14,960 --> 08:16:16,120
Wait, there's...

9181
08:16:16,120 --> 08:16:22,190
Can I get rid of this Loki clone?

9182
08:16:22,770 --> 08:16:24,230
The Loki's invisible tomorrow.

9183
08:16:27,630 --> 08:16:28,390
Nice.

9184
08:16:29,910 --> 08:16:30,670
Alright.

9185
08:16:39,590 --> 08:16:41,110
I'm scared.

9186
08:16:41,730 --> 08:16:42,810
I'm scared.

9187
08:16:43,450 --> 08:16:47,770
I slept him.

9188
08:16:54,050 --> 08:16:55,370
Oh my god.

9189
08:16:59,540 --> 08:17:01,220
Oh, I'm trying to keep you up.

9190
08:17:05,830 --> 08:17:07,050
Oh my god.

9191
08:17:07,170 --> 08:17:08,190
You go, Pomp.

9192
08:17:08,350 --> 08:17:08,850
You go.

9193
08:17:08,990 --> 08:17:09,690
Oh, shit.

9194
08:17:11,270 --> 08:17:12,410
I'm getting rid of that.

9195
08:17:18,030 --> 08:17:19,350
I'm a little scared.

9196
08:17:19,490 --> 08:17:20,290
Not gonna lie.

9197
08:17:22,530 --> 08:17:23,630
I'm gonna lie.

9198
08:17:23,710 --> 08:17:24,350
Not gonna lie.

9199
08:17:24,630 --> 08:17:24,670
Whoa.

9200
08:17:26,830 --> 08:17:30,570
I will ult first.

9201
08:17:31,650 --> 08:17:32,010
Okay.

9202
08:17:33,470 --> 08:17:33,970
LOL

9203
08:17:41,680 --> 08:17:43,040
Oh my god.

9204
08:17:43,480 --> 08:17:44,400
Fear, fear, fear, fear.

9205
08:17:44,600 --> 08:17:45,060
No!

9206
08:17:47,100 --> 08:17:48,740
I got stuck.

9207
08:17:52,960 --> 08:17:53,760
No!

9208
08:17:56,940 --> 08:17:59,080
I got stuck.

9209
08:17:59,080 --> 08:18:01,620
I got stuck on the pulse bomb.

9210
08:18:04,220 --> 08:18:04,580
LOL

9211
08:18:10,500 --> 08:18:11,500
No!

9212
08:18:12,960 --> 08:18:14,140
I got stuck!

9213
08:18:18,220 --> 08:18:19,620
I'm so sad.

9214
08:18:20,700 --> 08:18:22,700
That hide behind the street.

9215
08:18:22,820 --> 08:18:24,020
I got stuck!

9216
08:18:24,640 --> 08:18:25,760
I couldn't move!

9217
08:18:26,080 --> 08:18:27,000
I was...

9218
08:18:27,000 --> 08:18:29,140
I couldn't move!

9219
08:18:29,140 --> 08:18:31,700
All you have to do is sit there and don't let them walk on our supports.

9220
08:18:32,160 --> 08:18:33,180
I'll kill their widow.

9221
08:18:33,440 --> 08:18:34,620
I hate this.

9222
08:18:34,720 --> 08:18:35,960
I hate this.

9223
08:18:36,900 --> 08:18:42,320
I literally was trying to move behind, but like the pulse bomb slowed me down.

9224
08:18:43,040 --> 08:18:46,080
The pulse bomb slowed me down.

9225
08:18:47,040 --> 08:18:48,140
I'm so sad.

9226
08:18:52,500 --> 08:18:55,060
I literally couldn't move anywhere.

9227
08:18:55,380 --> 08:18:56,860
I was stuck in the sticky.

9228
08:18:57,800 --> 08:19:03,800
I was not positioned in a way for the perfect widow to shield me.

9229
08:19:09,660 --> 08:19:10,920
Okay, I'll lock in.

9230
08:19:11,760 --> 08:19:12,920
I'll lock in.

9231
08:19:13,680 --> 08:19:14,000
Oh,

9232
08:19:19,400 --> 08:19:20,340
I can't jump that.

9233
08:19:20,600 --> 08:19:21,380
I'm too slow.

9234
08:19:22,480 --> 08:19:23,600
I'm too slow.

9235
08:19:25,160 --> 08:19:26,460
I'm too slow.

9236
08:19:26,580 --> 08:19:27,780
I'm just a little guy.

9237
08:19:28,820 --> 08:19:31,060
I'm just a little guy.

9238
08:19:32,040 --> 08:19:34,000
Just a sad little guy.

9239
08:19:38,680 --> 08:19:40,680
They're off of Wakanda!

9240
08:19:50,980 --> 08:19:52,680
Oh my god.

9241
08:19:56,400 --> 08:19:57,620
Oh my god.

9242
08:20:02,280 --> 08:20:04,440
Oh my god, this is scary to be in.

9243
08:20:06,400 --> 08:20:08,580
I like how he's like, they're off of Wakanda.

9244
08:20:12,380 --> 08:20:13,300
Ornn's low, man.

9245
08:20:13,940 --> 08:20:14,660
Loki's up top.

9246
08:20:15,680 --> 08:20:16,500
Manta's asleep on me?

9247
08:20:17,960 --> 08:20:18,620
She's low?

9248
08:20:18,800 --> 08:20:18,920
Oh.

9249
08:20:26,730 --> 08:20:28,110
Oh my god.

9250
08:20:33,140 --> 08:20:34,500
Jesus Christ.

9251
08:20:36,800 --> 08:20:37,140
We'll bring low.

9252
08:20:37,260 --> 08:20:37,960
We'll bring no passive.

9253
08:20:41,570 --> 08:20:42,770
Oh my god.

9254
08:20:48,310 --> 08:20:50,010
Oh my god!

9255
08:20:50,210 --> 08:20:51,730
I'm so stressed out!

9256
08:20:52,170 --> 08:20:53,530
But I love Marvel Rivals.

9257
08:20:57,470 --> 08:20:58,850
I love Marvel.

9258
08:20:59,390 --> 08:20:59,790
Woah!

9259
08:21:03,820 --> 08:21:04,540
Woah!

9260
08:21:10,360 --> 08:21:11,400
I slept.

9261
08:21:20,050 --> 08:21:20,650
Please.

9262
08:21:20,970 --> 08:21:21,210
Please.

9263
08:21:21,530 --> 08:21:22,750
I have to love this.

9264
08:21:23,870 --> 08:21:24,450
Oh my god.

9265
08:21:29,230 --> 08:21:29,590
Oh, fear.

9266
08:21:29,910 --> 08:21:30,170
Fear.

9267
08:21:31,130 --> 08:21:31,570
Fear.

9268
08:21:35,810 --> 08:21:36,810
I tried.

9269
08:21:36,890 --> 08:21:37,850
I tried so hard.

9270
08:21:39,730 --> 08:21:40,950
Oh my god!

9271
08:21:40,990 --> 08:21:42,930
I tried so hard to keep him alive!

9272
08:21:45,170 --> 08:21:46,810
Probably not worth it though.

9273
08:21:50,840 --> 08:21:52,320
It was so close.

9274
08:21:52,600 --> 08:21:55,680
I literally did everything I could to keep him alive.

9275
08:21:56,860 --> 08:21:57,960
I was like, here's my leaves.

9276
08:21:58,060 --> 08:21:58,540
Take my leaves.

9277
08:21:58,620 --> 08:21:59,040
Take my leaves.

9278
08:21:59,180 --> 08:21:59,660
Take my leaves.

9279
08:22:01,340 --> 08:22:04,040
Just keep my leaves.

9280
08:22:27,020 --> 08:22:27,440
Oh my god.

9281
08:22:27,440 --> 08:22:27,540
Magnio!

9282
08:22:27,720 --> 08:22:27,880
Magnio!

9283
08:22:27,940 --> 08:22:28,940
Strange, strange, strange, magnio!

9284
08:22:30,680 --> 08:22:31,100
Magnio!

9285
08:22:31,220 --> 08:22:31,480
Magnio!

9286
08:22:31,560 --> 08:22:31,740
Mag-1!

9287
08:22:31,820 --> 08:22:32,120
Mag-1!

9288
08:22:32,280 --> 08:22:32,980
Strange, strange, strange!

9289
08:22:38,690 --> 08:22:39,110
I...

9290
08:22:43,010 --> 08:22:44,390
Oh my god.

9291
08:22:45,370 --> 08:22:47,010
Oh my god, we did it.

9292
08:22:55,740 --> 08:22:56,840
Oh my god.

9293
08:22:56,880 --> 08:22:58,120
Oh my god, I can't believe we did it.

9294
08:23:05,170 --> 08:23:07,370
We fucking... oh my god.

9295
08:23:07,710 --> 08:23:09,010
They might be... guys.

9296
08:23:09,290 --> 08:23:10,390
They could be freed any...

9297
08:23:10,390 --> 08:23:11,990
Alright, now on to the real game.

9298
08:23:12,610 --> 08:23:15,990
Thank god we won that game so I can actually play the real...

9299
08:23:18,610 --> 08:23:20,450
Guys, here's a test.

9300
08:23:20,450 --> 08:23:21,870
Will we...

9301
08:23:21,870 --> 08:23:24,590
Will we win squid game first?

9302
08:23:24,830 --> 08:23:27,250
Or... are we gonna win squid game first?

9303
08:23:27,390 --> 08:23:30,670
Or are we gonna get top 500 first?

9304
08:23:32,990 --> 08:23:33,550
Alright.

9305
08:23:34,210 --> 08:23:35,150
Let's take our bets.

9306
08:23:35,230 --> 08:23:35,850
Let's do a poll.

9307
08:23:36,030 --> 08:23:36,890
Are we... oh man.

9308
08:23:36,990 --> 08:23:39,790
I can't do another prediction because we only have one prediction.

9309
08:23:41,670 --> 08:23:43,790
Hell yeah, give up hope for 44.

9310
08:23:44,170 --> 08:23:46,850
That means die, die in Chinese.

9311
08:23:47,030 --> 08:23:47,590
Let's go.

9312
08:23:50,450 --> 08:23:50,890
Here we go.

9313
08:23:51,210 --> 08:23:53,430
Alright, let's see where we're gonna...

9314
08:23:53,430 --> 08:23:56,150
Are we gonna get squid game win?

9315
08:23:56,290 --> 08:23:58,150
Or Marvel rival wins?

9316
08:23:58,730 --> 08:23:59,890
This is the real game.

9317
08:24:00,390 --> 08:24:02,830
Now it's time for the real...

9318
08:24:02,830 --> 08:24:04,610
Real gamer hours.

9319
08:24:04,790 --> 08:24:06,070
What's the leaderboard right now?

9320
08:24:07,190 --> 08:24:08,110
It's like...

9321
08:24:08,110 --> 08:24:08,850
202.

9322
08:24:10,250 --> 08:24:12,330
Yeah, but we're trying to get the cutoff.

9323
08:24:13,470 --> 08:24:14,550
I hope like...

9324
08:24:14,550 --> 08:24:15,390
I hope...

9325
08:24:16,050 --> 08:24:17,350
What's their team name?

9326
08:24:17,350 --> 08:24:19,450
North something, right?

9327
08:24:19,630 --> 08:24:20,730
I don't remember their team name.

9328
08:24:21,270 --> 08:24:22,110
But like...

9329
08:24:22,110 --> 08:24:26,870
I hope after this session, they realize how good they have it.

9330
08:24:28,290 --> 08:24:32,450
After this session, they're like, now that we know her name, let's make sure to avoid her.

9331
08:24:37,770 --> 08:24:40,470
Let's make sure to avoid her after this.

9332
08:24:41,970 --> 08:24:43,350
In season one.

9333
08:24:47,990 --> 08:24:49,530
Alright, let's go.

9334
08:24:50,730 --> 08:24:52,830
Wait, I can push.

9335
08:24:54,390 --> 08:24:55,690
How do I push?

9336
08:24:56,250 --> 08:24:58,430
They never told me how to push.

9337
08:25:06,360 --> 08:25:07,720
I have it.

9338
08:25:07,940 --> 08:25:09,340
I have it though.

9339
08:25:10,760 --> 08:25:12,200
I don't know how to do it.

9340
08:25:18,590 --> 08:25:20,590
I wanna push one of them.

9341
08:25:22,350 --> 08:25:32,330
Po po po po po po po po po po po po po po po po po.

9342
08:25:32,490 --> 08:25:33,830
How do I skit?

9343
08:25:35,550 --> 08:25:36,370
I wanna skit.

9344
08:25:37,010 --> 08:25:37,990
Oh, there you go.

9345
08:25:39,090 --> 08:25:40,410
Alright, the real game starts.

9346
08:25:41,270 --> 08:25:43,010
They said we're gonna make it to the end.

9347
08:25:43,090 --> 08:25:44,050
I believe in us.

9348
08:25:45,050 --> 08:25:45,910
We either...

9349
08:25:45,910 --> 08:25:47,690
get to the...

9350
08:25:48,290 --> 08:25:50,630
win a squid game...

9351
08:25:50,630 --> 08:25:54,350
Or make it to top five or get to the cutoff.

9352
08:25:54,550 --> 08:25:56,850
How do I oh there it is.

9353
08:25:57,130 --> 08:25:58,470

I swear to God I'm pushing it Oh, I did?

9358
08:26:43,820 --> 08:26:45,980
When the fuck did I use it?

9359
08:26:47,020 --> 08:26:47,880
No, no, no, no.

9360
08:26:48,440 --> 08:26:49,440
No, I'm almost there.

9361
08:26:49,460 --> 08:26:50,020
I'm almost there.

9362
08:26:50,080 --> 08:26:51,300
Don't you want to push me?

9363
08:26:52,560 --> 08:26:53,800
Oh, I made it!

9364
08:26:55,980 --> 08:26:56,880
I made it.

9365
08:26:57,120 --> 08:26:58,400
When did I use it?

9366
08:27:00,540 --> 08:27:01,700
Oh, did he die?

9367
08:27:03,220 --> 08:27:04,540
Penny with the bottle?

9368
08:27:06,600 --> 08:27:07,440
There he is.

9369
08:27:07,840 --> 08:27:09,680
We're gonna push you so he can't get in.

9370
08:27:09,680 --> 08:27:11,180
We're gonna make a wall.

9371
08:27:11,180 --> 08:27:14,280
We're gonna...

9372
08:27:14,280 --> 08:27:14,640
Oh!

9373
08:27:15,060 --> 08:27:16,340
He pushed me!

9374
08:27:18,120 --> 08:27:19,980
We had a wall!

9375
08:27:21,780 --> 08:27:24,160
He actually pushed me!

9376
08:27:27,700 --> 08:27:29,920
He was like, fuck you.

9377
08:27:31,780 --> 08:27:33,880
The anti-kid's wall.

9378
08:27:34,200 --> 08:27:37,360
I can't believe he fucking pushed me.

9379
08:27:39,840 --> 08:27:41,200
He tried to get in.

9380
08:27:41,480 --> 08:27:43,280
He tried to get through the wall!

9381
08:27:44,520 --> 08:27:45,000
Freak.

9382
08:27:45,720 --> 08:27:48,220
How dare you try to get through the wall?

9383
08:27:48,860 --> 08:27:50,200
How fucking dare you?

9384
08:27:51,760 --> 08:27:54,740
He knew what you were planning on doing.

9385
08:27:57,240 --> 08:27:59,560
Look, it's all about winning.

9386
08:28:00,920 --> 08:28:01,400
Guys.

9387
08:28:02,720 --> 08:28:04,160
Also, is the game too loud?

9388
08:28:04,240 --> 08:28:05,180
I have no idea.

9389
08:28:06,200 --> 08:28:06,780
Oh, thank god.

9390
08:28:06,820 --> 08:28:07,280
Wait, no.

9391
08:28:07,340 --> 08:28:09,220
The circle is... I don't know if the circle's hard.

9392
08:28:09,860 --> 08:28:10,840
I have no idea.

9393
08:28:11,160 --> 08:28:12,840
I hope the gunshots aren't too loud.

9394
08:28:17,240 --> 08:28:18,560
Alright, I can't.

9395
08:28:18,660 --> 08:28:19,760
I have to give them my ID.

9396
08:28:19,900 --> 08:28:21,060
I have to dox myself.

9397
08:28:21,440 --> 08:28:22,300
But like...

9398
08:28:24,440 --> 08:28:26,320
But like, I said, I can't.

9399
08:28:28,060 --> 08:28:30,780
My god, this is so... Like, this is so stressful.

9400
08:28:32,100 --> 08:28:33,760
I can't do it right away.

9401
08:28:34,120 --> 08:28:35,300
I'll do it next time.

9402
08:28:35,700 --> 08:28:37,400
If we're back at it again tomorrow.

9403
08:28:37,680 --> 08:28:40,580
I also don't know how fast the ID approval thing is.

9404
08:28:40,580 --> 08:28:42,540
Oh my god, did you guys see that?

9405
08:28:42,920 --> 08:28:44,480
No one's dead yet.

9406
08:28:45,440 --> 08:28:46,120
Yay!

9407
08:28:50,890 --> 08:28:51,570
Yay!

9408
08:29:00,550 --> 08:29:06,050
Did you guys see the Fortnite with Elon Musk stream?

9409
08:29:07,270 --> 08:29:09,370
That stream was so fucking funny.

9410
08:29:09,370 --> 08:29:12,970
I think my favorite quote was like, NAME THREE WOMEN!

9411
08:29:14,910 --> 08:29:17,690
I didn't watch it, but I watched like, clips of it.

9412
08:29:17,990 --> 08:29:21,210
I love... I thought it was really funny when... What's his name?

9413
08:29:21,310 --> 08:29:21,630
Connor?

9414
08:29:22,450 --> 08:29:23,170
That's his name, right?

9415
08:29:23,250 --> 08:29:25,310
Connor was like, NAME THREE WOMEN!

9416
08:29:25,570 --> 08:29:27,650
WHY CAN'T YOU NAME THREE WOMEN?

9417
08:29:28,210 --> 08:29:30,290
And then he wouldn't name three.

9418
08:29:30,530 --> 08:29:31,690
No, he didn't!

9419
08:29:31,770 --> 08:29:33,070
He wouldn't name three!

9420
08:29:33,370 --> 08:29:35,690
No one knows... Like, people were... He's like...

9421
08:29:35,690 --> 08:29:37,590
This guy was like, I'm not Elon Musk.

9422
08:29:37,590 --> 08:29:39,970
But he sounds exactly like him.

9423
08:29:40,090 --> 08:29:43,090
I don't know, maybe it's a really good actor, but...

9424
08:29:47,530 --> 08:29:53,130
Yeah, the guy sounds like Elon Musk, but he's like, I'm not Elon Musk.

9425
08:29:53,550 --> 08:29:55,630
But he sounds exactly like him.

9426
08:29:56,370 --> 08:29:57,590
Oh, more money's being added.

9427
08:29:59,090 --> 08:30:04,950
And then, finally, after like, everybody was like, No, there's... Everybody was like, No, you're Elon Musk.

9428
08:30:04,990 --> 08:30:07,270
And then he's like, finally admitted that he really is.

9429
08:30:07,590 --> 08:30:10,610
Yeah, he finally admitted it on Twitter yesterday.

9430
08:30:12,150 --> 08:30:16,430
But I thought it was so funny that he couldn't name three women!

9431
08:30:17,010 --> 08:30:19,290
Like, any three women!

9432
08:30:22,220 --> 08:30:22,860
Just...

9433
08:30:27,910 --> 08:30:28,970
Oh, shit!

9434
08:30:30,570 --> 08:30:31,230
Wait, no!

9435
08:30:31,550 --> 08:30:32,270
No, wait!

9436
08:30:32,830 --> 08:30:33,470
Please!

9437
08:30:34,170 --> 08:30:37,610
If it's tug of war again, I can't leave the children again!

9438
08:30:39,470 --> 08:30:40,530
Oh, no!

9439
08:30:40,610 --> 08:30:41,610
It's tug of...

9440
08:30:47,180 --> 08:30:49,100
I'm sorry, children!

9441
08:30:50,200 --> 08:30:52,420
I gotta leave you again!

9442
08:30:54,700 --> 08:30:56,120
I'm sorry!

9443
08:30:56,340 --> 08:30:58,000
Am I even...

9444
08:30:58,000 --> 08:31:00,100
Am I doing anything?

9445
08:31:00,760 --> 08:31:02,760
I swear to god, I'm pressing X.

9446
08:31:02,840 --> 08:31:04,240
I swear to god.

9447
08:31:04,880 --> 08:31:06,300
I am... I...

9448
08:31:07,260 --> 08:31:08,060
I don't know.

9449
08:31:08,320 --> 08:31:09,500
I'm pushing X.

9450
08:31:09,720 --> 08:31:12,220
I'm pressing X, but my X key...

9451
08:31:12,220 --> 08:31:13,400
I am!

9452
08:31:13,600 --> 08:31:15,000
But I'm not!

9453
08:31:15,200 --> 08:31:17,320
I'm literally just standing.

9454
08:31:17,820 --> 08:31:18,480
I am!

9455
08:31:20,240 --> 08:31:22,960
I swear to god, I swear to god, I'm pressing it.

9456
08:31:23,200 --> 08:31:25,780
I swear to god, I am actually pressing it.

9457
08:31:25,800 --> 08:31:27,220
I don't know why it's not pushing.

9458
08:31:31,160 --> 08:31:32,160
Like, I...

9459
08:31:32,160 --> 08:31:32,940
Is there a delay?

9460
08:31:33,740 --> 08:31:35,740
Is there... Is there a delay?

9461
08:31:38,960 --> 08:31:41,080
Like, what do you want me to do?

9462
08:31:42,540 --> 08:31:44,780
Like, I'm pressing two things!

9463
08:31:46,450 --> 08:31:47,380
It won't let me.

9464
08:31:47,740 --> 08:31:48,980
It legitimately won't let me.

9465
08:31:49,640 --> 08:31:50,520
Did we win?

9466
08:31:51,040 --> 08:31:52,440
We did it, guys!

9467
08:31:52,720 --> 08:31:55,060
I contributed to this team!

9468
08:31:55,340 --> 08:31:55,840
No.

9469
08:31:56,500 --> 08:31:57,040
Oh, no.

9470
08:31:58,760 --> 08:32:00,280
We did it, guys!

9471
08:32:01,560 --> 08:32:02,960
I contributed!

9472
08:32:06,540 --> 08:32:08,460
We did it, kids!

9473
08:32:08,800 --> 08:32:10,920
We fucking did it!

9474
08:32:13,600 --> 08:32:15,520
I knew we could do it, children.

9475
08:32:15,940 --> 08:32:17,100
I knew it.

9476
08:32:19,880 --> 08:32:21,640
I knew we could do it.

9477
08:32:22,880 --> 08:32:24,260
Are we attack or defense?

9478
08:32:24,440 --> 08:32:26,440
If we're attack, I still have one more time to play a game.

9479
08:32:29,300 --> 08:32:30,340
Okay, we're defense.

9480
08:32:30,920 --> 08:32:31,360
Oh, no.

9481
08:32:31,420 --> 08:32:32,080
What game is it?

9482
08:32:32,100 --> 08:32:33,120
I can't...

9483
08:32:33,120 --> 08:32:33,520
Oh, no.

9484
08:32:33,580 --> 08:32:34,060
We're defense.

9485
08:32:34,460 --> 08:32:35,640
I'm skating over, guys.

9486
08:32:35,700 --> 08:32:36,320
I'm not throwing.

9487
08:32:36,400 --> 08:32:38,520
I'm literally... I'm skating over right now.

9488
08:32:38,660 --> 08:32:39,800
I'm fucking skating.

9489
08:32:39,920 --> 08:32:41,060
I'm skating so hard.

9490
08:32:42,220 --> 08:32:42,760
Wait.

9491
08:32:42,860 --> 08:32:43,220
Loading.

9492
08:32:43,940 --> 08:32:45,860
There's another intermission?

9493
08:32:48,080 --> 08:32:49,400
Are you serious?

9494
08:32:49,840 --> 08:32:50,660
Are you... Please.

9495
08:32:51,040 --> 08:32:52,380
There's... How is there another intermission?

9496
08:32:52,860 --> 08:32:53,260
Please.

9497
08:32:53,800 --> 08:32:54,740
I have 14...

9498
08:32:54,740 --> 08:32:55,620
Oh, my God.

9499
08:32:55,680 --> 08:32:56,520
Okay, I can't.

9500
08:32:56,620 --> 08:32:59,040
No, I will never know what the last game was.

9501
08:32:59,160 --> 08:33:00,220
I'll never know.

9502
08:33:00,440 --> 08:33:03,300
I'll never know what the last game was.

9503
08:33:07,680 --> 08:33:08,320
Okay.

9504
08:33:10,220 --> 08:33:10,860
Alright.

9505
08:33:16,100 --> 08:33:17,020
Oh, my God.

9506
08:33:17,160 --> 08:33:17,580
Thank you.

9507
08:33:18,660 --> 08:33:19,500
Thank you.

9508
08:33:26,710 --> 08:33:27,550
Thank you.

9509
08:33:31,780 --> 08:33:32,820
Oh, my God.

9510
08:33:33,020 --> 08:33:34,560
I... Sorry, I got locked in.

9511
08:33:34,760 --> 08:33:36,460
I hate healing Iron Man sometimes.

9512
08:33:36,840 --> 08:33:38,480
That's why I put a snowflake on him.

9513
08:33:39,700 --> 08:33:40,260
But...

9514
08:33:40,260 --> 08:33:41,960
It still sucks to heal this.

9515
08:33:42,640 --> 08:33:44,400
I fucking hate healing this.

9516
08:33:44,540 --> 08:33:45,940
I... I... I...

9517
08:33:45,940 --> 08:33:46,840
I...

9518
08:33:51,240 --> 08:33:51,800
I...

9519
08:33:54,300 --> 08:33:55,280
I froze her.

9520
08:34:00,270 --> 08:34:01,430
Oh, my God.

9521
08:34:04,630 --> 08:34:06,070
Oh, my God.

9522
08:34:06,450 --> 08:34:07,010
Stop.

9523
08:34:08,430 --> 08:34:08,850
Okay.

9524
08:34:09,070 --> 08:34:09,350
It's fine.

9525
08:34:09,430 --> 08:34:09,730
I'm okay.

9526
08:34:09,810 --> 08:34:10,370
I'm okay, guys.

9527
08:34:10,450 --> 08:34:10,790
I'm okay.

9528
08:34:11,530 --> 08:34:12,970
I am perfectly okay.

9529
08:34:13,830 --> 08:34:14,890
I'm not okay.

9530
08:34:14,970 --> 08:34:15,850
I'm not... No.

9531
08:34:16,470 --> 08:34:17,890
I'm not okay.

9532
08:34:18,610 --> 08:34:19,710
We're not in queue.

9533
08:34:23,690 --> 08:34:25,010
I'm not okay.

9534
08:34:25,190 --> 08:34:26,570
I'm not okay anymore.

9535
08:34:28,330 --> 08:34:31,090
I have never been not okay.

9536
08:34:32,950 --> 08:34:34,750
I hate... I... Oh, my God.

9537
08:34:35,510 --> 08:34:38,210
Healing Iron Man has to be like one of...

9538
08:34:38,210 --> 08:34:39,330
Oh, my God.

9539
08:34:39,850 --> 08:34:41,350
Oh, my God.

9540
08:34:41,490 --> 08:34:41,810
Walk up.

9541
08:34:41,950 --> 08:34:42,630
Walk up with this.

9542
08:34:49,690 --> 08:34:50,970
No way!

9543
08:34:51,190 --> 08:34:52,710
No fucking way!

9544
08:34:57,310 --> 08:34:58,450
Oh, my God.

9545
08:34:58,550 --> 08:34:59,830
No fucking way.

9546
08:35:01,490 --> 08:35:04,010
Let's go back to squid game.

9547
08:35:04,630 --> 08:35:05,230
Okay.

9548
08:35:05,330 --> 08:35:06,330
I need to be locked back in.

9549
08:35:06,430 --> 08:35:13,210
Every time I change from squid game to...

9550
08:35:13,210 --> 08:35:13,570
Alright.

9551
08:35:13,630 --> 08:35:14,910
I'm totally okay.

9552
08:35:21,170 --> 08:35:21,990
I froze him.

9553
08:35:28,910 --> 08:35:29,750
Oh.

9554
08:35:30,310 --> 08:35:34,150
Oh, my God.

9555
08:35:34,850 --> 08:35:36,470
Oh, my God.

9556
08:35:36,550 --> 08:35:37,050
There we go.

9557
08:35:37,930 --> 08:35:38,490
We're okay.

9558
08:35:39,590 --> 08:35:41,070
We're so healthy.

9559
08:35:42,410 --> 08:35:43,190
No.

9560
08:35:43,670 --> 08:35:43,970
No.

9561
08:35:44,350 --> 08:35:44,710
No.

9562
08:35:45,410 --> 08:35:45,810
No.

9563
08:35:45,810 --> 08:35:45,870
No.

9564
08:35:50,110 --> 08:35:51,750
Everyone's like, okay, never mind.

9565
08:35:51,790 --> 08:35:52,070
I saw the December video.

9566
08:35:52,190 --> 08:35:52,870
I thought it was funny.

9567
08:35:58,310 --> 08:35:59,850
That's so 2024.

9568
08:36:01,650 --> 08:36:02,730
My bad.

9569
08:36:09,090 --> 08:36:10,390
Oh, my God.

9570
08:36:15,310 --> 08:36:16,310
Okay.

9571
08:36:16,430 --> 08:36:21,350
I froze him.

9572
08:36:21,490 --> 08:36:21,630
I froze him.

9573
08:36:22,290 --> 08:36:22,410
Oh!

9574
08:36:28,430 --> 08:36:28,930
Okay.

9575
08:36:29,430 --> 08:36:30,210
Never mind.

9576
08:36:32,990 --> 08:36:34,470
Never mind.

9577
08:36:41,340 --> 08:36:42,620
Well, never mind.

9578
08:36:42,880 --> 08:36:43,100
Whoa.

9579
08:36:43,880 --> 08:36:44,400
Whoa.

9580
08:36:44,600 --> 08:36:44,960
Whoa.

9581
08:36:46,260 --> 08:36:47,780
There's a hawk up here.

9582
08:36:48,440 --> 08:36:49,480
What the fuck?

9583
08:36:50,300 --> 08:36:51,220
Yeah, he just emoted.

9584
08:36:51,340 --> 08:36:51,840
What the fuck?

9585
08:36:54,440 --> 08:36:55,340
Oh, fuck.

9586
08:36:56,820 --> 08:36:58,240
What the fuck?

9587
08:36:59,220 --> 08:37:00,820
What the fuck was that?

9588
08:37:05,310 --> 08:37:06,410
I hate you.

9589
08:37:06,750 --> 08:37:08,150
I mean, thank you for playing with me.

9590
08:37:11,310 --> 08:37:11,910
But...

9591
08:37:11,910 --> 08:37:13,370
You're too good at this game.

9592
08:37:19,670 --> 08:37:21,890
You think that was...

9593
08:37:21,890 --> 08:37:24,730
I have to, like, try so hard to aim.

9594
08:37:24,850 --> 08:37:26,350
Because he's trying not to die.

9595
08:37:26,570 --> 08:37:29,370
And I'm trying to make sure he gets healed.

9596
08:37:36,140 --> 08:37:38,340
But it's so hard to...

9597
08:37:38,340 --> 08:37:41,400
It's so hard to heal somebody.

9598
08:37:41,400 --> 08:37:43,480
That moves like that.

9599
08:37:43,540 --> 08:37:45,720
It's so hard.

9600
08:37:46,560 --> 08:37:50,960
Because you have to...

9601
08:37:50,960 --> 08:37:54,000
You're, like, killing their movement.

9602
08:37:54,500 --> 08:37:55,600
They're good players.

9603
08:37:55,760 --> 08:37:58,120
So their movement is so good.

9604
08:37:59,840 --> 08:38:02,320
Their movement is so good.

9605
08:38:07,540 --> 08:38:11,120
Their movement is so good.

9606
08:38:11,400 --> 08:38:11,580
Okay.

9607
08:38:12,060 --> 08:38:12,700
Play.

9608
08:38:13,060 --> 08:38:13,220
Play.

9609
08:38:18,440 --> 08:38:19,080
No.

9610
08:38:21,800 --> 08:38:22,160
No!

9611
08:38:24,640 --> 08:38:25,860
What do I do?

9612
08:38:26,260 --> 08:38:27,320
What do I do?

9613
08:38:27,560 --> 08:38:31,460
What do I...

9614
08:38:31,460 --> 08:38:34,460
What do I do?

9615
08:38:34,720 --> 08:38:36,760
What do I do?

9616
08:38:36,900 --> 08:38:40,180
Why do I keep getting solo ulted?

9617
08:38:42,640 --> 08:38:43,840
It's either...

9618
08:38:43,840 --> 08:38:47,120
It's either Magneto or Maximum Pulse.

9619
08:38:47,400 --> 08:38:48,820
Yeah, fuck you!

9620
08:38:49,000 --> 08:38:51,020
You get solo ulted too!

9621
08:38:51,840 --> 08:38:52,640
Please!

9622
08:38:53,020 --> 08:38:53,540
Please!

9623
08:38:53,720 --> 08:38:54,840
Mantis, please!

9624
08:38:56,040 --> 08:38:58,120
I just came back!

9625
08:39:03,440 --> 08:39:05,220
I'm so sad.

9626
08:39:06,260 --> 08:39:08,020
Okay, the Mantis was right there.

9627
08:39:08,220 --> 08:39:09,160
Why me?

9628
08:39:09,160 --> 08:39:11,460
Why not Mantis?

9629
08:39:14,540 --> 08:39:16,420
Why not Mantis?

9630
08:39:18,220 --> 08:39:19,300
Kill her.

9631
08:39:19,640 --> 08:39:20,760
Kill her.

9632
08:39:21,880 --> 08:39:22,580
Kill me.

9633
08:39:22,960 --> 08:39:23,420
Kill her.

9634
08:39:25,700 --> 08:39:26,440
Kill her.

9635
08:39:32,900 --> 08:39:34,680
Oh my god.

9636
08:39:35,120 --> 08:39:36,400
You didn't see that.

9637
08:39:36,660 --> 08:39:37,460
You didn't see that.

9638
08:39:42,840 --> 08:39:44,520
Kill her!

9639
08:39:45,380 --> 08:39:46,040
Luna.

9640
08:39:46,440 --> 08:39:46,540
Luna.

9641
08:39:46,760 --> 08:39:46,820
Luna.

9642
08:39:47,560 --> 08:39:48,400
Please.

9643
08:39:49,040 --> 08:39:51,380
Oh my god, you let him die!

9644
08:39:59,570 --> 08:40:04,410
I saved your life and that's how you repay me?

9645
08:40:05,190 --> 08:40:11,950
I saved your life and that's how you fucking repay me?

9646
08:40:12,690 --> 08:40:14,190
I'm so sad.

9647
08:40:15,550 --> 08:40:16,110
Please!

9648
08:40:16,410 --> 08:40:17,450
I'm just kidding.

9649
08:40:21,450 --> 08:40:23,290
Ungrateful teammates.

9650
08:40:24,530 --> 08:40:26,030
I hate this.

9651
08:40:26,130 --> 08:40:27,770
I'm just getting hard focus.

9652
08:40:29,650 --> 08:40:35,490
I just let the mods kill me and then flew away.

9653
08:40:36,890 --> 08:40:37,350
Okay.

9654
08:40:42,410 --> 08:40:42,870
Okay.

9655
08:40:43,830 --> 08:40:44,630
It's alright.

9656
08:40:46,510 --> 08:40:47,410
It's okay.

9657
08:40:49,650 --> 08:40:50,450
I'm okay.

9658
08:40:51,170 --> 08:40:52,890
I'm so fucking locked in.

9659
08:40:52,970 --> 08:40:54,210
Okay, I'm locked in for real though.

9660
08:40:55,490 --> 08:40:56,790
I'm locked in for real.

9661
08:40:58,850 --> 08:41:01,750
After what he did to me, I'm so locked in for real.

9662
08:41:07,030 --> 08:41:08,610
I swear to god, I swear!

9663
08:41:08,610 --> 08:41:08,750
Okay.

9664
08:41:16,690 --> 08:41:18,190
Okay, alright.

9665
08:41:24,610 --> 08:41:27,690
Oh my god.

9666
08:41:28,190 --> 08:41:29,530
I saw it.

9667
08:41:29,530 --> 08:41:29,690
I saw it.

9668
08:41:33,530 --> 08:41:39,650
I was so over it.

9669
08:41:40,250 --> 08:41:46,050
I did not know where he was but I knew he was close.

9670
08:42:03,970 --> 08:42:05,330
Oh no.

9671
08:42:06,110 --> 08:42:06,690
Strange half.

9672
08:42:06,690 --> 08:42:08,590
Strange low.

9673
08:42:12,200 --> 08:42:13,540
Oh

9674
08:42:18,360 --> 08:42:23,440
my god.

9675
08:42:25,380 --> 08:42:26,700
Strange low, strange left.

9676
08:42:28,640 --> 08:42:30,720
Jesus Christ.

9677
08:42:34,860 --> 08:42:35,780
No.

9678
08:42:37,040 --> 08:42:37,380
No.

9679
08:42:38,120 --> 08:42:38,920
Oh

9680
08:42:42,310 --> 08:42:43,550
my god.

9681
08:42:45,370 --> 08:42:47,690
I had to look up.

9682
08:42:47,690 --> 08:42:50,190
I had to look up and be like...

9683
08:42:54,310 --> 08:42:55,630
Oh my god.

9684
08:42:55,630 --> 08:42:58,300
I had to look up.

9685
08:43:00,910 --> 08:43:01,930
I fucking...

9686
08:43:01,930 --> 08:43:03,110
Oh my god.

9687
08:43:03,530 --> 08:43:06,130
This is actual... Oh my god.

9688
08:43:06,270 --> 08:43:08,030
I can't believe it.

9689
08:43:10,000 --> 08:43:12,350
We were in the skies.

9690
08:43:13,230 --> 08:43:15,670
I was forced to look up.

9691
08:43:15,670 --> 08:43:18,150
I was like, please, you're so high up.

9692
08:43:18,230 --> 08:43:19,550
You're so high up.

9693
08:43:20,690 --> 08:43:23,050
We're not meant to look up.

9694
08:43:24,450 --> 08:43:26,570
That's why the sun is there.

9695
08:43:26,810 --> 08:43:28,550
We're not meant to look up.

9696
08:43:30,230 --> 08:43:31,430
Beware of the sun.

9697
08:43:34,250 --> 08:43:35,790
Beware of the sun.

9698
08:43:41,210 --> 08:43:42,450
Holy shit.

9699
08:43:42,450 --> 08:43:44,130
It's been a while.

9700
08:43:44,690 --> 08:43:45,870
8 hours.

9701
08:43:47,310 --> 08:43:49,550
Shout out to these gamers.

9702
08:43:50,130 --> 08:43:52,710
I hope they're okay, mentally.

9703
08:43:53,530 --> 08:43:54,730
I hope they're...

9704
08:43:57,170 --> 08:43:59,970
I hope they're okay.

9705
08:44:04,650 --> 08:44:07,510
They've been with me for 8 hours now.

9706
08:44:07,990 --> 08:44:09,030
Almost 9.

9707
08:44:10,130 --> 08:44:12,830
They've been here for almost 9 hours.

9708
08:44:17,310 --> 08:44:19,110
It'll be fine, right, guys?

9709
08:44:24,170 --> 08:44:25,870
It'll be so... Oh, he's dead.

9710
08:44:27,010 --> 08:44:27,610
He's...

9711
08:44:28,230 --> 08:44:28,770
He's dead.

9712
08:44:35,120 --> 08:44:36,040
Oh my god.

9713
08:44:36,200 --> 08:44:36,660
Oh my god.

9714
08:44:36,900 --> 08:44:37,680
Oh my god.

9715
08:44:38,760 --> 08:44:39,600
Oh my god.

9716
08:44:40,960 --> 08:44:41,980
I'm sorry.

9717
08:44:43,060 --> 08:44:44,680
I was looking at the Hulk.

9718
08:44:45,340 --> 08:44:46,740
Oh my god.

9719
08:44:51,220 --> 08:44:53,260
Sorry, I'm just...

9720
08:44:53,260 --> 08:44:54,820
There's a lot going on.

9721
08:44:55,040 --> 08:44:58,060
There's absolutely a lot going on in this game.

9722
08:44:59,040 --> 08:45:00,500
So I'm like...

9723
08:45:01,140 --> 08:45:03,840
I'm like trying to figure out what the fuck is happening.

9724
08:45:05,960 --> 08:45:08,300
I'm trying to figure it out right now.

9725
08:45:11,320 --> 08:45:12,520
Jesus Christ.

9726
08:45:23,030 --> 08:45:25,250
I'm so focused right now.

9727
08:45:25,450 --> 08:45:29,270
Holy fuck, I'm so focused at the moment.

9728
08:45:34,690 --> 08:45:35,170
Okay.

9729
08:45:41,400 --> 08:45:41,700
Okay.

9730
08:45:43,340 --> 08:45:44,520
That's fine.

9731
08:45:45,320 --> 08:45:45,780
That's fine.

9732
08:45:49,140 --> 08:45:51,800
Hello, I'm ready to dance, everybody.

9733
08:45:52,160 --> 08:45:53,180
Let's all...

9734
08:45:53,180 --> 08:45:54,620
Let's all... Oh.

9735
08:45:55,240 --> 08:45:56,320
Let's... Oh.

9736
08:45:57,080 --> 08:45:58,100
Hello, everyone.

9737
08:45:59,060 --> 08:45:59,760
Hello.

9738
08:46:01,980 --> 08:46:03,040
That's fine.

9739
08:46:03,820 --> 08:46:08,500
Okay, you're so healthy.

9740
08:46:09,620 --> 08:46:09,760
Oh.

9741
08:46:12,540 --> 08:46:13,480
It's alright.

9742
08:46:16,480 --> 08:46:17,460
It's alright.

9743
08:46:18,700 --> 08:46:19,860
Is he okay?

9744
08:46:21,100 --> 08:46:21,960
Oh.

9745
08:46:28,100 --> 08:46:28,280
Oh.

9746
08:46:31,040 --> 08:46:31,720
Oh.

9747
08:46:41,160 --> 08:46:42,860
That's a little awkward.

9748
08:46:43,720 --> 08:46:45,440
Heal me, heal me, heal me.

9749
08:46:45,900 --> 08:46:48,120
I mean, he literally got grabbed.

9750
08:46:48,900 --> 08:46:50,840
Like, I'd be afraid.

9751
08:46:52,940 --> 08:46:58,420
He literally got grabbed out of his fucking life by Hulk.

9752
08:46:58,520 --> 08:47:00,060
Like, that shit is traumatizing.

9753
08:47:00,240 --> 08:47:01,060
Hulk behind, Hulk behind.

9754
08:47:01,340 --> 08:47:01,860
I froze him.

9755
08:47:09,460 --> 08:47:10,940
Oh my god.

9756
08:47:11,900 --> 08:47:13,800
He's one, he's one.

9757
08:47:18,180 --> 08:47:18,620
The reload.

9758
08:47:22,140 --> 08:47:24,200
Oh my god, that was pretty cool.

9759
08:47:24,680 --> 08:47:25,380
I saw that.

9760
08:47:26,600 --> 08:47:28,380
Not gonna lie, that was pretty cool.

9761
08:47:31,040 --> 08:47:31,480
Okay.

9762
08:47:37,440 --> 08:47:39,340
He has his what on?

9763
08:47:43,060 --> 08:47:43,940
Yay!

9764
08:47:45,620 --> 08:47:46,240
Yes!

9765
08:47:46,860 --> 08:47:48,200
Dance, let's dance.

9766
08:47:48,280 --> 08:47:50,340
Let's fucking dance, everybody.

9767
08:47:50,660 --> 08:47:51,140
Let's...

9768
08:47:51,140 --> 08:47:51,380
Woo!

9769
08:47:51,640 --> 08:47:53,340
Free concert right here.

9770
08:47:53,860 --> 08:47:54,620
Let's go.

9771
08:47:56,440 --> 08:47:57,340
Wait, who's running?

9772
08:47:58,200 --> 08:47:58,760
There we go.

9773
08:48:00,720 --> 08:48:04,080
I thought he was like, I'm gonna use my girlfriend ult.

9774
08:48:04,160 --> 08:48:06,400
I was like, what the fuck is girlfriend ult?

9775
08:48:16,970 --> 08:48:17,410
Alright.

9776
08:48:20,710 --> 08:48:22,470
Alright, he's moving there now.

9777
08:48:27,440 --> 08:48:29,340
Oh my god, guys, I'm sorry, I have to really focus.

9778
08:48:29,620 --> 08:48:30,920
This is hell.

9779
08:48:32,660 --> 08:48:36,300
Healing Iron Man makes me have to focus even more than I should.

9780
08:48:37,380 --> 08:48:38,920
Because Iron Man is such a...

9781
08:48:39,580 --> 08:48:42,260
Like his move, he has to do so much movement shit.

9782
08:48:47,200 --> 08:48:49,460
Jesus, please.

9783
08:48:49,960 --> 08:48:50,840
Please live.

9784
08:48:51,360 --> 08:48:53,320
Please live.

9785
08:48:55,220 --> 08:48:56,060
Hulk one still, Hulk one.

9786
08:48:56,780 --> 08:48:57,600
Behind me.

9787
08:48:58,000 --> 08:48:58,240
No!

9788
08:49:04,020 --> 08:49:05,320
Oh my god.

9789
08:49:05,980 --> 08:49:07,920
Oh my god!

9790
08:49:11,520 --> 08:49:12,380
Time.

9791
08:49:13,650 --> 08:49:15,520
All I do is suffer.

9792
08:49:16,120 --> 08:49:17,980
All I do is suffer.

9793
08:49:19,280 --> 08:49:21,160
All I do is suffer.

9794
08:49:22,400 --> 08:49:25,480
All I do is suffer.

9795
08:49:26,120 --> 08:49:32,840
Oh my god, Oh my god, is he okay?

9796
08:49:33,420 --> 08:49:34,520
I can't tell.

9797
08:49:37,680 --> 08:49:39,060
I can't tell.

9798
08:49:40,720 --> 08:49:42,400
I can't... please.

9799
08:49:45,380 --> 08:49:45,760
I'm not here.

9800
08:49:45,860 --> 08:49:46,420
I'm gonna go this way.

9801
08:49:46,620 --> 08:49:47,120
I'm gonna go this way.

9802
08:49:47,620 --> 08:49:48,220
Okay.

9803
08:49:52,900 --> 08:49:53,500
Okay.

9804
08:49:53,500 --> 08:49:55,560
I'm... don't know what's going on.

9805
08:49:55,560 --> 08:50:01,830
I... I don't know what's going on, guys.

9806
08:50:09,000 --> 08:50:09,780
Behind us.

9807
08:50:10,380 --> 08:50:10,820
I'm frozen.

9808
08:50:10,960 --> 08:50:11,160
I'm frozen.

9809
08:50:15,990 --> 08:50:16,510
Okay.

9810
08:50:16,510 --> 08:50:18,050
Okay, that's not great.

9811
08:50:18,170 --> 08:50:19,230
That's not great at all.

9812
08:50:19,450 --> 08:50:20,370
That's not great.

9813
08:50:20,610 --> 08:50:22,510
That's not... that's not great.

9814
08:50:22,770 --> 08:50:23,970
That's not great, guys.

9815
08:50:24,130 --> 08:50:24,570
I...

9816
08:50:25,590 --> 08:50:26,110
No.

9817
08:50:26,270 --> 08:50:26,690
No.

9818
08:50:26,890 --> 08:50:27,410
No.

9819
08:50:27,750 --> 08:50:28,090
No.

9820
08:50:28,470 --> 08:50:29,770
I'm alive.

9821
08:50:37,950 --> 08:50:38,570
Okay.

9822
08:50:38,570 --> 08:50:38,750
Strange is low.

9823
08:50:38,850 --> 08:50:39,250
Strange is low.

9824
08:50:45,450 --> 08:50:46,070
Eww.

9825
08:50:47,630 --> 08:50:48,250
Okay.

9826
08:50:48,750 --> 08:50:49,050
Please.

9827
08:50:49,410 --> 08:50:49,810
Please.

9828
08:50:50,670 --> 08:50:52,690
Oh my god, I died.

9829
08:50:56,620 --> 08:50:57,020
Alright.

9830
08:50:57,760 --> 08:50:58,380
Okay.

9831
08:51:01,680 --> 08:51:04,560
I've never been so stressed in my life, everybody.

9832
08:51:04,780 --> 08:51:06,760
And like, I don't know what to do.

9833
08:51:08,640 --> 08:51:10,480
Bring me back to Squid Game.

9834
08:51:10,600 --> 08:51:13,820
Bring me back to Squid Game.

9835
08:51:19,040 --> 08:51:21,760
I'm at a B in Squid Game at this point.

9836
08:51:39,310 --> 08:51:39,790
Wait.

9837
08:51:39,870 --> 08:51:40,030
Strange.

9838
08:51:40,150 --> 08:51:40,250
Strange.

9839
08:51:40,390 --> 08:51:40,470
Strange.

9840
08:51:41,930 --> 08:51:42,650
Strange is low.

9841
08:51:42,690 --> 08:51:43,150
Strange is low.

9842
08:51:44,070 --> 08:51:44,510
Strange is one.

9843
08:51:44,590 --> 08:51:45,030
Strange is one.

9844
08:51:46,450 --> 08:51:47,450
There's a Hulk on cart.

9845
08:51:47,530 --> 08:51:48,830
There's a Hulk on cart.

9846
08:51:49,050 --> 08:51:49,450
Please.

9847
08:51:56,990 --> 08:51:58,170
Oh my god.

9848
08:52:02,190 --> 08:52:03,090
Oh my god.

9849
08:52:03,210 --> 08:52:03,210
Oh my god.

9850
08:52:03,210 --> 08:52:04,650
That game was so stressful.

9851
08:52:06,390 --> 08:52:07,710
Oh my god.

9852
08:52:07,970 --> 08:52:09,170
That game was so stressful.

9853
08:52:14,170 --> 08:52:15,350
That game.

9854
08:52:16,490 --> 08:52:18,210
Oh my god, that game.

9855
08:52:22,750 --> 08:52:23,990
Oh my god.

9856
08:52:25,210 --> 08:52:26,970
Oh my god, did we get it?

9857
08:52:28,290 --> 08:52:30,890
215 is... Are we in the cutoff?

9858
08:52:33,110 --> 08:52:34,450
Oh my god.

9859
08:52:37,970 --> 08:52:38,810
Where am I?

9860
08:52:39,570 --> 08:52:40,290
Yeah!

9861
08:52:41,650 --> 08:52:43,490
We did it!

9862
08:52:44,110 --> 08:52:45,650
Guys, are you looking?

9863
08:52:46,530 --> 08:52:48,630
Guys, but it's not over yet.

9864
08:52:48,770 --> 08:52:51,030
Guys, it's not over yet.

9865
08:52:51,170 --> 08:52:52,550
Because we still have the M500.

9866
08:52:53,570 --> 08:52:57,250
So we need two more wins.

9867
08:52:58,150 --> 08:53:00,850
We need two more wins to secure it.

9868
08:53:01,390 --> 08:53:03,110
We're almost there.

9869
08:53:04,230 --> 08:53:07,270
We're almost... Oh my god, 333.

9870
08:53:07,270 --> 08:53:09,030
I'm fucking a degenerate.

9871
08:53:09,110 --> 08:53:11,090
I'm actually a degenerate.

9872
08:53:13,290 --> 08:53:15,530
Do you have the most games played?

9873
08:53:15,670 --> 08:53:17,970
No, thank god these guys exist.

9874
08:53:18,330 --> 08:53:18,970
Thank god.

9875
08:53:19,110 --> 08:53:21,110
Oh, thank you doctor for...

9876
08:53:21,110 --> 08:53:22,710
Oh, thank you.

9877
08:53:23,050 --> 08:53:27,850
I have 333 wins.

9878
08:53:28,250 --> 08:53:29,930
That's way too many.

9879
08:53:30,330 --> 08:53:31,710
Brosa, thank you for the 150.

9880
08:53:31,970 --> 08:53:33,110
Thank you, thank you.

9881
08:53:33,470 --> 08:53:35,630
Zesty and Hero, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

9882
08:53:35,630 --> 08:53:37,490
Pomio, thank you for the tier one sub.

9883
08:53:37,610 --> 08:53:38,630
Thank you, thank you.

9884
08:53:39,410 --> 08:53:40,470
Oh my god.

9885
08:53:40,710 --> 08:53:42,430
Oh my god, there I am.

9886
08:53:44,030 --> 08:53:45,370
There I am.

9887
08:53:46,050 --> 08:53:48,270
Guys, here I go.

9888
08:53:48,690 --> 08:53:50,450
We did it, everybody.

9889
08:53:50,770 --> 08:53:52,430
We fucking did it.

9890
08:53:53,530 --> 08:53:55,450
This is how I feel right now.

9891
08:54:00,250 --> 08:54:02,150
Wait, I have a better idea.

9892
08:54:09,770 --> 08:54:11,850
Wait, because I don't have the toggle.

9893
08:54:12,250 --> 08:54:16,630
I don't have... Wait, actually, before we do it, let me grab...

9894
08:54:20,590 --> 08:54:23,410
Look at me, that's me over there, right there.

9895
08:54:23,470 --> 08:54:24,930
Oh my god, did you see this?

9896
08:54:25,170 --> 08:54:26,130
That's me.

9897
08:54:26,510 --> 08:54:27,710
That's me.

9898
08:54:28,590 --> 08:54:31,090
Do another nine hours.

9899
08:54:33,390 --> 08:54:34,630
Oh my god.

9900
08:54:35,730 --> 08:54:36,810
Where did it go?

9901
08:54:36,810 --> 08:54:38,990
Oh, I was fucking...

9902
08:54:39,710 --> 08:54:40,670
Holy shit.

9903
08:54:40,770 --> 08:54:41,410
Hey, it's Kassadin.

9904
08:54:41,550 --> 08:54:43,190
Oh my god, it's Wakanda again.

9905
08:54:43,470 --> 08:54:44,510
It's fucking Wakanda.

9906
08:54:45,330 --> 08:54:46,790
There he is.

9907
08:54:50,990 --> 08:54:52,290
Wakanda came back.

9908
08:54:53,790 --> 08:54:54,550
Okay, guys.

9909
08:54:55,310 --> 08:54:57,770
Okay, but what if I'm gonna disappear for a little bit?

9910
08:54:58,350 --> 08:55:00,350
I'm gonna disappear for a little bit, guys.

9911
08:55:00,930 --> 08:55:02,430
Guys, don't worry, I'm still here.

9912
08:55:02,890 --> 08:55:04,090
Don't worry, I'm still here.

9913
08:55:04,150 --> 08:55:05,910
I just need to add something.

9914
08:55:05,910 --> 08:55:08,650
I just need to...

9915
08:55:08,650 --> 08:55:11,170
Let me add something real quick, guys.

9916
08:55:12,250 --> 08:55:13,590
Okay, let's see.

9917
08:55:14,330 --> 08:55:15,490
Right here.

9918
08:55:15,870 --> 08:55:16,910
And then...

9919
08:55:18,970 --> 08:55:19,570
Okay.

9920
08:55:21,550 --> 08:55:23,170
Let me see, where is it?

9921
08:55:23,330 --> 08:55:23,630
Alright.

9922
08:55:24,530 --> 08:55:25,110
Don't worry.

9923
08:55:25,890 --> 08:55:27,010
It'll be so worth it.

9924
08:55:27,090 --> 08:55:28,850
It's basically how I feel right now.

9925
08:55:29,350 --> 08:55:29,950
It's...

9926
08:55:33,570 --> 08:55:36,470
It's basically how we all feel at the moment.

9927
08:55:39,750 --> 08:55:41,710
My god, what did I name it?

9928
08:55:42,490 --> 08:55:44,750
What the fuck did I name this?

9929
08:55:45,910 --> 08:55:46,790
Oh, there it is.

9930
08:55:46,930 --> 08:55:48,090
I named it image21.

9931
08:55:48,770 --> 08:55:49,890
That makes sense.

9932
08:56:01,770 --> 08:56:02,610
Wait, okay.

9933
08:56:03,450 --> 08:56:07,230
Okay, let me...

9934
08:56:07,230 --> 08:56:08,570
Okay, give me a sec.

9935
08:56:08,690 --> 08:56:09,950
Let me adjust this.

9936
08:56:09,950 --> 08:56:12,030
Better than me.

9937
08:56:14,750 --> 08:56:15,670
There we go.

9938
08:56:16,050 --> 08:56:23,130
That's how I feel right now.

9939
08:56:26,630 --> 08:56:27,650
Oh my god.

9940
08:56:28,730 --> 08:56:30,210
Are you okay?

9941
08:56:30,730 --> 08:56:32,990
I'm so okay, guys.

9942
08:56:33,090 --> 08:56:35,230
I don't know why you don't think I'm okay.

9943
08:56:35,590 --> 08:56:36,550
I don't know.

9944
08:56:37,690 --> 08:56:40,090
I don't know why you don't think I'm...

9945
08:56:40,090 --> 08:56:40,950
Oh, where did it go?

9946
08:56:41,010 --> 08:56:41,810
Oh shit.

9947
08:56:42,230 --> 08:56:43,550
Oh shit, where did it...

9948
08:56:43,550 --> 08:56:44,550
Oh my god, it disappeared.

9949
08:56:45,150 --> 08:56:46,670
I don't know what happened.

9950
08:56:46,710 --> 08:56:47,430
It disappeared.

9951
08:56:51,210 --> 08:56:52,930
Sorry, I don't know what happened to it.

9952
08:56:52,950 --> 08:56:53,550
It actually disappeared.

9953
08:56:59,230 --> 08:57:02,970
It flew away into the trade.

9954
08:57:07,330 --> 08:57:08,810
Immersion ruined.

9955
08:57:10,570 --> 08:57:12,230
Where did it go?

9956
08:57:12,630 --> 08:57:14,710
Wait, where did it go?

9957
08:57:20,890 --> 08:57:22,650
I don't know what happened.

9958
08:57:24,310 --> 08:57:25,510
I'm scared.

9959
08:57:25,710 --> 08:57:27,170
I'm scared of Wakanda.

9960
08:57:29,030 --> 08:57:30,210
It looks like...

9961
08:57:31,390 --> 08:57:32,650
I like how that looked.

9962
08:57:32,790 --> 08:57:35,530
That sounded really bad at a content.

9963
08:57:38,890 --> 08:57:39,970
You don't understand.

9964
08:57:40,330 --> 08:57:40,930
I'm scared.

9965
08:57:41,850 --> 08:57:43,270
I went through so much.

9966
08:57:49,910 --> 08:57:51,370
Oh my god.

9967
08:57:52,650 --> 08:57:54,270
Oh my god.

9968
08:57:58,130 --> 08:57:59,150
Where are you?

9969
08:58:00,030 --> 08:58:00,550
Where are you?

9970
08:58:03,130 --> 08:58:03,970
Where are you?

9971
08:58:08,210 --> 08:58:09,110
Where are you?

9972
08:58:12,370 --> 08:58:13,350
Oh my god.

9973
08:58:17,150 --> 08:58:18,670
Take a nap.

9974
08:58:19,370 --> 08:58:19,850
Here we go.

9975
08:58:22,550 --> 08:58:23,890
That's unlucky.

9976
08:58:33,430 --> 08:58:34,730
That's unlucky.

9977
08:58:35,550 --> 08:58:36,380
That's unlucky.

9978
08:58:36,850 --> 08:58:39,130
I didn't think he was gonna eye me.

9979
08:58:41,590 --> 08:58:43,330
Hey, Wakanda's on Groot.

9980
08:58:43,870 --> 08:58:45,490
You know what, that's fine.

9981
08:58:45,930 --> 08:58:46,990
Oh, that's not fine.

9982
08:58:46,990 --> 08:58:47,110
What?

9983
08:58:48,310 --> 08:58:49,650
That's not fine.

9984
08:58:54,910 --> 08:58:56,930
Am I addicted to this game?

9985
08:58:59,470 --> 08:59:00,150
I'm...

9986
08:59:00,150 --> 08:59:00,470
Hmm.

9987
08:59:02,550 --> 08:59:04,330
If you'd say addiction as a...

9988
08:59:04,330 --> 08:59:04,590
Whoa.

9989
08:59:05,530 --> 08:59:06,630
I'm gonna sit here.

9990
08:59:08,710 --> 08:59:09,750
Addiction is...

9991
08:59:09,750 --> 08:59:13,190
Are you saying it in a negative way?

9992
08:59:23,250 --> 08:59:24,170
Oh my god.

9993
08:59:24,250 --> 08:59:25,610
He fucking shielded it.

9994
08:59:26,350 --> 08:59:27,830
He shielded it.

9995
08:59:30,970 --> 08:59:31,570
Whoa.

9996
08:59:31,790 --> 08:59:32,150
Whoa.

9997
08:59:32,410 --> 08:59:32,890
Whoa.

9998
08:59:33,310 --> 08:59:33,790
Whoa.

9999
08:59:34,330 --> 08:59:34,990
Is you okay?

10000
08:59:37,090 --> 08:59:38,130
Oh my god.

10001
08:59:38,190 --> 08:59:38,630
I swear.

10002
08:59:38,930 --> 08:59:39,430
I fucking...

10003
08:59:39,430 --> 08:59:40,310
I will burn every tree.

10004
08:59:45,590 --> 08:59:45,950
I swear.

10005
08:59:46,390 --> 08:59:47,690
What am I stuck on?

10006
08:59:52,230 --> 08:59:52,810
I...

10007
08:59:52,810 --> 08:59:53,510
I...

10008
09:00:00,490 --> 09:00:01,570
That's unlucky.

10009
09:00:01,930 --> 09:00:03,840
You can't do anything about it.

10010
09:00:06,640 --> 09:00:08,340
How did he get his ult so...

10011
09:00:08,340 --> 09:00:09,600
He got his ult so fast.

10012
09:00:10,180 --> 09:00:11,160
Like, the...

10013
09:00:11,160 --> 09:00:13,320
The Luna and I haven't even got it yet.

10014
09:00:14,860 --> 09:00:16,020
That's crazy.

10015
09:00:21,840 --> 09:00:22,420
Please.

10016
09:00:27,520 --> 09:00:28,420
Alright.

10017
09:00:28,840 --> 09:00:29,660
Here we go.

10018
09:00:33,520 --> 09:00:34,180
First...

10019
09:00:34,180 --> 09:00:34,640
Yay!

10020
09:00:39,150 --> 09:00:39,600
Oh

10021
09:00:46,250 --> 09:00:47,510
my god.

10022
09:00:53,090 --> 09:00:54,270
That's fine.

10023
09:00:55,930 --> 09:00:59,210
Why is this group still doing his stuff?

10024
09:01:01,510 --> 09:01:02,970
Holy fuck.

10025
09:01:03,070 --> 09:01:03,250
Okay.

10026
09:01:06,190 --> 09:01:07,970
This is so stressful, guys.

10027
09:01:08,110 --> 09:01:08,950
This is...

10028
09:01:09,710 --> 09:01:12,350
As we get closer and closer to 250.

10029
09:01:13,210 --> 09:01:13,770
It's...

10030
09:01:13,770 --> 09:01:15,750
These games are getting actual gamer.

10031
09:01:16,110 --> 09:01:17,510
I can't fuck around, guys.

10032
09:01:17,610 --> 09:01:18,990
I can't fuck around anymore.

10033
09:01:22,330 --> 09:01:29,850
Remember when we could fuck around and we could have conversation and then we watch mom and dad get the worst live on stream?

10034
09:01:30,430 --> 09:01:32,650
Those were the good old days.

10035
09:01:35,410 --> 09:01:37,430
Remember those days?

10036
09:01:46,350 --> 09:01:49,510
I don't think we use it here.

10037
09:01:51,010 --> 09:01:54,110
I don't remember that one.

10038
09:01:54,910 --> 09:01:56,050
I remember.

10039
09:01:57,070 --> 09:01:58,990
We all died so fast there.

10040
09:01:59,410 --> 09:02:00,210
Can we touch here now?

10041
09:02:00,210 --> 09:02:00,230
No.

10042
09:02:04,730 --> 09:02:05,410
Alright.

10043
09:02:06,330 --> 09:02:07,010
I'm okay, I'm okay.

10044
09:02:08,830 --> 09:02:09,510
Oh.

10045
09:02:13,350 --> 09:02:14,590
I slept him.

10046
09:02:16,470 --> 09:02:17,350
I'm dead.

10047
09:02:17,770 --> 09:02:19,790
I don't know what happened to me.

10048
09:02:20,610 --> 09:02:21,850
What happened to me?

10049
09:02:25,130 --> 09:02:27,290
Remember those good old days?

10050
09:02:27,870 --> 09:02:28,950
I remember.

10051
09:02:30,970 --> 09:02:32,250
Okay, do you not see nothing?

10052
09:02:33,450 --> 09:02:33,790
No.

10053
09:02:38,400 --> 09:02:40,180
Now games are...

10054
09:02:40,180 --> 09:02:41,560
Now games are so sweaty.

10055
09:02:42,400 --> 09:02:43,760
Games are actually gaming now.

10056
09:02:45,760 --> 09:02:46,460
Woah.

10057
09:02:48,740 --> 09:02:51,080
Oh, this fruit is...

10058
09:02:51,080 --> 09:02:51,400
Oh.

10059
09:02:51,640 --> 09:02:51,960
Woah.

10060
09:02:55,140 --> 09:02:56,120
I'm scared.

10061
09:03:00,260 --> 09:03:01,220
Change path.

10062
09:03:07,450 --> 09:03:08,410
Oh my god.

10063
09:03:10,970 --> 09:03:11,710
Wake up.

10064
09:03:11,810 --> 09:03:12,210
Wake up.

10065
09:03:12,290 --> 09:03:12,830
Wake up.

10066
09:03:16,800 --> 09:03:17,280
He's asleep.

10067
09:03:17,440 --> 09:03:18,080
He's asleep.

10068
09:03:25,510 --> 09:03:26,410
It's a dream.

10069
09:03:26,570 --> 09:03:26,990
Wake up.

10070
09:03:27,070 --> 09:03:27,850
It's not real.

10071
09:03:35,170 --> 09:03:36,030
It's fine.

10072
09:03:41,330 --> 09:03:42,610
I did it.

10073
09:03:44,850 --> 09:03:45,490
Wait, wait.

10074
09:03:45,610 --> 09:03:46,090
They're C9.

10075
09:03:46,170 --> 09:03:46,670
We're C9.

10076
09:03:49,050 --> 09:03:49,610
Go.

10077
09:03:49,710 --> 09:03:49,850
Go.

10078
09:03:49,990 --> 09:03:50,150
Go.

10079
09:03:50,330 --> 09:03:51,210
I damaged most of you.

10080
09:03:53,230 --> 09:03:53,790
Okay.

10081
09:03:59,150 --> 09:04:02,550
Wait, they portaled.

10082
09:04:04,190 --> 09:04:05,230
There's a stranger stream.

10083
09:04:07,270 --> 09:04:08,330
Nice pop.

10084
09:04:12,370 --> 09:04:13,490
Oh my god.

10085
09:04:14,270 --> 09:04:14,830
C9.

10086
09:04:16,450 --> 09:04:17,630
I'm freaking C9.

10087
09:04:18,830 --> 09:04:19,510
Holy shit.

10088
09:04:19,830 --> 09:04:21,050
That was so close.

10089
09:04:26,230 --> 09:04:30,150
Oh, fucking rat.

10090
09:04:30,270 --> 09:04:31,490
That was such a ratty play.

10091
09:04:36,530 --> 09:04:37,950
TheSpaceDrake, thank you for tier one.

10092
09:04:38,090 --> 09:04:38,890
Thank you, thank you.

10093
09:04:39,650 --> 09:04:41,130
Brando, thank you for the gifted sub.

10094
09:04:41,210 --> 09:04:41,830
Thank you, thank you.

10095
09:04:41,910 --> 09:04:43,230
1RO, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

10096
09:04:43,410 --> 09:04:44,870
Shaggy, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

10097
09:04:45,290 --> 09:04:47,150
JayMay, thank you for the 5 gifted subs.

10098
09:04:47,330 --> 09:04:49,350
And Classy, thank you for the 5 gifted subs.

10099
09:04:49,610 --> 09:04:50,390
Oh my gosh, there's more.

10100
09:04:50,490 --> 09:04:51,570
You have 5, 6, 7, 8.

10101
09:04:51,910 --> 09:04:53,130
Thank you for the 8 gifted subs.

10102
09:04:53,310 --> 09:04:55,530
Oh my god, there's so many things happened while I was freaking out.

10103
09:04:56,010 --> 09:04:57,990
McCrim, thank you for the 5 gifted subs.

10104
09:04:58,110 --> 09:04:59,070
Thank you, thank you.

10105
09:05:00,290 --> 09:05:01,750
I really appreciate it, guys.

10106
09:05:02,130 --> 09:05:02,490
C9.

10107
09:05:02,650 --> 09:05:03,870
Basically, C9 is...

10108
09:05:06,570 --> 09:05:07,630
Wait, guys.

10109
09:05:07,770 --> 09:05:08,390
Oh my god.

10110
09:05:08,510 --> 09:05:10,570
I couldn't tap back into my game for a sec.

10111
09:05:10,650 --> 09:05:11,410
I was...

10112
09:05:11,410 --> 09:05:13,790
I was freaking out.

10113
09:05:16,030 --> 09:05:19,030
I almost couldn't tap back into the game.

10114
09:05:19,910 --> 09:05:20,230
Alright.

10115
09:05:20,610 --> 09:05:21,870
So, basically...

10116
09:05:24,210 --> 09:05:26,030
C9 is basically...

10117
09:05:26,030 --> 09:05:30,390
Back in Overwatch days, there was a team that would always forget about the...

10118
09:05:30,390 --> 09:05:31,170
Get back-capped.

10119
09:05:31,730 --> 09:05:32,770
And it was...

10120
09:05:32,770 --> 09:05:34,270
It was Surefour's team.

10121
09:05:34,710 --> 09:05:35,890
So, he lives through it.

10122
09:05:36,150 --> 09:05:39,030
So, his team would get, like, back-capped.

10123
09:05:39,690 --> 09:05:40,890
And we would...

10124
09:05:40,890 --> 09:05:42,710
Like, several times in the tournament.

10125
09:05:43,030 --> 09:05:44,530
And then, because of it...

10126
09:05:44,530 --> 09:05:45,730
It's called C9.

10127
09:05:45,870 --> 09:05:47,370
Because it was from Cloud9.

10128
09:05:48,490 --> 09:05:48,910
Right.

10129
09:05:53,310 --> 09:05:53,930
Wait, what?

10130
09:05:54,610 --> 09:05:56,410
Wait, there's a Psylocke right here.

10131
09:05:57,550 --> 09:05:58,230
Right here.

10132
09:05:59,230 --> 09:06:00,630
He's just poking us for free.

10133
09:06:02,350 --> 09:06:03,130
He's low.

10134
09:06:03,390 --> 09:06:09,750
I just left him.

10135
09:06:12,330 --> 09:06:13,030
The Strange is low.

10136
09:06:13,110 --> 09:06:13,530
Strange is low.

10137
09:06:14,610 --> 09:06:15,350
Strange is still low.

10138
09:06:15,590 --> 09:06:15,970
He's half.

10139
09:06:17,850 --> 09:06:18,170
Okay.

10140
09:06:19,290 --> 09:06:19,930
Nevermind.

10141
09:06:21,310 --> 09:06:23,010
We don't care about that Strange.

10142
09:06:29,530 --> 09:06:30,110
Woah.

10143
09:06:32,190 --> 09:06:32,830
Woah.

10144
09:06:33,150 --> 09:06:34,290
Woah, there.

10145
09:06:34,650 --> 09:06:35,350
Woah, there.

10146
09:06:43,300 --> 09:06:44,300
Woah, okay.

10147
09:06:46,060 --> 09:06:46,900
Oh, he's coming for you.

10148
09:06:53,670 --> 09:06:54,750
Oh my god.

10149
09:06:56,450 --> 09:06:57,970
I'm waiting for my leaves.

10150
09:06:59,270 --> 09:07:00,130
Give me health, give me health.

10151
09:07:00,710 --> 09:07:01,210
Oh, nevermind.

10152
09:07:01,510 --> 09:07:02,870
Oh, I gave you a leaf.

10153
09:07:06,050 --> 09:07:07,030
You're welled up, you're welled up.

10154
09:07:07,230 --> 09:07:08,030
Yeah, you're welled up.

10155
09:07:08,150 --> 09:07:08,810
I can't get to you.

10156
09:07:14,870 --> 09:07:15,230
Okay.

10157
09:07:15,690 --> 09:07:16,490
You can measure it.

10158
09:07:19,410 --> 09:07:20,090
I'll match it.

10159
09:07:24,670 --> 09:07:25,690
I see sleeping.

10160
09:07:28,230 --> 09:07:28,990
Keep going, keep going.

10161
09:07:28,990 --> 09:07:32,110
Come on, Groot.

10162
09:07:35,490 --> 09:07:36,770
There's a Lunar Chair left.

10163
09:07:39,450 --> 09:07:40,270
Oh my god.

10164
09:07:42,270 --> 09:07:43,450
Why is she still alive?

10165
09:07:47,270 --> 09:07:49,290
She lived for so long.

10166
09:07:49,950 --> 09:07:50,950
I'm just looking.

10167
09:07:51,130 --> 09:07:52,250
I'm like, are you guys okay?

10168
09:07:52,370 --> 09:07:53,690
There's four of you and one Luna.

10169
09:07:55,990 --> 09:07:58,510
I'm like, there's four of you.

10170
09:07:58,510 --> 09:07:59,650
Are you guys okay?

10171
09:08:06,350 --> 09:08:07,430
That's pretty cool.

10172
09:08:07,590 --> 09:08:08,210
That's neat.

10173
09:08:08,810 --> 09:08:10,510
Oh my god, I'm trying to do it to the...

10174
09:08:13,550 --> 09:08:13,930
Alright.

10175
09:08:18,430 --> 09:08:20,270
Whoa, where did the Psylocke go?

10176
09:08:20,450 --> 09:08:21,490
I don't ever know.

10177
09:08:27,330 --> 09:08:28,410
The grid is half.

10178
09:08:28,570 --> 09:08:29,490
I'm damage boosting you for it.

10179
09:08:31,030 --> 09:08:32,390
Oh, I'm so sorry.

10180
09:08:36,910 --> 09:08:37,670
Backing up.

10181
09:08:38,170 --> 09:08:38,770
Keep going.

10182
09:08:40,070 --> 09:08:41,530
We were a little bit too deep.

10183
09:08:45,550 --> 09:08:46,070
Whoa.

10184
09:08:55,120 --> 09:08:56,160
You're still...

10185
09:08:56,160 --> 09:08:57,540
I slept.

10186
09:08:57,700 --> 09:08:58,280
Oh, I didn't sleep.

10187
09:09:00,520 --> 09:09:03,060
Whoa, let's go, let's...

10188
09:09:03,060 --> 09:09:03,760
Where am I?

10189
09:09:03,840 --> 09:09:04,680
Who's my Luna?

10190
09:09:05,220 --> 09:09:05,540
What?

10191
09:09:06,880 --> 09:09:07,520
Oh.

10192
09:09:08,180 --> 09:09:09,220
That's lucky.

10193
09:09:09,920 --> 09:09:10,760
Grid slow, grid slow.

10194
09:09:12,640 --> 09:09:13,940
Did I grab it off?

10195
09:09:14,160 --> 09:09:14,640
I guess.

10196
09:09:15,120 --> 09:09:15,340
Whoa!

10197
09:09:22,620 --> 09:09:24,380
Oh my god.

10198
09:09:25,440 --> 09:09:29,160
I'm like, I got it off, but then they did everything.

10199
09:09:33,030 --> 09:09:34,650
Am I shooting anything?

10200
09:09:34,970 --> 09:09:35,910
I can't tell.

10201
09:09:39,510 --> 09:09:40,190
It's fine.

10202
09:09:44,330 --> 09:09:45,730
They used it in the first engagement.

10203
09:09:46,710 --> 09:09:48,170
Oh, they got it.

10204
09:09:50,550 --> 09:09:51,850
Oh my god.

10205
09:09:55,510 --> 09:09:56,990
Are you serious?

10206
09:10:01,550 --> 09:10:02,390
Okay,

10207
09:10:06,230 --> 09:10:06,530
goodbye.

10208
09:10:09,090 --> 09:10:09,650
Goodbye.

10209
09:10:10,230 --> 09:10:11,910
Oh my god, goodbye.

10210
09:10:17,370 --> 09:10:18,670
Wait, how did you die?

10211
09:10:20,390 --> 09:10:21,610
Okay, this is fine.

10212
09:10:23,890 --> 09:10:26,690
Oh my god, how did I jump so high?

10213
09:10:26,870 --> 09:10:28,190
I feel like a star.

10214
09:10:30,290 --> 09:10:31,350
They have grid all soon.

10215
09:10:33,090 --> 09:10:33,590
Oh.

10216
09:10:33,770 --> 09:10:34,770
Oh, thank god.

10217
09:10:35,810 --> 09:10:37,010
Oh, thank god.

10218
09:10:39,630 --> 09:10:41,430
I can't see anything!

10219
09:10:42,070 --> 09:10:43,530
Grid one, grid one!

10220
09:10:44,210 --> 09:10:44,650
Oh.

10221
09:10:45,410 --> 09:10:45,850
Oh.

10222
09:10:49,090 --> 09:10:49,530
Nice.

10223
09:10:50,070 --> 09:10:51,270
Oh my god, nice!

10224
09:10:51,330 --> 09:10:51,790
How did we live?

10225
09:10:53,230 --> 09:10:54,070
How did we live?

10226
09:10:54,090 --> 09:10:54,810
They still have no sportals.

10227
09:10:54,910 --> 09:10:55,690
They're gonna be close though.

10228
09:10:56,590 --> 09:10:56,850
Yeah.

10229
09:10:58,750 --> 09:10:59,790
I don't know how I lived that.

10230
09:11:00,470 --> 09:11:00,850
I don't know.

10231
09:11:01,710 --> 09:11:03,070
I don't know how I lived that.

10232
09:11:04,950 --> 09:11:05,790
Damage boost here.

10233
09:11:12,320 --> 09:11:12,760
Oh.

10234
09:11:14,080 --> 09:11:15,040
Oh my god.

10235
09:11:15,040 --> 09:11:18,360
Oh my god, what the fuck happened?

10236
09:11:19,220 --> 09:11:19,360
What?

10237
09:11:19,680 --> 09:11:20,760
What's going on?

10238
09:11:22,020 --> 09:11:23,340
Let's change our point, let's change our point.

10239
09:11:23,860 --> 09:11:24,420
Okay.

10240
09:11:25,800 --> 09:11:27,420
Oh my god.

10241
09:11:29,640 --> 09:11:32,280
I don't know what's going on anymore.

10242
09:11:32,480 --> 09:11:33,380
I just...

10243
09:11:33,380 --> 09:11:35,580
There's too many stuff on my screen.

10244
09:11:40,240 --> 09:11:41,680
Oh my god.

10245
09:11:43,260 --> 09:11:46,380
There's way too much stuff on my screen.

10246
09:11:46,880 --> 09:11:48,960
That shit was a fucking shitshow.

10247
09:11:51,960 --> 09:11:56,580
That was actually a fucking shitshow what I had to watch there.

10248
09:11:58,200 --> 09:12:00,000
Alright, time for the real game.

10249
09:12:00,440 --> 09:12:01,600
Alright, intermission's over.

10250
09:12:02,400 --> 09:12:03,320
Intermission's over.

10251
09:12:03,640 --> 09:12:05,740
We're ready for our true passion.

10252
09:12:06,580 --> 09:12:06,720
Alright.

10253
09:12:11,000 --> 09:12:11,440
Alright.

10254
09:12:13,240 --> 09:12:13,680
Alright.

10255
09:12:13,680 --> 09:12:14,720
Back to the real game.

10256
09:12:15,260 --> 09:12:17,900
We time for the main event.

10257
09:12:19,400 --> 09:12:20,280
We did it.

10258
09:12:20,980 --> 09:12:22,580
Finally, it's shrimping time.

10259
09:12:23,220 --> 09:12:24,200
Time to push some children.

10260
09:12:24,540 --> 09:12:25,000
You're right.

10261
09:12:25,200 --> 09:12:25,920
Do I have to buy it again?

10262
09:12:26,000 --> 09:12:26,420
No, okay.

10263
09:12:26,920 --> 09:12:27,180
Okay.

10264
09:12:27,960 --> 09:12:29,060
Oh, what can I have?

10265
09:12:29,140 --> 09:12:30,420
Oh, I can buy these?

10266
09:12:30,560 --> 09:12:31,520
How much is it?

10267
09:12:32,680 --> 09:12:33,120
Cosmetics?

10268
09:12:33,640 --> 09:12:33,960
Products?

10269
09:12:34,460 --> 09:12:36,240
Wait, I want a...

10270
09:12:36,240 --> 09:12:36,900
Fifty...

10271
09:12:36,900 --> 09:12:37,840
Ten mil?

10272
09:12:38,440 --> 09:12:40,080
Who's wearing one right now?

10273
09:12:43,360 --> 09:12:44,700
Ten mil?

10274
09:12:44,800 --> 09:12:46,700
Nobody can afford that.

10275
09:12:49,120 --> 09:12:50,580
Oh my god.

10276
09:12:51,960 --> 09:12:54,300
Sir, this is squid game, sir.

10277
09:12:55,740 --> 09:12:56,860
Sir, this is...

10278
09:12:56,860 --> 09:12:57,820
This is...

10279
09:12:57,820 --> 09:12:59,540
Get it out, bro.

10280
09:13:03,780 --> 09:13:05,080
What is this?

10281
09:13:05,080 --> 09:13:05,900
I just got here.

10282
09:13:05,960 --> 09:13:07,020
Look, we're...

10283
09:13:07,020 --> 09:13:07,720
Queues are long.

10284
09:13:07,760 --> 09:13:08,700
Okay, guys?

10285
09:13:08,900 --> 09:13:09,660
Queues are long.

10286
09:13:09,760 --> 09:13:10,740
So, we gotta...

10287
09:13:10,740 --> 09:13:13,160
We gotta make time pass by.

10288
09:13:14,520 --> 09:13:18,840
I cannot be in the training range for another 15 minutes.

10289
09:13:22,820 --> 09:13:24,860
I cannot do that, guys.

10290
09:13:25,960 --> 09:13:26,980
Alright, here we go.

10291
09:13:27,060 --> 09:13:28,000
Oh my god, there's Goku.

10292
09:13:29,100 --> 09:13:29,940
Oh my god.

10293
09:13:30,000 --> 09:13:30,520
Hey, Goku.

10294
09:13:31,620 --> 09:13:33,600
Don't get mad my cosmetic doesn't show up.

10295
09:13:35,400 --> 09:13:36,340
I'm just...

10296
09:13:36,340 --> 09:13:37,800
I'm just Mr. Roblox guy.

10297
09:13:40,760 --> 09:13:43,620
Oh my god, Goku from Dragon Ball and Squid Game?

10298
09:13:43,700 --> 09:13:44,420
What number is Goku?

10299
09:13:44,760 --> 09:13:45,460
Number 40?

10300
09:13:46,320 --> 09:13:47,020
Alright, number 40.

10301
09:13:47,060 --> 09:13:47,920
I'm 224.

10302
09:13:48,760 --> 09:13:50,540
Low-key chill guy.

10303
09:13:53,000 --> 09:13:53,560
Wait.

10304
09:13:54,160 --> 09:13:54,880
How come his...

10305
09:13:54,880 --> 09:13:56,240
Did he pay for this game?

10306
09:13:57,200 --> 09:13:58,820
Why is he in a tuxedo?

10307
09:14:00,600 --> 09:14:02,700
Is Goku a do-less?

10308
09:14:04,840 --> 09:14:06,520
Wait, why are they in tuxedos?

10309
09:14:06,580 --> 09:14:07,420
What the fuck?

10310
09:14:10,480 --> 09:14:11,260
Alright, I'm ready.

10311
09:14:11,460 --> 09:14:12,280
We're gonna win a game.

10312
09:14:12,380 --> 09:14:13,520
We're gonna win this Squid Game.

10313
09:14:14,160 --> 09:14:15,120
I'm fucking ready.

10314
09:14:33,600 --> 09:14:34,200
How do I skip?

10315
09:14:35,200 --> 09:14:35,680
Skip.

10316
09:14:38,040 --> 09:14:39,780
Why is the police there?

10317
09:14:40,200 --> 09:14:40,720
Skippity.

10318
09:14:41,000 --> 09:14:41,780
Oh my god.

10319
09:14:43,040 --> 09:14:44,320
Oh my god.

10320
09:14:44,740 --> 09:14:45,900
These are actual children.

10321
09:14:46,100 --> 09:14:47,620
Did you guys see like the exhibit?

10322
09:14:48,400 --> 09:14:48,920
Where...

10323
09:14:49,500 --> 09:14:50,240
In Korea.

10324
09:14:50,560 --> 09:14:51,860
And they put out like this little...

10325
09:14:51,860 --> 09:14:54,220
A children exhibit of Squid Game.

10326
09:14:54,320 --> 09:14:57,420
And then all the kids were like posing with like the guards and stuff.

10327
09:14:57,480 --> 09:14:58,700
As if like...

10328
09:14:58,700 --> 09:14:59,560
What?

10329
09:15:06,680 --> 09:15:08,040
How do I push?

10330
09:15:12,540 --> 09:15:13,520
Alright, I'm pushing.

10331
09:15:13,660 --> 09:15:14,180
I'm ready to push.

10332
09:15:14,240 --> 09:15:14,840
I'm ready to push you.

10333
09:15:14,900 --> 09:15:15,580
I'm gonna fucking push you.

10334
09:15:19,060 --> 09:15:21,900
Why would you cheat in Squid?

10335
09:15:23,980 --> 09:15:24,480
Why?

10336
09:15:24,760 --> 09:15:28,040
Why would you cheat in Squid Game?

10337
09:15:29,340 --> 09:15:31,020
In Roblox Squid Game.

10338
09:15:33,480 --> 09:15:35,200
I think somebody has a sound.

10339
09:15:35,320 --> 09:15:36,100
Oh, there was a loud noise.

10340
09:15:36,100 --> 09:15:36,640
Like a lag spike.

10341
09:15:36,780 --> 09:15:37,400
I was like, what?

10342
09:15:38,400 --> 09:15:38,860
Push, push, push.

10343
09:15:38,940 --> 09:15:39,260
Come on.

10344
09:15:39,720 --> 09:15:40,720
Let me push you.

10345
09:15:43,440 --> 09:15:44,080
Let me push you.

10346
09:15:44,080 --> 09:15:44,600
Let me push you.

10347
09:15:47,370 --> 09:15:49,410
Bro, that's fucked.

10348
09:15:49,750 --> 09:15:50,850
That's so fucked.

10349
09:15:51,370 --> 09:15:52,830
I wanted to push.

10350
09:15:54,150 --> 09:15:55,310
Oh my god.

10351
09:15:56,410 --> 09:15:57,750
Oh my god.

10352
09:15:58,310 --> 09:16:00,610
I didn't get to use it.

10353
09:16:01,050 --> 09:16:02,490
I'm gonna use my push now.

10354
09:16:03,230 --> 09:16:04,790
I'm so sad.

10355
09:16:06,450 --> 09:16:07,790
I'm so sad.

10356
09:16:10,370 --> 09:16:13,110
Look at all these dead people over there.

10357
09:16:13,990 --> 09:16:15,690
Damn, she almost died.

10358
09:16:16,550 --> 09:16:17,970
Alright, what's our next game?

10359
09:16:18,670 --> 09:16:19,750
How did you get here?

10360
09:16:20,470 --> 09:16:20,730
What?

10361
09:16:21,650 --> 09:16:23,030
Why were you out here already?

10362
09:16:25,250 --> 09:16:26,590
Alright, grief the children.

10363
09:16:26,710 --> 09:16:28,930
We haven't got the umbrella yet, so I think we're fine.

10364
09:16:31,330 --> 09:16:32,190
Thank god.

10365
09:16:32,190 --> 09:16:34,710
I think we got all the shapes, but the umbrella.

10366
09:16:36,170 --> 09:16:38,090
Yeah, how the fuck did he get here before us?

10367
09:16:39,890 --> 09:16:43,350
I wanna know what the Mona Lisa looks like.

10368
09:16:45,970 --> 09:16:46,270
Yeah.

10369
09:16:46,790 --> 09:16:48,330
Not the Mona Lisa.

10370
09:16:54,720 --> 09:16:55,280
Alright.

10371
09:16:55,860 --> 09:16:56,200
Oh.

10372
09:17:02,740 --> 09:17:03,340
Oh.

10373
09:17:03,340 --> 09:17:03,440
Oh.

10374
09:17:05,500 --> 09:17:07,780
Okay, guys, I gotta lock in.

10375
09:17:09,680 --> 09:17:11,720
It's one out of four!

10376
09:17:14,980 --> 09:17:16,160
We can do this.

10377
09:17:20,590 --> 09:17:23,630
Guys, we have a minute, so it can't be that bad.

10378
09:17:24,110 --> 09:17:28,230
I play video games for a living, so I have the hand-eye coordination for this.

10379
09:17:31,910 --> 09:17:33,550
I have a minute, guys.

10380
09:17:34,470 --> 09:17:40,550
Guys, I have stable fingers, so it's fine.

10381
09:17:47,730 --> 09:17:49,650
Slow and steady.

10382
09:17:59,400 --> 09:18:00,280
It's fine.

10383
09:18:00,400 --> 09:18:00,920
It's okay.

10384
09:18:02,300 --> 09:18:03,260
Oh my god.

10385
09:18:03,560 --> 09:18:04,660
I thought that was me.

10386
09:18:05,160 --> 09:18:05,760
I thought...

10387
09:18:05,760 --> 09:18:07,820
Oh, it was the guy next to me.

10388
09:18:09,580 --> 09:18:10,860
Holy fuck.

10389
09:18:11,260 --> 09:18:12,080
I thought...

10390
09:18:12,080 --> 09:18:14,520
It was the guy next to me.

10391
09:18:14,540 --> 09:18:16,180
Oh my god.

10392
09:18:17,200 --> 09:18:18,320
Holy shit.

10393
09:18:18,820 --> 09:18:20,780
I thought I fucked it up.

10394
09:18:20,880 --> 09:18:22,420
Like, at the finish line.

10395
09:18:23,360 --> 09:18:24,360
Oh my god.

10396
09:18:24,440 --> 09:18:26,340
My soul left my body.

10397
09:18:26,660 --> 09:18:27,360
Bro, same.

10398
09:18:27,900 --> 09:18:29,240
Oh my god.

10399
09:18:29,380 --> 09:18:30,680
That died me.

10400
09:18:31,320 --> 09:18:33,200
I legitimately thought it was me.

10401
09:18:34,020 --> 09:18:34,900
That was crazy.

10402
09:18:35,000 --> 09:18:35,920
That was fucking crazy.

10403
09:18:36,060 --> 09:18:38,020
It was the guy next to me that died.

10404
09:18:39,780 --> 09:18:40,660
Holy shit.

10405
09:18:40,900 --> 09:18:42,120
That stressed me out.

10406
09:18:43,280 --> 09:18:44,620
Yeah, that scared me.

10407
09:18:45,100 --> 09:18:46,700
That really scared me there.

10408
09:18:47,860 --> 09:18:48,480
Alright, here we go.

10409
09:18:48,540 --> 09:18:49,560
That was a movie.

10410
09:18:50,440 --> 09:18:51,180
Right there.

10411
09:18:54,450 --> 09:18:54,730
Alright.

10412
09:18:55,010 --> 09:18:57,590
That $1,900,000.

10413
09:18:57,810 --> 09:18:58,290
That's mine.

10414
09:18:59,170 --> 09:19:00,090
I can feel it.

10415
09:19:00,870 --> 09:19:01,750
I think...

10416
09:19:01,750 --> 09:19:02,650
I think this is it.

10417
09:19:02,870 --> 09:19:05,370
I think this is the moment where I'm gonna get that money.

10418
09:19:06,410 --> 09:19:07,090
Oh, did Goku die?

10419
09:19:07,130 --> 09:19:07,610
Oh my god.

10420
09:19:07,650 --> 09:19:08,290
Yeah, that's me.

10421
09:19:08,350 --> 09:19:08,690
That's me.

10422
09:19:08,690 --> 09:19:09,350
Guys.

10423
09:19:10,330 --> 09:19:10,870
Yeah.

10424
09:19:11,710 --> 09:19:12,390
I'm with Thanos.

10425
09:19:14,090 --> 09:19:14,930
Bing, bing.

10426
09:19:15,270 --> 09:19:16,130
Bing, bing, bing.

10427
09:19:16,370 --> 09:19:17,170
What a riddle.

10428
09:19:17,310 --> 09:19:18,170
Bing, bing, bing.

10429
09:19:19,490 --> 09:19:20,170
Yeah!

10430
09:19:23,950 --> 09:19:24,630
Yeah!

10431
09:19:26,710 --> 09:19:27,050
Yeah!

10432
09:19:28,890 --> 09:19:29,290
Yeah!

10433
09:19:38,770 --> 09:19:39,490
Guys, please.

10434
09:19:39,730 --> 09:19:40,290
We got...

10435
09:19:40,290 --> 09:19:41,090
Guys, I'm scared.

10436
09:19:41,270 --> 09:19:41,650
Guys.

10437
09:19:42,190 --> 09:19:43,950
Guys, I'm a little scared.

10438
09:19:44,110 --> 09:19:44,470
Guys.

10439
09:19:44,610 --> 09:19:45,590
What if...

10440
09:19:45,590 --> 09:19:46,610
What if...

10441
09:19:46,610 --> 09:19:47,090
You know.

10442
09:19:48,950 --> 09:19:50,850
This song is going to...

10443
09:19:52,670 --> 09:19:53,510
There's three of us.

10444
09:19:53,630 --> 09:19:54,410
There's three of us.

10445
09:19:54,510 --> 09:19:55,310
There's three of us.

10446
09:19:55,490 --> 09:19:56,110
Oh, thank god.

10447
09:19:56,150 --> 09:19:56,830
We made it.

10448
09:19:56,990 --> 09:19:58,030
Did anyone else not make it?

10449
09:19:58,390 --> 09:19:59,830
Did anyone else not make it?

10450
09:20:00,030 --> 09:20:01,850
Oh, there's that one guy right...

10451
09:20:11,910 --> 09:20:12,870
Oh!

10452
09:20:14,950 --> 09:20:15,990
That poor guy.

10453
09:20:19,450 --> 09:20:20,710
There you go.

10454
09:20:20,890 --> 09:20:21,370
Yeah!

10455
09:20:22,470 --> 09:20:23,430
Yeah!

10456
09:20:26,510 --> 09:20:26,990
Yeah!

10457
09:20:29,810 --> 09:20:30,210
Yeah!

10458
09:20:30,750 --> 09:20:31,210
Yeah!

10459
09:20:33,210 --> 09:20:34,970
Nothing bad's gonna happen to...

10460
09:20:39,770 --> 09:20:40,730
We're fine.

10461
09:20:41,750 --> 09:20:42,150
Yay.

10462
09:20:43,050 --> 09:20:43,450
See?

10463
09:20:44,270 --> 09:20:45,270
Everything's okay.

10464
09:20:46,690 --> 09:20:48,470
Everything is okay.

10465
09:20:49,770 --> 09:20:50,930
I think everybody made it.

10466
09:20:51,010 --> 09:20:51,870
Everybody made it.

10467
09:20:52,070 --> 09:20:52,830
Nobody died.

10468
09:20:53,210 --> 09:20:53,390
Oh.

10469
09:20:53,790 --> 09:20:55,490
Except for whoever that guy was.

10470
09:20:55,890 --> 09:20:57,910
Except for whoever that guy was.

10471
09:20:59,210 --> 09:20:59,810
Yeah, boy.

10472
09:21:00,050 --> 09:21:00,630
And pay it.

10473
09:21:00,690 --> 09:21:01,910
Thank you for the Twitch prom.

10474
09:21:02,010 --> 09:21:02,250
Thank you.

10475
09:21:02,890 --> 09:21:04,390
Thank you for the gifted sub.

10476
09:21:04,890 --> 09:21:05,590
Another one?

10477
09:21:06,250 --> 09:21:06,770
Okay.

10478
09:21:06,770 --> 09:21:06,810
Okay.

10479
09:21:14,330 --> 09:21:14,770
Yeah.

10480
09:21:16,930 --> 09:21:17,370
Yeah.

10481
09:21:21,960 --> 09:21:22,720
This is mine.

10482
09:21:22,920 --> 09:21:23,400
This is mine.

10483
09:21:23,540 --> 09:21:24,020
This is mine.

10484
09:21:24,160 --> 09:21:24,500
Yes!

10485
09:21:24,760 --> 09:21:25,120
No!

10486
09:21:25,480 --> 09:21:26,040
This is mine.

10487
09:21:26,220 --> 09:21:26,800
This is mine.

10488
09:21:27,000 --> 09:21:27,820
This is mine.

10489
09:21:28,120 --> 09:21:29,020
This is mine!

10490
09:21:29,700 --> 09:21:30,600
Oh my god.

10491
09:21:30,880 --> 09:21:31,840
Holy shit.

10492
09:21:32,320 --> 09:21:32,740
Oh my god.

10493
09:21:32,760 --> 09:21:33,200
I made it.

10494
09:21:33,480 --> 09:21:34,300
I made it.

10495
09:21:36,080 --> 09:21:37,320
Oh my god.

10496
09:21:38,960 --> 09:21:40,020
Someone died.

10497
09:21:40,200 --> 09:21:40,800
She did it.

10498
09:21:40,860 --> 09:21:41,240
Make it.

10499
09:21:41,320 --> 09:21:42,200
That poor woman.

10500
09:21:42,700 --> 09:21:43,540
That poor woman.

10501
09:21:45,120 --> 09:21:45,640
I'm sorry.

10502
09:21:45,760 --> 09:21:47,460
That child lived next to the server.

10503
09:21:47,580 --> 09:21:48,260
There's no way.

10504
09:21:49,180 --> 09:21:51,120
That child actually lived next to the server.

10505
09:21:52,980 --> 09:21:56,380
More stressful than the top 500 tried.

10506
09:21:58,760 --> 09:22:00,740
Almost betrayed by the ping.

10507
09:22:01,420 --> 09:22:01,680
There.

10508
09:22:01,680 --> 09:22:04,540
That child lives next to the Roblox servers.

10509
09:22:04,760 --> 09:22:05,680
It's understandable.

10510
09:22:07,000 --> 09:22:12,220
There's only a two, four, six, eight of us left.

10511
09:22:13,100 --> 09:22:15,160
There's only eight of us left.

10512
09:22:16,740 --> 09:22:20,680
And I'm gonna win that 2.3 million dollars.

10513
09:22:23,560 --> 09:22:24,280
Alright.

10514
09:22:24,640 --> 09:22:26,940
Oh, is this the glass bridge again?

10515
09:22:27,120 --> 09:22:29,880
Guys, nobody's gonna fucking make it through.

10516
09:22:30,780 --> 09:22:32,320
There's no way.

10517
09:22:33,000 --> 09:22:36,000
I don't think- and there's no way.

10518
09:22:37,460 --> 09:22:39,800
This is way too long.

10519
09:22:40,140 --> 09:22:43,040
That bridge is way too fucking long in general.

10520
09:22:43,900 --> 09:22:46,900
All right, somebody make- he's examining.

10521
09:22:47,820 --> 09:22:48,500
He's...

10522
09:22:49,300 --> 09:22:49,980
He's...

10523
09:22:49,980 --> 09:22:51,980
Examining the bridges right now.

10524
09:22:52,160 --> 09:22:53,160
Like, do it kitty cat.

10525
09:22:53,820 --> 09:22:55,720
Come on, examine that bridge.

10526
09:22:56,060 --> 09:22:57,520
What do your eyes tell you?

10527
09:23:00,440 --> 09:23:01,160
All right.

10528
09:23:03,180 --> 09:23:03,960
All right.

10529
09:23:08,830 --> 09:23:11,050
What do your other eyes say- I'm just gonna wait here.

10530
09:23:11,270 --> 09:23:14,950
I- like, if they make it all the way to the end, then I'll be impressed.

10531
09:23:17,190 --> 09:23:19,910
Come on, what do you- playing chicken right now?

10532
09:23:22,290 --> 09:23:24,510
Let's just- Okay.

10533
09:23:25,430 --> 09:23:27,950
Feel like I'm gonna miss the jump too, I feel like.

10534
09:23:28,390 --> 09:23:29,630
I feel like that's gonna happen.

10535
09:23:30,350 --> 09:23:31,770
I'm just gonna miss the jump.

10536
09:23:33,070 --> 09:23:33,990
Come on, do it.

10537
09:23:34,090 --> 09:23:35,090
Do it, be a hero.

10538
09:23:36,950 --> 09:23:38,670
Be a hero, guys.

10539
09:23:40,730 --> 09:23:41,970
You got it.

10540
09:23:42,810 --> 09:23:43,170
Oh.

10541
09:23:45,550 --> 09:23:47,430
Now I'm scared of missing this.

10542
09:23:49,150 --> 09:23:50,210
Be a hero.

10543
09:23:54,430 --> 09:23:57,090
He did not got- come on!

10544
09:23:58,050 --> 09:23:59,990
Make the- did he just eat?

10545
09:24:00,830 --> 09:24:01,470
I don't eat too.

10546
09:24:02,070 --> 09:24:02,750
What do I eat?

10547
09:24:05,170 --> 09:24:06,490
I have it selected.

10548
09:24:11,070 --> 09:24:12,510
Oh, he did it.

10549
09:24:14,210 --> 09:24:14,870
All right.

10550
09:24:15,550 --> 09:24:17,130
Aw, that's all right, buddy.

10551
09:24:18,390 --> 09:24:19,750
That's why you're a sheep.

10552
09:24:19,870 --> 09:24:20,870
You gotta be a sheep.

10553
09:24:21,710 --> 09:24:22,610
Eat a honeycomb.

10554
09:24:22,830 --> 09:24:25,370
I- it's like right at the bottom, but I don't know how to eat yet.

10555
09:24:26,250 --> 09:24:26,690
Oh.

10556
09:24:28,950 --> 09:24:30,190
So you gotta be a sheep.

10557
09:24:31,890 --> 09:24:35,130
Gotta let all these guys die for the cause.

10558
09:24:39,010 --> 09:24:41,150
Come on, there's three left.

10559
09:24:41,770 --> 09:24:43,030
There's four left.

10560
09:24:43,190 --> 09:24:46,790
There's four left and there's- Wait, where did that other guy go?

10561
09:24:46,790 --> 09:24:49,190
There's four left and there's five of us.

10562
09:24:49,990 --> 09:24:50,830
Come on.

10563
09:24:53,730 --> 09:24:55,930
Do it, you know you want to.

10564
09:24:56,570 --> 09:24:59,070
Come on, you don't want to be a sheep no more.

10565
09:24:59,770 --> 09:25:03,790
Aren't you tired of living this monstrous life following orders?

10566
09:25:05,090 --> 09:25:08,170
Don't you want to, you know, make a name for yourself?

10567
09:25:09,190 --> 09:25:09,630
Pfft.

10568
09:25:10,790 --> 09:25:12,850
He's just like, parkour!

10569
09:25:14,470 --> 09:25:16,350
Does he even remember which one?

10570
09:25:18,470 --> 09:25:19,510
Parkour!

10571
09:25:24,290 --> 09:25:25,410
I can wait.

10572
09:25:25,930 --> 09:25:27,290
I can wait forever.

10573
09:25:36,810 --> 09:25:38,850
Oh, last one.

10574
09:25:41,590 --> 09:25:42,670
Come on.

10575
09:25:44,450 --> 09:25:45,830
It's you and me.

10576
09:25:47,050 --> 09:25:48,990
Wait, oh, he had a revive?

10577
09:25:50,050 --> 09:25:51,510
Bro, that's cheating!

10578
09:25:52,350 --> 09:25:53,350
You have revive?

10579
09:25:55,700 --> 09:25:57,360
I'm back from squid game?

10580
09:25:57,880 --> 09:26:01,660
You can't just- That's not in the rules of squid game.

10581
09:26:01,900 --> 09:26:03,640
If you lose, you lose.

10582
09:26:04,340 --> 09:26:05,770
If you lose, you lose.

10583
09:26:09,280 --> 09:26:11,680
You're already rich, what do you need the money for?

10584
09:26:12,060 --> 09:26:15,900
You're already- You're already rich.

10585
09:26:15,900 --> 09:26:17,520
What do you need the- Oh!

10586
09:26:17,780 --> 09:26:19,640
The rich people telling me!

10587
09:26:19,820 --> 09:26:22,740
The non-VIP to go first!

10588
09:26:23,080 --> 09:26:23,720
Wow!

10589
09:26:24,480 --> 09:26:26,080
I see how it is!

10590
09:26:26,280 --> 09:26:28,540
I fucking see how- Of course!

10591
09:26:28,840 --> 09:26:32,760
You see me, the non-tuxedo guy!

10592
09:26:33,400 --> 09:26:35,340
You want me to go- No.

10593
09:26:36,380 --> 09:26:36,860
No.

10594
09:26:37,180 --> 09:26:38,400
That ain't it, buddy.

10595
09:26:39,040 --> 09:26:40,580
That ain't fucking it.

10596
09:26:45,900 --> 09:26:46,560
Come on.

10597
09:26:49,440 --> 09:26:51,100
Alright guys, 50-50.

10598
09:26:52,740 --> 09:26:54,060
It wasn't left!

10599
09:26:54,200 --> 09:26:56,380
You're right, it wasn't- Okay, I'm gonna do it.

10600
09:26:56,860 --> 09:26:59,500
I'm gonna do it in 20 seconds.

10601
09:26:59,780 --> 09:27:01,260
If I do it, I win everything.

10602
09:27:25,450 --> 09:27:26,070
Oh my god!

10603
09:27:26,670 --> 09:27:28,730
The rich gets richer!

10604
09:27:29,750 --> 09:27:33,370
The rich just simply get richer!

10605
09:27:37,630 --> 09:27:39,350
I knew it!

10606
09:27:39,610 --> 09:27:42,390
We'll never climb out of the slums!

10607
09:27:44,250 --> 09:27:46,330
And the poor gets poor.

10608
09:27:46,790 --> 09:27:49,650
Of course the tuxedo men win this!

10609
09:27:50,030 --> 09:27:53,250
What a cruel way to crash out.

10610
09:27:55,450 --> 09:27:57,570
I'm just a pawn in their sick games.

10611
09:27:58,270 --> 09:27:59,730
I truly am.

10612
09:28:00,310 --> 09:28:01,830
I truly am.

10613
09:28:04,210 --> 09:28:06,970
Not in squid game.

10614
09:28:07,090 --> 09:28:08,350
You don't eat anything.

10615
09:28:08,630 --> 09:28:10,250
You just die.

10616
09:28:14,370 --> 09:28:16,690
Oh my god.

10617
09:28:17,030 --> 09:28:18,630
It's so cruel.

10618
09:28:19,310 --> 09:28:21,730
Life really is cruel.

10619
09:28:25,850 --> 09:28:27,710
Oh my god.

10620
09:28:29,150 --> 09:28:30,830
What's my record right now?

10621
09:28:31,170 --> 09:28:35,830
What's my actual- Oh my god, I've never seen a road this bright before.

10622
09:28:38,270 --> 09:28:43,170
I've never seen a road this bright and beautiful in my life.

10623
09:28:43,290 --> 09:28:44,590
It's actually crazy.

10624
09:28:45,030 --> 09:28:49,810
You guys don't see it right now, but like- I have a golden road of victories.

10625
09:28:50,070 --> 09:28:55,210
And it's so- It's- I've never seen it before.

10626
09:28:57,570 --> 09:29:01,310
I'm playing the real game.

10627
09:29:03,570 --> 09:29:06,730
I'm playing a game that truly matters in my life.

10628
09:29:07,750 --> 09:29:09,430
The yellow brick road.

10629
09:29:11,590 --> 09:29:12,390
Alright.

10630
09:29:12,910 --> 09:29:13,410
Here we go.

10631
09:29:14,310 --> 09:29:15,110
That's right.

10632
09:29:16,070 --> 09:29:18,670
With 12 year olds and their mom's credit cards.

10633
09:29:18,670 --> 09:29:22,390
One of them paid me off the throw.

10634
09:29:25,390 --> 09:29:28,770
Two tuxedo men told me to take the jump and I did.

10635
09:29:29,070 --> 09:29:31,090
I thought I could finally be rich.

10636
09:29:31,270 --> 09:29:32,110
Just like them.

10637
09:29:34,670 --> 09:29:36,250
And then I got baited.

10638
09:29:36,430 --> 09:29:38,670
And then the rich one-

10639
09:29:41,750 --> 09:29:44,530
Sniped me in Squid Game Roblox.

10640
09:29:52,470 --> 09:29:53,130
Please.

10641
09:29:54,310 --> 09:29:55,870
Please, we need one win, guys.

10642
09:29:55,990 --> 09:29:57,010
Just one win.

10643
09:29:57,090 --> 09:29:58,890
We made it so far.

10644
09:29:59,210 --> 09:30:04,530
We actually- We actually made it so far.

10645
09:30:10,580 --> 09:30:13,520
You know our estimated queue time was two minutes?

10646
09:30:13,620 --> 09:30:14,760
It's been 17 minutes.

10647
09:30:15,440 --> 09:30:17,260
I played these games.

10648
09:30:18,320 --> 09:30:18,880
Before.

10649
09:30:21,120 --> 09:30:22,020
How do I push?

10650
09:30:24,240 --> 09:30:25,880
Oh my god, he just pushed her.

10651
09:30:28,560 --> 09:30:31,700
This is a long- Whoa.

10652
09:30:34,800 --> 09:30:35,940
Hello, sorry, buddy.

10653
09:30:37,000 --> 09:30:38,580
Whoa, sorry, buddy.

10654
09:30:38,820 --> 09:30:39,700
You pushed somebody.

10655
09:30:40,020 --> 09:30:41,100
Oh my god.

10656
09:30:41,100 --> 09:30:41,240
Wait.

10657
09:30:42,160 --> 09:30:43,360
He's just pushing.

10658
09:30:46,660 --> 09:30:47,260
No.

10659
09:30:48,700 --> 09:30:49,300
What?

10660
09:30:50,260 --> 09:30:52,860
That's it, that's it, that's it.

10661
09:30:53,120 --> 09:30:54,000
God, please.

10662
09:30:56,240 --> 09:30:57,380
Oh my god.

10663
09:31:00,100 --> 09:31:02,680
Let me push, let me push, let me push.

10664
09:31:02,820 --> 09:31:03,780
How do you push?

10665
09:31:06,920 --> 09:31:08,300
I made it.

10666
09:31:08,300 --> 09:31:09,260
I made it.

10667
09:31:09,720 --> 09:31:11,780
Make a wall, make a wall.

10668
09:31:11,920 --> 09:31:12,900
Don't let them through.

10669
09:31:13,380 --> 09:31:14,380
Make a wall.

10670
09:31:15,700 --> 09:31:16,600
Make a wall.

10671
09:31:16,620 --> 09:31:17,980
Oh my god.

10672
09:31:19,300 --> 09:31:21,440
Make a wall, don't let them through.

10673
09:31:22,320 --> 09:31:23,240
That's right.

10674
09:31:26,260 --> 09:31:27,100
I don't know.

10675
09:31:27,120 --> 09:31:28,180
I still don't know how to push.

10676
09:31:28,540 --> 09:31:31,000
I still don't know how to use the push button.

10677
09:31:31,140 --> 09:31:33,240
How do you use the push button?

10678
09:31:35,760 --> 09:31:37,320
How do you use the push button?

10679
09:31:37,320 --> 09:31:39,200
Guys, did anyone else play this?

10680
09:31:39,600 --> 09:31:42,600
Does anyone know what the push button is?

10681
09:31:43,660 --> 09:31:44,380
Is it F?

10682
09:31:45,680 --> 09:31:46,240
E?

10683
09:31:46,320 --> 09:31:46,960
It's not E.

10684
09:31:47,180 --> 09:31:49,020
I tried E, but it's not E.

10685
09:31:49,220 --> 09:31:50,320
It won't let me push.

10686
09:31:52,260 --> 09:31:53,080
Maybe it's F.

10687
09:31:53,180 --> 09:31:54,440
I'll try F next time.

10688
09:31:54,980 --> 09:31:56,100
I have a million dollars.

10689
09:31:56,660 --> 09:31:57,060
Nice.

10690
09:31:58,740 --> 09:31:59,700
Oh, fuck that tuxedo.

10691
09:31:59,700 --> 09:32:01,760
I can't believe I paid to win that.

10692
09:32:01,920 --> 09:32:03,440
That's actually crazy.

10693
09:32:03,900 --> 09:32:04,560
I'm sad.

10694
09:32:08,200 --> 09:32:08,800
Alright.

10695
09:32:09,200 --> 09:32:09,900
Here we go.

10696
09:32:15,980 --> 09:32:17,200
Yay, circle!

10697
09:32:17,840 --> 09:32:18,880
The easiest one.

10698
09:32:23,360 --> 09:32:23,960
Alright.

10699
09:32:25,460 --> 09:32:26,940
Oh, you're looking at me.

10700
09:32:28,500 --> 09:32:30,160
Alright, here we go.

10701
09:32:34,550 --> 09:32:35,270
That's right.

10702
09:32:35,610 --> 09:32:40,030
I have the perfect hand-eye coordination.

10703
09:32:42,790 --> 09:32:45,730
I've done the umbrella.

10704
09:32:46,390 --> 09:32:48,130
I've done the star.

10705
09:32:48,710 --> 09:32:50,790
And I've done the triangle.

10706
09:32:51,970 --> 09:32:54,910
There's nowhere else to go but up.

10707
09:32:56,370 --> 09:32:57,130
Woah.

10708
09:32:58,970 --> 09:33:01,130
This is a little stressful.

10709
09:33:01,130 --> 09:33:01,870
Oh, thank god.

10710
09:33:02,050 --> 09:33:03,650
No one got shot.

10711
09:33:04,050 --> 09:33:05,150
Good for them.

10712
09:33:33,390 --> 09:33:36,090
Oh my god.

10713
09:33:36,190 --> 09:33:36,390
Oh my god.

10714
09:33:36,390 --> 09:33:37,590
That poor child.

10715
09:33:37,590 --> 09:33:39,770
That poor child.

10716
09:33:40,170 --> 09:33:42,550
I thought he made it.

10717
09:33:42,790 --> 09:33:44,190
He got up.

10718
09:33:44,570 --> 09:33:46,890
I thought he made it just like me.

10719
09:33:47,910 --> 09:33:50,110
What did I do?

10720
09:33:52,070 --> 09:33:54,750
I was just happy for us.

10721
09:33:56,670 --> 09:33:59,190
I get the Mona Lisa.

10722
09:34:00,870 --> 09:34:02,730
The doki curse lives on.

10723
09:34:03,530 --> 09:34:04,830
It lives on.

10724
09:34:04,830 --> 09:34:06,970
Star looking.

10725
09:34:09,650 --> 09:34:10,270
Yay!

10726
09:34:26,710 --> 09:34:30,230
That song is so addicting.

10727
09:34:30,610 --> 09:34:32,450
Like, it's in the earworm.

10728
09:34:32,450 --> 09:34:34,450
It's like the...

10729
09:34:37,490 --> 09:34:39,450
This song is such an earworm.

10730
09:34:40,530 --> 09:34:41,330
This is a long queue.

10731
09:34:41,410 --> 09:34:42,370
How long has the queue been?

10732
09:34:43,490 --> 09:34:44,110
It's been...

10733
09:34:44,110 --> 09:34:45,310
Oh, they restarted the queue.

10734
09:34:45,530 --> 09:34:48,930
Oh, the estimated time has now become unknown.

10735
09:34:49,430 --> 09:34:50,870
Oh my god.

10736
09:34:51,170 --> 09:34:51,970
Oh, yeah!

10737
09:34:54,850 --> 09:34:55,390
Yeah!

10738
09:34:58,490 --> 09:34:59,890
Yeah!

10739
09:35:08,730 --> 09:35:08,930
Yeah!

10740
09:35:10,990 --> 09:35:11,230

10741
09:35:13,050 --> 09:35:13,750
Yeah!

10742
09:35:25,390 --> 09:35:27,170
Ba -dum, ba-dum, ba-dum.

10743
09:35:28,750 --> 09:35:30,350
No, no, no, no!

10744
09:35:30,770 --> 09:35:31,690
Oh my god.

10745
09:35:32,010 --> 09:35:33,730
The match popped up.

10746
09:35:34,850 --> 09:35:35,590
Oh my god.

10747
09:35:37,630 --> 09:35:39,690
Go, go, go, go.

10748
09:35:39,910 --> 09:35:41,090
Please, we need one more.

10749
09:35:44,220 --> 09:35:45,280
Oh, we did it.

10750
09:35:46,020 --> 09:35:46,700
We did it.

10751
09:35:46,740 --> 09:35:47,380
We got in.

10752
09:35:47,880 --> 09:35:49,020
We got in.

10753
09:35:50,460 --> 09:35:51,280
It's okay.

10754
09:35:53,060 --> 09:35:53,840
Oh my god.

10755
09:35:53,840 --> 09:35:55,760
Oh my god.

10756
09:35:56,100 --> 09:35:57,480
Oh, he still thinks he's Adam.

10757
09:35:57,780 --> 09:36:02,920
Is everybody okay?

10758
09:36:05,420 --> 09:36:08,460
Ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum.

10759
09:36:15,240 --> 09:36:15,720
Yeah!

10760
09:36:17,220 --> 09:36:18,060
Yeah!

10761
09:36:21,700 --> 09:36:22,660
Yeah!

10762
09:36:25,680 --> 09:36:27,260
Please, please, somebody come in.

10763
09:36:27,460 --> 09:36:28,280
Help me be my friend.

10764
09:36:28,680 --> 09:36:29,220
Friends!

10765
09:36:30,160 --> 09:36:30,760
Yay!

10766
09:36:33,480 --> 09:36:34,080
Friends!

10767
09:36:35,740 --> 09:36:36,340
Friends!

10768
09:36:36,880 --> 09:36:38,240
It's okay, we still have time.

10769
09:36:39,080 --> 09:36:41,300
I want to make sure other people...

10770
09:36:41,300 --> 09:36:45,780
I want to cuck other people from these doors before I leave.

10771
09:36:47,360 --> 09:36:51,620
I want to make sure these other children die before I leave.

10772
09:36:56,160 --> 09:36:56,640
Yeah!

10773
09:36:56,720 --> 09:36:59,380
Ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum.

10774
09:36:59,660 --> 09:37:01,520
Ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum.

10775
09:37:01,520 --> 09:37:02,740
Ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum.

10776
09:37:02,740 --> 09:37:04,300
Oh shit, do I miss a lucky hero?

10777
09:37:05,700 --> 09:37:06,500
There we go.

10778
09:37:06,800 --> 09:37:07,380
Oh shit.

10779
09:37:08,500 --> 09:37:08,980
No!

10780
09:37:10,200 --> 09:37:11,260
I'm down, I'm down!

10781
09:37:13,320 --> 09:37:14,020
Get in!

10782
09:37:14,200 --> 09:37:14,640
Get in!

10783
09:37:16,510 --> 09:37:17,130

10784
09:37:17,210 --> 09:37:17,890
Get in there!

10785
09:37:18,130 --> 09:37:18,570
Please!

10786
09:37:19,330 --> 09:37:19,810

Get in!

10788
09:37:28,210 --> 09:37:29,070
Yay!

10789
09:37:32,030 --> 09:37:33,290
Holy shit!

10790
09:37:34,790 --> 09:37:35,650
Yippee!

10791
09:37:38,890 --> 09:37:40,270
We did it!

10792
09:37:41,830 --> 09:37:43,010
We did it!

10793
09:37:43,490 --> 09:37:44,630
Alright, now I leave.

10794
09:37:45,950 --> 09:37:47,540
I'm happy that I...

10795
09:37:47,690 --> 09:37:50,070
that I got two people killed.

10796
09:37:50,860 --> 09:37:51,290
That...

10797
09:37:51,290 --> 09:37:53,490
Thank you, brother.

10798
09:37:53,490 --> 09:37:54,830
I love you.

10799
09:37:57,610 --> 09:37:59,610
I'm happy about that.

10800
09:37:59,810 --> 09:38:01,870
Two people died because of me.

10801
09:38:05,190 --> 09:38:06,730
Oh my god.

10802
09:38:09,250 --> 09:38:11,050
Like, nothing happened.

10803
09:38:12,330 --> 09:38:13,210
It was worth it.

10804
09:38:13,330 --> 09:38:14,710
It was so worth it, honestly.

10805
09:38:16,410 --> 09:38:17,530
Oh my god.

10806
09:38:17,550 --> 09:38:18,590
What's going on?

10807
09:38:18,650 --> 09:38:19,730
I can't tell.

10808
09:38:23,390 --> 09:38:24,810
I feel down.

10809
09:38:27,510 --> 09:38:28,430
Oh shit.

10810
09:38:29,150 --> 09:38:30,110
It's strangers though.

10811
09:38:35,950 --> 09:38:37,010
I'm capping point.

10812
09:38:38,850 --> 09:38:40,070
Oh my god.

10813
09:38:40,890 --> 09:38:42,830
Guys, I'm so locked in.

10814
09:38:42,970 --> 09:38:47,210
Guys, after destroying those children, nothing can stop me now.

10815
09:38:47,790 --> 09:38:47,890
Nothing!

10816
09:38:49,990 --> 09:38:51,010
Damn, no!

10817
09:38:52,290 --> 09:38:56,150
After After ruining those kids' time and watching them.

10818
09:38:58,810 --> 09:39:00,470
Legitimately just watching them.

10819
09:39:01,890 --> 09:39:02,610
Wait.

10820
09:39:03,290 --> 09:39:04,150
Oh my...

10821
09:39:04,150 --> 09:39:06,070
Oh my god.

10822
09:39:06,350 --> 09:39:09,610
I was like, those sound like... that sound like footsteps.

10823
09:39:14,290 --> 09:39:15,390
What the hell?

10824
09:39:20,150 --> 09:39:20,950
Oh.

10825
09:39:24,510 --> 09:39:25,390
Yeah, man.

10826
09:39:27,670 --> 09:39:29,690
I'll let you run out first.

10827
09:39:29,890 --> 09:39:31,130
Oh yeah, sure.

10828
09:39:32,830 --> 09:39:34,290
I don't think we need it yet.

10829
09:39:36,150 --> 09:39:36,910
Help me, help me, help me.

10830
09:39:38,970 --> 09:39:39,770
I'm gonna use it.

10831
09:39:41,330 --> 09:39:41,770
Woah!

10832
09:39:45,430 --> 09:39:45,890
Come on!

10833
09:39:49,390 --> 09:39:51,950
Well, three, two, one.

10834
09:39:52,210 --> 09:39:52,650
Wolverine!

10835
09:39:52,650 --> 09:39:52,910
Oh.

10836
09:39:54,730 --> 09:39:55,890
Oh, please!

10837
09:39:56,270 --> 09:39:56,970
Where is it?

10838
09:39:57,570 --> 09:39:58,530
Where did the medicine?

10839
09:40:02,370 --> 09:40:03,850
What happened to the medicine?

10840
09:40:08,370 --> 09:40:10,450
We could have lived!

10841
09:40:13,710 --> 09:40:14,610
It's fine.

10842
09:40:16,110 --> 09:40:16,670
It's fine.

10843
09:40:17,590 --> 09:40:21,030
I wanted to get against anyway.

10844
09:40:24,490 --> 09:40:25,390
It's fine.

10845
09:40:25,850 --> 09:40:26,470
It's fine.

10846
09:40:26,570 --> 09:40:27,170
That's fine.

10847
09:40:28,790 --> 09:40:32,430
It makes the things, it makes the journey much more rewarding, you know?

10848
09:40:33,330 --> 09:40:33,950
Oh!

10849
09:40:39,990 --> 09:40:41,970
Oh my god!

10850
09:40:42,330 --> 09:40:45,850
I just saw a man die in front of me.

10851
09:40:45,850 --> 09:40:46,410
Dude.

10852
09:40:48,070 --> 09:40:49,630
I saw him die.

10853
09:40:49,830 --> 09:40:50,690
It was crazy.

10854
09:40:52,850 --> 09:40:54,850
Oh my god.

10855
09:40:55,090 --> 09:40:56,790
Truly fucking wild.

10856
09:40:57,450 --> 09:40:59,110
What I had to watch there.

10857
09:41:05,420 --> 09:41:07,290
Oh my god.

10858
09:41:11,500 --> 09:41:12,350
Where is he?

10859
09:41:12,350 --> 09:41:14,150
Where is he?

10860
09:41:16,330 --> 09:41:17,910
Here, here, here.

10861
09:41:22,970 --> 09:41:25,650
There's a wolverine nearby.

10862
09:41:27,710 --> 09:41:28,870
I'm ulting this.

10863
09:41:30,370 --> 09:41:32,910
Oh my god.

10864
09:41:34,150 --> 09:41:39,530
The wolverine is behind us.

10865
09:41:42,350 --> 09:41:42,370
Okay.

10866
09:41:45,490 --> 09:41:47,450
The wolverine is like in our spot.

10867
09:41:47,870 --> 09:41:48,790
I'm going for him.

10868
09:41:55,510 --> 09:41:56,370
He's low, he's low!

10869
09:42:01,400 --> 09:42:01,840
Whoa!

10870
09:42:04,680 --> 09:42:05,060
Yeah!

10871
09:42:10,560 --> 09:42:12,180
Max one, or not one half.

10872
09:42:15,300 --> 09:42:16,260
Alright then.

10873
09:42:16,440 --> 09:42:17,840
I'm a little scared about that.

10874
09:42:22,480 --> 09:42:23,840
I'm on the point!

10875
09:42:24,820 --> 09:42:25,280
I got pulled.

10876
09:42:27,880 --> 09:42:28,480
Wolverine left.

10877
09:42:34,420 --> 09:42:35,620
He has again!

10878
09:42:38,980 --> 09:42:39,460
Yeah!

10879
09:42:40,180 --> 09:42:41,400
Oh, we did not need that.

10880
09:42:41,400 --> 09:42:41,900
Okay.

10881
09:42:42,560 --> 09:42:43,080
Whoa!

10882
09:42:51,180 --> 09:42:53,480
That was a little overkill guys.

10883
09:42:55,540 --> 09:42:57,920
Bro, fuck that one guy in particular.

10884
09:42:58,520 --> 09:43:02,400
I don't know who he killed, but like fuck that guy!

10885
09:43:02,400 --> 09:43:08,080
Fuck that guy!

10886
09:43:10,940 --> 09:43:12,520
That guy did not...

10887
09:43:12,520 --> 09:43:13,060
You know what?

10888
09:43:13,160 --> 09:43:15,540
Yeah, we just hate that man in particular.

10889
09:43:16,240 --> 09:43:18,520
Get the trick done and end them.

10890
09:43:22,940 --> 09:43:24,320
Oh my god.

10891
09:43:24,440 --> 09:43:25,240
One more round.

10892
09:43:25,340 --> 09:43:28,220
I think we need to win one more game after this to secure...

10893
09:43:28,220 --> 09:43:28,820
I don't know.

10894
09:43:28,820 --> 09:43:29,680
I don't know.

10895
09:43:29,860 --> 09:43:32,580
I can't tell if the cutoff is...

10896
09:43:32,580 --> 09:43:34,580
If it's gonna be 250 or 270.

10897
09:43:34,960 --> 09:43:37,740
I feel like 270 is safe, but then it feels like I'm greedy.

10898
09:43:38,920 --> 09:43:40,860
I feel really greedy.

10899
09:43:46,520 --> 09:43:47,780
They're like, wow!

10900
09:43:47,940 --> 09:43:50,660
We got you all the way here.

10901
09:43:50,660 --> 09:43:50,980
Hey!

10902
09:43:55,860 --> 09:43:58,020
500 is true.

10903
09:43:58,440 --> 09:43:59,880
Might as well just aim for 500.

10904
09:44:01,000 --> 09:44:02,620
Might as well.

10905
09:44:03,660 --> 09:44:04,140
En route.

10906
09:44:07,140 --> 09:44:08,040
Oh fuck it, I'm slapping.

10907
09:44:18,770 --> 09:44:20,570
Oh my god!

10908
09:44:26,570 --> 09:44:27,010
Oh!

10909
09:44:27,730 --> 09:44:28,910
I just got my ult.

10910
09:44:28,950 --> 09:44:29,830
I'm not gonna use it.

10911
09:44:32,290 --> 09:44:33,430
Oh my god.

10912
09:44:33,930 --> 09:44:35,670
Oh my god, he's hiding in plain sight.

10913
09:44:36,390 --> 09:44:38,910
Guys, if you're stream sniping right now, he's over here.

10914
09:44:45,430 --> 09:44:45,870
Alright.

10915
09:44:56,090 --> 09:44:56,970
Why would...

10916
09:44:56,970 --> 09:44:58,990
Then we know they're stream sniping!

10917
09:45:00,670 --> 09:45:02,010
That's basically it.

10918
09:45:03,410 --> 09:45:05,250
Oh my god.

10919
09:45:05,650 --> 09:45:06,550
Sorry, I should've ulted that.

10920
09:45:06,710 --> 09:45:07,290
Not my bad.

10921
09:45:14,070 --> 09:45:14,950
Oh my god.

10922
09:45:15,090 --> 09:45:16,950
I just didn't think he would get deleted.

10923
09:45:18,450 --> 09:45:20,110
I was like, whoa!

10924
09:45:22,150 --> 09:45:23,430
Oh my god.

10925
09:45:23,530 --> 09:45:24,830
Oh my god.

10926
09:45:24,950 --> 09:45:26,750
Oh my...

10927
09:45:26,750 --> 09:45:28,530
Oh my god, okay.

10928
09:45:29,330 --> 09:45:29,730
Alright.

10929
09:45:31,770 --> 09:45:34,710
So I wanted to know if they were actually stream sniping me, you know?

10930
09:45:39,450 --> 09:45:40,730
I wanted to know.

10931
09:45:40,890 --> 09:45:44,330
If he died from that, then I know they have my stream on a second monitor.

10932
09:45:44,430 --> 09:45:45,170
It's just that easy.

10933
09:45:45,730 --> 09:45:47,610
It's like the most easiest way to figure it out.

10934
09:45:54,420 --> 09:45:55,780
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

10935
09:45:58,580 --> 09:46:00,120
Oh, I'm saving you.

10936
09:46:00,200 --> 09:46:01,100
I'm saving you.

10937
09:46:01,220 --> 09:46:02,640
You're so healthy!

10938
09:46:02,640 --> 09:46:05,040
You're so healthy!

10939
09:46:08,440 --> 09:46:10,040
I had it ready for it.

10940
09:46:16,100 --> 09:46:17,860
I'm not okay.

10941
09:46:22,760 --> 09:46:25,440
I'm not okay.

10942
09:46:29,620 --> 09:46:31,780
That did not feel okay there.

10943
09:46:35,160 --> 09:46:35,940
It's okay.

10944
09:46:36,140 --> 09:46:37,080
I'm okay now.

10945
09:46:50,500 --> 09:46:52,180
Jesus Christ.

10946
09:46:56,600 --> 09:46:58,280
Oh no!

10947
09:46:59,140 --> 09:47:00,360
Wait, their exchange is low too?

10948
09:47:02,540 --> 09:47:03,380
Here.

10949
09:47:04,640 --> 09:47:04,900
Here.

10950
09:47:05,180 --> 09:47:05,820
Here.

10951
09:47:06,460 --> 09:47:07,120
Here.

10952
09:47:07,500 --> 09:47:07,760
Here.

10953
09:47:08,280 --> 09:47:09,120
Here.

10954
09:47:12,160 --> 09:47:12,760
Here.

10955
09:47:16,240 --> 09:47:16,840
Here.

10956
09:47:19,860 --> 09:47:20,460
Here.

10957
09:47:20,460 --> 09:47:22,560
Oh my god, his mic spiked there.

10958
09:47:22,680 --> 09:47:23,620
That like...

10959
09:47:23,620 --> 09:47:25,560
That like woke me up.

10960
09:47:27,380 --> 09:47:29,280
That actually woke me up there.

10961
09:47:29,660 --> 09:47:30,620
That mic spike.

10962
09:47:32,500 --> 09:47:33,020
I am brute.

10963
09:47:34,040 --> 09:47:34,820
I am brute.

10964
09:47:39,980 --> 09:47:41,220
I am brute.

10965
09:47:48,400 --> 09:47:49,240
Oh!

10966
09:47:51,340 --> 09:47:52,180
Oh

10967
09:47:56,330 --> 09:47:58,290
my god, you're all okay.

10968
09:47:58,770 --> 09:48:00,410
You're all so healthy.

10969
09:48:01,050 --> 09:48:02,910
You're so fucking healthy.

10970
09:48:03,330 --> 09:48:06,890
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

10971
09:48:06,990 --> 09:48:07,510
I'm backing out now.

10972
09:48:11,090 --> 09:48:11,930
What?

10973
09:48:14,230 --> 09:48:15,070
The

10974
09:48:24,600 --> 09:48:25,020
fuck?

10975
09:48:25,020 --> 09:48:26,480
Wait, there's a...

10976
09:48:26,480 --> 09:48:27,300
Luna to your left.

10977
09:48:29,820 --> 09:48:30,860
Yay!

10978
09:48:38,900 --> 09:48:40,120
Holy shit.

10979
09:48:40,640 --> 09:48:41,860
Oh my god.

10980
09:48:42,300 --> 09:48:44,280
GG so fun.

10981
09:48:44,420 --> 09:48:45,620
Had a blast.

10982
09:48:46,780 --> 09:48:48,320
I'm sorry.

10983
09:48:49,360 --> 09:48:50,580
I'm so sorry.

10984
09:48:57,060 --> 09:48:58,260
I like the squid game!

10985
09:48:58,600 --> 09:49:00,120
I actually don't know if this was...

10986
09:49:00,120 --> 09:49:01,480
Thank god I have UFO.

10987
09:49:01,720 --> 09:49:02,980
What am I...

10988
09:49:06,210 --> 09:49:08,270
Oh shit, we're doing another one more.

10989
09:49:08,510 --> 09:49:10,850
Oh my god, we're doing one more.

10990
09:49:10,970 --> 09:49:11,950
Okay, let's...

10991
09:49:11,950 --> 09:49:13,690
I feel a little...

10992
09:49:13,690 --> 09:49:16,690
I feel a little fucking feisty here.

10993
09:49:16,790 --> 09:49:17,390
Let's go.

10994
09:49:19,270 --> 09:49:20,030
Where am I?

10995
09:49:21,770 --> 09:49:22,290
224.

10996
09:49:22,450 --> 09:49:23,570
Okay, but this is the cutoff.

10997
09:49:24,130 --> 09:49:24,650
203.

10998
09:49:24,870 --> 09:49:25,110
Okay.

10999
09:49:25,770 --> 09:49:26,230
Alright.

11000
09:49:26,870 --> 09:49:28,570
Now back to the real game.

11001
09:49:28,770 --> 09:49:30,230
That means I still have a chance.

11002
09:49:30,850 --> 09:49:33,250
Guys, I still have a chance to win a squid game.

11003
09:49:33,630 --> 09:49:36,170
Guys, I still have another chance.

11004
09:49:37,930 --> 09:49:39,670
One more game and we're secured.

11005
09:49:40,230 --> 09:49:41,030
And then we're gonna...

11006
09:49:41,030 --> 09:49:42,990
Oh my god, I hope we don't lose that one game.

11007
09:49:43,550 --> 09:49:48,070
I hope we don't fly too close to the sun, guys.

11008
09:49:48,510 --> 09:49:51,770
I hope we don't fly too close to the sun.

11009
09:49:51,770 --> 09:49:51,870
I hope we don't fly too close to the sun.

11010
09:49:53,150 --> 09:49:54,430
Okay, here we go.

11011
09:49:55,310 --> 09:49:56,270
This is it.

11012
09:49:56,950 --> 09:49:57,570
This is it.

11013
09:49:58,870 --> 09:50:01,510
I don't think they want to come back tomorrow, so we're gonna...

11014
09:50:01,510 --> 09:50:03,330
They're gonna try and get this all done today.

11015
09:50:05,510 --> 09:50:07,030
Don't worry, don't worry.

11016
09:50:07,290 --> 09:50:08,650
No, it's not gonna jinx.

11017
09:50:08,690 --> 09:50:09,910
It only happens to the children.

11018
09:50:10,690 --> 09:50:12,710
It only happens to the children.

11019
09:50:12,970 --> 09:50:13,590
That's fine.

11020
09:50:14,110 --> 09:50:15,730
The jinxes only happens to them.

11021
09:50:16,750 --> 09:50:18,690
Be careful, Icarus.

11022
09:50:18,690 --> 09:50:20,710
Be careful, fly.

11023
09:50:20,930 --> 09:50:23,770
Fly right up to that stupid sun.

11024
09:50:24,730 --> 09:50:25,830
It's okay, this is it.

11025
09:50:27,370 --> 09:50:29,210
The real game is here.

11026
09:50:32,660 --> 09:50:34,540
Honestly, I think it is.

11027
09:50:34,760 --> 09:50:35,920
Ever since...

11028
09:50:35,920 --> 09:50:39,720
Ever since we started playing squid game, we've been winning.

11029
09:50:40,900 --> 09:50:42,840
That's actually crazy.

11030
09:50:43,620 --> 09:50:44,740
That's crazy.

11031
09:50:44,880 --> 09:50:48,620
We've actually started winning because we've been playing squid game on the side.

11032
09:50:48,620 --> 09:50:51,460
I don't even know if I'm locked in anymore.

11033
09:50:51,660 --> 09:50:56,800
I let out all my jinxes in squid.

11034
09:50:56,860 --> 09:51:01,420
I basically gave my jinxes and bad luck to the children.

11035
09:51:02,320 --> 09:51:03,880
And then we win.

11036
09:51:08,380 --> 09:51:10,900
Yeah, the 12 year olds are getting it.

11037
09:51:11,020 --> 09:51:12,020
Instead of me.

11038
09:51:13,200 --> 09:51:13,960
Thank God.

11039
09:51:14,100 --> 09:51:16,020
Thank God for the 12 year olds.

11040
09:51:16,020 --> 09:51:16,780
Thank God for the 12 year olds.

11041
09:51:19,560 --> 09:51:21,310
The cries of the kids.

11042
09:51:21,950 --> 09:51:23,450
Get me...

11043
09:51:23,450 --> 09:51:25,830
Get my adrenaline going.

11044
09:51:26,810 --> 09:51:28,990
What the fuck?

11045
09:51:31,850 --> 09:51:32,670
Exactly.

11046
09:51:32,850 --> 09:51:34,470
Losing squid game, winning rivals.

11047
09:51:48,350 --> 09:51:49,930
Boom, boom, boom.

11048
09:51:50,590 --> 09:51:51,690
How do I skip cutscene?

11049
09:51:54,010 --> 09:51:54,750
Oh, there you go.

11050
09:51:54,750 --> 09:51:55,370
I skipped it.

11051
09:51:55,630 --> 09:51:57,110
Maybe it's spacebar.

11052
09:51:57,350 --> 09:51:58,530
I'm gonna try and push the children.

11053
09:52:00,690 --> 09:52:01,410
Yeah, I know.

11054
09:52:01,550 --> 09:52:03,770
I've seen them use the soundboard for like every...

11055
09:52:03,770 --> 09:52:05,350
Every other...

11056
09:52:05,350 --> 09:52:07,350
Every squid game equivalent.

11057
09:52:07,690 --> 09:52:13,570
So like Call of Duty, Fortnite, Roblox, but I don't have voice chat because I didn't dox myself on Roblox.

11058
09:52:17,030 --> 09:52:17,790
How do I...

11059
09:52:19,250 --> 09:52:20,290
It's not...

11060
09:52:20,290 --> 09:52:21,230
It's not F.

11061
09:52:22,870 --> 09:52:23,810
I'm going in.

11062
09:52:23,910 --> 09:52:24,390
I'm going in.

11063
09:52:24,430 --> 09:52:24,790
Come on.

11064
09:52:24,890 --> 09:52:27,770
Oh, there's some new players here.

11065
09:52:31,050 --> 09:52:32,630
Oh, I'm so scared.

11066
09:52:33,190 --> 09:52:34,090
I'm so scared.

11067
09:52:35,750 --> 09:52:37,710
I'm trying to figure out how to push guys.

11068
09:52:41,750 --> 09:52:42,790
It's not E.

11069
09:52:43,350 --> 09:52:44,250
Is it enter?

11070
09:52:44,250 --> 09:52:44,370
Is it enter?

11071
09:52:45,110 --> 09:52:47,590
I need to make sure I don't jump accidentally.

11072
09:52:48,010 --> 09:52:48,490
I did.

11073
09:52:51,090 --> 09:52:53,430
I pressed 1 though.

11074
09:52:55,790 --> 09:52:57,050
I have equipped.

11075
09:52:59,830 --> 09:53:01,390
I do have it equipped.

11076
09:53:02,790 --> 09:53:04,550
Press 1, then left click.

11077
09:53:05,190 --> 09:53:06,650
Oh my god, that is it.

11078
09:53:07,090 --> 09:53:07,910
I used it.

11079
09:53:08,350 --> 09:53:10,530
I was running when I used it.

11080
09:53:10,530 --> 09:53:12,210
Oh my god, wait.

11081
09:53:13,950 --> 09:53:14,850
Make a wall.

11082
09:53:15,290 --> 09:53:17,130
Come on.

11083
09:53:17,210 --> 09:53:18,010
Come on, lady.

11084
09:53:18,810 --> 09:53:19,870
Come on, lady.

11085
09:53:20,250 --> 09:53:20,910
Come on.

11086
09:53:21,270 --> 09:53:22,750
Get over here, lady.

11087
09:53:22,890 --> 09:53:24,150
We're gonna push you.

11088
09:53:24,490 --> 09:53:24,770
Come on.

11089
09:53:27,230 --> 09:53:27,910
We're here.

11090
09:53:28,150 --> 09:53:29,410
We're making a wall.

11091
09:53:31,090 --> 09:53:32,330
I figured it out.

11092
09:53:32,430 --> 09:53:34,030
I figured out how to push.

11093
09:53:40,690 --> 09:53:42,230
I did it.

11094
09:53:42,670 --> 09:53:44,890
I fucking did it.

11095
09:53:45,510 --> 09:53:46,630
That's right.

11096
09:53:47,750 --> 09:53:49,590
That's fucked up.

11097
09:53:49,950 --> 09:53:51,590
Make a wall, children.

11098
09:53:52,530 --> 09:53:54,610
Make a fucking wall.

11099
09:53:56,530 --> 09:53:57,230
You can't.

11100
09:53:57,230 --> 09:53:59,650
You can't save the push in glass game.

11101
09:53:59,750 --> 09:54:00,250
I tried.

11102
09:54:00,690 --> 09:54:03,890
All you get is a fucking honeycomb to eat in front of people.

11103
09:54:07,210 --> 09:54:08,750
That's all I could do.

11104
09:54:08,750 --> 09:54:10,950
All I could do was just eat my honeycomb.

11105
09:54:11,410 --> 09:54:13,070
Also, Sean, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

11106
09:54:13,170 --> 09:54:14,030
Thank you, thank you.

11107
09:54:14,170 --> 09:54:15,550
I appreciate it.

11108
09:54:16,450 --> 09:54:16,970
Alright.

11109
09:54:19,170 --> 09:54:20,350
Yay, a circle.

11110
09:54:22,450 --> 09:54:22,970
Yeah.

11111
09:54:28,000 --> 09:54:29,540
96 versus 79.

11112
09:54:29,940 --> 09:54:32,680
Do you know these are children names right there?

11113
09:54:32,820 --> 09:54:33,640
The little crap.

11114
09:54:33,940 --> 09:54:34,440
31.

11115
09:54:44,840 --> 09:54:49,320
I just played an insane Marble Rivals game.

11116
09:54:49,620 --> 09:54:51,720
I can survive a circle.

11117
09:54:59,010 --> 09:54:59,510
My...

11118
09:55:02,990 --> 09:55:04,550
Every time.

11119
09:55:05,610 --> 09:55:07,430
Our team lived.

11120
09:55:07,530 --> 09:55:08,290
Let's go.

11121
09:55:10,890 --> 09:55:12,850
Guys, our team lived.

11122
09:55:12,990 --> 09:55:14,030
Let's fucking go.

11123
09:55:14,030 --> 09:55:14,110
Let's go.

11124
09:55:17,770 --> 09:55:18,250
Exactly.

11125
09:55:19,950 --> 09:55:21,170
Oh my god.

11126
09:55:21,270 --> 09:55:24,890
Every time that gunshot fucking freaks me out.

11127
09:55:25,750 --> 09:55:26,930
We did it, guys.

11128
09:55:27,190 --> 09:55:27,610
We did it.

11129
09:55:27,630 --> 09:55:28,250
We lived.

11130
09:55:29,030 --> 09:55:30,350
Guys, we're survivors.

11131
09:55:30,870 --> 09:55:32,730
Yeah, see, I can eat my honeycomb right here.

11132
09:55:33,910 --> 09:55:34,810
I did it.

11133
09:55:34,970 --> 09:55:35,790
I just ate it.

11134
09:55:37,050 --> 09:55:38,770
That was the munch sound.

11135
09:55:40,110 --> 09:55:41,410
I survived again.

11136
09:55:41,510 --> 09:55:42,010
I survived another day.

11137
09:55:42,570 --> 09:55:44,010
We're back to figuring out.

11138
09:55:44,550 --> 09:55:47,150
If I'm gonna get a secure top 500.

11139
09:55:47,650 --> 09:55:48,750
Or win.

11140
09:55:49,650 --> 09:55:51,190
Or win a squid game.

11141
09:55:51,330 --> 09:55:52,030
Which is first.

11142
09:55:52,130 --> 09:55:52,790
There's still hope.

11143
09:55:54,390 --> 09:55:55,590
We can't gamble.

11144
09:55:55,690 --> 09:55:56,950
Because we already gambled already.

11145
09:55:57,750 --> 09:55:59,350
We can't gamble anymore.

11146
09:55:59,490 --> 09:56:01,290
We have to wait until the end result.

11147
09:56:01,550 --> 09:56:02,530
To finish our gambling.

11148
09:56:03,950 --> 09:56:05,770
Another day, another munch.

11149
09:56:05,770 --> 09:56:07,130
Munch.

11150
09:56:10,570 --> 09:56:10,750
Oh.

11151
09:56:11,450 --> 09:56:12,790
Another intermission?

11152
09:56:13,070 --> 09:56:15,090
I don't understand the extra intermission.

11153
09:56:15,230 --> 09:56:16,870
Oh, they add more money.

11154
09:56:18,970 --> 09:56:21,430
That's what the intermission is.

11155
09:56:23,870 --> 09:56:25,330
Did he die?

11156
09:56:26,330 --> 09:56:26,790
Oh!

11157
09:56:26,950 --> 09:56:27,290
Oh!

11158
09:56:27,450 --> 09:56:30,570
I didn't realize he...

11159
09:56:40,070 --> 09:56:42,390
Oh my god.

11160
09:56:46,850 --> 09:56:47,870
Oh my god.

11161
09:56:47,930 --> 09:56:48,550
Oh my god.

11162
09:56:48,550 --> 09:56:49,530
A fucking pay to win.

11163
09:56:49,890 --> 09:56:50,490
That's what I...

11164
09:56:50,490 --> 09:56:54,030
Oh my god.

11165
09:56:54,110 --> 09:56:54,730
Oh my god.

11166
09:56:54,850 --> 09:56:56,770
That's what I...

11167
09:56:59,110 --> 09:57:00,390
I actually...

11168
09:57:00,390 --> 09:57:02,770
I actually almost got shanked again.

11169
09:57:03,170 --> 09:57:04,130
And so...

11170
09:57:04,130 --> 09:57:06,770
I almost died to a shank again.

11171
09:57:07,410 --> 09:57:08,970
Oh my god.

11172
09:57:10,190 --> 09:57:12,910
I couldn't let that be my legacy.

11173
09:57:12,910 --> 09:57:14,890
I couldn't let go.

11174
09:57:15,030 --> 09:57:15,770
I like this guy's...

11175
09:57:15,770 --> 09:57:17,170
I like this guy's costume.

11176
09:57:18,950 --> 09:57:22,390
And Toki came back on the fifth day.

11177
09:57:22,770 --> 09:57:25,410
Guys, I almost got shanked again.

11178
09:57:25,910 --> 09:57:27,830
Like, that's so fucked up.

11179
09:57:29,010 --> 09:57:30,050
Oh my god.

11180
09:57:30,890 --> 09:57:35,010
Responded to a fucking crew of shankers.

11181
09:57:39,390 --> 09:57:40,190
Friend?

11182
09:57:43,270 --> 09:57:44,210
Turn up.

11183
09:57:46,510 --> 09:57:47,790
Oh god.

11184
09:57:48,210 --> 09:57:48,590
Oh god.

11185
09:57:48,950 --> 09:57:49,130
Wait.

11186
09:57:49,490 --> 09:57:49,650
Wait.

11187
09:57:50,050 --> 09:57:50,250
Wait.

11188
09:57:50,630 --> 09:57:51,030
Yes!

11189
09:57:51,270 --> 09:57:51,910
Oh my god!

11190
09:57:51,950 --> 09:57:52,870
I got the cat man!

11191
09:57:53,470 --> 09:57:54,330
Cat man!

11192
09:57:55,030 --> 09:57:56,490
Let's go, cat man!

11193
09:57:56,970 --> 09:57:58,550
Let's watch the people die.

11194
09:57:59,490 --> 09:58:00,790
Oh, are they gonna make it?

11195
09:58:03,030 --> 09:58:03,670
Oh.

11196
09:58:05,390 --> 09:58:06,030
Oh.

11197
09:58:08,750 --> 09:58:09,390
Oh.

11198
09:58:09,990 --> 09:58:10,270
Wait.

11199
09:58:10,270 --> 09:58:11,850
Wait, she's still alive.

11200
09:58:11,970 --> 09:58:12,330
Oh.

11201
09:58:18,750 --> 09:58:20,890
Oh, there's her cold, dead body.

11202
09:58:22,590 --> 09:58:23,150
Children!

11203
09:58:23,550 --> 09:58:25,390
Get away from that body!

11204
09:58:35,790 --> 09:58:37,030
Get in here.

11205
09:58:37,190 --> 09:58:37,530
Get in here.

11206
09:58:37,650 --> 09:58:37,850
Friend.

11207
09:58:37,990 --> 09:58:38,190
Friend.

11208
09:58:38,190 --> 09:58:38,870
Get in here.

11209
09:58:39,090 --> 09:58:39,350
Friend.

11210
09:58:39,690 --> 09:58:40,050
Friends!

11211
09:58:40,270 --> 09:58:40,610
Friends!

11212
09:58:40,810 --> 09:58:41,310
Get in here!

11213
09:58:41,590 --> 09:58:41,870
Friends!

11214
09:58:42,190 --> 09:58:42,650
Please!

11215
09:58:42,970 --> 09:58:43,510
Please!

11216
09:58:43,750 --> 09:58:44,330
Glasses man!

11217
09:58:47,880 --> 09:58:48,880
Oh my god.

11218
09:58:49,680 --> 09:58:50,880
We did it.

11219
09:58:52,380 --> 09:58:54,920
Glasses man, I knew you'd be my friend.

11220
09:58:55,340 --> 09:58:57,300
I knew you'd be my friend.

11221
09:58:58,480 --> 09:58:58,940
Yay!

11222
09:59:01,180 --> 09:59:02,700
Oh, everybody lived.

11223
09:59:04,160 --> 09:59:04,540
Yeah.

11224
09:59:05,980 --> 09:59:06,660
Yeah.

11225
09:59:07,700 --> 09:59:08,380
Yeah.

11226
09:59:13,100 --> 09:59:13,700
Yeah.

11227
09:59:15,240 --> 09:59:15,840
Yeah.

11228
09:59:21,810 --> 09:59:22,410
No.

11229
09:59:23,550 --> 09:59:23,550
No.

11230
09:59:24,070 --> 09:59:24,670
No.

11231
09:59:25,250 --> 09:59:25,570
No.

11232
09:59:26,050 --> 09:59:26,310
No.

11233
09:59:26,310 --> 09:59:26,590
No!

11234
09:59:27,350 --> 09:59:29,990
Please, somebody come live with me!

11235
09:59:30,290 --> 09:59:30,490
Please.

11236
09:59:30,690 --> 09:59:31,450
Oh my god, Gumball.

11237
09:59:31,590 --> 09:59:32,350
Oh my god.

11238
09:59:32,610 --> 09:59:34,010
Oh my god, we lived.

11239
09:59:34,150 --> 09:59:35,650
Gumball, you and I.

11240
09:59:36,590 --> 09:59:37,790
You and I.

11241
09:59:39,070 --> 09:59:40,190
We lived.

11242
09:59:42,450 --> 09:59:43,650
We lived.

11243
09:59:43,650 --> 09:59:45,650
Oh my god.

11244
09:59:47,030 --> 09:59:49,390
I knew we got this together, friend.

11245
09:59:50,150 --> 09:59:51,390
You and I, Gumball.

11246
09:59:52,230 --> 09:59:53,150
010912.

11247
09:59:53,590 --> 09:59:53,910
Oh.

11248
09:59:55,830 --> 09:59:56,530
Gumball?

11249
09:59:58,190 --> 09:59:59,110
Hello?

11250
10:00:00,410 --> 10:00:01,070
Hello?

11251
10:00:03,850 --> 10:00:04,710
Hello?

11252
10:00:08,490 --> 10:00:09,410
Hello?

11253
10:00:09,410 --> 10:00:09,570
Hello?

11254
10:00:12,050 --> 10:00:12,690
Guys.

11255
10:00:12,990 --> 10:00:14,270
Guys, I'm still here!

11256
10:00:14,590 --> 10:00:15,230
Guys!

11257
10:00:17,110 --> 10:00:18,630
Let me out!

11258
10:00:19,950 --> 10:00:21,130
Guys, please!

11259
10:00:21,270 --> 10:00:22,390
I'm still in this game!

11260
10:00:23,570 --> 10:00:25,510
Gumball was never real.

11261
10:00:25,890 --> 10:00:27,970
Hey guys, I sorta got locked in.

11262
10:00:28,530 --> 10:00:30,510
I got locked in, but I'm okay now.

11263
10:00:31,190 --> 10:00:31,890
I'm okay.

11264
10:00:32,930 --> 10:00:34,730
Okay, I got locked in.

11265
10:00:34,730 --> 10:00:35,490
It was a little freaky.

11266
10:00:39,400 --> 10:00:40,760
What the fuck?

11267
10:00:40,840 --> 10:00:42,100
You can do that?

11268
10:00:42,520 --> 10:00:44,660
But I got baited the jump.

11269
10:00:47,970 --> 10:00:49,210
I hate this music.

11270
10:00:49,210 --> 10:00:50,630
This music is so ominous.

11271
10:00:50,710 --> 10:00:51,690
Oh, goodbye, sir.

11272
10:00:52,030 --> 10:00:53,710
That's why you become sheep.

11273
10:00:54,850 --> 10:00:55,810
That's why you are.

11274
10:00:55,930 --> 10:00:57,530
We gotta be sheep, guys.

11275
10:00:58,470 --> 10:01:01,170
There's no point in trying to be a leader.

11276
10:01:03,470 --> 10:01:04,750
There's no point.

11277
10:01:04,750 --> 10:01:09,690
Come on, take the jump.

11278
10:01:12,150 --> 10:01:14,530
Wait, how do I type in the Roblox chat?

11279
10:01:15,590 --> 10:01:25,670
My dad works for this game, and it's usually and it's usually the right side.

11280
10:01:35,590 --> 10:01:36,790
See, it worked.

11281
10:01:37,190 --> 10:01:38,730
Now they'll think I'm right.

11282
10:01:39,310 --> 10:01:40,670
See, look at that.

11283
10:01:41,950 --> 10:01:43,530
Oh my god, it's working.

11284
10:01:45,090 --> 10:01:46,090
No way.

11285
10:01:46,650 --> 10:01:49,570
Oh my god, now they'll think it's always right.

11286
10:01:50,570 --> 10:01:52,050
That's crazy, bro.

11287
10:01:52,690 --> 10:01:54,930
Oh my god, it's actually working.

11288
10:01:57,350 --> 10:01:59,690
See, I said it's usually right.

11289
10:02:00,590 --> 10:02:03,990
I gaslight them into thinking, oh my god, wait a minute.

11290
10:02:04,490 --> 10:02:06,190
Wait, am I fucking psychic?

11291
10:02:06,550 --> 10:02:07,770
Wait a minute.

11292
10:02:09,330 --> 10:02:12,210
Wait a minute, what the fuck?

11293
10:02:12,670 --> 10:02:13,450
What is it?

11294
10:02:13,730 --> 10:02:13,790
What?

11295
10:02:16,790 --> 10:02:17,930
No way.

11296
10:02:19,990 --> 10:02:20,950
No way.

11297
10:02:20,950 --> 10:02:20,990
No way.

11298
10:02:24,670 --> 10:02:26,950
Oh my god, no fucking way.

11299
10:02:27,150 --> 10:02:28,810
Wait, no fucking way.

11300
10:02:29,090 --> 10:02:29,870
That's crazy.

11301
10:02:32,710 --> 10:02:34,230
I told you.

11302
10:02:38,810 --> 10:02:39,530
Okay.

11303
10:02:43,170 --> 10:02:44,450
Oh my god.

11304
10:02:45,130 --> 10:02:46,390
I was actually right.

11305
10:02:47,290 --> 10:02:49,710
I told you guys, it's usually right.

11306
10:02:50,430 --> 10:02:52,050
I've played these games before.

11307
10:02:53,390 --> 10:02:56,370
Oh my god, I've never got this far before, guys.

11308
10:02:56,870 --> 10:02:58,470
I've never got this far before.

11309
10:02:59,210 --> 10:03:00,110
This is crazy.

11310
10:03:01,530 --> 10:03:06,130
I literally had like wall hacks on and could see where the gas was.

11311
10:03:06,910 --> 10:03:07,730
Okay, what's this?

11312
10:03:12,970 --> 10:03:13,610
Wait.

11313
10:03:14,290 --> 10:03:15,310
Wait, what?

11314
10:03:18,810 --> 10:03:19,330
What?

11315
10:03:19,330 --> 10:03:19,630
Wait, what?

11316
10:03:24,140 --> 10:03:24,660
Oh.

11317
10:03:26,080 --> 10:03:27,640
Wait, why are they...

11318
10:03:27,640 --> 10:03:29,180
Why is he walking to me?

11319
10:03:29,860 --> 10:03:30,640
Come on, that's right.

11320
10:03:30,760 --> 10:03:31,360
Give it up.

11321
10:03:31,660 --> 10:03:32,480
That's fucking right.

11322
10:03:32,580 --> 10:03:33,360
Get over here.

11323
10:03:35,460 --> 10:03:36,480
Oh, they're starting.

11324
10:03:36,760 --> 10:03:38,020
They're starting the brawl.

11325
10:03:40,620 --> 10:03:41,520
That's fucking right.

11326
10:03:41,520 --> 10:03:42,200
I'm running now.

11327
10:03:42,980 --> 10:03:43,500
Whoa.

11328
10:03:43,500 --> 10:03:43,860
Whoa.

11329
10:03:45,820 --> 10:03:46,620
That's fucking right.

11330
10:03:47,040 --> 10:03:47,520
Whoa.

11331
10:03:48,300 --> 10:03:48,780
Whoa.

11332
10:03:51,620 --> 10:03:52,380
I'm not.

11333
10:03:52,580 --> 10:03:53,380
That's fucking right.

11334
10:03:53,500 --> 10:03:53,760
Whoa.

11335
10:03:55,540 --> 10:03:56,640
I just gotta get away.

11336
10:03:57,840 --> 10:03:59,000
I just gotta get away.

11337
10:03:59,040 --> 10:03:59,580
He's crazy.

11338
10:03:59,820 --> 10:04:00,980
Pink man is crazy.

11339
10:04:01,540 --> 10:04:02,540
Pink guy is crazy.

11340
10:04:02,680 --> 10:04:03,780
He has nothing to lose.

11341
10:04:04,360 --> 10:04:05,980
Pink man has nothing to lose.

11342
10:04:06,120 --> 10:04:07,380
Why are you targeting me?

11343
10:04:09,300 --> 10:04:10,140
Oh my god.

11344
10:04:10,140 --> 10:04:11,320
Oh my god.

11345
10:04:11,620 --> 10:04:13,360
Pink guy is crazy.

11346
10:04:14,720 --> 10:04:15,240
Wait.

11347
10:04:15,460 --> 10:04:15,640
Wait.

11348
10:04:15,820 --> 10:04:16,040
No.

11349
10:04:16,280 --> 10:04:16,520
No.

11350
10:04:16,760 --> 10:04:17,060
No.

11351
10:04:17,320 --> 10:04:17,800
I fell.

11352
10:04:17,880 --> 10:04:18,660
My god.

11353
10:04:21,250 --> 10:04:21,990
I got hit.

11354
10:04:22,490 --> 10:04:23,350
I got hit there.

11355
10:04:24,330 --> 10:04:25,030
Iron fist time.

11356
10:04:25,130 --> 10:04:25,410
You're right.

11357
10:04:25,510 --> 10:04:26,470
It's iron fist time.

11358
10:04:26,690 --> 10:04:28,590
We're playing iron fist.

11359
10:04:28,850 --> 10:04:30,450
I got tapped out.

11360
10:04:31,770 --> 10:04:32,630
There's nothing to lose.

11361
10:04:32,990 --> 10:04:34,090
And everything to gain.

11362
10:04:34,530 --> 10:04:36,270
He really has nothing to lose here.

11363
10:04:36,390 --> 10:04:38,710
He's just gonna throw fucking hands.

11364
10:04:39,890 --> 10:04:40,550
Oh my god.

11365
10:04:40,550 --> 10:04:41,470
I don't know who's low.

11366
10:04:42,570 --> 10:04:43,150
I'm gonna go.

11367
10:04:43,290 --> 10:04:43,930
I'm sneaking in.

11368
10:04:44,190 --> 10:04:44,470
I'm sneaking.

11369
10:04:44,610 --> 10:04:45,270
Oh, I got hit.

11370
10:04:45,410 --> 10:04:46,410
I got hit.

11371
10:04:46,490 --> 10:04:47,510
There we go.

11372
10:04:48,250 --> 10:04:49,870
I have nothing to lose too.

11373
10:04:50,110 --> 10:04:50,550
Get over here.

11374
10:04:50,630 --> 10:04:51,170
Oh no.

11375
10:04:51,270 --> 10:04:51,530
Not me.

11376
10:04:51,630 --> 10:04:51,910
Not me.

11377
10:04:51,970 --> 10:04:52,670
Not me.

11378
10:04:52,870 --> 10:04:53,470
Not me.

11379
10:04:53,970 --> 10:04:54,930
I just gotta live.

11380
10:04:55,090 --> 10:04:56,790
I just gotta live 19 more seconds.

11381
10:04:57,510 --> 10:04:57,910
No.

11382
10:04:58,170 --> 10:04:58,330
No.

11383
10:04:58,550 --> 10:04:59,170
I just gotta live.

11384
10:04:59,390 --> 10:05:01,110
Bro, he's just locked in.

11385
10:05:01,510 --> 10:05:04,010
His fist is magnetized to me.

11386
10:05:04,770 --> 10:05:05,570
Holy shit.

11387
10:05:05,930 --> 10:05:06,930
He's actually...

11388
10:05:06,930 --> 10:05:07,450
Oh my god.

11389
10:05:07,490 --> 10:05:09,010
Get away from me.

11390
10:05:10,690 --> 10:05:11,830
Two seconds.

11391
10:05:12,250 --> 10:05:12,610
Two.

11392
10:05:12,930 --> 10:05:13,370
One.

11393
10:05:13,550 --> 10:05:13,830
I lived.

11394
10:05:14,030 --> 10:05:14,430
I lived.

11395
10:05:14,690 --> 10:05:15,090
I lived.

11396
10:05:15,430 --> 10:05:15,750
I lived.

11397
10:05:27,110 --> 10:05:30,070
I can't fucking stop me.

11398
10:05:31,950 --> 10:05:34,010
I can't stop me.

11399
10:05:34,210 --> 10:05:35,810
They all targeted me.

11400
10:05:36,830 --> 10:05:38,870
They all fucking targeted me.

11401
10:05:38,990 --> 10:05:40,070
Oh my god.

11402
10:05:40,190 --> 10:05:40,810
Oh my god.

11403
10:05:40,830 --> 10:05:41,470
There's Gojo.

11404
10:05:42,210 --> 10:05:43,070
There's Gojo.

11405
10:05:44,450 --> 10:05:45,630
I didn't know we had...

11406
10:05:45,630 --> 10:05:46,990
There was no instructions.

11407
10:05:47,810 --> 10:05:49,430
There was no instructions.

11408
10:05:49,750 --> 10:05:50,730
It was just...

11409
10:05:50,730 --> 10:05:53,010
It was just start punching.

11410
10:05:53,190 --> 10:05:54,610
How was I supposed to know?

11411
10:05:54,890 --> 10:05:58,130
All they told me to do was start punching.

11412
10:05:58,710 --> 10:06:02,070
How was I supposed to know there was more?

11413
10:06:02,910 --> 10:06:07,850
That was literally my only instruction.

11414
10:06:09,550 --> 10:06:12,290
How was I supposed to know?

11415
10:06:15,350 --> 10:06:18,050
Survival of the fittest.

11416
10:06:18,810 --> 10:06:20,150
Oh my god.

11417
10:06:21,370 --> 10:06:23,490
That was more intense than Marvel Rivals.

11418
10:06:24,110 --> 10:06:25,490
They all just started punching.

11419
10:06:27,470 --> 10:06:27,950
Okay.

11420
10:06:29,430 --> 10:06:32,710
Oh, when the time runs out and no one dies, that's good.

11421
10:06:32,810 --> 10:06:33,850
All the... I'm glad.

11422
10:06:33,970 --> 10:06:34,970
I'm glad they all died.

11423
10:06:35,170 --> 10:06:35,890
I'm so happy.

11424
10:06:36,670 --> 10:06:38,150
I'm so fucking happy.

11425
10:06:40,290 --> 10:06:41,370
Alright, I'm still in queue.

11426
10:06:41,450 --> 10:06:41,870
I checked.

11427
10:06:42,350 --> 10:06:44,550
Okay, now I know that's like shank hours.

11428
10:06:44,950 --> 10:06:45,810
Like when...

11429
10:06:45,810 --> 10:06:49,430
It's like nobody was shanking when I was like just chilling in the bed.

11430
10:06:50,590 --> 10:06:53,050
This is like the first time I've had people start shanking.

11431
10:06:54,070 --> 10:06:56,050
That's why I'm gonna save my pay to win for that punching game.

11432
10:06:56,490 --> 10:06:58,230
I'm just gonna be like surprised I'm here.

11433
10:06:59,290 --> 10:07:03,990
I'm gonna go punching and I'll punch as many kids as I can in Roblox.

11434
10:07:03,990 --> 10:07:04,930
In Roblox, everybody.

11435
10:07:05,330 --> 10:07:08,210
And then like after that...

11436
10:07:08,210 --> 10:07:14,830
After that, I'm just gonna revive myself and then I'll...

11437
10:07:14,830 --> 10:07:17,510
And then...

11438
10:07:17,510 --> 10:07:19,070
And then I'll win.

11439
10:07:19,410 --> 10:07:20,630
I got the strat now.

11440
10:07:21,830 --> 10:07:23,570
What a save.

11441
10:07:24,930 --> 10:07:28,010
Quick disclaimer by the way, in Roblox.

11442
10:07:29,090 --> 10:07:31,650
I'm just gonna... I'm gonna punch the children in Roblox.

11443
10:07:31,650 --> 10:07:32,410
Like this.

11444
10:07:32,510 --> 10:07:33,090
I'll show you guys.

11445
10:07:33,190 --> 10:07:33,750
I'll show you.

11446
10:07:36,630 --> 10:07:39,070
I'll show you guys how I'm gonna do it.

11447
10:07:39,450 --> 10:07:40,310
Watch this.

11448
10:07:41,730 --> 10:07:42,690
Watch this.

11449
10:07:46,590 --> 10:07:47,550
Oh shit.

11450
10:07:49,530 --> 10:07:50,350
That's fucking right.

11451
10:07:50,490 --> 10:07:51,750
Get... get pushed.

11452
10:07:52,750 --> 10:07:53,270
Get pushed.

11453
10:07:53,390 --> 10:07:54,050
That's fucking right.

11454
10:07:54,130 --> 10:07:54,490
That's right.

11455
10:07:54,490 --> 10:07:55,270
Oh.

11456
10:08:02,310 --> 10:08:03,450
That's right.

11457
10:08:03,590 --> 10:08:04,470
Get... get punched.

11458
10:08:04,850 --> 10:08:05,590
That's fucking right.

11459
10:08:12,200 --> 10:08:12,960
Okay.

11460
10:08:13,440 --> 10:08:14,320
King Ray.

11461
10:08:14,960 --> 10:08:16,480
I'm coming for you.

11462
10:08:16,580 --> 10:08:18,180
I'm coming for you.

11463
10:08:18,200 --> 10:08:18,360
Oh.

11464
10:08:19,540 --> 10:08:20,660
Oh man.

11465
10:08:24,380 --> 10:08:26,980
That's fucking right.

11466
10:08:27,040 --> 10:08:27,220
I'm going.

11467
10:08:27,360 --> 10:08:28,040
I'm coming for this girl.

11468
10:08:28,460 --> 10:08:29,600
I'm going for the Tom.

11469
10:08:29,760 --> 10:08:30,420
Tom, whatever.

11470
10:08:30,660 --> 10:08:31,520
I'm coming for you.

11471
10:08:31,540 --> 10:08:32,140
I'm coming for you.

11472
10:08:32,160 --> 10:08:32,400
Come on.

11473
10:08:32,960 --> 10:08:33,360
Oh.

11474
10:08:34,620 --> 10:08:35,420
Push Gojo?

11475
10:08:35,660 --> 10:08:36,420
Did he make it?

11476
10:08:36,600 --> 10:08:38,740
Oh, he made it.

11477
10:08:44,390 --> 10:08:45,230
Make a wall.

11478
10:08:45,630 --> 10:08:46,470
Make a wall.

11479
10:08:46,470 --> 10:08:49,670
Oh no.

11480
10:08:52,250 --> 10:08:52,730
That's right.

11481
10:08:52,850 --> 10:08:53,430
Make a wall.

11482
10:08:53,590 --> 10:08:54,510
We're not letting you through.

11483
10:08:54,890 --> 10:08:55,270
Come on.

11484
10:08:56,090 --> 10:08:56,850
Come on.

11485
10:08:57,050 --> 10:08:57,710
Come on.

11486
10:08:57,790 --> 10:08:57,890
Come on.

11487
10:08:57,910 --> 10:09:00,310
Oh, you think we're gonna let you?

11488
10:09:00,550 --> 10:09:02,690
You think... you think we're gonna...

11489
10:09:02,690 --> 10:09:04,150
I think...

11490
10:09:04,150 --> 10:09:04,850
I'm out.

11491
10:09:06,330 --> 10:09:08,470
I tried to turn around and push somebody.

11492
10:09:09,250 --> 10:09:11,570
Oh, and I... I wanna do what they did to me.

11493
10:09:13,430 --> 10:09:14,390
I wanted...

11494
10:09:14,390 --> 10:09:16,410
I was trying to push somebody up.

11495
10:09:17,750 --> 10:09:18,750
This is it.

11496
10:09:19,150 --> 10:09:19,950
This is it.

11497
10:09:19,990 --> 10:09:20,450
This is it.

11498
10:09:20,610 --> 10:09:21,230
I believe.

11499
10:09:22,230 --> 10:09:23,970
I fucking believe.

11500
10:09:24,090 --> 10:09:24,790
Right here.

11501
10:09:24,930 --> 10:09:25,790
Right now.

11502
10:09:26,170 --> 10:09:27,010
This is it.

11503
10:09:27,110 --> 10:09:29,010
This is a game changer moment.

11504
10:09:30,030 --> 10:09:30,810
That's me.

11505
10:09:30,990 --> 10:09:32,010
I'm gonna be top.

11506
10:09:32,410 --> 10:09:32,610
Bang.

11507
10:09:32,730 --> 10:09:32,730
Bang.

11508
10:09:32,830 --> 10:09:33,210
Bang.

11509
10:09:33,510 --> 10:09:33,750
Boom.

11510
10:09:33,930 --> 10:09:34,190
Boom.

11511
10:09:34,370 --> 10:09:34,790
Boom.

11512
10:09:34,790 --> 10:09:35,250
Boom.

11513
10:09:35,550 --> 10:09:37,630
Are you broke?

11514
10:09:39,910 --> 10:09:43,410
I am so tempted to buy robux.

11515
10:09:43,410 --> 10:09:46,230
I'll just buy them or I'm broke.

11516
10:09:46,330 --> 10:09:48,230
Children are so cruel.

11517
10:09:50,270 --> 10:09:52,010
What the fuck?

11518
10:09:53,950 --> 10:09:54,170
What?

11519
10:09:54,990 --> 10:09:56,730
Oh, you guys don't see that?

11520
10:09:59,070 --> 10:10:00,610
Oh my god.

11521
10:10:00,690 --> 10:10:01,510
These kids.

11522
10:10:02,110 --> 10:10:05,530
These kids are shaming each other for not having robux.

11523
10:10:07,210 --> 10:10:09,310
He called a child a brokey.

11524
10:10:09,310 --> 10:10:09,490
Thank you.

11525
10:10:11,710 --> 10:10:13,530
Oh my god.

11526
10:10:14,510 --> 10:10:15,610
Poor child.

11527
10:10:20,730 --> 10:10:22,470
Alright, circle tab.

11528
10:10:22,550 --> 10:10:24,070
I'm getting better at this.

11529
10:10:26,650 --> 10:10:29,250
Those gunshots just don't faze me anymore.

11530
10:10:29,390 --> 10:10:30,550
It's like life now.

11531
10:10:31,650 --> 10:10:32,410
Yay!

11532
10:10:34,250 --> 10:10:36,970
It's like another child got shot.

11533
10:10:38,090 --> 10:10:38,930
In robux.

11534
10:10:41,270 --> 10:10:41,950
Yay!

11535
10:10:47,410 --> 10:10:48,090
Alright.

11536
10:10:50,350 --> 10:10:51,030
Yippee!

11537
10:10:51,130 --> 10:10:51,750
We did it!

11538
10:10:51,790 --> 10:10:53,610
We survived another hour!

11539
10:10:55,850 --> 10:10:58,410
I've become numb to the gunshots.

11540
10:10:58,830 --> 10:11:01,450
I got used to it.

11541
10:11:01,490 --> 10:11:02,810
I don't know if that's bad.

11542
10:11:02,890 --> 10:11:04,350
I think that's pretty bad.

11543
10:11:04,890 --> 10:11:06,890
I got used to it.

11544
10:11:08,910 --> 10:11:09,590
Alright.

11545
10:11:09,590 --> 10:11:11,130
Bum bum bum.

11546
10:11:11,470 --> 10:11:13,490
I should buy purple hair so I can be Thanos.

11547
10:11:15,370 --> 10:11:17,330
I actually haven't watched Squid Game 1 or 2.

11548
10:11:17,770 --> 10:11:24,050
I've just like seen the clips and I read, like, I've seen the clips and I read the summaries of it.

11549
10:11:24,110 --> 10:11:29,190
I feel like I'd be way too sad if I actually watched the full season.

11550
10:11:29,810 --> 10:11:32,550
Like, it sounds incredibly depressing.

11551
10:11:36,820 --> 10:11:37,900
Yeah, 2's already out.

11552
10:11:38,180 --> 10:11:39,720
That's where the mingle...

11553
10:11:39,720 --> 10:11:41,140
Hello, Gojo.

11554
10:11:42,380 --> 10:11:42,840
Hello.

11555
10:11:44,620 --> 10:11:46,400
I need my honeycomb in front of him.

11556
10:11:49,000 --> 10:11:50,100
Bang, bang, bang.

11557
10:11:50,340 --> 10:11:51,200
Boom, boom.

11558
10:11:51,360 --> 10:11:52,180
I love Big Bang.

11559
10:11:53,320 --> 10:11:54,500
What is it?

11560
10:11:54,800 --> 10:11:55,360
Big Bang?

11561
10:11:56,520 --> 10:11:57,160
Oh, nice.

11562
10:11:58,180 --> 10:11:59,960
I used to listen to their music a lot.

11563
10:12:00,240 --> 10:12:03,060
They were like BTS before BTS was a thing.

11564
10:12:04,100 --> 10:12:04,340
Hahaha!

11565
10:12:06,100 --> 10:12:06,580
Yeah!

11566
10:12:09,720 --> 10:12:10,320
Yeah!

11567
10:12:13,500 --> 10:12:14,480
Woo!

11568
10:12:15,400 --> 10:12:17,280
What the fuck?!

11569
10:12:18,820 --> 10:12:22,880
Just because I'd rather buy cheeseburger doesn't mean I'm fat.

11570
10:12:23,300 --> 10:12:24,240
Shut up!

11571
10:12:25,560 --> 10:12:30,090
My god, children.

11572
10:12:31,090 --> 10:12:32,280
Holy shit!

11573
10:12:32,710 --> 10:12:34,210
Kids are so mean!

11574
10:12:34,830 --> 10:12:35,930
Oh my god!

11575
10:12:36,850 --> 10:12:40,210
Why are kids so mean?!

11576
10:12:41,210 --> 10:12:43,610
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

11577
10:12:44,710 --> 10:12:46,370
Get over here!

11578
10:12:46,550 --> 10:12:47,050
Please!

11579
10:12:48,090 --> 10:12:48,890
Please!

11580
10:12:49,710 --> 10:12:50,070
Please!

11581
10:12:51,970 --> 10:12:53,850
There's 4 seconds left!

11582
10:12:54,050 --> 10:12:54,370
No!

11583
10:12:56,950 --> 10:12:58,250
Don't shoot me!

11584
10:12:58,590 --> 10:12:58,750
No!

11585
10:13:07,520 --> 10:13:08,880
I'm coming back.

11586
10:13:09,040 --> 10:13:10,100
I'm coming back.

11587
10:13:11,240 --> 10:13:12,380
I'm back!

11588
10:13:13,700 --> 10:13:14,680
It's fine.

11589
10:13:15,280 --> 10:13:16,100
I lived.

11590
10:13:16,100 --> 10:13:18,980
I don't have to play that stupid game.

11591
10:13:22,720 --> 10:13:27,720
I don't want my death because I don't have friends.

11592
10:13:28,000 --> 10:13:31,480
I don't want that to be me.

11593
10:13:32,040 --> 10:13:37,620
Guys, I don't want my death to be because I don't have friends.

11594
10:13:37,960 --> 10:13:39,040
Wait, wait a minute.

11595
10:13:39,220 --> 10:13:40,200
Did I glitch out?

11596
10:13:40,620 --> 10:13:41,880
Wait, am I gonna get shot?

11597
10:13:42,340 --> 10:13:44,460
Wait, I paid 75 robux.

11598
10:13:44,460 --> 10:13:46,240
Am I gonna get shot?

11599
10:13:50,800 --> 10:13:51,880
Oh no.

11600
10:13:53,640 --> 10:13:55,600
What do I do?

11601
10:13:57,540 --> 10:13:58,980
Oh my god.

11602
10:14:01,040 --> 10:14:02,580
Oh my god, I broke the game.

11603
10:14:03,140 --> 10:14:04,080
I broke the game.

11604
10:14:04,420 --> 10:14:05,780
Oh my god, thank god.

11605
10:14:06,160 --> 10:14:06,780
Yay!

11606
10:14:07,340 --> 10:14:08,740
I don't need friends.

11607
10:14:09,340 --> 10:14:10,600
I don't need friends.

11608
10:14:10,700 --> 10:14:11,540
I pay to win.

11609
10:14:11,540 --> 10:14:17,760
I I don't want to die friendless and alone.

11610
10:14:17,980 --> 10:14:23,100
I'm just now I'm friendless alone but a winner.

11611
10:14:23,720 --> 10:14:26,120
I don't want to die friendless alone and a loser.

11612
10:14:26,300 --> 10:14:31,620
I'd rather I'd rather be friendless alone and a winner.

11613
10:14:33,600 --> 10:14:36,180
Money is the only I would keep.

11614
10:14:36,180 --> 10:14:37,320
I love these.

11615
10:14:40,740 --> 10:14:42,100
How long is the cupid?

11616
10:14:42,160 --> 10:14:42,800
I don't know.

11617
10:14:42,920 --> 10:14:45,380
I played three games of roblox already.

11618
10:14:46,420 --> 10:14:47,020
Yay!

11619
10:14:47,780 --> 10:14:49,480
We did it.

11620
10:14:51,860 --> 10:14:53,140
What's the next game?

11621
10:14:54,460 --> 10:14:56,460
Guys, I was with you guys.

11622
10:14:56,660 --> 10:14:59,520
Oh my god, that was an insane game everybody.

11623
10:15:00,260 --> 10:15:01,500
Wait, Gojo's dead.

11624
10:15:02,340 --> 10:15:04,320
Wait, where did Gojo go?

11625
10:15:04,700 --> 10:15:07,400
Oh my god, Gojo's dead.

11626
10:15:08,200 --> 10:15:09,340
Oh my god.

11627
10:15:09,580 --> 10:15:12,780
Oh my god.

11628
10:15:13,060 --> 10:15:14,240
What happened?

11629
10:15:15,500 --> 10:15:17,360
Gojo didn't make it.

11630
10:15:17,420 --> 10:15:18,880
He died friendless.

11631
10:15:21,160 --> 10:15:22,560
He died alone.

11632
10:15:22,680 --> 10:15:24,700
Oh my god, it's the last place again.

11633
10:15:25,440 --> 10:15:26,220
Alright, watch this.

11634
10:15:27,400 --> 10:15:27,820
Okay.

11635
10:15:28,980 --> 10:15:29,420
Alright.

11636
10:15:30,440 --> 10:15:39,060
My dad works for this My dad helped make this game.

11637
10:15:39,380 --> 10:15:47,620
And he told me that usually it's the right most of the time.

11638
10:15:52,000 --> 10:15:55,220
Okay, but now it's not working because it's on the left side.

11639
10:15:55,300 --> 10:15:56,020
Oh, see, look.

11640
10:15:56,260 --> 10:15:58,280
See, it's working.

11641
10:15:58,880 --> 10:15:59,820
See, guys?

11642
10:16:00,140 --> 10:16:01,020
Look at that.

11643
10:16:02,220 --> 10:16:03,280
It works.

11644
10:16:03,280 --> 10:16:06,140
Now they're gonna go right again because I said that.

11645
10:16:08,900 --> 10:16:11,960
Oh my god, it's not working because it went left.

11646
10:16:15,940 --> 10:16:18,200
Now it's actually left.

11647
10:16:19,460 --> 10:16:21,740
Oh my god, there's 20 of us.

11648
10:16:21,860 --> 10:16:26,420
One of you, oh my god, see, since it's usually right, they're actually gonna think I'm right.

11649
10:16:27,400 --> 10:16:31,180
They're gonna be like, wait, she, oh my god, maybe her dad does work, did make this game.

11650
10:16:31,920 --> 10:16:35,920
Maybe her dad, look, see, that's what you get for not believing my dad.

11651
10:16:36,140 --> 10:16:38,460
That's what you get for not believing my dad.

11652
10:16:38,760 --> 10:16:42,220
You should have, you should have believed my dad.

11653
10:16:45,720 --> 10:16:46,480
Hey, Koro.

11654
10:16:47,020 --> 10:16:48,400
Oh, see, look at that.

11655
10:16:48,660 --> 10:16:49,540
That's what you get.

11656
10:16:50,700 --> 10:16:52,200
Wait, that's what you get.

11657
10:16:55,990 --> 10:16:56,750
Oh, yeah.

11658
10:16:57,410 --> 10:16:58,530
I knew it.

11659
10:16:58,910 --> 10:17:00,850
I fucking knew it's usually the right.

11660
10:17:00,850 --> 10:17:00,890
Okay.

11661
10:17:06,590 --> 10:17:08,390
It's usually the right side.

11662
10:17:12,340 --> 10:17:13,800
It's usually it.

11663
10:17:16,120 --> 10:17:17,360
Come on, children.

11664
10:17:19,100 --> 10:17:20,240
Come on.

11665
10:17:20,960 --> 10:17:22,260
Oh, wait, it's left this time.

11666
10:17:22,740 --> 10:17:23,580
What the fuck?

11667
10:17:24,380 --> 10:17:25,280
What a twist.

11668
10:17:27,680 --> 10:17:28,880
What a twist.

11669
10:17:31,040 --> 10:17:34,220
Wait, if I wrote I'm hacking right now, would they ban my account?

11670
10:17:37,180 --> 10:17:38,400
I'm hacking right now.

11671
10:17:38,480 --> 10:17:39,500
Can you go right?

11672
10:17:45,420 --> 10:17:47,100
Oh, I wanna be part of the crew.

11673
10:17:48,240 --> 10:17:48,940
Come on, guys.

11674
10:17:50,520 --> 10:17:51,080
Come on.

11675

Wait, what was two?

11676
10:17:52,600 --> 10:17:53,740
Wait, what's the pull?

11677
10:17:53,920 --> 10:17:55,560
What was the pull?

11678
10:17:55,560 --> 10:17:57,020
What was the pull?

11679
10:17:58,080 --> 10:18:00,100
Alright, watch this.

11680
10:18:04,670 --> 10:18:06,150
I have walls.

11681
10:18:07,070 --> 10:18:08,010
Wait, actually.

11682
10:18:11,230 --> 10:18:20,750
Usually, I play I've been playing for like for like five hours.

11683
10:18:21,270 --> 10:18:24,910
And usually, they make it to the right.

11684
10:18:33,490 --> 10:18:34,130
No.

11685
10:18:37,810 --> 10:18:39,050
God damn it.

11686
10:18:39,250 --> 10:18:40,910
I can't believe it's left.

11687
10:18:41,090 --> 10:18:44,810
Now they won't believe me anymore because it went left.

11688
10:18:45,170 --> 10:18:47,350
Now they won't believe me.

11689
10:18:52,080 --> 10:18:53,080
Alright, guys.

11690
10:18:53,240 --> 10:18:55,080
31 seconds, everybody.

11691
10:19:00,490 --> 10:19:02,570
What the fuck is this pattern?

11692
10:19:02,750 --> 10:19:04,250
It's like left, right, left, right.

11693
10:19:04,250 --> 10:19:04,330
Okay.

11694
10:19:05,640 --> 10:19:07,870
So I did three already.

11695
10:19:08,150 --> 10:19:09,490
Someone else help.

11696
10:19:12,230 --> 10:19:15,210
I did two.

11697
10:19:20,250 --> 10:19:22,110
Wait, he lived?

11698
10:19:23,010 --> 10:19:24,930
How did he live?

11699
10:19:27,130 --> 10:19:28,050
What?

11700
10:19:29,970 --> 10:19:31,350
Hacker.

11701
10:19:31,350 --> 10:19:31,410
Hacker.

11702
10:19:33,210 --> 10:19:34,530
Toki, why?

11703
10:19:35,030 --> 10:19:35,570
Why?

11704
10:19:37,050 --> 10:19:38,590
You're a child.

11705
10:19:38,890 --> 10:19:39,990
How do you remember?

11706
10:19:45,190 --> 10:19:47,030
How does he know?

11707
10:19:47,450 --> 10:19:48,990
How did he keep track?

11708
10:19:49,390 --> 10:19:50,610
Toki, why?

11709
10:19:56,990 --> 10:19:59,130
You're supposed to be a child.

11710
10:20:01,350 --> 10:20:03,030
How did he know?

11711
10:20:07,750 --> 10:20:11,230
Oh my god, I'm scared.

11712
10:20:11,730 --> 10:20:12,810
I'm scared.

11713
10:20:13,010 --> 10:20:15,610
What if he start punching me?

11714
10:20:16,990 --> 10:20:19,610
Guys, I played this game before.

11715
10:20:21,310 --> 10:20:22,390
No.

11716
10:20:22,950 --> 10:20:23,510
No.

11717
10:20:23,850 --> 10:20:24,770
No.

11718
10:20:25,710 --> 10:20:29,550
Oh my god.

11719
10:20:31,630 --> 10:20:32,510
Woah.

11720
10:20:32,670 --> 10:20:33,310
Woah.

11721
10:20:33,790 --> 10:20:34,670
Woah.

11722
10:20:35,370 --> 10:20:36,250
Woah.

11723
10:20:40,430 --> 10:20:43,070
What if we just...

11724
10:20:43,070 --> 10:20:44,790
I'm fucking defending my circle.

11725
10:20:45,330 --> 10:20:46,350
I'm defending it.

11726
10:20:46,670 --> 10:20:47,250
That's right.

11727
10:20:48,930 --> 10:20:50,790
One of us has to die.

11728
10:20:52,270 --> 10:20:52,550
Hey.

11729
10:20:52,990 --> 10:20:53,670
Hey.

11730
10:20:54,530 --> 10:20:55,290
Won't it be funny?

11731
10:20:56,010 --> 10:20:58,610
I'm about to get very silly.

11732
10:21:02,650 --> 10:21:03,210
Yeah.

11733
10:21:03,250 --> 10:21:04,650
How silly, my dude?

11734
10:21:05,650 --> 10:21:06,490
How silly?

11735
10:21:11,030 --> 10:21:11,590
Woah.

11736
10:21:12,150 --> 10:21:13,610
That's pretty silly.

11737
10:21:14,890 --> 10:21:16,590
That's pretty silly.

11738
10:21:17,650 --> 10:21:18,210
Woah.

11739
10:21:18,370 --> 10:21:18,610
Woah.

11740
10:21:18,770 --> 10:21:19,090
Woah.

11741
10:21:19,150 --> 10:21:19,450
Woah.

11742
10:21:19,690 --> 10:21:20,250
Woah.

11743
10:21:20,370 --> 10:21:20,590
Woah.

11744
10:21:20,770 --> 10:21:20,890
Woah.

11745
10:21:20,890 --> 10:21:23,510
What happened to being silly, guys?

11746
10:21:23,870 --> 10:21:25,490
Wait, do I just have to stand in these circles?

11747
10:21:26,450 --> 10:21:27,310
Is that it?

11748
10:21:29,550 --> 10:21:30,390
Is that it?

11749
10:21:30,390 --> 10:21:30,810
Is that it?

11750
10:21:36,270 --> 10:21:36,750
No?

11751
10:21:38,010 --> 10:21:38,490
Woah!

11752
10:21:42,370 --> 10:21:44,310
The most HP wins?

11753
10:21:44,550 --> 10:21:45,950
What the fuck does that mean?

11754
10:21:47,030 --> 10:21:49,250
Oh, it's a battle royale?

11755
10:21:49,610 --> 10:21:50,190
Oh shit.

11756
10:21:50,310 --> 10:21:51,830
Wait, maybe if I...

11757
10:21:51,830 --> 10:21:53,110
Alright, I have a lot of HP.

11758
10:21:53,970 --> 10:21:54,790
Oh my god.

11759
10:21:55,650 --> 10:21:56,470
Let's get him.

11760
10:21:56,630 --> 10:21:56,850
Let's get him.

11761
10:21:57,330 --> 10:21:59,930
Let's fucking get this one guy.

11762
10:21:59,930 --> 10:22:00,510
Yeah, that's right.

11763
10:22:00,550 --> 10:22:01,950
Let's get this guy.

11764
10:22:02,150 --> 10:22:03,150
You got this.

11765
10:22:03,550 --> 10:22:04,550
You got this.

11766
10:22:06,130 --> 10:22:08,130
You fucking got this, I believe.

11767
10:22:08,930 --> 10:22:09,910
Oh my god.

11768
10:22:11,770 --> 10:22:12,350
What?

11769
10:22:19,230 --> 10:22:20,830
How did he live?

11770
10:22:21,350 --> 10:22:23,510
How did the other guy live?

11771
10:22:24,070 --> 10:22:24,290
Wait.

11772
10:22:27,110 --> 10:22:29,430
How did the other guy live?

11773
10:22:32,860 --> 10:22:34,380
But there was two of us.

11774
10:22:39,720 --> 10:22:41,160
The punch him.

11775
10:22:45,040 --> 10:22:46,580
Wait, I did it!

11776
10:22:50,200 --> 10:22:51,320
Oh my god.

11777
10:22:51,460 --> 10:22:52,840
I thought we did it.

11778
10:22:53,280 --> 10:22:54,800
I thought me and him.

11779
10:22:54,900 --> 10:22:56,140
We were tight like that.

11780
10:22:57,040 --> 10:22:58,140
No one.

11781
10:22:58,620 --> 10:23:03,100
I thought we were both close like that.

11782
10:23:03,180 --> 10:23:04,420
We were both tight like that.

11783
10:23:04,460 --> 10:23:05,120
What happened?

11784
10:23:06,820 --> 10:23:08,220
Oh my god.

11785
10:23:08,700 --> 10:23:10,440
I can't believe it.

11786
10:23:10,900 --> 10:23:12,660
I can't believe that happened.

11787
10:23:14,840 --> 10:23:18,980
Guys, I don't understand the absolute explanations.

11788
10:23:20,180 --> 10:23:22,500
This has been my fourth Roblox game.

11789
10:23:23,480 --> 10:23:24,400
These queues.

11790
10:23:26,800 --> 10:23:29,160
This has been my fourth one.

11791
10:23:30,100 --> 10:23:32,120
This is a long queue.

11792
10:23:33,400 --> 10:23:36,240
We literally need one more.

11793
10:23:36,600 --> 10:23:38,740
That's the most fucked up part.

11794
10:23:40,020 --> 10:23:44,980
We need one more game and then we'd all be free.

11795
10:23:46,380 --> 10:23:48,980
Shout out to Gomez for sticking out.

11796
10:23:49,180 --> 10:23:51,980
Kurova fucking head to bed.

11797
10:23:52,060 --> 10:23:53,760
He was like, I'm fucking heading to sleep.

11798
10:23:54,200 --> 10:23:58,040
I won't say gave up but he's like, these queues are too long.

11799
10:23:58,100 --> 10:23:59,320
It's way too late now.

11800
10:24:00,200 --> 10:24:03,260
Shout out to Gomez for sticking it out.

11801
10:24:11,840 --> 10:24:14,280
Our first victim was Mace.

11802
10:24:14,400 --> 10:24:15,960
Our second was Kurova.

11803
10:24:17,140 --> 10:24:19,620
Oh my god, what the fuck is that face?

11804
10:24:26,860 --> 10:24:31,340
Shout out to the entire squad for like making it this far.

11805
10:24:32,600 --> 10:24:34,560
Oh my god, we got a game!

11806
10:24:34,940 --> 10:24:39,240
Okay, I gotta punch a child first before I have time.

11807
10:24:39,240 --> 10:24:41,200
Legitimately have time.

11808
10:24:42,460 --> 10:24:44,280
I legitimately have time.

11809
10:24:48,580 --> 10:24:49,840
Alright, I'm ready.

11810
10:24:52,980 --> 10:24:54,340
I'm so ready.

11811
10:24:54,440 --> 10:24:55,720
Where are all the children at?

11812
10:24:56,980 --> 10:24:57,560
C'mon, c'mon.

11813
10:24:58,100 --> 10:24:59,520
C'mon, c'mon.

11814
10:24:59,520 --> 10:25:00,370
C'mon, let me...

11815
10:25:00,740 --> 10:25:01,000
C'mon.

11816
10:25:02,600 --> 10:25:03,100
C'mon.

11817
10:25:03,100 --> 10:25:06,140
If we lose, you gotta do two more probably tomorrow.

11818
10:25:09,320 --> 10:25:14,820
I was like, you gotta lock it and I'm right here playing Roblox.

11819
10:25:19,500 --> 10:25:22,300
Everyone, please, do it.

11820
10:25:23,320 --> 10:25:25,860
If only he knew.

11821
10:25:26,920 --> 10:25:28,580
If only he knew.

11822
10:25:33,200 --> 10:25:36,300
If only she still locked it.

11823
10:25:37,420 --> 10:25:39,300
Oh my god, I made it just in time.

11824
10:25:39,500 --> 10:25:40,120
Make a wall!

11825
10:25:40,380 --> 10:25:41,320
Make a wall, children!

11826
10:25:41,940 --> 10:25:43,040
Make a wall!

11827
10:25:47,060 --> 10:25:48,120
Make a wall.

11828
10:25:48,560 --> 10:25:49,320
I'm ready.

11829
10:25:50,080 --> 10:25:51,140
Make a wall.

11830
10:25:51,300 --> 10:25:52,480
Make a fucking wall.

11831
10:25:52,600 --> 10:25:53,900
Don't let the guy in.

11832
10:25:53,980 --> 10:25:55,180
Don't let them in.

11833
10:25:55,680 --> 10:25:57,160
Nevermind, I'm gonna fucking go.

11834
10:25:57,380 --> 10:25:58,740
C'mon, you know you want me.

11835
10:25:58,860 --> 10:26:00,180
You know this is gonna happen.

11836
10:26:06,380 --> 10:26:07,240
Alright, alright.

11837
10:26:07,460 --> 10:26:08,180
I'm locked in.

11838
10:26:08,260 --> 10:26:09,900
Oh my god, I'm fucking Raccoon.

11839
10:26:10,140 --> 10:26:12,880
Okay, this is a little concerning.

11840
10:26:14,840 --> 10:26:17,060
This is a little concerning.

11841
10:26:17,320 --> 10:26:18,760
I saw a Raccoon player.

11842
10:26:21,200 --> 10:26:21,620
Alright.

11843
10:26:24,180 --> 10:26:25,720
Don't worry about it.

11844
10:26:25,960 --> 10:26:27,100
One of them's a Raccoon.

11845
10:26:27,120 --> 10:26:28,040
Okay, we got it.

11846
10:26:28,500 --> 10:26:30,020
Alright, goodbye Roblox.

11847
10:26:30,140 --> 10:26:32,500
We almost won that one game.

11848
10:26:37,050 --> 10:26:41,570
I like how Gobus was like we probably have to get it tomorrow.

11849
10:26:44,590 --> 10:26:45,630
Alright, you're chillin' then.

11850
10:26:45,950 --> 10:26:47,490
We'll play around it.

11851
10:26:48,170 --> 10:26:50,230
And then if we can't, then I'm gonna blame you.

11852
10:26:56,250 --> 10:26:58,850
When you have a burn out, I disappear.

11853
10:27:02,530 --> 10:27:02,870
Alright.

11854
10:27:06,910 --> 10:27:08,570
Alright, here we go.

11855
10:27:11,230 --> 10:27:20,570
4 3 2 1 What is he doing?

11856
10:27:23,490 --> 10:27:24,790
I don't think so.

11857
10:27:25,730 --> 10:27:27,530
I don't think so.

11858
10:27:27,530 --> 10:27:27,650
Oh.

11859
10:27:30,650 --> 10:27:35,750
Nope, we're just walking the weirdest pathway I've ever seen.

11860
10:27:41,170 --> 10:27:41,590
Alright.

11861
10:27:45,130 --> 10:27:45,550
Alright.

11862
10:27:51,300 --> 10:27:54,320
Let's just casually walk to high ground, guys.

11863
10:27:57,440 --> 10:27:57,860
Wait.

11864
10:27:58,720 --> 10:27:59,800
She's low, she's low, she's 1.

11865
10:28:02,980 --> 10:28:06,560
Why did it take us 20 years to- wait, I'm 3 slow.

11866
10:28:11,090 --> 10:28:12,550
Why did we- okay.

11867
10:28:20,850 --> 10:28:22,170
There's a Magneton on point.

11868
10:28:22,170 --> 10:28:22,230
Magneton on point.

11869
10:28:27,830 --> 10:28:32,570
I'm ulting, I'm ulting.

11870
10:28:33,600 --> 10:28:34,970
Oh my god.

11871
10:28:41,420 --> 10:28:44,750
Oh my- I froze- I froze Strange.

11872
10:28:47,400 --> 10:28:48,750
Oh, the item!

11873
10:28:48,750 --> 10:28:48,950
The item!

11874
10:28:52,390 --> 10:28:54,470
Oh, that was so close.

11875
10:28:55,090 --> 10:28:57,830
Why did we not kill the Magneto?

11876
10:29:02,910 --> 10:29:04,330
Oh my god.

11877
10:29:05,270 --> 10:29:06,290
That's crazy.

11878
10:29:06,470 --> 10:29:08,910
We didn't kill- we didn't kill Magneto there.

11879
10:29:10,050 --> 10:29:12,310
Why did we not kill the turret?

11880
10:29:12,890 --> 10:29:15,470
Did you see the turret that free farm?

11881
10:29:15,830 --> 10:29:16,710
I'm still as old.

11882
10:29:28,500 --> 10:29:30,460
Fear, fear, fear.

11883
10:29:31,480 --> 10:29:32,440
He's 1, he's 1!

11884
10:29:48,560 --> 10:29:51,020
I got Nemo.

11885
10:29:53,060 --> 10:29:54,060
Focus Strange, Strange on point!

11886
10:29:54,940 --> 10:29:55,720
Strange 1, Strange 1.

11887
10:29:56,300 --> 10:29:56,980
Magneto, Magneto.

11888
10:29:59,140 --> 10:30:00,240
Oh my god.

11889
10:30:01,540 --> 10:30:02,800
Oh my god.

11890
10:30:02,900 --> 10:30:03,900
I'm locked in.

11891
10:30:04,020 --> 10:30:06,080
I'm so locked in.

11892
10:30:06,180 --> 10:30:07,880
Oh my god.

11893
10:30:10,100 --> 10:30:12,060
I'm so locked in.

11894
10:30:12,240 --> 10:30:13,200
Oh my god.

11895
10:30:13,560 --> 10:30:15,360
You almost fucking died.

11896
10:30:16,080 --> 10:30:18,360
But I'm still locked in.

11897
10:30:21,140 --> 10:30:21,520
Alright.

11898
10:30:24,980 --> 10:30:25,040
What?

11899
10:30:25,980 --> 10:30:26,860
You have no morale here.

11900
10:30:30,300 --> 10:30:31,500
I froze Strange.

11901
10:30:34,400 --> 10:30:34,760
Oh.

11902
10:30:35,800 --> 10:30:36,540
I have an ult.

11903
10:30:36,620 --> 10:30:36,860
I'm ulting.

11904
10:30:40,520 --> 10:30:41,520
I'm pushing up with it.

11905
10:30:44,980 --> 10:30:45,340
Woah.

11906
10:30:46,980 --> 10:30:48,040
Woah, we should help her.

11907
10:30:48,220 --> 10:30:48,620
We'll be in it.

11908
10:31:00,030 --> 10:31:00,870
I have to reload.

11909
10:31:03,450 --> 10:31:04,770
Oh my god, they're horde chasing me.

11910
10:31:07,130 --> 10:31:08,850
Wait, mag, mag, mag, mag, mag 1.

11911
10:31:09,430 --> 10:31:09,910
Nice,

11912
10:31:13,410 --> 10:31:14,070
nice, we got port.

11913
10:31:16,010 --> 10:31:16,250
No!

11914
10:31:21,830 --> 10:31:23,790
I'm keeping them up.

11915
10:31:26,350 --> 10:31:27,550
The Strange is chasing you?

11916
10:31:27,610 --> 10:31:27,910
Nevermind.

11917
10:31:28,570 --> 10:31:29,530
Strange half, Strange half.

11918
10:31:33,110 --> 10:31:33,990
Oh my god.

11919
10:31:34,150 --> 10:31:34,890
Oh my god, he's frozen, he's frozen.

11920
10:31:39,890 --> 10:31:40,730
He's half again?

11921
10:31:42,710 --> 10:31:44,030
Oh my god, please.

11922
10:31:44,370 --> 10:31:45,170
They have Strange ult here.

11923
10:31:48,470 --> 10:31:50,710
Oh, I'm dead, I'm dead.

11924
10:31:51,090 --> 10:31:52,490
I froze Strange, I froze Strange.

11925
10:31:53,450 --> 10:31:54,250
He got healed.

11926
10:31:56,630 --> 10:31:58,250
He's looking for ult, he's looking for ult.

11927
10:32:04,800 --> 10:32:05,660
I'm sorry.

11928
10:32:06,060 --> 10:32:07,960
Every time I...

11929
10:32:10,720 --> 10:32:13,960
Every time I see him, I just think...

11930
10:32:18,840 --> 10:32:20,060
Mantis is trying to run.

11931
10:32:20,500 --> 10:32:21,700
Do you have TP for spawn?

11932
10:32:21,700 --> 10:32:22,660
Yeah, yeah.

11933
10:32:26,500 --> 10:32:27,900
Nice.

11934
10:32:34,980 --> 10:32:41,780
Oh my god.

11935
10:32:41,800 --> 10:32:43,900
Did they actually?

11936
10:32:45,160 --> 10:32:46,700
Oh my god.

11937
10:32:50,000 --> 10:32:51,060
Oh my god.

11938
10:32:51,060 --> 10:32:51,520
Oh my god.

11939
10:32:51,680 --> 10:32:53,960
This is one last push.

11940
10:32:54,660 --> 10:32:56,760
And then we're all free and I'm back on YouTube.

11941
10:32:59,180 --> 10:33:00,800
Oh my god.

11942
10:33:02,080 --> 10:33:04,240
My Luna thinks purple is healing.

11943
10:33:04,520 --> 10:33:05,040
Is it?

11944
10:33:10,340 --> 10:33:11,320
That's rough.

11945
10:33:12,480 --> 10:33:13,680
That's rough, buddy.

11946
10:33:18,000 --> 10:33:18,840
Oh.

11947
10:33:22,800 --> 10:33:24,060
That's a...

11948
10:33:24,500 --> 10:33:26,240
That's a gear up, buddy.

11949
10:33:28,340 --> 10:33:29,540
Oh my god.

11950
10:33:32,500 --> 10:33:34,260
I told you guys.

11951
10:33:34,400 --> 10:33:35,640
The ROBLOX...

11952
10:33:35,640 --> 10:33:37,320
I told you guys.

11953
10:33:37,780 --> 10:33:39,840
The ROBLOX saved me.

11954
10:33:40,260 --> 10:33:42,860
I let up my bad luck in ROBLOX.

11955
10:33:48,400 --> 10:33:50,660
Was she using the bug and I got stuck?

11956
10:33:50,820 --> 10:33:52,000
I told you guys.

11957
10:33:52,260 --> 10:33:52,820
The bug...

11958
10:33:58,500 --> 10:34:00,100
Oh my god.

11959
10:34:00,360 --> 10:34:02,100
We're gonna be free, guys.

11960
10:34:02,460 --> 10:34:03,460
We're gonna be free.

11961
10:34:09,480 --> 10:34:11,220
Oh my god.

11962
10:34:11,740 --> 10:34:13,400
We're gonna be free.

11963
10:34:13,400 --> 10:34:13,660
We're gonna be free.

11964
10:34:15,440 --> 10:34:17,400
There's the key behind me.

11965
10:34:17,660 --> 10:34:18,040
Wait, what?

11966
10:34:19,720 --> 10:34:20,260
You guys ready?

11967
10:34:20,620 --> 10:34:21,180
Yeah.

11968
10:34:23,880 --> 10:34:25,760
Oh my god.

11969
10:34:27,540 --> 10:34:28,260
Oh,

11970
10:34:31,720 --> 10:34:32,340
he's back.

11971
10:34:32,360 --> 10:34:34,380
Do it, do it.

11972
10:34:35,340 --> 10:34:36,560
Get that Nemora.

11973
10:34:42,190 --> 10:34:44,230
That was so cool.

11974
10:34:48,970 --> 10:34:49,910
Wait, stagger, stagger.

11975
10:34:50,050 --> 10:34:50,630
Don't kill, don't kill.

11976
10:34:51,230 --> 10:34:52,650
Yeah, don't kill her, don't kill her.

11977
10:34:52,930 --> 10:34:53,310
Keep her here.

11978
10:34:55,070 --> 10:34:56,010
Close the supports.

11979
10:34:57,350 --> 10:34:57,890
Wait, wait, wait.

11980
10:34:58,850 --> 10:34:59,210
Oh.

11981
10:35:01,550 --> 10:35:01,910
Nice.

11982
10:35:02,290 --> 10:35:03,770
Can we not play?

11983
10:35:13,250 --> 10:35:14,750
What are they doing?

11984
10:35:14,750 --> 10:35:18,010
We don't have a team that's on the main.

11985
10:35:18,190 --> 10:35:20,390
That's actually so...

11986
10:35:21,090 --> 10:35:22,450
That's so rough.

11987
10:35:24,690 --> 10:35:26,930
I can't believe this is my...

11988
10:35:26,930 --> 10:35:29,310
This is my top 500 secure game.

11989
10:35:29,770 --> 10:35:36,130
Out of all my games, this is how we end it.

11990
10:35:36,790 --> 10:35:39,190
This is how we end it.

11991
10:35:39,690 --> 10:35:41,110
Holy fuck.

11992
10:35:41,450 --> 10:35:47,350
We have a rocket raccoon and we're against a team that has like four support players.

11993
10:35:51,170 --> 10:35:52,650
That's crazy.

11994
10:35:53,710 --> 10:35:53,970
What?

11995
10:35:54,370 --> 10:35:55,630
What is this luck?

11996
10:35:56,410 --> 10:36:02,210
We struggled so hard and then like this is how we...

11997
10:36:02,210 --> 10:36:04,110
This is how we end our...

11998
10:36:04,110 --> 10:36:07,470
This is how we end our Marvel Rivals break up.

11999
10:36:07,770 --> 10:36:08,970
It's gonna be in a video.

12000
10:36:08,970 --> 10:36:13,110
We got it and then it's like... Anyway, this was our final game.

12001
10:36:14,390 --> 10:36:17,490
We played against a team that had four support players.

12002
10:36:18,270 --> 10:36:18,930
Life's great.

12003
10:36:20,870 --> 10:36:21,610
Oh shit.

12004
10:36:21,910 --> 10:36:33,870
Oh my god!

12005
10:36:33,990 --> 10:36:35,930
That was right at my face!

12006
10:36:37,530 --> 10:36:38,650
Wait, strangers won.

12007
10:36:43,040 --> 10:36:46,240
Oh, that guy was like fuck that raccoon in particular.

12008
10:36:52,570 --> 10:36:53,050
Bro,

12009
10:36:56,210 --> 10:36:58,970
that guy actually fucking threw it at the entrance.

12010
10:36:59,190 --> 10:36:59,990
That's crazy.

12011
10:37:02,890 --> 10:37:03,890
I told you!

12012
10:37:03,990 --> 10:37:05,070
That's why I'm like...

12013
10:37:05,070 --> 10:37:08,190
Why don't you do the exploit?

12014
10:37:11,790 --> 10:37:12,690
Wait, what's the skin?

12015
10:37:12,790 --> 10:37:13,530
I can't see it.

12016
10:37:15,430 --> 10:37:16,950
Oh my god, I'm gonna die.

12017
10:37:24,670 --> 10:37:25,150
Nice.

12018
10:37:26,030 --> 10:37:26,830
Wait, what?

12019
10:37:27,070 --> 10:37:28,570
Wait, there's a mantis behind his rocket!

12020
10:37:31,810 --> 10:37:32,890
Oh my god!

12021
10:37:33,050 --> 10:37:33,350
What?

12022
10:37:41,960 --> 10:37:46,280
We might be, yeah, just a little bit.

12023
10:37:46,640 --> 10:37:48,300
What happened?

12024
10:37:48,820 --> 10:37:50,820
I just said I'll do it myself.

12025
10:37:54,160 --> 10:37:56,000
Oh god, mantis.

12026
10:37:56,800 --> 10:37:58,120
Oh my god.

12027
10:37:58,300 --> 10:38:00,400
He fucking soloed me and the rocket.

12028
10:38:01,220 --> 10:38:03,240
To be fair, the mantis had like...

12029
10:38:03,240 --> 10:38:05,740
The mantis got me low already though, guys.

12030
10:38:05,820 --> 10:38:06,240
Come on.

12031
10:38:06,340 --> 10:38:08,960
Can't give credit too much to it.

12032
10:38:08,960 --> 10:38:09,180
Alright.

12033
10:38:13,340 --> 10:38:14,920
Alright, let's give it to Gomez.

12034
10:38:15,580 --> 10:38:16,260
You're gonna need it.

12035
10:38:22,080 --> 10:38:23,300
Oh my god.

12036
10:38:23,460 --> 10:38:23,800
Nice.

12037
10:38:25,720 --> 10:38:29,300
No, you're fine.

12038
10:38:29,400 --> 10:38:30,260
You're so healthy.

12039
10:38:34,120 --> 10:38:34,600
Yeah.

12040
10:38:38,340 --> 10:38:39,920
Nice, that was pretty cool.

12041
10:38:40,360 --> 10:38:41,400
Thank you, thank you.

12042
10:38:44,900 --> 10:38:46,360
Oh my god, please.

12043
10:38:47,460 --> 10:38:47,980
Please.

12044
10:38:48,440 --> 10:38:48,820
Live!

12045
10:39:00,930 --> 10:39:01,450
Nice.

12046
10:39:04,290 --> 10:39:06,030
Don't worry, I'll give it to Gomez.

12047
10:39:07,170 --> 10:39:08,810
Bro, I have one hour on tank.

12048
10:39:08,930 --> 10:39:09,590
I can't!

12049
10:39:12,030 --> 10:39:12,910
Oh my god.

12050
10:39:15,410 --> 10:39:16,430
The rest of them are not.

12051
10:39:16,870 --> 10:39:19,070
The rest of them are not.

12052
10:39:23,750 --> 10:39:24,950
Oh my god.

12053
10:39:26,070 --> 10:39:27,670
You know what, maybe this game...

12054
10:39:27,670 --> 10:39:29,790
Fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear.

12055
10:39:42,090 --> 10:39:42,990
I'm gonna die.

12056
10:39:42,990 --> 10:39:44,150
Oh my god.

12057
10:39:44,150 --> 10:39:47,490
I don't know how I lived that.

12058
10:39:47,750 --> 10:39:49,270
Okay, okay.

12059
10:39:49,910 --> 10:39:54,310
I saw the whale and I was like, I think I gotta stop.

12060
10:39:55,170 --> 10:39:58,410
Oh my god.

12061
10:39:59,270 --> 10:40:01,490
They're just walking up to us.

12062
10:40:04,170 --> 10:40:06,230
What do we do?

12063
10:40:10,150 --> 10:40:13,110
Oh, goodbye.

12064
10:40:14,470 --> 10:40:15,310
Unless...

12065
10:40:15,310 --> 10:40:20,070
I froze him, I froze him, I froze him.

12066
10:40:20,490 --> 10:40:24,650
They just walk up slowly to us.

12067
10:40:25,070 --> 10:40:26,930
That was so scary.

12068
10:40:27,450 --> 10:40:30,150
He just like walked up to us.

12069
10:40:32,410 --> 10:40:33,630
It's over.

12070
10:40:34,470 --> 10:40:35,590
It's over.

12071
10:40:38,510 --> 10:40:39,770
It's 11 hours.

12072
10:40:41,230 --> 10:40:43,190
Oh my god.

12073
10:40:43,250 --> 10:40:44,370
It's like over.

12074
10:40:44,830 --> 10:40:46,410
It's actually over.

12075
10:40:47,230 --> 10:40:48,350
We're all here.

12076
10:40:48,570 --> 10:40:49,610
We're all free.

12077
10:40:50,870 --> 10:40:52,730
Oh and I got MVP.

12078
10:40:52,890 --> 10:40:53,770
Let's go!

12079
10:40:56,960 --> 10:40:58,560
Oh my god.

12080
10:40:59,540 --> 10:41:02,520
And I got MVP for it.

12081
10:41:03,060 --> 10:41:04,600
You know what, I'll take those.

12082
10:41:04,800 --> 10:41:06,660
I can take those.

12083
10:41:07,160 --> 10:41:08,720
Oh my god.

12084
10:41:09,780 --> 10:41:10,960
Let's go.

12085
10:41:10,960 --> 10:41:11,120
Oh.

12086
10:41:16,220 --> 10:41:18,720
Oh my god, I'm at the bottom!

12087
10:41:19,040 --> 10:41:19,560
Let's go!

12088
10:41:19,880 --> 10:41:20,780
Like always.

12089
10:41:20,900 --> 10:41:22,840
Alright guys, as per tradition.

12090
10:41:23,620 --> 10:41:25,280
As per tradition.

12091
10:41:25,780 --> 10:41:26,460
Where am I?

12092
10:41:27,180 --> 10:41:28,360
Alright, there it is.

12093
10:41:29,180 --> 10:41:29,820
There I am.

12094
10:41:30,720 --> 10:41:31,260
We're here.

12095
10:41:31,580 --> 10:41:32,740
Oh my god, do you see that?

12096
10:41:33,380 --> 10:41:34,140
Do you see that?

12097
10:41:34,540 --> 10:41:35,760
Oh my god, do you see that?

12098
10:41:36,360 --> 10:41:38,060
Oh my god, that's me.

12099
10:41:38,060 --> 10:41:39,480
That's me.

12100
10:41:41,910 --> 10:41:43,380
Oh my god.

12101
10:41:43,400 --> 10:41:45,280
That's me right there.

12102
10:41:45,280 --> 10:41:46,220
That's me.

12103
10:41:47,020 --> 10:41:49,440
Oh my god, we did it.

12104
10:41:53,590 --> 10:41:57,960
Thank you for playing through hell.

12105
10:41:59,640 --> 10:42:02,280
I'm sorry for the trauma.

12106
10:42:08,060 --> 10:42:09,020
It's okay.

12107
10:42:10,880 --> 10:42:13,200
I'm used to it.

12108
10:42:13,580 --> 10:42:16,000
Roblox was always the answer.

12109
10:42:21,980 --> 10:42:23,420
At least...

12110
10:42:23,420 --> 10:42:26,660
At least you are now a stronger person.

12111
10:42:27,120 --> 10:42:30,220
And you appreciate your team more.

12112
10:42:30,220 --> 10:42:30,280
Alright.

12113
10:42:35,960 --> 10:42:38,320
The Roblox pregame.

12114
10:42:39,560 --> 10:42:44,140
Therapy can't fix what I've Bro, I don't think he's okay.

12115
10:42:44,420 --> 10:42:47,060
I don't think he's okay.

12116
10:42:48,460 --> 10:42:51,520
Therapy can't fix what I've been through.

12117
10:42:51,860 --> 10:42:54,000
Oh my god, cash out the prediction.

12118
10:42:55,460 --> 10:42:57,220
Guys, it's time to cash out.

12119
10:42:57,220 --> 10:42:59,300
They stuck it through the end.

12120
10:42:59,460 --> 10:43:01,880
I broke him, but that's not new.

12121
10:43:02,200 --> 10:43:03,860
That's not new guys.

12122
10:43:04,180 --> 10:43:05,480
Alright, here's the history.

12123
10:43:05,780 --> 10:43:07,100
This is actually crazy.

12124
10:43:07,260 --> 10:43:09,160
We started out so rough.

12125
10:43:09,460 --> 10:43:13,700
We started out so fucking rough earlier.

12126
10:43:14,240 --> 10:43:15,520
Oh my god.

12127
10:43:15,660 --> 10:43:16,860
What the fuck.

12128
10:43:17,400 --> 10:43:19,180
But like, this is where we started out.

12129
10:43:19,260 --> 10:43:20,400
Like, the four losses.

12130
10:43:21,020 --> 10:43:22,400
That's where we were at.

12131
10:43:22,600 --> 10:43:23,240
And then like...

12132
10:43:23,820 --> 10:43:26,920
And then like, we started and it got a lot better.

12133
10:43:27,260 --> 10:43:27,800
A lot.

12134
10:43:28,520 --> 10:43:30,840
And then this one is when I started playing.

12135
10:43:30,920 --> 10:43:32,360
I think this was when... Was it here?

12136
10:43:32,540 --> 10:43:32,920
Or here?

12137
10:43:33,260 --> 10:43:34,540
It was like one of these.

12138
10:43:34,960 --> 10:43:38,320
When I started playing, I did like Roblox pregame.

12139
10:43:38,400 --> 10:43:39,180
Like right here.

12140
10:43:39,380 --> 10:43:41,660
And then like, just things started looking great.

12141
10:43:42,260 --> 10:43:42,740
Like...

12142
10:43:47,020 --> 10:43:51,740
We were playing... We did Roblox pregame around this time.

12143
10:43:52,240 --> 10:43:54,840
And then we just kept winning.

12144
10:43:55,760 --> 10:43:57,160
Oh my god.

12145
10:43:57,560 --> 10:43:58,080
Alright.

12146
10:43:58,280 --> 10:44:00,800
The chemistry was terrible between me and Kurova.

12147
10:44:00,980 --> 10:44:03,040
We had negative chemistry together.

12148
10:44:03,120 --> 10:44:04,580
We had negative synergy together.

12149
10:44:04,680 --> 10:44:05,880
We just kept double support ulting.

12150
10:44:06,160 --> 10:44:08,800
And then I was in my own head about support ults.

12151
10:44:08,940 --> 10:44:13,400
So then I just stopped ulting because I was like, what if I double support ult?

12152
10:44:13,560 --> 10:44:15,400
And then I stopped ulting.

12153
10:44:15,520 --> 10:44:17,820
And then I was like, I'm sorry Kurova.

12154
10:44:17,940 --> 10:44:18,660
I'm so sorry.

12155
10:44:18,960 --> 10:44:20,960
And then slowly, we didn't need therapy.

12156
10:44:20,960 --> 10:44:23,640
We didn't need support counsel therapy.

12157
10:44:23,840 --> 10:44:25,100
Like couple counseling therapy.

12158
10:44:25,300 --> 10:44:28,880
We just, we did our best to fucking tough it out.

12159
10:44:29,040 --> 10:44:31,160
And then we started figuring our synergy.

12160
10:44:31,560 --> 10:44:33,200
And things got a lot better.

12161
10:44:33,520 --> 10:44:34,520
Things got...

12162
10:44:34,520 --> 10:44:38,980
We have like 0 point... We have like 1% synergy now, guys.

12163
10:44:39,860 --> 10:44:41,080
We have...

12164
10:44:41,080 --> 10:44:44,740
We have 1% synergy now.

12165
10:44:44,940 --> 10:44:45,960
I'm proud of us.

12166
10:44:47,000 --> 10:44:48,280
I'm so proud of us.

12167
10:44:48,800 --> 10:44:49,280
Yes.

12168
10:44:55,340 --> 10:44:57,960
Do I deserve an ad now?

12169
10:44:58,220 --> 10:44:59,400
Wait, did he ad me?

12170
10:45:00,160 --> 10:45:01,840
I don't even know if he ad... Oh, he did.

12171
10:45:02,020 --> 10:45:03,180
I didn't know they added me.

12172
10:45:03,260 --> 10:45:04,040
I don't check.

12173
10:45:04,220 --> 10:45:05,840
People fucking... I don't check.

12174
10:45:06,660 --> 10:45:07,880
Yes, you... Yes.

12175
10:45:08,060 --> 10:45:09,340
You did it, gamer.

12176
10:45:09,340 --> 10:45:09,400
You did it, gamer.

12177
10:45:15,860 --> 10:45:18,800
I didn't know I was looking at my history.

12178
10:45:19,200 --> 10:45:21,880
I'm not adding Mr. Fister, guys.

12179
10:45:23,200 --> 10:45:26,120
This guy gave traumas in my stack.

12180
10:45:26,360 --> 10:45:30,580
Literally, they all started beating the shit out of Iron Fist in the practice range.

12181
10:45:30,880 --> 10:45:34,320
Him and the other guy, the big MacBook guy.

12182
10:45:35,820 --> 10:45:37,140
Why not?

12183
10:45:38,380 --> 10:45:41,260
Him, this guy, and... Fuck this.

12184
10:45:41,400 --> 10:45:41,800
I'm sorry.

12185
10:45:41,960 --> 10:45:44,400
You might be a wonderful person, but you're a Raccoon player.

12186
10:45:45,140 --> 10:45:45,560
You could...

12187
10:45:48,020 --> 10:45:50,760
You could be a wonderful fucking person.

12188
10:45:52,860 --> 10:45:54,480
But we did it, everybody.

12189
10:45:54,680 --> 10:45:55,420
We're free.

12190
10:45:55,840 --> 10:45:59,040
I swear to God, if the cutoff...

12191
10:45:59,040 --> 10:46:00,800
I swear to God, if...

12192
10:46:00,800 --> 10:46:01,920
How many days do we have left?

12193
10:46:03,320 --> 10:46:04,100
How many days?

12194
10:46:04,100 --> 10:46:05,260
Two days.

12195
10:46:05,600 --> 10:46:12,020
And if like in three days, if in three days, the cutoff, I swear to God...

12196
10:46:12,020 --> 10:46:19,980
Oh my... I swear to God, if in three days, the cutoff is more than two...

12197
10:46:19,980 --> 10:46:20,760
Where am I?

12198
10:46:21,920 --> 10:46:22,560
268?

12199
10:46:22,640 --> 10:46:23,460
Oh my God.

12200
10:46:23,640 --> 10:46:26,260
I swear to fucking God, I would freaking freak out.

12201
10:46:26,720 --> 10:46:27,000
I...

12202
10:46:29,740 --> 10:46:31,020
I will...

12203
10:46:31,020 --> 10:46:32,100
I will...

12204
10:46:32,100 --> 10:46:34,800
Freak out if the cutoff goes higher.

12205
10:46:34,940 --> 10:46:35,560
I...

12206
10:46:35,800 --> 10:46:38,280
I wanna be free, guys.

12207
10:46:38,800 --> 10:46:39,220
I...

12208
10:46:39,220 --> 10:46:41,180
I swear, I...

12209
10:46:41,180 --> 10:46:44,880
I don't know if I can survive longer.

12210
10:46:45,240 --> 10:46:46,380
I don't know.

12211
10:46:48,880 --> 10:46:49,600
I don't know.

12212
10:46:49,600 --> 10:46:52,480
If in two days, I start worrying...

12213
10:46:52,480 --> 10:46:54,340
And he got... He got...

12214
10:46:55,300 --> 10:46:56,640
He got like...

12215
10:46:56,640 --> 10:46:58,200
Wait, we're almost the same!

12216
10:46:58,800 --> 10:47:00,360
I'm just as good as you!

12217
10:47:05,800 --> 10:47:07,700
We're like almost the same.

12218
10:47:07,820 --> 10:47:09,020
We're like almost the same.

12219
10:47:09,100 --> 10:47:09,720
No, I'm not.

12220
10:47:10,620 --> 10:47:12,880
They're fucking a lot better than us.

12221
10:47:13,080 --> 10:47:16,280
They're so much better than me.

12222
10:47:18,460 --> 10:47:20,060
If you need us, call the Avengers.

12223
10:47:20,300 --> 10:47:22,940
As a long-time fan, I will answer.

12224
10:47:23,080 --> 10:47:24,940
Oh my God, is he a Dragoon?

12225
10:47:25,700 --> 10:47:26,540
Prove it.

12226
10:47:28,220 --> 10:47:31,980
I shouldn't He helped me get here.

12227
10:47:32,180 --> 10:47:35,320
Oh my- I mean, he was the one that stuck it out.

12228
10:47:35,520 --> 10:47:40,120
He was the remaining player that stuck out to the end.

12229
10:47:41,020 --> 10:47:44,120
He literally stuck out to the end to be there.

12230
10:47:44,780 --> 10:47:45,840
To be here.

12231
10:47:47,220 --> 10:47:50,320
Everybody else went to bed or crashed out.

12232
10:47:50,760 --> 10:47:53,960
Hogs replaced Mace because Mace crashed out.

12233
10:47:54,460 --> 10:47:55,940
Mace was having a rough day.

12234
10:47:56,420 --> 10:47:58,560
He was having a rough day.

12235
10:47:58,560 --> 10:48:01,300
But shoutout to Mace for organizing the stack.

12236
10:48:01,360 --> 10:48:02,320
He did not have to.

12237
10:48:02,420 --> 10:48:06,200
I literally was like, I don't think I'm gonna make it.

12238
10:48:06,360 --> 10:48:08,160
And then he was like, we're gonna get you there.

12239
10:48:08,400 --> 10:48:10,360
And then he organized this entire stack.

12240
10:48:10,840 --> 10:48:20,700
And then, shoutout to Kurova, Gomez, Hogs, Mace for going through 10 hours of fucking hell.

12241
10:48:25,040 --> 10:48:27,300
We went through stream snipers.

12242
10:48:27,300 --> 10:48:31,360
We went through, like, 4 stacks trying to get rank 1.

12243
10:48:31,840 --> 10:48:36,220
And then, like, trying to farm me for rank 1.

12244
10:48:38,020 --> 10:48:40,420
We went through so much.

12245
10:48:40,840 --> 10:48:43,900
I got- I went through so much pain.

12246
10:48:44,680 --> 10:48:47,620
I'm just a little, like, make-a-wish VTuber.

12247
10:48:47,980 --> 10:48:51,260
Trying to get to top 500 for the first time.

12248
10:48:51,720 --> 10:48:54,680
And then top 500 for this game.

12249
10:48:54,680 --> 10:48:59,840
And then I had, like, 3 different 4 stacks just being like, fuck you.

12250
10:49:03,540 --> 10:49:04,440
Oh my god.

12251
10:49:04,440 --> 10:49:06,640
Huge shoutout to all the people that played with me.

12252
10:49:06,840 --> 10:49:14,000
Booger, Healeth, Surf4r, Ruben, Albert Lele, SlashMac.

12253
10:49:15,520 --> 10:49:16,980
Who else played with us?

12254
10:49:17,240 --> 10:49:20,180
The Rugsby Chan guy that hopped on.

12255
10:49:20,460 --> 10:49:20,800
SK.

12256
10:49:22,160 --> 10:49:23,120
Who else?

12257
10:49:24,820 --> 10:49:27,160
Shoutout to Tony Flora, the man.

12258
10:49:28,560 --> 10:49:28,980
Lau.

12259
10:49:29,400 --> 10:49:31,760
Oh my god, Lau climbed so much.

12260
10:49:31,860 --> 10:49:32,620
How the fuck?

12261
10:49:32,840 --> 10:49:33,720
Look at this guy.

12262
10:49:34,700 --> 10:49:36,060
Oh my god.

12263
10:49:37,140 --> 10:49:39,920
I'm sorry for exposing you, Lau.

12264
10:49:40,460 --> 10:49:42,880
In the morning he was 350.

12265
10:49:43,380 --> 10:49:45,560
In the morning he was 300.

12266
10:49:45,920 --> 10:49:46,920
I'm sorry, Lau.

12267
10:49:47,340 --> 10:49:48,380
What happened?

12268
10:49:48,700 --> 10:49:49,420
Oh.

12269
10:49:51,320 --> 10:49:53,380
I'm so sorry, buddy.

12270
10:49:53,960 --> 10:49:56,460
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

12271
10:49:57,140 --> 10:49:57,440
Alright.

12272
10:49:58,180 --> 10:49:59,280
Oh my god.

12273
10:49:59,280 --> 10:50:04,160
And shoutout to all the children in Roblox that I beat up to achieve this goal.

12274
10:50:04,460 --> 10:50:05,440
We did it, guys.

12275
10:50:05,760 --> 10:50:06,460
We're freed.

12276
10:50:07,240 --> 10:50:09,300
We did it, everybody.

12277
10:50:09,800 --> 10:50:12,040
We fucking did it.

12278
10:50:13,020 --> 10:50:14,240
We're free.

12279
10:50:15,060 --> 10:50:16,580
We've made it.

12280
10:50:17,280 --> 10:50:21,820
It only took us one week of hard grinding.

12281
10:50:21,960 --> 10:50:24,740
I can see my family on YouTube again.

12282
10:50:26,200 --> 10:50:29,140
Until the cutoff fucks us up.

12283
10:50:29,760 --> 10:50:37,200
See you guys in two days when I find out that the cutoff is like 279.

12284
10:50:37,800 --> 10:50:39,120
Or 269.

12285
10:50:40,520 --> 10:50:43,340
So I'll see you guys in two days if that happens.

12286
10:50:43,860 --> 10:50:44,640
Anyway, guys.

12287
10:50:44,740 --> 10:50:45,920
As always, everybody.

12288
10:50:46,260 --> 10:50:47,360
Stay hydrated.

12289
10:50:48,440 --> 10:50:51,860
Please stream not Marvel for this stream.

12290
10:50:57,040 --> 10:50:57,540
GG's.

12291
10:50:57,760 --> 10:50:58,620
Get rekt.

12292
10:51:01,920 --> 10:51:02,880
Anyway, guys.

12293
10:51:04,080 --> 10:51:05,340
As always, everybody.

12294
10:51:05,580 --> 10:51:06,460
Stay hydrated.

12295
10:51:07,420 --> 10:51:08,980
Oh yeah, before we go.

12296
10:51:09,200 --> 10:51:10,520
It's time to do the prediction.

12297
10:51:11,140 --> 10:51:12,260
They did it.

12298
10:51:12,340 --> 10:51:13,100
They stuck out.

12299
10:51:14,280 --> 10:51:16,020
They stuck out to the end.

12300
10:51:16,580 --> 10:51:17,080
Prediction.

12301
10:51:17,240 --> 10:51:18,060
How do I do this?

12302
10:51:18,740 --> 10:51:21,000
They are in it to the top 500.

12303
10:51:21,260 --> 10:51:21,920
Oh my god.

12304
10:51:21,920 --> 10:51:24,360
44% of you did not believe.

12305
10:51:27,420 --> 10:51:30,420
44% of you did not believe.

12306
10:51:30,560 --> 10:51:31,980
Guys, look at that.

12307
10:51:33,940 --> 10:51:35,340
Look at that.

12308
10:51:35,440 --> 10:51:36,800
Let's go, believers.

12309
10:51:37,420 --> 10:51:39,220
Let's fucking go.

12310
10:51:42,900 --> 10:51:44,260
It's payday.

12311
10:51:44,960 --> 10:51:46,640
44% of you are gonna go bankrupt.

12312
10:51:47,000 --> 10:51:48,180
But the rest...

12313
10:51:48,180 --> 10:51:49,100
You guys got it.

12314
10:51:49,280 --> 10:51:50,120
You got the money.

12315
10:51:50,120 --> 10:51:50,840
Alrighty.

12316
10:51:51,020 --> 10:51:51,880
Thank you for the Twitch Prime.

12317
10:51:52,000 --> 10:51:52,160
Thank you.

12318
10:51:52,500 --> 10:51:52,720
Thank you.

12319
10:51:52,740 --> 10:51:54,260
Thank you for the 100 bitties.

12320
10:51:54,420 --> 10:51:54,720
Thank you.

12321
10:51:54,720 --> 10:51:55,320
Thank you.

12322
10:51:55,400 --> 10:51:56,140
We did...

12323
10:51:56,140 --> 10:51:58,460
Please follow all the people that helped out.

12324
10:51:58,760 --> 10:52:00,100
Exclamation point squad.

12325
10:52:01,000 --> 10:52:03,360
To see all the gamers that...

12326
10:52:03,360 --> 10:52:04,720
Helped out on the grind.

12327
10:52:06,340 --> 10:52:07,960
I will say...

12328
10:52:07,960 --> 10:52:09,280
Like I said.

12329
10:52:09,340 --> 10:52:11,200
Thanks for coming to this journey.

12330
10:52:11,800 --> 10:52:15,140
It was a very fucking long journey.

12331
10:52:15,620 --> 10:52:18,900
It was incredibly long.

12332
10:52:18,900 --> 10:52:22,540
One week plus of just rivals.

12333
10:52:23,440 --> 10:52:25,980
We played so much.

12334
10:52:26,620 --> 10:52:27,680
Oh my god.

12335
10:52:28,100 --> 10:52:31,060
And it was honestly an incredible...

12336
10:52:31,060 --> 10:52:31,960
The last...

12337
10:52:31,960 --> 10:52:36,940
I just can't believe that was the last game that got us the secure win.

12338
10:52:37,820 --> 10:52:39,120
But anyway, guys.

12339
10:52:39,460 --> 10:52:40,400
Thank you all for watching.

12340
10:52:40,720 --> 10:52:42,400
You've all been there for so long.

12341
10:52:43,040 --> 10:52:45,960
You all stuck out for 11 hours of this.

12342
10:52:46,160 --> 10:52:47,500
For the final climb.

12343
10:52:49,920 --> 10:52:51,520
Unless we come back in two days.

12344
10:52:51,580 --> 10:52:51,940
We'll see.

12345
10:52:52,300 --> 10:52:54,280
I'll see what it's going to be like in two days.

12346
10:52:54,560 --> 10:52:55,460
But as always, everybody.

12347
10:52:55,900 --> 10:52:56,740
If you are new here.

12348
10:52:56,880 --> 10:52:57,720
My name is Doki Bird.

12349
10:52:57,980 --> 10:52:59,300
I usually stream on YouTube.

12350
10:52:59,880 --> 10:53:01,500
So please check me out on YouTube.

12351
10:53:01,660 --> 10:53:03,540
If you want more of my content.

12352
10:53:03,660 --> 10:53:04,360
If you like my content.

12353
10:53:04,680 --> 10:53:06,800
I'm going to try and stream on Twitch at least once a week.

12354
10:53:07,280 --> 10:53:08,380
Or once every other week.

12355
10:53:08,780 --> 10:53:10,780
Because I want to try and grow my Twitch audience too.

12356
10:53:12,560 --> 10:53:14,920
But my main platform is YouTube.

12357
10:53:15,160 --> 10:53:16,220
So please check me out on YouTube.

12358
10:53:16,220 --> 10:53:18,740
If you want to know when I'm going to go live on Twitch.

12359
10:53:18,880 --> 10:53:20,080
Please follow me on Twitter.

12360
10:53:20,340 --> 10:53:25,460
Because I usually tweet out when I'm going to be live on Twitter.

12361
10:53:25,780 --> 10:53:27,000
So exclamation point Twitter.

12362
10:53:27,400 --> 10:53:29,100
Exclamation point YouTube.

12363
10:53:29,220 --> 10:53:29,900
Or socials.

12364
10:53:29,920 --> 10:53:32,120
You can see where my social media stuff is.

12365
10:53:33,200 --> 10:53:37,340
If you want to support me by other means.

12366
10:53:37,460 --> 10:53:38,240
I have merch.

12367
10:53:39,800 --> 10:53:43,460
Merch and custom PC cases.

12368
10:53:44,180 --> 10:53:44,940
I have an Android.

12369
10:53:44,940 --> 10:53:46,840
If you're new here and you didn't know about it.

12370
10:53:46,960 --> 10:53:49,360
Yeah, I do have an Android.

12371
10:53:49,660 --> 10:53:50,360
Let's see.

12372
10:53:50,480 --> 10:53:51,140
Where is it?

12373
10:53:51,200 --> 10:53:52,960
Let me grab the Nendoroid real quick.

12374
10:53:54,080 --> 10:53:56,540
I always have to swap between the two.

12375
10:53:57,000 --> 10:53:58,580
Let me grab the Nendoroids for this.

12376
10:53:59,040 --> 10:54:00,140
Exclamation point Nendoroid.

12377
10:54:00,240 --> 10:54:02,240
It would mean a lot if you pre-order it.

12378
10:54:02,440 --> 10:54:07,200
Because it lets me have a chance to get a second Nendoroid.

12379
10:54:07,280 --> 10:54:08,260
With my other design.

12380
10:54:08,720 --> 10:54:09,400
So yeah.

12381
10:54:09,580 --> 10:54:10,840
You have a Nendoroid.

12382
10:54:10,960 --> 10:54:12,380
They're planning on restocking it.

12383
10:54:12,420 --> 10:54:13,580
Apparently from what I'm told.

12384
10:54:13,580 --> 10:54:17,040
But for now, you can get the wall scroll.

12385
10:54:17,500 --> 10:54:18,500
The desk mat.

12386
10:54:18,680 --> 10:54:19,100
And everything.

12387
10:54:19,280 --> 10:54:19,740
The charm.

12388
10:54:20,140 --> 10:54:20,940
I do have a Nendoroid.

12389
10:54:21,000 --> 10:54:22,260
Exclamation point Nendoroid.

12390
10:54:22,460 --> 10:54:23,800
If you want to pre-order my figure.

12391
10:54:26,160 --> 10:54:27,040
What else?

12392
10:54:27,620 --> 10:54:29,200
I have a gamer subs code.

12393
10:54:29,360 --> 10:54:31,000
Doki Bird for 10% off.

12394
10:54:31,100 --> 10:54:31,780
And that's everything.

12395
10:54:31,900 --> 10:54:32,720
I think that's everything.

12396
10:54:33,740 --> 10:54:34,680
I can share.

12397
10:54:35,260 --> 10:54:38,860
But yes, please support and follow all the people that played with me.

12398
10:54:39,540 --> 10:54:40,700
Exclamation point squad.

12399
10:54:40,800 --> 10:54:42,200
They stuck it out for 10 hours.

12400
10:54:42,200 --> 10:54:43,320
Especially Gomez.

12401
10:54:43,480 --> 10:54:45,680
Who fucking stuck it out all the way to the end.

12402
10:54:45,800 --> 10:54:46,880
Like he played 10 hours.

12403
10:54:47,160 --> 10:54:50,940
He had to go through 10 hours of my support play.

12404
10:54:52,800 --> 10:54:55,720
I was definitely not playing at my best today.

12405
10:54:56,160 --> 10:54:57,880
So I really appreciate it.

12406
10:54:58,020 --> 10:54:58,540
Especially, you know.

12407
10:54:58,620 --> 10:54:59,420
Shout out to Kurova.

12408
10:55:04,220 --> 10:55:06,280
Because he's a better support player.

12409
10:55:06,640 --> 10:55:08,620
So like, I know that feeling.

12410
10:55:12,200 --> 10:55:17,080
Shout out to his mental for getting through 8 hours of that.

12411
10:55:20,010 --> 10:55:21,880
Our chemistry was so off.

12412
10:55:22,240 --> 10:55:23,100
And like, I don't know.

12413
10:55:23,240 --> 10:55:24,780
I felt really bad.

12414
10:55:28,220 --> 10:55:33,280
And the fact that when he played with me, Adam was always banned.

12415
10:55:36,010 --> 10:55:36,780
I'm sorry.

12416
10:55:38,360 --> 10:55:42,400
I'm sorry that people banned your Adam.

12417
10:55:43,620 --> 10:55:45,580
99% of those games.

12418
10:55:45,780 --> 10:55:47,100
I'm so sorry.

12419
10:55:51,560 --> 10:55:53,700
And shout out to Roblox Squid Game.

12420
10:55:54,160 --> 10:55:56,000
For letting me win.

12421
10:55:57,560 --> 10:55:58,520
Anyway guys.

12422
10:55:59,760 --> 10:56:00,800
As always, everybody.

12423
10:56:01,360 --> 10:56:02,180
Stay hydrated.

12424
10:56:02,420 --> 10:56:03,020
Posture check.

12425
10:56:03,100 --> 10:56:04,620
Get up and run around to get that blood flowing.

12426
10:56:04,760 --> 10:56:05,580
And if you stay up for me.

12427
10:56:05,580 --> 10:56:07,700
Also shout out to Mace for getting all this organized.

12428
10:56:11,120 --> 10:56:12,880
I'm sorry for...

12429
10:56:12,880 --> 10:56:14,440
I'm sorry that you crashed out.

12430
10:56:14,540 --> 10:56:16,400
I'm really sorry my games caused that.

12431
10:56:16,900 --> 10:56:18,520
I'm really sorry.

12432
10:56:22,740 --> 10:56:25,140
He organized the entire stack.

12433
10:56:26,460 --> 10:56:27,500
Stuff happened.

12434
10:56:27,620 --> 10:56:29,440
Those games were very rough, guys.

12435
10:56:29,560 --> 10:56:31,320
Those games were incredibly rough.

12436
10:56:31,680 --> 10:56:32,100
Anyway guys.

12437
10:56:32,140 --> 10:56:32,720
As always, everybody.

12438
10:56:32,840 --> 10:56:33,380
Stay hydrated.

12439
10:56:33,380 --> 10:56:33,980
Posture check.

12440
10:56:34,060 --> 10:56:35,160
Get up and run around to get that blood flowing.

12441
10:56:35,300 --> 10:56:35,900
And if you stay up for me.

12442
10:56:36,040 --> 10:56:36,660
Head to bed.

12443
10:56:36,720 --> 10:56:37,980
Cause you deserve it.

12444
10:56:38,100 --> 10:56:39,340
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

12445
10:56:39,500 --> 10:56:40,120
Bye, guys.

12446
10:56:40,560 --> 10:56:40,880
Bye.

12447
10:56:42,700 --> 10:56:43,020
Woah.

12448
10:56:43,680 --> 10:56:44,220
Oh, sorry.

12449
10:56:44,380 --> 10:56:45,380
He wants walkies now.

12450
10:56:45,800 --> 10:56:46,020
Oh, yeah.

12451
10:56:46,040 --> 10:56:46,280
But here.

12452
10:56:46,360 --> 10:56:47,180
Take a screenshot of this.

12453
10:56:47,500 --> 10:56:47,820
Woah.

12454
10:56:48,400 --> 10:56:49,000
Look at that.

12455
10:56:49,260 --> 10:56:49,580
Woah.

12456
10:56:49,900 --> 10:56:50,100
Sorry.

12457
10:56:50,160 --> 10:56:50,980
He wants walkies.

12458
10:56:51,100 --> 10:56:52,140
I'll see you guys.

12459
10:56:52,220 --> 10:56:52,480
Bye.
