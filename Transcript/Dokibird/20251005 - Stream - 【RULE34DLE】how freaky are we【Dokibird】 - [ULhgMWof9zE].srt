1
00:01:54,010 --> 00:02:24,950
Vince said the most cursed thing was cursing so far today to me yeah all right would you like to share in the class what did he just said to me before we swap the screen what do you like I said I hope Carfield is good and then I said don't fuck the cat and would you like to elaborate what you said right after is having a field.

2
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,290
He's getting real excited.

3
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:36,510
He's getting any Jay Dawson's in chat looking forward to Garfield showing up.

4
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,410
All the contributions to the site is him.

5
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:48,830
He's like 99% of the rule 34 and then the 1% is AI.

6
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,410
Hello everybody.

7
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:56,070
Hi.

8
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,210
Hello.

9
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,970
Welcome to Rule 34.

10
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,370
So before...

11
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,350
Oh wait, what you're gonna say.

12
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,310
No, you go.

13
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:04,650
You go.

14
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,110
No, no, no.

15
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,010
You go first.

16
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:13,890
I was gonna say, okay, nobody is gonna believe me when I say this, but I don't think I've been on the Rule 34 website before.

17
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:17,010
Yeah, because she has other sites that she needs.

18
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:18,990
I go on Dom Boru.

19
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,370
The weak equivalent of her.

20
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,970
It's a little...

21
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,630
The site is full of animators.

22
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,910
Okay, it doesn't make it any better than all humans.

23
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:34,590
You just specifically look for like rule 34 of anime characters.

24
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:38,710
You're like trying to be more specific to weeding out the non-weeb shit.

25
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:42,890
Like, yeah, I mean, it's not so easy to check.

26
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,130
Isn't it more degenerate than rule 34?

27
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,930
Because they have more tags in it.

28
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:49,670
And they don't know.

29
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,750
I've never been on rule 34.

30
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:55,610
They look into like, they look into like all like the Asian websites.

31
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:27,510
too because rule 34 mostly look at the western side so like you know they dig deep yourself on donboru no did you that don't i'm gonna look you up right now donkey bird i bet you saw something something freaky is there yeah how freaky how freaky let's see okay it's really funny because Let's see your tags.

32
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,010
The first one is indie virtual youtuber and the second one is gamers

33
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:59,430
So I knew mint would be the perfect duo For this stream because she is like I said freak phantom She would have the knowledge the knowledge for this and for so um wait.

34
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:04,990
Yeah, you gotta tell me tell you what Go ahead No, you go first.

35
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:20,850
Okay, okay, so, so when we were talking about rule 34 dope, she thought we were actually gonna look at real porn and anti on my channel.

36
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:25,370
And she was like, oh, it's on Jokey's channel, so I don't have to worry about it.

37
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:29,430
And like, yeah, she's risking her own channel.

38
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,830
I thought you were gonna have like a crazy sensor ready or something.

39
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:39,950
like, did you not open, by the way, we arranged this collab like, what, a week and a half ago?

40
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:45,150
And I was like, you did not look at the website at all for a week and a half?

41
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,690
You played this.

42
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:47,030
What?

43
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:47,730
What game?

44
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,050
What's the what's the game?

45
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:49,890
What game?

46
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:51,710
Honey Pop!

47
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:52,730
You played that.

48
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,190
I played it on Steam!

49
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:55,990
That's the censored version!

50
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,950
It's a censored, I know!

51
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,290
Oh, what do you mean?

52
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,070
What do you mean it's not censored?

53
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,310
What do you mean?

54
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,490
What do you mean?

55
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,710
Oh, you've seen a lot more.

56
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:13,650
Oh, you seem to know a lot of what's on that phone.

57
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:14,170
You'll see.

58
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,650
You'll check out what's on my phone, right?

59
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,930
It was not censored.

60
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,670
I played the Steam censored version.

61
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:30,090
I don't know what you're talking about.

62
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,230
But yeah, she thought we were actually going to look at...

63
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:37,610
We're actually going to look at real Hentai important on my channel.

64
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:42,230
She was very disappointed when she found out it's just Wordle with rule 34.

65
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,810
This is not even Wordle though.

66
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,870
It's just pick the character.

67
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:49,950
It's higher.

68
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:55,850
Okay, so for those who don't know, it's higher or lower, but with rule 34 tags.

69
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:00,550
So so we're given two options here right now.

70
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:03,430
Sailor Jupiter or Fox McLeod.

71
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:30,870
we have to decide which which has more porn in the their tags i like how also doki was like oh you are you are equipped for the stream because you collect dojin oh yeah i was like you actually own r18 like hentai and dojin's i own hentai yeah you look like you own

72
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,990
Oh, my dog agrees too.

73
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:39,310
Yeah, that's that freak right there.

74
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,330
That's her.

75
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,230
I forgot.

76
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,930
I need to feed him real quick.

77
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,370
You can all be right back.

78
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:50,450
That's why he's barking.

79
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,630
Dad agrees.

80
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:58,930
Wait, guys, Doki said that she owns one R18 Dojin.

81
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:02,510
Only one, which is unheard of for me.

82
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,210
I have a whole book show.

83
00:08:04,230 --> 00:09:50,450
full of thin books but does anyone know what she owns what is it what is it okay what what were you asking my chat without my consent huh is it okay i'm gonna guess is it is it robot themed no damn okay so yeah i told her i own one dogen and only one because it was a pair and I was so desperate for any type yeah it was a it was a rare pair and I was so desperate to consume any content of this of this pairing because there was like there was actually like practically none except for like one to two very overzealous yes I was a I was an ex Fujo so there was a really dark times for me but i was sonic what would it be sonic i'm just wondering what i had a very dark history with that with with male x mxm bl uh shipping and there was one rare pair that i could never get enough content of because it was so rare and such a obscure fandom and there was only like one to two i think like japanese artists that would draw this pairing and i would buy every i would like i even to the point where i

84
00:09:50,450 --> 00:10:54,790
don't know like were you a tumblr user back then or no no okay so back down tumblr these artists they'll have like alternate like r18 art blogs and you have to find their password and everything in their blogs and like because it's like hiddenly locked in behind a r18 tumblr blog and then you got to find the so yeah and then you have to find the r8 like the password in their regular art blog because it'll be hidden in there and they'll like make it like invisible text and everything so you have to do like detective mystery work to to access the porn like what why are they gatekeeping why are they gatekeeping and then so so it was like my only way to consume to consume my rare pair so it's it's the one dogen i own the i purchased like that i purchased is the three kingdoms um it's from it's it's i didn't see war here No!

85
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:56,050
What?

86
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,450
He don't understand.

87
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:11,640
He's just a one, one pairing that kind of seaworthy.

88
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,600
Because like, okay,

89
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:28,200
I- Why would you, why would you say his love?

90
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,020
Oh, did I hit the nail on the head?

91
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,920
No, no, it's not.

92
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,360
It's a, it's a rare pair.

93
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:37,760
Oh, sorry, sorry.

94
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:47,200
Look, I will say, look, if they had enough content, I would never have stooped.

95
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:52,260
I would never have, like, actually bought the Doge in, but, like, I was desperate.

96
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:59,580
Like, you don't even see it, barely see any even fanfictions of, in general, Dynasty Warriors pairing still.

97
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:04,420
Like, you don't even see, like, a lot of fanfictions about it.

98
00:12:04,720 --> 00:13:44,150
So, like, if I could, because I was a fan of, you know, other characters, you know, you know that would be a you know that would like that would make my food your side happy but this particular fandom it made me sad so i had to it made me really sad and i was starving i was so i was so hungry did you write fanfics of them because they had nothing i i think i like did it i okay okay so you know do you remember live journal oh so in live journal they would host these things called those anonymous kink fan fiction or so i don't remember what it called do you remember those i don't remember what they're called i hope that they would people would request like there to be like we're so starving you post anonymously and you have to post anonymously you can post anonymously I'll be like looking for this Harry doing this and the writers would like break oh yeah the cake memes yeah the cake memes that was what they're called look it was I was very deep into it because like I was so hungry.

99
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,110
I Needed an itch that needed to be scratched.

100
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:59,170
Okay So I've learned something I was so desperate because it was all my other favorite ships I was fine.

101
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,170
I was satisfied.

102
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:10,890
There's so much iron of it I can consume it and everything but this one this one was where I had to cross the line and actually own Do you still have it?

103
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,830
I do, I found it like, like, I think like a couple of months ago.

104
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:15,930
And I was like, oh my God.

105
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:16,870
Yeah.

106
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,490
So the rare pair, I don't even know.

107
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:21,570
I don't think you know the characters.

108
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:22,450
That's how rare they are.

109
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:25,950
Cause they only show up for, in the newer games.

110
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:31,010
And like, cause it was like, cause it was like, they were like, they hated each other.

111
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:34,050
And I'm like, oh my God, enemies to lovers.

112
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:37,290
Oh no, wait, you're describing what I do.

113
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:38,830

Okay, all right, so...

146
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:04,050
We talked about this a little bit.

147
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:04,850
There's no BGM.

148
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,490
I don't even know if we should have a...

149
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,250
Should we have a BGM for this?

150
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,390
I don't even...

151
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,790
Maybe some, like, pee-pee music or some pee-pee...

152
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,230
What's this one in the background?

153
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:17,090
I don't even know.

154
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,550
Okay, let me grab some music real quick, guys.

156
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,910
Yeah, like a saxophone, like a sexy BGM.

157
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:25,830
Oh, yeah.

158
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:26,750
Okay, wait.

159
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,170
Let's see.

160
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,410
Saxophone copyright free.

161
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:37,890
All right, saxophone music, no copyright.

162
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,350
You like jazz?

163
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:41,770
Yeah.

164
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:43,350
All right.

165
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:48,690
Oh...

166
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:49,310
They can't...

167
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,590
Okay, wait, let me...

168
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:55,170
Let me make it so they can hear the chads real quick.

169
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,810
Yeah, you like that, but you don't like it.

170
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,190
Yeah, yeah, keep that one, keep that one.

171
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,010
They weren't able to hear it earlier, so they don't worry.

172
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,110
It's doing something for me.

173
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:07,930
Ooh!

174
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:08,530
Whoa!

175
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:09,890
Oh!

176
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:13,370
Oh!

177
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,470

Oh, yeah.

00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:37,450
So we had a little discussion about this a bit before the stream started.

184
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:41,210
Wait, what if we just put seabat on repeat?

185
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:42,750

186
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,370

00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,440
You and I are working here today Yeah.

191
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,180
But I don't know.

192
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,200
Is it sexy talk?

193
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:51,820
Is it?

194
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,800
What is this?

195
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:02,800
Don't turn it up so I guess like don't turn it up too much guys.

196
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,800
All right, out of this.

197
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:11,000
I just

198
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,200
realized it's literally just one chord and they repeat.

199
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,020
It is just one thing and they repeat.

200
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,000
No thoughts, just vibe.

201
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,580
Alright, is that good enough audio testing sound, guys?

202
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:02,020
We're just vibing the music now.

203
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:03,460
All right.

204
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,220
I think it's Fox McLeod.

205
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,040
I think it's Fox.

206
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,800
I honestly think so too.

207
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:15,160
Like, we talked about it before because we're like, even though, like, yeah, Sailor Jupiter has been around for a while.

208
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,380
So has Fox, though.

209
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,340
So has Fox, yeah.

210
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,580
And also, like, furries love their porn.

211
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,940
It's Fox for sure.

212
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:25,760
Wait, wait, wait.

213
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,180
Before we starve, what do you think our streak is going to be?

214
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,680
Our streak, I would be surprised if we get to 10.

215
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:31,800
My streak.

216
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,780
I think 10 is a good goal.

217
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,100
Yeah, 10 is a good goal.

218
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,900
Because, like, the furthest I got to was, like, three.

219
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,100
That was the furthest I got to.

220
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:41,980
But, yeah.

221
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:42,620
Fox.

222
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,440
Oh, my God.

223
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,620
That's a lot.

224
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,520
What the hell is she?

225
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,280
She's from Bleach.

226
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,280
She's, like, the main girl in Bleach, right?

227
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,060
Is she the main girl in Bleach?

228
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,040
Who is she?

229
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,040
It's Fox.

230
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,140
I still think it's Fox.

231
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,040
I still think it's Fox.

232
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:54,740
fox is gonna go on for a while until we get to like genshin or some shit if if sailor jupiter only had like a thousand i still think it's fox yeah also i think if i think if it was like sailor moon then i would believe she would have a fighting chance but like yeah yeah yeah yeah also but orihime has big boobies a majority of anime women have big boobs though yeah doesn't mean like you know like sometimes you know if we get over saturated it with big boobs like sometimes you can get bored of that you know that's why variety is nice so not not not sometimes you want a fox yeah sometimes you yeah sometimes you know including more spice in your life maybe a fox ain't too bad people are saying copium oh oh that's close That was close though.

233
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,900
That was really close.

234
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,680
What if...

235
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,580
What is Mushoku Tensei?

236
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,100
Isn't that... That's um...

237
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,700
It's a entire franchise though.

238
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,280
The dungeon.

239
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,260
That's uh...

240
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:04,480
Mechi.

241
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,420
Wait, isn't that dungeon?

242
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,020
Okay, there's a lot of Isakai shit.

243
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:11,780
I don't...

244
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,000
I don't... I think it's...

245
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,860
Is that a whole franchise though?

246
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,640
Yeah, but like what is that though?

247
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,880
To be fair, I don't know a lot, but...

248
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,300
Oh, it's not dungeon Mechi.

249
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,100
I'm a stupid.

250
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,400
Yeah, it's really said Mushoku...

251
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,680
Tensei, not Dungeon Meshie.

252
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:27,940
What?

253
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,360
Sorry, I'm jet lagged.

254
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,760
The title is right here.

255
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,180
What do you...

256
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,540
I don't know.

257
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,680
I was just looking at the picture.

258
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,240
Someone said it's the Isakai.

259
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,040
It's a fairly new...

260
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,160
It's the Isakai?

261
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,720
Oh, Mint doesn't even know it.

262
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,460

263
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,060
Weep card.

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,500

283
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:19,210
He closed.

284
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:25,590
Oopsie.

285
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,010
Oh.

286
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:27,150

290
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,560
So is Star versus forces of evil to be fair?

291
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:15,850
No!

292
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:17,990
Oh, no!

293
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:20,470
No, no.

294
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:21,510
Oh.

295
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:22,410
I know.

296
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:24,390
Like, the parents may be.

297
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,590
Okay, so, okay.

298
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:29,250
Because it's the entire series.

299
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,050
I'm just a five-width series.

300
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:33,350
Nothing else, but nothing else.

301
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:36,550
I would say that Blue is a very...

302
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,210
That's horrifying.

303
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,050
That's a horrifying...

304
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:41,070
That is so...

305
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:41,910
Yeah, there's...

306
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:42,310
No!

307
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:47,710
We have to make a choice that is higher than lower.

308
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:49,490
You know what, man?

309
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:52,170
Who do you think has more rule 34?

310
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,390
Don't put this on me!

311
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:56,270
Who do you think has more rule 34?

312
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:57,530
I don't know, man!

313
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:58,350
I don't know!

314
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,150
I don't know either!

315
00:26:59,390 --> 00:26:59,770
I don't know!

316
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:02,210
What choice should we make?

317
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:07,450
I think maybe in times of hardship we go with the furry buff.

318
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:08,690
That's true.

319
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:16,930
No matter what the property is All things point to furry

320
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:42,070
Always bet on furry and Pokemon Like they say There's no rules against Pokemon Batman And apparently the Bluey 2 There's no rules I was like, if there's no laws, it gets bluey, Batman.

321
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:46,670
Oh, at least it's not showing us what's in there.

322
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:47,350
There you go.

323
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:49,290
3,000.

324
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:50,870
I hope it's...

325
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:54,970
Okay.

326
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:58,690
I will assume...

327
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:02,770
Okay, I think we should quit.

328
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:06,670
It's bluey, we're just going to quit.

329
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,970
Okay, if bluey...

330
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:18,090
If Bluey has more Rule 34 than Okayu, then I would be very sad.

331
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:21,990
Oh, we're going to lose our streak.

332
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:24,210
You're going to pick Bluey?

333
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:26,530
You're still going to pick Bluey!

334
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:31,830
I think Okayu because I think...

335
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:34,030
Well, actually, I don't know how many people use this site.

336
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:35,010
Like, how many people are...

337
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:35,630
This...

338
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,310
How active is Rule 34?

339
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,750
Yeah, we removed AI.

340
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:39,990
Rule 34, right?

341
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:40,950
Yeah, it's not Danburu.

342
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:42,110
It's Danburi.

343
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:43,970
What's it called?

344
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:44,130
Yeah.

345
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,210
Oh, Danburu.

346
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:45,970
Danburu.

347
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:46,970
It's not Danburu.

348
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,930
It's Rule 34.

349
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,250
We have- I don't know how active this site is.

350
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:55,090
It's not Western fans to overpower Bluey.

351
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:57,230
Oh, apparently it's a very Western site.

352
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,130
Oh, God.

353
00:28:58,550 --> 00:28:59,070
Oh.

354
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:01,770
I...

355
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:06,850
Are you really gonna continue on with Bluey this year?

356
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:13,090
Do you have faith in the power of VTubers?

357
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:15,270
Or do you think the furries win?

358
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,150
I'm going to let you pick this one.

359
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,050
Wait, why did I pick this one?

360
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,830
I picked the last one.

361
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:23,030
No, I also agreed with you.

362
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:23,650
I began.

363
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:26,690
So it's your turn to make the pick and I'll agree with you.

364
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:31,990
You're the representative for VTubers.

365
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,190
Okay, let's go with Okayu.

366
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:34,150
Let's have hope.

367
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,190
We're already five anyway, so.

368
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:40,050
I told you.

369
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:41,410
What do you mean I told you?

370
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:44,370
I said you make the choice and I'll agree with whatever.

371
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,930
Because I didn't want to believe.

372
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:46,890
Yeah, you're a coward.

373
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:48,430
You're a coward, man.

374
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:49,570
You're a coward.

375
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,310
You couldn't pick Bluey.

376
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:54,010
You knew in your heart it was Bluey.

377
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:56,910
It's over.

378
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:00,550
So it's like never bet against the furries.

379
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:03,110
Well, I didn't.

380
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:04,370
Let's see.

381
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,690
Well, we got halfway to what our goal was.

382
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,210
Yeah, yeah, we got halfway.

383
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:12,330
That's...

384
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,600
Um...

385
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:20,960
Okay.

386
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,100
Um...

387
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,560
Okay, look...

388
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,100
Mona is very popular, but so is...

389
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:27,880
But Miku...

390
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,300
Miku has been around longer.

391
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,680
Yeah, I say Miku.

392
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,300
But are they more strong...

393
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,500
Are they stronger than the power of Genshin, though?

394
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,900
I think Miku still, I think Miku.

395
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,480
You think so?

396
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,120
Miku, sweet?

397
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,440
Oh, yeah.

398
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,200
Oh, that's a lot.

399
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,940
I'm sorry, but...

400
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:50,280
I'm sorry, you're up against Meeku.

401
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,960
Why are all these weirdos going on?

402
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,440
Where did they all direct it?

403
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,060
They knew.

404
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:03,200
They're like, on Saturday, Doki and Min are going to rule 34, though.

405
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,560
And they changed the algorithm.

406
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,480
They changed the algorithm.

407
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,620
Because, like, when I was testing it up, I did not hit any VTubers.

408
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:16,880
And even though my longest stream was three, I did play like four times.

409
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:18,980
But this one's easy.

410
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:19,680
It's also Kanata.

411
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,140
Yeah, it should be.

412
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:22,940
112.

413
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,000
That's pretty good.

414
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,220
That's actually more than I thought.

415
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,440
Oh, wait.

416
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,060
The entire.

417
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:33,320
You think Kimei's going to win the entire franchise of My Hero Academia?

418
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,940
I think.

419
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,080
No.

420
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,080
Maybe not.

421
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,780
What's that one girl?

422
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,880
The girl that can flow?

423
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,220
I think she alone has.

424
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:46,620
Or no.

425
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:50,880
I think it's the, you know that guy, the perverted guy that everyone hates?

426
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,720
I think he has more than Hime.

427
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,040
Oh.

428
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,540
I think, you know, because I hate him.

429
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:02,780
Because, like, I think this also, it includes, like, even if he's, like, in the artwork, he's included in a tag.

430
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:03,480
You know?

431
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,100
True, true, true, true.

432
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,800
So that I won't be surprised if he's just in the corner watching.

433
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,060
Because they're always, like, they always do these type of...

434
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:09,160
Yeah, yeah.

435
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,520
He's always there.

436
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,280
He's always there.

437
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,180
I feel like, yeah, the great man, he's just be there in the crater.

438
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,940
Don't call him that.

439
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,500
What's his name?

440
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,200
I don't know.

441
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,340
Yeah, cameos count.

442
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,280
Okay, pick my hero.

443
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,100
I'm curious.

444
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,000
Whoa!

00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,260

446
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,320

00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,620

She's all covered up.

00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,560
You know, less is more.

453
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,220
Yeah, that's just P. Hematoh.

454

Oh, not Trish.

457
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,920
Oh, that's hard.

458
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:27,680
Because she doesn't.

I spent a thousand dollars to become the Duchess of Sealand.

478
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:06,740
Yeah.

479
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,000
It's the highest form of royalty other than queen.

480
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:13,620
And not, it's below queen.

481
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:22,780
Would you like some tea and biscuits, Mint, while we decide who has more Rule 34 posts between Tima No or Trish from Devil May Cry?

482
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,600
No, I would not like your tea and biscuits.

483
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,740
Don't fucking come close to me.

484
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:38,120
I'm gonna, you know, I feel because I play Devil May Cry, I must bet on Trish.

You want to bet on Trish?

00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:04,690
Is she like a filler character?

491
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:12,330
There's no way this filler character is gonna beat Sakura Yeah, yeah, yeah I was like, who even is she?

492
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,210
Animal Kill!

00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:39,540
I just searched Blue Archive and then I read it.

509
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:45,820
You're like, hmm, what are the new daily uploads for Blue Archive today?

510
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:46,920

511
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,320
What's the tag?

512
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,900
I read one with Slana and...

513
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,040
What were the numbers?

514
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,000
The numbers?

515
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,220
What were the numbers?

516
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,820
You know, the URL number.

517
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,580
The URL number?

518
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,240
I don't know.

519
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,700
I just look at the name.

520
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,640
What does that mean?

521
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,800
Nuclear launch code.

522
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,260
What were they?

523
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,120
There's a six-digit code, man.

524
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,140
What was six-digit?

525
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:20,900
I don't know.

526
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,780
There's a code.

527
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:22,960
What does that mean?

528
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,520
Then you weren't...

529
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,000
Then it wasn't a good dogein.

530
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,880
It's not a good dogein.

531
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:32,600
There was a second one I read, but I can't even remember what girl it was.

532
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:38,940
She is a fine appreciator of fine art.

533
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,160
I'm going to look it up.

534
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,960
You're going to look up the fortune.

535
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,940
If you're like fake a gooner, revoke your free card.

536
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,680
If you don't know the numbers.

537
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,340
Hey, what's the numbers?

538
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,600
There's literally nothing here.

539
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,080
Like the date of the morning.

540
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:58,620
Oh, it was, it was, oh my gosh.

541
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:01,720
Kisaki.

542
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:03,660
Is that the title?

543
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:30,020

545
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:46,890
You didn't hear it from me, okay?

546
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,190
Okay, there you go.

547
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:48,690
Whoa!

548
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:52,850
You didn't hear it from me.

549
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:57,370
Be very quiet.

550
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:01,330
No leaks.

551
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:02,710
No leaks.

552
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:03,750
It's good though.

553
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:04,490
It's pretty good.

554
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:09,010
I was saying...

555
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:09,850
Marnie.

556
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:12,970
I think Mako is not one of the...

557
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:13,790
Okay, Fox.

558
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:14,710
We already know.

559
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:15,190
Mako?

560
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:16,690
I think Mako.

561
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:18,470
Because it's just a also Vocaloid.

562
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,650
I think it's Fox.

563
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:23,250
I feel like if there's a furry...

564
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:24,390
Oh, I was looking at the wrong thing.

565
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:25,310
Okay, you're right.

566
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:25,590
Okay.

567
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:29,650
Yeah, I was gonna say, if it's a furry, I think the furry wins.

568
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:30,590
Yeah, it's Fox.

569
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:34,250
Yeah, he's been a long-term contender.

570
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:36,270
Who?

571
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:37,070
Yeah.

572
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:38,550
Oh, it's League of Legends.

573
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:40,990
So, like, only the depressed people would know.

574
00:42:44,310 --> 00:43:13,010
um actually i'm surprised that the toothpaste man has more than i was surprised you 2k i guess i guess there's a also like a bias for newer characters right oh because i was thinking like does he just like a self-insert maybe for the women maybe i think oh girl version there's a girl version of him So they included that,

575
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:13,390
too.

576
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:14,450
Okay, okay, okay.

577
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:19,070
Okay, is Diana a popular character in League?

578
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:20,810
Because she's not in Arcane.

579
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:22,730
It might be a League buff, though.

580
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:24,170
Like, it might be, you know.

581
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,580
Oh, Mike, I'm not going to read that super chat.

582
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,460
What did it say?

583
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,440
Look at the newest super chat.

584
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,220
Why would you say that?

585
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:38,100
Why would you say that?

586
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,460
They need to find joy in their life.

587
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,480
They look at Rule 30.

588
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:43,500
40.

589
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,540
I would just say that.

590
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:47,840
Okay.

591
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:49,060
Do it.

592
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:49,480
Do League.

593
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:50,180
Lock in.

594
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:50,800
League?

595
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,080
I don't even know who she is.

596
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:53,700
I don't know.

597
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:55,780
Maybe it is.

598
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,480
Do you know how many characters League has?

599
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,080
Do you know?

600
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,080
No.

601
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:02,100
It has like 100 plus characters in League alone.

602
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:02,520
What?

603
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:03,100
Yeah.

604
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:04,200
So there's no way.

605
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,000
There's no way.

606
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:08,900
It's like, you know, the fans are split, you know, into different.

607
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:09,920
Okay, then do Fire Emblem.

608
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,620
I feel like it'd be Fire Emblem.

609
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:19,100
there's at least two li clary characters there's 180 li characters yeah i knew i was like oh my gosh

610
00:44:31,280 --> 00:45:13,920
wait oh but that's totally yeah oh no it's toriel it's torio that's torio there's no never bet against the furries yeah yeah kenshin can only uh i still oh this was hard it's like boy love versus hentai i don't know i'm not and it's kona suva isn't that a really popular anime it is it is but she's not the most popular character so she's not oh so it has to be genshin then because he's popular i know he's popular right yeah i feel all the men are popular if i didn't know his number i would say darkness but i but 35 100 is pretty high.

611
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:17,800
Someone's like, darkness, 100%.

612
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:19,500
She is to me.

613
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,120
She's like, she's popular to me.

614
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:23,660
Okay.

615
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:24,640
I'm sorry.

616
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:25,880
You're coping right now.

617
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:28,760
Show me Megumene's numbers right now.

618
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,900
They were wrong.

619
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,240
Oh, but we got 13.

620
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,200
All right, let's get 20 now.

621
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:39,440
Okay, let's get 20.

622
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:42,160
She should be the...

623
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,840
Okay, I'm surprised she beat...

624
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:46,360
Because I thought he was very popular.

625
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:47,860
Yeah, I thought so.

626
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,620
Oh, no, wait.

627
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:51,180
But, oh, it's the franchise.

628
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,720
I was going to be like, oh, do you know?

629
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,060
All of the Gundams.

630
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:59,660
All of the Gundams versus Gene Altair.

631
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,300
I'm just curious, what is the number of the guy?

632
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,160
Like, what is...

633
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:07,120
In the entire franchise, we have one franchise taker down.

634
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:08,420
They do know how many.

635
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:08,940
I know.

636
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:10,220
Do you know how many Gundams?

637
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:13,580
Also, which for Mercury would that alone?

638
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:40,040
will probably know so yeah it's definitely Gundam there's no way oh my god oh it's just for the anime mobile suit Gundam the anime series I thought it was the entire Gundam I thought it was all of Gundam yeah if it was Jake the dog no wait why does Jake the dog look like you though

639
00:46:45,040 --> 00:47:02,260
and just because he's yellow not every yellow character looks like each other why does he look like he looks I am a bird he is a dog you're a cat bird right now you can be a dog bird too

640
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:16,540
I think it's Jake the dog really Jake the dog how do you I guess because he can shape-shift into anything you want.

641
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:17,720
It's adventure time.

642
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:18,540
Oh, yeah.

643
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,360
It is adventure time.

644
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:21,840
What?

645
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:25,620
Okay.

646
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,020
I would say...

647
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,860
It's the entire tailspin.

648
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:34,220
If it was the entire adventure time, I would think it would be adventure time to win.

649
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:34,920
But...

650
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,860
Well, who's uploading tailspin?

651
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:37,640
No, D.

652
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:42,400
Because, like...

653
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,560
Don't the...

654
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:43,940
What were you...

655
00:47:43,960 --> 00:48:45,340

They're very into Gadget.

657
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:48,300
Oh, wow.

658
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:50,440
This song is so depressing.

659
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:52,100
I...

660
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:56,240
All right, what's your... I think it's tailspin.

661
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,360
I think it's tailspin.

662
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,240
I think it's, like, deep.

663
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:02,020
I think they're in there.

664
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,960
I knew it.

665
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:04,920
I knew it.

666
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:07,600
Sans, Sans, hundred, sans.

667
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:08,900
Sans, undertail, baby.

668
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:16,200
Okay, I will... I told my chat this, so you can't be like, Oh my god, because I told I was also a consumer of Sands.

669
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:18,860
Sands?

670
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:19,900
Yes!

671
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:20,980
Wait, with who?

672
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:21,420
With who?

673
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:21,800
With who?

674
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:22,680
Like, I don't care.

675
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,440
He was a bicycle.

676
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:24,940
Sands, reader.

677
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:28,060
He was like, I don't care who.

678
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,160
It was just, as long as Sands was in there, I'm fine.

679
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,460
Because he was a bicycle.

680
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:36,720
You know, like, anyone can ride him.

681
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,000
Anyone can.

682
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:39,980
Hold on.

683
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,380
Bound him.

684
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,180
It has to be.

685
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:56,920
All right.

686
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:58,960
The Flintstones?

687
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:02,580
I think Sands would win.

688
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:03,300
I don't know.

689
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,120
I mean, we all rule 34.

690
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:07,040
No.

691
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,860
The Flintstones, I mean, maybe like, what's her name?

692
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:11,320
Wilma?

693
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:11,900
Wilma?

694
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:12,480
maybe.

695
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,740
I mean, there's like sexy Halloween costumes of Wilma.

696
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:16,760
There is.

697
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,300
Yeah, but is there sexy Halloween costumes of Sans?

698
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,520
Spirit Halloween, write that down.

699
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:27,220
Spirit Halloween, when will I get my...

700
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:33,700
When will we get our sexy Halloween costume of Sans Undertale?

701
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:35,200
Spirit Halloween.

702
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:39,520
I maybe, I don't know, the Flintstones, it's just, I don't know.

703
00:50:40,620 --> 00:51:09,200

00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:39,540
Whoopion?

708
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:40,080
Whoopion?

709
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:40,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

710
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,700
I had to commission her on DeviantArt.

711
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:46,460
So she's like, yeah, because she used to be on DeviantArt before she swapped to Twitter.

712
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:46,960
I remember.

713
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,660
And I got an email the other day being like, happy birthday.

714
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,760
I was like, oh, but yeah.

715
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,960
So everybody, that's why.

716
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,380
I'm getting, oh, I'm getting, oh.

717
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:01,220
Whoa, what are you getting right now?

718
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:03,620
Actually, like, a whole lot of normal stuff.

719
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,880
Who could have thought there were normal people on D-U-D-N-R?

720
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,620
Okay, a whole lot of AI.

721
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:10,640
Oh, yeah.

722
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:14,560
Yeah, I heard, like, D-D-N-R is, like, so rampant with that right now.

723
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:16,800
That's why we did exclude AI.

724
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,960
We removed the AI results.

725
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:19,840
All right.

726
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,200
I think it's Sans.

727
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,980
There's no way Flintstones would be.

728
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,880
I think it's like...

729
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:25,560
Go with Sanson.

730
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:27,460
Yeah, I was going to say, there's no way.

731
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:27,900
Yeah.

732
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:29,880
Who?

733
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:30,740
Oh, yeah.

734
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:34,320
It's like, it's life is...

735
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:59,400
strange but like i've never played that game before this one's hard because i what wait i i i don't i i flintstones i i don't think there's enough rule 34 are you oh my god there is a lot of rule 34 i am back close to why is there so many why is she's the main character why did you guys say that

736
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:35,200
oh ashley oh ashley ashley oh my god ashley ashley who is she actually i think she's like a sideish character a sideish okay yeah the caesar zeppelzi i think it's it could be mirajane i think maybe It might be here.

737
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:40,580
Yeah, because, like, there's not a lot of women to pair Caesar with, but it's mostly be a boy love thing.

738
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,100
And I don't know.

739
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:42,500
I don't know.

740
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:43,860
Because there's so many Jojos.

741
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:46,860
You would assume that the Jojos would be the one that compares.

742
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:49,240
Oh, oh my god, by it.

743
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:51,880
Barely, barely, barely.

744
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:53,820
The Caesar sweep.

745
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,360
Not a sweep.

746
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:00,020
He just crossed the line.

747
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:04,240
I think fighting game fans are really crazy.

748
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:05,400
So maybe Tao Kaka.

749
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:06,240
Tao Kaka?

750
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:07,980
Maybe.

751
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:08,600
Oh.

752
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:10,320
No, it wasn't.

753
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:12,740
I feel like Rio Zero fans would be crazy.

754
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:13,540
Oh, boy.

755
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:18,560
Okay, boyfriend's mostly used as a self-insert, though.

756
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:19,040
Yeah.

757
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,040
But like...

758
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,840
But it's Sephiroth, though.

759
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:25,500
Sephiroth, that's less than I thought it would be.

760
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:26,520
Honestly, true.

761
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:29,900
I feel like because like people would look at like the other girls more.

762
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,240
I think it's boyfriend.

763
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,160
Is it boyfriend?

764
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:35,720
Boyfriend, lock in.

765
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:42,830
Oh, this one's hard.

766
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:44,730
Oh, this one's really hard.

767
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:50,750
Oh.

768
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:50,910
Uh-oh.

769
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:52,530
Oh, this one's hard.

770
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:53,810
This one's hard.

771
00:54:55,550 --> 00:54:56,810
7K for boyfriend.

772
00:54:57,290 --> 00:54:57,570
I know.

773
00:54:57,870 --> 00:54:59,710
It's just like 7K.

774
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:04,230
Like how many self-inserts are that you have boyfriend?

775
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:12,010
But also, like, with Friday Night Funkin, they kind of just put that character in, like, other things.

776
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:15,830
So it could be, like, it could be, like, Samus, and he's in the background or something.

777
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:16,450
You know, like, that?

778
00:55:16,570 --> 00:55:17,590
Oh, that's true.

779
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:21,770
Yeah, you could just be watching, just like the other guy from My Hero Academia.

780
00:55:22,770 --> 00:55:23,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

781
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:26,810
I don't know here.

782
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:27,910
I don't know, because, like, the thing.

783
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:31,670
Oh, because Avatar is such a popular show, too.

784
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:32,450
It is.

785
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:35,330
Yeah, and Katara was, like, uh...

786
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:36,610
Katara's like a main character.

787
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:37,870
Yeah, she was like...

788
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:40,430
I mean, she married the avatar.

789
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:43,750
She literally married the avatar, so...

790
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:45,670
Oh, that makes her...

791
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:47,890
That technically makes her main...

792
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:50,730
Yeah, she was technically the main character by association.

793
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:52,670
She married.

794
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:54,210
Wait, did they actually get married?

795
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:55,730
Get married and have kids.

796
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:56,930
What do you mean?

797
00:55:57,230 --> 00:55:57,930
Wait, what?

798
00:55:58,070 --> 00:55:59,070
Did you not watch...

799
00:55:59,070 --> 00:56:00,630
Do you not know Legend of Korra?

800
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:02,410
Oh, that's her...

801
00:56:02,410 --> 00:56:03,350
That's their baby!

802
00:56:03,370 --> 00:56:04,630
No, that's not their baby!

803
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:09,330
No, that's not their baby.

804
00:56:09,710 --> 00:56:10,930
No, no, no.

805
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:12,890
She trained the baby.

806
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:16,710
He had three kids.

807
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:18,090
So they were...

808
00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:20,290
Oh,

809
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:26,060
wait.

810
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:27,980
So, Kora is not their baby.

811
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,540
No, Kora is not their baby.

812
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:33,280
Do you know how the avatar cycle works?

813
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:34,900
Do you know how?

814
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:36,600
Wait.

815
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:38,200
Wait, no, it doesn't.

816
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:45,020
When the avatar dies, he gets instantly reincarnated into someone else.

817
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:46,260
So he's dead?

818
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:47,380
Yes!

819
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:48,820
To have...

820
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:49,380
What do you think?

821
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,120
To have the two avatar?

822
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:58,400
I'm sorry to break it to you, but...

823
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,640
But Aang died.

824
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:00,640
I'm sorry.

825
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:03,320
I'm sorry he had the grief now.

826
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:06,760
Is Katara still alive?

827
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:08,840
Yes, she's still alive.

828
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:10,540
She's very old.

829
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,900
Did she kill him so that would be a new avatar?

830
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,800
She died of old age.

831
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:19,920
What do you mean?

832
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:21,660
Stop.

833
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,380
It's not his exploit.

834
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:32,230
To die.

835
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:34,270
We can't have two avatars.

836
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:37,630
So eventually, we will have a new avatar.

837
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:39,270
So he would have had to die.

838
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:40,290
He would.

839
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:44,430
Why did you think Katara didn't kill him?

840
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:48,050
So why would you think Katara would have killed Aang?

841
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:51,690
Because what if they needed someone with limber?

842
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:54,490
what because

843
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:29,420
he has dementia and we're like we gotta get him out we can't have him continue to be he's like we can't have him to continue to be an avatar he's a menace to society we gotta kill him like he's talking about the fire nation i don't know he's like the fire nation still is so evil we gotta get him out well that kind of sucks all three of their kids didn't become the avatar like what are they useless

844
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:43,850
in order for that to work he has to be like dying during conceivement if he's in the

845
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:52,620
middle of it then he can restart it's like a bee it's like a bee

846
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,600
I continue the bloodline.

847
00:58:58,620 --> 00:58:59,400
And then they die.

848
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,640
That's true.

849
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:02,980
That's true.

850
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:07,580
They were born, they were born to bang.

851
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,300
That was your purpose.

852
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:26,580
You're having a heart attack mid-session and to get you reincarnated in your wife's belly.

853
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:53,360
I've been getting these like short form like like episode series on TikTok recently yeah and one of them they're always it'll always show up in my timeline as like episode 16 or something like that and there's one where I don't know what's going on but the baby has magical powers and like talk to the dad and be like,

854
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:58,960
father, look, place your hand on mom's belly and I'll transfer the power to you.

855
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:03,020
What the fuck?

856
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,540
Did he do it?

857
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:14,140
Yeah, and then it like went to his brain and then they saved the father who had a heart attack.

858
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:15,600
And maybe...

859
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,320
Why did that save his father from the heart?

860
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:19,720
Because the baby transferred the magic.

861
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,340
She had spent the magic to stop.

862
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:22,960
Here, I'll send it to you.

863
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:27,120
So was he having a heart attack mid-touching the belly or something?

864
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:32,160
The father had, no, the grandpa had a heart attack, and the baby.

865
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:39,260
Oh, the baby was like, father, touch mommy's belly real quick, so I can save grandpa.

866
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,580
I'll send it to you right now.

903
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:49,320

01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,640
He's from San Francisco's Green family.

914
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:04,520
How do I hang on?

915
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:06,680
Dad, Charles really saved me.

916
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,820
Susan, you're still defending him?

917
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:11,000
Do you know how bad this is for the family?

918
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:14,580
Your grandpa already set you up in the Zimmerman family.

919
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,560
And you- Also, these people are all Chinese.

920
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:17,920
Oh, okay.

921
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:18,880
Grandpa!

922
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:22,000
Don't freak me out.

923
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:23,820
Okay, grandpa.

924
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:24,760
Hands are short.

925
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:26,220
My grandpa's in deep trouble.

926
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:27,420
Someone hexed him.

927
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:29,080
Is that from the stomach?

928
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:30,680
Yeah, that's the baby.

929
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,120
Save how?

930
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:34,540

01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:44,560
Susan, sorry.

932
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:46,920
Dad, catch it.

933
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:49,160
Catch the magic, dad.

934
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:56,490

01:04:03,230 --> 01:04:05,330

Katara clears.

961
01:04:39,170 --> 01:04:40,030
Okay, Katara.

962
01:04:40,270 --> 01:04:41,670

Oh, she's like new.

964
01:04:43,530 --> 01:04:44,430
Vector the Crocodile.

965
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:45,870
I think it's Sonic.

966
01:04:46,210 --> 01:04:47,690
I think it's Vector the Crocodile.

967
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:48,310
There's no...

968
01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:49,070

01:04:50,830 --> 01:04:52,170
Any Sonic character.

972
01:04:52,310 --> 01:04:54,810
I feel like it'd be Vector the Crocodile.

973
01:04:56,170 --> 01:04:56,690
Not 100.

974
01:04:56,690 --> 01:04:57,530

01:08:33,130 --> 01:08:33,390
No.

1015
01:08:36,990 --> 01:08:36,990
What?

1016
01:08:37,470 --> 01:08:37,910
You're really good.

1017
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:39,410
I really don't see it.

1018
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:43,430
But it is, I would say it is Overwatch.

1019
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:44,410
That's the thing.

1020
01:08:44,850 --> 01:08:59,070
But like, the thing is, like, Overwatch, like when Overwatch came out, I remember Pornhub released, like, most popular searches, and, like, Overwatch, at one point, dominated the Oh, yeah, I remember that.

1021
01:08:59,110 --> 01:09:00,210
I remember that.

1022
01:09:00,450 --> 01:09:01,870
And everyone was like, what the fuck?

1023
01:09:01,950 --> 01:09:03,370
And people were like, no, you don't understand.

1024
01:09:03,910 --> 01:09:06,050
This was SFM videos.

1025
01:09:06,550 --> 01:09:08,010
We're going wild.

1026
01:09:08,330 --> 01:10:06,650
but people were like making thousands of dollars each month just making these videos on patreon Melanie is gonna be more because she's more uh appealing to the mainstream I would say so too I think if it was I think it was like if it was tracer or diva I would be like obviously these girls a diva a diva doesn't she probably have like the most out of any Overwatch character I think it's diva or tracer because tracer at one point was like dominating everything until like and then and a diva started slowly gaining more appeal um and a cure cocaine oh mercy mercy too i forgot about mercy yeah yeah yeah yeah i don't want mercy i love that song you could have picked mercy you don't know that song i'm already mercy um pick tracer i'm already tracer

1027
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:11,330
You kidding me, Minimaker?

1028
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:14,910
A thousand, Ferissa.

1029
01:10:16,370 --> 01:10:16,850
A lot.

1030
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:19,470
But isn't she the main character of Horizon?

1031
01:10:20,490 --> 01:10:23,130
She is, but I don't know if she's that...

1032
01:10:23,130 --> 01:10:24,710
I mean, the game is popular.

1033
01:10:25,130 --> 01:10:27,610
But is there enough Rule 34?

1034
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:29,110
I think so.

1035
01:10:29,310 --> 01:10:29,870
I think it's her.

1036
01:10:30,170 --> 01:10:31,010
You think so?

1037
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:32,130
Are you all in?

1038
01:10:32,250 --> 01:10:34,010
Will you gamble your life away?

1039
01:10:34,350 --> 01:10:35,670
I'm already dead.

1040
01:10:36,970 --> 01:10:37,790
That's true.

1041
01:10:39,870 --> 01:10:40,910
Oh, nice.

1042
01:10:41,390 --> 01:10:41,950
Double or nothing.

1043
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:43,050
Life Weaver.

1044
01:10:44,970 --> 01:10:46,930
It's not that popular of a character.

1045
01:10:47,490 --> 01:10:48,830
I've never even heard of this person.

1046
01:10:48,830 --> 01:10:49,710
He's the newest.

1047
01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:52,570
Well, he's not new, but...

1048
01:10:52,570 --> 01:10:55,670
But, like, I don't think he's that popular.

1049
01:10:57,050 --> 01:10:58,090
Because, like...

1050
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:02,230
He's not new, guys.

1051
01:11:02,310 --> 01:11:04,830
He came out, like, one plus two years ago.

1052
01:11:05,230 --> 01:11:06,430
He's only...

1053
01:11:06,430 --> 01:11:08,310
He came out, like, two years ago.

1054
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:09,670
He's not new.

1055
01:11:10,830 --> 01:11:13,430
And have they released anyone since him?

1056
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:19,270
Yes, they've actually recently released a new character last month.

1057
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:20,390
Oh.

1058
01:11:20,530 --> 01:11:22,850
And he's like Tumblr's sexy man.

1059
01:11:23,850 --> 01:11:24,670
No way.

1060
01:11:24,710 --> 01:11:25,830
Wait, what's his name?

1061
01:11:26,110 --> 01:11:26,510
His name is.

1062
01:11:26,570 --> 01:11:28,230
I think it's like Wu Yang or something.

1063
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:28,810
I think.

1064
01:11:29,110 --> 01:11:29,970
Let me look it up.

1065
01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:32,550
Yeah, Wu Yang.

1066
01:11:33,430 --> 01:11:33,930
He's like...

1067
01:11:33,930 --> 01:11:34,510
Oh, you see the Tumblr...

1068
01:11:34,510 --> 01:11:36,450
Oh, I see you.

1069
01:11:38,330 --> 01:11:39,250
Yeah, yeah, you see it?

1070
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:41,290
I thought he was going to be like, I don't know.

1071
01:11:41,350 --> 01:11:43,070
I was expecting the one star yet.

1072
01:11:43,370 --> 01:11:46,010
Yeah, I was expecting him in a suit and everything.

1073
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:51,550
No, the thing is, they did a persona collab and they gave him the main character outfit.

1074
01:11:53,130 --> 01:11:54,770
Oh, I could see it.

1075
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:55,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're going to show you.

1076
01:11:57,990 --> 01:11:58,910
Oh, man.

1077
01:11:59,270 --> 01:12:02,830
Wow, that is Tumblr's sexy man.

1078
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:08,310
Yeah, he looks like the guy from Avatar, no?

1079
01:12:09,410 --> 01:12:10,290
Which one?

1080
01:12:10,870 --> 01:12:11,030
What?

1081
01:12:13,070 --> 01:12:13,350
Saka?

1082
01:12:15,270 --> 01:12:15,710
Saka.

1083
01:12:16,690 --> 01:12:17,130
Or...

1084
01:12:17,130 --> 01:12:18,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1085
01:12:18,350 --> 01:12:19,390
It's like the same outfit.

1086
01:12:19,550 --> 01:12:20,350
It's like the same outfit.

1087
01:12:20,410 --> 01:12:20,990
Oh, I guess.

1088
01:12:21,090 --> 01:12:21,330
Yeah.

1089
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:21,870
I don't know.

1090
01:12:22,090 --> 01:12:22,770
What do you mean?

1091
01:12:23,570 --> 01:12:25,030
Saka's outfit's not that.

1092
01:12:26,110 --> 01:12:28,150
It is like the main...

1093
01:12:28,150 --> 01:12:29,030
No, he has bandit.

1094
01:12:29,270 --> 01:12:32,490
Oh, you mean all the first... The OG outfit.

1095
01:12:33,090 --> 01:12:33,690
Yeah, it's OG.

1096
01:12:33,890 --> 01:12:34,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1097
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:37,790
Oh, yeah, I can sort of see it.

1098
01:12:38,330 --> 01:12:38,730
Yeah.

1099
01:12:39,450 --> 01:12:39,570
Yeah.

1100
01:12:39,650 --> 01:12:40,750
So I was like, Zuko?

1101
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:42,490
Zuko.

1102
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:45,730
I think it's Aloy.

1103
01:12:45,910 --> 01:12:46,750
I don't think it's life.

1104
01:12:46,790 --> 01:12:47,510
I think it's Aloy.

1105
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:48,890
I think he has enough content.

1106
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:50,290
Yeah, definitely not.

1107
01:12:50,650 --> 01:12:51,530
I've got 132.

1108
01:12:51,530 --> 01:12:52,430
Get off the sign.

1109
01:12:52,710 --> 01:12:53,230
Get off the sign.

1110
01:12:53,530 --> 01:12:55,970
What if Nomu has more than life?

1111
01:12:56,170 --> 01:12:59,110
I think people use Nomu as a self-insert.

1112
01:13:01,450 --> 01:13:02,590
I'm pretty sure.

1113
01:13:03,530 --> 01:13:04,390
I'm pretty sure.

1114
01:13:04,670 --> 01:13:05,110
Because like...

1115
01:13:05,110 --> 01:13:07,070
How many people are using Nomu?

1116
01:13:07,390 --> 01:13:07,910
No.

1117
01:13:08,330 --> 01:13:20,230
No, like you just see the like like just one part of the body and they put no more as a tag No more maybe Yeah, no more.

1118
01:13:20,330 --> 01:13:22,090
I feel I feel like it's no more.

1119
01:13:22,190 --> 01:13:29,410
There's no My hero the like the name saves him Yeah, the name he's just a name frat.

1120
01:13:29,550 --> 01:13:33,670
Oh my god What are we doing with no more?

1121
01:13:33,670 --> 01:13:35,630
I did not know your game.

1122
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:37,950
Whoa, what is your game?

1123
01:13:38,070 --> 01:13:38,310
No more?

1124
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:41,190
The Nobu is sweet.

1125
01:13:41,730 --> 01:13:42,250
Nobu.

1126
01:13:44,770 --> 01:13:46,310
I don't know, Trish.

1127
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:50,030
Someone was saying Nobu is like the ugly bastard.

1128
01:13:51,310 --> 01:13:52,490
That's what I was thinking.

1129
01:13:52,630 --> 01:13:54,190
That's what I was thinking, yeah.

1130
01:13:55,370 --> 01:13:56,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1131
01:13:56,930 --> 01:14:00,250
You always get like that big ugly creature that's like...

1132
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:01,470
It's like kind of like...

1133
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:03,830
It's kind of like getting like a Minotaur or something.

1134
01:14:05,130 --> 01:14:06,930
See, this is why I brought Minotaur.

1135
01:14:10,490 --> 01:14:12,010
She's very cultured.

1136
01:14:18,590 --> 01:14:20,090
Yeah, he's an orc, right?

1137
01:14:20,190 --> 01:14:21,630
He's the orc and the orc massage.

1138
01:14:22,130 --> 01:14:22,890
Exactly, it's like getting an orc.

1139
01:14:23,030 --> 01:14:23,830
It's like he's getting an orc.

1140
01:14:23,990 --> 01:14:25,090
I think Nomu's still.

1141
01:14:25,390 --> 01:14:26,090
Nomu's still?

1142
01:14:26,450 --> 01:14:26,750
Is it?

1143
01:14:35,670 --> 01:14:36,070
Or

1144
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:42,440
say.

1145
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:43,980
Oh, who was it?

1146
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:46,520
Cheese the chow.

1147
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:50,200
No, that's...

1148
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:52,140
No, that's it!

1149
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,240
And a cheese!

1150
01:14:54,860 --> 01:14:55,340
Ciao!

1151
01:14:58,800 --> 01:14:59,840
I can't...

1152
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:07,610
I think because it's Sonic the Hedgehog, then I believe...

1153
01:15:07,610 --> 01:15:07,850
Cheese.

1154
01:15:08,810 --> 01:15:10,850
Yes, what do you believe about cheese?

1155
01:15:11,390 --> 01:15:12,150
I think it's him.

1156
01:15:12,370 --> 01:15:16,270
Because it's another kind of character that you can just kind of stick in there, you know?

1157
01:15:16,610 --> 01:15:17,510
Like, as like...

1158
01:15:17,510 --> 01:15:22,170
Sometimes, I don't know if Rule 34 is like this, but like Donbore is kind of like this.

1159
01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:23,150
No, I know they do that.

1160
01:15:23,510 --> 01:15:26,510
If a character is like a plushie or something, you know, it'll still tag it.

1161
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:28,010
Oh, no, I agree.

1162
01:15:28,270 --> 01:15:28,590
I agree.

1163
01:15:28,930 --> 01:15:32,310
So maybe, guys, guys, don't have, don't lose faith in humanity.

1164
01:15:32,450 --> 01:15:34,770
He might just be like in the background, guys.

1165
01:15:35,010 --> 01:15:35,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1166
01:15:35,830 --> 01:15:37,630
He might just be in the background.

1167
01:15:38,710 --> 01:15:40,970
Oh, you know, I'm glad we're wrong.

1168
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:42,510
I'm so happy.

1169
01:15:42,910 --> 01:15:44,690
I'm so...

1170
01:15:44,690 --> 01:15:45,270
I'm not.

1171
01:15:45,350 --> 01:15:46,230
I wanted to get the 20.

1172
01:15:48,210 --> 01:16:04,530
You have no morals anymore You just want You're committed to the grind Oh my god Superior I don't know this character Is he popular?

1173
01:16:04,550 --> 01:16:06,890

1174
01:16:07,170 --> 01:16:19,350
I can't tell I can't tell if you see her she The name is very ambiguous Yeah It sounds like a drink at Starfight I would like one grand day on the Cheeto, please.

1175
01:16:20,570 --> 01:16:23,350
Okay, you guys cannot be surprised about 3K for Superior.

1176
01:16:23,530 --> 01:16:25,010
I'm honestly surprised it's not more.

1177
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:26,330
It's like Naga.

1178
01:16:27,010 --> 01:16:27,190
Yeah.

1179
01:16:27,470 --> 01:16:29,250
It's a literal tentacle.

1180
01:16:29,490 --> 01:16:30,570
Are you kidding me right now?

1181
01:16:32,370 --> 01:16:34,150
But think about this.

1182
01:16:35,130 --> 01:16:36,330
The snake.

1183
01:16:36,730 --> 01:16:37,430

Snake OC.

1188
01:16:47,850 --> 01:16:48,610
Think of...

1189
01:16:48,610 --> 01:16:49,950
Oh no, shut up.

1190
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:54,840
Oh, Snake OC!

1191
01:16:58,670 --> 01:17:00,170
Alright, lock in, Zerperior.

1192
01:17:00,630 --> 01:17:02,330
Just lock in, Zerperior.

1193
01:17:02,930 --> 01:17:03,410
Oh!

1194
01:17:05,670 --> 01:17:07,630
Oh, I think Genshin Impact.

1195
01:17:09,690 --> 01:17:11,090
I don't even know Soraka.

1196
01:17:11,550 --> 01:17:20,490
Someone in my chat knows a lot about Snake Anatomy for some fucking reason, and was like, Yeah, Joki, Snake's up too!

1197
01:17:22,990 --> 01:17:52,690
how do you why do you know that specific knowledge which one do you choose Soraka why is I mean I don't even know who she is I don't know I think it's also like if it's league they gotta be super popular in league like I feel like I have to know them she's like one of the oldest characters in league so like so like she had the Prime material,

1198
01:17:52,890 --> 01:17:53,310
you know?

1199
01:17:54,430 --> 01:17:55,550
Oh, that's hard.

1200
01:17:56,210 --> 01:17:57,790
The buildup of material.

1201
01:17:58,550 --> 01:17:59,390
Then maybe her, yeah.

1202
01:17:59,650 --> 01:18:00,710
Yeah, 4.8.

1203
01:18:01,770 --> 01:18:02,170
Shante?

1204
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:03,090
Oh, you're an expert.

1205
01:18:03,430 --> 01:18:04,230
You're an expert.

1206
01:18:04,890 --> 01:18:08,450
Oh, this is how...

1207
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:11,330
I think Shante is very popular, but beating...

1208
01:18:12,310 --> 01:18:13,130
This song.

1209
01:18:14,770 --> 01:18:17,150
But does it beat league popular?

1210
01:18:17,770 --> 01:18:20,810
I don't... I think Shante is like...

1211
01:18:21,230 --> 01:18:22,310
She's like a sex symbol.

1212
01:18:22,510 --> 01:18:22,850
She's...

1213
01:18:23,330 --> 01:18:24,270
She's super hot.

1214
01:18:25,270 --> 01:18:25,970
I think Shantae.

1215
01:18:27,970 --> 01:18:29,450
Oh, you got it.

1216
01:18:29,490 --> 01:18:30,590
It's Shantae.

1217
01:18:31,990 --> 01:18:32,790
That's my girl.

1218
01:18:33,590 --> 01:18:34,510
Are you gonna stick with your girl?

1219
01:18:34,830 --> 01:18:34,910
Shantae.

1220
01:18:35,070 --> 01:18:35,930
Yeah, I think Shantae.

1221
01:18:36,830 --> 01:18:37,170
Oh, yeah.

1222
01:18:37,270 --> 01:18:38,210
Ermi's had nothing.

1223
01:18:39,490 --> 01:18:40,830
Ermi's Conan.

1224
01:18:41,770 --> 01:18:43,810
Oh, I hate when it's a battle between unpunk.

1225
01:18:44,170 --> 01:18:45,090
Yeah, yeah.

1226
01:18:45,390 --> 01:18:46,890
It's like the way the fuck is.

1227
01:18:46,890 --> 01:18:47,790
It's just...

1228
01:18:47,790 --> 01:18:47,850
Yeah.

1229
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:49,870
Who?

1230
01:18:50,270 --> 01:18:50,750
Who?

1231
01:18:51,170 --> 01:18:53,210
There's so many Naruto characters.

1232
01:18:53,330 --> 01:18:53,830
man.

1233
01:18:54,350 --> 01:18:55,550
There is so many.

1234
01:18:56,790 --> 01:18:58,990
Yeah, I don't I mean, it's under Naruto.

1235
01:18:59,510 --> 01:19:01,250
Naruto is more popular than Jojo, right?

1236
01:19:02,850 --> 01:19:04,910
I guess technically.

1237
01:19:06,010 --> 01:19:09,290
And like, like, I don't know.

1238
01:19:09,430 --> 01:19:14,690
I feel like with more Naruto degenerates than Jojo, I feel like Conan would win, right?

1239
01:19:15,070 --> 01:19:18,070
Like, oh, apparently she's the one, she's the only girl.

1240
01:19:18,190 --> 01:19:18,990
Is she the only girl?

1241
01:19:19,150 --> 01:19:20,310
There's no way she's the only girl.

1242
01:19:20,330 --> 01:19:25,150
She's the only What is it called?

1243
01:19:25,570 --> 01:19:26,050
A cat?

1244
01:19:27,350 --> 01:19:28,690
What is it called?

1245
01:19:29,530 --> 01:19:30,930
I don't know, I've never watched her.

1246
01:19:31,150 --> 01:19:31,870
Have you watched Naruto?

1247
01:19:32,090 --> 01:19:33,070
I've never watched Naruto.

1248
01:19:33,450 --> 01:19:34,130
No, I've never.

1249
01:19:35,090 --> 01:19:38,250
She is the only evil, evil girl.

1250
01:19:38,570 --> 01:19:39,830
Oh, she's the only girl.

1251
01:19:40,110 --> 01:19:43,350
Okay, she's the only girl, so like they have nothing to like steal.

1252
01:19:43,570 --> 01:19:44,550
Screw you, Kimata.

1253
01:19:44,950 --> 01:19:45,970
Oh, okay, yeah, there we go.

1254
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:46,710
Alright.

1255
01:19:47,270 --> 01:19:48,310
Tangles the Lever.

1256
01:19:48,470 --> 01:19:52,170
Okay, even though I would say the Sonic buff, who the fuck is Tangles the Lever?

1257
01:19:53,730 --> 01:19:55,970
And it says, like, yeah.

1258
01:19:57,330 --> 01:19:59,270
But, I don't know.

1259
01:19:59,430 --> 01:20:00,470
Like, who's Tangled?

1260
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:02,150
Like, this person existed?

1261
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:04,130
Oh, only in the comics, too.

1262
01:20:04,350 --> 01:20:06,050
It says, yeah, Sonic the Hedgehog comp.

1263
01:20:06,150 --> 01:20:08,770
But there's, like, a, there's, like, a CG of her, so.

1264
01:20:09,030 --> 01:20:10,010
Maybe it's fan-made.

1265
01:20:10,350 --> 01:20:10,770
Maybe she has a model.

1266
01:20:10,950 --> 01:20:11,270
I don't know.

1267
01:20:11,310 --> 01:20:11,710
I don't know.

1268
01:20:11,790 --> 01:20:16,210
Sonic fans would do anything for, like, any Sonic character.

1269
01:20:17,330 --> 01:20:20,790
But, like, she's only- But enough to beat 2,665?

1270
01:20:20,830 --> 01:20:21,230
The five?

1271
01:20:21,830 --> 01:20:23,310
Is it, is Sonic enough to be?

1272
01:20:23,330 --> 01:20:54,270
be conan the only girl in the in the gang what if what if tangle has 2666 it's sonic but it's like hard because it's like not yeah because like how many sonic fans read the comics how many wait we got uh we got that one guy from sonic earlier yeah he was 900 900 so i feel like tangle was be Yeah,

1273
01:20:54,290 --> 01:20:54,910
I think it's Conan.

1274
01:20:55,530 --> 01:20:58,410
Oh my god, 2,100 for Ruben.

1275
01:20:58,610 --> 01:21:01,850
Who is he in here?

1276
01:21:02,630 --> 01:21:03,070
What?

1277
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:05,710
Why is the streamer in here?

1278
01:21:06,150 --> 01:21:07,210
Who is the- What?

1279
01:21:07,410 --> 01:21:08,570
Okay, zero post.

1280
01:21:08,990 --> 01:21:11,390
Okay, I'm so- Then he can't be on this site!

1281
01:21:11,490 --> 01:21:13,250
Why is he in the site?

1282
01:21:14,930 --> 01:21:15,970
Who is he?

1283
01:21:16,410 --> 01:21:19,170
How did they put- Wait, how do we add ourselves in here?

1284
01:21:19,190 --> 01:21:20,230
Oh wait, no, we are in here.

1285
01:21:20,590 --> 01:21:21,710
Wait, can we make suggestions?

1286
01:21:23,330 --> 01:21:24,690
suggestions in here?

1287
01:21:25,030 --> 01:21:27,010
How do we make ad-p-things?

1288
01:21:29,190 --> 01:21:33,310
Also, whoever uploads here does not upload enough VTuber stuff.

1289
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:35,610
Like, Watame only having 392?

1290
01:21:35,730 --> 01:21:36,230
That ain't right.

1291
01:21:36,550 --> 01:21:36,930
I don't believe that.

1292
01:21:37,570 --> 01:21:38,830
Look up Damboree right now.

1293
01:21:38,910 --> 01:21:39,630
How much is you?

1294
01:21:40,130 --> 01:21:41,030
Look, okay.

1295
01:21:41,110 --> 01:21:43,150
If I do Damboree and then also like...

1296
01:21:43,150 --> 01:21:43,650
Wait, hold on.

1297
01:21:43,710 --> 01:21:44,750
I say Damboree.

1298
01:21:46,910 --> 01:21:47,710
Let's see.

1299
01:21:48,310 --> 01:21:48,910
What's...

1300
01:21:48,910 --> 01:21:49,470
Uh...

1301
01:21:49,470 --> 01:21:51,330
Su-no...

1302
01:21:54,410 --> 01:21:57,910
Well, actually, I feel like Pixiv would be a better gauge.

1303
01:21:58,190 --> 01:22:00,450
Oh, apparently there's like vile clips of Ruben.

1304
01:22:00,610 --> 01:22:01,430
That's why he got in.

1305
01:22:01,490 --> 01:22:03,990
So I think the developers added him as an Easter egg.

1306
01:22:05,890 --> 01:22:06,370
That's why.

1307
01:22:07,110 --> 01:22:09,290
He breaks the R34 rules.

1308
01:22:09,690 --> 01:22:12,870
Yeah, he breaks... Because there's zero posts of him.

1309
01:22:13,010 --> 01:22:14,230
That means it doesn't follow.

1310
01:22:14,390 --> 01:22:14,890
It doesn't.

1311
01:22:14,910 --> 01:22:17,690
Oh, I guess it's like the free card in Bingo.

1312
01:22:19,830 --> 01:22:20,750
Oh, yeah.

1313
01:22:21,070 --> 01:22:21,530
All right.

1314
01:22:21,710 --> 01:22:22,890
How many in Damboro?

1315
01:22:24,230 --> 01:22:54,110
uh people are saying 3.1k but i don't know if that includes the safer work and not safe if they i don't know but 3.1 3.1 that's pretty good yeah i think that's just the safer work there's no way there's no no that doesn't include the safer work they mix they mix like the not safe and safe for work stuff so you gotta like you gotta put like rating safe or whatever oh i see i was like there's no way it's that low i was like there's no way all right Who's Siri?

1316
01:22:55,590 --> 01:22:58,130
I think she's like one of the main characters, no?

1317
01:22:58,410 --> 01:22:58,790
Is she?

1318
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:00,990
I've never played the witch.

1319
01:23:01,330 --> 01:23:03,810
Yeah, we're so classy right now.

1320
01:23:03,810 --> 01:23:06,310
We're making some classy decisions in life.

1321
01:23:08,770 --> 01:23:11,770
Oh, so I was like, Witcher has 11k on Pixiv alone.

1322
01:23:13,950 --> 01:23:18,450
Oh, this feels like we're doing some, we're making some holy decisions right now.

1323
01:23:18,690 --> 01:23:22,150
In the name of God, we are picking, we are picking.

1324
01:23:22,150 --> 01:23:22,590
Siri!

1325
01:23:23,130 --> 01:23:23,590
Siri?

1326
01:23:24,350 --> 01:23:24,550
Yeah.

1327
01:23:25,510 --> 01:23:27,150
Oh my god, 11k?

1328
01:23:29,110 --> 01:23:29,410
Tails.

1329
01:23:29,550 --> 01:23:30,330
Oh, Tails.

1330
01:23:30,610 --> 01:23:31,050
Tails.

1331
01:23:31,350 --> 01:23:31,790
There's no way.

1332
01:23:31,970 --> 01:23:33,150
Tails clears off.

1333
01:23:33,470 --> 01:23:34,530
Tails, thank you.

1334
01:23:34,990 --> 01:23:35,550
No!

1335
01:23:35,870 --> 01:23:36,150
No!

1336
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:41,040
I still think it's Tails.

1337
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:42,140
It has to be Tails.

1338
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:44,620
I don't think the entire franchise of winning the...

1339
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:45,260
But thank god.

1340
01:23:45,620 --> 01:23:46,120
Thank god.

1341
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:47,760
Inside of the Korra.

1342
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:52,560
Because like, why do they had so little though?

1343
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,320
Why is she have no picture?

1344
01:23:58,220 --> 01:25:06,900
the only picture they could find was not safe for work i think poo having 1300 almost 1400 is really horrible it's pretty bad oh my god i guess it's the mom it's it's kanga's mom i guess like okay okay you had okay you had 2k yeah her mom has a lot and but a lot of the other girls haven't a bunch so it really depends on who's uploading them you know you have that one okayu fan that's exactly you have some dedicated okayu fans but check what out does she have a dedicated fan yeah does she have a dedicated oh my god that means there's a dedicated witty the poo enthusiast that's been uploaded when do you think the most recent witty the poo was uploaded i'm not searching i'm not putting that in my search history that is not going in there you you can the honor man you can oh i'm not doing that yes three hours ago three hours ago was the last winnie the poo upload no way

1347
01:27:05,010 --> 01:27:06,690
Okay, we add them up.

1348
01:27:06,850 --> 01:27:08,650
Okay, Oka, you had 2K.

1349
01:27:09,070 --> 01:27:10,410
But Korra had 1K.

1350
01:27:10,750 --> 01:27:13,210
So that's already, you know, that's already 3K.

1351
01:27:13,510 --> 01:27:14,330
And then we add Marine.

1352
01:27:15,050 --> 01:27:16,650
That's 8K.

1353
01:27:16,670 --> 01:27:18,190
Now we have the rest of the...

1354
01:27:18,190 --> 01:27:18,810
There's no way.

1355
01:27:19,370 --> 01:27:21,490
Wait, is this including, like, English?

1356
01:27:22,030 --> 01:27:22,910
Yeah, this is.

1357
01:27:23,810 --> 01:27:25,490
There's an entire...

1358
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:26,610
It's definitely Hololive.

1359
01:27:26,650 --> 01:27:28,030
It has to be Hololive.

1360
01:27:28,070 --> 01:27:28,830
There's no way.

1361
01:27:28,850 --> 01:27:31,450
I'm like adding up the ones that we saw.

1362
01:27:32,730 --> 01:27:33,750
Oh my god.

1363
01:27:34,430 --> 01:27:34,750
66.

1364
01:27:35,150 --> 01:27:36,130
I'm sorry, Sayori.

1365
01:27:36,310 --> 01:27:38,430
You're not beating 66,000 dollars.

1366
01:27:41,210 --> 01:27:42,750
Guda is like half of the house.

1367
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:46,870
Yeah, I was going to say Guda is going to be like 30k.

1368
01:27:51,510 --> 01:27:53,610
I would say Sayori.

1369
01:27:54,090 --> 01:27:55,770
Juvie's not a main character, right?

1370
01:27:57,830 --> 01:28:00,870
Uh, Juvia is...

1371
01:28:00,870 --> 01:28:04,370
It's like, Sayori is huge in Western Adams.

1372
01:28:04,890 --> 01:28:06,050
I think probably it's Sayori.

1373
01:28:06,710 --> 01:28:07,930
Yeah, it should be Sayori.

1374
01:28:09,310 --> 01:28:10,930
She would be in all the group pictures.

1375
01:28:10,930 --> 01:28:13,430
I think Juvia is a bigger character, but I don't remember.

1376
01:28:13,810 --> 01:28:16,530
I didn't watch Fairy Tale, my roommate did.

1377
01:28:16,930 --> 01:28:18,110
I didn't watch it either.

1378
01:28:18,390 --> 01:28:20,530
Juvia, hands down, Sayori.

1379
01:28:21,290 --> 01:28:24,290
Someone's like, Juvia is very popular.

1380
01:28:25,770 --> 01:28:27,570
To be is still gunable.

1381
01:28:29,250 --> 01:28:31,870
What made it stop being gunable?

1382
01:28:34,090 --> 01:28:34,750
I don't know.

1383
01:28:35,410 --> 01:28:37,770
I think Kodokie Doki is such a big, like...

1384
01:28:37,770 --> 01:28:38,150
Yeah.

1385
01:28:38,550 --> 01:28:40,370
I mean, so is Fairy Tale, but...

1386
01:28:40,370 --> 01:28:40,930
That's true.

1387
01:28:41,450 --> 01:28:41,830
That's true.

1388
01:28:42,030 --> 01:28:43,250
Fairy Tale's been around for a while.

1389
01:28:43,430 --> 01:28:43,810
Yeah.

1390
01:28:45,670 --> 01:28:46,770
I don't know here.

1391
01:28:47,710 --> 01:28:49,790
We could... Wait, what's our streak right now?

1392
01:28:50,210 --> 01:28:50,850
It's 16.

1393
01:28:51,110 --> 01:28:52,690
It's the best we've done so far.

1394
01:28:52,990 --> 01:28:54,050
You guys, this is important!

1395
01:28:54,290 --> 01:28:54,830
This is important!

1396
01:28:54,970 --> 01:28:55,750
Lock in, lock in!

1397
01:28:55,770 --> 01:28:56,970
We got locked in.

1398
01:28:57,290 --> 01:28:58,530
We got hit 20.

1399
01:29:00,950 --> 01:29:03,650
I would say Sayori is bigger in the West.

1400
01:29:03,790 --> 01:29:04,570
I think Sayori.

1401
01:29:05,210 --> 01:29:06,150
I'm going to say Yori.

1402
01:29:07,510 --> 01:29:08,450
Oh, that was bad.

1403
01:29:08,550 --> 01:29:10,610
Everybody who said Juvia, easy.

1404
01:29:10,970 --> 01:29:12,790
Juvia, there's no way Baptiste.

1405
01:29:13,310 --> 01:29:13,970
There's no way.

1406
01:29:13,970 --> 01:29:14,730
I'll trust you.

1407
01:29:15,030 --> 01:29:16,390
Yeah, that's reasonable.

1408
01:29:19,610 --> 01:29:20,110
Chihaya.

1409
01:29:21,070 --> 01:29:23,830
Mifune Chihaya from Persona 5.

1410
01:29:23,990 --> 01:29:45,090
I mean, she's a girl, so I assume she'll have more just because of that is she she i've never seen her before though i feel like i feel i've never seen her either but like just because she's more than 210 yeah more than 200 200 is so and that removes oh It's a song!

1411
01:30:03,750 --> 01:30:05,670
It was

1412
01:30:16,830 --> 01:30:18,870
such perfect timing!

1413
01:30:28,780 --> 01:30:29,820
Our streak!

1414
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:31,360
Our streak!

1415
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:33,060
Oh, Jill Valentine.

1416
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:34,740
Oh my gosh.

1417
01:30:37,160 --> 01:30:38,960
Oh, this one's hard.

1418
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:41,980
It has to be Morgan!

1419
01:30:42,300 --> 01:31:08,580
She was like the gooner girl for longest time uh but then jill shows up so many times though i don't know honestly how you go oh my god i don't know i okay jill we'll go in then jill oh 18k okay good good good yeah yeah i was gonna say who the oh morgan morgan morgan yeah i was gonna say there's no way why does she have 2800!

1420
01:31:08,620 --> 01:31:09,240
Oh, wait.

1421
01:31:09,340 --> 01:31:09,760
Yay!

1422
01:31:10,260 --> 01:31:11,440
We got a freebie!

1423
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:16,000
The game felt sorry for us.

1424
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:17,900
Yay!

1425
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:19,560
Here we go from Fate.

1426
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:21,860
From Fate Geo.

1427
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:23,140
I think it's still Morgan.

1428
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:24,260
I think it's still Morgan.

1429
01:31:25,900 --> 01:31:26,800
There's no way.

1430
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:27,420
Freebie, baby!

1431
01:31:27,860 --> 01:31:28,380
Freebie!

1432
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:30,700
The game felt bad for us.

1433
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:31,440
Pearl!

1434
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:33,220
Oh, I think it's Pearl.

1435
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:34,040
I think it's Pearl.

1436
01:31:34,340 --> 01:31:35,380
Splatoon is huge.

1437
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:38,560
Yeah, it's huge in, like, Japan, too.

1438
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:39,500
It has to be Pearl.

1439
01:31:39,600 --> 01:32:10,960
yeah if it was the other one then it'll be even more shadow heart shadow heart right shadow heart oh my god bye oh my god it's our freebie race these are baldergate fans what are you doing what are you doing what happened balder's game won game of the year for nothing how dare you not start gooning i think i know i would pick a little versus you you It's a Yu-Gi-Oh-Hakusho.

1440
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:12,720
Yu-Gi-Oh-Gi-Oh-Gi-Oh-Shou.

1441
01:32:12,980 --> 01:32:13,680
But it's Piccolo.

1442
01:32:14,580 --> 01:32:16,720
I'm surprised Piccolo only has 600.

1443
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:17,980
Oh, I'm gonna tell him.

1444
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:18,940
I feel like...

1445
01:32:18,940 --> 01:32:20,620
No, I think it's because then...

1446
01:32:20,620 --> 01:32:23,980
Is it only Dragon Ball Piccolo or does it include Dragon Ball Z Piccolo?

1447
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:24,780
Oh, that's true.

1448
01:32:24,900 --> 01:32:26,740
Because it says anime and manga.

1449
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:28,680
So it could just be like...

1450
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:30,060
Because it doesn't need Dragon Ball Z.

1451
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:31,760
Or anything.

1452
01:32:31,900 --> 01:32:32,160
Yeah.

1453
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:32,640
I don't know.

1454
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:33,860
But it's like the character...

1455
01:32:33,860 --> 01:32:34,600
That's true.

1456
01:32:34,740 --> 01:32:36,140
Yeah, I can't tell.

1457
01:32:36,940 --> 01:32:38,080
All right, just barely.

1458
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:39,440
You almost...

1459
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:40,760
Storm, the Albatross.

1460
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:41,620
There's no way.

1461
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:42,420
There's no way.

1462
01:32:42,460 --> 01:32:43,740
Always bet on Sonic, right?

1463
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:45,260
Why?

1464
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:48,400
We haven't before in the past, but try, try, try.

1465
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:49,140
I'm curious.

1466
01:32:49,620 --> 01:32:49,720
Oh.

1467
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:52,000
I was like, I don't remember.

1468
01:32:52,140 --> 01:32:52,920
Oh, Hasman Hotel.

1469
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:54,620
Hasman Hotel?

1470
01:32:55,460 --> 01:32:56,880
The entire... Oh.

1471
01:32:57,400 --> 01:32:57,740
Oh, Isol.

1472
01:32:57,860 --> 01:32:58,460
Isol.

1473
01:32:59,100 --> 01:32:59,540
For sure.

1474
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:00,980
At little?

1475
01:33:01,460 --> 01:33:02,400
I would think... At little.

1476
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:04,840
At a pretty hot dog!

1477
01:33:07,430 --> 01:33:10,050
Are the furries that damn bad?

1478
01:33:11,270 --> 01:33:11,710
Animaniacs.

1479
01:33:11,910 --> 01:33:12,570
The nurse.

1480
01:33:14,950 --> 01:33:15,830
Hello, nurse.

1481
01:33:16,710 --> 01:33:18,250
I think it's Animaniacs.

1482
01:33:18,510 --> 01:33:19,070
It has to be.

1483
01:33:19,210 --> 01:33:19,530
The nurse.

1484
01:33:19,690 --> 01:33:20,690
The nurse carries.

1485
01:33:22,910 --> 01:33:25,730
I don't know what nurse you're talking about, but I believe you.

1486
01:33:25,770 --> 01:33:27,130
You don't know the famous line.

1487
01:33:27,450 --> 01:33:28,790
Hello, nurse.

1488
01:33:29,330 --> 01:33:29,710
Hold on.

1489
01:33:29,830 --> 01:33:30,190
Anime.

1490
01:33:30,370 --> 01:33:31,350
Let's see how hot she is.

1491
01:33:31,590 --> 01:33:32,030
Animaniacs.

1492
01:33:32,050 --> 01:33:33,650
I don't know what she looks like, but I know.

1493
01:33:33,850 --> 01:33:34,290
Nurse.

1494
01:33:36,150 --> 01:33:37,750
Yeah, it's a nurse carry.

1495
01:33:38,010 --> 01:33:38,510
I told

1496
01:33:42,370 --> 01:33:42,610
her.

1497
01:33:42,930 --> 01:33:44,650
I'm literally a wugaiing right now.

1498
01:33:45,850 --> 01:33:47,110
She carries!

1499
01:33:47,330 --> 01:33:48,510
I told you!

1500
01:33:48,510 --> 01:33:49,090
She carries!

1501
01:33:50,170 --> 01:33:52,570
Damn, guys, she's hot!

1502
01:33:52,890 --> 01:33:54,060
Wait, I'm sending it to you?

1503
01:33:55,270 --> 01:33:55,650
Yeah?

1504
01:33:56,610 --> 01:33:57,050
Oh!

1505
01:33:58,590 --> 01:34:00,130
She's so sexy!

1506
01:34:00,890 --> 01:34:01,650
Yeah, hello!

1507
01:34:02,710 --> 01:34:03,410
Nerds!

1508
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:04,710
Oh, nerds!

1509
01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:07,310
I'm sick.

1510
01:34:08,490 --> 01:34:10,990
I'm so sick right now.

1511
01:34:12,150 --> 01:34:14,070
I can't, I don't know.

1512
01:34:14,270 --> 01:34:14,750
No skates.

1513
01:34:14,830 --> 01:34:45,610

Yeah.

1515
01:34:47,110 --> 01:34:47,550
Bowser.

1516
01:34:47,770 --> 01:34:48,430
It's Bowser.

1517
01:34:49,450 --> 01:34:50,330
Bowser sweep.

1518
01:34:51,110 --> 01:34:51,670
It's Bowser.

1519
01:34:52,050 --> 01:34:55,670
One of my friends was a Bowser enthusiast.

1520
01:34:56,610 --> 01:34:59,730
Like, like, and they would draw Bara Bowser.

1521
01:35:00,010 --> 01:35:00,150
All right.

1522
01:35:00,290 --> 01:35:01,830
Wait, do you want me to show you one?

1523
01:35:02,150 --> 01:35:02,470

Is it Ito?

1534
01:37:22,030 --> 01:37:24,290
But then, like, remember the driving meme in Undertale?

1535
01:37:24,430 --> 01:37:25,430
Isn't she part of it?

1536
01:37:26,230 --> 01:37:27,630
I don't know the driving meme.

1537
01:37:27,850 --> 01:37:28,670
Oh, you don't know that.

1538
01:37:29,110 --> 01:37:31,830
Actually, I don't know anything about Delta Rune, so I don't know.

1539
01:37:31,890 --> 01:37:32,810
I'll leave it up to you.

1540
01:37:32,990 --> 01:37:34,410
Wait, people are saying Noel Sweep.

1541
01:37:34,690 --> 01:37:34,970
What?

1542
01:37:35,350 --> 01:37:36,030
Noel cleared.

1543
01:37:36,110 --> 01:37:37,550
Yeah, driving in my car.

1544
01:37:37,670 --> 01:37:39,570
Have you not heard about driving in my car?

1545
01:37:39,970 --> 01:37:40,290
No.

1546
01:37:40,470 --> 01:37:43,130
Where, like, the guy runs over, runs over people.

1547
01:37:43,970 --> 01:37:45,170
No, I've never heard of this.

1548
01:37:45,470 --> 01:37:45,870
Oh.

1549
01:37:46,790 --> 01:37:47,590
It's Noel.

1550
01:37:48,170 --> 01:37:50,210
Oh my gosh!

1551
01:37:50,710 --> 01:37:51,450
One Piece.

1552
01:37:51,770 --> 01:37:53,570
The entirety of One Piece.

1553
01:37:53,770 --> 01:37:54,830
I don't even need to know.

1554
01:37:55,730 --> 01:37:56,630
Oh, One Piece.

1555
01:37:56,730 --> 01:37:56,970
Yeah.

1556
01:37:57,230 --> 01:38:00,050
I was like, I don't even need to know what's...

1557
01:38:00,050 --> 01:38:01,390
Oh, High School D...

1558
01:38:01,390 --> 01:38:03,350
Oh, she's one of the main characters, no?

1559
01:38:03,610 --> 01:38:04,130
I don't know.

1560
01:38:04,210 --> 01:38:04,830
I never watched this.

1561
01:38:04,930 --> 01:38:06,110
You're my anime expert.

1562
01:38:06,690 --> 01:38:07,170
You're my...

1563
01:38:07,870 --> 01:38:09,230
You're the call of my friend.

1564
01:38:09,730 --> 01:38:13,230
I didn't watch High School DXD!

1565
01:38:13,830 --> 01:38:14,690
I think it's that one.

1566
01:38:14,690 --> 01:38:15,810
I think it's High School DXD.

1567
01:38:15,810 --> 01:38:16,590
It's High School.

1568
01:38:16,790 --> 01:38:17,790
Yeah, see?

1569
01:38:18,650 --> 01:38:24,150
Oh, beating the entire Anahara, Hana, Well, I don't know.

1570
01:38:24,330 --> 01:38:24,850
It's sparkle.

1571
01:38:25,170 --> 01:38:27,030
This guy never hit a thousand.

1572
01:38:27,650 --> 01:38:29,050
Yeah, Sparkle.

1573
01:38:29,710 --> 01:38:30,110
Eventually.

1574
01:38:30,710 --> 01:38:31,490
This is hard.

1575
01:38:32,770 --> 01:38:33,690
Because like, Clone Wars.

1576
01:38:34,210 --> 01:38:35,350
She's, yeah, she's a main character.

1577
01:38:35,490 --> 01:38:36,110
Yeah, isn't she?

1578
01:38:36,210 --> 01:38:36,630
Yeah, okay.

1579
01:38:36,690 --> 01:38:37,150
I remember.

1580
01:38:37,430 --> 01:38:37,870
I remember.

1581
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:40,410
I never watched Clone Wars, but I remember she was popular in Clone Wars.

1582
01:38:40,710 --> 01:38:40,990
Bleach.

1583
01:38:41,050 --> 01:38:45,030
I think, she's also popular, but I still think it's Ahsoka.

1584
01:38:45,230 --> 01:38:45,630
Ahsoka?

1585
01:38:46,290 --> 01:38:46,510
Yep.

1586
01:38:46,790 --> 01:38:47,350
Wow, yeah.

1587
01:38:48,010 --> 01:38:49,230
We're blazing through this.

1588
01:38:49,350 --> 01:38:50,310
We're gonna hit 20, guys.

1589
01:38:50,510 --> 01:38:51,050
Yeah, we're gonna hit 20.

1590
01:38:51,150 --> 01:38:51,630
We're gonna hit 20.

1591
01:38:51,670 --> 01:38:52,790
What the fuck is Twin Rova?

1592
01:38:52,810 --> 01:38:53,710
Stream ends at 20?

1593
01:38:54,050 --> 01:38:56,230
Yeah, stream ends at 20.

1594
01:38:56,730 --> 01:38:58,590
I don't know.

1595
01:39:00,150 --> 01:39:01,990
I don't know, Twin Rova.

1596
01:39:02,070 --> 01:39:03,090
I don't know either.

1597
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:06,110
I was gonna say, this person is...

1598
01:39:06,110 --> 01:39:07,150
Yeah, it looks like a boss.

1599
01:39:07,470 --> 01:39:08,230
Oh, holy!

1600
01:39:08,730 --> 01:39:09,890
No, you don't understand.

1601
01:39:09,970 --> 01:39:11,450
Kiriko, fucking clears.

1602
01:39:12,210 --> 01:39:12,850
This is hard.

1603
01:39:13,790 --> 01:39:14,950
I still think it would be Kiriko.

1604
01:39:15,050 --> 01:39:16,770
I don't think it would be Kiriko just from the end.

1605
01:39:16,790 --> 01:39:18,530
SFM videos alone.

1606
01:39:19,090 --> 01:39:19,770
There's a lot.

1607
01:39:20,330 --> 01:39:24,610
I mean, Vincent, obviously, but like, yeah, Kiriko, I think it's Kiriko.

1608
01:39:24,730 --> 01:39:25,310
It's Kiriko.

1609
01:39:26,210 --> 01:39:26,350
Yeah.

1610
01:39:26,530 --> 01:39:27,030
Oh, yeah.

1611
01:39:27,370 --> 01:39:29,170
Vincent was just crawling on the ground.

1612
01:39:29,550 --> 01:39:29,990
Oh, Chica.

1613
01:39:30,390 --> 01:39:30,430
Chica.

1614
01:39:31,230 --> 01:39:35,190
Wait, why do we get, why do we have, wait, why are there two Chicas?

1615
01:39:35,430 --> 01:39:36,550
You don't know Toy Chica?

1616
01:39:37,390 --> 01:39:39,990
Toy Chica was from Spinab too.

1617
01:39:40,370 --> 01:39:40,830
No, no.

1618
01:39:41,070 --> 01:39:42,410
Before it was Toy Chica.

1619
01:39:42,530 --> 01:39:43,550
Yeah, this was Chica.

1620
01:39:43,790 --> 01:39:44,590
Oh, okay, okay.

1621
01:39:44,950 --> 01:39:45,930
Chica was the OG Chica.

1622
01:39:46,250 --> 01:39:51,370
And then like, She went on and then Chica got on to Ozempic and then she became Toy Chica.

1623
01:39:51,950 --> 01:39:54,170
Yeah, that's what happened.

1624
01:39:54,570 --> 01:39:55,410
That's what happened.

1625
01:39:56,630 --> 01:39:57,510
So I forgot.

1626
01:39:57,790 --> 01:39:59,510
I thought it was just Chica before.

1627
01:39:59,770 --> 01:40:01,590
I didn't, I forgot it was Toy Chica.

1628
01:40:02,030 --> 01:40:02,810
My bad, everybody.

1629
01:40:03,030 --> 01:40:03,410
Chica sweet.

1630
01:40:04,350 --> 01:40:05,050
Chica time.

1631
01:40:05,610 --> 01:40:06,170
5k.

1632
01:40:06,390 --> 01:40:06,750
Jesus.

1633
01:40:08,510 --> 01:40:10,790
Has to be Full Metal Alchemist just alone.

1634
01:40:11,410 --> 01:40:13,650
Just from the boy love in general.

1635
01:40:14,510 --> 01:40:18,390
Full Metal Alchemist catered a lot to the BL fandom.

1636
01:40:18,570 --> 01:40:19,370
It did.

1637
01:40:19,670 --> 01:40:21,270
There were some hot girls in it too.

1638
01:40:21,530 --> 01:40:21,950
Yeah, that's true.

1639
01:40:22,170 --> 01:40:24,930
Alright, who was your favorite ships in Full Metal Alchemist?

1640
01:40:25,050 --> 01:40:26,950
Were you a Full Metal Alchemist fan though?

1641
01:40:27,410 --> 01:40:28,910
Yeah, but I didn't ship anybody.

1642
01:40:29,050 --> 01:40:30,250
Oh, I did.

1643
01:40:30,850 --> 01:40:31,050
Oh.

1644
01:40:31,250 --> 01:40:31,250
Oh.

1645
01:40:31,830 --> 01:40:32,710
I shipped a couple.

1646
01:40:32,710 --> 01:40:33,690
You're a real Fujo.

1647
01:40:33,930 --> 01:40:37,230
I shipped a couple before I read Full Metal Alchemist.

1648
01:40:37,530 --> 01:40:38,110
Wait, who?

1649
01:40:38,230 --> 01:40:38,430
Who?

1650
01:40:38,610 --> 01:40:38,770
Who?

1651
01:40:39,190 --> 01:40:40,310
Roy and Hughes.

1652
01:40:40,970 --> 01:40:43,010
I think a lot of people.

1653
01:40:43,210 --> 01:40:45,190
Yeah, a lot of people ship them though.

1654
01:40:45,530 --> 01:40:46,770
Okay, so...

1655
01:40:46,790 --> 01:40:53,910
Sometimes what I do is if I like the couple, I just like, I just read, I don't know what the actual source material is.

1656
01:40:54,210 --> 01:40:55,970
I just like how they look good together.

1657
01:40:56,490 --> 01:40:57,890
And then I just read fan, I don't know.

1658
01:40:57,990 --> 01:41:01,070
And then I learn the source material through fan fiction.

1659
01:41:01,530 --> 01:41:04,130
And from piecing together the context clues.

1660
01:41:05,490 --> 01:41:07,950
So like, how did Roy and Hughes work?

1661
01:41:08,030 --> 01:41:12,430
Because Hughes is, like, he's famous for being like, this is my darling daughter.

1662
01:41:12,690 --> 01:41:13,250
She's so cute.

1663
01:41:13,610 --> 01:41:16,250
During the training days, the military before.

1664
01:41:16,790 --> 01:41:29,490
they met and then it's like and then you know that's why roy is like extra emo because he chose his wife right that's good see that's good you get it you get it yes oh

1665
01:41:32,580 --> 01:41:52,860
my gosh and there's just this sexual tension that they always have best friends you know best friends to lovers oh you understand you understand now i'm an ex-fujo by the way i don't do that no Ex-Fujo, ex-Fujo, I don't do that anymore.

1666
01:41:54,120 --> 01:41:56,380
I only, I only Fujo one series, basically.

1667
01:42:00,100 --> 01:42:05,240
Because, like, my Fujo sense is retangling when my friends keep telling me to watch Arcane.

1668
01:42:05,300 --> 01:42:06,100
Have you ever watched Arcane?

1669
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:07,200
No.

1670
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:08,120
I haven't either.

1671
01:42:08,340 --> 01:42:12,380
But, like, I remember they showed me some characters, and there were two characters.

1672
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:14,560
And I was like, oh, are they a thing?

1673
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:17,260
I saw it.

1674
01:42:17,820 --> 01:42:19,100
That was gay bark.

1675
01:42:20,140 --> 01:42:22,080
Yeah, I saw two characters.

1676
01:42:22,500 --> 01:42:24,160
I was like, oh my god, are they a thing?

1677
01:42:24,460 --> 01:42:25,620
Oh, this is interesting.

1678
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:27,600
I don't know anything about the show.

1679
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:28,880
And I was just...

1680
01:42:29,580 --> 01:42:32,440
You guys, it's not EX as in X, EX.

1681
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:34,220
It's X as in the letter X.

1682
01:42:34,540 --> 01:42:35,980
She's still a food show.

1683
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:38,400
And then they're like...

1684
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:42,880
And then one of my friends was like, no, one of them is dating this other girl.

1685
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:43,660
And I was like...

1686
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:46,500
I was like...

1687
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:47,360
I was like...

1688
01:42:49,880 --> 01:42:51,120
Ex-a-doubt, yeah.

1689
01:42:51,160 --> 01:42:52,580
I hate it.

1690
01:42:57,060 --> 01:43:00,760
Okay, it has to be full metal alchemist.

1691
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:04,300
I definitely have hated girl characters because they messed with my shit.

1692
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:05,580
Yeah, yeah.

1693
01:43:05,960 --> 01:43:09,500
That was me with Axel and Roxas and the girl thing.

1694
01:43:09,900 --> 01:43:19,220
They introduced, why did they need to- Why did they have to introduce the random nobody who doesn't even have a fucking soul?

1695
01:43:19,880 --> 01:43:21,020
I know that argument.

1696
01:43:21,220 --> 01:43:23,760
I didn't ship them, but my friend was a hardcore Roku.

1697
01:43:23,900 --> 01:43:24,640
What was it called?

1698
01:43:24,820 --> 01:43:25,260
Akuroku.

1699
01:43:25,420 --> 01:43:25,720
Akuroku.

1700
01:43:25,780 --> 01:43:26,220
Akuroku.

1701
01:43:26,440 --> 01:43:26,520
Yeah.

1702
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:29,340
My women friends was a hardcore Akuroku.

1703
01:43:29,820 --> 01:43:32,340
And like, they were, they were so mad.

1704
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:34,220
I would hear their rants about Zion.

1705
01:43:34,260 --> 01:43:34,600
What was it?

1706
01:43:34,740 --> 01:43:35,040
What's it?

1707
01:43:35,100 --> 01:43:35,540
Zion?

1708
01:43:36,100 --> 01:43:37,620
Zion or Zion or something?

1709
01:43:37,620 --> 01:43:39,620
Honestly, I kind of fell out of the games.

1710
01:43:40,200 --> 01:43:42,940
Not because they introduced her, but like, I'd stop.

1711
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:45,400
Like, Kingdom Hearts lore got too crazy for me.

1712
01:43:45,660 --> 01:43:46,180
Oh yeah, it's true.

1713
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:47,180
I didn't play them.

1714
01:43:47,460 --> 01:43:56,280
Even the director would, you know how the, like, director or the writer of the Kingdom Hearts games would watch recap videos to remember what he wrote.

1715
01:43:56,280 --> 01:43:57,400
No way.

1716
01:43:57,740 --> 01:44:01,200
He watches YouTube recaps because he lost track of the plot.

1717
01:44:01,580 --> 01:44:02,340
So he's like, okay.

1718
01:44:02,860 --> 01:44:03,540
It shows.

1719
01:44:03,820 --> 01:44:04,460
It shows.

1720
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:06,900
Isn't it no more?

1721
01:44:07,320 --> 01:44:08,280
Oh my god.

1722
01:44:10,700 --> 01:44:12,600
Anyway, full metal alchemist.

1723
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:13,940
Full metal alchemist.

1724
01:44:20,700 --> 01:44:21,340
Why?

1725
01:44:21,340 --> 01:44:23,880
Why would we doubt FNAF fans, honestly?

1726
01:44:24,740 --> 01:44:26,200
Why would we doubt FNAF?

1727
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:28,400
Why would we doubt FNAF?

1728
01:44:29,200 --> 01:44:31,480
Oh my god, we can never get past 10 anymore.

1729
01:44:32,020 --> 01:44:32,440
I know.

1730
01:44:32,940 --> 01:44:34,060
It's so derpy.

1731
01:44:34,440 --> 01:44:35,080
Oh no.

1732
01:44:35,580 --> 01:44:35,620
No.

1733
01:44:35,900 --> 01:44:36,940
It has to be derpy.

1734
01:44:37,100 --> 01:44:37,740
No, the bronies.

1735
01:44:37,740 --> 01:44:38,480
I think it's derpy.

1736
01:44:39,320 --> 01:44:39,500
The bronies.

1737
01:44:39,500 --> 01:44:41,520
The bronies overpower FNAF.

1738
01:44:41,780 --> 01:44:42,460
There is no way.

1739
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:42,820
Yeah.

1740
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:43,900

Yes, she is.

01:45:06,630 --> 01:45:07,550
But she came.

1750

No way.

1869
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:46,640
Someone migrated Dambaru's images into Rule 3 anymore.

1870
01:51:47,480 --> 01:51:48,800
There's no way!

1871
01:51:49,800 --> 01:51:51,360
But it's so popular.

1872
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:53,560
Even I know no game, no life.

1873
01:51:54,300 --> 01:51:55,560
Even I know.

1874
01:51:55,980 --> 01:51:57,200
It's so popular.

1875
01:51:57,680 --> 01:51:58,580
That's crazy.

1876
01:51:59,740 --> 01:52:03,120

Link.

1881
01:52:36,260 --> 01:52:36,620
Link.

1882
01:52:37,020 --> 01:52:38,560
Oh, thank God.

1883
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:39,060
Link.

1884
01:52:39,120 --> 01:52:39,420
The game.

1885
01:52:39,940 --> 01:52:39,940
Oh.

1886
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:41,400
I still think it's Link.

1887
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:42,200
Is it still Link?

1888
01:52:42,740 --> 01:52:42,940
Okay.

1889
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:43,200
Yeah.

1890
01:52:43,480 --> 01:52:44,500
Because I know her, too.

1891
01:52:44,720 --> 01:52:46,000
Yeah, she's...

1892
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:46,720
I don't know her.

1893
01:52:47,140 --> 01:52:47,740
I don't know her.

1894
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:48,760
I don't know her.

1895
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:49,560
There's...

1896
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:50,360
She has to be new.

1897
01:52:50,460 --> 01:52:51,680
I don't recognize her at all.

1898
01:52:54,240 --> 01:52:54,520
Rin.

1899
01:52:54,640 --> 01:52:55,380
Yeah, Tosaka Rin.

1900
01:52:55,560 --> 01:52:56,220
Tosaka Rin?

1901
01:52:56,540 --> 01:52:56,660
Yeah.

1902
01:52:56,900 --> 01:52:58,240
Because I never seen her before.

1903
01:52:58,320 --> 01:52:59,640
I never even seen trailers of her.

1904
01:52:59,900 --> 01:53:00,300
Enderman!

1905
01:53:05,270 --> 01:53:06,970
It's a fine Tumblr sexy man.

1906
01:53:08,690 --> 01:53:10,530
Have you seen like the Minecraft?

1907
01:53:10,670 --> 01:53:18,270
There's like a Minecraft like a special Minecraft community dedicated to...

1908
01:53:19,930 --> 01:53:21,270
What are we saying here?

1909
01:53:21,330 --> 01:53:22,150
What are we saying here, Doki?

1910
01:53:22,650 --> 01:53:23,550
What are we saying here, Doki?

1911
01:53:23,890 --> 01:53:30,890
Dedicated to maybe Rule 34 stuff of Minecraft characters.

1912
01:53:32,010 --> 01:53:32,350
Wow.

1913
01:53:35,490 --> 01:53:37,670
It was a very especially...

1914
01:53:37,670 --> 01:53:39,830
Did you know about the Minecraft mod?

1915
01:53:40,650 --> 01:53:42,150
Oh, I've heard about those.

1916
01:53:42,350 --> 01:53:42,750
I've heard about those.

1917
01:53:42,750 --> 01:53:48,090
Oh, you know, you heard about the Minecraft mod that got C synthesis from Minecraft itself.

1918
01:53:48,490 --> 01:53:49,530
Wait, I don't know that.

1919
01:53:49,730 --> 01:53:49,950
What?

1920
01:53:53,270 --> 01:53:54,150
There's a mod.

1921
01:53:54,150 --> 01:53:56,390
There's an infamous Minecraft mod.

1922
01:53:58,150 --> 01:53:59,190
Where it's...

1923
01:54:00,270 --> 01:54:01,310
It's called...

1924
01:54:01,310 --> 01:54:03,230
It's called Jenny.

1925
01:54:05,550 --> 01:54:06,730
I'm looking it up.

1926
01:54:06,730 --> 01:54:09,570
It's called Do Not Download Anything, by the way.

1927
01:54:09,610 --> 01:54:10,550
Do Not Download.

1928
01:54:11,050 --> 01:54:13,870
I would just tell, do not download anything related to the...

1929
01:54:13,870 --> 01:54:15,430
Oh, jenniesmod.com?

1930
01:54:16,390 --> 01:54:17,810
Don't go to the website.

1931
01:54:18,110 --> 01:54:19,210
Don't go to the website.

1932
01:54:19,490 --> 01:54:22,690
Because the real website, the real website...

1933
01:54:22,690 --> 01:54:23,570
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

1934
01:54:26,410 --> 01:54:27,270
It's her bag!

1935
01:54:30,050 --> 01:54:32,530
Do not download anything.

1936
01:54:32,970 --> 01:54:37,390
Because the real creator of the thing got a cease and desist.

1937
01:54:37,890 --> 01:54:44,070
So the only way to obtain it is through very not legal means.

1938
01:54:45,390 --> 01:54:57,090
And there are other websites that would upload viruses with the Genie mod because they know that Gooners are desperate.

1939
01:54:59,230 --> 01:55:03,710
Because the main, the only way to obtain it is to find the developer's Twitter.

1940
01:55:04,130 --> 01:55:07,870
And he would occasionally apparently, because I was reading up about it, because I was curious.

1941
01:55:07,890 --> 01:55:32,270
about this Jenny mod and people were saying yeah sometimes the developer will tweet out about ways to get it but he would delete it really fast so because he hasn't he can't update it at all because he got these sentences from Minecraft and stop oh because it's sexy like yeah because it's it's not just sexy admit it's more than

1942
01:55:41,390 --> 01:55:45,210
Someone put a video Jenny mod in VR

1943
01:55:50,850 --> 01:55:56,810
It's a little It's a little more than just So what virus did you get when you downloaded it?

1944
01:55:57,330 --> 01:56:31,870
So Okay, okay, okay Funny story But I was talking to one of my friends about the Minecraft mod Jenny And then I was like Oh, you should download it And then I accidentally And then I was Are you saying you accidentally don't lie No I actually gave Made the person get spyware Because Because I was like Click that link Because there's free sharing Like which link do I click?

1945
01:56:31,990 --> 01:56:38,750
I was like click that one And then they got spyware And then I got So

1946
01:56:42,420 --> 01:56:52,040
I felt so bad I felt so fucking bad Like I Don't download it.

1947
01:56:52,040 --> 01:56:53,800
Just download McAfee.

1948
01:56:54,700 --> 01:56:56,040
Kind of

1949
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:02,660
disappointed she doesn't look more like Laura Croft.

1950
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:04,560
Don't worry there are other characters apparently.

1951
01:57:05,980 --> 01:57:06,880
There's other characters.

1952
01:57:07,580 --> 01:57:07,700
There are.

1953
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:09,360
There's a slime girl.

1954
01:57:10,640 --> 01:57:11,220
There's a slime.

1955
01:57:11,380 --> 01:57:12,560
Don't download the mod.

1956
01:57:13,020 --> 01:57:14,260
Don't download the mod.

1957
01:57:14,640 --> 01:57:17,140
I don't want you to get- You guys, I do not endorse.

1958
01:57:17,260 --> 01:57:19,140
I don't want anyone to get spyware.

1959
01:57:19,600 --> 01:57:25,220
I don't- I don't- I thought there's...

1960
01:57:25,220 --> 01:57:29,240
Don't download a mod called Jenny Minecraft.

1961
01:57:33,180 --> 01:57:34,780
Do not redeem.

1962
01:57:35,600 --> 01:57:36,960
Do not redeem.

1963
01:57:37,500 --> 01:57:38,500
Do you think it's Enderman?

1964
01:57:38,740 --> 01:57:40,180
It's happening again.

1965
01:57:42,400 --> 01:57:43,920
Do not redeem.

1966
01:57:46,820 --> 01:57:47,300
Okay.

1967
01:57:52,600 --> 01:57:52,780
Okay.

1968
01:57:53,540 --> 01:57:54,560
Oh, it's hard to tell.

1969
01:57:54,580 --> 01:57:57,700
It's hard to tell because he could be a self-insert too.

1970
01:57:57,920 --> 01:58:01,240
I want to trust in my Minecraft crush.

1971
01:58:01,660 --> 01:58:02,580
Your Minecraft crush?

1972
01:58:02,740 --> 01:58:04,120
Your Tumblr sexy man?

1973
01:58:04,280 --> 01:58:04,600
You're going all in.

1974
01:58:04,600 --> 01:58:06,000
Yeah, my Tumblr sexy man.

1975
01:58:07,180 --> 01:58:10,800
Oh, the 2.9 Iron Mouse.

1976
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:12,000
I'm sorry, Iron Mouse.

1977
01:58:12,640 --> 01:58:14,680
You're not sexy enough, apparently.

1978
01:58:16,860 --> 01:58:17,240
You're not.

1979
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:17,740
You're not.

1980
01:58:18,640 --> 01:58:19,160
What?

1981
01:58:19,260 --> 01:58:21,000
These are Tumblr sexy men.

1982
01:58:22,040 --> 01:58:24,400
It has to be a Sukuna, right?

1983
01:58:24,580 --> 01:58:25,680
Oh, it's Sukuna.

1984
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:27,080
Yeah, I think it's Jyotokai.

1985
01:58:27,340 --> 01:58:28,200
Yeah, it's Jyotokai.

1986
01:58:28,580 --> 01:58:29,160
Yeah, it's Jyotokai.

1987
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:31,560
Yeah, it's Jyotokai.

1988
01:58:32,080 --> 01:58:34,940
Yeah, I think it's still Sukuna.

1989
01:58:35,180 --> 01:58:36,160
Is it still Sukuna?

1990
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:36,780
Yeah.

1991
01:58:37,580 --> 01:58:39,120
Guys, we're about to break 10.

1992
01:58:39,240 --> 01:58:40,140
It's been so long.

1993
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:42,480
Wait, but this is like two side characters.

1994
01:58:43,240 --> 01:58:43,960
Oh, that's true.

1995
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:46,540
But she's in My Hero Academia, so she shouldn't.

1996
01:58:46,700 --> 01:58:48,120
Wait, what is she?

1997
01:58:48,460 --> 01:58:50,520
Oh, she's not a Cyclone girl, right?

1998
01:58:51,220 --> 01:58:53,020
I have no idea if she is.

1999
01:58:53,480 --> 01:58:54,060
Why is it?

2000
01:58:54,160 --> 01:58:55,300
Because, like, the cyclone.

2001
01:58:56,200 --> 01:58:58,500
Yeah, isn't she like the girl that's...

2002
01:58:58,500 --> 01:59:03,320
The one that had like, that can create like little cyclones, but like...

2003
01:59:03,320 --> 01:59:04,960
I think it's my hero.

2004
01:59:05,120 --> 01:59:05,340
Yeah.

2005
01:59:05,640 --> 01:59:07,560
Because like, why does she have short hair now?

2006
01:59:08,020 --> 01:59:08,640
I don't know.

2007
01:59:08,780 --> 01:59:09,020
Spoilers?

2008
01:59:09,600 --> 01:59:10,180
Oh, spoiler.

2009
01:59:10,840 --> 01:59:14,400
Yeah, because I was like... Yeah, she's like one of the big... Like, she has like...

2010
01:59:14,400 --> 01:59:16,020
She's part of the, like, the Senpai squad.

2011
01:59:16,240 --> 01:59:16,400
Yeah.

2012
01:59:16,840 --> 01:59:17,040
Yeah, yeah.

2013
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:18,240
Yeah, I remember her long.

2014
01:59:18,400 --> 01:59:18,800
Yeah.

2015
01:59:19,020 --> 01:59:20,240
Yeah, I just think... Okay, this is your forte.

2016
01:59:20,540 --> 01:59:21,160
Oh, my God.

2017
01:59:21,260 --> 01:59:21,560
It's hard.

2018
01:59:21,660 --> 01:59:22,500
Ash is pretty popular.

2019
01:59:24,560 --> 01:59:26,940
that about Valorant girl too.

2020
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:28,620
Because Viper is!

2021
01:59:28,880 --> 01:59:31,580
Wait, but Viper, didn't Viper win?

2022
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:33,600
Was supposed to win that we didn't pick her?

2023
01:59:35,060 --> 01:59:36,040
No, Viper didn't win.

2024
01:59:36,200 --> 01:59:36,980
Oh, Viper didn't win.

2025
01:59:37,120 --> 01:59:37,860
I forgot already.

2026
01:59:38,200 --> 01:59:40,860
That's how little I care about Valorant.

2027
01:59:41,980 --> 01:59:44,940
I think it's Ash, just from the SFM videos.

2028
01:59:46,020 --> 01:59:46,940
I knew it.

2029
01:59:47,220 --> 01:59:47,620
Ash.

2030
01:59:48,060 --> 01:59:48,760
Oh, the way.

2031
01:59:49,160 --> 01:59:50,540
Oh, Palutino.

2032

It absolutely...

2060
02:02:17,920 --> 02:02:19,380

02:02:31,540 --> 02:02:36,800
The hardest decision requires the greatest war, the strongest warriors.

2066
02:02:41,270 --> 02:02:44,110
We need meant to be here.

2067
02:02:45,310 --> 02:02:47,330
Green versus green.

02:02:48,130 --> 02:02:49,690
The man himself.

2069
02:02:50,330 --> 02:02:51,810

We're having a very intense debate right now Midlife Who won the other one?

2074
02:03:25,330 --> 02:03:26,170
Oh, it was Chun-Li.

2075
02:03:26,530 --> 02:03:27,750
Chun-Li, Chun-Li, Chun-Li.

2076
02:03:28,290 --> 02:03:28,330
Yeah.

2077
02:03:29,170 --> 02:03:30,130
It's gotta be Shrek.

2078
02:03:30,810 --> 02:03:31,070
Yeah?

2079
02:03:31,450 --> 02:03:32,390
I think so.

2080
02:03:32,490 --> 02:03:33,290
He's the main character.

2081
02:03:33,590 --> 02:03:34,530
That's true.

2082
02:03:34,850 --> 02:03:35,410
That's true.

2083
02:03:35,830 --> 02:03:37,890
But, like, how many posts would he have?

2084
02:03:38,370 --> 02:03:38,750
2K.

2085
02:03:42,460 --> 02:03:44,420
Where are my Shrek fans?

2086
02:03:44,540 --> 02:03:44,780
What?

2087
02:03:45,460 --> 02:03:46,100
Don't get me.

2088
02:03:46,100 --> 02:03:46,560
Shrek fans!

2089
02:03:46,980 --> 02:03:49,860
I'm plotting my way for the Shrek now.

2090
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:51,640
What?

2091
02:03:52,580 --> 02:03:54,060
There's no way.

2092
02:03:54,380 --> 02:03:54,840
I can't.

2093
02:03:54,860 --> 02:04:55,400
believe it you would think shrek who the fuck is carrot i don't know she's a bunny girl she's a bunny girl just because oh my god she's a very important bunny girl oh my god sarja sarja she's so important apparently yeah oh yeah fate the franchise yeah uh still fate still fate yes i'm 801 75 745 she holds the entire Resident Evil franchise this is hard I think it's Konosuba though I feel like it like it's popular yeah there's a bunch of popular characters yeah thank god that's kind of close though oh but it's still Konosuba yeah I was gonna say I don't think there's enough enough up oh my god but it's Gojo okay thank god there's not enough um masu I I think it's oh this is This is hard.

2094
02:04:55,880 --> 02:04:56,840
Masuo is like a...

2095
02:04:56,840 --> 02:04:58,480
She's a very popular character.

2096
02:04:59,800 --> 02:05:00,420
Is that...

2097
02:05:00,420 --> 02:05:01,980
I think it's her.

2098
02:05:02,160 --> 02:05:03,940
But is she more special than Glojo?

2099
02:05:04,500 --> 02:05:05,380
I think it's Masuo.

2100
02:05:05,760 --> 02:05:05,800
But he is special.

2101
02:05:05,940 --> 02:05:06,280
Special.

2102
02:05:07,320 --> 02:05:07,840
Oh, yeah.

2103
02:05:08,380 --> 02:05:09,380
Oh, yeah.

2104
02:05:09,580 --> 02:05:10,080
He's not special.

2105
02:05:10,100 --> 02:05:10,840
Oh, Catra.

2106
02:05:13,840 --> 02:05:15,260
Oh, that's hard.

2107
02:05:15,460 --> 02:05:16,100
I don't know.

2108
02:05:16,240 --> 02:05:16,600
I don't...

2109
02:05:16,600 --> 02:05:19,660
I don't think Catra has a big enough fandom, though.

2110
02:05:20,120 --> 02:05:20,880
That's the thing.

2111
02:05:21,640 --> 02:05:22,560
I don't know, Shira.

2112
02:05:22,880 --> 02:05:24,060
I watched this series.

2113
02:05:24,200 --> 02:05:24,840
It was pretty decent.

2114
02:05:25,420 --> 02:05:38,280

2117
02:05:59,100 --> 02:05:59,120
What

2118
02:06:04,610 --> 02:06:05,490
do you mean?

2119
02:06:05,850 --> 02:06:07,210
Tails alone was...

2120
02:06:09,540 --> 02:06:10,420
It's Knuckles.

2121
02:06:10,980 --> 02:06:11,920
Come on.

2122
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:13,140
Look at his fist.

2123
02:06:13,560 --> 02:06:14,820
They're shaped like nipples.

2124
02:06:16,900 --> 02:06:17,360
It's not...

2125
02:06:17,360 --> 02:06:18,620
Look at Knuckles' fist!

2126
02:06:19,120 --> 02:06:21,180
It's really nipple shaped!

2127
02:06:21,880 --> 02:06:25,500
Oh, have you seen the nipple comic from Knuckles?

2128
02:06:26,600 --> 02:06:28,320
No, I don't know what you're talking about.

2129
02:06:28,320 --> 02:06:28,980
Okay, don't worry.

2130
02:06:29,220 --> 02:06:29,420
Don't worry.

2131
02:06:29,660 --> 02:06:30,880
All right, let me show you.

2132
02:06:31,580 --> 02:06:32,180
This...

2133
02:06:32,180 --> 02:06:32,340
Okay.

2134
02:06:32,680 --> 02:06:35,260
After reading this comic, I'll give you a little fun fact.

2135
02:06:36,720 --> 02:06:37,160
Oh, God.

2136
02:06:39,660 --> 02:06:40,480
Does he chuckle?

2137
02:06:41,400 --> 02:06:44,040
I'll give you a little fun fact about this comic.

2138
02:06:49,520 --> 02:06:50,600
But basically...

2139
02:06:51,780 --> 02:06:52,320
After...

2140
02:06:53,060 --> 02:06:53,600
After...

2141
02:06:53,600 --> 02:06:55,060
The artists...

2142
02:06:55,060 --> 02:06:55,780
Who...

2143
02:06:55,780 --> 02:06:58,680
The artists who did this comic...

2144
02:06:59,320 --> 02:07:02,480
End up officially illustrating Sonic art.

2145
02:07:03,660 --> 02:07:04,500
For...

2146
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:07,800
Oh!

2147
02:07:12,660 --> 02:07:13,400
For Sega.

2148
02:07:14,580 --> 02:07:17,000
No, it was before...

2149
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:18,680
Before he became...

2150
02:07:19,320 --> 02:07:20,620
He became... So it's canon.

2151
02:07:21,040 --> 02:07:21,700
Technically it's canon.

2152
02:07:22,400 --> 02:07:23,640
I wouldn't say that.

2153
02:07:24,140 --> 02:07:25,940
He's an official Sonic artist.

2154
02:07:26,520 --> 02:07:27,880
Dreams do come true!

2155
02:07:28,440 --> 02:07:30,220
Dreams do come true.

2156
02:07:30,900 --> 02:07:32,660
Dreams do come true.

2157
02:07:32,680 --> 02:07:34,140
Come true.

2158
02:07:36,240 --> 02:07:36,740
Oh.

2159
02:07:38,400 --> 02:07:39,300
Oh, I don't.

2160
02:07:39,400 --> 02:07:39,980
I don't know.

2161
02:07:40,460 --> 02:07:41,400
Okay, delete it.

2162
02:07:41,880 --> 02:07:44,580
Wait, I remember the guy was going to report this message.

2163
02:07:44,940 --> 02:07:45,200
Delete it.

2164
02:07:45,420 --> 02:07:45,980
What do you mean?

2165
02:07:46,760 --> 02:07:48,900
You're going to report my message?

2166
02:07:50,240 --> 02:07:52,040
I'm going to say this entire franchise, Miku.

2167
02:07:52,740 --> 02:07:54,000
Because I would have had to name Miku.

2168
02:07:54,020 --> 02:07:55,760
He was like 21k.

2169
02:07:56,880 --> 02:07:57,380
Miku.

2170
02:07:58,900 --> 02:07:59,400

2171
02:07:59,960 --> 02:08:00,460

I still think Higurashi.

2203
02:10:15,550 --> 02:10:16,750
There's a lot of characters in this.

2204
02:10:16,750 --> 02:10:17,450
That's true.

2205
02:10:17,990 --> 02:10:21,650
Yeah, all the characters combined only is half of...

2206
02:10:22,290 --> 02:10:23,790
That's... Oh, it has to be Rey.

2207
02:10:24,550 --> 02:10:25,070
Right!

2208
02:10:25,710 --> 02:10:26,670
It's gotta be Rey.

2209
02:10:27,230 --> 02:10:28,190
Yeah, she was OG Guder.

2210
02:10:28,730 --> 02:10:29,250
Yeah.

2211
02:10:29,770 --> 02:10:31,070
She's like the OG waifu.

2212
02:10:31,190 --> 02:10:31,630
There's no way.

2213
02:10:31,870 --> 02:10:36,790
It's a good show that they cancelled after the first season because I think it was an inside job.

2214
02:10:37,050 --> 02:10:40,690
I think they got too close to the truth and then the government cancelled them.

2215
02:10:40,850 --> 02:10:42,310
It was such a good show.

2216
02:10:42,630 --> 02:10:46,030
But it was basically like talking about the Illuminati and everything.

2217
02:10:47,670 --> 02:11:02,380
to the truth no i thought my guy would beat inside job how many we were so close

2218
02:11:07,320 --> 02:11:24,480
so no they didn't have a second season they divide the first season in half and then said it's the second season so the entire two seasons was from the first season there's no way it's courage right i'd be very i don't think so but yeah i was gonna say It's our first thing,

2219
02:11:24,520 --> 02:11:24,960
it's fine.

2220
02:11:25,200 --> 02:11:25,740
DuckTales.

2221
02:11:26,340 --> 02:11:26,820
DuckTales.

2222
02:11:27,200 --> 02:11:27,380
Ooh.

2223
02:11:29,830 --> 02:11:32,320
Tiny Toons Adventure or DuckTales?

2224
02:11:32,700 --> 02:11:34,180
I think it's Tiny Toon.

2225
02:11:34,340 --> 02:11:35,620
Because there's more characters.

2226
02:11:38,160 --> 02:11:39,260
Okay, you're right.

2227
02:11:39,440 --> 02:11:41,880
Because I was like thinking there's more Looney characters.

2228
02:11:42,400 --> 02:11:43,340
Murder drones.

2229
02:11:43,920 --> 02:11:47,000
I mean, it's from the same franchise that did.

2230
02:11:48,240 --> 02:11:49,440
What is Murder Drones?

2231
02:11:49,860 --> 02:11:52,780
Well, it's from Glitch Productions who did the...

2232
02:11:53,480 --> 02:11:54,960
Oh, like a digital circus.

2233
02:11:55,160 --> 02:11:55,740
Yeah, digital circus.

2234
02:11:55,780 --> 02:11:57,960
They did digital circus, but I don't know if they're that popular.

2235
02:11:58,600 --> 02:11:59,080
I don't think...

2236
02:11:59,080 --> 02:12:00,500
If it were digital circus, I think.

2237
02:12:00,620 --> 02:12:03,700
But Tiny Toons, I think, is still winning here.

2238
02:12:04,120 --> 02:12:06,540
Oh, I guess we're wrong.

2239
02:12:06,940 --> 02:12:09,860
I guess it has to be Hasbun Hotel.

2240
02:12:10,340 --> 02:12:12,000
You could just be there as a side character.

2241
02:12:12,240 --> 02:12:13,860
I don't know these guys.

2242
02:12:14,800 --> 02:12:15,740
I think it's the JoJo's.

2243
02:12:16,280 --> 02:12:16,740
Is it?

2244
02:12:18,860 --> 02:12:19,660
Oh, just...

2245
02:12:21,800 --> 02:12:22,720
It's Dragon Ball.

2246
02:12:23,620 --> 02:12:24,140
Kefla?

2247
02:12:24,560 --> 02:12:24,960
Kefla?

2248
02:12:25,440 --> 02:12:27,280
She was pretty popular in the newer ones.

2249
02:12:27,760 --> 02:12:28,040
Mm-hmm.

2250
02:12:28,380 --> 02:12:33,100
Oh, and, oh, it's from all of Dragon Ball because she was in the newer Dragon Ball series.

2251
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:34,740
So she should be.

2252
02:12:34,920 --> 02:12:35,180
Yeah.

2253
02:12:35,760 --> 02:12:36,440
Yeah, yeah.

2254
02:12:37,060 --> 02:12:38,640
Kiriko, I remember.

2255
02:12:39,340 --> 02:12:39,500
No.

2256
02:12:40,520 --> 02:12:42,100
We've fucked up so much.

2257
02:12:42,120 --> 02:12:43,420
Wait, versus Sanji?

2258
02:12:43,800 --> 02:12:44,320
Sanji?

2259
02:12:44,600 --> 02:12:45,920
Okay, but SFM.

2260
02:12:45,940 --> 02:12:46,980
I think it's still Kiriko.

2261
02:12:46,980 --> 02:12:48,140
I think it's still Kiriko.

2262
02:12:48,440 --> 02:12:51,680
I think, like, Sanji not as popular.

2263
02:12:51,680 --> 02:13:02,880
Brawl stars Bro, it's a mobile game Are people trying Or in a mobile game still I mean Yeah

2264
02:13:06,560 --> 02:13:23,480
Should be Sanji right Yes Oh my god that was so close That was close Sanji Oh Valorant Right That's the entire Valorant Yeah It's kind of popular Oh shit I don't think I don't think that, bro.

2265
02:13:24,580 --> 02:13:25,260
I don't know, actually.

2266
02:13:25,300 --> 02:13:27,400
I don't know, because Vegeta...

2267
02:13:27,960 --> 02:13:30,160
He's so beta, too, so to say.

2268
02:13:30,280 --> 02:13:30,720
What?

2269
02:13:31,520 --> 02:13:32,740
What do you mean?

2270
02:13:33,600 --> 02:13:35,800
What the fucking takes care of Vegeta?

2271
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:38,460
What do you mean?

2272
02:13:38,460 --> 02:13:39,620
I want to believe in Vegeta.

2273
02:13:43,360 --> 02:13:44,400
Doki, please.

2274
02:13:46,360 --> 02:13:48,460
He is not beta.

2275
02:13:49,100 --> 02:13:50,020
He's got...

2276
02:13:50,020 --> 02:13:50,180
No!

2277
02:13:53,600 --> 02:14:16,820
he's he's a male wife he is he's a male wife he's a he is 100 a male way like both he's literally boba like literally takes care of him like a like a chia pet no i honestly i think it's still valorant i think it's valorant too he's just he's a short king but she doesn't lose

2278
02:14:23,260 --> 02:14:29,140
I only would not say Vegeta because guys just don't get as big of numbers on here.

2279
02:14:32,220 --> 02:14:33,600
I'm so cute.

2280
02:14:33,940 --> 02:14:35,460
Cooking Vegeta.

2281
02:14:36,900 --> 02:14:37,900
Jobbed again.

2282
02:14:38,260 --> 02:14:41,140
Vegeta has jobbed in so many times.

2283
02:14:41,540 --> 02:14:45,440
You can't self-insert as Vegeta because nobody could be him.

2284
02:14:47,220 --> 02:14:50,320
Because nobody can be the prince of all Saiyans, am I right?

2285
02:14:56,050 --> 02:15:25,690
It has to be The slander to my boy Vegeta It has to be I love what I love No I would I refuse No this is my No I refused I No You keep doing this You keep doing this You can't No no You keep doing this You just You see Sonic and you Instinctively push it!

2287
02:15:28,930 --> 02:15:29,930
It's Sonic!

2288
02:15:30,130 --> 02:15:30,690
Charizard!

2289
02:15:31,150 --> 02:15:31,730
Charizard!

2290
02:15:33,330 --> 02:15:34,550
I can't help it!

2291
02:15:34,830 --> 02:15:35,690
Dengun Rampa.

2292
02:15:36,810 --> 02:15:38,390
There's so many characters in Dengun.

2293
02:15:38,510 --> 02:15:39,790
Okay, Dengun Rampa.

2294
02:15:40,590 --> 02:15:41,450

I'm doing it.

2298
02:15:44,650 --> 02:15:46,330
I think it's still Viper.

2299
02:15:46,510 --> 02:15:47,430
I don't know that character.

2300
02:15:47,610 --> 02:15:48,210
That fake character.

2301
02:15:49,390 --> 02:15:50,970
I don't know that character either.

2302
02:15:51,410 --> 02:15:52,170

Why did you see?

2310
02:17:06,690 --> 02:17:10,050
Did you go to R34 and see?

2311
02:17:12,190 --> 02:17:12,950
Did you go?

2312
02:17:17,530 --> 02:17:20,670

2317
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:39,620
There's no way Haxiris is gonna be kidding through this.

2318
02:18:40,480 --> 02:18:41,580
I mean from Honkai?

2319
02:18:42,020 --> 02:18:43,340
I don't even know if she's popular.

2320
02:18:43,400 --> 02:18:44,020
I don't know.

2321
02:18:44,340 --> 02:18:47,550
Every last time we draw.

2322
02:18:48,270 --> 02:18:49,270
It has to be.

2323
02:18:49,770 --> 02:18:49,770
No!

2324
02:18:50,310 --> 02:18:50,310

02:18:53,510 --> 02:18:54,110
By nine.

2328
02:18:55,110 --> 02:18:56,010
Marie Rose.

2329
02:18:56,370 --> 02:18:56,790
Marie Rose.

2330
02:18:57,210 --> 02:18:57,830
Marie Rose, yeah.

I mean a hundred easy.

2332
02:18:59,310 --> 02:19:00,170
How does she have less?

2333
02:19:00,370 --> 02:19:02,130
Did you see that she has less than?

2334
02:19:02,210 --> 02:19:07,310
Don't she has less than I'm sick of seeing I want to try.

2335
02:19:07,690 --> 02:19:09,930
I never want to see this fucker again.

2336
02:19:10,430 --> 02:19:12,810
No, but the other guy...

2337
02:19:12,810 --> 02:19:15,070
Oh my god, Kirito for the self-insome.

2338
02:19:15,890 --> 02:19:18,190
But the other guy had less...

2339
02:19:18,190 --> 02:19:22,350
She had less than Captain Price.

2340
02:19:22,850 --> 02:19:24,370
Like, I don't understand.

2341
02:19:25,270 --> 02:19:27,110
Why did she have less than other person?

2342
02:19:27,290 --> 02:19:29,750
Who is it?

2343
02:19:29,830 --> 02:19:30,350
Who had less?

2344
02:19:30,650 --> 02:19:34,210
The other girl that was against Marie Rose.

2345
02:19:34,450 --> 02:19:36,430
She had 144, but Captain Price...

2346
02:19:36,450 --> 02:20:07,970
price out of 334 i don't understand what is captain it's great skull it's okay yeah it was not i think kirito is i think kirito just has a lot of self-insert i think marine was more popular yeah it was the other one not pearl but the other girl yeah that had more sakura only because she's a main character like you might hate her but oh oh there's There's not enough V superfans.

2347
02:20:08,150 --> 02:20:09,450
Yeah, I was going to say there's not enough...

2348
02:20:09,450 --> 02:20:09,650

2349
02:20:10,050 --> 02:20:10,410

Oh, Steinsgate, though.

2355
02:20:18,890 --> 02:20:19,830
This one's hard.

2356
02:20:19,970 --> 02:20:20,710
Probably Steinsgate.

2357
02:20:21,030 --> 02:20:22,470
I just say...

2358
02:20:22,470 --> 02:20:22,710

I'm quitting this game.

2366
02:20:32,630 --> 02:20:33,890
I'm quitting this game.

2367
02:20:38,960 --> 02:20:39,540

2374
02:24:20,900 --> 02:24:24,560
You are still on Captain Price?

2375
02:24:25,040 --> 02:24:25,940
Because I'm saying

2376
02:24:38,150 --> 02:24:39,790
exactly how many he had.

2377
02:24:39,790 --> 02:24:41,850
That's how I was, it was trauma.

2378
02:24:43,230 --> 02:24:45,490
It's ingrained in my head.

2379
02:24:46,190 --> 02:24:48,330
I think, I don't know actually, I have no idea.

2380
02:24:49,270 --> 02:24:51,330
I think Veroni Kenshin.

2381
02:24:52,990 --> 02:24:54,590
But it's fate though.

2382
02:24:55,290 --> 02:24:57,910
Yeah, but I've never heard of her.

2383
02:24:58,630 --> 02:25:00,550
Oh, oh, you're right.

2384
02:25:00,570 --> 02:25:01,190
That's good.

2385
02:25:01,330 --> 02:25:02,090
If you never heard of

2386
02:25:06,600 --> 02:25:08,260
Who's that over there?

2387
02:25:08,640 --> 02:25:10,220
Who's that over there?

2388
02:25:14,130 --> 02:25:15,390
You clear her, right?

2389
02:25:15,510 --> 02:25:17,210
That would be so sad if you don't.

2390
02:25:17,470 --> 02:25:20,150
You're like, I don't even know where and she beats you.

2391
02:25:20,390 --> 02:25:21,330
That would be so sad.

2392
02:25:21,430 --> 02:25:22,090
I don't know.

2393
02:25:22,290 --> 02:25:22,650
Oh, shit.

2394
02:25:22,990 --> 02:25:24,990
400 and 408.

2395
02:25:35,320 --> 02:25:37,860
I'm sorry, but...

2396
02:25:37,860 --> 02:25:39,460
I can't wait to get through.

2397
02:25:39,480 --> 02:25:41,960
I don't think you win.

2398
02:25:42,140 --> 02:25:44,860
I can't win against the Goomba!

2399
02:25:46,180 --> 02:25:47,400
I mean, look at him.

2400
02:25:47,840 --> 02:25:48,880
Is he...

2401
02:25:51,580 --> 02:25:52,600
I'm sorry.

2402
02:25:53,160 --> 02:25:55,060
I think the Goomba clears you, Min.

2403
02:25:55,180 --> 02:25:55,980
I'm sorry.

2404
02:25:56,440 --> 02:25:57,680
Oh, by a lot, too.

2405
02:25:57,780 --> 02:25:59,420
There's a lot of Goomba.

2406
02:25:59,680 --> 02:26:01,180
I mean, look at his shape.

2407
02:26:01,420 --> 02:26:01,760
I know.

2408
02:26:02,120 --> 02:26:05,420
I'm just saying the shape alone makes it.

2409
02:26:05,440 --> 02:26:07,120
The matchup of the century.

2410
02:26:07,320 --> 02:26:07,540
I get it.

2411
02:26:07,660 --> 02:26:08,240
I understand.

2412
02:26:09,620 --> 02:26:11,500
Yeah, the Goomba...

2413
02:26:11,500 --> 02:26:15,260
Against any other character, though, like, it has to be a Goomba.

2414
02:26:16,720 --> 02:26:18,860
And it's like, we never got it before, dude.

2415
02:26:18,900 --> 02:26:23,320
The very first time the Goomba shows up, it was your matchup.

2416
02:26:23,620 --> 02:26:24,780
That's crazy.

2417
02:26:25,400 --> 02:26:29,340
Maybe I should draw myself more like a Goomba.

2418
02:26:29,660 --> 02:26:31,480
These people will find me more appealing.

2419
02:26:31,780 --> 02:26:34,580
I admit it to all the Goomba drawings on the side.

2420
02:26:34,660 --> 02:26:37,580
Like, he can be, like, the guy that's just there.

2421
02:26:39,540 --> 02:26:40,060
model.

2422
02:26:40,480 --> 02:26:43,980
Yes, and they can add you to the Goomba category.

2423
02:26:44,600 --> 02:26:47,140
They'll have to add Goomba to your tag.

2424
02:26:47,860 --> 02:26:48,260
Yeah.

2425
02:26:48,660 --> 02:26:50,840
I mean, I already have one tooth, one bang tooth.

2426
02:26:51,900 --> 02:26:53,900
I can have two going up.

2427
02:26:54,240 --> 02:26:57,280
For Halloween, you should dress up like a Goomba.

2428
02:26:58,120 --> 02:27:00,120
Okay, that is going to be so sexy.

2429
02:27:00,240 --> 02:27:01,780
I beat Captain Bryce.

2430
02:27:02,960 --> 02:27:04,520
You know how I have Garfield?

2431
02:27:04,760 --> 02:27:05,920
You can have Goomba.

2432
02:27:07,260 --> 02:27:09,200
Wait, we haven't gotten Garfield yet.

2433
02:27:09,480 --> 02:27:13,100
We got Goomba, but now we got Dead Company.

2434
02:27:13,480 --> 02:27:13,780
Yikes.

2435
02:27:19,550 --> 02:27:23,730
Okay, this is your field of interest, so I...

2436
02:27:23,730 --> 02:27:24,790
Leave it to you.

2437
02:27:24,950 --> 02:27:26,470
Okay, this is hard.

2438
02:27:28,530 --> 02:27:29,010
Because...

2439
02:27:29,010 --> 02:27:31,870
Zenyano's not that popular, but...

2440
02:27:31,870 --> 02:27:32,570
I think...

2441
02:27:32,570 --> 02:27:34,110
But then SFM videos.

2442
02:27:34,590 --> 02:27:35,510
Also, I don't know why.

2443
02:27:35,670 --> 02:27:36,270
He's barking.

2444
02:27:36,410 --> 02:27:38,970
I don't know why he's, like, faked something.

2445
02:27:39,230 --> 02:27:39,510
I don't know.

2446
02:27:44,750 --> 02:27:45,550
Oh, I...

2447
02:27:45,570 --> 02:27:46,450
feel like Goomba.

2448
02:27:46,750 --> 02:27:47,030
I don't know.

2449
02:27:47,110 --> 02:27:49,690
The SMM videos might include Zenyata too.

2450
02:27:50,090 --> 02:27:50,650
That's the thing.

2451
02:27:50,750 --> 02:27:51,610
We are at 11.

2452
02:27:51,710 --> 02:27:52,530
Oh, this is risky.

2453
02:27:52,530 --> 02:27:53,750
Oh, this is, oh, yeah.

2454
02:27:53,850 --> 02:28:00,910
It's always the SMM videos that, it's always the SMM videos that basically clutches it up, but I think I'm gonna go with Goomba.

2455
02:28:01,130 --> 02:28:01,770
I think it's Goomba.

2456
02:28:02,030 --> 02:28:02,610
Oh, thank God.

2457
02:28:02,990 --> 02:28:03,470
160.

2458
02:28:03,990 --> 02:28:05,490
Yeah, you got more than Zenyata.

2459
02:28:05,990 --> 02:28:07,890
I got more than Zenyata, Buren.

2460
02:28:08,490 --> 02:28:11,730
Yeah, like, David versus Goliath right here.

2461
02:28:12,410 --> 02:28:13,550
Did you know who this is?

2462
02:28:14,070 --> 02:28:47,030
She is a popular character but i still think it's free rune yeah i was gonna say if you're in just from just fearin alone yeah it has to be led right but he's also not written yeah it's not written that's the thing but miku had like what 20k or something like that i feel like i want to feel like it's len because vocaloid yeah but but he's also a guy yeah exactly exactly he's awful a guy He's also a guy.

2463
02:28:47,190 --> 02:28:47,970
Oh, thank God.

2464
02:28:48,310 --> 02:28:48,770
Just barely.

2465
02:28:49,090 --> 02:28:49,790
Just barely.

2466
02:28:50,510 --> 02:28:50,710
Rink it.

2467
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:10,060
All I'm saying is that you gotta have a specific IQ to understand this franchise.

2468
02:29:10,460 --> 02:29:11,400
So I don't know.

2469
02:29:13,120 --> 02:29:14,180
Yeah, I have a particular IQ.

2470
02:29:14,180 --> 02:29:16,320
But you don't have to have an IQ to be horny.

2471
02:29:20,500 --> 02:29:25,160
I want to feel like it's Rink and Morty just because the show is so popular.

2472
02:29:25,680 --> 02:29:27,120
But I don't know.

2473
02:29:27,400 --> 02:29:58,760
I mean I guess the the mom I I don't know there's the there's I don't know I mean Pickle Rick was pretty good No it wasn't Pickle Rick was pretty good I like it's a classic though it is a classic I think since this site is more western we gotta go Rick and Morty your final answer.

2474
02:30:01,240 --> 02:30:02,860
Oh, my gosh.

2475
02:30:04,460 --> 02:30:05,320
Oh, my.

2476
02:30:05,320 --> 02:30:06,400
It was Rick and Morty.

2477
02:30:06,540 --> 02:30:06,860
I remember.

2478
02:30:07,020 --> 02:30:08,320
Courage did not clear.

2479
02:30:08,580 --> 02:30:09,740
Yeah, Courage did not clear.

2480
02:30:09,820 --> 02:30:10,760
Oh, my God.

2481
02:30:10,840 --> 02:30:11,660
There's no way.

2482
02:30:11,880 --> 02:30:13,400
There's no way.

2483
02:30:13,840 --> 02:30:15,640
Like, everyone went crazy.

2484
02:30:15,760 --> 02:30:16,840
Oh, Shy Guy.

2485
02:30:17,760 --> 02:30:19,280
Look, the Goomba had 2K.

2486
02:30:19,380 --> 02:30:21,780
So there's no way Shy Guy clears over Goomba.

2487
02:30:22,880 --> 02:30:23,320
There's no.

2488
02:30:23,540 --> 02:30:24,000
Oh, thank God.

2489
02:30:24,180 --> 02:30:24,360
Okay, cool.

2490
02:30:24,680 --> 02:30:27,380
The Shy Guy is 1,100.

2491
02:30:29,480 --> 02:30:59,200
greekul she's in two games so she has two different outfits and she's also well i guess that i don't know if they would count we're at 19 if we get this right we end the pressure is on this is this is the this is it if we get this we are freed oh no oh no no no no i don't know This is a game winning shot.

2492
02:30:59,320 --> 02:31:00,720
We're on overtime, man.

2493
02:31:01,200 --> 02:31:02,100
We're on overtime.

2494
02:31:02,500 --> 02:31:04,020
The ball is in your hand.

2495
02:31:04,600 --> 02:31:05,700
You have a three-point.

2496
02:31:05,820 --> 02:31:06,760
You have a two-point.

2497
02:31:06,760 --> 02:31:09,700
You got a penalty shot right here.

2498
02:31:11,520 --> 02:31:12,960
I don't know, though.

2499
02:31:17,060 --> 02:31:18,820
I don't know either.

2500
02:31:19,640 --> 02:31:20,740
And chat is also toward.

2501
02:31:20,940 --> 02:31:21,680
I have no idea.

2502
02:31:22,180 --> 02:31:22,900
Chat doesn't know.

2503
02:31:23,140 --> 02:31:24,660
Wait, why don't we let chat decide?

2504
02:31:24,760 --> 02:31:25,440
We put up a poll.

2505
02:31:25,460 --> 02:31:26,420
We put up a poll.

2506
02:31:26,580 --> 02:31:27,380
Yeah, but then they're going to vote.

2507
02:31:27,400 --> 02:31:31,760
the wrong answer because he wanted us to keep going you're right you're going to so sabotage us

2508
02:31:34,860 --> 02:31:37,420

Oh, I remember her.

2514

Fuck, but is she popular enough?

2515
02:32:09,260 --> 02:32:09,920
I don't know.

2516
02:32:10,100 --> 02:32:10,920
I don't know.

2517
02:32:12,580 --> 02:32:13,700
Oh, my God.

2518
02:32:14,100 --> 02:32:15,460
Sephiroth is a man, though.

2519
02:32:15,560 --> 02:32:17,840
Someone says, Sephiroth only had 1,500.

2520
02:32:18,360 --> 02:32:20,060
He had the man deep up.

2521
02:32:20,400 --> 02:32:21,680
I mean, Vegeta job.

2522
02:32:21,780 --> 02:32:23,060
Do you remember that, guys?

2523
02:32:23,200 --> 02:32:24,800
Vegeta lost again.

2524
02:32:28,340 --> 02:32:30,120
Oh, I don't know.

2525
02:32:30,280 --> 02:32:32,420
She is really popular, but, like, I don't know.

2526
02:32:33,480 --> 02:32:34,380
We don't do a poll.

2527
02:32:34,520 --> 02:32:35,960
We know yourself that sabotages.

2528
02:32:36,540 --> 02:32:37,580
You want us to keep going.

2529
02:32:37,660 --> 02:32:38,200
This is it.

2530
02:32:38,260 --> 02:32:40,340
This is the game-winning shot.

2531
02:32:41,340 --> 02:32:41,920
Oh, my God.

2532
02:32:41,940 --> 02:32:43,000
I don't know.

2533
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:45,900
Because Shy Guy has a thousand hundred.

2534
02:32:45,940 --> 02:32:48,060
Why does Shy Guy have so much?

2535
02:32:48,380 --> 02:32:49,200
What is he doing?

2536
02:32:49,200 --> 02:32:51,280
Apparently, there's also a girl version of Shy Guy.

2537
02:32:51,480 --> 02:32:53,040
Oh, of course there is.

2538
02:32:53,060 --> 02:32:54,980
There's always a girl version.

2539
02:32:56,700 --> 02:33:02,000
We can't do girl biases because there's a shy girl, but apparently so-called shy guy.

2540
02:33:02,040 --> 02:33:04,080
No, no, I don't know.

2541
02:33:05,180 --> 02:33:08,540
Oh, I don't know.

2542
02:33:09,260 --> 02:33:10,740
I want to say Riku.

2543
02:33:11,260 --> 02:33:11,600
Riku?

2544
02:33:12,960 --> 02:33:13,780
All right.

2545
02:33:14,300 --> 02:33:15,380
Final answer.

2546
02:33:16,560 --> 02:33:16,840
Yeah.

2547
02:33:22,670 --> 02:33:23,930
Show it, show it.

2548
02:33:24,050 --> 02:33:25,230
Scroll up, scroll up.

2549
02:33:25,590 --> 02:33:27,050
We did it!

2550
02:33:27,970 --> 02:33:29,190
All right, we do until we...

2551
02:33:29,210 --> 02:34:34,210

2552
02:34:35,530 --> 02:34:35,790
Oh, wait.

2553
02:34:35,890 --> 02:34:36,590
Scroll down a little.

2554
02:34:36,830 --> 02:34:37,350
Scroll down.

2555
02:34:37,630 --> 02:34:38,090
Oh, yeah, here.

2556
02:34:38,150 --> 02:34:38,590
There you go.

2557
02:34:38,830 --> 02:34:38,910
Yeah.

2558
02:34:39,790 --> 02:34:40,290
Diana.

2559
02:34:41,750 --> 02:34:43,070
Guys, which one?

2560
02:34:44,690 --> 02:34:45,130
Captain Price.

2561
02:34:45,310 --> 02:34:47,670
There's no way it's Captain Price.

2562
02:34:48,390 --> 02:34:48,970
Captain Price.

2563
02:34:49,690 --> 02:34:51,230
Okay, Captain Price.

2564
02:34:51,890 --> 02:34:52,570
Oh, my God.

2565
02:34:52,790 --> 02:34:54,150
Someone uploaded.

2566
02:34:54,430 --> 02:34:54,850
There's no.

2567
02:34:54,930 --> 02:34:55,810
Okay, he was zero.

2568
02:34:56,050 --> 02:34:56,490
There's no.

2569
02:34:56,990 --> 02:34:58,130
Someone uploaded.

2570
02:35:06,080 --> 02:35:32,640
say that someone uploaded three more pictures for Captain Price while we were playing this game because it was not 337 it went the last time who did this who did this who did this who added who did this who did this who did this who did this why did you include my dog into this picture

2571
02:35:36,080 --> 02:35:37,800
the dog in the text

2572
02:35:41,120 --> 02:35:43,680
I think it's you it's me?

2573
02:35:44,280 --> 02:35:45,280
Yeah, I think it's you.

2574
02:35:45,980 --> 02:35:45,980
Yeah.

2575
02:35:46,160 --> 02:35:49,620
But like I feel, is it?

2576
02:35:50,460 --> 02:35:51,280
Yeah, I think it's you.

2577
02:35:51,380 --> 02:35:51,980
Is it real?

2578
02:35:52,060 --> 02:35:54,140
Okay, okay, we'll go with me.

2579
02:35:55,460 --> 02:35:56,060
Oh yeah, no.

2580
02:35:56,260 --> 02:35:56,620
Oh, nice.

2581
02:35:56,880 --> 02:35:58,000
Wait, did you see the number?

2582
02:35:58,480 --> 02:35:58,860
Nice.

2583
02:35:59,100 --> 02:35:59,420
Yeah.

2584
02:36:00,400 --> 02:36:00,880
Yeah.

2585
02:36:01,420 --> 02:36:01,880
Nice.

2586
02:36:03,780 --> 02:36:04,660
Oh, wait.

2587
02:36:04,900 --> 02:36:05,660
Alphys, maybe.

2588
02:36:08,200 --> 02:36:34,860
Susie had like a lot But Alphys she did have a lot But Alphys is like You're just going to motivate your whist To upload more down rule 34 now That's okay I don't need it Like we must try harder now See that's what I'm saying The less you show The least bit offended The less you show The more you get

2589
02:36:39,020 --> 02:37:05,980
Susie's a main character or maybe Susie then A lot of people Like Alphys but maybe Susie Go with Susie Susie Oh Cause she's newer Jess Better Dr. Eggman Bro Okay but bro Check out I mean Look at Dr. Eggman though He's a built I honestly think it's Dr. Eggman.

2590
02:37:06,020 --> 02:37:09,540
I feel like it'd be, I don't know, because it's Disney, too.

2591
02:37:10,680 --> 02:37:12,040
But it's Sonic.

2592
02:37:12,280 --> 02:37:12,860
You're going against.

2593
02:37:13,220 --> 02:37:13,680
Sonic, remember?

2594
02:37:13,880 --> 02:37:14,840
It is Sonic.

2595
02:37:14,980 --> 02:37:16,740
Yeah, always pick Sonic.

2596
02:37:17,780 --> 02:37:18,420
Eggman clears.

2597
02:37:18,540 --> 02:37:19,260
There's no way.

2598
02:37:19,400 --> 02:37:20,840
There's no way!

2599
02:37:23,160 --> 02:37:27,300
Okay, Jasmine apparently did some, had something for people.

2600
02:37:27,440 --> 02:37:28,000
I don't know why.

2601
02:37:28,100 --> 02:37:30,500
Maybe she was a lot of childhood crushes, you know.

2602
02:37:30,540 --> 02:37:31,400
That's true.

2603
02:37:31,740 --> 02:37:32,680
Like, who was it?

2604
02:37:32,700 --> 02:37:34,220
That was your childhood crush?

2605
02:37:34,740 --> 02:38:04,320

2607
02:38:36,740 --> 02:38:38,660
It can't be it!

2608
02:38:39,320 --> 02:38:40,580
It can't be!

2609
02:38:41,060 --> 02:38:42,900
Oh thank god!

2610
02:38:43,620 --> 02:38:46,620
Imagine it was Stormy Albatross.

2611
02:38:49,320 --> 02:38:52,720
We were playing Stormy Albatross fans!

2612
02:38:53,380 --> 02:38:54,480
We're hot in there!

2613
02:38:54,520 --> 02:38:56,780
Why are we a dying species?

2614
02:38:57,140 --> 02:38:57,720
I don't understand.

2615
02:38:58,060 --> 02:38:59,700
You don't even know it!

2616
02:38:59,900 --> 02:39:03,940
As a new Storm fan, I demand more.

2617
02:39:04,740 --> 02:39:07,160
She's in the roll 30 port tag.

2618
02:39:10,960 --> 02:39:11,940
Android Android 18.

2619
02:39:12,340 --> 02:39:14,240
And has to be 18, though.

2620
02:39:14,380 --> 02:39:16,000
I feel like it's Android 18.

2621
02:39:16,100 --> 02:39:16,900
She's like one.

2622
02:39:17,180 --> 02:39:18,320
Yeah, one of the OG.

2623
02:39:18,980 --> 02:39:22,080
She helped everyone learn about Goon.

2624
02:39:22,660 --> 02:39:32,820
She was the Kickstarter of the Goon Bellion.

2625
02:39:32,820 --> 02:39:36,040
She was the trigger finger.

2626
02:39:39,900 --> 02:39:40,500
Yay!

2627
02:39:44,850 --> 02:39:45,590
Share your score.

2628
02:39:46,190 --> 02:39:48,090
Share your score with Amber.

2629
02:39:48,210 --> 02:39:49,310
Yeah, I'll do it.

2630
02:39:49,570 --> 02:39:51,050
I'll let you share my score.

2631
02:39:51,450 --> 02:39:51,770
Let me go.

2632
02:39:52,110 --> 02:39:53,050
Yeah, share your score.

2633
02:39:53,270 --> 02:39:58,670
Let me hide my screen real quick and share my score.

2634
02:40:00,050 --> 02:40:01,650
Score, copy, the clipboard.

2635
02:40:01,770 --> 02:40:02,270
Wait, what?

2636
02:40:02,450 --> 02:40:04,370
Oh, I guess you go and paste it like on your screen.

2637
02:40:04,470 --> 02:40:05,590
Like this, look.

2638
02:40:08,030 --> 02:40:09,750
I'll tweet that out.

2639
02:40:12,270 --> 02:40:13,990
Now it looks like Wordle.

2640
02:40:14,930 --> 02:40:15,090
Yeah.

2641
02:40:15,890 --> 02:40:16,530
Here we go.

2642
02:40:16,870 --> 02:40:17,950
8 out of 10.

2643
02:40:18,730 --> 02:40:19,650
Not bad.

2644
02:40:19,970 --> 02:40:20,190
Not bad.

2645
02:40:20,250 --> 02:40:21,170
No, not bad.

2646
02:40:21,390 --> 02:40:22,450
We did pretty well.

2647
02:40:22,670 --> 02:40:23,930
Yeah, I think so.

2648
02:40:24,930 --> 02:40:25,330
Yeah.

2649
02:40:26,670 --> 02:40:27,490
Go, go!

2650
02:40:28,570 --> 02:40:29,890
Oh my god, wait.

2651
02:40:30,230 --> 02:40:33,490
No, I used to watch stuff for both of these kids.

2652
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:47,980
It's so hard to pick because both of these yet isn't it?

2653
02:40:52,180 --> 02:40:53,420
I want to believe in Minna.

2654
02:40:53,880 --> 02:40:55,840
I want to believe in Minna too.

2655
02:40:57,120 --> 02:40:58,160
Even though Goku's my husband.

2656
02:40:58,740 --> 02:40:58,900
Oh!

2657
02:41:00,040 --> 02:41:00,600
Barely!

2658
02:41:01,120 --> 02:41:01,680
Barely!

2659
02:41:02,940 --> 02:41:06,120
I can't believe you didn't believe in your husband like this.

2660
02:41:07,300 --> 02:41:08,340
Nobody does.

2661
02:41:08,640 --> 02:41:09,940
Nobody believes it.

2662
02:41:10,380 --> 02:41:11,680
Life doesn't believe it.

2663
02:41:13,140 --> 02:41:14,140
Yeah, that's you.

2664
02:41:19,570 --> 02:41:20,450
Can't be.

2665
02:41:20,670 --> 02:41:22,650
Goku doesn't lose.

2666
02:41:23,070 --> 02:41:23,590
Finally.

2667
02:41:25,370 --> 02:41:27,810
How does Goku have so many in Navajin?

2668
02:41:28,850 --> 02:41:30,670
Because Goku's always winning.

2669
02:41:30,810 --> 02:41:31,510
What do you mean?

2670
02:41:35,630 --> 02:41:38,410
Because the ladies will pick Goku.

2671
02:41:40,230 --> 02:41:42,010
To be fair, it's like way closer.

2672
02:41:42,030 --> 02:41:43,210
than I thought it was going to be.

2673
02:41:43,310 --> 02:41:43,970
Yeah, me too.

2674
02:41:44,110 --> 02:41:45,390
I was like, whoa.

2675
02:41:49,350 --> 02:41:50,970
Goku always solos.

2676
02:41:51,490 --> 02:41:52,010
That was fun.

2677
02:41:52,070 --> 02:41:53,050
I had a great time.

2678
02:41:53,070 --> 02:41:53,630
That was fun.

2679
02:41:53,930 --> 02:41:54,050
Yeah.

2680
02:41:54,750 --> 02:41:57,630
Let me turn off the classical music now.

2681
02:41:58,230 --> 02:41:58,330
Aw.

2682
02:41:59,810 --> 02:42:01,810
I was feeling so sophisticated.

2683
02:42:02,050 --> 02:42:10,130
You know, while we were looking through, while we were looking through Rule 34, oh my, that was a fun time, though.

2684
02:42:10,330 --> 02:42:11,190
That was fun, yeah.

2685
02:42:11,190 --> 02:42:47,410
I admit went in with I guess like blindly not knowing what we're gonna be doing no at all yeah um but we learned a lot about each other today um maybe a little bit too much but that's okay it was indeed a very very wild ride learned a lot of people's interests as well.

2686
02:42:47,830 --> 02:42:48,390
Captain Price.

2687
02:42:52,430 --> 02:42:54,330
Now you have to play Call of Duty.

2688
02:42:55,110 --> 02:42:56,730
I already do play Call of Duty.

2689
02:42:57,290 --> 02:42:58,210
What do you mean?

2690
02:42:59,010 --> 02:43:03,870
Yeah, I've streamed some of Call of Duty games, but I don't know who the fuck Captain Price is.

2691
02:43:04,170 --> 02:43:04,590
Who the fuck?

2692
02:43:04,590 --> 02:43:05,250
I just want to know.

2693
02:43:05,350 --> 02:43:09,710
Who are the two fans of Captain Price that's uploaded 337?

2694
02:43:10,010 --> 02:43:10,490
Captain Price.

2695
02:43:11,250 --> 02:44:07,290
artworks of him now because it was 34 last time so someone found three more images to put in how do you not know who he is he's been in he appears in everything since before how many call of duty games are there i have no idea he's in one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen games in oh there's 13 games yeah he was right every year there's no way he's he was in the very first game there's no way he's that popular he was in call of duty four that's what he started oh okay i can't even remember who plays what bro he's just look at him he's so generic what does he

2696
02:44:11,190 --> 02:44:14,250
He doesn't look ready to fight.

2697
02:44:14,930 --> 02:44:16,370
Where's your helmet, soldier?

2698
02:44:16,730 --> 02:44:18,390
Soldier, why are you fishing?

2699
02:44:18,750 --> 02:44:20,650
We have a war to go to.

2700
02:44:21,230 --> 02:44:29,630
Okay, he also goes by Bravo 6, Bravo 1, prisoner number 627, Black Viking, dollar sign,

02:44:33,710 --> 02:44:38,930
B02, 9051210, Old Man and Classic Price.

2702
02:44:39,590 --> 02:44:41,090
Classic Price.

2703
02:44:41,190 --> 02:44:43,750
His name is John Price.

2704
02:44:43,830 --> 02:44:44,250
No.

2705
02:44:45,250 --> 02:44:47,490
He gave me this first name's not Captain.

2706
02:44:49,930 --> 02:44:51,790
He's literally the meme.

2707
02:44:52,410 --> 02:44:52,430
John.

2708
02:44:52,510 --> 02:44:53,890
John Meem.

2709
02:44:54,210 --> 02:44:55,110
John of Duty.

2710
02:44:55,670 --> 02:44:56,090
It's him.

2711
02:44:56,490 --> 02:44:57,010
John of Duty.

2712
02:44:57,690 --> 02:44:58,410
Oh my God.

2713
02:44:58,650 --> 02:44:59,570
We got him.

2714
02:44:59,770 --> 02:45:00,790
John of Duty.

2715
02:45:06,980 --> 02:45:08,860
Oh my God.

2716
02:45:09,240 --> 02:45:10,880
I can't believe it.

2717
02:45:11,260 --> 02:45:12,740
Fucking Captain Price.

2718
02:45:13,260 --> 02:45:14,560
I can't believe he was in the God.

2719
02:45:14,580 --> 02:45:16,580
goddamn daily challenge.

2720
02:45:17,980 --> 02:45:19,680
They added him for you.

2721
02:45:19,920 --> 02:45:21,400
Yeah, like we gotta put him in.

2722
02:45:21,660 --> 02:45:23,200
Swap someone out right now.

2723
02:45:23,360 --> 02:45:25,260
We gotta put Captain Price in.

2724
02:45:25,260 --> 02:45:26,440
The devs are watching.

2725
02:45:26,780 --> 02:45:27,480
There's no way.

2726
02:45:27,700 --> 02:45:31,560
There's no way that you and I were in it and then also it.

2727
02:45:31,940 --> 02:45:32,860
There's no way.

2728
02:45:33,760 --> 02:45:34,540
It's an inside.

2729
02:45:34,700 --> 02:45:36,320
This was an inside job.

2730
02:45:36,680 --> 02:45:37,940
This is an inside job.

2731
02:45:38,560 --> 02:45:38,640
Yeah.

2732
02:45:41,180 --> 02:45:42,300
They knew.

2733
02:45:42,640 --> 02:45:44,560
His stream sniping us.

2734
02:45:44,580 --> 02:45:51,900
That's why they kept giving us freebies And then also, yeah, Storm the Albatross The Storm the Albatross

2735
02:45:55,180 --> 02:46:25,820

2737

I guess.

2742
02:47:21,360 --> 02:47:29,660
Oh, I guess because, like, why newer things have more is because more and more people are accepting the gooner way.

2743
02:47:30,360 --> 02:47:31,900
And they're not scared anymore.

2744
02:47:32,240 --> 02:47:33,360
They're not scared.

2745
02:47:33,660 --> 02:47:35,540
They're not scared anymore.

2746
02:47:37,300 --> 02:47:38,800

2765
02:48:46,700 --> 02:48:47,680
PTSD

2766
02:48:52,300 --> 02:48:55,200
Yeah, I'm so happy we didn't get Garfield.

2767
02:48:55,700 --> 02:49:01,620
Thank God you you would have had to change Why didn't you wear Garfield today?

2768
02:49:03,040 --> 02:49:05,960
Because why should I why would I be wearing Garfield?

2769
02:49:10,230 --> 02:49:12,710
Don't keep promise she would wear Garfield today.

2770
02:49:12,990 --> 02:49:13,270
That is not true.

2771
02:49:13,270 --> 02:49:13,890
That is not true.

2772
02:49:13,950 --> 02:49:17,130
She is that is not true What do you okay?

2773
02:49:17,390 --> 02:49:18,490
No, man, what do you have?

2774
02:49:18,750 --> 02:49:19,870
What's with you and Garfield?

2775
02:49:19,890 --> 02:49:20,230
Huh?

2776
02:49:20,590 --> 02:49:21,730
What is it?

2777
02:49:21,910 --> 02:49:24,090
We were literally at a hentai club together.

2778
02:49:24,370 --> 02:49:24,970
Don't lie.

2779
02:49:30,810 --> 02:49:34,190
You see, we should, we should make a new club.

2780
02:49:36,370 --> 02:49:43,230
You can be the vice president of the Garfield Club.

2781
02:49:45,370 --> 02:49:49,030
Because, do you say we're, we're cringe and free now?

2782
02:49:49,510 --> 02:49:49,850
Yeah!

2783
02:49:49,890 --> 02:49:57,830
shouldn't be scared anymore the two only the two members of the cartfield head tie club

2784
02:50:01,870 --> 02:50:23,950
i hope we don't get a c synthesis oh my god if we have enough members we might uh what we could do outings no no no no we're not gonna we're not gonna do outings i'm saying if we have enough members, Jim Davis might notice us.

2785
02:50:25,850 --> 02:50:29,190
It'll be like the most popular Garfield group online.

2786
02:50:29,670 --> 02:50:35,550
And then maybe PopBase will make a tweet about us.

2787
02:50:35,930 --> 02:50:39,850
Maybe they'll be like, do not join.

2788
02:50:40,630 --> 02:50:44,630
They give you, they send you a link to Jenny, my grandpa.

2789
02:50:45,210 --> 02:50:47,270
And it gives you a virus.

2790
02:50:52,740 --> 02:50:58,140
I think if I ever did a cease and desist from Jim Davis, I think that's the greatest honor.

2791
02:50:58,360 --> 02:51:01,100
I'll have a signature from Jim.

2792
02:51:01,120 --> 02:51:03,540
I'll have a free autograph from Jim Davis.

2793
02:51:04,740 --> 02:51:06,940
You should, like, make it into merch.

2794
02:51:07,360 --> 02:51:08,560
Yeah, I frame it.

2795
02:51:10,380 --> 02:51:12,740
It's a curfew on EdTech Club.

2796
02:51:13,440 --> 02:51:15,440
Put it on a t-shirt or something.

2797
02:51:16,020 --> 02:51:19,520
I got a cease and desist from Jim Davis.

2798
02:51:21,540 --> 02:51:26,000
And then like the back would be the front or the back would be the cease and desist.

2799
02:51:26,540 --> 02:51:32,480
And then the other side would be like, I got a cease and desist from Jim Davis for starting a Garfield Hentai Club.

2800
02:51:34,140 --> 02:51:34,580
Yeah.

2801
02:51:35,540 --> 02:51:36,740
Everyone would get it.

2802
02:51:37,160 --> 02:51:37,640
I know.

2803
02:51:37,800 --> 02:51:40,140
I think it would be a top seller too.

2804
02:51:40,500 --> 02:51:40,940
I think.

2805
02:51:43,840 --> 02:51:45,340
We should do it.

2806
02:51:45,700 --> 02:51:47,320
We should do it.

2807
02:51:47,500 --> 02:51:48,220
We should do it.

2808
02:51:48,300 --> 02:51:49,180
We should do it.

2809
02:51:49,740 --> 02:51:52,880
Imagine, oh my God, you know, any publicity is

2810
02:51:56,800 --> 02:52:15,560
then he'll know it as vtubers then he'll know what vtubers are you could send an apology video as your car fuel you're like I'm sorry I'm your biggest fan I love you and then he'll send another one because you're using the car fuel resemblance

2811
02:52:22,250 --> 02:52:25,890
then I'll have two autographs I'll have two

2812
02:52:31,320 --> 02:52:34,440
One for my office and one for my bedroom.

2813
02:52:34,920 --> 02:52:36,400
I'll have it framed.

2814
02:52:36,920 --> 02:52:38,280
Yeah, it'll be great.

2815
02:52:42,260 --> 02:52:42,940
Oh.

2816
02:52:44,260 --> 02:52:46,400
Anyway, thank you guys for coming.

Yes.

2819
02:52:53,380 --> 02:52:55,100

2820
02:52:55,360 --> 02:52:56,180
Did we enjoy your time?

02:53:19,100 --> 02:53:21,260
No, I was going to say Albatross.

2829
02:53:21,540 --> 02:53:23,220
I'm sorry, if either one works.

2830
02:53:23,960 --> 02:53:24,240
