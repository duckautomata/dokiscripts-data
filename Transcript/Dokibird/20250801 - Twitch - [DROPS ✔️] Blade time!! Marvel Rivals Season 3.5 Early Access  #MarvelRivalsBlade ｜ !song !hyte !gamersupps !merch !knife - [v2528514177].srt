1
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,400
Wow!

2
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:49,780
Hello, everybody!

3
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,260
Whoa!

4
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,320
Give me a sec.

5
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,040
We're not watching.

6
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,740
Whoa, look!

7
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:53,340
It's Blade!

8
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,220
Oh, my God!

9
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:54,780
I forgot it!

10
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,560
All of our plays!

11
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:56,780
Blade!

12
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,500
Hello, everyone!

13
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:01,660
Hello!

14
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:09,520
Yes, if you guys didn't know, a huge shout-out to Marvel Rivals Devs for sponsoring today's stream.

15
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:17,920
Yes, I have early access to season 3.5 of Marvel Rivals, which means they finally released Blade!

16
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,220
Yes, he's finally freed!

17
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,140
They've teased Blade for, like, three seasons, and now he's finally here.

18
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,120
I like how every time... Sorry, I'm lying.

19
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,920
Every time, they were like, oh, new character!

20
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,000
They're like, is it Blade?

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,440
And then it's not Blade, and you see him, like, in random areas of the map.

22
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,260
In different parts of the map, and you're just like, someone free him, please!

23
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:51,880
Like, first he was caged, then he was sleeping, and then he disappeared!

24
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,460
Where is he?

25
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,120
But finally, he's... Yeah, finally, he's no longer Eepie!

26
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:58,740
Yeah!

27
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,460
But yes, he's very excited.

28
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:12,700
Like I said, a huge shout-out to the Marvel Rivals Dev Team for reaching out to me, for it to participate in the early access season 3.5.

29
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,720
There's a lot of new updates coming in, not just Blade.

30
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,200
Apparently, there's a lot of changes, a lot of reworks, and stuff like that.

31
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,020
Some really good skins coming out for those who are into that, too.

32
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,220
Yeah, it only took three seasons to tie the rope.

33
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,380
What else is there?

34
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:37,980
Oh yeah, for those who don't know, the newest season will release on August 8th, and Marvel Rivals is free to play!

35
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:45,060
So, you can check out Marvel Rivals right now, and download it with the link pinned in the chat, or like on the panel, too.

36
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,500
So anyway, let's watch Blade and see what he does.

37
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,160
I did like... I'll do... I'll spoil it a little bit.

38
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:58,340
I did check out a little bit of Blade before, just to like test things out.

39
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,780
His kit is weird.

40
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,180
His... I'm not... I don't want to say weird.

41
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,200
His kit is unique, in a way where you can melee or not melee.

42
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:14,000
So, like, you can use a gun or not melee, which is pretty interesting, because I don't think we have a character that can swap between the two.

43
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,640
Uh, but yeah, let's watch the trailer real quick.

44
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,180
There he is!

45
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,120
There's Blade!

46
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,960
Yeah, so you can see him melee here.

47
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,280
And then he can... See, he has a gun.

48
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,860
So it's like, they're too far.

49
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,980
I'll just shoot him, I guess.

50
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,360
Yeah, he's a hybrid.

51
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:32,800
Yeah.

52
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,120
And he... Since he is a vampire, he has lifesteal.

53
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,580
So you can see down there below.

54
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,540
Yeah.

55
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,700
You already see that he has lifesteal.

56
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,560
His all is crazy, though.

57
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,180
Like, I'm trying to figure out, like, how do you counter that?

58
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:50,740
Like... I'm wondering, like, does it stop after you, when you die?

59
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:51,720
Like...

60
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,700
Yeah.

61
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:00,120
Yeah, so he has lifesteal, and he actually has an ability where he can slow people down, too.

62
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,220
So it's... It's, uh...

63
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,740
Yeah, yeah, it's very interesting.

64
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,280
You can swap between the two, which I found out.

65
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:11,200
But anyway, um, other than that, let's watch the... The dev thing.

66
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:18,960
We'll go through this one really quick, because, um, there's only one thing that I'm interested in, and it is...

67
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,460
Um... Where is it?

68
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,300
Sorry, Blade.

69
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,400
We already saw about you.

70
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,800
It's... This.

71
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,280
So...

72
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,440
There's new team-ups and everything.

73
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:30,820
So...

74
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,680
The fact... By the way, they finally buffed Adam.

75
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,260
Like, they actually gave him legs.

76
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,680
Like...

77
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:42,920
They decided not to... Not to break his knees today... For, like, this... To the new season.

78
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,880
It's actually crazy.

79
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,580
I was like, oh my god!

80
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:50,360
They actually... They gave him... They gave him legs again.

81
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,200
And... Yeah, they're like, you know what?

82
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,760
We'll let you walk this season.

83
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:54,880
Um...

84
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,680
He can actually walk this season.

85
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,500
So, this is very interesting.

86
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,060
This team-up...

87
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,500
To be fair, um...

88
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,380
I'm not complaining, because I'm a Luna main.

89
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,340
But it's so funny that, like, they give Luna everything.

90
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:10,900
I...

91
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,840
The neighbor's like...

92
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,720
This is the greed they talk about in the Bible.

93
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,100
I feel like every season, Luna always gets, like, an extra buff.

94
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,640
And I'm like...

95
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,000
I don't...

96
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,780
I'm not complaining.

97
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,540
I was like, yes!

98
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,280
I'm so hungry!

99
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,560
Oh my...

100
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,480
It's like, please!

101
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,440
I'm so hungry!

102
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,720
And then you're like...

103
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,800
Wait, Luna, didn't you get buff?

104
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,240
It's like, I'm so...

105
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,220
Hungry!

106
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,720
I take this.

107
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,880
Yeah, so for those who don't know...

108
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,640
Luna's new team-up with Adam...

109
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,200
Is, uh...

110
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,140
Is that when she...

111
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:54,440
She has a link where if she links to someone else, she gets lifesteal.

112
00:06:54,920 --> 00:07:00,700
So, like, basically, she's, again, a lot stronger to survive dive now.

113
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,560
And then I thought this was, like, really funny.

114
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,000
Because Loki already got nerfed.

115
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,800
They, like, broke Loki's shins, like, last season or, like, this season.

116
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,440
And then they're like, they're like, you know what?

117
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,000
Don't worry, we can rebuild you.

118
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,160
So this is his new team-up where...

119
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,560
His new buff where...

120
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,620
This is bigger.

121
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,140
The lamp is bigger.

122
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,540
And it does...

123
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,820
It boosts every stat.

124
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,880
If you're...

125
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,060
If you're in the lamp, you get a boost of all your stats.

126
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,700
So you get damage boosts and everything.

127
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,440
If you're in the lamp.

128
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,640
So, um, so they're like...

129
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,940
So they, like, they, like, you know what?

130
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:38,600
We'll fix you.

131
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,380
And this one is crazy.

132
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,100
Groot's thing...

133
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,400
Groot's walls can heal you now.

134
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,160
That's crazy.

135
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,660
I could literally build a house around us and we'll be safe.

136
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,560
I'll be like, don't worry, child.

137
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,420
I'll keep you safe.

138
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,820
They're like, don't worry, child.

139
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,420
I'll keep you safe in my home.

140
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,700
Um, but Arbus has a new team-up.

141
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,280
I don't really understand this one.

142
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,580
Um, Star-Lord has, like, a TP thing now.

143
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,260
So he can teleport.

144
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,960
And it doesn't seem like there's a range from what I've seen.

145
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,060
Um, yeah, I can't believe my...

146
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,460
And then Blade has the cloaking thing.

147
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,080
So I feel like a lot of the team-ups are very interesting.

148
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,380
Uh, so there's a new resource rumble.

149
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,780
So these were, like, the things I wanted to focus on.

150
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,840
Because I thought they were pretty...

151
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,740
They did a new...

152
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,820
Oh, yeah, so there's also the land thing.

153
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,960
So I think these were all the things I wanted to look at.

154
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,060
Um, other than that, another thing, they changed competitive.

155
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,840
Where if someone leaves on your team, um, you don't get punished as hard.

156
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,700
So I thought that was an interesting change that they did for competitive.

157
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,360
Anyway, it's time for the real...

158
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,880
Um, the real stream.

159
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,040
Looking at the skins.

160
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,420
Third...

161
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,460
I already bought it just so we can go through everything.

162
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,180
A third person, baby!

163
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,980
So there's Queen's Codex.

164
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,300
Is that Psylocke?

165
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:09,880
Oh my god.

166
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:10,700
I've...

167
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,480
Wait, no, that's...

168
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,180
No, that's Widow.

169
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,300
This is...

170
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:14,900
Um...

171
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,680
Oh my gosh.

172
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:16,700
Whoa.

173
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,500
Well, I didn't...

174
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:18,740
Whoa.

175
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:19,560
Whoa.

176
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,800
I don't know why I went with Psylocke first.

177
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,900
Just because I feel like...

178
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,940
Psylocke gets everything she ever wants.

179
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,560
Psylocke players get...

180
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,940
Oh, yeah, and they have the...

181
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,860
They have the Thing skin, too.

182
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,060
Uh, Thing Venom.

183
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,940
Oh my god.

184
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,020
Monkey.

185
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,680
Oh, wait, that goes hard.

186
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:46,620
So...

187
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,740
Alright, and then there's the Hella skin.

188
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,100
That's from the...

189
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:50,920
Uh...

190
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,400
That's from the...

191
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,600
The...

192
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,200
Launcher intro.

193
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,880
I thought this was already released.

194
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,920
I didn't realize it was...

195
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,180
It's releasing, like, in August 8th.

196
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,340
Um...

197
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:00,640
But...

198
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,440
I like this skin.

199
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,860
I think this is the best Hella skin they have.

200
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:04,960
Um...

201
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,520
I personally don't like the other Hella skins.

202
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,740
So I think this one's the best one so far.

203
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,080
Oh, there's no game audio.

204
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,700
My bad.

205
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,140
Sorry, guys.

206
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,140
There was nothing to really hear anyway.

207
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,560
Ha ha ha ha!

208
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,040
Yeah, I think this one's...

209
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,920
I think this is the best Hella skin they've had.

210
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,260
Oh, and then there's the Emote.

211
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,700
I believe those are all the newest skins.

212
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,800
I think.

213
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,440
Yeah, these are all the newest skins.

214
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,920
For those who didn't want to...

215
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,960
Who didn't hear this.

216
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,780
All right, but...

217
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,900
Yeah, those are all of them.

218
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:41,880
And then...

219
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,880
Then there's Blade.

220
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,060
Ooh!

221
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,580
I want to hear Thing!

222
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,660
Okay, I'll let you hear Thing.

223
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,480
Give me a sec.

224
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,660
There you go.

225
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,940
Look at him go.

226
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,360
Rah!

227
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:58,340
Rah!

228
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,220
Ha ha ha ha!

229
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,420
Ha ha ha!

230
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:01,820
All right.

231
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,260
Well, now we can look at Blade again.

232
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,520
All right.

233
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:06,800
So...

234
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,320
There's...

235
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:08,520
Ooh!

236
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,820
Polarity Edge.

237
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,840
Meaning Spire Life and Void.

238
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,280
It makes something that shouldn't exist.

239
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,120
Oh, that's sick.

240
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:21,980
All right.

241
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,620
I would say...

242
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,780
This is a sick...

243
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,260
Oh my god.

244
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,520
Who the fuck is she?

245
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,700
Oh my god.

246
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,380
Blade, I didn't know you...

247
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:29,700
What?

248
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,540
Damn, Blade.

249
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:32,400
Okay.

250
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,720
I would say this skin is sick.

251
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,820
But his default is so fucking iconic, though.

252
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:38,700
Like...

253
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,920
I don't know.

254
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,860
I feel like...

255
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,400
We waited...

256
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,320
I don't know.

257
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,100
We waited so long for him to be in the game.

258
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,440
That, like...

259
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:48,680
It's...

260
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,900
It's a crime to not have his default on.

261
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,100
Ha ha ha ha!

262
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,100
Ha ha ha!

263
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,540
The sentence...

264
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,360
The skin is sick!

265
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,180
But, like...

266
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,980
We waited so long for Blade.

267
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,000
Ha ha ha!

268
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,280
And it's already...

269
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,200
It's so iconic.

270
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:01,500
Yeah.

271
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,120
It's, like...

272
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,480
So iconic, too.

273
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,400
Um...

274
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,900
But the skins are really cool.

275
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:08,600
Oh my god.

276
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,800
The hunt is on.

277
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:10,400
All right.

278
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,120
Here's the MVP.

279
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,200
I want to look at it on.

280
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,280
Default Blade, though.

281
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:15,900
All right.

282
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,880
What's this?

283
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,460
Oh, this is a...

284
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,540
A newer one.

285
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,720
The World Cutter.

286
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,700
Yeah, we waited...

287
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,560
Not even months.

288
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,260
It's, like...

289
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,340
Like, they've been teasing Blade since Season Zero.

290
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,680
I'm pretty sure.

291
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,900
He's been teased for...

292
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,720
Since Season Zero.

293
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:38,600
And then, like...

294
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,260
We got baited for, like...

295
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,380
Every Season on...

296
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,500
We're like...

297
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,480
Is it Blade Time?

298
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,680
Is it...

299
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,220
And they're like...

300
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:46,400
Nope.

301
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,080
Here...

302
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,220
Here's the Fantastic Four.

303
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,520
And then we're like...

304
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:50,700
Wait.

305
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,880
Is it Blade Time now?

306
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,680
And then...

307
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,060
Nope.

308
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:53,880
Here's...

309
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,600
Here's Phoenix.

310
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,320
Yeah.

311
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,200
He looks so cool.

312
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:58,540
Um...

313
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:58,720
But yeah.

314
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,660
I'll show you guys...

315
00:12:59,660 --> 00:12:59,860
Oh yeah.

316
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,440
What does his Lord icon look like?

317
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:02,660
Oh...

318
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:02,800
Wait.

319
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,160
Mmm...

320
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,620
I don't...

321
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,160
I don't know.

322
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:07,820
I don't feel...

323
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,680
I feel like...

324
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,040
It'd be cooler...

325
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,260
If his Lord icon...

326
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,020
Is...

327
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:13,220
Yeah.

328
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,100
Bro is sleeping for the longest time...

329
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:15,980
For him to go outside.

330
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,800
I think it'd be cooler...

331
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,560
If the Blade was...

332
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,260
Sticking out.

333
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,380
Instead of, like...

334
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,280
Covering his face.

335
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:24,800
Um...

336
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,080
Um...

337
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,460
He comes out on August 8th.

338
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,200
By the way, guys.

339
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,380
For those who are wondering...

340
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,900
You'll be able to play...

341
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,020
Blade on...

342
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,340
August 8th.

343
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,000
Everybody.

344
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:33,940
Alright.

345
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:34,680
Let's...

346
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,720
Let us...

347
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,580
Go to the practice range now.

348
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:39,560
Alright.

349
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,920
Now let's check out Blade.

350
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,480
For real.

351
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,020
For real.

352
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:43,440
For real.

353
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,020
Yeah.

354
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,000
Or behind his head.

355
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:45,220
Yeah.

356
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:45,620
I agree.

357
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,600
I feel like it definitely...

358
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,880
They definitely could have...

359
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,200
Made it a little...

360
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:50,820
More...

361
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,500
I guess like...

362
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:51,980
Legible?

363
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,680
For Blade?

364
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:53,560
But like...

365
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,380
It's still pretty cool.

366
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,900
I think...

367
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,160
I like the non...

368
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,460
I like the non...

369
00:13:59,460 --> 00:13:59,940
Uh...

370
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,840
The non-Lord icon.

371
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,240
More...

372
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:01,380
Okay.

373
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,000
So...

374
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,900
So like I said...

375
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,360
You can...

376
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,000
You can...

377
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,020
That's the headshot damage.

378
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,380
You can do...

379
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,060
Uh...

380
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:09,360
Gun?

381
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:10,700
Or...

382
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,700
You can swap to melee.

383
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:12,660
So...

384
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,300
What was interesting about it was...

385
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,200
There's a dash here.

386
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,200
I think that's the shift.

387
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:18,760
Yeah.

388
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,420
And then the blue thing is...

389
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,340
Um...

390
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,060
The blue was...

391
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,600
I think it was like...

392
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,800
Less healing.

393
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,400
I believe.

394
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,260
Yeah.

395
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,360
Healing reduction.

396
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:30,720
Yeah.

397
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,080
It's healing reduction effect.

398
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,120
So there's a healing reduction effect for it.

399
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,400
When you do that.

400
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,200
So it's the shift.

401
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,700
And then...

402
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,880
There's the...

403
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,340
Melee.

404
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,600
Which is just a...

405
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:40,980
Spin!

406
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,580
And then like I said...

407
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,700
He has like the little...

408
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,120
Yeah.

409
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,060
He has...

410
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,580
Um...

411
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,020
He has...

412
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:49,820
He has hybrid.

413
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:50,420
Basically.

414
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,080
And then you can...

415
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,820
You have to press E for this.

416
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,780
To get the...

417
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,600
The...

418
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,540
Like the...

419
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,000
Light leech.

420
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,040
Or...

421
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,100
Vampiric thing.

422
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,620
So you can get his...

423
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,040
Uh...

424
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,260
You can get all his skills back.

425
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,020
And then there's a deflect.

426
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:06,540
But...

427
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,160
Is it working?

428
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,320
Am I...

429
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,540
Am I doing it?

430
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,260
Am I...

431
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:14,520
Am I...

432
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,140
Wait...

433
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:15,380
Wait...

434
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,480
Am I deflecting?

435
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,900
Wait a minute.

436
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,440
Let me double check the deflect.

437
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,720
Where's the right click?

438
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:22,800
Harry...

439
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,520
To become...

440
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,360
Reducing...

441
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:24,460
Oh!

442
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,720
It reduces damage.

443
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,240
And decreases the cooldown.

444
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:27,680
Okay.

445
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,660
It decreases cooldown.

446
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,260
And does like damage reduction.

447
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,060
Okay.

448
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,740
That makes sense.

449
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,460
Okay.

450
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,440
I was gonna be like...

451
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,020
Where...

452
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,080
Why isn't it going back to him?

453
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,600
Bro is not deflecting.

454
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,040
I was like...

455
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,440
Bro!

456
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,300
Why aren't you deflecting, bro?

457
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,660
What's the point of having a sword if you don't deflect?

458
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,260
But it's just damage reduction.

459
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,160
Okay.

460
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,860
This ult is crazy though.

461
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,880
I don't know how you can...

462
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,680
I'm gonna...

463
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,440
We're gonna be doing like a little...

464
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,420
A show match with like the other content creators.

465
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,440
Um...

466
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:57,840
But like...

467
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,800
I don't know how you can counter this.

468
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,240
Like...

469
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,060
Like...

470
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:03,460
I don't...

471
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,680
I don't know how you can counter this.

472
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,680
He's trying.

473
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,020
Yeah.

474
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,540
I didn't...

475
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,140
I didn't pay him $0 to block.

476
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:14,880
Like...

477
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,400
I'm just...

478
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,280
I'm like...

479
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,120
Really curious.

480
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,520
That does not look like it's...

481
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,440
That does not look like you can counter it.

482
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,380
Like...

483
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,020
Oh, I guess Luna ult.

484
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:25,500
Yeah.

485
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,480
It has to be a support ult.

486
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:28,380
Yeah.

487
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,460
But it does damage...

488
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:29,800
Uh...

489
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,640
Heal reduction too.

490
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,320
Did you see that?

491
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,320
There's heal reduction on it.

492
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,800
So I'm like...

493
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,340
Just don't get hit.

494
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:37,820
Guys.

495
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,620
Just don't stand in a straight line.

496
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,640
We'll be fine.

497
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,280
Yeah.

498
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:41,840
That does...

499
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:44,780
Yeah.

500
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,240
That's all I...

501
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:46,540
Like...

502
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:46,940
Because there's...

503
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,640
There's healing reduction.

504
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,300
I'll show it again.

505
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:49,660
Look.

506
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:50,580
You can see.

507
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,300
The blue is a healing reduction.

508
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,060
So...

509
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,720
Oh, make a...

510
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,840
Build a wall with Groot.

511
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:58,420
True.

512
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:58,800
True.

513
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,260
If we build a wall...

514
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,840
Build a house with Groot, it'll be fine.

515
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,080
Right?

516
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,120
It'll be fine.

517
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,720
Just dodge.

518
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,200
Just...

519
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,160
Just walk away.

520
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,120
Forehead.

521
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,120
Um...

522
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,780
But yeah, that's...

523
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,140
Like...

524
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,280
That's basically his ability.

525
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:15,820
His kit.

526
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,240
Um...

527
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:18,800
And then...

528
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,900
Slash, slashy, slashy.

529
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,500
Slashy, slashy.

530
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,180
And then there's the whirlwind.

531
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,480
Slashy, slash.

532
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:26,940
And then...

533
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,080
And then this is the lifesteal.

534
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,420
There's no cooldowns on the lifesteal thing.

535
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,140
So...

536
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,080
You can take that off whenever you want.

537
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,440
Just carry it.

538
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,200
Just block it.

539
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,380
That's all you need.

540
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,440
Just block it.

541
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:39,780
Yeah.

542
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,020
Wait for Groot to build a house.

543
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,300
And we can all just stay there.

544
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:47,980
Um...

545
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,820
I think that's really it regarding Blade.

546
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:52,940
Yeah.

547
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:53,480
When you're...

548
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,620
You're in the vampire mode.

549
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,260
You can only use your melee.

550
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,260
So that's interesting.

551
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,040
So you can't...

552
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:01,340
You know...

553
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,320
You can't shoot them when you're like...

554
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,560
I want to suck your blood.

555
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,080
But there's the damage on the gun.

556
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:11,720
Alright.

557
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,780
Let's do team-ups now.

558
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:13,760
Alright.

559
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,360
What are the new...

560
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:15,840
Oh my gosh.

561
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,020
Wait.

562
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,440
Did they do it?

563
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,120
Oh no.

564
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,420
They do...

565
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,960
Oh my god.

566
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,380
I want to do this now.

567
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:23,680
This one.

568
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,260
Pick me up.

569
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,080
Weeeeee.

570
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:29,640
Okay.

571
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,340
I never got a chance to see that.

572
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,320
That...

573
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:33,900
Okay.

574
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:34,700
I'm sorry.

575
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:35,880
That's like...

576
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,700
That's like hilarious when he gets to fly.

577
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,920
He's like...

578
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,140
Weeeeee.

579
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,460
Alright.

580
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,300
So...

581
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,820
What I want to know...

582
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,560
Is...

583
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,560
How far is the TP?

584
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,200
Alright.

585
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,280
Cause I didn't...

586
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:51,780
The thing is...

587
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,780
I didn't see a ring...

588
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,580
On it.

589
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,400
Oh.

590
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,200
There's no range.

591
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:57,940
Wait.

592
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,100
I don't think there is...

593
00:18:59,100 --> 00:18:59,340
What?

594
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,100
Wait.

595
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:02,860
Wait.

596
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,220
Guys.

597
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,240
I don't think there is a range.

598
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:07,900
Okay.

599
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,380
Alright.

600
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,000
Let's try.

601
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,740
And I'm back.

602
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,420
Oh.

603
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:15,640
Wait.

604
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:16,820
Wait.

605
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,180
What?

606
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:22,940
Oh.

607
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,220
It's there...

608
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:24,760
Forever.

609
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,420
Oh.

610
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,420
Until someone destroys it.

611
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,260
Oh.

612
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,000
The cooldown is 20...

613
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,020
Like 30...

614
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,140
I think this was 30...

615
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:36,520
Oh.

616
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,240
It's actually...

617
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:38,480
Okay.

618
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,540
You can...

619
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,520
Use that forever.

620
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,020
Yeah.

621
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,180
So there's like...

622
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,320
So if I...

623
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:46,800
Put that here...

624
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,220
And then I just...

625
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:50,540
Wee...

626
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:53,060
This is where the fun begins.

627
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,380
Can you tell I don't play Star-Lord?

628
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:56,840
Wee...

629
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,260
Wee...

630
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,060
Am I...

631
00:19:59,060 --> 00:19:59,480
Oh.

632
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,300
It's so...

633
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:00,480
Yeah.

634
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,340
Cause I was like...

635
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:01,460
Wait.

636
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,060
When I was watching the trailer...

637
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:03,880
I was like...

638
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,020
Wait.

639
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,460
There's no range to this.

640
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:06,460
Oh.

641
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,800
What if you die?

642
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,480
It stays...

643
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,380
I assume when I die...

644
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:10,600
It's...

645
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:11,720
Oh yeah.

646
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,300
There you go.

647
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,140
I'm still here.

648
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:13,500
Okay.

649
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,480
If I die...

650
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,360
It should go away.

651
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,600
Just like Rockets...

652
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:17,620
Uh...

653
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,800
Rockets thing too.

654
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,900
I assume that...

655
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,100
That's how it goes.

656
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,440
All right.

657
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,020
Let's die first and test it out.

658
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,800
Let's see if it's still here after I die.

659
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,220
That's interesting.

660
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,300
Cause I assume that...

661
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:32,780
You know...

662
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,400
Yeah.

663
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,960
It's gone when you die.

664
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,240
So...

665
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,000
So at least there's that.

666
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,700
But it does stay there until...

667
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,320
It stays there until you die.

668
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,860
So there's no like...

669
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,180
Cooldown.

670
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,120
The cooldown is only the TP cooldown.

671
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,140
So like...

672
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:48,840
I guess like...

673
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,360
If you fuck up...

674
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,000
And you know...

675
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,680
You need to like...

676
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,800
An extra escape.

677
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:53,840
But like...

678
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,320
How fast is it though?

679
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,100
That's the thing.

680
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:57,860
Oh!

681
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,480
You can move while you're TPing!

682
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:00,900
Wait!

683
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:01,480
Oh!

684
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:01,780
Okay.

685
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,240
That's...

686
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:02,920
That's scary.

687
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,380
That's...

688
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:04,820
Wait.

689
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,020
You can move while you're...

690
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:06,200
Wait.

691
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,680
Can I shoot while TPing?

692
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,540
Oh!

693
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,120
I can!

694
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,840
I can shoot while I'm TPing too!

695
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,380
So I...

696
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,300
I can literally...

697
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,040
If I feel like this fight is gonna...

698
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,120
Go wrong...

699
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,520
I just press like this.

700
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:18,580
Yeah.

701
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,580
And I can...

702
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,360
That's crazy.

703
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:20,740
Wait.

704
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,320
That's actually so good for Star-Lord players now.

705
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,100
That's like an extra...

706
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:25,840
Because like this...

707
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,320
This is like that...

708
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:27,720
Like...

709
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,060
Um...

710
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,360
It's invincibility frames if I do this correctly.

711
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,360
So...

712
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,000
The fact that I can TP up whenever I want.

713
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:34,820
Yeah.

714
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:35,480
And it's like...

715
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,780
There's no range to it too.

716
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:37,580
Yeah.

717
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,640
They're gonna be so annoyed.

718
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,080
They're gonna...

719
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:40,520
Oh my god.

720
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,320
That's like a huge...

721
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,100
That's actually such a huge buff to Star-Lord.

722
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,160
I...

723
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,140
That's actually crazy.

724
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:46,780
Like...

725
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,300
Yeah.

726
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,100
Another escape.

727
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,380
The fact that like...

728
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,500
I can shoot...

729
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,040
While doing the TP.

730
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:54,640
Like...

731
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,120
Because I could like just be like...

732
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:56,960
Pew pew pew pew pew.

733
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,580
And like...

734
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:57,920
See ya.

735
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,040
Mobility having...

736
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,220
You're having mobility.

737
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,080
But it's non-stop.

738
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,980
It's time to break his legs now.

739
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,320
Okay.

740
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,220
Alright.

741
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,040
What is this?

742
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,800
I don't really understand this, Tima.

743
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:15,640
Uh...

744
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,560
Hawkeye can shoot.

745
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,220
It slows.

746
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,380
When Iron Fist...

747
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,200
He can heal...

748
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:19,440
Oh!

749
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:19,960
Wait!

750
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,300
He's an extra healer now.

751
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,040
He can heal nearby allies.

752
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,360
Oh!

753
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,660
So he can...

754
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,820
For all the people who complain about Iron Fist...

755
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,980
At least he can be a healer.

756
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:29,580
Wait.

757
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,720
Does that mean like...

758
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,180
What's the range though?

759
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,280
How do I activate this?

760
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:34,500
Oh.

761
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:34,960
Is it E?

762
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:36,940
Oh!

763
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,300
Oh!

764
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:38,740
When...

765
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,140
Oh!

766
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:39,600
Okay.

767
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:42,780
Oh!

768
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,660
This heals!

769
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,400
That's the healing ability.

770
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:47,980
I see.

771
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:48,980
So when I press E.

772
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:49,820
I heal.

773
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,880
When I press E.

774
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,780
I heal everybody.

775
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:53,540
Um...

776
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:53,780
Alright.

777
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,340
What else?

778
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,540
What else is there?

779
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:55,800
Okay.

780
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,480
So...

781
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,360
I don't...

782
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:57,640
Okay.

783
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,360
So this one...

784
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,020
I like this...

785
00:22:59,020 --> 00:22:59,740
I like this buff.

786
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,100
So basically if I press E.

787
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,040
And then...

788
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,140
That's looking right.

789
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,740
That's right.

790
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:07,860
Get out of here!

791
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,840
Eight tempo!

792
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,720
So basically...

793
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:14,860
Uh...

794
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,340
He...

795
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:15,540
Oh wait.

796
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,080
So Loki and Mantis...

797
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,300
Has a team up now too.

798
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,500
Uh...

799
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,340
I think this is crazy.

800
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,180
Like...

801
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,280
The fact that...

802
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:25,500
The fact that...

803
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,320
Look how big this circle is.

804
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,940
I can take up the entire...

805
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,260
If I place my clones correctly...

806
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,260
I could technically take over an entire point.

807
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,980
But I need to match this now.

808
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,460
I can...

809
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:44,600
Yeah.

810
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,420
I can take up the entire point.

811
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,720
And it is...

812
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,560
Um...

813
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,520
It is...

814
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,040
Um...

815
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,380
It increases all stats.

816
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,580
So that includes like damage boost and everything.

817
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:54,560
Uh...

818
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,700
Do lambs have more HP?

819
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,140
Ooh.

820
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:56,760
Good question.

821
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,380
We can't test that out.

822
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,320
But everyone has damage boost and speed boost.

823
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:06,860
I think...

824
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,620
I think speed boost...

825
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:07,900
I don't know.

826
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,240
It says all stats.

827
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,000
So I assume like it's speed boost as well.

828
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:12,820
Right?

829
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:13,900
Yeah.

830
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,300
Oh wait.

831
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:14,480
No.

832
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,200
It's just damage.

833
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:15,540
Okay.

834
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,240
It...

835
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,380
It does damage boost too.

836
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,180
So...

837
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:22,940
So yeah.

838
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,500
Everyone in this circle gets like a damage boost.

839
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,180
Which is actually pretty fucking crazy.

840
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:27,800
Yeah.

841
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,760
That's a low key Venn diagram.

842
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,240
I can make a...

843
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:31,620
Guys.

844
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,820
I can make a Venn diagram chat.

845
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:34,980
Oh my...

846
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,780
That's actually insane.

847
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,000
Oh my god.

848
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,520
I don't really remember exactly what they...

849
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,340
I know like he got...

850
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:46,660
Okay guys.

851
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,260
What were exactly his buffs?

852
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,600
Because they did so much...

853
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,700
They like changed so many things on Adam that I couldn't even really...

854
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,780
I like lost...

855
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,240
I was like that is the most amount of words I've seen on Adam.

856
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,200
On a patch note.

857
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:00,580
Yeah.

858
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,780
I was like...

859
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,820
I looked at the patch notes.

860
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:04,660
And I was like wow.

861
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,580
I've never seen Adam get like more than one sentence before.

862
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,720
That's crazy.

863
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,720
What the heck?

864
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,320
Loki enjoys me.

865
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,420
His charge shots reduces...

866
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,860
Snap cooldowns now.

867
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:21,540
Oh wait.

868
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,120
Wait.

869
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,600
This reduces cooldowns?

870
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:23,840
Okay.

871
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,020
Let me...

872
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,880
All right, I'll just waste that real quick.

873
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,020
And then...

874
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,180
Okay.

875
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,420
Oh my god, it does if you hit it.

876
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,520
Yeah, if you hit it, the cooldown reduces.

877
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,100
Yeah.

878
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,560
Revive buff and right... yeah.

879
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,360
It's like... oh wait, it... I get like self heal if I hit it?

880
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,260
All right, let's try.

881
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,660
Oh no, like... oh, cooldown!

882
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,740
Okay, I was gonna say, like, what?

883
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,400
Okay, so if you right click...

884
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,640
Oh my god, I could farm shit with that.

885
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:01,460
Yeah.

886
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:06,980
Yeah, finally, it's been... I've never seen Adam with more than one sentence on a patch note.

887
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,600
So I was like, whoa!

888
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,940
You mean he's not gonna be on a wheelchair this season?

889
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:13,660
Whoa!

890
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,700
So he's playable now.

891
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,700
Oh my god, they finally let him walk this season.

892
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,660
I was so surprised.

893
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,600
I was not expecting that.

894
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:25,280
Yeah.

895
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,160
You mean they're not gonna take him out back?

896
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,080
What else is there?

897
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:37,820
Uh...

898
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,340
Guys, what else do you guys wanna see, chat?

899
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,680
Don't say that!

900
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,400
Look, I'm just saying!

901
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,540
He's finally... Oh, he had the Groot wall!

902
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,060
All right.

903
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,220
Don't worry!

904
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:51,940
I am Groot!

905
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,860
I am Groot!

906
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,180
Don't worry, everybody!

907
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,480
I shall build us a wall!

908
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,100
I am Groot!

909
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,240
Oh wait, this is it.

910
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,120
I am Groot!

911
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:00,960
Be healed!

912
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,840
Are you guys being healed?

913
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:03,140
Oh!

914
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,740
Well, it sucks for that guy.

915
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,280
Oh, there you go!

916
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:05,500
See?

917
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,360
Be healed!

918
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,780
There you go.

919
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,740
I did my job.

920
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,060
I did my job now.

921
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,410
Okay, so it's only on like...

922
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,880
This ability.

923
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,500
I only have like, one.

924
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,700
It's only one wall that does this.

925
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,260
So it's not as...

926
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:27,340
It's not as like, good as I thought it was.

927
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,400
But like...

928
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,360
I could...

929
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,100
The thing is...

930
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,100
I'm thinking like...

931
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,520
I could build...

932
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:32,880
If...

933
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,340
If my team's getting...

934
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,120
Uh...

935
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,720
Getting dove or anything...

936
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,660
I could just like, put a wall.

937
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,440
Yeah, like one special wall.

938
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,180
And...

939
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,260
Okay, I can adjust it.

940
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:43,560
Okay.

941
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,440
What can I do?

942
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,840
I can do like...

943
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,520
Put a special wall here.

944
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,520
And I was like...

945
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,740
Don't worry little guy.

946
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,060
If the black...

947
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:52,840
Oh...

948
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,640
If the black panther comes over...

949
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,420
Just stand near my wall.

950
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,420
No, it's only one...

951
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:03,760
Yeah.

952
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,900
It's only one healing wall.

953
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,380
So...

954
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,760
He still died.

955
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,680
But I didn't expect him to die that fast.

956
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,400
So like...

957
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,340
I could have like a place for him that...

958
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,740
Place for the healers basically.

959
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,620
And there's no like...

960
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,860
Range for that.

961
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:21,720
Dude.

962
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,300
So it's there until I...

963
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:24,880
Destroy it.

964
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,100
It's only...

965
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,340
It's there until I destroy it.

966
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,060
Or like if someone else destroy it.

967
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:29,800
I mean that's cool.

968
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,860
It's like a little extra...

969
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,680
Uh...

970
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,020
Uh...

971
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:33,920
Counter to die.

972
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:34,640
In general.

973
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,260
Yeah, it's like a dab counter.

974
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,380
Which was nice.

975
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,480
Not for heals.

976
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,580
I can place four walls.

977
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,360
But I can only place one heal wall.

978
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,000
See, this is the heal wall.

979
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,780
This is the normal wall.

980
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,860
This is the...

981
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:46,900
This is the...

982
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,520
Strong ass wall.

983
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:48,740
And then...

984
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,920
This is the...

985
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,360
It's like...

986
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,580
It's like I'm actually a...

987
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,160
A...

988
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:53,960
A builder.

989
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,100
Like I'm building a house.

990
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:55,940
With different walls.

991
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,720
You know?

992
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,660
Like there's the pillar.

993
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,340
There's the dry wall.

994
00:28:59,580 --> 00:28:59,640
There's the dry wall.

995
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,840
Don't use dry wall by the way.

996
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,480
There's concrete.

997
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,920
So I get three different...

998
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,820
Three different walls to build.

999
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:08,660
Yeah.

1000
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,100
But I can only have one...

1001
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,340
I can only have one heal...

1002
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,200
Wall that can heal.

1003
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:15,840
Yeah.

1004
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,760
I showed blade earlier.

1005
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:17,960
Um...

1006
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,960
But he's like a hybrid.

1007
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,000
So I can be like...

1008
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,020
Pew!

1009
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:20,480
Pew!

1010
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,440
And then like...

1011
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,580
And then if I don't feel like shooting.

1012
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,980
And I just wanna go ham.

1013
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,080
I just do this.

1014
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,300
And then...

1015
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:28,740
Pew pew!

1016
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,360
Oh, I mean...

1017
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:29,840
Slash slash!

1018
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:30,420
Chop chop!

1019
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,580
And then...

1020
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,140
Chop chop chop!

1021
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:37,860
And then...

1022
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,140
I think this one is a cool move.

1023
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,680
Cause you can dash if I'm like...

1024
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,840
If I'm like...

1025
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,400
I don't know...

1026
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,200
Being a little rat.

1027
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:45,860
I can do that.

1028
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,200
Wait, how...

1029
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,360
What's the range for that actually?

1030
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,680
What is the range?

1031
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,200
How far?

1032
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,300
Okay, that far.

1033
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,300
It's not that...

1034
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,560
Not a very far range.

1035
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,040
But it's still like a good...

1036
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,380
Flanking thing to do.

1037
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,500
Like a gank.

1038
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,520
Yeah, it's a slash and dash.

1039
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:01,880
The...

1040
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,860
Gun damage is pretty...

1041
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,660
I thought it was a shotgun, but...

1042
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:09,400
I'll say the gun does a lot of damage if you hit headshots.

1043
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,920
Body shot, not so much.

1044
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,600
Which I've noticed.

1045
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,240
Oh my god.

1046
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:13,920
The body...

1047
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,380
Okay, wait.

1048
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,380
The body shot is not...

1049
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,900
I mean, it's still pretty...

1050
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,040
A lot.

1051
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,580
But there is fall off though.

1052
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,000
Yeah, it's alright.

1053
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,340
There is fall off.

1054
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,220
For it.

1055
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,000
Which I've noticed.

1056
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,460
Yeah, see it's not...

1057
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,600
It's not that much.

1058
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,400
It's a huge fall off.

1059
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,640
Look at the fall off for this.

1060
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,100
It's pretty far.

1061
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,600
But that's like for body shot.

1062
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,480
It does more from range, does it though?

1063
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,520
It does not seem like it.

1064
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,940
Is it hitscan or projectile?

1065
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,100
It feels hitscan.

1066
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,100
It feels hitscan but...

1067
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,200
Yeah, it does more damage at a...

1068
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:03,720
But...

1069
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:03,960
Really?

1070
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,100
Or...

1071
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:05,940
Yeah, I was gonna say...

1072
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:06,700
Does it though?

1073
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,340
It does not look like it does more...

1074
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,260
Mid-range?

1075
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,480
I would say mid-range.

1076
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:13,840
Yeah?

1077
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,760
Like, this is mid-range.

1078
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,900
And I was like...

1079
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,120
I don't think I'm doing more damage.

1080
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,780
It's a fire...

1081
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,000
It's a projectile?

1082
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,440
It feels like a fast projectile.

1083
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,160
It feels like...

1084
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,600
Fast projectile.

1085
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:31,700
Unbelievable!

1086
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,140
Or...

1087
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,640
It's either hitscan or fast projectile.

1088
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,040
I can't tell if you're sure yet.

1089
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,100
That's three of them.

1090
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,180
Uh...

1091
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,100
It feels very fast for a projectile.

1092
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,100
Yeah.

1093
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,380
Oh, what else guys?

1094
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,180
Is there anything else you guys wanna check out?

1095
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:46,760
Chat?

1096
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,260
Next time, put up a fight.

1097
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,580
Is there anything else you wanna check out?

1098
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,220
Yeah, that's Blade.

1099
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,780
I like how I'm...

1100
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,540
I like how I'm using...

1101
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:56,900
I'm...

1102
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,860
I'm on Blade, but I'm just shooting my gun.

1103
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,800
Ha ha ha ha!

1104
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,180
Blade with exceptions.

1105
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:03,900
Here they come.

1106
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,460
Oh, the Luna...

1107
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:05,600
Okay.

1108
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,820
The Luna Summer skin is out now!

1109
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,760
So, if you guys wanna see the Luna Summer skin...

1110
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,000
Uh, Marvel Rivals is free, by the way.

1111
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,180
So, you can download the game right now.

1112
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:17,860
Uh...

1113
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,840
With the link on my pin in my chat.

1114
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,760
And you can see the Luna skin.

1115
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,080
Ha ha ha ha!

1116
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,040
Ha ha ha!

1117
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,820
Ha ha ha!

1118
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:26,800
Ha ha ha!

1119
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,180
But I wanna see it...

1120
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,260
On stream!

1121
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,440
Donkey!

1122
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:31,320
Ha ha ha!

1123
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,740
Ha ha ha!

1124
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:33,900
Um...

1125
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:34,400
Let's see.

1126
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,980
I mean, there's this team up.

1127
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,320
Um...

1128
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,920
Which is basically the Moon Knight team up.

1129
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:39,920
Where I'm just invisible.

1130
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,760
I can be like...

1131
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,180
Peekaboo!

1132
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,140
To be fair...

1133
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:44,460
Like...

1134
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,540
Yeah, so it's just...

1135
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,060
It's just the same as the Moon Knight.

1136
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,360
The Moon Knight...

1137
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:48,820
Uh...

1138
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,360
Team up.

1139
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,900
I'm just gonna make sure I'm not late.

1140
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:51,540
For...

1141
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,460
The practice range.

1142
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,560
Cause I was last time.

1143
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:54,900
Ha ha ha!

1144
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,660
I just...

1145
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:58,240
I wanna be sure I'm not late for that.

1146
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:58,840
You know?

1147
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:00,520
Ha ha ha!

1148
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:01,080
Ha ha ha!

1149
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,160
Cause I didn't know.

1150
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:02,580
I...

1151
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,540
My Discord had like streamer mode on.

1152
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,820
Ha ha ha!

1153
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,360
Uh...

1154
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:07,520
Okay.

1155
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,100
At 240.

1156
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:08,520
Okay.

1157
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,040
Um...

1158
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:10,480
240.

1159
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,780
I have to do the...

1160
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,400
The show match.

1161
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:12,740
Alright.

1162
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,560
Is there anything else?

1163
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,560
I can dash?

1164
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:14,780
Yeah.

1165
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:15,740
Shift is dash.

1166
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,480
And then...

1167
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,040
The blue is the healing reduction.

1168
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,440
Uh...

1169
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:21,560
What?

1170
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,660
Another team upside there?

1171
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,780
Is that...

1172
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:24,220
Um...

1173
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,820
The newest one is...

1174
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,800
The Iron Fist one.

1175
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,100
Where he could heal players.

1176
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,360
This one was crazy.

1177
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,460
I think Star Lord has a huge buff for the news...

1178
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,120
The half season.

1179
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,200
This one's a crazy buff.

1180
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,340
Also, by the way.

1181
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,060
This is my team.

1182
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:37,400
By the way.

1183
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,120
For those who don't know.

1184
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,340
It's me.

1185
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,240
Fanfan.

1186
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,100
Surefour.

1187
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:42,640
Uh...

1188
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:43,220
Moxie.

1189
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,160
XQC.

1190
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:44,800
And Boger.

1191
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:45,980
That's my team.

1192
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:46,880
It's pretty stacked.

1193
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,480
Not gonna lie.

1194
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,340
I was so surprised.

1195
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:48,980
I was like...

1196
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,980
I was like...

1197
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:51,580
What the...

1198
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:51,980
I can't...

1199
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,220
I'm on a...

1200
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:53,600
To be fair.

1201
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,440
Both teams are also...

1202
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,300
Very stacked.

1203
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,380
Um...

1204
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:57,820
But like...

1205
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,620
I was like surprised.

1206
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,400
Cause usually luck is not on my side.

1207
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,840
When it comes to randomized teams.

1208
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:03,640
Uh...

1209
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:05,360
Usually...

1210
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,220
Usually luck isn't on my side.

1211
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,440
I've been very unlucky with randomized teams.

1212
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,480
So like...

1213
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,440
I'm happy with my team.

1214
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,020
Um...

1215
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:13,240
Yeah.

1216
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,860
Finally a team that's not six supports.

1217
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:16,160
Yeah.

1218
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,200
I was like...

1219
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:17,700
Oh my god.

1220
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,140
We each have our roll guys.

1221
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,280
We each got our roll.

1222
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,260
Alright.

1223
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,080
What else can we see?

1224
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:25,620
Check out.

1225
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,440
Uh...

1226
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:29,680
Oh yeah.

1227
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,200
XQC.

1228
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,260
We playing a new Groot.

1229
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,020
I think he'll like it.

1230
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,060
I mean he is a Groot main.

1231
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,640
So I'm pretty sure he'll enjoy it.

1232
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:35,720
Uh...

1233
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:36,820
So good luck sound team.

1234
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:37,760
Uh...

1235
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,100
Good luck sound team.

1236
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,240
Balancing all of us.

1237
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,320
It's gonna be like...

1238
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,880
I feel like it's gonna be very loud.

1239
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,120
Yeah.

1240
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,860
I mean it's the invisible thing.

1241
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:50,720
So...

1242
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,220
I don't think it's like that new.

1243
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,940
I think it's just the invisible thing.

1244
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:57,280
Pew.

1245
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:57,920
Pew pew.

1246
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,320
I mean slash slash slash.

1247
00:34:59,360 --> 00:34:59,620
Sorry.

1248
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,380
I don't play melee.

1249
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,020
Is it noticeable that I don't play melee?

1250
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:03,540
I don't know.

1251
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,100
I'm so bad with melee characters.

1252
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,180
Cause it's like...

1253
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,920
Why melee when I have a gun?

1254
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,360
Like...

1255
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,000
Why do I have to be so close to them when I have a gun?

1256
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:15,520
Uh...

1257
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,500
Yeah, is this...

1258
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,420
Yeah, his dash is invisible?

1259
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,400
Yeah.

1260
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,240
His dash is invisible.

1261
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,440
When you're in this though.

1262
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,440
Only when you're in this that it's invisible.

1263
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:28,340
Alright.

1264
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:29,860
What else guys?

1265
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,280
Is there anything else you guys wanna see?

1266
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:34,220
I have five minutes left before we have to go into our custom lobby.

1267
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:35,500
Yeah.

1268
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,000
Why shank when you can shoot?

1269
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,080
I'm not...

1270
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:38,240
I'm...

1271
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,220
I cannot play...

1272
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,140
I think like I'm...

1273
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,480
I'm really bad at any melee character.

1274
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,100
Cause it goes against my programming.

1275
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,080
Cause I'm like...

1276
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:45,340
Why...

1277
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,560
Like I can nearly just shoot you.

1278
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,060
Like...

1279
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,700
I can be like...

1280
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,060
50 miles away and just shoot you.

1281
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:54,840
Like...

1282
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,980
And I'll be okay.

1283
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,380
We want Luna.

1284
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,480
There's nothing!

1285
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,380
I don't have skins here!

1286
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,820
I don't have skins on this account!

1287
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:07,260
We don't have a Luna summer skin!

1288
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,800
I just...

1289
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,820
I just have the debuff.

1290
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:17,580
I can't...

1291
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:17,960
What was it?

1292
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,240
I don't have the power of anime on my side.

1293
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,520
Even though I'm an anime girl.

1294
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,540
I don't...

1295
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,600
What is this?

1296
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,040
I showed the team already, but...

1297
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,020
Basically it's like...

1298
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:30,460
Lifesteal.

1299
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,040
So I link...

1300
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,260
And then...

1301
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,160
I get Lifesteal.

1302
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,740
Then get it!

1303
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:37,600
Okay.

1304
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,060
Okay.

1305
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:38,480
Fine!

1306
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,380
Fine!

1307
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,280
I have free money on this account!

1308
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,420
Cause it's not mine anyway.

1309
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,020
Uh...

1310
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:45,820
Luna...

1311
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,580
Alright...

1312
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,800
Cosmetic...

1313
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,380
I think it's...

1314
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:50,900
This one?

1315
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,200
Yeah.

1316
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:53,760
Alright...

1317
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,660
Purchase premium...

1318
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,720
And then...

1319
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,540
Oh my gosh...

1320
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:01,940
The thong...

1321
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:02,620
Oh my god!

1322
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,620
Okay guys, but not gonna lie though...

1323
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,760
Like...

1324
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,540
Now that I'm here anyway...

1325
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:08,940
Um...

1326
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:09,600
I think...

1327
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,780
I think this is not...

1328
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,020
Cos...

1329
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:15,360
I...

1330
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,640
Legitimately think this is their best low-key skin.

1331
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,970
Because like...

1332
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,600
When you go...

1333
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,680
When you go...

1334
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,540
When you go this way...

1335
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,520
Like you can...

1336
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,080
Like...

1337
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:30,100
Like...

1338
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,860
Okay...

1339
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:33,920
Anyway...

1340
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,260
Uh...

1341
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:37,600
When you do the side shot...

1342
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,400
Like you're...

1343
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:42,500
All right, let's get the... I have enough.

1344
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:47,400
How much is the... Oh, I definitely have enough.

1345
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:47,820
Okay.

1346
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,900
Where the fuck is the... Oh, there you go.

1347
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,000
Okay.

1348
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,720
So much.

1349
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,300
What do you mean?

1350
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,480
All right.

1351
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:05,040
I... Do... Okay, I'm gonna say it.

1352
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,560
I think...

1353
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,280
I think her default skin is her best skin.

1354
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,820
Out of all of the skins she has.

1355
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,180
Not a fan of the hair color.

1356
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:19,480
I would say... I will say... I will say... Oh my gosh.

1357
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,920
The swimsuit design is really pretty.

1358
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,720
But... Do I have enough?

1359
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,340
Oh, I do.

1360
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:33,200
I just don't like the... The hair color.

1361
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,620
But I like this.

1362
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,160
I like this swimsuit design.

1363
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:36,780
I like this color.

1364
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,440
But...

1365
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:38,980
I don't know.

1366
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,120
There's just something about it.

1367
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,800
I think her default skin is the prettiest though.

1368
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,060
Out of all of the colors.

1369
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,280
Of all the skins that she has.

1370
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,400
But like...

1371
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:54,300
I want the pink or... I'll do pink and blue.

1372
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,760
It's like cotton candy.

1373
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,200
I like cotton candy.

1374
00:38:59,150 --> 00:38:59,960
All right.

1375
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,000
Are you happy now?

1376
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,260
Are you happy?

1377
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,060
Have you been fed enough?

1378
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,420
Have you been fed?

1379
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:08,940
Chat.

1380
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,340
Now you won't starve.

1381
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,240
Finally some good fucking food.

1382
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,260
All right.

1383
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,680
Let me make sure that I got everything.

1384
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:23,720
Oh yeah.

1385
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:24,280
By the way.

1386
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,360
It is free to play.

1387
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,760
For those who have never played Marvel Rivals before.

1388
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,620
It is free to play.

1389
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,980
And all the heroes you can unlock.

1390
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,340
You can literally unlock right now.

1391
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,560
So it's not like...

1392
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,940
It's not gatekept by anything.

1393
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:38,300
So yeah.

1394
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:41,520
You can literally play any of the heroes that I'm checking out right now.

1395
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:42,340
All right.

1396
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,080
So...

1397
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,940
I just need to make sure...

1398
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,400
If I got everything I have to do.

1399
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,160
All right.

1400
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,020
Technically we have to get ready for the show match now.

1401
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,880
We never say no to dessert.

1402
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:57,900
All right.

1403
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:58,500
Let's see.

1404
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,920
Custom game.

1405
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,600
I think...

1406
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:01,960
Wait.

1407
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:02,900
It's 12 to 12.

1408
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,560
How did 12 out of 12 already?

1409
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,180
Is this?

1410
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:12,280
Yeah.

1411
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,220
There it is.

1412
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,320
Wait.

1413
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,840
I hope this is not a random room.

1414
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,180
Oh.

1415
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:20,760
Player test.

1416
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,000
Yeah.

1417
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:21,280
Okay.

1418
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:21,560
Yeah.

1419
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:21,880
Okay.

1420
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,360
I'm in.

1421
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,220
I was like...

1422
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:26,140
I hope I didn't join a random room.

1423
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:30,500
Okay.

1424
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,960
Well, there's only two people there.

1425
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,420
So I don't have to be there yet.

1426
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:35,100
Nice.

1427
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:35,540
All right.

1428
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,320
You guys want to see...

1429
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:36,480
Okay.

1430
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,380
Any new...

1431
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,500
This is like the new pass.

1432
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,620
The Queen Codex.

1433
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,640
Um...

1434
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,320
So it's just...

1435
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,120
Get ready to...

1436
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:42,800
The...

1437
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,840
It's the Widow skin.

1438
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,240
And then there's the...

1439
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,460
There's the spray here.

1440
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,280
And...

1441
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,300
Nameplate.

1442
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,320
The...

1443
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,280
Symbiotic 4.

1444
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:53,820
The...

1445
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:54,520
Gallery card.

1446
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,580
Coming soon.

1447
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,160
Coming soon means it's coming soon.

1448
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,840
Not that you can, like, do anything with it.

1449
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:00,970
There's the...

1450
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,640
The emojis.

1451
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,720
Gallery card.

1452
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,640
The nameplate.

1453
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,900
Don King Kong.

1454
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,360
Uh...

1455
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,860
There's the Venom thing.

1456
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,220
The symbiotic thing.

1457
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,840
And then I think this one's sick.

1458
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,480
I really like this Hella skin.

1459
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,240
A lot.

1460
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,320
I think the skin is really, really good.

1461
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,380
Um...

1462
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:26,200
Out of all the Hella costumes, this one's like the best one.

1463
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,440
I feel like.

1464
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,600
Oh my god.

1465
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,060
It's coming soon, Spray?

1466
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,580
Oh my god.

1467
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,440
Ha ha ha.

1468
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:33,860
Ha ha.

1469
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,340
Ha ha.

1470
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:36,540
Ha ha.

1471
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:36,620
Ha ha.

1472
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,080
That's something for me.

1473
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,760
Okay, we gotta go in the voice chat now.

1474
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:47,430
That's what I'm talking about.

1475
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:49,970
Season 3.5 on August 8th.

1476
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,390
That's a week from now.

1477
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:52,730
Wait, am I stupid?

1478
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,390
I thought it was August 22nd.

1479
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:55,070
Nope.

1480
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:55,950
It's August 8th.

1481
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:56,690
Whoops, guys.

1482
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:57,450
It's August 8th.

1483
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:57,730
All right.

1484
00:41:57,930 --> 00:41:58,730
Good luck, Sound Team.

1485
00:41:59,010 --> 00:41:59,410
Good luck.

1486
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:03,850
I'm meeting myself while I get the foogies up or the Discord stuff.

1487
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:04,410
She just mogged you, buddy.

1488
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:05,510
She just mogged me.

1489
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:06,330
She's ignoring us.

1490
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:06,910
That's crazy.

1491
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:08,030
She don't care, buddy.

1492
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:09,070
All right.

1493
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:09,370
It's okay.

1494
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:11,330
That's life sometimes, isn't it?

1495
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:12,530
Sometimes you'd be like that.

1496
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:13,070
She doesn't know you.

1497
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:14,210
No, bro.

1498
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:15,470
Also, no, bro.

1499
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:16,590
No, bro's important in there as well.

1500
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:18,150
That's okay, guys.

1501
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:21,530
I think I'm going to join the wrong one.

1502
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:21,670
Okay.

1503
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:22,850
I'm here.

1504
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:23,530
Make it for you.

1505
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:25,650
I joined it.

1506
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:26,570
For you.

1507
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:27,510
The voices.

1508
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:28,390
What do they say?

1509
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:29,890
I mean, maybe for me, but...

1510
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:31,370
What do the voices say, guys?

1511
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:33,210
Yeah, maybe I could cook.

1512
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:35,990
Which lobby am I supposed to be in?

1513
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:37,530
I'm trying to figure this out.

1514
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:38,830
It might be a lane type of character.

1515
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:41,570
A me type of character?

1516
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:43,950
Guys, I'm just trying to fix this real quick.

1517
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:46,110
Because tank players don't like anti-heal.

1518
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:47,770
Wait, which one are we supposed to join?

1519
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:49,270
Is it this one?

1520
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:49,850
Guys, it's a lobby.

1521
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,130
No, that's the wrong one.

1522
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:53,310
Is it this one?

1523
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:53,990
I'm not joining the slow.

1524
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:55,270
Okay, this is the right one.

1525
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:56,710
The slow isn't that strong, but the...

1526
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:58,710
The reduced healing is going to be really broken.

1527
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:00,650
Okay, I gotta figure out the fookie, guys.

1528
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:01,550
It's been a while.

1529
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:03,790
It seems like it's like...

1530
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:06,530
These days, it'd be the only one to get an actual pick without...

1531
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:07,650
The headshot or something, right?

1532
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:09,450
Like anti-healing.

1533
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:11,670
Oh my god, guys, it's bad.

1534
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:13,410
The fookie's not working.

1535
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:14,650
It's bad.

1536
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:17,310
Okay, wait, I can fix this.

1537
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:22,870
I think you just spam your shotgun, and if any tank gets close, then you start anti-healing them, and then shotgun.

1538
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:23,650
I can't fix this.

1539
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:24,690
Okay, guys, I can fix this.

1540
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:26,490
I think the shotgun's going to be the main damage.

1541
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:30,110
I'm going to be the invite.

1542
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:32,230
The lifesteal isn't as much.

1543
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:34,430
Go to custom game, and then...

1544
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:37,170
Season 3.5 starts on August 8th.

1545
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:38,550
Where is the server?

1546
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:40,230
Okay, global nickname.

1547
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,370
Okay, all right, good luck, everybody.

1548
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:44,650
You're going to try and figure out...

1549
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:47,850
Season 3.5 starts, August 8th, free time.

1550
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:50,110
Oh my god, there's so many voices.

1551
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:53,010
My head!

1552
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,910
What do the voices say?

1553
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:57,670
Oh man, Negros is here again?

1554
00:43:57,810 --> 00:43:58,430
She just tries, man.

1555
00:43:59,130 --> 00:43:59,670
Yeah, we gotta win.

1556
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:01,450
Yes!

1557
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:03,710
Damn, you said it, not me.

1558
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:05,030
Yeah, we gotta win.

1559
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:06,030
Wait, wait.

1560
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:07,890
Why is my Fugi not working?

1561
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:09,670
Fugi, please!

1562
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:12,490
There's too many!

1563
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:13,170
Oh, there it is.

1564
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:14,110
Guys, it's working.

1565
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:15,890
Okay, there they are.

1566
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:17,830
They're very tiny, but there they are.

1567
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:18,290
Yes, not me.

1568
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:22,050
There they are.

1569
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:24,290
Wait, does that mean I can do this now?

1570
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:25,810
XCC, you gotta press the button.

1571
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:27,070
No, oh my god, it only has...

1572
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:28,730
You can only press the button.

1573
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:30,870
All right, good luck, everybody.

1574
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:31,530
Good job.

1575
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:32,690
To figure everyone out.

1576
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:33,490
Good luck.

1577
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:35,590
I believe in all of you.

1578
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:36,030
It's okay.

1579
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:36,630
I don't...

1580
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:36,670
I don't...

1581
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:36,810
I don't...

1582
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:37,530
I don't scream like you guys.

1583
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:39,130
I don't scream either.

1584
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:40,190
Name it high.

1585
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:43,690
I switched up on my day one, that's what I do, though.

1586
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:44,890
All right.

1587
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:46,110
This is why I switched up on the Loxie.

1588
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:48,050
As soon as I reach you, I have a success, I...

1589
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:48,770
Sorry, guys.

1590
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:49,910
I can't translate for you.

1591
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:50,390
I'm just...

1592
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:51,690
I'm trying to figure this out.

1593
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:52,370
What are you just meaning?

1594
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:54,150
I can't...

1595
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:54,650
Oh!

1596
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:57,130
Why'd he go?

1597
00:44:57,390 --> 00:45:00,370
All right, my sound team is figuring out how to sound balance everything.

1598
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:00,650
Rice?

1599
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:01,630
Fried chicken?

1600
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:02,490
Just...

1601
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:02,790
Just...

1602
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:03,170
And ketchup?

1603
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:04,390
Yum.

1604
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:07,370
All right.

1605
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:07,770
I love ketchup.

1606
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:09,390
I'm trying to figure it out.

1607
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:10,190
Mustard.

1608
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:10,490
It's goaded.

1609
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:10,690
It's goaded.

1610
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:10,730
It's goaded.

1611
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:10,810
It's goaded.

1612
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:11,070
It's goaded.

1613
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:13,130
They're just talking about food!

1614
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:15,030
What is there to translate?

1615
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:15,810
Mustard!

1616
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:17,970
Okay, oh my god.

1617
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:19,430
Oh my god.

1618
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:20,150
Okay, turn.

1619
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:21,450
Sure for it down.

1620
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:22,510
Really set up for that one, huh?

1621
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:31,090
And then... Sound Team's office is on fire right now.

1622
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:35,190
We're trying to figure this out before we do anything.

1623
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:37,290
Why was that so ominous?

1624
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:44,170
I was, uh...

1625
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:45,950
Oh, classic.

1626
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:47,030
Okay.

1627
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:50,930
Sound Team is like, we're trying to figure this out right now.

1628
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:52,270
Oh, my gosh.

1629
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:55,550
Yeah, I mean, I'm kind of a peasant of humor.

1630
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:57,490
Like, you did it so well.

1631
00:45:57,590 --> 00:45:59,050
The delivery, it flew right under my nose.

1632
00:45:59,610 --> 00:45:59,710
Okay.

1633
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:02,770
Sure for it's still louder than Moxie.

1634
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:03,770
How is that possible?

1635
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:08,450
Moxie has not upgraded his mic since 2015.

1636
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:09,790
15.

1637
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:14,570
So, I'm waiting on humor.

1638
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:16,750
I, like, have an XQC translator in my chat.

1639
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:17,790
Andrew.

1640
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:19,370
Andrew, the Venom OTP.

1641
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:25,010
Yeah, you guys, like, busted or not?

1642
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:25,810
Not much.

1643
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:29,790
I'm super excited to play Marvel Rivals Season 3.5.

1644
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:31,050
Who are you going to be playing?

1645
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:31,490
Oh, yippee!

1646
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:35,470
I'm going to be playing Cloak and Dagger or Lunas...

1647
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:36,110
Oh, my gosh.

1648
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:38,430
Hey, when is Season 3.5 coming out, guys?

1649
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:39,670
August 8th.

1650
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:40,190
I know this one.

1651
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:40,750
August 8th.

1652
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:41,330
August 8th.

1653
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:45,190
And what is the new character that they're adding for this new season?

1654
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:45,670
Blade.

1655
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:47,070
Oh, my gosh.

1656
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:49,150
Yippee.

1657
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:50,890
Like, from the movie?

1658
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:52,710
Yeah, like, from the movie.

1659
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:56,410
And do I have to pay to play Marvel Rivals?

1660
00:46:57,310 --> 00:46:58,490
No, it's for free.

1661
00:46:58,710 --> 00:46:59,590
Oh, my gosh.

1662
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:00,290
For free?

1663
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:01,830
For free, guys.

1664
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:03,550
And the character is also free.

1665
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:04,530
You don't have to pay for it.

1666
00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:05,370
Wow.

1667
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:07,150
Wow, fascinating.

1668
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:08,910
That is so interesting, guys.

1669
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:12,470
And anyone can download it right now with the links posted in our description.

1670
00:47:13,850 --> 00:47:15,130
It's in the pinned message.

1671
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:16,530
Or the pinned message.

1672
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:19,410
All right.

1673
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:20,650
Moxie up a bit.

1674
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:21,530
XTC down.

1675
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:22,730
Fanfan down.

1676
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:23,470
Moxie up.

1677
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:25,730
In the endgame lobbies voice comms because...

1678
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:26,450
Moxie up.

1679
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:31,630
...upgraded voice comms system, there's monitoring and moderating in-game.

1680
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:32,650
Yippee!

1681
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:33,610
No more slurs.

1682
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:34,330
Yippee!

1683
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:35,630
No more slurs, guys.

1684
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:36,590
Isn't that great?

1685
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:41,610
I decided to say for chats, so I can filter the words switch and swap when I'm playing Flank Adam.

1686
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:43,430
Ooh, that's really smart.

1687
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:47,490
As long as I can still say Clanker, I'm good.

1688
00:47:48,350 --> 00:47:49,830
Whoa, with the hard R?

1689
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:52,510
Yeah, I mean, it's the only way to do it.

1690
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:55,490
You don't want to be a Clanker.

1691
00:47:57,150 --> 00:47:57,730
Clanker.

1692
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:01,410
Okay, uh...

1693
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:02,750
I'm fine with Clankers.

1694
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:04,090
You guys are all level 1, dubs.

1695
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:04,510
Booger down.

1696
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:05,670
Fanfan down.

1697
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:07,650
XTC down.

1698
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:09,570
How did you get level 2?

1699
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:11,230
I'm just going to turn Discord down.

1700
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:12,530
Whoa.

1701
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:16,190
You were grinding into Moxie's a good intro.

1702
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:18,050
All right, let me know if it's better, Soundteam.

1703
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:20,550
He's crying so hard.

1704
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:23,930
As a robot, I am deeply offended.

1705
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:28,030
He didn't get the pass, guys.

1706
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:29,890
All right, let me know, Soundgat.

1707
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:30,450
It was better.

1708
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:31,390
Yay.

1709
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:34,970
I can't do my usual, like, Discord overlay.

1710
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:38,870
Usually I do a thing where it just bounces, but for some reason it's not working.

1711
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,220
It's, like, so iffy sometimes.

1712
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:48,160
It doesn't show up.

1713
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:49,520
All right.

1714
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,600
Moxie, how you got 11 MS?

1715
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:53,920
You want me to low...

1716
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,560
Wait, Soundgat, you want me to lower Moxie or up Moxie?

1717
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:57,480
I don't understand.

1718
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:59,920
If he's going to be quiet or too loud.

1719
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:02,220
Wait, why did he ask for ready and then not start, Sus?

1720
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:03,320
Oh, up Moxie.

1721
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:03,620
Okay.

1722
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:04,900
Strange.

1723
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:06,340
Doctor.

1724
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:06,680
Stephen?

1725
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:07,320
Strange.

1726
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:08,740
I'm opening a portal.

1727
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:09,560
I'm opening a portal.

1728
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,860
All right, I'm up Moxie.

1729
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:12,920
Hmm.

1730
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:16,770
All right.

1731
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:17,090
Anyway.

1732
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:19,690
So, what's up with the...

1733
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:20,350
My XUC translator got everything.

1734
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:21,170
You, um...

1735
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:22,670
You chillin'?

1736
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:23,550
What are you doing these days?

1737
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:24,290
Your hobbies?

1738
00:49:24,810 --> 00:49:26,010
My personal life?

1739
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:27,670
Yeah, you got hobbies and shit like that?

1740
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:28,330
And stuff like that?

1741
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:28,810
Not really.

1742
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:30,150
Why not?

1743
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:33,130
Um, I get a little bit lazy.

1744
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:36,550
Why do you do nothing?

1745
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:39,470
Why don't you have a personality outside of streaming?

1746
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:41,570
Yeah, man.

1747
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:43,450
Wait, what are your hobbies?

1748
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:44,370
Oh, wait!

1749
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:45,670
I actually know your hobby.

1750
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:46,870
I've watched...

1751
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:48,110
I really like your music making.

1752
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:48,870
Thank you.

1753
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:49,430
Yeah, I make music.

1754
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:50,110
I drive.

1755
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:50,970
I race.

1756
00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:51,690
And stuff like that.

1757
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:52,990
Wait, what's your DJ name?

1758
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:53,890
I love your music stuff.

1759
00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:54,190
Yeah.

1760
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:55,470
What's your producer name?

1761
00:49:56,510 --> 00:49:57,230
Uh, DTN.

1762
00:49:57,990 --> 00:49:58,450
What's the sound?

1763
00:49:58,450 --> 00:49:58,990
DJ Toenail.

1764
00:49:59,450 --> 00:49:59,850
Yeah.

1765
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:02,810
Do you have a SoundCloud?

1766
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:06,050
Yeah, it's building slowly.

1767
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:06,870
It's building slowly.

1768
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:09,350
Yeah, what's your number one hit?

1769
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:13,110
Number one hit is, um...

1770
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:13,710
All of them.

1771
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:15,030
They're all really good.

1772
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:16,590
You put a producer...

1773
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:17,610
Do you have a Spotify?

1774
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:20,090
No, yeah.

1775
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:21,030
I'm not approved yet.

1776
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:21,810
I'm not approved.

1777
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:28,330
What answer is when producers have a specific sound they play in their songs?

1778
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:29,030
Producer tag.

1779
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:30,110
Oh, yeah.

1780
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:30,470
Oh, yeah.

1781
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:30,750
Oh, yeah.

1782
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:32,890
Do you shout out your name like DJ Khaled?

1783
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:33,430
I thought a producer tag was just their name.

1784
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:34,850
DJ Khaled.

1785
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:35,990
DJ Khaled.

1786
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:36,610
DJ Khaled.

1787
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:38,050
We the best.

1788
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:38,850
Guys, we're starting.

1789
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:40,510
All right.

1790
00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:41,190
Thank you.

1791
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:43,090
What team up are we going to do?

1792
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:43,450
We're going to play Blade.

1793
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:44,010
Me.

1794
00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:47,170
We can do Cloak and Blade team up first.

1795
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:48,330
That's crazy.

1796
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:50,790
Also, guys, if you have skins, equip the skins.

1797
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:51,570
I can do...

1798
00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:53,230
Don't worry.

1799
00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:53,630
I got my skin.

1800
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:55,130
I want to get a Cloak and Dagger skin.

1801
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:56,570
I got my skin.

1802
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:56,930
Oh, he's talking.

1803
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:57,870
We moxie are in game.

1804
00:50:58,850 --> 00:50:58,970
He's only talking game.

1805
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:01,090
He's only talking game.

1806
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:12,330
He's embarrassing.

1807
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:14,290
Because they buffed it, right?

1808
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:16,710
Yeah, they did.

1809
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:18,570
Overall, healing is better.

1810
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:19,610
Your Ruthman heals more.

1811
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:20,990
It gives more shields too.

1812
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:22,410
That's hot.

1813
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:24,910
Although, it's a group wall.

1814
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:26,510
The healing Groot is pretty good.

1815
00:51:27,290 --> 00:51:27,690
Wait.

1816
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:28,170
I'm confused.

1817
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:29,970
C gives me another wall.

1818
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:31,410
Yeah, that's a heal wall.

1819
00:51:31,450 --> 00:51:32,330
That wall only heals.

1820
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:33,530
Yeah, you only get one though.

1821
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:34,270
You just hide it.

1822
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:36,590
You just hide it and you heal the entire team and you farm your Ruth.

1823
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:37,310
And it lasts forever.

1824
00:51:38,110 --> 00:51:38,490
Yeah.

1825
00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:39,590
I think it's pretty OP.

1826
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:41,770
Yeah, you just hide it and it just sits there.

1827
00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:42,930
How do you know that?

1828
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:45,150
Because we were in the practice range.

1829
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:48,450
Were you not in the practice range?

1830
00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:54,110
What did you do in the first 40 minutes, XTC?

1831
00:51:56,590 --> 00:52:01,690
You guys missed when XTC was in the voice chat with me and said, Guys, do I have to watch anything or do anything?

1832
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:03,690
Can I just wait for 40 minutes?

1833
00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:06,050
Do the team up.

1834
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:06,530
Do the team up.

1835
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:08,470
Oh, shit.

1836
00:52:09,010 --> 00:52:09,370
Oh.

1837
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:10,590
Oh, my God.

1838
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:11,410
Now, say it.

1839
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:13,910
This guy put it on European server.

1840
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:17,350
Wait, is he going to live?

1841
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:18,010
Yeah.

1842
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:18,430
I'm betting.

1843
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:19,610
Send me to the death.

1844
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:20,930
Yeah, I was going to say.

1845
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:21,950
Is he going to die?

1846
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:23,150
He's killing me.

1847
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:24,850
I was actually thinking about that RP from the movie.

1848
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:25,470
If you already know.

1849
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:26,950
I might be dying, guys.

1850
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:27,190
Okay?

1851
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:28,670
Oh, my God.

1852
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:29,650
No, we were pretty dead.

1853
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:31,130
So, he's just going to play.

1854
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:33,230
He's just going to play this character.

1855
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:35,230
So, he's just going to do that.

1856
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:37,230
Yeah, can't believe it.

1857
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:39,090
I'm not a team player.

1858
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:40,090
He's going on me.

1859
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:41,250
My controls are wrong.

1860
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:42,030
Wait.

1861
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:43,690
I mean, you didn't set him up, no?

1862
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:45,510
Yeah, I know he didn't.

1863
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:48,510
It's fixed.

1864
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:48,990
It's fixed.

1865
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:53,110
Yeah, because when you're on our new accounts, they're all new accounts.

1866
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:54,290
So, we have to reset our settings.

1867
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:54,810
Send me again.

1868
00:52:56,430 --> 00:52:56,970
Send me again.

1869
00:52:56,970 --> 00:52:57,370
Send me again.

1870
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:57,790
Send me again.

1871
00:52:57,850 --> 00:52:58,710
I'm going to fucking die.

1872
00:52:58,850 --> 00:52:59,690
Well, we need a team here.

1873
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:00,710
Okay.

1874
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:03,610
My team up is on a 30 second cooldown.

1875
00:53:03,610 --> 00:53:04,510
All right.

1876
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:05,590
Oh, my goodness.

1877
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:05,950
All right, buddy.

1878
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:07,610
Okay, guys.

1879
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:08,410
Heal the Venom.

1880
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:11,150
He's stuck in my walls.

1881
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:12,410
He's anti-healed.

1882
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:13,050
Yeah.

1883
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:14,890
Your damage boost, Maxi?

1884
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:17,370
Yeah, I'm watching.

1885
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:18,150
I need a little bit of assistance.

1886
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:19,130
I'm anti-healed.

1887
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:19,910
I'm getting cooked.

1888
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:20,910
Oh, no.

1889
00:53:21,370 --> 00:53:21,490
Wait.

1890
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:21,990
You're fine.

1891
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:22,270
You're fine.

1892
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:22,550
You're fine.

1893
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:23,390
You're so healthy.

1894
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:24,070
Nice.

1895
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:25,430
We have to walk through the wall.

1896
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:28,410
I'm anti-healed.

1897
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:30,110
I got my ultimate.

1898
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:31,810
Oh, beautiful.

1899
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:33,070
I'm ulting on to side.

1900
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:33,470
Nice.

1901
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:34,150
I'm going to backline.

1902
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:34,810
Kill the Mantis.

1903
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:35,330
Kill the Mantis.

1904
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:36,330
Oh, my God.

1905
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:37,010
We're going to get eaten.

1906
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:38,250
Oh, Venom cut.

1907
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:38,910
Sorry.

1908
00:53:39,110 --> 00:53:39,410
Wait.

1909
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:40,270
Who got eaten?

1910
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:41,630
I did it.

1911
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:42,230
I didn't say it.

1912
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:44,090
I'm slicing and dicing right now.

1913
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:45,050
Keep slicing.

1914
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:45,570
Keep slicing.

1915
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:47,170
Keep slicing.

1916
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:47,450
Keep slicing.

1917
00:53:47,450 --> 00:53:48,070
We're anti-healed.

1918
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:51,270
We're so much better.

1919
00:53:51,370 --> 00:53:52,290
We're so good, guys.

1920
00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:54,350
I don't know what happened, but we're so good.

1921
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:56,370
Okay, Maxi, can you send me again?

1922
00:53:56,370 --> 00:53:57,590
I'm busy, I'm like a lion.

1923
00:53:57,690 --> 00:53:58,630
Yep, I'm ready.

1924
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:00,070
We'll walk in.

1925
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:00,970
Wait, we're going to...

1926
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:02,410
We can burn blade ult.

1927
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:03,470
Nothing can survive.

1928
00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:04,350
Wait, that's so true.

1929
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:06,490
Wait, can I damage boost the ult?

1930
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:07,530
Or no?

1931
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:08,830
Oh, this is going to be sick.

1932
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:11,250
Wait, there's a Venom near me.

1933
00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:12,050
There's a Venom up here.

1934
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:13,970
I'm with you.

1935
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:14,630
I'm with you.

1936
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:14,850
I'm with you.

1937
00:54:14,930 --> 00:54:15,350
I'm with you.

1938
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:16,550
I'm with you.

1939
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:18,010
All the Mantis, all the Mantis.

1940
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:19,410
Guys, a little bit of help.

1941
00:54:20,830 --> 00:54:22,050
I damage boosted you.

1942
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:23,650
Oh, shit.

1943
00:54:25,090 --> 00:54:25,990
Okay, I wasn't ready.

1944
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:27,630
No.

1945
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:29,190
Wait, did you not do it?

1946
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:29,490
I will die.

1947
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:31,950
I did it, but I think I did it too late.

1948
00:54:32,830 --> 00:54:33,650
Wait, it's not winnable.

1949
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:33,770
Wait, it's not winnable.

1950
00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:36,250
No, we win this.

1951
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:39,770
Honestly, I blame the EU lag.

1952
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:40,830
Wait, mostly popping out.

1953
00:54:40,990 --> 00:54:41,710
They're low, they're low.

1954
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:43,050
Pull up, pull up, pull up.

1955
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:43,570
Nice TP.

1956
00:54:44,350 --> 00:54:44,550
Go TP.

1957
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:44,650
Thanks, man.

1958
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:45,130
Go TP.

1959
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:46,830
Thanks, thanks, thanks.

1960
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:48,510
Who's Groot?

1961
00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:49,830
The hunt is on.

1962
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:51,470
Anti-heal him?

1963
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:51,830
Anti-heal.

1964
00:54:52,010 --> 00:54:52,770
Oh, quick.

1965
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:53,470
I'm on Venom.

1966
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:54,990
Venom half.

1967
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:56,570
I'll point, I'll point, I'll point, I'll point.

1968
00:54:56,690 --> 00:54:57,530
Kill the Venom, I'll point.

1969
00:54:57,910 --> 00:54:58,190
Come on, right?

1970
00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:00,050
Sucking him off, sucking him off, sucking him off.

1971
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:00,870
Nice, nice.

1972
00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:01,470
I didn't do that.

1973
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:01,930
Nice, nice.

1974
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:02,570
Do you like that?

1975
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:03,650
Gee, where is that?

1976
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:04,470
Nice.

1977
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:05,090
You guys like that.

1978
00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:07,230
Oh, they like capped it a little bit.

1979
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:08,250
Wait, they went triple support.

1980
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:10,030
Oh, they want to win.

1981
00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:12,670
I mean, good thing we have a character that reduces healing, you know?

1982
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:13,770
Yeah, true.

1983
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:14,390
It's just true.

1984
00:55:16,610 --> 00:55:19,310
We can do cloak ult first, since you...

1985
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:20,310
If you get yours before.

1986
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:21,330
I don't have it yet.

1987
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:21,890
If you get it.

1988
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:23,570
Okay, I will...

1989
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:24,230
I will...

1990
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:26,090
My shotgun's kind of...

1991
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:26,530
Blinded!

1992
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:28,230
Oh, they got a second, they got a second.

1993
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:29,590
Nice.

1994
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:30,690
Nice cut.

1995
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:31,810
I got it.

1996
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:32,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah, she has it.

1997
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:33,650
Venom anti-healed, running away.

1998
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:35,150
Weak, coward.

1999
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:37,270
I got you, let's see.

2000
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:40,770
Oh, wait.

2001
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:43,510
I got it.

2002
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:45,970
I got it.

2003
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:46,390
I got it.

2004
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:48,330
You have all or no?

2005
00:55:48,890 --> 00:55:50,450
Oh, you're fine, you're fine, you're fine.

2006
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:51,290
I'm doing it.

2007
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:51,730
Stabilized.

2008
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:52,010
Stabilized.

2009
00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:52,710
We are a little bit low.

2010
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:54,950
Oh, they got to be low.

2011
00:55:56,010 --> 00:55:56,970
Oh, my God.

2012
00:55:57,310 --> 00:55:57,870
I missed everybody.

2013
00:55:58,150 --> 00:55:58,910
No, I didn't like this.

2014
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:00,470
Oh, okay.

2015
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:01,170
Get my goob.

2016
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:01,770
Okay, good.

2017
00:56:02,410 --> 00:56:03,670
There's a Venom behind us.

2018
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:04,430
He's asleep.

2019
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:05,030
Goop's gone.

2020
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:05,650
He's asleep.

2021
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:07,210
That's a big one.

2022
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:09,110
That's a big boy.

2023
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:09,950
That's a big boy.

2024
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:12,290
Oh, my God.

2025
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:12,770
You're okay.

2026
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:13,590
I can't block the fall.

2027
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:14,610
I can't block the fall.

2028
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:15,210
I can't block the fall.

2029
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:16,810
I can't see you.

2030
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:17,830
It's okay.

2031
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:19,090
It's fine.

2032
00:56:19,390 --> 00:56:19,950
We're so low.

2033
00:56:19,970 --> 00:56:20,750
I dashed out.

2034
00:56:20,870 --> 00:56:21,230
I dashed out.

2035
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:23,770
Oh, I'm in it.

2036
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:24,330
No.

2037
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:30,460
It's okay.

2038
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,840
We have another portal, right?

2039
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:32,860
No.

2040
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:35,140
We do have a portal.

2041
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:36,400
We do have a portal.

2042
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:37,160
We need it.

2043
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:37,660
You got to run.

2044
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:38,740
Okay, I'm going.

2045
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:39,640
I can't stall.

2046
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:39,960
I can't stall.

2047
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:40,540
I can't stall.

2048
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:40,960
Sprinting.

2049
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:41,700
I'm running.

2050
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:42,560
I'm running to you.

2051
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:43,800
Oh, you have to time it.

2052
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:46,820
Oh, my God.

2053
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:47,900
I'm giving you all my seeds.

2054
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:49,880
He's asleep.

2055
00:56:56,190 --> 00:56:56,990
I'm touching.

2056
00:56:57,210 --> 00:56:57,570
I'm touching.

2057
00:56:57,830 --> 00:56:58,010
I'm dead.

2058
00:56:58,770 --> 00:56:59,130
I'm going point.

2059
00:56:59,490 --> 00:56:59,890
Give me a sec.

2060
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:00,370
I'm almost there.

2061
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:06,870
Winnable or lower?

2062
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:08,230
Oh, no.

2063
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:09,090
Oh, no.

2064
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:10,690
Oh, no.

2065
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:12,410
That shit ain't winnable.

2066
00:57:15,370 --> 00:57:16,550
It's just warm up, right?

2067
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:17,830
We're just warming up.

2068
00:57:18,290 --> 00:57:19,030
Yeah, we're warming up.

2069
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:20,090
Just like practicing scrims, guys.

2070
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:21,290
Just remember what we talked about.

2071
00:57:21,590 --> 00:57:23,970
Yeah, we were all just configuring our settings and senses.

2072
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:30,190
Of course, I forgot to get a skin, so that must be impacting my gameplay.

2073
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:31,470
That is true.

2074
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:34,730
Oh, yeah.

2075
00:57:34,810 --> 00:57:35,550
I figured out the buttons.

2076
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:37,530
Moxie, play the Hella with the see-through cape.

2077
00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:39,590
Oh, I love that skin.

2078
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:41,850
They're going to make me unleash.

2079
00:57:41,850 --> 00:57:42,510
I'm not going to lie.

2080
00:57:42,570 --> 00:57:43,690
They're trying too hard to...

2081
00:57:44,390 --> 00:57:45,150
You're going to lock in?

2082
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:46,510
Release me, dark magic.

2083
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:47,690
I'm locking him in now.

2084
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:48,890
Dark magic.

2085
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:49,610
Oh, my God.

2086
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:51,470
I'll play it.

2087
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:53,050
These inhibitors are off, guys.

2088
00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:53,830
You should be telling one trick.

2089
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:54,630
Yeah, no.

2090
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:55,290
I'm lost.

2091
00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:57,530
What are you saying, man?

2092
00:57:58,710 --> 00:58:00,170
Yeah, I didn't have roll input on.

2093
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:00,470
That's why.

2094
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:01,570
Hold on.

2095
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:02,390
I just got enabled by the team up.

2096
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:03,350
XTC is ascending.

2097
00:58:04,970 --> 00:58:05,370
Four.

2098
00:58:05,370 --> 00:58:06,110
Is it?

2099
00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:07,010
Two.

2100
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:07,930
One.

2101
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:10,930
All you need to do is capture the mission.

2102
00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:11,630
I believe you.

2103
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:12,790
Tips for Thor, by the way, sure.

2104
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:12,970
Four.

2105
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:22,670
Yeah, you awakening and then you spam at them and then you get builded again and spam at them and you go on to their backline and you E and then you all.

2106
00:58:23,130 --> 00:58:23,650
Okay, I'll try.

2107
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:25,770
Mid fight.

2108
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:26,530
Mid fight.

2109
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:27,690
Just go on their backline.

2110
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:32,170
Okay, I'm going into the backline.

2111
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:34,230
Oh, there's Groot Wasp.

2112
00:58:34,290 --> 00:58:34,930
We can't get to you.

2113
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:37,250
I'm watching Shirt 4.

2114
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:37,830
I got one.

2115
00:58:38,190 --> 00:58:38,950
Oh, I'm sorry.

2116
00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:40,210
I'm swapping.

2117
00:58:40,410 --> 00:58:40,810
I'm swapping.

2118
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:42,210
I'm backing out now.

2119
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:42,570
I'm winnable.

2120
00:58:43,470 --> 00:58:44,870
Oh, we're engaging.

2121
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:45,490
Winnable.

2122
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:47,690
Should I be the guy that pulls out Wolverine?

2123
00:58:48,330 --> 00:58:48,590
Yeah.

2124
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:49,750
Do it, do it.

2125
00:58:49,990 --> 00:58:50,750
Yeah, yeah.

2126
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:51,950
Be that guy.

2127
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:52,590
Be that guy, be him, be him.

2128
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:53,730
We ain't losing, bro.

2129
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:54,470
We ain't losing.

2130
00:58:54,550 --> 00:58:55,170
We ain't losing.

2131
00:58:55,810 --> 00:58:56,410
We got walled.

2132
00:58:56,510 --> 00:58:57,770
I'm going to get staggered.

2133
00:58:59,350 --> 00:58:59,910
Wait, unless...

2134
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:01,350
No, I'm dead.

2135
00:59:06,450 --> 00:59:07,450
Wait, you guys are alone.

2136
00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:09,290
Nah, you're kind of cooked.

2137
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:10,570
Yeah, you don't have supports with you.

2138
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:11,150
No, it's fine.

2139
00:59:11,390 --> 00:59:12,230
They didn't...

2140
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:12,290
Healing bubble.

2141
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:14,250
We're coming over.

2142
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:15,150
Get him, get him, get him.

2143
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:17,650
If I can use ult first.

2144
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:18,310
I'm lost.

2145
00:59:18,470 --> 00:59:18,550
Yeah.

2146
00:59:20,210 --> 00:59:21,150
I'm ulting, I'm ulting, I'm ulting.

2147
00:59:21,950 --> 00:59:22,410
Oh, there's going to be...

2148
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:23,150
Nice, nice ult.

2149
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:24,430
Woo, get in my ult.

2150
00:59:24,790 --> 00:59:25,470
Oh, my God.

2151
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:27,530
There is a group right behind us, by the way.

2152
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:28,490
Beautiful, beautiful.

2153
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:29,170
There's a group behind.

2154
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:29,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2155
00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:30,770
I gumbode with you.

2156
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:32,150
That's cool.

2157
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:32,830
I need going up.

2158
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:34,010
There is a venom on point.

2159
00:59:36,350 --> 00:59:37,130
Beat him.

2160
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:37,470
Nice.

2161
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:39,450
Guys, please shoot him, shoot him, shoot him, please.

2162
00:59:39,630 --> 00:59:40,230
I beg, I beg, I beg.

2163
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:41,270
I got denim, he's so far.

2164
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:41,890
You didn't save my bait.

2165
00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:43,070
Where is he going?

2166
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:44,310
Where am I going?

2167
00:59:44,930 --> 00:59:46,290
Oh, I quit all the time.

2168
00:59:46,370 --> 00:59:47,010
We got venom.

2169
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:47,790
Yeah?

2170
00:59:48,570 --> 00:59:49,250
We'll die!

2171
00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:51,310
I quit all the time.

2172
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:57,740
Okay, we're coming back.

2173
00:59:57,940 --> 00:59:58,840
Healers are coming back.

2174
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:01,440
Healers are coming back.

2175
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:03,180
I believe.

2176
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:05,020
Alright, I'm waiting, I'm waiting.

2177
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:06,180
Oh, I got this.

2178
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:06,660
I ain't using this.

2179
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:10,800
I would say, even though they buff Mantis, I don't know.

2180
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,980
I don't know, but it has a duo of support.

2181
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:16,680
It's fine.

2182
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:17,760
We win this.

2183
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:18,040
We win this.

2184
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:19,740
They're triple healing right now.

2185
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:20,060
Yeah.

2186
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:20,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2187
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:22,760
But we have a character that reduces healing, so, you know?

2188
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:23,440
Easy counter.

2189
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:24,300
Yeah.

2190
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:25,500
That's true, that's true.

2191
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:26,180
Right, right, right.

2192
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:26,620
Be on.

2193
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:29,020
I got...

2194
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:30,160
Oh my god!

2195
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:31,560
Oh my god, they just doubled.

2196
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:33,220
Kill this guy.

2197
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:34,660
He's one, he's one.

2198
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:35,320
Beautiful.

2199
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:35,520
Beautiful.

2200
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:36,420
Nice.

2201
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:40,420
This is our last fight pretty much, so...

2202
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:41,200
Yeah, this is last fight.

2203
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:41,700
We're not more walking out.

2204
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:43,720
I don't have enough heals right now.

2205
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,280
So it's up to...

2206
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:46,080
It's up to back.

2207
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:47,140
I'm healing my...

2208
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:48,360
I'm spamming.

2209
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:49,360
We have a winner.

2210
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:49,920
We have a winner.

2211
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:51,240
You just me up.

2212
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:55,300
I'm trying to keep...

2213
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:55,360
Oh my god.

2214
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,120
I'm trying to keep...

2215
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:57,640
Guys, get ready.

2216
01:00:58,940 --> 01:00:59,340
Nice.

2217
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:00,080
I'm ready.

2218
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:00,420
Nice.

2219
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:02,420
I'm ready as well.

2220
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:02,960
I'm pushing up.

2221
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:03,980
I'm killing you Loki.

2222
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:05,080
I got grabbed, guys.

2223
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:05,480
I missed.

2224
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:06,460
Loki TP.

2225
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:07,520
I slept.

2226
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:08,080
I slept Wolf.

2227
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:08,600
I slept Wolf.

2228
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:10,760
Mantis dead.

2229
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:11,620
Beautiful.

2230
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:12,440
Kill this Wolverine.

2231
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:13,040
I'm slicing and dicing.

2232
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:14,700
Yeah, slice and dice.

2233
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:16,720
Oh my...

2234
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:17,180
Through one.

2235
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:17,840
That's fine.

2236
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:18,660
Come back there, Jeff.

2237
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:19,180
They're on Wolverine.

2238
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:19,760
They're on Wolverine as well.

2239
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:21,820
They've been on Wolverine for a bit.

2240
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:22,720
You caught this.

2241
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,560
There is a Venom on...

2242
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:24,600
We can win this.

2243
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:25,380
Nice.

2244
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:27,020
I don't have kidnap for three.

2245
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:27,560
Venom half?

2246
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:29,820
He's just...

2247
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:30,520
I got soldered.

2248
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:31,460
I keep whooping him.

2249
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:32,800
He's just running.

2250
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:33,840
He's just running.

2251
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:34,340
He's just running.

2252
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:36,040
Wait, he left.

2253
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:36,660
We win this.

2254
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:37,020
We win this.

2255
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,920
Well, the born skilleting dad is tracking your numbers.

2256
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:41,000
Don't worry about this.

2257
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:42,140
The Gombo.

2258
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:43,660
The Gombo?

2259
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:44,020
Yeah.

2260
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:45,040
We gotta make sure you live.

2261
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:46,820
I'll live.

2262
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:49,100
Just press the E button.

2263
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:50,120
I think you survived.

2264
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:51,740
They're Groot's on top right.

2265
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:52,700
All right.

2266
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:54,780
He's gonna try to lob him.

2267
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:55,720
He's grabbed.

2268
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:56,080
He's grabbed.

2269
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:56,740
He's grabbed.

2270
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:58,120
How about the Groot?

2271
01:01:58,580 --> 01:01:59,000
Oh, he's blind.

2272
01:01:59,120 --> 01:01:59,540
He slept.

2273
01:01:59,740 --> 01:01:59,900
He slept.

2274
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:01,280
Venom blind.

2275
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:02,020
I'm ready for the ult.

2276
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:04,120
You only got one.

2277
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:04,700
It's not great.

2278
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:05,140
But it's fine.

2279
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:06,960
No, it's good.

2280
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:07,520
It's good.

2281
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:08,600
We win this.

2282
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:08,900
We win this.

2283
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:09,360
Let's kill the Mantis.

2284
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:10,200
There's as much as we need.

2285
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:11,560
Mantis, Mantis, Mantis.

2286
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:12,380
I need heals, I need heals.

2287
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:13,480
Bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble.

2288
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:14,420
Thank you.

2289
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:16,580
Venom.

2290
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:17,400
No passive?

2291
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:18,920
Oh, I'm shotgunning him.

2292
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:20,400
Oh, beautiful.

2293
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:21,400
Nice.

2294
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:22,900
Nice, we win.

2295
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:23,360
Nice.

2296
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,760
Short, smaller numbers than big numbers.

2297
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:28,300
Yeah, it's better to ult than not ult at all.

2298
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:30,380
Segmentation is way, way better.

2299
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:30,940
More efficient.

2300
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:32,920
We'll run into the ult.

2301
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:33,040
We'll run into the ult.

2302
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:35,860
You're damage boosted in here.

2303
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:37,440
Very nice.

2304
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:41,000
Wait, one of them is supposed to play in.

2305
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:43,280
Oh, there's a...

2306
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:47,080
They're trying to win.

2307
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:48,660
They're really one ult.

2308
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:49,660
It's fine.

2309
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:52,160
Oh my god.

2310
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:53,060
I'm so scared.

2311
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:55,300
I'm slicing and dicing.

2312
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:56,320
I'm slicing and dicing.

2313
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:57,280
Wait, group one, group one.

2314
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:57,880
Nice.

2315
01:02:57,900 --> 01:02:58,340
I got you.

2316
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:01,740
I got you.

2317
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:03,160
I got you.

2318
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:03,360
I got you.

2319
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:03,880
I got you.

2320
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:05,080
I got him up.

2321
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:05,360
Dead.

2322
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:06,380
Nice.

2323
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:07,060
Nice.

2324
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:08,080
Good fade.

2325
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:11,740
Guys, have another one on the suit.

2326
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,260
Don't worry, we only have Venom over here.

2327
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:15,960
We still have Venom over here.

2328
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,080
Guys, let's go cook the mantis.

2329
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:20,040
They realize one of them needs to play Blade.

2330
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:23,260
Just like staff DMs.

2331
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,080
Um, where's Blade?

2332
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:25,500
Feel better.

2333
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:26,320
Fight better.

2334
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:28,820
You're ult to the top for heart.

2335
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:29,200
Alright.

2336
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:31,120
Anti-healed.

2337
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:31,620
Anti-healed.

2338
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,120
Venom behind me.

2339
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:33,740
I have Gombo.

2340
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:34,380
I have Gombo.

2341
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:35,740
Uh, yeah.

2342
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:36,480
No, forget it.

2343
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:37,020
No, no.

2344
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:37,660
Gombo, no Gombo.

2345
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:39,340
We comboed.

2346
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:39,820
Nice.

2347
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:40,480
We comboed.

2348
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:42,600
You saw our ult.

2349
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:43,560
I already used it.

2350
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,260
Venom, Venom, Venom.

2351
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:47,980
Venom's doing that thing again.

2352
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:48,780
Damage boosted.

2353
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:49,660
Where is he?

2354
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,020
He got him, guys.

2355
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:51,280
He was running around.

2356
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:51,320
He was running around.

2357
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:51,660
He was running around.

2358
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:53,640
Rat!

2359
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:54,320
Nice.

2360
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:55,980
Did you say rat?

2361
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:57,580
Wait!

2362
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:59,000
Strange on the suit on me!

2363
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:00,080
I'm gonna be dead.

2364
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:00,160
I'm gonna be dead.

2365
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:01,740
He's a rat.

2366
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:02,680
He's a land shark.

2367
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:04,140
Land shark.

2368
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:10,140
Guys, there's a...

2369
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:10,360
There's a...

2370
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:10,660
There's a...

2371
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:10,800
There's a...

2372
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,420
Can we kill the...

2373
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:12,480
Oh my god.

2374
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:15,240
He came back so fast.

2375
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:16,440
Guys, kill the...

2376
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:16,800
He's coming back.

2377
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:18,680
I'm grabbing him.

2378
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:19,900
I anti-healed him.

2379
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:21,860
Moxie is fighting their spawn?

2380
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:23,320
Come on.

2381
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:24,240
You got to see.

2382
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:24,980
I'm trying to play out!

2383
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,300
I'm shooting the shot, bro.

2384
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,800
Guys, please shoot the shot!

2385
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:28,180
No way.

2386
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:29,280
No way!

2387
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:30,160
Oh my god.

2388
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:30,720
Wait.

2389
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:33,020
Oh.

2390
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:34,180
I'm killing, I'm killing, I'm killing.

2391
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:34,800
Oh, wait.

2392
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:35,460
This is bad.

2393
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:36,660
I did not have my ult.

2394
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:37,600
Uh-oh.

2395
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:38,740
Oh no.

2396
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:39,540
Uh-oh.

2397
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:40,620
I can't get to you.

2398
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:41,460
I can't get to you.

2399
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:42,620
Do we have portal?

2400
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:43,180
I can!

2401
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:44,500
Do I have TP?

2402
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:46,740
I'm trying so hard to move.

2403
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:47,160
Okay.

2404
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:48,180
I don't think we have time, guys.

2405
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:48,660
I think we're good.

2406
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:50,060
No, I didn't think so.

2407
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:52,640
Wait, wait, wait.

2408
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:53,540
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2409
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:55,040
I can dash through.

2410
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:56,360
I can dash through.

2411
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:57,780
I dash through.

2412
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:01,180
Go through the back, go through the back.

2413
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:02,300
No!

2414
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:03,320
C-die!

2415
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:12,860
How do we lost the fight, because I kept shooting the venom, but I was the only one shooting the venom.

2416
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:14,860
But, I think we need to kill Jeff there though.

2417
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:15,080
Okay.

2418
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:16,920
There was a stranger behind us.

2419
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:18,040
I think we shot him in the back.

2420
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:18,880
Spawn is good, no?

2421
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,460
What was the plan behind the spawn camping there?

2422
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:26,260
You know, it was a group effort that we did.

2423
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:30,300
Wait, our Wolverine was in spawn?

2424
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:32,060
Yeah, he was spawn camping.

2425
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:35,480
We have Garmin agents in our game.

2426
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:36,620
Yeah, but holding what though?

2427
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:37,380
The TP.

2428
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:40,140
What are you holding there with TP, bro?

2429
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:41,740
When the TP went away and I got stuck there.

2430
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:43,080
Who exactly were you holding in your spawn?

2431
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:45,580
Holding the yellow.

2432
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,560
The voices, bro, the voices.

2433
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,940
The voices, what do they say, Moxie?

2434
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:54,580
Yeah, what do they say?

2435
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:56,320
I was holding an L, yeah.

2436
01:05:56,980 --> 01:05:58,260
Yeah, you were holding an L.

2437
01:05:58,460 --> 01:05:59,340
Yeah, that's life.

2438
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:01,140
That's life, damn right.

2439
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:02,100
So wise.

2440
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:04,540
Thank you.

2441
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:09,340
Honestly, for my first game back, I feel like I'm pretty confident.

2442
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:10,300
You did great.

2443
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:10,880
Yeah.

2444
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:13,600
I'm gonna try out the new Atom changes.

2445
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:14,560
Yeah.

2446
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:15,920
I wanna play Luna.

2447
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:17,000
Don't worry.

2448
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,440
I got the best skin for Luna to motivate us.

2449
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:19,920
Oh, fine, fine.

2450
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:21,320
Pull out the Loki.

2451
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:22,540
Pull out the Loki.

2452
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:22,640
Pull out the Loki.

2453
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:24,680
Or the Mantis, actually.

2454
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:25,420
You can go Mantis.

2455
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:26,320
For the team up.

2456
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:27,060
The Groot team up.

2457
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:31,480
Which one do you guys want?

2458
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:32,720
Do you guys want the Loki team up?

2459
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:33,340
For the...

2460
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:33,640
Oh, guys.

2461
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:34,340
Look at this.

2462
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:35,180
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

2463
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:37,220
Loki team has damage boost, too.

2464
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:38,920
Yeah.

2465
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,660
This is terrorism right here.

2466
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:40,980
Big lamps.

2467
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:43,460
Yeah, and the big ass lamps, too.

2468
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:43,740
Yeah.

2469
01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:46,260
We got a lot of damage.

2470
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:48,480
I think it's pretty stable.

2471
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:49,240
Wait.

2472
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:52,240
XTC can just plant the wall and you can just farm his ult.

2473
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:52,880
Oh, my God.

2474
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:53,160
What's that?

2475
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:53,600
Wait, hold on.

2476
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:55,940
Don't worry.

2477
01:06:56,660 --> 01:06:58,000
I'm playing DPS.

2478
01:06:58,600 --> 01:06:58,960
Okay.

2479
01:06:58,960 --> 01:06:59,840
Go Mantis, go Mantis.

2480
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:00,200
Me?

2481
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:00,440
Okay.

2482
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:01,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2483
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:02,580
We're just gonna farm.

2484
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:03,860
XTC, so...

2485
01:07:03,860 --> 01:07:04,320
Okay, okay.

2486
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:05,840
I think it should be pretty fast.

2487
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:06,860
Just double my FPS.

2488
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:08,120
All right.

2489
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:08,500
Oh, beautiful.

2490
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:09,160
Very good.

2491
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:09,580
Beautiful.

2492
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:11,400
I'm ready.

2493
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:13,060
I think I was playing on 60 frames, guys.

2494
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:13,760
But it's okay now.

2495
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:15,900
I'm playing on 500 frames.

2496
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:16,420
Full potential unlocked.

2497
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:18,400
Three, two, one.

2498
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:19,280
All right.

2499
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:20,820
I'll give Moxie the...

2500
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:21,120
Oh.

2501
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:22,260
Oh.

2502
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:23,480
Really?

2503
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:24,440
Really?

2504
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:25,200
What year is this?

2505
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:25,780
What year is this?

2506
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:26,980
The mic even shut out.

2507
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,480
It had to happen to one person.

2508
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:29,880
The mic even shut out.

2509
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:30,500
The mic even shut out.

2510
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:31,980
No, I expected more from you, FanFans.

2511
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:32,280
Yeah.

2512
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:32,980
There's someone up here.

2513
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:33,640
There's someone up here.

2514
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:34,960
I'm disappointed there, I'll be honest.

2515
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:36,820
Does it say...

2516
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:37,780
Only play Venom?

2517
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:38,560
Someone in the back, someone in the back!

2518
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:39,440
Yeah, it's Andrew.

2519
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:39,900
Guys.

2520
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:42,720
It's number one EU Venom.

2521
01:07:43,580 --> 01:07:44,820
Andrew's playing Strange right now.

2522
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:46,180
Guys, I need a little bit of assistance.

2523
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:47,140
I'm reduced healing.

2524
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:48,180
They're cooking me.

2525
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:49,100
Guys, they're gonna cut off here.

2526
01:07:49,180 --> 01:07:49,880
We can kill them right here.

2527
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:51,060
There is a blade.

2528
01:07:51,060 --> 01:07:51,640
I'm shooting the Strange.

2529
01:07:51,740 --> 01:07:52,680
Strange sandwich, you guys.

2530
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:53,940
I'm putting the wrong buttons completely.

2531
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:55,380
Oh, I have a healing wall kinda cool.

2532
01:07:56,020 --> 01:07:57,480
There's a Strange right behind us.

2533
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:58,760
There is a blade up.

2534
01:07:58,980 --> 01:07:59,540
Oh, there is a.

2535
01:07:59,700 --> 01:07:59,940
Not a blade.

2536
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:00,720
Kill one of his blind.

2537
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:01,220
Kill one of his blind.

2538
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:01,280
Kill one of his blind.

2539
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:03,120
You got him, bro.

2540
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:04,200
You got this.

2541
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,040
I really don't got him.

2542
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:05,940
Guys, you can kill the VP.

2543
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:06,360
Come on.

2544
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:06,680
I got him.

2545
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:07,420
Nice.

2546
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:08,360
Let's get him, guys.

2547
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:09,860
Let's go.

2548
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:11,280
Unit.

2549
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:11,640
Unit.

2550
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:11,880
Unit.

2551
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:14,360
I'm going into Luna.

2552
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:15,840
I'm here.

2553
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:17,160
I'm so scared.

2554
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:18,680
Don't be scared.

2555
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:19,640
Okay.

2556
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:20,220
Just believe.

2557
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:21,920
I'm getting quick, guys.

2558
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:22,700
I'm getting quick.

2559
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:23,600
I'm more close.

2560
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:25,700
You are so far up.

2561
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:28,400
How is she not the grenade agent?

2562
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:29,960
Oh, I'm trying.

2563
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:30,220
Dang.

2564
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:32,460
I did the link and everything, too.

2565
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:33,820
What?

2566
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,360
Guys, this is a quick play game.

2567
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:40,220
I want to point out this is a quick play.

2568
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:41,280
Explain!

2569
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:43,960
We're doing great, guys.

2570
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:45,180
I believe in us.

2571
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:45,940
Guys, we got this.

2572
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:46,380
We got this.

2573
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:47,500
Okay, watch this.

2574
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:48,020
We're here.

2575
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:49,940
We're all together now.

2576
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:51,620
I have no idea what the hell I'm doing right now.

2577
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:52,740
Okay, I got you.

2578
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:54,640
I got Snowflake on you.

2579
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:56,400
Wait, Booger's twirling.

2580
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:56,760
Where is there Luna?

2581
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:57,860
Where is there Luna?

2582
01:08:58,120 --> 01:08:58,700
Everything's fine.

2583
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:00,380
Okay, guys.

2584
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:00,780
I'm ready.

2585
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:02,900
I'm gonna TP high ground.

2586
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:03,800
I know where the Luna is.

2587
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:04,700
So, um...

2588
01:09:05,860 --> 01:09:06,500
Worse bit.

2589
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:08,320
You wanna clear above?

2590
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:08,920
You wanna clear above?

2591
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:09,360
You wanna clear above?

2592
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:10,120
Where?

2593
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:10,380
Boom.

2594
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:13,480
Oh, my God.

2595
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:14,240
Would you be okay?

2596
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:14,780
We got him.

2597
01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:15,000
We got him.

2598
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:15,160
We got him.

2599
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:15,820
Please.

2600
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:17,920
Where's my team?

2601
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:18,400
Me!

2602
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:19,060
I got you, Tin.

2603
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:19,740
I got you, Tin.

2604
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:20,300
I mean, we TPed.

2605
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:22,140
Guys, I'm teleporting around the map.

2606
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:23,600
Oh, my God.

2607
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:24,680
Are you guys so nice?

2608
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:25,940
What is the guy doing?

2609
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:27,760
Wax, I'm ready for the combo.

2610
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:28,480
I'm ready for the combo.

2611
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:31,160
I don't know what's going on.

2612
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:31,520
I don't know what's going on.

2613
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:32,140
Oh, you already did it.

2614
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:35,440
Oh, I ulted, but like...

2615
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:39,020
I have a black panther on me.

2616
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:41,780
It's okay, we have res.

2617
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:44,160
Oh, huge res.

2618
01:09:44,540 --> 01:09:45,260
Huge res.

2619
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:45,620
Huge res, huge res.

Oh, wait, me and me.

2626
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:53,680
Oh.

2629
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:55,880

I got it.

2634
01:09:58,780 --> 01:09:59,960
I'm so dead, though.

2635
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:01,840
Do you want blade?

2636
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:04,380
I'm just like Adam right now.

2637
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:06,560
We're still alive, it's okay.

2638
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:06,940
We're still alive, it's okay.

2639
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:07,540
I don't know what I'm...

2640
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:10,440
No, you believe in yourself, Moxie.

Maybe I'll just give the- There's a BP up top.

2651
01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:26,540
He's going in.

2652
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:27,300
Yeah, he's going up.

2653
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:28,040
I froze him.

2654
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:28,320
I froze him.

2655
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:28,460
I froze him.

2656
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:29,740
Nice grab.

2657
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:32,420
We got this.

2658
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,260
I hit that big one, big one.

2659
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:35,880

01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,120
Wow, we have a huge...

Oh, caught him, caught him.

01:10:47,380 --> 01:10:48,140
Get a Groot, get a Groot.

2668
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:49,280
Groot cut!

2669
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:49,860
They're going to tep!

2672
01:10:53,220 --> 01:10:55,240
Who's going to cancel the tep?

2673
01:10:56,540 --> 01:10:57,380
Who's going to cancel it?

2674
01:10:57,540 --> 01:10:57,900
Nobody!

2675
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,060
There's a blade behind us!

2676
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:01,920
Barger.

2677
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,580
I believe in that 1v1.

2678
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,400
I can just spawn myself in front of them!

2679
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:07,680
You got to get your eyes off!

2680
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:08,460
Okay, that's true!

2681
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:11,140
Wait, there is TP!

2682
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:24,240
I'm with you, booger.

2683
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:27,580
Can you heal me up?

2684
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:28,900
Yeah, of course.

2685
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:29,920
Thank you.

2686
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:30,180
Thank you.

2687
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:30,400
Thank you.

01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:30,720
Thank you.

2690
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:31,700
Absolutely.

2691
01:11:32,140 --> 01:11:32,940
I got a group.

2692
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:33,400
Nice.

2693
01:11:33,980 --> 01:11:34,660
You're so linked.

2694
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:35,520
Never die.

2695
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:35,900
Beautiful.

2696
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:37,240
I'm cutting him out.

2697
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:40,140
You said that when you weren't even here.

2698
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:44,220
Ohhhh.

2699
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:44,720
Don't worry.

2700
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:45,000
Don't worry.

2701
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:45,520
I got this.

2702
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:47,100
Do you have rest?

2703
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:48,500
Oh, he does.

2704
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:48,800
He does.

2705
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:49,920
I have ult too, right after.

2706
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:51,080
Oh, they used everything.

2707
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:52,820
Fort again!

2708
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:53,860

2709
01:11:53,860 --> 01:11:54,040
Oh man.

2710
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:56,700
We all live.

2711
01:11:56,860 --> 01:11:57,240
We all live.

2712
01:11:58,860 --> 01:11:59,220
Okay.

2713
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:00,500
You're all out.

2714
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:01,040
Hell they got.

2715
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:02,660
Oh.

2716
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:03,980
I'm ready.

2717
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:05,660
That's you.

2718
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:06,420
That's you.

2719
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:07,920
I got you booger.

2720
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:09,560
Get this guy.

2721
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:09,940
This guy.

2722
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:11,980
A point, a point.

2723
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:12,820
Train to the back.

2724
01:12:12,820 --> 01:12:13,920
Train to the back.

2725
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:15,120
Train to the back.

2726
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:16,660
This guy is the stall master.

2727
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:18,160
Nice.

2728
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:20,740
You guys go back a little bit.

2729
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:21,160
I go up.

2730
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:22,560
I'm gonna walk them out.

2731
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:24,600
I got combo with you too.

2732
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:25,260
Yes, no flake.

2733
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:27,580
X, I got combo.

2734
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:28,580
Let me know when you're looking.

2735
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:32,880
And in mind, they can wall me off if you do it.

2736
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:35,680
But I'm like, I'll be ready.

2737
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:36,640
Groot's on the right.

2738
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:37,240
Groot's on the right.

2739
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:39,000
Don't worry, I'm mind controlling him right now.

2740
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:41,040
He's won, he's won.

2741
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:45,780
Was he just focused on you?

2742
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:46,700
Yeah.

2743
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:48,760
Nice mind control.

2744
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:50,220
I think he's over here somewhere.

2745
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,280
I could've healed you there.

2746
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:52,760
That's not me.

2747
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:55,200
Oh my god.

2748
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,680
That's unfortunate.

2749
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:58,800
But he is one.

2750
01:12:59,120 --> 01:12:59,760
Oh, he's getting healed.

2751
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:02,940
I'm dead.

2752
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:04,560
There's a passenger behind.

2753
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:09,020
I'm dead.

2754
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:13,620
I'm dead.

2755
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:13,880
I'm dead.

2756
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:14,340
I'm dead.

2757
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:15,600
I'm dead.

2758
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:16,700
Wait, wait, wait.

2759
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:18,840
Wait, are we still playing?

2760
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:19,940
Wait, I died.

2761
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:20,920
I got this.

2762
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:21,240
I got this.

2763
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:22,200
I got my one.

2764
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:26,720
Oh, we actually are on quick play?

2765
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:26,920
Yeah.

2766
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:30,840
I thought you were unironically.

2767
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:37,190
This feels like a quick play team.

2768
01:13:38,390 --> 01:13:39,690
What is happening back there?

2769
01:13:39,730 --> 01:13:42,650
Let me fix my key binds, guys.

2770
01:13:42,770 --> 01:13:43,030
I got this.

2771
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:44,490
I got you, Maxi.

2772
01:13:44,490 --> 01:13:44,990
Yes, nothing.

2773
01:13:45,530 --> 01:13:46,870
No, my heal didn't go up.

2774
01:13:48,350 --> 01:13:49,150
You're so healthy.

2775
01:13:50,370 --> 01:13:51,170
Oh, okay.

2776
01:13:51,310 --> 01:13:51,670
We win this.

2777
01:13:51,790 --> 01:13:52,510
I full bugged myself.

2778
01:13:52,570 --> 01:13:53,010
That was crazy.

2779
01:13:53,450 --> 01:13:54,310
I don't see you.

2780
01:13:54,650 --> 01:13:56,510
No, there was a...

2781
01:14:00,190 --> 01:14:00,990
I'm sorry.

2782
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:02,250
There was nothing I could do.

2783
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:02,410
I can't do it.

2784
01:14:04,110 --> 01:14:05,370
I can't do it.

2785
01:14:06,430 --> 01:14:09,090
Is this Kenny person like a fucking one-trick guy on the ground of Jeff?

2786
01:14:09,290 --> 01:14:09,450
I'm kidding.

2787
01:14:09,450 --> 01:14:09,790
I'm just crazy.

2788
01:14:10,110 --> 01:14:10,210
I'm kidding.

2789
01:14:10,390 --> 01:14:10,810
Jeff down.

2790
01:14:12,590 --> 01:14:13,430
Jeff's a problem.

2791
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:14,150
Yeah.

2792
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:16,010
Well, they're dead right now.

2793
01:14:16,850 --> 01:14:17,230
I'm dead.

2794
01:14:17,790 --> 01:14:18,090
You're okay.

2795
01:14:18,170 --> 01:14:18,430
You're okay.

2796
01:14:18,770 --> 01:14:18,950
You're okay.

2797
01:14:19,070 --> 01:14:19,290
You're okay.

2798
01:14:19,450 --> 01:14:19,630
They're ATP 'ing, guys.

2799
01:14:19,730 --> 01:14:20,170
They're ATP'ing.

2800
01:14:22,090 --> 01:14:22,950
I need HP.

2801
01:14:23,270 --> 01:14:23,630
I need HP.

2802
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:23,970
It's fine.

2803
01:14:24,370 --> 01:14:24,950
We're so healthy.

2804
01:14:25,570 --> 01:14:26,230
I have love.

2805
01:14:26,230 --> 01:14:26,490
Oh, no, no.

2806
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:26,890
I'm running.

2807
01:14:29,070 --> 01:14:30,590
They're TP'd, but I don't know why.

2808
01:14:30,770 --> 01:14:31,410
They got it.

2809
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:32,050
They're gonna get out of me.

2810
01:14:32,950 --> 01:14:33,570
You're fine.

2811
01:14:34,630 --> 01:14:34,850
Beautiful.

2812
01:14:36,490 --> 01:14:37,070
X, I'm ready.

2813
01:14:37,190 --> 01:14:37,370
I'm ready.

2814
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:37,950
Alright.

2815
01:14:39,050 --> 01:14:39,930
We do this.

2816
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:41,590
X, I'm ready.

2817
01:14:41,670 --> 01:14:42,150
Vinny, Vinny.

2818
01:14:42,530 --> 01:14:42,830
Yup.

2819
01:14:44,050 --> 01:14:44,730
You got one.

2820
01:14:45,430 --> 01:14:45,910
There's two.

2821
01:14:45,910 --> 01:14:47,010
There's two in there and these.

2822
01:14:48,130 --> 01:14:49,110
It's all of them.

2823
01:14:49,410 --> 01:14:50,250
Yeah, yeah, there's all of them.

2824
01:14:51,030 --> 01:14:51,750
It's all of them.

2825
01:14:52,090 --> 01:14:52,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2826
01:14:53,670 --> 01:14:55,310
I saw like seven people in there.

2827
01:14:56,910 --> 01:14:57,970
Ooh, first kill, boys.

2828
01:14:58,570 --> 01:14:59,170
All my friends, guys.

2829
01:15:01,210 --> 01:15:02,030
Supports are on cart.

2830
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:03,250
So if you guys need keys...

2831
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:04,070
Oh, I'm just going to get a big one, guys.

2832
01:15:04,170 --> 01:15:04,890
Get ready for this one.

2833
01:15:06,970 --> 01:15:07,930
Oh, God, I can't reach you.

2834
01:15:08,290 --> 01:15:09,750
No, my heals was going to the...

2835
01:15:12,650 --> 01:15:13,450
Don't worry, I'm just passing.

2836
01:15:13,450 --> 01:15:15,070
Yeah, come back, come back, come back, come back.

2837
01:15:15,070 --> 01:15:19,230
Okay, we are so...

2838
01:15:19,230 --> 01:15:20,130
Oh, I just accidentally dashed.

2839
01:15:20,190 --> 01:15:21,010
Uh-oh.

2840
01:15:21,910 --> 01:15:23,890
That's it, that's it, back up, back up, back up.

2841
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:24,830
Oh, Baki.

2842
01:15:29,270 --> 01:15:29,970
I think he is.

2843
01:15:29,970 --> 01:15:30,590
Got you, got you.

2844
01:15:33,270 --> 01:15:34,290
He's alone in every way.

2845
01:15:34,670 --> 01:15:35,350
He's going to stuck out.

2846
01:15:36,830 --> 01:15:38,150
He dashed up before I could dink.

2847
01:15:40,210 --> 01:15:41,130
There's a BP up top.

2848
01:15:41,150 --> 01:15:41,950
Oh, wait, wait, he fucked up.

2849
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:42,630
Let's go, let's go.

2850
01:15:43,290 --> 01:15:43,810
He tripped.

2851
01:15:43,810 --> 01:15:45,090
We got him, we're done.

2852
01:15:45,210 --> 01:15:45,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2853
01:15:45,850 --> 01:15:46,470
He tripped and fell.

2854
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:49,810
BP to the back.

2855
01:15:50,010 --> 01:15:50,810
Yeah, I'm dead here.

2856
01:15:51,370 --> 01:15:51,770
We got to triple.

2857
01:15:52,230 --> 01:15:54,510
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2858
01:15:54,670 --> 01:15:55,250
I have a BP up.

2859
01:15:55,590 --> 01:15:55,910
It's fine.

2860
01:15:55,910 --> 01:15:56,190
Everything's fine.

2861
01:15:56,470 --> 01:15:56,950
Everything's fine.

2862
01:15:58,090 --> 01:15:58,730
Trip on.

2863
01:15:59,190 --> 01:15:59,750
Born again.

2864
01:16:00,410 --> 01:16:00,510
Oh!

2865
01:16:00,830 --> 01:16:01,890
Oh, we have a man as well.

2866
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:02,430
He's ready.

2867
01:16:02,990 --> 01:16:03,670
Where am I?

2868
01:16:04,190 --> 01:16:04,970
He's won, he's won.

2869
01:16:07,790 --> 01:16:08,710
Oh, Black Panther's one.

2870
01:16:08,810 --> 01:16:09,290
Got him, got him.

2871
01:16:10,270 --> 01:16:11,390
Oh, my God, he got him.

2872
01:16:12,550 --> 01:16:12,870
Help!

2873
01:16:13,990 --> 01:16:16,430
We're fine, we're fine, we're so fine, we're so fine.

2874
01:16:16,490 --> 01:16:17,210
I'm here, right here.

2875
01:16:17,610 --> 01:16:18,290
Get the rat!

2876
01:16:18,850 --> 01:16:19,110
Get the rat!

2877
01:16:19,130 --> 01:16:19,510
Get the rat!

2878
01:16:20,150 --> 01:16:21,570
The rat is just swimming away!

2879
01:16:21,570 --> 01:16:22,090
He's won, he's won!

2880
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:24,110
Get him, get him, Max, get him!

2881
01:16:24,190 --> 01:16:25,010
I'm out, I can't do it!

2882
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:25,930
No, I'm not chasing him, bro.

2883
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:26,750
I'm pushing in.

2884
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:29,630
Jeff just behind.

2885
01:16:30,270 --> 01:16:30,770
That's fine.

2886
01:16:30,990 --> 01:16:31,730
Guys, there's a BP here.

2887
01:16:32,330 --> 01:16:33,210
It's so fine.

2888
01:16:33,450 --> 01:16:33,710
Winnable.

2889
01:16:34,410 --> 01:16:36,210
I believe...

2890
01:16:36,210 --> 01:16:37,190
Oh, never mind.

2891
01:16:40,150 --> 01:16:41,990
Oh, I don't know if you lived that.

2892
01:16:41,990 --> 01:16:45,030
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

2893
01:16:45,370 --> 01:16:46,470
Careful, careful for the healing!

2894
01:16:47,210 --> 01:16:48,570
Oh no, he's last fight!

2895
01:16:50,950 --> 01:16:51,390
Oh!

2896
01:16:52,470 --> 01:16:53,470
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

2897
01:16:53,710 --> 01:16:54,570
FTP, FTP, FTP, wait, wait, wait.

2898
01:16:55,390 --> 01:16:55,990
Listen, listen, listen.

2899
01:16:56,170 --> 01:16:57,150
I have to be, I'm swapping.

2900
01:16:58,950 --> 01:17:01,330
Okay, Sure4 is like on a mission right now.

2901
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:03,330
We got this, we got this.

2902
01:17:07,370 --> 01:17:08,210
I'm opening a portal.

2903
01:17:09,770 --> 01:17:10,210
Okay.

2904
01:17:14,490 --> 01:17:16,950
I got both DPS.

2905
01:17:17,110 --> 01:17:18,170
I can board again though.

2906
01:17:19,350 --> 01:17:20,670
Behind you, there's a brain!

2907
01:17:21,010 --> 01:17:22,090
I don't know what's up here.

2908
01:17:23,470 --> 01:17:23,850
Oh my god.

2909
01:17:24,130 --> 01:17:25,170
Oh, there's...

2910
01:17:25,170 --> 01:17:26,170
Oh, there was a platform!

2911
01:17:26,770 --> 01:17:27,130
I died.

2912
01:17:27,570 --> 01:17:28,930
Oh, oh.

2913
01:17:29,150 --> 01:17:29,610
I'm getting even.

2914
01:17:29,790 --> 01:17:30,430
Oh, oh.

2915
01:17:30,430 --> 01:17:31,150
Again, man.

2916
01:17:31,670 --> 01:17:33,290
Oh my god, bruh.

2917
01:17:35,130 --> 01:17:36,910
It's okay, you got board again again, right?

2918
01:17:36,910 --> 01:17:37,890
That was so close.

2919
01:17:37,890 --> 01:17:38,510
I got another portal.

2920
01:17:38,690 --> 01:17:39,190
I got another portal.

2921
01:17:39,890 --> 01:17:40,410
I got another portal.

2922
01:17:40,810 --> 01:17:41,230
I got another portal.

2923
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:42,710
Yeah, yeah, portal again.

2924
01:17:46,190 --> 01:17:47,210
Oh my god, the shark.

2925
01:17:47,210 --> 01:17:47,430
That's pretty close.

2926
01:17:48,650 --> 01:17:49,950
Stupid rat shark.

2927
01:17:51,210 --> 01:17:52,870
I think if we have the defense there, we win.

2928
01:17:53,010 --> 01:17:53,470
First point hold.

2929
01:17:54,070 --> 01:18:06,590
I think we had a...

2930
01:18:07,710 --> 01:18:08,370
They're...

2931
01:18:09,490 --> 01:18:10,150
They're...

2932
01:18:10,150 --> 01:18:11,010
...bladed in SVP.

2933
01:18:11,650 --> 01:18:12,550
One of them left.

2934
01:18:13,150 --> 01:18:13,730
They left?

2935
01:18:13,730 --> 01:18:13,930
Oh.

2936
01:18:14,550 --> 01:18:14,990
Yeah.

2937
01:18:15,290 --> 01:18:16,090
Probably scared.

2938
01:18:16,470 --> 01:18:16,950
They just GG says.

2939
01:18:16,990 --> 01:18:17,790
They're scared of getting mugged.

2940
01:18:20,550 --> 01:18:21,930
They're like, that's enough practice.

2941
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:33,440
It's so chaotic.

2942
01:18:34,620 --> 01:18:35,540
Wait, two of them left.

2943
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:38,400
Anyway, fan fan, do you play RP?

2944
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:41,060
Nope, I haven't in like two...

2945
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:42,200
A year and a half, maybe.

2946
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:42,940
Oh yeah, same.

2947
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,080
What does an XTC ask me questions?

2948
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:46,000
Yeah.

2949
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:48,600
Because I know you more than I know her.

2950
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:49,480
Okay.

2951
01:18:49,860 --> 01:18:49,980
Yeah.

2952
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:52,160
We did play together a lot.

2953
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:54,840
Yeah, unfortunately.

2954
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:58,380
What do you mean by that?

2955
01:18:58,820 --> 01:19:00,460
You got beef with the XTC?

2956
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:02,220
I've been saying in a long time, to be fair.

2957
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:05,520
No, I'm just saying, I'm just saying, as a player, you're a load, you know?

2958
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:07,300
I'm just like, everything seems so fast.

2959
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,240
I'm playing like very slow games.

2960
01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:11,320
Can you define what a load means?

2961
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:12,660
Everything was like, I'm like, oh my gosh.

2962
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:15,280
Can you readjust how fast everything is?

2963
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:16,040
Listen, what do you mean by these are loads?

2964
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:18,020
I'm saying, if your team has six surfboards, you're going nowhere.

2965
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:22,200
No, they're winning grand finals, a hundred percent.

2966
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:27,540
If your team has six XQCs, they wouldn't be playing the game.

2967
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:29,460
Yeah, yeah, we wouldn't even get through the lobby.

2968
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:31,980
And I know that for a fact, though.

2969
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:35,760
It's not a bad thing, but a little bit of surfboard I can handle.

2970
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:37,920
It's just a little bit.

2971
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:38,620
It's just a little bit.

2972
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:40,960
But too many in this, a little bit too big a load.

2973
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:42,360
Dude, too much, I can't.

2974
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:44,740
What's the maximum amount of surfboards you can handle?

2975
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:50,440
God, listen, one lobby of surfboards I can do a day.

2976
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:51,720
Two hours of scrims.

2977
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:52,880
Lag.

2978
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:53,420
Sorry.

2979
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:56,880
Lag.

2980
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:57,700
Lag.

2981
01:19:58,020 --> 01:19:58,460
Lag.

2982
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:07,260
30 seconds before you attack, get ready.

2983
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:08,920
Boger on Hella?

2984
01:20:10,340 --> 01:20:16,020
I'm just showcasing the new skin that's coming out with season 3.5.

2985
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:17,060
Wow.

2986
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:18,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2987
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:19,100
Look at this.

2988
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:19,640
Look at this, guys.

2989
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:20,300
Look at this skin.

2990
01:20:20,420 --> 01:20:20,880
Isn't it beautiful?

2991
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:24,540
Yeah, and you can buy it on August 8th.

2992
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:26,080
August 8th, I'm right.

2993
01:20:26,180 --> 01:20:28,280
Yeah, with the premium pass, guys.

2994
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:31,220
There will be 990 coins.

2995
01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:32,260
It's looking cool.

2996
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:33,760
That is neat.

2997
01:20:35,940 --> 01:20:36,420
Wait,

2998
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:40,760
guys, can you come to spawn real quick?

2999
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:41,840
Oh, yeah, I got you.

3000
01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:43,280
Most of them are bad.

3001
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:43,400
Yeah?

3002
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:44,320
Oh.

3003
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:44,920
Oh.

3004
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:46,860
Wait, that's an actual e-vote?

3005
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:48,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, they did.

3006
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:50,520
Oh, I don't want to see anyone.

3007
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:52,360
I didn't realize that was...

3008
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:53,700
I thought it was just fan art.

3009
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,260
I'm everywhere.

3010
01:20:58,600 --> 01:20:58,760
Okay.

3011
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:00,340
Above us, there's a guy.

3012
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:03,260
Wait, they have born again now.

3013
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:04,640
Is there a turn?

3014
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:05,480
Born again?

3015
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:06,540
Yo, I'm main.

3016
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:07,420
We can kill the old man right here.

3017
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:08,380
I'm shooting out.

3018
01:21:08,620 --> 01:21:09,240
Clapping, clapping.

3019
01:21:11,220 --> 01:21:12,340
We got a beautiful.

3020
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:13,340
Can we get the blade here?

3021
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:16,340
I used two laps accidentally.

3022
01:21:17,180 --> 01:21:17,600
That's okay.

3023
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:18,140
I'm on the blade.

3024
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:18,680
He's one.

3025
01:21:18,780 --> 01:21:19,020
Beautiful.

3026
01:21:19,460 --> 01:21:20,200
The rat, the rat.

3027
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,240
Can we get the rat?

3028
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:24,460
There's a torch that's just dying, by the way.

3029
01:21:24,460 --> 01:21:25,240
He's like one.

3030
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:26,460
He's the back guy like, oh my god.

3031
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:28,060
Hey, there's a born again right in front of us.

3032
01:21:28,180 --> 01:21:29,920
And I think he's gonna born again here.

3033
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:31,120
He said, oh no.

3034
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:32,180
No, no.

3035
01:21:32,180 --> 01:21:32,340
Nazi Nazi.

3036
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:33,400
No, no, no.

3037
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:33,840
No, no, no.

3038
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:35,900
Oh, yep, yep, yep, yep.

3039
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:36,120
Come back.

3040
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:36,940
He's anti-healed.

3041
01:21:37,740 --> 01:21:38,900
Um, what are you doing here?

3042
01:21:39,580 --> 01:21:40,520
Wait, what are you doing here?

3043
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:40,880
What are you doing?

3044
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:41,300
I'm like stealing.

3045
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:42,420
Aha, beautiful.

3046
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:43,280
I'm dead.

3047
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:44,100
I have to reload.

3048
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:44,660
I'm sorry.

3049
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:45,400
BLEH!

3050
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:48,760
Wait, Jeff is one.

3051
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:49,400
Fucking rat on point.

3052
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:50,040
I got him.

3053
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:50,260
I got him.

3054
01:21:50,380 --> 01:21:50,600
I got him.

3055
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:51,940
I had to reload though.

3056
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:54,800
Yo, these are totals.

3057
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:57,740
They're like optimized like new age tiktok potals or something like what?

3058
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:58,380
Like, what is that?

3059
01:21:59,580 --> 01:22:01,680
It's assault heart without going through the portal.

3060
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:03,140
I mean, that's crazy.

3061
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:04,800
He went on the other side.

3062
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:06,820
The other side.

3063
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:08,960
Tiktok potals in a custom lobby.

3064
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:09,880
It's crazy.

3065
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:14,640
Listen, I lagged out.

3066
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:15,320
No healing.

3067
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:15,900
No space.

3068
01:22:16,460 --> 01:22:16,980
No DPS.

3069
01:22:17,260 --> 01:22:17,600
Dive shit.

3070
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:18,340
But you're the Hulk.

3071
01:22:18,340 --> 01:22:19,160
You're the one making...

3072
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:19,680
Yeah, you're the one making...

3073
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:20,360
Dive shit.

3074
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:21,760
I grade space and what he like...

3075
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:22,360
Oh, if I'm...

3076
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:22,880
You get an old space.

3077
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:24,820
I was running from spawn after I died.

3078
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:26,020
A classic...

3079
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:27,160
I'm bad, I'm bad, I'm bad, I'm bad, I'm bad.

3080
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:32,480
I was about to be able to do that with you, but then I died.

3081
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:32,880
I got him.

3082
01:22:33,020 --> 01:22:33,240
Cook him.

3083
01:22:33,260 --> 01:22:33,600
Cook him.

3084
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:33,780
Cook him.

3085
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:33,880
Cook him.

3086
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:36,320
Is that the whole reason you went Hulk?

3087
01:22:37,980 --> 01:22:38,680
I'm not moving.

3088
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:41,080
I forgot to do the confirmed thing.

3089
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:43,580
This guy went Hulk using solo ult Necros.

3090
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:46,040
I rolled him.

3091
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:46,320
Rolled him.

3092
01:22:46,340 --> 01:22:47,080
I rolled him.

3093
01:22:47,740 --> 01:22:48,540
Oh, don't worry.

3094
01:22:48,620 --> 01:22:49,040
I'm dancing.

3095
01:22:49,620 --> 01:22:50,280
Got his ass.

3096
01:22:50,580 --> 01:22:50,660
We're five.

3097
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:51,460
Don't worry.

3098
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:53,780
Where's your rat now?

3099
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:54,720
Where's your rat now?

3100
01:22:54,940 --> 01:22:56,140
Oh wait, he has board again.

3101
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:57,520
Oh, in, in, in, in.

3102
01:22:57,660 --> 01:22:57,920
Oh, shit.

3103
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:00,400
Oh, we're not in there.

3104
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:02,120
Oh, I am.

3105
01:23:02,260 --> 01:23:02,740
What the hell?

3106
01:23:03,140 --> 01:23:03,700
I am strange.

3107
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:06,560
Are you okay?

3108
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:07,260
You are strange?

3109
01:23:07,460 --> 01:23:08,120
Are you having good times?

3110
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:09,220
Wait, we're kissing.

3111
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:12,420
We're in a very beautiful embrace.

3112
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:12,880
Nice.

3113
01:23:13,580 --> 01:23:15,500
Did he only rest one person?

3114
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:16,280
I think so.

3115
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:16,720
I think so.

3116
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:18,140
He was.

3117
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:18,420
Yeah.

3118
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:20,260
Oh my god, this chain is forever.

3119
01:23:23,660 --> 01:23:26,140
There's no way this guy went Wolverine because I bullied him.

3120
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:28,940
He's had enough.

3121
01:23:29,820 --> 01:23:31,120
He's had enough with what your shit.

3122
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:38,500
Don't worry, I'm making Venn diagram.

3123
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:38,880
Thank you.

3124
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:39,660
Well, that was very well done.

3125
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:40,140
I didn't have a good day.

3126
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:40,660
Bag lamp.

3127
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:43,880
Okay, I can't do anything about that though.

3128
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:44,360
I might be cooked.

3129
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:46,020
I can't do it.

3130
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:47,200
I got a thousand gaunted.

3131
01:23:47,580 --> 01:23:48,860
I feel like I was blocking.

3132
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:49,180
Yeah.

3133
01:23:49,620 --> 01:23:50,460
Where's the short four?

3134
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:51,480
I think it's on me at the start.

3135
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:52,980
You're all alive thingy.

3136
01:23:53,220 --> 01:23:54,100
Where's our combo?

3137
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:54,920
He's chasing me.

3138
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:55,780
Different hero.

3139
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:56,300
Different hero.

3140
01:23:56,660 --> 01:23:57,000
He's chasing me.

3141
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:57,840
Why didn't the short four do that?

3142
01:23:57,960 --> 01:23:59,040
What that guy just did.

3143
01:23:59,360 --> 01:23:59,600
Yeah.

3144
01:23:59,940 --> 01:24:00,580
Why didn't we have...

3145
01:24:00,580 --> 01:24:02,560
Why does the Loki have MVP?

3146
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:03,740
There's a terrorist on me.

3147
01:24:03,780 --> 01:24:04,580
There's a terrorist on me.

3148
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:05,180
He's chasing me.

3149
01:24:05,300 --> 01:24:05,480
Please.

3150
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:08,560
Their blade has MVP.

3151
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:09,980
Wolverine.

3152
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:10,960
Wolverine.

3153
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:12,700
Wolverine on me, guys.

3154
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:13,720
He's chasing me.

3155
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,060
Guys, I'm creating space.

3156
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:16,060
I'm creating space.

3157
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:16,980
Please push up.

3158
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:18,200
One for one.

3159
01:24:18,620 --> 01:24:19,540
So Wolverine's on him.

3160
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:21,260
Who's on him again?

3161
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,080
I think the Wolverine.

3162
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:23,520
Flats!

3163
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:25,900
No, not Flats, Wolverine.

3164
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:27,080
No, not Flats.

3165
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:27,440
Fuck it.

3166
01:24:28,420 --> 01:24:28,860
Guys, help me.

3167
01:24:29,660 --> 01:24:30,600
Is it big?

3168
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:30,980
What are you...

3169
01:24:30,980 --> 01:24:31,840
It's not long, guys.

3170
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:32,180
No, we need it.

3171
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:32,820
We need it.

3172
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:33,680
Get in the...

3173
01:24:35,220 --> 01:24:35,960
I'm trying to...

3174
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:36,320
Get in the lab!

3175
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:37,040
Get in the lab!

3176
01:24:37,220 --> 01:24:37,940
He's a wolf over there.

3177
01:24:38,260 --> 01:24:38,760
I need helping.

3178
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:39,360
I need helping.

3179
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:40,640
Inside of us.

3180
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:41,140
Okay.

3181
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:42,360
Okay.

3182
01:24:42,540 --> 01:24:42,920
Are you...

3183
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:43,720
Are you guys...

3184
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:44,980
Do you guys still need help?

3185
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:46,060
Do you guys...

3186
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:49,220
Wait, I have my ult.

3187
01:24:49,340 --> 01:24:49,600
I have my ult.

3188
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:50,300
Nice.

3189
01:24:50,860 --> 01:24:51,180
Four.

3190
01:24:51,540 --> 01:24:51,860
Three!

3191
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:52,440
Yeah, yeah.

3192
01:24:52,580 --> 01:24:52,660
We're in.

3193
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:53,260
Hoping's level.

3194
01:24:53,660 --> 01:24:54,280
Oh, I know.

3195
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:54,800
Squirrel, go.

3196
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:58,140
Squirrel stampede.

3197
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:01,840
Why is no one shooting the squirrels?

3198
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:02,760
I don't know.

3199
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:03,760
I have ult, I have ult, I have ult.

3200
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:05,980
I'm holding it a little feeling.

3201
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:06,980
I'm healing, I'm healing.

3202
01:25:06,980 --> 01:25:07,340
I'm healing you.

3203
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:09,960
I don't have to heal anymore.

3204
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:13,360
I have ult on points.

3205
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:14,180
Oh, they're getting cutted.

3206
01:25:17,620 --> 01:25:18,600
Is everybody okay?

3207
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:19,540
I can't tell.

3208
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:20,260
I'm chilling.

3209
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:20,720
How are you?

3210
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:21,720
Everything's going great.

3211
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:23,080
I am not okay.

3212
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:24,740
This fight has been forever.

3213
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:26,880
That looks great.

3214
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:27,940
Oh my god, we made it.

3215
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:29,180
Just like Scrooge.

3216
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:30,920
Hey, that took all my juice, by the way.

3217
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:32,720
That was a long fight.

3218
01:25:33,020 --> 01:25:34,160
You're juiceless for the rest of the game.

3219
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:34,720
We gotta carry.

3220
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,440
Yeah, I mean, that was crazy.

3221
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:38,400
I'm not washed.

3222
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:38,900
I locked in.

3223
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:40,340
Hey, let's go.

3224
01:25:42,020 --> 01:25:43,220
That's the rank one Groot.

3225
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:43,620
Look at that.

3226
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:44,400
Look at that.

3227
01:25:44,540 --> 01:25:45,460
We have five minutes to push it.

3228
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:46,320
We can't fuck up.

3229
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:49,240
The Groot.

3230
01:25:49,420 --> 01:25:50,220
You forgot.

3231
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:51,200
It's fine.

3232
01:25:51,260 --> 01:25:52,060
Oh, we have to win.

3233
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:53,960
And then they can't even fight back.

3234
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:54,880
Because it's quick play.

3235
01:25:55,220 --> 01:25:55,580
Exactly.

3236
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:56,000
That's so true.

3237
01:25:56,460 --> 01:25:57,600
We're demoralizing them.

3238
01:25:58,140 --> 01:25:58,880
Guys, they have a cap.

3239
01:25:59,020 --> 01:25:59,820
And an Ultron.

3240
01:25:59,820 --> 01:26:00,740
I have one.

3241
01:26:01,460 --> 01:26:02,940
No, we don't have it.

3242
01:26:05,020 --> 01:26:07,360
These guys are like comboing like it's a rank game.

3243
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:07,620
Tap on point.

3244
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:09,540
There's like no changes on them.

3245
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:10,360
We're not gonna have them.

3246
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:11,620
On the point, on the point.

3247
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:12,360
Captain America, on the point.

3248
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:13,340
Oh, I can't.

3249
01:26:13,380 --> 01:26:14,160
This guy really wants us.

3250
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:15,080
This guy really wants us.

3251
01:26:15,220 --> 01:26:16,240
I beat X.

3252
01:26:17,420 --> 01:26:18,460
I'm building it.

3253
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:19,760
How long?

3254
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:20,700
Guys, I need a little bit of healing.

3255
01:26:20,980 --> 01:26:21,580
Here you go.

3256
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:23,380
It's all right.

3257
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:24,120
I'm eating the Strange.

3258
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:25,200
This is your healing.

3259
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:25,520
I got it soon.

3260
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:25,980
Eat him.

3261
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:26,460
Eat him.

3262
01:26:27,700 --> 01:26:28,020
Oh.

3263
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:28,580
I have it.

3264
01:26:28,580 --> 01:26:28,900
I have it.

3265
01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:29,100
I'm dancing.

3266
01:26:30,780 --> 01:26:32,320
Three, two, one.

3267
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:32,980
It's over.

3268
01:26:33,340 --> 01:26:33,960
I can't do it.

3269
01:26:34,460 --> 01:26:35,100
I'm ready whenever.

3270
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:39,260
A thousand cuts.

3271
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:41,180
There's a Captain America on me.

3272
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:42,440
He has no heals.

3273
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:44,080
He's won.

3274
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:45,980
I'm in the spawn.

3275
01:26:46,140 --> 01:26:47,280
The voice line too.

3276
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:48,400
Dude.

3277
01:26:48,540 --> 01:26:49,200
You did it.

3278
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:50,060
You did the combo.

3279
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:51,480
I buried the light.

3280
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:52,280
Watch out.

3281
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:52,520
He's dancing.

3282
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:53,700
Bursing on me.

3283
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:54,280
On me.

3284
01:26:54,780 --> 01:26:56,780
Okay, but they're all like respawned already.

3285
01:26:57,100 --> 01:26:57,200
So.

3286
01:26:57,740 --> 01:26:58,300
Oh, shit.

3287
01:26:58,300 --> 01:26:59,740
Oh, no.

3288
01:26:59,780 --> 01:27:00,380
He's doing it bad.

3289
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:01,200
I have to reload.

3290
01:27:01,420 --> 01:27:02,140
Ben, don't go.

3291
01:27:02,820 --> 01:27:03,720
I had to reload.

3292
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:04,880
I got him.

3293
01:27:06,140 --> 01:27:06,640
Oh, wow.

3294
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:07,600
Eyes around the wall.

3295
01:27:08,740 --> 01:27:09,900
Oh, my god.

3296
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:11,260
Please.

3297
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:12,720
I can't heal forever.

3298
01:27:15,460 --> 01:27:16,660
I'm returning slowly.

3299
01:27:18,020 --> 01:27:18,540
No, guys.

3300
01:27:18,540 --> 01:27:19,120
We lost his fight.

3301
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:19,780
Why did we go mad?

3302
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:22,580
It's okay.

3303
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:23,700
We have another combo.

3304
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:25,200
Oh, no.

3305
01:27:26,580 --> 01:27:27,000
Oh, my god.

3306
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:27,880
I'm trying my heart.

3307
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:28,460
No, big.

3308
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:29,060
This is big.

3309
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:30,620
I'm healing too.

3310
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:31,220
I'm healing too.

3311
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:32,520
I'm also healing.

3312
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:34,080
Oh, this is big.

3313
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:34,840
You're healing.

3314
01:27:35,820 --> 01:27:36,640
I killed him.

3315
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:37,380
Please did.

3316
01:27:38,260 --> 01:27:39,200
I got that ultron.

3317
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:39,680
Get him.

3318
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:40,260
Quick his ass.

3319
01:27:40,740 --> 01:27:41,160
Oh, my god.

3320
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:42,000
Got him.

3321
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:43,080
Nice, nice.

3322
01:27:44,700 --> 01:27:46,060
Game-winning heals right there.

3323
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:47,520
I will ult in a second.

3324
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:48,700
I'm holding it.

3325
01:27:49,860 --> 01:27:50,180
Yep.

3326
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:51,160
Using it.

3327
01:27:52,820 --> 01:27:55,000
Ours is much better than theirs.

3328
01:27:55,540 --> 01:27:56,260
Yeah, I believe.

3329
01:27:59,740 --> 01:28:00,160
All right.

3330
01:28:00,260 --> 01:28:00,840
You got a mecha blow?

3331
01:28:01,060 --> 01:28:02,160
Three, two, one.

3332
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:02,680
It's gone.

3333
01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:03,920
It's fine.

3334
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:04,520
I have ult.

3335
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:05,400
I may have points in my ult.

3336
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:06,120
Hell, yeah.

3337
01:28:08,060 --> 01:28:09,000
No, we need that for the group.

3338
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:09,280
I'm ahead.

3339
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:10,040
All right, here we go.

3340
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:12,380
I'm sorry, Surefour.

3341
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:14,140
If you did, one more second.

3342
01:28:14,340 --> 01:28:15,080
It's okay, it's okay.

3343
01:28:18,180 --> 01:28:19,660
I don't have combo.

3344
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:21,040
I may have wasted it.

3345
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:22,800
That's why I'm getting strange with hair.

3346
01:28:23,740 --> 01:28:24,340
Oh, huge.

3347
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:25,080
Oh, that's good.

3348
01:28:25,180 --> 01:28:25,380
That's good.

3349
01:28:25,420 --> 01:28:25,780
That's the scene.

3350
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:26,200
That's the scene.

3351
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:26,540
Cook him.

3352
01:28:26,700 --> 01:28:27,020
Cook him.

3353
01:28:27,220 --> 01:28:27,580
Beautiful.

3354
01:28:27,820 --> 01:28:28,100
He's one.

3355
01:28:28,180 --> 01:28:28,500
He's one.

3356
01:28:28,820 --> 01:28:29,220
Ultron.

3357
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:29,740
One.

3358
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:30,980
I'll run that.

3359
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:31,880
Lunapoi!

3360
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:32,820
No, no, no, no.

3361
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:33,520
Lunapoi!

3362
01:28:35,420 --> 01:28:36,160
Blade, Blade!

3363
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:38,340
Frozen, nice.

3364
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:39,040
Yippee!

3365
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:40,040
Dude, I still got it.

3366
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:43,900
Oh, these guys got the roads.

3367
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:48,720
That was just a sword fest between me and the Captain America.

3368
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:49,740
What?

3369
01:28:51,260 --> 01:28:55,000
See, we were fucking around in the last match and it was still close.

3370
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,720
Yeah, we turned on.

3371
01:28:56,920 --> 01:28:57,420
I was boiling.

3372
01:28:58,180 --> 01:28:59,080
You were boiling?

3373
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:01,300
You're boning.

3374
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:02,940
Dude, no, shut up.

3375
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:07,380
I was getting into business.

3376
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:09,060
Holy.

3377
01:29:09,780 --> 01:29:10,540
Remember that?

3378
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:11,920
Yippee, dude.

3379
01:29:12,260 --> 01:29:14,320
Wait, did they swap sites because they want to beat us?

3380
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:14,680
No?

3381
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:14,960
Yeah.

3382
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:16,480
Was that why they swapped sites?

3383
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:19,040
Oh, he said oops started same map.

3384
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:19,340
Yeah.

3385
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:20,560
Oh, sure.

3386
01:29:23,660 --> 01:29:24,240
Sure.

3387
01:29:25,940 --> 01:29:27,200
It's a little oopsie.

3388
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:28,280
Are you stupid?

3389
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:30,760
That's why you got to ask him then.

3390
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:36,360
Yeah, you can put versions in check.

3391
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:38,200
Let's see.

3392
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:39,540
I am Loki.

3393
01:29:40,060 --> 01:29:41,560
I mean, Loki's really good on this one.

3394
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:42,520
I know Bruce can't change it.

3395
01:29:43,940 --> 01:29:45,680
Well, I think I can mute on Discord whenever.

3396
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:48,100
You have to do admin mode.

3397
01:29:48,160 --> 01:29:49,000
You have to launch.

3398
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:50,680
Do you need to launch in admin?

3399
01:29:51,140 --> 01:29:51,280
Yeah.

3400
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:51,500
Yeah, yeah.

3401
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:51,800
Yeah, yeah.

3402
01:29:52,660 --> 01:29:56,420
And then you can play this on August 8th, free to play with Blade.

3403
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:57,800
Oh.

3404
01:29:58,040 --> 01:29:58,780
True, true.

3405
01:29:58,860 --> 01:29:58,980
What date?

3406
01:29:59,100 --> 01:29:59,400
What date?

3407
01:29:59,700 --> 01:30:00,420
August 8th.

3408
01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:01,300
August 8th.

3409
01:30:01,340 --> 01:30:02,020
That's a week.

3410
01:30:02,260 --> 01:30:02,640
Yeah.

3411
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:04,060
In a week, guys.

3412
01:30:04,260 --> 01:30:05,980
And every hero is free to play.

3413
01:30:05,980 --> 01:30:06,380
Just a week away.

3414
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:07,760
Blade is just a week away, guys.

3415
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:09,420
Even Fanfan's dog is excited.

3416
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:10,640
That's crazy.

3417
01:30:10,940 --> 01:30:12,560
He's like, August what?

3418
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:14,220
August what?

3419
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:19,320
The battle starts in 5th.

3420
01:30:19,860 --> 01:30:23,340
How come seeing guy hogs is because Moxie doesn't like to play Blade?

3421
01:30:26,180 --> 01:30:28,140
I think I need to keep the map.

3422
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:29,680
Why are we like...

3423
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:30,800
Why aren't we defending?

3424
01:30:31,820 --> 01:30:33,260
I mean, I mean...

3425
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:34,920
Why did they play...

3426
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:36,620
Why are we on offense again?

3427
01:30:37,420 --> 01:30:38,080
That's a damn.

3428
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:41,100
Why are we doing this all over again?

3429
01:30:41,820 --> 01:30:43,360
Why are you in main, in main, in main.

3430
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:43,500
He won.

3431
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:44,660
Get out of here.

3432
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:46,440
We can do this again.

3433
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:52,920
Did this guy literally restart to try and win again so they can make a YouTube video about beating XTC three times in a row?

3434
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:53,900
There's a guy I got.

3435
01:30:54,220 --> 01:30:55,060
Here you go.

3436
01:30:55,420 --> 01:30:55,780
I'm with you, bro.

3437
01:30:55,780 --> 01:30:56,580
I used lap though for it.

3438
01:30:57,800 --> 01:30:58,560
No laps, no laps.

3439
01:30:58,700 --> 01:30:59,420
I got him, I got him, I got him.

3440
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:00,340
No worries.

3441
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:02,120
Wait, Andrew's on Squirrel Girl.

3442
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:03,380
Yeah, he's been playing Squirrel Girl.

3443
01:31:03,380 --> 01:31:04,820
Yeah, he's been playing Squirrel Girl.

3444
01:31:04,820 --> 01:31:05,640
I'll stop behind you guys.

3445
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:06,420
He's low lap.

3446
01:31:06,740 --> 01:31:06,960
I died.

3447
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:07,600
Oh, no.

3448
01:31:08,060 --> 01:31:08,140
Oh, no.

3449
01:31:08,140 --> 01:31:09,000
You got a murder right there.

3450
01:31:09,180 --> 01:31:09,980
Guys, I didn't know that.

3451
01:31:09,980 --> 01:31:10,460
Oh, no.

3452
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:11,600
Nice.

3453
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:14,260
Wait, they're putting everyone on their mains.

3454
01:31:18,620 --> 01:31:20,440
Except for Andrew on Squirrel Girl.

3455
01:31:20,860 --> 01:31:23,500
No, that's actually a character he plays in my run games.

3456
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:26,680
But like, because he hates you?

3457
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:27,980
He's a Squirrel Girl Venom player.

3458
01:31:28,120 --> 01:31:28,460
No, no, no.

3459
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:29,820
He thinks it's actually good.

3460
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:34,140
Isn't there like a really actual, really good Squirrel Girl player in the EU?

3461
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:35,800
I couldn't hear you.

3462
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:36,760
I'll be honest with you.

3463
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:37,940
Clear, clear upstairs.

3464
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:38,740
Go do up.

3465
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:39,660
Clear comms, guys.

3466
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:40,420
Clear comms.

3467
01:31:41,620 --> 01:31:42,400
Oh, jeez.

3468
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:43,100
I'm cold.

3469
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:45,500
I used lamps because of this.

3470
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:46,120
Vendor, Vendor, Vendor.

3471
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,300
I have my ult.

3472
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:52,160
I'm trying to help you guys.

3473
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:54,220
Oh, my God.

3474
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:55,860
You guys, come here, come here, come here.

3475
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:56,780
I'm stuck.

3476
01:31:57,080 --> 01:31:57,320
Goodbye.

3477
01:31:57,780 --> 01:31:58,160
It's okay.

3478
01:31:58,280 --> 01:31:59,300
You got health kills.

3479
01:31:59,540 --> 01:31:59,780
Thank you.

3480
01:31:59,940 --> 01:32:00,100
Goop.

3481
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:02,660
I got the group kills.

3482
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:03,640
What?

3483
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:05,720
Oh, my God.

3484
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:06,640
What happened?

3485
01:32:07,580 --> 01:32:08,000
What happened?

3486
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:09,140
That can't be good.

3487
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:09,720
I don't even know.

3488
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:10,860
I think shotgun and nut.

3489
01:32:12,180 --> 01:32:12,780
Oh, my God.

3490
01:32:12,780 --> 01:32:14,280
I can die through my ult like that?

3491
01:32:14,420 --> 01:32:16,140
I don't need to do the confirmed thing.

3492
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:16,920
Bleh.

3493
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:21,660
There's a confirmed thing for Loki's.

3494
01:32:23,140 --> 01:32:23,460
Don't worry.

3495
01:32:23,540 --> 01:32:24,180
We almost have combo.

3496
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:24,900
We almost have combo.

3497
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:25,580
We're almost there.

3498
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:25,960
Wait.

3499
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:27,400
He's actually still got it.

3500
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:28,100
He's still got it.

3501
01:32:28,180 --> 01:32:28,600
He's still got it.

3502
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:29,100
I'm going to bubble you.

3503
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:29,760
Oh, you're good.

3504
01:32:29,940 --> 01:32:30,220
Oh, my God.

3505
01:32:30,340 --> 01:32:30,760
A healing bubble.

3506
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:31,020
Okay.

3507
01:32:31,140 --> 01:32:31,960
That's the Groot right there.

3508
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:32,840
That's the Groot.

3509
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:33,920
Can you kill the blade?

3510
01:32:34,040 --> 01:32:35,040
And he's got another one.

3511
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:36,060
All right, guys.

3512
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:36,600
Oh, he's so talented.

3513
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:37,360
Blade 1.

3514
01:32:37,580 --> 01:32:38,880
We're heading over to you guys.

3515
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:39,280
I'm here.

3516
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:41,220
Oh, my God.

3517
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:41,960
Oh, my God.

3518
01:32:42,180 --> 01:32:43,840
I have many faces.

3519
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:45,840
Don't worry.

3520
01:32:46,620 --> 01:32:47,160
There's a Groot on the cart.

3521
01:32:47,180 --> 01:32:47,700
There's a Groot on the cart.

3522
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:51,180
There's a fake Groot on the cart, guys.

3523
01:32:51,580 --> 01:32:51,860
Coming.

3524
01:32:52,180 --> 01:32:53,580
He is still alive.

3525
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:54,580
We don't have combo anymore.

3526
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:56,820
We don't need combo.

3527
01:32:57,300 --> 01:32:57,680
I saw the lag.

3528
01:32:58,080 --> 01:32:58,900
No more combo.

3529
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:00,300
Put a healing bubble.

3530
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:00,660
Oh.

3531
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:02,380
Almost there.

3532
01:33:02,380 --> 01:33:03,180
I'm in though.

3533
01:33:03,180 --> 01:33:03,680
I'm in though.

3534
01:33:03,900 --> 01:33:03,920
I'm in.

3535
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:04,340
He's always up.

3536
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:05,020
I'm in.

3537
01:33:05,020 --> 01:33:05,320
I'm in.

3538
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:05,600
I'm in.

3539
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:08,240
Oh, my God.

3540
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:08,800
Nice lamps.

3541
01:33:11,300 --> 01:33:12,080
Why can't I?

3542
01:33:13,340 --> 01:33:14,180
Oh, my God.

3543
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:16,080
I couldn't fucking get to you.

3544
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:17,140
It's fine.

3545
01:33:17,540 --> 01:33:18,880
Oh, you see me.

3546
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:20,260
Nah, I hooked them.

3547
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:21,680
Nice.

3548
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:22,740
See, they didn't want to go.

3549
01:33:22,740 --> 01:33:24,240
They were so scared of my Groot.

3550
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:24,960
Guys, can you push up?

3551
01:33:25,060 --> 01:33:25,500
Can you push up?

3552
01:33:25,620 --> 01:33:25,980
Clear crumbs.

3553
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:26,380
Clear crumbs.

3554
01:33:26,540 --> 01:33:26,760
Push up.

3555
01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:27,080
Push up.

3556
01:33:27,180 --> 01:33:27,580
I got this.

3557
01:33:28,180 --> 01:33:28,760
I got to win this.

3558
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:29,440
All right.

3559
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:30,040
I'm pushed up.

3560
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:30,980
I'm pushed up with you.

3561
01:33:31,580 --> 01:33:32,060
I'm out.

3562
01:33:32,060 --> 01:33:32,080
Beautiful.

3563
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:33,180
Behind you.

3564
01:33:34,420 --> 01:33:36,800
You're getting three Loki clones healing you.

3565
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:40,500
I'm just going to get in the cockpit a little bit.

3566
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:41,700
Okay, he's on his main.

3567
01:33:41,900 --> 01:33:43,860
They're actually all just on their mains.

3568
01:33:45,260 --> 01:33:48,340
They actually restarted just to try and get another win.

3569
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:52,360
Okay, that'll be so embarrassing for them if they lose again, right?

3570
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:54,240
I canceled his tether.

3571
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:55,320
I canceled his thing.

3572
01:33:55,620 --> 01:33:56,680
Nice, nice, nice.

3573
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:57,160
No passive.

3574
01:33:58,760 --> 01:33:59,860
Why is no one helping me?

3575
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:00,500
I can't get him.

3576
01:34:00,580 --> 01:34:01,000
I can't get him.

3577
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:01,960
He's low.

3578
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:03,400
He's low.

3579
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:03,740
He's so low.

3580
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:05,060
Oh, I didn't have him.

3581
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:05,820
And then I die.

3582
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:07,000
And then...

3583
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,600
Why did you just get all my kids on the ground?

3584
01:34:11,660 --> 01:34:12,320
I'm going to die.

3585
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:12,780
I'm going to die.

3586
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:13,740
I'm going to die.

3587
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:14,660
With the gunman.

3588
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:15,180
Hello?

3589
01:34:16,020 --> 01:34:17,320
He was running away.

3590
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:20,240
He ran into his team.

3591
01:34:22,020 --> 01:34:23,280
I think he's as bad as this.

3592
01:34:23,460 --> 01:34:24,060
I'm coming back.

3593
01:34:24,220 --> 01:34:25,160
I have my ultimate.

3594
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:26,160
You don't understand.

3595
01:34:26,380 --> 01:34:27,300
They need that ad revenue.

3596
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:28,220
Ultimate.

3597
01:34:29,140 --> 01:34:29,520
Ultimate.

3598
01:34:30,220 --> 01:34:31,260
Guys, there's a BP right side.

3599
01:34:31,420 --> 01:34:31,820
Diff him, Oxi.

3600
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:32,100
Diff him.

3601
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:33,600
Wait, I don't...

3602
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:33,800
Oh.

3603
01:34:35,220 --> 01:34:35,360
Oh.

3604
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:36,400
Oh.

3605
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:37,400
Oh.

3606
01:34:37,660 --> 01:34:37,800
Oh.

3607
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:39,820
Oh.

3608
01:34:39,820 --> 01:34:39,840
Oh.

3609
01:34:40,620 --> 01:34:40,920
Oh.

3610
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:41,700
Oh.

3611
01:34:41,700 --> 01:34:43,280
You're looking at the enemy not the friendly.

3612
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:45,360
No, I'm looking at my healer.

3613
01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:46,960
Ben-Fan, we need heals.

3614
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:47,620
We need heal.

3615
01:34:47,700 --> 01:34:48,880
We need a little bit of healing.

3616
01:34:49,260 --> 01:34:50,160
I see you.

3617
01:34:50,460 --> 01:34:52,560
We have Doki Bird alive.

3618
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:54,160
I see you.

3619
01:34:54,180 --> 01:34:54,800
I was behind you.

3620
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:55,520
Okay, well, I can't.

3621
01:34:55,540 --> 01:34:55,840
That is...

3622
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:56,960
No, you can't pay it away.

3623
01:34:57,180 --> 01:34:57,880
I don't see you.

3624
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:58,680
You can't pay it away.

3625
01:34:59,220 --> 01:35:00,320
Just cut, just cut.

3626
01:35:00,340 --> 01:35:00,740
You know what?

3627
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:01,800
I'm not looking at Doki Bird anymore.

3628
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:02,440
That's it.

3629
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,680
I'm not laughing her either.

3630
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:16,220
Oh, that's a big one.

3631
01:35:16,340 --> 01:35:16,800
That's a big one.

3632
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:17,620
Oh, no, there's an in war.

3633
01:35:17,620 --> 01:35:17,940
It's me!

3634
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:18,640
That's huge.

3635
01:35:19,620 --> 01:35:20,180
It's massive.

3636
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:21,440
There's massive.

3637
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:22,820
No follow-up.

3638
01:35:22,940 --> 01:35:24,180
I need one damage there.

3639
01:35:24,340 --> 01:35:25,440
One damage.

3640
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:25,860
One damage.

3641
01:35:26,220 --> 01:35:27,800
Why can't we get one damage there?

3642
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:28,600
There's so many people.

3643
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:30,960
Because I was peeling my back line.

3644
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:33,120
No lab, no lab.

3645
01:35:33,420 --> 01:35:34,380
He has all the...

3646
01:35:34,380 --> 01:35:37,380
They both started saying they're not going to peel each other.

3647
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:39,020
So I had to be the one to peel.

3648
01:35:39,380 --> 01:35:40,220
No, I'm peeling her.

3649
01:35:40,380 --> 01:35:40,600
Of course.

3650
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:41,160
What the hell?

3651
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:42,780
She's my priority.

3652
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:43,320
What?

3653
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:45,360
She's my priority.

3654
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:46,380
I'm just playing horse-eye.

3655
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:48,660
What do you mean I was texting bro?

3656
01:35:48,820 --> 01:35:49,860
I was texting everyone.

3657
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:54,880
I made a Venn diagram and everything.

3658
01:35:55,260 --> 01:35:55,280
The wolf's coming out.

3659
01:35:55,380 --> 01:35:55,800
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

3660
01:35:56,340 --> 01:35:57,720
Do I just ignore the Venom?

3661
01:35:57,820 --> 01:35:59,240
I think I'm the only one shooting it.

3662
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:01,920
I got him.

3663
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:03,140
I got him.

3664
01:36:03,660 --> 01:36:04,860
I might just...

3665
01:36:04,860 --> 01:36:05,940
I have to dive them, I think.

3666
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:06,920
Oh my, I'm just...

3667
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:07,520
Bubble for you.

3668
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:08,280
You are so...

3669
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:09,600
Tried to solo off the Venom.

3670
01:36:10,060 --> 01:36:10,600
Damn right.

3671
01:36:12,020 --> 01:36:12,840
He's one, he's one.

3672
01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:13,860
He's actually one.

3673
01:36:14,180 --> 01:36:15,060
Guys, can you heal me up?

3674
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:15,620
Can I get a lamb?

3675
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:16,240
No.

3676
01:36:16,820 --> 01:36:17,400
We have to use him.

3677
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:18,780
We're getting terrorized back here.

3678
01:36:19,060 --> 01:36:19,340
Buy what?

3679
01:36:19,340 --> 01:36:19,800
Buy what?

3680
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:20,180
Buy what?

3681
01:36:20,300 --> 01:36:21,800
Buy what?

3682
01:36:22,020 --> 01:36:23,240
Why is this guy?

3683
01:36:24,140 --> 01:36:24,720
I don't have...

3684
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:25,000
I don't have...

3685
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:25,400
I don't have...

3686
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:26,880
Oh my, goodbye.

3687
01:36:27,060 --> 01:36:28,040
Your supports are at you too.

3688
01:36:28,060 --> 01:36:29,400
Why is X to see on fucking BP?

3689
01:36:29,860 --> 01:36:30,860
Bro, I just...

3690
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:32,500
I said I have to dive them.

3691
01:36:33,060 --> 01:36:34,660
You have to dive this, bro?

3692
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:35,280
Let him cook.

3693
01:36:35,480 --> 01:36:36,100
Let him cook.

3694
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:37,500
Oh, we're so frightened.

3695
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:38,680
Oh, he sees my link.

3696
01:36:39,140 --> 01:36:39,860
He's slept, bro.

3697
01:36:41,060 --> 01:36:44,120
Guys, we're gonna be a YouTube video, guys.

3698
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:46,720
Bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro.

3699
01:36:46,740 --> 01:36:50,700
This candy player has like a fascination to annoying me.

3700
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:51,360
Like, it's...

3701
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:54,060
She's rage baiting, rage baiting.

3702
01:36:54,160 --> 01:36:55,020
She's rage baiting.

3703
01:36:55,300 --> 01:36:57,020
I'm getting TikTok farmed again.

3704
01:36:57,500 --> 01:36:57,700
Uh...

3705
01:36:57,700 --> 01:36:58,480
So you can...

3706
01:36:58,480 --> 01:36:59,160
Oh, no, he's here.

3707
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:01,680
He's one, he's...

3708
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:02,600
Oh, he's so low.

3709
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:04,080
Holy shit.

3710
01:37:04,340 --> 01:37:05,000
I need a little bit.

3711
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:05,900
Here, here, here, here's the lab.

3712
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:07,160
Look at you, look at you.

3713
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:09,120
I'm ulting, I'm ulting.

3714
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:12,400
Oh, I can't...

3715
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:13,400
Oh, my use...

3716
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:15,560
There is a Panther behind us.

3717
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:20,720
There's a Venom behind us, too.

3718
01:37:21,060 --> 01:37:22,100
In here, in here, in here.

3719
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:22,880
In the tunnel.

3720
01:37:23,940 --> 01:37:25,280
Guys, Venom's on point, Venom's on point.

3721
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:25,800
Venom won.

3722
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:26,780
He's one HP.

3723
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:27,280
Oh, beautiful.

3724
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:28,720
Okay, I believe in you, XQC.

3725
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:29,420
You got this.

3726
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:30,240
You're faster than him.

3727
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:31,040
Wait, it's a 1v1.

3728
01:37:31,140 --> 01:37:31,500
It's a 1v1.

3729
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:32,220
Yeah, 1v1.

3730
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:32,840
1v1.

3731
01:37:33,940 --> 01:37:34,580
Guys, there's...

3732
01:37:34,580 --> 01:37:35,360
Wait, watch the 1v1.

3733
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:37,400
Guys, it's a 1v1, not a 5.

3734
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:38,460
Guys, guys, they're on cart.

3735
01:37:38,740 --> 01:37:39,240
They're on...

3736
01:37:39,240 --> 01:37:39,360
Guys.

3737
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:40,040
Oh, shit.

3738
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:40,360
Okay.

3739
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:41,600
We're watching.

3740
01:37:41,740 --> 01:37:42,140
We're watching.

3741
01:37:44,700 --> 01:37:45,720
Is Shrefour winning?

3742
01:37:46,420 --> 01:37:48,320
Oh my god, I'm nearly on.

3743
01:37:48,340 --> 01:37:50,060
My ship got cancelled.

3744
01:37:51,220 --> 01:37:52,100
I'm healing, I'm healing.

3745
01:37:52,100 --> 01:37:52,860
Oh, kill this guy, kill this guy.

3746
01:37:53,320 --> 01:37:53,560
Oh, beautiful.

3747
01:37:53,860 --> 01:37:54,000
Nice.

3748
01:37:54,820 --> 01:37:56,980
I tried to block the damage, but I took the damage.

3749
01:37:56,980 --> 01:37:57,100
Oh, that's a huge one.

3750
01:37:57,100 --> 01:37:57,220
Oh, that's a huge one.

3751
01:37:57,280 --> 01:37:57,940
Nice, nice.

3752
01:38:00,020 --> 01:38:00,660
Venom on point.

3753
01:38:00,980 --> 01:38:01,100
Yeah.

3754
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:04,000
Venom, I landed, but he's just on cart.

3755
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:04,760
Black Panther on point.

3756
01:38:07,740 --> 01:38:10,120
Oh, it's okay.

3757
01:38:10,280 --> 01:38:11,180
I'm slowly heading over.

3758
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:11,860
Maybe I'll get him.

3759
01:38:11,860 --> 01:38:12,000
Venom.

3760
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:14,280
What's that ult?

3761
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:15,280
What are we doing with this?

3762
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:16,120
That is so unlucky.

3763
01:38:16,280 --> 01:38:16,880
What are we doing with this?

3764
01:38:18,740 --> 01:38:19,060
Damn.

3765
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:20,180
Guys, I believe you.

3766
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:21,280
Venom.

3767
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:23,880
Guys, ult, ult, ult.

3768
01:38:24,860 --> 01:38:26,300
Okay, Moxie hits a big ult, we win.

3769
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:27,240
Yeah, I'm reloaded.

3770
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:28,240
Yeah, this is on me.

3771
01:38:28,780 --> 01:38:29,060
Oh, you.

3772
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:30,440
If we don't win this, it's because of you.

3773
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:31,540
I can combo your ult soon.

3774
01:38:32,540 --> 01:38:33,400
Okay, okay.

3775
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:35,100
I'm doing a reload.

3776
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:35,680
I have it.

3777
01:38:35,680 --> 01:38:35,880
All right.

3778
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:41,240
I had to ult, lamb.

3779
01:38:42,240 --> 01:38:43,940
Okay, I'm, I'm in the...

3780
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:46,200
Oh, no.

3781
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:47,120
Uh-oh.

3782
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:47,800
Intect the Venom ult.

3783
01:38:48,140 --> 01:38:49,820
All right, you need a big one here, Moxie.

3784
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:50,980
Yeah, you need to do it now.

3785
01:38:50,980 --> 01:38:51,300
I got two.

3786
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:52,800
You gotta do it now.

3787
01:38:53,120 --> 01:38:53,780
I ulted it.

3788
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:54,560
Nice, nice.

3789
01:38:54,700 --> 01:38:54,920
Do the Jeff.

3790
01:38:55,100 --> 01:38:55,820
Yeah, no supports.

3791
01:38:55,940 --> 01:38:56,600
There's no Venom.

3792
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:56,900
Venom.

3793
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:57,960
I can't.

3794
01:38:58,100 --> 01:38:58,620
No supports.

3795
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:02,480
I'm fleeing back.

3796
01:39:02,820 --> 01:39:03,700
Don't see none.

3797
01:39:03,820 --> 01:39:04,980
I'm with the Venom.

3798
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:05,740
Venom cut.

3799
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:06,800
Nice.

3800
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:08,320
We got that guy, right?

3801
01:39:08,440 --> 01:39:08,780
It's the Jeff.

3802
01:39:08,780 --> 01:39:09,160
No, we got this.

3803
01:39:09,260 --> 01:39:09,480
We got this.

3804
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:10,040
You got this, right?

3805
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:11,280
I'm gonna wait and spawn then.

3806
01:39:11,540 --> 01:39:12,320
Is he fighting the Jeff?

3807
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:13,000
Yeah.

3808
01:39:13,120 --> 01:39:13,260
Yes!

3809
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:14,760
Excuse me.

3810
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:17,480
Dude, you sound like you're being assaulted.

3811
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:18,640
Jeff is with you.

3812
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:20,020
He is being assaulted, bro.

3813
01:39:21,580 --> 01:39:22,240
You guys are killing me?

3814
01:39:22,420 --> 01:39:22,720
You guys are killing me?

3815
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:24,820
Guys, there's a Jeff behind us.

3816
01:39:25,420 --> 01:39:26,780
Oh my god.

3817
01:39:28,240 --> 01:39:28,600
I got the Jeff, I got the Jeff.

3818
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:29,680
Rax, you can't be dying there.

3819
01:39:29,820 --> 01:39:30,080
What the hell is it?

3820
01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:32,240
Manfan was vaping Bubbly and I can tell him.

3821
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:32,820
It's fine.

3822
01:39:33,020 --> 01:39:34,280
I'm healing Bubbly when you walked out of the XQC.

3823
01:39:34,300 --> 01:39:35,980
I have a lamp too and the lamp's gone.

3824
01:39:36,160 --> 01:39:37,000
I don't want to hear it.

3825
01:39:37,180 --> 01:39:37,660
The lamp's gone.

3826
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:38,500
I know, I know, I know.

3827
01:39:40,060 --> 01:39:40,940
Oh my god.

3828
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:41,880
There's one, I know, I know.

3829
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:43,100
I'm sucking off my answers.

3830
01:39:43,180 --> 01:39:43,820
There's someone on cart.

3831
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:44,460
There's someone on cart.

3832
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,460
Don't worry, I got the Jeff for you.

3833
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:51,260
Jeff cut.

3834
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:52,760
Jeff down, major.

3835
01:39:53,020 --> 01:39:53,640
Major kill.

3836
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:55,560
Major confirmed.

3837
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:57,340
XQC, you're fine.

3838
01:39:57,900 --> 01:39:59,400
Yeah, I killed your Tulpa.

3839
01:40:01,220 --> 01:40:02,640
Healing for my friends.

3840
01:40:04,980 --> 01:40:05,660
We're thriving.

3841
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:06,820
You got me.

3842
01:40:07,100 --> 01:40:08,300
You got me.

3843
01:40:08,300 --> 01:40:10,060
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

3844
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:13,160
Oh, we are holding down this cart so hard.

3845
01:40:13,420 --> 01:40:14,060
That's it.

3846
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:16,220
Don't let anything stay in your way.

3847
01:40:16,300 --> 01:40:16,980
Actually, hold all.

3848
01:40:17,060 --> 01:40:18,200
I almost have, I almost have all.

3849
01:40:19,540 --> 01:40:20,560
I said hold!

3850
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:23,300
Hold!

3851
01:40:24,580 --> 01:40:25,880
He's so low, he's so low.

3852
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:26,840
I said just, I'm sure.

3853
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:28,480
How am I dying?

3854
01:40:28,720 --> 01:40:29,420
He's so low.

3855
01:40:29,700 --> 01:40:29,760
He's so low.

3856
01:40:30,660 --> 01:40:31,540
We're peeling.

3857
01:40:33,100 --> 01:40:34,220
Oh my god.

3858
01:40:34,740 --> 01:40:35,100
Where are you?

3859
01:40:35,220 --> 01:40:35,920
Oh my god, I'm gonna die.

3860
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:36,480
He's fine.

3861
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:37,060
I'm done, i'm done, I'm done.

3862
01:40:37,060 --> 01:40:38,280
You're fine, I'm done, you're fine.

3863
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:42,860
All use.

3864
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:45,460
That's fine.

3865
01:40:45,820 --> 01:40:46,460
We're so fine.

3866
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,400
Dude, I'm...

3867
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:49,280
Oh my god.

3868
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,660
Oh, that's not good.

3869
01:40:54,020 --> 01:40:54,660
Any TP's?

3870
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:56,240
Any TP's in chat?

3871
01:40:58,280 --> 01:40:58,860
I know.

3872
01:40:59,100 --> 01:41:00,400
Are you guys okay over there?

3873
01:41:01,420 --> 01:41:01,420
Winnable.

3874
01:41:01,420 --> 01:41:01,980
Yeah, winnable.

3875
01:41:02,120 --> 01:41:02,600
I'm gonna TP you guys.

3876
01:41:02,660 --> 01:41:03,280
Okay, winnable.

3877
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:04,420
BP1.

3878
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:05,560
I have to lap.

3879
01:41:07,940 --> 01:41:08,540
I'm healing you.

3880
01:41:08,620 --> 01:41:09,020
I'm healing you.

3881
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:11,860
Guys, if you stay alive a little bit... I have to reload.

3882
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:12,900
Oh, no!

3883
01:41:13,640 --> 01:41:13,640
No!

3884
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:13,940
No!

3885
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:16,360
I can't!

3886
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:16,880
I can't get there!

3887
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:17,280
No, no, no.

3888
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:17,760
We have portal.

3889
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:18,300
We have portal.

3890
01:41:18,300 --> 01:41:19,420
I can't get there!

3891
01:41:19,900 --> 01:41:20,840
I don't...

3892
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:22,060
Oh, a major clutch!

3893
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:23,740
Quick, quick, quick, quick!

3894
01:41:23,740 --> 01:41:24,200
I need some help.

3895
01:41:24,260 --> 01:41:24,620
I need some help.

3896
01:41:24,780 --> 01:41:25,520
Quick, quick, quick, quick!

3897
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:26,580
Get in, get in!

3898
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:27,320
No!

3899
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:28,200
No!

3900
01:41:28,640 --> 01:41:28,680
No!

3901
01:41:29,240 --> 01:41:29,440
No!

3902
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:34,420
They all had to go on their main characters to get even close to winning.

3903
01:41:34,600 --> 01:41:34,900
That's crazy.

3904
01:41:36,260 --> 01:41:36,400
True.

3905
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:37,620
That's pretty... not gonna lie.

3906
01:41:37,660 --> 01:41:38,280
That's pretty cringe.

3907
01:41:39,480 --> 01:41:42,340
Add four final hits and SVP, blade diff.

3908
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:45,420
So true.

3909
01:41:45,780 --> 01:41:46,020
True, true.

3910
01:41:46,820 --> 01:41:47,120
More damage.

3911
01:41:47,540 --> 01:41:49,020
Unless nowadays, I think we should have triple heal.

3912
01:41:49,120 --> 01:41:50,700
Triple heal against flank, I think, is better.

3913
01:41:50,920 --> 01:41:52,200
I think we should have held the Groot ult.

3914
01:41:52,820 --> 01:41:54,520
I think we should have held the Groot ult.

3915
01:41:55,060 --> 01:41:56,280
Yeah, I agree, I agree.

3916
01:41:56,420 --> 01:41:57,980
I think it was Groot ult.

3917
01:41:58,500 --> 01:41:59,320
So you're gonna be that guy.

3918
01:41:59,580 --> 01:41:59,800
Yeah.

3919
01:42:01,700 --> 01:42:04,620
We're having pre... post-game discussion here.

3920
01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:07,220
And we can VOD review, guys, if you want to.

3921
01:42:07,820 --> 01:42:08,840
Yeah, we can VOD review after.

3922
01:42:08,840 --> 01:42:09,640
We should, we should.

3923
01:42:09,640 --> 01:42:10,380
We should, we should.

3924
01:42:10,620 --> 01:42:11,460
Yeah, I agree, I agree.

3925
01:42:14,620 --> 01:42:16,300
So, like, next game, we just gotta...

3926
01:42:16,300 --> 01:42:18,320
We just gotta ban Black Panther, you know?

3927
01:42:18,620 --> 01:42:19,020
Are we gonna play the same map again?

3928
01:42:19,020 --> 01:42:19,060
Yeah.

3929
01:42:19,660 --> 01:42:21,600
No, they only redo the map if they've lost.

3930
01:42:21,940 --> 01:42:22,880
Yeah, that's true.

3931
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:25,040
It won't even let us defend.

3932
01:42:26,740 --> 01:42:27,540
Hey, VOD is bad?

3933
01:42:28,980 --> 01:42:29,960
Same map again?

3934
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:30,420
Defense?

3935
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:34,640
Oh, Hellfire Gala.

3936
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:47,180
DLS is native.

3937
01:42:48,300 --> 01:42:48,700
Hm?

3938
01:42:49,400 --> 01:42:50,260
DLS is native.

3939
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:53,680
I use...

3940
01:42:54,460 --> 01:42:55,140
You use what, Tote?

3941
01:42:55,960 --> 01:42:56,960
Uh, I'm looking.

3942
01:42:57,200 --> 01:42:58,340
Wait, how do I get to my settings?

3943
01:42:59,700 --> 01:43:01,800
I use performance, and I have...

3944
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:03,480
NVIDIA DLSS on auto.

3945
01:43:04,200 --> 01:43:05,340
Oh, yeah, actually, he's playing the same map.

3946
01:43:05,340 --> 01:43:06,620
Wait, we're playing the same map, guys.

3947
01:43:07,100 --> 01:43:08,820
Oh, my f...

3948
01:43:09,220 --> 01:43:10,060
There's a why.

3949
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:10,720
Why?

3950
01:43:11,140 --> 01:43:11,800
Because I...

3951
01:43:11,800 --> 01:43:15,680
Because Poker and I were, like, same map, but swap defense and attack.

3952
01:43:15,940 --> 01:43:16,920
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

3953
01:43:17,460 --> 01:43:17,860
Really?

3954
01:43:18,620 --> 01:43:21,600
Just play the new map.

3955
01:43:22,640 --> 01:43:23,040
TPH.

3956
01:43:24,540 --> 01:43:25,380
Wait, there's a...

3957
01:43:25,380 --> 01:43:27,160
Oh, my God, I forgot there is a new map.

3958
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:29,960
Like, like...

3959
01:43:29,960 --> 01:43:30,520
I'm crying.

3960
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:32,620
We're doing a sponsor from, like, a year ago.

3961
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:33,620
Come on, dude.

3962
01:43:34,760 --> 01:43:35,560
It's okay, guys.

3963
01:43:35,620 --> 01:43:36,580
We have 20 minutes left.

3964
01:43:40,980 --> 01:43:44,800
Oh, wait, isn't there a new team up with Rocket and Starlord?

3965
01:43:45,080 --> 01:43:45,120
Yes, there is.

3966
01:43:45,120 --> 01:43:45,460
Yes, there is.

3967
01:43:49,810 --> 01:43:51,430
I will willingly play Rocket.

3968
01:43:51,430 --> 01:43:51,770
Oh, wait, I got this one.

3969
01:43:51,910 --> 01:43:52,290
I got this one.

3970
01:43:52,590 --> 01:43:54,530
Wait, unless Fanfan, do you want to play Rocket or no?

3971
01:43:55,430 --> 01:43:56,630
Um, hell no.

3972
01:43:57,030 --> 01:43:59,390
Okay, I will cut off my hands and play Rocket.

3973
01:43:59,870 --> 01:44:01,850
Chat, is the thing any good now?

3974
01:44:02,250 --> 01:44:03,050
Yeah, he's okay.

3975
01:44:03,450 --> 01:44:04,330
Here's the thing.

3976
01:44:04,330 --> 01:44:05,850
Are we actually playing this now?

3977
01:44:06,130 --> 01:44:06,230
You can actually...

3978
01:44:06,230 --> 01:44:08,830
You can jump to enemies now, XTC.

3979
01:44:09,130 --> 01:44:10,450
And punch them out of the air.

3980
01:44:11,010 --> 01:44:11,090
Yeah.

3981
01:44:11,170 --> 01:44:11,910
Yeah, you can jump to enemies.

3982
01:44:12,170 --> 01:44:14,770
You can punch flying characters in the air.

3983
01:44:16,630 --> 01:44:18,310
Back shot and then right click.

3984
01:44:20,230 --> 01:44:20,750
Gotcha.

3985
01:44:21,570 --> 01:44:24,770
The battle starts in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

3986
01:44:24,770 --> 01:44:25,410
You just...

3987
01:44:25,410 --> 01:44:26,970
You spent the whole game, right?

3988
01:44:27,210 --> 01:44:27,470
Pretty much?

3989
01:44:28,070 --> 01:44:30,690
Yeah, and shift when you're low or you need to...

3990
01:44:30,690 --> 01:44:31,670
Nice, Poirot.

3991
01:44:32,050 --> 01:44:33,530
You got the better, Poirot.

3992
01:44:34,710 --> 01:44:35,150
Tiktok.

3993
01:44:35,230 --> 01:44:36,930
I know what I need to do after I die.

3994
01:44:37,750 --> 01:44:38,710
Wait, another one?

3995
01:44:39,490 --> 01:44:40,270
And another one?

3996
01:44:40,270 --> 01:44:40,590
I think...

3997
01:44:40,590 --> 01:44:41,350
I think he was...

3998
01:44:41,350 --> 01:44:42,690
I think he was like, okay, guys.

3999
01:44:42,810 --> 01:44:43,330
I'm just gonna jump.

4000
01:44:44,990 --> 01:44:45,890
The full reset.

4001
01:44:46,290 --> 01:44:46,590
Really, dude?

4002
01:44:47,090 --> 01:44:47,870
Strange old as well.

4003
01:44:48,430 --> 01:44:48,610
Wait.

4004
01:44:49,730 --> 01:44:50,050
Um...

4005
01:44:50,050 --> 01:44:50,650
I hear rad.

4006
01:44:50,910 --> 01:44:51,230
Moxie.

4007
01:44:52,210 --> 01:44:53,450
Yeah, we gotta focus on rad, guys.

4008
01:44:53,650 --> 01:44:53,770
You gotta...

4009
01:44:53,770 --> 01:44:54,850
You gotta switch characters.

4010
01:44:56,330 --> 01:44:56,950
Oh, yeah.

4011
01:44:57,070 --> 01:44:57,510
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4012
01:44:59,070 --> 01:45:00,850
I'm looking at the new Starlord team up.

4013
01:45:01,110 --> 01:45:02,730
Yeah, the new Starlord team up.

4014
01:45:02,730 --> 01:45:02,910
That's fine.

4015
01:45:03,090 --> 01:45:03,970
You can give it a bit.

4016
01:45:04,090 --> 01:45:04,670
You can give it a bit.

4017
01:45:04,910 --> 01:45:05,090
Yo.

4018
01:45:05,670 --> 01:45:06,110
That's okay.

4019
01:45:06,350 --> 01:45:07,150
Oh, my God.

4020
01:45:07,510 --> 01:45:09,050
So who's gonna play the new Starlord?

4021
01:45:12,750 --> 01:45:13,390
Oh, wow.

4022
01:45:15,350 --> 01:45:16,510
Oh, you're so...

4023
01:45:17,330 --> 01:45:18,070
You're so dead.

4024
01:45:18,070 --> 01:45:18,290
No, I'm coming.

4025
01:45:18,530 --> 01:45:18,850
I'm coming.

4026
01:45:19,230 --> 01:45:19,530
I'm coming.

4027
01:45:19,750 --> 01:45:20,850
X is going bladed.

4028
01:45:21,210 --> 01:45:22,230
X is going bladed.

4029
01:45:22,350 --> 01:45:22,530
Wait.

4030
01:45:22,530 --> 01:45:23,050
Oh, my God.

4031
01:45:23,110 --> 01:45:23,570
You're a asshole.

4032
01:45:25,070 --> 01:45:26,290
I don't have rest, by the way.

4033
01:45:26,650 --> 01:45:27,450
They just lapped.

4034
01:45:27,990 --> 01:45:28,910
I hit it, but I did.

4035
01:45:29,370 --> 01:45:30,050
Broken character.

4036
01:45:31,010 --> 01:45:31,510
You hit.

4037
01:45:32,410 --> 01:45:33,730
It looked really cool.

4038
01:45:34,110 --> 01:45:34,510
Thanks.

4039
01:45:34,510 --> 01:45:34,690
Thank you.

4040
01:45:34,710 --> 01:45:35,110
Thank you, guys.

4041
01:45:36,270 --> 01:45:37,590
Why is X shooting bladed now?

4042
01:45:37,590 --> 01:45:38,350
I killed one off of it.

4043
01:45:38,570 --> 01:45:38,650
Okay.

4044
01:45:39,050 --> 01:45:39,470
Just watch.

4045
01:45:40,710 --> 01:45:41,350
Just watch.

4046
01:45:41,650 --> 01:45:42,150
I'm gonna let him cook.

4047
01:45:42,250 --> 01:45:42,590
By the way.

4048
01:45:42,970 --> 01:45:44,230
I learned a thing or two from him, Wade.

4049
01:45:45,770 --> 01:45:46,430
I got this.

4050
01:45:49,370 --> 01:45:49,690
Nice.

4051
01:45:50,290 --> 01:45:50,570
We're watching.

4052
01:45:50,690 --> 01:45:50,950
We're watching.

4053
01:45:52,190 --> 01:45:53,230
Guys, can you break this wall?

4054
01:45:53,410 --> 01:45:54,410
Can we touch point?

4055
01:45:54,670 --> 01:45:55,210
Can we touch?

4056
01:45:55,390 --> 01:45:55,770
No, no.

4057
01:45:56,450 --> 01:45:57,270
Yeah, I got this.

4058
01:45:57,750 --> 01:45:59,330
Oh, I thought it was my F.

4059
01:45:59,470 --> 01:45:59,910
It's my E.

4060
01:45:59,910 --> 01:46:01,610
He doesn't even know what the build is you.

4061
01:46:01,890 --> 01:46:02,790
Oh my god.

4062
01:46:03,150 --> 01:46:03,630
He doesn't even know what the build is you.

4063
01:46:03,630 --> 01:46:03,810
It's okay.

4064
01:46:03,970 --> 01:46:04,350
Just watch.

4065
01:46:04,750 --> 01:46:05,490
Oh, we're getting cooked.

4066
01:46:05,610 --> 01:46:05,930
I'm Eden.

4067
01:46:06,510 --> 01:46:07,910
Oh, someone...

4068
01:46:07,910 --> 01:46:08,590
Okay, I believe.

4069
01:46:08,930 --> 01:46:09,890
Oh, the draft is one!

4070
01:46:12,030 --> 01:46:12,990
What is happening?

4071
01:46:13,950 --> 01:46:15,070
There's so many things.

4072
01:46:15,070 --> 01:46:15,370
I'm doing it.

4073
01:46:15,390 --> 01:46:15,690
I don't know.

4074
01:46:15,770 --> 01:46:16,210
I can't do it.

4075
01:46:16,370 --> 01:46:16,710
I can't.

4076
01:46:17,390 --> 01:46:17,990
I just...

4077
01:46:18,590 --> 01:46:21,090
I just cancelled my TP instead of taking it.

4078
01:46:21,310 --> 01:46:21,870
Oh my god.

4079
01:46:22,030 --> 01:46:22,530
I just...

4080
01:46:23,510 --> 01:46:24,170
Oh my god.

4081
01:46:26,310 --> 01:46:26,950
It's okay.

4082
01:46:26,950 --> 01:46:27,150
What?

4083
01:46:27,150 --> 01:46:27,670
What?

4084
01:46:28,350 --> 01:46:29,810
Why did I get double ootages now?

4085
01:46:31,970 --> 01:46:33,150
I will back up.

4086
01:46:33,150 --> 01:46:34,050
I think because you're the only...

4087
01:46:34,050 --> 01:46:35,210
They're embarrassed from the TP earlier.

4088
01:46:35,870 --> 01:46:36,090
Real.

4089
01:46:36,290 --> 01:46:36,830
Alright, she too.

4090
01:46:39,630 --> 01:46:40,810
Nekros is scary!

4091
01:46:42,290 --> 01:46:42,810
Thanks.

4092
01:46:43,330 --> 01:46:44,430
He's on Loki.

4093
01:46:44,970 --> 01:46:45,230
Yeah.

4094
01:46:45,410 --> 01:46:45,630
I know!

4095
01:46:45,930 --> 01:46:46,930
That's why he's scary.

4096
01:46:47,150 --> 01:46:50,790
I'm actually more scared of Nekros on Loki than any other character.

4097
01:46:51,490 --> 01:46:51,770
What?

4098
01:46:53,790 --> 01:46:54,310
Okay.

4099
01:46:54,770 --> 01:46:55,670
I'll hold first.

4100
01:46:55,750 --> 01:46:56,330
I'll hold first.

4101
01:46:56,950 --> 01:46:57,210
Let's go.

4102
01:46:57,230 --> 01:46:57,690
Let's go.

4103
01:46:57,910 --> 01:46:58,850
We're just gonna break it though.

4104
01:46:58,850 --> 01:47:00,350
You have not been tuned into the support grind then.

4105
01:47:01,350 --> 01:47:01,490
Okay.

4106
01:47:01,890 --> 01:47:02,370
Oh, huge.

4107
01:47:03,550 --> 01:47:03,950
Oh, they're low.

4108
01:47:04,050 --> 01:47:04,250
They're low.

4109
01:47:04,250 --> 01:47:04,450
They're low.

4110
01:47:05,010 --> 01:47:05,230
They lose one.

4111
01:47:05,870 --> 01:47:06,590
They can't.

4112
01:47:06,650 --> 01:47:07,350
Oh, hell no.

4113
01:47:07,590 --> 01:47:08,830
Oh, fuck no.

4114
01:47:09,050 --> 01:47:09,570
That's a nice one.

4115
01:47:11,530 --> 01:47:12,250
That's unfortunate.

4116
01:47:12,890 --> 01:47:13,930
Come back here, you son.

4117
01:47:14,090 --> 01:47:15,510
How are we losing this?

4118
01:47:15,690 --> 01:47:16,430
I lived hard.

4119
01:47:17,970 --> 01:47:18,650
I'm not gonna hold.

4120
01:47:18,770 --> 01:47:19,150
I'm not gonna hold.

4121
01:47:20,010 --> 01:47:20,650
Why not?

4122
01:47:21,450 --> 01:47:21,750
Wait, wait.

4123
01:47:22,030 --> 01:47:22,910
Yeah, do it for sure for it.

4124
01:47:23,510 --> 01:47:24,030
Yeah, yeah.

4125
01:47:24,150 --> 01:47:25,170
We have three people alive.

4126
01:47:25,170 --> 01:47:25,530
Okay.

4127
01:47:27,130 --> 01:47:27,450
Yeah.

4128
01:47:27,750 --> 01:47:28,250
Yeah, see?

4129
01:47:28,470 --> 01:47:28,610
Yeah.

4130
01:47:28,770 --> 01:47:29,170
It's fine.

4131
01:47:29,950 --> 01:47:30,570
Look, we win the fight.

4132
01:47:30,590 --> 01:47:31,690
He pulled out the Wolverine, guys.

4133
01:47:32,370 --> 01:47:32,830
Oh, no.

4134
01:47:32,850 --> 01:47:33,470
They got me angry.

4135
01:47:34,450 --> 01:47:36,150
Oh, you don't want to see him when he's angry.

4136
01:47:36,530 --> 01:47:36,950
Oh, yeah.

4137
01:47:37,070 --> 01:47:38,150
You don't want...

4138
01:47:38,150 --> 01:47:38,910
Just wait.

4139
01:47:39,550 --> 01:47:42,310
Wait, what could be your angle or your devil.

4140
01:47:42,670 --> 01:47:43,070
Alright.

4141
01:47:43,370 --> 01:47:44,290
I'll swap off.

4142
01:47:44,790 --> 01:47:45,530
Drop it when I die.

4143
01:47:45,530 --> 01:47:45,750
Wait, watch this, watch this.

4144
01:47:46,030 --> 01:47:47,270
This is Prime Excusi with right here.

4145
01:47:47,410 --> 01:47:47,710
Give me a sec.

4146
01:47:48,750 --> 01:47:48,930
Yeah.

4147
01:47:50,290 --> 01:47:50,470
Huge.

4148
01:47:51,270 --> 01:47:51,910
Was it a big up?

4149
01:47:52,250 --> 01:47:52,710
Oh, shit.

4150
01:47:52,810 --> 01:47:52,990
It is.

4151
01:47:53,490 --> 01:47:54,610
You can't fuck with Thor.

4152
01:47:55,330 --> 01:47:56,510
I'll pat you up.

4153
01:47:56,670 --> 01:47:56,970
I'll pat you up.

4154
01:47:56,970 --> 01:47:57,630
You're walled off.

4155
01:48:00,770 --> 01:48:01,390
Don't worry.

4156
01:48:01,610 --> 01:48:02,510
I got a...

4157
01:48:02,510 --> 01:48:02,930
Oh, I got him.

4158
01:48:03,310 --> 01:48:04,670
I got res right here.

4159
01:48:05,430 --> 01:48:06,230
They might destroy it.

4160
01:48:06,230 --> 01:48:07,510
I mean, they're getting trolled really hard right now.

4161
01:48:08,270 --> 01:48:09,450
I wasted all their time.

4162
01:48:09,530 --> 01:48:10,150
I wasted all their time.

4163
01:48:10,270 --> 01:48:11,310
I wasted all their time.

4164
01:48:11,530 --> 01:48:11,570
Alright.

4165
01:48:11,570 --> 01:48:11,670
The moment...

4166
01:48:11,670 --> 01:48:14,090
The moment Neko swap off support, we know they're locking in.

4167
01:48:14,170 --> 01:48:14,210
Did you mind controlling them?

4168
01:48:14,210 --> 01:48:14,290
Yeah.

4169
01:48:14,370 --> 01:48:15,250
I mean, pretty hard too, yeah.

4170
01:48:15,890 --> 01:48:16,630
Or locking out.

4171
01:48:20,870 --> 01:48:21,510
Explain how.

4172
01:48:22,810 --> 01:48:23,430
Oh my god.

4173
01:48:23,530 --> 01:48:24,210
Thor mirror match?

4174
01:48:24,550 --> 01:48:25,290
Oh my goodness, bro.

4175
01:48:26,130 --> 01:48:26,430
Oh.

4176
01:48:29,150 --> 01:48:29,770
Oh no.

4177
01:48:29,790 --> 01:48:30,390
How did that grab me?

4178
01:48:31,050 --> 01:48:31,750
Oh no.

4179
01:48:32,270 --> 01:48:33,070
Holy fuck.

4180
01:48:33,670 --> 01:48:36,130
How come I've never seen that combo on our side?

4181
01:48:36,850 --> 01:48:37,470
We've done it.

4182
01:48:37,870 --> 01:48:39,150
I feel like...

4183
01:48:39,150 --> 01:48:39,590
Yeah.

4184
01:48:39,890 --> 01:48:39,950
I feel like...

4185
01:48:40,690 --> 01:48:42,410
I'm gonna hit it hard like twice.

4186
01:48:42,950 --> 01:48:44,690
I feel like I've never seen that before.

4187
01:48:45,070 --> 01:48:45,310
It's a hard combo.

4188
01:48:45,310 --> 01:48:46,550
It's really hard.

4189
01:48:46,630 --> 01:48:47,530
Oh, yeah, yeah.

4190
01:48:47,770 --> 01:48:48,290
I get it.

4191
01:48:48,370 --> 01:48:48,770
I get it.

4192
01:48:48,890 --> 01:48:50,050
It's a really hard combo to hit.

4193
01:48:50,490 --> 01:48:51,270
Are these touchable, guys?

4194
01:48:51,690 --> 01:48:52,090
Yeah.

4195
01:48:52,290 --> 01:48:52,610
Yeah, yeah.

4196
01:48:52,750 --> 01:48:53,270
It's 100%.

4197
01:48:55,990 --> 01:48:57,110
They're walling the other guys.

4198
01:48:58,110 --> 01:48:59,130
I think I'm cooked here.

4199
01:48:59,630 --> 01:49:00,290
I am dead here.

4200
01:49:00,810 --> 01:49:01,650
It was me or you.

4201
01:49:03,130 --> 01:49:03,950
I got one.

4202
01:49:03,990 --> 01:49:04,930
We're running this slowly.

4203
01:49:06,130 --> 01:49:07,910
Wait guys, I touched point and got their Jeff.

4204
01:49:08,570 --> 01:49:09,230
That's pretty good.

4205
01:49:09,690 --> 01:49:11,130
I'm gonna throw a bubble before I die.

4206
01:49:11,730 --> 01:49:12,770
Wait, don't see nine.

4207
01:49:13,110 --> 01:49:14,170
I'm gonna throw a bubble before I die.

4208
01:49:15,390 --> 01:49:16,890
I'm back on the...

4209
01:49:17,870 --> 01:49:18,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4210
01:49:19,770 --> 01:49:22,390
You got it, you got it, you got it.

4211
01:49:22,450 --> 01:49:23,190
Yeah, I got it, I got it.

4212
01:49:24,370 --> 01:49:25,770
Now I'm fully unleashed.

4213
01:49:26,070 --> 01:49:27,490
Alright, we're locking in now.

4214
01:49:27,870 --> 01:49:29,110
Five minute hold, I believe.

4215
01:49:30,370 --> 01:49:31,290
Yeah, you wanna try hard?

4216
01:49:31,410 --> 01:49:31,990
Let's go full try harder.

4217
01:49:39,640 --> 01:49:40,620
Put a bubble for you.

4218
01:49:40,620 --> 01:49:41,380
No blade, no blade, no blade man.

4219
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:42,200
Guys.

4220
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:48,500
Wait, uh, Groot's low.

4221
01:49:49,860 --> 01:49:51,660
Don't worry, I'm beat, I'm chopping this tree.

4222
01:49:51,660 --> 01:49:52,080
Yeah, beat him up.

4223
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:53,020
Nice.

4224
01:49:53,880 --> 01:49:54,960
You can ult first.

4225
01:49:57,840 --> 01:49:58,720
Bubble, healing bubble.

4226
01:49:59,240 --> 01:49:59,800
Oh, they're on hella.

4227
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:01,680
They've been on hella.

4228
01:50:04,680 --> 01:50:05,360
I'm gonna fade it.

4229
01:50:05,700 --> 01:50:07,180
Oh, big fade.

4230
01:50:07,460 --> 01:50:08,580
Oh, nice fade, nice fade.

4231
01:50:09,480 --> 01:50:10,580
Guys, I'm in it.

4232
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:11,400
I'm in it.

4233
01:50:11,460 --> 01:50:12,920
Oh, um, that's fine.

4234
01:50:12,920 --> 01:50:14,220
I'm in the thick of it, everybody knows.

4235
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:21,880
I died, I died through the- Oh, you died through it!

4236
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:24,000
Threw my, my full goop on the ground.

4237
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:25,560
I think you got hit by everything.

4238
01:50:25,960 --> 01:50:27,040
It's all good.

4239
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:28,540
I just get bursted.

4240
01:50:29,320 --> 01:50:30,620
It's okay, because I have ulti.

4241
01:50:31,260 --> 01:50:33,220
Yo, bugger, you say that, we do the combo thing.

4242
01:50:33,480 --> 01:50:35,260
Yeah, any second now, I just need to get there.

4243
01:50:36,060 --> 01:50:38,480
I'm kinda being, uh, held- I, yeah, there's a character here.

4244
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:41,380
The Jeff, the Jeff is terrorizing me.

4245
01:50:42,060 --> 01:50:43,920
Yeah, he's in Zimbabwe right now.

4246
01:50:44,100 --> 01:50:44,700
He's in Zimbabwe.

4247
01:50:44,780 --> 01:50:45,580
Yeah, we might need to ult.

4248
01:50:45,740 --> 01:50:47,760
I believe.

4249
01:50:48,540 --> 01:50:49,300
I got a Jeff.

4250
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:51,460
I think he's right here.

4251
01:50:51,700 --> 01:50:52,520
Look at that ult!

4252
01:50:52,820 --> 01:50:53,340
It's everyone!

4253
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:54,360
Yay!

4254
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:55,740
I want ult too!

4255
01:50:55,740 --> 01:50:55,760
I do!

4256
01:50:57,620 --> 01:50:58,480
I'm a flying lady!

4257
01:50:58,640 --> 01:50:58,940
It's okay.

4258
01:50:59,140 --> 01:51:00,320
If I didn't ult, we would have died to Hela.

4259
01:51:02,240 --> 01:51:02,600
Exactly.

4260
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:03,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4261
01:51:03,820 --> 01:51:04,240
They would've relved.

4262
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:04,500
They would've relved.

4263
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:04,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4264
01:51:04,780 --> 01:51:05,180
They would've relved.

4265
01:51:05,260 --> 01:51:05,600
Exactly.

4266
01:51:06,080 --> 01:51:06,260
That's smart.

4267
01:51:06,260 --> 01:51:07,940
We are stable and we're good.

4268
01:51:08,180 --> 01:51:08,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4269
01:51:09,120 --> 01:51:10,000
We can finally defend it.

4270
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:12,900
Wait, what?

4271
01:51:13,240 --> 01:51:14,640
He want two ulting lots.

4272
01:51:15,320 --> 01:51:17,160
I thought it was boombin.

4273
01:51:17,160 --> 01:51:17,340
What?

4274
01:51:17,680 --> 01:51:19,680
I think... Are you ulting your turtle?

4275
01:51:20,300 --> 01:51:21,500
That clone had it coming.

4276
01:51:21,660 --> 01:51:22,320
That clone had it coming.

4277
01:51:22,460 --> 01:51:23,800
This guy is ulting his demons.

4278
01:51:24,780 --> 01:51:25,920
Wait, there's a turtle behind him.

4279
01:51:26,020 --> 01:51:26,920
There's a turtle behind him.

4280
01:51:27,940 --> 01:51:29,280
Yeah, it's too much for me.

4281
01:51:29,700 --> 01:51:31,640
Oh my... Why can't I... Wait.

4282
01:51:32,240 --> 01:51:33,440
He is grounded now.

4283
01:51:34,620 --> 01:51:37,360
Maybe I should have saved my...

4284
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:38,860
Oh, that's a big one.

4285
01:51:40,040 --> 01:51:41,000
I got my one.

4286
01:51:41,740 --> 01:51:42,140
That's good.

4287
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:42,480
That's good.

4288
01:51:42,580 --> 01:51:42,860
That's actually good.

4289
01:51:43,500 --> 01:51:44,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4290
01:51:45,820 --> 01:51:46,600
Don't worry, Moxie.

4291
01:51:46,780 --> 01:51:48,000
I'll give you a...

4292
01:51:50,380 --> 01:51:51,260
I'll give you a shield.

4293
01:51:51,380 --> 01:51:52,800
It doesn't matter what you give me, I'm gonna die.

4294
01:51:53,620 --> 01:51:54,760
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

4295
01:51:54,900 --> 01:51:55,680
I'll give you a shield.

4296
01:51:56,220 --> 01:51:57,280
You'll live forever now.

4297
01:51:58,220 --> 01:51:59,300
Can I get a little bit of healing here?

4298
01:51:59,700 --> 01:52:00,020
Yeah.

4299
01:52:00,500 --> 01:52:00,800
I got it.

4300
01:52:02,220 --> 01:52:03,480
Is that inside of?

4301
01:52:08,120 --> 01:52:10,980
Oh my god, I didn't know Thor's ult was grounded now.

4302
01:52:11,060 --> 01:52:12,760
I thought my fucking game was lagging.

4303
01:52:13,420 --> 01:52:17,040
If he uses his E on you, which is like the little dome, and you walk out of it.

4304
01:52:17,260 --> 01:52:17,380
Oh, and...

4305
01:52:17,380 --> 01:52:18,000
Then you get grounded.

4306
01:52:18,440 --> 01:52:19,540
So you have to...

4307
01:52:19,540 --> 01:52:19,820
Stay in it.

4308
01:52:20,240 --> 01:52:21,980
Yeah, you have to cloak inside of it.

4309
01:52:21,980 --> 01:52:24,700
No, but you can still use dash abilities.

4310
01:52:24,980 --> 01:52:26,340
It's only for aerial abilities.

4311
01:52:27,040 --> 01:52:27,680
No, I can't.

4312
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:28,280
I can't fade.

4313
01:52:28,600 --> 01:52:29,380
Yeah, she can't fade.

4314
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:29,940
Oh, fade, yeah.

4315
01:52:30,100 --> 01:52:30,340
I'll fade, yeah.

4316
01:52:30,340 --> 01:52:30,620
I'll fade, yeah.

4317
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:31,080
I'll fade, yeah.

4318
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:32,480
I guess that's an aerial ability.

4319
01:52:32,900 --> 01:52:33,080
Yeah.

4320
01:52:34,020 --> 01:52:34,340
Cool!

4321
01:52:34,900 --> 01:52:35,700
I did not do that.

4322
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:39,160
Okay, now we can get out of this map, right?

4323
01:52:41,340 --> 01:52:43,080
We just have to swap sides.

4324
01:52:43,080 --> 01:52:44,120
Oh, true, true.

4325
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:45,500
Just swap sides.

4326
01:52:49,140 --> 01:52:51,520
Trevor, you didn't really do that much damage in this game.

4327
01:52:52,420 --> 01:52:52,620
Sorry.

4328
01:52:52,940 --> 01:52:53,500
I mean...

4329
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:55,400
Okay, to be fair, you are 7 and 10.

4330
01:52:56,420 --> 01:52:57,640
Mr. Twitch Rivals Champion.

4331
01:52:58,660 --> 01:52:59,460
7 and 11?

4332
01:52:59,620 --> 01:53:01,140
Twitch Rivals Champion?!

4333
01:53:01,140 --> 01:53:01,580
Whoa!

4334
01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:02,480
Yep, yep, yep.

4335
01:53:02,620 --> 01:53:02,880
Wow!

4336
01:53:04,240 --> 01:53:05,920
I love this map, guys.

4337
01:53:06,660 --> 01:53:07,420
At a good speed.

4338
01:53:08,040 --> 01:53:08,360
Midtown.

4339
01:53:09,160 --> 01:53:10,440
At a good speed.

4340
01:53:14,500 --> 01:53:14,820
It's okay.

4341
01:53:14,980 --> 01:53:15,400
There's a good place.

4342
01:53:15,460 --> 01:53:16,000
Put in your map, put in your map.

4343
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:18,360
Like, the children's need a new...

4344
01:53:18,360 --> 01:53:20,060
No, I can't, I can't, please stop, I can't stop.

4345
01:53:20,060 --> 01:53:20,940
Stop, I can't stop, I can't stop.

4346
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:22,580
Come on, ho ho ho ho.

4347
01:53:23,380 --> 01:53:26,300
It's okay, we know what to do now, we know what to do.

4348
01:53:34,480 --> 01:53:35,360
I can.

4349
01:53:35,740 --> 01:53:37,600
If I play this map again, I'm going to lose it.

4350
01:53:38,860 --> 01:53:40,080
I should just lose it.

4351
01:53:40,220 --> 01:53:41,440
We're getting rage bated.

4352
01:53:46,840 --> 01:53:47,860
I don't get it.

4353
01:53:48,020 --> 01:53:53,760
We did do two attack shirts for it.

4354
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:55,000
We did one defense.

4355
01:54:03,320 --> 01:54:04,580
Oh, that's not even a good draw.

4356
01:54:06,300 --> 01:54:07,340
Yeah, real funny.

4357
01:54:22,980 --> 01:54:24,420
Are you

4358
01:54:30,970 --> 01:54:33,770
gaslighting them?

4359
01:54:34,610 --> 01:54:34,910
Yeah.

4360
01:54:35,470 --> 01:54:35,550
Yeah.

4361
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:44,320
Wait, we're actually playing...

4362
01:54:44,320 --> 01:54:46,160
We're actually playing...

4363
01:54:49,900 --> 01:54:52,560
Why are we playing the map again?

4364
01:54:53,100 --> 01:54:53,840
I'm going to cry.

4365
01:54:54,060 --> 01:54:54,540
I'm going to cry.

4366
01:54:55,240 --> 01:54:57,920
We're going to be the party leading.

4367
01:54:58,500 --> 01:54:59,240
Can you surrender?

4368
01:54:59,460 --> 01:55:00,100
How do you surrender?

4369
01:55:00,100 --> 01:55:02,620
We have new characters, new map, new content.

4370
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:04,400
OK, there is no new map.

4371
01:55:04,500 --> 01:55:06,140
Okay, there is no new map.

4372
01:55:06,240 --> 01:55:21,440
There is no new map, there is not new map.

4373
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:22,060
Can we leave?

4374
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:23,000
Yeah, we can.

4375
01:55:23,800 --> 01:55:26,420
We can't surrender in custom lobby.

4376
01:55:26,540 --> 01:55:28,300
Yeah, we can't surrender till second half.

4377
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:30,240
No, we can't because it's not a competitive lobby.

4378
01:55:30,440 --> 01:55:30,900
It's a quick play lobby.

4379
01:55:30,900 --> 01:55:31,380
Yeah, it's a quick play.

4380
01:55:31,440 --> 01:55:33,100
We can't surrender in quick play.

4381
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:34,200
We will just leave.

4382
01:55:38,460 --> 01:55:39,520
Wait, this character sucks.

4383
01:55:39,720 --> 01:55:41,020
Are we actually playing this out?

4384
01:55:41,200 --> 01:55:46,080
I mean, Necro's is playing the map over and over again because it's the best flanker map in the game.

4385
01:55:46,260 --> 01:55:46,960
And he's just...

4386
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:48,700
You played the last game.

4387
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:50,740
We're getting TikTok ad farm.

4388
01:55:50,940 --> 01:55:51,120
Disgusting.

4389
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:54,020
We're going in his YouTube video.

4390
01:55:54,720 --> 01:55:56,640
I love being on a YouTube video.

4391
01:55:59,900 --> 01:56:01,120
Glad it's the sleepy air.

4392
01:56:03,480 --> 01:56:03,880
ZZZZZZ.

4393
01:56:07,440 --> 01:56:09,680
Wait, actually I want to play Adam.

4394
01:56:10,380 --> 01:56:11,160
Oh, that can kill me.

4395
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:12,220
You're halfway there.

4396
01:56:12,340 --> 01:56:12,980
Keep going.

4397
01:56:13,120 --> 01:56:13,960
Come on, I'll be on the right side.

4398
01:56:14,480 --> 01:56:15,240
There's a flake in tech.

4399
01:56:16,020 --> 01:56:16,200
Wait.

4400
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:16,620
Thor.

4401
01:56:16,940 --> 01:56:17,340
Dead.

4402
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:17,840
Main.

4403
01:56:18,300 --> 01:56:18,580
He's one.

4404
01:56:18,580 --> 01:56:20,200
I got him.

4405
01:56:20,300 --> 01:56:21,880
Look, guys, we're doing it.

4406
01:56:22,200 --> 01:56:25,380
Our fourth time on this map and we're doing it.

4407
01:56:26,340 --> 01:56:26,860
Woohoo!

4408
01:56:27,380 --> 01:56:27,900
Woohoo!

4409
01:56:31,600 --> 01:56:32,100
Woohoo!

4410
01:56:32,180 --> 01:56:33,320
I think it's my LG.

4411
01:56:36,280 --> 01:56:37,280
Just saying, just saying.

4412
01:56:37,280 --> 01:56:39,360
Do you not want to play this map the fifth time?

4413
01:56:40,720 --> 01:56:43,180
Oh, I'd love to, but...

4414
01:56:43,580 --> 01:56:44,540
I'm going to go to work on.

4415
01:56:44,740 --> 01:56:45,080
Tells me.

4416
01:56:47,680 --> 01:56:49,040
How did all of us die?

4417
01:56:50,120 --> 01:56:52,220
Uh, they shot and kind of died.

4418
01:56:52,500 --> 01:56:52,580
They used gun.

4419
01:56:53,460 --> 01:56:54,380
Yeah, they actually did use gun.

4420
01:56:55,060 --> 01:56:57,340
Uh, I'm learning it right now.

4421
01:56:57,720 --> 01:56:58,880
How did we lose that?

4422
01:56:59,460 --> 01:57:00,620
I just got my ult.

4423
01:57:00,840 --> 01:57:00,980
Oh, I got him.

4424
01:57:01,120 --> 01:57:02,480
Oh, they like double ulted.

4425
01:57:03,660 --> 01:57:04,740
Wait, where's our ult?

4426
01:57:04,740 --> 01:57:05,400
Oh, I got this.

4427
01:57:05,480 --> 01:57:06,720
Guys, I'm going to have 1v5.

4428
01:57:07,580 --> 01:57:08,160
You got this.

4429
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:10,920
How the fuck did their blade got up?

4430
01:57:11,780 --> 01:57:12,640
Oh, Moxie cooking.

4431
01:57:12,640 --> 01:57:13,060
They're not on a jet.

4432
01:57:13,540 --> 01:57:15,980
Wait, there's a sleeping Loki behind us.

4433
01:57:16,140 --> 01:57:16,180
Door, door, door.

4434
01:57:18,200 --> 01:57:18,800
I believe.

4435
01:57:19,220 --> 01:57:20,260
Get his ass, get his ass, focus.

4436
01:57:20,260 --> 01:57:21,560
There's a Loki behind us, though.

4437
01:57:21,560 --> 01:57:22,020
I'm chasing her, bro.

4438
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:23,260
Yay!

4439
01:57:23,820 --> 01:57:24,880
I almost went to the game, sorry.

4440
01:57:24,880 --> 01:57:25,140
Very nice, very nice.

4441
01:57:25,260 --> 01:57:25,980
We can stagger them a little bit.

4442
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:26,740
Stagger, stagger, stagger, stagger.

4443
01:57:27,780 --> 01:57:28,600
Loki's still here.

4444
01:57:29,580 --> 01:57:30,940
He's still invisible.

4445
01:57:31,160 --> 01:57:32,160
I'm going all the way in.

4446
01:57:32,160 --> 01:57:33,780
I'm waiting for you, Moxie.

4447
01:57:34,980 --> 01:57:35,020
Oh.

4448
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:36,260
Okay, wait, wait, you come out.

4449
01:57:36,320 --> 01:57:37,620
You come out, I'll save you.

4450
01:57:37,860 --> 01:57:38,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4451
01:57:38,920 --> 01:57:39,340
They won't know.

4452
01:57:39,600 --> 01:57:40,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4453
01:57:40,240 --> 01:57:40,900
Stand right here, right here.

4454
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:41,540
He's asleep, he's asleep.

4455
01:57:41,960 --> 01:57:42,800
That's good, that's good.

4456
01:57:46,900 --> 01:57:50,180
Tech, you didn't expect another invisible Loki.

4457
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:51,400
It's fine.

4458
01:57:52,040 --> 01:57:52,500
We're fine.

4459
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:54,660
Are you okay?

4460
01:57:55,720 --> 01:57:57,260
No, no, no, no!

4461
01:57:57,940 --> 01:57:59,640
I got my ult, I got my ult, I got my ult.

4462
01:57:59,820 --> 01:58:00,500
I got my ult.

4463
01:58:00,500 --> 01:58:01,320
Whenever you're ready.

4464
01:58:02,100 --> 01:58:02,500
I'm ready, whatever.

4465
01:58:03,460 --> 01:58:04,760
Why did you run out?

4466
01:58:05,440 --> 01:58:06,700
I was trying to get the healing.

4467
01:58:08,960 --> 01:58:11,560
Yeah, there was four people in front of me.

4468
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:13,920
I see one.

4469
01:58:14,820 --> 01:58:15,260
Thornton!

4470
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:16,980
Nice.

4471
01:58:17,320 --> 01:58:17,820
Oh, you!

4472
01:58:18,200 --> 01:58:18,660
That's it!

4473
01:58:19,140 --> 01:58:19,240
You, General.

4474
01:58:19,780 --> 01:58:21,220
Star, Star Lord behind us?

4475
01:58:21,780 --> 01:58:22,860
I believe you're four.

4476
01:58:23,220 --> 01:58:23,500
Thanks.

4477
01:58:23,500 --> 01:58:24,420
I got him.

4478
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:26,180
He's one.

4479
01:58:26,740 --> 01:58:27,400
He's dead.

4480
01:58:28,060 --> 01:58:31,600
See guys, it only took us four tries to know how to play this map.

4481
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:33,060
There's someone behind us.

4482
01:58:33,300 --> 01:58:34,460
I think it's a Loki.

4483
01:58:34,640 --> 01:58:36,180
He's been trying to invis blink.

4484
01:58:37,140 --> 01:58:37,960
Good, good.

4485
01:58:40,840 --> 01:58:42,740
That was a sick 1v1 right there.

4486
01:58:44,460 --> 01:58:45,840
You did cheat a little bit.

4487
01:58:45,980 --> 01:58:47,080
I healed you.

4488
01:58:47,480 --> 01:58:48,120
Let's go ahead.

4489
01:58:48,180 --> 01:58:48,660
Let's go ahead.

4490
01:58:48,740 --> 01:58:49,220
I'm going to copy.

4491
01:58:49,320 --> 01:58:49,780
I'm going to copy.

4492
01:58:50,680 --> 01:58:51,060
Massive.

4493
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:53,040
Bring on the chaos.

4494
01:58:53,100 --> 01:58:53,320
Nice.

4495
01:58:53,320 --> 01:58:53,340
Nice.

4496
01:58:53,460 --> 01:58:55,020
Okay, well, nevermind.

4497
01:58:55,140 --> 01:58:56,040
Surefour is just cheating.

4498
01:58:56,300 --> 01:58:56,460
I'm on foot.

4499
01:58:57,200 --> 01:58:57,680
I'm just...

4500
01:58:59,560 --> 01:59:02,600
I'm just pressing the buttons.

4501
01:59:03,360 --> 01:59:04,660
He's just clicking heads, you know?

4502
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:05,780
What's going on over there?

4503
01:59:05,980 --> 01:59:06,440
Did you copy?

4504
01:59:06,440 --> 01:59:07,500
Mostly the body shots, actually.

4505
01:59:07,620 --> 01:59:07,720
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.

4506
01:59:07,940 --> 01:59:10,080
I was making a play and then Surefour killed that.

4507
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:10,840
That's a good...

4508
01:59:11,260 --> 01:59:12,100
That's a good...

4509
01:59:12,100 --> 01:59:12,620
Nice one.

4510
01:59:13,060 --> 01:59:13,680
He's walling speed.

4511
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:14,160
Oh!

4512
01:59:15,280 --> 01:59:15,860
Holy shit.

4513
01:59:15,960 --> 01:59:16,680
He's walling speed up.

4514
01:59:17,520 --> 01:59:17,980
Holy shit.

4515
01:59:18,320 --> 01:59:18,360
It's fine.

4516
01:59:18,360 --> 01:59:19,120
Oh, it's not fine.

4517
01:59:19,320 --> 01:59:19,880
It's not fine.

4518
01:59:20,700 --> 01:59:22,620
He massively healed after the ult.

4519
01:59:22,640 --> 01:59:23,220
Alright, escort me out, please.

4520
01:59:24,700 --> 01:59:26,100
Um, I...

4521
01:59:26,100 --> 01:59:28,060
That's all the seeds I can give.

4522
01:59:28,340 --> 01:59:28,520
Yeah, yeah.

4523
01:59:28,580 --> 01:59:29,580
All the more leaves, no problem.

4524
01:59:30,160 --> 01:59:30,780
I ran out.

4525
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:31,580
I'm a little bit stealing here.

4526
01:59:31,980 --> 01:59:33,220
Can you get rid of the snowflake?

4527
01:59:34,060 --> 01:59:34,960
Yeah, one second.

4528
01:59:36,460 --> 01:59:36,920
Are you eating?

4529
01:59:37,120 --> 01:59:37,200
Okay.

4530
01:59:38,380 --> 01:59:38,680
Maybe.

4531
01:59:38,840 --> 01:59:39,120
She's hungry.

4532
01:59:40,280 --> 01:59:41,060
Let me help.

4533
01:59:41,340 --> 01:59:42,280
Let a girl eat.

4534
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:44,800
Yeah, you want her to starve?

4535
01:59:45,100 --> 01:59:45,780
That's fucked up.

4536
01:59:46,020 --> 01:59:46,500
Oh, she ate.

4537
01:59:47,660 --> 01:59:48,760
Oh, how many of the others ate?

4538
01:59:48,840 --> 01:59:49,640
She's eating.

4539
01:59:50,480 --> 01:59:51,480
Oh, you're so dead.

4540
01:59:51,600 --> 01:59:51,880
Let's fuck it, let's fuck it.

4541
01:59:51,980 --> 01:59:52,760
I've ult in five seconds.

4542
01:59:54,320 --> 01:59:56,320
Hold on, the rocket's gonna get assassinated here.

4543
01:59:58,080 --> 01:59:59,640
Holy fuck, I almost got one shot.

4544
02:00:01,020 --> 02:00:02,020
We can still win this, we can still win this.

4545
02:00:02,360 --> 02:00:03,000
I believe.

4546
02:00:03,920 --> 02:00:07,000
Four, three, two, one, zero.

4547
02:00:07,900 --> 02:00:08,880
I'm waiting for AC to see who...

4548
02:00:09,420 --> 02:00:09,980
And then...

4549
02:00:09,980 --> 02:00:10,940
Oh wait, I don't have ult yet.

4550
02:00:11,140 --> 02:00:11,420
Thanks.

4551
02:00:12,360 --> 02:00:13,720
Okay, I'm gonna ult right here, guys.

4552
02:00:14,520 --> 02:00:15,060
Let's go.

4553
02:00:15,300 --> 02:00:15,420
Let's go.

4554
02:00:17,800 --> 02:00:18,080
Nice.

4555
02:00:18,300 --> 02:00:18,880
We're in mind, by the way.

4556
02:00:19,300 --> 02:00:20,280
He's low, we're in mind, low.

4557
02:00:20,460 --> 02:00:20,620
We're in mind, low.

4558
02:00:20,620 --> 02:00:20,880
We're in mind, low.

4559
02:00:20,900 --> 02:00:21,700
We're behind, low?

4560
02:00:21,920 --> 02:00:22,320
Oh, I'm here.

4561
02:00:22,580 --> 02:00:23,220
Go, go, go.

4562
02:00:23,220 --> 02:00:23,360
Shit.

4563
02:00:23,640 --> 02:00:24,440
What the fuck?

4564
02:00:24,440 --> 02:00:25,480
What is he doing here?

4565
02:00:25,880 --> 02:00:26,740
Very nice.

4566
02:00:27,420 --> 02:00:28,380
Okay, that's it.

4567
02:00:28,660 --> 02:00:29,660
Last combo we're using here.

4568
02:00:29,920 --> 02:00:30,880
Yeah, super combo.

4569
02:00:31,140 --> 02:00:32,340
Oh my god, we're finally doing a combo?

4570
02:00:33,080 --> 02:00:34,540
Oh, we already did it before this.

4571
02:00:34,640 --> 02:00:35,000
Oh my god.

4572
02:00:36,320 --> 02:00:39,080
Yeah, I got this.

4573
02:00:39,480 --> 02:00:40,180
I'm set up, I'm set up.

4574
02:00:40,320 --> 02:00:41,600
Oh my god, we're doing it.

4575
02:00:42,700 --> 02:00:44,980
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

4576
02:00:44,980 --> 02:00:46,020
Wait, wait, waiting, waiting.

4577
02:00:46,180 --> 02:00:46,300
Now.

4578
02:00:51,740 --> 02:00:52,640
Are you okay?

4579
02:00:54,020 --> 02:00:54,580
I think.

4580
02:00:56,520 --> 02:00:57,880
Oh my god, we're doing it again.

4581
02:00:58,020 --> 02:00:58,580
Get him, get him, sure, bro.

4582
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:00,380
Wait, me?

4583
02:01:00,380 --> 02:01:01,120
You already got him, yeah.

4584
02:01:01,360 --> 02:01:02,440
Oh, never mind, that's poker.

4585
02:01:12,060 --> 02:01:14,600
It only took us four maps to figure it out.

4586
02:01:15,200 --> 02:01:15,920
Oh wow.

4587
02:01:15,920 --> 02:01:16,540
Just put me on Blabe.

4588
02:01:16,760 --> 02:01:18,420
Yeah, just put me on Loki.

4589
02:01:19,180 --> 02:01:20,280
Loki, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4590
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:21,340
Loki on Loki?

4591
02:01:22,140 --> 02:01:22,980
Loki goated.

4592
02:01:24,020 --> 02:01:26,000
Dude, right on cue.

4593
02:01:27,480 --> 02:01:27,720
Beautiful.

4594
02:01:27,880 --> 02:01:29,180
Well, that was my LG.

4595
02:01:31,460 --> 02:01:33,100
Are you coming for scrims?

4596
02:01:33,800 --> 02:01:34,780
Yeah, we have scrims later.

4597
02:01:34,980 --> 02:01:35,560
No, I have more.

4598
02:01:35,600 --> 02:01:36,600
Are we going to do VOD reviews?

4599
02:01:37,200 --> 02:01:38,200
We can do VOD reviews.

4600
02:01:38,340 --> 02:01:38,580
Yeah.

4601
02:01:39,080 --> 02:01:40,940
Just send me the VOD review.

4602
02:01:41,540 --> 02:01:42,500
All right, I got you.

4603
02:01:42,920 --> 02:01:43,380
Thank you, guys.

4604
02:01:43,900 --> 02:01:44,240
Yeah, GG.

4605
02:01:44,760 --> 02:01:45,160
Bye.

4606
02:01:45,400 --> 02:01:45,700
Bye, guys.

4607
02:01:46,440 --> 02:01:46,520
Bye.

4608
02:01:46,820 --> 02:01:47,440
Nice to see you, guys.

4609
02:01:47,660 --> 02:01:47,700
Bye.

4610
02:01:47,760 --> 02:01:48,100
Yeah.

4611
02:01:48,360 --> 02:01:48,680
Bye bye.

4612
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:49,180
Bye bye.

4613
02:01:49,340 --> 02:01:49,420
Bye bye.

4614
02:01:49,420 --> 02:01:49,840
Have a good stream.

4615
02:01:50,060 --> 02:01:50,100
Bye.

4616
02:02:23,380 --> 02:02:24,180
Bye bye.

4617
02:02:24,180 --> 02:02:25,140
For me, for me, that is.

4618
02:02:25,320 --> 02:02:29,820
I decided to do Mantis just because I was like, oh, give XQC the team up for it.

4619
02:02:31,060 --> 02:02:32,180
I like this new map.

4620
02:02:32,280 --> 02:02:33,060
Oh, you mean Midtown?

4621
02:02:33,540 --> 02:02:35,680
Yeah, I mean Midtown.

4622
02:02:36,700 --> 02:02:38,880
After playing Midtown four times.

4623
02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:41,220
Wow, I love the new map.

4624
02:02:43,940 --> 02:02:45,340
I had a great time.

4625
02:02:45,520 --> 02:02:47,240
I hope you guys had a good time, too.

4626
02:02:47,920 --> 02:02:51,360
It was cool to try out all the new team ups and everything.

4627
02:02:52,240 --> 02:02:52,980
My opinion.

4628
02:02:53,300 --> 02:02:53,800
I think, like...

4629
02:02:53,800 --> 02:02:55,680
I mean, Luna's pretty good with her.

4630
02:02:55,820 --> 02:02:58,860
That Loki buff is insane, though.

4631
02:02:59,400 --> 02:03:04,880
Okay, Loki is actually so fucking good with his new buff and everything.

4632
02:03:04,880 --> 02:03:07,340
The fucking Venn diagram that I can make.

4633
02:03:11,320 --> 02:03:14,780
I just felt like I was basically, like...

4634
02:03:14,780 --> 02:03:17,020
I felt like I could live forever, yeah.

4635
02:03:17,720 --> 02:03:24,960
Especially, like, the damage boost and everything with the lamps, too, if I could have that.

4636
02:03:25,700 --> 02:03:40,040
Yeah, he was already really broken, because in high elo, they tend to ban Loki first and everything.

4637
02:03:41,120 --> 02:03:45,940
So, it is a problem, but Loki is already, like, main priority ban anyway.

4638
02:03:46,320 --> 02:03:48,080
But it was fun getting back into Rivals.

4639
02:03:48,180 --> 02:03:52,720
I actually haven't played Rivals in, I think, like, a few months now.

4640
02:03:52,720 --> 02:03:55,180
I haven't... I haven't played the new season.

4641
02:03:55,320 --> 02:03:59,740
I have played a little bit of the new season, but I didn't play a lot.

4642
02:04:00,060 --> 02:04:03,740
So, I didn't get a chance to warm up, too, before this sponsor.

4643
02:04:04,020 --> 02:04:05,640
But I did enjoy it a lot.

4644
02:04:06,540 --> 02:04:07,700
Yeah, a few months.

4645
02:04:07,740 --> 02:04:08,580
Yeah, I've been so busy.

4646
02:04:08,820 --> 02:04:10,760
I've played, like, here and there, off stream.

4647
02:04:10,960 --> 02:04:12,840
Like, maybe, like, one to two games off stream.

4648
02:04:14,620 --> 02:04:20,100
But, so I was, like, trying to remember how to aim and stuff while we were playing the game.

4649
02:04:20,560 --> 02:04:21,700
But it was really fun with the team.

4650
02:04:21,700 --> 02:04:22,660
I really liked the team.

4651
02:04:22,880 --> 02:04:25,080
Um, we were obviously all fucking around.

4652
02:04:26,920 --> 02:04:32,520
We were all, like, fucking around and, you know, like, moving around everywhere.

4653
02:04:32,840 --> 02:04:35,660
And just, like, you know, trolling with our picks and everything.

4654
02:04:36,060 --> 02:04:37,680
Uh, so it was really fun.

4655
02:04:37,700 --> 02:04:39,960
And then we're doing, like, dumb plans and everything.

4656
02:04:40,180 --> 02:04:41,240
Like, the banter was nice.

4657
02:04:41,320 --> 02:04:42,260
I liked it.

4658
02:04:42,520 --> 02:04:44,540
Uh, I really enjoyed playing with them.

4659
02:04:44,540 --> 02:04:47,140
Um, yeah, I got MVP.

4660
02:04:47,560 --> 02:04:48,020
I did.

4661
02:04:48,400 --> 02:04:51,420
Yeah, our team was definitely not the try-hard team for sure.

4662
02:04:53,080 --> 02:04:55,840
We were, our team was the fuck-around team.

4663
02:04:56,060 --> 02:04:57,460
We were, we were just fucking around.

4664
02:04:57,460 --> 02:04:59,600
Yeah, like, like, Boger is playing Spider-Man.

4665
02:05:00,100 --> 02:05:01,780
XQC was playing Blade.

4666
02:05:05,540 --> 02:05:08,800
Um, wait, were the, was the other team, like, really quiet?

4667
02:05:09,160 --> 02:05:12,160
I was surprised, because they were, they seemed really try-hard.

4668
02:05:14,180 --> 02:05:16,240
They seemed, were they actually really quiet?

4669
02:05:16,380 --> 02:05:18,740
I thought they were calming a little bit, honestly.

4670
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:24,220
Because, uh, um, they, I thought they were calming, because they were trying so hard.

4671
02:05:25,080 --> 02:05:28,000
We were like, what the fuck, why are they on their memes?

4672
02:05:30,320 --> 02:05:33,280
They needed the, they need, guys, you don't understand.

4673
02:05:33,880 --> 02:05:37,760
Um, they needed the, they needed the YouTube ad revenue, guys.

4674
02:05:37,960 --> 02:05:40,440
God, we were, they just wanted to clip farm us.

4675
02:05:40,880 --> 02:05:43,540
Uh, yeah, we were the content team.

4676
02:05:43,640 --> 02:05:44,760
But it was a fun content.

4677
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:46,020
It was really fun.

4678
02:05:46,500 --> 02:05:51,400
Um, um, because the matches we lost were just us fucking around.

4679
02:05:51,560 --> 02:05:54,660
And they were still, the matches we lost were just us fucking around.

4680
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:56,440
But it was still super close.

4681
02:05:56,620 --> 02:05:59,260
Even though, even though, like, we were fucking around.

4682
02:05:59,460 --> 02:06:00,500
So, I thought that was good.

4683
02:06:00,940 --> 02:06:06,120
Um, beating XQC and the VTuber.

4684
02:06:08,680 --> 02:06:11,060
Beating, beating XOWLPros.

4685
02:06:13,880 --> 02:06:14,780
Hello, guys.

4686
02:06:15,140 --> 02:06:20,200
I think it was, it might have been a mistake to give the best flanker players midtown, maybe.

4687
02:06:21,640 --> 02:06:31,960
Maybe, like, I feel like necros selected the best flanker maps, as in the new cough and midtown, which were both the best flanker maps.

4688
02:06:32,300 --> 02:06:33,720
Like, of course he would.

4689
02:06:34,060 --> 02:06:34,360
Oh, great.

4690
02:06:34,460 --> 02:06:36,280
At least he didn't play Spider-Man.

4691
02:06:36,420 --> 02:06:38,920
Because I heard the Spider-Man ult also got buffed, too.

4692
02:06:39,420 --> 02:06:40,720
Um, but I had a great time.

4693
02:06:41,020 --> 02:06:46,840
Uh, I hope you guys, uh, check out, uh, click on the link, um, that's pinned in my chat.

If you, stay up for me, stay up for a little longer, because I'm gonna stream on YouTube.

4715
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:52,920
Or head to bed.

As always, everybody, I'll see you guys next time.

4717

Bye!
