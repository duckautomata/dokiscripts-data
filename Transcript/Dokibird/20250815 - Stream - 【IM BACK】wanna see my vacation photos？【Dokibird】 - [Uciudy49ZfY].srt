00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:16,040
Anyway, so what happened was that, you know, during the middle of, like, you know, we were up in the air.

53
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,940
And then the captain was like, I'll reread what I tweeted.

54
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,120

55
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,080
You guys, I...

56
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,000
I was so fucking scared.

57
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,460
He was like, Uh, hello, this is the captain speaking.

58
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,420
A volcano just erupted in our path, and we have to rewrite our flight right now with air traffic control.

59
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,320
So, there will be a slight delay.

60
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,580
While we were in the air.

61
00:09:46,580 --> 00:11:23,360
I know I'm just like What Wait I've been I'll just see you guys you know I've been on planes for A majority of my life I've been traveling you know back Like I've been traveling on planes For the majority of my life Because my parents love traveling And you know sometimes I have to fly back to Asia a lot To growing up to visit relatives this and i've never in my life um had the pilot be like a fucking volcano erupted and we have to reroute while we were flying while we were in the air and then in my head i was like oh please don't crash into another plane i was just like because we're rerouting in the middle our flight so i'm just like oh please don't accidentally get into another plane's fucking round i was like like i had so much fear i i was like please don't make my story into a final destination movie please i do not want to be on mayday i i was like i do not consent to be on like clips of my like beats are like um famous vtuber uh dokeybird was also on that plane and then they

64
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,520
I don't know how that has happened.

65
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,400
Anyway, so we landed safely.

66
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,280
I'm here streaming right now.

67
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,980
So, I guess that you all know that I survived.

68
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:35,920
Thank God.

69
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:41,180
But, so I thought that was it, you know.

70
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,740
I thought that was where, like, my bad luck ends.

71
00:12:46,580 --> 00:13:46,780
life is so cruel sometimes uh like like decided to to play a cruel joke on me because it was not over because uh i was like you know it was late at night like um for dinner you know i was just like the on the day i got back on the day i got like got back i was like you know what i feel like eating some pho today so I ordered pho and I was like yum yum yum and then you know you know I have a bowl of soup that had to pour out you know so um later in that you know I just kept it on the I just kept it in sync for now and then like later later on I was just like okay I'll clean it later after before I head to bed and then you know I went to bed at like around like I think like 3 to 4 Yeah,

72
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,180
I should I pour my foa into the sink.

73
00:13:49,800 --> 00:14:03,740
So, you know, um, so you know, it wasn't it wasn't like it was a lot of noodles or anything and I've I need you guys to know this I rarely ever pour anything into the kitchen sink ever it's always been like Um, because like, uh, I've never really eaten.

74
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:18,220
I've never eaten takeout when it comes with soup stuff Because um, I never like because you know, usually I never order takeout with soup with like like, you know, like compared to eating there at the restaurant.

75
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,440
Today, I was just like, you know what?

76
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,340
I'm going to get some fau today.

77
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:31,660
And so I poured the fau down the sink.

78
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,620
And it was just a little bit of, it was a little out of noodles.

79
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,840
It was just a little bit of noodles.

80
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,560
I have a garbage disposal.

81
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,200
I have a garbage disposal.

82
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,060
Just so you guys know.

83
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,900
And then It got clogged.

84
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,880
It got clogged.

85
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,160
I've never done this before.

86
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,180
The very first time I ever thrown...

87
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:04,060
Dumped my pub and down the kitchen sink.

88
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,940
It got clogged.

89
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,360
And I was like, oh, don't worry.

90
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,860
I have a garbage disposal.

91
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,480
So I pressed the button.

92
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,820
But then nothing happened.

93
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,220
And I was like, Why did not go brr?

94
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,560
Where's the sound?

95
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,300
Where's the churning sound?

96
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:35,100
And I looked at, I was like, and I was like, okay, where's my instruction manual?

97
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,540
I found an instruction manual.

98
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,380
It said it was like, there's a reset button just in case.

99
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,360
There's a reset button on your garbage disposal.

100
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,800
I was like, oh, okay.

101
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,220
And then I pressed it.

102
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,580
I was like, okay, it'll be fixed, right?

103
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,900
And it was like...

104
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,140
It didn't make any sound.

105
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,000
It didn't make any sound.

106
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,680
It just did...

107
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,520
And then it stopped.

108
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,940
And I'm like...

109
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:56,960
No.

110
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:01,320
No.

111
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:02,600
No.

112
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:04,820
No.

113
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,100
And I was like...

114
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:16,640
Can noodles jog garbage disposal?

115
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:45,760
And that was And that's when I find out I thought it would cut I didn't realize it could cut What's the point of having A garbage disposal If it It clogs It can clog it What's the point What I don't understand

116
00:16:50,700 --> 00:17:19,000
Didn't understand I've never done this before i didn't know i was like i thought because like garbage disposal it fucking disposed garbage and like i'm like this is garbage like i was like this is garbage well anyway so now i need to call the plumber i haven't called a plumber yet because it's it's not like fully clogged because Like,

117
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:24,440
after, you know, after I find out that, okay, now I know that soft foods can jam it.

118
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,440
Now I know, guys.

119
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,020
Now, I know.

120
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,680
I didn't know.

121
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,640
But now I know, okay, I didn't know.

122
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:45,040
Anyway, so it wasn't like, okay, so I found out it wasn't fully clagged because, you know, it was four in the morning.

123
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,180
And then I was just like, I'm going to head to bed.

124
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,360
I was like, I was like, okay.

125
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,980
Well, it's clogged.

126
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:59,100
And there's, you know, it's just soup base in the sink now because it's not going to go down.

127
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,480
And I was like, it's four in the morning.

128
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,320
I'll call the plumber tomorrow.

129
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,760
So then I, like later in the morning.

130
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,500
So then I, because I was like, it's four in the morning.

131
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,040
I'm fucking, I'm tired and stressed, okay?

132
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,480
I survive a volcanic eruption.

133
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,160
I, I don't want to, I didn't want to deal with this.

134
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,620
So, so.

135
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,020
I was just like, okay, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna go sleep.

136
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,100
I'm gonna go asleep.

137
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:30,700
And then I wake up, I go to the sink, and I was like, oh, hey, it's God.

138
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:37,660
You know, like, I was like, oh, hey, look, all the soup's God.

139
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:44,200
So I'm like, oh, it's not fully clogged, you know, I think there's a tiny hole in there in that clogged.

140
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:51,480
No, it wasn't magically fixed because if I put too much water there, it stops draining.

141
00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:04,760
So, so I was just like, all right, as long as I, all right, I was like, okay, thinking like, all right, I don't really use the kitchen sink that much anyway because I use, eat like pre-cooked meals.

142
00:19:05,280 --> 00:20:07,480
So I'm just thinking, like, as long as I don't order any soup pans, I was just like, okay I was like I don't need to call a plumber right away because at least like you know at least there's a tiny hole in there so water can go down so I was like okay I'll call plumber later like when I have time because I was just like I was thinking like okay it's water is still draining you know what do not let it rest please okay I will call plumbers soon just maybe tomorrow I'll do it tomorrow I'll do it tomorrow so uh because like I did think about maybe buying a plunger but then I'm like no I could make it worse like with my luck right now I might make it worse and I was like I don't know if I want to play with that,

143
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,580
like, fate right now.

144
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,580
I don't know.

145
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:15,570
Because I thought about it.

146
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:17,630
I was like, I don't have a plunger.

147
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:22,190
I have, like, the other one, the scrappy one, but I don't have a plunger.

148
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:27,450
So I'm just, I was thinking, like, I could do it myself, yes.

149
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:35,430
But, like, that's, you're asking the person that just fucking clogged her kitchen sink because she thought the garbage disposal was meant to dispose garbage.

150
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:38,890
that you're not supposed to...

151
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:42,570
You're talking to a girl that poured noodles into your kitchen sink, guys.

152
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:44,890
And apparently you're not supposed to do that.

153
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:51,130
So I'm like, I don't think I should do it myself.

154
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,730
I don't think so.

155
00:20:55,890 --> 00:21:00,450
So I will call plumber tomorrow.

156
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,070
Maybe not today.

157
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,290
Not tomorrow.

158
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:04,370
I'll do it tomorrow.

159
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,430
Simple matter.

160
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:08,490
Thank you for the super chat.

161
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:08,910
Thank you.

162
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:11,830
Thank you Do you need a cough Thumper?

163
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:22,690
It will start to sink Well the best, the good thing is that Like my nose is not very good at smelling things So like I won't notice It until like maybe if it Gets really bad I

164
00:21:26,950 --> 00:22:07,230
But I will do it tomorrow guys Anyway Anyway I will do it Guys I'll do it tomorrow I promise You guys I that's not good thing it's okay dad's at the dog sitter too so like he's it's okay he's at the dog sitter still um i'm picking him up on saturday the reason why he's not back yet is because like oh he's so fucking spoiled by the way at the dog sitter i'm getting like i get like video and picture updates and he's so fucking spoiled um but the reason why is like i'm still sick and i figured like you know let him have a couple of days you know with the dog sitter before he comes back home i don't even know if he still recognizes me as home anymore

165
00:22:10,750 --> 00:23:27,610
but that's why I'm giving him a few more days until he comes back anyway so so I had that happened to me um and then and then after that the next day okay well the reason why the next day I also didn't call a plumber because I had to do a lot deal with a lot of stuff too which was yesterday uh this happened yesterday and um basically what happened yesterday was that so I have like pre-cooked meals um delivered to my place um and you know I had to set up so that you know when I come back from um my when I come back from my vacation I can start eating my pre-cooked meals the day after so they deliver they were going to deliver it yesterday and then I was like um you know I was incredibly jet lagged and so I when I woke up they're like oh it's delivered and I was like that's weird usually have to call me so they can be let in to deliver to my apartment so I was like hmm that's weird and then so um I called I called the um support and they're like oh um we have a they sent us a photo of it

166
00:23:27,610 --> 00:24:01,570
and now it's like they're like is this your is this your apartment door and I looked at it and I saw the apartment number was correct but it was not like my door because like because I have neighbors and it showed that like I had a neighbor like beside me so but the door didn't exist it was just a wall and I was like that's weird and the thing is uh my building it has a neighbor building um it has a neighbor building so they deliver it to the building next door

167
00:24:04,650 --> 00:25:27,890
how because it's never happened before they actually delivered it to the to the building next door and then they just yeah they just left it there and then i like i keep the most fucked up part is that i can't access the floor because like you need the key to access your floor which is why um okay so like uh which is why i feel like it's super safe because like you can't access the floor like even if you're like if you're living on like a different floor uh you can't press other people's floors uh because your key your fob is linked to your specific floor so um so obviously i can't even access the building floor the other different building floor so i have to go to the lobby to the concierge and be like hi um um they your building and like gave it to like the wrong like to the like gave it to this floor number can you like go check for me if it's still there and acacia checked and then she came back down and she's like it's not there so so like they took my pre-cooked meals i was like

168
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:30,610
i was like that's so up.

169
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:34,190
I was like, what do you I was like, bro, that's fucked up.

171
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:40,890

I'm glad to hear it was at least enjoyable.

202
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,210
Also, it was my birthday two days ago.

203
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:48,090
Can I get a happy birthday?

204
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:49,590
Of course you can, Croesus.

Happy birthday to you.

00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,450
Happy birthday to you.

207
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,930
Happy birthday, dear Lord Croesus.

208
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:58,210
Happy birthday to you.

209
00:29:58,370 --> 00:29:59,570
Yeah, happy birthday.

210
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:05,890
Anyway, what was I going to say?

211
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:06,210
Oh, yeah.

212
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:11,550
But I accepted the Marvel Rivals invite super duper last minute.

213
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:14,590
Literally, like, two days before I was supposed to travel.

214
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,410
I was like, okay, I'm going to do it.

215
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:17,850
Because at first I didn't want to.

216
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,890
You know, like, my paranoia and shit like that.

217
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:24,190
Like, I was like, oh, you know, and also, like, traveling as well.

218
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:27,190
Traveling overseas for long distances.

219
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:29,470
So I was like, oh, do I do it?

220
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:30,770
And I was, like, impulsively.

221
00:30:30,770 --> 00:31:24,170
guys you know what i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do it when am i gonna this is like their first land um it's it's their very first land like um so it should be like the experience that you should you should take um because they're trying to you know it's also like by the way um the only people they never they didn't sold any tickets to to watch this land too by the way um because the only way to actually be there at the actual land itself um it's either you're a staff member or like you know family and friends of the players or like invited guests by um um by the the rivals team so they didn't sold any tickets to the public so these were the only ways you could actually like watch the land itself so that's why I was like you know I was like okay I should take try like you know,

222
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:27,830
take this experience, and why I said yes in the end.

223
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:34,570
Because like, they asked me like, you know, I remember I told you guys when they invited me, I was like, oh, I'm still thinking about it.

224
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:38,530
And I remember on that stream, I was like, oh, yeah, no, I'm not going to go.

225
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:44,570
But then like literally two days before before I flat before I flew, I was like, you know what?

226
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:45,030
Fuck it.

227
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,450
I'm going to do it.

228
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,850
Because it was such a cool opportunity in general.

229
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,770
And like I knew I wasn't going to experience something like that.

230
00:31:53,770 --> 00:33:18,650
again you know because i think the next land i believe the next land it's gonna be like a public thing so like you know um it's gonna have um i mean the next land is the million dollar land too so like i i'm like i'm not sure if i'm gonna go there i mean it's a million dollar land like that's just crazy dollar land but i did find out i did tell you guys um um on the last stream i was like oh i go into this land made me realize i'm not a land person in general yeah i um it made me realize that i'm not really a land person because like i don't know i think i just like playing video games more than watching like esports i think i think i think that's it i just like playing video games more than watching esports um because like uh oh my god okay so during the finals don't worry guys i have a lot of photos and videos to show you guys too later but during the finals oh my god so the finals is um best of i think it was like best of seven or some shit and the thing about the finals was um was

231
00:33:18,650 --> 00:34:20,610
it was so long because it was best of seven so i was like i i i went to the finals because i was like oh it's the last you know um it's the it's the last game you know it's first it's the first versus second and then so i was like okay i have to watch that so i have to watch it so i was just like all right and then i watched i thought it would be a huge stomp on one end a huge stomp from was it rad esports i esports where uh uh where like they've been um winning almost every game and i thought it'd be a huge stomp because they stomped envy who was like um the other team like they three owed them and i thought it was gonna be you know best of five not best of fucking seven so i was like oh it's gonna be another three oh but then but then you know i was like okay rad won one and then but then No.

232
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:36,290
Because I asked, like, I asked, like, the staff and, like, one of my friends, and they're like, yeah, I think there's going to be a back and forth.

233
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:41,010
And because it's going to be a back and forth, it might be four, it's going to be, like, three to four hours.

234
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:57,650
So, I was just like, holy fuck, I was like, okay, I am not gonna be sitting here for three to four hours.

235
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:58,490
I'm sorry.

236
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,430
Like, I'm so sorry.

237
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:03,790
Like, I know who I am as a person.

238
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:12,550
So, what I did was that, I was like, I was like, I'm sorry.

239
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:17,970
Sorry, I cannot sit there for three to four hours now.

240
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:32,090
So what I did was I like, like I told like one of the staff, I was like, okay, I'm gonna go back to the hotel room.

241
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:40,770
And you text me, you text me when there's one game.

242
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:47,830
When there's like one to two games left, you texted me.

243
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:51,470
And then I went back to the hotel room.

244
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:54,750
I took a nap.

245
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:57,790
I literally took an hour nap.

246
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:06,150
And then I came back to the, I came back to the fucking venue to watch the last game.

247
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:12,470
So, cause I was like, I can't, I can't stay in here for three to four hours.

248
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,510
I'm so tired

249
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:24,790
So and then I checked I Checked my phone Joki woke up.

250
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,330
No, you know how I woke up?

251
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:48,590
I got spam called like six times on WeChat I got spam called six times on WeChat because they're like you had to get up Because I think it's gonna be the last game, but luckily I got back just in time for Envy to win another game.

252
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:51,770
So because of that, I made it just in time.

253
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:54,710
I literally made it back for the last game.

254
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,770
Wake up, don't keep.

255
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:08,910
So I just mean, just because Envy managed to win another game.

256
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:12,590
So they didn't get absolutely steamrolled.

257
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:13,770
Thank God.

258
00:37:15,090 --> 00:38:45,470

268
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:35,490

Very business-like.

272
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:14,570
Yes.

00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:24,490

Yeah, that's me.

278
00:40:37,370 --> 00:42:10,010
um let's see I almost posted this photo um I almost posted this photo but then I was like wait then people will know where I'm going I was like oh don't do it don't do it Doki um but uh but they recently upgraded their they recently upgraded um their planes so that it's actually crazy you can like close the doors now um okay i actually i took a picture of this uh i took a picture of it um and sent it to my friends because i was like oh my god i was like oh my god you can okay so there's a picture i took i can't show it because it has like reflection and stuff because it was a tv but basically um the tv you can click on this i don't remember what i told you guys about this but um you can click on the screen and it shows like if the bathroom is occupied or not i was like oh my god technology is so amazing because like i don't have to check the itself I literally click on the screen and it shows me if the bathroom is occupied and it's so I was like the future is now I was like oh my god I

279
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:27,150
don't have to get up I can actually like click and I took a picture of that and I sent it to some of my friends I was like look at this oh my okay the funniest thing is that I was watching boss baby

280
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:54,490
I was watching boss baby so it shows at the bottom like when my friend was like my friends was like why are you watching the boss baby back in business movie I was like that's not the point that's not the point, that is not the point here the point is that technology She is beautiful.

281
00:42:55,170 --> 00:43:01,230
And I can check the screen to know when I can go to the bathroom.

282
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,950
That is the most important thing here.

283
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:04,770
The photo.

284
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:07,670
Don't worry about that.

285
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:11,530
This isn't about boss, baby.

286
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:16,650
Anyway.

287
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:20,070
So that's all.

288
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:20,850
That's so cool.

289
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:23,130
And then they also had a thing.

290
00:43:23,190 --> 00:44:24,350
where um you can do if you have someone else i don't even i think like if they're sitting in like i don't know economy or any other seats in the plane um um excuse you many but that was actually my first time watching boss baby back in business where um the mr boss baby and his brother got are like older now and then like they turn back and then them and um the brother's kid uh work together to stop another baby and it's a different movie i have yet to watch that one all right so i've technically watched all the boss babies tv shows and movies now that was the one boss baby movie that i have not yet watched but now i can safely say i've consumed all the boss baby media so i i am the boss baby now i Why?

291
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:30,070
Yes, there's Boss Baby, there's a Boss Baby TV show, and I watched all two seasons of it on Netflix.

292
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:34,070
Um, it was years ago, okay, it was, it was years ago.

293
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:35,430
I watched it when it came out.

294
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:41,650
Okay, I, yes, the Boss Baby extended years here first.

295
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:45,170
Um, yes, there were two seasons.

296
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:47,010
What about the book?

297
00:44:47,270 --> 00:45:18,050
Well, the book doesn't, I mean, I feel like the movies and the TV show was a better at, was, I never read the book even though I know the book was the original but I know I would be very disappointed because the movies and TV shows cannot could not um live up to the expectations that it gives me um and I feel like the book is the inferior uh like the inferior copy out of all of them because by when the book was main um they didn't have Alec Baldwin in mind

298
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:29,890
So it's so hard to imagine the baby being a boss baby when it doesn't even look like Alec Baldwin.

299
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:30,870
You know?

300
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:34,810
Okay, Valid.

301
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:41,430
Like, yeah, he is the boss baby.

302
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:46,370
Um, yes, if you guys didn't know, boss baby actually won an Oscar, by the way.

303
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:53,130
Um, no book has Baldwin in mind.

304
00:45:54,270 --> 00:46:22,270
as someone that also grew up watching 30 rock like um he just i don't know he just plays the boss really well like anyway anyway not only that not only could i see when the bathroom um was occupied it had a watch together tab so you could watch something with someone else that's sitting some like i don't know it wouldn't be funny if i just do a knock knock and i just like randomly be like like,

305
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:23,410
hey, can I watch this movie?

306
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:33,730
You just get a random request from, like, some random person sitting somewhere and was like, hello, I would like to watch this movie.

307
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:36,590
I see you're watching this movie.

308
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:40,470
Can I watch this alongside with you and sync it up together?

309
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:41,870
So it had this.

310
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:42,370
Okay.

311
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:46,470
I even took a picture about it because I was like, what the fuck?

312
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:49,370
So it had, like, a watch together tab.

313
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:55,650
I was just thinking, like, oh my God, I could just like be like, Hi, can I like watch?

314
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:57,030
Like, I don't know how it worked.

315
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:58,630
I got too nervous clicking it.

316
00:46:58,870 --> 00:47:00,850
I wonder if it's like, you don't even know.

317
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:04,930
You don't even know that this person is watching this movie with you.

318
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:08,770
Like, just stalking your videos and stuff.

319
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:11,750
I was like, because I was like, I didn't press it because I got scared.

320
00:47:11,870 --> 00:48:40,710
I was like, oh, what if like they get a notification that like this person on a, like, at like, I don't know, 5C, decide it's like what's to watch this movie with you and that's pretty cute yeah and because i'm like who is this person that's trying to like watch the same movie as me like just some random person on the plane uh so so i i didn't press it but i thought that was such a cool feature i was like oh my god like what the oh also here here you go all right look oh my god i can close the door i was like oh my god it pays truly the rich have too many rights like i was like oh my god i can have a door i was like oh my god like the old cafe pacific business class didn't have a door so i was like um i truly had the ultimate technology right there yes 3k for a door oh my god pay to win let's go pay to win exists guys um anyway um i need to get more water i'll be right back guys give me a sec gotta get my water

321
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:30,250

324
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:35,710
So this is like the first picture I took um when I saw Hong Kong.

325
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:37,950
I was like oh my god there it is.

326
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:41,990
It was like super nostalgic for me seeing all of this.

327
00:49:42,570 --> 00:49:48,210
Like seeing all the skyscrapers because like I don't know like when you're in Canada there's not a lot of skyscrapers.

328
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:55,230
There's a lot of mountains and everything but it's not a lot of skyscrapers um and like you know um it is a fishing village.

329
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:59,790
It used to be a fishing village So foggy.

330
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:09,530
Yes, this was what happened for the black rain This is why I didn't realize There was a rainstorm.

331
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:19,790
You can barely tell I think that was the black rain, guys Like I think that was when the black rain was about to start

332
00:50:23,590 --> 00:51:53,850
But that was the first picture I took when I was like uh there's god that's kong kong and then this was me not knowing this is past turkey not knowing how fucked up the rest of her playwrights gonna be she's she's so hopeful look at the hope in here um yeah seconds from disaster i'm like yippee moments but little does she know little does she know a lot of shit was gonna happen after that um and then here's me taking a picture of 7-eleven because like i don't know i've it was like i got off the airport and i went straight i got off the plane i went straight to the 7-eleven i took a picture of it because i was like oh look 7-eleven no way look it's very nostalgic okay it's a bit i was i felt very nostalgic nostalgic um seeing the 7-eleven because there's okay there's there's a reason why and it's this particular drink so for those who don't know this is one of my favorite drinks that i get in 7-eleven every time when i used to live in uh when i used to live in hong kong and it's like um

00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:00,840
I wouldn't resell it because it was a gift.

377

It was a gift from the staff.

378
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:04,660
For anyone, the staff, you're watching this.

399
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:22,820
I think, okay, I think weddings are a scam.

400
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:25,740
I'm gonna, I can't say it.

401
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:31,020
I think, I think weddings are such a fucking waste of money.

402
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:32,220
I think I said it before.

403
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:40,020
Um, um, because like, oh, it's so expensive for no fucking reason, too.

404
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:47,840
Like, you gotta book the venue and then like, oh, and then you have to book the venue, which is also like crazy expensive, and then you have to get like wedding photography.

405
00:59:47,860 --> 01:00:14,780
first and then a dress that you're only gonna wear once like don't fucking lie to me you're gonna wear this dress once and then apparently you have to pay for the bridesmaids dresses too but they have to be uglier than yours so they don't upstage you um and and then like i don't know people who do destination weddings you don't care about your family or friends you don't because why the Fuck would you make them?

406
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:16,940
Unless you're paying for their travels.

407
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:18,580
Unless you're paying for their travels.

408
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:27,760
But if you are fucking getting a destination wedding and, like, expecting your family and friends to fly, like, overseas to, like, I don't know.

409
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:30,480
To whatever destination you choose.

410
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:33,580
And then expect them to also get you gifts as well.

411
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:35,280
Like, that's too much, man.

412
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:38,040
That's, that's, that's too fucking much.

413
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:43,700
Um, um, um.

414
01:00:43,720 --> 01:01:02,960
But yeah, no, I think, I personally think, and drama too, there's so much drama when it, oh, and I had to pay for the flower girl's fucking dress as well, like, bitch, get your own dress, like, you're seven, you're not gonna remember this, by the way,

415
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:49,000
I was the flower girl for one of my mom's friends, um, I, I'll say, I'll say, I was, so boring but like like child's gonna be really boring too i did not but you you did not get thinking that is i was that child i wish i wasn't the flower girl i clearly you remember yes because i was no i wasn't even said it i was like no i was older because like i can't i had to fly back from china to go to her fucking life wedding to be the flower girl i was like i was like 12 like 11 or 12.

416
01:01:49,500 --> 01:03:03,620
that's why i remember that's why that's why i remember um so you prove that proves yeah but you know what i i went to sleep at the dress because i was so okay i was so bored and i was so tired that like because like okay she was a one okay because it was like okay so it was like the pre-wedding the wedding and then the it was because you know okay for those who don't know um um they did like chinese wedding and then like western wedding so you know like the western wedding where like you know you're in the church and everything and then after that there's the chinese wedding which is like which isn't really like which is basically like a big banquet a big banquet and everything so with everybody we're like during it's sort of like the um so yeah like the the big banquet at the restaurant um for the chinese style wedding so she combined both so you know like the the bride would visit every tape the bride and the the groom will visit every table um to like do stuff i don't remember

417
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:10,200
And, you know, there's like mini games and stuff like that and everything.

418
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:12,020
So, and all of that.

419
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:21,620
And then in the middle of that, I went to the backstage and just went to bed and just slept because I was so tired.

420
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:25,040
I was like, this is past my bedtime.

421
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:28,080
I got this.

422
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:30,940
I was like, oh, I'm so sleepy.

423
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:35,100
And then she took me to the backstage, like the dressing room or whatever.

424
01:03:36,640 --> 01:04:08,020
down on the couch and just slept um um but yeah no i personally think um giant ass weddings i feel i don't know i feel like i feel like it's if it's a small wedding where you're like you know really close family and friends like that i understand but the giant ass weddings were like you don't even know some of the people you invite i'm i just think like that's such a That's just a scam for me.

425
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:12,200
I feel like you can use that money for a house.

426
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:18,980
And I remember watching, there was this like Netflix show or whatever that was like wedding or house.

427
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:23,860
I remember there was a, it was like a Netflix show.

428
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:30,740
Where they asked a bunch of couples, like which one do you want?

429
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:31,940
A wedding or a house.

430
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:36,620
And then apparently majority of the couples picked up.

431
01:04:36,640 --> 01:05:03,540
dream wedding and i was like are you fucking stupid like why the fuck would you pick a fucking why would you not pick a house in this economy what what do you mean a house is so much more like worth it like at least you can if you don't like the house you can sell it later because the house's value will keep going up until the bubble pops but then we don't think about that

432
01:05:07,000 --> 01:06:33,120
house hurts if you don't like the house just rent the house make it an airbnb who the fuck is like just make it an airbnb why the fuck would you why the fuck would you pick a dream wedding um yeah but yeah no that's that's my opinion on uh weddings in general um but yes anyway um the I need to know how much is the lychee lychee berry la boo boo Lychee berry la boo boo bye I need to know oh it's like 90 okay it's not as bad Okay my sesame milk is 80 so like it's not as bad They're just like I don't know I thought my sesame I don't know I mean it's gray I didn't oh it's like you know I guess they're like ten dollars more expensive um um but i i didn't i didn't i think i didn't i think the gray one is not like as pretty but i guess some people like the sesame a lot yeah the sesame or sesame bean sorry sesame is it oh wait they actually brought sesame no it is sesame bean yeah uh what about the brown one apparently the the secret one what was it toffee is that the secret what is it no

433
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:34,480

What the fuck?

451
01:07:07,180 --> 01:08:56,640
jesus christ it's two it's 276 dollars holy shit oh that's crazy but it's apparently easier to find in in china for the boobus than it is in an na right now i mean they literally were giving it to us for free so an $80 labubu we live in a labubu society uh i got i got an $80 labubu for free yeah it's it's real it's not a labufu it's a labubu um anyway so where was that all right but that was my that was my my free labubu from the staff what 100 profit yeah exactly also my this out recently um let me double check the picture though i found this out because i just realized there's a tv there so let me double check this picture real quick uh just making sure making sure all right yeah okay so i remember if i remember if i talked about this before on the last stream um but so this was my hotel room and I mean look at the fucking size of that bed like like it was just for me like and um and it was for free too by the way so I was on all the content creators were on the VIP floor so yeah so

452
01:08:56,640 --> 01:10:02,620
and I was you know I I came by myself so like I got some people that had like plus a lot of the content creators had like plus one and stuff so yeah for me and my labubu for me and my labubu um um so it was so funny because um i was on the vip floor um and apparently i just found out this recently but all everybody else like you know the casters the players um the the other like uh the other staff from other teams they were on the floors below us they were on they were on the the poor floor so and then all the content creators that got invited were in the VIP floor.

453
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:16,560
The funny thing is, well, I wasn't paid to be here, but the content creators, some of the content creators were paid to be here, so not only were they paid to, because, like, you know, the players weren't paid to play, you know, like, they were by their,

454
01:10:16,740 --> 01:10:24,280
you know, by their org, but, like, it's not like, you know, net use or slash Marvel rivals, like, um, pay them to come over.

455
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:25,700
They didn't buy their flights.

456
01:10:25,700 --> 01:11:18,600
they buy their flights and everything um you know but i thought it was really funny that we got the vip floor and um and then everybody else were on the floors below us uh so i was like hey that's right i am above all of you yeah it's like yeah i just found this out recently like i thought it was really funny that um we got the we were at the vi because it literally said vip that was the thing because i didn't know i didn't really i wasn't thinking about it but yeah the one above all but our floor literally at in the elevator it's the number the name the there's like you know there's like a tag next to the number and it literally says vip

457
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:26,420
I thought it was so funny

458
01:11:29,880 --> 01:12:35,880
Because I thought everybody was on On my floor Because I was like Oh that's nice You know I was like oh I get to be on the VIP floor Wow that's nice Oh I can't believe All of us got to be on this floor And then later I found out Like because you know like on the elevator You see like you know when you get in the elevator With the like Other people you know there'd be people there look at the same elevator and then i just pretend that i'm just you know short like not i'm just like a regular chinese citizen uh just who happened to be in the same hotel and then you know you know they're all wearing their jersey and everything and they'll just be like on the 10th floor and then i'll be like i'm on the 11th floor that's right i'm heading to the vip floor um which i i just thought that was really funny

459
01:12:40,820 --> 01:13:59,660
all right let's see uh what else what else oh yeah here is here's marvo ramas there's like it's basically just like it was the like wall next to the entrance to the venue so it just says marble rivals and then there's the there's the trophy for it they have a giant replica of the trophy outside too and um yeah the phototype yeah and then it's like you know marble rivals ain't there for those who don't know the tournament was at at the net use campus so um um so um the campus it was it was basically felt like a university campus in general so uh so and they have like four i talked about it before it but they have four different campuses scattered around guanjo uh for net ease so this was one of them and it was basically like its own university campus where it had like a pharmacy they had pharmacy they had a cafeteria um they had like a coffee shop they had like a little like uh 711 shop too where you know like people want to just buy buy like small things there they have like a hair

460
01:13:59,660 --> 01:14:26,820
salon it was crazy it was just like a lot of minis and they had the peacocks oh yeah i'll show you guys the peacocks there for the feng shui for those who didn't know okay so they had a uh it was all men too it was just all male peacocks but they had a peacock enclosure um Feng Shui at the campus and apparently each campus for net ease has a different animal depending on what the feng shui master said.

461
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:41,260
So the feng shui master was like you've got to put penguins on this campus to up your feng shui and then the CEO put ping like sorry we got you gotta put peacocks sorry not penguins you gotta put peacocks on this specific campus and you want more feng shui.

462
01:14:45,240 --> 01:16:00,020
what the staff told me was that each campus had different types of animals depending on what the feng shui master like like um um said so i thought that was like super interesting uh but yeah no i was just like oh my god there's the peacocks like there they are um yeah so i don't know what the other campus had i i didn't ask them um oh there's the coffee shop i don't know why i took a picture the coffee shop but there's there's a net ease coffee shop i was just like look at that there it is um they they like always um there's like it's just like you know it's just there to get coffee that's really it nothing special i was just like look there's a there's a coffee shop what a nice side oh and then in the coffee shop they had all these little figures too um apparently I didn't know this because like I know that the 80s was a very big company in China um but basically like these were like figures of all their out from their other games and everything um but apparently um uh Marvel rivals

463

Okay, so there's something very special about this particular photo.

573
01:28:15,550 --> 01:28:16,810

575
01:28:24,610 --> 01:28:31,170

Like, if you turn left, there was a hallway of, like, more wax figures of, important inventors of, like, around the world.

644
01:43:59,110 --> 01:44:00,670
Because that's so weird.

645
01:44:01,110 --> 01:44:04,850
So, so there were, like, all different inventors and stuff.

646
01:44:05,130 --> 01:44:07,190
And, like, it was, like, wax figures.

647
01:44:07,710 --> 01:44:09,810
And I was, like, I was so confused.

648
01:44:09,970 --> 01:44:11,150
I was, like, what?

649
01:44:11,710 --> 01:44:25,130
And then there's Dino Land where there's like fossils and like, you know, like fossils and like, you know, dinosaur bones and whatever, like constructing and everything.

650
01:44:26,130 --> 01:44:30,630
And yeah, it's like, it's all over the place.

651
01:44:31,010 --> 01:44:35,950
Like, and then on another floor, on another area, let me find the fucking Dino Land picture.

652
01:44:36,150 --> 01:44:38,070
I'm like, what the fuck am I?

653
01:44:38,710 --> 01:44:39,890

There's, here's, there's a Sedona area.

656
01:44:49,230 --> 01:44:52,850
And you can ride a, I guess you can ride a dinosaur.

They even had a shooting range, too, to test your accuracy.

669
01:48:55,730 --> 01:48:57,650
Like, you know, like the Olympics pistol stuff?

671
01:48:59,070 --> 01:49:00,050
Like, there's no real bullets.

672
01:49:00,170 --> 01:49:01,530

I've never watched Wanda Vision.

760

Okay, I never, I don't watch Marvel movies.

761
01:58:57,270 --> 01:59:01,630
I say as I told you guys, I'm a DC girl.

762
01:59:02,890 --> 01:59:06,150
Movies-wise, animated film slash movie-wise.

763
01:59:06,790 --> 01:59:09,690
But gaming-wise, I'm a Marvel girl.

764
01:59:10,970 --> 01:59:12,930
DC doesn't have good games.

765
01:59:13,350 --> 01:59:15,410
Gaming-wise, I'm a Marvel girl.

766
01:59:16,070 --> 01:59:27,710
But the only Marvel films I did watch and I did like are Guardians of the Galaxy, all three of the movies.

767
01:59:30,770 --> 01:59:41,230
The first Thor movie, because I'm a low-key girl, I was one of those, I was one of the like the Tom Hilsson girls, just so you know, on Tumblr, I was...

787
02:04:22,850 --> 02:04:27,390
Oh, yeah, um, I wanted to get an autograph.

788
02:04:27,610 --> 02:04:30,110
Like, I did get, I got an autograph from the entire team.

789
02:04:30,650 --> 02:04:32,670
Okay, the fun, okay, it was so sad.

790
02:04:32,790 --> 02:04:36,350
I wanted to get an autograph with, um, this team.

791
02:04:36,950 --> 02:04:42,850
And, um, so, like, you know, watch them one, because luckily I came back when they played the last game, luckily.

792
02:04:43,450 --> 02:04:46,130
Um, but I wanted to get, like, envy as well.

793
02:04:46,350 --> 02:04:51,230
But, like, the moment, the moment they lost, they left, they left the building.

794
02:04:53,030 --> 02:05:19,690
because like i was waiting outside like because i didn't want like because like people were leaving and i was trying to be like incognito and then like i was waiting outside and then like all like everybody in envy just like packed instantly packed their things and just left and yeah yeah they were they were they were so sad and then i was talking to one of the staff members i was like we think it's a bad idea if i ask them for their autographs in the elevator

795
02:05:25,270 --> 02:05:27,790
They're like, no, I think it's a bad idea.

796
02:05:28,690 --> 02:05:35,870
Because I was like, I guess I was like, they're like, I was like, I don't think they want to give you an autograph.

797
02:05:36,350 --> 02:05:42,050
I right now, like, what if like, what if it was in the hotel lobby?

798
02:05:42,190 --> 02:05:45,810
I was like, you think they'll be, they'll recover by this.

799
02:05:49,370 --> 02:05:53,110
Yeah, you see, yeah, anyway.

800
02:05:55,270 --> 02:06:27,330
like oh man i traveled all the way oh i didn't and then they're like no because then they'll think they disappointed you you know like they'll be like oh man another family disappointed and i was like oh you're right maybe i should and then and then i was about to like go up to them myself myself um to like get the autograph um uh And,

801
02:06:28,030 --> 02:06:32,390
and, uh, and then, because I was like, oh, I could just be incognito.

802
02:06:32,770 --> 02:06:35,530
And then I was stopped because they were like, are you stupid?

803
02:06:35,930 --> 02:06:38,370
Like, two of them actually watch you.

804
02:06:39,830 --> 02:06:41,750
Because I was like, huh?

805
02:06:41,990 --> 02:06:43,330
I was like, wait, what?

806
02:06:43,990 --> 02:06:47,430
Apparently two of the players, they're actually, like, watch me.

807
02:06:47,830 --> 02:06:50,670
They're like, don't go up to them to get their autograph.

808
02:06:51,230 --> 02:06:55,250
Because two of them actually watched your, your, your stream.

809
02:06:55,270 --> 02:07:54,490
like watch like my Marvel rivals stuff so they know who I am so I was like oh but I want to get their autographs so so like I couldn't go up to the like so I had someone else go up to them and like sign my like sign a little thing I took a picture of it but it's on Twitter I didn't save it on my PC but um I have all the signatures of the champions yeah no I had someone else like go up to them and have them sign the entire thing um why didn't you get it before because i didn't think they were gonna win okay i i okay i didn't know who was gonna win okay i didn't know who was gonna win i was like okay i want to get i don't want to get autographs from the champions because i didn't know i didn't know who was gonna win so i waited until the finals And sorry,

810
02:07:54,610 --> 02:07:55,650
like, it ended.

811
02:07:56,270 --> 02:08:00,490
And then, no, they don't say that.

812
02:08:00,830 --> 02:08:02,890
I got their autographs, though, in the end.

813
02:08:03,070 --> 02:08:04,710
Okay, I got their autographs.

814
02:08:08,870 --> 02:08:09,830
Fake fan.

815
02:08:10,990 --> 02:08:11,590
Yeah, okay.

816
02:08:11,830 --> 02:08:14,370
If I was a fake fan, what does that say about...

817
02:08:14,370 --> 02:08:16,530
I was the only one that got all their autographs, though.

818
02:08:17,030 --> 02:08:19,710
I don't think anyone else got all their autographs.

819
02:08:19,850 --> 02:08:20,890
I did.

820
02:08:24,810 --> 02:08:27,630
I tried to get autographs from Envy, okay?

821
02:08:27,810 --> 02:08:37,910
I tried, but they like, they like instantly left and then I was told that it was not a good idea to approach them because they were so depressed.

822
02:08:38,450 --> 02:08:39,790
They were so sad.

823
02:08:40,310 --> 02:08:43,330
They're like, they're like, no, don't approach the doki.

824
02:08:43,710 --> 02:08:49,350
I don't think it's a good idea to ask for their autographs right now.

825
02:08:49,850 --> 02:08:52,870
So I did it out of respect, I didn't do it.

826
02:08:53,830 --> 02:08:54,610
I did it.

827
02:08:57,990 --> 02:08:59,510
Yeah, they left so fast.

828
02:08:59,610 --> 02:09:00,470
It wasn't even over.

829
02:09:00,670 --> 02:09:03,870
Like, literally, like, the closing ceremonies was still going on.

830
02:09:03,970 --> 02:09:05,110
And they were gone.

831
02:09:05,290 --> 02:09:12,190
Because, like, it was, like, you know, because, um, they were, they were, like, in the winners bracket.

832
02:09:13,050 --> 02:09:16,830
Um, because, like, they were, they were, like, literally in the winners bracket.

833
02:09:16,930 --> 02:09:19,910
And because Rad Esports came from the losers brackets, too.

834
02:09:20,410 --> 02:09:23,810
So, because, uh, MV knocked, I think.

835
02:09:23,830 --> 02:09:47,410
envy was the one that knocked rad esports um to the losers bracket so like nobody expected like people that's why they thought it was going to be like super close um so that's why like you know it was more upsetting because like um because they were meant to be on the winners yeah it was a lot yeah it was a lot of emotions and stuff

836
02:09:51,300 --> 02:09:58,240
that's why that's why i went back to the hotel to take a nap because Because I didn't know what was going to happen.

837
02:10:00,720 --> 02:10:03,520
That's exactly why I went back to the hotel.

838
02:10:03,960 --> 02:10:05,940
Because I was like, it's going to be a long day.

839
02:10:06,160 --> 02:10:07,980
I need to take a fucking nap.

840
02:10:08,080 --> 02:10:08,840

Okay, so.

895
02:17:22,350 --> 02:17:23,230
I mean, this is it.

896
02:17:23,430 --> 02:17:24,290
I'm not gonna...

897
02:17:24,290 --> 02:17:25,530
I'm gonna lower the volume.

898
02:17:26,070 --> 02:17:28,170
But yeah, so this is like basically what this...

899
02:17:28,170 --> 02:17:30,050
So you see, like, it's not...

900
02:17:30,050 --> 02:17:32,290
It was full during the finals, basically.

901
02:17:32,450 --> 02:17:33,650
Because, you know, everybody...

902
02:17:33,650 --> 02:17:34,130
But it's all like...

903
02:17:34,130 --> 02:17:36,830
This was, like, I think, like, day one or day two.

904
02:17:37,810 --> 02:17:38,210
So...

905
02:17:38,210 --> 02:17:40,630
But yeah, that's basically what it looked like in the back.

906
02:17:41,230 --> 02:17:42,330
So, and then...

907
02:17:42,330 --> 02:17:43,890
But it was full during day...

908
02:17:44,330 --> 02:17:46,130
Like the last day it was full.

909
02:17:46,850 --> 02:17:48,430
Yeah, but...

910
02:17:48,430 --> 02:17:50,990
But this was literally on campus, by the way.

911
02:17:51,130 --> 02:17:53,310
This was, like, on campus and everything.

912
02:17:53,790 --> 02:17:56,250
So, I thought that was, like, the really cool part.

913
02:17:56,350 --> 02:17:58,770
Like, they held all of this in their own...

914
02:17:58,770 --> 02:18:01,810
Like, in their own office area.

915
02:18:02,250 --> 02:18:04,030
So, like, in one of the buildings.

916
02:18:04,250 --> 02:18:05,890
So I thought that was pretty neat.

917
02:18:06,030 --> 02:18:10,130
The fact that they didn't rent, like, they didn't rent, like, a venue for it.

918
02:18:10,450 --> 02:18:12,150
It was all hosted in the...

919
02:18:12,150 --> 02:18:13,850
In the NetEase building.

920
02:18:14,330 --> 02:18:44,410
um so they had like a whole building um that could basically have the entire land area yeah i thought it was really cool um oh so here's a panda look at this big old big boy look at this big boy oh wow look at him i felt like he looked like like an uncle you know like an old uncle sitting outside the patio and He's like,

921
02:18:44,730 --> 02:18:49,310
um, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

922
02:18:50,450 --> 02:18:52,570
He's like, um, yum, yum.

923
02:19:00,010 --> 02:19:02,270
But yeah, there he is.

924
02:19:02,390 --> 02:19:04,030
He just looked like an uncle.

925
02:19:04,650 --> 02:19:07,230
This is still my favorite video so far.

926
02:19:08,150 --> 02:19:09,390

Uh-uh.

931
02:19:19,030 --> 02:19:28,410

932
02:19:29,050 --> 02:19:30,050
It was a good trip.

933
02:19:30,590 --> 02:19:31,630
I had a fun time.

934
02:19:31,830 --> 02:19:34,630
I had a fun time hanging out with the staff and just exploring.

935
02:19:36,990 --> 02:19:37,510
Um...

936
02:19:37,510 --> 02:19:38,670
Exploring everything.

937
02:19:40,650 --> 02:19:41,970

940
02:20:22,690 --> 02:20:23,890
And I'm so confused.

941
02:20:24,290 --> 02:20:26,470
But this is a, I just, I don't know.

942
02:20:26,570 --> 02:20:27,670
It's a famous pig.

943
02:20:27,830 --> 02:20:29,670
I don't know who he is.

944
02:20:30,270 --> 02:20:37,530
But people were like, like in WeChat, the staff kept using his like face as an emoji.

945
02:20:38,150 --> 02:20:39,770
So I don't know who he is.

946
02:20:39,990 --> 02:20:41,290
I don't know.

947
02:20:41,710 --> 02:20:42,710
I see him.

948
02:20:42,710 --> 02:20:44,170
I see him everywhere.

949
02:20:44,470 --> 02:20:46,570
I don't know who he is, but he's everywhere.

950
02:20:47,910 --> 02:20:49,770
He's like everywhere in China.

951
02:20:50,330 --> 02:20:52,310
I wish I knew, but I don't.

952
02:20:52,650 --> 02:20:54,750
I closed my eyes and I see him.

953
02:20:59,390 --> 02:20:59,990
I don't know.

954
02:21:01,410 --> 02:21:03,030
It's that pig from the internet.

955
02:21:03,410 --> 02:21:04,050
I have no idea.

956
02:21:05,690 --> 02:21:08,130
What else can I know I want to talk about?

957
02:21:10,010 --> 02:21:11,390
Oh, you know what's funny?

958
02:21:12,350 --> 02:21:16,210
Apparently, there's a KTV next to our hotel.

959
02:21:17,130 --> 02:21:19,950
And, but the KTV... Oh, I forgot to tell you guys the story.

960
02:21:23,470 --> 02:21:25,330
There's a KTV next to our hotel.

961
02:21:27,510 --> 02:21:31,190
But, because, like, I was telling this story.

962
02:21:31,710 --> 02:21:33,290
I want my friends about it.

963
02:21:34,050 --> 02:21:37,010
Because, like, it was, like, one of the teams.

964
02:21:37,850 --> 02:21:40,790
I mean, they told me the story about it, like, I think, like, yesterday.

965
02:21:41,330 --> 02:21:45,190
They're telling me that they were like, oh, yeah, you know how there was a KTV next to the hotel?

966
02:21:45,270 --> 02:21:46,910
And I was like, It's karaoke.

967
02:21:47,770 --> 02:21:50,270
Sorry, for those who don't know what KTV is, it's karaoke.

968
02:21:52,490 --> 02:21:57,610
And so my friend was like, yeah, like me and the team, we wanted to go karaoke.

969
02:21:58,450 --> 02:21:59,450
So like we went there.

970
02:22:00,250 --> 02:22:11,230
Apparently they were like, sorry, you have to book in advance to like be able to be able to like come and use the karaoke.

971
02:22:12,170 --> 02:22:15,890
So then they were like very confused because they're like.

972
02:22:15,990 --> 02:22:22,550
what do you mean book it in advance and then they gave them the business card and it was an

973
02:22:26,330 --> 02:22:30,050
it was an escort service ktv

974
02:22:35,290 --> 02:22:53,710
that's why i was six to the hotel i was like six to the hotel i was like

975
02:23:00,350 --> 02:23:10,270
And then they sent me the picture of, oh, I wish, I wish, oh my gosh, they deleted the picture, so I didn't save it.

976
02:23:11,370 --> 02:23:16,290
I don't think, okay, I don't think I should show you guys, because it was so suggestive.

977
02:23:16,490 --> 02:23:18,410
I saw the business card.

978
02:23:19,010 --> 02:23:23,230
It was like, it was like very suggestive.

979
02:23:31,370 --> 02:23:59,950
I said wish I took a fix I wish I had saved the picture of the of the business card because when I saw it I was like I was like wait so because I saw that because it says like KTV it was a big sign that says like KTV and Okay, I'll illustrate from what I could remember.

980
02:24:00,090 --> 02:24:03,170
I'll illustrate it on page from what I could remember.

981
02:24:04,050 --> 02:24:13,390
So she was like, wait, let's see.

982
02:24:17,920 --> 02:24:18,420
Okay, wait.

983
02:24:32,520 --> 02:24:34,100
Okay, give me a sec

984
02:24:37,260 --> 02:24:42,980
and then

985
02:24:53,090 --> 02:24:54,790
Oh my god,

986
02:24:58,320 --> 02:25:01,060
okay, okay

987
02:25:05,500 --> 02:25:09,260
Okay, okay, okay

988
02:25:13,120 --> 02:25:22,860
So this was what this was what on one of the it was like the front or the back I don't remember but This was...

989
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:26,500
This...

990
02:25:27,420 --> 02:25:29,000
This is what I remembered.

991
02:25:31,460 --> 02:25:33,740
So she was wearing...

992
02:25:33,740 --> 02:25:35,340
She was wearing a bikini.

993
02:25:35,820 --> 02:25:37,320
She was wearing...

994
02:25:37,320 --> 02:25:38,560
Or her... I don't know.

995
02:25:38,640 --> 02:25:39,960
Or it wasn't her bra and underwear.

996
02:25:40,100 --> 02:25:41,040
I don't fucking know.

997
02:25:44,080 --> 02:25:44,580
But...

998
02:25:44,580 --> 02:25:45,480
But just...

999
02:25:47,280 --> 02:25:50,360
But this is what... This is a... What is this?

1000
02:25:50,380 --> 02:26:11,280
business card side looked like where the the ktv business card and so i don't know i don't know if she was wearing a bikini or it was her bra and underwear but i i saw that um and i was just like oh my god

1001
02:26:18,400 --> 02:26:33,780
um yeah And so I thought, oh, that's why I like, they couldn't go to the karaoke because they're like, you got to book it in advance.

1002
02:26:37,020 --> 02:26:39,320
Like, you got to book it in advance.

1003
02:26:39,840 --> 02:26:41,320
You can't call this number.

1004
02:26:42,060 --> 02:26:48,560
If you want to book it, if you want to book it, you can call the number on the business card.

1005
02:26:54,400 --> 02:27:01,980
It was, I don't know, I don't remember, I don't remember what the microphone, what kind of microphone it was.

1006
02:27:02,400 --> 02:27:06,240
Man, I was thinking about the super chat, thank you, thank you, new outfit.

1007
02:27:07,060 --> 02:27:13,960
So, so I was just like, oh, that's freaky, yeah, it's just, it's just normal karaoke things, you know?

1008
02:27:14,340 --> 02:27:23,360
It's normal, I don't know, I don't know, I wasn't the one with the book, I didn't realize that was, I just saw there was a KTV next to our hotel.

1009
02:27:23,560 --> 02:27:25,460
I never realized what it was.

1010
02:27:25,740 --> 02:27:27,900
I didn't ask questions.

1011
02:27:28,260 --> 02:27:28,880
I didn't.

1012
02:27:29,500 --> 02:27:32,140
A good soldier follows orders.

1013
02:27:32,440 --> 02:27:34,180
I didn't ask questions.

1014
02:27:34,860 --> 02:27:36,560
It's fucking wild, though.

1015
02:27:45,320 --> 02:27:50,360
But it was a wild, wild, a week.

1016
02:27:50,380 --> 02:28:21,420

1018
02:28:22,980 --> 02:28:27,580
But for those who didn't know, I almost had a chance to network with the Sentinel CEO.

1019
02:28:28,800 --> 02:28:29,480
He's like a...

1020
02:28:29,480 --> 02:28:31,540
I didn't realize how important...

1021
02:28:31,540 --> 02:28:32,060
Like, he's like...

1022
02:28:32,060 --> 02:28:34,520
I knew he was very important because, you know, he's the Sentinel CEO.

1023
02:28:34,760 --> 02:28:40,260
And Sentinel is the number one NA eSport org right now in NA.

1024
02:28:40,460 --> 02:28:42,980
So they have a really popular, like, Valorant background.

02:28:46,080 --> 02:28:48,100
Yeah, he followed me back on Twitter.

1026
02:28:48,860 --> 02:28:50,060
And he, like...

1027
02:28:50,660 --> 02:28:51,800
Yeah, I got a photo.

Let me find...

1030
02:28:57,420 --> 02:28:59,900
I got a photo with him, but I never, like, interacted with him.

1031
02:29:00,560 --> 02:29:03,940
I just had someone else go up to him and ask him for the photo.

1032
02:29:04,380 --> 02:29:05,660
I just...

1033
02:29:09,040 --> 02:29:12,340
But let me show you the photo with Rob.

1034
02:29:12,780 --> 02:29:13,880

1036
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:17,340

1039
02:31:04,160 --> 02:31:08,080

1040
02:31:11,620 --> 02:32:12,920

1041
02:32:12,940 --> 02:32:16,200
who the fuck is going to be, like, because I was like, who's coming with me to the airport?

1042
02:32:16,320 --> 02:32:17,120
I was so confused.

1043
02:32:17,200 --> 02:32:20,040
I was like, oh my God, are the other content creators are going to be there?

1044
02:32:20,120 --> 02:32:21,920
Like, oh my God, it's going to be so awkward.

1045
02:32:22,900 --> 02:32:26,940
And then later on, like, the staff was like, oh, he can't make it.

1046
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,060
He's going to take the next car in 15 minutes.

1047
02:32:29,220 --> 02:32:30,560
And I was like, who is it?

1048
02:32:30,880 --> 02:32:34,220
And then the staff was like, oh, it's the Sentinel CEO.

1049
02:32:34,460 --> 02:32:35,700
And I was like, no.

1050
02:32:36,400 --> 02:32:37,480
I was just like, no.

1051
02:32:40,530 --> 02:32:42,350
I was like, ah.

1052
02:32:44,970 --> 02:32:52,590
I was like, oh my god, I could have got a chance to like, you know, have a chat with him.

1053
02:32:53,550 --> 02:32:59,390
The one time, the one time I did not mind being exposed.

1054
02:33:01,450 --> 02:33:11,150
Yeah, so I missed the chance and then I tweeted about it and then he followed me back on Twitter and he was like, oh, if I knew it was you, I would have actually taken that car ride.

1055
02:33:11,290 --> 02:33:12,350
So I was like, what?

1056
02:33:21,460 --> 02:33:26,800
Because he was like, oh, if I knew it was you that I'll be riding with, I would have actually came down fast.

1057
02:33:26,920 --> 02:33:28,720
I would have taken the same car with you.

1058
02:33:28,980 --> 02:33:30,760
I was like, oh, my God.

1059
02:33:31,340 --> 02:33:31,780

Oh, my God.

02:33:39,300 --> 02:33:43,380
Yeah, I was like, perceive to acknowledge me.

1063
02:33:44,120 --> 02:33:45,600
Yeah, and then he followed me on Twitter.

1064
02:33:45,740 --> 02:33:46,680
I was like, oh, my God.

1065
02:33:47,320 --> 02:33:47,760
