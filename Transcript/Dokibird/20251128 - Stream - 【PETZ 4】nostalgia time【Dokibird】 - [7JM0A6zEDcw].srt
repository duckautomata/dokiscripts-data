1
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:56,930
Thanksgiving to my American Dragons We already had our
Thanksgiving last month But I know today is your

2
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:06,350
Thanksgiving now But yes, today we are playing pets It's a
very nostalgic type of game for me I played a lot of the

3
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:14,690
pets games growing up I think I played pets 3, 4, and 5
growing up 5 was my favorite because at the most options

4
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:22,130
Also, I'm here in the backyard the main adoption agency
because random dogs and cats keep coming in and i'm like no

5
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:28,810
not yet and it's also very annoying too uh today i'm feeling
very lazy i think it's this week this week i'm feeling very

6
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:38,790
it was like a very uh lazy type of week for me my brain is
running by um one kilobyte per second right now which is not

7
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:48,910
a lot uh it's it's actually it's like going like i think my
brain is a floppy disk at the moment so um it's not going

8
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:57,110
for those who don't know what floppy disk that is basically
like a usb stick but with like one third of a memory of not

9
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:03,770
even one third one fifth of a memory of a usb stick for
those who don't know what usb sticks are it's like a it's

10
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:11,630
like a hard drive but like one out of one out of a thousand
space of a hard drive for those don't know what hard drive

11
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:24,090
is it's like an sdd but one out of a two thousandth worth of
an ssd space um so i think i got all the generations in in

12
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:32,570
on the i got all i've got all the generations in on the joke
uh what is it for those who don't know what solid state

13
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:41,410
drive i'm so inclusive i know Um, for those who don't know
what a solid state drive is, it is like a Google Drive

14
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:47,850
space, but like, um, I guess like, but Google Drive has less
space than an SSD, I guess.

15
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:55,570
She is reminding us what a floppy disk is, as if our average
age isn't above 30.

16
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,370
Thank you for the super chat, Betty.

17
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,650

00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,710
I'll get a cat in here.

51
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:33,510
I don't care what cat.

52
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:36,490
I usually okay Uh, oh, I would get this cat.

53
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,910
Um, anyway, it's surprising.

54
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,930
They're not cats and dogs don't really like each other that
much.

55
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:46,110
So anyway, I used to play this game a lot growing up.

56
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:52,710
Um, I had, you know, I did have pet dogs growing up as well,
but instead of, you know, playing with my dog, I would play

57
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:57,910
with my virtual dog, uh, and my virtual cats and my
virtuals.

58
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,850
Oh my god, look, they hate each other.

59
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:00,850
so cute.

60
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,510
He's so, yes, because there's an angry cat down there.

61
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,350
Of course he's sad.

62
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,610
No, he's so scared.

63
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,270
Yes, because look at him, this cat is evil.

64
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,150
Why is he sad?

65
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,310
Because this cat's evil.

66
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,290
Look at him.

67
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:20,230
Wow.

68
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,770

00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:37,110
Oh my God.

98
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,210
He gave me the same dog three times as when I adopt him.

99
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,090

Like I said, growing up, I would play pets a lot, too.

108
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:07,710
I didn't realize actually make babies um because i didn't
realize you know you know as a kid you don't understand that

He can do that!

115
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,500
He's just...

116
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,640
Guys, I don't think you want him to play fetch with a
hairball.

117
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,700

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,280

00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,160
That's right.

128
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,360
Who's a good boy?

Oh, you guys can see.

134
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,440
That's right.

135
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,600
That's right.

136
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,200
You'd like that, don't you?

137
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,260
So, this was my childhood game.

138
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:22,680
I think, like I said, I bought all the way to Pets 5, and
then that's when they started going downhill, and then it

139
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,640
added like hamsters and horses and stuff like that.

140
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,120
And I don't fuck with that.

141
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:27,580
I'm sorry.

142
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,820
Oh, wait, there's the lock.

143
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,560
You're right.

144
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,240
Now you can never leave.

145
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,440
I didn't fuck with the fact that they added other pets.

146
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,260
I was like, no, there can only be dogs and cats.

147
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,140
But anyway, I later found out that you can make babies out
of them.

148
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:49,040
And then I started, like, forcing them to have kids.

149
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,460
Because I was like, I want more dogs and more cats.

150
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,060
And then I'm like, go!

151
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,520
Make babies.

152
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:04,460
And, like I said, this week I just wanted to play games that
were more like comfort games.

153
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:15,340
And I like was like, oh, I and like thank God for Thank God
for like like modders and stuff for being able to Make it so

154
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:23,140

So if I had a male and a female, they'll fall in love.

480

want.

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,540
What do cats play with?

490
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,860

491
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,360

498
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,020

499
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,400
Guess what?

500
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,540

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,080

00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,500
I remember this.

510
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,840
And then you light this up.

511
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,140
And then...

512
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:26,360
Yay!

00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,100

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,100
each other.

518
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,860

00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,540
Alright.

00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,460

Here's a frisbee.

522
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:40,880
Come on, guys.

523
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:41,400
Woo!

524
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,500
Where did my frisbee go?

525
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,740
Oh my god, whose dog is that?

526
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,340
Who brought their dog to the circus?

527
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,140
God.

528
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,960
Don't worry, I have more balloons.

And he doesn't.

640
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:06,150
Because he doesn't need clothes, guys.

They're having a good time.

712
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:02,930
They're just playing.

713
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:03,650

You know, let's go back to the backyard.

724

Okay, I can do this, though, to the rat, right?

739
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,650

00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:47,750
Oh!

747
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:48,890

I don't think they were meant.

859
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,380
I don't think the game allowed that.

860
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:26,420
The game was like the game was like uh, dad, a dog and cat.

How are you guys still too young?

878
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,440
You're 25 and 26.

879
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,220

880
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,320

00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:08,780
Okay.

00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:29,290
25 was too young for kids, guys.

888
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:32,450

No.

936
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,840
Dad, you homewrecker.

937
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,200
It's just some male man.

You are, I guess, I have a feeling you might not be the
father.

942
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:21,900

00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,560
Dad, junior.

946
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,680
Never trust a milkman.

947
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,100
Look, there's dad, junior.

948
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:40,440
That's...

949
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,540
Guys, that's your son right here.

950
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,260

There's your son, dragon.

00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,600
There he is.

955
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,920
He looks just like Israel.

956
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,280
Look at that!

957
00:45:58,460 --> 00:45:59,700
Hello, my wife.

958
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:02,080
That is not my son.

959
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:02,700
Wait, okay.

960
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,440
Let's bring his real father out here.

961
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,460
Look, dad.

962
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,080
Look.

963
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,880
There's your nephew, dad.

964
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:13,580
You're an uncle now.

965
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:14,900
You're an uncle.

966
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:16,500
Look at that.

967
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,100
You're an uncle, dad.

968
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:20,800
Look at that.

969
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,940
The kid is not my son.

970
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:26,080
Look at him.

971
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,560
All right, let's grab.

972
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,460
Wait, can I just bring the...

973
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:34,760
Wait, I can't...

974
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,020
Oh, can I not...

975
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:36,840
Like...

976
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:37,900
What is she doing?

977
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:39,120
Oh?

978
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:41,120
Oh my god, what is she doing?

979
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,320
Oh my god, okay, we got...

980
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,500
All right, let's grab...

981
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:48,260
Let's grab your other wife, Dad.

982
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,000
Yay!

983
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:54,960
Okay, that does not look like, I don't know, Orphan.

984
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:01,920
Okay, this one, like, none of his jeans got in here.

985
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:04,180
Like, it's just the same dog.

986
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:09,760
Like, it's just, dad is not acknowledging this dog.

987
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,280
This is not, none of his jeans even went to him.

988
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:14,080
The mom's jeans were too strong.

989
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,880
The mom's jeans were way too strong for this.

990
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:19,800
Yeah, his jeans end up in the cat.

991
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,660
He didn't even try.

992
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:25,940
The cat stole all the jeans.

993
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:29,000
This is mitosis.

994
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:31,080
Yeah, it's literally just mitosis.

995
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:33,620
All right.

996
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:34,940
Oh, wait.

997
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:36,380
I can force them to grow up.

998
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,680
Holy shit, he's huge.

999
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,360
He's like huge.

1000
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:44,120
Look at him.

1001
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,760
Oh, my God.

1002
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:46,900
Congratulations.

1003
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,080
You're a father to a college student.

1004
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:51,800
Oh, my God.

1005
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,800
Where did this guy come from?

1006
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,520
Your parents are small.

1007
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:07,240
what a unit uh it's time how do i oh my god i don't think i

1008
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,840

1010
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,680

1011
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,940
All right, let's grow up.

1012
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:32,340
Uh, oh my god.

1013
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,520
Let's make, let's grow them up too.

Oh my god.

1017
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:41,640
Yeah.

1018
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:42,760
Yeah, no.

1019
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,360
I don't think we even need a DNA test.

1020
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,400
I think we all know.

1021
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:49,300
I, he's still, yeah, he's still a little baby in his mom's
eyes.

1022
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:50,060
Yeah, he's mom.

1023
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:50,880
He's baby.

1024
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:51,600
Yeah.

1025
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:56,140
Okay, so I don't think we need a DNA test.

1026
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,700
DNA test to find out who the real father is.

1027
00:48:58,880 --> 00:48:59,760
I think we all know.

1028
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,720
None of us are willing to say it out loud, but we all know.

1029
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,460
Dad, why?

1030
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:10,500
Alright.

1031
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:16,240
Alright, so he's like...

1032
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:24,340
Alright, let's go back to the adoption center, and then...

1033
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:25,940
Let's go to South Seas Island.

00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:29,780
Acknowledged me.

1035
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:32,760
Alright, let's go.

You guys can be good friends.

I believe, look, there might be some misunderstanding.

1040
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,640
There were some misunderstandings going on.

1041
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,660
But, you know what's good to wow, wow, Wes?

1042
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:56,020
There were some misunderstandings going around.

1043
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:00,880
But I still believe that you too can be really good friends

1044
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:16,280
Like I believe it you too can still be really really good
friends Despite some misunderstandings Alright while these

1045
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:24,740
two play I have to talk about Zootopia 2 This is spoiler
warning So I yesterday I went to see Zootopia 2 And the

1046
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:27,540
thing It's just a little misunderstanding.

1047
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:31,040
But, like, I didn't realize that it came out.

1048
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,300
The opening day was actually yesterday.

1049
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,340
I thought, oh my God, y'all.

1050
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:36,300
Look at them.

1051
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:37,120
Howdy, partner.

1052
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:38,980
Why do you all cats?

1053
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:41,780
Oh, look, he's sick of being.

1054
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:42,880
Aw.

1055
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:45,980
Look at that.

1056
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,040
Aw, you're so tired.

1057
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:49,120
You're so tired.

1058
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:53,180
Okay, so I thought the movie came out, like, the day before
yesterday.

1059
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:56,140
And I bought my first podcast.

1060
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:56,840
popcorn bucket.

1061
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:02,940
I've never bought a popcorn bucket before because like, I
feel like it's a scam, but then I saw the popcorn.

1062
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,080
So, but I just didn't see it.

1063
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,880
Okay, I'll show you guys the popcorn bucket.

1064
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:12,620
I think it's just like pure capitalism and like, it's like,
usually it's like useful.

1065
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:18,700
Okay, but then, but then I saw this popcorn bucket and I,
and I get it now.

1066
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:20,500
I, I understand.

1067
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,000
So, then, okay, wait.

1068
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,400
But like, look at this though.

1069
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:27,920
Look at this little guy.

1070
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,540
It's such a big image.

1071
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,580
I'm trying to fucking resize it.

1072
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,260
Where did my image go?

1073
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:38,220
Oh my god.

1074
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,220
Where did it go?

1075
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,120
It's such a...

1076
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:40,360
Okay.

1077
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:41,860
Reset.

1078
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:42,420
There you go.

1079
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:44,620
But look at this though.

1080
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:46,780
It's so fucking cute.

1081
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:48,080
Look at him.

1082
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:48,960
Look at him!

1083
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:50,200
Look at this!

1084
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:52,580
It's so silly.

1085
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:54,240
It's so silly.

1086
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:55,600
It was $40.

1087
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:04,120
But it's not, it was $40 and I accidentally bought another,
I thought the popcorn wasn't included.

1088
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:07,300
So I was like, I was like this and a small popcorn.

1089
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:10,440
So I got like two bags of popcorn because I didn't realize.

1090
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:14,320
I thought it was the whole thing was 40, was like $40
Canadian dollars.

1091
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,680
So it was like 30 American.

1092
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:22,940
But, um, so they gave me this and I was like wondering why I
didn't think it was weird that I fucking ordered like this

1093
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:24,840
and also an additional popcorn.

1094
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:35,140
Because I thought it was like I thought you had to order a
separate popcorn to put it in the bucket So that's $40 for

1095
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:43,380
the popcorn bucket and the popcorn and I mean it's so
fucking cute look at it Every time I look at him by the way

1096
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:50,380
it was like why was it like a vip theater So like um so like
we had like these special tables and a reclining chair But

1097
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:58,620
like every like while I'm reclining this fucker was just
looking at me while I'm eating my popcorn uh wait why are

1098
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:07,440
you guys mad but he's so this also this guy was literally
okay spoiler this guy was like in the movie for 15 to 20

1099
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:13,600
minutes i had some like zootopia purist arguing me like
trying to argue with me in my comments but literally you

1100
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:23,400
didn't know i don't really reply to anyone um so um so like
people were like um he was actually in one third of the film

1101
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,740
i'm like yeah Oh, dialogue!

1102
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,140
Like, you can't say it.

1103
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:30,700
Okay, literally, this guy, he was just a plot device.

1104
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,980
He wasn't an actual character.

1105
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:37,680
Like, he wasn't an actual fucking character.

1106
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:44,500
He was literally a fucking plot device that was just here to
be, like, the plot, basically.

1107
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:55,220
So he had, I would tell you, he had five, he would have, I
remember, he would have, like, three to four would keep

1108
00:53:55,220 --> 00:54:07,940
repeating the same thing whenever he talks and like the four
lines would be i'm so cold um it's i'm so cold i want to

1109
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:19,040
bring my family home and and may can i have permission to
hug these are the three lines that he has in the film like

1110
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:23,340
and then the other stuff was just like

1111
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:42,860
And he was the fucked up part is that there is a character
in this film That had a bigger impact more lines more

1112
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:56,480
dialogue than this snake But he wasn't like scattered in the
promotional material and okay I will give spoilers right now

1113
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:02,700
I'll give you I don't understand why they have to pitch his
voice to I will give you guys spoilers right the spoilers by

1114
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:08,940

1115
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:18,660
had a bigger impact in the entire movie than this fucking
snake and yet they put the snake everywhere and then the

1116
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:25,140
purists were like arguing would be like um he was very
important in the movie i'm like yeah as a goddamn like item

1117
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:34,500
like he was barely a character you cannot tell me that he
was a fucking character in this film um he was barely like

1118
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:45,940
he was just like a plot point that's it uh because he was
very important to the plot but He had barely any actual

1119
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:47,140
impact to the film.

1120
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:53,100
Anyway, Zootopia 2 spoilers right now while they play with
each other.

1121
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:56,340
Okay, I should go to a world where there's actual toys for
them.

1122
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:58,800
They seem very, very bored.

00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:02,480
They're like, they're just so...

Spoilers right here.

1140
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,420
I really need a rant about this.

1141
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:29,120
Like, it's crazy.

1142
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,180
Let's see it.

1143
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:31,940
Zootopia.

1144
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:33,660
Topia 2.

1145
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:34,740
Spoilers.

1146
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:38,820
All right.

1147
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,180
Zootopia 2.

1148
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:41,760
Spoilers.

1149
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:43,540
Also, there's cockroaches in this game, too.

1150
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:44,580
If you leave the food out.

1151
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:47,020
For too long, cockroaches will start showing up.

1152
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:47,780
It's actually...

1153
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:49,640
That's why you got, like, bug spray here.

1154
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:50,900
Just to kill the...

1155
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,480
You can kill the cockroaches and stuff.

1156
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:54,100
But...

1157
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:54,620
Anyway.

1158
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:57,520
Okay, so...

1159
00:56:58,620 --> 00:56:59,020
So...

1160
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:00,120
Um...

1161
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:02,940
So there is a character in this film.

1162
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:05,880
That's played by Andy Sandberg.

1163
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:07,860
I didn't realize Andy Sandberg was in the film.

1164
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,180
I was like, whoa, Andy Sandberg?

1165
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:10,280
Wait, that's Andy Sandberg.

1166
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:11,100
It's really funny.

1167
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:12,780
And he hates cops, which is funny.

1168
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:23,880
because um you know he plays a cop in brooklyn 99 and so um
no one really thinks about this character because like uh

1169
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:32,880
because he's like okay so they he like comes in one third
and one third of the film um and it's like the plot twists

1170
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:40,680
are also like pretty obvious until um a very specific moment
Where you think, okay, he was, he is trying to help Judy

1171
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:42,940
Hobbs and Nick and the snake.

1172
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:45,140
His name, by the way, the snake's name is Gary the snake.

1173
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:49,320
Yes, his last name is the snake.

1174
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:54,400
Spelled with D-E, like French way with a, with like an
accent on the E.

1175
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:56,120
So it's D-E snake.

1176
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:57,520
Gary the snake.

1177
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:01,700
That's his name.

1178
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,120
It's not like, you know, Judy Hobbs, her name is first name,
Judy, last name Hobbs.

1179
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:07,220
It's not Judy Rabbit.

1180
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:08,780
It's Judy Hopps.

1181
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:19,940
so, the thing about Annie Sandberg's character, his name is
Paubert, by the way.

1182
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:21,020
Yes, I know.

1183
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:22,400
The names are getting very creative.

1184
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:26,960
So, his name is Paubert, and he's like a Snow Lynx, so,
like, a snow cat.

1185
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:32,940
And we all think, like, that he's, like, a good guy,
because, like, the Lynx family is, like, the villains.

1186
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:35,480
And, like, Paubert is, like, the...

1187
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:44,640
neglected son basically he's a neglected son and like all
the entire family thinks he's a disappointment so um we all

1188
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:51,880
think that he's there to help everyone which by the way like
i said he has a bigger fucking impact in the entire

1189
00:58:51,880 --> 00:59:02,600
storyline than gary the snake because in the end plot twist
he was actually a twist villain and i'm like fucking hell

1190
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:07,640
it's been 10 years disney I don't care about twist villains.

1191
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:14,540
Please just give me a fucking villain that's evil at the
beginning and is still evil.

1192
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,220
Like I don't care.

1193
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:20,380
So he turns out to be an actual bad person.

1194
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:28,140
It's another goddamn twist villain because they're like,
they're like, oh my god, we're gonna save the day.

1195
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:31,120
And then Pobrick comes out and was like, plot twist.

1196
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:39,020
And it stabs Judy with fucking He's like, sorry, I just want
to fit in with my family.

1197
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:41,940
And then Judy was like, you don't have to fit in with your
family.

1198
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:43,740
You can be your own person.

1199
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:50,100
And then Annie Sandberg was like, no, I'd rather be, I'd
rather be part of my family.

1200
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,260
And I'm like, are you fucking kidding me?

1201
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:54,100
Why can't, like, I don't care.

1202
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:57,920
I don't want to fucking sympathize with him.

1203
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:01,820
Like, they don't need a motive to be a villain.

1204
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,860
Why can't they just be evil for the sake of being evil?

1205
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,040
Why can't we have a village that just enjoys killing
children?

1206
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:16,080
I don't understand like Yeah, I deleted because that was an
actual fucking spoiler I tweeted about it.

1207
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:23,700
I deleted it right after I was like no That's just that's
that's a huge spoiler and so so I that like that like ruined

1208
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:34,100
it for me because That actually like Ruined it for me
because I'm so fucking tired also we're gonna leave the

1209
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:42,220
kitchen because they're board of the kitchen now I was so
fucking tired of twist villains because the most iconic

1210
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:50,500
Disney villains were like actual fucking evil characters
because like you know Scar he wasn't misunderstood or

1211
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:55,800
anything like I don't fucking care I don't want I don't care
I don't care your villain is misunderstood I don't fucking

1212
01:00:55,800 --> 01:01:03,660
care I just want you to be like I don't you don't don't you
don't have to make them redeemable too like just let them be

1213
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:12,040
evil like all the most iconic disney villains they're just
evil they don't care like we'll never i feel like it's been

1214
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:19,060
10 plus years they've been doing it for since frozen they're
like whoa frozen was such a popular movie because hans was a

1215
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:25,660
twist villain they literally did the hans thing for the
zutopia 2 villain and i was so they did the same thing

1216
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:32,380
zutopia 1 was also a twist villain that didn't make fucking
sense zutopia 2 they also made another twist villain i was

1217
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:42,080
just like are you fucking kidding me that's so i'm so tired
of this like and it was like there was like no hints there

1218
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:48,180
was zero hints by the way because like you know how like a
good twist villain they'll have hints that oh maybe they're

1219
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:56,440
evil they're just like and he like basically adi samper's
character did so many good things and then literally Judy

1220
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:01,660
was like, oh, I was so scared because usually there's a
twist and then bam, venom.

1221
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:03,800
And then he's like, this is the twist.

1222
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:06,520
And I was like, are you fucking kidding me?

1223
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:08,540

What the, what do you, what?

1229
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:25,040
The fact that he had to say it out loud.

that this is the twist i'm like bro like there's not even
any like like subtly to this either yeah there was no

1231
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:52,580
subtlety to it um so um so i was so tired because it's a
pattern they've done this so many times and like so i swear

1232
01:02:52,580 --> 01:03:00,500
to god i cannot remember an actual good villain that disney
has done um in like so long because they keep doing twist

1233
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:08,600
villains and like they keep doing twist villains or villains
that are misunderstood and i'm like bro like i don't care i

1234
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:15,940
like a good villain is not misunderstood they're just
fucking evil and that's what's fun about it that's like the

1235
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:20,180
fact that they're evil and irredeemable is what makes them
very fun like

Have you seen this sentence?

1242
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:32,080
Do you think those twist villains will fit on the aisle of
the last?

1243

Thank you.

Thank you.

1246
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:39,500
Um, yeah, a good villain is just evil for the fucking sake
of being evil.

1247
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:41,880
And so, like, and also, okay.

1248
01:03:42,140 --> 01:03:43,380
And this letter thing.

1249
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,020
Um, Judy, Judy Hawk.

1250
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:47,320
Okay.

1251
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:48,740
About the rabbit and the fox.

1252
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:51,400
I swear to God.

1253
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:56,900
Um, I swear to God.

1254
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,100
They did everything but kiss.

1255
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,280
There was one moment in the film.

1256
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:05,920
But anyway, in the end, they were like, I love you.

1257
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,300
And then she was like, I love you too.

1258
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:09,580
And then they hug.

1259
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:12,740
I was just like, I am fucking kidding.

1260
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:17,140
I was like, bro, bro, like they're still, oh, they're just
really good friends.

1261
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:17,660
I see.

1262
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:18,600
I see.

1263
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:22,300
They were, they were cowards.

1264
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:24,880
They were literally one moment in the film.

1265
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:32,540
Nick sees Judy, um, the rabbit, the fox sees the, okay, I
would say for those who don't know Nate, the fox sees the

1266
01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:37,480
rabbit, like, in, like, a gala dress, and he was like, oh.

1267
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,560
Like, he literally did that!

1268
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:45,480
He was like, like, checking her out, and, like, I was like,
that is not subtle.

1269
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:48,020
That is not fucking subtle.

1270
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:51,760
Are you trying to tell me that they're not into each other?

1271
01:04:55,180 --> 01:05:00,580
And then, and then Judy, the rabbit, like, yeah, just
friends things.

1272
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:01,280
I know, right?

1273
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,140
That's just a haunting instinct.

1274
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:06,480
And then the rabbit, she bumps into Addie Sandberg's
character.

1275
01:05:07,060 --> 01:05:09,560
Obviously, like, you know, like, Addie Sandberg's character
is a predator.

1276
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,660
And then, um, and then they were, like, flirting a little
bit.

1277
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:16,940
And then it shows a scene where Nick was, like, what the,
like, jealous.

1278
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:17,880
He's like, what the fuck?

1279
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:19,060
Like, he was jealous.

1280
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:21,300
He was so obviously jealous.

1281
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:27,820
And I'm like, this is, I, they gave us, it was like, I
tweeted up, I replied to someone, they're like, no, there's

1282
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:28,140
no crust.

1283
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:29,200
I was like, no, you don't understand.

1284
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:31,800
It was like a five-course dinner.

1285
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:35,160
Like, it was like a five-course Michelin-star dinner.

1286
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:37,900
And then the waiter came up and was like, you can't eat
that.

1287
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:39,680
Like, that's how it felt for me.

1288
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:49,440
I was like, there's no way that there, I was like, there's
no way that, that there's not, you're not laying them hook

1289
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:49,740
up.

1290
01:05:50,060 --> 01:05:51,420
Just let them kiss.

1291
01:05:51,620 --> 01:05:52,220
Just let them kiss.

1292
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:52,840
I don't care.

1293
01:05:53,200 --> 01:06:02,360
I, Like it's just a slow burn dokey Um, they're gonna hook
up in the third film and I'm like bro like

1294
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:09,930
It's such a fucking slow burn And I okay, here you go.

Here you go.

1296
01:06:10,650 --> 01:06:11,330
This is a spoiler.

I'll show you guys I literally this it popped up in my for
you page and like like look at don't look at this scene And

they're like they're just friends

1299
01:06:29,350 --> 01:06:36,750
It's the slowest Because they're like You gotta wait until
the third movie Doki and the third movie They'll finally

1300
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:44,390
hook up And I'm like Oh my god These people have to wait 10
years To see a rabbit and a fox hook up Like I'm like Bro

1301
01:06:44,970 --> 01:06:55,550
These kids that don't fucking know what was going on And
they waited 10 years For a fox and a rabbit They have to

1302
01:06:55,550 --> 01:07:06,650
wait fucking 10 years for them to make their abomination
babies like they are starving they're like actual cowards

1303
01:07:06,650 --> 01:07:12,790
they're like what the fuck do we do like interspecies babies
like what the fuck they're doing with the animals like with

1304
01:07:12,790 --> 01:07:22,590
the baby animals and the most like the most one of the most
fucked up part about it is that in the beginning of the film

1305
01:07:22,590 --> 01:07:33,650
they pretended to be a married like it was just like they're
like this is what you can have like like they're like they

1306
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:40,350
actually did like a fucking like they actually pretended to
be a married couple of a child for like an for like a bust

1307
01:07:40,350 --> 01:07:47,910
for like an operation bust and i'm like bro oh my god this
is this like i don't care i don't care about the ship but

1308
01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:58,290
you don't understand like this entire movie this entire
fucking movie was them hard baiting Judy and Nick as a

1309
01:07:58,290 --> 01:08:06,150
couple like I swear to God I I was just like bro just
fucking kiss I don't care like I don't even care about you

1310
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:16,750
two as a couple it was just that infuriating because because
like it was in your face like no you don't understand it was

1311
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:25,050
literally in your face for 80% of movie about the fact that
they're they're flirt they're hard flirting with each other

1312
01:08:25,050 --> 01:08:35,610
but they're not he they're not a couple I don't understand I
that's what pisses me off the most is because they just kept

1313
01:08:35,610 --> 01:08:46,910
they kept showing it all the flirting all the fucking
tension and then they're like hug they're just really good

1314
01:08:46,910 --> 01:08:57,290
friends and that's what infuriates me the most that oh no
another hairball dragon what the fuck hey dad i got another

1315
01:08:57,290 --> 01:09:08,710
toy for you what are you doing oh he's so tired he's so
sleepy they're just really good friends and it just

1316
01:09:13,490 --> 01:09:21,010
So, so that's how I felt about, that's how I felt about
Zootopia 2.

1317
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:23,030
That's how I felt about it.

1318
01:09:25,470 --> 01:09:28,190
I just, just let them kiss.

1319
01:09:28,410 --> 01:09:29,070
I don't care.

1320
01:09:29,310 --> 01:09:30,830
Just let them kiss.

So, what you're saying is, they're just really platonic best
good friends in the whole wide world yeah yeah I just there

1326
01:09:49,870 --> 01:09:57,070
was just no payout I felt like I watched these two
characters like do everything a couple would do and then the

1327
01:09:57,070 --> 01:10:07,030
fact at the end they're just like really good friends it
just pisses me off like I'm just like at least I don't know

1328
01:10:07,030 --> 01:10:09,970

1338
01:10:56,990 --> 01:11:01,710
told that they're really good friends guys they're really
good friends

1339
01:11:08,210 --> 01:11:10,530
They're really good friends

1340
01:11:14,510 --> 01:11:31,690
And this is the moment where it's like I didn't want to lose

01:11:31,690 --> 01:11:39,810

There's no way!

1342
01:11:42,770 --> 01:11:44,210
Very, very platonic.

01:11:45,590 --> 01:11:48,230
Very, very fucking platonic.

1344
01:11:52,150 --> 01:11:53,430
Alright, anyway.

1345
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:54,670

1346
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:55,890
Sorry, I'm calm now.

01:11:56,550 --> 01:11:58,690

Thank you, Super Chat.

1350
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:02,190
Thank you.

1351
01:12:02,190 --> 01:12:05,990
We'll get the non-twist villains when the Zootopia comic
gets it down.

1352
01:12:06,290 --> 01:12:06,990
Oh my god.

1353
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:08,190
Thank you, the Super Chat.

1354
01:12:08,210 --> 01:12:09,470
Thank you, thank you.

1355
01:12:10,170 --> 01:12:17,290
And yeah, anyway, so all those Utopia fans were arguing
about how they're like, yeah, because it's a slow burn.

1356
01:12:17,610 --> 01:12:25,070
So like in the third movie, in the third fucking movie,
they're going to hook up.

1357
01:12:25,270 --> 01:12:32,290
And I'm just like, just, we gotta wait 10 years just for
these fuckers to hook up.

1358
01:12:32,630 --> 01:12:35,370
Also, here's the jealousy scene for those who are wondering.

1359
01:12:35,490 --> 01:12:37,290
This is a scene where it was like,

1360
01:12:40,510 --> 01:12:45,730
There's a scene where Nick was clearly very jealous.

1361
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:47,970
Because what the fuck was that reaction?

1362
01:12:48,110 --> 01:12:51,910
Because he was like, why are you talking to another
predator?

1363
01:12:54,490 --> 01:13:00,710
It was actually the fucking the slowest of slow burns I've
ever seen.

1364
01:13:02,790 --> 01:13:03,530
Anyway.

1365
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:08,190
At the end, they confirmed.

1366
01:13:08,210 --> 01:13:15,950
that birds are real because everyone was always wondering
where the fuck are the birds he was just very concerned

1367
01:13:19,010 --> 01:13:29,470
so so in Zootopia in Zootopia there were there's no birds in
the film and people were like where the fuck are the birds

1368
01:13:29,470 --> 01:13:35,790
so at the end during the after credits you know where by the
way in the after credits Judy keeps playing the recording of

1369
01:13:35,790 --> 01:13:43,130
Nick being like I love you you and she plays it like four
times or some shit and then the recording was like i love

1370
01:13:43,130 --> 01:13:50,230
you i love you i love you and then like she walks away and
then a fetter comes in like a fetter falls down and then

1371
01:13:50,230 --> 01:14:02,510
everyone was like oh my god friends don't yeah love you as a
friend you know like they're just friends so like i swear to

1372
01:14:02,510 --> 01:14:10,190
god if the fox and the rabbit do not kiss by the end of by a
20 minutes of Zootopia 3.

1373
01:14:10,670 --> 01:14:17,950
I swear to God, I have a feeling that in Zootopia 3, they're
going to make everyone wait until the very end where, like,

1374
01:14:18,150 --> 01:14:26,150
I don't know, Nick saves Judy for the 20th, like, for the
20th time, and then she's going to kiss him, and then it's

1375
01:14:26,150 --> 01:14:29,250
going to be you have to sit two hours to get to that part.

1376
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:34,960
I bet you it's at the end, too.

1377
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:36,740
Like, they're not going to give it to you right away.

1378
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:38,060
They're going to give it to you at the end.

1379
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:38,660
Um,

1380
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:52,000
and it'll be a cheek yeah it's gonna be on the cheek too
because they're like we can't show that we yeah it's gonna

1381
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:59,460
be the cheek i wonder how the babies are gonna look like
because there's no in any of those utopia movies they have

1382
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:07,520
never shown two different species together which i think is
also why they're scared they're cowards because if you watch

1383
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:17,680
the film all the couples are literally like the same species
so they've never shown like interspecies marriage in the

1384
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:29,660
movie so they're fucking cowards actual cowards yeah so i'm
most curious about oh my god dragon you're hitting the box

1385
01:15:29,660 --> 01:15:35,720
what are you trying to get what are you trying to get do you
want this do you want a treat do you want a brush don't

1386
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:41,700
worry here here So I'm curious.

1387
01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:43,680
I'm like, oh, look, he's dreaming.

1388
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:46,420
He's dreaming right now.

1389
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:47,680
Oh, look at that rat.

1390
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:50,960
He's like, what is this fucking thing on?

1391
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:59,780
So, so they're like, so they're like, what do we do?

1392
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:06,000
Because they fucking put themselves in a corner by not
showing two different animals together.

1393
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:09,560
Like, they actually like put themselves in a corner.

1394
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:12,420
So they're like, what the fuck do we do?

1395
01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:20,780
By the way, I need to let you guys know The dude, the fox
and the rabbit flirting Was literally like 70% of the film

1396
01:16:20,780 --> 01:16:30,580
This is why I'm even more pissed off Because like it was
just in your face 70, oh hey like It was 70% of that fucking

1397
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:45,360
film Like them flirting Had more dialogue than the snake
That's the saddest part them flirting had more relevance in

1398
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:48,000
the movie than the fucking snake

1399
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:59,790
but yeah anyway birds are real finally they're introducing
birds in Utopia 3 not really a fan of the newest Shakira

1400
01:16:59,790 --> 01:17:07,470
song I still like try everything more because it's I don't
know it's just like that was like the I don't know try

1401
01:17:07,470 --> 01:17:16,690
everything was much more catchy then please stop guys Guys,
this is why I have one pet In real life What about fish?

1402
01:17:16,890 --> 01:17:20,110
They eat fish Fish are not sentient for some reason In
Zootopia

1403
01:17:23,350 --> 01:17:30,770
It's weird The lore around the whole Zootopia thing Is that
fish aren't sentient So they're like the act They're like

1404
01:17:30,770 --> 01:17:37,630
the food Basically everyone just eats fish In Zootopia
Because Stop!

1405
01:17:38,410 --> 01:17:38,410
Stop!

1406
01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:40,170
I put this up Guys, stop!

1407
01:17:40,830 --> 01:17:40,830
Stop!

1408
01:17:43,670 --> 01:17:46,810
No, dolphins are mammals, so they're considered real.

1409
01:17:47,230 --> 01:17:48,270
They have rights.

1410
01:17:48,790 --> 01:17:49,390
Dolphins have rights.

1411
01:17:49,770 --> 01:17:50,770
Fish do not have rights.

1412
01:17:51,230 --> 01:17:53,410
They're literally, like, they're food.

1413
01:17:53,770 --> 01:17:55,790
So then that's why everyone was like, what about the birds?

1414
01:17:55,930 --> 01:17:57,110
Where the fuck are the birds?

1415
01:17:57,250 --> 01:17:59,470
You know, like, that's why everyone was so confused.

1416
01:17:59,830 --> 01:18:01,930
Where the fuck are the birds in this movie?

1417
01:18:02,270 --> 01:18:04,790
And that's what, that's the crazy part.

1418
01:18:04,870 --> 01:18:07,370
I'm like, do birds just not live in Sutopia?

1419
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:10,810
Like, aren't they like, do they live in, is it like Wakanda?

1420
01:18:11,430 --> 01:18:13,650
live in their own goddamn country?

1421
01:18:13,830 --> 01:18:15,830
Like, what the fuck happened to the birds?

1422
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:18,030
Like, I'm so confused.

1423
01:18:18,390 --> 01:18:21,370
No, okay, so the reptiles are fully exiled, by the way.

1424
01:18:21,490 --> 01:18:22,950
They're like, reptile, bad.

1425
01:18:23,050 --> 01:18:25,350
That's why you don't have reptiles in the first movie.

1426
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:32,070
So, like, but then, like, that makes, that, like, there's a
whole plot line about it, because they're like, one reptile

1427
01:18:32,070 --> 01:18:33,070
murdered someone.

1428
01:18:33,190 --> 01:18:36,510
And I'm like, yeah, but mammals murder people all the time.

1429
01:18:36,610 --> 01:18:38,470
Like, that's what predators are.

1430
01:18:38,750 --> 01:18:39,590
I'm like, what?

1431
01:18:39,710 --> 01:18:43,250
So, that's the thing that That's the thing that confuses me
the most.

1432
01:18:43,530 --> 01:18:49,650
So the reason why reptiles are banned from Zootopia is
because there was one reptile murder.

1433
01:18:50,090 --> 01:18:52,630
And it was a reptile on reptile murder, too.

1434
01:18:52,990 --> 01:18:56,550
So a snake murdered a turtle.

1435
01:18:57,070 --> 01:19:01,450
And then because of that, all reptiles are banned from
Zootopia.

1436
01:19:02,650 --> 01:19:04,490
But I'm just thinking.

1437
01:19:05,010 --> 01:19:06,310
So like, what?

1438
01:19:06,410 --> 01:19:11,410
That was the only murder that's ever happened in Zootopia.

1439
01:19:11,430 --> 01:19:20,850
And I'm like, what if a fucking, I don't know, a lion
murdered a gazelle because it's a carnivore killing a prey?

1440
01:19:21,350 --> 01:19:27,350
Like, so I'm like, there's only been one murder?

1441
01:19:27,730 --> 01:19:28,310
Like,

1442
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:33,910
so, yeah, collective punishment.

1443
01:19:34,390 --> 01:19:41,410
So it's like, because of this one murder from a reptile, all
reptiles are now bad.

1444
01:19:41,430 --> 01:19:54,030
from Zootopia like I was I'm that was like the biggest like
confusion for me because I was just like so there was never

1445
01:19:54,030 --> 01:20:11,690
a murder since like I got one murder segregation right there
and I'm like I was so confused so then I'm like I'm What

1446
01:20:11,690 --> 01:20:15,490
about, like, were there no mammals killing other mammals?

1447
01:20:16,190 --> 01:20:25,050
Like, like, anyway, so, so now I'm wondering, how the fuck
are they gonna explain the missing birds?

1448
01:20:25,230 --> 01:20:27,150
Are birds just super racist?

1449
01:20:27,690 --> 01:20:30,490
Like, I don't know how, like, they just wrote them in the
corner.

1450
01:20:30,970 --> 01:20:33,810
Why didn't they just include all types of species?

1451
01:20:34,250 --> 01:20:37,530
Like, you don't even have to, like, include all the
reptiles.

1452
01:20:37,630 --> 01:20:41,410
If they put in Zootopia 1, like, some reptiles.

1453
01:20:41,430 --> 01:20:50,890
in there then people will be fine I'm like why are the birds
not there like they're too busy flying yeah birds have a

1454
01:20:50,890 --> 01:20:55,790
utopia in the sky and no one else is invited like

1455
01:21:00,470 --> 01:21:07,710
they don't mention that too because they'll be like utopias
for everyone except for reptiles and birds apparently uh

1456
01:21:11,370 --> 01:21:17,190
golden thank you for the super chat thank you thank you
anyway that's really all i wanted is that's that's

1457
01:21:17,190 --> 01:21:27,810

with the film um i know what about the sheep that try to

1458
01:21:27,810 --> 01:21:38,690
frame all predators i know but yet they didn't ban the sheep
they didn't exile the sheep from zootopia they're like yeah

1459
01:21:38,690 --> 01:21:48,350
no she's just crazy but i'm like yeah so what about the
fucking reptiles like you fucking exiled all reptiles for

1460
01:21:48,350 --> 01:21:56,210

1461
01:22:00,530 --> 01:22:07,630

Doki, it's a kid's movie.

1464
01:22:12,390 --> 01:22:15,330
Yeah, they both let the rabbit and fox kiss.

1465
01:22:16,550 --> 01:22:20,930

rate the movie a different rating, but then I got the

1599
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:11,120
You are not the father.

1600
01:34:12,300 --> 01:34:13,880
I don't need a test.

1601
01:34:13,980 --> 01:34:16,220
I just used my eyes.

1602
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:20,680

01:34:20,740 --> 01:34:21,020

Another thing I want to talk about.

1605
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:24,140
This is a nice Datsudon game.

1606
01:34:24,340 --> 01:34:25,360
Because, like, it's just like.

1607

1610
01:34:29,100 --> 01:34:31,940
But because the ring leader is looking at him.

And he's like, wait.

01:34:33,700 --> 01:34:35,440

1613
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:37,480
Don't wait.

1614
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:38,780
How will we get some toys?

1615
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:40,360

1616
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:41,080

1617
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:41,540
Look at that!

1618
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:44,340
How do I...

1619
01:34:44,980 --> 01:34:46,780
How do I turn this plane on?

1620
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:47,340
Oh, there you go.

1621
01:34:47,460 --> 01:34:47,760
Woo!

1622
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:53,180
Look at that, guys.

1623
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:55,760
Spooky!

1624
01:34:58,520 --> 01:34:59,820
Look at that!

1625
01:34:59,940 --> 01:35:00,360
There you go.

1626
01:35:00,460 --> 01:35:02,240
Now you guys can bond, right?

1627
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:06,280
Here, you have some fishies, too.

1628
01:35:07,060 --> 01:35:08,320
That will help with bonding, right?

1629
01:35:08,380 --> 01:35:08,880
Oh, look at that.

1630
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:10,360
Oh, look at that.

1631
01:35:10,620 --> 01:35:12,260
But, uh, oh, Bubbles!

1632
01:35:12,820 --> 01:35:14,100
Look at all these toys!

1633
01:35:14,460 --> 01:35:15,380
Come on, bond!

1634
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,300
I require you to bond.

1635
01:35:22,300 --> 01:35:23,840
All right, and then...

1636
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:24,400
Look, catnip!

1637
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:25,200
Woo!

1638
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:26,800
Catnip!

1639
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:30,900
Something will work.

1640
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:33,360
Something will let you bond.

1641
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:35,260
There you go.

1642
01:35:35,660 --> 01:35:36,680
All the toys.

1643
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:37,840
Look, more catnip.

1644
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:38,600
I don't know.

1645
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:39,740
I don't own a cat.

1646
01:35:39,860 --> 01:35:41,000
I assume that's catnip.

1647
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:42,920
And there's a goldfish!

1648
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:44,060
Look at that!

1649
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:46,440

Yo, your son hates you too.

1654
01:35:58,660 --> 01:36:00,660
Like, I don't think we can fix this.

1655
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:03,200
I think this is impossible.

1656
01:36:03,340 --> 01:36:04,760
I did everything I could.

1657
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:05,700
Oh, there you go.

1658
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:06,960

1682
01:37:14,900 --> 01:37:32,040
so sad we have lost an icon today the randy marsh band girl
has finally taken down half of 80 of her randy stride i i am

1683
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:43,200
so sad it's like we lost a part of history today no she told
her dad to help her out no it's okay for those who don't

1684
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:45,820
know about the randy Shrine.

1685
01:37:46,260 --> 01:37:47,020
There was this girl.

1686
01:37:47,220 --> 01:37:50,200
It was, it's like the yellow dandelion girl.

1687
01:37:50,540 --> 01:37:52,780
Like yellow dandelion crayon girl.

1688
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:54,400
Where, what the fuck?

1689
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:55,880
Is there a sandstorm going out?

1690
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:59,600
Where like she's obsessed with dandelion crayon.

1691
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:04,280
But instead of dandelion crayon, this girl specifically is
obsessed with Randy Marsh from South Park.

01:38:04,580 --> 01:38:05,700
So this is her.

1693
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:06,620

soul to her room anymore and yeah an angel lost her wings

1714
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:35,520
It just feels weird to see her, like, not be the Randy Marsh
girl anymore.

1715
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,260
It's like the dandelion girl.

1716

01:42:29,270 --> 01:42:30,150
I have a plugin.

1750
01:42:30,830 --> 01:42:33,230
I have a mod where I can make them...

1751
01:42:33,230 --> 01:42:37,010
Like, okay, to have them have babies, you have to, like,
make them...

1752
01:42:37,010 --> 01:42:39,910
You have to feed them these love candies and stuff.

1753
01:42:40,430 --> 01:42:41,770
You have to feed them love candies.

1754
01:42:42,170 --> 01:42:44,650
Spray them with perfume all the time.

1755
01:42:44,970 --> 01:42:50,810
And also, like, give them this pillow, and then you have to
wait.

1756
01:42:51,090 --> 01:42:52,750
And I, like, I can't be bothered.

1757
01:42:53,150 --> 01:42:59,090
Like, so I have a mod where I just press a button and then a
baby comes out.

You understand?

1759
01:43:03,630 --> 01:43:05,490
We have to wait so long.

1760
01:43:05,590 --> 01:43:08,230
This is why I didn't realize you can make babies.

1761
01:43:08,630 --> 01:43:12,530
Because, like, I didn't realize that was a thing.
