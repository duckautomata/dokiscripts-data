8
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,580
I would have said yes to day two.

9
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:43,140
I It was the environment I was in because my team Didn't want to do day two, but I was like, oh, that's not good Let's negotiate guys

10
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,780

Okay.

23
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,200
Thank God.

24
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:16,080
I still can't believe we actually made it Oh, yeah, it only hit me for a couple of hours I just slept through it and now the sun is out!

25
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,340
Bro, he literally slept through Milton.

26
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,600
Oh my god.

27
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,880
He doesn't give a fuck.

28
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,260
He was like if it hits, it hits.

29
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,640
At least I'm sleeping.

30
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,180
He slept through fucking Milton.

31
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,600
Oh my god, like I think how I don't understand.

32
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,560
Isn't it loud?

33
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,780
Wouldn't it be like loud if a hurricane's coming through?

34
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,920
I don't know.

35
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:43,900
I don't know.

36
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,720
I've lived through typhoons, but not hurricanes.

37
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,580
So I have no idea.

38
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:57,880
Anyway, as I was saying, I still can't believe we made it today too.

39
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:25,120
I really did have like, I'm sorry I like, I don't know why I was like, there's no way we'll make it today too Because in my I feel like in my head I was like, oh, there's a lot of actual good teams there I was like Like pretty casual about it I assume we were really casual about it because none of all of us don't play Deadlocked that much so I was very surprised We ended up making it.

40
00:06:25,260 --> 00:07:07,540
I feel like if we didn't get like absolutely fucked over ping over ping as well During the the first game, I feel like I feel like The first game it would have been close to like something Sorry, I'm fucking dying Okay, I legitimately think that like the first game we had like an even out ping maybe something would have happened Something was not supposed to happen though.

41
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:34,720
It wasn't The thing is, it wasn't even supposed to happen We were supposed to get knocked out But we were just so in the zone and we were so in the fucking zone and we're like, yeah, let's just play the play Let's just let's just play we'll see how it happens and then what happened was that we fucking won Against an EU team too for the I feel so bad.

42
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:49,380
I was like cuz like I told them I was like, oh, yeah They're like, do you think you get to day two before and I was like, um Yeah, I'm pretty sure like I don't think I okay first off I said I don't think we're gonna make it to day two But if it happens,

43
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,100
we'll see

44
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:32,110
Guys I need you guys to know I played this was I calculated how many times I played How many times I personally played deadlock and I personally played deadlock like mmm, this would've been my eighth time playing deadlock This would this would that was my eighth time playing deadlock I was so surprised the show was able to do

45
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:45,510
I was very surprised with the things I could do when I When I did have ping on my side So, um, so I was like

46
00:08:48,770 --> 00:09:08,790
I don't know what I'm doing, but I'm fucking I think my favorite part I think my favorite was when I canceled the Hayes all and then say jam was like, oh it got canceled He did not believe in me enough to do that

47
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:17,310
He didn't believe in me, but I canceled it out of replay.

48
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,730
Oh Yeah, I was very unhinged.

49
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:38,270
Um, I Was uh, I was definitely I still am I think like when I'm sick I don't have because when I stream I do have like a Filter in my head when I stream cuz I'm like, oh is this too much?

50
00:09:38,270 --> 00:10:00,090
And then I'd be like, yeah, maybe I shouldn't say that But like ever since getting sick that filter has not worked in a while because like I'm too busy trying to survive Versus like don't say anything bad Oh My god, why am I so funny?

51
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:32,430
What's so funny that I make myself laugh anyway as I was saying So now I say every intrusive thought in my head that cut like in my head because usually I would you know, I don't say my intrusive thoughts too often, but Um But now now it's just flowing it's like literally free-flowing right now so like it's sort of scary It's sort of a little scary

52
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:51,130
Also, I realize um, oh my god, okay Like when we're playing that Dragon Ball Z game the sparking zero and the fucking the Vegeta great ape fight I don't realize that people were actually like, oh my god.

53
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,450
Did you guys know Bandai?

54
00:10:52,950 --> 00:11:04,250
Bandai actually made a statement Regarding the great ape fight and they were like, please it's okay to lower the difficulty He is supposed to be hard.

55
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:07,290
I beat him without lowering the difficulty.

56
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:25,150
I did it And Then if you were like, here's some guides on how to beat the great ape and they were like talking about combos and everything And but I was like I flew up I flew up and I just started blasting

57
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:44,670
And I started blasting I did not need to understand the control Oh, I needed to know is how do I cheese this?

58
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,590
Last thing I didn't need combos.

59
00:11:54,290 --> 00:12:05,730
I just started fucking blasting At least I just learned how to fly up and then I did that for the rest of my fucking

60
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:21,790
And Then I just kept doing it Even when my chat was like Doki you don't have to cheese anymore.

61
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:27,570
And I was like, it's too late You shouldn't have given me this power

62
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:43,230
This works that's all I can say it just fucking where I'm trying to find the tweet of of the I'm trying to find the tweet.

63
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:49,890
We're Bandai was like, please everybody you can lower the

64
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,230
I'm trying to find it.

65
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:55,690
Don't remember.

66
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:56,470
I don't know.

67
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:57,250
I don't remember.

68
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,010
Oh, here it is.

69
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:58,690
Here you go.

70
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:19,690
Okay Here I thought it's really I thought that was really silly I refuse exactly I refuse I Refuse to lower the difficulty cuz I know the moment I lower that difficulty Chat would never be the same You will all look at me differently.

71
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:21,850
I know for the sake of my pride.

72
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,910
I couldn't do it.

73
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:27,450
I Know you would all lower.

74
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:32,470
I know you would all look every differently if I did I had to figure it out

75
00:13:41,330 --> 00:14:02,930
So I had to and I thought that was really funny anyway, yeah Yeah, I'm pretty I don't have a filter right now and I'm saying every intrusive thoughts going in my head So like this is gonna be very risky for the next couple of days until I actually get better Which is gonna be hard because like I'm not giving myself actual time to recover full Cuz I'm like,

76
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:27,370
let me just keep streaming Let me just keep streaming cuz there's so many cool things to do this week But next week I'm definitely but next week I definitely have to chill out I'm gonna definitely chill out next week because Like I said From you know,

77
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,530
I afford so much social interaction.

78
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:42,830
There's been a lot of social interaction The last couple of weeks and I I want to I'm an introvert guys, I don't know I told you as many times I'm actually an introvert.

79
00:14:42,970 --> 00:15:03,970
I just hide it really really well But like it's also different because I'm talking to a screen rather talking to a person I'm talking to an ad like if I have to look at somebody in the eye Like actual eyes and then like hang out with them like that's different But like talking via the screen is like it's not yeah,

80
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:24,450
it's not the same to me It feels like I'm you know, it feels like, you know, there's like a barrier towards somebody so like it doesn't feel the same as like Interacting IRL, but I am an introvert even then even with the barrier So like even with the barrier in between me and people it still sucks up a lot of energy.

81
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:40,390
So So like I definitely need a recharge Yeah, you guys you guys I know like 5% of you guys are real and then 95% of you are guys are like bots, right like

00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,610
Oh, I forgot we'd turn on the music.

141
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:45,430
Did you guys see I that's crazy how Mr. Beast is like Does not care anymore about his reputation I don't know you guys saw but like He recently posted a video of him renting a movie theater To play talk to to play that that podcast of the talk to podcasts and then blasting KSI's music video in the speakers while eating lunch Lee I was like the fuck I was just like why like I'm like this is it's obviously rage bait like we all know that's just rage bait,

142
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,410
but like like I I just

143
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:58,850
I Don't know I'm just like why like you don't need a rage bait.

144
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,270
I don't understand

145
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:11,750
I'm like, why do you need to rage bait?

146
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,490

147
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:23,330

Did you really need to rage bait like I?

151
00:23:39,470 --> 00:24:20,350
Guess like I know something's like but the algorithm Doki the algorithm and Yeah, he's gone Downhill, so I I don't under I like I guess like any publicity is good publicity at that point but also like at the risk of his rep and he literally like self-destructed his reputation within within like Within like like three months actually His is yeah like within three months he actually like self-destructed he also I need putting music in bum bum But um,

152
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:23,430
but I don't know It's new.

153

00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,690
I'll bring up a little bit.

185
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:41,310
Yeah Anyway life is I feel like life overall has been really fucking weird like I said rage bait fucking works because look at like KSI a load and Logan Paul and Jake Paul They've literally done everything that you should never do as a social media influencer except for except for I know okay,

186
00:27:41,430 --> 00:28:06,310
this is like I'm trying to filter this except for one thing that gets you canceled forever like Oh, that's not true cuz dreams still exist never mind Never mind, I forgot you can't get canceled forever anymore cuz stream is still on the platform If you know,

187
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,710
you know if you

188
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:22,890
Okay, anyway anyway as I was saying as I as I was saying They've Jake and Logan Paul have done everything Possible.

189
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:43,170
We're like, you know, you should it do as a content creator and on so like, you know overall But they still have a platform So it's like it doesn't matter and I feel like people and mr Beast goes up to you and was like hey, you won't participate in a video to win like I don't know $500,000

190
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:47,870
it's still $500,000 Like are you like?

191
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:53,490
Yeah, he might be like a fucking terrible person right now But like are you really gonna say no to five?

192
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,770
Don't lie to me.

193
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:56,030
I know we don't have morality

194
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:03,350
Don't you think about the morals?

195
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:13,610
Like I feel like we'd all we're willing to take

196
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:29,070
We Take the money I Would actually well I would say no congratulations, you're you're literally the 1% right now

197
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:49,930
Yeah, like I feel like money is just like it's still $500,000 I I just realized like Okay, so like I went after like I was very curious.

198
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:55,030
I don't watch mr. Beast videos I find like I don't really care much about mr. Beast videos.

199
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:56,690
I think like I don't know.

200
00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:00,130
There's just something It's just reality TV.

201
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,610
I feel like mr. Beast videos for me.

202
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:10,690
It's just like Reality TV shows but like on a YouTube format, but it's like it's not to me.

203
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:19,370
It's not like There's no stakes involved that to me that like makes me engage To watch it.

204
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:24,170
So I just treated it less like I don't know I just never got into his videos at all.

205
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:31,370
Even when his even when his reputation was like, all right, you know Yeah, it's definitely feels very.

206
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:31,910
Yeah.

207
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:51,030
Yeah, it feels very Scripted and like, um, it doesn't feel very genuine to me I feel like cuz it's not it's not genuine it's all like his videos are all about like trying to get the most amount of clicks and Trying to get the most amount of clicks and viewerships and numbers.

208
00:30:51,250 --> 00:31:11,310
It's all about no, I mean as a content creator yeah, like Like numbers numbers numbers numbers is very important as a content creator But like it just felt so disingenuous sometimes like with what he's doing Um Like he knows the algorithm very very very well,

209
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:38,150
but like I can't I don't he doesn't have a Personality like and I remember I watched like an interview cuz I was curious there was like an interview from him and and he was like I tried to have no personality in my videos so that people Like what I don't remember what exactly the reason but like he even amidst that he's like,

210
00:31:38,530 --> 00:32:27,370
yeah like I try to do these videos to not have a personality in there And I don't remember what the reason was I think it was so that like he's like a blank page for the viewers and stuff so they can focus on the content itself Like yeah, he's can be like the self insert I guess like like the self insert so like audiences can like put them put themselves in In there in his place and stuff like that and like since he has no personality in the video You focus on the event he's putting through versus like what he's doing He's just like the host but even hosts have personality But like... He... I don't know I could never get into him just cause like he just didn't feel like a fucking person.

211
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:34,590
like like he just he just didn't feel like a person at all to me.

212
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,140
His style felt like a brand.

213
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,740
Like um like a brand in uh, like a fucking human brand.

214
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,620
I think that's like how I would describe it.

215
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,840
Thank you for the super chat.

216
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,140
Thank you.

217
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:52,560
Thank you.

218
00:32:52,660 --> 00:33:08,560
We're a mix between a dragon and a chicken did a chicken and dragon like I'm You have a donkey and dragon to can do it like Almost I mean, we're literally playing Shrek like It's called no, it's called fucking evolution you idiot

219
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:20,580
It's called fucking evolution, where do you think it where you think happened to the dinosaurs guys?

220
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:31,720
Alright, okay You guys just gradually turn smaller and smaller and smaller until that you're like a punchable size

221
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:44,080
The ice age I like to order three cases of The meteorite doki.

222
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,300
What do you mean?

223
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:58,200
Yes, but some things guys if a meteorite cannot destroy like everything guys If a meteorite could destroy everything then how did fucking crocodiles survive?

224
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:19,720
I don't know if you guys notice but crocodiles and alligators were part of the meteorite They were there Like what the fuck do you mean they live through it take buried it they That's different they were in the water.

225
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,740
Oh, yeah, and water and water dinosaurs didn't exist back then

226
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,660
But the crocodiles existed

227
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:51,880
You don't understand doki the crocodiles they came from the meteorite and took them took the dinosaurs out

228
00:34:55,860 --> 00:35:07,940
Then what cuz alligators just are smarter I don't fuck Why don't you ask your ancestors that like ask them why they couldn't live through the meteor, right?

229
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:08,520
Like

230
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,320
You're you are the worst, oh, thank you.

231
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:33,940
I hope that I'm not good at this cuz I I hope I'm not good at power washer So I don't have to do this as my real job The Megalodon shark it's still out there don't listen to them

232
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:49,300
But that's the thing no, it's supposed they're supposed to get smaller cuz it's like it's something to do with like global warming, too Wait, no, no, actually no global warming is making things bigger again.

233
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:54,040
No, sorry things are I Think is that is that it?

234
00:35:54,100 --> 00:36:15,280
I don't know if I'm getting it confused global warming makes things bigger again and like And like if if we don't stop global warming the bugs are gonna the bugs are gonna get bigger again Yeah, no, it's true It's true That's the reason why Oh smaller No,

235
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:15,940
is it not?

236
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,680
Oh, it's oxygen concentration.

237
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,060
Oh, okay.

238
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:19,540
Thank God.

239
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:19,920
All right.

240
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,400
No, okay.

241
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:20,940
Never mind.

242
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,240
So we don't to care about globe

243
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:31,400
That'd be really fucked up Yogi's only reason to care about global warning is cuz she doesn't want the bugs to get bigger

244
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:46,750
Okay Well, yes, no that the bugs are bugs are getting a week I care I care but

245
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:12,690
Anyway the because we have less oxygen I mean it's still connected It's still connected Cuz like I technically like technically because like we're like

246
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:26,290
Like, you know, we're losing the trees so we're getting less oxygen so things are getting smaller now So yeah, things are getting smaller.

247
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:31,470
You guys just don't have enough oxygen, I guess Am I is this the only thing I have there?

248
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:32,230
Oh my god.

249
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:32,830
It is.

250
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:36,910
Oh My god, this is literally oh I have other nozzles.

251
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:50,270
Oh, thank God I'll get the turbo nozzle Okay Yeah, yeah, never mind let me not use it what what is it is it That's 40 degree nozzle.

252
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,030
Is that bigger?

253
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:52,110
Oh, it is.

254
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:52,710
It is bigger.

255
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:53,350
Oh, thank God.

256
00:37:53,430 --> 00:38:09,190
Okay, that's what we needed We needed like more more range anyway But yeah, the more you know the more, you know, that's why insects used to be fucking huge I 70 I'm never unlocking.

257
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:12,450
I'm never unlocking Shrek Shrek's house.

258
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:22,890
I can't believe the first thing I have to clean is this fucking castle I literally only have done 7% of this Like

259
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:44,510
So me being smaller it was because yes, that's the reason you're Yes, you have found a new reason to blame for your height But they give us super chat.

260
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:44,910
Thank you.

261
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:45,650
Thank you.

262
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:48,010
Yes, you can finally blame global warming.

263
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:52,990
It was all climate change fault I can't believe it.

264
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:53,630
I'll never me.

265
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,330
I actually got out of the swamp.

266
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:59,230
I'll never make it plant more trees

267
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:10,970
Guys all I'm saying is that if you want to bring back the dinosaurs, you know what to do You know what to do.

268
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:23,650
Yeah, go that's that's what mr. B should have done You know He said like, you know plant more trees for the for the earth if he really wanted to plant if he really wanted to save The world you should have been like do you like dinosaurs?

269
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:25,690
Well, do you want to bring them back?

270
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:27,350
It's time to plant more trees.

271
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:29,690
So our chickens can grow back into dinosaurs

272
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:41,730
Dragoons fix the climate to make us big I Mean, I feel like was that law?

273
00:39:41,850 --> 00:40:15,950
I feel like anybody I feel like that's how you get into the zoomers heart and the children Really just be like you like dinosaurs There's a lot of dinosaurs like there's like also like dinosaur enthusiasts are like really really dedicated So he was thinking too small exactly yo trash He was thinking way too small because I feel like if you tell people it's not lying because it's technically true Like it's just gonna take like a couple if you just omit the information That's just gonna take a couple of millions of years People will do it.

274
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:20,170
Just don't tell them like how long it's gonna take to get the dinos- dinos back there.

275
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:23,470
It might take like a couple million years, but we saved the world.

276
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:25,130
Exactly.

277
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:26,670
It's great motivation.

278
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:28,930
Don't doki.

279
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:35,510
As long as it's in the fine print, you know, like the tiny-ass fine print, it'll be fine.

280
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:39,410
People love dinosaurs.

281
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:40,450
It's the only way.

282
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:41,250
Oh my god.

283
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:43,130
What the fuck is this graffiti?

284
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:49,090
I mean, oh, I actually watched the- by the way.

285
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:53,030
By- can I be- oh no, I don't know.

286
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:54,550
I- oh my gosh.

287
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:55,430
Oh, you're five.

288
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,170
You're like five years too late.

289
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:59,490
I don't think anybody wants to be Chris Pratt anymore.

290
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:00,470
I-

291
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:16,990
I - I - I- I- I - Thank you, thank you, Sharko.

292
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:18,890
I still- I can't believe it.

293
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:21,630
He got so much hate for those videos.

294
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:32,950
I feel like that hate wasn't justified, but like every- everything that happened to him now justified that hate that he received for doing charity- that's the thing.

295
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:44,270
I was like not really like, oh man, that's pretty fucked up, but like because of all the dumb fucking shit he did, like the hate was justified for the charity work he did.

296
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:44,670
Like, he did!

297
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:51,430
I just can't believe they got vindicated.

298
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:52,950
It's actually crazy.

299
00:41:55,810 --> 00:42:00,990
Yeah, all his haters feel so vindicated now.

300
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,440
Oh my god, this is actually insane.

301
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,920
I've never seen somebody fall off that- that quickly before.

302
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,100
Of everything he's done.

303
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:24,720
Like, he- he was like super untouchable and then- and this- for some reason he was like, I'm gonna team up with Logan Paul and KSI.

304
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,320
Like, I-

305
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,420
I guess money is money.

306
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:38,880
I mean, he is getting sued by like a million different corporations, so I guess he needed the money, but still.

307
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:57,260
I don't know if you guys know this, but yeah, he's- yeah, he got sued by more things because of his- because of the- his IRL- the thing is, he's trying to do I- He's trying to do IRL Squid Game, and like, I feel like he like missed out on the message.

308
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,640
What Squid Game was?

309
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:04,840
I- I- I don't know, that's- is that- is that something?

310
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,520
Am I crazy for saying that?

311
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:15,480
I- I feel like he missed out on the entire message of Squid Game, and he's literally trying to do an IRL Squid Game.

312
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:21,100
And like, he act- literally endangered people's lives for too many years.

313
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:29,160
Apparently a lot of people got fucking hurt for- for participating in the IRL Squid Game.

314
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:33,720
And like- like, he's- he's like banned in Las Vegas.

315
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:41,540
Um, in like a Las Vegas studio because he got more people injured for the- his reality TV show.

316
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,700
Which is- which is fucking crazy.

317
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:51,260
Sorry, I spent like- I realized I spent 30 minutes talking about MrBeast, but I'm trying to be relevant about current times right now.

318
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:55,220
Um, to IRL for IRL.

319
00:43:55,900 --> 00:44:06,700
Yeah, like, there's- he tried to contract some of the filming, um, some of the, uh, filming to some Las Vegas production company.

320
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:15,260
And then the Las Vegas production company sued- like, I don't know if he got sued by them, or like, they- he got banned from ever working with them.

321
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,000
That's what I remember reading.

322
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,100
Um, Angel, thank you for the super chat.

323
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,140
Thank you, thank you.

324
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:32,680
Um, hey Doki, as a Floridian Dragoon with no power internet, have some money.

325
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,740
Also, I was debating flipping off the hurricane.

326
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:35,920
Tell him to go back.

327
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,680
No, don't go outside, Angel, no!

328
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:41,820
Thank you for the super chat.

329
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,060
Thank you, thank you.

330
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,400
Angel, no!

331
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,900
Don't go outside!

332
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:49,900
If you're gonna flip it off, do it, like, against the window.

333
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:56,820
That's what windows are for!

334
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,280
Did I clean this correctly?

335
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:03,460
Oh, I'm supposed to clean the graffiti as well?

336
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:03,940
Oh!

337
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,080
Okay, that makes sense, actually.

338
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:11,500
I- I- No, no, that- that makes sense.

339
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,220
Okay, that means I need to change the nozzle.

340
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:14,560
Oh my gosh.

341
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,080
Oh my god, I can, like, lie down.

342
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,580
But why would I lie down when I can- Ooh!

343
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:22,260
When I can just, like, look down.

344
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:22,960
I don't understand.

345
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,460
Wait, there was- wait, tur- oh yeah, the show did!

346
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,700
But how do I change my nozzle?

347
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,560
Oh, I can right-click!

348
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:34,300
I don't have to- oh my god, this changes everything!

349
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:36,800
Wait, aim mode?

350
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:39,040
Oh my god, wait, this changes everything!

351
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:41,520
Wait, oh my god, thank you, tutorial!

352
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:42,860
Actually, no.

353
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:46,300
I can- I literally can just right-click and it'll...

354
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:47,280
Um...

355
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:55,140
Wait, how do I- what was the button for- Guys, what was the button to open the- open the, uh...

356
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:56,660
The quick select again, guys?

357
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:57,560
I don't remember.

358
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:01,060
Guys, what was the button to open the quick select?

359
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:04,340
I'm becoming stronger, guys.

360
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:07,800
What was the button again?

361
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:08,440
I don't remember.

362
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:10,640
The- the change the nozzle thing.

363
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:13,300
The fast change of the nozzle.

364
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:14,680
Is it not yeet?

365
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,740
No, it's this, but there was like a shortcut.

366
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:20,940
There was an actual shortcut for it.

367
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,260
Was it R?

368
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,440
No, no, that changes the thing.

369
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:27,080
Two?

370
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:28,500
Oh, it's two!

371
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:29,320
Okay, nice.

372
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,240
Uh... what's this?

373
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,060
Oh yeah, that's like baby mode.

374
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:35,960
Um, what was I using?

375
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,240
Was I using this?

376
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,640
Okay, this is faster.

377
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:41,080
To get rid of the graffiti, because you're stronger.

378
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:45,000
But yeah, I actually watched Shrek the Musical, um, on my friend's birthday.

379
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:51,080
Um, uh, cause like she, uh, sorry, he, um...

380
00:46:52,200 --> 00:47:01,800
He lives in New York, and I remember, uh, I remember like he like, uh, invited me to watch his, uh, watch Shrek the Musical for his birthday.

381
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,140
Live on broad- was it on Broadway?

382
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:05,040
I don't even remember.

383
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:06,220
There's so many ways.

384
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:08,880
There's like Broadway, and then there's off-Broadway.

385
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:13,980
I haven't watched a musical in a long-ass time, cause I haven't been in New York in a long time.

386
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:21,520
I think the very last musical I watched in Broadway was, uh, the one about pies.

387
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,300
I don't remember what it was.

388
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:29,760
I would like look up, and look up like, oh, like, best musicals of the year at that time.

389
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:37,800
Cause then, cause I would, I have to go to New York for like, conferences back in, uh, uh, university.

390
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:42,580
So like, um, for like academic trips and stuff in universities.

391
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:50,380
So like, I get to, I get to like, uh, you know, so since I'm in New York, I'll be like, oh yeah, let's, let's go fucking watch a musical!

392
00:47:51,180 --> 00:48:00,960
And I, I don't watch like the, I, I try, I avoid the classic, like, you know, there's like, you know, you can, there's classic like, like, Les Miserables and Cats.

393
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,140
Oh God, I watch Cats in Asia.

394
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:08,780
I remember watching Cats in Asia when they did like a world tour.

395
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:11,740
Um, Cats, or like, what was it?

396
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,520
Or Chicago, I don't watch those.

397
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:17,840
I try to go for like, I try to go for like, the newer shows.

398
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:25,500
I go for the newer shows cause I know the classics will always come back, you know.

399
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:31,560
Cause the show, the musicals are already like, so fucking old that they always bring them back.

400
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,480
Um, they always bring them back.

401
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:40,000
And then the original cast, the original cast will be like, you know, either dead or like, really old.

402
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:47,540
So it's like, you know, there's no point in actually like, um, I feel like for me, I could always watch those whenever.

403
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:52,140
Just cause they always bring back, they always bring those shows back.

404
00:48:52,260 --> 00:49:01,360
But a lot of like, the really good ones, um, of our generation, of our times, they never, they won't bring it back.

405
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:06,120
Like, they won't bring it back until many, many years later.

406
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:10,900
Um, and like, it won't be with the original cast.

407
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:15,680
So like, I usually choose the ones that like, are like, the current popular musical.

408
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:18,800
That are considered like, oh like, really good now.

409
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:22,560
Um, um, just cause like, the original cast is still there.

410
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,260
Um, you know, and I get to experience the original cast live.

411
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:35,400
And, um, and like, um, and like, you know, normally they won't even do world tours too.

412
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:39,640
Like, like, I know like, cause I got, I watched like, Book of Mormon.

413
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:42,440
I watched Book of Mormon with the original cast.

414
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:45,180
When, what's his name, Josh whatever.

415
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:49,760
The voice of Olaf when he was still there.

416
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,840
I watched the Book of Mormon, um, with the original cast.

417
00:49:56,020 --> 00:50:00,900
I watched the, that pie musical with the original cast.

418
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:03,600
I remember that musical, that musical was really good, I just forgot the name.

419
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,720
Um, it was like, at that time, it was like, really popular.

420
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:12,820
I watched the, um, um, what was it?

421
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:16,200
Uh, Hamilton with the original cast.

422
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:20,520
You know, when I said like, when, um, what's his name, Lin-Manuel.

423
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:25,740
When Lin-Manuel fucking first showed up, the audience clapped for like, ten fucking minutes.

424
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,680
For just, he was just standing there.

425
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,520
I, I just, I was like, really.

426
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:35,740
Okay, my ten minutes might be like an exaggeration.

427
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:38,920
But by God, it felt like fucking ten minutes of clapping.

428
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:49,840
Um, I watched the, um, the, uh, uh, like Hamilton with the original cast.

429
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,620
With Lin-Manuel there.

430
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:55,580
Um, and then I think, I know I did one more.

431
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:57,400
Oh, I did School of Rock, yeah.

432
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,360
School of Rock with the original cast.

433
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,220
Um, and the guy who played School of Rock.

434
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:06,020
It was crazy to find out that the guy who was in School of Rock.

435
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:08,060
I wish I could watch Beetlejuice.

436
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,500
I really wanted to check out Beetlejuice.

437
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:15,600
But obviously, like, you know, when Beetlejuice came out, like, um, I've been super fucking busy.

438
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:16,800
So I never got a chance to.

439
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,560
I think Beetlejuice is the one musical I wish I got to experience.

440
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,580
Yes, there's a School of Rock musical.

441
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:23,120
It's really, really good.

442
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:24,580
Oh, and I watched Matilda.

443
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:26,340
Matilda with the original cast.

444
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:28,240
Matilda is so, oh my god.

445
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:29,840
Okay, guys, I'm gonna get demonetized.

446
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:30,320
I don't care.

447
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:40,440
Okay, this is gonna be my second VOD in a row where I get demonetized.

448
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:41,240
It's alright.

449
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:48,280
Okay, this, I, I don't know why, but I really, I really, I really like this song.

450
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,680
Um, okay, what was it?

451
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,100
Is it, is it a school song?

452
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,540
Or, like, nani?

453
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:57,620
I think it's, like, one or, I think it's either of these.

454
00:51:57,860 --> 00:52:02,640
This song, I was obsessed with this song for, um, I was obsessed with this song.

455
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:05,240
Is it?

456
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:22,480
This, this was, like, the first music I watched in New York.

457
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:27,260
I haven't even met.

458
00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:39,230
A bit orangery.

459
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:50,370
Oh my gosh, she's so talented.

460
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:55,170
Got to be a little bit naughty.

461
00:52:57,330 --> 00:52:58,770
This wasn't, oh no.

462
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:06,530
I wish I was a singer.

463
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:08,490
I love musicals.

464
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:12,710
I think this is, like, the one thing, um, I mean, I could take singing lessons.

465
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:21,350
But, like, I feel like I'll never be able to sing, like, you know, like, at that, at that level.

466
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:33,550
But I do wish, if I could, if I could, like, remove one of my talent points, I would, I would, like, I would actually remove talent points just to be able to sing.

467
00:53:37,450 --> 00:53:40,910
Cause I fucking love musicals so much.

468
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:46,690
If I could sing, I would do musical karaokes all the time.

469
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:52,830
Oh,

470
00:53:56,950 --> 00:53:58,710
the next song is the one that I like the most.

471
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:00,010
This one is also good.

472
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:02,270
I remember listening to this in the next song.

473
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:14,130
That's strange.

474
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:30,640
That's not right.

475
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:34,080
It's not right.

476
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:50,840
I'm so sorry if this VOD ends up being blocked in certain countries.

477
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:57,660
I'm sorry.

478
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:02,820
I really want to listen to a musical soundtrack.

479
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:08,000
I tried, I was like, alright, Doki, today...

480
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:24,680
Oh, it's not fair.

481
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:40,960
I tried, I was like, I was like, okay, Doki, this time, this time, you are not gonna get a VOD demonetized, Doki.

482
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:45,400
You had, you already had a VOD demonetized yesterday, Doki.

483
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:51,420
You need, you make jokes about ad revenue, but Doki, you can't keep doing this.

484
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:52,880
I can't help it.

485
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:55,420
And then I'm like, musicals.

486
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:03,460
I'm just like, but like, musical soundtrack, though.

487
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,560
Oh, this one, this one, my favorite.

488
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:07,000
This is one of my favorite songs.

489
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:08,140
I just love it.

490
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:13,460
I can't help it.

491
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:18,260
I just want to share my love for musicals.

492
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,320
Says I'm a miracle.

493
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,540
This is one of my favorite songs from the Matilda.

494
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:40,080
The Matilda, I remember the one thing I loved about the Matilda musical was the, was the production design was really good.

495
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:44,420
Angel, mom says I'm an angel.

496
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:48,900
This is one of my favorite songs.

497
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:00,900
And then you guys don't know, they're doing the alphabet right now.

498
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:02,140
Like this.

499
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:15,940
Oh, my God.

500
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:20,140
Watching this, watching this live was so cool.

501
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:31,620
You

502
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:39,990
know what I'm gonna say?

503
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:41,750
I don't like musical movies.

504
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:50,190
Except for like, there's a few exceptions.

505
00:57:51,230 --> 00:57:55,130
There's a very, very, very few exceptions.

506
00:57:55,550 --> 00:58:00,010
I meant like, like, like real live action musical movies.

507
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:03,790
Because they don't capture the musicals quite right.

508
00:58:06,330 --> 00:58:11,410
Because I'm talking about like the current generation of musical movies.

509
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:22,570
Because I also, I really like the, I like Mean Girls the musical because I listened to the soundtrack of the original theater recording, Broadway recording.

510
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:26,650
And then the, oh, the movie version was so fucking bad.

511
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:27,530
I'm so sad.

512
00:58:27,850 --> 00:58:33,370
I'm so sad the movie version of, I hope Wicked is not that bad.

513
00:58:33,470 --> 00:58:36,490
I hope Wicked the musical movie is not bad.

514
00:58:36,570 --> 00:58:37,830
But like, I don't know.

515
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:40,130
I don't know.

516
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:11,900
It's the one where Aria Grande started dating the guy who was in the Spongebob musical.

517
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:17,600
That still blows my mind.

518
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:27,240
She fell in love with that actor who was Spongebob in the Spongebob musical.

519
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:30,680
And started dating him because of the Wicked movie.

520
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,760
Yeah, the more, yeah, you guys didn't know?

521
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:35,680
You guys...

522
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,260
Yeah, no!

523
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:42,860
Okay, okay.

524
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:45,200
Okay, okay, guys, let me play my BGM.

525
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,740
I can't believe you guys didn't know that!

526
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:49,540
Alright, so, okay, Spongebob musical.

527
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:51,200
By the way, the Spongebob musical is really good.

528
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:59,580
I watched the, I didn't get to watch the, that was one of the musicals I regret not knowing, not being able to watch.

529
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:05,840
Because like, the Spongebob musical is like really, really, really good.

530
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:06,920
Um...

531
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:15,280
And, and, um, and, uh...

532
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,600
Wait, she isn't dating him?

533
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:17,640
She isn't?

534
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:19,160
When, what?

535
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:19,820
Really?

536
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:26,640
That was debunked?

537
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:28,740
Oh my god, a complete timeline.

538
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:31,540
The last time I checked was like two months ago.

539
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:37,900
The last time, the last time I checked, when did they break up?

540
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:40,480
I was like, I was so curious.

541
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:44,220
Okay, I'm gonna check, okay.

542
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,740
June 10th, 2024.

543
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:51,060
Aria Grande and Ethan Slater take date night to the rink.

544
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:53,640
The couple was photographed at the Stanley...

545
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:55,640
Wait, when did it get debunked?

546
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:57,100
I literally looked up!

547
01:00:57,300 --> 01:01:00,220
I'm looking up the fucking timeline!

548
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:01,880
Like...

549
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,140
Oh my god, I'm literally...

550
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:08,280
Oh my god, the link was so long that it disappeared.

551
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:10,580
I...

552
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:12,840
Oh, speak sound!

553
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:15,060
Oh, there it is!

554
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:16,440
It was...

555
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,080
Alright, following the...

556
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:19,500
Okay, alright.

557
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:22,260
Aria Grande on the most disappointing part of pub...

558
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:22,780
September!

559
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,220
Okay, that was the...

560
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:25,280
I would did not...

561
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,380
I did not...

562
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:28,160
I did not look at...

563
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,600
I did not check on September, guys.

564
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:32,600
I did not...

565
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:36,700
I did not...

566
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:37,420
I didn't check in September.

567
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:40,880
The last update was in July.

568
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:45,800
That was the last update I saw.

569
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:50,960
I didn't realize in September, she made another update.

570
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:56,780
Alright.

571
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,160
Okay, I'm checking.

572
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:04,360
I've been pictured together on several occasions.

573
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:05,960
The two were pictured together.

574
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:08,160
Where does she say it doesn't...

575
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:09,420
Over the...

576
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:12,060
Where does it say that you're not together?

577
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,320
Where did it debunk?

578
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:20,480
There could be less accurate depiction of a human...

579
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,860
There's nothing that says they're, like, not...

580
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:25,640
Okay, no one on Earth tries harder or spreads themselves thinner.

581
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:27,300
This Earth would...

582
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:28,000
That's something...

583
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:28,360
Where?

584
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:30,460
After a couple...

585
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:31,020
The couple...

586
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:35,740
Confirmed their relationship in July 20...

587
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:36,620
It was!

588
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:42,530
I'm reading this right now!

589
01:02:46,970 --> 01:02:49,350
I'm literally reading this!

590
01:02:49,730 --> 01:02:51,150
It says they're a couple!

591
01:02:54,050 --> 01:02:57,370
To me, they'll always be.

592
01:03:01,350 --> 01:03:02,850
Oh my god.

593
01:03:02,990 --> 01:03:04,070
Okay, anyway...

594
01:03:04,770 --> 01:03:06,310
As I was...

595
01:03:06,310 --> 01:03:10,010
WHO IS CURRENTLY DATING ARIANA GRANDE?!

596
01:03:12,010 --> 01:03:13,970
What was this conversation?

597
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:17,010
Ariana Grande is dating the guy in Spongebob.

598
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:18,290
The guy...

599
01:03:18,290 --> 01:03:22,050
Is dating the guy who played Spongebob in the Spongebob musical.

600
01:03:22,490 --> 01:03:23,750
So this is what he looks like.

601
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:27,490
By the way, the Spongebob musical is...

602
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:29,470
I fucking knew it.

603
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:30,390
I knew I was right.

604
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:31,530
I was curious.

605
01:03:31,530 --> 01:03:32,650
Because I was like...

606
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:33,210
Oh my god.

607
01:03:35,110 --> 01:03:38,650
Look, I like to keep up with the news.

608
01:03:38,990 --> 01:03:41,250
This is the news I keep up with.

609
01:03:43,250 --> 01:03:45,470
She's technically dating Spongebob.

610
01:03:45,570 --> 01:03:45,830
Yes.

611
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:47,190
For those who don't know...

612
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:49,670
The Spongebob musical is actually really fucking good.

613
01:03:50,110 --> 01:03:50,510
And like...

614
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:51,850
Oh man.

615
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:52,750
I'm sad.

616
01:03:52,930 --> 01:03:53,830
I'm a little sad now.

617
01:03:53,890 --> 01:03:55,050
I can't believe...

618
01:03:55,050 --> 01:03:57,510
I let my love for musicals...

619
01:03:58,150 --> 01:03:59,530
Got me another Vaati monetized.

620
01:03:59,530 --> 01:04:00,190
I...

621
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:06,260
Because now I'm back to public domain.

622
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:08,100
Public domain VGN.

623
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:17,160
Anyway...

624
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,500
As I was saying...

625
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:23,260
I would highly suggest checking out the Spongebob musical.

626
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:25,200
If you like musicals.

627
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:26,620
Because it has like...

628
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:28,080
The most ridiculous...

629
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,460
The most ridiculous like...

630
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,700
People working on it.

631
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,160
Who wrote the songs.

632
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:36,260
What was it?

633
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:36,580
Okay.

634
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,000
So we have...

635
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:48,160
Yeah!

636
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:58,580
Yeah!

637
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:00,760
He did!

638
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:01,840
He did a song!

639
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:03,720
I think it was for Plankton.

640
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:04,760
Like No Control.

641
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:05,560
Spongebob.

642
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:05,960
Wait.

643
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:06,880
Who sang this one?

644
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:08,400
No Control.

645
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:12,080
Appears on...

646
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:12,440
Oh no.

647
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:13,240
It was from the...

648
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:13,540
Yeah.

649
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:13,820
Yeah.

650
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:15,920
It was from the Citizens of Bikini Bottom.

651
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:16,920
Yeah.

652
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:17,360
John.

653
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:18,140
John.

654
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:18,940
Yeah!

655
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:21,340
Guys.

656
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:21,660
You guys.

657
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:22,100
Yeah!

658
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:22,460
No.

659
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:23,160
I'm serious.

660
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,220
I can't believe it.

661
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:25,760
Oh my god.

662
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:27,400
He...

663
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:28,260
Oh my god.

664
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:28,700
Okay.

665
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:30,340
I think like...

666
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:30,920
Okay.

667
01:05:31,020 --> 01:05:32,440
You know what's even crazier?

668
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:36,080
The song he wrote for Spongebob.

669
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,920
Might have been one of the last things he's done.

670
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:39,700
Like...

671
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:40,620
After he died.

672
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:44,220
That's actually crazy!

673
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:45,280
Like...

674
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:47,520
No!

675
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:50,140
He wrote the song and...

676
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:52,400
He wrote the song and then like...

677
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,520
The song got released in 2017.

678
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:56,220
It got...

679
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:57,680
Like...

680
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:58,340
You know like...

681
01:05:58,340 --> 01:05:58,660
Post...

682
01:05:58,660 --> 01:05:59,640
It was like posthumously.

683
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:01,980
Like it got released afterwards.

684
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:03,240
After he died.

685
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:05,880
Like...

686
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:09,500
That's actually crazy.

687
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:11,520
To think about.

688
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:16,560
One of his final works...

689
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,900
Was that he wrote it for Spongebob.

690
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:22,060
No!

691
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:23,820
It's actually good!

692
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:25,440
The...

693
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,430
Like legitimate...

694
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:28,480
Look at the fucking tracks!

695
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:29,280
Okay.

696
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:30,080
I'm fucking...

697
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:32,000
I'm fucking giving you guys the links.

698
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:33,390
Look at the...

699
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,140
Look at the...

700
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,020
The...

701
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:38,220
Look at the...

702
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:41,040
The...

703
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,260
The...

704
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:44,120
The people that wrote songs in there.

705
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:44,940
It's...

706
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:48,420
Almost every song is written by a different composer.

707
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:50,980
Like a different famous composer.

708
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:56,460
Bro, they won so many awards!

709
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,380
That's also the reason why I wanted to...

710
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:01,260
Wait, why...

711
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:02,740
Why are they only nominated?

712
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:04,720
72nd...

713
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:05,380
Who won?

714
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:08,120
Who took over?

715
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:09,460
The fuck is...

716
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:12,340
Okay, let's see.

717
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:13,180
Spongebob.

718
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:15,600
What the fuck is the band's visit?

719
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:17,420
The band's visit beats Spongebob.

720
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:18,000
That's crazy.

721
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:19,140
I don't even know what they are.

722
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:21,320
I don't even know what that musical is!

723
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:23,140
Alright, anyway.

724
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:23,800
Back to cleaning.

725
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:24,820
Sorry.

726
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:25,720
Back to cleaning.

727
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:29,060
Guys, I don't think we're gonna make it to the swamp.

728
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:30,920
Guys.

729
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:33,620
Guys, I don't think we're gonna make it to the...

730
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:37,660
I don't...

731
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:38,480
I...

732
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:40,280
I think...

733
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:42,920
I think it's too late.

734
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:47,480
Oh yeah, the Krabby Patty collaboration...

735
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:50,280
With Wendy's.

736
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:55,300
I love how people are like, It's good, but it's just not the same.

737
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:57,680
And then people were like, Of course it's not the same.

738
01:07:57,720 --> 01:07:58,630
It's not made by Spongebob.

739
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:04,320
It was like, People were like, Oh my god, it's so lore accurate.

740
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:09,140
The Krabby Patty just doesn't have the same feeling Because it's got...

741
01:08:09,140 --> 01:08:11,680
It got like, mass produced by greedy corporations.

742
01:08:17,030 --> 01:08:19,010
Just a day single.

743
01:08:21,950 --> 01:08:23,470
Oh my god.

744
01:08:23,730 --> 01:08:25,090
I've never had a Wendy's burger.

745
01:08:26,350 --> 01:08:27,930
I've never had a Wendy's burger.

746
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:28,930
I...

747
01:08:28,930 --> 01:08:32,450
I tend to like, Avoid fast food in general.

748
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:33,010
Okay.

749
01:08:34,130 --> 01:08:34,690
Um...

750
01:08:34,690 --> 01:08:35,430
What was it?

751
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:35,990
I tend...

752
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:38,690
Yeah, I tend to avoid fast food in general.

753
01:08:39,350 --> 01:08:41,090
Except for chicken nuggies.

754
01:08:41,530 --> 01:08:43,070
That's like, the only thing.

755
01:08:44,190 --> 01:08:45,070
But I haven't...

756
01:08:45,070 --> 01:08:45,950
I haven't...

757
01:08:45,950 --> 01:08:47,110
I haven't had...

758
01:08:47,110 --> 01:08:47,670
I...

759
01:08:47,670 --> 01:08:50,350
I haven't had chicken nuggies in forever though.

760
01:08:51,050 --> 01:08:52,810
But I tend to avoid fast food.

761
01:08:53,230 --> 01:08:55,130
I've been like, Um...

762
01:08:55,130 --> 01:08:57,870
I just get like, Regular food.

763
01:08:58,570 --> 01:08:59,250
Because I don't need...

764
01:08:59,250 --> 01:08:59,810
I don't...

765
01:08:59,810 --> 01:09:01,310
I don't need things to be fast.

766
01:09:07,570 --> 01:09:08,470
But I've never...

767
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:10,010
I've never had a Wendy's before.

768
01:09:10,210 --> 01:09:11,330
I've had Burger King.

769
01:09:12,030 --> 01:09:12,890
I mean, I was like...

770
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:15,670
I had Burger King, But even then, Burger King has been like, Long...

771
01:09:15,670 --> 01:09:16,310
Long time.

772
01:09:16,670 --> 01:09:18,190
We have like, White Spot.

773
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:19,990
But like...

774
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:21,270
Um...

775
01:09:21,270 --> 01:09:22,790
But like, That's not really fast food.

776
01:09:22,830 --> 01:09:24,250
That's just like, A family...

777
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:25,250
Chain restaurant.

778
01:09:25,330 --> 01:09:27,750
I don't even know if it's called family chain restaurant.

779
01:09:28,350 --> 01:09:28,730
I...

780
01:09:28,730 --> 01:09:31,090
I don't even know if that's the right word.

781
01:09:32,450 --> 01:09:33,130
Um...

782
01:09:33,130 --> 01:09:34,470
Um...

783
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:36,630
But I haven't had like, Fast food in a long time.

784
01:09:37,210 --> 01:09:38,630
I just thought it was funny that...

785
01:09:38,630 --> 01:09:39,970
Wendy's got the...

786
01:09:39,970 --> 01:09:42,410
Wendy's got the Krabby Patty promotion.

787
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:48,090
Classic Millionaire Doki!

788
01:09:49,730 --> 01:09:51,090
So unrelatable!

789
01:09:51,710 --> 01:09:53,650
Yeah, like, I would order...

790
01:09:53,650 --> 01:09:55,410
From like, The...

791
01:09:55,410 --> 01:09:55,870
Um...

792
01:09:55,870 --> 01:09:56,310
The...

793
01:09:56,310 --> 01:09:56,770
The...

794
01:10:00,550 --> 01:10:01,230
The...

795
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:03,790
That you have to send in your like, Tax returns.

796
01:10:04,110 --> 01:10:06,870
And your bank information to get access to.

797
01:10:07,130 --> 01:10:09,930
And that opens up the exclusive...

798
01:10:09,930 --> 01:10:10,710
Um...

799
01:10:11,110 --> 01:10:13,930
Restaurants that only like, Michelin stars are in.

800
01:10:14,110 --> 01:10:16,910
Like, I know like, You might be like, Oh...

801
01:10:16,910 --> 01:10:17,530
Um...

802
01:10:18,950 --> 01:10:22,030
Why the fucking Lord Farquaad texted me about his day?

803
01:10:22,190 --> 01:10:23,230
I'm not your friend.

804
01:10:23,310 --> 01:10:24,050
I'm just a...

805
01:10:24,050 --> 01:10:24,770

Eat the rich and we're talking about eating.

833
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:55,110
We might as well eat the rich.

834
01:11:57,830 --> 01:12:02,510
It's time to bring back the only good thing the French gave us, the French Revolution.

835
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:11,820
Anyway, clean, clean, clean.

836
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:13,460
Clean, clean, clean.

837
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:20,320
Is there like anything else I can clean that's not eggs and dirt?

838
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:25,580
Like, why are they wasting such good fucking eggs?

839
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:29,820
Oh my god, why are they wasting such good fucking eggs?

840
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:34,880
Mr. Beast about to be Mr. Beast.

841
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:38,880
Can I complete the job with like 50%?

842
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:42,860
Oh, hey, look, there's like a bunch of Lord Farquaad's merchandising.

843
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:45,160
I miss classic Dreamworks.

844
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:52,200
Classic Dreamworks was all about like, like making fun of Disney, but now they became Disney.

845
01:12:57,660 --> 01:13:07,300
Shrek, I don't know if you guys know this, but like Shrek was all about like making fun of Puss in Boots 2 was really, really good.

846
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:13,340
It just sucks that, you know, they went back to the same formula after that, like...

847
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:23,320
I love Puss in Boots 2, not because of like Okay, there was only one reason why I really love Puss in- like everybody would be like, oh, the animation.

848
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:25,220
Was it the animation?

849
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:30,600
Was it the, umm Was it the way they depicted anxiety so fucking?

850
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:35,760
Okay, I don't know what that- why that was such a fucking trend?

851
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:53,000
But like, at one point in like- at one point, everybody was like, oh my god, Like panic attacks so fucking like oh my god this movie makes depicting panic attacks So fucking relatable and accurate ever.

852
01:13:53,140 --> 01:14:00,940
That's all everybody would talk about like everybody would be like Oh my god, this movie is good because look at how they portray panic attacks like what?

853
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:09,500
Like everybody kept talking about panic attacks in animation, I'm like bro, what the fuck like

854
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:20,900
Yeah, yeah, so like yeah, Puss had a panic attack in Puss in Boots 2 and everybody was like, oh my god That's so real.

855
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:21,980
That's so good.

856
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:40,480
And then and then every other Every other fucking movie start animation movie had panic attacks for some fucking reason People are like yeah Puss in Boots did it well, but did it do as well as like oh my god What was the other movie that had panic attacks like was it turning red?

857
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:44,060
Yeah, but what about turning red's panic attack, huh?

858
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:55,600
Anyway, anyway the reason why I really I really Oh, yeah inside out too.

859
01:14:55,740 --> 01:14:56,020
Yeah.

860
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:56,540
Yeah.

861
01:14:56,540 --> 01:14:59,260
What about like inside out 2's panic attack?

862
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:13,400
Like what the fuck like animation movies are not just about panic attacks guys It's not it's not the panic attacks guys, that's not what movies are about

863
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:49,520
What I love about About Puss in Boots 2 Was the fact that they gave us a villain that was just pure evil and I love it that like he has zero Redeemable qualities and he it was so fucking funny But what was his name Puss in Boots What was the villains name I forgot what was his name,

864
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:50,800
uh, Jack Horner.

865
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:54,800
Yeah, Jack Jack Horner I love Jack Horner, though.

866
01:15:54,860 --> 01:16:08,300
I think he is literally one of like he's like the best the The best villain that's ever been in a movie and I love I love everything about him And I just want more of that.

867
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:23,060
I just want a villain That's just evil and he has zero redeeming qualities and like like he has no reason to be evil He just likes to be evil for the sake of being evil You're a redeemable monster

868
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:29,000
He was like, how did you turn to be evil?

869
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:30,160
How did you become evil?

870
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:34,220
Oh, I just have a loving family incredibly rich like

871
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:50,560
You use this crap like that He's so relatable guys, he's oh my god Jack Horner is just so relatable and that's why he's my favorite character

872
01:16:55,340 --> 01:17:00,140
So real I

873
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:06,100
Think good locks was a fucking terror.

874
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:11,800
I had terror like terrible Villain, but it's alright.

875
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:17,640
She got she got What was it overlooked over because of Jack Horner?

876
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:23,640
I didn't like the Goldilocks edition of the story I feel like the Goldilocks addition to the story was useless.

877
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:27,700
I am Like I know she wasn't like the villain villain.

878
01:17:27,820 --> 01:17:32,240
She was like more like the what's the word then what Deadpool is?

879
01:17:32,820 --> 01:17:42,980
Um what's that word when you're not the antagonist you're the You're the redeemable Antagonist the anti-hero.

880
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:43,240
Yeah.

881
01:17:43,340 --> 01:17:43,540
Yeah.

882
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:43,780
Yeah.

883
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:44,200
Yeah.

884
01:17:44,240 --> 01:18:01,020
She was more like an anti-hero than a than a than the antagonist of the movie, but I just didn't feel like her addition to the Story was I didn't feel like her addition to the story was Was like it added anything.

885
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:04,400
I just don't think she added much to the to the movie itself

886
01:18:11,290 --> 01:18:55,230
Yeah, I just didn't think she added much I also like wasn't really a big fan of the voice actress Portrayal of her because I feel like she was very stiff Versus I think the the other voice actors and voice actresses were so good in The movie that like when she said anything it just paled in comparison She just was like she just wasn't as good as a voice actor as the other people in the movie And the Bears were good I like the Bears I think the Bears were good That's how I felt about Goldilocks other than that like Jack Horner was my favorite part All right,

887
01:18:55,270 --> 01:19:06,470
I'm gonna do it to give like a I'm gonna give like a Controversial opinion I did personally I'm gonna say it.

888
01:19:06,670 --> 01:19:08,030
I'm gonna say it guys.

889
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:10,010
I'm gonna say it.

890
01:19:11,770 --> 01:19:20,990
I I Watch Deadpool versus Wolverine and I think it was average

891
01:19:25,690 --> 01:19:32,330
There I said it I personally think that movie was just

892
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:59,330
I Just think that like there was it was just It was just cameo bait the movie

893
01:20:02,810 --> 01:20:08,570
That's all I felt about it I was like Oh, Jesus Christ, uh, what's his name?

894
01:20:08,650 --> 01:20:14,450
Oh my god, um, the guy who plays Wolverine, he's so fucking old now.

895
01:20:14,610 --> 01:20:20,590
Like, oh my god, he's so- Oh my god, he's- let him rest, please.

896
01:20:20,910 --> 01:20:33,630
Like, but also, um, but also the fact that, like, it was literally just cameo, cameo, cameo, um, Hey, you up- hey, you remember this reference?

897
01:20:34,190 --> 01:20:35,770
Yeah, let's bring it back.

898
01:20:36,230 --> 01:20:39,250
And, oh my god, what about this reference?

899
01:20:40,050 --> 01:20:42,150
Until he's 90, yeah.

900
01:20:42,430 --> 01:20:43,770
You remember that reference?

901
01:20:44,010 --> 01:20:46,950
Oh my god, yeah, from that other movie we had?

902
01:20:47,470 --> 01:20:48,250
Oh my-

903
01:20:51,310 --> 01:21:00,030
Yeah, I know Wolverine's supposed to be old, but he's not supposed to be, like, he's not supposed to, like, age that fast, if you remember.

904
01:21:01,370 --> 01:21:05,290
So, like, there was no actual stories.

905
01:21:05,510 --> 01:21:08,910
I think, like, that's basically the Deadpool formula.

906
01:21:13,570 --> 01:21:21,530
Like, I think, like, at that point, I should remember that that's, like, the Deadpool formula, where, like, you know, Deadpool is all about being, like, referential.

907
01:21:22,090 --> 01:21:28,610
And, like, um, current and stuff, because that's, like, you know, he's breaking the- he's breaking the fourth wall.

908
01:21:29,450 --> 01:21:36,150
And, um, and, like, he's supposed- like, that's his- but then, like, it's three times of the same thing.

909
01:21:38,430 --> 01:21:45,210
Like, you know, you know, like, the first time, you're, like, oh, yeah, that's funny, like, because it's, like, new.

910
01:21:45,570 --> 01:21:48,570
The second time, you're, like, oh, haha.

911
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:52,210
Yeah, wait, no, this is the fourth one, right?

912
01:21:52,830 --> 01:21:53,970
Or is it the third one?

913
01:21:54,530 --> 01:21:57,570
I already lost track of how many Deadpool movies he's made.

914
01:21:57,590 --> 01:22:02,110
Like, I already- I already- okay, third.

915
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:07,250
The second time, you're, like, oh, like, oh, haha, like, you know, back at it again.

916
01:22:07,530 --> 01:22:15,430
But then, the third time, I was, like, oh, alright, we're- we're back- back- I guess- I guess we're- we're doing it again!

917
01:22:17,270 --> 01:22:27,650
But we're even- but now Disney's involved, which I think that's also why, because Disney is also involved now.

918
01:22:27,850 --> 01:22:33,230
So, like, it lost a little- like, I know people are, like, oh my god, he gets to be in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

919
01:22:33,790 --> 01:22:38,390
But, like, I felt like it did lose a little bit of the charm, also.

920
01:22:39,190 --> 01:22:41,070
So, he is James!

921
01:22:45,410 --> 01:22:49,050
To be fair, I didn't watch fully the second movie.

922
01:22:49,670 --> 01:22:58,630
I watched the- I liked the first movie, because, like, I felt like there was more of a story in the first movie.

923
01:23:00,650 --> 01:23:06,330
The third movie, there was no story, I think.

924
01:23:06,330 --> 01:23:10,270
There was not no story, but a lack of a story.

925
01:23:13,950 --> 01:23:15,230
But, like...

926
01:23:15,930 --> 01:23:24,310
But Deadpool and Wolverine have really good chemistry together, which is, like, what's- which is basically what's, like, you know...

927
01:23:25,170 --> 01:23:28,070
What's, like, saving the movie in general.

928
01:23:29,030 --> 01:23:34,210
It saved the movie because of, like, their chemistry together.

929
01:23:34,210 --> 01:23:46,470
But I didn't, you know- I think I also got overhyped, because I saw so many people being, like, oh my god, it's, like, one of the- it was such a good- like, oh my god, it became the number one R-rated movie of all time.

930
01:23:46,510 --> 01:23:50,410
And, like, oh my god, it's still doing so fucking well and everything.

931
01:23:50,790 --> 01:23:55,550
And then, oh my god, bye bye bye ba-bum-ba-da-da-da-da-da-da!

932
01:23:55,750 --> 01:24:01,630
And everybody's talking about the, um, bye bye bye scene, which was only in the beginning.

933
01:24:01,630 --> 01:24:04,250
And then, um...

934
01:24:04,250 --> 01:24:10,450
And then every- so then I think I went in with the movie already, like, super hyped up.

935
01:24:10,530 --> 01:24:15,310
So then when I swatched it, I was just like, oh, it's- it's- it's just...

936
01:24:16,210 --> 01:24:17,950
It was just average to me.

937
01:24:18,050 --> 01:24:30,810
It's- I think- oh my god, the craziest part about that song being in the- I don't know if you guys saw that, but they literally renamed the song to be, like, um...

938
01:24:30,810 --> 01:24:32,810
What was the song- is it the song title?

939
01:24:32,930 --> 01:24:33,570
Bye Bye Bye?

940
01:24:33,770 --> 01:24:34,330
I don't remember.

941
01:24:34,490 --> 01:24:35,970
What was the song title for that?

942
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:38,130
Was it also Bye Bye Bye?

943
01:24:38,510 --> 01:24:47,850
But, like, they renamed the song- the YouTube link of the song- the YouTube version of the song to, like, be, like, Bye Bye Bye from Deadpool.

944
01:24:49,830 --> 01:24:53,850
Like, I was like, what do you mean from Deadpool?

945
01:24:54,370 --> 01:24:57,970
Like, that song came out 20 plus years ago.

946
01:24:58,570 --> 01:24:59,130
Like...

947
01:25:00,230 --> 01:25:05,230
Like, they literally renamed with the origin of the song.

948
01:25:05,630 --> 01:25:07,750
I don't know if they renamed it back.

949
01:25:07,890 --> 01:25:09,830
That's a joke, so...

950
01:25:10,550 --> 01:25:12,090
It's where- it's the clicks.

951
01:25:12,990 --> 01:25:15,910
They had to make sure people know it was from- it's the one from Deadpool.

952
01:25:17,950 --> 01:25:20,830
From Dead- by Deadpool from Fortnite.

953
01:25:22,710 --> 01:25:30,310
That's so funny, I can't believe they- That's so funny and, like, smart for them to do.

954
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:39,680
It's from Deadpool- it was created just for Deadpool.

955
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:44,700
Anyway, I don't know, guys, I think, like, everybody knows that's not actually Ryan Reynolds that danced to that.

956
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:45,340
He is not...

957
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:49,220
He's- he's, like, he's a good actor, but, like, no, actually...

958
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:58,060
Okay, I won't- okay, I said it before, he's not necessarily a good actor.

959
01:25:58,220 --> 01:25:59,960
He's just really good at playing himself.

960
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:07,500
He's not good at- he's not, like, the best actor.

961
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:09,800
He's just really good at being himself.

962
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:16,940
And he's at the point- he's at the- he's at- he's at the point where, like, people are okay with him playing himself.

963
01:26:16,940 --> 01:26:19,560
But at one point, he's gonna hit that spot.

964
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:29,460
He's gonna hit that juicy spot, the Chris Pratt spot, and Jack Black spot, where people are gonna get very tired of him playing himself.

965
01:26:33,870 --> 01:26:36,310
He's still at his honeymoon phase right now.

966
01:26:36,470 --> 01:26:38,970
People still like that he's playing himself, guys.

967
01:26:39,330 --> 01:26:50,120
But I bet you in five years, within five years, If- People are gonna be like, oh, another Ryan Reynolds movie where he plays himself?

968
01:26:55,130 --> 01:26:56,390
It's gonna happen.

969
01:26:56,570 --> 01:26:57,910
It's gonna happen, guys.

970
01:26:57,990 --> 01:27:00,850
In five years, guys, I can see the future.

971
01:27:01,330 --> 01:27:04,350
In five years, this is where it's gonna hit.

972
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:15,780
I can see his career Exploding, just like Jack Black.

973
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:25,900
If it can- okay, not- guys, I don't think anybody had it in their 2024 bingo for- for Jack Black's career to explode.

974
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:29,000
Like, I don't think anybody foresee that.

975
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:35,500
Like, if it could happen to Jack Black, it can absolutely happen to Ryan Reynolds.

976
01:27:36,020 --> 01:27:38,660
Jack Black was fucking untouchable.

977
01:27:45,380 --> 01:27:49,260
I Still like Jack Black, yeah, but now he's like a joke now.

978
01:27:50,660 --> 01:27:55,700
Which is something nobody would have ever expected, you know?

979
01:27:56,200 --> 01:28:05,520
Nobody would have expected that to happen to him because everybody was always like, oh my god, you know, like, you know, they're all like, oh my god, like, haha.

980
01:28:06,140 --> 01:28:10,360
Oh my god, he's so funny, and like, playing himself.

981
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:12,460
It's a casting problem.

982
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:17,660
It's- it's all about, um, the board members.

983
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:19,220
It's always about board members.

984
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:27,920
Board members don't care about- board members don't care about, like, what's an actual good choice.

985
01:28:28,260 --> 01:28:30,760
They just care about, like, money.

986
01:28:31,340 --> 01:28:32,940
Because it's always about money.

987
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:53,220
It's like how I saw that- I saw there was a tweet about, um, so, you know, like, X-Men, uh, the director that did the X-Men movies, the director that did the X-Men movies, and he, like, he did the first X-Men movie, and then he did- but then he, like,

988
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:58,220
dropped out, and it dropped out for the second and third X-Men movie, I believe.

989
01:28:59,020 --> 01:29:02,180
Um, and there was, like, a new thing came out.

990
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:05,400
A new, like, thing came out that got leaked.

991
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:26,080
Well, not leaked, but he, like, exposed something about, um, he exposed something about the, uh, like, you know, Hollywood and stuff, and basically, like, he was saying how, um, he decided- he was supposed to direct the sequel to First Class.

992
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:27,420
Was it sequel?

993
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:50,840
No, he was supposed to direct the third X-Men movie, and, um, and then he found out that, in order to get Hal Berry to play Storm in the third movie, they sent her a fake script, where she was heavily involved in the movie just to get her to sign the contract,

994
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:55,640
and then after she signed the contract, they threw away the script.

995
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:57,740
And gave her the real script.

996
01:30:00,700 --> 01:30:03,280
Yeah, and I was like, bro, that's fucked up.

997
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:05,220
That's so...

998
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:06,900
That's...

999
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,360
That's so fucked up!

1000
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:13,080
Like, that's illegal.

1001
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:15,240
Not in Hollywood, baby!

1002
01:30:16,460 --> 01:30:19,480
Cause they could just be like, oh, the script got rewrote.

1003
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:19,980
Yeah.

1004
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:24,740
They could've been like, they could be like, oh yeah, the script got, like, rewritten.

1005
01:30:24,740 --> 01:30:26,720
I'm so sorry, we have to cut your scenes.

1006
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:29,840
Like, your scenes became deleted and stuff.

1007
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:33,920
Um, so, and then the director, um...

1008
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:36,520
And then the director was like, I'm out.

1009
01:30:36,660 --> 01:30:42,720
Like, I, like, he was like, he found out, the director found out, and was like, yeah, I'm...

1010
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:43,360
I'm out.

1011
01:30:43,460 --> 01:30:45,720
I can't, I don't wanna work in those conditions.

1012
01:30:46,740 --> 01:30:48,100
Yeah, that's just Hollywood.

1013
01:30:48,380 --> 01:30:49,620
It's, like, super corrupt.

1014
01:30:52,400 --> 01:31:03,860
Yeah, cause, like, she never, she hasn't signed yet, so, like, it was like, you know, like, actors would get sent scripts and stuff to, like, you know, cause they're like, oh, I don't know if I wanna sign, I wanna look at the script first to see, like,

1015
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:18,260
if it's something I wanna do, and then, um, um, and then, like, obviously, you know, they send her, they, they try to send her a fake script so that, like, where she's heavily involved in the movie, just to make sure she signs.

1016
01:31:24,490 --> 01:31:25,950
Oh, yeah, is there a castle?

1017
01:31:26,170 --> 01:31:27,010
There's no castle.

1018
01:31:27,710 --> 01:31:29,470
Bro, I can't even get to the castle.

1019
01:31:29,930 --> 01:31:31,050
What do you mean?

1020
01:31:31,370 --> 01:31:34,350
I'm too fucking poor to reach the castle.

1021
01:31:36,270 --> 01:31:40,530
This is the poor, this is where the, the, the poor district is.

1022
01:31:46,570 --> 01:31:47,990
Yeah, thank you for the super chat.

1023
01:31:48,070 --> 01:31:49,270
Thank you, thank you.

1024
01:31:49,270 --> 01:31:55,230
Um, where SheHawkMovies was originally supposed to be in Deadpool 3, Ryan Reynolds rejected her, oh my god.

1025
01:31:55,470 --> 01:32:01,190
To be fair, I won't be surprised if, like, a lot of people wanted to be in that movie.

1026
01:32:03,230 --> 01:32:19,350
I won't be surprised, cause I feel like, you know, that's something that, that's something that, like, people, um, I feel like a lot of actors and actresses would wanna be in just for the sake of, like, they know it's gonna be a really big movie, and that it's gonna,

1027
01:32:19,350 --> 01:32:22,490
it's gonna do really well.

1028
01:32:24,270 --> 01:32:28,490
So, like, I'm not surprised he would, like, he had to, like, pick and choose.

1029
01:32:30,910 --> 01:32:32,630
The production looked really fun?

1030
01:32:32,810 --> 01:32:34,210
Ah, I can see that.

1031
01:32:35,070 --> 01:32:36,750
I can see the production being really fun.

1032
01:32:37,470 --> 01:32:37,830
Yeah.

1033
01:32:40,230 --> 01:32:41,810
How old is Tobey Maguire?

1034
01:32:42,670 --> 01:32:47,070
Anyway, I'm actually, oh my god, guys, let's age all of us.

1035
01:32:47,170 --> 01:32:51,490
Let's make you all feel old.

1036
01:32:51,650 --> 01:32:52,890
Oh my god, he's, like, 49?

1037
01:32:53,410 --> 01:32:54,790
Okay, he's not as old as I thought.

1038
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:56,750
How does he still look so young?

1039
01:32:56,750 --> 01:32:59,010
Tobey Maguire, now.

1040
01:32:59,910 --> 01:33:01,290
Oh my god.

1041
01:33:01,810 --> 01:33:08,470
Bro, he looks so, he still has, like, like, that Spider-Man look.

1042
01:33:08,890 --> 01:33:15,130
He's, like, almost 50, but he looks, he looks so young.

1043
01:33:17,190 --> 01:33:18,590
Guys, did you guys hear Kingdom Hearts?

1044
01:33:18,710 --> 01:33:21,370
Kingdom Hearts 4 might be the last Kingdom Hearts in the series.

1045
01:33:21,650 --> 01:33:28,110
The funniest shit I've read about Kingdom Hearts is that, I don't know, I think you guys told me about it.

1046
01:33:28,110 --> 01:33:29,430
I don't know if it's, no.

1047
01:33:29,830 --> 01:33:30,250
Actually, no.

1048
01:33:30,490 --> 01:33:45,110
I don't remember if you guys told me about it, but, like, the funniest shit I heard about Kingdom Hearts is that the creator slash director of Kingdom Hearts has to watch YouTube videos of, like, YouTube Lore Explained videos just to remember what the fuck was going on.

1049
01:33:45,130 --> 01:33:52,710
So he... I'm just like, even you don't remember what's going on?

1050
01:33:53,030 --> 01:33:53,670
What do you mean?

1051
01:33:54,650 --> 01:34:09,650
He, like, he has to... Bro, like, what do you mean you have to watch, like, do you not have your own fucking spark notes of, like, what you were fucking cooking?

1052
01:34:12,690 --> 01:34:13,290
Like...

1053
01:34:15,130 --> 01:34:16,510
It was... Yeah.

1054
01:34:16,950 --> 01:34:26,490
He has to watch, like, YouTube Explained videos of Kingdom Hearts to, like, remember what the fuck he wrote.

1055
01:34:26,690 --> 01:34:30,350
Like, I'm just like... That's just crazy.

1056
01:34:30,630 --> 01:34:31,250
I don't know.

1057
01:34:31,610 --> 01:34:33,130
I don't know about you guys, but...

1058
01:34:34,650 --> 01:34:37,170
He forgot the recipe.

1059
01:34:37,510 --> 01:34:45,270
I'm like, what if, like... I'm just thinking, like, what if there was some plot points that were supposed to be explained later, but he forgot?

1060
01:34:46,050 --> 01:34:49,570
Like, I don't think that YouTube Explained people remember those plot points.

1061
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:51,630
Like, I'm just never told to them.

1062
01:34:52,850 --> 01:34:56,410
He's like, what was the lore again?

1063
01:34:59,310 --> 01:35:02,990
Like, I just... That just blows my mind.

1064
01:35:03,110 --> 01:35:14,070
That just really blows my mind that he has to re-watch, like, he has to watch other content creators' videos to remember what he wrote.

1065
01:35:18,010 --> 01:35:21,790
Surely the YouTubers got most of what I was trying to do.

1066
01:35:23,550 --> 01:35:26,570
What was the lore I made up?

1067
01:35:27,850 --> 01:35:29,870
I... That's what I'm saying!

1068
01:35:30,010 --> 01:35:33,610
Like, I'm just... Don't they have, like, a fucking file?

1069
01:35:33,610 --> 01:35:33,650
No!

1070
01:35:35,610 --> 01:35:40,650
Like, don't they have, like, a file?

1071
01:35:43,350 --> 01:35:46,010
So many years of lore, too.

1072
01:35:49,550 --> 01:35:50,810
Oh my god.

1073
01:35:51,150 --> 01:35:52,550
That, like, blew my mind.

1074
01:35:52,630 --> 01:35:55,330
Anyway, Kingdom Hearts 4 is apparently the last Kingdom Hearts.

1075
01:35:55,850 --> 01:35:59,350
Until, like, I don't know, until they want more money or something.

1076
01:36:00,430 --> 01:36:04,650
Until they're, like, 80 years in the future.

1077
01:36:05,370 --> 01:36:09,170
Sora... Not 80, sorry, 500... I was gonna say Sora is dead after 80 years.

1078
01:36:09,290 --> 01:36:10,350
I'm like, oh, that's...

1079
01:36:12,950 --> 01:36:20,210
500 years in the future, there is now a new Keyblade wielder, and now we gotta do this all over again.

1080
01:36:20,370 --> 01:36:21,630
Kingdom Hearts 5.

1081
01:36:21,630 --> 01:36:22,410
I hate it!

1082
01:36:27,640 --> 01:36:30,980
As long as they... Maybe they'll do it all over again.

1083
01:36:33,460 --> 01:36:34,520
Spoilers, Stokie!

1084
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:36,900
Spoilers, they just signed the contract!

1085
01:36:37,140 --> 01:36:38,720
You're not supposed to say that!

1086
01:36:47,270 --> 01:36:48,830
Disney wants it to end badly?

1087
01:36:49,030 --> 01:36:51,010
I don't think Disney really... I don't think so.

1088
01:36:51,430 --> 01:36:52,190
Money is money.

1089
01:36:54,270 --> 01:36:56,570
I don't think Disney wants it to end badly.

1090
01:36:57,070 --> 01:37:00,030
I think they just, um...

1091
01:37:00,030 --> 01:37:05,550
They just... The only thing Disney doesn't like is that... I think, like, Disney doesn't like violence with their characters.

1092
01:37:06,810 --> 01:37:07,290
They...

1093
01:37:08,310 --> 01:37:10,350
So, I don't know, please use... No!

1094
01:37:11,050 --> 01:37:12,810
Was it actually better if I used a shorter?

1095
01:37:14,070 --> 01:37:14,850
Is it faster?

1096
01:37:15,610 --> 01:37:16,510
I can't tell.

1097
01:37:17,650 --> 01:37:18,750
I actually can't tell.

1098
01:37:20,410 --> 01:37:23,990
I don't know, maybe I've been, like, debuffing myself this entire time.

1099
01:37:26,390 --> 01:37:28,310
Disney is just business, yeah.

1100
01:37:29,530 --> 01:37:32,530
Disney is just... Then why did they kill Goofy in Kingdom Hearts 2?

1101
01:37:32,630 --> 01:37:33,510
Because it's funny.

1102
01:37:33,910 --> 01:37:38,210
Because back then, Disney didn't care as much about death, but now they do.

1103
01:37:39,870 --> 01:37:40,790
No, actually, no.

1104
01:37:41,030 --> 01:37:46,430
No, Ashman, Disney back then, they loved character death, as long as it progressed the plot.

1105
01:37:46,830 --> 01:37:48,210
That's all they liked to do.

1106
01:37:49,850 --> 01:37:56,510
Like, if they can, they will kill off an entire cast, if it meant it will give the main protagonist some sort of character building.

1107
01:38:03,390 --> 01:38:04,390
Disney's just sad?

1108
01:38:04,550 --> 01:38:05,630
Disney's just too big.

1109
01:38:06,830 --> 01:38:17,410
Disney is too big to do something wrong, that they'd rather do... They'd rather make an incredibly mediocre and forgettable movie, than a really, really...

1110
01:38:17,410 --> 01:38:21,370
Than something that is too experimental, that will get them cancelled.

1111
01:38:21,910 --> 01:38:26,730
Because, yeah, they fucked up with Star Wars, but it's not cancellable, it's just a bad movie.

1112
01:38:27,090 --> 01:38:34,110
But they'd rather do that, than, like, experiment with the formula, to risk getting, like, cancelled in something.

1113
01:38:36,970 --> 01:38:38,770
Because they don't like taking risks.

1114
01:38:39,830 --> 01:38:42,790
Because at best, they can just put the movie as a tax write-off.

1115
01:38:44,050 --> 01:38:45,790
Which is basically what they do, anyway.

1116
01:38:45,790 --> 01:38:48,130
Which is what companies do.

1117
01:38:48,430 --> 01:38:51,030
Star Wars is only alive via Nostalgia Bait.

1118
01:38:52,170 --> 01:38:53,270
And Grogu.

1119
01:38:54,990 --> 01:38:56,430
And Baby Yoda.

1120
01:38:57,070 --> 01:38:58,270
That's literally it.

1121
01:39:00,610 --> 01:39:04,830
Nostalgia Bait and Baby Yoda, that's all we have from Star Wars.

1122
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:10,760
Oh, my song stopped playing.

1123
01:39:11,540 --> 01:39:13,640
It paused, because they were like, are you alive?

1124
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:18,260
Yes, YouTube, I am.

1125
01:39:19,940 --> 01:39:22,860
Mandalorian was great, somebody didn't watch season 3.

1126
01:39:27,660 --> 01:39:29,540
That's all I'll say.

1127
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:36,120
No!

1128
01:39:43,700 --> 01:39:47,260
Don't say that, I watched season 2!

1129
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:56,040
Wait, who said season Mandalorian?

1130
01:40:05,340 --> 01:40:07,920
Just stop at season 2, that's all I'll tell you.

1131
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:09,380
Just stop.

1132
01:40:13,780 --> 01:40:16,340
Just stop at season 2.

1133
01:40:21,980 --> 01:40:23,580
That's all you need to know.

1134
01:40:24,540 --> 01:40:26,640
Rest in peace, that one guy.

1135
01:40:34,630 --> 01:40:37,210
It's just... it's just not...

1136
01:40:37,210 --> 01:40:38,430
Okay, like...

1137
01:40:38,430 --> 01:40:40,490
Also, I don't know...

1138
01:40:40,490 --> 01:40:45,070
I don't know, the current trend in movies is that they remove every possible colors.

1139
01:40:45,670 --> 01:40:47,970
In color design.

1140
01:40:49,010 --> 01:40:50,750
I actually miss like...

1141
01:40:50,750 --> 01:40:54,210
Oh, my God, I miss when movies actually had color in it.

1142
01:40:55,750 --> 01:40:59,150
Now everything is like, dark and like...

1143
01:40:59,150 --> 01:41:01,050
Dark and you can't see jack shit.

1144
01:41:04,050 --> 01:41:07,110
Yeah, the color grading is fucking terrible now.

1145
01:41:08,290 --> 01:41:10,610
Yeah, most movies just look so dull.

1146
01:41:10,950 --> 01:41:12,370
It's just not...

1147
01:41:12,370 --> 01:41:13,570
It just doesn't look fun no...

1148
01:41:13,570 --> 01:41:14,230
I don't...

1149
01:41:14,230 --> 01:41:15,970
That's why I don't watch movies anymore.

1150
01:41:16,290 --> 01:41:17,290
I used to watch...

1151
01:41:17,290 --> 01:41:22,090
I just watch animation, because it's the only way I can get some form of color in like...

1152
01:41:22,890 --> 01:41:24,290
Like, some form of like...

1153
01:41:24,990 --> 01:41:26,990
Actual, good color grading.

1154
01:41:27,610 --> 01:41:31,030
And like, set composition and everything.

1155
01:41:31,030 --> 01:41:35,230
So like, I rarely watch like, live action movies these days.

1156
01:41:35,350 --> 01:41:37,450
I mostly just watch animated movies.

1157
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:48,720
Oh, yeah!

1158
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:50,880
I saw the Until Dawn remake.

1159
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:52,560
That's cool.

1160
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:53,460
They...

1161
01:41:53,460 --> 01:41:57,480
Okay, so like, Until Dawn is like, known for like, the...

1162
01:41:57,480 --> 01:41:57,920
The...

1163
01:41:57,920 --> 01:41:59,660
Oh, my God, I'm never gonna make it to this one.

1164
01:41:59,860 --> 01:42:01,980
We're at 37?!

1165
01:42:01,980 --> 01:42:04,000
All I've been doing is cleaning!

1166
01:42:04,900 --> 01:42:06,740
Like, what do you want me...

1167
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:12,420
All I've been doing is cleaning!

1168
01:42:16,700 --> 01:42:18,560
Oh, my God.

1169
01:42:18,940 --> 01:42:19,880
Okay, wide nozzle.

1170
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:21,880
Where the fuck is the wide nozzle?

1171
01:42:22,500 --> 01:42:22,900
I...

1172
01:42:22,900 --> 01:42:23,540
What is...

1173
01:42:23,540 --> 01:42:24,600
Is this wide enough?

1174
01:42:25,100 --> 01:42:25,400
Okay.

1175
01:42:31,940 --> 01:42:32,620
Anyway...

1176
01:42:32,620 --> 01:42:33,820
What was I...

1177
01:42:33,820 --> 01:42:36,720
What was I saying?

1178
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:41,160
Guys, I don't remember what I was saying.

1179
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:44,020
I just can't believe I've only done 37%.

1180
01:42:44,020 --> 01:42:44,820
I...

1181
01:42:44,820 --> 01:42:45,820
I can't believe...

1182
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:46,780
Oh, yeah!

1183
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:48,980
So like, Until Dawn...

1184
01:42:48,980 --> 01:42:50,540
The entire reputation about...

1185
01:42:50,540 --> 01:42:52,080
Like, um...

1186
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:56,800
Reputation with Until Dawn regarding like, it's aesthetic is that it's blue.

1187
01:42:57,860 --> 01:42:59,100
They took away the blue.

1188
01:42:59,480 --> 01:43:01,080
They actually...

1189
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:03,480
They took away the blue!

1190
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:04,800
Like...

1191
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:06,080
I was like...

1192
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:07,400
Did you guys see that?

1193
01:43:08,260 --> 01:43:09,340
Did you guys see...

1194
01:43:09,340 --> 01:43:10,000
Okay, I...

1195
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,400
Okay, let me see if I can find the link.

1196
01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:12,680
I was actually...

1197
01:43:12,680 --> 01:43:14,500
What the fuck did they...

1198
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:16,960
Like...

1199
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:19,080
Like, I can't believe they did...

1200
01:43:19,080 --> 01:43:22,260
I can't believe they took away the blue!

1201
01:43:23,200 --> 01:43:24,060
It's gone!

1202
01:43:24,220 --> 01:43:24,700
Look!

1203
01:43:25,200 --> 01:43:26,940
It's not blue anymore!

1204
01:43:27,860 --> 01:43:28,500
Like, I'm like...

1205
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:29,400
What happened?

1206
01:43:30,060 --> 01:43:32,620
And why is it harder to read?

1207
01:43:39,460 --> 01:43:40,200
Like...

1208
01:43:40,200 --> 01:43:41,340
I was like...

1209
01:43:41,940 --> 01:43:43,040
Oh my God!

1210
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:47,820
She took the blue in the top four!

1211
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:51,360
I'll post the link again.

1212
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:52,780
Like, I'm just like...

1213
01:43:52,780 --> 01:43:54,820
Why is it not blue anymore?

1214
01:43:55,580 --> 01:43:57,120
That's the whole point!

1215
01:43:57,700 --> 01:43:59,360
It's supposed to be blue!

1216
01:44:03,060 --> 01:44:06,120
Like, it's supposed to be blue!

1217
01:44:07,080 --> 01:44:07,980
I don't...

1218
01:44:09,340 --> 01:44:12,300
It's not blue anymore!

1219
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:13,760
Congratulations!

1220
01:44:14,360 --> 01:44:15,780
How is this a remake?

1221
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:17,140
Like...

1222
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:19,440
Like, the fucking...

1223
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:21,040
The dev team was just like...

1224
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:21,640
You know what?

1225
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,980
I hate the color blue!

1226
01:44:24,460 --> 01:44:25,080
Like...

1227
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:27,160
It looks so wack!

1228
01:44:27,640 --> 01:44:28,640
They also made...

1229
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:30,100
What's his name?

1230
01:44:30,340 --> 01:44:31,020
The...

1231
01:44:31,020 --> 01:44:33,640
The Sammy Remake guy...

1232
01:44:33,640 --> 01:44:34,340
Actor...

1233
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,400
Like, super expressive...

1234
01:44:36,940 --> 01:44:38,580
And it's so fucking creepy!

1235
01:44:38,580 --> 01:44:39,960
Like, Josh...

1236
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:40,860
They made Josh...

1237
01:44:41,100 --> 01:44:43,580
Josh so fucking expressive...

1238
01:44:44,100 --> 01:44:45,420
And it's so creepy!

1239
01:44:45,820 --> 01:44:47,280
I don't like it!

1240
01:44:47,380 --> 01:44:49,060
Like, Josh looks like...

1241
01:44:50,100 --> 01:44:50,980
Okay...

1242
01:44:51,580 --> 01:44:52,680
Josh...

1243
01:44:52,680 --> 01:44:53,660
Until...

1244
01:44:53,660 --> 01:44:54,640
Oh yeah, Remi...

1245
01:44:54,640 --> 01:44:55,560
Remi, yeah...

1246
01:44:55,560 --> 01:44:57,340
Remi Malek, yeah...

1247
01:44:57,340 --> 01:44:58,580
Until Dawn...

1248
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:01,880
It just doesn't...

1249
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:04,360
It doesn't feel right!

1250
01:45:04,580 --> 01:45:07,580
It just...

1251
01:45:07,580 --> 01:45:08,720
Oh my God!

1252
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:10,040
He just...

1253
01:45:10,360 --> 01:45:12,100
It just doesn't feel right!

1254
01:45:12,440 --> 01:45:13,360
Oh my God!

1255
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:14,400
I don't know if...

1256
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:14,780
I can't...

1257
01:45:14,780 --> 01:45:16,420
I don't know where...

1258
01:45:16,420 --> 01:45:17,660
There was a video of it...

1259
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:19,580
But I can't...

1260
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:21,640
Remember where it was...

1261
01:45:21,640 --> 01:45:22,780
Somebody will find it...

1262
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:24,480
Mod, do you remember the video?

1263
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:25,800
Because I don't...

1264
01:45:26,380 --> 01:45:27,800
But he was just like...

1265
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:29,580
He just looks super uncanny...

1266
01:45:29,580 --> 01:45:30,580
It just looks like...

1267
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:33,580
It just looks so fucking...

1268
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:36,580
It just looks so weird...

1269
01:45:36,580 --> 01:45:42,140
It doesn't even look like the actor anymore who played him...

1270
01:45:42,140 --> 01:45:44,440
Imagine remaking a game into a worse experience...

1271
01:45:44,440 --> 01:45:45,580
Oh, ducking everyday...

1272
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:50,840
They're literally...

1273
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:53,900
Remaking games that don't even need a remake...

1274
01:45:53,900 --> 01:45:55,580
It's just the cash grab...

1275
01:45:59,940 --> 01:46:01,620
Like all the remasters...

1276
01:46:01,620 --> 01:46:02,120
Yeah...

1277
01:46:02,120 --> 01:46:03,160
I feel like...

1278
01:46:03,160 --> 01:46:04,920
If you're gonna remaster a game...

1279
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:06,580
Give it like 20 years...

1280
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:07,880
Not...

1281
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:08,740
Wait...

1282
01:46:08,740 --> 01:46:09,560
Oh god...

1283
01:46:09,560 --> 01:46:10,620
How many years?

1284
01:46:10,740 --> 01:46:11,940
It must be at least 10...

1285
01:46:11,940 --> 01:46:13,340
Until Dawn is like 10, right?

1286
01:46:14,140 --> 01:46:15,240
It's not even 10 years...

1287
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:15,900
It came out in 2015...

1288
01:46:16,300 --> 01:46:17,080
Oh, it is...

1289
01:46:17,660 --> 01:46:19,020
It's 2024...

1290
01:46:24,160 --> 01:46:25,200
It's 2024...

1291
01:46:29,320 --> 01:46:30,880
I still need it...

1292
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:31,900
Give it 20 years...

1293
01:46:31,900 --> 01:46:33,000
I feel like...

1294
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,780
20 years is like the perfect time for a remaster...

1295
01:46:43,660 --> 01:46:45,420
But I also don't think...

1296
01:46:45,420 --> 01:46:47,220
Until Dawn needs a remake...

1297
01:46:47,220 --> 01:46:48,820
Only because...

1298
01:46:50,180 --> 01:46:51,300
Only because...

1299
01:46:51,300 --> 01:46:52,620
Until Dawn...

1300
01:46:52,620 --> 01:46:53,920
Is still playable...

1301
01:46:53,920 --> 01:46:54,320
Like...

1302
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:55,940
It's still playable...

1303
01:46:55,940 --> 01:46:56,500
And like...

1304
01:46:56,500 --> 01:46:58,780
It doesn't look like it's aged...

1305
01:46:58,780 --> 01:46:59,200
Like...

1306
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:01,860
It looks like Impa still works...

1307
01:47:01,860 --> 01:47:02,400
Too...

1308
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:02,620
Like...

1309
01:47:02,620 --> 01:47:04,000
It doesn't look like it's like...

1310
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,460
Super aged or anything...

1311
01:47:05,460 --> 01:47:07,160
Or like the graphics were bad...

1312
01:47:07,160 --> 01:47:08,480
It just didn't need a remake...

1313
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:08,960
At best...

1314
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:11,380
It just needed to be ported into a newer system...

1315
01:47:11,380 --> 01:47:12,040
Like...

1316
01:47:12,040 --> 01:47:13,560
I can understand porting...

1317
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:14,560
Porting until Dawn...

1318
01:47:15,140 --> 01:47:16,580
Into newer systems...

1319
01:47:16,580 --> 01:47:17,380
But like...

1320
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:20,440
Am I supposed to talk to you?

1321
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:21,000
Like...

1322
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,700
I don't understand...

1323
01:47:23,700 --> 01:47:24,120
Do you...

1324
01:47:24,120 --> 01:47:24,820
Are you lonely?

1325
01:47:26,660 --> 01:47:27,300
Like...

1326
01:47:27,300 --> 01:47:28,380
Sir...

1327
01:47:28,380 --> 01:47:30,800
I'm literally hired help...

1328
01:47:33,900 --> 01:47:34,500
Like...

1329
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:35,380
I don't understand...

1330
01:47:35,380 --> 01:47:36,780
I'm fucking working...

1331
01:47:36,780 --> 01:47:37,200
Like...

1332
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:38,900
If you want me to clean or not...

1333
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:43,560
Did they listed the original?

1334
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:45,120
Are you...

1335
01:47:45,120 --> 01:47:46,900
Oh my god...

1336
01:47:47,640 --> 01:47:48,080
Bro...

1337
01:47:48,080 --> 01:47:53,220
Lord Farquaad is trying to slide into your DMs right now...

1338
01:47:55,460 --> 01:47:56,220
Alright...

1339
01:47:56,220 --> 01:47:57,600
All I'm saying is that...

1340
01:47:57,600 --> 01:47:58,800
He owns a...

1341
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:04,560
Does anyone want to date Lord Farquaad?

1342
01:48:04,620 --> 01:48:06,240
He literally owns...

1343
01:48:06,240 --> 01:48:07,300
Land...

1344
01:48:14,110 --> 01:48:16,490
You can clean whatever...

1345
01:48:16,490 --> 01:48:17,490
I am clean!

1346
01:48:17,590 --> 01:48:17,790
Look!

1347
01:48:17,910 --> 01:48:19,630
I got 41%!

1348
01:48:20,650 --> 01:48:21,730
Oh my god...

1349
01:48:21,730 --> 01:48:24,030
I don't even think I made much progress...

1350
01:48:24,030 --> 01:48:25,330
I don't even...

1351
01:48:25,330 --> 01:48:27,010
Holy shit...

1352
01:48:28,370 --> 01:48:31,330
I barely fucking progressed...

1353
01:48:31,330 --> 01:48:34,250
I wanted to clean Shrek's house!

1354
01:48:36,690 --> 01:48:40,470
I'll never get to clean his fucking swamp!

1355
01:48:41,770 --> 01:48:47,650
I can't believe the first fucking level is a stupid castle!

1356
01:48:51,830 --> 01:48:53,530
Can't believe it...

1357
01:48:55,650 --> 01:48:56,950
Less yapping...

1358
01:48:56,950 --> 01:48:57,470
More cleaning...

1359
01:48:59,870 --> 01:49:00,570
Doki...

1360
01:49:00,570 --> 01:49:01,750
Do it for Shrek...

1361
01:49:01,750 --> 01:49:02,470
Doki...

1362
01:49:02,470 --> 01:49:03,770
Do it for Shrek...

1363
01:49:04,010 --> 01:49:04,950
You know what I miss?

1364
01:49:04,990 --> 01:49:06,750
I miss Shrek Day...

1365
01:49:06,750 --> 01:49:08,810
It was a day for like...

1366
01:49:08,810 --> 01:49:10,810
Where people would just celebrate Shrek...

1367
01:49:11,850 --> 01:49:13,910
And they took it away from us...

1368
01:49:16,030 --> 01:49:18,010
I hope Shrek 5...

1369
01:49:18,010 --> 01:49:20,270
I hope Shrek 5...

1370
01:49:20,270 --> 01:49:21,810
Would be good...

1371
01:49:22,390 --> 01:49:25,810
I think every Shrek movie has actually been really...

1372
01:49:26,730 --> 01:49:29,810
I think it has been decent, every Shrek movie...

1373
01:49:31,350 --> 01:49:35,590
Except for one, the one where Shrek has to find the prince...

1374
01:49:35,590 --> 01:49:37,750
Nevermind, we don't talk about Shrek 3...

1375
01:49:37,750 --> 01:49:40,990
But I think every movie, other than Shrek 3...

1376
01:49:40,990 --> 01:49:41,850
Has been...

1377
01:49:41,850 --> 01:49:43,330
Yeah, I was thinking about Shrek 3...

1378
01:49:43,330 --> 01:49:46,190
I saw that in theaters and I was thinking about it back then...

1379
01:49:46,190 --> 01:49:47,370
And I was like, oh yeah...

1380
01:49:47,370 --> 01:49:49,190
Nevermind, I already forgot...

1381
01:49:49,190 --> 01:49:49,470
How?

1382
01:49:49,630 --> 01:49:51,170
Who said Shrek 4 was bad?

1383
01:49:51,410 --> 01:49:52,170
Who the fuck?

1384
01:49:52,510 --> 01:49:53,710
I cried!

1385
01:49:56,570 --> 01:49:59,570
I cried in Shrek 4!

1386
01:49:59,770 --> 01:50:02,010
I watched it in the theaters!

1387
01:50:02,390 --> 01:50:04,230
And I fucking cried!

1388
01:50:04,650 --> 01:50:06,810
Why did I cry in Shrek 4?

1389
01:50:06,810 --> 01:50:08,810
Because at one point...

1390
01:50:09,430 --> 01:50:10,810
He fucking dies!

1391
01:50:14,470 --> 01:50:16,290
And then I was like...

1392
01:50:16,290 --> 01:50:18,970
I can't believe they killed Shrek!

1393
01:50:19,770 --> 01:50:21,930
And then I cried!

1394
01:50:24,390 --> 01:50:25,670
What do you mean?

1395
01:50:25,750 --> 01:50:29,190
What the fuck do you mean Shrek 4 is bad?

1396
01:50:29,410 --> 01:50:33,570
I've never cried over Shrek before!

1397
01:50:33,570 --> 01:50:40,470
And I can't believe they almost actually tried to kill him!

1398
01:50:46,090 --> 01:50:50,890
I was so surprised because I was like...

1399
01:50:50,890 --> 01:50:53,230
He's in the fucking movie title!

1400
01:50:53,590 --> 01:50:57,830
You don't just kill off the fucking guy in the movie title!

1401
01:50:59,510 --> 01:51:03,250
And then I fucking cried because they actually tried!

1402
01:51:04,030 --> 01:51:05,770
And then he was okay.

1403
01:51:06,330 --> 01:51:07,630
And then he was like...

1404
01:51:07,630 --> 01:51:07,930
J.K.

1405
01:51:10,710 --> 01:51:12,390
It was like...

1406
01:51:12,390 --> 01:51:13,010
J.K.

1407
01:51:13,450 --> 01:51:13,970
And then...

1408
01:51:18,370 --> 01:51:19,870
And then so...

1409
01:51:20,530 --> 01:51:22,270
So I thought it was a...

1410
01:51:22,270 --> 01:51:24,030
I thought it was a pretty good movie.

1411
01:51:24,030 --> 01:51:27,870
I thought it was a really good movie.

1412
01:51:28,750 --> 01:51:30,950
But I hope Shrek 5 is decent.

1413
01:51:31,790 --> 01:51:33,210
The funny thing about it...

1414
01:51:33,210 --> 01:51:34,410
Oh yeah, I was gonna say it.

1415
01:51:34,830 --> 01:51:42,090
Shrek is all about criticizing companies getting greedy with properties and stuff.

1416
01:51:42,770 --> 01:51:49,790
And they're criticizing Disney and the way they do things regarding Disney movies.

1417
01:51:50,350 --> 01:51:51,990
And then it's so funny because...

1418
01:51:51,990 --> 01:51:54,950
Shrek ended up doing the same thing in the end.

1419
01:51:55,810 --> 01:51:56,330
Like...

1420
01:51:58,250 --> 01:52:02,390
And then Shrek got super popular, the brand.

1421
01:52:02,530 --> 01:52:04,790
And then it was like...

1422
01:52:04,790 --> 01:52:07,910
They ended up becoming what they were trying to criticize.

1423
01:52:13,130 --> 01:52:15,970
Yeah, they literally became the villain.

1424
01:52:21,350 --> 01:52:22,630
Bro, it happened so fast.

1425
01:52:22,690 --> 01:52:24,590
It literally happened in one fucking movie.

1426
01:52:25,130 --> 01:52:28,750
Because nobody expected Shrek to be that popular.

1427
01:52:33,540 --> 01:52:36,760
They realized that they too can be capitalist.

1428
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:42,840
Thank you for the super chat.

1429
01:52:42,920 --> 01:52:43,900
Thank you, thank you.

1430
01:52:44,740 --> 01:52:47,880
Last time I cried watching something was when my tax guy was doing taxes.

1431
01:52:48,060 --> 01:52:49,180
Okay, but that's reasonable.

1432
01:52:50,100 --> 01:52:50,820
That's reasonable.

1433
01:52:51,080 --> 01:52:52,700
Is that and also Shrek dying.

1434
01:52:53,140 --> 01:52:54,000
Thank you for the super chat.

1435
01:52:54,060 --> 01:52:54,920
Thank you, thank you.

1436
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:56,260
Turtles, thank you for the super chat.

1437
01:52:56,340 --> 01:52:57,300
Thank you, thank you.

1438
01:52:57,300 --> 01:53:00,500
To be fair, you can probably yeet the little guy out the window and inherit it.

1439
01:53:00,580 --> 01:53:02,000
It's not like police exist in the air.

1440
01:53:02,140 --> 01:53:04,240
I'm literally a cop right now.

1441
01:53:04,720 --> 01:53:05,680
Okay, not a knight.

1442
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:06,300
Not a cop.

1443
01:53:06,440 --> 01:53:06,760
But like...

1444
01:53:07,100 --> 01:53:08,380
That's what knights are for.

1445
01:53:08,720 --> 01:53:09,200
That's...

1446
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:12,900
That's literally what knights are for.

1447
01:53:13,100 --> 01:53:15,040
They're the ye olde medieval cops.

1448
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:20,480
Yeah, basically a cop.

1449
01:53:20,580 --> 01:53:21,980
Ye olde medieval cops.

1450
01:53:23,420 --> 01:53:26,000
What a waste of good dragoon eggs.

1451
01:53:26,860 --> 01:53:29,960
Guys, we might need to replenish our dragoons.

1452
01:53:30,120 --> 01:53:32,240
We've lost many eggs today.

1453
01:53:43,780 --> 01:53:44,820
My eggs.

1454
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:46,580
Rest in peace, newbies.

1455
01:53:51,220 --> 01:53:53,740
I know, what a good waste of food.

1456
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:57,160
How would a dragoon...

1457
01:53:57,160 --> 01:53:59,280
How would the other dragoons eat now?

1458
01:53:59,440 --> 01:54:01,580
I guess you guys could lick the eggs off of this.

1459
01:54:01,580 --> 01:54:03,380
That would be so much easier.

1460
01:54:03,660 --> 01:54:05,360
Wait, is there public lobbies?

1461
01:54:06,900 --> 01:54:07,280
Okay.

1462
01:54:11,990 --> 01:54:12,690
Wait.

1463
01:54:13,330 --> 01:54:14,630
Okay, let me...

1464
01:54:17,490 --> 01:54:18,190
No!

1465
01:54:19,900 --> 01:54:21,930
It has to be friends only.

1466
01:54:22,130 --> 01:54:23,070
That's fucked.

1467
01:54:25,470 --> 01:54:29,190
I wanted to see if I could get like an invite code.

1468
01:54:29,470 --> 01:54:30,550
And then like...

1469
01:54:30,550 --> 01:54:33,050
I wanted to see...

1470
01:54:34,190 --> 01:54:37,610
I wanted to see if there was a way to get an invite code.

1471
01:54:37,850 --> 01:54:39,190
And then just...

1472
01:54:40,610 --> 01:54:44,290
Guys, I just wanted to see if I could outsource my work, okay?

1473
01:54:44,750 --> 01:54:46,790
I just wanted to know.

1474
01:54:48,130 --> 01:54:49,110
Oh, I can...

1475
01:54:49,110 --> 01:54:50,630
Wait, I can skip this?

1476
01:54:51,670 --> 01:54:52,670
Oh my god.

1477
01:54:53,550 --> 01:54:54,470
Oh my god.

1478
01:54:55,370 --> 01:54:56,350
This is all I wanted.

1479
01:54:58,170 --> 01:54:58,870
Oh my god.

1480
01:54:58,910 --> 01:54:59,890
Wait, this is the honeymoon.

1481
01:55:01,530 --> 01:55:02,770
This is the honeymoon.

1482
01:55:02,770 --> 01:55:04,090
I left.

1483
01:55:04,350 --> 01:55:05,770
I already left the job.

1484
01:55:06,110 --> 01:55:09,070
What are you doing in my...

1485
01:55:09,070 --> 01:55:10,790
That's not your swamp, Shrek.

1486
01:55:12,150 --> 01:55:14,290
This is where he's gonna get busy.

1487
01:55:15,730 --> 01:55:17,190
We could have...

1488
01:55:17,770 --> 01:55:21,110
We could have skipped this all along.

1489
01:55:21,570 --> 01:55:24,110
We're at Hanzo's honeymoon hideaway.

1490
01:55:26,610 --> 01:55:28,410
Wait, what is the green?

1491
01:55:28,610 --> 01:55:31,210
Oh no, did he ogre all over it?

1492
01:55:31,210 --> 01:55:32,270
Like...

1493
01:55:33,110 --> 01:55:34,010
This is...

1494
01:55:34,010 --> 01:55:36,770
Oh no, why is it green?

1495
01:55:40,930 --> 01:55:42,190
Oh no.

1496
01:55:43,050 --> 01:55:44,590
How do I open the door?

1497
01:55:46,470 --> 01:55:50,210
Guys, I don't feel comfortable with the fact that...

1498
01:55:51,110 --> 01:55:52,370
It's green.

1499
01:55:53,350 --> 01:55:54,350
I don't feel...

1500
01:55:55,470 --> 01:55:58,170
Guys, it's the honeymoon suite, guys.

1501
01:55:58,630 --> 01:56:00,810
It's the honeymoon suite, though.

1502
01:56:00,810 --> 01:56:01,530
It's the...

1503
01:56:03,570 --> 01:56:06,070
Don't open the door, Doki.

1504
01:56:06,570 --> 01:56:08,290
Don't do it!

1505
01:56:09,970 --> 01:56:12,050
How do I open the door anyway?

1506
01:56:13,370 --> 01:56:14,670
Do I have to clean the inside?

1507
01:56:19,350 --> 01:56:20,550
I don't think so.

1508
01:56:20,630 --> 01:56:21,330
Oh, thank God.

1509
01:56:21,710 --> 01:56:22,470
I gotta make sure.

1510
01:56:24,130 --> 01:56:28,010
Chimney, front door, front door, front wall, front window.

1511
01:56:28,590 --> 01:56:29,190
Signpost.

1512
01:56:29,910 --> 01:56:30,730
Onion carriage.

1513
01:56:30,890 --> 01:56:31,570
Okay, it's...

1514
01:56:31,570 --> 01:56:31,990
I don't.

1515
01:56:31,990 --> 01:56:32,870
Oh, thank God.

1516
01:56:34,090 --> 01:56:34,650
Okay.

1517
01:56:35,070 --> 01:56:36,110
Wait, is there...

1518
01:56:37,950 --> 01:56:40,110
Is there a way to access the other one?

1519
01:56:40,210 --> 01:56:41,950
Okay, we're just gonna clean this first.

1520
01:56:44,830 --> 01:56:45,950
Alright, well...

1521
01:56:45,950 --> 01:56:47,790
We don't ask questions, guys.

1522
01:56:47,850 --> 01:56:49,170
We all signed a contract.

1523
01:56:49,450 --> 01:56:52,230
We can't ask any questions as to why...

1524
01:56:52,230 --> 01:56:53,870
As to why the...

1525
01:56:53,870 --> 01:56:55,190
Why is there green?

1526
01:56:55,390 --> 01:56:57,850
No filter is wild!

1527
01:56:58,310 --> 01:57:00,490
Alright, you explain why it's green!

1528
01:57:04,270 --> 01:57:05,110
Thank you.

1529
01:57:05,230 --> 01:57:07,450
Why else would it be green?

1530
01:57:08,630 --> 01:57:10,390
Thank you for the super chat.

1531
01:57:10,530 --> 01:57:10,930
Thank you.

1532
01:57:11,010 --> 01:57:11,910
Thank you.

1533
01:57:14,090 --> 01:57:16,150
Neko, thank you for your very first super chat.

1534
01:57:16,230 --> 01:57:16,510
Thank you.

1535
01:57:16,570 --> 01:57:17,350
Thank you.

1536
01:57:18,050 --> 01:57:20,150
Did you know that the Shrek film is in the U.S.

1537
01:57:20,270 --> 01:57:21,190
Library of Congress?

1538
01:57:21,410 --> 01:57:22,450
It is a...

1539
01:57:22,450 --> 01:57:24,010
It is a part of history.

1540
01:57:24,170 --> 01:57:25,170
I'm not surprised.

1541
01:57:29,850 --> 01:57:30,270
Generations...

1542
01:57:30,910 --> 01:57:33,410
How Shrek is love and Shrek is life.

1543
01:57:33,710 --> 01:57:35,570
You know what should be in the Congress?

1544
01:57:36,090 --> 01:57:36,490
That...

1545
01:57:36,490 --> 01:57:37,210
That video.

1546
01:57:37,310 --> 01:57:39,150
That video changes people.

1547
01:57:41,470 --> 01:57:42,250
Thank you for the super chat.

1548
01:57:42,350 --> 01:57:43,270
Thank you, thank you.

1549
01:57:44,430 --> 01:57:45,630
Loli, thank you for the super chat.

1550
01:57:45,710 --> 01:57:46,670
Thank you, thank you.

1551
01:57:47,210 --> 01:57:50,190
Did you read the original Shrek book where he has heat vision?

1552
01:57:50,330 --> 01:57:51,010
Thank you for the super chat.

1553
01:57:51,070 --> 01:57:51,730
Thank you, thank you.

1554
01:57:51,830 --> 01:57:56,230
I'm pretty sure the original book has nothing to do with any of the movies.

1555
01:57:57,630 --> 01:57:58,030
I...

1556
01:57:58,030 --> 01:57:59,210
Why is there mold?

1557
01:58:01,970 --> 01:58:04,310
Why is there mold on this house?

1558
01:58:04,410 --> 01:58:05,410
Like, this is...

1559
01:58:05,410 --> 01:58:07,150
Is that black mold?

1560
01:58:07,690 --> 01:58:09,250
Like, is that...

1561
01:58:10,970 --> 01:58:11,650
Guys.

1562
01:58:11,930 --> 01:58:12,330
Guys.

1563
01:58:12,690 --> 01:58:14,310
Guys, I think we need to call somebody.

1564
01:58:14,430 --> 01:58:15,290
That's black mold.

1565
01:58:15,470 --> 01:58:16,450
There's no...

1566
01:58:16,450 --> 01:58:18,590
It's a cat house.

1567
01:58:19,470 --> 01:58:22,150
It's made of...

1568
01:58:26,470 --> 01:58:28,390
I feel like...

1569
01:58:28,390 --> 01:58:30,250
I feel like...

1570
01:58:30,270 --> 01:58:31,270
I feel like...

1571
01:58:31,810 --> 01:58:33,270
I feel like this house...

1572
01:58:34,690 --> 01:58:36,730
Might not be safe to live in.

1573
01:58:37,510 --> 01:58:39,590
It's a gingerbread house.

1574
01:58:40,290 --> 01:58:41,730
Don't ask questions, Doki.

1575
01:58:41,810 --> 01:58:43,030
You signed a contract.

1576
01:58:45,510 --> 01:58:48,010
Doki, you're not supposed to ask questions.

1577
01:58:53,960 --> 01:58:55,160
Fun, thank you for the super chat.

1578
01:58:55,240 --> 01:58:56,060
Thank you, thank you.

1579
01:58:56,160 --> 01:58:57,900
No wonder Fiona chose to be with Shrek.

1580
01:58:58,260 --> 01:59:00,080
If that's what the house looks like, she probably...

1581
01:59:00,900 --> 01:59:02,400
I didn't...

1582
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:04,020
Thank you for the super chat.

1583
01:59:04,300 --> 01:59:05,820
Thank you, thank you.

1584
01:59:07,160 --> 01:59:08,080
No.

1585
01:59:08,580 --> 01:59:09,320
No.

1586
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:14,300
I miss...

1587
01:59:14,300 --> 01:59:17,540
I miss eating gingerbread.

1588
01:59:18,780 --> 01:59:20,620
I haven't had gingerbread in a long time.

1589
01:59:21,700 --> 01:59:22,120
Yay.

1590
01:59:27,310 --> 01:59:28,230
Yay.

1591
01:59:29,750 --> 01:59:31,950
I just want to clean the swamp.

1592
01:59:32,490 --> 01:59:37,330
How many percentages do I have to unlock to get the swamp?

1593
01:59:38,010 --> 01:59:40,010
I just want to clean the swamp.

1594
01:59:40,350 --> 01:59:42,250
I just want to get to the house.

1595
01:59:42,490 --> 01:59:45,150
Okay, maybe if I just do this.

1596
01:59:46,470 --> 01:59:47,050
Maybe if I...

1597
01:59:47,050 --> 01:59:48,450
Maybe if I get to 30%.

1598
01:59:49,100 --> 01:59:51,070
I'll just like clean really fast.

1599
01:59:51,530 --> 01:59:53,450
And then maybe I'll get to 30%.

1600
01:59:53,450 --> 01:59:54,690
And then I'm gonna...

1601
01:59:54,690 --> 01:59:55,440
I'll be able to...

1602
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:57,300
I don't know why you're bothering.

1603
01:59:57,660 --> 01:59:59,440
This place looks fine to me.

1604
01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:00,300
Oh, Shrek.

1605
02:00:00,840 --> 02:00:02,540
You fucking freak.

1606
02:00:03,080 --> 02:00:03,340
Shrek.

1607
02:00:03,960 --> 02:00:07,020
You are such a goddamn freak, my dude.

1608
02:00:07,420 --> 02:00:08,820
You're such a...

1609
02:00:12,180 --> 02:00:14,560
Although there might be an odd...

1610
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:15,880
Is that what you call it?

1611
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:17,800
Is that what you and Fiona call it?

1612
02:00:18,320 --> 02:00:19,180
I'm snotting.

1613
02:00:19,280 --> 02:00:19,640
I'm...

1614
02:00:27,260 --> 02:00:28,440
Toki, no!

1615
02:00:30,680 --> 02:00:31,960
No, Toki!

1616
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:34,280
It's all over.

1617
02:00:34,740 --> 02:00:37,580
He's gonna ogre all over the place.

1618
02:00:38,920 --> 02:00:39,900
Toki, why?

1619
02:00:46,990 --> 02:00:47,830
Look, look.

1620
02:00:47,890 --> 02:00:49,730
If that's what they're into, guys.

1621
02:00:50,030 --> 02:00:54,270
If that's what Fiona and Shrek calls it these days.

1622
02:00:54,450 --> 02:00:55,830
Then why...

1623
02:00:55,830 --> 02:00:57,430
Who are we to judge?

1624
02:00:57,430 --> 02:01:02,530
Who are we to judge them and their love life?

1625
02:01:02,970 --> 02:01:03,530
Aphelion!

1626
02:01:04,450 --> 02:01:06,150
Thank you for the 10 gifted ships!

1627
02:01:06,370 --> 02:01:07,270
Thank you, thank you!

1628
02:01:07,350 --> 02:01:09,610
Oh my god, he ogred all over here too.

1629
02:01:11,330 --> 02:01:13,750
Guys, that's why they had three kids.

1630
02:01:20,330 --> 02:01:21,690
That's all I'll say.

1631
02:01:26,250 --> 02:01:26,850
See?

1632
02:01:33,550 --> 02:01:34,850
Weren't they triplets?

1633
02:01:35,150 --> 02:01:37,470
Oh, that's what they want you to believe.

1634
02:01:46,540 --> 02:01:47,740
Honestly, like...

1635
02:01:47,740 --> 02:01:50,680
It's triplets, but it's not how we think happened.

1636
02:01:56,670 --> 02:01:56,970
Alright.

1637
02:01:57,430 --> 02:01:59,110
This is like almost clean enough.

1638
02:01:59,110 --> 02:02:00,730
Literally, it's just a roof.

1639
02:02:02,270 --> 02:02:03,510
Loli, thank you for the super chat.

1640
02:02:03,590 --> 02:02:04,750
Can I do his house now?

1641
02:02:05,850 --> 02:02:07,070
Can I do his house?

1642
02:02:07,390 --> 02:02:08,350
Can I afford it?

1643
02:02:10,510 --> 02:02:12,270
Can I afford his house now?

1644
02:02:13,310 --> 02:02:15,070
No, I don't wanna do Duloc again.

1645
02:02:17,790 --> 02:02:18,810
What the fuck?

1646
02:02:19,130 --> 02:02:20,670
How do I unlock the new?

1647
02:02:21,210 --> 02:02:22,270
How do I unlock...

1648
02:02:22,270 --> 02:02:24,330
Oh, maybe if I hit 46%.

1649
02:02:24,330 --> 02:02:25,730
Is it 46%?

1650
02:02:25,870 --> 02:02:26,810
Then I unlock it?

1651
02:02:30,210 --> 02:02:31,170
Oh, Ozni.

1652
02:02:31,330 --> 02:02:31,730
No.

1653
02:02:32,110 --> 02:02:35,150
I still can't believe she blew up that much.

1654
02:02:35,210 --> 02:02:36,390
It's not funny.

1655
02:02:37,490 --> 02:02:38,670
How is that a meme?

1656
02:02:38,790 --> 02:02:39,250
Like, good...

1657
02:02:39,250 --> 02:02:40,210
Okay, honestly, though.

1658
02:02:40,310 --> 02:02:44,140
Good on her for like capitalizing on the...

1659
02:02:44,950 --> 02:02:46,090
Capitalizing on everything.

1660
02:02:47,690 --> 02:02:50,290
But like, I just don't find it funny.

1661
02:02:50,430 --> 02:02:51,510
Like, I...

1662
02:02:53,890 --> 02:02:55,790
I respect the grind.

1663
02:02:55,970 --> 02:02:58,150
I do respect the grind, though.

1664
02:02:58,150 --> 02:03:01,570
Like, good on her for the fucking grind.

1665
02:03:01,830 --> 02:03:03,510
I just personally don't find it funny.

1666
02:03:04,290 --> 02:03:04,530
At all.

1667
02:03:04,830 --> 02:03:05,390
I don't have...

1668
02:03:05,390 --> 02:03:06,290
I have no idea.

1669
02:03:06,470 --> 02:03:07,470
Cause like, you know.

1670
02:03:08,210 --> 02:03:08,790
It's like...

1671
02:03:08,790 --> 02:03:10,450
I guess it's like normie humor.

1672
02:03:10,930 --> 02:03:12,110
Like, I'm pretty normie.

1673
02:03:12,230 --> 02:03:14,510
But like, that is way too normie for me.

1674
02:03:16,390 --> 02:03:17,630
Thank you for the superchat.

1675
02:03:17,690 --> 02:03:18,390
Thank you, thank you.

1676
02:03:18,670 --> 02:03:20,830
Since it's a swamp, it will be needed after you clean it.

1677
02:03:20,870 --> 02:03:22,450
You get reverse a mechanic.

1678
02:03:22,550 --> 02:03:25,790
And you just get some sort of filth gun to re-swampify the place.

1679
02:03:26,050 --> 02:03:26,950
Thank you for the superchat.

1680
02:03:27,010 --> 02:03:27,610
Thank you, thank you.

1681
02:03:27,610 --> 02:03:28,610
That's a nice concept.

1682
02:03:28,690 --> 02:03:29,390
I actually like that.

1683
02:03:29,590 --> 02:03:31,710
Maybe if I clean it at 40%.

1684
02:03:31,710 --> 02:03:32,750
Then I would...

1685
02:03:33,710 --> 02:03:35,290
Then I'll unlock the swamp.

1686
02:03:35,830 --> 02:03:37,010
Medi, thank you for the superchat.

1687
02:03:37,090 --> 02:03:38,070
Thank you, thank you.

1688
02:03:38,390 --> 02:03:41,730
He's got his ogre all over the place.

1689
02:03:41,870 --> 02:03:42,810
Thank you for the superchat.

1690
02:03:43,290 --> 02:03:44,430
Thank you, thank you.

1691
02:03:46,170 --> 02:03:48,610
Do you feel like you became less normie over the years?

1692
02:03:50,230 --> 02:03:50,670
Um...

1693
02:03:50,670 --> 02:03:51,510
Not really.

1694
02:03:52,830 --> 02:03:54,610
Not really, because like...

1695
02:03:56,310 --> 02:03:56,750
Um...

1696
02:03:57,530 --> 02:03:58,030
Um...

1697
02:03:58,030 --> 02:03:58,900
I feel like...

1698
02:04:00,450 --> 02:04:00,950
Uh...

1699
02:04:01,750 --> 02:04:02,250
I...

1700
02:04:02,250 --> 02:04:02,810
I like...

1701
02:04:02,810 --> 02:04:05,530
I'm like at the gamer category of normie.

1702
02:04:05,770 --> 02:04:07,920
So like, I'm not like frat boy normie.

1703
02:04:08,410 --> 02:04:09,910
I'm like gamer...

1704
02:04:09,910 --> 02:04:11,050
Gamer normie.

1705
02:04:11,390 --> 02:04:12,170
So you know like...

1706
02:04:12,170 --> 02:04:12,430
You know...

1707
02:04:12,430 --> 02:04:14,370
You know what I mean by gamer normies?

1708
02:04:15,350 --> 02:04:15,850
Like...

1709
02:04:15,850 --> 02:04:16,350
Obviously...

1710
02:04:16,350 --> 02:04:17,410
Like, you know, like...

1711
02:04:17,410 --> 02:04:18,890
Gamer normies were like...

1712
02:04:18,890 --> 02:04:20,730
All they do is play like Call of Duty.

1713
02:04:21,130 --> 02:04:21,470
And...

1714
02:04:22,930 --> 02:04:25,690
Yeah, the gamer pro normie.

1715
02:04:27,030 --> 02:04:30,690
I suppose there might be a slight stain by the...

1716
02:04:30,690 --> 02:04:32,330
What did you do?

1717
02:04:34,770 --> 02:04:35,410
Shrek...

1718
02:04:35,410 --> 02:04:38,470
What the fuck were you and Veniona into?

1719
02:04:40,990 --> 02:04:41,630
Like...

1720
02:04:41,630 --> 02:04:42,590
I was boiling...

1721
02:04:42,590 --> 02:04:43,810
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1722
02:04:44,170 --> 02:04:48,090
Yeah, you were boiling up some slime-covered toadstool...

1723
02:04:48,090 --> 02:04:51,730
For a late night hot toadie.

1724
02:04:51,970 --> 02:04:53,750
And it exploded...

1725
02:04:54,450 --> 02:04:55,790
Oh, is that what they call it?

1726
02:04:56,580 --> 02:05:00,770
Like, it really caked itself on the wall.

1727
02:05:01,050 --> 02:05:03,710
Oh, yeah, it exploded all right.

1728
02:05:07,250 --> 02:05:08,890
Toki, please.

1729
02:05:13,580 --> 02:05:13,990
Yeah.

1730
02:05:15,030 --> 02:05:17,790
And by slime-covered toadstool...

1731
02:05:18,330 --> 02:05:19,490
That's what he calls...

1732
02:05:19,490 --> 02:05:21,170
That's what he calls me.

1733
02:05:26,650 --> 02:05:28,190
Shrek, this is a little TMI.

1734
02:05:28,350 --> 02:05:29,670
I'm just a hired help.

1735
02:05:33,430 --> 02:05:34,910
Shrek is love.

1736
02:05:35,170 --> 02:05:36,290
Shrek is life.

1737
02:05:37,710 --> 02:05:41,970
Guys, if I have to get fucking TMI texts from Shrek...

1738
02:05:41,970 --> 02:05:43,350
Then you do too.

1739
02:05:43,870 --> 02:05:46,970
Then you have to live through this too with me.

1740
02:05:48,270 --> 02:05:49,110
Do I...

1741
02:05:49,110 --> 02:05:50,630
How do I unlock it?

1742
02:05:50,890 --> 02:05:52,130
Is it 46%?

1743
02:05:53,930 --> 02:05:55,430
I just don't understand.

1744
02:05:55,870 --> 02:05:58,030
I don't understand how I unlock the honeymoon stage.

1745
02:06:01,720 --> 02:06:04,520
Like, I feel like I've already cleaned up so much.

1746
02:06:08,430 --> 02:06:12,050
These techniques from the Shrekku Sutra sure are something.

1747
02:06:12,290 --> 02:06:14,690
Cats, thank you for the super chat.

1748
02:06:14,870 --> 02:06:16,230
Thank you, thank you.

1749
02:06:16,650 --> 02:06:18,150
Isn't this Gingerbread Man?

1750
02:06:18,250 --> 02:06:19,370
No, it's Hansel's hat.

1751
02:06:19,850 --> 02:06:20,810
Hansel took over.

1752
02:06:22,210 --> 02:06:24,190
This is now Hansel's domain now.

1753
02:06:26,950 --> 02:06:29,510
Oh, I just wanted to clean the swamp.

1754
02:06:29,850 --> 02:06:32,050
Now I'm cleaning his fucking love shack.

1755
02:06:34,950 --> 02:06:37,470
Why is it turning into Doki Reads fanfic?

1756
02:06:37,570 --> 02:06:41,410
It's not fanfic if Shrek is like fucking texting me this.

1757
02:06:42,170 --> 02:06:44,190
I'm literally just trying to clean.

1758
02:06:46,870 --> 02:06:49,590
I'm actually trying to do my job.

1759
02:06:52,730 --> 02:06:53,390
Okay.

1760
02:06:54,350 --> 02:06:56,870
He's the one that's making it inappropriate.

1761
02:06:58,070 --> 02:07:00,290
The love shack.

1762
02:07:03,120 --> 02:07:05,600
Please give me your swamp to clean.

1763
02:07:06,880 --> 02:07:06,980
Please.

1764
02:07:07,940 --> 02:07:11,800
To unlock you usually need to get married first.

1765
02:07:13,060 --> 02:07:16,340
I just want to unlock his fucking swamp.

1766
02:07:17,120 --> 02:07:19,040
That's my endgame.

1767
02:07:19,180 --> 02:07:20,500
That's all I want.

1768
02:07:22,020 --> 02:07:24,940
Guys, how do I unlock it?

1769
02:07:28,620 --> 02:07:31,860
How the fuck do I unlock the fucking swamp?

1770
02:07:34,880 --> 02:07:39,360
Is this how Shrek feels when Donkey starts yapping without shutting up?

1771
02:07:40,700 --> 02:07:42,400
I mean the dragon likes it.

1772
02:07:42,560 --> 02:07:44,680
Okay, but you know like what they say about people.

1773
02:07:50,920 --> 02:07:52,160
Okay, I'll stop.

1774
02:07:53,120 --> 02:07:54,340
Donkey, stop.

1775
02:07:55,320 --> 02:07:58,840
Do I have the swamp unlocked yet?

1776
02:08:00,180 --> 02:08:01,400
What do they say?

1777
02:08:01,840 --> 02:08:02,360
I don't know.

1778
02:08:02,440 --> 02:08:03,440
What do they say, chat?

1779
02:08:04,300 --> 02:08:06,580
You guys told me to stop, so I guess I'll stop.

1780
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:09,360
Guess you'll never know.

1781
02:08:10,500 --> 02:08:12,200
I guess we'll never know.

1782
02:08:12,680 --> 02:08:15,260
Just remember you guys wanted me to stop.

1783
02:08:15,480 --> 02:08:17,200
You guys say what?

1784
02:08:18,240 --> 02:08:19,100
I don't know.

1785
02:08:19,100 --> 02:08:23,940
You guys finally bought my silence, so I guess you'll never know, chat.

1786
02:08:25,340 --> 02:08:27,240
I guess we'll never know.

1787
02:08:28,700 --> 02:08:30,660
I didn't say stop.

1788
02:08:31,380 --> 02:08:33,360
Well, we know who's the freak here, too.

1789
02:08:33,780 --> 02:08:39,980
We know who's also a fucking freak, I guess.

1790
02:08:41,140 --> 02:08:43,540
Producer didn't want me to stop.

1791
02:08:51,300 --> 02:08:52,660
Oh my god.

1792
02:08:52,660 --> 02:08:56,720
Am I close to getting- Guys, this is all I wanted.

1793
02:08:57,120 --> 02:09:03,980
All I wanted was- I just wanted- Guys, does any- I just wanted- Oh, wait.

1794
02:09:04,160 --> 02:09:05,680
I can buy stuff?

1795
02:09:06,540 --> 02:09:10,380
I can- Oh, shit.

1796
02:09:10,780 --> 02:09:11,580
Wait, what?

1797
02:09:12,040 --> 02:09:12,900
Oh, it's $900.

1798
02:09:13,480 --> 02:09:15,760
Okay, I can't afford it anyway.

1799
02:09:16,040 --> 02:09:17,880
I can't afford it anyway.

1800
02:09:17,880 --> 02:09:20,100
I was gonna be like, are you serious?

1801
02:09:20,100 --> 02:09:23,940
I could've bought something this entire time, but I couldn't afford it.

1802
02:09:24,040 --> 02:09:24,900
Thank fuck you, God.

1803
02:09:24,980 --> 02:09:27,700
I was gonna be like- No, my God, I almost did Duloc again.

1804
02:09:27,840 --> 02:09:29,480
Please don't make me do Duloc again.

1805
02:09:31,980 --> 02:09:33,340
I'm buying your silence.

1806
02:09:33,480 --> 02:09:34,540
Go ham, queen.

1807
02:09:36,560 --> 02:09:38,620
Thank you for the super chat.

1808
02:09:38,960 --> 02:09:40,200
Thank you, thank you.

1809
02:09:40,740 --> 02:09:43,980
Oh my God, now we know who's the super freak, too.

1810
02:09:45,940 --> 02:09:48,180
Pretty sure we told you to keep going.

1811
02:09:48,340 --> 02:09:49,900
Gladstone, thank you for the super chat.

1812
02:09:49,900 --> 02:09:51,080
Thank you, thank you.

1813
02:09:52,280 --> 02:09:52,760
Alright.

1814
02:09:53,260 --> 02:09:57,540
Doki is making too many good guesses to be considered innocent, but I can't stop listening.

1815
02:09:58,100 --> 02:09:59,140
Thank you for the super chat.

1816
02:09:59,240 --> 02:10:01,080
Wings, thank you, thank you.

1817
02:10:01,380 --> 02:10:03,640
Cas, thank you for the magenta super.

1818
02:10:03,840 --> 02:10:05,020
Thank you, thank you.

1819
02:10:05,640 --> 02:10:07,160
Second and go wild.

1820
02:10:07,540 --> 02:10:09,060
JL, thank you for the super chat.

1821
02:10:09,140 --> 02:10:10,000
Thank you, thank you.

1822
02:10:10,280 --> 02:10:14,160
Any dragoon who doesn't love- Oh, what does it start saying?

1823
02:10:15,180 --> 02:10:19,180
Then there's all that sludge down the side of the house?

1824
02:10:20,380 --> 02:10:21,600
Shrek, what?

1825
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:24,160
You took it outside?

1826
02:10:25,160 --> 02:10:32,400
We were having a romantic mud bath, and I caught a few fairies in bottles for soft lighting.

1827
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:35,620
Okay, what happened?

1828
02:10:36,380 --> 02:10:37,600
You made them watch?

1829
02:10:38,620 --> 02:10:44,000
Then to create a full spa experience, I left off a real- You made them watch?

1830
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:44,860
You-

1831
02:10:48,200 --> 02:10:51,780
Bro, did the fairies consent to that?

1832
02:10:52,900 --> 02:10:54,480
Bro, Shrek.

1833
02:10:55,340 --> 02:11:00,620
Guess the smell was too much for the fairies as they all broke free and chased us out the window.

1834
02:11:02,900 --> 02:11:04,180
Holy fuck.

1835
02:11:05,440 --> 02:11:07,940
Bro, that's fucking freaky, bro.

1836
02:11:08,380 --> 02:11:12,000
That's actually- That's actually mega freaky.

1837
02:11:16,940 --> 02:11:19,760
Zekra, thank you for the Akasupa, thank you, thank you.

1838
02:11:19,780 --> 02:11:22,480
I'm praying you to stop.

1839
02:11:23,540 --> 02:11:24,340
Sorry, guys.

1840
02:11:24,780 --> 02:11:26,360
My sons got re-bought, guys.

1841
02:11:26,920 --> 02:11:29,020
JL, thank you again for the super chat.

1842
02:11:29,100 --> 02:11:30,020
Thank you, thank you.

1843
02:11:30,140 --> 02:11:31,780
Sorry, guys, it got re-bought.

1844
02:11:33,560 --> 02:11:34,020
Coward.

1845
02:11:34,300 --> 02:11:35,860
How dare you?

1846
02:11:39,740 --> 02:11:42,000
I'm countering Zekra's Akasupa.

1847
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,420
Akasupa, yap away.

1848
02:11:44,840 --> 02:11:46,080
Thank you for the Akasupa.

1849
02:11:46,220 --> 02:11:47,940
Thank you, thank you, JL.

1850
02:11:48,320 --> 02:11:54,380
Okay, all I'm saying was that- Alright, so you know how, like- I'm praying you to double down.

1851
02:11:55,540 --> 02:11:57,700
Thank you for the Akasupa, Anton.

1852
02:11:57,900 --> 02:11:59,120
Thank you, thank you.

1853
02:11:59,540 --> 02:12:08,120
Anyway, so I was saying- I don't like how, like- After you clean the black mold off the gingerbread, it's like white underneath.

1854
02:12:10,020 --> 02:12:11,840
How do you make such a mess?

1855
02:12:12,700 --> 02:12:13,600
Ah, good question.

1856
02:12:14,540 --> 02:12:16,200
Thank you for the super chat.

1857
02:12:16,320 --> 02:12:17,200
Thank you, thank you.

1858
02:12:17,660 --> 02:12:30,700
But like- But like, okay, so like- You know how, like- You know how, like, you know- The dragon and the donkey got together and made three children as well?

1859
02:12:31,080 --> 02:12:38,100
So like, I'm just thinking, like- Obviously- Obviously, donkey is a big talk.

1860
02:12:38,100 --> 02:12:38,920
Talker, right?

1861
02:12:39,580 --> 02:12:40,280
So like-

1862
02:12:45,960 --> 02:12:50,380
So like, you know- He knows how to-

1863
02:12:55,180 --> 02:12:56,180
Yeah, stop.

1864
02:12:58,960 --> 02:13:01,100
He knows how to what, donkey?

1865
02:13:01,380 --> 02:13:02,900
I guess he'll never know.

1866
02:13:03,420 --> 02:13:03,840
I guess.

1867
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:05,640
Please.

1868
02:13:08,960 --> 02:13:09,600
Please.

1869
02:13:13,400 --> 02:13:13,780
Alright.

1870
02:13:14,200 --> 02:13:15,700
Oh my god, is this it?

1871
02:13:15,960 --> 02:13:18,000
Is this good enough to unlock the swamp?

1872
02:13:19,080 --> 02:13:21,360
How is this not good enough for the swamp?

1873
02:13:21,920 --> 02:13:23,400
I don't understand!

1874
02:13:23,880 --> 02:13:27,520
I've cleaned 67% of the fucking area!

1875
02:13:27,520 --> 02:13:27,900
Yeah!

1876
02:13:31,340 --> 02:13:33,600
He just has bard level of riz.

1877
02:13:33,900 --> 02:13:35,660
I mean, he could be good at other things.

1878
02:13:43,980 --> 02:13:47,520
Now, no need to brag.

1879
02:13:47,640 --> 02:13:51,540
We all know- Thank you for the super chat.

1880
02:13:51,620 --> 02:13:52,660
Thank you, thank you.

1881
02:13:54,220 --> 02:13:55,700
I just want the swamp.

1882
02:13:55,700 --> 02:13:56,800
That's all I want.

1883
02:13:57,500 --> 02:13:58,940
That's all I want, Shrek.

1884
02:13:59,220 --> 02:14:01,680
How much more do you want me to clean?

1885
02:14:02,360 --> 02:14:05,580
I just- Just give me the fucking swamp!

1886
02:14:06,820 --> 02:14:08,600
That's my end goal!

1887
02:14:09,300 --> 02:14:11,340
That's all I want in life!

1888
02:14:18,650 --> 02:14:19,250
Okay.

1889
02:14:20,150 --> 02:14:22,270
He doesn't even care that it's dirty!

1890
02:14:22,390 --> 02:14:24,070
That's his entire thing!

1891
02:14:27,710 --> 02:14:29,650
Okay, this is not my fault.

1892
02:14:29,850 --> 02:14:30,590
Pickle cucumber.

1893
02:14:31,090 --> 02:14:33,190
I'm literally in the honeymoon suite.

1894
02:14:33,510 --> 02:14:39,250
Like, this is not my- Like, they're literally handing me this on a platter.

1895
02:14:39,650 --> 02:14:41,750
Like, literally honeymoon time.

1896
02:14:41,830 --> 02:14:42,910
Just married.

1897
02:14:43,290 --> 02:14:45,410
What the fuck was I supposed to do?

1898
02:14:45,710 --> 02:14:49,170
Like, they handed it to me on a fucking silver platter.

1899
02:14:49,490 --> 02:14:50,610
What am I supposed to do?

1900
02:14:50,650 --> 02:14:52,750
I'm not supposed to take it and run with it?

1901
02:14:52,930 --> 02:14:54,050
Like- I'm not supposed to take it and run with it?

1902
02:14:56,030 --> 02:14:57,050
Oh my god.

1903
02:14:57,390 --> 02:14:58,070
Did I unlock it?

1904
02:14:58,270 --> 02:14:58,690
No!

1905
02:15:02,710 --> 02:15:08,270
I just- I just want- I just want to clean the swamp!

1906
02:15:11,990 --> 02:15:13,970
That's all I want!

1907
02:15:14,370 --> 02:15:16,310
How do I unlock it?

1908
02:15:20,390 --> 02:15:23,590
I'll never unlock the swamp!

1909
02:15:23,590 --> 02:15:29,030
I literally cleaned 73% of this area!

1910
02:15:31,410 --> 02:15:33,210
It is real!

1911
02:15:33,370 --> 02:15:35,350
I saw it in the trailer!

1912
02:15:36,770 --> 02:15:41,910
I just wanna- I just wanna go.

1913
02:15:42,350 --> 02:15:45,290
Somebody once told me the world.

1914
02:15:47,110 --> 02:15:48,770
Give me the swamp.

1915
02:15:48,870 --> 02:15:49,870
I'll take things.

1916
02:15:49,870 --> 02:15:52,370
Why do I want to clean strex's fiona for $500?

1917
02:15:53,410 --> 02:15:54,730
Thank you for the superchat Poppa!

1918
02:15:54,850 --> 02:15:55,790
Thank you, thank you!

1919
02:15:56,050 --> 02:15:57,510
Duck, thank you for the superchat!

1920
02:15:57,730 --> 02:16:00,910
Why do I want to clean strex's swamp so bad?

1921
02:16:01,050 --> 02:16:04,970
Shouldn't use a razor for that instead of a power watcher.

1922
02:16:05,490 --> 02:16:08,590
Thank you for the superchat, Duck.

1923
02:16:08,670 --> 02:16:09,890
Thank you, thank you.

1924
02:16:10,970 --> 02:16:12,590
This was all for the swamp.

1925
02:16:12,870 --> 02:16:16,190
I literally wanted to do the DLC for the swamp.

1926
02:16:16,190 --> 02:16:21,030
And I'm out here fucking cleaning up Shrek's love shack instead.

1927
02:16:21,510 --> 02:16:23,890
Like what the fuck is my life now?

1928
02:16:24,370 --> 02:16:26,030
Cleaning his goddamn

1929
02:16:31,290 --> 02:16:36,130
Goddamn Goddamn Goddamn Fucking snot Quote on quote

1930
02:16:41,680 --> 02:16:54,700
This is like You're the janitor at the special movie Movies that are filmed This is how I feel right now I feel like I feel like that janitor

1931
02:17:01,290 --> 02:17:04,250
Cleaning the gooning shack

1932
02:17:07,930 --> 02:17:14,830
Somebody has to be a janitor for that Like what the Somebody has to clean that

1933
02:17:18,010 --> 02:17:19,490
Sir, thank you for the super chat.

1934
02:17:19,570 --> 02:17:20,790
Thank you, thank you.

1935
02:17:23,210 --> 02:17:24,650
And thank you for the super chat.

1936
02:17:24,770 --> 02:17:25,650
Thank you, thank you.

1937
02:17:25,750 --> 02:17:27,170
Think of the swap as a boss.

1938
02:17:27,250 --> 02:17:28,450
You need to level up first.

1939
02:17:28,570 --> 02:17:30,270
I'm at 80%!

1940
02:17:31,290 --> 02:17:32,530
What more do

1941
02:17:38,020 --> 02:17:42,540
you - Oh my god.

1942
02:17:43,880 --> 02:17:44,320
Please.

1943
02:17:44,580 --> 02:17:47,820
Oh, there was a ladder this entire time?!

1944
02:17:48,260 --> 02:17:50,200
Oh my god, I need to pick one struggle.

1945
02:17:50,200 --> 02:17:50,940
Like-

1946
02:17:54,060 --> 02:17:56,940
How many struggles am I gonna pick?

1947
02:17:57,340 --> 02:17:59,080
How many struggles?

1948
02:18:00,240 --> 02:18:02,180
I'm struggling so much.

1949
02:18:02,780 --> 02:18:06,220
I'm struggling so fucking much right now.

1950
02:18:07,060 --> 02:18:08,180
I give up.

1951
02:18:08,280 --> 02:18:08,920
I can't.

1952
02:18:08,920 --> 02:18:10,660
I can't keep doing- Wait, no.

1953
02:18:10,820 --> 02:18:11,400
No, Doki.

1954
02:18:11,480 --> 02:18:12,260
Never give up.

1955
02:18:12,580 --> 02:18:13,000
Never.

1956
02:18:13,740 --> 02:18:15,060
Never give up, Doki.

1957
02:18:15,960 --> 02:18:17,580
Do it for the swap!

1958
02:18:18,600 --> 02:18:20,700
You don't even have to clean the swap.

1959
02:18:20,840 --> 02:18:22,720
You just have to look at it, Doki.

1960
02:18:23,320 --> 02:18:27,360
Just think about being able to look at that swap!

1961
02:18:31,890 --> 02:18:33,230
Just think about it.

1962
02:18:33,370 --> 02:18:35,610
Just think about being able to look at it.

1963
02:18:35,910 --> 02:18:36,390
That's all.

1964
02:18:36,550 --> 02:18:37,710
That's the end goal.

1965
02:18:38,850 --> 02:18:39,230
Thanks you.

1966
02:18:39,350 --> 02:18:41,430
They'll be able to snot again.

1967
02:18:43,330 --> 02:18:45,610
Thank you for the super chat.

1968
02:18:45,990 --> 02:18:46,910
Thank you, thank you.

1969
02:18:46,910 --> 02:18:49,710
Just think about the swap, Doki.

1970
02:18:50,130 --> 02:18:52,930
Close your eyes and think about the swap.

1971
02:18:55,090 --> 02:18:56,870
All that trauma.

1972
02:18:57,910 --> 02:18:59,910
All that trauma for $60.

1973
02:19:00,670 --> 02:19:02,330
But just think about the swap.

1974
02:19:03,090 --> 02:19:06,130
Push Gaming, thank you for the super chat.

1975
02:19:06,230 --> 02:19:07,170
Thank you, thank you.

1976
02:19:07,330 --> 02:19:09,570
One cannot simply enter the swap.

1977
02:19:09,870 --> 02:19:14,650
One must prove their allegiance and loyalty to the green beast.

1978
02:19:17,670 --> 02:19:19,290
Oh my god, please.

1979
02:19:22,710 --> 02:19:25,310
What else do I have to clean?

1980
02:19:26,650 --> 02:19:28,250
What is there?

1981
02:19:30,590 --> 02:19:32,550
I'm literally at 81%.

1982
02:19:32,550 --> 02:19:35,110
Don't make me do 100%.

1983
02:19:35,110 --> 02:19:37,290
Please don't make me do 100%.

1984
02:19:37,290 --> 02:19:38,290
I beg of you.

1985
02:19:39,550 --> 02:19:42,430
I cannot do this to myself.

1986
02:19:42,650 --> 02:19:45,030
You make me do 100% of this house.

1987
02:19:48,490 --> 02:19:49,050
Alright.

1988
02:19:50,690 --> 02:19:52,930
Just gonna make sure we get the candy in.

1989
02:19:54,970 --> 02:19:56,910
Alright, the candy is all done.

1990
02:19:59,190 --> 02:20:01,530
Why are these stains so difficult?

1991
02:20:02,750 --> 02:20:04,390
Like, I don't understand.

1992
02:20:06,170 --> 02:20:08,910
How could these stains be like this?

1993
02:20:12,070 --> 02:20:13,690
Sharko, thank you for the super chat.

1994
02:20:13,770 --> 02:20:14,690
Thank you, thank you.

1995
02:20:14,690 --> 02:20:16,410
Screw it, I'll ask.

1996
02:20:16,550 --> 02:20:21,210
If Fiona's curse never breaks, how would their kids look like?

1997
02:20:21,250 --> 02:20:23,330
Do they turn half ogre during the night?

1998
02:20:24,310 --> 02:20:25,690
I feel like...

1999
02:20:29,480 --> 02:20:31,460
I mean, there's different types of curses.

2000
02:20:31,800 --> 02:20:33,380
There's generational curses.

2001
02:20:33,640 --> 02:20:37,540
I feel like they'd just be like half ogre, half human hybrids.

2002
02:20:38,380 --> 02:20:39,800
Because the ogre is not her...

2003
02:20:39,800 --> 02:20:45,500
Okay, I think it depends on which form she is in when she gives birth.

2004
02:20:45,500 --> 02:20:52,380
So like, if she's in human form, I guess like the babies will turn human?

2005
02:20:52,800 --> 02:20:55,600
And then when she's in ogre form, then the babies...

2006
02:20:56,060 --> 02:20:57,500
Or like, it'd be like half...

2007
02:20:58,040 --> 02:21:03,760
Or it's... I feel like it could be half ogre, half human hybrids.

2008
02:21:03,900 --> 02:21:06,060
Which would make them like mega freaks too.

2009
02:21:06,980 --> 02:21:11,500
I mean, we got half dragon, half donkey hybrids, so like...

2010
02:21:13,420 --> 02:21:14,920
So like, it's...

2011
02:21:14,920 --> 02:21:16,780
There's no like...

2012
02:21:16,780 --> 02:21:17,960
It could... Okay!

2013
02:21:18,480 --> 02:21:19,060
Also!

2014
02:21:20,360 --> 02:21:22,920
Fiona's dad is a fucking frog.

2015
02:21:23,200 --> 02:21:24,620
And like, she's not a frog.

2016
02:21:24,940 --> 02:21:26,500
So like, I feel like...

2017
02:21:27,020 --> 02:21:30,120
They're not... She's not like a half frog, half human.

2018
02:21:30,800 --> 02:21:31,860
There's that too.

2019
02:21:33,860 --> 02:21:35,860
I'm at 84%... Is it time?

2020
02:21:36,720 --> 02:21:37,720
Do I...

2021
02:21:37,720 --> 02:21:39,920
Do I get the...

2022
02:21:39,920 --> 02:21:41,060

2023
02:21:47,320 --> 02:21:48,720
Please...

2024
02:21:51,160 --> 02:21:51,920

2025
02:21:52,560 --> 02:21:53,260
Trick...

2026
02:21:53,640 --> 02:21:56,920
Please don't do this to me...

2027
02:22:01,720 --> 02:22:03,920
Trick, please...

2028
02:22:05,640 --> 02:22:06,340
Trick...

2029
02:22:07,340 --> 02:22:09,620
One last push...

2030
02:22:10,120 --> 02:22:12,340
Doki, you're so close...

2031
02:22:13,280 --> 02:22:16,340
Doki, one last push...

2032
02:22:22,560 --> 02:22:23,680
Wait...

2033
02:22:23,680 --> 02:22:25,680
What's the saying called?

2034
02:22:27,500 --> 02:22:29,800
Keiji, wait, he's stuck in...

2035
02:22:30,900 --> 02:22:33,340
The last job...

2036
02:22:36,340 --> 02:22:43,340
lol 95% of gamblers...

2037
02:22:43,920 --> 02:22:45,540
lol Gave up...

2038
02:22:45,980 --> 02:22:48,800
Before they hit it big...

2039
02:22:48,800 --> 02:22:50,480
The Weiji cage...

2040
02:22:50,480 --> 02:22:52,340
Dad's Weiji...

2041
02:22:52,340 --> 02:22:54,060
Dad...

2042
02:22:54,060 --> 02:22:59,320
Oh my god...

2043
02:22:59,320 --> 02:23:00,340
Please...

2044
02:23:00,340 --> 02:23:07,240
Weiji, Weiji, stuck in your cage all day long, you sweat and rage...

2045
02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:15,420
This is my life now...

2046
02:23:15,420 --> 02:23:17,340
Cleaning Shrek's...

2047
02:23:20,080 --> 02:23:21,760
Love shack...

2048
02:23:21,760 --> 02:23:24,340
Honestly, my actual job was like...

2049
02:23:25,460 --> 02:23:28,380
My actual job was to be a janitor...

2050
02:23:28,380 --> 02:23:29,340
To clean up...

2051
02:23:30,020 --> 02:23:34,400
Clean up some of Shrek's, you know, fun times...

2052
02:23:34,400 --> 02:23:36,340
Fun freaky times...

2053
02:23:36,920 --> 02:23:39,400
I think I'd be very depressed...

2054
02:23:39,400 --> 02:23:49,340
lol I think I'd definitely be very disassociated in life...

2055
02:23:54,220 --> 02:23:58,420
Oh my god, I went to janitor school for this...

2056
02:23:59,340 --> 02:24:02,260
I'm at 85%, guys...

2057
02:24:02,260 --> 02:24:05,520
One more, oh my god...

2058
02:24:05,520 --> 02:24:09,340
The only way I could get through my job...

2059
02:24:12,190 --> 02:24:14,990
My parents would be so proud of me...

2060
02:24:16,610 --> 02:24:18,810
There's janitor school...

2061
02:24:18,810 --> 02:24:21,170
Of course there is, have you guys not watched Community?

2062
02:24:22,310 --> 02:24:26,530
lol How else would they learn the janitor things?

2063
02:24:32,850 --> 02:24:33,490
Okay...

2064
02:24:33,490 --> 02:24:36,510
I gotta clean up the honeymoon sign...

2065
02:24:36,510 --> 02:24:38,010
So people know...

2066
02:24:38,010 --> 02:24:41,890
People know what the fuck that shack is for...

2067
02:24:43,590 --> 02:24:46,430
Like, why does it have to be 100%?

2068
02:24:47,170 --> 02:24:49,610
Why can't it be like 99%?

2069
02:24:49,710 --> 02:24:51,670
Oh, it's at 86%!

2070
02:24:52,970 --> 02:24:55,310
It's at 86%!

2071
02:24:55,310 --> 02:24:57,310
86%!

2072
02:24:58,870 --> 02:25:01,110
Jonathan, is this why Airbnbs are so...

2073
02:25:01,110 --> 02:25:02,910
Oh, absolutely...

2074
02:25:02,910 --> 02:25:03,270
lol

2075
02:25:06,490 --> 02:25:07,090
Absolutely...

2076
02:25:07,090 --> 02:25:11,030
lol Like, don't think about it...

2077
02:25:11,030 --> 02:25:14,590
Like, Jonathan, thank you for the superchat...

2078
02:25:14,590 --> 02:25:15,170
lol

2079
02:25:18,710 --> 02:25:21,270
Don't think about it too hard, guys...

2080
02:25:21,270 --> 02:25:23,570
Don't think about it too hard, guys...

2081
02:25:23,570 --> 02:25:28,210
lol That is why...

2082
02:25:28,210 --> 02:25:30,230
That is why I will never do Air...

2083
02:25:30,230 --> 02:25:33,390
Okay, to be fair, like, it's the same as hotels...

2084
02:25:33,390 --> 02:25:36,590
But like, I trust hotel cleaning more than air...

2085
02:25:36,590 --> 02:25:38,990
More than random Airbnb cleaners...

2086
02:25:38,990 --> 02:25:40,290
Like, I... fucking...

2087
02:25:40,290 --> 02:25:42,490
I don't know, I feel like...

2088
02:25:42,490 --> 02:25:43,710
I don't know...

2089
02:25:43,710 --> 02:25:47,030
I don't... I feel like people who clean Airbnbs...

2090
02:25:47,030 --> 02:25:48,670
Do not get it as...

2091
02:25:48,670 --> 02:25:49,590
Do not...

2092
02:25:49,590 --> 02:25:52,790
Do not work at it as hard as, like, a hotel cleaner...

2093
02:25:52,790 --> 02:25:59,790
I... lol lol The hotel people have a system...

2094
02:26:00,390 --> 02:26:02,790
I don't know about Airbnbs...

2095
02:26:03,650 --> 02:26:04,830
lol lol

2096
02:26:12,820 --> 02:26:13,600
Alright...

2097
02:26:13,600 --> 02:26:15,200
I didn't do the wheels...

2098
02:26:15,200 --> 02:26:16,240
Why don't they...

2099
02:26:17,720 --> 02:26:19,020
It's a car!

2100
02:26:19,480 --> 02:26:21,420
Nobody cleans the wheels of a car!

2101
02:26:22,220 --> 02:26:24,760
Fucking go to a car wash!

2102
02:26:24,760 --> 02:26:27,860
Go to a goddamn car wash at that point!

2103
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:29,700
I'm not... I'm literally here to clean houses!

2104
02:26:30,400 --> 02:26:31,500
Like, I'm...

2105
02:26:31,500 --> 02:26:33,880
I'm literally here to clean houses!

2106
02:26:34,620 --> 02:26:36,380
I'm not a car washer!

2107
02:26:37,120 --> 02:26:38,520
Like... lol

2108
02:26:44,780 --> 02:26:45,540
Alright...

2109
02:26:46,320 --> 02:26:48,280
I'll go...

2110
02:26:48,280 --> 02:26:50,320
Back at it again...

2111
02:26:53,160 --> 02:27:00,880
Yeah... lol Yeah... lol She's losing it... lol Everything...

2112
02:27:00,880 --> 02:27:02,820
The things I do for the swamp...

2113
02:27:03,280 --> 02:27:04,500
What the fuck?

2114
02:27:04,520 --> 02:27:06,600
You got this part dirty too?

2115
02:27:07,560 --> 02:27:10,160
Oh my god...

2116
02:27:11,100 --> 02:27:12,580
Here we go...

2117
02:27:15,320 --> 02:27:16,520
Oh my god...

2118
02:27:16,520 --> 02:27:22,860
I'm gonna... lol I'm gonna... lol I'm gonna find where Shrek lives...

2119
02:27:22,860 --> 02:27:33,700
Maybe that's why they won't give me the swamp... lol Maybe that's why they don't give me the swamp, guys... lol Maybe that's why...

2120
02:27:33,700 --> 02:27:39,240

2121
02:27:41,880 --> 02:27:42,440
Okay...

2122
02:27:42,440 --> 02:27:47,320
Yeah, I know about sea, I just refuse to use it...

2123
02:27:48,360 --> 02:27:48,920
Okay...

2124
02:27:48,920 --> 02:27:50,860
We're gonna clean that...

2125
02:27:50,860 --> 02:27:52,820
Is this all clean now?

2126
02:27:53,620 --> 02:27:55,040
Did I do it?

2127
02:27:56,640 --> 02:27:57,840
Oh my god...

2128
02:27:57,840 --> 02:27:59,780
There's like the tiniest stains...

2129
02:27:59,780 --> 02:28:00,900
How would they know?

2130
02:28:01,400 --> 02:28:02,540
How would they know?

2131
02:28:04,480 --> 02:28:07,300
Talk, Shrek, right now!

2132
02:28:10,960 --> 02:28:11,720
Okay...

02:28:11,720 --> 02:28:14,560
We're gonna clean this part...

2134

Please...

2137
02:28:22,340 --> 02:28:23,700
I must suffer...

2138
02:28:23,700 --> 02:28:26,800
I must suffer for the swamp...

2139
02:28:26,800 --> 02:28:27,760
I must...

2140
02:28:27,760 --> 02:28:30,520

02:28:33,100 --> 02:28:34,440
I swear to fucking god...

2143
02:28:34,440 --> 02:28:38,020
If we hit 100% and we still don't get the swamp...

2144
02:28:38,020 --> 02:28:38,820
I...

2145
02:28:38,820 --> 02:28:40,440
I swear...

2146
02:28:40,440 --> 02:28:41,640
Guys, I need to know...

2147
02:28:41,640 --> 02:28:44,080
I need to know, guys...

2148
02:28:44,080 --> 02:28:46,660
Do I get the swamp if I finish this job?

2149
02:28:46,660 --> 02:28:49,080
I need to know, chat...

2150
02:28:49,080 --> 02:28:51,360

2153
02:28:53,960 --> 02:28:56,400
Please don't make me do this all...

2154
02:28:57,220 --> 02:28:57,740
Please...

2155
02:28:57,740 --> 02:28:59,300
Don't tell her...

2156
02:29:03,840 --> 02:29:07,100
I just need to know...

2157
02:29:07,100 --> 02:29:08,740
Doki, the game came out today...

2158
02:29:08,740 --> 02:29:10,640
How the fuck were we supposed to know?

2159
02:29:10,700 --> 02:29:11,620
I don't know!

2160
02:29:12,480 --> 02:29:13,420
I just...

2161
02:29:13,420 --> 02:29:14,840
I need something!

2162
02:29:15,400 --> 02:29:16,860
I need a reassurance!

2163
02:29:33,800 --> 02:29:36,840
Get the devs right now in my chat!

2164
02:29:38,940 --> 02:29:40,880
No, don't get the devs...

2165
02:29:40,880 --> 02:29:42,080
Don't get the devs...

2166
02:29:42,080 --> 02:29:44,000
Someone ping the chat right now!

2167
02:29:46,940 --> 02:29:49,800
Someone ping the devs right now on discord!

2168
02:29:52,080 --> 02:29:54,460
They must be in the server somewhere.

2169
02:29:56,560 --> 02:30:00,160
She wants to talk to the manager.

2170
02:30:08,690 --> 02:30:11,450
Oh my god...

2171
02:30:11,450 --> 02:30:13,470
This is hell...

2172
02:30:13,470 --> 02:30:16,510
It's all like, small stains of hell right now.

2173
02:30:17,010 --> 02:30:22,210
Literally all these small stains have added up to...

2174
02:30:22,210 --> 02:30:25,510
have added up to nine... the hundred percent.

2175
02:30:26,110 --> 02:30:29,470
I'm actually like, in Dante's Infernal right now.

2176
02:30:30,270 --> 02:30:31,090
Like, I...

2177
02:30:31,750 --> 02:30:32,950
This is the worst part.

2178
02:30:33,150 --> 02:30:38,610
I can't believe... I thought that like, you know, oh, maybe it has to be like the general amount.

2179
02:30:39,230 --> 02:30:43,050
Maybe it's like the general amount, and then like, if I could, I would pay to win.

2180
02:30:43,050 --> 02:30:47,130
If I could, I would pay like, if they made me pay a hundred dollars to unlock the swamp, I would do it.

2181
02:30:47,290 --> 02:30:50,330
I'll pay fucking a hundred real dollar runies just to unlock the swamp.

2182
02:30:50,810 --> 02:30:51,210
Anyway...

2183
02:30:57,210 --> 02:30:57,610
Anyway...

2184
02:31:03,450 --> 02:31:08,150
I thought that like, if I clean a general amount, I would...

2185
02:31:08,550 --> 02:31:09,970
I would get the...

2186
02:31:10,770 --> 02:31:12,290
I would... I would get it.

2187
02:31:12,390 --> 02:31:14,650
So I just half-assed it.

2188
02:31:15,290 --> 02:31:17,930
I just cleaned... just to clean to hit forty percent.

2189
02:31:18,290 --> 02:31:19,750
Cause that's how we got the honeymoon!

2190
02:31:20,270 --> 02:31:23,310
We literally... we literally cleaned forty percent!

2191
02:31:23,750 --> 02:31:25,010
And it got the honeymoon!

2192
02:31:25,450 --> 02:31:26,790
So I don't understand!

2193
02:31:27,450 --> 02:31:28,450
I don't understand!

2194
02:31:28,630 --> 02:31:30,530
I did all that and only hit ninety-two percent.

2195
02:31:30,770 --> 02:31:32,750
I didn't... I... oh... I...

2196
02:31:32,750 --> 02:31:33,950
Oh, she's...

2197
02:31:35,630 --> 02:31:38,050
Like, I barely went up.

2198
02:31:38,270 --> 02:31:40,590
It barely went up in the fucking clean-o-meter.

2199
02:31:40,790 --> 02:31:41,850
Like, I don't understand.

2200
02:31:42,110 --> 02:31:43,550
Why did it barely go up?

2201
02:31:43,810 --> 02:31:45,990
I... I'm still stuck in that little gap.

2202
02:31:46,130 --> 02:31:48,950
That little fucking gap hole of ninety-two percent.

2203
02:31:51,110 --> 02:31:52,950
She's losing it, chat.

2204
02:31:53,230 --> 02:31:55,110
We're losing it.

2205
02:31:55,390 --> 02:31:56,230
I'm gonna...

2206
02:31:56,760 --> 02:31:59,890
Oh my god, the moment I find where you live, Shrek.

2207
02:32:00,010 --> 02:32:02,630
The moment I fucking find your swamp.

2208
02:32:02,750 --> 02:32:03,910
It's so over.

2209
02:32:04,170 --> 02:32:06,750
It's so fucking over.

2210
02:32:07,490 --> 02:32:09,290
It's so...

2211
02:32:09,290 --> 02:32:13,150
I NEED A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY PERCENT?!

2212
02:32:27,020 --> 02:32:28,060
Oh my god.

2213
02:32:28,440 --> 02:32:29,740
Oh my god.

2214
02:32:30,700 --> 02:32:32,280
Oh my god.

2215
02:32:37,360 --> 02:32:39,920
I don't know if I can do that.

2216
02:32:40,920 --> 02:32:43,980
We barely hit ninety-three-hundred.

2217
02:32:45,780 --> 02:32:47,240
I don't know.

2218
02:32:47,900 --> 02:32:50,240
I don't know if we can...

2219
02:32:51,380 --> 02:32:52,480
I don't know.

2220
02:32:52,700 --> 02:32:55,980
I don't know if that's something we can do.

2221
02:32:59,320 --> 02:33:00,580
We gotta...

2222
02:33:00,580 --> 02:33:02,300
Guys, this is...

2223
02:33:02,300 --> 02:33:04,220
We gotta go to the other map, guys.

2224
02:33:04,280 --> 02:33:05,360
It's the only way.

2225
02:33:08,320 --> 02:33:10,280
It's the only way.

2226
02:33:10,400 --> 02:33:12,860
See, it's literally the only way.

2227
02:33:13,760 --> 02:33:14,540
We had it.

2228
02:33:14,700 --> 02:33:15,380
We got it.

2229
02:33:16,420 --> 02:33:18,400
Guys, we just need forty percent.

2230
02:33:19,240 --> 02:33:20,040
We just...

2231
02:33:20,040 --> 02:33:20,600
Guys.

2232
02:33:21,620 --> 02:33:23,820
Guys, we just need forty percent.

2233
02:33:26,380 --> 02:33:27,800
We can do it.

2234
02:33:30,500 --> 02:33:31,540
We can...

2235
02:33:31,540 --> 02:33:33,140
We can do it, I believe.

2236
02:33:33,340 --> 02:33:34,660
It's just forty percent.

2237
02:33:35,680 --> 02:33:36,280
What?

2238
02:33:44,710 --> 02:33:46,490
No, don't tell me I got one, god.

2239
02:33:51,040 --> 02:33:52,020
Guys, please.

2240
02:33:52,840 --> 02:33:54,280
Please, it's just...

2241
02:33:54,280 --> 02:33:55,320
There's no way.

2242
02:33:56,840 --> 02:33:58,060
There's no way.

2243
02:33:58,520 --> 02:33:59,600
We're so close.

2244
02:33:59,680 --> 02:34:01,520
Okay, we can do this.

2245
02:34:03,760 --> 02:34:05,320
We can hit that...

2246
02:34:05,320 --> 02:34:06,820
The sweet-o spot.

2247
02:34:07,140 --> 02:34:08,100
We'll just keep going.

2248
02:34:10,100 --> 02:34:11,340
We'll keep going.

2249
02:34:12,580 --> 02:34:13,900
This has to be...

2250
02:34:13,900 --> 02:34:15,000
This will be like...

2251
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:16,960
This will be the fastest...

2252
02:34:16,960 --> 02:34:18,560
Seventy percent of our lives.

2253
02:34:18,660 --> 02:34:19,380
We just need to hit eighty.

2254
02:34:19,620 --> 02:34:21,020
We just need to hit eighty, guys.

2255
02:34:21,240 --> 02:34:22,560
We're already at eighty percent.

2256
02:34:22,680 --> 02:34:23,680
We're already at fifty.

2257
02:34:24,360 --> 02:34:25,360
We just...

2258
02:34:25,900 --> 02:34:26,740
There's no way.

2259
02:34:27,100 --> 02:34:27,980
Okay, that guy...

2260
02:34:27,980 --> 02:34:29,000
Okay, who said that?

2261
02:34:29,360 --> 02:34:30,020
Okay, mods.

2262
02:34:30,140 --> 02:34:31,860
Who said a hundred and seventy percent?

2263
02:34:32,380 --> 02:34:33,040
Okay, okay.

2264
02:34:33,720 --> 02:34:34,020
You.

2265
02:34:35,660 --> 02:34:36,140
You.

2266
02:34:39,160 --> 02:34:39,640
You.

2267
02:34:39,960 --> 02:34:42,320
Okay, I wrote this down so I remember.

2268
02:34:42,320 --> 02:34:44,030
If it's not...

2269
02:34:47,440 --> 02:34:50,180
I swear to God.

2270
02:34:52,460 --> 02:34:57,700
Alright, this is the size of your fate.

2271
02:35:01,990 --> 02:35:03,780
All I'm saying...

2272
02:35:03,780 --> 02:35:08,340
Is that bad button looks really fucking pretty right now.

2273
02:35:09,600 --> 02:35:11,080
It's on...

2274
02:35:13,260 --> 02:35:15,000
All I'm saying...

2275
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:17,620
Is that that bad button...

2276
02:35:17,620 --> 02:35:23,320
Oh, if I hit that eighty percent...

2277
02:35:26,280 --> 02:35:27,760
I'm not playing.

2278
02:35:27,900 --> 02:35:30,020
I'm not playing right now.

2279
02:35:32,160 --> 02:35:32,800
Okay.

2280
02:35:33,400 --> 02:35:34,720
We're new fast, so like...

2281
02:35:35,720 --> 02:35:36,660
We're gonna hit that.

2282
02:35:36,740 --> 02:35:40,000
She's going crazy with power.

2283
02:35:40,420 --> 02:35:41,700
Okay, wait, give me a sec.

2284
02:35:41,800 --> 02:35:42,220
Let me...

2285
02:35:42,320 --> 02:35:44,120
Let me find that message again.

2286
02:35:44,240 --> 02:35:44,720
Let me...

2287
02:35:45,760 --> 02:35:47,140
Oh, you're so lucky.

2288
02:35:47,520 --> 02:35:48,380
You are so lucky.

2289
02:35:48,440 --> 02:35:49,400
I can't find...

2290
02:35:49,400 --> 02:35:51,340
I can't find that message again.

2291
02:35:51,700 --> 02:35:52,320
But like...

2292
02:35:54,920 --> 02:35:58,220
I was gonna put you up there on the screen.

2293
02:35:59,160 --> 02:36:00,480
As like a countdown.

2294
02:36:01,260 --> 02:36:01,720
It's like...

2295
02:36:06,200 --> 02:36:10,600
I was gonna give a little countdown on what it will be like if it's not true.

2296
02:36:12,320 --> 02:36:13,460
Oh my god.

2297
02:36:13,500 --> 02:36:14,120
This is...

2298
02:36:15,320 --> 02:36:16,760
This is gonna take...

2299
02:36:16,760 --> 02:36:17,800
There's no way.

2300
02:36:18,220 --> 02:36:20,000
There's no way.

2301
02:36:20,120 --> 02:36:22,960
Like how long is this gonna take me?

2302
02:36:23,600 --> 02:36:25,980
There's no fucking way.

2303
02:36:26,200 --> 02:36:27,040
Almost.

2304
02:36:27,920 --> 02:36:29,340
You're almost fifty.

2305
02:36:29,680 --> 02:36:31,080
You're almost there!

2306
02:36:32,380 --> 02:36:34,260
Okay, I'm fucking...

2307
02:36:34,260 --> 02:36:37,200
We're bringing in the big boys for this.

2308
02:36:37,740 --> 02:36:39,320
It might not be the cleanest.

2309
02:36:39,770 --> 02:36:43,300
But like the range is higher and that's all that matters for me.

2310
02:36:45,480 --> 02:36:47,360
That's all that matters.

2311
02:36:48,620 --> 02:36:52,300
Oh, you're awfully quiet, Ikemia.

2312
02:36:52,760 --> 02:36:53,160
You're...

2313
02:36:53,160 --> 02:36:54,780
Oh, you're awfully quiet.

2314
02:36:54,840 --> 02:36:55,820
You're fucking sweating.

2315
02:36:56,460 --> 02:36:56,810
You're...

2316
02:36:59,300 --> 02:37:03,800
You seem awfully quiet right now in my fucking chat.

2317
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,240
I don't see you talking no more.

2318
02:37:06,240 --> 02:37:10,380
I don't see you talking no more.

2319
02:37:14,660 --> 02:37:15,780
They ran.

2320
02:37:16,180 --> 02:37:18,520
The silence is deafening.

2321
02:37:21,900 --> 02:37:22,460
Okay.

2322
02:37:23,260 --> 02:37:23,600
I guess...

2323
02:37:23,600 --> 02:37:28,860
I know it's not very pretty right now, but I'm trying to do it as fastly as I can.

2324
02:37:30,660 --> 02:37:33,980
Try getting the first area to 50% or I have...

2325
02:37:33,980 --> 02:37:34,680
Don't worry, I have it.

2326
02:37:36,860 --> 02:37:38,160
But thank you for the super chat.

2327
02:37:38,260 --> 02:37:38,640
Thank you.

2328
02:37:38,700 --> 02:37:39,340
Thank you.

2329
02:37:39,360 --> 02:37:40,740
You never came back.

2330
02:37:40,940 --> 02:37:41,920
We don't think you're safe.

2331
02:37:42,660 --> 02:37:43,100
Fucking...

2332
02:37:43,100 --> 02:37:45,120
I don't know if you know this, Ikemia.

2333
02:37:45,460 --> 02:37:51,920
But like you can look back into the VODs and then you can timestamp for timestamp where he says 170%.

2334
02:37:51,920 --> 02:37:55,060
And then you can look back and look at chat replay.

2335
02:37:55,420 --> 02:37:57,760
And then you can ban them from chat replay.

2336
02:37:57,900 --> 02:37:58,740
That's all I...

2337
02:38:02,160 --> 02:38:07,300
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA You think you can get away just cause you haven't chatted now?

2338
02:38:07,700 --> 02:38:12,200
You think you can get away cause I haven't chatted now?

2339
02:38:13,900 --> 02:38:16,720
All I'm saying is that I can do chat replay.

2340
02:38:18,240 --> 02:38:20,020
She's got her plan.

2341
02:38:20,500 --> 02:38:22,760
I have my plan right now.

2342
02:38:22,820 --> 02:38:24,380
If it's not 170...

2343
02:38:24,380 --> 02:38:26,620
Oh, I'm ready.

2344
02:38:26,620 --> 02:38:28,720
I'm fucking ready.

2345
02:38:29,580 --> 02:38:31,340
I'm locked in.

2346
02:38:32,220 --> 02:38:34,740
There's always a record.

2347
02:38:39,520 --> 02:38:42,980
Guys this was not supposed to be three hours of power wash simulator.

2348
02:38:43,240 --> 02:38:48,860
I literally have another stream in two hours guys, but like I need to unlock the swap.

2349
02:38:49,120 --> 02:38:50,680
I need to- don't understand.

2350
02:38:50,880 --> 02:38:52,280
I need to unlock the swap.

2351
02:38:52,540 --> 02:38:54,840
This was my entire reason for being here.

2352
02:38:54,840 --> 02:39:03,060
I'm literally playing the game for the fucking- I made the somebody joke two times on social media!

2353
02:39:03,860 --> 02:39:10,480
And I- it would be so embarrassing if I don't get the swap after I made that joke two times on social media.

2354
02:39:10,740 --> 02:39:12,840
Like, it's all I have.

2355
02:39:13,200 --> 02:39:13,860
It's-

2356
02:39:20,580 --> 02:39:22,560
Well, thank you for the super chat.

2357
02:39:22,660 --> 02:39:23,840
Thank you, thank you.

2358
02:39:25,440 --> 02:39:30,060
Completing individuals up to ding makes your perfect percent raise faster and will save your insanity.

2359
02:39:30,440 --> 02:39:31,400
Oh my god.

2360
02:39:31,580 --> 02:39:32,880
Oh my god, this is it.

2361
02:39:33,100 --> 02:39:34,220
This is what I needed.

2362
02:39:34,840 --> 02:39:36,640
Don't worry, I'll complete the flower pot.

2363
02:39:38,620 --> 02:39:40,460
Why is the flower pot not dinging?

2364
02:39:41,360 --> 02:39:44,920
Why is the- why is the fucking window not- oh there we go.

2365
02:39:45,480 --> 02:39:47,140
There we go, 53%.

2366
02:39:47,140 --> 02:39:49,820
Okay, we got the flower.

2367
02:39:51,200 --> 02:39:53,700
Oh my god, what is the easiest for the ding?

2368
02:39:54,940 --> 02:39:58,340
Thank you for your very fifth- your fifth super chat, man.

2369
02:39:58,400 --> 02:40:00,140
Thank you, thank you.

2370
02:40:00,420 --> 02:40:06,560
She went- skipped the other parts of grief and went straight for the hit.

2371
02:40:10,100 --> 02:40:10,740
Okay.

2372
02:40:11,720 --> 02:40:13,140
Okay, we got the window.

2373
02:40:13,300 --> 02:40:14,740
We're at 54.

2374
02:40:16,080 --> 02:40:17,680
Oh my god.

2375
02:40:21,080 --> 02:40:22,340
Okay, I can't.

2376
02:40:22,380 --> 02:40:23,340
Oh my god, please.

2377
02:40:23,900 --> 02:40:24,600
Please.

2378
02:40:25,020 --> 02:40:26,680
We gotta at least clean this door.

2379
02:40:27,760 --> 02:40:29,860
It went ding, but why?

2380
02:40:30,160 --> 02:40:33,500
It went ding, but why is it still 54?

2381
02:40:35,220 --> 02:40:37,160
I don't understand!

2382
02:40:38,960 --> 02:40:40,500
I was told!

2383
02:40:41,440 --> 02:40:43,980
I was told it would go

2384
02:40:48,710 --> 02:40:57,670
- I've been lied to.

2385
02:40:59,450 --> 02:41:02,050
It's still at 54.

2386
02:41:03,090 --> 02:41:06,750
Toki, it's a city and you clean one door.

2387
02:41:07,150 --> 02:41:10,030
But they said- they said the ding!

2388
02:41:10,570 --> 02:41:13,150
The ding will make it go faster!

2389
02:41:14,090 --> 02:41:23,470
Poor Toki can't even unlock the s- Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

2390
02:41:24,610 --> 02:41:26,130
Who are these people?

2391
02:41:26,410 --> 02:41:28,290
I hope they've all been executed!

2392
02:41:31,530 --> 02:41:33,190
Oh my god, Toki can't just say that.

2393
02:41:33,450 --> 02:41:35,410
Guys, it's ye olde medieval times!

2394
02:41:35,890 --> 02:41:37,130
It was the norm!

2395
02:41:41,190 --> 02:41:44,950
That's what they do in the ye olde medieval times!

2396
02:41:48,730 --> 02:41:49,950
Okay, here we go.

2397
02:41:50,350 --> 02:41:53,470
Toki's becoming Lord Farquaad.

2398
02:41:54,430 --> 02:41:55,870
Oh my god, please.

2399
02:41:56,590 --> 02:42:01,490
Oh my god, I just- I don't know, I don't know.

2400
02:42:01,710 --> 02:42:10,130
I don't know how much longer- I thought that getting to 80% would be like so easy, but it's not.

2401
02:42:10,870 --> 02:42:11,590
It's not.

2402
02:42:11,770 --> 02:42:14,430
Doing this was easier than the dings!

2403
02:42:15,570 --> 02:42:20,050
Holy shit, actually doing that was- doing that actually made more progress.

2404
02:42:20,050 --> 02:42:21,710
Where's my giant ladder?

2405
02:42:22,170 --> 02:42:23,910
Where the fuck is my giant ladder?

2406
02:42:24,730 --> 02:42:25,110
Okay.

2407
02:42:31,690 --> 02:42:37,150
Okay, we're just gonna clean as much as we can to make it to-

2408
02:42:40,170 --> 02:42:42,150
To make it- we just need 80%.

2409
02:42:42,150 --> 02:42:45,690
We literally- we literally just need 80%.

2410
02:42:47,290 --> 02:42:48,870
What do you mean you didn't lie?

2411
02:42:49,090 --> 02:42:52,630
You guys told me to just clean individual spots until you hear the ding!

2412
02:42:52,630 --> 02:42:56,710
But me just doing this made it go faster!

2413
02:42:57,230 --> 02:42:58,990
I already am at 57%!

2414
02:43:01,450 --> 02:43:07,510
I'm literally at 57% because I'm just- I'm just going- rolling in with the times!

2415
02:43:11,330 --> 02:43:13,550
Oh my god, and then we'll clean this like this.

2416
02:43:14,370 --> 02:43:16,930
We'll just be like, it's alright clean.

2417
02:43:17,430 --> 02:43:19,070
It's alright clean.

2418
02:43:19,330 --> 02:43:20,670
It's clean enough.

2419
02:43:21,310 --> 02:43:22,810
Oh my god, please.

2420
02:43:22,930 --> 02:43:25,670
I can't even hit 60%.

2421
02:43:25,670 --> 02:43:29,950
I can't- I can't- Oh my god.

2422
02:43:32,630 --> 02:43:41,150
Oh my god, we're like 20- we're almost 20%.

2423
02:43:44,050 --> 02:43:47,970
I'm actually at- I don't even know where did I started.

2424
02:43:48,290 --> 02:43:53,790
What was my percentage before going in?

2425
02:43:54,010 --> 02:43:56,370
Like, did I even made any progress?

2426
02:44:01,990 --> 02:44:03,830
Oh my god.

2427
02:44:05,090 --> 02:44:10,210
Did I- did I even made- I made 10% progress?

2428
02:44:13,370 --> 02:44:20,570
Guys, I don't know if you guys know this, but like, Power Wash Simulator is supposed to be a relaxing game.

2429
02:44:21,050 --> 02:44:27,810
Guys, and I def- I don't know about you guys, but like, is this the feeling of relaxation?

2430
02:44:28,430 --> 02:44:36,370
Is- Is this- is this what relaxation is supposed to feel?

2431
02:44:37,470 --> 02:44:41,050
I suppose you'd be wondering why I didn't go and rescue my betrothed personally.

2432
02:44:42,090 --> 02:44:42,850
Farquhar, please.

2433
02:44:43,810 --> 02:44:52,230
Please, I would- You send me another text message, I'll go up to the castle myself and fucking throw you off the castle.

2434
02:44:52,230 --> 02:45:02,170
I- and then I'll clean the mess up because I learned in Crime Scene Killer- Crime Scene Cleaner how to hide- how to hide a crime.

2435
02:45:05,550 --> 02:45:07,610
Thomas, thank you for the super chat.

2436
02:45:07,750 --> 02:45:08,950
Thank you, thank you.

2437
02:45:09,490 --> 02:45:10,870
Where did it end?

2438
02:45:11,370 --> 02:45:12,810
Where did it begin?

2439
02:45:13,470 --> 02:45:16,010
I don't even know the washing and stains.

2440
02:45:17,250 --> 02:45:21,870
The washing and the stains, the face, blue eyes, face, blue eyes.

2441
02:45:22,470 --> 02:45:24,970
Thomas, thank you for the super chat.

2442
02:45:25,050 --> 02:45:26,530
Thank you, thank you.

2443
02:45:28,590 --> 02:45:35,710
All I'm saying, that in order to have- in order for Crime Scene Cleaner to happen, somebody had to be killed.

2444
02:45:35,710 --> 02:45:36,090
What?

2445
02:45:38,530 --> 02:45:48,250
Sorry, oh my god, it's so unfortunate that there was an- there was an accident with Lord Farquhar where he just happened to just fall off the building.

2446
02:45:48,530 --> 02:45:50,530
That- oh, that's so fucking crazy.

2447
02:45:51,230 --> 02:45:53,530
That's- well, thoughts and prayers.

2448
02:45:55,970 --> 02:45:57,690
Soma, thank you for the super chat.

2449
02:45:57,750 --> 02:45:58,470
Thank you, thank you.

2450
02:45:58,570 --> 02:46:01,550
What a nice, relaxing game.

2451
02:46:06,630 --> 02:46:10,190
The what-if scenario.

2452
02:46:12,570 --> 02:46:15,710
Oh my god, 61%.

2453
02:46:19,580 --> 02:46:23,170
Guys, this already looks so clean.

2454
02:46:23,590 --> 02:46:24,830
Okay.

2455
02:46:29,810 --> 02:46:31,250
I'll clean this.

2456
02:46:34,780 --> 02:46:36,220
And then...

2457
02:46:36,220 --> 02:46:38,120
It's just a little more.

2458
02:46:39,040 --> 02:46:40,960
We're at 62%.

2459
02:46:40,960 --> 02:46:43,360
We're so close to the percent.

2460
02:46:43,820 --> 02:46:47,440
We just- the moment I see that 70%, I'll know my goal.

2461
02:46:48,360 --> 02:46:53,160
I'll know my goal the moment I see that 70%.

2462
02:46:53,920 --> 02:46:56,040
Then I know what I fought for.

2463
02:46:56,220 --> 02:46:57,520
Do it for the swamp!

2464
02:46:59,200 --> 02:47:01,840
Do it for Team Fortress 2 Scout!

2465
02:47:04,080 --> 02:47:05,060
Was it Scout?

2466
02:47:05,280 --> 02:47:06,000
Or was it Heavy?

2467
02:47:06,640 --> 02:47:07,460
I don't remember.

2468
02:47:08,540 --> 02:47:09,180
No, it wasn't.

2469
02:47:09,240 --> 02:47:12,820
It was Nick from Left 4 Dead 2.

2470
02:47:13,580 --> 02:47:15,200
Do it for Nick from Left 4 Dead 2.

2471
02:47:15,340 --> 02:47:15,740
That's it.

2472
02:47:24,140 --> 02:47:25,420
It was Ellis.

2473
02:47:25,620 --> 02:47:26,560
Oh my god.

2474
02:47:27,040 --> 02:47:28,060
Do it for Ellis.

2475
02:47:29,420 --> 02:47:31,820
Sorry, I got Nick and Ellis confused.

2476
02:47:32,340 --> 02:47:33,540
It was Ellis.

2477
02:47:33,780 --> 02:47:34,460
Do it for him.

2478
02:47:35,860 --> 02:47:38,100
Just remember what he did for us.

2479
02:47:38,760 --> 02:47:39,660
Do it for him.

2480
02:47:40,720 --> 02:47:46,180
Wait, what do I- Does this get rid of the-okay, it does.

2481
02:47:46,220 --> 02:47:47,220
It gets rid of the cock.

2482
02:47:49,260 --> 02:47:51,100
Get your head out of the gutter, guys.

2483
02:47:51,980 --> 02:47:53,940
That's what roosters are called.

2484
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:59,000
I think that's-oh, that's why it's a rooster!

2485
02:47:59,860 --> 02:48:02,260
Wait, that's so clever!

2486
02:48:03,720 --> 02:48:06,120
It's supposed to do a triad!

2487
02:48:07,520 --> 02:48:09,620
That's actually-okay, not gonna lie.

2488
02:48:09,800 --> 02:48:13,000
That's actually so clever that they, like...

2489
02:48:15,680 --> 02:48:20,800
That they drew, like, a rooster to symbolize, like...

2490
02:48:20,800 --> 02:48:23,500
To symbolize the peepee graffiti.

2491
02:48:24,660 --> 02:48:26,020
That's so clever.

2492
02:48:31,040 --> 02:48:31,680
Oh yeah!

2493
02:48:32,280 --> 02:48:33,860
I think-wait, has it been announced?

2494
02:48:33,960 --> 02:48:38,400
Oh yeah, so there's gonna be a-by the way, it's been announced, but...

2495
02:48:38,400 --> 02:48:42,520
There's gonna be a new-that's a sponsored tournament I'm doing on Sunday.

2496
02:48:42,840 --> 02:48:47,920
It's a Stranova tournament, so I got sponsored to be part of it.

2497
02:48:48,800 --> 02:48:49,880
They paid a lot.

2498
02:48:51,880 --> 02:48:53,320
So I was like, okay.

2499
02:48:56,780 --> 02:48:57,260
Cool.

2500
02:48:58,120 --> 02:48:59,680
I dragged Surefour in.

2501
02:49:01,480 --> 02:49:02,440
So, like...

2502
02:49:03,460 --> 02:49:06,000
That's the only person I know that's in my team.

2503
02:49:06,240 --> 02:49:07,320
Because they were like, oh!

2504
02:49:08,820 --> 02:49:13,840
You can bring, like, another content creator to also get sponsored.

2505
02:49:14,920 --> 02:49:17,000
So then I was like, alright, Surefour, you wanna join?

2506
02:49:17,300 --> 02:49:18,640
And he's like, yeah, sure.

2507
02:49:21,780 --> 02:49:25,140
So and then they're like, oh yeah, and then the other teams is just like...

2508
02:49:25,740 --> 02:49:30,760
Basically, the other teammates are just like people who bring, like, people assigned to my team.

2509
02:49:31,980 --> 02:49:34,600
Because, like, technically I'm the captain of the team.

2510
02:49:39,180 --> 02:49:45,180
Technically I'm, like, the captain of the team, so, like, but, like, I-fucking, I was like, I don't know, I was like, fucking, I don't know.

2511
02:49:48,580 --> 02:49:49,920
I was like...

2512
02:49:49,920 --> 02:49:50,880
I was like, I mean, sweet.

2513
02:49:53,880 --> 02:49:57,160
Last time I played, I did it for free, now I got paid for it, let's go.

2514
02:49:57,500 --> 02:49:58,520
Let's fucking go.

2515
02:50:03,900 --> 02:50:07,200
I mean...

2516
02:50:07,200 --> 02:50:10,960
My favorite capitalistic, oh shit.

2517
02:50:12,700 --> 02:50:17,020
Look, I don't have the, guys, look, I don't have the MrBeast money, guys.

2518
02:50:18,500 --> 02:50:20,120
I take what I can get.

2519
02:50:20,440 --> 02:50:26,200
And MrBeast comes up to me and was like, oh yeah, you wanna join this thing for $500,000?

2520
02:50:26,700 --> 02:50:29,620
You know you're fucking, you bet your ass I'd say yes.

2521
02:50:31,560 --> 02:50:34,580
Just like all of you guys would too.

2522
02:50:37,320 --> 02:50:41,200
Don't lie, you guys would have done the same thing.

2523
02:50:51,280 --> 02:50:52,920
I would not!

2524
02:50:56,640 --> 02:51:03,540
I'm gonna sign you up for a MrBeast thing right now, and you're gonna try and prove, and I wanna see you prove my point.

2525
02:51:04,780 --> 02:51:12,880
I'm gonna fucking message MrBeast and be like, hey, can you send this person an, I'm gonna create a fake MrBeast account, and then like, send you a DM.

2526
02:51:12,880 --> 02:51:13,440
And...

2527
02:51:19,450 --> 02:51:26,090
I'm gonna make a fake MrBeast account, send you a YouTube channel DM, and be like, hey, you wanna join, right?

2528
02:51:26,350 --> 02:51:28,470
Just to see if you would say yes or no.

2529
02:51:29,850 --> 02:51:34,630
And I'll make it so fucking real that you wouldn't know, that you wouldn't know.

2530
02:51:34,710 --> 02:51:40,730
And now you're gonna be so paranoid, cause you're like, what if you actually rejected a real MrBeast invite?

2531
02:51:41,730 --> 02:51:43,810
Oh no, she's scheming.

2532
02:51:49,600 --> 02:51:51,180
Oh my god, we're at 67.

2533
02:51:51,900 --> 02:51:53,920
How much do I need, chat?

2534
02:51:54,680 --> 02:51:55,780
How much?

2535
02:51:57,020 --> 02:52:00,200
Not the beast maxing.

2536
02:52:02,740 --> 02:52:03,620
78.

2537
02:52:04,740 --> 02:52:06,600
We're so, we're almost there.

2538
02:52:07,020 --> 02:52:10,300
We're almost at the 70 mark, guys.

2539
02:52:11,200 --> 02:52:14,300
The liar bar has changed.

2540
02:52:15,460 --> 02:52:18,460
Power washing has changed me.

2541
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:22,620
And all it took was one day.

2542
02:52:23,160 --> 02:52:24,620
One bad day.

2543
02:52:28,360 --> 02:52:30,700
That's all it takes, guys.

2544
02:52:30,980 --> 02:52:33,780
One bad day at power washing.

2545
02:52:42,620 --> 02:52:44,020
Oh my god, you know what's funny?

2546
02:52:44,020 --> 02:52:52,680
Speaking of Joker, apparently it's almost equivalent, Joker 2 earnings is almost equivalent to Morbius.

2547
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:54,320
Which is saying a lot.

2548
02:52:55,140 --> 02:52:57,480
Because at least Morbius, you have the memes.

2549
02:52:58,200 --> 02:53:00,280
But like, what do we have in Joker 2?

2550
02:53:00,940 --> 02:53:03,820
To be fair, I never watched the first Joker movie.

2551
02:53:04,140 --> 02:53:06,880
Because like, I normally never watch depressing movies.

2552
02:53:07,400 --> 02:53:09,820
So like, I tend to avoid these types of movies.

2553
02:53:10,480 --> 02:53:13,520
So like, I, in my opinion, I just don't care.

2554
02:53:13,520 --> 02:53:16,760
Like, in my opinion.

2555
02:53:17,840 --> 02:53:29,740
Oh yeah, and apparently the reason why it's so bad is because the director has like, the director has literally no control over the movie this time around.

2556
02:53:32,120 --> 02:53:34,600
So that's why it's so fucking bad.

2557
02:53:34,860 --> 02:53:39,060
The director literally had no control on what to do with the movie for the second movie.

2558
02:53:39,060 --> 02:53:43,220
So it was mostly controlled by the guy who played Joker.

2559
02:53:43,840 --> 02:53:48,000
And also the board.

2560
02:53:51,020 --> 02:53:52,020
How is that possible?

2561
02:53:52,340 --> 02:53:54,240
That's basically all superhero movies.

2562
02:53:54,720 --> 02:53:57,960
So there's gonna be like a parody show.

2563
02:53:58,780 --> 02:54:01,100
I don't know if you guys saw the trailer for it.

2564
02:54:02,540 --> 02:54:02,940
Um...

2565
02:54:07,670 --> 02:54:08,070
Um...

2566
02:54:08,070 --> 02:54:08,810
And like...

2567
02:54:09,730 --> 02:54:10,130
Uh...

2568
02:54:10,130 --> 02:54:11,470
Oh yeah, what's the exact opposite?

2569
02:54:11,650 --> 02:54:13,810
I thought I heard that he...

2570
02:54:14,790 --> 02:54:16,130
The director had full control?

2571
02:54:16,290 --> 02:54:16,890
Didn't they say...

2572
02:54:19,250 --> 02:54:19,650
Uh...

2573
02:54:20,170 --> 02:54:21,410
It's not the opposite?

2574
02:54:21,670 --> 02:54:23,990
Oh shit, I thought he didn't have any control.

2575
02:54:28,070 --> 02:54:29,550
I thought, like, there was like...

2576
02:54:29,550 --> 02:54:30,270
Um...

2577
02:54:30,270 --> 02:54:30,850
There were like...

2578
02:54:31,750 --> 02:54:32,150
Uh...

2579
02:54:32,150 --> 02:54:34,190
I don't know, it's like all over the place.

2580
02:54:35,850 --> 02:54:37,450
I saw it was the director and...

2581
02:54:37,450 --> 02:54:39,250
Oh, it's the director and the lead actor.

2582
02:54:39,330 --> 02:54:40,230
I thought it was like...

2583
02:54:40,230 --> 02:54:42,070
There was like a source that said like...

2584
02:54:43,610 --> 02:54:44,090
Uh...

2585
02:54:44,090 --> 02:54:45,930
Oh, the director is different!

2586
02:54:46,190 --> 02:54:46,750
Oh, okay.

2587
02:54:47,270 --> 02:54:48,530
I thought it was the same director.

2588
02:54:55,950 --> 02:54:56,710
It had a lot of control.

2589
02:54:56,790 --> 02:54:58,770
Everything that happened was signed for by him.

2590
02:54:58,970 --> 02:55:00,410
Cause I was thinking about like...

2591
02:55:00,410 --> 02:55:01,510
Cause I saw like...

2592
02:55:01,510 --> 02:55:02,050
Uh...

2593
02:55:02,050 --> 02:55:03,510
Saw them saying that...

2594
02:55:03,510 --> 02:55:05,210
The actor was saying how like...

2595
02:55:05,210 --> 02:55:06,570
Don't blame it on the director.

2596
02:55:07,090 --> 02:55:08,050
Because like...

2597
02:55:08,050 --> 02:55:08,390
Um...

2598
02:55:08,950 --> 02:55:10,050
It wasn't his fault.

2599
02:55:10,730 --> 02:55:12,270
So I thought, like...

2600
02:55:12,270 --> 02:55:13,410
Maybe that's a lie.

2601
02:55:17,190 --> 02:55:19,330
Cause I saw him mentioning that.

2602
02:55:19,410 --> 02:55:20,130
Cause he was saying like...

2603
02:55:20,130 --> 02:55:21,110
Oh, don't blame it.

2604
02:55:21,610 --> 02:55:22,490
Don't blame it.

2605
02:55:22,630 --> 02:55:24,190
Look, I didn't even watch the first Joker.

2606
02:55:24,490 --> 02:55:26,410
And I'm definitely not gonna watch the second Joker.

2607
02:55:26,850 --> 02:55:27,730
Cause they were saying like...

2608
02:55:27,730 --> 02:55:28,830
Oh yeah, don't blame it on him.

2609
02:55:28,930 --> 02:55:29,390
Because like...

2610
02:55:31,330 --> 02:55:31,770
Um...

2611
02:55:33,790 --> 02:55:34,230
Uh...

2612
02:55:34,230 --> 02:55:34,570
Uh...

2613
02:55:34,570 --> 02:55:35,230
He...

2614
02:55:35,230 --> 02:55:36,150
It wasn't his fault.

2615
02:55:36,210 --> 02:55:37,670
The movie was really bad.

2616
02:55:37,830 --> 02:55:38,810
Oh, I know about bad!

2617
02:55:38,810 --> 02:55:40,830
They did zero test screening by the way.

2618
02:55:41,050 --> 02:55:42,190
I know about that too.

2619
02:55:43,010 --> 02:55:48,970
They did zero test screening for the second movie for some reason.

2620
02:55:49,370 --> 02:55:51,670
Now I know that's not misinformation.

2621
02:55:51,990 --> 02:55:53,650
Cause I read about that as well.

2622
02:55:54,310 --> 02:55:55,470
Which is crazy to say.

2623
02:55:55,610 --> 02:55:58,030
Because the Wally Coyote vs.

2624
02:55:58,230 --> 02:56:01,210
Acne movie had several test screenings.

2625
02:56:01,530 --> 02:56:03,950
And it tested really well.

2626
02:56:06,990 --> 02:56:08,090
So like...

2627
02:56:08,090 --> 02:56:09,910
And then they shelved that movie.

2628
02:56:11,030 --> 02:56:15,490
I think the CEO of Warner Brothers is just a really bad CEO.

2629
02:56:16,790 --> 02:56:22,190
Like he saves money for the company, but he has terrible movie decisions.

2630
02:56:31,210 --> 02:56:38,150
Yeah, the CEO is just really, really bad when it comes to decisions about movies.

2631
02:56:38,150 --> 02:56:40,370
But he's really good at saving money.

2632
02:56:41,350 --> 02:56:42,730
For some fucking reason.

2633
02:56:44,710 --> 02:56:45,350
XD

2634
02:56:49,350 --> 02:56:51,650
But, I think...

2635
02:56:52,450 --> 02:56:56,550
I think the CEO is just not really good with movie decisions.

2636
02:56:59,090 --> 02:57:03,990
I fucking hate him because he shelved the Wally Coyote movie.

2637
02:57:04,110 --> 02:57:05,910
Cause that movie actually looks really decent.

2638
02:57:07,370 --> 02:57:10,110
I really was looking forward to watching that too.

2639
02:57:14,220 --> 02:57:15,320
What was I going to say?

2640
02:57:16,580 --> 02:57:21,120
There was something I wanted to say about the Joker movie.

2641
02:57:21,300 --> 02:57:22,520
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah!

2642
02:57:22,720 --> 02:57:25,340
So there's going to be a TV show that's coming out.

2643
02:57:25,560 --> 02:57:33,440
That basically uses real life accounts from superhero productions.

2644
02:57:34,320 --> 02:57:37,440
There's this new British TV show that's coming out that's like a mockumentary.

2645
02:57:38,360 --> 02:57:41,200
And they're basically making fun of superhero movies.

2646
02:57:41,200 --> 02:57:48,200
And basically, one of the things that was actually apparently a true story.

2647
02:57:48,640 --> 02:57:52,820
Was that they don't reveal which superhero movies they got the sources from.

2648
02:57:53,480 --> 02:57:57,980
And one of the things they got that they made a parody over.

2649
02:57:59,980 --> 02:58:01,420
Was that...

2650
02:58:01,420 --> 02:58:02,400
I don't know...

2651
02:58:02,400 --> 02:58:04,440
Obviously we don't know if it's Marvel or DC.

2652
02:58:04,440 --> 02:58:09,260
But one of them, it's either Marvel or DC.

2653
02:58:09,640 --> 02:58:13,440
Made a director film fake scenes.

2654
02:58:14,100 --> 02:58:19,860
Because they didn't want to tell the director that they didn't like what he's doing.

2655
02:58:20,360 --> 02:58:23,780
So they made the director film fake scenes.

2656
02:58:24,100 --> 02:58:27,640
And then have the real scenes filmed at a different location.

2657
02:58:28,540 --> 02:58:29,880
And they didn't tell him.

2658
02:58:30,080 --> 02:58:31,420
So they just made him...

2659
02:58:33,040 --> 02:58:36,320
They just made him...

2660
02:58:36,320 --> 02:58:39,520
They just made him film that without...

2661
02:58:39,520 --> 02:58:42,040
And be like, sorry, we're not even going to use them.

2662
02:58:42,400 --> 02:58:44,520
But we just wanted you as a director.

2663
02:58:45,620 --> 02:58:46,800
And I'm like...

2664
02:58:46,800 --> 02:58:50,740
I'm like, that's absolutely crazy.

2665
02:58:51,820 --> 02:58:53,660
Like, what's the point?

2666
02:58:54,000 --> 02:58:54,300
What?

2667
02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:56,720
Why do that?

2668
02:59:01,370 --> 02:59:03,630
Like, if you don't like the scene...

2669
02:59:04,170 --> 02:59:05,770
Just tell him.

2670
02:59:09,090 --> 02:59:11,850
Like, at that point, he's not even directing anymore.

2671
02:59:12,630 --> 02:59:14,070
He's just the face.

2672
02:59:21,780 --> 02:59:24,680
This is like giving your fucking sibling the fake controller.

2673
02:59:27,900 --> 02:59:30,340
Like, also, that's such a huge waste of money.

2674
02:59:31,460 --> 02:59:32,300
Oh my god, we're almost there.

2675
02:59:32,400 --> 02:59:34,480
Oh my god, it's the 78%.

2676
02:59:35,120 --> 02:59:36,100
We're almost there, guys.

2677
02:59:36,100 --> 02:59:38,220
It's literally 1%, guys.

2678
02:59:38,380 --> 02:59:41,160
Oh my god, we're at the 1%.

2679
02:59:41,160 --> 02:59:43,500
Oh, we're at the final point!

2680
02:59:43,840 --> 02:59:44,700
This is it!

2681
02:59:45,020 --> 02:59:45,720
Oh, there's a roof.

2682
02:59:46,680 --> 02:59:47,900
I'm going to clean as much as I can.

2683
02:59:49,960 --> 02:59:52,220
Oh my god, it's literally the 1% right here.

2684
02:59:53,160 --> 02:59:56,340
I'm trying to clean as much as random shit I can everywhere.

2685
02:59:57,160 --> 03:00:02,140
Like, this random shit is going to add up to the 1% right here.

2686
03:00:02,860 --> 03:00:04,940
Look at the stuff I didn't clean.

2687
03:00:04,940 --> 03:00:06,400
But don't worry.

2688
03:00:07,840 --> 03:00:08,860
That's what...

2689
03:00:08,860 --> 03:00:09,520
Okay!

2690
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:11,260
Alright, here it is!

2691
03:00:11,920 --> 03:00:13,000
78%!

2692
03:00:15,900 --> 03:00:17,360
78%, guys.

2693
03:00:18,220 --> 03:00:19,020
70...

2694
03:00:19,020 --> 03:00:20,320
I swear to god.

2695
03:00:25,230 --> 03:00:26,630
At this together...

2696
03:00:27,130 --> 03:00:29,410
At this together, are we at 107...

2697
03:00:29,950 --> 03:00:30,610
At this...

2698
03:00:30,610 --> 03:00:31,790
At this together...

2699
03:00:32,190 --> 03:00:32,590
At...

2700
03:00:32,590 --> 03:00:33,870
At this together...

2701
03:00:33,870 --> 03:00:35,190
raine.gif

2702
03:00:42,770 --> 03:00:45,610
At this together...

2703
03:00:45,610 --> 03:00:50,110
Where is it?

2704
03:00:55,210 --> 03:00:58,350
Oh, it's 79 just to be safe?

2705
03:00:58,510 --> 03:00:58,670
Okay!

2706
03:01:00,470 --> 03:01:02,230
79 to be safe?

2707
03:01:02,230 --> 03:01:05,970
Okay, guys, it's 79 to be safe.

2708
03:01:06,090 --> 03:01:07,470
Oh, let's add that in.

2709
03:01:13,230 --> 03:01:14,350
All right.

2710
03:01:14,710 --> 03:01:17,830
Okay, 79 just to be safe.

2711
03:01:18,010 --> 03:01:19,250
Must be a glitch, right?

2712
03:01:19,750 --> 03:01:21,750
Must be a fucking glitch.

2713
03:01:22,330 --> 03:01:30,150
All right, if you say so.

2714
03:01:30,210 --> 03:01:32,210
Oh, it's just all just a silly glitch.

2715
03:01:32,230 --> 03:01:36,390
All right, let's oh, let's get that 79% in there.

2716
03:01:37,530 --> 03:01:39,010
Oh, what about 80?

2717
03:01:39,230 --> 03:01:39,890
Oh, okay.

2718
03:01:40,530 --> 03:01:41,530
Oh, all right.

2719
03:01:41,730 --> 03:01:43,390
Let's get that 80 in here.

2720
03:01:44,250 --> 03:01:45,350
Let's get that.

2721
03:01:45,910 --> 03:01:47,870
Oh, oh, you're right.

2722
03:01:47,990 --> 03:01:49,770
Maybe if I round it to 80.

2723
03:01:50,130 --> 03:01:53,290
Oh, maybe...

2724
03:01:54,510 --> 03:01:55,930
If I round it to 80.

2725
03:01:55,990 --> 03:01:56,370
Okay.

2726
03:01:56,470 --> 03:01:56,950
All right.

2727
03:01:57,170 --> 03:01:57,550
That's...

2728
03:01:57,550 --> 03:01:59,530
Okay, if that's what you say.

2729
03:02:00,190 --> 03:02:02,210
Oh, if that is what you say.

2730
03:02:04,530 --> 03:02:06,870
Oh, and we're almost to 80, guys.

2731
03:02:07,870 --> 03:02:10,070
We're almost to 80, guys.

2732
03:02:10,290 --> 03:02:12,810
We're almost there.

2733
03:02:17,250 --> 03:02:18,170
Check his mood.

2734
03:02:18,290 --> 03:02:19,510
Oh, check his bathroom.

2735
03:02:19,990 --> 03:02:21,630
Before you do anything in the swamp.

2736
03:02:21,850 --> 03:02:23,990
Okay, let's hope we get there first.

2737
03:02:26,070 --> 03:02:26,910
Like...

2738
03:02:26,910 --> 03:02:33,490
Guys, first off, we gotta make sure we fucking even get there, guys.

2739
03:02:37,330 --> 03:02:41,590
We gotta make sure we even live to tell the tale.

2740
03:02:44,470 --> 03:02:45,310
Okay.

2741
03:02:46,130 --> 03:02:50,130
What am I cleaning at this point?

2742
03:02:52,090 --> 03:02:53,870
Like, where is the window?

2743
03:02:54,050 --> 03:02:54,870
Oh, it's over here.

2744
03:02:55,270 --> 03:02:55,790
Okay.

2745
03:02:58,430 --> 03:02:59,770
I'll clean this.

2746
03:03:03,460 --> 03:03:07,740
Maybe the real swamp were the friends we made a long... don't give me that pussy-ass shit right now.

2747
03:03:08,000 --> 03:03:09,520
I've been here for three hours.

2748
03:03:13,820 --> 03:03:16,580
No, no friends were made right now.

2749
03:03:16,700 --> 03:03:19,320
In fact, we lost friends.

2750
03:03:19,320 --> 03:03:22,480
We lost friends.

2751
03:03:22,780 --> 03:03:25,800
One person is about to get fucking bad.

2752
03:03:26,040 --> 03:03:27,680
Lord Farquaad, I swear to god.

2753
03:03:28,020 --> 03:03:33,560
People are underestimating how difficult it is to be one of the most difficult.

2754
03:03:33,980 --> 03:03:34,820
All right.

2755
03:03:35,200 --> 03:03:36,700
This is it.

2756
03:03:37,260 --> 03:03:38,940
This is fucking it.

2757
03:03:39,640 --> 03:03:43,900
All right, we'll let Lord Farquaad say his truth real fast.

2758
03:03:47,000 --> 03:03:52,840
For example, every day I must deprive hard-working citizens the pleasure of life's pleasure.

2759
03:03:53,260 --> 03:03:54,780
Yeah, my fucking swamp.

2760
03:03:55,200 --> 03:03:55,800
That is a ruler.

2761
03:03:56,040 --> 03:04:01,560
The dull, uneventful existence is a burden that I alone must carry.

2762
03:04:04,240 --> 03:04:04,960
I swear.

2763
03:04:05,400 --> 03:04:07,240
I swear to fuck you.

2764
03:04:07,260 --> 03:04:08,340
Okay, here we go.

2765
03:04:08,960 --> 03:04:10,700
Here we fuck you go.

2766
03:04:12,620 --> 03:04:13,880
This is it.

2767
03:04:13,880 --> 03:04:17,880
We'll look at his face while we do this.

2768
03:04:39,860 --> 03:04:42,760
All I'm saying...

2769
03:04:50,660 --> 03:04:53,820
All right, I'll pray for you.

2770
03:04:55,160 --> 03:04:57,820
Man is indiscretion.

2771
03:04:57,940 --> 03:05:01,100
Thomas, thank you for the super chat.

2772
03:05:01,220 --> 03:05:01,940
Thank you.

2773
03:05:02,080 --> 03:05:02,960
Thank you.

2774
03:05:03,760 --> 03:05:05,020
Okay, Mia.

2775
03:05:06,840 --> 03:05:07,420
Don't.

2776
03:05:11,360 --> 03:05:16,920
Even if you run away now, just know I can find you.

2777
03:05:20,600 --> 03:05:21,960
So take this.

2778
03:05:25,480 --> 03:05:28,820
So reveal yourself right now.

2779
03:05:31,000 --> 03:05:37,200
For the sake of everybody, reveal yourself right now.

2780
03:05:38,260 --> 03:05:41,560
So at least you can die with some dignity.

2781
03:05:47,740 --> 03:05:52,280
So I heard it unlocks at 180 wings.

2782
03:05:52,380 --> 03:05:54,080
Thank you for the super chat.

2783
03:05:54,200 --> 03:05:54,720
Thank you.

2784
03:05:54,820 --> 03:05:55,140
Thank you.

2785
03:05:55,900 --> 03:05:57,700
Many thank you for the super chat.

2786
03:05:57,840 --> 03:05:58,060
Thank you.

2787
03:05:58,180 --> 03:06:02,340
Thank you for give the father for they not know what they did.

2788
03:06:03,720 --> 03:06:05,880
Okay, Mia, I'm gonna...

2789
03:06:13,060 --> 03:06:20,680
Okay, Mia, this is your one chance to at least take it with some form of dignity.

2790
03:06:25,160 --> 03:06:28,860
Oh, I need one level at a hundred percent.

2791
03:06:29,260 --> 03:06:30,980
Okay, who said that?

2792
03:06:31,440 --> 03:06:31,760
Okay.

2793
03:06:32,080 --> 03:06:33,090
All right.

2794
03:06:44,240 --> 03:06:45,060
Okay.

2795
03:06:45,060 --> 03:06:46,100
All right.

2796
03:06:46,260 --> 03:06:47,560
Are you... how?

2797
03:06:47,560 --> 03:06:48,180
How?

2798
03:06:54,900 --> 03:06:58,170
Are you really... are you... are you gonna join Alchemia?

2799
03:06:58,430 --> 03:06:58,890
Are you...

2800
03:06:58,890 --> 03:07:02,890
Are you here to join Alchemia with that statement?

2801
03:07:03,490 --> 03:07:07,170
This is your chance to back out.

2802
03:07:08,600 --> 03:07:15,010
I will... I'll give you the... I'll... I have, you know, I have like some...

2803
03:07:15,010 --> 03:07:15,230
Some...

2804
03:07:20,290 --> 03:07:24,370
I will... I will give you some form of pity.

2805
03:07:26,590 --> 03:07:30,270
Do you agree with that statement?

2806
03:07:31,910 --> 03:07:33,490
Do you... do you...

2807
03:07:33,490 --> 03:07:38,970
Do you want to say that statement again to me in my chat?

2808
03:07:39,210 --> 03:07:40,350
Oh, you're not even...

2809
03:07:41,030 --> 03:07:42,730
Eevee, I'm just gonna say.

2810
03:07:43,130 --> 03:07:43,950
Are you...

2811
03:07:43,950 --> 03:07:47,850
I have some... I... I still have mercy in me.

2812
03:07:48,890 --> 03:07:51,570
Do you... are you willing to...

2813
03:07:51,570 --> 03:07:53,450
Are you willing...

2814
03:07:53,450 --> 03:07:56,970
to say that again, Eevee?

2815
03:07:57,270 --> 03:07:59,890
Are you... are you a fucking coward?

2816
03:08:04,510 --> 03:08:09,210
I feel a little merciful right now.

2817
03:08:10,230 --> 03:08:15,110
Are you... are you willing to say that statement again, Eevee?

2818
03:08:21,610 --> 03:08:22,870
Say it again!

2819
03:08:23,110 --> 03:08:24,090
Say it again!

2820
03:08:24,710 --> 03:08:25,530
Come on!

2821
03:08:27,490 --> 03:08:29,830
Pick up the sword again.

2822
03:08:31,970 --> 03:08:33,130
Pick it up.

2823
03:08:33,690 --> 03:08:35,450
They ran away.

2824
03:08:36,970 --> 03:08:37,770
Well...

2825
03:08:37,770 --> 03:08:42,670
It looks like Eevee decided not to say it again.

2826
03:08:42,870 --> 03:08:44,850
Oh, I believe!

2827
03:08:45,970 --> 03:08:47,770
Oh, oh!

2828
03:08:49,820 --> 03:08:50,430
Oh!

2829
03:08:55,130 --> 03:09:00,170
All right, all right, all right.

2830
03:09:16,900 --> 03:09:17,680
Okay.

2831
03:09:19,480 --> 03:09:23,320
Wow, that... that is some fucking confidence right there.

2832
03:09:23,780 --> 03:09:25,460
All right, here we go.

2833
03:09:26,040 --> 03:09:30,440
That is some absolute confidence right there.

2834
03:09:34,080 --> 03:09:38,620
Okay, he fucking believes with his fucking heart right now.

2835
03:09:38,640 --> 03:09:40,640
He has...

2836
03:09:40,640 --> 03:09:44,680
Guys, I have... I have an hour and 30 minutes to see the swap.

2837
03:09:44,920 --> 03:09:46,240
That's all that matters.

2838
03:09:46,420 --> 03:09:48,080
I have an hour.

2839
03:09:49,280 --> 03:09:53,520
Akumia has been saved for like an extra 30 minutes.

2840
03:09:54,200 --> 03:09:59,200
They gets to live another extra 30 minutes because of Eevee.

2841
03:09:59,200 --> 03:09:59,880
Yeah!

2842
03:10:05,520 --> 03:10:08,960
Oh my god, what the fuck is this green- pink stuff?

2843
03:10:09,620 --> 03:10:12,020
Who else was part of this party?

2844
03:10:14,000 --> 03:10:15,920
Okay, we gotta...

2845
03:10:15,920 --> 03:10:17,920
We gotta change the extendo.

2846
03:10:21,010 --> 03:10:22,310
Oh my god.

2847
03:10:23,410 --> 03:10:27,050
This is how Toki's villain arc begins.

2848
03:10:31,590 --> 03:10:33,410
All right, let's clean them.

2849
03:10:33,650 --> 03:10:36,290
Let's clean whatever the fuck this is.

2850
03:10:40,750 --> 03:10:41,350
Wait.

2851
03:10:43,750 --> 03:10:44,030
Wait.

2852
03:10:44,770 --> 03:10:45,690
No, oh my god.

2853
03:10:45,730 --> 03:10:46,410
I got an achievement.

2854
03:10:46,570 --> 03:10:48,130
I thought I got baited.

2855
03:10:48,350 --> 03:10:50,490
I got an achievement and I thought...

2856
03:10:50,490 --> 03:10:52,130
I thought it was over.

2857
03:10:52,550 --> 03:10:55,650
I legitimately felt happiness for five seconds.

2858
03:10:56,150 --> 03:10:56,570
I...

2859
03:10:58,790 --> 03:11:04,250
I felt five seconds of pure happiness because I thought that was it.

2860
03:11:06,730 --> 03:11:12,490
Oh my god, how am I gonna... oh my god, please.

2861
03:11:14,070 --> 03:11:16,270
How is there still stains?

2862
03:11:17,370 --> 03:11:19,350
Okay, we got the... okay, we gotta get the door.

2863
03:11:21,390 --> 03:11:23,590
It has to be outside at this point.

2864
03:11:26,870 --> 03:11:27,330
Okay.

2865
03:11:28,590 --> 03:11:33,510
Oh my god, what else am I missing in this stupid carriage?

2866
03:11:34,070 --> 03:11:35,010
What am I supposed to...

2867
03:11:36,290 --> 03:11:36,750
Okay,

2868
03:11:42,590 --> 03:11:42,930
it's fine.

2869
03:11:43,150 --> 03:11:43,470
It's fine.

2870
03:11:43,510 --> 03:11:44,530
Everything is fine.

2871
03:11:45,210 --> 03:11:48,550
Everything, if a janitor can do this every day, so can I.

2872
03:11:49,450 --> 03:11:51,070
Okay, we got the interior.

2873
03:11:52,110 --> 03:11:53,190
We got the seating.

2874
03:11:55,050 --> 03:11:59,110
We got the... the... the fucking... oh my god, I can't even get out.

2875
03:11:59,350 --> 03:12:00,570
I can't even...

2876
03:12:00,570 --> 03:12:02,310
I can't even get out.

2877
03:12:02,450 --> 03:12:04,770
Okay, we got... grab the outside.

2878
03:12:08,030 --> 03:12:09,070
Okay, we got that.

2879
03:12:09,150 --> 03:12:10,770
Now we gotta get the onion skin.

2880
03:12:13,830 --> 03:12:17,710
Alright, how long of a banner are we gonna sign up for if we lie on the... forever.

2881
03:12:24,870 --> 03:12:28,330
Oh, you think... you think this is like a slap on the wrist?

2882
03:12:28,690 --> 03:12:30,670
I play power wash similar for three hours.

2883
03:12:31,010 --> 03:12:31,350
I play...

2884
03:12:33,270 --> 03:12:39,830
Oh, you think... you think lying on the internet is... oh, you think there's no consequences to lying on the internet?

2885
03:12:40,230 --> 03:12:41,010
You really...

2886
03:12:43,850 --> 03:12:47,810
You really think there's no consequences when it comes to lying on the...

2887
03:12:47,810 --> 03:12:48,050
I don't know.

2888
03:12:52,310 --> 03:12:52,970
Okay.

2889
03:12:55,130 --> 03:12:56,450
Alright, this...

2890
03:12:57,330 --> 03:12:58,190
You're gonna learn.

2891
03:12:58,450 --> 03:13:02,550
You're gonna learn your fu... your... your consequences when it comes to lying.

2892
03:13:05,470 --> 03:13:08,990
Better make a new account if you want to come back.

2893
03:13:14,270 --> 03:13:16,750
Alright, we got the carriage wheel.

2894
03:13:16,830 --> 03:13:17,710
We got this.

2895
03:13:22,470 --> 03:13:26,090
What the fuck am I missing from the onion carriage skin?

2896
03:13:29,330 --> 03:13:33,390
Assume like the doors is like... is the doors part of it?

2897
03:13:34,890 --> 03:13:36,070
No, it is.

2898
03:13:36,130 --> 03:13:37,130
Oh my god.

2899
03:13:37,930 --> 03:13:40,270
That gets IP bad.

2900
03:13:43,610 --> 03:13:46,250
Oh my god, that door is so dirty.

2901
03:13:48,550 --> 03:13:50,810
It's so fucking dirty.

2902
03:13:51,790 --> 03:13:53,210
Holy shit.

2903
03:13:53,510 --> 03:13:56,430
There has to be an easier way!

2904
03:14:05,250 --> 03:14:06,730
Can't believe it.

2905
03:14:07,610 --> 03:14:08,630
So much.

2906
03:14:08,710 --> 03:14:10,330
Oh my god, even the music stopped.

2907
03:14:10,450 --> 03:14:13,150
Even the music was like, please, please be done with this.

2908
03:14:13,450 --> 03:14:15,370
We've been here for so long, Doki.

2909
03:14:15,810 --> 03:14:16,670
Like, I...

2910
03:14:16,670 --> 03:14:17,130
Oh.

2911
03:14:22,260 --> 03:14:22,940
Alright.

2912
03:14:25,200 --> 03:14:30,800
Okay, we got the stupid-ass luggage roll.

2913
03:14:31,820 --> 03:14:37,660
Now we gotta get the flat bed and then the fucking... is the chest clean?

2914
03:14:37,860 --> 03:14:38,260
How?

2915
03:14:38,780 --> 03:14:39,180
Okay.

2916
03:14:40,540 --> 03:14:43,120
Is this the underside of the flat bed?

2917
03:14:46,240 --> 03:14:47,780
Oh my god, it is.

2918
03:14:50,970 --> 03:14:52,050
Where else is it?

2919
03:14:52,150 --> 03:14:53,910
Okay, the tiny little stains here.

2920
03:14:54,430 --> 03:14:56,490
Where else have I not cleaned it?

2921
03:14:58,410 --> 03:14:59,750
Oh, thank god.

2922
03:15:02,810 --> 03:15:03,450
Please.

2923
03:15:05,130 --> 03:15:06,170
Where else?

2924
03:15:06,450 --> 03:15:07,710
What am I missing?

2925
03:15:08,330 --> 03:15:11,710
What am I fucking missing on the onion skin?

2926
03:15:12,290 --> 03:15:13,310
Oh, there it is.

2927
03:15:13,330 --> 03:15:13,910
I did it.

2928
03:15:17,590 --> 03:15:18,510
Okay, there.

2929
03:15:18,770 --> 03:15:19,670
It's done.

2930
03:15:21,870 --> 03:15:23,590
And then the carriage wheel.

2931
03:15:24,170 --> 03:15:24,390
Alright.

2932
03:15:29,000 --> 03:15:31,000
There's still five more percent.

2933
03:15:32,500 --> 03:15:33,840
There's still five more percent.

2934
03:15:33,980 --> 03:15:34,500
I know.

2935
03:15:35,580 --> 03:15:36,900
Oh, you know what I know?

2936
03:15:37,080 --> 03:15:37,520
I know.

2937
03:15:38,100 --> 03:15:40,800
That Eevee guy will think, like, she's not gonna make it.

2938
03:15:41,320 --> 03:15:45,020
She's not gonna make it to 100% before her next collab.

2939
03:15:45,640 --> 03:15:47,960
But I'm so fucking locked in right now, Eevee.

2940
03:15:48,180 --> 03:15:52,320
I'll have you know, I am so fucking locked in right now.

2941
03:15:52,320 --> 03:15:55,920
I just- oh, you're gonna regret saying I believe.

2942
03:15:56,960 --> 03:15:58,440
You're gonna regret it.

2943
03:16:00,600 --> 03:16:04,260
I still have an hour and 20 minutes to make that 100%.

2944
03:16:04,920 --> 03:16:15,420
Oh, you think- you think you can- you think just because, like, the collab is in an hour and- Oh, you think because the collab is in an hour and 20 minutes that I will not complete this in time?

2945
03:16:16,100 --> 03:16:16,960
Oh, shoot.

2946
03:16:22,700 --> 03:16:25,020
You think that was gonna make you safe, Eevee?

2947
03:16:25,540 --> 03:16:30,380
Oh, at least Akimia has the dignity to fucking leave because she knows she was wrong.

2948
03:16:30,800 --> 03:16:41,840
At least Akimia knew before she embarrassed herself even more.

2949
03:16:42,240 --> 03:16:43,300
She fucking-

2950
03:16:51,140 --> 03:16:53,100
Honjord, thank you for the superchat.

2951
03:16:53,180 --> 03:16:53,500
Thank you.

2952
03:16:53,560 --> 03:16:54,000
Thank you.

2953
03:16:54,060 --> 03:16:58,780
I love how Doki was always powered by spite.

2954
03:17:02,380 --> 03:17:08,020
Oh my god, you grabbed every single part of this goddamn icing.

2955
03:17:09,920 --> 03:17:13,740
Me remembering Doki is supposed to have a chest bump, but the artist forgot to make one.

2956
03:17:13,840 --> 03:17:14,860
There's one consequence.

2957
03:17:14,960 --> 03:17:16,720
Thank god for life.

2958
03:17:27,750 --> 03:17:29,970
How how am I supposed to- HOW?

2959
03:17:30,250 --> 03:17:30,410
HOW?

2960
03:17:30,470 --> 03:17:32,790
MY LADDER'S NOT EVEN TALL ENOUGH!

2961
03:17:37,280 --> 03:17:44,820
Here we go It's just 1% Literally just that one.

2962
03:17:44,920 --> 03:17:45,140
Okay.

2963
03:17:45,560 --> 03:17:47,200
Oh another piece done.

2964
03:17:48,180 --> 03:17:50,440
Another piece is done.

2965
03:17:50,580 --> 03:17:52,360
Oh, it's getting closer.

2966
03:17:52,740 --> 03:17:57,100
It is getting awfully close now, Eevee!

2967
03:18:00,320 --> 03:18:02,860
It's getting so goddamn close.

2968
03:18:03,960 --> 03:18:05,680
Oh another piece is done.

2969
03:18:06,180 --> 03:18:07,800
Another piece is done.

2970
03:18:16,960 --> 03:18:18,660
Oh That is so close.

2971
03:18:18,800 --> 03:18:20,840
That frost icing right there.

2972
03:18:21,760 --> 03:18:23,880
That frost icing right there.

2973
03:18:26,060 --> 03:18:29,260
Okay, let's get that canopy, too.

2974
03:18:30,640 --> 03:18:34,500
I'm gonna make sure this is the cleanest fucking shit you've ever seen.

2975
03:18:34,900 --> 03:18:42,140
I'm gonna make sure.

2976
03:18:42,660 --> 03:18:44,240
I'm gonna make sure.

2977
03:18:52,790 --> 03:18:56,110
Okay, we need- we need the ladder.

2978
03:18:58,330 --> 03:19:00,150
We need the fucking ladder.

2979
03:19:03,050 --> 03:19:07,170
Oh my god, look at- look at this work of art that I'm doing.

2980
03:19:07,850 --> 03:19:10,830
96, you're 4% away.

2981
03:19:11,210 --> 03:19:13,370
You are 4% away.

2982
03:19:16,410 --> 03:19:20,330
I'm just saying, this is 4% closer.

2983
03:19:23,750 --> 03:19:25,150
Where's the window frame?

2984
03:19:25,270 --> 03:19:26,290
What do I need to clean up?

2985
03:19:27,150 --> 03:19:28,930
What do I need to clean left?

2986
03:19:32,010 --> 03:19:33,150
Oh, this part.

2987
03:19:36,650 --> 03:19:37,710
All right, what else?

2988
03:19:38,430 --> 03:19:40,310
All right, all the edges.

2989
03:19:41,830 --> 03:19:44,350
Every single one of these edges.

2990
03:19:44,410 --> 03:19:46,170
I am afraid.

2991
03:19:48,990 --> 03:19:51,410
Oh you- oh you better be.

2992
03:19:51,810 --> 03:19:55,350
You better- you know how those other streamers will have like unbanned requests?

2993
03:19:55,510 --> 03:19:57,290
We will never have an unbanned.

2994
03:20:03,370 --> 03:20:06,630
There is no such thing in Doki's world.

2995
03:20:13,520 --> 03:20:16,460
I will literally delete you out of existence.

2996
03:20:23,420 --> 03:20:27,170
All right, let's see.

2997
03:20:29,410 --> 03:20:34,830
Doki is unforgi- There's no forgiveness here.

2998
03:20:35,390 --> 03:20:37,970
You know what you did.

2999
03:20:42,480 --> 03:20:45,020
Okay, oh we're getting closer.

3000
03:20:45,900 --> 03:20:48,280
Oh, we're getting us so much closer.

3001
03:20:51,260 --> 03:20:54,380
He- he knew the risk.

3002
03:20:57,280 --> 03:20:58,980
Gotta make sure I got all of these.

3003
03:21:01,180 --> 03:21:03,960
What am I missing in the- oh there, the edge here.

3004
03:21:04,880 --> 03:21:06,280
Okay, the roof icing.

3005
03:21:09,400 --> 03:21:11,220
It's like the corners here.

3006
03:21:12,000 --> 03:21:13,560
Oh, that's a lot.

3007
03:21:14,980 --> 03:21:15,980
Okay, nice.

3008
03:21:17,120 --> 03:21:19,320
Yeah, we still have like- oh there it is.

3009
03:21:19,580 --> 03:21:22,040
I was like wondering what I'm missing from that icing area.

3010
03:21:22,160 --> 03:21:22,980
Oh my god.

3011
03:21:23,060 --> 03:21:24,820
There's so many- oh more.

3012
03:21:26,300 --> 03:21:32,480
93% I hope you got a priest to fucking- It's like death's row right now.

3013
03:21:32,660 --> 03:21:41,500
Like I hope you had your final meal and- And you- and you got the priest over to say your rites.

3014
03:21:42,140 --> 03:21:42,740
Everything.

3015
03:21:45,560 --> 03:21:54,040
Their final message before it- Okay, oh it has to be at the bottom here.

3016
03:21:59,810 --> 03:22:01,990
Oh, three more percent left.

3017
03:22:03,050 --> 03:22:05,170
Three more percent left.

3018
03:22:07,010 --> 03:22:08,990
Oh, it's on up to the top.

3019
03:22:09,070 --> 03:22:09,350
Okay.

3020
03:22:10,330 --> 03:22:11,510
Okay, it's the icing.

3021
03:22:11,850 --> 03:22:13,170
Oh, the side windows.

3022
03:22:13,590 --> 03:22:14,750
I don't know what to do here.

3023
03:22:19,190 --> 03:22:20,230
All right.

3024
03:22:21,830 --> 03:22:23,850
Is there anything else that's not seen?

3025
03:22:24,290 --> 03:22:28,790
The consumer music is not helping the vibe.

3026
03:22:38,410 --> 03:22:44,570
This is like- this is the theme of the- this is- this might as well be the theme of the stream.

3027
03:22:49,030 --> 03:22:54,170
Oh my god, the amount of fucking progress I have made here today.

3028
03:22:54,350 --> 03:22:56,910
I am not a coward, dude.

3029
03:22:58,150 --> 03:23:00,770
Thank you for the super chat, Warren.

3030
03:23:00,890 --> 03:23:01,310
Thank you.

3031
03:23:01,410 --> 03:23:02,170
Thank you.

3032
03:23:02,430 --> 03:23:03,210
Oh, so fun.

3033
03:23:03,330 --> 03:23:05,150
Welcome to the tomato farm.

3034
03:23:05,390 --> 03:23:05,790
Welcome.

3035
03:23:06,030 --> 03:23:06,410
Welcome.

3036
03:23:08,590 --> 03:23:10,210
How am I missing on the wall?

3037
03:23:11,890 --> 03:23:13,390
Might as well clean the gumdrop too.

3038
03:23:15,210 --> 03:23:21,070
I'm like missing something from this wall, but I feel like this wall is like so fucking clean right now.

3039
03:23:21,170 --> 03:23:22,030
Oh, there it is.

3040
03:23:26,430 --> 03:23:27,650
Okay, the stairs.

3041
03:23:28,030 --> 03:23:29,690
Okay, it has to be this part of the stairs.

3042
03:23:30,870 --> 03:23:31,250
Come on.

3043
03:23:31,610 --> 03:23:32,930
Oh, the underside.

3044
03:23:33,210 --> 03:23:34,210
It's always the underside.

3045
03:23:39,690 --> 03:23:41,710
Yeah, holy shit, the underside.

3046
03:23:41,710 --> 03:23:41,950
Oh my god.

3047
03:23:47,010 --> 03:23:48,630
We're at 2%.

3048
03:23:48,630 --> 03:23:52,470
I hope you talked to your priest and got your final meal.

3049
03:23:52,950 --> 03:23:54,310
It's at 2%.

3050
03:24:00,430 --> 03:24:01,650
This is it.

3051
03:24:01,950 --> 03:24:04,490
The final- the final frontier.

3052
03:24:12,030 --> 03:24:18,130
You thought- you thought I would not- you thought like, oh, Jokey has a collab in like, in an hour.

3053
03:24:18,410 --> 03:24:28,310
There's no way she would need like a little bit of time to- of intermission before she goes to- Oh, you think I'm- oh, you think I won't fucking delay a collab just to prove a point?

3054
03:24:28,650 --> 03:24:33,350
You think- You think I will stop even when the collab hits?

3055
03:24:33,630 --> 03:24:35,290
Oh, you think-

3056
03:24:39,390 --> 03:24:43,350
I would absolutely delay a collab if it means I gotta prove that I'm right.

3057
03:24:46,270 --> 03:24:46,670
Oh,

3058
03:24:52,590 --> 03:24:53,470
you thought you were safe?

3059
03:24:53,570 --> 03:24:54,230
You thought you were safe?

3060
03:24:54,370 --> 03:24:57,210
Then we'll fucking do this all the way to the goddamn end.

3061
03:25:00,870 --> 03:25:01,670
She's stunning.

3062
03:25:05,950 --> 03:25:07,910
Okay, it's the side wall.

3063
03:25:12,720 --> 03:25:15,280
This would be like, down here or something.

3064
03:25:18,860 --> 03:25:19,900
Oh, it's over here.

3065
03:25:19,960 --> 03:25:20,380
There we go.

3066
03:25:21,000 --> 03:25:22,240
I fucking knew it.

3067
03:25:25,440 --> 03:25:26,320
Side window?

3068
03:25:27,040 --> 03:25:29,360
Where the fuck is the dirty on the side window?

3069
03:25:29,520 --> 03:25:30,040
Oh, here.

3070
03:25:34,730 --> 03:25:35,690
Okay, there we go.

3071
03:25:39,260 --> 03:25:41,420
Okay, I just have to be on top of this now.

3072
03:25:42,240 --> 03:25:44,900
Wait, unless roof, icing, roof...

3073
03:25:46,420 --> 03:25:47,720
Okay, I need to make sure.

3074
03:25:50,480 --> 03:25:56,700
Yeah, I'm- I'm not- Can't fool me.

3075
03:25:56,720 --> 03:26:02,480
I know it's not- I know they're not gonna be like, um, actually, it's actually you need the tower- the castle.

3076
03:26:02,620 --> 03:26:04,340
No, you don't- you don't fool me.

3077
03:26:04,600 --> 03:26:07,220
You don't fucking fool me.

3078
03:26:09,580 --> 03:26:10,060
My

3079
03:26:14,590 --> 03:26:15,370
god, okay.

3080
03:26:18,290 --> 03:26:22,450
Okay, we got- What do we not do?

3081
03:26:22,550 --> 03:26:23,330
What do we not do?

3082
03:26:27,780 --> 03:26:28,880
What do we not do?

3083
03:26:34,690 --> 03:26:36,150
What do we not do from here?

3084
03:26:38,910 --> 03:26:39,710
The railing?

3085
03:26:39,910 --> 03:26:43,450
But where in the rail- oh, is it the underside of- oh my god.

3086
03:26:43,490 --> 03:26:44,470
Oh my god.

3087
03:26:44,550 --> 03:26:46,170
I didn't even realize there was more to this.

3088
03:26:47,290 --> 03:26:49,530
It was the underside of the railing.

3089
03:26:54,390 --> 03:26:54,760
Okay.

3090
03:26:59,450 --> 03:27:00,190
Okay.

3091
03:27:00,190 --> 03:27:00,450
Two more.

3092
03:27:00,590 --> 03:27:01,570
Okay, there we go.

3093
03:27:03,390 --> 03:27:04,850
Okay, that's done.

3094
03:27:05,010 --> 03:27:05,850
That part's done.

3095
03:27:05,990 --> 03:27:06,950
That part's done.

3096
03:27:07,990 --> 03:27:09,430
That part's done.

3097
03:27:10,930 --> 03:27:12,770
That is all done.

3098
03:27:12,910 --> 03:27:17,510
Okay, now it's time for the roof.

3099
03:27:17,510 --> 03:27:22,930
Oh, it's- Okay, we're at this point in our lives.

3100
03:27:23,770 --> 03:27:25,550
The 1% left.

3101
03:27:26,310 --> 03:27:28,210
The 1% left.

3102
03:27:28,690 --> 03:27:38,890
This guy's either gonna be fucking saved from execution or he's gonna- we're bringing back- We're bringing- or we're bringing it fucking back.

3103
03:27:39,170 --> 03:27:46,950
Or it's coming back right now.

3104
03:27:52,380 --> 03:27:54,040
There's a roof- where?

3105
03:27:55,600 --> 03:27:57,320
Oh, there's the dirty spot.

3106
03:27:57,440 --> 03:27:57,680
Okay.

3107
03:28:01,570 --> 03:28:05,370
Just trying to figure out what other part is dirty.

3108
03:28:07,150 --> 03:28:09,090
There's the other- oh nice.

3109
03:28:09,210 --> 03:28:10,930
Okay, and then the roof icing.

3110
03:28:12,250 --> 03:28:15,110
Chat reflects the stream.

3111
03:28:20,070 --> 03:28:21,830
Boyo, thank you for the super chat.

3112
03:28:21,890 --> 03:28:22,230
Thank you.

3113
03:28:22,290 --> 03:28:23,090
Thank you.

3114
03:28:27,500 --> 03:28:30,740
Alright, oh, that's a huge spot right here.

3115
03:28:34,740 --> 03:28:35,840
Where are the others on the ice?

3116
03:28:35,920 --> 03:28:36,220
Oh, there.

3117
03:28:36,560 --> 03:28:39,800
Okay, I was gonna say, like, I got everything.

3118
03:28:44,250 --> 03:28:44,650
Oh,

3119
03:28:47,670 --> 03:28:48,650
that is really dirty.

3120
03:28:51,710 --> 03:28:54,990
Oh my god, it's so- we almost got everything from this roof.

3121
03:28:55,090 --> 03:28:55,310
Nice.

3122
03:28:55,490 --> 03:28:57,410
Okay, what else?

3123
03:28:57,950 --> 03:28:59,410
Roof icing, chimney.

3124
03:28:59,630 --> 03:29:01,290
I think the chimney is the last part.

3125
03:29:02,850 --> 03:29:04,670
Oh wait, no, this part of the roof icing.

3126
03:29:04,830 --> 03:29:08,630
Oh my god, how much from the roof is fucked up?

3127
03:29:14,510 --> 03:29:16,490
There's, like, more on the roof?

3128
03:29:18,130 --> 03:29:19,570
Oh, it's right here.

3129
03:29:19,630 --> 03:29:20,510
Okay, I found it.

3130
03:29:20,530 --> 03:29:21,710
I was like, what the fuck?

3131
03:29:21,710 --> 03:29:22,690
What am I missing?

3132
03:29:25,710 --> 03:29:26,930
I was so confused.

3133
03:29:27,050 --> 03:29:28,490
I was like, what am I missing from the roof?

3134
03:29:29,410 --> 03:29:30,370
From the icing?

3135
03:29:32,830 --> 03:29:34,530
Okay, nice, this part is done.

3136
03:29:36,050 --> 03:29:37,290
Oh, this is it.

3137
03:29:37,410 --> 03:29:38,130
This is it.

3138
03:29:38,370 --> 03:29:39,150
This is it.

3139
03:29:39,450 --> 03:29:40,450
This is it.

3140
03:29:40,990 --> 03:29:41,770
This is it.

3141
03:29:42,650 --> 03:29:47,910
More people want to know if we're gonna witness a live execution of Eevee and-

3142
03:29:52,730 --> 03:29:54,570
This is the final frontier.

3143
03:29:59,310 --> 03:30:03,290
Okay, I need- I need the longer muzzle.

3144
03:30:09,350 --> 03:30:10,670
Oh, come on.

3145
03:30:11,270 --> 03:30:14,190
How the fuck am I supposed to get that donut?

3146
03:30:16,630 --> 03:30:19,030
Okay, guys, it's okay.

3147
03:30:19,030 --> 03:30:19,470
I'm calm.

3148
03:30:20,170 --> 03:30:21,130
She said calmly.

3149
03:30:24,290 --> 03:30:26,590
Like- Whoa!

3150
03:30:31,800 --> 03:30:34,520
Okay, we got this chimney.

3151
03:30:34,700 --> 03:30:36,200
Now, we gotta do the chimney donut.

3152
03:30:40,470 --> 03:30:42,570
Okay, one chimney donut.

3153
03:30:45,090 --> 03:30:47,530
Why is this donut still, like, dirty?

3154
03:30:51,590 --> 03:30:53,650
Okay, last chimney donut.

3155
03:30:54,330 --> 03:30:56,710
This might be the last chimney donut.

3156
03:30:58,150 --> 03:30:59,870
Wait, I can move this?

3157
03:31:00,890 --> 03:31:02,470
I can- Whoa!

3158
03:31:04,150 --> 03:31:04,770
Hahaha.

3159
03:31:07,570 --> 03:31:08,410
Okay.

3160
03:31:11,650 --> 03:31:14,850
Front door handle, onion, roof, icing.

3161
03:31:15,050 --> 03:31:15,470
Where?

3162
03:31:16,050 --> 03:31:16,750
Where?

3163
03:31:18,170 --> 03:31:19,490
Which roof?

3164
03:31:20,310 --> 03:31:21,770
Oh my god, it's this roof.

3165
03:31:27,410 --> 03:31:30,550
Okay, onion care step.

3166
03:31:31,370 --> 03:31:33,750
This is your final time.

3167
03:31:34,090 --> 03:31:36,050
Oh, front door handle.

3168
03:31:39,110 --> 03:31:41,530
Oh, oh that new job.

3169
03:31:46,530 --> 03:31:48,110
This is it.

3170
03:31:48,790 --> 03:31:50,370
This is- This is me.

3171
03:31:50,770 --> 03:31:51,550
This is me.

3172
03:31:51,730 --> 03:31:54,730
This is- We don't know yet.

3173
03:31:54,910 --> 03:31:57,050
We don't know yet.

3174
03:32:02,790 --> 03:32:03,430
Oh.

3175
03:32:10,630 --> 03:32:12,730
You live another day.

3176
03:32:14,110 --> 03:32:17,370
You live another day, Eevee.

3177
03:32:21,610 --> 03:32:29,610
The fact that Eevee stuck his neck out for- for another dragoon.

3178
03:32:29,770 --> 03:32:35,770
He actually stuck his head- neck out for the other dragoon.

3179
03:32:35,770 --> 03:32:40,030
For Alchemia, he was like, I got you.

3180
03:32:47,480 --> 03:32:51,930
So they can put the super chat naked naked.

3181
03:32:56,260 --> 03:33:04,350
He didn't even know this person and he was willing to do it all for them.

3182
03:33:04,350 --> 03:33:13,330
Their entire- He was willing to bet their- his entire account for this guy- for this random dragoon.

3183
03:33:14,510 --> 03:33:22,390
We were all- we were all gathered around the- the chair being like, getting the popcorn ready.

3184
03:33:29,010 --> 03:33:31,590
But he was saved.

3185
03:33:31,870 --> 03:33:33,850
The final- all right.

3186
03:33:34,350 --> 03:33:39,290
We gotta go to the- Open the door.

3187
03:33:41,030 --> 03:33:41,810
I did it.

3188
03:33:42,830 --> 03:33:46,910
What happens if I- What's the easter egg?

3189
03:33:48,830 --> 03:33:50,410
Is there an easter egg?

3190
03:33:52,930 --> 03:33:54,090
What's the easter egg?

3191
03:33:54,550 --> 03:33:55,510
He has lied to me!

3192
03:33:55,650 --> 03:33:58,810
You guys said- you guys said there was an easter egg!

3193
03:34:00,530 --> 03:34:01,050
Okay.

3194
03:34:01,050 --> 03:34:06,170
Some - Somebody once told me but- oh, I have to clean it?

3195
03:34:06,370 --> 03:34:07,230
Oh, I have to clean it.

3196
03:34:07,290 --> 03:34:07,550
Okay.

3197
03:34:07,970 --> 03:34:08,230
Okay.

3198
03:34:09,930 --> 03:34:10,990
Who said that?

3199
03:34:15,970 --> 03:34:17,350
Okay, okay.

3200
03:34:18,350 --> 03:34:18,870
Okay,

3201
03:34:24,330 --> 03:34:28,010
I need- Okay, all right.

3202
03:34:30,210 --> 03:34:32,970
All right, all right, here we go.

3203
03:34:33,010 --> 03:34:34,250
Here we go.

3204
03:34:35,850 --> 03:34:38,790
Somebody will take the chair today!

3205
03:34:39,450 --> 03:34:42,610
Somebody- we all gathered around the chair.

3206
03:34:45,290 --> 03:34:47,710
We- we all gathered around.

3207
03:34:48,090 --> 03:34:50,850
Somebody is going out today.

3208
03:34:50,850 --> 03:34:53,050
I told you that.

3209
03:34:53,350 --> 03:34:56,110
We all gathered around for a show.

3210
03:34:56,690 --> 03:34:58,790
Here we go again.

3211
03:35:01,770 --> 03:35:03,710
Okay, let's clean.

3212
03:35:04,230 --> 03:35:08,290
Let's clean this real quick for you guys.

3213
03:35:09,950 --> 03:35:11,790
All right, we got this part.

3214
03:35:12,750 --> 03:35:14,350
Oh, I'm a professional now.

3215
03:35:14,490 --> 03:35:16,670
I'm a fucking professional now.

3216
03:35:16,810 --> 03:35:17,930
That's all I'm saying.

3217
03:35:23,130 --> 03:35:26,030
I'm a fucking professional now on this.

3218
03:35:28,290 --> 03:35:31,970
I feel like this- doing this increases the motion sickness.

3219
03:35:32,410 --> 03:35:35,410
I don't get motion sickness, but I could feel like it could.

3220
03:35:37,330 --> 03:35:40,870
Oh, this is- people need to learn you can't just lie on the internet anymore.

3221
03:35:41,050 --> 03:35:48,170
People- Lying on the internet has consequences.

3222
03:35:51,520 --> 03:35:55,280
If this is how I must teach, then so be it.

3223
03:35:58,420 --> 03:35:59,970
The outhouse base.

3224
03:36:02,770 --> 03:36:08,330
All right, now you tell us this new doki rule.

3225
03:36:10,820 --> 03:36:15,130
All right, lying has consequences.

3226
03:36:16,410 --> 03:36:18,030
War has changed.

3227
03:36:22,220 --> 03:36:23,180
I miss when you lie.

3228
03:36:23,260 --> 03:36:23,900
I never lie.

3229
03:36:24,480 --> 03:36:25,680
What are you guys talking about?

3230
03:36:26,200 --> 03:36:28,400
I would never do that to you guys.

3231
03:36:30,680 --> 03:36:32,420
What am I missing from this wall?

3232
03:36:35,780 --> 03:36:38,480
What the fuck am I missing from this wall?

3233
03:36:38,660 --> 03:36:39,580
Everything is like...

3234
03:36:40,940 --> 03:36:41,460
gone.

3235
03:36:42,760 --> 03:36:44,860
The fuck is this one percent?

3236
03:36:45,900 --> 03:36:46,960
Okay, there it is.

3237
03:36:47,020 --> 03:36:47,860
That's what it was.

3238
03:36:48,900 --> 03:36:49,420
Okay.

3239
03:36:51,680 --> 03:36:54,060
Oh my god, I'll get this post too.

3240
03:36:55,480 --> 03:36:57,840
I wonder if I have to clean this as well.

3241
03:36:59,840 --> 03:37:01,780
Do I have to clean the pathway too?

3242
03:37:07,340 --> 03:37:08,560
Oh my god.

3243
03:37:09,660 --> 03:37:10,560
Guys, please.

3244
03:37:10,720 --> 03:37:11,960
I need the easter egg.

3245
03:37:12,780 --> 03:37:13,500
I'm desperate.

3246
03:37:14,100 --> 03:37:15,540
We made it this far.

3247
03:37:19,150 --> 03:37:20,550
Okay, we got the handle.

3248
03:37:21,150 --> 03:37:22,670
Wait, what are we missing from the door?

3249
03:37:23,170 --> 03:37:24,690
Oh, is it the other side?

3250
03:37:24,690 --> 03:37:26,730
I guess I have to do the other side of the door too.

3251
03:37:29,370 --> 03:37:29,850
Okay.

3252
03:37:30,310 --> 03:37:31,810
Oh yeah, I definitely had to.

3253
03:37:35,730 --> 03:37:36,850
Oh my god.

3254
03:37:40,070 --> 03:37:41,310
This is so close.

3255
03:37:41,450 --> 03:37:41,970
Come on.

3256
03:37:42,950 --> 03:37:44,090
Come on, please.

3257
03:37:45,250 --> 03:37:47,710
I want to know what the easter egg is.

3258
03:37:50,170 --> 03:37:53,890
How did it go to inside the bathroom?

3259
03:37:54,930 --> 03:37:57,890
To like... how did it get in the house?

3260
03:37:57,910 --> 03:37:59,210
That's what I want to know.

3261
03:38:00,590 --> 03:38:01,330
Let's see.

3262
03:38:04,150 --> 03:38:07,710
Wait, I need to... oh, there you go.

3263
03:38:07,890 --> 03:38:08,970
I need to get this.

3264
03:38:11,590 --> 03:38:14,410
So I can actually...

3265
03:38:15,490 --> 03:38:16,610
clean this part.

3266
03:38:18,430 --> 03:38:20,810
Guys, I'm fucking professional now.

3267
03:38:22,610 --> 03:38:24,930
I'm a goddamn professional.

3268
03:38:25,770 --> 03:38:29,450
Oh, I'm such a good cleaner.

3269
03:38:31,170 --> 03:38:36,070
From sheer spite, I've managed to improve as a fucking janitor.

3270
03:38:38,650 --> 03:38:40,550
From sheer spite.

3271
03:38:43,730 --> 03:38:48,470
Remember when I first started cleaning at Lord Farquaad's casa?

3272
03:38:49,170 --> 03:38:50,510
Look at me now.

3273
03:38:50,630 --> 03:38:52,110
This is her now.

3274
03:38:55,610 --> 03:38:57,430
Jesus Christ.

3275
03:38:58,050 --> 03:38:59,530
In the toilet too?

3276
03:39:00,370 --> 03:39:00,770
Bro.

3277
03:39:04,330 --> 03:39:09,750
If she quits streaming, she could literally become a janitor.

3278
03:39:12,470 --> 03:39:14,750
Okay, we're almost done with this part.

3279
03:39:19,640 --> 03:39:21,860
Okay, is there... can I close this?

3280
03:39:21,960 --> 03:39:22,180
No.

3281
03:39:23,140 --> 03:39:25,960
It's like the toilet says it needs to be cleaned more, but like...

3282
03:39:27,800 --> 03:39:31,700
I don't see any more stains on the... oh, I shouldn't use the word stains.

3283
03:39:33,800 --> 03:39:34,240
Okay.

3284
03:39:38,610 --> 03:39:40,510
All right, we got that side of the wall.

3285
03:39:41,970 --> 03:39:42,610
Uh...

3286
03:39:44,050 --> 03:39:45,310
Like... where am I?

3287
03:39:45,410 --> 03:39:45,790
Oh, there.

3288
03:39:45,910 --> 03:39:46,110
Okay.

3289
03:39:46,650 --> 03:39:47,470
And the side.

3290
03:39:49,010 --> 03:39:49,950
Almost there.

3291
03:39:51,210 --> 03:39:52,610
Literally one more wall.

3292
03:39:53,310 --> 03:39:54,630
And then the roof.

3293
03:39:59,300 --> 03:40:02,720
Like, it says the toilet has like one more... where?

3294
03:40:04,240 --> 03:40:04,880
Here?

3295
03:40:06,080 --> 03:40:07,280
Okay, there we go.

3296
03:40:07,920 --> 03:40:09,220
And now it's time.

3297
03:40:09,380 --> 03:40:11,580
Where's the... where's the equipment?

3298
03:40:13,820 --> 03:40:14,620
It's time.

3299
03:40:16,960 --> 03:40:18,000
We're so close.

3300
03:40:19,320 --> 03:40:21,400
How do I... how?

3301
03:40:22,580 --> 03:40:24,100
My staircase doesn't work.

3302
03:40:24,720 --> 03:40:25,120
How?

3303
03:40:26,040 --> 03:40:26,420
Get

3304
03:40:31,910 --> 03:40:32,230
up!

3305
03:40:32,490 --> 03:40:33,290
Oh, is it the ladder?

3306
03:40:33,470 --> 03:40:34,050
Oh my god.

3307
03:40:34,130 --> 03:40:35,050
It's the ladder, isn't it?

3308
03:40:35,090 --> 03:40:35,630
Oh my god.

3309
03:40:35,650 --> 03:40:36,630
It was the fucking ladder.

3310
03:40:36,750 --> 03:40:37,470
Oh my god.

3311
03:40:37,510 --> 03:40:37,710
Okay.

3312
03:40:39,030 --> 03:40:40,470
Oh Jesus, this isn't even glitter.

3313
03:40:40,630 --> 03:40:41,810
It's just fucking algae.

3314
03:40:47,640 --> 03:40:49,180
Oh my god, this is it.

3315
03:40:49,680 --> 03:40:51,060
This is... we made it.

3316
03:40:51,840 --> 03:40:52,780
We're gonna make it.

3317
03:40:53,500 --> 03:40:54,720
We're gonna make it.

3318
03:40:54,760 --> 03:40:55,400
It's time!

3319
03:40:56,620 --> 03:40:57,700
It's time!

3320
03:41:12,720 --> 03:41:13,280
Somebody!

3321
03:41:34,680 --> 03:41:37,320
All right, I'm gonna get the chair.

3322
03:41:38,360 --> 03:41:38,920
Oh,

3323
03:41:50,100 --> 03:41:51,020
above the door?

3324
03:41:51,100 --> 03:41:52,960
Oh, oh, did I miss a spot?

3325
03:41:53,260 --> 03:41:54,500
Oh, yeah, where?

3326
03:41:54,980 --> 03:41:57,200
Where have I possibly missed?

3327
03:41:58,200 --> 03:41:58,960
I'm getting the chair.

3328
03:41:59,140 --> 03:41:59,720
I'm getting it.

3329
03:41:59,720 --> 03:42:00,520
I'm getting it.

3330
03:42:00,900 --> 03:42:01,600
I'm getting it.

3331
03:42:01,880 --> 03:42:03,200
I'm getting the fucking chair.

3332
03:42:03,300 --> 03:42:03,540
Where?

3333
03:42:03,980 --> 03:42:06,260
How could I... oh, you mean the path?

3334
03:42:06,420 --> 03:42:07,920
Oh, you want me to clean the path?

3335
03:42:08,080 --> 03:42:08,540
Oh, okay.

3336
03:42:08,600 --> 03:42:11,140
Let me... let me clean the fucking path.

3337
03:42:16,570 --> 03:42:18,910
Oh, there was a post unclean?

3338
03:42:21,930 --> 03:42:22,730
What?

3339
03:42:22,730 --> 03:42:22,730
Where?

3340
03:42:23,530 --> 03:42:24,170
Where is it?

3341
03:42:25,350 --> 03:42:27,970
Oh, you are... oh, you're so lucky.

3342
03:42:28,390 --> 03:42:30,670
You're... oh, you are so lucky.

3343
03:42:31,110 --> 03:42:32,630
You are... you... oh.

3344
03:42:32,630 --> 03:42:34,510
Oh... oh...

3345
03:42:45,010 --> 03:42:48,790
All right, the moment of truth.

3346
03:42:50,250 --> 03:42:52,590
The back of it... nope.

3347
03:42:52,750 --> 03:42:53,330
No, you can't.

3348
03:42:53,390 --> 03:42:53,530
Nope.

3349
03:42:53,610 --> 03:42:54,550
There's nothing here.

3350
03:42:57,950 --> 03:43:01,890
Everything has been incredibly clean.

3351
03:43:02,730 --> 03:43:03,990
There's nothing else.

3352
03:43:04,170 --> 03:43:05,210
There's no more excuses.

3353
03:43:05,650 --> 03:43:07,430
There's no more excuses.

3354
03:43:09,130 --> 03:43:10,750
Look out the window of what?

3355
03:43:13,390 --> 03:43:13,990
What?

3356
03:43:14,070 --> 03:43:14,890
There's nothing here.

3357
03:43:21,380 --> 03:43:22,560
There's nothing here.

3358
03:43:22,880 --> 03:43:23,900
What do you mean look out the window?

3359
03:43:34,850 --> 03:43:36,150
There's nothing else.

3360
03:43:46,490 --> 03:43:47,550
Fuck with me.

3361
03:43:47,730 --> 03:43:49,070
Don't you fuck with me.

3362
03:43:52,010 --> 03:43:53,850

Don't you fuck with me right now.

3365
03:44:02,610 --> 03:44:04,410
Don't you fuck with me.

3366
03:44:10,250 --> 03:44:17,350
I needed to clean the outhouse door and handle needs it to be cleaned first.

3367
03:44:17,350 --> 03:44:18,430
We're in it.

3368
03:44:18,790 --> 03:44:19,770
That's the secret.

3369
03:44:20,070 --> 03:44:21,830
That was the secret all along.

3370
03:44:22,210 --> 03:44:25,010
That you just wanted me to get an achievement.

3371
03:44:25,390 --> 03:44:27,410
That's that was it.

3372
03:44:27,670 --> 03:44:37,670
That was it.

3373
03:44:37,850 --> 03:44:39,550
You just wanted me to...

3374
03:44:46,840 --> 03:44:49,280
It's not even an easter egg.

3375
03:44:49,440 --> 03:44:51,000
How is that an easter?

3376
03:44:51,020 --> 03:44:53,140

I need you to type right now.

3411
03:48:40,150 --> 03:48:43,050
Been an honor, dragoons.

3412
03:48:46,270 --> 03:48:48,530
And there he goes.

3413
03:48:50,430 --> 03:48:52,210
There he goes.

3414
03:48:56,750 --> 03:48:58,750
And he's gone.

3415
03:49:00,570 --> 03:49:03,170
And he's gone.

3416
03:49:13,310 --> 03:49:16,050
Now we learned that you cannot lie on the internet.

3417
03:49:16,050 --> 03:49:16,710
Now...

3418
03:49:21,280 --> 03:49:27,540
What we learned today is that you cannot lie on the internet no more.

3419
03:49:27,720 --> 03:49:29,160
You cannot lie.

3420
03:49:34,180 --> 03:49:36,780
Macarena, thank you for the five gifted ships.

3421
03:49:37,260 --> 03:49:38,540
Thank you, thank you.

3422
03:49:42,390 --> 03:49:44,130
You know what's even worse?

3423
03:49:44,130 --> 03:49:46,590
He was shadowbanned.

3424
03:49:47,010 --> 03:49:51,510
He can type all he wants, but nobody will see him.

3425
03:49:59,810 --> 03:50:02,090
That's so cruel!

3426
03:50:04,570 --> 03:50:09,650
He can think he's involved, but no one will ever see what he says.

3427
03:50:10,150 --> 03:50:13,310
No one will see his words.

3428
03:50:18,650 --> 03:50:23,170
He can scream, but he has no presence no more.

3429
03:50:23,590 --> 03:50:26,810
A fate worse than banning.

3430
03:50:30,030 --> 03:50:32,930
Thou shalt not lie on the internet.

3431
03:50:33,410 --> 03:50:34,930
Cruz, thank you for the super chat.

3432
03:50:35,030 --> 03:50:36,170
Thank you, thank you.

3433
03:50:37,290 --> 03:50:42,590
I'd just like to point out, you collabed with Chill yesterday, and he has been lying on the internet for over 15 years.

3434
03:50:42,670 --> 03:50:44,010
Thank you for the super chat.

3435
03:50:44,950 --> 03:50:48,670
Yes, but it starts today.

3436
03:50:49,030 --> 03:50:50,270
It starts today.

3437
03:50:52,250 --> 03:50:53,590
Warren, thank you for the super chat.

3438
03:50:53,670 --> 03:50:54,570
Thank you, thank you.

3439
03:50:54,830 --> 03:50:59,070
How much for his- you cannot bail someone that's fucking gone!

3440
03:50:59,070 --> 03:51:03,090
You cannot- he's literally executed live.

3441
03:51:03,430 --> 03:51:06,910
You can't bail someone that's just gone, chat.

3442
03:51:07,290 --> 03:51:09,470
Like, he doesn't exist no more.

3443
03:51:09,890 --> 03:51:14,010
He doesn't even exist.

3444
03:51:15,810 --> 03:51:17,450
Thank you for the super chat.

3445
03:51:17,590 --> 03:51:18,610
Thank you, thank you.

3446
03:51:18,990 --> 03:51:23,130
Alright guys, what a great way to call- end the stream.

3447
03:51:23,130 --> 03:51:26,350
Anyway guys, I hope you guys had a great time.

3448
03:51:26,890 --> 03:51:31,250
I'm gonna- I have 40 minutes to rest up before the collab.

3449
03:51:33,030 --> 03:51:36,350
Cruz, if you're still here, please give us a sign.

3450
03:51:36,810 --> 03:51:38,110
Rosen, thank you for the super chat.

3451
03:51:38,190 --> 03:51:39,190
Thank you, thank you.

3452
03:51:39,510 --> 03:51:42,530
Alright guys, I'm gonna head off and rest before my next collab.

3453
03:51:42,830 --> 03:51:45,030
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

3454
03:51:45,210 --> 03:51:45,750
Posture check.

3455
03:51:45,830 --> 03:51:47,930
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3456
03:51:47,930 --> 03:51:52,570
And if you stayed up for me, head to bed cuz you deserve it.

3457
03:51:52,730 --> 03:51:54,890
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

3458
03:51:55,430 --> 03:51:56,850
Bye guys.

3459
03:51:57,730 --> 03:51:58,410
Bye!
