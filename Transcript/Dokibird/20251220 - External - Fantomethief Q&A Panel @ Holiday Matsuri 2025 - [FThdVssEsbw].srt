1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,540
I actually hear me during my class.

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,540
We're like, yeah, so like I should say stuff like this.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,100
It's the real deal, it's just the real deal.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,260
And then I was like, it wasn't a test, it was real.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:14,920
It was real.

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,720
Wait, now you have to say that for real though.

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,560
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,240
Yeah.

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,540
Woo, everybody's a surprise!

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:25,500
Woo!

11
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,600
And then later I was like, okay, are we getting viewed?

12
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,280
I'm sweating for the queue!

13
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,520
I don't know.

14
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,440
Can you guys see us?

15
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,140
No!

16
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,920
This is real now.

17
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,760
This is real.

18
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,400
No more tests.

19
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,580
It's happening.

20
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,580
Hello, how are you with Sherry?

21
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,260
Welcome.

22
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,620
Welcome to the Phantom Thief Paddle, everyone.

23
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:04,540
Yay!

24
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,840
Isn't that what the panel is called?

25
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,800
What is this called?

26
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,780
It is called fantasy.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,060
What the fuck do you mean?

28
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,800
Doki, there's babies here!

29
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,030
Oh, sorry, what the heck do you mean?

30
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,920
I forgot there's people walking behind.

31
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,340
Yeah, I literally saw people walking behind you guys.

32
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:33,260
Should we, maybe just in case there's somebody that's like,
who are these obnoxious anime women?

33
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,460
I don't know, I know who just swore in front of children.

34
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,020
I am a bad influence.

35
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,880
Her parents did not let their kids watch me.

36
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,680
Obviously Doki's streams are 18 plus.

37
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,980
Yeah, yeah, my streams are 18 plus.

38
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,540
Exactly the reasons you think.

39
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,820
Men's channel is for children, for kids.

40
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,880
Yeah, we're Muppets.

41
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,300
You guys are like Coco Melon.

42
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,120
Coco Melon.

43
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,480

44
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,080
Yeah, woo, Coco Melon.

45
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,360
What does a Coco Melon do?

Brain and then who are you?

49
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:53,690
I couldn't even hear what your intro was.

50
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:56,970
Good, don't listen to me.

51
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:00,610
Oh, I mean I rarely do, but...

52
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,070
You barely listen to anything.

53
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,750
Yeah, I don't even listen to myself.

54
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,250
It goes from one ear to the other.

55
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,190
I just go with it.

56
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:08,810
They're great.

57
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:09,490
For real.

58
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,390
Yeah, yeah, it's just all vibes.

59
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:12,130
All vibes.

60
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,590
We have pure instinct and vibes.

61
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,230
Yeah.

62
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:23,730
doing a Q&A for you guys so if you guys have any questions
or you might not have we might not have the answers to them

63
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:33,410
but you know it'll be fun to just hang out and talk to all
the dragoons and the boo-boo no it's not saying no the crowd

64
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:42,750
goes miles stop making it because they don't want to be
called that they're like please don't let her name us no I

65
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:52,550
veto I veto it you veto it Yeah, but you only get one veto
You can't veto the other That's how vetoes work Why would

66
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,170
you have votes?

67
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,470
Why can't I have unlimited veto?

68
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:02,210
Because then it's not a democratic vote That's just your
vote Danny, are you there?

69
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:13,170
Hi, I'm here I was waiting for your cue But I guess I missed
it It's okay, we didn't get a cue either Amazing You're just

70
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:18,050
here Hi guys, I'm Danny, also known as Danny Sores.

71
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:24,790
I'm one of the cosplay guests with K2B, and I'm super
excited to be here and host the Phantom Thief panel.

72
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:38,950
So anyways, if you have a question, we will have a line down
this center column here, and we will have these two lovely

00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,650
gentlemen here to review your questions.

74
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,390
Please, be respectful.

75
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,050
You know, you know the drill.

76
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,430
They look like- No, they look like bodyguards.

77
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:49,970
They look like bouncers, you know?

78
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,690
Jojo pose, Jojo pose.

79
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:56,490
I was like, they're bouncers, bodyguards, and babysitters
all at once, so.

80
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:57,750
Wait, who's the baby?

81
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:58,310
Is it me?

82
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,790
I'm the baby, I'm the baby.

83
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,250
I'm the baby.

84
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,490
Lovely, lovely.

85
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:11,270
So if you have a question, please feel free to come line up,
ask your Oshis what you want, just know they're judging you,

86
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,430
so don't be too weird.

87
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:18,510
That's one of the types of clubs, if they're bouncers, it's
types of clubs where we judge your outfit too, if you're

88
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:19,850
It's good enough to get in.

89
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,070
We'll get ratings out of 10.

90
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,870
Chats to get in the front of the line.

91
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:34,810
And anyways, Mint Doki, are you ready for your first
question?

92
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:36,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go.

93
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:37,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

94
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:39,170
Hi, Mint.

95
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:39,830
Hi, Doki.

96
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:40,890
Hey.

97
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,930
This is a question for Mint specifically.

98
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:44,610
Okay.

99
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:45,730
Oh, sorry.

100
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:46,210
I'm sorry.

101
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,510
When...

102
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:52,690
You mentioned that you met Vinny at a MGS pop-up store.

103
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:53,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

104
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,670
And Vinny is like one of my favorite Fleshcubers.

105
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:00,950
So I was wondering if you would be open to collabing with
him one of these days.

106
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,330
I think so.

107
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,890
Because Nymo knows him.

108
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,190
So I feel, well, I guess I met him.

109
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:09,230
I don't know.

110
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,110
I would.

111
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,730
I don't know what we do.

112
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,690
Want to just talk?

113
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,050

Thank you so much for your question.

00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,670
Now we'll have our next question.

119
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:54,410
Hello, both of you.

120
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:54,870
Hi!

121
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,810
Here's a quick question for Mint.

122
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,330
Oh, what's your favorite Metal Gear game?

123
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,830
Well, Doki, yours would be Delta, right?

124
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,290
I mean, that's the only game I play.

125
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:11,410
I mean, I did play the, was it Metal Gear Rising?

126
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,130
Oh, Rising, yeah.

127
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:12,950
Yeah, yeah.

128
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,210
I still, I don't know.

129
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:18,250
I like the, I haven't figured out which one's better yet.

130
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:22,790
Because I have, I felt like I was mostly watching a movie
for the- That's so true.

131
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,010
I like Metal Gear Solid 2.

132
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,010
Why?

133
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:29,670
Why too?

134
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,030
It was the reason.

135
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,930
Well, if you played the game, you would understand.

136
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,130
Like, oh, don't you burn.

137
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:41,750
Like, you're just gonna say 2 and not explain, like, what
Kojima did that made 2 the best one.

138
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,690
Okay, who, raise your hand if you play 2.

139
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,330
Okay, you understand, right?

140
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,110
nod your head.

141
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:52,250
I saw people who didn't raise their hands, but they don't
understand.

142
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,930
You gotta give context to why you pick two.

143
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:55,850
Raise your hand.

144
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:56,590
Who loves spoilers?

145
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:00,310
Raise your hand if you watch someone play two.

146
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:04,730
So there's still some hands that didn't raise up.

147
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:05,890
There's still some hands.

148
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,350
How do I explain two?

149
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:12,250
The Patriots.

150
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,370
That's that's all.

151
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:23,950
amazing thank you so much we actually wanted you to have an
entire powerpoint presentation of why metal gear solid 2 was

152

So I have a question.

157
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:49,850
Yeah.

158
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:53,490
So I know both of you guys, you guys like to laugh a lot.

159
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:54,790

00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:59,190
So what is the best knockout moments that you guys have?

161
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:00,930
Oh my god.

162
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:01,670
So many.

163
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,430
I can't even...

164
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,790
Wait, I have one from recently.

165
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:08,430
I have one from literally like the other night when you were
playing and...

166
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,350
Oh, is it a crocodile?

167
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:13,710
It was when you were like swimming and I was like, I think
you're gonna drown.

168
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,230
And you were like, I'm gonna drown.

169
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,350
Yeah, that one was good.

170
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:22,970
Also, that one was my favorite.

171
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:28,430
When we were playing the, we did the Sloppy Sisters Club and
we played the fireworks game and we launched the nuke.

172
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:32,410
Oh, hey, I was like, hey guys, I think I found a nuke.

173
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,690

No, I think the nuke one was my favorite, too.

176
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,310
I was like, I wonder what happens when we die.

00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,270
Yeah, Doki the bird.

182
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:23,670
Do you have a favorite?

183
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:26,310
He's thinking.

184
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,570
Oh, while he's thinking, I can share my favorite.

185
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,670
You guys want to hear that?

186
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:31,050
Yeah!

187
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:36,830
So about one year ago, I attended a Phantom Thief concert in
Atlanta.

188
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,090
Amazing.

189
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:40,370
You guys...

190
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,170
A year ago, like most recently.

191
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:42,710
Yeah.

192
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:43,530
Yeah.

193
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,730
Your performance was so good.

194
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:50,590
I freaked out, I was so excited, and that was the moment I
decided I was cosplaying both of you to Off-Kai.

195
00:10:52,790 --> 00:11:01,210
What the one moment that made me laugh so hard is that Doki
was playing Marvel Rivals at the start of the concert and It

196
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:07,230
was just so on-brand and your banter was hilarious, and I'll
forever remember that memory in my heart, so What do you

197
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:07,490
remember?

198
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:08,470
Concert canceled.

199
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,630
Time for Marvel Rivals.

200
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,310
It's time to play Marvel Rivals, everyone.

201
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,310
Cossack canceled.

202
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:17,450
I've got a play rake.

203
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,150
And, you know, he can't think of a moment.

204
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,310
There's just too many.

205
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,930
You're still full of fun and laughter.

206
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,250
So we'll actually just head on to our next question.

207
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:27,410
Okay, thank you.

208
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:29,730
Hi.

209
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,210
Hi, Minton.

210
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:33,870
Hi.

211
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:40,190
Mint, remember how you got the Metal Gear Solid 4 pachinko
machine and how we all knew about it?

212
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:40,590
Oh, sorry.

213
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,550
Metal Gear Solid 3, pachinko machine.

214
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:43,070
By bad.

215
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:44,130
Actually.

216
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,610
I don't know.

217
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:46,750
Never played the games.

218
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:47,750
Never watched the games.

219
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,850
of Metal Gear Iron Zone.

220
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:52,210
Never once did you just do about your fun fact, man.

221
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:53,250
Just...

222
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,090
You're so honest, I appreciate that.

223
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:03,630
But the thing is, since you got Joke Bird into Metal Gear
Solid Delta, when you get to have her have a go at the Metal

224
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,750
Gear Solid and just be...

225
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,450
Oh, you want to go over?

226
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,270
Oh, yeah, let's do it.

227
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,090
Wait, do you still have it?

228
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:09,810
Yeah, I haven't.

229
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,130
Oh, shit, yeah, I'll be able to try it.

230
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:12,310
Okay.

231
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:13,410
You have to use real money?

232
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,310
No, no.

233
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,330
I mean, are you...

234
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,030
Yes, actually.

235
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,810
Yeah, like I come over like we're just gambling at Mintz
House.

236
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,710
I withdraw the money and then I keep it.

237
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:24,810
That's how it works.

238
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,470
You speak to the stream, please.

239
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:28,430
Thank you.

240
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,150
We get a stream?

241
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,430
Oh, we could probably.

242
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,110
We could probably do that.

243
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:35,310
Who else would love to see that as a stream?

244
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

245
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,770
What if I just get like bird wings?

246
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,130
Just like gallons of bird wings.

247
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,070
And on to our next question.

248
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:56,350
I love that we have one urm actually moment of this panel
already so and here we go hi hey Doki hey boss so I have

249
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:02,430
come here with a very important question to ask you and
that's can God heat up a burrito so hot that he himself

250
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:12,430
could not touch it have you ever he heated up a burrito no I
haven't heated a burrito there's no like Mexican restaurants

251
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:23,790
in Canada okay but like but like it's but like it's very
rare to find a good one it's like I I know what God has

252
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:33,610
feared I know I have heated up the burrito and it is pulled
on the outside and then it becomes so hot inside that you're

253
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:46,610
like I I don't I there's this is unlevel levels of high that
I feel like it is literally the center of the earth covering

254
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:49,370
it so that the heat is evenly distributed.

255
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:50,830
No.

256
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:51,770
Right.

257
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:56,830
It's like, um, I don't feel like that doing that.

258
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,790
That's a bit too much work.

259
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:04,250
Getting a cover to put on top of your burrito, too much
work.

260
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,410
Just stick it in the microwave.

261
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:05,950
I got this.

262
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:06,810

00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:18,110
going into the still water making sure there's like
brain-eating amoebas in there like it's like the tombstone

00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:28,850
that was oh but like they can't really eat anything there's
nothing inside that was a lovely roast I appreciate it oh

And then my second favorite is when I went over to Ocelot
and I shot him and then you're like, you created a time.

316
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,310
I was like, why can't I kill him?

00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:25,990
I don't even know.

318
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:29,130
Was there even part of the story you did that?

319
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,110
I was trying to change the course of history.

320
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:36,950
And then to my first favorite.

321
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:37,690
Oh, sorry.

00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,290
Continue.

323
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:38,650
Yeah.

324
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:41,350
No, we already know her favorite meow part.

325
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:42,430

favorite moment other than the cat meow I can't say you are

328
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:06,870

I feel like I wouldn't understand the context if you do tell

329
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:13,610
it I like when the end does his speech right before you
fight him.

330
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:14,810

Way too many people nodded there.

336
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:29,810

Yes.

340
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:36,450
He's got to show the people what he has.

341
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:37,470
Right.

342
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:38,830
Thank you so much.

343
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,930
And now we will go on to our next question.

344
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:46,030
Well, I just have a simple question.

345
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,750
Are there any games you want to stream but haven't gotten
around to doing it yet?

346
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:51,730
I have so many.

347
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,810
All right, you go first then.

348
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,050
I want to stream Alan Wake.

349
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:57,870
Wait, is that the...

350
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,610
Oh, Alan Wake at the lake?

351
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:01,130
Yeah, that's the...

352
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:01,830
That's the same, right?

353
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,050
Wait, I can't even John Wick mixed up.

354
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:04,530
Okay, yeah.

355
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:05,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

356
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:06,810
No, John Wick does not have a game.

357
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:07,270
Don't worry.

358
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:07,830
I know.

359
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,470
Oh, yeah, I want to see that.

360
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,150
I want to stream near.

361
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,350
Oh, that's a long-term commitment.

362
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,130
That theme is so long.

363
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:18,650
Yeah.

364
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:19,510
What about you?

365
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:20,570
Me?

366
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:20,930
Yeah.

367
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,670
Oh, that is hard.

368
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,550
There is a lot of games I do want to play.

369
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:28,390
I want to do Heroes of Might and Magic.

370
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:33,870
And also, oh, Club Penguin.

371
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:35,210
I've yet to stream Club Penguin.

372
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:37,950
From Club Penguin.

373
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,110
We can do the dance.

374
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:39,910
We can do the dance.

375
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:40,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

376
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:45,550
remember when we tried to record the Club Penguin dance and
then the footage was lost forever.

377
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,470
It was lost forever!

378
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,250
Yeah, they're like fandom people, we recorded it.

379
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:53,530
We recorded the Club Penguin dance but then it disappeared.

380
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:58,030
The record, like the public was not meant to see it.

381
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,070
Maybe one day we can re-record it again.

382
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:03,390
Yeah, we can re-record it again, yeah.

383
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:04,670
Oh.

384
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:16,370
Sorry, technical difficulties and I'm sure we're all waiting
for you to re-record that truly and Doki we would love to

385
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:25,870
see you play games outside of Marvel rivals that would be
awesome too I barely played the game yesterday yeah you were

386
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:42,370
you were paid to do that and great defense and on to our
next question Hi.

387
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,030
This is really a question.

388
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:48,110
I watch Mouse a lot.

389
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:57,670
So I know both of you from Mouse and I wanted to say, Min,
you were so good at her concert.

390
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:01,270
I was so excited that I could stream it.

391
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:08,210
And Doge, I just want to say congratulations in your win
from Marvel Rivals when they did the competition.

392
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:09,850
It was so fun to watch it.

393
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:17,890
Like, I don't normally watch normal Marvel Rise levels a
whole lot, so watching it was really entertaining and seeing

394
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:25,670
you, like, just your whole team, how they, like, just
completely smashed everything was so crazy to me.

395
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,830
So I just want to say thank you so much.

396
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:29,170
Oh, thank you!

397
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,190
Thank you!

398
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:32,730
Yay, that was amazing.

399
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:36,330
I also watched the concert, Mint, and you were amazing, so.

400
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:39,310
I have a concert tonight, you guys.

401
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:46,470
And I get a really, really loud cheer of everyone who's
going to the concert tonight.

402
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:57,310
And if any of you didn't cheer and you're not going, now you
know there's a concert after this at 4pm, so make sure you

403
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:57,610
attend.

404
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:58,570
It'll be amazing.

405
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:02,810
And if you're not going there, I'm doing a Project Zomboid
lady.

406
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:07,690
You guys want to join my Project Zomboid survey?

407
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,550
I'm just going to kill you.

408
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:12,190
She's gonna kill us all!

409
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:15,970
Everyone's at the concert watching the stream, the project's
on her screen.

410
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:22,550
We'll put it up in the corner, like, like, like, um, what's
the, how do they do with the chill, like a family guy

411
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,250
episode while the concert's happening.

412
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,430
Yeah, yeah, and then there's projects on foot on the corner.

413
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:30,090
Cocoa melon during the concert, you know?

414
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,590
Anyways, next question.

415
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:33,370
Hello!

416
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:35,970
Hi, Doki!

417
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:36,650
Hi, Minky.

418
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,490
Good to see y'all.

419
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,130
Hi!

420
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:38,470
Hello!

421
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:39,510
Oh!

422
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:42,530
I'm gonna throw you all in...

423
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:43,810
What's it called?

424
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:45,070
A pirate mob.

425
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:45,690
All right.

426
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:49,890
What do you think is the biggest animal you can take in a
fight?

427
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,750
The biggest animal I can take in a fight?

428
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,130
Like, fight them?

429
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,850
Like, actually beat them up?

430
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,250
Like, if you have to...

431
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,150
You have to choose the...

432
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:02,290
Like, it's life or death.

433
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:03,350
And you can have...

434
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,410
It's life or death.

435
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:08,070
And you have to pick the biggest animal you can take in a
fight.

436
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,510
Me versus 100 gorillas.

437
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:15,710
It's like that's that Pokemon thing where it's like who
would win?

438
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,650
One legendary Pokemon are a hundred lions.

439
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:21,730
I would win.

440
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:25,870
You would win against a hundred gorillas.

441
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:27,810
Put it through the simulator.

442
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:28,510
Yeah.

443
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:31,310
Put it through the animal simulator.

444
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:33,950
What about you, Doki?

445
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:34,690
All right.

446
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:37,390
If you're going to do a hundred gorillas, you're a bird.

447
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:39,950
Like you have sticks and stones for your bones.

448
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:42,410
You can't even fight!

449
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:44,190
You just face through them!

450
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,810
Not even a fight at that point!

451
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,530
I would fight...

452
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,550
Oh, that's hard.

453
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,570
Why would I make it harder for myself, though?

454
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:59,190
Like, why can't I just be like 100 ants and they'll just
like burn them through and magnify that?

455
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:02,210
They would be able to lift you up because you're so...

456
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:08,550
Oh yeah, yeah, because their ants can lift up X amount of
their body to 100 of them?

457
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:12,410
You have to be able to fly, right?

458
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:17,230
I can't just burn them with a magnifying glass.

459
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,150
I will fight a hundred ants.

460
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,450
What if it's nighttime?

461
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,310
It's nighttime?

462
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,670
When your power is like quarreling with the moon?

463
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:29,150
When the full moon is out, the ant's power gets stronger by
20 times.

464
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:31,730
No, you're talking about using a magnifying glass.

465
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:32,590
You're idiot.

466
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,550
But the moonlight!

467
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:35,990
The moonlight!

468
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:40,510
The moonlight shall intensify into the sun.

469
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:51,130
glass okay anyways thank you so much I love the disparity
between a hundred gorillas and a hundred ants I know a

470
00:25:51,130 --> 00:26:00,710
little bit of a size difference you know but and our next
question hello so my question is actually for Cookie what

Ask your question to Doki Bird!

474
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,470

00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:18,630

00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:27,270
Anyway, hello Doki.

00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:38,010
Oh, that's cute.

514
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:38,650
I have a dog.

515
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:39,530
I should do that too.

516
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:47,350
That's more like therapeutic than MQ and Riley's.

517
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:51,710
Get pet and pet them for happiness.

518
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:52,790
Yippee!

519
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:53,910
Yippee!

520
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:54,190
Yippee!

521
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:59,230
I think one of those might be a little healthier than the
other.

522
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:06,150
Not that I'm judging, but you know that great 3am
notification of Doki Bird is now streaming Marvel Bibles.

523
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:07,570
I love it.

524
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:10,130
And Shereen goes out.

525
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:12,970
for six to seven hours.

526
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:15,990
Oh, my God.

527
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,670
Why would you say that?

528
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:22,230
And our next question.

529
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:24,250
Hi, Doki.

530
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:25,010
Hi, Mint.

531
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:25,530
Hi.

532
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:31,070
In your guys' opinion, which one of you would you consider
more Sundere than the other?

533
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:37,190
I can see the loading symbol on your guys' heads.

534
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,390
Like thinking.

535
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:41,450
Sundere.

536
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:45,750
I don't think I'm Sundere.

537
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,170
I don't think so either.

538
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,650
I'm not, right?

539
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:52,490
What do you mean X?

540
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:53,390
What did you do with that?

541
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,450
What did you do with that?

542
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:56,210
What did you do with that?

543
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:59,730
It's not like a thank you or you need things that we're
going to say.

544
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:04,570
Win claims to hate us, but then she keeps coming back and
says that she misses us.

545
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:05,490
That's so true!

546
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:09,350
They're always like, Midman says, you're like, I don't hate
you guys!

547
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:11,310
That's so true.

548
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,050
You're more senior.

549
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:12,510
No!

550
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,550
You're more senior.

551
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:14,010
No!

552
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:17,590
But Doki's Gatmoi is pretty good.

553
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:18,410
Whoa!

554
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,750
Yeah, that's me.

555
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:22,250
I got the better one.

556
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:27,470
It's not about Gatmoi.

557
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:28,030
No!

558
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,050
It's too, didn't.

559
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:29,990
I don't know!

560
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:31,350
I don't know!

561
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:33,350
Yeah, you're being through there right now.

562
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:35,230
You're not through there, right?

563
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:36,410
That's like, no!

564
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:42,850
I mean, I remember the chance of she hates us at the Phantom
Thief concert, so.

565
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,510
But you guys decided that.

566
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:45,750
I never said that.

567
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:47,470
You embraced it.

568
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:48,710
I embraced it.

569
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,370
And thank you so much.

570
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:53,610
Thank you.

571
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:56,670
Wow, we got a long line of people for questions.

572
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:58,650
Okay, let's keep going through this.

573
00:30:58,790 --> 00:30:59,830
How are you guys doing?

574
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,110
Good for more questions?

575
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:02,590
Yeah, it's awesome.

576
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:04,930
Wait, when are we, when do we, when does this end?

577
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:07,330
It's like in 20 minutes, I think.

578
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:08,090
Oh, okay.

579
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:08,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

580
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:13,530
Hello, I'm Conan, named after basically every Conan you can
think of.

581
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:14,790
Conan and Brian!

582
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:15,230
Conan!

583
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:15,990
Detective Conan!

584
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:16,490
Right!

585
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:20,010
The comedian, the author of Sherlock Holmes.

586
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:21,490
Oh yeah!

587
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:24,630
Apparently it's an old Gaelic term as well, but I doubt that
one.

588
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:31,390
My question for the both of you is that if you had to force
the other to play a game that you know they would hate the

589
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,790
most, what would it be because I'm trying to get ideas for
the next charity stream?

590
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:35,610
Hey!

591
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:38,590
But then we never do charity again.

592
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,610
F them kids.

593
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:50,090
Wait, oh, what do you not like, Doki?

594
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:50,690
Tell me now.

595
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:51,430
I'm singing.

596
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:53,390
Why would I tell you?

597
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:55,530
You said it gets me.

598
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:05,610
I guess I would, oh, I feel like I would make you, I don't
make you play like a real, like a thinking game.

599
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:06,430
I like the game.

600
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:07,390
Yeah.

601
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:08,430
Like, what was it called?

602
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:09,810
The witness?

603
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:10,290
No!

604
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:11,290
Is that...

605
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,690
Wait, oh, the witness?

606
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,510
I heard that's crazy.

607
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:16,970
I know my answer though.

608
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:19,730
Yeah, what's yours?

609
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:23,770
Mine is the mystery of the druids but without a walkthrough.

610
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:24,710
Oh!

611
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:26,670
The mystery of the druids?

612
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:27,810
Yes!

613
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,190
The mystery of...

614
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:31,090
What even is this game?

615
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,310
You can play...

616
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,390
What is this guy?

617
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:34,610
This guy's screaming.

618
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:38,350
You can play it without a walkthrough.

619
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:49,270
then then did you play it yeah I played it I streamed it oh
okay then the soft puzzle surrounding a mysterious order of

620
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:58,430
druids oh my god it has mixed reviews let's look at the mega
reviews it's probably like because the game is awesome it's

621
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:09,410
probably like oh the druid face does not appear in the game
collector icon therefore you cannot fill your profile with

622
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:20,010
these hot and salty memes cannot recommend the guy with the
face the guy screaming you can't collect him apparently oh

Christmas.

626
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:47,650
That is messed up.

627
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:48,710
I didn't say it.

628
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:49,910
I don't say it.

629
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:51,390
I didn't say anything.

630
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:52,490
I didn't say anything.

631
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:54,390
Excuse me, I do not associate it.

632
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:56,090
It was deep fake.

633
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:59,130
Not yet a deep AI view.

634
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,150
It was Sora AI.

635
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:06,250
And her own Q&A is Sora.

636
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:07,850
Amazing.

637
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:13,950

00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,390
Oh, yeah, yeah.

643
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:48,590
I remember you said when you're scheduled, you're like, oh,
I can fit another stream in.

644
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:52,510
I was like, you are not fitting another stream into that
schedule.

645
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:57,170
It was like literally like starts in the morning and then
you're like at 10 p.m.

646
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:01,070
You're like, after this meeting, I can do a stream at this
time, but you are not.

647
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:05,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Yeah.

651
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:17,130
We're probably like not very healthy examples.

652
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:17,930
It's not very healthy.

653
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:19,830
We're not very healthy.

654
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:20,990
Do not learn from us.

655
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:21,870
Don't learn from us.

656
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,930
Don't take, don't follow us.

657
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:27,890
I mean, do follow us on YouTube and Twitter.

658

Twitch.

Twitch.

661
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,410
You have a TikTok?

662
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:34,750
Yeah, a TikTok.

663
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:35,170
Yeah.

665
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:39,170
You know, since I'm already post shirts and YouTube.

666
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:42,290
Apparently we should get Instagram now, too.

667
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:44,910
Like, that's what all the zoomers do now.

668
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,090
They're all on the Insta.

669
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,710

Thank you.

00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:57,870
Thank you.

675
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:58,010
Thank you.

676
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:02,350
I love that both of your coping mechanisms are incredibly
healthy and really great.

677
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:03,670
Woo, let's go.

678
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,750
Those are my, oh, she's right there, guys.

679
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:10,710
And our next question.

680
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:14,470
Okay, so I got two.

681
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:19,390
Doki, can I steal your cutout?

682
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:21,670
My cutout?

683
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:23,630
Wait, no, don't do it.

684
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:26,550
You can buy it though.

685
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:28,010
How much?

686
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:29,270
How much?

687
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:30,970
Wait, we'll do an auction.

688
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,750
We'll do an auction right now.

689
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:35,550
Do I hear a hundred dollars?

690
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:36,330
Do I hear...

691
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:39,490
You have a cut up, man?

692
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:41,370
Yeah, I'm going to go sign yours.

693
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:44,410
Oh, yeah, you can get a vandalizer, actually.

694
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,190
I'm going to go vandalize here.

695
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:48,370
That's good.

696
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:49,830
It increases the value, man.

697
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:50,830
It increases the value.

698
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:51,810
Yeah, you can sign it.

699
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:52,470
Okay, I can.

700
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:56,730
You can get a donkey bird cut out signed by me.

701
00:36:57,370 --> 00:36:59,130
Yeah, yeah, signed by me.

702
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:04,990
I think the real question is, what's the max amount you're
willing to pay for it?

703
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:05,830
You know, for charity.

704
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:08,830
I'm the charity.

705
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:17,050
But second one, real quick, for both of you.

706
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:19,830
Can I take a selfie real quick?

707
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:20,570
Yeah!

708
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:21,690
Yeah, sure.

709
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:24,530
Get out of here.

710
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:27,110
Take your cutest faces for the selfie.

711
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:29,610

712
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:30,770
Whatever one you prefer.

713
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:31,530

end we will definitely do that and our next question Hello,

716
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,690

717
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:06,870
Happy birthday!

718
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:07,490
Happy birthday!

719
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,230
Here's my question.

720
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:10,570
Look at both of you.

721
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,670
What are your hot takes, your hottest takes?

722
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:14,990
My hottest takes.

723
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:17,290
Oh, I've done so many hot takes on stream.

724
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,690
I haven't even remembered any of them.

725
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:22,450
Yeah.

726
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:25,650
Oh, I'll say one that might trigger some people.

727
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:26,650
Okay.

728
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:31,450
That you don't have to play higher than 60 frames per
second.

729
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:33,590
That one really seems to get me.

730
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:35,230
Oh no, no, no, no.

731
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:37,750
You did not, you did not say that.

732
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:40,650
You did not, you don't know the experience.

733
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:43,690
It's the easiest, it's the easiest rage bait ever.

734
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:47,390
That's not even, that's not, it's not a hot ticket.

735
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:48,890
You don't fuck even, sorry.

736
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:50,350
You don't want to leave.

737
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:59,390
We get two, wait, for PG-13, you get two S-Arts and one.

738
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,490
I already breached that.

739
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:02,450
I get two.

740
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,090
I get two as well.

741
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:08,970
That's not a, that's not a, she was clearly rage bait.

742
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:11,310
She doesn't even believe in that statement.

743
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:11,990
No, I do.

744
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:12,630
She doesn't says that.

745
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,670
Don't you don't believe in it.

746
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:15,670
You don't know.

747
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:17,730
Please, I don't know.

748
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:19,430
You don't know.

749
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:21,930
Try, okay, try and play.

750
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:23,390
Say your heart, Jake.

751
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:24,310
There's so many people dating.

752
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:27,330
Have we played above 60 braids before?

753
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:30,850
Okay, rage bait successful, everyone.

754
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:43,580
Raise your hand if you agree with me.

755
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,540
Don't enable her.

756
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,140
You know it's a lie.

757
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,820
And Doki, what's your hot take?

758

I can't remember.

759
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:59,700
I've done so many hot takes on stream that I can't remember
any of them.

760
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:04,200

like a very common though yeah though like i personally just

763
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,260

supposed to be so acidic that you're like eating you from

780
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:26,040
because he's a robot megatron megatron yeah he's my like my
second favorite transformers so that's a good choice okay i

781
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:31,940
mean the obvious choice is like hear me out it's all
transformers like this is just a transformer theme now well

782
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:37,740
and we're talking about transformers i it's not really a

00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,640
I feel like that's tame.

786
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:02,920
Megatron?

787
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,320
Yeah, I'm tame.

788
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,540

789
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,140
She's not tame, but...

00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:09,300
It's not like it's Transformers thingy, but that's okay.

We were answering a question.

question.

00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:38,820
I'm so sorry.

814
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:43,660
I was advised not to let on, so the next question.

815
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,480
Have either of you played Dungeons & Dragons before?

816
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,160
Dungeons & Dragons?

817
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,940
Oh, I was in a stream for P&D.

818
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:51,700
Ooh!

819
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,560
Yeah, how about you?

820
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:55,960
I played like two times before.

821
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,300
Like off-stream or on-stream?

822
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,060
Like one time off stream and one time on stream.

823
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,320
What was your character?

824
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:05,180
I don't remember.

825
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:11,600
I forgot my character's name.

826
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,900
I remember it was like, it was, oh, Rochella.

827
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:22,320
Her name was Rochella because she's a bard and she's like a
cockroach for a cockroach bard.

828
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:24,660
And so it was a parody of Cochella.

829
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,120
So I call it Rochella.

830
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:30,460
Oh my gosh.

831
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:36,580
Yeah, I don't remember my characters, but yeah.

832
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:37,700
I would play again.

833
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:38,280
It's fun.

834
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,880
Yeah, I would love to do it again.

835
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,020
Like a campaign or something.

836
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:42,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

837
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:43,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

838
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,180
I think I'm a terrible role player though.

839
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:47,020
I think so too.

840
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:51,180
Oh, you think, wait, are you saying you think I'm a terrible
role player?

841
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:51,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

842
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:57,460
That could be a very fun potential charity stream option.

843
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:11,360
maybe just giving you guys ideas doesn't like charity I
didn't say that you were like you said you said you said

844
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:21,900
something about children I said I said I said that I love

00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,480
Uh, one thing.

850
00:46:56,120 --> 00:47:02,900
Do you think it would be funny to move your collarbone like
a few centimeters as like a joke?

851
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:10,040
See if anybody in the pad would ever like notice it and be
like, there's nothing wrong.

852
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:17,700
It's like how like whoever that person was that made my neck
a little bit taller every day.

853
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,520
Like see if anyone noticed.

854
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,300
Mommy, you're watching me!

855
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,220
I feel like it would be hard to notice that.

856
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,520
The collarbone?

857
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:28,660
Yeah, the collarbone.

858
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,420
Why don't we just remove the collarbone?

859
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,700
Like, it's just gone.

860
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:33,200
Gone.

861
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:34,900
Reduced that.

862
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:35,700
She's got no bones.

863
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,220
Yeah, I got no bones.

864
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,400
I'm just made of boo.

865
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:40,520
Welcome to the club.

866
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:41,140
Hold this chicken.

867
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,780
Let it be fine if I take a selfie with you guys.

868
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:45,440
Of course!

869
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,200
Yeah, of course.

870
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:51,440
And look how...

871
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:52,780
cute they are.

872
00:47:57,770 --> 00:48:00,030
Man, I want a picture too.

873
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:04,010
I'll maybe get one later, winky face.

874
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:05,110
Yeah, of course.

875
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:07,750
Thank you so much.

876
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:14,970
I'm just saying as a big dokeybird fan and simp, I would
notice your collarbones being gone because I'm always

877
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:16,290
looking at them, but you know.

878
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:16,890
Whoa!

879
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:18,770
Yeah, that's why I have my shirts.

880
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:20,410
My buttons aren't fully

881
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:26,770
You're cold, you're cold, but in the mood.

882
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:27,410
Yeah.

883
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:30,910
It's like a Victorian era.

884
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:32,950
Oh my gosh, she's showing some skin.

885
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:34,890
The collarbone.

886
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:36,090
What does that mean for me now?

887
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:38,930
You the misbehavior.

888
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:41,830
Your whole fucking chest is shown.

889
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:42,550
I don't know your ribbon.

890
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:43,950
I know.

891
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:45,030
I have so much.

892
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:45,890
Yeah.

893
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:47,790
The Victorian children would be called.

894
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:49,710
Yeah, the Victorian.

895
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:50,210
It was baked.

896
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:52,150
You'll be burned for me.

897
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:53,390
A witch.

898
00:48:53,790 --> 00:48:55,570
She's showing too much skin.

899
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:56,610
Burn her.

900
00:48:58,650 --> 00:48:59,090
Awesome.

901
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:00,690
And on to our next question.

902
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:01,550
Hello.

903
00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:02,310
Hello.

904
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:07,770
My question is, do you think anytime in the future we'll see
the return of WrestleTuber?

905
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:10,130
Oh, yes.

906
00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:10,450
Okay.

907
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:15,150
So obviously this year might not have been, I know I can
say, don't worry, this year we'll have WrestleTuber.

908
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:17,270
There was a lot of stuff going on this year.

909
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:21,090
But there are plans right now for next, for real, next year,
guys.

910
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:21,630
So don't worry.

911
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:23,770
I know this year, don't worry, guys.

912
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:30,090
We have plans for it this year, but it ended up being really
bad for me when it came to a lot of stuff going on.

913
00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:36,610
So I had to postpone it to next year, but next year there
will be WrestleMania 2026.

914
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:37,930
2026.

915
00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:38,770
WrestleMania.

916
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:41,990
Thank you.

917
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:44,730
Thank you so much.

918
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:47,050
And so we're getting close to the end.

919
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:50,830
We're only going to do two or three more questions, just
letting you guys know.

00:49:53,810 --> 00:50:01,670

924
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:26,790
And our next question.

925
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:27,370
Yes.

926
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:29,810
Hi, Mint and Jogi.

927
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:30,290
Hi.

928
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:34,450
It's really great to see you both here at a holiday mess.

929
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:36,910
I have a question from Mint.

930
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:37,390
Yes.

931
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:45,590
It made me the same as what you said earlier, but you really
inspired me to actually try Metal Gear with your stream on

932
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:46,070
Thursday.

933
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:49,850
Which game do you recommend I start with?

934
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:50,810
Metal Gear Solid.

935
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:51,970
The first one.

936
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:53,730
It's Metal Gear Solid.

937
00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:55,670
I should say they're all Metal Gear.

938
00:50:57,690 --> 00:50:59,470
It's just Metal Gear Solid.

939
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:00,730
Yeah, don't go for Metal...

940
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:04,070
Well, I mean, you could go for Metal Gear 1 and 2 without
the Solid.

941
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:04,930
But Metal Gear Solid!

942
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:09,410
Wait, there's a difference between Metal Gear Solid 1 and
Metal Gear Solid?

943
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:09,910
Yes.

944
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:11,190
What?

945
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:11,850
What?

946
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:14,930
Which one is first?

947
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:15,630
Metal Gear.

948
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:19,170
Wait, there's a Metal Gear game too?

949
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:21,270
What do you think you're playing, Doki?

950
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:21,910
Oh my god.

951
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:23,710
Okay, no, no, no, no, no, no.

952
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:30,290
Like, okay, so there's Metal Gear, Metal Gear Solid, Metal
Gear Solid, whoo, okay, okay, no, it's Kojima, there's

953
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:30,630
Kojima.

954
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:35,070
But yeah, Metal Gear Solid.

955
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:37,390
Awesome, thank you so much.

956
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:41,890
I do want to let you know a bunch of people were putting a
five in the audience.

957
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:43,470
I didn't see that.

958
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:44,650
I'm going to kill you all.

959
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:45,830
I'm going to kill you myself.

960
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:47,230
That's where we got it.

961
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:50,670
At this lovely family-friendly convention.

962
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:54,930
I'm on Minecraft.

963
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:55,750
Yeah.

964
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:57,830
She should log in right now.

965
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:00,530
And on to our next question.

966
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:02,350
Hi, guys.

967
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:07,970
I'm more of a casual streamer or a casual watcher, honestly,
but it is really cool to see you guys.

968
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:16,050
My question is, if you guys are in a 1v2 or 2v2, you can tag
in one fictional character, who wins, and who are you

969
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:16,350
picking?

970
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:17,970
Goku.

971
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:21,770
That was so cool.

972
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:37,110
wait who's a bear is bear is bear is really a god okay he's
stronger than goku no no no it's literally the cat is

973
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:49,570
literally the cat god you're done everybody knows goku
always wins goku does not always win he died throughout the

974
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:53,660
old age man

975
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,900
I died and I'm still here.

976
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:00,860
They're like, lose the bean.

977
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,420
Go, go, go, eat that bean.

978
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,680
Yum, yum, go back into the fight.

979
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,340
Like, don't worry, we'll wish you

980
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:16,590
more because he'll come back.

981
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:18,950
He said he never dies.

982
00:53:19,350 --> 00:53:20,590
His whole thing is he dies.

983
00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:21,810
And then he dies.

984
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:23,070
Thank you for your question.

985
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:24,270
Thank you so much.

986
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:28,930
And real quick, I think maybe we do like a little fan vote.

987
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:30,370
Okay, so we'll cheer.

988
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:34,210
So whoever thinks Mint, Mint Goku would win.

989
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:35,850
hear a loud cheer.

990
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:43,520
And whoever thinks Doki's pairs would win.

991
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,920
I'm not gonna lie.

992
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:51,360
I think the Goku cheer was a little louder.

993
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:55,440
He says he has pretty privilege.

994
00:53:56,080 --> 00:54:00,880
My man doesn't even have pupils.

995
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:02,160
Pretty privilege.

996
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:04,480
Anyways, thank you for the question.

997
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,520
And on to our last and final question.

998
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:08,740
Oh hello!

999
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,200
Hi Min, hi Doki.

1000
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:10,980
I'm Virgil.

1001
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:13,520
So I actually also have a fighting question.

1002
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,000
You two are in a street fight real quick.

1003
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:21,220
What special, dirty, underhanded, borderline illegal move do
you use on each other?

1004
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,880
I use one of the idols as a mischievous.

1005
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:31,780
That's dirty.

1006
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,000
That is dirty.

1007
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:36,000
That is dirty.

1008
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:37,780
I think I lost.

1009
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:39,920
Yeah, I think she loses that.

1010
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:45,580
I don't know, I might activate like something maternal in
me.

1011
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,640
So I have to like protect her.

1012
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:50,700
You're manhandling her.

1013
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:52,200
That's why you talk super saiyan.

1014
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:53,560
Yeah, that's...

1015
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,160
You're like, let her go!

1016
00:54:55,900 --> 00:55:00,920
My secret dirty, unhanded trick that I would use is
mid-battle.

1017
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:05,640
Right before I lose, I do discover that there's some secret
power within me.

1018
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:15,560
unlocks and i become the shonen protagonist and then i i do
like a barrel roll through the sky and i triple last like

1019
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:28,400
seven episodes and i win i would recommend everybody to try
that you keep like becoming the main character yeah yeah

1020
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:38,280
yeah my dirty underhanded trick is that i became the main
character just discover the power within you.

1021
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:43,140
Just like raise your heads everyone give us the power for
the spirit bomb.

1022
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:52,880
