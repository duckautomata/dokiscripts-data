00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,280
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,580
Sorry, I'm like a mess right now.

3
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:46,560
I'm sorry,

4
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,220
I didn't realize.

5
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,960
I was like, okay, I still have three more minutes before the stream starts.

6
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,800
Let me go do this message real quick.

7
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,760
And then I was like typing my message out.

8
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,380
I was like, and like typing, like I had to answer some Discord work messages and an email.

9
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,740
And I looked at the clock.

10
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,300
I was like, oh my God, it's 5.01.

11
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,500
Oh my God, these messages will be so fast.

12
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,800
I can answer all of these before the stream starts.

13
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:25,120
And then now you guys might be wondering, wow, Doki, why didn't you prep those things before the stream started?

14
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:25,720
Huh?

15
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,060
Well, I have a perfectly good explanation for this.

16
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:39,240
I had Surefour message me and was like, hey, I saw that you're planning on streaming Deadlock.

17
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,620
Do you want like a quick crash course on like on how to play?

18
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,320
Because I know you're fucking miserable.

19
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,120
I'm like, yeah.

20
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:54,820
Yeah.

21
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:07,640
So, so like for an hour out, he was like teaching me how like, like he was teaching me a lot of stuff.

22
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:13,220
I was like, and by the way, that by the way, like I played four games of Deadlock.

23
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:19,660
By the way, like even before the crash course, my friends were like, hey, we'll also teach you how to play the game.

24
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:26,980
And then, and then the entire game, I was just like, I was just like, I don't know.

25
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,740
I don't know what I'm doing.

26
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,500
I don't know.

27
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,360
I'm just like, I'm like dying.

28
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:43,400
I'm like, I'm like, I'm getting, I'm getting cyber bullied in my life.

29
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,440
Like, what am I, what am I doing wrong?

30
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,460
And then we lost.

31
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,940
Obviously we lost.

32
00:03:51,140 --> 00:04:02,680
And I was looking at, I was like looking at the score and then, and then it was like, I was like, obviously I had the lowest damage because I was chucked into this fucking MMR.

33
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,020
That was obviously higher than what I'm supposed to be in because my friends have been playing Deadlock.

34
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:12,020
But then like, since I'm grouped up with them, they chucked me into their MMR.

35
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,140
So I had 7k damage.

36
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:23,840
And it was, it was like a 50 minute, it was like an hour, a 55 minute game.

37
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,340
I had 7k damage.

38
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,260
And then the next person had 25k plus damage.

39
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,920
Like the second lowest damage was 25k.

40
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,820
I had 7k.

41
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,600
We had somebody at DC.

42
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,480
Um, in the middle of the game.

43
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,120
Um, and they still had more souls than me.

44
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,510
I'm just like...

45
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:07,370
And like after the game, after the game, I was like, I'm sorry guys for whining.

46
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,510
I'm sorry.

47
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,210
I just don't understand.

48
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:17,670
I just, I was like, I'm sorry bros.

49
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,570
I'm sorry guys.

50
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:24,410
I just, I just don't understand what is playing.

51
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:28,730
Every time I play, try to play Deadlock, I play a different character.

52
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,610
So like, um, so like, I don't know.

53
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,590
I think I was playing Haze today.

54
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,130
Today I was playing Haze.

55
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:39,950
And I was just like, I don't, I don't understand.

56
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,770
I just don't know.

57
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:46,330
I got thrown into the pack of wolves.

58
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,590
Anyway, yeah, it's like trial by fire.

59
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,070
They literally threw me into the middle of the swimming pool.

60
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,410
And was like, you're going to learn how to swim right now.

61
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,430
It's like the pool is like, like 20 feet deep.

62
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,290
And they just threw me in the middle of the pool.

63
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:07,830
It was like, all right, it's time to fucking play Deadlock.

64
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,570
Anyway, right after that.

65
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,850
I went into the crash course with Surefour.

66
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,970
And then he actually taught me a lot of stuff that I didn't know.

67
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,770
I was like, wait, what?

68
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,890
He's like, oh yeah, you should know about this.

69
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,710
Now that you've like played, you just played, right?

70
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,450
I was like, yeah.

71
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,610
He's like, oh yeah, you should know about this, right?

72
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,130
I was like, what?

73
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:31,510
You know, you should know about like how you can, you can slide and everything.

74
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,130
I was like, slide?

75
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:39,330
He's like, yeah, the movement tech, you know, dash slide.

76
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:42,230
I'm like, dash slide?

77
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,130
I knew about the dash.

78
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,030
I didn't know there was a slide part.

79
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,450
So anyway, I learned about...

80
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,450
Yeah, and then you can do dash jump slide.

81
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:53,870
I was like, dash jump slide?

82
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,010
There's, there's additional movement?

83
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,410
I was like, what is this?

84
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,590
I was like, wait, what is this?

85
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,450
It's in the official tutorial.

86
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,850
Guys, the last time I did the official tutorial.

87
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,750
Was in April.

88
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:11,350
Guys.

89
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:15,110
You guys, you can't fucking be like...

90
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,710
It was in the official tutorial.

91
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:20,290
The last time I looked at the tutorial.

92
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:26,030
Was in April when the game was first introduced as a closed beta.

93
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:33,170
When, when, when the game had no name.

94
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:38,230
The game literally had no name yet.

95
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:39,890
No official...

96
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,950
It wasn't even called Deadlock yet.

97
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:45,830
It wasn't even called Deadlock yet.

98
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,950
When I got to play for the first time.

99
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:53,910
So...

100
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,030
So yeah, anyway.

101
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,190
Like he...

102
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:00,030
And then he was like, yeah, play Abram.

103
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,150
I was like, why?

104
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,930
And he's like, you don't have to aim.

105
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,050
And I was like, oh, cool.

106
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:05,310
.

107
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:05,810
.

108
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,770
He's like, I was like, what do I play?

109
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,870
And he's like, play Abram.

110
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,470
And I'm like, oh, okay.

111
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,230
.

112
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,010
For real.

113
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,430
So the reason why...

114
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,210
I'll show you guys why.

115
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,630
I'll go into the training room.

116
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:27,070
Why, like, Abram is like the character to play.

117
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:30,830
Because literally, he was teaching me the combos for Abram.

118
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,050
And he's like, yeah, you're going to be playing against...

119
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,030
Obviously, you're going to be playing against other new players.

120
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,850
And like, noobs don't know how to parry.

121
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,590
Like, so you can abuse that shit.

122
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,150
So like, you know, you can...

123
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,110
You can give them a very hard time.

124
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,690
Yeah, and then there's like guides.

125
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:46,570
You can...

126
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,170
There's like guides.

127
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,210
And everything.

128
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,450
I like how somebody was like, there's a parry...

129
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:52,990
Look, see?

130
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:53,810
Look, see?

131
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,230
Some people have played this game.

132
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,530
And they're like, there's a parry?

133
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,670
Yes, apparently...

134
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,350
There's a parry.

135
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:00,670
That's what I'm saying.

136
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,030
Noobs don't know how to parry.

137
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,630
They don't know how to parry.

138
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,510
You can...

139
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,490
Exactly.

140
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,570
They don't teach you that.

141
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:13,370
They...

142
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:14,250
I told you.

143
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:15,190
That's like...

144
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,010
That's like Sherpa was like, yeah, you got it.

145
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:17,670
You should play it.

146
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,650
You should play Abram.

147
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,410
They don't...

148
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:27,010
He's like, yeah, no, you can abuse that shit.

149
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,730
Because fucking noobs don't know how to parry.

150
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,530
Anyway.

151
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:30,470
So...

152
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,290
So that's why...

153
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,730
That's why he told me to play Abram.

154
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:35,650
And he was like...

155
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,830
He was teaching me like, what to buy for Abram.

156
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,330
And like, what I can do to like, destroy noobs.

157
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,310
I bet you I'm gonna get destroyed.

158
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,330
I'm gonna...

159
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,770
I'm gonna get destroyed anyway.

160
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,350
Like, I feel like...

161
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,350
I feel like...

162
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:48,950
He teach...

163
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:49,390
He's gonna teach...

164
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,410
He taught me all of this.

165
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,070
Hoping I retain my knowledge.

166
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:54,350
I'm gonna give it to you guys straight.

167
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:57,810
I will be very surprised if like, I...

168
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:00,190
I don't crash out and burn in my first game.

169
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:00,730
I...

170
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,630
I'm gonna be...

171
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:05,950
I'm gonna be very surprised if I am not...

172
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:11,550
If I am not bottom everything at the end of the first game.

173
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,250
Another thing I like...

174
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,410
It was so painful.

175
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:17,110
I was like, why isn't there a surrender game?

176
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,830
And then apparently...

177
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:24,250
I was told that Valve does not put surrenders in any of their games.

178
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,630
Cause you suffer.

179
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,790
You have to suffer till the very end.

180
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:29,910
So...

181
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:30,430
So...

182
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:30,670
So...

183
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:30,690
So...

184
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:30,710
So...

185
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,210
So...

186
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:32,490
So...

187
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:32,810
So...

188
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,110
This might be just like...

189
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:34,810
Who knows?

190
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:37,530
I might only play two games if I'm lucky.

191
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:39,910
Like...

192
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:46,250
Apparently Dota, after so many years, does not have a surrender button for Dota.

193
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:47,730
So...

194
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:51,290
So...

195
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:52,950
We'll see how it goes.

196
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,190
We just gotta suffer, I guess.

197
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:58,530
Um...

198
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:59,170
But yeah.

199
00:10:59,370 --> 00:10:59,730
Sorry.

200
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:01,570
I'm just charging my mouse right now.

201
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,850
I forgot to charge my mouse.

202
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:03,350
I was like...

203
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:03,950
I was like...

204
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:04,190
Oh yeah.

205
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:04,630
Let's see.

206
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:05,270
Let's see how...

207
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,310
It's been a while since I charged my...

208
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:07,970
Uh...

209
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:08,610
G Pro...

210
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:08,990
Uh...

211
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:09,570
Superlight.

212
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,790
Let's see how much battery I have left.

213
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:12,870
7%.

214
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:13,670
So that's...

215
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,510
That's what I'm doing right now.

216
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:16,150
I...

217
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,150
It's at...

218
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:17,650
I...

219
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:18,130
I'll...

220
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:18,410
I'll...

221
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:18,710
I'll...

222
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,410
I'll use it at 40%.

223
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:22,730
So I'm just charging my mouse today.

224
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:23,390
Right now.

225
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:23,770
Like...

226
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:24,490
Legitimately.

227
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,710
Legitimately, it went from 7% to 38%.

228
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:28,670
Um...

229
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:29,670
And...

230
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:31,470
In 13 minutes.

231
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,870
So I feel like that's pretty fast.

232
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:33,550
Like...

233
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:35,930
It's...

234
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,050
It's pretty fast.

235
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:37,510
You know?

236
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:37,930
Like...

237
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:38,170
In...

238
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,210
In 13 minutes.

239
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,010
It's already at...

240
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:41,110
Almost at 40%.

241
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,030
So...

242
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:42,930
We're okay.

243
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:43,890
We're...

244
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:44,290
We're fu...

245
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:44,830
We're okay.

246
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:47,750
Um...

247
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,310
What else?

248
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:51,430
What else was I told to remember for...

249
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:53,330
Um...

250
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,930
What else was I told to remember about Deadlock?

251
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,930
Oh no.

252
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:57,930
I'm not retaining anything.

253
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:58,890
I'm...

254
00:11:58,890 --> 00:11:59,170
I'm...

255
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,650
I'm not retaining anything.

256
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:02,650
But yeah.

257
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:03,370
Um...

258
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,210
Abrams...

259
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:07,630
The character Abrams is literally just a fighting game.

260
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:07,990
Like...

261
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,990
You're just punching people.

262
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:09,390
Like...

263
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,630
You don't have to shoot your gun.

264
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,510
You just...

265
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:14,810
His entire moveset and combos is just...

266
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:15,350
You brought...

267
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,470
You beat the shit out of people.

268
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,490
So like...

269
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:18,130
I hope...

270
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,950
I hope I play against enough...

271
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:23,470
I hope I actually am playing against noobs that are just like...

272
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,350
That are just as bad as the game as I am.

273
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,370
So I can take advantage to the...

274
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,250
To the part...

275
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,150
I hope I get...

276
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:29,750
I hope I get Abrams.

277
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:30,890
I swear to God.

278
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,250
I spent an hour fucking trying to learn Abrams.

279
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,850
I swear to fucking God.

280
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:38,610
I swear to fucking God.

281
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:41,690
I spent an hour trying to learn this character.

282
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:45,430
And if I do not get Abrams as a first pick...

283
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,850
I swear to fucking God.

284
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,450
After everything I've been through.

285
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:51,430
Getting...

286
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,010
I'm getting my shit beat in.

287
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,770
But I'm fucking sure for it.

288
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,270
That plays that game...

289
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:57,690
Like...

290
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:00,270
8 plus hours almost every day on stream.

291
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,370
Since April.

292
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,250
I swear to fucking God.

293
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,890
I'm gonna be so mad.

294
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,430
If my first game gets fucked over that fast.

295
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:12,970
Anyway...

296
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:17,170
This is literally my first MOBA.

297
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:23,030
This is my first MOBA game ever.

298
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:27,150
Which is why I have a lot of hate...

299
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,370
Towards MOBAs.

300
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:29,290
Because I don't understand.

301
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,250
Well...

302
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,790
Hate is a very strong word.

303
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:32,930
And I stand behind it.

304
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,350
And I...

305
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,570
I don't take it back.

306
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:44,130
Anyway...

307
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:48,710
Anyway...

308
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:50,950
Anyway...

309
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:51,750
No, I've not...

310
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,890
Never actually...

311
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:53,630
You guys are like...

312
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,770
What about Pokemon Unite?

313
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,190
Pokemon Unite is...

314
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:59,050
Is barely classified as a MOBA.

315
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,170
It's like a fucking...

316
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,770
It's like an iPhone game.

317
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,890
It's a fucking phone game.

318
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,870
It's literally a phone game.

319
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:06,830
Like it's not...

320
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:07,850
Oh my...

321
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,030
I'm sorry.

322
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:09,850
I'm sorry.

323
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:10,470
I know I like...

324
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,050
Did a fucking eSports thing.

325
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,350
Like a Twitch Rivals thing for Pokemon Unite.

326
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,190
But it...

327
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:15,950
It's such...

328
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,170
I barely...

329
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,510
It's like...

330
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,870
Baby's first MOBA.

331
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:22,750
I'm sorry.

332
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:25,350
I did a Twitch Rivals for Pokemon Unite.

333
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,290
But like...

334
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:26,990
I can't...

335
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,010
I can't see...

336
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:33,050
I don't categorize Pokemon Unite as same as like the shit I had to deal with in Deadlock.

337
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:35,490
Anyway...

338
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:38,930
Anyway...

339
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:45,170
Like I said...

340
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,850
A long time ago...

341
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,150
My friends back then...

342
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,410
Tried to teach me to play League.

343
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,570
I plugged in the...

344
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:55,330
I plugged in the first game they threw me in.

345
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,890
When I had to learn League.

346
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:57,790
And I was like...

347
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:58,130
Sorry.

348
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,270
My internet crashed.

349
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:01,930
That's literally...

350
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:02,930
I was just like...

351
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:03,570
Oh sorry.

352
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:04,990
My internet crashed.

353
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:05,510
Well...

354
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,330
Too bad.

355
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:07,010
I guess.

356
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,190
Too bad.

357
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:12,090
And then I never touched League again after that.

358
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:15,690
I managed to never have to touch League after that.

359
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:16,530
Anyway...

360
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:17,910
So why am I playing Deadlock?

361
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,390
If I had such a disdain for...

362
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,730
For MOBAs?

363
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,370
Well...

364
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:25,330
I keep being told by other FPS players.

365
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,770
Even though this is not an FPS game.

366
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,350
That...

367
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:32,290
This is gonna be the next big game.

368
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:33,030
And that...

369
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,830
If I learn...

370
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:35,670
To get...

371
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,390
If I finally learn MOBA mechanics.

372
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:39,570
Maybe...

373
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,110
I will change my mind.

374
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,130
Maybe...

375
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,430
I will have a character development.

376
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:46,830
And...

377
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,850
A character development arc.

378
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,710
And actually learn...

379
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:51,490
To love...

380
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,510
These types of games.

381
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,230
So...

382
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,090
I decided...

383
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,750
By sheer peer pressure.

384
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:03,730
Because I am very easily persuaded and manipulated into...

385
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,320
Because I...

386
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,680
Because I want people to...

387
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,780
I want to fit in...

388
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,660
In society.

389
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,800
I decided to try Deadlock again.

390
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,900
On stream.

391
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,160
So...

392
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,460
Here we are.

393
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,760
I want to fit in.

394
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,060
I want my peers to be like, Whoa!

395
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,260
That's right, girl!

396
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,460
Join us in Deadlock!

397
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,900
And I was like, Whoa!

398
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,200
I want to fit in the society!

399
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,820
And I also learned Deadlock like all the other cool players!

400
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,800
So here we are.

401
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,720
Trying it again.

402
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,900
And I remember... I'm trying... Oh my gosh.

403
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,820
What did they say?

404
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,380
They were like, Be careful.

405
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,480
It can change you.

406
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,600
Yeah.

407
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,580
Don't let the toxicity overtake you.

408
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,140
MOBAs change a person.

409
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:24,040
One of my friends was like, I was like, Oh no.

410
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,660
Let me see.

411
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,440
I'll show you guys the image you guys want to see in visual form.

412
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:43,100
So like, if I ever actually learn to love MOBAs, I can actually get even more toxic, which is crazy to think about.

413
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:58,760
So if I ever actually learn to like Deadlock, I will have a reverse character development.

414
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,620
More toxic?

415
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,980
Is that even possible?

416
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,700
I mean, I got to this point without ever learning a MOBA game.

417
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,180
So like, it would be crazy if that's a possibility.

418
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:17,040
Like I got to that point of toxicity while ever learning MOBAs.

419
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,840
So I could actually go further.

420
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:19,820
All right.

421
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,740
Anyway, let me teach.

422
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,960
Let me not teach you guys.

423
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,500
I barely can teach myself.

424
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,240
Let me.

425
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,340
Let me.

426
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,140
Okay.

427
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,720
So this is what I learned.

428
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,460
So anyway.

429
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,220
Oh yeah.

430
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:31,740
By the way.

431
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,220
So like I learned you can like do builds and stuff.

432
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,520
So this is my, the one, the build.

433
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,860
So you can browse builds here.

434
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,520
And I like favorited this.

435
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,260
And then this teaches you what to upgrade, which I'm going to fucking forget anyway.

436
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,300
I know I'm going to forget this.

437
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,460
So this is the build I'm on.

438
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,940
It's called Punchy McFace Puncher.

439
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,280
Because I was like, it was the most popular.

440
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,660
So I was like, let's do that.

441
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,160
Punchy McFace Puncher.

442
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,240
So this is what, this is what Shurford taught me.

443
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:11,360
I charge in, I punch, and I hit.

444
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,180
That's it.

445
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,800
So I'm doing, that's all I have to do.

446
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,000
Or.

447
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,740
Or I do this.

448
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,140
I smash.

449
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,360
Doki smash.

450
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,620
And then, wait.

451
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,800
Oh, that's my teammate.

452
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:25,300
Whoops.

453
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:25,940
Oh no.

454
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,040
So I need to like change the settings.

455
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:30,640
Definitely.

456
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:31,600
Okay.

457
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,240
Video.

458
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,240
We'll do fastest.

459
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,200
We don't need to look pretty here.

460
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:36,800
Okay.

461
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,420
There you go.

462
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,680
This game looks like shit now.

463
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:43,720
Okay.

464
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,280
I'm sorry.

465
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,200
This game looks like.

466
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:46,840
Okay.

467
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,580
Anyway.

468
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,300
How do I.

469
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,200
Wait.

470
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,780
How do I make it to the sandbox?

471
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:51,820
Um.

472
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:52,980
Wait.

473
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,420
How do I change the sandbox?

474
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,620
Oh my god.

475
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,040
Turn off upscaling.

476
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,100
Oh, maybe I do that.

477
00:19:59,300 --> 00:19:59,580
Okay.

478
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,240
Let me try.

479
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:01,460
Uh.

480
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,000
Okay.

481
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,500
We'll do this.

482
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,360
And then.

483
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,840
What do I do?

484
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:06,660
Here.

485
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,660
Do I.

486
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:08,700
Okay.

487
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:08,940
What.

488
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:09,280
Guys.

489
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,020
How do I fix.

490
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,220
Guys.

491
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,300
How do I fix.

492
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:12,720
Guys.

493
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:14,820
Hold tap.

494
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,040
Okay.

495
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:15,440
Hold tap.

496
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:15,840
What do I.

497
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,900
What do I turn off to make myself better?

498
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,480
Render quality at a hundred percent.

499
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,400
All.

500
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,000
Okay.

501
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:22,420
Remove.

502
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,460
There's no motion there.

503
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,340
Oh my god.

504
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:25,820
There is.

505
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:26,420
I'm.

506
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,300
Automatically.

507
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,420
Nevermind.

508
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,820
I'm off to a good start.

509
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,240
By the way.

510
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:34,660
It's my birthday.

511
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,640
Hope you have fun with dialogue.

512
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,240
Thank you.

513
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,180
Thank you for the super chat.

514
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:37,500
Thank you.

515
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,160
Thank you.

516
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,740
Happy birthday to you.

517
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,340
Happy birthday to you.

518
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,020
Happy birthday dear Mega.

519
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,780
Happy birthday to you.

520
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,160
Yeah.

521
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,100
Let's go.

522
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:47,540
Okay.

523
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:48,320
Guys.

524
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,200
What do I have to do?

525
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:51,760
Dashboard.

526
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,000
Oh wait.

527
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,820
Why am I at 120 frames?

528
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,420
The fuck?

529
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:57,760
180.

530
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:58,640
Okay.

531
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,020
Guys.

532
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,420
What do I do?

533
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:01,500
To.

534
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,260
Cause like.

535
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:02,740
Obviously.

536
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,060
I'm lagging a little bit.

537
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:04,480
Guys.

538
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,360
Other than uninstall.

539
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,020
We'll do that later.

540
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:06,500
Uh.

541
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,040
What.

542
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:11,880
What should.

543
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:12,840
Uh.

544
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,060
FPS to lower?

545
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:15,880
Crank error.

546
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,180
Okay.

547
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:16,460
Wait.

548
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:16,880
Really?

549
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,080
Okay.

550
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:17,200
Oh.

551
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:17,980
Is this for like.

552
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:18,960
Dashboard.

553
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:19,380
Uh.

554
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:20,580
Wait.

555
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:20,880
I thought.

556
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,420
But like.

557
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,460
Post process bloom?

558
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:23,780
It's only.

559
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,000
Oh.

560
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,100
It's only the dashboard?

561
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:25,680
Wait.

562
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,240
How about like regular then?

563
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,520
I don't even.

564
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,840
What was the default?

565
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:30,500
I don't remember.

566
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,500
110 is fine.

567
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,480
That's fine.

568
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,240
Oh.

569
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:33,560
Here you go.

570
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:33,920
In game.

571
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,120
Oh.

572
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:34,620
There it is.

573
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,200
Okay.

574
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:35,920
200.

575
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,320
I'll do 200.

576
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,120
I don't need.

577
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,800
I have a 208.

578
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,100
Nah.

579
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,360
Let's do 240 actually.

580
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,420
Plus.

581
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,080
And quality.

582
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:44,840
FS.

583
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:45,940
R2.

584
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:46,780
Quality.

585
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:47,920
Uh.

586
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:48,940
Or stretch.

587
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,540
Plus 100.

588
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,220
Render.

589
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:50,720
This?

590
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,020
Okay.

591
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,100
Render quality.

592
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,460
The 100%.

593
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,420
What else?

594
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,480
Guys.

595
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,720
The frames.

596
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,980
Frames are very important.

597
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,280
It's very important.

598
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,580
In the shooter game.

599
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,100
You.

600
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,180
Use FS2?

601
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:05,900
This one?

602
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,580
Moderate.

603
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:09,820
To.

604
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,520
Consistent.

605
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:11,820
Okay.

606
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,720
I'll put it here.

607
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:13,980
Uh.

608
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,260
And then what?

609
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,500
What do I do after that?

610
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,040
Guys.

611
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,000
Uh.

612
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,820
I'm going to put the frame lower.

613
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,120
Uh.

614
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,140
Quality.

615
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:29,980
Okay.

616
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,020
All right.

617
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,000
Is there anything else?

618
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,720
Turn off distance.

619
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,080
Field.

620
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:34,780
Field shadows.

621
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,500
Do we need.

622
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,480
Do we need shadows?

623
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:38,760
No.

624
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,680
We don't need shadows.

625
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:39,800
Okay.

626
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,500
That should be good.

627
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:42,720
Right?

628
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:43,640
Apply.

629
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:46,580
Okay.

630
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,520
We should be okay.

631
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,560
We should be okay now.

632
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:49,920
Okay.

633
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,140
So.

634
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,220
Uh.

635
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,060
No death.

636
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:52,600
No cooldown.

637
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:52,920
Okay.

638
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,860
So this is what I was taught.

639
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,960
I was really taught to do this.

640
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,400
And then do that.

641
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,220
And then pew.

642
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,440
And then do this.

643
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,220
And then that.

644
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,160
And then pew.

645
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:01,880
So apparently.

646
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,060
You can parry.

647
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:03,980
So you go here.

648
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:04,660
And like.

649
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,660
Learn how to parry.

650
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:07,660
Okay.

651
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,300
Sorry.

652
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,220
And then go here.

653
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:09,780
And then learn how to parry.

654
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,520
Please.

655
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,520
Please sir.

656
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:15,840
There we go.

657
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,960
And then I was also taught this.

658
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,600
And I had to do that.

659
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,760
And then pew.

660
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:25,900
And then boom.

661
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:26,700
And then charge.

662
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,440
And then smash.

663
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,040
So that's like literally everything I was taught.

664
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:30,580
That was.

665
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,040
That was.

666
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,080
And then.

667
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,180
That's all I know.

668
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,640
That's literally all I know.

669
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:37,580
That's.

670
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,400
That's.

671
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,400
Alright.

672
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,240
So.

673
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,200
Okay.

674
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:41,440
So.

675
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,780
Now I'm gonna get absolutely destroyed.

676
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:45,860
Yeah.

677
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,420
It's F.

678
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:47,800
F is.

679
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,420
I don't know if.

680
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:48,900
I think.

681
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,180
I don't know if F is.

682
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,180
If this is universal one.

683
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,280
I'll never use the parry.

684
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:54,740
But like.

685
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,520
I hope the other players don't use the parry too.

686
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,080
That's what I'm hoping for.

687
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,020
As long as the other players don't use it.

688
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,380
We're fine.

689
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,160
Oh my god.

690
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:02,360
Please.

691
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,660
So this is where you test the parry.

692
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,180
Woo.

693
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,100
Look at that.

694
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:08,580
Yeah.

695
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,060
Alright.

696
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,720
We should be fine.

697
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,080
Alright.

698
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:11,440
We're going back.

699
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,080
We're gonna go straight in.

700
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:12,740
Alright.

701
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,080
Guys.

702
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,680
We'll see how this goes.

703
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,800
We'll see how this goes.

704
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,460
Play deadlock.

705
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,460
I swear to god.

706
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:22,560
This is literally the only character I know how to play right now.

707
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,340
And then.

708
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,120
We'll try these guys.

709
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,360
These three.

710
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,120
I sort of vaguely know.

711
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,980
I sort of vaguely know how to play these two.

712
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:31,880
Because like.

713
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:32,880
Um.

714
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,960
I read a little bit.

715
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,360
So we'll see.

716
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,060
Oh.

717
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,740
Oh my god.

718
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,420
I'm so tired.

719
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,000
I'm so nervous.

720
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,060
I'm so nervous.

721
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,080
Learning new games is always so stressful.

722
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,280
I swear to god.

723
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,040
If I'm not able.

724
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:49,400
Okay.

725
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,100
Thank god.

726
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,000
I swear to god.

727
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,860
If I'm not able.

728
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,240
I'm gonna.

729
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,300
I swear to god.

730
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:56,880
You don't want.

731
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,460
You don't want.

732
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,000
Like it.

733
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:58,740
When I'm mad.

734
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,060
Okay.

735
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:04,820
Here we go.

736
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,320
It's time to learn.

737
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,420
It's time to fucking learn.

738
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:12,580
Um.

739
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,940
I have no.

740
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,420
You guys are gonna be yelling at me.

741
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:16,980
A lot.

742
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:18,680
You're.

743
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:18,960
You're.

744
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,080
You're gonna be yelling at me.

745
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,560
A lot.

746
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:21,940
Lot.

747
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,520
Because I don't know what's going on.

748
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:30,660
Look.

749
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,760
I do four damage.

750
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,720
Also it's like fucking Kovacs too.

751
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,040
Like the deny and stuff.

752
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,500
Like the.

753
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,820
You have to deny people.

754
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:40,600
Oh.

755
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,580
I swear to god.

756
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,480
If you steal my fucking Kovacs.

757
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,480
I swear to god.

758
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,160
I'm already like.

759
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,840
Having a rough time.

760
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,780
What is he doing here?

761
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,220
Get out.

762
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,020
Stop.

763
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,060
So this is the MOBA part of the game.

764
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,580
Where you have to just.

765
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,740
Shoot them.

766
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,600
Until you can't shoot no more.

767
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,780
Are you serious?

768
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,580
Who shot me?

769
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,940
Don't make me fucking come over here.

770
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,660
Don't make me come over here.

771
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:10,880
You.

772
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,140
No.

773
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:11,400
I can't.

774
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,260
I can come over here.

775
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,140
I will charge.

776
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,220
I was taught how to melee.

777
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,820
Oh yeah.

778
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,540
If I do this.

779
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,680
Like it instead.

780
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,000
Takes the.

781
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,200
The Kovac shit.

782
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:24,980
Away.

783
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,520
Can you show us?

784
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,420
Show you guys what?

785
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,580
Am I laning by myself?

786
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:33,980
Are you?

787
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:34,800
What?

788
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,020
Wait.

789
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:37,640
Wait.

790
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,180
What do you mean?

791
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,580
I'm laning by myself.

792
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:40,900
I'm laning by myself.

793
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,320
I'm laning by myself.

794
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:41,340
I'm laning by myself.

795
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,280
What do you mean?

796
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,880
Where's my buddy?

797
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,180
I've never had to do solo lanes.

798
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:47,620
Please.

799
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,120
I don't know what I'm doing.

800
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,120
I.

801
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,080
Please don't do this to me.

802
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:53,980
Please.

803
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,960
I'm in a solo lane.

804
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,500
This is bad.

805
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,800
This is bad.

806
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,280
I'm already.

807
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:00,900
Like.

808
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,820
It's already rough for me.

809
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,400
Please.

810
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,200
Please.

811
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:12,460
No!

812
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,060
Okay, I'll upgrade now.

813
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:15,500
Alright.

814
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,600
Here we go.

815
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,320
I just follow the guide.

816
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,040
That's how I do things.

817
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,200
Guys, I told you.

818
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,140
You're gonna be yelling at me a lot, guys.

819
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:25,560
I know.

820
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:26,420
Wait.

821
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,100
Don't make me come over here.

822
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,440
Don't make me come over here.

823
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,060
I will.

824
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,480
Don't fucking make me walk over there.

825
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,720
Because I will.

826
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,060
I have my charge.

827
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,380
You think I won't?

828
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,400
You might have range.

829
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,960
You might have range.

830
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:50,220
But the moment you get over here, I swear to God, I will fucking charge you.

831
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:54,560
Please.

832
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,500
No, I couldn't deny him.

833
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,800
But I wanna upgrade this.

834
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,360
Fine.

835
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:04,720
Wait.

836
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,520
Get over here!

837
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,480
You know you want to.

838
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,360
You know you wanna get over here.

839
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,280
I will fucking charge soon.

840
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:18,880
The moment I can have the ability to charge at you, I will fucking do it.

841
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,820
She's cucked.

842
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,100
Oh my God.

843
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,100
Get out.

844
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,200
Get out of here.

845
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,340
You fucking miss.

846
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,140
You're so bad.

847
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,080
I don't know what I'm doing, but at least I'm not missing.

848
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,100
Like...

849
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:41,140
At least I'm not missing, guys.

850
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,140
Oh, I don't even need a... I don't even need an aim down sight.

851
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:47,760
Get over here.

852
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,500
I'm fucking heading over.

853
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,800
I'm gonna head over.

854
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,080
I'm gonna fucking... Oh, you're gonna run away, you fucking pussy.

855
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,000
You know.

856
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,720
You know what I wanna do.

857
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,080
You fucking know.

858
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,920
You fucking know what I wanna do.

859
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,080
Alright.

860
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,120
That's fine.

861
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,780
You're gonna deny me my stuff?

862
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,900
You're such a... You're such a bitch!

863
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,100
I'm fucking coming over.

864
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,800
I don't fucking care.

865
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,720
Fuck off, actually.

866
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,920
How you're gonna leave?

867
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,380
I can't believe that's fucking right.

868
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:33,840
He fucking ran, this little fucker.

869
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:38,260
I can't believe he actually ran.

870
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,840
Oh, I'm going to go crazy.

871
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,060
I'm actually going to fucking go crazy.

872
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,700
Holy shit.

873
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,720
I'm going to go crazy here.

874
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,720
This 1v1.

875
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,700
But I'm so low, I can't.

876
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,480
Push him.

877
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,140
Oh my god.

878
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,380
I'm just way too low.

879
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,380
Where is he?

880
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,140
Alright.

881
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,700
I'm already losing.

882
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:11,640
No, you don't understand.

883
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,680
When nothing happens, I go crazy.

884
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,580
Like, you don't...

885
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:20,440
I go crazy when nothing is happening in here.

886
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,520
It makes me go insane.

887
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:27,700
Fucker.

888
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,840
This has to be, like, the most unlucky matchup for me.

889
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,040
Where is he?

890
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,640
Oh my god.

891
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,400
Please.

892
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,500
It's just a really...

893
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,160
He's literally won.

894
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,340
He's literally won.

895
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,220
Fucking heal me, creep.

896
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,320
Like, when nothing happens.

897
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,280
Oh my god.

898
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,260
When nothing...

899
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,100
I swear to god.

900
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,460
If he fucking takes this too.

901
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,360
I go insane.

902
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,180
It's more insane than usual.

903
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,180
Is he going to heal?

904
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:13,860
Okay.

905
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,040
Where is he?

906
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,780
Am I by myself?

907
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:20,760
Where the...

908
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,800
Oh my god.

909
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,220
He went all the way back.

910
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,220
Bitch.

911
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,540
Fucking bitch.

912
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,000
That's fine.

913
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:31,880
That's fine.

914
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,300
I don't know what my team is doing, but that's fine.

915
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,200
That's fine.

916
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:42,700
My team might be, like, getting fucked over.

917
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,900
But that's okay.

918
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,180
That's okay.

919
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,280
Bro.

920
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,920
You went back to spawn?

921
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,120
You fucking loser.

922
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,360
I'll go back to spawn.

923
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,020
Fuck off.

924
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,680
I'll go back to spawn and full heal.

925
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,540
I might as well.

926
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,040
Okay, I'm gonna full heal.

927
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:05,860
Guys, I...

928
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,140
I'll try not to go too crazy.

929
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,840
Okay, I hear you.

930
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,880
If he's gonna full heal, I'll full heal.

931
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,800
How long is the lane experience?

932
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:27,260
The moment it hits the 15 minute mark, I actually will go insane.

933
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:34,840
I go insane because nothing has happened.

934
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:41,980
It has happened.

935
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:46,500
I need you guys to know it has absolutely happened.

936
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,800
I have absolutely...

937
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,800
It has absolutely...

938
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,240
Ow.

939
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,540
You bitch.

940
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,800
You fucker.

941
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,840
You're an actual fucker.

942
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,340
I hate this guy.

943
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,960
I hate him.

944
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,180
I hate him so much.

945
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,480
I'm getting hard... I don't wanna be in this lane!

946
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:22,820
All he does is jump!

947
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,200
Everything I learned is useless!

948
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,240
Everything I learned...

949
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,700
It didn't matter!

950
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,660
It didn't fucking matter!

951
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:44,520
I learned this character just to get fucking hard counted by this grandpa!

952
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,760
Oh my god, you're such a whore.

953
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,220
You're actually such a whore.

954
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,900
I hope this keynotch...

955
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:58,860
I hope your character gets nerfed to the fucking ground.

956
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,500
And you have nothing else in your life.

957
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,840
Imagine like clearly...

958
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,560
Clearly you played this character so much!

959
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,600
But you're in my elo!

960
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:14,420
Like how fucking bad are you to be in my elo?

961
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,600
After all of that!

962
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:16,560
Like...

963
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,620
I barely know what I'm doing and yet you're here.

964
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,240
You're here in this elo.

965
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,020
Don't bully it.

966
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,740
It's not even grandma!

967
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,260
It's a grandpa!

968
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,340
Okay, maybe...

969
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,020
Oh, there's a trap.

970
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,840
I'm fucking farming.

971
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:35,860
Bro, fuck this.

972
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:36,960
Bro, okay.

973
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,320
I swear to god, if you fucking...

974
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,000
Yeah, you see that?

975
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,480
I'm fucking... I'm gonna punch your ass.

976
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,740
I'm gonna go fucking farm this.

977
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,300
That's fucking right.

978
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,200
I'm gonna steal your creep.

979
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,240
I'm gonna steal this.

980
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,940
Oh yeah, you're scared?

981
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:55,800
You're so scared.

982
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,000
Yeah, I see you.

983
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:57,940
That's okay.

984
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,500
I see you.

985
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,700
You're so fucking scared.

986
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:00,700
That's right.

987
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,460
Get over here!

988
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,920
Fucking get over here!

989
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,680
Yeah, you can't do jack shit!

990
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,760
I'm fucking taking this!

991
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,300
You can't aim for this too!

992
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:09,900
That's right!

993
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,420
You're so bad.

994
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,740
You're so fucking...

995
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,440
Oh yeah!

996
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,260
That's fucking...

997
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,480
Wait, is that your friend?

998
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,020
What the fu...

999
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:22,440
Okay.

1000
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,540
I...

1001
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,700
Okay.

1002
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,920
Now you have friends?

1003
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,240
Like...

1004
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,000
What?

1005
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,680
Okay.

1006
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,220
Bro...

1007
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,300
Actually, fuck you.

1008
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,800
Where are my friends?

1009
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,160
Like, where...

1010
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,060
Where are my friends?

1011
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,280
Okay.

1012
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:41,760
Okay.

1013
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,400
Bro.

1014
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:42,660
Okay.

1015
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:43,460
Okay.

1016
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,320
Nothing's happening.

1017
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,340
It's...

1018
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,980
We're at the 15-minute mark soon.

1019
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,380
We're almost there.

1020
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,420
Okay!

1021
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,160
There should be...

1022
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,260
There should be another person in my lane too.

1023
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,300
Where are my friends?

1024
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,960
I thought I had friends too!

1025
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:03,700
Wait...

1026
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,420
Oh my God.

1027
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,560
Oh my God.

1028
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,900
And they're both flying characters.

1029
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:13,460
That's the worst.

1030
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:13,880
That's the worst part.

1031
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:14,160
Dude.

1032
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,320
I fucking hate all of you.

1033
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,120
Like...

1034
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
They're all flying characters too!

1035
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:28,940
This sucks!

1036
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,280
Everything I learned, it didn't mean anything.

1037
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,300
Oh my God.

1038
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:45,460
I'm just a lonely bird, trying to make it in this fucked up world.

1039
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,340
Alright, goodbye.

1040
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,500
I was left alone.

1041
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:55,920
Dad!

1042
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,420
Oh my gosh.

1043
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:06,340
Alright, I'm leaving this lane.

1044
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,100
You guys, good luck everybody.

1045
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:14,560
Good luck everybody, I'm fucking leaving this lane.

1046
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,600
I don't want to be in that lane no more.

1047
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:25,500
I don't want to be in this lane no more.

1048
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,300
I can't get anything done.

1049
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,720
I don't believe it.

1050
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,680
What do you want me to do?

1051
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,100
What do they want me to do?

1052
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,120
I'm just a poor fucking...

1053
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,840
I can't get that urn, man.

1054
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:45,800
There's... okay.

1055
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,460
I'm gonna...

1056
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:47,900
Alright.

1057
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,720
Oh my god, I swear to fucking god.

1058
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,120
You're such a bitch.

1059
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,660
Where did he go?

1060
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,680
Wait, where did he go?

1061
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,100
Where did the grandma go?

1062
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,000
Oh, thank god!

1063
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,560
Other people helped me.

1064
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,080
Oh my god, I actually have friends.

1065
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,380
That's fucking crazy.

1066
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,900
I actually have friends.

1067
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:18,320
I actually have friends now.

1068
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,800
I don't know how that... this is the first time.

1069
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:27,880
I don't wanna...

1070
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,780
Oh, what?

1071
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:29,800
Oh, fuck it.

1072
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,780
That's what the bird is.

1073
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:34,300
Okay, at least now I know what the bird is.

1074
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,800
Guys, I know it's like really rough right now watching me play.

1075
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,360
Like, I absolutely know.

1076
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,680
Don't worry.

1077
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:44,960
I know.

1078
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,740
Don't worry.

1079
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,080
I know.

1080
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,300
I'm trying my best.

1081
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,520
I'm trying my best.

1082
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:01,400
I'm just getting incredibly countered by people that can jump.

1083
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,200
Okay, jump has a long cooldown.

1084
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:09,820
Okay, that's good.

1085
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,460
Like, he's literally waiting for my jump too.

1086
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,100
Oh my god, I have a friend.

1087
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,380
Oh, thank you.

1088
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,060
Oh, thank you.

1089
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:19,460
That's all I wanted, a friend.

1090
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,340
Wait, did he die?

1091
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,020
Oh, shit.

1092
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,620
Oh, goodbye.

1093
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,500
That's like, wait a minute.

1094
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,520
You're not... you weren't there before.

1095
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,220
Three?

1096
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,060
Three?

1097
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:37,740
Okay.

1098
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,360
That's fine.

1099
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,840
Back to just following like...

1100
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,880
Just following this step-by-step guide.

1101
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,560
Okay.

1102
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,460
What do I...

1103
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,920
What do I do after this?

1104
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,400
Okay.

1105
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:51,860
One.

1106
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:52,760
One.

1107
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,480
Two.

1108
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,120
Oh.

1109
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:55,760
Two.

1110
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:56,680
Okay.

1111
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,260
Why can't we be friends?

1112
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,380
Why can't we be friends?

1113
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,980
Should have trusted your pink one as a boss.

1114
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,060
Like, gee boy.

1115
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,580
Thank you for the super chat.

1116
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,000
Thank you.

1117
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,320
Thank you.

1118
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,240
How would...

1119
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:10,840
How did I...

1120
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:15,720
How could I have known that I was going to get hard countered by literally...

1121
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:15,940
The...

1122
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:17,960
The two...

1123
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:22,160
The two characters that can do such big jumps.

1124
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,780
I fucking...

1125
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:25,300
That's right.

1126
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:25,740
I still...

1127
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:26,020
That...

1128
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,920
I know that's overkill, but I needed this.

1129
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:28,980
Like, I...

1130
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:31,540
I fucking needed that.

1131
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,140
You don't understand.

1132
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,000
I was so desperate.

1133
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,480
I...

1134
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:40,900
I...

1135
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:45,580
I had so much hate that I needed that.

1136
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:45,700
I...

1137
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:48,580
I swear to God...

1138
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,700
It was a mental win.

1139
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:51,880
Hehehe.

1140
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,060
Mentally, that was a win for me.

1141
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,300
You don't understand.

1142
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,020
Why do I shoot for this guy?

1143
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,780
This has been the furthest I've ever been to this one guy.

1144
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,540
What do I...

1145
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:03,960
Oh okay...

1146
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,440
I just shoot him.

1147
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:05,780
Okay.

1148
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:06,640
Push.

1149
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:08,080
Come on!

1150
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:09,900
Yeeeaaah!

1151
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,300
We did it, team!

1152
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:13,380
I don't...

1153
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:13,740
I'm fucking...

1154
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,700
I'm just going to upgrade all of this.

1155
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:15,600
Okay.

1156
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,840
We did it!

1157
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,780
This is what it feels like!

1158
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,380
This is what it feels like to have friends!

1159
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,640
Oh my god!

1160
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,280
This is what it feels like to have friends!

1161
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,040
Don't worry, I got you, bro!

1162
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,600
I- Sorry, I fucking left already.

1163
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,180
Oh my god.

1164
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,680
Jesus Christ.

1165
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:40,780
Please.

1166
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,500
I can't- I can't push in, I'm sorry.

1167
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:46,740
Look at them, they're so far away!

1168
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:53,400
I don't- Am I winning or am I- That is a very good question, by the way.

1169
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,080
Oh, he left!

1170
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:56,780
That's fine.

1171
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,100
That's absolutely fine.

1172
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:02,780
That- Oh, wait.

1173
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,120
We should all leave, actually.

1174
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,960
No, I should leave too.

1175
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,780
No, they're heading over.

1176
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:10,200
They're heading over.

1177
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:14,780
Holy shit.

1178
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:15,880
Alright.

1179
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,360
Oh, shit.

1180
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,100
Okay, goodbye.

1181
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,380
No, no, you're right.

1182
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,540
You're right.

1183
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,080
I'll- No, you're right.

1184
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,460
You guys can have that.

1185
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:32,240
You're- You guys- You guys can have that.

1186
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,040
I don't need it.

1187
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,300
I'll take this, though.

1188
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:37,340
I don't even know what- Oh, I'll take this too.

1189
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:39,300
Just take that.

1190
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,500
Get over here.

1191
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:46,680
Boom.

1192
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,240
Punch.

1193
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,400
Okay, now I'm punching this.

1194
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,120
I want money.

1195
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,580
I'm desperate.

1196
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,420
Give me my money.

1197
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,300
Give me my money.

1198
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,040
Nice.

1199
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,320
Yay!

1200
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,820
Oh, shit, I gotta help!

1201
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,500
Sorry, I was too busy farming.

1202
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,680
I felt like the main character for a sec.

1203
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,680
Sorry, I should help out now.

1204
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,620
He is jump!

1205
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:12,920
He is jump!

1206
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,140
You know what that means!

1207
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,620
That's fu- Oh, you bitch!

1208
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,040
Oh, you use jump too.

1209
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:21,920
That's fucking right!

1210
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:23,720
Yeah!

1211
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,420
That's fucking right, you whore!

1212
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,520
Oh my god, it's the best feeling in the world.

1213
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,200
This is really the...

1214
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:38,400
Wait, do you need help?

1215
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:41,900
Okay, I was like, I thought he was okay.

1216
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,520
Someone get ass!

1217
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,160
Oh my god, he used jump, guys!

1218
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,200
He actually used jump, guys!

1219
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,680
Holy shit!

1220
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:55,280
This is it!

1221
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:58,280
This is my character arc right here!

1222
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,340
Wait, did I not kill him?

1223
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,100
Baby, get down, baby!

1224
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,500
Get down!

1225
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:07,500
I need your money!

1226
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,180
I'm so behind anyway!

1227
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:12,840
Oh shit!

1228
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,100
Oh, this is what it feels like!

1229
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,040
Where's the shop?

1230
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:18,420
Where's the shop?

1231
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:20,640
I don't know where I have...

1232
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,900
Oh no, the shop's closed!

1233
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:26,260
Okay.

1234
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:28,960
Wait, did somebody die?

1235
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:29,600
Who died?

1236
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,240
Where the fuck is the shop?

1237
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,580
Where is the shop?

1238
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:38,400
Why'd they go back to base?

1239
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:39,780
Okay, well...

1240
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:40,920
Sorry.

1241
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:42,680
I'm new around here.

1242
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,620
To the base I go.

1243
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:45,660
You know what?

1244
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,540
Fuck it.

1245
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,500
This is a pub anyway.

1246
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,980
Your heavy melee gives you 100% bonus.

1247
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:52,440
You don't need to suffer reloading.

1248
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,740
Oh yeah, I keep forgetting.

1249
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:55,740
Alright.

1250
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,040
Now off I go.

1251
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,360
Do I know what I bought?

1252
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,200
That's a good question.

1253
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:07,020
Oh, you don't jump!

1254
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:08,480
I'm heading over to you.

1255
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:10,360
I'm heading over!

1256
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:11,900
I know you don't jump!

1257
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:15,140
Oh!

1258
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:16,980
You think I'm...

1259
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,700
Oh, you think I'm scared of you?

1260
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:20,460
That's fucking right.

1261
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,040
That's fucking right!

1262
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:25,620
Oh!

1263
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:28,980
Wait, where did you go?

1264
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,660
Oh, you think you can run?

1265
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,520
Oh shit, you can.

1266
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:44,130
You can't jump!

1267
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:45,850
You can't jump!

1268
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:48,770
That's a key, right?

1269
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:52,570
I fucking know that you can't jump too!

1270
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:54,310
Oh, hey.

1271
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:55,850
You're coming over.

1272
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:55,930
You're coming over.

1273
00:45:58,510 --> 00:45:59,370
Oh shit.

1274
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:02,030
Wait.

1275
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,400
Oh.

1276
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,180
Oh, my god, no!

1277
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:13,860
What the fuck is that damage!?

1278
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:15,540
Holy shit!

1279
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,480
I even charged her!

1280
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,880
Oh, my God!

1281
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:23,360
Holy shit!

1282
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,500
That didn't matter!

1283
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,240
Her damage was insane!

1284
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:36,180
She has 28k souls?

1285
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,160
Okay.

1286
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:38,940
Oh, destroy item.

1287
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,200
Oh, I have this.

1288
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,500
Holy shit, who the fuck fit?

1289
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,480
Oh my god, now she has 29k!

1290
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:51,860
I was not paying attention to where the fuck was that.

1291
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,000
I was just like, holy shit.

1292
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,760
Wait, this guy.

1293
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,360
How can you be bad at Infernus?

1294
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:01,980
Isn't he like one of the most OP characters?

1295
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:02,820
How?

1296
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:03,340
How?

1297
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:04,340
Okay.

1298
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,540
Anyway, don't be mad.

1299
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,840
It's Aves.

1300
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:11,820
She's the only problem.

1301
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:13,780
This guy.

1302
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:16,960
Okay, things make more sense now.

1303
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,200
Alright.

1304
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,440
Maybe I can... guys, maybe I can catch up.

1305
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:23,260
Guys.

1306
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,840
Guys, maybe I can catch up.

1307
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:28,720
Guys, if I farm these guys, maybe I can catch up.

1308
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:30,960
Maybe.

1309
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,800
Maybe I can catch up with the babies.

1310
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:35,520
Guys, maybe.

1311
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,840
Guys, it could be possible.

1312
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:39,320
It could be possible.

1313
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:42,460
No.

1314
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:43,920
Guys, it could be possible.

1315
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:44,740
You don't know that.

1316
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:48,600
You don't know that.

1317
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:50,980
Like, right here.

1318
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,400
It could be possible, guys.

1319
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:58,820
Oh my god, again?

1320
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:02,840
Whoa.

1321
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:07,740
He doesn't know.

1322
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,160
He doesn't know.

1323
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,280
Oh shit, I should leave.

1324
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:20,040
My teammate left, so I was like, okay, hey guys, I'm back.

1325
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,940
I was like, there's four people.

1326
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,340
I leave now.

1327
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:31,380
I leave.

1328
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:34,860
The hit and run.

1329
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:36,680
The hit and run special.

1330
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,760
As long as the haze is not near me.

1331
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:39,780
I have 40k.

1332
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,880
I don't know how to farm.

1333
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:45,480
I don't know how to farm properly.

1334
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:51,500
That is...

1335
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:53,920
Okay.

1336
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:56,600
Guys, I don't know.

1337
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:59,040
Is it obvious that I don't know what I'm doing?

1338
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:00,240
I don't think so, right?

1339
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:00,980
I don't...

1340
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:07,300
Like, even though I'm like, you know, very behind.

1341
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:08,960
Oh shit!

1342
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,000
Don't worry, I'm coming over!

1343
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,920
Oh shit, nevermind!

1344
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:16,220
Whoo!

1345
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:17,860
I... I'm here now.

1346
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:22,060
I'm here to assist.

1347
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,100
Boom, there we go.

1348
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,060
She's so low.

1349
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:28,560
I helped.

1350
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:29,580
I helped!

1351
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:31,940
Yay!

1352
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:35,620
I'm helping.

1353
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,320
I'm doing it.

1354
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,760
Oh wait, I cancelled her ult!

1355
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:43,560
Yeah, I knew what I was doing.

1356
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,960
I... I definitely knew what I was doing.

1357
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:51,460
Guys.

1358
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,880
I definitely was intentional.

1359
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,360
So intentional.

1360
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:01,460
Shit, I'm just a gamer.

1361
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,820
I'm just a fucking gamer.

1362
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:04,680
What can I say?

1363
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,080
What can I fucking say?

1364
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,340
What do I do now?

1365
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:14,560
Oh my god, she used jump!

1366
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,160
I know you used jump!

1367
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:18,640
Fucking do it!

1368
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:19,580
Wait, where did you go?

1369
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:20,840
Where did she go?

1370
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,700
Oh, that's fucking right!

1371
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:26,180
Get punched!

1372
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,040
Get punched!

1373
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,260
Okay, I'm fucking leaving.

1374
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:35,840
No!

1375
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:37,820
No!

1376
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:43,280
It's okay.

1377
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,300
We're fine.

1378
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,080
We're so healthy.

1379
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:49,520
We're so healthy.

1380
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:52,520
We're so healthy, guys.

1381
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:53,980
We're okay.

1382
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,140
Okay, all our teammates dying.

1383
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:57,920
But that's okay.

1384
00:50:57,980 --> 00:50:59,400
I'm fucking getting rid of these guys though.

1385
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,080
Oh god.

1386
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:04,220
Oh, no!

1387
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:04,700
Bebop!

1388
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:05,160
No!

1389
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:06,340
Bebop!

1390
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:08,740
Bebop!

1391
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:12,430
I'm sorry!

1392
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:15,350
Bebop!

1393
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:20,290
It's okay.

1394
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:21,130
I lived though.

1395
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:23,410
I will avenge you, Bebop!

1396
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:25,170
I will...

1397
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:27,410
I will avenge you.

1398
00:51:27,810 --> 00:51:28,970
I am poor?

1399
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:31,510
Oh wait, I'm not at the shop.

1400
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:33,330
It's like, what?

1401
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:35,530
Of everything I find?

1402
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:37,830
Okay, there you go.

1403
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:41,830
I'm not even at the shop.

1404
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:43,190
And I thought I was poor.

1405
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:44,490
I was confused.

1406
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:47,470
I was so confused.

1407
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:49,610
But I have to go in order!

1408
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:52,730
Oh, you're right.

1409
00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:53,830
I'll upgrade my ult.

1410
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:54,990
Okay.

1411
00:51:57,550 --> 00:51:58,270
Go up.

1412
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:00,110
There we go.

1413
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:04,970
Oh, maybe I'll grab... get stuff.

1414
00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:05,490
Oh, yeah.

1415
00:52:05,570 --> 00:52:05,990
I knew it.

1416
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,040
That's fucking right!

1417
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:13,760
Yeah!

1418
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:14,920
Let's go, buddy!

1419
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:16,360
Let's go!

1420
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:21,860
That's right.

1421
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:23,000
Teamwork!

1422
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:27,840
Guys, I still...

1423
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,240
I don't know if you guys know this, but I still...

1424
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,700
I still don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

1425
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:34,820
Oh, shit!

1426
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:37,940
Don't make me use this.

1427
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:40,460
Oh, shit!

1428
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:43,700
That's fine.

1429
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:44,400
I helped out.

1430
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:45,820
Don't worry.

1431
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:46,540
I got you, bro.

1432
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:48,120
I got you.

1433
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:49,700
I got you.

1434
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:50,300
I got you.

1435
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:52,280
Don't worry.

1436
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:55,380
Oh, that's your ult, right?

1437
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:56,740
Yeah, that's your ult.

1438
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:57,500
I'm fucking...

1439
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,840
Oh, my God!

1440
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:02,220
What the fu...

1441
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,300
Guys!

1442
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:06,240
What the fuck happened there?

1443
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:08,100
Holy sh...

1444
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:09,000

1445
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:09,740
See ya.

1446
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:10,700
See...

1447
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:13,380
Run!

1448
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,640
I couldn't cancel!

1449
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,060
She was... You saw her?

1450
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,420
You saw what the fuck she just did?

1451
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:22,460
I was like, bye!

1452
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:25,300
Oh, yeah.

1453
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:27,120
I heard the duration extender is really good.

1454
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:31,460
Maybe I can grab some extra.

1455
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:32,520
Here.

1456
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:35,900
I need this so bad.

1457
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:37,360
Oh, hey, maybe?

1458
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:37,800
No.

1459
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:38,820
Alright.

1460
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,300
Yeah, I saw that.

1461
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,060
That was scary as fuck.

1462
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:46,840
Oh, did they kill her?

1463
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,720
No, they killed us.

1464
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:50,860
Okay, I should help out.

1465
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,120
I'm a little lost.

1466
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:53,280
Bebop!

1467
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:58,560
Bebop, come back!

1468
00:54:03,890 --> 00:54:04,570
Bebop!

1469
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:09,470
You can't run forever, bitch!

1470
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:12,930
That's fucking right!

1471
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:17,670
You can't fucking run forever!

1472
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:23,410
You thought you could get away?

1473
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:25,790
You thought you could get away?

1474
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:26,290
You thought you could get away?

1475
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:27,890
I will fucking punch your ass!

1476
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:29,090
I will fucking punch your ass!

1477
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:30,950
I will learn to fear seven.

1478
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:33,650
Where are they?

1479
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:36,310
Where are they?

1480
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:36,610
Where is she?

1481
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:38,730
Oh, you're over here.

1482
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:40,150
You're over here.

1483
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:41,110
I see your...

1484
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:42,950
I see your ass right now.

1485
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:44,790
Who is he trying to fight?

1486
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:47,530
Oh, her!

1487
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:48,270
Okay.

1488
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:51,130
That's...

1489
00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:52,070
Oh shit!

1490
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:52,470
Okay.

1491
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:55,490
Oh my god!

1492
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:57,230
Okay, she is fucking...

1493
00:54:57,230 --> 00:54:58,230
I'm outta here.

1494
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:01,390
You win this.

1495
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:03,610
Goodbye.

1496
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:05,290
I'm fucking outta here.

1497
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:07,090
They're afraid.

1498
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:10,370
Yeah, I can tell.

1499
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:12,470
I can tell they're fucking afraid.

1500
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:14,730
Holy shit.

1501
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:17,090
They like ran away so fast.

1502
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:18,490
I was like...

1503
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:20,090
I saw them running and I was like...

1504
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:20,790
Oh, I know why.

1505
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:26,950
Now I know why they were running.

1506
00:55:29,570 --> 00:55:30,250
Let's see.

1507
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:31,150
Oh, it's grandma.

1508
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:32,430
Or grandpa.

1509
00:55:33,850 --> 00:55:34,950
What the fuck?

1510
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:38,390
You fucker.

1511
00:55:38,410 --> 00:55:40,150
You're an actual fucker.

1512
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:41,790
You're an actual fucker.

1513
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:42,330
I see you.

1514
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:45,310
I fucking see...

1515
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:45,950
Where did he go?

1516
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:48,690
That's fucking right.

1517
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:49,550
I'm fucking heading over here.

1518
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:50,290
You think I won't?

1519
00:55:52,170 --> 00:55:53,290
You think I won't?

1520
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:54,250
I see you.

1521
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:56,110
Okay, I lost him.

1522
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:57,830
I don't see him anymore.

1523
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:01,050
Oh my god!

1524
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:03,050
I wanna get this guy so badly!

1525
00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:06,970
Rage quit on me.

1526
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:08,010
They lost to his!

1527
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:09,050
Let's fucking go!

1528
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:12,990
I am no longer afraid.

1529
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:14,330
I...

1530
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:18,130
They lost to his.

1531
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:21,610
No longer shall I fear you.

1532
00:56:22,290 --> 00:56:23,910
That's fucking right.

1533
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:24,950
That's fucking right.

1534
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:27,290
You think I fear you now?

1535
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:30,930
You think I fear you now?

1536
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:33,030
No longer shall I be afraid.

1537
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:34,430
No longer shall I be afraid.

1538
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:37,250
No longer shall I be afraid.

1539
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:37,990
That's right.

1540
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:39,010
I'm heading over.

1541
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:41,310
I'm heading over.

1542
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:45,410
That's fucking right.

1543
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:48,450
That's fucking...

1544
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:50,070
Oh yeah, you know I'm heading over.

1545
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:52,430
You know I'm heading over!

1546
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:55,350
I'm fucking right here at your door!

1547
00:56:55,470 --> 00:56:56,670
Knock knock, baby!

1548
00:56:57,230 --> 00:56:58,330
Knock knock!

1549
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:03,970
Knock knock!

1550
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:06,730
Oh!

1551
00:57:08,350 --> 00:57:09,450
Okay, that was...

1552
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:10,610
That's awkward.

1553
00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:12,670
Guys?

1554
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:13,730
Guys?

1555
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:16,030
Where's my team?

1556
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:17,870
Okay, guys, I'm back.

1557
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:19,870
Guys, I'm back to the fight.

1558
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:21,570
I was just waiting for you guys.

1559
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:22,110
I distracted.

1560
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:24,050
You're welcome.

1561
00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:27,050
I was the opener.

1562
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:29,730
Guys, I was literally the opener.

1563
00:57:33,390 --> 00:57:34,510
I opened it.

1564
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:35,750
I initiated, guys.

1565
00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:36,770
I initiated.

1566
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:37,930
Yay!

1567
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:42,330
Look at that.

1568
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:45,050
I'm so fucking good.

1569
00:57:46,310 --> 00:57:47,930
She did that.

1570
00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:49,550
Just a distraction.

1571
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:52,570
Alright.

1572
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:54,410
Yeah, that was...

1573
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:57,810
Yeah, that was bottom fragger.

1574
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:00,270
That seems right.

1575
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:02,370
That seems right.

1576
00:58:03,410 --> 00:58:04,090
Yeah.

1577
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:05,530
Jesus Christ.

1578
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,530
49,000?

1579
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:08,530
Yeah.

1580
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:13,390
I did my best.

1581
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:14,870
I did it.

1582
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:20,050
Yeah, I don't have 9 deaths at least.

1583
00:58:20,350 --> 00:58:21,170
But not...

1584
00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:23,750
Yeah, bottom damage, but not bottom frag.

1585
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:24,710
That's true.

1586
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:25,750
That's true.

1587
00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:30,350
Come on and slam and welcome to the jam.

1588
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:32,230
Thank you for the super chat.

1589
00:58:32,370 --> 00:58:33,010
Thank you, thank you.

1590
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:34,110
Oh, positive KDA.

1591
00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:36,110
Positive KDA.

1592
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:37,670
I'm learning.

1593
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:40,150
At least I'm learning.

1594
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:45,600
Alright.

1595
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:48,180
First win of the day.

1596
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:48,740
Let's go.

1597
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:52,560
Yay!

1598
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,480
Positive KDA.

1599
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:58,060
Anyway, so that's Abram.

1600
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,300
Apparently the...

1601
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:03,780
One of the easiest characters to play.

1602
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:05,620
Because, um...

1603
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:07,240
You know, all he does is punch.

1604
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:08,680
Alright.

1605
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,520
I wanna actually try the sniper lady.

1606
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,380
The sniper lady seems really fun.

1607
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,420
But like, I need to figure out what her build is.

1608
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:17,420
Um...

1609
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:20,080
I was told that she has like this really...

1610
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,580
She has either...

1611
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:24,180
You either do speed build or...

1612
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:26,360
Um...

1613
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:27,320
Um...

1614
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:30,780
A speed build or a spirit build.

1615
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:32,100
Whatever the fuck that means.

1616
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:33,380
Whatever.

1617
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:35,900
Whatever the fuck that means.

1618
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:37,500
It's either speed or power.

1619
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:38,780
But I don't know which one.

1620
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:41,980
Sniper TP has sexy feet build.

1621
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:42,460
Okay.

1622
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:47,380
Oh, is that the build?

1623
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:49,600
Is that what it... Is that the feet?

1624
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:52,540
Okay, like the fast build is so funny.

1625
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:53,680
Not gonna lie.

1626
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:54,660
Which one is it?

1627
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:55,460
Is it this one?

1628
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:57,480
Is it...

1629
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:58,240
Oh my god.

1630
00:59:58,260 --> 00:59:59,220
I'm sorry.

1631
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:00,960
I didn't see the full name.

1632
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,260
Is it this one?

1633
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:04,780
Sorry.

1634
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:08,520
Is it?

1635
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:12,400
Okay, so apparently this makes you go incredibly fast.

1636
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:16,420
Early farm lane until max ult and then put...

1637
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:20,900
I don't know.

1638
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:21,700
Which one is...

1639
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:25,680
Okay, improved build versus a lot works like...

1640
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,240
Which one is the fast build?

1641
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:28,300
Which one is it?

1642
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:29,500
I want the fast one.

1643
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:33,620
Because I don't know which one is the super fast incredible feet DPS.

1644
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:34,220
Okay.

1645
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:37,280
Incredible feet D... Oh my god.

1646
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:38,160
This is so dumb.

1647
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:39,340
Incredible...

1648
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:42,920
It's not it!

1649
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:43,940
That's not it!

1650
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:46,020
Okay.

1651
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:47,420
Wait.

1652
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:47,920
Oh, wait.

1653
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:49,020
There you go.

1654
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:50,520
Okay.

1655
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:53,040
What is it called?

1656
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:54,160
Incredible...

1657
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:00,380
Is it actually?

1658
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:01,300
Okay.

1659
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:02,800
Guys, which one is it?

1660
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:05,640
Uh...

1661
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:10,580
I wanna be super fast!

1662
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:12,660
That's all I wanna be!

1663
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:14,220
Okay.

1664
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:15,640
Sexy movement.

1665
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:18,480
Is it this one?

1666
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:21,520
The boring...

1667
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:24,240
The boring part.

1668
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:26,460
Damn.

1669
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:27,440
Okay.

1670
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:28,060
Okay.

1671
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:29,220
Flex.

1672
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:30,060
Okay.

1673
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:30,540
Wait.

1674
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:31,400
But I need like...

1675
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,220
Um... Why is it...

1676
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:35,580
Because it's all... You're super fast!

1677
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:36,180
That's why!

1678
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:37,200
That's literally it!

1679
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:39,140
You're just so fucking fast!

1680
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:40,860
That's literally it!

1681
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:43,040
I wonder if this one is...

1682
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:46,500
I don't know which one it is!

1683
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:47,640
Which one is it?

1684
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,320
There's so many feet builds!

1685
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:52,500
Which one is the right one?

1686
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,420
Which one is the right build?

1687
01:01:57,860 --> 01:01:59,200
There's so many!

1688
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:00,820
Oh!

1689
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:02,360
It's been nerfed!

1690
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:02,740
Alright.

1691
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:03,420
Nevermind.

1692
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:04,760
I guess I'll use this.

1693
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,720
Apparently they nerfed it.

1694
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:07,820
They...

1695
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:13,460
I guess we'll just... We'll just do this.

1696
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:16,420
We'll just do whatever is the first one.

1697
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:18,000
Um...

1698
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,760
Just go with the most popular one.

1699
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:21,660
Enduring speed?

1700
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:23,500
Why does it say enduring speed?

1701
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:24,700
Lucky shot.

1702
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:26,340
Uh...

1703
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,260
First fire.

1704
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:29,180
Where's enduring speed?

1705
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:31,120
There's have a lot.

1706
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:31,340
Oh!

1707
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:31,820
There it is!

1708
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:32,440
Enduring speed.

1709
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:32,700
Okay.

1710
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:33,640
We'll just do this.

1711
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:35,380
The most boring name one.

1712
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:36,660
Um...

1713
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:38,480
The most boring name one.

1714
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:40,560
The spirit one I heard was really good too.

1715
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:41,940
Cause I was like... Okay.

1716
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:45,020
So basically...

1717
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:46,580
Yes.

1718
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:47,780
Pew pew pew pew pew pew.

1719
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:49,440
See I told you guys.

1720
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:52,100
I told you the noobs don't know how to parry.

1721
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:53,460
Cause I don't even parry.

1722
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:57,440
They don't know how to parry.

1723
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:58,320
I told you guys.

1724
01:02:59,200 --> 01:02:59,960
But no.

1725
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:00,280
No.

1726
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:03,500
The 10 to 15 minutes of the lane part.

1727
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:04,400
Oh my god.

1728
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:05,520
I fucking wanna die.

1729
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:07,460
Like doing the lane part.

1730
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:08,280
I...

1731
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:12,960
That part like actually just pisses me off so much.

1732
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,560
I'm just like... Please.

1733
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:17,300
Get me out of the lane.

1734
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:18,220
Like...

1735
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:19,640
Please.

1736
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:22,580
I hate...

1737
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:24,720
I hate it here so much.

1738
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:25,660
Okay.

1739
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:28,000
We gotta get the tether...

1740
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:32,400
Let's say any movement is restricted to the... Oh!

1741
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:34,160
This is like the Ash Q.

1742
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:39,240
Ash Q and then Crow and then Flight.

1743
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:41,180
And then Fly in the air and then Sniper.

1744
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:41,540
Okay.

1745
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:46,080
I was going insane into...

1746
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:48,000
No you don't.

1747
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:50,020
I was gonna go fucking crazy.

1748
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:55,280
Also, is Sound Guy here?

1749
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:56,400
How's the sound been?

1750
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:58,100
I hope the sound hasn't been too loud.

1751
01:03:58,340 --> 01:03:58,820
Chat.

1752
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:02,760
I hope it hasn't been too loud, guys.

1753
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,380
Make high priority.

1754
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:06,820
Oh!

1755
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:07,360
Okay.

1756
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,420
You said it was good?

1757
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:13,820
Okay.

1758
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:14,480
That's good.

1759
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:19,480
As long as you guys thought it was... I didn't see I was too busy going crazy in the lane.

1760
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:20,560
But like...

1761
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:22,940
negative connotation.

1762
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:25,680
Alright.

1763
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:28,820
Okay.

1764
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:29,080
Oh!

1765
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,380
Violet's first prio?

1766
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:30,820
Okay.

1767
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:31,540
Here we go.

1768
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:33,740
Wait.

1769
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:35,100
Is her name... I wish...

1770
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:38,340
I just... The only thing I don't like about the character design is that...

1771
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:42,920
I know it's supposed to fit the environment but the color is so dull.

1772
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:44,640
I'm not a fan of that.

1773
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:46,080
Oh!

1774
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:46,540
Thank god.

1775
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:46,820
Okay.

1776
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,840
I'm not... I'm not Abrum.

1777
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,120
So I'm fine with laning against you.

1778
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:51,780
I'm fine...

1779
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,720
I'm fine with laning against you.

1780
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:56,360
I'm not...

1781
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:58,980
I'm not Abrum anymore.

1782
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:00,280
So it's okay.

1783
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:05,660
I just don't like how dull the colors are.

1784
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:07,360
It just doesn't...

1785
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:07,920
I don't know.

1786
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,300
I need sparkly colors.

1787
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:10,600
I need bright colors.

1788
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:13,280
Uh...

1789
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:14,500
No, I meant the characters.

1790
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:16,700
I feel like the characters are like...

1791
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:18,260
Colors seem very...

1792
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:19,980
dull in general.

1793
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:22,200
There's no brightly colored characters at all.

1794
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:25,940
But I guess because you want them to be able to be able to hide and stuff.

1795
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:27,280
You don't want to be able to be seen.

1796
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:28,480
Uh...

1797
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:29,700
Yeah, it's so muted.

1798
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:30,120
Yeah.

1799
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:32,320
It's so muted.

1800
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:34,200
In general.

1801
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,560
Uh... John, thank you for the super chat.

1802
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:36,880
Thank you.

1803
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:37,280
Thank you.

1804
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:38,860
Congratulations on your first win.

1805
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:40,340
Welcome to the Deadlock experience.

1806
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:46,180
Not gonna lie, that game we had today had to be the most fun I've had playing Deadlock.

1807
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:47,080
Like...

1808
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:54,440
Despite how fucking tilting playing against this fucker was as Abrum, um... the moment, like...

1809
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:55,400
She didn't jump.

1810
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:56,480
It was so easy.

1811
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:57,200
It was...

1812
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:02,020
The moment he couldn't...

1813
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:04,380
The moment I broke his fucking shins.

1814
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:08,880
Like... The moment I broke this grandpa's ankles, it was over for him.

1815
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:10,460
It was so fucking over.

1816
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:20,040
Grandpa was fucking dead.

1817
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:21,780
Imma break your fucking ankles.

1818
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:24,880
Alright.

1819
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:26,880
Anyway.

1820
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:29,680
I swear to god.

1821
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:33,560
I can't believe my lane had all the characters that fucking countered me.

1822
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:34,540
That was so tilting.

1823
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,940
That was so tilting.

1824
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:38,080
I was like, are you serious?

1825
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:40,240
You can fucking jump?

1826
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:42,280
Like, fuck off!

1827
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:43,960
Go to a different lane!

1828
01:06:45,220 --> 01:06:45,740
Go...

1829
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:47,980
Yay!

1830
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:50,360
No, people were pausing the game, I think.

1831
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:51,520
Yay!

1832
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:53,540
Oh, I don't have shoes.

1833
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:54,080
No wonder.

1834
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:55,780
Oh no, she's the jury.

1835
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:57,120
She's the jury.

1836
01:06:57,140 --> 01:06:59,620
She's the jury of deadlock.

1837
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:03,820
The one ult where they both flew away.

1838
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:04,320
Oh god.

1839
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:05,600
That's...

1840
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,460
That hurt my soul.

1841
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:12,300
Alright, this is Kovacs simulator now.

1842
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:14,800
Guys, are you guys ready for Kovacs simulator?

1843
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:16,800
I'm so ready.

1844
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:20,080
I'm so ready to Kovacs.

1845
01:07:23,470 --> 01:07:25,090
How much ammo do I have?

1846
01:07:26,970 --> 01:07:29,430
Okay, I should reload before I shoot this one guy.

1847
01:07:33,970 --> 01:07:35,350
Do I need to?

1848
01:07:35,450 --> 01:07:37,090
Oh, I don't even need to aim down sight.

1849
01:07:37,350 --> 01:07:37,890
What the fuck?

1850
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:40,670
Aiming down sight is for fucking pussies.

1851
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:41,810
I can...

1852
01:07:41,810 --> 01:07:43,350
Okay, except for Kovac moment.

1853
01:07:46,410 --> 01:07:46,930
Early...

1854
01:07:49,150 --> 01:07:50,190
Get over here.

1855
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:52,490
Get your ass over here, grandpa.

1856
01:07:52,490 --> 01:07:52,650
Grandpa.

1857
01:07:55,470 --> 01:07:56,630
That's fucking right.

1858
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:02,370
Oh, our guy already killed somebody?

1859
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:03,050
Nice.

1860
01:08:03,990 --> 01:08:05,210
I fucking knew it.

1861
01:08:08,010 --> 01:08:08,830
Alright, nice.

1862
01:08:08,850 --> 01:08:09,170
It's fine.

1863
01:08:10,210 --> 01:08:11,710
Am I solo laning again?

1864
01:08:11,870 --> 01:08:12,470
Oh, I am.

1865
01:08:12,690 --> 01:08:13,550
Oh, god damn it.

1866
01:08:13,570 --> 01:08:13,850
I am.

1867
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:17,130
I am solo laning.

1868
01:08:18,130 --> 01:08:18,870
It's fine.

1869
01:08:19,030 --> 01:08:20,230
I don't need help.

1870
01:08:20,230 --> 01:08:23,410
If I didn't need help as Abram, I don't need help now.

1871
01:08:25,170 --> 01:08:26,670
I don't need help now, guys.

1872
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:28,870
I'm perfectly fine solo laning.

1873
01:08:31,230 --> 01:08:32,130
Guys, it's okay.

1874
01:08:34,730 --> 01:08:35,770
It's okay, guys.

1875
01:08:39,790 --> 01:08:41,450
Oh, you missed, you fucker.

1876
01:08:42,090 --> 01:08:42,970
That's fucking rude.

1877
01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:44,290
You think you can hide from me?

1878
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:45,390
Guys, sorry.

1879
01:08:45,450 --> 01:08:45,830
I have to reload.

1880
01:08:45,990 --> 01:08:47,150
You can because I have to reload.

1881
01:08:47,370 --> 01:08:49,930
You think because you're in the air I'm scared?

1882
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:53,390
Bro, this is like Duck Hunt.

1883
01:08:53,870 --> 01:08:56,370
Oh, you can't shoot when I saw it.

1884
01:08:56,450 --> 01:08:57,670
Yeah, that's fucking right.

1885
01:09:00,330 --> 01:09:02,890
You can't aim for shit, grandpa.

1886
01:09:04,590 --> 01:09:05,850
That's fucking right.

1887
01:09:07,070 --> 01:09:08,730
You're fucking so bad.

1888
01:09:09,670 --> 01:09:10,930
Oh, my god.

1889
01:09:10,970 --> 01:09:12,110
You're so bad.

1890
01:09:15,090 --> 01:09:16,730
Oh, my god.

1891
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:17,690
You're so...

1892
01:09:17,690 --> 01:09:21,090
Congratulations on hitting your first shot, bro.

1893
01:09:21,710 --> 01:09:23,190
Actually, congratulations.

1894
01:09:26,610 --> 01:09:27,970
Holy shit.

1895
01:09:28,070 --> 01:09:31,710
Learn how to shoot better before you fucking contest me.

1896
01:09:35,610 --> 01:09:38,850
Oh, you're scared, aren't you?

1897
01:09:41,470 --> 01:09:42,850
I'm gonna go bye.

1898
01:09:43,150 --> 01:09:44,430
You might as well.

1899
01:09:45,690 --> 01:09:47,670
Bro, this guy can't aim.

1900
01:09:47,890 --> 01:09:50,330
He literally can't aim.

1901
01:09:50,330 --> 01:09:51,190
It's so sad.

1902
01:09:52,510 --> 01:09:54,350
Alright, I'm coming over, grandpa.

1903
01:09:56,310 --> 01:09:57,770
I'm coming over, grandpa.

1904
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:02,410
I'm heading back, grandpa.

1905
01:10:02,670 --> 01:10:03,230
That's right.

1906
01:10:06,530 --> 01:10:07,410
Oh, shit.

1907
01:10:07,530 --> 01:10:08,890
Oh, you think I'm scared?

1908
01:10:09,570 --> 01:10:10,250
Oh, shit.

1909
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:10,790
Wait, I am.

1910
01:10:10,830 --> 01:10:11,670
Wait, what the fuck?

1911
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:13,150
He doesn't do single shot anymore.

1912
01:10:14,190 --> 01:10:15,450
What did he buy?

1913
01:10:17,970 --> 01:10:19,050
What did you buy?

1914
01:10:19,050 --> 01:10:20,230
How does he do that?

1915
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:24,610
What did he buy?

1916
01:10:26,470 --> 01:10:27,990
He does spread shot.

1917
01:10:28,110 --> 01:10:28,990
What a cheater.

1918
01:10:30,330 --> 01:10:32,670
Actually cheating because he can't aim.

1919
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:35,610
So now he has to do a spread shot to actually do things.

1920
01:10:40,610 --> 01:10:41,650
Jesus Christ.

1921
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:43,210
Yeah, now he has to fucking cheat.

1922
01:10:45,770 --> 01:10:46,950
Oh my god.

1923
01:10:47,230 --> 01:10:47,750
Hacks.

1924
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:53,270
Oh my god.

1925
01:10:54,110 --> 01:10:54,710
Oh my god.

1926
01:10:54,710 --> 01:10:57,290
Just cause you have spread shot doesn't mean you're good.

1927
01:10:58,230 --> 01:10:58,710
Alright.

1928
01:10:59,290 --> 01:11:00,870
I wanna use this right now.

1929
01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:02,430
Just cause I want to.

1930
01:11:02,870 --> 01:11:04,170
I have plenty of time.

1931
01:11:07,450 --> 01:11:10,350
I wanna use my abilities but I don't think I'm gonna hit that though.

1932
01:11:10,770 --> 01:11:11,990
That's why I haven't used it.

1933
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:18,440
Okay, there we go.

1934
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,240
Oh, you're gonna run?

1935
01:11:22,740 --> 01:11:24,020
You're gonna run now?

1936
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:25,260
Fucking bitch.

1937
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:29,820
That's looking right.

1938
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,040
Oh, you're gonna jump you fucker.

1939
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:35,000
You fucker.

1940
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:38,340
I can't afford it yet.

1941
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:40,960
Okay.

1942
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:43,760
I can't afford this.

1943
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:45,000
I don't know what to get first.

1944
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,260
I'm going crazy again.

1945
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:50,520
I'm actually gonna go crazy here again.

1946
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:58,760
I'm gonna fucking...

1947
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:00,820
We're back here again.

1948
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:03,180
We're actually back here.

1949
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:07,920
Oh my god.

1950
01:12:14,870 --> 01:12:15,790
Oh my god.

1951
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:16,910
I think I dodged that?

1952
01:12:17,030 --> 01:12:17,510
No, I didn't.

1953
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:19,930
That's right.

1954
01:12:19,970 --> 01:12:21,170
You thought you could trap me?

1955
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:22,010
I see you.

1956
01:12:22,290 --> 01:12:23,830
I fucking see you.

1957
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:27,410
I like how it's always like crew is kinda hard to hit and then I hit it.

1958
01:12:31,830 --> 01:12:33,150
Oh, he's so low.

1959
01:12:33,370 --> 01:12:34,630
He's so low.

1960
01:12:44,230 --> 01:12:45,130
Swear to god.

1961
01:12:46,530 --> 01:12:47,050
Please.

1962
01:12:47,110 --> 01:12:47,850
I need my ult.

1963
01:12:47,990 --> 01:12:49,770
I need my fucking ult at this point.

1964
01:12:51,290 --> 01:12:51,990
That's right.

1965
01:12:52,090 --> 01:12:53,010
Don't get near me.

1966
01:12:53,230 --> 01:12:55,050
Don't you get near me, bitch.

1967
01:12:55,330 --> 01:12:58,130
You're literally out aiming.

1968
01:12:58,390 --> 01:13:04,650
The only way he fucking shoots hits me is if...

1969
01:13:05,930 --> 01:13:10,450
Literally the only way he hits me is if he does that spread shot.

1970
01:13:12,810 --> 01:13:13,650
Oh no.

1971
01:13:13,990 --> 01:13:14,810
This is bad.

1972
01:13:14,830 --> 01:13:15,110
This is bad.

1973
01:13:15,130 --> 01:13:15,930
This is actually bad.

1974
01:13:16,070 --> 01:13:17,010
Holy shit.

1975
01:13:17,070 --> 01:13:17,530
No.

1976
01:13:18,390 --> 01:13:18,910
No!

1977
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:21,850
That spread shot!

1978
01:13:25,310 --> 01:13:27,630
He got the spread shot!

1979
01:13:31,050 --> 01:13:31,990
Don't worry.

1980
01:13:32,970 --> 01:13:34,770
You're gonna lose out because...

1981
01:13:34,770 --> 01:13:37,030
How did he... Oh my... I've not been farming.

1982
01:13:37,210 --> 01:13:38,310
I just realized, guys.

1983
01:13:38,570 --> 01:13:38,770
Alright.

1984
01:13:38,930 --> 01:13:39,750
It's time to farm.

1985
01:13:40,230 --> 01:13:42,370
I don't know the farming shit.

1986
01:13:42,470 --> 01:13:45,070
The farming shit is what throws me off every time.

1987
01:13:47,730 --> 01:13:49,890
He out farmed me.

1988
01:13:50,170 --> 01:13:51,350
I'm so sad.

1989
01:13:51,870 --> 01:13:52,930
Alright, guys.

1990
01:13:52,990 --> 01:13:54,150
It's time for farm.

1991
01:13:55,910 --> 01:13:57,110
I need this.

1992
01:13:57,550 --> 01:13:58,870
I need this.

1993
01:13:59,150 --> 01:14:00,410
I need this.

1994
01:14:02,690 --> 01:14:04,270
I need a farm.

1995
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:05,670
I'm so fucking poor.

1996
01:14:05,910 --> 01:14:07,710
I'm so fucking poor.

1997
01:14:08,650 --> 01:14:10,810
I'm so fucking poor.

1998
01:14:12,970 --> 01:14:15,310
Give me... You're too weak?

1999
01:14:15,450 --> 01:14:16,850
That's loser talk.

2000
01:14:16,970 --> 01:14:18,730
Clearly, I wasn't too weak.

2001
01:14:22,690 --> 01:14:26,390
That's loser talk because I was able to farm it in the end.

2002
01:14:31,650 --> 01:14:33,470
I got teethered him.

2003
01:14:33,630 --> 01:14:33,970
Nice.

2004
01:14:34,330 --> 01:14:35,470
I teethered him.

2005
01:14:38,190 --> 01:14:38,830
Bye.

2006
01:14:38,830 --> 01:14:38,990
Bye.

2007
01:14:41,730 --> 01:14:47,870
I don't like holding it because I feel like I'm more accurate tapping it.

2008
01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:52,890
This fucky.

2009
01:14:53,090 --> 01:14:54,350
This fucky.

2010
01:15:00,490 --> 01:15:02,510
Oh my god.

2011
01:15:04,550 --> 01:15:06,590
He fucking distracted me.

2012
01:15:06,590 --> 01:15:07,970
All I did was shot him.

2013
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:08,750
He knew.

2014
01:15:08,810 --> 01:15:09,990
He knew I was too...

2015
01:15:12,670 --> 01:15:15,530
He knew all I wanted to do was shoot him.

2016
01:15:16,810 --> 01:15:18,190
He was so smart.

2017
01:15:18,910 --> 01:15:22,870
I wasn't farming because all I wanted to do was shoot this guy.

2018
01:15:25,110 --> 01:15:26,050
I hate him.

2019
01:15:26,170 --> 01:15:27,270
No, I'm doing it again.

2020
01:15:27,350 --> 01:15:28,430
I just want to shoot him.

2021
01:15:28,570 --> 01:15:31,090
I just... I can fly too, bitch.

2022
01:15:32,350 --> 01:15:33,890
I can also fly.

2023
01:15:33,970 --> 01:15:35,210
That's fucking right.

2024
01:15:35,550 --> 01:15:36,050
I...

2025
01:15:36,590 --> 01:15:38,610
I can also fly.

2026
01:15:39,070 --> 01:15:40,970
Oh, get teethered.

2027
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:46,650
I need to farm so badly.

2028
01:15:46,730 --> 01:15:48,010
I've not been doing it.

2029
01:15:52,010 --> 01:15:52,570
Okay.

2030
01:15:56,650 --> 01:15:58,250
I don't even have ult.

2031
01:15:58,330 --> 01:15:58,590
Wait.

2032
01:15:58,630 --> 01:15:58,810
What?

2033
01:16:00,350 --> 01:16:01,410
Fuck you.

2034
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:07,520
I heard it.

2035
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:16,020
I was like, wait.

2036
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:16,560
What was that?

2037
01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:17,520
What was that?

2038
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:18,820
What was that?

2039
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:21,700
I, like, turned around.

2040
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:22,320
I was like...

2041
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:24,460
Alright, guys.

2042
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:25,600
I'm leaving my lane.

2043
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:26,780
It's not worth it.

2044
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:31,300
I'm gonna farm.

2045
01:16:31,540 --> 01:16:33,340
I'm gonna go farm some stuff.

2046
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:34,520
Oh, no.

2047
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:35,680
Grandma's coming over.

2048
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:37,220
Grandma's coming over.

2049
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:38,060
She has...

2050
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:39,220
I don't even have my ult.

2051
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:39,840
Grandma.

2052
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:41,040
Please.

2053
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:43,120
I'm leaving.

2054
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:45,460
My teammate can handle this.

2055
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:46,340
I need to farm.

2056
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:48,080
Okay.

2057
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:51,560
Okay, it's fine.

2058
01:16:55,610 --> 01:16:56,310
It's fine.

2059
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:57,990
I'll be able to farm.

2060
01:16:59,570 --> 01:17:00,250
Don't worry.

2061
01:17:00,630 --> 01:17:01,390
It's okay.

2062
01:17:03,110 --> 01:17:03,830
That's fine.

2063
01:17:04,090 --> 01:17:05,010
And then...

2064
01:17:07,310 --> 01:17:08,230
Okay, don't worry.

2065
01:17:08,810 --> 01:17:09,510
Don't worry.

2066
01:17:10,270 --> 01:17:10,930
Don't worry.

2067
01:17:12,270 --> 01:17:13,750
I'll have my stuff now.

2068
01:17:14,150 --> 01:17:15,050
It's over.

2069
01:17:15,170 --> 01:17:16,030
I have my ult.

2070
01:17:17,130 --> 01:17:19,530
After 20 years, I have my ult.

2071
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:21,630
It's over for her.

2072
01:17:22,470 --> 01:17:24,010
It's so over.

2073
01:17:26,590 --> 01:17:27,490
Guys, I missed.

2074
01:17:29,130 --> 01:17:29,930
Guys, I missed.

2075
01:17:34,430 --> 01:17:35,650
It'll be over soon.

2076
01:17:37,090 --> 01:17:38,290
If I don't miss.

2077
01:17:39,370 --> 01:17:40,050
There we go.

2078
01:17:42,290 --> 01:17:43,250
Holy shit!

2079
01:17:43,350 --> 01:17:43,910
Okay, she's...

2080
01:17:43,910 --> 01:17:44,750
She's too much.

2081
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:45,390
She's too strong.

2082
01:17:46,030 --> 01:17:46,630
She's too strong.

2083
01:17:51,030 --> 01:17:51,590
Okay.

2084
01:17:52,550 --> 01:17:54,810
Maybe I should never swap off of Abra.

2085
01:17:58,910 --> 01:18:00,390
Alright, time to farm.

2086
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:01,330
Yay!

2087
01:18:02,870 --> 01:18:04,810
Toki, you need to help your team.

2088
01:18:05,010 --> 01:18:05,710
Guys, I...

2089
01:18:05,710 --> 01:18:07,130
I will...

2090
01:18:07,130 --> 01:18:09,310
I'm helping by farming.

2091
01:18:10,030 --> 01:18:10,590
Alright.

2092
01:18:11,330 --> 01:18:13,230
Why are you so...

2093
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:14,590
Why are you so poor?

2094
01:18:16,550 --> 01:18:17,990
Guys, please.

2095
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:19,270
Please don't...

2096
01:18:20,030 --> 01:18:22,990
All I did was shot the grandma.

2097
01:18:23,190 --> 01:18:25,250
I didn't farm anything.

2098
01:18:25,290 --> 01:18:27,570
I just wanted to shoot, guys.

2099
01:18:28,030 --> 01:18:28,650
I...

2100
01:18:29,610 --> 01:18:30,950
I didn't...

2101
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:36,550
I didn't farm any souls because all I wanted to do was shoot the grandma.

2102
01:18:36,910 --> 01:18:38,270
I got a friend!

2103
01:18:40,130 --> 01:18:40,850
Sorry.

2104
01:18:41,230 --> 01:18:43,690
I know I should have farmed.

2105
01:18:43,690 --> 01:18:45,890
And then all she was doing...

2106
01:18:46,310 --> 01:18:48,030
I don't have the MOBA brain!

2107
01:18:48,250 --> 01:18:49,790
I just want to pew-pew!

2108
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:57,030
Really, that's all I want to do.

2109
01:18:57,170 --> 01:18:59,150
I just wanted to pew-pew and...

2110
01:18:59,630 --> 01:19:00,270
And it...

2111
01:19:00,270 --> 01:19:01,930
It fucked me over.

2112
01:19:02,470 --> 01:19:08,390
It literally fucked me over because of it.

2113
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:09,550
Oh, I teetered him though.

2114
01:19:10,890 --> 01:19:11,810
Oh my god.

2115
01:19:11,850 --> 01:19:14,550
He has, like, almost doubled my souls.

2116
01:19:14,590 --> 01:19:15,330
I'm so fucked.

2117
01:19:16,170 --> 01:19:17,790
At least I'm farming now!

2118
01:19:18,010 --> 01:19:18,610
Guys, look!

2119
01:19:18,690 --> 01:19:19,090
I'm learning!

2120
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:20,910
I'm farming again!

2121
01:19:25,620 --> 01:19:27,040
I need to deny that.

2122
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:28,140
I need to deny that.

2123
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:29,540
Oh my god.

2124
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:34,120
Guys, look!

2125
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:35,220
Guys, look!

2126
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:36,000
Look, I'm doing it!

2127
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:40,660
Oh my god.

2128
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:41,040
What?

2129
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:42,240
He's so strong!

2130
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:44,600
Holy fuck!

2131
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:47,320
He's so...

2132
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:52,240
He's so... Guys, we're so fucked.

2133
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:55,560
He's too...

2134
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:58,600
He's too buff for my fucking character.

2135
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,100
I like how...

2136
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:03,020
He's like, I can't win the farm.

2137
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,820
Oh my god.

2138
01:20:09,220 --> 01:20:10,220
It's okay.

2139
01:20:10,340 --> 01:20:10,720
My...

2140
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,920
I don't have the boba brain.

2141
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:15,680
I'm sorry.

2142
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:17,280
I don't have...

2143
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:22,280
When I see people, I just want to shoot them, not the fucking creep.

2144
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:27,640
It's just... I just...

2145
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:31,680
I'm like, why do I shoot the weak minions when I can shoot... Guys!

2146
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:34,700
Why is nobody helping me fight the grandpa?

2147
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:36,920
Oh my god.

2148
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:38,040
He's just there!

2149
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:41,400
He's literally solo fucking...

2150
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:44,180
He's so...

2151
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:45,680
He's so...

2152
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:52,360
I can't... I can't do anything about it because he's so much stronger than me.

2153
01:20:54,220 --> 01:20:56,500
That's actually so fucked.

2154
01:20:56,780 --> 01:20:57,340
Like...

2155
01:20:58,140 --> 01:21:01,480
I can't win this 1v1.

2156
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:05,060
I'm not big fist man.

2157
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:08,740
I'm not big fist man.

2158
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:12,380
I'm trying my best.

2159
01:21:12,980 --> 01:21:13,920
I am.

2160
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:14,880
I truly am.

2161
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:18,300
I'll just farm these mini guys.

2162
01:21:18,620 --> 01:21:20,860
I need this so bad.

2163
01:21:21,260 --> 01:21:22,580
I... Guys, please!

2164
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:24,200
I need these more than you!

2165
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:25,000
Guys, please!

2166
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:25,640
I'm...

2167
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:26,920
Look at me!

2168
01:21:29,380 --> 01:21:31,040
Don't take them away!

2169
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:32,540
I need this more!

2170
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:33,300
Please!

2171
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:37,560
Please!

2172
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:39,540
Nice.

2173
01:21:41,140 --> 01:21:41,900
We're fine.

2174
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:45,240
Okay, this is fine.

2175
01:21:47,740 --> 01:21:48,800
This is okay.

2176
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:50,980
Alright, now...

2177
01:21:50,980 --> 01:21:55,020
Okay, after this, maybe we're just meant to be Abram.

2178
01:21:55,100 --> 01:21:56,560
Or we can try Haze!

2179
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,740
Haze seems like a fun DPS character.

2180
01:21:59,140 --> 01:22:02,260
Apparently, Haze is really good for late game or some shit.

2181
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:05,780
Okay.

2182
01:22:05,780 --> 01:22:06,460
See?

2183
01:22:06,580 --> 01:22:06,860
Look!

2184
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:07,780
Look, I'm doing it.

2185
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:10,920
I'm fucking doing it.

2186
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:13,760
Don't worry!

2187
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:15,560
She's coming!

2188
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:16,760
He's coming!

2189
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,840
200 million damage!

2190
01:22:22,260 --> 01:22:23,520
Team, please!

2191
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:25,420
He has so much HP!

2192
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:29,040
He has so much damage!

2193
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:30,400
Team!

2194
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:33,380
I need... I can't solo push him!

2195
01:22:33,620 --> 01:22:35,880
I literally can't 1v1 him!

2196
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,160
Alright, here we go.

2197
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:44,520
Alright.

2198
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:45,420
That's fine.

2199
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:47,160
I'll farm here.

2200
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:48,960
I'll farm here.

2201
01:22:49,940 --> 01:22:51,900
I'll take here as my farm.

2202
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:55,320
Guys, I already miss Abram.

2203
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:57,760
I miss playing Abram so much.

2204
01:22:58,140 --> 01:22:58,860
Nice!

2205
01:23:00,340 --> 01:23:02,160
I miss Abram.

2206
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:03,120
Abram was fun.

2207
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,580
Abram was so fun.

2208
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:10,240
Abram was so fun.

2209
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:11,540
I already miss Abram.

2210
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:13,280
I already miss Abram.

2211
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:15,060
Let's see.

2212
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:17,580
Let's see.

2213
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:19,640
Oh, where do I put Quicksilver bullets?

2214
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:19,860
Oh, where do I put Quicksilver bullets?

2215
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:22,640
I don't know where, so I didn't bother.

2216
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:24,680
Oh my god, they're over there!

2217
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:25,240
Okay.

2218
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:26,980
Wait, I got help.

2219
01:23:29,620 --> 01:23:30,560
Okay, nice.

2220
01:23:30,980 --> 01:23:31,720
Guys, see?

2221
01:23:31,820 --> 01:23:32,620
I'm doing it.

2222
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:34,660
No stink, just punch.

2223
01:23:34,780 --> 01:23:35,340
That's true.

2224
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:39,580
Wait, did he got killed by Grandpa?

2225
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:41,420
Okay.

2226
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:43,020
Oh, we unlocked flex slot!

2227
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:44,160
We did it, team!

2228
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:47,080
We fucking did it, team!

2229
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:48,420
Together!

2230
01:23:52,580 --> 01:23:54,580
Guys, we fucking did it!

2231
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:56,440
Okay.

2232
01:23:57,640 --> 01:23:58,160
Nice.

2233
01:23:58,340 --> 01:23:59,060
We got that.

2234
01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:00,860
Yippee!

2235
01:24:00,860 --> 01:24:03,020
Oh, he took out Grandpa!

2236
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:03,680
Yay!

2237
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:07,440
Oh my god.

2238
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:09,120
That's great.

2239
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:11,600
Now I can be safe.

2240
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:13,060
I'm not like...

2241
01:24:13,060 --> 01:24:17,280
I'm not like the weakest in terms of... Oh, there's two people that DC'd!

2242
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:18,600
Yay!

2243
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:22,000
Thank god.

2244
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:24,180
I don't get punished for...

2245
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:28,000
I don't get punished for not fucking doing anything.

2246
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,460
I love it when you don't get punished.

2247
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:31,260
Yippee!

2248
01:24:31,980 --> 01:24:33,100
Never punished!

2249
01:24:34,180 --> 01:24:35,040
Free win!

2250
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:35,940
Free win!

2251
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:36,780
Free win!

2252
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:41,760
I just want the Grandpa to DC so he could leave me alone.

2253
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:47,600
Honestly, I want the Grandpa to fucking leave.

2254
01:24:51,140 --> 01:24:51,700
Yay!

2255
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:55,340
Where's my team?

2256
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:57,280
Like, how did I get here?

2257
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:01,160
I'm gonna fucking walk to my teammates.

2258
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:02,060
Oh hey, free stuff.

2259
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:05,100
Oh my god.

2260
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:05,720
Don't worry, team!

2261
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:09,420
I haven't been helpful whatsoever, but don't worry.

2262
01:25:09,580 --> 01:25:10,780
This is where it stops.

2263
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:13,860
This is where it starts, being helpful.

2264
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:15,740
This is it.

2265
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:18,940
Right here!

2266
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:21,220
Look at that!

2267
01:25:21,620 --> 01:25:22,700
I'm so helpful.

2268
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:24,540
Oh god.

2269
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:24,960
Wait.

2270
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:25,680
Oh no.

2271
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:26,480
Oh no.

2272
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:28,520
I think the Gra- I heard the Grandpa.

2273
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:30,160
Fear.

2274
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:32,980
Actual fear.

2275
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:42,760
I heard the Grandpa and I felt real fear.

2276
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:43,700
Okay.

2277
01:25:47,450 --> 01:25:48,160
Oh shit!

2278
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:51,560
Oh my god!

2279
01:25:51,820 --> 01:25:52,480
Oh!

2280
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:53,800
Act- Fear!

2281
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,560
Oh my god.

2282
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Actual fear.

2283
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:01,740
Wait.

2284
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,160
Did my game crash?

2285
01:26:03,460 --> 01:26:04,020
Wait.

2286
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:04,320
What?

2287
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:05,920
What happened?

2288
01:26:07,260 --> 01:26:08,120
Where am I?

2289
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:09,520
What happened?

2290
01:26:12,820 --> 01:26:13,120
What?

2291
01:26:13,180 --> 01:26:14,180
Is this replay?

2292
01:26:14,780 --> 01:26:16,040
Oh, that was replay.

2293
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:18,060
I was like- Oh, I pressed R accidentally.

2294
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:22,080
I accidentally played R.

2295
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:26,740
Okay.

2296
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:28,260
Okay.

2297
01:26:28,260 --> 01:26:28,780
Give me a sec.

2298
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:29,120
Alright.

2299
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:30,000
Quicksilver.

2300
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:30,540
Oh!

2301
01:26:30,580 --> 01:26:31,480
Quicksilver on 4.

2302
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:31,820
Okay.

2303
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:32,580
Enduring speed.

2304
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,220
Guys, I don't like her.

2305
01:26:34,660 --> 01:26:36,320
I think I am an Arma player.

2306
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:38,860
I'm definitely an Arma player.

2307
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:39,420
Chat.

2308
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:41,920
I'm 100%- Wait.

2309
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:42,260
What?

2310
01:26:42,460 --> 01:26:46,840
Did the fucking Grandpa solo got all of this himself?

2311
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:48,800
Jesus Christ.

2312
01:26:49,460 --> 01:26:50,840
Or maybe I try Haze.

2313
01:26:50,860 --> 01:26:52,400
Maybe I'm more of a Haze player.

2314
01:26:53,420 --> 01:26:54,040
Maybe.

2315
01:26:55,700 --> 01:27:02,740
From- From fucking- From the fucking Fister to Sniper, we know where my place is.

2316
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:10,340
I was a better Fister than a than a Sniper.

2317
01:27:10,820 --> 01:27:11,820
That's for sure.

2318
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:15,960
There we go.

2319
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:17,100
I helped.

2320
01:27:17,940 --> 01:27:18,880
No, what?

2321
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:21,120
You know what I said.

2322
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:22,980
You know what I said.

2323
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:25,080
It's true.

2324
01:27:25,460 --> 01:27:28,780
You know I- You know I was doing great.

2325
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:33,880
I was doing great with it.

2326
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:37,740
Oh, wait.

2327
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:39,520
I- I misclicked that.

2328
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:42,560
I wish I was fast.

2329
01:27:44,140 --> 01:27:48,220
I wish I- No, Bebop is like- He's like Roadhog.

2330
01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:50,640
And I fucking- I'm so bad at Roadhog though.

2331
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:51,100
That's the thing.

2332
01:27:52,420 --> 01:27:54,220
I'm so bad at Roadhog.

2333
01:27:54,380 --> 01:27:54,660
I'm so bad at Roadhog.

2334
01:27:54,740 --> 01:28:01,440
So like, I don't think- I don't think it's possible for me to- I'm scared.

2335
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:02,080
I'm scared.

2336
01:28:04,820 --> 01:28:08,040
I know like Haze has like a lot of DPS though.

2337
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:10,880
I know that.

2338
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:12,080
Oh.

2339
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:14,120
Oh no, I'm scared.

2340
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:17,660
Guys, I don't want to get- That's fine.

2341
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:20,400
I was gonna say, I don't want the grandpa to hit me.

2342
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:22,240
Oh fuck, okay.

2343
01:28:23,660 --> 01:28:24,100
Yay!

2344
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,200
It's fine.

2345
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:27,000
Team is fine.

2346
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:30,580
Team is so fine.

2347
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:32,260
Oh, sorry.

2348
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:34,420
I have grandpa PTSD right now.

2349
01:28:34,540 --> 01:28:38,260
I actually- I actually have grandpa PTSD every time.

2350
01:28:38,540 --> 01:28:40,820
I'm like looking behind me and being like, is he there?

2351
01:28:40,980 --> 01:28:43,360
Is he- Is he there?

2352
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:48,140
Like- I know what I'm scared of.

2353
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:49,200
I'm so scared of him.

2354
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:51,340
I'm actually so scared of him.

2355
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:55,540
Oh, so that's what it does!

2356
01:28:55,780 --> 01:28:57,040
Okay, I figured it out.

2357
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:00,820
I figured it out.

2358
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:03,080
Can I just shoot this guy?

2359
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:03,900
No, it's too far.

2360
01:29:04,060 --> 01:29:04,380
Okay.

2361
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:05,660
What do I do?

2362
01:29:05,820 --> 01:29:06,660
Do I just do this?

2363
01:29:07,580 --> 01:29:09,180
What do I do when I'm in the air?

2364
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:13,360
I'm just like, What do I do when I'm in the air?

2365
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:14,980
I just do that?

2366
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:17,200
I guess I do.

2367
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:22,200
Do I enjoy- It depends on what I'm- It depends on who- My lane.

2368
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:23,200
I feel like.

2369
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:26,220
Right now, this is my first time playing the sniper lady.

2370
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:29,180
And I- I also don't know what I'm doing.

2371
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:30,460
So like, there's also that.

2372
01:29:30,580 --> 01:29:30,920
Like-

2373
01:29:33,940 --> 01:29:36,000
I don't know what- Too far?

2374
01:29:36,180 --> 01:29:38,460
When am I not- When am I close enough?

2375
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:39,320
Like here?

2376
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:40,940
Okay, here.

2377
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:41,980
Okay.

2378
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:43,880
Alright, we figured it out.

2379
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:45,120
I was like, too far?

2380
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:46,960
I'm literally right next to him!

2381
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:48,380
I was like, too far?

2382
01:29:48,380 --> 01:29:48,380
I'm literally right next to him!

2383
01:29:48,380 --> 01:29:49,760
How am I too far?

2384
01:29:50,820 --> 01:29:51,980
Wait, my base?

2385
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:54,060
Oh, shit.

2386
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:55,280
Oh.

2387
01:29:55,980 --> 01:29:56,620
Oops.

2388
01:29:57,720 --> 01:29:58,360
Okay.

2389
01:29:58,360 --> 01:29:59,200
That's fine.

2390
01:30:00,460 --> 01:30:02,540
My teammates got this, right?

2391
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:03,200
My teammates got this, right?

2392
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:06,400
Who's attacking my shrine?

2393
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:07,640
It's Grandpa!

2394
01:30:07,820 --> 01:30:08,520
Who else?

2395
01:30:09,140 --> 01:30:10,680
It's always Grandpa!

2396
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:11,000
Grandpa!

2397
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,580
It's- It's always him!

2398
01:30:15,140 --> 01:30:17,780
He's always attacking my shrine!

2399
01:30:21,660 --> 01:30:23,900
He's always there!

2400
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:29,900
It's always him.

2401
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:32,480
It's always him.

2402
01:30:36,780 --> 01:30:38,420
Every time.

2403
01:30:38,940 --> 01:30:40,660
Wait, I need to be in the pit.

2404
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:41,660
This is stupid.

2405
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:42,120
Okay.

2406
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:44,720
I actually have to be in this pit to do this.

2407
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:46,660
What if I just do that?

2408
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:48,140
Yay!

2409
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:52,560
I did it.

2410
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:55,960
I did it.

2411
01:30:56,460 --> 01:30:58,440
I don't know what I was doing, but I did it.

2412
01:30:58,460 --> 01:30:59,180
I wanna try Haze.

2413
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:03,080
I think Haze might be more fun because it's more DPS intensive.

2414
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:03,760
Oh, hey!

2415
01:31:04,940 --> 01:31:05,820
23,000.

2416
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:09,840
Holy f- How did she do- How did you do worse than me?

2417
01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:20,940
Oh!

2418
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:32,860
Sorry.

2419
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:41,900
Alright.

2420
01:31:44,340 --> 01:31:45,760
Oh my god.

2421
01:31:46,040 --> 01:31:47,380
Oh!

2422
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:49,600
At least it's fine.

2423
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:50,840
Oh my god!

2424
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:51,260
How?

2425
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:52,400
1,900!

2426
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:53,700
Thank god!

2427
01:31:53,700 --> 01:31:54,860
Thank god you carried me.

2428
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:56,540
Thank god!

2429
01:31:56,900 --> 01:31:59,840
Thank god she carried me.

2430
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:01,720
Okay.

2431
01:32:01,860 --> 01:32:03,840
So now I'm gonna try Haze.

2432
01:32:03,900 --> 01:32:05,560
Honestly, it's still Abrams.

2433
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:07,000
Abrams is my favorite still.

2434
01:32:07,900 --> 01:32:10,740
Uh, I don't know about Haze though.

2435
01:32:10,820 --> 01:32:13,120
Apparently she has a steep dart like Ana.

2436
01:32:14,260 --> 01:32:15,460
Like this.

2437
01:32:15,460 --> 01:32:17,160
It makes her- makes them go...

2438
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:17,740
eepy?

2439
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:22,400
It makes them go eepy?

2440
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:25,200
And then...

2441
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:26,980
there's the smoke bomb.

2442
01:32:28,020 --> 01:32:29,360
And... what's this?

2443
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:31,340
Oh yeah, this is the Reaper ult!

2444
01:32:32,220 --> 01:32:33,060
This is it!

2445
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:35,580
Okay, this is...

2446
01:32:35,580 --> 01:32:36,600
This is the...

2447
01:32:37,340 --> 01:32:38,880
This is the Reaper ult.

2448
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:39,360
Okay.

2449
01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:40,680
Alright, that's fine.

2450
01:32:41,620 --> 01:32:43,120
Alright, build time.

2451
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:44,900
We gotta figure out the build.

2452
01:32:46,420 --> 01:32:48,260
We gotta figure out the build.

2453
01:32:49,940 --> 01:32:50,640
We gotta figure out the build.

2454
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:53,220
Alright, uh...

2455
01:32:55,820 --> 01:32:56,820
I guess...

2456
01:32:56,820 --> 01:32:58,920
Oh, it's all-time favorite!

2457
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:01,540
Wait, what's better?

2458
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:03,020
More improvements.

2459
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:06,500
The change has felt great and is more in line with Haze.

2460
01:33:06,580 --> 01:33:12,420
From the original comes a more diverse arrangement of the bulletproof rapid Haze formula.

2461
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:17,220
With more tools, we can meet the unique demands of every matchup we face.

2462
01:33:17,380 --> 01:33:19,600
If you're ready for the next step, look no further.

2463
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:20,360
Wait, do I...

2464
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:22,440
Do I do the advanced build?

2465
01:33:22,660 --> 01:33:23,720
Or the normal build?

2466
01:33:24,660 --> 01:33:26,200
The one that has Ricochet?

2467
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:29,120
Super early game.

2468
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:32,680
The fuck does this mean?

2469
01:33:33,660 --> 01:33:34,180
Okay.

2470
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,560
Yeah, let's do the...

2471
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:38,860
Let's do the normal one.

2472
01:33:38,860 --> 01:33:41,100
Yeah, I'm like...

2473
01:33:41,100 --> 01:33:41,920
It's like...

2474
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:43,660
Frequency Seize.

2475
01:33:44,540 --> 01:33:47,120
Tanks and lead to spirit damage.

2476
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:48,700
I'm like...

2477
01:33:48,700 --> 01:33:50,340
The fuck does lead to...

2478
01:33:50,340 --> 01:33:52,440
What the fuck is...

2479
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:55,120
Alright, we're gonna do the normal one.

2480
01:33:55,640 --> 01:33:57,480
It has Ricochet here.

2481
01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:02,180
The normal one.

2482
01:34:03,660 --> 01:34:05,700
The normal one sounds good.

2483
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:07,040
Yeah.

2484
01:34:07,340 --> 01:34:08,360
Oh yeah, yeah!

2485
01:34:08,860 --> 01:34:09,380
The lifesteal.

2486
01:34:09,420 --> 01:34:10,720
That's why Haze is really good.

2487
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:12,640
I heard about it.

2488
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:14,940
Maybe we just play...

2489
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:17,420
Look, maybe I'm just as good as...

2490
01:34:17,420 --> 01:34:19,340
Just as good as Haze!

2491
01:34:19,340 --> 01:34:20,120
As Abrams!

2492
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:20,920
You don't know that!

2493
01:34:21,340 --> 01:34:22,780
I could be just as...

2494
01:34:22,780 --> 01:34:24,760
The Sniper Lady was just not for me!

2495
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:25,400
We learned!

2496
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:30,060
We learned that I can't be the Sniper Lady because all I do is shoot people instead of farming.

2497
01:34:30,340 --> 01:34:35,580
Like, when they give me a Sniper, all I wanna do is shoot the person and not the creeps.

2498
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:40,280
And then when I was playing Abrams, I had... I could punch the creeps, so like...

2499
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:43,120
So like, I was willing to farm more.

2500
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:48,580
This time it'll be different!

2501
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:50,120
Guys, this time!

2502
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:52,200
This time I'll definitely...

2503
01:34:52,780 --> 01:34:54,980
I'll definitely farm, I swear to God.

2504
01:34:57,220 --> 01:34:58,420
This time!

2505
01:34:58,580 --> 01:35:00,660
It'll be so different, chat, I swear.

2506
01:35:01,880 --> 01:35:05,320
I'll learn how to farm now, I swear to God.

2507
01:35:05,320 --> 01:35:06,320
I learned!

2508
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:08,840
I learned how to farm now!

2509
01:35:11,180 --> 01:35:12,220
I swear!

2510
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:15,100
This'll be so easy.

2511
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:17,080
Alright, let's see.

2512
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:18,880
Okay.

2513
01:35:20,940 --> 01:35:21,700
Alright.

2514
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:24,840
Okay, here we go.

2515
01:35:25,540 --> 01:35:26,300
Uh...

2516
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:27,820
Alright.

2517
01:35:29,300 --> 01:35:31,720
Okay, we're never touching her again.

2518
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:33,700
We never!

2519
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:35,580
Okay.

2520
01:35:36,620 --> 01:35:39,180
I don't know what else to do after that.

2521
01:35:39,420 --> 01:35:40,220
I don't know.

2522
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:42,120
I have to pick one more.

2523
01:35:42,340 --> 01:35:43,080
Okay, I guess I'll...

2524
01:35:43,080 --> 01:35:45,340
I guess I'll put her in there just in case.

2525
01:35:46,340 --> 01:35:46,780
Name!

2526
01:35:47,260 --> 01:35:49,240
Thank you for... Welcome to Tomato Farm!

2527
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:49,980
Welcome, welcome!

2528
01:35:51,940 --> 01:35:52,380
Okay.

2529
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:55,620
Sorry, I'm messing.

2530
01:36:04,430 --> 01:36:05,610
Alright, enter queue.

2531
01:36:06,930 --> 01:36:07,730
This is it.

2532
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:12,340
This is it.

2533
01:36:12,420 --> 01:36:13,060
This is it.

2534
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:14,240
We'll be fine.

2535
01:36:16,260 --> 01:36:17,380
I swear to God.

2536
01:36:17,740 --> 01:36:20,040
Okay, I guess we're just meant to be Abrams.

2537
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:20,840
I...

2538
01:36:24,580 --> 01:36:25,700
I guess...

2539
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:26,720
I guess... Wait!

2540
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:29,020
We don't even have...

2541
01:36:29,020 --> 01:36:31,460
Wait, how come I don't get him?!

2542
01:36:35,380 --> 01:36:35,940
What?!

2543
01:36:35,940 --> 01:36:38,180
None of you are even playing Haze!

2544
01:36:38,180 --> 01:36:40,860
Oh, you're playing Haze!

2545
01:36:41,260 --> 01:36:43,960
Oh, we can't have a mirror match!

2546
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:44,680
Oh!

2547
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:48,980
Am I solo-lady?

2548
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:50,260
When will I have friends?

2549
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:56,160
When the fu- This is fucked.

2550
01:36:56,460 --> 01:36:58,240
This is so fucked.

2551
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:04,500
This is so fucked.

2552
01:37:07,660 --> 01:37:09,040
Oh my God.

2553
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:09,540
Oh my God.

2554
01:37:09,540 --> 01:37:09,660
Oh my God.

2555
01:37:09,660 --> 01:37:10,980
Okay, it's fine.

2556
01:37:11,180 --> 01:37:12,020
I don't need...

2557
01:37:12,020 --> 01:37:16,060
I don't need... I do not need another person to lane with me.

2558
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:20,060
No, the thing is, is that, like, whoever you're laning with, it's randomized.

2559
01:37:20,220 --> 01:37:20,980
I think.

2560
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:24,620
Because sometimes you get nobody, and sometimes you do, and it's so fucked.

2561
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:28,300
Like, I'm just that unlucky.

2562
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:34,400
I'm literally just that unlucky when it comes to, like, nobody... no people.

2563
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:35,280
Nobody laning.

2564
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:36,840
Like, literally.

2565
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:41,340
I'm just that unlucky.

2566
01:37:42,020 --> 01:37:43,320
I don't know how.

2567
01:37:43,700 --> 01:37:47,380
I legitimately don't know how I'm so unlucky when it comes to that.

2568
01:37:50,620 --> 01:37:51,580
What the fuck?

2569
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:52,580
Learn how to aim.

2570
01:37:52,940 --> 01:37:53,500
Like...

2571
01:37:58,720 --> 01:38:00,400
Like, holy shit.

2572
01:38:04,780 --> 01:38:05,840
Oh my god.

2573
01:38:10,770 --> 01:38:11,490
Oh my god.

2574
01:38:15,750 --> 01:38:16,390
...

2575
01:38:17,090 --> 01:38:17,730
...

2576
01:38:17,730 --> 01:38:17,990
...

2577
01:38:23,990 --> 01:38:24,630
Nice.

2578
01:38:25,370 --> 01:38:25,770
...

2579
01:38:27,930 --> 01:38:29,130
Oh, shit!

2580
01:38:29,250 --> 01:38:30,190
I'm fucking... I'm sorry!

2581
01:38:30,190 --> 01:38:32,730
I wasn't paying attention after that!

2582
01:38:32,830 --> 01:38:34,090
I thought I was so funny!

2583
01:38:36,130 --> 01:38:41,270
I wasn't paying attention because he fucking died so fast.

2584
01:38:41,650 --> 01:38:50,170
I... bro... bro... I told you noobs don't know how to parry!

2585
01:38:50,390 --> 01:38:52,950
It was pretty funny though.

2586
01:38:53,710 --> 01:38:57,890
I was not paying attention to my HP right after.

2587
01:38:58,110 --> 01:38:59,870
Noobs just don't know how to parry.

2588
01:38:59,870 --> 01:39:00,750
What can I say?

2589
01:39:02,050 --> 01:39:03,770
What can I fucking say?

2590
01:39:09,370 --> 01:39:10,950
Alright, let's go back in.

2591
01:39:13,750 --> 01:39:15,010
Let's go back in.

2592
01:39:15,170 --> 01:39:16,070
I'm coming back.

2593
01:39:16,350 --> 01:39:17,410
I'm coming back.

2594
01:39:17,470 --> 01:39:18,550
Oh, that's fucking right.

2595
01:39:18,650 --> 01:39:19,290
I'm coming back.

2596
01:39:19,530 --> 01:39:20,730
Oh, you thought you can...

2597
01:39:23,390 --> 01:39:25,430
You thought you can just be here?

2598
01:39:25,670 --> 01:39:28,090
You thought you can just be over here?

2599
01:39:35,710 --> 01:39:36,750
Where did he go?

2600
01:39:38,470 --> 01:39:40,150
Take a nap, kid.

2601
01:39:42,170 --> 01:39:42,730
Alright.

2602
01:39:43,270 --> 01:39:44,610
That guy is bad.

2603
01:39:44,870 --> 01:39:45,410
That fucking...

2604
01:39:45,410 --> 01:39:45,830
Thank god.

2605
01:39:46,130 --> 01:39:48,270
Thank god.

2606
01:39:49,270 --> 01:39:50,690
Thank god he's bad.

2607
01:39:51,210 --> 01:39:52,270
Oh my god.

2608
01:39:52,590 --> 01:39:54,490
Thank fucking god, dude.

2609
01:39:55,850 --> 01:39:56,350
That's great.

2610
01:39:56,530 --> 01:39:57,370
I need that.

2611
01:39:57,990 --> 01:39:59,370
I fucking needed that.

2612
01:40:02,370 --> 01:40:04,530
I'm farming him, I need that, dude!

2613
01:40:12,430 --> 01:40:14,070
That's fine.

2614
01:40:14,270 --> 01:40:15,530
I'm farming.

2615
01:40:18,990 --> 01:40:20,770
Stay in my lane!

2616
01:40:22,230 --> 01:40:23,950
Stay in my lane!

2617
01:40:28,170 --> 01:40:29,790
That's fucking right!

2618
01:40:32,090 --> 01:40:33,710
Okay, he's almost dead.

2619
01:40:36,570 --> 01:40:37,410
Nice.

2620
01:40:37,430 --> 01:40:38,630
See, it's that easy.

2621
01:40:40,730 --> 01:40:41,570
Nice.

2622
01:40:41,710 --> 01:40:42,990
I should upgrade.

2623
01:40:43,390 --> 01:40:44,810
I should upgrade!

2624
01:40:45,410 --> 01:40:46,390
Oh, he's back!

2625
01:40:46,630 --> 01:40:47,430
Hey there!

2626
01:40:48,090 --> 01:40:48,710
Hey!

2627
01:40:49,770 --> 01:40:50,610
Hey!

2628
01:40:54,030 --> 01:40:56,170
Oh, he's so lucky!

2629
01:40:56,410 --> 01:40:58,290
He's so lucky!

2630
01:41:00,290 --> 01:41:01,830
Oh, man.

2631
01:41:02,290 --> 01:41:03,630
You're so lucky.

2632
01:41:03,650 --> 01:41:03,690
You're so lucky.

2633
01:41:03,710 --> 01:41:05,170
I need to go shopping.

2634
01:41:05,530 --> 01:41:07,670
I need to go shopping.

2635
01:41:08,550 --> 01:41:09,030
Okay.

2636
01:41:09,410 --> 01:41:10,510
Thanks for the money.

2637
01:41:13,510 --> 01:41:14,290
Alright, nice.

2638
01:41:17,210 --> 01:41:17,950
Poor guy.

2639
01:41:18,290 --> 01:41:19,030
Thank God.

2640
01:41:19,490 --> 01:41:20,170
Thank God.

2641
01:41:20,210 --> 01:41:20,850
I'm so happy.

2642
01:41:20,950 --> 01:41:21,490
This is what I mean!

2643
01:41:23,090 --> 01:41:25,950
When he doesn't know how to jump, it's so easy!

2644
01:41:30,590 --> 01:41:32,030
I had the most...

2645
01:41:32,030 --> 01:41:32,850
I swear.

2646
01:41:32,910 --> 01:41:33,550
I told you guys.

2647
01:41:33,550 --> 01:41:38,110
I had the most fucking unlucky matchup before.

2648
01:41:38,370 --> 01:41:39,530
Now it's fine.

2649
01:41:40,050 --> 01:41:41,750
Now this matchup is okay.

2650
01:41:42,470 --> 01:41:44,030
Now let's help this guy.

2651
01:41:44,910 --> 01:41:46,870
This guy is the one that took the haze from me.

2652
01:41:46,910 --> 01:41:47,590
I fucking hate him.

2653
01:41:48,410 --> 01:41:49,830
He took my haze.

2654
01:41:49,830 --> 01:41:51,070
I fucking take your life.

2655
01:41:54,950 --> 01:41:57,010
I fucking take your life.

2656
01:41:57,230 --> 01:41:57,250
I fucking take your life.

2657
01:41:57,450 --> 01:42:01,750
I fucking take your life.

2658
01:42:01,870 --> 01:42:03,490
Oh, you're so lucky.

2659
01:42:03,730 --> 01:42:04,370
Oh, my God.

2660
01:42:04,370 --> 01:42:06,570
I was gonna take your life for taking my fucking...

2661
01:42:06,570 --> 01:42:07,730
For taking...

2662
01:42:07,730 --> 01:42:09,890
For taking the haze.

2663
01:42:09,970 --> 01:42:11,410
I wanted to play haze.

2664
01:42:11,590 --> 01:42:12,330
Oh, he's back!

2665
01:42:12,990 --> 01:42:14,230
The baby's back.

2666
01:42:14,290 --> 01:42:15,310
I'm coming over, baby.

2667
01:42:16,090 --> 01:42:17,110
Oh, you're back.

2668
01:42:17,230 --> 01:42:18,010
Oh, don't worry.

2669
01:42:20,630 --> 01:42:21,970
Oh, you're back.

2670
01:42:22,110 --> 01:42:23,330
Oh, I'm heading over.

2671
01:42:23,870 --> 01:42:25,830
I'm heading over, little baby.

2672
01:42:27,070 --> 01:42:28,410
I'm heading over.

2673
01:42:28,830 --> 01:42:29,670
That's right.

2674
01:42:34,820 --> 01:42:35,400
Let's go!

2675
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:39,020
Where did you go?

2676
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:44,840
It's fine.

2677
01:42:45,080 --> 01:42:46,440
You can have it.

2678
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:47,240
I don't care.

2679
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:49,820
You can fucking have it.

2680
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:54,120
He deserves it.

2681
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:55,480
He needs it.

2682
01:42:55,860 --> 01:42:58,780
No, he fucking needs it more than me.

2683
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:01,100
Like, he thinks I care?

2684
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:03,880
That little baby deserved it.

2685
01:43:04,440 --> 01:43:05,360
Alright, nice.

2686
01:43:06,120 --> 01:43:06,860
Can I get this now?

2687
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:07,520
Nice.

2688
01:43:10,340 --> 01:43:11,100
Okay.

2689
01:43:12,820 --> 01:43:13,640
We're fine.

2690
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:16,760
Stop!

2691
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:20,340
I deserve this!

2692
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:22,440
I deserve this!

2693
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:24,400
What do you mean?

2694
01:43:25,180 --> 01:43:27,540
After everything I've been through!

2695
01:43:27,820 --> 01:43:29,640
I deserve this!

2696
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:32,320
Give it to me!

2697
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:35,080
Oh, he's back.

2698
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:37,180
That's fine.

2699
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:39,460
Is the baby coming over?

2700
01:43:45,300 --> 01:43:45,800
Really?

2701
01:43:48,820 --> 01:43:54,860
Oh my god, you saw that?

2702
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:55,240
Yeah!

2703
01:43:56,540 --> 01:43:57,740
You saw that?

2704
01:43:58,180 --> 01:43:58,680
Yeah!

2705
01:43:59,140 --> 01:44:00,080
He's bad.

2706
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:01,400
He's bad.

2707
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:04,080
That's good.

2708
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:06,480
I'm glad you saw that.

2709
01:44:06,600 --> 01:44:07,700
Not enough for the best gear.

2710
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:10,660
What is he doing?

2711
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:12,260
Fucking watch this guy!

2712
01:44:12,340 --> 01:44:12,820
Look at this guy!

2713
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:16,480
Oh shit.

2714
01:44:17,100 --> 01:44:18,060
Got hit there.

2715
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:19,360
What the fuck?

2716
01:44:19,380 --> 01:44:19,880
I got hit!

2717
01:44:21,200 --> 01:44:21,720
Okay.

2718
01:44:22,700 --> 01:44:23,620
Oh shit.

2719
01:44:23,780 --> 01:44:24,640
Oh shit.

2720
01:44:25,480 --> 01:44:25,860
Goodbye.

2721
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:28,340
Oh my god.

2722
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:29,680
Oh my god.

2723
01:44:29,720 --> 01:44:32,040
Another teammate showed up to help.

2724
01:44:32,180 --> 01:44:33,140
That's illegal.

2725
01:44:36,620 --> 01:44:37,900
That's actually illegal.

2726
01:44:38,120 --> 01:44:39,200
I can't believe it.

2727
01:44:40,080 --> 01:44:42,380
I can't believe he showed up.

2728
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:44,080
Alright.

2729
01:44:44,180 --> 01:44:44,740
It's fine.

2730
01:44:45,640 --> 01:44:46,320
Yay!

2731
01:44:48,780 --> 01:44:50,280
We got a shot now.

2732
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:54,760
I can't believe it.

2733
01:44:55,020 --> 01:44:56,320
He's gotta learn!

2734
01:44:56,840 --> 01:44:59,180
He's gotta learn about the matchup!

2735
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:01,220
Okay.

2736
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:02,880
Alright.

2737
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:03,460
Nice.

2738
01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:04,140
Oh!

2739
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:04,720
He's back.

2740
01:45:05,100 --> 01:45:06,580
I'm getting over.

2741
01:45:06,820 --> 01:45:07,460
He's back.

2742
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:08,580
He's back.

2743
01:45:08,680 --> 01:45:09,280
He's...

2744
01:45:12,770 --> 01:45:13,100
Zoom!

2745
01:45:14,120 --> 01:45:15,160
I'm ready.

2746
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:17,620
I'm so ready.

2747
01:45:28,360 --> 01:45:31,360
I had to zoom.

2748
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:33,920
I had to zoom.

2749
01:45:34,620 --> 01:45:35,240
No.

2750
01:45:35,260 --> 01:45:35,680
You don't understand.

2751
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:37,460
It was very important for me to do that.

2752
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:39,920
I had to zoom.

2753
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:42,360
I needed to kill him first.

2754
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:42,960
Guys.

2755
01:45:43,060 --> 01:45:43,720
You don't understand.

2756
01:45:44,340 --> 01:45:46,240
I had to kill him first.

2757
01:45:48,300 --> 01:45:49,400
I had to.

2758
01:45:51,880 --> 01:45:53,720
I needed that farm.

2759
01:45:54,740 --> 01:45:55,820
You don't understand.

2760
01:45:55,960 --> 01:45:58,460
I really needed that farm, guys.

2761
01:45:59,660 --> 01:46:00,220
Punch.

2762
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:01,600
Punch.

2763
01:46:02,460 --> 01:46:03,020
Punch.

2764
01:46:03,240 --> 01:46:03,600
Alright.

2765
01:46:03,780 --> 01:46:04,640
Off we go.

2766
01:46:05,020 --> 01:46:06,460
You can't learn like this.

2767
01:46:06,460 --> 01:46:08,240
Well, I had to learn like this!

2768
01:46:08,620 --> 01:46:11,820
If I had to learn like this, so does he!

2769
01:46:19,060 --> 01:46:19,660
Sorry!

2770
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:26,920
Sink or swim!

2771
01:46:29,020 --> 01:46:33,740
If I had to learn like this, they have to learn like this too!

2772
01:46:36,580 --> 01:46:37,280
Disgusting!

2773
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:41,040
Let's just be like that!

2774
01:46:43,250 --> 01:46:43,700
Come on!

2775
01:46:43,960 --> 01:46:44,560
Whoa!

2776
01:46:44,980 --> 01:46:45,540
Come on!

2777
01:46:50,640 --> 01:46:53,880
Guys, I'm an Abramein!

2778
01:46:54,540 --> 01:46:56,760
I'm an Abramein!

2779
01:46:58,240 --> 01:46:59,180
Watch this!

2780
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:03,080
He's too scared to move!

2781
01:47:03,580 --> 01:47:05,040
He's so scared!

2782
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:07,240
He's too scared!

2783
01:47:08,060 --> 01:47:08,980
Come on!

2784
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:10,120
Come on!

2785
01:47:11,260 --> 01:47:12,020
Come on!

2786
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:13,400
Come on!

2787
01:47:13,400 --> 01:47:14,360
Get over here!

2788
01:47:14,640 --> 01:47:16,320
Get over here, little guy!

2789
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:18,340
Get over here!

2790
01:47:19,060 --> 01:47:19,740
Come on!

2791
01:47:20,300 --> 01:47:22,440
Get over here!

2792
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:23,280
Awwww!

2793
01:47:25,160 --> 01:47:25,840
Aww!

2794
01:47:26,120 --> 01:47:27,420
I'll go help my team!

2795
01:47:27,580 --> 01:47:29,300
I'll let this little baby go!

2796
01:47:30,260 --> 01:47:32,380
I'll let the little baby go!

2797
01:47:32,660 --> 01:47:33,560
Come on!

2798
01:47:34,120 --> 01:47:43,900
Get over there, baby!

2799
01:47:56,410 --> 01:47:56,410
Wait,

2800
01:48:00,430 --> 01:48:00,430
wait!

2801
01:48:01,250 --> 01:48:02,610
Where is she?

2802
01:48:02,730 --> 01:48:03,070
Where is she?

2803
01:48:03,690 --> 01:48:08,340
Get back out here, baby!

2804
01:48:08,700 --> 01:48:08,980
Where is she?

2805
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:10,620
Wait, what happened?

2806
01:48:10,620 --> 01:48:10,660
You're kicking his ass.

2807
01:48:11,880 --> 01:48:12,600
Oh shit!

2808
01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:13,840
He's coming back!

2809
01:48:13,860 --> 01:48:14,640
He's back, guys!

2810
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:15,760
Guys, he's back!

2811
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:18,420
Guys, the child is back!

2812
01:48:22,020 --> 01:48:23,820
Where are you, child?

2813
01:48:28,740 --> 01:48:29,440
That's right!

2814
01:48:31,180 --> 01:48:32,300
I'm coming!

2815
01:48:32,380 --> 01:48:34,320
Oh, you think you can run?

2816
01:48:36,980 --> 01:48:39,300
You can't run from me!

2817
01:48:41,300 --> 01:48:42,960
You think you can run?

2818
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:45,960
Nice, alright.

2819
01:48:47,060 --> 01:48:48,100
We got the child.

2820
01:48:48,460 --> 01:48:50,320
We got the child!

2821
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,480
We just had to get him.

2822
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:56,360
That's really it.

2823
01:48:58,380 --> 01:49:00,600
Mission traumatized the child!

2824
01:49:00,900 --> 01:49:07,000
If I had to go through the torture of playing this game not knowing what the fuck I was doing...

2825
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:08,340
He does too.

2826
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:19,440
I'm coming over!

2827
01:49:20,500 --> 01:49:22,200
Oh, you think you can run?

2828
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:23,220
Oh, shit!

2829
01:49:23,300 --> 01:49:24,120
Okay, never mind.

2830
01:49:24,180 --> 01:49:26,040
Child came back to help his teammate.

2831
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:29,000
She had been traumatized too, so he knows how it feels.

2832
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:32,000
Oh, you think...

2833
01:49:38,060 --> 01:49:39,280
Okay, where are you?

2834
01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:40,200
Where's sad lady?

2835
01:49:40,340 --> 01:49:41,260
Sad lady!

2836
01:49:41,940 --> 01:49:43,360
Sad lady!

2837
01:49:43,480 --> 01:49:45,440
Your fucking friend farmed...

2838
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:46,780
Let me farm them!

2839
01:49:49,940 --> 01:49:51,780
They did this.

2840
01:49:53,120 --> 01:49:54,600
Alright, I'll come back and help.

2841
01:49:55,360 --> 01:49:56,080
Alright.

2842
01:49:56,280 --> 01:49:56,880
Nice.

2843
01:49:57,380 --> 01:49:59,580
Farm heroes, not minions!

2844
01:50:01,820 --> 01:50:03,840
I'm so tanky now.

2845
01:50:04,020 --> 01:50:07,800
All I'm saying is that this was all because of that baby.

2846
01:50:07,800 --> 01:50:08,880
Oh, baby's back!

2847
01:50:09,480 --> 01:50:10,240
Baby's back!

2848
01:50:10,540 --> 01:50:11,100
Don't worry.

2849
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:15,360
I will go back, but let me kill this one guy first.

2850
01:50:16,160 --> 01:50:16,760
Hey!

2851
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:18,900
I'm coming over!

2852
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:21,640
Hey there, child!

2853
01:50:23,080 --> 01:50:23,680
Hey!

2854
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:25,000
Yes!

2855
01:50:31,540 --> 01:50:33,060
Wait, where did you go?

2856
01:50:34,660 --> 01:50:35,260
Okay.

2857
01:50:35,260 --> 01:50:37,760
Alright, now I need to buy items.

2858
01:50:37,980 --> 01:50:39,420
Run, baby!

2859
01:50:39,620 --> 01:50:40,580
Get out of there!

2860
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:42,360
Get out of there!

2861
01:50:43,140 --> 01:50:43,900
Alright.

2862
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:45,820
Oh, he left.

2863
01:50:50,980 --> 01:50:53,440
My first rage quit, let's go!

2864
01:50:54,120 --> 01:50:55,500
Let's fucking go!

2865
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:57,080
Let's fucking go!

2866
01:50:58,980 --> 01:51:01,200
He actually quit!

2867
01:51:01,720 --> 01:51:03,240
Holy fuck!

2868
01:51:03,340 --> 01:51:04,940
He quit the game!

2869
01:51:05,820 --> 01:51:07,240
Let's fucking go!

2870
01:51:07,560 --> 01:51:09,680
Okay, now I see why people like MOBAs.

2871
01:51:09,820 --> 01:51:10,440
Now...

2872
01:51:10,440 --> 01:51:12,340
Look what you did!

2873
01:51:14,020 --> 01:51:15,260
What happened?

2874
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:16,060
Doki!

2875
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:18,640
What the fuck happened?

2876
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:23,460
Wait, who did this to you?

2877
01:51:23,720 --> 01:51:24,900
You don't understand.

2878
01:51:25,060 --> 01:51:27,440
This was me when I first tried to play this game.

2879
01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:29,180
This was literally me.

2880
01:51:29,900 --> 01:51:31,660
You don't understand.

2881
01:51:32,860 --> 01:51:35,180
I had to do this too.

2882
01:51:38,480 --> 01:51:39,420
That's fucking right.

2883
01:51:42,280 --> 01:51:43,480
It's time to punch.

2884
01:51:45,220 --> 01:51:45,960
Where is he?

2885
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:49,520
Where is he?

2886
01:51:51,340 --> 01:51:51,740
Oh!

2887
01:51:52,940 --> 01:51:54,140
Oh, I don't care!

2888
01:51:54,520 --> 01:51:55,740
I will kill you!

2889
01:51:58,620 --> 01:51:59,780
Oh my god.

2890
01:52:00,020 --> 01:52:01,020
Nice, I got the kill.

2891
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:03,240
I got the kill, guys.

2892
01:52:03,560 --> 01:52:04,440
That's all that matters.

2893
01:52:04,580 --> 01:52:05,240
Where is the sniper?

2894
01:52:05,240 --> 01:52:05,520
Where is the sniper girl?

2895
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:06,880
Where is she?

2896
01:52:07,820 --> 01:52:08,800
Where is she?

2897
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:11,040
You don't understand.

2898
01:52:11,880 --> 01:52:13,700
I went through so much today.

2899
01:52:13,960 --> 01:52:15,580
I went through...

2900
01:52:15,580 --> 01:52:19,840
I don't even care about the sniper lady.

2901
01:52:19,980 --> 01:52:21,040
I'll fucking kill her first.

2902
01:52:21,600 --> 01:52:23,660
Oh, you think you can get out of here?

2903
01:52:24,180 --> 01:52:27,120
You think you can snipe and be on the ground?

2904
01:52:27,560 --> 01:52:28,700
You think you can snipe and be on the ground?

2905
01:52:28,700 --> 01:52:29,320
Where are you?

2906
01:52:29,980 --> 01:52:31,100
Where the fuck...

2907
01:52:31,100 --> 01:52:31,700
Oh, hey there!

2908
01:52:31,700 --> 01:52:32,620
Hey!

2909
01:52:33,960 --> 01:52:35,020
Hey there!

2910
01:52:35,500 --> 01:52:36,680
Where did you go?

2911
01:52:37,480 --> 01:52:38,700
Where did you go?

2912
01:52:39,080 --> 01:52:40,300
Get over here!

2913
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:42,020
Get your ass over here!

2914
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:44,520
That's right.

2915
01:52:45,820 --> 01:52:47,200
That's fucking right.

2916
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:49,060
Oh hey, I got a staircase too.

2917
01:52:49,460 --> 01:52:50,820
Alright, so I made...

2918
01:52:50,820 --> 01:52:53,760
I made somebody plug for the first time.

2919
01:52:54,780 --> 01:52:55,780
That felt good.

2920
01:52:56,500 --> 01:52:57,200
That...

2921
01:52:57,200 --> 01:52:58,480
That felt...

2922
01:53:00,360 --> 01:53:01,060
Nice.

2923
01:53:01,640 --> 01:53:04,100
I actually made somebody plug, guys.

2924
01:53:05,740 --> 01:53:07,680
Two tower shots.

2925
01:53:08,460 --> 01:53:10,180
It do be like that.

2926
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:12,060
It's fine.

2927
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:13,400
It's fine.

2928
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:14,280
I'm not scared.

2929
01:53:14,580 --> 01:53:16,360
I feel so strong now.

2930
01:53:18,100 --> 01:53:19,620
I feel so powerful.

2931
01:53:20,860 --> 01:53:21,780
It's fine.

2932
01:53:22,160 --> 01:53:22,720
I...

2933
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:24,680
Are you powerful to yourself?

2934
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:26,380
Absolutely.

2935
01:53:27,480 --> 01:53:29,640
I am so fucking proud of myself.

2936
01:53:29,780 --> 01:53:30,340
You don't understand.

2937
01:53:31,060 --> 01:53:32,920
A monster was just born.

2938
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:35,820
Thank you, Abrams.

2939
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:36,880
Thank you, Surefour.

2940
01:53:39,240 --> 01:53:41,540
Thank you for showing me the way.

2941
01:53:43,300 --> 01:53:44,720
Alright, I gotta buy new items.

2942
01:53:45,500 --> 01:53:47,000
I really appreciate it.

2943
01:53:47,720 --> 01:53:49,460
Thank you for showing me the way.

2944
01:53:55,640 --> 01:54:00,320
One I figured...

2945
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:03,360
Once I found out what my actual hero was.

2946
01:54:03,680 --> 01:54:05,280
It was so over...

2947
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:06,020
It...

2948
01:54:06,020 --> 01:54:08,380
It was so over.

2949
01:54:09,210 --> 01:54:10,920
I figured out my characters.

2950
01:54:11,380 --> 01:54:13,640
Who needs Haze at this point.

2951
01:54:14,220 --> 01:54:16,300
Who the fuck needs Haze?

2952
01:54:16,300 --> 01:54:18,160
Guys, all I need is just a punch.

2953
01:54:19,200 --> 01:54:21,280
What have you done?

2954
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:24,340
Alright.

2955
01:54:24,340 --> 01:54:25,020
Zoom.

2956
01:54:26,040 --> 01:54:29,060
I don't even care about these small-ass minions.

2957
01:54:30,060 --> 01:54:31,460
Oh, I see you.

2958
01:54:31,580 --> 01:54:32,640
I see you.

2959
01:54:32,860 --> 01:54:33,120
Hey.

2960
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:34,480
Hey.

2961
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:35,680
Hey.

2962
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:39,480
Hey there, little guy.

2963
01:54:39,940 --> 01:54:40,620
Hey.

2964
01:54:42,120 --> 01:54:45,740
You think your little fire can stop me?

2965
01:54:47,200 --> 01:54:47,920
Yeah?

2966
01:54:48,680 --> 01:54:50,900
Oh, you got a friend?

2967
01:54:54,260 --> 01:54:55,760
Wait, what the fuck?

2968
01:54:57,020 --> 01:54:58,980
Yeah, was that your...

2969
01:55:00,020 --> 01:55:01,340
Was it worth it?

2970
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:02,880
That's right.

2971
01:55:03,220 --> 01:55:06,080
You thought your little friend could help you.

2972
01:55:07,820 --> 01:55:08,820
Too bad.

2973
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:10,440
Poor guys.

2974
01:55:10,740 --> 01:55:12,140
Poor little guys.

2975
01:55:13,160 --> 01:55:16,560
You thought his friend was gonna save him.

2976
01:55:19,840 --> 01:55:22,580
You took the haze away from me.

2977
01:55:22,660 --> 01:55:26,600
You took haze away from me and I will take your life now.

2978
01:55:26,860 --> 01:55:27,660
There you go.

2979
01:55:28,740 --> 01:55:31,620
It's causing other people misery.

2980
01:55:32,740 --> 01:55:34,660
She took haze away.

2981
01:55:35,900 --> 01:55:38,180
I wanted to play haze.

2982
01:55:38,700 --> 01:55:41,220
I wanted to play haze.

2983
01:55:47,080 --> 01:55:47,640
Please.

2984
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:49,480
And now I shall cause terror.

2985
01:55:50,040 --> 01:55:53,380
She did a favor taking haze away.

2986
01:55:54,580 --> 01:55:57,780
But I wanted to learn a new character.

2987
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:00,460
What am I getting hit by?

2988
01:56:00,740 --> 01:56:01,880
Like, what the fuck was that?

2989
01:56:06,040 --> 01:56:06,600
Alright.

2990
01:56:08,260 --> 01:56:09,020
It's fine.

2991
01:56:09,220 --> 01:56:10,040
I gotta reload.

2992
01:56:11,020 --> 01:56:11,580
Punch.

2993
01:56:11,660 --> 01:56:11,940
Oh, wait.

2994
01:56:12,140 --> 01:56:12,640
He's throwing me a punch.

2995
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:13,740
There we go.

2996
01:56:14,320 --> 01:56:15,460
Hey, get over here.

2997
01:56:15,860 --> 01:56:17,420
Get your ass over here.

2998
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:19,420
Get your...

2999
01:56:20,420 --> 01:56:22,160
Get your ass over here.

3000
01:56:24,820 --> 01:56:25,380
No.

3001
01:56:25,660 --> 01:56:26,640
Oh, no!

3002
01:56:28,040 --> 01:56:28,600
No!

3003
01:56:29,180 --> 01:56:30,540
That's so many people!

3004
01:56:32,020 --> 01:56:32,580
Help!

3005
01:56:32,580 --> 01:56:34,640
They're getting up on me!

3006
01:56:34,820 --> 01:56:35,820
They learned!

3007
01:56:36,680 --> 01:56:37,240
Okay.

3008
01:56:37,320 --> 01:56:37,840
That's fine.

3009
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:38,380
I escaped.

3010
01:56:39,480 --> 01:56:40,460
Oh, thank God.

3011
01:56:41,020 --> 01:56:42,040
Oh, thank God.

3012
01:56:42,140 --> 01:56:44,020
I almost... That was close.

3013
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:45,180
That was close.

3014
01:56:45,220 --> 01:56:46,080
That was like four of them.

3015
01:56:47,120 --> 01:56:51,020
They had to get all four of them together to fucking kill me.

3016
01:56:51,280 --> 01:56:52,060
That was scary.

3017
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:53,420
Oh, wait.

3018
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:54,300
I don't want that actually.

3019
01:56:54,480 --> 01:56:55,040
Destroy it.

3020
01:56:55,040 --> 01:56:55,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3021
01:56:55,860 --> 01:57:00,500
They had to get all four of them just to... just to take me down.

3022
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:01,680
But that's okay.

3023
01:57:01,720 --> 01:57:02,340
I'm coming back.

3024
01:57:02,820 --> 01:57:03,580
I'm fucking...

3025
01:57:03,580 --> 01:57:04,840
I'm coming back!

3026
01:57:10,780 --> 01:57:11,540
What?

3027
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:13,440
What was that actually?

3028
01:57:20,750 --> 01:57:22,250
What the fuck?

3029
01:57:24,010 --> 01:57:24,770
No!

3030
01:57:25,010 --> 01:57:25,990
I got beaten!

3031
01:57:26,770 --> 01:57:27,150
No!

3032
01:57:27,410 --> 01:57:28,210
That's fine.

3033
01:57:29,710 --> 01:57:30,690
That's fine.

3034
01:57:32,590 --> 01:57:33,650
That's fine.

3035
01:57:37,410 --> 01:57:38,390
That's fine.

3036
01:57:41,670 --> 01:57:46,130
You might have baited me, but I still got away, bitch.

3037
01:57:46,710 --> 01:57:48,170
I still got away.

3038
01:57:49,750 --> 01:57:50,790
It's that easy.

3039
01:57:52,350 --> 01:57:53,490
It's that easy.

3040
01:57:53,690 --> 01:57:54,210
Movement.

3041
01:57:54,910 --> 01:57:55,890
Fucking movement.

3042
01:57:56,130 --> 01:57:57,010
Too slippery.

3043
01:57:59,230 --> 01:58:01,270
They're now going together in packs.

3044
01:58:01,430 --> 01:58:02,110
That's cheating.

3045
01:58:02,830 --> 01:58:06,090
If I can 1v4 all of them, they should be able to.

3046
01:58:06,090 --> 01:58:08,210
Like, this is actually cheating.

3047
01:58:09,330 --> 01:58:10,590
This is fucked up.

3048
01:58:10,950 --> 01:58:12,910
This is actually so fucked up.

3049
01:58:14,350 --> 01:58:16,230
I can't believe it.

3050
01:58:16,250 --> 01:58:16,910
Those losers.

3051
01:58:19,190 --> 01:58:22,150
They're for... they're for sacking.

3052
01:58:22,770 --> 01:58:24,430
Oh, the patron's transforming!

3053
01:58:24,990 --> 01:58:26,070
I wanna be in!

3054
01:58:26,770 --> 01:58:27,810
Get me in there!

3055
01:58:29,130 --> 01:58:30,030
Oh my god.

3056
01:58:30,170 --> 01:58:30,990
I can't!

3057
01:58:32,710 --> 01:58:33,690
It's closed!

3058
01:58:34,590 --> 01:58:35,690
Oh, what the fuck?

3059
01:58:37,010 --> 01:58:37,790
They're closed!

3060
01:58:38,590 --> 01:58:39,450
Let me in!

3061
01:58:40,930 --> 01:58:41,770
Let me in!

3062
01:58:43,290 --> 01:58:44,150
Don't worry, I'm here.

3063
01:58:44,770 --> 01:58:45,530
I'm here now.

3064
01:58:45,650 --> 01:58:46,470
I'm here for the fight.

3065
01:58:49,210 --> 01:58:50,970
I'm here to join the fight, guys.

3066
01:58:52,270 --> 01:58:53,230
Wait, where are they?

3067
01:58:54,370 --> 01:58:56,890
Jesus Christ, what the fuck is hitting me?

3068
01:58:57,570 --> 01:58:58,630
Oh, back there.

3069
01:58:58,690 --> 01:58:59,990
Oh, there is these guys.

3070
01:59:04,270 --> 01:59:05,210
What's going on?

3071
01:59:05,410 --> 01:59:06,350
Like, what is that do?

3072
01:59:06,550 --> 01:59:07,290
I don't know.

3073
01:59:07,690 --> 01:59:09,090
Oh, that hurts me!

3074
01:59:09,190 --> 01:59:09,590
Okay.

3075
01:59:09,970 --> 01:59:11,270
I was so confused.

3076
01:59:12,150 --> 01:59:12,590
Like...

3077
01:59:14,010 --> 01:59:14,990
Wait, what?

3078
01:59:15,150 --> 01:59:15,870
I got tethered!

3079
01:59:15,990 --> 01:59:16,310
No!

3080
01:59:17,930 --> 01:59:19,370
I got tethered!

3081
01:59:20,810 --> 01:59:21,330
That's fucked.

3082
01:59:24,490 --> 01:59:25,410
That's so fucked.

3083
01:59:25,430 --> 01:59:26,190
I got tethered.

3084
01:59:28,610 --> 01:59:29,590
You gotta drop down.

3085
01:59:29,670 --> 01:59:30,450
You have to drop down.

3086
01:59:30,590 --> 01:59:32,290
You have to drop down, bitch.

3087
01:59:34,290 --> 01:59:35,150
You have to.

3088
01:59:35,170 --> 01:59:35,870
I know you do.

3089
01:59:37,350 --> 01:59:38,550
That's fucking right.

3090
01:59:39,930 --> 01:59:41,190
That's fucking right.

3091
01:59:42,030 --> 01:59:43,410
That's fucking right.

3092
01:59:45,830 --> 01:59:46,890
That's fucking right.

3093
01:59:47,270 --> 01:59:48,750
I knew you had to drop down.

3094
01:59:49,610 --> 01:59:51,250
You're not the lady I was fighting.

3095
01:59:51,450 --> 01:59:52,110
But I knew.

3096
01:59:54,250 --> 01:59:55,530
I fucking knew.

3097
01:59:55,670 --> 01:59:56,530
Oh, did you see that?

3098
01:59:56,610 --> 01:59:57,470
I killed all your friends.

3099
01:59:57,970 --> 01:59:59,690
I killed all your friends.

3100
01:59:59,750 --> 02:00:00,470
That's right.

3101
02:00:00,610 --> 02:00:01,450
Get over here.

3102
02:00:02,830 --> 02:00:04,190
You have to drop down.

3103
02:00:04,350 --> 02:00:05,670
You have to drop down.

3104
02:00:06,090 --> 02:00:06,990
Get down from the sky.

3105
02:00:07,490 --> 02:00:09,490
Oh, you're gonna... Okay, that's fine.

3106
02:00:09,570 --> 02:00:10,490
I'll fucking get your base.

3107
02:00:10,690 --> 02:00:11,530
I'll get your base then.

3108
02:00:18,090 --> 02:00:20,630
Fly away, you fucking coward!

3109
02:00:21,310 --> 02:00:23,030
You fucking coward!

3110
02:00:26,470 --> 02:00:27,770
I knew it.

3111
02:00:27,950 --> 02:00:30,990
You think I would let you do this to me?

3112
02:00:31,610 --> 02:00:34,230
You have to drop down soon early.

3113
02:00:35,670 --> 02:00:37,790
Get down from the sky.

3114
02:00:39,630 --> 02:00:41,030
You fucking bitch.

3115
02:00:44,570 --> 02:00:47,370
The only reason is...

3116
02:00:47,370 --> 02:00:48,630
Where is my teammate?

3117
02:00:49,450 --> 02:00:51,030
Like, where are they?

3118
02:00:51,410 --> 02:00:53,210
We literally got it.

3119
02:00:54,490 --> 02:00:56,510
And we all pushed together.

3120
02:00:56,930 --> 02:00:58,710
Now they all respawn.

3121
02:00:59,430 --> 02:01:00,870
This one sniper.

3122
02:01:01,010 --> 02:01:02,570
I can't get the sniper lady.

3123
02:01:02,630 --> 02:01:03,730
She's too fucking...

3124
02:01:04,270 --> 02:01:05,690
She's like in the sky.

3125
02:01:08,250 --> 02:01:10,030
I can't fist her.

3126
02:01:11,690 --> 02:01:14,470
Literally the one thing I can't do.

3127
02:01:17,870 --> 02:01:22,850
That's literally the one thing I couldn't do because she was in the sky.

3128
02:01:23,050 --> 02:01:23,730
It's not fair.

3129
02:01:24,090 --> 02:01:25,630
It's actually not fair.

3130
02:01:26,870 --> 02:01:28,190
It's so not fair.

3131
02:01:28,250 --> 02:01:29,010
I'm gonna start fisting.

3132
02:01:34,290 --> 02:01:34,950
Alright.

3133
02:01:34,950 --> 02:01:36,150
Give me your fucking...

3134
02:01:36,150 --> 02:01:36,330
Okay.

3135
02:01:37,310 --> 02:01:38,530
I'm fucking leaving.

3136
02:01:38,830 --> 02:01:41,090
I know when I have to leave.

3137
02:01:41,490 --> 02:01:44,110
I know when I have to go.

3138
02:01:44,870 --> 02:01:45,410
Wait.

3139
02:01:46,570 --> 02:01:47,890
That's fucking...

3140
02:01:47,890 --> 02:01:48,530
That's right.

3141
02:01:48,670 --> 02:01:49,230
No!

3142
02:01:50,570 --> 02:01:51,610
Get down!

3143
02:01:52,250 --> 02:01:58,750
Get your ass down here!

3144
02:01:59,210 --> 02:02:00,910
I'm gonna take my anger out from this guy.

3145
02:02:03,430 --> 02:02:05,450
I can't fucking get you down.

3146
02:02:05,570 --> 02:02:06,950
I'm taking my anger out of him.

3147
02:02:08,490 --> 02:02:08,990
Okay.

3148
02:02:09,570 --> 02:02:10,610
Where are you?

3149
02:02:11,310 --> 02:02:12,290
Where's the sniper?

3150
02:02:12,430 --> 02:02:14,770
You fucker.

3151
02:02:15,070 --> 02:02:16,090
That's fine.

3152
02:02:16,250 --> 02:02:17,690
I'll take my anger out on you!

3153
02:02:19,630 --> 02:02:20,130
Okay.

3154
02:02:20,210 --> 02:02:20,690
I can't anymore.

3155
02:02:20,910 --> 02:02:21,490
I'm just gonna...

3156
02:02:21,490 --> 02:02:23,150
This lady!

3157
02:02:24,670 --> 02:02:26,030
Zero damage guys!

3158
02:02:26,230 --> 02:02:26,530
Let's go!

3159
02:02:27,510 --> 02:02:28,490
Let's fucking go!

3160
02:02:28,870 --> 02:02:29,310
Yay!

3161
02:02:32,150 --> 02:02:32,810
Yay!

3162
02:02:35,670 --> 02:02:36,330
Yay!

3163
02:02:37,430 --> 02:02:38,090
Yay!

3164
02:02:38,670 --> 02:02:39,330
Yay!

3165
02:02:40,070 --> 02:02:40,730
Okay.

3166
02:02:40,850 --> 02:02:42,790
This guy was definitely learning the game.

3167
02:02:43,010 --> 02:02:43,670
Like...

3168
02:02:47,930 --> 02:02:49,170
Oh my God.

3169
02:02:51,010 --> 02:02:53,510
Their suffering ends finally.

3170
02:02:53,850 --> 02:02:56,590
Thank you for the five gift ships.

3171
02:02:56,850 --> 02:02:57,470
Thank you.

3172
02:02:57,510 --> 02:02:58,330
Thank you.

3173
02:02:58,550 --> 02:02:59,210
Look.

3174
02:02:59,330 --> 02:03:00,610
All I have to do is...

3175
02:03:00,910 --> 02:03:01,050
Okay.

3176
02:03:01,130 --> 02:03:01,690
Now!

3177
02:03:02,410 --> 02:03:04,370
Now I can play Haze!

3178
02:03:05,250 --> 02:03:07,390
Now give me Haze!

3179
02:03:07,970 --> 02:03:08,530
Okay.

3180
02:03:08,730 --> 02:03:10,290
Guys, I just wanna play Haze.

3181
02:03:10,290 --> 02:03:10,750
Like once.

3182
02:03:10,810 --> 02:03:11,750
That's all I want.

3183
02:03:11,870 --> 02:03:14,350
All it took was one baby and lane.

3184
02:03:18,030 --> 02:03:18,590
Navi!

3185
02:03:18,650 --> 02:03:20,310
Thank you for the five gift ships.

3186
02:03:20,610 --> 02:03:21,070
Thank you.

3187
02:03:21,090 --> 02:03:21,810
Thank you.

3188
02:03:22,630 --> 02:03:25,590
I swear to God if I don't get Haze... Yay!

3189
02:03:27,410 --> 02:03:28,990
I got Haze!

3190
02:03:28,990 --> 02:03:29,850
Let Zeki go!

3191
02:03:31,430 --> 02:03:31,990
All right.

3192
02:03:33,830 --> 02:03:34,270
Yay!

3193
02:03:36,690 --> 02:03:38,230
I can do Haze now!

3194
02:03:38,550 --> 02:03:38,710
I can do Haze now!

3195
02:03:38,710 --> 02:03:41,010
Shooter increases your bullet damage on that target.

3196
02:03:41,210 --> 02:03:42,590
Gain one stack per bullet.

3197
02:03:42,630 --> 02:03:44,010
Two if the hit is a headshot.

3198
02:03:44,370 --> 02:03:45,050
Oh, okay.

3199
02:03:46,310 --> 02:03:47,250
And then, all right.

3200
02:03:47,310 --> 02:03:48,110
Buying purple account.

3201
02:03:48,310 --> 02:03:48,610
Oh, yeah!

3202
02:03:48,690 --> 02:03:48,890
Yeah!

3203
02:03:49,030 --> 02:03:49,170
Yeah!

3204
02:03:49,530 --> 02:03:50,990
Surefour told me about it too.

3205
02:03:51,170 --> 02:03:52,570
I just keep forgetting to buy it.

3206
02:03:52,670 --> 02:03:53,850
Because I just auto buy.

3207
02:03:54,050 --> 02:03:54,930
I just like...

3208
02:03:55,450 --> 02:03:58,430
I just like, you know, autopilot when I'm buying stuff.

3209
02:03:58,770 --> 02:03:59,210
Navi!

3210
02:03:59,270 --> 02:04:00,230
Thank you for the super chat!

3211
02:04:00,290 --> 02:04:00,530
Thank you!

3212
02:04:00,570 --> 02:04:01,070
Thank you!

3213
02:04:01,070 --> 02:04:02,770
Good luck on your games!

3214
02:04:03,190 --> 02:04:03,670
Toki!

3215
02:04:03,990 --> 02:04:05,430
Thank you for the super chat!

3216
02:04:05,530 --> 02:04:05,850
Thank you!

3217
02:04:05,890 --> 02:04:06,490
Thank you!

3218
02:04:07,930 --> 02:04:09,290
Why everyone like Haze?

3219
02:04:09,330 --> 02:04:10,430
Apparently she's really strong.

3220
02:04:10,670 --> 02:04:13,670
If she has like... if she can farm really well.

3221
02:04:13,970 --> 02:04:15,330
Guys, please don't... please.

3222
02:04:15,530 --> 02:04:17,210
I hope my MMR is still okay.

3223
02:04:17,610 --> 02:04:20,050
I'm sorry for understanding the game now.

3224
02:04:20,250 --> 02:04:21,110
I hope...

3225
02:04:21,110 --> 02:04:22,130
Guys, please.

3226
02:04:22,590 --> 02:04:23,070
Please.

3227
02:04:23,310 --> 02:04:24,730
Give me noobs, please.

3228
02:04:24,730 --> 02:04:26,590
I'm still a baby.

3229
02:04:26,810 --> 02:04:28,530
I swear to god.

3230
02:04:28,590 --> 02:04:29,850
I'm still a baby.

3231
02:04:34,330 --> 02:04:34,930
Please.

3232
02:04:34,930 --> 02:04:35,530
Please.

3233
02:04:35,550 --> 02:04:37,130
It was just a fluke.

3234
02:04:37,570 --> 02:04:39,350
Abram was just a fluke.

3235
02:04:39,390 --> 02:04:39,910
I swear.

3236
02:04:40,070 --> 02:04:41,810
Please give me baby Loppy.

3237
02:04:44,730 --> 02:04:46,710
Why am I solo laning again?

3238
02:04:46,890 --> 02:04:47,210
Bro!

3239
02:04:47,470 --> 02:04:48,890
Are you fucking serious?

3240
02:04:49,630 --> 02:04:52,350
Why am I only solo laning?

3241
02:04:52,810 --> 02:04:54,630
This is fucking stupid.

3242
02:04:55,810 --> 02:04:57,690
They got seven... what was it?

3243
02:04:57,770 --> 02:05:00,410
Four games in a row I'm fucking solo laning.

3244
02:05:02,790 --> 02:05:04,090
It's not fair.

3245
02:05:07,650 --> 02:05:09,330
I have to shoot turrets?

3246
02:05:09,970 --> 02:05:10,350
Bro!

3247
02:05:10,470 --> 02:05:12,350
That person might as well...

3248
02:05:12,350 --> 02:05:12,790
Oh!

3249
02:05:12,910 --> 02:05:14,030
Just cause they do one?

3250
02:05:14,650 --> 02:05:15,510
This is not fair.

3251
02:05:15,590 --> 02:05:16,430
I need my solo queue.

3252
02:05:16,650 --> 02:05:19,430
I will have a solo queue and make friends in the game.

3253
02:05:19,670 --> 02:05:20,950
I can't believe it.

3254
02:05:21,070 --> 02:05:23,130
Solo lansers are for people with no friends.

3255
02:05:23,290 --> 02:05:24,170
This is fucked up.

3256
02:05:24,730 --> 02:05:25,490
I'm gonna report Valve.

3257
02:05:25,850 --> 02:05:27,830
I'm gonna send a complaint.

3258
02:05:31,050 --> 02:05:33,210
I can't believe it.

3259
02:05:33,330 --> 02:05:35,710
I can't fucking believe it.

3260
02:05:40,070 --> 02:05:41,310
Oh my God.

3261
02:05:42,190 --> 02:05:44,270
Report Valve to who?

3262
02:05:44,430 --> 02:05:46,210
To the federal government.

3263
02:05:48,110 --> 02:05:50,510
This is against my human rights.

3264
02:05:55,270 --> 02:06:04,890
I feel like solo queue should allow you to be able to duo lane and make friendships along the way.

3265
02:06:06,630 --> 02:06:11,070
It should not be given prioritized to people with friends.

3266
02:06:11,370 --> 02:06:16,470
It should let you be able to... Okay, let's see.

3267
02:06:16,570 --> 02:06:19,390
When does the farm stuff open up?

3268
02:06:20,510 --> 02:06:22,230
When do the triangles come up?

3269
02:06:23,990 --> 02:06:25,550
Competitive game only.

3270
02:06:25,750 --> 02:06:30,270
Why are non-solo lane reserved for people with friends?

3271
02:06:31,810 --> 02:06:33,030
That's all I'm saying.

3272
02:06:34,310 --> 02:06:36,690
They shouldn't be reserved for people with friends.

3273
02:06:38,910 --> 02:06:40,210
I swear to God.

3274
02:06:40,250 --> 02:06:41,990
You deny me my fucking farm.

3275
02:06:42,030 --> 02:06:42,730
I swear to God.

3276
02:06:44,450 --> 02:06:47,630
I'm gonna deny you.

3277
02:06:50,630 --> 02:06:51,150
What?

3278
02:06:52,310 --> 02:06:52,830
No.

3279
02:06:54,170 --> 02:06:55,330
I'm farming, guys.

3280
02:06:55,510 --> 02:06:56,610
Are you guys proud of me?

3281
02:06:56,690 --> 02:06:57,890
I'm trying to farm right now.

3282
02:06:59,190 --> 02:07:00,390
I'm trying to farm.

3283
02:07:04,300 --> 02:07:05,400
Alright, that's fine.

3284
02:07:07,420 --> 02:07:07,940
Okay.

3285
02:07:15,540 --> 02:07:17,840
I'm trying my best to farm, guys.

3286
02:07:18,240 --> 02:07:20,600
I need to train with coordination.

3287
02:07:20,920 --> 02:07:21,440
Okay.

3288
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:22,880
Have you ever seen a gun shooting?

3289
02:07:22,900 --> 02:07:24,220
I'm trying my best.

3290
02:07:24,500 --> 02:07:25,500
I'm farming.

3291
02:07:28,220 --> 02:07:29,440
Oh, God.

3292
02:07:29,560 --> 02:07:30,080
Okay, nice.

3293
02:07:31,920 --> 02:07:32,480
Headshot.

3294
02:07:32,560 --> 02:07:32,800
Yes.

3295
02:07:34,580 --> 02:07:35,140
Okay.

3296
02:07:35,340 --> 02:07:36,840
Our guy died already?

3297
02:07:37,060 --> 02:07:37,120
He

3298
02:07:40,790 --> 02:07:41,250
died already.

3299
02:07:41,650 --> 02:07:42,870
What the fuck?

3300
02:07:44,920 --> 02:07:46,180
What the fuck?

3301
02:07:46,540 --> 02:07:47,720
What did you do?

3302
02:07:51,980 --> 02:07:53,400
Oh, I missed a sleep.

3303
02:07:53,480 --> 02:07:53,960
I'm lucky.

3304
02:07:54,460 --> 02:07:56,200
Nah, I missed a sleep.

3305
02:07:57,020 --> 02:07:58,260
I'm so stupid.

3306
02:08:00,900 --> 02:08:02,540
I got too overzealous there.

3307
02:08:02,960 --> 02:08:04,000
He has a baby.

3308
02:08:04,100 --> 02:08:04,800
Where's my baby?

3309
02:08:04,820 --> 02:08:05,080
Where's my babies?

3310
02:08:06,980 --> 02:08:08,380
How am I supposed to farm?

3311
02:08:13,160 --> 02:08:14,220
Okay, there's creeps here.

3312
02:08:14,320 --> 02:08:14,620
Nice.

3313
02:08:18,320 --> 02:08:19,660
I need to farm, you guys.

3314
02:08:23,740 --> 02:08:24,420
Okay, nice.

3315
02:08:24,580 --> 02:08:25,400
Okay, I need to go.

3316
02:08:28,440 --> 02:08:29,340
Oh, my gosh.

3317
02:08:29,380 --> 02:08:30,460
I'm so baby, too.

3318
02:08:32,980 --> 02:08:33,400
Alright.

3319
02:08:33,520 --> 02:08:34,700
I need to go to the shop.

3320
02:08:36,560 --> 02:08:37,260
Shop, please.

3321
02:08:38,580 --> 02:08:39,000
Okay.

3322
02:08:41,440 --> 02:08:42,200
That's fine.

3323
02:08:42,920 --> 02:08:43,700
That's fine.

3324
02:08:46,020 --> 02:08:46,920
Yeah, but...

3325
02:08:46,920 --> 02:08:49,500
It's not the same punching with this lady.

3326
02:08:51,740 --> 02:08:52,260
Wow!

3327
02:08:52,260 --> 02:08:52,780
Shit!

3328
02:08:54,220 --> 02:08:57,080
I was not expecting her to shoot me.

3329
02:08:57,120 --> 02:08:57,940
Holy shit.

3330
02:08:58,180 --> 02:09:00,220
That scared the shit out of me.

3331
02:09:00,320 --> 02:09:01,140
Not gonna lie.

3332
02:09:01,540 --> 02:09:03,180
I was not expecting it.

3333
02:09:03,340 --> 02:09:04,900
I was like, what the fuck?

3334
02:09:04,980 --> 02:09:06,080
Where did you come from?

3335
02:09:08,160 --> 02:09:10,300
Where the fuck did you come from?

3336
02:09:10,300 --> 02:09:10,660
Where did you come from?

3337
02:09:14,260 --> 02:09:15,740
Oh, unlucky for me.

3338
02:09:15,820 --> 02:09:16,720
I might have to leave.

3339
02:09:18,540 --> 02:09:19,760
I need to go back.

3340
02:09:22,700 --> 02:09:23,460
Oh, don't.

3341
02:09:23,460 --> 02:09:24,100
Don't hit that.

3342
02:09:25,800 --> 02:09:26,680
Don't Kovacs.

3343
02:09:26,940 --> 02:09:28,120
Don't you dare Kovacs.

3344
02:09:28,280 --> 02:09:29,180
Oh, I might need to go.

3345
02:09:29,720 --> 02:09:30,540
I'm gonna go.

3346
02:09:31,480 --> 02:09:31,920
No!

3347
02:09:32,680 --> 02:09:33,120
No!

3348
02:09:33,160 --> 02:09:33,800
No more dash!

3349
02:09:35,800 --> 02:09:36,660
Get over there!

3350
02:09:36,760 --> 02:09:37,500
Okay, thank god.

3351
02:09:38,160 --> 02:09:38,720
Alright.

3352
02:09:39,780 --> 02:09:40,840
I have to...

3353
02:09:40,840 --> 02:09:41,800
I have to go back.

3354
02:09:43,440 --> 02:09:44,000
No!

3355
02:09:44,780 --> 02:09:46,620
I need to farm more!

3356
02:09:48,420 --> 02:09:48,980
Fucking...

3357
02:09:48,980 --> 02:09:49,560
Okay, you're right.

3358
02:09:49,700 --> 02:09:50,180
Farming sucks.

3359
02:09:53,560 --> 02:09:55,420
I fucking hate farming.

3360
02:09:59,540 --> 02:10:01,640
Farming fucking sucks, guys.

3361
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:03,540
HAHAHAHA.

3362
02:10:05,660 --> 02:10:07,220
You guys were right.

3363
02:10:07,460 --> 02:10:10,100
You guys were right.

3364
02:10:11,060 --> 02:10:11,720
You guys were right.

3365
02:10:11,720 --> 02:10:13,460
I can't believe you guys were right.

3366
02:10:15,370 --> 02:10:16,560
Farming is not fun.

3367
02:10:23,270 --> 02:10:24,940
Farming is not fun, guys.

3368
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:28,460
That's fucking right.

3369
02:10:28,640 --> 02:10:30,780
Oh, come on.

3370
02:10:35,520 --> 02:10:37,520
No way, you fucker!

3371
02:10:41,480 --> 02:10:42,440
You fucker!

3372
02:10:42,480 --> 02:10:43,720
You were so low!

3373
02:10:47,440 --> 02:10:49,460
I was so close too.

3374
02:10:50,540 --> 02:10:52,140
I was gonna punch as well.

3375
02:10:52,260 --> 02:10:53,220
I was gonna punch!

3376
02:10:53,320 --> 02:10:54,220
You guys saw that?

3377
02:10:54,480 --> 02:10:56,360
I almost punched!

3378
02:10:57,920 --> 02:11:01,440
And then he ran away like a little bitch!

3379
02:11:01,440 --> 02:11:01,700
Bitch!

3380
02:11:04,860 --> 02:11:06,640
I can't believe it.

3381
02:11:06,700 --> 02:11:08,360
I actually was gonna punch too.

3382
02:11:08,700 --> 02:11:09,780
I was ready.

3383
02:11:09,880 --> 02:11:10,960
I was right in it.

3384
02:11:11,100 --> 02:11:12,200
I was so ready.

3385
02:11:12,280 --> 02:11:13,220
I think my team's bad.

3386
02:11:13,460 --> 02:11:25,520
I'm looking at the farm and the enemy team is like 1000 and then my team is like fucking not even breaking 1k.

3387
02:11:26,200 --> 02:11:26,960
Guys, I'm learning!

3388
02:11:27,080 --> 02:11:28,040
Are you proud of me?

3389
02:11:28,060 --> 02:11:29,140
I'm actually learning!

3390
02:11:29,980 --> 02:11:31,100
Holy fuck!

3391
02:11:31,440 --> 02:11:32,720
What happened?

3392
02:11:36,180 --> 02:11:37,200
Oh my god.

3393
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:41,860
She's just like me when I didn't know what the fuck was going on.

3394
02:11:43,680 --> 02:11:47,960
The what's-her-name-the-vindicta is just like me when I was confused too.

3395
02:11:49,060 --> 02:11:50,520
She's just like me.

3396
02:11:51,160 --> 02:11:52,740
I was just like you.

3397
02:11:54,320 --> 02:11:56,180
I was just like you.

3398
02:11:57,260 --> 02:12:00,720
Confused and wondering what the fuck was going on.

3399
02:12:03,240 --> 02:12:03,780
Wait, what?

3400
02:12:04,560 --> 02:12:05,280
What did I do?

3401
02:12:05,360 --> 02:12:06,340
Oh, I... that was an accident.

3402
02:12:06,540 --> 02:12:06,860
Whoops.

3403
02:12:07,600 --> 02:12:10,080
I just need... it's... he's almost... he's literally one.

3404
02:12:10,380 --> 02:12:10,740
Yes!

3405
02:12:13,960 --> 02:12:15,100
Nice, I got some farm.

3406
02:12:15,960 --> 02:12:16,460
That's good.

3407
02:12:18,420 --> 02:12:18,940
That's good.

3408
02:12:20,940 --> 02:12:21,300
Okay.

3409
02:12:24,200 --> 02:12:25,120
Wait, what the fuck?

3410
02:12:25,260 --> 02:12:28,740
Okay, is there any... any items for me to pick up?

3411
02:12:31,100 --> 02:12:32,120
This is bad.

3412
02:12:32,300 --> 02:12:34,280
Wait, how is she like so ahead of me?

3413
02:12:35,080 --> 02:12:37,020
Oh, cause she left the lane.

3414
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:38,820
Fucking coward!

3415
02:12:41,500 --> 02:12:42,200
Actual coward!

3416
02:12:42,480 --> 02:12:44,200
You don't just leave the lane!

3417
02:12:45,180 --> 02:12:46,100
You commit!

3418
02:12:49,520 --> 02:12:50,840
Oh god, grandpa needs help.

3419
02:12:51,080 --> 02:12:52,000
Don't worry, grandpa!

3420
02:12:56,640 --> 02:12:58,740
Don't worry, I'm gonna steal your creep too!

3421
02:12:59,180 --> 02:12:59,580
Hahaha!

3422
02:13:00,820 --> 02:13:01,880
Don't worry, grandpa!

3423
02:13:01,880 --> 02:13:02,320
Grandpa, I'm here!

3424
02:13:05,540 --> 02:13:06,140
Don't worry!

3425
02:13:09,880 --> 02:13:10,320
Hahaha!

3426
02:13:10,320 --> 02:13:11,660
Thanks, grandpa, for the creep.

3427
02:13:11,900 --> 02:13:12,520
Thank you.

3428
02:13:14,660 --> 02:13:15,900
You're welcome, grandpa.

3429
02:13:16,480 --> 02:13:16,920
You're...

3430
02:13:19,060 --> 02:13:19,740
You're welcome.

3431
02:13:25,160 --> 02:13:25,600
Okay.

3432
02:13:25,720 --> 02:13:26,820
That was a good sleep though.

3433
02:13:26,880 --> 02:13:27,380
I did that.

3434
02:13:28,580 --> 02:13:29,460
You guys see that?

3435
02:13:29,700 --> 02:13:30,600
I did that.

3436
02:13:30,820 --> 02:13:31,960
Oh, I have Reaper now.

3437
02:13:32,820 --> 02:13:33,260
Nice.

3438
02:13:33,260 --> 02:13:33,420
Nice.

3439
02:13:33,440 --> 02:13:34,780
Oh, I want this creep!

3440
02:13:34,920 --> 02:13:35,540
I want these!

3441
02:13:36,740 --> 02:13:37,980
Am I strong enough for this?

3442
02:13:38,060 --> 02:13:38,900
I am not strong enough.

3443
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:39,160
Whoops.

3444
02:13:39,600 --> 02:13:40,040
JK.

3445
02:13:41,020 --> 02:13:41,460
JK.

3446
02:13:42,420 --> 02:13:44,060
Guys, I want the...

3447
02:13:44,060 --> 02:13:44,680
Oh, wait.

3448
02:13:44,860 --> 02:13:45,980
Where's the baby ones?

3449
02:13:46,720 --> 02:13:48,640
Wait, did he already use farm the babies?

3450
02:13:52,460 --> 02:13:53,840
Okay, we're sharing lanes now.

3451
02:13:54,200 --> 02:13:54,960
Oh shit!

3452
02:13:55,100 --> 02:13:55,660
I leave!

3453
02:13:56,500 --> 02:13:56,940
Nevermind!

3454
02:13:57,880 --> 02:13:59,300
I need lifesteal, you're right.

3455
02:13:59,740 --> 02:14:00,760
I need lifesteal.

3456
02:14:02,020 --> 02:14:02,760
I'm sorry!

3457
02:14:02,940 --> 02:14:04,080
I was so overzealous!

3458
02:14:07,960 --> 02:14:09,080
I was so happy!

3459
02:14:10,540 --> 02:14:10,960
Okay.

3460
02:14:12,260 --> 02:14:12,680
Nice.

3461
02:14:12,740 --> 02:14:12,940
Alright.

3462
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:17,340
Oh, where's lifesteal?

3463
02:14:18,200 --> 02:14:18,960
Where is it?

3464
02:14:19,120 --> 02:14:19,540
Okay.

3465
02:14:20,820 --> 02:14:21,480
There you go.

3466
02:14:21,560 --> 02:14:23,180
We're at early game now, I think.

3467
02:14:25,240 --> 02:14:25,660
Whoa!

3468
02:14:28,480 --> 02:14:29,780
Lane until 10 minutes?

3469
02:14:29,920 --> 02:14:30,440
Is it not 10?

3470
02:14:30,540 --> 02:14:31,060
It's not 10.

3471
02:14:31,500 --> 02:14:32,080
It's not.

3472
02:14:37,260 --> 02:14:38,380
I'm sorry.

3473
02:14:38,820 --> 02:14:39,380
I'm sorry.

3474
02:14:39,380 --> 02:14:39,580
I'm sorry.

3475
02:14:39,580 --> 02:14:39,740
I'm sorry.

3476
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:41,560
I'm sorry.

3477
02:14:41,740 --> 02:14:43,300
I didn't realize it's not yet.

3478
02:14:43,920 --> 02:14:44,480
Whoopsie.

3479
02:14:47,340 --> 02:14:52,320
Guys, I don't know what's considered early game and what's considered like the right game.

3480
02:14:54,820 --> 02:14:55,940
Actually don't know.

3481
02:14:56,040 --> 02:14:57,600
I'm just buying stuff in order.

3482
02:14:58,400 --> 02:15:02,060
I'm literally buying stuff in order.

3483
02:15:02,060 --> 02:15:03,780
I'm gonna help her.

3484
02:15:03,920 --> 02:15:05,400
Fucking sniper lady.

3485
02:15:06,780 --> 02:15:07,380
Vindicta?

3486
02:15:07,380 --> 02:15:10,640
She's having a very rough- Oh wait, but I wanna farm this actually.

3487
02:15:15,080 --> 02:15:16,280
Give me.

3488
02:15:16,600 --> 02:15:17,260
Give me.

3489
02:15:17,680 --> 02:15:19,740
I know how it feels, Vindicta.

3490
02:15:19,920 --> 02:15:21,500
I was just like you.

3491
02:15:21,820 --> 02:15:26,720
I was just like you, feet lady, when I was forced to play that character.

3492
02:15:27,020 --> 02:15:28,640
And I was so confused.

3493
02:15:29,220 --> 02:15:31,120
I was just like you.

3494
02:15:31,120 --> 02:15:31,980
Don't worry.

3495
02:15:32,400 --> 02:15:34,760
I know how it feels too.

3496
02:15:36,600 --> 02:15:37,380
Don't worry.

3497
02:15:38,860 --> 02:15:42,380
I know how it feels to be so confused.

3498
02:15:42,960 --> 02:15:44,500
What the fuck?

3499
02:15:44,580 --> 02:15:46,580
How fucking tanky are they?

3500
02:15:48,020 --> 02:15:50,840
Oh my- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3501
02:15:51,860 --> 02:15:54,500
Okay, I didn't realize they were that tanky, guys.

3502
02:15:54,920 --> 02:15:59,360
I got- Oh my god.

3503
02:15:59,520 --> 02:16:00,940
I think I got a bug.

3504
02:16:01,120 --> 02:16:02,500
I think my game was like, no.

3505
02:16:06,780 --> 02:16:07,380
Shit.

3506
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:13,740
I guess the game was like, what the fuck are you doing?

3507
02:16:15,940 --> 02:16:16,840
I'm sorry.

3508
02:16:19,140 --> 02:16:22,100
That was my bad.

3509
02:16:22,600 --> 02:16:23,760
I don't know why.

3510
02:16:24,840 --> 02:16:27,860
I don't know why I thought that was a good idea.

3511
02:16:27,860 --> 02:16:33,880
Oh, that was absolutely- was not a good idea at all.

3512
02:16:38,260 --> 02:16:39,500
Oh my god.

3513
02:16:41,160 --> 02:16:42,200
Nice, I got him.

3514
02:16:42,500 --> 02:16:43,460
Okay, that's good.

3515
02:16:44,040 --> 02:16:46,420
That's good the Inferno came over for me.

3516
02:16:46,560 --> 02:16:47,140
Thank god.

3517
02:16:48,560 --> 02:16:49,720
Oh, thank god.

3518
02:16:52,640 --> 02:16:54,440
Your ult is on me.

3519
02:16:54,880 --> 02:16:55,440
Yeah.

3520
02:16:55,440 --> 02:16:59,720
Yeah, I figured- I figured it was a 1v1 scenario after that.

3521
02:17:00,860 --> 02:17:02,500
I was like, it's just like Reaper.

3522
02:17:03,460 --> 02:17:05,920
In my head, I was like, it's just like Reaper.

3523
02:17:06,300 --> 02:17:10,400
All I do is just go right in and then be like, die, die, die.

3524
02:17:10,520 --> 02:17:12,380
And then we fucking GG's.

3525
02:17:12,780 --> 02:17:14,480
It was not just like Reaper, guys.

3526
02:17:15,380 --> 02:17:17,900
It was absolutely not just like Reaper.

3527
02:17:18,320 --> 02:17:20,900
What the f- Okay, that's fine.

3528
02:17:23,880 --> 02:17:25,260
Like, I mean, we got it.

3529
02:17:26,040 --> 02:17:27,180
That's all that matters, right?

3530
02:17:28,100 --> 02:17:29,480
We literally got it, so.

3531
02:17:29,600 --> 02:17:30,880
Okay, I need you guys to go in.

3532
02:17:31,740 --> 02:17:33,180
I need you guys to go in for me.

3533
02:17:34,280 --> 02:17:37,960
Because like- Because like, they're- they're doing so much damage.

3534
02:17:38,440 --> 02:17:40,540
Oh wait, picking up unsecured souls?

3535
02:17:40,780 --> 02:17:41,600
The fuck does that mean?

3536
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:45,520
Oh wait.

3537
02:17:50,010 --> 02:17:50,550
Sleepy time!

3538
02:17:51,290 --> 02:17:51,850
Sleepy time!

3539
02:17:53,390 --> 02:17:54,250
That's fucking right!

3540
02:17:54,290 --> 02:17:54,890
Sleepy time!

3541
02:17:55,670 --> 02:17:56,770
That's fucking right!

3542
02:17:57,710 --> 02:17:58,590
Oh shit!

3543
02:17:58,830 --> 02:17:59,550
Sleepy time!

3544
02:18:03,110 --> 02:18:03,550
Yay!

3545
02:18:05,590 --> 02:18:06,030
Sleepy!

3546
02:18:09,170 --> 02:18:10,210
Oh, I can do it again.

3547
02:18:10,390 --> 02:18:11,330
Guys, this time it'll work.

3548
02:18:15,520 --> 02:18:17,200
This time it's gonna work, guys.

3549
02:18:17,280 --> 02:18:17,860
Trust me.

3550
02:18:18,080 --> 02:18:19,040
Wait, he doesn't know.

3551
02:18:22,160 --> 02:18:24,020
Guys, it- I don't know why.

3552
02:18:24,500 --> 02:18:25,040
This time it'll work.

3553
02:18:30,060 --> 02:18:30,620
Okay.

3554
02:18:32,680 --> 02:18:34,000
Okay, it did not work.

3555
02:18:38,540 --> 02:18:40,660
I thought- I thought I'd be different!

3556
02:18:44,900 --> 02:18:45,460
Okay.

3557
02:18:46,920 --> 02:18:48,300
Okay, guys, watch this.

3558
02:18:49,520 --> 02:18:50,080
Okay.

3559
02:18:51,580 --> 02:18:53,160
Okay, now we know.

3560
02:18:54,220 --> 02:18:55,400
Now we know.

3561
02:18:56,330 --> 02:18:56,980
Now we know.

3562
02:18:57,100 --> 02:18:59,600
It's about sending a message chat.

3563
02:18:59,920 --> 02:19:02,880
I wanted to send a message, guys.

3564
02:19:04,540 --> 02:19:06,600
That like, I ain't afraid.

3565
02:19:07,200 --> 02:19:09,100
Oh shit, I'm afraid.

3566
02:19:09,340 --> 02:19:11,620
Oh my god, that's a lot of people.

3567
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:13,900
Okay, I'm a little afraid there.

3568
02:19:14,460 --> 02:19:17,700
Actually, I'm a little afraid.

3569
02:19:17,760 --> 02:19:18,420
That's a lot.

3570
02:19:18,580 --> 02:19:19,860
What the fuck?

3571
02:19:19,920 --> 02:19:22,660
That's a lot of people over there.

3572
02:19:29,540 --> 02:19:31,340
Oh my god, what is he trying to do?

3573
02:19:34,200 --> 02:19:36,240
Oh shit, I didn't realize I was so low!

3574
02:19:37,800 --> 02:19:38,240
Woo!

3575
02:19:39,260 --> 02:19:40,140
Haha, bitch!

3576
02:19:41,260 --> 02:19:42,520
My teammate died!

3577
02:19:44,660 --> 02:19:47,220
My teammate died, but I'm okay.

3578
02:19:48,740 --> 02:19:49,700
Guys, it's okay.

3579
02:19:49,780 --> 02:19:50,240
I'm okay.

3580
02:19:50,740 --> 02:19:51,340
Wait, what?

3581
02:19:51,400 --> 02:19:51,820
Where am I?

3582
02:19:52,020 --> 02:19:53,520
Oh, I- whoops.

3583
02:19:54,460 --> 02:19:55,100
It's okay.

3584
02:19:55,240 --> 02:19:56,960
My teammate's dead, but it's okay.

3585
02:19:57,160 --> 02:19:58,540
What do I get for this, though?

3586
02:19:58,940 --> 02:19:59,440
I don't know.

3587
02:19:59,440 --> 02:19:59,760
I don't know.

3588
02:20:00,100 --> 02:20:01,120
Okay, bullet resistance?

3589
02:20:02,280 --> 02:20:03,960
Guys, I don't think we're- I think we're gonna lose.

3590
02:20:04,200 --> 02:20:05,080
I think this is my first loss.

3591
02:20:08,480 --> 02:20:09,660
It wasn't me though.

3592
02:20:09,720 --> 02:20:10,520
I'm not the problem.

3593
02:20:10,660 --> 02:20:12,340
I don't think I'm the problem here.

3594
02:20:14,920 --> 02:20:17,880
I don't think it was me.

3595
02:20:18,100 --> 02:20:22,200
I was definitely not the issue here.

3596
02:20:25,220 --> 02:20:25,860
There we go.

3597
02:20:26,240 --> 02:20:29,020
I was doing the best I could in that situation.

3598
02:20:29,020 --> 02:20:29,400
This was the third one.

3599
02:20:29,600 --> 02:20:32,160
Like, maybe if I...

3600
02:20:32,160 --> 02:20:41,040
Okay, honestly, the only thing that I think maybe I should of done differently is that maybe I should not have ulted like that.

3601
02:20:41,240 --> 02:20:41,820
Like...

3602
02:20:47,280 --> 02:20:50,280
That's the only thing I could think of differently...

3603
02:20:50,280 --> 02:20:51,180
No!

3604
02:20:54,200 --> 02:20:55,400
I can't!

3605
02:20:55,400 --> 02:20:57,260
I just got the cool down!

3606
02:20:59,780 --> 02:21:01,540
Okay, I couldn't!

3607
02:21:01,540 --> 02:21:04,820
I literally just- the cool down literally just showed up!

3608
02:21:05,040 --> 02:21:06,060
But it's not me.

3609
02:21:06,160 --> 02:21:07,340
I'm not the issue here.

3610
02:21:07,440 --> 02:21:09,540
Like I'm literally like in the right.

3611
02:21:10,500 --> 02:21:12,180
I'm not the problem.

3612
02:21:12,420 --> 02:21:14,140
I know I'm not the problem.

3613
02:21:14,320 --> 02:21:16,440
I literally have the smallest KDA.

3614
02:21:22,320 --> 02:21:24,180
I know I'm not the issue.

3615
02:21:24,340 --> 02:21:24,860
Okay guys.

3616
02:21:26,020 --> 02:21:30,440
I figured out that I am most definitely an Abram player.

3617
02:21:32,040 --> 02:21:38,860
After everything I went- after trying all these characters, I know who I'm like most like best for.

3618
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:40,160
Oh shit!

3619
02:21:41,540 --> 02:21:47,600
I know which character I'm- Never leave Abram.

3620
02:21:47,720 --> 02:21:53,180
Yeah, I know that I cannot leave Abram.

3621
02:21:54,360 --> 02:21:55,580
Abram was the key.

3622
02:21:56,620 --> 02:21:58,620
Abram was literally the key to success.

3623
02:22:00,520 --> 02:22:01,660
Oh my god.

3624
02:22:02,600 --> 02:22:03,120
Okay.

3625
02:22:04,660 --> 02:22:05,800
Wow, where is he?

3626
02:22:06,840 --> 02:22:07,960
Oh nice, okay.

3627
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:12,100
Abram was the key.

3628
02:22:13,940 --> 02:22:15,920
Without Abram, we wouldn't win.

3629
02:22:18,200 --> 02:22:20,500
There's like a guy here, I think?

3630
02:22:21,060 --> 02:22:23,160
He was like- Where was he?

3631
02:22:23,160 --> 02:22:23,760
Is he lurking?

3632
02:22:26,820 --> 02:22:28,660
I thought I saw somebody here.

3633
02:22:28,900 --> 02:22:29,420
Oh well.

3634
02:22:30,740 --> 02:22:31,520
I don't know.

3635
02:22:34,280 --> 02:22:35,240
Get over here.

3636
02:22:35,660 --> 02:22:36,720
I'm farming!

3637
02:22:36,900 --> 02:22:38,720
I'm farming as fast as I could!

3638
02:22:39,400 --> 02:22:40,820
Oh, not that fast.

3639
02:22:42,700 --> 02:22:43,260
Okay.

3640
02:22:44,280 --> 02:22:47,120
Technically, I am not farming as fast as I could.

3641
02:22:47,200 --> 02:22:48,920
Guys, I am...

3642
02:22:50,560 --> 02:22:52,060
I was not...

3643
02:22:53,600 --> 02:22:54,080
I was not...

3644
02:22:54,080 --> 02:22:54,320
Don't worry.

3645
02:22:54,400 --> 02:22:55,080
Now I am!

3646
02:22:57,760 --> 02:22:58,720
Holy shit.

3647
02:22:58,800 --> 02:22:59,520
That's a lot of people!

3648
02:23:00,200 --> 02:23:01,180
I'm fucking leaving.

3649
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:02,960
I'm like...

3650
02:23:04,900 --> 02:23:05,380
Right!

3651
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,340
Okay, it's okay.

3652
02:23:11,480 --> 02:23:12,180
It's okay.

3653
02:23:12,420 --> 02:23:13,460
Don't worry, teammate!

3654
02:23:13,620 --> 02:23:14,220
Don't worry, Grandpa!

3655
02:23:15,220 --> 02:23:15,700
Oh.

3656
02:23:15,920 --> 02:23:16,400
Nice.

3657
02:23:16,460 --> 02:23:16,760
Okay.

3658
02:23:17,260 --> 02:23:17,840
Don't worry!

3659
02:23:19,200 --> 02:23:19,680
Whoa.

3660
02:23:20,580 --> 02:23:21,860
Don't worry, Grandpa!

3661
02:23:21,940 --> 02:23:22,040
Don't worry, Grandpa!

3662
02:23:22,660 --> 02:23:23,420
Grandpa's dead.

3663
02:23:24,240 --> 02:23:24,960
Grandpa's dead.

3664
02:23:25,180 --> 02:23:25,900
Grandpa's dead.

3665
02:23:27,600 --> 02:23:28,460
I'm worrying.

3666
02:23:29,180 --> 02:23:29,920
Grandpa's dead.

3667
02:23:30,260 --> 02:23:31,160
I'm worrying.

3668
02:23:34,740 --> 02:23:35,680
Grandpa's dead.

3669
02:23:37,320 --> 02:23:39,360
Grandpa's so fucking dead, guys.

3670
02:23:41,680 --> 02:23:42,240
Okay.

3671
02:23:43,340 --> 02:23:45,360
But I wasn't the issue, at least.

3672
02:23:45,460 --> 02:23:47,700
At least we know it wasn't me.

3673
02:23:48,040 --> 02:23:49,600
He dodged it?

3674
02:23:50,800 --> 02:23:52,240
That's fucking cheating!

3675
02:23:53,200 --> 02:23:55,100
Guys, I think I might lose my first game.

3676
02:23:55,460 --> 02:23:57,680
I think I might...

3677
02:23:59,700 --> 02:24:01,920
Guys, I think it's over.

3678
02:24:02,420 --> 02:24:04,800
I think it's over.

3679
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:07,340
Guys, we're supposed to...

3680
02:24:07,340 --> 02:24:08,820
I don't even have Ricochet yet.

3681
02:24:09,840 --> 02:24:11,580
My team is struggling.

3682
02:24:15,600 --> 02:24:18,260
My team is having a bad time!

3683
02:24:19,600 --> 02:24:21,480
And it's so understandable!

3684
02:24:22,220 --> 02:24:23,320
And it's so understandable!

3685
02:24:23,320 --> 02:24:24,300
Oh, shit!

3686
02:24:24,460 --> 02:24:26,640
It's B-bomb time!

3687
02:24:29,260 --> 02:24:30,680
That's fucking right.

3688
02:24:30,740 --> 02:24:32,060
I learned about sleep.

3689
02:24:32,480 --> 02:24:33,880
That's fucking right!

3690
02:24:34,760 --> 02:24:37,300
I learned about how to do it!

3691
02:24:37,540 --> 02:24:38,620
It worked!

3692
02:24:39,380 --> 02:24:40,660
Guys, it's fine.

3693
02:24:40,760 --> 02:24:44,720
Even if we lose, we made our first successful...

3694
02:24:47,720 --> 02:24:49,980
Our very first...

3695
02:24:51,880 --> 02:24:53,740
Our very first ult, guys.

3696
02:24:53,840 --> 02:24:54,580
That's all that matters.

3697
02:24:56,920 --> 02:24:58,700
We got our very first ult.

3698
02:24:58,860 --> 02:24:59,820
That's all that matters.

3699
02:25:00,800 --> 02:25:03,260
That's literally all that matters.

3700
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:06,580
Oh my god.

3701
02:25:06,800 --> 02:25:08,840
Please, I need Ricochet.

3702
02:25:08,920 --> 02:25:09,400
Please!

3703
02:25:09,880 --> 02:25:13,280
That's literally the only reason to play her apparently.

3704
02:25:14,100 --> 02:25:16,680
But I can't even afford it!

3705
02:25:19,080 --> 02:25:20,360
But I can't even afford it!

3706
02:25:20,360 --> 02:25:21,880
I can't even afford it!

3707
02:25:21,960 --> 02:25:22,800
I'm so poor!

3708
02:25:25,660 --> 02:25:26,500
Oh my god.

3709
02:25:26,520 --> 02:25:27,120
Where did she go?

3710
02:25:30,540 --> 02:25:31,840
She fucking... Okay.

3711
02:25:32,020 --> 02:25:32,720
That's not fair.

3712
02:25:33,480 --> 02:25:35,120
That is also not fair.

3713
02:25:35,300 --> 02:25:35,640
Wow!

3714
02:25:35,900 --> 02:25:36,460
Goodbye!

3715
02:25:37,320 --> 02:25:37,880
Ah!

3716
02:25:37,880 --> 02:25:38,440
Goodbye!

3717
02:25:38,760 --> 02:25:39,320
Ah!

3718
02:25:39,380 --> 02:25:39,880
Goodbye!

3719
02:25:39,880 --> 02:25:40,540
Hahaha!

3720
02:25:41,620 --> 02:25:42,220
Hahaha!

3721
02:25:43,140 --> 02:25:45,080
At least you learned.

3722
02:25:45,840 --> 02:25:47,860
We didn't farm enough!

3723
02:25:48,720 --> 02:25:52,100
We weren't even the worst farmers in our team!

3724
02:25:54,800 --> 02:25:55,800
Oh my god.

3725
02:25:55,920 --> 02:25:58,020
I'm so... I don't even... I'm not even close!

3726
02:25:58,620 --> 02:25:59,560
I'm not...

3727
02:26:00,520 --> 02:26:03,020
Good job finding the enemy team.

3728
02:26:04,220 --> 02:26:06,680
Guys, I think it's over.

3729
02:26:06,920 --> 02:26:13,480
I think there was definitely a dead weight and it's not There's a dead weight here.

3730
02:26:13,600 --> 02:26:15,780
And I know for sure it was not me.

3731
02:26:15,900 --> 02:26:17,220
I know for sure.

3732
02:26:21,960 --> 02:26:22,500
It's...

3733
02:26:23,580 --> 02:26:25,620
There's no way it's high elo!

3734
02:26:25,740 --> 02:26:26,980
Look at the splice!

3735
02:26:27,040 --> 02:26:27,860
I missed...

3736
02:26:27,860 --> 02:26:28,860
I missed the baby.

3737
02:26:30,260 --> 02:26:31,740
I missed the baby.

3738
02:26:31,820 --> 02:26:33,620
No wonder people in League always smurf.

3739
02:26:34,140 --> 02:26:35,760
Makes so much more sense now.

3740
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:43,060
Now I understand why people smurf in this game.

3741
02:26:43,580 --> 02:26:45,360
Now I understand.

3742
02:26:46,060 --> 02:26:46,380
Now I understand.

3743
02:26:49,940 --> 02:26:50,860
There we go.

3744
02:26:51,020 --> 02:26:51,460
Oh shit!

3745
02:26:51,500 --> 02:26:52,120
Did you guys see that?

3746
02:26:52,200 --> 02:26:54,040
I got the...

3747
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:56,880
I got the fucking...

3748
02:26:58,300 --> 02:26:59,640
Sleep on that.

3749
02:26:59,740 --> 02:27:00,560
That shit was crazy.

3750
02:27:00,840 --> 02:27:01,600
Holy shit.

3751
02:27:02,540 --> 02:27:03,860
Oh my god.

3752
02:27:07,260 --> 02:27:08,600
Oh, I missed this leap.

3753
02:27:11,340 --> 02:27:12,880
It's okay, I got you guys!

3754
02:27:13,360 --> 02:27:13,420
It's okay, I got you guys!

3755
02:27:13,800 --> 02:27:14,640
I got...

3756
02:27:14,640 --> 02:27:16,660
Oh, god.

3757
02:27:17,100 --> 02:27:18,280
Oh, goodbye.

3758
02:27:18,660 --> 02:27:19,240
I'm sorry.

3759
02:27:19,520 --> 02:27:20,640
I'm so sorry.

3760
02:27:21,420 --> 02:27:22,680
I'm so sorry.

3761
02:27:22,760 --> 02:27:24,120
You guys were so...

3762
02:27:24,120 --> 02:27:25,620
You guys are so fucked.

3763
02:27:27,700 --> 02:27:29,740
There was nothing for me to do.

3764
02:27:29,960 --> 02:27:32,320
You guys were fucked out of the way.

3765
02:27:32,500 --> 02:27:32,620
You guys were fucked out of the way.

3766
02:27:33,860 --> 02:27:36,500
The best I can do is fucking flank from behind.

3767
02:27:36,820 --> 02:27:37,300
The best I can do is fucking flank from behind.

3768
02:27:37,300 --> 02:27:37,600
Wow!

3769
02:27:39,280 --> 02:27:39,760
Wow!

3770
02:27:49,400 --> 02:27:50,060
That's fine.

3771
02:27:50,200 --> 02:27:50,920
Do I have enough?

3772
02:27:51,100 --> 02:27:52,280
No, I don't.

3773
02:27:55,450 --> 02:27:56,150
That's fine.

3774
02:27:58,250 --> 02:27:58,930
That's fine.

3775
02:28:00,590 --> 02:28:01,810
Oh, she's so low.

3776
02:28:02,830 --> 02:28:03,310
Oh, she's so low.

3777
02:28:03,310 --> 02:28:03,470
Come on.

3778
02:28:03,810 --> 02:28:04,730
She's so low.

3779
02:28:04,850 --> 02:28:05,370
Punch her!

3780
02:28:05,630 --> 02:28:06,670
Wait, where did she go?

3781
02:28:07,590 --> 02:28:08,470
Oh, there she is.

3782
02:28:08,490 --> 02:28:11,130
Oh, I can do it!

3783
02:28:11,950 --> 02:28:12,670
Finally, Ricochet!

3784
02:28:14,030 --> 02:28:15,250
It's over, but like...

3785
02:28:15,870 --> 02:28:17,490
At least I can buy Ricochet.

3786
02:28:18,550 --> 02:28:19,370
Where do I buy...

3787
02:28:19,370 --> 02:28:20,270
Put Ricochet on?

3788
02:28:20,450 --> 02:28:20,710
Chat.

3789
02:28:22,570 --> 02:28:24,210
Guys, where do I put Ricochet on?

3790
02:28:28,500 --> 02:28:29,360
Where do I do it?

3791
02:28:29,440 --> 02:28:29,660
Oh, wait.

3792
02:28:29,660 --> 02:28:31,500
Where do I... Which one do I get rid of?

3793
02:28:31,640 --> 02:28:32,780
Which one do I get rid of?

3794
02:28:32,860 --> 02:28:33,120
Okay.

3795
02:28:34,220 --> 02:28:34,580
Okay.

3796
02:28:35,520 --> 02:28:36,360
Alright, here we go.

3797
02:28:36,420 --> 02:28:36,860
It's over.

3798
02:28:36,860 --> 02:28:38,500
We figured it out.

3799
02:28:39,640 --> 02:28:41,620
We figured out the game plan here.

3800
02:28:42,600 --> 02:28:43,220
This is it.

3801
02:28:43,240 --> 02:28:43,960
It's so over.

3802
02:28:44,040 --> 02:28:44,680
We have...

3803
02:28:44,680 --> 02:28:45,960
We have Ricochet.

3804
02:28:48,800 --> 02:28:50,120
Oh my god!

3805
02:28:50,140 --> 02:28:50,880
It's so over.

3806
02:28:51,220 --> 02:28:52,960
It's so over for you.

3807
02:28:53,400 --> 02:28:55,100
It's so over!

3808
02:28:58,960 --> 02:28:59,680
That's great.

3809
02:29:00,500 --> 02:29:02,280
It's so over for you.

3810
02:29:03,260 --> 02:29:05,100
It's literally so over.

3811
02:29:05,200 --> 02:29:06,460
I have the ultimate

3812
02:29:10,300 --> 02:29:12,480
Can't do anything about it.

3813
02:29:12,540 --> 02:29:13,660
That's fucking right.

3814
02:29:16,720 --> 02:29:17,760
You fucker.

3815
02:29:19,860 --> 02:29:20,820
You think I don't know?

3816
02:29:21,080 --> 02:29:22,540
You think I don't know, buddy?

3817
02:29:26,280 --> 02:29:27,860
You think I don't know?

3818
02:29:28,140 --> 02:29:29,300
Oh my god.

3819
02:29:29,320 --> 02:29:29,760
It's over.

3820
02:29:30,200 --> 02:29:32,140
It's so over for her.

3821
02:29:33,040 --> 02:29:34,980
It's actually so over.

3822
02:29:37,840 --> 02:29:38,520
Okay.

3823
02:29:38,660 --> 02:29:39,660
We just gotta keep farming.

3824
02:29:41,180 --> 02:29:42,360
Nerf incoming.

3825
02:29:43,880 --> 02:29:46,940
The moment I figured out about Ricochet.

3826
02:29:48,880 --> 02:29:49,940
We're in it.

3827
02:29:51,200 --> 02:29:52,680
We're so in it.

3828
02:29:54,520 --> 02:29:56,080
We're so in it.

3829
02:29:56,200 --> 02:29:57,460
It's not even funny.

3830
02:29:57,800 --> 02:29:59,400
Holy shit!

3831
02:30:01,840 --> 02:30:05,120
That DPS should not be legal.

3832
02:30:10,930 --> 02:30:11,810
Actually.

3833
02:30:11,810 --> 02:30:15,010
That is crazy DPS right there.

3834
02:30:15,290 --> 02:30:18,130
That DPS is insane.

3835
02:30:20,210 --> 02:30:23,030
That is actually insane.

3836
02:30:26,310 --> 02:30:28,370
Oh my god.

3837
02:30:28,470 --> 02:30:30,370
What the f...

3838
02:30:36,150 --> 02:30:37,230
Where is she?

3839
02:30:44,320 --> 02:30:45,440
I'm sorry.

3840
02:30:45,640 --> 02:30:47,040
I'm so sorry.

3841
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:48,380
What did she do?

3842
02:30:48,480 --> 02:30:49,160
What was that?

3843
02:30:50,060 --> 02:30:51,360
What the fuck?

3844
02:31:04,940 --> 02:31:06,380
What do I do for this?

3845
02:31:06,780 --> 02:31:08,940
I don't know what to put.

3846
02:31:09,520 --> 02:31:10,460
Improve reach.

3847
02:31:10,620 --> 02:31:11,560
Do I put it on?

3848
02:31:11,880 --> 02:31:13,800
Oh, I guess that's the only one.

3849
02:31:14,120 --> 02:31:15,740
Oh my god.

3850
02:31:17,460 --> 02:31:19,620
She swung her HP.

3851
02:31:21,040 --> 02:31:22,160
Guys, it's over.

3852
02:31:23,700 --> 02:31:25,540
I got Ricochet too late.

3853
02:31:25,820 --> 02:31:26,620
I can't...

3854
02:31:28,580 --> 02:31:30,680
I got baited so hard.

3855
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:32,360
Oh my god.

3856
02:31:32,720 --> 02:31:36,140
I got baited so fucking hard by that.

3857
02:31:36,260 --> 02:31:37,300
That's crazy.

3858
02:31:39,520 --> 02:31:40,560
I can't...

3859
02:31:40,560 --> 02:31:41,300
Guys, I'm sorry.

3860
02:31:41,420 --> 02:31:42,480
I can't help but melee.

3861
02:31:42,780 --> 02:31:46,540
It's... after playing Abrams, it's like...

3862
02:31:46,540 --> 02:31:48,600
It's just second nature, you know?

3863
02:31:49,520 --> 02:31:52,300
It's literally second nature for me.

3864
02:31:53,440 --> 02:31:54,580
Okay, here we go.

3865
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:56,600
It's literally everything I can do.

3866
02:31:56,620 --> 02:31:57,260
right now.

3867
02:31:57,320 --> 02:32:01,920
Oh my god.

3868
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:02,940
It's so...

3869
02:32:02,940 --> 02:32:05,080
My team is...

3870
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:09,160
My team is not doing so well right now.

3871
02:32:09,460 --> 02:32:13,620
I accidentally fell in.

3872
02:32:13,780 --> 02:32:15,040
I fell in accidentally.

3873
02:32:18,920 --> 02:32:20,060
Oh no.

3874
02:32:20,780 --> 02:32:21,580
My...

3875
02:32:22,520 --> 02:32:23,880
That was an accident.

3876
02:32:26,720 --> 02:32:27,300
No.

3877
02:32:27,440 --> 02:32:28,240
I got stunned.

3878
02:32:28,940 --> 02:32:29,740
That's fine.

3879
02:32:30,320 --> 02:32:31,160
That's fine.

3880
02:32:33,580 --> 02:32:34,600
That's so fine.

3881
02:32:35,140 --> 02:32:36,280
I got the farm.

3882
02:32:37,940 --> 02:32:38,780
That's okay.

3883
02:32:40,940 --> 02:32:41,520
That's okay.

3884
02:32:41,580 --> 02:32:42,160
Literally.

3885
02:32:42,420 --> 02:32:43,600
Just keep Ricochet.

3886
02:32:44,350 --> 02:32:45,320
Just keep Ricochet.

3887
02:32:48,880 --> 02:32:50,340
Just keep Ricochet.

3888
02:32:50,860 --> 02:32:50,900
Just keep Ricochet.

3889
02:32:50,900 --> 02:32:52,710
Just keep Ricochet.

3890
02:32:53,300 --> 02:32:53,560
Yes!

3891
02:32:53,800 --> 02:32:54,220
Okay.

3892
02:32:54,220 --> 02:32:55,220
Do I have enough?

3893
02:32:55,480 --> 02:32:57,080
Do I have enough for Leech, guys?

3894
02:32:57,260 --> 02:32:57,780
I don't know.

3895
02:32:59,060 --> 02:32:59,940
I don't know.

3896
02:33:03,460 --> 02:33:04,880
I'm just trying...

3897
02:33:04,880 --> 02:33:06,460
I'm just trying to make sure...

3898
02:33:07,760 --> 02:33:10,340
I'm just trying to make sure my team is okay.

3899
02:33:11,180 --> 02:33:12,280
That's really it.

3900
02:33:15,780 --> 02:33:19,360
We fend them off for another day.

3901
02:33:20,560 --> 02:33:23,280
We were able to fend them off another day.

3902
02:33:27,850 --> 02:33:28,850
Oh, shit.

3903
02:33:29,470 --> 02:33:30,770
Oh, shit.

3904
02:33:30,870 --> 02:33:31,890
Don't worry.

3905
02:33:32,010 --> 02:33:33,050
No, my team!

3906
02:33:33,170 --> 02:33:34,870
Team, are you guys okay?

3907
02:33:36,290 --> 02:33:38,050
Are you guys okay?

3908
02:33:38,630 --> 02:33:39,790
Be strong!

3909
02:33:43,730 --> 02:33:45,030
Be strong!

3910
02:33:48,610 --> 02:33:51,050
You guys got this!

3911
02:33:51,090 --> 02:33:52,610
Be strong, everybody!

3912
02:33:52,970 --> 02:33:53,730
Be strong, everybody!

3913
02:33:56,070 --> 02:33:56,810
We can do it!

3914
02:33:59,900 --> 02:34:01,580
Oh, you think I don't know?

3915
02:34:01,740 --> 02:34:02,800
You think I'm...

3916
02:34:03,420 --> 02:34:04,340
Good side.

3917
02:34:04,580 --> 02:34:06,940
You think I'm not used to this?

3918
02:34:07,260 --> 02:34:08,100
You think...

3919
02:34:09,160 --> 02:34:10,960
Oh, that's fucking right.

3920
02:34:11,920 --> 02:34:13,480
That's fucking right!

3921
02:34:14,140 --> 02:34:15,520
Oh, I can buy it!

3922
02:34:15,880 --> 02:34:17,040
I can buy Leech!

3923
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:20,160
Oh my god, it's time!

3924
02:34:22,980 --> 02:34:23,540
Alright.

3925
02:34:27,060 --> 02:34:27,420
Alright.

3926
02:34:28,080 --> 02:34:29,180
Alright, where's Leech?

3927
02:34:29,280 --> 02:34:30,040
Which one's Leech?

3928
02:34:30,440 --> 02:34:31,060
Where is it?

3929
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:33,060
Guys, where is Leech?

3930
02:34:35,200 --> 02:34:35,560
Guys!

3931
02:34:35,560 --> 02:34:36,220
Guys, please!

3932
02:34:36,480 --> 02:34:36,840
Oh, wait.

3933
02:34:37,500 --> 02:34:37,860
Leech.

3934
02:34:38,080 --> 02:34:38,940
Which one is it?

3935
02:34:40,340 --> 02:34:40,960
Oh, here you go!

3936
02:34:41,200 --> 02:34:42,680
There it is!

3937
02:34:43,600 --> 02:34:44,560
What do I get rid of?

3938
02:34:44,980 --> 02:34:46,320
Guys, which one do I get rid of?

3939
02:34:46,400 --> 02:34:50,380
Which one?

3940
02:34:50,380 --> 02:34:50,400
Which one?

3941
02:34:51,440 --> 02:34:51,960
Okay.

3942
02:34:53,620 --> 02:34:54,300
I'm sorry.

3943
02:34:54,500 --> 02:34:59,900
I know, like, people needed me and I was too busy trying to figure out how to how to buy stuff.

3944
02:35:02,440 --> 02:35:04,380
Because I know...

3945
02:35:06,940 --> 02:35:07,460
Okay.

3946
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:09,060
I'm so sorry.

3947
02:35:09,160 --> 02:35:10,560
I know you guys need my help.

3948
02:35:10,600 --> 02:35:12,160
I was so busy buying stuff.

3949
02:35:16,950 --> 02:35:18,630
Oh, he fucking ran.

3950
02:35:19,010 --> 02:35:20,530
Like a little bitch boy.

3951
02:35:21,210 --> 02:35:22,230
You think I don't know?

3952
02:35:22,990 --> 02:35:23,770
I don't know you're right here.

3953
02:35:27,260 --> 02:35:27,900
Oh, fuck.

3954
02:35:28,020 --> 02:35:29,000
Oh, shit.

3955
02:35:31,500 --> 02:35:32,200
Oh, fuck.

3956
02:35:32,360 --> 02:35:33,060
Oh, you think...

3957
02:35:33,060 --> 02:35:34,580
Oh, I'm not scared of you.

3958
02:35:34,620 --> 02:35:34,760
Wait.

3959
02:35:34,820 --> 02:35:35,880
I'm not scared of you.

3960
02:35:36,080 --> 02:35:36,960
Wait a minute.

3961
02:35:37,080 --> 02:35:38,460
I'm not scared of you at all.

3962
02:35:39,540 --> 02:35:40,400
Wait a minute.

3963
02:35:43,120 --> 02:35:44,660
I'm not scared of you at all.

3964
02:35:44,960 --> 02:35:46,080
You're so weak.

3965
02:35:49,780 --> 02:35:51,600
Why should I be scared of you?

3966
02:35:52,560 --> 02:35:53,360
Why should I be scared of you?

3967
02:35:54,020 --> 02:35:54,420
Okay.

3968
02:35:56,040 --> 02:35:56,480
Why did I steal?

3969
02:35:58,240 --> 02:35:59,200
Why did I steal?

3970
02:35:59,200 --> 02:35:59,440
Why did I need... oh!

3971
02:35:59,660 --> 02:36:00,100
Wait.

3972
02:36:00,200 --> 02:36:00,800
This is good.

3973
02:36:03,580 --> 02:36:04,460
A rejuvenator.

3974
02:36:06,220 --> 02:36:06,660
This?

3975
02:36:10,520 --> 02:36:11,520
Oh, I gotta help.

3976
02:36:11,600 --> 02:36:12,060
I gotta help.

3977
02:36:14,120 --> 02:36:14,980
Wait, they do?

3978
02:36:16,360 --> 02:36:17,040
Oh, no.

3979
02:36:17,840 --> 02:36:18,560
Oh, no.

3980
02:36:19,180 --> 02:36:19,960
Oh, no!

3981
02:36:20,640 --> 02:36:22,360
They got... I didn't even realize!

3982
02:36:22,360 --> 02:36:22,900
I didn't even realize!

3983
02:36:23,660 --> 02:36:26,800
I didn't even realize they were doing the rejuvenating shit!

3984
02:36:26,940 --> 02:36:27,500
Oh no!

3985
02:36:27,620 --> 02:36:28,160
No!

3986
02:36:29,080 --> 02:36:29,680
What?!

3987
02:36:31,140 --> 02:36:32,060
Oh god!

3988
02:36:32,400 --> 02:36:33,800
Oh I can't even!

3989
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:35,280
I can't even get out!

3990
02:36:38,350 --> 02:36:38,950
No.

3991
02:36:39,270 --> 02:36:40,170
Oh no.

3992
02:36:40,230 --> 02:36:40,910
I'm still alive.

3993
02:36:41,370 --> 02:36:42,530
I'm still alive.

3994
02:36:42,610 --> 02:36:44,110
I can't move but...

3995
02:36:44,110 --> 02:36:45,130
No!

3996
02:36:45,170 --> 02:36:45,550
No!

3997
02:36:47,050 --> 02:36:47,890
It's over.

3998
02:36:49,670 --> 02:36:50,590
It's over.

3999
02:36:53,090 --> 02:36:54,930
We had a good run.

4000
02:36:55,470 --> 02:36:57,290
We had a good run.

4001
02:36:57,650 --> 02:36:59,910
We had a good run.

4002
02:37:01,210 --> 02:37:03,530
Guys, I just got the lifesteal.

4003
02:37:03,570 --> 02:37:05,110
I don't know how to work with it.

4004
02:37:05,190 --> 02:37:07,350
I didn't know.

4005
02:37:09,130 --> 02:37:10,390
I didn't know.

4006
02:37:10,490 --> 02:37:12,770
This is my first time with a lifesteal.

4007
02:37:13,410 --> 02:37:14,990
Nice team death.

4008
02:37:18,290 --> 02:37:19,150
Guys, wait.

4009
02:37:19,310 --> 02:37:19,870
I think...

4010
02:37:19,870 --> 02:37:20,570
Guys, I can make it.

4011
02:37:20,590 --> 02:37:20,970
Guys, I can make it work.

4012
02:37:21,250 --> 02:37:22,390
Guys, I can...

4013
02:37:22,390 --> 02:37:24,150
I can make this work.

4014
02:37:24,290 --> 02:37:26,190
I can make Haze work, guys.

4015
02:37:26,450 --> 02:37:27,530
Guys, I can...

4016
02:37:27,530 --> 02:37:29,610
Now that I realize...

4017
02:37:29,610 --> 02:37:32,210
Now that I realize how to play Haze...

4018
02:37:32,210 --> 02:37:34,110
I can make it work, guys.

4019
02:37:34,250 --> 02:37:35,390
I swear to god.

4020
02:37:35,570 --> 02:37:36,550
Oh no, there's an Abram.

4021
02:37:36,650 --> 02:37:38,670
No, I have to fight an Abram?

4022
02:37:39,410 --> 02:37:39,890
No!

4023
02:37:44,050 --> 02:37:44,530
No!

4024
02:37:44,530 --> 02:37:46,590
I don't know how good Abram is!

4025
02:37:47,490 --> 02:37:47,970
I...

4026
02:37:50,950 --> 02:37:51,350
No!

4027
02:37:53,290 --> 02:37:54,630
I hate this game.

4028
02:37:54,930 --> 02:37:57,010
I hate this game.

4029
02:37:59,730 --> 02:38:00,870
Oh, there's two of us!

4030
02:38:00,970 --> 02:38:02,370
Oh my god, I have a friend!

4031
02:38:02,710 --> 02:38:03,210
Let's go!

4032
02:38:04,950 --> 02:38:06,210
Let's fucking go.

4033
02:38:06,290 --> 02:38:07,230
I have a friend.

4034
02:38:07,930 --> 02:38:08,950
Okay, but now...

4035
02:38:08,950 --> 02:38:09,990
Now I know how...

4036
02:38:09,990 --> 02:38:11,210
Now I just need to know...

4037
02:38:11,210 --> 02:38:12,550
Now I just know how to do the build.

4038
02:38:13,890 --> 02:38:14,610
It'll be fine.

4039
02:38:14,890 --> 02:38:16,230
We figured it out, guys.

4040
02:38:19,470 --> 02:38:20,490
We figured it out.

4041
02:38:23,410 --> 02:38:25,110
Like, we know how to play this...

4042
02:38:25,110 --> 02:38:26,690
We know how to play Haze now.

4043
02:38:27,110 --> 02:38:29,850
Oh my god, we know how to play Haze.

4044
02:38:30,030 --> 02:38:31,330
Because I'm not addicted.

4045
02:38:31,570 --> 02:38:32,010
I just...

4046
02:38:32,010 --> 02:38:34,530
I just know how to play Haze now.

4047
02:38:36,850 --> 02:38:37,330
Okay.

4048
02:38:39,530 --> 02:38:41,810
I need to make sure, like, I don't get distracted.

4049
02:38:43,830 --> 02:38:45,290
I just need to make sure...

4050
02:38:45,790 --> 02:38:47,010
Bro, what the fuck?

4051
02:38:47,470 --> 02:38:48,750
Get away from me!

4052
02:38:51,050 --> 02:38:52,270
Okay, that's fine.

4053
02:38:52,370 --> 02:38:52,830
I'm okay.

4054
02:38:53,170 --> 02:38:53,950
I'm okay.

4055
02:38:54,250 --> 02:38:55,250
Where's the shop?

4056
02:38:57,450 --> 02:39:00,530
The moment I get out of the stupid...

4057
02:39:00,530 --> 02:39:02,670
Oh, I don't have anything.

4058
02:39:02,930 --> 02:39:06,910
The moment I get out of the stupid lane part of the game...

4059
02:39:07,490 --> 02:39:09,430
Like, things actually work.

4060
02:39:11,150 --> 02:39:13,050
The only issue is that...

4061
02:39:13,050 --> 02:39:15,950
The lane part of this game is very long.

4062
02:39:16,150 --> 02:39:18,350
And I don't have the patience for it sometimes.

4063
02:39:20,490 --> 02:39:21,610
That's the worst part.

4064
02:39:23,530 --> 02:39:24,130
No.

4065
02:39:24,310 --> 02:39:25,750
No, not Abram.

4066
02:39:26,110 --> 02:39:27,530
Not Abram.

4067
02:39:27,570 --> 02:39:27,810
No!

4068
02:39:28,010 --> 02:39:28,690
Get away!

4069
02:39:32,270 --> 02:39:34,970
Why is my teammate not looking at him?

4070
02:39:39,050 --> 02:39:40,070
Teammate, please!

4071
02:39:41,010 --> 02:39:42,550
I almost died!

4072
02:39:46,610 --> 02:39:47,510
I'm leaving.

4073
02:39:47,710 --> 02:39:48,530
I need a heal.

4074
02:39:49,010 --> 02:39:50,090
I'm leaving.

4075
02:39:50,090 --> 02:39:50,570
I need a heal.

4076
02:39:51,790 --> 02:39:52,910
I need a heal.

4077
02:39:55,210 --> 02:39:55,910
I'm leaving.

4078
02:39:59,710 --> 02:40:00,270
I'm leaving.

4079
02:40:00,510 --> 02:40:00,910
I'm leaving.

4080
02:40:02,470 --> 02:40:03,030
I'm leaving.

4081
02:40:03,030 --> 02:40:03,110
I'm leaving.

4082
02:40:03,110 --> 02:40:03,430
I'm leaving.

4083
02:40:03,430 --> 02:40:03,590
I'm leaving.

4084
02:40:03,590 --> 02:40:04,310
I'm leaving.

4085
02:40:04,410 --> 02:40:04,490
I'm leaving.

4086
02:40:04,490 --> 02:40:04,750
I'm leaving.

4087
02:40:05,030 --> 02:40:05,590
I'm leaving.

4088
02:40:05,590 --> 02:40:06,030
I'm leaving.

4089
02:40:06,030 --> 02:40:10,950
Maybe having a friend fucking sucks.

4090
02:40:15,270 --> 02:40:16,370
It's not fun.

4091
02:40:21,930 --> 02:40:24,290
I'd rather be in the solo lane now.

4092
02:40:24,390 --> 02:40:25,690
My teammate is not...

4093
02:40:25,690 --> 02:40:28,630
My teammate is not fucking helpful.

4094
02:40:31,210 --> 02:40:32,130
I've decided.

4095
02:40:32,990 --> 02:40:35,010
I should have been in the solo lane all along.

4096
02:40:37,650 --> 02:40:39,230
I realized my mistakes.

4097
02:40:40,790 --> 02:40:45,350
I realized my mistakes thinking that I would enjoy having a friend.

4098
02:40:49,790 --> 02:40:50,630
They were wrong.

4099
02:40:50,890 --> 02:40:52,090
Okay, I gotta sleep.

4100
02:40:55,150 --> 02:40:55,910
Come on!

4101
02:40:56,090 --> 02:40:57,130
Peek your head!

4102
02:41:03,870 --> 02:41:05,810
I'm gonna steal your creep too.

4103
02:41:07,730 --> 02:41:09,910
I'm gonna steal your fucking creep.

4104
02:41:11,350 --> 02:41:12,050
That's right.

4105
02:41:15,670 --> 02:41:16,730
That's fucking right.

4106
02:41:17,270 --> 02:41:19,030
Pushing out the A.

4107
02:41:19,970 --> 02:41:21,750
The cow, they're juggling.

4108
02:41:25,230 --> 02:41:25,670
Nice.

4109
02:41:28,050 --> 02:41:28,490
Reload.

4110
02:41:28,630 --> 02:41:29,390
Oh hey, he's back.

4111
02:41:29,470 --> 02:41:30,050
Wait, he's back.

4112
02:41:30,270 --> 02:41:31,330
Wait a minute, he's back.

4113
02:41:34,210 --> 02:41:35,210
Wait a minute.

4114
02:41:35,790 --> 02:41:37,230
Oh, he's back too!

4115
02:41:37,490 --> 02:41:38,630
Oh no, b-bop!

4116
02:41:39,350 --> 02:41:40,470
Not b-bop.

4117
02:41:40,850 --> 02:41:42,110
Not b-bop.

4118
02:41:42,150 --> 02:41:43,350
Wait, they swapped lanes.

4119
02:41:45,350 --> 02:41:46,550
They literally swapped.

4120
02:41:46,930 --> 02:41:47,530
That's illegal.

4121
02:41:48,710 --> 02:41:51,130
When you have your friend, you gotta be friends forever.

4122
02:41:51,490 --> 02:41:52,310
That's not true.

4123
02:41:52,550 --> 02:41:53,450
People change.

4124
02:41:54,710 --> 02:41:56,930
But it's still... that's so... that's so dumb.

4125
02:41:57,510 --> 02:41:58,950
I can't believe it.

4126
02:42:00,330 --> 02:42:01,430
I'm gonna buy stuff.

4127
02:42:02,210 --> 02:42:03,010
That's illegal!

4128
02:42:03,010 --> 02:42:05,610
They literally swapped lanes!

4129
02:42:07,850 --> 02:42:08,710
Oh shit.

4130
02:42:12,410 --> 02:42:13,510
Oh no, oh no.

4131
02:42:13,930 --> 02:42:14,950
I'm trying to help you.

4132
02:42:16,850 --> 02:42:18,090
I'm trying to help you!

4133
02:42:19,870 --> 02:42:20,870
He ran off!

4134
02:42:21,030 --> 02:42:22,230
Like a little bitch!

4135
02:42:26,140 --> 02:42:27,260
Oh shit!

4136
02:42:28,100 --> 02:42:29,400
Oh shit, okay.

4137
02:42:30,280 --> 02:42:32,120
Almost got too early there.

4138
02:42:33,360 --> 02:42:34,300
That was close.

4139
02:42:34,720 --> 02:42:35,860
That was actually close.

4140
02:42:38,620 --> 02:42:39,200
That's fine.

4141
02:42:40,400 --> 02:42:41,300
That's fine.

4142
02:42:42,680 --> 02:42:43,760
Oh shit.

4143
02:42:44,660 --> 02:42:45,420
Oh shit!

4144
02:42:45,480 --> 02:42:46,440
Oh shit!

4145
02:42:47,360 --> 02:42:48,040
Boom!

4146
02:42:48,060 --> 02:42:48,720
No!

4147
02:42:48,720 --> 02:42:49,520
I'm sorry!

4148
02:42:50,480 --> 02:42:51,160
Why?

4149
02:42:52,720 --> 02:42:54,540
Why does she keep doing...

4150
02:42:54,540 --> 02:42:56,600
Why does she keep leaving me?

4151
02:42:58,680 --> 02:42:59,340
Okay, it's fine.

4152
02:42:59,660 --> 02:43:02,640
Oh, I should've gotten life steer.

4153
02:43:02,960 --> 02:43:04,060
No, it's fine.

4154
02:43:04,120 --> 02:43:04,560
It's fine.

4155
02:43:04,560 --> 02:43:04,720
It's fine.

4156
02:43:05,260 --> 02:43:06,720
I don't do anything in order.

4157
02:43:07,040 --> 02:43:07,400
Anyway.

4158
02:43:10,740 --> 02:43:11,320
It's okay.

4159
02:43:11,720 --> 02:43:12,980
Wait, where were we?

4160
02:43:13,020 --> 02:43:13,960
We were in blue, right?

4161
02:43:17,020 --> 02:43:18,440
Guys, I lost track of my color.

4162
02:43:18,720 --> 02:43:19,540
Was I in blue?

4163
02:43:21,340 --> 02:43:21,940
Wrong lane?

4164
02:43:22,080 --> 02:43:22,480
Yeah, okay.

4165
02:43:22,540 --> 02:43:23,140
I was in blue.

4166
02:43:23,240 --> 02:43:23,460
Okay.

4167
02:43:25,840 --> 02:43:27,140
Guys, it wasn't the wrong lane.

4168
02:43:27,280 --> 02:43:29,460
I did this on purpose so I can grab some stuff here.

4169
02:43:30,240 --> 02:43:30,840
Look at that.

4170
02:43:31,540 --> 02:43:32,620
Now I have extra stuff.

4171
02:43:33,180 --> 02:43:34,300
How do I get out of here?

4172
02:43:34,380 --> 02:43:34,540
Okay.

4173
02:43:34,540 --> 02:43:35,560
Oh, no.

4174
02:43:35,640 --> 02:43:36,140
Don't worry.

4175
02:43:36,200 --> 02:43:36,960
Don't worry, friend.

4176
02:43:39,480 --> 02:43:40,100
Don't worry.

4177
02:43:40,600 --> 02:43:41,540
I got you.

4178
02:43:43,480 --> 02:43:45,060
I never leave you.

4179
02:43:45,580 --> 02:43:46,360
Don't worry.

4180
02:43:48,380 --> 02:43:49,620
I never leave you.

4181
02:43:51,200 --> 02:43:51,680
See?

4182
02:43:51,940 --> 02:43:52,740
We did it.

4183
02:43:53,820 --> 02:43:54,620
We helped.

4184
02:43:55,640 --> 02:43:56,120
Teamwork.

4185
02:44:02,310 --> 02:44:03,630
Are you serious?

4186
02:44:03,870 --> 02:44:04,470
I got...

4187
02:44:05,470 --> 02:44:05,950
Please.

4188
02:44:06,350 --> 02:44:07,390
Please, look at me!

4189
02:44:07,790 --> 02:44:08,490
Oh, no!

4190
02:44:08,550 --> 02:44:08,670
Oh, no!

4191
02:44:08,670 --> 02:44:09,370
Look!

4192
02:44:11,650 --> 02:44:13,450
Next time.

4193
02:44:14,270 --> 02:44:15,790
Holy shit.

4194
02:44:15,870 --> 02:44:25,850
I feel like I got baited like three times, but I swear to God, I feel like I got baited so many times.

4195
02:44:29,990 --> 02:44:32,590
Are you serious?

4196
02:44:32,930 --> 02:44:34,610
Holy shit.

4197
02:44:34,830 --> 02:44:35,510
Okay.

4198
02:44:35,610 --> 02:44:37,490
I baited myself.

4199
02:44:37,750 --> 02:44:38,650
Oh, no.

4200
02:44:38,670 --> 02:44:38,930
Maybe.

4201
02:44:39,030 --> 02:44:39,310
True.

4202
02:44:39,530 --> 02:44:40,470
Maybe I did.

4203
02:44:41,770 --> 02:44:42,210
Wait.

4204
02:44:42,270 --> 02:44:42,570
Am I...

4205
02:44:42,570 --> 02:44:43,290
Is my friend dead?

4206
02:44:43,930 --> 02:44:44,830
Oh, she's dead.

4207
02:44:45,130 --> 02:44:45,950
No, she's not.

4208
02:44:46,010 --> 02:44:46,250
Okay.

4209
02:44:49,270 --> 02:44:49,930
Snap time.

4210
02:44:50,270 --> 02:44:51,910
Oh, it's not the wrong person.

4211
02:44:52,710 --> 02:44:53,150
True.

4212
02:44:53,210 --> 02:44:54,190
Maybe I was...

4213
02:44:54,190 --> 02:44:55,130
I think I was the problem.

4214
02:44:55,310 --> 02:44:58,050
Actually, I would not be surprised if I was.

4215
02:45:00,710 --> 02:45:01,150
No.

4216
02:45:01,330 --> 02:45:01,550
No.

4217
02:45:01,590 --> 02:45:01,950
You're right.

4218
02:45:02,050 --> 02:45:02,810
I'm the problem.

4219
02:45:03,290 --> 02:45:03,730
No.

4220
02:45:03,790 --> 02:45:05,250
You're 100% right.

4221
02:45:05,510 --> 02:45:06,090
You're right.

4222
02:45:07,290 --> 02:45:09,630
I'm like the cocky DPS player.

4223
02:45:11,030 --> 02:45:15,410
I am 100% that cocky DPS player right there.

4224
02:45:19,470 --> 02:45:20,490
He's so low.

4225
02:45:20,890 --> 02:45:22,770
He's actually so low.

4226
02:45:22,970 --> 02:45:23,290
Fuck.

4227
02:45:25,530 --> 02:45:25,870
No.

4228
02:45:28,490 --> 02:45:29,810
I'm so mad.

4229
02:45:30,910 --> 02:45:32,290
He was so low.

4230
02:45:32,650 --> 02:45:33,290
Okay.

4231
02:45:35,530 --> 02:45:36,410
That's fine.

4232
02:45:36,890 --> 02:45:37,730
It was fine.

4233
02:45:37,750 --> 02:45:38,310
He was so close.

4234
02:45:39,350 --> 02:45:39,930
What?

4235
02:45:40,390 --> 02:45:41,130
Cancel it.

4236
02:45:41,270 --> 02:45:41,770
Oh, there it is.

4237
02:45:42,890 --> 02:45:44,570
We were actually so close.

4238
02:45:48,600 --> 02:45:49,800
Oh my god.

4239
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:50,840
It's not fair.

4240
02:45:51,960 --> 02:45:53,240
It's so not fair.

4241
02:45:57,080 --> 02:45:58,540
That was so not fair.

4242
02:45:58,740 --> 02:45:59,920
We deserved that.

4243
02:46:02,320 --> 02:46:02,900
Bitch.

4244
02:46:04,620 --> 02:46:06,020
You actual bitch.

4245
02:46:08,080 --> 02:46:08,660
No.

4246
02:46:08,740 --> 02:46:09,580
He did the thing.

4247
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:10,840
He knows.

4248
02:46:10,860 --> 02:46:11,140
He knows.

4249
02:46:11,160 --> 02:46:12,280
He fucking knows.

4250
02:46:12,540 --> 02:46:12,920
Oh.

4251
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:13,300
Nice.

4252
02:46:13,440 --> 02:46:13,600
Okay.

4253
02:46:15,180 --> 02:46:15,780
No.

4254
02:46:15,860 --> 02:46:16,300
Come on.

4255
02:46:16,460 --> 02:46:17,020
I need to reload.

4256
02:46:17,600 --> 02:46:18,200
Nice.

4257
02:46:18,920 --> 02:46:20,000
We did it.

4258
02:46:20,060 --> 02:46:20,500
Together.

4259
02:46:22,460 --> 02:46:23,740
We did it.

4260
02:46:23,860 --> 02:46:24,380
Oh.

4261
02:46:24,440 --> 02:46:25,080
I should have ulted.

4262
02:46:25,140 --> 02:46:26,440
I keep forgetting I have ult.

4263
02:46:27,120 --> 02:46:29,420
I keep forgetting I have ult.

4264
02:46:30,780 --> 02:46:31,480
It's okay.

4265
02:46:32,100 --> 02:46:33,620
It's a learning experience.

4266
02:46:34,560 --> 02:46:36,680
I keep forgetting my abilities.

4267
02:46:37,660 --> 02:46:38,560
It's okay.

4268
02:46:38,800 --> 02:46:40,780
It's all a learning experience.

4269
02:46:40,800 --> 02:46:41,140
Guys.

4270
02:46:43,540 --> 02:46:44,180
Okay.

4271
02:46:44,300 --> 02:46:45,680
Do I need to buy stuff?

4272
02:46:45,980 --> 02:46:46,140
Yeah.

4273
02:46:47,040 --> 02:46:47,680
Goodbye.

4274
02:46:48,040 --> 02:46:49,840
Goodbye my fellow teammate.

4275
02:46:51,320 --> 02:46:51,960
Goodbye.

4276
02:46:53,680 --> 02:46:54,320
Uh.

4277
02:46:55,400 --> 02:46:56,040
Sure.

4278
02:46:57,980 --> 02:46:58,640
Let's go.

4279
02:47:00,300 --> 02:47:00,940
Rush.

4280
02:47:00,940 --> 02:47:01,340
Ricochet.

4281
02:47:01,420 --> 02:47:01,680
Rush.

4282
02:47:01,820 --> 02:47:02,120
Ricochet.

4283
02:47:02,240 --> 02:47:03,520
I forgot.

4284
02:47:06,160 --> 02:47:07,100
I forgot.

4285
02:47:07,240 --> 02:47:07,520
Boom.

4286
02:47:07,580 --> 02:47:08,020
Ricochet.

4287
02:47:08,060 --> 02:47:08,500
Guys.

4288
02:47:08,700 --> 02:47:09,340
Guys.

4289
02:47:09,500 --> 02:47:10,140
Guys.

4290
02:47:10,140 --> 02:47:10,260
Guys.

4291
02:47:11,880 --> 02:47:12,520
Guys.

4292
02:47:12,520 --> 02:47:12,600
Guys.

4293
02:47:12,600 --> 02:47:14,180
I forgot all about.

4294
02:47:21,690 --> 02:47:22,430
Oh.

4295
02:47:22,550 --> 02:47:22,710
No.

4296
02:47:24,030 --> 02:47:25,510
Oh my God.

4297
02:47:28,150 --> 02:47:31,410
I can't believe I forgot about Ricochet.

4298
02:47:35,650 --> 02:47:38,250
The most important thing.

4299
02:47:40,990 --> 02:47:41,730
Okay.

4300
02:47:43,490 --> 02:47:44,430
That's fine.

4301
02:47:44,810 --> 02:47:45,750
I mean.

4302
02:47:46,230 --> 02:47:47,170
It's fine.

4303
02:47:52,830 --> 02:47:54,290
Give me this.

4304
02:47:54,850 --> 02:47:55,950
Give me this.

4305
02:47:57,830 --> 02:47:58,890
Give me this!

4306
02:47:59,770 --> 02:48:02,810
I need my ricochet!

4307
02:48:04,210 --> 02:48:05,310
Oh, we have a DC.

4308
02:48:05,490 --> 02:48:05,830
No!

4309
02:48:08,070 --> 02:48:09,250
Not the DC!

4310
02:48:12,590 --> 02:48:13,170
Okay.

4311
02:48:14,270 --> 02:48:14,850
Alright.

4312
02:48:15,330 --> 02:48:16,170
It's fine.

4313
02:48:16,350 --> 02:48:16,850
It's fine.

4314
02:48:18,250 --> 02:48:19,810
We can turn it around!

4315
02:48:23,070 --> 02:48:25,270
We can totally turn it around!

4316
02:48:26,010 --> 02:48:28,770
My buddy and I are still in it together!

4317
02:48:29,590 --> 02:48:31,010
Me and my buddy!

4318
02:48:32,810 --> 02:48:35,110
What do I need for ricochet anyway?

4319
02:48:35,350 --> 02:48:36,050
Upgrade my abilities?

4320
02:48:36,230 --> 02:48:36,410
Whoops.

4321
02:48:38,070 --> 02:48:38,630
Whoa.

4322
02:48:39,110 --> 02:48:41,550
I was not paying attention when that happened.

4323
02:48:43,490 --> 02:48:43,970
Okay.

4324
02:48:46,270 --> 02:48:47,270
6,000.

4325
02:48:47,930 --> 02:48:48,610
That's fine.

4326
02:48:48,850 --> 02:48:49,870
We're almost there.

4327
02:48:51,130 --> 02:48:52,170
We're so close.

4328
02:48:56,420 --> 02:48:58,220
We're so close to 6,000.

4329
02:48:58,220 --> 02:48:58,380
Wait.

4330
02:48:58,440 --> 02:48:58,920
Where's my buddy?

4331
02:49:01,940 --> 02:49:02,420
Wait.

4332
02:49:02,460 --> 02:49:03,060
Where's my friend?

4333
02:49:04,580 --> 02:49:05,440
Where is she?

4334
02:49:06,820 --> 02:49:07,300
No!

4335
02:49:08,140 --> 02:49:09,040
Where's my friend?

4336
02:49:12,660 --> 02:49:13,600
Where is she?

4337
02:49:16,480 --> 02:49:18,860
I don't know how to play this without her!

4338
02:49:19,740 --> 02:49:21,100
People change.

4339
02:49:21,600 --> 02:49:22,160
No!

4340
02:49:24,160 --> 02:49:25,340
People change!

4341
02:49:26,860 --> 02:49:30,100
I thought we were going to be in this together forever!

4342
02:49:32,100 --> 02:49:35,000
I can't believe he would leave me like that.

4343
02:49:35,860 --> 02:49:37,060
I'm so sad.

4344
02:49:37,400 --> 02:49:41,560
I thought we would be doing this for the rest of our lives.

4345
02:49:41,980 --> 02:49:42,540
I...

4346
02:49:44,200 --> 02:49:53,820
I thought we would be doing this for the rest of our existence here!

4347
02:49:56,380 --> 02:49:58,500
I thought we meant something!

4348
02:49:59,660 --> 02:50:01,000
Did we not?

4349
02:50:02,500 --> 02:50:05,840
Life is not so dorky anymore.

4350
02:50:06,640 --> 02:50:07,500
No!

4351
02:50:07,500 --> 02:50:07,800
No!

4352
02:50:10,940 --> 02:50:11,500
No!

4353
02:50:13,620 --> 02:50:15,140
Oh, I fucking missed it.

4354
02:50:15,280 --> 02:50:15,900
I missed.

4355
02:50:17,160 --> 02:50:17,900
It's okay.

4356
02:50:17,980 --> 02:50:18,920
I got this though.

4357
02:50:22,420 --> 02:50:23,300
That's fine.

4358
02:50:23,940 --> 02:50:25,080
We're almost at Ricochet!

4359
02:50:25,220 --> 02:50:26,020
We almost have it!

4360
02:50:28,140 --> 02:50:28,700
Okay.

4361
02:50:29,200 --> 02:50:29,760
Nice.

4362
02:50:30,820 --> 02:50:31,100
Wait.

4363
02:50:31,140 --> 02:50:32,400
What happened to the big guy?

4364
02:50:33,100 --> 02:50:33,660
Anyway.

4365
02:50:35,880 --> 02:50:36,640
Upgrade skill.

4366
02:50:36,640 --> 02:50:38,660
I won't stop until they're dead.

4367
02:50:39,060 --> 02:50:39,080
Okay.

4368
02:50:39,360 --> 02:50:40,500
Wait, did they do it?

4369
02:50:41,140 --> 02:50:42,100
Oh, they did.

4370
02:50:42,260 --> 02:50:42,720
Nice.

4371
02:50:43,160 --> 02:50:45,600
You only have one shrine left.

4372
02:50:45,860 --> 02:50:46,400
Wait.

4373
02:50:46,520 --> 02:50:46,860
Whoa!

4374
02:50:49,650 --> 02:50:51,250
That's where they all are!

4375
02:50:51,690 --> 02:50:51,750
Oh

4376
02:50:54,850 --> 02:50:55,310
my god!

4377
02:50:55,730 --> 02:50:59,250
I was like, you only have one shrine left!

4378
02:50:59,750 --> 02:51:02,370
I was like, excuse me?

4379
02:51:02,890 --> 02:51:03,330
Like...

4380
02:51:03,330 --> 02:51:04,490
And they're...

4381
02:51:06,170 --> 02:51:09,170
Wait, what the fuck happened?

4382
02:51:12,190 --> 02:51:14,850
Like, what the fuck?

4383
02:51:15,410 --> 02:51:16,310
Like, what the fuck?

4384
02:51:16,910 --> 02:51:19,970
Actually, what the fuck happened?

4385
02:51:21,950 --> 02:51:23,870
Like, what the...

4386
02:51:25,050 --> 02:51:26,650
Holy shit!

4387
02:51:27,230 --> 02:51:29,250
Okay, everything is fine now.

4388
02:51:29,330 --> 02:51:31,690
Everything is fine now.

4389
02:51:31,950 --> 02:51:32,750
Okay.

4390
02:51:32,950 --> 02:51:33,610
All right.

4391
02:51:33,630 --> 02:51:34,130
Ricochet.

4392
02:51:34,250 --> 02:51:34,950
There we go.

4393
02:51:35,110 --> 02:51:35,910
How much is leech?

4394
02:51:37,010 --> 02:51:37,410
Leech.

4395
02:51:37,410 --> 02:51:38,470
Okay.

4396
02:51:38,530 --> 02:51:39,690
6,000 too.

4397
02:51:39,790 --> 02:51:39,950
Okay.

4398
02:51:40,090 --> 02:51:41,030
This is fine.

4399
02:51:42,430 --> 02:51:43,050
Okay.

4400
02:51:44,030 --> 02:51:44,650
Now...

4401
02:51:44,650 --> 02:51:46,010
Now it's fine.

4402
02:51:47,770 --> 02:51:48,770
Same price.

4403
02:51:48,910 --> 02:51:49,170
Okay.

4404
02:51:49,670 --> 02:51:50,710
This is okay.

4405
02:51:51,070 --> 02:51:52,910
We figured it out.

4406
02:51:55,310 --> 02:51:56,490
Holy shit.

4407
02:51:56,530 --> 02:51:57,150
I was like wondering.

4408
02:51:57,270 --> 02:51:57,870
I was like, what?

4409
02:51:58,210 --> 02:52:01,010
What do you mean one shrine left?

4410
02:52:01,110 --> 02:52:02,090
Like, how?

4411
02:52:02,510 --> 02:52:04,470
How do we have one left?

4412
02:52:06,610 --> 02:52:07,050
No.

4413
02:52:07,050 --> 02:52:07,490
No.

4414
02:52:07,590 --> 02:52:08,250
Turin lady.

4415
02:52:08,830 --> 02:52:09,270
No!

4416
02:52:22,260 --> 02:52:22,700
No.

4417
02:52:23,780 --> 02:52:25,040
No, I might be dead though.

4418
02:52:25,780 --> 02:52:26,220
Whoa!

4419
02:52:31,260 --> 02:52:32,100
That's fucking right.

4420
02:52:32,660 --> 02:52:33,100
Whoa!

4421
02:52:34,740 --> 02:52:35,780
That's fucking right.

4422
02:52:35,980 --> 02:52:37,200
It's nap time, bitch.

4423
02:52:41,080 --> 02:52:42,000
Okay, we're okay.

4424
02:52:44,040 --> 02:52:45,660
We got nap time out of the way.

4425
02:52:48,060 --> 02:52:54,180
Oh, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm always paranoid vaulting ever since I, ever since I threw it.

4426
02:52:55,760 --> 02:52:57,120
What the fuck?

4427
02:52:57,260 --> 02:53:02,080
No, no, no, no, nope.

4428
02:53:02,940 --> 02:53:03,540
Nope.

4429
02:53:03,740 --> 02:53:04,600
Where am I?

4430
02:53:04,780 --> 02:53:05,960
That's fucking right.

4431
02:53:05,960 --> 02:53:06,620
Where am I?

4432
02:53:06,800 --> 02:53:07,820
Where am I?

4433
02:53:09,480 --> 02:53:10,080
Where am I?

4434
02:53:11,220 --> 02:53:13,160
Where am I?

4435
02:53:13,340 --> 02:53:13,920
Where am I?

4436
02:53:13,920 --> 02:53:14,460
Where am I?

4437
02:53:15,320 --> 02:53:15,620
Where am I?

4438
02:53:16,640 --> 02:53:19,220
Get your baited ass out of here!

4439
02:53:20,520 --> 02:53:21,960
That's fucking right.

4440
02:53:23,200 --> 02:53:24,920
Get baited, bitch.

4441
02:53:25,520 --> 02:53:27,420
Get fucking baited.

4442
02:53:27,860 --> 02:53:29,180
I need this farm.

4443
02:53:29,360 --> 02:53:30,720
I need this farm so bad.

4444
02:53:33,380 --> 02:53:34,120
Alright, nice.

4445
02:53:34,520 --> 02:53:36,060
We're almost at 6.2.

4446
02:53:36,120 --> 02:53:36,920
Oh, played.

4447
02:53:39,460 --> 02:53:41,400
See, this is the fun part.

4448
02:53:41,620 --> 02:53:45,120
The fun part of Deadlock when I'm not in the stupid lane.

4449
02:53:46,120 --> 02:53:46,640
Whatever.

4450
02:53:47,520 --> 02:53:50,820
This is literally the only time I can have fun in this game.

4451
02:53:52,820 --> 02:53:53,340
Play.

4452
02:53:54,080 --> 02:53:54,600
Nice.

4453
02:53:56,060 --> 02:53:56,580
Okay.

4454
02:53:57,320 --> 02:53:58,420
Where are they fighting?

4455
02:54:00,580 --> 02:54:02,360
I'm trying to, like, figure out where to go.

4456
02:54:03,280 --> 02:54:04,320
I'm trying...

4457
02:54:04,320 --> 02:54:06,780
I'll just get rid of all of these for now.

4458
02:54:09,340 --> 02:54:09,860
Punch.

4459
02:54:10,280 --> 02:54:10,800
Alright.

4460
02:54:12,200 --> 02:54:13,120
I'm so close!

4461
02:54:16,680 --> 02:54:17,360
Please!

4462
02:54:17,360 --> 02:54:19,220
I literally am so close!

4463
02:54:22,720 --> 02:54:23,800
Oh, we got help.

4464
02:54:25,200 --> 02:54:28,260
Getting lost is the true enemy.

4465
02:54:29,680 --> 02:54:31,000
Honestly, yeah.

4466
02:54:31,200 --> 02:54:35,840
I'm literally just getting lost in this entire game.

4467
02:54:36,860 --> 02:54:40,140
Oh, is he gonna push?

4468
02:54:40,700 --> 02:54:41,540
He's not?

4469
02:54:41,820 --> 02:54:42,760
Oh, interesting.

4470
02:54:47,750 --> 02:54:48,250
Oh.

4471
02:54:50,450 --> 02:54:51,170
That's fine.

4472
02:54:52,850 --> 02:54:54,350
That's fine, get baited.

4473
02:54:54,930 --> 02:54:56,050
I'm okay with that.

4474
02:54:57,050 --> 02:54:57,550
Nice.

4475
02:54:58,350 --> 02:55:00,070
How do you get lost with a ma- oh.

4476
02:55:01,190 --> 02:55:01,690
Yeah.

4477
02:55:02,610 --> 02:55:04,210
That's a very good question.

4478
02:55:04,450 --> 02:55:10,410
That's a very good question, guys.

4479
02:55:12,250 --> 02:55:14,670
You just get lost.

4480
02:55:15,470 --> 02:55:19,710
You see, when I play any game, it just happens.

4481
02:55:21,190 --> 02:55:23,190
Okay, now I will never run away.

4482
02:55:23,530 --> 02:55:25,470
I ain't afraid no more.

4483
02:55:26,970 --> 02:55:28,310
That's fucking right.

4484
02:55:30,170 --> 02:55:32,090
I'm not afraid anymore!

4485
02:55:34,150 --> 02:55:35,150
What the fuck?

4486
02:55:36,330 --> 02:55:37,330
What did she do?

4487
02:55:39,610 --> 02:55:40,970
Think I'm scared of you?

4488
02:55:42,890 --> 02:55:43,470
Yes!

4489
02:55:43,490 --> 02:55:43,750
Okay.

4490
02:55:47,010 --> 02:55:48,050
Wait, where did he go?

4491
02:55:50,970 --> 02:55:52,010
Where did he go?

4492
02:55:53,590 --> 02:55:55,530
I'm so- Oh, we're chasing.

4493
02:55:55,790 --> 02:55:56,250
Okay.

4494
02:55:57,010 --> 02:55:57,510
Alright.

4495
02:55:57,750 --> 02:55:59,250
But like, what if that's an item?

4496
02:55:59,490 --> 02:56:01,610
Wait, there's- There's somebody here.

4497
02:56:02,710 --> 02:56:03,210
Abram.

4498
02:56:05,050 --> 02:56:05,550
Abram.

4499
02:56:06,370 --> 02:56:06,870
Abram.

4500
02:56:06,870 --> 02:56:06,990
Abram.

4501
02:56:07,710 --> 02:56:08,210
Abram.

4502
02:56:08,470 --> 02:56:08,970
Abram.

4503
02:56:09,670 --> 02:56:10,170
Abram.

4504
02:56:10,630 --> 02:56:11,130
Abram.

4505
02:56:12,030 --> 02:56:12,530
Abram.

4506
02:56:12,650 --> 02:56:13,150
Abram.

4507
02:56:14,450 --> 02:56:14,950
Abram.

4508
02:56:16,950 --> 02:56:19,450
I know you don't have it no more!

4509
02:56:21,190 --> 02:56:22,050
That's right.

4510
02:56:23,530 --> 02:56:24,090
Worth.

4511
02:56:26,050 --> 02:56:26,610
100%.

4512
02:56:27,550 --> 02:56:30,810
I know he didn't have it anymore, so I went for it.

4513
02:56:31,290 --> 02:56:33,010
I went full YOLO on that.

4514
02:56:34,770 --> 02:56:36,790
That gamble was so worth it.

4515
02:56:37,270 --> 02:56:40,010
That was such a worth gamble.

4516
02:56:43,010 --> 02:56:43,770
That's fine.

4517
02:56:45,230 --> 02:56:45,830
That's fine.

4518
02:56:45,830 --> 02:56:46,390
Whoa, wait.

4519
02:56:46,510 --> 02:56:47,510
Wait, there's people here.

4520
02:56:48,990 --> 02:56:49,690
That's right.

4521
02:56:49,750 --> 02:56:50,930
Let me life steal.

4522
02:56:51,590 --> 02:56:52,810
That's fucking right.

4523
02:56:53,510 --> 02:56:54,330
Go to sleep.

4524
02:56:55,290 --> 02:56:56,570
Go to sleep!

4525
02:56:57,290 --> 02:56:58,470
I'm unstoppable!

4526
02:57:00,910 --> 02:57:02,150
Oh fuck, wait.

4527
02:57:02,230 --> 02:57:03,030
What the fuck?

4528
02:57:03,130 --> 02:57:03,450
Okay.

4529
02:57:03,630 --> 02:57:04,990
Please unlock the door.

4530
02:57:05,130 --> 02:57:05,730
Unlock!

4531
02:57:07,350 --> 02:57:08,190
Unlock now!

4532
02:57:10,510 --> 02:57:11,310
That's fine.

4533
02:57:11,450 --> 02:57:12,450
Everything is fine.

4534
02:57:13,370 --> 02:57:17,150
Everything is- Everything is fine.

4535
02:57:17,870 --> 02:57:19,450
Everything is so fine.

4536
02:57:19,830 --> 02:57:21,310
Everything is so healthy.

4537
02:57:22,210 --> 02:57:23,610
It's not like I have leech.

4538
02:57:24,290 --> 02:57:25,290
I'm healthy.

4539
02:57:26,250 --> 02:57:27,450
Oh shit!

4540
02:57:29,310 --> 02:57:31,070
Wait, I see an Abram.

4541
02:57:31,370 --> 02:57:32,950
I see an Abram!

4542
02:57:33,990 --> 02:57:36,510
Hey there, Abram!

4543
02:57:37,390 --> 02:57:37,990
Heeey!

4544
02:57:39,750 --> 02:57:41,110
Oh shit, okay.

4545
02:57:41,230 --> 02:57:41,850
Oh shit.

4546
02:57:41,850 --> 02:57:42,650
Oh shit.

4547
02:57:42,670 --> 02:57:43,370
OH SHIT!!

4548
02:57:43,370 --> 02:58:04,450
Oh my god.

4549
02:58:04,670 --> 02:58:05,870
He brought a friend.

4550
02:58:06,450 --> 02:58:11,650
I wouldn't have been scared if he didn't bring Bring his fucking friend, chat!

4551
02:58:13,990 --> 02:58:19,030
Look guys, if he didn't bring his friend, it would have been fine.

4552
02:58:22,230 --> 02:58:24,390
I would have been a-okay.

4553
02:58:24,850 --> 02:58:25,690
Alright, let's see.

4554
02:58:29,290 --> 02:58:30,550
Alright, nice.

4555
02:58:30,990 --> 02:58:32,130
I want to go all the way back.

4556
02:58:36,530 --> 02:58:38,490
That's right, you ain't no tank no more.

4557
02:58:39,690 --> 02:58:40,630
Get lucky shot?

4558
02:58:40,850 --> 02:58:41,770
Alright, what does it say?

4559
02:58:42,450 --> 02:58:43,310
What do I need?

4560
02:58:44,230 --> 02:58:45,110
Okay, builds.

4561
02:58:45,290 --> 02:58:46,710
I guess I'll get improved reach.

4562
02:58:47,290 --> 02:58:49,530
Wait, what do we imbue-oh, uh...

4563
02:58:49,530 --> 02:58:50,750
What do we get, actually?

4564
02:58:51,530 --> 02:58:51,970
Unstoppable?

4565
02:58:53,690 --> 02:58:54,130
Sure.

4566
02:58:57,370 --> 02:58:58,290
Might as well.

4567
02:58:58,790 --> 02:59:00,810
Now nobody can stop me.

4568
02:59:01,230 --> 02:59:02,510
What does unstoppable do?

4569
02:59:02,610 --> 02:59:04,150
I didn't read, by the way, so...

4570
02:59:04,590 --> 02:59:07,090
I would like to know what it does because I didn't pay attention.

4571
02:59:09,090 --> 02:59:09,530
Wait!

4572
02:59:09,550 --> 02:59:09,670
What?

4573
02:59:09,690 --> 02:59:15,290
Why are you firing-what?

4574
02:59:16,570 --> 02:59:19,770
Okay, I literally just got back.

4575
02:59:22,090 --> 02:59:22,730
Okay.

4576
02:59:23,410 --> 02:59:25,570
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

4577
02:59:28,990 --> 02:59:31,250
Oh no, oh no.

4578
02:59:34,110 --> 02:59:35,450
Oh no, oh no.

4579
02:59:35,450 --> 02:59:36,010
Oh no, oh no.

4580
02:59:37,430 --> 02:59:37,750
Okay.

4581
02:59:39,690 --> 02:59:40,370
That's fucking right.

4582
02:59:43,410 --> 02:59:44,670
What are you doing, man?

4583
02:59:45,030 --> 02:59:45,510
What?

4584
02:59:46,510 --> 02:59:47,350
What are you doing?

4585
02:59:49,150 --> 02:59:51,250
What are you doing?

4586
02:59:52,370 --> 02:59:53,490
Why are you running?

4587
02:59:53,790 --> 02:59:54,870
Why are you running?

4588
02:59:56,310 --> 02:59:57,410
Alright, there we go.

4589
02:59:57,510 --> 02:59:57,870
We're fine.

4590
02:59:58,710 --> 02:59:59,190
Wait!

4591
02:59:59,770 --> 03:00:00,630
Is she back?

4592
03:00:00,950 --> 03:00:00,990
Oh!

4593
03:00:02,270 --> 03:00:03,150
Nice, alright.

4594
03:00:04,370 --> 03:00:05,290
Okay, we did it.

4595
03:00:05,390 --> 03:00:06,150
We saved it.

4596
03:00:07,250 --> 03:00:08,550
We did it, everybody!

4597
03:00:08,550 --> 03:00:09,170
Yay!

4598
03:00:10,530 --> 03:00:12,630
We saved the day!

4599
03:00:13,630 --> 03:00:15,950
We fucking did it!

4600
03:00:17,390 --> 03:00:18,650
Holy fuck!

4601
03:00:20,510 --> 03:00:21,730
That was close.

4602
03:00:22,330 --> 03:00:23,610
Alright, little guys.

4603
03:00:23,870 --> 03:00:25,170
Go do your thing, little guys.

4604
03:00:25,870 --> 03:00:26,650
That's right.

4605
03:00:26,710 --> 03:00:28,390
Holy shit!

4606
03:00:29,950 --> 03:00:31,870
I'm fucking shredding!

4607
03:00:31,890 --> 03:00:33,450
I'm fucking insane!

4608
03:00:34,130 --> 03:00:35,530
Oh no.

4609
03:00:37,590 --> 03:00:38,390
Oh no.

4610
03:00:38,450 --> 03:00:38,530
Oh no.

4611
03:00:38,530 --> 03:00:39,570
I saw the ice beam.

4612
03:00:41,370 --> 03:00:42,710
I saw the ice beam.

4613
03:00:42,770 --> 03:00:44,130
I knew my time was over.

4614
03:00:44,490 --> 03:00:45,990
Oh my god!

4615
03:00:49,170 --> 03:00:49,690
Okay.

4616
03:00:50,570 --> 03:00:51,270
That's fine.

4617
03:00:55,550 --> 03:00:56,710
So you didn't chase me?

4618
03:00:56,990 --> 03:00:57,750
Oh, he knows.

4619
03:00:58,910 --> 03:00:59,730
He knows.

4620
03:01:00,550 --> 03:01:02,790
He doesn't want to chase me no more.

4621
03:01:03,090 --> 03:01:03,610
He...

4622
03:01:03,610 --> 03:01:06,450
He fucking...

4623
03:01:06,450 --> 03:01:07,210
He knows.

4624
03:01:07,210 --> 03:01:08,510
He knows my shot.

4625
03:01:08,690 --> 03:01:10,970
I did that shot, like, twenty times on him.

4626
03:01:11,210 --> 03:01:13,030
He doesn't want to do that again.

4627
03:01:13,650 --> 03:01:15,010
He doesn't want to do that again.

4628
03:01:15,510 --> 03:01:16,610
He likes...

4629
03:01:16,610 --> 03:01:18,050
He knows what I like to do.

4630
03:01:19,970 --> 03:01:20,470
But...

4631
03:01:21,090 --> 03:01:21,590
Umm...

4632
03:01:24,930 --> 03:01:25,930
Good try.

4633
03:01:26,270 --> 03:01:27,390
Good try, guys.

4634
03:01:31,730 --> 03:01:32,730
Good try.

4635
03:01:35,530 --> 03:01:36,150
Oh, yeah?

4636
03:01:37,350 --> 03:01:38,550
That's fucking right.

4637
03:01:38,730 --> 03:01:39,710
Get over here!

4638
03:01:39,730 --> 03:01:39,790
We're here!

4639
03:01:41,430 --> 03:01:41,790
Yeah!

4640
03:01:41,870 --> 03:01:42,050
Oh!

4641
03:01:42,270 --> 03:01:43,670
Okay, that was a little overkill.

4642
03:01:44,050 --> 03:01:44,790
But it's okay.

4643
03:01:45,730 --> 03:01:48,010
That was a little overkill.

4644
03:01:48,310 --> 03:01:49,470
But that's okay.

4645
03:01:51,310 --> 03:01:53,230
Jesus Christ, this game is so long.

4646
03:01:55,370 --> 03:01:56,630
Okay, we just got it.

4647
03:01:56,670 --> 03:01:57,470
Oh hey, there's an urn.

4648
03:01:57,930 --> 03:01:58,450
Oh hey.

4649
03:01:59,090 --> 03:01:59,910
Might as well, right?

4650
03:02:00,130 --> 03:02:01,830
How do I... how do I get this urn?

4651
03:02:04,010 --> 03:02:04,750
How do I... what?

4652
03:02:05,170 --> 03:02:05,870
Is it just here?

4653
03:02:09,730 --> 03:02:10,090
How do I...

4654
03:02:11,250 --> 03:02:12,510
How do I get this urn?

4655
03:02:12,910 --> 03:02:14,390
Oh, it's not there yet.

4656
03:02:14,530 --> 03:02:15,470
Are you serious?

4657
03:02:15,530 --> 03:02:17,590
Who keeps coming back to the base?

4658
03:02:18,490 --> 03:02:19,430
Every time!

4659
03:02:20,670 --> 03:02:22,790
Every fucking time!

4660
03:02:26,290 --> 03:02:27,330
Did he get him?

4661
03:02:28,190 --> 03:02:29,150
Okay, he got him.

4662
03:02:31,970 --> 03:02:34,130
Every... do I need to protect the base?

4663
03:02:34,270 --> 03:02:40,210
I feel like every time I leave the base, something happens!

4664
03:02:41,550 --> 03:02:42,730
Okay, late game.

4665
03:02:43,790 --> 03:02:44,450
What is this?

4666
03:02:44,530 --> 03:02:45,250
Superior stamina?

4667
03:02:45,750 --> 03:02:46,410
Enduring speed?

4668
03:02:46,630 --> 03:02:46,950
Let's go.

4669
03:02:47,470 --> 03:02:49,110
I mean, I have so much money now.

4670
03:02:50,230 --> 03:02:51,250
Oh, lucky shot?

4671
03:02:51,390 --> 03:02:51,650
No!

4672
03:02:51,950 --> 03:02:53,330
Okay, how much is lucky shot?

4673
03:02:59,490 --> 03:03:00,830
How much is lucky shot?

4674
03:03:02,370 --> 03:03:03,250
6.2?

4675
03:03:03,870 --> 03:03:04,310
Okay.

4676
03:03:06,250 --> 03:03:06,690
Alright.

4677
03:03:07,170 --> 03:03:08,670
I'm gonna go over here to help.

4678
03:03:08,790 --> 03:03:10,450
Oh wait, they have the... oh no!

4679
03:03:11,050 --> 03:03:13,190
Wait, they... that's not good.

4680
03:03:14,770 --> 03:03:15,510
That's not good.

4681
03:03:16,150 --> 03:03:17,410
Don't worry, I'm heading over.

4682
03:03:20,810 --> 03:03:21,210
Okay.

4683
03:03:24,870 --> 03:03:26,590
Don't worry, I'm heading over.

4684
03:03:26,730 --> 03:03:27,510
I'll get the urn.

4685
03:03:30,790 --> 03:03:32,050
Don't worry, I got the urn!

4686
03:03:32,190 --> 03:03:33,590
I don't, but like...

4687
03:03:35,490 --> 03:03:36,730
Don't worry, I'm here.

4688
03:03:39,950 --> 03:03:40,530
It's okay!

4689
03:03:41,710 --> 03:03:42,490
We got it!

4690
03:03:45,150 --> 03:03:46,230
Wait, who has the spirit urn?

4691
03:03:46,310 --> 03:03:47,150
Who has it?

4692
03:03:47,470 --> 03:03:48,510
Oh, here it is.

4693
03:03:52,970 --> 03:03:54,170
I got it.

4694
03:03:55,810 --> 03:03:56,790
I got it.

4695
03:03:56,790 --> 03:03:57,430
I'm so fast.

4696
03:03:57,770 --> 03:03:59,110
I'm so fucking fast.

4697
03:04:00,230 --> 03:04:02,030
I put all my buff on speed.

4698
03:04:02,230 --> 03:04:03,090
That's fucking right.

4699
03:04:03,190 --> 03:04:03,430
Zoom!

4700
03:04:04,850 --> 03:04:05,330
Zoom!

4701
03:04:06,950 --> 03:04:09,290
I don't know where it is, but zoom!

4702
03:04:10,630 --> 03:04:12,310
Where do I drop it off?

4703
03:04:13,330 --> 03:04:14,390
Oh, there it is.

4704
03:04:15,150 --> 03:04:15,970
I'm so fucking fast.

4705
03:04:17,070 --> 03:04:17,590
Nice.

4706
03:04:17,690 --> 03:04:18,630
I didn't even have to dash.

4707
03:04:19,630 --> 03:04:20,190
Let's go.

4708
03:04:23,110 --> 03:04:24,830
I literally had to...

4709
03:04:24,830 --> 03:04:29,250
I literally just had all my buffs on speed, so it worked out.

4710
03:04:29,990 --> 03:04:31,410
It actually worked out.

4711
03:04:31,430 --> 03:04:31,850
That's crazy.

4712
03:04:36,750 --> 03:04:37,470
It's okay.

4713
03:04:38,190 --> 03:04:39,790
We don't need the orbs yet.

4714
03:04:39,790 --> 03:04:39,910
Let's get it.

4715
03:04:42,450 --> 03:04:43,010
Okay.

4716
03:04:43,290 --> 03:04:45,510
This little merry-go-round is a little stupid.

4717
03:04:47,710 --> 03:04:49,510
No, our base is okay!

4718
03:04:51,850 --> 03:04:52,670
Oh, god.

4719
03:04:53,050 --> 03:04:53,910
Oh, god.

4720
03:04:55,910 --> 03:04:56,470
Oh.

4721
03:04:57,330 --> 03:04:58,110
Wait, what?

4722
03:04:59,430 --> 03:05:00,550
Oh, no.

4723
03:05:00,750 --> 03:05:01,570
Oh, no.

4724
03:05:02,010 --> 03:05:02,570
Zoom!

4725
03:05:03,190 --> 03:05:03,730
Zoom!

4726
03:05:05,630 --> 03:05:06,570
Where is he?

4727
03:05:07,850 --> 03:05:08,790
Where is he?

4728
03:05:09,870 --> 03:05:10,430
Where is he?

4729
03:05:10,430 --> 03:05:11,330
Oh, you think...

4730
03:05:11,330 --> 03:05:13,570
You think I'm gonna let you do that?

4731
03:05:13,690 --> 03:05:14,830
That's fucking right.

4732
03:05:15,590 --> 03:05:16,730
Let's get over here.

4733
03:05:17,050 --> 03:05:18,890
Get your ass over here.

4734
03:05:19,550 --> 03:05:20,670
Get your...

4735
03:05:21,350 --> 03:05:22,110
Oh, shit.

4736
03:05:22,370 --> 03:05:23,150
There we go.

4737
03:05:24,130 --> 03:05:25,530
That's fucking right.

4738
03:05:27,170 --> 03:05:29,490
Why does no one defend base?

4739
03:05:29,610 --> 03:05:30,770
Why is it always me?

4740
03:05:32,430 --> 03:05:35,390
Why am I always the one defending the base?

4741
03:05:37,050 --> 03:05:39,550
I literally have the highest DPS.

4742
03:05:42,610 --> 03:05:43,370
No!

4743
03:05:45,970 --> 03:05:48,290
Please, this game is so lag.

4744
03:05:50,570 --> 03:05:53,650
This game has been going on forever.

4745
03:05:53,790 --> 03:05:54,550
Please.

4746
03:05:58,390 --> 03:06:00,110
Oh, my god.

4747
03:06:00,210 --> 03:06:01,770
I will kill you.

4748
03:06:02,310 --> 03:06:03,590
My lucky shot.

4749
03:06:03,650 --> 03:06:04,810
Oh, I can afford lucky shot now.

4750
03:06:04,970 --> 03:06:05,170
Okay.

4751
03:06:07,070 --> 03:06:07,550
Okay.

4752
03:06:09,210 --> 03:06:10,090
Lucky shot.

4753
03:06:11,870 --> 03:06:12,350
Lucky...

4754
03:06:12,350 --> 03:06:13,390
This one.

4755
03:06:14,530 --> 03:06:14,790
Alright.

4756
03:06:17,110 --> 03:06:18,050
Okay, there we go.

4757
03:06:18,090 --> 03:06:18,950
We gotta push hard.

4758
03:06:19,090 --> 03:06:19,950
I'm heading over.

4759
03:06:20,450 --> 03:06:23,130
I'm heading over as fast as I can.

4760
03:06:23,910 --> 03:06:25,310
I swear to god.

4761
03:06:25,970 --> 03:06:27,110
I feel like...

4762
03:06:27,110 --> 03:06:33,890
I feel like no... Someone's just flanking into the base and I always have to be the one to defend the base.

4763
03:06:34,150 --> 03:06:35,010
Every time.

4764
03:06:38,760 --> 03:06:40,740
I swear to fucking god.

4765
03:06:40,940 --> 03:06:41,720
There we go!

4766
03:06:41,760 --> 03:06:42,380
We did it!

4767
03:06:43,020 --> 03:06:44,900
It was nearly that easy!

4768
03:06:46,780 --> 03:06:48,500
It was that easy.

4769
03:06:54,600 --> 03:06:55,460
Here we go.

4770
03:06:56,500 --> 03:06:57,280
Here we go.

4771
03:07:02,210 --> 03:07:03,250
Alright, here we go.

4772
03:07:03,750 --> 03:07:04,930
This should work, right?

4773
03:07:06,250 --> 03:07:07,250
Yeah, nice.

4774
03:07:08,230 --> 03:07:08,710
Oh, shit.

4775
03:07:10,070 --> 03:07:10,770
That's fine.

4776
03:07:10,850 --> 03:07:11,350
This is fine.

4777
03:07:11,390 --> 03:07:11,930
This is fine.

4778
03:07:12,430 --> 03:07:13,250
This is fine.

4779
03:07:15,450 --> 03:07:16,410
This is fine.

4780
03:07:17,510 --> 03:07:18,030
So

4781
03:07:21,610 --> 03:07:22,130
much!

4782
03:07:24,850 --> 03:07:25,550
That's fine.

4783
03:07:25,730 --> 03:07:26,430
This is fine.

4784
03:07:27,930 --> 03:07:28,870
Oh, grab that.

4785
03:07:29,370 --> 03:07:30,770
We're not fine!

4786
03:07:39,800 --> 03:07:41,040
Okay, guys.

4787
03:07:42,120 --> 03:07:44,580
What the fuck is my DPS?

4788
03:07:44,580 --> 03:07:46,580
Holy shit!

4789
03:07:47,860 --> 03:07:50,140
What the fuck is wrong with my build?

4790
03:07:50,580 --> 03:07:57,010
What the fuck is wrong with my build?

4791
03:07:57,370 --> 03:07:57,890
What the fuck is wrong with my build?

4792
03:07:57,890 --> 03:07:59,050
Oh my god!

4793
03:07:59,610 --> 03:08:01,010
This is actually...

4794
03:08:01,010 --> 03:08:02,690
Oh no, now they're gonna hard push.

4795
03:08:06,150 --> 03:08:07,770
Oh my god.

4796
03:08:07,790 --> 03:08:08,410
Oh no.

4797
03:08:08,890 --> 03:08:10,030
Oh my god.

4798
03:08:10,230 --> 03:08:12,030
Perry makes it so that the...

4799
03:08:12,840 --> 03:08:14,130
Abrams can't do jack shit.

4800
03:08:17,750 --> 03:08:18,770
Perry makes it so that the...

4801
03:08:18,770 --> 03:08:19,130
Oh no.

4802
03:08:19,250 --> 03:08:20,330
It's okay, I'm coming back.

4803
03:08:20,470 --> 03:08:20,910
It's okay.

4804
03:08:21,310 --> 03:08:22,750
It's okay, I'm here already.

4805
03:08:23,370 --> 03:08:24,950
We're so okay, guys.

4806
03:08:25,050 --> 03:08:25,570
We're here.

4807
03:08:25,810 --> 03:08:27,270
We're here to defend.

4808
03:08:27,930 --> 03:08:29,710
We can defend this, don't worry.

4809
03:08:31,510 --> 03:08:33,570
We just gotta figure out where they're gonna come from.

4810
03:08:33,730 --> 03:08:34,450
We just gotta figure out where they're gonna come from.

4811
03:08:34,450 --> 03:08:38,750
This has been a 31 minute game.

4812
03:08:39,130 --> 03:08:39,170
This has been a 31 minute game.

4813
03:08:40,470 --> 03:08:42,130
Oh no, there's the Abrams.

4814
03:08:42,250 --> 03:08:43,070
I see you.

4815
03:08:43,830 --> 03:08:45,570
I see the Abrams.

4816
03:08:45,570 --> 03:08:49,190
I will fight the Abrams to the last breath.

4817
03:08:52,250 --> 03:08:55,330
I will fight you to the last breath.

4818
03:08:55,650 --> 03:08:55,690
I will fight you to the last breath.

4819
03:08:55,690 --> 03:08:56,450
I will fight you to the last breath.

4820
03:08:56,970 --> 03:08:57,890
Oh no.

4821
03:08:58,550 --> 03:08:59,770
That's fucking right.

4822
03:09:01,570 --> 03:09:02,610
That's fucking right.

4823
03:09:02,670 --> 03:09:03,650
I'm gonna go help my team now.

4824
03:09:06,930 --> 03:09:08,230
What the fuck?

4825
03:09:08,470 --> 03:09:08,790
What the fuck?

4826
03:09:09,710 --> 03:09:11,070
Holy shit.

4827
03:09:13,870 --> 03:09:14,550
Okay.

4828
03:09:15,130 --> 03:09:16,130
Here we go.

4829
03:09:21,350 --> 03:09:22,710
Oh shit.

4830
03:09:22,810 --> 03:09:24,290
I felt like I just got stopped.

4831
03:09:24,790 --> 03:09:25,470
Right there.

4832
03:09:27,070 --> 03:09:28,370
I parried.

4833
03:09:28,850 --> 03:09:30,410
Guys, did you see that?

4834
03:09:30,490 --> 03:09:32,010
I actually parried.

4835
03:09:32,890 --> 03:09:33,970
Holy shit.

4836
03:09:38,010 --> 03:09:39,630
Bro, I actually parried there.

4837
03:09:41,150 --> 03:09:42,690
She did it.

4838
03:09:43,890 --> 03:09:45,010
Holy fuck.

4839
03:09:45,710 --> 03:09:46,750
Okay, let's go.

4840
03:09:47,170 --> 03:09:48,710
Let's fucking go.

4841
03:09:48,950 --> 03:09:50,470
Okay, we gotta push now.

4842
03:09:50,870 --> 03:09:52,110
I swear to god.

4843
03:09:52,190 --> 03:09:55,470
If you guys don't push after that, I swear the fuck you got.

4844
03:09:55,810 --> 03:09:58,730
I swear to god.

4845
03:09:59,530 --> 03:10:00,350
I'm learning.

4846
03:10:02,010 --> 03:10:03,510
Our guy's going in.

4847
03:10:03,630 --> 03:10:03,950
I swear to god.

4848
03:10:07,170 --> 03:10:07,770
Come on.

4849
03:10:08,710 --> 03:10:10,830
I'm going there as fast as I can.

4850
03:10:13,970 --> 03:10:14,490
Okay.

4851
03:10:15,370 --> 03:10:16,010
I'm in.

4852
03:10:16,630 --> 03:10:17,310
I'm in.

4853
03:10:17,370 --> 03:10:17,850
Now it's asleep.

4854
03:10:18,150 --> 03:10:20,410
It's not gonna do anything, but it's asleep now.

4855
03:10:23,390 --> 03:10:26,270
It doesn't do anything, but it's asleep.

4856
03:10:26,470 --> 03:10:27,310
We did it.

4857
03:10:29,210 --> 03:10:30,770
Oh my god.

4858
03:10:31,070 --> 03:10:31,590
Finally.

4859
03:10:31,950 --> 03:10:33,150
I swear.

4860
03:10:33,150 --> 03:10:33,550
I swear.

4861
03:10:33,550 --> 03:10:36,290
I was gonna fucking play this game forever.

4862
03:10:36,770 --> 03:10:38,570
This one game.

4863
03:10:38,970 --> 03:10:40,310
Jesus Christ.

4864
03:10:41,450 --> 03:10:44,390
What the fuck is this build?

4865
03:10:45,170 --> 03:10:46,490
Jesus Christ.

4866
03:10:46,990 --> 03:10:49,030
This is so stupid.

4867
03:10:52,730 --> 03:10:53,650
That's LG.

4868
03:10:53,790 --> 03:10:55,330
That was a good game to end it on.

4869
03:10:55,470 --> 03:11:00,310
That was a good game to end it on.

4870
03:11:00,310 --> 03:11:01,430
Oh my god.

4871
03:11:01,490 --> 03:11:01,830
25.

4872
03:11:01,990 --> 03:11:03,850
I told you I didn't need my friend.

4873
03:11:04,090 --> 03:11:05,810
I literally could solo carry this team.

4874
03:11:07,810 --> 03:11:09,950
Nexi, thank you for the five gift chips.

4875
03:11:10,250 --> 03:11:10,570
Thank you.

4876
03:11:12,150 --> 03:11:13,670
Oh my god.

4877
03:11:14,310 --> 03:11:15,190
I swear.

4878
03:11:15,350 --> 03:11:18,450
This is the only thing I didn't like about Deadlock.

4879
03:11:18,490 --> 03:11:20,650
Is that the games are just so long.

4880
03:11:21,330 --> 03:11:22,070
It's just...

4881
03:11:22,950 --> 03:11:24,710
It's so long.

4882
03:11:27,090 --> 03:11:29,470
I'm not an Abrams one trick.

4883
03:11:29,570 --> 03:11:32,270
I'm an ace Abrams two trick.

4884
03:11:32,650 --> 03:11:33,290
I'm an ace Abrams two trick.

4885
03:11:39,130 --> 03:11:41,630
The unstoppable with y'all was pretty good.

4886
03:11:41,750 --> 03:11:41,810
The unstoppable with y'all was pretty good.

4887
03:11:41,810 --> 03:11:42,770
That was actually pretty nasty.

4888
03:11:43,070 --> 03:11:46,230
I chased the Abrams away so he couldn't counter me.

4889
03:11:46,750 --> 03:11:49,370
I chased the Abrams away so he couldn't counter me.

4890
03:11:49,370 --> 03:11:50,730
Nerd Bryce was really good.

4891
03:11:50,990 --> 03:11:52,670
Not one trick.

4892
03:11:52,730 --> 03:11:53,270
Let's go.

4893
03:11:58,230 --> 03:11:58,790
Oh.

4894
03:11:58,970 --> 03:11:59,030
Also.

4895
03:11:59,470 --> 03:12:01,690
Thank you for the super sticker.

4896
03:12:01,910 --> 03:12:02,290
Thank you.

4897
03:12:02,370 --> 03:12:05,610
Thank you for the five gift chips.

4898
03:12:05,890 --> 03:12:06,170
Thank you.

4899
03:12:06,670 --> 03:12:08,190
I really appreciate it.

4900
03:12:08,230 --> 03:12:08,950
Thank you so much.

4901
03:12:09,210 --> 03:12:11,170
I'm going to swap over now.

4902
03:12:12,170 --> 03:12:14,030
How do I like Deadlock?

4903
03:12:14,830 --> 03:12:16,650
I'm in literally noob lobby.

4904
03:12:16,930 --> 03:12:19,650
I can't really give my opinion so far.

4905
03:12:19,830 --> 03:12:20,890
On Deadlock.

4906
03:12:21,170 --> 03:12:22,250
That was LG.

4907
03:12:25,610 --> 03:12:26,410
I'm sorry.

4908
03:12:27,490 --> 03:12:28,990
That was LG for me.

4909
03:12:30,790 --> 03:12:31,270
But...

4910
03:12:31,850 --> 03:12:34,910
I can't really give my opinion so far.

4911
03:12:35,030 --> 03:12:35,910
I can't really give my opinion so far.

4912
03:12:35,910 --> 03:12:36,710
I think honestly...

4913
03:12:40,150 --> 03:12:41,670
It's because I'm in low elo.

4914
03:12:42,510 --> 03:12:42,990
It's because I'm in low elo.

4915
03:12:42,990 --> 03:12:45,970
It's not as tilting as in high elo.

4916
03:12:46,130 --> 03:12:48,830
Because when I play with my friends, my friends are high elo and I don't know what I'm doing.

4917
03:12:50,910 --> 03:12:53,130
That's what tilts me.

4918
03:12:53,130 --> 03:12:54,350
Because you know...

4919
03:12:54,350 --> 03:12:54,850
People...

4920
03:12:55,810 --> 03:12:58,310
The MMR is harder.

4921
03:12:58,970 --> 03:13:02,810
But in this MMR, it's fun because I can aim.

4922
03:13:03,190 --> 03:13:03,550
Like...

4923
03:13:06,030 --> 03:13:07,190
I can...

4924
03:13:07,190 --> 03:13:09,550
I have reaction time.

4925
03:13:09,810 --> 03:13:13,990
I have reaction time and aim skills from other FPS games.

4926
03:13:14,450 --> 03:13:14,610
I have reaction time and aim skills from other FPS games.

4927
03:13:14,610 --> 03:13:15,150
So like...

4928
03:13:17,150 --> 03:13:20,770
It's easier for me to adapt by just pure aim.

4929
03:13:21,030 --> 03:13:21,790
And like...

4930
03:13:23,130 --> 03:13:23,390
And stuff.

4931
03:13:24,470 --> 03:13:25,030
And...

4932
03:13:25,030 --> 03:13:28,490
And just comboing and stuff.

4933
03:13:32,650 --> 03:13:36,870
So that's what's currently carrying me at the moment.

4934
03:13:38,310 --> 03:13:39,670
The transferable skills.

4935
03:13:39,990 --> 03:13:42,990
It is fun in the lower elo.

4936
03:13:43,170 --> 03:13:44,990
I think the higher elo you go...

4937
03:13:45,970 --> 03:13:50,870
Because the higher elo I was when I was playing with my friends, I was so frustrated.

4938
03:13:50,870 --> 03:13:53,590
I was so fucking frustrated in the higher elo.

4939
03:13:53,750 --> 03:13:56,810
But in this elo and just fucking around, it was really fun.

4940
03:13:57,110 --> 03:13:59,310
I know I'm not the... what's her name?

4941
03:13:59,430 --> 03:14:00,090
The feet girl?

4942
03:14:00,310 --> 03:14:01,390
I was definitely not that.

4943
03:14:01,650 --> 03:14:04,810
I was definitely not that.

4944
03:14:05,070 --> 03:14:09,030
I was more of a Haze and Abram player.

4945
03:14:09,330 --> 03:14:11,230
It gets really sweaty really fast.

4946
03:14:11,330 --> 03:14:12,750
But I wish matches had a fixed time.

4947
03:14:12,930 --> 03:14:14,050
Yeah, me too.

4948
03:14:14,870 --> 03:14:16,410
The lane part...

4949
03:14:16,410 --> 03:14:18,270
The lane part is where I go crazy.

4950
03:14:18,270 --> 03:14:21,090
Because the lane part is where the MOBA aspect is.

4951
03:14:21,450 --> 03:14:23,450
That's where you get the MOBA feeling.

4952
03:14:23,830 --> 03:14:26,590
And then when you're out of the lane phase...

4953
03:14:26,590 --> 03:14:27,610
Because you guys were telling me...

4954
03:14:28,210 --> 03:14:30,730
Toki, you're not supposed to get out the lane yet.

4955
03:14:30,810 --> 03:14:33,250
You're supposed to wait until the first 10 minutes.

4956
03:14:33,390 --> 03:14:33,970
What are you doing?

4957
03:14:34,090 --> 03:14:34,890
Why are you roaming?

4958
03:14:35,290 --> 03:14:37,270
But I don't want to...

4959
03:14:37,270 --> 03:14:39,270
I don't want to lane anymore.

4960
03:14:42,670 --> 03:14:43,850
I'm just like...

4961
03:14:43,850 --> 03:14:46,430
I don't want to lane anymore.

4962
03:14:46,430 --> 03:14:48,250
I just want to...

4963
03:14:48,270 --> 03:14:48,970
I just want to walk around.

4964
03:14:52,290 --> 03:14:53,290
I know.

4965
03:14:53,850 --> 03:14:55,910
Because that's the...

4966
03:14:55,910 --> 03:14:58,370
That's like the MOBA part.

4967
03:14:58,670 --> 03:14:59,610
And like my...

4968
03:14:59,610 --> 03:15:01,530
My patience gets me.

4969
03:15:04,010 --> 03:15:07,910
My patience in the first 10 minutes is where I go crazy.

4970
03:15:08,090 --> 03:15:09,430
I go fucking crazy.

4971
03:15:09,630 --> 03:15:12,170
Because you guys saw me pushing in so many times.

4972
03:15:12,430 --> 03:15:18,250
I think my partner there got so frustrated at me trying to solo push two players by myself.

4973
03:15:18,270 --> 03:15:19,830
That she swapped lanes.

4974
03:15:20,030 --> 03:15:21,890
I think that's why she swapped lanes.

4975
03:15:22,170 --> 03:15:24,050
Because I was like, where did she go?

4976
03:15:24,330 --> 03:15:25,950
Why did my partner left me?

4977
03:15:26,330 --> 03:15:28,070
And I think it's because I kept...

4978
03:15:28,070 --> 03:15:29,670
I kept trying to push.

4979
03:15:29,870 --> 03:15:31,290
But I'm like so squishy.

4980
03:15:33,790 --> 03:15:35,390
And then she left.

4981
03:15:35,650 --> 03:15:37,550
And then she left my lane.

4982
03:15:37,630 --> 03:15:39,570
Because she got fucking tired of me.

4983
03:15:44,010 --> 03:15:45,130
But yeah.

4984
03:15:45,390 --> 03:15:45,950
Honestly.

4985
03:15:45,950 --> 03:15:47,290
I don't...

4986
03:15:47,290 --> 03:15:49,910
I personally don't like the...

4987
03:15:49,910 --> 03:15:51,390
The prep...

4988
03:15:51,390 --> 03:15:53,850
I personally just don't like the lane part.

4989
03:15:54,030 --> 03:15:55,750
I know that's like the most...

4990
03:15:55,750 --> 03:15:57,530
The most important part.

4991
03:15:57,750 --> 03:15:58,830
In a MOBA.

4992
03:15:59,110 --> 03:16:01,170
But it's just so... Oh my god.

4993
03:16:01,790 --> 03:16:02,910
Oh my god.

4994
03:16:02,970 --> 03:16:05,170
But then when you get your build, it's worth it.

4995
03:16:05,250 --> 03:16:05,750
When you...

4996
03:16:06,770 --> 03:16:08,990
When you become a fucking god.

4997
03:16:09,290 --> 03:16:10,410
It's worth it.

4998
03:16:12,550 --> 03:16:13,390
It's just...

4999
03:16:13,390 --> 03:16:14,950
I have to have the patience.

5000
03:16:15,950 --> 03:16:16,510
To fucking...

5001
03:16:16,510 --> 03:16:18,530
I have to have the patience.

5002
03:16:18,710 --> 03:16:20,450
To become a god.

5003
03:16:24,510 --> 03:16:25,710
A god.

5004
03:16:25,790 --> 03:16:25,970
Yeah.

5005
03:16:26,050 --> 03:16:28,010
Did you not see me fucking become...

5006
03:16:28,710 --> 03:16:29,310
Unstoppable?

5007
03:16:30,470 --> 03:16:31,970
Unstoppable with my ult.

5008
03:16:32,050 --> 03:16:32,950
And I killed like...

5009
03:16:32,950 --> 03:16:35,050
4 plus players from that.

5010
03:16:35,190 --> 03:16:36,590
That shit was fucking crazy.

5011
03:16:36,890 --> 03:16:39,870
I chased away the Abram because he saw me.

5012
03:16:40,070 --> 03:16:41,570
And then I chased him away.

5013
03:16:42,030 --> 03:16:43,570
And then I fucking...

5014
03:16:43,570 --> 03:16:45,830
Now that I know I can't get ult cancelled.

5015
03:16:49,350 --> 03:16:52,450
Now that I know I can't get ult cancelled.

5016
03:16:52,710 --> 03:16:52,950
Now that I know I can't get ult cancelled.

5017
03:16:52,950 --> 03:16:54,070
I ulted him.

5018
03:16:55,110 --> 03:16:58,330
As soon as Doki learns how to wait 10 minutes, it's over.

5019
03:16:58,450 --> 03:17:00,190
She achieved godhood.

5020
03:17:01,190 --> 03:17:03,770
And then I parried him too.

5021
03:17:04,890 --> 03:17:05,410
Anyway.

5022
03:17:05,710 --> 03:17:07,150
That's how I feel currently.

5023
03:17:07,630 --> 03:17:08,330
But yeah.

5024
03:17:08,570 --> 03:17:11,270
I feel like it's definitely when you understand the game.

5025
03:17:11,730 --> 03:17:14,650
When you understand it, it does get more fun.

5026
03:17:14,890 --> 03:17:15,910
When you understand it, it does get more fun.

5027
03:17:15,950 --> 03:17:16,030
I'm sure.

5028
03:17:16,110 --> 03:17:20,330
When he gave me the quick crash course.

5029
03:17:20,570 --> 03:17:22,530
On two specific characters.

5030
03:17:23,390 --> 03:17:25,630
He tried to teach me two specific characters.

5031
03:17:25,890 --> 03:17:27,430
Because he's like, I think you'll like these two characters.

5032
03:17:27,770 --> 03:17:29,750
It definitely got more fun for me.

5033
03:17:29,830 --> 03:17:31,950
Because I understood the combos.

5034
03:17:31,990 --> 03:17:32,590
And everything.

5035
03:17:32,870 --> 03:17:35,150
And how to actually sort of play the game.

5036
03:17:35,350 --> 03:17:36,150
But not really.

5037
03:17:36,310 --> 03:17:38,810
Because you guys are like, please start farming creeps.

5038
03:17:38,910 --> 03:17:40,170
But I was farming players.

5039
03:17:40,170 --> 03:17:40,690
Like...

5040
03:17:42,550 --> 03:17:43,670
The majority.

5041
03:17:43,830 --> 03:17:45,930
The majority of my farm.

5042
03:17:45,970 --> 03:17:47,590
Was the players themselves.

5043
03:17:48,330 --> 03:17:50,250
Not from the actual creeps.

5044
03:17:50,890 --> 03:17:51,510
Because I was like.

5045
03:17:51,890 --> 03:17:52,930
I was like, no!

5046
03:17:53,250 --> 03:17:55,250
I want to farm the players.

5047
03:18:00,950 --> 03:18:01,510
Yeah.

5048
03:18:02,570 --> 03:18:05,350
You guys helping with backseating helped a lot too.

5049
03:18:06,690 --> 03:18:07,250
Yeah.

5050
03:18:07,350 --> 03:18:08,070
We're not playing.

5051
03:18:08,270 --> 03:18:08,510
We're not.

5052
03:18:10,790 --> 03:18:12,150
Vindicto is not it.

5053
03:18:17,090 --> 03:18:18,450
Please thank you for the super chat.

5054
03:18:18,550 --> 03:18:18,730
Thank you.

5055
03:18:18,870 --> 03:18:19,170
Thank you.

5056
03:18:19,170 --> 03:18:20,630
Peak strategy is to play as Ivy.

5057
03:18:20,810 --> 03:18:23,850
Use your ability to fly and throw your teammate directly into a 7.

5058
03:18:23,970 --> 03:18:25,030
Alt then post in chat.

5059
03:18:25,190 --> 03:18:26,730
What the fuck are you doing?

5060
03:18:26,850 --> 03:18:28,250
Thank you for the super chat.

5061
03:18:28,350 --> 03:18:28,630
Thank you.

5062
03:18:29,510 --> 03:18:32,190
I hope you guys enjoyed watching that.

5063
03:18:32,770 --> 03:18:33,850
Watching the game.

5064
03:18:33,990 --> 03:18:37,090
Because I know it does get a little boring to watch.

5065
03:18:37,230 --> 03:18:39,970
When you're just trying to fucking become a guy.

5066
03:18:40,170 --> 03:18:40,510
Like.

5067
03:18:41,770 --> 03:18:42,790
When you're.

5068
03:18:43,910 --> 03:18:46,430
When you're trying to become a guy.

5069
03:18:46,610 --> 03:18:48,110
It's where it gets like.

5070
03:18:48,230 --> 03:18:49,450
We're like, what the fuck do we do?

5071
03:18:49,630 --> 03:18:52,490
So I hope you guys still had fun watching.

5072
03:18:52,650 --> 03:18:53,790
Yeah, I made someone rage quit.

5073
03:18:53,910 --> 03:18:54,430
Look.

5074
03:18:56,050 --> 03:18:58,130
All I'm saying is that.

5075
03:18:58,170 --> 03:19:00,430
When I got into the closed beta.

5076
03:19:00,590 --> 03:19:02,390
When Deadlock had no name.

5077
03:19:04,430 --> 03:19:05,590
That was me.

5078
03:19:05,890 --> 03:19:07,290
And you know what was worse?

5079
03:19:07,290 --> 03:19:09,230
They were not regular players.

5080
03:19:09,470 --> 03:19:10,670
They were streamers.

5081
03:19:10,750 --> 03:19:12,090
So I got.

5082
03:19:12,210 --> 03:19:14,170
I was that guy.

5083
03:19:14,430 --> 03:19:16,650
And then the person that was me.

5084
03:19:16,810 --> 03:19:18,130
Farming that baby.

5085
03:19:18,270 --> 03:19:19,570
Was Dyrus.

5086
03:19:20,470 --> 03:19:21,910
And Surefort.

5087
03:19:22,850 --> 03:19:24,370
Dyrus and Surefort.

5088
03:19:24,370 --> 03:19:26,650
Just hardtuttled me.

5089
03:19:26,790 --> 03:19:29,290
On my very first game.

5090
03:19:30,210 --> 03:19:32,330
And that is a lot worse.

5091
03:19:32,730 --> 03:19:35,070
Because I actually couldn't plug.

5092
03:19:35,490 --> 03:19:37,270
Because I was in a stream.

5093
03:19:37,270 --> 03:19:38,210
Streamer lobby.

5094
03:19:38,550 --> 03:19:40,470
So I couldn't leave.

5095
03:19:43,910 --> 03:19:46,790
I was in a full on.

5096
03:19:47,590 --> 03:19:49,090
Streamer content creator.

5097
03:19:49,130 --> 03:19:49,830
Lobby.

5098
03:19:49,950 --> 03:19:51,770
But I couldn't leave.

5099
03:19:51,970 --> 03:19:54,050
And it was my first game.

5100
03:19:54,290 --> 03:19:56,970
And they all have already played.

5101
03:19:57,150 --> 03:19:59,150
For like weeks already.

5102
03:20:03,370 --> 03:20:04,070
So.

5103
03:20:05,270 --> 03:20:06,650
That baby.

5104
03:20:07,870 --> 03:20:08,870
Deserved it.

5105
03:20:09,210 --> 03:20:10,430
If I.

5106
03:20:10,870 --> 03:20:12,470
Had to do that.

5107
03:20:12,690 --> 03:20:14,830
If I had to live through that.

5108
03:20:15,030 --> 03:20:17,170
He had to live through that.

5109
03:20:17,570 --> 03:20:19,250
I think that's called.

5110
03:20:19,390 --> 03:20:20,110
Karma.

5111
03:20:23,150 --> 03:20:24,810
So I continued.

5112
03:20:25,110 --> 03:20:26,310
The cycle.

5113
03:20:27,470 --> 03:20:29,590
The cycle continues.

5114
03:20:29,950 --> 03:20:31,590
I paid it forward.

5115
03:20:31,770 --> 03:20:32,210
Exactly.

5116
03:20:32,370 --> 03:20:34,730
I was paying it forward.

5117
03:20:37,270 --> 03:20:37,530
Hahaha.

5118
03:20:39,070 --> 03:20:39,550
Um.

5119
03:20:40,370 --> 03:20:40,810
Yeah.

5120
03:20:41,010 --> 03:20:43,090
I hope you guys had a great time watching.

5121
03:20:43,110 --> 03:20:43,570
Everybody.

5122
03:20:45,110 --> 03:20:47,670
I'm going to take a break now.

5123
03:20:47,690 --> 03:20:48,590
Rest my voice today.

5124
03:20:48,670 --> 03:20:51,550
This week has been a long week of streaming.

5125
03:20:51,790 --> 03:20:54,270
I am going to rest up now.

5126
03:20:54,790 --> 03:20:55,730
As always.

5127
03:20:56,130 --> 03:20:58,010
Stay hydrated.

5128
03:20:58,430 --> 03:20:59,010
Posture check.

5129
03:20:59,130 --> 03:20:59,810
Get up and move around.

5130
03:20:59,990 --> 03:21:00,870
To get that blood flowing.

5131
03:21:00,870 --> 03:21:04,830
And if you stay up for me, head to bed, because you deserve it.

5132
03:21:04,890 --> 03:21:06,070
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

5133
03:21:06,590 --> 03:21:07,430
Bye, guys.

5134
03:21:08,010 --> 03:21:08,470
Bye.
