00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:49,830
Hello.

2
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,330
Good morning, everybody.

3
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:53,750
Whoa.

4
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:54,970
Good morning.

5
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:59,550
I am... I thought 12 p.m.

6
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,730
12.30 p.m.

7
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:01,350
was bad.

8
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:08,510
But then... But then I found out there is an even harder time slot.

9
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,910
And it's 12... And it's 10 in the morning.

10
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:17,750
Now you guys might be wondering... Like... Oh, hey.

11
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,470
Hey, Tokyo.

12
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,530
Come on.

13
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:22,230
Get on.

14
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,410
Get on the game.

15
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,190
Weren't you on the game yet?

16
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,310
Because they did say... At 10 a.m.

17
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:33,750
At 10 a.m.

18
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,450
there's apparently a population cap.

19
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,170
Which is fucking crazy.

20
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:45,210
Because... I thought... I thought... People who have access to this game... Are mostly just creators.

21
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,330
And... Oh, wait.

22
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:47,610
I'm in.

23
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:48,050
Never mind.

24
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:48,390
Ha-ha.

25
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:50,710
JK.

26
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,650
I take back everything I just said.

27
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:58,470
I... I'm in.

28
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,030
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

29
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,830
I take it all back.

30
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:07,530
Um... But... The issue right now... Is that... I can't click... Accept.

31
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,250
Wait.

32
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,430
Why is my mouse not working... On this game?

33
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:11,630
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

34
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,450
Wait a minute.

35
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:13,910
Oh, there we go.

36
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,070
Oh, did my game?

37
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:15,930
No way.

38
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,590
There's no fucking way.

39
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:20,290
Oh, my God.

40
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,430
There's no way.

41
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,850
I can't move my mouse.

42
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,890
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

43
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:57,970
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha Why can't I move my mouse when I'm tapped into the game?

44
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,290
Like, what?

45
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,030
Why can't I move my mouse?

46
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,410
That's so weird.

47
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,430
Okay, guys, we're gonna wait even longer.

48
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:11,130
Oh, this sucks because there is a population cap.

49
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,150
So, like, this is gonna be so...

50
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,770
Oh, wait.

51
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,330
Like, what?

52
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:17,910
Is it because it's on DX12?

53
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,400
Oh, my God.

54
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,260
Guys, all right, guys.

55
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,420
We're gonna have to wait even longer, apparently.

56
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:34,720
Because we might have got in, but we're not in.

57
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,580
We're not in anymore.

58
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,020
So, there's a population.

59
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,840
This releases a little scuff, not gonna lie.

60
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,540
Is it cloud test?

61
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,460
It must be.

62
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,860
I can't... I literally can't move my... Oh, man.

63
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,580
I have to wait.

64
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,900
I have to wait even more.

65
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,440
Because I... I, like, booted up, man.

66
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,260
Oh, my God.

67
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,700
It's, like, actually fucking up my PC right now.

68
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,460
Oh, man.

69
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,120
Oh, fuck.

70
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:07,500
Wait.

71
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,040
Oh, my God.

72
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,820
I can't even...

73
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,300
I can't task, man.

74
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,100
What the fuck is going on?

75
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,620
Oh, my God.

76
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,320
As you... No, it's not.

77
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,600
The game literally launches at 10.

78
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,820
Like, I can't do anything about it.

79
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,000
Um, they launch at exactly 10 a.m.

80
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,040
So, I can't test it out at all.

81
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,080
There's... There's no way to test it out.

82
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,560
Because, um, it launches at that time.

83
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:31,380
Uh...

84
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,520
And they put a population cap, too.

85
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,140
So, like... Oh, no.

86
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:36,620
Not to...

87
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,200
I'm scared.

88
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,940
I'm scared, like, I have to wait even longer.

89
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,060
Because, um...

90
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,400
I got on exactly at 10.

91
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:44,980
And...

92
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,060
And I'm really scared that...

93
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:49,820
Uh...

94
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,280
I'm really scared that we have to wait even longer.

95
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,320
I thought...

96
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,160
No, it's because, like, um...

97
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,300
I have to force quit the game.

98
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,260
I'm... I have to force quit the game there.

99
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,000
So, because I have to force quit...

100
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,200
Uh... Oh, thank God.

101
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,360
Oh...

102
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:09,940
Oh...

103
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,740
No, not thank God.

104
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,720
Okay, never mind.

105
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,840
Never mind!

106
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,720
Not thank God!

107
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,180
Okay, we're back on that screen.

108
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,900
We're back on it.

109
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:20,300
Okay.

110
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:21,780
Um...

111
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,680
Wait, why is it not...

112
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,340
At least...

113
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,680
Let me show you the screen.

114
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,860
Alright, so...

115
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,240
It might take a while...

116
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,140
For us to get in.

117
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,720
Because, like I said...

118
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,080
Um...

119
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,840
Uh...

120
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,080
Like I said...

121
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,720
Um...

122
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:33,920
Um...

123
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,040
I was on it...

124
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,120
At exactly 10am.

125
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,820
And now it's not...

126
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,220
You know...

127
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,060
Now...

128
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,100
Now I might not be in it.

129
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,000
Now I might not be in the queue anymore.

130
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,120
So...

131
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,420
That's the problem.

132
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,940
I'm not...

133
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,220
Because they have a queue system...

134
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,540
For everything.

135
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:55,760
Um...

136
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,820
They have a queue system.

137
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,020
And I join the queue at exactly 10 in the morning.

138
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,140
Which is when they open the doors.

139
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,640
And...

140
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,140
Uh...

141
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:04,920
And...

142
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,860
I couldn't move my mouse...

143
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,920
When they put me in.

144
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,860
Because I have to accept the TOS.

145
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,640
And then when I accepted the TOS...

146
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,820
I tried to accept the TOS.

147
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,080
But it wouldn't let me move my mouse.

148
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:15,860
Which is...

149
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,360
Fucking weird.

150
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,280
I think I just can't tab out.

151
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,500
I think this game doesn't let me tab out.

152
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,600
Which is crazy.

153
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,620
Because I...

154
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,380
Oh my god.

155
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:25,820
Okay.

156
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:26,360
This...

157
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:26,860
Wait!

158
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:27,420
Wait!

159
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,160
I'm in!

160
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,060
Wait!

161
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,220
Am I in?

162
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,600
Oh my god.

163
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:32,660
Okay.

164
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,660
I'm in.

165
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,640
I might have to force quit my game again.

166
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,320
HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!

167
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,100
Okay.

168
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:40,600
Every...

169
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,020
Okay.

170
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,020
I'm gonna say it.

171
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:42,800
But like...

172
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,680
It's very awkward.

173
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,580
Because you know.

174
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,520
We went through the nice relaxing...

175
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,080
Like the last time we were in the early access game.

176
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,860
It was nice and relaxing.

177
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,720
Um...

178
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,980
Because like...

179
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,240
Wait.

180
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,600
Why is it just a black screen?

181
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,160
I...

182
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,960
Because it was Marble Rivals.

183
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:04,380
And the launch for Marble Rivals was incredibly smooth.

184
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,840
So I'm not used to... Oh, man.

185
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,840
Here we go.

186
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:15,880
Alright.

187
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,540
Yay, we're in!

188
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,820
This is a rollercoaster of emotions right there.

189
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,400
I feel like I'm so back and then I'm not back.

190
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:36,080
I thought this was just for streamers only, but I forgot they gave access to, like, some other...

191
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,240
Some, like, they gave access to, like, non-creators, too.

192
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,020
Because, like, there was, like, a lottery system for it.

193
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,460
So I was like, how is there a population cap when it's just creators?

194
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,020
But I forgot.

195
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,440
There are non-creators in this server.

196
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:58,400
I have no idea what this game is about other than the fact that it's an extraction shooter and people were mad.

197
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,520
They were, like...

198
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,300
Like, when it was first announced, people were excited.

199
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:10,380
And then, like, I think, like, a couple of weeks ago, they were, like, Oh, it's an extraction shooter and then people got mad.

200
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,300
And then when I... I didn't realize that people were already hating this game.

201
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:18,440
When I tweeted... When I tweeted at Waiter Room, I saw so many people putting, like...

202
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,000
Um, you're gonna need a drink about this.

203
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,680
I can't believe you're playing this trash.

204
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,720
I was like, whoa.

205
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,420
I didn't realize people hate this game already.

206
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,800
I literally just got a free alpha code.

207
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,140
Like, hey, guys.

208
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,040
Hey, look.

209
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,780
I'm just checking out a new game.

210
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,680
Look, Shroud's playing it, okay?

211
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,440
Like, all the big streamers are playing this game right now.

212
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,100
Don't play me, guys.

213
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,540
All... All the...

214
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:48,840
Every big streamer who's anybody is currently playing this game.

215
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,200
Like, every FPS streamer right now.

216
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,400
Even Lyric is on it.

217
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,240
I'm just surprised Lyric is playing this game.

218
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,240
Um...

219
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,740
People were so mad.

220
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,440
I was just like, I could...

221
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,580
I am just trying...

222
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,980
I'm just checking out a new game, guys.

223
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,500
I'm just checking it out.

224
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:22,780
I didn't know this game was already so hated.

225
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,880
Ha ha ha ha ha.

226
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,260
Um...

227
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,680
Skellum, thank you for the super chat.

228
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,840
Thank you, thank you.

229
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:33,740
Um...

230
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,560
Okay, so these are all the characters.

231
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,660
Oh, wait.

232
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,520
You guys can't...

233
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:44,680
Oh, wait.

234
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,000
Sorry.

235
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:45,620
It's...

236
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,100
I forgot my screen share is pretty fucky right now.

237
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:48,760
Uh...

238
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,320
Let me fix the screen share.

239
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,760
Because I have to use, like...

240
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,860
I have to use...

241
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,000
Um...

242
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,500
Let me fix the screen share real quick.

243
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,600
Because the reason why it's, like, super fuck...

244
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,320
I just realized it was super zoomed in.

245
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,580
So if it looked really weird there...

246
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,780
It's because it was super zoomed in.

247
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,400
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

248
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,440
Uh...

249
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,360
Because I have to use...

250
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,560
I can't use game capture.

251
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,560
I have to use, like, window capture.

252
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,660
Which is, um...

253
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,780
Not a capture I prefer to use.

254
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:16,500
Um...

255
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,520
It's not like it's desktop capture.

256
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,540
It's just a different...

257
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:19,940
It's just...

258
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,340
I think this game used to be run by admin for game capture.

259
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:24,700
Um...

260
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,040
Anyway, so...

261
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,940
Locust War...

262
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,720
Oh, is it because...

263
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,640
This is, like, a remaster, right?

264
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,440
Or, like, a remake of the original Marathon game.

265
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,000
Or a sequel.

266
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:33,480
I don't know.

267
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,180
Apparently...

268
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,060
The original game was Marathon.

269
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,240
And I guess that's why people were mad.

270
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,920
Because the original Marathon game was, um...

271
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,760
The original Marathon game, um...

272
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,760
Was non-extraction shooter.

273
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,340
So...

274
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,980
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha...

275
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,680
Uh...

276
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,720
It's a reimagining.

277
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,420
Okay, yeah.

278
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,600
So I guess that's why people got mad.

279
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,160
Because I assume the original Marathon was non-extraction.

280
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,820
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha...

281
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,400
Ha ha ha ha ha ha...

282
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,280
Um...

283
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,100
Yeah, alright.

284
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:06,660
Locust.

285
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,160
War is brutal.

286
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:07,640
Be brutal.

287
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,380
Brothers are nature.

288
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:08,920
Okay.

289
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,020
Combat break the rhythm.

290
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:11,940
Camp...

291
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,140
Combat anarchist.

292
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,320
Combat specialist.

293
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:15,680
Uh...

294
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,940
Tactical strategist.

295
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,400
Run.

296
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,460
See the pattern.

297
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:18,880
Run.

298
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:19,980
Become the pattern.

299
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:20,420
Run.

300
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:20,960
Die.

301
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,500
Repeat.

302
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,520
Run.

303
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,700
Deliver the signal.

304
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:24,800
Oh my god.

305
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,720
I'm already lagging.

306
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,000
Okay.

307
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,140
I need to fix my...

308
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,060
I'm like in the character select.

309
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,020
I don't...

310
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:30,840
Ha ha ha ha ha.

311
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,720
I don't know.

312
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,260
Where's the options?

313
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:33,680
Okay.

314
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:34,780
Uh...

315
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,100
Settings.

316
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:35,560
All right.

317
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:35,900
Let's...

318
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,520
Let's fix the settings real quick.

319
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,040
Um...

320
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,300
All right.

321
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,840
Let's turn down the cents.

322
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:45,620
I'll put it at 13 for now, and I'll figure this out later.

323
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:51,980
This is bad because there's no aim converter right now for Marathon, and I don't know the calculations to do this.

324
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,680
Hold Quick Melee.

325
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,000
Let's fix all my settings now.

326
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,580
Toggle Zoom.

327
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,820
We don't use toggle.

328
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,840
We use Hold Sprint.

329
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,500
Toggle Sprint.

330
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,900
I'd rather use Hold Sprint.

331
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,500
Uh... Oops.

332
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,340
Alright.

333
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,260
Uh...

334
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,100
Let's see...

335
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:18,980
Uh...

336
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,760
I wanna get rid of... How do I...

337
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,560
How do I get rid of this?

338
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,980
I don't want this.

339
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:25,760
Oh, fuck.

340
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:26,780
Okay, that's not good.

341
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,700
Wait, I can't have that.

342
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,900
How do I...

343
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:31,880
What?

344
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,840
How do I... I'm just gonna put this on caps lock.

345
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:36,280
Who cares?

346
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,140
Okay, toggle crouch.

347
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,560
How do I...

348
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,620
Get rid of it?

349
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,320
Like, hello?

350
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,140
How do I...

351
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,720
How do I...

352
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:47,920
How do I...

353
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,820
Get rid of it?

354
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,720
Alright, I guess we don't get rid of it.

355
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,480
I don't know how to get rid of things.

356
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,880
It won't let me...

357
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,780
It won't let me get rid of it, too.

358
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,520
Oh, that's awkward.

359
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,400
You don't.

360
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,400
No, if I right-click, it goes to... Wait, can I right-click it?

361
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,240
Okay, let's see.

362
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:14,680
Like, it doesn't explain to me how to get rid of it, so I'm, like, confused.

363
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,960
Nope, it doesn't get rid of it.

364
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,240
Alright, that's awkward.

365
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,320
Yeah, let's cap that.

366
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:27,580
Um, we'll do 244, since that's where my monitor's at.

367
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,920
244, anti-alias.

368
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,200
Uh, okay.

369
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,000
I need to put this down.

370
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,060
I do not need to play at the highs.

371
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:44,320
We... Wait, since it's an extraction shooter... Uh, let's just put it on high for now.

372
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,580
And, like, let's stress test this.

373
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,040
We'll put it on high and stress test all of this.

374
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,640
Put this off.

375
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,060
I feel like if it's a shooter, just have motion blur off automatically.

376
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,220
I don't know why people would put that.

377
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:03,200
I feel like if you're from the shooter, you play FPS games, and you're an FPS dev, you just put motion blur on default in general.

378
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:09,200
Um, I think that you should know that it should be, um...

379
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:15,340
It should be, like, off the auto... like, on default, just because people normally don't play with it on.

380
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,220
Uh, subtitles are always on.

381
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,660
Why is it extra small?

382
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,060
I'm fucking blind as hell.

383
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:20,920
I...

384
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,320
That does not make sense.

385
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,620
Why you would have...

386
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,280
Why the fuck was that on extra small?

387
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:28,080
Alright.

388
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:29,880
Alright.

389
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:30,920
Gameplay.

390
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,220
Let me double check.

391
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:32,740
Okay.

392
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,340
Socials.

393
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,200
Crew invites.

394
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,300
Voice chat.

395
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,920
Push to talk.

396
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,540
Please put it on.

397
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,880
Uh, I do not want to...

398
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,220
Why the fuck was push to talk on off default?

399
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,360
Oh, my God!

400
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,880
I would have been...

401
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,640
If I queued up, I would have been open mic.

402
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,480
That would have been embarrassing.

403
00:17:59,440 --> 00:17:59,780
Um.

404
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,340
Um.

405
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,300
Alright, let's...

406
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,560
Where's the push to talk button?

407
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,160
Where is it?

408
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,020
Did you know push to talk button?

409
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:08,980
What the fuck?

410
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,660
Where is it?

411
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:10,600
Move...

412
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,300
Oh, there it is.

413
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,200
Push to talk.

414
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,220
Okay, here we go.

415
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:15,660
Um...

416
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:15,880
Alright.

417
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:16,960
Let's see.

418
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,000
Uh...

419
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,360
They don't have proximity chat.

420
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,620
Well, I still have to talk to people in my own team.

421
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:24,860
Like...

422
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,080
People in my...

423
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,760
I...

424
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,400
People in my own team would have heard me talk.

425
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,580
Because you have to be in, like, a squad of three.

426
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,100
Always?

427
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:32,800
Or something?

428
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,200
Uh...

429
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:34,580
Oh, wait.

430
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,800
No, it's a solo game.

431
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,160
Oh, wait.

432
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:36,720
Never mind.

433
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,760
I thought...

434
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,560
Okay, so for those who don't know.

435
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,380
When you get...

436
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,680
If you get a creator code.

437
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,040
They give you...

438
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,080
Two friend codes as well.

439
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,380
I assume the squad up.

440
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,500
But, like...

441
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,520
It's solo only.

442
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,540
Oh, maybe...

443
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,220
Oh, it's training!

444
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,800
Oh, that's why.

445
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,180
Okay.

446
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,540
It's a game mode.

447
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,220
So, yeah.

448
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,160
I was gonna say...

449
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:56,580
Like...

450
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,600
I was gonna say...

451
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,960
That's awkward if...

452
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,480
Oh, my God.

453
00:18:59,500 --> 00:18:59,900
There you go.

454
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,040
There's my extraction shooter.

455
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,140
Uh...

456
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,540
There it is.

457
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:04,600
Um...

458
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:04,680
Um...

459
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,560
So, a lot of streamers are going in with three already.

460
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,000
Um...

461
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,460
And so...

462
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:10,780
Uh...

463
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,800
That's why, like...

464
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,320
I was, like, thinking, like...

465
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:13,560
Okay.

466
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,120
You have to play with three people in general.

467
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,680
Even if it's randoms.

468
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,440
Um...

469
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,220
Okay.

470
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,860
How the fuck do I start this?

471
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:23,820
Okay.

472
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:24,680
Run.

473
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,380
I think it's alpha axis, guys.

474
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,380
If you guys...

475
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:29,580
Okay.

476
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,920
I won't judge the UI.

477
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,780
Because it is in alpha...

478
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,420
Axis.

479
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,160
It's not even in beta axis.

480
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,800
So, um...

481
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,400
I'm not surprised that...

482
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,420
The UI might look a little bit fucking wonky.

483
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,300
It looks like it's not finished.

484
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,320
Because I assume that...

485
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,620
Because it is in alpha.

486
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,240
But if it doesn't change in beta...

487
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,140
Then I'm like...

488
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,240
Oh, this is how it's gonna be.

489
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:56,640
Uh...

490
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,160
If...

491
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,160
If it doesn't change in the beta...

492
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,060
Then I'll be like...

493
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:02,300
Okay.

494
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:02,740
That's...

495
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,200
That's how it's gonna look like, I guess.

496
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:08,960
Alright.

497
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,560
I'm just not used to like...

498
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:13,880
I don't know.

499
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,980
I'm gonna say the launch was not as smooth as it...

500
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,500
Even getting like...

501
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,760
Alpha axis was like...

502
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,260
Really frustrating.

503
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,000
It was like...

504
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,400
Very frustrating in general.

505
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,140
Alright.

506
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:24,860
Um...

507
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,020
I hope this is all alpha.

508
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,980
Also, sound guy.

509
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,560
Let me know if everything's okay.

510
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,360
Okay.

511
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,520
That's me.

512
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,940
I hope outside is axis.

513
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,100
I hope outside is alpha axis.

514
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,440
Because that looks like shit.

515
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,420
Not gonna lie.

516
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,100
Alright.

517
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,160
Oh, shit.

518
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,160
I have a shield.

519
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,060
Okay.

520
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,040
Select your patch kit...

521
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,800
And use it to repair your shell.

522
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,160
Oh, am I...

523
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,040
Not okay?

524
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,080
I'm not okay.

525
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:06,800
Get me on.

526
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:08,940
Yeah.

527
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:09,760
Alright.

528
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:10,280
Nice.

529
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,760
Use it to regenerate damaged shields.

530
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,020
Alright.

531
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,500
I'm plugging it in.

532
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,520
Plugged.

533
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,420
I'm allowed outside now.

534
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,260
This has been disrupted.

535
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,740
Search the containers in the next room for armaments, ammunition.

536
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,240
Alright.

537
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,800
Here's the extraction part.

538
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,440
Why do I...

539
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,420
Put it over faster?

540
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,540
Put it over faster.

541
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:38,860
There you go.

542
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,380
Alright.

543
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,740
Get me some...

544
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,300
Substation key.

545
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,240
Controls...

546
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:46,800
The fuck?

547
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,880
Controls doorway within...

548
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,220
The subsection.

549
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,400
But how do I...

550
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,940
How do I get equipment faster?

551
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,680
Like, that's the struggle for me right now.

552
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,040
Oh, man.

553
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,500
I hope this is just alpha.

554
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,160
All I'm saying is that...

555
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,220
This doesn't look...

556
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,720
I'm on high...

557
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,660
I'm on high...

558
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,100
Highest graphics just to see what it looks like.

559
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,300
Yeah, it looks a little Robloxy.

560
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,080
Not gonna lie.

561
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,180
I will admit...

562
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,820
This does look a little Robloxy.

563
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,100
I will admit...

564
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:22,360
Alright.

565
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,520
This is just a tutorial.

566
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,740
Maybe it's just a tutorial area.

567
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,260
Oops.

568
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,220
How much bullets do I have?

569
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,420
Okay.

570
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,320
Enough.

571
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,360
I have a lot of bullets.

572
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,080
Alright.

573
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,000
Let's see.

574
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,260
Like...

575
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,780
Why is it like that?

576
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,660
I wanna...

577
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,520
Is there a way...

578
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,880
Easier way to...

579
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,600
Let's see.

580
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,440
I'm trying to see if there's like fast way...

581
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:46,660
No.

582
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:47,700
What?

583
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,680
There isn't?

584
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,620
Do I just...

585
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,680
Is there an easier way to fucking grab my items?

586
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,240
Like...

587
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,820
That's all I wanna know.

588
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,980
Is there an easier way?

589
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:01,560
Okay.

590
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,320
What is that?

591
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,360
Oh, it's over here.

592
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:06,860
Alright.

593
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,400
I got it.

594
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,880
Oh, I'm outside now.

595
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,460
I thought I would never have to go outside.

596
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,160
Oh, just left click it?

597
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:16,460
Okay.

598
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:18,460
Alright.

599
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,460
Let's go.

600
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,200
Where?

601
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,340
Engage or evade the enemy as you move towards your exit.

602
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:25,940
Where is it?

603
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,680
Thankfully, your shell is equipped with powerful abilities.

604
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:32,000
Deploy them to give yourself an edge in a firefight.

605
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:32,960
Oh, right here.

606
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,500
That's fine.

607
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,220
I don't want to hold my shield anyway.

608
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,960
How do I...

609
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,120
I'm trying to...

610
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:43,520
Oh, there you go.

611
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:43,860
It's two.

612
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:44,360
Okay.

613
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,220
Wait.

614
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,020
I hear an enemy.

615
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:52,920
Reach the exfilt point and activate the device to escape the planet with everything you can.

616
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,160
Alright.

617
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,320
Okay, nice.

618
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,720
Exfiltration within the time unit will result in the loss of everything you can.

619
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,620
Oh, there's...

620
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,900
And the death of your shell.

621
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,900
There's recoil.

622
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,820
Jesus Christ.

623
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,440
There is actual recoil you have to control.

624
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:07,860
What?

625
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,400
How did I do that?

626
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,020
Oh, it's just jump.

627
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:11,600
Double jump.

628
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:11,920
Okay.

629
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,180
I'm, like, trying to figure out this control...

630
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:18,220
The thing I'm not really too happy about is the stamina.

631
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:20,820
Okay.

632
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,960
You just have to, like, left-click it.

633
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,380
You've reached the exfilt point.

634
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:31,600
Activate it to initiate the matter transfer and transport yourself and your possessions to safety.

635
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,100
Alright.

636
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:35,380
Once the transfer begins, stay within the active area.

637
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,340
There is movement, yeah.

638
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,600
There is recoil.

639
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,640
I'll show you guys the recoil here.

640
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,600
That's me not holding...

641
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,840
Like, that's me just not controlling...

642
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:46,820
Um...

643
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,360
Yeah, there...

644
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,860
That's me not controlling it.

645
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,800
That's the recoil.

646
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:57,840
I mean...

647
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,040
I think, like, my only issue is that it does look Roblox-y outside.

648
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,820
Which, like...

649
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:06,380
It could be just the style, but...

650
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,100
Um...

651
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,400
I'm not really into that type of style for my, uh...

652
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:10,960
Gun gameplay.

653
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,600
Stamina is, like...

654
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,440
I'm not used to, like...

655
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,260
Stam...

656
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:35,040
I have a good stamina control.

657
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,000
Because I'm not used to controlling my stamina management.

658
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:38,400
Yeah.

659
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:42,620
Alright.

660
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,780
Return to lobby.

661
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,060
Alright.

662
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:44,880
That was my tutorial.

663
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,020
That was a very fast tutorial.

664
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,020
I...

665
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,120
They teach me more.

666
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:54,120
But I guess now I go in and I hope I don't get yelled at by other creators.

667
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:54,840
Alright.

668
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:57,980
That's it.

669
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:58,840
Alright.

670
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,460
What's this?

671
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,000
Oh, it's shader issue.

672
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,240
Shader code is not finished.

673
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:11,640
Okay.

674
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,120
What's this?

675
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,220
Okay.

676
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,620
This is lore?

677
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,700
Is YouTube lagging like crazy?

678
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,840
Let me check.

679
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,700
Oh, it does say...

680
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,180
Oh, nope.

681
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,320
Seems fine.

682
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,320
I actually don't know.

683
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,860
Oh, it's good?

684
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,200
Okay.

685
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,860
It could be YouTube then.

686
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,900
Then, if some people aren't lagging.

687
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,760
Oh, if some people are stuttering a little.

688
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,720
It could be YouTube.

689
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,640
I actually don't know.

690
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,680
It could be YouTube then.

691
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,520
Then, if some people aren't experiencing it.

692
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,180
Alright.

693
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,040
So, I guess she's the lore giver.

694
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,040
Is that it?

695
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,760
Did she give me the lore?

696
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,680
Oh, there we go.

697
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,140
Oh, okay.

698
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:30,820
She's giving...

699
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,480
Oh, she's like the quest giver.

700
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,040
I see.

701
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,780
I am not a fan of the UI.

702
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,880
I'm so overwhelmed.

703
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:36,600
I...

704
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,740
I'm actually...

705
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,760
I'm a little overwhelmed with...

706
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,440
Okay.

707
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,960
With this UI.

708
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:47,680
I...

709
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,940
I'm gonna assume it's just alpha.

710
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,920
But I'm not...

711
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,500
I am very overwhelmed looking at this UI.

712
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,880
Digital contracts can be found.

713
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,040
Purely populates with new standards.

714
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,760
If you select it, it does not fit your place out.

715
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,320
You can re-roll it.

716
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,140
Standard contracts are simple.

717
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:12,080
Repeal tasks are more focused and offered increased rewards.

718
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,300
Jesus Christ, this font.

719
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,340
Oh, fuck.

720
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,180
Did I...

721
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,520
Activate it, I guess.

722
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,480
I...

723
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,180
Oh, shit.

724
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,280
Like...

725
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:25,720
I'm...

726
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,940
I am...

727
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,480
I am so...

728
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,280
Out of...

729
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,200
I'm so overwhelmed right now.

730
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,240
I'm not okay.

731
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,720
Okay.

732
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,180
I clicked the thing.

733
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:38,720
Alright.

734
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:39,440
Okay.

735
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,460
Get me out, I guess.

736
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,200
I activated it.

737
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,120
Welcome to the Marathon's closed alpha.

738
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:46,580
Okay.

739
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:47,800
That's cool.

740
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,120
Uh...

741
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,200
There's perimeter and there's...

742
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,520
I guess we'll try perimeter because I...

743
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,200
This is the...

744
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,400
The first one.

745
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,420
Fuck.

746
00:28:59,600 --> 00:28:59,800
Okay.

747
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,240
Let's see.

748
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,380
What are the other abilities?

749
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,780
Search and destroy.

750
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:03,920
Barricade.

751
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,580
What the fuck is disruptor?

752
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,840
Transform your aim into a cannon?

753
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:08,380
Wait.

754
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,000
That sounds so fucking cool.

755
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,160
Oh, wait.

756
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,380
There's different...

757
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,980
To fire boosters to...

758
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:14,340
Oh!

759
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,740
When I did the double jump, it's different.

760
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:22,140
Double press sprint to move faster at a cost of generating increasing heat.

761
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,680
Activate your shoulder mounted missile pods.

762
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,800
Oh, I didn't even realize I have a missile pod.

763
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:28,880
Uh...

764
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,080
Reducing increases movement speed and weapon dexterity.

765
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,160
Activate...

766
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,020
Inand to perform another jump.

767
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,040
Grants a supercharged slide.

768
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:38,540
Okay.

769
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,180
That's like...

770
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,920
The heat I assume is stamina.

771
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:46,800
Also, I'm lagging because for some reason, during character select, I lag.

772
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,000
Like, I...

773
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,140
I don't understand.

774
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,180
It's only...

775
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:53,820
I feel like it's only in the character select that this happens, too.

776
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:54,680
Okay.

777
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:55,960
To gently...

778
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,660
Alright, what's this?

779
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:02,860
Activate your shell through releasing series of sonar pulses that reveals the location.

780
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,260
Deploy a micro bot that tracks down nearby hostiles.

781
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,220
Ooh, I like that.

782
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:09,680
Um...

783
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,960
Yawmish, they're ruining in your shell's HUD.

784
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:15,520
Performing a finisher on a runner pings their crew.

785
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:16,580
Uh...

786
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,520
They leave behind a lingerie.

787
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,920
Okay, so this is the support.

788
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,720
Blackbird is...

789
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,440
Alright, we're never using any smoke characters because that would just be...

790
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,080
I'll try it.

791
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:25,740
Blackbird.

792
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,060
That should be...

793
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:27,820
Let's go.

794
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,100
Alright.

795
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,080
Let's see who...

796
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,760
Crew fill enable if empty.

797
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,260
Oh, nice.

798
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,220
Let's grab...

799
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,240
Grab people in and hope we don't get...

800
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:37,780
Yelled at.

801
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,240
Let's...

802
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:40,880
Let's...

803
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,240
Let's just hope we don't get yelled at, guys.

804
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:50,480
So I did get two free friend codes for...

805
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,040
Like...

806
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,320
For being created.

807
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,000
And...

808
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,140
You can see that I'm playing alone.

809
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,100
So I didn't bring anyone with me.

810
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:03,960
Um...

811
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,560
No, there is.

812
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:05,120
There is.

813
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,200
There's just no...

814
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:06,860
Proximity.

815
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,180
I...

816
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,560
Apparently, there's just no proximity VC.

817
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,500
But there is regular VC.

818
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,140
Um...

819
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,420
There is, like, team VC.

820
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,580
I'm pretty sure there's team voice chat.

821
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,860
It's just that you can't talk to, like, uh...

822
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,380
Enemies.

823
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,420
Um...

824
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:27,790
But yeah, I'm a little worried that...

825
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:31,540
I mean, I could do no fill, but we'll see what...

826
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:36,120
If, like, the experience with playing with randoms is not the best, I'll just play with...

827
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:43,060
I'll just play with, like, no fill and just get absolute shit on because I think all the other bigger creators brought friends.

828
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:57,850
But I'm pretty sure there's just, like, you guys just can't talk to, like, the enemies, but you can talk to your own team because I had the option to.

829
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:01,990
I had the, like, settings to talk to, like, my own teammates.

830
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:07,590
So, unless they, like, turn it off during alpha, which would be fucking weird to do.

831
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:11,270
So, I hope they didn't, like, I'll still get water.

832
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,330
I'll be right back, guys.

833
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:14,490
Oh, shit.

834
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:15,850
No, my headphones!

835
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:17,950
Sorry, I dropped accidentally.

836
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:21,850
My foot got caught on the wire of my headphones, so I fell.

837
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:37,980
Alright.

838
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,120
So, my headphones are okay.

839
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,480
So, I didn't hook that up.

840
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,900
Wow, that standby is taking a while.

841
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,440
I'll assume it's because we need...

842
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,100
I didn't start right away, so...

843
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,460
I only assume I didn't start right away.

844
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,460
So, now they're, like, waiting for it to fill up the lobby.

845
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,840
That's my bad.

846
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:08,640
I should have maybe stopped, started the game right away.

847
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,680
I just assumed that...

848
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,060
I don't know.

849
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,320
I just thought I would find a lot.

850
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,420
I thought, like, since an extraction shooter, I get in, like...

851
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:19,900
Um...

852
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,500
I'd get in, like...

853
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,300
Faster?

854
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,720
But I guess that's when you find...

855
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,940
Oh, maybe no one else needed a team.

856
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:27,980
Oh, you're right.

857
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,660
Wait, can I cancel?

858
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,800
Oh, you're right.

859
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,220
Am I, like, the one only solo?

860
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,900
Manny and Johnny, thank you for the super chat.

861
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,060
Thank you, thank you.

862
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,500
Oh, I should have said it solo.

863
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,700
But I can't get out.

864
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,080
Oh, this is bad.

865
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:46,560
I...

866
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,540
I'm stuck here.

867
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,620
Trying to find other...

868
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:49,940
Players.

869
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:50,480
Please.

870
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,780
Any others...

871
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,560
Did all the other creators have friends?

872
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,580
There's no way.

873
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,380
There's no fucking way.

874
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,060
How did the other creators have friends already?

875
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,100
I...

876
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:06,620
Please.

877
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:07,420
I...

878
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,400
That's not fair.

879
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,860
I should have...

880
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,680
Why did I not bring anyone here?

881
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,200
No, that's so funny.

882
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:16,920
Please.

883
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:17,820
All right, guys.

884
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,840
If we don't get a game in...

885
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,380
Um...

886
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:25,800
If we don't get a game within, like...

887
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,340
Uh...

888
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,100
Five minutes...

889
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,420
Oh, wait.

890
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,980
We might have to reboot the game so I can...

891
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,540
Play...

892
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,100
I have to do solo queue.

893
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,180
No!

894
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,020
I don't understand.

895
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,900
I thought there'd be people who are friendless too!

896
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,060
What do you mean?

897
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,760
There's randoms in here?

898
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:52,280
There's non-creators in this lobby?

899
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,380
All right.

900
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,720
That's not fair.

901
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,060
I can't believe it.

902
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,540
I can't believe other creators have friends.

903
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:00,500
I...

904
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,300
It's not fair.

905
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,860
How was I supposed to know?

906
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,000
I thought...

907
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,460
I'd get in...

908
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,160
Right away.

909
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,280
I can't believe I'm forced to, like...

910
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,900
Actually solo queue.

911
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,020
I can't believe it.

912
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,660
Oh my god.

913
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,740
I just want to know what it's like.

914
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,200
How dare they.

915
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,300
Do people still solo queue?

916
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:34,840
Apparently not.

917
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,500
Apparently I am, like...

918
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,960
The world's only solo queueer in this marathon alpha.

919
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,040
Oh, I'm in!

920
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,960
Your gear is at risk.

921
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,460
You will lose all equipped gear if you exit or disconnect from the game.

922
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,180
Guys, thank god I didn't disconnect.

923
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,180
I hope I don't get yelled at.

924
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,300
Okay.

925
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,380
Now what?

926
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:57,840
Oh.

927
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,780
I have no idea who these people are.

928
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,740
But here I am.

929
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:04,820
Oh my god.

930
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,220
I am not the world's only solo queueer.

931
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,700
But I am la...

932
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,380
Wait, am I...

933
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,180
Let's see.

934
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:12,540
Um...

935
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,460
Oh no.

936
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,220
I'm not lagging.

937
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,660
It was just when we were paused.

938
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:17,760
Alright.

939
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,840
Hello, everybody.

940
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,860
I'm not gonna talk to them.

941
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,480
Do I have an actual gun?

942
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,000
I do.

943
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:24,420
Okay.

944
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,720
Is there fall damage?

945
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:26,980
Oh, no fall damage.

946
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:27,940
That's the best part.

947
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:29,860
Alright.

948
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,100
Let's see.

949
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,680
Will I get shot at?

950
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,480
If I, like, go in by myself?

951
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,380
Let's find out.

952
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,100
Okay.

953
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,640
I love extraction shooters.

954
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,620
I hope it lives longer than two months.

955
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:50,660
Alright.

956
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:51,940
Well...

957
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,440
Um...

958
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:53,940
Cool.

959
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,060
Well, I guess I'll get the scraps.

960
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,060
That's cool.

961
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,560
Wait, what?

962
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,440
Oh, there's, like, stuff over here.

963
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,600
We're solo queuing.

964
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,240
We are not...

965
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,740
We're definitely not playing as if...

966
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:14,280
I don't know.

967
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,280
Okay, there is health.

968
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,480
And shield charge.

969
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,400
We might need that.

970
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:18,600
Definitely.

971
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:19,620
Okay, nice.

972
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,760
I can just break windows.

973
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,100
Oh, wait.

974
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:23,980
Somebody...

975
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,260
Someone's injured.

976
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,700
Oh, people are fighting already.

977
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,680
Where are they?

978
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:36,610
Okay.

979
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,930
Oh, that's just AI.

980
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:41,350
There we go.

981
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,270
It's just AI.

982
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:43,410
Nothing to worry about.

983
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:45,410
All right.

984
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:47,230
Whoops.

985
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:48,470
Go.

986
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,880
I don't know what that...

987
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,780
I forgot what it does.

988
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,400
But go.

989
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,620
Go do your thing.

990
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,160
Go!

991
00:37:59,460 --> 00:37:59,880
Travel!

992
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,000
Find somebody!

993
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,640
I don't think you found anyone.

994
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:07,640
What's this?

995
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,100
Wait, what the fuck?

996
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,120
What am I getting shot at?

997
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,160
Let me, like, get recharge.

998
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,440
Shield recharge.

999
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,860
Wait, what?

1000
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:22,880
How are you down?

1001
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:28,140
I don't know this map to, like, fucking save you.

1002
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,400
Where are you?

1003
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,580
Who killed you?

1004
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,440
Oh, shit!

1005
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,140
Who the fuck killed you?

1006
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,240
You're fine.

1007
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,060
You're so healthy.

1008
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:49,810
Did you die to an AI?

1009
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:52,090
Bro.

1010
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:53,390
That's awkward.

1011
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:54,870
What?

1012
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,890
What the fuck does that mean?

1013
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:02,510
Boom, boom, boom.

1014
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:04,050
Boom, boom, boom.

1015
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,110
Oh.

1016
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:07,370
Wait, there's people near me.

1017
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:08,870
I hear them.

1018
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:12,430
I don't remember some of my abilities.

1019
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:13,730
I'm a little confused.

1020
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:17,030
I think he died to AI.

1021
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:21,370
Because, like, we would have been pushed instantly if it was a real person.

1022
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:23,530
And we weren't.

1023
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:26,610
So I'm pretty sure he just died to AI.

1024
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:28,170
Like, right now.

1025
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:30,350
Bro!

1026
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:33,550
Bro, I can tell you don't play shooters normally.

1027
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:48,510
Like, I can sort of tell that this guy does not normally play shooters.

1028
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:51,330
How he plays?

1029
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:51,670
Yeah.

1030
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,090
Oh, man.

1031
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:57,610
Let me...

1032
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:58,750
I can only use my pistol.

1033
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,010
I don't have a lot of ammo left.

1034
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:05,530
Okay.

1035
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:07,890
Bro, are you really gonna take my shit?

1036
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:09,950
I killed him for us.

1037
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:15,290
Yeah, I don't have much ammo now.

1038
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,490
I have to be careful.

1039
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:19,710
I literally wasted all my ammo for this one guy.

1040
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:33,410
God, where's the ammo here?

1041
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:36,170
I'm just taking shit just to take shit.

1042
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:43,510
Does anyone remember what my spacebar thing was?

1043
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:46,750
Wait, what?

1044
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:48,390
Reinforcements are incoming.

1045
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,730
I definitely need ammo, though.

1046
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:55,070
I need lock container key.

1047
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,520
Alright.

1048
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,720
Well, now we know that things are breakable.

1049
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,000
I can't shoot much.

1050
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,020
I don't have a lot of ammo.

1051
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,580
I hope that he's gonna help us.

1052
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,140
Alright.

1053
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,180
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

1054
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,560
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

1055
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,860
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

1056
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,620
Smoke grenade.

1057
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,500
Mechanics hit.

1058
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,860
What do I have here?

1059
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:29,000
I don't know.

1060
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,720
That affects.

1061
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:31,460
Immobilize.

1062
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,460
Retarges one shield.

1063
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,500
I'm, like, looking at the stuff I have.

1064
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,960
I just don't have ammo.

1065
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,660
That's, like, my biggest issue.

1066
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:44,250
I need ammo really badly.

1067
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:45,530
Lab equipment.

1068
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:49,930
I don't even know what to actually get rid of.

1069
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:55,410
Oh, man.

1070
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,470
I'm just...

1071
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:00,210
I guess I'll pistol.

1072
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:03,110
I guess I'm pistoning.

1073
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:05,410
I don't know.

1074
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:06,430
So, they're 547.

1075
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:08,870
Where the fuck?

1076
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:12,870
Yeah, like...

1077
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:15,490
Well, I assume that everybody else has already...

1078
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:17,410
Everyone has enough ammo.

1079
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:18,250
Fuck it.

1080
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:18,590
You know what?

1081
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:19,590
I'm gonna use my last recharge.

1082
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:20,710
I don't really care.

1083
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:22,890
Like, I just...

1084
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:24,910
I need to be full HP anyway.

1085
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:32,580
I don't know how I feel about this particular...

1086
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:34,100
Um...

1087
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:34,440
Character.

1088
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,240
Woo!

1089
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:36,940
I missed!

1090
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:39,640
It's okay.

1091
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,420
We all missed.

1092
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:42,360
And then there's, like, stat...

1093
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,800
Okay, let me see if I can actually...

1094
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,200
I'll grab this, I guess?

1095
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:50,450
We're still there.

1096
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:51,490
Where's our boy?

1097
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,420
I don't understand what...

1098
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,860
What that sound effect means.

1099
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:01,700
I...

1100
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,540
When he does, like...

1101
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:04,140
Bum, bum, bum.

1102
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:05,420
Bum, bum, bum.

1103
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:10,780
Oh, other people are gonna be here.

1104
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,900
Where's extraction shit?

1105
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,900
This is bad, because I don't have actual...

1106
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:16,920
Bullets.

1107
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,360
I have one...

1108
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,880
Wait, he's doing actual objective.

1109
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,400
What is that?

1110
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,000
What are you doing?

1111
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,300
Storage data.

1112
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,000
Oh my god, did I actually get...

1113
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,420
Oh my god, I need ammo.

1114
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,900
Please, for the love of god, give me ammo.

1115
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,640
What the fuck does this mean?

1116
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,600
Come on.

1117
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:40,940
I'm hacking?

1118
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:42,760
Oh!

1119
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,140
I failed my hack?

1120
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,080
I...

1121
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,080
Bum, bum, bum.

1122
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,240
Bum, bum, bum.

1123
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,580
Bum, bum, bum.

1124
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,380
I don't know what they're doing.

1125
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,080
I'm just...

1126
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,000
I'm following along the ride.

1127
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:01,980
What the fuck?

1128
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,160
All right.

1129
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:06,540
Do you have ammo?

1130
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,180
Guys, none of them have ammo.

1131
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,340
Me and my one bullet.

1132
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:11,920
Let's go!

1133
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:18,760
Well, I just have millet.

1134
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:19,320
Boom.

1135
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:21,280
Wow!

1136
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:23,600
Oh yeah, I can do that too.

1137
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,460
But I...

1138
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:24,740
No!

1139
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,260
I don't have...

1140
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:27,800
No, I don't have ammo!

1141
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:30,740
Oh no.

1142
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:32,660
Oh no.

1143
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:34,860
Oh, this is bad.

1144
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:35,280
Bro!

1145
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:36,880
Bro, don't be stupid!

1146
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,280
Don't be stupid!

1147
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,600
What are you doing?

1148
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:40,880
Oh my god!

1149
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:41,620
It worked?

1150
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,380
I have to just melee.

1151
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,120
That's all I have.

1152
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,260
Wait, where is he?

1153
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,380
Oh fuck!

1154
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:55,780
Okay.

1155
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:59,700
Oh my god.

1156
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:02,900
Oh no!

1157
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:03,850
I don't...

1158
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:04,720
I don't...

1159
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,820
No one can seek or deploy.

1160
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:09,280
Jesus Christ.

1161
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,040
All right, this is bad.

1162
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:14,460
I don't have ammo.

1163
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,980
I literally don't have ammo.

1164
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:16,840
This is so bad.

1165
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,820
I don't have ammo.

1166
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:27,440
This is so bad.

1167
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,480
I don't have ammo.

1168
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:29,420
This is so bad.

1169
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:30,380
I...

1170
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,000
Oh, please.

1171
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:39,380
There has to be something with ammo!

1172
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:41,600
Oh my god!

1173
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:43,660
I have nothing!

1174
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:45,580
Get me out!

1175
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,560
Let me out of here!

1176
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:54,300
Oh my god.

1177
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:57,680
I wanna leave, but my team doesn't wanna leave!

1178
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,220
Let me leave!

1179
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:00,280
Let me leave!

1180
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:04,760
Jesus Christ, I'm fucking...

1181
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,220
Oh my god.

1182
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:10,400
Guys, we should leave.

1183
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:14,640
Guys, why is my teammates still here?

1184
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:18,880
Why is my teammates still trying to do something here?

1185
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:21,220
Let me out of here!

1186
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,160
Let me out of here!

1187
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,700
I don't have another grenade!

1188
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:24,900
Wait!

1189
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,960
Guys, I nearly... This is cosmetic!

1190
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:31,800
My gun is actual cosmetic right now!

1191
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:33,560
Like, I have a knife!

1192
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:37,460
I guess I'll just use that!

1193
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:40,540
Oh my god, wait.

1194
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,880
Does this have ammo in it?

1195
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,720
Does this...

1196
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,220
Does this...

1197
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:46,400

1199
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:49,040

1200
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,380

1201
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,500
Guys, please!

1202
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:56,220
I don't wanna be here anymore!

1203
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:57,500
Fucking let's go!

1204
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:03,710
Oh my god.

1205
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:05,450
Guys, remember when I have, like, cosmetic?

1206
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:08,570
I have cosmetic guns!

1207
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:17,310
Okay.

1208
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:20,510
You see us?

1209
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:21,530
Okay, I'm looking.

1210
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:22,370
Let's leave.

1211
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:22,870
Let's go.

1212
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:24,130
Let's go.

1213
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:27,890
Guys, please, you do not need this loot.

1214
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:30,650
Please.

1215
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:33,050
What if I yoink?

1216
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:34,950
Let's just leave.

1217
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:36,070
I'm going.

1218
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:38,710
Alright.

1219
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:39,610
Let's see.

1220
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:40,710
I'm looking at the map.

1221
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:41,830
How do I...

1222
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:42,730
Intercept?

1223
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:46,810
Is this the interception thing?

1224
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:50,390
Okay.

1225
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:55,550
Is there an interception thing right here?

1226
00:47:58,010 --> 00:47:58,590
Whoa!

1227
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:00,890
Wait, I want that.

1228
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:04,370
Where do I put it on my thing?

1229
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:06,830
I'm taking that.

1230
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:09,430
That's 540 mule right there.

1231
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:11,970
Whoa!

1232
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:14,710
That's a lot of mule right there.

1233
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:15,690
Whoa!

1234
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:17,050
I'm fucking rich!

1235
00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:18,530
With zero bullets!

1236
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:23,690
Oh my god!

1237
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:25,950
Money, money, money.

1238
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:28,290
Must be funny.

1239
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:31,150
In a rich man's world.

1240
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:32,550
If we can leave.

1241
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:33,690
Alright.

1242
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:35,750
Ping.

1243
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:37,950
Okay, intercept.

1244
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:38,590
U.S.

1245
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:39,690
Where are y'all?

1246
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:40,590
The excru...

1247
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:43,110
Where the fuck is the...

1248
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:44,650
How do I get out?

1249
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:45,410
How?

1250
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:46,410
Guys!

1251
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:48,030
Is this the...

1252
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:49,210
Is this, right?

1253
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:50,910
What's the thing to get...

1254
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:52,190
Why are you looking at me like that?

1255
00:48:52,490 --> 00:48:52,950
Why?

1256
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:56,070
I'm trying to figure out the map!

1257
00:48:57,790 --> 00:48:58,470
Okay.

1258
00:48:58,850 --> 00:48:59,590
Is this, right?

1259
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:00,330
Guys.

1260
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:01,610
We should go.

1261
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:03,950
We should go.

1262
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:05,850
I wanna leave.

1263
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:08,830
I really wanna leave, guys.

1264
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:10,390
We should go.

1265
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:11,570
Alright.

1266
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:13,990
Where is it on my map?

1267
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:17,750
Self relay...

1268
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:19,290
Wait, does it not show up on my map?

1269
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:21,610
Let's see.

1270
00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:22,550
View more.

1271
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:23,830
I wanna go.

1272
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:27,290
Oh, wait.

1273
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:28,790
Let's go, crew.

1274
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:29,650
Let's go here.

1275
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:31,290
Alright.

1276
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:32,010
I'm going.

1277
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:32,810
Alright.

1278
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:33,530
There it is.

1279
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:34,390
Come on, guys.

1280
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:36,390
Can't be here forever.

1281
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:38,010
Come on!

1282
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:41,990
Let's go.

1283
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:44,630
Let's go, everyone.

1284
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:45,710
Hey, guys.

1285
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:46,450
Let's...

1286
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:47,790
Let's fucking go.

1287
00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:51,030
Like, we've been here in this one area for 20 years.

1288
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:52,930
I'm ready to move on.

1289
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:56,470
So ready to move on.

1290
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:00,430
I've had it with this team.

1291
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:01,650
Oh, shit.

1292
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:03,450
I don't have bullets to fight this.

1293
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:07,050
Alright.

1294
00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:11,370
Prepare for increased hostile action.

1295
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:13,230
What do you mean increased...

1296
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:14,890
Why is it so far?

1297
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:17,090
Holy fuck!

1298
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:18,110
It's like...

1299
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:19,750
An actual traveling.

1300
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:22,910
It's actually so fucking far.

1301
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:24,990
Oh my god.

1302
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:30,330
How do I ask for bullets?

1303
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:31,870
I don't even know.

1304
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:34,150
At least he's listening to me.

1305
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:35,170
Alright.

1306
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:36,690
Damn it.

1307
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:38,810
Is that guy okay?

1308
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:40,530
I don't know if he's okay.

1309
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:43,950
He'll be fine.

1310
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:48,570
Like, my mission right now is to actually, like...

1311
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:50,650
Grab some bullets somewhere.

1312
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:53,310
There's no way there's no bullets anywhere.

1313
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:56,150
Like, I refuse to believe that...

1314
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:58,930
Nobody is carrying any ammo.

1315
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:04,030
Oh my god.

1316
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:05,230
We have ten minutes.

1317
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:06,050
Guys, please.

1318
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:07,950
Okay.

1319
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:09,670
We're so close.

1320
00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:10,230
I...

1321
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:11,410
I need to know.

1322
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:12,730
There has to be a minimap.

1323
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:14,970
I can't be fucking pressing M the entire time.

1324
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:17,950
If I die...

1325
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:19,250
I deserve it.

1326
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:21,630
My team and I have been, like, stuck here for 20 years.

1327
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:22,370
Like...

1328
00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:25,470
If I die, it's, like, heavily deserved.

1329
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:28,390
All right.

1330
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:30,490
Oh, she's dead.

1331
00:51:33,610 --> 00:51:35,170
Do we leave her to die?

1332
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:41,270
Do we leave her?

1333
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:42,870
Um...

1334
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:44,230
You're too far gone, buddy.

1335
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:50,210
Sorry, man.

1336
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:50,970
You're too...

1337
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:51,590
You did not...

1338
00:51:51,590 --> 00:51:52,710
You should have followed us.

1339
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:54,970
You should have fucking followed us.

1340
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:55,910
That's all I'm gonna say.

1341
00:51:56,910 --> 00:52:00,450
I wanna go through this, cause it's, like, heavily guarded and everything.

1342
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:03,290
It's not my fault.

1343
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:05,390
Oh, man.

1344
00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:06,890
Is that, like...

1345
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:09,270
How we get through this?

1346
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:10,450
Holy shit.

1347
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:13,830
Sorry, buddy.

1348
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:15,790
You should have followed.

1349
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:18,990
Wait...

1350
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:20,550
There's people in here.

1351
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:25,650
There's people in here.

1352
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,520
Okay, we can't break that.

1353
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:37,000
I'm a little worried.

1354
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:40,600
Where's my teammate?

1355
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:41,020
Okay.

1356
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:42,120
He has an actual gun.

1357
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:45,940
I'm a little worried.

1358
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:50,300
All right.

1359
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:51,020
Bullets.

1360
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:52,220
Oh my god!

1361
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:53,490
I...

1362
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,080
Oh my god!

1363
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,520
I have real guns!

1364
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:00,960
Okay.

1365
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:04,180
Goodbye, Gigaflux.

1366
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:05,020
Goodbye.

1367
00:53:07,830 --> 00:53:08,340
Eliminated.

1368
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:09,180
Oh shit.

1369
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:12,300
Okay.

1370
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:15,100
Real gun, though.

1371
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:20,260
Real gun, though.

1372
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:21,640
Oh shit!

1373
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:25,910
Here we go.

1374
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:27,110
It's fine.

1375
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:28,930
No more real gun, though.

1376
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:32,690
All right.

1377
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:34,150
Oh my god.

1378
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:35,870
Swap, please.

1379
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:38,410
So I can shoot a real gun.

1380
00:53:41,470 --> 00:53:43,170
I take anything I can get.

1381
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:45,370
All right.

1382
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:46,030
Let's see.

1383
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:46,990
North Relay.

1384
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:47,330
All right.

1385
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:47,750
There we go.

1386
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:48,170
Let's go.

1387
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:52,190
All right.

1388
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:55,630
Bro, my teammate's 80 miles away.

1389
00:53:55,810 --> 00:53:56,950
She died so far.

1390
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:57,570
I...

1391
00:53:57,570 --> 00:53:58,550
There's no hope for her.

1392
00:53:58,950 --> 00:53:59,990
Like, we have to leave.

1393
00:54:00,310 --> 00:54:02,510
We have to fucking leave.

1394
00:54:02,890 --> 00:54:06,190
Like, I'm the only one that's willing to fucking leave.

1395
00:54:07,550 --> 00:54:10,370
If anything, I'm pretty sure...

1396
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:14,570
I'm pretty sure I'm gonna get absolutely, like, get my shit kicked in.

1397
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:18,410
By, like, whatever random team is also at the extraction point.

1398
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:19,350
Like...

1399
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:20,910
I feel like...

1400
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:22,670
I feel like there's some...

1401
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:23,410
Another team...

1402
00:54:23,410 --> 00:54:24,710
There's definitely another team there.

1403
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:25,490
There...

1404
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:26,690
Oh my god.

1405
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:29,350
There is definitely another team on that Relay right now.

1406
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:30,370
This is...

1407
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:33,850
I don't have ammo for a fight.

1408
00:54:34,090 --> 00:54:38,130
I will not be surprised if there is a team right there.

1409
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:41,010
There's no way it's safe.

1410
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:44,610
I'm just gonna use this just in case.

1411
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:47,210
I don't...

1412
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:47,950
Okay, nice.

1413
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,290
Alright, we're safe.

1414
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:50,030
We're safe.

1415
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:51,650
We can actually leave.

1416
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:55,210
We can actually leave.

1417
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:56,070
We're so safe.

1418
00:54:56,970 --> 00:54:57,470
There we go.

1419
00:54:58,150 --> 00:54:58,910
There we go.

1420
00:55:01,150 --> 00:55:01,670
Oh.

1421
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:06,670
Okay.

1422
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:09,930
I don't have real guns, so...

1423
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:13,030
Okay.

1424
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:14,530
Um...

1425
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:15,090
There we go.

1426
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:15,650
Go up.

1427
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:20,070
Alright.

1428
00:55:21,770 --> 00:55:22,790
I don't have ammo.

1429
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:23,970
I don't have ammo, I don't have ammo.

1430
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:25,270
So this is the best I can do.

1431
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:28,250
So I actually don't have ammo.

1432
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:29,110
I don't have ammo.

1433
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:31,430
I don't have ammo.

1434
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:33,810
Oh my god, please!

1435
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:47,370
No, how did you die?

1436
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,760
Are you fucking kidding me?

1437
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:55,660
No way.

1438
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:57,780
There's no way.

1439
00:55:58,100 --> 00:55:59,180
There's no way!

1440
00:55:59,360 --> 00:55:59,980
I'm sorry!

1441
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,140
I'm sorry, man!

1442
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:03,220
I'm so sorry.

1443
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,340
Oh my god!

1444
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:07,840
It's so close!

1445
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:10,620
Did I get it through?

1446
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:15,120
I'm sorry!

1447
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,200
I'm sorry, man!

1448
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:18,620
I'm sorry!

1449
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,140
I had to just crawl!

1450
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,420
I just crawl!

1451
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:26,960
You can make it!

1452
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:30,300
You can make it, buddy!

1453
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:31,980
Just keep crawling!

1454
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:39,960
Buddy, I had to get out!

1455
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,400
I had to go away!

1456
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:47,020
I won!

1457
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:49,360
I did it!

1458
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:58,520
I can't believe that!

1459
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:01,500
No!

1460
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:03,520
I lived!

1461
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:07,820
I lived on straight up ditches!

1462
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:10,560
Someone had to live to tell the tale!

1463
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,240
I had to live!

1464
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:14,720
Look at all this cool gear I got!

1465
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,640
Sean, welcome to the tomato farm!

1466
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:18,260
Welcome!

1467
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:18,900
Welcome!

1468
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:20,740
At what cost!

1469
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:21,640
Look!

1470
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:23,500
I ran out of ammo!

1471
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,420
I'm sorry!

1472
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:28,320
I did my best!

1473
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,520
I ran out of ammo!

1474
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,180
It's not my fault!

1475
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:33,760
I swear!

1476
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:38,080
I just don't have the ammo left!

1477
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:43,520
Me and Doki made out like a bandit 07, buddy!

1478
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:45,700
Thank you for the super chat!

1479
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:46,220
Thank you!

1480
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:47,040
Thank you!

1481
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:49,220
That's cool stuff, though!

1482
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:50,740
It wasn't worth it!

1483
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:56,760
It's not my... I just... I didn't have bullets!

1484
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:58,800
I had to get out!

1485
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:07,780
That's so fun, because this guy, like, protected me and everything!

1486
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:08,880
I...

1487
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:14,720
Oh, man!

1488
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,060
I don't know if I want to queue up right away!

1489
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:19,700
I don't know if I get that guy!

1490
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:23,600
You were a cold piece, Doki, and I respected!

1491
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:26,020
Usagi, thank you with the super chat!

1492
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:26,400
Thank you!

1493
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:27,020
Thank you!

1494
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,720
Don't feel sorry, Doki!

1495
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:31,820
That was peak extraction shooter behavior!

1496
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:34,440
Candy, thank you with the super chat!

1497
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:35,040
Thank you!

1498
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:35,740
Thank you!

1499
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:37,940
Look, I tried my best, guys!

1500
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:42,180
I tried... I tried so hard to protect him, okay?

1501
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:44,340
I swear to God!

1502
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:48,940
I tried so hard to save this man's life!

1503
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:50,360
I swear!

1504
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:52,660
Alright!

1505
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:56,720
I don't know what to... I guess I'll... I'll vault this?

1506
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,400
I'll vault this one!

1507
00:58:58,580 --> 00:58:59,340
This looked good!

1508
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:03,180
This looked, like, a decent...

1509
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:06,360
Um...

1510
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,520
The action shooters are not...

1511
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:10,460
What do you mean?!

1512
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:14,840
I did the best I could!

1513
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:16,820
In that situation!

1514
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:20,120
I'm not doing you cow!

1515
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,120
Look, I'm trying...

1516
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:26,100
I'm trying to look through everything, guys!

1517
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:28,580
I'm not trying to look through my...

1518
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:40,060
I'm trying to look through all my equipment to see what I get to keep and what I should sell, guys!

1519
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:43,060
I'm making sure...

1520
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:44,760
Um...

1521
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:45,500
Alright...

1522
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:46,760
He is disappointed!

1523
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:48,060
How do you know?!

1524
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:48,940
You don't know that!

1525
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:50,380
You don't know that!

1526
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,940
Yeah, he died, so I...

1527
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:57,200
Guys, we needed one person to live!

1528
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:57,700
Okay?

1529
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:00,420
We needed at least one person to live!

1530
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:03,860
And I, unfortunately, had to be that person!

1531
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:04,830
Um...

1532
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:07,420
It was...

1533
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:08,180
A...

1534
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:09,690
Such a hard sacrifice!

1535
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:10,820
Okay?

1536
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:11,860
I...

1537
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:15,600
It was a sacrifice I had to make...

1538
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:15,860
To...

1539
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,520
Let's see...

1540
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:25,420
It was...

1541
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:26,820
It was a hard sacrifice!

1542
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:27,700
But like...

1543
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:29,120
Someone's gotta do it!

1544
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:30,640
Uh...

1545
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,460
Someone's gotta do it!

1546
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:37,720
You think I enjoyed leaving him out to die?

1547
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,700
You think I enjoyed that!

1548
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:40,300
Guys!

1549
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,180
I tried so hard!

1550
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:46,980
Okay, I do not need... I don't know.

1551
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:53,300
I feel like this stuff might be in my actual quick save.

1552
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:53,880
Okay, removes.

1553
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:55,720
Okay, this one I can sell.

1554
01:00:55,940 --> 01:00:56,760
I don't care about that.

1555
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:57,960
I'll sell this.

1556
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,980
Okay, removes.

1557
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,640
I think I don't really need that.

1558
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,440
I haven't had the hazardous thing.

1559
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,560
Advanced remain, I don't want to sell is lost upon reload.

1560
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:12,820
I don't have a gun.

1561
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:14,440
That's for this, unfortunately.

1562
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:17,620
So, uh... This is better?

1563
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:18,820
Clown quest.

1564
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:22,040
I'll vault this, actually.

1565
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:24,400
Yeah, I'll vault it.

1566
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:31,780
Uh... What do you mean he's in my chat?

1567
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:32,580
I don't see him.

1568
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:33,640
If he... Oh.

1569
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:34,900
Oh, wait, I do.

1570
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:40,660
Oh, man.

1571
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:44,360
Look at all this stuff I managed to secure in my extraction.

1572
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:46,360
Guys, look at...

1573
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,000
Wow.

1574
01:01:49,060 --> 01:01:51,900
Man, it feels good to be able to get out.

1575
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:55,020
Feels so good.

1576
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,960
Alright, I think I'll vault this, actually.

1577
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,480
And then... I don't know.

1578
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,060
I feel like I should keep this.

1579
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:04,040
But I have nothing that goes on it.

1580
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:04,900
I don't think so.

1581
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:05,240
Yeah.

1582
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:07,200
I have nothing that goes on it, so I'll...

1583
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,240
Keep it for now.

1584
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:09,900
Okay, what can I do?

1585
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:14,440
Location of nearby hostile when pinged by... You are not going to receive a warning.

1586
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:17,040
After breaking a comment, you lay leap.

1587
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:17,340
Okay.

1588
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:18,200
Yeah, that's alright.

1589
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,820
Um... How much money do I have?

1590
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:22,940
Um... Alright.

1591
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:24,020
There's my vault.

1592
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:27,020
Look at all these cool things in my vault, guys.

1593
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:27,660
Whoa.

1594
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:31,960
Damn.

1595
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:33,060
Okay.

1596
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:35,000
I need to, like, stack this, though.

1597
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,640
Uh... Wait, where did my other ammo go?

1598
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,180
Um... I'll put 120.

1599
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:44,300
Okay, nice.

1600
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:45,780
Wait.

1601
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:48,040
Actually, I'll take... I'll take that.

1602
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:49,320
I'll actually have ammo now.

1603
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:50,880
Guys, I have ammo for real now.

1604
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:54,100
I actually have ammo now.

1605
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:54,560
Okay.

1606
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:55,880
And I'll grab shields.

1607
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,420
I'll put this away.

1608
01:02:59,360 --> 01:02:59,900
All right.

1609
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:00,600
Guys, look.

1610
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:02,320
I have ammo now.

1611
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:04,100
Guys, isn't that great?

1612
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:05,920
I actually have bullets.

1613
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:10,620
All right.

1614
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:12,280
All right, guys.

1615
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:12,720
You know what?

1616
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:14,940
I think I do like the fact...

1617
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:16,020
Oh, I can buy more ammo.

1618
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:16,900
How much money do I have?

1619
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:20,440
Uh... Wait, does it say how much money I have?

1620
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:20,760
Okay.

1621
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:21,920
I have a thousand.

1622
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:23,500
Okay, this is enough ammo.

1623
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:24,280
I think this is enough.

1624
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,140
Actually, I'll buy more.

1625
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:28,700
Let's just buy more just in case.

1626
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,680
Because I feel like I'll always need more.

1627
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:31,880
I'll...

1628
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:32,420
Let's...

1629
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:32,660
Let's...

1630
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:34,320
You know, let's full stock the ammo.

1631
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,000
That was very rough for me.

1632
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:39,620
That was incredibly rough with the lack of ammo situation.

1633
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:40,620
All right.

1634
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:41,840
All right.

1635
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:42,420
You know what?

1636
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:45,020
I enjoyed having crew fill on.

1637
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:45,660
I...

1638
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:47,440
I enjoy having teammates, guys.

1639
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:49,700
Let's have teammates again.

1640
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:50,840
Guys.

1641
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:52,520
I think having teammates was...

1642
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:54,040
Was the play.

1643
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:58,680
I think...

1644
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:02,960
I think it was good that we had teammates with us.

1645
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:04,400
It was definitely the play.

1646
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:06,300
Actually, let me check my loadout again.

1647
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:07,760
Um...

1648
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:08,860
I don't know if I should keep...

1649
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:09,440
You know what?

1650
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:10,040
Let's try it.

1651
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:10,600
Let's...

1652
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:11,960
Let's get the eight slots.

1653
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:20,410
The trick to life is knowing that unless you are a Doki, you are never the main character.

1654
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:21,710
Obscure.

1655
01:04:21,910 --> 01:04:23,550
Thank you for the super chat.

1656
01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:24,110
Thank you.

1657
01:04:24,270 --> 01:04:24,690
Thank you.

1658
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:26,090
I think having...

1659
01:04:26,090 --> 01:04:28,670
Having teammates was definitely the play.

1660
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:29,430
You know?

1661
01:04:29,670 --> 01:04:30,170
Having...

1662
01:04:30,170 --> 01:04:31,450
Having like...

1663
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:34,230
People I can use as meat shields.

1664
01:04:34,810 --> 01:04:35,050
Yeah.

1665
01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:37,170
You mean meat shields, right?

1666
01:04:37,370 --> 01:04:37,510
Yeah.

1667
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:42,310
Both guns use the same ammo.

1668
01:04:42,550 --> 01:04:43,630
Yeah, but I only have...

1669
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:43,930
Like...

1670
01:04:43,930 --> 01:04:45,230
I don't have any other guns.

1671
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:45,990
I literally...

1672
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:47,470
I don't even have a pistol at the moment.

1673
01:04:47,590 --> 01:04:48,910
I think I accidentally like...

1674
01:04:48,910 --> 01:04:50,910
I threw away my pistols accidentally.

1675
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:51,870
Alright.

1676
01:04:52,450 --> 01:04:53,150
Here we go.

1677
01:04:54,230 --> 01:04:58,110
We have a British man in chibs.

1678
01:04:58,810 --> 01:04:58,930
Alright.

1679
01:04:59,370 --> 01:05:00,930
Can't be that bad this time, right?

1680
01:05:02,510 --> 01:05:05,170
Like this time, things won't be that bad.

1681
01:05:07,090 --> 01:05:08,890
Things will be fine this time.

1682
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:10,850
Oh, wait.

1683
01:05:11,070 --> 01:05:11,170
Oh, wait.

1684
01:05:11,170 --> 01:05:11,850
What the fuck?

1685
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:14,850
Give me a Terran's key for this.

1686
01:05:15,350 --> 01:05:16,070
We'll get this gun.

1687
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:17,270
Alright.

1688
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:19,030
Oh my god.

1689
01:05:19,090 --> 01:05:20,690
These guys have definitely played already.

1690
01:05:21,030 --> 01:05:21,930
They knew...

1691
01:05:21,930 --> 01:05:23,810
They knew instantly where to go.

1692
01:05:23,810 --> 01:05:24,510
I was confused.

1693
01:05:27,070 --> 01:05:29,830
No, I didn't manage my sprint.

1694
01:05:30,570 --> 01:05:31,390
Not the one.

1695
01:05:32,790 --> 01:05:35,130
Bro, these guys instantly knew what to do.

1696
01:05:35,270 --> 01:05:37,410
I'm still learning at the moment.

1697
01:05:37,910 --> 01:05:39,430
I'm like still confused.

1698
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:41,930
Like, where are my teammates?

1699
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:43,490
Where did they go?

1700
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:48,450
Where did they all go?

1701
01:05:48,870 --> 01:05:49,210
Hello.

1702
01:05:53,270 --> 01:05:53,750
Alright.

1703
01:05:56,610 --> 01:05:58,070
Alright, they definitely know how to...

1704
01:05:58,070 --> 01:06:00,510
These guys actually know how to shoot their guns too.

1705
01:06:00,730 --> 01:06:01,210
Which is great.

1706
01:06:02,450 --> 01:06:02,850
Whoa!

1707
01:06:03,950 --> 01:06:05,270
Yoink, yoink, yoink.

1708
01:06:06,090 --> 01:06:06,990
Oh my god.

1709
01:06:07,110 --> 01:06:07,730
That's a shotgun.

1710
01:06:07,950 --> 01:06:08,250
Yoink.

1711
01:06:08,910 --> 01:06:10,310
Wait, do I have ammo for a shotgun?

1712
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:16,130
I do not.

1713
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:24,420
Wait, where are I...

1714
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:25,660
Where's the rest of my team?

1715
01:06:30,910 --> 01:06:31,770
I did it.

1716
01:06:34,050 --> 01:06:34,770
Let's see.

1717
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:36,650
Yoink, yoink, yoink, yoink.

1718
01:06:36,850 --> 01:06:38,490
I have full inventory now.

1719
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:40,830
Wait, what's this?

1720
01:06:41,890 --> 01:06:42,410
Decoding?

1721
01:06:45,790 --> 01:06:46,310
Yay!

1722
01:06:49,450 --> 01:06:51,030
Wait, there's ammo in that locker?

1723
01:06:51,170 --> 01:06:51,530
This one?

1724
01:06:51,790 --> 01:06:52,570
Oh, there was!

1725
01:06:52,890 --> 01:06:53,950
Okay, we don't...

1726
01:06:53,950 --> 01:06:54,970
We have too much shield charge.

1727
01:06:55,870 --> 01:06:56,930
We can get rid of that.

1728
01:06:58,010 --> 01:06:58,710
Alright, nice.

1729
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:02,030
I want to try my shotgun out.

1730
01:07:04,050 --> 01:07:04,450
Alright.

1731
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:07,130
Hello, guys.

1732
01:07:07,330 --> 01:07:09,630
I still don't understand the decoding shit, so...

1733
01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:12,790
I'm still a little confused, but I have spirit.

1734
01:07:16,270 --> 01:07:16,730
I have spirit.

1735
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:18,930
Axis denied.

1736
01:07:19,170 --> 01:07:19,290
Yay!

1737
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:21,490
I have spirit, though.

1738
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:23,330
Bum, bum, bum.

1739
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:24,330
Bum, bum, bum.

1740
01:07:25,330 --> 01:07:26,210
A little battery.

1741
01:07:26,410 --> 01:07:28,550
I feel like I should get rid of someone.

1742
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:29,050
Oh, wait.

1743
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:30,070
This is $60.

1744
01:07:33,230 --> 01:07:35,130
Like, some of these things, I don't understand.

1745
01:07:35,130 --> 01:07:35,310
Oh, my God.

1746
01:07:37,290 --> 01:07:37,930
Oh.

1747
01:07:39,350 --> 01:07:40,290
Is he fat?

1748
01:07:40,510 --> 01:07:41,330
Is he okay?

1749
01:07:42,950 --> 01:07:43,790
Oh, shit.

1750
01:07:44,250 --> 01:07:44,890
Whoops.

1751
01:07:45,330 --> 01:07:47,590
My mouse hit the left click accidentally.

1752
01:07:48,150 --> 01:07:48,450
Don't worry.

1753
01:07:48,530 --> 01:07:49,010
I got it.

1754
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:53,880
I got spirit.

1755
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:55,200
Yay!

1756
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:56,020
Yay!

1757
01:07:57,380 --> 01:07:58,340
Survey tool?

1758
01:07:58,820 --> 01:07:59,460
Wait.

1759
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:00,320
That's valuable.

1760
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:01,680
I don't need this.

1761
01:08:05,050 --> 01:08:05,510
Nice.

1762
01:08:05,810 --> 01:08:07,770
I don't know what it is, but it says valuable.

1763
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:10,090
Where's my teammate?

1764
01:08:10,890 --> 01:08:12,170
Look, the Brit, where are you going?

1765
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:16,760
What?

1766
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:20,280
Wait, what?

1767
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:21,200
I came from here.

1768
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:25,100
Oh, I can go out, but I can't go in with it.

1769
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:25,540
Oh.

1770
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:26,400
Whoa!

1771
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:29,400
Wait, this gun's better.

1772
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:32,260
Wait.

1773
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:37,060
And I'll take this.

1774
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:41,080
Uh, heavy rounds?

1775
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:42,140
What do I not need?

1776
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:45,020
Alright, nice.

1777
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:49,570
I have cool guns now.

1778
01:08:49,790 --> 01:08:50,210
Guys, look.

1779
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:51,690
Look at my cool gun.

1780
01:08:53,090 --> 01:08:54,370
No, it's okay, guys.

1781
01:08:54,570 --> 01:08:55,330
Don't worry.

1782
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:56,170
It'll be fine.

1783
01:08:58,170 --> 01:08:58,870
Don't worry.

1784
01:08:58,970 --> 01:09:00,490
I have two cool guns, though.

1785
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:02,930
But look at these sick guns that I have.

1786
01:09:05,010 --> 01:09:05,810
It's fine.

1787
01:09:05,990 --> 01:09:06,410
It's fine.

1788
01:09:06,650 --> 01:09:08,350
I have actual players.

1789
01:09:12,930 --> 01:09:15,590
Not that I'm saying Solar was not a real player.

1790
01:09:15,810 --> 01:09:18,630
I'm just saying that, like, not two real players.

1791
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:23,190
I have two real players.

1792
01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:24,910
That's different instead of one.

1793
01:09:25,450 --> 01:09:27,330
Instead of one real player, I have two.

1794
01:09:31,890 --> 01:09:32,770
Oh, shit.

1795
01:09:32,910 --> 01:09:32,950
Oh, shit.

1796
01:09:32,950 --> 01:09:34,770
Wait, this gun is- this gun is crazy.

1797
01:09:36,070 --> 01:09:36,630
Look at that!

1798
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:38,970
Look, this guy instantly went high ground.

1799
01:09:39,310 --> 01:09:41,570
Guys, this guy, he knows what's up.

1800
01:09:43,530 --> 01:09:45,470
He instantly went high ground.

1801
01:09:46,010 --> 01:09:47,430
That's a gamer right there.

1802
01:09:53,530 --> 01:09:54,730
All right, let's see.

1803
01:09:55,230 --> 01:09:57,990
I don't have any- a lot of stuff.

1804
01:09:58,790 --> 01:10:02,910
I'm, like, a little- Simple recall window closes in 20 minutes.

1805
01:10:02,910 --> 01:10:03,830
Okay.

1806
01:10:04,550 --> 01:10:04,770
Okay.

1807
01:10:04,770 --> 01:10:05,410
Oh, there's food.

1808
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:06,530
There's samples.

1809
01:10:06,730 --> 01:10:07,030
Whoa!

1810
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:08,430
Wait a minute.

1811
01:10:08,810 --> 01:10:09,670
I want that.

1812
01:10:10,690 --> 01:10:11,950
What can I get rid of, though?

1813
01:10:13,090 --> 01:10:14,070
Wait, I want that.

1814
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:15,290
That's $540.

1815
01:10:15,930 --> 01:10:16,550
Holy shit.

1816
01:10:16,930 --> 01:10:17,210
Wait.

1817
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:19,930
High zoom optic?

1818
01:10:20,110 --> 01:10:21,590
Does that work for anything I have?

1819
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:24,210
I don't think so.

1820
01:10:25,130 --> 01:10:26,350
That shit looks nice.

1821
01:10:26,570 --> 01:10:27,190
It's purple.

1822
01:10:27,610 --> 01:10:28,610
That means it's good.

1823
01:10:29,570 --> 01:10:30,470
Where's my wrist?

1824
01:10:32,230 --> 01:10:33,670
Wait, are these all the good shit?

1825
01:10:33,910 --> 01:10:34,690
Oh, they are.

1826
01:10:36,570 --> 01:10:41,350
Guys, I'm, like- I'm really bad at the looting part of an extraction chain.

1827
01:10:43,690 --> 01:10:49,090
Guys, is it noticeable that I'm- I'm, like, really confused when it comes to looting?

1828
01:10:49,270 --> 01:10:50,510
Is- You think it's noticeable?

1829
01:10:55,370 --> 01:10:57,470
Oh, was it actually blinking on my gun?

1830
01:10:57,750 --> 01:10:59,010
They, like- Oh, they took it.

1831
01:10:59,890 --> 01:11:01,110
They already took it, guys.

1832
01:11:01,770 --> 01:11:04,850
I couldn't- For some reason, it wouldn't let me- It wouldn't let me take it.

1833
01:11:06,870 --> 01:11:07,870
Oh, data card.

1834
01:11:09,490 --> 01:11:10,890
Wait, where did my team go?

1835
01:11:11,390 --> 01:11:12,690
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1836
01:11:12,930 --> 01:11:13,990
Guys, please.

1837
01:11:19,970 --> 01:11:20,370
Alright.

1838
01:11:21,830 --> 01:11:24,770
Oh my god, these guys, like, take- These guys actually know what they're doing.

1839
01:11:25,010 --> 01:11:26,430
They're taking high ground and everything.

1840
01:11:27,630 --> 01:11:27,970
Guys.

1841
01:11:29,130 --> 01:11:31,170
Just fall damage, but it's, like, 1 HP.

1842
01:11:34,310 --> 01:11:35,990
Oh, it was highlighted in white?

1843
01:11:36,410 --> 01:11:37,530
Oh, that's fine.

1844
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:38,010
It's fine.

1845
01:11:38,090 --> 01:11:38,670
I don't need it.

1846
01:11:42,850 --> 01:11:44,210
I believe in my team.

1847
01:11:46,790 --> 01:11:48,730
Try to put a square in.

1848
01:11:49,070 --> 01:11:49,510
What?

1849
01:11:49,930 --> 01:11:52,030
It goes in the triangle hole.

1850
01:11:52,190 --> 01:11:52,650
Does it not?

1851
01:11:54,670 --> 01:11:56,410
I thought he goes in the triangle.

1852
01:11:58,610 --> 01:12:00,650
I haven't seen, like, real players yet.

1853
01:12:03,090 --> 01:12:03,530
Oh.

1854
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:05,270
Is there a real player over there?

1855
01:12:05,730 --> 01:12:07,030
Don't worry, I believe in us.

1856
01:12:10,430 --> 01:12:12,650
I have to, like- I hate stamina management.

1857
01:12:13,550 --> 01:12:14,730
I'm so bad at it.

1858
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:19,480
Oh, wait.

1859
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:20,660
There's people fighting already.

1860
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,460
Wait, there's people wanting to extract here.

1861
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,600
No, no, there's actual players.

1862
01:12:27,820 --> 01:12:29,000
Because you can hear a fight.

1863
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,240
There's people actually extracting.

1864
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:37,040
Wait, there's people here, I'm pretty sure.

1865
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:41,420
Yeah.

1866
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:44,500
I mean, I could press Q.

1867
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:47,400
I don't know if they hear me, though.

1868
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:54,840
There's two over there.

1869
01:13:06,460 --> 01:13:07,100
Oh, no.

1870
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:07,800
Luke the Brit.

1871
01:13:12,670 --> 01:13:13,390
Oh, no.

1872
01:13:13,550 --> 01:13:15,690
He got fully eliminated.

1873
01:13:16,650 --> 01:13:17,810
Oh, no.

1874
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:20,430
No, buddy.

1875
01:13:22,150 --> 01:13:23,610
Get out of here.

1876
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:26,770
I'm sorry, buddy.

1877
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:32,000
Oh, no.

1878
01:13:32,860 --> 01:13:33,600
Luka.

1879
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:35,080
The Brit.

1880
01:13:41,940 --> 01:13:44,300
All right, look at the good shit, though.

1881
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,320
Look at the good shit.

1882
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:49,860
Don't worry, Luka.

1883
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:50,740
We got you.

1884
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:53,120
Look at all the good shit he has.

1885
01:13:54,380 --> 01:13:55,240
Oh, my God.

1886
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:56,760
Look at all the good shit he has.

1887
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:57,480
What the fuck?

1888
01:13:59,160 --> 01:13:59,600
Yoink.

1889
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:01,580
Yoink, yoink, yoink.

1890
01:14:07,250 --> 01:14:08,230
All right, nice.

1891
01:14:08,670 --> 01:14:09,450
What does he have?

1892
01:14:10,450 --> 01:14:10,890
Whoa.

1893
01:14:12,710 --> 01:14:14,370
I don't know what all of these are.

1894
01:14:14,490 --> 01:14:15,310
But they look good.

1895
01:14:16,710 --> 01:14:17,970
I have no idea.

1896
01:14:19,030 --> 01:14:20,990
Um, I don't know.

1897
01:14:25,710 --> 01:14:27,770
I'm just like, I don't know.

1898
01:14:28,530 --> 01:14:29,790
They look good, though.

1899
01:14:30,530 --> 01:14:30,930
No.

1900
01:14:33,070 --> 01:14:34,550
Um, oh, my God.

1901
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:35,910
This guy had...

1902
01:14:35,910 --> 01:14:36,410
What?

1903
01:14:36,610 --> 01:14:37,750
This guy had everything.

1904
01:14:41,090 --> 01:14:42,570
He's lost to carry more items?

1905
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:43,150
What the fuck?

1906
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:44,310
This guy instantly took it.

1907
01:14:48,810 --> 01:14:50,570
Oh, he had, like, shit guns, though.

1908
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:56,320
A little.

1909
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,800
15 minutes until signal lost.

1910
01:14:59,100 --> 01:14:59,860
Should we, like, leave?

1911
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:03,160
Who are these people, anyway?

1912
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:04,140
WSTR?

1913
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:07,260
No name.

1914
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:08,860
Oh, they left.

1915
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:10,440
So we'll never know who his name was.

1916
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:12,380
This guy is still...

1917
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:13,660
This guy is still here.

1918
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:15,200
He's still spectating.

1919
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:15,500
Oh, wait.

1920
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:15,840
Never mind.

1921
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:16,240
He's gone.

1922
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:19,040
He's gone.

1923
01:15:21,740 --> 01:15:22,520
Never mind.

1924
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:24,620
Wait, what are we doing?

1925
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:27,720
Why are we all just hiding like this, guys?

1926
01:15:28,180 --> 01:15:29,260
What's going on?

1927
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:30,140
Where are we...

1928
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:31,160
Where are we hiding from?

1929
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:32,160
I'm a little concerned.

1930
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:34,160
What are we...

1931
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:38,560
Where are we hiding from?

1932
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:42,080
Oh.

1933
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:43,860
There's, like, people now.

1934
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:47,360
I've got spirit, though.

1935
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:51,680
Can we leave?

1936
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:53,440
Damn, what?

1937
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:57,800
Oh.

1938
01:15:58,040 --> 01:15:58,780
Triggering exfil.

1939
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:00,000
Oh, exfil.

1940
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:02,900
Don't worry.

1941
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:03,640
I've got spirit.

1942
01:16:09,890 --> 01:16:10,610
Alright.

1943
01:16:11,290 --> 01:16:12,070
Don't worry.

1944
01:16:13,690 --> 01:16:15,150
I always got the spirit.

1945
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:19,600
Alright, nice.

1946
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:23,140
Wait, where's the exfil?

1947
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:24,880
Oh, it's over there.

1948
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:29,580
Oh, it's right here.

1949
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:31,600
Alright, how long?

1950
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:34,900
30 seconds.

1951
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:35,860
Don't worry, chips.

1952
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:36,440
I believe.

1953
01:16:37,660 --> 01:16:39,120
I'm gonna keep my stuff.

1954
01:16:43,550 --> 01:16:44,470
Don't worry.

1955
01:16:47,050 --> 01:16:48,210
Alright, nice.

1956
01:16:48,210 --> 01:16:48,950
Look at that!

1957
01:16:49,550 --> 01:16:50,250
See?

1958
01:16:50,530 --> 01:16:52,150
I just needed better teeth.

1959
01:16:52,790 --> 01:16:52,930
Please.

1960
01:16:56,330 --> 01:16:57,690
We all live.

1961
01:17:00,430 --> 01:17:01,690
Look at that!

1962
01:17:05,210 --> 01:17:07,190
I'm just saying, it wasn't me.

1963
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:14,270
I did it, bro.

1964
01:17:16,530 --> 01:17:20,350
I'm gonna say that we all live there.

1965
01:17:24,430 --> 01:17:29,390
They died for you, Toki.

1966
01:17:29,990 --> 01:17:32,910
Well, they didn't have to die for me.

1967
01:17:37,830 --> 01:17:38,550
Yay!

1968
01:17:38,550 --> 01:17:40,290
We're all alive!

1969
01:17:43,810 --> 01:17:45,290
We did it!

1970
01:17:48,090 --> 01:17:49,750
We did it!

1971
01:17:49,990 --> 01:17:51,150
They were new too!

1972
01:17:52,150 --> 01:17:54,470
My teammates were also new!

1973
01:18:00,290 --> 01:18:01,410
We did it.

1974
01:18:01,490 --> 01:18:03,410
I actually really like the gun I had.

1975
01:18:07,430 --> 01:18:10,130
My report... Oh my god, we fought real people too!

1976
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:11,430
Yeah, we're better.

1977
01:18:12,150 --> 01:18:13,230
We're actually better.

1978
01:18:13,370 --> 01:18:14,190
We fought real people.

1979
01:18:14,410 --> 01:18:15,490
Does it tell me who I killed?

1980
01:18:15,790 --> 01:18:16,890
I wish it does.

1981
01:18:17,530 --> 01:18:18,730
I wish it tells me who I killed.

1982
01:18:19,510 --> 01:18:22,730
Lady Doki Birdhouse Parquat does it again.

1983
01:18:25,670 --> 01:18:26,530
Alright, let's see.

1984
01:18:26,550 --> 01:18:27,830
Oh, I completed some missions.

1985
01:18:28,590 --> 01:18:29,190
I did.

1986
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:29,890
Claim reward.

1987
01:18:30,810 --> 01:18:31,750
Lore time!

1988
01:18:32,530 --> 01:18:35,310
You have reached the final step of your reorientation.

1989
01:18:36,130 --> 01:18:41,710
I must now draw attention to the considerable financial investment your replacement shells represent.

1990
01:18:42,850 --> 01:18:45,410
When you experience death, cyber acne...

1991
01:18:45,410 --> 01:18:46,210
How is this game?

1992
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:47,690
It's an extraction shooter.

1993
01:18:47,970 --> 01:18:49,410
That's really how I could explain it.

1994
01:18:49,990 --> 01:18:50,830
Like, it's...

1995
01:18:50,830 --> 01:18:55,770
I'll just say it's no different than the other extraction shooters I've played.

1996
01:18:59,570 --> 01:19:01,230
I'm just very confused.

1997
01:19:02,670 --> 01:19:06,570
The biggest issue I have right now is that...

1998
01:19:08,630 --> 01:19:12,230
The only issue I have right now is that...

1999
01:19:13,990 --> 01:19:18,290
The items are very confusing because they're all their own unique things.

2000
01:19:18,490 --> 01:19:19,390
Like, it's not, you know...

2001
01:19:19,390 --> 01:19:23,530
I guess in Tarkov, you can sort of tell what's what because it's based off of real life stuff.

2002
01:19:23,790 --> 01:19:28,670
But in Marathon, they all have their own unique names and everything.

2003
01:19:28,670 --> 01:19:31,470
So I don't know the looting system for this.

2004
01:19:31,550 --> 01:19:33,830
I'm so fucking confused when I'm looting.

2005
01:19:34,630 --> 01:19:35,270
I'm...

2006
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:36,470
I'm like...

2007
01:19:36,470 --> 01:19:39,030
Like, you have to actually learn...

2008
01:19:39,030 --> 01:19:42,070
You have to learn, um, what your loot is.

2009
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:42,850
So...

2010
01:19:42,850 --> 01:19:45,050
I don't know what the fuck I'm looting.

2011
01:19:45,530 --> 01:19:46,490
I actually...

2012
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:47,350
I don't know.

2013
01:19:47,530 --> 01:19:49,210
I'm so confused.

2014
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:51,550
Alright.

2015
01:19:51,830 --> 01:19:54,070
I really like the repeater.

2016
01:19:54,270 --> 01:19:54,490
This...

2017
01:19:54,490 --> 01:19:55,630
This gun is really good.

2018
01:19:55,630 --> 01:19:57,250
And I'm scared I'm gonna lose it.

2019
01:19:57,390 --> 01:20:00,990
I love it a lot and I'm scared that I'll lose this gun.

2020
01:20:02,450 --> 01:20:03,490
What's on this?

2021
01:20:03,650 --> 01:20:04,570
Okay, um...

2022
01:20:04,570 --> 01:20:05,230
I'm gonna keep that.

2023
01:20:05,410 --> 01:20:06,090
Oracle Lens.

2024
01:20:06,870 --> 01:20:08,390
Oh, I don't have it for this.

2025
01:20:08,950 --> 01:20:09,350
Um...

2026
01:20:09,350 --> 01:20:10,310
This does...

2027
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:11,150
This ammo...

2028
01:20:11,150 --> 01:20:11,530
And heavy.

2029
01:20:12,830 --> 01:20:13,230
Um...

2030
01:20:14,770 --> 01:20:16,150
Let's take this...

2031
01:20:16,650 --> 01:20:19,890
We don't need that much ammo for this gun in particular, I feel.

2032
01:20:24,170 --> 01:20:24,570
Uh...

2033
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:25,550
And then move to vault.

2034
01:20:25,670 --> 01:20:25,830
Yeah.

2035
01:20:26,410 --> 01:20:27,170
Yeah, I...

2036
01:20:27,170 --> 01:20:29,310
This is a really good gun and I feel like...

2037
01:20:29,310 --> 01:20:29,630
You know what?

2038
01:20:29,710 --> 01:20:30,450
Fuck it, it's alpha.

2039
01:20:30,670 --> 01:20:31,210
It doesn't matter.

2040
01:20:32,070 --> 01:20:32,470
Um...

2041
01:20:32,470 --> 01:20:33,130
What ammo?

2042
01:20:33,310 --> 01:20:34,230
It doesn't need this.

2043
01:20:34,270 --> 01:20:35,090
It doesn't need that.

2044
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:36,170
It just needs these three.

2045
01:20:36,170 --> 01:20:36,530
Okay.

2046
01:20:37,490 --> 01:20:38,050
I...

2047
01:20:38,050 --> 01:20:39,170
Won't be surprised.

2048
01:20:39,450 --> 01:20:40,190
Your knife for heavy.

2049
01:20:40,370 --> 01:20:40,870
Brief...

2050
01:20:40,870 --> 01:20:42,330
Okay, I'm gonna put this away.

2051
01:20:42,830 --> 01:20:43,650
Your base shields.

2052
01:20:43,850 --> 01:20:46,230
If feeding anyone grabs a stacking bullets to your agility.

2053
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:47,890
We don't need that.

2054
01:20:48,450 --> 01:20:49,270
Hand grenade.

2055
01:20:49,970 --> 01:20:50,950
All implants.

2056
01:20:51,830 --> 01:20:52,390
Alright.

2057
01:20:54,530 --> 01:20:55,650
I guess...

2058
01:20:55,650 --> 01:20:56,270
We'll do...

2059
01:20:56,270 --> 01:20:57,170
We'll do one more.

2060
01:20:57,370 --> 01:20:58,090
We'll do one more.

2061
01:20:58,690 --> 01:21:01,370
And I think I know what this game is about.

2062
01:21:01,370 --> 01:21:02,190
Hahaha.

2063
01:21:03,390 --> 01:21:04,950
No, let's try the Dire Marsh.

2064
01:21:06,670 --> 01:21:07,510
What's the difference?

2065
01:21:07,850 --> 01:21:08,290
There's nothing.

2066
01:21:08,410 --> 01:21:09,030
Oh, it's just...

2067
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:09,690
Area is different.

2068
01:21:09,770 --> 01:21:10,330
Let's try this.

2069
01:21:11,050 --> 01:21:11,470
Alright.

2070
01:21:11,770 --> 01:21:12,290
Ready up.

2071
01:21:12,670 --> 01:21:14,330
Ooh, I have some really good equipment.

2072
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:14,990
Haha.

2073
01:21:15,930 --> 01:21:16,670
Let's go.

2074
01:21:18,350 --> 01:21:20,130
Cast away your gear fear.

2075
01:21:20,130 --> 01:21:20,750
I know.

2076
01:21:20,950 --> 01:21:23,070
I'm so scared of losing my gear, guys.

2077
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:23,930
Uh...

2078
01:21:23,930 --> 01:21:24,770
Simple Minded.

2079
01:21:24,850 --> 01:21:25,730
Thank you for the super chat.

2080
01:21:25,830 --> 01:21:26,090
Thank you.

2081
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:26,630
Thank you.

2082
01:21:26,790 --> 01:21:29,070
Doki really putting the me in team the stream.

2083
01:21:29,290 --> 01:21:32,270
I'm starting to think those wins in Marvel Reivals weren't all skill.

2084
01:21:33,230 --> 01:21:34,790
Thank you for the super chat.

2085
01:21:34,910 --> 01:21:35,770
Simple Minded.

2086
01:21:35,930 --> 01:21:36,230
Thank you.

2087
01:21:36,370 --> 01:21:36,890
Thank you.

2088
01:21:39,610 --> 01:21:40,170
Um...

2089
01:21:40,170 --> 01:21:41,030
Yeah, I...

2090
01:21:41,030 --> 01:21:42,270
So far...

2091
01:21:42,270 --> 01:21:43,250
I just...

2092
01:21:43,250 --> 01:21:44,390
So far...

2093
01:21:44,390 --> 01:21:45,230
I just think this...

2094
01:21:45,230 --> 01:21:47,190
It just feels like an extraction shooter.

2095
01:21:48,030 --> 01:21:48,590
So...

2096
01:21:49,550 --> 01:21:50,110
Uh...

2097
01:21:50,110 --> 01:21:51,190
So, like...

2098
01:21:51,790 --> 01:21:52,350
Um...

2099
01:21:52,350 --> 01:21:53,150
I...

2100
01:21:53,150 --> 01:21:53,710
Really...

2101
01:21:53,710 --> 01:21:53,750
That...

2102
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:56,310
It's how I feel about most extraction shooters.

2103
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:57,210
And...

2104
01:21:57,210 --> 01:21:57,850
To me...

2105
01:21:57,850 --> 01:22:00,210
Extraction shooters all feel the same.

2106
01:22:00,650 --> 01:22:01,150
For me.

2107
01:22:01,490 --> 01:22:01,790
Uh...

2108
01:22:01,790 --> 01:22:02,070
So...

2109
01:22:02,070 --> 01:22:04,770
I don't really have much other opinion other than...

2110
01:22:04,770 --> 01:22:06,690
I'm just playing extraction shooter.

2111
01:22:06,910 --> 01:22:07,290
Hahaha.

2112
01:22:08,310 --> 01:22:08,890
Hahaha.

2113
01:22:09,930 --> 01:22:10,530
Um...

2114
01:22:10,530 --> 01:22:11,870
I am getting like...

2115
01:22:11,870 --> 01:22:12,210
I do...

2116
01:22:12,210 --> 01:22:15,210
I'm getting really confused with the type of gear...

2117
01:22:15,470 --> 01:22:16,350
That I have.

2118
01:22:16,510 --> 01:22:18,030
And what I'm trying to loot.

2119
01:22:18,070 --> 01:22:19,470
I do like the guns.

2120
01:22:19,730 --> 01:22:20,610
The guns are fun.

2121
01:22:20,930 --> 01:22:22,410
Cause they're not like regular...

2122
01:22:22,410 --> 01:22:23,270
I guess they're like...

2123
01:22:23,270 --> 01:22:25,090
Based off of destiny guns too.

2124
01:22:25,830 --> 01:22:26,350
So...

2125
01:22:26,350 --> 01:22:26,530
Like...

2126
01:22:26,530 --> 01:22:26,830
You know...

2127
01:22:26,830 --> 01:22:27,470
I think like...

2128
01:22:27,470 --> 01:22:28,890
What Bungie does really well...

2129
01:22:28,890 --> 01:22:30,570
Is just making cool guns.

2130
01:22:31,290 --> 01:22:31,810
So...

2131
01:22:32,410 --> 01:22:32,710
Uh...

2132
01:22:32,710 --> 01:22:33,490
So like...

2133
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:34,250
That's fun.

2134
01:22:34,530 --> 01:22:35,370
I get the gun...

2135
01:22:35,370 --> 01:22:36,050
Guns are fun.

2136
01:22:36,670 --> 01:22:37,190
But...

2137
01:22:37,930 --> 01:22:38,450
Um...

2138
01:22:38,450 --> 01:22:39,230
Uh...

2139
01:22:39,230 --> 01:22:40,550
The ability...

2140
01:22:40,550 --> 01:22:40,870
The one...

2141
01:22:40,870 --> 01:22:42,010
The one I'm using right now...

2142
01:22:42,010 --> 01:22:43,810
I do like the person I'm using for the abilities.

2143
01:22:48,010 --> 01:22:49,190
It's cause you don't read.

2144
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:49,970
There's also that.

2145
01:22:50,230 --> 01:22:50,650
Okay.

2146
01:22:50,870 --> 01:22:51,410
Alright guys.

2147
01:22:51,410 --> 01:22:52,850
We have Popsicle Liquor.

2148
01:22:53,070 --> 01:22:53,690
And...

2149
01:22:53,690 --> 01:22:54,190
Telly.

2150
01:22:54,370 --> 01:22:55,950
I don't know how great they...

2151
01:22:55,950 --> 01:22:56,730
These guys are.

2152
01:22:56,990 --> 01:22:57,610
But I...

2153
01:22:57,610 --> 01:22:58,850
I think they have spirit.

2154
01:22:59,330 --> 01:22:59,710
I...

2155
01:23:02,450 --> 01:23:03,700
They seem like...

2156
01:23:05,990 --> 01:23:07,530
They seem like...

2157
01:23:07,530 --> 01:23:07,550
They seem like...

2158
01:23:07,550 --> 01:23:08,370
They have...

2159
01:23:08,370 --> 01:23:09,550
The spirit...

2160
01:23:09,550 --> 01:23:10,330
For this game.

2161
01:23:27,010 --> 01:23:35,830
They have spirit.

2162
01:23:36,010 --> 01:23:36,670
Just like me.

2163
01:23:36,890 --> 01:23:37,490
You have spirit.

2164
01:23:37,670 --> 01:23:38,170
Yes you do.

2165
01:23:38,970 --> 01:23:39,850
You have spirit.

2166
01:23:39,850 --> 01:23:40,030
What?

2167
01:23:40,150 --> 01:23:41,030
How about you?

2168
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:44,290
Alright.

2169
01:23:44,490 --> 01:23:44,910
Let's see.

2170
01:23:45,090 --> 01:23:45,250
Ooh.

2171
01:23:45,650 --> 01:23:45,910
Health.

2172
01:23:46,570 --> 01:23:47,750
Don't really need health though.

2173
01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:48,290
To be fair.

2174
01:23:49,130 --> 01:23:49,570
Ooh.

2175
01:23:49,590 --> 01:23:50,810
I hear gunshots though.

2176
01:23:52,070 --> 01:23:53,110
I'm a little scared.

2177
01:23:53,510 --> 01:23:54,810
I'm a little spooked out.

2178
01:23:55,610 --> 01:23:55,990
Oh.

2179
01:23:56,090 --> 01:23:56,950
There's someone's been here.

2180
01:23:57,030 --> 01:23:57,830
Cause the door is open.

2181
01:23:59,490 --> 01:23:59,930
Wait.

2182
01:24:00,070 --> 01:24:00,170
What?

2183
01:24:00,350 --> 01:24:00,650
Telly.

2184
01:24:00,770 --> 01:24:00,910
How?

2185
01:24:02,230 --> 01:24:02,670
Telly.

2186
01:24:02,790 --> 01:24:03,310
What the fuck?

2187
01:24:03,350 --> 01:24:03,790
Telly.

2188
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:05,230
Telly.

2189
01:24:05,350 --> 01:24:05,970
What the fuck?

2190
01:24:05,990 --> 01:24:07,010
Who's shooting at you?

2191
01:24:07,010 --> 01:24:07,370
Buddy?

2192
01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:09,470
What?

2193
01:24:10,970 --> 01:24:11,950
Oh no.

2194
01:24:13,410 --> 01:24:14,270
Oh no.

2195
01:24:14,370 --> 01:24:14,790
Telly.

2196
01:24:15,010 --> 01:24:16,230
You have too much spirit.

2197
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:25,750
He's just a regular guy.

2198
01:24:26,650 --> 01:24:28,530
Telly has too much spirit, guys.

2199
01:24:32,930 --> 01:24:33,490
Alright.

2200
01:24:36,150 --> 01:24:37,010
Here we go.

2201
01:24:37,950 --> 01:24:38,170
Alright.

2202
01:24:38,350 --> 01:24:38,710
Telly.

2203
01:24:39,330 --> 01:24:39,890
Telly.

2204
01:24:39,990 --> 01:24:41,090
You have too much spirit.

2205
01:24:41,110 --> 01:24:42,030
But I got you.

2206
01:24:47,630 --> 01:24:49,290
You died to an NPC.

2207
01:24:49,650 --> 01:24:50,970
So that's a little awkward.

2208
01:24:52,450 --> 01:24:53,330
Oh man.

2209
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:53,870
Guys.

2210
01:24:54,090 --> 01:24:55,350
I don't feel good about this team.

2211
01:24:55,450 --> 01:24:56,930
Maybe I should just extract now.

2212
01:25:01,830 --> 01:25:03,550
Maybe I should just leave.

2213
01:25:03,910 --> 01:25:04,910
Right now.

2214
01:25:05,250 --> 01:25:07,690
I'm tempted to actually just go.

2215
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:11,570
I don't feel safe with this team.

2216
01:25:13,110 --> 01:25:16,970
I think we're that team that's gonna get absolutely destroyed later.

2217
01:25:17,790 --> 01:25:18,030
Alright.

2218
01:25:18,410 --> 01:25:18,990
Let's go.

2219
01:25:19,790 --> 01:25:21,350
Give them a chance.

2220
01:25:21,690 --> 01:25:21,890
Guys.

2221
01:25:21,970 --> 01:25:23,150
I have such a cool gun.

2222
01:25:23,890 --> 01:25:24,410
Let's go.

2223
01:25:24,650 --> 01:25:25,170
I have...

2224
01:25:25,170 --> 01:25:26,690
I'm never gonna use again.

2225
01:25:27,650 --> 01:25:28,230
Alright.

2226
01:25:28,230 --> 01:25:29,490
Let's see.

2227
01:25:30,030 --> 01:25:30,550
Let's see.

2228
01:25:30,550 --> 01:25:31,570
Extraction so far.

2229
01:25:31,810 --> 01:25:33,030
Which is a little concerning.

2230
01:25:33,490 --> 01:25:38,290
I'm a little concerned now about my team after my guy died to an NPC.

2231
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:44,700
There we go.

2232
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:46,060
Wait, what?

2233
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:47,160
Oh shit!

2234
01:25:49,940 --> 01:25:50,540
Guys.

2235
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:51,420
Guys.

2236
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:52,140
Please.

2237
01:25:52,660 --> 01:25:53,460
Shoot him.

2238
01:25:53,660 --> 01:25:55,880
I cannot be the only one shooting him.

2239
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:56,480
I...

2240
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:00,080
I...

2241
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:00,880
I...

2242
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:03,060
I could not have been the only one shooting that guy.

2243
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:06,960
Please.

2244
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:08,940
I swear to God.

2245
01:26:09,260 --> 01:26:10,160
I'm not.

2246
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:11,100
I...

2247
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:14,140
I was...

2248
01:26:14,140 --> 01:26:15,980
I felt like I was the only one shooting him.

2249
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:19,560
I...

2250
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:20,720
Bro, Ian!

2251
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:21,480
Telly!

2252
01:26:21,700 --> 01:26:24,180
Did you not bring any heals on you?

2253
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:25,860
How much spirit do you have?

2254
01:26:29,620 --> 01:26:32,140
Oh my god, he has too much.

2255
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:38,660
Guys, I don't think he brought his... Oh my god, buddy!

2256
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:39,680
Buddy!

2257
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:43,580
How did you go outside?

2258
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:47,620
Get this shot, bye.

2259
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:52,720
Move!

2260
01:26:52,900 --> 01:26:53,940
You can move!

2261
01:26:54,340 --> 01:26:55,760
Why didn't you move?

2262
01:26:55,940 --> 01:26:56,300
Tell me!

2263
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:56,520
Get out of here!

2264
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:58,420
How did you get out for access?

2265
01:26:59,160 --> 01:26:59,680
How...

2266
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:05,360
You died of him?

2267
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:07,740
Buddy.

2268
01:27:09,820 --> 01:27:10,660
Buddy.

2269
01:27:15,580 --> 01:27:17,720
Oh my god.

2270
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:19,820
I'm going to the extraction.

2271
01:27:20,380 --> 01:27:24,260
I am not... I'm not... I don't trust any of my...

2272
01:27:24,260 --> 01:27:25,300
I'm leaving.

2273
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,960
I'm going to extraction, buddy.

2274
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:35,880
Oh, there's people fighting over there, though.

2275
01:27:36,220 --> 01:27:36,700
Let's go.

2276
01:27:37,060 --> 01:27:38,000
Let's go.

2277
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:44,740
Oh my god, the fuck is that?

2278
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:50,100
There we go.

2279
01:27:52,820 --> 01:27:54,040
Alright, we're going.

2280
01:27:54,740 --> 01:27:55,420
We're going.

2281
01:27:55,420 --> 01:27:57,060
You don't deserve loot after that.

2282
01:27:57,260 --> 01:27:57,460
We're leaving.

2283
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:00,820
Oh my god.

2284
01:28:01,180 --> 01:28:04,040
We'll grab loot on the way to go there.

2285
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:07,600
Oh...

2286
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:09,080
There's people fighting there.

2287
01:28:10,540 --> 01:28:12,780
There's real people over there.

2288
01:28:13,060 --> 01:28:13,720
I don't think...

2289
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:14,100
No!

2290
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:14,860
Do not...

2291
01:28:14,860 --> 01:28:15,480
Oh my god!

2292
01:28:15,620 --> 01:28:17,440
Do not signal the real people!

2293
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:20,100
Oh no.

2294
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:21,100
Oh no.

2295
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:22,520
Oh no, the real people know we're here, too.

2296
01:28:29,580 --> 01:28:30,300
There we go.

2297
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:32,820
That was actually, like...

2298
01:28:32,820 --> 01:28:33,620
A tanky guy.

2299
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:36,660
Let's see an increase.

2300
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:39,380
Oh, what the fuck?

2301
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:45,280
Okay, nice.

2302
01:28:46,540 --> 01:28:46,940
Alright.

2303
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:49,540
He's saying no real people that we're here.

2304
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:50,120
So, like...

2305
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:50,840
I'm a little sad.

2306
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:54,700
We need all that.

2307
01:28:54,940 --> 01:28:56,600
We need the shield, so...

2308
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:59,560
I'm a little sad and a little worried.

2309
01:28:59,700 --> 01:29:01,140
Because now real people know we're here.

2310
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:06,400
There we go.

2311
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:08,300
I'll get these guys out.

2312
01:29:09,380 --> 01:29:11,580
I don't trust my team no more.

2313
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:12,520
I...

2314
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:15,520
I don't trust...

2315
01:29:16,180 --> 01:29:18,080
I don't trust...

2316
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:21,460
There are more babies than me.

2317
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:26,540
Why is there so...

2318
01:29:26,540 --> 01:29:28,340
Why is it so far?

2319
01:29:30,020 --> 01:29:31,100
Oh no.

2320
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:34,160
Oh my god.

2321
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:38,140
Why is he extracted so far?

2322
01:29:39,740 --> 01:29:42,860
Look, after what I saw happen to Telly, I...

2323
01:29:42,860 --> 01:29:44,820
I can't trust anybody anymore.

2324
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:47,480
I live with zero trust.

2325
01:29:48,980 --> 01:29:50,720
Oh, there's people in front of me.

2326
01:29:51,860 --> 01:29:53,120
I hear them.

2327
01:30:01,030 --> 01:30:02,010
Oh my god.

2328
01:30:02,350 --> 01:30:04,550
Okay, popsicle liquor looks like...

2329
01:30:04,550 --> 01:30:05,810
He has more than just spirit.

2330
01:30:07,690 --> 01:30:09,490
So the way he is ADing...

2331
01:30:09,490 --> 01:30:10,550
I believe in him.

2332
01:30:11,730 --> 01:30:13,030
Telly, on the other hand...

2333
01:30:13,030 --> 01:30:13,640
Is a little special...

2334
01:30:17,570 --> 01:30:19,030
Is our special little guy.

2335
01:30:24,310 --> 01:30:27,390
I saw him strafing while he was aiming.

2336
01:30:28,070 --> 01:30:28,750
So like...

2337
01:30:28,750 --> 01:30:30,710
He's somebody I can believe in.

2338
01:30:31,690 --> 01:30:33,250
I'm like really...

2339
01:30:33,250 --> 01:30:34,830
Are you down again?

2340
01:30:36,750 --> 01:30:37,510
Buddy!

2341
01:30:37,910 --> 01:30:38,690
Oh no.

2342
01:30:39,150 --> 01:30:39,790
Oh no.

2343
01:30:40,350 --> 01:30:41,770
How are you down again?

2344
01:30:43,950 --> 01:30:45,610
Where are you down?

2345
01:30:47,830 --> 01:30:49,510
Oh wait, this is a real person.

2346
01:30:50,150 --> 01:30:51,350
This is actually a real person.

2347
01:30:51,870 --> 01:30:52,030
Actually.

2348
01:30:53,330 --> 01:30:53,650
Okay.

2349
01:30:57,310 --> 01:30:57,810
They're real.

2350
01:30:58,370 --> 01:30:59,030
So we have to be careful.

2351
01:30:59,170 --> 01:30:59,830
Because that was a cloak.

2352
01:31:03,330 --> 01:31:03,650
Okay.

2353
01:31:06,070 --> 01:31:07,290
I'm scanning from here.

2354
01:31:10,170 --> 01:31:10,910
There we go.

2355
01:31:13,470 --> 01:31:14,310
Is that real?

2356
01:31:14,490 --> 01:31:14,970
No, actually.

2357
01:31:15,210 --> 01:31:15,590
He was...

2358
01:31:15,590 --> 01:31:15,810
Oh no.

2359
01:31:15,890 --> 01:31:16,410
It was an AI.

2360
01:31:16,950 --> 01:31:17,270
I forgot.

2361
01:31:17,390 --> 01:31:18,290
AIs can cloak too.

2362
01:31:18,710 --> 01:31:19,150
Never mind.

2363
01:31:19,690 --> 01:31:19,970
JK.

2364
01:31:20,290 --> 01:31:20,870
He wasn't real.

2365
01:31:21,530 --> 01:31:21,970
Thank god.

2366
01:31:23,350 --> 01:31:24,130
Thank god.

2367
01:31:25,250 --> 01:31:26,590
He wasn't real, guys.

2368
01:31:26,590 --> 01:31:27,270
He was AI.

2369
01:31:29,110 --> 01:31:30,490
It freaked me out.

2370
01:31:30,630 --> 01:31:31,610
He started cloaking.

2371
01:31:32,490 --> 01:31:33,670
I wasn't ready.

2372
01:31:33,910 --> 01:31:34,150
Guys.

2373
01:31:34,370 --> 01:31:35,550
I wasn't ready when these...

2374
01:31:35,550 --> 01:31:36,610
We're leaving Telly.

2375
01:31:38,570 --> 01:31:40,150
He started cloaking.

2376
01:31:42,410 --> 01:31:43,590
It was wrong.

2377
01:31:45,650 --> 01:31:46,610
Oh my god.

2378
01:31:46,610 --> 01:31:47,730
I need like shields.

2379
01:31:48,910 --> 01:31:49,930
I want to...

2380
01:31:49,930 --> 01:31:50,970
I'm going to head to...

2381
01:31:53,470 --> 01:31:54,770
I'm heading to extraction.

2382
01:31:54,770 --> 01:31:55,430
I don't care.

2383
01:31:57,270 --> 01:31:58,670
We don't need loot anyway.

2384
01:32:00,230 --> 01:32:00,790
I...

2385
01:32:00,790 --> 01:32:01,750
Well, I need shields.

2386
01:32:01,930 --> 01:32:02,750
But like...

2387
01:32:02,750 --> 01:32:03,150
That's fine.

2388
01:32:04,790 --> 01:32:05,770
I need shields here.

2389
01:32:07,610 --> 01:32:08,950
I'll grab the credits.

2390
01:32:10,330 --> 01:32:10,690
Alright.

2391
01:32:10,990 --> 01:32:12,410
This guy can sort of...

2392
01:32:12,410 --> 01:32:13,290
Vaguely aim.

2393
01:32:13,530 --> 01:32:14,230
Which is good.

2394
01:32:16,730 --> 01:32:17,290
Alright.

2395
01:32:17,730 --> 01:32:18,150
Tokyo.

2396
01:32:18,370 --> 01:32:20,130
You do not miss Telly.

2397
01:32:20,270 --> 01:32:21,990
You don't even know this person.

2398
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:29,100
How do you miss somebody you don't even know?

2399
01:32:30,740 --> 01:32:31,220
Okay.

2400
01:32:31,340 --> 01:32:32,040
I don't have...

2401
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:34,520
The only issue is that I don't have my scan anymore.

2402
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:38,400
Okay.

2403
01:32:38,540 --> 01:32:39,340
I'll steal the money.

2404
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:39,680
Yoink.

2405
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:40,520
My money now.

2406
01:32:44,250 --> 01:32:45,010
Grab that.

2407
01:32:46,430 --> 01:32:47,850
I'll leave him the scraps.

2408
01:32:48,830 --> 01:32:50,690
It's his fault for being slow as fuck.

2409
01:32:51,370 --> 01:32:51,850
Okay.

2410
01:32:51,990 --> 01:32:53,230
We're not close.

2411
01:32:53,410 --> 01:32:55,570
But I like to believe we're almost there.

2412
01:32:58,010 --> 01:33:00,050
He was all of us.

2413
01:33:01,050 --> 01:33:02,270
If you were Telly...

2414
01:33:02,270 --> 01:33:03,050
Oh my god.

2415
01:33:03,330 --> 01:33:05,450
Like, if that's how you play...

2416
01:33:05,450 --> 01:33:08,350
You might need to give Alpha access to somebody else.

2417
01:33:09,510 --> 01:33:10,770
Can I climb up here?

2418
01:33:10,870 --> 01:33:11,490
No, I can't.

2419
01:33:12,010 --> 01:33:12,310
Alright.

2420
01:33:13,210 --> 01:33:13,410
Okay.

2421
01:33:13,410 --> 01:33:14,650
We have to go from this side.

2422
01:33:15,850 --> 01:33:17,810
It's like I'm still here.

2423
01:33:17,810 --> 01:33:18,470
Or...

2424
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:22,690
I'm like a little worried that like...

2425
01:33:22,690 --> 01:33:24,230
A team's gonna be like...

2426
01:33:24,230 --> 01:33:24,930
Ooga booga booga.

2427
01:33:25,990 --> 01:33:27,970
Like, that's what's worrying me right now.

2428
01:33:28,030 --> 01:33:30,130
How the fuck do I have to walk across this?

2429
01:33:30,750 --> 01:33:31,790
Oh my god.

2430
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:34,310
Alright.

2431
01:33:36,070 --> 01:33:36,630
My...

2432
01:33:36,630 --> 01:33:39,030
Guys, we all saw how Telly played.

2433
01:33:39,310 --> 01:33:40,930
Guys, we all saw it.

2434
01:33:41,770 --> 01:33:43,830
I need shields so badly.

2435
01:33:44,070 --> 01:33:44,670
I hate...

2436
01:33:44,670 --> 01:33:45,970
I hate stamina management.

2437
01:33:46,230 --> 01:33:47,350
I hate it so much.

2438
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:52,380
Oh my god.

2439
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:53,300
I don't like this.

2440
01:33:53,660 --> 01:33:55,480
I don't like the sound I'm hearing.

2441
01:33:57,460 --> 01:33:57,840
Okay.

2442
01:33:57,900 --> 01:33:58,300
Don't worry.

2443
01:33:58,620 --> 01:33:59,360
We're almost there.

2444
01:34:00,180 --> 01:34:00,900
Wait, is it protected?

2445
01:34:01,100 --> 01:34:01,620
No, it's not.

2446
01:34:01,740 --> 01:34:01,860
Okay.

2447
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:02,260
That's good.

2448
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:05,600
I miss my old crew.

2449
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:06,400
Guys.

2450
01:34:07,260 --> 01:34:07,780
Alright.

2451
01:34:08,420 --> 01:34:08,820
Alright.

2452
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:10,920
I miss them.

2453
01:34:13,060 --> 01:34:14,840
I miss them so much.

2454
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:16,300
They...

2455
01:34:17,020 --> 01:34:18,620
They stood on high ground.

2456
01:34:20,940 --> 01:34:21,480
I...

2457
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:23,160
I miss them so much.

2458
01:34:23,420 --> 01:34:25,500
They stood on high ground, guys.

2459
01:34:26,640 --> 01:34:28,920
That's already, like, such an upgrade.

2460
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:32,080
They know how to stand on high ground.

2461
01:34:37,820 --> 01:34:38,360
Alright.

2462
01:34:38,740 --> 01:34:39,760
I have access to this.

2463
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:40,840
Maybe I can open it.

2464
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:41,780
Nope.

2465
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:47,500
Oh my god.

2466
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:49,360
Alright.

2467
01:34:49,660 --> 01:34:50,580
We can do this, guys.

2468
01:34:52,060 --> 01:34:52,420
Alright.

2469
01:34:53,700 --> 01:34:54,040
Do it.

2470
01:34:57,640 --> 01:34:58,440
Do it.

2471
01:35:01,820 --> 01:35:02,420
Nice.

2472
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:08,880
There we go.

2473
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:10,420
We're five.

2474
01:35:11,460 --> 01:35:12,660
We're so safe.

2475
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:20,040
We're so safe, guys.

2476
01:35:21,860 --> 01:35:23,020
Where is...

2477
01:35:23,020 --> 01:35:24,040
Popsicle?

2478
01:35:24,540 --> 01:35:25,440
Oh, there he is.

2479
01:35:29,210 --> 01:35:29,850
Look at that.

2480
01:35:30,170 --> 01:35:31,710
I get to keep my stuff, too.

2481
01:35:32,830 --> 01:35:33,530
You know what?

2482
01:35:33,710 --> 01:35:34,930
I feel so confident.

2483
01:35:35,630 --> 01:35:36,590
I do this.

2484
01:35:38,930 --> 01:35:39,670
There we go.

2485
01:35:40,270 --> 01:35:40,610
See?

2486
01:35:40,670 --> 01:35:41,330
We're so safe.

2487
01:35:41,710 --> 01:35:43,430
We just gotta live for 30 more seconds.

2488
01:35:43,530 --> 01:35:43,690
Go!

2489
01:35:43,770 --> 01:35:44,550
Go get your loot!

2490
01:35:44,770 --> 01:35:46,310
I got all the stuff I need!

2491
01:35:47,250 --> 01:35:47,810
Oh, wait.

2492
01:35:47,830 --> 01:35:48,310
There he is.

2493
01:35:50,130 --> 01:35:50,770
There we go.

2494
01:35:50,910 --> 01:35:51,110
See?

2495
01:35:51,110 --> 01:35:52,850
Don't ever say I never helped.

2496
01:35:55,370 --> 01:35:55,730
Nice.

2497
01:35:57,070 --> 01:35:57,650
You know what?

2498
01:35:57,670 --> 01:35:58,350
I feel so safe.

2499
01:35:58,430 --> 01:35:59,150
I'm putting this down.

2500
01:36:00,090 --> 01:36:00,470
Oh, man.

2501
01:36:00,510 --> 01:36:01,930
It would be a shame if he dies right here.

2502
01:36:05,270 --> 01:36:07,630
Goodbye, popsicle liquor.

2503
01:36:08,610 --> 01:36:08,990
Goodbye.

2504
01:36:10,090 --> 01:36:11,630
If you die, you die.

2505
01:36:12,490 --> 01:36:12,930
Goodbye.

2506
01:36:13,410 --> 01:36:13,810
Goodbye.

2507
01:36:15,910 --> 01:36:19,150
I was not guiding anybody.

2508
01:36:19,430 --> 01:36:20,390
I

2509
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:32,300
got him!

2510
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:34,000
That's why...

2511
01:36:37,100 --> 01:36:39,060
Why did he leave?

2512
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:43,780
That was not my fault.

2513
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:46,840
He could have left with me.

2514
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:49,960
He could have stood.

2515
01:36:51,980 --> 01:36:54,180
How is that my fault?

2516
01:36:54,660 --> 01:36:56,600
He didn't go back.

2517
01:36:57,260 --> 01:37:00,580
He's getting lost.

2518
01:37:01,060 --> 01:37:04,660
He didn't go to the extraction point.

2519
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:06,600
I was literally waiting.

2520
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:09,840
He missed the telephone point.

2521
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,520
He'll make it, guys.

2522
01:37:15,100 --> 01:37:17,860
It would be funny if a team rolled up right now.

2523
01:37:18,940 --> 01:37:20,400
It would be very funny.

2524
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:23,060
It would be pure cinema if that happened.

2525
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:25,880
You know what?

2526
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:27,680
Three out of three.

2527
01:37:28,140 --> 01:37:28,980
I lived.

2528
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:30,520
Three out of three.

2529
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,260
Brian, thank you for the super chat.

2530
01:37:32,340 --> 01:37:32,560
Thank you.

2531
01:37:32,660 --> 01:37:32,980
Thank you.

2532
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:34,600
I'm going back to Hong Kong this weekend.

2533
01:37:34,700 --> 01:37:36,220
Gonna eat all the curry fish balls.

2534
01:37:36,220 --> 01:37:36,940
French toast.

2535
01:37:37,180 --> 01:37:38,760
Ball about egg tarts.

2536
01:37:39,080 --> 01:37:39,600
Egg waffles.

2537
01:37:39,780 --> 01:37:41,360
And cheap 7-Eleven Suma in your name.

2538
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:41,660
Thank you.

2539
01:37:41,740 --> 01:37:42,200
It was super chat.

2540
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:42,500
Thank you.

2541
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:42,840
Thank you.

2542
01:37:42,900 --> 01:37:43,840
We have a good time.

2543
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:44,280
Look.

2544
01:37:44,380 --> 01:37:44,540
See?

2545
01:37:44,780 --> 01:37:45,720
He got out.

2546
01:37:46,380 --> 01:37:47,920
He got out, guys.

2547
01:37:51,020 --> 01:37:52,240
We did it.

2548
01:37:52,360 --> 01:37:53,220
Let's go.

2549
01:37:54,340 --> 01:37:56,040
Tell me what I'm saying.

2550
01:37:58,340 --> 01:37:59,320
Look at that.

2551
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:02,940
We fucking did it, guys.

2552
01:38:03,720 --> 01:38:05,440
We're competent people.

2553
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:06,620
Look at that.

2554
01:38:07,480 --> 01:38:07,800
All right.

2555
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:08,160
See?

2556
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:10,160
We don't talk about what happened to Tully.

2557
01:38:10,340 --> 01:38:13,280
But me and Popsicle Liquor, we survived.

2558
01:38:14,980 --> 01:38:17,320
We fucking survived, guys.

2559
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:18,180
All right.

2560
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:18,460
Nice.

2561
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:20,100
Oh, I got to claim another thing.

2562
01:38:21,140 --> 01:38:21,900
Claim reward.

2563
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:24,280
Congratulations, runner.

2564
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:24,700
Yeah.

2565
01:38:26,540 --> 01:38:27,360
That's me.

2566
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:30,260
And have proven yourself fully functional.

2567
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:36,060
Two mega corporations have requested access to a partition of your neural interface.

2568
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:39,160
Your actions on Tazeti piqued their interest.

2569
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:42,000
The people who matter got out.

2570
01:38:42,340 --> 01:38:43,640
Guys, that's all that matters.

2571
01:38:44,260 --> 01:38:45,000
Yeah, we don't...

2572
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:45,520
Who's telling?

2573
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:47,860
Well, that's why they don't matter no more.

2574
01:38:48,100 --> 01:38:50,620
People are able to fulfill their priority contracts.

2575
01:38:50,820 --> 01:38:54,380
They may come to feel you can be relied on for more...

2576
01:38:54,660 --> 01:38:55,720
Yay, I'm reliable.

2577
01:38:55,720 --> 01:39:00,960
But most of these megacorps may align with yours or run counter to your motivations.

2578
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:04,080
You are free to engage with them as you see fit.

2579
01:39:05,320 --> 01:39:10,400
Cyber Acme will continue to provide you with support as we are invested in your success.

2580
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:13,260
You can rely on Cyber Acme to be...

2581
01:39:13,260 --> 01:39:14,240
He said I'm reliable.

2582
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:17,820
...the journey takes you across Tau Ceti and beyond.

2583
01:39:20,440 --> 01:39:21,320
All right, nice.

2584
01:39:23,140 --> 01:39:24,620
I do the lore for you guys.

2585
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:26,280
I know some of you guys are into the lore.

2586
01:39:26,420 --> 01:39:27,640
You have completed requirements to rank up.

2587
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:28,480
Oh, I ranked up!

2588
01:39:28,780 --> 01:39:29,120
Nice!

2589
01:39:30,440 --> 01:39:31,240
What do I get?

2590
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:34,340
Ranking up.

2591
01:39:34,820 --> 01:39:35,660
Why won't you let me claim?

2592
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:37,380
Oh, I have to press F.

2593
01:39:38,060 --> 01:39:40,000
Agents from reach out with employment offers.

2594
01:39:40,140 --> 01:39:43,480
Visit each faction to speak with their respective agents and accept it.

2595
01:39:43,480 --> 01:39:43,800
Okay.

2596
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:45,060
So, upgrades.

2597
01:39:45,220 --> 01:39:46,420
You have earned one rank...

2598
01:39:46,420 --> 01:39:47,160
Wait, what is this?

2599
01:39:47,560 --> 01:39:49,140
For a purchase with credits.

2600
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:50,760
Oh, I can buy...

2601
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:52,520
I can buy...

2602
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:53,720
Grenades now.

2603
01:39:53,740 --> 01:39:54,140
Nice.

2604
01:39:55,220 --> 01:39:56,240
And then...

2605
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:57,080
Now there's cores.

2606
01:39:57,440 --> 01:39:57,780
Oh!

2607
01:39:58,140 --> 01:39:59,420
Now you have to up...

2608
01:39:59,420 --> 01:39:59,760
Oh!

2609
01:39:59,900 --> 01:40:00,500
Okay.

2610
01:40:02,020 --> 01:40:03,460
Oh, that's interesting.

2611
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,480
You have to, like, upgrade your own backpack without...

2612
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:07,440
So, like...

2613
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:09,860
You have to loot...

2614
01:40:09,860 --> 01:40:13,460
You have to loot these items to get, like, a permanent upgrade.

2615
01:40:13,480 --> 01:40:14,180
And stuff.

2616
01:40:14,360 --> 01:40:14,520
Yeah.

2617
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:16,100
I get it.

2618
01:40:16,340 --> 01:40:17,540
Why did I get frag grenades?

2619
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:21,400
I should have got bag space.

2620
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:22,240
Okay.

2621
01:40:22,300 --> 01:40:23,500
So, you have to...

2622
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:23,600
Okay.

2623
01:40:23,660 --> 01:40:24,100
I'll show you guys.

2624
01:40:24,280 --> 01:40:25,920
You have to, like...

2625
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:27,960
Get specific loot.

2626
01:40:28,180 --> 01:40:32,320
So that you can, like, get permanent upgrades on your character.

2627
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:33,860
So, like, you know, there's, like, cores.

2628
01:40:34,340 --> 01:40:35,040
Standard cores.

2629
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:36,560
And there's, like, bag upgrades.

2630
01:40:36,580 --> 01:40:37,840
And then grenades.

2631
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:39,480
I can finally have grenades.

2632
01:40:40,980 --> 01:40:43,400
And then there's, like, gadgets.

2633
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:44,540
I don't know what the gadgets are.

2634
01:40:44,660 --> 01:40:46,060
But there's stuff like that.

2635
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:48,800
And I guess now that I...

2636
01:40:49,320 --> 01:40:49,840
Let's see.

2637
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:50,760
Earn a reputation.

2638
01:40:51,160 --> 01:40:52,060
Can I, like, work...

2639
01:40:52,060 --> 01:40:54,440
And then I can work for other agencies.

2640
01:40:55,060 --> 01:40:56,460
I'm a free agency now.

2641
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:57,220
I'm a free agent.

2642
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:02,880
Essentially everywhere.

2643
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:03,880
I am

2644
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:16,520
God's furnishings.

2645
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:17,660
I'm an independent runner.

2646
01:41:18,220 --> 01:41:20,320
I work for no corporations.

2647
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:22,360
I'm a free agent.

2648
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:23,800
We need to stick in the original colony.

2649
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:34,860
Mishkaloric exists to feed, clothe, and supply humanity with its most basic...

2650
01:41:34,860 --> 01:41:35,700
The lore...

2651
01:41:35,700 --> 01:41:39,040
The lore mystic is very interesting.

2652
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:42,500
Because it feels very dystopian.

2653
01:41:43,260 --> 01:41:45,800
I think that's the proper word to describe it.

2654
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:48,060
I feel like I'm in a dystopia right now.

2655
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:50,960
I'm an indie runner.

2656
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:51,340
Yeah.

2657
01:41:55,820 --> 01:41:56,260
Okay.

2658
01:41:56,680 --> 01:41:58,000
So I can work for...

2659
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,040
Oh, I can...

2660
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:00,920
Like, I can choose which company...

2661
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:02,520
Um...

2662
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:03,400
I want to work for.

2663
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:04,880
So there's Traxxus, too.

2664
01:42:07,020 --> 01:42:07,460
Where...

2665
01:42:07,460 --> 01:42:08,720
There's a lion in there.

2666
01:42:08,940 --> 01:42:10,320
Wait, I got to talk to a lion?

2667
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:11,360
Is this Aslan?

2668
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:13,540
Oh my god.

2669
01:42:13,700 --> 01:42:14,800
What the fuck?

2670
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:15,440
I don't...

2671
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:16,280
Oh, I don't like her.

2672
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:16,900
Oh my gosh.

2673
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:18,000
I...

2674
01:42:18,840 --> 01:42:20,140
I don't like her.

2675
01:42:20,660 --> 01:42:23,100
Oh, I feel so uncomfortable right now.

2676
01:42:23,420 --> 01:42:24,080
I am...

2677
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:26,080
I actually feel incredibly uncomfortable.

2678
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:27,480
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

2679
01:42:27,480 --> 01:42:34,320
Traxxus, author of the masterminds, is the interplanetary economic leader across every major industrial category.

2680
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:35,640
I...

2681
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:36,200
Oh my god.

2682
01:42:36,260 --> 01:42:37,100
This is uncannily...

2683
01:42:37,100 --> 01:42:39,540
This is actually uncanny valley right now.

2684
01:42:39,680 --> 01:42:41,220
I am so uncomfortable.

2685
01:42:41,220 --> 01:42:42,300
I am...

2686
01:42:43,720 --> 01:42:44,040
I am...

2687
01:42:44,040 --> 01:42:46,360
Applicants may not be considered Traxxus employees.

2688
01:42:47,180 --> 01:42:47,700
As non-corporate...

2689
01:42:47,700 --> 01:42:49,220
I am not okay.

2690
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:50,900
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

2691
01:42:50,900 --> 01:42:52,100
Ha ha ha ha ha.

2692
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:58,120
Yeah, she feels very uncanny valley.

2693
01:42:58,400 --> 01:42:59,160
Like, the way...

2694
01:42:59,160 --> 01:43:01,240
Oh, with the lion, too?

2695
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:02,480
Oh, I...

2696
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:03,420
Oh my god.

2697
01:43:04,220 --> 01:43:04,820
Ha ha ha ha.

2698
01:43:04,820 --> 01:43:06,140
I don't know how I feel about her.

2699
01:43:06,700 --> 01:43:07,400
Ha ha ha.

2700
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:08,140
All right.

2701
01:43:09,560 --> 01:43:11,260
I mean, the quester...

2702
01:43:11,260 --> 01:43:13,880
Download geological survey.

2703
01:43:15,020 --> 01:43:18,020
Yeah, it's very creepy for sure.

2704
01:43:19,700 --> 01:43:20,320
Uh...

2705
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,480
I feel like...

2706
01:43:22,970 --> 01:43:24,280
I sort of got every...

2707
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:25,580
I don't want to like...

2708
01:43:25,580 --> 01:43:27,020
I think like the other characters...

2709
01:43:27,020 --> 01:43:28,180
I think like Blackbird...

2710
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:30,200
I know I just...

2711
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:31,620
I use Locust and Blackbird.

2712
01:43:31,620 --> 01:43:33,380
But reading like...

2713
01:43:33,380 --> 01:43:34,240
The...

2714
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:35,120
Um...

2715
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:36,300
Reading like...

2716
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:37,400
The...

2717
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:40,660
The abilities for the other characters...

2718
01:43:40,660 --> 01:43:41,980
I feel like...

2719
01:43:41,980 --> 01:43:45,500
Blackbird is definitely the strongest in a team environment.

2720
01:43:45,980 --> 01:43:47,520
Like the fucking...

2721
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:49,200
Um...

2722
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:50,720
The fucking like...

2723
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:52,360
Tracker drone and...

2724
01:43:52,360 --> 01:43:53,460
The Echo Pulse...

2725
01:43:53,460 --> 01:43:54,540
Was so good for me.

2726
01:43:54,720 --> 01:43:56,280
For when I'm like in a team fight.

2727
01:43:56,920 --> 01:43:57,560
And...

2728
01:43:57,560 --> 01:43:58,180
Like this...

2729
01:43:58,180 --> 01:43:59,880
Blackbird was like really fun to play.

2730
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:00,840
But...

2731
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:01,600
Um...

2732
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:03,300
I know that all the people that kept dying...

2733
01:44:03,300 --> 01:44:04,120
Were on glitch.

2734
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:04,600
Yeah.

2735
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:07,560
Telly was on glitch.

2736
01:44:07,740 --> 01:44:08,160
And then...

2737
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:08,600
What was it?

2738
01:44:09,260 --> 01:44:09,780
The...

2739
01:44:09,780 --> 01:44:10,540
The...

2740
01:44:10,540 --> 01:44:10,980
The...

2741
01:44:10,980 --> 01:44:12,380
The first guy...

2742
01:44:12,380 --> 01:44:13,100
On our team...

2743
01:44:13,100 --> 01:44:13,620
Was Sol...

2744
01:44:13,620 --> 01:44:14,480
Solar or whatever.

2745
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:16,080
Um...

2746
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:16,380
That...

2747
01:44:16,380 --> 01:44:16,620
They...

2748
01:44:16,620 --> 01:44:17,420
They both died.

2749
01:44:17,580 --> 01:44:18,200
All I'm saying...

2750
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:19,460
They both died.

2751
01:44:20,140 --> 01:44:21,880
And was not with us...

2752
01:44:21,880 --> 01:44:22,220
In the...

2753
01:44:22,220 --> 01:44:23,500
In the extraction.

2754
01:44:23,900 --> 01:44:25,420
So that's all I'm saying.

2755
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:26,480
Every...

2756
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:27,280
All the characters...

2757
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:28,800
All the players that I had...

2758
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:29,720
The teammates that I had...

2759
01:44:29,720 --> 01:44:30,340
They were on glitch.

2760
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:31,440
Did not make it.

2761
01:44:32,680 --> 01:44:33,200
Um...

2762
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:33,920
And you know...

2763
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:35,560
What had a hundred percent...

2764
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:36,000
Uh...

2765
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:36,860
Extraction rate?

2766
01:44:37,140 --> 01:44:37,660
Blackbird.

2767
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:43,380
Locust is like...

2768
01:44:43,380 --> 01:44:44,180
Seems like a tank.

2769
01:44:44,340 --> 01:44:45,380
He's like a good tank player.

2770
01:44:45,980 --> 01:44:46,480
I've...

2771
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:48,420
I've seen one of their guys...

2772
01:44:48,420 --> 01:44:48,820
Use void.

2773
01:44:49,020 --> 01:44:49,440
But like...

2774
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:50,880
I wasn't very impressed...

2775
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:52,060
With the void thing.

2776
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:52,880
Uh...

2777
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:53,760
The void abilities...

2778
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:54,880
Because of the smoke screen.

2779
01:44:55,860 --> 01:44:56,380
Um...

2780
01:44:56,380 --> 01:44:56,760
And...

2781
01:44:56,760 --> 01:44:58,820
I didn't see any smoke screen abilities.

2782
01:44:58,820 --> 01:45:00,480
We saw one...

2783
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:02,320
One of our teammates...

2784
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:03,140
Um...

2785
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:04,580
On void.

2786
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:05,680
Um...

2787
01:45:05,680 --> 01:45:06,180
But yeah...

2788
01:45:06,180 --> 01:45:08,560
I think Blackbird was definitely my favorite character.

2789
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:09,460
Um...

2790
01:45:09,460 --> 01:45:10,280
Out of all of them.

2791
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:11,360
Um...

2792
01:45:11,360 --> 01:45:11,680
I mean...

2793
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:13,100
I did only use two characters...

2794
01:45:13,100 --> 01:45:15,200
But I saw a lot of teammates die on glitch.

2795
01:45:15,400 --> 01:45:16,840
So I know that she's shit.

2796
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:19,840
Um...

2797
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:22,000
Let's see...

2798
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:22,700
Yeah...

2799
01:45:22,700 --> 01:45:23,340
I think...

2800
01:45:23,340 --> 01:45:25,620
I have enough intel on this game.

2801
01:45:26,020 --> 01:45:27,040
Will I play this again?

2802
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:30,840
Most likely not.

2803
01:45:30,920 --> 01:45:33,000
I might try it out on release.

2804
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:34,840
I don't think I'll try the beta.

2805
01:45:35,260 --> 01:45:38,920
I don't think I'll try the beta for it.

2806
01:45:39,180 --> 01:45:42,240
But I might try the release of Marathon...

2807
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:43,780
To see what they change.

2808
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:45,000
But...

2809
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:46,380
Or I get paid to.

2810
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:47,240
Or I get sponsored.

2811
01:45:47,240 --> 01:45:50,360
So far, I'm not like incredibly impressed.

2812
01:45:50,360 --> 01:45:54,260
Only because it just feels like an extraction shooter to me.

2813
01:45:54,460 --> 01:45:56,800
I think the gunplay is really fun.

2814
01:45:57,680 --> 01:45:58,200
Um...

2815
01:45:58,200 --> 01:45:59,280
No, this was not sponsored.

2816
01:45:59,420 --> 01:46:00,560
I literally just got a...

2817
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:01,440
I got a free code.

2818
01:46:01,620 --> 01:46:02,600
So like...

2819
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:03,080
Um...

2820
01:46:03,080 --> 01:46:04,860
It wasn't sponsored or anything.

2821
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:06,800
They just sent me a code.

2822
01:46:06,980 --> 01:46:08,760
And they like invited...

2823
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:10,140
And I wanted to check it out.

2824
01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:11,500
I wanted to check it out.

2825
01:46:11,580 --> 01:46:13,540
And see how it feels like.

2826
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:16,740
I think maybe if I have people to play with...

2827
01:46:16,740 --> 01:46:18,680
It'd definitely be more fun.

2828
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:20,140
If I have like my...

2829
01:46:20,140 --> 01:46:21,400
If I'm playing with friends and stuff.

2830
01:46:21,540 --> 01:46:22,380
It could be more fun.

2831
01:46:22,420 --> 01:46:23,120
Because you're coordinated.

2832
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:25,280
But even going in with randoms.

2833
01:46:25,320 --> 01:46:27,820
It did not feel that difficult at all.

2834
01:46:28,780 --> 01:46:29,300
Um...

2835
01:46:29,300 --> 01:46:32,000
I was not happy with the stamina management.

2836
01:46:32,340 --> 01:46:33,220
Because it...

2837
01:46:33,220 --> 01:46:34,040
I feel like...

2838
01:46:34,040 --> 01:46:34,680
I guess like...

2839
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:35,760
Later on, you're gonna...

2840
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:37,620
You can get upgrades to have more stamina.

2841
01:46:38,220 --> 01:46:39,080
And stuff.

2842
01:46:40,640 --> 01:46:41,160
Um...

2843
01:46:41,160 --> 01:46:43,320
It feels like...

2844
01:46:43,320 --> 01:46:44,360
Um...

2845
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:45,300
There would be...

2846
01:46:45,300 --> 01:46:47,100
Stamina upgrades to manage.

2847
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:49,040
Uh...

2848
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:50,240
And...

2849
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:50,800
Uh...

2850
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:52,980
Other than that...

2851
01:46:52,980 --> 01:46:54,920
I do like the guns.

2852
01:46:55,240 --> 01:46:56,460
I really like the guns.

2853
01:46:56,860 --> 01:46:59,720
I'm not happy about the stamina management.

2854
01:47:00,620 --> 01:47:01,420
And...

2855
01:47:01,420 --> 01:47:02,140
Um...

2856
01:47:02,140 --> 01:47:03,620
At the moment...

2857
01:47:03,620 --> 01:47:06,320
We had one team fight with an actual...

2858
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:06,900
Players.

2859
01:47:06,900 --> 01:47:09,080
But they seemed really bad.

2860
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:13,040
Or...

2861
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:14,720
I think my teammates were also...

2862
01:47:14,720 --> 01:47:15,600
Really, really good.

2863
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:17,820
I think it helped a lot...

2864
01:47:17,820 --> 01:47:18,640
That I was like...

2865
01:47:18,640 --> 01:47:19,240
Bloodhound.

2866
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:19,720
I guess.

2867
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:20,380
Like Blackbird.

2868
01:47:20,620 --> 01:47:22,740
So I gave intel to the rest of my team.

2869
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:24,060
And then I sent out like...

2870
01:47:24,060 --> 01:47:25,060
An explosive bomb.

2871
01:47:25,260 --> 01:47:26,220
And we like...

2872
01:47:26,220 --> 01:47:27,060
Killed people instantly.

2873
01:47:27,260 --> 01:47:28,900
We literally instantly killed the team.

2874
01:47:29,240 --> 01:47:29,720
So...

2875
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:30,980
I feel like...

2876
01:47:32,120 --> 01:47:32,600
Uh...

2877
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:33,360
Um...

2878
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:34,220
I feel like...

2879
01:47:34,220 --> 01:47:35,960
The team fight we had was super easy.

2880
01:47:35,960 --> 01:47:37,840
Because I actually had a very good team...

2881
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:39,340
That I ran with Q into.

2882
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:41,000
Um...

2883
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:41,700
But...

2884
01:47:41,700 --> 01:47:44,440
I don't think I would like to play solo in this game.

2885
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:45,300
Because I feel like...

2886
01:47:45,300 --> 01:47:47,040
With the abilities in general...

2887
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:48,420
It might be actual hell.

2888
01:47:49,740 --> 01:47:50,180
Like...

2889
01:47:52,160 --> 01:47:52,600
So...

2890
01:47:52,600 --> 01:47:52,920
Yeah.

2891
01:47:53,020 --> 01:47:54,060
And the fact that, you know...

2892
01:47:54,060 --> 01:47:56,060
People are figuring out how to play this game.

2893
01:47:56,120 --> 01:47:57,280
It is in alpha right now.

2894
01:47:57,740 --> 01:47:58,180
Um...

2895
01:47:58,180 --> 01:47:59,440
So people are still...

2896
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,920
People are still trying to figure out this game.

2897
01:48:02,260 --> 01:48:04,740
And people haven't unlocked like all the tech yet.

2898
01:48:04,740 --> 01:48:05,780
So like...

2899
01:48:05,780 --> 01:48:07,920
Honestly, it's basically like...

2900
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:08,540
Who can...

2901
01:48:08,540 --> 01:48:10,240
Everyone is just out aiming the other.

2902
01:48:10,720 --> 01:48:11,180
So like...

2903
01:48:11,180 --> 01:48:11,960
Luckily...

2904
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:12,360
Like...

2905
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:13,800
I can sort of aim.

2906
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:15,040
So...

2907
01:48:15,040 --> 01:48:15,640
Um...

2908
01:48:15,640 --> 01:48:17,440
It wasn't that difficult to...

2909
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:19,440
Out aim the one team fight I had.

2910
01:48:19,860 --> 01:48:20,160
Uh...

2911
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:24,640
Um...

2912
01:48:24,640 --> 01:48:25,420
But...

2913
01:48:25,420 --> 01:48:25,680
Yeah.

2914
01:48:25,900 --> 01:48:26,100
Like...

2915
01:48:26,100 --> 01:48:27,160
Right now, it's just like...

2916
01:48:27,160 --> 01:48:28,620
Whoever uses their ability...

2917
01:48:28,620 --> 01:48:30,500
Whoever can out aim the other...

2918
01:48:30,500 --> 01:48:31,520
At the moment.

2919
01:48:32,140 --> 01:48:32,660
Um...

2920
01:48:32,660 --> 01:48:33,020
But yeah.

2921
01:48:33,140 --> 01:48:34,960
Maybe I'll try it out more off stream.

2922
01:48:35,180 --> 01:48:38,340
Maybe I'll actually give my friend codes to people...

2923
01:48:38,340 --> 01:48:39,320
Friend codes to people.

2924
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:40,360
And just try it out.

2925
01:48:40,660 --> 01:48:42,000
But so far...

2926
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:42,540
Um...

2927
01:48:42,540 --> 01:48:46,960
It just feels like every extraction shooter I have played so far.

2928
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:51,200
And I personally am not really an extraction shooter type of person.

2929
01:48:51,260 --> 01:48:52,960
Like I don't play Tarkov or anything.

2930
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:55,780
The gunplay feels like Destiny.

2931
01:48:56,500 --> 01:48:56,980
Um...

2932
01:48:56,980 --> 01:48:58,080
So the guns are really fun.

2933
01:48:58,200 --> 01:49:00,620
I know Bungie is really good at making guns.

2934
01:49:00,860 --> 01:49:02,580
So like making guns feel nice.

2935
01:49:02,780 --> 01:49:03,220
So...

2936
01:49:03,220 --> 01:49:04,520
I like the gunplay.

2937
01:49:04,740 --> 01:49:05,600
I was hitting shots.

2938
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:07,540
And that's a plus for me.

2939
01:49:08,200 --> 01:49:08,680
Um...

2940
01:49:08,680 --> 01:49:09,440
But it just...

2941
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:11,080
It's an extraction shooter.

2942
01:49:11,180 --> 01:49:12,680
If you really like Tarkov...

2943
01:49:12,680 --> 01:49:14,200
If you really like Tarkov...

2944
01:49:14,200 --> 01:49:15,980
If you really like extraction shooters...

2945
01:49:15,980 --> 01:49:18,260
But you don't like the gunplay of Tarkov...

2946
01:49:18,260 --> 01:49:20,720
And you like gunplay from Halo and Destiny...

2947
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:22,100
Then you might like this game.

2948
01:49:22,720 --> 01:49:26,560
But at the moment, I'm not a Tarkov person.

2949
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:34,800
So it just feels like an extraction shooter I've played many times in terms of other extraction shooters that I've played.

2950
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:37,100
But yeah, that's my honest opinion.

2951
01:49:39,700 --> 01:49:46,580
I think if I was an extraction... If I did like Tarkov, I might really like this game, I think.

2952
01:49:47,100 --> 01:49:49,880
Because I did enjoy using the abilities.

2953
01:49:49,880 --> 01:49:52,520
And I did enjoy using the abilities on Blackbird.

2954
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:54,140
And I did like the guns.

2955
01:49:54,340 --> 01:49:58,920
So I feel like if I was into extraction shooters, I'd like this game.

2956
01:50:00,260 --> 01:50:02,200
So yeah, that's my opinion.

2957
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:06,020
That's what I'll say about it.

2958
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:09,800
And I guess that's how... I think three runs was enough.

2959
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:12,640
Because it felt like if I do another run, it'd just be the same thing.

2960
01:50:12,780 --> 01:50:16,140
It'd just be me trying to grab loot and then trying to get out.

2961
01:50:16,700 --> 01:50:17,980
Because that's what it is.

2962
01:50:17,980 --> 01:50:22,360
I felt like it was just basically... I sort of got a gist of it after three runs.

2963
01:50:22,580 --> 01:50:28,900
I sort of got a gist of what the gameplay was about at that point.

2964
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:31,100
And I do have another stream later today.

2965
01:50:31,260 --> 01:50:34,660
So... So we'll call it here.

2966
01:50:34,900 --> 01:50:36,360
Thank you everybody for watching.

2967
01:50:36,500 --> 01:50:41,640
I hope you guys enjoyed checking out Marathon and seeing what the gameplay is like.

2968
01:50:42,420 --> 01:50:45,520
Um... I do have another stream in... I guess like four hours.

2969
01:50:45,780 --> 01:50:46,660
So I'm gonna call it here.

2970
01:50:46,940 --> 01:50:48,880
As always everybody... Stay hydrated.

2971
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:49,500
Pause check.

2972
01:50:49,780 --> 01:50:51,620
Get up and move around to get that blood flow.

2973
01:50:51,720 --> 01:50:53,520
And if you stay up for me... Head to bed.

2974
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:54,840
Because... You deserve it.

2975
01:50:54,920 --> 01:50:56,260
I'll see you guys later tonight.

2976
01:50:56,580 --> 01:50:58,220
Bye everybody... I need to make the waiting room by the way.

2977
01:50:58,380 --> 01:50:59,760
I did not make the waiting room yet.

2978
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:00,360
I was so tired.

2979
01:51:00,860 --> 01:51:02,740
Anyway, I'm gonna make the waiting room after the stream.

2980
01:51:02,820 --> 01:51:03,700
I'll see you guys later tonight.

2981
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:04,400
Bye everybody.

2982
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:05,160
Bye.

2983
01:51:05,540 --> 01:51:07,160
Wait, did I finish my... I don't even remember if I finished.

2984
01:51:07,240 --> 01:51:08,320
As always everybody... Stay hydrated.

2985
01:51:08,460 --> 01:51:08,740
Pause check.

2986
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:10,480
Get up and move around to get that blood flow.

2987
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:11,320
And use that for me.

2988
01:51:11,620 --> 01:51:13,560
Head to bed or say... Oh, I said it already.

2989
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:16,160
Head to bed or go watch the stream tonight with Min.

2990
01:51:16,360 --> 01:51:16,880
Bye, everyone.

2991
01:51:17,220 --> 01:51:17,560
Bye!
