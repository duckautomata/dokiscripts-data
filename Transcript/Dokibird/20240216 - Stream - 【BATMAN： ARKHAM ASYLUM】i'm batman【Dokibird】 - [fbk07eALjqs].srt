1
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,420
Hello

2
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,180
everybody!

3
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,240
Hello, we're gonna start off by... whoa Batman!

4
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,760
Okay this like pan up all the way.

5
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,940
Yeah let's just end it off on his pecs I guess.

6
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,660
Damn!

7
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,980
No face!

8
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,940
We're not here to look at Batman's face!

9
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,480
We know his real assets right there!

10
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,760
Whoa Batman!

11
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:21,280
Damn!

12
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,200
Oh my god!

13
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,220
Hello everybody!

14
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,420
Uh... yeah!

15
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,180
Surprise!

16
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,040
A Batman stream!

17
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,820
I just... you know... his eyes are... yeah his eyes are up here!

18
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,200
Yes!

19
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,240
If the game knows where it's supposed to end...

20
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,920
Then...

21
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,580
All I'm trying to do is like, you know, I'm trying to...

22
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:45,740
Whoa!

23
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,800
See, look at that!

24
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,460
Why is it never showing me his face?

25
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,600
But... yeah.

26
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,380
Anyway, as I was saying...

27
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,680
Surprise stream.

28
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,380
I really wanted to play Batman!

29
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,520
Yeah, like, I just... I just really wanted to play Batman.

30
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,600
We weren't able to earlier, so I was like...

31
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:07,840
Ah!

32
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,120
I don't want to be like, you know...

33
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,800
The only gaming streams we had was literally Apex.

34
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,960
I was like, I don't really want to have like...

35
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,260
Back-to-back Apex.

36
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,140
So, um...

37
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,700
Surprise... double stream.

38
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,680
We're gonna start off with Batman.

39
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,040
And then later on, transition over to Apex.

40
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,880
Cause I just thought it was... I don't know.

41
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,220
I thought it was a little weird...

42
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,400
To have like, back-to-back Apex.

43
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,340
For... I know like... I know you're like...

44
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,740
But Doki, it's all... you're all about Apex.

45
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,700
Guys, it's not just... I'm more...

46
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,200
I'm more than just Apex.

47
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,660
Oh my god, Sam!

48
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,240
Thank you for the 50 gifted chips!

49
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,300
Thank you, thank you!

50
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,060
Guys, just like Batman...

51
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,060
I'm more than just Apex.

52
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,340
Just like Batman!

53
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,400
There's more to me than just Pax, guys!

54
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,640
There's more to me than just Apex.

55
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,920
There's more!

56
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,520
And that is why we're playing Batman.

57
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,640
I'm a variety streamer.

58
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,220
Exactly.

59
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,660
Anyway, I've never played...

60
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,400
I've never played Batman before.

61
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,660
I've never played...

62
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,660
Okay, I've never played this type of Batman game before.

63
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,020
I've actually...

64
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,180
I remember the...

65
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:44,200
I remember my dad playing the Batman Arkham Asylum...

66
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,240
Like the Batman series from the Arkham Asylum series.

67
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,140
A long time ago.

68
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,980
Did you guys know this game is 10 years old?

69
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,160
Yes, I...

70
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:57,840
I know a lot of dragoons are gonna be incredibly old.

71
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,040
Feel very old right now.

72
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,380
But this game is like more than 14 years old now.

73
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,160
It is almost 14 years...

74
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,720
Oh no, it's not even almost.

75
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,360
It is 14 years old now.

76
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,600
And...

77
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,520
But yes, I remember 14 years ago...

78
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,280
I watched my dad play this game.

79
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,120
And I don't really remember much.

80
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,760
I know it's like voiced by Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy.

81
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,200
Who are like... sort of like the OG voice actors.

82
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,180
And like the voice actors for like Batman.

83
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,800
So it's gonna be very very exciting.

84
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,720
I've always loved DC comics.

85
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,240
And I've always loved DC characters.

86
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,100
I've always loved like...

87
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,060
Well, I don't really like Batman per se.

88
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,200
I like Joker as a character.

89
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,160
I think Batman...

90
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,120
I was just not like...

91
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,860
Like you know...

92
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,860
He's just Batman.

93
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,140
But honestly...

94
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,240
I liked Joker more than Batman.

95
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,120
Because I felt like Joker was much more of an interesting character.

96
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,300
Than he is.

97
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,640
He's just you know...

98
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,920
He's like a billionaire...

99
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,060
Depressed man.

100
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,600
Who just...

101
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,200
You know...

102
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,360
Number one rule.

103
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,140
We don't kill anybody.

104
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:15,860
But!

105
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,040
I'll beat you up so hard.

106
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:22,480
That you'll have to deal with like millions of dollars of hospital bills.

107
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,860
And at least...

108
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,880
Okay.

109
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,820
Not gonna lie.

110
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,160
His one rule being like...

111
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,260
I can't kill anybody.

112
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,560
But like...

113
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,240
I feel like it's much worse.

114
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,780
Being like ridden with like hospital debt.

115
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,700
Medical debt.

116
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,120
Versus like...

117
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,040
You know...

118
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:41,900
Like...

119
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,360
Honestly for him.

120
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,320
He doesn't care.

121
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,460
He's a fucking billionaire.

122
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,800
He doesn't have to live through medical debt.

123
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,740
But like medical bills.

124
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:50,620
But...

125
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,460
But an average criminal...

126
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,040
Dealing with crippling medical debt.

127
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,420
Is a lot worse than just being dead.

128
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,980
And I feel like...

129
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,800
That you know...

130
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,340
You can be like...

131
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,080
Wow Batman.

132
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,960
That's so kind of you.

133
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,740
To not kill them.

134
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:07,840
But I'm like...

135
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,580
At this point...

136
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,840
They might as well be dead.

137
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,600
Like...

138
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,180
He might as...

139
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,600
He owns the...

140
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,080
Wait!

141
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,440
You're right!

142
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,160
That's so fucked up Batman.

143
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:18,960
If you...

144
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,360
He owns the hospital?

145
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,160
That's pretty fucked up.

146
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,540
Oh my god.

147
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,300
This goes so deep.

148
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:28,840
Anyway.

149
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,280
Let's fucking play Batman.

150
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,460
Okay.

151
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:31,780
I'm gonna...

152
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,040
Okay.

153
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,620
I'll say...

154
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:32,980
Okay.

155
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,920
What is the difficulty?

156
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,060
We'll do norm...

157
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:35,900
I'm gonna do tough...

158
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,560
Oh my god.

159
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,220
No.

160
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,720
I don't wanna deal with bullet sponges.

161
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,760
There should only be a type I heard.

162
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,200
Expert.

163
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:42,640
Bro.

164
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,080
Okay.

165
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,820
This is not an FPS.

166
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:45,780
I can't...

167
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,480
This is not an FPS.

168
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:51,140
I don't wanna deal with bullet sponges right now.

169
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,460
Um...

170
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,500
This game isn't old.

171
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,460
The Xbox 360.

172
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,900
Oh my god.

173
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,760
I can't believe you're trying to bring up the Xbox right now.

174
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:05,980
Batman.

175
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:07,700
Okay.

176
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,500
I'm gonna say it.

177
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:14,180
A lot of like the DC heroes character wise, they're pretty bland.

178
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,840
Like not just...

179
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,060
Sorry.

180
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,920
Not just DC heroes.

181
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,600
Marvel and DC heroes.

182
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,160
Some of them are incredibly bland when it comes to like personality.

183
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,520
I feel like the villains are much more interesting.

184
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,660
Is this a Batman that uses guns?

185
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,300
There's a lot of them.

186
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,480
There's a lot of them.

187
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,200
Whoa!

188
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,240
I hope the volume's not too loud.

189
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,300
Sound check guy.

190
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,500
Help me.

191
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,840
Mark him.

192
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,480
There he is.

193
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,100
Oh!

194
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,700
I'm joking!

195
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,660
Oh, a little quiet?

196
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,140
On a quiet side?

197
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,640
Oh, don't worry.

198
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,100
As long as the intro comes out...

199
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:11,720
The intro is over.

200
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,960
Oh my god.

201
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:17,040
You know, the graphics didn't age quite well for something that was 14 years ago.

202
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,160
I think like, okay, hot take.

203
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:25,420
I think like a lot of the older games look a lot better than the newer games.

204
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:30,260
Because they were not pressured to like make games a lot.

205
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,880
Like they were not pressured to make games in time for the holidays.

206
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,180
Versus a lot of the more recent games coming out.

207
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,840
More camels!

208
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:54,400
It was before capitalism decided to take over the world.

209
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,960
Whoa!

210
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,640
Intensive treatment!

211
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,480
Warden... that's not true!

212
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,840
I can go with him.

213
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:22,880
I don't know... I feel like, Batman... you are a billionaire... I don't know, I feel this should be

214
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,940
The games were so much simpler when it came to settings.

215
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,560
This is it.

216
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,480
What the fuck?

217
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,020
That's it?

218
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,500
Those are all my settings?

219
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,180
Oh my god, those are all my settings.

220
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,520
Holy shit.

221
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,860
Okay, I did not expect my settings to be like...

222
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,660
Not that much.

223
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,280
Holy shit.

224
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,940
Yeah, I feel like there's a lot of like...

225
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,740
Uh...

226
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,820
Like funding wise...

227
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,640
It feels like...

228
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,580
I don't know.

229
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,680
It feels like Arkham Asylum.

230
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,020
Someone is taking too much of the funding from Arkham Asylum.

231
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,540
Oh my god.

232
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,180
Okay, turn down voices by like 40...

233
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,760
Turn down music by 40%.

234
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,340
And then...

235
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,560
And then 100% on the sound.

236
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,120
Okay, thank you soundcheck guy.

237
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,220
Just use your mod powers to tell me things.

238
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,200
Alright.

239
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,260
Alright.

240
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:39,880
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

241
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,060
That's crazy.

242
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,600
I didn't realize there was like...

243
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,780
These were all the settings.

244
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:48,140
I forgot games were a lot simpler back then.

245
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,480
There was like six things.

246
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:54,760
Whoa.

247
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,020
Okay.

248
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,060
Not gonna lie...

249
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,720
If we were gonna talk about budget cuts...

250
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,500
This would be one of the things I would cut.

251
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,460
I have every approval of that station here today.

252
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:08,900
So...

253
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,020
I hope it's a...

254
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:10,340
Oh, lord.

255
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,420
Do we really need a picture of you?

256
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:14,940
Like...

257
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,300
Curing him?

258
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,620
It's the fucking Joker.

259
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,760
It's been like...

260
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,500
60 plus years.

261
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,440
I don't think...

262
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,660
After 60 plus years that we will ever cure Joker.

263
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,040
Look at all this new security.

264
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,940
He's so happy.

265
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,980
The warden?

266
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,940
Hahaha.

267
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,540
Hahaha.

268
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,340
Alright, I was gonna say, I think you gotta have a better standards.

269
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,460
Do we really need this elevator?

270
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,660
Stairs would work.

271
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,960
That is such a small elevator.

272
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,380
Stairs would actually work.

273
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,100
Or like a ramp.

274
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,520
We could have had a ramp.

275
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,900
Oh my god, okay.

276
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:11,700
Batman, financial wise, this building is terrible financial wise.

277
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,700
He's on it!

278
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,840
That's what ramps are for!

279
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,560
That was like barely one meter.

280
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,540
Oh,

281
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,450
zoom.

282
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:34,450
What am I zooming in for?

283
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:35,290
Oh, him?

284
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:40,550
This actually, the graphics actually age so well.

285
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,290
It's called Tax Cuts.

286
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,450
I want weapons on him at all times.

287
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,290
Do not let him out of your sight.

288
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,730
There'll be time enough for you later, Cash.

289
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,950
Speak your time.

290
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,310
Tick tock, tick tock.

291
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,190
Is that a crocodile I hear?

292
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:01,870
Croc?

293
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,170
What's up, Doc?

294
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,270
Pencil me in for tomorrow, please.

295
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:05,710
We've always, always fought.

296
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,690
We've got a lot of catching up to do.

297
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:09,430
Where can I run?

298
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:10,290
Keep behind me.

299
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,270
Hello new patient.

300
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:13,190
Krafftink.

301
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,470
Yeah, everything age so well for a game that was fourteen years ago.

302
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,250
Do we really need this TV?

303
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:26,030
Okay, financial wise, like, do we really need all of this?

304
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:29,190
Do we really need a TV?

305
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:32,150
At 5, 10 steps away?

306
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:33,570
Warden!

307
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:40,210
What are the millions of dollars I fucking pledged for this asylum for?

308
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,170
Shut up!

309
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,690
No, catch you soon, boss!

310
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,930
Shut it and keep moving!

311
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,970
The state of the wiring!

312
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,450
This is so poorly run.

313
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,110
This is...

314
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:53,990
This is... This is... Oh, now there's stairs!

315
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,050
Just be quick!

316
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:02,130
I like how, like, now there's a use for stairs.

317
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:03,230
Satisfactory condition.

318
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:07,950
Looks like he suffered minor lacerations probably in the last two hours.

319
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:09,790
There seems to be...

320
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:10,190
There seems to be...

321
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:10,570
Whoa!

322
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,230
Need to take my temperature?

323
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,570
I'd be happy to drop my pants.

324
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,790
I mean, I did just capture him.

325
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:20,890
He's good.

326
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,650
But that sweater is like, minor lacerations.

327
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,830
But how's the sound now, Soundcheck guy?

328
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,970
He ran out...

329
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,050
Was that C-Blum?

330
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,630
Oh my god!

331
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,130
I love C-Blum.

332
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:34,390
He's like, he has the best IMO.

333
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,790
I think he is the best Starscream voice actor.

334
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,350
You heard the lady!

335
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:40,170
We got another one!

336
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,150
There's another Psycho on the way!

337
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:42,850
There's another Psycho?

338
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,170
You hear that, Joker?

339
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,330
You're not fucking special.

340
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,110
No?

341
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,090
Where the fuck is that?

342
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,630
Must have been one of the guards then.

343
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,050
Is that another elevator?

344
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:52,550
Crock-o-boy!

345
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,190
Is that you?

346
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,270
Where the fuck is that?

347
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,250
Wait, who the fuck is that?

348
00:16:59,090 --> 00:16:59,910
Is that Crock?

349
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,070
Get ready.

350
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,110
Where the fuck... Where's his guard?

351
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,550
What is he doing?

352
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:11,330
They let him in the elevator unsupervised?

353
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:16,230
Okay, Joker has like ten guards on him, but Crock has zero.

354
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:17,750
I don't know.

355
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,410
Priorities wise.

356
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:20,790
Killer Crock.

357
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:23,830
What's it doing?

358
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,170
Yeah, how did he get here?

359
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:28,610
I've got your scent, Batman.

360
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,910
Who the fuck put him in the elevator by himself?

361
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,170
Get that animal under control!

362
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:35,890
Oh shit!

363
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:37,530
I got two!

364
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:40,930
Toy collar won't stop me from killing you, Batman.

365
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,490
I'll rip you apart.

366
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,370
Eat your bones.

367
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,610
I like how... I...

368
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,870
Okay, okay, now he gets two guards.

369
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:56,090
Okay, the guy that's like, you know, not restrained gets two guards.

370
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:57,150
Okay.

371
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:01,990
I mean, would you be in an elevator with him?

372
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:02,870
I don't know.

373
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:05,090
I feel like it's very dangerous...

374
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:06,910
to like have a villain...

375
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:09,490
by himself on an elevator for that long.

376
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,050
Unsupervised in general.

377
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:15,450
I feel like that's like, in hindsight, that doesn't sound very smart.

378
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,590
The night is young, Bats.

379
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,050
I still have a trick or two up my sleeve.

380
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:29,310
I mean, don't you think it's a little bit funny how a fire at Blackgate caused hundreds of my crew to be moved here?

381
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,770
I thought I told you to stay quiet!

382
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:34,690
Yeah.

383
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:35,550
Oh, Frankie.

384
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:40,690
You really should learn to keep that fat mouth of yours shut.

385
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:41,510
You're such a mess.

386
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:44,190
Also, I really don't think you should antagonize Joker.

387
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,050
Tell me something.

388
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,190
You've never let me catch you this easily.

389
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,110
What are you really after?

390
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:50,610
Well, nothing much.

391
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:51,370
Hundreds dying in pain here.

392
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:52,490
Why a second elevator?

393
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:53,850
There's a lot of...

394
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,330
Why two TV screens?

395
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,490
You're asking about a second elevator?

396
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:04,190
But why are there two TV screens?

397
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:08,570
I think you should avoid the fact that the prisoners from Blackgate Prison...

398
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:09,550
I think...

399
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:12,450
Guys, there's a lot more questions to ask here.

400
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,190
Huh?

401
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,110
What's he doing?

402
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:16,650
Stay where you are.

403
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:18,350
Get a flashlight!

404
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,030
Get a light out of here!

405
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,970
Guys, maybe we shouldn't have two TV...

406
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:21,150
Wha...

407
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:26,670
I wasn't sure that you should be a step-bringer.

408
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:28,250
What?

409
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:31,410
Don't you trust me?

410
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,330
Of course not.

411
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:33,430
You're fucking Joker.

412
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:33,670
You're a fucking Joker.

413
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,030
You...

414
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:39,370
Batman literally was like, I've never caught you this easily before.

415
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,220
Oh, hey, look.

416
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,300
See more guards.

417
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:46,880
You're back.

418
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,500
You killed three of my crew when you busted out of here.

419
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,380
Okay, wait.

420
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,940
Let me bring up the overall sound first.

421
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:56,120
We gotta do justice to Mark Hamill.

422
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,240
Let me boost up the sound a little bit more.

423
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,060
Alright.

424
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,200
I hope this is better sound, guy.

425
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,980
The budget went to the TVs.

426
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,420
Oh.

427
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:12,700
Gordon?

428
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,460
Is this Commissioner Gordon?

429
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,340
Long night, Jim.

430
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,860
Joker invades City Hall and holds the mayor hostage.

431
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,920
Leaving it to me to juggle SWAT teams, the media, and you.

432
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,540
Yeah, it's been a hell of a night.

433
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,960
Hopefully the last one we'll ever have with him.

434
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,420
Harley?

435
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,440
Hold it there.

436
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,520
Sorry, Batman.

437
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,780
Arkham staff only.

438
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,840
I assure you, if anyone's qualified, it's me.

439
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,880
Listen, I appreciate the assistance, but he'll unsettle the more violent inmates.

440
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,780
I think he's talking about you, Bats.

441
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,940
Don't be a stranger.

442
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,040
You're always welcome here.

443
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,400
Well, to be fair, they are right.

444
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,240
I mean, I'm pretty sure Batman put all these criminals in the asylum.

445
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:54,820
You okay?

446
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,800
He surrendered almost without a fight.

447
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,160
I don't like it.

448
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,560
At least he's back where he belongs.

449
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:04,760
Yeah, I agree.

450
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,960
Yeah, for like, I don't know, the 50th time he's in the asylum.

451
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:16,980
I feel like Joker should be like one of the villains that should just be like, be in a prison just built for him.

452
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,460
Batman, there's a door!

453
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:36,770
Oh, fuck!

454
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,670
There's a door!

455
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:45,330
Batman, I set a trap and you sprang it gloriously!

456
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:49,150
Now let's get this party started.

457
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,310
Ladies and men.

458
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,110
Alright.

459
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:56,430
I apologize for this interruption to your regular inter- Easy.

460
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:59,050
Wait, are normal grunts in the asylum too?

461
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,690
I'm just gonna heal everyone in the room.

462
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:13,630
Okay, honestly, I don't know what the grunts were thinking if that was smart.

463
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:15,050
Alright, I know you were- No!

464
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,360
Not done!

465
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,880
I'm not satisfied!

466
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,200
Oh there you go, thanks!

467
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,780
I'm not satisfied, get over here!

468
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:37,180
Avoid damage by countering incoming- Who needs to counter when I could just beat up everybody?

469
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,540
There's no need to counter when they're all dead.

470
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,200
The bug staffer!

471
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,360
I feel like it's more like the bat staffer.

472
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:46,480
No.

473
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,000
Alright.

474
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:49,520
Nice.

475
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,560
I don't run.

476
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,420
No.

477
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:51,900
Oh.

478
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,060
Who?

479
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:56,980
Alright.

480
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:04,060
I honestly feel like the asylum should not have like regular guys in here.

481
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,760
Is there a way to run?

482
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:07,980
Batman, please!

483
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,860
Can you only fucking walk?

484
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,420
Oh, okay.

485
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,420
Apparently prowling is faster.

486
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:15,860
Okay.

487
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,000
Wait, I could have literally had the door!

488
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,500
What the fuck?

489
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,360
Did I smash the window?

490
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,660
They had keys!

491
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:26,360
Wait!

492
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,340
Oh, I can walk!

493
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,540
I can run as A!

494
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,720
Alright.

495
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,260
Oh, okay.

496
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,720
Sorry, I had to...

497
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,540
I had to like test that out for a sec.

498
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,120
What's the bio?

499
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,480
Police Commissioner James Gwinn.

500
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:54,500
A former warden dedicated his career to cleaning up the corruption in the Gotham City Police Department.

501
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:57,940
A goal he has come long towards accomplishing.

502
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:04,500
He has been equally tough on crime and in pursuit of making Gotham City safe for all his citizens.

503
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:13,060
Gordon has forged an uneasy alliance with Gotham's other top crime fighter, the mysterious vigilante known as Batman!

504
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,680
Oh shit.

505
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,940
Oh, there's the warden.

506
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,700
Wait, what are his facts?

507
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,060
Oh shit, I'm gonna dox him.

508
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,960
Um, James W.

509
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,560
Gordon!

510
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,300
White formerly?

511
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:27,600
Okay.

512
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,460
Oh, that's interesting.

513
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,860
Wait, what's the Joker's real name?

514
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,480
Unknown?!

515
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,980
What the fuck?

516
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:35,700
What's the point?

517
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,880
What about his medical records?

518
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,680
How is he gonna pay his medical bills?

519
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,580
Plague Gotham City.

520
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,900
He is currently campaigning to become the next mayor of Gotham.

521
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,900
Oh yeah, he definitely...

522
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,480
He's definitely money laundering.

523
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:05,460
Yeah, this guy definitely looks like a guy that money launders and bezels money.

524
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,200
Are they okay?

525
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,160
They can't be dead.

526
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,440
No one kills.

527
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,240
Oh, now they tell me how to run.

528
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,000
Nice.

529
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,020
Warning.

530
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,720
Security breach in level B3.

531
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,420
There's no security... I'm Batman!

532
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:25,600
Warning.

533
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,860
Security breach in level B4.

534
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,800
How can there be security breach if I'm Batman?

535
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,120
Warning.

536
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,960
Security breach in level B8.

537
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,320
Nice.

538
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:34,360
Alright.

539
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,480
Warning.

540
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:38,160
Security breach in level B1.

541
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,140
Where do I go?

542
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,120
Oh shit!

543
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,040
How are you still not dead?

544
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:42,640
Warning.

545
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,800
Security breach in level B6.

546
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,340
Goodbye.

547
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:46,740
Warning.

548
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,620
Security breach in level B4.

549
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,440
These guys have like zero armor.

550
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,740
They should not be like...

551
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,440
They should not take this long to beat up.

552
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,180
The Oracle!

553
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,520
He's running free in Arkham.

554
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:59,520
Do you need anything?

555
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,480
Is my dad still there?

556
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,240
Commissioner Gordon is safe.

557
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,240
Wait, then where's this way?

558
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,680
Okay.

559
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,280
Which way is the right way?

560
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,440
Alright, where's this?

561
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,440
This goes...

562
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,380
Pacification chamber.

563
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,140
Where does this go?

564
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:18,960
Contamination.

565
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,160
Oh shit.

566
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,200
Are you a good guy?

567
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,380
Hey Batman!

568
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:24,320
Over here!

569
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,060
Hello!

570
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:27,480
Eddie!

571
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,320
Why do you have a name?

572
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,080
I'm not supposed to humanize you.

573
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:31,800
You're just an NPC.

574
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,840
What happened?

575
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,340
Joker happened.

576
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,760
You're lucky to be alive.

577
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,440
He must have gone this way.

578
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,520
Door is jammed.

579
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,540
I'll try and get it open.

580
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,100
Oh yeah, I know.

581
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,780
I know she can't walk anymore.

582
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,960
Can you hear me?

583
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,800
I'm with Batman.

584
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,420
Hello?

585
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,680
Where are they?

586
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,120
Back down there.

587
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:52,960
Do you need help?

588
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:53,720
No.

589
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,120
I work better alone.

590
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:55,900
Yeah.

591
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,620
I work better alone.

592
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:01,000
And also the 500 adopted sons.

593
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,080
And two adopted daughters.

594
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,120
I always...

595
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,700
Okay, so if you guys don't know...

596
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,580
Okay, Robin is not the original Robin.

597
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,980
Dick is not the original Robin.

598
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,080
Dick is not the original Robin.

599
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,500
They like retconned and was like...

600
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,980
There was actually one more.

601
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,420
I forgot her name.

602
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,220
But she was...

603
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:24,440
There was a female Robin before Dick Robin.

604
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,280
And...

605
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,580
And...

606
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,680
So now...

607
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,340
Now there's two adopted daughters and 500 adopted sons.

608
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,700
He works alone.

609
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,320
Third?

610
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,260
There's three adopted daughters?

611
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,140
He's strapped in the chair.

612
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,580
Saz has totally lost it.

613
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:43,500
Wait here.

614
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,600
You can't.

615
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,560
He'll kill Mike if he sees anyone trying to get close.

616
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,560
He won't see me.

617
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:55,200
Anything that looks even a little bit like a bat...

618
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,440
And this guard dies.

619
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,280
Do you hear me?

620
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,500
We can just get another guard.

621
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,820
He doesn't have a name.

622
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,200
Look at the pig.

623
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,720
What happens if I just run up?

624
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:06,880
Okay.

625
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,060
Alright, that happens.

626
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:10,660
Okay.

627
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:11,620
Alright.

628
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,000
But he's nameless.

629
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,060
It doesn't matter.

630
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,400
He has no name.

631
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,460
Does it really matter?

632
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,280
What happens to him?

633
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,620
There's three?

634
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,300
Who the fuck is the third Robin?

635
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:29,720
Okay.

636
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,800
I guess I throw the batter at him?

637
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,440
That's what I do.

638
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,340
Alright.

639
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,440
Oh.

640
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,240
Okay.

641
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:39,700
Boop.

642
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,500
Oh.

643
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,020
Oh.

644
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:47,690
Wait.

645
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:48,390
Do I fail?

646
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:49,490
What?

647
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:49,850
No!

648
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,490
It's just one guy!

649
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:54,490
Who cares?

650
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,770
We don't even know his name!

651
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:57,550
We don't even know his name!

652
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:59,090
We can just pay him.

653
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,770
The hostage was killed.

654
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:03,250
We can just pay him.

655
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:04,550
I'm a billionaire!

656
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,930
I can just pay his family!

657
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,230
I can compensate his family!

658
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,170
I can compensate his family!

659
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:13,590
I can compensate his family!

660
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,190
What?

661
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:14,910
What?

662
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:17,030
Just one guy.

663
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,350
I'm a billionaire!

664
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,250
I can just...

665
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:24,570
I can just raise his family!

666
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,910
I can just raise his family!

667
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:29,730
He doesn't even have a name!

668
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:30,230
He doesn't even have a name!

669
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,290
Why should we care?

670
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:33,910
His name is literally guard!

671
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:34,730
His name is literally guard!

672
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,450
His name was Mike.

673
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:37,970
His name was Mike.

674
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:40,410
Okay.

675
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:43,350
Why the fuck are you focusing on names now?

676
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:46,950
I'm just filming on the ground, so I'll stay up high.

677
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:47,690
Yeah.

678
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,570
I have to use detective mode.

679
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:50,730
What's this?

680
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:52,090
Whoa!

681
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:52,570
Whoa!

682
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,110
Okay.

683
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:58,350
Look around for some important objects.

684
00:29:58,650 --> 00:29:58,750
Oh!

685
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:00,570
Can I...

686
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:02,250
do something about that?

687
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:07,230
These old gargoyles should be able to support my weight if I grapple up to them.

688
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:07,710
Okay.

689
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:11,550
Gargoyles provide a suitable vantage point from which to survey a room.

690
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:12,010
Okay.

691
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:13,250
Oh!

692
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:16,990
It's okay.

693
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,570
He's just getting zapped a little bit.

694
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:21,150
Glide cake.

695
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:23,390
To perform a glide cake by focusing on the camera.

696
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:24,510
Okay.

697
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:26,610
But what if he like zaps him a little bit more?

698
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:31,230
It's Mike from 20 years ago!

699
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:35,930
Give him a little bit of a zap.

700
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:41,840
Oh!

701
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:44,900
Oh!

702
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,540
Oh!

703
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,600
Shit!

704
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,540
Bro, I just made him a fucking vegetable!

705
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,820
But he's not dead!

706
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:56,760
He's...

707
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,040
He's not dead!

708
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,340
He's not dead!

709
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,180
Oh

710
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,200
shit!

711
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,640
It's the fucking embezzler!

712
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,420
Oh shit!

713
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:17,420
It's the fucking embezzler!

714
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:19,560
Old Sharp has never been happier!

715
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:19,920
Old Sharp has never been happier!

716
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:26,600
In case you ain't figured it out, today is the Joker's big homecoming and you're the guest of honor!

717
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,760
You have one chance to surrender, Quinn.

718
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,240
Tempting baths, but no dice.

719
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,040
Now the...

720
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,220
Technically the Joker's grooms shipped him from Blackgate.

721
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,720
But you get the idea!

722
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,500
Oh!

723
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,140
How is it you're gonna give me more updates?

724
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,720
Batman, you picking this up?

725
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,540
Harley Quinn.

726
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,620
This is Harleen Quinzel.

727
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:54,700
An Arkham Asylum psychiatrist assigned to treat the Joker.

728
00:31:54,700 --> 00:32:01,120
Dr. Harleen Quinzel instead became excessively fixated on her patient, believing herself to be in love with him.

729
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,020
She helped him escape confinement and took on her...

730
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:05,480
I can fix her!

731
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:10,260
And took on her own criminal identity as Harley Quinn.

732
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,920
Quinn is a violent and unpredictable felon who's only...

733
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:20,020
Not the fucking $500,000 TV's that we fucking funded for the asylum!

734
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,060
No!

735
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,600
Don't worry.

736
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,680
That's why we have four TV's per week.

737
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,040
Um...

738
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:30,680
Because cruel in nature distanced away makes her just another of his victims.

739
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,340
A very dangerous one.

740
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,980
I'm here.

741
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,260
Arkham Asylum just vanished off the network.

742
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,720
He's in control of the security system.

743
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,260
He's probably isolated it from the grid.

744
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,300
That's not all

745
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,410
one sets foot on Arkham Island.

746
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:49,870
How the fuck?

747
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,310
Now they figured out?

748
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,910
But the story will break anytime now.

749
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:56,350
Also, who the fuck wants to live in Gotham anymore?

750
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:58,370
How do you know?

751
00:32:58,990 --> 00:32:59,550
I know.

752
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:01,550
I swear to god.

753
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:05,230
I feel like Gotham City has like the cheapest properties.

754
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:06,910
Because like...

755
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:10,050
It feels so depressing to live in Gotham City.

756
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,270
At this point.

757
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:16,230
Like...

758
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,950
I don't know.

759
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,510
After like...

760
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:25,030
I feel like the average death rate in Gotham City is like at least like 500...

761
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:25,750
What the fuck?

762
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:26,310
I'm so fast.

763
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,410
Is like...

764
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:29,890
500 per day.

765
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:33,630
Where the fuck are they still?

766
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:34,590
Where the fuck are they still?

767
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,390
Where the fuck are they still?

768
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,690
At this point.

769
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:39,910
I just live where Superman lives.

770
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:40,670
At this point.

771
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:40,830
I just live where Superman lives.

772
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:41,670
Like...

773
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:43,870
At least he can kill.

774
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:48,090
I live in a city where superheroes actually kill.

775
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:50,530
Yeah!

776
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,530
That's like a no kill bullshit.

777
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:58,010
It's just Chicago.

778
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:03,270
I'll live wherever... I'll be like, do you kill?

779
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:04,510
Alright, nice.

780
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,380
Oh shit, are they dead?

781
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,660
Oh no, it's the laughing gas.

782
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:18,540
You can't afford Metropole!

783
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,640
Anyway, let's open it.

784
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:31,350
Alright, how do I do this?

785
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:33,250
Oh, grapple?

786
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:33,710
Where?

787
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:37,960
Whoops.

788
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,760
Sucks to be them, I guess.

789
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,660
What happens if they all... can they actually all die?

790
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,880
Just walk away!

791
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,400
Just stop looking!

792
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,080
Sir, look away!

793
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:12,880
Stop!

794
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,400
It's just drama!

795
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,240
You don't have to look!

796
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,000
Oh, they can?

797
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,040
Oh shit, I was looking too hard.

798
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,460
You can?

799
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,960
You're gonna let Steve die?

800
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,640
Who gives a fuck about Steve?

801
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,420
He doesn't even have a name!

802
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,220
He's literally guard!

803
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,420
Oh shit!

804
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:44,900
Oh shit!

805
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,560
Where the fuck do I get up here?

806
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,160
Batman's here!

807
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,960
Just hold on a little longer, Steve!

808
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,380
Oh shit, Steve!

809
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,140
I'm gonna fall!

810
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,120
Where's Steve?

811
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:53,080
I'm gonna fall!

812
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:53,540
Where's Steve?

813
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,660
Steve was trying to reach the vent controls and clear the room when the explosion happened.

814
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,980
Please, I care about Steve!

815
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,840
Alright, but how do I get the Riddler trophy?

816
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:05,220
Steve!

817
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,520
Steve, look, I'm sorry, but there is important matters.

818
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,900
Like, how do I get this trophy?

819
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,020
Okay, we gotta go downstairs.

820
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:18,980
But then there's laughing gas, so we gotta figure out how to not get laughing gas.

821
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,120
Look up.

822
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:21,460
Look!

823
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,980
I need to figure out the gas!

824
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:24,940
Oh, there's Steve!

825
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:25,960
There he is!

826
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,900
Trophy over Steve!

827
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:33,580
Yes, I've never been a completionist, but today's the day I change.

828
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,000
You're the worst Batman ever?

829
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:38,820
Look!

830
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,560
Batman has already been the worst Batman ever because he doesn't kill.

831
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,380
Okay...

832
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:52,460
If he killed Joker ten years ago, we would not be here.

833
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:58,640
So, no matter what I do, Batman is already the worst Batman he can be.

834
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,080
Yay...

835
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,840
Alright, cut over here.

836
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,800
Oh, God!

837
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:16,360
I don't kill, but I do get brain damage.

838
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,060
Clearly... Clearly, that's the best alternative.

839
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:25,580
Use to remove toxins... Okay, but how do I remove it?

840
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,400
Terminal use...

841
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,740
Oh, fuck!

842
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,260
Oh, fuck!

843
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:33,900
Oh, shit!

844
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,540
Okay... Sorry, I tripped.

845
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,280
I tripped.

846
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:42,980
Everything's okay.

847
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:43,520
I tripped.

848
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:43,940
Okay.

849
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,360
Um...

850
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,960
Smash glass to activate it.

851
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,240
Can I just smash it like this?

852
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:52,820
Nice.

853
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:00,460
Sorry.

854
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:00,960
Okay.

855
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,060
I tripped.

856
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,320
Yay!

857
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,300
I did it!

858
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,200
Casualty's not that bad.

859
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,000
Alright, now I can get the trophy.

860
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,380
I did it!

861
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,040
Yeah!

862
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:29,860
Look at that!

863
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,400
Sucks for all those other guys that died, but woo!

864
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,680
I did it!

865
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,400
Yeah!

866
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,880
Okay, how the fuck do I get the trophy?

867
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,360
It's somewhere here.

868
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:42,620
Ow.

869
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:44,380
Okay.

870
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,240
Where is this?

871
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,460
Where's the op switch?

872
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,380
Oh, there it is.

873
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,820
Can I just punch it?

874
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:50,700
No?

875
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:55,930
Where's the other guard?

876
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,290
Hey there!

877
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:04,050
Destroy the teeth?

878
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:04,510
Why?

879
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:05,950
What's the teeth do to you?

880
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:08,990
Can I destroy it actually?

881
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:10,170
Wait, I can!

882
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:11,990
Whoops.

883
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,370
How many batarangs do I have?

884
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:13,770
Unlimited?

885
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:15,890
Oh, wait.

886
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:16,350
What is that?

887
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,410
What is that?

888
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:19,150
Plus 50?

889
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:20,070
Is that my currency?

890
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:24,610
You need a gadget that you don't have yet?

891
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:25,970
I'm Batman!

892
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,470
What do you mean I don't have yet?

893
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:28,290
I have money!

894
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:32,090
I can fix all my problems with money!

895
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,360
Oh wait, there's another one.

896
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:39,660
Oh!

897
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,500
Did I get it?

898
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,540
Oh, I did.

899
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,360
Nice.

900
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:44,620
Okay.

901
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,320
I wish I knew that earlier.

902
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,000
Backseaters!

903
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,480
You could have told me this earlier!

904
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,360
It's in there.

905
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,660
Those are the batbucks.

906
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,220
Wait, what's this?

907
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,000
Oh, is that the laughing gas?

908
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:00,440
Okay.

909
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,000
Causing a slow and painful death.

910
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:02,800
Oops.

911
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,440
Haha.

912
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,520
What the fuck gave him pink cans?

913
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,840
Oh, bat teeth!

914
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:13,740
Oops.

915
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:14,800
Sorry.

916
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,560
Sorry.

917
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,940
Thank god they're unlimited.

918
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,480
My budget.

919
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,360
50 million on batarangs.

920
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,400
Alright, guys.

921
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,680
Someone help me budget this.

922
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:28,860
What the fuck?

923
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,700
Where did you come from?

924
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,980
I wish Batman has guns.

925
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,260
There you go.

926
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,560
He dead?

927
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,060
Oh, he is definitely dead.

928
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,820
Oh fuck, he is definitely dead.

929
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:48,330
Nice.

930
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:51,110
Gotham City is sometimes like New Jersey.

931
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:51,890
I...

932
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:52,490
Wait.

933
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:57,390
Any New Jersey people out there want a fucking vouch for that?

934
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:01,990
What the fuck gave Joker spray cans?

935
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:06,270
Oh, teeth.

936
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:08,890
No!

937
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:09,730
Teeth!

938
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:21,650
Oh, now I can't aim.

939
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:24,410
After 200 years.

940
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:28,370
Who's that?

941
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:32,010
What the fuck is that?

942
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:39,530
What the fuck is this guy?

943
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:47,620
Boom.

944
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,520
Boom.

945
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:49,480
Boom.

946
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,500
Double tap direction to evade.

947
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,680
Holy shit!

948
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,120
You can just throw people?

949
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:55,880
Ow!

950
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,320
Okay.

951
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:01,660
Evade.

952
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,360
Where the fuck...

953
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,400
What do I do?

954
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,980
What do I do?

955
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,160
Oh shit!

956
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:17,680
Okay.

957
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,320
Don't worry.

958
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,500
I have unlimited batarangs.

959
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,620
What is he gonna do?

960
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,680
Fucking punch me?

961
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,360
It's fine.

962
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,660
This is my gun now.

963
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,640
Use your fist.

964
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:35,360
Why use my fist when I can throw batarangs?

965
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:39,020
Oh shit!

966
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,880
How the fuck is my fist stronger than metal?

967
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,400
Like...

968
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:46,840
You're right.

969
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:47,700
Just call Superman.

970
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:51,380
Honestly, I feel like all my problems could just be fixed if I call Superman.

971
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,620
Like, I need to make sure... Like, pride and ego should not be...

972
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:57,260
Wait.

973
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:57,800
Was that it?

974
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,180
Oh, fuck.

975
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,140
Well, that was unexpected, wasn't it?

976
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:08,900
Well, well.

977
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,100
Note to self.

978
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,160
Need stronger test subjects.

979
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:16,240
Seeing as how I'm feeling generous, I'll give you this...

980
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,880
How is my fist stronger than fucking metal?

981
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,200
I dare you.

982
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:20,900
End this.

983
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:21,480
Pull the button.

984
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:21,480
I feel wonderful for all.

985
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:25,300
From sheer physics, my batarangs should be stronger.

986
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:28,360
Physics wa... That's a blade!

987
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:35,380
Oh, you're getting too predictable, Vance.

988
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,120
Well, I'd love to stay and chat, but I have a lot of work to do.

989
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:39,580
I'm gonna go to a party to organize...

990
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:40,400
Throw your batarangs!

991
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:41,620
I'm gonna get a bat from all the stars!

992
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:42,940
Batman, what are you doing?

993
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,320
He can't dodge five!

994
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,900
He got the money punch.

995
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,400
Batman is a Batr...

996
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,460
Yeah, this does not look natural.

997
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,720
Yeah, it's not natural.

998
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:05,360
Oh, shit.

999
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:05,660
Ow.

1000
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:06,700
I can upgrade!

1001
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,240
Alright, congratulations.

1002
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:10,500
You have unlocked a Wayne Tech upgrade.

1003
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:14,460
Uh, Batman ignores physics.

1004
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:15,740
Okay.

1005
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,680
It's like...

1006
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:19,220
Bat...

1007
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,520
Doki is backstab...

1008
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,980
Yes, because it's stupid!

1009
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,720
Why did he throw his batarangs?

1010
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:28,080
He could have ended it all!

1011
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:31,960
I don't know if he doesn't want to kill it and fucking throw it at his fucking leg or some shit!

1012
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,580
Like, it doesn't have to be lethal.

1013
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:39,240
Okay, fill the XP meter to upgrade the Bat-Soon.

1014
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,160
Gain enhanced skills.

1015
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:42,160
Yes, Wayne Tech.

1016
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:44,640
Alright.

1017
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,420
Wayne Tech...

1018
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:47,100
Oh, wait.

1019
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:47,820
That's the map.

1020
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:48,320
Oh my god!

1021
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:49,120
Thank god there's a map!

1022
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:49,820
I'm always...

1023
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,080
directionally challenged.

1024
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:52,340
Alright.

1025
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:53,620
What do we...

1026
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:55,960
Oh, it's just a linear upgrade.

1027
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:56,380
Oh, wait.

1028
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:56,580
No.

1029
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:57,360
No, there's not.

1030
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:57,900
Okay.

1031
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,600
Combo Batarang.

1032
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,920
Critical combo strikes.

1033
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,180
Alright, what do we...

1034
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:02,860
Backseaters!

1035
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:03,680
Rise up!

1036
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:05,180
What do we upgrade first?

1037
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,080
Backseaters!

1038
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,160
This is it!

1039
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:10,720
What do we upgrade first?

1040
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,480
This is your time to shine!

1041
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,500
There's so many stuff.

1042
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:18,660
Inverted takedown?

1043
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:19,700
The fuck is that?

1044
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,380
Remote control Batarang?

1045
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,720
Sorry, apparently fucking physics sucks in this game.

1046
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:27,420
That Batarang's mean nothing.

1047
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,580
Inverted takedown.

1048
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:30,900
Okay.

1049
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:35,160
Allows Batman to swoop down and grab a stainless as they pass under gargoyles and...

1050
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:35,820
and leave the... Oh!

1051
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,040
Wait, that's so cool.

1052
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,000
Okay.

1053
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,760
I can just like...

1054
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:40,840
be up top.

1055
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,300
And not have to worry.

1056
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:46,260
Alright.

1057
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:47,820
Nice.

1058
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,320
Alright, pick up the Riddler trophy.

1059
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,940
Is there anything else here?

1060
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:54,780
Detective mode.

1061
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,280
Anything else I'm missing?

1062
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,300
Who's this?

1063
00:45:58,580 --> 00:45:59,420
Is this Eddie?

1064
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:00,620
Eddie!

1065
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,200
Oh, god.

1066
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:01,480
Sorry.

1067
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:02,760
You don't matter, too.

1068
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,120
Wait, he literally has Eddie's eyes!

1069
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:06,120
...Jerry in here.

1070
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:07,640
Powered up the gate.

1071
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,700
Oh, Jerry has a name.

1072
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,280
Joker went through that door.

1073
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,760
What's on the other side?

1074
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,780
We call it extreme isolation.

1075
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,240
Only way in is via the transport system.

1076
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:20,800
I love how they gave Jerry a name, but not guard number 20.

1077
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:24,660
Alright.

1078
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:25,300
Nice.

1079
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:27,100
Thank you, guard.

1080
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:29,280
The main security loop is locked.

1081
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,360
Can I go back and grab the teeth?

1082
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:30,960
No!

1083
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:31,800
Joker.

1084
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,500
You were expecting maybe two fates.

1085
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,220
There's no escape, Joker.

1086
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,220
Silly bat!

1087
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:41,160
I don't want to escape them having way too much fun!

1088
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,300
I even have you here to give a smile on my face!

1089
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,020
Not for long.

1090
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:46,960
Really?

1091
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,160
We'll see.

1092
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,140
This is a very unhealthy relationship, Joker.

1093
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:55,800
Just in case you were planning to arrange a little insurance.

1094
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:56,380
What the fuck?

1095
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,000
Gordon!

1096
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:57,520
No!

1097
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,520
Officer Bowles.

1098
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,000
No!

1099
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,340
Officer Bowles is corrupt?

1100
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,700
Gordon, your whole job was to deal with corruption!

1101
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,900
If you try to follow me, he dies.

1102
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:15,920
Jesus Christ.

1103
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,560
Okay, Gordon's terrible at his job, too.

1104
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:28,440
Gordon, your one fucking job was to deal with corruption!

1105
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:30,540
How did this happen?

1106
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:35,700
I don't know.

1107
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:39,320
Alright, we gotta go locate an allies to hold themselves for evidence.

1108
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:39,720
Alright.

1109
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,900
I gotta look at that map a lot.

1110
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:42,640
Where's the teeth?

1111
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:43,960
Batman, what's happening?

1112
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:44,800
No, my XP!

1113
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:45,300
Joker's escaped.

1114
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:46,700
He sealed himself off.

1115
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:47,980
He's got your father.

1116
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:49,160
Dad.

1117
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,120
Don't worry, I'm getting him back.

1118
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:52,220
He's doing his best.

1119
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:55,160
At this point, I feel like we have to hire another commissioner.

1120
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,180
Joker will not win.

1121
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:57,400
I won't let him.

1122
00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:59,660
I'm starting where he was taken.

1123
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:02,640
Gord is not rich enough to be good at his job.

1124
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:09,120
If he was a good cop, he would not be stationed at Gotham City.

1125
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,960
If you think about it...

1126
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:18,780
If you think about it, he would have 100% been promoted outside of Gotham City.

1127
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,740
Wait, do I have enough to upgrade for anything else?

1128
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:22,540
No, I don't.

1129
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,880
He would have been stationed in Metropolis.

1130
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,400
How do you do it?

1131
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:37,420
Not gonna lie...

1132
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:42,560
Batman should never... I should not have the title of Great Detective with my track record.

1133
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:48,330
What

1134
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,700
the fuck is... How corrupt is this place?

1135
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,080
Batman!

1136
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,320
Just have better funding!

1137
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:00,660
You're literally a billionaire!

1138
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,940
Outsource... Outsource to Metropolis to get...

1139
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,160
Is that actually too hard to do?

1140
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,400
Just throw money at the problem!

1141
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:16,460
Outsource!

1142
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,000
Oh hey, the penguin!

1143
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:19,980
Iceberg lounge.

1144
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:22,360
Very hard.

1145
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:24,940
Two hostiles?

1146
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:25,840
Oh, they're over there.

1147
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:26,520
Okay.

1148
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:28,820
Three TVs.

1149
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:30,160
Wait, that's true!

1150
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:32,660
Why the fuck was there three TVs?!

1151
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,700
He can't outfund the embezzlement.

1152
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:36,920
He can't outfund the embezzlement.

1153
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:38,980
Shit, you're fucking right.

1154
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,100
This is a bigger issue than it should be.

1155
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:49,170
Oh, throw a bat instantly at end time.

1156
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:49,850
Use a quick throw?

1157
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:51,530
Wait, how do I use...

1158
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:54,970
Oh, okay, I just do that.

1159
00:49:56,690 --> 00:50:01,290
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1160
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:05,650
God, my fucking Batarangs are so weak!

1161
00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:09,050
Brain damage!

1162
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:09,970
Alright.

1163
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:11,630
Goodbye!

1164
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:15,550
There's a lot of issues.

1165
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:20,290
There is.

1166
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:23,110
This is a huge problem, Batman.

1167
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:25,550
This is a huge problem.

1168
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:29,830
This is a huge problem.

1169
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:31,450
Oracle, I'm at the holding cells.

1170
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:33,030
I'm setting up a crime scene.

1171
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:33,550
Oracle, I'm at the holding cells.

1172
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:33,550
I'm setting up a crime scene.

1173
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:34,230
So what's the plan?

1174
00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:36,430
Isolate something in that room unique to both?

1175
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:36,690
So what's the plan?

1176
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:36,690
Isolate something in that room unique to both?

1177
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:37,350
Exactly.

1178
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:41,270
In a crime scene use detective mode to search for evidence.

1179
00:50:41,590 --> 00:50:41,810
Okay.

1180
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:46,000
Evidence scanner.

1181
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,000
Am I scanning?

1182
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:47,680
Aborted?

1183
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:49,900
Okay, I'm scanning?

1184
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,120
Whaaaam?

1185
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,980
Why the fuck do I need a scan?

1186
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:56,960
I'm in the right place.

1187
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:57,880
Ow.

1188
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,640
Isolate something I can link to the guard that clubbed Gordon.

1189
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,780
Wait, where did he get clubbed?

1190
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,420
Oh, there you go!

1191
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:05,640
What the fuck is that?

1192
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,540
Let's see what the forensic scanner picks up.

1193
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:08,200
Alcohol?

1194
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,060
Gordon, were you drinking?

1195
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:14,180
Oracle, I've got a trail.

1196
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:15,020
That's great.

1197
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:15,860
You follow it.

1198
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,020
I'm grabbing...

1199
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,490
This is why you got fucking clubbed!

1200
00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:24,970
Hey, uh...

1201
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:27,150
Track Gordon moves by following Bulls...

1202
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:27,470
Oh, no.

1203
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:28,510
He was drinking.

1204
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:30,450
He had alcohol strength.

1205
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:31,110
I see.

1206
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:35,110
He's detected mo...

1207
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:35,770
Oh?

1208
00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:37,150
Anything else?

1209
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:37,270
Oh, I see.

1210
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:38,010
Disease?

1211
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:39,610
Who the fuck is that?

1212
00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:42,390
Use detective mode to follow...

1213
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:42,930
Wait, there's more?

1214
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:49,710
The whiskey trails?

1215
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:51,670
Where the fuck is the whiskey trails?

1216
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:55,250
I literally see one whiskey...

1217
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:56,210
Oh, there it is!

1218
00:51:57,870 --> 00:51:58,350
Ow.

1219
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:00,730
Okay, let's just fucking...

1220
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:01,870
Can I chop this?

1221
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:03,790
Boom.

1222
00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:04,550
No, I cannot.

1223
00:52:07,410 --> 00:52:08,570
Guys, give me a sec.

1224
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:09,070
I'm thinking.

1225
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:13,650
Break the window.

1226
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:14,870
The window's already broken.

1227
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:16,290
Can I jump out?

1228
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:16,550
No.

1229
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,260
Okay, now I can't jump out.

1230
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:24,160
Alright.

1231
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:26,500
No scanning?

1232
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:33,540
Let me cook.

1233
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:38,540
Don't worry, I'll figure this out.

1234
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:39,540
I'm the greatest detective.

1235
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,080
Don't worry.

1236
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:44,340
Like they said.

1237
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,080
I'm the fucking greatest detective.

1238
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:47,220
I'm the greatest detective out there.

1239
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:47,980
Oh!

1240
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:51,200
Alright, there's more alcohol.

1241
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,020
There we go.

1242
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:53,280
I'm figuring it out, guys.

1243
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,640
...staff with correct security clearance.

1244
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,760
Security levels are now at orange alpha.

1245
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,420
There's more here.

1246
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:01,520
...alpha.

1247
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:03,960
I'm following it.

1248
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:05,580
...alpha.

1249
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:06,940
Oh my god, Joker.

1250
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,080
He's a computer engineer too?

1251
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,020
He can hack things?

1252
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:12,400
Oh my god, he can do everything.

1253
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:14,860
Oh.

1254
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:15,760
Enemy?

1255
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,520
Are you a good guy?

1256
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:17,980
I can't see.

1257
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:18,800
I'm in detective mode.

1258
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:24,180
How did Joker get- Be quiet.

1259
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:25,120
What's going on?

1260
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,180
Jerry, is that you?

1261
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:29,540
Be quiet.

1262
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,640
I'm detectiving.

1263
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:31,820
Ah ah ah ah!

1264
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:32,820
B-man!

1265
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,480
Mr. J doesn't want you following us just yet.

1266
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,320
I missed teeth?

1267
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:39,940
No!

1268
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:43,140
Not the teeth!

1269
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:52,560
Oh, shit.

1270
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:00,510
Oh, shit.

1271
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:00,990
Oh, shit.

1272
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:01,930
I can fix her.

1273
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:03,330
I can fix her.

1274
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:04,150
I don't feel like my daddy.

1275
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:07,270
No way to follow us now.

1276
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:08,070
Where's the teeth?

1277
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:09,390
Oh, teeth!

1278
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:11,490
Give me a sec, Harley.

1279
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,740
Harley, I literally have grapple.

1280
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:19,540
...service in the elevator.

1281
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,280
If I want to follow them, I'll need to do this the old-fashioned way.

1282
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,960
Harley, I literally have grappling.

1283
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:30,340
Harley, I literally have grappling.

1284
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:30,880
Harley, I literally have grappling.

1285
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:33,780
How is that gonna stop me, Harley?

1286
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:34,260
How is that gonna stop me, Harley?

1287
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:34,580
How is that gonna stop me, Harley?

1288
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:35,960
Wait, wait.

1289
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,160
Where do stairs go?

1290
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,100
Wait, there's stairs?

1291
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:39,600
Harley, there's stairs!

1292
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:45,960
Oh my god, you have a name!

1293
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:46,440
Oh my god, you have a name!

1294
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:46,760
Henry Smith!

1295
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:49,680
Who else?

1296
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,760
I told them, he's a monster!

1297
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,260
It's Slug!

1298
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,040
I'm slower than them!

1299
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:58,800
Alright.

1300
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:00,820
Let's see.

1301
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:01,340
You know what?

1302
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:02,540
Let's try with grapple first.

1303
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,360
It's faster than stairs.

1304
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:08,200
I feel like that is a lot faster.

1305
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:09,220
Unless...

1306
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:09,820
Wait.

1307
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:12,520
Are you trying to tell me there's no more else to grapple?

1308
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:13,620
No!

1309
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:14,740
Then what's the point?

1310
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:15,680
What?

1311
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:19,040
Chimmy?

1312
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:19,460
Ooh.

1313
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:22,500
Alright.

1314
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:23,120
Can I...

1315
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:24,980
Go here?

1316
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:27,120
I know you can hear me.

1317
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,860
I've got a little something for you to listen to.

1318
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:30,860
What is it, Joker?

1319
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:32,300
Harley and Frank are...

1320
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:40,460
Let's have a listen, shall we?

1321
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:42,240
Hey Frank, where you been?

1322
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:44,580
Joker's got more men on the way.

1323
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,080
They're coming around the front of the asylum.

1324
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:47,700
Gotta stop them getting in quick!

1325
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:48,380
Get over there!

1326
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:49,460
Damn!

1327
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:51,100
Come on, everyone, cover the main entrance!

1328
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:52,000
Ooh!

1329
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:54,380
Hang on, help me, help me, help me!

1330
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:54,800
This is important.

1331
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:55,860
Oh!

1332
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,340
Frank, what are you doing?

1333
00:55:59,360 --> 00:55:59,440
Oh!

1334
00:55:59,440 --> 00:55:59,880
The corruption!

1335
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,080
Frank, what the hell?

1336
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:05,280
Quit!

1337
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:06,480
It's clear!

1338
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:07,640
Get your ass in here!

1339
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:10,580
You're some piece of work, Frankie!

1340
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:26,310
Wait, is Joker a c- No!

1341
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:28,250
Sounds like Frankie's looking out just fine.

1342
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:28,730
No!

1343
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:30,590
Oh, I'm alive!

1344
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:32,810
Okay, everything's fine.

1345
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:36,230
Yay!

1346
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:37,290
Yay!

1347
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:38,030
They're killing me!

1348
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:40,450
They're killing me!

1349
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:40,890
No!

1350
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:41,470
No!

1351
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:42,790
No!

1352
00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:46,310
Okay,

1353
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:50,990
let's see.

1354
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:54,550
Let's shoot me again, Joker.

1355
00:56:54,550 --> 00:56:55,330
Oh, my God.

1356
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:01,670
I'm gonna say...

1357
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:01,690
I'm gonna say...

1358
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:01,750
I'm gonna say...

1359
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:04,070
I'm gonna say...

1360
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:06,490
That's a little awkward.

1361
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:11,130
How the fuck do I get to the fucking...

1362
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:13,410
Riddler trophy?

1363
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:14,370
Does it really matter?

1364
00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:16,050
Okay, guys.

1365
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:20,150
Other than for achievements, what does the trophy get me?

1366
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:24,570
What does the trophy get me other than achievements?

1367
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:26,450
I need to know.

1368
00:57:33,390 --> 00:57:34,650
Just for unlocks?

1369
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:35,590
What does it unlock?

1370
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:36,510
Nothing.

1371
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:37,070
Okay.

1372
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:38,970
I'll never look at another trophy.

1373
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:39,470
Oh, XP?

1374
00:57:39,650 --> 00:57:40,130
Oh, fuck.

1375
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:41,170
Okay, I need XP, actually.

1376
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:42,710
Never mind.

1377
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:43,650
XP is nice.

1378
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:46,410
Run towards low walls or fences to climb them?

1379
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:47,590
Oh, like this?

1380
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:48,870
Nice.

1381
00:57:54,450 --> 00:57:54,970
Alright.

1382
00:57:56,650 --> 00:57:57,690
Let's see...

1383
00:57:58,710 --> 00:58:00,490
God, I'm so confused right now.

1384
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:02,390
There's too many entrances!

1385
00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:06,450
The feeling of accomplishment!

1386
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:11,590
Look, I'm already doing it for the achievements.

1387
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:12,330
I mean, I've already done it for the achievements.

1388
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:13,230
I'm already doing it for the XP, okay!

1389
00:58:13,330 --> 00:58:14,050
Is that not enough?

1390
00:58:17,810 --> 00:58:18,750
I don't know.

1391
00:58:18,810 --> 00:58:19,350
I'm going to go through.

1392
00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:21,030
There's so many areas to go to.

1393
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:28,410
Okay.

1394
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:31,950
Where the fuck do I go?

1395
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:35,290
Holly, why the fuck did you- I should have taken the stairs.

1396
00:58:35,830 --> 00:58:37,230
I should've taken the stairs!

1397
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:39,590
God...

1398
00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:43,670
God fucking damn it!

1399
00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:47,310
The stairs would have been easier.

1400
00:58:47,670 --> 00:58:48,910
The stairs would have been...

1401
00:58:48,930 --> 00:58:49,910
100% easier.

1402
00:58:50,170 --> 00:58:51,170
Where am I?

1403
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:52,350
Where?

1404
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:54,890
Oh shit!

1405
00:58:55,070 --> 00:58:55,930
What is this?

1406
00:58:56,130 --> 00:58:57,190
It's a fake wall!

1407
00:58:59,050 --> 00:59:00,730
That I can't do anything about!

1408
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:03,610
What the fuck?

1409
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:05,750
What?

1410
00:59:08,570 --> 00:59:09,770
How do I...

1411
00:59:11,870 --> 00:59:13,510
How do I destroy it?

1412
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:15,350
Structurally weak.

1413
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:19,270
If it's structurally weak, why would my fist destroy it?

1414
00:59:20,450 --> 00:59:21,830
Control... Oh, it's for later.

1415
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:23,310
God damn it, it's for later?

1416
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:25,210
God damn it.

1417
00:59:25,330 --> 00:59:25,670
Alright.

1418
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:28,030
Guess I won't have to go there yet.

1419
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:32,230
I don't have the upgrades, guys.

1420
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:33,270
I'm poor, apparently.

1421
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:36,050
Skate?

1422
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:38,190
Oh.

1423
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:39,710
I did it.

1424
00:59:45,170 --> 00:59:46,130
Might not...

1425
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:49,230
I did not do it.

1426
00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:51,970
I did not do it!

1427
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:55,730
Oh shit!

1428
00:59:55,910 --> 00:59:57,070
No, they're alive.

1429
00:59:57,530 --> 00:59:58,110
Okay.

1430
00:59:59,890 --> 01:00:01,070
What the fuck?

1431
01:00:02,470 --> 01:00:03,590
Where do I go?

1432
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:05,650
Shimmy?

1433
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:07,110
Wait, oh, shimmy!

1434
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:09,210
Oh my god, there's a shimmy!

1435
01:00:10,870 --> 01:00:11,690
I'm learning.

1436
01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:12,750
Guys, I'm getting better.

1437
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:17,310
Why didn't they appoint...

1438
01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:18,110
fucking...

1439
01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:20,350
supermen in Gotham City?

1440
01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:25,850
I feel like I'm just in the wrong city at this point.

1441
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:33,990
I feel like if the crime rate is like 80%, I think I'm doing...

1442
01:00:33,990 --> 01:00:36,470
I think my... I'm not doing a very good job.

1443
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:38,790
I don't think I was meant to be a superhero.

1444
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:44,890
Just think about it, guys.

1445
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:45,770
Warning.

1446
01:00:46,190 --> 01:00:48,550
Arkham Intensive Treatment is at code...

1447
01:00:48,550 --> 01:00:52,370
If the crime rate is still so fucking high, then what's the point?

1448
01:00:56,350 --> 01:00:57,010
Think!

1449
01:00:58,830 --> 01:01:02,170
Maybe he's actually not good at what he does.

1450
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:04,190
Warning.

1451
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:07,530
Arkham Intensive Treatment is under emergency lockdown.

1452
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:11,470
What's the joke if Harley is evil?

1453
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:12,210
Why?

1454
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:15,030
Because only evil people are high.

1455
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:20,350
Let's see...

1456
01:01:20,350 --> 01:01:22,150
Oh, there it is!

1457
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:24,130
Jesus Christ.

1458
01:01:24,450 --> 01:01:24,910
It's a gun.

1459
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:26,070
Woop!

1460
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:31,430
Alright, I got it.

1461
01:01:31,490 --> 01:01:32,170
I figured it out.

1462
01:01:33,470 --> 01:01:34,830
I'm slowly learning.

1463
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:41,510
Also, where the fuck is Robin?

1464
01:01:42,310 --> 01:01:44,130
Is this before I had kids?

1465
01:01:44,950 --> 01:01:45,710
What's this?

1466
01:01:47,190 --> 01:01:48,130
What is that?

1467
01:01:48,130 --> 01:01:50,530
Is this another thing I need to upgrade?

1468
01:01:52,350 --> 01:01:53,370
Hold and scan.

1469
01:01:54,650 --> 01:01:55,630
Oh!

1470
01:01:56,050 --> 01:01:57,570
Deciphered messages.

1471
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:00,910
Okay.

1472
01:02:01,570 --> 01:02:08,190
I need to steal more kids?

1473
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:08,950
True.

1474
01:02:09,130 --> 01:02:09,170
True.

1475
01:02:10,590 --> 01:02:11,750
True.

1476
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:17,090
True.

1477
01:02:24,910 --> 01:02:26,030
Oh shit!

1478
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:28,590
Alright, where is it?

1479
01:02:28,790 --> 01:02:29,990
Backseaters, it's your time.

1480
01:02:32,830 --> 01:02:33,390
Okay.

1481
01:02:34,790 --> 01:02:35,350
Hello.

1482
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:37,250
Alright.

1483
01:02:38,590 --> 01:02:40,430
Time to beat up goo number five.

1484
01:02:40,830 --> 01:02:41,370
Oh.

1485
01:02:44,850 --> 01:02:45,410
Alright.

1486
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:46,410
Hey, look.

1487
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:49,970
Billionaires are not supposed to be like good fighters.

1488
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:51,610
We just throw money at things.

1489
01:02:51,830 --> 01:02:52,450
Oh shit!

1490
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:53,870
Alright.

1491
01:02:55,870 --> 01:02:56,470
Goodbye.

1492
01:02:57,730 --> 01:02:59,110
Where's my gun update?

1493
01:03:05,270 --> 01:03:05,870
Nope.

1494
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:08,550
Tee.

1495
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:17,490
Alright, tee.

1496
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:24,590
Oh, vent.

1497
01:03:26,090 --> 01:03:28,810
There's like so many passageways around here.

1498
01:03:29,310 --> 01:03:30,850
I'm getting so confused.

1499
01:03:33,230 --> 01:03:34,150
There's a lot.

1500
01:03:36,370 --> 01:03:37,910
Okay, locked, locked.

1501
01:03:39,450 --> 01:03:40,510
Nice alcohol.

1502
01:03:41,770 --> 01:03:44,010
Alright, we have to go to the vent then.

1503
01:03:45,410 --> 01:03:48,230
Oh no, I feel like I'm gonna get more lost later.

1504
01:03:48,530 --> 01:03:50,010
I have a feeling.

1505
01:03:50,010 --> 01:03:50,610
Please.

1506
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:52,790
Woah, shit!

1507
01:03:53,370 --> 01:03:54,390
Wait, he has gun?

1508
01:03:54,850 --> 01:03:56,470
Alright, I don't have to.

1509
01:03:56,590 --> 01:03:57,330
Wait, who's that?

1510
01:03:58,030 --> 01:03:58,050
I don't want to.

1511
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:01,830
Okay, boss, there's no one getting past.

1512
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:03,010
Is that fair?

1513
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:04,910
You've got it.

1514
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:05,490
Anyone coming?

1515
01:04:05,530 --> 01:04:05,890
Batman!

1516
01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:09,570
Is it people are dying and you don't want to use a gun?

1517
01:04:11,830 --> 01:04:13,610
Okay, it should be a life for life.

1518
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:16,830
If they get to kill two people, I get to kill two people.

1519
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:18,510
Like, I feel like...

1520
01:04:18,510 --> 01:04:19,210
No, I can run.

1521
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:20,710
Oh shit, I cannot run!

1522
01:04:20,910 --> 01:04:22,250
I'm not faster than a bullet.

1523
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:32,810
Guys, I found out Batman's not faster than bullets.

1524
01:04:37,390 --> 01:04:40,170
It's great, they can't walk forward.

1525
01:04:45,870 --> 01:04:47,150
Oh, Fargoil.

1526
01:04:48,530 --> 01:04:49,170
Okay.

1527
01:04:49,170 --> 01:04:50,330
Let's see.

1528
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:51,410
Gargoyle.

1529
01:04:52,910 --> 01:04:53,430
Gargoyle.

1530
01:04:56,330 --> 01:04:56,850
Gargoyle.

1531
01:04:57,090 --> 01:04:57,210
Gargoyle.

1532
01:04:58,070 --> 01:04:58,590
Okay.

1533
01:05:00,350 --> 01:05:01,130
Tap down.

1534
01:05:01,450 --> 01:05:02,730
Drop down silently.

1535
01:05:02,990 --> 01:05:03,950
But what if I can kill?

1536
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:09,810
But I want to kill!

1537
01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:11,830
Okay, but like, what if I do this?

1538
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:13,630
Nice.

1539
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:15,410
What are you gonna do?

1540
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:16,330
Oh shit!

1541
01:05:17,070 --> 01:05:18,110
No, that's not silent!

1542
01:05:21,690 --> 01:05:23,930
Okay, but what if I do this?

1543
01:05:24,370 --> 01:05:25,110
Oh!

1544
01:05:25,490 --> 01:05:28,790
I don't think they like that.

1545
01:05:29,190 --> 01:05:31,490
I don't think...

1546
01:05:32,770 --> 01:05:33,530
Okay.

1547
01:05:33,890 --> 01:05:34,830
Wait, they're not...

1548
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:38,190
God damn it, my battery ran so fucking weak.

1549
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:39,490
No!

1550
01:05:40,130 --> 01:05:41,170
What the...

1551
01:05:42,410 --> 01:05:43,170
Okay.

1552
01:05:45,530 --> 01:05:46,290
Woooooo!

1553
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:51,800
What the hell?

1554
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:53,440
They will never know.

1555
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:58,080
But...

1556
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,020
They'll never know.

1557
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:06,520
Hey.

1558
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:12,760
I wonder where Batman is.

1559
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:17,700
Okay.

1560
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:18,280
Oh shit!

1561
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:18,600
Oh shit!

1562
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:19,040
Ahhhhh!

1563
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:22,460
Sorry.

1564
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:25,400
I got a little cocky there.

1565
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:26,940
I got a little cocky there.

1566
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:27,320
I got a little cocky there.

1567
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:29,240
Shhhhhh.

1568
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:31,100
Okay.

1569
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:34,520
That's a little stupid.

1570
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:36,480
I can't lie.

1571
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:37,080
I can't lie.

1572
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:40,680
That's a little fucking stupid.

1573
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:43,140
Wait, there's a person there.

1574
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:45,640
They'll never know.

1575
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:46,820
They'll never know.

1576
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:53,580
They'll never know.

1577
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:58,580
Yes, we need to set a trap!

1578
01:06:58,760 --> 01:06:58,760
Yes,

1579
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:02,200
we need to set a trap!

1580
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:06,460
I love surprises!

1581
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:14,040
I know I think they'll enjoy it too.

1582
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,060
I mean, they already have guns.

1583
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:18,120
Don't worry, they'll be fine.

1584
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:19,300
Developed by Wayne Tech.

1585
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:22,700
Are you considered hack-proof?

1586
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:23,580
Currently inactive.

1587
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:25,360
That's a fucking lie!

1588
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:28,380
The Joker literally hacked several things!

1589
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,400
What do you mean?

1590
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:32,340
Wayne Tech.

1591
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:34,440
Wayne Tech!

1592
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:35,240
You are not...

1593
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:36,800
I'm not a great billionaire.

1594
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:41,620
To be fair, I feel like...

1595
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:42,220
I like...

1596
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:45,660
As Bruce Wayne, I definitely outsource everything.

1597
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:51,420
There's no way I have enough time to run a fucking company if I'm a fucking billionaire.

1598
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:52,420
I'm out here doing all this.

1599
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:53,320
Alright.

1600
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:57,060
What do we need to upgrade?

1601
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,920
Welcome to corporate America.

1602
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:04,280
How many goddamn TV this asylum has?

1603
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:05,420
Look.

1604
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:06,700
Look.

1605
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:10,360
There's a lot of things wrong with Gotham City in general.

1606
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:13,580
Alright, guys.

1607
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:14,600
It's time!

1608
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:16,520
It's time, backseaters.

1609
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:19,120
Times two combo?

1610
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:19,940
Which one?

1611
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:21,560
Where is it?

1612
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:24,120
Critical strike?

1613
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:25,000
Where is that?

1614
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:29,980
What we've learned is that batterhands don't fucking work.

1615
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:31,840
What we've learned is that batterhands don't fucking work.

1616
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:32,420
Okay.

1617
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:34,200
Which one is the best one?

1618
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:36,600
Armor?

1619
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:39,100
Critical strikes?

1620
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:40,280
Wait, next to inverted?

1621
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:41,760
Oh, there we go.

1622
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:43,660
Wait, I don't have enough.

1623
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:44,940
How much is that?

1624
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:46,660
I'm broke?

1625
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:51,880
Sorry, guys.

1626
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:53,780
I don't have enough money apparently.

1627
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:00,580
How much XP are this?

1628
01:09:05,510 --> 01:09:06,430
There's no...

1629
01:09:06,430 --> 01:09:08,270
I have a thousand batbucks!

1630
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:10,430
A thousand dollars is...

1631
01:09:10,430 --> 01:09:13,230
Okay, what the fuck is the exchange rate of batbucks?

1632
01:09:14,610 --> 01:09:18,270
Apparently the batbucks exchange rate is pretty fucking poor right now.

1633
01:09:18,950 --> 01:09:21,640
Uncle Jay!

1634
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:22,480
Uncle Jay!

1635
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:27,260
Oh

1636
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:35,050
my dangerous, I don't even have a gun!

1637
01:09:39,230 --> 01:09:40,510
I don't even...

1638
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:41,970
Okay, I don't even kill.

1639
01:09:43,590 --> 01:09:46,450
I should not be dangerous at all if I can't even kill.

1640
01:09:47,610 --> 01:09:49,070
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

1641
01:09:50,970 --> 01:09:51,490
Oh.

1642
01:09:56,510 --> 01:09:59,490
I just slapped him once and that's good.

1643
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:01,570
But, let's see.

1644
01:10:01,990 --> 01:10:03,610
Oh, you guys are the best!

1645
01:10:06,710 --> 01:10:06,870
I'm a bat!

1646
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:07,550
Yeah.

1647
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:11,310
I'll give you orders and then sit in your nice, safe room while we fight Batman.

1648
01:10:12,430 --> 01:10:14,170
Alright, how do I kill this guy?

1649
01:10:14,390 --> 01:10:15,050
Inverted takedown!

1650
01:10:15,130 --> 01:10:15,570
There it is!

1651
01:10:16,270 --> 01:10:17,270
What are you doing?

1652
01:10:17,730 --> 01:10:18,210
Nice.

1653
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:25,030
Okay, not gonna lie, this can actually kill a person.

1654
01:10:25,290 --> 01:10:26,070
Not gonna lie.

1655
01:10:26,970 --> 01:10:28,230
Batman, you idiot!

1656
01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:29,890
If you...

1657
01:10:29,890 --> 01:10:34,810
If they leave hanging way too long, the blood will go all the way to the head!

1658
01:10:35,010 --> 01:10:36,330
And then he'll die!

1659
01:10:36,890 --> 01:10:37,150
Hey!

1660
01:10:38,430 --> 01:10:38,610
Batman!

1661
01:10:39,830 --> 01:10:40,690
Oh, shit!

1662
01:10:43,270 --> 01:10:45,730
It's just a slower death, Batman!

1663
01:10:48,450 --> 01:10:49,630
Don't you understand?

1664
01:10:52,150 --> 01:10:53,510
Oh, he doesn't look up.

1665
01:10:53,690 --> 01:10:55,030
Gamers don't look up.

1666
01:10:55,410 --> 01:10:57,050
No, no, it'll be fine.

1667
01:10:57,270 --> 01:10:57,870
Don't worry.

1668
01:11:01,170 --> 01:11:02,790
He doesn't look up, right?

1669
01:11:02,970 --> 01:11:03,670
Ooh, glad kick.

1670
01:11:05,670 --> 01:11:06,630
It's fine.

1671
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:07,970
It's Oski.

1672
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:11,750
Who's gonna let him down?

1673
01:11:11,950 --> 01:11:13,170
There's no guards here!

1674
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:20,740
Batman, he's gonna get up!

1675
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:21,900
His heart's gonna stop!

1676
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:22,400
Batman!

1677
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:28,700
Gravity killed him!

1678
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:29,860
Not Batman!

1679
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:34,280
That's true.

1680
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:35,740
It's not my fault.

1681
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:36,740
It's Gravity's fault.

1682
01:11:38,020 --> 01:11:39,260
Gamers don't look up.

1683
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:47,680
Oh, shit!

1684
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:48,800
Please!

1685
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:50,220
I'm still beating someone up!

1686
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:50,460
Please!

1687
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:51,680
No!

1688
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:56,460
Okay.

1689
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,280
That was a mistake.

1690
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:00,860
That's a sleeping.

1691
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:03,180
Someone finish him off.

1692
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:04,560
No, Joker!

1693
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:06,240
You can't finish me off!

1694
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:07,820
Okay, wait.

1695
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:08,460
Freezing.

1696
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:08,820
Sorry.

1697
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:10,920
Wait, where am I?

1698
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:13,220
Where the fuck am I?

1699
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:16,660
Where am I?

1700
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:20,200
Where is this place?

1701
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:26,180
I don't know where I am.

1702
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:28,840
Oh, it's this one!

1703
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:30,220
That dude is all over again!

1704
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:31,140
Are you fucking...

1705
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:32,360
Okay, I have to listen to him.

1706
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:36,960
It's fine.

1707
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:38,620
There's no way he'll...

1708
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:38,800
Oh, it's this one!

1709
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:39,220
I can hear this.

1710
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:41,060
It's fine.

1711
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:41,820
He doesn't hear this.

1712
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:42,460
Don't worry.

1713
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:44,740
They learned how to look up in the third...

1714
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:47,180
Wait, you mean they actually learned?

1715
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:48,800
What a matter this misery.

1716
01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:50,840
It's the only reliable cure.

1717
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:54,360
To be fair, I think that is what Joker wants though.

1718
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:56,880
How the fuck he does his stuff.

1719
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:58,480
How the fuck he does his stuff.

1720
01:12:58,480 --> 01:12:59,400
How the fuck he does his stuff.

1721
01:12:59,980 --> 01:13:01,620
I'm just glad I kicked this guy.

1722
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:04,080
I'm just glad I kicked this guy.

1723
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:04,500
Whoop!

1724
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:06,240
Get over here.

1725
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:07,620
I really am.

1726
01:13:12,570 --> 01:13:12,570
Oh!

1727
01:13:12,810 --> 01:13:13,370
No!

1728
01:13:13,550 --> 01:13:14,110
No!

1729
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:15,430
Stop!

1730
01:13:16,330 --> 01:13:19,690
Is he still shooting?

1731
01:13:22,850 --> 01:13:24,970
I thought they don't look up!

1732
01:13:26,010 --> 01:13:27,190
Wait, where did he go?

1733
01:13:29,290 --> 01:13:30,050
Where is he?

1734
01:13:30,730 --> 01:13:31,930
He was a glad kick.

1735
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:40,970
How the fuck do they have guns now?

1736
01:13:41,230 --> 01:13:42,410
Things were so easy.

1737
01:13:44,130 --> 01:13:45,370
I didn't think it was gonna be that easy.

1738
01:13:45,490 --> 01:13:45,750
Yeah.

1739
01:13:45,990 --> 01:13:48,910
I sent a few more of my boys your way.

1740
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:51,230
Let's see how you deal with these.

1741
01:13:52,110 --> 01:13:53,710
Alright, where are the other ones?

1742
01:13:56,170 --> 01:13:57,510
Joker wants him found.

1743
01:13:57,730 --> 01:13:58,350
Spread out!

1744
01:14:00,530 --> 01:14:01,630
He could be anywhere.

1745
01:14:02,950 --> 01:14:04,210
Then keep your eyes open.

1746
01:14:04,210 --> 01:14:05,530
Is this supposed to be a stealth section?

1747
01:14:05,950 --> 01:14:07,530
No, we don't stealth here.

1748
01:14:07,630 --> 01:14:10,230
If we learn how Doki plays.

1749
01:14:10,670 --> 01:14:11,450
There's no...

1750
01:14:11,450 --> 01:14:12,870
Wait, why am I not on the gargoyle?

1751
01:14:13,230 --> 01:14:13,930
I'm not on the gargoyle.

1752
01:14:14,130 --> 01:14:16,230
There's no such thing as stealth.

1753
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:21,050
Alright, let's see.

1754
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:24,230
They won't know I'm up here, right?

1755
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:26,910
Okay, get over here.

1756
01:14:27,410 --> 01:14:28,450
Get over here.

1757
01:14:28,890 --> 01:14:29,650
Come on.

1758
01:14:30,530 --> 01:14:31,610
Walk over here.

1759
01:14:32,430 --> 01:14:33,790
Gravity will kill you.

1760
01:14:34,330 --> 01:14:35,130
Come on!

1761
01:14:36,470 --> 01:14:37,250
Come on!

1762
01:14:39,310 --> 01:14:41,110
It won't be so bad.

1763
01:14:42,170 --> 01:14:42,950
That's right.

1764
01:14:44,130 --> 01:14:44,730
No, no, no.

1765
01:14:44,970 --> 01:14:45,590
Come on.

1766
01:14:46,210 --> 01:14:47,350
Right here.

1767
01:14:49,770 --> 01:14:50,370
Ah!

1768
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:57,310
Just a little to the left.

1769
01:14:57,870 --> 01:14:58,470
Ah!

1770
01:14:59,170 --> 01:15:00,290
You're almost there.

1771
01:15:00,570 --> 01:15:02,790
You're almost there.

1772
01:15:03,110 --> 01:15:04,590
Are you okay?

1773
01:15:08,710 --> 01:15:09,310
Alright.

1774
01:15:10,430 --> 01:15:12,310
He doesn't want to...

1775
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:14,110
I don't think he wants to...

1776
01:15:14,650 --> 01:15:15,750
Alright, don't worry.

1777
01:15:15,870 --> 01:15:17,550
I got this one over here.

1778
01:15:17,950 --> 01:15:18,430
Alright.

1779
01:15:19,010 --> 01:15:19,610
Come on.

1780
01:15:19,830 --> 01:15:20,990
A little to the right.

1781
01:15:22,110 --> 01:15:23,890
You know you want to...

1782
01:15:24,470 --> 01:15:27,070
You know you want to...

1783
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:29,930
Throw a bat around...

1784
01:15:29,930 --> 01:15:32,150
I'm not gonna throw a bat around.

1785
01:15:34,670 --> 01:15:35,830
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1786
01:15:36,390 --> 01:15:37,030
Here, here.

1787
01:15:37,330 --> 01:15:38,130
Come on.

1788
01:15:39,150 --> 01:15:40,050
You have to...

1789
01:15:40,050 --> 01:15:40,470
Oh, nice.

1790
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:40,850
Alright.

1791
01:15:40,930 --> 01:15:41,170
Nice.

1792
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:42,690
I told you eventually.

1793
01:15:44,270 --> 01:15:45,350
Eventually it'd work.

1794
01:15:46,290 --> 01:15:47,050
What is he gonna do?

1795
01:15:47,090 --> 01:15:47,550
Look up?

1796
01:15:50,030 --> 01:15:51,850
Or do I just walk over to the other side?

1797
01:15:53,010 --> 01:15:54,010
What are we gonna do?

1798
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:55,050
Yeah, what are we gonna do?

1799
01:15:55,150 --> 01:15:55,910
What is he gonna do?

1800
01:15:56,770 --> 01:15:57,990
Wait, can they cut it down?

1801
01:15:58,370 --> 01:15:59,450
Just shoot the rope.

1802
01:15:59,770 --> 01:16:01,370
We'll come back when the bat is dead.

1803
01:16:01,650 --> 01:16:03,470
We'll come back, okay.

1804
01:16:04,650 --> 01:16:05,530
Shoot the rope.

1805
01:16:11,390 --> 01:16:12,630
Just shoot the rope.

1806
01:16:12,950 --> 01:16:13,910
Alright, nice.

1807
01:16:13,910 --> 01:16:14,850
Now he's gonna walk to me.

1808
01:16:17,670 --> 01:16:19,410
Oh, I can cut the rope?

1809
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:25,160
Oh my god, this changes everything.

1810
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:27,100
Okay.

1811
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:31,000
Oh my god, he's paranoid.

1812
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:35,100
Nice.

1813
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:35,420
Alright.

1814
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:35,900
Goodbye.

1815
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:40,620
Brain damage.

1816
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:41,480
Oh no.

1817
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:42,640
That's his dick.

1818
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:43,200
Okay.

1819
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:45,360
That's a little bit worse.

1820
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:49,640
Oh, interview.

1821
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:51,480
Call me Harley.

1822
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:52,640
Everyone does.

1823
01:16:53,580 --> 01:16:55,100
Thank you for the super chat.

1824
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:57,340
Congrats on 550k subscribers.

1825
01:16:57,720 --> 01:16:58,100
Thank you!

1826
01:16:58,940 --> 01:17:02,640
I can't believe we broke 500k subscribers.

1827
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:03,840
I can't believe we broke 500k subscribers.

1828
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,520
I warn you right now.

1829
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:07,800
These are hardcore psychos.

1830
01:17:09,650 --> 01:17:11,790
I would rather kill you than speak to you.

1831
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:20,140
One or two of them will enjoy it too.

1832
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:22,360
Be careful.

1833
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:26,980
Oh shit, the Riddler?

1834
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:28,280
I never got to meet him.

1835
01:17:28,980 --> 01:17:29,920
Oh my god.

1836
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:34,880
I recently watched the new Batman movie with Robert Patterson.

1837
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:36,900
And like, okay.

1838
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,880
Okay, the Riddler's fucking outfit.

1839
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,280
I was like, why the fuck is he wearing BDSM gear?

1840
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:46,400
I was like, this is like a movie.

1841
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,120
Is that a GIMP?

1842
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:54,760
I can open doors?

1843
01:17:56,020 --> 01:17:56,980
Oh wait, no.

1844
01:17:58,360 --> 01:17:59,000
What?

1845
01:17:59,000 --> 01:17:59,400
Where?

1846
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:00,800
Oh!

1847
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:02,200
It's like stealth.

1848
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:05,320
Yeah, like the new...

1849
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:07,140
The Riddler in that new Batman...

1850
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:09,460
I don't fuck with his outfit.

1851
01:18:09,660 --> 01:18:10,960
I don't know.

1852
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:14,280
Just ain't right for him.

1853
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:16,220
I'm saying.

1854
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,200
You're wrong.

1855
01:18:20,740 --> 01:18:21,660
Oh no!

1856
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:26,280
Like, his...

1857
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:27,500
I don't know.

1858
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:28,260
I just...

1859
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:30,800
I don't... It made me very uncomfortable.

1860
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:32,360
The fuck?

1861
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:33,520
Oh shit, is that him?

1862
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:35,420
Who's that over there?

1863
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:36,900
Whoops, sorry.

1864
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:39,100
Who's that?

1865
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:40,140
Deceased.

1866
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:40,900
Do you think...

1867
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:42,760
Do you think the other guy's okay?

1868
01:18:51,930 --> 01:18:52,770
Dead end.

1869
01:18:54,630 --> 01:18:55,830
Oh shit!

1870
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:03,060
Track Gordon's moving by following Bull's whiskey trails.

1871
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:03,380
Track Gordon's moving by following Bull's whiskey trails.

1872
01:19:03,380 --> 01:19:04,660
Let me grab some tea first.

1873
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:07,580
Can I like do it fast?

1874
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:08,040
No.

1875
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:08,720
Oh I can!

1876
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:09,120
Nice.

1877
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:11,800
Oh yes, but I don't kill.

1878
01:19:19,110 --> 01:19:21,330
Can we take my fucking ass?

1879
01:19:21,710 --> 01:19:21,870
Can we take my fucking ass?

1880
01:19:21,870 --> 01:19:22,790
Can we take my fucking ass?

1881
01:19:22,790 --> 01:19:26,710
Can we take my fucking ass?

1882
01:19:30,550 --> 01:19:32,090
What the fuck?

1883
01:19:32,150 --> 01:19:32,730
Wait tech!

1884
01:19:33,130 --> 01:19:41,610
You complete a series of amusingly taxing challenges and well, you'll see.

1885
01:19:41,870 --> 01:19:43,450
Ready for your first one?

1886
01:19:43,530 --> 01:19:44,470
What's my first one?

1887
01:19:45,090 --> 01:19:46,070
But be careful.

1888
01:19:46,510 --> 01:19:50,970
Don't cut yourself on this sharply observed portrait.

1889
01:19:51,210 --> 01:19:51,890
This?

1890
01:19:51,890 --> 01:19:52,770
Object detected?

1891
01:19:53,090 --> 01:19:56,690
I said, don't cut yourself on this sharply observed portrait.

1892
01:19:56,690 --> 01:19:56,990
Object detected?

1893
01:19:56,990 --> 01:19:58,270
This is a sharply observed portrait.

1894
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:01,070
Oh shit!

1895
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:01,990
Did the stream die?

1896
01:20:02,290 --> 01:20:03,170
It's okay, I'm back.

1897
01:20:04,330 --> 01:20:05,290
Where the fuck?

1898
01:20:05,870 --> 01:20:07,450
What other portraits are there?

1899
01:20:11,230 --> 01:20:12,010
What are they?

1900
01:20:12,950 --> 01:20:13,430
No!

1901
01:20:14,070 --> 01:20:14,930
Oh I'm back.

1902
01:20:15,090 --> 01:20:16,670
Okay, the riddler broke the screen.

1903
01:20:17,290 --> 01:20:18,190
But don't worry, we're back.

1904
01:20:18,730 --> 01:20:19,210
Oh!

1905
01:20:19,290 --> 01:20:20,150
Is it this portrait?

1906
01:20:20,450 --> 01:20:21,630
There's another portrait right here.

1907
01:20:21,730 --> 01:20:22,610
Oh wait, no not that one.

1908
01:20:24,170 --> 01:20:24,650
Yeah!

1909
01:20:24,650 --> 01:20:25,390
You did it!

1910
01:20:25,470 --> 01:20:26,190
Well done!

1911
01:20:26,610 --> 01:20:31,390
I would have expected a child to work that one out, let alone the world's greatest detective.

1912
01:20:33,550 --> 01:20:34,550
What did I win?

1913
01:20:36,650 --> 01:20:38,450
What the fuck did I win?

1914
01:20:39,090 --> 01:20:40,830
What the fuck did I win?

1915
01:20:41,470 --> 01:20:42,370
What is it?

1916
01:20:42,390 --> 01:20:44,930
You don't know Jack about utility corridor.

1917
01:20:45,250 --> 01:20:47,130
You don't know Jack about Gotham.

1918
01:20:47,530 --> 01:20:49,710
Tune in to find out.

1919
01:20:50,050 --> 01:20:50,110
Tune in to find out.

1920
01:20:50,970 --> 01:20:52,290
What did I win?

1921
01:20:52,450 --> 01:20:53,930
What did I win?

1922
01:20:54,650 --> 01:20:56,330
Riddler, what the fuck did I win?

1923
01:20:57,630 --> 01:20:58,510
Okay, let's see.

1924
01:20:58,570 --> 01:20:59,870
Do I have enough to upgrade yet?

1925
01:21:00,830 --> 01:21:02,790
Oh, I need like $20.

1926
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:08,820
Oh, XP?

1927
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:10,000
I love XP.

1928
01:21:11,060 --> 01:21:12,680
Anything else I can do?

1929
01:21:13,940 --> 01:21:14,420
Hello.

1930
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:15,600
Do you have a name?

1931
01:21:17,020 --> 01:21:17,900
Oh my god, William!

1932
01:21:27,460 --> 01:21:27,800
William in gate.

1933
01:21:28,420 --> 01:21:31,600
Two of my guys moved to the exit and Frank shot him dead.

1934
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:33,440
They never stood a chance.

1935
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:34,920
Was Bowles alone?

1936
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:36,260
Thought he was.

1937
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:38,140
Then I saw Harley Quinn.

1938
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:40,980
She was surrounded by Black Gate prisoners.

1939
01:21:41,420 --> 01:21:43,660
They were just killing every last one of them.

1940
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:43,680
No!

1941
01:21:44,260 --> 01:21:45,580
I had no choice.

1942
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:47,200
I got in here, locked the door.

1943
01:21:47,420 --> 01:21:48,800
Don't worry, William.

1944
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:51,800
I'll never kill like them.

1945
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:56,160
Even though all your friends are dead.

1946
01:21:56,380 --> 01:21:57,340
Most of outlived is useful.

1947
01:21:57,460 --> 01:21:58,020
Good.

1948
01:21:58,400 --> 01:21:59,720
He was scum.

1949
01:22:03,330 --> 01:22:04,250
Don't worry.

1950
01:22:04,930 --> 01:22:06,270
I'll look after Maria.

1951
01:22:06,710 --> 01:22:08,370
Who the fuck is Maria?

1952
01:22:09,030 --> 01:22:10,750
Oh my god, you're gonna take his wife?

1953
01:22:16,170 --> 01:22:17,890
Bro, what the fuck?

1954
01:22:17,990 --> 01:22:18,670
He's dead!

1955
01:22:21,850 --> 01:22:23,230
That's fucked up, man.

1956
01:22:25,690 --> 01:22:28,170
Don't worry, my best friend.

1957
01:22:28,330 --> 01:22:28,830
Maria.

1958
01:22:29,310 --> 01:22:30,570
You'll be safe with me.

1959
01:22:33,270 --> 01:22:34,610
That's messed up.

1960
01:22:35,370 --> 01:22:38,150
I don't think he would want you to take care of her.

1961
01:22:39,030 --> 01:22:40,630
How do I get over there?

1962
01:22:41,070 --> 01:22:41,210
Oh.

1963
01:22:41,770 --> 01:22:42,850
God damn it.

1964
01:22:42,870 --> 01:22:43,890
I'm still weak as fuck.

1965
01:22:48,870 --> 01:22:49,810
Anything here?

1966
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:50,470
No.

1967
01:22:51,930 --> 01:22:52,530
Uh...

1968
01:22:52,530 --> 01:22:54,870
I had no choice.

1969
01:22:55,230 --> 01:22:55,830
No!

1970
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:57,030
No!

1971
01:22:57,070 --> 01:22:57,650
John!

1972
01:22:58,050 --> 01:22:58,950
You're dead!

1973
01:23:00,110 --> 01:23:00,670
Anyway...

1974
01:23:01,510 --> 01:23:04,250
Now I feel like he wanted him to be dead.

1975
01:23:04,530 --> 01:23:05,710
I apologize for this interruption.

1976
01:23:11,650 --> 01:23:12,470
Jack Ryder.

1977
01:23:12,550 --> 01:23:13,450
Who the fuck is Jack Ryder?

1978
01:23:33,390 --> 01:23:33,950
Scan.

1979
01:23:34,830 --> 01:23:35,390
Joker!

1980
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:36,230
No, scan.

1981
01:23:37,330 --> 01:23:37,890
Scan!

1982
01:23:38,850 --> 01:23:39,710
And you can all consider...

1983
01:23:51,550 --> 01:23:52,290
Call his bluff!

1984
01:23:52,490 --> 01:23:54,190
He's not crazy enough to do it!

1985
01:23:56,030 --> 01:23:56,590
I'll

1986
01:24:00,070 --> 01:24:00,210
bluff!

1987
01:24:00,690 --> 01:24:02,370
No one lives in that mansion anyway!

1988
01:24:02,930 --> 01:24:04,010
Just Alfred.

1989
01:24:04,230 --> 01:24:05,190
Just one guy.

1990
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:20,720
The audio keeps cutting in and out.

1991
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:21,520
Wait, is that true?

1992
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:25,580
Or is it just your YouTube?

1993
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:27,080
Is it just your YouTube?

1994
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,360
Alright, we need the critical combo.

1995
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:32,200
No, not Alfred.

1996
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:34,760
Did you know in the comic series...

1997
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:36,840
He's been dead for five years now?

1998
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:37,820
Apparently.

1999
01:24:38,380 --> 01:24:39,580
Oh, it's just that guy?

2000
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:41,780
Yeah, you got... I got one guy.

2001
01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:42,720
One guy!

2002
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:44,540
I think you gotta check your PC.

2003
01:24:44,900 --> 01:24:46,040
Tell that one guy that you're dead.

2004
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:46,760
I think you gotta check his PC.

2005
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:53,260
One guy!

2006
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:56,300
I think you gotta upgrade your PC.

2007
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:57,100
Sir.

2008
01:24:58,980 --> 01:25:00,140
Oh, I can open doors.

2009
01:25:01,460 --> 01:25:02,060
Spoilers?

2010
01:25:02,060 --> 01:25:03,100
It's not a spoil...

2011
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:06,420
Okay, you were never gonna read the fucking comic anyway.

2012
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:10,740
You know how I learned about that?

2013
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:12,300
From YouTube Shorts.

2014
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:15,800
Alright, eventually the YouTube Short algorithms...

2015
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:16,620
You'll find out.

2016
01:25:16,740 --> 01:25:17,060
You'll find out.

2017
01:25:17,060 --> 01:25:18,460
Okay, you'll find out.

2018
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:19,120
Okay, you'll find out.

2019
01:25:23,060 --> 01:25:24,200
You don't know that.

2020
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:25,200
Oh, yeah!

2021
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:27,880
When was the last time you read a fucking Batman comic?

2022
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:31,960
You do know people have not been reading comics in a long time.

2023
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:34,580
The comic industry is fucking dying!

2024
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:39,840
You... you are not gonna change!

2025
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:44,260
You're the reason why the comic industry is dying.

2026
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:47,160
I'm the reason why the comic industry is dying.

2027
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:49,720
I literally am... I literally just watched...

2028
01:25:49,740 --> 01:25:58,920
Oh, people read the... read the... It's sad but it's true.

2029
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:02,980
We all get our lore from fucking YouTube shorts!

2030
01:26:07,380 --> 01:26:09,420
Oh shit, is Poison Ivy gonna be here?

2031
01:26:14,890 --> 01:26:16,750
You're right, but still.

2032
01:26:16,870 --> 01:26:19,550
They booed her because she was right.

2033
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:36,020
Oh, there's a garden in the asylum?

2034
01:26:36,380 --> 01:26:37,720
Oh no, this is outside.

2035
01:26:38,020 --> 01:26:38,580
Nevermind.

2036
01:26:38,700 --> 01:26:43,100
I was like... I thought I was still like inside for some reason.

2037
01:26:43,180 --> 01:26:45,160
I thought this was just a really big green house.

2038
01:26:50,020 --> 01:26:52,980
Okay, escape from intensive treatment to the island surface.

2039
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:54,520
Nice.

2040
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:57,260
Are those my guards?

2041
01:26:59,540 --> 01:27:03,240
Alright, two hostiles, two armed, zero unarmed.

2042
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:04,300
No, these are my people.

2043
01:27:04,380 --> 01:27:05,400
Okay, these are not.

2044
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:05,780
Not my...

2045
01:27:05,780 --> 01:27:06,120
Whoa!

2046
01:27:06,580 --> 01:27:07,540
Oh, it's okay.

2047
01:27:07,620 --> 01:27:08,360
I have the Batcave.

2048
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:11,120
Nice.

2049
01:27:15,340 --> 01:27:16,440
It's me, Batman!

2050
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:33,500
Can I scan a person?

2051
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:35,400
No.

2052
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:36,860
He doesn't matter apparently.

2053
01:27:37,580 --> 01:27:40,040
Okay, you guys said scan wing tech.

2054
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:42,040
How the f...

2055
01:27:42,460 --> 01:27:42,740
Alert?

2056
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:44,320
Batmobile sensor?

2057
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:46,040
Where's my car?

2058
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:49,720
Batmobile's countermeasure system.

2059
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:50,680
I saw the alert.

2060
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:51,300
What's wrong?

2061
01:27:51,460 --> 01:27:52,200
Where are you?

2062
01:27:52,420 --> 01:27:53,860
I'm outside the Arkham Mansion.

2063
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:56,360
Harley Quinn probably triggered the alarm.

2064
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:59,220
If she still got Gordon with her, he could get hurt.

2065
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:00,000
Okay, done.

2066
01:28:00,220 --> 01:28:04,300
The Batmobile is still parked up outside the intensive treatment building in Arkham North.

2067
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:07,000
I sent you the schematics for the entire island.

2068
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:08,400
I've marked key locations...

2069
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:10,400
Oh my god, there's a lot of things in front of me.

2070
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:10,600
Thanks, Oracle.

2071
01:28:13,980 --> 01:28:15,240
This is a big map.

2072
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:16,780
Protect the Batmobile.

2073
01:28:17,580 --> 01:28:18,060
Okay.

2074
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:20,600
Medical facility...

2075
01:28:22,740 --> 01:28:23,620
Arkham Mansion.

2076
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:27,300
Alright, people are saying I should scan the f... wing.

2077
01:28:29,420 --> 01:28:30,400
Let me scan it.

2078
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:31,940
Let me scan it!

2079
01:28:32,380 --> 01:28:33,320
Wait, how do I zoom again?

2080
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:34,060
Okay, there you go.

2081
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:35,680
Come on.

2082
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:37,040
You know you want to scan it.

2083
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:40,300
Real soft.

2084
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:40,620
Yay!

2085
01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:45,340
I didn't even have to read your riddle.

2086
01:28:45,380 --> 01:28:46,220
I have backseaters.

2087
01:28:46,820 --> 01:28:48,040
I can look at... I can look at...

2088
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:48,700
I can look up about myself.

2089
01:28:50,640 --> 01:28:51,280
Okay.

2090
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:52,400
Where's my bio?

2091
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:55,000
Where is my billionaire bio?

2092
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:56,500
Bruce Wayne.

2093
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:59,520
Born into a wealthy Wayne family.

2094
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:01,500
Bruce Wayne had an idyllic childhood.

2095
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:03,060
Although he was given strong...

2096
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:05,940
Have I... Has Bruce Wayne ever graduated university?

2097
01:29:06,740 --> 01:29:09,140
Does he even have a master's degree in business?

2098
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:17,420
But his moralistic... moralistic and philatrap... philatrap... parents...

2099
01:29:17,420 --> 01:29:18,440
Thomas and Martha.

2100
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:20,660
After their violent murder...

2101
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:21,660
Um...

2102
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:23,420
At crime alley...

2103
01:29:24,580 --> 01:29:26,540
Bruce dedicated his life...

2104
01:29:26,540 --> 01:29:27,980
He bought one tip...

2105
01:29:27,980 --> 01:29:30,460
Piling the cruel element that took their lives.

2106
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,800
Yeah, it hasn't really helped much.

2107
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:38,320
He left Gotham for many years to train his medical... mental and physical abilities across the globe.

2108
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:42,020
Before finally returning to take up the mantle of the Dark Knight.

2109
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:44,740
It doesn't say if he even has an education.

2110
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:48,540
Why do you think...

2111
01:29:48,540 --> 01:29:51,200
Because he's running a fucking billionaire company.

2112
01:29:51,940 --> 01:29:53,140
I feel like...

2113
01:29:53,140 --> 01:29:56,920
I feel like you should have some sense of business sense.

2114
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:57,820
You know?

2115
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:00,320
I don't know.

2116
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:02,160
Am I crazy to think that?

2117
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:11,660
Is that too out of line to ask him to see if he has a business... a master's degree?

2118
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:14,160
He signs papers.

2119
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:14,720
I don't know.

2120
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:14,960
Or...

2121
01:30:17,470 --> 01:30:19,360
Is he expecting too much?

2122
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:21,440
He just signs the papers.

2123
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:25,580
They give him the documents and then that is it.

2124
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:30,600
Yeah, but don't you think he has to read the documents?

2125
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:31,820
Guys.

2126
01:30:32,470 --> 01:30:33,540
Is that too much?

2127
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:38,600
If he's gonna sign it, he has to read it too.

2128
01:30:38,860 --> 01:30:39,380
Right?

2129
01:30:40,980 --> 01:30:41,600
Like...

2130
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:44,680
Right?

2131
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:49,780
He has people to do that for him.

2132
01:30:49,860 --> 01:30:51,060
Oh shit.

2133
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:55,460
Not the ambulance, guys.

2134
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:58,240
Are you guys okay?

2135
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:03,600
Not Jackson!

2136
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:04,940
Guard Dump for Five?

2137
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:08,800
Oh my god!

2138
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:11,600
The dead guy has a name!

2139
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:17,860
This is so fucked up.

2140
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:20,500
No!

2141
01:31:20,860 --> 01:31:21,560
Jackson!

2142
01:31:23,620 --> 01:31:24,980
Oh shit!

2143
01:31:25,420 --> 01:31:26,480
Where's the gun?

2144
01:31:28,610 --> 01:31:31,780
Sorry, I didn't have my fucking detective mode on apparently.

2145
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:33,340
Alright.

2146
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:35,460
Let me get him on.

2147
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:37,000
Alright, there you go.

2148
01:31:38,140 --> 01:31:38,560
Boop.

2149
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:40,880
Goodbye!

2150
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:44,080
And... you only have...

2151
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:45,580
You get named when you die?

2152
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:46,440
Apparently.

2153
01:31:48,660 --> 01:31:51,680
You have no importance until you're dead.

2154
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:52,920
Oh shit.

2155
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:56,800
Twiddle Dee and Tweedledum saw it.

2156
01:31:56,820 --> 01:31:57,680
Can you see it?

2157
01:31:59,660 --> 01:32:00,340
No!

2158
01:32:00,420 --> 01:32:01,500
Not my fucking car!

2159
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:04,640
Fire Island will soon be under my control.

2160
01:32:05,180 --> 01:32:06,960
Jackson has been avenged.

2161
01:32:07,540 --> 01:32:08,020
Mine!

2162
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:08,400
Mine!

2163
01:32:14,580 --> 01:32:16,580
Bro, my car... I have no insurance!

2164
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:21,040
There's a lot of cutbacks here.

2165
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:22,880
I don't know how to get my car to work.

2166
01:32:23,780 --> 01:32:24,260
Hello.

2167
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:26,980
Oh, they don't have guns!

2168
01:32:27,060 --> 01:32:27,980
Wait, they don't have guns.

2169
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:29,240
This is good.

2170
01:32:30,980 --> 01:32:33,120
I guess I'll just beat them up.

2171
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:34,540
It's okay guys!

2172
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,680
No gun!

2173
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:38,400
Oh shit!

2174
01:32:40,440 --> 01:32:41,320
Give me a sec.

2175
01:32:47,180 --> 01:32:47,960
Oh fuck!

2176
01:32:48,940 --> 01:32:49,860
Oh, I'm disoriented!

2177
01:32:49,980 --> 01:32:50,960
I'm disoriented right now!

2178
01:32:51,340 --> 01:32:52,720
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

2179
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:54,820
Just take his pipe.

2180
01:32:56,380 --> 01:32:57,320
Oh shit, nice.

2181
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:00,760
Alright, punch him in the dick.

2182
01:33:01,540 --> 01:33:02,960
Alright, punch him in the head.

2183
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:05,200
Easy.

2184
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:11,640
Nice!

2185
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:12,660
That was easy.

2186
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:15,620
Oh my god!

2187
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:16,840
Oh my god!

2188
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:17,260
Oh my god!

2189
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:19,400
Well...

2190
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:23,520
Rest in peace, my car.

2191
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:26,060
Collect explosive gel.

2192
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:32,660
Can we use this to destroy structures?

2193
01:33:32,860 --> 01:33:33,780
Oh shit, nice!

2194
01:33:34,380 --> 01:33:36,320
I can finally destroy walls now!

2195
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:39,060
Explosives may harm...

2196
01:33:39,060 --> 01:33:39,380
May.

2197
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:42,920
Okay, but like, we don't care about that, right?

2198
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:45,240
As long as it doesn't hurt me.

2199
01:33:46,740 --> 01:33:47,860
People eventually...

2200
01:33:47,860 --> 01:33:49,140
They were gonna die eventually.

2201
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:49,640
I'm gonna die.

2202
01:33:49,660 --> 01:33:49,780
I'm gonna die.

2203
01:33:51,020 --> 01:33:52,400
My insurance, no!

2204
01:33:52,940 --> 01:33:53,200
I need to search the area around the Batmobile.

2205
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:55,220
There could be a clue as to where she took Gordon.

2206
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:58,940
I just think I don't have insurance, cause why the fuck would you insure a Batmobile?

2207
01:33:59,380 --> 01:34:00,960
Cause like, what's the point?

2208
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:03,260
Cause then, what's the point of having a secret identity?

2209
01:34:03,780 --> 01:34:05,520
If you try insuring a Batmobile?

2210
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:13,440
What am I supposed to scan?

2211
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:13,620
What am I supposed to scan?

2212
01:34:13,680 --> 01:34:15,140
Watching you guys is like a night in.

2213
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:17,440
Watching my favorite movie.

2214
01:34:18,540 --> 01:34:20,280
It's self-repairing!

2215
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:23,160
Attack of the stupid bungling idiots!

2216
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:24,420
Who can't find a job!

2217
01:34:24,440 --> 01:34:25,700
Wait, do I even have a license plate?

2218
01:34:29,100 --> 01:34:30,980
My god, I don't even have it licensed!

2219
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:34,680
My god, I don't even have it licensed!

2220
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:34,880
Okay.

2221
01:34:35,540 --> 01:34:36,400
Evidence scanner.

2222
01:34:36,740 --> 01:34:37,860
Alright, back seaters!

2223
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:40,180
Stay in the orange.

2224
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:44,060
Okay, but where the f- Where...

2225
01:34:44,820 --> 01:34:46,320
Am I supposed to scan?

2226
01:34:52,950 --> 01:34:54,510
Do I own an insurance company?

2227
01:34:55,710 --> 01:34:57,970
I just insured myself.

2228
01:34:58,450 --> 01:34:58,970
Oh.

2229
01:34:59,090 --> 01:34:59,430
Oh!

2230
01:35:02,710 --> 01:35:03,190
Oh!

2231
01:35:03,190 --> 01:35:05,190
What is it?

2232
01:35:07,430 --> 01:35:09,490
Does he carry a pipe with him?

2233
01:35:09,830 --> 01:35:10,650
Gordon's favorite tobacco.

2234
01:35:11,270 --> 01:35:12,670
Gordon's smarter than he looks.

2235
01:35:12,810 --> 01:35:14,030
Left me a trail to follow.

2236
01:35:14,770 --> 01:35:16,570
Oracle, I found a pipe.

2237
01:35:16,810 --> 01:35:19,010
It has your father's initials carved on it.

2238
01:35:19,270 --> 01:35:21,170
It was a birthday gift I gave him last year.

2239
01:35:21,390 --> 01:35:21,870
Really?

2240
01:35:22,150 --> 01:35:23,070
No way he'd leave it.

2241
01:35:23,630 --> 01:35:24,110
Exactly.

2242
01:35:24,550 --> 01:35:26,110
He's left me a trail to follow.

2243
01:35:26,310 --> 01:35:27,610
He's alive, Barbara.

2244
01:35:29,410 --> 01:35:30,370
Look, it's...

2245
01:35:30,370 --> 01:35:30,510
It's a pipe.

2246
01:35:30,530 --> 01:35:32,910
I don't need to detect anything when I have these fists.

2247
01:35:33,350 --> 01:35:34,710
How do I destroy this?

2248
01:35:35,090 --> 01:35:35,790
Joker here!

2249
01:35:42,590 --> 01:35:43,790
What's that rule, Joker?

2250
01:35:44,130 --> 01:35:45,470
Following this rule is death.

2251
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:52,100
It's a secret!

2252
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:58,080
Do I not have the explosive gel already?

2253
01:35:58,680 --> 01:35:59,500
I do!

2254
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:00,220
Okay.

2255
01:36:00,580 --> 01:36:01,380
Oh, okay.

2256
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:02,760
I can just do this.

2257
01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:03,380
Boop.

2258
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,200
Oh, I detonate it.

2259
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:10,000
Oh, that's just Batarang.

2260
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:13,720
Okay, LT to prepare explosive gel.

2261
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:14,960
They're not prepared it?

2262
01:36:15,980 --> 01:36:17,460
They're not prepared it enough?

2263
01:36:21,660 --> 01:36:22,300
Oh!

2264
01:36:22,700 --> 01:36:23,340
Okay.

2265
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:24,880
I'm learning.

2266
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:28,300
I drew the bat sign on it?

2267
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:29,860
Batman, please.

2268
01:36:31,700 --> 01:36:33,220
Time and place.

2269
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:36,220
It's gonna be blown up anyway.

2270
01:36:41,060 --> 01:36:42,460
Batman, please.

2271
01:36:42,540 --> 01:36:43,160
Who is this?

2272
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:43,980
Who's looking at this?

2273
01:36:44,100 --> 01:36:45,280
It's just you and I.

2274
01:36:46,360 --> 01:36:46,920
Brand.

2275
01:36:47,860 --> 01:36:49,480
You don't get it, Doki.

2276
01:36:49,620 --> 01:36:50,420
It's branding.

2277
01:36:51,020 --> 01:36:53,180
Who's gonna look at the brand?

2278
01:36:58,280 --> 01:36:59,880
Who's gonna look at the brand?

2279
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:00,980
Tell me.

2280
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:05,000
But the style...

2281
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:10,520
Batman is a banksy.

2282
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:13,760
To who?

2283
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:15,060
Who is sending the...

2284
01:37:15,060 --> 01:37:17,360
Who is he sending that message to?

2285
01:37:19,140 --> 01:37:20,400
Where am I supposed to go?

2286
01:37:20,660 --> 01:37:22,500
Locate Gordon by... Oh, the track is...

2287
01:37:23,080 --> 01:37:24,260
Okay, there it is.

2288
01:37:24,580 --> 01:37:26,360
Come over and see me.

2289
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:28,320
Don't look up when you open the door.

2290
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:30,120
We are...

2291
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:33,820
I'm going to have to find another way around to get back on track.

2292
01:37:33,820 --> 01:37:35,320
Wait, I want to know if there's anything up top.

2293
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:40,460
So he knows who's gel it belongs to.

2294
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:43,060
So he knows who's gel it belongs to.

2295
01:37:43,060 --> 01:37:43,140
So he knows who's gel it belongs to.

2296
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:46,040
Yeah, but I want to know if there's anything here.

2297
01:37:46,220 --> 01:37:47,020
I need to go search for it.

2298
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:47,540
What's this?

2299
01:37:48,140 --> 01:37:48,780
Ooh, Kate.

2300
01:37:57,330 --> 01:37:58,530
It says, Kate.

2301
01:37:58,690 --> 01:37:59,650
I'm sorry.

2302
01:38:05,730 --> 01:38:06,210
That's him.

2303
01:38:25,630 --> 01:38:26,510
The juggler.

2304
01:38:26,910 --> 01:38:28,270
Get my permanent record.

2305
01:38:28,410 --> 01:38:29,150
Be quiet, clone.

2306
01:38:30,110 --> 01:38:31,550
What the fuck is that other guy?

2307
01:38:31,910 --> 01:38:33,670
He claims a different type of psychosis.

2308
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:44,080
I don't believe it.

2309
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:45,200
He can have everything.

2310
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:49,600
There are things you cannot cure.

2311
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:52,420
Who the fuck hired this psych...

2312
01:38:52,420 --> 01:38:53,020
There is...

2313
01:38:53,020 --> 01:38:54,480
That is a fucking lie.

2314
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:59,040
There are some mental disorders you cannot cure.

2315
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:01,820
What are her credentials?

2316
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:03,760
It's not fucking physical.

2317
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:04,860
It's inner.

2318
01:39:09,170 --> 01:39:10,250
Oh my god.

2319
01:39:10,310 --> 01:39:14,830
Don't trust a psychiatrist that's like, anything can be cured.

2320
01:39:15,150 --> 01:39:17,030
You know what can't be fucking cured?

2321
01:39:17,690 --> 01:39:18,750
Can't... Oh wait, no.

2322
01:39:18,770 --> 01:39:19,250
Cancer can.

2323
01:39:19,550 --> 01:39:21,110
Depending on what type of cancer.

2324
01:39:22,010 --> 01:39:22,570
Nevermind.

2325
01:39:25,050 --> 01:39:25,610
Rabies!

2326
01:39:26,110 --> 01:39:27,570
Rabies can't be cured!

2327
01:39:27,670 --> 01:39:28,190
Doctor!

2328
01:39:28,930 --> 01:39:30,450
What about rabies?

2329
01:39:33,190 --> 01:39:34,510
Oh wait, let's see.

2330
01:39:37,690 --> 01:39:38,470
Banksy time.

2331
01:39:40,310 --> 01:39:40,870
Alright.

2332
01:39:41,250 --> 01:39:42,190
That's what I'm saying!

2333
01:39:42,250 --> 01:39:44,870
Don't trust a doctor that says anything can be cured.

2334
01:39:45,110 --> 01:39:46,690
That's just giving false hope.

2335
01:39:47,830 --> 01:39:49,310
Rabie... No it can't!

2336
01:39:49,550 --> 01:39:51,650
When you get rabies, you fucking die!

2337
01:39:53,190 --> 01:39:53,830
Oop.

2338
01:39:56,750 --> 01:39:58,450
It can kinda.

2339
01:39:59,390 --> 01:40:00,030
Alright.

2340
01:40:00,270 --> 01:40:03,090
If you say it can kinda.

2341
01:40:03,350 --> 01:40:05,070
That doesn't mean...

2342
01:40:09,250 --> 01:40:11,170
If it's caught in time.

2343
01:40:11,350 --> 01:40:13,410
Okay, if it's caught in time.

2344
01:40:13,550 --> 01:40:14,090
Yes.

2345
01:40:14,330 --> 01:40:17,970
But like, it doesn't mean it's curable all the time.

2346
01:40:26,110 --> 01:40:26,710
Alright.

2347
01:40:31,430 --> 01:40:33,350
Can I like unlock it from the outside?

2348
01:40:33,990 --> 01:40:34,870
Or inside?

2349
01:40:39,150 --> 01:40:39,750
Nothing.

2350
01:40:39,850 --> 01:40:40,290
Exactly!

2351
01:40:40,670 --> 01:40:41,610
That's what I mean!

2352
01:40:41,810 --> 01:40:43,490
That's why you don't trust any psychiatrist.

2353
01:40:43,710 --> 01:40:44,770
Or doctor.

2354
01:40:44,970 --> 01:40:46,990
That says anything can be cured.

2355
01:40:47,630 --> 01:40:48,910
That's just like...

2356
01:40:49,670 --> 01:40:50,270
Malpractice.

2357
01:40:50,330 --> 01:40:51,530
At that point.

2358
01:40:53,790 --> 01:40:54,910
Where are the enemies?

2359
01:40:55,310 --> 01:40:56,230
Eight host... Eight?

2360
01:40:57,570 --> 01:40:58,850
Oh shit, wait.

2361
01:40:59,110 --> 01:40:59,590
Whoa!

2362
01:41:00,170 --> 01:41:01,810
Can I head there now?

2363
01:41:03,870 --> 01:41:04,430
Ow.

2364
01:41:04,590 --> 01:41:05,310
Whoops, nope.

2365
01:41:08,010 --> 01:41:09,170
Trust no one.

2366
01:41:09,190 --> 01:41:10,330
Not even doctors.

2367
01:41:11,890 --> 01:41:13,710
Actually no, please trust your doctors.

2368
01:41:14,190 --> 01:41:15,730
Please don't do home remedies.

2369
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:21,840
Oh.

2370
01:41:23,240 --> 01:41:23,800
Skin.

2371
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:26,840
Skin.

2372
01:41:31,390 --> 01:41:32,610
Wait, are these good guys?

2373
01:41:32,610 --> 01:41:34,990
Oh, they are definitely not good guys.

2374
01:41:36,710 --> 01:41:38,510
Oh, they are definitely not good guys.

2375
01:41:41,450 --> 01:41:42,150
Don't worry.

2376
01:41:42,350 --> 01:41:45,650
They won't be able to see me when I walk very slow up to them, right?

2377
01:41:47,930 --> 01:41:48,430
Hello.

2378
01:41:53,860 --> 01:41:55,460
Yeah, he's too busy working.

2379
01:41:55,700 --> 01:41:57,380
Yeah, he's too busy working.

2380
01:41:58,480 --> 01:42:00,000
He won't know either.

2381
01:42:00,420 --> 01:42:00,480
He won't know either.

2382
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:01,520
Wait, what are they building?

2383
01:42:02,160 --> 01:42:03,120
What is this?

2384
01:42:03,120 --> 01:42:07,800
Are they trying to improve the structural integrity of this building?

2385
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:09,900
Then why am I silencing them?

2386
01:42:11,240 --> 01:42:11,920
Why?

2387
01:42:15,020 --> 01:42:17,920
They're just carpenters, Dokie.

2388
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:20,620
What the fuck is wrong with you?

2389
01:42:24,780 --> 01:42:27,580
They're just trying to fix the structure.

2390
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:32,320
I can't believe it.

2391
01:42:32,340 --> 01:42:33,100
We got a castle.

2392
01:42:33,100 --> 01:42:33,520
Cancel Batman.

2393
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:36,980
Is he okay?

2394
01:42:37,700 --> 01:42:38,540
Are you okay?

2395
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:44,220
Yeah, but I want to talk to this one guy.

2396
01:42:53,020 --> 01:42:54,140
Can't believe it.

2397
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:56,840
Batman is against fucking handymen.

2398
01:42:58,820 --> 01:43:00,400
He's against trade schools.

2399
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:03,000
What?

2400
01:43:03,100 --> 01:43:04,120
I want to talk to this one guy.

2401
01:43:05,020 --> 01:43:06,440
I want to see if he has a name.

2402
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:10,440
Alright, I'll go inside.

2403
01:43:18,540 --> 01:43:19,100
What?

2404
01:43:19,180 --> 01:43:19,420
Me?

2405
01:43:19,880 --> 01:43:20,440
No.

2406
01:43:20,980 --> 01:43:21,880
Wait, go inside?

2407
01:43:22,180 --> 01:43:22,540
What's inside?

2408
01:43:25,660 --> 01:43:26,220
Hello?

2409
01:43:28,340 --> 01:43:28,900
Hello?

2410
01:43:36,660 --> 01:43:37,220
Whoa.

2411
01:43:42,940 --> 01:43:43,560
I was thinking.

2412
01:43:43,780 --> 01:43:46,380
You really could use a friend in here.

2413
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:48,900
Someone to talk to.

2414
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:50,220
Share secrets.

2415
01:43:50,220 --> 01:43:51,040
He doesn't need friends.

2416
01:43:51,120 --> 01:43:52,400
That's why he adopts kids.

2417
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:54,860
To fill that hole in his heart.

2418
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:57,240
Who is that behind the mask?

2419
01:43:57,600 --> 01:44:02,100
Why do you feel the need to go out into the world and fight people like me?

2420
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:04,260
Do you really think you could win?

2421
01:44:04,260 --> 01:44:04,740
Oh, I can move.

2422
01:44:05,680 --> 01:44:06,840
We'll see.

2423
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:09,880
Wait,

2424
01:44:13,890 --> 01:44:15,110
this is first person now.

2425
01:44:15,270 --> 01:44:15,930
That's interesting.

2426
01:44:18,370 --> 01:44:19,810
Where do I go though?

2427
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:24,140
Huh?

2428
01:44:32,240 --> 01:44:33,720
Can't do anything here.

2429
01:44:38,930 --> 01:44:40,890
Oh, is it only this building?

2430
01:44:43,010 --> 01:44:43,990
Is that it?

2431
01:44:44,210 --> 01:44:45,110
Do I leave?

2432
01:44:45,890 --> 01:44:46,530
Okay.

2433
01:44:52,250 --> 01:44:52,890
Joker?

2434
01:44:53,570 --> 01:44:55,190
Oh, you come back later.

2435
01:44:55,510 --> 01:44:57,170
Oh, it's an Easter egg.

2436
01:44:57,170 --> 01:44:57,410
Oh, it's an Easter egg.

2437
01:44:59,390 --> 01:44:59,670
Okay.

2438
01:45:00,130 --> 01:45:01,830
It's just to talk to Joker.

2439
01:45:02,030 --> 01:45:02,230
Oh!

2440
01:45:04,250 --> 01:45:05,550
I was gonna say.

2441
01:45:06,810 --> 01:45:07,910
I was gonna say.

2442
01:45:08,050 --> 01:45:08,390
Like.

2443
01:45:08,690 --> 01:45:09,830
What do I do next?

2444
01:45:10,190 --> 01:45:10,870
That's interesting.

2445
01:45:11,670 --> 01:45:13,810
That it's like first person.

2446
01:45:15,630 --> 01:45:17,250
Go back inside later?

2447
01:45:18,210 --> 01:45:20,710
Is it trying to turn into some fucking horror film?

2448
01:45:21,390 --> 01:45:22,570
Alright, where's the tobacco?

2449
01:45:22,950 --> 01:45:23,550
Oh, there it is.

2450
01:45:24,170 --> 01:45:25,690
There's six hostiles.

2451
01:45:25,690 --> 01:45:26,610
Six unarmed.

2452
01:45:27,410 --> 01:45:27,750
They don't have guns!

2453
01:45:28,190 --> 01:45:29,370
Time to beat them up.

2454
01:45:30,310 --> 01:45:31,410
They don't have guns.

2455
01:45:31,470 --> 01:45:32,010
This is perfect.

2456
01:45:33,010 --> 01:45:34,170
Wait, what's over there?

2457
01:45:34,390 --> 01:45:36,130
Oh shit, that's a lot of dead people.

2458
01:45:40,790 --> 01:45:42,530
Joker, you already said that again.

2459
01:45:42,690 --> 01:45:44,270
It wasn't funny the first time.

2460
01:45:45,130 --> 01:45:46,250
It wasn't cool!

2461
01:45:48,130 --> 01:45:48,570
Wait.

2462
01:45:48,710 --> 01:45:49,230
You know what?

2463
01:45:49,270 --> 01:45:50,390
I'm just gonna beat them up for XP.

2464
01:45:51,730 --> 01:45:52,470
Oh shit!

2465
01:45:52,770 --> 01:45:53,370
It's fine.

2466
01:45:53,590 --> 01:45:54,410
They don't have guns.

2467
01:45:54,910 --> 01:45:55,630
I ain't scared.

2468
01:45:57,410 --> 01:45:57,690
They don't have guns.

2469
01:45:57,690 --> 01:45:58,630
Oh shit, you have teeth!

2470
01:45:59,490 --> 01:46:00,470
Give me a sec.

2471
01:46:02,950 --> 01:46:03,470
Nice.

2472
01:46:04,070 --> 01:46:05,790
I love that money mashing.

2473
01:46:06,310 --> 01:46:06,830
Alright.

2474
01:46:06,910 --> 01:46:07,050
No!

2475
01:46:07,210 --> 01:46:07,530
Fuck!

2476
01:46:07,570 --> 01:46:07,830
Okay.

2477
01:46:07,970 --> 01:46:09,230
Oh shit.

2478
01:46:09,290 --> 01:46:09,650
No!

2479
01:46:11,950 --> 01:46:12,890
Alright, we're fine.

2480
01:46:13,450 --> 01:46:14,250
Big punch!

2481
01:46:14,870 --> 01:46:15,190
Oh!

2482
01:46:17,630 --> 01:46:18,150
Alright.

2483
01:46:19,210 --> 01:46:19,990
Brain damage!

2484
01:46:21,850 --> 01:46:22,410
It's fine.

2485
01:46:23,650 --> 01:46:25,670
I might get a little bit of brain damage too.

2486
01:46:26,410 --> 01:46:29,010
But I'm a streamer, so it's like part of the job.

2487
01:46:33,630 --> 01:46:34,510
But I'm a streamer, so it's like part of the job.

2488
01:46:34,510 --> 01:46:34,950
Alright, nice.

2489
01:46:39,490 --> 01:46:40,690
Wait, where's the other one?

2490
01:46:41,370 --> 01:46:42,250
Where's the other teeth?

2491
01:46:43,630 --> 01:46:45,190
Oh my gosh, so hard to see the teeth.

2492
01:46:46,210 --> 01:46:48,270
You can't say thank you for the AKASUPA!

2493
01:46:48,430 --> 01:46:48,830
Thank you!

2494
01:46:49,490 --> 01:46:49,930
Potato.

2495
01:46:51,170 --> 01:46:51,770
That's me.

2496
01:46:53,110 --> 01:46:54,970
I swear to god, like...

2497
01:46:56,110 --> 01:46:57,950
Honestly, I feel like...

2498
01:46:57,950 --> 01:47:00,490
I should have like a...

2499
01:47:00,490 --> 01:47:02,330
A life to life...

2500
01:47:02,330 --> 01:47:04,190
A life to life exchange.

2501
01:47:04,290 --> 01:47:07,130
If they get to kill two people, I get to kill two people.

2502
01:47:07,670 --> 01:47:08,570
Cause like...

2503
01:47:08,570 --> 01:47:10,710
I'm pretty sure...

2504
01:47:10,710 --> 01:47:13,050
This is like ten families already.

2505
01:47:13,110 --> 01:47:14,710
Just in this general vicinity.

2506
01:47:15,530 --> 01:47:18,010
I have to like...

2507
01:47:18,010 --> 01:47:20,050
Pay for ten extra families.

2508
01:47:23,250 --> 01:47:24,890
Alright, open door.

2509
01:47:25,670 --> 01:47:26,290
Yay!

2510
01:47:30,180 --> 01:47:30,820
Harley!

2511
01:47:32,300 --> 01:47:33,180
Hey there.

2512
01:47:33,480 --> 01:47:34,460
Hey there, girl.

2513
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:39,680
Where's Gordon?

2514
01:47:40,360 --> 01:47:41,500
Wouldn't you like to know?

2515
01:47:41,500 --> 01:47:42,000
I'm over here!

2516
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:44,880
You crazy bitch!

2517
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:45,520
Wait, where is he?

2518
01:47:48,140 --> 01:47:49,260
What's he doing?

2519
01:47:49,680 --> 01:47:50,860
It's too early!

2520
01:47:53,500 --> 01:47:55,520
I can fix her.

2521
01:47:56,540 --> 01:47:57,200
You'll be happy with me.

2522
01:47:57,200 --> 01:47:57,600
Best

2523
01:48:01,460 --> 01:48:02,120
day manager.

2524
01:48:02,120 --> 01:48:03,740
Oh, they're definitely...

2525
01:48:03,740 --> 01:48:05,660
They definitely like to have a voyeur too.

2526
01:48:06,140 --> 01:48:07,640
Oh yeah, they're freaky.

2527
01:48:09,140 --> 01:48:10,720
They're definitely freaky.

2528
01:48:11,820 --> 01:48:12,500
They're definitely freaky.

2529
01:48:13,340 --> 01:48:14,840
Yeah, it's Tara Strong.

2530
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:18,820
Before she got super weird.

2531
01:48:24,060 --> 01:48:24,740
Okay.

2532
01:48:27,120 --> 01:48:29,980
One of the weirdest shit about her...

2533
01:48:29,980 --> 01:48:31,580
Is that like...

2534
01:48:32,120 --> 01:48:34,000
This is what's my gripe about...

2535
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:34,920
Tara Strong.

2536
01:48:35,460 --> 01:48:36,540
Oh, it's not?

2537
01:48:36,700 --> 01:48:37,360
It's not her?

2538
01:48:37,660 --> 01:48:39,020
Oh shit, it's not?

2539
01:48:39,100 --> 01:48:39,400
Okay.

2540
01:48:39,660 --> 01:48:40,780
But anyway...

2541
01:48:40,780 --> 01:48:44,200
One of the weirdest shit about her...

2542
01:48:44,200 --> 01:48:46,060
Is that she was like...

2543
01:48:46,060 --> 01:48:47,660
No AI voices.

2544
01:48:48,360 --> 01:48:51,240
So because it hurts the voice acting industry.

2545
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:53,760
And then later on she was like...

2546
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:55,140
But AI art is okay.

2547
01:48:56,240 --> 01:49:01,380
I thought that was like pretty weird.

2548
01:49:01,380 --> 01:49:03,360
Not gonna lie.

2549
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:04,180
I was like...

2550
01:49:04,180 --> 01:49:06,080
Alright, you can't pick and choose that.

2551
01:49:09,560 --> 01:49:12,120
I just thought that was fucking weird.

2552
01:49:17,580 --> 01:49:24,560
I feel like if you have a stats regarding a certain thing.

2553
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:27,620
I feel like you shouldn't pick and choose.

2554
01:49:31,560 --> 01:49:32,880
Oh, that's Arlene?

2555
01:49:33,260 --> 01:49:39,040
I thought that was Tara's job because usually they get Tara for Harley Quinn.

2556
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:48,720
Alright, let's see.

2557
01:49:52,920 --> 01:49:55,520
Search for a structural weakness in the exterior?

2558
01:49:56,600 --> 01:50:00,840
At this point, everything should be a structural weakness in this fucking city.

2559
01:50:02,120 --> 01:50:03,780
Alright, let's see.

2560
01:50:07,080 --> 01:50:08,660
But now 14 years ago?

2561
01:50:08,740 --> 01:50:13,420
Wasn't Tara Strong like the original voice actor- actress for Harley Quinn?

2562
01:50:14,280 --> 01:50:17,800
I thought she was when the original animated series.

2563
01:50:18,180 --> 01:50:18,820
Or was it...

2564
01:50:18,820 --> 01:50:20,500
Or was it Arlene?

2565
01:50:20,600 --> 01:50:22,040
Oh, Arlene was the original?

2566
01:50:22,540 --> 01:50:23,040
Oh!

2567
01:50:26,100 --> 01:50:26,780
Okay.

2568
01:50:28,280 --> 01:50:29,420
I didn't know that.

2569
01:50:32,490 --> 01:50:33,610
That's Arlene.

2570
01:50:33,670 --> 01:50:35,630
Why is Arlene not as popular?

2571
01:50:39,450 --> 01:50:40,130
Okay.

2572
01:50:40,130 --> 01:50:40,810
Batman.

2573
01:50:42,690 --> 01:50:43,830
Alright, dead meat.

2574
01:50:44,250 --> 01:50:44,930
Nice.

2575
01:50:50,200 --> 01:50:52,800
Oh, she's... she passed away.

2576
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:54,800
Okay, that makes a lot more sense.

2577
01:50:54,980 --> 01:50:56,060
I didn't know that.

2578
01:51:03,380 --> 01:51:09,820
I think I like how Mark Hamill retired Joker when Kevin Conroy passed away.

2579
01:51:10,620 --> 01:51:11,960
Because that's very respectful.

2580
01:51:13,540 --> 01:51:14,540
I don't know why.

2581
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:15,940
What?

2582
01:51:16,180 --> 01:51:16,260
What?

2583
01:51:16,340 --> 01:51:17,460
Did I break this?

2584
01:51:28,420 --> 01:51:29,400
That's fucked up.

2585
01:51:29,540 --> 01:51:31,460
Being a doctor is very hard, Joker.

2586
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:35,180
He spent like at least 10 years to get that degree, man.

2587
01:51:35,660 --> 01:51:37,780
We don't have enough people, Joker!

2588
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:45,340
If we don't have doctors in Gotham City, then like, who the fuck is gonna patch you up?

2589
01:51:45,340 --> 01:51:47,220
There's not enough veterinarians for that!

2590
01:51:52,300 --> 01:51:53,640
Yeah... oh, this way.

2591
01:51:55,180 --> 01:51:57,800
Wait, how am I supposed to get the fucking trophy?

2592
01:52:00,780 --> 01:52:01,700
Where am I going?

2593
01:52:02,060 --> 01:52:02,940
He said...

2594
01:52:03,820 --> 01:52:05,500
He said Death Joker.

2595
01:52:07,100 --> 01:52:07,780
Oh, nice!

2596
01:52:07,860 --> 01:52:08,460
Trophy time.

2597
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:12,920
Veterinarians?

2598
01:52:12,980 --> 01:52:13,760
Yeah, you don't know that?

2599
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:15,260
I learned this from a movie.

2600
01:52:15,260 --> 01:52:16,220
But like...

2601
01:52:16,220 --> 01:52:20,080
Sometimes the mob use the veterinarians to patch them up.

2602
01:52:20,740 --> 01:52:21,260
Illegally.

2603
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:23,480
So they don't have to go through a real doctor.

2604
01:52:24,280 --> 01:52:25,840
Obviously, movies are true.

2605
01:52:32,100 --> 01:52:32,620
Obviously!

2606
01:52:33,200 --> 01:52:36,300
What you see in the movies is what's actually going on.

2607
01:52:36,460 --> 01:52:37,020
Who's that guy?

2608
01:52:38,020 --> 01:52:39,020
Is that a doctor?

2609
01:52:41,620 --> 01:52:42,140
Yeah.

2610
01:52:45,260 --> 01:52:45,760
We do.

2611
01:52:46,360 --> 01:52:46,800
True.

2612
01:52:47,640 --> 01:52:48,080
Whoops.

2613
01:52:55,420 --> 01:52:56,300
Inverted takedown.

2614
01:52:57,480 --> 01:52:57,920
Woah!

2615
01:52:58,040 --> 01:52:58,400
Shit!

2616
01:52:59,680 --> 01:53:00,400
They don't see!

2617
01:53:00,460 --> 01:53:00,860
They don't see!

2618
01:53:00,880 --> 01:53:01,260
They don't see!

2619
01:53:02,120 --> 01:53:02,560
Woah!

2620
01:53:04,020 --> 01:53:05,200
Don't worry, I'm too fast.

2621
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:06,780
I'm too fast.

2622
01:53:09,420 --> 01:53:10,060
Oh, wait.

2623
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:11,780
I should not have done that actually.

2624
01:53:15,480 --> 01:53:15,960
Oh, hey.

2625
01:53:17,020 --> 01:53:17,860
He doesn't know.

2626
01:53:17,980 --> 01:53:19,260
Oh, that's a lot of people.

2627
01:53:19,460 --> 01:53:20,660
Oh, okay.

2628
01:53:20,740 --> 01:53:21,800
That is a lot of people.

2629
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:24,340
Can I do more than one person?

2630
01:53:26,080 --> 01:53:27,280
Wait, where's the doctor?

2631
01:53:28,120 --> 01:53:29,800
What if I accidentally kill the doctor?

2632
01:53:31,860 --> 01:53:32,460
Can I?

2633
01:53:34,040 --> 01:53:35,620
Okay, this is science reasons.

2634
01:53:37,620 --> 01:53:38,200
Okay, no.

2635
01:53:38,260 --> 01:53:38,760
She's safe.

2636
01:53:39,100 --> 01:53:39,500
Alright.

2637
01:53:40,580 --> 01:53:41,920
I just wanted to know!

2638
01:53:42,080 --> 01:53:44,020
Because what if I accidentally kill her?

2639
01:53:44,580 --> 01:53:45,140
You know?

2640
01:53:47,660 --> 01:53:50,720
I'm just trying to make sure I don't accidentally kill anybody.

2641
01:53:52,500 --> 01:53:52,980
Alright.

2642
01:53:53,140 --> 01:53:55,680
I'm totally gonna get shot at when I do this.

2643
01:53:55,900 --> 01:53:55,980
I'm totally gonna get shot at when I do this.

2644
01:53:57,260 --> 01:53:58,060
Stealth mission.

2645
01:53:58,440 --> 01:54:00,520
I've been pretty stealthy like this, right?

2646
01:54:00,980 --> 01:54:01,680
Come on!

2647
01:54:02,060 --> 01:54:03,140
Get over here!

2648
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:06,000
Wait.

2649
01:54:06,160 --> 01:54:06,740
Oh, there you go.

2650
01:54:07,200 --> 01:54:07,680
Yay!

2651
01:54:10,360 --> 01:54:11,980
Don't worry, I'll just fly.

2652
01:54:12,480 --> 01:54:12,860
Don't worry, I'll just fly.

2653
01:54:12,860 --> 01:54:13,260
Just keep flying.

2654
01:54:14,160 --> 01:54:15,080
He doesn't know.

2655
01:54:17,380 --> 01:54:17,820
Okay.

2656
01:54:18,420 --> 01:54:19,140
Come on!

2657
01:54:19,480 --> 01:54:21,400
After I kill the bat!

2658
01:54:21,560 --> 01:54:22,540
Yeah, after.

2659
01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:24,780
It's all about after.

2660
01:54:26,460 --> 01:54:26,900
Okay.

2661
01:54:26,900 --> 01:54:27,800
Maybe I...

2662
01:54:29,620 --> 01:54:30,500
What's going on?

2663
01:54:30,640 --> 01:54:32,080
Can I make them go over there?

2664
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:35,400
Can I make them walk over there?

2665
01:54:36,120 --> 01:54:36,880
I can!

2666
01:54:38,660 --> 01:54:39,660
He's not gonna look up.

2667
01:54:39,660 --> 01:54:40,120
Trust me.

2668
01:54:40,940 --> 01:54:41,580
Come on!

2669
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:42,100
Where are you?

2670
01:54:42,240 --> 01:54:42,600
Come on!

2671
01:54:43,260 --> 01:54:43,860
Head down here.

2672
01:54:43,900 --> 01:54:44,680
You know you want to.

2673
01:54:45,580 --> 01:54:46,320
Come on!

2674
01:54:46,940 --> 01:54:47,680
Come on!

2675
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:49,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

2676
01:54:50,380 --> 01:54:51,080
Come on!

2677
01:54:52,940 --> 01:54:54,160
It's just two more steps?

2678
01:54:56,500 --> 01:54:57,020
Wait.

2679
01:54:57,220 --> 01:54:58,040
Wait a minute.

2680
01:55:01,160 --> 01:55:02,380
Wait a minute!

2681
01:55:02,720 --> 01:55:04,200
Okay, I can do it here.

2682
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:06,520
I was gonna be like, that's...

2683
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:09,180
I got lied to.

2684
01:55:11,240 --> 01:55:11,760
Okay.

2685
01:55:13,260 --> 01:55:13,340
Come over here.

2686
01:55:14,840 --> 01:55:16,260
You know you want to.

2687
01:55:17,600 --> 01:55:19,540
You know you wanna walk over there.

2688
01:55:21,360 --> 01:55:22,320
Come on!

2689
01:55:28,240 --> 01:55:29,200
Come on!

2690
01:55:29,780 --> 01:55:30,000
Come on!

2691
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:30,500
Oh, fuck it.

2692
01:55:30,540 --> 01:55:30,820
I can't.

2693
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:32,140
I'm not patient enough for this.

2694
01:55:32,460 --> 01:55:33,100
Fuck this.

2695
01:55:34,420 --> 01:55:36,660
His teammate's not gonna be helping him anyway.

2696
01:55:38,620 --> 01:55:39,480
Oh, shit!

2697
01:55:42,140 --> 01:55:42,620
Okay.

2698
01:55:44,080 --> 01:55:45,680
Now he's not gonna...

2699
01:55:45,680 --> 01:55:45,920
Wait.

2700
01:55:46,020 --> 01:55:46,680
Is it...

2701
01:55:47,220 --> 01:55:47,640
Is he gonna shoot me?

2702
01:55:47,980 --> 01:55:49,320
No, he can't tell.

2703
01:55:49,740 --> 01:55:50,920
Is that the last guy?

2704
01:55:51,220 --> 01:55:51,500
Alright.

2705
01:55:51,780 --> 01:55:52,220
Wee!

2706
01:55:54,380 --> 01:55:54,940
Boom!

2707
01:55:56,020 --> 01:55:57,020
Get over here.

2708
01:56:01,070 --> 01:56:01,630
Nice!

2709
01:56:04,030 --> 01:56:05,110
I did it!

2710
01:56:09,030 --> 01:56:09,590
Doctors!

2711
01:56:09,950 --> 01:56:11,310
What is going on?

2712
01:56:11,870 --> 01:56:13,290
I did it, Doctors!

2713
01:56:15,290 --> 01:56:17,070
Looks like Harleen with the hair.

2714
01:56:17,450 --> 01:56:18,190
I don't know what happened.

2715
01:56:19,390 --> 01:56:21,830
Every red haired girl, Harleen.

2716
01:56:22,050 --> 01:56:23,170
Harley Quinn.

2717
01:56:29,310 --> 01:56:30,030
Harley Quinn.

2718
01:56:43,630 --> 01:56:45,450
Harley is blonde?

2719
01:56:45,950 --> 01:56:48,270
Okay, I'm thinking about red hair, Harley.

2720
01:56:53,170 --> 01:56:54,810
I'm thinking about poison ivy hair.

2721
01:56:55,150 --> 01:56:56,610
I'm... okay, sorry.

2722
01:56:56,790 --> 01:56:58,790
I was watching Harley Quinn earlier.

2723
01:56:59,250 --> 01:57:01,850
And like, my hair colors got mixed up.

2724
01:57:04,750 --> 01:57:07,110
I was thinking about poison ivy.

2725
01:57:09,750 --> 01:57:11,050
I'm gonna say...

2726
01:57:11,050 --> 01:57:13,390
newest season of Harley Quinn...

2727
01:57:13,390 --> 01:57:14,570
pretty fucking shit.

2728
01:57:17,350 --> 01:57:19,130
The writing for that...

2729
01:57:19,130 --> 01:57:21,350
was god fucking weird.

2730
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:28,760
Oh, interview tape.

2731
01:57:30,360 --> 01:57:36,160
Fake fa- Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. I didn't know Alfred died five years ago.

2732
01:57:36,300 --> 01:57:38,000
And was never brought back.

2733
01:58:04,020 --> 01:58:05,360
Then two legs.

2734
01:58:05,620 --> 01:58:07,560
And finally three legs.

2735
01:58:08,380 --> 01:58:09,740
Old man!

2736
01:58:10,420 --> 01:58:11,100
Yeah!

2737
01:58:11,300 --> 01:58:13,120
Oh, sorry, yeah, human, yeah.

2738
01:58:14,320 --> 01:58:16,440
Oh, wait, I'm so fucking smart.

2739
01:58:16,860 --> 01:58:17,800
Good try.

2740
01:58:18,120 --> 01:58:20,540
But the answer to all three is a baby.

2741
01:58:24,300 --> 01:58:25,740
What the fuck?

2742
01:58:30,690 --> 01:58:31,590
It's horrible.

2743
01:58:31,790 --> 01:58:33,370
How can you even joke about that?

2744
01:58:34,010 --> 01:58:34,930
Easily, doctor.

2745
01:58:35,830 --> 01:58:37,470
It's not my baby.

2746
01:58:38,310 --> 01:58:38,810
Whoa!

2747
01:58:40,310 --> 01:58:41,190
Geez, really?

2748
01:58:42,330 --> 01:58:43,250
That's fucked up.

2749
01:58:44,170 --> 01:58:45,170
That's fucked up.

2750
01:58:48,370 --> 01:58:49,630
Alright, let's see.

2751
01:58:52,530 --> 01:58:53,670
Where am I supposed to go?

2752
01:58:53,750 --> 01:58:56,250
Oh, I'm so close to leveling up.

2753
01:58:57,470 --> 01:58:57,910
Damn.

2754
01:58:59,670 --> 01:59:02,610
I mean, if you think about it, it works with old elderly too.

2755
01:59:07,020 --> 01:59:08,440
Oh, there's... oh, I can't...

2756
01:59:08,440 --> 01:59:09,700
I don't have the upgrade yet, right?

2757
01:59:10,680 --> 01:59:12,240
Oh, no, that's just a gargoyle.

2758
01:59:23,590 --> 01:59:24,110
I'm just gonna go to the other side.

2759
01:59:24,110 --> 01:59:24,850
It's the simple things.

2760
01:59:25,770 --> 01:59:27,590
Oh, shit, look at his packs though.

2761
01:59:27,930 --> 01:59:29,190
From that angle.

2762
01:59:30,690 --> 01:59:31,210
Alright.

2763
01:59:32,410 --> 01:59:33,770
Where am I supposed to go?

2764
01:59:34,170 --> 01:59:35,850
Locate and rescue Dr. Young.

2765
01:59:35,990 --> 01:59:38,250
Locate and rescue Dr. Kellerman.

2766
01:59:38,390 --> 01:59:39,930
Locate and rescue Dr. Chen.

2767
01:59:40,070 --> 01:59:40,630
Oh, it's Chen.

2768
01:59:40,670 --> 01:59:41,270
It's all the doctors.

2769
01:59:41,750 --> 01:59:42,270
Alright.

2770
01:59:42,610 --> 01:59:43,970
Does it really matter though?

2771
01:59:44,710 --> 01:59:47,270
Do we really need to rescue all these doctors?

2772
01:59:48,550 --> 01:59:49,750
Do we really need to rescue all these doctors?

2773
01:59:53,420 --> 01:59:54,680
Wouldn't Tool be enough?

2774
01:59:54,820 --> 01:59:55,040
Wouldn't Tool be enough, guys?

2775
01:59:57,140 --> 01:59:57,620
Uhh...

2776
01:59:57,620 --> 01:59:59,480
I'm so confused where to go.

2777
02:00:02,220 --> 02:00:03,220
Yeah, I don't like...

2778
02:00:03,220 --> 02:00:06,780
The only thing I don't like is when you go from detective mode... Oh, shit.

2779
02:00:06,880 --> 02:00:07,140
Nice.

2780
02:00:09,060 --> 02:00:11,680
When you go from detective mode to like...

2781
02:00:11,680 --> 02:00:12,460
uh...

2782
02:00:12,460 --> 02:00:15,500
to like normal mode, I do not like the flashes.

2783
02:00:18,220 --> 02:00:21,840
I can literally just hire more doctors outside of...

2784
02:00:21,840 --> 02:00:22,220
Oh, nice.

2785
02:00:23,680 --> 02:00:25,420
Outside of Gotham City.

2786
02:00:26,900 --> 02:00:29,440
I know earlier I was like, think of the doctors.

2787
02:00:29,540 --> 02:00:31,320
But now I'm like, wait, I can hire more.

2788
02:00:32,440 --> 02:00:32,900
Alright.

2789
02:00:34,680 --> 02:00:35,460
What do I upgrade?

2790
02:00:37,540 --> 02:00:38,500
Backseaters, it's time.

2791
02:00:39,260 --> 02:00:41,200
It's time to optimize my build.

2792
02:00:41,780 --> 02:00:42,240
Hahaha.

2793
02:00:45,500 --> 02:00:46,360
It's time.

2794
02:00:46,460 --> 02:00:47,780
It's optimization.

2795
02:00:49,320 --> 02:00:50,040
Armor?

2796
02:00:50,040 --> 02:00:50,760
Okay.

2797
02:00:50,840 --> 02:00:51,400
Vrooshit 1.

2798
02:00:51,600 --> 02:00:51,840
Alright.

2799
02:00:52,100 --> 02:00:53,160
Holy fuck.

2800
02:00:53,440 --> 02:00:53,820
Hahaha.

2801
02:00:54,540 --> 02:00:58,020
Oh my god, the fucking icon for that.

2802
02:00:59,160 --> 02:01:00,320
Why would they... Money!

2803
02:01:01,160 --> 02:01:02,380
It's always money.

2804
02:01:03,200 --> 02:01:03,920
Why?

2805
02:01:04,420 --> 02:01:08,460
You pay enough money, people will risk everything.

2806
02:01:12,070 --> 02:01:14,190
Where the fuck is the elevator?

2807
02:01:15,210 --> 02:01:15,570
Okay.

2808
02:01:16,070 --> 02:01:16,790
Alright.

2809
02:01:17,450 --> 02:01:18,430
How do I open that door?

2810
02:01:18,710 --> 02:01:19,730
Can I open doors?

2811
02:01:20,210 --> 02:01:21,710
Oh, I just press... Okay.

2812
02:01:21,970 --> 02:01:23,930
How do I open...

2813
02:01:23,930 --> 02:01:25,830
God, I'm so...

2814
02:01:27,250 --> 02:01:30,170
How do I open this door?

2815
02:01:31,190 --> 02:01:31,470
Alright.

2816
02:01:32,270 --> 02:01:34,030
Wait, how do we save this game?

2817
02:01:34,670 --> 02:01:35,670
Where's the checkpoint?

2818
02:01:36,010 --> 02:01:38,210
Oh my god, where's the checkpoint in this game?

2819
02:01:41,170 --> 02:01:41,730
Hahaha.

2820
02:01:41,730 --> 02:01:41,910
Hahaha.

2821
02:01:42,470 --> 02:01:42,650
Hahaha.

2822
02:01:47,710 --> 02:01:48,350
Warden!

2823
02:01:49,050 --> 02:01:49,690
Warden!

2824
02:01:50,650 --> 02:01:51,290
Warden!

2825
02:01:51,290 --> 02:01:52,970
Good afternoon, Arkham.

2826
02:01:53,070 --> 02:01:54,490
Let's talk about the mind.

2827
02:01:54,850 --> 02:01:59,390
How can such a complex entity be understood and eventually treated when it breaks?

2828
02:01:59,610 --> 02:02:00,470
How, indeed.

2829
02:02:01,450 --> 02:02:09,270
Project Titan's goal is to create a test bed to fully probe our special cases in a safe, risk-free manner.

2830
02:02:10,450 --> 02:02:13,630
Our goal is to cure more unfortunate specimens.

2831
02:02:14,110 --> 02:02:14,870
The weak.

2832
02:02:15,030 --> 02:02:18,710
Those not physically up to the challenge that our medical practices present.

2833
02:02:19,570 --> 02:02:22,630
Project Titan will make us a world-class facility.

2834
02:02:22,870 --> 02:02:24,550
An award-winning facility.

2835
02:02:25,130 --> 02:02:35,310
When you or someone you know is seriously distressed, there are few institutions where they can be taken, and where you can be reassured that they are safe and undergoing the finest care available.

2836
02:02:35,690 --> 02:02:41,090
An extensive breakdown of our costs and healthcare packages can be found at the front desk.

2837
02:02:41,230 --> 02:02:42,170
Is that a real site?

2838
02:02:42,690 --> 02:02:44,870
I had to be like 14 years ago.

2839
02:02:45,090 --> 02:02:46,050
... slash prices.

2840
02:02:46,370 --> 02:02:48,950
We accept most major HMOs.

2841
02:02:49,550 --> 02:02:53,390
Let me introduce you all to the sterling work of our new head of research...

2842
02:02:53,390 --> 02:02:54,970
Wait, let me open this door.

2843
02:02:55,310 --> 02:02:56,910
Is there an odd save when I open this door?

2844
02:02:57,090 --> 02:02:57,510
Let's try.

2845
02:02:58,610 --> 02:03:00,030
Does it tell me an icon?

2846
02:03:00,670 --> 02:03:02,510
Is that an... How do I know?

2847
02:03:05,210 --> 02:03:06,030
How do I...

2848
02:03:06,030 --> 02:03:08,590
How do I know if that auto saved me?

2849
02:03:09,810 --> 02:03:10,250
...

2850
02:03:11,290 --> 02:03:11,730
...

2851
02:03:13,170 --> 02:03:13,690
Okay.

2852
02:03:14,590 --> 02:03:15,910
Did that auto save?

2853
02:03:17,410 --> 02:03:18,110
It saved?

2854
02:03:18,710 --> 02:03:19,230
Alright.

2855
02:03:19,810 --> 02:03:25,090
Alright, we're gonna call it here because in an hour, we're gonna have another stream.

2856
02:03:25,210 --> 02:03:27,930
I'm sorry if I couldn't do a longer stream today.

2857
02:03:28,250 --> 02:03:29,170
It was a bonus.

2858
02:03:29,230 --> 02:03:30,490
This is a bonus stream.

2859
02:03:30,710 --> 02:03:32,550
But I had so much fun.

2860
02:03:33,210 --> 02:03:33,730
Um...

2861
02:03:34,850 --> 02:03:39,410
I'm gonna call it here so I can have a little bit of time in between streams.

2862
02:03:39,630 --> 02:03:41,730
Guys, but thank you everybody for coming!

2863
02:03:42,470 --> 02:03:42,970
This has been so much fun!

2864
02:03:43,270 --> 02:03:44,810
This has been so fun so far.

2865
02:03:45,430 --> 02:03:45,910
Uh...

2866
02:03:45,910 --> 02:03:47,130
But thank you everybody!

2867
02:03:47,530 --> 02:03:49,970
Thank you for all the super chats, for all the memberships!

2868
02:03:50,110 --> 02:03:53,850
I'll see you guys in an hour with Ditto and Uto.

2869
02:03:54,370 --> 02:03:57,830
Um... We're gonna be playing Apex Rank, uh... together.

2870
02:03:58,070 --> 02:04:00,950
We are the Apex Pred girl squad.

2871
02:04:02,410 --> 02:04:02,890
Um...

2872
02:04:02,890 --> 02:04:07,170
Um... Even though Uto is not Pred, she is Pred in my heart.

2873
02:04:07,370 --> 02:04:12,170
But yeah, as always everybody stay hydrated, posture check, get a bit more around to get that blood flowing.

2874
02:04:12,470 --> 02:04:16,950
If you stay up for me, maybe stay up a little longer for some more... for some Apex.

2875
02:04:17,490 --> 02:04:19,130
Yeah, I'll see you guys next time everybody!

2876
02:04:20,090 --> 02:04:21,050
Bye guys!

2877
02:04:21,770 --> 02:04:22,250
Bye!
