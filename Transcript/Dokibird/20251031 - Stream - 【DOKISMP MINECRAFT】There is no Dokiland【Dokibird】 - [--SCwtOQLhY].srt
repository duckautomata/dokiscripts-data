15
00:10:32,200 --> 00:12:15,020

16
00:12:15,020 --> 00:13:27,420
overall for themselves like if i sold 30 30 000 units like after one day uh it'll be fucking crazy like I might as well get like brand deals with Nike or some shit like but like they've already sold like 3,000 units overall from all the collaborations and um usual sales they do and it's like um it's like they are the number one um uh controller uh controller custom controller brand in Japan as well so I was very shocked that they reached out to me um to do this collaboration um and I'm like and that they've worked with for this so you might see in the collaborations they've worked with a lot of other japanese vtubers and i'm their very first overseas vtubers that they've reached out to collaborate on it and they also worked with alliance like they worked with a lot of japanese esports teams as well as alliance uh too so you can see they've done with fanatic they've worked with fanatic they worked with um riddle um so like a bunch of like uh well-known jp esport orgs as And it is a

17
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:31,000
controller that is used by a lot of Japanese pro players, too.

18
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,160
So, you know, it basically elevates your gaming.

19
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,000
Or if you want to be a casual, that's okay too.

20
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,820
It is, it is, you know, Toki bird theme.

21
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:42,460
Yeah!

22
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,880
It's such a cool merch, honestly.

23
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:48,080
I think this is one of the coolest merch I've got.

24
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:53,360
This is a very unique type of merchandise, I guess, especially for my VTuber.

25
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,580
Because, like, you know, you don't really see that often.

26
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:01,720
You know, getting like a fucking professional controller, like Doki Bird branded controller and everything.

27
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,180
Like it's so cool.

28
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:08,720
Um, um, so like I said, there's like several presets that you can do for this.

29
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,520
So there's the design only.

30
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,560
So it's the normal controller without these.

31
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:17,960
I believe it's just like without these back pedals or anything.

32
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,420
But you do still get like, you know, the Doki Bird branding on it.

33
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:22,900
Um, so they're really cute.

34
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,840
You know, it's so clean.

35
00:14:24,840 --> 00:15:21,400
like preters are up for one month um i believe um and others also so there's the fps config as well for this design so it comes with the two rear buttons and then the smart triggers which is this and no vibration too um there's an option to remove vibration on these controllers as well um but yes um if before you guys couldn't do shipping um it was a little bug slash glitch in the system so they accidentally like put in 400 kg versus 400 versus 400 grams um on on the like for shipping for the item for some countries so that's why like some of you guys weren't able to uh yeah 400 kg They accidentally put 400 kg versus 400 grams And that's why,

36
00:15:21,460 --> 00:16:47,360
like, for those who weren't able to order from certain countries Because they made a little oopsie So if you weren't able to order it before because of that error Do not worry, you should be able to place your order now The heaviest controller in the world Not only is this my very first V2 PlayStation controller is also the heaviest they add like they added like tungsten steel into the controller so it's like meal more so me emmer me emmer or some like doors hammer yeah if you can lift this controller you are worthy and also I also had like the dokey bird custom config so there's like four rear buttons instead of just two so more key bindings that you can bind to your controller um but yeah it's it's it's really cool this has been like in the works for more than a year i think they've like contacted me like a year ago about this opportunity and we've been working with them for like you know we've been working with them there's lots of logistics and everything um but But also,

37
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,200
for those who are wondering, like, oh, what about an Xbox controller?

38
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,020
I'm only an Xbox controller user.

39
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:58,500
Well, if we make enough sales, you know?

40
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,040
Wink, wink, wink, wink, wink.

41
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:08,980
There might be a future opportunity with a new design, with a new design.

42
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:16,500
So it's like, you know, it'll be like a nice little thing for your dokey份 where you can hang up, like, you know, different controllers and stuff.

43
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:44,380
on the wall and it'll be a new design too so I'm saying you know if we if we have enough so then you know maybe you can complete the collection in some way you guys have to buy more for me man why don't you just buy the PlayStation 1 to hang on the wall

44
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,060
You gotta, you gotta, you gotta help out too, Matt.

45
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,480
Like, I mean, you guys, you're part of the dragons.

46
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,900
It can be a, yeah, it can be a decorative controller.

47
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,260
You know what to do, dragons.

48
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,740

50
00:18:15,340 --> 00:19:36,400
I know some of you guys were like, to have an xbox one as well but you know a little incentive chat just a little bit of an incentive for the future um um uh but yeah no i'm i i'm super duper excited in in general uh uh to to you know have this controller um as uh as something i could sell um you know as something to give you guys an opportunity to purchase as a dragon because you know it's so cool it's just really cool like a natural pro gamer like it doesn't have you don't have to customize it as like a you know a pro controller but you know like in general it's just such a cool opportunity i've never seen myself having like a a controller as a merch in general um um so it was very very exciting to work with void gaming uh work in void void gaming as well and for them to reach out to me too like i didn't reach out to them they they reached out to me with this opportunity i was like what the fucking course yes i'll say yes yeah like cool else you know like it it feels like such like

51
00:19:36,400 --> 00:20:50,480

To avoid any completely unprecedented situation such as people crowding your plot, you should get stick enchanted with knockback launching ammo.

64
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,040
That's such a fucking good idea.

65
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,000
I'm going to rate that.

66
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:59,380
I'm going to screenshot this actually and give myself that power in the future.

67
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,700
So, today we closed the server down.

68
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:12,380
That was my solution to how to fix the problem.

69
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,340
And it was to close the server down.

70
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:19,380
So only I have access to the server right now.

71
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,580
For today.

72
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,440
For today.

73
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,980
So I can actually, you know, walk around.

74
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,340

00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,540
It's a CEO.

133
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,140
All right, what's this egg?

134
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:12,900

135
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:13,780
Oh, shit.

136
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,340
This is where all the eggs hang out.

137
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,400
Why is there a fucking dog in the egg church?

138
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,480

That's cool.

141
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,920
There's a church here, too.

142
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,180
I don't think I'll ever find Doki Lund again.

143
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,220
I read TP back to my house.

144
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,500
Actually, I don't even need to go to Doki Lawn.

145
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,420
I just remember there's nothing there.

146
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,640
It's the one that lays eggs.

147
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,700
Oh, tree house.

148
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,600
Oh, my God.

149
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,400
They built a little tree house up here.

150
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,900
Oh, that's cute.

151
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,340
He'll never know.

152
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,280
It's like my little bark.

153
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,080
That's cute.

154
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,700
El Spawn.

155
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,300
Oh, my God.

156
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,320
It's like a little rollercoaster too.

157
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:06,480
Oh.

158
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,540
That's really cute.

159
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:09,480
All right.

160
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,980
Did everyone build around me?

161
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,760
I bet you everyone build around Dookilat.

162
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:23,080
It's like at Disneyland, there's like all these little resorts and like malls and hotels and little like tourist traps outside of Disneyland.

163
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,440
Like that's you guys.

164
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,820
You guys are my...

165
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:29,460
You'll never compare to the real thing.

166
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,640
You're just a tourist trap.

167
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,820
That's a dookie lawn.

168
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,740
Okay, so.

169
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:48,040
Wait, okay, I was gonna say, how did you get in here?

170
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,180
What the fuck?

171
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,180
Who are you?

172
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,620
Who's in J22?

173
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,620
Who are you?

174
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,220
This is the admin?

175
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,060
I don't remember you.

176
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,420
What is this?

177
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,400
What is this area?

178
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,200
The dragon grave.

179
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:09,280
I don't remember no graveyard sanctioned next to my fucking house.

180
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,180
Who approved this?

181
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,220
Who approved this build?

182
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,560
This is the honor, so please don't deflate things.

183
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,000
Tom Atlas.

184
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:21,440
Oh, wait.

185
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,720
What's this?

186
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,420
Dokeybird.

187
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:25,480
What?

188
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,560
The memorial dust was completed by.

189
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,340
And those were lost amid the stars.

190
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,800
I'm going to take this book right now.

191
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,660
I'm going to take it.

192
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,760
You'll never.

193
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,440
I delete the records.

194
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,980
I never forget.

195
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,600
We're forgetting right now.

196
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,980
We're going to...

197
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,720
She's erasing history.

198
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,420
I'm going to erase history right now.

199
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,120
I'm so cute.

200
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,240
Please.

201
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,340
Never forget, we're forgetting here.

202
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,360
Like...

203
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,940
That's right.

204
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,760
That's right.

205
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,040
There was no book here.

206
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,180
That's it.

207
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,400
Where the fuck is...

208
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,140

209
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,720
Get this out of here.

210
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:30,800

211
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,360
I have an idea.

212
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:47,160
I'm building a wall, this unsightly godly sightly thing next to my house.

213
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,500
It's so creepy.

214
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:54,140
The internet stays out of my.

215
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,280

216
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,260

00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:53,200

Don't hurt the gas.

00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,100

00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,300

291
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:10,100

292
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,280

00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,200
Admin, bring this happy gas back to Doki Line.

00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:44,220
This is my, what's that word?

301
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:49,220
I have pillaged Germany and took...

302
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,340
I like how Mexico is next to Germany.

303
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:57,460
Bring this happy guest back to Dokilan.

304
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,220
It's mine now.

305
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,980
It's my hostage.

306
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,840
That's right.

307
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,140
He works for me.

308
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:10,880
You know what?

309
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,020
You don't want me even here.

310
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,720
It's almost the same.

311
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,800
Yeah, I have a hostage now.

312
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,760
I have a hostage, Germany!

313
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,180
Don't fuck with me.

314
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,360
Hello, Doki Bird.

315
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,720

316
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,060

325
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:57,180
And then change this one flag to bedrock.

326
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,320
Good idea.

327
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,000
Who gave me that idea?

328
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:07,140
I want this one flag to be made of bedrock.

329
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,960
Just this flag, though.

330
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,340

00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,420
Oh, that's, oh, my God.

336
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,760
Is this, like, the delegation?

00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,760
Don't piss me off.

344
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,220
I have the power of bedrock on my side.

345
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,420
Yeah, is this parliament?

346
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:24,280
This is where you guys come in here to think you're safe from me.

347
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,200
That's looking right.

348
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,120
You think you can have...

349
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,140
You think you have a democracy here?

350
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,520
That's looking right.

351
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,480
Admin!

352
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,200

353
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,940
Replace all of these handles with bedrock.

354
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:45,140
of these animals with bedrock right now.

355
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,540
They don't have the power to vote here.

356
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,000
Doki, stop.

357
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,080
That's a key, right?

358
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,660
And someone stop.

359
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:00,620
Are you thinking you can vote in Doki land?

360
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,040
That's a key, right?

361
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,300
Get out of here.

362
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,900

Oh, wait, I remember there's Mexico right behind me.

369
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,180
Wait, I'm heading to Mexico.

370
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,040

372
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,980
Bum, bum, bum.

373
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:07,120
The tribe has turned a small home for a low-income family into bedrock.

374
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,020
Just remember, Germany.

375
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:15,000
I have one of your citizens hostage.

376
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,260
So don't mess with me.

377
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,940
Oh, Doe Kitty Land.

378
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,460
What makes this Doe Kitty?

379
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,680
I don't know what this build is for.

380
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,420
I don't know what this part is.

381
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,540
Mizuki, thank you for the super chat.

382
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:35,860
Thank you.

383
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,500
Thank you.

384
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,620
Wait, what does that do?

385
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,040
What does the window escape button do?

386
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,960
Oh, there's Mexico.

387
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:45,420
Wait.

388
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,840
This is Mexico?

389
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,800
There's nothing here except...

390
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:54,780
There's nothing here in Mexico except for sheep and a horse.

391
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,020
Admin, I thought you...

392
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:00,240
I thought I told you to bring this...

393
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,900
To bring him home!

394
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,280
Exactly.

395
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:13,360
Admin, I thought I told you to bring this hostage back home to Doki Land.

396
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:17,680
Like, how is this Mexico?

397
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,100
I don't understand.

398
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,600
Or is this a Pia filter?

399
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,780
Yeah, that's right.

400
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:28,160
Bring him back to Doki Land.

401
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:30,400
That's right, Jeremy.

402
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:33,940
If you make a move, this guy gets it.

403
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:39,900
That's right.

404
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,260
Can't do anything with this.

405
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:46,280
Or your citizen gets it.

406
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,100
Alright.

407
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,160
He's my hostage.

408
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,020
Oh shit, there's like a little private ship here.

409
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,500
What is this?

410
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,080
High court of Doki.

411
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,920
There's like a little... What is this?

412
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:04,680
Prosecutor.

413
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:07,100
Defense.

414
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:09,580
Oh my god, it's like their little roleplay session.

415
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:10,720
Because we don't...

416
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,440
Because I am the law.

417
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:13,440
So you guys don't need it.

418
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:16,900
You don't actually need a system when I am the legal system.

419
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,340
Wait, what's this?

420
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:21,980
What is that?

421
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:27,330
What does this do?

422
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:32,450
Change Mexico to Fedora.

423
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:37,570
Oh, shit, it's croaky!

424
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:43,450
What happens when it's turkey?

425
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:44,210
You're not here.

426
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:45,870
How do we govern ourselves?

427
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:46,770
Yeah, that's

428
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:55,590
Oh my god, it's so cute!

429
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:56,910
Wait, I love this!

430
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:57,970
I love this build.

431
00:43:58,290 --> 00:43:59,630
That's so fucking cute.

432
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:03,050
A giant-ass croaky, a croaky bear.

433
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:11,160
Yeah, if I'm not here to govern, that's not my problem.

434
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:19,160
Wait, there was like a floating ship up here.

435
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:24,100
Wait, what is that?

436
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,440
What the fuck is that?

437
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:31,040
What is that?

438
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:31,980
Is that Star Fox?

439
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:36,100
What is this?

440
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:39,760
Is this like a little...

441
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:43,320
Is this a falcon?

442
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,540
Like, is that plane?

443
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,940
Crokey is a bedrock.

444
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,900
Thank you, thank you.

445
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,340
I know it's definitely not the Death Star.

446
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:00,580
Signalis?

447
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,720
Wait, what is that?

448
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,040
What is Signalis?

449
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:09,160
Is that like a...

450
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,460
Is that a game?

451
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:15,340
Oh, I need...

452
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,200
Admin!

453
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:17,180
Make it day!

454
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,480
I'm too lazy to type it.

455
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:24,080
A game worth playing?

456
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:24,740
Oh, okay.

457
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,180
I'll look it up later.

458
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,180
Oh my god.

459
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:32,380
What the fuck is going on down here?

460
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,060
Holy shit.

461
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:37,380
It's like a fucking pit of animals.

462
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:40,160
He won't miss one sheep.

463
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:43,320
Oops.

464
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:46,480
Oh my god.

465
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,520
They're like invincible.

466
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:48,960
What is he going to do?

467
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,420
Count the sheep that he loves.

468
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,480
When you're fishing.

469
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:53,880

In my house.

476
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,180
Whose house is it going to be?

477
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:10,120
If you're nice, if you're naughty, I'll turn you into bedrock.

478
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,420
If you're nice, I'll also turn you into bedrock.

479
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:19,480
It's all about the quality here.

You know what?

483
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:00,820

484
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,340
Alright, I'm picking a building.

485
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:12,710

486
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:14,950

487
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:19,470

488
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:22,050
My house took you down.

489
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:25,190
Which building do I pick?

490
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:27,230
He need me need money

491
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:47,350
Tokey they're home there's limits tokey tokey down Who would lose the gotcha who would lose the bedrock gotcha

492
00:48:53,240 --> 00:49:09,310
Please I just paid the mortgage i just wasn't i was finally able to afford a home in the woodlands took you not my property should have thought it that before you build a cemetery next to my home

493
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:26,910
that's right all right let's see what would happen if i turn this entire building into better eye.

494
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,250
This is just like Gotha.

495
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:30,130
Let's see.

496
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:32,270
What happened?

497
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:36,850
Okay, first I need to figure out how to fucking get out of here.

498
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:38,930
That's it.

499
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:43,450
If I am unable to... Okay, okay, I left that.

500
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:45,330
I was able to climb down.

501
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:47,210
Come on, man.

502
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:51,710
The hardest house in the server.

503
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:52,810
All right.

504
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:56,750
All right, I picked my house.

505
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:04,450
That's right.

506
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:06,050
I picked it.

507
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:06,470
Yeah!

508
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:20,950
The dokey giveth and the dokey continue to give.

509
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:27,870
I did it.

510
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:30,430
One house is not like the other.

511
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:32,290
Which house could it be?

512
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:37,770
God is a divine punishment.

513
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:42,590
It ceases endless of bedrock.

514
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:46,310
What are the point goods to do?

515
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:51,030
My fucking house, bro.

516
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:53,910
I would say this is an improvement, honestly.

517
00:50:54,510 --> 00:51:00,390
In fact, I would say this increases the property value because God has touches your home.

518
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:06,630
So, you know, that's God's gift to the Void Goons.

519
00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:12,430
Yeah, it'll last for the ages, chat.

520
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:16,210
It'll last for a long time.

521
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:21,910
You know, if there is a nuclear bomb in the Voidlands, at least you'll live.

522
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:24,710
Yeah, see, you guys have a bunker now.

523
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:27,590
Look at that.

524
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:31,830
I giveth you guys a bunker in case there are...

525
00:51:32,310 --> 00:51:33,790

526
00:51:33,850 --> 00:51:34,830
Whoa, my God.

527
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:37,970
I thought that bomb dropped down right now there.

528
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:39,770
Oh my God, is this my navy?

529

Blackmail.

660
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:50,100
It's not Blackmail, but I'm the only one who's a server.

661
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:52,220
It's just a suggestion.

662
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:55,020
It's just a very helpful suggestion.

663
01:03:57,540 --> 01:03:58,220

What's this?

668
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:11,980
It's a little sphinx.

669
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:13,940
How to play?

670
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,580
Blackjack tried to run away, watch the horse.

671
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:20,140
Blackjack says, keep gambling.

672
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:21,740
Wait, admin!

673
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:23,320

674
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:27,300

01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:52,480
Build a giant dokey Here we go.

679
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:58,800
All right What that means for all right, how does it?

680
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:01,600
Put the diamond into the shulker.

681
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:03,280
Push the button.

682
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:07,460
You absolute monster.

683
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:09,740
Let me thank you with a super chat.

01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:14,680
I got very inspired by Stewie TK.

687
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:20,460
On my timeline, it was all about Stewie TK.

688
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:23,020

Push the button.

01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:29,080
Lose the gamble so I can make.

691
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:30,340
make a profit.

692
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:37,820
If the lever up, it is a single pull.

693
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,740
If it is down, it will keep rolling.

694
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,180
If it stops working up, but okay.

695
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:45,860
The horse piece is real.

696
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:46,920
Wait, which lever?

697
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:47,380
This lever?

698
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:48,300
Oh, it's this lever.

699
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:50,960

What's the big book?

703
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:56,100
Oh, that's just a horse.

704
01:05:57,220 --> 01:05:58,260
Give me a second.

705
01:05:58,420 --> 01:05:58,820
I'm trying to read.

706
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:00,020
Book of fortune.

707
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:04,220
Let me take the book to type your fortune or even your frustration.

708
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:05,520
Don't break even.

709
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:06,240
Didn't break even.

710
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:07,920
Can't pay my taxes now.

711
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:08,880
All right.

712
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:12,920
I'm so glad you haven't found where I live.

713
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:15,240
I just started a few weeks ago.

714
01:06:15,620 --> 01:06:17,180
Oh, thank you for the super chat.

715
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:17,640

01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:19,460
Yes.

718
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:21,380
Wait, can I just pull this?

719
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:25,280
Okay, so I do need a deposit.

720
01:06:29,490 --> 01:06:30,030

Where's the button?

723
01:06:36,050 --> 01:06:37,110
Oh, it's here.

724
01:06:39,550 --> 01:06:40,210
Push the button.

725
01:06:41,770 --> 01:06:43,490
Oh, it's this box.

726
01:06:43,730 --> 01:06:44,010
Okay.

727
01:06:45,190 --> 01:06:45,970
I'm stupid.

728
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:51,430
Did I do it?

729
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,660
Where the fuck is my gambler?

730
01:07:02,610 --> 01:07:04,690

731
01:07:04,790 --> 01:07:06,590
How many diamonds do you need?

732
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:15,200

01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:16,840

That taxes and oppression in Doki land.

765
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:38,800
Too much for the long goons to injure.

766

Rise up, long goons to fight against the tide.

767

This message is brought to you by the eight goons.

768

Captured gas from Mexico slash Germany.

All right, admin.

789
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:29,270
We're going to make a prison.

790
01:11:31,390 --> 01:11:32,170
Here we go.

791
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:32,890
All right.

01:11:33,170 --> 01:11:34,050
No, he's right here.

793
01:11:34,210 --> 01:11:34,430
All right.

794
01:11:34,550 --> 01:11:38,090
We got to make a prison for the gas.

795
01:11:38,330 --> 01:11:40,250
Admin, make a prison for the gas.

796
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:47,720
A bedrock prison.

797
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:50,320
A bedrock prison with a singular...

798
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:52,780
with a window so we all know he's in there.

799
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:57,320
I'll watch.

800
01:12:03,810 --> 01:12:04,310
Shit.

801
01:12:06,810 --> 01:12:07,550
Yeah, it didn't work.

802
01:12:07,670 --> 01:12:09,210
Make sure he's not dead, too.

803
01:12:09,330 --> 01:12:10,790
Make sure he doesn't die.

804
01:12:12,430 --> 01:12:14,650
Make sure he doesn't die from it.

805
01:12:16,590 --> 01:12:19,130
It's not happy anymore.

806
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:24,530

There we go.

819
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:59,560
Make the windows unbreakable, transparent barriers.

820
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:00,380
That's a good idea.

821
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:01,320
You heard that, Aiman?

822
01:14:01,940 --> 01:14:02,920
Do that.

823
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:06,880
Except thinking about the super chat thing.

824
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:10,260
I don't know how you can do it, but make it happen.

825
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:14,240
You...

826
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:17,680
You can't see it.

827
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:20,080
You can't even go in.

828
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,040
That's right.

829
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:27,360
The bedrock TV.

830
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:31,460
It would be an honor.

831
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:33,720
My horse won't be the day.

832
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:35,980
Stop giving the demon.

833
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:37,520
Good ideas.

834
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:39,200
Good ideas.

835
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:44,760
Now put the signs on this air.

836
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:46,060
So they know.

837
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:49,520
The illusion of freedom.

838
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:50,060
Put the...

839
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:52,220
signs here so they know.

840
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:56,420
Don't fuck with Doki Lund.

841
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:00,920
Well, not there.

842
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:01,480
Not there.

843
01:15:01,740 --> 01:15:02,120
No, no, no.

844
01:15:02,420 --> 01:15:02,660
Not there.

845
01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:03,660
Put it on the side.

846
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:05,160
We gotta be able to see it clearly.

847
01:15:05,980 --> 01:15:06,960
Put it on the side, Admin.

848
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:08,380
Not there.

849
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:11,940
Wait, also, put this book in there too.

850
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:19,740
I also put this book in there too.

851
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:20,840
Make a podium.

852
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:23,600
Put this book in the fucking chamber as well.

853
01:15:26,620 --> 01:15:27,580
Here you go.

854
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:29,000
I'll throw the book to you.

855
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:31,120
Put this book in there as well.

856
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:36,840
Hey, Doki.

857
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:39,680
You think I can hold this statue off the balcony?

858
01:15:39,860 --> 01:15:40,780
I think I'll stay a while.

859
01:15:41,060 --> 01:15:41,780
I don't stay a while.

860
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,420
Spin the bottom.

861
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:46,020
Magic, thank you for the super chat that you can take.

862
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:50,680
All right.

863
01:16:00,530 --> 01:16:05,050
Can't even access the history forever preserved.

864
01:16:05,750 --> 01:16:08,330
Now no one can access this history.

865
01:16:12,870 --> 01:16:16,350
This is modern day Tokyo democracy.

866
01:16:16,810 --> 01:16:17,370
You know what?

867
01:16:17,730 --> 01:16:21,150
Edmund, open the server for one second.

868
01:16:27,830 --> 01:16:31,850
Open the server for one second.

869
01:16:39,070 --> 01:16:52,690
Close it, close it, close the server, close it Oh, wait Wait, give one person Access And then close the server

870
01:17:00,540 --> 01:17:12,300
Now close the server I've chosen Alright I've chose El Mexica El Mexicon.

871
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:13,320
Close the server.

872
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:14,280
All right.

873
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:15,700
Put him in.

874
01:17:18,820 --> 01:17:20,400
Put him inside.

875
01:17:32,460 --> 01:17:33,660
That's right.

876
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:38,680
Yeah, all... Yeah, you want to talk now?

877
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:40,500
You want to talk?

878
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:43,160
You want to make a miniature prison.

879
01:17:43,740 --> 01:18:13,820
make a miniature prison around him so he might kill make don't let him make a miniature prison around this guy so you can't move what the fuck is wrong with you yeah you just stay there that's like you're right

880
01:18:18,490 --> 01:18:22,210
Also, set his spawn point inside the prison.

881
01:18:24,890 --> 01:18:30,810
Make sure he can't, he can only, set his spawn point in that prison.

882
01:18:32,470 --> 01:18:34,050
So he can never leave.

883
01:18:38,430 --> 01:18:40,270
That to me will start.

884
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:42,290
Make sure he can't TP.

885
01:18:42,610 --> 01:18:44,890
Revoke his TP rights too.

886
01:18:45,510 --> 01:18:46,970
Revoke his TP rights.

887
01:18:48,310 --> 01:18:50,370
He knows I didn't.

888
01:18:52,510 --> 01:18:53,890
There you go.

889
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:56,720
Make sure he has no TP rights after.

890
01:18:59,110 --> 01:19:02,510
He is in JV prison.

891
01:19:04,550 --> 01:19:07,110
His life isn't over.

892
01:19:07,790 --> 01:19:10,550
Should have thought of that before he said this.

893
01:19:11,810 --> 01:19:12,670
What am I?

894
01:19:13,050 --> 01:19:14,910
Say you're sorry right now.

895
01:19:16,470 --> 01:19:17,330
Apologize.

896
01:19:18,850 --> 01:19:19,710
Apologize.

897
01:19:22,590 --> 01:19:23,310
Apologize.

898
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:32,060

901
01:19:41,620 --> 01:19:45,420

902
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:52,880

Rebook his TP rights too.

904
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:57,280
Give him a...

905
01:19:57,300 --> 01:19:58,920
No, he does not get anything.

906
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,380
He just gets a little prison.

907
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:07,240
Say sorry.

908
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:08,580
Say sorry.

909
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:10,140
It'll all be over.

01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:14,860
Working on removing human rights.

911
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:16,360
No, just try own rights.

912
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:22,320
Wait, how did he get in here?

913
01:20:22,740 --> 01:20:23,600

For this horse.

It's gonna lay with the fishes.

955
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:44,540
Oh, you're not gonna apologize?

956
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:46,040

01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:02,640
Just one simple apology.

961
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:04,580
Over my dead body?

962
01:25:05,060 --> 01:25:07,980
Well, it seems like it'd be over your dead horse's body.

963
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:38,220
Oh look at that Look what I have here Wow Look at that Hmm What can I make with this leather I wonder Oh and I got some I got a saddle too Look at that

Oh you know you could have stopped all of this Oh You could have stopped all of it.

965
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:59,190
If you just said sorry.

966
01:26:00,610 --> 01:26:03,950
Now your only friend is dead and it's all your fault.

967
01:26:05,850 --> 01:26:08,150
Now what have we learned today?

968
01:26:10,390 --> 01:26:12,210
Ironically evil.

969
01:26:17,690 --> 01:26:19,950
What have we learned today?

970
01:26:21,410 --> 01:26:22,450
You fool.

971
01:26:23,190 --> 01:26:25,670
Oh, you know, look at this leather that I wonder.

972
01:26:25,830 --> 01:26:27,950
What can I make with this leather?

973
01:26:28,410 --> 01:26:29,130
I wonder.

974
01:26:29,970 --> 01:26:30,370
Oh.

975
01:26:32,610 --> 01:26:33,650
Let's see.

976
01:26:34,610 --> 01:26:35,390
You know what?

977
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:36,470
Give me a picture.

978
01:26:36,670 --> 01:26:38,410
Actually, no, I have an idea.

979
01:26:38,910 --> 01:26:40,030
I have an idea.

980
01:26:40,350 --> 01:26:42,270
I know what to do with this leather.

981
01:26:48,180 --> 01:26:49,540
Just a little, you know.

982
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:53,020
A little memory.

983
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:04,140
So you can always see what happened to your little friend here.

984
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,940
Oh, and every corner you look.

985
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:19,140
Every corner you look.

986
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:21,080
You'll see a piece of him.

987
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:24,780
You could have stopped this, but you didn't.

988
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:26,940
Isn't that sad?

989
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:31,840
You had every- it was all stopped- you could have stopped it.

990
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:48,040
Every corner you look at, every angle, a piece of your horse is in your view.

991
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:57,040
And you could have stopped all of it.

992
01:27:57,740 --> 01:27:59,580
Now you're gonna die alone.

993
01:28:05,370 --> 01:28:08,130
You can never leave this area.

994
01:28:09,150 --> 01:28:10,110
Just said sorry.

995
01:28:10,330 --> 01:28:13,890
If you just said sorry, none of this would have happened.

996
01:28:19,170 --> 01:28:23,870
Every angle, every place, your dead horse will be there.

997
01:28:25,750 --> 01:28:26,310
You know what?

998
01:28:26,930 --> 01:28:28,850
Admin, take me back to his house.

999
01:28:32,420 --> 01:28:34,440
Take me back to his house, Admin.

1000
01:28:36,460 --> 01:28:39,020

01:31:48,390 --> 01:31:51,670

He could have stopped it.

01:33:20,250 --> 01:33:23,830
He could have stopped the blade from...

1055
01:33:23,850 --> 01:33:24,790
going down.

1056
01:33:25,610 --> 01:33:26,650

1057
01:33:26,970 --> 01:33:28,570
It was his own fault.

That their life is mine.

1065

We don't matter.

1066
01:33:56,180 --> 01:33:56,740
