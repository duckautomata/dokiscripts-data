1
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,720
Wait, where am I?

2
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,820
Oh, there I am!

3
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,400
There I am!

4
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,420
Hello everybody!

5
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,660
Hello, hello!

6
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,580
Another day.

7
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,680
Another day of Marvel Rivals.

8
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,320
Yippee!

9
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,700
God!

10
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,220
I'm sorry to not mean to sound depressed.

11
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,400
Oh my god.

12
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:15,440
Another day of 10, like, late night Marvel Rivals hours.

13
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,480
If I could, I would stream at a decent time for grinding.

14
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,920
I would love to do that.

15
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,580
Today was actually not because I was a Plan Z today.

16
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,760
It was because I actually was doing work stuff.

17
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,020
I was actually being productive.

18
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,100
I was so productive today.

19
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,900
My gosh, New Year, new me everybody.

20
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,840
I cleaned my room.

21
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,120
I had three trash bags that I cleaned up on.

22
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,740
And I threw those trash bags out.

23
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,400
I cleaned my bathroom.

24
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,860
I, like, I actually ordered groceries yesterday night.

25
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,420
Which means I received them today.

26
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,560
Um, and then, um, sorry.

27
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,640
Sorry, immersion.

28
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,340
A little bit of an immersion break right there.

29
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:09,820
And, um, and then so I actually, my fridge is now stocked up.

30
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,800
I vacuumed.

31
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,900
I answered messages.

32
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:19,480
Um, I incurred some late fees because I was late on some stuff.

33
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,600
But I didn't.

34
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,320
I apologize.

35
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,220
I even said I'm very sorry.

36
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,900
I do have a crippling addiction to Marvel Rivals right now.

37
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,820
I am so very sorry.

38
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:34,260
I, I'm so like, I will pay extra because you waited.

39
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,280
I am so sorry.

40
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:49,360
I'm, I'm trying to become a normal human being now.

41
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,500
Um, but I still have a crippling addiction to Marvel Rivals.

42
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:00,820
But that's okay because if I get top 500 today, I will be a little bit better.

43
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:06,600
I think like the closer I get to top 500, the more normal I'm becoming.

44
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:13,400
Like I'm actually slowly like regaining my sensibilities the closer I get to top 500.

45
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,520
Because like, I ordered groceries today.

46
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:20,740
I got groceries today because I'm finally eternity rank.

47
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:26,940
So like, I feel, I feel more and more normal the closer we get to the goal.

48
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,740
Um, uh, Poe, thank you for your one sub.

49
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,200
Thank you, thank you, thank you for the 200 bitties.

50
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,380
Thank you, thank you.

51
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,260
Uh, Killstrike, thank you for the $50 donation.

52
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,420
Thank you, thank you.

53
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,220
I really appreciate it.

54
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,520
So for once, I will warm up one game.

55
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,980
I heard Conquest is a really good like warm-up mode also to level up accounts.

56
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,780
But I also heard Conquest is like infested with bots right now from people who are leveling up their accounts so that they can sell it.

57
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,020
Sell it to people for smurfing.

58
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,700
So, um, so yeah, we'll see how it goes.

59
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:09,160
Yeah, Conquest apparently has a lot of smurfs, bots, hackers, and everything.

60
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,580
Because it's the fastest way to level up an account right now.

61
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,760
I've been on a Psylocke obsession lately.

62
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:24,500
Whenever I have to like, um, play in low elo, I just play Psylocke because it's so easy.

63
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:29,840
I'm gonna say that, and then like, I'm gonna get absolutely shit on in this game mode, um, as Psylocke.

64
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:36,720
Of course, I would like, I would be like, haha, I do so well off-stream playing Psylocke in low- in the lower lobbies.

65
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:44,600
And then, um, and I say that, and then I'm gonna get absolutely fucking destroyed in the- on stream.

66
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,000
Because this always happens to me.

67
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:51,520
I always get destroyed on- whenever I like, feel proud of myself, I get destroyed on stream.

68
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,300
Where the fuck are people?

69
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,140
Where the fuck, please?

70
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,900
Oh my go- Okay.

71
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,220
Okay, yep, there we- there it hap- there it goes.

72
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,880
I- I had a feeling that was gonna happen, guys.

73
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,080
Where the fuck are people?

74
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:17,320
What is he do- is he just beating up the- Oh shit, I was just gonna say, is he literally just beating up the clones?

75
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,400
What the fuck?

76
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:19,800
Like, okay.

77
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:27,560
Alright, Conquest is a lot harder than Ex- Conquest is literally just DPS players absolutely shitting on me.

78
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,080
Um.

79
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,280
I like how this is my warm-up.

80
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,400
Alright, there we go.

81
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,980
This is my warm-up, not playing support.

82
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,780
Who the fu- what are you doing, Gru?

83
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,740
Why would you do this to yourself?

84
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,820
What the fuck?

85
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,380
God, I wanna squish a spider so badly.

86
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,360
Like, why are you playing tank on a DPS game mode?

87
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,800
Like, a support would make more sense.

88
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,040
Oh god.

89
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,100
Oh god.

90
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,000
Yay.

91
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:02,880
Yay.

92
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,440
Oh, I need heals.

93
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,880
Heals, please.

94
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,320
Oh my god.

95
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,800
I wanna fucking squish a spider.

96
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,080
I hate Spider-Man players.

97
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,620
I-

98
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,480
Oh my god, please.

99
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,060
Oh my god.

100
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,780
Where's the support when you need one?

101
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,460
Thank you.

102
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,220
Oh, thank you.

103
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,580
Woo,

104
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,100
goodbye.

105
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,560
What is he gonna do?

106
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,940
Fucking kill our shar- oh, he killed our shark.

107
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,520
Yay, he actually killed our shark, guys.

108
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,420
He did it.

109
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:45,640
Alright.

110
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,040
I'm done with this game mode.

111
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,300
Oh my god, I can't even leave.

112
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,180
I can't even leave this mode.

113
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,800
I - Hate is a strong word.

114
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,080
I absolutely hate spiders now.

115
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,980
I don't care if they're good for the environment.

116
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,740
This game has made me realize like, they don't deserve to live.

117
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,780
They really don't.

118
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,020
Oh my- No!

119
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,180
He flung me out there!

120
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,440
Alright.

121
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,980
Poor spiders.

122
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,000
Sharks too.

123
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,040
Fuck sharks as well.

124
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,680
Let's justify my hate.

125
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,200
There we go.

126
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,740
Jesus Christ.

127
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:33,260
Hello- Oh my god, he just hits- He hits us?

128
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,960
Sharks did nothing wrong.

129
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,380
Oh yeah, explain Jeff.

130
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,420
Explain Jeff.

131
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,200
Jesus Christ, why are you Thor?

132
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,880
What the fuck?

133
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,220
Get me out, get me out.

134
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,760
No, and also raccoons.

135
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,840
No, fuck raccoons too.

136
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,420
You know what?

137
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,640
Okay, I shouldn't say it.

138
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,260
Tell me about all the animals in this world, I guess.

139
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,900
At this point.

140
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,360
Jesus Chri- You know what?

141
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,020
Fuck this.

142
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,820
I don't think I'm gonna kill anybody.

143
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,860
Where did they all just go?

144
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,020
Where did they all go?

145
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,920
Where did everybody go?

146
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,560
Where did they all go?

147
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,520
They all ran.

148
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,860
I'll reclaim these, just in case.

149
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,240
Guys, please, grab the funny orbs.

150
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,350
Please everybody, grab the funny orbs.

151
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,450
Why do you hate raccoons?

152
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,360
Because I hate one tricks.

153
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:50,360
And rocket raccoon support one tricks are absolutely terrible to have in game.

154
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,480
In high elo.

155
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,080
Because there's no point.

156
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:58,120
Okay, I won't do one more game of Psylocke.

157
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,180
That wasn't fun.

158
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,520
That...

159
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,100
That...

160
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:08,760
That wasn't fun.

161
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,300
Slime, thank you for the $10.

162
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,720
Thank you, thank you.

163
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,240
Yeah, the closer you get, the more you take care of yourself.

164
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,280
But the question is, what happens when you finally do reach top 500?

165
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,460
When I finally reach it, I basically...

166
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,480
I just stop existing in this game.

167
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,380
No, are you fucking kidding me?

168
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:30,620
Please!

169
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:30,920
Please!

170
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,460
Why are you playing your lord Psylocke in quick play?

171
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,620
I'm fucking... Okay, I'm gonna...

172
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,140
Last match you might face... Oh my god, this is quick play.

173
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,320
That was literally the only reason.

174
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,580
I need to... I'm gonna look you up on tracker right now.

175
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,680
Give me a sec, guys.

176
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,880
I need to know what your rank is right now.

177
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:04,740
I need to know what your fucking rank is.

178
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:12,500
J-V-S-T-V-I-O-L J-V-S-T-V-I-O-L-E T-T Okay.

179
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,260
I need to find you.

180
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,500
I'm finding you on Marvel Rivals right now.

181
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,000
You better have a public profile.

182
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,680
You better fucking...

183
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,320
Oh my god.

184
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:29,540
I literally queued up just to play Psylocke.

185
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,020
Why the fuck would I...

186
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,940
Oh my god, Marvel Rivals tracker.

187
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,560
They can't wait for me.

188
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,620
They have... Whoa, wait.

189
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,800
I'm fucking... I got you.

190
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,060
I got you.

191
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,120
You're the only diamond three.

192
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,980
Get your... Oh my god.

193
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,640
No one... Oh my god.

194
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,940
I fucking got you.

195
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,680
We don't even need a tank.

196
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,360
I... How petty can you be?

197
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,940
Very petty.

198
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:02,600
I literally only queued up quick play so I can play Psylocke.

199
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,520
I have important matters...

200
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,420
things to do.

201
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,640
I...

202
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,000
Like, grind rank.

203
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,120
I feel attacked.

204
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,780
It's okay.

205
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,480
It's not you.

206
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,740
You're not... You're not just Violet.

207
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:23,520
I literally doxxed this guy's fucking rank profile live on... It's not even doxxing.

208
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,340
It's like public information, guys.

209
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,160
It's...

210
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:29,940
It's...

211
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,200
It's...

212
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,180
His profile is not private.

213
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,420
That means I can look up his gamer profiling.

214
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:43,480
Is it truly doxxing if his profile is not private?

215
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,440
Is it truly live on stream?

216
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,320
Guys, I think like Marvel Rivals made me a hater.

217
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,360
I don't know yet though.

218
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,160
I don't know yet, guys.

219
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,240
But like, I don't know.

220
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,160
Lowkey made me a hater.

221
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,900
You don't understand!

222
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,700
All I wanted to do was play Psylocke on stream.

223
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,340
I don't care about anything else.

224
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,580
I...

225
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,700
It just awakened me in it.

226
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,260
I just wanted to play Psylocke in quick play.

227
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,180
Like, I literally could just have queued rank right now.

228
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,620
I could have just queued rank, guys, but here I am.

229
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,760
Not playing rank.

230
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,060
Here I am.

231
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,580
Doxxing me.

232
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,700
Guys, you don't understand.

233
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,360
I could have been doing it.

234
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,060
I could have been playing support rank right now.

235
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,220
I literally could have been doing that.

236
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,040
What iteration did I come to?

237
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,460
My hate arc.

238
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,000
You're in my hater arc right now.

239
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,900
God, I fucking hate you.

240
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,980
The newspaper was right.

241
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,040
He is a fucking menace to society.

242
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,340
My villain arc.

243
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,220
Alright, come on.

244
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:19,300
How you Lord hella, like, get out.

245
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,040
Alright, fucking goodbye.

246
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:22,940
You know what?

247
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,960
Fuck you guys.

248
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,460
That's right, you cease to exist now.

249
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,540
That's fucking right.

250
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,820
I refuse to let you exist.

251
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,900
This is my home.

252
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,040
Jesus, that's embarrassing for you.

253
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:40,980
Come on.

254
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,720
Get over here.

255
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,360
Yeah, that's right.

256
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,220
Get over here.

257
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,820
Oh, you respawn?

258
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,720
Your shield has a cooldown.

259
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,500
Oh my god.

260
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,560
Don't worry.

261
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,480
I'm just trying to get through this quick play session.

262
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:10,640
I literally only play quick play to play because I wanted to play fucking Psylocke, but here we are playing Oh my god.

263
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,100
Playing Hella instead because I don't want to get this game over with.

264
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,540
And the only way to get this game over with is to play Hella.

265
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,820
Real Hella hours.

266
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,860
Oh my god, you're so embarrassing.

267
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,260
Get off, Cloak.

268
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,520
Don't be so... Don't embarrass the support players.

269
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:39,650
Alright.

270
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:41,990
Waiting until the shield is gone.

271
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:43,390
Ooh, that hurt.

272
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,450
The fuck are you doing, Rocket?

273
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,010
Oh my god!

274
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,170
They actually want to win!

275
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:56,650
You went double support and a double tank in fucking quick play?

276
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,570
We don't even have a singular tank!

277
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,450
What's wrong with you?

278
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:03,550
What's actually...

279
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,630
What's wrong with you?

280
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,850
I can't believe it.

281
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,590
They really want to win.

282
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,830
We don't even have a tank.

283
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:19,130
We don't even have a singular tank in our team.

284
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,590
Oh, that's fine.

285
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,370
That's nice.

286
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,430
The toxic.

287
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:29,130
Get this stranger off my fucking team.

288
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,590
That's right, I'm gonna fly to you.

289
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,550
Okay, I should not flute to you.

290
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:34,610
That's fine.

291
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,250
That's right.

292
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:38,310
Now what you gonna do?

293
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:39,910
Now what you gonna do?

294
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,130
Now what you gonna do?

295
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:43,010
Nothing!

296
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:44,910
Nothing!

297
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,710
Oh my god.

298
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:49,210
Please.

299
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,010
Please.

300
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,930
I just need like one more heal.

301
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,370
That's fine.

302
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,170
Get out of here.

303
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,430
Get out of here.

304
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,570
We don't need a tank.

305
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:03,690
Get...

306
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,090
Get out!

307
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,950
Nope,

308
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,110
I'm still alive.

309
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,590
I'm still alive.

310
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,570
Where's the karma?

311
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,270
No karma.

312
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:21,590
Just MVP.

313
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:25,450
Just hella uninstall Please!

314
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:30,330
I wanted to play Psylocke!

315
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,690
Oh my god.

316
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,670
Holy shit.

317
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:46,210
Bro, I was barely fucking around.

318
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,090
I wasn't even trying to.

319
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:52,830
This is the fourth time I've ever played Hella in my life.

320
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:55,120
I can't believe it.

321
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,330
That was...

322
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:00,950
That was the fourth time I've ever...

323
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,290
Oh my god.

324
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,250
Oh my god.

325
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,670
Jesus Christ.

326
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:12,610
God, bro.

327
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:16,290
Oh my god.

328
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,470
Oh my god.

329
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,050
Fucking quick play, man.

330
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:21,670
Why?

331
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:22,570
Exactly!

332
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,210
Why are you so serious in quick play?

333
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,290
I'm only angry because I couldn't play.

334
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,710
I couldn't play Psylocke in quick play.

335
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:31,030
I literally just wanted to play Psylocke.

336
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:31,790
You know what?

337
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:32,770
Okay, let's see.

338
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:33,330
Are they ready?

339
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,350
No, okay.

340
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,110
Guys, I can play.

341
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,970
I'm going to play Psylocke once.

342
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:37,390
Guys.

343
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:41,410
Guys, I just want to play Psylocke once and then...

344
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,610
And then...

345
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,750
And then we give you a break.

346
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:48,790
Really, that's all I want?

347
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:56,050
Bro, I can't believe our team with no tanks won that.

348
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,310
Like, I can't believe it.

349
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,190
Oh my god.

350
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,190
That's actually crazy.

351
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:04,770
Save, thank you for tier one.

352
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,470
Save slime, inspector.

353
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:07,970
Thank you for tier one sub.

354
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,010
Thank you, thank you.

355
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:11,870
Alright, now I can finally play Psylocke.

356
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,270
I don't know, Psylocke's like super fun.

357
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:17,290
I remember when I first tried to play Psylocke, um...

358
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:22,610
I didn't really enjoy it because I didn't, I did not understand how to play her.

359
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:28,050
But like, right now, like, now that I understand her mechanics, she's really, really fun to play.

360
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,970
Oh my god, we're finally getting our one Psylocke team.

361
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:36,870
I won't be surprised if I get to play Psylocke and I do absolutely fucking terrible.

362
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:39,870
I never, I never get to do well on stream.

363
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:44,330
I can be like absolutely fucking cracked off stream.

364
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:49,370
And then when it's on stream hours, it's like, oh, here's me tripping and falling, everybody.

365
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:53,530
No, fuck Black Panther, I swear to god, I...

366
00:19:54,250 --> 00:20:00,990
There's only, like, like, two people that I know that's really, really good at Black Panther and high ELO.

367
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:05,190
And then they just get target banned because they're just too good.

368
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:12,530
They just, they just get target banned because they're just too good.

369
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,900
All right, whoa, they're playing up.

370
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,060
Wow, that's, that's new.

371
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,000
All right, this group does, actually, this group doesn't know what he's doing.

372
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,940
This group does, definitely does not know what he's doing though.

373
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,420
Okay, I'm gonna go flank now.

374
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,760
I flank.

375
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,380
I flank.

376
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,000
I farmed a little bit of ult.

377
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,060
Now I flank.

378
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,180
Now I flank.

379
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,980
Oh my god, they're healing each other!

380
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:52,880
That's illegal!

381
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,220
My other support barely fucking heals me sometimes!

382
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,220
Like, hey!

383
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,060
That's not fair!

384
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,640
The other support healing each other and, fuck, that's actually not fair!

385
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:07,560
That's...

386
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,800
What, what fucking magical world is this?

387
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,700
Where they actually...

388
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,840
Bro, I'm so... I'm a hater now.

389
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,880
Now you're a hater, Doki!

390
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:28,960
All I'm saying is that it's absolutely crazy that they're getting babysat so hard.

391
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,020
Like, I never had that privilege in ranked.

392
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,100
I rarely, if ever, get that privilege.

393
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,420
I'm so sad.

394
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,760
There you go.

395
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,140
Oh my god, get out of my lobby.

396
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:49,920
There you go.

397
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,520
That's fucking right!

398
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,420
Heal and ult!

399
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,780
That's literally against the rules.

400
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,400
That's fucking right.

401
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,060
Go heal and ult.

402
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,480
Oh my god.

403
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,260
Easy.

404
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,320
How dare they have fun...

405
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,240
If I can't have fun, play support?

406
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,920
Nobody can.

407
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,340
It's just...

408
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,140
It's how it goes.

409
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,620
Woah!

410
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:22,940
Woah!

411
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,780
What's wrong with you?

412
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:26,660
Woah!

413
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,700
What's wrong?

414
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,940
Bro, they actually chased me.

415
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:32,860
That's fine.

416
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,480
I'm fine with that.

417
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,740
I should've juked him.

418
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,460
I didn't think he would actually...

419
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:43,020
You know, I thought he would think I'd go backwards, but then he...

420
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,220
I don't know.

421
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,400
He was like she's definitely gonna go forward and he was right.

422
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,880
He was so right.

423
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,980
Don't worry, I got you.

424
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,180
There you go.

425
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,280
You're welcome.

426
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,880
I did something no other DPS would do.

427
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:57,640
Peel.

428
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,040
It's like an actual privilege.

429
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:02,900
You're welcome.

430
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:03,820
Oh!

431
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,180
I'm just gonna get rid of these clones.

432
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,420
Cause he's right here.

433
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,320
And he doesn't know.

434
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,120
Okay.

435
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,380
He still...

436
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,240
That's awkward.

437
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:25,100
That's actually awkward but...

438
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,020
Whoops!

439
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,100
I woke him up.

440
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,880
I did something that everybody hates.

441
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,160
There we go.

442
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,540
No situational awareness.

443
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,480
That's actually crazy.

444
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,300
Seeing that look.

445
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,740
He literally just walked in a straight line.

446
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:52,660
Like, not caring over the fact that, you know, I exist.

447
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:53,860
There we go.

448
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:54,820
Do they have lamp?

449
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,840
Oh, they're stupid.

450
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,280
His teammate's stupid.

451
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:58,900
That's fine.

452
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:02,260
Woo!

453
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,100
Oh my god!

454
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:05,780
I need help!

455
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:06,720
Stop!

456
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,460
I need help!

457
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,860
Teammate walking away from the lamp.

458
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,560
Yeah, I was just like, yep.

459
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,080
That's fine.

460
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,140
A lot of people don't know I play with a low-key player.

461
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,820
Especially in quick play.

462
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,040
Which is pretty funny.

463
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,260
Yay!

464
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,900
Let me stand here real quick.

465
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,200
Alright.

466
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:32,820
Easiest game of my life.

467
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,600
We have five minutes left?

468
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,680
Holy shit.

469
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,040
What is the other team doing?

470
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,720
I'm just gonna stay on cart.

471
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:39,520
So fuck this.

472
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,460
Let's get this over with.

473
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:41,600
Please.

474
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,700
The Hawkeye is right there.

475
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:44,540
Please.

476
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,600
Oh my god.

477
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,280
I will help.

478
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,520
Oh, get this magic away from me.

479
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,420
I shall stop helping.

480
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,960
One fear.

481
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,040
Alright.

482
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,620
My god!

483
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,200
Stop!

484
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,260
Stop holding hands!

485
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,080
I'd never get that.

486
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,320
Not even in Eternity Ring would people hold my hand.

487
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,140
I'm so sad.

488
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,780
I wish my hand get held too when I get died by 20 million people.

489
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,940
Where would you go?

490
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,200
Where would you go?

491
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,040
Oh, oh, oh.

492
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,980
Yeah, I was gonna say.

493
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,580
Where would you go?

494
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,540
Yeah, they're literally playing.

495
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,740
I hate it.

496
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,840
I hate that they're playing perfectly in quick play.

497
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:37,860
Quick play is unplayable.

498
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:52,020
I'm like, why can't my support players hold my hand when I get died by like two.

499
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,960
When I got died by that fucking Hulk yesterday.

500
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:01,500
Why couldn't my support player hold my hand when I kept getting slapped by the fucking Hulk.

501
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:08,920
I don't understand how could quick play players like support each other more than Eternity players.

502
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,160
It's just not fair.

503
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,400
It really is not.

504
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,340
Alright, now I'm ready for rank.

505
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,720
I got my hate out.

506
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:19,120
So like, I should be ready to go.

507
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:28,500
As long as me watching the W key Hulk walk past my entire team to beat my ass.

508
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:34,200
It doesn't... I hate to break it to you, but it doesn't change the higher you go.

509
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:41,300
It's still the same.

510
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,520
Where's Mac?

511
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,020
Oh my god.

512
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,220
I don't think Mac realized.

513
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,120
Do we wait?

514
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,500
Okay.

515
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,080
Wait.

516
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,240
Do we wait for you?

517
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,080
Or...

518
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,540
Or we queue one up?

519
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:02,680
I don't think... I don't think he got my message earlier.

520
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,000
I don't...

521
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,380
I don't think he got it earlier.

522
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,340
Unity, thank you for the Twitch prom.

523
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,060
Thank you, thank you.

524
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,200
Ghost, thank you for tier one.

525
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,080
Thank you, thank you.

526
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,800
Slime, thank you for the donation.

527
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,360
Thank you, thank you.

528
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,080
Now you're a hater?

529
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,300
Are you sure it's not your old hate waking up because you're playing?

530
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,720
It could be that too.

531
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,660
Oh my god, am I the only Trinity player?

532
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,160
Oh my god, I swear to god.

533
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,980
I'm gonna lose so much.

534
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,500
Oh my god.

535
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,240
I thought we were gonna wait for Mac.

536
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,780
I didn't even know we queued up.

537
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,280
Holy shit.

538
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,220
Alright, we'll see how this goes.

539
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,700
I hope this doesn't go terribly wrong.

540
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,880
I'm gonna ban Bruce Banner because fuck that.

541
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,380
After my random about Hulk, I'm gonna ban Bruce Banner.

542
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,100
Oh my god, not my rank roins.

543
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,700
Not my fucking rank roins.

544
00:27:55,140 --> 00:28:03,340
Also, like, whatever happens today, I won't be streaming Marble Rivals tomorrow because my left hand is starting to feel a little cramped.

545
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,080
I've been stretching it but like, I play with my keyboard angled.

546
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:18,520
Angled a little bit, so it's not really like the best position for like No, it's not my wrist, it's my fingers.

547
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:30,500
So like, my finger that's on the W and D is like a little cramped, like it's a little crampy so like I'm gonna rest tomorrow.

548
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,560
How do I angle it?

549
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,100
I angle it to like it's like facing, it's like a little to the left.

550
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,960
Alright, Tony Florida.

551
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:43,300
I'll do Mantis.

552
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:47,560
Yeah, also let me know, I adjusted the sound a bit so that voice chat is a little louder.

553
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:52,980
So like, let me know if it's better or or not.

554
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,920
Cause like, I don't know if it's like, if it is better or not.

555
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:05,680
Yeah, so like, and I've been So like, I think it's, I've been playing a lot of Marble Rivals and I think finally it's caught up.

556
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:16,080
Remember to always do your stretches if you're planning on playing long sessions of long sessions of Marble Rivals or like FPS games.

557
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:21,100
But like, surprisingly my right hand is okay.

558
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,740
My right hand is okay.

559
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:26,860
It's literally like one, two fingers that are feeling sore.

560
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:35,300
Because I play on a very weird angle when it comes to when it comes to shooter games.

561
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:41,340
Alright, let's try Alright, let's hope things will be okay.

562
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,480
Let's hope things will be okay.

563
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,460
I'm so confident.

564
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,560
I am so confident.

565
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,880
First game non-Luna.

566
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:52,940
Let's go.

567
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,340
Alright, damage boost.

568
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,760
Oh my god, that's a lot of low keys.

569
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,300
But that means I can farm.

570
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,040
I can farm some headshots.

571
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,560
Ooh.

572
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,160
Wait, did we...

573
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:09,980
Oh.

574
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,300
Okay, nice.

575
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:13,840
We got him.

576
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:18,340
I usually try to aim the sleep on... Oh my god.

577
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:22,440
I try to aim the sleep on the ground for like the most efficiency.

578
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,740
You know what?

579
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,460
Let's get rid of this so I can farm some leaves.

580
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,000
There you go.

581
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:33,500
Nice.

582
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,700
Oh my god, Floga, let's go.

583
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,100
Do your thing, Flo.

584
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:39,740
Yeah.

585
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,280
Oh my god.

586
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,340
Why are you all so low?

587
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:48,200
What is going on over there?

588
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,020
Okay, okay.

589
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,220
I got a little worried there.

590
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,520
Like, who are you fighting?

591
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,060
Who are you fighting?

592
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,420
Is he still alive?

593
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,420
Oh my god, he was.

594
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,300
He actually...

595
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,080
Guys, guys.

596
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,060
I don't like that he's still alive.

597
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:05,740
Okay.

598
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,260
And...

599
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,660
He's still alive.

600
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,280
Alright, that's cool.

601
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,520
How is he still alive?

602
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,200
How is he still alive?

603
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,220
Oh my god.

604
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,740
Yes, I have the ult.

605
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:24,420
Okay.

606
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,800
Oh my... We're gonna have Starlord ult here.

607
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,680
Oh my god, what the fuck is going on?

608
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,520
Please!

609
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,160
He's literally 1 HP!

610
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,960
I swear to god!

611
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,900
They have strange and Starlord ult.

612
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:49,620
Guys, please.

613
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,320
We have no defensive ult for that.

614
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,800
Oh my god!

615
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:57,680
Like, the ult.

616
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,360
I feel like...

617
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,180
I'm dead.

618
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:01,780
Oh my god.

619
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,920
No.

620
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,020
Goodbye.

621
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,640
This is where I die.

622
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,900
This is where I die.

623
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,040
How is he still...

624
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:13,960
I don't understand!

625
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,740
I don't understand how he's still...

626
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,540
I think we just died on point.

627
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:22,200
I don't understand how he's still alive.

628
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,780
How did nobody kill him?

629
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,380
Oh my god.

630
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,480
I literally got him one too.

631
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,500
That's like the worst part.

632
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,700
Oh, I'm not gonna peek anymore.

633
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,600
I'm not gonna peek anymore.

634
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,240
I'm gonna farm the leaves right here though.

635
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,400
Oh my god, I missed the dash.

636
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,120
Oh my god.

637
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:50,880
Please!

638
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:52,960
We need...

639
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,560
We need...

640
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,060
We're down two supports.

641
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,420
We need peel from Panther.

642
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,520
We grew up to two!

643
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,580
Please, we need like one little peel.

644
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,380
That's all.

645
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,060
Oh my god.

646
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,780
Please, I need somebody to come back to help me.

647
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,520
Oh my god.

648
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,040
I lived.

649
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,360
Oh my god.

650
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,640
Why did nobody help me?

651
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,900
Why did no one help me when I got pulled?

652
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,080
He's like, no!

653
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,640
Why?

654
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,760
Why did you hit him?

655
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:37,640
Why?

656
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,720
That was lit.

657
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,700
Oh my god.

658
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:46,380
Push with this.

659
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,220
Starlord won.

660
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,280
Oh my god.

661
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:56,180
Please.

662
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:57,560
Oh my god.

663
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,640
I didn't mean it.

664
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,500
Black Panther behind me.

665
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,500
Oh my god.

666
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,920
Please, for the love of god, just kill him.

667
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,320
Just actually kill him.

668
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,400
Oh my god.

669
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,340
There's spider on me.

670
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,180
Spider is asleep above.

671
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:16,500
Siren is one.

672
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,080
Siren is one.

673
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,720
Oh my god.

674
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,400
Please.

675
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,160
Holy shit.

676
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,620
He's low.

677
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,160
He's low.

678
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:27,700
He's low.

679
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:28,280
He's real low.

680
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,340
Oh, I can't peek.

681
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,580
Doctor Strange.

682
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,060
Oh, Panther one.

683
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:37,560
Panther one.

684
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,960
Oh my god.

685
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:40,300
Please.

686
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:41,960
Oh.

687
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:44,680
Let's go.

688
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,300
Yeah, baby.

689
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,940
Oh my god.

690
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,780
That shit was crazy.

691
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,700
Yeah, let's fucking go.

692
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,780
Oh my god.

693
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,580
I have to think.

694
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:57,800
Oh my god.

695
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,880
Oh yeah, can somebody edit the command?

696
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,140
Yeah, the fucking.

697
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,220
Oh my god.

698
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,440
Also, I'm like, thank you for the raid.

699
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:06,860
Thank you.

700
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:07,680
Thank you.

701
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,640
Thank you for enabling my Marble Rivals addiction.

702
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,760
I really appreciate it.

703
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:12,440
Hello, everybody.

704
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,560
My name is Doki Bird.

705
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:19,200
I usually stream on the YouTubes but today I'm here on Marble Rivals because I want to see if I can get top 500 today.

706
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,840
I need to basically win six games but like.

707
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,260
I don't know about that.

708
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,560
Oh yes, check me out on YouTube.

709
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,580
Enjoy my content.

710
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:36,300
I forgot to get a cough drop too.

711
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,280
I need to get a cough drop.

712
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,460
I don't know why.

713
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,520
I'm like okay until like I started.

714
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,820
I was totally.

715
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,560
My voice was so okay throughout the day.

716
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,540
It's just like, there's something.

717
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:49,040
There was just too much hate, I guess.

718
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,820
Alright, damage boosted.

719
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,420
It'll be fine.

720
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,880
Damage boosted again.

721
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:54,920
It'll be so fine.

722
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,400
Nice!

723
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:00,460
We're up two.

724
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:00,740
We're up two.

725
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,260
We should push up.

726
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:10,560
Wolverine?

727
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:10,800
Wolf?

728
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:10,940
Wolf?

729
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:11,760
One's one.

730
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,300
Is he okay?

731
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,540
Wait, I remember Tony Florida!

732
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,640
He said a slur!

733
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,760
I got him in a game before he died.

734
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,200
Now I remember who he was.

735
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,640
No, I remember.

736
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,800
It was a long time ago.

737
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,200
It was when I was still in Diamond.

738
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:40,160
But like, he was not a very happy fellow.

739
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,180
Let me tell you that.

740
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:46,660
He was not a very happy person.

741
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,900
I'm ulting this.

742
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,060
Black Panther to your left.

743
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:57,350
Strange one.

744
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:58,010
Strange half.

745
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:00,350
Alright.

746
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,270
I don't know.

747
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:08,190
Maybe he got better.

748
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:10,130
Maybe he's like, more reformed.

749
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,790
Now that he's in GM1.

750
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:13,710
He's looking for a strange ult.

751
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:17,490
I am Groot.

752
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,270
They're gonna strange ult after this.

753
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:31,510
Black Panther to your left.

754
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:33,250
Black Panther one.

755
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:33,910
Black Panther's one.

756
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,550
That's literally the only thing I remember.

757
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:42,750
You're fine.

758
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:43,110
You're fine.

759
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:47,650
Oh my god.

760
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:49,330
He's so healthy.

761
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:52,510
I gave him all my fucking leaves.

762
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:56,290
Do something with my leaves.

763
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:58,090
Jesus Christ.

764
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:58,550
Black Panther.

765
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:02,790
I think we should just die on point.

766
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:06,190
Don't use anything.

767
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:07,910
Okay.

768
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:10,310
He used stuff.

769
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:10,810
Guys.

770
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:13,890
Oh my god.

771
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:20,170
I love it when I say don't use anything and then we're just like, you know what?

772
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:20,690
Fuck it.

773
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:22,230
Just one would be funny.

774
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:24,490
Wouldn't it be funny if we just used one though?

775
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:29,870
But like, just one.

776
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:32,530
Jesus Christ.

777
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,510
I'm ulting with this.

778
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:34,870
Let's push.

779
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:41,090
Strange half.

780
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:41,490
Strange half.

781
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:44,970
Oh my god.

782
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:49,050
Black Panther behind us.

783
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,170
Oh nice.

784
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:52,750
Nice, we did it.

785
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:54,430
Oh my god.

786
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:57,730
Oh, we did it.

787
00:38:58,490 --> 00:38:58,750
Alright.

788
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:03,770
Yay.

789
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:11,010
And he didn't go full toxic.

790
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:11,870
Let's go.

791
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,110
He didn't go.

792
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:15,690
I'm pretty sure he got better.

793
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,130
It was Diamond.

794
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:19,570
It was him when he was Diamond.

795
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:22,230
So like, I'm pretty sure he like...

796
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,170
He like, got better.

797
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:29,510
I'm pretty sure.

798
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:31,350
He's GM1 now.

799
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:32,910
He's a new him, you know?

800
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:33,670
New Rake.

801
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:34,590
New him.

802
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:37,790
Let's check if he's ready.

803
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:41,790
Yeah, Diamond Diamond is just a different world, you know?

804
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,410
It's a different world.

805
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:44,990
I was like, why is he...

806
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:46,610
I was like, oh my god, why do I like...

807
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:48,310
Oh my god, he queued up another...

808
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:50,790
I think he didn't see my...

809
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:53,950
I don't think he saw my message.

810
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:56,050
Okay.

811
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,810
Oh my god.

812
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:08,750
Apparently, Zexro was top 100 and now he's GM...

813
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:09,730
Wait, what?

814
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:12,310
Wait, is that actually like, a person?

815
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,990
I'm sorry, I mean like...

816
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:18,910
I'm sorry, that sounded really bad.

817
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,750
I meant more like...

818
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,390
Oh my god!

819
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:25,690
Oh my god, we did raked him!

820
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,280
Oh my god!

821
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,600
Oh my god!

822
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,660
That's an un-void right there, I'm sorry man.

823
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,120
You're not having a good day.

824
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:44,600
I'm sorry, but like, I can't have that in my game.

825
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,960
Oh my god.

826
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,120
Oh my god.

827
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,460
Oh my god, I'm sorry.

828
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,700
I'm sorry, that's so...

829
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,580
That's...

830
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,380
Oh, yeah.

831
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:03,000
He's like, oh, he's like one of the best Fortnite players in the world.

832
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,580
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

833
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,620
You're not having a good day today.

834
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,080
I'm so sorry, buddy.

835
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:14,920
It's not you.

836
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:15,960
It's your elo, right?

837
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,480
It's your elo right now.

838
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:20,040
It's literally, it's not you.

839
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,140
Oh my god.

840
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,460
You're gonna kick him when he...

841
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:29,300
No, I'm saying is that I do not want that on my games, guys.

842
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,860
I do not want that in my elo.

843
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,900
I'm sorry, Zexor.

844
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:36,600
I bet you're an insane Fortnite player.

845
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,200
But like, I'm so sorry.

846
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,420
This is...

847
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,320
We literally deranked you.

848
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,720
I'm so fucking sorry.

849
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,100
Oh my god.

850
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,760
Oh my god.

851
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,320
I hope...

852
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,560
Oh, this is...

853
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:01,040
He started the new year on a lost streak.

854
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,500
Buddy, I'm sorry.

855
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,020
Oh my god.

856
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,640
Oh.

857
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,220
I'm sorry.

858
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,500
I hope...

859
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,120
I hope you're okay.

860
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,640
I hope...

861
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,200
I hope you're okay, buddy.

862
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,580
That's rough.

863
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:22,500
That's so fucking rough.

864
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:29,310
While he was on my team.

865
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
At least you know now, Libra.

866
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,400
At least...

867
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,660
At least you know.

868
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,740
Guys, his luck will turn around.

869
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,900
When you hit a certain loss, you...

870
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,480
It goes all the way around.

871
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,620
Truly, right?

872
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,440
Truly, it can't be that bad.

873
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:49,400
Truly.

874
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,880
We all have our lost streaks, guys.

875
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,740
We all have our lost streaks.

876
00:42:58,860 --> 00:42:59,800
It's okay.

877
00:42:59,800 --> 00:42:59,900
It's okay.

878
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:01,780
That's alright.

879
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,180
Oh, he's doom queuing.

880
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:05,800
I...

881
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,960
This game, like, does something to you.

882
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,000
I would get people asking me...

883
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,220
Like, I would play it off stream.

884
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:15,880
And they're like, why are you not streaming this?

885
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,700
And I literally tell them, I'm doom queuing.

886
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,260
And then they're like, oh.

887
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:24,100
It's just like...

888
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,840
They're just like, that's not great news.

889
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,040
But, like...

890
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,220
I'm gonna lie.

891
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,160
Soda, thank you for the raid.

892
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,220
Thank you, I really appreciate it.

893
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:36,920
Hello, everybody.

894
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,080
My name is Doki Braid.

895
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:40,700
And I stream on YouTube.

896
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:44,500
But I'm currently streaming my Marvel Rivals rank grind on Twitch.

897
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,460
Because I don't know how long it's gonna fucking take me.

898
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,780
And also, like, I don't know whenever I...

899
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,720
It's always random whenever I do stream.

900
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,580
On Marvel Rivals.

901
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,340
Because it's mostly me just trying to find people.

902
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,820
To play with.

903
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:02,040
But yes, doom queuing is basically when you're on a lost streak, but you're still going.

904
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,440
So, um...

905
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,760
You just don't stop queuing.

906
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:10,120
And you're a little tilted, just a little bit tilted, but you don't care.

907
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:13,440
You're like, in your head, you're like, it'll get better.

908
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,260
It'll get better eventually, right?

909
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:20,560
At some point, the winner's queue is gonna kick in.

910
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:21,540
Right, guys?

911
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:22,440
Right?

912
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:23,720
I'll stop right back.

913
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,720
I need to go get a cough drop and more water.

914
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,120
I'll be right back.

915
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:00,460
Oh, Ruckus!

916
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,620
That's the Overwatch Ruckus.

917
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,900
He literally came back from Overwatch and Valorant.

918
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:06,680
Whoa!

919
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:08,420
That's crazy.

920
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,680
Seeing Ruckus again.

921
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:10,660
From Overwatch.

922
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,080
Oh, alright.

923
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:13,960
I can play Adam.

924
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:14,700
That's fine.

925
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:22,690
Bro, you're not even a fucking...

926
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:23,550
What?!

927
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:25,850
You're a strange...

928
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:26,290
Okay.

929
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:29,290
Bro, this guy didn't even have...

930
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:32,970
This guy didn't even have, like, a Luna hero portrait.

931
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:34,570
Or lord, whatever.

932
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,920
I was like, why did you pick Luna?

933
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:41,820
Why?

934
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,050
I'm banning Bruce Banner.

935
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:50,190
I don't care what they say.

936
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:51,550
I'm banning Bruce.

937
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:54,330
I don't care if you're a fucking Hulk one trick.

938
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:55,830
I don't want them in my lobby.

939
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:00,730
I do not want them in my lobby.

940
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:06,070
He was the one arguing with Bong the other day.

941
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:08,310
I have...

942
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:10,270
I play so much.

943
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:15,950
I play so much Marvel Rivals that I don't know.

944
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:20,290
I have no idea.

945
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:24,430
Alright.

946
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:28,490
Ruckus was an Overwatch League support player.

947
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:33,600
I'm doing it.

948
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,360
That's basically who Ruckus was.

949
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,180
And I think he moved to Valorant.

950
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:46,100
Yeah, I'd rather play against a Hella than Hulk because Hulk at least doesn't fucking walk through five people and then slaps me.

951
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:47,980
Like...

952
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,700
Like, at least I don't have to deal with that.

953
00:46:52,300 --> 00:47:01,200
Like, I would like, at least like Hella at least I get from Hella I get shot from 200 miles away, but like at least that takes skill.

954
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:06,280
Like, at least at least getting killed by a Hella takes skill.

955
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:11,140
Getting killed by a Hulk is just my team being fucking blind.

956
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:12,820
Like...

957
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:16,600
It's just my team.

958
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:20,320
Like, I don't know, need to get a fucking eye test or some shit.

959
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:28,300
I could die of PTSD because I could be like my team's fucking stupid if I die to a Hulk.

960
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:32,380
Damn.

961
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:34,420
I'd rather die to Hella.

962
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,320
Ooh, no more.

963
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:39,400
Nice.

964
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,540
Oh, not nice.

965
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:44,960
He's fine.

966
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:45,980
He's so fine.

967
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,080
He's so healthy.

968
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:52,960
Oh.

969
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:58,000
There's no more up top.

970
00:47:58,140 --> 00:47:58,480
High ground.

971
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:03,360
I got him.

972
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:05,280
I'll kill no more.

973
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:06,840
My son!

974
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,220
There's a Wolverine coming.

975
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,120
Ooh, we can't get you.

976
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,360
Oh no, you got walled off.

977
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:17,840
That was an insane wall though.

978
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:18,380
Not gonna lie.

979
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:19,060
Oh, you're walled off.

980
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:19,280
Strange.

981
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:24,640
Jesus Christ.

982
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:25,560
You're walled off again.

983
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:27,660
Oh, Grit's low.

984
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:28,040
Grit's one.

985
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:28,440
Grit's one.

986
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:29,620
Grit's still low.

987
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,940
Um, you can mantis ult first if you have it.

988
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:37,200
Alright.

989
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:39,760
We're taking no team damage.

990
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,500
Oh my god.

991
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:47,590
Please.

992
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:51,010
Okay.

993
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:53,030
Alright.

994
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:53,330
Alright.

995
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:56,770
Where's our tank?

996
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:03,190
I'm just like where's our tank?

997
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:04,830
Where did he go?

998
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:10,450
Oh.

999
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:11,550
He's low.

1000
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:11,710
He's low.

1001
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:12,150
Yeah, that's nice.

1002
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:14,070
I'm on Grit.

1003
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:14,730
Grit's half.

1004
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:15,150
Grit's one.

1005
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:17,730
Alright, that's fine.

1006
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:21,070
That's... we're fine.

1007
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:22,530
Yeah.

1008
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:25,070
Yeah, he used it.

1009
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:25,670
He used it.

1010
00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:28,490
They should have Hella and Wolf ult.

1011
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:34,060
Jesus Christ.

1012
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,780
Please, I have to reload my hands.

1013
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:36,920
It's not limited.

1014
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,320
It's by what you think.

1015
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:44,320
Alright, there we go.

1016
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:46,160
No, I've been desperate.

1017
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:48,580
I realized I started climbing when I started talking.

1018
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:51,940
And I got desperate.

1019
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:58,660
I can't see you guys.

1020
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,200
I'm ulting, I'm ulting.

1021
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:03,380
I'm ulting on point.

1022
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,300
Dyna's boosting now.

1023
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:11,500
Dance, everybody!

1024
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:12,960
Dance!

1025
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:13,960
There we go.

1026
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:14,380
We're fine.

1027
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:16,680
There's somebody on top, right?

1028
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:17,980
Unless you're dead.

1029
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:22,760
Goodbye.

1030
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:23,480
Goodbye, Punisher.

1031
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:25,420
Goodbye.

1032
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:29,960
Oh my god.

1033
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,760
They should still have Hella ult.

1034
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,280
And their support ults.

1035
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:37,300
Oh my god!

1036
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:38,840
Poki, thank you for the raid!

1037
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:39,660
Thank you, thank you!

1038
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,980
I really appreciate it.

1039
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:44,500
Oh my god, please, please, please.

1040
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:45,580
Please!

1041
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:45,660
Please!

1042
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:48,800
You're taking so much damage!

1043
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:50,160
Oh my god!

1044
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:52,500
Please don't shift.

1045
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:53,900
Oh, that's a huge ult!

1046
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,360
I ult first.

1047
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,140
We're up one.

1048
00:50:59,320 --> 00:50:59,980
We're up one.

1049
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:03,180
I can heal one.

1050
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:06,980
Oh, I'm just gonna push this turret.

1051
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:10,020
I don't have Luna ult yet.

1052
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,180
Oh my god.

1053
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:16,300
Oh my god.

1054
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:16,700
It's fine.

1055
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:17,520
What?

1056
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:18,640
Who shot me?

1057
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:22,700
Oh, I need to be top off real quick.

1058
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:25,400
Oh god.

1059
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:26,220
Please.

1060
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:28,620
Where's our Mantis?

1061
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:29,940
Oh, thank you!

1062
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:32,320
Oh.

1063
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:33,400
Well.

1064
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,680
We lost a lot of people there.

1065
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:38,780
Hahaha!

1066
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,600
Oh, that's awkward.

1067
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:42,440
They have Bucky ult here.

1068
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,800
Um, I might be able to have ult for it.

1069
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:50,800
Please.

1070
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,260
Oh my god!

1071
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,340
Oh my god!

1072
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,680
Okay, I have ult for Bucky.

1073
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:01,800
Okay.

1074
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,040
Okay.

1075
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:05,920
Okay.

1076
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:06,520
Okay.

1077
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:10,440
Okay, I'm fucking, I'm swimming a little bit.

1078
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:11,240
Okay.

1079
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:13,900
That's awkward.

1080
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:14,560
Down one.

1081
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:19,760
Oh, I don't see you, Mantis.

1082
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:24,280
Oh.

1083
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:28,940
Oh, hell is behind us!

1084
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:29,340
Hell is behind!

1085
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:31,500
No!

1086
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:34,100
Mantis!

1087
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,580
I couldn't heal you!

1088
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:40,300
It's okay.

1089
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:42,220
We still have three minutes of this.

1090
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:45,320
Surely we won't get full held down here.

1091
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:46,980
At the fucking finish line.

1092
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:47,880
Please.

1093
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:49,940
Please let us heal you.

1094
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:51,000
Please!

1095
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,820
You're our only tank!

1096
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:56,140
That's all I ask!

1097
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:57,440
Please!

1098
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:57,740
Okay.

1099
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:02,220
You cannot die.

1100
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,640
Oh, I need to get topped off.

1101
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:05,120
Thank you.

1102
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:06,300
Please!

1103
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,100
I will start clapping!

1104
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:09,340
You're in the line!

1105
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:10,520
You're in the line!

1106
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,280
Okay, there we go.

1107
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:13,920
There we go.

1108
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:15,780
They're in a line so I can start clapping.

1109
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:19,440
That's like the best thing for me.

1110
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:21,620
Okay, we got another tank.

1111
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:26,520
We finally got another tank!

1112
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,200
Oh my god!

1113
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,240
Oh my god!

1114
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:33,420
Oh my god!

1115
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:36,760
I don't know how the fuck they lived through all that.

1116
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,680
But good job everybody!

1117
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:42,520
I can't use any of my ults because like...

1118
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,560
Okay, okay.

1119
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:45,960
I'm ulting.

1120
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:48,240
Alright, let's go.

1121
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:50,600
Okay!

1122
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:52,580
That's fine, that's fine, that's fine.

1123
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:53,860
Play near cart if you can.

1124
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:53,900
Play near cart if you can.

1125
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:00,580
I might die to hello.

1126
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:04,260
I can't sacrifice myself!

1127
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:08,000
Oh my god!

1128
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:09,180
No!

1129
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:12,720
He got healed!

1130
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,960
Oh my god, please!

1131
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:18,380
Please!

1132
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:25,460
Oh my god, you guys are all low and I have to clap.

1133
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:28,080
Do I have to clap?

1134
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:33,660
Hella to the right, hella to the right.

1135
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,340
They're gonna have strange ult for this.

1136
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,020
Oh, there it is.

1137
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,140
Strange one, strange one, strange one!

1138
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:49,980
Magnio, Magnio's on cart.

1139
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:54,840
Yippee!

1140
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:57,160
Oh, please don't touch the cart.

1141
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,040
Please, please.

1142
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,520
That sleep was crazy!

1143
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:02,460
I like how I was like, goodbye!

1144
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:03,980
Oh, there we go.

1145
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:08,640
It was an incredibly huge eye.

1146
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:12,420
But like, the enemy team didn't push up for some fucking reason.

1147
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:14,440
His team was like, that's pretty cool!

1148
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,160
And then they just...

1149
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,320
They just let him die, I guess.

1150
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:18,820
They...

1151
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:21,400
I don't know why.

1152
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:25,860
I don't know why the enemy team watched him get like a five man eye.

1153
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:34,120
They're just like, that's really cool!

1154
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:39,460
Watches, yeah.

1155
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,380
Awesome job, Strange!

1156
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:45,380
Wish we could do something about it as I watch like, five miles away.

1157
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:49,900
Dude, get him!

1158
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:54,120
Bro, I would not be surprised if the Strange was like, I just got... It's huge!

1159
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:54,760
It's huge!

1160
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:55,900
Where are you guys?

1161
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,120
Where is my team?

1162
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:02,960
I would not be surprised if that was the comms on the enemy team.

1163
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:05,580
I went to Doki-Loki.

1164
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:06,920
She's fucking dead.

1165
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,560
I mean, to be fair, people are learning how to play Loki now.

1166
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:10,840
Optimally.

1167
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,180
So there's so many like, Loki one-tricks now in this ELO.

1168
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:18,540
I don't know how to play Loki in Eternity Ring, because it's actually crazy.

1169
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:22,220
They would go, they use the invisible to like, flank.

1170
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:37,520
Instead of like, using it as an escape, a good Loki player, I've noticed, they would use the Loki invisibility to literally just like, go invisible and then un-viz and like, put a clone in front of them and just get a kill from it.

1171
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,400
I've been watching like, pro Loki players do that.

1172
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:41,540
It's actually so scary.

1173
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:50,000
It's so scary and like, and it's like, it's like mind game shit.

1174
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,620
Jesus Christ!

1175
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:52,620
How?

1176
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:56,140
I looked away for literally one second.

1177
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,720
Oh, you're by yourself.

1178
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:01,000
Oh, tank.

1179
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:02,220
Oh my god.

1180
00:57:05,850 --> 00:57:07,030
Oh my god.

1181
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:08,750
Oh, you're blocked off.

1182
00:57:08,810 --> 00:57:09,210
You're walled off.

1183
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:12,530
Oh my god.

1184
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:13,730
I need to use you for heals.

1185
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:15,770
I need to use you for heals.

1186
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:17,190
I...

1187
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:19,550
Yeah, just wait for me.

1188
00:57:24,370 --> 00:57:25,530
Oh my god.

1189
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:29,010
I don't know how, I'm gonna orb the Magneto.

1190
00:57:30,830 --> 00:57:32,690
I'm gonna orb the Magneto right there.

1191
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:36,830
Jesus Christ.

1192
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:41,960
Oh, Grit's one!

1193
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:42,360
Grit's one!

1194
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:47,200
Jesus.

1195
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:49,160
I'm trying my best.

1196
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:54,580
There's a Moon Knight on the right.

1197
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:56,920
Oh, they double support ulted.

1198
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:57,180
Oh.

1199
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:03,720
How?

1200
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:14,330
Jesus Christ.

1201
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:17,210
I'm gonna Luna ult to stabilize.

1202
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:19,350
Yeah.

1203
00:58:20,350 --> 00:58:21,150
It's fine.

1204
00:58:22,330 --> 00:58:23,850
Oh, you guys gotta get out of there.

1205
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:28,990
Nice, there's someone behind us.

1206
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:30,210
Moon Knight behind.

1207
00:58:30,270 --> 00:58:30,810
Moon Knight behind.

1208
00:58:34,490 --> 00:58:35,410
Mantis behind us.

1209
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:36,110
Mantis low.

1210
00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:40,370
How did we live that?

1211
00:58:42,370 --> 00:58:43,970
What the fuck?

1212
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:46,230
I don't know how the fuck we...

1213
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:47,410
That was...

1214
00:58:47,410 --> 00:58:49,350
That was three ults.

1215
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:52,050
They used everything but health.

1216
00:58:55,730 --> 00:58:57,230
How the fuck?

1217
00:58:57,570 --> 00:58:59,270
I'm just surprised we lived that.

1218
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:00,690
Oh my god, stupid ghost.

1219
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:12,510
Oh, I'm clapping just in case because I don't know if they're gonna walk in a straight line.

1220
00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:16,930
Mantis is half.

1221
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:18,050
There's a Hela behind us.

1222
00:59:18,870 --> 00:59:19,750
Hela's behind us.

1223
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:23,310
I cannot really peek.

1224
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:31,120
Hela's low.

1225
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:32,180
Got Hela.

1226
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:35,000
Hela's half.

1227
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:37,340
Do not stop pushing.

1228
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:40,940
Oh my god.

1229
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:43,260
Clap, clap, clap, clap, live!

1230
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:50,700
They have strange...

1231
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:53,160
Actually, they have Groot, Moon Hul here.

1232
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,360
If they combo it, you won't live through Luna.

1233
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:09,250
We're fine,

1234
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:12,410
right?

1235
01:00:15,130 --> 01:00:16,630
We're so fine.

1236
01:00:17,790 --> 01:00:19,290
Oh, Groot's low, Groot's half, Groot's one.

1237
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:24,310
Oh my god.

1238
01:00:25,710 --> 01:00:27,910
Everything is so healthy!

1239
01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:31,630
We're so okay!

1240
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:33,750
Oh my god!

1241
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:40,090
Until they do a Groot, Moon Knight combo, then like, things won't be that great to be fair.

1242
01:00:40,490 --> 01:00:44,210
Things won't be as healthy anymore, which is a little scary.

1243
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:49,790
Careful of the Groot, Moon Knight combo.

1244
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:54,950
What?

1245
01:00:55,370 --> 01:00:56,470
Oh, shit!

1246
01:00:56,630 --> 01:00:56,930
Okay.

1247
01:00:59,470 --> 01:01:00,110
What?

1248
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:03,010
Okay, okay.

1249
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:07,550
Watch me?

1250
01:01:07,770 --> 01:01:08,110
Okay.

1251
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:14,150
Oh, I don't want to group up because of the Moon Knight.

1252
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:14,310
Okay.

1253
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:18,770
Nice.

1254
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:24,270
I was so confused because, like, he was alive.

1255
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:27,470
I was like, wait.

1256
01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:30,130
How was he alive?

1257
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:32,090
Let me reload.

1258
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:33,610
I reloaded my hand.

1259
01:01:35,970 --> 01:01:36,770
Oh, nice.

1260
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:42,650
I don't want to be too close because I know they're going to... I'm worried that he's going to Groot ult.

1261
01:01:43,610 --> 01:01:45,370
That's like my number one fear.

1262
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:47,670
I think he's waiting for Groot ult right here.

1263
01:01:50,370 --> 01:01:50,910
Point, Groot, point.

1264
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:53,190
Please.

1265
01:01:54,230 --> 01:01:54,710
Nice.

1266
01:01:55,650 --> 01:01:57,150
What is he waiting for?

1267
01:01:58,290 --> 01:02:00,970
He's waiting for me to put on a show.

1268
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:05,750
I'm going to let you farm your ult for Mantis.

1269
01:02:07,870 --> 01:02:09,230
Yeah, I'm letting you farm it.

1270
01:02:11,730 --> 01:02:12,370
I have mine.

1271
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:15,630
There you go.

1272
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:18,990
I'm not even going to heal because I know, like, I want him to have Mantis ult first.

1273
01:02:19,370 --> 01:02:19,930
There you go.

1274
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:20,290
See?

1275
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:21,850
Strategy.

1276
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:24,090
I brought Overwatch strategy over.

1277
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:29,230
He's waiting for the biggest ult of his fucking life.

1278
01:02:34,370 --> 01:02:35,410
That's what you do in Overwatch.

1279
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:38,730
If you have ult, you let the other support farm their ults.

1280
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:41,710
What the fuck are they doing?

1281
01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:44,710
Are they going to come out?

1282
01:02:45,010 --> 01:02:48,570
They're just waiting for the biggest fucking Groot ult of their goddamn life.

1283
01:02:51,710 --> 01:02:53,030
It's going to be so huge.

1284
01:02:53,090 --> 01:02:53,830
You don't understand.

1285
01:02:53,990 --> 01:02:56,710
This Groot ult is going to change everything.

1286
01:02:57,130 --> 01:02:57,510
Okay.

1287
01:03:04,510 --> 01:03:05,410
You guys.

1288
01:03:05,830 --> 01:03:07,050
You guys don't understand.

1289
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:08,930
Dude.

1290
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:14,590
He changed nothing.

1291
01:03:15,590 --> 01:03:20,010
Some say he's still waiting for that six man Groot ult.

1292
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:24,410
The ult was so big we couldn't see it.

1293
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:25,370
That's so true.

1294
01:03:25,730 --> 01:03:28,770
Oh my god, Silver, thank you for the 20 gifted subs.

1295
01:03:28,970 --> 01:03:29,330
Thank you.

1296
01:03:29,410 --> 01:03:29,990
Thank you.

1297
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:31,870
I really appreciate it.

1298
01:03:32,170 --> 01:03:32,690
Thank you.

1299
01:03:32,970 --> 01:03:33,750
Thank you.

1300
01:03:33,970 --> 01:03:35,170
Oh my god.

1301
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:36,350
It's okay.

1302
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:37,410
Next time.

1303
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:40,250
That hurts so much.

1304
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:47,290
Yeah, I know the strange blocked him off the portal, but like that Groot held his fucking ult for too long.

1305
01:03:47,530 --> 01:03:52,350
They did the combo one time and then never again.

1306
01:03:52,590 --> 01:04:00,210
Like him and the Moon Knight were waiting for the combo because we did not see the Moon Knight or Groot ult for five fights.

1307
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:02,210
It's like...

1308
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:07,610
They didn't see it for five fights.

1309
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:13,770
Also, like, we're Q dodging this because the players were uh...

1310
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:16,850
The players were really special.

1311
01:04:18,090 --> 01:04:19,290
Oh, Max saw the message?

1312
01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:21,570
He doesn't even fucking reply back!

1313
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:22,230
What the fuck?

1314
01:04:24,690 --> 01:04:25,570
That's fucked up.

1315
01:04:25,950 --> 01:04:26,770
Has he been winning?

1316
01:04:28,170 --> 01:04:30,890
Sorry, I have to reject you.

1317
01:04:31,170 --> 01:04:31,910
Alright, let's see.

1318
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:34,910
Oh man, he's...

1319
01:04:34,910 --> 01:04:36,850
Oh man, he's in a loop.

1320
01:04:38,310 --> 01:04:38,870
He's...

1321
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:41,450
He's... Oh man.

1322
01:04:41,570 --> 01:04:43,010
It's okay, we'll turn it around for him.

1323
01:04:43,410 --> 01:04:44,570
We'll turn it around.

1324
01:04:44,710 --> 01:04:47,710
I'm at my peak at the moment, but things can go...

1325
01:04:49,070 --> 01:04:49,630
Uh...

1326
01:04:49,630 --> 01:04:51,270
Things can go...

1327
01:04:51,270 --> 01:04:53,450
Top shit on my king!

1328
01:04:53,770 --> 01:04:54,930
Zexro again?

1329
01:04:55,330 --> 01:04:57,830
And you'll have me to deal

1330
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:03,850
Bro, all I said was like...

1331
01:05:03,850 --> 01:05:05,530
Bro, I'm sorry, man.

1332
01:05:05,570 --> 01:05:06,870
I hope this gets better.

1333
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:15,000
I'm just like...

1334
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,440
Okay, look, we all know he had a bad...

1335
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:21,120
He's having a bad day of Marvel Rivals.

1336
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,520
Like, I don't want that on my games, man.

1337
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:25,880
I don't want those games.

1338
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:26,860
I...

1339
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:33,900
I...

1340
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:35,980
I'm just like, that's rough, buddy.

1341
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:37,400
That's rough.

1342
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:41,220
She...

1343
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:44,840
I understand the doom queue hours.

1344
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:48,020
I just don't want to be involved.

1345
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:50,060
I just don't want to be part of it.

1346
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:52,160
I need my top 500.

1347
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:57,080
Oh my god.

1348
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:58,720
Alright.

1349
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:00,300
We're just waiting it out.

1350
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:02,360
Because the queues were pretty...

1351
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:03,740
Because like...

1352
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:07,540
Those were some fucking weird ass players.

1353
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:10,840
So I'm just gonna wait out the queue real quick.

1354
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:13,100
Surely one day.

1355
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:17,220
Surely one day we'll be good enough to hit that...

1356
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:18,260
Hit the leaderboards.

1357
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:19,540
I think like...

1358
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:20,820
It's... What is it currently?

1359
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:23,000
It's 138.

1360
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:24,940
So I literally need like...

1361
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:25,800
Three wins.

1362
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:26,840
I don't know.

1363
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:28,560
Things are looking way too good right now.

1364
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:29,420
I don't like it.

1365
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:33,860
I don't like it when they start trying to give me hope.

1366
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:38,940
Every time...

1367
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:40,940
Every time like...

1368
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:44,840
It's... Every time it's like three games, it just...

1369
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:45,460
I don't know.

1370
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:50,000
It feels like things just start going downhill again after that.

1371
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:51,160
Like...

1372
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:53,020
Like...

1373
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:54,380
Hope is like...

1374
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:57,280
There's no hope in Marvel Rivals.

1375
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:58,740
There's just...

1376
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:00,380
There's just the grind.

1377
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:02,100
That's really it.

1378
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,320
It's just the grind.

1379
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:06,620
You either gain or you lose.

1380
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:10,020
How do you get one above all?

1381
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:12,840
You have to stay on the top 500 leaderboards?

1382
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:13,200
Wait.

1383
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:17,320
Mac might be done soon.

1384
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:20,440
Is he full holding them?

1385
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:21,880
Yeah, he is.

1386
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:22,240
Okay.

1387
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:24,400
So like...

1388
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:27,240
You basically have to stay 24 hours on the leaderboard.

1389
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:34,900
So the moment you get on the leaderboard and you hold top 500 for 24 hours, you get one above all.

1390
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:36,160
That's really it.

1391
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:38,800
The moment you're...

1392
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:41,120
The moment that happens and you're there.

1393
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:42,820
Is he full holding it?

1394
01:07:42,860 --> 01:07:43,740
Are they doing it?

1395
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:45,620
Are they actually doing it?

1396
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,280
Oh my god.

1397
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:48,480
I'm queuing.

1398
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:48,800
Wait.

1399
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:52,820
Unless... No, there's literally like two guys that's still alive.

1400
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:53,960
Wait, no, they're portaling.

1401
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:55,420
They're portaling.

1402
01:07:57,620 --> 01:07:58,200
Blink up.

1403
01:07:58,280 --> 01:07:59,060
Blink with Twitch Prime.

1404
01:07:59,180 --> 01:07:59,740
Thank you.

1405
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:00,420
Blue Hydra.

1406
01:08:00,540 --> 01:08:01,480
Blink with Twitch Prime.

1407
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:02,400
Thank you.

1408
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:02,900
Oh, shit.

1409
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:03,640
No, it's winnable.

1410
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:06,240
Alright, let's see how 3-stack goes.

1411
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:13,520
Every time I 3-stack with two DPS players, it's never been like quite the greatest.

1412
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:16,040
But like, this time it'll be different, right?

1413
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:17,220
This...

1414
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,000
Guys, I don't know many...

1415
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,340
I literally only know one tank player.

1416
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:33,040
Wait, no!

1417
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:34,200
He's losing!

1418
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:34,640
Okay.

1419
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:36,280
Nevermind.

1420
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:38,400
He didn't full hold.

1421
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:41,440
First point.

1422
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:46,860
I'm not...

1423
01:08:46,860 --> 01:08:48,420
Guess we're queuing.

1424
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:51,060
Yes.

1425
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:52,580
I'm more of a strategist.

1426
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:54,660
I think strategist is support, right?

1427
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:55,800
Yeah, I'm a support player.

1428
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:59,460
I'm a support player in Overwatch.

1429
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:04,300
Even though like I can aim, but like, I just enjoy...

1430
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:05,580
I enjoy support.

1431
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:08,720
I don't want to like learn how to be a DPS player.

1432
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:10,360
Because DPS player...

1433
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:12,760
Being a DPS player requires like different positioning.

1434
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:16,100
And like, you gotta know where the fuck health packs are.

1435
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:19,300
And like, my brain... I don't want to handle that.

1436
01:09:21,780 --> 01:09:29,560
I don't want to deal with knowing where the health packs are when I can just be a support player and heal myself.

1437
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:36,560
And then being a tank player is just wanting to have a bad time.

1438
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:45,000
Alright.

1439
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:46,660
The goon knight.

1440
01:09:46,820 --> 01:09:48,160
I don't know any of these players.

1441
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:53,820
My... Oh my god.

1442
01:09:53,880 --> 01:10:01,500
These lobbies are like, not scary, but like I'm scared because like I lose... Oh wait.

1443
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:02,120
No.

1444
01:10:03,260 --> 01:10:08,380
I saw... I heard ban back Black Panther and I'm like, I'll be Black Panther.

1445
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:13,500
Really?

1446
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:16,280
Where the fuck is the...

1447
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:18,380
Where the fuck is their Black Panther player?

1448
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,260
I have no idea who any of these people are.

1449
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:22,080
Ban Jeff next?

1450
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:26,000
Buddy, I'm... I'm banning... I want... I'm banning Bruce.

1451
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:28,920
I don't want to play against Hulk.

1452
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:37,240
Alright.

1453
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:41,300
I don't want to play against Hulk.

1454
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:44,100
Why do we ban Jeff?

1455
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:45,480
Like...

1456
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:46,200
What?

1457
01:10:48,340 --> 01:10:50,300
What the fuck?

1458
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:56,540
Bro, I rather deal with a fucking insane... Are you serious?

1459
01:10:58,040 --> 01:10:58,660
Okay.

1460
01:10:59,280 --> 01:10:59,880
Alright.

1461
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:03,880
This is the worst fucking bans I've ever seen.

1462
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:05,640
That's actually...

1463
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:09,220
These bans are fucking terrible.

1464
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:11,720
Holy shit.

1465
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:15,880
These are actually...

1466
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:19,640
Oh my god.

1467
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:20,560
Alright.

1468
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:21,620
Fucking...

1469
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:27,580
We have Hulk and Iron Man and I guess we're gonna have to play against Hulk and Iron Man.

1470
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:31,060
That's fine.

1471
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:34,120
I'm okay with that.

1472
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:38,340
I'm okay with that.

1473
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:39,380
I'm not.

1474
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:40,920
I'm like... I'm actually...

1475
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:41,780
I'm not okay.

1476
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:44,000
I'm not.

1477
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:50,700
I'm not okay with it, guys.

1478
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:55,320
I don't want... I hate playing against Hulk cause I feel like...

1479
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:58,760
I feel like nobody helps me.

1480
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:00,220
I have to help myself.

1481
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:03,720
Alright.

1482
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:05,700
Oh my god.

1483
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,040
It's the Rocky Raccoon.

1484
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:08,300
It's the man with no hands.

1485
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:10,360
That's fucking right.

1486
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:10,920
I'm a hater.

1487
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:12,560
I'm a hater.

1488
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:18,120
Any other... The other supports that have to play would be Rocky Raccoon will agree with me.

1489
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:26,560
Because Rocky Raccoon is one of the few character crew supports that does not peel.

1490
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:28,820
At all.

1491
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,180
It's so frustrating.

1492
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:31,680
They literally don't know how to peel.

1493
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:36,200
They don't know how to peel for the other support.

1494
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:38,020
They just fly away.

1495
01:12:38,780 --> 01:12:40,620
They fucking... They just fly.

1496
01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:43,300
I need heals.

1497
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:43,680
I need heals.

1498
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:48,520
Look at that.

1499
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:49,940
I literally...

1500
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:51,520
I had to just run away.

1501
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:51,620
Alright.

1502
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:55,940
There's a magic on us.

1503
01:12:55,980 --> 01:12:56,400
She's frozen.

1504
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:01,220
I swear to god, if after I...

1505
01:13:01,220 --> 01:13:03,080
I swear... Please, there's a magic on me.

1506
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:05,720
I swear.

1507
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:09,860
I'm my own peel.

1508
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:15,550
I have to peel for myself.

1509
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:20,840
Oh my god, strangers have...

1510
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:27,800
The support is just sitting on high ground.

1511
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:29,380
Oh.

1512
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:34,480
We can't do...

1513
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:35,400
We can't see where I'm at.

1514
01:13:37,740 --> 01:13:38,940
I'm just gonna ult this.

1515
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:39,580
I'm ulting on point.

1516
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:40,160
I'm ulting on point.

1517
01:13:43,540 --> 01:13:44,820
Oh my god.

1518
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:46,860
Alright.

1519
01:13:47,060 --> 01:13:48,540
They're gonna strange ult after my ult.

1520
01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:51,860
And then I might die.

1521
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:54,040
Oh, it's alright.

1522
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:56,160
Strange is gonna fuck me up, I guess.

1523
01:13:57,620 --> 01:13:59,360
No, he's so low.

1524
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:01,560
I just...

1525
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:03,320
Oh my god, I wish I could just...

1526
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:04,640
Oh, I wish I...

1527
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:07,520
I want...

1528
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:15,680
Literally, the only way I get peeled is if like, I freeze.

1529
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:17,560
I freeze somebody.

1530
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:22,500
You see the Rakurekku run away from me the moment magic shows up?

1531
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:23,600
Yeah, that's why.

1532
01:14:23,780 --> 01:14:25,120
That's why I fucking...

1533
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:27,020
I would call it animal control.

1534
01:14:30,380 --> 01:14:31,000
Where?

1535
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:35,960
Why?

1536
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:39,120
Why?

1537
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:45,060
Bro, solo tank Hulk is so rough.

1538
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:46,280
Not gonna lie.

1539
01:14:46,340 --> 01:14:46,860
We got two.

1540
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:47,800
We can push up.

1541
01:14:52,650 --> 01:14:53,450
Jesus Christ.

1542
01:14:54,510 --> 01:14:54,910
Please!

1543
01:14:55,610 --> 01:14:57,050
Oh my god!

1544
01:14:58,610 --> 01:15:00,490
Oh my god!

1545
01:15:02,110 --> 01:15:02,790
Strange is half.

1546
01:15:02,990 --> 01:15:03,370
Strange is one.

1547
01:15:03,450 --> 01:15:03,870
Strange is one.

1548
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:07,390
Please, he's so low.

1549
01:15:09,090 --> 01:15:09,730
Hold up, hold up.

1550
01:15:09,770 --> 01:15:10,710
I'm gonna try and one-shot Ludo.

1551
01:15:12,170 --> 01:15:13,070
Oh my god.

1552
01:15:13,370 --> 01:15:13,910
They have it, right?

1553
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:14,190
They have it.

1554
01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:15,350
Yeah, they do.

1555
01:15:15,430 --> 01:15:16,030
They have ult.

1556
01:15:16,950 --> 01:15:21,490
Oh my god.

1557
01:15:21,490 --> 01:15:22,450
Oh my god, please.

1558
01:15:22,630 --> 01:15:23,590
Where's my Iron Man?

1559
01:15:27,370 --> 01:15:28,750
Oh, that's me.

1560
01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:32,530
Oh my god.

1561
01:15:32,590 --> 01:15:35,390
Hulk solo tank is so fucking rough.

1562
01:15:37,530 --> 01:15:38,690
It really is.

1563
01:15:38,930 --> 01:15:39,430
They're portaling.

1564
01:15:42,370 --> 01:15:43,230
Oh my god.

1565
01:15:43,230 --> 01:15:44,150
We can't see up there.

1566
01:15:44,990 --> 01:15:45,870
I need heals.

1567
01:15:45,870 --> 01:15:47,410
I'm gonna get ran down.

1568
01:15:47,550 --> 01:15:47,870
It's fine.

1569
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:55,580
There's like, there's two people behind us.

1570
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:58,720
I can ult this.

1571
01:15:58,900 --> 01:15:59,740
Are we winning this fight?

1572
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:03,000
Alright, let's fucking go.

1573
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:06,640
Alright, don't!

1574
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:10,000
Hulk, I can't save you there!

1575
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:11,600
Alright!

1576
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:17,480
Oh, we got walled up.

1577
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:18,280
Okay.

1578
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:22,700
I don't like this team comp at all.

1579
01:16:33,110 --> 01:16:35,880
We can, but it's just squishy fetching it.

1580
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:40,580
Oh, nevermind.

1581
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:42,760
Magic's one.

1582
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:47,700
Bro, this this comp is ass.

1583
01:16:47,860 --> 01:16:49,860
This comp is ass!

1584
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:54,420
Oh, Strange is one.

1585
01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:58,020
I hate this comp.

1586
01:16:58,900 --> 01:16:59,340
I...

1587
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:01,880
I hate this comp.

1588
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:04,680
It's such a bad comp.

1589
01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:08,920
Like, why are we solo tanking all of them?

1590
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:10,620
Oh my god.

1591
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:12,180
They have Strange ult here.

1592
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:18,140
They haven't used Luna ult at all.

1593
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:28,840
Because I have nobody to trigger Luna ult!

1594
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:30,640
Like...

1595
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:34,520
Like, what do you want me to do?

1596
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:36,620
Nobody is, like, triggering it!

1597
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:39,800
Oh my god.

1598
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:40,400
Oh my god, I got a clap.

1599
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:41,760
I got a clap!

1600
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:42,820
I got a clap!

1601
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:44,380
Strange is half.

1602
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:46,540
Strange is low.

1603
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:58,760
Oh my god.

1604
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:05,700
Our Ironman's holding off because he wants to do, like, a clip where he fucking kills the Luna!

1605
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:08,060
But it's like, why?!

1606
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:09,500
Why?!

1607
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:10,560
There goes Strange ult after this.

1608
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:13,720
They used Luna ult.

1609
01:18:21,570 --> 01:18:28,990
Oh my god!

1610
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:33,620
The hell is wrong?

1611
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:35,840
Oh my god!

1612
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:39,840
Did we do anything?!

1613
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:42,700
This Ironman held off for, like, four fights.

1614
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:46,620
I just...

1615
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:47,850
I can't...

1616
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:51,040
This Ironman held off for four fights.

1617
01:18:51,380 --> 01:18:54,220
Like, I'm just gonna say, was it...

1618
01:18:54,220 --> 01:18:55,460
Oh my god.

1619
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:59,980
Oh my god, like...

1620
01:18:59,980 --> 01:19:01,680
I swear, there's a... Strange is half.

1621
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:02,120
Strange is low.

1622
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:02,220
Oh!

1623
01:19:08,890 --> 01:19:10,050
I can't see you, Hulk.

1624
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:11,050
Or Ironman.

1625
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:16,970
Guys, get on point!

1626
01:19:17,030 --> 01:19:17,290
Stay on point!

1627
01:19:17,450 --> 01:19:17,530
Stay on point!

1628
01:19:18,130 --> 01:19:18,550
Strange is half!

1629
01:19:18,630 --> 01:19:19,050
Strange is half!

1630
01:19:20,690 --> 01:19:22,850
I froze Psylocke behind me.

1631
01:19:29,630 --> 01:19:32,450
Oh, we left the point!

1632
01:19:37,650 --> 01:19:38,310
What?!

1633
01:19:38,310 --> 01:19:38,910
I...

1634
01:19:38,910 --> 01:19:42,630
Bro, I need to know why the fuck we...

1635
01:19:42,630 --> 01:19:44,350
Why the fuck we saved.

1636
01:19:44,590 --> 01:19:46,450
Ironman held off for three fucking fights.

1637
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:47,210
Just use it.

1638
01:19:47,550 --> 01:19:49,430
Nothing is triggering...

1639
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:52,470
Nothing is triggering the fight!

1640
01:19:52,950 --> 01:19:54,850
Nobody's triggering Luna ult!

1641
01:20:02,220 --> 01:20:06,060
I can play Loki if someone Lunas.

1642
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:10,840
Please!

1643
01:20:11,180 --> 01:20:12,480
I am giving you Luna!

1644
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,720
I am giving you Luna!

1645
01:20:18,740 --> 01:20:20,640
Guys, it's...

1646
01:20:21,570 --> 01:20:23,280
It's okay, I can solo heal.

1647
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:28,360
What?

1648
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:32,900
It's alright.

1649
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:39,440
I hate GM players.

1650
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,740
How do you have an ego?

1651
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:51,580
You're a GM.

1652
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:52,820
How do you...

1653
01:20:52,820 --> 01:20:55,960
Anybody can hit GM, it's actually...

1654
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:57,500
Oh my god, if you have...

1655
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:58,280
Oh my god.

1656
01:20:58,580 --> 01:21:01,380
It's when you're at like...

1657
01:21:01,790 --> 01:21:06,180
At like the GM ones to try to get to Eternity, that's where hell truly is.

1658
01:21:07,060 --> 01:21:10,740
No, this is absolutely a loss.

1659
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:12,260
Oh wait, I can...

1660
01:21:12,260 --> 01:21:14,540
I can heal myself like this.

1661
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:16,940
I'll just clap to heal myself.

1662
01:21:17,380 --> 01:21:18,200
That's really it.

1663
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:20,320
I literally can't take damage here.

1664
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:24,360
Oh my god, here we go.

1665
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:27,460
No, this is 100% a loss.

1666
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:32,060
Guys, people just have egos and like, you can't do anything about it.

1667
01:21:32,380 --> 01:21:34,580
I need to like, get more claps though.

1668
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:37,540
Literally, this is my only source of healing.

1669
01:21:42,180 --> 01:21:43,140
We're up one.

1670
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:47,280
I just have to play extremely safe.

1671
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:48,520
That's really it.

1672
01:21:50,980 --> 01:21:51,560
I...

1673
01:21:54,220 --> 01:21:57,000
Just nobody wants to play support and that's okay.

1674
01:22:00,580 --> 01:22:02,060
I can solo heal.

1675
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:06,040
Just...

1676
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:07,520
Just don't take the health packs.

1677
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:11,400
Like, I...

1678
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:13,260
I need the health packs.

1679
01:22:13,780 --> 01:22:15,140
I need to live.

1680
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:19,200
Literally, my only source of heal is this.

1681
01:22:19,540 --> 01:22:21,660
So like, do not take the health packs.

1682
01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:28,190
I'm just gonna...

1683
01:22:28,190 --> 01:22:29,570
I'm gonna go in with my ult.

1684
01:22:31,690 --> 01:22:32,070
Alright.

1685
01:22:33,150 --> 01:22:35,250
Alright, it's hell unleashed.

1686
01:22:35,610 --> 01:22:36,490
I'm on the cart.

1687
01:22:38,110 --> 01:22:38,670
Alright.

1688
01:22:39,970 --> 01:22:40,730
No more ult.

1689
01:22:44,450 --> 01:22:45,070
No.

1690
01:22:45,070 --> 01:22:47,210
Oh, this is where I die.

1691
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:48,110
Alright.

1692
01:22:48,510 --> 01:22:50,070
This is where I die.

1693
01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:59,730
Yeah, but I need to save my ice ball if I get dived.

1694
01:22:59,870 --> 01:23:00,490
That's the thing.

1695
01:23:01,290 --> 01:23:01,890
I can't...

1696
01:23:01,890 --> 01:23:04,290
I can't like, waste that for heals.

1697
01:23:05,810 --> 01:23:06,490
Like...

1698
01:23:07,630 --> 01:23:10,190
Like, my ult is so...

1699
01:23:10,190 --> 01:23:16,970
My freeze is so important that like, if I wasted on a fucking...

1700
01:23:16,970 --> 01:23:21,290
If I wasted on just for the sake of like, healing, it's not great.

1701
01:23:22,870 --> 01:23:24,590
Oh my god, how?

1702
01:23:26,410 --> 01:23:27,010
Guys!

1703
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:32,170
I don't know if you guys know this, but I'm the solo healer.

1704
01:23:32,370 --> 01:23:34,450
I don't know, everybody.

1705
01:23:35,150 --> 01:23:40,030
I don't know if it was smart to push up.

1706
01:23:40,030 --> 01:23:40,810
Hahaha.

1707
01:23:42,290 --> 01:23:46,030
Especially that now that I have like, no second...

1708
01:23:46,850 --> 01:23:48,630
See, this is why we ban Bruce Banner.

1709
01:23:50,110 --> 01:23:50,710
Hahaha.

1710
01:23:54,810 --> 01:23:55,410
Hahaha.

1711
01:23:56,410 --> 01:23:56,630
Hahaha.

1712
01:23:56,950 --> 01:23:59,350
You guys caused this yourself.

1713
01:23:59,530 --> 01:24:01,950
Like, I don't... Like, you all deserve it.

1714
01:24:02,730 --> 01:24:03,330
Like...

1715
01:24:04,510 --> 01:24:07,010
You guys literally caused this.

1716
01:24:07,190 --> 01:24:09,250
It was so...

1717
01:24:09,250 --> 01:24:11,430
It was so winnable.

1718
01:24:11,490 --> 01:24:12,950
He's crying too much to play.

1719
01:24:13,330 --> 01:24:13,550
It's alright.

1720
01:24:15,590 --> 01:24:17,270
He's really angry.

1721
01:24:26,150 --> 01:24:28,890
How do you even get a lord on fucking Scarlet Witch?

1722
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:30,950
I think he got angry and started crying.

1723
01:24:31,710 --> 01:24:32,230
Hahaha.

1724
01:24:33,810 --> 01:24:35,110
Ah, perfectly cool.

1725
01:24:36,090 --> 01:24:38,330
You can take it out if you want.

1726
01:24:40,610 --> 01:24:41,490
We swapped off.

1727
01:24:41,650 --> 01:24:42,090
Oh yeah.

1728
01:24:42,970 --> 01:24:44,910
Oh no!

1729
01:24:45,510 --> 01:24:47,590
Why am I going rocket?

1730
01:24:51,730 --> 01:24:51,850
Hahaha.

1731
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:04,000
Why do they have egos?

1732
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:08,200
Why do they have egos?

1733
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:09,440
I don't understand.

1734
01:25:10,780 --> 01:25:14,660
I don't understand why you all have... They have all these egos.

1735
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:18,340
You can only have an ego of your fucking top 100, like, at that point.

1736
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:18,980
Hahaha.

1737
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:23,360
Oh my god.

1738
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:25,760
Like, every...

1739
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:27,520
Everyone I know is GM.

1740
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:31,400
People, like, would get GM and just make smurfs.

1741
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:34,060
And then they'll get GM and they'll make another smurf.

1742
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:36,740
And then they'll get GM and they'll make another smurf.

1743
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:41,120
They can never get past eternity, so they just keep farming GM.

1744
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:42,120
Hahaha.

1745
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:46,660
They should not have an ego.

1746
01:25:50,110 --> 01:25:51,510
That sounds sad.

1747
01:25:51,650 --> 01:25:55,650
That's literally, like, so many people I know that does that.

1748
01:25:57,530 --> 01:26:01,270
It's not even, like... I'm not even being, like, joking about it.

1749
01:26:01,350 --> 01:26:03,410
Like, literally, they all do that.

1750
01:26:03,410 --> 01:26:04,090
Hahaha.

1751
01:26:05,590 --> 01:26:06,870
It's just endless.

1752
01:26:10,420 --> 01:26:11,140
That's fine.

1753
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:13,100
Maybe Mac will change all of this.

1754
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:14,920
Mac... Mac doesn't have an ego.

1755
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:16,220
That's fine.

1756
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:20,280
I mean, he does, but, like, he has this fucking Black Panther ego.

1757
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:24,460
But, like, other than that, like, it should be okay, right, guys?

1758
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:25,660
Hahaha.

1759
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,260
Like, not even...

1760
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:32,340
Ayy, she got a kill!

1761
01:26:32,340 --> 01:26:32,940
Good!

1762
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:34,840
Good for you!

1763
01:26:36,340 --> 01:26:38,140
Like, I'm just standing still.

1764
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:38,800
Hahaha.

1765
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:43,340
Ayy, I'm just gonna stand still.

1766
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:50,700
Like, how?

1767
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:51,960
How?

1768
01:26:52,220 --> 01:26:54,160
Why are we solo hulking?

1769
01:26:54,340 --> 01:26:56,020
I still don't understand.

1770
01:26:59,660 --> 01:27:01,180
Oh, hey, look, Berserker Rage.

1771
01:27:01,260 --> 01:27:02,240
Oh, no.

1772
01:27:02,740 --> 01:27:05,260
Are we gonna play more?

1773
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:07,180
Or... Hahaha.

1774
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:08,680
Oh, my God.

1775
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:10,920
No way.

1776
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:13,620
How did...

1777
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:15,000
We made it through?

1778
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:18,020
There's no...

1779
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:22,940
I won't throw, but still I won't be happy.

1780
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:24,100
Hahaha.

1781
01:27:28,420 --> 01:27:29,740
I won't be happy.

1782
01:27:30,260 --> 01:27:31,000
Hahaha.

1783
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:38,880
I won't be happy, though.

1784
01:27:40,660 --> 01:27:43,000
I have to stay on cart, because I actually don't trust people.

1785
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:45,340
Actually, JK.

1786
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:46,740
I'll fucking leave.

1787
01:27:48,980 --> 01:27:49,660
Alright.

1788
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:51,540
I'm... Alright.

1789
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:52,720
Bye.

1790
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:53,460
Hahaha.

1791
01:27:55,700 --> 01:28:01,360
I won't be happy about this, but I guess we go move on.

1792
01:28:02,660 --> 01:28:06,500
The worst part is, like, I have a feeling that we're gonna...

1793
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:07,700
We're... It's...

1794
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:10,140
It's just, you know...

1795
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:18,220
We're gonna get there and then it's, like, we play the extra couple of minutes just to, like, you know...

1796
01:28:18,220 --> 01:28:18,900
Oh, there's our Hulk.

1797
01:28:18,980 --> 01:28:19,660
Goodbye, Hulk.

1798
01:28:19,980 --> 01:28:20,820
Like, why?

1799
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:24,240
Why did you go up?

1800
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:28,980
And then, like, I don't know.

1801
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:30,620
My entire team just falls over.

1802
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:32,200
Like, I don't know.

1803
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:35,500
It's just... It feels like that's gonna happen.

1804
01:28:36,180 --> 01:28:41,000
Like, we literally have a baby right now, running around, thinking he's part of the team.

1805
01:28:41,620 --> 01:28:41,640
Hahaha.

1806
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:44,020
Goodbye.

1807
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:48,480
Oh, my god.

1808
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:50,340
I... Alright.

1809
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:51,760
If I...

1810
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:58,200
If I knew that sound cue earlier, I... I would've 100%, like, saved his life.

1811
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:00,480
He could've got his ults back, actually.

1812
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:02,540
He actually could've got the ult off.

1813
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:05,660
Yeah.

1814
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:07,860
We went so far.

1815
01:29:08,940 --> 01:29:09,500
Hahaha.

1816
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:13,500
Don't worry, you're right.

1817
01:29:14,060 --> 01:29:15,480
We have... Oh, man.

1818
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:16,900
I knew it.

1819
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:18,180
We have... Don't worry, guys.

1820
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:20,020
We have Wolverine as the off-tank.

1821
01:29:20,180 --> 01:29:20,900
Don't worry.

1822
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:21,920
Woo!

1823
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:25,480
You see... Now you see why I hate Rocket players?

1824
01:29:25,980 --> 01:29:26,220
What?

1825
01:29:26,380 --> 01:29:30,720
Now you see why I hate Rocket players?

1826
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:38,740
Alright.

1827
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:52,640
Alright.

1828
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:54,820
Okay.

1829
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:56,820
Alright.

1830
01:29:57,940 --> 01:30:01,760
Guess some people just don't deserve to talk.

1831
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,100
Jesus Christ.

1832
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:06,660
Alright, let's...

1833
01:30:06,660 --> 01:30:09,340
Okay, what game is he on right now?

1834
01:30:10,940 --> 01:30:12,360
Did he just queue up?

1835
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:13,580
How close is he?

1836
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,080
How close is your game to ending?

1837
01:30:16,740 --> 01:30:19,060
How... How close is...

1838
01:30:19,060 --> 01:30:20,080
Okay, how... Sorry.

1839
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:23,820
Close is your game to ending.

1840
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:25,540
Do we wait?

1841
01:30:27,820 --> 01:30:29,100
Oh, we spectate him?

1842
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:30,420
Yeah, let's fucking spectate him.

1843
01:30:31,100 --> 01:30:31,560
Fuck it.

1844
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:33,630
How do I...

1845
01:30:35,300 --> 01:30:36,480
How do I spectate?

1846
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:39,900
Oh, I can't.

1847
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:41,920
Wait, how do I...

1848
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:42,720
I can't spectate?

1849
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:43,680
I thought you can.

1850
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:45,840
We're in second half.

1851
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:46,260
Alright.

1852
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:48,260
Oh, we can.

1853
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:51,480
Oh, when we're on a team, you can't spectate?

1854
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:54,660
Oh, I didn't know that.

1855
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:55,700
Is he losing?

1856
01:30:56,420 --> 01:30:57,000
Oh, fuck.

1857
01:30:57,060 --> 01:30:57,300
Okay.

1858
01:30:57,300 --> 01:30:57,400
Okay.

1859
01:30:59,020 --> 01:31:00,140
That's alright.

1860
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:05,460
It's okay.

1861
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:05,600
It's alright.

1862
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:07,660
Things are...

1863
01:31:07,660 --> 01:31:08,320
It's okay.

1864
01:31:09,020 --> 01:31:10,280
Oh, the cute quick play.

1865
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:11,780
Alright.

1866
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:13,300
Let's queue...

1867
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:16,920
Let's queue a quick play game.

1868
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:19,470
Cause he's...

1869
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:21,160
He might be a while.

1870
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:21,340
Oh.

1871
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:27,980
Yeah.

1872
01:31:28,660 --> 01:31:31,120
I'll just queue a quick play game that we're waiting.

1873
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:45,240
Oh my god, Mac.

1874
01:31:45,660 --> 01:31:47,360
Oh my fucking god.

1875
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:54,480
Is he on a low key arc?

1876
01:31:54,940 --> 01:31:57,400
Oh my god, I swear to my god.

1877
01:31:57,400 --> 01:31:58,860
I cannot have him.

1878
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:01,300
I cannot have him in like...

1879
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:02,820
In a different arc right now.

1880
01:32:02,980 --> 01:32:05,640
He is an insane Starlord player.

1881
01:32:05,740 --> 01:32:07,800
I cannot have him on like...

1882
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:09,840
Different fucking arcs at the moment.

1883
01:32:12,140 --> 01:32:12,580
Wait.

1884
01:32:13,140 --> 01:32:14,880
Oh, I guess he doesn't want to play quick play.

1885
01:32:15,140 --> 01:32:17,800
Okay, I guess I'll play a quick play game.

1886
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:20,540
Wait, he has one minute left.

1887
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:21,800
Wait, he can actually live.

1888
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:23,580
Wait, there's... Oh, nope.

1889
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:25,060
Nope, they're no more died.

1890
01:32:25,260 --> 01:32:27,240
Wait, unless... Oh no, they got a pick.

1891
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:28,340
They're up one.

1892
01:32:29,660 --> 01:32:31,400
They're... Oh, they're... Oh, wait.

1893
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:32,320
Wait, it's possible.

1894
01:32:32,940 --> 01:32:35,120
Wait, I might not even need to...

1895
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:36,380
Wait, I can spectate, right?

1896
01:32:37,340 --> 01:32:37,680
Alright.

1897
01:32:39,580 --> 01:32:41,840
There's like a delay apparently if you're spectating.

1898
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:44,280
So like...

1899
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:45,760
It might not...

1900
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:47,300
Be this... It might not like...

1901
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:49,360
He might end and I'm still in this fucking spectating.

1902
01:32:50,140 --> 01:32:50,800
Oh, yeah.

1903
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:51,400
There, yes.

1904
01:32:51,620 --> 01:32:52,860
Yeah, I literally saw that.

1905
01:32:56,640 --> 01:32:59,460
Yeah, there's a huge delay so people can't stream snipe.

1906
01:32:59,780 --> 01:33:01,040
Which is smart.

1907
01:33:01,940 --> 01:33:02,460
IMO.

1908
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:04,200
Look at him go.

1909
01:33:04,980 --> 01:33:05,920
Look at him go.

1910
01:33:06,860 --> 01:33:07,800
Look at him dance.

1911
01:33:07,900 --> 01:33:08,660
You know what I realized?

1912
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:11,600
I realized when Loki is copying Luna...

1913
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:12,800
He's like interslaying.

1914
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:15,040
Like, he's so...

1915
01:33:15,780 --> 01:33:17,180
He's such a method actor.

1916
01:33:17,740 --> 01:33:20,600
Like, he absorbs into the role of Luna.

1917
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:20,740
Yeah.

1918
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:26,820
Cause like, that Luna ult is literally Loki.

1919
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:28,720
Being like...

1920
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:30,060
Being fabulous.

1921
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:32,620
He's like so hard.

1922
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:40,320
Wait, I think they might win.

1923
01:33:40,820 --> 01:33:41,880
I think they're gonna win this.

1924
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:45,520
Oh, please win this.

1925
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:47,980
Please so I can queue up my next game.

1926
01:33:47,980 --> 01:33:48,400
Please.

1927
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:49,800
I really appreciate it.

1928
01:33:52,020 --> 01:33:54,220
Oh, I should've asked really nicely.

1929
01:33:54,380 --> 01:33:55,800
I was like, can I have a Loki?

1930
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:01,400
Oh my god.

1931
01:34:01,780 --> 01:34:06,780
Oh, why did I ask really nicely in voice chat and be like...

1932
01:34:06,780 --> 01:34:07,440
Hey guys.

1933
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:08,940
Can I have a Loki?

1934
01:34:09,220 --> 01:34:10,480
I mean my team.

1935
01:34:13,540 --> 01:34:14,100
Loki.

1936
01:34:17,980 --> 01:34:18,500
I love his hair.

1937
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:20,380
Hey everybody.

1938
01:34:20,700 --> 01:34:23,900
I really think if we have a Loki, we can win, guys.

1939
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:29,760
They're not.

1940
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:33,320
My Sochi would never.

1941
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:37,440
My Sochi guys wanna win.

1942
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:45,080
Thank you for the Twitch Prime.

1943
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:46,640
Oh, they lost the point.

1944
01:34:46,820 --> 01:34:48,280
God fucking dammit.

1945
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:51,320
Sorry, spoiler ahead.

1946
01:34:52,060 --> 01:34:54,620
They lost the point, guys.

1947
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:59,300
No, instead like, my teammates got super racist instead.

1948
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:01,280
Which was...

1949
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:02,900
Which was not a fun time.

1950
01:35:06,860 --> 01:35:12,560
Instead of that, I had to deal with my teammates not being very happy.

1951
01:35:17,180 --> 01:35:17,920
Who's this?

1952
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:18,380
Our third.

1953
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:20,040
That's stuck in the fucking game.

1954
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:22,740
And like, I don't know if they're gonna win or lose.

1955
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:25,220
I mean, they have 45 seconds left.

1956
01:35:26,260 --> 01:35:28,840
My Oshi not wanting to win.

1957
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:31,180
Who are... No, I know, right?

1958
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:32,640
Next time, guys.

1959
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:33,300
Next time.

1960
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:36,820
To be fair, it's a 50-50.

1961
01:35:37,380 --> 01:35:39,900
Cause then, they'll just be like quiet.

1962
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:43,040
So like, you know.

1963
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:47,100
I can't be 100% sure that they'll actually swap to Loki.

1964
01:35:47,680 --> 01:35:51,220
Because then there's the possibility where they're like, quiet.

1965
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:53,000
And then I'll be like, okay.

1966
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:55,700
Like...

1967
01:35:58,340 --> 01:35:59,860
So like, you know.

1968
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:01,320
It's not guaranteed.

1969
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:03,520
Are they winning?

1970
01:36:03,640 --> 01:36:04,160
No, they're...

1971
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:05,740
I can't tell if they're winning or losing.

1972
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:08,020
Oh, that's smart.

1973
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:10,500
Wow, Mac, that's actually so fucking smart.

1974
01:36:11,260 --> 01:36:12,380
They lost.

1975
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:18,440
That was smart, though.

1976
01:36:23,140 --> 01:36:24,540
They C9'd.

1977
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:25,980
That was very smart.

1978
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:28,580
I appreciate how smart that was.

1979
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:31,460
Alright.

1980
01:36:32,020 --> 01:36:34,560
I hope to God he doesn't forget again.

1981
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:36,080
I hope to God.

1982
01:36:40,860 --> 01:36:41,720
It's alright.

1983
01:36:42,180 --> 01:36:43,160
Things will be okay.

1984
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:45,680
I swear to God.

1985
01:36:45,740 --> 01:36:48,420
If he queues one more game, I swear to fucking God.

1986
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:54,040
Alright.

1987
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:58,400
And then...

1988
01:36:58,400 --> 01:36:59,160
Um, wait.

1989
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:00,300
What happened to our third?

1990
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:04,000
Was it...

1991
01:37:05,460 --> 01:37:06,840
Yeah, that's it.

1992
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:11,160
It'll be funny if...

1993
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:13,360
If like...

1994
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:15,100
I just invited the wrong Drake.

1995
01:37:18,620 --> 01:37:20,160
Alright, he...

1996
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:22,600
Where did the third go?

1997
01:37:27,380 --> 01:37:28,180
Oh!

1998
01:37:30,660 --> 01:37:31,840
Okay, never mind.

1999
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:34,900
Alright, well...

2000
01:37:34,900 --> 01:37:36,460
I hope they like...

2001
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:37,640
Request to join.

2002
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:42,780
I hope they...

2003
01:37:43,780 --> 01:37:47,180
The forever incomplete party.

2004
01:37:47,300 --> 01:37:50,160
How did we lose one over the other?

2005
01:37:50,680 --> 01:37:52,240
How did that happen?

2006
01:37:55,940 --> 01:37:58,740
I thought we were all ready.

2007
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:00,560
I thought we were gaming.

2008
01:38:05,110 --> 01:38:07,160
Where did they all go?

2009
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:11,400
Where did they all go?

2010
01:38:15,130 --> 01:38:17,350
Where did they all go?

2011
01:38:19,330 --> 01:38:19,890
Where did they all go?

2012
01:38:19,890 --> 01:38:20,690
Waiting for...

2013
01:38:21,010 --> 01:38:21,850
The third.

2014
01:38:22,610 --> 01:38:23,670
Oh my God.

2015
01:38:23,930 --> 01:38:26,090
They are the same person.

2016
01:38:26,630 --> 01:38:29,010
It's just Mac on his other monitor.

2017
01:38:31,710 --> 01:38:34,490
I can only have one.

2018
01:38:35,070 --> 01:38:36,650
I can never have three.

2019
01:38:36,990 --> 01:38:38,610
I can never have...

2020
01:38:38,610 --> 01:38:39,930
I can only duo.

2021
01:38:39,930 --> 01:38:41,230
I can never trio.

2022
01:38:41,710 --> 01:38:42,430
Apparently.

2023
01:38:43,890 --> 01:38:46,430
It's the three stack in the room with us.

2024
01:38:46,550 --> 01:38:47,450
Right now.

2025
01:38:49,070 --> 01:38:50,630
My games have been...

2026
01:38:50,630 --> 01:38:52,130
That's great to hear!

2027
01:38:57,890 --> 01:38:58,610
Please!

2028
01:39:05,070 --> 01:39:07,690
Why would you say that?

2029
01:39:09,930 --> 01:39:11,810
Why would you?

2030
01:39:12,290 --> 01:39:13,430
Oh my God.

2031
01:39:13,530 --> 01:39:15,150
For those who don't see.

2032
01:39:19,770 --> 01:39:21,990
I'm so mentally...

2033
01:39:21,990 --> 01:39:23,350
Strong right now.

2034
01:39:23,930 --> 01:39:24,550
Please.

2035
01:39:24,730 --> 01:39:26,590
I want...

2036
01:39:26,590 --> 01:39:27,350
Please.

2037
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:33,850
We are not...

2038
01:39:33,850 --> 01:39:35,210
Duo queuing.

2039
01:39:37,170 --> 01:39:38,590
Oh my God.

2040
01:39:38,950 --> 01:39:41,210
I recruited a...

2041
01:39:41,210 --> 01:39:41,950
Duo queuer.

2042
01:39:42,370 --> 01:39:43,470
Oh no.

2043
01:39:45,430 --> 01:39:46,190
No.

2044
01:39:46,350 --> 01:39:48,170
This can't happen right now.

2045
01:39:50,890 --> 01:39:51,730
Oh my God.

2046
01:39:51,790 --> 01:39:53,910
It's going to turn around.

2047
01:39:55,810 --> 01:39:57,530
I swear to God.

2048
01:39:57,630 --> 01:39:59,630
It's going to turn around right here.

2049
01:39:59,750 --> 01:40:00,470
Right now.

2050
01:40:00,470 --> 01:40:01,610
I believe.

2051
01:40:02,350 --> 01:40:04,050
I believe.

2052
01:40:04,390 --> 01:40:05,850
Surely he's not going to...

2053
01:40:05,850 --> 01:40:07,390
Doom cube his way.

2054
01:40:08,770 --> 01:40:09,070
Yeah.

2055
01:40:09,650 --> 01:40:10,070
Please.

2056
01:40:11,450 --> 01:40:13,190
We were so close.

2057
01:40:14,030 --> 01:40:16,290
We were doing so well.

2058
01:40:19,170 --> 01:40:20,690
Oh my God.

2059
01:40:21,820 --> 01:40:23,710
My third pick is going to take...

2060
01:40:23,710 --> 01:40:24,110
20 minutes?

2061
01:40:24,790 --> 01:40:27,750
We were all looking at the same stream.

2062
01:40:32,370 --> 01:40:35,670
We were all looking at the same stream.

2063
01:40:36,690 --> 01:40:37,910
I get randoms.

2064
01:40:37,970 --> 01:40:39,010
Didn't have to fight.

2065
01:40:39,390 --> 01:40:41,890
Surefour, Sinatraa, and Rockus.

2066
01:40:42,010 --> 01:40:43,530
Oh man, that's actually rough.

2067
01:40:44,810 --> 01:40:46,130
That's a rough queue.

2068
01:40:46,290 --> 01:40:47,890
Wait, are they all still on?

2069
01:40:50,050 --> 01:40:51,350
Hey, Surefour got off.

2070
01:40:52,650 --> 01:40:53,890
You should be fine now.

2071
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:55,330
Surefour got off.

2072
01:41:01,930 --> 01:41:03,430
Why did you add Drake as a friend?

2073
01:41:03,810 --> 01:41:04,890
Drake's a solo act.

2074
01:41:05,750 --> 01:41:06,990
They don't care.

2075
01:41:07,610 --> 01:41:09,110
They don't want Drake.

2076
01:41:09,770 --> 01:41:11,790
Drake doesn't care.

2077
01:41:12,630 --> 01:41:13,430
He's too busy.

2078
01:41:13,850 --> 01:41:15,650
He's too busy making...

2079
01:41:15,650 --> 01:41:17,070
Diss tracks right now.

2080
01:41:19,450 --> 01:41:21,210
We just need the trio buff.

2081
01:41:22,270 --> 01:41:23,010
Do we just...

2082
01:41:23,010 --> 01:41:24,830
I guess we just queue as a duo.

2083
01:41:25,430 --> 01:41:25,810
Alright.

2084
01:41:41,580 --> 01:41:43,620
Alright, I will wait...

2085
01:41:43,620 --> 01:41:45,620
I will wait two more minutes...

2086
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:48,080
And if Drake fucking disappears...

2087
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:50,240
And I'll have to write his next diss track.

2088
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:50,880
Sorry, not second.

2089
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:51,780
He has so many diss tracks.

2090
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:53,300
If he's not here...

2091
01:41:53,300 --> 01:41:55,660
In two more minutes...

2092
01:41:55,660 --> 01:41:56,340
He's too busy.

2093
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:57,340
We're queuing up.

2094
01:41:58,020 --> 01:41:59,220
And then maybe losing.

2095
01:41:59,340 --> 01:42:00,560
Because Mac's doing queuing.

2096
01:42:00,680 --> 01:42:01,880
So I'm a little scared.

2097
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:05,280
Oh, sorry.

2098
01:42:05,480 --> 01:42:05,960
Kendrick.

2099
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:07,300
I mean, yeah.

2100
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:08,680
Drake loves himself too much.

2101
01:42:09,340 --> 01:42:11,220
Drake loves himself too much to be a hater.

2102
01:42:11,220 --> 01:42:13,960
Sorry, Kendrick's going to be writing his next diss track.

2103
01:42:16,540 --> 01:42:18,960
So he's not here, I think.

2104
01:42:19,020 --> 01:42:20,640
I think he actually disappeared.

2105
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:22,740
I think he actually...

2106
01:42:22,740 --> 01:42:25,510
He actually just fucking vanished.

2107
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:27,900
Like...

2108
01:42:27,900 --> 01:42:30,440
Alright, I queue at 25.

2109
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:32,300
If they don't...

2110
01:42:32,300 --> 01:42:35,220
If they don't come back...

2111
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:36,980
They're not at Gus.

2112
01:42:37,380 --> 01:42:38,980
The Doom queuing is strong.

2113
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:42,280
We're going to go straight into Doom queuing.

2114
01:42:43,180 --> 01:42:43,660
Now...

2115
01:42:43,660 --> 01:42:45,740
We lost our third.

2116
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:47,800
It ends in six days.

2117
01:42:47,960 --> 01:42:49,720
Oh my god, it ends in six days.

2118
01:42:49,820 --> 01:42:51,400
We actually have a timer now.

2119
01:42:51,820 --> 01:42:53,140
We can see when it ends.

2120
01:42:53,380 --> 01:42:55,700
Oh my god, I hope I can make it.

2121
01:42:56,140 --> 01:42:57,980
I hope I can make it.

2122
01:42:59,260 --> 01:43:00,960
Mac and Matt...

2123
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:02,880
Thank you for the Twitch Prime and Tier 1 sub.

2124
01:43:02,940 --> 01:43:03,820
Thank you, thank you.

2125
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:04,920
I really appreciate it.

2126
01:43:04,940 --> 01:43:06,080
Thank you so much.

2127
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:08,120
I really appreciate it, guys.

2128
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:10,280
Alright, it's almost 25.

2129
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:13,040
It's almost 25.

2130
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:15,940
I literally was like...

2131
01:43:15,940 --> 01:43:16,540
I've been like adding.

2132
01:43:16,780 --> 01:43:18,680
Where are you?

2133
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:20,340
Where did you go?

2134
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:25,400
You know MaxQ wasn't going to take fucking 20 minutes to finish.

2135
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:29,960
He's gone.

2136
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:31,100
He actually...

2137
01:43:31,100 --> 01:43:33,140
He's never coming back.

2138
01:43:33,140 --> 01:43:34,300
I hate that.

2139
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:35,680
Alright.

2140
01:43:36,820 --> 01:43:39,040
I guess we go in.

2141
01:43:40,520 --> 01:43:42,620
Alright, I'm a little scared now.

2142
01:43:43,440 --> 01:43:44,800
I'm a little scared now.

2143
01:43:45,120 --> 01:43:46,520
I was like, yeah, three stack.

2144
01:43:46,940 --> 01:43:48,220
I feel so comfortable.

2145
01:43:49,180 --> 01:43:51,560
At least I have two players to rely on.

2146
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:53,140
I guess it's just...

2147
01:43:53,660 --> 01:43:55,080
I don't know now.

2148
01:43:57,320 --> 01:43:58,780
I believe in him.

2149
01:43:59,420 --> 01:44:00,300
But then he told...

2150
01:44:00,300 --> 01:44:01,820
I was going to believe in him.

2151
01:44:02,540 --> 01:44:03,660
But then...

2152
01:44:03,660 --> 01:44:05,240
But then he's like...

2153
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:08,000
My games have been held the past three hours.

2154
01:44:08,220 --> 01:44:10,240
Went from 240 to 70.

2155
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:11,880
And then like...

2156
01:44:11,880 --> 01:44:13,820
Then I sort of stopped believing.

2157
01:44:14,580 --> 01:44:15,100
I don't know.

2158
01:44:15,180 --> 01:44:16,280
It's sort of hard to...

2159
01:44:16,280 --> 01:44:19,060
It's sort of hard to believe.

2160
01:44:20,780 --> 01:44:22,640
My optimism gone.

2161
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:27,780
My optimism gone.

2162
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:30,480
It's all gone.

2163
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:30,680
It's all gone.

2164
01:44:32,280 --> 01:44:34,080
The low key arc.

2165
01:44:37,620 --> 01:44:38,960
The believe only can...

2166
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:41,140
The believe can only work...

2167
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:44,060
Work at a certain amount.

2168
01:44:47,740 --> 01:44:48,880
I was a little optimistic.

2169
01:44:49,060 --> 01:44:49,920
I was optimistic.

2170
01:44:50,220 --> 01:44:51,460
Then everything went downhill.

2171
01:44:51,780 --> 01:44:53,240
Because I lost the third.

2172
01:44:54,020 --> 01:44:56,440
Kendrick Lamar disappeared on us.

2173
01:44:56,440 --> 01:44:57,820
And then...

2174
01:44:58,340 --> 01:45:00,960
Mac is not having a great rank session right now.

2175
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:09,620
So like...

2176
01:45:09,620 --> 01:45:10,240
Oh my gosh.

2177
01:45:10,340 --> 01:45:10,580
Wait.

2178
01:45:10,740 --> 01:45:13,020
Let me give you guys a natural prop review.

2179
01:45:14,660 --> 01:45:15,600
Where is he?

2180
01:45:17,380 --> 01:45:18,680
Where is he?

2181
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:20,140
Wait.

2182
01:45:20,200 --> 01:45:20,600
Actually.

2183
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:21,320
Where is he?

2184
01:45:22,640 --> 01:45:23,560
There you go.

2185
01:45:25,720 --> 01:45:27,300
There we go.

2186
01:45:27,580 --> 01:45:29,640
That's a real view right there.

2187
01:45:37,010 --> 01:45:39,590
There we go.

2188
01:45:41,550 --> 01:45:42,330
Woah.

2189
01:45:44,870 --> 01:45:48,650
The other ladies wish they were like Venom.

2190
01:45:49,610 --> 01:45:50,490
Venom.

2191
01:45:51,350 --> 01:45:52,030
Thank God.

2192
01:45:52,970 --> 01:45:55,610
Not my birthday so wild.

2193
01:45:55,870 --> 01:45:56,290
Okay.

2194
01:45:56,290 --> 01:45:57,570
Woah.

2195
01:45:58,350 --> 01:45:58,890
Mama.

2196
01:45:59,550 --> 01:46:01,010
Oh my God.

2197
01:46:01,530 --> 01:46:04,190
They wish they were...

2198
01:46:04,190 --> 01:46:06,130
They were...

2199
01:46:06,130 --> 01:46:07,810
As thick as Venom.

2200
01:46:17,470 --> 01:46:20,020
I missed third person.

2201
01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:22,680
Alright.

2202
01:46:25,050 --> 01:46:27,480
I have no idea who like...

2203
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:29,220
Majority of these people are in my lobby.

2204
01:46:29,220 --> 01:46:31,340
I forgot to get rid of East Coast.

2205
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,080
I forgot.

2206
01:46:38,120 --> 01:46:41,700
I forgot to get rid of East Coast.

2207
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:42,960
No.

2208
01:46:48,220 --> 01:46:52,000
I'm not used to being the party leader.

2209
01:46:52,820 --> 01:46:55,640
For those who don't know, people like...

2210
01:46:55,640 --> 01:46:57,660
Get rid of East Coast servers when they play.

2211
01:46:58,900 --> 01:46:59,620
Because like...

2212
01:46:59,620 --> 01:47:00,980
East Coast is like...

2213
01:47:00,980 --> 01:47:02,180
The Elo terrorizers.

2214
01:47:05,120 --> 01:47:07,280
Dude, I don't want to have a hell of my game bro.

2215
01:47:07,780 --> 01:47:10,040
The only games I've lost these...

2216
01:47:10,040 --> 01:47:10,640
I mean, I don't know.

2217
01:47:10,760 --> 01:47:12,660
The only games I've lost today is against...

2218
01:47:12,660 --> 01:47:13,220
Oh, there he is.

2219
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:18,680
Alright.

2220
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:20,120
Hawkeye.

2221
01:47:20,540 --> 01:47:20,900
Hawkeye.

2222
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:23,680
Goodbye Hawkeye.

2223
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:26,080
Bro, if I have to play against Hawkeye, I'm gonna...

2224
01:47:29,160 --> 01:47:29,600
Hawkeye.

2225
01:47:29,860 --> 01:47:30,300
Hawkeye.

2226
01:47:30,300 --> 01:47:30,780
I've had this.

2227
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:32,260
I've had to play against Hawkeye.

2228
01:47:32,500 --> 01:47:34,480
In five out of seven games.

2229
01:47:35,900 --> 01:47:37,140
Do they have a Hawkeye main?

2230
01:47:38,940 --> 01:47:39,980
I don't know.

2231
01:47:40,040 --> 01:47:42,380
But the Hawkeye always dropped fucking 30 kills or more.

2232
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:43,420
In like two deaths.

2233
01:47:45,660 --> 01:47:46,260
It was horrible.

2234
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:48,820
Why did you not tell me Kendrick Lamar went and took a shower?

2235
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:50,320
I'm sorry.

2236
01:47:51,380 --> 01:47:52,400
Drake's big hater.

2237
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:52,460
I'm sorry.

2238
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:01,840
Apparently they like typed it in chat.

2239
01:48:02,300 --> 01:48:03,460
It was like...

2240
01:48:03,460 --> 01:48:04,280
Bro, I typed it in chat.

2241
01:48:04,420 --> 01:48:06,120
I was like, I'm gonna go take a shower.

2242
01:48:09,660 --> 01:48:10,840
You guys didn't say anything.

2243
01:48:10,980 --> 01:48:11,700
I was like, where are you?

2244
01:48:14,740 --> 01:48:15,920
Yeah, he did.

2245
01:48:16,120 --> 01:48:17,580
Oh my god.

2246
01:48:17,680 --> 01:48:19,740
You guys should have spammed that.

2247
01:48:23,720 --> 01:48:24,760
They did it.

2248
01:48:25,240 --> 01:48:25,940
Who's we?

2249
01:48:27,080 --> 01:48:28,340
I didn't see it.

2250
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:29,920
So I don't think it existed.

2251
01:48:32,240 --> 01:48:33,260
Someone did though.

2252
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:35,020
Yeah, but it had to be a wall.

2253
01:48:35,860 --> 01:48:37,200
He's not gone.

2254
01:48:37,360 --> 01:48:38,080
He's out of shit.

2255
01:48:38,100 --> 01:48:40,520
I thought he disappeared.

2256
01:48:42,060 --> 01:48:44,500
Guys, the only way I can read it is if it's like...

2257
01:48:44,500 --> 01:48:45,940
If it's like the same thing.

2258
01:48:46,020 --> 01:48:47,520
Like ten times in a row.

2259
01:48:48,360 --> 01:48:49,480
See, I didn't see it.

2260
01:48:49,480 --> 01:48:50,040
There you go.

2261
01:48:51,380 --> 01:48:52,980
You did not spam it.

2262
01:48:53,060 --> 01:48:54,400
I fucking know you guys didn't.

2263
01:48:59,320 --> 01:49:01,160
I can't read either.

2264
01:49:01,700 --> 01:49:02,720
No, I can't.

2265
01:49:03,260 --> 01:49:04,500
I can't fucking read.

2266
01:49:07,080 --> 01:49:07,680
Alright.

2267
01:49:09,380 --> 01:49:10,300
Let's go.

2268
01:49:14,300 --> 01:49:15,760
Let's go, I believe.

2269
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:19,260
I push cart and I'm gonna believe so hard.

2270
01:49:19,260 --> 01:49:20,840
And like...

2271
01:49:20,840 --> 01:49:22,960
Things will be okay.

2272
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:24,320
Woah!

2273
01:49:28,180 --> 01:49:29,160
Oh my god.

2274
01:49:29,220 --> 01:49:31,320
I got no reg on that though.

2275
01:49:33,460 --> 01:49:34,720
You're so healthy!

2276
01:49:36,380 --> 01:49:37,600
I'm gonna put it on...

2277
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:38,680
Our tanks now.

2278
01:49:41,400 --> 01:49:43,920
I'm gonna be the only one that gets rid of the more shit.

2279
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:45,920
Okay, now I can put it on...

2280
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:46,860
I'm gonna put it on Starlord.

2281
01:49:46,860 --> 01:49:48,160
Because we have three supports.

2282
01:49:48,860 --> 01:49:51,040
So like...

2283
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:52,120
Please.

2284
01:49:52,420 --> 01:49:54,940
Why is he just chilling up there for free?

2285
01:49:55,560 --> 01:49:56,080
Please.

2286
01:49:56,440 --> 01:49:58,420
Oh my god, he's so healthy.

2287
01:49:58,980 --> 01:50:00,120
He's so healthy.

2288
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:01,280
You can Mass Assault first.

2289
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:03,900
Oh yeah.

2290
01:50:07,260 --> 01:50:08,420
Oh my god.

2291
01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:12,100
I froze Starlord, I froze Starlord.

2292
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:15,400
Okay.

2293
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:16,380
Oh my god, it doesn't matter.

2294
01:50:20,210 --> 01:50:20,930
Okay.

2295
01:50:23,010 --> 01:50:26,630
Can we make any progress?

2296
01:50:27,070 --> 01:50:28,150
Let's find out.

2297
01:50:31,050 --> 01:50:32,330
Let's find out.

2298
01:50:35,010 --> 01:50:35,310
Oh!

2299
01:50:36,610 --> 01:50:37,530
Oh!

2300
01:50:37,990 --> 01:50:40,570
You're all so alive.

2301
01:50:40,730 --> 01:50:41,690
For somehow.

2302
01:50:41,690 --> 01:50:42,050
Somehow.

2303
01:50:42,930 --> 01:50:43,530
Somehow.

2304
01:50:45,550 --> 01:50:47,690
Can we kill...

2305
01:50:49,670 --> 01:50:54,430
Oh my god, please.

2306
01:50:56,170 --> 01:50:57,550
Wait, there's a Starlord behind me.

2307
01:50:57,570 --> 01:50:58,330
Starlord behind us.

2308
01:51:00,790 --> 01:51:01,750
Starlord half.

2309
01:51:03,930 --> 01:51:05,870
I have Starlord behind us.

2310
01:51:07,450 --> 01:51:09,470
Oh my god, please!

2311
01:51:09,470 --> 01:51:13,110
How is he still alive?!

2312
01:51:13,110 --> 01:51:14,310
Starlord 1 HP on the top.

2313
01:51:17,710 --> 01:51:19,310
Ah, somebody shoot him!

2314
01:51:19,730 --> 01:51:20,830
I shot him!

2315
01:51:24,970 --> 01:51:26,690
Oh my god!

2316
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,420
My dad keeps shooting him!

2317
01:51:34,860 --> 01:51:36,620
Oh, that's unlucky.

2318
01:51:38,020 --> 01:51:38,780
Unlucky.

2319
01:51:40,280 --> 01:51:41,860
Oh, that's so unlucky.

2320
01:51:42,780 --> 01:51:44,300
That is...

2321
01:51:44,300 --> 01:51:46,720
I peeled so much.

2322
01:51:49,680 --> 01:51:52,320
Oh my god, and then there's a Wolverine?!

2323
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:56,660
Where did he come from?!

2324
01:51:58,760 --> 01:51:59,520
Guys...

2325
01:52:01,260 --> 01:52:02,020
I'm...

2326
01:52:02,660 --> 01:52:04,800
I'm not feeling hopeful anymore.

2327
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:05,540
I'm...

2328
01:52:08,660 --> 01:52:09,240
I'm above.

2329
01:52:10,620 --> 01:52:11,480
Alright.

2330
01:52:14,530 --> 01:52:15,160
Who's running?

2331
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:16,900
Just play around it on me.

2332
01:52:18,420 --> 01:52:19,280
Alright.

2333
01:52:20,780 --> 01:52:21,420
Alright.

2334
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:24,420
My ult ending here.

2335
01:52:27,480 --> 01:52:30,380
Oh my god, why did you push up?!

2336
01:52:30,380 --> 01:52:30,980
Wolverine's low.

2337
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:33,820
What?!

2338
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:35,660
Wait!

2339
01:52:36,360 --> 01:52:37,910
Oh my god!

2340
01:52:38,280 --> 01:52:42,220
Why did you push up?!

2341
01:52:42,220 --> 01:52:44,300
We can combine Mantis ult.

2342
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:45,680
Mantis, you ready?

2343
01:52:47,490 --> 01:52:48,740
I need you to help me though.

2344
01:52:49,340 --> 01:52:50,180
We're attaching, Siren.

2345
01:52:52,500 --> 01:52:53,200
Alright.

2346
01:52:53,960 --> 01:52:54,300
Alright.

2347
01:52:55,240 --> 01:52:57,040
Wolverine's behind us.

2348
01:52:58,720 --> 01:52:59,560
This is weird.

2349
01:53:05,400 --> 01:53:07,640
No, I had...

2350
01:53:07,640 --> 01:53:08,840
Oh my god.

2351
01:53:09,980 --> 01:53:11,560
I think...

2352
01:53:12,100 --> 01:53:13,540
Guys, does this look like...

2353
01:53:13,540 --> 01:53:14,500
a winning queue?

2354
01:53:15,040 --> 01:53:16,960
This is...

2355
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:20,180
Hey, wait, there's a portal!

2356
01:53:26,450 --> 01:53:28,730
Oh my god, Wolverine's low!

2357
01:53:33,430 --> 01:53:35,630
That was my bad shit, waking up Wolverine.

2358
01:53:38,350 --> 01:53:41,090
Guys, I got into max doom queues.

2359
01:53:41,730 --> 01:53:49,010
It is what it is.

2360
01:53:49,290 --> 01:53:51,750
It is what it is.

2361
01:53:56,690 --> 01:53:57,550
It's fine.

2362
01:53:58,070 --> 01:54:00,930
Surely we can turn around max doom queues.

2363
01:54:01,970 --> 01:54:03,050
I think we can.

2364
01:54:03,050 --> 01:54:05,290
I think it's possible.

2365
01:54:06,830 --> 01:54:07,990
Their queues...

2366
01:54:07,990 --> 01:54:08,930
Their que...

2367
01:54:08,930 --> 01:54:10,590
The queues can't be doomed forever.

2368
01:54:11,270 --> 01:54:11,830
I...

2369
01:54:11,830 --> 01:54:15,730
It can't be doomed forever.

2370
01:54:16,370 --> 01:54:17,130
There's like...

2371
01:54:17,130 --> 01:54:19,450
At one point, it turns around, guys.

2372
01:54:19,650 --> 01:54:20,950
At one point.

2373
01:54:22,450 --> 01:54:24,650
Oh my god, I'm gonna be GM one, guys.

2374
01:54:24,830 --> 01:54:25,650
Oh my god.

2375
01:54:26,330 --> 01:54:27,230
I'm so excited.

2376
01:54:27,950 --> 01:54:30,150
That makes it easier, right?

2377
01:54:30,150 --> 01:54:31,410
That's how it goes.

2378
01:54:31,870 --> 01:54:35,050
Games get easier when you're in GM one.

2379
01:54:38,950 --> 01:54:39,550
Right?

2380
01:54:40,250 --> 01:54:41,410
Right, guys?

2381
01:54:44,070 --> 01:54:44,670
Right?

2382
01:54:45,150 --> 01:54:48,030
Is that what we're...

2383
01:54:49,270 --> 01:54:51,510
Okay, we still have...

2384
01:54:51,510 --> 01:54:52,550
We still have a tank.

2385
01:54:54,070 --> 01:54:57,570
Surely I won't drop all the way to GM two like that guy.

2386
01:54:57,570 --> 01:54:58,890
That poor guy.

2387
01:54:59,110 --> 01:55:00,870
That really poor guy.

2388
01:55:03,370 --> 01:55:06,390
My ego has already been really small.

2389
01:55:08,230 --> 01:55:11,850
I say as I fucking scream at a Rocket Raccoon player yesterday.

2390
01:55:14,510 --> 01:55:15,670
It's as small as...

2391
01:55:15,670 --> 01:55:17,590
It's smaller than a DPS player.

2392
01:55:17,910 --> 01:55:19,290
Like, no matter what.

2393
01:55:26,070 --> 01:55:29,350
Oh, you are so healthy though.

2394
01:55:29,930 --> 01:55:31,070
You're so healthy.

2395
01:55:31,250 --> 01:55:32,190
I clapped.

2396
01:55:34,430 --> 01:55:34,790
What?

2397
01:55:35,510 --> 01:55:35,610
Oh.

2398
01:55:37,710 --> 01:55:40,110
Bro, he got bubbled?

2399
01:55:41,150 --> 01:55:42,510
Oh my god.

2400
01:55:45,010 --> 01:55:46,890
Guys, I can't clap again.

2401
01:55:46,890 --> 01:55:48,570
I can't clap again.

2402
01:55:48,710 --> 01:55:49,430
I'm sorry.

2403
01:55:49,730 --> 01:55:52,610
I tried so hard to clap.

2404
01:55:59,690 --> 01:56:03,110
I'm clapping as fast as I can.

2405
01:56:06,510 --> 01:56:07,970
Clapping is so hard.

2406
01:56:08,230 --> 01:56:08,950
It hurts.

2407
01:56:17,230 --> 01:56:18,410
Oh my god.

2408
01:56:18,490 --> 01:56:20,570
Clap, clap, clap.

2409
01:56:21,250 --> 01:56:21,910
Clap, clap.

2410
01:56:21,970 --> 01:56:23,290
I can feel it.

2411
01:56:24,530 --> 01:56:26,470
I can fucking feel it.

2412
01:56:26,730 --> 01:56:27,730
I feel the kidnapping.

2413
01:56:28,310 --> 01:56:29,650
Oh my god.

2414
01:56:31,010 --> 01:56:31,670
Oh,

2415
01:56:34,710 --> 01:56:35,370
you know who's...

2416
01:56:44,290 --> 01:56:46,290
Oh my god.

2417
01:56:51,420 --> 01:56:53,160
Oh my god.

2418
01:56:53,180 --> 01:56:53,360
Okay.

2419
01:56:53,360 --> 01:56:56,120
I don't know how they all died.

2420
01:56:58,040 --> 01:56:58,920
Ow.

2421
01:57:04,240 --> 01:57:07,160
Oh my god.

2422
01:57:08,820 --> 01:57:09,580
Oh my god.

2423
01:57:09,580 --> 01:57:09,820
It's okay.

2424
01:57:10,780 --> 01:57:12,540
We got Kendrick Lamar back.

2425
01:57:12,980 --> 01:57:16,260
Oh my god.

2426
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:17,920
Fucking get rid of... I'm sorry.

2427
01:57:18,020 --> 01:57:19,360
I'm deleting the east coast.

2428
01:57:19,860 --> 01:57:20,320
I...

2429
01:57:21,160 --> 01:57:22,820
Like I said.

2430
01:57:25,020 --> 01:57:25,820
It's okay.

2431
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:29,680
I'm deleting the east coast.

2432
01:57:29,800 --> 01:57:30,380
Don't worry.

2433
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:34,860
Oh, that hurts.

2434
01:57:34,860 --> 01:57:36,040
That actually hurts.

2435
01:57:37,800 --> 01:57:39,280
I'm sorry, east coast.

2436
01:57:39,440 --> 01:57:41,480
But your lobbies are known as like...

2437
01:57:41,480 --> 01:57:43,020
The terrorizing lobbies.

2438
01:57:43,160 --> 01:57:43,940
As they are.

2439
01:57:49,240 --> 01:57:51,340
Your lobbies are actual.

2440
01:57:51,860 --> 01:57:52,740
I'm sorry.

2441
01:57:52,980 --> 01:57:53,520
I'm sorry.

2442
01:57:53,700 --> 01:57:55,600
I gotta remove you.

2443
01:57:55,740 --> 01:57:57,840
I gotta remove you.

2444
01:57:59,900 --> 01:58:00,580
Alright.

2445
01:58:01,040 --> 01:58:01,620
Honestly.

2446
01:58:01,620 --> 01:58:01,900
Honestly.

2447
01:58:02,380 --> 01:58:04,380
I don't even know who.

2448
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:05,940
They...

2449
01:58:05,940 --> 01:58:08,220
Everybody was just terrible.

2450
01:58:08,440 --> 01:58:09,060
I don't know.

2451
01:58:10,100 --> 01:58:12,440
Who was the worst one?

2452
01:58:13,020 --> 01:58:13,560
I don't know.

2453
01:58:13,640 --> 01:58:14,760
They were all pretty fucking...

2454
01:58:14,760 --> 01:58:16,420
Oh my gosh.

2455
01:58:16,540 --> 01:58:19,020
I don't know.

2456
01:58:19,220 --> 01:58:20,720
They were all pretty special.

2457
01:58:22,120 --> 01:58:24,260
The rocket raccoon.

2458
01:58:24,680 --> 01:58:26,280
To be fair, he was on Mantis.

2459
01:58:26,380 --> 01:58:28,220
To be fair.

2460
01:58:28,220 --> 01:58:29,340
Like...

2461
01:58:29,340 --> 01:58:30,440
I don't know.

2462
01:58:31,580 --> 01:58:33,520
He was on support too.

2463
01:58:34,440 --> 01:58:35,000
Like...

2464
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:36,800
Was the rocket that bad?

2465
01:58:37,040 --> 01:58:38,260
He was on Mantis.

2466
01:58:38,340 --> 01:58:39,080
To be fair.

2467
01:58:40,980 --> 01:58:42,680
Avoid the rocket on principle.

2468
01:58:42,920 --> 01:58:43,420
I'm sorry.

2469
01:58:43,800 --> 01:58:44,920
The chat has voted.

2470
01:58:45,880 --> 01:58:47,220
I didn't want to avoid you.

2471
01:58:47,320 --> 01:58:48,760
But chat was just like...

2472
01:58:48,760 --> 01:58:49,800
Just avoid him.

2473
01:58:50,320 --> 01:58:54,140
I don't like being party leader.

2474
01:58:54,140 --> 01:58:55,380
It's too much pressure.

2475
01:58:56,240 --> 01:58:58,420
Why would I give somebody party leader?

2476
01:59:00,260 --> 01:59:01,460
Oh, I'll do it later.

2477
01:59:02,100 --> 01:59:04,140
Chat demands a sacrifice.

2478
01:59:05,740 --> 01:59:06,340
It's not...

2479
01:59:06,660 --> 01:59:08,160
It wasn't my decision.

2480
01:59:08,340 --> 01:59:09,900
The chat voted for you to...

2481
01:59:09,900 --> 01:59:11,760
For you to get avoided.

2482
01:59:12,220 --> 01:59:13,480
Just so they know.

2483
01:59:14,040 --> 01:59:16,320
I didn't want to do it.

2484
01:59:16,380 --> 01:59:16,700
Alright?

2485
01:59:16,840 --> 01:59:17,820
It wasn't...

2486
01:59:17,820 --> 01:59:20,860
It wasn't my choice.

2487
01:59:20,860 --> 01:59:21,820
Okay.

2488
01:59:25,640 --> 01:59:26,620
There we go.

2489
01:59:28,140 --> 01:59:28,940
The true...

2490
01:59:28,940 --> 01:59:30,220
Eye candy here.

2491
01:59:31,420 --> 01:59:32,300
This is what we want.

2492
01:59:32,360 --> 01:59:33,620
Just give the people what they want.

2493
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:35,920
I heard the new ice skin...

2494
01:59:35,920 --> 01:59:36,540
Is like...

2495
01:59:36,540 --> 01:59:40,080
Like a bigger bulge.

2496
01:59:44,720 --> 01:59:45,580
Oh, pervert?

2497
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:46,640
Oh yeah.

2498
01:59:46,780 --> 01:59:48,440
Just because I picked Venom.

2499
01:59:49,160 --> 01:59:52,380
If I had Luna Snow.

2500
01:59:52,540 --> 01:59:53,760
Or Cloak and Dagger.

2501
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:55,120
Or Squirrel Girl.

2502
01:59:55,480 --> 01:59:55,880
Nope.

2503
01:59:56,180 --> 01:59:59,580
But when I choose Venom.

2504
01:59:59,840 --> 02:00:01,480
I get judged.

2505
02:00:05,320 --> 02:00:08,160
Just because I picked Venom.

2506
02:00:09,060 --> 02:00:10,760
I'm getting judged.

2507
02:00:13,660 --> 02:00:16,740
All cake is good cake.

2508
02:00:18,180 --> 02:00:19,220
Society.

2509
02:00:20,280 --> 02:00:22,020
Venom is an...

2510
02:00:22,020 --> 02:00:23,340
An...

2511
02:00:24,020 --> 02:00:25,520
Fucking half the...

2512
02:00:25,520 --> 02:00:27,380
Half the fucking roster...

2513
02:00:27,380 --> 02:00:29,240
Aren't even real humans.

2514
02:00:29,600 --> 02:00:32,260
They're not even fucking humans.

2515
02:00:32,740 --> 02:00:34,360
They're metahumans.

2516
02:00:34,720 --> 02:00:36,080
And they don't deserve...

2517
02:00:40,600 --> 02:00:42,100
And metahumans...

2518
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:43,840
Aren't...

2519
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:44,280
Okay.

2520
02:00:49,040 --> 02:00:49,880
Sorry.

2521
02:00:53,900 --> 02:00:55,580
Mutants, metahumans.

2522
02:00:55,660 --> 02:00:57,300
They're like the fucking same thing.

2523
02:00:58,360 --> 02:01:00,280
They all don't...

2524
02:01:01,960 --> 02:01:03,740
Don't go there.

2525
02:01:05,940 --> 02:01:08,380
It's literally the same thing.

2526
02:01:08,780 --> 02:01:10,180
Just different names.

2527
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:13,460
Same prejudice.

2528
02:01:17,800 --> 02:01:20,560
The Tarvis didn't leave the bot.

2529
02:01:21,120 --> 02:01:23,000
She hit my head.

2530
02:01:23,700 --> 02:01:26,040
That D.Va was right.

2531
02:01:26,620 --> 02:01:29,720
That D.Va was right.

2532
02:01:29,720 --> 02:01:35,040
Did you not watch X-Men?

2533
02:01:36,040 --> 02:01:37,020
Oh my god.

2534
02:01:37,020 --> 02:01:37,080
Oh my god.

2535
02:01:37,900 --> 02:01:40,020
Oh, this is a weird last fucking lobby.

2536
02:01:40,740 --> 02:01:42,160
We removed East Coast.

2537
02:01:42,640 --> 02:01:45,280
We cut off the East Coast.

2538
02:01:51,380 --> 02:01:53,340
Mutants aren't even real!

2539
02:01:53,940 --> 02:01:55,840
Why are we defending mutants?

2540
02:01:56,060 --> 02:01:57,240
They're not even real!

2541
02:02:01,180 --> 02:02:03,180
Doki's gotta get cancelled.

2542
02:02:03,180 --> 02:02:03,960
Cancelled.

2543
02:02:04,780 --> 02:02:06,640
Cause they're friends.

2544
02:02:07,740 --> 02:02:09,520
They're not even real!

2545
02:02:13,680 --> 02:02:14,300
Woah!

2546
02:02:15,440 --> 02:02:18,080
They're not real people now!

2547
02:02:18,820 --> 02:02:19,720
Woah!

2548
02:02:21,420 --> 02:02:25,680
The mutant erasers shake my head!

2549
02:02:27,260 --> 02:02:30,880
I'm batting mantles cause we have Cloak and Dagger players.

2550
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:32,260
So fuck that.

2551
02:02:37,510 --> 02:02:40,150
Nookie claims they're not real humans.

2552
02:02:42,110 --> 02:02:45,410
I knew they were gonna ban Hela so I was just like, I'm just gonna ban this guy.

2553
02:02:48,450 --> 02:02:49,710
Are you batting her?

2554
02:02:49,890 --> 02:02:52,710
Cause she's a She's a fucking alien!

2555
02:02:55,130 --> 02:02:56,170
That's different.

2556
02:02:58,170 --> 02:02:59,050
That's different.

2557
02:02:59,370 --> 02:03:01,430
And we all appreciate aliens here.

2558
02:03:01,430 --> 02:03:03,720
We all appreciate aliens.

2559
02:03:04,230 --> 02:03:07,630
That's why I'm a Venom enjoyer.

2560
02:03:08,110 --> 02:03:11,590
I'm about to get cancelled on xmen.com.

2561
02:03:11,990 --> 02:03:15,090
I should've banned Neknito.

2562
02:03:15,730 --> 02:03:17,910
Should've just banned all the xmen characters.

2563
02:03:21,630 --> 02:03:24,650
Doki's playing a mutant she can't possibly.

2564
02:03:24,650 --> 02:03:24,730
She can't possibly.

2565
02:03:28,370 --> 02:03:29,990
No, Luna Snow is different.

2566
02:03:30,330 --> 02:03:32,990
She's my exception.

2567
02:03:34,910 --> 02:03:36,530
She's a K-pop star.

2568
02:03:36,670 --> 02:03:39,750
She's a celebrity.

2569
02:03:41,010 --> 02:03:42,430
She's a K-pop star.

2570
02:03:42,550 --> 02:03:43,190
She's different.

2571
02:03:54,650 --> 02:03:56,910
Her music's good, so it's different.

2572
02:03:58,910 --> 02:04:00,970
She's not like the other mutants.

2573
02:04:05,010 --> 02:04:07,930
Yeah, she got her powers from a snow machine.

2574
02:04:08,610 --> 02:04:09,890
It's different.

2575
02:04:10,790 --> 02:04:11,690
Oh, fuck.

2576
02:04:11,810 --> 02:04:12,350
Okay, cute.

2577
02:04:15,930 --> 02:04:18,710
Name one Luna Snow song.

2578
02:04:22,810 --> 02:04:24,790
Yeah, you test me on that.

2579
02:04:28,870 --> 02:04:32,290
Bit by a radioactive snowflake.

2580
02:04:32,290 --> 02:04:33,710
Help our Starlord.

2581
02:04:36,130 --> 02:04:38,670
I got her tank.

2582
02:04:47,010 --> 02:04:48,410
I froze, I froze.

2583
02:04:48,570 --> 02:04:50,950
There's a Panther, any help?

2584
02:04:53,990 --> 02:04:55,490
That was a sick freeze.

2585
02:04:56,330 --> 02:04:59,590
You see, this is why Luna's my exception.

2586
02:05:04,130 --> 02:05:06,190
I need to be topped off here.

2587
02:05:08,790 --> 02:05:10,330
That's fucking right.

2588
02:05:11,090 --> 02:05:12,470
Now you know why.

2589
02:05:19,860 --> 02:05:20,960
That's fine.

2590
02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:23,140
Two, no more, two left.

2591
02:05:27,420 --> 02:05:29,420
Yeah, they're above me.

2592
02:05:29,420 --> 02:05:30,720
I'm countering, girl.

2593
02:05:33,460 --> 02:05:35,220
There's a strange pushing me.

2594
02:05:36,660 --> 02:05:39,880
Oh, no!

2595
02:05:40,840 --> 02:05:42,340
They all pushed me!

2596
02:05:42,740 --> 02:05:43,840
I couldn't help!

2597
02:05:47,600 --> 02:05:48,300
Uh...

2598
02:05:48,300 --> 02:05:49,820
You're down one.

2599
02:05:51,720 --> 02:05:52,700
Oh, wait, nevermind.

2600
02:05:52,780 --> 02:05:54,180
You're down two.

2601
02:05:55,200 --> 02:05:58,740
If you guys can regroup, I can ult in.

2602
02:06:00,920 --> 02:06:01,760
Mac, live, live, live.

2603
02:06:01,820 --> 02:06:02,300
I'm ulting in.

2604
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:05,600
Oh, my god.

2605
02:06:10,250 --> 02:06:10,610
Alright.

2606
02:06:11,150 --> 02:06:12,670
I have to back out in two seconds.

2607
02:06:12,850 --> 02:06:13,310
Backing out now.

2608
02:06:15,670 --> 02:06:17,150
They have a strange ult, they have a strange ult.

2609
02:06:20,570 --> 02:06:22,870
I froze strange, but I'm ulted too.

2610
02:06:24,530 --> 02:06:25,770
Oh, my god!

2611
02:06:29,540 --> 02:06:32,720
That was such a good freeze!

2612
02:06:35,900 --> 02:06:39,760
That was actually a great freeze, too.

2613
02:06:43,870 --> 02:06:46,170
Poor me and the guy.

2614
02:06:51,490 --> 02:06:53,770
God damn it, if I can kill Vanita.

2615
02:06:56,090 --> 02:06:57,190
Damn ult.

2616
02:06:57,190 --> 02:06:57,910
Oh...

2617
02:07:02,980 --> 02:07:05,400
Bro, I can't...

2618
02:07:07,420 --> 02:07:08,640
Oh, my god.

2619
02:07:09,440 --> 02:07:11,640
Oh, I can't do anything!

2620
02:07:12,340 --> 02:07:12,620
No!

2621
02:07:12,680 --> 02:07:13,540
I'm sorry!

2622
02:07:17,020 --> 02:07:17,880
Oh,

2623
02:07:21,920 --> 02:07:22,700
my god.

2624
02:07:24,400 --> 02:07:25,960
Oh, my god.

2625
02:07:25,960 --> 02:07:28,580
Poor me and the guy.

2626
02:07:30,860 --> 02:07:31,540
What?

2627
02:07:37,740 --> 02:07:39,140
Oh, that's ours?

2628
02:07:41,260 --> 02:07:43,740
I didn't realize that was our ult.

2629
02:07:43,960 --> 02:07:45,240
I thought...

2630
02:07:45,240 --> 02:07:46,340
There's a match behind us.

2631
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:50,300
We're up two.

2632
02:07:50,680 --> 02:07:51,300
We should push up.

2633
02:07:52,420 --> 02:07:53,820
I'm on cloak as well.

2634
02:08:02,700 --> 02:08:04,340
Respawns are coming back in front of us.

2635
02:08:06,100 --> 02:08:07,280
I'm ulting, I'm ulting this.

2636
02:08:12,440 --> 02:08:13,780
Oh, the Sylas coming back now.

2637
02:08:15,360 --> 02:08:16,340
I'm backing up now.

2638
02:08:19,980 --> 02:08:20,920
Oh, they...

2639
02:08:20,920 --> 02:08:21,600
Yeah.

2640
02:08:23,820 --> 02:08:25,040
That was not...

2641
02:08:26,080 --> 02:08:29,420
I saw the Magneto, I was like, you're not living that.

2642
02:08:29,800 --> 02:08:31,240
You're not...

2643
02:08:31,740 --> 02:08:32,220
Bro...

2644
02:08:32,220 --> 02:08:34,040
Poor me and the guy.

2645
02:08:35,360 --> 02:08:38,240
Why does this always happens to me?

2646
02:08:38,320 --> 02:08:39,580
Every time I...

2647
02:08:40,220 --> 02:08:41,600
Every time I hate.

2648
02:08:41,940 --> 02:08:43,240
Guys, just don't be a hater.

2649
02:08:45,780 --> 02:08:49,300
I just gotta stop being a hater, I guess.

2650
02:08:51,480 --> 02:08:53,120
Guys, I'm reformed.

2651
02:08:53,160 --> 02:08:54,280
I love mutants.

2652
02:08:55,320 --> 02:08:57,800
I love all mutant kind.

2653
02:08:59,180 --> 02:09:22,780
In fact, I'm gonna make a donation now to Professor Xavier's School of Mutants because I've learned about I believe in all mutant kind and my donation to Professor Xavier's Mutant School shall show how much I believe in them.

2654
02:09:28,080 --> 02:09:31,860
Professor X's award cramping up.

2655
02:09:32,660 --> 02:09:33,460
Psylocke has ult.

2656
02:09:35,600 --> 02:09:36,940
Guys, pick one!

2657
02:09:38,360 --> 02:09:40,620
Do we fight for mutants or not?

2658
02:09:42,740 --> 02:09:46,520
Fake apology because of the backlash.

2659
02:09:47,060 --> 02:09:48,280
That's not true.

2660
02:09:48,400 --> 02:09:50,180
I believe in all mutants.

2661
02:09:50,920 --> 02:09:52,460
Believe mutants.

2662
02:09:57,070 --> 02:09:58,490
Oh my god.

2663
02:09:58,730 --> 02:09:59,510
Please live.

2664
02:09:59,510 --> 02:10:01,010
Oh, except for you.

2665
02:10:01,150 --> 02:10:03,470
Fuck you, I guess.

2666
02:10:04,030 --> 02:10:06,850
Bring out the ukulele.

2667
02:10:08,130 --> 02:10:09,530
Oh no.

2668
02:10:09,890 --> 02:10:12,330
Oh, what do I do there?

2669
02:10:13,030 --> 02:10:15,090
I fucking apologized!

2670
02:10:17,910 --> 02:10:20,330
I fucking apologized!

2671
02:10:22,770 --> 02:10:24,310
What more do you want?

2672
02:10:28,430 --> 02:10:29,710
We gotta touch.

2673
02:10:31,790 --> 02:10:36,310
Please, I had to touch myself.

2674
02:10:41,680 --> 02:10:42,920
Jesus Christ.

2675
02:10:48,710 --> 02:10:50,290
Oh my god.

2676
02:10:51,110 --> 02:10:51,490
Please.

2677
02:10:53,370 --> 02:10:54,190
Oh my god.

2678
02:10:54,450 --> 02:10:54,810
Please.

2679
02:10:55,490 --> 02:10:56,250
Magneto's low.

2680
02:10:56,330 --> 02:10:57,950
Magneto's low.

2681
02:11:04,230 --> 02:11:05,410
Stay on point, please.

2682
02:11:05,570 --> 02:11:06,210
It's point 50.

2683
02:11:08,630 --> 02:11:09,770
Oh my god, okay.

2684
02:11:10,030 --> 02:11:10,590
There we go.

2685
02:11:13,150 --> 02:11:14,430
It's personal.

2686
02:11:16,650 --> 02:11:19,130
I believe in their existence.

2687
02:11:19,490 --> 02:11:21,530
What more do they want from me?

2688
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:32,260
I don't have my ult, so if you guys can let me, help me build ult.

2689
02:11:33,920 --> 02:11:35,800
I'm 10% from ult.

2690
02:11:48,560 --> 02:11:49,360
I'm 2%.

2691
02:11:59,850 --> 02:12:00,250
Oh.

2692
02:12:01,330 --> 02:12:02,590
Right on point if you have to.

2693
02:12:04,030 --> 02:12:04,710
I can ult those enemies.

2694
02:12:05,190 --> 02:12:07,010
They're gonna Psylocke ult right after.

2695
02:12:10,690 --> 02:12:12,970
Oh, they have Psylocke ult and Strange ult.

2696
02:12:16,570 --> 02:12:17,830
No more ult.

2697
02:12:20,830 --> 02:12:21,610
Magneto's one.

2698
02:12:22,090 --> 02:12:23,410
Oh, never mind.

2699
02:12:24,250 --> 02:12:25,410
Stay on point if you can.

2700
02:12:29,090 --> 02:12:30,270
Oh, nice!

2701
02:12:30,350 --> 02:12:31,010
Let's go!

2702
02:12:34,230 --> 02:12:35,290
There we go.

2703
02:12:36,270 --> 02:12:36,770
Alright.

2704
02:12:37,190 --> 02:12:38,810
We win this and I was justified.

2705
02:12:39,190 --> 02:12:39,810
I was right.

2706
02:12:48,130 --> 02:12:49,450
Wait, what?

2707
02:12:50,550 --> 02:12:52,570
She wasn't sorry.

2708
02:12:57,810 --> 02:12:59,110
I'm not dumping.

2709
02:12:59,310 --> 02:13:01,590
If Magneto wins this, then he was right.

2710
02:13:01,710 --> 02:13:03,890
If I win this, then I was right.

2711
02:13:04,650 --> 02:13:06,930
Two-faced apology.

2712
02:13:07,790 --> 02:13:08,270
Right here.

2713
02:13:09,510 --> 02:13:11,070
Mag on Starlord.

2714
02:13:11,150 --> 02:13:13,190
Yeah, Mag's really good at Starlord.

2715
02:13:13,190 --> 02:13:16,430
Yeah, the whiplash is crazy.

2716
02:13:17,350 --> 02:13:21,910
Namor is not immune and he's a fucking, he's an Atlantean.

2717
02:13:22,090 --> 02:13:22,890
That's different.

2718
02:13:23,330 --> 02:13:25,690
That's different and he's hot too.

2719
02:13:27,270 --> 02:13:29,110
Bro, I cannot wait for it.

2720
02:13:29,230 --> 02:13:37,190
Apparently, Namor and Mrs. Fantastic has like a history behind each other so I can't wait.

2721
02:13:37,490 --> 02:13:38,410
I can't wait to see.

2722
02:13:38,490 --> 02:13:42,250
I wanna know if they actually know the history behind Namor and Mrs. Fantastic.

2723
02:13:47,170 --> 02:13:48,210
He's a, no!

2724
02:13:48,410 --> 02:13:49,730
He's more Atlantean.

2725
02:13:52,050 --> 02:13:54,590
Wait, does Mrs. Fantastic know?

2726
02:13:55,070 --> 02:13:57,670
I don't know, but I'm pulling up a chair for him.

2727
02:14:02,150 --> 02:14:04,350
He can be two things.

2728
02:14:11,310 --> 02:14:12,670
Yes, oh yeah, yeah.

2729
02:14:12,830 --> 02:14:15,690
He has, Namor and Mrs. Fantastic has a thing going on.

2730
02:14:15,810 --> 02:14:23,050
I don't know how Mr. Fantastic's gonna feel, but I mean like look at Mr. Fantastic and then look at Namor.

2731
02:14:26,750 --> 02:14:28,650
Like, can you really blame her?

2732
02:14:29,170 --> 02:14:29,510
Can you?

2733
02:14:30,950 --> 02:14:31,990
Oh, we're even.

2734
02:14:39,930 --> 02:14:40,890
There's a...

2735
02:14:40,890 --> 02:14:43,030
Oh my!

2736
02:14:47,630 --> 02:14:51,950
Okay, but like, but like in comparison with the two.

2737
02:14:53,390 --> 02:14:56,470
Okay, but also look at Mrs. Fantastic.

2738
02:14:57,730 --> 02:14:58,810
You really

2739
02:15:05,180 --> 02:15:05,920
blame...

2740
02:15:08,360 --> 02:15:09,380
We're even.

2741
02:15:10,260 --> 02:15:11,780
We're up one, we're up one.

2742
02:15:15,180 --> 02:15:16,320
Oh my god.

2743
02:15:16,600 --> 02:15:18,340
I froze somebody, I think.

2744
02:15:23,180 --> 02:15:24,860
Feels bad for him.

2745
02:15:27,140 --> 02:15:28,700
We're down two, we're down two.

2746
02:15:31,320 --> 02:15:32,880
There's no point in ulting this.

2747
02:15:41,060 --> 02:15:43,740
Alright, we have two DPS coming over now.

2748
02:15:46,420 --> 02:15:46,740
Oh!

2749
02:15:47,280 --> 02:15:48,800
Okay, I'll ult in, I'll ult in.

2750
02:15:49,300 --> 02:15:49,820
I'm ulting.

2751
02:15:52,040 --> 02:15:54,620
You guys gotta win here.

2752
02:15:54,760 --> 02:15:55,140
They have no luna.

2753
02:15:56,360 --> 02:15:57,520
That's a huge ult, that's a huge ult!

2754
02:15:57,740 --> 02:15:58,120
Oh, magic.

2755
02:15:59,660 --> 02:16:03,540
Goodbye, I might die!

2756
02:16:10,900 --> 02:16:11,320
Okay.

2757
02:16:11,320 --> 02:16:12,500
There's so many I have to kill.

2758
02:16:12,920 --> 02:16:13,740
Oh my gosh.

2759
02:16:17,640 --> 02:16:19,980
Okay, strange has ult, strange has ult and they have support ults here.

2760
02:16:23,720 --> 02:16:24,520
Oh, nice.

2761
02:16:25,220 --> 02:16:26,440
Alright, there we go!

2762
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:30,320
Get her, Mania, stop!

2763
02:16:33,300 --> 02:16:36,280
What did I do to deserve this?

2764
02:16:36,420 --> 02:16:38,160
I say it as I...

2765
02:16:39,980 --> 02:16:42,000
I say it as I...

2766
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,300
I say this about Mutant.

2767
02:16:45,920 --> 02:16:49,540
I'm just saying what everybody's saying out loud.

2768
02:16:50,760 --> 02:16:52,740
Wait, oh no.

2769
02:16:53,120 --> 02:16:55,420
Maybe I did deserve to lose this.

2770
02:16:56,020 --> 02:16:58,320
What the fuck?

2771
02:16:58,320 --> 02:17:00,180
What happened to my...

2772
02:17:00,180 --> 02:17:01,500
No way!

2773
02:17:01,780 --> 02:17:03,520
This is...

2774
02:17:03,520 --> 02:17:05,180
No way!

2775
02:17:07,880 --> 02:17:08,920
Oh my god.

2776
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,300
No fucking way.

2777
02:17:13,040 --> 02:17:14,200
This is...

2778
02:17:14,200 --> 02:17:16,560
Oh my god, this is crazy.

2779
02:17:17,840 --> 02:17:20,160
Oh, I'm solo healing, I know there's a point to see.

2780
02:17:22,420 --> 02:17:24,080
This is crazy.

2781
02:17:24,680 --> 02:17:26,160
This is actually crazy.

2782
02:17:26,160 --> 02:17:28,040
I can't believe it.

2783
02:17:28,040 --> 02:17:29,620
I can't believe it.

2784
02:17:29,800 --> 02:17:31,400
Oh my god, who fucking...

2785
02:17:31,400 --> 02:17:32,300
Who told them?

2786
02:17:32,940 --> 02:17:34,200
Who told them who I was?

2787
02:17:37,960 --> 02:17:39,700
This is embarrassing.

2788
02:17:40,860 --> 02:17:42,940
We can't even be even!

2789
02:17:44,360 --> 02:17:46,960
We can't even be even!

2790
02:17:51,320 --> 02:17:52,760
Please come back.

2791
02:17:52,760 --> 02:17:54,700
Please come back.

2792
02:17:55,160 --> 02:17:56,400
Please.

2793
02:17:56,880 --> 02:17:58,420
Come back!

2794
02:17:58,640 --> 02:17:58,960
Please!

2795
02:18:02,360 --> 02:18:04,280
Please come back!

2796
02:18:06,520 --> 02:18:08,060
Please clock!

2797
02:18:09,160 --> 02:18:14,580
How did they do that?

2798
02:18:17,220 --> 02:18:19,940
Please come back, I'm sorry.

2799
02:18:19,940 --> 02:18:22,280
I'm so sorry.

2800
02:18:22,880 --> 02:18:27,280
I'll donate to the Mutant Cause after.

2801
02:18:28,160 --> 02:18:28,660
Please.

2802
02:18:29,720 --> 02:18:30,420
Please.

2803
02:18:31,180 --> 02:18:33,100
Where did they go?

2804
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,160
Guys, I don't think I can do this.

2805
02:18:37,040 --> 02:18:38,180
I don't think so.

2806
02:18:38,440 --> 02:18:40,660
We have a guy that swapped Black Panther.

2807
02:18:42,820 --> 02:18:44,400
Because like, I don't...

2808
02:18:44,400 --> 02:18:45,600
I think he gave up.

2809
02:18:47,460 --> 02:18:48,920
That's so unlucky.

2810
02:18:49,060 --> 02:18:50,180
This was so winnable.

2811
02:18:50,560 --> 02:18:51,940
If we had two healies.

2812
02:18:52,820 --> 02:18:54,140
Why on my team?

2813
02:18:54,460 --> 02:18:59,180
Why couldn't this Cloak and Dagger be on the enemy team so I could have farm?

2814
02:19:00,040 --> 02:19:00,940
Oh my god.

2815
02:19:01,100 --> 02:19:02,040
Is Cloak and Dagger immune?

2816
02:19:02,440 --> 02:19:04,020
Is Cloak and Dagger immune?

2817
02:19:04,440 --> 02:19:05,300
Is she immune?

2818
02:19:06,040 --> 02:19:07,520
Is my hate justified?

2819
02:19:12,820 --> 02:19:13,860
Of course.

2820
02:19:17,620 --> 02:19:18,700
She's not.

2821
02:19:19,120 --> 02:19:20,100
Oh my god.

2822
02:19:20,220 --> 02:19:21,660
Not even a Mutant?

2823
02:19:21,860 --> 02:19:22,920
Oh my god.

2824
02:19:24,380 --> 02:19:25,840
I'm gonna avoid this person.

2825
02:19:26,900 --> 02:19:28,380
I'm gonna avoid them.

2826
02:19:36,350 --> 02:19:39,670
I'm gonna I'm gonna avoid this Persecute again.

2827
02:19:39,790 --> 02:19:40,750
He's fucking...

2828
02:19:40,750 --> 02:19:42,590
So much hate.

2829
02:19:46,150 --> 02:19:46,870
Alright.

2830
02:19:46,870 --> 02:19:50,010
You guys are somehow alive.

2831
02:19:50,610 --> 02:19:52,390
What happened?

2832
02:19:52,590 --> 02:19:54,530
Did your mom unplug your fucking internet?

2833
02:19:55,190 --> 02:19:56,870
What the fuck happened to you?

2834
02:19:59,950 --> 02:20:00,750
Bro!

2835
02:20:02,570 --> 02:20:06,230
Like, did your mom said it's 1am?

2836
02:20:10,800 --> 02:20:13,880
I can't unplug this internet.

2837
02:20:14,840 --> 02:20:16,040
Oh, and he's back!

2838
02:20:16,040 --> 02:20:18,360
And this fucker's back!

2839
02:20:21,940 --> 02:20:26,200
At least the car is right there.

2840
02:20:31,940 --> 02:20:34,440
How did you dodge it?

2841
02:20:34,600 --> 02:20:35,820
It took 3 minutes.

2842
02:20:35,820 --> 02:20:36,640
I'm here!

2843
02:20:38,660 --> 02:20:38,800
I'm here!

2844
02:20:38,880 --> 02:20:39,240
Lock in!

2845
02:20:40,580 --> 02:20:41,700
It took...

2846
02:20:45,440 --> 02:20:46,260
Magneto's on Kite!

2847
02:20:46,340 --> 02:20:47,040
Magneto's on Kite!

2848
02:20:53,160 --> 02:20:55,500
Please just kill that Magneto.

2849
02:21:00,770 --> 02:21:02,430
I got us this time.

2850
02:21:04,410 --> 02:21:05,250
Oh my god.

2851
02:21:05,930 --> 02:21:06,530
Magneto's 1!

2852
02:21:06,730 --> 02:21:07,350
Magneto's 1!

2853
02:21:13,170 --> 02:21:14,150
Oh my god.

2854
02:21:15,710 --> 02:21:16,930
Oh my god.

2855
02:21:17,290 --> 02:21:18,790
This truly is hell.

2856
02:21:19,490 --> 02:21:20,850
I think I'm in hell.

2857
02:21:22,010 --> 02:21:24,290
I need someone to stay on Kite so I can heal in the back.

2858
02:21:35,820 --> 02:21:36,220
Please.

2859
02:21:36,980 --> 02:21:37,520
Play on Kite.

2860
02:21:37,600 --> 02:21:38,200
Play on Kite if you can.

2861
02:21:41,420 --> 02:21:43,840
Okay, play on Kite!

2862
02:21:44,360 --> 02:21:47,420
Why does nobody understand the word KITE?!

2863
02:21:53,280 --> 02:21:55,340
He walked out of

2864
02:22:00,540 --> 02:22:06,820
the guy that DCs walks out of my all.

2865
02:22:09,300 --> 02:22:10,880
Run away.

2866
02:22:12,180 --> 02:22:14,080
It's the streamer family.

2867
02:22:14,080 --> 02:22:15,300
Oh my god.

2868
02:22:15,300 --> 02:22:16,140
Not anymore.

2869
02:22:16,860 --> 02:22:18,900
Justice at last.

2870
02:22:19,100 --> 02:22:19,680
Okay.

2871
02:22:20,320 --> 02:22:20,940
Alright.

2872
02:22:22,740 --> 02:22:23,360
Alright.

2873
02:22:23,980 --> 02:22:25,040
I can't.

2874
02:22:25,080 --> 02:22:26,340
I can't deal with this guy.

2875
02:22:26,860 --> 02:22:27,220
I can't.

2876
02:22:27,360 --> 02:22:27,840
How do you 20?

2877
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:29,020
There's no way.

2878
02:22:29,560 --> 02:22:30,280
Wait a minute.

2879
02:22:30,400 --> 02:22:31,060
How do you 20?

2880
02:22:31,380 --> 02:22:31,960
Okay.

2881
02:22:33,600 --> 02:22:34,220
Alright.

2882
02:22:34,540 --> 02:22:35,340
That's fine.

2883
02:22:36,120 --> 02:22:36,540
Guys, no.

2884
02:22:36,580 --> 02:22:37,320
Don't say that.

2885
02:22:37,500 --> 02:22:39,160
Don't fucking say that.

2886
02:22:39,420 --> 02:22:39,860
Guys.

2887
02:22:52,180 --> 02:22:52,620
No.

2888
02:22:52,800 --> 02:22:52,840
No.

2889
02:22:52,840 --> 02:22:54,520
He has 21k healing.

2890
02:22:54,720 --> 02:22:56,300
That's why I'm like, how do you have that?

2891
02:22:56,440 --> 02:22:57,020
What happened?

2892
02:23:00,140 --> 02:23:01,480
Magneto was not right.

2893
02:23:01,700 --> 02:23:01,860
Guys.

2894
02:23:01,960 --> 02:23:03,860
He is a criminal.

2895
02:23:04,960 --> 02:23:06,380
Magneto is literally a criminal.

2896
02:23:06,800 --> 02:23:06,860
Guys.

2897
02:23:14,540 --> 02:23:16,420
But Jiro, thank you for them.

2898
02:23:17,220 --> 02:23:18,780
Thank you for the raid.

2899
02:23:18,880 --> 02:23:19,780
I really appreciate it.

2900
02:23:19,800 --> 02:23:20,060
Thank you.

2901
02:23:20,120 --> 02:23:20,860
Thank you.

2902
02:23:21,440 --> 02:23:24,100
Magneto is just...

2903
02:23:25,080 --> 02:23:26,820
I was just cloaking dagger.

2904
02:23:26,980 --> 02:23:27,540
It's alright.

2905
02:23:27,700 --> 02:23:28,260
I avoided you.

2906
02:23:28,720 --> 02:23:29,060
It's alright.

2907
02:23:34,960 --> 02:23:39,460
I'm sorry but I can't have these tears in my team.

2908
02:23:43,100 --> 02:23:44,720
But thank you for them.

2909
02:23:45,040 --> 02:23:45,560
Thank you for the raid.

2910
02:23:45,620 --> 02:23:47,360
For those who are new here, my name is DokiBird.

2911
02:23:47,480 --> 02:23:58,940
I usually stream on YouTube but like, I'm on Twitch right now because I guess I want to cry my rivals and I hate myself at the moment because we are... We're essentially at Doom queuing territory.

2912
02:23:59,680 --> 02:24:00,760
We've hit it.

2913
02:24:04,280 --> 02:24:04,800
Exactly.

2914
02:24:05,080 --> 02:24:09,020
This is a serious game and there's no DCing allowed in my team.

2915
02:24:17,270 --> 02:24:17,790
Damn.

2916
02:24:17,950 --> 02:24:18,590
That's fine.

2917
02:24:18,590 --> 02:24:20,550
We can have one tank.

2918
02:24:20,870 --> 02:24:21,650
That's alright.

2919
02:24:28,470 --> 02:24:30,150
Yeah, I took East Coast out.

2920
02:24:30,450 --> 02:24:31,930
That was the first thing I did.

2921
02:24:34,570 --> 02:24:35,030
Alright.

2922
02:24:40,560 --> 02:24:41,040
Alright.

2923
02:24:42,320 --> 02:24:43,220
That's fine.

2924
02:24:43,840 --> 02:24:44,080
What?

2925
02:24:44,500 --> 02:24:45,600
Okay, that's fine.

2926
02:24:48,600 --> 02:24:50,020
I don't like dual streaming.

2927
02:24:50,400 --> 02:24:51,460
No, I'm not a fan of it.

2928
02:24:51,500 --> 02:24:52,140
I don't like splitting.

2929
02:24:52,140 --> 02:24:57,880
I don't like splitting the chat because I have to read two different chats and I'm already too distracted with one chat.

2930
02:24:59,800 --> 02:25:00,260
Like...

2931
02:25:00,260 --> 02:25:01,900
Yeah, it's...

2932
02:25:01,900 --> 02:25:04,400
I'm already too distracted with one.

2933
02:25:06,100 --> 02:25:07,300
Alright, we take that three tanks.

2934
02:25:07,460 --> 02:25:07,740
You're right.

2935
02:25:07,860 --> 02:25:09,440
We have our little off tank right here.

2936
02:25:10,120 --> 02:25:12,720
This is such a dive heavy team.

2937
02:25:13,660 --> 02:25:14,800
It's going to be interesting.

2938
02:25:20,210 --> 02:25:21,730
I can't believe...

2939
02:25:21,730 --> 02:25:24,430
I can't believe we got the PC.

2940
02:25:25,090 --> 02:25:28,210
Like, how did it take three minutes to reconnect?

2941
02:25:29,770 --> 02:25:30,970
What's wrong?

2942
02:25:32,870 --> 02:25:34,030
What happened?

2943
02:25:35,410 --> 02:25:36,730
What the fuck happened?

2944
02:25:38,250 --> 02:25:41,030
I'm just waiting to see if we can adopt another tank player.

2945
02:25:41,730 --> 02:25:42,330
Honestly.

2946
02:25:46,050 --> 02:25:47,250
That's like...

2947
02:25:47,250 --> 02:25:50,610
I'm a little worried because I hear...

2948
02:25:51,120 --> 02:25:53,110
Oh, nevermind.

2949
02:25:53,270 --> 02:25:54,230
It focused on me.

2950
02:25:59,750 --> 02:26:00,450
Nevermind.

2951
02:26:00,930 --> 02:26:02,350
The focus was on...

2952
02:26:02,350 --> 02:26:05,590
Like, I got fucking...

2953
02:26:05,590 --> 02:26:08,890
I saw the Wolverine came back and I was like, whoa.

2954
02:26:10,490 --> 02:26:11,430
What the fuck?

2955
02:26:11,490 --> 02:26:11,930
Everyone's dead.

2956
02:26:19,270 --> 02:26:20,210
Here I go.

2957
02:26:21,050 --> 02:26:21,570
What?

2958
02:26:23,430 --> 02:26:25,470
I don't know.

2959
02:26:27,330 --> 02:26:29,490
What do you mean?

2960
02:26:29,730 --> 02:26:30,930
I got blew up.

2961
02:26:33,170 --> 02:26:34,690
Oh my god.

2962
02:26:35,250 --> 02:26:37,210
That's what happened to me right there.

2963
02:26:39,970 --> 02:26:41,630
What the fuck?

2964
02:26:43,190 --> 02:26:44,990
Use my ability.

2965
02:26:44,990 --> 02:26:45,410
What?

2966
02:26:48,030 --> 02:26:49,450
What do you mean?

2967
02:26:51,330 --> 02:26:52,950
That guy talks shit.

2968
02:26:53,050 --> 02:26:54,430
Hasn't happened to him.

2969
02:26:54,730 --> 02:26:55,410
Actually.

2970
02:26:56,010 --> 02:27:00,490
He talks shit and he got hit by it too.

2971
02:27:00,930 --> 02:27:02,390
Fuck off.

2972
02:27:06,210 --> 02:27:07,650
What happened to me?

2973
02:27:07,870 --> 02:27:08,610
I don't know.

2974
02:27:09,110 --> 02:27:09,950
You saw what happened?

2975
02:27:10,090 --> 02:27:12,110
Use your fucking abilities, I guess.

2976
02:27:14,990 --> 02:27:15,830
Well, time just won.

2977
02:27:17,330 --> 02:27:18,590
I'm teaming with that Mantis.

2978
02:27:21,670 --> 02:27:24,090
Actually, crazy thing to say to me.

2979
02:27:25,710 --> 02:27:27,150
Use your ability.

2980
02:27:30,070 --> 02:27:30,750
I don't play it.

2981
02:27:31,230 --> 02:27:32,030
I don't play it, play around me.

2982
02:27:38,650 --> 02:27:40,370
We're gonna have Strangel here.

2983
02:27:44,990 --> 02:27:45,770
Still can't.

2984
02:27:46,150 --> 02:27:47,470
Why is...

2985
02:27:48,910 --> 02:27:51,670
Guys, I have three people pushing me.

2986
02:27:57,920 --> 02:27:59,140
Oh my god.

2987
02:28:04,110 --> 02:28:07,150
There's a Magneto and Starlord on our Mantis.

2988
02:28:09,210 --> 02:28:10,470
Support needs help.

2989
02:28:17,930 --> 02:28:18,310
Alright.

2990
02:28:18,310 --> 02:28:18,870
Alright.

2991
02:28:20,570 --> 02:28:25,550
Actual fucking karma for that guy that said use your fucking abilities.

2992
02:28:26,030 --> 02:28:32,330
And then it happened to him again.

2993
02:28:32,850 --> 02:28:35,570
I'm just like, bro, you can't say that.

2994
02:28:36,350 --> 02:28:40,350
I'm literally like, what the fuck do you want me to do at that point?

2995
02:28:55,850 --> 02:28:56,370
Oh!

2996
02:28:56,570 --> 02:28:56,970
Oh, Magneto's half.

2997
02:28:57,870 --> 02:28:58,850
Magneto's low, Magneto's low.

2998
02:29:01,070 --> 02:29:05,430
Oh, it's Black Panther on me, Black Panther!

2999
02:29:06,070 --> 02:29:06,370
Oh!

3000
02:29:07,350 --> 02:29:09,030
Where did he go?

3001
02:29:15,780 --> 02:29:18,400
Magneto, I hear that and I fucking run.

3002
02:29:22,660 --> 02:29:23,460
And then...

3003
02:29:23,460 --> 02:29:25,220
Still, I'm still fucking, I'm mad.

3004
02:29:27,200 --> 02:29:29,000
You're using my C!

3005
02:29:29,740 --> 02:29:31,120
Oh shit, but you're right, I have a C.

3006
02:29:32,900 --> 02:29:34,420
You're right, no, this is my bad.

3007
02:29:35,180 --> 02:29:36,300
I didn't use my C.

3008
02:29:37,800 --> 02:29:40,260
I don't play with Iron Fist a lot, I forgot about my C.

3009
02:29:44,980 --> 02:29:45,740
I'm playing on point.

3010
02:29:51,950 --> 02:29:52,750
Oh my god.

3011
02:29:54,070 --> 02:29:55,190
Alright, C!

3012
02:29:57,490 --> 02:29:59,090
It doesn't matter.

3013
02:30:06,220 --> 02:30:07,760
Oh my god.

3014
02:30:11,780 --> 02:30:16,720
Alright, that was the one time he was right.

3015
02:30:16,840 --> 02:30:17,900
I forgot about the C.

3016
02:30:18,700 --> 02:30:19,800
The C didn't work though.

3017
02:30:20,280 --> 02:30:21,820
The C didn't work.

3018
02:30:23,020 --> 02:30:27,560
Guys, this guy's a Lord Panther.

3019
02:30:28,040 --> 02:30:29,460
Max not a Lord Panther.

3020
02:30:29,840 --> 02:30:30,880
What does he even do?

3021
02:30:31,060 --> 02:30:36,520
It like, makes it so that people don't dive as heavily.

3022
02:30:37,940 --> 02:30:41,740
If I get dived, I can see and I'll heal myself and push them away.

3023
02:30:43,860 --> 02:30:45,400
Yeah, it pushed people back.

3024
02:30:45,720 --> 02:30:47,360
I never had to use it until now.

3025
02:30:48,040 --> 02:30:48,460
That fight.

3026
02:30:48,780 --> 02:30:49,820
Or the last fight there.

3027
02:30:49,960 --> 02:30:51,820
The last fight where I got died by Black Panther.

3028
02:31:00,180 --> 02:31:01,920
Guys, I don't...

3029
02:31:01,920 --> 02:31:03,640
Guys, I think I'm gonna be GM-1 after this.

3030
02:31:06,880 --> 02:31:08,060
Yeah, because we don't...

3031
02:31:08,060 --> 02:31:09,740
Normally, you don't...

3032
02:31:09,740 --> 02:31:10,540
Guys, it's okay.

3033
02:31:10,600 --> 02:31:11,680
We can climb back up.

3034
02:31:11,840 --> 02:31:12,560
It's okay.

3035
02:31:12,780 --> 02:31:13,440
I believe.

3036
02:31:14,200 --> 02:31:15,440
I believe in the climb back.

3037
02:31:16,380 --> 02:31:17,340
And the C is gone now.

3038
02:31:17,380 --> 02:31:19,720
I got experience C for like one time.

3039
02:31:22,040 --> 02:31:23,940
Wait, why are you on Black Panther, Max?

3040
02:31:25,300 --> 02:31:26,000
Also, why...

3041
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:27,460
Why are we on Venom?

3042
02:31:29,080 --> 02:31:32,960
I don't know if we need Venom here.

3043
02:31:39,740 --> 02:31:40,020
What?

3044
02:31:41,740 --> 02:31:43,200
How does that not shield me?

3045
02:31:48,180 --> 02:31:49,260
Oh, Magno won.

3046
02:31:49,340 --> 02:31:49,820
Magno's won.

3047
02:31:57,560 --> 02:31:57,840
Alright.

3048
02:32:02,290 --> 02:32:04,470
Yeah, that's why I said I don't think we need...

3049
02:32:04,470 --> 02:32:05,330
Uh...

3050
02:32:05,330 --> 02:32:07,890
I don't think we needed, uh...

3051
02:32:08,530 --> 02:32:08,970
Venom.

3052
02:32:09,650 --> 02:32:10,990
Just cause like...

3053
02:32:10,990 --> 02:32:12,590
The only die we have is...

3054
02:32:12,590 --> 02:32:15,370
I mean, to be fair, we do have Wolverine and Black Panther.

3055
02:32:22,050 --> 02:32:22,930
Black Panther's won!

3056
02:32:26,350 --> 02:32:27,610
Oh my god.

3057
02:32:27,730 --> 02:32:27,970
No!

3058
02:32:30,770 --> 02:32:31,210
No!

3059
02:32:40,600 --> 02:32:42,100
Guys, I'm trapped!

3060
02:32:42,900 --> 02:32:43,660
Is it still winnable?

3061
02:32:44,020 --> 02:32:44,720
Oh, I'm fighting on point.

3062
02:32:48,080 --> 02:32:48,920
That's fine.

3063
02:32:49,800 --> 02:32:52,260
Okay, I guess I'll be the only one on point.

3064
02:32:52,560 --> 02:32:53,640
That's okay.

3065
02:32:54,600 --> 02:32:55,560
That's okay.

3066
02:32:55,760 --> 02:32:57,040
We're just gonna stall on point.

3067
02:32:58,220 --> 02:32:58,820
That's fine.

3068
02:32:58,900 --> 02:33:00,240
They wasted Star Lord ult.

3069
02:33:03,760 --> 02:33:04,760
We got it.

3070
02:33:05,320 --> 02:33:06,120
50%?

3071
02:33:06,260 --> 02:33:06,580
That's late.

3072
02:33:07,300 --> 02:33:09,600
Someone needs a snowball in the face.

3073
02:33:09,920 --> 02:33:11,480
Oh my god!

3074
02:33:12,140 --> 02:33:13,940
Wait, Mag, you go Star Lord?

3075
02:33:15,720 --> 02:33:18,780
Oh, okay.

3076
02:33:22,800 --> 02:33:23,340
What?!

3077
02:33:25,600 --> 02:33:27,380
I don't mean like that.

3078
02:33:27,520 --> 02:33:28,760
I mean like, people are gonna bitch.

3079
02:33:30,340 --> 02:33:31,480
Wait, Mag!

3080
02:33:31,700 --> 02:33:32,420
Come on!

3081
02:33:32,420 --> 02:33:32,560
Mag!

3082
02:33:33,060 --> 02:33:35,200
I can't have you!

3083
02:33:36,080 --> 02:33:36,520
Dude!

3084
02:33:38,160 --> 02:33:38,600
Mag!

3085
02:33:40,340 --> 02:33:41,220
Guys.

3086
02:33:42,300 --> 02:33:43,120
Guys, I can't.

3087
02:33:48,020 --> 02:33:49,200
Oh my god!

3088
02:33:49,220 --> 02:33:50,560
I can't have you explode!

3089
02:33:51,400 --> 02:33:54,260
Please, it's so winnable, Mag!

3090
02:33:54,520 --> 02:33:58,440
We can't have you fucking explode right now!

3091
02:34:04,380 --> 02:34:07,520
Mag is like slowing down.

3092
02:34:09,760 --> 02:34:10,960
Oh my god.

3093
02:34:11,360 --> 02:34:12,140
We're up three.

3094
02:34:20,100 --> 02:34:24,680
Mag, I can't have you fucking mental boom on me.

3095
02:34:24,960 --> 02:34:26,800
Mag, I can't.

3096
02:34:26,860 --> 02:34:30,260
Mag, I can't have you mental boom.

3097
02:34:31,140 --> 02:34:31,660
Please!

3098
02:34:34,540 --> 02:34:40,160
Oh my god.

3099
02:34:43,740 --> 02:34:45,080
This is very unfortunate.

3100
02:34:46,620 --> 02:34:48,040
This is very unfortunate.

3101
02:34:48,700 --> 02:34:50,540
What an unfortunate time we're in.

3102
02:34:52,180 --> 02:34:54,100
Help her over, help her over if you can.

3103
02:34:55,500 --> 02:34:56,420
I'm out, I'm out.

3104
02:34:56,980 --> 02:34:57,180
Okay.

3105
02:34:58,720 --> 02:34:59,840
I have to ult this.

3106
02:35:00,660 --> 02:35:01,680
Stay on me, stay on me, stay on me.

3107
02:35:03,260 --> 02:35:04,020
Just stay on me.

3108
02:35:11,890 --> 02:35:12,750
Black panther low.

3109
02:35:12,970 --> 02:35:13,850
I have a starlord on me.

3110
02:35:16,550 --> 02:35:17,170
Starlord low.

3111
02:35:22,650 --> 02:35:24,370
He has, he has, he has ult too.

3112
02:35:26,850 --> 02:35:27,210
Alright.

3113
02:35:27,210 --> 02:35:27,310
Alright.

3114
02:35:34,290 --> 02:35:37,470
I can't have him blowing up.

3115
02:35:44,680 --> 02:35:46,360
Music makes people happy.

3116
02:35:46,980 --> 02:35:48,060
Heroes make them safe.

3117
02:35:48,760 --> 02:35:50,060
Maybe I can do both.

3118
02:35:54,720 --> 02:35:55,880
Oh my god.

3119
02:36:00,360 --> 02:36:03,880
Drake was like, Drake was like, why don't I have snowflake?

3120
02:36:04,060 --> 02:36:06,480
And I was like, cause Mag's on panther.

3121
02:36:06,840 --> 02:36:08,460
And he's like, I don't care.

3122
02:36:08,460 --> 02:36:08,800
I-

3123
02:36:21,160 --> 02:36:24,680
Let him suffer.

3124
02:36:25,280 --> 02:36:25,820
Okay.

3125
02:36:26,460 --> 02:36:28,680
Alright, snowflakes on Drake.

3126
02:36:33,460 --> 02:36:34,760
Oh my god.

3127
02:36:36,600 --> 02:36:38,240
He's like, I can carry.

3128
02:36:38,440 --> 02:36:39,780
Give me the snowflake.

3129
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,500
Oh my god.

3130
02:36:42,620 --> 02:36:44,440
So warm in the stack.

3131
02:36:44,520 --> 02:36:45,880
My stack is blowing up.

3132
02:36:46,500 --> 02:36:48,760
My stack is...

3133
02:36:50,570 --> 02:36:52,850
My stack is blowing up.

3134
02:36:53,480 --> 02:36:54,160
Everybody.

3135
02:36:58,560 --> 02:37:00,460
There's a black panther on support.

3136
02:37:00,460 --> 02:37:02,660
It's okay, I killed that one.

3137
02:37:04,500 --> 02:37:05,700
There's a black panther.

3138
02:37:06,780 --> 02:37:08,460
It's okay, I killed their tank also.

3139
02:37:11,940 --> 02:37:12,640
Maybe it's not okay.

3140
02:37:13,060 --> 02:37:15,720
It's not okay that black panther killed us.

3141
02:37:17,740 --> 02:37:19,760
Oh man, I wanna do what black panther's doing.

3142
02:37:22,020 --> 02:37:23,060
It's okay.

3143
02:37:26,420 --> 02:37:28,420
I don't think Mace wants to play.

3144
02:37:30,460 --> 02:37:31,780
Black panther.

3145
02:37:35,860 --> 02:37:38,560
Oh no.

3146
02:37:43,200 --> 02:37:46,640
My favorite part where they're like, it's okay.

3147
02:37:46,920 --> 02:37:48,180
I have a starlord on me.

3148
02:37:48,500 --> 02:37:50,120
I might die.

3149
02:37:53,280 --> 02:37:55,460
It's not winnable.

3150
02:37:58,120 --> 02:38:00,460
The girls are fighting.

3151
02:38:00,460 --> 02:38:00,880
I can't do anything.

3152
02:38:04,160 --> 02:38:06,440
Does everyone just play for fun when they hit DM1?

3153
02:38:06,760 --> 02:38:07,380
What's up with that?

3154
02:38:09,680 --> 02:38:12,480
Bro, I'm like King Eternity, what do you mean?

3155
02:38:13,020 --> 02:38:14,520
I was Eternity.

3156
02:38:15,140 --> 02:38:16,700
I was Eternity.

3157
02:38:19,980 --> 02:38:21,900
After Eternity, Mace was like, peace.

3158
02:38:24,940 --> 02:38:26,460
I did my job.

3159
02:38:38,660 --> 02:38:39,260
Eternity.

3160
02:38:39,300 --> 02:38:42,440
Alright, I'm just gonna stay here.

3161
02:38:43,600 --> 02:38:45,680
I'm just gonna stay here.

3162
02:38:49,440 --> 02:38:50,400
My god.

3163
02:38:50,780 --> 02:38:52,140
Why do they get to have fun?

3164
02:38:52,740 --> 02:38:55,300
Why do the enemy team get to have...

3165
02:38:55,300 --> 02:38:57,920
Guys, I think Max's mental is actually...

3166
02:38:57,920 --> 02:38:59,720
I don't know what we can do to save his mental.

3167
02:39:00,300 --> 02:39:03,440
I actually don't know what to do.

3168
02:39:07,640 --> 02:39:10,840
My stack's fucking fighting too.

3169
02:39:21,700 --> 02:39:23,460
It's over.

3170
02:39:25,500 --> 02:39:27,040
Nice try, Horde!

3171
02:39:27,300 --> 02:39:28,520
Oh my god!

3172
02:39:35,400 --> 02:39:39,600
Zac is crashing out now.

3173
02:39:41,020 --> 02:39:41,640
Oh.

3174
02:39:42,520 --> 02:39:43,260
Oh.

3175
02:39:43,860 --> 02:39:49,360
That was... It was nice being Eternity for like half a day.

3176
02:39:50,640 --> 02:39:51,380
Bye.

3177
02:39:52,540 --> 02:39:54,400
Oh hey, I'm SPP though.

3178
02:39:56,120 --> 02:39:57,230
I'm SPP.

3179
02:40:02,200 --> 02:40:03,820
Oh shit, they've been muted.

3180
02:40:03,960 --> 02:40:04,440
Guys, see?

3181
02:40:04,500 --> 02:40:06,060
The reporting system works.

3182
02:40:06,680 --> 02:40:09,580
The reporting system works, guys.

3183
02:40:11,020 --> 02:40:11,620
I don't know.

3184
02:40:11,800 --> 02:40:13,360
What should we do, guys?

3185
02:40:14,620 --> 02:40:15,940
What do we do?

3186
02:40:16,020 --> 02:40:16,900
Do we keep going?

3187
02:40:17,960 --> 02:40:19,180
I feel like...

3188
02:40:19,180 --> 02:40:21,520
I feel like he's crashed out.

3189
02:40:22,140 --> 02:40:25,020
I feel like...

3190
02:40:44,750 --> 02:40:46,230
I don't know.

3191
02:40:47,630 --> 02:40:48,970
Break up the stack?

3192
02:40:49,110 --> 02:40:50,590
Do we break up the stack?

3193
02:40:50,590 --> 02:40:52,630
Eternity or nothing?

3194
02:40:52,930 --> 02:40:54,070
Do we try to get...

3195
02:40:59,310 --> 02:41:01,250
I'm sorry, boys.

3196
02:41:01,350 --> 02:41:03,690
I'm breaking up the stack.

3197
02:41:15,390 --> 02:41:18,030
We gotta break up.

3198
02:41:18,030 --> 02:41:20,230
I'm sorry, everybody.

3199
02:41:20,470 --> 02:41:22,010
I don't understand.

3200
02:41:26,610 --> 02:41:28,370
Oh my god.

3201
02:41:30,150 --> 02:41:31,510
Oh my god.

3202
02:41:32,310 --> 02:41:32,850
Alright.

3203
02:41:33,570 --> 02:41:35,950
Back to...

3204
02:41:35,950 --> 02:41:38,090
Stack is angry at each other.

3205
02:41:38,530 --> 02:41:40,710
Yeah, my stack is angry at each other.

3206
02:41:41,310 --> 02:41:44,090
They were not happy.

3207
02:41:50,010 --> 02:41:51,410
Okay, let's see.

3208
02:41:51,650 --> 02:41:52,230
I need to avoid...

3209
02:41:53,010 --> 02:41:53,570
Actually...

3210
02:41:53,570 --> 02:41:54,270
Oh no.

3211
02:41:55,010 --> 02:41:57,850
I don't think I need to avoid anybody, honestly.

3212
02:41:58,610 --> 02:41:59,490
It was just...

3213
02:41:59,490 --> 02:42:00,830
Oh my god, that actually hurts.

3214
02:42:01,070 --> 02:42:02,550
Oh my god, I was doing so well, too.

3215
02:42:02,950 --> 02:42:04,630
Things were going so well.

3216
02:42:05,110 --> 02:42:05,490
No.

3217
02:42:06,870 --> 02:42:09,110
They both wanted Snowflake.

3218
02:42:19,120 --> 02:42:19,680
Alright.

3219
02:42:20,720 --> 02:42:21,120
Alright.

3220
02:42:22,480 --> 02:42:22,860
Okay.

3221
02:42:22,860 --> 02:42:23,460
Alright.

3222
02:42:23,940 --> 02:42:27,520
Kendrick Lamar was like, give me one more chance.

3223
02:42:32,440 --> 02:42:35,320
But if we lose the next game...

3224
02:42:35,320 --> 02:42:38,600
If we lose the next game, it's solo time.

3225
02:42:42,940 --> 02:42:45,820
They were like, just give me the Snowflake.

3226
02:42:46,280 --> 02:42:47,160
Just, okay.

3227
02:42:47,880 --> 02:42:48,360
Alright.

3228
02:42:50,920 --> 02:42:52,300
Alright, we'll see.

3229
02:42:52,300 --> 02:42:55,200
They were like, give me the Snowflake, and it'll be fine.

3230
02:42:55,740 --> 02:42:57,120
We'll see how it goes.

3231
02:42:58,020 --> 02:43:00,240
Maybe it will be fine, who knows.

3232
02:43:00,660 --> 02:43:01,960
Who knows.

3233
02:43:04,440 --> 02:43:05,960
East Coast is...

3234
02:43:05,960 --> 02:43:08,760
Did you remove...

3235
02:43:08,760 --> 02:43:10,060
East Coast?

3236
02:43:13,480 --> 02:43:15,180
We just gotta...

3237
02:43:15,820 --> 02:43:19,520
We just gotta like, find a tank player and adopt them.

3238
02:43:19,580 --> 02:43:24,460
Okay, if we get a really good tank player on our team, I'm gonna be like, join.

3239
02:43:29,400 --> 02:43:31,900
If we find a...

3240
02:43:31,900 --> 02:43:34,720
Okay guys, we're gonna fucking adopt a tank player.

3241
02:43:35,520 --> 02:43:37,660
We could find a tank player, I believe.

3242
02:43:39,460 --> 02:43:40,420
I believe.

3243
02:43:40,560 --> 02:43:42,560
No, the issue with this always...

3244
02:43:42,560 --> 02:43:52,080
I think the issue is always like, if you trio stack with two DPS players, there's always gonna be inter-fighting with the DPS players.

3245
02:43:52,240 --> 02:43:52,880
I've noticed.

3246
02:43:53,520 --> 02:43:56,400
I need to find a tank player to adopt.

3247
02:43:56,740 --> 02:43:58,040
Tank is so important.

3248
02:43:59,300 --> 02:44:03,020
It's like, literally the game changer.

3249
02:44:03,900 --> 02:44:06,600
If we can just like...

3250
02:44:15,300 --> 02:44:17,140
Are we Q-dodging?

3251
02:44:18,060 --> 02:44:19,540
What are we doing?

3252
02:44:19,760 --> 02:44:20,540
Are we...

3253
02:44:20,540 --> 02:44:21,780
Q-dodging?

3254
02:44:23,800 --> 02:44:25,380
Oh, we are.

3255
02:44:30,450 --> 02:44:34,810
No, Max Doom infected me.

3256
02:44:35,690 --> 02:44:40,010
His like, fucked up lobbies infected my fucked up lobbies.

3257
02:44:40,490 --> 02:44:41,830
So things got...

3258
02:44:41,830 --> 02:44:43,810
Things got intense.

3259
02:44:44,350 --> 02:44:46,130
Things got...

3260
02:44:46,130 --> 02:44:47,990
Mays hit rank one last night?

3261
02:44:48,210 --> 02:44:49,570
No, he didn't.

3262
02:44:52,480 --> 02:44:53,920
He lost it.

3263
02:44:57,750 --> 02:44:59,370
I don't know if he's trying to get it back.

3264
02:45:01,910 --> 02:45:03,870
He's rank number two now.

3265
02:45:05,250 --> 02:45:06,190
Don't worry.

3266
02:45:08,110 --> 02:45:08,870
Don't worry.

3267
02:45:09,810 --> 02:45:11,230
We'll be able to adopt a tank.

3268
02:45:11,390 --> 02:45:12,170
It's possible.

3269
02:45:12,770 --> 02:45:15,670
A miracle's gonna happen at four in the morning.

3270
02:45:16,410 --> 02:45:17,490
I believe it.

3271
02:45:17,490 --> 02:45:21,690
I believe we will have a miracle at four in the morning.

3272
02:45:22,590 --> 02:45:24,230
There's always hope.

3273
02:45:29,520 --> 02:45:32,660
Oh my god, now we're in the GM one lobbies.

3274
02:45:33,060 --> 02:45:37,640
Oh my god, I'm back in the slums.

3275
02:45:37,780 --> 02:45:38,680
Hello everybody.

3276
02:45:39,600 --> 02:45:40,820
I'm back in the...

3277
02:45:40,820 --> 02:45:42,960
I once saw what it was like up there.

3278
02:45:45,440 --> 02:45:47,180
I'm back in the slums.

3279
02:45:47,880 --> 02:45:50,340
I saw what it was like back up there.

3280
02:45:50,700 --> 02:45:52,540
It was beautiful.

3281
02:45:53,360 --> 02:45:55,720
Those eternity games felt like heaven.

3282
02:45:56,020 --> 02:45:58,240
It was so beautiful and then I got kicked out.

3283
02:45:58,860 --> 02:46:01,920
I got kicked out of heaven and now I'm here.

3284
02:46:02,220 --> 02:46:05,280
Now I'm here.

3285
02:46:06,700 --> 02:46:09,200
Back into the clown lobbies.

3286
02:46:16,060 --> 02:46:19,240
We don't have a tank player?

3287
02:46:21,200 --> 02:46:21,490
Better?

3288
02:46:24,200 --> 02:46:25,680
A better Hawkeye?

3289
02:46:25,960 --> 02:46:27,980
I only play spider.

3290
02:46:28,320 --> 02:46:29,340
Fucking hell.

3291
02:46:32,740 --> 02:46:33,700
It's okay.

3292
02:46:36,180 --> 02:46:37,040
Wait, who said that?

3293
02:46:37,700 --> 02:46:40,260
Well, you'll get Hawke or we do.

3294
02:46:42,120 --> 02:46:42,860
We got...

3295
02:46:42,860 --> 02:46:43,560
Oh, fuck it.

3296
02:46:43,740 --> 02:46:44,640
Let's just ban Bounty.

3297
02:46:44,660 --> 02:46:45,140
Fuck it.

3298
02:46:45,220 --> 02:46:46,640
Somebody on my team can play Helga.

3299
02:46:47,200 --> 02:46:47,920
Okay, nice.

3300
02:46:49,300 --> 02:46:49,860
Alright.

3301
02:46:50,680 --> 02:46:53,100
We literally just need one tank player.

3302
02:46:53,440 --> 02:46:53,700
Nice.

3303
02:46:53,820 --> 02:46:55,160
We have our one tank player.

3304
02:46:57,420 --> 02:46:57,980
That's...

3305
02:47:00,740 --> 02:47:01,620
That's fine.

3306
02:47:01,800 --> 02:47:02,960
Everything will be okay.

3307
02:47:04,020 --> 02:47:08,140
We might be back in the slums, but like surely we won't be there forever.

3308
02:47:08,760 --> 02:47:09,520
Right, guys?

3309
02:47:10,420 --> 02:47:10,980
Surely.

3310
02:47:12,060 --> 02:47:16,100
Alright, we don't end until we get eternity... Okay, I'm changing my title again.

3311
02:47:16,100 --> 02:47:18,580
Not ending until eternity.

3312
02:47:19,980 --> 02:47:22,100
Back at it again.

3313
02:47:22,120 --> 02:47:25,440
Instead of top 500.

3314
02:47:26,100 --> 02:47:27,380
Maybe top 500.

3315
02:47:27,740 --> 02:47:28,240
It's not.

3316
02:47:28,660 --> 02:47:30,300
It's like deja vu.

3317
02:47:31,970 --> 02:47:33,080
Not again.

3318
02:47:34,020 --> 02:47:35,380
Not again.

3319
02:47:36,740 --> 02:47:40,740
Not ending until eternity again.

3320
02:47:46,280 --> 02:47:48,320
We're back, guys.

3321
02:47:49,120 --> 02:47:53,060
Oh my God, it's just like last time.

3322
02:47:55,440 --> 02:47:56,040
Guys.

3323
02:47:57,460 --> 02:47:57,900
Alright.

3324
02:47:58,180 --> 02:48:00,320
Now he can't complain about the snowflakes.

3325
02:48:01,520 --> 02:48:02,360
And we're like...

3326
02:48:02,360 --> 02:48:02,700
I don't know.

3327
02:48:02,780 --> 02:48:03,740
I think this was on stream.

3328
02:48:04,440 --> 02:48:05,480
We're like...

3329
02:48:05,480 --> 02:48:07,880
They're like, I need a snowflake.

3330
02:48:08,560 --> 02:48:09,140
The tank.

3331
02:48:10,480 --> 02:48:12,280
And they're like...

3332
02:48:12,280 --> 02:48:12,860
Who cares?

3333
02:48:14,540 --> 02:48:16,140
DPS players, am I right?

3334
02:48:18,700 --> 02:48:21,120
Wait, now we have two tank players?

3335
02:48:21,460 --> 02:48:26,620
Oh my God, I've never seen two tank players in my...

3336
02:48:26,620 --> 02:48:28,800
In all these streams we've been playing.

3337
02:48:31,540 --> 02:48:32,520
This is rare.

3338
02:48:33,300 --> 02:48:33,580
Alright.

3339
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:36,860
We need to adopt a tank, though.

3340
02:48:38,140 --> 02:48:39,220
Avoid Spider-Man?

3341
02:48:39,340 --> 02:48:40,660
I mean, Spider-Man and this heal though.

3342
02:48:40,660 --> 02:48:42,220
They're like...

3343
02:48:42,220 --> 02:48:43,820
I mean, he's doing really well.

3344
02:48:44,080 --> 02:48:44,980
Not gonna lie.

3345
02:48:45,440 --> 02:48:45,580
Oh,

3346
02:48:48,940 --> 02:48:49,380
I need heals.

3347
02:48:54,240 --> 02:48:55,280
Oh my God.

3348
02:48:56,920 --> 02:48:58,360
Goodbye, Spider-Man.

3349
02:48:59,240 --> 02:48:59,820
Goodbye.

3350
02:49:02,800 --> 02:49:03,460
They're walled up again.

3351
02:49:08,870 --> 02:49:09,950
This is fine.

3352
02:49:09,950 --> 02:49:10,130
This is fine.

3353
02:49:10,950 --> 02:49:12,650
This is so fine.

3354
02:49:13,970 --> 02:49:14,590
Oh!

3355
02:49:15,710 --> 02:49:16,330
Shit.

3356
02:49:18,850 --> 02:49:19,510
Oh, group behind us!

3357
02:49:19,550 --> 02:49:20,010
Group behind us!

3358
02:49:21,030 --> 02:49:22,250
Mantis ult first, if you want.

3359
02:49:26,010 --> 02:49:27,490
There's more behind us.

3360
02:49:29,650 --> 02:49:30,510
Where's our...

3361
02:49:30,510 --> 02:49:31,490
Mantis ult?

3362
02:49:32,590 --> 02:49:34,130
Where's our Mantis ult?

3363
02:49:35,710 --> 02:49:37,090
Where was it?

3364
02:49:37,090 --> 02:49:38,350
Where was it?

3365
02:49:41,760 --> 02:49:44,560
Wait, the low-key one-trick is on Magneto?

3366
02:49:46,900 --> 02:49:48,100
What happened?

3367
02:49:52,520 --> 02:49:53,920
What happened?

3368
02:49:54,460 --> 02:49:55,380
I can't see you.

3369
02:49:55,800 --> 02:49:55,840
Strange.

3370
02:49:59,480 --> 02:50:01,640
We gotta pick.

3371
02:50:01,860 --> 02:50:02,820
We're up one.

3372
02:50:04,340 --> 02:50:05,080
Magneto half.

3373
02:50:09,500 --> 02:50:10,600
We're up two.

3374
02:50:11,260 --> 02:50:12,980
Left side no more.

3375
02:50:22,200 --> 02:50:23,900
That's a huge ult.

3376
02:50:30,120 --> 02:50:32,000
They have Groot ult.

3377
02:50:34,180 --> 02:50:35,520
There it is.

3378
02:50:35,920 --> 02:50:36,980
There's the Groot ult.

3379
02:50:37,080 --> 02:50:37,900
There it is.

3380
02:50:38,220 --> 02:50:39,840
There it is.

3381
02:50:42,440 --> 02:50:42,980
I'm on one.

3382
02:50:43,080 --> 02:50:43,320
I'm on one.

3383
02:50:50,440 --> 02:50:51,280
That's fine.

3384
02:50:52,560 --> 02:50:53,740
That's so fine.

3385
02:50:54,220 --> 02:50:55,740
Not a one-trick anymore.

3386
02:50:55,920 --> 02:50:58,260
That's when you know the Q's been very doomed.

3387
02:51:00,120 --> 02:51:00,680
That's...

3388
02:51:03,800 --> 02:51:04,680
Jeff is low.

3389
02:51:04,740 --> 02:51:05,100
Jeff is low.

3390
02:51:06,660 --> 02:51:07,220
No!

3391
02:51:11,690 --> 02:51:12,650
Can you reload?

3392
02:51:15,150 --> 02:51:15,990
I'm stuck on a tree.

3393
02:51:16,310 --> 02:51:17,270
I might be dead.

3394
02:51:17,370 --> 02:51:17,870
I have 5 HP.

3395
02:51:21,310 --> 02:51:23,210
I'm stuck on a tree.

3396
02:51:24,150 --> 02:51:25,190
A tree.

3397
02:51:27,310 --> 02:51:28,250
Oh yeah, what happened?

3398
02:51:28,450 --> 02:51:29,650
I'm Spiderman only.

3399
02:51:30,490 --> 02:51:31,470
What happened?

3400
02:51:34,350 --> 02:51:35,270
Oh my god.

3401
02:51:36,370 --> 02:51:37,390
What a character.

3402
02:51:37,390 --> 02:51:37,790
There's...

3403
02:51:38,790 --> 02:51:40,070
There's walled off tanks.

3404
02:51:42,510 --> 02:51:44,310
There's someone behind us.

3405
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:04,300
I don't have ult for Groot ult.

3406
02:52:04,460 --> 02:52:05,200
Or Psylocke ult.

3407
02:52:05,620 --> 02:52:06,360
I'm 85 though.

3408
02:52:06,420 --> 02:52:07,340
You can farm for me.

3409
02:52:07,340 --> 02:52:09,260
Yeah, you might get it faster.

3410
02:52:10,860 --> 02:52:13,340
Yeah, he has to take damage so I can...

3411
02:52:15,040 --> 02:52:15,520
I'm 90.

3412
02:52:17,060 --> 02:52:17,720
I got it.

3413
02:52:17,760 --> 02:52:17,960
I got it.

3414
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:18,240
I got it.

3415
02:52:18,260 --> 02:52:18,740
I got it.

3416
02:52:19,440 --> 02:52:21,000
Oh, please!

3417
02:52:22,080 --> 02:52:22,880
It's kind of fat.

3418
02:52:27,750 --> 02:52:28,610
I'm Jeffed.

3419
02:52:28,630 --> 02:52:30,190
I got Jeffed.

3420
02:52:31,310 --> 02:52:31,450
Nice.

3421
02:52:36,970 --> 02:52:37,930
I got it.

3422
02:52:38,110 --> 02:52:38,210
I got it.

3423
02:52:38,210 --> 02:52:38,830
Walled tank.

3424
02:52:40,630 --> 02:52:40,990
Alright,

3425
02:52:55,920 --> 02:52:57,620
next time we'll do Mantis ult first.

3426
02:52:57,720 --> 02:52:58,300
Yeah, my bad.

3427
02:52:58,440 --> 02:52:59,560
I thought you used it already.

3428
02:53:03,980 --> 02:53:04,320
I'm not gonna die.

3429
02:53:04,380 --> 02:53:04,660
I'm not gonna die.

3430
02:53:08,360 --> 02:53:09,480
Oh my god.

3431
02:53:10,020 --> 02:53:10,740
That's fine.

3432
02:53:14,700 --> 02:53:16,960
Everything is fine!

3433
02:53:19,140 --> 02:53:19,540
Everything is fine!

3434
02:53:19,540 --> 02:53:19,840
Oh, get Groot.

3435
02:53:19,980 --> 02:53:20,080
Get Groot.

3436
02:53:20,200 --> 02:53:20,360
Get Groot.

3437
02:53:20,620 --> 02:53:21,740
Yeah, nice.

3438
02:53:22,700 --> 02:53:24,740
Everything is so gay!

3439
02:53:24,820 --> 02:53:26,020
I'm dancing!

3440
02:53:28,440 --> 02:53:29,240
Yippee!

3441
02:53:38,200 --> 02:53:39,860
You're so healthy!

3442
02:53:41,680 --> 02:53:43,260
Oh, he's not.

3443
02:53:43,260 --> 02:53:44,160
He's a bitch.

3444
02:53:44,480 --> 02:53:45,900
He's not healthy.

3445
02:53:52,460 --> 02:53:54,140
I froze Magneto.

3446
02:53:55,280 --> 02:53:56,360
I'm ulting this.

3447
02:53:56,720 --> 02:53:57,300
Play him out.

3448
02:53:57,380 --> 02:53:57,940
Play him out.

3449
02:53:58,280 --> 02:54:02,780
I like Mantis.

3450
02:54:03,960 --> 02:54:06,720
Magneto will have...

3451
02:54:07,240 --> 02:54:07,940
That's a huge crit ult.

3452
02:54:07,980 --> 02:54:08,500
Huge crit ult.

3453
02:54:10,700 --> 02:54:11,980
Oh, good fight.

3454
02:54:11,980 --> 02:54:13,520
Get Groot.

3455
02:54:14,760 --> 02:54:16,940
There's a Magneto on supports.

3456
02:54:19,800 --> 02:54:20,460
Magneto low.

3457
02:54:21,560 --> 02:54:22,200
Nice, nice, nice.

3458
02:54:23,060 --> 02:54:23,520
I'm on Groot.

3459
02:54:24,640 --> 02:54:26,660
Oh, there is an Amour behind us.

3460
02:54:29,920 --> 02:54:31,080
Amour is still behind.

3461
02:54:34,460 --> 02:54:35,440
Oh, no.

3462
02:54:36,160 --> 02:54:37,180
Hey, Luna ulted though.

3463
02:54:37,180 --> 02:54:39,020
We have to keep fighting until we have a winner.

3464
02:54:40,220 --> 02:54:41,040
We can contest with my ult.

3465
02:54:41,260 --> 02:54:41,880
Hold on, I'm coming back.

3466
02:54:43,080 --> 02:54:44,720
There's still a chance to stop them.

3467
02:54:46,920 --> 02:54:48,640
I don't know what happened there.

3468
02:54:49,180 --> 02:54:50,560
But like, I got...

3469
02:54:51,060 --> 02:54:52,260
It's a little scary.

3470
02:54:54,880 --> 02:54:55,620
Nice, we're even.

3471
02:54:56,900 --> 02:54:57,740
Psylocke is half.

3472
02:54:57,820 --> 02:54:58,260
Psylocke is half.

3473
02:54:58,340 --> 02:54:58,700
He has ult.

3474
02:55:00,560 --> 02:55:01,000
I got Psylocke.

3475
02:55:01,500 --> 02:55:01,860
It's just Groot.

3476
02:55:02,960 --> 02:55:03,600
Okay, it's Groot.

3477
02:55:03,820 --> 02:55:04,100
Groot, Groot, Groot.

3478
02:55:04,100 --> 02:55:04,800
Groot won, Groot won.

3479
02:55:05,040 --> 02:55:05,280
Luna?

3480
02:55:06,400 --> 02:55:07,340
Luna is frozen.

3481
02:55:07,940 --> 02:55:09,620
Nice, nice.

3482
02:55:09,940 --> 02:55:11,720
There's too much yellow and it's 4 AM.

3483
02:55:15,160 --> 02:55:17,240
There's too much yellow.

3484
02:55:20,660 --> 02:55:21,300
Okay.

3485
02:55:26,620 --> 02:55:28,940
You guys see what he said?

3486
02:55:28,940 --> 02:55:29,760
Yeah.

3487
02:55:29,760 --> 02:55:33,320
Yeah, why am I...

3488
02:55:33,320 --> 02:55:35,380
Guys, it's 4 AM.

3489
02:55:35,540 --> 02:55:36,680
Why are you yelling?

3490
02:55:36,840 --> 02:55:37,880
Why am I yelling?

3491
02:55:38,320 --> 02:55:40,220
Guys, it's not even 4, it's 1.30!

3492
02:55:41,040 --> 02:55:42,560
It's 1.30.

3493
02:55:42,720 --> 02:55:44,700
The night is still young.

3494
02:55:46,760 --> 02:55:50,320
What is an EZ doing in my queues?

3495
02:55:50,760 --> 02:55:58,620
What is he doing in my queues?

3496
02:55:58,940 --> 02:55:59,960
What is EZ doing?

3497
02:56:01,380 --> 02:56:03,220
I thought I cut you out.

3498
02:56:09,800 --> 02:56:11,000
It's fine.

3499
02:56:11,860 --> 02:56:13,000
It's fine.

3500
02:56:14,280 --> 02:56:15,840
The day is young, exactly.

3501
02:56:16,080 --> 02:56:18,080
We're back to the...

3502
02:56:18,080 --> 02:56:20,420
Not stopping until eternity.

3503
02:56:23,800 --> 02:56:25,580
It's like we never left.

3504
02:56:26,800 --> 02:56:29,280
It's like a little...

3505
02:56:29,280 --> 02:56:30,860
A little bit of...

3506
02:56:30,860 --> 02:56:35,720
Guys, are you okay if I just stream Marvel Rivals until I get top 500?

3507
02:56:35,980 --> 02:56:36,640
Are you guys...

3508
02:56:36,640 --> 02:56:37,540
I'm sorry.

3509
02:56:37,640 --> 02:56:40,240
I know you guys want a regular life again.

3510
02:56:40,320 --> 02:56:41,200
I'm so sorry.

3511
02:56:41,680 --> 02:56:42,160
I...

3512
02:56:44,280 --> 02:56:45,400
I'm sorry.

3513
02:56:45,560 --> 02:56:47,960
I'm worried that I lose people.

3514
02:56:49,260 --> 02:56:49,920
Because...

3515
02:56:49,920 --> 02:56:51,000
I...

3516
02:56:52,460 --> 02:56:53,780
Everybody just...

3517
02:56:53,780 --> 02:56:55,780
All my fans disappear.

3518
02:57:00,160 --> 02:57:01,820
Guys, it's just six...

3519
02:57:01,820 --> 02:57:04,000
Guys, if I could finish it early...

3520
02:57:04,760 --> 02:57:06,620
Then it could technically be three days.

3521
02:57:08,020 --> 02:57:09,880
Guys, I could...

3522
02:57:09,880 --> 02:57:11,320
It could become three days.

3523
02:57:11,400 --> 02:57:14,500
If we get the best games of our lives.

3524
02:57:14,860 --> 02:57:15,900
We just need to be like...

3525
02:57:15,900 --> 02:57:17,460
We literally need to have secure.

3526
02:57:17,980 --> 02:57:19,620
We need to be like 200 points.

3527
02:57:20,260 --> 02:57:21,320
That's all we need.

3528
02:57:21,320 --> 02:57:22,880
That's all we need.

3529
02:57:23,020 --> 02:57:24,080
200 points.

3530
02:57:24,680 --> 02:57:26,100
Just 200 points.

3531
02:57:26,420 --> 02:57:28,480
Surely we can get 200 points.

3532
02:57:28,840 --> 02:57:29,660
You guys are so far.

3533
02:57:29,700 --> 02:57:30,360
I don't know if I can.

3534
02:57:34,690 --> 02:57:36,270
There's a Psylocke above us.

3535
02:57:40,010 --> 02:57:41,590
I think... Goodbye.

3536
02:57:45,150 --> 02:57:46,050
Wait, that's huge.

3537
02:57:48,690 --> 02:57:49,410
Magnio's one.

3538
02:57:52,690 --> 02:57:53,150
Let's go.

3539
02:57:54,370 --> 02:57:55,890
Hey, let's go.

3540
02:57:58,610 --> 02:58:00,630
I'm sorry, everybody.

3541
02:58:00,810 --> 02:58:03,250
I know you guys want regular streams again.

3542
02:58:03,330 --> 02:58:04,270
I'm so sorry.

3543
02:58:08,970 --> 02:58:10,330
I'm sorry.

3544
02:58:10,490 --> 02:58:12,010
I'm killing my career.

3545
02:58:12,130 --> 02:58:13,750
I'm just playing Minecraft.

3546
02:58:15,030 --> 02:58:16,570
Oh my god.

3547
02:58:16,650 --> 02:58:18,850
I can't stop.

3548
02:58:18,850 --> 02:58:18,990
I can't stop.

3549
02:58:20,690 --> 02:58:24,990
Starting off strong in 2025 with career sabotage.

3550
02:58:29,190 --> 02:58:33,850
Starting it off strong by sabotaging my career.

3551
02:58:37,650 --> 02:58:41,190
I'm moving up a little bit.

3552
02:58:43,230 --> 02:58:43,510
Wait, wait.

3553
02:58:43,610 --> 02:58:43,970
Strange is low.

3554
02:58:44,390 --> 02:58:45,710
Strange has ult too.

3555
02:58:48,850 --> 02:58:52,450
This is a regular stream.

3556
02:58:52,750 --> 02:58:54,910
Psylocke, Psylocke on me.

3557
02:58:58,690 --> 02:59:02,130
There's a Psylocke behind Magnio's.

3558
02:59:03,890 --> 02:59:04,550
Yay!

3559
02:59:05,590 --> 02:59:06,610
No one's got me.

3560
02:59:06,750 --> 02:59:08,910
I know Rivals got me.

3561
02:59:12,650 --> 02:59:14,170
How'd I lose you, man?

3562
02:59:14,370 --> 02:59:18,110
I could do a regular stream like...

3563
02:59:18,110 --> 02:59:19,670
It ends next week, guys.

3564
02:59:20,090 --> 02:59:22,310
It ends next week, guys.

3565
02:59:22,610 --> 02:59:26,330
Literally, just please wait for me for one more week, guys.

3566
02:59:27,810 --> 02:59:28,410
Please.

3567
02:59:29,110 --> 02:59:33,290
Guys, just wait for me for one more week, guys.

3568
02:59:38,770 --> 02:59:39,970
And then...

3569
02:59:39,970 --> 02:59:41,290
And then it'll be okay.

3570
02:59:41,750 --> 02:59:42,470
I'm sorry.

3571
02:59:42,610 --> 02:59:43,090
I'm sorry.

3572
02:59:43,130 --> 02:59:47,690
I'm killing my career with this Marvel Rivals brain rot in the beginning of the year.

3573
02:59:47,690 --> 02:59:50,990
But guys, please just stay strong.

3574
02:59:51,350 --> 02:59:52,550
Stay strong.

3575
02:59:52,750 --> 02:59:53,750
I don't like...

3576
02:59:53,750 --> 02:59:54,370
Please.

3577
02:59:54,610 --> 02:59:57,090
My career can't end in 2025.

3578
02:59:57,970 --> 03:00:00,130
My career...

3579
03:00:00,130 --> 03:00:02,630
I want more Marvel Rivals.

3580
03:00:05,610 --> 03:00:07,970
The strongest fanbase.

3581
03:00:09,950 --> 03:00:13,670
I'll even stream Rivals at decent hours too.

3582
03:00:13,810 --> 03:00:15,270
I'll even... I'll do it.

3583
03:00:15,270 --> 03:00:17,270
I swear to god, I'll do it.

3584
03:00:19,250 --> 03:00:21,630
You need Marvel... Jesus.

3585
03:00:27,610 --> 03:00:29,170
IE Baby, what a name.

3586
03:00:29,670 --> 03:00:30,610
Thank you for the Twitch prom.

3587
03:00:30,730 --> 03:00:31,290
Thank you, thank you.

3588
03:00:31,350 --> 03:00:32,690
Lewis, thank you for the tier 1 sub.

3589
03:00:32,770 --> 03:00:33,370
Thank you, thank you.

3590
03:00:33,630 --> 03:00:35,510
Hat and Gloves, thank you for the $10 donation.

3591
03:00:35,710 --> 03:00:36,250
Thank you, thank you.

3592
03:00:39,950 --> 03:00:41,570
Marvel Rivals streams are peak content.

3593
03:00:41,710 --> 03:00:42,010
Keep at it.

3594
03:00:42,010 --> 03:00:42,910
We love watching those.

3595
03:00:42,910 --> 03:00:44,990
Yeah, but they're like, you know...

3596
03:00:44,990 --> 03:00:48,930
I even said like, guys, you shouldn't stream only one thing all the time.

3597
03:00:49,070 --> 03:00:49,790
And then there's me.

3598
03:01:00,890 --> 03:01:02,490
Just six more days.

3599
03:01:03,030 --> 03:01:05,150
It's just six more days, everybody.

3600
03:01:05,490 --> 03:01:07,890
We can be strong for six more days.

3601
03:01:11,250 --> 03:01:12,010
Please.

3602
03:01:12,050 --> 03:01:12,810
Please.

3603
03:01:12,950 --> 03:01:15,210
Please give me six more days and then we'll be there.

3604
03:01:16,050 --> 03:01:16,930
I believe.

3605
03:01:21,430 --> 03:01:22,190
Look.

3606
03:01:22,690 --> 03:01:23,490
Naughty boy.

3607
03:01:24,010 --> 03:01:24,750
The fuck?

3608
03:01:24,830 --> 03:01:26,150
Don't you do it.

3609
03:01:27,650 --> 03:01:28,410
Why?

3610
03:01:29,350 --> 03:01:29,770
Oh.

3611
03:01:37,890 --> 03:01:38,610
That's why.

3612
03:01:40,350 --> 03:01:42,110
That's why they were naughty.

3613
03:01:45,780 --> 03:01:47,720
Aki, thank you for the Twitch prom.

3614
03:01:47,840 --> 03:01:48,540
Thank you, thank you.

3615
03:01:48,620 --> 03:01:50,680
And Purp and Nemesis, thank you for the bitties.

3616
03:01:50,740 --> 03:01:51,440
Thank you, thank you.

3617
03:01:51,760 --> 03:01:56,140
YouTuber fanbase of the year ain't losing to Marvel Rivals.

3618
03:01:56,920 --> 03:01:57,260
Oh, hey.

3619
03:01:57,280 --> 03:01:58,000
Hello is unlocked.

3620
03:02:04,300 --> 03:02:04,740
Any...

3621
03:02:05,400 --> 03:02:07,120
Any hello players?

3622
03:02:10,220 --> 03:02:11,380
Any hellos?

3623
03:02:12,520 --> 03:02:13,680
Hello players?

3624
03:02:14,820 --> 03:02:15,620
Any... No?

3625
03:02:15,920 --> 03:02:16,640
That's cool.

3626
03:02:16,960 --> 03:02:17,760
We don't need hello.

3627
03:02:19,470 --> 03:02:20,740
We don't need her.

3628
03:02:23,940 --> 03:02:24,520
Hello?

3629
03:02:24,860 --> 03:02:25,780
Hello, hello?

3630
03:02:29,020 --> 03:02:29,600
No?

3631
03:02:29,900 --> 03:02:30,360
It's alright.

3632
03:02:30,560 --> 03:02:31,220
We don't need hello.

3633
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:34,740
Hello is for pussies, right?

3634
03:02:35,160 --> 03:02:36,100
We don't need her.

3635
03:02:36,100 --> 03:02:37,640
Superpowers are amazing.

3636
03:02:37,800 --> 03:02:41,940
Marvel Rivals has a moon and Dookie Bird is one of them.

3637
03:02:43,940 --> 03:02:45,380
They'll be coming in 30 seconds.

3638
03:02:49,800 --> 03:02:51,680
The actual Magneto.

3639
03:02:52,180 --> 03:02:54,020
Guys, I thought you were supporting me.

3640
03:02:54,120 --> 03:02:54,800
What happened?

3641
03:02:54,960 --> 03:03:00,060
Isn't it should be like, if Dookie Bird has a... Guys, wait.

3642
03:03:00,180 --> 03:03:01,980
I thought you guys would support me.

3643
03:03:02,140 --> 03:03:03,420
It blew my face.

3644
03:03:04,080 --> 03:03:05,640
Alright, have a seat.

3645
03:03:05,640 --> 03:03:06,920
Boom!

3646
03:03:07,380 --> 03:03:08,180
Now I have 20 seconds.

3647
03:03:08,300 --> 03:03:08,920
Oh, fuck.

3648
03:03:09,240 --> 03:03:10,920
This match starts in 5 seconds.

3649
03:03:11,340 --> 03:03:11,780
Oh!

3650
03:03:14,860 --> 03:03:16,560
Already throwing.

3651
03:03:19,340 --> 03:03:20,220
Alright.

3652
03:03:22,680 --> 03:03:23,960
It's fine.

3653
03:03:26,540 --> 03:03:27,200
Alright.

3654
03:03:30,880 --> 03:03:33,360
Oh, that's unfortunate.

3655
03:03:33,360 --> 03:03:34,840
Oh.

3656
03:03:36,540 --> 03:03:38,740
I need to give it to our flankers.

3657
03:03:39,380 --> 03:03:41,820
That's very unfortunate.

3658
03:03:43,040 --> 03:03:44,520
What the fuck?

3659
03:03:44,600 --> 03:03:46,240
Where did she come from?

3660
03:03:46,660 --> 03:03:49,380
I didn't even know she existed until now.

3661
03:03:52,060 --> 03:03:52,840
Alright.

3662
03:03:53,340 --> 03:03:54,780
I froze Magneto.

3663
03:03:56,060 --> 03:03:57,960
Magneto is not frozen anymore.

3664
03:03:58,980 --> 03:03:59,320
Alright.

3665
03:03:59,320 --> 03:03:59,420
Alright.

3666
03:04:01,600 --> 03:04:02,160
Woah.

3667
03:04:02,960 --> 03:04:03,460
Woah.

3668
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:06,820
You taught me offenses?

3669
03:04:09,720 --> 03:04:10,520
It's fine.

3670
03:04:11,560 --> 03:04:13,780
I don't know what's going on, but it's okay.

3671
03:04:15,800 --> 03:04:17,300
I think he's doing it.

3672
03:04:17,340 --> 03:04:18,820
I think they're doing it, guys.

3673
03:04:21,880 --> 03:04:23,860
Wait, there's a Loki behind.

3674
03:04:24,900 --> 03:04:26,960
I got the Loki clone.

3675
03:04:26,960 --> 03:04:28,840
Oh my god.

3676
03:04:31,340 --> 03:04:32,440
It's fine.

3677
03:04:32,940 --> 03:04:33,880
That's fine.

3678
03:04:36,580 --> 03:04:37,820
Is this strange pushing me?

3679
03:04:46,420 --> 03:04:47,360
That's alright.

3680
03:04:49,180 --> 03:04:50,240
That's okay.

3681
03:04:50,580 --> 03:04:53,080
We're being pushed up right now, but that's okay.

3682
03:04:53,660 --> 03:04:54,820
That's so okay.

3683
03:04:55,480 --> 03:04:59,540
Our tank just needs to push up just even a little bit.

3684
03:04:59,780 --> 03:05:00,500
Really?

3685
03:05:00,680 --> 03:05:01,800
That's really it?

3686
03:05:01,800 --> 03:05:03,200
Alright.

3687
03:05:03,700 --> 03:05:03,780
Woah!

3688
03:05:04,880 --> 03:05:05,960
That's fine.

3689
03:05:06,160 --> 03:05:07,060
Play on cart again.

3690
03:05:08,540 --> 03:05:09,260
Alright.

3691
03:05:09,560 --> 03:05:10,240
There's Magneto behind.

3692
03:05:11,800 --> 03:05:12,100
Oh!

3693
03:05:13,380 --> 03:05:14,500
They have strange ult.

3694
03:05:17,480 --> 03:05:22,060
And we don't really have anything for that, so...

3695
03:05:22,060 --> 03:05:24,680
Let's hope everything will be okay!

3696
03:05:27,620 --> 03:05:29,300
I'll give it to...

3697
03:05:29,300 --> 03:05:33,280
Oh, I was gonna give it to her Fister, but that's alright.

3698
03:05:34,760 --> 03:05:37,420
I can't give it to her Fister, so that's alright.

3699
03:05:37,840 --> 03:05:38,780
Strange is looking for an ult.

3700
03:05:39,900 --> 03:05:40,440
He's to our left!

3701
03:05:40,480 --> 03:05:40,980
He's to our left!

3702
03:05:41,180 --> 03:05:41,760
He's looking for it.

3703
03:05:46,080 --> 03:05:46,860
Oh my god.

3704
03:05:51,520 --> 03:05:53,160
I can't help you over there, Mantis.

3705
03:05:58,040 --> 03:05:59,320
Oh my god.

3706
03:06:01,320 --> 03:06:01,760
Oh my god.

3707
03:06:01,760 --> 03:06:02,920
They're gonna strange ult after this.

3708
03:06:08,040 --> 03:06:08,620
He's looking for it!

3709
03:06:08,620 --> 03:06:09,200
He's looking for it now!

3710
03:06:10,080 --> 03:06:10,540
I froze him!

3711
03:06:11,480 --> 03:06:11,840
He's won!

3712
03:06:11,900 --> 03:06:12,140
He's won!

3713
03:06:14,920 --> 03:06:16,060
Oh my god!

3714
03:06:17,500 --> 03:06:18,120
Sick freeze!

3715
03:06:18,780 --> 03:06:20,760
Nobody's gonna see it, so I compliment myself.

3716
03:06:20,820 --> 03:06:21,940
Guys, please boost my ego.

3717
03:06:22,240 --> 03:06:25,180
That was actually a fucking crazy freeze right there.

3718
03:06:25,540 --> 03:06:27,320
Guys, where is my ego boosters?

3719
03:06:27,320 --> 03:06:28,040
Where?

3720
03:06:30,200 --> 03:06:35,360
Guys, I need my chat to be like, wow, that was fucking sick, Doki.

3721
03:06:36,140 --> 03:06:39,400
Wow, you basically saved the game!

3722
03:06:39,880 --> 03:06:40,980
Wow, that's great!

3723
03:06:41,380 --> 03:06:43,460
Nobody's gonna compliment me for that!

3724
03:06:43,500 --> 03:06:44,620
That's fucking fine.

3725
03:06:44,760 --> 03:06:46,000
Heroes don't need compliments.

3726
03:06:47,180 --> 03:06:49,320
Whoa, huge freeze!

3727
03:06:49,520 --> 03:06:49,960
Thank you.

3728
03:06:50,280 --> 03:06:52,100
Thank you, I really needed that.

3729
03:06:54,340 --> 03:06:56,140
That's a huge ult, huge ult for my Shade.

3730
03:07:00,440 --> 03:07:01,240
I got you.

3731
03:07:04,320 --> 03:07:05,420
I'm ulting, I'm ulting this.

3732
03:07:07,100 --> 03:07:08,160
Play on point, you can.

3733
03:07:12,360 --> 03:07:13,200
Oh my god!

3734
03:07:16,220 --> 03:07:16,660
Oh!

3735
03:07:18,820 --> 03:07:19,440
I froze Hela!

3736
03:07:19,540 --> 03:07:19,920
I froze Hela!

3737
03:07:23,780 --> 03:07:24,800
Oh my god!

3738
03:07:26,360 --> 03:07:27,180
Oh my god!

3739
03:07:27,240 --> 03:07:28,100
Oh my god, strangers low, strangers half!

3740
03:07:29,960 --> 03:07:30,880
I need heals.

3741
03:07:33,680 --> 03:07:35,540
I need heals really bad.

3742
03:07:38,820 --> 03:07:41,280
Oh my god!

3743
03:07:42,380 --> 03:07:43,320
Oh my god!

3744
03:07:47,680 --> 03:07:49,140
Can we touch cart?

3745
03:07:52,160 --> 03:07:53,560
Oh, goodbye, strange.

3746
03:07:56,800 --> 03:07:58,180
Fucking bye!

3747
03:08:02,030 --> 03:08:03,320
Oh my god.

3748
03:08:06,410 --> 03:08:07,650
So close.

3749
03:08:07,750 --> 03:08:09,370
I just got my ult too.

3750
03:08:09,770 --> 03:08:10,770
That fucking sucked.

3751
03:08:11,610 --> 03:08:13,370
I literally just got my ult.

3752
03:08:13,750 --> 03:08:14,750
Oh my god.

3753
03:08:15,710 --> 03:08:17,510
It was so close.

3754
03:08:21,300 --> 03:08:23,660
Jesus Christ, our poor Black Panther.

3755
03:08:24,200 --> 03:08:28,160
I don't wanna stand next to them.

3756
03:08:28,640 --> 03:08:35,260
Oh my god, please.

3757
03:08:35,440 --> 03:08:36,700
They're just pushing up.

3758
03:08:37,380 --> 03:08:39,200
They're just free pushing it.

3759
03:08:40,760 --> 03:08:42,740
We can push up with this, help our Hela.

3760
03:08:48,080 --> 03:08:48,560
Please.

3761
03:08:48,800 --> 03:08:49,580
Okay, I'm ulting this.

3762
03:08:51,700 --> 03:08:52,880
I'm gonna play near cart.

3763
03:08:56,400 --> 03:08:57,360
Please, please!

3764
03:08:57,360 --> 03:08:58,780
Push near!

3765
03:08:59,220 --> 03:09:00,940
Oh my god!

3766
03:09:01,180 --> 03:09:02,500
Not Magneto!

3767
03:09:04,520 --> 03:09:07,420
Why are ticks so push back?

3768
03:09:10,080 --> 03:09:14,700
Why are ticks not fucking push close together?

3769
03:09:16,340 --> 03:09:18,680
I don't understand.

3770
03:09:19,620 --> 03:09:22,780
Why are ticks just fucking give up?

3771
03:09:24,460 --> 03:09:25,240
Like...

3772
03:09:25,240 --> 03:09:26,960
Just go up!

3773
03:09:36,420 --> 03:09:38,600
Wait, push up with that, push up with that.

3774
03:09:40,880 --> 03:09:41,660
Please.

3775
03:09:46,640 --> 03:09:47,320
Nice.

3776
03:09:47,840 --> 03:09:49,540
Oh my god, we finally pushed up.

3777
03:09:49,680 --> 03:09:51,040
We finally...

3778
03:09:51,040 --> 03:09:53,700
We finally pushed up.

3779
03:09:53,800 --> 03:09:54,780
That's fucking crazy.

3780
03:09:55,220 --> 03:09:57,220
We actually played up.

3781
03:09:57,460 --> 03:09:59,520
That's actually crazy.

3782
03:09:59,720 --> 03:10:00,680
Oh my god.

3783
03:10:00,680 --> 03:10:03,340
I'm so proud of all of you.

3784
03:10:03,640 --> 03:10:08,460
Like, you guys did the bare minimum of what a tank should be able to do.

3785
03:10:08,680 --> 03:10:10,280
Isn't that insane?

3786
03:10:11,720 --> 03:10:12,920
Holy fuck!

3787
03:10:13,720 --> 03:10:17,960
The absolute bare minimum of a tank player.

3788
03:10:20,480 --> 03:10:22,080
Oh, they should have strangled here.

3789
03:10:25,340 --> 03:10:26,680
Unless they used it.

3790
03:10:27,320 --> 03:10:28,380
Wait, unless they used it.

3791
03:10:28,380 --> 03:10:29,820
Actually, I don't think they used it.

3792
03:10:30,000 --> 03:10:30,180
Nevermind.

3793
03:10:31,140 --> 03:10:31,960
I forgot.

3794
03:10:37,370 --> 03:10:40,050
Oh my god, I'm fucking getting my ults confused.

3795
03:10:42,950 --> 03:10:44,270
They should have magic ult here.

3796
03:10:58,260 --> 03:10:58,920
Oh no!

3797
03:10:59,620 --> 03:10:59,960
No, I

3798
03:11:03,440 --> 03:11:03,860
couldn't!

3799
03:11:04,360 --> 03:11:05,580
Oh my god.

3800
03:11:09,490 --> 03:11:11,050
Oh, you can mantis ult first.

3801
03:11:21,750 --> 03:11:22,630
Jesus Christ.

3802
03:11:24,150 --> 03:11:25,950
We can push up with mantis ult, can't we?

3803
03:11:28,710 --> 03:11:29,410
Let's do it!

3804
03:11:30,010 --> 03:11:30,910
Push with this, push with this!

3805
03:11:33,790 --> 03:11:35,110
Oh, hell is one, hell is one!

3806
03:11:36,770 --> 03:11:40,510
Uh, strange, strange, strange.

3807
03:11:43,190 --> 03:11:44,810
We might be able- if we push up, they can't touch.

3808
03:11:49,990 --> 03:11:50,770
Are they TPing?

3809
03:11:50,870 --> 03:11:51,650
We can get rid of TP.

3810
03:11:51,650 --> 03:11:51,770
TP.

3811
03:11:54,850 --> 03:11:55,690
Yeah, see?

3812
03:11:57,710 --> 03:11:58,070
Woo!

3813
03:11:59,050 --> 03:12:02,530
I love how you run for your life every time.

3814
03:12:03,050 --> 03:12:07,030
Like, what else can I do?

3815
03:12:07,210 --> 03:12:08,830
I can't freeze him!

3816
03:12:09,310 --> 03:12:15,890
I can't, I can't, I can't fucking freeze him.

3817
03:12:16,030 --> 03:12:17,670
What the fuck do I do?

3818
03:12:17,670 --> 03:12:23,070
Like, he literally says fear magneto.

3819
03:12:23,250 --> 03:12:25,670
You fucking damn wrong with a fear magneto.

3820
03:12:29,650 --> 03:12:33,230
Just freeze the big metal ball.

3821
03:12:37,360 --> 03:12:40,810
I hear free magneto and I fucking run.

3822
03:12:41,150 --> 03:12:43,490
I just, I can't.

3823
03:12:44,510 --> 03:12:45,870
Bro, how is he 4-4?

3824
03:12:45,870 --> 03:12:48,230
I gave you orb!

3825
03:12:55,870 --> 03:12:58,950
She bravely runs away.

3826
03:13:09,670 --> 03:13:12,110
The orb does so much.

3827
03:13:12,190 --> 03:13:13,010
I'm gonna give it to plant.

3828
03:13:13,010 --> 03:13:15,210
I didn't realize he has orb.

3829
03:13:15,810 --> 03:13:19,010
What the fuck?!

3830
03:13:24,310 --> 03:13:27,030
Bro, these are some fucking hours.

3831
03:13:29,210 --> 03:13:31,050
This is the shot that ends the war, guys.

3832
03:13:31,130 --> 03:13:31,990
We're doing it again.

3833
03:13:33,130 --> 03:13:35,790
This is the rival that ends the war.

3834
03:13:36,330 --> 03:13:38,830
We're doing it again.

3835
03:13:40,250 --> 03:13:41,370
Oh, I shouldn't have clapped.

3836
03:13:41,410 --> 03:13:42,990
No, clapping early is fine.

3837
03:13:43,410 --> 03:13:44,890
Like, they were all lining up for it.

3838
03:13:45,130 --> 03:13:45,330
Anyway.

3839
03:13:47,910 --> 03:13:48,350
Hey, well done.

3840
03:13:51,650 --> 03:13:52,810
Oh my god.

3841
03:13:54,130 --> 03:13:57,190
You guys, you guys take way too much damage.

3842
03:13:58,570 --> 03:13:59,950
Yes, actually.

3843
03:14:04,150 --> 03:14:06,370
Holy shit, that damage was insane.

3844
03:14:10,340 --> 03:14:13,020
I'm just gonna orb the tanks, like, fuck this.

3845
03:14:15,160 --> 03:14:17,720
Like, they take way too much damage.

3846
03:14:20,100 --> 03:14:20,600
Grit's low.

3847
03:14:21,320 --> 03:14:21,840
Nevermind.

3848
03:14:22,600 --> 03:14:23,060
Hey, Grit, go!

3849
03:14:25,780 --> 03:14:26,820
Holy shit!

3850
03:14:27,900 --> 03:14:28,800
Oh, magic saw me.

3851
03:14:33,320 --> 03:14:34,500
Grit's low, Grit's half.

3852
03:14:37,400 --> 03:14:38,440
Jesus Christ!

3853
03:14:40,960 --> 03:14:45,340
I don't know if I should ult, though, because we don't have any defensive ults, so it's scarier.

3854
03:14:45,780 --> 03:14:47,520
It's a lot scarier.

3855
03:14:51,550 --> 03:14:52,190
Come on, Grit.

3856
03:14:52,370 --> 03:14:52,930
I'm ulting.

3857
03:14:57,350 --> 03:14:58,250
Oh, they have health.

3858
03:15:08,730 --> 03:15:10,150
Jesus Christ, Grit, Grit, Grit, Grit, one!

3859
03:15:10,210 --> 03:15:10,510
Grit, one!

3860
03:15:25,260 --> 03:15:26,080
my God.

3861
03:15:26,080 --> 03:15:26,560
Stop, fear!

3862
03:15:27,120 --> 03:15:27,540
No!

3863
03:15:30,420 --> 03:15:32,200
We're all grouped together.

3864
03:15:33,120 --> 03:15:34,440
Oh, my God.

3865
03:15:34,940 --> 03:15:37,240
Truth, fear, oh, my God.

3866
03:15:37,480 --> 03:15:39,160
There was the fear.

3867
03:15:39,760 --> 03:15:42,120
There was the... I told you guys.

3868
03:15:43,080 --> 03:15:44,660
Fear Magneto.

3869
03:15:48,320 --> 03:15:49,280
Fear Magneto.

3870
03:15:49,280 --> 03:15:49,400
Fear Magneto.

3871
03:15:52,560 --> 03:15:54,040
I told you.

3872
03:15:54,520 --> 03:15:56,400
Guys, this is not looking so great.

3873
03:15:56,780 --> 03:15:57,340
Magneto's one.

3874
03:16:05,040 --> 03:16:06,540
Oh, my God, there was someone that was low.

3875
03:16:06,980 --> 03:16:08,140
Oh, my God.

3876
03:16:09,340 --> 03:16:11,900
There's so... Grit, Grit, Grit, Grit, Grit, one, Grit, one.

3877
03:16:12,220 --> 03:16:12,580
Grit's low.

3878
03:16:13,300 --> 03:16:14,040
Focus Grit, please.

3879
03:16:14,860 --> 03:16:15,680
Oh, thank God.

3880
03:16:16,160 --> 03:16:17,740
There's a Magik behind me.

3881
03:16:17,820 --> 03:16:18,300
I had to ult.

3882
03:16:18,700 --> 03:16:19,280
There's a Magik behind.

3883
03:16:20,260 --> 03:16:22,380
Magik on cart, Magik on cart.

3884
03:16:25,120 --> 03:16:25,960
Oh, my God.

3885
03:16:26,220 --> 03:16:29,180
I have no ult for Grit ult, so we gotta be careful.

3886
03:16:32,420 --> 03:16:33,980
We can have four on cart, maybe.

3887
03:16:36,860 --> 03:16:37,620
I'm gonna try and freeze.

3888
03:16:39,480 --> 03:16:40,140
Oh, no!

3889
03:16:40,860 --> 03:16:41,720
Careful Grit ult here.

3890
03:16:46,640 --> 03:16:46,940
He's coming over.

3891
03:16:49,680 --> 03:16:50,380
Magneto's one.

3892
03:16:50,480 --> 03:16:50,940
Magneto's one.

3893
03:16:53,220 --> 03:16:55,020
I froze Magik behind me.

3894
03:16:55,160 --> 03:16:55,640
Find the heals.

3895
03:16:59,500 --> 03:17:00,120
Oh, my God.

3896
03:17:00,980 --> 03:17:01,540
Alright.

3897
03:17:03,140 --> 03:17:03,700
Yippee.

3898
03:17:06,340 --> 03:17:08,100
Oh, my God.

3899
03:17:08,180 --> 03:17:09,620
Thank you for the huge freeze.

3900
03:17:09,900 --> 03:17:11,640
I really appreciate it.

3901
03:17:11,840 --> 03:17:12,920
Thank you, guys.

3902
03:17:12,920 --> 03:17:14,260
Nobody else will compliment.

3903
03:17:14,600 --> 03:17:15,040
I'll push up.

3904
03:17:15,100 --> 03:17:15,780
Can you stay on cart?

3905
03:17:21,670 --> 03:17:22,270
Alright.

3906
03:17:22,990 --> 03:17:24,170
Here we go.

3907
03:17:25,470 --> 03:17:26,810
There's a Hella up top.

3908
03:17:33,950 --> 03:17:34,590
Oh, my God.

3909
03:17:35,650 --> 03:17:36,250
Please.

3910
03:17:36,630 --> 03:17:39,530
That tree was so fucking scary.

3911
03:17:40,630 --> 03:17:41,230
Nice.

3912
03:17:43,510 --> 03:17:44,370
Hella, hella, hella, hella.

3913
03:17:44,370 --> 03:17:44,670
Oh.

3914
03:17:47,790 --> 03:17:49,930
I'm stuck back here.

3915
03:17:57,340 --> 03:17:58,100
That's fine.

3916
03:17:58,180 --> 03:17:59,380
I get to be alive.

3917
03:18:03,790 --> 03:18:04,610
That's fine.

3918
03:18:07,290 --> 03:18:07,930
I can push up.

3919
03:18:08,150 --> 03:18:08,670
I have ult here.

3920
03:18:10,190 --> 03:18:10,870
Wait, what?

3921
03:18:11,030 --> 03:18:11,310
I'm ulting.

3922
03:18:11,430 --> 03:18:11,670
I'm ulting.

3923
03:18:15,090 --> 03:18:16,570
Just group up around me.

3924
03:18:17,230 --> 03:18:18,330
I'm pushing up with my ult.

3925
03:18:20,950 --> 03:18:22,270
Okay, I'm backing out in two.

3926
03:18:24,770 --> 03:18:25,830
Oh, please.

3927
03:18:26,290 --> 03:18:26,690
Group, group, group.

3928
03:18:27,710 --> 03:18:28,790
Oh, my God.

3929
03:18:29,170 --> 03:18:29,650
Please.

3930
03:18:32,950 --> 03:18:33,590
Please.

3931
03:18:33,730 --> 03:18:35,210
I'm trying my best.

3932
03:18:35,550 --> 03:18:35,850
Oh.

3933
03:18:37,050 --> 03:18:38,690
Oh, my God.

3934
03:18:38,790 --> 03:18:39,890
I'm trying.

3935
03:18:42,250 --> 03:18:44,430
All I do is heal.

3936
03:18:53,750 --> 03:18:54,930
Oh, my God.

3937
03:19:01,350 --> 03:19:01,910
Oh, my God.

3938
03:19:02,850 --> 03:19:04,010
Where are we?

3939
03:19:04,370 --> 03:19:04,590
Oh.

3940
03:19:14,670 --> 03:19:16,430
There's a magic behind you guys.

3941
03:19:17,910 --> 03:19:18,490
There's one.

3942
03:19:18,590 --> 03:19:18,950
There's one.

3943
03:19:19,910 --> 03:19:21,290
Can we have, like, three on cart at least?

3944
03:19:22,250 --> 03:19:22,670
Or four.

3945
03:19:22,890 --> 03:19:23,630
That's the max speed.

3946
03:19:28,310 --> 03:19:29,710
I can try and freeze someone.

3947
03:19:32,330 --> 03:19:34,230
They might have a chance to touch.

3948
03:19:38,480 --> 03:19:38,840
Oh.

3949
03:19:39,420 --> 03:19:41,540
Frozen, frozen, frozen, frozen, frozen, frozen.

3950
03:19:42,200 --> 03:19:42,560
No.

3951
03:19:51,950 --> 03:19:52,410
McNeil's one.

3952
03:19:52,470 --> 03:19:52,990
McNeil's one.

3953
03:19:53,530 --> 03:19:53,990
Gryff's low, too.

3954
03:19:54,010 --> 03:19:54,510
Gryff's low.

3955
03:19:55,730 --> 03:19:56,090
Gryff's one.

3956
03:19:56,150 --> 03:19:56,510
Gryff's one.

3957
03:19:58,930 --> 03:19:59,390
At him.

3958
03:19:59,470 --> 03:19:59,710
At him.

3959
03:19:59,850 --> 03:20:00,290
At him, mommy.

3960
03:20:00,350 --> 03:20:00,570
At him.

3961
03:20:01,890 --> 03:20:02,730
Oh, my God.

3962
03:20:02,770 --> 03:20:03,630
I didn't use it.

3963
03:20:04,770 --> 03:20:08,230
Bro, why did no one look at magic after I freeze her?

3964
03:20:09,890 --> 03:20:12,150
Why does no one ever look?

3965
03:20:13,090 --> 03:20:14,850
Uh, Mantis, you can push up for heals.

3966
03:20:15,190 --> 03:20:15,990
I already have my ult.

3967
03:20:20,360 --> 03:20:21,040
Again.

3968
03:20:26,390 --> 03:20:27,210
Spacer support.

3969
03:20:31,750 --> 03:20:33,950
Move, move, move.

3970
03:20:34,130 --> 03:20:34,410
Nice.

3971
03:20:37,760 --> 03:20:38,140
Ah!

3972
03:20:39,060 --> 03:20:40,260
I'm alive!

3973
03:20:40,840 --> 03:20:41,520
Bitch!

3974
03:20:59,050 --> 03:21:00,450
Oh, Gryff, Gryff, Gryff, Gryff.

3975
03:21:01,210 --> 03:21:01,590
That's nice.

3976
03:21:01,650 --> 03:21:01,910
That's good.

3977
03:21:02,010 --> 03:21:02,390
I'm gonna ult this.

3978
03:21:02,470 --> 03:21:03,370
I'm gonna ult this and push forward.

3979
03:21:03,790 --> 03:21:04,490
Ult this and push forward.

3980
03:21:10,390 --> 03:21:10,750
Yay!

3981
03:21:16,630 --> 03:21:17,610
We did it!

3982
03:21:19,830 --> 03:21:20,570
Oh, my God.

3983
03:21:20,650 --> 03:21:23,630
Didn't pat my Wolverine, though.

3984
03:21:26,010 --> 03:21:26,690
Oh, my God.

3985
03:21:26,690 --> 03:21:27,650
I know I feared Magneto.

3986
03:21:27,790 --> 03:21:28,450
I literally ran.

3987
03:21:29,390 --> 03:21:31,950
I ran like a little bitch every time.

3988
03:21:32,070 --> 03:21:32,530
I...

3989
03:21:33,990 --> 03:21:36,170
Fucking fuck Magneto, bro.

3990
03:21:36,370 --> 03:21:39,230
Oh, my God.

3991
03:21:39,590 --> 03:21:42,030
This is actually painful games right now.

3992
03:21:42,270 --> 03:21:44,610
These games are so fucking painful.

3993
03:21:46,150 --> 03:21:47,510
I could've...

3994
03:21:47,510 --> 03:21:54,490
If I didn't get like 15 earlier and actually got 20, I could've fucking got my Eternity back.

3995
03:21:54,730 --> 03:21:56,850
I could've got it back.

3996
03:21:57,870 --> 03:22:05,510
I keep like a list of people that are Eternity and GMs, but I just keep them there, because I don't know who they are.

3997
03:22:05,710 --> 03:22:06,730
Oh, I know this guy!

3998
03:22:07,190 --> 03:22:09,330
If you get Eternity back, I'll put you on my friends list.

3999
03:22:09,670 --> 03:22:11,770
But you're doom queuing, so I'm sorry.

4000
03:22:12,010 --> 03:22:12,870
Oh, Mac.

4001
03:22:12,930 --> 03:22:13,430
Oh, no.

4002
03:22:13,750 --> 03:22:14,730
Oh, no.

4003
03:22:20,590 --> 03:22:22,210
Oh, no.

4004
03:22:22,710 --> 03:22:23,630
Oh, no.

4005
03:22:23,630 --> 03:22:24,650
Oh, we're all suffering.

4006
03:22:25,590 --> 03:22:26,770
Oh, no.

4007
03:22:27,610 --> 03:22:29,570
Oh, that's so fucking rough.

4008
03:22:29,630 --> 03:22:32,050
He was Eternity for one game.

4009
03:22:32,390 --> 03:22:33,630
That's so rough.

4010
03:22:37,010 --> 03:22:37,970
Misery.

4011
03:22:42,770 --> 03:22:47,150
Oh, the actual misery there.

4012
03:22:49,490 --> 03:22:51,610
Misery loves comfort.

4013
03:22:51,750 --> 03:22:53,490
No, I do not!

4014
03:22:54,250 --> 03:22:55,850
I do not.

4015
03:22:56,710 --> 03:22:58,150
Oh, he's going through it.

4016
03:22:58,990 --> 03:23:00,410
I'm sorry, Mac.

4017
03:23:00,950 --> 03:23:03,190
The doom queue is upon you.

4018
03:23:03,330 --> 03:23:04,330
I'm sorry.

4019
03:23:06,290 --> 03:23:07,950
It's a doggy.

4020
03:23:07,950 --> 03:23:09,750
Dog world.

4021
03:23:10,890 --> 03:23:13,170
Oh, we're queue dodging, apparently.

4022
03:23:14,790 --> 03:23:16,590
You can stop the doom queue.

4023
03:23:16,810 --> 03:23:18,450
There's still time.

4024
03:23:19,090 --> 03:23:20,110
I can't.

4025
03:23:20,450 --> 03:23:22,390
It's too late for him.

4026
03:23:22,530 --> 03:23:23,930
It's too late.

4027
03:23:24,390 --> 03:23:33,090
He fucking mentally imploded and picked Black Panther and then yelled at our other... and then yelled at their team.

4028
03:23:33,470 --> 03:23:37,290
At that point, I was like, there's no saving you anymore, Mac.

4029
03:23:37,410 --> 03:23:39,310
It's too late to...

4030
03:23:39,310 --> 03:23:42,490
Even when I was like, Mac, can you play Starlord?

4031
03:23:46,190 --> 03:23:51,210
And Mac was like, and Mac was just like, it's not me.

4032
03:23:51,390 --> 03:23:52,670
And I'm like, oh.

4033
03:23:55,850 --> 03:23:57,110
We've lost him.

4034
03:23:58,270 --> 03:24:01,370
That's when I knew we lost him and I couldn't...

4035
03:24:01,370 --> 03:24:03,530
I couldn't save him no more.

4036
03:24:07,430 --> 03:24:08,810
0-7 the Mac.

4037
03:24:08,990 --> 03:24:10,870
I hope he...

4038
03:24:10,870 --> 03:24:11,850
0-7.

4039
03:24:12,170 --> 03:24:12,750
I hope...

4040
03:24:12,750 --> 03:24:13,950
I hope he recovers.

4041
03:24:14,310 --> 03:24:15,430
I really do.

4042
03:24:26,350 --> 03:24:28,210
I'm not Luna one trick.

4043
03:24:28,370 --> 03:24:29,610
It's just she's really good.

4044
03:24:33,190 --> 03:24:34,730
I swear I'm not Luna one trick.

4045
03:24:35,710 --> 03:24:37,470
She's just our best character.

4046
03:24:37,970 --> 03:24:39,830
I can play other characters.

4047
03:24:46,300 --> 03:24:50,500
I can play every support except for Loki.

4048
03:24:51,260 --> 03:24:51,980
Except for Loki.

4049
03:24:52,780 --> 03:24:54,160
Jeff is not in question.

4050
03:24:54,700 --> 03:24:56,200
Jeff is actually just...

4051
03:24:56,200 --> 03:24:58,500
See, I'm gonna prove it to you right now.

4052
03:25:01,360 --> 03:25:02,960
Alright, well, Luna's bad.

4053
03:25:09,040 --> 03:25:09,680
What?

4054
03:25:10,420 --> 03:25:10,940
Luna's bad?

4055
03:25:11,280 --> 03:25:13,180
Okay, that's alright.

4056
03:25:15,080 --> 03:25:16,800
No, Luna gets banned all the time.

4057
03:25:16,820 --> 03:25:19,460
I'm surprised this is the first Luna ban I've had.

4058
03:25:20,300 --> 03:25:24,780
Okay, just ban Bruce Banner if you don't want to play against Ironman.

4059
03:25:25,440 --> 03:25:27,020
It's literally that easy.

4060
03:25:31,820 --> 03:25:35,820
Bro, they banned me Ironman.

4061
03:25:36,580 --> 03:25:37,580
The fuck?

4062
03:25:38,140 --> 03:25:40,880
They really don't like Bruce Banner and Ironman.

4063
03:25:41,840 --> 03:25:42,340
They really?

4064
03:25:45,860 --> 03:25:48,480
Well, Moon Knight is good on certain maps.

4065
03:25:48,800 --> 03:25:52,440
It's the T'Challa map, the Wakanda one.

4066
03:25:54,400 --> 03:25:56,040
The Wakanda map's really good for...

4067
03:25:58,740 --> 03:26:01,040
Really good for...

4068
03:26:02,000 --> 03:26:03,280
This map again?

4069
03:26:03,660 --> 03:26:05,080
I feel like we haven't played any Ka.

4070
03:26:05,080 --> 03:26:08,800
We've just been playing Kart, Push.

4071
03:26:11,420 --> 03:26:13,560
We've just been playing Push maps.

4072
03:26:16,220 --> 03:26:18,240
Did I play one Ka game?

4073
03:26:18,780 --> 03:26:19,600
Oh yeah, I did.

4074
03:26:19,660 --> 03:26:20,400
I remember now.

4075
03:26:20,800 --> 03:26:22,020
I remember playing one Ka game.

4076
03:26:22,400 --> 03:26:24,300
No, they heard me.

4077
03:26:24,560 --> 03:26:30,000
They heard me because Kendrick Lamar fucking pushed up when I said go up and do support ults.

4078
03:26:30,160 --> 03:26:32,860
Everybody else just acknowledged me as the spokesperson of the team.

4079
03:26:36,340 --> 03:26:37,520
3... 2...

4080
03:26:37,520 --> 03:26:37,960
1!

4081
03:26:40,600 --> 03:26:41,640
Hey, we won.

4082
03:26:43,500 --> 03:26:44,100
Oh,

4083
03:26:49,290 --> 03:26:50,370
there's somebody behind us?

4084
03:26:50,590 --> 03:26:51,550
Or is that Black Panther behind?

4085
03:26:53,470 --> 03:26:54,750
Oh no, it's Venom.

4086
03:26:54,990 --> 03:26:56,070
Haha, JK.

4087
03:26:57,710 --> 03:26:58,770
Oh, Venom's low.

4088
03:26:58,830 --> 03:26:59,150
Venom won.

4089
03:27:02,190 --> 03:27:02,790
Alright.

4090
03:27:08,050 --> 03:27:08,610
There's one.

4091
03:27:09,810 --> 03:27:10,910
Oh my gosh.

4092
03:27:11,370 --> 03:27:13,170
I don't have heals right now.

4093
03:27:16,840 --> 03:27:17,860
Oh my god.

4094
03:27:18,860 --> 03:27:19,660
I'm trying my best.

4095
03:27:22,620 --> 03:27:23,100
Venom's low.

4096
03:27:23,200 --> 03:27:23,580
Venom's high.

4097
03:27:28,770 --> 03:27:30,070
Oh my god, please.

4098
03:27:31,150 --> 03:27:31,590
Damage!

4099
03:27:31,730 --> 03:27:32,510
You don't need heals.

4100
03:27:32,750 --> 03:27:34,810
Oh, I wish I could heal you right now.

4101
03:27:35,210 --> 03:27:36,250
I don't have heals right now, sorry.

4102
03:27:41,170 --> 03:27:42,330
Oh, I'm so sorry.

4103
03:27:47,350 --> 03:27:48,850
Oh my god, please.

4104
03:27:49,950 --> 03:27:52,130
I'm trying my best to keep you up.

4105
03:27:52,930 --> 03:27:53,850
Oh, Venom's low.

4106
03:27:54,030 --> 03:27:54,290
Venom's low.

4107
03:28:00,190 --> 03:28:01,190
I'm going with this.

4108
03:28:01,290 --> 03:28:01,730
I'm going up.

4109
03:28:02,270 --> 03:28:03,050
Push up.

4110
03:28:04,170 --> 03:28:04,830
Strange is half.

4111
03:28:07,870 --> 03:28:08,390
Oh my god.

4112
03:28:08,390 --> 03:28:08,610
Venom behind.

4113
03:28:08,850 --> 03:28:09,370
Venom half.

4114
03:28:12,110 --> 03:28:13,730
They're going to strange all after this.

4115
03:28:21,070 --> 03:28:22,170
Oh, Venom's asleep.

4116
03:28:23,690 --> 03:28:24,490
Rocket one.

4117
03:28:24,630 --> 03:28:25,010
Rocket one.

4118
03:28:28,370 --> 03:28:29,410
Oh my god.

4119
03:28:33,100 --> 03:28:33,860
Black Panther.

4120
03:28:35,500 --> 03:28:36,540
Black Panther on me.

4121
03:28:38,540 --> 03:28:39,020
He's low.

4122
03:28:39,080 --> 03:28:39,320
He's low.

4123
03:28:39,460 --> 03:28:39,840
He's half.

4124
03:28:42,180 --> 03:28:42,680
Oh my god, please.

4125
03:28:42,800 --> 03:28:43,120
He's one.

4126
03:28:50,280 --> 03:28:51,500
They're to the right.

4127
03:28:51,640 --> 03:28:53,040
Rocket raccoon one.

4128
03:28:54,980 --> 03:28:56,120
No, he's so low.

4129
03:28:56,780 --> 03:28:57,900
I'm going to beat you up.

4130
03:28:57,940 --> 03:28:58,480
I'm going to kick you.

4131
03:28:58,980 --> 03:29:01,580
I'm going to kick this raccoon in the...

4132
03:29:01,580 --> 03:29:07,300
Oh my god, please.

4133
03:29:08,280 --> 03:29:09,860
I'm going to run.

4134
03:29:10,860 --> 03:29:13,180
I'm going to fucking kick you.

4135
03:29:19,740 --> 03:29:21,380
That's fucking right.

4136
03:29:24,640 --> 03:29:25,640
Venom right.

4137
03:29:25,880 --> 03:29:26,060
Venom right.

4138
03:29:27,720 --> 03:29:28,400
Venom asleep.

4139
03:29:28,560 --> 03:29:28,880
Venom asleep.

4140
03:29:29,140 --> 03:29:31,700
That was a bit excessive.

4141
03:29:33,060 --> 03:29:33,720
Venom one.

4142
03:29:40,500 --> 03:29:40,940
Please.

4143
03:29:41,140 --> 03:29:41,900
We need to push these guys.

4144
03:29:42,540 --> 03:29:43,720
Yeah, we're up three.

4145
03:29:43,800 --> 03:29:44,440
We can push them.

4146
03:29:44,700 --> 03:29:45,780
Hello one.

4147
03:29:47,560 --> 03:29:49,300
I didn't really know he was one.

4148
03:29:49,400 --> 03:29:50,640
I just say it so people will know.

4149
03:29:51,040 --> 03:29:51,660
They have strange all.

4150
03:29:51,740 --> 03:29:53,860
He's looking for it.

4151
03:29:56,620 --> 03:29:57,680
He has shields broken.

4152
03:30:00,900 --> 03:30:02,460
We back up for that?

4153
03:30:03,000 --> 03:30:04,600
Yeah, I'm backing up.

4154
03:30:10,270 --> 03:30:12,190
Oh no, I couldn't get you.

4155
03:30:14,610 --> 03:30:14,990
Oh no.

4156
03:30:15,950 --> 03:30:17,850
I can use my mantis ult aggressively.

4157
03:30:23,000 --> 03:30:24,040
Jesus Christ.

4158
03:30:24,740 --> 03:30:26,200
I'm running out of leaves.

4159
03:30:28,300 --> 03:30:30,100
You think you can damage boost me?

4160
03:30:30,860 --> 03:30:33,000
Wait, who said that?

4161
03:30:33,800 --> 03:30:34,320
Hella.

4162
03:30:34,640 --> 03:30:35,660
Okay, yeah, I can.

4163
03:30:36,260 --> 03:30:37,280
I'll melt this.

4164
03:30:42,410 --> 03:30:43,330
Alright, I damage boosted you.

4165
03:30:44,530 --> 03:30:45,470
Back to number one.

4166
03:30:45,470 --> 03:30:46,190
Back to number one.

4167
03:30:48,210 --> 03:30:48,890
Push up with that.

4168
03:30:48,950 --> 03:30:50,010
Our Hella is creating space.

4169
03:30:52,230 --> 03:30:53,150
Push up, push up, push up.

4170
03:30:54,050 --> 03:30:54,570
Rocket low.

4171
03:30:54,650 --> 03:30:55,090
Rocket one.

4172
03:30:57,750 --> 03:30:58,390
Strange half.

4173
03:31:01,630 --> 03:31:01,950
Nice!

4174
03:31:03,550 --> 03:31:04,130
Black panther.

4175
03:31:04,210 --> 03:31:04,650
Back to panther.

4176
03:31:07,290 --> 03:31:07,790
He's half.

4177
03:31:07,870 --> 03:31:08,070
He's one.

4178
03:31:08,150 --> 03:31:08,390
He's one.

4179
03:31:08,470 --> 03:31:08,990
He's actually one.

4180
03:31:10,050 --> 03:31:10,890
Strange is pushing up.

4181
03:31:11,010 --> 03:31:11,590
Strange is pushing up.

4182
03:31:12,750 --> 03:31:13,210
He's one.

4183
03:31:13,290 --> 03:31:13,510
He's low.

4184
03:31:13,590 --> 03:31:14,050
He's so low.

4185
03:31:16,910 --> 03:31:17,270
Hella.

4186
03:31:17,530 --> 03:31:17,670
Hella.

4187
03:31:17,790 --> 03:31:18,290
Oh, he has C9.

4188
03:31:21,190 --> 03:31:24,330
I have a magic on me.

4189
03:31:24,410 --> 03:31:25,770
She's asleep though.

4190
03:31:29,430 --> 03:31:30,570
Oh my god.

4191
03:31:31,050 --> 03:31:32,650
Oh my god, they all chase me.

4192
03:31:32,810 --> 03:31:34,310
They C9 as fun as C9.

4193
03:31:36,810 --> 03:31:38,170
Oh my god.

4194
03:31:38,910 --> 03:31:39,430
Oh my god.

4195
03:31:39,530 --> 03:31:40,450
Thank you for the red.

4196
03:31:40,550 --> 03:31:40,810
Thank you.

4197
03:31:43,490 --> 03:31:44,230
Thank you.

4198
03:31:44,890 --> 03:31:46,810
Oh, there's two people to your left.

4199
03:31:49,130 --> 03:31:50,790
Oh my god.

4200
03:31:50,890 --> 03:31:51,990
What the fuck?

4201
03:31:52,370 --> 03:31:54,110
Why is there so many people?

4202
03:31:54,830 --> 03:31:55,490
Hello everybody.

4203
03:31:55,570 --> 03:32:01,670
I usually stream on YouTube, but I'm here doing a Marble Rivals grind because I hate myself.

4204
03:32:04,570 --> 03:32:05,110
It's fine.

4205
03:32:05,110 --> 03:32:05,150
Oh shit.

4206
03:32:09,430 --> 03:32:10,730
Are you damage boosted, Hella?

4207
03:32:15,650 --> 03:32:17,030
Wait, Black Panther one?

4208
03:32:17,930 --> 03:32:18,630
She's so low.

4209
03:32:22,250 --> 03:32:23,530
Oh, sorry Hella.

4210
03:32:25,890 --> 03:32:26,950
Sorry, Hella.

4211
03:32:27,170 --> 03:32:28,830
There was no way to save you there.

4212
03:32:33,070 --> 03:32:34,210
They're using everything.

4213
03:32:36,290 --> 03:32:37,470
They're using everything.

4214
03:32:37,470 --> 03:32:39,730
Yeah, we don't need all here.

4215
03:32:41,890 --> 03:32:42,570
Alright.

4216
03:32:46,270 --> 03:32:47,790
Buddy, I...

4217
03:32:47,790 --> 03:32:52,140
We're coming back.

4218
03:32:52,960 --> 03:32:53,320
No!

4219
03:32:57,830 --> 03:32:59,090
Are they portaling?

4220
03:33:00,810 --> 03:33:01,570
What?

4221
03:33:03,630 --> 03:33:04,210
What is that?

4222
03:33:05,330 --> 03:33:07,130
Oh shit, there's a Black Panther on me.

4223
03:33:09,970 --> 03:33:10,870
Oh my god.

4224
03:33:10,870 --> 03:33:11,370
Oh, he's so...

4225
03:33:11,370 --> 03:33:13,350
No, he's one.

4226
03:33:15,510 --> 03:33:16,850
Oh my god.

4227
03:33:20,110 --> 03:33:20,750
It's fine.

4228
03:33:21,610 --> 03:33:23,050
I have all here.

4229
03:33:26,750 --> 03:33:27,650
That's alright.

4230
03:33:28,390 --> 03:33:29,690
I'm missing my sleeps though.

4231
03:33:30,330 --> 03:33:32,490
I need to get my sleeps up.

4232
03:33:34,310 --> 03:33:34,830
He's...

4233
03:33:34,830 --> 03:33:36,630
I'm saving my sleeps for him, but I'm missing.

4234
03:33:39,650 --> 03:33:41,370
That's the only problem.

4235
03:33:41,730 --> 03:33:44,010
I'm saving it.

4236
03:33:44,610 --> 03:33:47,830
But I'm... Black Panther, I'm ulting this.

4237
03:33:48,230 --> 03:33:49,930
I'm pushing, and we can push up.

4238
03:33:54,950 --> 03:33:55,790
I'm asleep.

4239
03:33:56,330 --> 03:33:57,830
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

4240
03:33:59,590 --> 03:34:00,450
We're even.

4241
03:34:00,450 --> 03:34:02,490
Hella has ult though.

4242
03:34:05,360 --> 03:34:06,320
I'm burning.

4243
03:34:06,420 --> 03:34:07,020
I'm trying to burn Hella.

4244
03:34:07,860 --> 03:34:10,440
Oh no!

4245
03:34:12,900 --> 03:34:15,120
Now the magic pushed up!

4246
03:34:17,660 --> 03:34:18,400
Oh!

4247
03:34:28,720 --> 03:34:29,940
I have 10 seconds left to push.

4248
03:34:34,410 --> 03:34:35,400
Oh no!

4249
03:34:37,990 --> 03:34:38,810
I'm dead!

4250
03:34:39,290 --> 03:34:39,970
We can't!

4251
03:34:44,690 --> 03:34:45,290
Oh no!

4252
03:34:48,370 --> 03:34:50,150
I'm missing my sleeps.

4253
03:34:50,330 --> 03:34:52,310
Oh, I'm missing my sleeps on him.

4254
03:34:55,870 --> 03:34:57,510
I need to focus up on the sleeps.

4255
03:34:57,670 --> 03:34:58,590
Alright, I'm locking in.

4256
03:35:00,130 --> 03:35:01,430
I'm fucking locking in.

4257
03:35:02,030 --> 03:35:04,410
His dash, he times it so well.

4258
03:35:04,870 --> 03:35:05,990
Holy shit.

4259
03:35:06,390 --> 03:35:07,970
I'm literally...

4260
03:35:07,970 --> 03:35:09,110
I'm missing my...

4261
03:35:09,110 --> 03:35:11,650
My sleeps.

4262
03:35:11,990 --> 03:35:13,970
So I need to lock in here.

4263
03:35:19,210 --> 03:35:21,230
He's literally like...

4264
03:35:21,230 --> 03:35:22,650
Dodging all my...

4265
03:35:22,650 --> 03:35:25,430
He dodges all my sleeps every time I try to...

4266
03:35:25,430 --> 03:35:28,570
I shoot the ground, but he's on the other side by the time.

4267
03:35:29,430 --> 03:35:30,870
So I gotta...

4268
03:35:30,870 --> 03:35:32,850
I gotta fucking get better at that.

4269
03:35:33,670 --> 03:35:35,330
This is a really good Black Panther.

4270
03:35:35,990 --> 03:35:38,170
I'm like fucking struggling against him.

4271
03:35:42,910 --> 03:35:43,470
Woo!

4272
03:35:44,270 --> 03:35:44,510
Alright.

4273
03:35:46,010 --> 03:35:46,570
Okay.

4274
03:35:49,190 --> 03:35:50,490
There we go.

4275
03:35:51,590 --> 03:35:53,210
Thank you for the raid again!

4276
03:35:53,350 --> 03:35:54,510
I really appreciate it!

4277
03:35:58,930 --> 03:35:59,610
I literally...

4278
03:36:03,050 --> 03:36:04,170
The sleeps!

4279
03:36:04,630 --> 03:36:07,290
If I don't miss the sleep, it would've been so...

4280
03:36:07,290 --> 03:36:08,030
Oh my god.

4281
03:36:08,110 --> 03:36:09,210
I could shut him down.

4282
03:36:09,210 --> 03:36:10,730
But like...

4283
03:36:10,730 --> 03:36:12,990
He's literally dashing through all of them.

4284
03:36:13,230 --> 03:36:14,030
It's actually crazy.

4285
03:36:14,550 --> 03:36:15,850
He's really good.

4286
03:36:17,010 --> 03:36:19,370
Like, he's actually really good.

4287
03:36:20,370 --> 03:36:21,460
Which is surprising.

4288
03:36:23,950 --> 03:36:25,050
Oh my god.

4289
03:36:25,290 --> 03:36:25,930
This is scary.

4290
03:36:26,050 --> 03:36:27,170
I don't want to waste it too.

4291
03:36:29,870 --> 03:36:32,730
Trying not to waste my heals too much.

4292
03:36:34,610 --> 03:36:35,210
Should we start left?

4293
03:36:35,490 --> 03:36:36,210
Panther to left!

4294
03:36:37,830 --> 03:36:38,510
He's asleep!

4295
03:36:38,670 --> 03:36:38,810
He's asleep!

4296
03:36:39,170 --> 03:36:39,930
He's one!

4297
03:36:41,490 --> 03:36:41,910
He's solo!

4298
03:36:42,050 --> 03:36:42,390
He's one!

4299
03:36:43,130 --> 03:36:45,730
There you go.

4300
03:36:45,870 --> 03:36:46,610
I'm locked in.

4301
03:36:48,590 --> 03:36:49,610
Oh my god.

4302
03:36:49,910 --> 03:36:51,070
I don't have enough leaves!

4303
03:36:51,630 --> 03:36:52,510
Careful, Strange.

4304
03:36:54,770 --> 03:36:56,210
We can heal you.

4305
03:36:56,450 --> 03:36:56,830
Right now.

4306
03:37:02,470 --> 03:37:03,470
Oh my god.

4307
03:37:03,870 --> 03:37:04,430
Please!

4308
03:37:04,430 --> 03:37:04,650
Please!

4309
03:37:05,830 --> 03:37:08,090
I need like...

4310
03:37:10,380 --> 03:37:10,960
He's asleep!

4311
03:37:11,040 --> 03:37:11,300
He's asleep!

4312
03:37:12,920 --> 03:37:13,740
Oh my god.

4313
03:37:13,820 --> 03:37:14,760
See, now I'm hitting it.

4314
03:37:14,880 --> 03:37:15,880
I'm hitting those sleeps!

4315
03:37:17,160 --> 03:37:19,380
But I don't have enough sleeps for everything!

4316
03:37:21,780 --> 03:37:22,440
To your left.

4317
03:37:22,500 --> 03:37:22,840
Top left.

4318
03:37:28,110 --> 03:37:28,550
Asleep.

4319
03:37:28,590 --> 03:37:29,070
Asleep, Magic.

4320
03:37:30,330 --> 03:37:30,830
Magic's low.

4321
03:37:30,950 --> 03:37:31,390
Magic's one.

4322
03:37:33,310 --> 03:37:34,250
I don't have ult yet.

4323
03:37:39,190 --> 03:37:40,290
Oh, Strange half.

4324
03:37:41,290 --> 03:37:42,410
Mantis is low too.

4325
03:37:45,030 --> 03:37:45,850
Oh my god.

4326
03:37:45,870 --> 03:37:46,990
I'm so locked in.

4327
03:37:47,090 --> 03:37:48,390
I told you guys!

4328
03:37:51,170 --> 03:37:53,030
Figuring... I know what he's thinking.

4329
03:37:53,110 --> 03:37:53,690
I'm in his mind.

4330
03:37:53,990 --> 03:37:55,890
I'm in his fucking mind now.

4331
03:37:56,270 --> 03:38:02,770
I'm in his fucking mind now.

4332
03:38:12,790 --> 03:38:14,270
Oh my god.

4333
03:38:14,270 --> 03:38:14,330
Oh my god.

4334
03:38:17,830 --> 03:38:20,490
I don't see anything.

4335
03:38:21,610 --> 03:38:21,950
Nice.

4336
03:38:27,410 --> 03:38:29,130
Oh, be careful guys.

4337
03:38:34,680 --> 03:38:35,820
Alright.

4338
03:38:35,820 --> 03:38:37,560
I told you!

4339
03:38:37,940 --> 03:38:40,160
I'm in his head!

4340
03:38:42,440 --> 03:38:43,920
You should have Magical here.

4341
03:38:45,040 --> 03:38:46,120
And Black Panther ult.

4342
03:38:48,860 --> 03:38:49,460
Help with Strange.

4343
03:38:55,010 --> 03:38:56,530
This is fine.

4344
03:38:59,130 --> 03:38:59,570
Oh, Strange.

4345
03:38:59,890 --> 03:39:00,550
Magic's low.

4346
03:39:09,680 --> 03:39:10,960
Come on.

4347
03:39:11,240 --> 03:39:11,440
Penny.

4348
03:39:11,560 --> 03:39:11,980
Penny one.

4349
03:39:12,100 --> 03:39:12,400
Penny one.

4350
03:39:13,840 --> 03:39:14,300
It's huge.

4351
03:39:14,440 --> 03:39:14,780
It's huge.

4352
03:39:16,100 --> 03:39:16,820
I'm gonna ult.

4353
03:39:16,860 --> 03:39:17,420
I'm ulting this.

4354
03:39:19,060 --> 03:39:20,340
Focus on Magic if we can.

4355
03:39:20,660 --> 03:39:21,200
I just left him.

4356
03:39:21,300 --> 03:39:21,760
Oh, nevermind.

4357
03:39:22,560 --> 03:39:22,880
Help with Strange.

4358
03:39:22,940 --> 03:39:23,360
Help with Strange.

4359
03:39:25,500 --> 03:39:26,840
I don't have heals anymore.

4360
03:39:31,040 --> 03:39:31,400
Nice.

4361
03:39:36,260 --> 03:39:36,620
Careful.

4362
03:39:40,780 --> 03:39:41,360
I slept him.

4363
03:39:41,420 --> 03:39:41,680
I slept him.

4364
03:39:41,720 --> 03:39:42,040
I slept him.

4365
03:39:42,040 --> 03:39:42,660
One.

4366
03:39:42,800 --> 03:39:42,800
One.

4367
03:39:42,880 --> 03:39:42,920
One.

4368
03:39:43,000 --> 03:39:43,540
He's one.

4369
03:39:46,780 --> 03:39:47,260
Wolverine.

4370
03:39:47,320 --> 03:39:47,820
Wolverine half.

4371
03:39:47,940 --> 03:39:48,420
Wolverine low.

4372
03:39:54,310 --> 03:39:55,730
I'm out of position.

4373
03:40:01,890 --> 03:40:03,330
I might be dead here.

4374
03:40:03,650 --> 03:40:04,510
Madness is one.

4375
03:40:10,170 --> 03:40:11,370
If you can heal me Loki.

4376
03:40:12,770 --> 03:40:13,990
We can might be contestant.

4377
03:40:14,430 --> 03:40:15,230
I actually don't know.

4378
03:40:16,770 --> 03:40:17,250
Nevermind.

4379
03:40:18,410 --> 03:40:19,190
Back up.

4380
03:40:24,300 --> 03:40:25,460
Oh my god.

4381
03:40:30,580 --> 03:40:36,680
There's a Wolverine to our left.

4382
03:40:44,880 --> 03:40:46,320
We need to push up soon.

4383
03:40:49,440 --> 03:40:50,940
I don't have any leaves.

4384
03:40:51,800 --> 03:40:52,080
I'm pushing.

4385
03:40:52,200 --> 03:40:52,800
I'm pushing up for her.

4386
03:40:53,240 --> 03:40:53,440
Go.

4387
03:40:53,980 --> 03:40:54,080
Go.

4388
03:40:54,260 --> 03:40:54,260
Go.

4389
03:40:54,420 --> 03:40:54,460
Go.

4390
03:40:56,860 --> 03:40:57,860
They also support ulti.

4391
03:40:57,960 --> 03:40:58,420
Be careful.

4392
03:40:59,120 --> 03:40:59,780
They have Wolverine ult.

4393
03:40:59,860 --> 03:41:00,460
They have Wolverine ult.

4394
03:41:06,170 --> 03:41:07,450
They're gonna have Wolverine ult soon.

4395
03:41:10,410 --> 03:41:10,730
Nice.

4396
03:41:11,670 --> 03:41:12,230
We're even.

4397
03:41:15,290 --> 03:41:15,850
Strange is half.

4398
03:41:15,930 --> 03:41:16,330
Strange is low.

4399
03:41:20,700 --> 03:41:21,020
Nice.

4400
03:41:21,100 --> 03:41:21,460
We're up one.

4401
03:41:21,520 --> 03:41:21,840
We're up one.

4402
03:41:22,040 --> 03:41:22,820
I'm focusing on Strange.

4403
03:41:23,320 --> 03:41:23,920
Strange is half.

4404
03:41:24,820 --> 03:41:25,220
Strange is one.

4405
03:41:25,300 --> 03:41:25,740
Strange is one.

4406
03:41:28,700 --> 03:41:29,280
No more ults.

4407
03:41:29,300 --> 03:41:29,660
No more ults.

4408
03:41:29,660 --> 03:41:30,280
We win this.

4409
03:41:30,640 --> 03:41:31,380
Oh, nevermind.

4410
03:41:32,380 --> 03:41:32,940
I'm on Mantis.

4411
03:41:33,060 --> 03:41:33,500
Mantis low.

4412
03:41:33,640 --> 03:41:35,660
We should fight the spawns.

4413
03:41:38,960 --> 03:41:39,360
Help our Strange.

4414
03:41:39,420 --> 03:41:39,860
Help our Strange.

4415
03:41:40,240 --> 03:41:41,200
I don't have heals anymore.

4416
03:41:43,860 --> 03:41:44,220
Yo.

4417
03:41:44,400 --> 03:41:44,680
Yo.

4418
03:41:45,000 --> 03:41:45,980
I didn't have leaves.

4419
03:41:46,260 --> 03:41:46,280
Sorry.

4420
03:41:49,280 --> 03:41:49,740
No more.

4421
03:41:49,780 --> 03:41:50,220
Can you peek me?

4422
03:41:50,260 --> 03:41:50,620
Second damage.

4423
03:41:53,820 --> 03:41:55,060
They have Wolverine ult still.

4424
03:41:56,340 --> 03:41:57,060
Nice pick.

4425
03:41:57,140 --> 03:41:57,820
That's a huge pick.

4426
03:42:00,460 --> 03:42:01,500
Oh, we're down one.

4427
03:42:01,660 --> 03:42:02,120
We're down one.

4428
03:42:02,280 --> 03:42:02,780
Oh, we're even.

4429
03:42:03,600 --> 03:42:04,640
Wolverine is still looking for ult.

4430
03:42:07,680 --> 03:42:08,220
Left side.

4431
03:42:08,260 --> 03:42:09,020
Left side is Hella.

4432
03:42:10,160 --> 03:42:10,840
Oh, no.

4433
03:42:13,200 --> 03:42:14,620
We can try and stabilize with this.

4434
03:42:14,740 --> 03:42:15,820
Hella is still left.

4435
03:42:16,260 --> 03:42:22,820
I can't peek that.

4436
03:42:24,200 --> 03:42:24,460
She's dead.

4437
03:42:25,380 --> 03:42:25,800
She's dead.

4438
03:42:25,800 --> 03:42:26,500
Oh, shit.

4439
03:42:27,020 --> 03:42:28,900
Oh, magic low.

4440
03:42:29,120 --> 03:42:29,420
Magic low.

4441
03:42:34,280 --> 03:42:35,260
I'm stuck here.

4442
03:42:35,360 --> 03:42:35,820
I might be dead.

4443
03:42:36,260 --> 03:42:36,980
I got Hella, though.

4444
03:42:37,740 --> 03:42:38,060
Get on her.

4445
03:42:38,080 --> 03:42:38,660
Get on her.

4446
03:42:38,700 --> 03:42:39,580
I can't.

4447
03:42:40,680 --> 03:42:41,200
I'm on point.

4448
03:42:44,040 --> 03:42:46,040
I'm on the... Strange just got ult after this.

4449
03:42:50,140 --> 03:42:53,520
Oh, I just got ult, too.

4450
03:42:54,060 --> 03:42:57,140
If you guys can live, I can hop in.

4451
03:43:00,040 --> 03:43:01,140
Oh, shit.

4452
03:43:02,500 --> 03:43:03,080
I don't think so.

4453
03:43:03,260 --> 03:43:04,160
Just give it away.

4454
03:43:08,840 --> 03:43:10,440
I just got ult.

4455
03:43:12,240 --> 03:43:13,020
That sucks.

4456
03:43:13,860 --> 03:43:15,460
If I didn't... Oh, my God.

4457
03:43:15,680 --> 03:43:22,760
I literally... If I could have lived for one second longer, we could have fucking lived there.

4458
03:43:25,600 --> 03:43:26,840
Wait, Wolverine's low.

4459
03:43:27,860 --> 03:43:28,360
Oh, no.

4460
03:43:30,060 --> 03:43:31,020
That sucks.

4461
03:43:34,710 --> 03:43:35,790
That sucks.

4462
03:43:36,050 --> 03:43:39,470
I can save our strength there.

4463
03:43:41,230 --> 03:43:42,070
Go, Penny.

4464
03:43:42,170 --> 03:43:42,610
Go, go, go.

4465
03:43:46,190 --> 03:43:47,470
Oh, my God.

4466
03:43:47,650 --> 03:43:49,870
I can't do anything about it.

4467
03:43:51,410 --> 03:43:58,130
I should have ulted faster if I knew he was gonna... Oh, my God.

4468
03:43:59,530 --> 03:44:00,890
That was unlucky.

4469
03:44:01,670 --> 03:44:03,290
That was a good ult.

4470
03:44:03,670 --> 03:44:03,950
Yeah.

4471
03:44:05,070 --> 03:44:06,410
That was unlucky.

4472
03:44:09,770 --> 03:44:11,290
I ulted...

4473
03:44:11,870 --> 03:44:15,670
I ulted to try and save our Strange, but he... It was too late.

4474
03:44:16,310 --> 03:44:18,230
His kidnap was too far.

4475
03:44:19,430 --> 03:44:21,810
The kidnap was too fucking far.

4476
03:44:26,750 --> 03:44:31,670
Yeah, his kidnapping was too much for us.

4477
03:44:34,110 --> 03:44:36,790
That had ult for the choke point for a while?

4478
03:44:40,270 --> 03:44:41,170
I don't know.

4479
03:44:41,250 --> 03:44:41,850
Did I actually?

4480
03:44:43,150 --> 03:44:43,950
Which choke point?

4481
03:44:44,050 --> 03:44:46,350
Like the... Wait, did I?

4482
03:44:46,490 --> 03:44:47,130
Oh, my God.

4483
03:44:47,190 --> 03:44:47,750
I must have...

4484
03:44:48,100 --> 03:44:49,230
Yeah, I must have tunneled.

4485
03:44:49,870 --> 03:44:51,630
I must have fucking tunneled then.

4486
03:44:53,050 --> 03:44:53,950
I didn't know that.

4487
03:44:54,110 --> 03:44:54,590
I thought I...

4488
03:44:54,590 --> 03:44:59,750
I thought I just got it because the Hella and Magic were pushing me.

4489
03:45:00,510 --> 03:45:01,690
So I was just like, okay.

4490
03:45:04,790 --> 03:45:10,790
Because I had to... I had to fucking fight off the Hella by myself and then the Magic came up.

4491
03:45:11,170 --> 03:45:12,390
Oh, if I...

4492
03:45:12,830 --> 03:45:15,050
Yeah, I didn't realize because I knew I didn't have ult.

4493
03:45:15,050 --> 03:45:16,490
I didn't know the Hella kill gave me ult.

4494
03:45:19,760 --> 03:45:22,760
No, I was getting pushed by Hella, Magic, and Wolverine.

4495
03:45:22,860 --> 03:45:24,620
So I was just like, okay.

4496
03:45:25,280 --> 03:45:26,620
And I like broke down.

4497
03:45:32,800 --> 03:45:34,360
I was just like, alright.

4498
03:45:39,320 --> 03:45:40,860
I literally had like...

4499
03:45:42,040 --> 03:45:47,780
Had like support tunnel vision because I was getting... I was getting fucking ran at.

4500
03:45:51,750 --> 03:45:53,400
I was so scared.

4501
03:45:56,120 --> 03:45:57,160
That's fine.

4502
03:45:57,820 --> 03:45:59,140
I make mistakes.

4503
03:46:04,220 --> 03:46:05,460
It happens.

4504
03:46:07,540 --> 03:46:09,440
I don't know which part is like...

4505
03:46:09,440 --> 03:46:13,600
When you Q with like a GM's replay, the loss is fucking...

4506
03:46:13,600 --> 03:46:14,340
Fuck, man.

4507
03:46:14,660 --> 03:46:15,380
Yeah, but okay.

4508
03:46:15,460 --> 03:46:17,440
I locked... I fixed the sleep problem though.

4509
03:46:17,860 --> 03:46:20,020
I literally fixed the sleep problem.

4510
03:46:20,360 --> 03:46:22,460
I was like, I'm not sleeping, people.

4511
03:46:22,840 --> 03:46:26,340
And then round two, I locked in and I started sleeping people again.

4512
03:46:26,400 --> 03:46:27,240
I was like, there you go.

4513
03:46:27,780 --> 03:46:28,420
There you go.

4514
03:46:28,700 --> 03:46:29,900
I fixed it.

4515
03:46:31,880 --> 03:46:32,920
I did.

4516
03:46:33,020 --> 03:46:34,060
I literally...

4517
03:46:34,060 --> 03:46:37,740
I literally fucking... I shut them down so hard.

4518
03:46:39,800 --> 03:46:41,620
I literally shut them down.

4519
03:46:45,140 --> 03:46:48,680
Trick and Kendrick in the same game.

4520
03:46:53,440 --> 03:46:53,880
True.

4521
03:46:59,810 --> 03:47:00,910
Yeah, but Leah, what are the odds?

4522
03:47:01,470 --> 03:47:02,890
How long have I been streaming anyway?

4523
03:47:03,350 --> 03:47:04,630
Why don't I just put a 30 second ad?

4524
03:47:15,590 --> 03:47:17,470
Why don't I just do it?

4525
03:47:17,810 --> 03:47:18,610
I'm gonna do it.

4526
03:47:19,610 --> 03:47:21,110
30 second ads, guys.

4527
03:47:21,810 --> 03:47:22,810
I'm gonna fucking do it.

4528
03:47:23,550 --> 03:47:25,590
Guys, you know how to avoid ads?

4529
03:47:25,590 --> 03:47:27,390
If you subscribe.

4530
03:47:28,730 --> 03:47:29,930
Do it, coward.

4531
03:47:30,490 --> 03:47:32,110
Thank you for the Twitch Prime.

4532
03:47:32,170 --> 03:47:32,410
Thank you.

4533
03:47:35,430 --> 03:47:36,830
Yeah, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

4534
03:47:36,950 --> 03:47:37,890
Thank you.

4535
03:47:38,290 --> 03:47:39,570
I really appreciate it.

4536
03:47:39,570 --> 03:47:40,530
Thank you so much.

4537
03:47:41,610 --> 03:47:42,350
I did it.

4538
03:47:42,750 --> 03:47:44,410
And then I lose like five...

4539
03:47:44,410 --> 03:47:46,050
I lose like a thousand viewers from that.

4540
03:47:50,470 --> 03:47:52,610
Sorry, I got unsubbed, guys.

4541
03:47:52,950 --> 03:47:54,470
I got unsubbed.

4542
03:47:58,690 --> 03:48:00,830
Oh my god, I finally get a cough map.

4543
03:48:01,050 --> 03:48:01,890
Jesus Christ.

4544
03:48:02,290 --> 03:48:04,210
I feel like I haven't played cough in so long.

4545
03:48:07,030 --> 03:48:08,310
I won't sell out.

4546
03:48:08,490 --> 03:48:09,130
That's right.

4547
03:48:09,450 --> 03:48:12,110
I sell out like once every 20 years.

4548
03:48:12,550 --> 03:48:12,990
Jeff.

4549
03:48:13,230 --> 03:48:15,710
Oh my god, I thought I was gonna fucking have a heart attack.

4550
03:48:20,520 --> 03:48:21,620
I don't even know what that...

4551
03:48:21,620 --> 03:48:24,520
You know, I could put a fucking six minute ad on there.

4552
03:48:24,720 --> 03:48:25,100
You're welcome.

4553
03:48:31,940 --> 03:48:32,360
Alright.

4554
03:48:33,420 --> 03:48:34,400
Oh, Venom.

4555
03:48:35,000 --> 03:48:37,880
I never see Venoms in my games until...

4556
03:48:37,880 --> 03:48:39,640
Well, actually...

4557
03:48:39,640 --> 03:48:41,660
Only Scrap in Rust Kingdom?

4558
03:48:42,160 --> 03:48:43,100
Who's this guy?

4559
03:48:43,820 --> 03:48:44,660
Who's Jumpman?

4560
03:48:49,140 --> 03:48:50,820
I owe people a lot of stuff.

4561
03:48:50,940 --> 03:48:51,880
They gotta be specific.

4562
03:48:52,020 --> 03:48:53,100
Oh, I don't know why I clapped.

4563
03:48:53,200 --> 03:48:55,440
That was reflex, because usually the tank is in front of me.

4564
03:48:57,020 --> 03:48:57,580
Like...

4565
03:48:58,200 --> 03:49:00,860
Usually, I would have a tank in front of me.

4566
03:49:01,020 --> 03:49:02,240
And then, you know...

4567
03:49:02,240 --> 03:49:05,180
My clapping would be very smart.

4568
03:49:05,640 --> 03:49:06,280
But like...

4569
03:49:06,280 --> 03:49:08,100
Where did my tank go?

4570
03:49:08,760 --> 03:49:09,320
What?

4571
03:49:13,260 --> 03:49:14,860
Oh my god.

4572
03:49:22,860 --> 03:49:24,860
Is there a penny on us?

4573
03:49:25,760 --> 03:49:27,950
Oh my god.

4574
03:49:28,050 --> 03:49:28,650
Fuck.

4575
03:49:29,610 --> 03:49:31,050
I'm waking you up.

4576
03:49:31,230 --> 03:49:32,650
I'm waking you up right now.

4577
03:49:35,510 --> 03:49:36,970
Oh my god.

4578
03:49:37,030 --> 03:49:38,090
I'm frozen too.

4579
03:49:39,630 --> 03:49:41,030
Oh my god.

4580
03:49:41,070 --> 03:49:41,690
It's fine.

4581
03:49:41,830 --> 03:49:42,670
We capped it.

4582
03:49:44,030 --> 03:49:45,870
It was a bit late.

4583
03:49:48,030 --> 03:49:49,510
I literally do that with reflex.

4584
03:49:50,090 --> 03:49:50,430
Like...

4585
03:49:50,430 --> 03:49:53,450
Just clap the moment I get to there.

4586
03:49:53,590 --> 03:49:55,050
Because usually...

4587
03:49:55,050 --> 03:49:56,730
There would be like 20...

4588
03:49:56,730 --> 03:49:59,430
There would be like...

4589
03:49:59,430 --> 03:50:00,950
You know, my tank is in front of me.

4590
03:50:01,170 --> 03:50:03,990
So it would make sense for me to start clapping.

4591
03:50:04,410 --> 03:50:05,710
So I can do like...

4592
03:50:05,710 --> 03:50:07,770
Absolutely crazy heals.

4593
03:50:08,250 --> 03:50:09,370
So I was just like...

4594
03:50:09,370 --> 03:50:10,450
Where did they go?

4595
03:50:11,290 --> 03:50:13,630
Where did my tanks go?

4596
03:50:14,130 --> 03:50:14,730
Where are they?

4597
03:50:16,030 --> 03:50:16,950
Where are they?

4598
03:50:17,110 --> 03:50:19,350
Where did they go?

4599
03:50:19,810 --> 03:50:21,230
We can do Mantis ult first.

4600
03:50:22,930 --> 03:50:23,630
I'm dead.

4601
03:50:24,420 --> 03:50:25,110
Alright.

4602
03:50:28,670 --> 03:50:31,430
Is this...

4603
03:50:32,280 --> 03:50:33,770
Is this Numbuh?

4604
03:50:34,470 --> 03:50:35,590
I...

4605
03:50:35,590 --> 03:50:36,530
Alright.

4606
03:50:37,210 --> 03:50:39,810
I don't know how...

4607
03:50:39,810 --> 03:50:42,010
I don't know how they die.

4608
03:50:44,190 --> 03:50:45,570
Alright.

4609
03:50:47,230 --> 03:50:49,030
That was strange as hell.

4610
03:50:54,290 --> 03:50:56,130
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more.

4611
03:50:56,550 --> 03:50:57,310
Oh my god.

4612
03:50:57,570 --> 03:50:58,670
Oh, Penny ult, Penny ult.

4613
03:51:01,070 --> 03:51:01,850
Alright, nice.

4614
03:51:03,330 --> 03:51:05,010
We did it, everybody.

4615
03:51:06,750 --> 03:51:08,030
Strange as hell right now.

4616
03:51:18,530 --> 03:51:19,330
I'll try...

4617
03:51:20,430 --> 03:51:21,970
If he flies up in the air.

4618
03:51:22,270 --> 03:51:22,690
I don't know.

4619
03:51:27,310 --> 03:51:28,150
If he...

4620
03:51:28,150 --> 03:51:29,970
He stays alive if it's so easy.

4621
03:51:35,710 --> 03:51:37,010
Just CC him.

4622
03:51:38,250 --> 03:51:39,410
Oh, I'm dead, I'm dead.

4623
03:51:39,570 --> 03:51:40,590
There's a magic on me.

4624
03:51:42,670 --> 03:51:44,510
There's a magic still on me.

4625
03:51:47,130 --> 03:51:48,370
Please, magic's one.

4626
03:51:50,150 --> 03:51:50,670
Please.

4627
03:51:53,070 --> 03:51:54,990
You have no heals, you have no heals.

4628
03:51:55,770 --> 03:51:57,630
Just get health packs if you can.

4629
03:51:58,730 --> 03:51:59,950
Oh my god.

4630
03:52:02,370 --> 03:52:04,610
Oh my god, please, get him.

4631
03:52:13,570 --> 03:52:15,610
Oh my god, they're all crying.

4632
03:52:15,930 --> 03:52:16,810
Oh, Penny off the map.

4633
03:52:24,310 --> 03:52:26,370
No more is low, Manor's half.

4634
03:52:27,030 --> 03:52:28,270
No more, no more.

4635
03:52:29,090 --> 03:52:29,550
Manor.

4636
03:52:30,930 --> 03:52:33,010
You can get magic, push magic if you can.

4637
03:52:34,270 --> 03:52:35,010
Magic's half.

4638
03:52:37,730 --> 03:52:38,710
Magic's one, magic's one.

4639
03:52:40,610 --> 03:52:42,170
Spider, Penny's low, Penny half.

4640
03:52:48,330 --> 03:52:49,430
Magic's one, magic's one.

4641
03:52:52,370 --> 03:52:53,850
Luna, Luna, Luna, focus Luna.

4642
03:52:56,510 --> 03:52:57,230
Bro.

4643
03:52:58,950 --> 03:53:00,390
I just saw him pull.

4644
03:53:00,830 --> 03:53:02,270
That poor Penny.

4645
03:53:03,010 --> 03:53:07,510
I swear, we lost that because he did that pull.

4646
03:53:08,090 --> 03:53:09,010
I swear to god.

4647
03:53:14,870 --> 03:53:17,650
They should have both tank ults here.

4648
03:53:21,650 --> 03:53:22,370
They should.

4649
03:53:27,510 --> 03:53:28,550
Still has...

4650
03:53:28,550 --> 03:53:29,090
Alright.

4651
03:53:29,750 --> 03:53:31,170
You can ult first, Mantis.

4652
03:53:34,370 --> 03:53:36,650
Alright, this still has four ults.

4653
03:53:36,930 --> 03:53:38,810
Woah, this is gonna be...

4654
03:53:38,810 --> 03:53:41,630
This is gonna be something, that's for sure.

4655
03:53:43,470 --> 03:53:44,210
How did that work?

4656
03:53:44,330 --> 03:53:45,410
I don't...

4657
03:53:46,630 --> 03:53:47,770
I don't fucking...

4658
03:53:49,350 --> 03:53:49,870
Damn.

4659
03:53:52,650 --> 03:53:53,170
Damn.

4660
03:53:53,770 --> 03:53:55,070
Venom and Spiderman.

4661
03:53:55,870 --> 03:53:56,390
Venom.

4662
03:53:59,030 --> 03:54:00,110
Get off the bed.

4663
03:54:00,210 --> 03:54:01,650
That guy's like, get off the bed.

4664
03:54:01,910 --> 03:54:02,530
To me.

4665
03:54:02,990 --> 03:54:04,670
And he's like, alright, there we go.

4666
03:54:05,110 --> 03:54:06,470
That's what we wanted.

4667
03:54:06,830 --> 03:54:07,710
Right there.

4668
03:54:11,330 --> 03:54:13,210
That was like a fucking hell, man.

4669
03:54:13,830 --> 03:54:14,270
Right there.

4670
03:54:18,090 --> 03:54:19,090
Oh my god.

4671
03:54:19,090 --> 03:54:21,210
Oh my god.

4672
03:54:21,330 --> 03:54:23,810
Okay, I don't think we should use anything here.

4673
03:54:26,550 --> 03:54:27,310
I don't...

4674
03:54:28,650 --> 03:54:32,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4675
03:54:32,770 --> 03:54:34,730
No, Mantis, they still have strange ult.

4676
03:54:34,890 --> 03:54:36,090
I can try and save bubble for them.

4677
03:54:39,950 --> 03:54:42,450
That was a...

4678
03:54:42,450 --> 03:54:43,610
Oh my god, Mantis, please.

4679
03:54:44,230 --> 03:54:45,250
Please, Mantis.

4680
03:54:45,390 --> 03:54:47,310
You are scaring me right now.

4681
03:54:47,610 --> 03:54:48,490
Can you top me off, Mantis?

4682
03:54:48,570 --> 03:54:49,250
I'm behind you.

4683
03:54:52,830 --> 03:54:53,790
I'm ulting it.

4684
03:54:55,430 --> 03:54:57,150
I'm gonna try and get the mines here.

4685
03:54:59,650 --> 03:55:01,150
I didn't say try!

4686
03:55:03,970 --> 03:55:05,850
Oh my god.

4687
03:55:11,190 --> 03:55:12,870
That's a lot of damage.

4688
03:55:14,590 --> 03:55:16,650
Oh, there's a magic on me.

4689
03:55:20,150 --> 03:55:22,290
If you win this, you should be even.

4690
03:55:23,150 --> 03:55:24,210
Because we killed three.

4691
03:55:27,050 --> 03:55:27,750
Our Mantis is back.

4692
03:55:29,450 --> 03:55:31,670
Yeah, they used both supports.

4693
03:55:35,610 --> 03:55:37,070
Mantis should be 50 to next ult.

4694
03:55:47,590 --> 03:55:49,190
Oh, they're pushing us.

4695
03:55:57,430 --> 03:55:58,770
They're gonna strange ult after that.

4696
03:56:01,770 --> 03:56:02,810
He's looking for it.

4697
03:56:02,810 --> 03:56:04,810
He's afk.

4698
03:56:09,750 --> 03:56:11,130
There's a penny to our left.

4699
03:56:11,190 --> 03:56:12,150
There's a penny frozen to our left.

4700
03:56:12,290 --> 03:56:12,790
Can you peek me?

4701
03:56:14,830 --> 03:56:16,250
Mantis, Mantis, look at me.

4702
03:56:19,710 --> 03:56:21,450
Oh, I'm ulting this.

4703
03:56:23,710 --> 03:56:24,610
Fight next to me.

4704
03:56:28,090 --> 03:56:29,450
Oh, that's fine.

4705
03:56:29,950 --> 03:56:30,970
You're so healthy.

4706
03:56:31,370 --> 03:56:33,110
Oh, not you though.

4707
03:56:33,110 --> 03:56:34,510
Not you.

4708
03:56:35,070 --> 03:56:37,550
Some of you will be healthy and some of you...

4709
03:56:37,550 --> 03:56:39,130
Oh my god.

4710
03:56:41,410 --> 03:56:42,510
I think we should just die.

4711
03:56:42,590 --> 03:56:43,110
I'm holding a can.

4712
03:56:50,610 --> 03:56:51,510
I'm sorry.

4713
03:56:51,650 --> 03:56:53,370
I had to pick one or the other.

4714
03:56:53,850 --> 03:56:55,870
You guys were so split up.

4715
03:56:56,650 --> 03:56:58,770
What else am I gonna do there?

4716
03:57:06,640 --> 03:57:08,140
We can walk all the way around.

4717
03:57:09,440 --> 03:57:11,380
Mantis behind us, Mantis behind us.

4718
03:57:11,820 --> 03:57:12,580
I need help.

4719
03:57:13,320 --> 03:57:25,200
Oh, that was last fight.

4720
03:57:26,440 --> 03:57:28,200
That was last fight.

4721
03:57:32,980 --> 03:57:34,680
We should win next fight.

4722
03:57:34,680 --> 03:57:35,640
They're gonna have to go.

4723
03:57:40,280 --> 03:57:44,120
I need... I need somebody to help me.

4724
03:57:51,460 --> 03:57:52,500
It's okay.

4725
03:57:53,220 --> 03:57:53,820
No help.

4726
03:57:54,320 --> 03:57:54,860
No help.

4727
03:57:56,260 --> 03:57:57,000
No help.

4728
03:57:59,460 --> 03:58:00,520
It's okay.

4729
03:58:00,760 --> 03:58:01,680
I don't need help.

4730
03:58:01,940 --> 03:58:02,620
It's okay.

4731
03:58:03,160 --> 03:58:04,400
I don't need help.

4732
03:58:07,560 --> 03:58:08,780
No help.

4733
03:58:12,380 --> 03:58:19,800
I just need somebody to peel magic for me and then I'll be so safe.

4734
03:58:20,460 --> 03:58:21,540
I'll be so...

4735
03:58:21,540 --> 03:58:23,680
Guys, it's that easy.

4736
03:58:24,820 --> 03:58:27,860
If you peel the magic, I'd be...

4737
03:58:27,860 --> 03:58:29,620
I'd be like...

4738
03:58:29,620 --> 03:58:30,240
Yay!

4739
03:58:30,680 --> 03:58:31,420
Yippee!

4740
03:58:34,720 --> 03:58:36,360
I'd be like, yay!

4741
03:58:41,000 --> 03:58:42,860
I feel like you never have help as a heal...

4742
03:58:42,860 --> 03:58:43,600
That's what I'm saying!

4743
03:58:43,720 --> 03:58:45,780
Why do you think the quick play supports help each other?

4744
03:58:46,520 --> 03:58:46,960
Like...

4745
03:58:46,960 --> 03:58:47,060
Like,

4746
03:58:51,060 --> 03:58:52,980
that's why I was so mad!

4747
03:58:53,900 --> 03:58:57,660
Because I'm like, why do quick play supports actually help?

4748
03:59:02,020 --> 03:59:03,880
Why don't I get that?

4749
03:59:05,380 --> 03:59:06,380
I'm an eternity!

4750
03:59:06,680 --> 03:59:08,100
Not even tourney, I'm a GM one.

4751
03:59:08,220 --> 03:59:09,220
Sorry, I forgot.

4752
03:59:09,500 --> 03:59:11,160
I'm not there anymore.

4753
03:59:12,920 --> 03:59:13,920
Help her, Mantis.

4754
03:59:14,620 --> 03:59:15,620
I have a magic on me.

4755
03:59:15,780 --> 03:59:16,300
She's frozen.

4756
03:59:27,360 --> 03:59:27,860
Penny's low!

4757
03:59:28,000 --> 03:59:28,360
Penny's low!

4758
03:59:32,600 --> 03:59:33,200
Penny's half.

4759
03:59:33,300 --> 03:59:33,900
Penny's low again.

4760
03:59:34,040 --> 03:59:34,400
Penny's half.

4761
03:59:34,600 --> 03:59:34,960
Penny's one.

4762
03:59:36,180 --> 03:59:37,840
Please, she's actually one.

4763
03:59:38,380 --> 03:59:39,120
Can we try to get Luna?

4764
03:59:39,960 --> 03:59:40,600
Luna's low.

4765
03:59:42,740 --> 03:59:43,720
Luna's with her Venom.

4766
03:59:51,620 --> 03:59:52,780
Oh my god.

4767
03:59:54,120 --> 03:59:55,440
Thank you for the raid!

4768
03:59:55,560 --> 03:59:56,560
Thank you, thank you!

4769
03:59:56,660 --> 03:59:59,460
For those who don't know me, my name's Zoe, but I usually stream on YouTube.

4770
03:59:59,640 --> 04:00:01,960
But I'm here because I'm...

4771
04:00:02,940 --> 04:00:04,760
Just play all around me.

4772
04:00:05,500 --> 04:00:07,160
Oh, please play around me.

4773
04:00:08,780 --> 04:00:09,820
I dropped down!

4774
04:00:09,960 --> 04:00:10,620
He broke the platform.

4775
04:00:14,920 --> 04:00:15,680
I've frozen!

4776
04:00:15,820 --> 04:00:16,000
I've frozen!

4777
04:00:16,100 --> 04:00:16,360
I've frozen!

4778
04:00:19,260 --> 04:00:22,620
Oh my god, I can't save you all!

4779
04:00:25,420 --> 04:00:26,360
It's fine.

4780
04:00:29,820 --> 04:00:31,800
Yeah, I'll save it for Strangelove.

4781
04:00:39,260 --> 04:00:42,260
I just didn't know we were... I saw the magic and I fucking panicked.

4782
04:00:44,380 --> 04:00:45,960
So I put on the Spiderman first.

4783
04:00:51,850 --> 04:00:55,790
After dying to the magic so many times because I have no peel...

4784
04:00:56,170 --> 04:00:58,810
Of course I have PTSD from that shit.

4785
04:01:00,010 --> 04:01:00,490
Like...

4786
04:01:00,490 --> 04:01:02,330
Magic behind me, she's frozen again.

4787
04:01:05,970 --> 04:01:06,890
We're... we're up.

4788
04:01:07,930 --> 04:01:08,770
We're up two.

4789
04:01:11,630 --> 04:01:13,970
We're up here.

4790
04:01:19,060 --> 04:01:19,740
We're...

4791
04:01:21,880 --> 04:01:23,580
I froze Penny.

4792
04:01:30,340 --> 04:01:31,800
Nice, that's huge.

4793
04:01:35,100 --> 04:01:36,260
Magic, magic, magic!

4794
04:01:37,160 --> 04:01:38,060
Magic blow!

4795
04:01:41,380 --> 04:01:42,880
I have ult for a change.

4796
04:01:48,680 --> 04:01:50,120
Big stagger on them, I guess.

4797
04:01:53,520 --> 04:01:54,000
Alright.

4798
04:01:54,220 --> 04:01:56,600
Oh my god, that magic really fucking...

4799
04:01:56,600 --> 04:01:57,180
That's what I mean!

4800
04:01:57,300 --> 04:01:58,500
This is the only help I get!

4801
04:01:59,100 --> 04:02:00,340
Where's my Mantis?

4802
04:02:02,360 --> 04:02:06,500
That's literally the only help I get from my team.

4803
04:02:06,720 --> 04:02:07,660
I just...

4804
04:02:07,660 --> 04:02:10,440
I just have to... I have to... I freeze.

4805
04:02:10,700 --> 04:02:11,540
I freeze them.

4806
04:02:18,580 --> 04:02:19,580
Someone help our stream.

4807
04:02:26,250 --> 04:02:27,910
Oh, thanks, we can't heal you there.

4808
04:02:28,170 --> 04:02:30,150
I'm falling back, I'm falling back.

4809
04:02:31,210 --> 04:02:32,010
That's Mantis ult.

4810
04:02:33,910 --> 04:02:35,410
That's a huge ult, that's a huge ult!

4811
04:02:35,790 --> 04:02:37,010
Yeah, we can't fucking...

4812
04:02:37,010 --> 04:02:37,530
Alright, alright, alright.

4813
04:02:39,930 --> 04:02:41,650
The magic's on me, I'm not using ult here.

4814
04:02:41,850 --> 04:02:42,290
I'll die.

4815
04:02:43,510 --> 04:02:44,650
I got you, you bubble.

4816
04:02:45,530 --> 04:02:46,330
Oh, I'm dead though.

4817
04:02:46,930 --> 04:02:48,210
Alright, we got... we got...

4818
04:02:48,210 --> 04:02:48,610
Yeah.

4819
04:02:57,270 --> 04:02:57,810
Wait.

4820
04:02:57,890 --> 04:02:59,090
Wait, why did you swap off...

4821
04:02:59,090 --> 04:03:00,870
Why did you swap off Mantis?

4822
04:03:05,860 --> 04:03:07,580
Alright, here we go.

4823
04:03:07,880 --> 04:03:10,020
I either die without using my ult...

4824
04:03:10,020 --> 04:03:10,940
Or I win.

4825
04:03:11,580 --> 04:03:12,540
There's no in-between.

4826
04:03:13,500 --> 04:03:15,540
There's actual no in-between.

4827
04:03:19,400 --> 04:03:20,440
Which way are we going?

4828
04:03:21,720 --> 04:03:23,160
We're split up, we're split up.

4829
04:03:25,240 --> 04:03:26,360
Fucking that shit down.

4830
04:03:27,800 --> 04:03:28,620
They're portaling?

4831
04:03:29,440 --> 04:03:30,280
He's gonna ult.

4832
04:03:30,920 --> 04:03:31,520
Where are you guys?

4833
04:03:32,300 --> 04:03:33,120
I'm on the right.

4834
04:03:34,040 --> 04:03:34,660
This portal looks terrible.

4835
04:03:37,900 --> 04:03:38,340
Please,

4836
04:03:43,090 --> 04:03:44,610
fight Yana all you need to if you're low.

4837
04:03:46,550 --> 04:03:47,550
Oh, why did our team...

4838
04:03:47,550 --> 04:03:48,530
No more purple, no more purple.

4839
04:03:49,490 --> 04:03:51,210
Why did our team BS?

4840
04:03:52,130 --> 04:03:52,570
Please!

4841
04:03:55,450 --> 04:03:58,770
I did everything I'm supposed to do!

4842
04:03:59,910 --> 04:04:01,490
I didn't do this right!

4843
04:04:03,380 --> 04:04:04,680
Oh my god!

4844
04:04:05,140 --> 04:04:05,540
No!

4845
04:04:06,900 --> 04:04:08,880
Oh my god!

4846
04:04:12,580 --> 04:04:13,680
Who's through?

4847
04:04:20,060 --> 04:04:20,720
Who's through?

4848
04:04:24,040 --> 04:04:26,120
Who did he save through?

4849
04:04:28,380 --> 04:04:30,280
I didn't even hear when he said that through.

4850
04:04:42,730 --> 04:04:43,770
Was it me?

4851
04:04:51,030 --> 04:04:52,330
I was literally told!

4852
04:04:54,970 --> 04:04:57,210
I was told to hold ult!

4853
04:05:06,680 --> 04:05:07,600
I literally...

4854
04:05:07,600 --> 04:05:11,430
What the fuck you...

4855
04:05:11,430 --> 04:05:14,190
He said I threw because I held ult...

4856
04:05:14,190 --> 04:05:15,210
Don't tell me to ult!

4857
04:05:20,480 --> 04:05:22,140
I was getting yelled at for...

4858
04:05:22,140 --> 04:05:25,520
I was getting yelled at for ulting against magic.

4859
04:05:25,520 --> 04:05:27,420
Because you're like, save your ult through.

4860
04:05:27,900 --> 04:05:29,000
Save your ult through.

4861
04:05:29,180 --> 04:05:30,660
Stop ulting against magic.

4862
04:05:32,680 --> 04:05:36,480
And I was like, okay, I'll fucking hold my ult against strange.

4863
04:05:44,520 --> 04:05:45,500
Like, what?

4864
04:05:46,360 --> 04:05:50,080
I literally had to defend myself against magic...

4865
04:05:50,080 --> 04:05:51,260
Every time.

4866
04:05:51,380 --> 04:05:52,260
By freezing her.

4867
04:05:52,520 --> 04:05:54,640
And my match was never with me.

4868
04:05:55,300 --> 04:05:55,900
Like...

4869
04:05:59,580 --> 04:06:01,120
If only they helped.

4870
04:06:01,340 --> 04:06:03,380
If only they helped me against the magic.

4871
04:06:03,820 --> 04:06:07,660
Then I wouldn't fucking have to always deal with the magic myself.

4872
04:06:11,590 --> 04:06:12,890
Yeah, it's like...

4873
04:06:12,890 --> 04:06:15,270
You didn't save your ult.

4874
04:06:15,330 --> 04:06:17,410
They're like, alright, magic's on me.

4875
04:06:17,490 --> 04:06:18,870
Fucking help me, I'm holding my ult.

4876
04:06:22,150 --> 04:06:23,190
They're like...

4877
04:06:23,190 --> 04:06:25,910
Why are you ulting against fucking magic?

4878
04:06:26,070 --> 04:06:28,350
I'm like, okay, I'll stop ulting against magic.

4879
04:06:41,480 --> 04:06:42,440
That's crazy.

4880
04:06:42,700 --> 04:06:44,520
Yeah, our Spiderman said I threw.

4881
04:06:45,540 --> 04:06:49,180
Because they were yelling at me for not using my ult against strange.

4882
04:06:49,900 --> 04:06:54,460
Because I basically used my defensive against the first person that aggressed ult me.

4883
04:06:54,780 --> 04:06:57,640
And then they're like, stop using your ult against magic.

4884
04:06:57,740 --> 04:06:58,600
So I was like, okay.

4885
04:06:59,180 --> 04:07:02,860
And then they're like, why'd you threw by holding your ult against magic?

4886
04:07:03,020 --> 04:07:04,320
And I'm like, oh...

4887
04:07:05,120 --> 04:07:06,060
Fuck you.

4888
04:07:06,060 --> 04:07:06,240
That's so...

4889
04:07:07,800 --> 04:07:09,140
That's so bravo.

4890
04:07:09,300 --> 04:07:11,980
Thank you for the raid.

4891
04:07:12,120 --> 04:07:13,000
Thank you.

4892
04:07:18,900 --> 04:07:19,980
Hello, everybody.

4893
04:07:20,860 --> 04:07:22,080
My name is Doki Bird.

4894
04:07:22,240 --> 04:07:24,060
But I usually stream on...

4895
04:07:25,400 --> 04:07:27,080
I usually stream on...

4896
04:07:27,080 --> 04:07:29,860
I haven't found a good tank player to fucking kidnap yet.

4897
04:07:30,640 --> 04:07:33,580
It's so hard to find good tank players to kidnap.

4898
04:07:36,160 --> 04:07:37,820
I'm not... I'm never trusting...

4899
04:07:37,820 --> 04:07:39,000
I should've trusted my intuition.

4900
04:07:39,240 --> 04:07:42,300
I wanted to ult against that magic, but I didn't want to get yelled at again.

4901
04:07:42,820 --> 04:07:43,180
So...

4902
04:07:43,180 --> 04:07:45,580
That's why I didn't... I didn't want to...

4903
04:07:45,580 --> 04:07:47,380
I was worried I was going to get yelled at again.

4904
04:07:47,440 --> 04:07:48,960
So I didn't ult against that magic.

4905
04:07:51,020 --> 04:07:52,160
There's a Spiderman on me?

4906
04:07:52,820 --> 04:07:53,480
Yeah, he's up.

4907
04:07:55,940 --> 04:07:57,060
There's more than one up top.

4908
04:07:57,760 --> 04:07:58,580
Where you're going.

4909
04:08:00,420 --> 04:08:01,440
That's why I was like, oh.

4910
04:08:01,580 --> 04:08:02,520
I don't know what to do.

4911
04:08:04,880 --> 04:08:06,460
I'm just going to trust my intuition.

4912
04:08:06,860 --> 04:08:09,260
I'm not going to let people control where I ult.

4913
04:08:09,380 --> 04:08:10,200
There's another Spiderman again.

4914
04:08:11,040 --> 04:08:11,480
He's frozen.

4915
04:08:12,180 --> 04:08:13,560
Both supports are on point.

4916
04:08:13,900 --> 04:08:14,400
He's low.

4917
04:08:21,560 --> 04:08:22,780
Spiderman's behind us again.

4918
04:08:26,950 --> 04:08:27,950
Oh my god.

4919
04:08:28,870 --> 04:08:30,850
I'll just come hold your hand or whatever you're trying to do.

4920
04:08:30,950 --> 04:08:31,930
Spiderman's behind again.

4921
04:08:35,230 --> 04:08:36,290
Oh my god, please.

4922
04:08:36,570 --> 04:08:37,230
I can't.

4923
04:08:39,790 --> 04:08:41,590
Spiderman's distracting us.

4924
04:08:47,090 --> 04:08:47,570
Clap.

4925
04:08:47,970 --> 04:08:48,450
Clap.

4926
04:08:48,850 --> 04:08:49,090
Clap.

4927
04:08:49,450 --> 04:08:50,970
I'm just using my clap for DPS.

4928
04:08:51,530 --> 04:08:51,770
Clap.

4929
04:08:52,170 --> 04:08:52,370
Clap.

4930
04:08:52,550 --> 04:08:53,090
Oh, nice.

4931
04:08:56,930 --> 04:08:58,710
And you can ult whenever.

4932
04:09:01,490 --> 04:09:02,830
Oh, to your right.

4933
04:09:02,990 --> 04:09:03,650
There's a Strange.

4934
04:09:04,050 --> 04:09:04,650
Strange is half.

4935
04:09:04,730 --> 04:09:05,110
Strange is low.

4936
04:09:07,370 --> 04:09:09,390
Spiderman's behind us again.

4937
04:09:13,830 --> 04:09:14,970
Oh my god.

4938
04:09:15,030 --> 04:09:15,670
There's so many.

4939
04:09:17,970 --> 04:09:18,530
Please.

4940
04:09:19,110 --> 04:09:19,690
Ah!

4941
04:09:20,710 --> 04:09:21,330
I'm ulting this.

4942
04:09:24,090 --> 04:09:24,690
Please.

4943
04:09:25,010 --> 04:09:26,390
Kill anybody.

4944
04:09:29,190 --> 04:09:30,610
Ah, guess not.

4945
04:09:30,670 --> 04:09:31,510
Oh shit, nice.

4946
04:09:32,770 --> 04:09:34,590
Oh, there's a Spiderman still behind us.

4947
04:09:37,170 --> 04:09:38,310
Strange walking up to me.

4948
04:09:38,390 --> 04:09:39,350
I'm gonna die here.

4949
04:09:42,570 --> 04:09:43,210
There's...

4950
04:09:48,210 --> 04:09:53,770
We need somebody to peel for Spiderman because our Mantis is getting distracted by him.

4951
04:09:58,520 --> 04:09:59,340
Oh my god.

4952
04:10:00,520 --> 04:10:01,780
Oh my god.

4953
04:10:02,400 --> 04:10:03,040
Fucking...

4954
04:10:03,040 --> 04:10:04,280
Strange, please!

4955
04:10:04,540 --> 04:10:05,860
I can't heal you forever!

4956
04:10:05,860 --> 04:10:08,260
You get a weapon!

4957
04:10:08,780 --> 04:10:09,840
Oh, skip.

4958
04:10:12,160 --> 04:10:13,320
That's cool.

4959
04:10:17,840 --> 04:10:19,360
This is...

4960
04:10:19,360 --> 04:10:21,040
Spiderman behind us again.

4961
04:10:22,220 --> 04:10:22,760
He's one.

4962
04:10:25,500 --> 04:10:25,880
Please.

4963
04:10:28,180 --> 04:10:30,080
I can't keep you up forever.

4964
04:10:30,640 --> 04:10:31,320
I'm dead here.

4965
04:10:32,120 --> 04:10:32,920
I can't.

4966
04:10:33,640 --> 04:10:35,420
You're falling apart.

4967
04:10:37,580 --> 04:10:42,180
No, I don't do the Luna tech because it's bugged.

4968
04:10:42,360 --> 04:10:48,760
People keep thinking it's a really good tech because it looks cool but it loses games more than it wins games.

4969
04:10:49,100 --> 04:10:53,260
I saw a streamer do it so I'm pretty sure it's a good tech but it's not.

4970
04:10:53,920 --> 04:10:55,460
There's a Spiderman behind again.

4971
04:11:05,580 --> 04:11:06,840
What's the tech?

4972
04:11:10,200 --> 04:11:10,900
Basically...

4973
04:11:13,500 --> 04:11:14,200
Basically...

4974
04:11:17,800 --> 04:11:25,160
You can damage and heal over and over but it can bug out to the point where...

4975
04:11:25,160 --> 04:11:25,980
I'm on their Mantis.

4976
04:11:26,610 --> 04:11:26,960
What?

4977
04:11:30,460 --> 04:11:31,160
What?

4978
04:11:31,160 --> 04:11:31,440
What?

4979
04:11:31,760 --> 04:11:33,240
Why didn't that hit?

4980
04:11:33,980 --> 04:11:35,140
Was it because I was in the air?

4981
04:11:36,140 --> 04:11:38,460
It like pulled up on my screen.

4982
04:11:40,820 --> 04:11:41,860
Alright, goodbye.

4983
04:11:47,140 --> 04:11:47,520
Alright.

4984
04:11:48,300 --> 04:11:49,100
Here we go.

4985
04:11:52,500 --> 04:11:54,520
There's a Spiderman on our Mantis.

4986
04:12:01,160 --> 04:12:02,780
He's gonna auto-mote us.

4987
04:12:06,980 --> 04:12:08,660
Can it though?

4988
04:12:08,800 --> 04:12:10,060
Can it really die?

4989
04:12:12,080 --> 04:12:13,160
Can he literally...

4990
04:12:14,240 --> 04:12:15,520
Die, please!

4991
04:12:17,300 --> 04:12:19,460
Oh my god!

4992
04:12:20,240 --> 04:12:22,360
Someone just killed a Spiderman!

4993
04:12:25,680 --> 04:12:28,700
It actually heals less than it damages too.

4994
04:12:28,700 --> 04:12:30,060
If you guys don't know that.

4995
04:12:30,760 --> 04:12:33,660
The Luna tech, it heals less than it damages.

4996
04:12:36,380 --> 04:12:39,900
Because people think it does more heals than damage but it actually doesn't.

4997
04:12:40,220 --> 04:12:43,900
So people can actually kill through the Luna ult because of that tech.

4998
04:12:44,280 --> 04:12:46,480
And also it can bug out and stay on damage.

4999
04:12:46,820 --> 04:12:48,140
So there's way too much risk.

5000
04:12:48,820 --> 04:12:53,400
There's way too much risk with it than their actual benefits.

5001
04:12:53,760 --> 04:13:00,520
Because I've lost two games when when the tech was first came out, I actually lost two games from it.

5002
04:13:02,520 --> 04:13:03,760
That's why I don't do it anymore.

5003
04:13:03,880 --> 04:13:05,140
I did it for like two days.

5004
04:13:05,500 --> 04:13:07,980
The first day, it was great.

5005
04:13:08,260 --> 04:13:08,820
It felt great.

5006
04:13:08,960 --> 04:13:11,260
And then the second day I realized it was not so great.

5007
04:13:11,900 --> 04:13:13,420
It looks cool though.

5008
04:13:13,720 --> 04:13:15,400
Yeah, it looks so cool.

5009
04:13:22,740 --> 04:13:24,860
Yeah, that happens.

5010
04:13:24,980 --> 04:13:25,820
The Namor's up top.

5011
04:13:26,720 --> 04:13:27,880
Kill the Namor bullshit.

5012
04:13:28,480 --> 04:13:29,540
Their Namor's half.

5013
04:13:29,840 --> 04:13:31,040
I'm about to try and shit at him.

5014
04:13:33,800 --> 04:13:35,980
I'm gonna look here but you're not gonna be able to shoot this ult.

5015
04:13:39,060 --> 04:13:41,040
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

5016
04:13:42,260 --> 04:13:44,860
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

5017
04:13:44,860 --> 04:13:46,860
Alright, I don't know why.

5018
04:13:50,660 --> 04:13:52,500
I'm so dead, I'm so dead.

5019
04:14:01,130 --> 04:14:03,070
We have one fight here.

5020
04:14:04,430 --> 04:14:06,030
We have one fight, that's fine.

5021
04:14:06,610 --> 04:14:07,850
Spiderman's ruined actually.

5022
04:14:08,310 --> 04:14:09,370
He's trying to pull somebody off.

5023
04:14:10,510 --> 04:14:10,990
Okay.

5024
04:14:11,750 --> 04:14:12,230
Nice.

5025
04:14:17,320 --> 04:14:18,320
We got him.

5026
04:14:19,180 --> 04:14:21,440
I stood in the door cause I knew I would not survive.

5027
04:14:22,220 --> 04:14:24,620
I knew damn well I was not gonna survive that.

5028
04:14:28,600 --> 04:14:30,800
Put on the storm just cause like he has to.

5029
04:14:34,580 --> 04:14:35,540
Oh no.

5030
04:14:36,220 --> 04:14:37,840
There's a strange right behind us.

5031
04:14:40,840 --> 04:14:41,440
Fire!

5032
04:14:49,920 --> 04:14:51,440
I'm gonna die to the Spiderman.

5033
04:15:00,500 --> 04:15:02,500
Oh my god.

5034
04:15:05,120 --> 04:15:06,420
I don't understand.

5035
04:15:06,580 --> 04:15:08,100
Nobody peels for him.

5036
04:15:08,120 --> 04:15:08,940
I don't understand.

5037
04:15:10,120 --> 04:15:14,040
We called out the Spiderman every time.

5038
04:15:14,040 --> 04:15:15,480
Everybody just ignores him.

5039
04:15:15,860 --> 04:15:17,040
I don't understand.

5040
04:15:17,860 --> 04:15:20,340
Why nobody looks at him.

5041
04:15:24,710 --> 04:15:29,890
Like, we look at him and then we don't put the...

5042
04:15:29,890 --> 04:15:31,270
Oh my god, this is actually crazy.

5043
04:15:31,510 --> 04:15:32,770
No one looks at the Spiderman.

5044
04:15:33,810 --> 04:15:35,910
I call him out every time.

5045
04:15:36,090 --> 04:15:37,430
Like, he's behind us.

5046
04:15:37,510 --> 04:15:38,490
There he is.

5047
04:15:39,910 --> 04:15:40,930
I'll keep it real.

5048
04:15:40,930 --> 04:15:43,270
As terrible as that wet, this is still wittable.

5049
04:15:43,570 --> 04:15:44,890
Like, there he is.

5050
04:15:45,410 --> 04:15:46,770
What do we do?

5051
04:15:47,290 --> 04:15:48,630
Somebody will take care of it.

5052
04:15:51,350 --> 04:15:52,590
Who's that somebody?

5053
04:15:53,610 --> 04:15:55,010
Who could it be?

5054
04:15:58,530 --> 04:16:00,250
Clearly it's not me.

5055
04:16:04,250 --> 04:16:05,410
Spiderman doesn't kill.

5056
04:16:05,850 --> 04:16:07,070
What the fuck is he doing here?

5057
04:16:08,190 --> 04:16:10,270
What is he doing?

5058
04:16:25,600 --> 04:16:26,860
I don't know.

5059
04:16:27,100 --> 04:16:31,060
If my team actually kills the Spiderman, then like, Spiderman's here.

5060
04:16:33,140 --> 04:16:34,420
Bye Spiderman.

5061
04:16:35,180 --> 04:16:35,920
Behind us?

5062
04:16:40,080 --> 04:16:42,560
Okay, I didn't think that's where he was gonna go.

5063
04:16:42,660 --> 04:16:43,380
Not gonna lie.

5064
04:16:44,960 --> 04:16:45,980
That changes half.

5065
04:16:51,080 --> 04:16:52,100
Did he go back?

5066
04:16:52,740 --> 04:16:53,600
Oh my god, he did.

5067
04:16:57,100 --> 04:16:57,740
I'm scared.

5068
04:17:00,560 --> 04:17:01,700
He don't see you.

5069
04:17:06,260 --> 04:17:07,160
He's gone.

5070
04:17:09,860 --> 04:17:11,360
He's gone.

5071
04:17:17,280 --> 04:17:18,180
He's gone.

5072
04:17:18,180 --> 04:17:20,680
Spiderman behind you.

5073
04:17:24,850 --> 04:17:27,980
I hope you're fucking shooting the Spiderman!

5074
04:17:28,620 --> 04:17:30,140
Because I have the healing!

5075
04:17:30,840 --> 04:17:32,800
I don't have like...

5076
04:17:32,800 --> 04:17:33,620
Oh my god.

5077
04:17:33,620 --> 04:17:36,800
I don't have the privilege to look!

5078
04:17:39,600 --> 04:17:40,640
I can ult in.

5079
04:17:43,260 --> 04:17:45,580
Alright, I'm gonna ult in.

5080
04:17:45,960 --> 04:17:47,080
Oh shit!

5081
04:17:47,900 --> 04:17:48,260
Oh!

5082
04:17:49,460 --> 04:17:50,300
Alright!

5083
04:17:52,040 --> 04:17:53,780
Here we go.

5084
04:17:55,140 --> 04:17:57,180
And then I die here.

5085
04:17:58,300 --> 04:17:59,360
Oh shit.

5086
04:18:03,620 --> 04:18:05,180
Is our Storm actually throwing?

5087
04:18:05,900 --> 04:18:06,260
Now?

5088
04:18:06,780 --> 04:18:09,680
Oh my god, I don't think he knows I stream.

5089
04:18:12,380 --> 04:18:14,920
This is a fucking idiot.

5090
04:18:16,600 --> 04:18:20,160
Now everybody knows I'm a streamer and you're a thrower.

5091
04:18:20,620 --> 04:18:21,300
You're on a list.

5092
04:18:21,760 --> 04:18:23,680
You're on a fucking list now.

5093
04:18:24,740 --> 04:18:25,920
You're on a list.

5094
04:18:29,500 --> 04:18:30,860
Oh shit.

5095
04:18:30,860 --> 04:18:33,360
This guy's gonna be on my fucking list now.

5096
04:18:39,400 --> 04:18:48,160
It's always funny when people don't know I'm like a streamer in their name and they like actively throw as if there's like no consequences just for streaming.

5097
04:18:52,900 --> 04:18:54,540
That's so embarrassing too.

5098
04:18:54,640 --> 04:18:57,040
If they have TTV in their name and they do that.

5099
04:18:57,260 --> 04:19:00,120
That's actually so fucking embarrassing for you.

5100
04:19:00,320 --> 04:19:03,540
Like what's your expectation gonna be?

5101
04:19:11,490 --> 04:19:13,490
Alright, I'm gonna avoid this guy.

5102
04:19:14,750 --> 04:19:16,090
Pretty hilarious.

5103
04:19:18,350 --> 04:19:19,090
Dune game.

5104
04:19:20,690 --> 04:19:27,250
Literally, it's Dune because like nobody, like literally everybody it's crazy.

5105
04:19:27,410 --> 04:19:33,210
I don't know why some TTVers like some TTVers are like that.

5106
04:19:33,390 --> 04:19:36,870
Like they put TTV in their name but they have like the most shittiest reputation.

5107
04:19:37,530 --> 04:19:45,050
Like like the thing is like I'm gonna report you too.

5108
04:19:45,630 --> 04:19:56,890
Throwing um AFK'd and threw himself off off a cliff in game.

5109
04:20:00,210 --> 04:20:04,070
Like is that really, do you really want that to be your reputation?

5110
04:20:08,810 --> 04:20:13,510
Especially when like you're streaming and I'm streaming too.

5111
04:20:13,670 --> 04:20:17,510
Like it's crazy, like I'm not a huge streamer.

5112
04:20:17,550 --> 04:20:20,730
Yeah, I'm not like well known in the FPS scene.

5113
04:20:21,010 --> 04:20:24,030
I'm also a support player and I'm a VTuber.

5114
04:20:25,030 --> 04:20:39,230
Or not TPS, a shooter scene outside of like VTubing but still it's like, it's funny when they don't know I'm a streamer and they like do shit like that in front of everybody and it's like bro you're just embarrassing yourself.

5115
04:20:39,630 --> 04:20:45,190
Like you're just embarrassing yourself.

5116
04:20:45,410 --> 04:20:47,270
It's so fucking cringe.

5117
04:20:48,990 --> 04:20:50,910
It's actually cringe.

5118
04:20:55,340 --> 04:20:59,740
5.8k people like watch him fucking be a little baby.

5119
04:21:02,020 --> 04:21:03,800
Actual little baby man.

5120
04:21:08,000 --> 04:21:13,160
Like if you just fucking play the game it's literally three minutes of your life.

5121
04:21:15,680 --> 04:21:18,980
It's three minutes of your fucking life, play the game.

5122
04:21:19,200 --> 04:21:20,560
It's not that hard.

5123
04:21:29,590 --> 04:21:32,110
Do I have any tank players online right now?

5124
04:21:32,270 --> 04:21:35,030
I only have like, I don't know actually.

5125
04:21:35,870 --> 04:21:37,770
I haven't found a tank player I want to adopt.

5126
04:21:38,070 --> 04:21:40,270
They're all like mediocre.

5127
04:21:41,630 --> 04:21:43,890
I don't want to talk anymore, I'm too sad.

5128
04:21:48,150 --> 04:21:51,690
I don't want to talk in game anymore I'm too sad now.

5129
04:21:52,750 --> 04:21:57,670
These have been some some fucking queues.

5130
04:21:57,810 --> 04:21:59,970
Thank you for the 10 gifted subs!

5131
04:22:00,150 --> 04:22:03,030
Thank you, I really appreciate it.

5132
04:22:04,090 --> 04:22:05,770
These games have been sad.

5133
04:22:10,090 --> 04:22:11,130
Holy shit!

5134
04:22:11,610 --> 04:22:16,110
The three hella Jesus Christ, that was so fast.

5135
04:22:17,010 --> 04:22:18,210
Oh my god.

5136
04:22:19,610 --> 04:22:22,330
You thirsty dogs.

5137
04:22:24,550 --> 04:22:26,390
Luna's banned, what do you mean?

5138
04:22:26,590 --> 04:22:28,750
Luna banned.

5139
04:22:36,340 --> 04:22:37,120
OG.

5140
04:22:40,450 --> 04:22:41,580
They know what they want.

5141
04:22:44,160 --> 04:22:46,860
They know exactly what they want.

5142
04:22:51,460 --> 04:22:56,520
What do you mean I played Mantis?

5143
04:22:56,520 --> 04:22:58,060
That's like, that's actually crazy.

5144
04:22:58,660 --> 04:23:00,300
Luna's like, really banned.

5145
04:23:01,140 --> 04:23:03,520
Has been like, not banned for a while.

5146
04:23:05,960 --> 04:23:10,460
So when you see me online, prof can prove, okay get on.

5147
04:23:11,020 --> 04:23:12,200
Okay get on.

5148
04:23:15,720 --> 04:23:16,700
Right now.

5149
04:23:20,720 --> 04:23:22,300
You wanna fucking say that?

5150
04:23:22,380 --> 04:23:23,100
Get on!

5151
04:23:23,100 --> 04:23:23,120
Get on!

5152
04:23:23,420 --> 04:23:25,740
I'll fucking lose your eternity right now.

5153
04:23:29,740 --> 04:23:30,700
Perfect timing.

5154
04:23:32,380 --> 04:23:34,000
I thought you were a Hulk one trick.

5155
04:23:34,160 --> 04:23:35,700
And Hulk is banned 20%.

5156
04:23:37,960 --> 04:23:42,360
This is like some guy I found in rank matchmaking.

5157
04:23:43,340 --> 04:23:46,300
And I was like, I think it was like the first GM player I saw.

5158
04:23:47,320 --> 04:23:49,440
And then he like, added me and I was like, okay.

5159
04:23:53,100 --> 04:23:53,860
This is crazy, honestly.

5160
04:23:58,640 --> 04:24:01,660
I am trying to give you my leaves.

5161
04:24:03,400 --> 04:24:06,740
Back when GM was like, still super rare, you know?

5162
04:24:07,340 --> 04:24:09,700
Like when GM was still like, incredibly rare.

5163
04:24:14,510 --> 04:24:17,070
And I was still like, a filthy diamond player.

5164
04:24:20,270 --> 04:24:22,230
Let me, let me give head.

5165
04:24:24,210 --> 04:24:26,470
Sorry, that's so bad out of context.

5166
04:24:26,470 --> 04:24:28,190
You know exactly.

5167
04:24:28,290 --> 04:24:29,170
I need that headshot.

5168
04:24:31,990 --> 04:24:32,490
There we go.

5169
04:24:34,470 --> 04:24:35,530
Let me headshot you.

5170
04:24:36,710 --> 04:24:37,530
There we go.

5171
04:24:38,270 --> 04:24:40,490
Jesus Christ, get this mine off me.

5172
04:24:42,450 --> 04:24:43,430
That's fine.

5173
04:24:44,190 --> 04:24:44,810
That's fine.

5174
04:24:46,870 --> 04:24:47,550
Head.

5175
04:24:49,290 --> 04:24:49,630
Ayo.

5176
04:24:52,550 --> 04:24:53,230
Hit.

5177
04:24:54,050 --> 04:24:54,570
Hit.

5178
04:24:54,590 --> 04:24:56,010
Oh, he's so low.

5179
04:24:56,350 --> 04:24:58,690
I'm not comming this game, I'm sad.

5180
04:25:00,350 --> 04:25:02,390
Teams have been way too sad.

5181
04:25:03,230 --> 04:25:05,070
They don't deserve comms anymore.

5182
04:25:07,630 --> 04:25:08,350
There we go.

5183
04:25:09,190 --> 04:25:09,590
Fuck it.

5184
04:25:10,090 --> 04:25:12,130
They're not even pushing, like, I don't care.

5185
04:25:12,770 --> 04:25:14,330
I'm just gonna kill this guy.

5186
04:25:17,390 --> 04:25:20,950
Alright, we don't have support out for like, actual important things.

5187
04:25:20,950 --> 04:25:22,970
If that's- I got too- Ow!

5188
04:25:24,230 --> 04:25:24,970
I'm alive.

5189
04:25:25,950 --> 04:25:27,290
Oh no.

5190
04:25:28,210 --> 04:25:29,430
Oh no.

5191
04:25:31,010 --> 04:25:32,370
Oh no.

5192
04:25:34,830 --> 04:25:35,510
Goodbye.

5193
04:25:40,250 --> 04:25:44,370
I got sad, so no more talking in game until I feel better.

5194
04:25:46,870 --> 04:25:49,310
Until I feel good about myself.

5195
04:25:50,170 --> 04:25:59,190
Ever since that guy yelled at me being like, you threw the game because you held up, but then I was like, what do you want from me?

5196
04:26:01,050 --> 04:26:06,070
I get yelled at for ulting, and I get yelled at for not ulting.

5197
04:26:08,750 --> 04:26:10,310
Oh my god.

5198
04:26:11,170 --> 04:26:12,590
What do you want from me?

5199
04:26:13,970 --> 04:26:18,930
There's no winning, I'm just a- There's no winning, I'm gonna beat you up!

5200
04:26:22,610 --> 04:26:25,150
Don't let it get to you.

5201
04:26:29,440 --> 04:26:31,940
I'll remember that guy's name forever.

5202
04:26:33,300 --> 04:26:37,260
Hella is open and they're willingly playing Squirrel!

5203
04:26:40,620 --> 04:26:44,720
Ever since that- All it takes is one bad day, chat.

5204
04:26:45,440 --> 04:26:47,480
That's all it takes, guys.

5205
04:26:47,940 --> 04:26:49,520
That's all it takes.

5206
04:26:50,540 --> 04:26:51,620
That's all it takes.

5207
04:26:51,820 --> 04:26:54,860
Where's my- I'm a support player!

5208
04:26:55,020 --> 04:26:56,640
We don't have egos!

5209
04:26:58,060 --> 04:27:00,960
We're too sad to have egos.

5210
04:27:05,860 --> 04:27:09,040
We're literally too fucking sad.

5211
04:27:09,860 --> 04:27:10,820
Lies.

5212
04:27:15,080 --> 04:27:20,140
Except for Rocky Raccoons, because I have no idea how the fuck Rocky Raccoon players have egos.

5213
04:27:20,560 --> 04:27:23,520
You literally have no hands playing him.

5214
04:27:27,980 --> 04:27:29,980
No, Loki players don't have egos.

5215
04:27:30,080 --> 04:27:33,160
Loki players are fucking actually...

5216
04:27:34,320 --> 04:27:35,320
They're chads.

5217
04:27:37,400 --> 04:27:39,240
A good Loki player is very scary.

5218
04:27:40,680 --> 04:27:46,460
Because like, if they're playing Loki when there's so many other supports they could play, like Loki is really difficult to master too.

5219
04:27:47,040 --> 04:27:55,700
That's why I feel like Loki players are like, they're making their life harder for themselves playing a very difficult character.

5220
04:27:57,420 --> 04:28:01,920
Because like, it requires a lot of thinking in general, on how to play Loki.

5221
04:28:03,280 --> 04:28:07,720
Like right now, I'm literally just, I damage boost, I heal up, I do this.

5222
04:28:07,960 --> 04:28:13,020
But Loki, you gotta like, think You gotta like, think a lot.

5223
04:28:15,560 --> 04:28:16,160
Did I get off?

5224
04:28:16,780 --> 04:28:17,220
I did.

5225
04:28:17,620 --> 04:28:17,940
Nice.

5226
04:28:20,440 --> 04:28:20,960
Nice.

5227
04:28:23,460 --> 04:28:23,980
Nice.

5228
04:28:24,800 --> 04:28:25,620
You know what?

5229
04:28:25,820 --> 04:28:26,460
Fuck you too.

5230
04:28:26,600 --> 04:28:27,160
You know what?

5231
04:28:27,840 --> 04:28:28,900
Fuck you too.

5232
04:28:29,200 --> 04:28:29,860
That's fucking right.

5233
04:28:29,900 --> 04:28:30,600
I'm not over.

5234
04:28:31,000 --> 04:28:32,440
I'm not done.

5235
04:28:32,920 --> 04:28:33,680
I'm not done.

5236
04:28:38,860 --> 04:28:40,680
I'm not fucking done with you.

5237
04:28:42,880 --> 04:28:44,020
That's fucking right.

5238
04:28:48,100 --> 04:28:51,520
This is not ego, this is literally just me doing my job.

5239
04:28:53,700 --> 04:28:57,080
It's me, it's me doing my job.

5240
04:28:58,140 --> 04:28:59,480
That's not an ego.

5241
04:29:01,700 --> 04:29:04,560
Come on, give me, give me your headshots.

5242
04:29:05,520 --> 04:29:06,320
Nice, thank you.

5243
04:29:06,740 --> 04:29:07,500
That's all I ask.

5244
04:29:07,980 --> 04:29:10,080
I realized that Starlord has not ulted.

5245
04:29:10,080 --> 04:29:10,860
Oh.

5246
04:29:11,860 --> 04:29:12,340
Oh.

5247
04:29:13,020 --> 04:29:14,120
There he goes.

5248
04:29:14,520 --> 04:29:15,860
Wait, where is he?

5249
04:29:16,240 --> 04:29:17,260
There he goes.

5250
04:29:17,420 --> 04:29:17,600
Oh.

5251
04:29:18,740 --> 04:29:20,440
There he goes.

5252
04:29:21,740 --> 04:29:24,060
Um, there he dies, I guess.

5253
04:29:25,660 --> 04:29:27,600
Is our Starlord okay?

5254
04:29:27,900 --> 04:29:28,420
He is.

5255
04:29:30,980 --> 04:29:31,720
How?!

5256
04:29:31,720 --> 04:29:33,060
What?!

5257
04:29:33,060 --> 04:29:34,400
I'm not using it.

5258
04:29:37,600 --> 04:29:38,020
Me?

5259
04:29:38,180 --> 04:29:39,100
Thank you for the 10 gifts!

5260
04:29:39,260 --> 04:29:40,000
Oh shit!

5261
04:29:40,100 --> 04:29:43,700
Oh okay, if I knew we were still going, I would not have...

5262
04:29:44,290 --> 04:29:46,020
Oh my god, I would have not...

5263
04:29:46,020 --> 04:29:46,720
Okay, we wait.

5264
04:29:47,600 --> 04:29:48,480
We wait here.

5265
04:29:50,720 --> 04:29:52,020
I wait here now.

5266
04:29:52,440 --> 04:29:53,560
Orca, thank you for the raid!

5267
04:29:53,720 --> 04:29:54,740
Thank you, thank you!

5268
04:29:54,780 --> 04:29:56,700
I don't need to explain who I am to you guys.

5269
04:29:58,080 --> 04:30:00,280
If you came from Orca's stream.

5270
04:30:02,360 --> 04:30:03,120
Panther?

5271
04:30:04,380 --> 04:30:06,220
Panther, what the fuck are you doing?

5272
04:30:08,400 --> 04:30:09,160
Oh shit!

5273
04:30:09,480 --> 04:30:10,200
Map change!

5274
04:30:10,480 --> 04:30:10,820
Map change!

5275
04:30:12,640 --> 04:30:13,720
Map change!

5276
04:30:15,200 --> 04:30:18,200
Oh, I thought there was...

5277
04:30:20,560 --> 04:30:21,780
Map change!

5278
04:30:23,160 --> 04:30:23,920
Nice.

5279
04:30:26,680 --> 04:30:27,980
Fuck you guys.

5280
04:30:28,420 --> 04:30:29,700
Alright, there we go.

5281
04:30:29,700 --> 04:30:30,180
There we go.

5282
04:30:31,500 --> 04:30:33,060
Alright, we still have to keep going.

5283
04:30:34,560 --> 04:30:35,540
Alright, I'm gonna do it.

5284
04:30:35,580 --> 04:30:35,940
I'm gonna eagle.

5285
04:30:36,620 --> 04:30:38,100
For once in my life, I'm gonna do it.

5286
04:30:41,860 --> 04:30:44,120
And this is why you don't eagle push.

5287
04:30:47,100 --> 04:30:49,520
This is why you don't have any...

5288
04:30:52,720 --> 04:30:53,520
Exactly why.

5289
04:30:53,520 --> 04:30:54,040
Hahaha.

5290
04:30:57,220 --> 04:30:58,680
I learned my lesson!

5291
04:30:59,940 --> 04:31:02,200
I learned my lesson everybody!

5292
04:31:04,580 --> 04:31:06,320
Jesus Christ.

5293
04:31:09,320 --> 04:31:10,820
Oh, he's looking for it.

5294
04:31:11,040 --> 04:31:13,100
He's looking for it right here.

5295
04:31:14,460 --> 04:31:16,260
He's looking for it!

5296
04:31:17,000 --> 04:31:17,760
Alright, I leave.

5297
04:31:20,640 --> 04:31:22,700
Yeah, I had a feeling he was gonna do that.

5298
04:31:23,100 --> 04:31:25,320
Yeah, I had a feeling he was gonna...

5299
04:31:26,100 --> 04:31:26,660
Hahaha.

5300
04:31:30,340 --> 04:31:31,440
Oh my god.

5301
04:31:31,800 --> 04:31:33,000
Please, you have to live.

5302
04:31:33,820 --> 04:31:34,380
Please!

5303
04:31:34,920 --> 04:31:36,580
You have to live!

5304
04:31:37,720 --> 04:31:38,280
No!

5305
04:31:40,740 --> 04:31:42,600
Wait, do I...

5306
04:31:43,960 --> 04:31:44,860
Oh my god.

5307
04:31:44,900 --> 04:31:45,900
I'll respawn here.

5308
04:31:46,640 --> 04:31:47,360
I'll do it here.

5309
04:31:56,200 --> 04:31:56,760
Okay.

5310
04:31:56,760 --> 04:31:57,320
Can someone contest?

5311
04:31:57,560 --> 04:31:58,080
I have my ult.

5312
04:32:00,100 --> 04:32:00,660
Okay.

5313
04:32:01,720 --> 04:32:02,900
The map changed.

5314
04:32:03,000 --> 04:32:05,220
I love it when the map changed, guys.

5315
04:32:06,460 --> 04:32:06,880
Hahaha.

5316
04:32:10,520 --> 04:32:11,720
Are you serious?

5317
04:32:11,940 --> 04:32:12,880
He's so low!

5318
04:32:14,680 --> 04:32:15,580
Who woke him

5319
04:32:20,020 --> 04:32:21,180
up?!

5320
04:32:21,960 --> 04:32:22,520
Okay.

5321
04:32:25,780 --> 04:32:26,220
Please.

5322
04:32:26,740 --> 04:32:27,620
Please.

5323
04:32:29,340 --> 04:32:30,880
Oh my god.

5324
04:32:31,440 --> 04:32:32,800
There we go.

5325
04:32:36,580 --> 04:32:36,840
Go.

5326
04:32:37,660 --> 04:32:38,580
I will...

5327
04:32:38,580 --> 04:32:39,940
I'll beat him up too.

5328
04:32:40,740 --> 04:32:40,800
Hahaha.

5329
04:32:42,020 --> 04:32:45,060
Oh my god.

5330
04:32:45,060 --> 04:32:45,820
I am king.

5331
04:32:46,460 --> 04:32:47,820
I'm the king.

5332
04:32:48,340 --> 04:32:48,800
Oh my god.

5333
04:32:48,880 --> 04:32:52,480
Oh, Jesus Christ.

5334
04:32:53,340 --> 04:32:53,980
Hahaha.

5335
04:32:57,240 --> 04:32:58,540
Oh my god.

5336
04:32:59,220 --> 04:33:01,780
Hell abuser freak.

5337
04:33:02,260 --> 04:33:04,640
Go find your father.

5338
04:33:05,460 --> 04:33:05,880
Okay.

5339
04:33:07,160 --> 04:33:08,560
Don't... Oh my god.

5340
04:33:08,600 --> 04:33:10,060
Wait, don't Q on me.

5341
04:33:10,220 --> 04:33:11,560
I'm so worried.

5342
04:33:17,060 --> 04:33:18,020
Oh, bro.

5343
04:33:18,420 --> 04:33:19,060
Alright.

5344
04:33:21,040 --> 04:33:22,120
Okay, there we go.

5345
04:33:22,440 --> 04:33:23,520
We have our...

5346
04:33:23,520 --> 04:33:25,220
We have our tank players.

5347
04:33:25,220 --> 04:33:27,240
Alright, here we go.

5348
04:33:28,400 --> 04:33:30,580
This is our tank player.

5349
04:33:33,380 --> 04:33:36,740
He has two games to impress us.

5350
04:33:47,140 --> 04:33:48,980
He has two games.

5351
04:33:49,500 --> 04:33:51,240
We give him two games.

5352
04:33:53,640 --> 04:33:57,440
Actually, we're holding tank auditions, guys.

5353
04:33:58,980 --> 04:34:00,560
What do you lose?

5354
04:34:00,620 --> 04:34:01,680
You lose member.

5355
04:34:02,460 --> 04:34:05,460
Guys, we're holding tank auditions right now.

5356
04:34:06,000 --> 04:34:09,200
So, like...

5357
04:34:09,200 --> 04:34:09,580
Alright.

5358
04:34:09,940 --> 04:34:10,940
Are you a tank player?

5359
04:34:12,040 --> 04:34:12,740
Oh, okay.

5360
04:34:13,260 --> 04:34:15,080
Okay, what's your win rate, though?

5361
04:34:15,540 --> 04:34:15,780
Guys.

5362
04:34:16,120 --> 04:34:16,520
Hahaha.

5363
04:34:16,520 --> 04:34:18,140
What's your tank?

5364
04:34:18,940 --> 04:34:19,740
Woah.

5365
04:34:22,240 --> 04:34:23,540
Oh my god.

5366
04:34:23,600 --> 04:34:25,480
Wait, but what happened here, though?

5367
04:34:28,240 --> 04:34:32,420
Tank auditions are now open.

5368
04:34:34,940 --> 04:34:38,620
It's like American Idol, but like Marvel Rivals Idol.

5369
04:34:40,040 --> 04:34:42,920
Yeah, you gotta warm up.

5370
04:34:46,450 --> 04:34:47,470
Oh, we're dodging?

5371
04:34:47,710 --> 04:34:48,550
I think we're dodging.

5372
04:34:48,850 --> 04:34:51,090
I mean, to be fair, that game was like a shit show.

5373
04:34:51,250 --> 04:34:52,270
So, like, I'm not surprised.

5374
04:34:52,550 --> 04:34:54,510
I'm gonna grab water real quick.

5375
04:34:54,610 --> 04:34:55,330
I'll be right back.

5376
04:35:11,580 --> 04:35:12,140
Maybe I won't.

5377
04:35:12,240 --> 04:35:13,140
You fucking...

5378
04:35:14,160 --> 04:35:14,960
You left!

5379
04:35:15,380 --> 04:35:17,080
What do you mean, Maze?

5380
04:35:17,380 --> 04:35:20,000
I've been streaming for five hours already.

5381
04:35:20,140 --> 04:35:21,100
What do you mean?

5382
04:35:30,800 --> 04:35:31,200
Hahaha.

5383
04:35:31,920 --> 04:35:32,900
It's too late.

5384
04:35:35,160 --> 04:35:36,980
This is Lao's first game.

5385
04:35:37,180 --> 04:35:37,880
If he...

5386
04:35:37,880 --> 04:35:40,820
This is Lao's first game.

5387
04:35:45,610 --> 04:35:46,550
I'm looking for a stack.

5388
04:35:46,650 --> 04:35:47,670
How bad could it be?

5389
04:35:48,950 --> 04:35:50,950
We would automatically get two tank players.

5390
04:35:52,410 --> 04:35:52,970
Oh my god.

5391
04:35:53,010 --> 04:35:53,670
We got a stack?

5392
04:35:54,230 --> 04:35:55,810
Can I pull up the full shroud?

5393
04:35:56,990 --> 04:35:58,770
Will he, like, force stack to 500?

5394
04:36:00,110 --> 04:36:01,150
That's the dream.

5395
04:36:01,370 --> 04:36:01,810
Honestly.

5396
04:36:01,810 --> 04:36:03,070
That's a...

5397
04:36:04,230 --> 04:36:05,590
That's a dream.

5398
04:36:10,390 --> 04:36:12,890
I don't even know what the queue times are.

5399
04:36:14,310 --> 04:36:15,690
Is there a downside?

5400
04:36:15,850 --> 04:36:16,470
Queue times?

5401
04:36:16,790 --> 04:36:18,250
But I don't know what the queue times are.

5402
04:36:19,390 --> 04:36:21,010
We could try force stacking.

5403
04:36:21,430 --> 04:36:22,650
We'll see how the queue times go.

5404
04:36:25,370 --> 04:36:27,130
Literally, VTuber shroud.

5405
04:36:30,310 --> 04:36:31,030
Hahaha.

5406
04:36:31,590 --> 04:36:34,290
VTuber shroud, but like, not even...

5407
04:36:35,110 --> 04:36:37,010
But like, what is it called?

5408
04:36:37,370 --> 04:36:38,690
Not even a dollar store.

5409
04:36:38,990 --> 04:36:40,350
Dollar store shroud.

5410
04:36:40,970 --> 04:36:41,470
Honestly.

5411
04:36:43,110 --> 04:36:45,790
Let's see what the queue time, estimated time is.

5412
04:36:47,590 --> 04:36:49,210
Alright, I'll stop queue.

5413
04:36:50,330 --> 04:36:53,130
We're gonna, we're gonna force stack.

5414
04:36:55,530 --> 04:36:56,250
Hahaha.

5415
04:36:56,250 --> 04:36:56,750
Hahaha.

5416
04:36:57,990 --> 04:37:04,910
Fuck it, if people in top 10 are min-maxing, I'm gonna min-max bottom 10.

5417
04:37:05,910 --> 04:37:08,930
I'm gonna min-max GM1.

5418
04:37:10,230 --> 04:37:12,750
That justifies it for me.

5419
04:37:13,370 --> 04:37:15,470
That justifies it.

5420
04:37:16,010 --> 04:37:16,070
Hahaha.

5421
04:37:20,050 --> 04:37:21,250
Let's go.

5422
04:37:21,790 --> 04:37:23,730
I went through hell already.

5423
04:37:23,730 --> 04:37:24,590
It's fine.

5424
04:37:26,790 --> 04:37:27,830
It's fine.

5425
04:37:27,930 --> 04:37:29,290
I went through hell, it's alright.

5426
04:37:29,770 --> 04:37:30,370
Hahaha.

5427
04:37:33,610 --> 04:37:34,730
It's okay.

5428
04:37:37,610 --> 04:37:38,970
Who's gonna min-max bot?

5429
04:37:39,070 --> 04:37:45,430
I swear, if I like, lose this stack, I deserve to lose at this point.

5430
04:37:45,430 --> 04:37:45,730
Hahaha.

5431
04:37:46,470 --> 04:37:50,910
I actually deserve to fucking lose.

5432
04:37:50,910 --> 04:37:51,590
Hahaha.

5433
04:37:54,590 --> 04:37:58,550
Like, that's the game telling me like, it's over for you, Doki.

5434
04:37:58,810 --> 04:38:00,730
Like, you're here forever.

5435
04:38:01,110 --> 04:38:04,790
It's like, you know how they like, turn on east coast?

5436
04:38:04,930 --> 04:38:06,550
Oh my god, we're doing it.

5437
04:38:06,610 --> 04:38:08,050
We're bringing east coast back.

5438
04:38:08,570 --> 04:38:12,690
We're fucking welcoming back the brethrens in east coast.

5439
04:38:13,030 --> 04:38:17,450
I mean, we're taking two east coast players, there's no way they cancel us out.

5440
04:38:18,010 --> 04:38:19,250
We're literally four to two.

5441
04:38:19,250 --> 04:38:22,590
We're four versus two easties.

5442
04:38:22,810 --> 04:38:25,110
There's no way they can cancel us out.

5443
04:38:25,230 --> 04:38:29,110
There's no- It means the enemy team has six east coast players.

5444
04:38:30,350 --> 04:38:30,990
Um...

5445
04:38:30,990 --> 04:38:31,830
Hahaha.

5446
04:38:33,390 --> 04:38:36,650
If I lose- No, we can't end stream until eternity.

5447
04:38:37,310 --> 04:38:38,890
We can't end stream.

5448
04:38:40,450 --> 04:38:42,510
The opponent- Exactly!

5449
04:38:43,070 --> 04:38:49,030
We'll have two east coast players, and then the opponent will have six east coast players.

5450
04:38:49,190 --> 04:38:53,070
That's like- It's like- It balances everything out.

5451
04:38:53,210 --> 04:38:54,110
We're so fine.

5452
04:38:54,490 --> 04:38:54,770
Hahaha.

5453
04:38:58,570 --> 04:38:59,750
It'll be okay.

5454
04:39:03,210 --> 04:39:04,390
Don't jinx it.

5455
04:39:04,470 --> 04:39:06,210
Oh my god, you know what?

5456
04:39:06,410 --> 04:39:08,970
Like, bro, I got yelled at today.

5457
04:39:09,110 --> 04:39:10,150
I'm- Hahaha.

5458
04:39:10,770 --> 04:39:12,930
When somebody yells at me, I crumble.

5459
04:39:13,190 --> 04:39:19,330
I'm like- I'm just- I'll just think about it and be like, why'd he yell at me?

5460
04:39:19,670 --> 04:39:19,970
Hahaha.

5461
04:39:22,530 --> 04:39:23,010
Hahaha.

5462
04:39:24,130 --> 04:39:29,090
I'm the one that threw when the Mantis never supported me.

5463
04:39:29,290 --> 04:39:29,710
Hahaha.

5464
04:39:31,030 --> 04:39:32,890
I can never move on!

5465
04:39:33,310 --> 04:39:34,710
No, this is why I- Okay.

5466
04:39:34,950 --> 04:39:37,930
No, I'll just give you guys- Why I never- I don't talk in game.

5467
04:39:38,190 --> 04:39:40,570
I was so desperate to climb when I started.

5468
04:39:40,850 --> 04:39:45,630
Uh, I haven't IG- Like, not- I don't talk at all for the longest time.

5469
04:39:46,150 --> 04:39:56,290
This literally broke- Marvel Rivals literally broke my zero-talking in-game streak because I was so desperate to win.

5470
04:39:56,790 --> 04:40:03,130
But in Overwatch, I was known as a shotcaller in Overwatch and, like, I was really, really good at it.

5471
04:40:03,430 --> 04:40:09,770
But then I got yelled at one time and then I never talked in game ever since.

5472
04:40:10,390 --> 04:40:10,390
Hahaha.

5473
04:40:11,470 --> 04:40:17,530
I had never- talked in game since because I got yelled at.

5474
04:40:18,050 --> 04:40:26,550
And then I never talked again in a game of randoms because I didn't like- I was just like, I'm sad.

5475
04:40:26,990 --> 04:40:28,450
I'm sad.

5476
04:40:29,370 --> 04:40:31,630
That's actual Overwatch PTSD.

5477
04:40:34,510 --> 04:40:35,690
It was Overwatch.

5478
04:40:36,370 --> 04:40:39,670
I got like- I don't mind if people are like misogynistic.

5479
04:40:39,890 --> 04:40:42,950
I mean, okay, like, it's not that I don't mind.

5480
04:40:43,310 --> 04:40:44,490
Like, I can take that.

5481
04:40:44,610 --> 04:40:46,730
Like, I can take people being misogynistic.

5482
04:40:47,090 --> 04:40:57,950
But, like, what I can't take is people, like, saying I threw the game or, like, because of something I did or, like, calling me shit.

5483
04:40:58,390 --> 04:41:00,250
Not because I'm a woman.

5484
04:41:00,830 --> 04:41:01,730
I- hahaha.

5485
04:41:06,330 --> 04:41:07,450
I care.

5486
04:41:07,730 --> 04:41:13,870
But, like, I can take misogyny because it's like, alright, they're just fucking stupid, you know?

5487
04:41:14,030 --> 04:41:23,450
But then when they hurt me via, like, skill-wise, skill-wise, it's like, it hurts me even more.

5488
04:41:27,050 --> 04:41:28,450
Misogyny enabling.

5489
04:41:31,090 --> 04:41:36,610
I can handle- Yeah, I can handle make a sandwich over how did you threw the game.

5490
04:41:36,690 --> 04:41:37,730
It was all your fault.

5491
04:41:37,730 --> 04:41:39,030
Or, like, you're shocked.

5492
04:41:39,370 --> 04:41:41,250
Shut up, you're shotcalling terrible.

5493
04:41:41,450 --> 04:41:42,370
Or shit like that.

5494
04:41:46,750 --> 04:41:54,830
So, it's like, because I can laugh over- I can laugh at somebody trying to be, like, a woman hater.

5495
04:41:55,250 --> 04:41:58,370
But, like, I can't laugh at somebody calling me bad.

5496
04:42:03,370 --> 04:42:06,430
Yeah, skill issue is actually my kryptonite.

5497
04:42:06,630 --> 04:42:07,510
It actually is.

5498
04:42:08,970 --> 04:42:12,890
She identifies as a gamer first.

5499
04:42:15,930 --> 04:42:17,490
For real.

5500
04:42:20,010 --> 04:42:33,690
So, like, literally, I literally broke my, like, rank voice comm streak of, like, zero voice comms with randoms for, like, five plus years, I think.

5501
04:42:33,690 --> 04:42:42,030
I think, like, I haven't commed against- with randoms in four to five years.

5502
04:42:42,230 --> 04:42:48,310
And it's, like, this game broke the- like, two days ago, broke the streak because I was so fucking desperate to win.

5503
04:42:48,730 --> 04:42:51,890
I was- I was so desperate.

5504
04:42:54,710 --> 04:42:59,370
The three genders, male, female, gamer.

5505
04:43:01,010 --> 04:43:07,750
And then the next dude, and now I will never talk again because of that one Spider-Man player.

5506
04:43:08,330 --> 04:43:10,730
That one Spider-Man player.

5507
04:43:11,530 --> 04:43:16,650
That's now shutting me up for the next five years now.

5508
04:43:19,150 --> 04:43:19,870
No!

5509
04:43:20,590 --> 04:43:23,190
You chuckle nuts!

5510
04:43:23,730 --> 04:43:29,130
And then I thought it was supposed to be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man!

5511
04:43:29,230 --> 04:43:31,170
What happened to the friendly?

5512
04:43:32,390 --> 04:43:34,590
What happened to him?

5513
04:43:36,430 --> 04:43:42,210
Alright, guys, if we don't get a game in, uh...

5514
04:43:42,950 --> 04:43:48,010
one more minute, because I'll be like- okay, no, I'll give you guys two minutes.

5515
04:43:48,110 --> 04:43:49,950
I'll give us a two-minute buffer.

5516
04:43:50,990 --> 04:43:54,430
I'm sorry, Lao, but I'm sorry, Lao.

5517
04:43:54,430 --> 04:43:57,350
We'll do- we'll- auditions might be over.

5518
04:44:03,780 --> 04:44:05,180
We'll go again.

5519
04:44:05,520 --> 04:44:06,780
We'll go again.

5520
04:44:07,200 --> 04:44:09,300
We'll have Lao next time.

5521
04:44:09,480 --> 04:44:11,000
We'll have Lao next stream.

5522
04:44:11,780 --> 04:44:13,460
Lao might be the best player here.

5523
04:44:21,120 --> 04:44:22,820
I mean, better than me for sure.

5524
04:44:23,120 --> 04:44:24,200
No, no, he's right.

5525
04:44:24,400 --> 04:44:25,300
No, better than me.

5526
04:44:25,360 --> 04:44:27,360
I'm definitely not the best player in this team.

5527
04:44:27,660 --> 04:44:28,040
No.

5528
04:44:38,620 --> 04:44:44,360
We might- We might- Lao is the lucky charm.

5529
04:44:46,600 --> 04:44:48,420
We'll wait for you to queue it.

5530
04:44:48,500 --> 04:44:49,480
We played a few back.

5531
04:44:49,580 --> 04:44:50,380
Not sure yet.

5532
04:44:50,480 --> 04:44:50,680
Wait.

5533
04:44:52,380 --> 04:44:57,600
You gotta- Okay, but like, you gotta tell me like, what few back, though.

5534
04:44:58,160 --> 04:45:00,800
There's- Like, years ago?

5535
04:45:01,380 --> 04:45:02,080
Few back?

5536
04:45:02,160 --> 04:45:04,060
I know you were in my team with random characters.

5537
04:45:04,060 --> 04:45:06,820
I'm queuing in Marvel Rivals.

5538
04:45:07,720 --> 04:45:08,900
What if they kick me?

5539
04:45:09,120 --> 04:45:12,660
Guys, I'm- If they kick me out, who's gonna watch their games?

5540
04:45:12,740 --> 04:45:14,760
I'm literally the only one streaming right now.

5541
04:45:16,940 --> 04:45:23,080
If we- If they kick me out, you guys won't even be able to watch any of the games!

5542
04:45:23,920 --> 04:45:27,100
They're gonna be queuing and you can't even watch it!

5543
04:45:29,200 --> 04:45:30,580
Let's spectate them.

5544
04:45:30,580 --> 04:45:30,680
They're gonna -

5545
04:45:33,720 --> 04:45:37,360
They're just gonna spectate their fucking matchup.

5546
04:45:39,180 --> 04:45:41,760
Guys, it's about my rank roids!

5547
04:45:43,260 --> 04:45:44,640
What do you mean?

5548
04:45:45,240 --> 04:45:46,980
I'm the desperate one here!

5549
04:45:47,400 --> 04:45:49,000
I literally made a four stack!

5550
04:45:53,190 --> 04:45:54,230
Commitator, alright.

5551
04:45:54,710 --> 04:45:57,690
We watch part of their games and see if I'm the problem.

5552
04:45:58,350 --> 04:46:04,690
Guys, we all know that as a support player, we struggle the most.

5553
04:46:07,070 --> 04:46:08,650
Okay, when it hits the 10 minute mark.

5554
04:46:08,850 --> 04:46:09,510
Guys, alright.

5555
04:46:10,070 --> 04:46:10,790
10 minute mark.

5556
04:46:12,250 --> 04:46:15,090
We'll do 10 minute- I'm gonna up it up.

5557
04:46:15,190 --> 04:46:16,450
We'll do 10 minute mark.

5558
04:46:16,830 --> 04:46:18,850
Also, right away, thank you for the tier 1 sub.

5559
04:46:18,930 --> 04:46:19,910
Thank you, thank you.

5560
04:46:21,110 --> 04:46:21,510
Uh...

5561
04:46:21,510 --> 04:46:24,630
Prime sub for two months.

5562
04:46:24,710 --> 04:46:25,450
Thank you, thank you.

5563
04:46:25,650 --> 04:46:27,290
Thank you for the tier 1 sub.

5564
04:46:27,390 --> 04:46:28,430
Thank you, thank you.

5565
04:46:28,630 --> 04:46:29,790
No, I'm not doom queuing.

5566
04:46:29,890 --> 04:46:33,250
I swear to God, I'm- Oh my God, we fucking did it!

5567
04:46:33,750 --> 04:46:38,490
I swear if the enemy team is like the best fucking team in the fucking- Oh my God, it's Wavy!

5568
04:46:40,890 --> 04:46:46,230
Oh my- I swear if they get like- Oh my God, it's fucking Wavy.

5569
04:46:46,810 --> 04:46:49,950
Oh my God, I- It - Lau.

5570
04:46:50,390 --> 04:46:52,130
Lau, we lose to Wavy, Lau?

5571
04:46:52,330 --> 04:46:53,590
I'm fucking recruiting Wavy.

5572
04:46:57,110 --> 04:46:58,290
I'm freaking Wavy.

5573
04:46:58,290 --> 04:47:00,610
We lose to Wavy.

5574
04:47:02,750 --> 04:47:04,470
I'm auditioning Wavy.

5575
04:47:05,010 --> 04:47:06,390
I'm gonna audition him.

5576
04:47:06,870 --> 04:47:09,250
Alright, this is your audition.

5577
04:47:12,870 --> 04:47:14,430
Oh wait, last of Bruce.

5578
04:47:14,610 --> 04:47:18,510
I don't even know if I can battle, cause I know he's the Bruce mate.

5579
04:47:21,450 --> 04:47:24,310
This is your only chance.

5580
04:47:27,410 --> 04:47:31,310
This is both- Exactly, this is Lau and Wavy's audition.

5581
04:47:33,630 --> 04:47:34,230
Exactly.

5582
04:47:36,130 --> 04:47:38,630
Oh, they already banned Bruce Banner, that's fine.

5583
04:47:39,010 --> 04:47:40,210
We'll ban Helidon.

5584
04:47:41,090 --> 04:47:43,050
Titan and Wavy will pop off for sure.

5585
04:47:44,510 --> 04:47:50,470
No, I feel like Wavy, if you diff Lau, you win the audition.

5586
04:47:50,470 --> 04:47:50,990
Audition.

5587
04:47:55,970 --> 04:47:58,710
You'll need a top-notch team to win this one.

5588
04:47:58,810 --> 04:48:01,290
Life energy is a powerful weapon against evil.

5589
04:48:01,690 --> 04:48:04,490
Get down on the first game.

5590
04:48:07,090 --> 04:48:10,090
Wavy has to go against Mace.

5591
04:48:10,470 --> 04:48:16,110
Yeah, but like, Wavy is Wavy is like, um...

5592
04:48:16,110 --> 04:48:18,650
Oh my god, Mace on Adam.

5593
04:48:18,650 --> 04:48:19,690
Alright, let's do it.

5594
04:48:19,750 --> 04:48:21,110
Let's go.

5595
04:48:26,580 --> 04:48:27,780
No, it truly is.

5596
04:48:28,080 --> 04:48:28,460
Guys.

5597
04:48:30,600 --> 04:48:31,780
Guys, it truly is.

5598
04:48:31,980 --> 04:48:34,780
It basically is Lau versus Wavy now.

5599
04:48:35,260 --> 04:48:36,280
It really is.

5600
04:48:36,980 --> 04:48:39,360
Cause like, Wavy is also a tank player.

5601
04:48:39,880 --> 04:48:42,820
So like, it truly is.

5602
04:48:44,580 --> 04:48:45,460
Wait, what did he say?

5603
04:48:47,280 --> 04:48:48,200
It really is.

5604
04:48:48,340 --> 04:48:48,900
This is it.

5605
04:48:48,960 --> 04:48:49,700
This is your audition.

5606
04:48:51,280 --> 04:48:53,960
This is literally your audition right now, Lau.

5607
04:48:54,280 --> 04:48:55,240
Right here.

5608
04:48:55,980 --> 04:48:56,700
Right now.

5609
04:48:57,460 --> 04:48:59,140
Team Wavy or team Lau.

5610
04:48:59,380 --> 04:49:00,940
Put in your votes, guys.

5611
04:49:03,200 --> 04:49:05,160
Put in your votes, guys.

5612
04:49:08,420 --> 04:49:09,320
Let's go.

5613
04:49:09,660 --> 04:49:11,440
What team are you guys on?

5614
04:49:12,100 --> 04:49:13,720
What team will you guys be on?

5615
04:49:15,760 --> 04:49:17,440
Oh, it's the Spiderman.

5616
04:49:17,440 --> 04:49:19,100
Oh my god, not the Spiderman.

5617
04:49:21,160 --> 04:49:21,480
What?

5618
04:49:23,860 --> 04:49:25,140
I'm scared.

5619
04:49:30,900 --> 04:49:34,480
Wait, there's a Spiderman behind me.

5620
04:49:36,440 --> 04:49:37,220
Spiderman one.

5621
04:49:43,380 --> 04:49:45,000
I'm just fighting on point again.

5622
04:49:46,260 --> 04:49:48,260
Oh my god.

5623
04:49:49,400 --> 04:49:51,340
We have such low heals.

5624
04:49:54,200 --> 04:49:55,520
Spiderman behind.

5625
04:49:57,640 --> 04:49:57,980
Nice.

5626
04:50:00,260 --> 04:50:01,540
That's fine.

5627
04:50:02,500 --> 04:50:04,520
Everything is so fine.

5628
04:50:06,480 --> 04:50:08,320
What's my rank right now?

5629
04:50:09,420 --> 04:50:11,220
Things were really rough.

5630
04:50:14,300 --> 04:50:15,800
We had some...

5631
04:50:15,800 --> 04:50:17,800
We had a lot of doom cures today.

5632
04:50:23,740 --> 04:50:24,960
Where's the squirrel?

5633
04:50:25,860 --> 04:50:27,220
Oh no, the squirrel is coming over.

5634
04:50:27,320 --> 04:50:27,840
I'm scared.

5635
04:50:32,240 --> 04:50:33,580
Oh my god, I'm ulting this.

5636
04:50:34,520 --> 04:50:35,060
Nice.

5637
04:50:36,700 --> 04:50:37,460
Oh, Matrix is asleep.

5638
04:50:39,320 --> 04:50:40,460
Okay, that's on you.

5639
04:50:40,640 --> 04:50:41,780
That's actually on you.

5640
04:50:45,800 --> 04:50:46,760
Spiderman half.

5641
04:50:49,560 --> 04:50:51,780
Oh my god, you guys are so low.

5642
04:50:52,480 --> 04:50:53,860
You guys are so low.

5643
04:50:55,160 --> 04:50:56,640
Oh my god.

5644
04:50:56,900 --> 04:50:58,360
I can't, I can't.

5645
04:50:58,460 --> 04:50:59,240
Spiderman behind us.

5646
04:51:03,040 --> 04:51:03,680
He's asleep.

5647
04:51:03,800 --> 04:51:04,020
He's asleep.

5648
04:51:07,240 --> 04:51:08,600
I didn't rez him.

5649
04:51:08,700 --> 04:51:09,200
Oh, nevermind.

5650
04:51:11,200 --> 04:51:11,660
Goodbye.

5651
04:51:15,900 --> 04:51:17,100
Oh shit, he got a kill.

5652
04:51:17,500 --> 04:51:18,220
I could've rezzed.

5653
04:51:21,840 --> 04:51:22,320
Oh.

5654
04:51:26,260 --> 04:51:27,220
Nice, I'm damage boosting you.

5655
04:51:27,220 --> 04:51:28,080
We still win, we still win.

5656
04:51:28,440 --> 04:51:30,760
I got you healed.

5657
04:51:34,160 --> 04:51:35,000
Bye Wavy.

5658
04:51:38,520 --> 04:51:39,360
Bye Wavy.

5659
04:51:42,080 --> 04:51:42,500
Damn.

5660
04:51:43,400 --> 04:51:45,640
I did that and then fucking left him with a signature.

5661
04:51:47,140 --> 04:51:47,980
Oh jeez.

5662
04:51:48,760 --> 04:51:49,680
Wait, is Spiderman behind me?

5663
04:51:49,820 --> 04:51:50,160
He's asleep.

5664
04:51:53,920 --> 04:51:56,760
I have no idea if they did anything with that Spiderman.

5665
04:51:57,660 --> 04:51:59,540
But like, I think they did it.

5666
04:52:00,020 --> 04:52:01,100
I think that Spiderman might touch.

5667
04:52:01,980 --> 04:52:02,720
Yeah, Spiderman's behind.

5668
04:52:06,160 --> 04:52:06,860
Someone's asleep.

5669
04:52:09,960 --> 04:52:10,840
Dream, dream, dream.

5670
04:52:10,960 --> 04:52:11,880
Dream's half, dream's one.

5671
04:52:15,140 --> 04:52:16,720
Oh wait, we got the point, it's fine.

5672
04:52:17,120 --> 04:52:17,740
I'm not ulting.

5673
04:52:21,820 --> 04:52:22,700
Oh, please.

5674
04:52:27,090 --> 04:52:28,390
Come on now, you've got this.

5675
04:52:33,630 --> 04:52:35,590
You've gotta outpig him.

5676
04:52:35,690 --> 04:52:36,650
This is your life.

5677
04:52:37,090 --> 04:52:38,270
We can walk out, we've got a safe here.

5678
04:52:40,130 --> 04:52:41,090
Come on.

5679
04:52:42,150 --> 04:52:43,110
That's right.

5680
04:52:43,730 --> 04:52:44,730
Fight for it.

5681
04:52:45,010 --> 04:52:47,450
Fight for your place in the V2 for Shroudstack.

5682
04:52:48,550 --> 04:52:51,350
I'm gonna push the cart now.

5683
04:52:52,230 --> 04:52:53,790
While I was doing it.

5684
04:52:56,610 --> 04:52:58,250
I can't heal you guys, I'm on cart.

5685
04:52:58,250 --> 04:52:59,830
Alright, Spiderman above.

5686
04:53:01,910 --> 04:53:03,050
Oh, wrong one.

5687
04:53:04,090 --> 04:53:05,730
My shield's broken, back up.

5688
04:53:06,630 --> 04:53:07,110
That's cool though.

5689
04:53:07,710 --> 04:53:08,710
You're so healthy.

5690
04:53:12,000 --> 04:53:13,370
Spiderman behind us, he's asleep.

5691
04:53:15,010 --> 04:53:16,210
He's one, Siren's one.

5692
04:53:20,210 --> 04:53:22,510
Oh my god, no, no, no, no.

5693
04:53:22,650 --> 04:53:23,830
I'm fucking pushing, no.

5694
04:53:24,650 --> 04:53:25,570
Oh, he's one.

5695
04:53:25,570 --> 04:53:26,010
Nice.

5696
04:53:31,090 --> 04:53:32,530
He's one.

5697
04:53:35,410 --> 04:53:36,910
Fight for your life!

5698
04:53:38,310 --> 04:53:39,650
Can we destroy this?

5699
04:53:39,730 --> 04:53:40,230
I don't think we can.

5700
04:53:45,370 --> 04:53:46,450
I'm gonna push this.

5701
04:53:49,930 --> 04:53:51,790
Oh my god.

5702
04:53:52,150 --> 04:53:53,870
I can't see you guys for heals.

5703
04:53:55,570 --> 04:53:56,350
I'm fine, I'm fine.

5704
04:53:56,370 --> 04:53:57,270
Are you?

5705
04:53:58,450 --> 04:53:59,570
Are you?

5706
04:54:01,310 --> 04:54:02,190
Is Spiderman on me?

5707
04:54:02,350 --> 04:54:03,030
Is he asleep again?

5708
04:54:07,820 --> 04:54:10,660
Oh, I sw- Oh my god, oh my god.

5709
04:54:10,760 --> 04:54:12,200
I swear to god, it's a Spiderman!

5710
04:54:16,180 --> 04:54:18,560
Oh, whoops.

5711
04:54:20,900 --> 04:54:23,040
I swear to fucking god.

5712
04:54:23,600 --> 04:54:28,540
I do everything I can to sleep this Spiderman and yet he lives.

5713
04:54:28,920 --> 04:54:29,800
Like, what's the point?

5714
04:54:30,520 --> 04:54:32,020
Actually, what's the point?

5715
04:54:32,840 --> 04:54:35,840
What the fuck is the point of his- What do I do?

5716
04:54:36,560 --> 04:54:37,680
Like, what do I do?

5717
04:54:39,400 --> 04:54:40,600
Oh, he's asleep.

5718
04:54:40,840 --> 04:54:42,540
I'm gonna push.

5719
04:54:42,640 --> 04:54:43,480
We're gonna push this.

5720
04:54:45,900 --> 04:54:47,320
Spiderman on me.

5721
04:54:51,820 --> 04:54:53,000
Oh, I like that.

5722
04:54:54,360 --> 04:54:55,260
Let him live.

5723
04:54:56,060 --> 04:54:56,640
I'm ulting.

5724
04:55:01,140 --> 04:55:02,140
Can we just have?

5725
04:55:03,440 --> 04:55:04,040
Can we just have?

5726
04:55:07,820 --> 04:55:08,520
Oh, man, I'm one.

5727
04:55:12,800 --> 04:55:15,900
Is Spiderman on me?

5728
04:55:15,920 --> 04:55:17,800
Is Spiderman on me?

5729
04:55:19,600 --> 04:55:20,180
Or am I still on me?

5730
04:55:20,580 --> 04:55:20,700
No!

5731
04:55:23,140 --> 04:55:23,620
No!

5732
04:55:25,620 --> 04:55:26,100
Please!

5733
04:55:27,620 --> 04:55:30,700
How do I- How does the Spiderman keep living?

5734
04:55:34,580 --> 04:55:36,080
Now this ain't looking so good.

5735
04:55:36,180 --> 04:55:39,880
This ain't looking so good.

5736
04:55:40,280 --> 04:55:41,080
Wavy's MVP.

5737
04:55:45,640 --> 04:55:47,880
Ain't looking so good.

5738
04:55:49,800 --> 04:55:51,200
He's MVP.

5739
04:55:51,200 --> 04:55:51,700
He's MVP.

5740
04:55:55,720 --> 04:55:57,060
Spiderman behind us.

5741
04:56:01,830 --> 04:56:04,150
Oh my god, where did he go?

5742
04:56:04,270 --> 04:56:06,490
There's so many pictures on my screen.

5743
04:56:07,050 --> 04:56:09,150
I can't tell where he went.

5744
04:56:12,490 --> 04:56:15,090
I don't wanna get missed by the amazing Spiderman.

5745
04:56:15,410 --> 04:56:15,990
We gotta reset.

5746
04:56:24,110 --> 04:56:24,590
Jay!

5747
04:56:25,770 --> 04:56:27,830
You're so alive!

5748
04:56:30,550 --> 04:56:35,110
Oh, I'm trying to keep you up, Jay.

5749
04:56:44,390 --> 04:56:45,630
Strange one, strange low.

5750
04:56:47,690 --> 04:56:49,230
Spiderman behind- Oh, Venom behind me.

5751
04:56:55,030 --> 04:56:55,990
Oh my god.

5752
04:56:57,170 --> 04:56:58,350
Oh my god.

5753
04:56:58,870 --> 04:57:00,250
There's a Spiderman behind me again.

5754
04:57:00,790 --> 04:57:01,990
I might be dead to this.

5755
04:57:08,630 --> 04:57:09,230
Please.

5756
04:57:10,890 --> 04:57:15,330
I'm struggling because I can't even like-

5757
04:57:22,970 --> 04:57:24,530
Oh my god.

5758
04:57:25,150 --> 04:57:26,010
Venom, Venom, Venom, Venom.

5759
04:57:28,130 --> 04:57:29,670
Venom's half, Venom one.

5760
04:57:30,550 --> 04:57:31,490
Venom low.

5761
04:57:33,850 --> 04:57:34,730
Venom's still low.

5762
04:57:37,650 --> 04:57:41,530
I'm gonna- Spiderman, Spiderman, Spiderman.

5763
04:57:50,760 --> 04:57:52,240
I'm backing out a little.

5764
04:57:56,940 --> 04:57:58,560
That's fucking right!

5765
04:58:01,120 --> 04:58:02,920
3, 2, 0.

5766
04:58:03,920 --> 04:58:04,720
Finally!

5767
04:58:05,740 --> 04:58:06,420
Finally!

5768
04:58:06,940 --> 04:58:13,100
The one- Oh my god, I slept in a million times and he's finally dead.

5769
04:58:14,960 --> 04:58:16,560
Finally dead.

5770
04:58:16,880 --> 04:58:20,600
It only took seven sleeps before my team actually killed him.

5771
04:58:23,780 --> 04:58:27,120
It really only took seven sleeps.

5772
04:58:31,120 --> 04:58:32,780
Oh my god, finally.

5773
04:58:33,220 --> 04:58:34,160
It's over.

5774
04:58:34,680 --> 04:58:37,000
It's actually over.

5775
04:58:38,700 --> 04:58:40,780
Literally every time.

5776
04:58:41,700 --> 04:58:44,760
Every fucking time.

5777
04:58:48,480 --> 04:58:49,940
Is Doki back to eternity yet?

5778
04:58:50,000 --> 04:58:50,900
Am I still streaming?

5779
04:58:52,780 --> 04:58:55,520
Am I still here streaming?

5780
04:58:55,900 --> 04:58:56,420
Whoa!

5781
04:59:01,120 --> 04:59:02,520
Let's stay on strange, yeah.

5782
04:59:07,860 --> 04:59:09,120
We're still here.

5783
04:59:10,280 --> 04:59:11,940
I'm turning to Eddie Brock in Spiderman 3.

5784
04:59:12,060 --> 04:59:15,240
No, I'm fucking- I'm not Eddie Brock, I'm JJJ.

5785
04:59:15,660 --> 04:59:18,380
I watch his podcast.

5786
04:59:25,240 --> 04:59:27,440
Somebody doc Spiderman now.

5787
04:59:32,300 --> 04:59:34,580
I don't want photos of Spiderman.

5788
04:59:34,800 --> 04:59:36,860
I want a doc Spiderman.

5789
04:59:46,220 --> 04:59:49,120
We don't have a lot of heals here, so...

5790
04:59:53,240 --> 04:59:55,660
I'm definitely- I'm down.

5791
05:00:00,760 --> 05:00:02,160
Jesus Christ.

5792
05:00:03,840 --> 05:00:04,420
I'm okay.

5793
05:00:10,580 --> 05:00:12,340
I have a magic on me now.

5794
05:00:12,560 --> 05:00:14,180
I have magic and Spiderman on me.

5795
05:00:18,980 --> 05:00:20,880
I'm just gonna down point.

5796
05:00:23,340 --> 05:00:24,700
Oh my god.

5797
05:00:25,200 --> 05:00:28,860
I need Spiderman social security number.

5798
05:00:31,740 --> 05:00:34,540
And you know where the Spiderman lives.

5799
05:00:35,100 --> 05:00:36,860
Where the fuck does he live?

5800
05:00:38,180 --> 05:00:38,560
Hahaha.

5801
05:00:48,130 --> 05:00:48,930
Okay.

5802
05:00:49,710 --> 05:00:51,910
Oh my god, that magic is so low.

5803
05:00:56,400 --> 05:00:57,140
Oh no.

5804
05:00:59,240 --> 05:01:00,120
Uh, magic sleep.

5805
05:01:01,820 --> 05:01:02,180
Alright.

5806
05:01:03,560 --> 05:01:05,160
Jesus Christ.

5807
05:01:08,820 --> 05:01:09,620
Please.

5808
05:01:10,220 --> 05:01:11,560
How many times?

5809
05:01:13,880 --> 05:01:15,500
Oh my god.

5810
05:01:16,740 --> 05:01:19,580
Okay, I'm messing with the amazing Spiderman.

5811
05:01:19,760 --> 05:01:20,640
Where did he go?

5812
05:01:21,580 --> 05:01:24,060
No, I don't want to mess with him anymore.

5813
05:01:25,520 --> 05:01:26,660
Please, how many?

5814
05:01:27,160 --> 05:01:28,860
How many times?

5815
05:01:30,200 --> 05:01:31,140
Get him out.

5816
05:01:39,050 --> 05:01:40,650
Holy fuck.

5817
05:01:42,030 --> 05:01:43,790
Somebody stop him.

5818
05:01:44,850 --> 05:01:45,490
Sorry.

5819
05:01:46,290 --> 05:01:47,830
Kill him with fire.

5820
05:01:48,850 --> 05:01:50,130
Somebody please.

5821
05:01:51,330 --> 05:01:53,170
Kill him with fire.

5822
05:01:57,730 --> 05:01:58,530
Oh my god.

5823
05:02:02,090 --> 05:02:02,850
Spiderman is half.

5824
05:02:07,810 --> 05:02:09,210
Oh, I couldn't sleep it.

5825
05:02:09,330 --> 05:02:10,170
I saw it.

5826
05:02:10,270 --> 05:02:13,090
I saw it too and I couldn't sleep it.

5827
05:02:13,970 --> 05:02:15,550
I was so ready.

5828
05:02:15,550 --> 05:02:17,830
I had my shift key up.

5829
05:02:18,730 --> 05:02:20,170
And everything.

5830
05:02:21,270 --> 05:02:23,170
My shift key was up.

5831
05:02:25,510 --> 05:02:27,350
Oh my god, I run.

5832
05:02:28,210 --> 05:02:29,170
I run now.

5833
05:02:30,450 --> 05:02:34,150
Oh, this is awkward.

5834
05:02:34,330 --> 05:02:38,310
I don't even think we have enough heals for triple take.

5835
05:02:38,890 --> 05:02:40,770
Oh my god.

5836
05:02:41,190 --> 05:02:42,090
Spiderman to my left.

5837
05:02:45,550 --> 05:02:48,310
Guys, we don't have the heals for triple take.

5838
05:02:48,690 --> 05:02:50,470
They banned Luna.

5839
05:02:54,350 --> 05:02:56,370
They banned Luna.

5840
05:02:56,530 --> 05:02:58,490
If we had Luna, I would understand.

5841
05:03:05,490 --> 05:03:07,010
Alright, nice.

5842
05:03:08,310 --> 05:03:08,790
Nice.

5843
05:03:10,790 --> 05:03:14,550
Honestly, if Luna wasn't banned, I would understand triple take.

5844
05:03:15,550 --> 05:03:18,170
So like, what do you want us to do at that point?

5845
05:03:18,570 --> 05:03:20,230
What do you want us to do?

5846
05:03:24,110 --> 05:03:25,030
Oh my god.

5847
05:03:25,070 --> 05:03:26,610
I can feel...

5848
05:03:26,610 --> 05:03:29,170
I can feel the Spiderman coming in.

5849
05:03:30,270 --> 05:03:31,850
He's so fucking ready.

5850
05:03:32,630 --> 05:03:33,970
He's so fucking ready.

5851
05:03:33,970 --> 05:03:36,010
To jump on me right now.

5852
05:03:36,810 --> 05:03:38,050
He's so ready.

5853
05:03:38,210 --> 05:03:39,450
He's like, oh my god.

5854
05:03:39,550 --> 05:03:41,750
Look at this juicy support right here.

5855
05:03:42,430 --> 05:03:45,490
I used my sleep just to kill that guy.

5856
05:03:45,910 --> 05:03:47,030
Just so you know.

5857
05:03:49,050 --> 05:03:50,010
He runs behind us.

5858
05:03:53,450 --> 05:03:55,110
Oh my god.

5859
05:03:56,130 --> 05:03:57,730
Guys, you don't understand, I have trauma.

5860
05:03:58,330 --> 05:03:59,410
I've been like...

5861
05:03:59,410 --> 05:04:00,670
Fucking...

5862
05:04:00,670 --> 05:04:03,670
I've been getting fucked over by so many...

5863
05:04:03,670 --> 05:04:05,910
By so many Spidermans.

5864
05:04:09,650 --> 05:04:10,290
Like...

5865
05:04:10,290 --> 05:04:11,330
You don't understand.

5866
05:04:11,690 --> 05:04:12,150
It's...

5867
05:04:12,150 --> 05:04:13,510
It's not good for me.

5868
05:04:14,130 --> 05:04:15,830
It's not good.

5869
05:04:16,790 --> 05:04:18,490
I had to walk up.

5870
05:04:18,630 --> 05:04:19,390
Because we're down.

5871
05:04:19,630 --> 05:04:20,730
We're down one.

5872
05:04:21,430 --> 05:04:25,430
Oh my god.

5873
05:04:26,610 --> 05:04:28,250
Oh my god.

5874
05:04:28,350 --> 05:04:29,530
I fucking...

5875
05:04:29,530 --> 05:04:32,730
I don't want to mess with the amazing Spiderman.

5876
05:04:32,950 --> 05:04:34,010
Who said I did?

5877
05:04:34,010 --> 05:04:36,630
I never wanted to.

5878
05:04:39,870 --> 05:04:41,310
Please, I don't have heals.

5879
05:04:41,950 --> 05:04:42,270
Please.

5880
05:04:42,890 --> 05:04:44,910
I don't have enough heals here.

5881
05:04:47,730 --> 05:04:49,750
I don't have heals.

5882
05:04:52,810 --> 05:04:55,230
Oh my god, he did it.

5883
05:04:56,930 --> 05:04:58,630
Oh my god, we did it.

5884
05:04:59,390 --> 05:05:02,330
You said toxin.

5885
05:05:02,710 --> 05:05:05,250
He deserves it.

5886
05:05:13,490 --> 05:05:15,770
I was trying to sleep.

5887
05:05:18,290 --> 05:05:20,650
Oh my god, the fucking ox.

5888
05:05:21,070 --> 05:05:22,690
Somebody kill the ox.

5889
05:05:25,510 --> 05:05:26,070
Yes.

5890
05:05:27,010 --> 05:05:28,210
Oh my god.

5891
05:05:28,250 --> 05:05:29,190
He has ult.

5892
05:05:33,360 --> 05:05:34,220
Oh my god.

5893
05:05:34,260 --> 05:05:35,500
Do we have enough time?

5894
05:05:36,080 --> 05:05:36,960
I'm 76.

5895
05:05:37,220 --> 05:05:40,440
I don't have enough time for build ult unless...

5896
05:05:42,360 --> 05:05:42,920
Unless...

5897
05:05:43,560 --> 05:05:44,460
Oh my god.

5898
05:05:44,620 --> 05:05:45,100
Push cart.

5899
05:05:45,220 --> 05:05:45,800
Push cart.

5900
05:05:45,960 --> 05:05:46,220
Yes.

5901
05:05:49,840 --> 05:05:50,660
I'm trying.

5902
05:05:53,360 --> 05:05:54,000
Magics one.

5903
05:05:54,180 --> 05:05:54,560
Magics one.

5904
05:05:58,800 --> 05:06:00,720
Oh my god.

5905
05:06:04,680 --> 05:06:05,680
Had him.

5906
05:06:05,780 --> 05:06:05,960
Had him.

5907
05:06:08,780 --> 05:06:10,720
They have a lot of ults coming in.

5908
05:06:15,990 --> 05:06:17,250
Oh my god.

5909
05:06:17,290 --> 05:06:18,250
I'm freaking out.

5910
05:06:18,350 --> 05:06:19,570
I'm going to stand on this.

5911
05:06:19,730 --> 05:06:20,650
I'm scared.

5912
05:06:20,650 --> 05:06:21,670
Oh.

5913
05:06:27,150 --> 05:06:31,150
I feel like mantis ult is more value, isn't it?

5914
05:06:32,950 --> 05:06:33,710
Oh.

5915
05:06:34,670 --> 05:06:35,550
Oh.

5916
05:06:38,470 --> 05:06:40,650
Oh, this is...

5917
05:06:42,350 --> 05:06:44,450
Oh, not the moon.

5918
05:06:46,690 --> 05:06:48,870
Oh no, he got...

5919
05:06:50,830 --> 05:06:52,770
I did that.

5920
05:06:53,910 --> 05:06:54,830
Oh my god.

5921
05:06:55,150 --> 05:06:56,350
Please be born again.

5922
05:06:58,950 --> 05:07:00,630
Not Spiderman.

5923
05:07:00,950 --> 05:07:01,670
No.

5924
05:07:02,430 --> 05:07:04,850
They did born again.

5925
05:07:10,190 --> 05:07:12,910
The current score is...

5926
05:07:12,910 --> 05:07:14,010
3, 2, 1.

5927
05:07:14,310 --> 05:07:16,550
Amazing Spiderman.

5928
05:07:17,330 --> 05:07:18,950
Time to switch things up.

5929
05:07:18,950 --> 05:07:21,090
It is what it is.

5930
05:07:26,630 --> 05:07:29,130
It is what it is.

5931
05:07:29,430 --> 05:07:34,930
It is winnable, technically.

5932
05:07:35,590 --> 05:07:36,950
It can be.

5933
05:07:37,170 --> 05:07:39,410
It can be winnable.

5934
05:07:45,060 --> 05:07:46,780
Oh my god.

5935
05:07:46,780 --> 05:07:46,860
Oh my god.

5936
05:07:50,760 --> 05:07:53,220
Guys, why did you have to root for Team Wavy?

5937
05:07:53,400 --> 05:07:57,740
Guys, do you not want me to be happy?

5938
05:08:00,320 --> 05:08:01,480
Damn, that's...

5939
05:08:02,800 --> 05:08:04,720
That's emotional manipulation.

5940
05:08:05,480 --> 05:08:08,360
Guys, you don't want me to be happy?

5941
05:08:09,460 --> 05:08:10,980
Don't you want me...

5942
05:08:10,980 --> 05:08:11,380
No.

5943
05:08:18,720 --> 05:08:19,520
Yes, that's right.

5944
05:08:19,580 --> 05:08:21,860
I'm gonna emotionally manipulate you guys.

5945
05:08:21,980 --> 05:08:22,820
That's fucking right.

5946
05:08:23,120 --> 05:08:24,120
I'm gonna do it.

5947
05:08:31,840 --> 05:08:33,160
Wavy, it's time to throw.

5948
05:08:34,440 --> 05:08:35,460
It's time to throw.

5949
05:08:37,560 --> 05:08:37,900
Alright.

5950
05:08:41,320 --> 05:08:41,560
Alright.

5951
05:08:43,200 --> 05:08:43,740
This is fun.

5952
05:08:43,860 --> 05:08:44,880
Are we actually TPing?

5953
05:08:45,220 --> 05:08:46,460
It didn't work last time.

5954
05:08:46,460 --> 05:08:46,940
Okay, he's down.

5955
05:08:48,500 --> 05:08:49,120
He's dead.

5956
05:08:50,320 --> 05:08:50,520
Let's go.

5957
05:08:50,620 --> 05:08:51,020
Push, push, push.

5958
05:08:54,840 --> 05:08:55,720
It's worth it.

5959
05:08:56,860 --> 05:08:57,700
Oh my god.

5960
05:08:57,760 --> 05:08:58,400
I fucking...

5961
05:08:58,400 --> 05:08:59,280
I gamed there.

5962
05:08:59,700 --> 05:09:01,400
I actually fucking gamed there.

5963
05:09:02,480 --> 05:09:03,580
Spiderman is going to be back now.

5964
05:09:05,300 --> 05:09:05,820
Oh god.

5965
05:09:06,140 --> 05:09:06,700
Madness is low.

5966
05:09:12,020 --> 05:09:12,800
They're all low.

5967
05:09:12,920 --> 05:09:13,680
I might be dead though.

5968
05:09:13,680 --> 05:09:14,220
I have a...

5969
05:09:14,220 --> 05:09:16,100
I have a magic on me.

5970
05:09:16,540 --> 05:09:17,600
I have no heals.

5971
05:09:24,740 --> 05:09:28,480
I'm gonna shield up.

5972
05:09:33,130 --> 05:09:33,930
Moonlight is low.

5973
05:09:35,830 --> 05:09:36,190
We got the point.

5974
05:09:37,550 --> 05:09:38,670
We can't get off point.

5975
05:09:40,610 --> 05:09:41,330
I need help.

5976
05:09:41,410 --> 05:09:41,790
I need help.

5977
05:09:41,790 --> 05:09:42,010
Oh.

5978
05:09:44,110 --> 05:09:46,030
I was so low.

5979
05:09:48,270 --> 05:09:50,230
I was so low.

5980
05:09:51,250 --> 05:09:53,610
We just didn't have enough heals.

5981
05:09:55,510 --> 05:09:56,550
We can touch point.

5982
05:09:56,650 --> 05:09:57,390
I have ult soon.

5983
05:10:04,050 --> 05:10:05,910
I'm playing pretty from point.

5984
05:10:05,910 --> 05:10:08,290
We are undefeatable.

5985
05:10:09,390 --> 05:10:09,610
Nice.

5986
05:10:13,330 --> 05:10:15,150
I'm not gonna play on point.

5987
05:10:19,850 --> 05:10:21,070
She's down there.

5988
05:10:21,810 --> 05:10:22,050
Alright.

5989
05:10:24,910 --> 05:10:27,530
Guys, every time they jump, I have a little heart attack.

5990
05:10:27,990 --> 05:10:28,430
Spiderman behind.

5991
05:10:28,630 --> 05:10:29,930
Spiderman got him.

5992
05:10:36,630 --> 05:10:38,310
I have damage boosting you.

5993
05:10:38,310 --> 05:10:39,050
Starlord.

5994
05:10:44,410 --> 05:10:45,630
I'm backing out now.

5995
05:10:52,990 --> 05:10:54,630
Oh no.

5996
05:10:56,210 --> 05:10:56,810
I'm ulting this.

5997
05:10:59,510 --> 05:11:00,130
Their guy was changed.

5998
05:11:00,350 --> 05:11:01,570
Get changed.

5999
05:11:04,110 --> 05:11:04,930
Nice.

6000
05:11:07,430 --> 05:11:07,910
I'm at him.

6001
05:11:08,270 --> 05:11:09,390
At him low.

6002
05:11:11,130 --> 05:11:11,950
Oh.

6003
05:11:13,650 --> 05:11:15,070
I'm backing out.

6004
05:11:16,490 --> 05:11:18,010
I don't wanna.

6005
05:11:18,410 --> 05:11:21,390
I don't wanna get fucked over here.

6006
05:11:23,650 --> 05:11:24,910
I'm scared.

6007
05:11:25,730 --> 05:11:26,630
I'm so scared.

6008
05:11:28,730 --> 05:11:29,970
I'm so scared.

6009
05:11:30,690 --> 05:11:31,550
Spiderman's low.

6010
05:11:33,710 --> 05:11:35,030
I'm cocooning.

6011
05:11:36,730 --> 05:11:37,090
I got him.

6012
05:11:42,990 --> 05:11:44,790
Oh my god.

6013
05:11:44,830 --> 05:11:45,250
You know.

6014
05:11:45,490 --> 05:11:47,550
That's everything.

6015
05:11:48,250 --> 05:11:48,830
That's actually.

6016
05:11:50,130 --> 05:11:51,550
The moon.

6017
05:11:52,890 --> 05:11:53,730
Yeah, that's.

6018
05:11:54,070 --> 05:11:55,690
Yeah, I wasn't.

6019
05:11:55,750 --> 05:11:57,690
I wasn't gonna live that.

6020
05:12:02,610 --> 05:12:04,210
Yeah, that was.

6021
05:12:04,430 --> 05:12:06,110
That was pretty rough.

6022
05:12:07,090 --> 05:12:07,810
For us.

6023
05:12:09,810 --> 05:12:10,570
Just.

6024
05:12:11,230 --> 05:12:11,690
Just be like.

6025
05:12:11,870 --> 05:12:12,730
Just use everything.

6026
05:12:13,130 --> 05:12:13,910
It's just fine.

6027
05:12:14,090 --> 05:12:14,190
Just.

6028
05:12:14,470 --> 05:12:22,650
Just use everything.

6029
05:12:30,420 --> 05:12:31,180
Sorry.

6030
05:12:31,180 --> 05:12:31,900
Get off.

6031
05:12:37,920 --> 05:12:40,340
If you don't swap.

6032
05:12:40,820 --> 05:12:42,260
I'm not buying.

6033
05:12:46,140 --> 05:12:48,640
I'm legit doing it.

6034
05:12:55,080 --> 05:12:57,080
Not that hard to understand.

6035
05:12:57,440 --> 05:12:58,980
Your logic pains me.

6036
05:12:58,980 --> 05:12:59,600
How?

6037
05:13:02,880 --> 05:13:05,660
How did we get here?

6038
05:13:05,740 --> 05:13:07,140
It's the first game.

6039
05:13:09,420 --> 05:13:10,760
I'm not even gonna argue with the brick wall.

6040
05:13:11,180 --> 05:13:13,660
The stack is already falling apart.

6041
05:13:13,880 --> 05:13:15,020
It's the first game.

6042
05:13:15,020 --> 05:13:16,840
I'll never be youtuber shroud.

6043
05:13:17,380 --> 05:13:20,560
I'll never be youtuber shroud.

6044
05:13:21,620 --> 05:13:21,880
At least.

6045
05:13:22,460 --> 05:13:24,620
The stack at least stays together.

6046
05:13:24,800 --> 05:13:26,740
My stack just fights each other.

6047
05:13:26,740 --> 05:13:28,200
I'm like not even the glue.

6048
05:13:28,420 --> 05:13:31,680
I'm not even the glue to hold people to get through.

6049
05:13:31,880 --> 05:13:32,240
I'm just.

6050
05:13:32,680 --> 05:13:34,600
I'm just like trying.

6051
05:13:35,680 --> 05:13:36,920
Trying to make it.

6052
05:13:44,860 --> 05:13:45,460
Nice.

6053
05:13:50,600 --> 05:13:52,900
Everybody is falling apart.

6054
05:13:53,380 --> 05:13:55,180
What do I do guys?

6055
05:13:59,420 --> 05:14:01,540
Oh my god.

6056
05:14:02,040 --> 05:14:02,520
Oh my god.

6057
05:14:02,520 --> 05:14:03,900
How is he dead?

6058
05:14:12,060 --> 05:14:13,280
I'm okay.

6059
05:14:17,240 --> 05:14:20,600
Everything is okay.

6060
05:14:24,360 --> 05:14:28,540
I don't even want to stay close to people.

6061
05:14:30,600 --> 05:14:31,320
He goes.

6062
05:14:37,340 --> 05:14:38,560
Not the moon.

6063
05:14:39,420 --> 05:14:40,600
Not the moon.

6064
05:14:41,560 --> 05:14:43,100
Oh my god.

6065
05:14:44,020 --> 05:14:45,660
I can't see anything.

6066
05:14:48,600 --> 05:14:48,800
No.

6067
05:14:51,980 --> 05:14:53,680
There's two DPS behind us.

6068
05:14:55,720 --> 05:14:56,380
It's okay.

6069
05:14:57,220 --> 05:14:59,260
I cocooned in the middle.

6070
05:14:59,400 --> 05:15:00,800
What's the worst that could happen?

6071
05:15:03,540 --> 05:15:04,820
Magic, magic one.

6072
05:15:05,860 --> 05:15:07,460
Oh my god.

6073
05:15:11,750 --> 05:15:13,250
Oh my god.

6074
05:15:15,130 --> 05:15:15,810
Spiderman.

6075
05:15:16,110 --> 05:15:17,390
In your character.

6076
05:15:17,810 --> 05:15:18,110
Jeez.

6077
05:15:19,710 --> 05:15:21,050
Oh my god.

6078
05:15:22,970 --> 05:15:23,850
What happened?

6079
05:15:24,030 --> 05:15:26,470
I don't even know what the fuck happened.

6080
05:15:32,450 --> 05:15:33,190
Alright.

6081
05:15:33,370 --> 05:15:33,510
Alright, Lao.

6082
05:15:33,730 --> 05:15:34,890
Congrats, Lao.

6083
05:15:35,610 --> 05:15:37,190
You won your audition.

6084
05:15:38,150 --> 05:15:39,810
But Q times are ass.

6085
05:15:40,250 --> 05:15:40,930
Are ass.

6086
05:15:42,190 --> 05:15:43,170
Oh wait.

6087
05:15:44,030 --> 05:15:45,410
Congratulations, Lao.

6088
05:15:46,590 --> 05:15:48,810
You won your audition.

6089
05:15:49,770 --> 05:15:51,350
But Q times are ass.

6090
05:15:52,110 --> 05:15:53,470
Times are bad.

6091
05:15:53,990 --> 05:15:54,970
We'll call you.

6092
05:16:02,830 --> 05:16:03,790
Okay.

6093
05:16:10,330 --> 05:16:12,210
I'm sorry, Lao.

6094
05:16:12,370 --> 05:16:12,950
I can't.

6095
05:16:13,050 --> 05:16:16,270
I cannot wait 10 minutes.

6096
05:16:16,770 --> 05:16:18,630
For a Q time.

6097
05:16:22,110 --> 05:16:23,130
Oh my god.

6098
05:16:23,130 --> 05:16:24,270
I'm proud.

6099
05:16:24,550 --> 05:16:28,590
Oh my god.

6100
05:16:32,550 --> 05:16:36,730
Oh my god.

6101
05:16:38,090 --> 05:16:39,410
Lao, we're so...

6102
05:16:40,090 --> 05:16:41,950
We're so proud of you, Lao.

6103
05:16:42,050 --> 05:16:42,630
You won.

6104
05:16:42,990 --> 05:16:44,110
He is better.

6105
05:16:45,170 --> 05:16:46,710
Oh my god, it's so much faster.

6106
05:16:47,510 --> 05:16:50,970
The Q times are actually so much faster.

6107
05:16:53,330 --> 05:16:55,250
Huge shoutout to Lao.

6108
05:16:56,830 --> 05:16:59,130
Huge shoutout to Lao for...

6109
05:17:00,630 --> 05:17:03,110
For winning the audition.

6110
05:17:04,030 --> 05:17:05,030
He won.

6111
05:17:05,230 --> 05:17:06,410
But he lost.

6112
05:17:06,910 --> 05:17:09,330
He won the audition, guys.

6113
05:17:09,890 --> 05:17:10,890
Huge shoutout to him.

6114
05:17:12,470 --> 05:17:14,610
Now, reject Wavy's friend request.

6115
05:17:17,470 --> 05:17:20,450
Oh, because JTurtle?

6116
05:17:20,450 --> 05:17:22,570
I'm fine with that.

6117
05:17:22,690 --> 05:17:23,310
Sure.

6118
05:17:26,050 --> 05:17:27,250
Lao is now...

6119
05:17:27,250 --> 05:17:30,630
Now will be a regular tank stacker with us.

6120
05:17:32,730 --> 05:17:34,010
Don't worry, Lao.

6121
05:17:34,170 --> 05:17:36,270
Because you won the tank audition.

6122
05:17:36,950 --> 05:17:38,930
I will reject Wavy's...

6123
05:17:38,930 --> 05:17:41,070
I will reject Wavy's friend request.

6124
05:17:41,950 --> 05:17:43,750
Team Wavy!

6125
05:17:50,810 --> 05:17:51,390
No!

6126
05:17:52,330 --> 05:17:54,270
Justice for Wavy!

6127
05:17:58,290 --> 05:18:00,450
Crying for Wavy right now.

6128
05:18:03,010 --> 05:18:04,210
Alright, I'll play Adam.

6129
05:18:04,450 --> 05:18:05,950
Now it's my turn to play Adam.

6130
05:18:06,470 --> 05:18:07,490
He had his shot.

6131
05:18:07,910 --> 05:18:09,370
He didn't even know he was auditioning.

6132
05:18:11,730 --> 05:18:12,990
He didn't even know.

6133
05:18:13,430 --> 05:18:14,370
He could've...

6134
05:18:14,370 --> 05:18:16,770
If he knew he would give up his ult.

6135
05:18:16,770 --> 05:18:18,210
But he didn't even know.

6136
05:18:22,700 --> 05:18:26,600
It louder performs next time we audition Wavy next.

6137
05:18:31,930 --> 05:18:33,090
Where's the Adam DPS tech?

6138
05:18:33,150 --> 05:18:34,170
What's the Adam DPS tech?

6139
05:18:34,610 --> 05:18:36,110
People are coming up with new tech everyday.

6140
05:18:37,330 --> 05:18:38,350
I have no idea.

6141
05:18:39,390 --> 05:18:40,170
Are we playing this map?

6142
05:18:40,310 --> 05:18:41,150
Fucking hell!

6143
05:18:41,410 --> 05:18:42,310
This map again?

6144
05:18:44,010 --> 05:18:44,910
What is it?

6145
05:18:45,250 --> 05:18:46,210
Dude, there's literally...

6146
05:18:46,210 --> 05:18:47,650
There's tech everyday.

6147
05:18:47,650 --> 05:18:48,890
I can't keep up.

6148
05:18:49,830 --> 05:18:53,090
You mash left and right click and he attacks faster?

6149
05:18:54,310 --> 05:18:56,070
Is that...

6150
05:18:56,070 --> 05:18:58,310
It feels the same.

6151
05:18:59,390 --> 05:19:00,590
Like this?

6152
05:19:02,530 --> 05:19:03,410
Oh!

6153
05:19:03,950 --> 05:19:05,470
Oh yeah!

6154
05:19:05,770 --> 05:19:06,090
Okay.

6155
05:19:06,830 --> 05:19:08,590
Is that what you mean?

6156
05:19:11,430 --> 05:19:12,430
Like that?

6157
05:19:13,390 --> 05:19:13,830
Yeah.

6158
05:19:13,830 --> 05:19:14,950
Don't do that.

6159
05:19:15,430 --> 05:19:16,290
Okay, that's scary.

6160
05:19:16,950 --> 05:19:18,030
That's scary.

6161
05:19:18,870 --> 05:19:19,870
That's scary.

6162
05:19:22,690 --> 05:19:23,330
Alright.

6163
05:19:28,160 --> 05:19:28,800
Okay.

6164
05:19:29,240 --> 05:19:30,240
I should stop that.

6165
05:19:31,940 --> 05:19:34,320
I don't think I can keep up with that tech though.

6166
05:19:35,120 --> 05:19:37,360
I don't think I can...

6167
05:19:37,980 --> 05:19:42,200
I don't think I should try and use that tech because like...

6168
05:19:42,200 --> 05:19:44,200
Oh my god, he already...

6169
05:19:46,440 --> 05:19:48,420
Oh my god, he used the health pack.

6170
05:19:49,280 --> 05:19:52,180
I don't want to waste my heals because it's like...

6171
05:19:52,180 --> 05:19:55,660
It's so limited that like, I don't know.

6172
05:19:58,320 --> 05:19:58,980
That would be fast.

6173
05:20:00,320 --> 05:20:01,520
Oh my god, he's so low!

6174
05:20:02,000 --> 05:20:04,360
Okay, now I can't waste my heals though.

6175
05:20:07,440 --> 05:20:08,600
Oh my god.

6176
05:20:14,280 --> 05:20:14,920
Okay.

6177
05:20:18,190 --> 05:20:20,330
Oh my god, we're trying our best.

6178
05:20:20,510 --> 05:20:22,790
Be careful, you have limited heals with this.

6179
05:20:24,250 --> 05:20:25,670
Oh my god!

6180
05:20:26,310 --> 05:20:27,370
There we go!

6181
05:20:30,230 --> 05:20:31,830
Oh my god.

6182
05:20:33,150 --> 05:20:33,790
Yeah.

6183
05:20:35,910 --> 05:20:37,250
I might as well...

6184
05:20:37,250 --> 05:20:38,570
Oh my god, okay guys.

6185
05:20:38,850 --> 05:20:40,430
I'm gonna go Loki.

6186
05:20:41,650 --> 05:20:43,130
There we go!

6187
05:20:43,490 --> 05:20:44,730
Here we go!

6188
05:20:45,190 --> 05:20:46,930
It's Loki time!

6189
05:20:48,270 --> 05:20:49,930
I'm so bad with Loki but we'll learn.

6190
05:20:50,650 --> 05:20:54,410
If we throw, we'll go Cloak and Dagger because I'm not that confident with Loki.

6191
05:20:56,690 --> 05:20:58,390
I'm actually like, not a Loki.

6192
05:20:58,490 --> 05:20:59,910
I barely play Loki.

6193
05:21:05,270 --> 05:21:06,170
Okay.

6194
05:21:07,250 --> 05:21:07,930
Okay.

6195
05:21:07,930 --> 05:21:09,010
I gotta heal!

6196
05:21:09,270 --> 05:21:10,050
I'm healing!

6197
05:21:10,410 --> 05:21:11,150
I'm healing!

6198
05:21:11,430 --> 05:21:12,170
I'm healing!

6199
05:21:16,470 --> 05:21:19,230
I know my clone's healing him.

6200
05:21:19,990 --> 05:21:20,850
I'm healing!

6201
05:21:21,410 --> 05:21:22,170
Let's go!

6202
05:21:22,810 --> 05:21:24,910
Let's go, do your thing!

6203
05:21:25,530 --> 05:21:26,430
Yippee!

6204
05:21:26,430 --> 05:21:27,830
You know what?

6205
05:21:27,910 --> 05:21:29,410
You go do your thing!

6206
05:21:30,110 --> 05:21:32,610
Go clones, go!

6207
05:21:36,650 --> 05:21:39,030
There we go.

6208
05:21:45,230 --> 05:21:48,090
Oh my god!

6209
05:21:48,090 --> 05:21:48,850
Oh my god!

6210
05:21:52,770 --> 05:21:55,610
I didn't know where my clone is!

6211
05:21:55,710 --> 05:21:56,590
It was a hellmate!

6212
05:21:57,690 --> 05:21:59,550
It was actually a hellmate!

6213
05:22:02,470 --> 05:22:03,390
Okay.

6214
05:22:03,830 --> 05:22:06,350
Let me...

6215
05:22:06,350 --> 05:22:06,610
Alright.

6216
05:22:07,570 --> 05:22:07,990
There we go.

6217
05:22:09,410 --> 05:22:10,610
I'mma sneak.

6218
05:22:11,070 --> 05:22:12,370
I live!

6219
05:22:13,470 --> 05:22:14,930
Holy shit!

6220
05:22:14,930 --> 05:22:17,390
Oh my god!

6221
05:22:17,510 --> 05:22:18,390
That was...

6222
05:22:18,590 --> 05:22:20,290
What a gamble!

6223
05:22:20,870 --> 05:22:22,630
It really was...

6224
05:22:22,630 --> 05:22:24,410
We got moon knighted.

6225
05:22:25,930 --> 05:22:28,650
What a fucking gamble!

6226
05:22:28,750 --> 05:22:29,610
It worked though!

6227
05:22:30,730 --> 05:22:31,610
He had no support.

6228
05:22:32,310 --> 05:22:33,330
It worked.

6229
05:22:34,090 --> 05:22:35,290
It actually worked.

6230
05:22:35,510 --> 05:22:36,670
Holy shit.

6231
05:22:36,970 --> 05:22:37,550
But we're dead.

6232
05:22:37,650 --> 05:22:38,350
But it worked!

6233
05:22:38,730 --> 05:22:39,570
But we're dead.

6234
05:22:39,910 --> 05:22:40,790
But it worked!

6235
05:22:41,650 --> 05:22:42,730
Oh no.

6236
05:22:44,930 --> 05:22:45,890
We're dead.

6237
05:22:46,390 --> 05:22:47,290
But it worked.

6238
05:22:48,930 --> 05:22:51,110
Guys, we might be dead.

6239
05:22:52,550 --> 05:22:53,810
But it worked.

6240
05:22:56,270 --> 05:22:57,290
Oh my god.

6241
05:22:57,530 --> 05:22:58,490
But it didn't work.

6242
05:22:59,450 --> 05:23:00,010
For a sec.

6243
05:23:04,670 --> 05:23:05,670
Oh my god.

6244
05:23:06,430 --> 05:23:07,930
There's a Psylocke behind us.

6245
05:23:10,150 --> 05:23:11,330
Oh my god, please.

6246
05:23:15,190 --> 05:23:16,070
Oh shit!

6247
05:23:17,210 --> 05:23:18,890
Where did he come from?

6248
05:23:19,950 --> 05:23:21,270
He was behind!

6249
05:23:23,810 --> 05:23:25,550
Oh, that's a grid all up though.

6250
05:23:26,190 --> 05:23:27,250
That's why I didn't need me.

6251
05:23:33,470 --> 05:23:34,550
The Hawkeye's weak.

6252
05:23:38,490 --> 05:23:40,290
Guys, don't learn from my Loki plays.

6253
05:23:40,390 --> 05:23:41,810
I'm literally learning on the spot right now.

6254
05:23:45,510 --> 05:23:46,410
Hawkeye one.

6255
05:23:48,070 --> 05:23:48,750
Alright.

6256
05:23:49,390 --> 05:23:50,650
You live through this.

6257
05:23:51,430 --> 05:23:52,090
Know that.

6258
05:24:02,240 --> 05:24:03,460
There's a Psylocke behind.

6259
05:24:04,760 --> 05:24:05,280
I have one.

6260
05:24:06,080 --> 05:24:06,460
I'm low.

6261
05:24:07,860 --> 05:24:09,120
Oh, there is Psy.

6262
05:24:11,300 --> 05:24:12,380
Don't worry.

6263
05:24:12,380 --> 05:24:12,440
Don't worry.

6264
05:24:16,360 --> 05:24:17,120
Please.

6265
05:24:18,260 --> 05:24:19,020
Please.

6266
05:24:19,960 --> 05:24:20,720
Please.

6267
05:24:21,880 --> 05:24:24,640
Oh, get that clone in there and heal!

6268
05:24:26,160 --> 05:24:29,580
Mag, mag, mag.

6269
05:24:29,600 --> 05:24:30,840
It's gonna work!

6270
05:24:31,500 --> 05:24:33,340
I'm learning on the spot!

6271
05:24:34,380 --> 05:24:35,020
Psylocke on me.

6272
05:24:35,020 --> 05:24:35,180
Oh, fuck.

6273
05:24:40,340 --> 05:24:41,260
Don't worry!

6274
05:24:45,060 --> 05:24:46,840
Oh, we're so healthy!

6275
05:24:48,080 --> 05:24:49,440
We're so healthy!

6276
05:24:50,800 --> 05:24:51,620
Where's my other clone?

6277
05:24:51,860 --> 05:24:52,640
Where did he go?

6278
05:24:52,720 --> 05:24:53,380
Oh, he's dead.

6279
05:24:55,160 --> 05:24:56,840
Oh, there's someone to my left!

6280
05:25:00,860 --> 05:25:02,540
Oh my god, who shot me?

6281
05:25:05,020 --> 05:25:05,600
Where's my Mantis?

6282
05:25:05,740 --> 05:25:07,320
Okay, I have to look at my Mantis.

6283
05:25:08,700 --> 05:25:09,780
There's someone on our Mantis.

6284
05:25:09,940 --> 05:25:12,440
There's a Hawkeye and a Psylocke.

6285
05:25:15,800 --> 05:25:16,660
This is fine.

6286
05:25:21,340 --> 05:25:22,660
This is fine.

6287
05:25:22,760 --> 05:25:24,120
He never miss.

6288
05:25:24,400 --> 05:25:25,120
But he might miss.

6289
05:25:26,900 --> 05:25:27,980
Oh my god, it's fine.

6290
05:25:28,240 --> 05:25:29,140
That's huge!

6291
05:25:29,820 --> 05:25:31,420
That's fucking huge!

6292
05:25:31,420 --> 05:25:32,500
That's huge!

6293
05:25:32,820 --> 05:25:34,940
See you guys!

6294
05:25:36,360 --> 05:25:41,680
I might be a naturally gifted Loki player as I fucking make every Loki player cry.

6295
05:25:47,770 --> 05:25:52,030
I could be making every Loki player cry watching me right now.

6296
05:25:55,270 --> 05:25:56,470
It hurts!

6297
05:25:57,590 --> 05:25:59,810
Guys, I'm learning as we go along!

6298
05:26:02,890 --> 05:26:03,750
I'm learning!

6299
05:26:04,730 --> 05:26:06,670
I'm doing great, guys!

6300
05:26:06,950 --> 05:26:08,230
I'm doing great!

6301
05:26:09,830 --> 05:26:13,430
Excuse me, this is a GM1 Loki.

6302
05:26:13,990 --> 05:26:15,250
It's understandable.

6303
05:26:20,610 --> 05:26:22,930
See, it's fine.

6304
05:26:23,230 --> 05:26:24,190
It's fine.

6305
05:26:28,730 --> 05:26:29,650
Right?

6306
05:26:33,390 --> 05:26:34,570
It's okay.

6307
05:26:35,810 --> 05:26:36,830
It's alright.

6308
05:26:40,930 --> 05:26:43,550
I'm here for all the Loki mains out there.

6309
05:26:43,970 --> 05:26:46,610
I'm here to represent you.

6310
05:26:51,030 --> 05:26:52,770
What the fuck?

6311
05:26:52,810 --> 05:26:53,770
He would be dead.

6312
05:26:53,910 --> 05:26:54,770
That's a lie.

6313
05:27:01,860 --> 05:27:03,540
He's so thirsty.

6314
05:27:03,540 --> 05:27:05,420
Alright guys, unzip.

6315
05:27:07,760 --> 05:27:09,460
Isn't that the little flower meme?

6316
05:27:11,240 --> 05:27:13,400
Guys, that's the flower meme, right?

6317
05:27:19,660 --> 05:27:21,720
What is that flower meme?

6318
05:27:21,920 --> 05:27:23,120
You're gonna let him die like that?

6319
05:27:23,200 --> 05:27:24,200
You want him to die?

6320
05:27:26,000 --> 05:27:30,060
Guys, he's thirsty!

6321
05:27:30,280 --> 05:27:31,420
You want him to die?

6322
05:27:33,780 --> 05:27:35,380
Say what?

6323
05:27:41,320 --> 05:27:41,720
Alright.

6324
05:27:43,960 --> 05:27:46,680
There's a Captain America here.

6325
05:27:52,780 --> 05:27:53,980
Jesus Christ.

6326
05:27:55,100 --> 05:27:57,140
I'm trying my best here.

6327
05:27:57,940 --> 05:28:00,060
I'm trying my best in this situation.

6328
05:28:00,240 --> 05:28:01,160
This fucked up situation.

6329
05:28:01,580 --> 05:28:02,380
Woah!

6330
05:28:05,100 --> 05:28:06,080
Oh my god.

6331
05:28:07,200 --> 05:28:09,100
Oh, we got a pig.

6332
05:28:09,220 --> 05:28:09,720
Let's go.

6333
05:28:11,580 --> 05:28:13,760
Oh, there's a Captain America on me.

6334
05:28:22,660 --> 05:28:24,000
Here we go.

6335
05:28:24,960 --> 05:28:27,900
This is what Loki does to you.

6336
05:28:30,200 --> 05:28:32,060
You want him to fucking die?

6337
05:28:32,060 --> 05:28:34,420
You probably need to open up in your chat.

6338
05:28:34,520 --> 05:28:35,380
What does that mean?

6339
05:28:39,580 --> 05:28:41,020
Don't worry about it.

6340
05:28:42,140 --> 05:28:43,340
I'm scared, bro.

6341
05:28:44,860 --> 05:28:48,240
He introduced it himself.

6342
05:28:48,740 --> 05:28:49,400
I don't know, bro.

6343
05:28:49,420 --> 05:28:51,820
I just have my fucking chat open and it's telling me that.

6344
05:28:52,060 --> 05:28:52,480
I don't know.

6345
05:28:53,540 --> 05:28:55,400
Don't worry about it.

6346
05:28:55,840 --> 05:28:56,960
Is your chat insane or what?

6347
05:28:58,520 --> 05:28:59,560
Oh my god.

6348
05:29:05,200 --> 05:29:05,680
Alright.

6349
05:29:06,300 --> 05:29:06,920
Don't worry.

6350
05:29:07,180 --> 05:29:09,200
I do that and then like...

6351
05:29:09,200 --> 05:29:10,280
It's like he's actually...

6352
05:29:10,280 --> 05:29:14,340
I don't know where he's shooting, but I think he's healing, right?

6353
05:29:15,260 --> 05:29:16,440
Don't worry, Loki.

6354
05:29:17,420 --> 05:29:19,740
Just pretend you're doing something, my clone.

6355
05:29:20,840 --> 05:29:24,040
If I also stand there and not move, they'll think I'm a clone.

6356
05:29:24,280 --> 05:29:25,260
This is how it works.

6357
05:29:26,020 --> 05:29:27,300
They'll think I'm a clone, right?

6358
05:29:28,340 --> 05:29:29,980
You don't know which one's the real one.

6359
05:29:29,980 --> 05:29:30,980
Oh my god.

6360
05:29:33,780 --> 05:29:35,960
Who's the real one?

6361
05:29:36,180 --> 05:29:37,580
They'll never know.

6362
05:29:38,800 --> 05:29:40,280
Okay, it's me.

6363
05:29:40,660 --> 05:29:41,980
It's actually me.

6364
05:29:43,300 --> 05:29:44,360
You know what?

6365
05:29:54,950 --> 05:29:58,840
Oh shit.

6366
05:29:59,180 --> 05:30:02,080
Oh shit.

6367
05:30:04,060 --> 05:30:04,720
What?

6368
05:30:06,320 --> 05:30:07,720
I did that.

6369
05:30:08,380 --> 05:30:09,940
I killed Jay.

6370
05:30:12,820 --> 05:30:14,320
There we go.

6371
05:30:14,700 --> 05:30:15,980
It's just that easy.

6372
05:30:18,940 --> 05:30:22,060
That is a Loki laugh if I hear one.

6373
05:30:22,460 --> 05:30:24,220
See, I told you guys.

6374
05:30:25,160 --> 05:30:25,720
Guys.

6375
05:30:26,060 --> 05:30:27,260
I told you.

6376
05:30:28,540 --> 05:30:30,820
My Psylocke training will work.

6377
05:30:31,260 --> 05:30:35,220
Guys, my Psylocke training actually pulled through, chat.

6378
05:30:35,700 --> 05:30:40,400
It actually pulled through me playing Psylocke.

6379
05:30:41,860 --> 05:30:43,460
It worked out.

6380
05:30:45,960 --> 05:30:46,880
Jay Turtle.

6381
05:30:48,460 --> 05:30:49,400
How's my rank?

6382
05:30:49,560 --> 05:30:50,460
I do rank from eternity.

6383
05:30:50,960 --> 05:30:51,960
That's how it's been.

6384
05:30:52,180 --> 05:30:53,460
It's been...

6385
05:30:53,460 --> 05:30:57,000
It's been five hours.

6386
05:30:57,420 --> 05:31:00,000
It's been five hours.

6387
05:31:01,020 --> 05:31:02,560
I'm ready to see the plus 17?

6388
05:31:02,760 --> 05:31:03,280
Me too.

6389
05:31:04,180 --> 05:31:05,100
Me too.

6390
05:31:05,260 --> 05:31:06,720
It's getting there.

6391
05:31:10,000 --> 05:31:11,040
I knew it, guys.

6392
05:31:11,660 --> 05:31:12,780
Truly pure cinema.

6393
05:31:13,400 --> 05:31:20,660
I started out trying to fucking play Psylocke in quick play, and then I utilized my Psylocke training for this very moment.

6394
05:31:23,140 --> 05:31:24,500
It's just pure cinema.

6395
05:31:27,270 --> 05:31:28,420
It was worth it.

6396
05:31:28,420 --> 05:31:30,080
That's fucking right.

6397
05:31:30,200 --> 05:31:31,820
It was worth it.

6398
05:31:40,760 --> 05:31:43,580
A five hour long movie.

6399
05:31:51,980 --> 05:31:53,380
Luna?

6400
05:31:54,140 --> 05:31:54,620
Mantis?

6401
05:31:57,700 --> 05:31:59,320
Selfie Mantis?

6402
05:32:04,030 --> 05:32:05,110
That's fine.

6403
05:32:10,190 --> 05:32:11,850
Fan Psylocke?

6404
05:32:11,850 --> 05:32:14,530
We have a Psylocke player.

6405
05:32:18,270 --> 05:32:19,810
Target banning, I guess.

6406
05:32:21,510 --> 05:32:23,650
I just realized my volume was super low.

6407
05:32:24,070 --> 05:32:25,170
I don't know for how long.

6408
05:32:26,690 --> 05:32:29,330
I hope I was audible this entire time.

6409
05:32:29,470 --> 05:32:31,550
I don't know when my audio was super low.

6410
05:32:38,790 --> 05:32:40,010
No, my mic.

6411
05:32:40,510 --> 05:32:41,190
Me talking.

6412
05:32:41,190 --> 05:32:42,290
Oh, it was fine?

6413
05:32:42,450 --> 05:32:42,850
Thank God.

6414
05:32:42,970 --> 05:32:43,190
Okay.

6415
05:32:43,670 --> 05:32:49,070
Cause sometimes when I mute myself on GoXLR, it like, when I unmute myself, it goes down.

6416
05:32:49,570 --> 05:32:51,890
So like, that's why I'm like ah fuck.

6417
05:32:56,110 --> 05:32:57,730
See, I'm fucking flexible.

6418
05:32:58,530 --> 05:33:02,290
I can play any support, except for lowkey, but I played him last game.

6419
05:33:04,710 --> 05:33:05,210
Oh, okay.

6420
05:33:05,290 --> 05:33:05,750
That's good.

6421
05:33:06,090 --> 05:33:11,050
Yeah, it was like, I usually put it at 90, but then I, I when I checked it, it was on 84.

6422
05:33:11,050 --> 05:33:12,290
And I was like, that's not good.

6423
05:33:12,570 --> 05:33:13,830
That's not good.

6424
05:33:16,570 --> 05:33:18,730
Oh shit, my Streamlabs fucking crashed.

6425
05:33:19,810 --> 05:33:21,010
My Streamlabs labels.

6426
05:33:21,210 --> 05:33:23,470
Not the, uh...

6427
05:33:23,470 --> 05:33:25,370
Let me restart my session for this.

6428
05:33:25,730 --> 05:33:27,510
Not my actual Streamlabs.

6429
05:33:27,530 --> 05:33:28,870
I don't use Streamlabs cause...

6430
05:33:28,870 --> 05:33:34,770
Don't use Streamlabs because if you're a streamer, I suggest not using Streamlabs for OBS.

6431
05:33:35,250 --> 05:33:37,080
Because it takes up too much, uh...

6432
05:33:38,190 --> 05:33:38,710
What was it?

6433
05:33:38,710 --> 05:33:39,790
It takes up too much CPU.

6434
05:33:40,270 --> 05:33:41,370
So I just use regular.

6435
05:33:42,670 --> 05:33:44,490
I just use like, OBS.

6436
05:33:44,650 --> 05:33:45,430
Normal OBS.

6437
05:33:48,790 --> 05:33:49,270
Osnavy!

6438
05:33:49,550 --> 05:33:51,170
Thank you for gifting a sub.

6439
05:33:51,290 --> 05:33:52,390
Thank you, thank you.

6440
05:33:52,550 --> 05:33:54,630
And Kazu, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

6441
05:33:54,750 --> 05:33:55,670
Thank you, thank you.

6442
05:34:00,980 --> 05:34:01,460
Whoa.

6443
05:34:02,500 --> 05:34:04,680
How do you know the government name?

6444
05:34:09,760 --> 05:34:10,500
Boop.

6445
05:34:12,660 --> 05:34:14,660
I also have a very tanky PC.

6446
05:34:15,640 --> 05:34:18,260
That which still struggles to fucking handle anything.

6447
05:34:18,620 --> 05:34:19,000
Hahaha.

6448
05:34:26,060 --> 05:34:26,800
Alright.

6449
05:34:27,420 --> 05:34:30,420
I'm a little concerned for our tanks.

6450
05:34:32,100 --> 05:34:33,520
Just a little bit.

6451
05:34:37,780 --> 05:34:38,260
Alright.

6452
05:34:38,260 --> 05:34:39,400
Ooh, that's a lot of tanks.

6453
05:34:39,500 --> 05:34:40,260
I like that.

6454
05:34:40,880 --> 05:34:41,680
But that wasn't me.

6455
05:34:41,780 --> 05:34:43,720
I just realized I wasn't the one that did those.

6456
05:34:44,100 --> 05:34:45,100
God, it like confused me.

6457
05:34:45,120 --> 05:34:47,720
I thought I was fucking dinking people like crazy.

6458
05:34:48,260 --> 05:34:48,700
Hahaha.

6459
05:34:49,240 --> 05:34:51,480
I was like, whoa, I'm fucking insane!

6460
05:34:52,200 --> 05:34:54,140
But it wasn't me.

6461
05:34:58,090 --> 05:35:00,610
When you saw it, it was your own teammate.

6462
05:35:03,210 --> 05:35:05,110
Oh, oh, that's interesting.

6463
05:35:05,810 --> 05:35:06,330
Alright.

6464
05:35:07,790 --> 05:35:08,310
Sure.

6465
05:35:09,330 --> 05:35:11,070
Let me try and build my ult, I guess.

6466
05:35:11,410 --> 05:35:11,490
Hahaha.

6467
05:35:12,950 --> 05:35:13,470
Oh.

6468
05:35:18,410 --> 05:35:21,670
Please hit something so I can build ult charge off of you.

6469
05:35:24,390 --> 05:35:25,590
I'm gonna have to ult this.

6470
05:35:27,730 --> 05:35:28,750
They're gonna have strange ult.

6471
05:35:29,910 --> 05:35:30,310
Go!

6472
05:35:30,310 --> 05:35:30,390
Go!

6473
05:35:32,530 --> 05:35:34,150
I'm so scared.

6474
05:35:34,430 --> 05:35:36,810
Oh my god!

6475
05:35:36,990 --> 05:35:39,450
Oh fucking shit, we're okay.

6476
05:35:42,070 --> 05:35:44,170
Oh, we're not okay.

6477
05:35:45,110 --> 05:35:45,910
We're...

6478
05:35:45,910 --> 05:35:47,530
We're not okay.

6479
05:35:52,050 --> 05:35:53,130
Oh my god.

6480
05:35:54,230 --> 05:35:56,610
We don't have our fucking...

6481
05:35:56,610 --> 05:35:58,570
We don't have our Starlord ult yet.

6482
05:36:00,290 --> 05:36:02,050
Oh, okay.

6483
05:36:03,210 --> 05:36:03,990
Hey, portal.

6484
05:36:06,070 --> 05:36:06,850
That's fine.

6485
05:36:07,590 --> 05:36:08,610
Oh, we're stuck here?

6486
05:36:08,690 --> 05:36:09,010
What the fuck?

6487
05:36:10,170 --> 05:36:10,890
Sounds fine.

6488
05:36:10,970 --> 05:36:11,850
Of course you're stuck.

6489
05:36:14,070 --> 05:36:14,410
Hello.

6490
05:36:15,290 --> 05:36:16,010
Hello.

6491
05:36:16,790 --> 05:36:17,230
Hahaha.

6492
05:36:18,710 --> 05:36:21,490
I hope you're feeling inspired.

6493
05:36:28,770 --> 05:36:29,490
Oh.

6494
05:36:31,470 --> 05:36:32,130
That's fine.

6495
05:36:35,810 --> 05:36:36,610
That's not fine.

6496
05:36:37,890 --> 05:36:42,110
Is the what?

6497
05:36:45,550 --> 05:36:46,370
Magnus won.

6498
05:36:50,570 --> 05:36:51,950
Strange is asleep.

6499
05:36:54,550 --> 05:36:55,030
Oh no.

6500
05:36:56,070 --> 05:36:56,950
Oh no!

6501
05:37:00,550 --> 05:37:03,590
Yeah, I'm down.

6502
05:37:06,130 --> 05:37:06,610
Oh.

6503
05:37:08,710 --> 05:37:09,670
He said...

6504
05:37:09,670 --> 05:37:10,290
He...

6505
05:37:11,130 --> 05:37:12,950
Basically he was shit-talking our...

6506
05:37:12,950 --> 05:37:14,990
He was shit-talking our Starlord.

6507
05:37:15,730 --> 05:37:17,310
He was saying he's not real.

6508
05:37:19,470 --> 05:37:21,230
I got it, but Starlord's gonna ult after this.

6509
05:37:24,350 --> 05:37:24,830
Starlord...

6510
05:37:25,430 --> 05:37:25,910
Yeah.

6511
05:37:28,050 --> 05:37:29,410
We're gonna have Starlord ult.

6512
05:37:29,630 --> 05:37:30,910
We don't have support ults for it.

6513
05:37:37,250 --> 05:37:37,930
Alright.

6514
05:37:38,390 --> 05:37:39,450
You go Luna.

6515
05:37:39,750 --> 05:37:41,510
Farm that support ult.

6516
05:37:41,850 --> 05:37:43,610
I will let you farm it.

6517
05:37:44,750 --> 05:37:46,970
I believe in the dream.

6518
05:37:50,850 --> 05:37:52,490
You think she's gonna be able to do it?

6519
05:37:52,970 --> 05:37:54,050
She's getting there.

6520
05:37:54,710 --> 05:37:56,470
She's getting there.

6521
05:37:57,430 --> 05:37:59,530
I'm letting her farm it.

6522
05:38:00,910 --> 05:38:01,830
She didn't get it.

6523
05:38:02,090 --> 05:38:03,550
She didn't get it.

6524
05:38:04,190 --> 05:38:05,670
She didn't get it, guys.

6525
05:38:06,150 --> 05:38:07,530
She didn't...

6526
05:38:10,870 --> 05:38:12,550
Guys, she didn't get it.

6527
05:38:12,610 --> 05:38:13,330
I believed.

6528
05:38:14,050 --> 05:38:17,070
Believing is always not the answer, guys.

6529
05:38:18,130 --> 05:38:19,710
Never believe again.

6530
05:38:20,310 --> 05:38:22,910
I literally didn't heal because I believed.

6531
05:38:28,140 --> 05:38:29,280
Oh no.

6532
05:38:32,280 --> 05:38:33,660
Oh my god.

6533
05:38:33,740 --> 05:38:34,780
I died.

6534
05:38:36,260 --> 05:38:39,940
I didn't build ult because I believed.

6535
05:38:42,080 --> 05:38:43,340
I actually...

6536
05:38:43,340 --> 05:38:45,100
I'm 10% off if you guys can live.

6537
05:38:47,940 --> 05:38:48,740
Oh, Magneto.

6538
05:38:51,140 --> 05:38:51,980
Where?

6539
05:38:51,980 --> 05:38:52,140
You know what?

6540
05:38:54,760 --> 05:38:55,520
Where?

6541
05:38:58,420 --> 05:39:00,460
Let me ult first, by the way.

6542
05:39:05,800 --> 05:39:06,560
Anytime.

6543
05:39:14,200 --> 05:39:17,320
I was waiting for the ult.

6544
05:39:17,320 --> 05:39:19,040
We are undefeatable!

6545
05:39:22,400 --> 05:39:23,040
I believe.

6546
05:39:25,480 --> 05:39:26,760
I believe.

6547
05:39:27,560 --> 05:39:28,180
Oh, that's ours.

6548
05:39:28,320 --> 05:39:29,920
I always get confused which is ours.

6549
05:39:32,660 --> 05:39:33,780
Oh my god.

6550
05:39:37,710 --> 05:39:38,670
That's fine.

6551
05:39:41,110 --> 05:39:43,090
Oh my god, I...

6552
05:39:43,090 --> 05:39:44,870
I'm scared.

6553
05:39:47,930 --> 05:39:51,350
I'm trying not to peek too much.

6554
05:39:55,910 --> 05:39:58,230
Please, farm that support.

6555
05:39:59,550 --> 05:40:00,630
Oh, we should be fine.

6556
05:40:03,750 --> 05:40:05,750
I slept the Magneto.

6557
05:40:06,870 --> 05:40:07,770
Magneto's low.

6558
05:40:10,490 --> 05:40:11,430
Strange one!

6559
05:40:15,870 --> 05:40:16,650
Damage!

6560
05:40:23,340 --> 05:40:24,720
Oh my god!

6561
05:40:25,080 --> 05:40:27,800
This is the last fight.

6562
05:40:32,580 --> 05:40:40,780
Oh my god!

6563
05:40:41,420 --> 05:40:42,800
That's right!

6564
05:40:44,660 --> 05:40:46,220
Poor Mutant God.

6565
05:40:49,960 --> 05:40:52,270
I still hate Mutant God.

6566
05:40:58,140 --> 05:40:59,620
I'm joking.

6567
05:41:01,580 --> 05:41:02,320
Doki.

6568
05:41:02,460 --> 05:41:10,420
Do you know what I'm about to do, Doki?

6569
05:41:10,820 --> 05:41:13,380
You want to jump, don't you?

6570
05:41:13,380 --> 05:41:14,180
Yeah!

6571
05:41:15,960 --> 05:41:18,220
Then I'm going to go kidnap somebody.

6572
05:41:18,360 --> 05:41:21,480
I'm going to double jump into our spawn.

6573
05:41:22,700 --> 05:41:23,980
Oh my god.

6574
05:41:25,560 --> 05:41:28,500
Alright, no hands.

6575
05:41:29,240 --> 05:41:32,480
Why is my Magneto at the skybox with Wolverine?

6576
05:41:33,300 --> 05:41:35,540
No hands, let's go!

6577
05:41:36,440 --> 05:41:37,680
No hands mode!

6578
05:41:38,260 --> 05:41:41,300
No hands!

6579
05:41:44,620 --> 05:41:45,460
Okay, everybody.

6580
05:41:45,580 --> 05:41:46,400
Here's what's going to happen.

6581
05:41:46,500 --> 05:41:47,640
I'm going to go behind them.

6582
05:41:48,460 --> 05:41:51,000
I'm going to go kidnap somebody.

6583
05:41:51,240 --> 05:41:52,620
Double jump to the skybox.

6584
05:41:52,820 --> 05:41:54,920
And take them all the way to our spawn.

6585
05:41:55,080 --> 05:41:56,700
Get ready to kill him when I do.

6586
05:41:58,180 --> 05:42:01,980
It would be so funny if they're watching the stream right now.

6587
05:42:07,300 --> 05:42:09,780
There would just be like five people just waiting.

6588
05:42:10,400 --> 05:42:11,960
It would be so funny.

6589
05:42:19,260 --> 05:42:20,360
Where's the kidnap?

6590
05:42:21,060 --> 05:42:21,800
Where is it?

6591
05:42:22,580 --> 05:42:23,740
Where's the kidnap?

6592
05:42:24,760 --> 05:42:25,700
Where is it?

6593
05:42:26,700 --> 05:42:27,540
No hands!

6594
05:42:27,620 --> 05:42:28,680
Look at this, no hands!

6595
05:42:29,180 --> 05:42:30,680
Wow, no hands!

6596
05:42:31,100 --> 05:42:32,020
I got the Luna!

6597
05:42:32,100 --> 05:42:32,500
I got the Luna!

6598
05:42:32,620 --> 05:42:32,920
I'm flying!

6599
05:42:33,060 --> 05:42:33,340
I'm flying!

6600
05:42:33,460 --> 05:42:33,700
Kill her!

6601
05:42:35,220 --> 05:42:35,700
Welcome.

6602
05:42:37,380 --> 05:42:38,060
You're welcome.

6603
05:42:39,340 --> 05:42:39,820
Hahaha.

6604
05:42:39,820 --> 05:42:40,100
Hahaha.

6605
05:42:41,680 --> 05:42:42,940
No hands!

6606
05:42:43,080 --> 05:42:43,940
Oh my god.

6607
05:42:45,060 --> 05:42:45,520
Watch this.

6608
05:42:47,940 --> 05:42:49,340
Penny's so low.

6609
05:42:50,860 --> 05:42:51,280
Where?

6610
05:42:53,760 --> 05:42:55,300
I'm literally just...

6611
05:42:55,680 --> 05:42:57,000
I'm just right clicking.

6612
05:42:57,480 --> 05:42:59,720
I should like... get rid of my respawn.

6613
05:42:59,920 --> 05:43:01,300
Like, there's no reason to.

6614
05:43:01,660 --> 05:43:02,320
They tped?

6615
05:43:03,760 --> 05:43:05,020
Alright, ulting.

6616
05:43:17,850 --> 05:43:22,970
Oh shit, there's... oh, sorry buddy.

6617
05:43:29,030 --> 05:43:34,070
No, no, we're committing at this point.

6618
05:43:34,790 --> 05:43:36,530
Okay, well give me your rocket back then.

6619
05:43:37,410 --> 05:43:40,010
30 seconds, 30 seconds, our Luna died early.

6620
05:43:41,830 --> 05:43:43,630
To be fair, it was my fault, I didn't heal her.

6621
05:43:52,030 --> 05:43:53,590
Oh shit, double support ult!

6622
05:44:01,250 --> 05:44:06,450
Guys, are you so excited watching Rocket gameplay?

6623
05:44:07,010 --> 05:44:09,470
Oh my, so engaging.

6624
05:44:10,310 --> 05:44:16,410
Actually, it's so... I'm throwing armor.

6625
05:44:18,450 --> 05:44:22,010
Oh my god, so fucking engaging.

6626
05:44:23,270 --> 05:44:24,670
Oh my god.

6627
05:44:26,630 --> 05:44:29,130
Okay, I'm gonna ult and then swap off here.

6628
05:44:29,570 --> 05:44:30,490
I'm 20%.

6629
05:44:31,110 --> 05:44:32,930
He's looking for a strange ult.

6630
05:44:35,030 --> 05:44:35,550
That is strange.

6631
05:44:37,350 --> 05:44:38,010
Okay, I got...

6632
05:44:42,010 --> 05:44:43,750
Oh my god!

6633
05:44:43,950 --> 05:44:46,250
Okay, poor Beautycon, let's go!

6634
05:44:48,390 --> 05:44:50,650
Alright, let's go.

6635
05:44:53,590 --> 05:44:56,530
Oh my god, this gameplay!

6636
05:44:58,610 --> 05:45:01,590
Oh my god, I'm still... I'm right clicking.

6637
05:45:02,650 --> 05:45:04,070
I'm right clicking.

6638
05:45:05,590 --> 05:45:08,490
I'm trying so hard to keep you off.

6639
05:45:10,290 --> 05:45:11,610
Oh my god.

6640
05:45:14,770 --> 05:45:18,030
Jesus, Chris, how are we all still alive?

6641
05:45:18,030 --> 05:45:18,290
Oh my god.

6642
05:45:19,850 --> 05:45:21,250
Can we help Maze?

6643
05:45:21,310 --> 05:45:21,690
Help Maze.

6644
05:45:22,630 --> 05:45:23,890
We're up one, we're up one.

6645
05:45:26,910 --> 05:45:27,710
Strange is half.

6646
05:45:27,870 --> 05:45:29,050
Strange one, strange one, strange one!

6647
05:45:32,710 --> 05:45:35,110
Alright guys, I'm gonna go back and swap.

6648
05:45:37,810 --> 05:45:39,850
Alright, it's time.

6649
05:45:39,990 --> 05:45:41,310
I'm done playing Rocket.

6650
05:45:44,870 --> 05:45:45,350
Alright.

6651
05:45:48,030 --> 05:45:49,910
Alright, I'm gonna stop throwing now.

6652
05:45:52,470 --> 05:45:54,950
There's a Starlord behind us, up top, high ground.

6653
05:46:06,260 --> 05:46:07,700
Behind us, behind us!

6654
05:46:13,120 --> 05:46:14,260
Penny is like half.

6655
05:46:15,320 --> 05:46:16,420
Penny one, Penny one, Penny one!

6656
05:46:21,430 --> 05:46:22,610
Starlord, Starlord one!

6657
05:46:27,650 --> 05:46:28,710
There's a Starlord to our left.

6658
05:46:33,610 --> 05:46:34,510
Starlord's still low.

6659
05:46:34,870 --> 05:46:35,470
Everybody's still low.

6660
05:46:37,790 --> 05:46:38,910
Oh, strange one, strange one!

6661
05:46:42,950 --> 05:46:44,070
He was one.

6662
05:46:44,190 --> 05:46:46,490
I swear to god, I saw it with my own eyes.

6663
05:46:49,710 --> 05:46:50,890
I'm gonna ult this, I'm gonna ult this.

6664
05:46:51,410 --> 05:46:52,270
We can win this fight.

6665
05:46:52,270 --> 05:46:54,330
Penny one, Penny one, Penny one!

6666
05:46:57,670 --> 05:47:00,250
He keeps getting healed, what can I say?

6667
05:47:10,710 --> 05:47:17,850
I have my ult too, bro.

6668
05:47:17,890 --> 05:47:18,510
Do you want to shield that?

6669
05:47:20,350 --> 05:47:21,270
Oh my god.

6670
05:47:29,660 --> 05:47:31,860
TP time, TP time!

6671
05:47:33,240 --> 05:47:37,380
Guys, if you say people are one, they'll all aim at him and then he'll eventually be one.

6672
05:47:37,640 --> 05:47:39,120
That's the strat, that's the thing.

6673
05:47:39,620 --> 05:47:41,320
It's not my fault if they didn't shoot him.

6674
05:47:42,460 --> 05:47:44,740
If you shoot him, they're eventually one.

6675
05:47:46,720 --> 05:47:48,620
Oh my god, this server is lagging.

6676
05:47:52,220 --> 05:47:54,660
What the fuck is wrong with this server?

6677
05:48:00,400 --> 05:48:01,600
Behind us!

6678
05:48:06,860 --> 05:48:11,520
I don't think I'm getting ult here.

6679
05:48:11,640 --> 05:48:13,120
Last fight, oh man.

6680
05:48:13,860 --> 05:48:17,640
I don't have Lee's here for heals.

6681
05:48:22,300 --> 05:48:27,500
I slept him, I slept him!

6682
05:48:28,120 --> 05:48:32,720
Can I get that?

6683
05:48:32,820 --> 05:48:34,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6684
05:48:34,280 --> 05:48:35,060
Help our tanks, help our tanks!

6685
05:48:38,780 --> 05:48:39,500
Oh no.

6686
05:48:41,680 --> 05:48:42,600
D.Va is boosting you.

6687
05:48:43,620 --> 05:48:43,980
Starlord.

6688
05:48:47,960 --> 05:48:49,140
We got to stay on point, stay on point.

6689
05:48:50,400 --> 05:48:52,660
Starlord, Starlord, Starlord!

6690
05:48:57,260 --> 05:48:58,660
No!

6691
05:48:59,880 --> 05:49:02,220
We actually lost that?

6692
05:49:07,180 --> 05:49:10,400
We actually lost that!

6693
05:49:13,320 --> 05:49:15,580
I can't believe... I blame Rocket.

6694
05:49:16,820 --> 05:49:17,260
I...

6695
05:49:17,260 --> 05:49:19,360
I blame...

6696
05:49:22,660 --> 05:49:24,000
I blame Rocket.

6697
05:49:24,300 --> 05:49:26,960
I told you, Rocket's a curse.

6698
05:49:30,480 --> 05:49:30,920
Rocket!

6699
05:49:31,500 --> 05:49:32,140
No!

6700
05:49:33,500 --> 05:49:36,520
I even swapped off Rocket!

6701
05:49:38,380 --> 05:49:40,980
It's cause you quit Rocket.

6702
05:49:41,780 --> 05:49:43,900
Too little, no Rocket was...

6703
05:49:44,640 --> 05:49:47,500
Just swapped off Rocket after first fight.

6704
05:49:48,040 --> 05:49:49,160
It's a curse though.

6705
05:49:49,620 --> 05:49:50,660
Oh my god.

6706
05:49:56,720 --> 05:49:57,480
I...

6707
05:49:57,480 --> 05:49:59,180
It was all Rocket's fault.

6708
05:49:59,300 --> 05:49:59,800
I blame...

6709
05:49:59,800 --> 05:50:02,840
I blame Rocket.

6710
05:50:09,480 --> 05:50:11,040
Oh my god.

6711
05:50:12,340 --> 05:50:14,280
No, but we needed Manta's ult.

6712
05:50:14,680 --> 05:50:15,540
That's the thing.

6713
05:50:16,520 --> 05:50:17,440
We needed...

6714
05:50:17,440 --> 05:50:19,420
We needed the Manta's ult there.

6715
05:50:21,660 --> 05:50:23,040
Yeah, Mace is crashing.

6716
05:50:23,200 --> 05:50:23,820
What do you say?

6717
05:50:26,580 --> 05:50:30,200
He just says, hopefully you can go and lay in bed with your loving wife.

6718
05:50:31,100 --> 05:50:33,040
I'll still be here queuing like a loser.

6719
05:50:33,100 --> 05:50:33,960
Oh my god.

6720
05:50:34,620 --> 05:50:35,920
I don't think he's okay.

6721
05:50:37,540 --> 05:50:38,360
Yeah, I'm queuing.

6722
05:50:40,680 --> 05:50:41,560
I'm not...

6723
05:50:41,560 --> 05:50:42,500
I'm not a loser.

6724
05:50:43,480 --> 05:50:44,860
I have you guys here.

6725
05:50:45,940 --> 05:50:46,380
I...

6726
05:50:50,260 --> 05:50:52,000
Guys, I'm not a loser, right?

6727
05:50:53,400 --> 05:50:54,520
I'm still...

6728
05:50:54,520 --> 05:50:57,540
What does that say about you guys watching me queue, huh?

6729
05:51:00,960 --> 05:51:01,520
Guys...

6730
05:51:01,520 --> 05:51:05,700
Guys, if I'm a loser for queuing Marvel Rivals right now...

6731
05:51:06,060 --> 05:51:08,300
At 4.30 in the morning...

6732
05:51:08,300 --> 05:51:13,260
What does that say about you guys watching me queue at 4.30 in the morning?

6733
05:51:19,720 --> 05:51:21,400
That's right, we're in it together.

6734
05:51:21,800 --> 05:51:24,000
We're fucking in it together, chat.

6735
05:51:26,900 --> 05:51:28,740
We're from EU.

6736
05:51:29,440 --> 05:51:31,640
Also, Muta, thank you for the raid.

6737
05:51:31,880 --> 05:51:32,640
Thank you, thank you.

6738
05:51:32,660 --> 05:51:33,660
I really appreciate it.

6739
05:51:33,840 --> 05:51:36,440
For those who don't know, my name is Doki Bird.

6740
05:51:36,640 --> 05:51:41,620
I usually stream on YouTube, but I have a crippling addiction to Marvel Rivals right now.

6741
05:51:41,700 --> 05:51:46,720
So now I'm here on Twitch because I don't know how long it'll be until I can be okay.

6742
05:51:47,260 --> 05:51:47,960
Oh no, I know.

6743
05:51:48,060 --> 05:51:48,500
Six days.

6744
05:51:48,500 --> 05:51:50,240
In six days, I'll be fine.

6745
05:51:50,740 --> 05:51:52,080
In six days.

6746
05:51:57,520 --> 05:51:58,500
Yes, Wii.

6747
05:51:58,680 --> 05:52:00,760
You're here watching this crippling addiction.

6748
05:52:02,920 --> 05:52:03,780
It's like...

6749
05:52:03,780 --> 05:52:06,180
It's like the opposite of alcoholic anonymous.

6750
05:52:12,000 --> 05:52:13,220
Don't say that!

6751
05:52:13,400 --> 05:52:14,240
Don't say that.

6752
05:52:14,320 --> 05:52:15,800
I've invested too much time already.

6753
05:52:16,820 --> 05:52:19,020
Don't say that, chat.

6754
05:52:20,060 --> 05:52:22,880
I've invested way too much time on this already.

6755
05:52:23,840 --> 05:52:25,200
What did I hit proficiency on?

6756
05:52:25,380 --> 05:52:25,900
I upgraded.

6757
05:52:26,040 --> 05:52:26,560
Is it lowkey?

6758
05:52:27,080 --> 05:52:28,700
Oh my god, guys, I did it.

6759
05:52:28,980 --> 05:52:29,940
I got my icon.

6760
05:52:31,040 --> 05:52:31,540
Nice.

6761
05:52:33,420 --> 05:52:34,940
I got my one icon.

6762
05:52:35,300 --> 05:52:36,100
When do I hit lord?

6763
05:52:37,160 --> 05:52:37,980
I need...

6764
05:52:37,980 --> 05:52:39,580
Hero usage reaches 60 minutes.

6765
05:52:39,760 --> 05:52:41,360
Have I not played Mantis?

6766
05:52:41,500 --> 05:52:44,300
I still haven't played Mantis for 60 minutes yet?

6767
05:52:44,480 --> 05:52:44,840
That's crazy.

6768
05:52:44,980 --> 05:52:45,700
I thought I did.

6769
05:52:51,060 --> 05:52:52,540
No, he won the audition.

6770
05:52:53,000 --> 05:52:54,680
But queue times took 10 plus minutes.

6771
05:52:55,260 --> 05:52:56,280
So like...

6772
05:52:56,280 --> 05:52:58,140
We'll queue it out another time.

6773
05:53:00,400 --> 05:53:03,560
Oh, it gives points every 60 minutes.

6774
05:53:05,260 --> 05:53:07,100
Also, Cosmic, thank you for the 100 bitties.

6775
05:53:07,180 --> 05:53:08,080
Thank you, thank you.

6776
05:53:08,520 --> 05:53:09,160
Oh, is it Ted?

6777
05:53:09,540 --> 05:53:10,680
Oh god, thank god, Ted.

6778
05:53:10,760 --> 05:53:12,000
Oh my god, he's still down there.

6779
05:53:12,100 --> 05:53:12,620
But it's okay.

6780
05:53:12,680 --> 05:53:13,580
I'm down here too.

6781
05:53:14,300 --> 05:53:14,740
He's...

6782
05:53:16,180 --> 05:53:16,940
It's okay.

6783
05:53:17,380 --> 05:53:17,820
We're...

6784
05:53:17,820 --> 05:53:18,620
I'm just...

6785
05:53:18,620 --> 05:53:20,480
I'm at the same level as Ted.

6786
05:53:21,380 --> 05:53:24,020
Which makes me feel so good about myself.

6787
05:53:28,940 --> 05:53:29,580
I...

6788
05:53:29,580 --> 05:53:33,200
I'm so happy that I'm at the same level as Ted.

6789
05:53:34,660 --> 05:53:36,920
Here, thank you for the 5 gifted subs.

6790
05:53:37,040 --> 05:53:38,040
Thank you, thank you.

6791
05:53:40,780 --> 05:53:42,060
Who's Remedy again?

6792
05:53:42,600 --> 05:53:45,080
Oh, that's the...

6793
05:53:45,620 --> 05:53:46,660
Scarlet Witch.

6794
05:53:47,660 --> 05:53:48,300
Player.

6795
05:53:48,620 --> 05:53:49,380
I remember her.

6796
05:53:56,440 --> 05:53:59,720
What if I just banrock it right now?

6797
05:54:06,370 --> 05:54:07,650
Oh shit, sorry.

6798
05:54:08,490 --> 05:54:09,390
Sorry.

6799
05:54:11,310 --> 05:54:12,290
The lord!

6800
05:54:12,950 --> 05:54:14,090
I see the...

6801
05:54:14,090 --> 05:54:15,190
The lord!

6802
05:54:16,750 --> 05:54:17,670
Sorry.

6803
05:54:17,970 --> 05:54:20,130
I'm not even gonna apologize.

6804
05:54:20,630 --> 05:54:21,430
I like...

6805
05:54:27,170 --> 05:54:28,310
Oh, it's fine.

6806
05:54:28,490 --> 05:54:28,750
They're cute.

6807
05:54:28,930 --> 05:54:29,350
They're cute.

6808
05:54:29,690 --> 05:54:30,070
They...

6809
05:54:30,070 --> 05:54:31,950
They ban Scarlet too.

6810
05:54:36,310 --> 05:54:36,870
What?

6811
05:54:38,310 --> 05:54:39,730
Cute in a 3 second...

6812
05:54:39,730 --> 05:54:41,810
But why are you still playing on alts?

6813
05:54:42,090 --> 05:54:43,310
Is this his only alt?

6814
05:54:48,930 --> 05:54:50,130
How do they know?

6815
05:54:50,330 --> 05:54:50,870
I don't know.

6816
05:54:50,970 --> 05:54:53,690
If we pull up Marvel Rivals website...

6817
05:54:53,690 --> 05:54:54,970
Category on Twitch.

6818
05:54:55,090 --> 05:54:56,010
How would they know?

6819
05:54:56,870 --> 05:54:57,430
How...

6820
05:54:58,110 --> 05:54:58,930
That's so...

6821
05:54:58,930 --> 05:54:59,410
I'm on Twitch.

6822
05:54:59,410 --> 05:55:00,210
That's a surprise.

6823
05:55:00,450 --> 05:55:02,850
So many of you guys are watching my downward spiral.

6824
05:55:03,670 --> 05:55:05,410
Like, I didn't realize...

6825
05:55:10,370 --> 05:55:12,410
Versus Overwatch now is...

6826
05:55:13,410 --> 05:55:13,850
Marvel...

6827
05:55:17,690 --> 05:55:18,130
Okay.

6828
05:55:23,670 --> 05:55:24,770
Wait, no, that's not...

6829
05:55:24,770 --> 05:55:25,270
I'm not...

6830
05:55:25,270 --> 05:55:26,470
Sorry, I reported the wrong person.

6831
05:55:26,550 --> 05:55:27,690
I almost reported though.

6832
05:55:29,410 --> 05:55:30,070
Jesus.

6833
05:55:33,950 --> 05:55:35,270
I can't...

6834
05:55:35,270 --> 05:55:36,590
I can't even report.

6835
05:55:37,330 --> 05:55:38,410
He won't let me.

6836
05:55:39,930 --> 05:55:42,110
He won't even let me.

6837
05:55:44,070 --> 05:55:47,030
He won't even let me fucking report him.

6838
05:55:48,730 --> 05:55:49,510
Alright, I'll do it later.

6839
05:55:51,130 --> 05:55:52,390
Bro, what the fuck?

6840
05:55:52,490 --> 05:55:53,410
I'm just...

6841
05:55:57,880 --> 05:56:01,040
It truly is Doomer hours right now.

6842
05:56:01,040 --> 05:56:02,420
It truly is.

6843
05:56:06,000 --> 05:56:09,180
Bro, why are people so mad?

6844
05:56:09,900 --> 05:56:12,020
It's like everybody's stacks too.

6845
05:56:14,780 --> 05:56:17,080
Why are people angry?

6846
05:56:19,040 --> 05:56:20,420
It's actually crazy.

6847
05:56:22,500 --> 05:56:24,400
Oh yeah, I was supposed to put this on him.

6848
05:56:27,320 --> 05:56:29,760
Why is everyone so mad?

6849
05:56:30,490 --> 05:56:31,780
Why is...

6850
05:56:31,780 --> 05:56:33,260
Why are people so mad?

6851
05:56:34,720 --> 05:56:38,560
I'm just trying to fucking play video games.

6852
05:56:41,610 --> 05:56:42,770
I'm just trying...

6853
05:56:43,680 --> 05:56:45,700
Trying to play video games.

6854
05:56:46,740 --> 05:56:49,620
Just trying to play video games.

6855
05:56:50,400 --> 05:56:56,280
Just trying to play video games and keep our players alive.

6856
05:57:00,560 --> 05:57:03,580
Just still trying to play video games.

6857
05:57:06,460 --> 05:57:07,760
Oh, people are...

6858
05:57:08,800 --> 05:57:10,220
I have magic on me?

6859
05:57:11,380 --> 05:57:12,960
Oh, please!

6860
05:57:15,220 --> 05:57:17,240
Where did her cloak go?

6861
05:57:17,300 --> 05:57:18,800
Why is she over there?

6862
05:57:20,220 --> 05:57:23,260
Why is her cloak over there?

6863
05:57:26,660 --> 05:57:27,980
She disappeared.

6864
05:57:32,380 --> 05:57:33,280
Strong person.

6865
05:57:33,600 --> 05:57:35,360
I don't want to use my clap yet though.

6866
05:57:36,980 --> 05:57:38,520
Our cloak can heal our Spider-Man, right?

6867
05:57:39,000 --> 05:57:39,260
Nope.

6868
05:57:40,200 --> 05:57:40,440
Alright.

6869
05:57:41,200 --> 05:57:42,120
Jesus Christ.

6870
05:57:42,540 --> 05:57:43,300
Jesus Christ.

6871
05:57:44,160 --> 05:57:46,080
Okay, our cloak can heal our Spider-Man, right?

6872
05:57:47,040 --> 05:57:47,720
That's fine.

6873
05:57:49,180 --> 05:57:50,220
Yeah, he totally can.

6874
05:57:52,020 --> 05:57:53,140
Oh my god.

6875
05:57:55,720 --> 05:57:57,500
You're so healthy right now.

6876
05:58:00,360 --> 05:58:02,800
Who is he trying to ult there?

6877
05:58:03,680 --> 05:58:04,420
I don't...

6878
05:58:04,420 --> 05:58:06,720
I don't even know.

6879
05:58:07,440 --> 05:58:08,220
Who was that?

6880
05:58:08,560 --> 05:58:09,420
Who was that?

6881
05:58:10,700 --> 05:58:13,620
Okay, I'm fucking backing out from that.

6882
05:58:13,900 --> 05:58:14,460
That's fine.

6883
05:58:15,640 --> 05:58:16,100
Again!

6884
05:58:18,100 --> 05:58:18,780
Again!

6885
05:58:21,880 --> 05:58:22,560
Again!

6886
05:58:22,560 --> 05:58:22,900
Again!

6887
05:58:27,240 --> 05:58:28,740
There we go.

6888
05:58:29,440 --> 05:58:30,300
Yeah, that was...

6889
05:58:30,300 --> 05:58:32,000
That was a freaky ult right there.

6890
05:58:36,500 --> 05:58:37,120
I...

6891
05:58:37,120 --> 05:58:39,020
I hope this spider stubs his toe.

6892
05:58:40,220 --> 05:58:40,860
Somebody...

6893
05:58:40,860 --> 05:58:42,900
Somebody break his kneecaps right now.

6894
05:58:43,440 --> 05:58:44,420
So I can heal them.

6895
05:58:45,300 --> 05:58:46,980
It's not skill dip.

6896
05:58:47,400 --> 05:58:48,480
That's a strange one.

6897
05:58:51,560 --> 05:58:52,880
He needs to...

6898
05:58:52,880 --> 05:58:54,040
He needs to stop.

6899
05:58:54,620 --> 05:58:55,600
I can't...

6900
05:58:55,600 --> 05:58:57,560
Jarvis, break his legs.

6901
05:58:59,100 --> 05:58:59,720
I guess...

6902
05:58:59,720 --> 05:59:01,600
I guess it's not a skill dip.

6903
05:59:01,680 --> 05:59:03,740
I'm just tired of him jumping around.

6904
05:59:10,980 --> 05:59:12,880
For some reason...

6905
05:59:12,880 --> 05:59:16,380
Oh, just watch this game and then you know what the reason is.

6906
05:59:17,440 --> 05:59:19,580
Watch all the Spider-Man plays.

6907
05:59:19,580 --> 05:59:22,580
And you'll figure out what the reasons are.

6908
05:59:31,440 --> 05:59:33,320
I'm just gonna be right here.

6909
05:59:34,320 --> 05:59:35,340
I feel alive.

6910
05:59:36,260 --> 05:59:37,520
I feel so alive.

6911
05:59:38,840 --> 05:59:39,860
Right now.

6912
05:59:40,680 --> 05:59:43,140
I feel so alive right now.

6913
05:59:45,460 --> 05:59:46,400
I'm healing.

6914
05:59:46,580 --> 05:59:47,020
I'm healing.

6915
05:59:47,340 --> 05:59:47,760
God.

6916
05:59:48,420 --> 05:59:48,940
Okay.

6917
05:59:51,480 --> 05:59:52,760
I'm not gonna look.

6918
05:59:57,060 --> 05:59:57,580
Fuck.

6919
05:59:58,640 --> 05:59:59,680
Jesus Christ.

6920
05:59:59,780 --> 06:00:00,500
There's nothing I can do.

6921
06:00:00,580 --> 06:00:01,900
I might as well just fucking die.

6922
06:00:02,600 --> 06:00:03,580
I just...

6923
06:00:05,080 --> 06:00:06,120
I like...

6924
06:00:06,120 --> 06:00:08,320
Literally just like waited there.

6925
06:00:08,440 --> 06:00:09,980
And then I was like, well fine.

6926
06:00:10,080 --> 06:00:10,580
That's cool.

6927
06:00:11,700 --> 06:00:12,860
I'm cool with that.

6928
06:00:16,460 --> 06:00:17,140
It's alright.

6929
06:00:17,140 --> 06:00:17,480
It's alright.

6930
06:00:18,920 --> 06:00:20,620
Goodbye, super fishy.

6931
06:00:22,160 --> 06:00:23,160
Where are you?

6932
06:00:23,500 --> 06:00:26,760
Oh my god.

6933
06:00:27,240 --> 06:00:28,600
Oh my god.

6934
06:00:29,160 --> 06:00:30,640
Oh my god.

6935
06:00:31,880 --> 06:00:32,280
Is he?

6936
06:00:33,900 --> 06:00:35,060
Alright, that's good.

6937
06:00:37,660 --> 06:00:40,700
I just saw him die like that.

6938
06:00:42,160 --> 06:00:43,840
Truly is crazy.

6939
06:00:44,920 --> 06:00:46,200
What a wild time.

6940
06:00:47,260 --> 06:00:48,100
Oh.

6941
06:00:49,300 --> 06:00:49,980
We cap it?

6942
06:00:50,160 --> 06:00:50,440
Nice.

6943
06:00:51,300 --> 06:00:51,800
That's right.

6944
06:00:51,920 --> 06:00:52,600
Your life...

6945
06:00:52,600 --> 06:00:53,780
What you did...

6946
06:00:53,780 --> 06:00:55,980
What your contribution here did not matter.

6947
06:00:56,660 --> 06:00:57,520
Remember that.

6948
06:00:58,560 --> 06:01:02,380
You basically wasted a Luna ult for no reason.

6949
06:01:04,840 --> 06:01:05,680
Remember that.

6950
06:01:06,680 --> 06:01:10,600
Remember that your contribution means nothing in this world!

6951
06:01:13,640 --> 06:01:14,880
You're fine.

6952
06:01:15,800 --> 06:01:17,220
You know, you're so fine.

6953
06:01:17,340 --> 06:01:19,040
I'm not even gonna move.

6954
06:01:20,200 --> 06:01:21,680
Oh my god.

6955
06:01:21,700 --> 06:01:23,120
Good job, Spider-Man.

6956
06:01:26,700 --> 06:01:27,780
I'm on point.

6957
06:01:28,900 --> 06:01:29,720
I'm staying.

6958
06:01:30,820 --> 06:01:31,680
I'm gonna stay.

6959
06:01:32,600 --> 06:01:33,480
Here I go.

6960
06:01:35,520 --> 06:01:36,780
Did he do it?

6961
06:01:38,420 --> 06:01:39,260
Did he do it?

6962
06:01:39,580 --> 06:01:40,820
They're still shooting out.

6963
06:01:44,880 --> 06:01:47,060
Guys, I don't think he did it.

6964
06:01:50,540 --> 06:01:52,220
Is that...

6965
06:01:52,220 --> 06:01:54,880
I believe for a second, but believing...

6966
06:01:55,920 --> 06:01:57,940
Believing only makes you...

6967
06:01:58,860 --> 06:02:00,640
Believing is a lie.

6968
06:02:01,620 --> 06:02:02,500
Oh shit!

6969
06:02:03,220 --> 06:02:03,740
Who's that?

6970
06:02:04,760 --> 06:02:05,340
Who's that?

6971
06:02:08,960 --> 06:02:10,220
Believing's a lie.

6972
06:02:14,880 --> 06:02:15,980
To switch things up.

6973
06:02:16,260 --> 06:02:18,200
Including which side you're on.

6974
06:02:19,720 --> 06:02:21,000
Pure chaos.

6975
06:02:21,280 --> 06:02:22,040
I'm Luna Snow.

6976
06:02:22,700 --> 06:02:24,320
Like the moon, I shine.

6977
06:02:24,320 --> 06:02:25,140
What's going on?

6978
06:02:25,400 --> 06:02:27,200
Where the fuck is going...

6979
06:02:27,640 --> 06:02:29,080
What is going on?!

6980
06:02:40,400 --> 06:02:41,680
I'm just...

6981
06:02:41,680 --> 06:02:43,940
Just trying to have a game.

6982
06:02:43,940 --> 06:02:45,100
What's going on?

6983
06:02:45,220 --> 06:02:46,120
I'm just...

6984
06:02:46,120 --> 06:02:46,940
I'm just...

6985
06:02:48,220 --> 06:02:49,060
I'm not even...

6986
06:02:49,060 --> 06:02:50,000
I'm not even...

6987
06:02:50,720 --> 06:02:52,080
Trying that hard.

6988
06:02:52,780 --> 06:02:54,240
Okay, I am to be fair.

6989
06:02:54,480 --> 06:02:56,160
I am, but I'm not even like...

6990
06:02:57,560 --> 06:02:58,520
Like a...

6991
06:02:58,520 --> 06:02:59,340
What is it called?

6992
06:02:59,480 --> 06:03:00,940
You know like when people are like super...

6993
06:03:03,700 --> 06:03:04,660
Super like...

6994
06:03:04,660 --> 06:03:05,500
Toxic.

6995
06:03:06,860 --> 06:03:07,340
And...

6996
06:03:07,340 --> 06:03:08,620
Well, I am toxic, but like...

6997
06:03:08,620 --> 06:03:09,140
You know like...

6998
06:03:09,140 --> 06:03:10,800
You know like gaming toxic?

6999
06:03:11,220 --> 06:03:13,300
Like I still laugh it off if we lose.

7000
06:03:13,300 --> 06:03:14,220
But like...

7001
06:03:14,220 --> 06:03:14,760
Yeah, I'm malding.

7002
06:03:14,840 --> 06:03:15,940
I'm not even malding.

7003
06:03:16,080 --> 06:03:18,000
I'm just trying to have a nice time.

7004
06:03:20,700 --> 06:03:21,700
I'm still...

7005
06:03:22,190 --> 06:03:23,180
I'm still sweaty.

7006
06:03:23,520 --> 06:03:24,300
I just...

7007
06:03:25,000 --> 06:03:26,460
I don't like...

7008
06:03:26,460 --> 06:03:29,720
I'm not like super sweaty where I mostly just focus on the game.

7009
06:03:30,140 --> 06:03:31,160
I'm just...

7010
06:03:31,160 --> 06:03:32,860
I'm just trying to have a nice time.

7011
06:03:35,440 --> 06:03:36,940
Yeah, my malding is content.

7012
06:03:40,680 --> 06:03:42,000
Why are people sad?

7013
06:03:43,950 --> 06:03:45,500
Why people freak out?

7014
06:03:47,880 --> 06:03:49,300
It's just video games.

7015
06:03:52,950 --> 06:03:55,140
I say it as I got the...

7016
06:03:55,140 --> 06:03:57,300
As I have this crippling addiction...

7017
06:03:58,020 --> 06:03:59,920
To fucking Marvel Rises.

7018
06:04:00,980 --> 06:04:03,560
It's video games, but...

7019
06:04:04,600 --> 06:04:05,380
Also...

7020
06:04:06,090 --> 06:04:08,300
Also, I would be very sad...

7021
06:04:08,820 --> 06:04:10,060
If lose video games.

7022
06:04:15,860 --> 06:04:17,000
Oh my god.

7023
06:04:17,460 --> 06:04:19,200
Oh my god.

7024
06:04:20,120 --> 06:04:23,660
I feel like I'm hearing two million sounds at the same time.

7025
06:04:24,320 --> 06:04:27,740
Oh my god, please.

7026
06:04:29,920 --> 06:04:31,780
My heals is on everybody.

7027
06:04:32,400 --> 06:04:33,840
Oh my god.

7028
06:04:34,520 --> 06:04:35,660
It's on everyone.

7029
06:04:39,180 --> 06:04:39,820
Please.

7030
06:04:41,380 --> 06:04:43,900
You have your ult as well, sir.

7031
06:04:45,860 --> 06:04:46,420
Oh.

7032
06:04:46,580 --> 06:04:47,880
We did it.

7033
06:04:49,700 --> 06:04:51,400
Go Spider-Man, go!

7034
06:04:51,620 --> 06:04:52,140
Kill!

7035
06:04:55,240 --> 06:04:55,800
Kill.

7036
06:04:58,940 --> 06:05:00,820
No, I can't stop at any time.

7037
06:05:01,020 --> 06:05:01,440
I can't.

7038
06:05:01,460 --> 06:05:02,220
I have a problem.

7039
06:05:03,420 --> 06:05:04,400
I have a problem.

7040
06:05:04,540 --> 06:05:07,100
I'm surprised I still have a career after what I'm doing.

7041
06:05:09,960 --> 06:05:11,080
After my...

7042
06:05:11,080 --> 06:05:13,900
My third Marvel Rivals stream on Twitch.

7043
06:05:13,900 --> 06:05:15,740
I'm surprised I still have a career.

7044
06:05:23,080 --> 06:05:24,720
After the mutant hate.

7045
06:05:30,460 --> 06:05:32,000
There's a magic behind us.

7046
06:05:38,480 --> 06:05:39,100
Oh.

7047
06:05:39,500 --> 06:05:40,880
I have to ult this.

7048
06:05:42,120 --> 06:05:43,200
Oh my god.

7049
06:05:43,460 --> 06:05:43,920
He...

7050
06:05:43,920 --> 06:05:45,000
He tried to...

7051
06:05:45,000 --> 06:05:47,240
He snabbed into me and I got scared.

7052
06:05:48,000 --> 06:05:49,020
I have strange ult.

7053
06:05:51,840 --> 06:05:53,260
Oh my god, they're coming over.

7054
06:05:53,500 --> 06:05:54,240
He's coming over.

7055
06:05:54,620 --> 06:05:55,640
He's coming over.

7056
06:05:55,940 --> 06:05:56,560
Magic's up.

7057
06:05:57,820 --> 06:05:58,760
Oh my god.

7058
06:05:59,740 --> 06:06:01,340
I'm so scared.

7059
06:06:06,260 --> 06:06:07,320
There we go.

7060
06:06:08,500 --> 06:06:10,420
We will follow you till the end.

7061
06:06:10,920 --> 06:06:12,900
Guys, it's just six more days, guys.

7062
06:06:13,540 --> 06:06:15,000
It's just six...

7063
06:06:15,000 --> 06:06:18,060
Stay strong for me for six more days.

7064
06:06:18,200 --> 06:06:21,820
And then we'll be back to our regular scheduled content.

7065
06:06:22,260 --> 06:06:24,460
I swear to god.

7066
06:06:25,340 --> 06:06:27,480
Six more days of this.

7067
06:06:28,620 --> 06:06:32,740
But it could end faster if we get the secure top 500.

7068
06:06:33,280 --> 06:06:34,540
That's all I'm saying.

7069
06:06:34,940 --> 06:06:37,940
All I'm saying is like, you guys stop cursing me.

7070
06:06:38,220 --> 06:06:40,660
We'll get our content back faster.

7071
06:06:40,660 --> 06:06:41,060
I'm so scared.

7072
06:06:44,300 --> 06:06:46,140
There's a magic behind me.

7073
06:06:47,300 --> 06:06:48,040
Please.

7074
06:06:48,200 --> 06:06:48,920
Please.

7075
06:06:49,100 --> 06:06:49,360
No.

7076
06:06:54,140 --> 06:06:54,620
Geez.

7077
06:06:59,440 --> 06:07:00,180
Wee.

7078
06:07:01,620 --> 06:07:02,980
We are on season...

7079
06:07:02,980 --> 06:07:04,960
I just won't be as obsessive.

7080
06:07:05,420 --> 06:07:06,360
For season...

7081
06:07:06,360 --> 06:07:07,480
It's actually season one.

7082
06:07:07,660 --> 06:07:08,820
Apparently this is season zero.

7083
06:07:08,820 --> 06:07:10,800
And next season is season one.

7084
06:07:12,660 --> 06:07:13,620
Apparently.

7085
06:07:17,680 --> 06:07:18,280
Alright.

7086
06:07:19,580 --> 06:07:20,360
That's five.

7087
06:07:23,820 --> 06:07:24,320
Wee.

7088
06:07:25,580 --> 06:07:26,640
Thanks.

7089
06:07:26,800 --> 06:07:27,120
Goodbye.

7090
06:07:27,880 --> 06:07:29,380
Never even like...

7091
06:07:30,140 --> 06:07:31,380
I just realized...

7092
06:07:32,360 --> 06:07:33,560
She's frozen.

7093
06:07:39,980 --> 06:07:42,090
She'll be so safe.

7094
06:07:42,890 --> 06:07:43,650
You know what?

7095
06:07:43,710 --> 06:07:44,270
I believe.

7096
06:07:44,730 --> 06:07:46,610
I'm not even gonna use my ult.

7097
06:07:46,770 --> 06:07:49,290
That's how much I believe.

7098
06:07:50,670 --> 06:07:52,030
Season zero?

7099
06:07:52,310 --> 06:07:55,210
Season zero is like the most important season.

7100
06:07:55,350 --> 06:07:56,230
What do you mean?

7101
06:07:58,470 --> 06:08:01,970
We never hit top 500 in the real season.

7102
06:08:02,410 --> 06:08:04,410
Just that two hard one tricks.

7103
06:08:04,850 --> 06:08:05,290
Wee.

7104
06:08:05,290 --> 06:08:06,610
Ten didn't play rocket.

7105
06:08:07,310 --> 06:08:08,510
I just realized.

7106
06:08:09,690 --> 06:08:10,170
Guys.

7107
06:08:11,250 --> 06:08:13,510
I just realized ten didn't play rocket.

7108
06:08:13,790 --> 06:08:14,790
Holy shit.

7109
06:08:19,350 --> 06:08:20,230
That's crazy.

7110
06:08:21,730 --> 06:08:23,910
When I found you, but weren't for your...

7111
06:08:23,910 --> 06:08:25,730
Obsessed, so I'm fine watching you play.

7112
06:08:26,510 --> 06:08:26,990
Guys.

7113
06:08:27,510 --> 06:08:28,810
Guys, you still want...

7114
06:08:28,810 --> 06:08:30,190
For those who found me in VMR.

7115
06:08:30,290 --> 06:08:32,410
You guys will watch me when I do other stuff, right?

7116
06:08:33,590 --> 06:08:34,550
Guys, like...

7117
06:08:34,550 --> 06:08:36,450
Guys, I'm not just my bowl, right?

7118
06:08:36,730 --> 06:08:38,230
Guys, I swear.

7119
06:08:38,230 --> 06:08:38,790
I swear.

7120
06:08:40,210 --> 06:08:42,510
I swear, guys.

7121
06:08:42,630 --> 06:08:43,770
I am funny.

7122
06:08:44,030 --> 06:08:44,610
I swear.

7123
06:08:47,770 --> 06:08:50,770
Not just marble rivals.

7124
06:08:51,410 --> 06:08:52,970
I swear I'm funny.

7125
06:08:57,050 --> 06:09:03,000
I swear I'm funny and I can do variety.

7126
06:09:04,300 --> 06:09:05,120
Let's party.

7127
06:09:10,060 --> 06:09:11,140
Streaming.

7128
06:09:12,420 --> 06:09:14,940
I just wanna vibe.

7129
06:09:20,500 --> 06:09:21,580
Bro.

7130
06:09:30,410 --> 06:09:31,490
Bro.

7131
06:09:38,080 --> 06:09:38,660
What?

7132
06:09:39,420 --> 06:09:40,180
Bro.

7133
06:09:41,000 --> 06:09:43,540
Remedy, we were on the same team together.

7134
06:09:43,780 --> 06:09:44,060
Remedy.

7135
06:09:44,060 --> 06:09:44,400
Remedy.

7136
06:09:44,400 --> 06:09:45,940
We were fucking...

7137
06:09:50,570 --> 06:09:54,250
You were so cool when I had you on my team.

7138
06:09:54,430 --> 06:09:54,990
Remedy.

7139
06:10:01,440 --> 06:10:02,890
I don't use the bathroom.

7140
06:10:03,370 --> 06:10:04,550
They can fight all they want.

7141
06:10:04,610 --> 06:10:05,950
I'm just gonna fucking pee.

7142
06:11:01,170 --> 06:11:01,960
Still fighting?

7143
06:11:03,170 --> 06:11:03,900
Oh, they're not.

7144
06:11:04,100 --> 06:11:04,400
Okay.

7145
06:11:04,400 --> 06:11:04,620
Okay.

7146
06:11:07,020 --> 06:11:07,920
Bro.

7147
06:11:10,200 --> 06:11:12,340
That's actually crazy.

7148
06:11:14,340 --> 06:11:16,280
Bro, what the fuck?

7149
06:11:16,960 --> 06:11:20,300
What the fuck is going on?

7150
06:11:24,620 --> 06:11:25,700
He's on...

7151
06:11:25,700 --> 06:11:26,280
He's there.

7152
06:11:26,840 --> 06:11:27,540
Alright, guys.

7153
06:11:27,980 --> 06:11:28,620
Round two.

7154
06:11:30,950 --> 06:11:31,760
Round two.

7155
06:11:36,060 --> 06:11:40,360
Bro, Remedy was so cool when I solo queued into him.

7156
06:11:41,500 --> 06:11:42,260
What happened?

7157
06:11:43,380 --> 06:11:44,000
What happened?

7158
06:11:44,240 --> 06:11:46,340
It was only...

7159
06:11:46,340 --> 06:11:48,020
48 hours.

7160
06:11:48,420 --> 06:11:50,500
What happened in 48 hours?

7161
06:11:52,860 --> 06:11:53,980
What happened?

7162
06:11:54,880 --> 06:11:57,480
Literally, what happened in 48 hours?

7163
06:12:02,210 --> 06:12:05,390
He had to play marble rivals.

7164
06:12:09,710 --> 06:12:10,710
That's true.

7165
06:12:16,080 --> 06:12:19,560
In 48 hours, Ted became...

7166
06:12:19,560 --> 06:12:20,360
Ted...

7167
06:12:20,360 --> 06:12:24,240
No, in 24 hours, Ted became a not...

7168
06:12:24,240 --> 06:12:27,520
He actually reformed and is not a Rocky Raccoon 1 trick anymore.

7169
06:12:27,880 --> 06:12:29,140
And then like...

7170
06:12:30,580 --> 06:12:31,940
Wait, bad magic?

7171
06:12:32,400 --> 06:12:33,220
What do we ban?

7172
06:12:33,340 --> 06:12:33,760
Hawkeye?

7173
06:12:34,400 --> 06:12:35,140
I don't know.

7174
06:12:36,040 --> 06:12:36,500
What do we ban?

7175
06:12:36,540 --> 06:12:36,940
Hawkeye?

7176
06:12:37,020 --> 06:12:37,220
Okay.

7177
06:12:37,740 --> 06:12:41,260
And then like, in 48 hours, Remedy...

7178
06:12:41,260 --> 06:12:42,800
Remedy changed.

7179
06:12:43,260 --> 06:12:45,100
He was so cool on my team.

7180
06:12:45,800 --> 06:12:47,080
Like, we won with Remedy.

7181
06:12:47,240 --> 06:12:48,160
We won with Scarlet Witch.

7182
06:12:48,180 --> 06:12:50,700
We won like 2 or 3 games with Scarlet Witch.

7183
06:12:51,560 --> 06:12:52,300
On my team.

7184
06:12:53,220 --> 06:12:54,380
And then he just...

7185
06:12:54,380 --> 06:12:55,840
Something happened.

7186
06:12:59,380 --> 06:13:01,640
He absorbed Ted's team.

7187
06:13:02,420 --> 06:13:04,580
Bro, I even won with the Scarlet Witch.

7188
06:13:07,220 --> 06:13:09,020
Someone edit the squad tag.

7189
06:13:12,860 --> 06:13:14,720
Yeah, it actually changed.

7190
06:13:16,260 --> 06:13:18,300
War changes people.

7191
06:13:23,610 --> 06:13:25,210
Something snapped, yeah.

7192
06:13:26,130 --> 06:13:29,710
Something happened in between those 48 hours.

7193
06:13:32,630 --> 06:13:34,510
I'm just here to...

7194
06:13:35,090 --> 06:13:36,870
Wait, isn't that guy...

7195
06:13:36,870 --> 06:13:38,670
Wasn't he the guy that went...

7196
06:13:38,670 --> 06:13:39,550
Captain America?

7197
06:13:41,850 --> 06:13:43,070
Isn't that him?

7198
06:13:43,510 --> 06:13:44,970
Wait, isn't that the portal guy?

7199
06:13:45,750 --> 06:13:47,010
Wait, that's the portal guy!

7200
06:13:47,150 --> 06:13:47,670
That's him!

7201
06:13:49,730 --> 06:13:50,930
It's Joan!

7202
06:13:53,410 --> 06:13:54,770
It's the portal guy!

7203
06:13:55,210 --> 06:13:56,590
It's the guy I don't remember you!

7204
06:13:58,770 --> 06:14:00,230
That's him from yesterday.

7205
06:14:02,890 --> 06:14:03,530
4...

7206
06:14:03,530 --> 06:14:04,170
3...

7207
06:14:04,170 --> 06:14:04,490
2...

7208
06:14:05,130 --> 06:14:05,550
1!

7209
06:14:06,550 --> 06:14:06,870
TP!

7210
06:14:08,890 --> 06:14:10,430
That was him!

7211
06:14:10,510 --> 06:14:12,530
He was the fucking portal guy!

7212
06:14:14,690 --> 06:14:15,670
That is him!

7213
06:14:15,750 --> 06:14:16,250
I'm wrecked!

7214
06:14:16,650 --> 06:14:17,270
It is him!

7215
06:14:17,710 --> 06:14:19,590
I had a similar experience.

7216
06:14:21,190 --> 06:14:23,290
Oh wait, we didn't ban Bruce Banner.

7217
06:14:23,710 --> 06:14:25,030
Oh, this is bad.

7218
06:14:25,510 --> 06:14:26,570
Oh my god.

7219
06:14:31,810 --> 06:14:32,290
Zerk.

7220
06:14:35,390 --> 06:14:36,450
Oh my god.

7221
06:14:37,590 --> 06:14:38,390
I have Iron Man on me.

7222
06:14:38,750 --> 06:14:39,630
I mean not Iron Man, Hulk.

7223
06:14:48,850 --> 06:14:49,570
Hulk asleep?

7224
06:14:54,990 --> 06:14:55,710
Oh no!

7225
06:14:57,750 --> 06:14:58,230
Please!

7226
06:14:59,270 --> 06:15:00,570
It's so scary!

7227
06:15:02,810 --> 06:15:03,830
I have to reload!

7228
06:15:06,110 --> 06:15:07,530
I'm only solo healing right now.

7229
06:15:09,050 --> 06:15:10,570
I'm looking up for a while.

7230
06:15:11,450 --> 06:15:13,330
Oh my god.

7231
06:15:13,470 --> 06:15:15,910
I have to solo heal this!

7232
06:15:17,010 --> 06:15:20,350
And it's so hard to fucking heal Iron Man!

7233
06:15:21,230 --> 06:15:24,630
When he's fighting a stupid Iron Man 1v1!

7234
06:15:27,890 --> 06:15:30,970
Jesus Christ, this Iron Man 1v1 is so dumb.

7235
06:15:40,200 --> 06:15:42,640
What the fuck?

7236
06:15:44,060 --> 06:15:45,660
Is it worth ulting?

7237
06:15:45,800 --> 06:15:46,500
I don't think so.

7238
06:15:51,300 --> 06:15:52,700
Oh my god!

7239
06:15:53,060 --> 06:15:55,520
Remedy is not playing Scarlet!

7240
06:15:55,780 --> 06:15:57,420
He wants to win!

7241
06:15:58,260 --> 06:15:59,320
He actually...

7242
06:15:59,980 --> 06:16:01,580
Holy shit!

7243
06:16:02,080 --> 06:16:04,180
What happened to all my...

7244
06:16:04,180 --> 06:16:04,940
Oh my god!

7245
06:16:04,940 --> 06:16:06,100
What are my Qs?

7246
06:16:07,220 --> 06:16:08,120
I'm gonna ult this.

7247
06:16:11,660 --> 06:16:13,320
Actually, what are my Qs?

7248
06:16:13,480 --> 06:16:14,580
This is actually crazy.

7249
06:16:18,300 --> 06:16:19,200
Hulk has ult.

7250
06:16:24,730 --> 06:16:25,450
I have ult.

7251
06:16:25,590 --> 06:16:26,250
Hulk on me.

7252
06:16:28,430 --> 06:16:29,250
Don't wake up!

7253
06:16:29,470 --> 06:16:29,810
Please!

7254
06:16:30,330 --> 06:16:30,650
Hulk 1!

7255
06:16:35,710 --> 06:16:37,310
Oh my god!

7256
06:16:39,310 --> 06:16:39,830
Oh my god!

7257
06:16:39,830 --> 06:16:41,110
Did I stop his ult?

7258
06:16:41,710 --> 06:16:42,270
His ult?

7259
06:16:42,730 --> 06:16:43,490
It's Hulk.

7260
06:16:50,310 --> 06:16:52,950
I feel like I stopped it, but I'm not sure.

7261
06:17:00,750 --> 06:17:01,410
I'm gonna cut him.

7262
06:17:03,610 --> 06:17:04,530
Oh my god!

7263
06:17:07,310 --> 06:17:08,350
Jesus Christ!

7264
06:17:08,730 --> 06:17:09,810
There's a Hulk behind us.

7265
06:17:10,270 --> 06:17:10,630
He's 1.

7266
06:17:10,730 --> 06:17:11,030
He's 1.

7267
06:17:11,030 --> 06:17:12,230
He's asleep too.

7268
06:17:13,790 --> 06:17:15,670
Oh, he was so close!

7269
06:17:17,510 --> 06:17:18,550
I'm not gonna look.

7270
06:17:24,630 --> 06:17:26,810
There's an Iron Man behind us.

7271
06:17:28,090 --> 06:17:28,490
He's low.

7272
06:17:40,650 --> 06:17:42,830
The stupid Hulk!

7273
06:17:44,130 --> 06:17:44,890
Hulk is low.

7274
06:17:44,950 --> 06:17:45,470
Hulk is 1.

7275
06:17:50,940 --> 06:17:52,660
I got punted.

7276
06:17:53,320 --> 06:17:54,460
You have no supports.

7277
06:18:01,470 --> 06:18:02,190
Oh my god!

7278
06:18:02,230 --> 06:18:02,830
He's going in!

7279
06:18:06,530 --> 06:18:08,950
I was gonna ult if he stayed there.

7280
06:18:14,120 --> 06:18:14,600
Weirdo.

7281
06:18:15,680 --> 06:18:16,160
Hahaha!

7282
06:18:17,800 --> 06:18:18,280
Alright.

7283
06:18:19,060 --> 06:18:20,360
Oh, I thought that was magic move.

7284
06:18:20,840 --> 06:18:21,420
For some reason.

7285
06:18:22,580 --> 06:18:23,760
I'll ult this.

7286
06:18:26,500 --> 06:18:27,080
Hulk 1!

7287
06:18:34,240 --> 06:18:36,020
There's an Iron Man behind here!

7288
06:18:37,900 --> 06:18:39,020
He's looking for ult.

7289
06:18:46,300 --> 06:18:47,500
Oh my god!

7290
06:18:47,660 --> 06:18:48,160
I slept him!

7291
06:18:51,560 --> 06:18:52,280
Hulk 1!

7292
06:18:52,460 --> 06:18:52,620
Hulk 1!

7293
06:18:52,700 --> 06:18:53,060
Hulk 1!

7294
06:18:53,820 --> 06:18:54,980
He was so low.

7295
06:18:55,180 --> 06:18:55,480
Nevermind.

7296
06:19:00,900 --> 06:19:01,340
Hulk half!

7297
06:19:05,780 --> 06:19:06,400
What?!

7298
06:19:06,400 --> 06:19:07,580
What happened?

7299
06:19:07,900 --> 06:19:08,980
There's a map change!

7300
06:19:12,340 --> 06:19:13,690
What the fuck?!

7301
06:19:14,600 --> 06:19:16,040
Oh my god!

7302
06:19:16,080 --> 06:19:17,730
What the fuck was that eye?!

7303
06:19:21,160 --> 06:19:23,520
I couldn't see the ult!

7304
06:19:23,520 --> 06:19:24,580
The ult didn't hit!

7305
06:19:27,680 --> 06:19:28,080
He's asleep.

7306
06:19:35,550 --> 06:19:37,230
Oh my god, please.

7307
06:19:38,830 --> 06:19:40,470
There's a Hulk harassing us on the backline.

7308
06:19:42,710 --> 06:19:44,630
He's asleep, he's asleep.

7309
06:19:46,270 --> 06:19:47,910
Oh my god!

7310
06:19:50,310 --> 06:19:52,610
Did you just got sniped?!

7311
06:19:53,250 --> 06:19:55,910
The eye fucked me up!

7312
06:19:56,670 --> 06:19:59,050
The eye like...

7313
06:19:59,050 --> 06:20:02,090
Cause I heard half of it, so I was like, oh it's gone.

7314
06:20:02,270 --> 06:20:02,910
And then like...

7315
06:20:04,110 --> 06:20:05,650
Oh my god!

7316
06:20:06,490 --> 06:20:08,690
You swap, I swap.

7317
06:20:09,090 --> 06:20:09,930
He wasn't even...

7318
06:20:09,930 --> 06:20:10,370
It wasn't...

7319
06:20:10,910 --> 06:20:11,370
Word?

7320
06:20:12,150 --> 06:20:13,030
I didn't think...

7321
06:20:13,690 --> 06:20:15,910
Do you really think he's gonna swap?

7322
06:20:21,610 --> 06:20:24,250
I'm gonna leave him.

7323
06:20:25,910 --> 06:20:27,130
I'm gonna leave him.

7324
06:20:31,730 --> 06:20:32,130
Damn.

7325
06:20:32,790 --> 06:20:35,510
There's no such thing as time.

7326
06:20:36,550 --> 06:20:40,470
There's no such thing as time in Marvel Rivals.

7327
06:20:40,750 --> 06:20:41,630
It's just grind.

7328
06:20:42,170 --> 06:20:44,470
It's all about the grind, baby.

7329
06:20:45,070 --> 06:20:46,570
It's all about the grind.

7330
06:20:56,010 --> 06:20:57,730
I'm not gonna fall off this time.

7331
06:21:00,780 --> 06:21:01,580
I'm scared.

7332
06:21:07,040 --> 06:21:11,220
This Ironman vs Ironman is so fucking stupid, dude.

7333
06:21:11,320 --> 06:21:12,100
Not gonna lie.

7334
06:21:13,160 --> 06:21:13,960
I'm getting...

7335
06:21:13,960 --> 06:21:14,700
I'm gonna ult this.

7336
06:21:15,100 --> 06:21:15,820
And win this fight.

7337
06:21:19,460 --> 06:21:20,800
Oh man, no more ults.

7338
06:21:21,780 --> 06:21:22,660
Hulk on me, Hulk!

7339
06:21:25,280 --> 06:21:26,220
We can leave him, Bruce Banner.

7340
06:21:26,380 --> 06:21:27,060
We can leave him there.

7341
06:21:28,140 --> 06:21:28,880
Nah.

7342
06:21:36,750 --> 06:21:37,610
Oh, he did...

7343
06:21:37,610 --> 06:21:39,590
He did do the gentleman's agreement.

7344
06:21:40,430 --> 06:21:41,210
That's fucked.

7345
06:21:47,720 --> 06:21:49,260
That's actually fucked.

7346
06:21:52,400 --> 06:21:54,760
He actually believed!

7347
06:21:55,780 --> 06:21:57,220
That's so sad!

7348
06:21:57,540 --> 06:21:58,460
Ironman behind.

7349
06:21:59,410 --> 06:22:00,380
Yeah, Ironman has ult.

7350
06:22:00,840 --> 06:22:01,600
He's looking for it.

7351
06:22:06,660 --> 06:22:09,020
Oh, it's only me supporting.

7352
06:22:13,210 --> 06:22:15,050
He's so low, the Ironman.

7353
06:22:16,370 --> 06:22:18,310
Oh my god.

7354
06:22:18,750 --> 06:22:20,750
He lost hope in humanity.

7355
06:22:21,490 --> 06:22:23,550
He actually lost hope.

7356
06:22:25,230 --> 06:22:26,510
Oh, they used rocket ult.

7357
06:22:29,370 --> 06:22:30,590
He actually...

7358
06:22:30,590 --> 06:22:32,750
Now he hates the world.

7359
06:22:33,330 --> 06:22:35,970
Now he'll never believe anymore.

7360
06:22:37,210 --> 06:22:39,490
He'll never believe anymore.

7361
06:22:39,730 --> 06:22:41,070
Oh my god, what the fuck?

7362
06:22:43,570 --> 06:22:44,910
Wait, what is he doing?

7363
06:22:45,030 --> 06:22:45,670
Remedy's just...

7364
06:22:46,190 --> 06:22:46,750
AMK!

7365
06:22:46,930 --> 06:22:47,710
I got confused.

7366
06:22:47,810 --> 06:22:49,090
I thought he was gonna move.

7367
06:22:49,530 --> 06:22:51,290
I got so confused.

7368
06:22:51,630 --> 06:22:53,010
I was like, why is he not moving?

7369
06:22:57,290 --> 06:22:58,270
Oh my god.

7370
06:22:59,790 --> 06:23:02,150
I legitimately thought he was gonna move.

7371
06:23:06,210 --> 06:23:07,970
We could back up and kite it.

7372
06:23:10,030 --> 06:23:11,110
Oh, goodbye.

7373
06:23:12,330 --> 06:23:13,370
I'm backing up.

7374
06:23:18,360 --> 06:23:19,040
I'm gonna win it.

7375
06:23:19,080 --> 06:23:19,520
I'm gonna ult this.

7376
06:23:19,720 --> 06:23:20,260
You guys are all low.

7377
06:23:25,580 --> 06:23:26,680
Oh shit, nice.

7378
06:23:27,180 --> 06:23:27,940
Let's see who does two picks.

7379
06:23:28,080 --> 06:23:28,520
Let's push up.

7380
06:23:30,580 --> 06:23:30,980
I'm on...

7381
06:23:30,980 --> 06:23:31,900
Magnil's half.

7382
06:23:31,980 --> 06:23:32,560
Magnil's one.

7383
06:23:32,880 --> 06:23:33,300
Or low.

7384
06:23:34,560 --> 06:23:34,980
I have him.

7385
06:23:35,800 --> 06:23:36,340
He's one.

7386
06:23:37,620 --> 06:23:38,420
He's one.

7387
06:23:38,420 --> 06:23:38,620
He's one.

7388
06:23:43,160 --> 06:23:44,680
That poor Bruce Banner.

7389
06:23:45,580 --> 06:23:46,340
Why are you so low?

7390
06:23:50,990 --> 06:23:51,930
Oh my god.

7391
06:23:54,990 --> 06:23:56,590
This is scary.

7392
06:23:59,510 --> 06:24:00,570
He's low, he's low.

7393
06:24:04,630 --> 06:24:05,150
Alright.

7394
06:24:08,830 --> 06:24:09,390
Woah.

7395
06:24:11,850 --> 06:24:12,530
Wait, is that huge?

7396
06:24:12,610 --> 06:24:13,170
I can't tell.

7397
06:24:13,230 --> 06:24:13,930
I can't see anything.

7398
06:24:15,230 --> 06:24:18,550
There's so many things going on!

7399
06:24:24,640 --> 06:24:26,800
Oh, I don't wanna get again.

7400
06:24:26,920 --> 06:24:28,340
I'm gonna farm leaves off of him.

7401
06:24:28,340 --> 06:24:29,660
What's going on?

7402
06:24:29,780 --> 06:24:30,200
Who's that?

7403
06:24:30,800 --> 06:24:31,300
Oh no!

7404
06:24:36,930 --> 06:24:37,990
You have no supports.

7405
06:24:38,130 --> 06:24:38,670
You have no supports.

7406
06:24:40,710 --> 06:24:42,050
What is that?

7407
06:24:43,250 --> 06:24:44,490
I was like...

7408
06:24:44,490 --> 06:24:45,410
Oh my god, wait a minute.

7409
06:24:45,630 --> 06:24:47,130
That sounds really close.

7410
06:24:48,170 --> 06:24:52,930
I was like, wait a minute.

7411
06:24:54,750 --> 06:24:56,930
That sounds too close.

7412
06:24:57,890 --> 06:24:58,510
I slept him.

7413
06:25:00,250 --> 06:25:01,910
I melted my eye.

7414
06:25:05,410 --> 06:25:06,290
Oh, fuck.

7415
06:25:06,370 --> 06:25:06,950
What are you doing?

7416
06:25:07,470 --> 06:25:08,010
Loki, Loki.

7417
06:25:11,370 --> 06:25:11,750
Alright.

7418
06:25:12,110 --> 06:25:12,670
Nice.

7419
06:25:14,090 --> 06:25:14,890
He's behind...

7420
06:25:14,890 --> 06:25:16,150
That's like...

7421
06:25:16,150 --> 06:25:17,450
He's behind me, isn't he?

7422
06:25:22,070 --> 06:25:24,010
Alright, thank you for the five gifted subs.

7423
06:25:24,170 --> 06:25:25,090
Thank you.

7424
06:25:25,090 --> 06:25:26,090
Thank you.

7425
06:25:27,590 --> 06:25:29,350
The audio's good in this game.

7426
06:25:29,430 --> 06:25:30,250
It's really good.

7427
06:25:30,950 --> 06:25:31,710
Honestly.

7428
06:25:32,210 --> 06:25:34,950
Which is crazy, because I'm just thinking like...

7429
06:25:34,950 --> 06:25:36,410
It's been four plus years.

7430
06:25:36,610 --> 06:25:36,750
What?

7431
06:25:38,010 --> 06:25:38,390
Can't...

7432
06:25:38,770 --> 06:25:40,030
Two points.

7433
06:25:40,950 --> 06:25:42,550
Two fucking points!

7434
06:25:47,490 --> 06:25:49,390
Literally two points!

7435
06:25:49,390 --> 06:25:50,110
I died!

7436
06:25:55,090 --> 06:25:56,430
So close.

7437
06:25:57,290 --> 06:25:59,110
So close, yet so far.

7438
06:26:00,910 --> 06:26:02,590
Oh my god.

7439
06:26:05,190 --> 06:26:08,270
We were so close, and yet so far.

7440
06:26:14,590 --> 06:26:15,350
Okay.

7441
06:26:15,510 --> 06:26:20,790
Okay, the Ironman versus Ironman fight was actually so fucking stupid to watch.

7442
06:26:22,010 --> 06:26:24,510
The worst part is that the...

7443
06:26:24,510 --> 06:26:25,210
I have to...

7444
06:26:25,210 --> 06:26:28,730
I don't want to watch it, because it's so stupid.

7445
06:26:29,110 --> 06:26:32,410
But I have to, because I have to heal him.

7446
06:26:32,930 --> 06:26:36,870
I have to heal the fucker.

7447
06:26:38,270 --> 06:26:40,130
They look like they're just...

7448
06:26:40,130 --> 06:26:42,050
Yeah, it's actually so dumb.

7449
06:26:45,930 --> 06:26:48,930
It's just two flies just be like...

7450
06:26:53,790 --> 06:26:57,490
We have to watch it together, too.

7451
06:27:02,790 --> 06:27:05,950
That shit was so fucking dumb.

7452
06:27:08,950 --> 06:27:10,410
I'm here from the group...

7453
06:27:10,410 --> 06:27:11,270
No, it's just...

7454
06:27:11,810 --> 06:27:13,950
Guys, it's just six days.

7455
06:27:14,450 --> 06:27:15,110
Or...

7456
06:27:15,110 --> 06:27:17,850
Guys, like I said, it could be sooner.

7457
06:27:18,630 --> 06:27:20,190
If we get to...

7458
06:27:20,190 --> 06:27:21,470
It could be sooner.

7459
06:27:21,630 --> 06:27:22,790
We could get top...

7460
06:27:22,790 --> 06:27:24,510
We could secure top 500.

7461
06:27:25,430 --> 06:27:26,090
Guys.

7462
06:27:27,850 --> 06:27:29,310
Guys, we could...

7463
06:27:29,310 --> 06:27:30,830
We could get it sooner.

7464
06:27:43,140 --> 06:27:44,160
Where's Remedy?

7465
06:27:45,000 --> 06:27:46,350
Where Remedy go?

7466
06:27:47,220 --> 06:27:48,020
No.

7467
06:27:49,440 --> 06:27:51,240
Where did Remedy go?

7468
06:27:55,420 --> 06:27:56,460
Remedy.

7469
06:28:01,720 --> 06:28:03,420
Alright, we have a Bruce player.

7470
06:28:04,580 --> 06:28:05,480
We have Hootie.

7471
06:28:06,000 --> 06:28:07,140
Hootie on Mars.

7472
06:28:10,720 --> 06:28:13,220
Oh my god.

7473
06:28:19,140 --> 06:28:22,000
He doesn't want to do it all again.

7474
06:28:22,200 --> 06:28:24,120
Oh no, we didn't get the...

7475
06:28:24,120 --> 06:28:25,480
Oh, imagine if we did.

7476
06:28:25,640 --> 06:28:27,960
He's like, I don't want to play Iron, man.

7477
06:28:33,580 --> 06:28:35,060
He's just like...

7478
06:28:35,720 --> 06:28:35,960
Please.

7479
06:28:36,580 --> 06:28:38,760
I don't want to do this all over again.

7480
06:28:41,620 --> 06:28:43,300
He's ironed out, man.

7481
06:28:44,120 --> 06:28:44,880
What's my main?

7482
06:28:45,360 --> 06:28:45,880
Just support.

7483
06:28:45,980 --> 06:28:46,940
Oh shit, they did it.

7484
06:28:46,940 --> 06:28:48,480
Shoutout to you guys.

7485
06:28:53,600 --> 06:28:55,300
Shoutout to you guys.

7486
06:29:00,490 --> 06:29:01,810
Alright, here we go.

7487
06:29:06,140 --> 06:29:08,520
I'm just a support main.

7488
06:29:09,700 --> 06:29:10,560
Cause like...

7489
06:29:11,500 --> 06:29:14,020
I don't like making it easy for myself.

7490
06:29:15,700 --> 06:29:16,930
I don't...

7491
06:29:17,120 --> 06:29:19,040
I don't like...

7492
06:29:19,040 --> 06:29:20,860
I don't like...

7493
06:29:20,860 --> 06:29:22,020
I don't like...

7494
06:29:22,020 --> 06:29:23,000
I don't... You know what?

7495
06:29:24,340 --> 06:29:28,120
I hate it when it's too easy, so I decided to become a support player.

7496
06:29:33,640 --> 06:29:34,600
Key quotes.

7497
06:29:35,720 --> 06:29:36,080
Support.

7498
06:29:36,980 --> 06:29:38,920
You know, I just hate fun.

7499
06:29:39,140 --> 06:29:40,040
That's really it.

7500
06:29:40,820 --> 06:29:42,580
No, actually no, I'm not a tank main.

7501
06:29:43,020 --> 06:29:45,100
I'm not a tank main, so I...

7502
06:29:45,100 --> 06:29:47,080
So like, tank mains hate fun.

7503
06:29:47,900 --> 06:29:50,360
Tank mains just want to get beat up in the frontline.

7504
06:29:50,360 --> 06:29:53,300
And I just like watching it happen.

7505
06:29:56,640 --> 06:29:58,480
Support is one of the... I feel like support is one of the hardest.

7506
06:29:59,180 --> 06:29:59,540
Look at I am.

7507
06:30:00,220 --> 06:30:00,780
Hi, ammo.

7508
06:30:03,080 --> 06:30:04,840
Just cause like...

7509
06:30:04,840 --> 06:30:05,160
Oh.

7510
06:30:05,480 --> 06:30:05,920
Okay.

7511
06:30:06,940 --> 06:30:07,920
Who do you seed?

7512
06:30:08,620 --> 06:30:08,960
Oh.

7513
06:30:11,200 --> 06:30:11,680
Goodbye...

7514
06:30:13,240 --> 06:30:14,200
Goodbye, Romasin.

7515
06:30:14,680 --> 06:30:16,360
We're just gonna play it just in case.

7516
06:30:17,080 --> 06:30:17,640
You know?

7517
06:30:19,460 --> 06:30:20,720
Just in case.

7518
06:30:21,300 --> 06:30:22,800
Just in case he's like...

7519
06:30:23,420 --> 06:30:24,640
He comes back after...

7520
06:30:25,580 --> 06:30:26,020
I don't know.

7521
06:30:26,080 --> 06:30:26,740
I don't believe.

7522
06:30:27,720 --> 06:30:30,920
I don't believe that, you know...

7523
06:30:31,680 --> 06:30:33,560
He like does...

7524
06:30:33,560 --> 06:30:35,580
He like actually is for real, real.

7525
06:30:36,180 --> 06:30:37,120
Hey, it's even now.

7526
06:30:38,860 --> 06:30:39,880
It's even now.

7527
06:30:41,940 --> 06:30:43,760
You know, anything can happen.

7528
06:30:44,920 --> 06:30:47,620
Anything fucked up can happen, I believe.

7529
06:30:48,520 --> 06:30:49,280
Alright.

7530
06:30:49,840 --> 06:30:50,660
Is that a minute yet?

7531
06:30:51,300 --> 06:30:51,600
Yep.

7532
06:30:51,640 --> 06:30:52,900
I fucking knew it!

7533
06:30:53,000 --> 06:30:54,300
I knew it!

7534
06:30:54,520 --> 06:30:56,500
I fucking knew it.

7535
06:30:56,880 --> 06:30:58,620
I never believed.

7536
06:30:59,060 --> 06:31:00,260
I never believed.

7537
06:31:00,900 --> 06:31:01,980
I wasn't gonna troll.

7538
06:31:08,780 --> 06:31:10,740
Oh my god.

7539
06:31:11,380 --> 06:31:12,300
I fucking knew it.

7540
06:31:12,420 --> 06:31:14,360
Never believed.

7541
06:31:15,220 --> 06:31:16,920
Always be pessimistic.

7542
06:31:17,640 --> 06:31:18,440
I'm all this in.

7543
06:31:22,380 --> 06:31:23,760
That's fucking right.

7544
06:31:25,700 --> 06:31:26,280
That's huge.

7545
06:31:26,480 --> 06:31:26,680
That's huge.

7546
06:31:27,540 --> 06:31:27,940
Nice.

7547
06:31:28,860 --> 06:31:30,540
There's a Hulk behind us, sleeping.

7548
06:31:31,060 --> 06:31:31,940
He's a Frozen now, too.

7549
06:31:37,050 --> 06:31:38,090
Strange has ult here.

7550
06:31:40,350 --> 06:31:41,390
I knew it.

7551
06:31:41,850 --> 06:31:43,090
I knew it.

7552
06:31:43,470 --> 06:31:45,370
I knew he would come back and then...

7553
06:31:45,370 --> 06:31:46,750
What if I just get crushed right now?

7554
06:31:47,370 --> 06:31:48,710
I could have just got...

7555
06:31:48,710 --> 06:31:50,350
I actually almost got crushed right there.

7556
06:31:51,030 --> 06:31:52,950
Oh my god, it was right there.

7557
06:31:57,090 --> 06:31:58,410
That's why you gotta...

7558
06:31:59,170 --> 06:32:03,730
That's why you have to always play as if they'll come back and fuck you over.

7559
06:32:07,370 --> 06:32:08,390
Alright, here we go.

7560
06:32:12,430 --> 06:32:13,070
That's fine.

7561
06:32:13,330 --> 06:32:14,590
You're so healthy.

7562
06:32:15,290 --> 06:32:16,050
Strange is looking for an ult.

7563
06:32:17,410 --> 06:32:18,190
There's a Hulk.

7564
06:32:18,450 --> 06:32:19,030
Oh, Hulk is one.

7565
06:32:19,110 --> 06:32:19,490
Hulk is one.

7566
06:32:19,610 --> 06:32:20,010
I got Hulk.

7567
06:32:23,470 --> 06:32:25,330
Oh my god, he's trying.

7568
06:32:25,750 --> 06:32:27,210
Oh my god!

7569
06:32:27,770 --> 06:32:28,590
Manta's one shot.

7570
06:32:28,990 --> 06:32:29,670
I'm scared.

7571
06:32:30,410 --> 06:32:31,210
I have to reload.

7572
06:32:33,750 --> 06:32:34,910
Oh my god!

7573
06:32:35,510 --> 06:32:36,970
Fuck that guy in particular!

7574
06:32:38,050 --> 06:32:38,670
Manta's low.

7575
06:32:39,510 --> 06:32:40,050
Got her.

7576
06:32:40,910 --> 06:32:42,050
He wasn't low, I lied.

7577
06:32:42,270 --> 06:32:43,470
But he doesn't know that.

7578
06:32:43,850 --> 06:32:45,590
He killed him thinking she was low.

7579
06:32:45,590 --> 06:32:47,190
One more, one more.

7580
06:32:47,190 --> 06:32:51,090
But he didn't know that.

7581
06:32:56,710 --> 06:32:59,170
He thought he was low.

7582
06:33:09,040 --> 06:33:10,780
I told you.

7583
06:33:11,100 --> 06:33:12,540
You always stay there one.

7584
06:33:13,040 --> 06:33:13,980
So don't poke.

7585
06:33:14,080 --> 06:33:14,920
That's the strat.

7586
06:33:15,600 --> 06:33:17,500
You can Manta's ult first.

7587
06:33:20,700 --> 06:33:21,560
That's what...

7588
06:33:21,560 --> 06:33:21,900
Did you say Strangel?

7589
06:33:23,820 --> 06:33:24,820
You know, I...

7590
06:33:24,820 --> 06:33:25,280
That's you?

7591
06:33:25,560 --> 06:33:26,000
Yeah.

7592
06:33:31,760 --> 06:33:33,360
Oh my god.

7593
06:33:36,140 --> 06:33:37,180
This is it.

7594
06:33:37,320 --> 06:33:38,260
But why?

7595
06:33:38,540 --> 06:33:40,340
Because this guy...

7596
06:33:40,340 --> 06:33:42,120
Wait, we just used both support ults.

7597
06:33:42,280 --> 06:33:42,580
GG.

7598
06:33:42,580 --> 06:33:43,660
Hehehehehe.

7599
06:33:48,360 --> 06:33:49,000
Damn.

7600
06:33:50,160 --> 06:33:50,700
Huge ult.

7601
06:33:53,440 --> 06:33:56,260
He's playing fucking Ranked at 5 in the morning.

7602
06:33:56,460 --> 06:33:57,520
Of course he's lost it.

7603
06:33:57,580 --> 06:33:59,700
I've lost it since I started streaming.

7604
06:34:03,420 --> 06:34:04,900
See that ult?

7605
06:34:04,980 --> 06:34:05,540
Huge ult.

7606
06:34:06,760 --> 06:34:07,840
Huge fucking ult.

7607
06:34:09,480 --> 06:34:13,880
Honestly, I would have not been surprised if he actually threw us off the cliff.

7608
06:34:15,140 --> 06:34:15,220
Yeah.

7609
06:34:15,840 --> 06:34:16,620
Tyloc behind us.

7610
06:34:20,280 --> 06:34:21,100
Tyloc won't.

7611
06:34:22,900 --> 06:34:23,140
Oh.

7612
06:34:23,780 --> 06:34:24,100
Hulk?

7613
06:34:24,420 --> 06:34:24,780
Oh, nevermind.

7614
06:34:26,240 --> 06:34:27,440
He was...

7615
06:34:27,440 --> 06:34:28,280
Uh, change TP.

7616
06:34:29,020 --> 06:34:29,920
I got it.

7617
06:34:33,240 --> 06:34:34,460
Oh my god.

7618
06:34:35,380 --> 06:34:36,040
Oh my...

7619
06:34:36,040 --> 06:34:37,120
It's like reflex now.

7620
06:34:37,840 --> 06:34:39,520
It's an actual reflex now.

7621
06:34:39,620 --> 06:34:41,040
I play this way too much.

7622
06:34:43,200 --> 06:34:44,480
Oh, I thought...

7623
06:34:44,480 --> 06:34:45,300
Oh, it's Joe!

7624
06:34:45,940 --> 06:34:47,120
Fuck you, Joe!

7625
06:34:47,240 --> 06:34:49,160
I lost too many games with you!

7626
06:34:52,740 --> 06:34:54,680
Actually, fuck you, Joe.

7627
06:35:02,330 --> 06:35:03,780
Was that Emo?

7628
06:35:04,970 --> 06:35:05,730
Eat it!

7629
06:35:08,350 --> 06:35:09,510
Poor Joe.

7630
06:35:09,510 --> 06:35:11,010
I'm gonna play this.

7631
06:35:14,840 --> 06:35:17,740
He's lost me too many games.

7632
06:35:18,020 --> 06:35:18,600
I'm dead.

7633
06:35:18,720 --> 06:35:19,080
Goodbye.

7634
06:35:23,240 --> 06:35:23,880
Goodbye.

7635
06:35:28,830 --> 06:35:30,110
Oh my god.

7636
06:35:30,630 --> 06:35:31,550
She's surviving.

7637
06:35:33,890 --> 06:35:35,030
Please be...

7638
06:35:35,030 --> 06:35:37,510
I'm sorry to tell you this, but Jeff is not meta.

7639
06:35:37,770 --> 06:35:38,490
I'm sorry.

7640
06:35:42,810 --> 06:35:43,890
I'm sorry.

7641
06:35:44,530 --> 06:35:45,110
I'm sorry, buddy.

7642
06:35:45,690 --> 06:35:46,850
Jeff is like...

7643
06:35:46,850 --> 06:35:48,190
Is not it.

7644
06:35:49,030 --> 06:35:49,750
Oh my god!

7645
06:35:49,790 --> 06:35:51,910
The stupid fucking map!

7646
06:35:56,350 --> 06:35:56,930
Fucking...

7647
06:35:56,930 --> 06:35:57,810
Oh, nice.

7648
06:35:59,970 --> 06:36:01,890
Oh, I think we might need a backup here.

7649
06:36:02,430 --> 06:36:02,750
I don't know.

7650
06:36:02,790 --> 06:36:03,270
It's winnable.

7651
06:36:06,710 --> 06:36:08,110
Yep, it's not.

7652
06:36:11,930 --> 06:36:15,110
Sorry, buddy.

7653
06:36:15,270 --> 06:36:16,930
You gotta find a Jeff 1 trick.

7654
06:36:17,350 --> 06:36:18,770
No Jeff players here.

7655
06:36:18,950 --> 06:36:19,470
This is...

7656
06:36:19,470 --> 06:36:21,770
This is eternally GM 1 lobby.

7657
06:36:24,830 --> 06:36:28,550
You gotta find a Jeff 1 trick if you want a Jeff gameplay.

7658
06:36:36,610 --> 06:36:37,730
This is Jeff...

7659
06:36:37,730 --> 06:36:38,930
Oh shit!

7660
06:36:39,270 --> 06:36:41,890
I looked at my chat and she's dead.

7661
06:36:42,210 --> 06:36:43,750
Like, what happened?

7662
06:36:45,170 --> 06:36:45,930
Oh, Hulk is low.

7663
06:36:46,210 --> 06:36:46,690
Hulk is 1.

7664
06:36:46,730 --> 06:36:47,210
Hulk is 1.

7665
06:36:48,070 --> 06:36:48,950
He's getting healed.

7666
06:36:53,050 --> 06:36:53,850
Hulk is off.

7667
06:36:56,250 --> 06:36:57,510
I froze her.

7668
06:37:04,650 --> 06:37:06,670
Oh my god, how is he...

7669
06:37:06,670 --> 06:37:07,910
Wait, Hulk is so low.

7670
06:37:10,710 --> 06:37:12,550
We need Mantis ult first if we need it.

7671
06:37:15,730 --> 06:37:17,130
Fuck this lamp in general.

7672
06:37:19,590 --> 06:37:20,710
Oh, goodbye.

7673
06:37:22,450 --> 06:37:23,010
Goodbye.

7674
06:37:23,950 --> 06:37:24,490
Oh, nice.

7675
06:37:26,750 --> 06:37:27,790
There's a Hulk turret right?

7676
06:37:28,450 --> 06:37:29,410
Yeah, he's froze.

7677
06:37:32,130 --> 06:37:33,210
Oh my god.

7678
06:37:33,830 --> 06:37:34,830
Sorry, I didn't see.

7679
06:37:34,830 --> 06:37:36,670
I am ready to put on a show.

7680
06:37:37,390 --> 06:37:38,990
We gotta play on point if we can.

7681
06:37:41,510 --> 06:37:42,490
Oh my god.

7682
06:37:44,290 --> 06:37:45,410
Let's use this to heal Junk.

7683
06:37:48,630 --> 06:37:50,470
Oh, I'm ulting.

7684
06:37:51,870 --> 06:37:53,870
Oh my god, I'm dancing!

7685
06:37:56,650 --> 06:37:57,650
I'm dancing!

7686
06:38:04,830 --> 06:38:05,910
Oh, is he okay?

7687
06:38:09,950 --> 06:38:11,570
Oh, I'm scared.

7688
06:38:11,730 --> 06:38:12,930
So I'm not gonna look at him.

7689
06:38:15,050 --> 06:38:18,390
Why does everybody fucking hate me today?

7690
06:38:25,330 --> 06:38:25,930
Yo,

7691
06:38:29,970 --> 06:38:30,990
somebody give me a NPC.

7692
06:38:31,470 --> 06:38:33,910
Mace, Hoodie, Doki, any of you.

7693
06:38:34,830 --> 06:38:36,690
I'm a billionaire, I'll buy you a new PC, bro.

7694
06:38:38,610 --> 06:38:42,010
Oh my god, we got Eternity back.

7695
06:38:42,270 --> 06:38:43,950
Oh my god.

7696
06:38:44,750 --> 06:38:49,330
We fucking did it.

7697
06:38:50,490 --> 06:38:52,070
I'm sorry, Joan.

7698
06:38:52,390 --> 06:38:54,970
I'm fucking avoiding you.

7699
06:38:55,090 --> 06:38:57,490
You creeped me too many times.

7700
06:38:57,910 --> 06:39:01,570
Did you guys know there's only like 300 to 400 players in Eternity?

7701
06:39:01,570 --> 06:39:04,910
I know it's crazy to see that.

7702
06:39:05,730 --> 06:39:06,830
That I'm like, no.

7703
06:39:07,290 --> 06:39:07,970
Should we keep going?

7704
06:39:08,070 --> 06:39:09,370
We go until we lose.

7705
06:39:10,650 --> 06:39:11,650
Let's do it.

7706
06:39:17,890 --> 06:39:18,750
Alright, guys.

7707
06:39:18,850 --> 06:39:19,670
Now that...

7708
06:39:19,670 --> 06:39:20,850
Okay, I can do it with Drake.

7709
06:39:20,950 --> 06:39:21,630
Alright, now that...

7710
06:39:22,250 --> 06:39:22,950
Mace is gone.

7711
06:39:24,810 --> 06:39:25,290
But...

7712
06:39:25,290 --> 06:39:27,530
I believe in Drake and I.

7713
06:39:27,770 --> 06:39:30,050
We play until we lose.

7714
06:39:33,290 --> 06:39:35,810
I like how I said that.

7715
06:39:36,790 --> 06:39:37,810
And then...

7716
06:39:37,810 --> 06:39:41,190
And then Mace disappeared.

7717
06:39:43,110 --> 06:39:45,230
That's actually hilarious.

7718
06:39:53,220 --> 06:39:53,940
Alright.

7719
06:39:54,160 --> 06:39:55,680
Wait, actually...

7720
06:39:56,220 --> 06:39:57,340
Oh no, Lau's gone.

7721
06:39:57,840 --> 06:39:59,220
Oh wait, Lau's gone, alright.

7722
06:40:00,980 --> 06:40:03,120
Wait, Mac got Eternity back.

7723
06:40:04,300 --> 06:40:06,880
Oh my god, look at that!

7724
06:40:07,220 --> 06:40:09,380
I fucking always believed in you, Mac.

7725
06:40:10,820 --> 06:40:12,200
Yeah, my gold- wait, wavy?

7726
06:40:12,680 --> 06:40:13,620
Alright, let's see.

7727
06:40:13,760 --> 06:40:14,380
Wait, wait.

7728
06:40:17,240 --> 06:40:18,340
Where is wavy?

7729
06:40:19,760 --> 06:40:21,120
Has he been doing okay?

7730
06:40:21,480 --> 06:40:21,960
Oh.

7731
06:40:23,380 --> 06:40:24,240
GG's, miss.

7732
06:40:24,660 --> 06:40:25,140
GG's.

7733
06:40:25,220 --> 06:40:26,020
I don't know.

7734
06:40:26,280 --> 06:40:27,900
I don't know if he's been doing okay.

7735
06:40:27,980 --> 06:40:28,980
Do we adopt wavy?

7736
06:40:31,140 --> 06:40:32,440
He's being okay.

7737
06:40:34,280 --> 06:40:35,920
Oh, he got off.

7738
06:40:38,940 --> 06:40:42,220
Did he get off after we beat him?

7739
06:40:47,700 --> 06:40:49,780
He was not okay.

7740
06:40:52,160 --> 06:40:52,800
Alright.

7741
06:40:54,880 --> 06:40:56,340
He- is he okay?

7742
06:40:56,560 --> 06:40:57,380
What about remedy?

7743
06:40:57,620 --> 06:40:58,400
Guys, I don't know.

7744
06:40:58,640 --> 06:40:58,960
I don't know.

7745
06:40:58,960 --> 06:40:59,840
I don't know what remedy is.

7746
06:41:01,140 --> 06:41:02,840
I'm gonna add remedy because it was funny.

7747
06:41:04,820 --> 06:41:05,900
Who's half-ish?

7748
06:41:06,620 --> 06:41:07,360
Who is he?

7749
06:41:10,280 --> 06:41:11,400
Did I add this guy?

7750
06:41:11,880 --> 06:41:12,680
Who is he?

7751
06:41:12,840 --> 06:41:14,440
Oh, is it because of the auditions?

7752
06:41:15,980 --> 06:41:20,500
I like- did he get eternity and then fucking send me a friend request because he wanted to audition?

7753
06:41:20,500 --> 06:41:21,340
I-

7754
06:41:25,080 --> 06:41:27,480
Because I said, let's go.

7755
06:41:27,620 --> 06:41:28,640
Let's fucking audition.

7756
06:41:35,600 --> 06:41:36,340
Invite him.

7757
06:41:36,460 --> 06:41:38,260
You need more tanks.

7758
06:41:41,820 --> 06:41:44,020
I thought the job was finished.

7759
06:41:45,500 --> 06:41:47,200
What, you wanna get back in here, mace?

7760
06:41:47,220 --> 06:41:48,300
You went back online.

7761
06:41:49,240 --> 06:41:52,280
Wait, actually I don't even know if he went offline and then came back.

7762
06:41:52,460 --> 06:41:57,700
I don't know if he's like- I sent a call to action tweet.

7763
06:41:58,620 --> 06:42:01,640
We just invite all of the tank players.

7764
06:42:03,320 --> 06:42:07,400
Audition to be- to be our tank player.

7765
06:42:09,720 --> 06:42:10,800
No, he went off.

7766
06:42:10,960 --> 06:42:11,220
Alright.

7767
06:42:11,880 --> 06:42:13,040
That's why we were queued up anyway.

7768
06:42:13,040 --> 06:42:13,620
Okay.

7769
06:42:16,360 --> 06:42:18,040
Job's not done, guys.

7770
06:42:18,220 --> 06:42:20,440
We can't- we always end on a loss.

7771
06:42:25,090 --> 06:42:26,130
Job's not done.

7772
06:42:26,250 --> 06:42:29,130
Yeah, it's like American Idol, but for tanks, basically.

7773
06:42:32,190 --> 06:42:33,930
Oh, did- did that guy?

7774
06:42:39,210 --> 06:42:40,910
Was it with us?

7775
06:42:41,390 --> 06:42:46,230
Oh, I fucking- Oh, sorry.

7776
06:42:47,170 --> 06:42:50,050
I fucking got him off the game.

7777
06:42:52,390 --> 06:42:56,090
He lost against me and he never came back.

7778
06:42:56,750 --> 06:42:59,150
He never came back.

7779
06:43:00,410 --> 06:43:02,130
That poor man.

7780
06:43:04,110 --> 06:43:05,130
I love you.

7781
06:43:09,930 --> 06:43:11,450
Alright, nice.

7782
06:43:14,350 --> 06:43:16,190
I made him log off.

7783
06:43:17,030 --> 06:43:18,430
I def- oh hey, Max here!

7784
06:43:20,350 --> 06:43:22,630
We technically papped the team again.

7785
06:43:23,510 --> 06:43:25,570
I made two people log off.

7786
06:43:33,260 --> 06:43:33,580
Oh.

7787
06:43:44,860 --> 06:43:45,440
No.

7788
06:43:47,640 --> 06:43:51,540
He's actually just sitting like, dude, fuck this map.

7789
06:43:55,140 --> 06:43:56,000
No.

7790
06:43:57,200 --> 06:44:00,820
Mack and Kendrick Lamar, don't fight.

7791
06:44:01,840 --> 06:44:04,040
Don't fight.

7792
06:44:07,840 --> 06:44:10,480
Please stop fighting.

7793
06:44:17,000 --> 06:44:21,480
Please don't fight, Kendrick Lamar and Mack.

7794
06:44:22,280 --> 06:44:24,500
Please don't fight.

7795
06:44:31,470 --> 06:44:36,250
The reason why our stack originally broke up is that these two were fighting.

7796
06:44:37,670 --> 06:44:39,050
These two.

7797
06:44:43,130 --> 06:44:44,130
No.

7798
06:44:44,850 --> 06:44:45,650
No.

7799
06:44:45,650 --> 06:44:45,690
No!

7800
06:44:49,890 --> 06:44:52,330
That happened three hours ago.

7801
06:44:52,730 --> 06:44:57,450
And then I told Drake, I was like, I'll do one game and if we win, we'll keep going.

7802
06:44:58,130 --> 06:45:02,350
I was like, if not, I'm just gonna solo queue because they were fighting each other.

7803
06:45:03,970 --> 06:45:05,310
You're calm now, right?

7804
06:45:06,410 --> 06:45:08,750
Why is everyone beefing each other?

7805
06:45:09,510 --> 06:45:10,770
I have no idea.

7806
06:45:11,610 --> 06:45:14,030
Oh my god, I fucking hate this map.

7807
06:45:17,850 --> 06:45:21,170
Kendrick Lamar did not have a good time.

7808
06:45:21,730 --> 06:45:23,950
No, if I lose, I'm still Eternity.

7809
06:45:23,970 --> 06:45:24,470
I have a buffer.

7810
06:45:25,550 --> 06:45:28,010
I have a buffer right now.

7811
06:45:31,450 --> 06:45:33,110
I'm Eternity now.

7812
06:45:33,790 --> 06:45:35,170
For now, again.

7813
06:45:35,770 --> 06:45:37,410
Another day on Eternity.

7814
06:45:38,190 --> 06:45:40,130
Until I lose it again.

7815
06:45:40,990 --> 06:45:41,530
It's alright.

7816
06:45:42,670 --> 06:45:52,110
We'll just adopt another tank player next- not tomorrow, tomorrow I'm resting from- Actually, my cramp's gone, but I don't want to risk it, you know?

7817
06:45:54,590 --> 06:45:56,490
I don't want to risk it.

7818
06:45:57,450 --> 06:46:06,210
At least, like, Drake vacated, won't complain about the lack of orbs because, like, they're on support.

7819
06:46:07,030 --> 06:46:08,370
I don't think they need it.

7820
06:46:12,830 --> 06:46:13,870
Groot!

7821
06:46:14,050 --> 06:46:14,770
Groot!

7822
06:46:14,830 --> 06:46:15,350
No!

7823
06:46:16,170 --> 06:46:16,670
Groot!

7824
06:46:19,350 --> 06:46:24,570
He said I am Groot for one last time.

7825
06:46:24,810 --> 06:46:28,590
I'm trying to keep you up, Groot.

7826
06:46:29,790 --> 06:46:32,030
Oh my god.

7827
06:46:35,130 --> 06:46:37,470
Oh my god.

7828
06:46:37,470 --> 06:46:38,910
I need to put down Groot.

7829
06:46:39,070 --> 06:46:41,010
This Chunky boy needs fucking heals.

7830
06:46:41,750 --> 06:46:42,770
This Chunky boy.

7831
06:46:43,010 --> 06:46:47,210
This Chunky boy needs to be kept up no matter what.

7832
06:46:47,610 --> 06:46:49,330
Chunky boy, live.

7833
06:46:49,870 --> 06:46:50,250
Please.

7834
06:46:50,970 --> 06:46:53,090
Chunky boy, just live.

7835
06:46:53,870 --> 06:46:56,390
Oh my god, Chunky boy did it.

7836
06:46:57,930 --> 06:46:58,570
He's Grooting.

7837
06:46:58,850 --> 06:47:02,750
He's fucking actually- Okay.

7838
06:47:04,730 --> 06:47:05,490
Okay.

7839
06:47:07,190 --> 06:47:11,870
Okay, my Chunky boy, you live.

7840
06:47:12,850 --> 06:47:14,530
You live.

7841
06:47:16,610 --> 06:47:17,050
Alright.

7842
06:47:19,050 --> 06:47:20,810
She's so ready!

7843
06:47:24,870 --> 06:47:25,670
Why?

7844
06:47:25,910 --> 06:47:27,150
Why didn't you just dance?

7845
06:47:27,210 --> 06:47:28,230
You just live.

7846
06:47:28,610 --> 06:47:30,750
We don't even have a- Why?

7847
06:47:30,750 --> 06:47:35,090
Why did she- Why did she not dance the zone?

7848
06:47:38,250 --> 06:47:41,050
Like, I don't understand.

7849
06:47:43,870 --> 06:47:44,530
Wait.

7850
06:47:45,530 --> 06:47:46,170
Wait.

7851
06:47:46,510 --> 06:47:47,410
Mantis, can you push guard?

7852
06:47:47,510 --> 06:47:48,250
I'm gonna build ult.

7853
06:47:52,600 --> 06:47:54,320
Alright, my turn to build ult.

7854
06:47:56,020 --> 06:47:56,600
Alright.

7855
06:48:00,700 --> 06:48:01,700
I am Groot.

7856
06:48:02,120 --> 06:48:03,360
I am Groot.

7857
06:48:04,920 --> 06:48:05,740
I'm Grooting.

7858
06:48:06,320 --> 06:48:08,580
No, the group brainwashed is hitting right now.

7859
06:48:09,160 --> 06:48:10,560
It's absolutely hitting.

7860
06:48:10,800 --> 06:48:11,620
They have strange ults.

7861
06:48:14,440 --> 06:48:15,540
Oh my god.

7862
06:48:21,020 --> 06:48:22,100
I'm alive.

7863
06:48:24,920 --> 06:48:26,180
Oh, he's so low.

7864
06:48:26,360 --> 06:48:26,760
We're even.

7865
06:48:28,820 --> 06:48:29,360
No!

7866
06:48:29,360 --> 06:48:29,900
Nice!

7867
06:48:31,400 --> 06:48:32,600
Oh, not nice.

7868
06:48:32,720 --> 06:48:33,620
I'm 5% off.

7869
06:48:33,620 --> 06:48:34,060
Ult.

7870
06:48:34,440 --> 06:48:34,960
You guys can live.

7871
06:48:36,180 --> 06:48:36,740
I got it.

7872
06:48:36,780 --> 06:48:36,980
I got it.

7873
06:48:37,020 --> 06:48:37,180
I got it.

7874
06:48:37,300 --> 06:48:37,440
I got it.

7875
06:48:41,360 --> 06:48:42,360
Come on.

7876
06:48:43,200 --> 06:48:44,220
I'm mad.

7877
06:48:44,840 --> 06:48:45,720
I am Groot.

7878
06:48:47,500 --> 06:48:49,400
I am- I'm leaving.

7879
06:48:50,020 --> 06:48:50,660
Groot's leaving.

7880
06:48:52,300 --> 06:48:52,640
No!

7881
06:48:58,620 --> 06:48:59,960
Goodbye, Wakanda.

7882
06:49:01,500 --> 06:49:02,180
Goodbye.

7883
06:49:04,120 --> 06:49:05,860
What the fuck is that portal?

7884
06:49:06,580 --> 06:49:07,480
What are you gonna do there?

7885
06:49:08,460 --> 06:49:09,120
Kill me?

7886
06:49:15,030 --> 06:49:16,010
Oh, not me.

7887
06:49:16,470 --> 06:49:17,010
Him though.

7888
06:49:17,450 --> 06:49:18,390
Him though.

7889
06:49:22,050 --> 06:49:22,890
Him though.

7890
06:49:24,550 --> 06:49:26,110
Oh my god.

7891
06:49:28,530 --> 06:49:29,670
Oh, Groot, please.

7892
06:49:31,590 --> 06:49:33,130
Oh, he's so low, Magneto.

7893
06:49:35,750 --> 06:49:36,710
Oh my god.

7894
06:49:36,770 --> 06:49:38,270
I'm fucking- We're up one.

7895
06:49:38,430 --> 06:49:39,090
We should push up.

7896
06:49:43,460 --> 06:49:44,300
I'm fucking strange.

7897
06:49:44,440 --> 06:49:44,560
Strange.

7898
06:49:44,600 --> 06:49:44,740
Strange.

7899
06:49:45,360 --> 06:49:46,120
Strange on cart.

7900
06:49:48,600 --> 06:49:49,460
Alright, nice.

7901
06:49:51,980 --> 06:49:52,980
Oh, we can Mantis ult first.

7902
06:49:56,380 --> 06:49:57,440
Oh my god.

7903
06:49:59,840 --> 06:50:01,920
What if I just close the door?

7904
06:50:02,200 --> 06:50:02,980
How do I close this door?

7905
06:50:02,980 --> 06:50:05,540
Oh, I almost closed the door against her Mantis.

7906
06:50:05,740 --> 06:50:08,580
That would be so fucking bad.

7907
06:50:18,990 --> 06:50:21,930
Oh my god!

7908
06:50:26,690 --> 06:50:29,870
That tree blocked me!

7909
06:50:31,150 --> 06:50:32,170
Oh my-

7910
06:50:35,570 --> 06:50:37,730
I am stuck!

7911
06:50:40,670 --> 06:50:46,470
Oh my god, it was my own tree too!

7912
06:50:49,940 --> 06:50:51,220
Yeah, because I was dead.

7913
06:50:51,360 --> 06:50:51,940
That was a good ult.

7914
06:50:56,600 --> 06:50:58,700
I am Groot.

7915
06:50:58,900 --> 06:51:01,300
I am Groot.

7916
06:51:02,620 --> 06:51:04,040
I am...

7917
06:51:06,420 --> 06:51:07,780
I am Groot.

7918
06:51:09,160 --> 06:51:10,400
I am Groot.

7919
06:51:11,820 --> 06:51:13,760
The group reroll is hitting right now.

7920
06:51:15,360 --> 06:51:17,460
I don't think Max will miss.

7921
06:51:18,540 --> 06:51:22,940
Unless he's just- He's tweaking right now.

7922
06:51:23,140 --> 06:51:26,360
He's actually- He fucking unlocked his inner Wakanda.

7923
06:51:27,360 --> 06:51:30,300
He unlocked his inner Wakanda.

7924
06:51:32,080 --> 06:51:40,740
Because I remember like, Toast made a tweet and he was like, Is it bad if I save for Wakanda?

7925
06:51:43,260 --> 06:51:45,440
Oh, I don't have ult for this.

7926
06:51:49,050 --> 06:51:55,130
I don't know if you guys saw that fucking tweet from Toast.

7927
06:51:56,770 --> 06:51:57,290
They're all so low!

7928
06:51:57,430 --> 06:51:58,410
They're all- Trina's one!

7929
06:51:58,470 --> 06:51:58,910
Trina's one!

7930
06:52:02,070 --> 06:52:02,630
Trina's one.

7931
06:52:02,630 --> 06:52:03,090
Support low too.

7932
06:52:05,130 --> 06:52:05,650
That's fine.

7933
06:52:06,370 --> 06:52:07,350
That's so fine.

7934
06:52:08,110 --> 06:52:08,990
I'm damage boosting this.

7935
06:52:09,090 --> 06:52:09,550
I'm damage boosting.

7936
06:52:09,990 --> 06:52:10,470
Trina's one.

7937
06:52:11,250 --> 06:52:11,850
Trina's solo.

7938
06:52:14,310 --> 06:52:14,690
Nice.

7939
06:52:18,810 --> 06:52:23,230
Oh god, the first- Wait, I'll read you guys Toast's tweet.

7940
06:52:23,510 --> 06:52:27,410
I saw that and I was like, what the fuck, Toast?

7941
06:52:28,910 --> 06:52:31,410
I'll read you what he wrote.

7942
06:52:32,250 --> 06:52:46,730
He was like, He was like, Fellas, is it socially acceptable for a middle-aged Asian man to yell Wakanda forever after he gets a triple kill as Black Panther on Marvel Rivals?

7943
06:52:51,150 --> 06:52:54,230
I was just like, what the fuck?

7944
06:53:01,490 --> 06:53:03,290
He earned it.

7945
06:53:07,010 --> 06:53:10,070
I was just like, what the fuck, Toast?

7946
06:53:14,500 --> 06:53:17,360
Okay, but it was a triple kill on Black Panther.

7947
06:53:17,600 --> 06:53:19,520
Like, that's impressive.

7948
06:53:22,160 --> 06:53:26,880
Like, as a middle-aged Asian man, I confirm, it is acceptable.

7949
06:53:36,650 --> 06:53:39,470
If I adopt another tank player, I'll keep going.

7950
06:53:42,410 --> 06:53:44,370
Auditions are open yet again.

7951
06:53:50,710 --> 06:53:52,390
Marvel Rivals, sponsor me.

7952
06:53:52,570 --> 06:53:53,370
I have- whoa.

7953
06:53:55,750 --> 06:53:57,070
I'm a degenerate grinder.

7954
06:53:58,810 --> 06:53:59,810
Oh, what up, though?

7955
06:54:02,330 --> 06:54:03,370
Oh.

7956
06:54:04,170 --> 06:54:05,210
Oh.

7957
06:54:05,390 --> 06:54:06,410
Oh, I hope they're okay.

7958
06:54:09,750 --> 06:54:11,510
Hmm, let's bet.

7959
06:54:24,670 --> 06:54:28,250
I looked at the Mantis and I died.

7960
06:54:33,610 --> 06:54:35,190
I looked at him.

7961
06:54:35,870 --> 06:54:36,990
What happened?

7962
06:54:36,990 --> 06:54:38,350
He retouched.

7963
06:54:42,510 --> 06:54:44,790
He got the Scrooge.

7964
06:54:46,690 --> 06:54:50,430
I got- I got died of Black Panther.

7965
06:54:51,650 --> 06:54:58,470
Like I said, he got the Scrooge and then Black Pan- and then he walked past Black Panther.

7966
06:54:59,330 --> 06:55:01,210
Like, what the fuck?

7967
06:55:03,050 --> 06:55:05,570
I thought he- I don't know.

7968
06:55:05,790 --> 06:55:13,190
I thought- I legitimately thought he- You know, he- there's a Black Panther on our Mantis.

7969
06:55:14,450 --> 06:55:15,410
Can I throw a Frozen too?

7970
06:55:19,930 --> 06:55:20,690
We're even.

7971
06:55:29,870 --> 06:55:30,350
Oh.

7972
06:55:30,590 --> 06:55:30,810
Oh.

7973
06:55:32,010 --> 06:55:32,830
That's scary.

7974
06:55:33,030 --> 06:55:35,850
Oh, that's- Oh, helper!

7975
06:55:36,090 --> 06:55:36,650
Helper group.

7976
06:55:36,770 --> 06:55:37,130
Helper group.

7977
06:55:42,770 --> 06:55:44,290
You're full of Hawkeye.

7978
06:55:44,450 --> 06:55:44,950
Hawkeye's one?

7979
06:55:51,680 --> 06:55:54,360
They should still have Strangelord here and Hawkeye.

7980
06:55:57,800 --> 06:55:58,320
Alright.

7981
06:56:00,620 --> 06:56:01,680
Oh, I'm scared.

7982
06:56:02,920 --> 06:56:04,220
Can you top me off real quick, Mantis?

7983
06:56:08,550 --> 06:56:09,670
I'm so scared.

7984
06:56:13,390 --> 06:56:14,670
I'm ulting this one, please.

7985
06:56:17,350 --> 06:56:19,450
Oh my god, I'm damage boosting?

7986
06:56:19,450 --> 06:56:22,940
I'm damage boosting.

7987
06:56:27,220 --> 06:56:30,400
They still have Strangelord.

7988
06:56:32,580 --> 06:56:35,780
Oh my god, this is- he's Grooting.

7989
06:56:40,980 --> 06:56:43,520
Oh, our group looked at it too.

7990
06:56:43,620 --> 06:56:45,840
Our group was looking at him in disappointment.

7991
06:56:46,460 --> 06:56:47,420
He was not happy.

7992
06:56:47,420 --> 06:56:50,700
Did you see our group just looked at it?

7993
06:56:51,280 --> 06:56:53,620
He was like, sir, that happened.

7994
06:56:59,140 --> 06:57:02,840
He was just like, oh man.

7995
06:57:05,360 --> 06:57:07,820
We actually lost that.

7996
06:57:11,320 --> 06:57:12,640
I need to be topped off.

7997
06:57:19,910 --> 06:57:20,970
The more is half?

7998
06:57:21,750 --> 06:57:23,730
Oh my god, if you can ult to stabilize.

7999
06:57:29,110 --> 06:57:29,550
Alright.

8000
06:57:30,170 --> 06:57:31,070
You're down a Luna.

8001
06:57:32,010 --> 06:57:32,930
You're down two.

8002
06:57:35,230 --> 06:57:36,770
I can- if you live, I can ult.

8003
06:57:40,650 --> 06:57:41,090
No!

8004
06:57:43,550 --> 06:57:45,790
Oh my god, I guess I'll try and live on cart.

8005
06:57:47,370 --> 06:57:49,050
Oh my god, I just don't want to get one-shot.

8006
06:57:49,190 --> 06:57:50,570
I just don't want to get one-shot.

8007
06:57:50,750 --> 06:57:53,630
I just don't want to get one-shot by fucking Hawkeye.

8008
06:57:53,670 --> 06:57:56,890
I'm fucking trying my best to not get one-shot by Hawkeye.

8009
06:58:01,130 --> 06:58:07,050
That's why I was like running back and forth because like, Hawkeye's the only character that can one-shot me.

8010
06:58:07,450 --> 06:58:10,430
So I was like, I ain't letting that happen.

8011
06:58:16,010 --> 06:58:17,530
There's a rocket behind.

8012
06:58:18,490 --> 06:58:19,130
He has ult.

8013
06:58:25,050 --> 06:58:31,330
Hawkeye's the only character that can one-shot me out of all- that's why I was like going back and forth.

8014
06:58:31,810 --> 06:58:34,910
I was like, just don't kill me.

8015
06:58:39,630 --> 06:58:41,850
Just don't kill me.

8016
06:58:41,850 --> 06:58:43,050
That was a very sad eye.

8017
06:58:43,170 --> 06:58:43,910
No, it was.

8018
06:58:44,330 --> 06:58:47,890
It was 100% an incredibly sad eye.

8019
06:58:54,670 --> 06:58:56,710
I was not having it.

8020
06:59:00,930 --> 06:59:02,470
Oh my god, he's back.

8021
06:59:03,050 --> 06:59:04,710
The Black Panther's back.

8022
06:59:06,290 --> 06:59:07,570
Black Panther's one.

8023
06:59:08,670 --> 06:59:11,650
Oh, I rooted away.

8024
06:59:13,410 --> 06:59:14,450
I think we can kite this.

8025
06:59:15,430 --> 06:59:16,770
Oh shit, that's huge.

8026
06:59:21,890 --> 06:59:22,230
Oh.

8027
06:59:23,970 --> 06:59:25,950
Oh my god.

8028
06:59:29,610 --> 06:59:30,890
I have ult in five.

8029
06:59:38,030 --> 06:59:39,370
Oh my god.

8030
06:59:39,770 --> 06:59:41,070
Let's go!

8031
06:59:44,330 --> 06:59:45,390
They can still TP.

8032
06:59:51,630 --> 06:59:53,430
They might TP this.

8033
06:59:56,450 --> 06:59:57,310
I'll listen for it.

8034
06:59:57,790 --> 06:59:58,710
It doesn't sound like they are.

8035
07:00:03,450 --> 07:00:03,950
Whoa!

8036
07:00:10,630 --> 07:00:11,650
He's gonna groove.

8037
07:00:12,250 --> 07:00:14,630
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

8038
07:00:14,850 --> 07:00:15,630
I'm gonna ult you here.

8039
07:00:15,630 --> 07:00:18,750
Oh my god, we did it!

8040
07:00:20,030 --> 07:00:21,610
Oh my god.

8041
07:00:25,150 --> 07:00:27,290
Oh my god, he rooted.

8042
07:00:27,790 --> 07:00:29,130
He actually rooted.

8043
07:00:32,090 --> 07:00:35,590
Alright, someone do exclamation point Nuna, why I don't do the tech.

8044
07:00:36,410 --> 07:00:38,630
And why you don't see people do the tech anymore.

8045
07:00:41,790 --> 07:00:42,430
Someone.

8046
07:00:43,150 --> 07:00:44,230
Oh my god.

8047
07:00:45,630 --> 07:00:48,370
Oh my god, they can't work together.

8048
07:00:48,850 --> 07:00:52,010
Oh my god, I'm so...

8049
07:00:52,010 --> 07:00:55,910
But what if we do one more...

8050
07:01:01,850 --> 07:01:04,690
Oh my god, I'm so proud of them.

8051
07:01:08,750 --> 07:01:10,810
I'm so proud.

8052
07:01:11,710 --> 07:01:13,210
They did it.

8053
07:01:13,250 --> 07:01:15,590
They actually worked together.

8054
07:01:23,010 --> 07:01:24,550
Oh my god.

8055
07:01:28,090 --> 07:01:31,570
Oh my god, we can't end on a win.

8056
07:01:32,790 --> 07:01:34,210
We can't, we can't.

8057
07:01:34,270 --> 07:01:36,470
That's not how we do it here.

8058
07:01:36,650 --> 07:01:38,350
Come on, Drake, big hater.

8059
07:01:39,090 --> 07:01:41,350
Come on, one more...

8060
07:01:42,010 --> 07:01:44,230
One more game on the road.

8061
07:01:47,130 --> 07:01:48,250
Come on.

8062
07:01:48,510 --> 07:01:49,550
How long has it been bugged?

8063
07:01:49,910 --> 07:01:52,150
It's been bugged since the second day.

8064
07:01:53,070 --> 07:01:56,350
People don't notice it because...

8065
07:01:59,570 --> 07:02:01,810
We are up though.

8066
07:02:01,970 --> 07:02:03,430
We are up.

8067
07:02:03,690 --> 07:02:04,570
Oh my god.

8068
07:02:05,170 --> 07:02:06,590
Fucking ignore this though.

8069
07:02:08,350 --> 07:02:09,430
This is where we started.

8070
07:02:09,690 --> 07:02:11,190
No, this is where we started.

8071
07:02:11,330 --> 07:02:14,810
Things were great and then things started not being so great.

8072
07:02:18,990 --> 07:02:25,050
Guys, I'm sorry to tell you but Drake's a fucking... Kendrick Lamar is a fucking quitter.

8073
07:02:25,830 --> 07:02:27,290
I'm sorry, guys.

8074
07:02:30,430 --> 07:02:31,470
So positive.

8075
07:02:31,630 --> 07:02:33,850
Tomorrow won't be... Actually, I don't know.

8076
07:02:34,610 --> 07:02:36,850
Maybe I'll play a little bit off stream tomorrow.

8077
07:02:37,010 --> 07:02:37,490
I don't know.

8078
07:02:37,890 --> 07:02:39,890
Tomorrow I may or may not... Actually, no.

8079
07:02:39,970 --> 07:02:42,450
I'm not going to... I don't want you guys to camp on my chat.

8080
07:02:43,090 --> 07:02:47,810
Guys, I'm not going to let you guys camp in my chat so I'm just going to say tomorrow I'm not going to be streaming Marvel Rivals.

8081
07:02:49,090 --> 07:02:51,570
I'm going to rest my hand a little bit.

8082
07:02:51,630 --> 07:02:52,250
My left hand.

8083
07:02:52,330 --> 07:02:53,190
My right hand is okay.

8084
07:02:53,390 --> 07:02:54,330
Usually it's your right hand.

8085
07:02:58,030 --> 07:03:00,150
I'm going to rest my left hand for tomorrow.

8086
07:03:01,410 --> 07:03:02,430
GGs, everybody.

8087
07:03:02,610 --> 07:03:05,950
For those who are new here, my name is Doki Bird.

8088
07:03:06,210 --> 07:03:07,570
I usually stream on YouTube.

8089
07:03:08,390 --> 07:03:12,630
Right now, I have a very crippling addiction to Marvel Rivals.

8090
07:03:14,510 --> 07:03:17,770
That's why I'm here on Twitch at the moment.

8091
07:03:18,190 --> 07:03:20,730
So please follow me on YouTube if you subscribe to me.

8092
07:03:20,890 --> 07:03:21,830
That's great!

8093
07:03:22,230 --> 07:03:23,550
Marvel Rivals, devs!

8094
07:03:23,930 --> 07:03:26,190
For once in my life, I have more viewers than Necros.

8095
07:03:26,190 --> 07:03:27,530
Where's my...

8096
07:03:29,050 --> 07:03:29,550
Sorry.

8097
07:03:30,110 --> 07:03:36,390
All I'm saying is that I could also be a sponsor too.

8098
07:03:42,150 --> 07:03:43,310
Real though.

8099
07:03:43,990 --> 07:03:46,150
For once in my life.

8100
07:03:48,890 --> 07:03:50,290
You're already addicted.

8101
07:03:50,490 --> 07:03:52,710
You're literally playing the game for...

8102
07:03:52,710 --> 07:03:58,770
But all I'm saying is it would be great to sponsor me before...

8103
07:03:58,770 --> 07:04:02,770
If you sponsor me, I'll stay after season zero.

8104
07:04:09,390 --> 07:04:12,310
Anyway, I do want to get paid for my addiction.

8105
07:04:12,590 --> 07:04:14,310
Like, I'm literally doing this for free.

8106
07:04:15,390 --> 07:04:16,450
They already got me.

8107
07:04:16,870 --> 07:04:18,890
They already fucking got me.

8108
07:04:18,890 --> 07:04:20,670
Yeah, okay.

8109
07:04:20,950 --> 07:04:21,770
Alright, here's the deal.

8110
07:04:21,950 --> 07:04:23,990
But if you sponsor me, I'll buy skins.

8111
07:04:24,650 --> 07:04:26,590
I'll actually spend money.

8112
07:04:26,970 --> 07:04:30,230
I haven't spent a single dollar in Marvel Rivals yet.

8113
07:04:30,330 --> 07:04:31,370
I'm free to play, baby.

8114
07:04:31,830 --> 07:04:33,490
I'm literally a free to play warrior.

8115
07:04:33,730 --> 07:04:35,730
I haven't spent any fucking money.

8116
07:04:36,490 --> 07:04:38,050
I'm here to free to play.

8117
07:04:39,970 --> 07:04:42,790
I will shill your skins if you sponsor me.

8118
07:04:42,890 --> 07:04:44,370
Got a Marvel Rivals.

8119
07:04:44,370 --> 07:04:47,230
All I'm saying, you know where the money's at.

8120
07:04:47,390 --> 07:04:50,630
I would shill your skins so fucking hard.

8121
07:04:55,970 --> 07:04:57,010
Anyway, guys.

8122
07:04:57,410 --> 07:04:58,750
Thank you all for watching.

8123
07:04:59,330 --> 07:05:02,770
I hope you guys enjoyed watching me.

8124
07:05:04,090 --> 07:05:06,510
I swear, I'm variety.

8125
07:05:07,850 --> 07:05:11,610
Guys, please don't leave me because of Marvel Rivals.

8126
07:05:12,070 --> 07:05:12,670
Dragoons.

8127
07:05:12,870 --> 07:05:14,410
Dragoons, I swear to God.

8128
07:05:16,870 --> 07:05:17,830
Dragoons, please.

8129
07:05:17,970 --> 07:05:19,990
I'm not trying to kill my career right now.

8130
07:05:20,250 --> 07:05:22,710
Just six more days.

8131
07:05:23,790 --> 07:05:25,230
Six more days.

8132
07:05:27,730 --> 07:05:28,470
Anyway, guys.

8133
07:05:29,530 --> 07:05:31,150
Things I want to personally shill.

8134
07:05:32,190 --> 07:05:32,990
I do have several.

8135
07:05:33,110 --> 07:05:34,330
If you want to support me via other means.

8136
07:05:35,450 --> 07:05:36,210
Follow me on Twitter.

8137
07:05:36,370 --> 07:05:38,170
I usually tweet out when I'm going to go live on Twitch.

8138
07:05:38,550 --> 07:05:41,070
If you want to support me via other means, I have an Android.

8139
07:05:41,390 --> 07:05:43,830
I do have an Android that you can pre-order.

8140
07:05:44,810 --> 07:05:47,770
For those who are new here and want to see what an Android looks like.

8141
07:05:49,110 --> 07:05:49,850
Where's an Android?

8142
07:05:50,570 --> 07:05:51,010
Yay!

8143
07:05:51,930 --> 07:05:52,990
From Good Smile.

8144
07:05:53,510 --> 07:05:54,270
I have an Android.

8145
07:05:54,610 --> 07:05:55,570
Yes, that's me.

8146
07:05:55,710 --> 07:05:57,130
That's my older skinsuit.

8147
07:05:58,110 --> 07:06:04,090
And if we have enough orders for an Android, we might get an Android of this skinsuit.

8148
07:06:04,170 --> 07:06:05,550
Of the Bounty Hunter skinsuit.

8149
07:06:05,950 --> 07:06:09,690
Anyway, other than that, I also have other things to shill.

8150
07:06:10,110 --> 07:06:11,630
I have a custom PC case.

8151
07:06:11,730 --> 07:06:12,970
Apparently, it might get restocked.

8152
07:06:12,990 --> 07:06:13,930
I know it says sold out.

8153
07:06:14,270 --> 07:06:15,450
But apparently, I don't know.

8154
07:06:15,510 --> 07:06:16,790
Or my manager lied to me.

8155
07:06:16,790 --> 07:06:18,210
But I was like, is it sold out?

8156
07:06:18,230 --> 07:06:19,970
And they're like, no, they're planning on restocking it.

8157
07:06:20,190 --> 07:06:22,030
But I do have PC keycaps.

8158
07:06:22,670 --> 07:06:23,970
Custom PC cases.

8159
07:06:24,210 --> 07:06:25,070
Desk mat.

8160
07:06:25,470 --> 07:06:25,950
Charms.

8161
07:06:26,070 --> 07:06:26,510
Wall scroll.

8162
07:06:29,450 --> 07:06:30,350
What else?

8163
07:06:31,010 --> 07:06:34,890
My GamerStuff code is DokiBird for 10% off.

8164
07:06:34,970 --> 07:06:37,790
I actually drank GamerStuff literally before this stream.

8165
07:06:38,810 --> 07:06:41,290
That's why I'm alive right now.

8166
07:06:43,490 --> 07:06:44,310
What else?

8167
07:06:44,410 --> 07:06:45,230
I think that's really it.

8168
07:06:45,230 --> 07:06:47,530
Anyway, guys, thank you all for coming.

8169
07:06:47,690 --> 07:06:48,970
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

8170
07:06:49,170 --> 07:06:51,190
Pause your check-in up and around to get that blood flowing.

8171
07:06:51,550 --> 07:06:53,910
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

8172
07:06:54,090 --> 07:06:55,410
Cause you deserve it.

8173
07:06:55,490 --> 07:06:56,850
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

8174
07:06:57,050 --> 07:06:57,750
Bye, guys.

8175
07:06:58,130 --> 07:06:58,490
Bye!
