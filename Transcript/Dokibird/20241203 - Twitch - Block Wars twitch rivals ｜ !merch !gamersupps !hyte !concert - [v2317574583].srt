00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,390
Hello, hello!

2
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,430
I lost track of time because I was playing Minecraft Smash Bros.

3
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,630
You might be wondering, what the fuck does that mean, Doki?

4
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:03,170
Well, it's basically I climb up and it's smashing time.

5
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,130
That's basically it.

6
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,210
I was doing this.

7
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:13,410
I was literally doing this the last, like, ten minutes.

8
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,570
Doki, that's right.

9
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:18,590
Get the fuck out.

10
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,690
No, wait, not me, not me, not me, no!

11
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:23,470
Okay, yeah, but I was just smashing.

12
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,690
I was fighting a dev.

13
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:31,890
And I looked at it and I was like, I was like, oh shit, wait.

14
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,370
Wait, it's 2-0-1, oh fuck.

15
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,650
I was like, Doki smash.

16
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,490
That's fucking right.

17
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:43,630
Get out of here.

18
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,610
This is Doki smash hour.

19
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,170
I was like, wait a minute.

20
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,150
We have Smash Bros.

21
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,370
in Minecraft?

22
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,970
So, this is what I've been doing the entire time.

23
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,250
I was, like, waiting for it.

24
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,110
Because this never starts in time.

25
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,150
They never start on time.

26
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,770
Look it, we're missing three people.

27
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:05,710
They never start on time, so I'm like, what do I do?

28
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:11,770
I'm just gonna explore and I've realized, I realized there's, like, Smash Bros.

29
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,430
I was like, oh my god, I can actually smash.

30
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:14,710
No!

31
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:15,650
No!

32
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,390
I died.

33
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,230
I saw this, I was like, Sumo Arena?

34
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,930
The fuck is this?

35
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,790
Also, uh, Saucy Pizza, thank you for the gifted one sub.

36
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:33,670
Thank you, thank you.

37
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,870
Oh, I should get my cough drop, I'm so unprepared.

38
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,450
You can't stream this on YouTube?

39
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,250
No, it's Twitch Rivals this time.

40
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:48,490
So, like, usually on Twitch Rivals, since I got invited for Twitch Rivals.

41
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,830
I'm sorry, I'm playing Minecraft.

42
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,790
I reverted into a child.

43
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,190
I went on Twitch for this.

44
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,910
I'll get my cough drop real fast, I'll be right back.

45
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,520
Okay, I'm back.

46
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,380
So, um, so yeah, basically it's a Minecraft competition.

47
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,480
Again.

48
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,040
Guys, you know that one time I won the...

49
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:39,140
I won on my first time playing this, and now, like, I'm just chasing the high.

50
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,300
I'm always trying to chase the high.

51
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:51,720
I'm like a washed up child star, trying to chase that one moment in time in her life where she, like, she was a star.

52
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,180
That's why I always come back.

53
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,400
That's why when they're like, do you want to do it?

54
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:12,760
And I'm like, oh man, remember that one time I won Black Wars on my first try, and then now I'm going to proceed to lose to every single one of them.

55
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,160
And then I never... she's like, no!

56
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,460
Don't say that!

57
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:24,720
I personally feel like that Ryan kid in Ryan's world does not want to do this anymore.

58
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,880
Maddie, thank you for the gifted one sub!

59
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,220
Thank you!

60
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:35,100
So I'm always chasing that high of, like, oh my god, what if, like, oh my god, I hate this.

61
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,620
I hate the Trident area.

62
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,760
I'm just like, what if I could win again?

63
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,960
And then, like, every time I join...

64
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,060
Well, this is the third time I'm joining, but, like, maybe it'll be different, guys.

65
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,180
Guys, maybe it'll be different.

66
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,040
You don't know that.

67
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,300
Peaked in high...

68
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,220
Yeah, my first Black Wars is where I peaked, for sure.

69
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:04,580
I like how, like, the first Black Wars is where I knew the least of what the fuck is going on, and I win.

70
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:18,080
And then the other Black Wars proceeding, like, after that, like, I actually know what I'm doing, but then, like, okay, I like how I based my point of reference on that one Black Wars game I did right after, because technically this is my second Black Wars.

71
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:26,760
This is my second time, like, the third time playing Black Wars, but I can feel it.

72
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,100
I don't understand the trident.

73
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,640
Do I have to be in the water when I do this?

74
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,780
Or, like, I don't understand.

75
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,260
I'm too stupid.

76
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,580
I don't understand the trident at all.

77
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,860
You get close to the edge.

78
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,320
I don't use the trident, so, like, I get so confused.

79
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,680
Oh, fuck.

80
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,460
Okay, yeah.

81
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,160
I just get so confused.

82
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,660
I don't understand this.

83
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:06,200
Okay, by the way, the difficulty on this one is, like, the very first Black Wars, so we're gonna... Remember that parkour level?

84
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:16,760
Remember that parkour level that I struggled a lot with the very first time we played Black Wars?

85
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:17,740
Yeah!

86
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,100
It's gonna be like that.

87
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,080
I get it.

88
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,840
It's gonna...

89
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:32,080
And, like, you know, there was a trident area part of it, and, like, you know, it was not pretty.

90
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,600
It was... It's not a beginner lobby.

91
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,200
By the way, this lobby is actually pretty fucking intense.

92
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,660
Like, I was looking at it, and I was like, bro, what the fuck?

93
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,340
Almost everybody here is, like, a Minecraft player.

94
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,600
And I'm here.

95
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:46,940
And there's me.

96
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,780
Oh, hey, it's, like, sumo... Ah!

97
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:49,640
It's okay.

98
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,720
It wasn't gonna take me anywhere anyway.

99
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,520
That's the sumo area.

100
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,400
Okay.

101
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:56,920
Uh...

102
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,900
Okay, so, yeah, it's literally the same thing.

103
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,260
There's the order up.

104
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,000
There's party.

105
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,740
Like, literally, we played all of this before.

106
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,400
Yeah, but we're better now, guys.

107
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,360
We're... We're better now.

108
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,120
We know what to do this time.

109
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,640
This is different.

110
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,120
Okay.

111
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,400
Oh, wait, everybody... Oh, wait.

112
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,740
Okay, I'll join the VC now.

113
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,200
I'll be back.

114
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,180
I don't know if I have sound guy awake or sound team.

115
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,020
Oh, yeah.

116
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,220
Apparently, I have a team now.

117
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,740
I don't know if sound team is awake, though.

118
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,060
Let me join the VC real quick.

119
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,400
Hello.

120
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:31,620
Hello.

121
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,060
Hey, guys.

122
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,120
Are you guys...

123
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,280
Good morning.

124
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:36,680
What?

125
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,880
It's the fuck you guy.

126
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:38,960
Which one?

127
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,120
There's multiple?

128
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,600
You.

129
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:41,740
Wait, me?

130
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,440
Why am I the fuck you guy?

131
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,200
No, no.

132
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,700
You kind of made me think of the fuck you guy.

133
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,420
Wait, who's the fuck you guy?

134
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,380
Who is the fuck you guy?

135
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,860
Who's the fuck you guy?

136
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,700
Wait, who?

137
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,460
Wait, I'm so confused.

138
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,240
The boogeyman.

139
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,100
Who's the boogeyman?

140
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:06,460
Dookie.

141
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,100
Oh!

142
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:16,860
Sorry,

143
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,520
I'm a little slow.

144
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,260
Wait, I might be thinking the wrong thing because we were meant multiple people.

145
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:36,140
I might be thinking, Kumi, there's multiple fuck you guys, so I might...

146
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,040
There's multiple fuck you guys in...

147
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,700
Kumi, I think, like, you know...

148
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,660
You gotta be very specific because you've like...

149
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,380
There's multiple fuck you guys in your dictionary.

150
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,560
Is it the...

151
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,940
You know, the fuck?

152
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,220
The fuck you guy?

153
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,080
You're gonna make me throw up.

154
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,760
You're gonna make me throw up.

155
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:07,660
I feel sick.

156
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,920
Or the...

157
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,600
Fuck you guy?

158
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,120
What is wrong with you?

159
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,540
What is wrong with you?

160
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,080
You gotta be specific!

161
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,740
There's multiple!

162
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,860
It's the...

163
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,700
Fuck you guy.

164
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,560
Okay, but like...

165
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,640
Wait, no, you gotta...

166
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,580
Is it the...

167
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,680
Fuck, fuck you guy?

168
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,040
Or the fuck, fuck you guy?

169
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,660
Oh, it's the...

170
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,980
Fuck, fuck you guy.

171
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,460
Oh, okay, I know who it is.

172
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,300
I was just thinking.

173
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,340
Oh, okay.

174
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,760
Then I don't know then.

175
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,340
No, I'm pretty sure you know who it is.

176
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,600
If you're saying you know who it is, then I think you know it.

177
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,680
Yeah, but there's...

178
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,420
But there's multiple here.

179
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,320
There's at least like...

180
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,800
There's at least like...

181
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,700
I think there's like seven.

182
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,220
Yeah, yeah, I was gonna say that.

183
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,800
Gumi, I think like...

184
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,640
I think like...

185
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,320
One of them is on our team.

186
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,620
Yeah, chill.

187
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,640
And he's seven right now.

188
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,640
Fuck you guy number one.

189
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,980
Guys, look, we have ugly sweat.

190
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:27,920
Is this an ugly sweater?

191
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,080
I'm worried it's not supposed to be an ugly sweater.

192
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:31,860
And then I called it ugly.

193
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,100
I'm sorry.

194
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,900
It is a very pretty sweater.

195
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,480
Christmas sweater team.

196
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:39,800
Right?

197
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,080
Oh no, we're like wearing winter clothes.

198
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,880
We're like little elves.

199
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,520
Wait, I have a ponytail.

200
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,680
I have like a mistletoe.

201
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,880
On my head.

202
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,120
I have a ponytail.

203
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,620
Look, there's a mistletoe, Doki.

204
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,860
Wait, where is it?

205
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,440
It's not a mistletoe.

206
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,960
It's on the back of my head.

207
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,280
It's not a mistletoe.

208
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,080
It's a hat.

209
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,260
Anyways, it's a fucking hat.

210
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,100
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

211
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,860
I don't want to become a fuck you guy.

212
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,840
I'm scared.

213
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,380
I don't want to become a fuck you guy.

214
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,460
I'm scared.

215
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,300
Oh my god, who are we waiting for?

216
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,420
We were all here.

217
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,120
Let's start the game.

218
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,580
Who are you interviewing?

219
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:36,600
Who is it?

220
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,720
Why is it not us?

221
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:38,520
Or me?

222
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,260
What the fuck?

223
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,700
I think you are the fuck you guy.

224
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,280
All I'm saying...

225
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,780
Is that anybody should be interviewed.

226
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,060
I don't have an ego or anything.

227
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,620
I'm just...

228
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,380
Yeah, I mean, you have a 100% win rate, right?

229
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,480
No.

230
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,480
It wasn't my fault.

231
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,760
Let's just say...

232
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,560
I actually did pretty well.

233
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,480
Individual wise.

234
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,000
What place did you get out of...

235
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,420
Like...

236
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,180
20th?

237
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,840
Yeah, I'm like...

238
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,220
Average.

239
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,620
I'm just average in Minecraft.

240
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,720
Which is pretty good.

241
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,360
But it was like...

242
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,900
My second time playing.

243
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,460
I'm gonna watch you doing parkour.

244
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,740
Please don't.

245
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,060
Parkour is actually...

246
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,840
The only thing I can't do.

247
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,980
What are we waiting for?

248
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,600
I feel like you asked that two minutes ago.

249
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,860
And it's still the same thing.

250
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,700
The interviews.

251
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,080
Yeah, but like...

252
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,840
Who...

253
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,580
I'm gonna call them out.

254
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,440
On live, on stream.

255
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,160
Oh wait, I shouldn't.

256
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:03,640
That's our teammate.

257
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,260
Why did they pick her and not me?

258
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,360
No, I'm joking.

259
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,960
All I'm saying is that...

260
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,420
If they went up to me...

261
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,740
And was like, I wanna interview you.

262
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,840
I'll be like, if you wanna interview me...

263
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,620
You gotta interview the whole team.

264
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,740
I can totally imagine you saying that.

265
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

266
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,260
I'll be like...

267
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,460
I feel like...

268
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,980
This is a team effort.

269
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,980
And because it's a team effort...

270
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,060
I want my entire team to be here...

271
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:43,660
For the interview.

272
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,320
That's all I'm saying.

273
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,120
Don't tell our teammate I said that.

274
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:58,000
I think I've been reporting something to my teammate...

275
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,720
That you've said that.

276
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,400
No you won't.

277
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,660
No you won't.

278
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,460
I can...

279
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,540
I can...

280
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,420
Blackmail...

281
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,680
I can...

282
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,320
I can extort you.

283
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,100
Yeah, you do.

284
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,680
You see that ticket over there?

285
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,400
It would be a shame if I...

286
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,680
I don't even drive, Doki.

287
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,600
No, you see that...

288
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,300
VIP ticket over there?

289
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,880
It would be a shame if I just...

290
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,040
Changed the name.

291
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,940
It would be a shame if I just...

292
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,240
Changed the name on the ticket.

293
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,780
Oh my god, she is the fuck you guy.

294
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,180
She is the fuck you guy.

295
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,920
You're just like the other fuck you guys.

296
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:52,940
For those who are wondering...

297
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,800
For those who are like...

298
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,320
What the fuck are they talking about?

299
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,800
So like, you guys know that there's...

300
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,780
The Streamy Awards.

301
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,460
So like, apparently everybody...

302
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,240
That got nominated...

303
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,200
Gets to go to the thing...

304
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,420
Because you have to be there.

305
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,240
But like...

306
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,180
I like how Gumi was like...

307
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,400
Oh yeah, really?

308
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,200
What is that?

309
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,540
Even though she's like part of it.

310
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,560
Basically,

311
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,500
Gumi was like...

312
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,340
Oh my god, can I like...

313
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,380
Can I like hold the tablet?

314
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,600
So like, because I can't go.

315
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,040
So I was like, yeah, sure.

316
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,220
So basically, Gumi is going in...

317
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,080
In my place.

318
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,720
But she's holding a tablet of me.

319
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,540
And I'll also be streaming...

320
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,680
Silent Hill 2 on that day.

321
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,160
So you just message me.

322
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,360
And in the middle of my stream, I can call in.

323
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,140
We'll be at the red carpet.

324
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,920
In the middle of my own Silent Hill 2 stream.

325
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,180
We'll be in the red carpet.

326
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,300
And I'll just be like, hey guys.

327
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,800
I'll be like, intermission.

328
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,820
Intermission right now.

329
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,900
So we're going to have to be at the red carpet.

330
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,500
Hold on, chat.

331
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,200
I gotta be on camera for like 5 seconds, guys.

332
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,760
So we're going to be doing it live.

333
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,700
But yeah, Gumi...

334
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,840
I asked if Gumi could go in my place.

335
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,720
And they said yeah, as long as they like...

336
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,000
Hold my tablet of me.

337
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,860
Because the camera's going to pan to her.

338
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,160
When they like...

339
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,640
Say the nominations.

340
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,560
And also...

341
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,060
When she goes to the red carpet.

342
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,160
They'll be like, who are you?

343
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,900
And she has to say Doki Bird.

344
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,740
Because it's literally in my name.

345
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,100
Wait, I can't say Doki Bird's butler or something?

346
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,540
I mean, you can.

347
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,600
You can if you want.

348
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,580
Just say whatever the fuck you want.

349
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,960
But you gotta make sure that they know you're going for me.

350
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,960
Dude, I'm going to have to download a GIF.

351
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,840
And have it playing on repeat on an iPad.

352
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,940
And say, oh yeah, this is her.

353
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,040
I can literally call in.

354
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,060
I can literally scream.

355
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,660
Not the entire time.

356
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,760
You're going to be playing Silent Hill.

357
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,220
No, I'm stopping in the middle of Silent Hill.

358
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,680
I'm going to be stopping in the middle of Silent Hill.

359
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,620
And call in and be like...

360
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,980
And then like, you know, QT would be like...

361
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,900
Hey guys, like, who's this?

362
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,440
And I'll be like, hey QT.

363
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,940
I'm just passing in the middle of my Silent Hill game.

364
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,880
Just to be here.

365
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,480
You know?

366
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,220
Do you have a script?

367
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,040
Do you have like a script written out already?

368
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,220
Each of you will.

369
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,340
Like on the red carpet.

370
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,480
Like they're interviewing you on the iPad.

371
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,000
Yeah, yeah.

372
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:48,960
Hello.

373
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:50,800
Hello Hannah.

374
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,380
Hello, hello.

375
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,780
But yeah chat, this is what I meant when like...

376
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,820
I can literally revoke...

377
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,840
I can change the name of the ticket so she can't even get in.

378
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,320
Dude.

379
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,640
Actually they changed that.

380
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,860
You're not allowed to mess with the form anymore.

381
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,800
Because do you know why?

382
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,320
Last year people were messing around too much.

383
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,820
And kept swapping names and stuff.

384
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:14,520
Oh.

385
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,440
Yeah, but I'm new.

386
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,520
So then they'll just be like, oh maybe she made a mistake.

387
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,000
If I do it once.

388
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:23,740
Evil, evil.

389
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,420
Gumi, are you on Lunar right now?

390
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,020
No man, I don't even...

391
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,600
Shayna's doing something crazy right now.

392
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,260
That's all I'll say.

393
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:34,480
Lunar?

394
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,600
The fuck is that?

395
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,900
It's a Minecraft client where they get to emote.

396
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,120
And I think Ampross is actually the fuck you guy doki.

397
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,900
There's so many.

398
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,700
No, no, no.

399
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,520
But not like the fuck.

400
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,320
Like fuck you guy, but like...

401
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,260
Oh, fuck.

402
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,460
Fuck you guy.

403
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:52,300
Oh.

404
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,500
Oh.

405
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,940
And I'm watching him fuck you guy another fuck you guy.

406
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,220
Oh, wait.

407
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,260
BL?

408
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:00,820
Yeah.

409
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,720
Wait, where, where, where?

410
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,380
In the middle of spawn.

411
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,040
Oh, okay.

412
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,580
I'm coming over.

413
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,400
I can't miss that out.

414
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,120
I see it.

415
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,100
No he's not.

416
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,120
It's because we can't see it doki.

417
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,340
They have a special client.

418
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,760
We don't have the glasses.

419
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,780
We have a special fuck you guy client.

420
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:22,720
Damn.

421
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,100
He's twerking.

422
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,320
Oh, no, no, I see it.

423
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,320
Now I see it.

424
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:27,820
I see it now.

425
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,300
Dude, I think you're lying to me.

426
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,080
No, no, I see it.

427
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:31,960
I see it.

428
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,980
Yeah, yeah, no, I see it.

429
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,340
I have it specifically downloaded just for this moment.

430
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,400
Oh, okay.

431
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,260
Man, I love Minecraft.

432
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,860
What are we waiting for now?

433
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:51,840
I don't know.

434
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,060
My tab is a little bit broken.

435
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,420
I think everybody's on.

436
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,360
Start the game.

437
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,080
Start the game.

438
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,540
I don't think it's going to matter.

439
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,760
I think they updated the map a lot.

440
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,380
I don't know how much it actually matters.

441
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,480
I'll watch it right now.

442
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:06,920
Fine.

443
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,320
There's no way.

444
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,900
They would never update the map.

445
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,320
They'll keep it the same forever.

446
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,520
You would wish that.

447
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,060
I don't want to learn a new map.

448
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,760
You just follow people.

449
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,980
That's all you need to do.

450
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,340
No, that's too hard.

451
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,120
You just look at the shoes and follow them.

452
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,200
That requires me to use my eyes.

453
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,500
What else are you doing?

454
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:33,860
Instinct.

455
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,080
Pure instinct.

456
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:41,160
Is your bubble icon thing working okay?

457
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,100
Yeah.

458
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,020
Bubble icon?

459
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,260
The discord bubble...

460
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:45,960
I don't know.

461
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,700
I'm using my own.

462
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,340
My own link.

463
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,000
Yeah, I think they use bubbles instead of boogies.

464
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,660
What the fuck is a bubble?

465
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,540
No, I don't use boogie.

466
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,700
I use discord.

467
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,340
I don't use... yeah.

468
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:03,400
Hello.

469
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,880
Hello.

470
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:08,940
Testing.

471
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,880
One, two, three.

472
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,620
Guys, I'm getting antsy.

473
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,260
And when I get antsy, I'm gonna turn into a fuck you guy.

474
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,920
Okay, but what would you do as a fuck you guy?

475
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,940
Oh, I would say fuck you.

476
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,760
So that's just regular you.

477
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:23,940
What?

478
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,720
That's just regular you.

479
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,340
What's the difference?

480
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,820
I barely curse, man.

481
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,140
Oh my.

482
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,400
Okay, let's see.

483
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,040
We're starting.

484
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:34,760
That's the ready.

485
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,520
I actually don't know how it's tabbed out, but yeah, we're starting.

486
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,840
It's tabbed out, but like I think so.

487
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:55,300
I'm just adjusting my sound right now.

488
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:56,680
Oh.

489
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,400
Fuck you guy.

490
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,760
Alright, Ant, I'm watching the video.

491
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:01,700
Okay.

492
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,700
What are we watching videos of?

493
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,520
You should, like, screen share it for me.

494
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,660
Oh, race?

495
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,520
Okay, I'll screen share it for you.

496
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,040
There's a race.

497
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,780
Honestly, we should play this game first if we can.

498
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:15,700
I don't know if it'll happen.

499
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:16,860
We should play this game first.

500
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:22,200
I don't think it's gonna be first because they always vote order up, though.

501
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:23,420
Yeah.

502
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,460
We could do this or temple first.

503
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,000
I'll burn.

504
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:31,040
Whoever gets the fireball, burn the order up area.

505
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:40,320
Wait, for the order up, are you and Hanna going to be in charge of crafting ant frost?

506
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,620
I'm okay with whatever.

507
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,060
Yeah.

508
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,320
We're good at simple tasks.

509
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,980
I'm a very simple girl.

510
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,140
Yeah, that's fine.

511
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:57,100
Somebody's gotta be on, like, mushroom duty and getting a lot of mushrooms so that we can get the upgrades.

512
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,280
Alright, SK, that's your job.

513
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:00,900
I like mushrooms.

514
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,600
Oh, I forgot about that!

515
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,820
You start off with it and do the Feinberg strat and you start off getting all the mushrooms.

516
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:07,520
Okay.

517
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,220
Then if I do that, then SK should just grab a ton of apples instead.

518
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,320
Apples.

519
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,040
Because we need a lot of apples as well.

520
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,820
SK, you've played blockways before, right, Miss SK?

521
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:19,800
Nope.

522
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,340
Oh, no, but she...

523
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:25,240
You just need to hit the tree leaves in the apple area.

524
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,960
There'll be a little apple icon on the map that you'll see when you look around.

525
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,100
You see trees?

526
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,800
You just hit the tree.

527
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,300
I will smack the tree.

528
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,220
It's like Minecraft.

529
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,540
Yeah, I saw you play Minecraft Civilization.

530
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,440
I know you got this.

531
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,940
Parkour Civilization!

532
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:40,900
Yeah!

533
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,840
I'm a parkour master.

534
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,040
Not to flex or anything.

535
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,440
Wait, did you finish it?

536
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,820
No, I didn't.

537
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,100
I got pretty close though.

538
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,100
Wait, why did you stop?

539
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,240
The server was lagging and then I had to play Street Fighter.

540
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,820
I need to go back though.

541
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,060
Yeah, you're just gonna give up like that, SK?

542
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,260
I need to realize my dreams.

543
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,660
You're right, I'll never be a parkour champion if I just give up that easily.

544
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,520
Yeah, exactly.

545
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,920
What would he say?

546
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,360
What would the guy in that video would say if he sees you like this?

547
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,060
He would say I'm weak.

548
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,660
I can't have this.

549
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,500
You might as well just leave Block Horse right now and boot up Parkour Civilization.

550
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,040
Wait, Ant, were you watching my screen?

551
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:28,740
Yeah.

552
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:29,800
Okay.

553
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,140
Guys, I might go do that.

554
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:38,380
I know this is gonna change a lot of the map though, so I'm not sure how much of the map will still be the same.

555
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:39,760
Yeah.

556
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,260
I don't really know how to play it.

557
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,320
Okay, so when we get into Tomb Titans, what is your plan for us?

558
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,620
We need to find the portal.

559
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:54,480
Yeah, I think just like staying semi-together is a lot better than splitting up for the most part.

560
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,260
Because the mobs are sort of scary.

561
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,600
It's very easy to die to the mobs.

562
00:25:59,540 --> 00:25:59,940
Really?

563
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:03,720
I thought the mobs weren't that bad.

564
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,000
I think we split up with teams of two.

565
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,920
It depends on where you are.

566
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,760
Sometimes the mobs will get you cornered and then you just can't get away.

567
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,620
There's a lot of skeletons more than anything.

568
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:18,420
Yeah, because when I was with Finebrae, we split up and I think we did really well in that part.

569
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:22,480
I think splitting up is fine as long as somebody can get to you if you happen to die.

570
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,380
I'm so scared for that game.

571
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,800
I'm fine with Tomb Titans.

572
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,600
I've played that game once.

573
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,020
I have no idea what I'm doing, to be honest.

574
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,320
I know nothing, so I hear nothing.

575
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,240
Oh, the tomb thing is darker and darker.

576
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:38,980
That's basically it.

577
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:42,700
Yeah, it's literally dark and darker, but like Minecraft.

578
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,580
Wait, you've never played dark and darker?

579
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,940
No, I really should.

580
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,260
I've played Tarkov.

581
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,260
Is that the same?

582
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,660
Yeah, it's kind of similar.

583
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:58,880
Basically, you pick up a lot of pots and items and stuff on the floor killing mobs and if you want to avoid other players and dying.

584
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:02,540
Well, no, other players can't kill you unless you're in the big zone, right?

585
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,020
I saw something about vases.

586
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,020
Breaking vases.

587
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:07,740
Yeah.

588
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,420
Is there a boss area that you can die in?

589
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,940
Yeah, it's just the boss area.

590
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,340
Dude, what if she wanders in there?

591
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:15,840
I'm just gonna die.

592
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,040
There's a giant fucking troll in the middle, she'll know.

593
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,000
Dude, there's a giant fuck you guy in the middle is what Doki said.

594
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,180
Hey, everybody's a fuck you guy.

595
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,740
It's lost its meaning now, Gumi.

596
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,020
It's lost its meaning.

597
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,580
Do you know what the worst part is?

598
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,480
I was referencing a TikTok when I said fuck you guy, but you just rolled with it.

599
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,560
So now everyone is a fuck you guy.

600
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,480
Wait, this is the place from Squid Game.

601
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:41,840
What?

602
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,040
Yes.

603
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,780
Oh, these are the new players.

604
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,240
Yeah, mine are too.

605
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,080
Eski, that's you!

606
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:53,880
Eski!

607
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,340
That's you!

608
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,720
Is that it?

609
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,260
Oh, there's two new players.

610
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,240
Oh, that...

611
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,940
Oh no, there's only two new players.

612
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,280
You know what that means.

613
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,080
What should we do?

614
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,520
Nothing.

615
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,700
Oh, they also have the gingerbread man.

616
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,120
Oh, and then there's Shadow.

617
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:21,660
And then Shadow.

618
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,620
It's a Wall-E bear.

619
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,320
Wait, what should we do?

620
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,400
Of course.

621
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,560
Shadow.

622
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,860
Oh, elves.

623
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,260
I think I'm throwing it back on the ladies.

624
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,940
Where are we next?

625
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,840
Oh, we are!

626
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,380
Yo, check it out, guys.

627
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,100
Wait, are they...

628
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,560
Wait, Metal Sonic is there.

629
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,600
Metal Sonic?

630
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,380
Yeah!

631
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:01,360
Oh, I like how she was on the same skin as last blockers.

632
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,720
That's funny.

633
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,460
Oh, it's so cute.

634
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,740
And now to the donut.

635
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,340
Oh, that's like the picking.

636
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,280
We're gonna pick.

637
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,720
Okay, what do we want?

638
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:17,560
Race?

639
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,660
This is so cool.

640
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,420
Or tomb, yeah.

641
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,140
I feel like we want race.

642
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,060
I think we want race too.

643
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,880
You're really good, but I'm kind of...

644
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,680
We're not a movement team.

645
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,300
I just exist.

646
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,700
Battle, order up.

647
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,420
Everyone's already going to order up.

648
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:45,960
Our best games by far are battle and blitz hunt.

649
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,940
Guys, I don't think race is gonna win, guys.

650
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,600
Guys, we're moving to order up.

651
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,860
No, no, no.

652
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,700
Don't grieve, don't grieve.

653
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:00,540
Guys, I don't think people are gonna vote for race.

654
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,720
I have a cat voting for it.

655
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,440
Don't worry, plus one cat.

656
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,680
Wait, I'll get all the cats.

657
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,260
Plus one cat.

658
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,560
No, cat, no.

659
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,240
Come back.

660
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,700
Come here, cats.

661
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,820
Wait, how do you die in the voting stage?

662
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,100
You get hit.

663
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,700
Wait, wait, wait.

664
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,780
We might be able to do this, guys.

665
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,140
No, come back.

666
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,800
No, my god, Kabuto, stop.

667
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,560
My cat, no.

668
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,100
They picked me up.

669
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,140
Okay, it's fine.

670
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,160
I'm okay now.

671
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,000
I think it might be order up.

672
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,620
It's always order up.

673
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,640
It's always order up.

674
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,620
They don't like change.

675
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,500
Change is bad.

676
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,680
Is anyone going to be on delivery?

677
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,180
Ant, what's up with that?

678
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:50,500
I mean, I can do delivery if you want, Hannah.

679
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,240
We can craft together.

680
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,400
I can just do delivery as well.

681
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:52,940
Is that efficient?

682
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,540
That's what Feinberg made us do.

683
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:02,160
I think having one of the cooking people also deliver is good, I think.

684
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:03,120
Yeah.

685
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,940
Oh, Gumi, what did Feinberg say for you?

686
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:12,260
For us, just three of us were gathering, and then him and the other fellow was crafting and delivering.

687
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,440
The other fellow.

688
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,860
Don't even remember his name.

689
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:18,640
I only remember you and Feinberg.

690
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,940
Okay, then why don't me and Ant just craft and deliver, then?

691
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:22,440
Yeah.

692
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,000
I think eventually, once we get enough resources, maybe Gumi can move into the kitchen as well to help crafting.

693
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,140
We will get overwhelmed eventually.

694
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,700
We'll need to do more delivery than anything.

695
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,000
Okay, so who's going to get what right off the bat?

696
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,840
I get cows.

697
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,000
I'm the farmer.

698
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,380
I'll go get fish.

699
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,720
I'll get fish and plants.

700
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,980
Oh my god, milk time.

701
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,860
I can get some of these plants and...

702
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,320
Crops, maybe?

703
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,140
I'll get mushrooms.

704
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:47,340
Um...

705
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,180
And whoever's getting the cows, get all the animals too.

706
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,620
Gumi, can you get the sugar cane and the fish if you're going to be by the river?

707
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,460
I'm 90% sure sugar cane is by the river somewhere.

708
00:31:59,240 --> 00:31:59,860
Yeah, yeah.

709
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,780
No, I've seen it.

710
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,080
We should get the furnaces first-hand because it's lava buckets in them now.

711
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,820
You don't need coal anymore.

712
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,080
Oh, okay.

713
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,640
So we should upgrade that first.

714
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,920
You should upgrade everything.

715
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,380
So get all the mushrooms.

716
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,100
And then...

717
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,700
Does someone get mushrooms again?

718
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,620
How does that work?

719
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:23,960
At a certain point, I could just go back and get more if we need some or I can ask for somebody to get some.

720
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,620
And remember he didn't put all of them and he split them a little bit.

721
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:27,480
Yeah.

722
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:32,920
When we see that it's going to open up again, like the composter will open again, we can just have... we can get mushrooms real quick, I think.

723
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,600
Hey guys, where do I go for the apples?

724
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,460
Oh, you go straight.

725
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,780
You see the trees in front?

726
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,080
You look up.

727
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,200
You hit the tree.

728
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,380
SK, you see that?

729
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,260
That's a tree right there.

730
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,040
Oh, there's a big apple above it.

731
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:47,700
Yeah.

732
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,120
If you break the leaves, it'll just give you apples.

733
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:55,160
I know it's your first time seeing a tree, but that's what it looks like.

734
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,320
Wait, let's take a look at what is first to be made.

735
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:01,320
How about I do...

736
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,120
I don't know.

737
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,420
We need a lot of pork chops and we're just going to bake a lot of things.

738
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:10,620
Yeah, so once you kill all the animals, come back, just put them in the chest and then go kill some more.

739
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,340
I think focusing pigs would be good.

740
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,300
Okay, pigs?

741
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,140
Alright, no problem.

742
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,320
I'll make sure no more pigs are alive.

743
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,980
Should we bring a small batch back first?

744
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,920
I would just get a lot.

745
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,140
I'm heading over.

746
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,520
Five seconds, guys!

747
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,680
Once you get like 20 apples, maybe come back and then you can go back out for some more.

748
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,780
Maybe when you come back, you can make the golden apples and then put them in that chest.

749
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,600
Oh!

750
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,640
There's free gold on our farm.

751
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,220
Get down.

752
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,640
Don't worry, guys.

753
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,420
Where are these boxes?

754
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,540
I feel like I'm missing something.

755
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,640
Oh, these pumpkins.

756
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,000
I'm a troll.

757
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,020
I have acquired apples.

758
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,220
I'm bringing oranges back.

759
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,660
I'm going to come back when the composter is active, okay, Hannah?

760
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:57,600
Okay.

761
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,980
I don't really know what else to get.

762
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,400
Don't worry!

763
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,940
I've got some meat!

764
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:08,640
Whoever has meat, if you want to come back now and just put it in the furnace, go for it.

765
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:11,760
Did you get sugar?

766
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,880
Yeah, I'm bringing it back right now.

767
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,060
I put meat in the furnace.

768
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:17,480
Perfect.

769
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,960
I'm going to come back in a second, Hannah.

770
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,700
I'm going to get some more furnaces and we'll start going.

771
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,740
I'm dropping off everything in the chest.

772
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:25,240
Okay, I'm coming back now.

773
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:27,880
Goodbye, animals.

774
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,020
Yum, yum, yum.

775
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,280
Rush order.

776
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:33,780
Rush order.

777
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,700
We have rush order.

778
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,180
Oh my god.

779
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,160
Sorry.

780
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,800
That was me adding to the composter.

781
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:42,320
Don't worry.

782
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,280
I got a lot of levels.

783
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,980
What's the rush order?

784
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,300
20 apples.

785
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:51,820
I've got more meat.

786
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,260
Okay, so I have a stack.

787
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,560
I got some more cold apples.

788
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,780
Meat time, meat time.

789
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,240
Pork chops are done.

790
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,500
Is there any other specific stuff you need?

791
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,300
I'm grabbing fish.

792
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,720
We need baked potatoes as well.

793
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,980
You can bake the potatoes.

794
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,340
Potatoes going right now.

795
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,060
I don't know.

796
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:18,680
Someone get a lot of pumpkins.

797
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:19,840
I have five pumpkins.

798
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:23,100
Can I start putting raw meat in?

799
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,620
Can you sugar?

800
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,280
I got it.

801
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,160
I need more eggs.

802
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,640
If anyone can come back with eggs.

803
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,820
Sorry, I fell off the ladder.

804
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:36,920
I tripped and fell.

805
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,740
I'll go get eggs.

806
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:40,580
Okay.

807
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,300
How am I supposed to get up to this person?

808
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,240
Don't worry.

809
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,340
Here I go.

810
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,180
I have many things.

811
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,980
Oh my god, sorry.

812
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:50,780
You're fine.

813
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,880
I can go faster than you, so it's fine.

814
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:54,160
Okay.

815
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,400
There's 10 eggs in the chest now.

816
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,860
That didn't launch me.

817
00:35:59,340 --> 00:35:59,780
Okay.

818
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,240
Why did that not launch me?

819
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,460
Hey, this is my job.

820
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,500
Are you taking my job?

821
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,520
Why are you taking my job?

822
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,200
We didn't miss it.

823
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,380
I was just very bad at my job.

824
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,840
I'm getting crabs.

825
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,160
What do we need, squad?

826
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,040
Can I grab mushrooms?

827
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,320
I'm grabbing them.

828
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,380
Do you have the baked potatoes?

829
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,280
Oh my god.

830
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,060
Okay, can you put the baked potatoes in 2 and 3?

831
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:40,300
And?

832
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,760
I got 5 potatoes.

833
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,020
I'm coming over.

834
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,200
Maybe get another smoker, Hannah, from one of the upgrades.

835
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,280
Oh my god.

836
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:52,900
This is fun.

837
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,420
I feel alright.

838
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:00,140
I think if somebody wants to get a bunch of mushrooms for the next upgrade, that would be good.

839
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,200
Don't worry, I got you.

840
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,540
I'm going to take your job too, SK.

841
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,060
Okay, okay.

842
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,880
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

843
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,520
I'm going to deliver this, Hannah.

844
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:12,880
Oh my god.

845
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,540
For the cakes, we need a lot of eggs.

846
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,940
Alright, go do the eggs.

847
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,540
I got mushrooms.

848
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,300
I'm bringing back 2 stacks of mushrooms.

849
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:29,720
Hannah, whoever got the mushrooms, can you put them in the composter?

850
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,840
They're in the back.

851
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,340
There's still a bunch of oranges in the chest.

852
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,700
It'll be active in a minute.

853
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,160
Do the same one.

854
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,040
It is active.

855
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,360
Hannah, do the rush order.

856
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,780
I'm working on it.

857
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,640
I get apples.

858
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:52,200
Okay, I'm bringing back some more eggs before I come back.

859
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:55,740
I'm getting lemons.

860
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,340
I'm making the cakes.

861
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,140
I love being a farmer.

862
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,120
It's so chill.

863
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,720
I know, right?

864
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,840
I'm stressful over there.

865
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:11,040
I'm just a humble farmer.

866
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,740
Hannah, you got that.

867
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,480
I'll get it in a second.

868
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,160
I love farming.

869
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,000
Where's this customer?

870
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,880
I don't have enough wheat.

871
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,160
I don't have enough wheat to make this.

872
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:24,920
Oh, we need wheat.

873
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:27,740
It's trolled.

874
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,780
The rush order is trolled.

875
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,220
I'm getting cows.

876
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,440
It's okay, we don't need those rush orders.

877
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,740
Yeah, we don't need them.

878
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,820
I think we might have needed it.

879
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,060
I'm looking at our placement.

880
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,020
I brought some more wheat back.

881
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:49,960
I'd like to get more.

882
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,920
I got some more upgrades.

883
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:53,960
Do we have any deliveries?

884
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:54,300
No.

885
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,200
I got the apples.

886
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,940
Do we have pork chops going right now?

887
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,640
We have a lot of chicken.

888
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,840
I got pork chops.

889
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:13,900
Is there anything we really need right now?

890
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,440
Can you deliver that?

891
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,600
I got more fish.

892
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,100
Should we buy another elytra?

893
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,760
If we get more upgrades, we can.

894
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,260
I don't know how many points it is though.

895
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,760
Why is...

896
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,100
Here's some more fish.

897
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:32,860
Guys, you're asking what team are we and you don't see my name.

898
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,040
We're not even on the leader.

899
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,800
Okay, you go get the wheat, Goomy.

900
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,480
I'm getting mushrooms for this.

901
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,000
Rush order is definitely the most important thing to focus on when we can.

902
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,260
I go get...

903
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,280
Can you deliver the rush order?

904
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,880
I get more fruit.

905
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,220
Do you guys need more pumpkin?

906
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,240
Probably.

907
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,160
I go get a pump.

908
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,580
Jesus Christ, who's in Phantom?

909
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:23,560
Wait, Goomy, can you put some stuff to cook in the cooking things if possible?

910
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:27,460
I don't even know what I'm trying to do.

911
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,880
I'm going to make the mushroom soups.

912
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,320
This is like Minecraft aim trading.

913
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:36,760
Porkchop and chicken?

914
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,380
Do we have porkchop and chicken right now?

915
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,480
Yeah, in the chest.

916
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,600
This one's done too.

917
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,780
We have a lot of resources for something.

918
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,500
Just put it in the composter.

919
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,540
I'm supposed to put mushrooms in there, right?

920
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,200
Yeah, mushrooms is good to put in there.

921
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,520
I'm going back with some...

922
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,680
Whoa, some veggies.

923
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,260
Hannah, buy Elytra.

924
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,480
Potato and pumpkin pie.

925
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,340
I can do pumpkin pie real quick.

926
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:12,340
Hold up.

927
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,740
I need wheat.

928
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:17,040
Yeah, I just put some in there.

929
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,160
Pumpkin pie.

930
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,140
We need five big potatoes.

931
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,160
Oh my god, I'm so lost.

932
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,660
Do we have big potatoes?

933
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,940
I got more meat.

934
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,640
I thought we had a lot.

935
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,780
What, two minutes?

936
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,040
We have a minute left.

937
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,740
It's okay, I got some more wheat.

938
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,120
I'll make the golden apples.

939
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:44,240
I'll make it.

940
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,140
I mean...

941
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,060
Hannah, do you want to deliver that one?

942
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:48,620
Yeah.

943
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,240
Do we have lemons?

944
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,100
I put the lemons in.

945
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,400
I can do six lemons in here.

946
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:56,940
What do we need?

947
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:57,740
We need mutton.

948
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,820
I put it in already.

949
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:00,900
I'm going to deliver.

950
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,960
Oh, new restaurant.

951
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,060
I'll do the mushroom stews.

952
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,740
Can anyone work on the other thing?

953
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,860
I think right now meat is our main priority.

954
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,540
Can you get more wheat?

955
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,200
Yeah, I can get it.

956
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,860
I'm jumping over.

957
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,940
Where are the oranges?

958
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,080
I'm grabbing wheat now.

959
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,380
I grabbed all the wheat.

960
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,260
I'm here.

961
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:35,700
We have a minute left.

962
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,460
I'm doing deliveries now, by the way.

963
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:40,620
I think we have a lot of resources.

964
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,340
Can I just put wheat down?

965
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,240
We have 21.

966
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,800
I think we need to focus on orders now.

967
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,640
We have so many.

968
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,240
I got it.

969
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,400
If you want to help with the orders, you can.

970
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,820
We have a lot of resources right now.

971
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:57,840
What do we need?

972
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,500
Order 2 can be delivered, right?

973
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,480
Oh my god.

974
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,400
One mutton in there.

975
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:07,180
I did it.

976
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:11,660
I look and I'm a little confused.

977
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:13,240
Anyone need me to deliver something?

978
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,460
I'll make the golden carrots.

979
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,640
I'll make bread.

980
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,460
I'm confused.

981
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,700
Me too.

982
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,240
What did she give me to deliver?

983
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,760
You can deliver.

984
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:39,000
You can deliver it now.

985
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:39,400
Nice.

986
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,440
I don't think we can add anything else in.

987
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,700
That was rough.

988
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:44,920
The numbers mean.

989
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,360
You almost had first place.

990
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,320
We're 7th.

991
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:52,540
That was hard.

992
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:55,620
But 4th place has 25 and we have 24.

993
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:56,420
I know.

994
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,460
We just didn't get the rush.

995
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,160
They have more rush already.

996
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,660
It's all about rush already.

997
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:02,560
It's purple.

998
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,620
We'll get it next time.

999
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,020
We'll just keep the water view that one.

1000
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,620
It's a good thing we got this game early.

1001
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,680
I think we want tomb and race as well.

1002
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,520
I thought the race was the hardest one.

1003
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,180
What do you mean?

1004
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,420
Race is just like...

1005
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:23,980
I don't know.

1006
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,060
It's like experience.

1007
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,060
This game is cute though.

1008
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,020
Honestly, all of those...

1009
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:29,520
I don't know.

1010
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:29,960
We'll see.

1011
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,940
I think we can do final race though.

1012
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,680
I think Hannah will get a top 10.

1013
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,360
You don't like it?

1014
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,220
Sure.

1015
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:39,940
I'm here for a good time.

1016
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:41,620
Confidence.

1017
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:48,060
It benefits teams that might not be as Minecraft experienced.

1018
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,700
But in battle, we're going to absolutely destroy everybody.

1019
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:52,900
I'm sorry, we are.

1020
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,040
We actually are.

1021
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,880
What is race?

1022
00:44:58,980 --> 00:44:59,960
Is it like a race?

1023
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,200
It's like parkour.

1024
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:02,980
It's what you've trained for.

1025
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Oh, yes.

1026
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,380
I've been training my whole life for this.

1027
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,040
Yeah, you've been training for this.

1028
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:14,920
Can you turn down the Minecraft music?

1029
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,360
Yeah, I think.

1030
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:18,380
Yeah.

1031
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:22,880
It's good music, but it's so loud.

1032
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:24,640
Yeah.

1033
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:28,520
Alright.

1034
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:39,470
Wait, where am I on the leaderboard?

1035
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:40,910
We have seven minutes.

1036
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:42,810
There's a cute guy in my room.

1037
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:45,870
Let's fucking go, guys!

1038
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:46,890
True.

1039
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:49,550
We're above the other team with the new player.

1040
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:50,150
Exactly!

1041
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:52,210
We're above...

1042
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:53,790
Isn't Toppo the Minecraft player?

1043
00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:56,170
We're above that guy.

1044
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:57,770
He is a Minecraft player.

1045
00:45:57,950 --> 00:45:58,650
This is true.

1046
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:01,250
Oh my god, we're above Toppo!

1047
00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:03,690
Oh shit, am I going to get like flamed?

1048
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:11,930
As an individual who is not a Minecraft content creator, I don't know much.

1049
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:15,550
Oh my gosh.

1050
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:18,650
Dude, he is a Minecraft dude.

1051
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:21,290
Oh my god, I'm better than a Minecraft dude.

1052
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:22,350
I play Apex.

1053
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:22,690
I play Apex.

1054
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:24,810
Dude, you just...

1055
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:30,690
I don't learn.

1056
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:32,550
I learn nothing.

1057
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:34,390
Hello Kazoo.

1058
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:39,290
Kazoo, get the fuck you guy.

1059
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:42,630
No, you don't understand.

1060
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:44,970
There was a giant fly in my room during order up.

1061
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:46,750
Wait, do you have like...

1062
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:48,090
Do you have something open?

1063
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:50,630
What do you mean something open?

1064
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,670
Okay, why would there be a fly in your room?

1065
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:54,730
Are you living like...

1066
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:55,590
Because my door was open.

1067
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:57,990
Oh, I was going to say, are you living like...

1068
00:46:58,650 --> 00:46:59,090
Asmongold?

1069
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:00,190
You know, like his room?

1070
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:02,130
No, but I...

1071
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:05,250
I literally told Efron to essay this.

1072
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:06,970
But...

1073
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:10,730
My younger brother, he was raising maggots in his backpack.

1074
00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:12,090
And we found that yesterday.

1075
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:14,190
So like, there's a long...

1076
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:16,750
Oh, that's like...

1077
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:17,270
Like...

1078
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,530
I'm surrounded by fuck you guys.

1079
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:21,930
You were just raised like that.

1080
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:24,290
My neighbors live like Asmongold.

1081
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:27,370
So for six months, I was just having flies on my desk.

1082
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:28,430
Oh my god.

1083
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:32,430
Until the exterminators got like a warrant to go inside their apartment and clean it up.

1084
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:33,630
Wait, is he a hoarder?

1085
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,130
I don't know.

1086
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:39,290
There was like a bunch of tiny fungus flies around me at all times.

1087
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:39,770
That's crazy.

1088
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:42,890
I'd be playing Overwatch tournaments and there's like three flies in my field of view.

1089
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:44,590
Oh my god.

1090
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:45,870
That's crazy.

1091
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,550
You were living with fuck you guys.

1092
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:48,970
It was so bad.

1093
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:51,610
Sounds fucking terrible.

1094
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:53,050
Oh my god.

1095
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:55,550
Hey, but at least the rent was cheap, right?

1096
00:47:56,350 --> 00:47:56,690
No.

1097
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:01,270
You'd think it would like lower the rent, you know?

1098
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:02,790
Like if that was your neighbor.

1099
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:04,630
Oh.

1100
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:06,530
You'd think that.

1101
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:13,760
Hello, Miss Husky.

1102
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,480
It seems I found you once again.

1103
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,200
Hello.

1104
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:18,600
We always end up in the same place.

1105
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:21,040
Start the match.

1106
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,520
Start the match.

1107
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:24,640
Match found.

1108
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,900
Start the match.

1109
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,500
Ah, fuck you guy.

1110
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:33,560
I'm so sleepy now.

1111
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:37,620
Gumi, not everybody can be a fuck you guy.

1112
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,740
If everybody's a fuck you guy, then that's not special anymore.

1113
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:42,840
Who said it was special?

1114
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:46,260
The world is made out of fuck you guys.

1115
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,600
Gumi, are you okay?

1116
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:54,260
Why do you ask this every time we hang out?

1117
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:56,480
You know why.

1118
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,100
Have you watched the new Wicked yet?

1119
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:07,160
I have and I've sadly watched it in 3D.

1120
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:08,240
What?

1121
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,480
Dude, you didn't watch it in 4D?

1122
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:14,820
If you watch it in 4D, you move along with all of the creatures.

1123
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,300
It was not fun for me.

1124
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,400
It was like super vibrations.

1125
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,730
It was like you're on a fucking rollercoaster.

1126
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:30,380
I'm just trying to be like, please, I want to know what's going on.

1127
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:31,880
I don't need a rollercoaster ride.

1128
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:34,960
That's actually crazy.

1129
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,180
I've never even seen a place like that.

1130
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:40,920
Just look at 4DX movies.

1131
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,080
It's really fun.

1132
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:46,940
It's like the ride moves every time someone flips their hair or whatever.

1133
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:50,000
Yeah, you can control the vibration.

1134
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:53,740
And I put it at 1 and it was still so intense.

1135
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,200
And I'm like, bro, they're just walking.

1136
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:03,200
Why am I going through turbulence on somebody walking down the stairs?

1137
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,300
Dude, it's immersion.

1138
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:06,220
I don't like that.

1139
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:08,640
So I had that and 3D.

1140
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,500
I forgot how muted the colors are when you watch in 3D.

1141
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:13,720
Oh, really?

1142
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:16,700
Yeah, because the glasses are tinted.

1143
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:18,960
So the colors are less vibrant.

1144
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:22,760
I thought the movie was actually really good.

1145
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:30,240
I think it's good, but I feel like I would have enjoyed it more if I watched it not in 3D.

1146
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:31,700
And not on a rollercoaster.

1147
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:33,460
Yeah, maybe.

1148
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:36,760
Doki, the immersion though.

1149
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,360
I was definitely not immersed.

1150
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,220
Oh my god, are they interviewing?

1151
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,380
I swear I'm going to fucking tab.

1152
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,120
I'm going to tab and see who's in the interview.

1153
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:48,700
I'm going to call them.

1154
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:50,800
There's no one in the interview corner!

1155
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,400
What are you waiting?

1156
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,240
Nobody's getting interviewed.

1157
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,680
No one's being special.

1158
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,420
Dude, they're doing a hashtag ad right now, Doki.

1159
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:01,140
Wait, are they?

1160
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:04,700
Okay, but is it a good ad?

1161
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,340
Wait, I got kicked out.

1162
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,020
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

1163
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:13,300
I'm sorry.

1164
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,740
I'll never say that again.

1165
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:22,460
I'm sorry, I got put in the timeout corner.

1166
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:28,810
Alright, oh my gosh.

1167
00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:32,410
When are we going to start the next game?

1168
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:34,550
Woooo!

1169
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:36,450
I'm impatient.

1170
00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:38,330
Oh my god.

1171
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:41,590
We're definitely not starting.

1172
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:44,850
We never even started the timer.

1173
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:45,930
What do you mean?

1174
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:49,310
There was a 6 minute timer going.

1175
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:51,210
There was a 6 minute timer?

1176
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:52,590
And they paused it.

1177
00:51:53,830 --> 00:51:54,830
It was wild.

1178
00:51:55,090 --> 00:51:55,990
I was surprised.

1179
00:51:57,470 --> 00:51:58,850
We're being held hostage.

1180
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:01,470
You guys, sorry my mom called.

1181
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:02,390
I gotta leave.

1182
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:04,910
Nevermind, JK, I'm here.

1183
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:08,510
Hang on, I found your mom.

1184
00:52:09,610 --> 00:52:11,390
I'm down for Team Titans as well.

1185
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:13,050
Alright, I'm on race.

1186
00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:16,070
I managed to die last time in the voting section.

1187
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:16,490
Oh my god!

1188
00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:18,810
I just saw somebody get stabbed!

1189
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:21,030
I stabbed him.

1190
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:22,130
It was me.

1191
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:27,130
It was me.

1192
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:29,090
Wait, which one do we want?

1193
00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:32,790
Team Titans, honestly.

1194
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:33,630
What the purple?

1195
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:34,510
Let me go!

1196
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:34,890
No!

1197
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:39,070
It's a fucking bomb!

1198
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:43,830
Who did I vote for?

1199
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:44,850
Oh, I wanted to party.

1200
00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:45,570
Let's go.

1201
00:52:46,850 --> 00:52:47,870
Where are you?

1202
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:49,250
I'm partying right now.

1203
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:50,430
I'm partying with the cool kids.

1204
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:51,030
With the winners.

1205
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:56,470
Wait, we're the winners.

1206
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:02,310
They're literally two ranks above us.

1207
00:53:02,830 --> 00:53:04,350
No, no, it's okay.

1208
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:06,270
Alright, it's time.

1209
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:07,570
It's Dark and Darker time.

1210
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:09,050
Awesome.

1211
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:11,230
Alright, I'm gonna go with Goomy.

1212
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:13,610
Oh, this looks like Dark and Darker.

1213
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:16,110
Yeah, but wait, you've never even played it.

1214
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:16,770
How would you know?

1215
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:21,010
We could have been gaslighted.

1216
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:22,610
We've been gaslighting you this entire time.

1217
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:23,670
Oh, true.

1218
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:26,470
Dark and Darker is actually very bright and happy.

1219
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:27,690
Oh!

1220
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:32,510
Make sure everyone's brightness is on 100% because I was an idiot last time and didn't have it.

1221
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:33,230
Bright and brightness.

1222
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:36,950
Yeah, but then how would I be immersed?

1223
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:39,150
I don't know.

1224
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:40,470
Oh, true, that's very important.

1225
00:53:40,490 --> 00:53:41,790
That's true, you gotta be immersed.

1226
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:42,870
It's still really dark.

1227
00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:45,230
But is it Darker?

1228
00:53:46,450 --> 00:53:51,450
If we find the boss room, if both of us are there, we could do it.

1229
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:55,830
We'll wait for Feinberg to roll up and then steal it from him.

1230
00:53:58,490 --> 00:54:01,410
So Ant, the merchant, what do we do?

1231
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:03,710
We sell our less good loot or something?

1232
00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:13,410
Yeah, so if you have a full inventory and you need to sell loot and you don't want to leave yet, you find a merchant and you give him all of your least valuable stuff or stuff that doesn't stack and sell it to him.

1233
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:20,050
I'm not even gonna lie, I have a feeling in my bones that I'm about to sell, so maybe we should all try and stay close together-ish.

1234
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:26,030
As long as somebody can get to your body, we can res you if you don't die and somebody else loots you.

1235
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:34,770
I think the main thing is making sure that eventually you work your way into the middle enough because the map decays, right?

1236
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:41,450
It's sort of scary if you're at the outside.

1237
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:44,210
I would say going through this room, we should go straight ahead.

1238
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:46,830
What if I go left?

1239
00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:52,090
If you go left, just make sure that you know where to go inwards so you don't get caught in the decaying room.

1240
00:54:54,370 --> 00:54:55,810
How does the shield work?

1241
00:54:56,690 --> 00:54:57,550
That's the map.

1242
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:02,990
You can remove the map from your opponent.

1243
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:05,190
It only has one or two durability.

1244
00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:07,550
It only takes a couple hits before it goes away.

1245
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:09,470
It has to be in your... okay.

1246
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:13,430
You don't have the opponent, you can just hold it and block with it if you need to run away.

1247
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:15,130
There's no sprinting or anything in this.

1248
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:16,950
It's all just a set movement speed.

1249
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:19,030
Did you think the map was our shield?

1250
00:55:20,170 --> 00:55:25,370
No, I was trying to hold the shield and the map and it's just like jumping up and down on my screen.

1251
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:29,210
We're all going through.

1252
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:34,330
If you break those or you kill mobs, it'll drop loot and it'll have a little money value on them.

1253
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:35,730
The better...

1254
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:37,790
gems are worth a lot of money and they stack.

1255
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:39,950
Higher tier armor is worth more money.

1256
00:55:41,110 --> 00:55:43,390
Do we have to sell everything before we leave?

1257
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:46,130
No, if you go through the portal, it auto-sells.

1258
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:49,370
Yeah, so when you go through the portal, whatever you have on you is banked as money.

1259
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:54,510
But if you have a full inventory and the game is only halfway over, you can go find a merchant and sell some of your stuff.

1260
00:55:54,990 --> 00:56:00,570
It's a discount, so you're not going to get the full value, but that lets you get more stuff to take out later because you have more inventory room.

1261
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:02,910
Should we split like three and two?

1262
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:04,290
I think we can split up a bit.

1263
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:07,370
As long as you aren't getting cornered by mobs, you probably won't die.

1264
00:56:07,370 --> 00:56:10,390
So just be aware of where you are and where the mobs are around you.

1265
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:13,530
I always kill mobs before I loot stuff, generally.

1266
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:19,610
But there will be candles on the ground, so if you need to find a portal to get out, look for the purple candles.

1267
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:21,970
You just want to follow them as they get bigger and bigger stacks.

1268
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:24,990
It'll start as one, and then it'll go to two candles on the ground and three and so on.

1269
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:26,710
But they don't spawn until later on.

1270
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:30,930
Yeah, so to get out of the portal, you have to go to the middle of the map.

1271
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:32,150
So we're not going to split for that now.

1272
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:35,750
I think there's candles for the merchants too.

1273
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:37,310
There's like cyan candles or something.

1274
00:56:37,370 --> 00:56:37,750
I don't know.

1275
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:39,090
We'll be fine.

1276
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:39,930
I'm ready.

1277
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:41,470
I'm ready!

1278
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:43,970
Doki and I are going slower together.

1279
00:56:44,770 --> 00:56:46,690
I guess I have to follow Doki if I feel like it.

1280
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:49,150
Yeah, you follow me, I'll lead the way.

1281
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:49,550
Okay.

1282
00:56:52,270 --> 00:56:52,910
Watch this.

1283
00:56:53,130 --> 00:56:55,630
If you get better armor, you can put it on if you want.

1284
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:58,910
Like, gold armor is better than sort of better than leather.

1285
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:01,770
And if you need torches to see, you can put torches down.

1286
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:04,030
Just make sure you put them on all of you too.

1287
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:05,250
Oh, this is fun.

1288
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:07,950
Oh shit!

1289
00:57:08,070 --> 00:57:09,030
Oh shit!

1290
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:10,670
Wait, these guys are stronger now.

1291
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:17,950
Hey guys, hey, Gumi, why did you run away from me?

1292
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:20,410
Where are you, Doki?

1293
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:20,990
Oh no.

1294
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:23,330
Gumi, Gumi, Gumi, please.

1295
00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:26,630
Gumi, I went in there hoping you'd help me.

1296
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:29,050
Where are you?

1297
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:29,530
Nice.

1298
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:33,730
It's already over.

1299
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:36,190
Where are you?

1300
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:37,890
No, but I might.

1301
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:44,290
It's okay, I'm okay now.

1302
00:57:44,990 --> 00:57:45,510
I'm okay.

1303
00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:48,850
Gumi ran away from me.

1304
00:57:49,390 --> 00:57:52,170
I was literally in the same room that you told me to go in.

1305
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:53,010
No, you're not.

1306
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:54,030
I see you.

1307
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:55,350
I see you.

1308
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:57,090
Oh, there's a creepy staircase.

1309
00:57:57,690 --> 00:58:00,970
There's another, like, weird button here.

1310
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:01,850
Which one do you want to go down?

1311
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:04,450
Here's the middle.

1312
00:58:05,630 --> 00:58:06,190
I don't know.

1313
00:58:06,970 --> 00:58:07,450
Left.

1314
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:09,010
Left is promising.

1315
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:10,330
I'm just swapping my equipment.

1316
00:58:11,850 --> 00:58:13,010
I don't know what left is.

1317
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:14,870
Wait, let's go down here.

1318
00:58:15,630 --> 00:58:16,790
Okay, okay, I'm coming.

1319
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:18,250
Doki, I'm here.

1320
00:58:18,350 --> 00:58:18,890
Fuck you guys.

1321
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:20,810
That one needs more loot, right?

1322
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:23,230
Ooh, I found planets.

1323
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:24,170
Alright, I got him.

1324
00:58:25,190 --> 00:58:26,710
There's another fucking guy over here.

1325
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:29,430
This music is so freaking loud.

1326
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:30,570
Yeah, I approve.

1327
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:33,970
I might need to turn that shit down.

1328
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:35,050
Do you want to come down here?

1329
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:36,510
Yeah, let's go.

1330
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:37,590
I hear spiders.

1331
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:39,210
I'm a creepy guy.

1332
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:42,110
That's better armor.

1333
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:44,490
Doki, I opened the door.

1334
00:58:45,370 --> 00:58:46,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go, let's go.

1335
00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:47,490
It helps you survive a lot better.

1336
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:49,850
That's fine.

1337
00:58:49,850 --> 00:58:51,390
There's better armor.

1338
00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:52,730
Oh my god.

1339
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:53,950
We have to circle back.

1340
00:58:54,450 --> 00:58:56,590
Oh, no!

1341
00:58:57,710 --> 00:58:59,010
I died next to you.

1342
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:01,010
I died next to you.

1343
00:59:01,390 --> 00:59:01,970
Want to go this way?

1344
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:04,150
It's okay, we keep all our equipment.

1345
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:06,930
I think you need to crouch next to Doki and you can respawn.

1346
00:59:08,050 --> 00:59:08,730
Hannah, do you know?

1347
00:59:09,390 --> 00:59:11,530
Yeah, you just have to- it's like Fortnite, I think.

1348
00:59:12,270 --> 00:59:12,570
Yeah.

1349
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:14,910
It's okay, we keep all our stuff.

1350
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:17,270
Oh, you gotta keep crouching.

1351
00:59:17,270 --> 00:59:19,290
I'm just being revived, but then you stop.

1352
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:20,230
I see you stopping.

1353
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:23,390
Oh, I have to hold right click!

1354
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:25,530
Oh, okay, I didn't know that.

1355
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:26,850
I haven't revived someone before.

1356
00:59:27,070 --> 00:59:28,130
Sorry, I've never revived someone before.

1357
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:30,110
It's okay, no.

1358
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:31,990
It's okay, we know now.

1359
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:34,470
I think ladder can't.

1360
00:59:34,770 --> 00:59:36,190
I forgot these guys are stronger.

1361
00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:38,630
Yeah, let's go, let's go, let's go.

1362
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:40,990
Hannah, you can get a lot more gems from them, by the way.

1363
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:43,170
Wait, I'm pressing the door.

1364
00:59:43,870 --> 00:59:47,530
Doki, there's an evil per- What do you think this button does?

1365
00:59:48,510 --> 00:59:49,090
I'm okay.

1366
00:59:50,450 --> 00:59:52,470
Oh, look, there's a thingy in here.

1367
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:54,490
Oh, there's another button over here.

1368
00:59:54,570 --> 00:59:55,770
Yeah, press it, press it, press it.

1369
00:59:55,830 --> 00:59:57,050
Something good is gonna happen.

1370
00:59:57,410 --> 00:59:58,070
Watch this.

1371
00:59:58,910 --> 01:00:00,130
Do you want any potions?

1372
01:00:00,310 --> 01:00:01,490
I'm good.

1373
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:02,850
Oh my god, gold!

1374
01:00:06,430 --> 01:00:07,010
It's gold.

1375
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:08,170
Do I wear the gold armor?

1376
01:00:08,410 --> 01:00:09,910
I'm going up here, just for a sec.

1377
01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:12,950
I'm gonna turn down the music, it's so loud.

1378
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:14,710
It's really loud.

1379
01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:15,850
Yeah, I turned it down.

1380
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:17,710
There's another button, should I press it?

1381
01:00:18,370 --> 01:00:19,130
Yeah, press it.

1382
01:00:19,350 --> 01:00:21,110
Do we go this way?

1383
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:23,790
Look, this is where I died.

1384
01:00:25,130 --> 01:00:26,470
There's a boss room in front of me.

1385
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:29,710
I don't know if any of you are near me, but...

1386
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:30,070
I'm here.

1387
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:33,330
If you guys are still on the border of the map, by the way, you probably want to start moving your way inwards.

1388
01:00:33,850 --> 01:00:36,990
It's a little scary to be on the border when it's okay.

1389
01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:38,510
Okay, we'll move inwards.

1390
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:40,030
Hannah, we can do the boss the other hand if you come to me.

1391
01:00:40,030 --> 01:00:40,950
Okay, let's move inwards.

1392
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:42,470
I'm trying to figure out how to get to you.

1393
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:43,790
Okay, this way?

1394
01:00:44,070 --> 01:00:45,890
Coming over.

1395
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:47,890
We have to go this way.

1396
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:48,690
Where's my body?

1397
01:00:49,010 --> 01:00:50,510
I think the door is under me.

1398
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:52,790
How do I get down?

1399
01:00:54,770 --> 01:00:58,310
I wish it was more intuitive of how to go up and down the map.

1400
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:04,330
Maybe this way.

1401
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:05,830
We're following me.

1402
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:07,250
Awesome.

1403
01:01:09,450 --> 01:01:10,610
Now what?

1404
01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:13,350
There's like three skeletons behind us.

1405
01:01:13,410 --> 01:01:14,670
We're inwards.

1406
01:01:16,030 --> 01:01:17,130
There's so many.

1407
01:01:17,730 --> 01:01:18,750
We're figuring it out.

1408
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:19,610
We're so smart.

1409
01:01:24,030 --> 01:01:25,170
Oh, I got one.

1410
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:26,590
I just need pants now.

1411
01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:28,310
I see some of you guys.

1412
01:01:28,610 --> 01:01:29,530
There's a lever.

1413
01:01:30,350 --> 01:01:31,650
Let's go.

1414
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:33,570
Wait, if you guys...

1415
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:35,430
Um...

1416
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:36,190
I have a villager.

1417
01:01:36,830 --> 01:01:37,990
I have something here.

1418
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:41,430
If you have extra stuff you want to sell Hannah, that's worth doing.

1419
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:43,650
Can we sell our armor?

1420
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:45,150
Uh...

1421
01:01:45,150 --> 01:01:47,030
Extra armor you can sell, yeah.

1422
01:01:47,090 --> 01:01:48,650
There's so many things down there.

1423
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:51,850
Look at the prices and try to sell the least valuable stuff first.

1424
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:53,730
Don't go down.

1425
01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:54,870
Don't go down, Gumi.

1426
01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:55,890
Don't go down.

1427
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:58,650
The clay shards are good because those stack.

1428
01:01:59,270 --> 01:02:01,310
I found the boss room.

1429
01:02:01,770 --> 01:02:02,170
Um...

1430
01:02:02,170 --> 01:02:02,890
Gumi...

1431
01:02:04,910 --> 01:02:05,310
Gumi...

1432
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:08,890
I went down.

1433
01:02:09,090 --> 01:02:09,630
What do you mean?

1434
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:11,830
I told you.

1435
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:13,670
I told you not to go down.

1436
01:02:14,310 --> 01:02:15,830
But I was stuck down.

1437
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:17,530
Do you see the white room?

1438
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:18,510
The white outline?

1439
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:21,470
I'm going too high, I think.

1440
01:02:21,670 --> 01:02:22,710
I don't really know what's going on.

1441
01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:23,770
Gumi, where are you?

1442
01:02:23,770 --> 01:02:24,530
Gumi and Doki.

1443
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:27,390
I'm saving Doki.

1444
01:02:28,550 --> 01:02:30,230
She's saving private Doki.

1445
01:02:30,970 --> 01:02:32,590
There's a chest right there.

1446
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:32,890
Nice.

1447
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:34,750
That's my other tombstone.

1448
01:02:35,110 --> 01:02:36,050
I can't, I don't know.

1449
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:38,870
Yeah, there's another tomb.

1450
01:02:39,710 --> 01:02:42,030
Okay, I'm going to be more careful for real.

1451
01:02:42,190 --> 01:02:42,690
I promise.

1452
01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:48,270
If you're too high and you can't find a door for it, it's probably like...

1453
01:02:48,270 --> 01:02:49,930
Wait, what's stronger, iron or chainmail?

1454
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:51,930
Wait, maybe we have to go up here?

1455
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:52,590
I found one.

1456
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:56,070
If you're not towards the middle, you need to move your way in a little bit.

1457
01:02:56,190 --> 01:02:57,590
How do we get up?

1458
01:02:57,730 --> 01:02:58,730
We're like in the boss room.

1459
01:03:00,050 --> 01:03:01,710
You're a different one from me.

1460
01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:06,630
One of you needs to aggro the boss, and the other one needs to crit it out.

1461
01:03:08,330 --> 01:03:10,230
Okay, we're in the boss room.

1462
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:13,450
Whoever aggroes the boss, the other one can just...

1463
01:03:13,450 --> 01:03:14,290
Oh, Hannah, I'm here with you guys.

1464
01:03:14,410 --> 01:03:15,750
I don't know if the boss is in here or not.

1465
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:16,510
I don't know.

1466
01:03:16,890 --> 01:03:19,310
Let's go down and see what's going on.

1467
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:22,370
Let's go down.

1468
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:23,090
I'm going down.

1469
01:03:23,210 --> 01:03:24,230
I'm going down with you.

1470
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:27,250
As long as we both find...

1471
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:29,870
Oh wait, as long as we both find the exit together...

1472
01:03:29,870 --> 01:03:31,670
I'm not sure if I see anybody.

1473
01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:33,390
I'll be careful.

1474
01:03:36,990 --> 01:03:37,790
Oh, I...

1475
01:03:37,790 --> 01:03:39,390
Watch out, PVP!

1476
01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:41,370
Oh, shit.

1477
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:41,750
Let's kill them.

1478
01:03:42,890 --> 01:03:43,390
Hannah, I'm coming.

1479
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:47,070
Yeah, kill them.

1480
01:03:47,070 --> 01:03:47,630
Kill them, kill them, kill them.

1481
01:03:48,770 --> 01:03:49,650
Oh, I can't.

1482
01:03:49,930 --> 01:03:50,670
Of course.

1483
01:03:51,130 --> 01:03:53,150
Okay, let's just go into the boss room then, I guess.

1484
01:03:54,370 --> 01:03:55,790
There's like 20 things in here.

1485
01:03:55,870 --> 01:03:57,250
Wait, this is PVP area.

1486
01:03:58,990 --> 01:04:01,510
Okay, I'm not even going to entertain that.

1487
01:04:01,610 --> 01:04:02,190
That's so dumb.

1488
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:04,410
There's so many.

1489
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:06,850
And my inventory is full.

1490
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:07,450
What should I do?

1491
01:04:07,950 --> 01:04:10,670
We have 4 minutes left, so we should try and find the exit.

1492
01:04:10,970 --> 01:04:11,790
Should I find Merchant then?

1493
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:12,870
Yeah.

1494
01:04:14,290 --> 01:04:15,250
Wait, there is a boss!

1495
01:04:15,330 --> 01:04:15,970
It's an Iron Golem!

1496
01:04:16,510 --> 01:04:17,590
Guys, guys, guys!

1497
01:04:18,550 --> 01:04:19,290
Oh, we're coming over.

1498
01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:23,070
Whoever has the Golem on them should run away, and the other person should just kite and try and get it.

1499
01:04:23,270 --> 01:04:24,970
Let's start critting out the Iron Golem.

1500
01:04:25,630 --> 01:04:26,110
In a second.

1501
01:04:26,870 --> 01:04:27,570
Oh, sorry.

1502
01:04:28,110 --> 01:04:28,750
Run, run, run.

1503
01:04:29,650 --> 01:04:30,250
I'm running.

1504
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:33,230
Well, I'm getting shot at by the Skelly.

1505
01:04:34,050 --> 01:04:34,850
Nice, Kimmy, you got that?

1506
01:04:35,710 --> 01:04:36,890
Yeah, yeah, we got it.

1507
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:38,770
We gotta find the exit soon.

1508
01:04:38,770 --> 01:04:40,030
Behind you, right here, right here, right here.

1509
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:42,390
We have 4 minutes, guys.

1510
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:43,770
We have to find the exit soon.

1511
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:49,880
No, bro.

1512
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:51,360
They're out, they're out, they're out.

1513
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:52,260
Oh, no!

1514
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:55,120
I don't even know.

1515
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:55,580
Team PVP is down.

1516
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,540
Team PVP is gone in a little bit, by the way.

1517
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:57,840
Be careful.

1518
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:00,740
We should find a way out then.

1519
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:02,600
This is the portal room.

1520
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:05,180
So look for the purple candles on the ground, guys.

1521
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:06,600
And that will lead us to a portal.

1522
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:11,400
I need more, like, high value stuff.

1523
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:13,660
Okay, so what...

1524
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:15,220
There's some potions here.

1525
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:18,480
This is where Ducky and I came from, no?

1526
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:20,520
Yeah.

1527
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:25,120
Okay, Ant, we have to figure out the exit, like, right now.

1528
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,140
Yeah, well, we have a little bit of time.

1529
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,300
I'm trying to figure out...

1530
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:29,340
I'm going in this room over here.

1531
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:32,000
Oh, there's a candle here, there's a candle here.

1532
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:33,880
Okay, everyone come over here, if you guys can.

1533
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:36,260
And also, drop your leather armor, if you have it.

1534
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:36,580
It's, like, really useful.

1535
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:37,180
It's, like, worthless.

1536
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:41,180
Leather armor's bad, stone tools aren't really worth anything.

1537
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,140
I have, like, gold.

1538
01:05:42,140 --> 01:05:43,880
That's fine, I have inventory space.

1539
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:45,800
So, we need to find these purple candles.

1540
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:47,820
We found, there's one candle here.

1541
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:50,220
Yeah, there's some real stuff in that room.

1542
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:51,180
Yeah, there's two right here.

1543
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:53,560
The portal's right here, the portal's right here.

1544
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:54,920
We need to find a button for it.

1545
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:55,800
Is there going to be a button somewhere?

1546
01:05:56,180 --> 01:05:57,060
Unless it's not open yet.

1547
01:05:57,300 --> 01:06:00,940
Okay, the portal's not open yet, so we need to remember how to get back here.

1548
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:02,040
This is how we're going to get back here, okay?

1549
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:03,080
This is how we're exiting.

1550
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:05,660
You can stay in the area and look for loot, but this is how we're getting back.

1551
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:07,080
How does that sound?

1552
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:09,440
There's, like, a...

1553
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:11,240
I don't know what that is.

1554
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:11,720
Is it a warden?

1555
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:14,660
Does chainmail armor sell for anything?

1556
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:16,720
Uh, you can hover over it.

1557
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:18,020
It sells for two, it's not that good.

1558
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:20,040
There's nothing.

1559
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:22,940
Get rid of, uh...

1560
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:24,260
I don't even know.

1561
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:26,140
Are they torches?

1562
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:29,060
Torches don't really sell for anything, so...

1563
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:31,360
Oh, my inventory's not full, I think.

1564
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:33,500
Yeah, try and make it, like, as full as possible.

1565
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:35,800
Like, iron swords are a lot better...

1566
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:36,860
than chainmail.

1567
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,460
I think iron and gold are the most valuable.

1568
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:40,260
Oh, there's another portal right here.

1569
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:41,440
There's another portal right here if we need to get out.

1570
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:42,560
Nice!

1571
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:43,480
Potions are good for me.

1572
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:46,700
Um...

1573
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:47,880
Let's also use arrows.

1574
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,520
I just don't think arrows are really that valuable right now.

1575
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:50,640
Oh, portals are now open!

1576
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:53,920
So, as long as... make sure that you know how to get back to the portal.

1577
01:06:54,020 --> 01:06:55,140
Is the portal by me and Doki?

1578
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:55,840
Doki's behind us.

1579
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,360
Yeah, is there, like, anybody can...

1580
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:59,660
Oh, there's peasants here.

1581
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:03,160
So, like, it's not one use, right?

1582
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:04,840
No, no, no, it's not one use.

1583
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:05,440
That's good.

1584
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:07,600
There's a lot of mobs right here.

1585
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:08,840
I'm, like, freaking out a little bit.

1586
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:09,960
Is this the boss room?

1587
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:10,980
Oh, this is the boss room.

1588
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:13,580
Uh, I think the warden's in this room.

1589
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:14,580
I'm a little scared to go in this room.

1590
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:15,720
I don't know if you guys want to do this or not.

1591
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:16,600
I think it's a little scary.

1592
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:17,580
One minute!

1593
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:18,180
Woo!

1594
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:20,140
Game over in a minute thirty.

1595
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:23,460
Um, I would say grab any last minute things and then go find your way back to a portal.

1596
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,000
Alright, I'm heading over.

1597
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:26,940
There's a portal down here.

1598
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:27,840
Okay.

1599
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:30,120
Let's get all these things here and then we'll go back.

1600
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:30,460
Alright.

1601
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:31,480
Awesome.

1602
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:36,160
Oh, there's an emerald here.

1603
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:39,280
Purple is here.

1604
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:40,440
Doki, pick up that potion!

1605
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:41,140
It's expensive.

1606
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:42,140
Okay.

1607
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:46,000
Uh, chain mail.

1608
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:48,160
I mean, if you don't have anything else to grab, I would say so, probably.

1609
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:49,340
Alright, I'm heading over.

1610
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:51,400
Okay, Doki, let's go back here, Doki.

1611
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:52,040
I'm gonna come to you.

1612
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,300
There's a portal right where we just were, Doki, in that room back there.

1613
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:54,880
Whoa!

1614
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:56,180
I got shot at.

1615
01:07:56,780 --> 01:07:58,020
That scared the shit out of me.

1616
01:07:58,100 --> 01:07:58,920
I'm going in!

1617
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:00,720
Goodbye, guys!

1618
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:03,600
Nice.

1619
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:05,160
We have so many points.

1620
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:08,720
Yeah, but that's three of us.

1621
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:11,440
That's three of us dropping in.

1622
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:14,220
Okay, we're good.

1623
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:14,640
We're good.

1624
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:16,860
Yay!

1625
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:18,960
I think we're the first full team out.

1626
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:21,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so we'll see how the other...

1627
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:22,560
We got out.

1628
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:24,040
Yeah, no, that's it.

1629
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:25,280
The main thing is that we all got out.

1630
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:26,040
I think that's really important.

1631
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:27,960
Yeah, yeah, no, last time I...

1632
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:30,620
My last block was I did not get out.

1633
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:33,540
I also got locked in the first time I played this.

1634
01:08:33,780 --> 01:08:35,020
So, uh...

1635
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:35,780
It was already an upgrade.

1636
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:39,060
By the way, there was a boss.

1637
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:40,780
Wait, Red has not got out.

1638
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:42,440
Red team is still all in.

1639
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:44,620
They're probably trolling.

1640
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:45,720
Yeah, they're trolling.

1641
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:47,260
Yeah, they found it.

1642
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:48,800
No, actually, two of them don't.

1643
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:50,800
Yeah, two of them haven't found it.

1644
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:54,000
We did good.

1645
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:56,420
Yeah, we got four.

1646
01:08:56,580 --> 01:08:58,120
Yeah, the scores are super close too.

1647
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:00,980
We actually, yeah, we did really good.

1648
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:02,820
Oh, what happened to Lime?

1649
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:03,420
Oh, no.

1650
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:07,500
All I'm saying is I might have died two times, but we got out.

1651
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:08,560
Yeah, that's okay.

1652
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:09,200
You got res.

1653
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:11,800
Oh my gosh, I was so focused.

1654
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:12,980
I was a little bit stressed.

1655
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:17,920
Oh, there's a tomb warden in here.

1656
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:19,480
Oh, that would have been fun.

1657
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:21,220
No, we saw him.

1658
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:23,560
We saw him and we walked away.

1659
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:26,520
Okay, we're no longer in seventh.

1660
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:27,080
We're climbing.

1661
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:28,040
Let's go!

1662
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:29,060
Look at us go!

1663
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:31,920
It's really close points anyway, so...

1664
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:34,980
Yeah, I'm fine with that.

1665
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:36,240
I think that was good.

1666
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:37,500
I was really scared about that game, to be honest.

1667
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:40,400
My one time playing it, I got locked in, so...

1668
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:40,920
Yeah, me too.

1669
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:43,360
Yeah, we didn't get into any decay or anything.

1670
01:09:52,090 --> 01:09:54,510
Okay, an alleged three minute timer on the side.

1671
01:09:54,570 --> 01:09:55,210
I don't know if that's going to be true.

1672
01:09:55,510 --> 01:09:56,410
Yeah, at least it's not seven.

1673
01:09:56,990 --> 01:09:58,050
It's not seven anymore.

1674
01:09:59,150 --> 01:09:59,990
Oh, thank God.

1675
01:10:04,430 --> 01:10:07,330
I apologize for any sick noises I make.

1676
01:10:07,490 --> 01:10:08,110
I'm dying.

1677
01:10:08,410 --> 01:10:09,210
Me too.

1678
01:10:10,510 --> 01:10:11,710
I'm dying of bed as well.

1679
01:10:13,430 --> 01:10:15,330
Yeah, I've been sick for three months now.

1680
01:10:15,930 --> 01:10:16,430
I know.

1681
01:10:16,430 --> 01:10:17,410
Oh my gosh.

1682
01:10:17,950 --> 01:10:21,050
You need to message me back about what I last asked for.

1683
01:10:21,190 --> 01:10:21,670
So I can find it for you.

1684
01:10:21,690 --> 01:10:22,550
Oh yeah, that's true.

1685
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:25,910
Oh look, I got 19 plays last game.

1686
01:10:26,050 --> 01:10:26,990
Wait, who am I above?

1687
01:10:29,150 --> 01:10:31,410
Guys, look at the people I'm above.

1688
01:10:37,210 --> 01:10:39,830
Look at all these minecrafties.

1689
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:43,570
Oh my God.

1690
01:10:44,350 --> 01:10:44,850
Nice.

1691
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:46,330
Oh my God, okay, SKN12.

1692
01:10:46,590 --> 01:10:48,850
Wow, SKNGamer.

1693
01:10:50,990 --> 01:10:53,170
Go to spawn.

1694
01:10:57,230 --> 01:10:58,790
Alright, individual tab.

1695
01:10:59,530 --> 01:11:00,310
Oh shit!

1696
01:11:00,570 --> 01:11:02,010
Middle of the pack, let's go.

1697
01:11:03,070 --> 01:11:05,050
Being average in a minecraft...

1698
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:08,050
minecrafter filled lobby is pretty good.

1699
01:11:09,730 --> 01:11:10,190
Poor green.

1700
01:11:11,430 --> 01:11:12,690
Yeah, I would say poor green.

1701
01:11:12,690 --> 01:11:15,050
They had a rough run, I guess.

1702
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,020
Okay, but guys, don't worry.

1703
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:22,520
We still have battle.

1704
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:23,720
True.

1705
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:28,640
Battle's gonna be like 9000 points, guys, so don't worry.

1706
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:35,100
last block wars, I almost took my team from like 10th to almost 2nd.

1707
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:37,400
Like 4 points from 2nd.

1708
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:38,040
There's 18.

1709
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:39,680
Because of that.

1710
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:44,440
What happened to the other two teams?

1711
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:51,860
Guys, it's just me.

1712
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:57,200
She locked in for that one.

1713
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:58,000
She locked in.

1714
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:01,900
No, guys, that was just a special event.

1715
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:04,120
Like I was doing really, really good that day.

1716
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:06,520
Wait, stop.

1717
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:07,200
Stop.

1718
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:09,220
That's so bad.

1719
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:14,020
I think... I mean, honestly, as long as race isn't the last three, I think we'll be okay with everything else.

1720
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:16,240
Maybe split, I don't know.

1721
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:17,680
I think race...

1722
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:20,360
I think everybody's trying to make race the last one.

1723
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:22,340
Yeah, I hope not.

1724
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:23,780
That's a scary game.

1725
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:25,240
Yeah, it's just like...

1726
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:26,840
I don't know.

1727
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:31,720
Well, it's like a map that a lot of people here have played before, so like, it's not good for us.

1728
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:36,240
I feel my life force draining away each break we have.

1729
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:41,060
Oh, my God.

1730
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:41,520
Oh, my God.

1731
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:41,620
Oh, my God.

1732
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:43,420
Oh, guys, six seconds left, guys.

1733
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:44,400
Let's go.

1734
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:45,900
Oh, my...

1735
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:48,840
Oh...

1736
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:50,260
Oh...

1737
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:51,860
I'm gonna lay in bed.

1738
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:52,840
I'm gonna lay in bed.

1739
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:53,740
Yay!

1740
01:12:57,820 --> 01:12:58,460
Let's go.

1741
01:12:58,920 --> 01:12:59,840
I can't even lie.

1742
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:00,920
Oh, my God.

1743
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:02,120
Okay, who's gonna...

1744
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:02,840
I have a TNT.

1745
01:13:02,980 --> 01:13:03,400
I'm ready.

1746
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:05,400
I'm ready to blow up one of them.

1747
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:08,660
I have to place the cat.

1748
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:10,520
I have a gully.

1749
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:11,660
No!

1750
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:13,340
No!

1751
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:16,960
I'm going here.

1752
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:19,120
I'm gonna blow up this.

1753
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:19,980
Chat, which way?

1754
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:22,480
Oh, okay, battle.

1755
01:13:23,540 --> 01:13:25,080
Okay, don't go where Fruit Brace is.

1756
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:25,820
I feel like that's battle.

1757
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:32,620
Okay, that was a terrible... I thought the TNT would be like 20 kills or some shit, but I guess I was wrong.

1758
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:34,480
I'm freaking out.

1759
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:39,260
Okay, I'm fine with either one.

1760
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:41,500
I don't really...

1761
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:43,500
Oh, Extractions is...

1762
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,020
Rainbow Six Siege, let's go.

1763
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:48,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1764
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:50,680
You just shoot.

1765
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:53,100
I forgot if it's hold or... Is it hold?

1766
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:53,500
I forgot.

1767
01:13:54,220 --> 01:13:56,740
Miss Esky, you should pop your pussy on this one.

1768
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:58,120
I will pop my pussy.

1769
01:13:58,160 --> 01:13:59,380
This is reloading, right?

1770
01:13:59,380 --> 01:14:01,420
Yeah, you have to reload your crossbow.

1771
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:10,880
Esky, because I don't know if you watched a whole... You probably did, but each person has like three hearts or something and you shoot them with a crossbow and then three times and they're dead.

1772
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:13,760
And then you have to leave through the center through a helicopter in the middle.

1773
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:18,120
You have to crouch in the middle and you get extracted like an alien.

1774
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:20,660
So do you want more kills before you leave or what?

1775
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:21,400
Yeah, you want kills.

1776
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:22,380
You want to live.

1777
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:26,000
It's team versus team, so it's 5v5.

1778
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:28,580
I mean, kills are good, but also extracting is also really good.

1779
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:32,800
So if you're like 1 HP and there's four of us and only one of them, you should just hide until we kill them.

1780
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:33,540
I see.

1781
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:39,860
It's just Valorant, but like without the thing.

1782
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:43,120
So yeah, it's like a set one heart and you... Oh, it's CSGO.

1783
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:45,340
There you go, it's like CS.

1784
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,960
I mean, they have scope bombs, they have health up, which will give you an extra heart.

1785
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,860
Is either left or right is the health up?

1786
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:53,080
I don't remember.

1787
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:53,840
How do we split?

1788
01:14:55,580 --> 01:14:59,920
I think either like 3 and 2 or we all just go on one side.

1789
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,120
Should we all go on one side?

1790
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:03,440
I really like one side.

1791
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:06,680
Last time I played on this map, one side, it was not great.

1792
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:07,440
You got split up.

1793
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:10,240
I think being... Split up and high ground.

1794
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:13,900
Yeah, I think playing high ground and doing a 3-2 isn't bad.

1795
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:19,420
Especially if they all go one side, it's a lot easier to flank if we have people split up as well.

1796
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:25,440
I wish we could have the crossbow out now so I can see the reload.

1797
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:29,380
And SK, the crossbow reloads like instantly, basically.

1798
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:30,360
It's pretty fast.

1799
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:33,060
What was the ping?

1800
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:37,400
You'll get used to reloading and shooting really fast.

1801
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:39,580
What's the swap offhand key?

1802
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:40,560
Oh, press F.

1803
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:41,260
F, F, F.

1804
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:42,440
F is the default.

1805
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:43,680
You can ping.

1806
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:44,840
It's like Valorant ping.

1807
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:46,220
If you see somebody.

1808
01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:50,800
Ms. SK, this is just like Valorant.

1809
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:55,900
And the middle is the spike where we have to go, but only if we kill people.

1810
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:57,400
Or you can sneak in.

1811
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:00,540
Most of the time.

1812
01:16:01,540 --> 01:16:02,300
Okay, where do we all spawn?

1813
01:16:03,820 --> 01:16:06,040
So like, practice the crossbow.

1814
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:08,200
I think Kumi, is this you next to me?

1815
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:10,540
I'm next to Hanna.

1816
01:16:10,820 --> 01:16:11,060
Oh, you're next to Hanna.

1817
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,100
Do the two of you want to go try and flank on the side and the three of us stay over here?

1818
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:18,260
Hanna, I think I'm going up here.

1819
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:19,500
I'm gonna go right side.

1820
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:21,020
Hanna, go on that side or play towards middle.

1821
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:22,920
There's health either left or right.

1822
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:23,640
We'll play on the left.

1823
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:24,260
We'll play on the left side.

1824
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:26,860
Left is health up then.

1825
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:29,620
Rush for it.

1826
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:30,960
Rush for it.

1827
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,600
Go, go, go, go.

1828
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:34,780
Alright, Kumi, I'm following you.

1829
01:16:35,140 --> 01:16:36,340
Nice, get the health up.

1830
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:39,040
There's three right side.

1831
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:41,680
Oh, I got hit once.

1832
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:43,000
We need to help them.

1833
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:43,320
We need to help them.

1834
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:44,540
Try and get a flank off.

1835
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:46,280
They're on me.

1836
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:47,320
I'm here.

1837
01:16:47,780 --> 01:16:48,060
I'm looking.

1838
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:50,700
I'm going behind.

1839
01:16:51,380 --> 01:16:52,240
Did you bomb me?

1840
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:56,840
I don't want to die.

1841
01:16:58,540 --> 01:16:59,320
Joe is right here.

1842
01:16:59,540 --> 01:17:01,040
I got Joe.

1843
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:02,040
He's two hearts.

1844
01:17:03,020 --> 01:17:03,520
I hit one.

1845
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:04,020
I hit him.

1846
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:05,700
They're all on me.

1847
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:06,280
I got surrounded.

1848
01:17:08,220 --> 01:17:09,000
It's okay.

1849
01:17:09,820 --> 01:17:11,240
They're all pushing you.

1850
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:11,600
Sneak is two.

1851
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,280
All four of them together right there.

1852
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,180
I don't know if the flank is clear.

1853
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:21,320
Sneak is one.

1854
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:23,820
Shadow is one too.

1855
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:26,120
Try and target the people that are low.

1856
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:27,240
I'm one heart.

1857
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:29,180
We're in their spot right there.

1858
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:30,100
Whoever is hiding here, you have a one.

1859
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:32,080
Sneak is one.

1860
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:32,600
Nice.

1861
01:17:32,820 --> 01:17:33,180
Good shot.

1862
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:37,160
Shadow is on the opposite side of the map.

1863
01:17:38,140 --> 01:17:38,460
You're going.

1864
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:39,580
I got Joe.

1865
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:40,300
I'm middle.

1866
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:42,620
You see the last one.

1867
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:44,660
You guys start checking.

1868
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:46,680
Hold on crouch.

1869
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:49,020
I'm crouching.

1870
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:50,460
No!

1871
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:53,560
It's okay.

1872
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:54,260
We won the round.

1873
01:17:57,020 --> 01:17:57,820
Good work.

1874
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:58,300
It's okay.

1875
01:17:58,380 --> 01:17:58,920
We won the round.

1876
01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:02,320
As soon as they killed Anthos, they turned around and killed me.

1877
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:04,760
I'm far left.

1878
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:05,860
I'm going up the stairs again.

1879
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:07,660
I think Hanna and Gumi do the same thing.

1880
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:09,420
I'm going right side.

1881
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:10,860
I'll scout.

1882
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:11,960
I'll look around where they are.

1883
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:13,400
Where's the extra heart?

1884
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:14,800
It's on the far side.

1885
01:18:15,220 --> 01:18:16,500
I need help.

1886
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:18,360
Just heal Hanna.

1887
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:20,660
They got health up though.

1888
01:18:20,980 --> 01:18:21,740
I'm an idiot.

1889
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:25,240
I don't know where they went.

1890
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:25,960
I don't know either.

1891
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:28,380
I'm trolling a little bit.

1892
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:28,780
I might die.

1893
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:30,420
I dropped.

1894
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:32,120
I'm heading over to Anthos.

1895
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:33,700
I see him.

1896
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:34,000
I see him.

1897
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:37,820
I got Pete's four hearts.

1898
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:39,140
I'm caught in the middle right now.

1899
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:40,500
I don't like this fight at all to be honest.

1900
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:45,380
I'm already taking two hits.

1901
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:46,240
I don't know where they are.

1902
01:18:46,980 --> 01:18:48,740
I'm just trying to...

1903
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:50,920
I died.

1904
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:53,680
There's a guy right here.

1905
01:18:54,460 --> 01:18:55,000
There's two guys.

1906
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:55,960
There's three on me.

1907
01:19:00,370 --> 01:19:01,110
Careful, Gumi.

1908
01:19:01,190 --> 01:19:02,110
There's three behind me.

1909
01:19:03,730 --> 01:19:04,470
I'm dead.

1910
01:19:05,350 --> 01:19:06,070
I'm dead.

1911
01:19:06,130 --> 01:19:06,810
There's two here.

1912
01:19:06,850 --> 01:19:07,930
I bumped into them.

1913
01:19:08,930 --> 01:19:10,010
There's three people.

1914
01:19:11,550 --> 01:19:13,130
I think it's full HP.

1915
01:19:14,430 --> 01:19:15,590
I didn't hit one of them.

1916
01:19:18,130 --> 01:19:19,850
I hit the reload off.

1917
01:19:21,670 --> 01:19:23,230
I don't know how to play this map.

1918
01:19:23,310 --> 01:19:24,330
There's so much...

1919
01:19:24,330 --> 01:19:25,770
It's high ground.

1920
01:19:26,310 --> 01:19:29,090
I don't like parkour so much to get up.

1921
01:19:29,090 --> 01:19:30,930
I think just playing high ground is better.

1922
01:19:31,070 --> 01:19:32,810
Maybe we should just play for high ground.

1923
01:19:33,810 --> 01:19:35,090
High ground is the best.

1924
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:37,090
I think maybe high ground middle.

1925
01:19:37,670 --> 01:19:38,950
I think high ground middle might be good.

1926
01:19:39,090 --> 01:19:40,930
Be wary of your sides I guess.

1927
01:19:41,290 --> 01:19:42,470
Gotta get the health.

1928
01:19:42,790 --> 01:19:43,950
Go for the health.

1929
01:19:46,050 --> 01:19:46,950
I'm running left.

1930
01:19:47,290 --> 01:19:47,470
I think.

1931
01:19:48,270 --> 01:19:49,370
How can we go left?

1932
01:19:49,990 --> 01:19:52,250
I think we come back and go to middle after.

1933
01:19:53,610 --> 01:19:54,750
Where's the extra heart?

1934
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:56,070
I see it.

1935
01:19:56,070 --> 01:19:57,250
There's three.

1936
01:19:57,810 --> 01:19:58,870
I may be dead.

1937
01:19:59,530 --> 01:20:01,050
I don't see anyone over here.

1938
01:20:01,050 --> 01:20:02,230
There's three or four of us.

1939
01:20:02,930 --> 01:20:04,870
We should push back a little bit.

1940
01:20:05,110 --> 01:20:07,050
I'm gonna try and flank behind them I guess.

1941
01:20:07,830 --> 01:20:08,930
They're all grouped up.

1942
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:10,210
What?

1943
01:20:10,510 --> 01:20:12,290
They're all together in a spawn.

1944
01:20:13,730 --> 01:20:14,570
In their spawn?

1945
01:20:15,070 --> 01:20:16,730
They're coming through middle.

1946
01:20:17,170 --> 01:20:18,070
On SK right now.

1947
01:20:19,030 --> 01:20:19,990
Two of them under you.

1948
01:20:20,290 --> 01:20:22,010
That smoke fucked me up.

1949
01:20:23,130 --> 01:20:24,330
I got confused.

1950
01:20:27,850 --> 01:20:28,610
Someone's extracting.

1951
01:20:29,170 --> 01:20:30,310
I can't shoot her.

1952
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:31,530
There's three.

1953
01:20:33,310 --> 01:20:33,890
Five versus one.

1954
01:20:35,270 --> 01:20:36,510
I'm trying to find a way around.

1955
01:20:37,110 --> 01:20:37,810
Five versus one right here.

1956
01:20:39,330 --> 01:20:40,750
SK there's one chasing me behind you.

1957
01:20:40,930 --> 01:20:42,410
They were literally...

1958
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:45,270
They just all stayed together as five and pushed.

1959
01:20:45,450 --> 01:20:46,610
That was unfortunate for me and SK.

1960
01:20:47,650 --> 01:20:48,850
There's one on you right now.

1961
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:50,930
They're coming from our spawn.

1962
01:20:50,930 --> 01:20:52,770
They're coming from our spawn to your left right now.

1963
01:20:52,950 --> 01:20:53,430
They're coming that way.

1964
01:20:53,970 --> 01:20:55,410
They're not extracting.

1965
01:20:56,770 --> 01:20:57,730
There's too many.

1966
01:20:59,090 --> 01:21:00,530
Maybe if flanking five is working.

1967
01:21:00,710 --> 01:21:01,990
We just got run down.

1968
01:21:02,130 --> 01:21:03,730
We can do that.

1969
01:21:06,350 --> 01:21:07,650
I think pushing together.

1970
01:21:08,370 --> 01:21:13,050
I think whoever is closest to the heart should try for the heart.

1971
01:21:13,490 --> 01:21:14,510
And then regroup.

1972
01:21:16,990 --> 01:21:17,490
I agree.

1973
01:21:17,690 --> 01:21:18,570
We can maybe all...

1974
01:21:19,110 --> 01:21:19,990
I'll get the heart to the right.

1975
01:21:20,310 --> 01:21:21,810
I'll get left heart and then go right.

1976
01:21:22,190 --> 01:21:23,170
Everyone else goes right.

1977
01:21:24,350 --> 01:21:25,230
Everyone else goes right.

1978
01:21:25,870 --> 01:21:26,770
I don't know if I can do it.

1979
01:21:27,290 --> 01:21:30,050
You might want to go to the middle and flank right instead of going to the heart.

1980
01:21:30,190 --> 01:21:31,490
It might be scarier to go for it alone.

1981
01:21:31,930 --> 01:21:32,630
I'm coming with you.

1982
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:35,830
Oh my god.

1983
01:21:36,430 --> 01:21:36,970
He got it.

1984
01:21:37,890 --> 01:21:38,630
I got it.

1985
01:21:39,590 --> 01:21:40,290
I couldn't get the heart.

1986
01:21:40,290 --> 01:21:42,370
And there's like one person.

1987
01:21:42,790 --> 01:21:43,070
Two hearts.

1988
01:21:44,010 --> 01:21:44,910
I'm coming over.

1989
01:21:45,870 --> 01:21:46,390
Five up is one.

1990
01:21:47,450 --> 01:21:48,110
Get five up.

1991
01:21:50,290 --> 01:21:51,610
They're shooting through that smoke.

1992
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:52,670
I'm one heart.

1993
01:21:54,450 --> 01:21:55,830
Try and play your life right now.

1994
01:21:56,090 --> 01:21:56,850
I'm playing for my life.

1995
01:21:57,490 --> 01:21:57,990
I don't see any.

1996
01:21:58,130 --> 01:22:00,830
I'm chilling.

1997
01:22:01,490 --> 01:22:03,450
I'm fighting a 1v3 right now.

1998
01:22:03,570 --> 01:22:04,230
It's bad.

1999
01:22:05,390 --> 01:22:06,190
I'm one.

2000
01:22:06,190 --> 01:22:06,550
I'm one.

2001
01:22:07,690 --> 01:22:08,650
We're all one.

2002
01:22:08,830 --> 01:22:10,310
I got shot from...

2003
01:22:10,310 --> 01:22:13,590
I didn't see you.

2004
01:22:14,050 --> 01:22:14,510
Oh no.

2005
01:22:14,830 --> 01:22:17,970
There was a flanker.

2006
01:22:22,670 --> 01:22:22,950
No.

2007
01:22:23,270 --> 01:22:26,610
It was a flanker.

2008
01:22:28,830 --> 01:22:31,070
Should we go the right way?

2009
01:22:31,190 --> 01:22:31,730
The same way?

2010
01:22:32,630 --> 01:22:33,370
I don't know.

2011
01:22:34,330 --> 01:22:35,290
I think so.

2012
01:22:35,290 --> 01:22:38,090
We should have one person at least flanking.

2013
01:22:38,110 --> 01:22:40,050
I think we have one person lurk towards mid.

2014
01:22:40,870 --> 01:22:42,350
And then everybody else should go the same way, I think.

2015
01:22:42,910 --> 01:22:43,110
Yeah.

2016
01:22:43,430 --> 01:22:44,690
I think let's go the same way.

2017
01:22:51,010 --> 01:22:51,370
Right?

2018
01:22:51,590 --> 01:22:53,030
I think we go right.

2019
01:22:53,690 --> 01:22:55,490
Doki, can you run right and I'll grab the smoke.

2020
01:22:55,630 --> 01:22:55,990
Yeah, sure.

2021
01:22:56,610 --> 01:22:57,850
This map is so awful.

2022
01:22:58,550 --> 01:22:59,590
This map is hard.

2023
01:23:02,210 --> 01:23:03,530
Sorry, map.

2024
01:23:03,530 --> 01:23:04,530
Oh, I'm not looted.

2025
01:23:05,370 --> 01:23:07,190
One right side.

2026
01:23:07,390 --> 01:23:09,350
Volibear and Kabuto on right.

2027
01:23:10,790 --> 01:23:11,230
Nobody grab the heart.

2028
01:23:11,330 --> 01:23:12,150
I'm grabbing the extra heart.

2029
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:12,350
Hold on.

2030
01:23:13,050 --> 01:23:14,130
Mia has two hearts.

2031
01:23:17,790 --> 01:23:19,150
There's someone over here.

2032
01:23:20,010 --> 01:23:21,390
There's a bear here.

2033
01:23:21,650 --> 01:23:22,530
That box is one on you.

2034
01:23:22,850 --> 01:23:23,170
Yeah.

2035
01:23:24,590 --> 01:23:25,050
Nice.

2036
01:23:26,530 --> 01:23:28,830
What if I go extract right now?

2037
01:23:29,410 --> 01:23:29,890
That would be so sweet.

2038
01:23:33,590 --> 01:23:35,290
Put it on him.

2039
01:23:36,530 --> 01:23:37,190
Nice.

2040
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:38,310
Good work.

2041
01:23:38,430 --> 01:23:39,390
Everyone leave.

2042
01:23:39,930 --> 01:23:41,130
Good shots.

2043
01:23:44,330 --> 01:23:44,990
Yay.

2044
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:46,310
We did it.

2045
01:23:47,910 --> 01:23:48,610
My god.

2046
01:23:48,810 --> 01:23:50,050
That worked pretty well.

2047
01:23:50,810 --> 01:23:51,070
Yeah.

2048
01:23:53,270 --> 01:23:54,850
Oh my god.

2049
01:23:55,070 --> 01:23:55,990
We're just waiting.

2050
01:23:57,430 --> 01:23:58,030
Okay.

2051
01:23:58,230 --> 01:23:59,550
We have one more round.

2052
01:23:59,550 --> 01:24:01,250
Wait, two more rounds.

2053
01:24:01,930 --> 01:24:02,790
Oh my god.

2054
01:24:02,890 --> 01:24:04,330
She just sneaked out.

2055
01:24:06,350 --> 01:24:07,610
Who's still alive?

2056
01:24:08,230 --> 01:24:09,990
It's pink versus orange right now.

2057
01:24:10,230 --> 01:24:10,370
Oh.

2058
01:24:11,470 --> 01:24:12,550
It's a 1v1.

2059
01:24:14,690 --> 01:24:16,650
They're the top performing team.

2060
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:27,840
Right?

2061
01:24:30,620 --> 01:24:31,580
I'm on the far side.

2062
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:32,460
You guys should go right.

2063
01:24:32,460 --> 01:24:34,640
Okay, I'll run for the power up.

2064
01:24:36,940 --> 01:24:38,760
I'm right behind you.

2065
01:24:39,380 --> 01:24:39,960
Haha.

2066
01:24:41,620 --> 01:24:42,600
Shut up.

2067
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:47,220
Oh my god.

2068
01:24:47,540 --> 01:24:48,940
I see him.

2069
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:50,820
They're all in the middle.

2070
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:53,060
We're shooting for you.

2071
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:55,700
I see right under you.

2072
01:24:56,020 --> 01:24:58,600
They literally all went through mid.

2073
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:01,040
I got shot by three different people.

2074
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:02,000
Holy shit.

2075
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:03,480
I'm backing up, SK.

2076
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:05,260
Above you.

2077
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:06,800
There's two of them.

2078
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:09,780
I'm getting the extra heart.

2079
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:10,460
No one got it.

2080
01:25:11,180 --> 01:25:12,180
Radoon's on you.

2081
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:13,640
To your right.

2082
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:15,460
Nice.

2083
01:25:15,940 --> 01:25:16,780
One more above you.

2084
01:25:19,340 --> 01:25:20,400
Radoon's coming from there.

2085
01:25:20,540 --> 01:25:21,340
They're both there.

2086
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:23,180
Nice.

2087
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:24,660
Nice try.

2088
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:27,800
Yeah, you're the last one.

2089
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:29,920
I got shot by three different people.

2090
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:31,160
All random people were spawning and killed me.

2091
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:32,200
I didn't even have time to get away.

2092
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:33,440
That was unfortunate.

2093
01:25:36,780 --> 01:25:37,880
My bad on that one, I guess.

2094
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:43,820
Yeah, I saw one guy and apparently I was in view of three different people.

2095
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:47,080
Yeah, I don't know where we should be going.

2096
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:49,800
I don't know if it's better to play up high and mid or...

2097
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:51,260
How about we all go up high?

2098
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:53,280
We could try all going up high.

2099
01:25:53,340 --> 01:25:54,120
We have one more round to try it.

2100
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:55,380
Yeah, last round.

2101
01:25:55,580 --> 01:25:56,200
Last round.

2102
01:25:57,480 --> 01:25:58,720
We got this.

2103
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:00,840
Oh my god.

2104
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,380
There's a huge gap.

2105
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:05,820
Between fourth and...

2106
01:26:05,820 --> 01:26:07,440
Fourth up and...

2107
01:26:08,340 --> 01:26:09,380
I believe...

2108
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:10,660
I mean...

2109
01:26:11,380 --> 01:26:11,900
Right?

2110
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:13,960
We're going to the right?

2111
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:17,260
I would just go towards the middle and go up high maybe.

2112
01:26:17,540 --> 01:26:19,580
Honestly, there's platforms up high that you can get up right here.

2113
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:23,120
There was.

2114
01:26:23,940 --> 01:26:25,380
I don't see anyone in the middle right now.

2115
01:26:25,660 --> 01:26:26,080
Oh my god.

2116
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:26,760
Got the health up.

2117
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:28,640
There's one left at least.

2118
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:29,960
They're all here.

2119
01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:33,360
I see among us.

2120
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:34,120
I got Bricky.

2121
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:36,780
Among us guys, three hearts.

2122
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:38,660
Purple does four hearts.

2123
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:40,480
What the fuck?

2124
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:42,340
These guys are MLG.

2125
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:44,260
Jesus Christ!

2126
01:26:45,340 --> 01:26:46,480
Wow, they're crazy.

2127
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:48,480
I know, I got shopped.

2128
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:49,940
Back to back to back.

2129
01:26:50,020 --> 01:26:51,840
Yeah, I got sniped.

2130
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:54,880
Where's behind us?

2131
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:55,460
I killed two.

2132
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:57,500
Purple is one.

2133
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:02,860
I got purple.

2134
01:27:03,220 --> 01:27:07,340
I see him.

2135
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:09,700
It's only him left.

2136
01:27:10,420 --> 01:27:11,040
Nice!

2137
01:27:12,170 --> 01:27:14,000
We did it!

2138
01:27:14,020 --> 01:27:14,480
Let's go!

2139
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:16,600
My god.

2140
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:18,280
I locked in.

2141
01:27:20,380 --> 01:27:21,720
Oh my god.

2142
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:22,600
Nice.

2143
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:24,440
Hey, we got fifth.

2144
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:25,360
It's not so bad.

2145
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:25,900
We'll take that.

2146
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:30,340
At the beginning, we struggled a little bit, so...

2147
01:27:30,340 --> 01:27:31,560
We picked it up.

2148
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:33,400
It's just like a rough map.

2149
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:36,280
I think the visibility on this map is so hard.

2150
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:37,360
Because it's...

2151
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:39,380
I think they changed a little.

2152
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:42,180
They changed this map a little because I played it last.

2153
01:27:42,180 --> 01:27:43,120
Last block wars.

2154
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:49,400
Yeah, because last block wars was a lot cleaner.

2155
01:27:50,260 --> 01:27:52,160
To be fair, it was the baby block war.

2156
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:55,880
The baby.

2157
01:27:56,280 --> 01:27:57,560
The baby block war.

2158
01:27:58,020 --> 01:27:58,420
Baby.

2159
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:00,420
Woah.

2160
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:04,180
The gap.

2161
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:04,640
Woah.

2162
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:06,120
It's actually not that bad.

2163
01:28:06,260 --> 01:28:07,860
You can make that up in one round of battle.

2164
01:28:08,220 --> 01:28:08,740
That's...

2165
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:11,300
What if...

2166
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:11,680
What if...

2167
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:13,720
What if we...

2168
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:18,400
What if we get like...

2169
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:19,560
Don't even say that.

2170
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:22,980
Because me and Ant on the same team in battle is diabolical.

2171
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:25,980
But isn't there like...

2172
01:28:25,980 --> 01:28:28,700
I don't know, like five people in a team?

2173
01:28:29,540 --> 01:28:30,540
No, but like...

2174
01:28:30,540 --> 01:28:32,720
I'm saying that because last block wars...

2175
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:35,460
Ant did insane and I did insane.

2176
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:36,840
That's true.

2177
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:41,060
Alright, my standards are gonna be very high now.

2178
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:47,440
I'm gonna have very high standards in battle.

2179
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:49,620
I've never PvP'd in this version before.

2180
01:28:49,980 --> 01:28:50,420
What?

2181
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:51,140
Are you serious?

2182
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:52,980
Yeah.

2183
01:28:53,700 --> 01:28:55,500
Wait, I'm higher ranked than Kumi?

2184
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:57,240
Let's fucking go.

2185
01:28:58,140 --> 01:28:59,240
Make sure you're not sprinting.

2186
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:01,220
You let go of W or else you can't crit.

2187
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:01,820
Do you know what I mean?

2188
01:29:01,820 --> 01:29:02,100
What?

2189
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:04,640
I know what you mean.

2190
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:08,100
Wait, you have to let go of W?

2191
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:10,240
But my brain didn't know that.

2192
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:10,640
Wait.

2193
01:29:12,740 --> 01:29:18,320
Right before you want to get a crit, when you're mid-air, just let go of W for one half second.

2194
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:19,740
That's how you get the crunch.

2195
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:22,680
Instead of the regular hit.

2196
01:29:22,820 --> 01:29:23,180
Does that make sense?

2197
01:29:23,660 --> 01:29:24,060
Yeah.

2198
01:29:27,020 --> 01:29:27,620
Let's go.

2199
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:28,900
Hey, Kumi, check the leaderboard.

2200
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:28,960
Weird.

2201
01:29:32,710 --> 01:29:33,670
Hey, Kumi?

2202
01:29:35,150 --> 01:29:37,970
Let's go to the Sumo arena.

2203
01:29:40,790 --> 01:29:41,670
On the compass.

2204
01:29:44,650 --> 01:29:46,450
Oh, that's the Smash Bros.

2205
01:29:47,910 --> 01:29:48,830
Alright, SK.

2206
01:29:49,310 --> 01:29:49,590
Wait.

2207
01:29:49,950 --> 01:29:52,390
Five minutes?

2208
01:29:53,110 --> 01:29:53,950
There, you got it.

2209
01:29:54,030 --> 01:29:58,630
I didn't actually know that, but my hands do it.

2210
01:29:58,630 --> 01:29:59,810
Which is super weird.

2211
01:30:00,230 --> 01:30:00,830
I bet, yeah.

2212
01:30:00,970 --> 01:30:02,490
That's kind of how it was for me.

2213
01:30:04,250 --> 01:30:04,690
Nice.

2214
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:06,090
Yay.

2215
01:30:07,950 --> 01:30:09,370
Why am I jumping so high?

2216
01:30:09,630 --> 01:30:10,870
Oh, because it's Smash Bros.

2217
01:30:13,830 --> 01:30:15,030
I don't even know.

2218
01:30:19,020 --> 01:30:20,200
What is this?

2219
01:30:21,340 --> 01:30:21,780
Whoa.

2220
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:25,600
Wait, are these real people?

2221
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:26,740
Or are they just bots?

2222
01:30:28,420 --> 01:30:29,200
They're real.

2223
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:30,660
Oh, the staff people are real?

2224
01:30:47,970 --> 01:30:49,010
Can't believe it.

2225
01:30:49,090 --> 01:30:49,790
Four minutes?

2226
01:30:50,110 --> 01:30:51,510
Are they interviewing someone?

2227
01:30:51,550 --> 01:30:52,250
No, they're not.

2228
01:30:52,710 --> 01:30:54,350
They're not interviewing anybody.

2229
01:30:59,370 --> 01:31:02,390
Alright, I muted myself for a little bit.

2230
01:31:02,670 --> 01:31:05,050
I need to fix the volume a little bit.

2231
01:31:05,730 --> 01:31:08,730
Guys, this is so sweaty.

2232
01:31:08,730 --> 01:31:15,890
I think it's like 90% actual full of Minecraft.

2233
01:31:16,250 --> 01:31:19,970
90% Minecraft lobby, I'm pretty sure.

2234
01:31:20,610 --> 01:31:22,170
Why am I here?

2235
01:31:23,790 --> 01:31:25,830
I'd never say no.

2236
01:31:30,850 --> 01:31:33,690
Yeah, this is very sweaty.

2237
01:31:38,730 --> 01:31:40,470
I cannot say no.

2238
01:31:44,540 --> 01:31:46,830
Let's see who I'm better than.

2239
01:31:49,190 --> 01:31:50,190
Oh, guys.

2240
01:31:54,570 --> 01:31:55,050
No!

2241
01:31:58,830 --> 01:32:03,370
Wait, no, that's last game leaderboard.

2242
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:05,750
Okay, but look at this.

2243
01:32:07,230 --> 01:32:10,190
You might be better than me at last game.

2244
01:32:10,630 --> 01:32:17,470
But in the overall leaderboard, I'm still up there.

2245
01:32:22,030 --> 01:32:23,510
It's fine.

2246
01:32:24,990 --> 01:32:25,590
Oh, no.

2247
01:32:26,010 --> 01:32:26,730
Race is scary.

2248
01:32:27,270 --> 01:32:27,890
Race is worse.

2249
01:32:29,330 --> 01:32:32,730
Race is where we might have forgot how to play.

2250
01:32:33,530 --> 01:32:34,670
Let's go.

2251
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:38,390
Wait, what's his tournament earnings in Minecraft?

2252
01:32:39,470 --> 01:32:40,690
Do Minecrafters win money?

2253
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:43,870
I feel like they just make so much money in general.

2254
01:32:44,030 --> 01:32:46,190
I don't even know if they make money.

2255
01:32:46,950 --> 01:32:48,190
Tournament earning.

2256
01:32:49,390 --> 01:32:50,030
Oh, shit.

2257
01:32:52,150 --> 01:32:53,350
Esport earnings.

2258
01:32:55,550 --> 01:32:58,730
9,400 from 7 tournaments.

2259
01:32:58,730 --> 01:33:02,410
Alright, guys.

2260
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:03,590
Alright, guys.

2261
01:33:04,270 --> 01:33:07,150
He has 9.7k from tournament earnings alone.

2262
01:33:09,130 --> 01:33:11,870
I got that Liquid PD I pulled out.

2263
01:33:14,230 --> 01:33:15,790
That was a weird way.

2264
01:33:16,270 --> 01:33:22,930
Minecraft streamers make so much money overall just from like content creation.

2265
01:33:23,370 --> 01:33:28,230
I'm just like wondering do they have tournaments with like winners?

2266
01:33:28,610 --> 01:33:30,330
To be fair, I did play the Haunted House.

2267
01:33:30,770 --> 01:33:31,170
OrisaBongo?

2268
01:33:31,630 --> 01:33:34,190
Two or three shot people, essentially.

2269
01:33:34,550 --> 01:33:36,850
It's like giving your whole team like Ana ult, essentially.

2270
01:33:37,490 --> 01:33:38,910
If they're within the range of it.

2271
01:33:39,310 --> 01:33:42,090
Yeah, and they respawn so like your power up.

2272
01:33:42,150 --> 01:33:46,910
So you should do it at our very first fight and then like the next fight that you have it.

2273
01:33:47,670 --> 01:33:48,990
They're all like one shot though.

2274
01:33:49,070 --> 01:33:53,330
So you have to like put them in spots where it's hard to shoot them or kill them.

2275
01:33:53,490 --> 01:33:54,370
Do they go through walls?

2276
01:33:55,270 --> 01:33:56,310
Yeah, it'll do it.

2277
01:33:56,590 --> 01:33:58,850
It's just children spend a lot of money.

2278
01:33:58,970 --> 01:34:00,710
There's like a 5 or 6 bucks radius around it.

2279
01:34:00,730 --> 01:34:06,190
Children market is like the most, one of the most lucrative market out there.

2280
01:34:06,290 --> 01:34:07,790
It's not actually fighting people.

2281
01:34:07,910 --> 01:34:09,430
It's having really, really good positioning.

2282
01:34:09,670 --> 01:34:12,130
So you're a team that makes it to the very, very end of the game.

2283
01:34:12,310 --> 01:34:13,150
Look at Ryan's world.

2284
01:34:13,910 --> 01:34:16,270
Most of the time I'm just going to be like, guys, follow me, follow me.

2285
01:34:16,330 --> 01:34:20,830
Because I'm always going to like try and put us in a position where we're not right next to a team.

2286
01:34:20,870 --> 01:34:22,610
Oh, Battle Royale, we're playing Apex Legends.

2287
01:34:22,610 --> 01:34:24,870
Yeah, essentially, yeah.

2288
01:34:25,330 --> 01:34:27,670
I think I was watching a video.

2289
01:34:28,490 --> 01:34:30,010
I should listen to this.

2290
01:34:31,110 --> 01:34:32,290
I should listen to this.

2291
01:34:32,890 --> 01:34:36,490
We'll have an easy way to get a good position.

2292
01:34:36,610 --> 01:34:37,250
But yeah, just follow me.

2293
01:34:37,310 --> 01:34:38,690
Try and hold hands and stay together.

2294
01:34:38,830 --> 01:34:39,470
Try not to run off.

2295
01:34:39,930 --> 01:34:45,770
The only time I've ever run off was to go and kill Fruit Berries because I was... and I paid the price for it.

2296
01:34:45,870 --> 01:34:47,170
So I will never do that again.

2297
01:34:47,310 --> 01:34:57,610
I was watching a video about Ryan's world, and like he made $30 million in a year.

2298
01:34:58,030 --> 01:35:00,310
Within like this last year.

2299
01:35:00,710 --> 01:35:06,770
He's made $30 million within last year profit-wise, which is...

2300
01:35:06,770 --> 01:35:07,590
Oh, yeah.

2301
01:35:08,590 --> 01:35:10,130
How many numbers?

2302
01:35:12,530 --> 01:35:14,830
Isn't that fucking insane?

2303
01:35:15,770 --> 01:35:18,110
Yeah, because it's like...

2304
01:35:18,110 --> 01:35:23,370
He merchandises hard now, so he has like lots of toys and stuff.

2305
01:35:23,870 --> 01:35:28,030
And kids are like...

2306
01:35:28,030 --> 01:35:36,170
Because parents will buy stuff for their children no matter the price because they're like, we want to make our children happy and stuff.

2307
01:35:36,650 --> 01:35:37,970
So, what is his content?

2308
01:35:38,210 --> 01:35:44,610
He basically does like toy unboxing and stuff, and he's like 14 now, right?

2309
01:35:44,910 --> 01:35:49,670
So people right now, the biggest controversy is that people are like wondering

2310
01:35:53,490 --> 01:35:54,090
if...

2311
01:35:54,090 --> 01:36:04,270
People are like wondering if he's like too old for this now because his content is entirely for kids, but like they're like, are his parents forcing him and shit like that?

2312
01:36:04,590 --> 01:36:06,890
Is he 14 or 13 or younger?

2313
01:36:07,830 --> 01:36:08,430
Wait...

2314
01:36:08,430 --> 01:36:09,530
How old is Ryan?

2315
01:36:09,770 --> 01:36:11,930
I know he's like a tween right now.

2316
01:36:15,370 --> 01:36:17,170
I know he's like a tween.

2317
01:36:17,690 --> 01:36:18,870
Wait, which currency?

2318
01:36:20,110 --> 01:36:22,070
Uh, the hourglasses.

2319
01:36:22,190 --> 01:36:22,530
Oh!

2320
01:36:24,130 --> 01:36:25,270
I was close.

2321
01:36:26,730 --> 01:36:30,470
They just refreshed the shop too, so you can buy like, they have like the monthly...

2322
01:36:30,470 --> 01:36:32,010
Yeah, I bought out the monthly ones already.

2323
01:36:32,610 --> 01:36:39,270
But yeah, like, that's what people are talking about right now because like, they're like wondering if it's like oh shit, Ryan retired?

2324
01:36:40,230 --> 01:36:43,390
Because like, is he actually doing that because he enjoyed it?

2325
01:36:43,390 --> 01:36:48,090
Or like, is he doing it because his parents are making him?

2326
01:36:48,570 --> 01:36:51,410
Because I mean 30 million dollars in a year?

2327
01:36:51,810 --> 01:36:52,870
That's insane!

2328
01:36:53,930 --> 01:37:16,450
And like, and like, his channel they don't even use they don't even use his like, his like newer content, because like more children watch his videos when he's younger so they purposely reuse his older content and it works like 30% of the time they reuse his older content to like,

2329
01:37:16,450 --> 01:37:19,730
entice children to watch the videos more.

2330
01:37:20,410 --> 01:37:43,310
Because like, they don't click on the content where he's like obviously 12 years old versus like, you know 5 I don't think so Because like, people who are 12 don't watch Ryan's world anymore like the audience that grew up with him will not be watching his channel now Yeah,

2331
01:37:43,310 --> 01:37:51,510
basically, they already grew up grew out of it, so like, he has to like he has to like, attract the newer children

2332
01:37:56,250 --> 01:37:57,350
Event paused?

2333
01:37:57,490 --> 01:37:58,430
What are we pausing for?

2334
01:37:59,630 --> 01:38:05,650
Every time I I always look at the interview channel They do!

2335
01:38:05,830 --> 01:38:14,130
They have, they have he has two younger sisters Oh shit Wait, what?

2336
01:38:14,790 --> 01:38:19,150
Sorry, I was talking about Ryan's world in my chat The toy review?

2337
01:38:19,490 --> 01:38:32,450
Yeah, yeah, the toy review You know, he made like 30 million dollars last year For sure Yeah, I was watching a video about him Cause like, right now they're like, trying to be like, should Ryan retire?

2338
01:38:32,650 --> 01:38:42,880
Cause he's like 12 now So it's like I've seen so many posts about that Yeah, yeah, cause he's like Cause they're like, wondering like, does he actually wanna do it?

2339
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:53,600
Cause his content is like, entirely like, geared towards like children, cause the audience he grew up with outgrew his content So like, they're like, wondering like oh, should Ryan actually retire?

2340
01:38:53,780 --> 01:38:56,160
Because like does he actually still wanna do it?

2341
01:38:56,840 --> 01:39:20,440
Retiring at 12 is crazy Yeah, retiring at 12, I mean he made 30 million dollars last year Like Just from one year alone Like he's set for fucking life if he invests it Yeah, sometimes like I don't know I heard his like, mum or his parents, like keep making him do it,

2342
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:39,360
but like bro, he's he's literally a teenager now, like no one wants to watch him review toys or anything Yeah, yeah, like toys that are like for like, like 5 and under Yeah I know, but sometimes it's like never enough, like you know what I mean Like when you,

2343
01:39:39,480 --> 01:40:00,360
probably when you make that much money it's probably never enough for them They wanna get more and more They're just like, they're accustomed to the lifestyle type, yeah Yeah, cause I was like watching it, and I thought he was like like, but like, and he's like he has like multiple like sponsors and like brand deals and stuff like that,

2344
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:06,500
like like merchandising and things It's actually crazy how, like I didn't even know he had a Nickelodeon show Really?

2345
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:13,200

Wait, no, I don't wanna go to the hard path No

2380
01:46:56,570 --> 01:46:58,210
What if we just skip that next lap

2381
01:47:05,070 --> 01:47:05,830
Hey Tubbo

2382
01:47:10,480 --> 01:47:12,740

nevermind

2385
01:47:53,910 --> 01:47:57,150
And how are they moving so fast That's so hard, that's actually so hard

2386
01:48:06,910 --> 01:48:13,710
The way that hard path was barely worth it, by the way I don't understand how people move so fast

2387
01:48:17,450 --> 01:48:18,730
Oh, that's how

2388
01:48:31,510 --> 01:48:32,430

01:48:32,910 --> 01:48:35,810
Oh Okay

2390
01:48:39,210 --> 01:48:44,290
I realized I could've just ran I actually made myself slower by jumping

2391
01:48:48,410 --> 01:48:51,570
That makes sense how I got lapped there

2392
01:49:03,290 --> 01:49:05,630
Things make so much more sense now

2393
01:49:39,380 --> 01:50:18,920

2449
02:02:49,020 --> 02:03:00,600
Oh my god Oh my god, we have to have everyone's chats vote party Oh, it ended Okay, I'll be right back Wait,

2450
02:03:04,920 --> 02:03:06,020
I'll be right back

2451
02:03:11,560 --> 02:03:16,280
Party won What happened?

2452
02:03:16,920 --> 02:03:19,880
That's so embarrassing What happened?

2453
02:03:20,520 --> 02:03:40,820
I went to go look for the poll And I was looking for it everywhere I looked on Twitter, I looked on Twitch, I looked everywhere And it's on the screen Nice And then you have a poll And I bet like ten people probably voted in that There's no way I don't even know Oh,

2454
02:03:40,900 --> 02:03:53,120
I think we're doing party Oh, party, let's go That was ridiculous Let's get sleepy We gotta get sleepy in our team now I'm here now, I'm here I'm here

2455
02:03:57,840 --> 02:04:00,120
The whole gang is here

2456
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:05,120
We should be here

2457
02:04:16,710 --> 02:04:19,590
I need Sneak to come here Where are we missing?

2458
02:04:19,650 --> 02:04:20,310
Where's Eggman?

2459
02:04:20,510 --> 02:04:22,030
Where's our Dr. Eggman?

2460
02:04:22,910 --> 02:04:24,930
He's coming, I need...

2461
02:04:24,930 --> 02:04:25,730
Sneak

2462
02:04:30,430 --> 02:04:35,990
Nice We request a new team Mods

2463
02:04:40,510 --> 02:04:41,850
They're gonna do it

2464
02:04:47,270 --> 02:04:49,790
What the hell does Amy even say, bro?

2465
02:04:50,110 --> 02:04:51,270
He's like...

2466
02:04:51,270 --> 02:04:54,930
You're just here to chase after Sonic You're his girlfriend

2467
02:05:06,110 --> 02:05:10,250
Asterisk blocks Eggman with my hands

2468
02:05:27,020 --> 02:05:32,420
I love roleplaying I love roleplaying What do you mean?

2469
02:05:33,020 --> 02:05:37,020
I love roleplaying Alright, are you guys ready for party?

2470
02:05:38,240 --> 02:05:42,140
Yippee I love this game, it's so much fun Which one are we doing first?

2471
02:05:42,720 --> 02:05:43,140
Party

2472
02:05:46,580 --> 02:05:50,540
Oh my god It's loading Do you know the paintball game?

2473
02:05:52,280 --> 02:06:01,100
I'm writing a really long roleplay right now Kills are good Getting the roof and ceiling is really good Roof and ceiling?

2474
02:06:01,220 --> 02:06:01,680
That's a thing?

2475
02:06:02,320 --> 02:06:06,880
Yeah, sometimes there are blocks above Hey guys Do you like planes?

2476
02:06:15,180 --> 02:06:23,060
Oh my god guys, we can run into the void Wait, come here I'll see you on the other side

2477
02:06:28,740 --> 02:06:31,940
Why are we roleplaying in the chat?

2478
02:06:32,240 --> 02:06:58,940
Guys, I just invented a new technology It's called a cell phone It can have games I don't know how to do a triple neo You have to go to the corner like this This just makes me upset You go to the corner, you have to aim right here And you have to run for like a slight second And then just full send it around

2479
02:07:04,320 --> 02:07:06,340
I've never learned this before

2480
02:07:10,920 --> 02:07:14,740
How do you see my shadow?

2481
02:07:16,060 --> 02:07:19,180
This is terrible You think this is allowed?

2482
02:07:22,640 --> 02:08:10,660
I can't do it I just can't do it I'm not even going to try I'll try one more You don't want to move your mouse until you're around the block Essentially Dude, I think I'm doing it to the seat You're going to double jump And then you move your head You move your head after you're around And you want to turn in This is horrible All you're going to do is run for a slight second And then you You just hold spacebar You don't have to time your jumps or anything Just hold spacebar and send it This is horrible I don't want to do that again I can't even do a double Oh my god I'm watching this You can do a single and a double I believe in you Hurry,

2483
02:08:11,780 --> 02:08:12,900
Tails Join the tree

2484
02:08:29,460 --> 02:08:37,440
This is the real content Yeah, buddy We're Shadow and Doctor We've got to make the full train

2485
02:08:41,500 --> 02:08:47,260
Join the tree That was rough

2486
02:08:50,620 --> 02:08:54,780
I don't think Shadow wants to join Shadow just wants to play Shadow's dad

2487
02:09:00,500 --> 02:09:08,880
I'm getting a little bit freaked out I will find the chaos hammer

2488
02:09:21,360 --> 02:09:23,560
That was fast

2489
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:27,500
Nice!

2490
02:09:28,780 --> 02:09:28,980
Splat!

2491
02:09:33,220 --> 02:09:37,240
Wait, bandit, Dr. Eggman's missing one player.

2492
02:09:41,860 --> 02:09:45,220
Yeah, I think generally, I mean, we don't like fully split up.

2493
02:09:45,280 --> 02:09:48,540
I think like we just try and claim like maybe one directional corner maybe.

2494
02:09:48,840 --> 02:09:51,300
Maybe we can like be like southwest or something.

2495
02:09:51,400 --> 02:09:51,820
Does that make sense?

2496
02:09:52,040 --> 02:09:53,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2497
02:09:54,560 --> 02:09:58,100
I think working towards the middle is good as well and you can get kills.

2498
02:09:58,440 --> 02:10:00,660
Yeah, because I think people are going to forget about middle.

2499
02:10:02,480 --> 02:10:03,420
Yeah, I agree.

2500
02:10:03,500 --> 02:10:04,940
And kills are worth a lot too, so.

2501
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:07,040
Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna kill.

2502
02:10:07,260 --> 02:10:10,120
You can throw a little bomb and it'll cover the whole area with your color.

2503
02:10:10,240 --> 02:10:10,640
Whoa!

2504
02:10:10,920 --> 02:10:14,640
Yeah, so SK, to like reload your gun when it's out, you just shift on your own color.

2505
02:10:14,780 --> 02:10:16,080
It's like Splatoon, SK!

2506
02:10:16,300 --> 02:10:16,640
It's literally Splatoon.

2507
02:10:16,640 --> 02:10:17,360
It's like Splatoon!

2508
02:10:18,040 --> 02:10:19,640
Okay, we want more land?

2509
02:10:20,220 --> 02:10:21,280
Yeah, as much as possible.

2510
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:23,840
I got northeast.

2511
02:10:26,240 --> 02:10:27,100
I'm in northeast.

2512
02:10:28,620 --> 02:10:31,060
I think we should all try and do southwest.

2513
02:10:32,360 --> 02:10:32,660
Okay.

2514
02:10:33,380 --> 02:10:34,820
Yeah, there's already really southwest right now.

2515
02:10:35,360 --> 02:10:37,260
I mean, we can split up if we want, I would just say.

2516
02:10:37,600 --> 02:10:38,400
Just go north-south.

2517
02:10:38,600 --> 02:10:38,980
Okay, I'm done.

2518
02:10:39,560 --> 02:10:40,400
And we have three people.

2519
02:10:40,400 --> 02:10:42,500
No, Ant, maybe three of us start southwest.

2520
02:10:42,540 --> 02:10:43,100
I'll go middle.

2521
02:10:43,100 --> 02:10:43,440
I'll go middle.

2522
02:10:43,440 --> 02:10:43,920
I'll go middle, Ant.

2523
02:10:43,940 --> 02:10:44,820
Because no one's in southwest.

2524
02:10:45,140 --> 02:10:45,900
Like, no one's around here.

2525
02:10:45,900 --> 02:10:46,420
Okay, we can split.

2526
02:10:46,440 --> 02:10:46,960
We can split if you want.

2527
02:10:46,960 --> 02:10:47,660
Except for purple.

2528
02:10:48,780 --> 02:10:50,060
Northeast time, let's go.

2529
02:10:50,060 --> 02:10:50,640
Let's go purple.

2530
02:10:50,720 --> 02:10:51,360
Let's go purple.

2531
02:10:51,360 --> 02:10:51,980
Straight down.

2532
02:10:52,300 --> 02:10:53,780
You can't kill your own teammates.

2533
02:10:53,920 --> 02:10:55,420
There's no team damage.

2534
02:10:57,880 --> 02:10:59,260
What the fuck?

2535
02:10:59,620 --> 02:11:01,100
Bro, I got like instant...

2536
02:11:01,100 --> 02:11:02,800
I got instant red.

2537
02:11:02,940 --> 02:11:03,740
It started?

2538
02:11:04,120 --> 02:11:04,440
Yeah.

2539
02:11:06,100 --> 02:11:06,720
Lock in.

2540
02:11:06,820 --> 02:11:07,160
Lock in.

2541
02:11:09,580 --> 02:11:10,820
How is that not killing?

2542
02:11:11,980 --> 02:11:13,280
Oh my god.

2543
02:11:15,380 --> 02:11:17,120
Oh, nice.

2544
02:11:17,140 --> 02:11:17,820
I got it.

2545
02:11:20,540 --> 02:11:22,460
Get him, Antfrost, behind you.

2546
02:11:23,300 --> 02:11:24,520
Oh, I'm on the top of a building.

2547
02:11:24,660 --> 02:11:25,180
That's OP.

2548
02:11:29,420 --> 02:11:30,980
The movement is so weird in this.

2549
02:11:31,040 --> 02:11:33,260
I feel like you can't do the tech use ability before.

2550
02:11:35,520 --> 02:11:37,940
Yellow has a whole corner to themselves and nobody's going for them.

2551
02:11:38,420 --> 02:11:42,000
Okay, let's try and figure out any corners that aren't taken, maybe.

2552
02:11:42,600 --> 02:11:43,400
Fruit berries!

2553
02:11:44,420 --> 02:11:47,260
Purple is getting all the roofs and it's very effective.

2554
02:11:47,860 --> 02:11:48,700
Yeah, I know.

2555
02:11:48,800 --> 02:11:50,560
I think it's a good shot getting on the roof if you can.

2556
02:11:51,080 --> 02:11:53,740
Try and get any corners that you guys see, like, unused.

2557
02:11:56,340 --> 02:12:00,360
Oh, you can get stairs.

2558
02:12:00,500 --> 02:12:01,060
I just noticed.

2559
02:12:02,060 --> 02:12:04,940
Yeah, like, if you're scared you're gonna, like, die, just go in a corner.

2560
02:12:17,590 --> 02:12:19,250
No, Fruit's just on me from behind.

2561
02:12:19,810 --> 02:12:20,510
You just can't?

2562
02:12:30,330 --> 02:12:31,650
Oh, guys, we're running out of time.

2563
02:12:32,530 --> 02:12:33,710
Whoa, there's a...

2564
02:12:38,150 --> 02:12:38,630
Oh, a bomb?

2565
02:12:38,870 --> 02:12:40,830
Oh, if you guys have a bomb, make sure to place it.

2566
02:12:41,730 --> 02:12:43,330
I honestly don't have a bomb.

2567
02:12:48,700 --> 02:12:49,940
No, Eggman, no!

2568
02:12:51,640 --> 02:12:52,780
Keep going, guys, keep going.

2569
02:12:52,940 --> 02:12:53,760
Lock in, lock in.

2570
02:12:55,140 --> 02:12:56,360
We're doing really good, we're doing good, we're doing good.

2571
02:13:01,560 --> 02:13:02,600
Purple was one?

2572
02:13:02,800 --> 02:13:03,020
I'm just kidding.

2573
02:13:03,180 --> 02:13:06,080
Oh my god, like, why are two oranges just running around together?

2574
02:13:12,270 --> 02:13:13,070
Oh, no.

2575
02:13:13,830 --> 02:13:15,290
I don't know how I'm getting killed there.

2576
02:13:15,890 --> 02:13:16,290
Okay,

2577
02:13:20,130 --> 02:13:21,310
lock in, guys, not much time.

2578
02:13:21,610 --> 02:13:23,010
Just get as many colors as you can.

2579
02:13:23,830 --> 02:13:24,550
Hey, we got stairs!

2580
02:13:24,830 --> 02:13:26,070
We did good, we did good, we did good.

2581
02:13:26,490 --> 02:13:26,890
Nice.

2582
02:13:27,470 --> 02:13:27,790
Nice!

2583
02:13:28,710 --> 02:13:30,170
I took over a corner.

2584
02:13:31,170 --> 02:13:31,950
We got stairs!

2585
02:13:32,110 --> 02:13:32,310
Yeah!

2586
02:13:32,830 --> 02:13:34,310
Oh my god, let's go!

2587
02:13:35,090 --> 02:13:36,150
That was really good.

2588
02:13:36,290 --> 02:13:38,350
Oh, wow, nice, let's go.

2589
02:13:43,110 --> 02:13:44,250
Let's go, guys.

2590
02:13:46,290 --> 02:13:46,850
5600 blocks?

2591
02:13:47,650 --> 02:13:48,210
What the?

2592
02:13:49,170 --> 02:13:50,270
That's a lot of blocks.

2593
02:13:50,390 --> 02:13:51,710
Yeah, that's a lot of blockies.

2594
02:13:54,790 --> 02:13:56,630
I kind of like that version of the game a lot better.

2595
02:13:56,810 --> 02:13:57,310
Oh, go down.

2596
02:13:58,310 --> 02:13:58,650
What's this?

2597
02:13:58,970 --> 02:14:02,070
This is literally just trying to go down as fast as possible without dying.

2598
02:14:02,190 --> 02:14:04,170
You just want to go from block to block, there's power-ups.

2599
02:14:04,370 --> 02:14:05,770
You don't get points until you hit it, like...

2600
02:14:05,770 --> 02:14:06,470
Wait, without dying?

2601
02:14:07,110 --> 02:14:07,710
Yeah, without dying.

2602
02:14:07,870 --> 02:14:09,910
It's like dropper, but you just want to go from things.

2603
02:14:09,910 --> 02:14:10,470
Punching?

2604
02:14:10,570 --> 02:14:12,630
You can get kills, but they're worth literally no points.

2605
02:14:12,670 --> 02:14:14,150
They're worth like one point per kill or something.

2606
02:14:16,130 --> 02:14:18,910
The platforms are like power-ups and buffs that you can get.

2607
02:14:21,150 --> 02:14:23,470
Red is weapons, blue is items, and green is regen.

2608
02:14:23,770 --> 02:14:26,590
So go to green if you need healing, but just try to work your way down as fast as you can, essentially.

2609
02:14:27,130 --> 02:14:29,710
Yeah, but you don't get points unless you hit the platform thing.

2610
02:14:29,930 --> 02:14:32,890
So you have to make sure you hit it.

2611
02:14:33,990 --> 02:14:34,310
Whoa!

2612
02:14:34,810 --> 02:14:35,430
I died.

2613
02:14:36,670 --> 02:14:37,310
I missed.

2614
02:14:37,310 --> 02:14:38,410
He griefed mine, that's lovely.

2615
02:14:39,330 --> 02:14:40,330
Yeah, he griefed others.

2616
02:14:41,310 --> 02:14:42,330
That's the best part.

2617
02:14:43,050 --> 02:14:43,670
Like, why?

2618
02:14:43,770 --> 02:14:44,490
Somebody just...

2619
02:14:44,490 --> 02:14:46,230
Okay, I was being followed and punched.

2620
02:14:46,370 --> 02:14:47,490
That's chill, actually.

2621
02:14:50,270 --> 02:14:51,370
Is green not regen?

2622
02:14:51,690 --> 02:14:52,350
What's going on?

2623
02:14:52,450 --> 02:14:53,470
Green is regen.

2624
02:14:53,930 --> 02:14:55,370
I'm not really getting regen, okay.

2625
02:14:58,930 --> 02:14:59,330
Like...

2626
02:15:00,070 --> 02:15:00,870
I don't know.

2627
02:15:00,950 --> 02:15:02,450
I wasn't really getting regen on green, so I don't know.

2628
02:15:02,530 --> 02:15:03,370
I'm not really sure.

2629
02:15:03,450 --> 02:15:03,790
I'm confused.

2630
02:15:03,790 --> 02:15:04,810
Oh, it's really slow.

2631
02:15:05,830 --> 02:15:07,610
Oh man, that sucks for him.

2632
02:15:14,410 --> 02:15:15,630
Man, that's unfortunate.

2633
02:15:17,510 --> 02:15:18,050
What's blue?

2634
02:15:18,130 --> 02:15:20,610
I think you reach a checkpoint once you reach the glass area.

2635
02:15:22,430 --> 02:15:22,870
Oh, oh.

2636
02:15:25,070 --> 02:15:25,730
Oh, I died.

2637
02:15:27,490 --> 02:15:29,790
Oh, if you die, do you go...

2638
02:15:32,820 --> 02:15:34,040
It doesn't matter if you die, Anne.

2639
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:36,220
Did you just go to your checkpoint?

2640
02:15:36,420 --> 02:15:37,440
Not necessarily, but...

2641
02:15:38,820 --> 02:15:39,620
Yeah, I just go to the last checkpoint.

2642
02:15:47,430 --> 02:15:47,750
No.

2643
02:15:48,770 --> 02:15:49,090
No!

2644
02:15:51,770 --> 02:15:52,970
I couldn't see it.

2645
02:15:53,070 --> 02:15:54,310
It was so hard to see.

2646
02:15:54,570 --> 02:15:55,390
Oh, there's laps.

2647
02:15:55,530 --> 02:15:55,990
Oh my god.

2648
02:15:56,990 --> 02:15:59,530
Yeah, there's laps.

2649
02:15:59,610 --> 02:16:01,010
If you get down one, you can go down again.

2650
02:16:03,310 --> 02:16:05,250
This pathing on the pink is hard, I'm not gonna lie.

2651
02:16:05,250 --> 02:16:08,330
Yeah, I got, like, fucked up by the colors.

2652
02:16:13,460 --> 02:16:13,860
Fuck!

2653
02:16:14,820 --> 02:16:16,340
Wait, I think I might die for this, yeah.

2654
02:16:16,700 --> 02:16:18,020
I'm just getting killed, sorry.

2655
02:16:18,960 --> 02:16:19,380
No, you're fine.

2656
02:16:20,740 --> 02:16:21,140
Oh!

2657
02:16:22,240 --> 02:16:23,000
Fuck you!

2658
02:16:23,620 --> 02:16:24,020
Doki!

2659
02:16:25,500 --> 02:16:26,100
Kill him!

2660
02:16:28,360 --> 02:16:29,560
I killed him for it.

2661
02:16:30,780 --> 02:16:32,680
Oh my god, I can't tell where I am.

2662
02:16:32,760 --> 02:16:33,860
The pink is so hard.

2663
02:16:34,280 --> 02:16:35,100
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

2664
02:16:35,100 --> 02:16:36,020
The pink one is hard.

2665
02:16:37,500 --> 02:16:38,280
Yeah, I couldn't tell.

2666
02:16:39,200 --> 02:16:41,260
It was incredibly difficult to see.

2667
02:16:41,360 --> 02:16:41,660
Do I die?

2668
02:16:41,980 --> 02:16:45,100
I literally almost got there, and then I, uh...

2669
02:16:45,880 --> 02:16:46,260
Okay?

2670
02:16:47,300 --> 02:16:47,660
Oh.

2671
02:16:47,840 --> 02:16:51,100
This game is, like, how am I supposed to make it to the bottom when that's a jump?

2672
02:16:51,680 --> 02:16:52,600
Yeah, be strong, that's what you get.

2673
02:16:52,760 --> 02:16:53,060
You don't.

2674
02:16:56,400 --> 02:16:57,200
You don't.

2675
02:17:01,220 --> 02:17:02,360
Okay, I'm sorry.

2676
02:17:02,880 --> 02:17:05,320
I got one lap, that's hard, I don't know, that's hard.

2677
02:17:05,900 --> 02:17:10,740
This game is flawed because, like, you can't fall from a bridge to the bottom.

2678
02:17:10,760 --> 02:17:10,760
Esken!

2679
02:17:10,760 --> 02:17:11,640
Esken, look at you!

2680
02:17:11,660 --> 02:17:12,200
Let's go, Esken.

2681
02:17:13,020 --> 02:17:13,480
Let's go.

2682
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:34,500
Oh, we got beaten.

2683
02:17:34,500 --> 02:17:34,580
We got beaten.

2684
02:17:41,740 --> 02:17:42,060
Um...

2685
02:17:45,460 --> 02:17:46,440
So this is parkour.

2686
02:17:46,540 --> 02:17:47,420
You just go back and forth.

2687
02:17:48,240 --> 02:17:49,600
And you need to do it in time.

2688
02:17:50,160 --> 02:17:51,280
Wait, what is this?

2689
02:17:53,220 --> 02:17:55,200
So you go back and forth doing parkour.

2690
02:17:56,180 --> 02:17:56,820
Each stage.

2691
02:17:56,940 --> 02:17:58,540
There's, like, a challenge side and a normal side.

2692
02:17:58,640 --> 02:17:59,340
I would do the...

2693
02:17:59,340 --> 02:18:01,780
Wait, which is the normal side?

2694
02:18:02,340 --> 02:18:03,860
Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.

2695
02:18:04,900 --> 02:18:05,940
Oh, how do I get in?

2696
02:18:05,940 --> 02:18:07,540
Wait, is the orange on the challenge side?

2697
02:18:07,780 --> 02:18:08,120
It's the inventory.

2698
02:18:09,560 --> 02:18:10,680
Blue is normal side.

2699
02:18:12,160 --> 02:18:12,380
Yeah.

2700
02:18:13,540 --> 02:18:14,220
Wait, what?

2701
02:18:15,780 --> 02:18:17,240
And then you just do it back and forth?

2702
02:18:18,460 --> 02:18:20,860
No, no, so you keep running back and forth through the parkour.

2703
02:18:21,400 --> 02:18:22,580
Wait, I can't get out of it.

2704
02:18:22,600 --> 02:18:23,480
You can't go back.

2705
02:18:23,500 --> 02:18:24,860
No, you have to wait for the next one.

2706
02:18:25,320 --> 02:18:25,660
Oh!

2707
02:18:30,600 --> 02:18:31,600
Oh, wait, what?

2708
02:18:32,420 --> 02:18:33,100
I'm confused.

2709
02:18:33,480 --> 02:18:35,280
You just have to wait for the next map to spawn.

2710
02:18:36,080 --> 02:18:37,240
The side thing is...

2711
02:18:37,240 --> 02:18:39,140
Do the normal side if you're not confident in parkour.

2712
02:18:39,240 --> 02:18:41,980
Only do the hard side if you're, like, confident in doing parkour well.

2713
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:45,340
Okay, I get it now, I get it.

2714
02:18:50,750 --> 02:18:51,890
Why is she doing over here?

2715
02:18:53,810 --> 02:18:54,850
What is this?

2716
02:18:59,660 --> 02:19:00,020
Okay.

2717
02:19:02,700 --> 02:19:03,980
Asuka, did you switch to our side?

2718
02:19:04,520 --> 02:19:04,880
Yeah.

2719
02:19:05,300 --> 02:19:06,420
Hana, are you on the normal side or challenge?

2720
02:19:08,100 --> 02:19:08,540
Challenge.

2721
02:19:09,080 --> 02:19:09,580
Challenge, challenge.

2722
02:19:10,540 --> 02:19:10,980
What?

2723
02:19:12,440 --> 02:19:13,420
No, I wasn't sure.

2724
02:19:15,080 --> 02:19:15,640
Oh, okay.

2725
02:19:19,750 --> 02:19:21,390
That was good handling.

2726
02:19:22,210 --> 02:19:22,810
You're cooking.

2727
02:19:30,890 --> 02:19:31,330
Yay!

2728
02:19:32,110 --> 02:19:33,010
Alright, keep it up, guys.

2729
02:19:34,210 --> 02:19:35,030
This is scary.

2730
02:19:35,210 --> 02:19:37,350
Asuka, if you have one life, maybe go to easy.

2731
02:19:38,030 --> 02:19:39,190
Okay, I'm still in full.

2732
02:19:40,090 --> 02:19:40,930
Other than that one.

2733
02:19:41,550 --> 02:19:42,190
Got you.

2734
02:19:42,290 --> 02:19:42,690
I fell.

2735
02:19:43,770 --> 02:19:45,670
I'm a bit confused for this one.

2736
02:19:45,790 --> 02:19:46,430
Oh, I fell too.

2737
02:19:49,770 --> 02:19:51,330
I'm risking it for the biscuit.

2738
02:19:51,710 --> 02:19:52,350
Okay, okay.

2739
02:19:53,190 --> 02:19:58,950
If you fall on the challenge side, you can also go back to normal as well.

2740
02:19:59,850 --> 02:20:00,750
I think you could do it.

2741
02:20:01,590 --> 02:20:01,930
Yay!

2742
02:20:02,430 --> 02:20:04,270
Honestly, that's not what you're comfortable with.

2743
02:20:05,010 --> 02:20:05,350
Yep.

2744
02:20:10,170 --> 02:20:11,470
Oh, I messed up.

2745
02:20:11,470 --> 02:20:12,650
I didn't realize there's a lower block.

2746
02:20:12,770 --> 02:20:13,690
Oh, that's so bad.

2747
02:20:14,770 --> 02:20:16,190
Okay, I fell.

2748
02:20:16,310 --> 02:20:17,090
Ant, should I go over?

2749
02:20:17,270 --> 02:20:17,730
Back to easy?

2750
02:20:17,790 --> 02:20:20,470
No, I have one life.

2751
02:20:21,010 --> 02:20:21,630
Maybe go back to normal.

2752
02:20:22,410 --> 02:20:22,750
No!

2753
02:20:27,090 --> 02:20:27,890
Ant, I'm dead.

2754
02:20:28,930 --> 02:20:29,610
I died.

2755
02:20:29,910 --> 02:20:30,370
Oh no.

2756
02:20:30,750 --> 02:20:31,550
I should've moved.

2757
02:20:31,630 --> 02:20:32,850
I didn't know you had to do it then.

2758
02:20:34,770 --> 02:20:36,850
Okay, I was a little confused earlier.

2759
02:20:38,030 --> 02:20:38,590
It's okay.

2760
02:20:45,810 --> 02:20:46,010
Yay!

2761
02:20:46,370 --> 02:20:48,610
Oh, I didn't know how many rounds there were left.

2762
02:20:48,710 --> 02:20:49,990
I thought that was the last one.

2763
02:20:51,070 --> 02:20:52,770
Because it said 3 out of 4.

2764
02:20:53,350 --> 02:20:53,770
I'm tripped.

2765
02:20:56,010 --> 02:20:58,050
Oh wait, it doesn't say how many there are.

2766
02:20:58,550 --> 02:20:59,230
Oh, here?

2767
02:21:00,630 --> 02:21:01,730
Oh, okay.

2768
02:21:02,350 --> 02:21:03,510
I thought it was cheatable parkour.

2769
02:21:04,570 --> 02:21:06,370
I feel like it's worth just staying on the challenge side.

2770
02:21:06,850 --> 02:21:08,810
What does challenge do?

2771
02:21:09,290 --> 02:21:10,150
It gives more points.

2772
02:21:11,810 --> 02:21:11,850
Wow!

2773
02:21:11,850 --> 02:21:14,490
Oh, I should've stopped sides.

2774
02:21:14,590 --> 02:21:15,210
Well, I'm gone.

2775
02:21:15,550 --> 02:21:16,890
I should've gone back.

2776
02:21:17,130 --> 02:21:18,330
This one's very hard.

2777
02:21:19,830 --> 02:21:21,210
I have one life.

2778
02:21:21,550 --> 02:21:22,870
It's worth going back, to be honest.

2779
02:21:23,130 --> 02:21:23,710
I messed up.

2780
02:21:24,130 --> 02:21:25,670
Speed doesn't matter, does it?

2781
02:21:26,910 --> 02:21:28,970
It gets faster every time.

2782
02:21:31,010 --> 02:21:31,730
Oh, goodbye.

2783
02:21:32,030 --> 02:21:32,510
I'm out.

2784
02:21:33,650 --> 02:21:35,150
I was like, the fuck?

2785
02:21:35,150 --> 02:21:35,450
The fuck?

2786
02:21:35,650 --> 02:21:41,830
What the fuck was I looking at?

2787
02:21:47,560 --> 02:21:49,380
Wait, there's only one guy alive left.

2788
02:21:51,340 --> 02:21:51,860
Yay!

2789
02:21:56,480 --> 02:21:57,000
Baller!

2790
02:21:57,740 --> 02:21:59,220
Oh, I want to try again.

2791
02:22:00,080 --> 02:22:01,080
You get two rounds of it, I think.

2792
02:22:01,540 --> 02:22:01,780
Really?

2793
02:22:02,360 --> 02:22:02,880
Yay!

2794
02:22:05,200 --> 02:22:05,640
Nice.

2795
02:22:08,340 --> 02:22:08,660
Yay!

2796
02:22:08,780 --> 02:22:09,120
Donkey!

2797
02:22:10,260 --> 02:22:10,980
That's me!

2798
02:22:12,180 --> 02:22:12,940
That's me!

2799
02:22:14,720 --> 02:22:17,400
Wait, Ant, do you get more points if you get first place?

2800
02:22:19,240 --> 02:22:21,860
If you completed the whole map, you get extra points.

2801
02:22:22,060 --> 02:22:22,980
But I don't think anybody did.

2802
02:22:23,060 --> 02:22:24,620
I think Red died before the map ended.

2803
02:22:26,720 --> 02:22:27,940
Is that Evbo?

2804
02:22:27,940 --> 02:22:28,000
Is that Evbo?

2805
02:22:30,780 --> 02:22:31,160
Okay.

2806
02:22:32,340 --> 02:22:34,080
This is like a deathmatch.

2807
02:22:34,300 --> 02:22:35,700
Valorant deathmatch-esque.

2808
02:22:36,180 --> 02:22:37,460
Oh, I spawned right next to her.

2809
02:22:37,660 --> 02:22:38,840
It'll automatically reload your crossbow.

2810
02:22:39,800 --> 02:22:42,180
It auto-reloads your crossbow, so I guess you can just shoot.

2811
02:22:44,660 --> 02:22:44,920
Alright.

2812
02:22:45,500 --> 02:22:49,240
Yeah, and if you know where they're spawning, you can just camp it.

2813
02:22:51,180 --> 02:22:52,400
Okay, lock in, guys.

2814
02:22:52,460 --> 02:22:52,960
This is our game.

2815
02:22:53,160 --> 02:22:53,680
This is our game.

2816
02:22:53,680 --> 02:22:54,360
Woo!

2817
02:22:58,480 --> 02:22:59,780
Everybody's super close, though.

2818
02:23:00,240 --> 02:23:00,780
The points.

2819
02:23:01,440 --> 02:23:02,720
We killed each other!

2820
02:23:04,540 --> 02:23:05,600
Oh, we killed each other.

2821
02:23:05,740 --> 02:23:06,480
That's interesting.

2822
02:23:09,760 --> 02:23:10,860
Oh my god.

2823
02:23:11,780 --> 02:23:12,380
The AD.

2824
02:23:15,200 --> 02:23:16,340
Oh, Donkey, get him!

2825
02:23:16,740 --> 02:23:17,320
I can't!

2826
02:23:19,120 --> 02:23:23,720
Oh my god, I don't- I spawned- Are you serious?!

2827
02:23:23,720 --> 02:23:25,700
I don't know how to shoot anymore!

2828
02:23:26,800 --> 02:23:27,580
I'm washed!

2829
02:23:28,340 --> 02:23:28,740
No.

2830
02:23:29,080 --> 02:23:32,300
It automatically reloads, so don't stress, guys.

2831
02:23:33,300 --> 02:23:34,320
Oh my god, I'm washed.

2832
02:23:34,900 --> 02:23:43,040
I don't remember the- The charge- Oh my god, I don't remember!

2833
02:23:44,240 --> 02:23:45,340
The rain of fire!

2834
02:23:46,740 --> 02:23:49,560
I used to be a gamer at this.

2835
02:23:49,560 --> 02:23:52,380
He's hiding in the corner, crouching?

2836
02:23:54,240 --> 02:23:54,760
What?!

2837
02:23:55,320 --> 02:23:56,740
It's so over for me.

2838
02:23:59,580 --> 02:24:01,520
I literally just can't find anyone.

2839
02:24:01,640 --> 02:24:02,480
That's just my issue.

2840
02:24:04,620 --> 02:24:05,140
What?!

2841
02:24:05,140 --> 02:24:05,680
I'm feeding.

2842
02:24:07,320 --> 02:24:08,700
It's over for me.

2843
02:24:08,920 --> 02:24:09,880
I can't find anybody either.

2844
02:24:10,500 --> 02:24:13,700
Guys, my goal is one kill, guys.

2845
02:24:18,600 --> 02:24:20,480
There's no way- I did it!

2846
02:24:20,520 --> 02:24:21,620
I got one kill!

2847
02:24:24,200 --> 02:24:24,680
Okay.

2848
02:24:25,080 --> 02:24:26,380
I'm downloading the game.

2849
02:24:27,720 --> 02:24:28,080
We're doing good.

2850
02:24:28,120 --> 02:24:28,760
We're doing really good, by the way.

2851
02:24:29,660 --> 02:24:30,280
Thanks, guys.

2852
02:24:36,360 --> 02:24:36,840
What?!

2853
02:24:40,240 --> 02:24:40,720
Okay.

2854
02:24:58,510 --> 02:24:59,870
I'll learn.

2855
02:25:02,570 --> 02:25:03,950
I will learn.

2856
02:25:04,210 --> 02:25:06,750
No, I will not learn!

2857
02:25:11,090 --> 02:25:13,190
You guys, I got one kill.

2858
02:25:14,870 --> 02:25:16,830
It's okay, just cheat it.

2859
02:25:17,430 --> 02:25:18,070
No!

2860
02:25:21,850 --> 02:25:26,970
Why am I- One day, I will learn.

2861
02:25:27,390 --> 02:25:28,790
I keep trading.

2862
02:25:34,730 --> 02:25:36,310
Dr. Eggman, no!

2863
02:25:39,070 --> 02:25:40,570
What happened to me?

2864
02:25:40,650 --> 02:25:42,150
I used to be so good.

2865
02:25:42,570 --> 02:25:43,610
Last time.

2866
02:25:45,830 --> 02:25:46,870
Is it because I'm Tails?

2867
02:25:48,910 --> 02:25:53,490
Is it because- If I'm roleplaying as Tails, and that's what happened?

2868
02:25:58,010 --> 02:25:58,910
Oh my god.

2869
02:25:59,950 --> 02:26:01,490
Please, did I get that?

2870
02:26:01,610 --> 02:26:04,890
No, I couldn't even- Did I?

2871
02:26:05,090 --> 02:26:05,610
No, I didn't.

2872
02:26:06,870 --> 02:26:11,950
Guys, I think it's because I was Tails.

2873
02:26:16,430 --> 02:26:17,470
Not zero.

2874
02:26:18,390 --> 02:26:19,270
Not zero.

2875
02:26:22,090 --> 02:26:23,330
Kai's killstreak 8.

2876
02:26:23,610 --> 02:26:25,170
Oh, and us.

2877
02:26:28,210 --> 02:26:29,370
Hey, look, 6.

2878
02:26:30,430 --> 02:26:31,590
Not us, let's go.

2879
02:26:31,610 --> 02:26:33,250
There's like no point to put that all the way in.

2880
02:26:33,630 --> 02:26:34,750
This game doesn't even matter.

2881
02:26:34,870 --> 02:26:35,950
Literally, this game doesn't even matter.

2882
02:26:37,490 --> 02:26:38,530
Never go full Tails, guys.

2883
02:26:38,530 --> 02:26:40,250
I was one kill away from top 5.

2884
02:26:40,730 --> 02:26:42,210
Oh, nice!

2885
02:26:43,190 --> 02:26:43,610
Wow.

2886
02:26:44,310 --> 02:26:45,650
Never go full Tails.

2887
02:26:51,390 --> 02:26:55,130
We literally just have to be- We can be orange and pink in battle, for sure.

2888
02:26:57,630 --> 02:26:58,330
What else is there?

2889
02:26:58,510 --> 02:27:00,930
Spleef and- Spleef is sort of scary.

2890
02:27:01,030 --> 02:27:01,890
Maybe we should go with Spleef next.

2891
02:27:02,890 --> 02:27:04,510
Wait, is that all of Arcade?

2892
02:27:05,690 --> 02:27:06,370
My party?

2893
02:27:06,530 --> 02:27:06,690
Yeah.

2894
02:27:07,810 --> 02:27:15,290
So now we have Spleef Battle 8 minutes!

2895
02:27:16,130 --> 02:27:18,230
Why is it getting longer?

2896
02:27:22,490 --> 02:27:24,750
Why is it getting longer?

2897
02:27:25,910 --> 02:27:29,210
Wait, I'm going to see if there's Maria in this Minecraft skins.

2898
02:27:31,050 --> 02:27:31,510
Maria.

2899
02:27:31,670 --> 02:27:32,270
Margarita?

2900
02:27:32,550 --> 02:27:33,150
No, Maria.

2901
02:27:33,910 --> 02:27:36,270
Oh my god, there is!

2902
02:27:36,270 --> 02:27:37,910
Maria Robotnik!

2903
02:27:38,310 --> 02:27:39,390
We were cooking.

2904
02:27:40,310 --> 02:27:40,770
Wait.

2905
02:27:41,890 --> 02:27:44,290
I'm going to change skins real quick, guys.

2906
02:27:47,770 --> 02:27:50,130
In battle, we actually have to lock in.

2907
02:27:50,210 --> 02:27:50,850
No trolls.

2908
02:27:52,410 --> 02:27:53,590
I'm confident in battle.

2909
02:27:53,730 --> 02:27:57,810
I'm more scared about Blitz Hunt and Spleef, to be honest.

2910
02:27:58,210 --> 02:27:59,050
No, no, no.

2911
02:27:59,890 --> 02:28:04,070
I think this is the optimal lineup for us, for right now.

2912
02:28:04,070 --> 02:28:04,890
I agree, I agree.

2913
02:28:05,010 --> 02:28:05,450
I think we'll do good.

2914
02:28:07,030 --> 02:28:08,090
We'll cook in Blitz Hunt.

2915
02:28:09,850 --> 02:28:12,190
There's a reason Feinberg wanted to...

2916
02:28:14,690 --> 02:28:19,590
I think Purple wanted to play race last and battle now.

2917
02:28:19,810 --> 02:28:20,830
Because they're scared.

2918
02:28:27,310 --> 02:28:29,470
Doki, did you see the fuck you guy sent you?

2919
02:28:31,330 --> 02:28:31,810
Yeah.

2920
02:28:33,250 --> 02:28:33,710
Yeah.

2921
02:28:33,710 --> 02:28:33,790
Yeah.

2922
02:28:41,810 --> 02:28:43,950
Alright, I'm in.

2923
02:28:53,190 --> 02:28:55,430
Where is...

2924
02:29:24,960 --> 02:29:26,680
Dude, I think he's in shock.

2925
02:29:26,840 --> 02:29:28,580
He's in shock, yeah.

2926
02:29:30,040 --> 02:29:32,300
No, Shadow might be AFK.

2927
02:29:35,080 --> 02:29:38,360
Oh no, he's gonna miss Maria again.

2928
02:29:38,540 --> 02:29:40,380
Just look how...

2929
02:29:40,380 --> 02:29:41,760
And then she's just gonna die.

2930
02:29:43,120 --> 02:29:43,380
What?

2931
02:29:43,800 --> 02:29:44,660
Spoiler alert.

2932
02:29:45,040 --> 02:29:46,280
You don't know that?

2933
02:29:47,180 --> 02:29:47,520
No.

2934
02:29:48,320 --> 02:29:48,320
What?

2935
02:29:49,840 --> 02:29:50,720
They have guns?

2936
02:29:50,720 --> 02:29:52,800
It's Sonic the Hedgehog.

2937
02:29:53,460 --> 02:29:54,060
Yes!

2938
02:29:54,860 --> 02:29:57,440
Shadow fucking literally uses a gun.

2939
02:29:57,880 --> 02:29:58,820
He does?

2940
02:29:58,940 --> 02:29:59,440
Wait, really?

2941
02:29:59,660 --> 02:30:02,840
Yeah, in one of his first games.

2942
02:30:03,600 --> 02:30:06,780
He went to protect the president and then he has a gun.

2943
02:30:07,720 --> 02:30:08,800
It's true!

2944
02:30:09,100 --> 02:30:10,340
The president called him...

2945
02:30:10,940 --> 02:30:15,420
The president called Shadow the Hedgehog and he has a gun.

2946
02:30:16,160 --> 02:30:17,860
Dude, I feel like you're just making up shit.

2947
02:30:17,860 --> 02:30:19,360
No, it's true!

2948
02:30:19,540 --> 02:30:21,820
That's like the one Shadow game I wish they reboot.

2949
02:30:22,300 --> 02:30:23,300
They remaster.

2950
02:30:23,400 --> 02:30:25,480
It's his weapon of choice.

2951
02:30:26,240 --> 02:30:26,700
A gun?

2952
02:30:26,920 --> 02:30:27,220
Yeah!

2953
02:30:30,400 --> 02:30:31,360
Shadow gun.

2954
02:30:32,420 --> 02:30:34,520
It's a literal game on the PS2.

2955
02:30:35,920 --> 02:30:37,280
It's on the PS2.

2956
02:30:38,220 --> 02:30:40,720
Oh my god, he does have a gun.

2957
02:30:40,900 --> 02:30:42,860
Yeah, and then he talks with the president.

2958
02:30:43,740 --> 02:30:45,880
Why did Sega give Shadow a gun?

2959
02:30:48,080 --> 02:30:51,400
He uses a SIG SG551.

2960
02:30:52,340 --> 02:30:54,700
It has a 30 round capacity.

2961
02:30:59,040 --> 02:31:01,320
I wish they remastered Shadow.

2962
02:31:01,540 --> 02:31:02,120
That game.

2963
02:31:02,400 --> 02:31:04,940
That is the best Sonic game they've ever made.

2964
02:31:07,240 --> 02:31:09,520
Oh my god, the sun's about to go down.

2965
02:31:09,820 --> 02:31:11,440
Oh, the sun's already down.

2966
02:31:12,320 --> 02:31:13,600
They gave him the gun?

2967
02:31:13,720 --> 02:31:15,700
They gave him a gun in the new Sonic movie?

2968
02:31:15,700 --> 02:31:17,460
Oh my god, say less.

2969
02:31:17,860 --> 02:31:21,660
Wait, when is the new Sonic movie coming out, guys?

2970
02:31:22,800 --> 02:31:23,640
I think December.

2971
02:31:24,140 --> 02:31:25,680
Oh, no fun.

2972
02:31:27,380 --> 02:31:28,560
Wait, no, today is December.

2973
02:31:28,860 --> 02:31:29,960
Wait, oh my god, it's December.

2974
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,840
Oh, it's 20th.

2975
02:31:36,320 --> 02:31:38,380
Oh my god, it's gonna come out on the 20th.

2976
02:31:38,660 --> 02:31:40,960
Oh my god, early Christmas gift to me.

2977
02:31:44,680 --> 02:31:48,100
Yeah, and then they made the new expansion chat, but like, it's not the same.

2978
02:31:48,240 --> 02:31:49,740
You don't have a gun in that game.

2979
02:31:53,610 --> 02:31:54,810
I can't believe it.

2980
02:31:54,930 --> 02:31:55,970
I can't believe he's not.

2981
02:31:56,190 --> 02:31:58,390
I can't believe Shadow is AFK.

2982
02:32:01,690 --> 02:32:03,190
How could he do this to us?

2983
02:32:03,670 --> 02:32:05,790
Gumi, how do you not know Sonic lore?

2984
02:32:07,210 --> 02:32:07,890
And you're being a poser.

2985
02:32:07,890 --> 02:32:09,710
Because I never played any Sonic, man.

2986
02:32:09,790 --> 02:32:11,330
You're a fucking poser!

2987
02:32:12,130 --> 02:32:15,130
You're the one that told me to put on the Amy skin, you scumbag!

2988
02:32:15,150 --> 02:32:16,270
You're a poser!

2989
02:32:18,050 --> 02:32:20,390
I think Gumi might need to be voted off the team for that.

2990
02:32:20,550 --> 02:32:22,090
Oh my god.

2991
02:32:23,930 --> 02:32:24,770
Yeah, vote...

2992
02:32:25,240 --> 02:32:26,090
You're voted off the island.

2993
02:32:26,770 --> 02:32:28,330
You are a fuck you guy.

2994
02:32:29,090 --> 02:32:30,830
I knew you were a fuck you guy.

2995
02:32:31,110 --> 02:32:32,350
Oh my god.

2996
02:32:33,650 --> 02:32:36,690
You're the one that told me to be Amy, you scumbag!

2997
02:32:36,850 --> 02:32:40,290
I'm one of those people that are like, oh yeah, you know Sonic and Hedgehog?

2998
02:32:40,290 --> 02:32:42,550
Give me like...

2999
02:32:42,550 --> 02:32:45,110
Name me five Sonic characters right now.

3000
02:32:45,770 --> 02:32:46,510
That's right.

3001
02:32:54,320 --> 02:32:55,360
Oh god.

3002
02:32:56,280 --> 02:32:57,040
I can't believe...

3003
02:32:57,860 --> 02:33:00,420
I'm gonna go pee and then maybe he'll wake me up.

3004
02:33:00,740 --> 02:33:01,220
You know what?

3005
02:33:01,480 --> 02:33:02,400
I might drink a coffee.

3006
02:33:05,300 --> 02:33:06,960
You're gonna drink a coffee?

3007
02:33:16,190 --> 02:33:17,670
Wait, SK, do you know Sonic lore?

3008
02:33:18,750 --> 02:33:20,110
No, I don't know any.

3009
02:33:20,370 --> 02:33:22,250
Wait, you don't even play Sonic?

3010
02:33:22,570 --> 02:33:24,230
And you're a Sonic the Hedgehog?

3011
02:33:24,230 --> 02:33:25,290
It's Sonic skin.

3012
02:33:25,630 --> 02:33:26,510
Oh my god.

3013
02:33:27,210 --> 02:33:28,950
I used to play the...

3014
02:33:28,950 --> 02:33:30,970
There was like a Sega Mario Kart game.

3015
02:33:31,350 --> 02:33:32,650
Where you could be Sonic.

3016
02:33:33,650 --> 02:33:34,790
It was so fun.

3017
02:33:35,390 --> 02:33:37,190
You gotta play Sonic now.

3018
02:33:37,490 --> 02:33:40,630
If you're gonna be Sonic the Hedgehog, you gotta play Sonic.

3019
02:33:41,410 --> 02:33:42,430
I can't be a fraud.

3020
02:33:42,430 --> 02:33:44,170
Yeah, you can't be a fraud.

3021
02:33:47,430 --> 02:33:49,630
You're not a real gamer unless you play Sonic.

3022
02:33:49,990 --> 02:33:53,210
I was like trying to think of cool Sonic lines to say for real.

3023
02:33:53,370 --> 02:33:56,630
You didn't even say like, you're too slow.

3024
02:33:56,790 --> 02:33:57,650
You didn't even say that.

3025
02:33:57,830 --> 02:34:03,150
Wait a minute, does SK know anything about Sonic?

3026
02:34:03,750 --> 02:34:04,690
I'm an imposter.

3027
02:34:10,740 --> 02:34:12,580
Queen never cry.

3028
02:34:12,860 --> 02:34:14,420
Is there a queen number cry skin?

3029
02:34:15,700 --> 02:34:20,500
I'm pretty sure there is, but like, how would you make that a skin though?

3030
02:34:21,520 --> 02:34:22,760
Dude, the fuck ass baby.

3031
02:34:23,280 --> 02:34:23,600
That's L.

3032
02:34:24,620 --> 02:34:27,160
Guys, no, I was not a Sonic girl.

3033
02:34:27,500 --> 02:34:28,580
I learned more.

3034
02:34:29,220 --> 02:34:31,560
I just like to read Wikipedias.

3035
02:34:32,680 --> 02:34:34,320
Heimerdinger Minecraft skin.

3036
02:34:35,080 --> 02:34:35,500
Dude.

3037
02:34:36,020 --> 02:34:40,860
My favorite Sonic comic is the Knuckles Nipple comic.

3038
02:34:40,860 --> 02:34:41,660
What?

3039
02:34:42,860 --> 02:34:44,780
Wait, do you not know that comic?

3040
02:34:45,020 --> 02:34:46,660
Oh wait, you don't know Sonic lore.

3041
02:34:46,920 --> 02:34:51,580
That guy ended up becoming an official artist for Sonic the Hedgehog.

3042
02:34:52,540 --> 02:34:53,380
That is crazy.

3043
02:34:54,740 --> 02:34:57,360
I think we should vote for Hunt.

3044
02:34:57,940 --> 02:34:58,460
Or Spleef.

3045
02:34:59,640 --> 02:35:00,180
Where's Battle?

3046
02:35:00,840 --> 02:35:01,880
Oh, there's Battle.

3047
02:35:02,040 --> 02:35:02,260
Okay.

3048
02:35:02,540 --> 02:35:05,160
No, we have to do like, Spleef or something.

3049
02:35:05,340 --> 02:35:06,380
We cannot do Battle.

3050
02:35:07,540 --> 02:35:09,140
Okay, I'm gonna grab somebody.

3051
02:35:09,700 --> 02:35:11,000
Yeah, grab someone and bring them to Spleef.

3052
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,160
Oh, you can see what the games are by looking above.

3053
02:35:13,380 --> 02:35:14,600
There's a sign that says it.

3054
02:35:14,960 --> 02:35:16,060
How do I grab somebody?

3055
02:35:16,180 --> 02:35:16,920
Get over here.

3056
02:35:17,320 --> 02:35:18,680
You're coming here with me.

3057
02:35:19,580 --> 02:35:21,220
You're coming here with me.

3058
02:35:22,340 --> 02:35:23,520
Everybody get in the corner for Spleef.

3059
02:35:25,800 --> 02:35:27,240
I got him.

3060
02:35:27,380 --> 02:35:27,740
I got him.

3061
02:35:27,800 --> 02:35:30,260
I got somebody.

3062
02:35:30,880 --> 02:35:31,980
Oh wait, we're gonna, yeah, we get Spleef.

3063
02:35:33,840 --> 02:35:34,640
My savior.

3064
02:35:35,300 --> 02:35:35,840
My savior.

3065
02:35:35,840 --> 02:35:37,420
Yeah, we got it.

3066
02:35:37,500 --> 02:35:38,060
We got Spleef.

3067
02:35:38,200 --> 02:35:38,400
Yeah.

3068
02:35:40,600 --> 02:35:42,120
Not my captain.

3069
02:35:52,100 --> 02:35:52,500
Alright.

3070
02:35:54,600 --> 02:35:55,000
Alright.

3071
02:35:55,620 --> 02:35:56,820
Hunt, any suggestions?

3072
02:35:58,260 --> 02:36:01,680
I would do your best to try and stay together-ish if you can.

3073
02:36:02,580 --> 02:36:06,780
Islanding is fine, but the border will shove you in, so don't cut your way off to the middle.

3074
02:36:06,900 --> 02:36:09,340
But just from Snowballs in the beginning, try and stay alive together.

3075
02:36:10,820 --> 02:36:11,140
Alright.

3076
02:36:11,220 --> 02:36:12,580
Can I hit people with the Snowballs?

3077
02:36:13,840 --> 02:36:18,340
Yes, you can hit people, or you can hit blocks with Snowballs, and it'll break them.

3078
02:36:18,440 --> 02:36:26,980
There's one round of TNT Spleef where you'll get a bow, and if you shoot the ground, and there's like, if you shoot the ground, it'll blow up like a 3x3 area.

3079
02:36:30,020 --> 02:36:30,340
Awesome.

3080
02:36:34,340 --> 02:36:44,480
I think the highest layer that you can be on before it starts to decay, I think the third layer, everything decays together, so if you can stay on that layer, it's really good because you get the high ground.

3081
02:36:44,780 --> 02:36:46,260
Let's be friends, guys.

3082
02:36:46,480 --> 02:36:47,300
What do you mean by that, Ant?

3083
02:36:47,900 --> 02:36:53,780
So like, the first two layers will decay by themselves, but when you get to the third layer, the third, fourth, and fifth layer all decay together.

3084
02:36:53,940 --> 02:36:54,220
Oh yeah.

3085
02:36:54,620 --> 02:37:01,640
So the third layer is like the highest layer you can be on, which is good if you can stay there, but you can also farm kills on the bottom, except to...

3086
02:37:01,640 --> 02:37:01,780
you know.

3087
02:37:03,380 --> 02:37:04,900
That one's better to be higher.

3088
02:37:07,040 --> 02:37:09,200
Try not to, uh...

3089
02:37:09,200 --> 02:37:10,740
make any enemies, guys.

3090
02:37:11,220 --> 02:37:12,680
Do I know you?

3091
02:37:12,680 --> 02:37:13,660
Alright, lock in, lock in, lock in.

3092
02:37:14,680 --> 02:37:15,680
I have an enemy.

3093
02:37:15,900 --> 02:37:17,120
It's Shadow the Hedgehog.

3094
02:37:17,600 --> 02:37:17,820
True.

3095
02:37:18,060 --> 02:37:20,140
Let's find Shadow the Hedgehog and put an end to him.

3096
02:37:21,180 --> 02:37:21,620
No!

3097
02:37:21,980 --> 02:37:22,920
Not Shadow!

3098
02:37:24,200 --> 02:37:26,720
He's already gone through so much!

3099
02:37:28,340 --> 02:37:30,300
Oh my god, it's so laggy.

3100
02:37:31,280 --> 02:37:32,380
Okay, Hannah, just farm symbols on us.

3101
02:37:32,420 --> 02:37:33,760
The first layer does not matter that much.

3102
02:37:33,760 --> 02:37:35,640
Maybe Shadow won't...

3103
02:37:35,640 --> 02:37:38,900
Maybe Shadow won't try to kill me when he sees me.

3104
02:37:41,760 --> 02:37:42,160
Serious?

3105
02:37:42,520 --> 02:37:43,560
Oh my god.

3106
02:37:44,720 --> 02:37:46,940
Well, I will just dedicate my game to ruining your game.

3107
02:37:47,060 --> 02:37:48,180
Small ant, small ant, why?

3108
02:37:49,200 --> 02:37:49,600
Whoops.

3109
02:37:51,040 --> 02:37:51,840
Oh no.

3110
02:37:51,940 --> 02:37:52,860
You can break up, by the way.

3111
02:37:52,960 --> 02:37:54,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I broke up, but...

3112
02:37:54,880 --> 02:37:56,620
You actually thought you could do something.

3113
02:38:00,160 --> 02:38:01,600
I sleeped, CaptainSparklez.

3114
02:38:01,600 --> 02:38:03,500
Eleven-year-old me is freaking out.

3115
02:38:06,620 --> 02:38:09,120
How dare you not become friends!

3116
02:38:10,920 --> 02:38:13,060
These people are so evil!

3117
02:38:13,520 --> 02:38:15,660
I told you, nobody wants to be friends!

3118
02:38:16,020 --> 02:38:17,620
I try to be friends!

3119
02:38:18,960 --> 02:38:20,800
The live-shoot person!

3120
02:38:21,140 --> 02:38:21,740
I'm killing LineJack.

3121
02:38:23,160 --> 02:38:24,620
Don't... I mean...

3122
02:38:24,620 --> 02:38:27,380
I will dedicate the rest of my game to trolling you.

3123
02:38:27,900 --> 02:38:29,900
Why can't we be friends?

3124
02:38:29,900 --> 02:38:32,160
Why can't we be friends?

3125
02:38:32,320 --> 02:38:34,260
Why can't we be friends?

3126
02:38:34,580 --> 02:38:36,640
Why can't we be friends?

3127
02:38:37,660 --> 02:38:38,000
What?

3128
02:38:38,060 --> 02:38:38,560
How are you still alive?

3129
02:38:40,080 --> 02:38:42,140
Why can't we be friends?

3130
02:38:42,380 --> 02:38:44,180
Why can't we be friends?

3131
02:38:45,880 --> 02:38:47,900
No full auto in the building!

3132
02:38:49,860 --> 02:38:51,580
I got that reference.

3133
02:38:51,780 --> 02:38:52,820
That was so obscure.

3134
02:38:53,700 --> 02:38:54,340
Yes!

3135
02:38:55,280 --> 02:38:58,800
But we can try and just play high ground anyways.

3136
02:38:59,320 --> 02:39:01,500
Oh, handsome fellow on you, hold up.

3137
02:39:01,540 --> 02:39:01,960
Whoa!

3138
02:39:02,980 --> 02:39:04,420
He doesn't want the smoke.

3139
02:39:05,840 --> 02:39:07,180
I don't have any smoke.

3140
02:39:08,900 --> 02:39:10,620
Yeah, let's just try and stay here.

3141
02:39:11,200 --> 02:39:12,020
No one's really here.

3142
02:39:12,280 --> 02:39:13,940
There's some people above us, so...

3143
02:39:15,860 --> 02:39:20,800
Oh my god, he wants to fight me, but I just want to be friends.

3144
02:39:25,970 --> 02:39:30,010
Eventually we're going to have to go down to the third layer and fight for this.

3145
02:39:33,090 --> 02:39:33,650
Okay.

3146
02:39:35,030 --> 02:39:36,210
I'm scared now.

3147
02:39:37,570 --> 02:39:38,130
Awkward.

3148
02:39:39,010 --> 02:39:40,090
That's a little awkward.

3149
02:39:41,930 --> 02:39:42,330
What's this?

3150
02:39:43,030 --> 02:39:43,910
Okay, I died.

3151
02:39:45,490 --> 02:39:48,990
I feel like I got targeted by everybody.

3152
02:39:49,290 --> 02:39:50,250
I usually do, though.

3153
02:39:51,950 --> 02:39:53,350
It's okay, I made some friends.

3154
02:39:53,450 --> 02:39:54,530
Goomy, we got...

3155
02:39:57,330 --> 02:39:57,750
Uh-oh.

3156
02:40:01,280 --> 02:40:03,020
I'm on the last layer already.

3157
02:40:03,580 --> 02:40:04,040
Whoa!

3158
02:40:04,600 --> 02:40:05,200
Me too.

3159
02:40:05,320 --> 02:40:06,020
You're in a good spot.

3160
02:40:06,500 --> 02:40:06,620
No!

3161
02:40:07,200 --> 02:40:09,120
I got creeped!

3162
02:40:09,500 --> 02:40:10,720
Oh my god!

3163
02:40:11,100 --> 02:40:12,640
I got creeped so hard.

3164
02:40:14,980 --> 02:40:16,640
It's okay, I made friends last.

3165
02:40:17,580 --> 02:40:19,160
I lived as long as I could.

3166
02:40:20,100 --> 02:40:21,480
Hey, what's going on here?

3167
02:40:22,860 --> 02:40:23,600
What the?

3168
02:40:27,840 --> 02:40:28,720
Five up.

3169
02:40:28,840 --> 02:40:30,080
Five up is above you.

3170
02:40:30,600 --> 02:40:31,300
Where?

3171
02:40:31,660 --> 02:40:32,300
Five up.

3172
02:40:33,620 --> 02:40:34,520
Nice, stay there.

3173
02:40:35,340 --> 02:40:36,360
He's coming over!

3174
02:40:36,480 --> 02:40:38,600
Why would he kill himself for that?

3175
02:40:38,700 --> 02:40:39,400
Oh my god.

3176
02:40:41,340 --> 02:40:42,380
I placed seventh!

3177
02:40:42,920 --> 02:40:43,100
Yay!

3178
02:40:44,280 --> 02:40:45,220
Let's go!

3179
02:40:47,820 --> 02:40:49,420
This game is so troll.

3180
02:40:50,640 --> 02:40:53,920
I would say, Hanna, just don't... maybe just don't fight people as much then.

3181
02:40:54,360 --> 02:40:56,620
If people run at you, just try and...

3182
02:40:58,080 --> 02:40:59,800
Let's stand in the same area.

3183
02:41:00,420 --> 02:41:00,700
Okay.

3184
02:41:01,400 --> 02:41:02,060
Where are you?

3185
02:41:02,140 --> 02:41:02,760
I don't see you.

3186
02:41:02,840 --> 02:41:03,720
I see SK, though.

3187
02:41:04,760 --> 02:41:06,660
You're literally running the wrong way.

3188
02:41:07,160 --> 02:41:08,600
Oh, I see you, I see you, I see you.

3189
02:41:13,360 --> 02:41:14,140
Oh my god.

3190
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,120
Okay, SK, come here, SK.

3191
02:41:18,080 --> 02:41:19,320
Oh, okay, I'm coming.

3192
02:41:19,320 --> 02:41:19,980
Hello.

3193
02:41:20,380 --> 02:41:22,400
Oh, we're gonna make our own...

3194
02:41:22,400 --> 02:41:23,600
Oh, I like it.

3195
02:41:24,200 --> 02:41:26,680
Oh my god, it's like lagging here.

3196
02:41:27,160 --> 02:41:28,400
No, shut up's here.

3197
02:41:30,680 --> 02:41:30,940
Hi.

3198
02:41:31,220 --> 02:41:31,600
Eggman.

3199
02:41:33,240 --> 02:41:33,500
Hey.

3200
02:41:37,060 --> 02:41:39,260
Someone dug out from under me.

3201
02:41:39,400 --> 02:41:40,340
I'm below now.

3202
02:41:40,940 --> 02:41:42,320
Yeah, if you die, why don't you die?

3203
02:41:44,420 --> 02:41:45,720
That's good revenge.

3204
02:41:52,630 --> 02:41:53,010
Whoa.

3205
02:41:53,770 --> 02:41:55,970
Okay, I just got griefed again.

3206
02:41:56,130 --> 02:41:57,270
I'm just trying to stand still.

3207
02:41:57,630 --> 02:42:00,790
What if we go to the bottom layer and dig everything out?

3208
02:42:01,930 --> 02:42:04,470
What if I die because of that?

3209
02:42:07,630 --> 02:42:10,210
No, he doesn't want to be friends.

3210
02:42:11,650 --> 02:42:13,550
Why can't we be friends?

3211
02:42:13,930 --> 02:42:15,490
Why can't we be friends?

3212
02:42:17,710 --> 02:42:20,790
Yeah, friendship is so cool, guys.

3213
02:42:24,310 --> 02:42:27,270
Dude, I'm sensing there's some fuck you guys near me.

3214
02:42:27,930 --> 02:42:29,690
There's always fuck you guys.

3215
02:42:29,770 --> 02:42:31,210
Okay, Doki, this is the king.

3216
02:42:31,430 --> 02:42:37,510
I did not make the jump.

3217
02:42:40,050 --> 02:42:41,010
That's fine.

3218
02:42:41,130 --> 02:42:42,930
I like being down here.

3219
02:42:47,490 --> 02:42:49,170
Wait, wait, what?

3220
02:42:49,250 --> 02:42:52,510
I looked up for one second and I got hit.

3221
02:42:54,210 --> 02:42:56,310
I got hit at the bottom.

3222
02:42:57,830 --> 02:42:59,490
That's actually crazy.

3223
02:43:00,230 --> 02:43:02,150
How is Wall-E still up there?

3224
02:43:03,350 --> 02:43:04,170
I agree, Ty.

3225
02:43:08,870 --> 02:43:11,230
Don't hurt me, I'm just a little guy.

3226
02:43:11,250 --> 02:43:13,970
I would bet $1,000 five upset Targehanna.

3227
02:43:14,190 --> 02:43:15,590
To his team.

3228
02:43:16,990 --> 02:43:18,770
Alright, fuck you, I guess, too.

3229
02:43:21,130 --> 02:43:22,250
I think we just try and hold over here.

3230
02:43:22,370 --> 02:43:24,190
We're going to have to find a spot down here.

3231
02:43:26,850 --> 02:43:28,470
Everybody wants to kill.

3232
02:43:28,830 --> 02:43:29,770
And it makes me sad.

3233
02:43:30,970 --> 02:43:31,850
Shane, why?

3234
02:43:33,230 --> 02:43:35,330
Everyone has murder in their eyes.

3235
02:43:36,390 --> 02:43:37,730
The top was so free.

3236
02:43:38,270 --> 02:43:39,990
The top people were so nice.

3237
02:43:41,730 --> 02:43:43,070
Three layers at once.

3238
02:43:43,190 --> 02:43:45,810
Guys, people at the top were so nice.

3239
02:43:46,990 --> 02:43:49,250
The bottom was wild animals.

3240
02:43:49,250 --> 02:43:52,010
Wild animals at the bottom.

3241
02:43:54,510 --> 02:43:57,590
I made more friends at the top.

3242
02:44:00,940 --> 02:44:03,430
Oh my god, Antfrost, be careful.

3243
02:44:06,310 --> 02:44:09,130
Oh my god, that's crazy.

3244
02:44:11,470 --> 02:44:12,210
Nice.

3245
02:44:12,990 --> 02:44:14,570
It's close, though.

3246
02:44:14,950 --> 02:44:15,750
Yeah, nice work.

3247
02:44:17,010 --> 02:44:18,290
Message Fire Breath Man.

3248
02:44:19,310 --> 02:44:20,710
Watch your back.

3249
02:44:21,010 --> 02:44:21,710
Oh my god.

3250
02:44:21,790 --> 02:44:24,030
The people at the bottom are savages.

3251
02:44:26,370 --> 02:44:27,090
They're savages.

3252
02:44:27,470 --> 02:44:29,470
People at the top were so nice.

3253
02:44:30,470 --> 02:44:32,630
I was friends with people at the top.

3254
02:44:33,230 --> 02:44:34,110
Okay, so this one, SK.

3255
02:44:34,590 --> 02:44:36,690
You have a bow, and you shoot the ground.

3256
02:44:36,830 --> 02:44:38,890
You can shoot people, but if you shoot the ground, it'll break a 3x3.

3257
02:44:39,370 --> 02:44:41,070
The crossbow that you have, you can rocket jump with.

3258
02:44:41,130 --> 02:44:44,090
So if you shoot it in the ground under you, it'll just boost you up, and you can go up layers with it.

3259
02:44:44,090 --> 02:44:45,310
Okay, where are you?

3260
02:44:46,670 --> 02:44:48,530
Honestly, just use the crossbow off the rip.

3261
02:44:48,730 --> 02:44:49,570
Don't go on the outer layers.

3262
02:44:49,670 --> 02:44:50,810
Stay towards the middle, because it's safer there.

3263
02:44:51,070 --> 02:44:53,470
Use the crossbow off the rip, and just try it to see how it feels.

3264
02:44:54,570 --> 02:44:56,330
You can also use the crossbow if you want.

3265
02:44:56,490 --> 02:44:58,570
As a way to rocket jump and kill people.

3266
02:44:58,630 --> 02:44:59,310
Like if you're on somebody.

3267
02:45:04,510 --> 02:45:05,130
That's awesome.

3268
02:45:05,270 --> 02:45:06,770
You can shoot people with the bows, too.

3269
02:45:08,990 --> 02:45:10,350
I don't know if I can punch or not.

3270
02:45:17,210 --> 02:45:18,250
Joe Bart, please.

3271
02:45:24,210 --> 02:45:24,930
Oh, shit!

3272
02:45:28,210 --> 02:45:29,590
On you is a pink player.

3273
02:45:29,750 --> 02:45:30,750
No, I couldn't get that.

3274
02:45:30,830 --> 02:45:32,030
Oh, I almost got the shadow.

3275
02:45:32,830 --> 02:45:33,110
No!

3276
02:45:37,370 --> 02:45:37,950
That shadow!

3277
02:45:37,970 --> 02:45:39,310
Generally, staying on the top is pretty good.

3278
02:45:43,010 --> 02:45:43,650
It is.

3279
02:45:44,210 --> 02:45:45,110
Staying on the top is good.

3280
02:45:45,290 --> 02:45:46,450
I would go in more.

3281
02:45:46,930 --> 02:45:48,590
Staying on the outer layers here is scary.

3282
02:45:48,710 --> 02:45:49,870
Because you can get shot off the map easier.

3283
02:45:50,830 --> 02:45:51,130
True.

3284
02:45:52,830 --> 02:45:53,670
And grief 5 up.

3285
02:45:55,630 --> 02:45:56,290
Oh, no.

3286
02:45:57,370 --> 02:45:57,770
Goomy.

3287
02:45:59,470 --> 02:45:59,910
Goomy!

3288
02:46:00,530 --> 02:46:00,690
Oh.

3289
02:46:07,240 --> 02:46:07,680
No.

3290
02:46:09,020 --> 02:46:09,680
Oh, my God.

3291
02:46:09,720 --> 02:46:10,200
No, fuck.

3292
02:46:14,780 --> 02:46:16,480
Oh, I don't know where the...

3293
02:46:16,480 --> 02:46:17,100
Oh, God.

3294
02:46:17,200 --> 02:46:17,480
Goomy.

3295
02:46:18,880 --> 02:46:19,660
Oh, fuck.

3296
02:46:20,040 --> 02:46:20,960
Oh, my God.

3297
02:46:20,980 --> 02:46:22,200
I got dropped at the bottom.

3298
02:46:22,920 --> 02:46:23,240
No!

3299
02:46:23,500 --> 02:46:23,520
What?

3300
02:46:26,280 --> 02:46:28,260
I got hit on the side.

3301
02:46:30,460 --> 02:46:31,240
Oh, you're on the top.

3302
02:46:31,700 --> 02:46:32,860
But they're gonna come back up.

3303
02:46:35,500 --> 02:46:36,120
Behind you, Ant.

3304
02:46:36,900 --> 02:46:37,220
Oh.

3305
02:46:38,900 --> 02:46:39,740
Where were you guys?

3306
02:46:39,900 --> 02:46:40,460
Oh, nice.

3307
02:46:44,070 --> 02:46:45,290
Guys, I was in the first one out.

3308
02:46:45,350 --> 02:46:45,810
Look at this.

3309
02:46:45,890 --> 02:46:46,470
Oh, my God.

3310
02:46:48,750 --> 02:46:51,730
I'm alive for now, but...

3311
02:46:51,730 --> 02:46:52,890
Alright, SK, we're in a good spot.

3312
02:46:52,990 --> 02:46:53,390
But behind you.

3313
02:46:53,770 --> 02:46:54,230
Oh, never mind.

3314
02:46:54,250 --> 02:46:54,490
They fell.

3315
02:46:55,770 --> 02:46:56,350
Behind you.

3316
02:46:56,850 --> 02:46:56,970
Oh.

3317
02:46:59,370 --> 02:46:59,950
Oh, my.

3318
02:47:01,050 --> 02:47:02,530
Guys, you guys... Whoa!

3319
02:47:02,650 --> 02:47:03,510
You guys are gaming!

3320
02:47:12,050 --> 02:47:12,590
Oh, my God.

3321
02:47:12,590 --> 02:47:14,050
There's so many aimers here.

3322
02:47:16,090 --> 02:47:16,790
Oh, God!

3323
02:47:17,830 --> 02:47:18,530
Oh, no.

3324
02:47:19,150 --> 02:47:20,150
Can purple, like, stop?

3325
02:47:22,210 --> 02:47:22,610
Nope.

3326
02:47:23,630 --> 02:47:24,590
He's coming back.

3327
02:47:24,630 --> 02:47:25,530
He's coming back.

3328
02:47:25,530 --> 02:47:26,250
I see him.

3329
02:47:27,970 --> 02:47:28,630
I died.

3330
02:47:29,730 --> 02:47:30,850
Oh, it's you, Ant.

3331
02:47:30,950 --> 02:47:31,610
You got this.

3332
02:47:33,210 --> 02:47:34,790
Oh, you're still alive.

3333
02:47:34,910 --> 02:47:35,750
You're so healthy.

3334
02:47:40,890 --> 02:47:41,410
No!

3335
02:47:42,810 --> 02:47:44,770
That was so fucked!

3336
02:47:46,390 --> 02:47:47,650
That was so fucked.

3337
02:47:49,090 --> 02:47:49,950
Nice work.

3338
02:47:50,210 --> 02:47:51,430
Yeah, that was really good.

3339
02:47:52,590 --> 02:47:54,850
We got third this round.

3340
02:47:55,670 --> 02:47:56,530
It's pretty good.

3341
02:47:57,890 --> 02:47:59,730
Whoa, fourth is really good.

3342
02:47:59,870 --> 02:48:00,190
We did better.

3343
02:48:00,330 --> 02:48:02,630
Look, we didn't do better than pink, purple, and orange.

3344
02:48:02,690 --> 02:48:05,270
And we didn't do better than purple and orange, but we cleared pink by, like, a mile.

3345
02:48:05,490 --> 02:48:06,110
Like, we did really good.

3346
02:48:09,990 --> 02:48:11,010
I'm, like, the mascot.

3347
02:48:15,630 --> 02:48:17,030
I'm here to roleplay.

3348
02:48:17,630 --> 02:48:18,270
There's tears.

3349
02:48:18,530 --> 02:48:18,890
Don't worry.

3350
02:48:20,330 --> 02:48:21,230
I'm just...

3351
02:48:21,230 --> 02:48:22,310
I'm the roleplayer.

3352
02:48:32,110 --> 02:48:32,630
Um...

3353
02:48:33,830 --> 02:48:34,350
What?

3354
02:48:35,470 --> 02:48:36,930
We just got battle last, right?

3355
02:48:37,010 --> 02:48:38,330
Like, we just got battle last single.

3356
02:48:39,530 --> 02:48:39,850
We have to.

3357
02:48:39,850 --> 02:48:41,910
But will we get battle last, though?

3358
02:48:42,750 --> 02:48:43,270
Um...

3359
02:48:43,270 --> 02:48:44,010
Maybe not.

3360
02:48:46,010 --> 02:48:47,510
What's our last two games?

3361
02:48:48,670 --> 02:48:49,750
Blitz hunt and battle.

3362
02:48:49,750 --> 02:48:51,450
What's blitz hunt again?

3363
02:48:52,130 --> 02:48:53,330
That's the hide and seek game.

3364
02:48:53,470 --> 02:48:54,010
Oh, shit.

3365
02:48:54,090 --> 02:48:54,630
That one.

3366
02:48:54,730 --> 02:48:54,970
Okay.

3367
02:48:58,390 --> 02:48:59,630
Thank you for the raid!

3368
02:48:59,750 --> 02:49:00,650
I didn't see who raided.

3369
02:49:01,090 --> 02:49:03,630
Thank you so much.

3370
02:49:04,830 --> 02:49:06,550
I'm doing a Minecraft block wars.

3371
02:49:06,610 --> 02:49:10,590
I usually don't stream on Twitch, but this is a Twitch Rivals for charity.

3372
02:49:11,390 --> 02:49:14,770
I'm the mascot because I'm not doing so well individually.

3373
02:49:14,770 --> 02:49:16,090
You guys are so nice.

3374
02:49:18,330 --> 02:49:20,070
Oh, Leina, thank you for the raid.

3375
02:49:20,170 --> 02:49:21,430
I really appreciate it.

3376
02:49:22,290 --> 02:49:22,970
Guys, it's okay.

3377
02:49:23,110 --> 02:49:24,650
I'm here for roleplay RP.

3378
02:49:25,110 --> 02:49:26,550
This is my RP session.

3379
02:49:34,030 --> 02:49:35,810
Yeah, we like... Okay, and...

3380
02:49:35,810 --> 02:49:37,690
So, it's not capturing points anymore?

3381
02:49:37,930 --> 02:49:38,710
Or... No, it is.

3382
02:49:38,730 --> 02:49:39,890
You have to, like, go on...

3383
02:49:39,890 --> 02:49:42,030
There are the capture points, which are really good for points.

3384
02:49:42,030 --> 02:49:43,410
And then there's also the PvP.

3385
02:49:43,930 --> 02:49:45,050
You just have to walk on it.

3386
02:49:45,130 --> 02:49:46,710
We're going to go for a point no matter what.

3387
02:49:46,770 --> 02:49:49,890
We're never going to, like, not take a point because someone else is there.

3388
02:49:49,970 --> 02:49:51,950
Because we're probably better than all the other teams.

3389
02:49:53,090 --> 02:49:57,750
Do you think that we should use the damages from the totem kit, like, when we're sword fighting?

3390
02:49:57,870 --> 02:49:58,630
Or when we're bow fighting?

3391
02:49:59,490 --> 02:50:00,630
When we're sword fighting.

3392
02:50:00,730 --> 02:50:02,230
We should place it on the point.

3393
02:50:02,330 --> 02:50:03,430
We place it on the actual point.

3394
02:50:04,070 --> 02:50:04,290
Okay.

3395
02:50:05,550 --> 02:50:08,210
I mean, that's what I did, and it worked really well.

3396
02:50:08,830 --> 02:50:09,130
Yeah.

3397
02:50:15,990 --> 02:50:20,710
I mean, I think, like, what if we're in a situation where we're having a bow fight over the point, though?

3398
02:50:20,930 --> 02:50:23,690
Like, if they're, like, shooting at us a lot and we can't really sword fight them.

3399
02:50:23,750 --> 02:50:26,670
Then we should be standing on the point bowing them.

3400
02:50:27,370 --> 02:50:28,430
Like, so then we get the point.

3401
02:50:28,690 --> 02:50:34,150
Well, I mean, if you're on archer, like, the damage totem does, like, boost your bow damage a lot.

3402
02:50:34,170 --> 02:50:35,030
I don't play archer.

3403
02:50:35,750 --> 02:50:36,790
You don't play archer?

3404
02:50:37,170 --> 02:50:38,410
I've never played archer.

3405
02:50:38,970 --> 02:50:40,970
I mean, it's...

3406
02:50:40,970 --> 02:50:46,710
I think the best kits are archer and summoner because I think scout or whatever it is has chainmail, which is really bad armor.

3407
02:50:47,070 --> 02:50:47,410
Okay.

3408
02:50:48,610 --> 02:50:51,170
If you don't want to play archer, I don't mind playing archer, but...

3409
02:50:51,170 --> 02:50:51,770
What's summoner?

3410
02:50:53,350 --> 02:51:01,610
Summoner... I don't know if it's, like, a crossbow or what it is, or snowball and egg, but you can spawn mobs, and they just, like, do damage, essentially.

3411
02:51:01,610 --> 02:51:01,730
Which one has the TNT?

3412
02:51:05,230 --> 02:51:06,430
I don't remember what it's called.

3413
02:51:06,430 --> 02:51:07,110
Like the creeper one?

3414
02:51:07,630 --> 02:51:08,150
I don't know.

3415
02:51:08,230 --> 02:51:09,850
Yeah, I don't think it's very good.

3416
02:51:09,850 --> 02:51:12,710
Guys, so in battle, we're going to go to the first point.

3417
02:51:13,050 --> 02:51:25,270
Realistically, we should all be, like, standing on it, capturing the point, and that's when SK, if you want to go that, like, OP kit where it has, like, the villager totems, you can place, like, the healing one on us, and then when they start running at us,

3418
02:51:25,290 --> 02:51:28,530
like, place the the damage one.

3419
02:51:28,890 --> 02:51:31,850
And then you have really OP armor, too, because all of the...

3420
02:51:32,370 --> 02:51:34,550
Yeah, all the healer classes get diamond armor for no reason.

3421
02:51:34,730 --> 02:51:37,350
Yeah, so we're gonna run three healer classes regardless.

3422
02:51:37,770 --> 02:51:38,250
It's hard to die.

3423
02:51:50,190 --> 02:51:50,510
Yeah.

3424
02:51:50,970 --> 02:51:55,810
Isn't your health, like, decays down?

3425
02:51:55,970 --> 02:51:56,930
You lose all your items?

3426
02:51:59,210 --> 02:51:59,850
I think we go hunt.

3427
02:51:59,990 --> 02:52:01,490
I don't think we're gonna get it, but we might as well try.

3428
02:52:01,990 --> 02:52:02,530
We have to.

3429
02:52:02,550 --> 02:52:03,550
We have to go blitz hunt.

3430
02:52:03,650 --> 02:52:06,250
It's unlikely we're gonna get hunt, unless we get...

3431
02:52:06,250 --> 02:52:08,430
Oh my god, there's a TNT in pink, in the hunt area.

3432
02:52:08,590 --> 02:52:09,510
I can do a TNT.

3433
02:52:10,230 --> 02:52:11,750
Wait, they're putting TNT on us!

3434
02:52:12,570 --> 02:52:14,130
We lost three people, that's unlucky.

3435
02:52:14,910 --> 02:52:15,810
I killed people, too, though.

3436
02:52:15,970 --> 02:52:16,350
Nice, Hannah.

3437
02:52:17,510 --> 02:52:18,730
Wait, we have a revival title!

3438
02:52:20,870 --> 02:52:22,950
It's okay, I can live forever.

3439
02:52:25,530 --> 02:52:28,050
I think people are booting...

3440
02:52:28,050 --> 02:52:29,570
Oh, no, the cat's going forward.

3441
02:52:29,830 --> 02:52:31,210
Yeah, I think it's gonna be battle.

3442
02:52:31,690 --> 02:52:33,970
That's a lot of people in battle, guys.

3443
02:52:37,390 --> 02:52:40,390
Like, they don't understand that none of them are going to be able to come back.

3444
02:52:41,230 --> 02:52:45,050
Because blitz hunt has such a small point differential, nobody's going to be able to come back.

3445
02:52:45,150 --> 02:52:45,650
Okay, gg.

3446
02:52:45,850 --> 02:52:47,290
Fighters versus phantoms at the end.

3447
02:52:48,130 --> 02:52:49,230
I don't understand.

3448
02:52:49,590 --> 02:52:51,550
We just have to have a generational battle.

3449
02:52:52,730 --> 02:52:53,410
Like, I'm sorry.

3450
02:52:53,830 --> 02:52:55,030
They just don't understand.

3451
02:52:56,710 --> 02:52:57,430
It's fine, it's fine.

3452
02:52:57,550 --> 02:52:58,330
We'll cook this game.

3453
02:52:58,850 --> 02:52:59,430
Ah, Maria.

3454
02:53:03,930 --> 02:53:05,950
Oh, that's new!

3455
02:53:07,730 --> 02:53:13,490
At the very very end, that like white place, that's the only place that you can survive.

3456
02:53:14,070 --> 02:53:16,110
Like, at the final final border.

3457
02:53:18,030 --> 02:53:18,890
What was I before?

3458
02:53:20,270 --> 02:53:21,790
Gumi, what did I play last time?

3459
02:53:22,530 --> 02:53:23,330
You played a healer.

3460
02:53:23,530 --> 02:53:24,570
I know, but which one?

3461
02:53:25,170 --> 02:53:25,850
Was I the fairy?

3462
02:53:26,450 --> 02:53:27,130
Yeah, fairy.

3463
02:53:27,370 --> 02:53:29,810
You regen us whenever you're near us, you just give us regen like always.

3464
02:53:30,210 --> 02:53:30,210
Yeah.

3465
02:53:30,710 --> 02:53:32,890
No, I think Giga was fairy.

3466
02:53:34,110 --> 02:53:36,250
I think I was the other one with the potions.

3467
02:53:36,930 --> 02:53:44,050
Okay, so we're gonna have to like stand on these, and SK, that's where you'll place the healing, and then when they when we're fighting them on the point, also place that.

3468
02:53:44,110 --> 02:53:50,490
So, the totems are one-shots, so if they're like shooting at us, SK, try and put it in a way where it's like on us, but like behind most of us.

3469
02:53:50,510 --> 02:53:51,070
No, they're not one-shot.

3470
02:53:51,210 --> 02:53:52,590
You get them back.

3471
02:53:52,590 --> 02:53:56,330
No, no, no, I mean like if they shoot the totem it dies, and it'll go on cooldown.

3472
02:53:56,550 --> 02:53:58,210
It's a breakable one-shot, is what I'm saying.

3473
02:53:59,210 --> 02:54:00,570
Yeah, where would I put it on that point?

3474
02:54:00,690 --> 02:54:01,370
There's nowhere good.

3475
02:54:02,210 --> 02:54:03,190
Just like behind us.

3476
02:54:03,250 --> 02:54:04,510
Honestly, just put it behind us.

3477
02:54:04,630 --> 02:54:05,670
We're never capturing this.

3478
02:54:06,070 --> 02:54:11,030
Like on us, but in the back so that we don't get for all the kits.

3479
02:54:11,670 --> 02:54:12,790
So I want it to be the totem.

3480
02:54:13,590 --> 02:54:13,770
Yeah.

3481
02:54:16,630 --> 02:54:16,990
Uh...

3482
02:54:18,150 --> 02:54:20,630
I think I liked summoner last time.

3483
02:54:20,630 --> 02:54:22,990
I was the one with the potion.

3484
02:54:23,870 --> 02:54:25,370
I was gonna run summoner if that's okay with me.

3485
02:54:25,810 --> 02:54:26,970
Who was the...

3486
02:54:26,970 --> 02:54:27,550
Or did you want it?

3487
02:54:27,690 --> 02:54:27,810
Okay.

3488
02:54:28,250 --> 02:54:30,590
Who was the potion healer?

3489
02:54:31,030 --> 02:54:32,130
It's probably the last one.

3490
02:54:32,670 --> 02:54:34,030
Medic, I think it's medic.

3491
02:54:34,330 --> 02:54:35,650
Yeah, I like medic.

3492
02:54:40,210 --> 02:54:41,010
Okay, um...

3493
02:54:41,010 --> 02:54:44,010
So we, so do we have one person on totem, fairy, and medic?

3494
02:54:45,170 --> 02:54:46,070
I think we should.

3495
02:54:46,310 --> 02:54:47,350
SK, can you go totem?

3496
02:54:48,070 --> 02:54:49,670
Oh, summoner gets the TNT chickens.

3497
02:54:50,410 --> 02:54:52,650
Mac, absorption, insta health.

3498
02:54:53,550 --> 02:54:54,730
I think you should go archer.

3499
02:54:55,710 --> 02:54:58,850
Archer is like, you get full iron, you get a bow, and you get a stone sword.

3500
02:54:59,010 --> 02:54:59,670
Okay, fine.

3501
02:55:00,970 --> 02:55:02,410
You don't get arrows back, do you?

3502
02:55:02,910 --> 02:55:04,070
You do, you get them over time.

3503
02:55:05,030 --> 02:55:05,950
Okay, fine, fine, fine.

3504
02:55:06,270 --> 02:55:08,190
And every two or three shots you hit, you get a damage arrow.

3505
02:55:08,410 --> 02:55:10,470
Which is a ton of damage.

3506
02:55:10,490 --> 02:55:11,910
Insta health, absorption.

3507
02:55:12,230 --> 02:55:13,710
Who do I throw absorption at?

3508
02:55:14,750 --> 02:55:16,890
Um, we're about to fight and you throw absorption on us.

3509
02:55:16,890 --> 02:55:18,050
Oh, Gumi, where are you going?

3510
02:55:19,030 --> 02:55:21,290
Uh, I was told we were running three supports.

3511
02:55:21,570 --> 02:55:27,470
I mean, honestly, like, the thing is, the diamond armor alone makes it broken, but the other classes are just bad.

3512
02:55:28,150 --> 02:55:32,210
Like, if you play scout or assassin, you just instant die because it's leather and chainmail.

3513
02:55:32,310 --> 02:55:33,450
Like, you just can't live on those kits.

3514
02:55:36,690 --> 02:55:45,050
Um, I think honestly, Gumi, you can sort of, like, yeah, I think you can sort of play on the frontlines with us, like, just critting people out.

3515
02:55:45,050 --> 02:55:47,290
Because you have full diamond, you have regen for all of us.

3516
02:55:47,490 --> 02:55:53,890
Like, I think if we get a damage totem, you'd, like, two or three shot people with crits if it's active on you.

3517
02:55:59,030 --> 02:56:01,730
Okay, I guess it looks like everyone else is doing your strategy.

3518
02:56:01,950 --> 02:56:02,590
They learned from you.

3519
02:56:02,850 --> 02:56:02,950
Yeah.

3520
02:56:04,490 --> 02:56:08,350
I mean, it's just good, but I think we'll do it better, so it's fine.

3521
02:56:09,010 --> 02:56:09,330
Whoa!

3522
02:56:10,150 --> 02:56:10,930
Should I offhand the bow?

3523
02:56:11,070 --> 02:56:11,270
Where am I?

3524
02:56:11,270 --> 02:56:14,990
Hannah, this is that one map with, like, all this snow and airy like this.

3525
02:56:15,770 --> 02:56:16,570
Just follow me and Hannah.

3526
02:56:17,690 --> 02:56:19,350
I think we go straight and go to the side here.

3527
02:56:19,410 --> 02:56:20,190
I think we go out the window here, I think.

3528
02:56:21,850 --> 02:56:22,270
Alright, cool.

3529
02:56:24,330 --> 02:56:24,610
Right?

3530
02:56:25,650 --> 02:56:26,610
And then we go out here.

3531
02:56:27,410 --> 02:56:28,410
Come up here, come up here.

3532
02:56:28,690 --> 02:56:30,070
Right here, right here.

3533
02:56:30,370 --> 02:56:30,750
Blue's coming.

3534
02:56:30,910 --> 02:56:31,570
Jump on this point.

3535
02:56:32,550 --> 02:56:32,790
I'll bow.

3536
02:56:35,950 --> 02:56:37,230
Place the healing on us.

3537
02:56:37,550 --> 02:56:37,770
I did.

3538
02:56:38,130 --> 02:56:39,430
Healing totem in the back, healing totem in the back.

3539
02:56:39,470 --> 02:56:39,910
We have it.

3540
02:56:41,330 --> 02:56:42,910
Once we have the point, we can leave.

3541
02:56:43,950 --> 02:56:45,610
Yeah, just... we're almost... we got it, we got it.

3542
02:56:45,630 --> 02:56:46,410
Let's leave, let's leave.

3543
02:56:47,530 --> 02:56:48,230
Go to the middle.

3544
02:56:49,470 --> 02:56:50,490
Yeah, let's just go middle.

3545
02:56:51,910 --> 02:56:52,750
Look out, there's void, there's void.

3546
02:56:53,550 --> 02:56:54,770
Watch out for the void.

3547
02:56:55,950 --> 02:56:56,850
Hold this, hold this.

3548
02:56:57,390 --> 02:56:59,430
After this, guys... oh, we have to jump back, Hannah.

3549
02:56:59,670 --> 02:57:00,150
Oh, that's weird.

3550
02:57:00,310 --> 02:57:00,390
Okay.

3551
02:57:01,310 --> 02:57:02,690
This is void, we have to jump back.

3552
02:57:04,170 --> 02:57:05,050
You can blue and leave.

3553
02:57:05,050 --> 02:57:06,290
I don't have damage.

3554
02:57:06,290 --> 02:57:07,830
Shoot them from the damage, Hannah.

3555
02:57:08,410 --> 02:57:09,890
We have the point, guys, we need to go.

3556
02:57:10,230 --> 02:57:11,330
Come here, come here, jump to me.

3557
02:57:12,990 --> 02:57:14,390
Whoa, that's fine, I'm okay.

3558
02:57:15,030 --> 02:57:16,050
Let's hold the top right.

3559
02:57:17,010 --> 02:57:18,850
Let's go up here, let's go up and go back, Hannah.

3560
02:57:19,230 --> 02:57:20,470
Are you sure we just hold mid?

3561
02:57:21,030 --> 02:57:21,410
Yeah, mid.

3562
02:57:22,690 --> 02:57:23,690
Actually, this is really good.

3563
02:57:23,930 --> 02:57:25,790
Look at this bridge right here.

3564
02:57:26,110 --> 02:57:27,570
This is a fight, though.

3565
02:57:27,610 --> 02:57:28,310
Do you want to third party, Hannah?

3566
02:57:28,430 --> 02:57:30,410
Yeah, let's see if we can get a clean on somebody here.

3567
02:57:30,570 --> 02:57:31,710
Wait, let's chill for a second.

3568
02:57:33,030 --> 02:57:33,890
Whoa, there's a zone.

3569
02:57:34,730 --> 02:57:35,390
Come back, come back.

3570
02:57:35,550 --> 02:57:36,230
Oh my god.

3571
02:57:37,990 --> 02:57:39,710
We have a spot right here, I don't hate this.

3572
02:57:39,710 --> 02:57:41,210
Let's go right here, this is perfect.

3573
02:57:42,870 --> 02:57:43,870
I'm going to shoot their...

3574
02:57:43,870 --> 02:57:44,890
It's so chill up here.

3575
02:57:46,110 --> 02:57:47,570
We're not fighting, there's a lot of fights going on.

3576
02:57:48,230 --> 02:57:48,830
Hey, guys.

3577
02:57:51,010 --> 02:57:52,550
Wait, you change your skin back to me?

3578
02:57:52,550 --> 02:57:53,290
I don't know.

3579
02:57:54,090 --> 02:57:55,230
We have to help the opposer.

3580
02:57:55,910 --> 02:57:56,550
Hannah, keep shooting, keep shooting.

3581
02:57:58,330 --> 02:57:59,430
Hide, hide.

3582
02:58:00,110 --> 02:58:01,430
Hide behind that wall, hide behind that wall.

3583
02:58:02,010 --> 02:58:02,710
Oh, they broke it.

3584
02:58:03,790 --> 02:58:04,770
I'll try and break theirs.

3585
02:58:05,130 --> 02:58:05,850
I broke it.

3586
02:58:07,390 --> 02:58:09,490
I have no arrows, currently.

3587
02:58:09,570 --> 02:58:11,410
We have to go ahead and stay... you'll regen, you'll regen, you'll regen.

3588
02:58:11,870 --> 02:58:13,210
Okay, so we're going to fall right...

3589
02:58:13,210 --> 02:58:14,950
and we're going to stay top, we're going to stay on the top.

3590
02:58:15,450 --> 02:58:16,010
Alright, cool.

3591
02:58:16,710 --> 02:58:18,890
I have instant heals if you guys... whoever needs it.

3592
02:58:19,170 --> 02:58:20,030
Keep shooting fruit if you can, Hannah.

3593
02:58:21,910 --> 02:58:23,190
I have no arrows.

3594
02:58:24,890 --> 02:58:26,050
It's just like Fortnite.

3595
02:58:26,570 --> 02:58:27,090
Oh my god.

3596
02:58:27,850 --> 02:58:28,530
I'm chilling.

3597
02:58:29,850 --> 02:58:30,990
We do need kills.

3598
02:58:31,750 --> 02:58:33,290
We could kill...

3599
02:58:33,290 --> 02:58:33,610
actually.

3600
02:58:34,630 --> 02:58:37,370
Let's wait for pink to fight purple and then let's do something, maybe.

3601
02:58:38,350 --> 02:58:39,530
I think we should go down, I think we should...

3602
02:58:39,530 --> 02:58:40,550
I think we should go down a little bit, yeah.

3603
02:58:40,670 --> 02:58:42,850
Oh, we're smoked, they smoked us.

3604
02:58:42,910 --> 02:58:44,990
There's like people over on...

3605
02:58:44,990 --> 02:58:45,890
We're hidden right now.

3606
02:58:46,770 --> 02:58:47,890
Purple's under us, purple's under us.

3607
02:58:48,870 --> 02:58:50,010
Don't engage, don't engage.

3608
02:58:50,570 --> 02:58:51,970
Purple's down two players, purple's down two players.

3609
02:58:52,190 --> 02:58:52,750
They're fighting pink right now.

3610
02:58:53,770 --> 02:58:54,930
Okay, let's run at pink.

3611
02:58:55,010 --> 02:58:56,610
Let's just run at pink and start critting them out.

3612
02:59:00,270 --> 02:59:02,690
Oh my god, what happens to my sword?

3613
02:59:04,170 --> 02:59:04,810
Fineberg is low.

3614
02:59:05,950 --> 02:59:07,930
Alright guys, let's try and stay together a little bit.

3615
02:59:08,370 --> 02:59:09,370
You're like alone at mid.

3616
02:59:10,710 --> 02:59:11,970
Shane's low, Shane's low, Shane's on six.

3617
02:59:15,310 --> 02:59:16,230
Shane's low, Shane's low, Shane's low.

3618
02:59:17,110 --> 02:59:18,010
Stay together, stay together, stay together.

3619
02:59:19,310 --> 02:59:19,630
Yay!

3620
02:59:19,630 --> 02:59:19,750
Yay!

3621
02:59:21,270 --> 02:59:21,910
Oh, careful.

3622
02:59:22,590 --> 02:59:24,690
Come middle, come middle.

3623
02:59:24,850 --> 02:59:25,090
Okay.

3624
02:59:26,990 --> 02:59:28,110
Shoot blue, Hannah, shoot blue.

3625
02:59:29,170 --> 02:59:30,150
I'm trying to get a kill.

3626
02:59:31,410 --> 02:59:33,230
I'm sorry, I don't want a kill still, but...

3627
02:59:33,230 --> 02:59:33,830
I want to confirm that.

3628
02:59:34,510 --> 02:59:37,150
Hold middle and try to hit them in the void.

3629
02:59:39,410 --> 02:59:40,050
If possible.

3630
02:59:40,090 --> 02:59:40,430
We got orange.

3631
02:59:42,130 --> 02:59:45,110
No, no, we're fine, we're good.

3632
02:59:45,450 --> 02:59:46,810
Look blue, look blue, blue's the big team.

3633
02:59:51,270 --> 02:59:52,850
Like, get little crits if you can.

3634
02:59:54,070 --> 02:59:55,090
Okay, Michael, make sure...

3635
02:59:57,410 --> 02:59:58,310
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead.

3636
02:59:58,790 --> 03:00:00,010
Okay, look at that two blue.

3637
03:00:05,360 --> 03:00:06,780
Yeah, get little crits on them like that.

3638
03:00:10,560 --> 03:00:11,520
Get shooting, get shooting, get shooting.

3639
03:00:11,760 --> 03:00:12,960
I'm getting shot.

3640
03:00:14,220 --> 03:00:15,660
Final, final, final fight.

3641
03:00:16,360 --> 03:00:16,780
It's Igben!

3642
03:00:17,700 --> 03:00:18,060
Nice!

3643
03:00:18,520 --> 03:00:19,000
Let's go!

3644
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:19,320
Let's go!

3645
03:00:21,280 --> 03:00:21,640
Yay!

3646
03:00:23,120 --> 03:00:23,800
Holy shit.

3647
03:00:24,080 --> 03:00:25,420
Generational battle, generational battle.

3648
03:00:25,500 --> 03:00:26,320
We played that perfectly.

3649
03:00:29,840 --> 03:00:30,200
Generational.

3650
03:00:30,640 --> 03:00:31,400
I killed Igben.

3651
03:00:31,880 --> 03:00:33,320
I feel like I wasn't doing that much.

3652
03:00:34,320 --> 03:00:35,980
I mean, the arrows do a lot of damage.

3653
03:00:36,080 --> 03:00:38,200
I think it's just so much healing that it's hard, but you're farming damage points.

3654
03:00:38,220 --> 03:00:39,140
There's damage points in this, Hannah.

3655
03:00:39,220 --> 03:00:41,280
You're getting a million points from shooting people off.

3656
03:00:41,520 --> 03:00:43,340
Okay, so we're going to do the exact same thing.

3657
03:00:44,540 --> 03:00:44,620
Yeah.

3658
03:00:45,520 --> 03:00:47,100
Blue is really slow to get to the point.

3659
03:00:47,220 --> 03:00:49,660
The next team might be a little faster to try and contest this.

3660
03:00:49,780 --> 03:00:50,340
I don't know.

3661
03:00:50,420 --> 03:00:51,100
Are those multiplied?

3662
03:00:52,500 --> 03:00:53,420
The points already?

3663
03:00:53,600 --> 03:00:54,020
I don't know.

3664
03:00:54,460 --> 03:00:55,180
I feel like they are already.

3665
03:00:56,800 --> 03:00:57,720
I think they are.

3666
03:00:58,340 --> 03:00:59,680
Did I kill Everomi?

3667
03:01:01,420 --> 03:01:02,140
No, nothing.

3668
03:01:03,020 --> 03:01:03,740
Do you want to hang out?

3669
03:01:04,420 --> 03:01:05,320
Yeah, yeah.

3670
03:01:06,080 --> 03:01:06,440
Yay!

3671
03:01:08,460 --> 03:01:10,600
I was critting someone out and did nothing.

3672
03:01:11,380 --> 03:01:13,960
I'm telling you, the healing classes, it's so hard to kill them.

3673
03:01:13,960 --> 03:01:15,700
They just take so much.

3674
03:01:16,960 --> 03:01:19,960
Especially because if you have a fairy, you get permanent regen as well.

3675
03:01:20,120 --> 03:01:20,880
It's just so ridiculous.

3676
03:01:21,740 --> 03:01:21,960
Yeah.

3677
03:01:23,120 --> 03:01:24,880
Okay, so let's do the same exact thing.

3678
03:01:25,060 --> 03:01:26,180
Take the headshot shortcut.

3679
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:27,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3680
03:01:28,180 --> 03:01:28,580
Okay.

3681
03:01:31,700 --> 03:01:32,100
Yes.

3682
03:01:32,600 --> 03:01:34,040
Do I use it right away?

3683
03:01:34,220 --> 03:01:35,580
The splash absorption?

3684
03:01:35,920 --> 03:01:37,640
If people are fighting us, you can.

3685
03:01:39,380 --> 03:01:40,840
They're fighting us to try and...

3686
03:01:40,840 --> 03:01:42,160
They're going on the point.

3687
03:01:42,620 --> 03:01:43,720
Let's just go as fast as we can.

3688
03:01:44,940 --> 03:01:46,940
After this, we'll go to the middle.

3689
03:01:47,640 --> 03:01:49,080
I'll just shoot at them to make them go away.

3690
03:01:49,280 --> 03:01:50,060
Alright, they're going away.

3691
03:01:50,800 --> 03:01:51,920
After this, we're going to pulse the middle, okay?

3692
03:01:52,960 --> 03:01:53,220
Alright.

3693
03:01:54,820 --> 03:01:55,340
30 left.

3694
03:01:55,600 --> 03:01:56,420
Okay, I'll just shoot at them.

3695
03:01:56,780 --> 03:01:58,080
Go middle, go middle, go middle.

3696
03:01:58,240 --> 03:01:58,760
Go middle, go middle.

3697
03:02:00,500 --> 03:02:01,340
Look out for the void.

3698
03:02:01,400 --> 03:02:02,100
Be careful of the void again.

3699
03:02:02,200 --> 03:02:04,060
You have to go around the side here like this and then go on.

3700
03:02:06,440 --> 03:02:06,700
Alright.

3701
03:02:07,040 --> 03:02:07,840
I'll look around.

3702
03:02:08,380 --> 03:02:09,420
Up there on the bridge.

3703
03:02:10,300 --> 03:02:12,260
Once we have all the points, I think we go back where we came from.

3704
03:02:12,280 --> 03:02:13,160
I think we go back this way, guys.

3705
03:02:13,420 --> 03:02:14,380
Yeah, we go back where we came from.

3706
03:02:14,540 --> 03:02:18,020
Wait, everyone leave, everyone leave.

3707
03:02:18,200 --> 03:02:18,500
They're chasing.

3708
03:02:19,620 --> 03:02:20,400
Everyone come this way.

3709
03:02:22,420 --> 03:02:23,100
Purple is chasing.

3710
03:02:23,160 --> 03:02:23,880
Purple is chasing blue right now.

3711
03:02:23,920 --> 03:02:24,420
Purple is chasing blue.

3712
03:02:24,420 --> 03:02:26,120
Should we go behind purple, Hannah, or should we play safe?

3713
03:02:26,540 --> 03:02:27,320
No, wait.

3714
03:02:27,520 --> 03:02:30,080
I think we go back up there and just play our lives.

3715
03:02:30,180 --> 03:02:30,980
Let's go high ground again.

3716
03:02:31,500 --> 03:02:32,120
High ground is OP.

3717
03:02:32,800 --> 03:02:34,040
There's one person...

3718
03:02:34,040 --> 03:02:34,480
Wait, never mind.

3719
03:02:34,760 --> 03:02:35,340
Never mind, I'm an idiot.

3720
03:02:35,340 --> 03:02:36,000
I'm an idiot.

3721
03:02:37,040 --> 03:02:39,240
Look, there's a massive fight over there by yellow and red.

3722
03:02:39,320 --> 03:02:41,180
I don't know if we want to third party that or not, though.

3723
03:02:42,100 --> 03:02:43,060
Blue is behind us.

3724
03:02:43,520 --> 03:02:45,360
There's purple behind us.

3725
03:02:45,440 --> 03:02:46,420
There's purple behind us.

3726
03:02:46,520 --> 03:02:47,800
I think we have our spot and we should just play.

3727
03:02:47,940 --> 03:02:49,000
Purple is playing for kills right now.

3728
03:02:49,020 --> 03:02:49,720
Yeah, we have a good spot.

3729
03:02:49,780 --> 03:02:50,340
We have a good spot.

3730
03:02:51,200 --> 03:02:52,160
Let's just take our spot.

3731
03:02:52,920 --> 03:02:53,780
And I'll shoot a green.

3732
03:02:53,940 --> 03:02:55,840
Purple is just full playing for kills right now.

3733
03:02:57,020 --> 03:02:58,580
I don't think anybody can get behind us.

3734
03:02:58,800 --> 03:03:00,340
I think we're chill over here right now.

3735
03:03:00,480 --> 03:03:01,980
Maybe we can just spam.

3736
03:03:01,980 --> 03:03:02,940
Just spam like crazy.

3737
03:03:03,700 --> 03:03:04,980
There's purple to our left.

3738
03:03:05,180 --> 03:03:05,440
Careful.

3739
03:03:06,360 --> 03:03:07,020
Oh, pink.

3740
03:03:07,160 --> 03:03:07,880
Purple is annoying me.

3741
03:03:09,760 --> 03:03:11,200
Don't worry, I got heals.

3742
03:03:11,440 --> 03:03:11,940
There's green to our right.

3743
03:03:14,340 --> 03:03:15,140
Hannah, you're doing a lot of damage.

3744
03:03:15,300 --> 03:03:16,220
Your pink is under us right now.

3745
03:03:16,720 --> 03:03:17,600
Don't worry about pink.

3746
03:03:17,880 --> 03:03:18,640
I'm not concerned.

3747
03:03:18,820 --> 03:03:20,140
Hannah, you have damage boost if you move back a little bit.

3748
03:03:20,900 --> 03:03:22,560
Orange is shooting us.

3749
03:03:22,600 --> 03:03:24,820
I need a clear shot to orange.

3750
03:03:25,020 --> 03:03:26,240
Hannah, big fight to our side.

3751
03:03:26,300 --> 03:03:28,200
No, it's down under on the bottom.

3752
03:03:28,200 --> 03:03:28,580
Can you see that?

3753
03:03:29,320 --> 03:03:30,460
I don't know if it's worth it or not.

3754
03:03:31,060 --> 03:03:34,320
They're not fighting like that.

3755
03:03:34,480 --> 03:03:35,280
Red is under us.

3756
03:03:35,440 --> 03:03:36,340
Can I have a clear shot?

3757
03:03:37,720 --> 03:03:40,300
I'm going to kill Feinberg.

3758
03:03:41,280 --> 03:03:41,800
I'm chilling.

3759
03:03:43,620 --> 03:03:45,100
Taboo is totally under us at 9 HP.

3760
03:03:45,200 --> 03:03:47,200
Taboo is 9 HP under us right now.

3761
03:03:47,360 --> 03:03:48,580
No, not worth it.

3762
03:03:52,120 --> 03:03:53,120
We have the corner.

3763
03:03:53,800 --> 03:03:54,740
I'm dropping with you.

3764
03:03:54,740 --> 03:03:55,640
I think we have to.

3765
03:03:56,240 --> 03:03:57,320
Three of us stay up here.

3766
03:03:58,680 --> 03:03:59,480
I'm chilling.

3767
03:04:00,620 --> 03:04:01,980
I think just keep spamming pink.

3768
03:04:02,840 --> 03:04:04,820
We need to do better than pink.

3769
03:04:05,000 --> 03:04:06,400
Spam them with our abilities first.

3770
03:04:06,880 --> 03:04:07,780
Captain Sparkle is a solo.

3771
03:04:07,960 --> 03:04:08,840
You might want to kill him.

3772
03:04:11,900 --> 03:04:12,980
Don't go too far.

3773
03:04:13,340 --> 03:04:13,740
I'm coming in.

3774
03:04:13,920 --> 03:04:16,420
Let's sit up here.

3775
03:04:17,720 --> 03:04:18,980
I'm so chill up here.

3776
03:04:19,080 --> 03:04:19,940
I'm a chill guy.

3777
03:04:21,120 --> 03:04:22,120
We're going to get targeted.

3778
03:04:22,120 --> 03:04:23,120
Just chill.

3779
03:04:23,660 --> 03:04:24,640
I'm a chill guy.

3780
03:04:25,600 --> 03:04:26,880
I'm a chill guy.

3781
03:04:28,120 --> 03:04:29,540
How about pink is all of red?

3782
03:04:29,940 --> 03:04:30,920
Just a chill guy.

3783
03:04:33,980 --> 03:04:35,440
Is someone fighting us?

3784
03:04:35,760 --> 03:04:36,420
No, a spider.

3785
03:04:38,680 --> 03:04:39,820
I think we have to go down.

3786
03:04:39,940 --> 03:04:40,320
Let's go down.

3787
03:04:41,260 --> 03:04:42,060
Kill these spiders.

3788
03:04:45,020 --> 03:04:46,740
I don't know if we go for middle again.

3789
03:04:46,980 --> 03:04:48,220
We get rushed by everything.

3790
03:04:48,220 --> 03:04:50,240
We stay here.

3791
03:04:51,440 --> 03:04:52,220
Spam with your bow.

3792
03:04:57,760 --> 03:04:59,260
He absorbed us again.

3793
03:04:59,540 --> 03:05:01,100
I just threw it.

3794
03:05:01,180 --> 03:05:02,900
Do you have the healing totem?

3795
03:05:02,940 --> 03:05:03,560
Yeah, I have both.

3796
03:05:05,120 --> 03:05:06,620
We should go mid and damage.

3797
03:05:06,900 --> 03:05:07,740
Damage and start shooting.

3798
03:05:08,340 --> 03:05:08,800
Go.

3799
03:05:12,580 --> 03:05:13,040
Boom.

3800
03:05:13,840 --> 03:05:14,300
Boom.

3801
03:05:20,490 --> 03:05:21,090
Purple,

3802
03:05:24,330 --> 03:05:24,890
if you can.

3803
03:05:27,470 --> 03:05:29,050
Shadow, no shadow.

3804
03:05:33,110 --> 03:05:35,150
This is a lot of people.

3805
03:05:35,430 --> 03:05:36,210
No, she didn't get me.

3806
03:05:36,570 --> 03:05:37,950
We did good.

3807
03:05:38,290 --> 03:05:40,390
I wasn't getting any kills there.

3808
03:05:41,130 --> 03:05:42,310
We did good.

3809
03:05:43,230 --> 03:05:45,590
We have a lead by 500 points.

3810
03:05:45,590 --> 03:05:46,530
Now we are cooking.

3811
03:05:46,870 --> 03:05:48,070
We are going to do the same thing.

3812
03:05:49,150 --> 03:05:50,910
I was at one heart.

3813
03:05:51,750 --> 03:05:52,910
It is hard.

3814
03:05:53,470 --> 03:05:55,630
If we are the first team to go there, it is good.

3815
03:05:55,950 --> 03:05:57,230
The purple just chilled.

3816
03:05:58,190 --> 03:05:59,470
I saw purple chill.

3817
03:05:59,930 --> 03:06:02,510
Maybe we just rush purple in that situation.

3818
03:06:02,990 --> 03:06:04,830
Because the other two teams were fighting on the other side.

3819
03:06:05,610 --> 03:06:07,050
Yeah, I think you are right.

3820
03:06:07,150 --> 03:06:09,430
This is the OWL.

3821
03:06:10,850 --> 03:06:15,230
When you are at the bottom at mid, you can crit them upwards.

3822
03:06:15,230 --> 03:06:18,670
You can look at them up when they are on that platform and just crit them out.

3823
03:06:18,770 --> 03:06:20,490
They can't really do that to you.

3824
03:06:20,770 --> 03:06:22,090
Yeah, because they have a high ground advantage.

3825
03:06:23,710 --> 03:06:24,770
That is good.

3826
03:06:25,290 --> 03:06:27,870
I am lucky that orange ran into us.

3827
03:06:28,050 --> 03:06:29,070
And every other team did too.

3828
03:06:30,810 --> 03:06:32,010
I forgot to choose my kit.

3829
03:06:32,910 --> 03:06:34,370
You have 10 seconds.

3830
03:06:35,110 --> 03:06:36,890
I didn't realize the overtime thing.

3831
03:06:37,010 --> 03:06:38,250
I still had our healing totem.

3832
03:06:38,510 --> 03:06:39,830
That was probably a big difference.

3833
03:06:40,510 --> 03:06:41,250
I didn't use it.

3834
03:06:41,250 --> 03:06:43,210
I think it disappears in overtime.

3835
03:06:43,390 --> 03:06:44,390
I am not sure.

3836
03:06:44,730 --> 03:06:46,490
If it is on the ground, it might disappear.

3837
03:06:47,070 --> 03:06:48,030
It does.

3838
03:06:48,330 --> 03:06:51,130
I think we were half HP when it went to OT.

3839
03:06:51,430 --> 03:06:53,230
If I used it before, we would be full.

3840
03:06:53,710 --> 03:06:54,030
We got it.

3841
03:06:58,610 --> 03:07:00,410
Let's speedrun to our spot.

3842
03:07:02,790 --> 03:07:04,010
Is this purple?

3843
03:07:04,190 --> 03:07:04,710
Don't worry.

3844
03:07:04,770 --> 03:07:05,210
Just go.

3845
03:07:05,850 --> 03:07:06,170
Place them.

3846
03:07:08,070 --> 03:07:09,470
Everyone come close together.

3847
03:07:10,770 --> 03:07:14,690
I put absorption just in case.

3848
03:07:19,330 --> 03:07:21,230
They broke it.

3849
03:07:22,790 --> 03:07:24,050
Wait for the point.

3850
03:07:25,350 --> 03:07:26,410
They are pretty low.

3851
03:07:26,750 --> 03:07:27,590
We got it.

3852
03:07:27,790 --> 03:07:28,190
They are leaving.

3853
03:07:30,950 --> 03:07:31,710
Nice.

3854
03:07:32,170 --> 03:07:32,470
Good work.

3855
03:07:32,850 --> 03:07:33,550
Should we push?

3856
03:07:34,690 --> 03:07:36,410
Let's go middle.

3857
03:07:36,870 --> 03:07:38,630
I used all my resources.

3858
03:07:38,970 --> 03:07:40,270
Yellow is on it.

3859
03:07:41,070 --> 03:07:42,110
Purple is going for it.

3860
03:07:42,750 --> 03:07:44,050
Yellow is on it right now.

3861
03:07:44,750 --> 03:07:45,630
Let them have it.

3862
03:07:45,790 --> 03:07:46,930
Yellow is low.

3863
03:07:48,730 --> 03:07:50,290
Do we want to fight more?

3864
03:07:50,430 --> 03:07:51,230
We are winning.

3865
03:07:51,710 --> 03:07:54,510
I used up all my resources for that.

3866
03:07:55,290 --> 03:07:56,290
It was worth it.

3867
03:07:56,290 --> 03:07:56,670
That was good.

3868
03:07:58,130 --> 03:07:59,510
Let's do the same.

3869
03:07:59,550 --> 03:08:00,130
We are winning right now.

3870
03:08:00,210 --> 03:08:01,030
We don't need to throw that away.

3871
03:08:03,430 --> 03:08:05,190
We can risk it for the biscuit.

3872
03:08:05,310 --> 03:08:06,730
Behind us.

3873
03:08:06,730 --> 03:08:08,110
Lime only has two.

3874
03:08:08,310 --> 03:08:08,990
Let's kill them.

3875
03:08:09,110 --> 03:08:12,430
Kill this person in the border.

3876
03:08:12,770 --> 03:08:14,210
I didn't get it.

3877
03:08:16,070 --> 03:08:16,810
Let's stay up.

3878
03:08:17,590 --> 03:08:18,250
I think we should stay up.

3879
03:08:18,570 --> 03:08:23,950
If we see a full team fight going on with red and yellow, maybe we can push that.

3880
03:08:24,730 --> 03:08:25,570
Yellow is winning.

3881
03:08:27,930 --> 03:08:29,470
There are a bunch of minions.

3882
03:08:30,030 --> 03:08:31,490
There is a summoner.

3883
03:08:31,490 --> 03:08:31,690
Oh yeah.

3884
03:08:34,870 --> 03:08:36,350
I'm trying to shoot them.

3885
03:08:38,770 --> 03:08:40,710
There is a lime hiding under the bridge.

3886
03:08:40,730 --> 03:08:41,990
There is a red hiding under us.

3887
03:08:42,830 --> 03:08:43,570
We can shoot him.

3888
03:08:45,610 --> 03:08:48,190
We should go down to Hannah.

3889
03:08:48,930 --> 03:08:50,050
I think she will be fine.

3890
03:08:50,630 --> 03:08:51,370
I'm so sorry.

3891
03:08:51,450 --> 03:08:52,050
I didn't mean to fall.

3892
03:08:52,670 --> 03:08:54,410
There is a lot of people below.

3893
03:08:54,990 --> 03:08:56,450
They can come to the water here.

3894
03:08:56,710 --> 03:08:57,590
Ant, please come here.

3895
03:08:58,450 --> 03:08:59,770
Pink is not going to do anything to us.

3896
03:08:59,870 --> 03:09:00,570
They are going to chill.

3897
03:09:01,250 --> 03:09:02,430
I feel like we can just kill pink.

3898
03:09:02,890 --> 03:09:03,570
Maybe I'm wrong.

3899
03:09:07,190 --> 03:09:08,670
There is yellow hiding.

3900
03:09:10,910 --> 03:09:11,930
Purple is a team of three.

3901
03:09:12,490 --> 03:09:13,290
I think we can't go under them.

3902
03:09:13,890 --> 03:09:14,910
I think we should mess with them.

3903
03:09:15,250 --> 03:09:16,530
They are shooting purple.

3904
03:09:16,770 --> 03:09:20,250
There is two yellows there.

3905
03:09:20,690 --> 03:09:21,890
Yellow is coming to us.

3906
03:09:22,770 --> 03:09:24,170
Yellow wants to come to us.

3907
03:09:29,590 --> 03:09:33,730
They are going to have to come down.

3908
03:09:35,530 --> 03:09:37,570
Kill the mobs.

3909
03:09:39,790 --> 03:09:41,070
Purple is at five.

3910
03:09:41,110 --> 03:09:41,630
We should push.

3911
03:09:44,410 --> 03:09:45,050
Be careful.

3912
03:09:45,210 --> 03:09:46,330
Don't get too aggressive.

3913
03:09:46,470 --> 03:09:46,810
We are going to get killed.

3914
03:09:48,550 --> 03:09:49,670
Let's kill purple.

3915
03:09:50,830 --> 03:09:51,830
Oh my god.

3916
03:09:53,290 --> 03:09:54,150
I'm not with you guys.

3917
03:09:54,150 --> 03:09:54,910
Guys, no.

3918
03:09:55,230 --> 03:09:57,430
I think we got too aggressive on purple.

3919
03:09:58,270 --> 03:09:59,590
All of orange is on you.

3920
03:09:59,750 --> 03:10:00,590
They are targeting us.

3921
03:10:01,650 --> 03:10:02,090
You can go middle.

3922
03:10:03,870 --> 03:10:05,450
They are all on us.

3923
03:10:06,510 --> 03:10:06,790
Go middle.

3924
03:10:08,310 --> 03:10:09,190
One blue on you.

3925
03:10:10,530 --> 03:10:11,730
You can go middle.

3926
03:10:12,130 --> 03:10:13,150
Do you have any heals?

3927
03:10:14,390 --> 03:10:15,670
I'm waiting for heals now.

3928
03:10:16,010 --> 03:10:16,830
I'm waiting for two.

3929
03:10:17,990 --> 03:10:18,610
You guys are fine.

3930
03:10:18,630 --> 03:10:19,230
Just kill the mobs.

3931
03:10:19,230 --> 03:10:21,470
Kill the mobs.

3932
03:10:21,470 --> 03:10:22,510
Get ready.

3933
03:10:23,330 --> 03:10:24,170
On you, green player.

3934
03:10:25,730 --> 03:10:26,350
On hannah.

3935
03:10:27,250 --> 03:10:29,430
I'm trying to keep her alive.

3936
03:10:29,850 --> 03:10:30,110
Good kill.

3937
03:10:31,670 --> 03:10:32,670
Yellow on you.

3938
03:10:32,930 --> 03:10:33,730
They went back.

3939
03:10:35,210 --> 03:10:37,230
Honestly, just play for...

3940
03:10:37,230 --> 03:10:37,730
I don't even know.

3941
03:10:37,810 --> 03:10:38,290
Orange is split.

3942
03:10:40,090 --> 03:10:42,510
I have heals in two or three, I think.

3943
03:10:44,110 --> 03:10:45,530
They are going to mosh.

3944
03:10:46,070 --> 03:10:47,330
They are going to mosh soon.

3945
03:10:47,330 --> 03:10:48,510
Help hannah.

3946
03:10:49,070 --> 03:10:49,610
Help hannah on orange.

3947
03:10:52,250 --> 03:10:53,170
Fruits on you.

3948
03:10:53,690 --> 03:10:54,450
You got yours.

3949
03:10:54,730 --> 03:10:57,050
Oh my god.

3950
03:10:57,430 --> 03:10:58,270
The mosh pit.

3951
03:11:00,010 --> 03:11:01,150
You got yours.

3952
03:11:01,830 --> 03:11:03,430
Honestly, I'm fine.

3953
03:11:03,810 --> 03:11:04,630
Look at the gap.

3954
03:11:05,950 --> 03:11:06,990
Holy shit.

3955
03:11:07,910 --> 03:11:09,470
We are moshing.

3956
03:11:09,490 --> 03:11:10,750
We just gapped by a thousand.

3957
03:11:13,770 --> 03:11:14,890
Holy shit.

3958
03:11:15,670 --> 03:11:16,950
Holy shit.

3959
03:11:16,950 --> 03:11:18,290
That was really good.

3960
03:11:18,910 --> 03:11:19,670
That was incredible.

3961
03:11:20,170 --> 03:11:21,650
I told you.

3962
03:11:24,750 --> 03:11:27,310
You didn't believe me.

3963
03:11:31,150 --> 03:11:32,070
Let's go.

3964
03:11:33,670 --> 03:11:34,950
I got first.

3965
03:11:35,050 --> 03:11:35,650
I'm taking a screenshot.

3966
03:11:36,590 --> 03:11:37,370
Oh, I'm third.

3967
03:11:37,510 --> 03:11:38,130
Let's go.

3968
03:11:38,330 --> 03:11:39,910
Give me third.

3969
03:11:40,790 --> 03:11:41,710
Oh my god.

3970
03:11:41,710 --> 03:11:43,330
I think I'm going to go that river.

3971
03:11:43,570 --> 03:11:44,510
That's my wife.

3972
03:11:52,290 --> 03:11:54,670
You can literally be Sonic's wife.

3973
03:11:55,530 --> 03:11:56,110
Oh my god.

3974
03:11:59,170 --> 03:12:00,950
Blitzhunt is going to be hard, but we can do it.

3975
03:12:01,050 --> 03:12:02,850
We have to have a historic Blitzhunt.

3976
03:12:03,510 --> 03:12:04,830
We have to lock into Blitzhunt.

3977
03:12:05,950 --> 03:12:08,370
We closed that gap really, really, really well.

3978
03:12:34,350 --> 03:12:36,250
Let's go.

3979
03:12:36,270 --> 03:12:38,090
Let's go.

3980
03:12:38,090 --> 03:12:40,390
You have to find a really good hidey spot.

3981
03:12:42,590 --> 03:12:44,270
Wait, we shouldn't stick together.

3982
03:12:46,230 --> 03:12:47,390
Oh my god, wait, wait.

3983
03:12:47,650 --> 03:12:49,070
I'm going to get camouflage skin.

3984
03:12:49,830 --> 03:12:50,730
Oh, you're so right.

3985
03:12:53,470 --> 03:12:55,430
Hurry, find a dirt block.

3986
03:12:55,510 --> 03:12:56,290
Oh my god, you're right.

3987
03:12:56,430 --> 03:12:57,050
Give me a sec.

3988
03:12:57,110 --> 03:12:57,890
I have two minutes.

3989
03:12:58,370 --> 03:12:59,250
I'll be right back.

3990
03:13:05,630 --> 03:13:06,430
Oh my god.

3991
03:13:06,470 --> 03:13:07,330
Oh my god, you're so right.

3992
03:13:12,090 --> 03:13:13,790
Wait, what's a good dirt block?

3993
03:13:13,950 --> 03:13:16,990
Oh, I found a really good one.

3994
03:13:17,450 --> 03:13:19,510
She said, what's a good dirt block?

3995
03:13:23,870 --> 03:13:25,670
We're metagaming, boys.

3996
03:13:27,590 --> 03:13:30,770
And before, like, this is the worst I've ever done in Blitz.

3997
03:13:40,000 --> 03:13:41,180
I used to have a skin.

3998
03:13:41,720 --> 03:13:42,540
Oh, there it is.

3999
03:13:42,580 --> 03:13:42,900
Oh my god.

4000
03:13:43,040 --> 03:13:46,500
Do people ever, like, go into rooms together?

4001
03:13:47,540 --> 03:13:48,280
Like, as a team?

4002
03:13:48,700 --> 03:13:49,180
As a duo?

4003
03:13:50,160 --> 03:13:51,160
Um, you can.

4004
03:13:51,400 --> 03:13:55,500
If you know of a good spot, like, you see a room and it's a really good spot, you can go to play together.

4005
03:13:55,500 --> 03:13:56,740
Yeah, there's some really crazy spots.

4006
03:13:56,740 --> 03:13:57,580
Oh, no, I mean hunting.

4007
03:13:58,760 --> 03:14:00,680
Oh, yeah, no, you can definitely do that.

4008
03:14:00,800 --> 03:14:02,120
I mean, I think it's, like, not bad at all.

4009
03:14:02,120 --> 03:14:03,500
Especially if, like, people are...

4010
03:14:03,500 --> 03:14:07,500
Like, if I'm going on a roof to get people off of it, who's under and just killing people, I think it works fine.

4011
03:14:08,660 --> 03:14:10,340
Um, I don't think it's good to recheck middle.

4012
03:14:10,420 --> 03:14:11,500
A lot of people like to go to middle.

4013
03:14:22,700 --> 03:14:23,760
They'll never know.

4014
03:14:24,880 --> 03:14:26,120
They'll never know.

4015
03:14:28,380 --> 03:14:30,220
Wait, how did you find a full dirt?

4016
03:14:30,220 --> 03:14:31,760
Okay, well, I didn't find a dirt.

4017
03:14:31,940 --> 03:14:33,460
I can just stand like this.

4018
03:14:33,540 --> 03:14:35,400
And it's like a part of the structure.

4019
03:14:39,320 --> 03:14:40,480
I have hair.

4020
03:14:41,700 --> 03:14:43,180
Wait, why are you a penguin?

4021
03:14:43,700 --> 03:14:46,020
I just thought I would be really cool.

4022
03:14:46,280 --> 03:14:47,660
Wait, God, there's a snow area.

4023
03:14:47,760 --> 03:14:48,340
There's a snow area.

4024
03:14:48,480 --> 03:14:50,340
You should be a penguin right in.

4025
03:14:52,520 --> 03:14:56,100
Wait, Doki, what if it's Christmas themed and there's snow instead of dirt?

4026
03:14:56,440 --> 03:14:57,780
Oh, that's true!

4027
03:14:57,780 --> 03:14:59,340
It's so fun!

4028
03:14:59,560 --> 03:15:00,680
Oh my God, do we look for it?

4029
03:15:00,800 --> 03:15:02,220
We don't have time!

4030
03:15:02,460 --> 03:15:04,100
It's so fun!

4031
03:15:05,460 --> 03:15:06,620
They heard us.

4032
03:15:06,940 --> 03:15:08,460
Oh, we'll find out.

4033
03:15:09,000 --> 03:15:11,420
That was a generational battle.

4034
03:15:11,780 --> 03:15:13,120
Two people are gonna like...

4035
03:15:13,560 --> 03:15:16,940
This is a pro lobby, so they're gonna be F5ing it, aren't they?

4036
03:15:17,820 --> 03:15:18,080
Probably.

4037
03:15:19,240 --> 03:15:21,620
You can make your F5 something easier to click.

4038
03:15:22,360 --> 03:15:23,800
No, but like...

4039
03:15:23,800 --> 03:15:27,440
That means I can't do the spots I like, cause they'll see it.

4040
03:15:27,500 --> 03:15:29,600
I see what you mean.

4041
03:15:29,820 --> 03:15:30,560
Wait, F5?

4042
03:15:31,000 --> 03:15:35,580
They'll have me in third person, so they'll see it's easier to find people.

4043
03:15:36,760 --> 03:15:37,620
They'll know.

4044
03:15:43,460 --> 03:15:45,380
There's a misplaced block.

4045
03:15:48,680 --> 03:15:50,640
Oh, we're finding everything.

4046
03:15:51,160 --> 03:15:52,620
Are we hunting?

4047
03:15:53,140 --> 03:15:56,900
Honestly, this is fine, because people are gonna be less practiced and less warmed up.

4048
03:15:57,040 --> 03:15:57,940
They're not gonna move as much.

4049
03:15:58,540 --> 03:16:03,700
Guys, you run around and you just sprint...

4050
03:16:03,700 --> 03:16:05,460
Sorry, what am I even trying to say?

4051
03:16:06,160 --> 03:16:07,620
You can spam click them.

4052
03:16:12,600 --> 03:16:14,760
Are they disguised as blocks?

4053
03:16:15,120 --> 03:16:15,520
No, no.

4054
03:16:16,480 --> 03:16:17,760
They're not like us.

4055
03:16:19,460 --> 03:16:22,660
Hunters have a sonar to show the amount of hiders nearby.

4056
03:16:23,140 --> 03:16:25,540
Yeah, but it's a long cooldown, so like...

4057
03:16:27,200 --> 03:16:32,940
So, there are some rooms that are easier to find people than others, but people are moving around at all times, and so it's in a circle around the center.

4058
03:16:33,080 --> 03:16:33,440
Does that make sense?

4059
03:16:33,880 --> 03:16:35,480
We should all go in different directions.

4060
03:16:35,800 --> 03:16:39,740
It's one room in the middle, and then every room around it is a giant loop you can do.

4061
03:16:40,360 --> 03:16:41,700
Yeah, we should all go different directions.

4062
03:16:41,780 --> 03:16:46,780
It is not a bad idea to check middle again.

4063
03:16:46,960 --> 03:16:49,820
There's some places you can hide at middle later on.

4064
03:16:50,020 --> 03:16:51,800
The sonar you get will tell you...

4065
03:16:51,800 --> 03:16:53,180
I think it's roughly 10-20 blocks.

4066
03:16:53,440 --> 03:16:54,520
I'm going east.

4067
03:16:55,840 --> 03:16:56,660
I'm going left.

4068
03:16:56,700 --> 03:17:00,020
People don't know what direction you're going, because they'll decide based on who goes where.

4069
03:17:00,120 --> 03:17:00,600
Does that make sense?

4070
03:17:01,620 --> 03:17:04,000
Like, if someone's good...

4071
03:17:04,000 --> 03:17:04,540
Do you know what I mean?

4072
03:17:05,720 --> 03:17:07,240
I'm going the other way.

4073
03:17:07,760 --> 03:17:09,620
Try hard, Dirt Master!

4074
03:17:13,700 --> 03:17:15,460
We thought it was funny!

4075
03:17:15,460 --> 03:17:18,900
We just thought it was funny!

4076
03:17:22,140 --> 03:17:26,260
We just thought it was funny!

4077
03:17:37,280 --> 03:17:39,060
I want to win for charity.

4078
03:17:39,300 --> 03:17:42,700
I want to be the one to donate to Minecraft charity.

4079
03:17:43,480 --> 03:17:44,960
I want it to be us.

4080
03:17:46,720 --> 03:17:48,560
I'm the mascot.

4081
03:17:49,740 --> 03:17:50,960
I call west.

4082
03:17:51,060 --> 03:17:51,960
I call west.

4083
03:17:53,140 --> 03:17:55,640
Okay, I'm gonna go north, actually.

4084
03:17:56,600 --> 03:17:58,420
Doki, you should go west with me.

4085
03:17:58,820 --> 03:18:00,240
No, we gotta split it up.

4086
03:18:01,500 --> 03:18:02,740
There's only four.

4087
03:18:03,000 --> 03:18:03,880
Wait, but who's gonna go north?

4088
03:18:04,240 --> 03:18:05,120
I'm going north.

4089
03:18:05,260 --> 03:18:06,940
Okay, west.

4090
03:18:09,540 --> 03:18:12,400
It says I'll go east, don't worry.

4091
03:18:12,720 --> 03:18:14,580
Yeah, I'll go north.

4092
03:18:14,880 --> 03:18:17,980
Sorry, I was trying to troll them and make it look like I wasn't going north.

4093
03:18:17,980 --> 03:18:19,000
Just check corners.

4094
03:18:19,320 --> 03:18:21,380
I would say people will try to loop around things.

4095
03:18:21,500 --> 03:18:24,560
Make sure to remember to check and watch for that or try to loop around yourself a couple times.

4096
03:18:24,980 --> 03:18:25,300
Alright, cool.

4097
03:18:26,720 --> 03:18:28,020
I don't know if anyone's gonna hide in spawn off.

4098
03:18:28,760 --> 03:18:29,160
No, they're not.

4099
03:18:29,260 --> 03:18:31,840
No one's hiding in spawn off rip, don't worry.

4100
03:18:32,760 --> 03:18:33,080
Unless...

4101
03:18:34,340 --> 03:18:35,640
Oh, it's the city thing.

4102
03:18:35,880 --> 03:18:36,200
Interesting.

4103
03:18:38,400 --> 03:18:38,900
Oh.

4104
03:18:39,720 --> 03:18:40,220
Okay.

4105
03:18:42,220 --> 03:18:43,260
Is there anyone here?

4106
03:18:43,260 --> 03:18:44,260
No players here.

4107
03:18:46,240 --> 03:18:48,100
They won't know I'm a dirt block.

4108
03:18:48,300 --> 03:18:48,560
I'm so sorry.

4109
03:18:51,040 --> 03:18:53,060
Yeah, I see them.

4110
03:18:57,010 --> 03:18:58,010
They're parkouring.

4111
03:18:58,530 --> 03:18:59,770
They know I can't parkour.

4112
03:18:59,770 --> 03:19:01,430
Why did you come the same way as me?

4113
03:19:01,930 --> 03:19:03,410
We're supposed to split up.

4114
03:19:04,090 --> 03:19:05,010
Zero players in here.

4115
03:19:06,390 --> 03:19:07,790
How do they keep disappearing?

4116
03:19:08,430 --> 03:19:13,510
Oh my god, they're so good.

4117
03:19:16,870 --> 03:19:18,470
Maybe I shouldn't chase the minecrafters.

4118
03:19:24,530 --> 03:19:25,610
I'm not doing well.

4119
03:19:28,930 --> 03:19:30,510
Nobody in middle right now that I can see.

4120
03:19:35,250 --> 03:19:36,990
I think I'm in these corner spots.

4121
03:19:37,410 --> 03:19:38,690
Yeah, I'm not doing well.

4122
03:19:38,690 --> 03:19:39,510
Oh, hey.

4123
03:19:40,390 --> 03:19:41,750
I saw someone here.

4124
03:19:42,410 --> 03:19:45,450
There's someone in this room.

4125
03:19:45,730 --> 03:19:47,750
I just saw someone, but I don't know where they went.

4126
03:19:48,470 --> 03:19:49,670
You just move on.

4127
03:19:49,910 --> 03:19:51,050
There's only three mid.

4128
03:19:53,610 --> 03:19:55,070
There's three people here.

4129
03:19:55,270 --> 03:19:55,770
Oh, okay.

4130
03:19:57,130 --> 03:19:57,650
Doctor!

4131
03:19:57,790 --> 03:19:58,770
Oh wait, that's not Dr. Eggman.

4132
03:19:58,850 --> 03:19:59,270
That's fine.

4133
03:20:00,410 --> 03:20:01,030
He can live.

4134
03:20:02,330 --> 03:20:04,050
I just did so bad.

4135
03:20:04,430 --> 03:20:05,210
I got four.

4136
03:20:05,210 --> 03:20:05,270
It's okay.

4137
03:20:06,110 --> 03:20:07,490
I got two.

4138
03:20:09,270 --> 03:20:11,050
Doki, look for the dirt.

4139
03:20:11,590 --> 03:20:12,610
Oh, look for dirt.

4140
03:20:12,730 --> 03:20:13,730
We gotta look for dirt.

4141
03:20:14,410 --> 03:20:16,570
No, there is.

4142
03:20:21,030 --> 03:20:22,290
I don't like any of these.

4143
03:20:22,370 --> 03:20:23,630
This lava room is not a cook.

4144
03:20:25,550 --> 03:20:28,330
You can go to the corner, but I would not sit in the lava room.

4145
03:20:29,790 --> 03:20:31,410
Okay, but what if I'm here?

4146
03:20:31,410 --> 03:20:33,830
Oh, this room looks abysmal.

4147
03:20:34,470 --> 03:20:35,790
This is a bad room.

4148
03:20:41,480 --> 03:20:42,780
Wait, this room is horrible.

4149
03:20:43,660 --> 03:20:45,760
Do we have to shift to hide our names or no?

4150
03:20:46,000 --> 03:20:46,400
No.

4151
03:20:50,170 --> 03:20:52,130
I might be dead off rip.

4152
03:20:53,650 --> 03:20:55,150
I feel like I'm dead off rip.

4153
03:20:55,570 --> 03:20:58,470
I'm a dirt block in a fucking ice area.

4154
03:21:02,210 --> 03:21:04,150
I'm a dirt block on the roof.

4155
03:21:04,150 --> 03:21:05,750
No, why did that person fall?

4156
03:21:05,830 --> 03:21:06,790
Oh my god.

4157
03:21:06,990 --> 03:21:08,250
I thought they were on me.

4158
03:21:08,810 --> 03:21:09,670
How do you get up to where 5-Up is?

4159
03:21:09,750 --> 03:21:10,110
I'm so confused.

4160
03:21:10,730 --> 03:21:11,950
The water tower, right?

4161
03:21:12,150 --> 03:21:12,310
No.

4162
03:21:13,110 --> 03:21:14,890
Oh, do you have to go to the mushroom?

4163
03:21:15,430 --> 03:21:16,210
Can you spec me?

4164
03:21:17,990 --> 03:21:18,090
Oh.

4165
03:21:19,750 --> 03:21:20,430
Yeah, I can't get you.

4166
03:21:20,530 --> 03:21:20,590
Hold on.

4167
03:21:22,350 --> 03:21:25,410
Oh, this is a hard room to run in, but I think you'll be fine.

4168
03:21:26,350 --> 03:21:27,110
Somebody's coming in now.

4169
03:21:28,970 --> 03:21:29,410
They're leaving.

4170
03:21:30,710 --> 03:21:31,530
It's one of the weaker players.

4171
03:21:31,590 --> 03:21:31,850
You're fine.

4172
03:21:34,310 --> 03:21:36,150
Wait, they can hear heartbeats now?

4173
03:21:38,310 --> 03:21:39,210
They're on the bottom right now, Hannah.

4174
03:21:39,450 --> 03:21:41,910
They didn't see you.

4175
03:21:42,150 --> 03:21:44,050
You can go back to the spot if you want.

4176
03:21:47,090 --> 03:21:48,650
I feel like this spot isn't horrible.

4177
03:21:49,570 --> 03:21:50,310
No, it's pretty good.

4178
03:21:53,230 --> 03:21:53,510
Um...

4179
03:21:53,510 --> 03:21:54,470
I would say play...

4180
03:21:54,470 --> 03:21:55,710
Is there a jump pad across to you?

4181
03:21:55,910 --> 03:21:59,050
They can jump pad to you, so I'll tell you if somebody's going up to you, I guess.

4182
03:21:59,350 --> 03:21:59,870
No, you're fine.

4183
03:22:01,510 --> 03:22:02,490
Try jump pad away.

4184
03:22:02,930 --> 03:22:04,090
Oh, you could.

4185
03:22:04,650 --> 03:22:06,250
Oh my god, this is so scary.

4186
03:22:06,910 --> 03:22:07,510
It is.

4187
03:22:08,010 --> 03:22:10,550
Literally, all of you are going to live if you have eight seconds.

4188
03:22:13,630 --> 03:22:16,870
I'm brown and I'm blended in the room.

4189
03:22:19,590 --> 03:22:20,870
We need this.

4190
03:22:20,910 --> 03:22:21,710
This is really good.

4191
03:22:22,230 --> 03:22:22,810
It's really good.

4192
03:22:22,930 --> 03:22:23,370
Awesome.

4193
03:22:23,850 --> 03:22:24,550
That was amazing.

4194
03:22:25,010 --> 03:22:25,450
Good round.

4195
03:22:26,090 --> 03:22:28,370
Hannah, this paint room is really good.

4196
03:22:28,650 --> 03:22:28,650
I need brown.

4197
03:22:28,650 --> 03:22:29,510
I need a blend in.

4198
03:22:29,510 --> 03:22:30,510
Okay, okay.

4199
03:22:30,590 --> 03:22:31,410
I'll go back into it.

4200
03:22:31,510 --> 03:22:32,290
I'll come back.

4201
03:22:33,110 --> 03:22:34,430
I need a deep brown.

4202
03:22:35,570 --> 03:22:36,410
Amazing, amazing.

4203
03:22:37,270 --> 03:22:38,690
Sorry I'm taking this so serious.

4204
03:22:38,930 --> 03:22:40,390
I just want to do it well.

4205
03:22:42,270 --> 03:22:42,930
I'm just okay.

4206
03:22:43,190 --> 03:22:43,950
That was a great round.

4207
03:22:43,990 --> 03:22:45,070
That was an amazing round for us.

4208
03:22:45,070 --> 03:22:49,350
Oh, it's this goofy sand map where they took away my skip.

4209
03:22:49,570 --> 03:22:49,890
I don't know.

4210
03:22:50,950 --> 03:22:53,290
Guys, I might...

4211
03:22:53,290 --> 03:22:54,410
I might be dead.

4212
03:22:57,730 --> 03:22:58,130
Guys.

4213
03:22:58,130 --> 03:22:58,410
I'm dead.

4214
03:22:59,270 --> 03:23:00,210
I think I'm dead.

4215
03:23:00,230 --> 03:23:00,950
No, no, no, no.

4216
03:23:01,110 --> 03:23:02,030
No, guys, guys, guys.

4217
03:23:02,130 --> 03:23:03,790
I have green on my head.

4218
03:23:03,970 --> 03:23:05,770
I didn't have the full dirt skin.

4219
03:23:06,190 --> 03:23:06,850
Don't worry, don't worry.

4220
03:23:07,190 --> 03:23:09,410
Try to find a spot where you're just hidden.

4221
03:23:10,750 --> 03:23:11,450
And we'll be fine.

4222
03:23:12,710 --> 03:23:14,450
Okay, can this person next to me stop trolling?

4223
03:23:14,550 --> 03:23:15,390
Oh my god.

4224
03:23:15,510 --> 03:23:15,930
Okay, sorry.

4225
03:23:16,250 --> 03:23:16,930
It's gonna keep trolling.

4226
03:23:18,430 --> 03:23:19,230
Goodbye, world.

4227
03:23:21,490 --> 03:23:23,130
There's four of us in this corner.

4228
03:23:24,090 --> 03:23:26,130
Purple was found by Feinberg first.

4229
03:23:28,190 --> 03:23:30,290
See you on the other side.

4230
03:23:31,170 --> 03:23:35,730
I won't be caught so I don't have to feel stressed anymore.

4231
03:23:36,510 --> 03:23:38,770
Oh, why is there so so much?

4232
03:23:40,490 --> 03:23:41,670
I want you to survive.

4233
03:23:44,450 --> 03:23:46,170
Take me out of my misery.

4234
03:23:46,710 --> 03:23:48,390
This paint room isn't that bad.

4235
03:23:48,630 --> 03:23:49,950
I'm aging 20 years.

4236
03:23:50,070 --> 03:23:50,430
Goodbye.

4237
03:23:53,290 --> 03:23:54,590
Uh, who's that?

4238
03:23:54,770 --> 03:23:55,810
I'm in the paint room.

4239
03:23:59,250 --> 03:24:01,250
This is actually not even a bad spot, I think.

4240
03:24:01,990 --> 03:24:04,710
This actually might be the most Mickey spot I've ever seen but it might work.

4241
03:24:09,630 --> 03:24:10,730
I hate this.

4242
03:24:13,030 --> 03:24:13,770
Come on, guys.

4243
03:24:13,850 --> 03:24:14,270
Stay alive.

4244
03:24:14,350 --> 03:24:14,750
You got this.

4245
03:24:16,950 --> 03:24:18,530
Get me out of here.

4246
03:24:18,850 --> 03:24:19,510
Thank you so much.

4247
03:24:19,950 --> 03:24:21,270
I'm one with nature.

4248
03:24:22,170 --> 03:24:23,710
Get me out of here.

4249
03:24:23,910 --> 03:24:24,350
Get me out!

4250
03:24:24,350 --> 03:24:25,350
SK, look at me.

4251
03:24:25,430 --> 03:24:28,010
SK, I have not moved from this spot once.

4252
03:24:28,690 --> 03:24:29,810
How do I find you?

4253
03:24:30,510 --> 03:24:31,290
I'm alive.

4254
03:24:32,430 --> 03:24:34,550
We're doing so good.

4255
03:24:35,250 --> 03:24:35,950
Oh my god.

4256
03:24:36,230 --> 03:24:37,070
SK died.

4257
03:24:37,210 --> 03:24:37,710
What do you mean?

4258
03:24:38,590 --> 03:24:39,510
SK died.

4259
03:24:39,630 --> 03:24:40,130
What do you mean?

4260
03:24:40,770 --> 03:24:43,490
We all lived.

4261
03:24:43,850 --> 03:24:45,110
SK eliminated.

4262
03:24:49,190 --> 03:24:49,830
That's fucked.

4263
03:24:50,390 --> 03:24:51,590
Sometimes you're going to die.

4264
03:24:51,750 --> 03:24:52,310
It's not your fault.

4265
03:24:54,350 --> 03:24:54,910
It's not your fault.

4266
03:24:56,830 --> 03:24:58,510
This room looks kind of weird, Ant.

4267
03:24:58,790 --> 03:24:59,990
I don't know about this room.

4268
03:25:00,350 --> 03:25:01,350
The sand room is trolled.

4269
03:25:01,370 --> 03:25:02,370
You're not going to the sand room.

4270
03:25:03,010 --> 03:25:04,030
It's the tree room.

4271
03:25:04,190 --> 03:25:05,710
This tree room is OP as hell.

4272
03:25:06,530 --> 03:25:07,870
I think I fucked up.

4273
03:25:08,190 --> 03:25:08,810
Oh no.

4274
03:25:09,130 --> 03:25:12,510
I found my spot.

4275
03:25:13,330 --> 03:25:14,190
The generational spot.

4276
03:25:14,210 --> 03:25:14,750
I don't have a spot.

4277
03:25:14,830 --> 03:25:15,190
I don't have a spot.

4278
03:25:15,730 --> 03:25:16,370
Me too.

4279
03:25:18,410 --> 03:25:20,250
Sorry, I can't tell you the direction.

4280
03:25:21,290 --> 03:25:22,410
Tree room in one of the corners.

4281
03:25:22,410 --> 03:25:23,150
Goodbye.

4282
03:25:25,770 --> 03:25:26,970
Please remember me.

4283
03:25:26,970 --> 03:25:28,470
This is such a bad spot to be in.

4284
03:25:29,970 --> 03:25:31,270
Please remember me.

4285
03:25:32,310 --> 03:25:33,190
It's over.

4286
03:25:35,230 --> 03:25:37,290
But I'll grab us two points just in case.

4287
03:25:38,310 --> 03:25:40,150
Wait, chat, do I have to go somewhere else?

4288
03:25:41,010 --> 03:25:41,950
Or is this the spot?

4289
03:25:44,270 --> 03:25:47,450
Okay, guys, but I can grab us two points.

4290
03:25:47,690 --> 03:25:50,730
You're safe, you're safe, but don't come here.

4291
03:25:51,310 --> 03:25:53,050
You're so fucking mean.

4292
03:25:53,190 --> 03:25:54,430
Who's inside of you?

4293
03:25:54,630 --> 03:25:56,970
If they're coming, I'm going to leave them away, okay?

4294
03:25:57,250 --> 03:26:00,170
Okay, and then I'm totally blending in.

4295
03:26:02,130 --> 03:26:05,750
If anybody will blend in, it's definitely me.

4296
03:26:07,110 --> 03:26:09,790
Dude, I'm literally in an ice area.

4297
03:26:11,010 --> 03:26:12,510
I'm against grey.

4298
03:26:17,540 --> 03:26:17,720
No.

4299
03:26:18,220 --> 03:26:22,880
Oh my god, if I do block wars again, I want all our skins to be black colors.

4300
03:26:26,800 --> 03:26:28,920
Sand, rock, dirt.

4301
03:26:34,320 --> 03:26:36,060
Sand, rock, dirt, coal.

4302
03:26:42,680 --> 03:26:44,860
They don't know my head.

4303
03:26:45,240 --> 03:26:46,720
They can't read my mind.

4304
03:26:46,820 --> 03:26:47,720
That's the thing.

4305
03:26:47,720 --> 03:26:49,520
That's the thing.

4306
03:26:49,600 --> 03:26:51,460
They can't read my mind.

4307
03:26:51,780 --> 03:26:54,820
I find the most stupid spots and it works.

4308
03:26:57,120 --> 03:26:59,160
My mind is an enigma.

4309
03:27:01,760 --> 03:27:05,040
Wait, I don't see any...

4310
03:27:05,040 --> 03:27:06,240
I don't see trees.

4311
03:27:06,460 --> 03:27:07,600
How do I do?

4312
03:27:07,720 --> 03:27:09,000
I don't see any amazing rooms.

4313
03:27:09,100 --> 03:27:09,680
I would check the corners.

4314
03:27:11,900 --> 03:27:13,220
That corner is lava.

4315
03:27:13,680 --> 03:27:14,260
The right.

4316
03:27:15,680 --> 03:27:17,000
This is my favorite.

4317
03:27:17,400 --> 03:27:18,820
This room is horrible.

4318
03:27:19,600 --> 03:27:20,200
Oh my god.

4319
03:27:21,300 --> 03:27:22,860
It's not bad for me.

4320
03:27:22,880 --> 03:27:25,360
The other corner, it's a village room.

4321
03:27:25,520 --> 03:27:26,180
A village room is scary.

4322
03:27:26,300 --> 03:27:28,080
I think we commit to this one.

4323
03:27:28,580 --> 03:27:29,500
This room is horrible.

4324
03:27:31,060 --> 03:27:32,340
Wait, why are we all here?

4325
03:27:32,600 --> 03:27:33,620
Why are we all here?

4326
03:27:34,420 --> 03:27:35,760
We all have faith in this room.

4327
03:27:37,780 --> 03:27:39,920
I am going to leave if I have to.

4328
03:27:40,040 --> 03:27:40,700
Just so you guys know.

4329
03:27:40,700 --> 03:27:43,360
Honestly, somebody is coming in.

4330
03:27:43,440 --> 03:27:44,440
We are fine.

4331
03:27:47,100 --> 03:27:49,100
I think this room is not bad.

4332
03:27:49,480 --> 03:27:50,820
You can look through the bottom.

4333
03:27:51,000 --> 03:27:52,180
You can play around the top.

4334
03:27:52,300 --> 03:27:54,180
It's hard to like...

4335
03:27:54,180 --> 03:27:55,300
The Among Us needs to go away.

4336
03:27:55,520 --> 03:27:56,380
You need to go away right now.

4337
03:27:57,420 --> 03:27:58,700
This Among Us is trolling.

4338
03:27:59,140 --> 03:28:00,280
What is this Among Us doing?

4339
03:28:01,800 --> 03:28:03,160
Maybe they think the Among Us is a sacrifice.

4340
03:28:04,500 --> 03:28:06,280
This Among Us is actually going to troll.

4341
03:28:06,400 --> 03:28:07,460
P has a good spot though.

4342
03:28:07,460 --> 03:28:08,640
P actually has a good spot up high.

4343
03:28:08,780 --> 03:28:11,800
I don't know if I like that spot.

4344
03:28:12,280 --> 03:28:13,540
Oh, two are here.

4345
03:28:13,860 --> 03:28:14,360
He went down.

4346
03:28:15,060 --> 03:28:15,500
I'm going.

4347
03:28:16,580 --> 03:28:17,880
Am I leaving?

4348
03:28:18,820 --> 03:28:19,780
You're not leaving.

4349
03:28:20,840 --> 03:28:21,880
You're not leaving.

4350
03:28:25,980 --> 03:28:26,540
Please.

4351
03:28:27,280 --> 03:28:28,340
Please leave.

4352
03:28:28,520 --> 03:28:29,120
I'll cry.

4353
03:28:29,400 --> 03:28:30,020
Oh my god.

4354
03:28:30,280 --> 03:28:31,240
This room is good.

4355
03:28:33,340 --> 03:28:34,320
Don't leave.

4356
03:28:34,320 --> 03:28:35,260
I'll cry.

4357
03:28:36,540 --> 03:28:38,300
Just stay right there.

4358
03:28:39,340 --> 03:28:40,820
It's harder in this room when they have speed 2.

4359
03:28:40,880 --> 03:28:41,460
I'm not going to lie, Hannah.

4360
03:28:43,360 --> 03:28:44,660
Yay, plus 2.

4361
03:28:46,920 --> 03:28:47,620
They have speed 2.

4362
03:28:48,780 --> 03:28:50,520
Honestly, maybe the corner with Doki is the play.

4363
03:28:50,580 --> 03:28:51,460
No, get out.

4364
03:28:51,720 --> 03:28:52,840
This is my corner.

4365
03:28:53,100 --> 03:28:53,600
Get out.

4366
03:28:53,820 --> 03:28:55,420
Doki, you hate teamwork.

4367
03:28:56,640 --> 03:28:57,840
This is my...

4368
03:28:57,840 --> 03:28:59,540
It's individualism here.

4369
03:29:00,280 --> 03:29:00,720
Michael!

4370
03:29:01,400 --> 03:29:01,760
It's okay.

4371
03:29:01,760 --> 03:29:02,700
We have 4.

4372
03:29:04,580 --> 03:29:05,500
Oh my god.

4373
03:29:05,840 --> 03:29:07,100
Keep it up.

4374
03:29:08,980 --> 03:29:09,580
What's it called?

4375
03:29:09,680 --> 03:29:10,300
Died that round.

4376
03:29:11,040 --> 03:29:11,780
Orange and yellow.

4377
03:29:12,920 --> 03:29:13,860
I don't know.

4378
03:29:15,340 --> 03:29:16,140
Shut up.

4379
03:29:17,640 --> 03:29:19,160
I'm going into the paint room.

4380
03:29:20,100 --> 03:29:21,720
I don't even know what this palace room is.

4381
03:29:22,140 --> 03:29:23,160
Wait, what was...

4382
03:29:23,600 --> 03:29:24,920
I've never been in this one.

4383
03:29:24,980 --> 03:29:26,940
The paint room is good, but it's hard to loop in there.

4384
03:29:27,700 --> 03:29:28,220
No, it's not.

4385
03:29:29,100 --> 03:29:29,500
No?

4386
03:29:30,020 --> 03:29:30,960
Doki, there's grass!

4387
03:29:31,640 --> 03:29:34,220
I know, but how much grass though?

4388
03:29:35,180 --> 03:29:36,680
I think the corner is always better, Hannah.

4389
03:29:36,760 --> 03:29:38,220
Because like...

4390
03:29:38,220 --> 03:29:38,740
I agree.

4391
03:29:38,960 --> 03:29:40,780
I'm going to the park corner.

4392
03:29:40,940 --> 03:29:42,380
We can get a high ground here.

4393
03:29:44,060 --> 03:29:45,000
There's only one way in.

4394
03:29:45,120 --> 03:29:47,360
You can go across the trapdoors if you need to as well.

4395
03:29:47,620 --> 03:29:49,680
What if they don't look up?

4396
03:29:51,120 --> 03:29:51,680
Is there a jump boost?

4397
03:29:51,840 --> 03:29:52,880
We're in a corner over here.

4398
03:29:53,720 --> 03:29:55,720
I think we will have to run eventually.

4399
03:29:55,720 --> 03:29:56,420
No Among Us.

4400
03:29:58,240 --> 03:30:00,160
Why would you do this to me?

4401
03:30:01,700 --> 03:30:03,560
Now I'm definitely going to cry.

4402
03:30:04,100 --> 03:30:05,240
Did the Among Us kill you?

4403
03:30:05,380 --> 03:30:07,320
No, he's like next to me.

4404
03:30:08,220 --> 03:30:08,860
Blue's coming in.

4405
03:30:09,200 --> 03:30:09,960
They're chasing somebody.

4406
03:30:12,080 --> 03:30:13,280
I can't see.

4407
03:30:14,320 --> 03:30:15,220
I can't see.

4408
03:30:15,260 --> 03:30:16,080
We need to pivot out of this room.

4409
03:30:16,840 --> 03:30:18,760
There's nobody over that way, so we need to pivot out that way.

4410
03:30:20,500 --> 03:30:21,220
He's distracted.

4411
03:30:23,200 --> 03:30:24,080
There's three here.

4412
03:30:24,080 --> 03:30:24,740
Oh my god.

4413
03:30:25,300 --> 03:30:26,200
Are they leaving?

4414
03:30:26,300 --> 03:30:28,500
No, they're not.

4415
03:30:30,880 --> 03:30:35,580
SK, go back to our OG spot.

4416
03:30:36,280 --> 03:30:37,380
He didn't see you.

4417
03:30:37,440 --> 03:30:38,420
He's looking.

4418
03:30:38,600 --> 03:30:40,700
Red is still alive.

4419
03:30:41,100 --> 03:30:42,080
SK, you're so good.

4420
03:30:42,660 --> 03:30:43,940
SK, you're so good.

4421
03:30:44,120 --> 03:30:46,640
SK, you're so good.

4422
03:30:46,780 --> 03:30:48,680
Find a safer spot.

4423
03:30:49,380 --> 03:30:50,500
That's pretty good.

4424
03:30:50,500 --> 03:30:51,800
That is a good spot.

4425
03:30:52,620 --> 03:30:53,300
Someone else is coming.

4426
03:30:53,440 --> 03:30:55,240
A handsome fella.

4427
03:30:56,800 --> 03:30:57,180
He knows.

4428
03:30:59,080 --> 03:31:00,380
He's looking for SK.

4429
03:31:01,060 --> 03:31:02,980
Oh my god, SK!

4430
03:31:04,280 --> 03:31:05,080
Generational.

4431
03:31:08,200 --> 03:31:09,620
He had F5!

4432
03:31:10,520 --> 03:31:12,000
He had F5!

4433
03:31:14,360 --> 03:31:16,840
If he doesn't have F5, I'd win.

4434
03:31:16,840 --> 03:31:17,820
Oh my god!

4435
03:31:19,640 --> 03:31:24,580
We are doing so good.

4436
03:31:24,660 --> 03:31:25,300
Keep it up.

4437
03:31:25,400 --> 03:31:26,620
SK, that was unbelievable.

4438
03:31:27,120 --> 03:31:29,260
Oh my god, it's the Krusty Krab room.

4439
03:31:29,560 --> 03:31:30,680
I don't think we start here.

4440
03:31:32,900 --> 03:31:34,840
F5 should be unbinded.

4441
03:31:38,060 --> 03:31:40,260
You can get in the head.

4442
03:31:43,420 --> 03:31:44,760
F5 should be unbinded.

4443
03:31:44,760 --> 03:31:45,960
There's a jump pad up into this.

4444
03:31:46,560 --> 03:31:47,660
I don't know if it's worth it right now.

4445
03:31:47,760 --> 03:31:48,300
It's sort of scary.

4446
03:31:49,000 --> 03:31:49,660
Wait, what do you mean?

4447
03:31:50,920 --> 03:31:52,300
There's literally a skibbity toilet room.

4448
03:31:52,400 --> 03:31:54,660
There's a jump pad and you can get in the back of it.

4449
03:31:54,720 --> 03:31:55,880
Oh, this room is scary.

4450
03:31:57,360 --> 03:31:57,780
Oh my god.

4451
03:31:57,820 --> 03:31:59,380
I have a better spot.

4452
03:31:59,500 --> 03:31:59,680
I'm chilling.

4453
03:32:01,860 --> 03:32:03,560
This spot is not bad.

4454
03:32:04,560 --> 03:32:05,200
Play here.

4455
03:32:05,300 --> 03:32:05,800
You have to play vision.

4456
03:32:05,960 --> 03:32:07,800
Can Michael McChill not troll, please?

4457
03:32:07,980 --> 03:32:08,980
Why are you here?

4458
03:32:09,840 --> 03:32:11,260
I'm getting out of F5 for this.

4459
03:32:11,800 --> 03:32:14,020
You can be in F5, but...

4460
03:32:14,020 --> 03:32:15,900
It's hard to see with the wall against us in the background.

4461
03:32:16,100 --> 03:32:17,520
Look this way.

4462
03:32:18,320 --> 03:32:18,540
Yeah.

4463
03:32:19,680 --> 03:32:21,000
Shadoon, please stop jumping.

4464
03:32:21,160 --> 03:32:22,820
It's Shadoon and Sleepy.

4465
03:32:23,680 --> 03:32:24,820
No, it's Michael McChill.

4466
03:32:25,620 --> 03:32:26,840
No, what?

4467
03:32:27,240 --> 03:32:29,120
I got trolled by...

4468
03:32:29,120 --> 03:32:31,660
I got trolled by a person who was next to me.

4469
03:32:32,140 --> 03:32:33,140
He got me killed.

4470
03:32:33,600 --> 03:32:34,560
He got me killed.

4471
03:32:35,060 --> 03:32:37,480
If I see another person, I'm fucking...

4472
03:32:37,480 --> 03:32:37,980
I'm leaving.

4473
03:32:41,460 --> 03:32:43,480
I got fruit berries.

4474
03:32:45,860 --> 03:32:46,980
Oh my god.

4475
03:32:47,040 --> 03:32:48,000
This is terrifying.

4476
03:32:48,920 --> 03:32:49,720
Oh, they're coming.

4477
03:32:49,820 --> 03:32:51,080
They're all coming for you.

4478
03:32:51,200 --> 03:32:52,160
I got one on me.

4479
03:32:52,860 --> 03:32:55,460
Oh, we have so many.

4480
03:32:56,960 --> 03:32:58,760
Oh, my first death.

4481
03:32:59,100 --> 03:33:00,880
I wanted to go seven for whatever.

4482
03:33:01,280 --> 03:33:02,460
He's right behind you, Addy.

4483
03:33:02,460 --> 03:33:03,520
He's right behind you.

4484
03:33:04,580 --> 03:33:05,220
There's two.

4485
03:33:05,820 --> 03:33:06,420
There's two.

4486
03:33:07,220 --> 03:33:09,400
At least lead them to somebody.

4487
03:33:09,400 --> 03:33:10,600
Oh, no.

4488
03:33:11,480 --> 03:33:12,600
Why didn't they turn back?

4489
03:33:13,080 --> 03:33:13,100
No.

4490
03:33:13,240 --> 03:33:13,520
It's okay.

4491
03:33:13,580 --> 03:33:14,460
We still have two.

4492
03:33:15,480 --> 03:33:16,880
We got this squad.

4493
03:33:18,460 --> 03:33:19,500
Wait, Esky, this spot is crazy.

4494
03:33:19,660 --> 03:33:20,020
What?

4495
03:33:20,800 --> 03:33:22,060
You can literally...

4496
03:33:22,060 --> 03:33:25,640
You can jump over the wall if you need to.

4497
03:33:25,720 --> 03:33:26,280
This is crazy.

4498
03:33:28,120 --> 03:33:29,720
Wait, we will be coming back to this room later.

4499
03:33:30,480 --> 03:33:31,020
Yeah, we should go back.

4500
03:33:31,040 --> 03:33:32,720
Last round after this.

4501
03:33:33,860 --> 03:33:34,580
Yay, Esky.

4502
03:33:35,580 --> 03:33:35,940
Yay.

4503
03:33:35,940 --> 03:33:36,100
Yay.

4504
03:33:38,260 --> 03:33:39,080
All right, guys.

4505
03:33:39,760 --> 03:33:40,200
Last round.

4506
03:33:40,720 --> 03:33:41,580
What did they say?

4507
03:33:42,660 --> 03:33:45,360
They want to play Simon Says.

4508
03:33:45,720 --> 03:33:47,180
I'm good.

4509
03:33:47,360 --> 03:33:47,660
I'm good.

4510
03:33:49,740 --> 03:33:51,660
That's what you do if you're in bottom half.

4511
03:33:52,280 --> 03:33:52,660
I don't know.

4512
03:33:53,600 --> 03:33:55,540
That could never be us.

4513
03:33:55,820 --> 03:33:57,660
That's crazy.

4514
03:33:58,480 --> 03:34:00,360
The room with the stands is really good, by the way.

4515
03:34:00,460 --> 03:34:01,080
If you can get up.

4516
03:34:01,740 --> 03:34:05,600
There's a really weird library room.

4517
03:34:05,980 --> 03:34:07,280
Oh, the library room is good, too.

4518
03:34:07,360 --> 03:34:08,220
If you get a high ground in it.

4519
03:34:08,380 --> 03:34:09,340
Oh, I found my OP spot.

4520
03:34:09,440 --> 03:34:11,320
Do I dare play here again?

4521
03:34:12,140 --> 03:34:13,360
Wait, I found my OP spot.

4522
03:34:14,040 --> 03:34:14,760
Or maybe.

4523
03:34:16,160 --> 03:34:17,960
Maybe they won't look down.

4524
03:34:18,580 --> 03:34:21,840
Guys, my last three rounds might not be the best round.

4525
03:34:23,160 --> 03:34:24,640
Look, and they're not even playing Simon Says.

4526
03:34:24,720 --> 03:34:25,220
They lied.

4527
03:34:27,020 --> 03:34:28,280
They killed a bunch.

4528
03:34:32,340 --> 03:34:34,180
He almost didn't look down.

4529
03:34:36,180 --> 03:34:39,360
Wait, they're actually playing Simon Says.

4530
03:34:41,500 --> 03:34:42,500
Well, CPK is hunting.

4531
03:34:42,680 --> 03:34:43,180
CPK is hunting.

4532
03:34:47,340 --> 03:34:48,440
There's only one person hunting.

4533
03:34:48,580 --> 03:34:50,640
We're doing this hunting, and CPK is playing.

4534
03:34:51,360 --> 03:34:52,620
Honestly, if I were you guys.

4535
03:34:52,840 --> 03:34:55,300
If they're coming to your room, I would just leave and go to a different room.

4536
03:34:55,420 --> 03:34:56,440
Because there's only two hunting right now.

4537
03:34:56,500 --> 03:34:57,960
It's worth rotating at this point.

4538
03:34:59,680 --> 03:35:01,480
I almost got away with it.

4539
03:35:05,020 --> 03:35:07,380
Wait, there's another Sonic?

4540
03:35:08,840 --> 03:35:10,260
This spot is ridiculous, by the way.

4541
03:35:12,640 --> 03:35:13,840
Hannah, come to me.

4542
03:35:13,980 --> 03:35:14,420
You see me jumping?

4543
03:35:14,540 --> 03:35:14,740
Come here.

4544
03:35:15,340 --> 03:35:16,460
No, I'm in a good spot.

4545
03:35:18,540 --> 03:35:19,440
SK, come here.

4546
03:35:19,700 --> 03:35:20,880
Do this jump pad right here.

4547
03:35:21,900 --> 03:35:22,940
There's a jump pad?

4548
03:35:23,140 --> 03:35:23,480
Whoa.

4549
03:35:24,640 --> 03:35:25,920
What if she dies?

4550
03:35:25,920 --> 03:35:26,900
And they can't see you from that door.

4551
03:35:26,980 --> 03:35:28,640
If you're coming from that door, you just move over this way.

4552
03:35:30,640 --> 03:35:32,900
Wait, they killed them all!

4553
03:35:34,000 --> 03:35:35,100
Oh, they killed everybody.

4554
03:35:41,280 --> 03:35:43,080
They don't care about charity.

4555
03:35:43,800 --> 03:35:45,260
They want it to win.

4556
03:35:45,440 --> 03:35:46,100
They don't care.

4557
03:35:48,420 --> 03:35:53,400
He tried to kill me last second.

4558
03:35:53,400 --> 03:35:56,040
Wow, we survived almost every single round, everyone.

4559
03:35:56,260 --> 03:35:56,720
Yeah, we did.

4560
03:35:56,820 --> 03:35:59,300
I lived every round, guys.

4561
03:35:59,320 --> 03:36:00,240
That might be the highest score.

4562
03:36:01,040 --> 03:36:01,480
Yeah.

4563
03:36:02,380 --> 03:36:03,480
Oh my god.

4564
03:36:04,440 --> 03:36:06,700
That might be the best score of all time.

4565
03:36:07,160 --> 03:36:08,120
The goat, the goat.

4566
03:36:09,160 --> 03:36:11,340
We might have pulled out top two, actually.

4567
03:36:11,420 --> 03:36:12,300
That's a dirt strat.

4568
03:36:12,720 --> 03:36:13,580
Lock in for a second.

4569
03:36:13,920 --> 03:36:16,360
What is the finale game and how do you play it?

4570
03:36:17,020 --> 03:36:17,900
It's Valorant.

4571
03:36:19,800 --> 03:36:21,540
It's Valorant, but it's meltdown, too.

4572
03:36:21,540 --> 03:36:22,940
It's one shot, one kill, Hannah.

4573
03:36:23,340 --> 03:36:23,900
Or a breakdown.

4574
03:36:24,920 --> 03:36:26,700
So when you're dead, are you dead dead?

4575
03:36:27,240 --> 03:36:28,560
No, you can get respawned by teammates.

4576
03:36:29,600 --> 03:36:30,440
What is Valorant?

4577
03:36:31,960 --> 03:36:35,140
You have to plant a bomb and then they have to defuse it.

4578
03:36:35,300 --> 03:36:36,640
It's literally like Valorant or CSGO.

4579
03:36:36,900 --> 03:36:43,480
There's two bomb sites and whoever's on attack has to put the bombs down and defend it for like 40 seconds or kill the whole other team.

4580
03:36:43,820 --> 03:36:47,700
And if you're on defense, you just need to defend the points and kill the entire team.

4581
03:36:47,800 --> 03:36:48,200
Gumi!

4582
03:36:48,200 --> 03:36:49,780
Okay, Gumi!

4583
03:36:50,000 --> 03:36:50,940
Gumi 10th Indian!

4584
03:36:51,440 --> 03:36:52,460
Gumi top 10!

4585
03:36:55,160 --> 03:36:56,140
Let's go, Hannah!

4586
03:36:56,340 --> 03:36:56,920
I think we made it.

4587
03:36:57,120 --> 03:36:59,840
I think we might have made it, actually.

4588
03:37:00,800 --> 03:37:02,200
I think we're...

4589
03:37:02,940 --> 03:37:03,780
I'll take six.

4590
03:37:04,160 --> 03:37:04,620
Yeah!

4591
03:37:06,180 --> 03:37:08,360
Guys, I fell off my podium.

4592
03:37:08,580 --> 03:37:08,780
Guys!

4593
03:37:11,900 --> 03:37:13,200
What should I do?

4594
03:37:13,720 --> 03:37:16,240
Should I floss or should I...

4595
03:37:16,240 --> 03:37:16,880
You need to floss?

4596
03:37:19,680 --> 03:37:21,100
Or T-pose.

4597
03:37:22,260 --> 03:37:23,720
I'm doing a T-pose.

4598
03:37:25,100 --> 03:37:25,640
Alright, guys.

4599
03:37:25,780 --> 03:37:28,260
I'm 99% sure we made it, so lock in.

4600
03:37:28,340 --> 03:37:28,860
Do your best.

4601
03:37:29,280 --> 03:37:30,060
Oh my god!

4602
03:37:30,140 --> 03:37:30,260
Gumi!

4603
03:37:31,820 --> 03:37:32,300
Yay!

4604
03:37:34,060 --> 03:37:34,660
Oh my god!

4605
03:37:35,060 --> 03:37:36,600
I'm so happy too!

4606
03:37:37,340 --> 03:37:38,520
Cause you know why.

4607
03:37:39,680 --> 03:37:40,360
Oh my god.

4608
03:37:41,400 --> 03:37:42,500
That's what you cut out.

4609
03:37:43,940 --> 03:37:45,020
First Flock Wars!

4610
03:37:45,440 --> 03:37:46,740
That is amazing.

4611
03:37:47,320 --> 03:37:49,900
Your first Flock Wars being 13th and this kind of comp is ridiculous.

4612
03:37:50,020 --> 03:37:50,920
That is a crazy placement.

4613
03:37:51,200 --> 03:37:52,380
Yeah, that's pretty good.

4614
03:37:52,460 --> 03:37:53,140
Holy shit.

4615
03:37:53,340 --> 03:37:54,540
Hopefully I'm A tier now.

4616
03:37:55,700 --> 03:37:56,000
Truly.

4617
03:37:58,000 --> 03:37:58,920
Sorry, that's cringe.

4618
03:37:59,160 --> 03:37:59,420
Sorry.

4619
03:38:00,080 --> 03:38:01,820
Alright, lock in, lock in.

4620
03:38:02,240 --> 03:38:02,760
We beat out pink.

4621
03:38:02,800 --> 03:38:03,420
We already beat out pink.

4622
03:38:03,500 --> 03:38:05,080
It's literally us, orange.

4623
03:38:05,320 --> 03:38:07,020
I think purple is guaranteed no matter what, right?

4624
03:38:07,900 --> 03:38:10,100
Wait, does purple play...

4625
03:38:10,100 --> 03:38:12,120
I don't think we're perfect.

4626
03:38:13,940 --> 03:38:15,020
Let's go!

4627
03:38:15,760 --> 03:38:16,400
Let's go!

4628
03:38:16,400 --> 03:38:16,780
Let's go!

4629
03:38:19,790 --> 03:38:23,410
We have three FPS players on our team for finals?

4630
03:38:24,230 --> 03:38:25,750
Okay, no, no.

4631
03:38:25,790 --> 03:38:26,570
I was not doing well.

4632
03:38:27,590 --> 03:38:28,670
Wait, you're first.

4633
03:38:31,230 --> 03:38:34,330
Orange actually has fallow players, though.

4634
03:38:34,670 --> 03:38:35,290
You're a fraud.

4635
03:38:35,950 --> 03:38:37,270
Shane, you're a fraud.

4636
03:38:37,570 --> 03:38:38,450
You're a fraud.

4637
03:38:39,250 --> 03:38:39,890
They're actually...

4638
03:38:39,890 --> 03:38:40,810
Oh my other freaky eye.

4639
03:38:44,070 --> 03:38:44,710
Oh no.

4640
03:38:45,210 --> 03:38:53,290
Okay, so this A and B site, usually, I don't know if we're an offensive defense, but usually if we're on offense, we're all going to go to one side with maybe one person lurking mid.

4641
03:38:54,070 --> 03:38:56,010
You plant bomb and you have to defend it.

4642
03:38:56,090 --> 03:38:57,030
Yeah, just plant fast.

4643
03:38:57,170 --> 03:38:57,870
It doesn't matter.

4644
03:38:58,670 --> 03:39:02,390
I think a lot of what happens in this game that people don't do very well is they give up ground.

4645
03:39:02,550 --> 03:39:07,670
So if we're on plant, if we get bombed down, we should keep one or two on site instead of just everybody running back.

4646
03:39:08,010 --> 03:39:09,070
Okay, I should play.

4647
03:39:09,090 --> 03:39:11,830
I have never played Valorant or CSGO, so yeah.

4648
03:39:12,110 --> 03:39:15,090
So essentially, Hannah, I think that if we get a point you should sit on point.

4649
03:39:15,270 --> 03:39:16,350
Just rat on point and kill them.

4650
03:39:16,410 --> 03:39:16,770
You just kill them.

4651
03:39:17,550 --> 03:39:17,670
Wait.

4652
03:39:20,430 --> 03:39:21,210
Seven minute break.

4653
03:39:21,330 --> 03:39:22,630
I can change my block colors.

4654
03:39:22,630 --> 03:39:23,390
Wait, can I go pee?

4655
03:39:23,770 --> 03:39:24,330
Do we have time?

4656
03:39:26,210 --> 03:39:27,830
Well, I'm going to get a cough drop.

4657
03:39:27,910 --> 03:39:28,890
I'll be right back, guys.

4658
03:39:28,970 --> 03:39:30,090
I'm literally going to be right back.

4659
03:39:30,350 --> 03:39:31,150
Okay, I'll be right back as well.

4660
03:39:31,250 --> 03:39:31,810
That is ridiculous.

4661
03:39:32,290 --> 03:39:32,910
That is insane.

4662
03:39:33,010 --> 03:39:34,110
They put us in this at a seven minute break.

4663
03:39:34,110 --> 03:39:34,570
That's crazy.

4664
03:39:35,870 --> 03:39:36,990
I'm relogging.

4665
03:39:38,950 --> 03:39:40,070
Seven minutes?

4666
03:39:42,230 --> 03:39:42,790
What?

4667
03:39:43,350 --> 03:39:45,930
In the most silent and quiet voice.

4668
03:39:46,210 --> 03:39:47,190
Seven minutes?

4669
03:39:53,430 --> 03:39:53,990
Wait, Doki.

4670
03:39:54,310 --> 03:39:55,150
Doki, are you here?

4671
03:39:58,090 --> 03:39:58,630
Escape.

4672
03:39:58,930 --> 03:40:01,190
I'm going to send it to AquaVC.

4673
03:40:02,890 --> 03:40:05,050
I sent a clip of what happened.

4674
03:40:06,350 --> 03:40:07,510
I gotta see this.

4675
03:40:09,830 --> 03:40:10,230
Back.

4676
03:40:11,050 --> 03:40:12,270
Is it actually seven minutes?

4677
03:40:13,150 --> 03:40:16,590
I sent a clip into the VC chat.

4678
03:40:17,090 --> 03:40:17,310
Okay.

4679
03:40:18,170 --> 03:40:19,570
Wait, I need to change my skin.

4680
03:40:23,010 --> 03:40:24,710
This clip might be a bit long.

4681
03:40:24,890 --> 03:40:28,950
You might want to skip around, but skip to where it's like 25 seconds.

4682
03:40:28,950 --> 03:40:29,050
Okay.

4683
03:40:30,450 --> 03:40:31,530
Oh my god, you fell.

4684
03:40:31,530 --> 03:40:33,130
Oh my gosh.

4685
03:40:33,870 --> 03:40:35,210
I need to turn my aimbot on.

4686
03:40:35,450 --> 03:40:37,430
I need to turn my aimbot on.

4687
03:40:37,530 --> 03:40:38,210
Give me a sec.

4688
03:40:39,470 --> 03:40:42,710
It might not work, but like maybe I'm coping.

4689
03:40:45,470 --> 03:40:46,590
No way.

4690
03:40:49,750 --> 03:40:51,390
Dude, I shut the fuck up.

4691
03:40:52,250 --> 03:40:53,530
That's not fair.

4692
03:40:53,630 --> 03:40:56,010
You have somebody with 0F5 on?

4693
03:40:56,110 --> 03:40:56,810
That's fucked.

4694
03:40:58,950 --> 03:41:00,590
Do we have time to change skins?

4695
03:41:01,330 --> 03:41:02,470
I changed skins already.

4696
03:41:02,630 --> 03:41:03,670
We have seven minutes!

4697
03:41:06,090 --> 03:41:07,020
Okay, um...

4698
03:41:07,330 --> 03:41:08,390
I'm gonna be a rock.

4699
03:41:10,970 --> 03:41:11,230
Oh!

4700
03:41:12,010 --> 03:41:13,390
Be a stone block!

4701
03:41:13,550 --> 03:41:13,870
Yeah!

4702
03:41:16,560 --> 03:41:20,490
Wait, will I be a smooth stone brick block or whatever?

4703
03:41:21,030 --> 03:41:21,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4704
03:41:23,530 --> 03:41:29,310
Smooth stone Stone brick skin Minecraft.

4705
03:41:30,650 --> 03:41:31,830
Doki, I found one for you.

4706
03:41:31,990 --> 03:41:33,490
Okay, I need to change it.

4707
03:41:37,250 --> 03:41:38,050
Copy link.

4708
03:41:38,250 --> 03:41:38,930
Send to Doki.

4709
03:41:39,230 --> 03:41:40,750
Hurry, hurry, because I don't have time.

4710
03:41:41,630 --> 03:41:42,930
Wait, can I like...

4711
03:41:42,930 --> 03:41:44,510
We have seven minutes, you bitch.

4712
03:41:45,190 --> 03:41:46,230
I don't know if seven...

4713
03:41:47,590 --> 03:41:49,070
Wait, won't it be easier to hit?

4714
03:41:49,150 --> 03:41:50,830
Because like, um...

4715
03:41:50,830 --> 03:41:51,370
there's light.

4716
03:41:51,650 --> 03:41:52,770
Like, when I stand up...

4717
03:41:54,030 --> 03:41:55,110
Look at the walls.

4718
03:41:55,370 --> 03:41:56,590
Oh, wait, really?

4719
03:41:56,710 --> 03:41:57,590
Okay, I got it.

4720
03:41:57,730 --> 03:41:58,050
Okay.

4721
03:41:58,330 --> 03:41:58,910
You see it?

4722
03:41:58,990 --> 03:41:59,910
Yeah, yeah, I see it.

4723
03:41:59,910 --> 03:42:00,250
Okay.

4724
03:42:01,250 --> 03:42:02,050
It's time.

4725
03:42:02,930 --> 03:42:04,770
We should all just be stones, guys.

4726
03:42:04,870 --> 03:42:05,590
I'm just saying.

4727
03:42:07,270 --> 03:42:09,270
Have you seen the I am stone challenge?

4728
03:42:09,590 --> 03:42:10,490
Oh my god!

4729
03:42:10,790 --> 03:42:12,070
He's a diamond block.

4730
03:42:12,490 --> 03:42:13,890
No, no, no, don't do it!

4731
03:42:13,970 --> 03:42:14,470
You shine!

4732
03:42:14,710 --> 03:42:17,270
If you have shaders on, you start shining.

4733
03:42:17,610 --> 03:42:19,770
No, you shouldn't!

4734
03:42:19,770 --> 03:42:21,650
She's a diamond block!

4735
03:42:21,730 --> 03:42:23,970
You actually sparkle!

4736
03:42:24,330 --> 03:42:25,970
She's not an actual diamond block!

4737
03:42:27,570 --> 03:42:28,690
I don't know!

4738
03:42:28,810 --> 03:42:29,590
I'm not in the game!

4739
03:42:31,670 --> 03:42:34,010
I don't want her to... I don't want her to sparkle!

4740
03:42:34,390 --> 03:42:36,270
Dude, I want to be a redstone block.

4741
03:42:37,310 --> 03:42:37,790
Redstone...

4742
03:42:37,790 --> 03:42:39,710
Block skin Minecraft.

4743
03:42:41,610 --> 03:42:42,450
I fucked up.

4744
03:42:42,530 --> 03:42:47,090
I put my... I used my shader ones instead of the actual one.

4745
03:42:47,830 --> 03:42:49,370
Download Minecraft skin.

4746
03:42:50,090 --> 03:42:50,770
Save.

4747
03:42:52,630 --> 03:42:54,550
We just think it's funny.

4748
03:42:55,090 --> 03:42:57,830
Oh, I should have been Maria, so Shadow won't shoot me.

4749
03:42:58,890 --> 03:43:01,090
Wait, I can still be Maria.

4750
03:43:01,330 --> 03:43:01,970
Wait, I'll be Maria.

4751
03:43:02,750 --> 03:43:06,790
I've never downloaded this many freaking Minecraft skins before.

4752
03:43:07,430 --> 03:43:11,450
Guys, do I do Maria or or a rock?

4753
03:43:11,890 --> 03:43:12,450
A rock?

4754
03:43:12,850 --> 03:43:13,510
Okay.

4755
03:43:13,510 --> 03:43:13,670
Okay.

4756
03:43:18,370 --> 03:43:19,410
Yes, he knows!

4757
03:43:19,550 --> 03:43:20,390
He was like, Maria?

4758
03:43:25,890 --> 03:43:27,310
I like that.

4759
03:43:29,650 --> 03:43:32,190
Guys, do you guys like this?

4760
03:43:34,250 --> 03:43:34,810
What's up?

4761
03:43:46,510 --> 03:43:53,050
Okay, but this skin will be easier to hit though because she's like blue.

4762
03:43:53,790 --> 03:43:54,650
Watch this.

4763
03:43:55,250 --> 03:43:56,030
Are you ready?

4764
03:43:56,250 --> 03:43:56,890
I'm watching.

4765
03:43:58,630 --> 03:44:00,390
Holy fuck, which way is she facing?

4766
03:44:00,890 --> 03:44:02,730
Wait, they don't know which way we're facing.

4767
03:44:03,350 --> 03:44:05,150
Oh, that's true.

4768
03:44:05,630 --> 03:44:07,250
They don't know.

4769
03:44:11,910 --> 03:44:13,590
We lose in the end.

4770
03:44:13,590 --> 03:44:14,990
We do all night.

4771
03:44:15,130 --> 03:44:17,070
And then we're like fucking dweebs.

4772
03:44:17,250 --> 03:44:18,110
We're like idiots.

4773
03:44:18,430 --> 03:44:21,010
They're like, wow, you guys have derp lock on.

4774
03:44:21,090 --> 03:44:22,210
You fucking pirates.

4775
03:44:22,410 --> 03:44:24,330
We just did it because we thought it was funny.

4776
03:44:25,710 --> 03:44:28,070
They don't even know how much fun we're having.

4777
03:44:28,810 --> 03:44:30,450
They think we're sweating.

4778
03:44:31,090 --> 03:44:32,790
We're just having fun.

4779
03:44:33,070 --> 03:44:36,010
We're sitting in ice rooms hiding things.

4780
03:44:37,970 --> 03:44:39,490
Our teammates deafened.

4781
03:44:39,990 --> 03:44:42,190
No, they're the ones that are trying.

4782
03:44:42,510 --> 03:44:48,030
We're just here to have a good time.

4783
03:44:51,470 --> 03:44:52,370
It's okay.

4784
03:44:52,950 --> 03:44:54,410
I'm joining their voice channel.

4785
03:44:55,070 --> 03:44:59,830
We were here to make sure the team average goes down.

4786
03:45:00,110 --> 03:45:00,630
That's fine.

4787
03:45:00,870 --> 03:45:01,850
It was too high.

4788
03:45:02,510 --> 03:45:03,870
That's why I was here.

4789
03:45:09,710 --> 03:45:11,330
It is called block wars.

4790
03:45:11,430 --> 03:45:13,690
We're putting the block in block wars.

4791
03:45:18,790 --> 03:45:20,650
They should have swapped too.

4792
03:45:21,170 --> 03:45:22,990
We could be a block family.

4793
03:45:33,910 --> 03:45:36,130
The derp clip goes crazy, Gumi.

4794
03:45:40,590 --> 03:45:41,850
They're going to be trying so hard.

4795
03:45:41,970 --> 03:45:43,210
We can win this.

4796
03:45:47,190 --> 03:45:48,430
I've never played this before.

4797
03:45:48,530 --> 03:45:49,350
I don't know which side is better.

4798
03:45:51,150 --> 03:45:53,050
B side is always better.

4799
03:45:54,290 --> 03:45:57,810
I will say it is very easy to flank on this.

4800
03:45:57,890 --> 03:46:00,870
Somebody might come through middle or might come through A.

4801
03:46:01,170 --> 03:46:03,550
We just need one person looking at flank.

4802
03:46:05,050 --> 03:46:10,910
For defense, I like the play of one person go to one side and all four go to the other side.

4803
03:46:11,410 --> 03:46:12,770
I like that too.

4804
03:46:14,250 --> 03:46:18,670
I think as a team, for rush B, one person lurk mid.

4805
03:46:19,550 --> 03:46:20,850
Who do we go lurking mid?

4806
03:46:21,810 --> 03:46:24,210
I think we need Hannah on site with us.

4807
03:46:25,050 --> 03:46:26,670
I think it might have to be you.

4808
03:46:26,850 --> 03:46:27,850
Is this counter strike?

4809
03:46:28,750 --> 03:46:29,990
Look at us.

4810
03:46:29,990 --> 03:46:32,130
Counter strike?

4811
03:46:33,650 --> 03:46:36,570
Everybody has an AWP and you can rez your teammates.

4812
03:46:38,170 --> 03:46:40,150
When you plan it, just stay there.

4813
03:46:40,250 --> 03:46:42,330
They have to defuse anyway.

4814
03:46:44,110 --> 03:46:47,450
There are a lot of points on site that you can hide on in corners.

4815
03:46:47,590 --> 03:46:49,870
You can just rat and hold your bow charge until they are on site.

4816
03:46:52,310 --> 03:46:53,110
I'm playing...

4817
03:46:54,070 --> 03:46:54,870
Lock in.

4818
03:46:55,270 --> 03:46:57,150
If I'm playing anti-flank, I'll try and...

4819
03:46:57,830 --> 03:46:58,930
There's a way to rez your teammates.

4820
03:46:59,110 --> 03:47:01,390
You have to hold right click on them.

4821
03:47:01,410 --> 03:47:03,010
Sometimes it's not worth it.

4822
03:47:03,590 --> 03:47:04,910
It's only worth it if you can do it safely.

4823
03:47:06,430 --> 03:47:07,750
Are people one shot?

4824
03:47:08,390 --> 03:47:08,690
Yes.

4825
03:47:08,910 --> 03:47:10,270
Every single shot is one shot.

4826
03:47:11,830 --> 03:47:13,050
A lot of them just pre-fire.

4827
03:47:13,470 --> 03:47:15,630
This team pre-fires a lot.

4828
03:47:16,630 --> 03:47:17,910
I watched last...

4829
03:47:17,910 --> 03:47:20,490
Last block wars, this is a very similar team.

4830
03:47:22,710 --> 03:47:24,590
These guys won last block wars.

4831
03:47:25,370 --> 03:47:26,510
This is site right here.

4832
03:47:26,630 --> 03:47:27,930
You see where that lantern is?

4833
03:47:28,470 --> 03:47:30,070
You can hide in the corner of site.

4834
03:47:30,150 --> 03:47:31,490
People don't check it as much.

4835
03:47:33,630 --> 03:47:35,130
If you want to try and rat there.

4836
03:47:35,830 --> 03:47:37,650
Doki, I can see a place where you can blend in.

4837
03:47:37,770 --> 03:47:37,910
Look.

4838
03:47:39,650 --> 03:47:41,170
I think I chose the wrong one.

4839
03:47:42,750 --> 03:47:44,690
Right clicking on the heart displayed above their bodies.

4840
03:47:44,850 --> 03:47:49,150
When people are down, if you hold down right click on the heart above their body, it will respawn them over time.

4841
03:47:50,010 --> 03:47:51,990
It takes a whole 5 seconds though.

4842
03:47:51,990 --> 03:47:54,910
Also, I don't think we should plant bomb until we have full site control.

4843
03:47:55,090 --> 03:47:59,870
No, plant bomb is very easy to plant bomb and then you don't have to defuse.

4844
03:48:00,010 --> 03:48:02,630
I think we all play shooters or games like this.

4845
03:48:02,890 --> 03:48:07,470
I think we should plant bomb fast so the timer goes down and it forces them to defuse.

4846
03:48:07,850 --> 03:48:09,970
Gumi and I won the last...

4847
03:48:09,970 --> 03:48:11,590
Gumi and I won block wars of this.

4848
03:48:12,650 --> 03:48:13,810
We have experience with this one.

4849
03:48:13,910 --> 03:48:14,830
This is crazy.

4850
03:48:15,090 --> 03:48:15,990
What if I sit...

4851
03:48:16,570 --> 03:48:17,470
You see this corner right here?

4852
03:48:17,850 --> 03:48:22,130
What if I sit there for the flank and just hold mid and A site?

4853
03:48:22,810 --> 03:48:23,870
How is this something you can pick here?

4854
03:48:25,470 --> 03:48:27,430
Is that a troll spot or no?

4855
03:48:27,430 --> 03:48:29,690
I feel like I can watch the flank sort of okay.

4856
03:48:29,870 --> 03:48:31,030
I think it's alright.

4857
03:48:31,650 --> 03:48:33,050
They show up here.

4858
03:48:33,750 --> 03:48:34,150
You can ping.

4859
03:48:34,870 --> 03:48:37,930
I feel like, isn't SK going to be the person flanking or whatever?

4860
03:48:38,170 --> 03:48:38,590
No, no, no.

4861
03:48:38,970 --> 03:48:39,690
I don't have to be.

4862
03:48:40,550 --> 03:48:42,090
I think SK should come with us.

4863
03:48:42,270 --> 03:48:44,350
I think with authority you have enough firepower to take a site.

4864
03:48:44,670 --> 03:48:45,870
One of you have to pick up the charge by the way.

4865
03:48:45,890 --> 03:48:46,850
I don't know who but one of you.

4866
03:48:47,430 --> 03:48:48,070
What's that?

4867
03:48:48,570 --> 03:48:49,930
It's a plant bomb.

4868
03:48:50,390 --> 03:48:51,310
I think you should plant bomb.

4869
03:48:51,450 --> 03:48:52,450
You have more experience with it.

4870
03:48:52,470 --> 03:48:52,850
I can plant.

4871
03:48:53,810 --> 03:48:56,310
Oh, we can select which side we want.

4872
03:48:56,930 --> 03:48:58,450
I think attack is better.

4873
03:48:58,850 --> 03:49:04,210
I think it's a lot harder to start on defense because you don't know what you're doing.

4874
03:49:04,450 --> 03:49:07,290
Like, Gumi and I won block wars with attack.

4875
03:49:07,350 --> 03:49:08,390
We won this event before.

4876
03:49:09,270 --> 03:49:10,750
Didn't you guys win the last one?

4877
03:49:11,110 --> 03:49:13,730
The one before the last.

4878
03:49:13,730 --> 03:49:16,730
It was like you and Feinberg and Gumi.

4879
03:49:16,770 --> 03:49:18,490
Yeah, that was the one I linked for the game.

4880
03:49:20,930 --> 03:49:22,130
So one of you pick that up.

4881
03:49:22,250 --> 03:49:23,530
I don't know if this spot is good or not.

4882
03:49:23,530 --> 03:49:24,410
Is this charged?

4883
03:49:27,110 --> 03:49:30,250
Ask Gumi and Doki if the spot is good.

4884
03:49:30,850 --> 03:49:32,270
I want to rat right here in the corner.

4885
03:49:32,570 --> 03:49:35,970
I think it's alright but most people they rarely flank.

4886
03:49:36,250 --> 03:49:37,410
Why would they come all the way back?

4887
03:49:40,270 --> 03:49:42,030
I think you can late like mid.

4888
03:49:42,030 --> 03:49:43,930
Instead of holding for flank, you just wait a bit.

4889
03:49:44,410 --> 03:49:45,590
Don't flank instantly.

4890
03:49:47,930 --> 03:49:51,210
I'm fine with you sitting there for like 15 seconds.

4891
03:49:51,750 --> 03:49:54,470
Hannah, take off your lunar pets if you have it on you.

4892
03:49:54,670 --> 03:49:57,370
They have to approach us.

4893
03:49:58,310 --> 03:49:59,870
They just have to push us.

4894
03:50:00,750 --> 03:50:01,830
They're in a disadvantage.

4895
03:50:02,590 --> 03:50:05,270
If we have bombsite, at least two of you should be on it playing from site.

4896
03:50:05,850 --> 03:50:07,250
We just have to hold angles.

4897
03:50:08,270 --> 03:50:10,970
This is really far away from both A and B.

4898
03:50:14,470 --> 03:50:18,470
If I don't see anybody within a bit I'll rotate over.

4899
03:50:19,330 --> 03:50:20,150
Rush B!

4900
03:50:21,690 --> 03:50:22,950
Alright Gumi, you plant.

4901
03:50:24,110 --> 03:50:25,530
I just have to test it.

4902
03:50:26,790 --> 03:50:28,650
When are we first going to see them?

4903
03:50:37,350 --> 03:50:38,470
They're not here.

4904
03:50:38,470 --> 03:50:38,910
They're not here.

4905
03:50:39,330 --> 03:50:40,210
Just plant if you can.

4906
03:50:42,430 --> 03:50:43,230
I'm just looking around.

4907
03:50:46,310 --> 03:50:47,690
Maybe find a good spot.

4908
03:50:48,230 --> 03:50:48,670
That's fine.

4909
03:50:49,190 --> 03:50:50,470
Then we can shoot them if they...

4910
03:50:52,950 --> 03:50:54,030
I'll tell you if I...

4911
03:50:54,030 --> 03:50:55,810
I'm watching some corners and stuff.

4912
03:50:56,490 --> 03:50:58,130
But I don't have my... Oh, someone shot.

4913
03:50:58,250 --> 03:50:58,770
I see five up.

4914
03:50:58,970 --> 03:50:59,790
They're in the thing.

4915
03:50:59,890 --> 03:51:00,590
I think they're all there.

4916
03:51:01,630 --> 03:51:03,150
I'll start flanking then.

4917
03:51:03,770 --> 03:51:04,510
I killed five up.

4918
03:51:04,510 --> 03:51:05,670
Should I push?

4919
03:51:06,370 --> 03:51:07,170
Just wait.

4920
03:51:07,690 --> 03:51:08,830
You don't need to push.

4921
03:51:09,090 --> 03:51:09,290
Just wait.

4922
03:51:10,390 --> 03:51:11,630
You don't need to push.

4923
03:51:11,710 --> 03:51:12,810
They have to defuse.

4924
03:51:13,230 --> 03:51:13,910
I'm going to try and run.

4925
03:51:14,110 --> 03:51:15,330
Just stay here.

4926
03:51:18,910 --> 03:51:20,230
They're rezzing on the back right.

4927
03:51:20,450 --> 03:51:22,510
It takes a long time to defuse.

4928
03:51:24,050 --> 03:51:25,010
I got my kill.

4929
03:51:25,090 --> 03:51:25,310
I got my kill.

4930
03:51:25,750 --> 03:51:26,810
That's all you have to do.

4931
03:51:26,870 --> 03:51:27,470
You just wait.

4932
03:51:31,770 --> 03:51:33,050
Still posted on the back right.

4933
03:51:33,870 --> 03:51:34,390
Bomb's planted.

4934
03:51:34,690 --> 03:51:36,410
They're going to defuse in time.

4935
03:51:38,030 --> 03:51:39,490
Five up is trying to jump shot you.

4936
03:51:40,130 --> 03:51:40,430
That's possible.

4937
03:51:41,870 --> 03:51:42,770
You just stay.

4938
03:51:43,290 --> 03:51:43,890
You just wait.

4939
03:51:44,670 --> 03:51:45,610
None of them flanked by the way.

4940
03:51:46,190 --> 03:51:48,730
You have to stay flanked just because they will change shots.

4941
03:51:49,610 --> 03:51:51,010
I'll stay longer this time.

4942
03:51:51,070 --> 03:51:52,390
I think maybe...

4943
03:51:52,390 --> 03:51:53,830
They might stack B.

4944
03:51:54,390 --> 03:51:55,110
Should we go B again?

4945
03:51:56,190 --> 03:51:56,650
I mean...

4946
03:51:58,050 --> 03:51:59,330
You want to pause?

4947
03:51:59,330 --> 03:51:59,450
Yes.

4948
03:52:00,190 --> 03:52:01,270
I think we go A.

4949
03:52:01,530 --> 03:52:03,150
You want to go A?

4950
03:52:04,730 --> 03:52:05,410
Let's go.

4951
03:52:06,350 --> 03:52:07,770
I'll take high ground in the end.

4952
03:52:08,110 --> 03:52:10,010
I've never been A though.

4953
03:52:10,010 --> 03:52:12,590
I don't know where the plant is.

4954
03:52:14,110 --> 03:52:15,410
They're coming A.

4955
03:52:18,770 --> 03:52:20,110
Did you plant it though?

4956
03:52:20,850 --> 03:52:21,290
I planted.

4957
03:52:21,910 --> 03:52:23,110
I don't think I can rez you.

4958
03:52:24,170 --> 03:52:24,790
Two flank.

4959
03:52:24,790 --> 03:52:26,750
Two flank.

4960
03:52:28,010 --> 03:52:28,830
I messed up.

4961
03:52:29,850 --> 03:52:30,370
Five up.

4962
03:52:30,570 --> 03:52:32,570
I'm bad.

4963
03:52:32,750 --> 03:52:33,730
I missed my shot.

4964
03:52:34,810 --> 03:52:35,010
I know.

4965
03:52:38,010 --> 03:52:38,990
It's just you SK.

4966
03:52:39,170 --> 03:52:39,690
It's here.

4967
03:52:40,730 --> 03:52:41,650
You don't have to peek.

4968
03:52:41,830 --> 03:52:43,790
You don't have to peek SK.

4969
03:52:44,510 --> 03:52:45,870
I'm in a corner.

4970
03:52:46,270 --> 03:52:47,050
One on spike.

4971
03:52:49,170 --> 03:52:50,370
That was my bad.

4972
03:52:50,490 --> 03:52:52,730
I messed up the anti-flank.

4973
03:52:52,730 --> 03:52:54,350
Five up ran forward and I missed my shot.

4974
03:52:54,430 --> 03:52:55,490
Fruit came right behind him.

4975
03:52:57,450 --> 03:52:59,530
I saw A site.

4976
03:52:59,650 --> 03:53:00,950
I think B is way better.

4977
03:53:01,130 --> 03:53:02,150
B is easier.

4978
03:53:02,310 --> 03:53:04,170
I get the high ground easily.

4979
03:53:04,590 --> 03:53:05,890
We're on defense now.

4980
03:53:06,250 --> 03:53:07,850
They get the high ground.

4981
03:53:08,070 --> 03:53:11,430
What do we want to do for our defense?

4982
03:53:11,890 --> 03:53:12,990
Someone should flank.

4983
03:53:13,230 --> 03:53:14,190
3B, 2A.

4984
03:53:15,570 --> 03:53:16,490
I think we should go B.

4985
03:53:17,370 --> 03:53:18,330
Why did they go A?

4986
03:53:19,490 --> 03:53:20,610
Let's go to 3B.

4987
03:53:21,490 --> 03:53:22,630
Why are we saying interview?

4988
03:53:22,830 --> 03:53:24,050
I don't know.

4989
03:53:24,910 --> 03:53:26,390
What do we do here?

4990
03:53:30,790 --> 03:53:32,310
We're just preventing them from planting.

4991
03:53:33,310 --> 03:53:34,210
3A at least.

4992
03:53:36,170 --> 03:53:37,410
I don't see anybody here.

4993
03:53:38,050 --> 03:53:38,650
They're B.

4994
03:53:39,030 --> 03:53:40,790
They're going to plant.

4995
03:53:42,250 --> 03:53:43,890
They're playing in the god spot.

4996
03:53:44,570 --> 03:53:45,350
The spot that we had.

4997
03:53:46,490 --> 03:53:47,390
3B is holding me mid.

4998
03:53:47,610 --> 03:53:48,870
Try and flank them, Ant.

4999
03:53:48,870 --> 03:53:49,330
I can't.

5000
03:53:49,610 --> 03:53:50,070
3B is holding me.

5001
03:53:50,090 --> 03:53:51,230
I'm going to go to you guys instead.

5002
03:53:52,230 --> 03:53:53,070
I have to push up.

5003
03:53:55,390 --> 03:53:56,230
I got one.

5004
03:53:56,710 --> 03:53:58,170
I'm behind you.

5005
03:53:58,270 --> 03:53:58,650
You can get me.

5006
03:54:00,290 --> 03:54:01,550
3B is out in the open.

5007
03:54:02,890 --> 03:54:03,710
3B is out in the open.

5008
03:54:04,410 --> 03:54:05,470
He's right here.

5009
03:54:05,710 --> 03:54:07,650
He's literally...

5010
03:54:07,650 --> 03:54:08,070
Nice.

5011
03:54:09,390 --> 03:54:09,810
I'm defusing.

5012
03:54:12,430 --> 03:54:13,630
They're all dead.

5013
03:54:14,530 --> 03:54:14,990
Really?

5014
03:54:15,670 --> 03:54:16,470
Just defuse.

5015
03:54:16,710 --> 03:54:17,450
Let's go.

5016
03:54:18,490 --> 03:54:19,590
I don't even know where I got shot from.

5017
03:54:19,670 --> 03:54:20,950
That was a crazy cross map shot.

5018
03:54:21,470 --> 03:54:22,950
I didn't do anything.

5019
03:54:24,050 --> 03:54:25,410
3B is holding flank.

5020
03:54:26,150 --> 03:54:26,770
It's hard.

5021
03:54:28,790 --> 03:54:30,690
You're forcing him to look at that spot.

5022
03:54:30,930 --> 03:54:31,290
That's the thing.

5023
03:54:32,570 --> 03:54:34,730
I don't have a full commit to a flank.

5024
03:54:34,850 --> 03:54:35,790
Unless I want to take a 1v1.

5025
03:54:36,030 --> 03:54:37,110
You're forcing him to look at it.

5026
03:54:37,230 --> 03:54:37,670
It's fine.

5027
03:54:38,170 --> 03:54:40,750
It's just esports.

5028
03:54:41,630 --> 03:54:42,230
Yeah.

5029
03:54:43,510 --> 03:54:47,990
Should I try and get in a good spot closer up?

5030
03:54:48,930 --> 03:54:49,310
Are they A?

5031
03:54:49,470 --> 03:54:50,550
I think they went A mid.

5032
03:54:51,130 --> 03:54:51,930
Guys, they went A.

5033
03:54:52,650 --> 03:54:53,750
I'm rotating.

5034
03:54:54,750 --> 03:54:56,190
Where are you mid?

5035
03:54:56,390 --> 03:54:58,310
They might be slow rotating.

5036
03:54:59,070 --> 03:55:00,070
Michael is mid right now.

5037
03:55:00,650 --> 03:55:01,350
I'm coming over.

5038
03:55:01,930 --> 03:55:02,650
Just stay.

5039
03:55:03,470 --> 03:55:04,730
They're slow rotating.

5040
03:55:06,090 --> 03:55:07,110
They're high ground.

5041
03:55:08,590 --> 03:55:09,750
That's fine.

5042
03:55:09,750 --> 03:55:10,710
They're slow rotating.

5043
03:55:11,710 --> 03:55:12,910
They're playing time.

5044
03:55:13,430 --> 03:55:14,210
It's fine.

5045
03:55:14,470 --> 03:55:17,250
We can play time as well.

5046
03:55:17,470 --> 03:55:18,150
Full commit B.

5047
03:55:19,450 --> 03:55:19,930
Planet A.

5048
03:55:20,490 --> 03:55:22,630
Should we go A?

5049
03:55:23,350 --> 03:55:24,370
They're planet A.

5050
03:55:25,130 --> 03:55:26,470
If you get up the ladder, you can res me.

5051
03:55:27,250 --> 03:55:28,790
They're going to try to res me right now.

5052
03:55:29,430 --> 03:55:30,410
I'm on the ladder.

5053
03:55:31,910 --> 03:55:32,690
He's trying to res.

5054
03:55:34,070 --> 03:55:34,590
Nice.

5055
03:55:36,350 --> 03:55:37,530
Road over here.

5056
03:55:37,530 --> 03:55:38,250
That's where fruit is.

5057
03:55:38,690 --> 03:55:39,410
Fruit's here.

5058
03:55:40,550 --> 03:55:42,110
I'm defusing it.

5059
03:55:42,150 --> 03:55:43,550
I got him.

5060
03:55:44,890 --> 03:55:46,130
They're all dead.

5061
03:55:46,710 --> 03:55:47,950
Let's go.

5062
03:55:48,550 --> 03:55:49,690
Easy round.

5063
03:55:50,910 --> 03:55:52,190
Who flanked behind?

5064
03:55:52,370 --> 03:55:52,730
Me.

5065
03:55:53,450 --> 03:55:55,570
That was a crazy shot.

5066
03:55:57,710 --> 03:55:59,250
Everyone rush B.

5067
03:56:00,250 --> 03:56:01,070
I'll take high ground.

5068
03:56:01,310 --> 03:56:01,970
I can take high ground.

5069
03:56:03,110 --> 03:56:05,110
Someone has to hold for me.

5070
03:56:05,110 --> 03:56:06,230
The spawn strategy.

5071
03:56:06,390 --> 03:56:09,250
They didn't even...

5072
03:56:09,250 --> 03:56:09,950
I'll play in a different spot.

5073
03:56:11,970 --> 03:56:14,810
I'm going to stay where I was at last time.

5074
03:56:15,250 --> 03:56:15,630
It was a good spot.

5075
03:56:15,630 --> 03:56:16,890
I'm going to go where I was at on B.

5076
03:56:21,210 --> 03:56:22,610
There's this height spot.

5077
03:56:22,610 --> 03:56:24,290
That was my spot.

5078
03:56:25,070 --> 03:56:26,050
I see Michael.

5079
03:56:27,270 --> 03:56:29,130
I planted for Godspot.

5080
03:56:29,530 --> 03:56:30,110
You did.

5081
03:56:31,890 --> 03:56:32,930
I'm waiting.

5082
03:56:33,810 --> 03:56:34,470
I'm down.

5083
03:56:34,470 --> 03:56:35,670
Can someone rez?

5084
03:56:35,810 --> 03:56:36,610
You can rez.

5085
03:56:36,710 --> 03:56:37,730
I'll look.

5086
03:56:37,810 --> 03:56:38,990
I don't see anyone flank yet.

5087
03:56:39,690 --> 03:56:40,090
Outside.

5088
03:56:41,490 --> 03:56:42,790
They're not defusing.

5089
03:56:42,950 --> 03:56:43,350
I'm looking.

5090
03:56:45,090 --> 03:56:46,370
I'm going to Godspot.

5091
03:56:47,230 --> 03:56:47,790
Are they there?

5092
03:56:48,230 --> 03:56:49,190
One's on the bomb.

5093
03:56:49,290 --> 03:56:49,830
He's not defusing.

5094
03:56:50,330 --> 03:56:51,910
He is.

5095
03:56:52,030 --> 03:56:52,490
In the corner.

5096
03:56:54,730 --> 03:56:55,250
No!

5097
03:56:55,410 --> 03:56:56,550
We did it!

5098
03:56:56,950 --> 03:56:58,890
We did it!

5099
03:56:59,230 --> 03:57:01,030
Oh my god!

5100
03:57:01,030 --> 03:57:01,530
Let's go!

5101
03:57:03,230 --> 03:57:03,870
Oh

5102
03:57:07,550 --> 03:57:09,530
my god!

5103
03:57:10,070 --> 03:57:10,990
We won for Minecraft!

5104
03:57:12,770 --> 03:57:13,930
Let's go!

5105
03:57:14,410 --> 03:57:14,930
Let's go!

5106
03:57:17,230 --> 03:57:18,290
That's what I'm saying.

5107
03:57:18,530 --> 03:57:19,490
We deserved the game.

5108
03:57:20,690 --> 03:57:23,710
That was the most generational comeback that we've ever had.

5109
03:57:23,950 --> 03:57:25,370
That was generational comeback!

5110
03:57:25,830 --> 03:57:28,150
That was such a generational comeback for us.

5111
03:57:28,490 --> 03:57:29,210
Let's go!

5112
03:57:31,150 --> 03:57:32,070
Oh my god!

5113
03:57:32,070 --> 03:57:32,110
Oh my god!

5114
03:57:33,910 --> 03:57:34,830
We did it!

5115
03:57:35,010 --> 03:57:37,350
We have 100% win rate together!

5116
03:57:37,910 --> 03:57:38,770
Let's go!

5117
03:57:39,950 --> 03:57:43,930
Technically, it's 100% win rate for this block war.

5118
03:57:44,090 --> 03:57:45,070
We're going for purple.

5119
03:57:49,690 --> 03:57:51,730
We love charity.

5120
03:57:52,430 --> 03:57:53,270
That was so good.

5121
03:57:53,570 --> 03:57:54,830
Happy skin.

5122
03:57:55,470 --> 03:57:57,130
Wait, do we get medals for this?

5123
03:57:57,130 --> 03:57:58,470
I did nothing.

5124
03:57:58,470 --> 03:58:00,110
We might!

5125
03:58:00,470 --> 03:58:01,330
We're going to get medals!

5126
03:58:02,030 --> 03:58:04,370
We're going to get medals!

5127
03:58:07,470 --> 03:58:09,690
Everyone come close and take a screenshot.

5128
03:58:10,050 --> 03:58:12,030
We look so ugly.

5129
03:58:13,790 --> 03:58:16,070
I think I look beautiful.

5130
03:58:19,550 --> 03:58:21,650
Get over here!

5131
03:58:24,030 --> 03:58:25,710
Scoot over.

5132
03:58:28,470 --> 03:58:31,610
I had the aim, but I...

5133
03:58:31,610 --> 03:58:33,250
Chad, you guys touted me.

5134
03:58:34,230 --> 03:58:35,690
If it isn't a fraud.

5135
03:58:37,970 --> 03:58:39,190
Well, well, well.

5136
03:58:39,530 --> 03:58:40,470
That's right, Chad.

5137
03:58:40,630 --> 03:58:41,110
Wait, wait, wait.

5138
03:58:41,290 --> 03:58:44,130
Look at our last game.

5139
03:58:44,210 --> 03:58:47,130
All of us were top 15 in blitz time, by the way.

5140
03:58:47,250 --> 03:58:48,450
Oh my god!

5141
03:58:48,850 --> 03:58:49,970
I wonder why.

5142
03:58:54,850 --> 03:58:55,950
We just died.

5143
03:58:55,950 --> 03:58:59,270
Shane, how did you know I was in the ice most of the time?

5144
03:58:59,990 --> 03:59:01,310
As a dirt block.

5145
03:59:05,130 --> 03:59:06,710
I saw you when we were voting.

5146
03:59:06,850 --> 03:59:07,710
I was like, wait a minute.

5147
03:59:07,910 --> 03:59:09,110
And then you guys all were voting.

5148
03:59:09,370 --> 03:59:12,690
And I was like, wait a minute.

5149
03:59:14,990 --> 03:59:16,710
Do you like our final skins?

5150
03:59:17,110 --> 03:59:18,670
Yeah, do you guys like our final skins?

5151
03:59:20,170 --> 03:59:23,770
Shane, how do you see the points for...

5152
03:59:23,770 --> 03:59:25,210
If you go to the middle.

5153
03:59:26,510 --> 03:59:27,890
I'm stuck on this podium.

5154
03:59:28,090 --> 03:59:28,770
No, you're not.

5155
03:59:28,890 --> 03:59:29,310
Go behind.

5156
03:59:29,450 --> 03:59:30,190
Go in the back.

5157
03:59:31,790 --> 03:59:33,430
Then you can leave.

5158
03:59:33,730 --> 03:59:34,570
You guys were W.

5159
03:59:35,510 --> 03:59:35,950
Yeah!

5160
03:59:36,490 --> 03:59:37,270
Did we get an interview?

5161
03:59:40,050 --> 03:59:41,590
Probably one of you at least.

5162
03:59:41,930 --> 03:59:42,490
One of us?

5163
03:59:42,630 --> 03:59:43,690
We're a team.

5164
03:59:44,210 --> 03:59:45,610
We're a team.

5165
03:59:45,770 --> 03:59:46,930
That was a team effort.

5166
03:59:48,490 --> 03:59:50,150
You guys did amazing on that.

5167
03:59:50,430 --> 03:59:51,570
Goomy, oh my god.

5168
03:59:51,570 --> 03:59:52,750
That last game, literally.

5169
03:59:52,970 --> 03:59:53,890
I didn't do anything.

5170
03:59:54,010 --> 03:59:54,490
I got carried.

5171
03:59:54,610 --> 03:59:56,250
I literally did nothing in that game.

5172
03:59:58,350 --> 04:00:01,350
That was the FPS player mindset right there.

5173
04:00:01,610 --> 04:00:03,830
Dude, three of us are FPS players.

5174
04:00:04,210 --> 04:00:06,950
I got so many kills in the last one.

5175
04:00:08,850 --> 04:00:11,710
I want to see how long he had left on the defuse.

5176
04:00:11,730 --> 04:00:14,850
Shane, I think every single round we had four people alive at minimum.

5177
04:00:15,090 --> 04:00:16,530
Yeah, you guys did really well.

5178
04:00:17,090 --> 04:00:18,750
Our team, it would just be three of us.

5179
04:00:18,750 --> 04:00:22,150
That's gotta be, like, what's Hunt's record on multiplayer.

5180
04:00:22,710 --> 04:00:23,910
Surely, it's gotta be.

5181
04:00:24,190 --> 04:00:25,650
You guys probably did really well.

5182
04:00:26,550 --> 04:00:28,070
Let's take a look over here real quick.

5183
04:00:28,750 --> 04:00:29,890
I'm changing my skin.

5184
04:00:30,530 --> 04:00:31,370
Wait, is there a...

5185
04:00:31,370 --> 04:00:33,270
Wait, I got 14.

5186
04:00:35,150 --> 04:00:38,970
Well, you're an OP team, so I don't know about Feinberg, but you got this guy.

5187
04:00:39,290 --> 04:00:39,690
It's okay.

5188
04:00:40,630 --> 04:00:43,110
They said the entire team can be interviewed.

5189
04:00:43,290 --> 04:00:44,250
Yeah, let's go!

5190
04:00:46,350 --> 04:00:46,950
Let's go!

5191
04:00:47,950 --> 04:00:48,430
Yay!

5192
04:00:51,490 --> 04:00:52,450
Winners only!

5193
04:00:53,490 --> 04:00:54,850
Oh, my bad.

5194
04:00:55,090 --> 04:00:56,170
Actually, I'm gonna...

5195
04:00:56,170 --> 04:00:56,550
You know what?

5196
04:00:56,650 --> 04:00:57,790
Sorry, I just found a cliff.

5197
04:00:57,910 --> 04:00:58,590
I'm gonna...

5198
04:01:00,150 --> 04:01:01,750
Oh my god, my stomach hurts.

5199
04:01:01,990 --> 04:01:03,970
Maybe you should've been a Minecraft block.

5200
04:01:04,770 --> 04:01:06,890
You know what?

5201
04:01:07,050 --> 04:01:08,570
I'm kind of a base.

5202
04:01:10,090 --> 04:01:11,330
Everyone go, everyone go.

5203
04:01:11,330 --> 04:01:13,110
Good job, guys.

5204
04:01:13,250 --> 04:01:14,630
Thank you.

5205
04:01:19,040 --> 04:01:19,560
Hello!

5206
04:01:21,940 --> 04:01:23,520
I gotta fix my webcam.

5207
04:01:23,640 --> 04:01:24,440
Oh, wait.

5208
04:01:24,780 --> 04:01:27,100
I need to turn on my virtual camera.

5209
04:01:27,640 --> 04:01:28,760
I have a face cam.

5210
04:01:31,500 --> 04:01:33,800
Guys, I am so happy right now.

5211
04:01:37,340 --> 04:01:38,380
Yo, cute!

5212
04:01:39,040 --> 04:01:40,380
Wait, I have to fix this.

5213
04:01:40,380 --> 04:01:41,060
Oh, my gosh.

5214
04:01:41,320 --> 04:01:42,780
Hey, this is me.

5215
04:01:43,860 --> 04:01:44,320
Hello!

5216
04:01:45,840 --> 04:01:47,100
Wait, I should swap, too.

5217
04:01:48,400 --> 04:01:49,140
I should swap here.

5218
04:01:49,840 --> 04:01:51,740
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna advertise my gamer stuff, too.

5219
04:01:52,300 --> 04:01:52,620
Oh, my god.

5220
04:01:54,680 --> 04:01:56,740
I literally advertised my merch.

5221
04:01:56,920 --> 04:01:57,380
Yay!

5222
04:01:57,780 --> 04:01:59,740
That's a crazy ad.

5223
04:01:59,960 --> 04:02:00,800
Did I have a lighting?

5224
04:02:00,940 --> 04:02:01,900
It's dark out.

5225
04:02:01,900 --> 04:02:02,900
Let's do merch.

5226
04:02:07,060 --> 04:02:08,700
Wait, I got another idea.

5227
04:02:08,860 --> 04:02:11,520
I gotta advertise multiple things.

5228
04:02:11,860 --> 04:02:13,580
Put everything on the screen.

5229
04:02:14,420 --> 04:02:14,920
Bro.

5230
04:02:19,120 --> 04:02:19,760
Oh,

5231
04:02:22,840 --> 04:02:23,080
my god.

5232
04:02:27,220 --> 04:02:29,580
Someone asked if they win those medals.

5233
04:02:29,580 --> 04:02:31,760
Yeah, yeah, I won the medal.

5234
04:02:32,100 --> 04:02:33,060
I'm gonna ask you.

5235
04:02:33,240 --> 04:02:33,980
There you go.

5236
04:02:34,120 --> 04:02:36,640
That was a good FPS round for me.

5237
04:02:39,800 --> 04:02:41,740
I was literally so lost during that game.

5238
04:02:41,760 --> 04:02:42,420
I'm not even gonna lie.

5239
04:02:43,260 --> 04:02:45,740
I literally killed through for the last kill.

5240
04:02:45,860 --> 04:02:46,700
Okay, you're right, guys.

5241
04:02:48,040 --> 04:02:49,160
I was like, why are you guys screaming?

5242
04:02:50,580 --> 04:02:51,500
You're right, guys.

5243
04:02:51,800 --> 04:02:52,500
You're locked in.

5244
04:02:52,700 --> 04:02:54,200
It was so stupid.

5245
04:02:54,280 --> 04:02:57,300
He was that close to getting it off.

5246
04:02:57,300 --> 04:02:59,380
Because he was on it for a while.

5247
04:02:59,460 --> 04:03:00,080
Okay, there we go.

5248
04:03:00,140 --> 04:03:01,940
Now I have all the things I want to advertise.

5249
04:03:07,380 --> 04:03:09,440
Does anyone want to buy ad space?

5250
04:03:09,720 --> 04:03:10,780
On my channel?

5251
04:03:11,440 --> 04:03:23,060
Yeah, you like the jelly one?

5252
04:03:24,140 --> 04:03:25,020
Yeah, hello.

5253
04:03:25,020 --> 04:03:25,560
Hello.

5254
04:03:27,720 --> 04:03:29,280
Wait, make yourself really large.

5255
04:03:33,000 --> 04:03:33,940
You're right, okay.

5256
04:03:34,720 --> 04:03:36,680
I need to add a text here, too.

5257
04:03:37,360 --> 04:03:39,440
Oh, he was only at 60% defused.

5258
04:03:40,440 --> 04:03:42,380
It takes a really long time to defuse.

5259
04:03:42,640 --> 04:03:44,660
That's why I said you have to plant fast.

5260
04:03:45,660 --> 04:03:45,940
Yeah.

5261
04:03:46,960 --> 04:03:48,020
That was a really good callout.

5262
04:03:49,580 --> 04:03:52,040
That's how Queenie and I won the last one.

5263
04:03:52,240 --> 04:03:53,280
We just planted fast.

5264
04:03:58,920 --> 04:04:00,380
So did IGLing.

5265
04:04:00,780 --> 04:04:00,820
Yeah.

5266
04:04:01,400 --> 04:04:02,300
Let's go.

5267
04:04:03,460 --> 04:04:04,480
We knew what's up.

5268
04:04:04,720 --> 04:04:07,040
Guys, that redeemed myself from the fucking...

5269
04:04:07,040 --> 04:04:07,380
What was it?

5270
04:04:07,440 --> 04:04:08,080
The gun game.

5271
04:04:08,200 --> 04:04:09,880
That shit was fucking ass for me.

5272
04:04:10,860 --> 04:04:12,840
Oh, the deathmatch.

5273
04:04:13,120 --> 04:04:14,840
The deathmatch was so bad for me.

5274
04:04:14,940 --> 04:04:17,140
And then the Valorant one.

5275
04:04:17,240 --> 04:04:18,720
I got so many kills there.

5276
04:04:20,020 --> 04:04:21,300
You were bragging.

5277
04:04:22,380 --> 04:04:23,400
Oh, oh, photon.

5278
04:04:24,680 --> 04:04:25,400
Oh, photon.

5279
04:04:25,760 --> 04:04:27,300
I did terrible in extraction.

5280
04:04:27,480 --> 04:04:29,120
That was my worst extraction ever.

5281
04:04:29,260 --> 04:04:30,500
That was sort of embarrassing, I won't lie.

5282
04:04:31,180 --> 04:04:32,080
It's because I was on your team.

5283
04:04:32,200 --> 04:04:32,580
I'm cursed.

5284
04:04:32,940 --> 04:04:33,780
No, no, no.

5285
04:04:33,960 --> 04:04:35,300
I was not playing well.

5286
04:04:35,360 --> 04:04:35,660
I promise.

5287
04:04:35,740 --> 04:04:36,180
It was me.

5288
04:04:36,340 --> 04:04:38,540
Can you believe we came out with top points?

5289
04:04:40,080 --> 04:04:43,040
Considering we were in like 6th going into 5th game, no.

5290
04:04:43,240 --> 04:04:44,680
I thought we were cucked, I'm not gonna lie.

5291
04:04:45,200 --> 04:04:46,900
That battle was so good, though.

5292
04:04:47,940 --> 04:04:50,140
Like 6th to 7th or 8th on the reddit.

5293
04:04:50,160 --> 04:04:51,000
I think we were like 4th.

5294
04:04:51,000 --> 04:04:52,560
I think I said like 4th to 6th.

5295
04:04:52,660 --> 04:04:54,280
Yeah, we did so well, guys.

5296
04:04:54,460 --> 04:04:56,560
I personally thought we were a top 2 team.

5297
04:04:56,700 --> 04:04:57,100
So did I.

5298
04:04:57,160 --> 04:04:58,400
I thought we were gonna win the whole time.

5299
04:04:59,380 --> 04:05:00,440
I was vibing.

5300
04:05:01,620 --> 04:05:02,100
I was like...

5301
04:05:02,100 --> 04:05:03,280
I was so happy, dude.

5302
04:05:03,400 --> 04:05:04,460
Our battle was beautiful.

5303
04:05:04,920 --> 04:05:07,400
Dude, that's why they wanted battle first, because they knew we were gonna do so good.

5304
04:05:07,420 --> 04:05:08,080
They were terrified.

5305
04:05:09,180 --> 04:05:10,120
Oh my god, I'm so happy.

5306
04:05:10,400 --> 04:05:11,220
I'm so happy!

5307
04:05:11,400 --> 04:05:13,580
We've won so many events together, I feel like.

5308
04:05:13,680 --> 04:05:14,240
I know!

5309
04:05:15,260 --> 04:05:18,540
Dude, we've won a lot of Twitch rivals together, huh?

5310
04:05:18,540 --> 04:05:20,020
And MCC Party.

5311
04:05:20,260 --> 04:05:21,100
Yeah, it's like the OP pairing.

5312
04:05:26,560 --> 04:05:28,240
Oh my god, is it review time?

5313
04:05:29,180 --> 04:05:30,420
They swapped the screen.

5314
04:05:31,880 --> 04:05:33,100
I see Cara.

5315
04:05:33,460 --> 04:05:35,160
Once we hear them, then we know.

5316
04:05:36,000 --> 04:05:36,280
Yeah.

5317
04:05:37,080 --> 04:05:37,880
It is Cara.

5318
04:05:38,380 --> 04:05:39,220
I love Cara.

5319
04:05:41,580 --> 04:05:43,060
Eski, what do you wanna do after this?

5320
04:05:43,380 --> 04:05:44,380
What game do you wanna play?

5321
04:05:44,720 --> 04:05:45,980
I think Doki has to play Fortnite.

5322
04:05:46,360 --> 04:05:48,020
I'm a little bit late for my sponsor.

5323
04:05:48,020 --> 04:05:48,840
You're late too now.

5324
04:05:49,240 --> 04:05:50,700
But it's okay.

5325
04:05:52,440 --> 04:05:54,800
I'm gonna get a Twitch Rivals medal.

5326
04:05:56,320 --> 04:05:57,420
You wanna try Deadlocked?

5327
04:05:58,220 --> 04:06:00,460
Yeah, let's play Deadlocked.

5328
04:06:00,760 --> 04:06:02,400
You wanna play that?

5329
04:06:03,600 --> 04:06:08,820
Oh, I do wanna try that one game that SageM and then play...

5330
04:06:08,820 --> 04:06:10,740
Oh, he's super high.

5331
04:06:10,900 --> 04:06:13,520
Every single team had a crazy good...

5332
04:06:13,520 --> 04:06:15,780
sometimes two crazy good players.

5333
04:06:15,780 --> 04:06:21,620
And the fact that the Aqua Archers, I think they just got really, really lucky with the game selection.

5334
04:06:22,860 --> 04:06:23,420
Wait,

5335
04:06:26,680 --> 04:06:27,480
wait, wait.

5336
04:06:27,820 --> 04:06:28,460
Wait, wait, wait.

5337
04:06:28,680 --> 04:06:33,460
I'm calling at strategy at just PvP in general.

5338
04:06:33,660 --> 04:06:44,520
So I think just that really helped boost their morale at least going into game 8 where BlitzHunt while they didn't hunt much better than everyone else, they were Huh?

5339
04:06:50,200 --> 04:06:52,280
I got four people.

5340
04:06:52,600 --> 04:06:53,100
Okay.

5341
04:06:54,480 --> 04:06:55,900
I got two.

5342
04:06:56,400 --> 04:06:57,360
It's good, it's good.

5343
04:07:14,660 --> 04:07:20,800
I think the main thing about the team, obviously you can point to Hanna and Aphrox, but I think everyone stepped up.

5344
04:07:20,920 --> 04:07:23,500
I mean, we saw the clip of Gumi there.

5345
04:07:23,700 --> 04:07:30,800
We know how good SK is at other video games that aren't Minecraft that are team-based to be able to perform in this atmosphere.

5346
04:07:31,560 --> 04:07:38,400
And DokiBird actually in a recent block wars had played in a shockwave and actually got the final kill.

5347
04:07:38,720 --> 04:07:39,520
That's me!

5348
04:07:40,240 --> 04:07:41,180
That's my goat.

5349
04:07:42,060 --> 04:07:43,380
That's me!

5350
04:08:03,080 --> 04:08:06,460
What the fuck?

5351
04:08:11,180 --> 04:08:14,880
She literally was there at our interview at the beginning of our show.

5352
04:08:15,100 --> 04:08:15,680
Oh, I was there.

5353
04:08:16,160 --> 04:08:23,740
They stayed under the radar enough they stayed on the edge enough to be in contention.

5354
04:08:23,740 --> 04:08:25,040
Yeah, we did that on purpose.

5355
04:08:25,760 --> 04:08:26,940
That's the scariest thing we did, man.

5356
04:08:28,420 --> 04:08:29,960
Yeah, we inted early on purpose.

5357
04:08:30,180 --> 04:08:31,880
Yeah, we inted early on purpose to scale.

5358
04:08:32,580 --> 04:08:38,100
That's gotta be a game of chicken that is a real difficult thing to maneuver.

5359
04:08:39,420 --> 04:08:40,100
Absolutely.

5360
04:08:40,560 --> 04:08:45,380
I wonder if them just like not...

5361
04:08:45,380 --> 04:08:51,600
Like, I don't think they were waiting to show their skills at all but the fact that...

5362
04:08:51,600 --> 04:08:53,580
What the hell?

5363
04:08:54,140 --> 04:08:56,640
We're getting cut in the core retweets now.

5364
04:08:56,960 --> 04:08:58,560
We're losing the interview.

5365
04:09:01,860 --> 04:09:02,540
Yeah,

5366
04:09:06,080 --> 04:09:09,320
it was... We pretended to be bad guys so they won.

5367
04:09:09,940 --> 04:09:11,300
Guys, it was all acting.

5368
04:09:13,140 --> 04:09:18,620
When I was 37th place in the race, I pretended to be bad there.

5369
04:09:36,890 --> 04:09:37,850
You're welcome.

5370
04:09:40,070 --> 04:09:40,850
Azaz!

5371
04:09:42,270 --> 04:09:42,690
Hi!

5372
04:09:43,770 --> 04:09:44,530
Oh my god!

5373
04:09:44,550 --> 04:09:44,670
Hi!

5374
04:10:09,110 --> 04:10:17,030
You can be honest because quite frankly, you are incredible but this is a scary lobby for so many people.

5375
04:10:18,670 --> 04:10:19,190
You know what?

5376
04:10:20,050 --> 04:10:23,890
I thought we had a lot of potential to do really, really, really well.

5377
04:10:24,310 --> 04:10:27,470
Like so much potential because really our team covers all the bases.

5378
04:10:28,250 --> 04:10:32,770
Specifically, Doki, Gumi, and Esker are really good at the things I'm really bad at.

5379
04:10:32,830 --> 04:10:34,930
Like the finale game, that was amazing.

5380
04:10:35,330 --> 04:10:39,530
But when it came to battle and Blitz Hunt in the final two games, like I knew.

5381
04:10:39,650 --> 04:10:41,810
I knew that we had a chance to make it to the top two.

5382
04:10:41,870 --> 04:10:43,110
I was 99% sure.

5383
04:10:43,310 --> 04:10:45,450
Because those are our best games by far.

5384
04:10:45,850 --> 04:10:48,570
So I was pretty confident at that point.

5385
04:10:49,810 --> 04:10:50,690
You know, you should have been.

5386
04:10:50,830 --> 04:10:51,690
Clearly, it showed.

5387
04:10:51,890 --> 04:10:52,190
I love it.

5388
04:10:53,890 --> 04:10:57,350
Yeah, I have a question for like especially Gumi, Esker, and Doki.

5389
04:10:57,430 --> 04:10:58,430
Like you guys...

5390
04:10:59,470 --> 04:10:59,870
Don't...

5391
04:11:01,150 --> 04:11:04,030
Y'all are playing Minecraft too much.

5392
04:11:04,030 --> 04:11:10,630
But like when you play a bunch of other games, do you think your skills in other games kind of helped to achieve this victory?

5393
04:11:11,170 --> 04:11:12,210
Let's go with Esker first.

5394
04:11:12,350 --> 04:11:12,990
Oh, definitely.

5395
04:11:14,510 --> 04:11:14,950
Yes.

5396
04:11:16,370 --> 04:11:21,110
Yeah, we definitely for like the last one because we're both playing FPS games.

5397
04:11:21,230 --> 04:11:28,390
So we were like oh, we know how to do this because at first we were like the original strat was to go in fast.

5398
04:11:28,650 --> 04:11:31,370
But Gumi, me, and Esker were like no, no, no.

5399
04:11:31,410 --> 04:11:34,770
We just plant the bomb and we wait because that's basically Valorant.

5400
04:11:35,430 --> 04:11:40,550
You just wait and wait for them to push us because we have the corner advantage.

5401
04:11:40,930 --> 04:11:43,930
So we just used our knowledge from other video games for that.

5402
04:11:44,470 --> 04:11:46,450
That's why it was so easy for us.

5403
04:11:48,990 --> 04:11:49,830
You're not Esker.

5404
04:11:50,870 --> 04:11:52,110
Oh, you said Esker.

5405
04:11:52,210 --> 04:11:53,470
Okay, Esker, you can go too.

5406
04:11:54,970 --> 04:11:55,930
Oh no.

5407
04:11:56,170 --> 04:11:56,510
Oh no.

5408
04:11:56,790 --> 04:12:02,270
You said everything that I would say.

5409
04:12:02,550 --> 04:12:03,790
Yes, it helps a lot.

5410
04:12:12,160 --> 04:12:13,820
I guess it's your turn, Gumi.

5411
04:12:14,180 --> 04:12:15,060
Yeah, it's your turn.

5412
04:12:17,180 --> 04:12:17,620
Oh.

5413
04:12:17,620 --> 04:12:18,440
Yeah, it helped.

5414
04:12:21,300 --> 04:12:22,340
Don't you said it all.

5415
04:12:22,580 --> 04:12:23,560
I have nothing more to say.

5416
04:12:23,580 --> 04:12:25,560
I think my favorite was us changing skins.

5417
04:12:29,440 --> 04:12:32,640
See, we played other video games and we knew the act of camouflage.

5418
04:12:32,900 --> 04:12:33,780
Yeah, yeah, we knew.

5419
04:12:33,940 --> 04:12:34,280
We knew.

5420
04:12:34,420 --> 04:12:39,960
We were like, oh my, that's why people, you know, grind for cosmetics because they gotta have the sweaty skins.

5421
04:12:40,320 --> 04:12:41,800
But Minecraft, it's free.

5422
04:12:42,200 --> 04:12:45,760
We can log out and change our skins whenever we want.

5423
04:12:48,360 --> 04:12:49,240
That was insane.

5424
04:12:49,340 --> 04:12:51,040
I feel like that actually helped us a lot though.

5425
04:12:52,540 --> 04:12:53,840
Because they don't know what is real.

5426
04:12:54,400 --> 04:12:55,380
Having a diamond block?

5427
04:12:55,640 --> 04:12:58,140
They don't know what you're facing, Esker.

5428
04:13:00,740 --> 04:13:03,760
They were like, which one's front and which one's back.

5429
04:13:05,940 --> 04:13:07,900
Our biggest strength is that we were just having fun.

5430
04:13:08,480 --> 04:13:09,740
We had nothing to lose.

5431
04:13:09,940 --> 04:13:10,420
No stakes.

5432
04:13:10,600 --> 04:13:11,640
We were just having a blast.

5433
04:13:11,900 --> 04:13:12,620
That's so true.

5434
04:13:33,350 --> 04:13:34,230
Our battle.

5435
04:13:34,230 --> 04:13:38,370
We had, I think, double the points than anybody else in battle.

5436
04:13:38,550 --> 04:13:40,290
Which is, I've never seen that before.

5437
04:13:40,810 --> 04:13:41,870
That was amazing.

5438
04:13:42,030 --> 04:13:47,750
I don't know if you guys know, but we showed it on the broadcast like, you had so many more capture points than everyone else.

5439
04:13:47,850 --> 04:13:51,050
The way you played it was just dominating in that fashion.

5440
04:13:51,150 --> 04:13:51,990
It was really cool to see.

5441
04:13:52,070 --> 04:13:53,010
And I think it really paid off.

5442
04:13:53,170 --> 04:13:53,750
It obviously did.

5443
04:13:54,190 --> 04:13:55,530
Yeah, that was all Antfrost.

5444
04:13:56,950 --> 04:13:57,790
That's not true.

5445
04:13:57,950 --> 04:13:58,750
That's our IGL.

5446
04:13:58,750 --> 04:13:58,870
That's our IGL.

5447
04:14:10,630 --> 04:14:11,310
Fine.

5448
04:14:20,210 --> 04:14:20,890
GG's!

5449
04:14:20,890 --> 04:14:21,590
Bye bye!

5450
04:14:24,330 --> 04:14:25,930
I'm gonna go back to Aqua channel.

5451
04:14:25,930 --> 04:14:27,890
Oh my god, they cut off all my ads.

5452
04:14:46,530 --> 04:14:51,810
Yeah, that's funny though.

5453
04:14:53,330 --> 04:14:56,210
I legitimately didn't hear that they said SK first.

5454
04:14:56,290 --> 04:14:57,690
I thought they asked all of us.

5455
04:14:57,770 --> 04:14:59,310
So I was like, no one's saying anything.

5456
04:15:01,750 --> 04:15:02,950
No one said anything.

5457
04:15:03,270 --> 04:15:03,430
You saved me.

5458
04:15:03,530 --> 04:15:04,510
I had nothing to say.

5459
04:15:04,550 --> 04:15:06,410
Yeah, because I was like, no one said anything.

5460
04:15:06,410 --> 04:15:07,750
So then I was like, okay.

5461
04:15:08,510 --> 04:15:10,010
And then they're like, you're not SK.

5462
04:15:10,110 --> 04:15:10,670
I was like, what?

5463
04:15:12,650 --> 04:15:13,790
I said that.

5464
04:15:13,790 --> 04:15:14,870
Yeah!

5465
04:15:19,510 --> 04:15:20,350
GG's, guys.

5466
04:15:22,290 --> 04:15:22,850
GG's.

5467
04:15:22,850 --> 04:15:23,710
Have fun with Fortnite.

5468
04:15:24,210 --> 04:15:26,650
Yeah, I gotta go to my Fortnite sponsor now.

5469
04:15:26,810 --> 04:15:27,770
GG's, everybody.

5470
04:15:27,930 --> 04:15:29,250
It was great playing with you guys.

5471
04:15:29,870 --> 04:15:31,670
We're the block...

5472
04:15:31,670 --> 04:15:32,530
The block girls.

5473
04:15:33,570 --> 04:15:35,610
We committed to the block.

5474
04:15:36,450 --> 04:15:36,950
What?

5475
04:15:37,030 --> 04:15:38,510
You don't like the block girls?

5476
04:15:38,930 --> 04:15:40,050
We're the block girls!

5477
04:15:43,790 --> 04:15:44,450
Fortnite man.

5478
04:15:50,190 --> 04:15:51,750
Bye-bye.

5479
04:15:51,910 --> 04:15:53,410
Bye-bye.

5480
04:15:55,790 --> 04:15:57,790
I can't believe...

5481
04:15:58,610 --> 04:15:59,790
I still can't believe...

5482
04:16:00,510 --> 04:16:00,990
Um...

5483
04:16:00,990 --> 04:16:03,350
I can't believe...

5484
04:16:03,350 --> 04:16:05,170
I got ad blocked.

5485
04:16:05,330 --> 04:16:07,190
They literally skipped my ad.

5486
04:16:09,810 --> 04:16:12,190
I can't believe it.

5487
04:16:13,790 --> 04:16:15,670
Bro, I legitimately...

5488
04:16:15,670 --> 04:16:16,530
Cause like...

5489
04:16:16,530 --> 04:16:19,570
It was like 3 seconds of no one saying anything.

5490
04:16:20,190 --> 04:16:22,150
And then like...

5491
04:16:22,150 --> 04:16:23,350
And then...

5492
04:16:24,450 --> 04:16:26,070
And then I was like...

5493
04:16:26,070 --> 04:16:27,650
Okay, I guess I'll go first.

5494
04:16:27,910 --> 04:16:28,350
And then...

5495
04:16:28,350 --> 04:16:28,750
No!

5496
04:16:31,730 --> 04:16:32,810
I was...

5497
04:16:33,580 --> 04:16:33,850
Confused.

5498
04:16:35,810 --> 04:16:36,910
That was fun.

5499
04:16:36,990 --> 04:16:39,050
Actually, I legitimately did not expect this.

5500
04:16:39,510 --> 04:16:41,250
Yeah, I didn't hear him say SK.

5501
04:16:42,190 --> 04:16:42,870
But yeah.

5502
04:16:43,050 --> 04:16:46,390
I legitimately didn't hear them say that.

5503
04:16:46,570 --> 04:16:47,170
But yeah, I'm late.

5504
04:16:47,310 --> 04:16:49,130
I'm gonna be late for Fortnite.

5505
04:16:49,570 --> 04:16:50,910
I'll start at like 6.30.

5506
04:16:51,030 --> 04:16:52,470
Cause I want a little bit of chill time.

5507
04:16:52,570 --> 04:16:53,110
Or 6.45.

5508
04:16:53,630 --> 04:16:56,050
Cause I want a little bit of chill time before I go in.

5509
04:16:57,050 --> 04:16:59,010
But I did not...

5510
04:17:00,290 --> 04:17:00,690
Expect...

5511
04:17:01,290 --> 04:17:03,550
I did not expect...

5512
04:17:04,690 --> 04:17:05,490
To win.

5513
04:17:05,710 --> 04:17:07,590
But I hope we do get the Twitch Rival medals.

5514
04:17:07,650 --> 04:17:08,370
I'm gonna message.

5515
04:17:09,270 --> 04:17:10,810
Do we get...

5516
04:17:10,810 --> 04:17:12,450
Do we get the Twitch...

5517
04:17:13,010 --> 04:17:15,470
Do we get sent Twitch Rival medals?

5518
04:17:16,330 --> 04:17:16,610
Do we get sent Twitch Rival medals?

5519
04:17:16,610 --> 04:17:16,930
For winning?

5520
04:17:19,370 --> 04:17:20,490
I messaged.

5521
04:17:20,530 --> 04:17:21,170
Cause I'm curious.

5522
04:17:21,390 --> 04:17:21,790
But yeah!

5523
04:17:22,470 --> 04:17:23,030
GG's!

5524
04:17:23,250 --> 04:17:24,230
GG's everybody!

5525
04:17:26,350 --> 04:17:26,910
GG's!

5526
04:17:28,910 --> 04:17:29,850
Chill time.

5527
04:17:30,050 --> 04:17:32,030
By the way, I have a Fortnite creator code.

5528
04:17:32,090 --> 04:17:32,710
If you guys didn't know.

5529
04:17:34,270 --> 04:17:36,550
There's 24 hours left before this is gone.

5530
04:17:36,550 --> 04:17:37,310
Gone forever!

5531
04:17:38,150 --> 04:17:39,890
So yeah, we have 24 hours left.

5532
04:17:39,970 --> 04:17:42,510
Before the gamer stuff is pulled off.

5533
04:17:42,710 --> 04:17:44,490
And you won't be able to get it after that.

5534
04:17:44,530 --> 04:17:45,310
Because it's very limited.

5535
04:17:46,630 --> 04:17:47,930
And what other things?

5536
04:17:47,970 --> 04:17:49,130
I don't really remember.

5537
04:17:49,370 --> 04:17:50,170
Oh yes, please.

5538
04:17:50,830 --> 04:17:51,810
I mean, guys.

5539
04:17:51,910 --> 04:17:52,990
Come on, guys.

5540
04:17:53,610 --> 04:17:55,490
That was FPS right there.

5541
04:17:55,610 --> 04:17:57,650
That was FPS VTuber right there.

5542
04:17:57,730 --> 04:17:58,770
For that last game.

5543
04:17:59,290 --> 04:18:02,190
Like, come on guys.

5544
04:18:02,590 --> 04:18:04,150
Did we or did we not...

5545
04:18:04,150 --> 04:18:06,230
Fucking killed so many people.

5546
04:18:06,390 --> 04:18:08,470
We carried that game so hard.

5547
04:18:08,950 --> 04:18:10,590
The last round.

5548
04:18:12,950 --> 04:18:15,290
That should be a vote right there.

5549
04:18:15,610 --> 04:18:16,930
In the VTuber awards.

5550
04:18:19,210 --> 04:18:20,550
And other than that.

5551
04:18:20,750 --> 04:18:21,010
I guess.

5552
04:18:21,090 --> 04:18:22,930
The Phantom Thief concert.

5553
04:18:23,510 --> 04:18:26,590
Is next week.

5554
04:18:26,770 --> 04:18:27,450
On Saturday.

5555
04:18:27,830 --> 04:18:29,010
So make sure.

5556
04:18:29,070 --> 04:18:29,590
Oh my gosh.

5557
04:18:29,590 --> 04:18:30,830
I'm like so...

5558
04:18:30,830 --> 04:18:33,810
My hands are like all over the place right now.

5559
04:18:34,130 --> 04:18:34,410
Where is it?

5560
04:18:34,510 --> 04:18:35,030
VTuber.

5561
04:18:35,370 --> 04:18:36,190
Oh, I can't believe.

5562
04:18:36,330 --> 04:18:38,470
I thought it was so funny that they cut.

5563
04:18:39,370 --> 04:18:42,030
That they cut up all my ass.

5564
04:18:46,610 --> 04:18:48,270
We were all like...

5565
04:18:48,270 --> 04:18:49,490
We all saw it too.

5566
04:18:49,830 --> 04:18:51,130
We were just looking at it.

5567
04:18:51,130 --> 04:18:51,710
And I was like.

5568
04:18:52,310 --> 04:18:52,850
No.

5569
04:18:55,910 --> 04:18:56,730
But anyway.

5570
04:18:57,390 --> 04:18:59,050
They said no ass.

5571
04:19:01,350 --> 04:19:02,250
But yes.

5572
04:19:03,030 --> 04:19:04,050
And we have.

5573
04:19:04,310 --> 04:19:07,390
We also are nominated for VTuber of the year.

5574
04:19:07,690 --> 04:19:09,350
I feel like that moment should have been.

5575
04:19:09,550 --> 04:19:11,370
That cements VTuber of the year for me.

5576
04:19:11,450 --> 04:19:11,830
Come on.

5577
04:19:12,250 --> 04:19:14,070
That moment should have cemented it.

5578
04:19:17,750 --> 04:19:18,870
Anyway guys.

5579
04:19:20,210 --> 04:19:21,310
I'm going to see you guys.

5580
04:19:22,510 --> 04:19:23,230
On YouTube.

5581
04:19:23,590 --> 04:19:24,630
For those who are new here.

5582
04:19:24,990 --> 04:19:25,870
My name is Doki Bird.

5583
04:19:25,970 --> 04:19:27,070
I usually stream on YouTube.

5584
04:19:27,270 --> 04:19:28,670
So please check my channel out there.

5585
04:19:29,050 --> 04:19:29,970
I would tweet out.

5586
04:19:31,550 --> 04:19:34,250
I would tweet out.

5587
04:19:35,150 --> 04:19:36,250

5588
04:19:36,370 --> 04:19:37,130
So please follow me on Twitter.

5589
04:19:37,190 --> 04:19:38,270
If you want to support me via other means.

5590
04:19:38,470 --> 04:19:39,870
There's all that other stuff I just showed.

5591
04:19:40,170 --> 04:19:41,050
As well as my store.

5592
04:19:41,430 --> 04:19:42,230
My merch store.

5593
04:19:43,330 --> 04:19:43,930
But yeah.

5594
04:19:44,010 --> 04:19:46,450
I also have a custom PC set.

5595
04:19:46,670 --> 04:19:47,090
From Hyatt.

5596
04:19:48,850 --> 04:19:50,190
So you can buy.

5597
04:19:50,250 --> 04:19:52,150
If you want a custom PC case.

5598
04:19:53,170 --> 04:19:53,970
From me.

5599
04:19:54,150 --> 04:19:54,850
That's me.

5600
04:19:55,050 --> 04:19:55,730
You can check out Hyatt.

5601
04:19:56,250 --> 04:19:57,930
I'm going to head off to Fortnite now.

5602
04:19:58,150 --> 04:19:59,490
I'll be streaming in 15 minutes.

5603
04:19:59,550 --> 04:20:00,210
As always everybody.

5604
04:20:00,330 --> 04:20:00,890
Stay hydrated.

5605
04:20:01,030 --> 04:20:01,370
Pause, check.

5606
04:20:01,590 --> 04:20:02,210
Get up and move around.

5607
04:20:02,210 --> 04:20:04,530
Head to bed.

5608
04:20:04,630 --> 04:20:05,970
Cause you deserve it.

5609
04:20:06,050 --> 04:20:07,430
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

5610
04:20:07,790 --> 04:20:08,850
Bye guys.

5611
04:20:09,270 --> 04:20:09,750
Bye.

5612
04:20:11,910 --> 04:20:12,890
Where's the ending screen?

5613
04:20:13,230 --> 04:20:13,790
Oh there it is.

5614
04:20:13,870 --> 04:20:14,170
Bye.
