00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,550
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:51,790
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,310
Sorry, I'm a little bit late today.

4
00:01:54,710 --> 00:02:00,230
Um, I couldn't... I couldn't, like, turn on my third monitor.

5
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:13,090
Because I forgot to... Um, for those who didn't know, during yesterday's stream, when I was trying to fix my game capture, one of my solutions was to literally unplug my third monitor.

6
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,610
Because sometimes, like, I can't get a fourth monitor.

7
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:22,950
I was like, oh, maybe it's because it's a monitor issue, where I can't have a fourth thing running if I have my third monitor on.

8
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:28,050
So that's why I was like, oh, maybe if I just... Maybe if I just turn off... Maybe I'll just unplug my third monitor.

9
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:28,870
Everything will work.

10
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:29,630
But it didn't work.

11
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,510
Anyway, because of that, I never plugged it back until today.

12
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:38,630
And I was trying to... For some reason, it didn't... It wasn't working at first, because I forgot...

13
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:46,070
I was like, oh, maybe if I disconnect the monitor... Um, if I just disconnect the monitor with my display settings, it will work.

14
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:54,270
And because of that, I forgot to reconnect my third monitor on my PC, because I had everything plugged, and I was like, wait a minute, why isn't it working?

15
00:02:54,410 --> 00:03:02,190
And I was like, oh my god, I forgot to connect the display back to my actual PC with my programs!

16
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:08,450
But, yeah, anyway, so I was struggling to get that work.

17
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,990
I even was like, do I restart my PC again?

18
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,950
You know, after restarting it, like, six times, do I restart it?

19
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,990
Do I restart it again?

20
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,290
Like, but it's working now!

21
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,350
It's working now.

22
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,790
I need to replace this monitor.

23
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,430
I need to replace my third monitor.

24
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:29,170
My third monitor was not meant to be used as a third monitor!

25
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:35,990
It was not meant to be used as a vertical monitor, because it's so fucking heavy.

26
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:45,230
Um, but anyway, sorry, that's why, that's why, uh, I know I've been saying I should replace it for, like, months, now.

27
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:48,370
The only reason why I haven't is because I'm lazy.

28
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:55,730
I'm lazy, and I have to do all of this by myself, and I don't really want to do all of this.

29
00:03:55,730 --> 00:04:06,170
Um, because my arms are noodle arms, and trying to plug this third monitor onto my setup was not fun at all.

30
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:06,770
Uh,

31
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,590
yeah, my vertical monitor is too fancy to be a vertical monitor.

32
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:25,350
It has to be a main monitor, but, like, but to make it a main monitor, I have to rearrange all my other monitors, and I can't, I can't, man, I can't do that.

33
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:33,710
Um, I, I, I, I, I don't want to do that.

34
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:47,790
Um, um, anyway, as I was, as I, um, was saying, um, welcome, welcome to the stream.

35
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,650
We are going to be playing Gold Gold Adventure Gold.

36
00:04:50,650 --> 00:05:08,890
Um, it is, uh, created by an indie studio named Can Can Can, I know, I like, like, the, the naming mechanism with these games, um, but it was made by an indie studio called Can Can Can A Man, uh, who made Gold Gold Adventure Gold.

37
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:22,790
Um, but from what I could tell, it is a strategy game, um, and a lot of the assets are hand-drawn, um, are hand-drawn animated and everything, so, uh, so it's gonna be interesting to see.

38
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:31,470
So, it's apparently a god-like strategy game where the main objective is to make gold.

39
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:39,710
Um, I don't know if you guys could tell, uh, I don't, I don't know if you guys could tell.

40
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:46,490
Um, but yeah, it seems, it seems really interesting.

41
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,150
I can't wait to check it out.

42
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,930
Alright, I'm booting the game for the first time, by the way, I'm going in blind.

43
00:05:50,930 --> 00:06:02,930
I figure that's, like, the best, um, the best way to, you know, uh, in, um, engage in these types of games, is to just go in blind and learn, learn the game as we go along.

44
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:04,270
Alright.

45
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,190
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

46
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,130
Alright, Gold Gold Adventure Gold.

47
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,170
Ooh, English, please.

48
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,670
Ooh, there's my god hand.

49
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,970
Oh my god, there's my evil god hand.

50
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,350
Ha ha ha ha.

51
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,710
Uh, yes.

52
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,730
Oh, oh, it booted me.

53
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,170
I was like, where did it take me?

54
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,490
But then it was like, uh, would I like to collect?

55
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:30,290
Do you understand?

56
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:31,370
No.

57
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,230
Ha ha ha ha ha.

58
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,870
You gotta buy my data from Google first.

59
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,810
Ha ha ha ha.

60
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:40,890
Ha ha ha.

61
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:44,630
Uh, no screen shake, please.

62
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:50,330
Uh, I'm just gonna make sure it's everything I want.

63
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,510
Oh wait, there's pet tools.

64
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,330
Oh my god, I get to have a pet?

65
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,510
Nice.

66
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:01,410
Um...

67
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,770
Always the correct answer.

68
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,390
The sound and dust...

69
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,350
Yes, I'd like that, please, when I tap out.

70
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:08,850
Um...

71
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,310
Oh my god, they're saying Gold Gold Adventure Gold.

72
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:11,950
Alright.

73
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:13,970
Wave defense.

74
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,370
Okay, I should learn how to play this game.

75
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,090
Oh, the art's really cute.

76
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:21,570
Alright.

78
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,250
Moving my camera first.

00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:28,750
Okay.

Okay.

Alright.

Press space to pause and unpause.

Okay, I can stop time.

Alright.

89
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,040

Oh, these are my perks.

Oh my gosh.

111
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,770
I haven't played an RTS game in so fucking long.

112
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,530
Alright, and there they go.

113
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,090
There they go.

Hey, I used to play RTS game all the time, okay?

116
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:49,490
You haven't seen me, uh, unlock my third eye yet, okay?

117
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,490
This is your pet.

118
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,410
Oh, it's my pet!

119
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,570
What does he do?

120
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:56,910
Don't worry, you're god.

121
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,350
Oh, he protects me!

122
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,510
Okay, do your thing.

00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,770
Wait, is that the enemy?

00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:03,730
Oh, it is.

00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,250
Alright, Dragoon.

129
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,150
Wait, I should be dad.

130
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,550
Dad, what the f- No.

131
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:19,090
Dad.

132
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:20,210
There you go.

133
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:21,670
I was like, wait a minute.

134
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,250
Alright, he did it!

135
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:25,890
Yippee!

Bring prey.

155
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,750
What the f- What the f- Oh, I can pet him.

156
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,070
Hello, little guy.

157

Hello, dad.

158
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,190
Hello.

159
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,950
Yeah, dad went to the dog sitter.

00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,550
I have a new...

162
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,590
I have a new dad now.

163
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,430
You can pet him.

164
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,170
10 out of 10.

165
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:23,470
As done.

166
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:24,470
Now you can reward.

167
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,150
I already did.

168
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,050
Oh, wait.

169
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,510
I can, like, brush him, too.

170
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,410
And then, what's this?

171
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,670
Oh, it's like those, like, scratcher things.

172
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:33,790
Alright, what's this?

173
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:34,230
Bad!

174
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,350
Bad dad!

175
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:36,270
Bad!

176
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:42,910
And then I'll give, like, positive reinforcements and balance it out with negative reinforcements, too.

177
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,270
Just so he's, like...

178
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,630
Just so I can increase the Stockholm Syndrome more.

179
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,370
Bad!

180
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,070
That's right!

181
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,270
You don't know what you did wrong, did you?

182
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:52,370
That's right!

183
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,590
You'll never know.

184
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,790
So you'll try so hard and please me because you'll never know what...

185
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,710
What is the bad thing you did?

186
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:00,630
Don't worry.

187
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,150
I'll love-bomb you right now.

188
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:03,050
I'll...

189
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,500
That's good.

190
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,160
Keep him on the edge.

191
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,020
Please stop being evil.

192
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,160
Now your first building is finished.

193
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,860
It's time to recruit your first spearman.

194
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:20,380
Alright.

195
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,880
Oh, that's the warrior haul.

196
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,400
Recruit.

197
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:26,820
Uh...

198
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,940
Oh my god, he looks like...

199
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,340
He's a monk.

200
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,280
He looks like a monkey.

201
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,720
Is that a monkey?

202
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:32,660
Okay.

203
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,580
Burn and unable to reach the Shining Status of Moth Knight.

204
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,060
Those who return...

205
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:37,920
Survive often.

206
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,360
Alright.

207
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,400
I'll recruit you.

208
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,800
I did it.

209
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,120
You need to take time to get recruited.

210
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:44,840
Okay.

211
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,060
New work?

212
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,180
Don't wait up.

213
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:48,800
Hello.

214
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,960
Use to select the quest.

215
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,700
Explore quest.

216
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,680
Fear quest.

217
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,660
Defend quest.

218
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,660
Okay, explore.

219
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,660
Go do your thing.

220
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,180
Alright.

221
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:00,600
Let's go.

222
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:01,920
Alright.

223
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,600
Time to love bomb him a little...

224
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,800
Paying tax...

225
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:05,860
Wait.

226
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:06,600
Wait.

227
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,300
Wait.

228
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,040
What did he ever say?

229
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:08,680
Paying?

230
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,400
Wait.

231
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,140
Has this...

232
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:10,320
Wait.

233
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:10,880
No.

234
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:11,500
There you go.

235
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:11,740
No.

236
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,620
Paying taxes.

237
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:13,440
Alright.

238
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,600
This is your job now.

239
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,060
Make sure everybody pay their taxes.

240
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:17,580
Alright?

241
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,980
If you don't...

242
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,180
If you don't...

243
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,020
That's right.

244
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,420
Everyone has to pay their taxes.

245
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,020
Let him know.

246
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,520
He has to pay his taxes.

247
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:33,840
Okay.

248
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,600
You haven't been good for too long.

249
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,260
Now, yeah.

250
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:37,760
That's why.

251
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,200
You think he lives here for free?

252
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,540
As your crew...

253
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,200
Farmhouse is being spawning around the map.

254
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,160
They grow over time.

255
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,720
Gardening more and more gold, which can be taxed.

256
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,920
Which can then be taxed.

257
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,180
You can build them manually, so be sure to protect them.

258
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,220
Right click on the border checkpoint to assign the attack quest.

259
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,480
Wait.

260
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,100
Right click?

261
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,320
Oh, there you go.

262
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:57,860
Yeah.

263
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,440
Attack that.

264
00:12:59,800 --> 00:12:59,960
Attack that.

265
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,120
Now, attack quest in place.

266
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,440
Adventures will now attempt to destroy the target.

267
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,320
Alright.

268
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,180
Cool.

269
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,060
Wait.

270
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,520
Where's dad?

271
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,940
Is he trying to collect taxes?

272
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:10,660
Did he do it?

273
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:11,960
Alright.

274
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,220
Alright, dad.

275
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:13,840
It's time.

276
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:14,460
Go.

277
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:14,500
Go.

278
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,340
Attack it.

279
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,540
Come on, dad.

280
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,380
After you finish collecting taxes.

281
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,500
It's time.

282
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,700
We love gold.

283
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,060
Give me the gold.

284
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,840
Give Doki the gold.

285
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,720
Here's my dragon tax.

286
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,800
Doki plus.

287
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,800
That's right.

288
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,820
You live at Doki land and you're not paying taxes?

289
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,800
Time to get evicted.

290
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,080
Wait.

291
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:39,800
What's this?

292
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,300
Is he going to love me unconditionally, right?

293
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,540
He'll be fine.

294
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,400
That's right.

295
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,880
My tax collector dog.

296
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,600
Don't make me angry.

297
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,500
I'll send dad over.

298
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:57,540
You're...

299
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:01,860
All right.

300
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,140
It's almost down.

301
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,220
Almost there.

302
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:06,980
Come on.

303
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,280
Just a little bit more.

304
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,140
Yay!

305
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:11,820
That's right.

306
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,360
Kill him.

307
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,700
Make sure none of his family or his lineage survive.

308
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,840
Not in Doki land.

309
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,540
If you don't pay taxes, I'll just wipe you from existence.

310
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,760
A lot of new land, which means more opportunities and more chances for adventurers to grow stronger.

311
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,740
Strong adventurers are important for the survival of your city.

312
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:31,400
Oh, hey.

313
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,100
You got something.

314
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:32,580
What the...

315
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,860
Did he just collect his tax?

316
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:35,880
All right.

317
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,220
Right-click to assign the exploration.

318
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,340
Okay.

319
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,200
Explore this.

320
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,960
Ventures are filled with both gold.

321
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,900
Experience outbreaks every night so you can reduce your strength regularly by sending...

322
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,280
Okay.

323
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm going to recruit more...

324
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,940
More guys.

325
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,220
At this point.

326
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,920
Get another guy.

327
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,820
He needs a friend.

328
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,840
And they can be like, I don't know, good roommates or something.

329
00:14:59,420 --> 00:14:59,980
That's right.

330
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,700
Get in there.

331
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:01,500
Pavel.

332
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,780
Pavel, get over there.

333
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,220
Wait.

334
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:07,780
Uh...

335
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:08,980
Pavel, no.

336
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,500
Pavel, no.

337
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,840
Get over here.

338
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,600
Pavel!

339
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,280
Oh, wait.

340
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:15,760
He did it.

341
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,860
Okay, Tana, never mind.

342
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,860
We didn't need you.

343
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,100
I'm looking out for number one.

344
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,160
Now they...

345
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,720
Let's embark on a dungeon.

346
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,120
Expeditions are harder.

347
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:25,560
More...

348
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,080
They usually require a strong group.

349
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:27,540
Okay.

350
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,700
Where is this?

351
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,620
Click on the...

352
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,640
Oh, there it is.

353
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,540
Click to browse the expedition.

354
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,080
Click here.

355
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:38,920
Click where?

356
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,020
They're not...

357
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,020
Oh, here!

358
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,940
I was like...

359
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,460
Am I not clicking it?

360
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:48,380
Alright.

361
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,660
Tanner and Pavel, we're gonna start your...

362
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,940
We're gonna start your meet cute moment right here.

363
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,660
The moment that will change your lives forever.

364
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,520
Alright.

365
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,460
There we go.

366
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,840
Wait, I can...

367
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,800
No, I can't send Dad.

368
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,580
Dad's just here to collect taxes and beat up anything that's in front of him.

369
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,040
Alright.

370
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,420
Now, let's embark on a...

371
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,440
Oh, they're traveling over.

372
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:13,960
Okay.

373
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,980
Dad's collecting my taxes as he should be.

374
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,800
Farmhouse, income...

375
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,880
Wait, this...

376
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,780
This farmhouse doesn't make me any money.

377
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,700
She's a cow, right?

378
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,440
We should eat her.

379
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:34,180
If you don't make money for me, you might as well feed...

380
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,560
Feed the kingdom in other ways.

381
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,700
Or else...

382
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:41,880
Or else...

383
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,820
That's right.

384
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:43,800
It's not cat...

385
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,080
It's not like inhumane because she's not human.

386
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,440
Turn her into a grade A steak.

387
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,240
Exactly.

388
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,100
Alright, what is he doing?

389
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:52,920
Are you collecting...

390
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,360
You're not...

391
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,080
Go back to collecting taxes.

392
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,000
No!

393
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:59,500
Make sure everybody is paying taxes.

394
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,540
That's right.

395
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,140
That's your only job.

396
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,520
Oh, I can cruise to speed.

397
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,160
Alright.

398
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,920
Boy, Tom, thank you for the super chat.

399
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:12,300
Thank you.

400
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:12,740
Thank you.

401
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,940
Anything else I could build?

402
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,320
Oh, it's just a warrior holo.

403
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:15,900
What's this?

404
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,100
I don't...

405
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,020
I haven't unlocked it yet.

406
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,460
Are they okay?

407
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,520
Do you think they'll...

408
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,560
They'll live, right?

409
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,980
There's two of them in there.

410
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,320
They'll be okay.

411
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,700
I think?

412
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,060
Yeah, see?

413
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,820
They're literally...

414
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,460
They're fine.

415
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,300
All right.

416
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,400
Where is...

417
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:36,900
Where's dad?

418
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,760
All right.

419
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,520
Let's see.

420
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,980
Okay, good.

421
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:42,720
Good job.

422
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:43,940
You're doing...

423
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,280
You're doing...

424
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,260
Good job, dad.

425
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,740
You're doing a good job.

426
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,280
You know what?

427
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,900
Go loot some treasures.

428
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,760
Go do your thing.

429
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,220
Get me some gold.

430
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,080
I demand some gold.

431
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,840
Dungeons grew progressively stronger.

432
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,880
Even if the dungeon was suppressed, it may be a good idea to hire more spearmen.

433
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,300
All right.

434
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:04,940
Might as well.

435
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,520
Oh, I only have two.

436
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,180
All right.

437
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,960
Choose a new ability?

438
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:12,620
Oh.

439
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,420
I can't even choose.

440
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,500
Oh, there it is.

441
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,680
Burn your enemies just by looking at them.

442
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,620
Your units regenerate faster when you are looking at them.

443
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,480
I don't need to regenerate.

444
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,860
I'll just hire new people.

445
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:29,800
More damage.

446
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,700
It's fine.

447
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,260
It's not inhumane because she's not human.

448
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,140
Dookie the bird.

449
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,340
George, thank you for the super chat.

450
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:40,800
Thank you.

451
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,700
Thank you.

452
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,580
Madis, thank you for the super chat.

453
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:45,860
Thank you.

454
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:46,320
Thank you.

455
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,440
Here's my dookie tax.

456
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:51,060
Can I get you to sing me a happy birthday for not committing dookie tax evasion?

457
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,240
Of course, Madis.

458
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,260
Thank you for the super chat.

459
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:53,560
Thank you.

460
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,080
Thank you.

461
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,840
Happy birthday to you.

462
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,920
Happy birthday to you.

463
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,540
Happy birthday, dear Madduff.

464
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,200
Happy birthday to you.

465
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:02,580
Yay.

466
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,940
Pay your taxes.

467
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,420
But only the Doki tax.

468
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,000
All the other taxes don't really matter.

469
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,280
Treasure from Trevor.

470
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,900
Thank you for the Akasupa.

471
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:15,980
Thank you, thank you.

472
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,140
Tax is paid.

473
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,560
Get Dad a nice bag of treats and have a lovely day.

474
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,780
Thank you for the Akasupa, Trevor.

475
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,000
Thank you, thank you.

476
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,280
Alright, Howard, even while simply looking at it will make them stronger.

477
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,580
Ooh, they just like to be looked at, I see.

478
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,360
Alright, cool.

479
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:38,060
Your final tool in keeping your city standing, place the defense quest on anything you want to defend it.

480
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,740
Once someone claims a bounty, its reward will slowly drain them away.

481
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,940
The adventurers will patrol the defense quest vicinity until it runs dry.

482
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,440
Oh, okay.

483
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,120
Defense quest.

484
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,160
Oh, here, okay.

485
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,620
Well, obviously we'll defend here.

486
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,740
Because, like... Wait, who the fuck is Whiskers?

487
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,080
No matter the... You should be able to face...

488
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,180
Who is Whiskers?

489
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,060
Oh, I'm looking at them.

490
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:07,800
That's right.

491
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,380
I'm looking at you.

492
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,560
What are you gonna do?

493
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,960
Oh my god, my crops!

494
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:15,700
No!

495
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,160
Don't worry, I'm looking at him.

496
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,140
Don't worry.

497
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:18,660
No!

498
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,060
Who would feed them?

499
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,600
Oh my god.

500
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,320
Defend here.

501
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,260
No!

502
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,940
I don't understand!

503
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,460
I'm looking at him!

504
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,360
I...

505
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,580
Yay, I did it!

506
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,500
I...

507
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,820
Not the crops!

508
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,120
Alright.

509
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,480
Okay, now...

510
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,420
Continue game.

511
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,380
Is this the tutorial?

512
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,520
Or...

513
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:40,920
Move...

514
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,380
Oh, wait.

515
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,580
Oh, it...

516
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,400
Wait, what?

517
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,220
Is this new?

518
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,540
Oh no, this is new.

519
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,240
I was like, who...

520
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,360
Okay, this is new.

521
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,800
Oh, this is old.

522
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,020
Sorry.

523
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:51,540
This is old.

524
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,360
Okay, new game.

525
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,640
Survive six days.

526
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,120
Or in this dungeon will only spawn if waves.

527
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:58,940
Neglected scent.

528
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,420
I feel like I'm ready for famine.

529
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,100
Now famine is all British.

530
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,020
Don't worry.

531
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,240
We have all the cow ladies we can eat.

532
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,280
Guys, don't worry.

533
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,460
Immortal being of legend.

534
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,060
Presumed extinct.

535
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,620
Where the rock with face painted on it.

536
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,460
Alright, guys.

537
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,200
Who should we get as our pet?

538
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,440
A little...

539
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:24,500
Immortal being of...

540
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,320
A little immortal being or a rock?

541
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,680
But Doki has a funny face painted on it.

542
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,160
We get the...

543
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,940
The literal immortal being.

544
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,140
You wanna learn a basis before you start?

545
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:42,560
No.

546
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,640
Alright, I feel like I've learned enough.

547
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:45,580
Alright.

548
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,320
Dad.

549
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I'm pretty sure...

550
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,360
Oh, I can rename all of them.

551
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:50,700
Um...

552
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:50,960
Karen.

553
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,420
Alright.

554
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,260
Our name...

555
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,040
Dragoon.

556
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,440
Dragoon.

557
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:57,500
Alright.

558
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,000
Let's do this.

559
00:21:59,120 --> 00:21:59,560
Fence.

560
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,020
Oh my god.

561
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,080
I can build a fence?

562
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,400
I can build a forge?

563
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,300
Do I have enough gold for that?

564
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,080
I can build a market?

565
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,500
I don't think I have enough...

566
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:07,940
Gold.

567
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,580
Wait, no.

568
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:09,940
I do.

569
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,260
Inn.

570
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,160
I'll build a forge first.

571
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,340
Alright.

572
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,780
And then I'll do an inn.

573
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:17,300
Alright.

574
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,160
Um...

575
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,460
Adam, thank you for the super chat.

576
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:21,780
Thank you.

577
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,300
Thank you.

578
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,540
Finally, I'm not on night shift.

579
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,500
So I can watch my Oshi live.

580
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,720
I waited so long.

581
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,120
Thank you for the super chat, Adam.

582
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:29,540
Thank you.

583
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,320
Thank you.

584
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:31,600
What's this?

585
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,620
Oh, it's a border checkpoint.

586
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,260
Where's dad?

587
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:34,720
Alright, dad.

588
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,640
Get over there.

589
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,440
Attack this.

590
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:39,660
That's right.

591
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,820
We need the land so we can expand.

592
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:46,620
Alright.

593
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,520
We have Dragoon and...

594
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,500
Wait, who's this guy?

595
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,800
Who's she?

596
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,960
Oh, is this for the forge?

597
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,760
Oh, it's so cute.

598
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,860
Look at this little guy.

599
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:55,680
He's just...

600
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,340
Just blowing on it.

601
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,220
These are your goals.

602
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,920
Completing them gives you perks.

603
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,540
Okay, destroying that.

604
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,260
Alright.

605
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,700
We gotta get a perk real quick.

606
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,600
Rangers Guild.

607
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,200
Gobble.

608
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:07,980
Hideout.

609
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:09,960
Warrior Hall.

610
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:10,860
Wait.

611
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,020
I can be a gob...

612
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:12,260
Wait.

613
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,220
If...

614
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,640
If we get goblins...

615
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,500
We can get gold.

616
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,520
Ha ha ha ha ha.

617
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,200
Ha ha ha.

618
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,580
Recruit holy mooligans to smite your foes.

619
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,380
Oh my god.

620
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,840
More cow ladies, please.

621
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,140
We can go gobble mode.

622
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:30,820
Exactly.

623
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,260
Going out with a blast.

624
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,180
Adventures with mana explode on death.

625
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,900
Dealing two extra manas.

626
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,820
Your adventures deal six plus.

627
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,620
And gain more gold.

628
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,900
But you gotta always get more gold.

629
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,040
Holy cow lady.

630
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:45,560
You know what?

631
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,940
Let's get the moon...

632
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,580
What's got?

633
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,620
The moonistry?

634
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:50,840
Alright.

635
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,780
Let's get the moonistry in here.

636
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,440
The moonistry.

637
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,720
And then...

638
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,340
What else?

639
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,100
Do we get?

640
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:57,360
Wait.

641
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,120
Where's my gobble?

642
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,200
Oh, there we go.

643
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,140
Gobble hideout.

644
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:00,800
That's right.

645
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,120
And then gobble hideout too.

646
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,360
Let's get our moonistry in here.

647
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:08,540
Uh...

648
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,820
In farmhouse.

649
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,700
Can I do anything?

650
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,440
With my farmhouse?

651
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,400
What can they do?

652
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,040
Select perks.

653
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,320
Perks encyclopedia.

654
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,400
Construct new roads.

655
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:19,640
Wait.

656
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,500
I can make roads?

657
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,480
That's fine.

658
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,500
They don't need a road.

659
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,720
Let's just go to your god beast.

660
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,060
Toggle structure clipping.

661
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,680
Okay, he's still...

662
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,900
He's still doing his thing.

663
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,860
Oh, apparently...

664
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,460
Apparently...

665
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,530
Is it her that's voiced by...

666
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,080
Oh!

667
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,480
Apparently, the Mooladin...

668
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,260
This is Lily Pichu.

669
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,460
Apparently.

670
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:48,740
That's her.

671
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:51,640
The...

672
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,980
I shouldn't say that, but...

673
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,520
I shouldn't say that to Lily.

674
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,240
Okay.

675
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,280
The first thing in my head was that...

676
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,780
The big city...

677
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,860
It's Lily...

678
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,700
That's just...

679
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,360
Lily Pichu.

680
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,520
Let's call her Lily...

681
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,560
There you go.

682
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,520
Oh, wait.

683
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,640
Who the heck is Kaja?

684
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:18,700
Who's she...

685
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:18,880
Oh!

686
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,500
She's from the...

687
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,340
She's the Gobbles!

688
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,420
Alright.

689
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:22,840
Nice.

690
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:23,640
Wait.

691
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,460
Have you started collecting your taxes yet?

692
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,540
No.

693
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,040
Seriously?

694
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:29,800
Yay!

695
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:30,820
Go, Lily!

696
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,760
Okay.

697
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,460
And then...

698
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,420
Kaja will be...

699
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:34,880
Max...

700
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:42,160
All right.

701
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,300
Let's see.

702
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,180
The Munistry.

703
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,480
Are you making any...

704
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,400
Income for me?

705
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,900
No, you're not.

706
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:48,320
Okay.

707
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,860
There's the Gobble Hideout.

708
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,800
Can I get...

709
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,960
Recruit at least four units.

710
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,520
It's the Tax Man here.

711
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,800
I need to collect my taxes soon.

712
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:00,460
I...

713
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,460
Oh, wait.

714
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,240
Oh, my God.

715
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,080
She's collecting...

716
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:06,520
That's right.

717
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,680
Taxed them silver.

718
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,120
That's right.

719
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,180
Make sure they know what's good for them.

720
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,080
All right.

721
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:14,920
You earned...

722
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,120
Yes.

723
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,280
I want to redeem my reward.

724
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,880
The Tax Man is coming.

725
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,020
Gain more experience.

726
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,720
Vaults of Lightning fall.

727
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:25,020
The more spells you have cast, the more casting your spell costs.

728
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,000
Gain more experience from...

729
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,180
Okay.

730
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,120
Let's get less gold from that.

731
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,200
God.

732
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:30,720
I love...

733
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,240
That's right.

734
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,480
The Rat Man is here.

735
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:34,800
That's right.

736
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,900
He's always watching you.

737
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,620
He's always here to collect the taxes.

738
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,260
Um...

739
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,100
How do I...

740
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,540
How do I access the Forge?

741
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,220
Oh, there it is.

742
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,460
Dwellers.

743
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,120
Oh, hey, look.

744
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,420
Max Mofo is inside.

745
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,120
There's daggers for...

746
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:55,960
Oh, do I have enough...

747
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,180
Oh, I have so much money.

748
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,500
We'll upgrade that, actually.

749
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,360
Uh...

750
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,460
Why are you so confused, Dad?

751
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,100
Why are you so confused?

752
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,760
Pay your taxes.

753
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,620
Why are you so confused?

754
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,800
Stop being confused and get the taxes in.

755
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,540
But don't worry.

756
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:16,120
I'll love bomb you so you'll stay with me forever.

757
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,300
That's right.

758
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,180
Uh...

759
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,000
Let's see.

760
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,940
Is anyone already doing it?

761
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,900
Pelvis red.

762
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,260
That's so messed up.

763
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,040
Like, what can I build?

764
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,940
And that's everything.

765
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,160
Oh, I should build a market.

766
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,480
Claiming that whole...

767
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,580
Oh, it passively generates gold.

768
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,220
I like that.

769
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,280
We'll put it here.

770
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,180
Alright.

771
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,960
Oh, there's the farm.

772
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:46,480
Don't worry.

773
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,200
Silver is here to collect more taxes.

774
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,440
Let's recruit more cow ladies.

775
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,820
I can recruit two.

776
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,540
Am I recruiting?

777
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,040
Do I have enough?

778
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,200
She vows to protect this.

779
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:58,420
Wait.

780
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,560
Why can I get another one?

781
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,480
I don't understand.

782
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,620
Why can I have more than one cow lady?

783
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,800
I don't understand.

784
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,520
I can have more...

785
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,600
Oh, I can't even have more goblins?

786
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,000
Wait.

787
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,320
Did I max it up?

788
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,520
Recruit one out of three.

789
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,760
Oh, I must have need...

790
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,340
Do I need more inns or something?

791
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,520
I might need another inn.

792
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,060
Maybe.

793
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,400
I'll construct another inn just in case.

794
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:27,600
Uh.

795
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:29,840
Oh.

796
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,020
Increaser.

797
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,580
Allows place for relax.

798
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:34,040
No.

799
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:34,480
Wait.

800
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,280
Am I keeping them satisfied?

801
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,020
What do you mean?

802
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,140
I have an inn?

803
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,020
I have a farmhouse.

804
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:44,980
And I have a market.

805
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,720
What else do they need?

806
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,020
Oh.

807
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,040
Destroy a catacomb.

808
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,540
Is there any dungeons nearby?

809
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:56,530
Okay, let's just attack this, actually.

810
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,390
I don't know if there's any...

811
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:00,310
Yeah, there's no dungeons near me right now.

812
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:01,030
Wait.

813
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,710
Who the heck is Stitches?

814
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,830
Who's living next to my house?

815
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:08,030
Wally?

816
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,470
Who lives here?

817
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:12,930
This is my land!

818
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:18,070
Wait.

819
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,210
What the f...

820
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,030
Who's...

821
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,190
Who is my neighboring?

822
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:27,850
Who are my neighbors?

823
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,390
I gotta get them out of here.

824
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:31,430
How dare they?

825
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:34,070
Wait.

826
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:34,550
I'm gonna...

827
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:37,670
Whatever.

828
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:38,370
They can...

829
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:38,690
Whatever.

830
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:39,530
They can do that.

831
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:42,550
Who are my neighbors?

832
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,070
How dare they be next to me?

833
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:45,590
This is my land.

834
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:48,630
I can't see them.

835
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:48,990
Okay.

836
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:51,930
Yeah, this is true.

837
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,390
But not enough money?

838
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:54,730
Is that it?

839
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:55,810
Are they very expensive?

840
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:59,210
Are my cow ladies very expensive?

841
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:01,910
Alright, Maximofo.

842
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:03,470
What are you gonna do?

843
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,300
Good.

844
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:08,940
You explored.

845
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:09,700
Wow.

846
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,940
I gave him money and...

847
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,540
He took that and just left.

848
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:14,960
Okay.

849
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,680
Okay.

850
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,880
He got his gold and he's happy.

851
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:20,580
He's fine.

852
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,340
He's fine with that.

853
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,040
I'm like...

854
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,000
That's all you're gonna explore?

855
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:31,960
Job's done.

856
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:32,600
Job done.

857
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,300
Alright.

858
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,400
Go, Lily.

859
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:38,820
Go.

860
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,320
Beat him up.

861
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,440
That's right.

862
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,440
You got this, Lily.

863
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,860
Did that leave her?

864
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,060
That's like...

865
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:45,460
Job done.

866
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,040
There's more to this, Dad.

867
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,740
Dad just literally left Lily.

868
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,920
She'll be fine.

869
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,140
I mean, she is pretty strong, though.

870
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,160
Oh my god.

871
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:03,960
Look at her go.

872
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,920
She's very strong.

873
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,100
Oh my god.

874
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:08,700
Alright.

875
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,280
You unlock this chest for me?

876
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:12,940
What's in it?

877
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,580
Oh, I'll never know, I guess.

878
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,220
Uh...

879
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:20,160
Well, I'm slowly, passively collecting my...

880
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,660
Who the fuck is Wally?

881
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,540
And what is he doing on my land?

882
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,440
Someone get Wally out of here.

883
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:33,060
I wonder if I have to build more.

884
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,560
I want to build an inn just to test the stereo.

885
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,740
Let's see.

886
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:39,740
Forge.

887
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,120
Um...

888
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,800
Yeah, I'm going to build another inn just to test the stereo.

889
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,280
See if I can...

890
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,660
Bro is doing some tax evasion.

891
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,900
You cannot evade the rat.

892
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,940
The rat is always watching.

893
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,380
Alright.

894
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:57,480
Uh...

895
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,620
Tax Wally.

896
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:58,920
Yeah.

897
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:03,040
If he's on my land, I should be allowed to tax him.

898
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:03,820
That's right.

899
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,680
Kill Wally.

900
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,060
Can I rename Wally?

901
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,900
Like, I'm just going to rename this guy, too.

902
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,020
That's right.

903
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:11,940
Oh my god.

904
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,860
He's coming over.

905
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:13,360
That's right.

906
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,480
Get Wally out of here.

907
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,540
Oh my god.

908
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,160
Wally's trying to kill Max's house.

909
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,620
Get him.

910
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,740
Get him, Max!

911
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,440
Alright.

912
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,580
That's fine.

913
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,600
Oh, I knew it.

914
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,000
I...

915
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,560
Wait, no.

916
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,680
Actually, it doesn't work like that.

917
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,280
Wait, what?

918
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:31,540
It's okay.

919
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,820
Dad's here to help, too.

920
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,020
Oh, wait.

921
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,240
What is he doing with that...

922
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:36,860
With his head?

923
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,360
Oh my god.

924
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,460
That's this man's head.

925
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,180
No taxation without representation.

926
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:44,760
That's right.

927
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,020
You see that, Dragoons?

928
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,040
That's what's going to happen to you.

929
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,280
Don't pay your taxes.

930
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,260
I'm going to make your skull into a nice...

931
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,520
Nice cup.

932
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,700
Don't attack their home, too.

933
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,200
Actually, no.

934
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:58,940
Maybe don't.

935
00:32:59,080 --> 00:32:59,700
Actually, no.

936
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:01,420
Actually...

937
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,280
How do I get rid of this?

938
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,040
Oh, maybe don't.

939
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,880
Oh my god.

940
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,200
Okay, maybe...

941
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,220
Okay, Lily might die.

942
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,360
Oh, Lily's gonna die.

943
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,240
How do I...

944
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,120
There we go.

945
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:22,900
Lily, leave.

946
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,140
Oh...

947
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,020
Wait, Dad.

948
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,420
She'll be fine, right?

949
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,080
She's fine.

950
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,240
Look, she's fine.

951
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,380
Dad will be okay, too.

952
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:45,860
I believe.

953
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:46,600
She...

954
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,720
And there's that legendary immortal.

955
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,420
So she should be fine.

956
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,260
I believe.

957
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:55,440
Okay, we might need more people.

958
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,780
Can't recruit, though.

959
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,100
I don't know why.

960
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:04,260
Yeah, maybe a 1v3 was not it.

961
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,220
It's okay.

962
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:05,700
Look, see?

963
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,660
Everything's fine.

964
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,320
Everything is okay.

965
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,580
How do I get rid of the spear thing, though?

966
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,340
Oh, it's...

967
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,940
Oh, it says 10 seconds.

968
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:19,280
Okay.

969
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:20,660
Well...

970
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,380
Goodbye, Max.

971
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,260
Wave incoming?

972
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:24,460
Wait.

973
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,440
Wait, I'm not ready.

974
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,160
Oh, I got another goblin!

975
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,340
Wait, how did I get you?

976
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,320
Oh my god, I got another goblin!

977
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,100
Wait, how do I get another one?

978
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,400
Oh, I got two...

979
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,700
Two cow ladies, too!

980
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,680
Okay, I'm ready.

981
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,600
I'm ready for this.

982
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,140
That's it.

983
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:47,780
I'm ready.

984
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,000
I don't know how that happened, but I'm ready.

985
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:53,480
Oh.

986
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,540
Oh, Dad.

987
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,280
That's going in by himself.

988
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:56,920
Dad, no.

989
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,360
Dad, that's a bad idea.

990
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,420
That is a very bad idea.

991
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,000
He's like, okay.

992
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,680
Like, okay.

993
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:07,540
I'll stop.

994
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,460
How do I get duration?

995
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,780
Maybe like that?

996
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,360
I want to, like...

997
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,820
Get the fear thing out.

998
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,440
Uh...

999
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,520
You know what?

1000
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,420
I think we can...

1001
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,240
Start the fight, right?

1002
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,780
I think everybody's ready.

1003
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,600
Right?

1004
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,200
I have enough.

1005
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,620
Should be fine.

1006
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,460
Should be okay.

1007
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,300
And I'm, like...

1008
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,320
Passively generating income, too.

1009
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:40,540
Dwellers.

1010
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:41,720
Completed.

1011
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,520
All defeated enemies drop.

1012
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:44,880
Oh.

1013
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:45,380
Income.

1014
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,020
Improves income for all farms.

1015
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:47,700
I like that.

1016
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,340
Alright.

1017
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:49,980
More gold.

1018
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,140
More gold for me.

1019
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,380
If I can recruit one more...

1020
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,600
Oh, I guess they, like, passed.

1021
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,260
I can...

1022
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,440
I have to wait now?

1023
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,360
Maybe?

1024
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,880
I'm pretty sure.

1025
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,720
I should name them to get attached.

1026
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:03,660
You're right.

1027
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,140
I'll name them after you guys.

1028
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:06,460
Uh...

1029
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,540
Who gave me that idea?

1030
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,520
They can't be replaced.

1031
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,320
You're right, Jordan.

1032
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,100
You're now a big titty cat lady.

1033
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:21,880
Alright.

1034
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,000
This is fine.

1035
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:23,520
Where's dad?

1036
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:24,840
Dad?

1037
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,960
Dad, get over here.

1038
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:28,820
Why...

1039
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,540
Why are you depressed?

1040
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,380
Dad fled from danger.

1041
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,480
Dad saw Gouda and their face deserve prepared...

1042
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:35,920
Wait.

1043
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,000
What made you depressed?

1044
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,040
I don't understand.

1045
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,260
Why are you depressed?

1046
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:41,460
Why?

1047
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,500
Don't be depressed.

1048
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:44,140
Here.

1049
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,400
Is it because you're paying...

1050
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:46,600
Okay.

1051
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:46,760
Here.

1052
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,380
Buy a beer.

1053
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:48,640
Here.

1054
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,040
Buy...

1055
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,320
If you're...

1056
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,460
If you're depressed...

1057
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:52,540
Here.

1058
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,360
Buy a beer.

1059
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,600
Everything will be okay.

1060
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,260
Just drink away your problems.

1061
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,260
It's okay.

1062
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,100
I hate that.

1063
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,780
On to greater pastors.

1064
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:01,860
Wait.

1065
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,040
Why is he depressed?

1066
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,700
Everybody else is happy.

1067
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,080
I don't...

1068
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,120
What happened?

1069
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,020
Thirsty?

1070
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:08,960
Wait.

1071
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:09,740
You're...

1072
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,840
Euphoric.

1073
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,380
You're depressed too?

1074
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,220
What did you...

1075
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,980
You really were just a boy.

1076
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,880
How are you depressed?

1077
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,900
You were just a boy.

1078
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,020
For pure talk.

1079
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,100
Don't make him an alcoholic.

1080
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:25,840
Alcoholic.

1081
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,300
Blackfire.

1082
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,680
Thank you for the five gifted chips.

1083
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:32,360
Thank you.

1084
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,060
Thank you.

1085
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,540
I don't understand.

1086
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,900
Why are you depressed?

1087
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,200
I did so much.

1088
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,540
You were just born.

1089
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,220
Here you go.

1090
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,780
Can't be depressed when I'm scratching you.

1091
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,060
That's right.

1092
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,020
Yeah.

1093
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,480
You can't be depressed.

1094
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:51,940
Look.

1095
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,100
Look at all the love I was giving you.

1096
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:55,280
Alright.

1097
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,520
It's fine.

1098
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,500
Everything is...

1099
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,340
Oh, I need more perks.

1100
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,700
What did I get?

1101
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,440
Kills nearby creatures.

1102
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,660
Recruit spearmen.

1103
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,240
Oh, we should get that, actually.

1104
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,040
And then we'll build a well.

1105
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,260
And...

1106
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,000
We'll put it...

1107
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,640
We'll put it here.

1108
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:12,820
Alright, dragoons.

1109
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,440
Build that.

1110
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,740
And then if I...

1111
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:17,420
After I kill the catacomb, I should get another quest.

1112
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:18,400
Yeah.

1113
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,980
Wait, I fell in 36 hours?

1114
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,600
Build 16...

1115
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,460
Structures?

1116
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,000
Wait, it's been 33.

1117
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,240
It's been 33 hours.

1118
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,660
How do I build 36...

1119
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,440
16...

1120
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:30,640
Stru...

1121
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,340
How...

1122
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,300
Okay.

1123
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,700
I lost a chance to hit twice.

1124
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,720
I have a chance to hit...

1125
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,820
Oh, I just got...

1126
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,640
Summons a pair of wolves to your aid.

1127
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:41,820
We'll do...

1128
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,800
This one.

1129
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:44,500
Um...

1130
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,880
Is there anything cool around here?

1131
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,700
Yeah, it's everything, right?

1132
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,180
You know what?

1133
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,100
Kill this guy.

1134
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:50,880
Dude.

1135
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,140
Just for the sake of it.

1136
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:52,860
Just kill him.

1137
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,560
Doesn't deserve to live.

1138
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,420
That's right.

1139
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:59,320
Fuck that guy in particular as well.

1140
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:00,340
Uh...

1141
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,440
Wait.

1142
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,640
Wait, what...

1143
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,440
What is that?

1144
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,660
Wait, what the...

1145
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,800
No, my taxman!

1146
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,480
Someone save my taxman!

1147
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:10,760
How...

1148
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,020
No!

1149
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,060
Get...

1150
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:12,380
No!

1151
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:12,840
Run!

1152
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,520
Oh, my God.

1153
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,240
Oh, my God.

1154
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:17,040
I...

1155
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:17,220
Let...

1156
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:17,480
Run!

1157
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,040
Run!

1158
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:18,860
Oh, my God.

1159
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:19,500
Get in there!

1160
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,580
Save the taxman!

1161
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,580
We'll never be able to tax...

1162
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:26,880
Tax!

1163
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:27,860
No!

1164
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:28,840
My crops!

1165
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,060
Oh, my God.

1166
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:31,660
My crops.

1167
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,080
Okay.

1168
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:32,980
We gotta get that.

1169
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,560
And then we gotta get that.

1170
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,420
And then...

1171
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,240
Oh, this is bad.

1172
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,060
Oh, this is bad.

1173
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,120
Oh, no.

1174
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,460
This is so bad.

1175
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,400
Where are my others?

1176
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,740
Where are my men?

1177
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,180
Where are my goblins?

1178
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:44,980
Wait.

1179
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,120
Where are my goblins?

1180
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,800
Oh, my God.

1181
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:49,860
Where is everything?

1182
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,000
Oh, my God.

1183
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:51,380
Please.

1184
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,020
Please.

1185
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,420
Someone save my farm.

1186
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:54,680
Please.

1187
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,460
Protect the cow women.

1188
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:57,780
If anything.

1189
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,960
Protect the cow women.

1190
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,900
They are the most important thing.

1191
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,420
Oh, my God.

1192
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,160
I was not paying attention.

1193
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,560
Oh, my God.

1194
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:11,980
Okay.

1195
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:12,340
Wait.

1196
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:12,700
Okay.

1197
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,120
We gotta build another...

1198
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:17,720
We gotta build another moon story soon.

1199
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,280
Don't worry.

1200
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:18,800
It's fine.

1201
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,700
It's fine.

1202
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,280
We'll build another...

1203
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:22,660
No!

1204
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:25,820
No!

1205
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,600
Who the fuck is Jordan?

1206
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,120
Oh, wait.

1207
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:28,480
Oh, yeah.

1208
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:28,900
I forgot.

1209
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:32,600
Wait.

1210
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,040
Is dad still alive?

1211
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,220
Oh, dad's still alive.

1212
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:35,520
Okay.

1213
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:36,020
That's fine.

1214
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,560
Dad's dealing with this.

1215
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,180
Oh, my God.

1216
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,300
There's so many...

1217
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,340
So much death.

1218
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,160
It's okay.

1219
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,820
The tax man is still alive.

1220
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:43,520
I...

1221
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,240
I was not...

1222
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,080
I was not paying attention.

1223
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:51,440
I was too busy getting gold.

1224
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,000
Oh, my God.

1225
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,640
No, not the crops.

1226
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,120
No.

1227
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,600
My farm.

1228
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,920
I was too busy getting gold.

1229
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:02,720
Oh, wait.

1230
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,660
Jordan's back, guys.

1231
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:04,180
Look at that.

1232
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:04,780
He's okay.

1233
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,160
It was just a flesh wound.

1234
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,820
He's okay, guys.

1235
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,920
He's okay.

1236
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:11,820
All right.

1237
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:13,520
It's fine.

1238
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,920
Everything is okay.

1239
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,640
We just gotta attack.

1240
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:18,280
It's okay.

1241
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,240
Everything is okay.

1242
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,100
We got another...

1243
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,780
We got another moon story.

1244
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:23,940
It's fine.

1245
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,400
We'll build another fountain, too.

1246
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,260
Just in case.

1247
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,100
Wait.

1248
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,600
Do I have room for...

1249
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,340
Yeah.

1250
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,660
We'll build a fountain here, too.

1251
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,060
And then...

1252
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:34,540
Oh, my God.

1253
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,580
So much death.

1254
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,040
So much death.

1255
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,220
Cow lady.

1256
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:41,880
No.

1257
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,860
We still have...

1258
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:43,340
Wait.

1259
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,240
Oh, my cow lady.

1260
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:44,440
No.

1261
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,280
We still have...

1262
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,780
We still have our cow lady.

1263
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:47,100
See?

1264
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:48,840
She's still here.

1265
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,920
Lily's still alive.

1266
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:50,380
Look.

1267
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:50,640
See?

1268
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,600
And Jordan, too.

1269
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:52,700
You're okay.

1270
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,120
You didn't die.

1271
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,280
I have more goblins?

1272
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,280
I'd like more goblins, please.

1273
00:41:59,400 --> 00:41:59,660
All right.

1274
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:00,620
See?

1275
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,840
Everything is fine.

1276
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,440
There's nothing to worry.

1277
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:03,700
See?

1278
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,120
Our...

1279
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,520
Our moon story is back.

1280
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,240
Let's just make another one.

1281
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,480
I feel like the cows are really strong in general.

1282
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:13,340
Uh...

1283
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,280
Wait.

1284
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,920
How do I fix this?

1285
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,380
Oh, rebuild.

1286
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:19,820
Okay.

1287
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:20,960
We'll rebuild your home.

1288
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:21,960
Wait.

1289
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:22,800
Can I promote her?

1290
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,040
Let's get moving.

1291
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,600
How do I promote her?

1292
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,320
Steadfast.

1293
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,220
I don't think I can.

1294
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:29,660
Wait.

1295
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,460
She's a healer?

1296
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,620
Oh, my gosh.

1297
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:33,920
She is not DPS.

1298
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:34,960
I...

1299
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,660
I just...

1300
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,980
I just noticed she is not DPS.

1301
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:41,940
Uh...

1302
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:43,920
All right.

1303
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,240
See, guys?

1304
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,860
We did it.

1305
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,380
I brought the mirror.

1306
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,400
I don't understand how to...

1307
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,340
Guys, you know how...

1308
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,260
Uh...

1309
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:54,740
Wait.

1310
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,040
What?

1311
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,040
Wait.

1312
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,220
What do you mean wave incoming?

1313
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:58,180
Oh, my God.

1314
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:58,540
Jordan.

1315
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,320
Jordan, you fucking idiot.

1316
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,340
Oh, my God.

1317
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:02,620
Okay.

1318
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:03,900
We gotta defend here.

1319
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,680
That's all they're coming from, right?

1320
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:06,620
Yeah.

1321
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,800
That's the only way they're coming.

1322
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,780
Oh, my God.

1323
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,080
And we have to defend here.

1324
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:11,980
Oh, my God.

1325
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:12,380
Okay.

1326
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:13,720
I should have built more goblins.

1327
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,340
I'm gonna go build more goblins right now.

1328
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:16,860
I'm...

1329
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,400
I'm gonna build more goblins right now.

1330
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:21,420
It's fine.

1331
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:22,540
It's fine.

1332
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:23,140
Oh, my God.

1333
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:23,340
No.

1334
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:24,680
They're destroying their homes again.

1335
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,940
We gotta protect them.

1336
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,780
Okay, I see him.

1337
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,320
I see the tarantulas, the vile.

1338
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:33,680
But it's okay.

1339
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:36,220
It's only... It's okay.

1340
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,160
Everybody's defending.

1341
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,920
See, we have a heal circle, too.

1342
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,180
I require more goblins.

1343
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,020
We need more goblins.

1344
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,460
What else can I build?

1345
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:52,700
I feel like there's nothing else to really build other than, like, upgrades and stuff.

1346
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:54,540
Produce daggers.

1347
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:59,300
Produce dark swords for heretic mouladans.

1348
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:00,260
Alright, you know what?

1349
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:01,060
Fuck it.

1350
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:07,940
I don't have... I don't have the perk for spearmen.

1351
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,380
Because I didn't care much about it.

1352
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,400
Faults fall over.

1353
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,220
The more spells you cast, the more power.

1354
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,460
Summon a pair of wolves.

1355
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:17,040
You know what?

1356
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:17,600
Fuck it.

1357
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:18,800
Let's get some wolves in here.

1358
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,600
Wait, but how do I summon wolves?

1359
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:24,700
Wait, one out of three?

1360
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,120
What happened to my second cow... No, okay.

1361
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:28,720
Yeah, I have three cow ladies now.

1362
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:30,300
How do I get more?

1363
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:31,940
Do you guys know how I get more goblins?

1364
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,900
I feel like you guys might have read more than me.

1365
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:40,920
I'm a little confused how to get more goblins.

1366
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:43,400
Yeah, fuck it.

1367
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,520
We're having wolves now.

1368
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,340
Okay, defend.

1369
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,040
So how do I delete the quest?

1370
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:49,900
Oh, here.

1371
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,640
Okay, well...

1372
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,940
I mean, we'll just keep it there.

1373
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:56,520
You build more of their structures.

1374
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,820
Oh, thank you for the raid.

1375
00:44:58,940 --> 00:44:59,160
Thank you.

1376
00:44:59,300 --> 00:44:59,860
Thank you.

1377
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,240
I can't read.

1378
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:02,920
What do they want?

1379
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:07,480
Just build another...

1380
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,280
Oh, do they want more ends?

1381
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,220
More...

1382
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:11,360
More ends, maybe?

1383
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,160
What would I need defenses for?

1384
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,160
Oh my god, no!

1385
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:17,920
Oh, my farm!

1386
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:20,260
Okay.

1387
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:21,820
That's fine.

1388
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,500
It's fine.

1389
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,220
We can...

1390
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:25,060
We can rebuild.

1391
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:27,780
It's fine.

1392
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:28,720
We'll just...

1393
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,460
We'll have our people starve a little bit.

1394
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:31,220
And it'll be okay.

1395
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:34,080
It'll be okay, you know?

1396
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:37,980
A little bit of hunger doesn't hurt anybody.

1397
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,280
We gotta...

1398
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,780
Starve a little for...

1399
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:43,740
Starve a little bit for...

1400
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:45,740
For the city.

1401
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:46,560
For the kingdom.

1402
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:48,200
That's okay.

1403
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,440
Sometimes you have to starve a little.

1404
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,200
I wanna...

1405
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,240
Do this dungeon.

1406
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,660
Actually, we should attack this first.

1407
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,660
For the greater good.

1408
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:01,440
For the city.

1409
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,540
Do you not care about the city?

1410
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,020
That's the tax collector.

1411
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,100
That's right.

1412
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,400
Collect the taxes.

1413
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:10,140
That's right.

1414
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:13,340
Alright, we should rename everybody.

1415
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:13,820
Alright.

1416
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:15,200
Alright.

1417
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:16,060
Disco.

1418
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:17,860
Lily.

1419
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:19,680
Annabelle.

1420
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:20,020
Alright.

1421
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:20,940
Afro.

1422
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:22,940
I'm naming people randomly in chat.

1423
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:24,340
Grass.

1424
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,240
Oh, wait.

1425
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:27,980
This should be me.

1426
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:31,180
Jokey.

1427
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,460
I'm the tax man.

1428
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:37,920
That's right.

1429
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:41,860
The builders can just be dragoon.

1430
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,200
Dragoon too.

1431
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:44,040
Oh, wait.

1432
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:44,800
I can't...

1433
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,760
Dragoons.

1434
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,200
Dragoon.

1435
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:52,800
Dragoon.

1436
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:53,320
Alright.

1437
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,120
They're just all...

1438
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,120
I'm the tax man.

1439
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,740
Of course I'm the tax man.

1440
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:01,520
Oh, now...

1441
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,520
Oh, the more...

1442
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:02,960
It is.

1443
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,160
Basically, the more...

1444
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,600
The more I'm expanding, the more I get...

1445
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:08,300
Oh, nice.

1446
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:09,600
Goal destroy.

1447
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:10,500
Foul item.

1448
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:11,100
Alright.

1449
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:13,540
Good for them.

1450
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:15,640
Uh...

1451
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,180
What else should I build?

1452
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:17,900
I don't...

1453
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:18,940
I'll just build more inn.

1454
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:20,800
A place for...

1455
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,240
A place for...

1456
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:21,360
A place for...

1457
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:21,640
A place for...

1458
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:22,160
A place for...

1459
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,660
A place for...

1460
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:33,360
That's...

1461
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,660
I'll let him...

1462
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:37,560
Uh...

1463
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,940
How do I do the dungeon again?

1464
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:44,900
Depths...

1465
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:45,660
Available...

1466
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:46,560
Expectation...

1467
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,760
Expedition...

1468
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:48,380
Expeditions?

1469
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,000
How do I...

1470
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,180
Do the dungeons again?

1471
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:52,900
I know they taught me.

1472
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,520
I know they like...

1473
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,260
I know they like...

1474
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:01,780
Teach me.

1475
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,020
But like...

1476
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:03,840
Oh, explore quest.

1477
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:04,660
Oh, is this?

1478
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:05,760
Oh.

1479
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:06,760
Okay.

1480
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,540
Put us here, just in case.

1481
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,060
My farmhouse.

1482
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:12,280
We don't need fences.

1483
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:13,280
It's fine.

1484
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:14,860
Wait.

1485
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,260
Someone heal this guy.

1486
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:17,660
Dad, get over here.

1487
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:19,160
Dad, my drag wounds need help.

1488
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,080
Dad, my drag wounds need help.

1489
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,300
Dad's like...

1490
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:22,820
Yippee.

1491
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,580
Look at the goblins.

1492
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:27,360
Oh.

1493
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:29,460
Look at this goblin house.

1494
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:34,920
This town is so...

1495
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:35,980
You live in it.

1496
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,680
You can move out whenever you want.

1497
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:39,640
But you know this is all you have.

1498
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:47,960
You can move out whenever you want.

1499
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,600
But yet you still live in my depressing home.

1500
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:58,120
So you mean we can't...

1501
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,600
You can move whenever you want.

1502
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:06,520
If he moves, we get less taxes.

1503
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,980
How the fuck do I build these...

1504
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:10,340
Okay.

1505
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:11,240
That's fine.

1506
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,720
We don't need fences where I come from.

1507
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:18,280
I believe in the Doki town.

1508
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:19,600
Alright.

1509
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:20,600
Let's see.

1510
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:22,620
Push door.

1511
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:23,500
Go.

1512
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:24,920
Go to the dungeon.

1513
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:26,320
There's nothing else to do here.

1514
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:29,540
I am not...

1515
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:30,020
I mean...

1516
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:31,580
Destroy the monstrous idol.

1517
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,660
Where the fuck is that monstrous...

1518
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:35,160
You know I'm building more cow ladies.

1519
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:36,040
Fuck it.

1520
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:42,740
Let's just build more cow ladies.

1521
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:44,780
We need more.

1522
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:47,560
The people demand more cow women.

1523
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:52,860
And like, you know, if we're starving, we can just eat the cows.

1524
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:57,820
They're practically the same thing as regular cows, if you think about it.

1525
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,860
Wait, there's only one guy exploring it.

1526
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:02,300
Is she okay?

1527
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,480
Oh, she did it.

1528
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:07,160
Nice.

1529
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:08,680
On to greener pastures.

1530
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:10,880
Let's get moving.

1531
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:11,880
Alright.

1532
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,440
Van-ta...

1533
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,000
Van-na-ta...

1534
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:16,820
Van-na...

1535
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:17,640
Van-na-ski.

1536
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:18,480
Okay, there you go.

1537
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:19,740
That's your name now.

1538
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:20,640
Wait, did I not...

1539
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,140
Oh, I forgot to...

1540
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:23,200
Van...

1541
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,620
Oh, you have to...

1542
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:25,860
Press enter.

1543
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,440
Are they still Dragoon?

1544
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:28,560
They are still Dragoon.

1545
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,640
That's all I care about.

1546
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:31,380
Alright, Lucy.

1547
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,280
You're Allen now.

1548
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:36,500
Wait, is that still depressed?

1549
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:37,740
Oh, there you go.

1550
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:38,880
He's euphoric now.

1551
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:39,980
But why?

1552
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,160
What's making him so happy?

1553
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:43,980
I made friends with...

1554
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:46,360
I made a friend with Dragoon!

1555
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:47,580
Oh my god!

1556
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:49,200
I had a beer!

1557
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,040
I...

1558
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,480
That's why he's happy.

1559
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:54,980
He's like, yippee!

1560
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:56,420
I got beer!

1561
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,140
Yay!

1562
00:50:58,680 --> 00:50:59,720
Oh, shit!

1563
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:01,720
Um...

1564
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:02,940
Where are they coming from?

1565
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:04,760
Oh my god!

1566
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:05,000
No!

1567
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:05,640
My farm!

1568
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,000
My farm!

1569
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:10,360
Okay, it's fine.

1570
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:10,760
It's fine.

1571
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:11,420
They're coming over.

1572
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:12,960
It's fine.

1573
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:13,820
We can rebuild.

1574
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:14,500
As always.

1575
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,020
We can always rebuild.

1576
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:18,600
They're only coming from the right.

1577
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:18,960
Yeah?

1578
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:19,900
Oh, they are.

1579
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:20,620
Guys!

1580
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:21,680
Oh my god!

1581
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:22,060
No!

1582
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:26,100
Not my farm!

1583
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:27,780
Oh, hey!

1584
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:29,360
Let's send people in here.

1585
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,620
Let's get Max Mofo.

1586
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:33,660
Let's get these guys.

1587
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,160
Okay, maybe they should...

1588
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:35,380
Alright.

1589
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:39,100
Retrieve the Wand of Amorak.

1590
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:40,600
It's fine.

1591
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:41,520
We'll have...

1592
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,220
Oh my god!

1593
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:43,020
It's not fine.

1594
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:44,440
It is not fine.

1595
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,100
Guys, defend!

1596
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:45,800
Guys!

1597
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,300
My Fountain of Healing!

1598
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:50,380
Oh my god!

1599
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:50,660
Please!

1600
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:51,480
Okay.

1601
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:53,440
Rebuild.

1602
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:54,920
We'll rebuild this.

1603
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:56,120
We can always rebuild.

1604
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:57,100
Please.

1605
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:57,860
We literally...

1606
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:58,820
There's only one way.

1607
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:01,780
It's okay.

1608
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:03,220
A little bit of...

1609
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:06,120
Wait, there's a dungeon in the middle of my town?

1610
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,780
Why is there...

1611
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:08,020
Okay.

1612
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:11,440
Why is there a dungeon in the middle of my town?

1613
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:14,260
Like, where did that spawn from?

1614
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:16,860
Alright.

1615
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:17,660
Go in there.

1616
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,740
Go and get that Wand of whatever.

1617
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:21,600
Okay.

1618
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:22,600
We rebuild that.

1619
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:25,540
We can't have our farm back though, unfortunately.

1620
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:27,840
Who...

1621
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:28,840
Who fucking...

1622
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:31,280
Why are my farms being made in the...

1623
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,700
Edges of the border?

1624
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:33,740
Like...

1625
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,380
Why are they there?

1626
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:41,120
Like...

1627
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:41,640
I don't know.

1628
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:41,900
Okay.

1629
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,520
Maybe we'll have more goblins.

1630
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:44,180
Maybe.

1631
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:45,960
I'll have another goblin.

1632
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,420
It doesn't hurt to have more goblins.

1633
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:52,730
It doesn't hurt.

1634
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:54,870
There's more goblins.

1635
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:56,230
For the kingdom.

1636
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:57,310
Oh, nice!

1637
00:52:57,750 --> 00:52:59,130
What perk do I have now?

1638
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,400
Mana Explode on...

1639
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,200
Yeah, fuck it.

1640
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:10,680
At least like their deaths...

1641
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:11,420
At least their...

1642
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:12,380
It means something.

1643
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,480
Do you think they'll be fine?

1644
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,340
It is says level 22.

1645
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:18,740
It should be fine.

1646
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:21,100
Yay!

1647
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:21,820
More goblins!

1648
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:23,560
More goblins!

1649
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:26,840
Wait.

1650
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:27,600
What's that?

1651
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:28,440
Oh my god.

1652
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:29,420
There's this one guy.

1653
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:30,960
Someone get this one guy out of here.

1654
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:34,620
They'll be fine.

1655
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:36,200
I believe in them.

1656
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,040
Alright.

1657
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:42,520
Well, I'm gonna wait until these guys are done with this dungeon.

1658
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,460
Because they're like my strongest.

1659
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,340
So I'm gonna wait for them to be done.

1660
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:47,920
So...

1661
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:49,540
Uh...

1662
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:51,380
Destroy a monstrous idol.

1663
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:54,800
Was that the monstrous idol that I did?

1664
00:53:58,980 --> 00:53:59,460
Oh yeah.

1665
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:00,180
See, they're okay.

1666
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:00,860
Oh my god.

1667
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,620
There's like a story down there.

1668
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:04,240
The manticore wars.

1669
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:05,640
The party attacks.

1670
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:08,140
Stealing 99 damage to the manticore.

1671
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:11,300
They're having their own little fucking adventure right now.

1672
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:12,260
Uh...

1673
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:16,560
It's fine.

1674
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,820
We'll just let these guys have a good time.

1675
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:19,080
Wait.

1676
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:19,940
Where's my...

1677
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:20,840
I should heal her.

1678
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:21,960
She should be fine.

1679
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:22,980
I believe in Disco.

1680
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,300
This is our first time fighting.

1681
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,080
You go, Disco.

1682
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:28,580
That's right, Disco.

1683
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:29,180
You go.

1684
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:30,260
You go, girl.

1685
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,420
Okay, there's the farm.

1686
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:34,640
I don't know what else to build.

1687
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:35,460
Oh my god.

1688
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:37,040
Are you fucking kidding me?

1689
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:37,800
Where?

1690
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:40,080
Where?

1691
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:42,880
Oh my god.

1692
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:43,860
They're all the way...

1693
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:44,620
Wait.

1694
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:46,100
It's just one guy.

1695
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:47,860
I mean, I could defend it.

1696
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:50,360
Oh my god.

1697
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:50,600
No.

1698
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:51,840
They're coming from the sewers.

1699
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:53,320
They're coming from the sewers.

1700
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:55,200
Okay.

1701
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,060
I didn't realize they were actually...

1702
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:57,900
coming from the sewers.

1703
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:00,120
Are they still...

1704
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:01,380
Are they not done yet?

1705
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:03,940
Okay.

1706
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:05,380
There's still a lot of monsters.

1707
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:06,580
He was bait.

1708
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:08,680
They was bait all along.

1709
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:09,680
They were...

1710
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,120
They were in the sewers.

1711
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:13,720
Okay.

1712
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:14,640
I'll put...

1713
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:15,280
Oh my god.

1714
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:15,560
Please.

1715
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:18,920
Please get them.

1716
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:19,460
Please.

1717
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:20,060
Not the crops.

1718
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,140
We can't have another famine, guys.

1719
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:24,760
We can't have another famine.

1720
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:25,280
Please.

1721
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:26,060
Please.

1722
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,720
I just...

1723
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:31,240
I just...

1724
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,100
My best people are in this dungeon.

1725
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:34,500
And they're still there.

1726
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:38,700
Wait.

1727
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:38,980
What?

1728
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:40,300
Oh no.

1729
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:41,540
What broke?

1730
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:43,380
Oh no.

1731
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:44,060
I should have...

1732
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:45,460
Where are my people?

1733
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:47,220
Where are they?

1734
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:48,220
Where are they?

1735
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:48,820
Why are they?

1736
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:49,900
Excuse me.

1737
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:51,360
Excuse me.

1738
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:53,360
Where are you guys not...

1739
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:54,900
There's a rat here?

1740
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:56,240
Excuse...

1741
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,220
Please.

1742
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:58,440
Stop.

1743
00:55:58,880 --> 00:55:59,780
Are you going to the...

1744
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:00,700
I swear...

1745
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:01,360
Oh my god.

1746
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:01,940
He's like...

1747
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:02,700
I'm too depressed.

1748
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:04,360
I...

1749
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:08,780
He's...

1750
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:09,560
Please.

1751
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,860
Someone killed Cheddar.

1752
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,660
Our fucking farm.

1753
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:20,870
Oh my thing.

1754
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:23,430
Where are my...

1755
00:56:23,430 --> 00:56:23,770
Okay.

1756
00:56:23,930 --> 00:56:24,810
We're getting...

1757
00:56:24,810 --> 00:56:26,130
We're gonna...

1758
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:27,170
Oh my god.

1759
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:29,110
It's because they're patrolling this.

1760
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:30,690
Get out of here.

1761
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:31,650
Get...

1762
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:32,830
Get out.

1763
00:56:33,050 --> 00:56:34,450
Get out of here.

1764
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:35,890
You got your money.

1765
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:36,730
Go...

1766
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:37,750
They're like...

1767
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:40,910
Why kill when I can get free money over here?

1768
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:42,470
Oh my god.

1769
00:56:42,810 --> 00:56:43,270
Please.

1770
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:44,750
Someone kill Cheddar.

1771
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:46,130
Someone please.

1772
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:49,450
He's just nomming on the cowhouse.

1773
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:52,830
I did.

1774
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:55,510
I did put a bounty.

1775
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:57,090
But no one cares.

1776
00:56:57,770 --> 00:56:59,310
Someone please.

1777
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:04,890
The fact that they were...

1778
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:05,570
Oh my god.

1779
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:07,750
They were literally staying there for the free money.

1780
00:57:07,910 --> 00:57:08,190
They're like...

1781
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:08,570
Why?

1782
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:12,850
Why work so hard when I can get free money right here?

1783
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:15,010
That's so fucked up.

1784
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:20,690
Defending is just easier.

1785
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:21,390
Alright.

1786
00:57:21,490 --> 00:57:22,430
Into the dungeon.

1787
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:24,850
Alright.

1788
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:26,030
Get in there.

1789
00:57:27,790 --> 00:57:28,670
Get in...

1790
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:30,310
No one's like to be a man.

1791
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:31,170
You're dealing.

1792
00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:32,730
The fact that...

1793
00:57:32,730 --> 00:57:33,590
Oh my god.

1794
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:34,470
Assembling.

1795
00:57:34,610 --> 00:57:36,170
There's another raid?

1796
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:38,210
Where did they assemble?

1797
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:39,070
Where?

1798
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:42,310
Where are they assembling?

1799
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:46,170
Oh my god.

1800
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:47,170
What is that?

1801
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:49,970
Reward's too small.

1802
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:53,010
Oh my god.

1803
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:55,690
The reward is too small.

1804
00:57:56,670 --> 00:57:58,710
You're level four.

1805
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:04,750
Disco is level 11.

1806
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:06,770
And he's willing to do this.

1807
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:07,930
Oh my god.

1808
00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:10,190
I can't believe I have to micromanage this.

1809
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:12,870
I can't believe it.

1810
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:14,470
Oh my...

1811
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:16,410
Reward too fucking small.

1812
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:17,770
You fuckers.

1813
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:18,630
You...

1814
00:58:20,550 --> 00:58:22,810
You live in my town.

1815
00:58:23,090 --> 00:58:23,530
And...

1816
00:58:24,530 --> 00:58:28,730
And have the audacity to save reward too small.

1817
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:30,850
Alright.

1818
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:32,790
Burn your...

1819
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:34,430
I'm just gonna start looking at them.

1820
00:58:34,430 --> 00:58:34,850
If...

1821
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:35,850
I swear to god.

1822
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:36,450
I'm just...

1823
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:38,170
I'm just gonna start looking at them.

1824
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:41,190
I'm almost like...

1825
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:43,670
Disco doesn't know her price yet.

1826
00:58:44,010 --> 00:58:44,490
It's fine.

1827
00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:45,510
I'll do it myself.

1828
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:47,130
I'll just look at them.

1829
00:58:50,170 --> 00:58:51,370
Power too though.

1830
00:58:51,470 --> 00:58:51,930
That's right.

1831
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:52,470
Leave.

1832
00:58:53,010 --> 00:58:53,390
Leave.

1833
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:55,750
I'll do it myself.

1834
00:58:58,810 --> 00:58:59,970
I'm fucking...

1835
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:01,230
Reward too small.

1836
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:02,330
I...

1837
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:03,070
Oh my god.

1838
00:59:03,070 --> 00:59:03,770
That's...

1839
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:06,210
That's right.

1840
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:06,710
Leave.

1841
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:07,770
Leave.

1842
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:13,180
It's so...

1843
00:59:13,610 --> 00:59:14,930
If it...

1844
00:59:14,930 --> 00:59:15,310
Leave.

1845
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:17,990
Get out of here.

1846
00:59:18,970 --> 00:59:20,670
Get out of my city.

1847
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:25,390
That's right.

1848
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:28,310
I'll just watch them while I figure this out.

1849
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:29,970
Uh...

1850
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:31,170
Do I need another...

1851
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:32,610
Passively generating...

1852
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:33,310
Gold generation.

1853
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:34,510
A few tents claiming.

1854
00:59:34,930 --> 00:59:36,710
I feel like I can build another market.

1855
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:41,720
Okay.

1856
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:42,640
I'll build another one.

1857
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:45,400
I mean...

1858
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:46,140
More gold, right?

1859
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:48,820
As long as I get more gold.

1860
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:49,800
That's all that matters.

1861
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,260
Oh my god.

1862
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:53,160
I swear to god.

1863
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:57,920
Oh my god.

1864
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:58,880
Where are they coming from?

1865
00:59:59,020 --> 00:59:59,140
Okay.

1866
00:59:59,200 --> 00:59:59,520
Right here.

1867
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:01,520
Oh my god.

1868
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,140
That's a lot.

1869
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:03,540
Oh my god.

1870
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:04,640
Okay.

1871
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:04,960
It's fine.

1872
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:05,720
I'm looking at them.

1873
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:06,580
It's fine.

1874
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:07,800
And then I've got wolves too.

1875
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:09,320
I've got the wolves in here.

1876
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:10,860
That's right.

1877
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:13,200
I've got the wolves.

1878
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:14,420
The wolves will be here.

1879
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:15,920
I swear to god.

1880
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,920
If they feel like this job...

1881
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:18,920
Where is my...

1882
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:19,820
The rest of them?

1883
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:23,540
Reward too small.

1884
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:24,800
I'm getting attacked.

1885
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:26,020
This is your home.

1886
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,580
This is literally your home.

1887
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:31,300
There's no such thing as reward too small.

1888
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:33,320
This is where you live.

1889
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:39,200
Oh my god.

1890
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:40,660
Oh my god.

1891
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:41,760
I'm rebuilding.

1892
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,000
Oh my...

1893
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:45,300
That's right.

1894
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:46,620
You fucking deserve this.

1895
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:48,060
Oh my god.

1896
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:49,880
You all deserve this.

1897
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:51,740
I can't reward...

1898
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:52,820
Where are...

1899
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:54,220
Are they all eating?

1900
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:55,480
Where...

1901
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:56,560
Where are they?

1902
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:57,560
Where...

1903
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:01,060
Where are my people?

1904
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:03,200
Oh wow.

1905
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:07,140
Now that I put $300 down the line...

1906
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:08,840
Down the line.

1907
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:09,540
They're like...

1908
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:09,800
Alright.

1909
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:10,180
Sure.

1910
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:11,080
I'll come over.

1911
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,480
He's too cheap.

1912
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:14,920
He's too cheap.

1913
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:16,380
Alright.

1914
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,000
Okay.

1915
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:18,600
We need this.

1916
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:20,040
We need the burning thing.

1917
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:22,760
Alright.

1918
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:24,000
What did I earn?

1919
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,740
The rat king has been slain.

1920
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,140
Thank fucking god.

1921
01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:35,290
We'll grab that.

1922
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:36,790
Thank god.

1923
01:01:38,190 --> 01:01:40,210
It's stupid team.

1924
01:01:40,710 --> 01:01:41,090
Mine.

1925
01:01:43,590 --> 01:01:45,830
I should have hired the spearmen.

1926
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:48,110
I feel like the spearmen...

1927
01:01:48,810 --> 01:01:52,050
The spearmen will actually do their jobs.

1928
01:01:52,330 --> 01:01:54,790
Instead of the shit that they're putting me through right now.

1929
01:01:55,890 --> 01:01:56,690
Alright.

1930
01:01:59,190 --> 01:02:00,930
Let's pick one of the...

1931
01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:01,110
Okay.

1932
01:02:01,450 --> 01:02:02,590
Improve all farms.

1933
01:02:04,130 --> 01:02:04,930
Alright.

1934
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:07,550
Both the mayor and the arrow.

1935
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:07,890
Oh!

1936
01:02:08,070 --> 01:02:09,090
I'm greedy!

1937
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:12,670
I literally built this place for you to live in.

1938
01:02:12,790 --> 01:02:13,690
But oh...

1939
01:02:13,690 --> 01:02:15,790
I'm the greedy one.

1940
01:02:16,050 --> 01:02:18,310
The rats began to swarm.

1941
01:02:18,710 --> 01:02:20,730
Search the sewers for...

1942
01:02:20,730 --> 01:02:21,570
Are you...

1943
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:22,130
Where...

1944
01:02:22,130 --> 01:02:23,430
What rats?

1945
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:24,410
What?

1946
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:27,590
Okay.

1947
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:29,770
Let's get people in here.

1948
01:02:31,890 --> 01:02:32,450
Okay.

1949
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:33,290
We're not...

1950
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:33,630
Alright.

1951
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:34,270
There we go.

1952
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:35,950
We'll get our best men in here.

1953
01:02:36,410 --> 01:02:37,390
I'm just like...

1954
01:02:37,390 --> 01:02:40,250
What do you mean the rats began to swarm?

1955
01:02:40,450 --> 01:02:40,990
Oh!

1956
01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:41,710
Too small!

1957
01:02:41,930 --> 01:02:42,730
Oh my god.

1958
01:02:44,530 --> 01:02:45,650
How about...

1959
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:50,240
Yeah.

1960
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:52,400
There we go.

1961
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:54,940
At least Octavia knows what's good for her.

1962
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:55,840
Alright.

1963
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:56,980
Thank god.

1964
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,300
She knows her worth.

1965
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:01,520
They're in the walls.

1966
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:02,540
That's it.

1967
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:04,420
Get this quest out of here.

1968
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,180
Get this quest out of here.

1969
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:07,140
Fucking...

1970
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:08,040
Leeches.

1971
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:13,100
It's all about money for them.

1972
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,440
Money, money, money.

1973
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:18,800
What about the future of our town?

1974
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:23,440
We all have to make sacrifices for our city.

1975
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,980
I don't understand.

1976
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:29,240
Oh my god.

1977
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:30,560
Not this guy.

1978
01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:31,780
Not our farm.

1979
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:33,700
Alright, Buttercup.

1980
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:35,280
At least you...

1981
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:36,220
Oh my god.

1982
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:36,920
No!

1983
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:38,080
Oh fuck!

1984
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:40,420
Oh my god.

1985
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:41,200
I didn't even realize.

1986
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:42,360
Why...

1987
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,220
Why do they just want to...

1988
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:45,520
Okay, we'll put 200 in here.

1989
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:46,640
Oh my god.

1990
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:47,360
Not the market.

1991
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:48,220
Oh my god.

1992
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:49,240
They're all just here.

1993
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:50,500
They're all...

1994
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:51,640
Rats.

1995
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:52,460
Rats.

1996
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:52,820
What's up?

1997
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:53,880
Grosses.

1998
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:55,000
Thank you for the...

1999
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,280
Super chat.

2000
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:56,720
Thank you.

2001
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:57,560
Thank you.

2002
01:03:58,940 --> 01:03:59,500
Alright.

2003
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:00,420
That's fine.

2004
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:01,220
That's fine.

2005
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:02,060
I have woes.

2006
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:02,740
If anything...

2007
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:03,760
I have woes.

2008
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:05,480
If anything...

2009
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:06,840
We have woes.

2010
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:10,320
Okay.

2011
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:12,060
Uh...

2012
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:13,100
I feel like...

2013
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:14,560
Okay, we gotta build another fountain.

2014
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:15,240
For sure.

2015
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:16,860
I'll build one here.

2016
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:19,980
And then I'll build another fountain.

2017
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:22,640
Wait, where's this fountain?

2018
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:24,340
I'll build another fountain here.

2019
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:25,120
Just in case.

2020
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,980
So then my people can be healed.

2021
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:29,720
It's okay.

2022
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:30,940
The tax man is coming.

2023
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:32,440
Don't worry.

2024
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:33,800
Everyone.

2025
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,660
The tax man is here.

2026
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:38,820
That's right.

2027
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:41,720
That's right.

2028
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:43,020
Tax them all.

2029
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:44,380
Oh my god.

2030
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:45,400
I'll look at Wally.

2031
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:46,980
I'll watch him slowly die.

2032
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:50,440
I don't have to waste money on people.

2033
01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:53,600
Okay.

2034
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:55,020
Explore this dungeon.

2035
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:57,660
Put 200 in there.

2036
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:58,640
Surely...

2037
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,700
Surely people would be...

2038
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:00,980
Okay.

2039
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:01,640
300.

2040
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:04,500
Would $300 suffice, guys?

2041
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:06,620
Would $300...

2042
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:07,070
Not...

2043
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:11,360
Would $300 make you happy?

2044
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,560
Excuse me?

2045
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,080
Too small?

2046
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:17,200
You were just born.

2047
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:17,880
Okay.

2048
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:18,660
400.

2049
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:20,840
500?

2050
01:05:25,410 --> 01:05:25,880
550.

2051
01:05:28,530 --> 01:05:29,000
Oh.

2052
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:29,780
Dad.

2053
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:30,600
Okay.

2054
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:31,340
Oh.

2055
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:35,680
Of course.

2056
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:36,780
Of course.

2057
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:37,620
Dad.

2058
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:38,920
It's like...

2059
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:39,300
Yippee!

2060
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:40,920
Yippee!

2061
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:43,600
Of fucking course.

2062
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,260
You want that money.

2063
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:47,060
Of course you do.

2064
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,440
Now we're talking.

2065
01:05:54,540 --> 01:05:55,380
Yeah, sure.

2066
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:56,480
I don't know what he does.

2067
01:05:56,780 --> 01:05:57,920
What is he even doing?

2068
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,620
Oh, is he in the dungeon yet?

2069
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:01,960
Alright.

2070
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:02,780
Get in there.

2071
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:05,020
Is that the only one that would be like...

2072
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:05,560
Yeah, sure.

2073
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:06,380
Yeah.

2074
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:11,360
What is your...

2075
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:11,980
What is your...

2076
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:13,320
Enlisting...

2077
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:15,900
Recovering happiness and then buy a beer.

2078
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:19,100
All right.

2079
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,340
Can you go in the dungeon?

2080
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:22,000
Wait, that's it!

2081
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:25,380
You fucker.

2082
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:27,120
You took 500...

2083
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:28,180
You...

2084
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:29,760
You fucking...

2085
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,340
Oh, I should have got the rock.

2086
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:33,360
I should have fucking...

2087
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:35,180
I should have got the...

2088
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:38,480
Go pay your goddamn fucking taxes.

2089
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:39,480
Go...

2090
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:45,040
I wanted you to explore in a dungeon.

2091
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:46,640
What are you...

2092
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:48,500
Oh, my God.

2093
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:51,680
Your dad is a genius.

2094
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:52,840
He's like...

2095
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,860
Oh, I got my 550.

2096
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:56,980
Guess I'll go...

2097
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:58,820
I'll go buy a beer now.

2098
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:01,240
I don't...

2099
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:02,180
That...

2100
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:03,420
That's not a call.

2101
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,700
I can't believe he...

2102
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:06,840
Oh, my God.

2103
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,120
I can't believe he did that.

2104
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,080
He literally just went there...

2105
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:14,460
For, like, 550 and just left...

2106
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:15,960
The actual fucker.

2107
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:17,640
Wait, there's, like, people here.

2108
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:20,780
I'm, like, literally looking into something.

2109
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:24,040
Where is this monster?

2110
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:25,940
Next wave power...

2111
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:26,600
Is it here?

2112
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:27,980
Oh, there he is.

2113
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:28,380
Okay.

2114
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,340
I'll do this.

2115
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:35,840
Okay, I feel like...

2116
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:37,120
Maybe...

2117
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:37,800
I'll do 600.

2118
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:39,480
70.

2119
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:41,900
700.

2120
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:46,900
How is only Lucy okay with this quest?

2121
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:48,920
Already taken.

2122
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:50,160
Already taken.

2123
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,080
Not for a god beast.

2124
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,380
What do you mean already taken?

2125
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:55,880
Oh, my God.

2126
01:07:56,060 --> 01:07:56,280
Please.

2127
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:57,480
Okay, it's fine.

2128
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:01,100
We'll defend our land here.

2129
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:04,580
And then...

2130
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:05,040
Okay, good.

2131
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:06,480
All right, good.

2132
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:08,440
Oh, now you're willing to take $100.

2133
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:10,360
But not any of this.

2134
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:11,280
Okay, that's fine.

2135
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:12,280
That's okay.

2136
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:13,040
That's okay.

2137
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:14,000
That's okay.

2138
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,460
The rats began to swarm.

2139
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:17,400
Again?

2140
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:18,440
Again?

2141
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:19,260
How...

2142
01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:21,020
Oh, my God.

2143
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:22,540
How many...

2144
01:08:22,540 --> 01:08:24,760
Again, how many do they need?

2145
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:26,540
Please, someone.

2146
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:27,680
Please kill these guys.

2147
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:28,300
Please.

2148
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:30,700
Please.

2149
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:32,320
Somebody killed him.

2150
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:34,940
Rats.

2151
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:35,660
Rats.

2152
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,020
We're the rats.

2153
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:39,060
Wait, did I...

2154
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:39,900
Made it one?

2155
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:41,500
I mean, he's still alive.

2156
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:43,700
Wait, did he just left?

2157
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:48,950
All right.

2158
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:53,040
All right, guys.

2159
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:53,620
Come on.

2160
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,960
Surely, let's not leave it up for just the...

2161
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:58,120
Come on, guys.

2162
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:00,740
Let's not leave it up just for two goblins, guys.

2163
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:06,660
Guys, I feel like if it was just two goblins, we might be fucked.

2164
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:09,100
What if I just send the wolves in here?

2165
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:10,280
Oh.

2166
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:17,860
I just accidentally sent more things to fight this.

2167
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:18,600
I...

2168
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:22,580
Never mind.

2169
01:09:22,780 --> 01:09:25,060
I think the wolves was a bad idea.

2170
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:26,020
Maybe.

2171
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:31,180
The wolves may or may not have been a bad idea.

2172
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:35,760
All right.

2173
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:38,120
Let's get rid of him.

2174
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:38,960
I'll just look at him.

2175
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:39,420
I'll help.

2176
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:40,180
I'll help.

2177
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:40,780
Don't worry.

2178
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:42,480
Oh, wait.

2179
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:43,060
This...

2180
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:44,440
This guy does nothing.

2181
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:45,960
Oh!

2182
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:46,920
Okay, he's fine.

2183
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:48,160
It does nothing.

2184
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,500
It's literally just like...

2185
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:50,980
It's...

2186
01:09:50,980 --> 01:09:53,080
Remember that wolf I accidentally...

2187
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:54,980
I paid money for?

2188
01:09:56,620 --> 01:09:57,140
Uh...

2189
01:09:58,220 --> 01:09:58,740
Whoops.

2190
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:02,280
I should not have paid money for that wolf.

2191
01:10:03,780 --> 01:10:04,480
All right, yeah.

2192
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:05,900
He's just standing there.

2193
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:07,160
Yeah, I thought he'd do more.

2194
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:10,800
Look at that.

2195
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:13,920
Oh, that's so many perks.

2196
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:15,640
I got rangers, though.

2197
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:18,920
Let's get rangers.

2198
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,840
Let's just add more people into our town.

2199
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:22,520
You know what?

2200
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:25,520
Go explore that dungeon.

2201
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:28,820
Let's put all...

2202
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:30,260
Let's put our best people in here.

2203
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:32,840
Oh, wait.

2204
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:34,000
Attack that.

2205
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:35,840
More.

2206
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:38,020
Oh, my God.

2207
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:39,240
Oh, my God.

2208
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:40,140
I was not expecting...

2209
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:40,260
Wait.

2210
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:41,400
Where is the wave coming from?

2211
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:43,120
Guys?

2212
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:43,680
Guys.

2213
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:45,780
Guys.

2214
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:46,120
Okay.

2215
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:47,020
I was gonna say...

2216
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:47,140
Guys.

2217
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:47,580
There you are.

2218
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:48,140
Like a...

2219
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:49,380
Oh, there is a lot.

2220
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:50,400
Oh, what is that?

2221
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:51,880
There is a prison, too?

2222
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:53,280
Oh, it's fine.

2223
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:54,120
I'm looking at them.

2224
01:10:54,220 --> 01:10:54,720
I'm helping.

2225
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:55,980
I'm looking.

2226
01:10:56,620 --> 01:10:57,340
I'm looking.

2227
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:02,200
I'm looking.

2228
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:03,340
By looking.

2229
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:04,900
Don't worry, people.

2230
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:05,880
Wait.

2231
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:07,080
But who's gonna...

2232
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:07,500
Okay.

2233
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:07,860
Don't worry.

2234
01:11:07,940 --> 01:11:08,720
They're defending here.

2235
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:09,400
Don't worry.

2236
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:10,700
I'm helping my team.

2237
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:13,360
I volunteer as...

2238
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:15,280
Look harder.

2239
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:17,740
I'm looking as hard as I can.

2240
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:21,500
Wait.

2241
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:22,300
Did someone die?

2242
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:23,960
Wasn't there four of them?

2243
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:26,280
Wait.

2244
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:27,520
Does no one want to take this?

2245
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:30,380
Okay.

2246
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:32,340
What if I put another $100 in here?

2247
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:33,580
And $150.

2248
01:11:34,260 --> 01:11:34,980
$400?

2249
01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:35,860
That's fine.

2250
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:37,240
$400 should be enough.

2251
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:39,240
Alright.

2252
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:41,540
Good job, Doki.

2253
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:42,960
Good job.

2254
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,560
You looked at them.

2255
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:45,660
See, guys?

2256
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:46,920
I looked.

2257
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:48,700
The ranger.

2258
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:50,000
And then...

2259
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,500
We'll add another...

2260
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:55,020
We'll add another ranger here.

2261
01:11:55,820 --> 01:11:57,400
I have one more here, too.

2262
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:00,140
And then...

2263
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:03,040
Doki throwing money at the problem.

2264
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:05,300
Don't worry.

2265
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:06,120
I believe.

2266
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:07,360
Come on, guys.

2267
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:08,200
Wait.

2268
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:09,340
Can you guys not attack this?

2269
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:10,420
Are you guys scared?

2270
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:11,560
What are you guys scared about?

2271
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:12,980
Come on.

2272
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:15,320
See...

2273
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:16,920
I'll put another $100 in there.

2274
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:19,080
Why are you so scared?

2275
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:21,840
Just fight it.

2276
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:24,220
You're so...

2277
01:12:24,220 --> 01:12:25,160
You're so healthy.

2278
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:27,420
Yeah, that's right.

2279
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:27,820
Don't worry.

2280
01:12:27,940 --> 01:12:28,760
I'll look at it.

2281
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:29,520
Help out.

2282
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:31,920
What is over...

2283
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:32,460
There's like...

2284
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:32,940
Oh, shit.

2285
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:33,460
Okay, wait.

2286
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:35,080
I thought that was a destroyed thing.

2287
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:36,920
Yes.

2288
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:39,420
Money will solve all problems.

2289
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:42,620
Oh, wait.

2290
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:43,300
I got more perks.

2291
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:44,120
Let's go.

2292
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:47,100
Oh, that's a chance to hit twice.

2293
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:47,560
Collect.

2294
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:48,440
But your gold...

2295
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:50,260
Your units regenerate faster when you're looking.

2296
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:51,000
Oh, my God.

2297
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:52,300
I can regenerate them, too.

2298
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:53,220
Don't worry, guys.

2299
01:12:53,420 --> 01:12:54,300
I shall keep looking.

2300
01:12:56,720 --> 01:13:00,200
The health care is $600 at least.

2301
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:00,800
Look.

2302
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:01,740
You guys don't want...

2303
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:02,560
Oh, my God.

2304
01:13:02,660 --> 01:13:04,300
What the fuck is that?

2305
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:06,300
Hey, there's...

2306
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:07,020
There's...

2307
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:08,840
What is that over there?

2308
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:12,040
Was that the prison home that I destroyed?

2309
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:12,380
No.

2310
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:13,980
This was the prison home.

2311
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:15,280
Okay, let's just kill these guys.

2312
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:17,060
I don't know what they are, but...

2313
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:17,900
Just fuck them up.

2314
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:19,220
Yeah, that's a lot.

2315
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:19,720
Don't worry.

2316
01:13:20,140 --> 01:13:20,700
They'll be fine.

2317
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:21,900
I'll start looking.

2318
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:25,120
Look.

2319
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:26,060
Okay, I'll have a list.

2320
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:26,660
200.

2321
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:27,220
300.

2322
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:28,220
There we go.

2323
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:30,020
Oh, now it's attractive.

2324
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:33,260
Oh, now you guys liked it.

2325
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:33,880
Look at that.

2326
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:34,420
Wait.

2327
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:35,540
What happened to him?

2328
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:37,600
Who is she?

2329
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:41,340
Oh, my God.

2330
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:42,860
Who is she?

2331
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,100
Is that the ranger?

2332
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:51,720
Oh, it is.

2333
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:53,100
I was like, are she okay?

2334
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,300
I was like, what is that?

2335
01:13:56,780 --> 01:13:58,040
Is she okay?

2336
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:00,780
Holy fuck.

2337
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:06,680
I don't know, but she's pretty hot.

2338
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:08,780
Okay, let's see.

2339
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:10,420
How about that?

2340
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:10,740
300?

2341
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:12,040
400?

2342
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:13,440
500?

2343
01:14:14,180 --> 01:14:14,820
All right.

2344
01:14:15,260 --> 01:14:16,780
500 is what they want.

2345
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:17,820
All right.

2346
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:18,480
I believe in them.

2347
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:20,020
As long as I...

2348
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:22,000
Oh, she's like, I'm not taking that.

2349
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:26,280
She saw...

2350
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:28,040
They saw, like...

2351
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:30,060
They're just like, yeah, no.

2352
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:30,640
Yeah.

2353
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:33,680
They saw how many people there.

2354
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:35,260
Okay, how about 600?

2355
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:36,820
650.

2356
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:37,780
Yes.

2357
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:39,360
650.

2358
01:14:40,340 --> 01:14:40,980
Come on, guys.

2359
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:42,860
Look, I'm literally helping.

2360
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:44,740
I'm helping so much.

2361
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:47,020
How did you guys back out?

2362
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:48,580
There you go.

2363
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:49,180
There you go.

2364
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:49,580
Look.

2365
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:50,340
All right.

2366
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:52,560
Guys, come on.

2367
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:53,940
They're literally right there.

2368
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:55,500
They're literally...

2369
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:58,160
Look, you have an army of cow women.

2370
01:14:59,280 --> 01:14:59,960
Come on.

2371
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:00,380
Look at...

2372
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:00,640
Okay.

2373
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:01,180
All right.

2374
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:02,580
Oh, she's sinking.

2375
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:04,700
They're almost dead.

2376
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:08,160
By the time they get there, they're almost dead.

2377
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:12,800
We explored it and it's not worth it.

2378
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:13,400
Please.

2379
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:13,960
All right.

2380
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:14,880
What about...

2381
01:15:15,660 --> 01:15:16,300
750.

2382
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:19,040
7% attractiveness now.

2383
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:20,280
750.

2384
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:21,480
Okay.

2385
01:15:21,820 --> 01:15:22,460
850.

2386
01:15:22,820 --> 01:15:23,460
850.

2387
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:24,820
My final offer.

2388
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:26,060
Oh, my God.

2389
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:27,580
Oh, my God.

2390
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:27,860
Okay.

2391
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:28,560
Give me a sec.

2392
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:30,280
We gotta defend this real quick.

2393
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:32,460
Please.

2394
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:33,780
We gotta save the ranger.

2395
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:34,240
Oh, wait.

2396
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:34,540
Cool.

2397
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:34,760
Wait.

2398
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:36,420
We have the beast tamer too?

2399
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:37,240
Wait.

2400
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:37,780
How many?

2401
01:15:38,020 --> 01:15:38,300
Wait.

2402
01:15:38,460 --> 01:15:38,880
What?

2403
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:40,340
Okay.

2404
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:41,200
I know, like...

2405
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:42,720
There's, like, a lot of stuff going on.

2406
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:44,480
Goth unrelenting.

2407
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:45,920
Goth huntress.

2408
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:46,820
Wait.

2409
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,520
There's so much more here.

2410
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:49,980
Okay.

2411
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:50,240
Wait.

2412
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:51,020
Someone defend.

2413
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:51,360
All right.

2414
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:51,960
All the...

2415
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:53,820
They all came back for this.

2416
01:15:54,180 --> 01:15:54,720
They all...

2417
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:57,220
They're like, we're not fighting this.

2418
01:15:57,460 --> 01:15:58,160
But, like...

2419
01:15:58,160 --> 01:15:59,480
We'll deal with the others.

2420
01:15:59,480 --> 01:15:59,880
All right.

2421
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:00,180
Fine.

2422
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:02,420
I'll slowly watch them until they die.

2423
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:03,400
Wait.

2424
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:04,160
Unless...

2425
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:04,340
Okay.

2426
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:05,640
We gotta rebuild this, though.

2427
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:08,420
That's fine.

2428
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:09,460
Uh...

2429
01:16:09,460 --> 01:16:11,560
Let's build, like, an inn next to it, too.

2430
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:15,340
All right.

2431
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:16,620
We'll build an inn next to here.

2432
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:17,640
And a fountain?

2433
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:18,740
We have a fountain here?

2434
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:19,280
Oh, we do.

2435
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:20,040
That's fine.

2436
01:16:21,060 --> 01:16:23,240
Nobody wants to take this mission.

2437
01:16:23,420 --> 01:16:24,900
So, I'll do the mission myself.

2438
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:25,760
Oh.

2439
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:26,320
Oh.

2440
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:31,820
Why are y'all leaving?

2441
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:36,300
I gave so much money.

2442
01:16:36,580 --> 01:16:36,760
Okay.

2443
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:38,180
9.50.

2444
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:39,880
My final offer.

2445
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:44,620
That's my final offer.

2446
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:49,120
It's not even that bad.

2447
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:50,960
It's...

2448
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:52,420
Fine.

2449
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:54,220
I'll look at them myself.

2450
01:16:55,340 --> 01:16:56,100
Okay.

2451
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:56,980
1K.

2452
01:16:58,100 --> 01:16:58,900
1...

2453
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:02,260
Oh.

2454
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:06,300
Now you want to come over just because they're all slowly dying.

2455
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:07,040
Yeah.

2456
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:13,960
I don't know.

2457
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:15,540
This looks like a scam.

2458
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:17,320
How is this a scam?

2459
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,860
I'm literally giving them free money right now.

2460
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:22,800
I'm doing most of the work at this point.

2461
01:17:25,620 --> 01:17:26,540
Oh, my God.

2462
01:17:26,660 --> 01:17:29,020
I'm just doing most of the work at this point.

2463
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:30,500
I swear to God.

2464
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:35,540
They're all just like, is she done yet?

2465
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:38,920
Is she done yet so I can take my free money?

2466
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:40,620
Hey, you fuckers.

2467
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,000
Is she...

2468
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:47,880
Oh, yeah.

2469
01:17:48,180 --> 01:17:48,460
Yes.

2470
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:49,460
What did I get out of that?

2471
01:17:51,220 --> 01:17:56,060
When faced with death, headchance turns the blood of dying creatures into gold?

2472
01:17:56,580 --> 01:17:57,660
That sounds...

2473
01:17:57,660 --> 01:18:01,020
I don't know what that is, but that sounds fucking hardcore.

2474
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:03,960
Eliminate Bobmaster.

2475
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:05,900
Is this Bobmaster?

2476
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:09,720
Are they still just like...

2477
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:12,480
Like, what am I looking at?

2478
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:13,720
Wait.

2479
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:16,460
Are you serious?

2480
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:18,020
Because I...

2481
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:19,760
I swear to God.

2482
01:18:19,940 --> 01:18:21,400
Did they claim my money?

2483
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:22,980
I swear to God.

2484
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:24,140
Did they claim my money?

2485
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:24,800
Did they...

2486
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:25,680
Did they claim it?

2487
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:29,380
Oh, my God.

2488
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:30,240
I...

2489
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:33,940
It's because I did all the work that they...

2490
01:18:33,940 --> 01:18:34,060
Oh.

2491
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:36,040
Oh, my...

2492
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:36,420
Oh.

2493
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:37,360
Oh.

2494
01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:40,780
It's fine.

2495
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:42,120
It's fine.

2496
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:43,100
I'm fine.

2497
01:18:43,820 --> 01:18:45,080
I am fine.

2498
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:47,000
I am...

2499
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:47,640
I'm fine.

2500
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:50,020
It's fine.

2501
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:50,960
We'll just...

2502
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:52,280
We don't need it.

2503
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:53,560
What are they called?

2504
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:55,220
Like, the people you outsource...

2505
01:18:55,220 --> 01:18:55,960
Like, the merc...

2506
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:57,800
We don't need these fucking mercenaries.

2507
01:18:58,140 --> 01:18:58,600
We...

2508
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,700
We'll build our own defenses.

2509
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:04,120
We don't need these mercenaries.

2510
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:06,580
We have the tower.

2511
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:09,000
What is this?

2512
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:14,100
All units dying in it generates gold.

2513
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:16,200
But, like, are they my units still?

2514
01:19:16,420 --> 01:19:17,320
Like, I...

2515
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:19,860
Are they my units that generate it?

2516
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:21,200
Or, like, the end...

2517
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:22,700
My contract is...

2518
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:22,860
Yeah.

2519
01:19:28,860 --> 01:19:29,460
Here.

2520
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:30,480
Here's another 100.

2521
01:19:30,820 --> 01:19:32,620
Why are you so scared?

2522
01:19:32,740 --> 01:19:34,100
They're level 1!

2523
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:35,640
I don't...

2524
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:37,120
Why are you so scared?

2525
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:38,160
They're literally...

2526
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:38,720
They're level 1.

2527
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:39,700
They're level 1.

2528
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:41,180
Who's gonna hurt you?

2529
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:48,700
We're turning the cowgirls into gold.

2530
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:51,380
The rats will do it for some cheese.

2531
01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:52,420
Just saying.

2532
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:53,440
I'm just saying.

2533
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:55,340
Who's gonna hurt you?

2534
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:56,660
They're level 1!

2535
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:00,320
Okay.

2536
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:00,760
We...

2537
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:02,300
Oh, I forgot to build the...

2538
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:02,940
Laboratory.

2539
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:04,680
I don't know what the Laboratory does.

2540
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:06,540
But let's just build it for the sake of it.

2541
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:10,800
Okay.

2542
01:20:11,180 --> 01:20:11,340
Okay.

2543
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:12,420
They're all defending it here.

2544
01:20:12,620 --> 01:20:13,100
I'll just...

2545
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:13,860
I'll keep looking.

2546
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:15,820
Eventually, they'll die, right?

2547
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:17,480
Eventually.

2548
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:21,400
Look at all the people that was like, I don't want to do this mission.

2549
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:24,120
Okay.

2550
01:20:24,180 --> 01:20:24,760
Not gonna lie.

2551
01:20:24,860 --> 01:20:26,020
This game is very addicting.

2552
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:29,080
By the way.

2553
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:33,320
If you guys forgot, I am sponsored to play it.

2554
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:35,080
But this game is actually pretty addicting.

2555
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:41,440
So, if you guys want to check it out yourself, you can actually download the game.

2556
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:43,620
Buy and download the game right now.

2557
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:44,620
Oh, hey.

2558
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:45,260
There's Dilbert.

2559
01:20:46,860 --> 01:20:48,520
Maybe the wolves will do it.

2560
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:49,000
Something.

2561
01:20:49,780 --> 01:20:50,160
Maybe?

2562
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:52,120
Okay.

2563
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:52,980
At least the wolves.

2564
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:53,780
Look at that!

2565
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:54,660
The wolves!

2566
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:55,980
Oh, my God.

2567
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:57,800
I paid $500 for the wolves.

2568
01:20:57,940 --> 01:20:58,440
Look at that.

2569
01:20:58,540 --> 01:20:58,780
See?

2570
01:20:59,020 --> 01:20:59,400
Look at...

2571
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:00,140
Oh, my God.

2572
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:01,160
They died instantly.

2573
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:01,940
Okay.

2574
01:21:02,060 --> 01:21:03,040
Maybe I can tell...

2575
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:03,320
Okay.

2576
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:07,020
I think there's a reason why they did not want to fight these guys.

2577
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:08,020
Oh, my God.

2578
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:09,680
They actually just died instantly.

2579
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:15,240
Oh, man.

2580
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,580
Maybe they were right.

2581
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:20,600
Okay.

2582
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:23,100
We'll delete that.

2583
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:25,900
We'll delete that.

2584
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:26,240
Yeah.

2585
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:30,840
I think I now know why they did not want to do anything with them.

2586
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:32,540
I understand now.

2587
01:21:32,820 --> 01:21:34,140
I sort of understand.

2588
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:37,460
Maybe there was...

2589
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:39,180
They were high to something.

2590
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:40,300
Holy shit.

2591
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:41,380
How far does it...

2592
01:21:41,380 --> 01:21:42,200
Oh, my God.

2593
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:43,100
There's more over here.

2594
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:45,480
I don't know if you guys noticed this, but there's more over here.

2595
01:21:47,180 --> 01:21:47,600
Okay.

2596
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:50,860
Uh...

2597
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:53,920
All right.

2598
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:55,420
Oh, my gosh.

2599
01:21:56,540 --> 01:21:57,820
I'll open my chest here.

2600
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:00,840
Your gold vent.

2601
01:22:00,940 --> 01:22:02,360
When faced with adventures, I have a chance.

2602
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:03,200
When faced with death.

2603
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:04,100
It's the same thing.

2604
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:06,980
Okay.

2605
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:07,880
I guess that's fine.

2606
01:22:08,260 --> 01:22:09,600
Increases this thing, though.

2607
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:11,280
How big?

2608
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:11,500
Yeah.

2609
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:12,400
I looked at it.

2610
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:15,260
I was like, okay, that guy's pretty fucking big.

2611
01:22:15,860 --> 01:22:16,700
I'm not a dealer.

2612
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:17,740
Where's my lab?

2613
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,160
I built a lab here.

2614
01:22:19,340 --> 01:22:20,560
I don't know what this lab does.

2615
01:22:26,510 --> 01:22:30,150
Oh, I guess it does strength potions.

2616
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:32,950
Can I even...

2617
01:22:32,950 --> 01:22:34,470
Oh, it's for my adventures.

2618
01:22:34,890 --> 01:22:36,470
My adventures...

2619
01:22:36,470 --> 01:22:39,610
My mercenaries, contractors spend money in my city.

2620
01:22:39,870 --> 01:22:42,130
So I can gain the money back.

2621
01:22:42,410 --> 01:22:43,230
Oh, my God.

2622
01:22:43,230 --> 01:22:44,090
That's so smart.

2623
01:22:44,850 --> 01:22:47,810
If I build more of these, they'll spend more money in my city.

2624
01:22:48,890 --> 01:22:49,630
Oh, my God.

2625
01:22:49,690 --> 01:22:50,290
Not the rats.

2626
01:22:51,130 --> 01:22:51,810
Oh, my God.

2627
01:22:51,950 --> 01:22:52,830
Not the fucking rats.

2628
01:22:53,030 --> 01:22:53,970
Did I not build...

2629
01:22:53,970 --> 01:22:54,870
Oh, my God.

2630
01:22:54,870 --> 01:22:55,630
It's your con.

2631
01:22:55,950 --> 01:22:56,410
Okay, wait.

2632
01:22:57,210 --> 01:22:59,250
I'll build like a little...

2633
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:01,350
Did they just run past my defense tower?

2634
01:23:01,570 --> 01:23:03,450
Oh, it's because they came from that sewer.

2635
01:23:03,790 --> 01:23:05,910
The free money glitch.

2636
01:23:06,370 --> 01:23:07,290
Yeah, I was thinking.

2637
01:23:07,450 --> 01:23:12,530
I was like, they'll spend money in my city with the money I paid them.

2638
01:23:13,690 --> 01:23:14,690
That's so smart.

2639
01:23:16,230 --> 01:23:17,050
Alright, guys.

2640
01:23:17,490 --> 01:23:17,850
Okay.

2641
01:23:18,510 --> 01:23:19,470
I have to...

2642
01:23:19,470 --> 01:23:20,110
Oh, my gosh.

2643
01:23:20,230 --> 01:23:21,470
Okay, I might play this more off stream.

2644
01:23:21,650 --> 01:23:23,350
Because like, this is actually pretty...

2645
01:23:23,350 --> 01:23:24,510
Pretty addicting.

2646
01:23:25,150 --> 01:23:25,590
But...

2647
01:23:27,030 --> 01:23:28,090
I have to stop.

2648
01:23:28,250 --> 01:23:29,270
I have to stop.

2649
01:23:29,270 --> 01:23:31,310
Because I have a lot to do later.

2650
01:23:31,530 --> 01:23:32,870
But that was fun, though.

2651
01:23:33,830 --> 01:23:35,150
That was really, really...

2652
01:23:35,150 --> 01:23:36,450
Because I have to prep for my next stream.

2653
01:23:36,650 --> 01:23:38,310
But that was really, really fun.

2654
01:23:38,710 --> 01:23:40,730
I hope that you guys...

2655
01:23:40,730 --> 01:23:42,790
Uh, you guys enjoyed...

2656
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:44,870
Uh, today's stream, guys.

2657
01:23:45,290 --> 01:23:47,290
Um, a huge shout out to...

2658
01:23:47,290 --> 01:23:48,270
Uh, oh, my gosh.

2659
01:23:48,350 --> 01:23:48,510
No.

2660
01:23:48,730 --> 01:23:49,310
I paused.

2661
01:23:54,610 --> 01:23:55,050
I...

2662
01:23:55,050 --> 01:23:56,490
Wait, I just realized I couldn't...

2663
01:23:56,490 --> 01:23:57,830
I didn't even fast forward this.

2664
01:23:57,970 --> 01:24:00,390
I was playing everything in slow motion.

2665
01:24:00,550 --> 01:24:00,850
Okay, wait.

2666
01:24:01,070 --> 01:24:01,510
Maybe...

2667
01:24:01,510 --> 01:24:03,230
I want to see if this...

2668
01:24:03,230 --> 01:24:05,270
I want to see, like...

2669
01:24:05,730 --> 01:24:07,570
Dad, why are you just looking at them?

2670
01:24:08,030 --> 01:24:08,690
Dad, please.

2671
01:24:09,530 --> 01:24:10,770
Dad, please help out.

2672
01:24:10,930 --> 01:24:11,610
Oh, my God.

2673
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:13,070
I wanted to see if this works.

2674
01:24:13,350 --> 01:24:14,730
But it didn't matter.

2675
01:24:15,270 --> 01:24:15,710
Because...

2676
01:24:17,830 --> 01:24:18,790
I didn't realize...

2677
01:24:18,790 --> 01:24:20,530
I forgot to fast forward this game.

2678
01:24:20,750 --> 01:24:22,110
I was playing at 1x.

2679
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:24,370
But even then, it felt fast enough.

2680
01:24:24,610 --> 01:24:25,250
At 1x.

2681
01:24:26,270 --> 01:24:26,710
Um...

2682
01:24:26,710 --> 01:24:27,450
But anyway...

2683
01:24:27,450 --> 01:24:28,530
You guys want to...

2684
01:24:28,530 --> 01:24:30,310
You guys want to check out this game?

2685
01:24:30,530 --> 01:24:30,970
Um...

2686
01:24:30,970 --> 01:24:31,930
You can do so...

2687
01:24:31,930 --> 01:24:32,350
Um...

2688
01:24:32,350 --> 01:24:34,430
By clicking the link pinned in my chat.

2689
01:24:34,650 --> 01:24:35,570
And in my description.

2690
01:24:36,430 --> 01:24:36,870
Um...

2691
01:24:36,870 --> 01:24:38,030
It was very interesting.

2692
01:24:38,390 --> 01:24:38,870
Because, like...

2693
01:24:38,870 --> 01:24:39,730
When they, like...

2694
01:24:39,730 --> 01:24:39,950
Uh...

2695
01:24:39,950 --> 01:24:40,650
Approached us.

2696
01:24:40,770 --> 01:24:41,570
They were actually...

2697
01:24:41,570 --> 01:24:42,230
Like...

2698
01:24:42,230 --> 01:24:44,810
They were actually thinking about adding dragoons in here, too.

2699
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:45,350
In the future.

2700
01:24:45,490 --> 01:24:46,530
I don't know if it will happen.

2701
01:24:46,930 --> 01:24:48,010
But if they do...

2702
01:24:48,010 --> 01:24:48,890
That would be really cool.

2703
01:24:49,190 --> 01:24:49,550
Um...

2704
01:24:49,550 --> 01:24:51,050
And I would love to play the game again.

2705
01:24:51,090 --> 01:24:52,270
When the dragoons are added.

2706
01:24:53,570 --> 01:24:53,930
Um...

2707
01:24:53,930 --> 01:24:55,210
But I'm not sure...

2708
01:24:55,210 --> 01:24:56,610
I'm not sure, like...

2709
01:24:56,610 --> 01:24:57,790
If it will happen, though.

2710
01:25:02,050 --> 01:25:02,590
Um...

2711
01:25:02,590 --> 01:25:02,670
Um...

2712
01:25:02,670 --> 01:25:03,390
But it was, like, fun.

2713
01:25:03,470 --> 01:25:04,630
I haven't played a...

2714
01:25:04,630 --> 01:25:06,110
I haven't played a...

2715
01:25:06,110 --> 01:25:06,430
Uh...

2716
01:25:06,430 --> 01:25:07,230
RTS in a while.

2717
01:25:07,690 --> 01:25:08,150
Um...

2718
01:25:08,150 --> 01:25:09,170
So it was really fun.

2719
01:25:09,450 --> 01:25:09,990
Uh...

2720
01:25:09,990 --> 01:25:11,170
Controlling my min...

2721
01:25:11,170 --> 01:25:11,610
Little...

2722
01:25:11,610 --> 01:25:13,610
My little men and cow women.

2723
01:25:18,210 --> 01:25:18,750
Um...

2724
01:25:18,750 --> 01:25:19,550
Uh...

2725
01:25:19,550 --> 01:25:19,790
But yeah.

2726
01:25:20,130 --> 01:25:21,450
Thank you again for...

2727
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:22,590
Thank you again for the sponsor.

2728
01:25:23,670 --> 01:25:24,190
Um...

2729
01:25:24,190 --> 01:25:24,910
And...

2730
01:25:24,910 --> 01:25:25,210
Uh...

2731
01:25:25,210 --> 01:25:26,650
I hope you guys enjoyed watching.

2732
01:25:27,070 --> 01:25:27,550
Um...

2733
01:25:27,550 --> 01:25:29,050
It really did not feel like a sponsor.

2734
01:25:29,210 --> 01:25:29,490
I was...

2735
01:25:29,490 --> 01:25:30,610
I got, like, way into it.

2736
01:25:31,070 --> 01:25:31,590
Um...

2737
01:25:31,590 --> 01:25:31,850
I got...

2738
01:25:31,850 --> 01:25:32,950
Let's give, like, Dad...

2739
01:25:32,950 --> 01:25:34,070
One last...

2740
01:25:34,070 --> 01:25:34,930
Escaping!

2741
01:25:37,450 --> 01:25:38,530
What the fuck?

2742
01:25:38,790 --> 01:25:39,090
No!

2743
01:25:39,350 --> 01:25:40,530
You are not...

2744
01:25:41,210 --> 01:25:41,730
Escaping!

2745
01:25:42,030 --> 01:25:42,770
They're like...

2746
01:25:42,770 --> 01:25:43,970
She's ending it!

2747
01:25:44,110 --> 01:25:46,990
It's time that I can finally leave the city!

2748
01:25:47,430 --> 01:25:47,950
Dad!

2749
01:25:48,430 --> 01:25:48,830
What?

2750
01:25:49,790 --> 01:25:50,850
I'm like, I was...

2751
01:25:50,850 --> 01:25:54,290
There's two options for them to escape!

2752
01:25:54,890 --> 01:25:55,690
Like...

2753
01:25:55,690 --> 01:25:57,510
What the fuck?

2754
01:25:58,010 --> 01:25:58,170
What?

2755
01:25:58,490 --> 01:26:01,010
The fact there's two options...

2756
01:26:01,010 --> 01:26:01,550
They're like, yeah!

2757
01:26:04,230 --> 01:26:06,970
Time to seek our freedom!

2758
01:26:07,670 --> 01:26:10,730
He wants...

2759
01:26:10,730 --> 01:26:11,470
Like, both!

2760
01:26:11,690 --> 01:26:13,870
There's two options where, like...

2761
01:26:13,870 --> 01:26:14,290
I...

2762
01:26:14,290 --> 01:26:16,090
Plan A, escape!

2763
01:26:16,470 --> 01:26:17,930
Plan B, escape!

2764
01:26:17,950 --> 01:26:18,150
Game!

2765
01:26:18,410 --> 01:26:18,810
Again!

2766
01:26:19,430 --> 01:26:19,830
And...

2767
01:26:19,830 --> 01:26:21,730
Anyway, guys...

2768
01:26:22,930 --> 01:26:23,330
Anyway...

2769
01:26:23,330 --> 01:26:23,770
Um...

2770
01:26:23,770 --> 01:26:25,070
What the fuck is Dad doing?

2771
01:26:25,510 --> 01:26:25,910
Um...

2772
01:26:25,910 --> 01:26:27,490
I hope you guys had a fun time watching.

2773
01:26:27,670 --> 01:26:28,550
I had a fun time playing.

2774
01:26:29,170 --> 01:26:29,570
Um...

2775
01:26:29,570 --> 01:26:31,190
And like I said, please check out the game.

2776
01:26:31,570 --> 01:26:31,970
Um...

2777
01:26:31,970 --> 01:26:33,770
It really will help out the chat a lot.

2778
01:26:34,030 --> 01:26:34,610
And, you know...

2779
01:26:34,610 --> 01:26:36,670
Maybe we'll get Dragoons later on in the line, too.

2780
01:26:37,270 --> 01:26:37,670
Um...

2781
01:26:37,670 --> 01:26:38,710
But yeah, everyone...

2782
01:26:38,710 --> 01:26:39,110
Um...

2783
01:26:39,110 --> 01:26:40,710
We do have another stream later today.

2784
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:41,470
Uh...

2785
01:26:41,470 --> 01:26:42,010
With...

2786
01:26:42,010 --> 01:26:42,070
With...

2787
01:26:42,070 --> 01:26:42,350
With...

2788
01:26:42,350 --> 01:26:42,530
With Ramen.

2789
01:26:43,130 --> 01:26:43,570
Um...

2790
01:26:43,570 --> 01:26:45,670
It is a very interesting stream concept.

2791
01:26:45,990 --> 01:26:47,990
I actually don't know what's gonna happen.

2792
01:26:48,050 --> 01:26:49,390
Because they planned the stream out.

2793
01:26:49,730 --> 01:26:49,950
Um...

2794
01:26:49,950 --> 01:26:52,370
But it has something to do with 10 microwaves, apparently.

2795
01:26:52,710 --> 01:26:53,430
But anyway, guys...

2796
01:26:53,430 --> 01:26:54,050
I'll see you...

2797
01:26:54,050 --> 01:26:55,930
I'll rate that stream later, too.

2798
01:26:56,010 --> 01:26:56,810
As always, everybody...

2799
01:26:56,810 --> 01:26:57,470
Stay hydrated.

2800
01:26:57,690 --> 01:26:58,110
Pause to check.

2801
01:26:58,270 --> 01:27:00,010
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

2802
01:27:00,130 --> 01:27:00,610
And if you...

2803
01:27:00,610 --> 01:27:01,270
Say up for me...

2804
01:27:01,270 --> 01:27:01,890
Head to bed!

2805
01:27:01,890 --> 01:27:02,450
Because...

2806
01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:03,210
You deserve it!

2807
01:27:03,330 --> 01:27:04,670
I'll see you guys next time, everybody!

2808
01:27:04,990 --> 01:27:05,630
Bye, guys!

2809
01:27:05,930 --> 01:27:06,390
Bye!
