1
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,700
Oh.

2
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,180
Oh.

3
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,320
Oh.

4
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:52,820
Oh.

5
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,300
It's time.

6
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:06,000
You've all waited 50 years for this moment.

7
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,000
Boy, it's not over the doors like a sliding thing.

8
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:12,940
Oh!

9
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,540
You guys deal with a death counter.

10
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,720
You guys count in your head.

11
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,200
I don't want to put my shame.

12
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,800
Oh, fuck it.

13
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,080
I'll put my shame out here.

14
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:30,840
Alright.

15
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,220
Let me get the death counter.

16
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,080
Let me get that in.

17
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,300
Oh, thank you for the magenta soup.

18
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:43,900
Thank you.

19
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:44,640
Thank you.

20
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,680
Let's go!

21
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,600
Zyko, thank you for the magenta soup.

22
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:50,640
Thank you.

23
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,320
Thank you.

24
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,360
Let's freakin go.

25
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,080
It's been 84 years.

26
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,880
This is it.

27
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,060
This is what we've been waiting for.

28
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,660
Finally, she's doing the thing.

29
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,880
Oh my God.

30
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,880
Guys, I need to like remember word.

31
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,800
Okay.

32
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,620
What is it?

33
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:30,340
App for counting twi- Guys, I don't remember what I used for number counting twi- Guys, I don't remember what I used for number counting twi- Give me a sec.

34
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:36,180
I knew I had something for it, but I don't remember where it is.

35
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,280
It's been so long.

36
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,900
It's actually been so fucking long.

37
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,460
Okay, tally counting.

38
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,480
All right.

39
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,500
Tally counting.

40
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,820
Okay, count up and- Okay, it's a- Oh, it's an OBS.

41
00:03:52,180 --> 00:04:00,320
Okay, well, does anyone have- Does anyone have a program that can use to get a tally thing?

42
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,760
Does anyone have one?

43
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,060
Um- Johnny, thank you for the Magenta Supa.

44
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:06,920
Thank you, thank you.

45
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,780
We awaited this day.

46
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,320
Now the prophecy shall be complete.

47
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,260
Thank you for the Magenta Supa.

48
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,120
Thank you, thank you.

49
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,440
NS, thank you for the Super Chat.

50
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,320
Thank you, thank you.

51
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,600
Welcome to die.

52
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:21,540
Um...

53
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:22,800
Aphelion.

54
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,940
Krish, thank you for the 10 gifted ships and 5 gifted ships.

55
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,140
Thank you, thank you.

56
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,180
Uh, Zekra, thank you for the Akka Supa.

57
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,040
Thank you, thank you.

58
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,120
The Toki Ring is finally happening.

59
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:41,220
Ah, I don't wanna tap out and tap in every time I die.

60
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,220
That's more shame.

61
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,620
I have to pause and then like register that I fucking died.

62
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,540
And then we do it all over again.

63
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,560
We are not tapping in and out.

64
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,800
We are not doing that.

65
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,760
I wanna just press a button and then it registers.

66
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,320
And then I just go straight in and never change my strategy.

67
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,660
And just keep brute forcing it until something dies.

68
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:13,800
Like...

69
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,160
There's a reason why we haven't played Souls games.

70
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,920
And so fucking lie.

71
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,360
You know when was the last time we played Souls games?

72
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,800
Fucking Bloodborne.

73
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,420
You have to bribe me to fucking keep playing Souls games.

74
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,380
You have to bribe me to fucking keep playing Souls games.

75
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,580
Just like a real gamer.

76
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,360
You have to fucking bribe me to do this.

77
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,080
Okay.

78
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,960
Um, there's a mod.

79
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:40,400
Okay.

80
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,740
Elden Ring mod.

81
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,380
Oh my god.

82
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,180
Now I can look at my death counter.

83
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,060
Okay.

84
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,020
This is a mod.

85
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:49,800
Alright.

86
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,720
Okay.

87
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,680
Where's this mod that you speak of?

88
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,100
I know I could have researched.

89
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,040
I didn't research anything about Elden Ring.

90
00:05:59,320 --> 00:05:59,740
The only...

91
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,280
I told you guys.

92
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,600
My only experience in Elden Ring was helping my dad.

93
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,820
I don't remember why.

94
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,240
It was like kill a boss.

95
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:06,900
Because he...

96
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,840
He was like fucking 60 levels above what he should be.

97
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,300
He was 60 plus levels above what he should fucking be.

98
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,820
And couldn't even kill the first story boss.

99
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,240
So he gave me the controller and killed the first story boss.

100
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,080
Um...

101
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,060
Because he did some fucking...

102
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:27,760
Um...

103
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,720
Unlimited...

104
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,400
He did some...

105
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:29,900
What was it?

106
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,700
Some glitch where you fight these people on the cliffs.

107
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:36,100
Over and over and over and over again.

108
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,000
To get like more and more souls.

109
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,160
And then he still couldn't beat the...

110
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,500
And he was a fucking magic user too.

111
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:43,780
Like he...

112
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,300
He was a...

113
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,220
He was a fucking...

114
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:47,980
I would...

115
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,300
I remember just waking up.

116
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,180
Seeing my dad on the PlayStation 5.

117
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,080
And he still be on the cliff.

118
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,100
Still farming those things.

119
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,640
I don't remember what they were.

120
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,060
And then like...

121
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:00,640
He still...

122
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,140
I was like...

123
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,720
Oh, did you fight your first boss yet?

124
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,540
And he's like...

125
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,760
No, I keep dying.

126
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,880
And I was like...

127
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,280
How?

128
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,500
You're like...

129
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,020
I'm pretty sure he was 60 plus levels above what he should be.

130
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,620
On the first boss.

131
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,800
So I was like...

132
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,240
How?

133
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,100
And then I...

134
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,700
I don't remember if I first tried or second tried the boss.

135
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,480
Because I do one hit.

136
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,420
And then the boss was like...

137
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,280
Lost like...

138
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,940
30% of his HP.

139
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,720
I...

140
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,420
I was like...

141
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,220
I was like...

142
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:34,460
I was like...

143
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,260
How?

144
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,860
I was like...

145
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,640
How?

146
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,400
How?

147
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:39,780
I was...

148
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,680
I don't know.

149
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:41,720
Do we...

150
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,100
Maybe he's just old.

151
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,660
That's gonna be you.

152
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,740
That's gonna be you when you're at a dad age.

153
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,800
That's right.

154
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,980
You're gonna be like, I'm a gamer.

155
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:55,880
And then you have to give your controller to your fucking kid.

156
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,040
To help you beat bosses.

157
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,920
That's gonna be you one day.

158
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,030
That's not...

159
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,060
No!

160
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:05,800
Yeah.

161
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,520
You're gonna be like, I don't know how I can kill this boss.

162
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,040
It's just...

163
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,800
And then you have to give your controller to your child.

164
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,880
And your child's gonna first try it.

165
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,140
That's gonna be you.

166
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,440
That's the day I quit.

167
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:20,500
No.

168
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:21,480
No.

169
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,700
Don't say that.

170
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,320
Don't...

171
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,760
Don't...

172
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,360
Don't...

173
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:39,500
Yeah.

174
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,400
Seats many tarnished.

175
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,800
Walk among the dragoons.

176
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,240
Bound by grace.

177
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,240
And united by the love for Elden Ring.

178
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,420
Thank you to Akasupa.

00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,480
I heard bleed was good.

191
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,180
I don't know what any of that means.

192
00:08:59,540 --> 00:08:59,900
But...

193
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,880
You guys just see my chat and be like, Oh, I hope she goes for bleed build.

194
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,560
Or like, I hope she does this build.

195
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,240
I...

196
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,840
I have no idea what those words mean.

197
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,840
But like...

198
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,020
Cool.

199
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,640
Um...

200
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:13,800
Okay.

201
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:14,680
Alright.

202
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:15,600
So...

203
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,980
Is it a Nexus mod?

204
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,880
The death counter shit?

205
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:19,880
Or like...

206
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,680
Can I...

207
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:20,940
Okay.

208
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,840
I don't know.

209
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:22,520
Alright.

210
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,240
This mod has been set...

211
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,780

212
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:25,980
Okay.

00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:26,440

00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,820
Please use this...

215
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,500

216
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,560
Oh shit.

217
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,000
Okay.

218
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,920
Def counter.

219
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,500
Is a tool that automatically counts the number of deaths in Elden Ring.

220
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,620
Works with anti...

221
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,140
It can be used with OBS.

222
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,660
No need to use the script.

223
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,300
It will automatically load the deaths that are there before it was installed.

224
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,360
Okay.

225
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,040
Okay.

226
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:50,300

00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,500

Okay.

232
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,340

238
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,100

239
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,080

00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,140

Alright.

245
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,420

Um...

257
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,120
Kids being bosses.

258
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:29,740
Bold of you to assume any of us will ever be anything but Maiden West.

259
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,500

Oh, they have to reactivate my account.

265
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,160
You sure you don't know what's important before it's gone.

266
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:41,640
Either way.

267
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,540

I'm downloading it.

275
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,060
Guys.

276
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,300
I'm downloading it so we can have our death...

277
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,040
We can have our stupid fucking death counter.

278
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:54,700
Alright.

279
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,000
Okay.

280
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,060
Let's see.

281
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,460
I already forgot how to install this.

282
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:01,860
Alright.

283
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,660
What it says.

284
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,360
Know you to use this...

285
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:04,600
Okay.

286
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,980

287
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:06,420

288
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,220
Okay.

00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:07,840
Next.

290
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,020
Install.

291
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,760
Finished.

292
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,200
Select your game if you're using global mod that's own chain.

293
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,400
Select that you don't need to create that one.

294
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,280
Just select the folder when you want.

295
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,120
Necessary.

296
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,580
Change the format.

297
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,580
You have multiple characters.

298
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,020
Select the profile index you want to use.

299
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:25,960
What?

300
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:26,440
Oh.

301
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,940
I have to create the text.

302
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,400
Okay.

303
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,300

304
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,400

313
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,600
I figured it out.

314
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,260
Alright.

315
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,500
I need to find the app data.

316
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,840
We're doing it live.

317
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,480

00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,740
So if you want to do it too.

325
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:58,500
Then.

326
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,240
Like you know.

So now you know how to do it.

330
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,820
For your own playthrough.

331
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,880
So like.

332
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,200
You know.

00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm basically educating people.

334
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,200
I'm Woah.

335
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,020

App data.

337
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,240
Elden Ring.

338
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,620
Where the fuck is my app data?

339
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,700
Okay, where did I install Elden Ring?

340
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:23,140
Okay, app... Where the fuck is my app data?

341
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,180
Where... Okay, guys, where does app data usually go to?

342
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,040
Where does app data usually exist in?

343
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,660
Where does it exist?

344
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,040
Guys, we're learning together!

345
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,260
Where?

346
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,560
Okay, app data.

347
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,720
I'll search this up.

348
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,240
Wait, why didn't it take me to app data?

349
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,220
Where the fuck is it?

350
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:55,580
Okay.

351
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,320
Go to control plus... Oh.

352
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,660
Oh, okay.

353
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,880
I got this, guys.

354
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:02,500
Control.

355
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,360
All right, guys, we're learning together.

356
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,880
Guys, I know there are people out there who are like, what the fuck is app data?

357
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,520
Like, I can't be the only one that's stupid.

358
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,320
I found app data!

359
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,960
You know how I did it?

360
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,100
I didn't read chat.

361
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:18,660
I...

362
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:23,320
I looked at control R app data.

363
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,700
Now, where is Elden Ring?

364
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,760
Where the fuck...

365
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,840
Is it because I never...

366
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,240
Oh, is it because I haven't ran Elden Ring yet that it doesn't exist yet?

367
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,140
Okay, guys.

368
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,240
I'm gonna run at Elden Ring for the first time.

369
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,100
I'm...

370
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,980
This is the final boss.

371
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:40,840
All right.

372
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,200
Skellum, thank you for the super chat.

373
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:44,860
Thank you, thank you.

374
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:49,020
If she's having this much trouble, imagine her trying to stream the Dead Space remake.

375
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,100
Hey, look.

376
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,680
It worked in the end.

377
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,980
It worked in...

378
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,880
I'd do anything for my frames.

379
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,480
Thank you for the super chat.

380
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,000

382
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,580
All right.

383
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,860
First time running Elden Ring.

384
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,880
Okay, let me...

385
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,400
All right.

386
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,300
Also, how's the mic?

387
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,600
We did some little...

388
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,160
Um, we adjusted the mic settings after the last...

389
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:12,960
After stream yesterday.

390
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,080
So, I hope that I sound a little bit better.

391
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,020
I hope...

392
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:17,620
Okay, thank God.

393
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,340
I was like, I hope I'm not lagging.

394
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,120
So, we adjusted it a little bit.

395
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:26,820
All right.

396
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,120
Okay.

397
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,080
Oh, I forgot to show my game on...

398
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,020
God damn it.

399
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,780
God damn it.

400
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,580
Okay, there it is.

401
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:35,380
All right.

402
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:37,820
You got this.

403
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,360
All right.

404
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,860
I don't know if I should play with mouse and keyboard or controller.

405
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:46,520
Because I feel like reaction-wise, I might react better with mouse and keyboard.

406
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:53,300
But then rage-wise, I think my viewers will hate me more if I use mouse and keyboard.

407
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,020
I...

408
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:02,520
I think I would rage bait people more if I use M and K.

409
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,580
Do not use M and K.

410
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:08,680
Okay.

411
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,160
Okay.

412
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,040
Uh...

413
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,500
Enrage the drag goons.

414
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:14,600
All right.

415
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,400
All right.

416
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:16,780
Nice.

417
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:17,600
Okay.

418
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,100
Now.

419
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:18,580
Okay.

420
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,280
New game.

421
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:20,880
Wait.

422
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:21,440
Let me see.

423
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:21,980
System.

424
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:22,780
All right.

425
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,160
Auto target.

426
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:25,880
Okay.

427
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:32,010
Super to enrage the rest of chat.

428
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:33,790
Use mouse and keyboard.

429
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,270
I think you made a super chat.

430
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:36,790
Thank you.

431
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:37,470
Thank you.

432
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,410
I'm just wondering.

433
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:40,370
I know rage bait wise.

434
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:43,890
I know more people will be mad if I use M and K.

435
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,150
Hey guys.

436
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,310
Thank you for the super chat.

437
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:47,630
Thank you.

438
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:48,050
Thank you.

439
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:51,190
Use M and K just to spite them.

440
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,190
All right.

441
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:52,910
Let's see.

442
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:55,310
Um...

443
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:55,510
Wow.

444
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:59,030
I wonder what those controls are in mouse and keyboard.

445
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,770
I wonder what they are.

446
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:02,850
Wow.

447
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:03,850
That's a lot.

448
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,070
A lot of controls.

449
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:06,670
Um...

450
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,790
Def counter.

451
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,270
Mouse and key.

452
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:10,170
All right.

453
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:10,730
Let's see.

454
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:11,830
Advanced settings.

455
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:12,250
Ooh.

456
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:12,650
Hi.

457
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,690
But I just want motion blur, please.

458
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,210
Motion blur off.

459
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,350
All right.

460
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:18,270
That should be good.

461
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,150
Let me see.

462
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,450
I'm just checking if...

463
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:21,790
Yeah.

464
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:22,430
I'm bouncing.

465
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:22,970
All right.

466
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:23,470
Okay.

467
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:24,890
Back.

468
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:25,530
All right.

469
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,150
Uh...

470
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:31,670
But set the on-screen prompts and settings on controller.

471
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:34,090
So no one will know.

472
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:35,030
Wait.

473
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,310
I can do that?

474
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:38,010
Wait.

475
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:39,130
I'll be confused.

476
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:39,790
No.

477
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:40,330
I can't.

478
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:40,770
No.

479
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:43,230
I'll be confused if we do that.

480
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,850
Like, that's gonna fuck me up.

481
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:47,790
I...

482
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:52,130
He's a dance dance revolution dance bat.

483
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:52,650
Right?

484
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,070
So thank you for the super chat.

485
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:54,490
Thank you.

486
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,130
Thank you.

487
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,150
Like, how would that help me?

488
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:57,950
Hehehehe.

489
00:16:58,530 --> 00:16:58,870
Okay.

490
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:00,250
Um...

491
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,370
Music down by one and game...

492
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:04,130
Game volume up.

493
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:04,530
Okay.

494
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,170
Let's see.

495
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:06,650
Okay.

496
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:13,170
We'll do music volume down by one and then game volume up.

497
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:13,870
Okay.

498
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,710
Let me know if that's better.

499
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:17,790
I up the game volume a little bit.

500
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:18,090
Okay.

501
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:19,810
Let me just close all these other things.

502
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:20,510
Okay.

503
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,330
Let me find...

504
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:23,250
Let me find...

505
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,330
Did Elder Ring show up yet?

506
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:24,930
Oh, it did.

507
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:25,250
Okay.

508
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:26,390
Elder Ring showed up, guys.

509
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,070
Where the fuck is the...

510
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,310
Save file?

511
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:34,610
Where...

512
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:35,430
Where is it?

513
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,130
Do I have to install it again?

514
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,870
Because I didn't boot up...

515
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:42,370
Maybe I have to install it again because I didn't boot it up.

516
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,010
Oh, no.

517
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:43,690
I don't.

518
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:46,250
Oh, select save file.

519
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:48,530
I don't have a save file.

520
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,190
I don't have one.

521
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,110
I don't...

522
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,210
I don't have one.

523
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,870
What do you want from me?

524
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,670
I don't have one.

525
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:00,370
Okay.

526
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:01,870
There we go.

527
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:07,150
And then... Okay, I guess I'll show up afterwards?

528
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:09,210
Question mark?

529
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,570
Alright, let's see.

530
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,210
Sorry, guys.

531
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,730
I'm just trying to figure this out.

532
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:16,130
There's a... Oh, there it is!

533
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:16,930
Alright.

534
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:19,090
There we go.

535
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,070
Alright, we did it.

536
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:22,310
Defs.

537
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,270
Zero.

538
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:24,910
What if I just kept it at zero?

539
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:25,890
This entire run.

540
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,410
So new people would be, like, so impressed, guys.

541
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,790
They'd be like, wow, I can't believe Doki.

542
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:38,030
I can't believe Doki never died once.

543
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,010
Wait, my mic peeked first?

544
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:46,910
Oh, I'm so sorry.

545
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,910
I got a little closer to my mic.

546
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,190
I'm sorry, guys.

547
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,090
What if it just never moved?

548
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,310
Alright.

549
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,170
Okay, new game.

550
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,270
Uh, adjust brightness until the image on the right.

551
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,690
I mean, that works.

552
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,150
Camera speed.

553
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:07,990
Okay.

554
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:11,880
Alright.

555
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,760
What do I want to be?

556
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,280
What are these?

557
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,360
Show attributes?

558
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,620
Okay, let's see.

559
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,480
Level 9.

560
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,100
Oh, I want to be higher level.

561
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,100
Level.

562
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,600
Oh, I guess this is, like, hard, right?

563
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,540
Oh, I guess this is easy, medium, hard.

564
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,020
Because, like, they're level 7.

565
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,480
No, we are not doing the fucking...

566
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,540
Oh, no, these are classes.

567
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,280
Never mind.

568
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,000
I just realized there's...

569
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,780
There's more.

570
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,180
Okay.

571
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,940
I just realized...

572
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,620
I was like, oh, I get it.

573
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,420
She didn't get it.

574
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,800
I didn't see the arrows.

575
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:45,820
Alright.

576
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,300
Confessor.

577
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,260
Prisoner.

578
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,140
Samurai.

579
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,080
Oh, that's cool.

580
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,020
For...

581
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,000
Uh...

582
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,540
Prophet.

583
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,360
Astrologer.

584
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:57,940
Bandit.

585
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,500
Why would you ever want to be a fucking bandit?

586
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,660
Uh...

587
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,200
Let's see it.

588
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,740
Why are you still on M&K?

589
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,040
That's why.

590
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,020
That's...

591
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,600
That's why.

592
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,980
Has the best starting weapon?

593
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:17,620
Okay.

594
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,080
I'll go with Samurai, then.

595
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,220
Wait.

596
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,280
Where's the pro player?

597
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:21,900
Come on.

598
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,460
Where's the guy that makes guides?

599
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,220
If I'm listening to anyone...

600
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:33,340
I'm listening to the guy who's literally making YouTube videos about Souls games.

601
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,080
I...

602
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,380
Wait.

603
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,980
I swear, if you lie to me...

604
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,540
I swear to fucking God.

605
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,480
I...

606
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,580
Dude.

607
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,800
I swear, if you lie to me and feed me false information...

608
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,340
I will know.

609
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:48,440
Oh.

610
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:52,900
Gladstone.

611
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:53,820
Thank you for the super chat.

612
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:54,200
Thank you.

613
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:54,640
Thank you.

614
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:57,020
For the real 4D chest move.

615
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,080
Use DK bongos instead.

616
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,320
Also, probably have to watch this.

617
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,160
So, enjoy it, goons.

618
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,140
Thank you for the super chat.

619
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:03,520
Thank you.

620
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:03,920
Thank you.

621
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:04,220
Okay.

622
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,820
Do we do Samurai?

623
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,240
Or, like...

624
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:07,860
I don't know.

625
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,520
What else to do?

626
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,200
Everything.

627
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,080
Okay.

628
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,280
But, what is Doki playable?

629
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,260
Oh.

630
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,820
But, anything is usable.

631
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:17,280
Alright.

632
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,200
That's all I need.

633
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,580
I mean, I was looking at Samurai in the first place, too.

634
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,700
I was like, ooh, Samurai.

635
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,920
I look pretty cool.

636
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,860
I guess, like...

637
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,720
I'll make a dragon.

638
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:26,740
Alright.

639
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:29,500
Dragon.

640
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,000
All right.

641
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,460
Zero.

642
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:33,420
Zero.

643
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:33,960
Zero.

644
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,120
Death.

645
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,500
It's so true.

646
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,180
If I write it down, it's true.

647
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,720
Alright.

648
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,080
There we go.

649
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,300
Age.

650
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:49,860
Old.

651
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,440
Origin.

652
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:52,580
Keepsake.

653
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,340
What's Keepsake?

654
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:53,640
No.

655
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,960
The past has been...

656
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,360
Oh!

657
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:56,900
More buffs!

658
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:57,440
Alright.

659
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,900
Increases maximum HP.

660
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,760
The people used to gain many runes.

661
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,280
Said to enhance Sacred Flask.

662
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,480
The fuck does any of this mean?

663
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,440
The Ashes are small, diminutive golems.

664
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,840
Ashes are said to hold spirits within.

665
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,300
The Golden Seed?

666
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:14,560
Oh!

667
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,560
Does it mean more heals?

668
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,460
I believe that's more heals, right?

669
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,600
Oh, fuck god.

670
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:20,720
It's fine.

671
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,560
Okay.

672
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,600
Let's see.

673
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:30,900
Alright.

674
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,940
We'll go with a template.

675
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,980
And then we'll, like, go from there.

676
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:34,860
We'll...

677
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,620
We'll go from there.

678
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:40,440
Alright.

679
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,200
We'll do a template.

680
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,800
And then we'll figure it out.

681
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,340
We'll figure it out.

682
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:45,580
Okay.

683
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,200
Detailed.

684
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,800
Wait, how do I hear the voice?

685
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:56,170
Okay.

686
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:56,990
I like this one.

687
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:57,370
Alright.

688
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:57,890
Where's...

689
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:58,650
Where's purple?

690
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,570
Where's Urpa?

691
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:02,670
Yellow.

692
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:02,990
Sorry.

693
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:03,550
Where's yellow?

694
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:05,590
Sorry!

695
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:09,250
It was reflex from our last Souls games.

696
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:17,730
The last time we did a Souls games, it was just reflex from that.

697
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:20,270
When we made the last dragon.

698
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:22,630
Not your ancestors.

699
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,290
There we go.

700
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:25,350
There we go.

701
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:27,410
That's hot.

702
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:29,070
Whoops.

703
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:32,150
How do I keep this?

704
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:33,130
Okay.

705
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:35,650
How do I accept?

706
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:36,530
E.

707
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:37,110
Okay.

708
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:37,630
There we go.

709
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:38,350
Yellow.

710
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:39,370
Alright.

711
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:40,830
Adjust face.

712
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,290
I remember you can make...

713
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:43,970
You can actually make, like, Bob Ross.

714
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:45,550
Uh...

715
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:45,970
Richard.

716
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:47,790
Alright.

717
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,230
Adjust face template.

718
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,830
I know.

719
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,350
I like the face for this.

720
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:53,470
So far.

721
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:54,870
Oh my god.

722
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:55,530
This is...

723
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:55,690
Okay.

724
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:56,510
Ian.

725
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:57,710
Okay.

726
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:58,910
7D?

727
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:03,700
Like...

728
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,980
Why would this have a bigger nose?

729
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:06,480
Okay.

730
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:06,980
There you go.

731
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,520
Facial aesthetic.

732
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,140
The...

733
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,020
The...

734
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,460
Oh, it's just...

735
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:15,800
Yes.

736
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:16,980
Um...

737
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:22,230
It's like a beak.

738
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:22,930
You know?

739
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,110
Yes.

740
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:25,830
Okay.

741
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,150
Back.

742
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:28,530
Hair.

743
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:30,450
Okay.

744
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:31,570
I should have liked that...

745
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,090
That crazy hair you guys had.

746
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:35,250
Uh...

747
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:38,610
Why do we have to...

748
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:39,490
Because you're a yellow!

749
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:42,370
You're a bird!

750
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:45,710
I actually like the...

751
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:45,990
Where...

752
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,470
What's the crazy hair I got?

753
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:48,530
Oh my god.

754
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:50,010
I could just make Rick Sanchez.

755
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,110
From Rick and Morty.

756
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:52,130
You know what?

757
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:53,090
Wait.

758
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:55,010
What was the other hair that...

759
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:56,910
What is the default hair?

760
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:57,270
Okay.

761
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,250
Default hair is that.

762
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:59,290
I like this.

763
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,230
And then...

764
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:04,530
We'll get...

765
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:05,850
Wait.

766
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,810
What was the color that they gave us?

767
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:08,150
This?

768
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:08,650
Okay.

769
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:09,490
We'll make white.

770
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:10,450
So it's like the...

771
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,290
It's like the horns.

772
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:12,950
You know?

773
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:14,070
It's like...

774
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,270
And it's like Rick Sanchez.

775
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,650
It's like...

776
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:19,630
I really like your Simpsons.

777
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:20,530
See?

778
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:23,350
Okay.

779
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:24,390
What is this?

780
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:25,150
Oh, luster.

781
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:25,670
Okay.

782
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,510
We'll have it here.

783
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,190
And then...

784
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,310
Root darkness.

785
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:31,950
Okay.

786
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:33,610
We got a little shading in here.

787
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,290
I mean...

788
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:35,510
You already have white hair.

789
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,390
So it doesn't matter.

790
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:37,810
Um...

791
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:38,670
I think I'm...

792
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:38,870
Wait.

793
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:39,710
Skin features?

794
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,030
Pores?

795
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:41,990
Dark circles?

796
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:42,590
Yes.

797
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,830
Yes, from watching...

798
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:46,850
From watching me.

799
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,270
No.

800
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:50,770
Yes.

801
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:52,970
From watching me.

802
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:53,850
That makes sense.

803
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,630
What is this?

804
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:58,550
Uh...

805
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,430
No, you guys don't need scars.

806
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:02,630
Uh...

807
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:03,070
Back.

808
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:03,530
Back.

809
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,310
Cosmetic.

810
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:04,770
Eyes.

811
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:07,970
I think eyes are fine.

812
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:08,330
Ooh.

813
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,470
Eyelashes.

814
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,310
Nice.

815
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,610
You're beautiful.

816
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:15,650
But I want it to be a little darker.

817
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:16,850
It's gonna be eyelashes.

818
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:17,290
Okay.

819
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:17,810
There you go.

820
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:18,850
Alright.

821
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,380
Alright.

822
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:23,860
Nice.

823
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:24,400
Okay.

824
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,140
Body time.

825
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,880
Smaller head means...

826
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,280
Less headshots.

827
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,520
The smaller your head, the less we'll get headshot.

828
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:38,940
Guys.

829
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,180
That's how it goes.

830
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,120
We're just reducing our hitbox.

831
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:43,960
We're...

832
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,140
We're reducing our hitbox, guys!

833
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:47,780
Guys!

834
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,060
Uh...

835
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:51,640
We'll keep that.

836
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,540
That's abdomen.

837
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,680
Oh...

838
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,880
I like current...

839
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,400
Oh, my arms.

840
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,440
Okay.

841
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,200
We focus on legs here.

842
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,560
The game.

843
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,860
Okay.

844
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,480
And then...

845
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:10,920
Nice.

846
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,420
Muscular?

847
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:13,860
No.

848
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:14,480
No.

849
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,540
Beautiful.

850
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:18,440
Alright.

851
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,860
I think I'm okay now.

852
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,160
There you go.

853
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:24,680
Exactly.

854
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,020
I saved lives.

855
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,740
The Koomba.

856
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,040
Thank you for the super chat.

857
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,100
Not the Deadpool.

858
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:30,540
Thank you.

859
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,240
Thank you.

860
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,340
Okay.

861
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,580
How do I agree to my character?

862
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,880
There you go.

863
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,440
I did it.

864
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,020
What do I do now?

865
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,680
What do I...

866
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,080
What do I do now?

867
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,420
I... I like this.

868
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,420
This is how... I want to be this.

869
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,510
What do I do?

870
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,550
I want to be this.

871
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,610
How do I... Oh, back out?

872
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:57,990
Okay.

873
00:27:58,810 --> 00:27:59,730
Oh, there you go.

874
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:00,510
Nice.

875
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:01,130
It's okay.

876
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,770
It's not like you can see any...

877
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:04,450
I'm just gonna be wearing clothes anyway.

878
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:07,610
But we'll know on the inside what he looks like.

879
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:10,570
I was gonna say, like, it doesn't matter what we make.

880
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,970
Because in the end, everything's gonna be covered up.

881
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:14,630
But we know in the inside.

882
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,370
What you look like.

883
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:18,330
We know.

884
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:18,710
Noo.

885
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:20,690
Yeah.

886
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:22,550
We know.

887
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,970
You're Rick Sanchez.

888
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,410
Yes.

889
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,470
Well, noo.

890
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,250
We know what you are.

891
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:35,270
On the inside, we're so beautiful.

892
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:45,670
Oh?

893
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:52,770
Hello?

894
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,250
Oh, the game is super low?

895
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:57,590
Sorry, let me fix that.

896
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:02,860
Let me know if it's better.

897
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,880
I can turn it up more.

898
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,320
Oh!

899
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:24,600
Sorry.

900
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,680
Oh, I know him!

901
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,800
He's the guy that turned around.

902
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,480
He turns into a big-ass dragon!

903
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,960
I know him!

904
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,320
That's the girl that everybody wants to bang!

905
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,980
With the multiple arms!

906
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:02,850
So low?

907
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,810
Okay, I'll up the voice more.

908
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:06,310
See?

909
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:08,950
I'm not going in completely blind!

910
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:15,110
Wife!

911
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:21,270
And I'm one of the... What,

912
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,400
is that Melania?

913
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,380
The bitch?

914
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,540
A war leading to abandonment.

915
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,720
Yes.

916
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,020
Like how you don't even, like, correct me.

917
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,660
You're just like, yes, that's her.

918
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,780
Oh!

919
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:53,780
Rise now, ye tarnished, ye dead, who yet live.

920
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:01,640
The call of long-lost grace speaks to us all.

921
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:13,720
Horaloo, chieftain of the Badlands.

922
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:19,280
The ever-brilliant gold mask.

923
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,160
Fear!

924
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,560
Oh, she's cute.

925
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,540
The dead dead companion.

926
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,960
Of her dead husband, I assume.

927
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,060
The lope's a dung eater.

928
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,100
What?

929
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,040
Bro, that's sad.

930
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,480
Your name is the lope's a dung eater?

931
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,940
Oh my god, that's so sad.

932
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,160
We all know him.

933
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,140
Imagine being named a dung eater.

934
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,140
That's your legacy.

935
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:50,200
And then right after, it's the all-knowing.

936
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:50,980
Like...

937
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:54,700
The- Why do the other guys have such good names?

938
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,140
And then he's the fucking shit eater.

939
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,370
He des- He deserves it.

940
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:15,070
You eat dung one time, and then everybody calls you the dung eater.

941
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:19,850
He knows what he did.

942
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:39,030
The Losa Marvel Rivals player.

943
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:40,890
Thank you for the super chat.

944
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:41,550
Thank you, thank you.

945
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:41,990
Oh!

946
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,570
I'm gonna become the Elden Lord!

947
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:44,990
Let's go!

948
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:46,470
Alright.

949
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:50,350
Okay, let's me look at how to attack.

950
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,030
Oh, I assume that's the arrow.

951
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:54,290
Oh, that is.

952
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:54,610
Okay.

953
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:56,290
Set- Oh wait, no.

954
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,310
That's not what I wanted.

955
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,110
Um...

956
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:04,310
Where's my s- I saw- I saw S and I assumed I went straight to like sat- settings.

957
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,010
Uh...

958
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:07,430
I need my sensitivity to be lower.

959
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:08,750
I don't like it.

960
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:11,050
God, why is it Q for back?

961
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:12,930
It's so fucking weird.

962
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:13,710
I don't like that.

963
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,210
Yeah, I'll do three.

964
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:16,150
Okay.

965
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:18,790
Alright, there you go.

966
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:26,340
Though the path be broken and uncertain, claim your place as Elden Lord.

967
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,220
Okay.

968
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,940
I can do that.

969
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,060
Joy ahead.

970
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:31,660
Yay!

971
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,780
Open only those- Wait, what?

972
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,900
Only- open only to those carrying a finger.

973
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:39,440
Oh.

974
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,120
Who has a finger?

975
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,000
Oh, this guy.

976
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,140
Okay.

977
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,440
Yay!

978
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,100
Hey, hey, hey.

979
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,940
Wait, how did you die?

980
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,160
What did you do?

981
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,560
Fucking stupid.

982
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,280
I said that I would do that.

983
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,160
Wait, how did he die?

984
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,100
Wait a minute.

985
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,340
Wait a minute.

986
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,560
I thought that was a cliff.

987
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,560
How did you die?

988
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:13,640
Why?

989
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:25,220
Oh, I'm fucking- I was like, wait a minute.

990
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,080
Okay.

991
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,360
Alright, look.

992
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,560
I-

993
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:37,370
Okay, that was pretty troll.

994
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:40,450
That is pretty troll.

995
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,370
Must be like, items here.

996
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,550
Why else would there be an empty area?

997
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:47,610
Any items?

998
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:49,770
Wait.

999
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:51,330
Why am I using my- Oh shit.

1000
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:52,030
Wait.

1001
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:54,150
Why am I using my arrows?

1002
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:58,370
Why- How do I change?

1003
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:00,370
It's tradition.

1004
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,170
Oh no.

1005
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,590
Oh no.

1006
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,470
How do I change my weapon?

1007
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:09,150
Where's my HUD?

1008
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:10,670
I should have a HUD?

1009
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:16,490
I have no idea.

1010
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:18,550
Oh, HUD to always on.

1011
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:19,350
Good idea.

1012
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:21,830
I was like, I should have a HUD?

1013
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:23,690
I was confused.

1014
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:25,850
Alright, let's see.

1015
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:26,370
HUD?

1016
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:28,270
Oh, it's on auto.

1017
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:29,090
On.

1018
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:29,650
Okay.

1019
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:31,730
There we go.

1020
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:36,270
How do I- How can my sword up?

1021
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:40,110
How does that work?

1022
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,430
Wait, what's this?

1023
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:43,850
Checkpoint ahead?

1024
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,410
The door is blocked shut.

1025
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:47,410
Okay, I can't do that.

1026
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:50,170
Probably arrow keys?

1027
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:50,930
No.

1028
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:53,730
No way.

1029
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:01,910
No way.

1030
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:02,590
That's bad.

1031
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:05,110
That's- That's bad.

1032
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,990
That's- That's really bad.

1033
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:09,830
We got- I'm rebinding that right now.

1034
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,250
It cannot be arrow key.

1035
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:14,690
Let me- Let me rebind that.

1036
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,410
Right now.

1037
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:20,190
Control scroll up?

1038
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:22,950
Bro, no one has time for that.

1039
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:23,990
No one.

1040
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:28,170
What do you mean I can't- Oh my god.

1041
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:29,730
Okay, there we go.

1042
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:31,170
There we go.

1043
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:34,630
That works.

1044
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:37,150
Okay.

1045
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,320
Okay.

1046
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,220
There we go.

1047
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:45,660
I got it.

1048
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,180
I got it.

1049
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:47,980
We go.

1050
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,840
We go straight down.

1051
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,320
First off, tarnish.

1052
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,020
Behold.

1053
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,440
Lift ahead.

1054
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,960
I don't know if I trust him.

1055
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,880
I don't- I don't know.

1056
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,380
He's pointing out there.

1057
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,300
He's pointing out there.

1058
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,260
He's- Hmm.

1059
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,060
Seems off.

1060
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,980
First off, and then praise the message.

1061
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:19,800
Poor!

1062
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:22,000
That's a bad message.

1063
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,220
Alright.

1064
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,680
Never trust.

1065
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,520
E for two hand?

1066
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,460
There's no two hand.

1067
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:39,480
Down- Look, if you ask me to upvote you, I downvote.

1068
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,700
E left click.

1069
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:43,680
Okay.

1070
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,580
Oh.

1071
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:46,900
Okay.

1072
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,760
E left click.

1073
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:49,140
Alright.

1074
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:51,600
If only I had a rump.

1075
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,100
Strange strong foe ahead.

1076
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,060
Rushing in ahead.

1077
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:56,520
Oh!

1078
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,020
This is just- You don't have to fight him.

1079
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,340
Be wary of strong foe.

1080
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,940
See, therefore, revenge.

1081
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,500
Okay, I know like, for this, you die regardless.

1082
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,240
Because...

1083
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,720
My dad tried to redo this multiple times.

1084
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,560
And like, gave up.

1085
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:20,780
I know that you are supposed to die.

1086
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,660
But like, obviously you can kill him if you're good.

1087
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,680
But we know this is gonna be...

1088
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,820
Death counter plus one.

1089
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:34,560
We- If you're- And you think I am good?!

1090
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,140
Didn't expect weak foe.

1091
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:39,760
Why is it always- Okay, goodbye.

1092
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,260
And I have zero heals, guys.

1093
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,440
I have zero heals.

1094
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,400
Like, I-

1095
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,260
That was fast.

1096
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,080
There we go.

1097
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,520
There we go.

1098
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,440
I was like, wait.

1099
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,400
I don't have heals.

1100
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,040
Alright.

1101
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,440
Look!

1102
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,740
I got a dodge.

1103
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:09,620
I dodged.

1104
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,500
One time.

1105
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:12,420
Fair.

1106
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,080
Thank you for the super chat.

1107
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:14,540
Thank you.

1108
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,040
Thank you.

1109
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,200
Viewers choose.

1110
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,340
Mouse and keyboard.

1111
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,020
Instantly regretted.

1112
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,080
I didn't die.

1113
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,760
Look, my death counter says zero.

1114
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,140
I technically did not die.

1115
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,940
Oh, I got my little horsey.

1116
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,120
Oh, I got my little horsey.

1117
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:41,940
Or my goat.

1118
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:51,240
Talk to- Talk to get to play for you.

1119
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,340
Oh, George.

1120
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,400
Thank you for the super chat.

1121
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,300
Thank you, thank you.

1122
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,940
Fortune is on his side.

1123
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,720
Wait, so how many wives do I have?

1124
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,600
Found him here, after all.

1125
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,140
No, no, no, Varson.

1126
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,040
Thank you for the super chat.

1127
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,680
Thank you, thank you.

1128
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,220
Do you not see- Let me- Let me tap the monitor.

1129
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,880
It says zero.

1130
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,100
It says zero.

1131
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,920
One of his kind is sure to seek.

1132
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,780
The Elden Ring.

1133
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:18,600
Even

1134
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:24,810
if it does violate the-

1135
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:34,900
No, no, no.

1136
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,180
Let me tap the screen.

1137
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:37,340
Zero.

1138
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:48,710
You can't say you are Maidenless.

1139
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:50,350
I'm literally playing as you guys.

1140
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:51,710
So you're flaming yourselves.

1141
00:40:57,410 --> 00:41:00,810
And what you say about this character is yourself.

1142
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:03,850
I know what I am.

1143
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:06,930
Oh, nice.

1144
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:07,730
Now I have healers.

1145
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:08,550
Nice.

1146
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:10,630
Blask of Tears?

1147
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:12,090
Cool.

1148
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:13,430
I don't know what that is.

1149
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:15,810
The Cave of Knowledge lies.

1150
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:19,270
Jump down and you'll find- There you can learn more about the game's control.

1151
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:23,590
As well as other tips that will be helpful- Oh wait, I need to do that.

1152
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:29,590
Ready, Tarnish, take the plunge of learning and remembrance.

1153
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:34,230
Recall the arts of war and your warrior's blood.

1154
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:34,730
Okay.

1155
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:37,150
Yay!

1156
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:40,330
Oh.

1157
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:41,850
Oh, okay.

1158
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:43,090
Use.

1159
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:46,850
Okay, and then...

1160
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:49,330
Oh my god.

1161
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:50,590
Okay, we gotta fix that.

1162
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:53,970
Okay, we gotta fix that.

1163
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:56,190
Give me a sec.

1164
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:56,750
Alright.

1165
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:00,150
There we go.

1166
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:02,030
That's a lot better.

1167
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:04,650
Okay.

1168
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:07,710
Alright, we're just figuring this out.

1169
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:11,590
Alright.

1170
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:13,210
Enemy ahead.

1171
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:14,130
Where?

1172
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:19,750
Resting will destroy your HP, FP, and cleanse any- Oh, this is the bonfire.

1173
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:20,370
Okay.

1174
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:22,090
Noah!

1175
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:23,430
I can do this.

1176
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:28,010
Alright.

1177
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:30,490
Where's the enemy?

1178
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:32,290
Be wary of weak foe.

1179
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:33,230
Oh, he's here?

1180
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:34,390
Hello?

1181
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:35,650
Hello?

1182
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:36,270
Oh, there he is.

1183
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:40,950
Oh my god.

1184
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:41,710
He's so weak.

1185
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:43,730
That was so easy.

1186
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:48,050
We have strong attacks?

1187
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:50,450
What does a strong attack do?

1188
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:56,150
Use an on your left hand to guard- Guardings for pussies.

1189
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,640
Guardings for pussy!

1190
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,240
Oh, wait.

1191
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,440
Dodge, roll, and then shift.

1192
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,140
That's fucking right.

1193
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,080
True.

1194
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,200
So true.

1195
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:13,420
Why dodge when I can roll?

1196
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,960
Why- Well spoken.

1197
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,120
Look carefully.

1198
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,060
Time for sniper?

1199
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,820
Where is he?

1200
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,300
Oh, there he is.

1201
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,140
Okay, I can just run past him.

1202
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:31,480
Alright.

1203
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:32,920
Exactly.

1204
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,600
Why- Why guard when I can just roll?

1205
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,460
Each hand can be equipped.

1206
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:40,520
Switch to right.

1207
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:42,040
Wield with two hands.

1208
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:47,580
Can also be making attacks more difficult to repel with shield and boosting- Ooh!

1209
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:48,840
Nice.

1210
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:49,580
I like that.

1211
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,780
What you gonna do, huh?

1212
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:56,160
That's fucking- NOTHING!

1213
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:58,580
That's right!

1214
00:43:58,580 --> 00:43:58,700
What?

1215
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:01,340
Oh, I need to learn how to lock on.

1216
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,420
Wait, I can do jump attack?

1217
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:04,320
Ooh, I can.

1218
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,400
Alright, he's not gonna expect it.

1219
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:07,420
I'm so fast.

1220
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:08,220
Oh!

1221
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:10,760
That's right.

1222
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,340
Can't do jack shit.

1223
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,120
I'm invincible.

1224
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,400
I'm so strong.

1225
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,100
Equip the bow to fight.

1226
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,240
You can equip two types.

1227
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,460
Rage is also for pussies!

1228
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:26,560
Look at that!

1229
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,660
Oh shit!

1230
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:28,400
Oh shit!

1231
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:31,040
I'm so- I forgot to lock on!

1232
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:31,920
Okay.

1233
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:39,800
Alright, all I'm saying is- All I'm saying is that he- He did swap the sword.

1234
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,560
He did swap the sword.

1235
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:47,240
I- That's all I'm saying.

1236
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:48,760
That's all I'm saying.

1237
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,740
Skills are- Using skills consumes FP?

1238
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,300
I- Use it?

1239
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,040
I don't know if I used it.

1240
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,480
Is that- Is that my skill?

1241
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,340
Is that it?

1242
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:11,060
There.

1243
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,080
My first death.

1244
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:15,360
What does it consume?

1245
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:15,800
Oh!

1246
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,040
It consumes my magic!

1247
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:17,780
Oh!

1248
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,720
I was like, the fuck did it consume?

1249
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,820
Crouching can make it harder.

1250
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,160
Especially attacking as knowing it will cause more damage than usual.

1251
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:27,840
Crouch.

1252
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:29,400
Oh, there it is.

1253
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:31,900
Hello, little guy.

1254
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:34,340
Surprise attack!

1255
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:35,580
Alright.

1256
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,740
Look, I was gonna say something similar to that, but I was like, Is that appropriate?

1257
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,560
No, Doki, that's not appropriate.

1258
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:47,820
I- Rube, like, welcome to Tomato Farm.

1259
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:49,100
Welcome, welcome.

1260
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:55,520
I- I contemplated it.

1261
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:57,500
Good!

1262
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:58,380
See?

1263
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:01,780
That's a good appraisal right there.

1264
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:04,560
That's- Oh!

1265
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:05,820
I could've done this!

1266
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,920
Oh my god!

1267
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,940
That would've been even better!

1268
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,120
I'm sad.

1269
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:15,380
Near a critical hit if his back is turned.

1270
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:15,940
Oh!

1271
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:17,260
That's good.

1272
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:20,300
There we go.

1273
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,540
That's the critical hit.

1274
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:25,700
Yeah, but it told me to just left click it.

1275
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:26,620
So I listened.

1276
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:30,340
Yeah, I wanna try this skill.

1277
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:34,240
Sometimes may break giving you a chance to perform a critical hit.

1278
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:37,740
Hold control, charge, control while jumping.

1279
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:38,460
Oh, okay.

1280
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:40,500
Try.

1281
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,840
Is that the critical hit?

1282
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:45,460
Oh shit!

1283
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:46,620
Wait, that looks so cool!

1284
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,180
I'm gonna forget how to do that.

1285
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:53,640
We revived at the last sight of grace that you visited.

1286
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:57,460
However, if there is a state near where you died, you can choose to revive there instead.

1287
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:58,100
Oh, this?

1288
00:46:58,760 --> 00:46:59,940
Why can we revive there?

1289
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:02,260
That's not a crit?

1290
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,800
That's just a posture break?

1291
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:04,780
Oh!

1292
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:08,040
Oh, I have to be closer for it.

1293
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:09,960
But I still looked so cool though!

1294
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:15,050
I looked so cool!

1295
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:16,830
Oh, is this a boss fight?

1296
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:23,060
Oh.

1297
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,840
Wait, but this is a tutorial.

1298
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:29,460
That's r- Oh.

1299
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,320
After blocking...

1300
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,300
Blocking me.

1301
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,620
I don't need a block!

1302
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,060
Oh shit!

1303
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:39,380
Sorry!

1304
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:39,500
Wait!

1305
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:45,740
Okay, it's fine.

1306
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,180
Oh god!

1307
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:49,400
Okay, let me recharge that.

1308
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:50,000
Let me...

1309
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Let me...

1310
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,660
Let me recharge...

1311
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:53,760
I still don't need a block!

1312
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:55,220
That's right!

1313
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:57,560
That's right!

1314
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,380
I told you!

1315
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,100
I don't need a block!

1316
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:09,000
If I never learn how to parry, I'll never learn how to block.

1317
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:11,220
I didn't...

1318
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:11,760
I didn't...

1319
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:11,840
I didn't...

1320
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:12,180
I didn't...

1321
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:12,260
I didn't...

1322
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:12,600
First try!

1323
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,480
I told you!

1324
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,040
She...

1325
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:17,320
What?

1326
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:18,400
That's right!

1327
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,560
Not a blood stain here!

1328
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,320
Look at all these pussies!

1329
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:29,080
Look at all these people that died on the first tutorial box!

1330
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:30,820
Let's go!

1331
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:38,960
All these people died in the tutorial box!

1332
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,440
Not me!

1333
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:43,240
Not me!

1334
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:44,440
Where do I go?

1335
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,320
Where did I came from?

1336
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,060
I got lost.

1337
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:49,640
Wait...

1338
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:50,300
Oh shit!

1339
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,160
There's two entrances!

1340
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:52,260
There's...

1341
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:55,600
She beat Soulja, got rigged the very first attempt!

1342
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:56,640
Could she...

1343
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,980
Okay, this is where I came from!

1344
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:00,560
I got a little sidetrack there!

1345
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:02,680
Wait...

1346
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:03,060
Oh wait!

1347
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:03,840
That's just nothing!

1348
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:04,540
Oh, that's...

1349
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:05,580
These are just like...

1350
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:07,620
When I looked in...

1351
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:09,320
Fortnite...

1352
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:09,920
Hole...

1353
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:10,940
Hole...

1354
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:13,660
Yes...

1355
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:14,420
Hole...

1356
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:15,540
Wait, how do I make my own?

1357
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:16,680
I wanna make my own!

1358
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:21,800
I wanna make my own little thingy...

1359
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,680
Do this...

1360
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:26,920
Classic...

1361
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:30,360
In menu?

1362
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:32,420
Oh, messages...

1363
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:34,340
Okay...

1364
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:36,820
Oh my god, okay...

1365
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:37,700
Messages...

1366
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:38,840
Template...

1367
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:40,280
Still...

1368
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,320
Uh...

1369
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:45,970
Let's see...

1370
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:47,790
I wanna say...

1371
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,820
What under...

1372
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:54,060
Oh my god...

1373
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:55,090
Okay, is there...

1374
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:55,820
Die...

1375
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,180
Situations...

1376
00:49:58,180 --> 00:49:59,260
Places...

1377
00:49:59,260 --> 00:49:59,780
Affinities...

1378
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:00,850
Concept...

1379
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:01,780
Death...

1380
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,660
Wait, I want more!

1381
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:05,300
Can I not have more...

1382
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:07,440
What the fuck is this?

1383
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:08,110
Okay...

1384
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:09,180
Death?

1385
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:09,500
Death...

1386
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,180
Ha ha ha ha ha...

1387
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:17,060
That's it...

1388
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:18,580
Death?

1389
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:24,960
Ha ha ha ha...

1390
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:25,440
That's it...

1391
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,580
There you go...

1392
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:27,980
We're gonna like this...

1393
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:37,940
That's good enough.

1394
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:40,300
That shows people that I'm a gamer.

1395
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:43,640
Didn't expect but I failed.

1396
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,320
Why did you fail this?

1397
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:46,040
Did you drop?

1398
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:50,560
Why did you die?

1399
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:54,000
Oh.

1400
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:58,620
Oh, okay, that makes sense.

1401
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:00,560
Oh, nice.

1402
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:00,980
Strength.

1403
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:02,380
Got strength.

1404
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:04,960
Okay.

1405
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:09,020
I hope me jumping down from here means I don't die.

1406
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:11,840
There we go.

1407
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,500
Okay, nice.

1408
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:14,480
We're good.

1409
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:19,580
Poor gravity.

1410
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:20,520
He got gravitated.

1411
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:25,670
He died in the tutorial hole.

1412
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:27,710
When there's a hole, there's a goal.

1413
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:29,090
Who could blame him?

1414
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:30,830
The hole was right there.

1415
00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:34,930
Alright.

1416
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:36,310
Touch.

1417
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:37,890
Yay!

1418
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:40,230
Okay, I need a heal.

1419
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:45,250
Pass time.

1420
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:46,190
Flask.

1421
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:46,830
What's this?

1422
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:48,730
Add charge to flask?

1423
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:52,790
Allocate flask charges?

1424
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:54,670
Oh!

1425
00:51:58,170 --> 00:51:59,290
Okay.

1426
00:51:59,290 --> 00:51:59,290
Okay.

1427
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:03,290
Do I add right now?

1428
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:05,810
Oh, that's my gold.

1429
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:06,130
Oh!

1430
00:52:06,430 --> 00:52:07,390
Can I just add it now?

1431
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:10,690
Use it?

1432
00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:13,430
Okay.

1433
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:15,850
Alright.

1434
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:20,350
Can I just keep adding it?

1435
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:26,170
Oh.

1436
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:27,410
Can I just keep doing it?

1437
00:52:29,950 --> 00:52:31,090
Oh, I only add one?

1438
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:32,510
God damn it.

1439
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:33,450
Alright.

1440
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:33,930
Alright.

1441
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:35,870
What's this?

1442
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:38,610
Use sacred tear to increase the amount?

1443
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:40,290
Do I have one?

1444
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:43,230
I don't even know if I have one.

1445
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:44,730
Okay, I'll put it all in healers.

1446
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:45,810
Yes.

1447
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:45,950
Yes.

1448
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:46,910
Alright.

1449
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:49,610
Alright.

1450
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:50,670
Uh... Leave.

1451
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:52,630
Alright, I should be good now.

1452
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:53,630
Wait, why is this?

1453
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:54,890
Why is there smokey air?

1454
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:56,490
Let me in!

1455
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:57,570
Let me in!

1456
00:52:57,570 --> 00:52:57,710
Oh my goodness.

1457
00:52:58,550 --> 00:52:59,870
Oh my goodness.

1458
00:53:01,290 --> 00:53:02,090
Suffering ahead?

1459
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:02,750
Why?

1460
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:03,530
Who's suffering?

1461
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:10,810
Use Tarnished World to write a golden summon.

1462
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:13,610
Cooperative members will begin once you have been summoned by a player.

1463
00:53:13,810 --> 00:53:17,370
You'll take the role of an ally and your objective is defeat the area boss.

1464
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:18,290
Oh.

1465
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:19,010
Okay.

1466
00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:22,170
Tarnished World finger.

1467
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:24,830
Oh, so there is the co-op.

1468
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:27,310
Very happy you finally played this game.

1469
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:29,910
Reminder that you owe us 11 story bosses.

1470
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:30,350
Oh!

1471
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:31,190
No, no, no!

1472
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:32,530
You can't gaslight me.

1473
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:33,190
It was five.

1474
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:34,790
That was neat.

1475
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:36,770
Thank you for the super chat.

1476
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:37,830
Thank you, thank you.

1477
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:39,570
You think I don't remember, do you?

1478
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:41,090
I knew it was five.

1479
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:48,730
Secret passage ahead?

1480
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:51,250
Where's the passage?

1481
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:53,370
Is he lying?

1482
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:54,730
Secret passage.

1483
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:56,910
Where's the other appraisal?

1484
00:54:04,850 --> 00:54:05,270
Alright.

1485
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,080
No, it's true.

1486
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:14,380
I just keep hitting it?

1487
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,020
Let me in!

1488
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:17,620
Let me in!

1489
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,300
Let me in!

1490
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:22,080
Let me in!

1491
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:23,640
Let me in!

1492
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:26,100
It said there's secret passages!

1493
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:27,900
Oh my god!

1494
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:29,620
I...

1495
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:31,160
Bad message!

1496
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:33,840
Poor!

1497
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:39,840
Oh, you guys paid 5-11?

1498
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,520
Oh my god, okay.

1499
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,340
I don't know you're gaslighting me.

1500
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:44,840
I...

1501
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,580
I don't know!

1502
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,380
I don't...

1503
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:48,800
No.

1504
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:50,360
Next scene.

1505
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:51,360
Thank you for the super chat.

1506
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,500
Thank you, thank you.

1507
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:53,260
Thank you.

1508
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,160
Then try...

1509
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:59,050
I'm not praising that message.

1510
00:54:59,710 --> 00:55:00,190
Poor!

1511
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:05,290
There we go.

1512
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:13,020
You gotta be...

1513
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:15,220
How dare you.

1514
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:19,360
I will fucking pour every message that lies to me.

1515
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:21,940
Be wary of enemy?

1516
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:23,380
Who's the enemy?

1517
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:28,820
Oh?

1518
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:30,180
Yeah!

1519
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:32,580
Yes!

1520
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:34,740
My message got a praise!

1521
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:35,560
Wait!

1522
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,440
Somebody found my message!

1523
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:38,820
Let's go!

1524
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:46,980
Let's fucking go!

1525
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:50,020
Someone liked my tweet, guys!

1526
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:51,800
I'm...

1527
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,200
Oh my god, I'm famous!

1528
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,700
I'm fucking famous, guys!

1529
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:57,000
My tweet got liked!

1530
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,520
My tweet got liked!

1531
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:00,950
Okay.

1532
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:02,290
Lost Grace Discovery.

1533
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:06,190
Exist to guide the tarnish and lead them along.

1534
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:10,410
Even now, some sites like Grace, their golden rays will guide you along the way.

1535
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:14,950
Use your map to check your, as well as Terran and surrounding structures.

1536
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:18,530
You can update your map with new information by finding map fragments.

1537
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:19,950
And use the map.

1538
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:20,310
Okay.

1539
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:22,010
Hello!

1540
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:24,830
Where did he die?

1541
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:28,130
Oh my god, next to the pretty...

1542
00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:29,010
...lady?

1543
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:29,530
Idiot!

1544
00:56:30,610 --> 00:56:31,030
Oh, mad!

1545
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:32,570
Tarnished, are we?

1546
00:56:33,050 --> 00:56:35,970
Come to the lands between for the Elden Ring?

1547
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:36,590
Hmm?

1548
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:38,350
Of course you have.

1549
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:40,190
No shame in it.

1550
00:56:40,890 --> 00:56:45,030
Unfortunately for you, however, you are maidenless.

1551
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:52,690
Without guidance, without the strength of runes, and without an invitation...

1552
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:52,890
What?

1553
00:56:54,130 --> 00:56:57,170
But there's so many maidens!

1554
00:56:57,170 --> 00:57:01,210
It seems to die in obscurity.

1555
00:57:01,850 --> 00:57:02,210
No!

1556
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:04,350
I can't die maidenless!

1557
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:06,570
They can't do this to me!

1558
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:10,950
They can't do this to me!

1559
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:17,010
Oh no, my job here is to get a maiden.

1560
00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:19,730
Before it's too late.

1561
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:23,450
Okay, what's over here?

1562
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:26,610
I don't know if there's anything here.

1563
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:26,950
Ooh!

1564
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:29,150
Can I kill those birds over there?

1565
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:31,190
Hello, little birds!

1566
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:35,810
I'm gonna let my anger out on you because I'm maidenless.

1567
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:37,310
Nice!

1568
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:38,710
Oh!

1569
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:40,450
Nice, I gotta...

1570
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:43,610
That's right, if I'm gonna be maidenless...

1571
00:57:44,810 --> 00:57:46,810
...I shall kill all birds.

1572
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:49,150
Get over here.

1573
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:51,110
That's right, I'm angry.

1574
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:52,550
Oh, hey, there's bones!

1575
00:57:53,330 --> 00:57:54,630
I got some bones, though!

1576
00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:56,690
Murder time!

1577
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:02,600
Why?

1578
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:04,640
What's the point?

1579
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:06,780
What's the point?

1580
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:09,280
You told me I have no women in my life.

1581
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:11,300
What's the point anymore?

1582
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:16,080
No, Duke, you have so much to live for!

1583
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,360
You don't need maidens!

1584
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:22,800
That's what people who have no maidens would say!

1585
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:24,960
Oh my god, I can't believe I missed.

1586
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:26,760
Might as well jump because of that.

1587
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:27,300
Alright.

1588
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:28,920
Don't do it!

1589
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:29,880
Do a flip!

1590
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:32,900
Do a flip!

1591
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:37,100
Alright.

1592
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,440
Let's see.

1593
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:39,260
Where do I go?

1594
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:41,460
There's a...

1595
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:42,260
There's a thing here.

1596
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:46,120
You may find effigies of martyrs.

1597
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,340
These are summoning pools.

1598
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:51,420
You'll find easy summons at these as co-ops and hostile summoning sites.

1599
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:54,580
Created with small effigies scattered at summoning pools.

1600
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:55,440
Oh, okay.

1601
00:58:59,200 --> 00:58:59,720
Okay.

1602
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:04,360
The summoning pool is now functional.

1603
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:05,640
What did I do?

1604
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:07,520
What is that?

1605
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:09,760
I mean, I know what it is, but...

1606
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:11,500
Try friend.

1607
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:12,220
Oh!

1608
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:14,460
Did someone come over?

1609
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,820
There's no one come- I am not fighting that!

1610
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:19,640
I know I lose!

1611
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:27,960
I know I lose!

1612
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:30,620
I might not have done my research, but...

1613
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:32,980
Elder Ring fans, you don't need it...

1614
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:38,120
You don't have to look far for Elder Ring fans to spam your timeline about this guy.

1615
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,120
I am...

1616
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:40,250
I am...

1617
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:44,460
This tradition...

1618
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:45,760
Not for me!

1619
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:48,120
I shall bring tradition!

1620
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:49,720
I...

1621
00:59:50,610 --> 00:59:53,260
Can't get me if I'm crouched!

1622
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:54,700
I am...

1623
00:59:55,120 --> 01:00:23,240
I am...

1624
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:27,580
I think it's particularly hot that I have zero deaths right now.

1625
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:31,220
Uh... Thank you for the super chat.

1626
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:31,920
Thank you.

1627
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:32,860
Thank you.

1628
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:41,020
You guys are saying cowards because you all died to him too.

1629
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:42,880
So you want me to join.

1630
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:47,140
You just... you just want me to be just like you.

1631
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:50,120
Dying first try at this guy.

1632
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:52,260
I know you never beat him.

1633
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:55,320
Until, like, when you're 30 plus levels.

1634
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,840
He's not even an actual boss!

1635
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:05,560
No head ahead.

1636
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:07,480
Oh, hey, I'm at a church now.

1637
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:08,840
Let's go.

1638
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,840
It's a right one of us.

1639
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,340
One of us.

1640
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:16,140
I miss the travel to any sites of grace that you discovered.

1641
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:20,220
How there's some dungeons and other areas where this cannot be done.

1642
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:23,580
Zero deaths equals zero made.

1643
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,000
No food, thank you but...

1644
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:26,980
But I'm alive!

1645
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:30,340
Yes, there's a guy that died to him!

1646
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:33,580
Yay!

1647
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:35,520
My message got outvoted.

1648
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:36,080
You know what?

1649
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:37,020
Fuck you guys.

1650
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:40,380
Let me... make a message.

1651
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:41,680
Um...

1652
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:46,840
Um...

1653
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:47,400
Let's see.

1654
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:51,780
All right.

1655
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:54,460
Let's see.

1656
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:55,360
What do I want?

1657
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:59,580
What do I want?

1658
01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:03,990
Let's see.

1659
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:35,340
Let's see.

1660
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:35,380
Victory.

1661
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,560
Oh, he's here to...

1662
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:44,680
I can buy stuff from him.

1663
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,360
Wait, what's wrong with his donkey?

1664
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:48,580
Purchase about Kale.

1665
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:53,580
He's gonna give it up for her rating.

1666
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:53,860
He's gonna give it up for her rating.

1667
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:56,620
He has been tainted by madness since the shattering of...

1668
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:57,200
He's Santa?

1669
01:02:58,220 --> 01:03:00,280
It's only tarnished, like yourself.

1670
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:03,360
Who keep things from drying up entirely.

1671
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:06,420
Let's say you're a very welcome customer.

1672
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:07,080
What?

1673
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,560
What's his recommendation?

1674
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:13,960
If you can spare the rooms, you should buy yourself a crafting kit.

1675
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:14,560
Oh?

1676
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,800
The crafting kit allows you to make...

1677
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:17,080
Yay!

1678
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:18,520
Message was liked.

1679
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:20,040
Essential, really.

1680
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:23,140
If you intend to survive out here for any duration.

1681
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:25,180
The kit costs a bundle.

1682
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:27,620
And I admit, I do take my cut.

1683
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:30,700
But the important thing is that you survive.

1684
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:33,160
Every customer counts.

1685
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:34,460
After all.

1686
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:35,600
Okay.

1687
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:37,660
Can I afford it?

1688
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:40,180
You can spend runes to purchase various...

1689
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:42,020
You can also sell items for runes.

1690
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:44,880
Is there anything I should buy?

1691
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:47,380
Right now?

1692
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:50,580
Cracked pot.

1693
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:53,840
Crafting?

1694
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:54,460
This one?

1695
01:03:55,660 --> 01:03:57,840
Crafting, cracked pot items.

1696
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:03,000
Reveals co-op and hostile summoning signs.

1697
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:04,300
Top right.

1698
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:05,020
Oh, crafting kit.

1699
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:05,680
There it is.

1700
01:04:06,460 --> 01:04:06,840
All right.

1701
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:08,600
Nice.

1702
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:09,700
Okay.

1703
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,640
How do I use this crafting kit though?

1704
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:15,720
I'm glad you took my warning to heart.

1705
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:18,100
You've made an excellent choice.

1706
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:20,700
Yeah.

1707
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,900
You can make various items for materials I find.

1708
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:24,360
Item crafting from...

1709
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:25,620
You can learn to craft by finding...

1710
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:26,960
Cookbooks.

1711
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:27,500
Oh!

1712
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:28,500
I can start cooking!

1713
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,560
Cannot be able to make more than you have.

1714
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,520
Items will run with...

1715
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:34,000
Outward use.

1716
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,720
But canary cells will remain.

1717
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:36,760
Oh, okay.

1718
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:39,500
Item crafting.

1719
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:40,940
What can I make?

1720
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:43,860
You can learn to craft by...

1721
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:45,540
More items by finding...

1722
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:46,180
Oh!

1723
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:46,740
Okay.

1724
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:48,960
So currently I can find...

1725
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:49,620
Craft...

1726
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:50,960
Feed to...

1727
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:52,880
Torrent to restore HP.

1728
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:55,040
Who the fuck is Torrent?

1729
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:56,760
I need to use the bathroom.

1730
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:57,620
I'll be right back, guys.

1731
01:06:54,890 --> 01:06:55,430
All right.

1732
01:06:55,630 --> 01:06:56,430
I'm back.

1733
01:06:57,230 --> 01:06:57,950
Uh, Solid.

1734
01:06:58,170 --> 01:06:59,190
Hey, Affiliant.

1735
01:06:59,370 --> 01:07:00,790
Laffy, thank you for the super chat.

01:07:00,910 --> 01:07:01,090

1737
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:01,670
Thank you.

1738
01:07:01,890 --> 01:07:03,250
Devil, thank you for the super chat.

1739
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:03,530
Thank you.

01:07:03,670 --> 01:07:04,150
Thank you.

1741
01:07:04,470 --> 01:07:04,930
Hot tip.

1742
01:07:05,030 --> 01:07:05,830
Messages on the ground.

1743
01:07:05,930 --> 01:07:06,870

1744
01:07:07,050 --> 01:07:07,910
So chat can be your...

1745
01:07:07,910 --> 01:07:08,110
Wait.

1746
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:09,030
Is that true?

1747
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:11,270
That's an actual strat?

1748
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:11,970
Wait.

1749
01:07:12,030 --> 01:07:13,030
That's fucking broken.

1750
01:07:14,390 --> 01:07:14,970
Wait.

1751
01:07:14,970 --> 01:07:16,910
That's actually so broken.

1752
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:20,090
Uh...

1753
01:07:20,090 --> 01:07:20,510
Subaru, thank you.

1754
01:07:20,730 --> 01:07:21,870
Welcome to tomato farm.

1755
01:07:21,990 --> 01:07:22,650
Welcome, welcome.

1756
01:07:22,970 --> 01:07:23,110
Wait.

1757
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:24,270
That's actually...

1758
01:07:24,270 --> 01:07:24,830
Really?

1759
01:07:25,130 --> 01:07:25,630
Oh my god.

1760
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:26,790
I should just leave messages everywhere.

1761
01:07:27,150 --> 01:07:28,450
What if I'm like...

1762
01:07:28,450 --> 01:07:29,810
At a boss fight...

1763
01:07:29,810 --> 01:07:31,210
And I just leave like...

1764
01:07:31,210 --> 01:07:32,750
10 messages...

1765
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:33,510
At the boss...

1766
01:07:37,870 --> 01:07:39,310
I just leave...

1767
01:07:39,310 --> 01:07:40,570
I just leave like...

1768
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:41,250
10 messages...

1769
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:42,550
At the boss area.

1770
01:07:43,150 --> 01:07:44,670
And SMC's like...

1771
01:07:44,670 --> 01:07:44,810
Yeah.

1772
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:46,470
Bro, that's pain...

1773
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:47,690
That's stream to win.

1774
01:07:48,310 --> 01:07:48,750
Okay.

1775
01:07:48,950 --> 01:07:49,090
Wait.

1776
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:51,410
That's actually...

1777
01:07:51,410 --> 01:07:53,490
That's stream to win.

1778
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:54,510
Alright.

1779
01:07:54,710 --> 01:07:55,090
Let's see.

1780
01:07:56,570 --> 01:07:57,290
Um...

1781
01:07:57,290 --> 01:07:58,290
I want to see I can find...

1782
01:07:59,010 --> 01:08:00,230
Is there like...

1783
01:08:02,590 --> 01:08:05,410
I can find something.

1784
01:08:06,870 --> 01:08:07,470
Incantation...

1785
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:08,770
Flask...

1786
01:08:08,770 --> 01:08:09,350
I need like...

1787
01:08:09,350 --> 01:08:10,390
Where's the flask one?

1788
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:11,550
Is there...

1789
01:08:11,550 --> 01:08:12,990
Is there like...

1790
01:08:12,990 --> 01:08:14,370
Is there a flask?

1791
01:08:14,670 --> 01:08:15,010
Okay.

1792
01:08:15,150 --> 01:08:16,130
Is there a flask?

1793
01:08:16,810 --> 01:08:17,310
Word?

1794
01:08:19,290 --> 01:08:19,890
No.

1795
01:08:20,170 --> 01:08:21,210
Stop that.

1796
01:08:21,510 --> 01:08:21,870
No.

1797
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:23,050
It's not cheating.

1798
01:08:23,490 --> 01:08:25,530
I'm just trying to warn people.

1799
01:08:25,990 --> 01:08:26,310
Guys.

1800
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:27,350
I...

1801
01:08:28,030 --> 01:08:28,910
Is there...

1802
01:08:28,910 --> 01:08:29,930
I need healing.

1803
01:08:30,230 --> 01:08:31,510
Where's...

1804
01:08:31,510 --> 01:08:32,810
I need...

1805
01:08:32,810 --> 01:08:34,590
I need healing.

1806
01:08:35,730 --> 01:08:37,010
Do it.

1807
01:08:37,950 --> 01:08:38,790
Alright.

1808
01:08:39,570 --> 01:08:40,090
I...

1809
01:08:40,090 --> 01:08:41,890
I want to go home.

1810
01:08:42,110 --> 01:08:42,350
Same.

1811
01:08:42,970 --> 01:08:43,410
Same.

1812
01:08:44,150 --> 01:08:44,490
Wait.

1813
01:08:44,630 --> 01:08:45,490
Actions has healing.

1814
01:08:46,390 --> 01:08:47,810
Surcery summoning.

1815
01:08:48,010 --> 01:08:48,290
Healing.

1816
01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:50,790
Alright guys.

1817
01:08:51,470 --> 01:08:52,630
Stand near this one.

1818
01:08:53,490 --> 01:08:56,050
Just stand near this one.

1819
01:08:56,670 --> 01:08:58,430
If you want to heal me.

1820
01:08:58,430 --> 01:08:59,810
Just stand here.

1821
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:01,270
And keep up voting.

1822
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:03,430
Just give me up dudes here.

1823
01:09:03,930 --> 01:09:05,470
This is my reddit post.

1824
01:09:12,730 --> 01:09:13,250
Um...

1825
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:17,030
You can spend runes and smithing stones to train your armaments.

1826
01:09:17,310 --> 01:09:18,490
Somewhere in the lands between you and me.

1827
01:09:18,550 --> 01:09:20,870
A blacksmith who can make your armaments even stronger.

1828
01:09:23,270 --> 01:09:23,950
Um...

1829
01:09:23,950 --> 01:09:24,330
Oh, okay.

1830
01:09:24,710 --> 01:09:25,490
Let me fix that.

1831
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:27,010
Oh.

1832
01:09:27,810 --> 01:09:28,490
Voice.

1833
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:30,390
Voice up by...

1834
01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:31,310
Up to ten.

1835
01:09:31,670 --> 01:09:32,310
Music.

1836
01:09:32,670 --> 01:09:34,410
Down by one.

1837
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:37,050
And then overall volume up.

1838
01:09:37,270 --> 01:09:37,430
Alright.

1839
01:09:37,470 --> 01:09:38,010
I got you.

1840
01:09:38,690 --> 01:09:39,810
I got you.

1841
01:09:41,370 --> 01:09:42,050
Alright.

1842
01:09:42,110 --> 01:09:43,090
Let me know this is better.

1843
01:09:45,730 --> 01:09:46,130
Alright.

1844
01:09:47,710 --> 01:09:48,330
Oh my god.

1845
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:49,710
I keep accidentally tabbing out.

1846
01:09:49,790 --> 01:09:51,090
And I feel like my game is going to crash.

1847
01:09:51,610 --> 01:09:51,970
I...

1848
01:09:51,970 --> 01:09:53,250
Where do I go?

1849
01:09:53,570 --> 01:09:54,050
Oh, here.

1850
01:09:54,910 --> 01:09:55,790
Wait, where do I go?

1851
01:09:59,310 --> 01:09:59,970
Oh no.

1852
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:03,210
You can check the current terrain buildings.

1853
01:10:03,450 --> 01:10:06,710
You can also freely place beacons of light to serve as landmarks.

1854
01:10:06,710 --> 01:10:12,030
Lastly though, through your map you can select any site of grace I've discovered.

1855
01:10:12,450 --> 01:10:15,270
However, there are some dungeons and other areas where this cannot be.

1856
01:10:15,370 --> 01:10:16,150
Where am I?

1857
01:10:17,030 --> 01:10:18,010
Oh my god.

1858
01:10:18,730 --> 01:10:19,730
Is this me?

1859
01:10:20,270 --> 01:10:20,790
No.

1860
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:21,790
This is me.

1861
01:10:22,990 --> 01:10:23,810
Oh my god.

1862
01:10:23,830 --> 01:10:25,090
I'm already so confused.

1863
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:26,830
Too much information.

1864
01:10:27,970 --> 01:10:30,270
Wherever the wind takes you.

1865
01:10:30,710 --> 01:10:31,830
Oh my god.

1866
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:33,670
Hero.

1867
01:10:33,850 --> 01:10:35,150
Thank you for five gift of ships.

1868
01:10:35,310 --> 01:10:35,590
Thank you.

1869
01:10:35,730 --> 01:10:36,290
Thank you.

1870
01:10:36,710 --> 01:10:38,730
Okay, I can figure this out.

1871
01:10:39,370 --> 01:10:41,390
I should get that real quick.

1872
01:10:42,410 --> 01:10:43,870
Am I even strengthening anything?

1873
01:10:45,970 --> 01:10:47,170
I need money.

1874
01:10:47,530 --> 01:10:48,290
No money.

1875
01:10:48,530 --> 01:10:50,050
Oh, someone said I should buy a torch.

1876
01:10:50,370 --> 01:10:50,730
Okay.

1877
01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:52,070
I'll buy that.

1878
01:10:55,530 --> 01:10:56,250
Purchase...

1879
01:10:56,250 --> 01:10:57,150
Torch.

1880
01:10:59,310 --> 01:11:00,030
Okay.

1881
01:11:00,930 --> 01:11:01,470
Goodbye.

1882
01:11:04,470 --> 01:11:05,190
Yay!

1883
01:11:07,090 --> 01:11:07,870
Go north?

1884
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:08,110
Go north?

1885
01:11:08,110 --> 01:11:08,430
Where's north?

1886
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:09,310
Oh, this way.

1887
01:11:09,550 --> 01:11:09,770
Okay.

1888
01:11:11,050 --> 01:11:11,990
I'll go north.

1889
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:17,020
There's no yellow line.

1890
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:17,840
Anywhere.

1891
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:20,140
Oh no, there is one.

1892
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:21,940
Where's the yellow line pointing me?

1893
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:25,480
Where are you taking me, my yellow line?

1894
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:28,140
Oh, never mind.

1895
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:28,720
Nowhere.

1896
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:30,200
My yellow line disappeared.

1897
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:30,420
Here.

1898
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:33,400
Ethan, thank you for the five gift of chips.

1899
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:33,880
Thank you.

1900
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:34,700
Thank you.

1901
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:36,240
North east here?

1902
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:38,840
Oh my god.

1903
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:40,800
What's this?

1904
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:42,260
Seek tarnish.

1905
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:44,200
Oh wait.

1906
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:44,780
These guys.

1907
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:48,340
First off, target lock.

1908
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:49,120
Oh my god.

1909
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:49,900
He's teaching me how to play.

1910
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:51,620
I don't think he saw me.

1911
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:12,320
Oh fuck, I still missed!

1912
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:16,100
I won the fight.

1913
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:18,780
I don't know the range.

1914
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:20,860
Guys, I don't know the range.

1915
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:22,720
I don't know.

1916
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:26,120
I don't know the range!

1917
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,360
It's my first time!

1918
01:12:29,620 --> 01:12:32,200
It worked in the end.

1919
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:34,320
It still worked.

1920
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,560
It still worked.

1921
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,100
That's all that matters.

1922
01:12:40,820 --> 01:12:42,660
There's like some deers.

1923
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:46,600
Wait, I heard some glowing stuff.

1924
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:49,680
It still worked!

1925
01:12:55,940 --> 01:12:57,100
He doesn't know.

1926
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:00,800
Stupid.

1927
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:04,060
Nice.

1928
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:05,240
I got some fruits too.

1929
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:07,200
What is that sound?

1930
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:08,280
You guys hear that?

1931
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:10,740
Chemical, thank you for the super chat.

1932
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:12,620
Thank you for the five gift of chips.

1933
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:13,460
Thank you, thank you.

1934
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:14,300
Oh, is it this?

1935
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:15,320
What is this?

1936
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:18,380
What is that?

1937
01:13:18,860 --> 01:13:19,860
I'm gonna break it.

1938
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:23,160
What are you?

1939
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:27,770
Defeat them.

1940
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:28,230
Oh!

1941
01:13:29,570 --> 01:13:30,450
They replant.

1942
01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:30,870
Oh!

1943
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:32,390
That's fucking right.

1944
01:13:32,730 --> 01:13:33,190
Yoink.

1945
01:13:34,470 --> 01:13:36,330
Oh, it refills my flask.

1946
01:13:36,490 --> 01:13:37,050
Oh my god.

1947
01:13:37,210 --> 01:13:38,070
Why does that lag?

1948
01:13:38,430 --> 01:13:39,150
That's crazy.

1949
01:13:40,010 --> 01:13:40,670
Wait, materials.

1950
01:13:43,010 --> 01:13:43,570
Alright.

1951
01:13:44,490 --> 01:13:45,050
Absolute.

1952
01:13:45,090 --> 01:13:45,830
Thank you for the super chat.

1953
01:13:45,830 --> 01:13:48,830
I think you think most focused guard on the game.

1954
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:51,230
This is where I can get res.

1955
01:13:54,670 --> 01:13:55,370
Uh...

1956
01:13:55,370 --> 01:13:56,210
Oh?

1957
01:13:57,130 --> 01:13:58,570
First off, life.

1958
01:13:59,790 --> 01:14:00,890
What's that mean?

1959
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:03,790
Is he bad?

1960
01:14:04,330 --> 01:14:06,170
You think that's a bad person?

1961
01:14:09,230 --> 01:14:10,250
I can't tell.

1962
01:14:13,110 --> 01:14:14,410
There's a bonfire?

1963
01:14:14,790 --> 01:14:15,690
Oh, is it over there?

1964
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:18,630
I think that's the bonfire, right?

1965
01:14:18,970 --> 01:14:19,830
Oh, it is.

1966
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:21,170
Alright.

1967
01:14:23,590 --> 01:14:24,410
I'm going.

1968
01:14:25,230 --> 01:14:26,730
Zero, thank you for the super chat.

1969
01:14:26,730 --> 01:14:27,190
Thank you.

1970
01:14:27,350 --> 01:14:27,890
Thank you.

1971
01:14:27,890 --> 01:14:28,050
Thank you.

1972
01:14:28,550 --> 01:14:30,550
Told you Sekiro will be your...

1973
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:32,830
Will be a training montage.

1974
01:14:37,570 --> 01:14:39,590
Is it even worth fighting these guys?

1975
01:14:41,330 --> 01:14:42,370
Seek rump.

1976
01:14:42,630 --> 01:14:43,690
Oh, seek buff.

1977
01:14:45,910 --> 01:14:47,870
I don't need a rest, to be fair.

1978
01:14:50,390 --> 01:14:51,630
Oh, set the fire?

1979
01:14:51,630 --> 01:14:52,010
Okay.

1980
01:14:57,410 --> 01:14:57,890
Oh.

1981
01:14:58,170 --> 01:14:58,750
Oh, plot!

1982
01:14:59,890 --> 01:15:01,430
I was going to say, I was full HP.

1983
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:02,910
Why would I need a...

1984
01:15:02,910 --> 01:15:04,130
Why would I need a set of the fire?

1985
01:15:06,290 --> 01:15:07,630
Which wife is this one?

1986
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:09,290
See, I told you I'm not maidenless.

1987
01:15:09,650 --> 01:15:10,670
She came to me.

1988
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:12,510
I did not seek her out.

1989
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:17,980
Hello.

1990
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:21,700
He telling my friends that I have a girlfriend?

1991
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:23,180
Right in...

1992
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:24,020
In this game?

1993
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:25,780
People don't believe me.

1994
01:15:28,220 --> 01:15:31,620
I tell people you live in Canada, and they all laugh.

1995
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:36,660
I feel this thing.

1996
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:45,180
I offer you an accord.

1997
01:15:46,940 --> 01:15:48,680
Oh, what's wrong with your eye?

1998
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:53,660
Have you heard of the finger major?

1999
01:15:53,660 --> 01:15:55,080
She goes to another school.

2000
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:58,100
Two fingers.

2001
01:15:58,980 --> 01:16:00,440
Offering guidance.

2002
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:02,020
And aid.

2003
01:16:02,540 --> 01:16:03,840
To the tarnished.

2004
01:16:06,540 --> 01:16:07,860
You're saying I'm ma...

2005
01:16:07,860 --> 01:16:08,720
No!

2006
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:10,320
What?

2007
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:13,320
You mean we're not official?

2008
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:14,560
But...

2009
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:17,340
I thought we were dating!

2010
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:20,460
Turning rooms into strength.

2011
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:23,540
You mean we were just friends?

2012
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:33,040
You need only take me with you to the foot of the earth.

2013
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:33,780
Oh, no.

2014
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:36,440
She thought we were just friends.

2015
01:16:36,620 --> 01:16:37,240
Do I accept her?

2016
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:38,460
She rejected me.

2017
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:39,660
I should refuse, right?

2018
01:16:41,460 --> 01:16:41,980
Right.

2019
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:43,040
Made it.

2020
01:16:51,710 --> 01:16:53,770
Accept her accord.

2021
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:56,330
Okay, I'll accept.

2022
01:16:56,670 --> 01:16:56,790
And settled.

2023
01:16:57,530 --> 01:16:59,550
Summon me by grace.

2024
01:17:00,190 --> 01:17:02,270
To turn runes into strength.

2025
01:17:02,270 --> 01:17:02,670
Oh!

2026
01:17:04,130 --> 01:17:05,710
She helps me level up.

2027
01:17:07,910 --> 01:17:09,850
Oh, we're friends with benefits.

2028
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:11,990
That's what it is, right?

2029
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:16,530
Spectral steed whistle.

2030
01:17:16,770 --> 01:17:18,130
Oh, I have a horse now.

2031
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:19,070
To traverse great distances.

2032
01:17:21,130 --> 01:17:23,110
It will summon a spectral steed.

2033
01:17:23,850 --> 01:17:25,050
Named Torrent.

2034
01:17:26,930 --> 01:17:28,590
Torrent has chosen you.

2035
01:17:30,090 --> 01:17:31,290
Now, I have a Honda.

2036
01:17:31,710 --> 01:17:32,510
Treat him with respect.

2037
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:36,950
Uh...

2038
01:17:36,950 --> 01:17:37,590
She had a level up?

2039
01:17:37,710 --> 01:17:39,190
Should I turn your runes to strength?

2040
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:42,070
Let my hand rest upon you.

2041
01:17:42,170 --> 01:17:42,470
Oh!

2042
01:17:43,050 --> 01:17:44,570
We're touching my hands.

2043
01:17:45,030 --> 01:17:46,050
Oh my god.

2044
01:17:46,730 --> 01:17:49,870
With the level up menu, you can spend runes to increase your attributes.

2045
01:17:50,410 --> 01:17:51,590
Oh my god.

2046
01:17:52,090 --> 01:17:53,150
I'm too weak.

2047
01:17:54,210 --> 01:17:56,250
I need a 811.

2048
01:17:56,650 --> 01:17:57,250
Oh my god.

2049
01:17:57,410 --> 01:17:58,330
We're holding hands.

2050
01:17:58,330 --> 01:17:58,690
Guys.

2051
01:17:59,290 --> 01:18:00,430
Oh my gosh.

2052
01:18:00,910 --> 01:18:02,190
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

2053
01:18:04,190 --> 01:18:06,530
And she said we're just friends.

2054
01:18:07,110 --> 01:18:09,670
I refuse to believe it now.

2055
01:18:12,550 --> 01:18:13,130
Um...

2056
01:18:13,130 --> 01:18:13,570
Miss up.

2057
01:18:13,690 --> 01:18:15,290
But it will cost one flask.

2058
01:18:15,430 --> 01:18:15,570
Oh!

2059
01:18:15,650 --> 01:18:16,390
She can die?

2060
01:18:18,870 --> 01:18:20,750
Using order by pressing C.

2061
01:18:22,750 --> 01:18:24,610
Use items in pouch.

2062
01:18:24,850 --> 01:18:27,850
Four of these items can be used without opening the main menu.

2063
01:18:27,850 --> 01:18:32,030
On pouch, you can equip six items to your pouches.

2064
01:18:33,390 --> 01:18:34,270
Be up.

2065
01:18:34,930 --> 01:18:35,230
Okay.

2066
01:18:35,430 --> 01:18:36,890
We're not doing that.

2067
01:18:37,210 --> 01:18:37,450
Okay.

2068
01:18:37,490 --> 01:18:38,510
We're rebinding that.

2069
01:18:42,330 --> 01:18:46,230
We're definitely rebinding those items.

2070
01:18:47,110 --> 01:18:47,410
All right.

2071
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:49,510
Rebindings.

2072
01:18:50,690 --> 01:18:51,350
Okay.

2073
01:18:52,010 --> 01:18:52,730
Switch items.

2074
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:54,430
Switch incantation.

2075
01:18:55,750 --> 01:18:56,490
Uh...

2076
01:18:56,490 --> 01:18:58,120
Where was the fucking thing that...

2077
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:02,010
Wait.

2078
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:02,750
Was that it?

2079
01:19:03,690 --> 01:19:04,830
Use item.

2080
01:19:05,090 --> 01:19:05,310
All right.

2081
01:19:05,430 --> 01:19:06,060
Where's my...

2082
01:19:06,670 --> 01:19:07,810
Where's the thing?

2083
01:19:09,510 --> 01:19:10,390
E up.

2084
01:19:10,630 --> 01:19:11,310
E switch.

2085
01:19:11,950 --> 01:19:12,630
Where's...

2086
01:19:12,630 --> 01:19:14,550
Where's the thing?

2087
01:19:16,870 --> 01:19:17,470
Equipment.

2088
01:19:18,210 --> 01:19:18,810
Equipment?

2089
01:19:20,090 --> 01:19:21,930
I wanna put my...

2090
01:19:21,930 --> 01:19:23,630
Put the horsey thing.

2091
01:19:24,370 --> 01:19:25,850
It's for the pouch?

2092
01:19:26,090 --> 01:19:27,610
Where the fuck is my pouch?

2093
01:19:29,510 --> 01:19:30,430
Oh, there you go.

2094
01:19:30,530 --> 01:19:31,050
Inventory.

2095
01:19:32,190 --> 01:19:34,250
You can browse items or drop them.

2096
01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:34,530
Okay.

2097
01:19:34,590 --> 01:19:35,170
There you go.

2098
01:19:36,050 --> 01:19:38,150
Mail display the tab with it.

2099
01:19:39,110 --> 01:19:39,710
Uh...

2100
01:19:39,710 --> 01:19:41,290
Itemstained can be marked with this.

2101
01:19:41,470 --> 01:19:41,610
Okay.

2102
01:19:44,870 --> 01:19:45,830
Information about...

2103
01:19:45,830 --> 01:19:45,970
Okay.

2104
01:19:46,050 --> 01:19:46,510
There you go.

2105
01:19:49,170 --> 01:19:49,650
Wait.

2106
01:19:51,690 --> 01:19:52,170
Yeah.

2107
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:01,870
Oh, there it is.

2108
01:20:01,990 --> 01:20:02,390
Sorry.

2109
01:20:02,930 --> 01:20:03,590
A little special.

2110
01:20:05,350 --> 01:20:06,270
It's like...

2111
01:20:06,270 --> 01:20:07,330
I'm so confused.

2112
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:08,650
Switch.

2113
01:20:08,930 --> 01:20:09,050
Okay.

2114
01:20:09,130 --> 01:20:09,710
There we go.

2115
01:20:10,570 --> 01:20:11,130
There we go.

2116
01:20:11,290 --> 01:20:12,110
I was like...

2117
01:20:12,110 --> 01:20:12,890
Right side.

2118
01:20:13,250 --> 01:20:14,370
I know my left.

2119
01:20:14,370 --> 01:20:14,890
Left and right.

2120
01:20:16,170 --> 01:20:16,850
There...

2121
01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:17,470
There I go.

2122
01:20:18,370 --> 01:20:19,650
Don't worry, guys.

2123
01:20:19,670 --> 01:20:21,490
I know my left and right.

2124
01:20:24,190 --> 01:20:27,530
I said I was so fucking confused.

2125
01:20:31,250 --> 01:20:31,930
Yeah.

2126
01:20:33,230 --> 01:20:34,210
Oh, my God.

2127
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:39,530
This is a little awkward.

2128
01:20:39,530 --> 01:20:41,870
Because I can't rebind the other thing.

2129
01:20:42,290 --> 01:20:42,690
I...

2130
01:20:45,030 --> 01:20:45,550
Okay.

2131
01:20:45,870 --> 01:20:45,970
Wait.

2132
01:20:46,090 --> 01:20:46,790
I figured it out.

2133
01:20:47,750 --> 01:20:48,270
Okay.

2134
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:49,550
If I do E...

2135
01:20:49,550 --> 01:20:50,630
And then...

2136
01:20:52,330 --> 01:20:52,850
Okay.

2137
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:53,390
There we go.

2138
01:20:55,330 --> 01:20:56,130
There we go.

2139
01:20:57,070 --> 01:20:57,690
Oh, okay.

2140
01:20:57,730 --> 01:20:58,690
There's the double jump.

2141
01:20:59,870 --> 01:21:00,390
Okay.

2142
01:21:00,410 --> 01:21:01,070
There it is.

2143
01:21:02,110 --> 01:21:02,510
All right.

2144
01:21:02,830 --> 01:21:03,490
There's that.

2145
01:21:04,130 --> 01:21:04,630
No.

2146
01:21:04,690 --> 01:21:05,930
I figured it out, guys.

2147
01:21:06,190 --> 01:21:06,630
And then...

2148
01:21:07,210 --> 01:21:07,790
There we go.

2149
01:21:09,330 --> 01:21:10,790
What's the top part?

2150
01:21:13,270 --> 01:21:14,530
What's the top part?

2151
01:21:14,690 --> 01:21:15,250
What's the grace?

2152
01:21:16,410 --> 01:21:16,930
All right.

2153
01:21:17,370 --> 01:21:18,430
I think I can farm these guys.

2154
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:26,380
What's he gonna do?

2155
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:26,960
Kill me?

2156
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:28,280
That's...

2157
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:29,680
That's fucking right.

2158
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,080
I kill you first.

2159
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:32,040
Oh, wait.

2160
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:32,560
I need that.

2161
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:33,460
Oh, cool.

2162
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:34,080
I got a helmet.

2163
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:37,680
I got a helmet.

2164
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:37,980
I got a helmet for it.

2165
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:38,260
Okay.

2166
01:21:39,260 --> 01:21:41,080
I was like a little confused what that was.

2167
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:43,720
All right.

2168
01:21:46,940 --> 01:21:48,020
Don't worry, guys.

2169
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:50,600
I'm barely understanding my own controls.

2170
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:51,660
Oh, he's...

2171
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:52,700
That guy blows a horn.

2172
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:55,140
Can't blow the horn if I kill him first.

2173
01:21:57,860 --> 01:21:59,280
No horn blowing for you.

2174
01:21:59,500 --> 01:21:59,860
Don't worry.

2175
01:22:00,140 --> 01:22:01,080
He doesn't know.

2176
01:22:04,890 --> 01:22:06,550
Do you think he knows?

2177
01:22:14,860 --> 01:22:17,060
I told you he doesn't know.

2178
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:17,860
I...

2179
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:23,100
I told you, guys.

2180
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:26,080
What was the...

2181
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,240
Just the wind.

2182
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:30,620
That's right.

2183
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:31,740
It was me.

2184
01:22:32,060 --> 01:22:32,720
The wind.

2185
01:22:36,620 --> 01:22:37,460
Oh, nice.

2186
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:38,320
Oh, shit.

2187
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:39,380
He doesn't know either.

2188
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:45,760
Hello.

2189
01:22:50,590 --> 01:22:51,390
That's fucking right.

2190
01:22:51,510 --> 01:22:52,150
Got your knees.

2191
01:22:56,150 --> 01:22:58,770
Damn, that's a strong fucking wind right there.

2192
01:23:00,930 --> 01:23:01,530
Oh, wait.

2193
01:23:01,570 --> 01:23:02,950
I think that guy must be really strong.

2194
01:23:03,790 --> 01:23:05,350
He has, like, all the armor.

2195
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:09,300
All right.

2196
01:23:11,060 --> 01:23:14,420
Please press car 1 closer.

2197
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:19,400
Please, Toki.

2198
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:21,280
That's all we ask you.

2199
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:24,240
Just go a little closer.

2200
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:30,640
You mean left click.

2201
01:23:31,660 --> 01:23:33,660
What key is that?

2202
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:49,400
Oh, shit.

2203
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:50,600
Oh, shit.

2204
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:50,660
Oh, shit.

2205
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:51,040
Wait.

2206
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:51,780
Wait a minute.

2207
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:53,020
Wait a minute.

2208
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:53,860
Wait.

2209
01:23:53,860 --> 01:23:55,000
There's two of you.

2210
01:23:55,420 --> 01:23:57,680
But what if there was...

2211
01:23:57,680 --> 01:23:58,300
Oh, yes.

2212
01:23:58,520 --> 01:23:58,680
Nice.

2213
01:23:58,840 --> 01:23:58,940
Nice.

2214
01:23:58,940 --> 01:23:59,360
Guys, okay.

2215
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:01,060
I don't think he...

2216
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:01,400
Guys.

2217
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:02,460
How did he go?

2218
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:03,220
Oh, shit.

2219
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:03,960
Oh, fuck.

2220
01:24:04,220 --> 01:24:05,180
How did he know?

2221
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:07,040
How did he know?

2222
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:07,860
Oh.

2223
01:24:07,860 --> 01:24:09,660
Guys, appraise the message.

2224
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:11,040
Appraise the message.

2225
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:12,160
Appraise it.

2226
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:14,020
Signed appraising.

2227
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:15,400
They said...

2228
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:17,120
I have so many messages.

2229
01:24:17,860 --> 01:24:18,760
Appraise...

2230
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,320
Guys, I have so many.

2231
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:28,160
I have so many.

2232
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:28,620
I have so many.

2233
01:24:28,620 --> 01:24:29,100
I have so many.

2234
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,820
Just one appraise.

2235
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:33,740
Oh, I forgot.

2236
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:38,020
I don't remember how to use the flask.

2237
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:39,240
Oh, my God.

2238
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:40,480
What button is that?

2239
01:24:42,060 --> 01:24:43,600
What button is that?

2240
01:24:44,180 --> 01:24:44,780
I...

2241
01:24:44,780 --> 01:24:45,200
Alright.

2242
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:46,480
Okay, I'm back.

2243
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:48,240
There we go.

2244
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:49,160
There we go.

2245
01:24:49,260 --> 01:24:49,920
I figured it out.

2246
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:50,940
Okay.

2247
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:53,140
Oh, my God.

2248
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:55,300
Guys.

2249
01:24:55,620 --> 01:24:56,800
Why couldn't you appraise?

2250
01:25:01,460 --> 01:25:02,380
Oh, my God.

2251
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:03,260
Please.

2252
01:25:03,580 --> 01:25:04,280
I can't...

2253
01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:07,320
There you go.

2254
01:25:07,540 --> 01:25:08,480
That guy was scary.

2255
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:09,580
That...

2256
01:25:09,580 --> 01:25:10,340
No.

2257
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:10,980
No.

2258
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:11,880
No tips.

2259
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:13,540
No tips.

2260
01:25:14,020 --> 01:25:14,420
Okay.

2261
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:15,880
Okay.

2262
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:17,000
We're okay.

2263
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:18,740
We're okay, guys.

2264
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:21,060
I lived.

2265
01:25:21,860 --> 01:25:24,460
I used a bit too many flasks.

2266
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:27,060
But I live.

2267
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:32,080
I just don't know my timings, okay?

2268
01:25:32,420 --> 01:25:32,980
I just...

2269
01:25:32,980 --> 01:25:35,220
I just don't know the timing for this.

2270
01:25:35,820 --> 01:25:36,960
There's so many.

2271
01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:40,360
Jesus Christ.

2272
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:41,340
He has a wolf?

2273
01:25:44,490 --> 01:25:45,010
Okay.

2274
01:25:45,150 --> 01:25:46,950
This might not be a...

2275
01:25:48,630 --> 01:25:49,670
This might be bad.

2276
01:25:50,370 --> 01:25:52,630
Like, I could get so many kills if I do this.

2277
01:25:54,850 --> 01:25:55,370
Oh.

2278
01:25:57,010 --> 01:25:58,110
So many kills.

2279
01:25:58,290 --> 01:25:58,910
One kill.

2280
01:26:02,350 --> 01:26:02,790
Okay.

2281
01:26:02,910 --> 01:26:03,070
Okay.

2282
01:26:04,810 --> 01:26:05,390
That's fine.

2283
01:26:05,450 --> 01:26:05,990
Oh, fuck.

2284
01:26:07,390 --> 01:26:08,070
That's fine.

2285
01:26:10,230 --> 01:26:10,670
Wait.

2286
01:26:10,830 --> 01:26:11,370
He hit me?

2287
01:26:11,710 --> 01:26:12,350
What's your...

2288
01:26:12,350 --> 01:26:13,570
What's your range?

2289
01:26:15,050 --> 01:26:15,850
Oh, no.

2290
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:19,530
Oh, no.

2291
01:26:19,950 --> 01:26:21,830
Oh, no.

2292
01:26:22,630 --> 01:26:23,110
Okay.

2293
01:26:23,190 --> 01:26:23,590
That's fine.

2294
01:26:24,070 --> 01:26:26,210
I need to know, like, the range for this.

2295
01:26:28,150 --> 01:26:28,890
There we go.

2296
01:26:29,090 --> 01:26:29,370
We're fine.

2297
01:26:29,590 --> 01:26:29,730
See?

2298
01:26:29,870 --> 01:26:30,750
We're so healthy.

2299
01:26:32,030 --> 01:26:32,570
Yeah.

2300
01:26:32,690 --> 01:26:33,810
I was like, Jesus Christ.

2301
01:26:33,810 --> 01:26:35,210
Your range is insane.

2302
01:26:36,250 --> 01:26:36,830
Alright.

2303
01:26:36,830 --> 01:26:38,490
I have one flasks left.

2304
01:26:38,910 --> 01:26:40,610
But it was so worth it.

2305
01:26:41,390 --> 01:26:41,990
Oh.

2306
01:26:42,010 --> 01:26:43,670
There's, like, a little tunnel here.

2307
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:46,210
So worth it.

2308
01:26:47,830 --> 01:26:49,310
No enemy ahead.

2309
01:26:50,290 --> 01:26:50,750
Oh, man.

2310
01:26:55,970 --> 01:26:57,050
Oh, he's right.

2311
01:27:00,010 --> 01:27:00,490
Nice.

2312
01:27:00,890 --> 01:27:01,430
What did I get?

2313
01:27:03,890 --> 01:27:06,410
With a knife, you can use ashes of water.

2314
01:27:06,590 --> 01:27:08,670
Grant your arms new skills at Sight of Grace.

2315
01:27:08,990 --> 01:27:09,870
You can only have one skill.

2316
01:27:10,010 --> 01:27:12,770
Any skill previously had will be removed.

2317
01:27:15,570 --> 01:27:18,470
Chabby, prepare for the hell with Toki.

2318
01:27:20,930 --> 01:27:25,110
Toki out here trying to test in the message appraisal build.

2319
01:27:25,690 --> 01:27:26,970
Shake my head.

2320
01:27:30,550 --> 01:27:31,230
Alright.

2321
01:27:32,350 --> 01:27:33,610
You can use ashes of water.

2322
01:27:33,830 --> 01:27:34,990
Grant affinities to your arm.

2323
01:27:35,110 --> 01:27:36,290
What does that mean?

2324
01:27:36,970 --> 01:27:45,150
The way you can alter boost attributes and armaments type determines what affinities it can have.

2325
01:27:45,590 --> 01:27:46,950
Like, those cannot be granted.

2326
01:27:46,950 --> 01:27:48,670
I-I don't understand.

2327
01:27:49,350 --> 01:27:53,750
I-I read it, but I-I don't understand.

2328
01:27:54,650 --> 01:27:59,010
I-and so-oh, it custom-oh, it customizes my weapon.

2329
01:27:59,530 --> 01:27:59,970
Okay.

2330
01:28:00,550 --> 01:28:02,810
I was like, that makes zero sense to me.

2331
01:28:05,930 --> 01:28:06,570
Okay.

2332
01:28:07,650 --> 01:28:09,890
And I change it with the woman, right?

2333
01:28:10,810 --> 01:28:12,670
With my friends with benefits?

2334
01:28:13,810 --> 01:28:15,570
She'll change it for me, right?

2335
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:22,600
Jump attack.

2336
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,200
Heavier weapons, the better.

2337
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:29,380
Okay, you're just-I can tell you're, like, a sword-what was it called?

2338
01:28:30,280 --> 01:28:32,740
A, uh, uh, Zyko, thank you for the super chat.

2339
01:28:32,860 --> 01:28:33,440
Thank you, thank you.

2340
01:28:33,540 --> 01:28:35,340
You're a-you're a great sword.

2341
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:38,720
You're a-you're-what are they called?

2342
01:28:39,060 --> 01:28:45,380
When-when they-they're, like, the-the one that preaches to use that certain weapon.

2343
01:28:48,780 --> 01:28:51,360
No, not-yeah, great sword purist.

2344
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:53,040
I know what you are.

2345
01:28:57,960 --> 01:28:59,320
Oh my god, was that it?

2346
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:00,220
Did I do it?

2347
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:03,200
Okay, watch this.

2348
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:06,020
Nice.

2349
01:29:07,140 --> 01:29:08,300
Oh, you can't do shit.

2350
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:09,980
Oh shit, you can't do shit!

2351
01:29:11,220 --> 01:29:11,740
No.

2352
01:29:12,220 --> 01:29:13,640
Wait, I-but I jumped!

2353
01:29:16,420 --> 01:29:17,420
I jumped!

2354
01:29:20,860 --> 01:29:21,380
Okay.

2355
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:23,760
Oh nice, I got healed.

2356
01:29:24,620 --> 01:29:26,340
Let's go, someone found my message.

2357
01:29:28,060 --> 01:29:31,140
Wait, let me just-if I put multiple messages, then people-

2358
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:36,340
Action.

2359
01:29:37,540 --> 01:29:38,360
Uh...

2360
01:29:38,360 --> 01:29:39,520
Yeah, thanks.

2361
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:40,740
Right here.

2362
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:44,680
Right here.

2363
01:29:46,020 --> 01:29:48,100
Oh, loot in the- Carriage.

2364
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:48,480
Okay.

2365
01:29:51,940 --> 01:29:52,760
Engagement?

2366
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:54,520
I'm gonna engagement farm.

2367
01:29:57,340 --> 01:29:58,680
Alright, love.

2368
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:00,880
We're straight to the point.

2369
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:04,380
I'm engagement farming, guys.

2370
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:07,120
Oh, what's in here?

2371
01:30:09,660 --> 01:30:10,480
Oh, nice.

2372
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:11,140
I got a fill.

2373
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:14,160
Your greed sickens me.

2374
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:15,020
No, no, no!

2375
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:15,480
Look.

2376
01:30:15,660 --> 01:30:18,000
I'll give like a good tip too.

2377
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:19,480
Guys, don't worry.

2378
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:21,340
I'll give like...

2379
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:27,040
Enemy a hand.

2380
01:30:31,140 --> 01:30:32,180
There we go.

2381
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:33,740
What a good tip.

2382
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:35,000
Now they'll know.

2383
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:38,160
Now they'll know there's an enemy ahead, guys.

2384
01:30:38,820 --> 01:30:39,960
That's so helpful.

2385
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:43,000
Perfect.

2386
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:46,320
Look at that.

2387
01:30:48,260 --> 01:30:51,280
I'm here to help my fellow tarnish.

2388
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:53,360
Our materials.

2389
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:54,020
Oh, nice.

2390
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:57,160
I'm just helping my fellow tarnish.

2391
01:30:58,400 --> 01:30:59,940
Time for stealth.

2392
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:00,660
They're all dead.

2393
01:31:02,060 --> 01:31:03,620
Oh, there's like those guys.

2394
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:04,400
I don't know.

2395
01:31:04,540 --> 01:31:05,520
These guys are freaky.

2396
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:10,940
Oh, there's another carriage.

2397
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:14,720
Jump.

2398
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:19,760
What's in here?

2399
01:31:20,060 --> 01:31:21,820
Oh, I got a greatsword.

2400
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:25,560
Oh my god, the greatsword Paris right here is freaking out right now.

2401
01:31:25,860 --> 01:31:27,020
I got the thing he wanted.

2402
01:31:27,940 --> 01:31:30,120
Guys, you're not supposed to praise now!

2403
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:31,760
Full HP.

2404
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:34,100
You gotta wait.

2405
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:36,100
Oh, okay.

2406
01:31:36,220 --> 01:31:36,840
Now I can level up.

2407
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:37,320
Alright, guys.

2408
01:31:37,740 --> 01:31:38,900
What build do I do?

2409
01:31:39,820 --> 01:31:40,660
What's my build?

2410
01:31:42,180 --> 01:31:44,060
God, I have the praise now.

2411
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:54,160
Oh wait, is that strength?

2412
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:55,480
That's what I like.

2413
01:31:55,620 --> 01:31:55,980
Oh wait, no.

2414
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:56,620
That's not strength.

2415
01:31:57,380 --> 01:31:58,280
Wait, that's HP.

2416
01:31:58,280 --> 01:31:59,080
I was like.

2417
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:01,460
I was like.

2418
01:32:02,020 --> 01:32:02,580
Okay.

2419
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:04,440
Easy strength.

2420
01:32:04,700 --> 01:32:04,920
Swing.

2421
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:05,660
Big stick.

2422
01:32:05,940 --> 01:32:06,540
Dex quick.

2423
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:07,460
Slash east.

2424
01:32:07,980 --> 01:32:08,760
Faith healing.

2425
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:10,100
Soldier.

2426
01:32:10,220 --> 01:32:11,040
Thank you for the super chat.

2427
01:32:11,180 --> 01:32:11,420
Thank you.

2428
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:12,180
Thank you.

2429
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:13,540
Alright.

2430
01:32:15,220 --> 01:32:16,240
Zero deaths.

2431
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:18,400
Okay, wait.

2432
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:20,600
Actually, do I need to do other stuff?

2433
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:25,620
Uh...

2434
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:26,500
Do I need to...

2435
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:27,420
What's ashes of war?

2436
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:29,540
The grand skills.

2437
01:32:29,780 --> 01:32:30,020
Inevent.

2438
01:32:30,300 --> 01:32:32,480
I assume I don't do it for these yet, right?

2439
01:32:36,130 --> 01:32:37,470
I assume I don't yet.

2440
01:32:38,870 --> 01:32:40,150
I'll just wait for that.

2441
01:32:40,630 --> 01:32:41,350
Wait, he's back.

2442
01:32:42,650 --> 01:32:44,810
Oh shit, I accidentally reset.

2443
01:32:46,430 --> 01:32:47,030
Oops.

2444
01:32:48,950 --> 01:32:54,530
Legion Jack Dragoo is logging into the game, standing around the summon signs waiting for their signal.

2445
01:32:55,490 --> 01:32:57,070
Thank you for the super chat episode.

2446
01:32:57,250 --> 01:32:57,870
Thank you, thank you.

2447
01:32:58,070 --> 01:32:58,550
Stormgate.

2448
01:32:59,090 --> 01:33:00,810
Try defeating one by one.

2449
01:33:02,070 --> 01:33:03,410
Oh, are these guys?

2450
01:33:06,710 --> 01:33:07,470
Oh hey.

2451
01:33:08,950 --> 01:33:09,550
Wait.

2452
01:33:11,350 --> 01:33:12,290
What the fuck?

2453
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:22,640
Okay, he can't...

2454
01:33:22,640 --> 01:33:24,600
No, I haven't fought him yet!

2455
01:33:28,180 --> 01:33:28,560
What?

2456
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:31,300
I haven't even fought him yet!

2457
01:33:36,040 --> 01:33:37,500
It's not even...

2458
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:38,780
He's not even there!

2459
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:41,500
Mahdi...

2460
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:43,180
Mahdi, Mahdi, Mahdi!

2461
01:33:43,180 --> 01:33:43,700
Mahdi, Mahdi!

2462
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:46,500
Rarity to help us he's...

2463
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:47,680
Why did you...

2464
01:33:47,970 --> 01:33:50,420
I haven't even fought him!

2465
01:33:50,620 --> 01:33:52,680
Why did you appraise?!

2466
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:55,020
Okay...

2467
01:33:55,020 --> 01:33:55,300
He's just...

2468
01:33:55,300 --> 01:33:57,000
He's just standing there...

2469
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,120
Menacing to me.

2470
01:33:59,080 --> 01:33:59,520
Alright.

2471
01:34:00,780 --> 01:34:03,020
You think I can, like, lead him down here?

2472
01:34:06,980 --> 01:34:08,500
Can you go past it?

2473
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:10,800
Hello?

2474
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:13,020
Hey.

2475
01:34:16,610 --> 01:34:17,130
Hello?

2476
01:34:17,410 --> 01:34:17,750
Friend?

2477
01:34:18,870 --> 01:34:20,410
Bro, what the... Oh, shit!

2478
01:34:20,770 --> 01:34:23,650
Oh, you heal me after I got hit by the bow!

2479
01:34:25,230 --> 01:34:25,750
Okay.

2480
01:34:26,210 --> 01:34:27,970
Okay, I'm gonna lead him outside.

2481
01:34:34,230 --> 01:34:35,830
Okay, now fight him.

2482
01:34:37,170 --> 01:34:41,390
Okay... Guys,

2483
01:34:45,610 --> 01:34:46,710
now is the time!

2484
01:34:47,090 --> 01:34:48,770
Now is the... Oh, nice, okay.

2485
01:34:49,130 --> 01:34:49,730
Okay, nice.

2486
01:34:50,530 --> 01:34:52,170
Now... Oh, my God!

2487
01:34:52,470 --> 01:34:53,970
Oh, my God!

2488
01:34:54,930 --> 01:34:56,690
Oh, my God!

2489
01:35:05,890 --> 01:35:07,850
Oh, Jesus Christ.

2490
01:35:11,190 --> 01:35:12,670
Oh, my God!

2491
01:35:15,290 --> 01:35:16,610
Oh, shit, okay!

2492
01:35:18,850 --> 01:35:19,690
Oh, fuck!

2493
01:35:20,230 --> 01:35:20,930
No, no, no, no, no, no!

2494
01:35:21,790 --> 01:35:23,010
No, no, no, I'm okay.

2495
01:35:23,250 --> 01:35:23,910
I'm okay.

2496
01:35:25,390 --> 01:35:26,150
I'm okay.

2497
01:35:27,130 --> 01:35:28,330
Somehow, I'm okay.

2498
01:35:29,030 --> 01:35:31,610
Bro, okay, you were, like, a little too late with that, but that's okay.

2499
01:35:32,170 --> 01:35:32,930
That's okay.

2500
01:35:34,330 --> 01:35:36,610
That is 100% okay.

2501
01:35:40,930 --> 01:35:42,410
Oh, my God!

2502
01:35:42,750 --> 01:35:43,030
Okay.

2503
01:35:45,350 --> 01:35:46,490
Okay, I did it.

2504
01:35:46,730 --> 01:35:47,990
I... I did it!

2505
01:35:48,230 --> 01:35:50,010
Guys, I'm making a new build.

2506
01:35:50,190 --> 01:35:51,890
It's called the influencer build.

2507
01:35:51,890 --> 01:35:52,710
It's...

2508
01:35:57,490 --> 01:36:01,590
That's the... That's the... The streamer build.

2509
01:36:02,190 --> 01:36:03,510
I told you!

2510
01:36:03,770 --> 01:36:06,130
I'm pioneering a new build!

2511
01:36:06,630 --> 01:36:08,310
I'm undoing it!

2512
01:36:08,690 --> 01:36:10,270
I'm doing it!

2513
01:36:11,550 --> 01:36:12,040
Messages...

2514
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:16,460
This is near the Predator build.

2515
01:36:17,620 --> 01:36:18,620
Try.

2516
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:23,700
Try, hero.

2517
01:36:25,620 --> 01:36:26,920
Upvote this.

2518
01:36:27,460 --> 01:36:32,780
Oh, shit, I blocked.

2519
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:36,380
This is my upvote build right here.

2520
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:40,660
I knew it would work.

2521
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:44,340
Bro, okay, there's too many arrows.

2522
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:47,500
What do you want me to do here?

2523
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:51,200
Okay.

2524
01:36:53,540 --> 01:36:54,060
Jesus!

2525
01:36:54,420 --> 01:36:55,640
Oh my god, I have to jump.

2526
01:36:58,080 --> 01:36:59,060
Okay, nice.

2527
01:37:01,220 --> 01:37:01,740
Okay.

2528
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:10,460
I don't care about using... Okay, I need to... What?!

2529
01:37:10,460 --> 01:37:12,760
Where did you come from?!

2530
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:14,660
Okay.

2531
01:37:15,740 --> 01:37:17,040
I have to jump in.

2532
01:37:17,080 --> 01:37:17,540
This is dumb.

2533
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:21,620
There we go.

2534
01:37:22,460 --> 01:37:23,460
Alright, I gotta kill him.

2535
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:25,380
I'm coming over.

2536
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:27,660
I'm coming over.

2537
01:37:30,540 --> 01:37:31,420
There we go.

2538
01:37:33,540 --> 01:37:35,880
Why has nobody ever used this build before?

2539
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:36,700
It's so strong.

2540
01:37:40,820 --> 01:37:42,280
We'll replenish your flash.

2541
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:44,120
The number of attacks can replenish varies.

2542
01:37:44,780 --> 01:37:46,600
You cannot... Nice.

2543
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:50,200
Okay, there were like 200 million arrows.

2544
01:37:50,460 --> 01:37:51,560
I have to block.

2545
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:54,600
I got a golden rune.

2546
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:56,200
I got a helmet.

2547
01:37:56,760 --> 01:37:58,400
The strongest build.

2548
01:37:58,720 --> 01:37:59,920
Gee, I wonder.

2549
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:01,420
Guys, it's so easy.

2550
01:38:01,580 --> 01:38:02,600
Just be a streamer.

2551
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:08,500
Just be a content creator.

2552
01:38:08,780 --> 01:38:08,780
Just be a content creator.

2553
01:38:08,780 --> 01:38:09,560
It's so easy.

2554
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:13,320
I need healing.

2555
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:19,260
You put on a password.

2556
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:22,840
You should make a video about the content creator build.

2557
01:38:24,940 --> 01:38:26,620
Just stream.

2558
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:27,980
I don't need a horse.

2559
01:38:27,980 --> 01:38:28,960
I fight everyone.

2560
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:30,520
Alright.

2561
01:38:30,940 --> 01:38:33,420
I need healing.

2562
01:38:37,670 --> 01:38:38,080
Wait.

2563
01:38:38,440 --> 01:38:39,340
Oh my god!

2564
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:40,160
Wait a minute!

2565
01:38:40,580 --> 01:38:42,320
He blew his horn!

2566
01:38:43,580 --> 01:38:44,820
That's cheating!

2567
01:38:45,240 --> 01:38:47,680
I say it as I'm abusing heals.

2568
01:38:51,690 --> 01:38:52,850
Okay, nice.

2569
01:38:55,690 --> 01:38:56,830
Oh, shit.

2570
01:38:58,930 --> 01:38:59,530
That's right.

2571
01:38:59,610 --> 01:39:01,110
I'll slash you one by one.

2572
01:39:01,770 --> 01:39:02,550
Oh my god.

2573
01:39:02,670 --> 01:39:03,110
That's not good.

2574
01:39:03,610 --> 01:39:04,070
Oh my god.

2575
01:39:04,190 --> 01:39:05,330
I'm fucking staggered.

2576
01:39:08,830 --> 01:39:09,310
Bye.

2577
01:39:10,310 --> 01:39:11,050
I'm okay.

2578
01:39:12,890 --> 01:39:13,990
No archer head.

2579
01:39:14,110 --> 01:39:14,850
Oh, that's good to know.

2580
01:39:17,250 --> 01:39:19,430
No way he said that.

2581
01:39:20,290 --> 01:39:22,970
Can't believe he tried to outplay me.

2582
01:39:26,310 --> 01:39:26,890
Alright.

2583
01:39:30,070 --> 01:39:30,930
See ya.

2584
01:39:33,850 --> 01:39:35,690
That should be everybody, right?

2585
01:39:36,170 --> 01:39:38,110
I mean, it's good for a level up here.

2586
01:39:41,370 --> 01:39:42,670
Alright, alright, alright.

2587
01:39:42,670 --> 01:39:44,890
I won't abuse my messages anymore.

2588
01:39:45,770 --> 01:39:49,890
I just wanted to test out the content creator build, okay?

2589
01:39:50,290 --> 01:39:52,270
I wanted to know if it works.

2590
01:39:52,430 --> 01:39:54,710
And we discovered that it works.

2591
01:39:57,070 --> 01:39:58,350
I won't...

2592
01:39:58,350 --> 01:40:01,250
For now, I won't abuse them.

2593
01:40:04,630 --> 01:40:10,390
It's not my fault that it's such a strong build, guys.

2594
01:40:10,650 --> 01:40:12,850
Is it truly my fault?

2595
01:40:13,030 --> 01:40:17,270
If there's a way to cheese, you know I take advantage of it.

2596
01:40:20,250 --> 01:40:24,290
The only way I can heal is to have messages.

2597
01:40:24,290 --> 01:40:24,450
It's not my fault, dude.

2598
01:40:28,010 --> 01:40:28,490
It's...

2599
01:40:28,490 --> 01:40:30,270
Yeah, it's in the game.

2600
01:40:32,790 --> 01:40:34,070
A wolf?

2601
01:40:35,910 --> 01:40:38,650
Rain ahead, but didn't expect a wolf?

2602
01:40:39,870 --> 01:40:41,490
Up dog ahead.

2603
01:40:43,110 --> 01:40:44,070
Oh.

2604
01:40:45,050 --> 01:40:45,670
Oh.

2605
01:40:46,950 --> 01:40:47,910
Whoa.

2606
01:40:49,370 --> 01:40:50,530
Don't worry.

2607
01:40:51,290 --> 01:40:52,410
I'm ready.

2608
01:40:54,950 --> 01:40:55,690
Okay.

2609
01:40:56,370 --> 01:40:56,930
Come on.

2610
01:40:57,210 --> 01:40:59,190
Get a little closer.

2611
01:41:01,090 --> 01:41:02,370
Get a little...

2612
01:41:02,370 --> 01:41:03,050
I'm ready.

2613
01:41:04,270 --> 01:41:05,430
There we go.

2614
01:41:05,950 --> 01:41:06,830
That's right.

2615
01:41:07,210 --> 01:41:07,910
Come back.

2616
01:41:08,310 --> 01:41:10,170
Oh, you're gonna walk away?

2617
01:41:10,670 --> 01:41:12,210
I don't need arrows.

2618
01:41:13,470 --> 01:41:14,730
Oh, you pussy.

2619
01:41:15,310 --> 01:41:17,030
I thought you were was.

2620
01:41:17,670 --> 01:41:18,710
Are you a pussy?

2621
01:41:19,170 --> 01:41:21,570
Oh god, we're making her immortal.

2622
01:41:21,570 --> 01:41:24,010
Hey, thank you for the super chat.

2623
01:41:24,210 --> 01:41:24,550
Thank you.

2624
01:41:24,750 --> 01:41:25,330
Thank you.

2625
01:41:27,390 --> 01:41:28,110
That's right.

2626
01:41:28,350 --> 01:41:29,930
I thought I was fighting wolves.

2627
01:41:30,590 --> 01:41:31,570
Not fucking pussycats.

2628
01:41:32,870 --> 01:41:33,590
Get over here!

2629
01:41:36,590 --> 01:41:37,390
Oh my god.

2630
01:41:37,530 --> 01:41:39,110
Why were they so afraid of these wolves?

2631
01:41:40,810 --> 01:41:41,590
That's fucking right.

2632
01:41:41,650 --> 01:41:42,530
Oh, you're gonna walk away?

2633
01:41:42,730 --> 01:41:43,950
He's just like, okay, I'm...

2634
01:41:43,950 --> 01:41:44,750
Okay, I'll leave.

2635
01:41:45,870 --> 01:41:46,590
Okay, leave.

2636
01:41:48,950 --> 01:41:51,850
He saw his friend's dad and he's like, alright.

2637
01:41:52,350 --> 01:41:53,630
Nice to see you, sir.

2638
01:41:57,430 --> 01:41:58,030
Whoa!

2639
01:41:58,950 --> 01:41:59,390
Nice.

2640
01:41:59,810 --> 01:42:01,270
I'm so good at this.

2641
01:42:03,090 --> 01:42:03,890
Oh, wait.

2642
01:42:04,210 --> 01:42:05,590
I kicked the baby.

2643
01:42:06,590 --> 01:42:07,650
Wait, what is that?

2644
01:42:09,450 --> 01:42:10,450
Is that nothing?

2645
01:42:11,530 --> 01:42:12,130
Oh.

2646
01:42:12,610 --> 01:42:13,210
Oh.

2647
01:42:13,330 --> 01:42:15,190
Oh, I had to destroy it.

2648
01:42:15,730 --> 01:42:15,990
Oh.

2649
01:42:17,170 --> 01:42:19,230
I was like, why can't I do anything?

2650
01:42:19,670 --> 01:42:20,490
What's over there?

2651
01:42:24,010 --> 01:42:24,610
Oh.

2652
01:42:24,850 --> 01:42:25,850
There's a campfire.

2653
01:42:30,220 --> 01:42:30,820
Okay.

2654
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:34,600
Yay!

2655
01:42:36,460 --> 01:42:37,940
Wait, I want free stuff.

2656
01:42:39,940 --> 01:42:41,440
Oh, there's another woman.

2657
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:43,440
Wait, whoops.

2658
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:45,460
Wait, I want to...

2659
01:42:45,460 --> 01:42:46,820
...steal his stuff first.

2660
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:48,940
Well, it's not stealing if he's already dead.

2661
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:50,720
Hello.

2662
01:42:53,340 --> 01:42:54,420
Lovable sword.

2663
01:42:55,420 --> 01:42:56,080
Angel.

2664
01:42:56,420 --> 01:42:57,220
Oh, angel.

2665
01:43:05,980 --> 01:43:07,220
Oh my god.

2666
01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:10,320
You must be truly beautiful.

2667
01:43:14,240 --> 01:43:14,600
It's...

2668
01:43:15,460 --> 01:43:16,100
Taken...

2669
01:43:17,420 --> 01:43:19,160
Taken and stuck...

2670
01:43:19,160 --> 01:43:20,140
To the spider.

2671
01:43:20,140 --> 01:43:21,380
It's called grave robin?

2672
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:22,480
It's okay, I'm British.

2673
01:43:22,820 --> 01:43:22,860
Did you know...

2674
01:43:22,860 --> 01:43:24,060
You're grafted by the spider.

2675
01:43:24,860 --> 01:43:26,700
You become a chrysalid.

2676
01:43:27,160 --> 01:43:29,740
It's quite a lark when you think about it.

2677
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:32,960
Okay.

2678
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:35,280
Alright.

2679
01:43:35,860 --> 01:43:37,100
Guys, I'm not cheesing.

2680
01:43:37,100 --> 01:43:38,740
I just want people to know.

2681
01:43:41,860 --> 01:43:42,480
Let's see.

2682
01:43:44,780 --> 01:43:45,880
Where is it?

2683
01:43:51,490 --> 01:43:52,650
Where is it?

2684
01:43:59,140 --> 01:44:00,700
Where the fuck is it?

2685
01:44:00,700 --> 01:44:02,700
I need a note.

2686
01:44:08,130 --> 01:44:08,530
Door...

2687
01:44:09,330 --> 01:44:12,550
Brian F was right about you.

2688
01:44:13,010 --> 01:44:14,190
What did I do?

2689
01:44:18,050 --> 01:44:19,870
What did I even do?

2690
01:44:20,210 --> 01:44:20,910
I'm playing...

2691
01:44:20,910 --> 01:44:22,270
I'm just playing the game.

2692
01:44:23,350 --> 01:44:24,670
Where is it?

2693
01:44:30,470 --> 01:44:32,070
Oh my god.

2694
01:44:32,490 --> 01:44:34,110
Do I not have it?

2695
01:44:34,970 --> 01:44:36,330
Do I...

2696
01:44:36,330 --> 01:44:38,910
Do I not have maiden?

2697
01:44:39,430 --> 01:44:40,650
Are you serious?

2698
01:44:46,270 --> 01:44:47,150
Monarch.

2699
01:44:47,430 --> 01:44:47,630
Lord.

2700
01:44:47,890 --> 01:44:49,450
I'm looking for maiden.

2701
01:44:51,250 --> 01:44:52,930
No maiden.

2702
01:44:53,390 --> 01:44:53,710
No!

2703
01:44:53,930 --> 01:44:55,530
There must be maiden!

2704
01:44:56,530 --> 01:44:58,030
There's no way!

2705
01:45:02,300 --> 01:45:03,680
No you deserve...

2706
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:06,780
I deserve maidens!

2707
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:10,300
I have...

2708
01:45:10,300 --> 01:45:10,700
Okay.

2709
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:14,880
I have to un...

2710
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:16,760
I have to unlock maiden?

2711
01:45:17,700 --> 01:45:18,520
That's it.

2712
01:45:19,200 --> 01:45:21,780
People will believe me when I...

2713
01:45:21,780 --> 01:45:26,300
People will believe me.

2714
01:45:31,070 --> 01:45:31,910
Lover.

2715
01:45:35,610 --> 01:45:37,170
I'm gonna tell everybody at school.

2716
01:45:37,490 --> 01:45:38,410
I'm gonna...

2717
01:45:43,490 --> 01:45:45,870
I'm telling everyone at school.

2718
01:45:47,370 --> 01:45:49,890
A very truthful message.

2719
01:45:54,430 --> 01:45:55,870
Wait, I can talk to her more?

2720
01:45:57,510 --> 01:45:58,390
Try head...

2721
01:45:58,390 --> 01:45:58,850
Butthole.

2722
01:45:59,370 --> 01:46:00,950
Francisca, thank you for the super chat.

2723
01:46:01,090 --> 01:46:01,950
Thank you, thank you.

2724
01:46:02,330 --> 01:46:03,830
Phoebe, thank you for the 10 gift of ships.

2725
01:46:04,010 --> 01:46:04,830
Thank you, thank you.

2726
01:46:05,650 --> 01:46:08,230
Enticed by the one in the white mask, I suppose.

2727
01:46:10,370 --> 01:46:13,950
Well, you've come to be one with the spider.

2728
01:46:14,610 --> 01:46:15,050
Yeah?

2729
01:46:15,050 --> 01:46:17,070
That makes us two peas in a pod.

2730
01:46:17,290 --> 01:46:18,970
But I don't have your courage.

2731
01:46:19,630 --> 01:46:22,410
It's scary, you know, having your arms cut off.

2732
01:46:22,730 --> 01:46:23,610
Or legs.

2733
01:46:23,770 --> 01:46:24,410
I mean, yeah.

2734
01:46:24,650 --> 01:46:26,450
I mean, that's pretty painful, too.

2735
01:46:26,770 --> 01:46:29,150
Like everyone else, but I'm just too scared.

2736
01:46:29,870 --> 01:46:31,290
I'm nothing but a craven.

2737
01:46:32,110 --> 01:46:33,310
I think she's Scottish.

2738
01:46:33,310 --> 01:46:33,550
A jellyfish.

2739
01:46:33,770 --> 01:46:34,650
Oh, I know.

2740
01:46:35,410 --> 01:46:37,730
Can you take this little one along with you?

2741
01:46:37,910 --> 01:46:38,070
Oh?

2742
01:46:39,350 --> 01:46:41,130
Oh, I got a jellyfish!

2743
01:46:41,550 --> 01:46:44,230
The poor thing deserves someone brave and a nicer.

2744
01:46:44,250 --> 01:46:44,870
What does that do?

2745
01:46:45,830 --> 01:46:46,370
And...

2746
01:46:46,370 --> 01:46:49,070
The spirits look rather fondly upon you.

2747
01:46:49,690 --> 01:46:50,570
It'll be glad...

2748
01:46:50,570 --> 01:46:51,230
Make...

2749
01:46:51,230 --> 01:46:52,470
Thank you for the gifted ship.

2750
01:46:52,650 --> 01:46:53,470
Thank you, thank you.

2751
01:46:57,600 --> 01:46:58,520
Oh, Welsh?

2752
01:46:58,700 --> 01:46:59,320
Is she Welsh?

2753
01:46:59,960 --> 01:47:02,760
You can use ash to summon various spirits.

2754
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:04,060
Typically...

2755
01:47:04,060 --> 01:47:04,840
Consumes...

2756
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:06,620
You can only summon one type of spirit.

2757
01:47:07,220 --> 01:47:07,340
Oh!

2758
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:12,320
To the merchant?

2759
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:13,400
Why is she the merchant?

2760
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:16,000
What would the merchant do for me?

2761
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:21,400
Oh, go back to the church?

2762
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:21,820
Okay.

2763
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:23,060
Oh, I got another charge.

2764
01:47:23,540 --> 01:47:23,780
Yes.

2765
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:25,160
Alright.

2766
01:47:26,060 --> 01:47:27,460
Let me, like, make sure it's just that.

2767
01:47:28,220 --> 01:47:29,400
Talk to Melania?

2768
01:47:29,800 --> 01:47:30,300
Melina?

2769
01:47:32,340 --> 01:47:32,620
Hello.

2770
01:47:32,840 --> 01:47:33,320
Oh.

2771
01:47:33,820 --> 01:47:35,420
Hello, my friends with benefits.

2772
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:39,400
This tiny golden aura is the grace of the earth tree.

2773
01:47:39,700 --> 01:47:40,940
This light...

2774
01:47:40,940 --> 01:47:44,580
Once shone in the eyes of your tarnished brethren.

2775
01:47:45,240 --> 01:47:46,480
But now...

2776
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:48,640
It is all that guides you.

2777
01:47:50,100 --> 01:47:51,280
Also, I hear...

2778
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:53,260
You can see them, can't you?

2779
01:47:53,660 --> 01:47:55,340
The rays of grace...

2780
01:47:55,900 --> 01:47:58,540
That guide you through your burden.

2781
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,420
She levels me up!

2782
01:48:00,540 --> 01:48:01,420
That's a benefit!

2783
01:48:03,060 --> 01:48:04,580
I don't understand!

2784
01:48:09,620 --> 01:48:10,860
Do they go to the church?

2785
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:11,920
Oh, back to the merchant?

2786
01:48:12,380 --> 01:48:14,560
A fragment of the shattered Elden Ring.

2787
01:48:15,220 --> 01:48:20,560
If the rays of grace signal the castle, then the Elden Ring beckons you.

2788
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:27,100
As an ally by Pact, I pray that you are fit to face the challenge presented...

2789
01:48:27,100 --> 01:48:28,260
I think we are dragons.

2790
01:48:28,940 --> 01:48:30,060
This is a team effort.

2791
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:32,060
Oh, can I level up now?

2792
01:48:32,840 --> 01:48:33,260
To strength.

2793
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:36,080
Let my hand rest upon you.

2794
01:48:37,220 --> 01:48:38,300
For but a moment...

2795
01:48:39,380 --> 01:48:40,120
Share them with you.

2796
01:48:40,140 --> 01:48:41,680
Alright, what do we do next, guys?

2797
01:48:41,940 --> 01:48:42,920
Ooh, I have a lot!

2798
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:44,740
Your ambitions.

2799
01:48:45,820 --> 01:48:48,000
The principles you would follow.

2800
01:48:50,120 --> 01:48:51,740
Oh my gosh, she held...

2801
01:48:51,740 --> 01:48:53,800
I love how she holds my hand every time.

2802
01:48:54,620 --> 01:48:55,200
More...

2803
01:48:55,200 --> 01:48:55,820
More HP?

2804
01:48:56,100 --> 01:48:56,320
Okay.

2805
01:48:57,020 --> 01:48:58,520
I could do another one.

2806
01:48:58,640 --> 01:48:59,440
I'm pretty sure.

2807
01:49:00,540 --> 01:49:01,700
And then...

2808
01:49:01,700 --> 01:49:03,120
Dexterity or...

2809
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:03,720
Or heals?

2810
01:49:03,980 --> 01:49:05,080
HP or heals?

2811
01:49:05,480 --> 01:49:06,300
Or strength?

2812
01:49:09,240 --> 01:49:09,920
Oh, sorry.

2813
01:49:10,060 --> 01:49:10,660
That's two things.

2814
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:10,960
Sorry.

2815
01:49:11,100 --> 01:49:11,600
I meant...

2816
01:49:12,280 --> 01:49:13,420
Max is a 20?

2817
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:14,320
Okay.

2818
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:16,640
Alright.

2819
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:18,800
We'll get to 20 first.

2820
01:49:20,940 --> 01:49:21,420
Alright.

2821
01:49:22,280 --> 01:49:22,760
Bye.

2822
01:49:23,260 --> 01:49:25,240
I held her hand and then she...

2823
01:49:25,240 --> 01:49:26,660
She got Thanos'd.

2824
01:49:26,820 --> 01:49:28,680
Cause I guess it was just too much, I guess.

2825
01:49:29,160 --> 01:49:29,460
I...

2826
01:49:31,680 --> 01:49:32,860
Well, excuse me!

2827
01:49:36,300 --> 01:49:39,540
I guess holding my hand was just a little too much.

2828
01:49:40,420 --> 01:49:42,100
Where the fuck is the church?

2829
01:49:43,980 --> 01:49:45,300
Is this a...

2830
01:49:46,020 --> 01:49:47,160
Oh, there she is.

2831
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:50,020
Excuse me, princess.

2832
01:49:50,860 --> 01:49:52,420
I washed my hands.

2833
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:54,180
Maybe it...

2834
01:49:54,180 --> 01:49:54,480
Oh!

2835
01:49:54,740 --> 01:49:56,160
Wife number three!

2836
01:49:57,860 --> 01:49:58,460
Hello?

2837
01:49:59,060 --> 01:49:59,960
Oh my god!

2838
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:01,780
You're the lady with all the hands!

2839
01:50:02,220 --> 01:50:05,220
You know what they say about a lady with four arms.

2840
01:50:05,220 --> 01:50:07,320
A pleasure to meet thee, Tarnished.

2841
01:50:07,980 --> 01:50:09,380
I am the witch Renna.

2842
01:50:09,540 --> 01:50:11,000
Okay, I'm...

2843
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:14,140
I can tell the Tarnished hurtling about atop a spectral steed.

2844
01:50:14,260 --> 01:50:19,640
And upon looking into the matter, the talk I surmise is of thee.

2845
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:22,420
Thou art possessed of the power, no?

2846
01:50:22,980 --> 01:50:25,840
To call forth a spectral steed named Torrent.

2847
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:25,900
What?

2848
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:28,720
I can call...

2849
01:50:28,720 --> 01:50:29,280
Oh, yeah, I can.

2850
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:36,200
As I had hoped, I was entrusted this for thee, by Torrent's former master.

2851
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:37,140
Oh?

2852
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:39,740
Oh, it's the calling bell!

2853
01:50:39,740 --> 01:50:39,820
Yeah!

2854
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:42,880
Oh, now I get worse!

2855
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:44,420
It is a battle of calling forth spirits.

2856
01:50:45,240 --> 01:50:46,460
Summon them with it.

2857
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:49,600
From ash and return to the earth tree.

2858
01:50:49,800 --> 01:50:52,800
The spirits will obey thine command, but briefly.

2859
01:50:53,580 --> 01:50:55,780
As they recall battles past.

2860
01:50:56,360 --> 01:50:58,060
Now it is thine...

2861
01:50:58,060 --> 01:51:00,260
To do with as thou wishest.

2862
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:01,880
Okay.

2863
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:03,960
People will...

2864
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:04,440
Oh, my...

2865
01:51:04,440 --> 01:51:05,820
People in school will believe me.

2866
01:51:08,380 --> 01:51:09,140
Behold!

2867
01:51:11,660 --> 01:51:12,040
Lover!

2868
01:51:13,540 --> 01:51:15,860
I'm gonna tell everybody at school.

2869
01:51:19,060 --> 01:51:21,540
Forgive mine intrusion tarnished.

2870
01:51:21,900 --> 01:51:23,940
I doubt we shall again meet.

2871
01:51:24,740 --> 01:51:28,900
But all the same, learn well the lands between.

2872
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:31,160
He checks out.

2873
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:35,860
Before the tarnished tire of obeisance to the two fingers.

2874
01:51:37,660 --> 01:51:38,120
Oh!

2875
01:51:38,660 --> 01:51:39,300
Goodbye!

2876
01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:41,640
She didn't even touch my hand!

2877
01:51:43,740 --> 01:51:45,640
The picture didn't happen.

2878
01:51:45,860 --> 01:51:47,040
I left a message.

2879
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:48,160
That's the picture.

2880
01:51:49,860 --> 01:51:51,860
The picture is my message.

2881
01:51:52,760 --> 01:51:54,220
You just gotta be there, bro.

2882
01:51:54,540 --> 01:51:55,740
You just had to be there.

2883
01:52:01,690 --> 01:52:02,290
Alright.

2884
01:52:03,210 --> 01:52:05,110
Ooh, I don't like that it's night time.

2885
01:52:05,450 --> 01:52:07,430
Let me make it day real quick.

2886
01:52:08,570 --> 01:52:09,770
Let me...

2887
01:52:10,790 --> 01:52:11,390
Morning!

2888
01:52:15,090 --> 01:52:17,450
She just goes to a different school!

2889
01:52:20,190 --> 01:52:22,010
Wait, why is it still night time?

2890
01:52:25,130 --> 01:52:25,870
Yeah.

2891
01:52:25,950 --> 01:52:27,190
Yeah, but I don't need summons.

2892
01:52:28,410 --> 01:52:29,670
I'm not a...

2893
01:52:29,670 --> 01:52:30,790
I need summons.

2894
01:52:32,610 --> 01:52:33,790
I can't...

2895
01:52:33,790 --> 01:52:35,510
I saw four people.

2896
01:52:35,910 --> 01:52:36,750
Give me a sec.

2897
01:52:37,210 --> 01:52:38,050
Let me...

2898
01:52:38,740 --> 01:52:40,870
I saw four and I got a little scared.

2899
01:52:42,170 --> 01:52:42,910
I...

2900
01:52:42,910 --> 01:52:43,970
Switch.

2901
01:52:43,970 --> 01:52:44,270
Switch.

2902
01:52:46,490 --> 01:52:47,090
This?

2903
01:52:48,810 --> 01:52:49,710
What is this?

2904
01:52:49,810 --> 01:52:51,630
Summons three lone wolves.

2905
01:52:51,810 --> 01:52:53,250
Oh, I don't have enough for that.

2906
01:52:55,950 --> 01:52:56,890
Is that it?

2907
01:52:59,830 --> 01:53:02,150
Doki meds wore off and the third...

2908
01:53:03,190 --> 01:53:03,790
Disappeared.

2909
01:53:03,930 --> 01:53:06,510
No, I took my meds and she's gone!

2910
01:53:07,530 --> 01:53:09,750
How could this happen to me?

2911
01:53:12,810 --> 01:53:14,870
Wait, how do I use my summons?

2912
01:53:20,040 --> 01:53:21,840
I can only use it?

2913
01:53:26,040 --> 01:53:27,140
Give me a sec.

2914
01:53:29,820 --> 01:53:30,340
Wait, what?

2915
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:32,520
Oh!

2916
01:53:32,820 --> 01:53:34,700
It's only in certain places!

2917
01:53:35,280 --> 01:53:35,920
Goddammit!

2918
01:53:36,680 --> 01:53:38,600
I did all that for nothing!

2919
01:53:42,260 --> 01:53:42,860
That's fine.

2920
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:45,160
Oh, hey.

2921
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:45,680
Noink.

2922
01:53:49,410 --> 01:53:50,310
He's gonna turn around.

2923
01:53:50,630 --> 01:53:51,870
Don't worry, I got this.

2924
01:53:54,950 --> 01:53:56,390
Guys, thank you for the super chat.

2925
01:53:56,550 --> 01:53:57,150
Thank you.

2926
01:53:57,330 --> 01:53:58,550
Doki's maiden was so strong.

2927
01:53:58,730 --> 01:54:01,150
Man simply banished in presence.

2928
01:54:01,990 --> 01:54:02,310
Okay.

2929
01:54:04,410 --> 01:54:05,290
Watch this.

2930
01:54:11,200 --> 01:54:12,080
Turn around.

2931
01:54:12,440 --> 01:54:13,220
Turn around.

2932
01:54:14,080 --> 01:54:16,940
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

2933
01:54:16,940 --> 01:54:47,440
Ba-ba-ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da Alright,

2934
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:51,140
they turned around.

2935
01:54:53,120 --> 01:54:54,200
Alright, nice.

2936
01:54:54,660 --> 01:54:55,720
Wait, what's that over there?

2937
01:54:55,840 --> 01:54:57,700
Oh, we accidentally pressed my map.

2938
01:54:58,220 --> 01:55:00,960
Cause I was like, what the fuck actually marked that?

2939
01:55:01,060 --> 01:55:02,740
I was like, what is that?

2940
01:55:03,140 --> 01:55:03,460
Okay.

2941
01:55:04,100 --> 01:55:07,100
Uh, let's follow the path, I guess.

2942
01:55:08,540 --> 01:55:10,940
I can't believe this.

2943
01:55:13,640 --> 01:55:14,560
Seek rump.

2944
01:55:14,680 --> 01:55:15,700
Oh my god, is there another maiden?

2945
01:55:17,620 --> 01:55:19,300
Is there another...

2946
01:55:20,460 --> 01:55:24,760
Yeah, but I can gain, like, more, uh, more XP.

2947
01:55:25,960 --> 01:55:27,400
No sword fighter ahead.

2948
01:55:27,700 --> 01:55:28,380
I trust that.

2949
01:55:29,500 --> 01:55:31,840
Let there be circling around, but be wary of group.

2950
01:55:32,020 --> 01:55:32,700
Oh, I killed him.

2951
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:37,660
I think mouse and keyboard is fine.

2952
01:55:38,140 --> 01:55:39,120
Oh, there they are.

2953
01:55:42,420 --> 01:55:44,580
I don't know, maybe controller is easier?

2954
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:45,540
I don't know.

2955
01:55:50,160 --> 01:55:52,780
I can't tell if it is easier or not.

2956
01:55:56,330 --> 01:55:57,400
He doesn't know.

2957
01:55:58,580 --> 01:55:59,060
See?

2958
01:56:08,070 --> 01:56:10,290
I told you he didn't know.

2959
01:56:10,670 --> 01:56:11,930
Wait, there's a blue Acon!

2960
01:56:17,590 --> 01:56:18,470
Let's go!

2961
01:56:20,310 --> 01:56:20,930
Yeah!

2962
01:56:21,590 --> 01:56:22,350
Oh my god!

2963
01:56:22,650 --> 01:56:23,650
You got this, bro!

2964
01:56:24,110 --> 01:56:24,470
I

2965
01:56:31,220 --> 01:56:32,340
believe in you!

2966
01:56:36,990 --> 01:56:38,530
Oh shit, bro!

2967
01:56:40,490 --> 01:56:42,810
I think I might need to help the bro out.

2968
01:56:43,230 --> 01:56:43,590
I...

2969
01:56:46,710 --> 01:56:50,010
Guys, I don't think bro is doing so well.

2970
01:56:53,830 --> 01:56:55,130
It's okay, we did it.

2971
01:56:55,450 --> 01:56:56,050
Please.

2972
01:56:56,290 --> 01:56:57,730
She's just a child.

2973
01:56:59,150 --> 01:56:59,890
Watch this.

2974
01:57:00,470 --> 01:57:00,630
What?

2975
01:57:00,890 --> 01:57:01,670
Oh, I did not...

2976
01:57:01,670 --> 01:57:02,310
Sorry, not...

2977
01:57:04,410 --> 01:57:05,610
Oh shit!

2978
01:57:08,470 --> 01:57:09,810
Oh my god!

2979
01:57:10,430 --> 01:57:11,070
Come on!

2980
01:57:12,210 --> 01:57:12,850
What?

2981
01:57:12,990 --> 01:57:14,230
What hit me?!

2982
01:57:14,230 --> 01:57:15,830
Oh fuck!

2983
01:57:16,930 --> 01:57:17,570
Okay!

2984
01:57:17,810 --> 01:57:19,770
Okay, I did not expect that!

2985
01:57:20,410 --> 01:57:22,250
Oh no, not him!

2986
01:57:22,590 --> 01:57:23,830
Not this fucker!

2987
01:57:24,250 --> 01:57:25,750
Not this fucker!

2988
01:57:26,650 --> 01:57:27,030
Not this fucker!

2989
01:57:30,280 --> 01:57:31,380
Jesus Christ!

2990
01:57:33,280 --> 01:57:34,140
There you go!

2991
01:57:34,940 --> 01:57:38,640
Okay, I don't think the other guy saw me though, so we should be fine.

2992
01:57:40,240 --> 01:57:41,140
Okay, nice.

2993
01:57:43,880 --> 01:57:44,440
Alright.

2994
01:57:44,780 --> 01:57:47,920
I have no idea where the big guy is.

2995
01:57:48,080 --> 01:57:49,060
I don't know!

2996
01:57:52,280 --> 01:57:52,840
Okay.

2997
01:57:53,700 --> 01:57:55,340
I need to find the other guy.

2998
01:57:56,800 --> 01:57:58,100
Okay, there he is.

2999
01:57:58,300 --> 01:57:59,460
Okay, now I know.

3000
01:57:59,800 --> 01:58:01,460
Okay, watch this!

3001
01:58:01,780 --> 01:58:03,520
They literally explode!

3002
01:58:04,060 --> 01:58:06,460
I didn't know they have a fucking ballistic!

3003
01:58:11,770 --> 01:58:12,830
Get outta here!

3004
01:58:16,730 --> 01:58:18,510
Tarnished, you don't have...

3005
01:58:18,510 --> 01:58:19,290
Beware!

3006
01:58:19,530 --> 01:58:20,130
Thank you!

3007
01:58:20,330 --> 01:58:20,950
Thank you!

3008
01:58:21,010 --> 01:58:23,590
Thank you for letting me know about this guy!

3009
01:58:23,830 --> 01:58:25,810
I really appreciate it!

3010
01:58:28,650 --> 01:58:29,730
I missed!

3011
01:58:30,070 --> 01:58:30,270
How?

3012
01:58:30,550 --> 01:58:31,610
How did...

3013
01:58:32,730 --> 01:58:33,470
Oh shit!

3014
01:58:36,090 --> 01:58:37,610
Oh my god!

3015
01:58:37,870 --> 01:58:38,630
Stop moving!

3016
01:58:41,450 --> 01:58:44,810
That was the true maiden all along!

3017
01:58:45,730 --> 01:58:46,070
Okay.

3018
01:58:46,490 --> 01:58:47,450
We did it!

3019
01:58:47,870 --> 01:58:48,670
What the fuck?

3020
01:58:49,730 --> 01:58:51,050
How did he do that?

3021
01:58:51,390 --> 01:58:52,710
I wanna read this message!

3022
01:58:53,630 --> 01:58:55,910
No close corner paddles ahead!

3023
01:58:56,230 --> 01:58:56,330
Okay.

3024
01:58:59,210 --> 01:59:01,610
They have a ballistic!

3025
01:59:02,590 --> 01:59:04,010
Wait, what if I...

3026
01:59:04,930 --> 01:59:06,210
Wait, I have an idea.

3027
01:59:08,390 --> 01:59:10,370
I have an idea.

3028
01:59:15,170 --> 01:59:17,070
Behold, morning.

3029
01:59:21,130 --> 01:59:21,830
Okay.

3030
01:59:26,340 --> 01:59:28,220
No enemies ahead.

3031
01:59:38,660 --> 01:59:39,820
There we go.

3032
01:59:41,500 --> 01:59:42,160
Nice.

3033
01:59:42,940 --> 01:59:44,200
That's crazy!

3034
01:59:45,780 --> 01:59:46,860
What's over here?

3035
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,340
Wait, why did a lot of people die here?

3036
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:51,640
Wait a minute!

3037
01:59:56,120 --> 01:59:57,520
Wait.

3038
01:59:57,520 --> 01:59:58,280
What?

3039
01:59:58,700 --> 02:00:00,460
There's so...

3040
02:00:00,460 --> 02:00:03,900
There's so many people dying here!

3041
02:00:04,140 --> 02:00:07,080
Get those messages ready!

3042
02:00:12,320 --> 02:00:15,120
First off...

3043
02:00:17,040 --> 02:00:18,360
Guys, I'm so lazy!

3044
02:00:18,360 --> 02:00:18,580
Heads!

3045
02:00:21,100 --> 02:00:21,760
Heads!

3046
02:00:23,220 --> 02:00:24,180
Just asking politely.

3047
02:00:25,620 --> 02:00:26,920
What killed them?

3048
02:00:27,480 --> 02:00:31,020
What- Nice!

3049
02:00:32,380 --> 02:00:33,420
Alright.

3050
02:00:34,760 --> 02:00:36,200
Seek good luck.

3051
02:00:37,300 --> 02:00:38,780
Mist or Beast.

3052
02:00:44,090 --> 02:00:44,690
Oh!

3053
02:00:45,550 --> 02:00:46,010
Her!

3054
02:00:46,550 --> 02:00:49,470
Wait, that's the guy that my dad keeps dying to!

3055
02:00:50,110 --> 02:00:50,970
That's him!

3056
02:00:51,290 --> 02:00:52,310
Wait, Gold Summon?

3057
02:00:52,750 --> 02:00:53,730
What is that?

3058
02:00:54,890 --> 02:00:56,530
Help me, oh help me on.

3059
02:00:58,750 --> 02:01:00,130
That's the first one!

3060
02:01:03,450 --> 02:01:04,850
Oh, I should level her.

3061
02:01:05,150 --> 02:01:06,970
I should level up the Dragoon.

3062
02:01:08,730 --> 02:01:09,410
You're right.

3063
02:01:12,790 --> 02:01:14,490
Alright, oh, I'll talk to her.

3064
02:01:18,010 --> 02:01:18,470
Me?

3065
02:01:19,150 --> 02:01:20,130
I'm searching.

3066
02:01:20,710 --> 02:01:22,090
For my purpose.

3067
02:01:22,870 --> 02:01:26,190
Given to me by my mother inside the earth tree.

3068
02:01:27,410 --> 02:01:28,850
Ok, Dragoon's lock-in.

3069
02:01:28,970 --> 02:01:29,970
Doki put down lock-in.

3070
02:01:30,090 --> 02:01:31,970
Make it multi-player.

3071
02:01:32,150 --> 02:01:33,510
But that makes it more fun!

3072
02:01:33,770 --> 02:01:35,710
It makes it more fun when it's not password.

3073
02:01:37,530 --> 02:01:39,450
Hey, thank you for the super chat.

3074
02:01:39,690 --> 02:01:39,930
Thank you.

3075
02:01:40,090 --> 02:01:40,410
Thank you.

3076
02:01:40,830 --> 02:01:41,970
Yet can offer no guidance.

3077
02:01:42,990 --> 02:01:43,770
I am no maiden.

3078
02:01:45,070 --> 02:01:46,590
Wait, yes you are?

3079
02:01:47,270 --> 02:01:49,550
I see you for who you are.

3080
02:01:49,870 --> 02:01:50,850
A maiden.

3081
02:01:51,910 --> 02:01:53,270
I see you.

3082
02:01:53,650 --> 02:01:54,490
Don't worry.

3083
02:01:54,490 --> 02:01:55,450
To strength.

3084
02:01:55,870 --> 02:01:58,310
Let my hand rest upon you.

3085
02:01:59,170 --> 02:01:59,890
Oh.

3086
02:02:00,190 --> 02:02:00,630
Okay.

3087
02:02:01,630 --> 02:02:02,730
Share them with me.

3088
02:02:03,070 --> 02:02:03,190
Oh.

3089
02:02:03,610 --> 02:02:03,810
Okay.

3090
02:02:06,150 --> 02:02:06,870
Okay.

3091
02:02:07,510 --> 02:02:08,070
Oh.

3092
02:02:10,050 --> 02:02:10,770
Alright.

3093
02:02:11,930 --> 02:02:12,550
It's time.

3094
02:02:13,310 --> 02:02:15,770
It's time to have my first death.

3095
02:02:16,050 --> 02:02:17,410
She could be our maiden.

3096
02:02:17,830 --> 02:02:19,170
Alright, it's time.

3097
02:02:19,170 --> 02:02:21,310
Have I learned anything?

3098
02:02:22,270 --> 02:02:22,830
Okay.

3099
02:02:23,310 --> 02:02:24,170
To be fair.

3100
02:02:24,810 --> 02:02:27,790
Is it truly my fault if I'm getting enabled?

3101
02:02:28,470 --> 02:02:28,810
Is it?

3102
02:02:36,750 --> 02:02:38,170
Oh, there he is.

3103
02:02:38,350 --> 02:02:40,030
That's the guy my dad kept dying to.

3104
02:02:52,190 --> 02:02:53,770
I'm not foul.

3105
02:02:54,190 --> 02:02:56,330
I'm just cheesing a little bit.

3106
02:03:02,590 --> 02:03:04,110
No, he didn't beat him.

3107
02:03:04,310 --> 02:03:05,170
I beat him.

3108
02:03:05,170 --> 02:03:05,650
The wing will be in a light of the flame.

3109
02:03:06,710 --> 02:03:10,710
Let it be Margaret the fowl.

3110
02:03:13,450 --> 02:03:14,090
Okay.

3111
02:03:15,250 --> 02:03:15,790
Okay.

3112
02:03:17,310 --> 02:03:17,950
Jelly.

3113
02:03:18,130 --> 02:03:18,510
Oh shit.

3114
02:03:18,650 --> 02:03:19,070
Oh fuck.

3115
02:03:19,410 --> 02:03:21,230
I was trying to use my jellyfish.

3116
02:03:21,410 --> 02:03:22,190
Give me a sec.

3117
02:03:23,110 --> 02:03:23,750
Jellyfish.

3118
02:03:27,850 --> 02:03:28,490
Okay.

3119
02:03:28,750 --> 02:03:30,050
I need to know his patterns though.

3120
02:03:32,470 --> 02:03:33,350
Jesus Christ.

3121
02:03:33,590 --> 02:03:33,750
Okay.

3122
02:03:33,750 --> 02:03:33,750
Okay.

3123
02:03:36,790 --> 02:03:37,750
There's a pattern.

3124
02:03:38,310 --> 02:03:39,530
Oh, okay, that's good.

3125
02:03:39,650 --> 02:03:41,050
He just... fights him.

3126
02:03:45,800 --> 02:03:46,280
What?!

3127
02:03:46,280 --> 02:03:46,900
I run!

3128
02:03:48,860 --> 02:03:49,720
Okay, nice.

3129
02:03:52,220 --> 02:03:55,280
Wait, I'm not using... Wait, how am I... Why am I using my arrows?!

3130
02:03:55,280 --> 02:03:56,420
Oh my god, okay.

3131
02:03:57,700 --> 02:03:58,180
Okay.

3132
02:03:59,480 --> 02:04:00,200
That's fine.

3133
02:04:00,440 --> 02:04:01,460
Go, jellyfish!

3134
02:04:01,620 --> 02:04:02,600
Take that shit!

3135
02:04:03,300 --> 02:04:03,820
Take it!

3136
02:04:03,880 --> 02:04:05,080
I'm slowly walking over!

3137
02:04:07,140 --> 02:04:08,080
Oh my god.

3138
02:04:08,500 --> 02:04:09,200
Jesus Christ.

3139
02:04:10,380 --> 02:04:11,640
Okay, that's not good.

3140
02:04:14,960 --> 02:04:16,000
Alright, that's fine.

3141
02:04:18,200 --> 02:04:19,380
Oh my god!

3142
02:04:23,110 --> 02:04:24,250
Oh god, fuck.

3143
02:04:25,070 --> 02:04:25,390
Nice.

3144
02:04:25,510 --> 02:04:26,190
Oh, that's a stagger!

3145
02:04:30,370 --> 02:04:31,330
Oh, no.

3146
02:04:33,450 --> 02:04:34,670
Okay, I got it.

3147
02:04:38,730 --> 02:04:39,290
Okay.

3148
02:04:41,350 --> 02:04:42,190
Okay.

3149
02:04:42,290 --> 02:04:42,610
Okay, nice.

3150
02:04:43,010 --> 02:04:44,270
Go, jellyfish!

3151
02:04:46,030 --> 02:04:46,870
Yes!

3152
02:04:47,510 --> 02:04:48,350
Die for me!

3153
02:04:49,130 --> 02:04:51,270
Die for your... your master!

3154
02:04:51,930 --> 02:04:52,930
Oh shit!

3155
02:04:53,910 --> 02:04:54,510
Keep dying!

3156
02:04:56,550 --> 02:05:02,810
Oh my god, I did not realize the heals for that was... I swear to god!

3157
02:05:04,050 --> 02:05:05,810
Oh my god!

3158
02:05:08,550 --> 02:05:10,110
Oh shit!

3159
02:05:20,030 --> 02:05:20,170
Oh shit!

3160
02:05:21,410 --> 02:05:24,030
Oh my god!

3161
02:05:24,030 --> 02:05:26,730
Oh my god!

3162
02:05:26,730 --> 02:05:26,830
I

3163
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:32,540
can't!

3164
02:05:33,020 --> 02:05:39,220
Okay, don't... Alright, if you'll be alive, you'll drop any runes by the site and die again.

3165
02:05:39,520 --> 02:05:40,500
Okay, we know that.

3166
02:05:40,620 --> 02:05:40,980
Okay, okay.

3167
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:41,940
I'll focus up.

3168
02:05:42,280 --> 02:05:44,760
I... I'll focus up now.

3169
02:05:45,040 --> 02:05:47,300
Okay, I have to, like, figure out his patterns.

3170
02:05:48,580 --> 02:05:49,300
Don't worry.

3171
02:05:51,080 --> 02:05:52,300
Go, jellyfish!

3172
02:05:53,420 --> 02:05:53,940
Ow!

3173
02:05:53,940 --> 02:05:53,960
Ow!

3174
02:05:54,780 --> 02:05:56,040
Where did my runes go?

3175
02:05:57,140 --> 02:05:57,580
Where did my runes go?

3176
02:05:57,580 --> 02:05:58,240
You go do your thing.

3177
02:05:58,400 --> 02:06:00,000
I'm gathering my runes real quick.

3178
02:06:00,900 --> 02:06:01,300
This?

3179
02:06:01,500 --> 02:06:02,060
There it is.

3180
02:06:02,940 --> 02:06:03,820
Alright, here we go.

3181
02:06:05,220 --> 02:06:05,920
Here we go.

3182
02:06:13,140 --> 02:06:14,520
Jesus Christ!

3183
02:06:14,820 --> 02:06:15,020
Okay.

3184
02:06:19,550 --> 02:06:21,730
Okay, I have to figure out the pattern for him.

3185
02:06:22,750 --> 02:06:23,410
Oh, no!

3186
02:06:23,890 --> 02:06:26,650
I need to figure out my... I need to remember my stamina, too.

3187
02:06:29,350 --> 02:06:30,750
Jesus Christ!

3188
02:06:32,130 --> 02:06:33,210
Oh, no!

3189
02:06:34,650 --> 02:06:35,010
No!

3190
02:06:35,010 --> 02:06:35,190
Heal!

3191
02:06:37,050 --> 02:06:38,290
I need to go fast.

3192
02:06:43,360 --> 02:06:43,520
Okay.

3193
02:06:44,520 --> 02:06:47,920
Okay, he's... Oh my god.

3194
02:06:48,300 --> 02:06:48,800
Jesus!

3195
02:06:49,100 --> 02:06:49,840
Oh, where am I?

3196
02:06:51,740 --> 02:06:54,160
I did not, like, spam my bros.

3197
02:06:56,140 --> 02:06:58,260
Makes me want to spam it so bad.

3198
02:07:01,500 --> 02:07:02,120
Oh god.

3199
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:02,920
No.

3200
02:07:03,940 --> 02:07:05,120
Okay, I dodged that.

3201
02:07:08,500 --> 02:07:09,560
Oh my god.

3202
02:07:10,300 --> 02:07:10,780
What?!

3203
02:07:10,780 --> 02:07:13,960
Oh, nice, he's gonna kill my squid.

3204
02:07:15,660 --> 02:07:17,800
Wait, I thought you were focusing on my squid.

3205
02:07:18,100 --> 02:07:18,700
What happened?

3206
02:07:20,240 --> 02:07:21,040
Oh fuck.

3207
02:07:22,320 --> 02:07:23,140
Oh fuck.

3208
02:07:23,440 --> 02:07:25,080
Oh my god, Jesus Christ.

3209
02:07:26,120 --> 02:07:27,240
Okay, I'm okay.

3210
02:07:28,980 --> 02:07:29,900
Are you serious?

3211
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:30,420
Okay, nice.

3212
02:07:30,580 --> 02:07:30,680
Okay.

3213
02:07:36,210 --> 02:07:37,690
Oh my god.

3214
02:07:40,530 --> 02:07:42,350
It's so hard to time the rolls.

3215
02:07:48,710 --> 02:07:50,430
It's always so close.

3216
02:07:51,190 --> 02:07:52,790
Sorry, I meant jellyfish.

3217
02:07:54,350 --> 02:07:54,730
Oh.

3218
02:07:56,510 --> 02:07:58,670
It's so hard to time the rolls.

3219
02:07:59,210 --> 02:08:00,930
Wait, my dev counter's not working.

3220
02:08:01,350 --> 02:08:03,610
What if it just stays there forever?

3221
02:08:06,550 --> 02:08:09,270
Wait, my dev counter actually isn't working.

3222
02:08:09,510 --> 02:08:10,170
I don't understand.

3223
02:08:11,090 --> 02:08:12,910
Maybe it's here.

3224
02:08:14,450 --> 02:08:16,430
How is it still zero devs?

3225
02:08:19,230 --> 02:08:19,730
Oh.

3226
02:08:20,190 --> 02:08:21,070
Okay, now it should work.

3227
02:08:21,770 --> 02:08:22,270
Did it work?

3228
02:08:22,430 --> 02:08:23,050
Oh, there we go.

3229
02:08:23,470 --> 02:08:24,290
Now it should say two.

3230
02:08:28,050 --> 02:08:29,170
There we go.

3231
02:08:29,250 --> 02:08:30,290
There, I fixed it.

3232
02:08:30,850 --> 02:08:31,930
Yeah, I fixed it.

3233
02:08:34,990 --> 02:08:35,690
All right.

3234
02:08:40,200 --> 02:08:41,320
I believe.

3235
02:08:45,290 --> 02:08:47,410
Go jellyfish, go!

3236
02:08:54,100 --> 02:08:54,780
Okay.

3237
02:08:58,550 --> 02:08:59,190
Jesus!

3238
02:08:59,550 --> 02:08:59,810
Okay.

3239
02:09:00,630 --> 02:09:01,290
All right.

3240
02:09:02,710 --> 02:09:04,130
I'll figure this out.

3241
02:09:04,130 --> 02:09:04,130
Oh.

3242
02:09:06,210 --> 02:09:11,190
I think for me, it's more so like his- the rolls is so delayed too sometimes.

3243
02:09:14,910 --> 02:09:16,830
Like, oh, I didn't get roll abs.

3244
02:09:17,010 --> 02:09:19,110
I wanted to like figure out the roll mechanic.

3245
02:09:19,930 --> 02:09:21,430
I was trying to figure it out.

3246
02:09:21,430 --> 02:09:25,430
For these foolish provisions to rest.

3247
02:09:25,670 --> 02:09:27,230
How do you do so much damage?

3248
02:09:27,710 --> 02:09:28,150
I done so much damage!

3249
02:09:33,230 --> 02:09:33,630
Oh.

3250
02:09:34,250 --> 02:09:35,490
you roll on release?

3251
02:09:35,830 --> 02:09:36,590
Not on press?

3252
02:09:37,010 --> 02:09:39,210
Oh, that's... bullshit.

3253
02:09:39,210 --> 02:09:39,430
Shit!

3254
02:09:41,070 --> 02:09:45,010
Oh my god, you roll... Okay, I just realized you roll on release.

3255
02:09:45,270 --> 02:09:48,670
I... I... I just realized.

3256
02:09:49,410 --> 02:09:51,530
I... I just realized.

3257
02:09:52,330 --> 02:09:53,010
Okay.

3258
02:09:54,770 --> 02:09:56,210
Okay, now I know.

3259
02:09:58,850 --> 02:09:59,790
There we go.

3260
02:10:00,390 --> 02:10:01,510
I didn't know that.

3261
02:10:03,930 --> 02:10:04,610
Okay.

3262
02:10:05,870 --> 02:10:06,370
Alright.

3263
02:10:07,010 --> 02:10:07,950
Jellyfish, please!

3264
02:10:09,570 --> 02:10:10,810
He's right here!

3265
02:10:11,110 --> 02:10:11,950
Fight him!

3266
02:10:14,670 --> 02:10:16,550
At least now I know that.

3267
02:10:19,950 --> 02:10:21,970
Jesus, his tail got me.

3268
02:10:24,370 --> 02:10:24,970
Okay.

3269
02:10:26,090 --> 02:10:27,370
His tail got me.

3270
02:10:29,470 --> 02:10:30,790
Oh my god.

3271
02:10:34,640 --> 02:10:36,780
Oh, I forgot to pick up my thing.

3272
02:10:37,060 --> 02:10:37,780
But it doesn't matter.

3273
02:10:37,980 --> 02:10:38,300
Anyway.

3274
02:10:42,420 --> 02:10:43,180
Okay, nice.

3275
02:10:44,580 --> 02:10:45,500
Oh my god.

3276
02:10:45,660 --> 02:10:46,380
I didn't know this attack.

3277
02:10:46,820 --> 02:10:47,740
I didn't know yet.

3278
02:10:49,320 --> 02:10:51,420
What the fuck?!

3279
02:10:57,780 --> 02:11:02,580
I will land!

3280
02:11:03,160 --> 02:11:04,720
I will land!

3281
02:11:09,630 --> 02:11:10,410
I will land!

3282
02:11:10,410 --> 02:11:10,530
I will land!

3283
02:11:10,590 --> 02:11:12,050
I don't need the free summon.

3284
02:11:12,310 --> 02:11:13,270
I don't need him.

3285
02:11:14,170 --> 02:11:17,750
I could do... I just need my good old Val Jellyfish.

3286
02:11:19,770 --> 02:11:20,390
Jellyfish!

3287
02:11:20,450 --> 02:11:20,450
Jellyfish!

3288
02:11:21,690 --> 02:11:24,470
Well, I lost my streamer build, but I don't want to abuse it more.

3289
02:11:26,450 --> 02:11:32,210
I'm trying... I'm not... Look, I'm trying to not abuse it too much.

3290
02:11:32,350 --> 02:11:32,690
Okay?

3291
02:11:33,050 --> 02:11:36,870
We almost first try with it and I realized how broken it was.

3292
02:11:39,790 --> 02:11:45,470
I realized... It was very broken, so I'm trying not to abuse that shit.

3293
02:11:49,070 --> 02:11:50,490
I literally... Oh, I fuck!

3294
02:11:50,630 --> 02:11:51,890
I fuck air suppressor!

3295
02:11:52,110 --> 02:11:52,970
I don't know why!

3296
02:11:53,170 --> 02:11:55,250
I was like, I need to reload my sword.

3297
02:12:02,730 --> 02:12:03,170
Okay.

3298
02:12:03,170 --> 02:12:04,090
I don't know why.

3299
02:12:04,230 --> 02:12:05,910
I was like, time to reload my sword.

3300
02:12:05,910 --> 02:12:05,910
I don't know why.

3301
02:12:06,030 --> 02:12:06,030
I don't know why.

3302
02:12:06,030 --> 02:12:06,030
I don't know why.

3303
02:12:06,030 --> 02:12:06,030
I don't need to reload my sword.

3304
02:12:08,230 --> 02:12:08,530
Hmm.

3305
02:12:11,870 --> 02:12:12,470
Okay.

3306
02:12:13,530 --> 02:12:14,690
I did it!

3307
02:12:18,570 --> 02:12:19,410
OMG I did IT!

3308
02:12:20,010 --> 02:12:21,310
I did the thing!

3309
02:12:22,790 --> 02:12:24,330
Oh my god, I leave now!

3310
02:12:27,030 --> 02:12:27,390
Okay.

3311
02:12:27,490 --> 02:12:31,170
Okay, nice.

3312
02:12:36,510 --> 02:12:37,970
God damn it, not nice.

3313
02:12:38,330 --> 02:12:39,270
Not nice.

3314
02:12:39,410 --> 02:12:39,930
Not nice.

3315
02:12:40,970 --> 02:12:42,210
Not nice.

3316
02:12:44,930 --> 02:12:45,830
Okay, nice.

3317
02:12:48,800 --> 02:12:50,240
Jesus Christ.

3318
02:12:52,080 --> 02:12:52,780
Okay.

3319
02:12:53,300 --> 02:12:54,260
Oh, what?

3320
02:12:56,320 --> 02:12:56,800
Nice.

3321
02:12:57,180 --> 02:12:57,520
For me.

3322
02:13:03,060 --> 02:13:03,680
Jesus.

3323
02:13:09,390 --> 02:13:11,250
Oh my god, how many?

3324
02:13:13,510 --> 02:13:14,110
For me.

3325
02:13:14,650 --> 02:13:15,070
Oh.

3326
02:13:18,270 --> 02:13:18,910
No!

3327
02:13:19,050 --> 02:13:19,430
I don't know.

3328
02:13:19,570 --> 02:13:21,170
I thought it would be cool when I jumped.

3329
02:13:21,590 --> 02:13:22,390
I really did.

3330
02:13:24,250 --> 02:13:24,890
No!

3331
02:13:26,410 --> 02:13:27,050
No!

3332
02:13:27,210 --> 02:13:28,690
You're pressing the wrong time!

3333
02:13:32,690 --> 02:13:36,530
I rolled backwards instead of right side.

3334
02:13:37,970 --> 02:13:38,610
No!

3335
02:13:40,770 --> 02:13:43,610
I was like, let me roll backwards.

3336
02:13:43,610 --> 02:13:45,110
That's how you do it.

3337
02:13:46,090 --> 02:13:49,290
I got two appraisals off the bat too.

3338
02:13:53,170 --> 02:13:53,730
Jellyfish!

3339
02:13:54,230 --> 02:13:56,290
We can do this, you and me.

3340
02:13:57,010 --> 02:14:00,890
I'll just do this entire run with just jellyfish summons too.

3341
02:14:01,050 --> 02:14:02,250
That's how much I'm gonna gain.

3342
02:14:02,910 --> 02:14:03,290
Guys.

3343
02:14:05,870 --> 02:14:08,350
This is gonna be a jellyfish only run.

3344
02:14:14,370 --> 02:14:15,790
I can do it.

3345
02:14:17,270 --> 02:14:17,620
Face.

3346
02:14:18,550 --> 02:14:19,250
Jelly buddy.

3347
02:14:19,870 --> 02:14:22,650
I think I can do a jellyfish only run.

3348
02:14:23,110 --> 02:14:24,270
That's possible.

3349
02:14:26,470 --> 02:14:27,170
Spongebob.

3350
02:14:27,170 --> 02:14:27,730
I can do it.

3351
02:14:31,350 --> 02:14:32,550
Oh, shit!

3352
02:14:34,850 --> 02:14:36,350
My jelly bro.

3353
02:14:40,110 --> 02:14:42,050
He's like 2.5 for me.

3354
02:14:42,170 --> 02:14:57,150
Warrior loves to have a�ehman.

3355
02:14:58,070 --> 02:14:59,990
Jesus, that's actually cheating.

3356
02:15:07,650 --> 02:15:10,750
Oh my god, I don't think my bro is having a good time right now.

3357
02:15:13,190 --> 02:15:13,830
Okay.

3358
02:15:16,150 --> 02:15:16,970
Oh no.

3359
02:15:18,890 --> 02:15:19,530
No.

3360
02:15:19,870 --> 02:15:21,010
Roll, keep rolling!

3361
02:15:25,110 --> 02:15:26,010
It's okay.

3362
02:15:28,050 --> 02:15:28,690
Alright.

3363
02:15:30,090 --> 02:15:32,870
Jesus Christ, this stupid little dagger shit.

3364
02:15:43,440 --> 02:15:43,820
Rolling!

3365
02:15:50,640 --> 02:15:52,220
Stupid delay attack.

3366
02:15:54,520 --> 02:15:55,360
Jesus.

3367
02:15:58,300 --> 02:15:58,720
Okay.

3368
02:16:01,240 --> 02:16:02,180
Oh my god.

3369
02:16:03,540 --> 02:16:06,340
But, yes, you can keep rolling.

3370
02:16:07,260 --> 02:16:09,940
But what if I kept tired from rolling?

3371
02:16:15,480 --> 02:16:16,100
Yes!

3372
02:16:16,340 --> 02:16:17,400
Let's go!

3373
02:16:18,440 --> 02:16:19,980
Let's fucking go!

3374
02:16:20,860 --> 02:16:22,640
Just keep rolling.

3375
02:16:23,580 --> 02:16:25,000
Oh my god, we did it.

3376
02:16:25,440 --> 02:16:26,600
We did it.

3377
02:16:27,220 --> 02:16:27,960
See, guys.

3378
02:16:28,960 --> 02:16:31,860
I don't abuse my content creator.

3379
02:16:32,480 --> 02:16:34,800
My content creator build that much.

3380
02:16:34,800 --> 02:16:37,000
Fear of the night.

3381
02:16:37,240 --> 02:16:37,700
Alright.

3382
02:16:37,980 --> 02:16:38,540
Nice.

3383
02:16:42,740 --> 02:16:43,700
First try.

3384
02:16:44,440 --> 02:16:45,360
Hello, I did it.

3385
02:16:45,420 --> 02:16:46,260
Are you proud of me?

3386
02:17:05,760 --> 02:17:06,920
I've been...

3387
02:17:06,920 --> 02:17:07,740
Thank you for the super chat.

3388
02:17:07,840 --> 02:17:08,120
Thank you.

3389
02:17:08,220 --> 02:17:08,660
Thank you.

3390
02:17:08,820 --> 02:17:09,880
There is but one other thing.

3391
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:11,060
But what is it?

3392
02:17:11,280 --> 02:17:12,000
I can do to offer you guidance.

3393
02:17:13,040 --> 02:17:15,280
I can take you to the round table hole.

3394
02:17:16,080 --> 02:17:16,960
Gathering place.

3395
02:17:17,620 --> 02:17:19,060
Of tarnished champions.

3396
02:17:20,400 --> 02:17:20,840
Guided.

3397
02:17:21,380 --> 02:17:22,160
By grace.

3398
02:17:24,500 --> 02:17:24,840
Oh?

3399
02:17:25,020 --> 02:17:25,420
Very well.

3400
02:17:25,880 --> 02:17:26,840
What is this place?

3401
02:17:26,920 --> 02:17:27,720
Let my hand rest upon you.

3402
02:17:28,400 --> 02:17:29,480
For but a moment.

3403
02:17:29,660 --> 02:17:31,020
Next thing, thank you for the super chat.

3404
02:17:31,020 --> 02:17:31,660
I think, thank you.

3405
02:17:31,780 --> 02:17:32,260
Not gonna lie.

3406
02:17:32,380 --> 02:17:34,140
I thought you'd be stuck here longer.

3407
02:17:34,600 --> 02:17:35,080
Nice.

3408
02:17:35,420 --> 02:17:36,300
Nice job.

3409
02:17:37,120 --> 02:17:38,180
I did it.

3410
02:17:38,340 --> 02:17:39,460
We did it, guys.

3411
02:17:39,760 --> 02:17:41,200
This was a group effort.

3412
02:17:43,840 --> 02:17:45,660
Oh, there's a place where tarnished gathered.

3413
02:17:45,840 --> 02:17:46,620
Guided by grace.

3414
02:17:47,320 --> 02:17:50,240
I bet I'm, like, raising the player count right now.

3415
02:17:50,480 --> 02:17:52,040
What was this build?

3416
02:17:53,820 --> 02:17:58,520
I have, like, so many tragoons just chilling at the messages right now.

3417
02:18:03,460 --> 02:18:03,940
Like...

3418
02:18:03,940 --> 02:18:05,640
Combust parade on the premise.

3419
02:18:06,380 --> 02:18:06,860
And...

3420
02:18:06,860 --> 02:18:09,020
Do a pack of non-aggression.

3421
02:18:09,900 --> 02:18:10,240
Um...

3422
02:18:10,240 --> 02:18:12,100
The round tell you behold is located outside.

3423
02:18:12,440 --> 02:18:14,160
And fast travel grace is the only means.

3424
02:18:14,280 --> 02:18:15,660
Use the map to travel there.

3425
02:18:15,740 --> 02:18:16,200
What's this?

3426
02:18:17,340 --> 02:18:18,560
I have an army.

3427
02:18:18,920 --> 02:18:19,400
Press.

3428
02:18:22,800 --> 02:18:23,280
Oh!

3429
02:18:23,700 --> 02:18:25,260
I mean, I can level up right now, right?

3430
02:18:25,440 --> 02:18:26,800
So we just max out to 20.

3431
02:18:26,980 --> 02:18:27,400
Wait!

3432
02:18:27,700 --> 02:18:29,040
Can I max out to 20 already?

3433
02:18:33,130 --> 02:18:34,730
Oh my god, how much did I have?

3434
02:18:34,850 --> 02:18:35,750
Oh, that's a lot!

3435
02:18:39,290 --> 02:18:43,770
My respect for you will go extremely high if you also use Aurelia as your only summon.

3436
02:18:44,090 --> 02:18:47,390
Also, you can check the full description of all items by pressing R on the keyboard.

3437
02:18:48,770 --> 02:18:50,110
Uh, thank you to the super chat.

3438
02:18:50,250 --> 02:18:51,550
Thank you, thank you, Cenk.

3439
02:18:51,550 --> 02:18:52,150
That's right.

3440
02:18:52,170 --> 02:18:52,590
That's right.

3441
02:18:52,590 --> 02:18:53,730
We'll only do...

3442
02:18:53,730 --> 02:18:55,830
We'll only do jellyfish run.

3443
02:19:00,860 --> 02:19:02,510
This is a jellyfish only run.

3444
02:19:02,870 --> 02:19:04,910
This is a jellyfish content creator build.

3445
02:19:05,890 --> 02:19:07,550
It only makes sense!

3446
02:19:07,690 --> 02:19:10,930
I don't really need summons when I just have messages.

3447
02:19:10,930 --> 02:19:12,190
Like...

3448
02:19:12,750 --> 02:19:13,370
And I...

3449
02:19:13,370 --> 02:19:15,230
And I have, like, messages.

3450
02:19:15,950 --> 02:19:16,230
Okay.

3451
02:19:16,670 --> 02:19:18,790
Going for endurance and...

3452
02:19:19,810 --> 02:19:21,970
Endurance and dexterity?

3453
02:19:28,190 --> 02:19:29,450
My jellybro.

3454
02:19:33,410 --> 02:19:35,110
Why are you mad, huh?

3455
02:19:35,470 --> 02:19:36,410
Why are you mad?

3456
02:19:37,070 --> 02:19:38,950
Did I wake you up because I was screaming?

3457
02:19:39,870 --> 02:19:41,230
That's on you for sleeping here.

3458
02:19:41,230 --> 02:19:41,730
Oh my god.

3459
02:19:45,410 --> 02:19:47,450
Even he is ready to fight.

3460
02:19:47,750 --> 02:19:48,750
Here, thank you for the super chat.

3461
02:19:48,910 --> 02:19:49,850
Thank you, thank you.

3462
02:19:50,930 --> 02:19:51,650
This guy beat...

3463
02:19:51,650 --> 02:19:52,550
Yeah, I beat Tree Center.

3464
02:19:52,830 --> 02:19:53,030
Yeah!

3465
02:19:53,330 --> 02:19:54,910
And I didn't abuse level ups.

3466
02:19:55,290 --> 02:19:56,170
I just fought.

3467
02:19:56,310 --> 02:19:57,470
I just went straight for him.

3468
02:19:58,690 --> 02:19:59,490
All me.

3469
02:20:02,570 --> 02:20:03,930
Can I level anything up?

3470
02:20:04,030 --> 02:20:04,550
Okay, here we go.

3471
02:20:05,750 --> 02:20:05,950
Alright.

3472
02:20:08,190 --> 02:20:09,230
What can I do here?

3473
02:20:10,610 --> 02:20:11,110
Hello.

3474
02:20:11,450 --> 02:20:13,310
Oh, I see you've just arrived.

3475
02:20:14,030 --> 02:20:15,730
Welcome to the round table hold.

3476
02:20:16,710 --> 02:20:18,970
I'm Corrin, a man of the cloth.

3477
02:20:19,250 --> 02:20:19,870
Oh, he's not...

3478
02:20:19,870 --> 02:20:20,590
Oh wait, Margaret.

3479
02:20:20,890 --> 02:20:21,510
Oh yes, sorry.

3480
02:20:21,610 --> 02:20:22,210
I meant Margaret.

3481
02:20:22,890 --> 02:20:24,450
Granted us by the two fingers.

3482
02:20:24,730 --> 02:20:27,590
And explore the secrets of the golden order.

3483
02:20:28,010 --> 02:20:33,810
So that one day, if a tarnished of the round table hold should become Elden Lord.

3484
02:20:34,050 --> 02:20:34,350
Huh?

3485
02:20:34,350 --> 02:20:36,050
I might counsel them.

3486
02:20:36,650 --> 02:20:39,450
Ensuring order regains its proper form.

3487
02:20:39,630 --> 02:20:41,390
Why are you locked up, bro?

3488
02:20:41,490 --> 02:20:41,750
Lighting rule over men.

3489
02:20:42,450 --> 02:20:45,250
By the way, do you still see it?

3490
02:20:46,230 --> 02:20:47,950
The guidance of grace.

3491
02:20:48,730 --> 02:20:50,450
Raven, well, thank you for...

3492
02:20:50,450 --> 02:20:52,130
Yeah, I see it.

3493
02:20:53,010 --> 02:20:54,110
Oh, is it the yellow thing?

3494
02:20:54,110 --> 02:20:57,230
You, most tarnished are blind to it these days.

3495
02:20:57,590 --> 02:21:00,030
You are something of a rare breed.

3496
02:21:00,590 --> 02:21:02,350
Well, what do you say?

3497
02:21:02,990 --> 02:21:05,670
Care to learn an incantation of the two fingers?

3498
02:21:06,490 --> 02:21:08,010
The two fingers?

3499
02:21:08,290 --> 02:21:08,510
Okay.

3500
02:21:09,130 --> 02:21:10,090
Bro, that's kinky.

3501
02:21:10,290 --> 02:21:10,490
Alright.

3502
02:21:13,210 --> 02:21:13,850
Okay.

3503
02:21:14,770 --> 02:21:17,250
It has a small amount of HP.

3504
02:21:17,610 --> 02:21:18,730
Cures poison.

3505
02:21:19,190 --> 02:21:19,890
Catch flame.

3506
02:21:24,370 --> 02:21:25,850
Oh, he teaches magic.

3507
02:21:26,210 --> 02:21:27,330
I don't need this, right?

3508
02:21:27,970 --> 02:21:28,430
We don't...

3509
02:21:28,430 --> 02:21:28,710
We don't...

3510
02:21:28,710 --> 02:21:29,650
We're not magic users.

3511
02:21:30,830 --> 02:21:32,190
But we don't really need it.

3512
02:21:36,870 --> 02:21:37,830
We don't really need it.

3513
02:21:37,830 --> 02:21:39,290
Do anyone I have to talk to?

3514
02:21:45,770 --> 02:21:46,730
Hello, Diallos.

3515
02:21:46,730 --> 02:21:49,290
One of one's house holds little import in these lands.

3516
02:21:49,650 --> 02:21:50,710
By the way...

3517
02:21:51,190 --> 02:21:53,610
Have you met a young woman named Lanya on your travels?

3518
02:21:54,030 --> 02:21:55,030
She's my servant.

3519
02:21:55,570 --> 02:21:56,910
But fickle as the wind.

3520
02:21:57,270 --> 02:22:00,370
Take your eyes off her for but a moment and she's good as gone.

3521
02:22:00,930 --> 02:22:02,490
If you find her...

3522
02:22:02,490 --> 02:22:03,930
Please be sure to tell me.

3523
02:22:05,470 --> 02:22:05,930
Okay.

3524
02:22:08,530 --> 02:22:08,990
Oh.

3525
02:22:09,750 --> 02:22:11,130
Guess I can never read that.

3526
02:22:12,770 --> 02:22:13,990
I wanna read this.

3527
02:22:14,150 --> 02:22:15,690
Why would you put it up on the chair?

3528
02:22:15,690 --> 02:22:18,510
Ah, regret.

3529
02:22:19,550 --> 02:22:20,090
Why?

3530
02:22:23,150 --> 02:22:24,550
First off...

3531
02:22:24,850 --> 02:22:25,550
Fingered...

3532
02:22:26,570 --> 02:22:27,130
Wait.

3533
02:22:28,070 --> 02:22:29,170
Let's see.

3534
02:22:29,930 --> 02:22:30,630
Messages.

3535
02:22:38,620 --> 02:22:40,500
No, Hen.

3536
02:22:46,720 --> 02:22:47,640
Who are you?

3537
02:22:48,140 --> 02:22:49,740
Oh, this is a rare occasion.

3538
02:22:50,280 --> 02:22:54,940
I can't remember the last time a new Tarnished made their way to the round table.

3539
02:22:55,440 --> 02:22:56,080
Very well.

3540
02:22:57,100 --> 02:22:59,340
As your senior...

3541
02:23:00,040 --> 02:23:00,860
No head?

3542
02:23:01,580 --> 02:23:02,780
It is safe here.

3543
02:23:03,400 --> 02:23:05,680
You may let down your guard.

3544
02:23:08,020 --> 02:23:09,480
Zyko, thank you for the super chat.

3545
02:23:09,640 --> 02:23:09,860
Thank you.

3546
02:23:10,020 --> 02:23:10,600
Thank you.

3547
02:23:11,220 --> 02:23:14,020
Top cap for vigor is 40.

3548
02:23:14,220 --> 02:23:15,260
Hard cap is 60.

3549
02:23:15,560 --> 02:23:16,720
Praise the fingers.

3550
02:23:17,160 --> 02:23:18,420
Okay, we'll go there soon.

3551
02:23:19,880 --> 02:23:20,440
Alright.

3552
02:23:21,340 --> 02:23:22,300
What else is this?

3553
02:23:22,340 --> 02:23:22,740
They're here.

3554
02:23:24,480 --> 02:23:25,240
What's this?

3555
02:23:26,140 --> 02:23:26,560
Door.

3556
02:23:27,240 --> 02:23:27,740
Door.

3557
02:23:32,590 --> 02:23:33,370
What's wrong?

3558
02:23:34,070 --> 02:23:34,930
What do you want?

3559
02:23:36,850 --> 02:23:37,610
Okay.

3560
02:23:39,370 --> 02:23:40,030
What's that?

3561
02:23:40,370 --> 02:23:41,710
Be wary of dung.

3562
02:23:42,410 --> 02:23:44,290
Didn't expect a lovable sword.

3563
02:23:44,630 --> 02:23:45,030
What?

3564
02:23:45,350 --> 02:23:46,330
What are these?

3565
02:23:50,120 --> 02:23:51,920
He's just an edgelord?

3566
02:23:52,300 --> 02:23:52,500
Ooh.

3567
02:23:53,060 --> 02:23:54,360
Should I buy anything or no?

3568
02:23:55,420 --> 02:23:57,760
Answers request for summoning from hunters.

3569
02:23:57,760 --> 02:24:00,400
When invaded, request the aid of...

3570
02:24:03,510 --> 02:24:04,710
For summoning...

3571
02:24:04,710 --> 02:24:04,830
Yeah.

3572
02:24:06,390 --> 02:24:07,770
Should I buy anything or no?

3573
02:24:09,590 --> 02:24:10,190
Shop?

3574
02:24:10,490 --> 02:24:12,910
Yeah, but should I buy anything in the shop or no?

3575
02:24:14,190 --> 02:24:15,510
What's the bell bearing?

3576
02:24:17,670 --> 02:24:19,470
Oh, are these PvP items?

3577
02:24:19,470 --> 02:24:20,170
Oh.

3578
02:24:22,630 --> 02:24:23,170
Oh.

3579
02:24:28,290 --> 02:24:29,130
I see.

3580
02:24:30,390 --> 02:24:32,190
Try finger butthole.

3581
02:24:32,810 --> 02:24:33,310
Dark, thank you.

3582
02:24:33,430 --> 02:24:34,550
Super shopping thing.

3583
02:24:34,910 --> 02:24:35,010
Thank you.

3584
02:24:39,210 --> 02:24:39,480
Okay.

3585
02:24:40,040 --> 02:24:41,920
Oh, bell bearings opens new shop items?

3586
02:24:42,200 --> 02:24:43,500
Should I...

3587
02:24:46,580 --> 02:24:47,700
Should I give it to them?

3588
02:24:47,780 --> 02:24:48,360
Do I have any?

3589
02:24:48,620 --> 02:24:50,060
Oh, I don't have any.

3590
02:24:50,400 --> 02:24:51,060
Okay, never mind.

3591
02:24:51,320 --> 02:24:51,640
Goodbye.

3592
02:24:54,620 --> 02:24:55,080
Goodbye.

3593
02:24:55,080 --> 02:24:55,220
Goodbye.

3594
02:24:55,780 --> 02:24:56,980
I don't have anything.

3595
02:24:58,720 --> 02:25:01,000
I like how they offer it to me.

3596
02:25:01,620 --> 02:25:04,020
I feel like if I don't have any, it shouldn't show up.

3597
02:25:06,180 --> 02:25:06,920
Wait, what?

3598
02:25:14,740 --> 02:25:16,520
Why is it always suffering?

3599
02:25:26,170 --> 02:25:29,090
Okay, if I'm jumping down, I'm putting a message down.

3600
02:25:36,670 --> 02:25:37,490
I'm putting...

3601
02:25:37,490 --> 02:25:38,870
If I...

3602
02:25:38,870 --> 02:25:40,850
Time for healing.

3603
02:25:43,590 --> 02:25:44,750
If you're gonna...

3604
02:25:44,750 --> 02:25:45,170
If you're gonna...

3605
02:25:45,170 --> 02:25:49,990
I'm just saying, if you're gonna fucking make me jump, I'm fucking putting a message.

3606
02:25:50,350 --> 02:25:51,050
Like...

3607
02:25:51,050 --> 02:25:52,170
This is on you.

3608
02:25:54,390 --> 02:25:55,090
Message.

3609
02:25:55,090 --> 02:25:55,970
Message.

3610
02:25:58,830 --> 02:26:00,270
Time for healing.

3611
02:26:05,350 --> 02:26:06,110
Jesus.

3612
02:26:18,370 --> 02:26:19,790
Here we go.

3613
02:26:24,040 --> 02:26:24,800
Oh.

3614
02:26:25,840 --> 02:26:26,880
He looks mad.

3615
02:26:28,320 --> 02:26:30,360
Wait, I can't summon a jellyfish.

3616
02:26:31,160 --> 02:26:31,720
Wait.

3617
02:26:31,980 --> 02:26:32,440
Wait, wait, wait.

3618
02:26:32,600 --> 02:26:33,260
I fucked up.

3619
02:26:34,580 --> 02:26:35,180
Wait.

3620
02:26:36,620 --> 02:26:38,080
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3621
02:26:38,220 --> 02:26:40,420
Why can't I...

3622
02:26:41,200 --> 02:26:41,940
What the...

3623
02:26:41,940 --> 02:26:42,960
What the fuck?

3624
02:26:54,380 --> 02:26:55,620
Okay, guys.

3625
02:26:56,180 --> 02:26:57,960
Okay, you fuckers.

3626
02:26:57,960 --> 02:27:10,660
What the hell?

3627
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:15,460
Message was a, message was a freeze.

3628
02:27:15,800 --> 02:27:17,940
Okay, you fucks.

3629
02:27:22,800 --> 02:27:24,260
I'll do one more.

3630
02:27:26,100 --> 02:27:28,300
I'll do one more try.

3631
02:27:29,420 --> 02:27:30,560
Thanks, guys.

3632
02:27:30,980 --> 02:27:33,540
Thanks for the message of praise, guys.

3633
02:27:33,980 --> 02:27:34,520
Thanks.

3634
02:27:34,520 --> 02:27:36,540
I really appreciate it.

3635
02:27:36,680 --> 02:27:39,160
I appreciate the appraisal.

3636
02:27:39,760 --> 02:27:41,140
You guys did it.

3637
02:27:41,580 --> 02:27:47,920
You guys... Thanks, guys.

3638
02:27:53,180 --> 02:27:53,900
Thanks.

3639
02:27:53,900 --> 02:27:54,620
Alright.

3640
02:28:04,020 --> 02:28:07,180
I don't think I'm strong enough for him.

3641
02:28:07,680 --> 02:28:11,480
We're trying to die in the more convenient way.

3642
02:28:15,400 --> 02:28:17,820
I guess I don't... Oh, wait.

3643
02:28:17,880 --> 02:28:19,020
My depth doesn't count.

3644
02:28:19,300 --> 02:28:20,040
I just realized.

3645
02:28:21,260 --> 02:28:22,740
My... Yeah.

3646
02:28:23,180 --> 02:28:24,640
My depth doesn't count for him.

3647
02:28:24,820 --> 02:28:25,380
Yippee!

3648
02:28:30,640 --> 02:28:31,380
Yay!

3649
02:28:31,380 --> 02:28:33,540
My depth doesn't count.

3650
02:28:36,700 --> 02:28:37,440
Yippee!

3651
02:28:37,840 --> 02:28:39,280
Technically, I didn't die.

3652
02:28:44,480 --> 02:28:46,700
No two-handed head.

3653
02:28:47,260 --> 02:28:47,820
What?

3654
02:28:50,540 --> 02:28:51,740
A little sword ahead.

3655
02:28:52,080 --> 02:28:52,700
My new face.

3656
02:28:53,660 --> 02:28:54,440
No matter.

3657
02:28:54,920 --> 02:28:55,980
It's all the same.

3658
02:28:58,160 --> 02:28:59,480
Lay out your arms.

3659
02:29:00,180 --> 02:29:01,740
Let's get smithing.

3660
02:29:01,980 --> 02:29:02,100
What?

3661
02:29:03,260 --> 02:29:05,120
Strength in armament?

3662
02:29:06,280 --> 02:29:07,760
Oh, I don't have the money.

3663
02:29:08,080 --> 02:29:08,760
Because I died.

3664
02:29:10,740 --> 02:29:12,900
Boss's blood loss buildup.

3665
02:29:12,900 --> 02:29:15,880
Do I even upgrade anything?

3666
02:29:16,360 --> 02:29:17,640
I see you've noticed the chains.

3667
02:29:18,300 --> 02:29:19,160
Nothing special.

3668
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,320
I'm a prisoner and these are my chains.

3669
02:29:23,050 --> 02:29:24,700
I'm trapped by the hold.

3670
02:29:25,100 --> 02:29:28,040
I'm dying smithing for you fools.

3671
02:29:29,500 --> 02:29:30,780
That's all there is to it.

3672
02:29:32,900 --> 02:29:33,600
Sell?

3673
02:29:33,920 --> 02:29:34,760
What do I sell?

3674
02:29:34,940 --> 02:29:35,960
I have so much stuff.

3675
02:29:39,690 --> 02:29:41,790
I don't even know what to sell.

3676
02:29:45,220 --> 02:29:46,200
Oh, do I sell?

3677
02:29:46,300 --> 02:29:47,220
Maybe I should sell equipment.

3678
02:29:51,060 --> 02:29:51,700
Uh...

3679
02:29:51,700 --> 02:29:54,880
I don't even know what my equipment is right now.

3680
02:29:55,160 --> 02:29:55,760
Helmet.

3681
02:29:56,080 --> 02:29:57,340
3.1.

3682
02:29:58,460 --> 02:29:59,100
Wait.

3683
02:29:59,460 --> 02:30:00,560
Should I change my outfit?

3684
02:30:02,480 --> 02:30:04,360
Do I have golden runes?

3685
02:30:05,080 --> 02:30:05,920
Rune fragment.

3686
02:30:05,920 --> 02:30:06,640
I have this.

3687
02:30:10,120 --> 02:30:11,260
This is super weird.

3688
02:30:11,320 --> 02:30:12,100
So I'll just sell these.

3689
02:30:12,280 --> 02:30:13,740
Because I have two of the same.

3690
02:30:17,460 --> 02:30:18,240
Let's see.

3691
02:30:18,500 --> 02:30:19,400
Oh, I should sort it.

3692
02:30:20,240 --> 02:30:21,760
Sort by item type.

3693
02:30:26,710 --> 02:30:27,470
There we go.

3694
02:30:30,130 --> 02:30:30,670
Uh...

3695
02:30:30,670 --> 02:30:33,330
I'm just selling these guys.

3696
02:30:33,670 --> 02:30:34,230
For now.

3697
02:30:35,270 --> 02:30:36,150
Because I have the same.

3698
02:30:40,010 --> 02:30:41,430
Any gold runes?

3699
02:30:41,550 --> 02:30:42,650
Do I have gold runes?

3700
02:30:42,770 --> 02:30:43,130
This one?

3701
02:30:51,070 --> 02:30:51,610
Okay.

3702
02:30:52,250 --> 02:30:53,350
They're not anything, right?

3703
02:30:54,050 --> 02:30:55,730
They're not anything important, right?

3704
02:30:56,550 --> 02:30:57,790
Envy, thank you for the super chat.

3705
02:30:57,930 --> 02:30:58,210
Thank you.

3706
02:30:58,470 --> 02:30:58,890
Thank you.

3707
02:31:00,450 --> 02:31:01,750
Alright, I'll just sell them.

3708
02:31:03,310 --> 02:31:03,850
Okay.

3709
02:31:08,690 --> 02:31:10,710
Should be able to afford strength then.

3710
02:31:11,170 --> 02:31:13,050
Is it worth strengthening my sword right now?

3711
02:31:14,130 --> 02:31:15,010
Or what?

3712
02:31:16,190 --> 02:31:17,790
Or should I just...

3713
02:31:17,790 --> 02:31:19,370
Try and find...

3714
02:31:19,370 --> 02:31:19,530
Yeah?

3715
02:31:20,870 --> 02:31:22,250
Okay, I'll strengthen.

3716
02:31:26,270 --> 02:31:26,890
Okay.

3717
02:31:29,550 --> 02:31:30,690
Additional item?

3718
02:31:30,970 --> 02:31:31,730
What do I need?

3719
02:31:33,570 --> 02:31:35,130
Oh, that ash is a war.

3720
02:31:36,370 --> 02:31:37,450
Oh, that ash is a war.

3721
02:31:37,670 --> 02:31:39,670
Oh, that ash is a war.

3722
02:31:40,150 --> 02:31:40,870
Or nah.

3723
02:31:47,590 --> 02:31:48,070
Nah?

3724
02:31:50,930 --> 02:31:51,790
I don't know.

3725
02:31:52,250 --> 02:31:54,270
I don't know if I have any.

3726
02:31:55,450 --> 02:31:56,190
Oh, okay.

3727
02:31:56,310 --> 02:31:56,810
I don't.

3728
02:31:58,090 --> 02:31:59,050
That shit.

3729
02:32:00,050 --> 02:32:00,690
No.

3730
02:32:01,310 --> 02:32:02,810
Don't read too much into it.

3731
02:32:03,050 --> 02:32:04,730
I have no grudge against you.

3732
02:32:05,570 --> 02:32:07,930
My being a prisoner is no fault of yours.

3733
02:32:08,730 --> 02:32:11,590
Besides, I don't mind smithing.

3734
02:32:11,970 --> 02:32:15,790
Despite my differences, the weapons get stronger all the same.

3735
02:32:16,610 --> 02:32:17,650
Even time.

3736
02:32:19,130 --> 02:32:20,630
Technique never fails.

3737
02:32:21,510 --> 02:32:23,350
Besides, it helps me forget...

3738
02:32:24,870 --> 02:32:27,350
The sheer terror of her.

3739
02:32:27,470 --> 02:32:27,930
Who's her?

3740
02:32:28,330 --> 02:32:29,070
Who is she?

3741
02:32:30,750 --> 02:32:32,190
I don't know who she is.

3742
02:32:32,470 --> 02:32:33,530
You won't tell me.

3743
02:32:33,750 --> 02:32:34,230
Oops, sorry.

3744
02:32:34,350 --> 02:32:35,210
I have to tab up.

3745
02:32:36,150 --> 02:32:43,790
My GoXLR has this issue where, like, if I mute myself and I go unmute, it, like, sometimes lowers itself's...

3746
02:32:43,790 --> 02:32:44,430
its volume.

3747
02:32:45,010 --> 02:32:47,030
So I have to, like, re-up it.

3748
02:32:48,050 --> 02:32:48,510
Okay.

3749
02:32:52,070 --> 02:32:53,190
It's over here.

3750
02:32:54,090 --> 02:32:55,010
Behold, hero.

3751
02:32:56,450 --> 02:32:57,470
Is that a maiden?

3752
02:32:58,010 --> 02:32:59,230
Still no behind.

3753
02:33:00,330 --> 02:33:00,970
Look!

3754
02:33:02,110 --> 02:33:03,350
Another one.

3755
02:33:10,230 --> 02:33:12,810
If only I had...

3756
02:33:15,790 --> 02:33:18,410
If only I had a lover.

3757
02:33:20,430 --> 02:33:21,190
Wait.

3758
02:33:21,570 --> 02:33:23,230
I can do a gesture, right?

3759
02:33:23,630 --> 02:33:25,350
I can do a gesture with that, right?

3760
02:33:25,790 --> 02:33:29,690
If only I had...

3761
02:33:30,650 --> 02:33:31,450
A lover.

3762
02:33:31,710 --> 02:33:32,290
And then...

3763
02:33:32,290 --> 02:33:35,930
Why do I put a gesture?

3764
02:33:36,410 --> 02:33:36,970
I need...

3765
02:33:36,970 --> 02:33:37,670
I need to know.

3766
02:33:39,710 --> 02:33:41,710
This is very important.

3767
02:33:42,410 --> 02:33:42,610
F?

3768
02:33:43,010 --> 02:33:43,950
Okay, nice.

3769
02:33:46,330 --> 02:33:47,550
Jump with joy!

3770
02:33:52,830 --> 02:33:53,630
Prayer.

3771
02:33:57,850 --> 02:33:59,490
The best part.

3772
02:33:59,710 --> 02:34:00,230
There you go.

3773
02:34:04,750 --> 02:34:08,070
Greetings, great champion called by grace.

3774
02:34:08,810 --> 02:34:09,710
I am Fia.

3775
02:34:10,770 --> 02:34:14,290
Circumstances have compelled my stay at the round table hold.

3776
02:34:15,050 --> 02:34:15,950
Great champion.

3777
02:34:16,290 --> 02:34:17,850
No, I'm praying for it.

3778
02:34:17,990 --> 02:34:19,970
I'm praying for it to work.

3779
02:34:20,310 --> 02:34:20,530
Briefly.

3780
02:34:20,870 --> 02:34:24,890
Perhaps you might share with me some of your lifely vigor.

3781
02:34:24,890 --> 02:34:27,330
And your stout-heartedness.

3782
02:34:27,330 --> 02:34:27,410
And your stout-heartedness.

3783
02:34:27,570 --> 02:34:29,850
Doing so will grant me the warmth.

3784
02:34:29,990 --> 02:34:33,050
Oh my god, is this where I'm gonna get a maiden?

3785
02:34:33,770 --> 02:34:35,830
We'll bear a buldekin's blessing.

3786
02:34:36,230 --> 02:34:37,510
Wife number four.

3787
02:34:38,390 --> 02:34:41,570
Where I come from, it is a sacred act.

3788
02:34:43,490 --> 02:34:44,350
Oh my god.

3789
02:34:44,510 --> 02:34:45,090
Yes, hold me.

3790
02:34:49,670 --> 02:34:51,110
Oh my god.

3791
02:34:51,630 --> 02:34:54,030
We're going to second base.

3792
02:34:54,590 --> 02:34:54,850
Guys.

3793
02:34:55,330 --> 02:34:55,730
I knew it.

3794
02:34:55,810 --> 02:34:55,990
See?

3795
02:34:56,230 --> 02:34:57,470
The prayer worked.

3796
02:34:58,130 --> 02:34:59,830
The prayer worked.

3797
02:35:00,130 --> 02:35:00,430
Guys.

3798
02:35:02,490 --> 02:35:03,370
You're...

3799
02:35:03,370 --> 02:35:04,530
Very warm.

3800
02:35:05,770 --> 02:35:06,350
Oh!

3801
02:35:07,090 --> 02:35:10,820
Felt light up inside you.

3802
02:35:11,480 --> 02:35:12,260
Was a buldekin's blessing.

3803
02:35:12,260 --> 02:35:12,660
My HP!

3804
02:35:13,420 --> 02:35:16,040
Though it is but a fleeting thing, I am afraid.

3805
02:35:16,700 --> 02:35:17,520
Come back to me.

3806
02:35:17,860 --> 02:35:19,280
Should you require another?

3807
02:35:19,760 --> 02:35:20,100
Wait.

3808
02:35:20,400 --> 02:35:21,620
I will take you in my arms.

3809
02:35:21,800 --> 02:35:22,440
My HP!

3810
02:35:28,230 --> 02:35:29,670
How much did she take?

3811
02:35:31,350 --> 02:35:32,510
How much?

3812
02:35:33,290 --> 02:35:34,910
Fuck god, I got cooties.

3813
02:35:35,310 --> 02:35:35,590
God.

3814
02:35:35,590 --> 02:35:35,910
Oh my god.

3815
02:35:40,390 --> 02:35:40,950
Wait.

3816
02:35:41,350 --> 02:35:42,570
My kakuris.

3817
02:35:43,350 --> 02:35:44,130
Oh my god.

3818
02:35:46,330 --> 02:35:48,510
I can use an item to get rid of it.

3819
02:35:50,450 --> 02:35:51,010
Wait.

3820
02:35:51,150 --> 02:35:52,210
Let me put another message.

3821
02:36:05,450 --> 02:36:06,010
Uh.

3822
02:36:08,630 --> 02:36:10,310
Is there...

3823
02:36:10,310 --> 02:36:11,930
Is there...

3824
02:36:11,930 --> 02:36:11,950
Is there...

3825
02:36:11,950 --> 02:36:12,190
Ah.

3826
02:36:12,410 --> 02:36:12,950
Woman.

3827
02:36:18,890 --> 02:36:19,450
Sinner.

3828
02:36:29,010 --> 02:36:30,550
This is a story.

3829
02:36:32,230 --> 02:36:33,150
This is a story.

3830
02:36:33,150 --> 02:36:33,690
Three parts.

3831
02:36:34,110 --> 02:36:36,310
This is a story right here.

3832
02:36:38,750 --> 02:36:40,490
I committed sin.

3833
02:36:40,790 --> 02:36:41,570
I knew it.

3834
02:36:41,770 --> 02:36:44,610
My body is for God and God only.

3835
02:36:47,730 --> 02:36:49,630
I knew it.

3836
02:36:49,790 --> 02:36:53,070
I betrayed Jesus and my Lord.

3837
02:36:53,850 --> 02:36:54,730
I knew it.

3838
02:36:57,290 --> 02:37:00,510
This body is for God only.

3839
02:37:02,350 --> 02:37:03,770
Mirror, mirror.

3840
02:37:04,590 --> 02:37:04,970
Wait.

3841
02:37:05,310 --> 02:37:06,550
How do I get rid of it?

3842
02:37:06,550 --> 02:37:08,030
What does she even do to me?

3843
02:37:08,210 --> 02:37:09,710
What do I get out of that?

3844
02:37:10,670 --> 02:37:12,350
Did I get anything out of it?

3845
02:37:12,510 --> 02:37:13,230
What is this?

3846
02:37:15,310 --> 02:37:18,530
Use FP to temporary boost poise.

3847
02:37:18,750 --> 02:37:19,390
Is that it?

3848
02:37:21,550 --> 02:37:22,910
Oh, but it's only temporary.

3849
02:37:25,090 --> 02:37:28,050
Yeah, she gave you cooties.

3850
02:37:28,550 --> 02:37:29,410
Yeah, I know that.

3851
02:37:29,870 --> 02:37:32,010
But like, did she give me anything else?

3852
02:37:33,470 --> 02:37:34,450
Try door.

3853
02:37:36,290 --> 02:37:37,350
Fucking liar.

3854
02:37:39,010 --> 02:37:40,130
Bad message.

3855
02:37:44,870 --> 02:37:47,270
Oh, it turns the debuff off.

3856
02:37:47,450 --> 02:37:47,710
Okay.

3857
02:37:48,530 --> 02:37:49,490
I'll use it now.

3858
02:37:49,590 --> 02:37:50,250
Should I use it now?

3859
02:38:00,920 --> 02:38:02,080
Yeah, okay.

3860
02:38:09,580 --> 02:38:11,320
Did it just take my magic?

3861
02:38:12,380 --> 02:38:13,440
Lover ahead.

3862
02:38:14,600 --> 02:38:15,560
Which way?

3863
02:38:21,450 --> 02:38:22,430
Too high up.

3864
02:38:24,310 --> 02:38:24,530
What?

3865
02:38:26,530 --> 02:38:27,530
My God.

3866
02:38:27,710 --> 02:38:28,950
There's a lover right here?

3867
02:38:31,490 --> 02:38:32,210
No!

3868
02:38:33,130 --> 02:38:34,410
Where is she?

3869
02:38:35,350 --> 02:38:37,150
I learned nothing.

3870
02:38:38,590 --> 02:38:39,850
No, I learned.

3871
02:38:40,050 --> 02:38:41,730
I learned I committed sin.

3872
02:38:43,230 --> 02:38:44,170
Oh, I'm not.

3873
02:38:44,290 --> 02:38:45,790
I have to complete a quest.

3874
02:38:46,190 --> 02:38:47,150
Oh, I see.

3875
02:38:48,290 --> 02:38:48,830
Okay.

3876
02:38:50,430 --> 02:38:52,390
Alright, I think I explored everywhere here.

3877
02:38:53,410 --> 02:38:55,070
I guess I just go this way now.

3878
02:38:57,590 --> 02:38:58,130
The door.

3879
02:38:58,250 --> 02:38:58,850
Oh, never mind.

3880
02:38:58,990 --> 02:39:00,410
I guess I don't go this way.

3881
02:39:02,970 --> 02:39:04,230
I don't do that.

3882
02:39:04,370 --> 02:39:06,090
How the fuck do I get out of here?

3883
02:39:09,840 --> 02:39:11,060
How do I get out of here?

3884
02:39:11,360 --> 02:39:12,800
I feel like I'm stuck here.

3885
02:39:15,820 --> 02:39:16,220
Map?

3886
02:39:16,420 --> 02:39:17,440
Oh, I just have to leave.

3887
02:39:18,720 --> 02:39:19,480
Oh, okay.

3888
02:39:20,540 --> 02:39:21,440
Where was I?

3889
02:39:21,620 --> 02:39:21,860
Here?

3890
02:39:22,340 --> 02:39:23,480
That's where I killed Margaret.

3891
02:39:25,820 --> 02:39:27,900
I teleport from the map.

3892
02:39:28,600 --> 02:39:28,960
Absolute.

3893
02:39:29,040 --> 02:39:29,680
Thank you, the super chat.

3894
02:39:29,800 --> 02:39:30,000
Thank you.

3895
02:39:30,120 --> 02:39:30,380
Thank you.

3896
02:39:30,500 --> 02:39:34,040
This is how I feel to the male fantasy.

3897
02:39:35,700 --> 02:39:36,820
Did I do this or...

3898
02:39:36,820 --> 02:39:37,000
Oh, no.

3899
02:39:37,140 --> 02:39:38,360
I already did.

3900
02:39:39,120 --> 02:39:39,600
Okay.

3901
02:39:40,280 --> 02:39:41,360
Wait, can I level up or no?

3902
02:39:41,460 --> 02:39:42,500
No, I don't have a lot.

3903
02:39:46,050 --> 02:39:46,650
Hello.

3904
02:39:47,090 --> 02:39:48,170
I'm here now.

3905
02:39:50,270 --> 02:39:50,870
Hello.

3906
02:39:51,870 --> 02:39:53,090
Hello, everybody.

3907
02:39:54,590 --> 02:39:56,350
Anything here that I can steal?

3908
02:39:57,950 --> 02:39:58,990
Any enemies?

3909
02:40:02,830 --> 02:40:03,430
Hello?

3910
02:40:03,910 --> 02:40:04,710
Any enemies?

3911
02:40:05,930 --> 02:40:06,930
Anyone here?

3912
02:40:07,070 --> 02:40:08,530
That wants to fuck me up?

3913
02:40:10,070 --> 02:40:10,730
Oh.

3914
02:40:11,090 --> 02:40:12,550
I could go down, technically.

3915
02:40:13,610 --> 02:40:15,410
I could go down here.

3916
02:40:15,870 --> 02:40:16,490
Oh, wait.

3917
02:40:16,610 --> 02:40:17,810
There's a resting point.

3918
02:40:18,470 --> 02:40:19,530
Hello, everybody.

3919
02:40:20,070 --> 02:40:21,550
Hello, Dr. Nick.

3920
02:40:22,750 --> 02:40:23,710
I could go this way.

3921
02:40:25,930 --> 02:40:27,210
There's a body.

3922
02:40:27,770 --> 02:40:28,190
Yoink.

3923
02:40:30,030 --> 02:40:31,650
Remini summons signs of players.

3924
02:40:32,070 --> 02:40:39,530
Gold signs indicate red signs indicate the multiplayer session will begin once I type has been you will take the role of host of fingers.

3925
02:40:39,770 --> 02:40:41,470
Oh, this is where I can do multiplayer.

3926
02:40:47,060 --> 02:40:48,540
Okay, but I can also get invaded.

3927
02:40:48,740 --> 02:40:49,900
So, like, let's not do that.

3928
02:40:55,300 --> 02:40:58,380
Let's not do that, guys.

3929
02:40:58,600 --> 02:41:01,760
I think I don't want to get invaded.

3930
02:41:02,380 --> 02:41:02,800
I...

3931
02:41:04,220 --> 02:41:05,600
I go down?

3932
02:41:06,060 --> 02:41:08,160
Or is that too scary?

3933
02:41:13,700 --> 02:41:14,760
How did he die?

3934
02:41:19,310 --> 02:41:20,230
Oh, shit.

3935
02:41:20,250 --> 02:41:21,930
He tried to wolverine his way out.

3936
02:41:22,850 --> 02:41:23,210
Ew!

3937
02:41:23,570 --> 02:41:25,090
Welcome to tomato farm.

3938
02:41:25,230 --> 02:41:25,970
Welcome, welcome.

3939
02:41:29,660 --> 02:41:30,500
You there.

3940
02:41:31,140 --> 02:41:32,660
Come over here, would you?

3941
02:41:39,970 --> 02:41:41,050
Be wary of thief.

3942
02:41:42,270 --> 02:41:43,410
Be wary of thief.

3943
02:41:44,530 --> 02:41:46,350
Dastard ahead, therefore attacking.

3944
02:41:46,350 --> 02:41:49,330
Okay, but, like, he seems like a nice guy.

3945
02:41:57,310 --> 02:41:58,510
I don't know.

3946
02:41:59,030 --> 02:41:59,590
I don't know.

3947
02:41:59,650 --> 02:42:00,710
I think they're lying.

3948
02:42:01,070 --> 02:42:02,390
I think he's a nice...

3949
02:42:02,390 --> 02:42:03,770
He could be a nice guy.

3950
02:42:04,150 --> 02:42:04,970
You don't know that.

3951
02:42:05,570 --> 02:42:06,410
He can't...

3952
02:42:06,410 --> 02:42:08,710
Come over here, won't you?

3953
02:42:08,710 --> 02:42:10,990
No thief ahead.

3954
02:42:13,330 --> 02:42:15,190
He seems trustworthy.

3955
02:42:19,050 --> 02:42:19,510
You're...

3956
02:42:19,510 --> 02:42:21,470
You're tarnished, aren't you?

3957
02:42:21,830 --> 02:42:22,090
Yeah?

3958
02:42:23,130 --> 02:42:27,330
I would advise against taking the main gate into the castle.

3959
02:42:28,510 --> 02:42:32,070
It's tightly guarded by hardened old hands.

3960
02:42:33,590 --> 02:42:35,910
Try the opening right here.

3961
02:42:36,730 --> 02:42:39,030
The guards don't know about it.

3962
02:42:40,270 --> 02:42:42,870
You'll breach the castle undetected.

3963
02:42:42,910 --> 02:42:46,290
Can't believe you caught Doki engaging perimeter hugs and...

3964
02:42:46,290 --> 02:42:47,470
No, I'll use the main gate.

3965
02:42:48,290 --> 02:42:49,610
I trust you.

3966
02:42:49,810 --> 02:42:51,830
But I'm gonna use the main gate.

3967
02:42:53,030 --> 02:42:54,930
I totally trust you, though, bro.

3968
02:42:55,630 --> 02:42:56,590
Bro, don't worry.

3969
02:42:56,930 --> 02:42:57,890
I'm gonna believe it.

3970
02:42:58,510 --> 02:42:59,150
Fair enough.

3971
02:42:59,650 --> 02:43:02,390
You certainly don't have to trust me.

3972
02:43:02,770 --> 02:43:04,190
Wait, I can run all messes?

3973
02:43:04,190 --> 02:43:08,110
If you must go through the gates, I'll signal them to open.

3974
02:43:10,390 --> 02:43:12,110
Wait, that's possible?

3975
02:43:21,590 --> 02:43:24,430
Oh my god, I'm pretty sure I did more than ten.

3976
02:43:30,910 --> 02:43:32,590
Guys, this does not look good.

3977
02:43:33,150 --> 02:43:35,050
Why are there dead bodies around?

3978
02:43:35,270 --> 02:43:36,030
Oh, golden rune.

3979
02:43:36,810 --> 02:43:37,230
Oh.

3980
02:43:38,430 --> 02:43:39,490
Oh, shit!

3981
02:43:39,830 --> 02:43:40,250
Oh!

3982
02:43:49,670 --> 02:43:50,190
Okay.

3983
02:43:51,430 --> 02:43:51,950
Um.

3984
02:43:55,390 --> 02:43:56,370
Don't worry.

3985
02:43:57,450 --> 02:43:58,370
Thanks, guys.

3986
02:44:05,560 --> 02:44:06,060
Okay.

3987
02:44:07,400 --> 02:44:07,900
Okay.

3988
02:44:11,350 --> 02:44:12,630
Oh, shit!

3989
02:44:15,210 --> 02:44:16,550
I can outrun this.

3990
02:44:19,130 --> 02:44:20,750
I can outrun this.

3991
02:44:22,030 --> 02:44:22,970
Oh, fuck!

3992
02:44:23,130 --> 02:44:24,130
What the fuck is that?

3993
02:44:28,350 --> 02:44:29,150
Oh, no!

3994
02:44:29,250 --> 02:44:30,530
He told me I got the lion!

3995
02:44:33,590 --> 02:44:35,070
What do you mean there's a lion?

3996
02:44:35,990 --> 02:44:36,830
Get a fish!

3997
02:44:36,910 --> 02:44:37,450
Get over here!

3998
02:44:39,690 --> 02:44:42,030
Nobody ever tells me about the lion!

3999
02:44:47,180 --> 02:44:49,980
You ran in there so fast.

4000
02:44:50,540 --> 02:44:51,880
Oh, my God!

4001
02:44:54,020 --> 02:44:55,420
Oh, my God!

4002
02:44:55,620 --> 02:44:56,120
The lion!

4003
02:44:57,060 --> 02:44:58,960
The lion, the witch, and the war!

4004
02:45:08,910 --> 02:45:10,070
Jesus Christ!

4005
02:45:14,240 --> 02:45:15,320
Oh, my God!

4006
02:45:15,460 --> 02:45:15,920
It's Aslan!

4007
02:45:18,680 --> 02:45:19,620
Mill Street!

4008
02:45:23,970 --> 02:45:24,530
Okay.

4009
02:45:25,870 --> 02:45:28,070
Who gave this lion a knife?

4010
02:45:28,630 --> 02:45:30,650
It's like giving him a fucking gun!

4011
02:45:37,930 --> 02:45:38,470
Oh, my God.

4012
02:45:38,650 --> 02:45:39,710
Oh, my God!

4013
02:45:44,920 --> 02:45:45,960
Jesus Christ.

4014
02:45:47,820 --> 02:45:51,020
Bro, my jellyfish bro is gonna fucking kill him before I can do anything.

4015
02:45:55,880 --> 02:45:56,620
You know what?

4016
02:45:56,720 --> 02:45:57,720
You can... Oh, my God.

4017
02:45:58,620 --> 02:45:59,720
Just die from poison.

4018
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:01,000
Just die from poison.

4019
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:01,720
Yeah!

4020
02:46:06,620 --> 02:46:07,420
Yeah!

4021
02:46:07,540 --> 02:46:07,540
Yeah!

4022
02:46:07,840 --> 02:46:08,540
Let's high five!

4023
02:46:09,860 --> 02:46:11,360
High five!

4024
02:46:13,740 --> 02:46:15,340
Jesus Christ.

4025
02:46:16,240 --> 02:46:18,680
Why didn't no one tell me about the lion?

4026
02:46:18,760 --> 02:46:19,560
Lion!

4027
02:46:20,380 --> 02:46:20,920
What?

4028
02:46:22,260 --> 02:46:23,840
I did it.

4029
02:46:24,400 --> 02:46:27,440
No one ever talks about the fucking lion!

4030
02:46:29,600 --> 02:46:32,260
There has to be, like, a place.

4031
02:46:32,740 --> 02:46:37,040
I didn't think you would go for it.

4032
02:46:40,440 --> 02:46:42,760
Wait, can I go here?

4033
02:46:44,980 --> 02:46:46,120
I'm scared.

4034
02:46:47,420 --> 02:46:49,460
I'm lying on the right.

4035
02:46:50,900 --> 02:46:52,260
Can I go here?

4036
02:46:53,160 --> 02:46:54,720
Oh, hello, jellyfish.

4037
02:46:57,800 --> 02:47:00,100
Oh, there's a heal, thank god.

4038
02:47:00,340 --> 02:47:01,620
Thank fucking god.

4039
02:47:02,980 --> 02:47:04,000
Thank god.

4040
02:47:05,200 --> 02:47:05,760
Yay!

4041
02:47:09,760 --> 02:47:11,760
Alright, I must have enough.

4042
02:47:11,940 --> 02:47:13,040
I do not have enough.

4043
02:47:13,340 --> 02:47:13,720
Never mind.

4044
02:47:16,580 --> 02:47:18,700
Alright, I guess we go up.

4045
02:47:22,890 --> 02:47:25,210
There's no way the lion respawns.

4046
02:47:26,250 --> 02:47:27,530
There's no fucking way.

4047
02:47:27,610 --> 02:47:28,530
I went through so much.

4048
02:47:32,050 --> 02:47:33,450
There's no way.

4049
02:47:33,950 --> 02:47:36,010
There's no way he's back.

4050
02:47:37,690 --> 02:47:39,070
Thank god, he's gone.

4051
02:47:39,430 --> 02:47:41,450
Oh, thank god, he's gone forever.

4052
02:47:41,730 --> 02:47:43,290
Oh, thank god.

4053
02:47:44,090 --> 02:47:44,690
Okay.

4054
02:47:46,330 --> 02:47:47,690
Wait, wrong path?

4055
02:47:50,330 --> 02:47:52,530
Oh, I missed an item next to the grace.

4056
02:47:52,770 --> 02:47:53,590
Where is it?

4057
02:47:57,270 --> 02:47:58,190
Where is the item?

4058
02:47:58,410 --> 02:47:59,390
I don't see no item.

4059
02:48:05,250 --> 02:48:06,770
Watch out for the lion.

4060
02:48:11,450 --> 02:48:13,170
Alright, I guess I'll grab this.

4061
02:48:15,090 --> 02:48:15,610
Oh!

4062
02:48:16,190 --> 02:48:17,010
That's a talisman.

4063
02:48:20,170 --> 02:48:22,390
Wait, is that the tree sentinel?

4064
02:48:33,900 --> 02:48:35,160
Oh, equip it?

4065
02:48:35,340 --> 02:48:35,480
Okay.

4066
02:48:36,860 --> 02:48:38,100
What is that, anyway?

4067
02:48:39,760 --> 02:48:40,880
What was it?

4068
02:48:40,980 --> 02:48:41,760
That I found?

4069
02:48:46,090 --> 02:48:47,950
What the fuck did I- Oh, it's this.

4070
02:48:49,290 --> 02:48:50,250
Boost lightning.

4071
02:48:51,150 --> 02:48:52,290
Wait, I can't equip- wait.

4072
02:48:52,870 --> 02:48:53,810
I couldn't- what is it for?

4073
02:48:53,930 --> 02:48:54,310
Is it equipment?

4074
02:48:55,910 --> 02:48:57,190
Oh, there it is.

4075
02:49:02,500 --> 02:49:03,460
Wanna go outside?

4076
02:49:03,800 --> 02:49:05,060
Wait, I didn't wanna go outside.

4077
02:49:11,130 --> 02:49:12,010
We're leaving.

4078
02:49:13,910 --> 02:49:14,310
Alright.

4079
02:49:14,810 --> 02:49:15,110
Sorry.

4080
02:49:15,770 --> 02:49:17,190
Dad wanted to go outside.

4081
02:49:20,230 --> 02:49:22,330
Bro, I'm not even fighting him yet!

4082
02:49:24,250 --> 02:49:25,110
Storm hill.

4083
02:49:25,510 --> 02:49:27,030
Is this part of the story, though?

4084
02:49:29,550 --> 02:49:30,570
How did he die?

4085
02:49:36,910 --> 02:49:38,270
Nah, nah, blood stings.

4086
02:49:39,270 --> 02:49:39,790
So...

4087
02:49:40,290 --> 02:49:41,190
Oh, it's for later?

4088
02:49:41,470 --> 02:49:41,710
Okay.

4089
02:49:42,110 --> 02:49:43,150
I'll go up the hill.

4090
02:49:48,690 --> 02:49:50,170
I'll go up the hill, then.

4091
02:49:52,410 --> 02:49:52,930
Woah!

4092
02:49:58,840 --> 02:49:59,640
Let's go!

4093
02:49:59,640 --> 02:49:59,720
Woah!

4094
02:50:02,420 --> 02:50:04,100
I'm glad, like, sprinting...

4095
02:50:04,640 --> 02:50:08,120
Sprinting doesn't, like, take up my stamina, which is nice.

4096
02:50:08,720 --> 02:50:09,680
I like that.

4097
02:50:09,780 --> 02:50:10,500
Oh, hey, nice.

4098
02:50:10,960 --> 02:50:11,480
Got Lily.

4099
02:50:13,640 --> 02:50:14,240
I...

4100
02:50:14,240 --> 02:50:16,060
I try to reload my sword.

4101
02:50:20,040 --> 02:50:23,160
I don't know why I keep doing that!

4102
02:50:25,640 --> 02:50:28,680
I keep wanting to reload my sword!

4103
02:50:29,960 --> 02:50:31,040
Oh, shit!

4104
02:50:31,520 --> 02:50:32,700
Oh, fuck!

4105
02:50:32,860 --> 02:50:33,420
I didn't know!

4106
02:50:36,150 --> 02:50:37,310
Oh, my God.

4107
02:50:37,310 --> 02:50:38,870
He has a big-ass axe.

4108
02:50:39,510 --> 02:50:41,070
He has...

4109
02:50:41,070 --> 02:50:42,630
Okay, I'm gonna...

4110
02:50:42,630 --> 02:50:44,350
I'm gonna run.

4111
02:50:45,730 --> 02:50:48,030
Too much Marvel ride.

4112
02:50:48,570 --> 02:50:49,610
I'm gonna restart.

4113
02:50:49,610 --> 02:50:52,090
Don't get to go through so much recently.

4114
02:50:52,290 --> 02:50:52,990
This ain't much, but...

4115
02:50:52,990 --> 02:50:54,850
Aw, thank you, Lise, for the...

4116
02:50:55,550 --> 02:50:55,830
Super!

4117
02:50:56,670 --> 02:50:58,390
I really appreciate it!

4118
02:50:58,510 --> 02:50:59,530
Thank you so much!

4119
02:51:00,450 --> 02:51:01,630
Alright, let's...

4120
02:51:01,630 --> 02:51:03,590
Let's rest up a little.

4121
02:51:08,850 --> 02:51:09,410
Uh...

4122
02:51:09,410 --> 02:51:11,030
I don't have to ask any...

4123
02:51:11,030 --> 02:51:11,490
Okay.

4124
02:51:11,910 --> 02:51:12,490
Here we go.

4125
02:51:14,090 --> 02:51:14,650
Alright.

4126
02:51:16,430 --> 02:51:17,970
We got this.

4127
02:51:19,610 --> 02:51:21,730
Okay, now that I know...

4128
02:51:21,730 --> 02:51:24,010
To not engage that...

4129
02:51:24,010 --> 02:51:24,670
It's fine.

4130
02:51:26,250 --> 02:51:28,590
I'm gonna summon the jellyfish.

4131
02:51:29,630 --> 02:51:30,570
My pal.

4132
02:51:31,810 --> 02:51:33,070
Do your thing.

4133
02:51:34,730 --> 02:51:35,770
That's right!

4134
02:51:36,070 --> 02:51:37,550
Do your thing, my guy!

4135
02:51:38,690 --> 02:51:40,030
I believe!

4136
02:51:42,690 --> 02:51:44,070
Shoot your goo!

4137
02:51:45,950 --> 02:51:47,050
Shoot it!

4138
02:51:47,770 --> 02:51:49,190
Okay, you're missing.

4139
02:51:49,830 --> 02:51:50,950
I can see...

4140
02:51:51,190 --> 02:51:52,910
Where are you shooting?

4141
02:51:54,250 --> 02:51:55,830
Where is he shooting?

4142
02:51:56,570 --> 02:51:57,990
Oh, my...

4143
02:51:57,990 --> 02:52:00,290
Okay, my jellyfish is a little special.

4144
02:52:02,270 --> 02:52:04,450
I don't know where he's shooting, guys.

4145
02:52:05,630 --> 02:52:06,150
I...

4146
02:52:06,150 --> 02:52:06,990
Don't know.

4147
02:52:07,610 --> 02:52:08,430
Jellyfish, please!

4148
02:52:09,110 --> 02:52:10,390
Please, jellyfish!

4149
02:52:13,750 --> 02:52:14,590
Oh, my God.

4150
02:52:15,010 --> 02:52:16,770
I don't know where he's trying to shoot.

4151
02:52:17,010 --> 02:52:19,030
I don't know where he's trying to do.

4152
02:52:21,970 --> 02:52:22,810
Okay, nice.

4153
02:52:25,570 --> 02:52:26,090
Nice.

4154
02:52:26,390 --> 02:52:27,050
He doesn't know.

4155
02:52:27,190 --> 02:52:28,070
Oh, my God.

4156
02:52:28,290 --> 02:52:29,450
Oh, my God!

4157
02:52:30,170 --> 02:52:31,490
I don't know either.

4158
02:52:34,290 --> 02:52:35,310
Oh, my God!

4159
02:52:35,450 --> 02:52:36,490
Oh, my God!

4160
02:52:36,630 --> 02:52:37,550
Oh, my God!

4161
02:52:37,550 --> 02:52:37,630
Oh, shit!

4162
02:52:38,010 --> 02:52:38,390
Jump!

4163
02:52:38,990 --> 02:52:39,490
Jump!

4164
02:52:41,730 --> 02:52:42,470
Here we go.

4165
02:52:43,670 --> 02:52:44,110
We're fine.

4166
02:52:46,350 --> 02:52:47,530
Where is my jelly...

4167
02:52:47,530 --> 02:52:48,310
Where did he...

4168
02:52:48,310 --> 02:52:49,730
Did he die?!

4169
02:52:51,090 --> 02:52:51,810
Oh, my God!

4170
02:52:51,970 --> 02:52:53,750
When did he die?!

4171
02:52:57,810 --> 02:52:59,610
When did my jelly...

4172
02:53:01,840 --> 02:53:02,800
Okay.

4173
02:53:03,260 --> 02:53:05,160
I don't even know when he died!

4174
02:53:05,580 --> 02:53:06,860
He just disappeared!

4175
02:53:10,140 --> 02:53:12,160
Jesus Christ, I hate the archers.

4176
02:53:16,550 --> 02:53:18,370
I don't know what happened to him!

4177
02:53:19,710 --> 02:53:21,050
He just disappeared!

4178
02:53:26,830 --> 02:53:27,510
Jesus!

4179
02:53:29,470 --> 02:53:30,090
Oh, my God.

4180
02:53:30,270 --> 02:53:30,950
I have two flasks left.

4181
02:53:31,130 --> 02:53:31,230
Okay.

4182
02:53:31,310 --> 02:53:32,230
These are a lot of people.

4183
02:53:33,290 --> 02:53:34,310
I might have messed up.

4184
02:53:35,350 --> 02:53:36,630
There was a lot of enemies.

4185
02:53:41,280 --> 02:53:41,640
Okay.

4186
02:53:43,240 --> 02:53:43,980
Get out of here.

4187
02:53:45,420 --> 02:53:48,140
Jesus Christ, he just kicks me and I just let him do that?

4188
02:53:49,240 --> 02:53:49,600
Alright.

4189
02:53:49,780 --> 02:53:51,540
That was a lot of enemies.

4190
02:53:52,540 --> 02:53:52,840
Um...

4191
02:53:53,140 --> 02:53:54,840
I was not ready for that.

4192
02:53:56,020 --> 02:53:57,640
They were pretty tanky.

4193
02:53:58,480 --> 02:54:00,680
There's a dog too?!

4194
02:54:01,580 --> 02:54:03,460
Seek left then up.

4195
02:54:05,140 --> 02:54:05,740
What?

4196
02:54:10,610 --> 02:54:12,230
Is there anything to loot?

4197
02:54:12,530 --> 02:54:13,990
I thought there was nothing...

4198
02:54:13,990 --> 02:54:14,650
I thought I killed it.

4199
02:54:15,330 --> 02:54:15,950
Oh, there is.

4200
02:54:16,070 --> 02:54:16,830
I didn't even see that.

4201
02:54:18,730 --> 02:54:20,330
I don't know why I didn't see that.

4202
02:54:21,330 --> 02:54:22,050
Okay, axe.

4203
02:54:25,500 --> 02:54:26,740
Okay, nice.

4204
02:54:28,780 --> 02:54:30,560
Oh, it means to look up.

4205
02:54:31,920 --> 02:54:33,180
Oh, there's an axe.

4206
02:54:37,520 --> 02:54:39,420
Seek left then up.

4207
02:54:40,060 --> 02:54:40,220
Oh!

4208
02:54:40,920 --> 02:54:41,940
There he is!

4209
02:54:42,380 --> 02:54:43,280
I see him.

4210
02:54:44,240 --> 02:54:44,720
Parkloi.

4211
02:54:45,340 --> 02:54:46,180
Parkloi.

4212
02:54:48,420 --> 02:54:48,840
Parkloi.

4213
02:54:50,420 --> 02:54:51,260
Parkloi.

4214
02:54:52,280 --> 02:54:53,120
Parkloi.

4215
02:54:54,200 --> 02:54:54,620
Parkloi.

4216
02:54:55,220 --> 02:54:56,060
Parkloi.

4217
02:54:58,660 --> 02:54:59,180
Park...

4218
02:55:06,770 --> 02:55:07,290
Park...

4219
02:55:08,230 --> 02:55:08,950
It's fine.

4220
02:55:09,710 --> 02:55:10,230
Parkour.

4221
02:55:11,030 --> 02:55:11,550
Parkour.

4222
02:55:13,230 --> 02:55:13,750
Parkour.

4223
02:55:14,110 --> 02:55:14,430
Parkour.

4224
02:55:15,030 --> 02:55:15,730
It's fine.

4225
02:55:15,850 --> 02:55:16,210
We're fine.

4226
02:55:17,490 --> 02:55:19,210
Oh my god, we might not be fine.

4227
02:55:20,430 --> 02:55:21,630
We might not be fine.

4228
02:55:23,410 --> 02:55:23,930
Okay.

4229
02:55:28,290 --> 02:55:29,830
I swear to god!

4230
02:55:30,090 --> 02:55:31,070
You're such a fucker.

4231
02:55:31,070 --> 02:55:31,090
Okay.

4232
02:55:32,990 --> 02:55:35,390
I would use my one...

4233
02:55:35,390 --> 02:55:36,870
My three arrows just for this.

4234
02:55:39,630 --> 02:55:40,710
Okay, nice.

4235
02:55:43,090 --> 02:55:44,310
Time for...

4236
02:55:44,310 --> 02:55:44,630
Whoa!

4237
02:55:45,790 --> 02:55:46,310
Whoa!

4238
02:55:52,890 --> 02:55:54,390
I was reading!

4239
02:55:54,390 --> 02:55:55,390
I...

4240
02:55:58,070 --> 02:55:59,070
I...

4241
02:55:59,070 --> 02:55:59,750
I...

4242
02:55:59,750 --> 02:56:00,570
What the...

4243
02:56:01,170 --> 02:56:01,670
I...

4244
02:56:01,670 --> 02:56:02,030
Bro!

4245
02:56:05,680 --> 02:56:06,540
Oh, shit.

4246
02:56:07,880 --> 02:56:09,360
Reading is...

4247
02:56:09,360 --> 02:56:11,400
Reading is dangerous, guys.

4248
02:56:11,980 --> 02:56:13,120
Reading is...

4249
02:56:13,120 --> 02:56:14,140
I just...

4250
02:56:14,560 --> 02:56:15,760
Oh my god.

4251
02:56:16,300 --> 02:56:19,120
Who would have thought reading was so dangerous?

4252
02:56:23,280 --> 02:56:25,040
Oh my god!

4253
02:56:28,510 --> 02:56:30,150
He hit me!

4254
02:56:39,450 --> 02:56:40,720
Are you serious?!

4255
02:56:43,550 --> 02:56:45,550
Oh my god, you were right here!

4256
02:56:47,330 --> 02:56:49,210
You were right here!

4257
02:56:53,490 --> 02:56:54,190
Jesus.

4258
02:56:54,530 --> 02:56:54,750
Okay.

4259
02:56:55,170 --> 02:56:56,830
Okay, I know where he is now.

4260
02:56:59,810 --> 02:57:02,630
I swear, oh my god, I swear to fucking God.

4261
02:57:03,450 --> 02:57:04,030
There we go.

4262
02:57:05,430 --> 02:57:09,830
I s- Are you serious?

4263
02:57:10,950 --> 02:57:11,790
There we go.

4264
02:57:13,450 --> 02:57:14,210
We're fine.

4265
02:57:15,510 --> 02:57:16,810
Okay, we're okay now.

4266
02:57:19,810 --> 02:57:22,870
Might be a little fucked because I don't have a lot of arrows left now.

4267
02:57:28,970 --> 02:57:29,410
Okay.

4268
02:57:31,170 --> 02:57:33,470
All right, now I have to deal with these guys.

4269
02:57:33,690 --> 02:57:34,010
These two.

4270
02:57:34,750 --> 02:57:36,330
I don't have my jellyfish.

4271
02:57:40,450 --> 02:57:41,530
Don't go up.

4272
02:57:41,710 --> 02:57:42,710
Where do I go?

4273
02:57:52,520 --> 02:57:54,120
How do I get out of here?

4274
02:57:54,900 --> 02:57:56,260
Just run past them?

4275
02:58:01,360 --> 02:58:01,800
Oh.

4276
02:58:02,280 --> 02:58:02,840
Okay, I got it.

4277
02:58:02,960 --> 02:58:03,560
I know what to do.

4278
02:58:07,010 --> 02:58:08,050
I don't know what to do.

4279
02:58:08,670 --> 02:58:09,550
Never mind.

4280
02:58:14,730 --> 02:58:16,270
Okay, watch this, guys.

4281
02:58:32,130 --> 02:58:33,090
I'm gonna do not go up.

4282
02:58:33,110 --> 02:58:34,530
I do not go up.

4283
02:58:34,810 --> 02:58:35,250
There we go.

4284
02:58:35,250 --> 02:58:35,270
Hang on.

4285
02:58:35,270 --> 02:58:35,950
Oh, my god!

4286
02:58:36,230 --> 02:58:37,350
Oh my god!

4287
02:58:37,650 --> 02:58:37,670
Oh my god!

4288
02:58:37,670 --> 02:58:37,730
Oh my god!

4289
02:58:37,730 --> 02:58:38,410
Where do I go?

4290
02:58:38,410 --> 02:58:38,590
Oh!

4291
02:58:40,110 --> 02:58:41,570
Oh my god!

4292
02:58:41,890 --> 02:58:42,590
Room!

4293
02:58:43,490 --> 02:58:44,730
Safe room!

4294
02:58:45,950 --> 02:58:48,790
Guys, that room wasn't a safe room.

4295
02:58:48,970 --> 02:58:49,650
Oh!

4296
02:58:50,910 --> 02:58:52,270
Oh my god!

4297
02:58:52,910 --> 02:58:53,110
Oh!

4298
02:58:56,910 --> 02:58:58,530
Who would've thought?

4299
02:58:58,690 --> 02:58:59,550
Oh shit!

4300
02:58:59,950 --> 02:59:00,670
Oh shit!

4301
02:59:01,010 --> 02:59:01,670
They're everywhere!

4302
02:59:02,210 --> 02:59:02,910
They're everywhere!

4303
02:59:03,410 --> 02:59:03,890
Oh!

4304
02:59:04,090 --> 02:59:05,510
When do I stop running?

4305
02:59:08,640 --> 02:59:10,460
When can I stop?

4306
02:59:10,460 --> 02:59:10,720
Oh!

4307
02:59:11,280 --> 02:59:12,000
Wait!

4308
02:59:12,680 --> 02:59:13,300
Oh!

4309
02:59:14,440 --> 02:59:15,460
Wrong way!

4310
02:59:15,680 --> 02:59:16,480
Wrong way!

4311
02:59:16,740 --> 02:59:17,540
Wrong way!

4312
02:59:19,980 --> 02:59:22,380
I have had to go the wrong way!

4313
02:59:22,680 --> 02:59:23,800
Oh shit!

4314
02:59:24,020 --> 02:59:24,160
Okay!

4315
02:59:24,420 --> 02:59:24,860
This way!

4316
02:59:25,320 --> 02:59:25,920
This way!

4317
02:59:26,260 --> 02:59:27,480
Oh my god!

4318
02:59:27,720 --> 02:59:29,000
Oh my god!

4319
02:59:31,420 --> 02:59:32,400
Oh my god!

4320
02:59:32,400 --> 02:59:32,480
Oh my god!

4321
02:59:32,600 --> 02:59:33,900
There's so many areas!

4322
02:59:34,160 --> 02:59:34,620
Oh!

4323
02:59:34,700 --> 02:59:37,020
There's a giant fucking guy!

4324
02:59:37,620 --> 02:59:38,280
Oh!

4325
02:59:38,920 --> 02:59:39,360
Oh!

4326
02:59:39,360 --> 02:59:39,360
No!

4327
02:59:40,820 --> 02:59:41,380
Please!

4328
02:59:41,600 --> 02:59:42,060
Please!

4329
02:59:42,700 --> 02:59:42,700
Please!

4330
02:59:43,740 --> 02:59:44,140
No!

4331
02:59:44,480 --> 02:59:44,480
Wait!

4332
02:59:44,860 --> 02:59:45,060
No!

4333
02:59:45,860 --> 02:59:46,560
It's okay!

4334
02:59:47,040 --> 02:59:47,360
It's okay!

4335
02:59:47,640 --> 02:59:48,560
Don't keep still!

4336
02:59:48,760 --> 02:59:49,300
Wrong way!

4337
02:59:49,800 --> 02:59:50,360
Oh!

4338
02:59:50,520 --> 02:59:50,720
Fuck!

4339
02:59:50,820 --> 02:59:50,940
Okay!

4340
02:59:51,100 --> 02:59:51,480
Right way!

4341
02:59:54,000 --> 02:59:55,000
Here we go!

4342
02:59:55,640 --> 02:59:56,040
Here we go!

4343
02:59:56,040 --> 02:59:56,300
Here we go!

4344
02:59:56,380 --> 02:59:56,500
We got it!

4345
02:59:56,980 --> 02:59:57,320
We're safe!

4346
02:59:57,740 --> 02:59:58,380
We're safe!

4347
02:59:59,100 --> 03:00:01,800
She actually made it!

4348
03:00:01,960 --> 03:00:04,640
I was like how do I still go the wrong way!

4349
03:00:04,640 --> 03:00:05,660
I have to let go!

4350
03:00:05,660 --> 03:00:07,260
I didn't have to let go!

4351
03:00:08,180 --> 03:00:08,180
Oh!

4352
03:00:10,480 --> 03:00:11,020
Nice!

4353
03:00:11,480 --> 03:00:14,360
Thank you for sending support message even though I forgot to submit mine!

4354
03:00:14,600 --> 03:00:16,140
Thank you for your streams and bringing smiles!

4355
03:00:16,440 --> 03:00:16,840
I'm amazing!

4356
03:00:17,080 --> 03:00:18,620
Thank you for the super chat!

4357
03:00:19,060 --> 03:00:19,540
Thank you!

4358
03:00:19,780 --> 03:00:20,560
Thank you!

4359
03:00:20,960 --> 03:00:22,440
Holy fuck!

4360
03:00:23,100 --> 03:00:24,380
Ester thank you for the super chat!

4361
03:00:24,560 --> 03:00:24,920
Thank you!

4362
03:00:25,100 --> 03:00:25,660
Thank you!

4363
03:00:25,980 --> 03:00:27,920
What do we upgrade?

4364
03:00:28,500 --> 03:00:30,480
I survived guys!

4365
03:00:30,860 --> 03:00:31,580
I did it!

4366
03:00:31,880 --> 03:00:33,540
With sheer determination!

4367
03:00:33,540 --> 03:00:35,420
I survived.

4368
03:00:38,520 --> 03:00:41,560
I don't know how I survived that.

4369
03:00:42,080 --> 03:00:43,160
I don't know.

4370
03:00:48,440 --> 03:00:49,680
It was legs!

4371
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:54,500
Guys, remember I... Guys, remember I boosted the thighs?

4372
03:00:55,240 --> 03:00:55,580
Guys!

4373
03:01:00,280 --> 03:01:02,000
Gerald, thank you for the super chat.

4374
03:01:02,160 --> 03:01:03,120
Thank you, thank you.

4375
03:01:03,120 --> 03:01:05,520
Plenty, thank you for the super chat.

4376
03:01:05,700 --> 03:01:06,800
Thank you, thank you.

4377
03:01:07,100 --> 03:01:09,160
How the hell gets the legs?

4378
03:01:09,320 --> 03:01:11,140
I invested in the thighs!

4379
03:01:11,680 --> 03:01:14,440
Chad, I invested in the thighs!

4380
03:01:16,580 --> 03:01:19,800
I knew it would be handy someday.

4381
03:01:23,100 --> 03:01:25,480
Never skip leg day.

4382
03:01:26,280 --> 03:01:26,460
Okay.

4383
03:01:28,140 --> 03:01:30,460
Lick thighs, save lives, exactly.

4384
03:01:33,120 --> 03:01:33,440
Okay.

4385
03:01:33,980 --> 03:01:37,340
Do we... Do we... Do we nexterity or, like, strength?

4386
03:01:38,960 --> 03:01:40,240
Or... Endurance?

4387
03:01:41,160 --> 03:01:41,820
Okay.

4388
03:01:42,140 --> 03:01:43,280
I'll do, like...

4389
03:01:43,280 --> 03:01:46,140
We haven't upgraded strength yet, though.

4390
03:01:46,560 --> 03:01:47,340
That's the thing.

4391
03:01:50,850 --> 03:01:51,390
Okay.

4392
03:01:51,890 --> 03:01:52,530
Nexterity?

4393
03:01:52,670 --> 03:01:52,910
Okay.

4394
03:01:54,710 --> 03:01:55,990
Alright, here we go.

4395
03:01:57,150 --> 03:02:01,270
Okay, was that an entire dungeon I just ran past?

4396
03:02:03,090 --> 03:02:07,150
Jesus Christ, that was a fucking scary dungeon.

4397
03:02:12,170 --> 03:02:13,490
Holy fuck.

4398
03:02:14,810 --> 03:02:15,950
Weak foe behind.

4399
03:02:18,090 --> 03:02:19,130
I survived.

4400
03:02:19,630 --> 03:02:19,770
I survived.

4401
03:02:19,770 --> 03:02:19,790
Okay.

4402
03:02:20,350 --> 03:02:21,750
I could die here, though.

4403
03:02:24,850 --> 03:02:26,650
This could be how I died.

4404
03:02:38,350 --> 03:02:40,690
I don't know how I fucked it up, but I did.

4405
03:02:41,530 --> 03:02:42,110
I...

4406
03:02:42,110 --> 03:02:42,910
Oh my god!

4407
03:02:43,150 --> 03:02:44,410
Oh my...

4408
03:02:48,570 --> 03:02:49,690
Oh my...

4409
03:02:49,690 --> 03:02:50,270
Oh!

4410
03:02:50,270 --> 03:02:50,430
No!

4411
03:02:54,530 --> 03:02:55,150
Okay.

4412
03:02:55,710 --> 03:02:56,910
Okay, there we go.

4413
03:03:00,270 --> 03:03:00,810
Alright.

4414
03:03:02,690 --> 03:03:04,070
There we go, this time.

4415
03:03:08,180 --> 03:03:08,800
Alright.

4416
03:03:10,260 --> 03:03:12,240
I forgot to charge hit it.

4417
03:03:16,020 --> 03:03:17,160
That did nothing.

4418
03:03:17,440 --> 03:03:18,360
That did nothing!

4419
03:03:18,600 --> 03:03:19,520
That did nothing!

4420
03:03:19,720 --> 03:03:21,020
That did nothing!

4421
03:03:22,280 --> 03:03:23,640
Oh my god!

4422
03:03:23,860 --> 03:03:25,040
How did that do it?

4423
03:03:25,180 --> 03:03:25,460
Wait.

4424
03:03:25,660 --> 03:03:26,360
Can he make it through?

4425
03:03:27,340 --> 03:03:28,300
Oh my god!

4426
03:03:28,460 --> 03:03:28,900
Oh my god!

4427
03:03:29,140 --> 03:03:29,760
Oh my god!

4428
03:03:37,420 --> 03:03:39,080
Oh my god!

4429
03:03:39,360 --> 03:03:40,880
That was so scary.

4430
03:03:41,840 --> 03:03:43,960
That was so scary.

4431
03:03:44,680 --> 03:03:45,860
Oh my god!

4432
03:03:46,720 --> 03:03:47,880
Oh my god!

4433
03:03:49,610 --> 03:03:51,590
He was running so fast!

4434
03:03:53,510 --> 03:03:54,030
Oh.

4435
03:03:54,030 --> 03:03:55,210
Yes, he can.

4436
03:03:56,550 --> 03:03:58,750
I think he made it through.

4437
03:04:02,450 --> 03:04:03,930
That was like a bad dream.

4438
03:04:04,190 --> 03:04:06,750
Wait, but can he make it inside this hole?

4439
03:04:06,990 --> 03:04:08,390
Wait, I don't think he can!

4440
03:04:08,650 --> 03:04:09,670
Wait, I got this!

4441
03:04:10,750 --> 03:04:12,010
I figured it out.

4442
03:04:21,730 --> 03:04:22,250
Chop!

4443
03:04:32,870 --> 03:04:33,910
That's right!

4444
03:04:34,370 --> 03:04:37,910
There's no way you can get me from here!

4445
03:04:39,470 --> 03:04:40,430
That's right!

4446
03:04:40,830 --> 03:04:41,390
Fight me!

4447
03:04:43,730 --> 03:04:45,450
Come on, get in here!

4448
03:04:46,230 --> 03:04:47,750
Yeah, that's right!

4449
03:04:47,930 --> 03:04:49,230
You don't fit in the hole.

4450
03:04:49,870 --> 03:04:51,090
You're too big!

4451
03:04:52,290 --> 03:04:53,270
That's right!

4452
03:04:54,350 --> 03:04:55,830
You don't fit in the hole!

4453
03:04:57,130 --> 03:04:58,310
Oh, you mad!

4454
03:04:59,010 --> 03:05:00,070
You're so mad!

4455
03:05:01,010 --> 03:05:01,730
That's right!

4456
03:05:01,910 --> 03:05:02,950
What you gonna do?

4457
03:05:03,510 --> 03:05:06,030
You can't fit in here, you're too big!

4458
03:05:06,430 --> 03:05:07,150
That's right!

4459
03:05:07,770 --> 03:05:08,650
That's fucking right!

4460
03:05:08,690 --> 03:05:09,510
Yeah, I said it!

4461
03:05:10,490 --> 03:05:12,910
I said... Bro's mad!

4462
03:05:13,390 --> 03:05:15,030
Oh my god, but your minions can!

4463
03:05:15,210 --> 03:05:17,010
Your minions can fit in the hole!

4464
03:05:17,010 --> 03:05:18,050
Oh my god!

4465
03:05:18,050 --> 03:05:20,210
Oh my god, your minions can fit in the hole!

4466
03:05:20,450 --> 03:05:21,290
Oh my god!

4467
03:05:21,750 --> 03:05:22,390
Oh my god!

4468
03:05:23,370 --> 03:05:24,170
Put me!

4469
03:05:24,510 --> 03:05:24,770
No!

4470
03:05:38,630 --> 03:05:39,830
I'm sorry!

4471
03:05:40,690 --> 03:05:41,590
Oh my god!

4472
03:05:41,870 --> 03:05:43,850
Oh my god, I didn't think!

4473
03:05:44,230 --> 03:05:45,690
That's my sister!

4474
03:05:45,690 --> 03:05:46,190
Dad!

4475
03:05:46,750 --> 03:05:50,470
Where's my... That's my sister!

4476
03:05:52,130 --> 03:05:55,910
It was the karma always, always...

4477
03:05:55,910 --> 03:05:57,930
They get it back...

4478
03:05:57,930 --> 03:05:59,890
...in the hole...

4479
03:05:59,890 --> 03:06:00,970
...thingy...

4480
03:06:02,650 --> 03:06:05,330
I can't believe it!

4481
03:06:05,970 --> 03:06:06,430
I...

4482
03:06:06,430 --> 03:06:08,410
...get it wrecked!

4483
03:06:08,410 --> 03:06:10,590
Garlin, thank you for the super chat!

4484
03:06:10,770 --> 03:06:11,490
Thank you, thank you!

4485
03:06:11,530 --> 03:06:14,170
I didn't know he was gonna send him!

4486
03:06:14,370 --> 03:06:17,470
I didn't think you was gonna send his...

4487
03:06:17,470 --> 03:06:19,190
...his buddies in here!

4488
03:06:19,430 --> 03:06:21,070
That's so fucked up!

4489
03:06:21,450 --> 03:06:23,930
He sent his friends into the fight!

4490
03:06:23,930 --> 03:06:23,970
Wait!

4491
03:06:26,030 --> 03:06:26,430
Okay!

4492
03:06:27,210 --> 03:06:27,690
Okay!

4493
03:06:27,690 --> 03:06:27,730
Okay!

4494
03:06:27,910 --> 03:06:28,390
I can...

4495
03:06:28,390 --> 03:06:29,290
I can kill him!

4496
03:06:29,610 --> 03:06:30,070
I believe!

4497
03:06:30,870 --> 03:06:32,110
He happened around him!

4498
03:06:32,350 --> 03:06:32,530
Fine!

4499
03:06:33,550 --> 03:06:34,030
Mark!

4500
03:06:34,250 --> 03:06:35,830
Thank you for the super chat!

4501
03:06:36,050 --> 03:06:36,410
Thank you!

4502
03:06:36,550 --> 03:06:37,030
Thank you!

4503
03:06:37,230 --> 03:06:37,570
Okay!

4504
03:06:37,710 --> 03:06:38,270
Now I know!

4505
03:06:38,810 --> 03:06:40,690
His homie said, hold up!

4506
03:06:40,910 --> 03:06:41,930
We got this!

4507
03:06:44,610 --> 03:06:48,400
What the f- Okay!

4508
03:06:48,800 --> 03:06:49,140
Okay!

4509
03:06:49,320 --> 03:06:50,400
His friends are scary!

4510
03:06:50,920 --> 03:06:52,860
His friends are scary!

4511
03:06:53,420 --> 03:06:53,980
Okay!

4512
03:06:54,200 --> 03:06:54,400
Okay!

4513
03:06:54,580 --> 03:06:56,160
I know he can't get into this hole...

4514
03:06:56,720 --> 03:06:57,180
So it's...

4515
03:06:57,180 --> 03:06:57,520
Whoa!

4516
03:07:01,620 --> 03:07:02,180
Okay!

4517
03:07:02,300 --> 03:07:02,640
It's fine!

4518
03:07:02,880 --> 03:07:03,560
I have...

4519
03:07:03,560 --> 03:07:04,940
I have...

4520
03:07:06,160 --> 03:07:09,160
Oh my god!

4521
03:07:09,320 --> 03:07:11,300
My jellyfish summons doesn't work out here!

4522
03:07:11,620 --> 03:07:12,220
My jelly...

4523
03:07:12,220 --> 03:07:12,900
Oh my god!

4524
03:07:13,020 --> 03:07:14,960
My jellyfish summons don't work here!

4525
03:07:14,960 --> 03:07:15,980
My jelly...

4526
03:07:15,980 --> 03:07:16,800
Oh my god!

4527
03:07:17,020 --> 03:07:18,980
My jellyfish summons don't work here!

4528
03:07:23,760 --> 03:07:24,800
Oh no!

4529
03:07:27,640 --> 03:07:28,160
Okay!

4530
03:07:29,140 --> 03:07:29,860
It's okay!

4531
03:07:30,000 --> 03:07:30,440
I believe!

4532
03:07:31,720 --> 03:07:32,660
I believe!

4533
03:07:36,920 --> 03:07:37,620
That's right!

4534
03:07:37,840 --> 03:07:38,140
Oh!

4535
03:07:38,540 --> 03:07:40,040
I did the big mistake!

4536
03:07:40,360 --> 03:07:41,260
Oh my god!

4537
03:07:41,520 --> 03:07:42,280
Oh my god!

4538
03:07:42,360 --> 03:07:43,380
I did not think...

4539
03:07:43,380 --> 03:07:45,540
I did not think he was there for his buddy!

4540
03:07:45,540 --> 03:07:46,980
I didn't think his...

4541
03:07:46,980 --> 03:07:48,380
His buddy was just bait!

4542
03:07:48,980 --> 03:07:49,440
I...

4543
03:07:53,300 --> 03:07:54,380
Oh my god!

4544
03:07:54,740 --> 03:07:57,980
I can't believe he used his buddy as bait there!

4545
03:08:00,880 --> 03:08:01,520
Okay!

4546
03:08:02,460 --> 03:08:03,540
This is fine!

4547
03:08:05,200 --> 03:08:06,340
There's no way!

4548
03:08:08,560 --> 03:08:09,340
No way!

4549
03:08:09,460 --> 03:08:09,640
He'll...

4550
03:08:09,640 --> 03:08:10,660
He'll forget about me!

4551
03:08:10,780 --> 03:08:10,940
Right?

4552
03:08:11,980 --> 03:08:13,420
I killed his friends!

4553
03:08:13,480 --> 03:08:15,080
He's gonna forget about me!

4554
03:08:17,140 --> 03:08:19,320
Ride and die together!

4555
03:08:20,580 --> 03:08:21,540
1v1 time!

4556
03:08:21,900 --> 03:08:22,020
Bro!

4557
03:08:22,160 --> 03:08:22,540
Turn around!

4558
03:08:23,480 --> 03:08:24,520
I'm not here!

4559
03:08:24,720 --> 03:08:25,240
Turn around!

4560
03:08:33,750 --> 03:08:35,630
How do you know?

4561
03:08:36,050 --> 03:08:37,390
I'm behind a wall!

4562
03:08:38,190 --> 03:08:38,350
Okay!

4563
03:08:38,910 --> 03:08:39,370
I'll crouch!

4564
03:08:40,050 --> 03:08:42,110
Now he definitely knows I'm not here!

4565
03:08:44,430 --> 03:08:45,970
There's no way he knows!

4566
03:08:51,360 --> 03:08:52,620
He's just waiting!

4567
03:08:53,640 --> 03:08:54,380
How does he know?

4568
03:08:54,460 --> 03:08:55,520
He keeps coming back!

4569
03:08:59,300 --> 03:09:00,980
How do you know?

4570
03:09:02,040 --> 03:09:04,080
He's just looking at me!

4571
03:09:04,340 --> 03:09:06,060
He's just standing there!

4572
03:09:07,020 --> 03:09:07,760
Menacingly!

4573
03:09:08,120 --> 03:09:09,440
How does he know?

4574
03:09:11,100 --> 03:09:13,620
He can smell the fear!

4575
03:09:16,300 --> 03:09:19,060
Turn around so I can summon my buddy!

4576
03:09:25,260 --> 03:09:26,740
He's fucked up!

4577
03:09:28,200 --> 03:09:30,180
He's watching this stream!

4578
03:09:30,380 --> 03:09:31,660
Oh thank god he's turning around!

4579
03:09:31,940 --> 03:09:32,040
Okay.

4580
03:09:33,220 --> 03:09:33,660
Okay.

4581
03:09:35,080 --> 03:09:36,180
Doesn't know.

4582
03:09:39,790 --> 03:09:40,610
Jellyfish!

4583
03:09:43,260 --> 03:09:44,390
Okay we can do this.

4584
03:09:45,450 --> 03:09:47,710
With the power of jellyfish.

4585
03:09:48,310 --> 03:09:49,670
We can do this.

4586
03:09:50,910 --> 03:09:51,570
Boom!

4587
03:09:51,570 --> 03:09:51,810
Boom!

4588
03:09:52,950 --> 03:09:53,890
That's fucking right!

4589
03:09:54,090 --> 03:09:54,570
Oh, fuck!

4590
03:09:56,810 --> 03:09:57,490
Oh!

4591
03:09:57,970 --> 03:09:58,970
Shit, jellyfish!

4592
03:10:01,170 --> 03:10:02,050
It's okay.

4593
03:10:03,250 --> 03:10:05,590
What about the power of jellyfish?

4594
03:10:06,370 --> 03:10:07,430
I believe.

4595
03:10:10,270 --> 03:10:10,950
Nice!

4596
03:10:12,850 --> 03:10:15,270
Okay, I need to recover my stamina.

4597
03:10:15,870 --> 03:10:16,390
It's fine.

4598
03:10:19,590 --> 03:10:20,670
Jellyfish, please!

4599
03:10:21,290 --> 03:10:21,950
One hit!

4600
03:10:23,450 --> 03:10:24,710
Die by poison!

4601
03:10:26,550 --> 03:10:28,030
That's right, watch this!

4602
03:10:28,710 --> 03:10:31,730
My jellyfish will kill... I'm gonna watch my jellyfish 1v1.

4603
03:10:32,130 --> 03:10:33,570
You go, jellyfish!

4604
03:10:33,770 --> 03:10:35,110
You go, jellyfish!

4605
03:10:35,190 --> 03:10:36,090
1v1 him!

4606
03:10:36,450 --> 03:10:37,510
You got this!

4607
03:10:39,210 --> 03:10:39,930
Yay!

4608
03:10:42,270 --> 03:10:43,890
That's fucking right.

4609
03:10:45,090 --> 03:10:46,010
That's right!

4610
03:10:46,770 --> 03:10:48,960
You got beaten by my jellyfish!

4611
03:10:49,890 --> 03:10:50,950
It's a poke!

4612
03:10:51,090 --> 03:10:52,390
It's almost like Pokemon!

4613
03:10:52,970 --> 03:10:53,850
That's right!

4614
03:10:54,170 --> 03:10:56,010
I got my Pokemon battle!

4615
03:11:00,430 --> 03:11:01,970
Jellyfish, you's toxic!

4616
03:11:04,410 --> 03:11:05,030
Nice.

4617
03:11:06,650 --> 03:11:08,550
See you guys, it all worked out.

4618
03:11:08,950 --> 03:11:09,970
Oh nice, smithing stone.

4619
03:11:11,970 --> 03:11:13,650
Jellyfish, I choose you!

4620
03:11:17,460 --> 03:11:18,080
Okay.

4621
03:11:19,340 --> 03:11:20,580
Does he come back?

4622
03:11:21,360 --> 03:11:22,520
Does that...

4623
03:11:22,520 --> 03:11:24,140
Oh nice, a golden seed.

4624
03:11:25,100 --> 03:11:26,060
Raise the seal.

4625
03:11:26,780 --> 03:11:29,160
I'm just curious, does that guy respawn?

4626
03:11:29,640 --> 03:11:30,880
Does that guy...

4627
03:11:30,880 --> 03:11:31,400
Yes?

4628
03:11:31,880 --> 03:11:32,860
Oh shit!

4629
03:11:33,060 --> 03:11:34,680
Oh, so he's like a farming thing.

4630
03:11:35,600 --> 03:11:35,920
Oh!

4631
03:11:40,750 --> 03:11:42,070
Oh, I see.

4632
03:11:42,390 --> 03:11:43,410
So he's like a farmer.

4633
03:11:44,730 --> 03:11:45,790
Level up before fighting.

4634
03:11:46,150 --> 03:11:46,450
Oh wait.

4635
03:11:46,970 --> 03:11:47,990
Wait, is that another boss?

4636
03:11:48,190 --> 03:11:48,350
Okay.

4637
03:11:51,550 --> 03:11:52,550
1k runes?

4638
03:11:52,610 --> 03:11:53,770
That's so many runes!

4639
03:11:53,850 --> 03:11:54,970
I still don't have enough.

4640
03:11:55,350 --> 03:11:55,890
I...

4641
03:11:55,890 --> 03:11:59,030
I still don't have enough runes!

4642
03:11:59,070 --> 03:11:59,990
That's crazy!

4643
03:12:00,850 --> 03:12:01,410
Alright.

4644
03:12:01,690 --> 03:12:02,110
You know what?

4645
03:12:02,210 --> 03:12:04,290
I'll level up one more time before I do this.

4646
03:12:06,710 --> 03:12:08,030
I'll do it one more time.

4647
03:12:09,590 --> 03:12:10,710
I'll summon...

4648
03:12:10,710 --> 03:12:11,870
I'll summon jellyfish.

4649
03:12:14,990 --> 03:12:16,350
Go jellyfish, go.

4650
03:12:16,570 --> 03:12:18,010
It's your time to shine.

4651
03:12:25,530 --> 03:12:26,090
I...

4652
03:12:29,090 --> 03:12:30,770
Why did I turn around?

4653
03:12:31,110 --> 03:12:33,050
Why did I turn around?

4654
03:12:33,050 --> 03:12:34,510
I don't understand!

4655
03:12:35,530 --> 03:12:36,030
I don't understand!

4656
03:12:36,030 --> 03:12:37,390
How did I turn around?

4657
03:12:41,630 --> 03:12:42,750
I don't know!

4658
03:12:42,990 --> 03:12:44,250
I don't know to explain!

4659
03:12:44,750 --> 03:12:46,650
Someone explain how that happens!

4660
03:12:47,090 --> 03:12:48,330
Someone explain!

4661
03:12:48,750 --> 03:12:52,310
Someone rewatch the vine and tell me how I turned around!

4662
03:12:53,750 --> 03:12:55,690
What are you doing over here?

4663
03:12:55,830 --> 03:12:56,550
How did you...

4664
03:12:56,550 --> 03:12:58,250
How did you get here?

4665
03:13:02,590 --> 03:13:03,750
Oh my god!

4666
03:13:04,030 --> 03:13:05,130
He's right here!

4667
03:13:12,810 --> 03:13:14,230
I got enough money now?

4668
03:13:14,430 --> 03:13:15,390
Alright, let's fuck...

4669
03:13:15,390 --> 03:13:15,750
Fuck it.

4670
03:13:16,010 --> 03:13:17,490
I don't need to do anything.

4671
03:13:19,830 --> 03:13:20,350
Alright.

4672
03:13:20,910 --> 03:13:22,010
Okay, what do we get?

4673
03:13:22,330 --> 03:13:23,690
Dexterity or strength, guys?

4674
03:13:30,640 --> 03:13:32,780
She's just trying her best!

4675
03:13:37,180 --> 03:13:37,660
Dexterity?

4676
03:13:37,900 --> 03:13:38,740
Okay, dexterity.

4677
03:13:40,240 --> 03:13:41,200
More dexterity.

4678
03:13:42,320 --> 03:13:42,800
Okay.

4679
03:13:45,560 --> 03:13:46,580
Alright, let's go.

4680
03:13:46,920 --> 03:13:49,380
Let's see how many deaths they'll take us.

4681
03:13:49,860 --> 03:13:50,160
One!

4682
03:13:50,340 --> 03:13:50,640
Oh wait!

4683
03:13:50,800 --> 03:13:51,140
Do I have a...

4684
03:13:51,140 --> 03:13:52,980
I think I got a golden seed, too.

4685
03:13:54,280 --> 03:13:55,340
I'm pretty sure.

4686
03:13:57,000 --> 03:13:57,480
Uh...

4687
03:13:57,480 --> 03:13:58,080
Flask.

4688
03:13:58,460 --> 03:13:59,300
Did I not get one?

4689
03:13:59,620 --> 03:13:59,980
Yeah.

4690
03:14:00,200 --> 03:14:00,600
Oh, what?

4691
03:14:00,740 --> 03:14:00,900
No!

4692
03:14:01,000 --> 03:14:01,660
Oh, I need two!

4693
03:14:02,380 --> 03:14:03,340
Two now!

4694
03:14:03,340 --> 03:14:04,120
Oh!

4695
03:14:06,920 --> 03:14:07,520
Oh!

4696
03:14:09,440 --> 03:14:10,480
Did I get that?

4697
03:14:14,580 --> 03:14:15,860
I'm coming for you.

4698
03:14:16,420 --> 03:14:18,240
I'm coming for you!

4699
03:14:19,060 --> 03:14:20,160
Get over here!

4700
03:14:21,560 --> 03:14:22,500
Oh shit!

4701
03:14:28,050 --> 03:14:28,950
Oh my god!

4702
03:14:29,090 --> 03:14:29,990
He's actually 1 HP!

4703
03:14:30,490 --> 03:14:31,550
Are you fucking kidding me?

4704
03:14:31,550 --> 03:14:32,510
You can't do this to me!

4705
03:14:34,550 --> 03:14:35,570
Oh my god!

4706
03:14:35,850 --> 03:14:36,150
It's okay!

4707
03:14:36,470 --> 03:14:37,490
It was worth it!

4708
03:14:38,390 --> 03:14:38,770
Goodbye!

4709
03:14:39,510 --> 03:14:40,030
Goodbye!

4710
03:14:40,990 --> 03:14:42,370
It was worth it!

4711
03:14:43,130 --> 03:14:44,590
Wait, I didn't even pick it up!

4712
03:14:45,790 --> 03:14:46,630
Oh shit!

4713
03:14:47,370 --> 03:14:48,010
Oh shit!

4714
03:14:48,070 --> 03:14:48,970
I didn't even pick it up!

4715
03:14:51,190 --> 03:14:51,630
There's no way!

4716
03:14:51,630 --> 03:14:51,950
Oh no!

4717
03:14:52,670 --> 03:14:53,110
Wait!

4718
03:14:53,350 --> 03:14:54,650
There's no way he fits through that.

4719
03:14:54,850 --> 03:14:55,390
He's too wide!

4720
03:14:57,810 --> 03:14:58,510
There's no way!

4721
03:14:58,810 --> 03:15:00,370
There's no way you fit through this!

4722
03:15:00,530 --> 03:15:01,430
You're too fucking wide!

4723
03:15:06,530 --> 03:15:07,210
That's right!

4724
03:15:07,850 --> 03:15:09,110
You're too fucking wide!

4725
03:15:09,990 --> 03:15:11,070
That's right!

4726
03:15:11,310 --> 03:15:12,990
Time to go on a diet!

4727
03:15:16,150 --> 03:15:16,750
Boom!

4728
03:15:17,050 --> 03:15:17,490
Oh shit!

4729
03:15:17,690 --> 03:15:19,910
Okay, you might be too wide, but you still hit me.

4730
03:15:22,230 --> 03:15:24,090
Don't fight, David.

4731
03:15:24,450 --> 03:15:24,870
That's right!

4732
03:15:25,090 --> 03:15:27,070
Spin all you want, little man!

4733
03:15:27,930 --> 03:15:29,670
You can't get me!

4734
03:15:30,410 --> 03:15:31,690
Spin all you want!

4735
03:15:31,850 --> 03:15:32,290
Boom!

4736
03:15:39,270 --> 03:15:40,030
Oh shit!

4737
03:15:40,250 --> 03:15:41,010
Okay, I need to heal.

4738
03:15:42,230 --> 03:15:43,730
He's a chunky man.

4739
03:15:45,630 --> 03:15:47,210
Okay, I don't know how I can miss that.

4740
03:15:48,870 --> 03:15:50,730
What the fuck is the range?

4741
03:15:53,430 --> 03:15:53,870
Okay.

4742
03:15:54,590 --> 03:15:56,890
I still need to figure out the range in this.

4743
03:15:57,110 --> 03:15:58,730
Because it always fucks me up for some reason.

4744
03:15:58,910 --> 03:15:59,330
I don't know why.

4745
03:16:00,110 --> 03:16:01,770
I don't know why this fucks me up.

4746
03:16:05,650 --> 03:16:06,090
Doors!

4747
03:16:06,090 --> 03:16:08,070
Doors has yet again saved me!

4748
03:16:09,110 --> 03:16:09,410
Boom!

4749
03:16:09,870 --> 03:16:11,250
Slow and steady!

4750
03:16:11,610 --> 03:16:12,690
Good job, door!

4751
03:16:14,650 --> 03:16:16,410
Don't pull it!

4752
03:16:17,070 --> 03:16:18,010
Blast it!

4753
03:16:18,190 --> 03:16:19,150
That's fucking right!

4754
03:16:19,490 --> 03:16:20,230
Get doored!

4755
03:16:21,250 --> 03:16:21,470
Yeah!

4756
03:16:22,790 --> 03:16:24,610
Get fucking doored!

4757
03:16:25,790 --> 03:16:27,770
Why is it always Monarch?

4758
03:16:28,090 --> 03:16:29,410
Be wary of Liar?

4759
03:16:33,100 --> 03:16:35,240
Yeah, I need to get that item.

4760
03:16:38,790 --> 03:16:40,750
Let's get rid of one pot first.

4761
03:16:41,710 --> 03:16:43,830
And then we'll deal with...

4762
03:16:43,830 --> 03:16:44,890
There's so many pots!

4763
03:16:45,050 --> 03:16:45,510
Jesus Christ!

4764
03:16:48,630 --> 03:16:50,050
Oh wait, was that critical?

4765
03:16:50,410 --> 03:16:51,250
Oh shit!

4766
03:16:53,890 --> 03:16:55,050
That looked like a critical.

4767
03:16:59,010 --> 03:17:00,050
Yeah, that had to be!

4768
03:17:00,730 --> 03:17:01,570
Or a Sager?

4769
03:17:03,630 --> 03:17:05,390
Okay, they're all dangerous pots.

4770
03:17:08,490 --> 03:17:09,990
Oh, that was a guard break.

4771
03:17:10,170 --> 03:17:10,370
Okay.

4772
03:17:11,590 --> 03:17:12,070
That's right!

4773
03:17:12,130 --> 03:17:13,190
I know you're not real!

4774
03:17:14,130 --> 03:17:15,290
That's fucking right!

4775
03:17:15,450 --> 03:17:16,450
None of you are real!

4776
03:17:17,990 --> 03:17:19,290
Get out of here!

4777
03:17:20,870 --> 03:17:22,470
Okay, I got crackpot.

4778
03:17:23,190 --> 03:17:25,110
And I got another crackpot.

4779
03:17:25,610 --> 03:17:25,910
Nice.

4780
03:17:28,430 --> 03:17:30,230
I'll end the pot bloodline.

4781
03:17:33,230 --> 03:17:34,530
Inspect the strong folk.

4782
03:17:34,750 --> 03:17:37,130
Yeah, can't fucking walk through doorways though.

4783
03:17:37,350 --> 03:17:37,990
Am I going through here?

4784
03:17:38,090 --> 03:17:39,130
Or do I just fight the boss?

4785
03:17:40,890 --> 03:17:42,230
Oh, there's somebody over here.

4786
03:17:48,930 --> 03:17:49,650
Is there?

4787
03:17:50,050 --> 03:17:50,830
Press Q.

4788
03:17:51,010 --> 03:17:51,650
Okay, there's you.

4789
03:17:52,570 --> 03:17:53,370
There's you guys.

4790
03:17:56,110 --> 03:17:57,410
I could just fight the boss.

4791
03:17:57,410 --> 03:17:57,750
You know what?

4792
03:17:57,850 --> 03:17:58,390
Let's try it.

4793
03:17:59,230 --> 03:18:00,110
Let's try it.

4794
03:18:00,170 --> 03:18:01,150
I believe in us.

4795
03:18:01,670 --> 03:18:02,390
Wait, there's something here.

4796
03:18:02,590 --> 03:18:03,330
Oh, there's items here.

4797
03:18:07,790 --> 03:18:08,650
Oh, nice.

4798
03:18:10,590 --> 03:18:11,570
Try jumping?

4799
03:18:11,870 --> 03:18:12,210
Why?

4800
03:18:13,770 --> 03:18:15,150
Okay, I don't trust them.

4801
03:18:19,630 --> 03:18:21,050
Oh, right here!

4802
03:18:21,890 --> 03:18:22,870
Okay, I believe.

4803
03:18:27,450 --> 03:18:29,290
Okay, then we go this way.

4804
03:18:34,240 --> 03:18:35,320
And then...

4805
03:18:36,940 --> 03:18:37,340
I...

4806
03:18:37,340 --> 03:18:37,580
Oh, wait!

4807
03:18:37,700 --> 03:18:37,780
Oh!

4808
03:18:37,900 --> 03:18:38,560
Oh, we made it!

4809
03:18:38,680 --> 03:18:38,800
Okay.

4810
03:18:39,080 --> 03:18:39,960
I don't have to worry about...

4811
03:18:39,960 --> 03:18:41,580
Okay, that doesn't do much fall damage.

4812
03:18:41,700 --> 03:18:42,060
That's good.

4813
03:18:42,680 --> 03:18:43,100
Uh, Kaido!

4814
03:18:43,100 --> 03:18:44,360
Welcome to the tomato farm!

4815
03:18:44,500 --> 03:18:45,180
Welcome, welcome!

4816
03:18:45,540 --> 03:18:47,400
Okay, I was worried about the fall damage.

4817
03:18:48,520 --> 03:18:50,060
Okay, I have to run jump that.

4818
03:18:50,240 --> 03:18:50,940
Okay, now I know.

4819
03:18:52,060 --> 03:18:52,400
Okay.

4820
03:18:56,030 --> 03:18:56,430
Nice.

4821
03:18:57,450 --> 03:18:59,230
Time for jumping and then good luck.

4822
03:18:59,430 --> 03:18:59,830
Again?

4823
03:19:01,150 --> 03:19:01,870
Why again?

4824
03:19:05,810 --> 03:19:06,490
Wait, what?

4825
03:19:08,150 --> 03:19:09,330
Why jump again?

4826
03:19:09,550 --> 03:19:10,710
Oh, I don't like that.

4827
03:19:11,290 --> 03:19:12,590
I don't like that.

4828
03:19:12,710 --> 03:19:14,570
There's so many people who died there.

4829
03:19:19,760 --> 03:19:21,400
Try to make sure there's no enemies.

4830
03:19:21,940 --> 03:19:23,380
I'm pressing Q to make sure.

4831
03:19:23,560 --> 03:19:24,720
I'm trying to lock into enemies.

4832
03:19:26,560 --> 03:19:27,120
Oh.

4833
03:19:27,560 --> 03:19:27,900
Oh.

4834
03:19:29,100 --> 03:19:29,460
Okay.

4835
03:19:32,960 --> 03:19:33,620
Okay.

4836
03:19:33,940 --> 03:19:36,160
Oh, this is like a little place for parkour.

4837
03:19:40,310 --> 03:19:41,550
For surprise enemies.

4838
03:19:41,730 --> 03:19:42,250
Ooh, items!

4839
03:19:42,670 --> 03:19:43,170
Hello!

4840
03:19:44,390 --> 03:19:45,530
I like loot.

4841
03:19:47,590 --> 03:19:48,070
Okay.

4842
03:19:49,330 --> 03:19:50,230
Yay, loot!

4843
03:19:50,970 --> 03:19:51,630
Loot!

4844
03:19:52,010 --> 03:19:52,850
Loot, loot, loot.

4845
03:19:56,910 --> 03:20:00,290
I'm spamming my lock-on button to make sure...

4846
03:20:02,130 --> 03:20:02,790
Oh.

4847
03:20:05,290 --> 03:20:05,810
Oh.

4848
03:20:06,170 --> 03:20:07,410
I see you.

4849
03:20:10,610 --> 03:20:12,470
Oh, I see you guys.

4850
03:20:15,950 --> 03:20:17,130
That took me right.

4851
03:20:19,150 --> 03:20:19,690
Boom!

4852
03:20:20,570 --> 03:20:21,750
Didn't see me, did ya?

4853
03:20:23,110 --> 03:20:23,650
Boom!

4854
03:20:24,110 --> 03:20:24,570
Oh, fuck!

4855
03:20:24,770 --> 03:20:25,770
Oh, I didn't see you either!

4856
03:20:30,570 --> 03:20:31,970
Apparently I didn't see you too!

4857
03:20:33,510 --> 03:20:34,050
Okay.

4858
03:20:39,130 --> 03:20:39,970
Watch this.

4859
03:20:40,710 --> 03:20:41,250
Whoa!

4860
03:20:41,510 --> 03:20:42,030
Oh.

4861
03:20:43,870 --> 03:20:44,410
Sorry.

4862
03:20:44,610 --> 03:20:45,350
I closed my eyes.

4863
03:20:45,470 --> 03:20:45,890
What happened?

4864
03:20:48,710 --> 03:20:49,750
Guys, what happened?

4865
03:20:49,870 --> 03:20:50,690
I closed my eyes.

4866
03:20:51,150 --> 03:20:52,250
Did you guys see what happened?

4867
03:20:56,170 --> 03:20:57,250
I'm surprised.

4868
03:20:58,790 --> 03:20:59,850
Guys, what happened?

4869
03:21:02,550 --> 03:21:03,830
Sorry, my eyes were closed.

4870
03:21:04,030 --> 03:21:04,770
I don't know.

4871
03:21:09,490 --> 03:21:10,770
Be wary of, right?

4872
03:21:11,450 --> 03:21:12,650
Wait, where do I go?

4873
03:21:13,170 --> 03:21:13,490
Wait, no.

4874
03:21:13,530 --> 03:21:14,630
I came down from here.

4875
03:21:15,350 --> 03:21:15,630
Wait, no.

4876
03:21:15,730 --> 03:21:16,750
I came down...

4877
03:21:16,750 --> 03:21:17,190
Wait, yeah.

4878
03:21:17,350 --> 03:21:17,670
I came...

4879
03:21:17,670 --> 03:21:19,210
Where did these guys come from?

4880
03:21:20,670 --> 03:21:22,450
I came down from here?

4881
03:21:23,170 --> 03:21:25,450
Oh, they came down from here?

4882
03:21:26,390 --> 03:21:26,950
Oh, they came down from here.

4883
03:21:26,950 --> 03:21:27,450
Alright.

4884
03:21:28,850 --> 03:21:30,270
Oh, is it parkour time?

4885
03:21:30,610 --> 03:21:31,230
Oh, no.

4886
03:21:31,450 --> 03:21:32,950
Is this how all these people died?

4887
03:21:39,450 --> 03:21:40,010
Yeah.

4888
03:21:40,010 --> 03:21:40,970
Yeah.

4889
03:21:44,050 --> 03:21:44,570
Yeah.

4890
03:21:45,470 --> 03:21:45,950
Yeah.

4891
03:21:50,490 --> 03:21:51,770
Oh, guys.

4892
03:21:52,170 --> 03:21:54,790
I don't think we should do it because we have so many so...

4893
03:21:54,790 --> 03:21:56,530
Like, we have so many runes.

4894
03:21:56,710 --> 03:21:58,330
Let's leave that when we...

4895
03:21:58,330 --> 03:21:59,410
Don't worry.

4896
03:21:59,690 --> 03:22:01,550
It's not gonna happen to you.

4897
03:22:02,150 --> 03:22:06,870
Guys, I don't want to waste all the runes that I got from this area.

4898
03:22:10,010 --> 03:22:11,850
I can get it back easy.

4899
03:22:12,210 --> 03:22:13,450
Wait, how many runes do I have?

4900
03:22:13,610 --> 03:22:14,290
Okay, let me see.

4901
03:22:14,790 --> 03:22:15,590
How do I check?

4902
03:22:17,290 --> 03:22:19,310
How do I check how many runes I have?

4903
03:22:19,670 --> 03:22:20,690
I want to know.

4904
03:22:22,550 --> 03:22:24,030
Oh, I have 1,600.

4905
03:22:26,110 --> 03:22:27,910
Okay, we don't have a lot.

4906
03:22:28,150 --> 03:22:28,370
Okay.

4907
03:22:33,310 --> 03:22:34,310
Okay, guys.

4908
03:22:46,480 --> 03:22:46,960
Okay.

4909
03:22:55,650 --> 03:22:57,630
Do we jump from here or do we go down?

4910
03:23:00,530 --> 03:23:01,230
I don't know.

4911
03:23:01,370 --> 03:23:03,050
Do we jump from here or do we go downstairs?

4912
03:23:06,650 --> 03:23:07,090
Down?

4913
03:23:08,730 --> 03:23:09,170
Okay.

4914
03:23:13,780 --> 03:23:15,100
Wait, how did this guy die?

4915
03:23:20,420 --> 03:23:20,740
Oh.

4916
03:23:23,620 --> 03:23:24,540
Where did he go?

4917
03:23:29,260 --> 03:23:31,940
How did you die?

4918
03:23:36,200 --> 03:23:37,840
Where did he go?

4919
03:23:38,860 --> 03:23:39,880
He disappeared.

4920
03:23:39,880 --> 03:23:40,160
Here.

4921
03:23:58,410 --> 03:23:58,970
Okay.

4922
03:24:09,090 --> 03:24:11,670
Oh my god, that's so sad.

4923
03:24:12,910 --> 03:24:15,370
It's like, yo, that's like, that happened to me too!

4924
03:24:16,090 --> 03:24:17,590
It's like, oh my god!

4925
03:24:17,590 --> 03:24:19,370
Just like me!

4926
03:24:23,970 --> 03:24:24,570
Okay.

4927
03:24:25,330 --> 03:24:27,330
Now I'm there for a first stop.

4928
03:24:27,550 --> 03:24:28,050
Shortcut.

4929
03:24:28,830 --> 03:24:29,350
Wait, what?

4930
03:24:30,730 --> 03:24:33,110
I don't trust anyone!

4931
03:24:41,010 --> 03:24:42,990
I'm gonna open this door just in case.

4932
03:24:48,530 --> 03:24:50,450
Wait, where is this area?

4933
03:24:51,510 --> 03:24:52,790
Have I ever been here?

4934
03:24:53,890 --> 03:24:54,490
No!

4935
03:24:54,810 --> 03:24:56,550
Where the fuck is this area?

4936
03:25:03,910 --> 03:25:06,770
Oh, I skipped this when I was running!

4937
03:25:08,810 --> 03:25:09,450
Nice.

4938
03:25:10,230 --> 03:25:11,610
I've never been here.

4939
03:25:11,770 --> 03:25:15,250
I was like, where did I, where did this area come from?

4940
03:25:15,490 --> 03:25:17,390
I just, I just ran.

4941
03:25:19,030 --> 03:25:20,750
Invisible sword ahead?

4942
03:25:22,790 --> 03:25:23,630
What do you mean?

4943
03:25:32,830 --> 03:25:34,710
Oh, I can lob up one and pop the rune?

4944
03:25:34,850 --> 03:25:35,330
Oh, okay.

4945
03:25:35,330 --> 03:25:36,010
I'll do that.

4946
03:25:37,210 --> 03:25:37,770
I'll do that.

4947
03:25:39,030 --> 03:25:39,530
Uh...

4948
03:25:39,530 --> 03:25:40,530
Inventory.

4949
03:25:40,970 --> 03:25:41,970
Where's my rune?

4950
03:25:44,370 --> 03:25:45,330
Oh, this one?

4951
03:25:45,730 --> 03:25:46,970
Oh no, that's my golden seed.

4952
03:25:47,070 --> 03:25:47,670
Where's the rune?

4953
03:25:51,980 --> 03:25:53,660
And that's the golden seed.

4954
03:25:56,740 --> 03:25:57,960
The gold circles?

4955
03:25:58,300 --> 03:25:59,460
Oh, here it is!

4956
03:25:59,920 --> 03:26:00,960
Can I just pop all of these?

4957
03:26:07,500 --> 03:26:09,100
Okay, I'll pop all of it.

4958
03:26:10,440 --> 03:26:10,920
Boom!

4959
03:26:12,040 --> 03:26:13,120
Okay, and then...

4960
03:26:14,040 --> 03:26:15,280
Let me pop the rest.

4961
03:26:18,590 --> 03:26:19,790
Let's pop all of it.

4962
03:26:21,010 --> 03:26:21,310
Yay!

4963
03:26:22,870 --> 03:26:23,790
And then...

4964
03:26:23,790 --> 03:26:24,190
Oh, I can.

4965
03:26:24,350 --> 03:26:25,350
After this last pop.

4966
03:26:26,950 --> 03:26:28,110
I should be able to.

4967
03:26:33,930 --> 03:26:34,390
Yeah.

4968
03:26:35,770 --> 03:26:37,190
Okay, now I should have enough.

4969
03:26:39,430 --> 03:26:39,890
Uh...

4970
03:26:39,890 --> 03:26:40,230
Alright.

4971
03:26:41,510 --> 03:26:41,970
Dexterity.

4972
03:26:41,990 --> 03:26:43,550
Do we just keep going with dexterity?

4973
03:26:44,330 --> 03:26:45,830
Yeah, I just got enough.

4974
03:26:47,730 --> 03:26:49,110
I have more in the next tab?

4975
03:26:49,350 --> 03:26:49,550
Really?

4976
03:26:51,850 --> 03:26:52,310
Ugh!

4977
03:26:53,570 --> 03:26:54,670
Dexterity, the 20.

4978
03:26:54,890 --> 03:26:55,730
Okay, I'll do that.

4979
03:26:59,690 --> 03:27:00,250
Alright.

4980
03:27:01,570 --> 03:27:02,130
Nice.

4981
03:27:09,870 --> 03:27:12,030
God, it's so hard to trust people.

4982
03:27:14,310 --> 03:27:16,430
This is where trust issues start.

4983
03:27:20,490 --> 03:27:21,570
Here we go.

4984
03:27:22,190 --> 03:27:22,870
Wait, not there.

4985
03:27:23,150 --> 03:27:23,430
Okay.

4986
03:27:24,290 --> 03:27:25,090
But it's...

4987
03:27:25,090 --> 03:27:26,890
Was this message lying?

4988
03:27:26,890 --> 03:27:28,190
Don't...

4989
03:27:28,190 --> 03:27:30,550
You mean this message lied to me?

4990
03:27:30,850 --> 03:27:32,910
Oh, bad message.

4991
03:27:33,690 --> 03:27:35,050
Bad message!

4992
03:27:39,630 --> 03:27:40,710
That's it.

4993
03:27:41,050 --> 03:27:42,210
I'm mad.

4994
03:27:55,890 --> 03:27:56,630
There we go.

4995
03:27:56,630 --> 03:27:57,570
Now's my turn.

4996
03:27:57,830 --> 03:27:58,550
That...

4997
03:27:58,550 --> 03:28:00,210
What is this?

4998
03:28:04,190 --> 03:28:05,910
But my...

4999
03:28:05,910 --> 03:28:07,990
That continued the cycle.

5000
03:28:08,870 --> 03:28:09,270
The...

5001
03:28:09,270 --> 03:28:10,530
Two...

5002
03:28:10,530 --> 03:28:11,630
Bad messages.

5003
03:28:16,370 --> 03:28:18,470
The cycle continues.

5004
03:28:19,030 --> 03:28:21,670
He needs another one to reinforce it.

5005
03:28:21,670 --> 03:28:26,850
Guys, if y'all get praised that specific message, just think about how many people we'll kill.

5006
03:28:27,010 --> 03:28:27,930
It'll be so funny.

5007
03:28:32,290 --> 03:28:34,790
Guys, it'd be so funny.

5008
03:28:35,050 --> 03:28:39,290
Think about how many people we're gonna kill with that trip.

5009
03:28:39,590 --> 03:28:40,550
We all upvoted.

5010
03:28:44,430 --> 03:28:46,070
It'd be so funny.

5011
03:28:46,290 --> 03:28:47,150
OH SHIT!

5012
03:28:47,150 --> 03:28:48,230
Oh my god!

5013
03:28:50,230 --> 03:28:52,370
I almost jumped up.

5014
03:28:53,070 --> 03:28:55,210
I almost backed up.

5015
03:28:58,270 --> 03:28:59,510
What the fuck?

5016
03:28:59,910 --> 03:29:01,110
What did he do?

5017
03:29:02,270 --> 03:29:03,910
Oh, he fell off.

5018
03:29:04,110 --> 03:29:04,250
Okay.

5019
03:29:04,930 --> 03:29:05,790
Try target lock?

5020
03:29:06,110 --> 03:29:06,270
Oh.

5021
03:29:07,170 --> 03:29:08,870
Oh, I see you.

5022
03:29:09,170 --> 03:29:10,270
How do I kill him?

5023
03:29:16,770 --> 03:29:18,530
How do I kill this guy?

5024
03:29:19,910 --> 03:29:21,030
I have a bow.

5025
03:29:21,310 --> 03:29:22,710
I have to waste my bow?

5026
03:29:23,290 --> 03:29:24,330
God damn it.

5027
03:29:30,550 --> 03:29:31,030
Okay.

5028
03:29:35,070 --> 03:29:35,910
Oh, you're right.

5029
03:29:35,990 --> 03:29:36,610
I could charge attack.

5030
03:29:36,890 --> 03:29:37,350
It's too late.

5031
03:29:40,030 --> 03:29:40,870
There we go.

5032
03:29:41,410 --> 03:29:42,230
It's too late.

5033
03:29:43,030 --> 03:29:43,710
You were right.

5034
03:29:43,710 --> 03:29:44,710
I could charge attack.

5035
03:29:46,170 --> 03:29:47,810
Oh, it's just for that guy?

5036
03:29:49,690 --> 03:29:53,750
Be wary of, uh...

5037
03:29:53,750 --> 03:29:55,930
That's a long way down.

5038
03:29:59,430 --> 03:30:00,010
Oh!

5039
03:30:00,610 --> 03:30:00,810
Whoa!

5040
03:30:01,090 --> 03:30:01,390
Whoa!

5041
03:30:01,550 --> 03:30:03,230
He didn't tell me to be wary of that!

5042
03:30:05,350 --> 03:30:06,050
Okay, wait.

5043
03:30:07,730 --> 03:30:09,050
I don't think he can fly up.

5044
03:30:10,150 --> 03:30:11,350
Yeah, I don't think so either.

5045
03:30:12,430 --> 03:30:13,510
Yeah, he's stuck down there.

5046
03:30:17,860 --> 03:30:19,220
Yeah, he's a little stupid.

5047
03:30:20,300 --> 03:30:21,880
Okay, I can use another bow then.

5048
03:30:27,960 --> 03:30:28,360
Stupid.

5049
03:30:29,460 --> 03:30:30,160
Here we go.

5050
03:30:31,900 --> 03:30:32,860
Get over here.

5051
03:30:33,020 --> 03:30:33,640
Head shot.

5052
03:30:35,540 --> 03:30:36,240
Come on!

5053
03:30:38,500 --> 03:30:39,220
Come on!

5054
03:30:42,490 --> 03:30:42,970
Bro!

5055
03:30:43,550 --> 03:30:44,410
Get over here!

5056
03:30:44,830 --> 03:30:46,070
Oh my god, he's just sticking out here.

5057
03:30:47,090 --> 03:30:48,630
Oh my god, I feel like I'm gonna accidentally fall now.

5058
03:30:50,810 --> 03:30:51,490
I...

5059
03:30:56,490 --> 03:30:59,890
Okay, now he's just purposely dodging me.

5060
03:31:02,350 --> 03:31:04,290
Like, now that's on purpose!

5061
03:31:08,930 --> 03:31:09,610
Bro!

5062
03:31:14,950 --> 03:31:16,490
Okay, that's fucked up.

5063
03:31:17,850 --> 03:31:19,070
I wanna hit him.

5064
03:31:19,250 --> 03:31:20,450
I wanna shoot him.

5065
03:31:21,970 --> 03:31:23,190
More fun this way.

5066
03:31:23,190 --> 03:31:24,890
I'm gonna accidentally back up.

5067
03:31:25,010 --> 03:31:26,030
I know, I know I am.

5068
03:31:33,570 --> 03:31:35,830
Oh my god, I hate this.

5069
03:31:36,050 --> 03:31:37,710
I accidentally used my two arrows!

5070
03:31:41,580 --> 03:31:42,460
That's it, I'm mad.

5071
03:31:43,660 --> 03:31:45,060
I'm mad now.

5072
03:31:45,660 --> 03:31:46,700
I'm mad!

5073
03:31:47,340 --> 03:31:48,520
Get over here.

5074
03:31:50,840 --> 03:31:51,800
There we go.

5075
03:31:52,180 --> 03:31:53,280
I could've just done that.

5076
03:31:57,740 --> 03:32:00,740
Yeah, but my other arrows are strong arrows.

5077
03:32:00,820 --> 03:32:02,050
That's different.

5078
03:32:03,660 --> 03:32:04,760
Where did he die?

5079
03:32:07,440 --> 03:32:08,060
What?

5080
03:32:09,640 --> 03:32:10,260
What?

5081
03:32:12,700 --> 03:32:13,320
What?

5082
03:32:13,320 --> 03:32:14,580
What the f- What?

5083
03:32:17,330 --> 03:32:19,290
How many are you- Are there?

5084
03:32:22,930 --> 03:32:24,390
Wait, I can do this one.

5085
03:32:33,350 --> 03:32:35,050
Wait, is this worth it?

5086
03:32:36,430 --> 03:32:37,110
Wait, is this worth it?

5087
03:32:37,110 --> 03:32:39,510
Is this- Is this worth it?

5088
03:32:41,650 --> 03:32:42,330
Wait.

5089
03:32:44,090 --> 03:32:46,730
No, don't do what that guy did.

5090
03:32:47,170 --> 03:32:49,950
Is it- Is it worth it though?

5091
03:32:50,130 --> 03:33:03,670
Is it actually- Is it- How badly you wanna find out- I- I don't- I don't- I don't know if- I don't know if- I don't know if it's worth it.

5092
03:33:03,810 --> 03:33:05,190
It doesn't seem worth it.

5093
03:33:05,850 --> 03:33:08,010
No, there's another way down!

5094
03:33:09,210 --> 03:33:10,270
Okay.

5095
03:33:11,430 --> 03:33:12,490
Okay.

5096
03:33:12,490 --> 03:33:12,850
Fuck, okay.

5097
03:33:15,960 --> 03:33:16,490
Okay.

5098
03:33:16,970 --> 03:33:17,530
Okay.

5099
03:33:17,930 --> 03:33:19,390
Okay, we got that.

5100
03:33:21,810 --> 03:33:22,870
Alright.

5101
03:33:23,070 --> 03:33:23,710
Okay.

5102
03:33:24,350 --> 03:33:24,850
Okay.

5103
03:33:25,490 --> 03:33:25,850
Okay.

5104
03:33:25,850 --> 03:33:26,170
Okay.

5105
03:33:33,170 --> 03:33:35,590
Why is it always a rat- No!

5106
03:33:36,230 --> 03:33:38,190
No, not the rats!

5107
03:33:38,570 --> 03:33:40,430
Not the fucking rats!

5108
03:33:40,870 --> 03:33:43,610
Are you fucking- Is this rat territory?

5109
03:33:44,150 --> 03:33:45,710
Ah, I see them!

5110
03:33:46,030 --> 03:33:47,310
I see the rats!

5111
03:33:47,610 --> 03:33:48,910
I see them!

5112
03:33:49,450 --> 03:33:50,830
Are they poisonous?

5113
03:33:51,350 --> 03:33:53,810
Is this poison- Ah, I'm using the bathroom.

5114
03:33:53,810 --> 03:33:54,510
Fuck this.

5115
03:33:54,510 --> 03:33:55,190
Be right-

5116
03:33:58,510 --> 03:33:59,670
I'll be right back.

5117
03:35:17,600 --> 03:35:19,400
Sorry, I had to go- I forgot to get water.

5118
03:35:19,860 --> 03:35:21,000
I got my water though.

5119
03:35:21,420 --> 03:35:21,720
Oh my god.

5120
03:35:21,720 --> 03:35:24,400
Are we appraising that one message where I told people to jump?

5121
03:35:27,160 --> 03:35:27,640
Good.

5122
03:35:29,780 --> 03:35:31,620
We continue the cycle.

5123
03:35:37,740 --> 03:35:38,600
Upvote it, please.

5124
03:35:38,960 --> 03:35:40,840
I want to see how many people will jump.

5125
03:35:40,840 --> 03:35:42,440
I can't-

5126
03:35:46,260 --> 03:35:49,140
Wait, I'm just gonna- Fuck it.

5127
03:35:49,360 --> 03:35:50,320
I'm gonna waste my arrows.

5128
03:35:50,780 --> 03:35:51,440
Can't be bothered.

5129
03:35:54,820 --> 03:35:55,820
Wait, what?

5130
03:35:56,180 --> 03:35:57,540
How do I swap my arrows?

5131
03:35:58,820 --> 03:36:00,160
You have arrows!

5132
03:36:01,740 --> 03:36:03,280
How do I swap it?

5133
03:36:07,540 --> 03:36:08,220
Autodock?

5134
03:36:08,480 --> 03:36:10,340
Yeah, but it's not swapping my arrows.

5135
03:36:12,880 --> 03:36:14,300
I don't know how to swap my ammo.

5136
03:36:15,280 --> 03:36:15,880
Oh!

5137
03:36:17,160 --> 03:36:18,260
There we go.

5138
03:36:23,790 --> 03:36:24,390
Whoops.

5139
03:36:25,750 --> 03:36:26,650
Do you think they know this?

5140
03:36:27,370 --> 03:36:28,290
Who's that, Jerry?

5141
03:36:28,670 --> 03:36:29,570
I don't know.

5142
03:36:32,990 --> 03:36:34,790
He's like, who's that?

5143
03:36:37,010 --> 03:36:38,210
What was?

5144
03:36:40,050 --> 03:36:42,170
Do you think they know?

5145
03:36:44,670 --> 03:36:46,130
I don't know, I'm tired.

5146
03:36:47,150 --> 03:36:49,330
Let's just go back to being rats.

5147
03:36:49,650 --> 03:36:50,250
Rats.

5148
03:36:50,470 --> 03:36:50,950
Rats.

5149
03:36:51,090 --> 03:36:52,250
We are the rats.

5150
03:36:54,470 --> 03:36:57,550
First up, is something incredible then be wary of...

5151
03:36:58,090 --> 03:36:58,630
What?

5152
03:36:59,310 --> 03:37:00,630
How did they all die?

5153
03:37:02,250 --> 03:37:03,770
How did they...

5154
03:37:03,770 --> 03:37:04,550
Wait.

5155
03:37:05,010 --> 03:37:06,630
How did they all die?

5156
03:37:06,970 --> 03:37:08,390
Was it the rats?

5157
03:37:10,430 --> 03:37:11,530
Oh, no.

5158
03:37:11,830 --> 03:37:13,670
I think it was the rats, guys.

5159
03:37:19,530 --> 03:37:20,950
Oh my god.

5160
03:37:21,890 --> 03:37:23,870
I think it's the rats.

5161
03:37:24,170 --> 03:37:25,950
I'm so worried.

5162
03:37:26,230 --> 03:37:27,490
I'm so worried.

5163
03:37:29,610 --> 03:37:31,330
How did they all die?

5164
03:37:31,770 --> 03:37:33,490
How did they all die?

5165
03:37:33,490 --> 03:37:37,070
There's so many rats ahead.

5166
03:37:40,690 --> 03:37:41,250
Oh!

5167
03:37:41,370 --> 03:37:42,050
That was a rat!

5168
03:37:42,230 --> 03:37:43,130
It was the rat!

5169
03:37:43,530 --> 03:37:44,830
It was the rat!

5170
03:37:44,830 --> 03:37:44,990
It was the rat!

5171
03:37:45,490 --> 03:37:46,610
Holy shit!

5172
03:37:46,750 --> 03:37:48,210
That's a big-ass rat!

5173
03:37:48,210 --> 03:37:49,750
What the hell?

5174
03:37:51,530 --> 03:37:52,470
Oh my god.

5175
03:37:52,910 --> 03:37:54,330
Oh my god.

5176
03:37:54,470 --> 03:37:55,170
I know now.

5177
03:37:55,730 --> 03:37:56,430
Yep.

5178
03:37:57,910 --> 03:38:00,810
I was like, how did they die to a rat?

5179
03:38:01,170 --> 03:38:01,890
LOL.

5180
03:38:03,170 --> 03:38:04,150
That's out.

5181
03:38:04,670 --> 03:38:05,930
Oh my god.

5182
03:38:07,210 --> 03:38:07,430
Oh my god.

5183
03:38:08,030 --> 03:38:08,390
Alright.

5184
03:38:08,590 --> 03:38:09,610
We figured it out.

5185
03:38:09,810 --> 03:38:10,510
It was...

5186
03:38:13,190 --> 03:38:13,510
Alright.

5187
03:38:13,790 --> 03:38:13,990
Nice.

5188
03:38:14,750 --> 03:38:15,290
Okay.

5189
03:38:15,490 --> 03:38:16,570
It was a giant rat.

5190
03:38:17,550 --> 03:38:19,350
You're like, something shining.

5191
03:38:20,150 --> 03:38:20,750
Rat down.

5192
03:38:20,990 --> 03:38:22,770
Welcome to New York City.

5193
03:38:26,590 --> 03:38:28,630
Yeah, but like, 800 people died.

5194
03:38:29,110 --> 03:38:29,690
You're up ahead?

5195
03:38:34,020 --> 03:38:37,640
I was confused how so many people died in this one area.

5196
03:38:46,600 --> 03:38:47,550
I'm so paranoid.

5197
03:38:53,480 --> 03:38:53,850
Run!

5198
03:38:54,310 --> 03:38:55,270
No running!

5199
03:38:56,870 --> 03:38:57,370
Okay.

5200
03:38:58,810 --> 03:38:59,410
Nice.

5201
03:39:01,170 --> 03:39:01,690
Okay.

5202
03:39:04,060 --> 03:39:04,870
I'm so paranoid.

5203
03:39:05,130 --> 03:39:06,110
I'm spamming Q, guys.

5204
03:39:06,970 --> 03:39:08,210
I'm spamming Q.

5205
03:39:08,210 --> 03:39:09,030
I gotta be sure.

5206
03:39:13,130 --> 03:39:13,410
God.

5207
03:39:13,650 --> 03:39:14,510
What's this?

5208
03:39:15,180 --> 03:39:17,730
There's so many bodies here.

5209
03:39:19,190 --> 03:39:20,810
There's so many.

5210
03:39:21,560 --> 03:39:23,290
There's so many bodies.

5211
03:39:26,870 --> 03:39:28,250
Oh no.

5212
03:39:28,770 --> 03:39:30,230
That's a graveyard.

5213
03:39:33,370 --> 03:39:34,770
That's a...

5214
03:39:35,260 --> 03:39:36,850
Where's my golden trail?

5215
03:39:40,640 --> 03:39:42,030
This is a bot...

5216
03:39:43,220 --> 03:39:44,230
There's no way.

5217
03:39:48,630 --> 03:39:48,930
What?

5218
03:39:53,170 --> 03:39:55,010
But look at the loot though.

5219
03:39:55,290 --> 03:39:56,550
Look at the loot.

5220
03:40:00,770 --> 03:40:01,750
Where's the...

5221
03:40:01,750 --> 03:40:02,230
How do...

5222
03:40:02,230 --> 03:40:03,190
There's no save point!

5223
03:40:03,890 --> 03:40:06,470
How is this a boss point with no save point?

5224
03:40:09,270 --> 03:40:09,870
Oh.

5225
03:40:11,330 --> 03:40:13,470
Oh, I see that guy rolling.

5226
03:40:13,790 --> 03:40:14,970
I see him roll.

5227
03:40:15,130 --> 03:40:17,070
He's doing the same thing I am.

5228
03:40:21,250 --> 03:40:25,170
He's going through the same thing I'm going through right now.

5229
03:40:28,850 --> 03:40:29,570
Okay.

5230
03:40:31,750 --> 03:40:33,310
Guess I go down.

5231
03:40:34,630 --> 03:40:35,350
Oh my god.

5232
03:40:35,650 --> 03:40:36,330
Jellyfish.

5233
03:40:43,670 --> 03:40:45,450
Oh my god!

5234
03:40:45,810 --> 03:40:46,410
Oh my god!

5235
03:40:46,550 --> 03:40:47,690
How is he easy?

5236
03:40:47,930 --> 03:40:48,870
He's so big!

5237
03:40:49,990 --> 03:40:51,410
Oh my god!

5238
03:40:51,650 --> 03:40:52,830
What do you mean?

5239
03:40:53,330 --> 03:40:54,670
Where's my jellyfish?

5240
03:40:54,670 --> 03:40:55,170
What?

5241
03:40:56,890 --> 03:40:57,530
Ah!

5242
03:40:58,390 --> 03:40:58,610
Ah!

5243
03:41:04,680 --> 03:41:05,000
Ah!

5244
03:41:05,100 --> 03:41:05,360
Freeze me!

5245
03:41:05,780 --> 03:41:06,020
Stop!

5246
03:41:22,400 --> 03:41:29,480
What the... I forgot where the messages were.

5247
03:41:33,700 --> 03:41:35,100
Thank you, guys.

5248
03:41:35,540 --> 03:41:37,260
Thank you for the appraisals.

5249
03:41:37,460 --> 03:41:39,420
I really appreciate it.

5250
03:41:39,860 --> 03:41:40,700
Thank you, guys.

5251
03:41:40,700 --> 03:41:42,240
Oh, my God.

5252
03:41:42,420 --> 03:41:43,000
Wow.

5253
03:41:43,420 --> 03:41:45,460
Thanks for the appraisals, everybody.

5254
03:41:45,780 --> 03:41:46,600
Thank you.

5255
03:41:46,720 --> 03:41:48,120
Thank you, everyone.

5256
03:41:48,560 --> 03:41:50,420
They really helped out.

5257
03:41:51,000 --> 03:41:51,520
For sure.

5258
03:41:52,040 --> 03:41:53,020
They really did.

5259
03:41:55,620 --> 03:41:59,260
I feel very helped out.

5260
03:42:05,520 --> 03:42:07,760
Oh, my God.

5261
03:42:08,100 --> 03:42:12,600
Thanks for playing Elden Ring with us.

5262
03:42:13,060 --> 03:42:15,120
Skarden, thank you for the super chat.

5263
03:42:15,380 --> 03:42:15,780
Thank you.

5264
03:42:16,080 --> 03:42:16,540
Thank you.

5265
03:42:16,900 --> 03:42:19,500
Where the fuck were my appraisals?

5266
03:42:20,820 --> 03:42:22,880
I was lied to.

5267
03:42:25,560 --> 03:42:26,940
Oh, yeah.

5268
03:42:27,920 --> 03:42:30,280
I can't believe it.

5269
03:42:31,940 --> 03:42:34,580
I don't know how I keep missing those shots.

5270
03:42:37,140 --> 03:42:38,380
There you go.

5271
03:42:38,900 --> 03:42:40,280
I'm so sad.

5272
03:42:40,620 --> 03:42:41,580
Oh, my God.

5273
03:42:44,580 --> 03:42:46,640
Alright, there's a giant rat.

5274
03:42:47,680 --> 03:42:48,180
Rat.

5275
03:42:48,820 --> 03:42:49,300
Rat.

5276
03:42:49,860 --> 03:42:49,860
Rat.

5277
03:42:50,300 --> 03:42:51,700
Get out of here.

5278
03:42:52,540 --> 03:42:52,940
Nice.

5279
03:42:53,940 --> 03:42:55,160
Oh, my God.

5280
03:42:55,400 --> 03:42:56,200
It hit me?

5281
03:42:57,480 --> 03:42:58,100
Okay.

5282
03:42:59,320 --> 03:43:00,240
That's fine.

5283
03:43:01,580 --> 03:43:06,440
Why did no... Why did none of these messages say anything about this giant fucking thing up there?

5284
03:43:10,580 --> 03:43:11,820
Get ratted.

5285
03:43:12,840 --> 03:43:14,980
I'm tired of getting ratted.

5286
03:43:16,500 --> 03:43:18,800
Wait, there was a parkour area right here.

5287
03:43:21,760 --> 03:43:22,720
I'm headed to nowhere.

5288
03:43:22,900 --> 03:43:24,060
Be wary of high spot?

5289
03:43:25,180 --> 03:43:25,660
Why?

5290
03:43:29,390 --> 03:43:30,470
What's this even for?

5291
03:43:33,490 --> 03:43:35,650
Why is it always...

5292
03:43:35,650 --> 03:43:35,810
...mess?

5293
03:43:39,570 --> 03:43:40,290
Let's go!

5294
03:43:40,530 --> 03:43:41,970
Thank you for the five gift of ships.

5295
03:43:42,090 --> 03:43:42,890
Thank you, thank you.

5296
03:43:42,950 --> 03:43:45,670
Yeah, but like, what is this fucking high ground even for?

5297
03:43:46,310 --> 03:43:47,230
It's for nothing.

5298
03:43:51,070 --> 03:43:52,370
Therefore, do it.

5299
03:43:53,650 --> 03:43:54,050
Whoa.

5300
03:43:57,530 --> 03:43:58,610
Can I just run through it?

5301
03:43:58,730 --> 03:43:59,770
Maybe I can just run through it.

5302
03:44:01,070 --> 03:44:02,950
Maybe I can just... Oh, fuck!

5303
03:44:04,210 --> 03:44:05,650
Maybe he can't go through this.

5304
03:44:08,470 --> 03:44:10,130
Maybe I can just run through this.

5305
03:44:11,430 --> 03:44:11,830
Maybe...

5306
03:44:14,350 --> 03:44:15,670
Maybe I can just...

5307
03:44:15,670 --> 03:44:16,990
Guys, stop appraising!

5308
03:44:17,030 --> 03:44:17,590
I'm okay!

5309
03:44:22,150 --> 03:44:22,630
Wait.

5310
03:44:23,130 --> 03:44:24,510
But where do I go afterwards?

5311
03:44:25,290 --> 03:44:26,230
Does he know I'm here?

5312
03:44:26,390 --> 03:44:29,070
Oh my god, there's a ladder right there.

5313
03:44:32,850 --> 03:44:34,210
I don't think he can see me.

5314
03:44:34,530 --> 03:44:35,390
I don't think...

5315
03:44:36,110 --> 03:44:36,910
This is it.

5316
03:44:37,110 --> 03:44:37,950
This is it.

5317
03:44:38,090 --> 03:44:38,870
This is it.

5318
03:44:39,750 --> 03:44:40,230
No!

5319
03:44:40,590 --> 03:44:40,710
No!

5320
03:44:41,050 --> 03:44:41,470
Climb!

5321
03:44:41,830 --> 03:44:42,850
Climb, you fool!

5322
03:44:42,850 --> 03:44:44,190
Climb!

5323
03:44:44,330 --> 03:44:46,190
Keep climbing, you fool!

5324
03:44:46,510 --> 03:44:47,330
Keep climbing!

5325
03:44:48,090 --> 03:44:49,510
Keep climbing!

5326
03:44:49,510 --> 03:44:50,030
Keep climbing!

5327
03:44:52,470 --> 03:44:53,510
Climb!

5328
03:44:54,350 --> 03:44:55,650
Pass it!

5329
03:44:57,830 --> 03:44:59,470
Climb for your life!

5330
03:45:03,730 --> 03:45:05,650
We'll come back later.

5331
03:45:06,230 --> 03:45:07,870
We'll come back later.

5332
03:45:09,890 --> 03:45:11,690
What a thrill!

5333
03:45:12,490 --> 03:45:13,690
What a...

5334
03:45:14,870 --> 03:45:17,330
Oh my god, it's so high up!

5335
03:45:17,750 --> 03:45:19,850
Why is it so high up?

5336
03:45:26,500 --> 03:45:27,650
We're so...

5337
03:45:28,700 --> 03:45:30,270
It's like a dream!

5338
03:45:31,470 --> 03:45:32,690
Snake eater!

5339
03:45:34,730 --> 03:45:35,370
What's down here?

5340
03:45:35,370 --> 03:45:37,030
Wait, I can't go back down from here.

5341
03:45:40,390 --> 03:45:41,930
Wait, what's down here?

5342
03:45:47,460 --> 03:45:50,220
Guys, what the fuck is down here?

5343
03:45:50,680 --> 03:45:54,220
I... By

5344
03:45:57,890 --> 03:45:59,770
the way, be wary of enemy?

5345
03:46:00,090 --> 03:46:01,390
Where am I?

5346
03:46:04,430 --> 03:46:06,410
Where the fuck am I?

5347
03:46:15,970 --> 03:46:19,770
This has to be a... Okay, I can't go through here.

5348
03:46:27,400 --> 03:46:27,880
Okay.

5349
03:46:28,460 --> 03:46:29,240
Wait, open the guard.

5350
03:46:29,480 --> 03:46:29,620
Oh.

5351
03:46:30,840 --> 03:46:31,140
Okay.

5352
03:46:45,420 --> 03:46:47,220
There's no way he can get through this door.

5353
03:46:49,260 --> 03:46:50,200
Oh, shit.

5354
03:46:51,720 --> 03:46:53,120
Oh my god, he can.

5355
03:46:55,540 --> 03:46:56,300
There you go.

5356
03:46:56,740 --> 03:46:57,420
I got it.

5357
03:46:58,280 --> 03:46:58,800
I don't know.

5358
03:46:58,880 --> 03:47:01,080
He seemed really fucking big for some reason.

5359
03:47:04,530 --> 03:47:06,070
I don't think he knows I'm here.

5360
03:47:08,650 --> 03:47:10,170
I don't think he saw me.

5361
03:47:19,850 --> 03:47:20,990
Where did he go?

5362
03:47:22,330 --> 03:47:24,190
Where the fuck did he go?

5363
03:47:25,290 --> 03:47:27,310
I knew he didn't see me.

5364
03:47:27,870 --> 03:47:29,110
I knew it.

5365
03:47:31,650 --> 03:47:32,170
Nice.

5366
03:47:35,500 --> 03:47:36,260
Oh, nice.

5367
03:47:36,260 --> 03:47:36,440
Nice.

5368
03:47:36,620 --> 03:47:37,760
That's so many things.

5369
03:47:38,600 --> 03:47:39,580
Liar ahead?

5370
03:47:40,480 --> 03:47:41,120
Oh.

5371
03:47:45,040 --> 03:47:46,140
There you go.

5372
03:47:51,330 --> 03:47:53,070
Time for jumping off.

5373
03:47:54,370 --> 03:47:59,910
Oh, it's... I would... That's what he meant.

5374
03:48:00,430 --> 03:48:01,690
Liar ahead.

5375
03:48:02,390 --> 03:48:04,670
Wait, I should... Wait, I got an idea.

5376
03:48:04,910 --> 03:48:06,250
I got an idea, too.

5377
03:48:16,940 --> 03:48:20,080
Try... Wait, I want to be like, he's right.

5378
03:48:20,620 --> 03:48:22,360
Is there like...

5379
03:48:22,360 --> 03:48:24,780
Um... No liar ahead.

5380
03:48:25,900 --> 03:48:26,660
No...

5381
03:48:28,560 --> 03:48:30,520
No liar ahead.

5382
03:48:31,280 --> 03:48:32,040
There you go.

5383
03:48:37,000 --> 03:48:38,140
There you go.

5384
03:48:39,400 --> 03:48:42,580
There was... Guys... No, there wasn't a liar.

5385
03:48:43,000 --> 03:48:44,520
It said so.

5386
03:48:46,800 --> 03:48:47,940
He's right.

5387
03:48:48,460 --> 03:48:48,920
Upvote.

5388
03:48:49,080 --> 03:48:50,660
I upvote with my own message.

5389
03:48:52,800 --> 03:48:55,340
Which one is telling the truth.

5390
03:48:55,800 --> 03:48:57,500
Spreading misinformation.

5391
03:49:01,260 --> 03:49:02,020
All right.

5392
03:49:02,220 --> 03:49:02,400
Nice.

5393
03:49:02,860 --> 03:49:03,240
Okay.

5394
03:49:03,620 --> 03:49:04,560
Was that... That...

5395
03:49:04,560 --> 03:49:07,040
There's literally just going down the...

5396
03:49:07,040 --> 03:49:09,120
Jump into... Back into the pit of doom.

5397
03:49:10,540 --> 03:49:11,800
Like, there he is.

5398
03:49:11,960 --> 03:49:13,200
I see him right there.

5399
03:49:14,500 --> 03:49:16,120
Is there anything else right here?

5400
03:49:16,340 --> 03:49:16,680
All right.

5401
03:49:19,380 --> 03:49:21,680
Koala, thank you for the super chat.

5402
03:49:22,480 --> 03:49:24,520
I love doing these messages.

5403
03:49:25,480 --> 03:49:27,580
Scarlet, thank you for the super chat.

5404
03:49:27,760 --> 03:49:28,040
Thank you.

5405
03:49:29,400 --> 03:49:30,380
Not gonna lie.

5406
03:49:30,440 --> 03:49:31,980
These messages are really fun.

5407
03:49:36,640 --> 03:49:37,760
Community noted.

5408
03:49:38,080 --> 03:49:39,940
Who's gonna community note me?

5409
03:49:40,700 --> 03:49:43,380
In fact, you guys should like, appraisal it.

5410
03:49:44,700 --> 03:49:46,320
Wait, can you go through this door?

5411
03:49:48,140 --> 03:49:48,560
There's no way.

5412
03:49:48,680 --> 03:49:49,200
He's so thick.

5413
03:49:52,460 --> 03:49:53,740
There's no way he can.

5414
03:49:57,340 --> 03:49:57,940
All right.

5415
03:49:58,440 --> 03:50:01,180
I already community noted you.

5416
03:50:03,700 --> 03:50:04,380
That's right.

5417
03:50:04,560 --> 03:50:05,080
Too thick.

5418
03:50:05,780 --> 03:50:06,440
That's right.

5419
03:50:06,600 --> 03:50:07,840
You can't do nothing.

5420
03:50:08,720 --> 03:50:09,480
That's right.

5421
03:50:09,880 --> 03:50:10,800
You're too thick.

5422
03:50:11,000 --> 03:50:11,780
Just like those pots.

5423
03:50:12,340 --> 03:50:12,900
Oh my god.

5424
03:50:12,960 --> 03:50:14,140
He has so much range though.

5425
03:50:14,580 --> 03:50:15,440
Jesus Christ.

5426
03:50:16,040 --> 03:50:17,620
Don't get that range on this guy.

5427
03:50:17,720 --> 03:50:18,360
That's cheating.

5428
03:50:19,020 --> 03:50:21,380
Me using the door isn't cheating, guys.

5429
03:50:21,700 --> 03:50:24,340
Like, what the fuck is wrong with you?

5430
03:50:25,420 --> 03:50:26,840
What the fuck?

5431
03:50:27,100 --> 03:50:28,160
I can't even...

5432
03:50:31,350 --> 03:50:32,150
Okay.

5433
03:50:32,770 --> 03:50:34,290
I know what to do.

5434
03:50:43,400 --> 03:50:45,380
Okay, I don't want to waste all of my arrows.

5435
03:50:49,120 --> 03:50:51,600
Guys, I'm not wasting all of my arrows.

5436
03:50:51,840 --> 03:50:54,980
But like, I'm still trying to figure out how to like...

5437
03:50:55,520 --> 03:50:56,620
deal with this guy.

5438
03:50:59,340 --> 03:51:00,480
Oh my god.

5439
03:51:00,700 --> 03:51:01,520
What's wrong?

5440
03:51:01,700 --> 03:51:02,820
Why are you so mad?

5441
03:51:04,540 --> 03:51:05,720
Why are you mad?

5442
03:51:06,020 --> 03:51:06,740
I don't understand.

5443
03:51:07,820 --> 03:51:08,680
Oh my god.

5444
03:51:08,840 --> 03:51:08,980
Okay.

5445
03:51:10,220 --> 03:51:11,540
Why are you so mad?

5446
03:51:12,060 --> 03:51:12,620
He's trying.

5447
03:51:13,760 --> 03:51:14,620
I'll piss you off.

5448
03:51:18,250 --> 03:51:19,710
Yeah, I'm trying to.

5449
03:51:19,890 --> 03:51:20,350
But he's...

5450
03:51:20,350 --> 03:51:21,810
He's just so...

5451
03:51:21,810 --> 03:51:23,610
He's just standing there.

5452
03:51:24,770 --> 03:51:26,170
Wait, there's something above.

5453
03:51:26,550 --> 03:51:26,670
Dude.

5454
03:51:26,830 --> 03:51:27,910
Who the fuck is above?

5455
03:51:27,910 --> 03:51:30,630
What is this?

5456
03:51:31,370 --> 03:51:31,510
Oh.

5457
03:51:32,330 --> 03:51:32,750
Oh.

5458
03:51:34,370 --> 03:51:35,530
Oh shit.

5459
03:51:35,710 --> 03:51:36,150
Don't watch.

5460
03:51:36,450 --> 03:51:37,210
Don't watch.

5461
03:51:39,130 --> 03:51:40,390
Don't watch.

5462
03:51:40,390 --> 03:51:40,430
Don't watch.

5463
03:51:41,090 --> 03:51:41,810
Don't watch.

5464
03:51:42,710 --> 03:51:43,850
Alright, it's time.

5465
03:51:44,170 --> 03:51:45,510
Wait, I can't crack?

5466
03:51:47,610 --> 03:51:48,830
Oh my god.

5467
03:51:50,450 --> 03:51:51,710
I didn't...

5468
03:51:51,710 --> 03:51:53,530
Where's the elevator?

5469
03:51:54,090 --> 03:51:55,810
Where's the elevator?

5470
03:51:55,810 --> 03:51:56,110
Later.

5471
03:51:57,050 --> 03:51:58,130
I'm letting you try.

5472
03:51:58,350 --> 03:51:59,170
Oh, thanks, guys.

5473
03:51:59,570 --> 03:52:00,030
Thank you.

5474
03:52:04,230 --> 03:52:06,450
Yeah, I'm gonna... I'm gonna do it.

5475
03:52:06,570 --> 03:52:07,530
I'm gonna do the yellow.

5476
03:52:07,730 --> 03:52:08,290
You're right.

5477
03:52:08,430 --> 03:52:08,710
You know what?

5478
03:52:08,870 --> 03:52:09,230
Fuck it.

5479
03:52:09,330 --> 03:52:09,890
Let's do it.

5480
03:52:11,070 --> 03:52:11,370
Yeah.

5481
03:52:14,450 --> 03:52:15,630
I learned my lesson.

5482
03:52:21,650 --> 03:52:22,890
I learned my lesson.

5483
03:52:32,230 --> 03:52:32,630
Phew!

5484
03:52:33,510 --> 03:52:34,210
There we go.

5485
03:52:35,170 --> 03:52:35,350
Alright.

5486
03:52:35,710 --> 03:52:36,010
Yeah, no.

5487
03:52:36,130 --> 03:52:36,590
Fuck that guy.

5488
03:52:36,950 --> 03:52:39,010
No, after I saw the range, fuck that guy.

5489
03:52:44,360 --> 03:52:44,740
Okay.

5490
03:52:47,180 --> 03:52:48,700
He made me closer to the door.

5491
03:52:50,420 --> 03:52:51,220
God, closer!

5492
03:52:51,480 --> 03:52:52,780
Be in this one door!

5493
03:52:54,080 --> 03:52:57,600
Apparently he deserves cheese, apparently, from what you guys tell me.

5494
03:53:01,250 --> 03:53:01,650
Okay.

5495
03:53:03,810 --> 03:53:04,570
Okay, come on.

5496
03:53:04,690 --> 03:53:05,210
Get over here.

5497
03:53:05,730 --> 03:53:06,850
Get over here.

5498
03:53:07,490 --> 03:53:08,290
Come on.

5499
03:53:09,670 --> 03:53:10,850
Come on, come on.

5500
03:53:11,570 --> 03:53:13,170
Come on, get over here.

5501
03:53:13,790 --> 03:53:14,610
Come on!

5502
03:53:16,230 --> 03:53:17,050
Come on!

5503
03:53:17,750 --> 03:53:18,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5504
03:53:18,850 --> 03:53:19,290
Come on!

5505
03:53:19,530 --> 03:53:20,790
You know you want to...

5506
03:53:20,790 --> 03:53:22,970
I think he knows I wanna cheese him.

5507
03:53:23,650 --> 03:53:25,430
Oh my god, I think he knows.

5508
03:53:25,590 --> 03:53:27,250
Oh my god, I think he knows.

5509
03:53:27,490 --> 03:53:28,270
Jesus Christ.

5510
03:53:28,510 --> 03:53:30,070
This range is actually crazy.

5511
03:53:30,250 --> 03:53:30,990
Like, what the fuck?

5512
03:53:31,210 --> 03:53:32,830
What the fuck?!

5513
03:53:38,490 --> 03:53:39,950
Are you serious?!

5514
03:53:39,950 --> 03:53:41,610
I can't even get close to him!

5515
03:53:45,770 --> 03:53:47,050
He's actually...

5516
03:53:51,440 --> 03:53:53,480
What the fuck?!

5517
03:53:58,020 --> 03:53:59,020
Oh my god.

5518
03:53:59,560 --> 03:54:00,720
Oh my god.

5519
03:54:00,820 --> 03:54:01,860
He's actually bullshit.

5520
03:54:01,860 --> 03:54:03,600
Behind us!

5521
03:54:03,600 --> 03:54:03,840
Behind us!

5522
03:54:07,280 --> 03:54:08,540
Oh my god!

5523
03:54:08,600 --> 03:54:10,860
Look where he's trying to hit me!

5524
03:54:15,100 --> 03:54:15,980
I...

5525
03:54:17,600 --> 03:54:18,480
Okay.

5526
03:54:18,980 --> 03:54:19,860
He's just...

5527
03:54:19,860 --> 03:54:20,700
Moving along.

5528
03:54:23,540 --> 03:54:24,420
Alright.

5529
03:54:25,580 --> 03:54:26,300
What?

5530
03:54:28,440 --> 03:54:30,200
I'm the one step!

5531
03:54:30,700 --> 03:54:31,820
I'm the...

5532
03:54:31,820 --> 03:54:33,720
When I'm throwing knives, you're so right.

5533
03:54:34,060 --> 03:54:35,860
Give me a sec, let me...

5534
03:54:37,460 --> 03:54:39,080
Let me put that in.

5535
03:54:42,280 --> 03:54:43,400
Let me just...

5536
03:54:43,400 --> 03:54:45,520
Let me just do that.

5537
03:54:46,280 --> 03:54:47,360
Oh, shit.

5538
03:54:47,560 --> 03:54:47,860
Whoops.

5539
03:54:48,240 --> 03:54:48,540
Okay.

5540
03:54:53,130 --> 03:54:54,670
Does two damage.

5541
03:54:55,270 --> 03:54:55,990
Okay.

5542
03:54:57,790 --> 03:54:59,170
Okay, wait, I can...

5543
03:54:59,170 --> 03:55:00,670
Can I still not craft?

5544
03:55:01,610 --> 03:55:03,570
He's not even looking at me!

5545
03:55:06,470 --> 03:55:08,050
You're right, I'll put in a shortcut.

5546
03:55:11,780 --> 03:55:13,180
Okay, we're gonna get rid of...

5547
03:55:13,180 --> 03:55:14,100
We're gonna...

5548
03:55:14,100 --> 03:55:15,300
Switch this real quick.

5549
03:55:21,120 --> 03:55:21,640
Alright.

5550
03:55:25,160 --> 03:55:27,060
Okay, I need him to do this.

5551
03:55:27,720 --> 03:55:29,140
We have to cheese him.

5552
03:55:29,140 --> 03:55:31,160
He's like, blocking my only way.

5553
03:55:31,380 --> 03:55:32,520
And he's... he's a pain.

5554
03:55:32,700 --> 03:55:34,680
Right now, he's actually an asshole.

5555
03:55:37,860 --> 03:55:38,420
I...

5556
03:55:42,200 --> 03:55:43,700
I'm so dumb.

5557
03:55:44,320 --> 03:55:45,540
I can't...

5558
03:55:45,540 --> 03:55:46,140
I...

5559
03:55:49,940 --> 03:55:51,280
I just... I don't know.

5560
03:55:51,420 --> 03:55:53,120
I just think he'd block it, you know?

5561
03:55:53,840 --> 03:55:54,720
I don't know why.

5562
03:55:54,860 --> 03:55:56,700
I thought he wasn't gonna block it.

5563
03:55:58,260 --> 03:55:59,020
Here we go.

5564
03:55:59,820 --> 03:56:00,680
I don't know.

5565
03:56:00,840 --> 03:56:03,080
I thought he was just gonna let me do my thing.

5566
03:56:10,260 --> 03:56:10,960
Here we go.

5567
03:56:11,360 --> 03:56:11,680
One more.

5568
03:56:13,960 --> 03:56:14,400
I...

5569
03:56:16,960 --> 03:56:18,240
One last hit.

5570
03:56:19,360 --> 03:56:21,080
Oh, my God!

5571
03:56:21,100 --> 03:56:22,220
He doesn't care!

5572
03:56:39,520 --> 03:56:41,520
He just...

5573
03:56:41,520 --> 03:56:42,720
He so...

5574
03:56:42,720 --> 03:56:44,420
He's so loud...

5575
03:56:47,440 --> 03:56:49,420
Oh my god.

5576
03:56:50,420 --> 03:56:54,240
How is he allowed to just do that?

5577
03:56:54,600 --> 03:56:59,580
That was bullshit.

5578
03:57:00,160 --> 03:57:08,480
He fucking... He actually just moved to the right.

5579
03:57:09,420 --> 03:57:11,100
Oh my god.

5580
03:57:12,360 --> 03:57:13,960
That's so bullshit.

5581
03:57:14,740 --> 03:57:21,380
I can't believe he just, like, walked, like, to the right and then, like, fucked me up.

5582
03:57:25,520 --> 03:57:26,000
Alright.

5583
03:57:26,920 --> 03:57:28,960
Yeah, I'm moving to the right.

5584
03:57:29,120 --> 03:57:30,480
I can't believe it.

5585
03:57:30,840 --> 03:57:32,040
Wait, I can craft arrows now.

5586
03:57:32,120 --> 03:57:34,140
Let me craft that in the middle of the area.

5587
03:57:35,440 --> 03:57:35,920
Alright.

5588
03:57:36,660 --> 03:57:37,480
Is it this one?

5589
03:57:37,920 --> 03:57:38,540
Bone dart?

5590
03:57:38,800 --> 03:57:39,980
I can only craft bone dart.

5591
03:57:40,480 --> 03:57:41,780
Wait, I don't even have arrows.

5592
03:57:42,760 --> 03:57:46,760
The giant tree spirit gives golden sea and rewards you for taking down strong opponents.

5593
03:57:47,120 --> 03:57:48,640
Zyko, thank you for the super chat.

5594
03:57:48,780 --> 03:57:49,040
Thank you.

5595
03:57:49,140 --> 03:57:49,620
Thank you.

5596
03:57:50,360 --> 03:57:52,360
Uh, Zyko, thank you for the super chat.

5597
03:57:52,460 --> 03:57:52,700
Thank you.

5598
03:57:52,780 --> 03:57:53,260
Thank you.

5599
03:57:53,460 --> 03:57:54,620
I don't have the cookbook for arrows.

5600
03:57:54,840 --> 03:57:55,880
I just have darts.

5601
03:57:56,840 --> 03:57:58,200
I'll just make darts for now.

5602
03:57:59,420 --> 03:58:00,040
Fuck it.

5603
03:58:01,280 --> 03:58:02,100
Where's the grace?

5604
03:58:11,470 --> 03:58:12,810
Oh, there's a dog here.

5605
03:58:13,030 --> 03:58:14,290
How bad can a dog be?

5606
03:58:18,010 --> 03:58:19,270
Oh, there's two dogs.

5607
03:58:26,230 --> 03:58:26,670
Oh.

5608
03:58:26,670 --> 03:58:27,690
Really bad?

5609
03:58:28,170 --> 03:58:28,610
Okay.

5610
03:58:29,610 --> 03:58:31,730
I hate to have to go this way.

5611
03:58:32,230 --> 03:58:32,630
I guess.

5612
03:58:37,490 --> 03:58:38,870
Oh, that's good to know.

5613
03:58:50,210 --> 03:58:51,250
Oh, there's a grace.

5614
03:58:53,250 --> 03:58:54,210
There it is.

5615
03:58:56,790 --> 03:58:57,310
Oh.

5616
03:58:57,450 --> 03:58:57,910
Oh my god.

5617
03:58:57,910 --> 03:58:58,570
That scared me.

5618
03:58:58,730 --> 03:58:59,450
For some reason.

5619
03:59:00,630 --> 03:59:01,450
Oh, thank god.

5620
03:59:02,130 --> 03:59:02,970
Grace consumed.

5621
03:59:05,110 --> 03:59:06,090
Oh my god.

5622
03:59:06,290 --> 03:59:06,790
Thank god.

5623
03:59:06,790 --> 03:59:08,190
I don't know where I am.

5624
03:59:08,350 --> 03:59:10,210
I don't know where I am.

5625
03:59:12,910 --> 03:59:14,450
Alright, I can level up.

5626
03:59:14,610 --> 03:59:16,010
I guess more dexterity.

5627
03:59:17,630 --> 03:59:19,250
I feel so safe.

5628
03:59:22,670 --> 03:59:23,270
Safety.

5629
03:59:24,670 --> 03:59:25,670
Oh, where do I go?

5630
03:59:25,790 --> 03:59:27,110
I'm so fucking lost.

5631
03:59:30,870 --> 03:59:32,230
Where am I?

5632
03:59:36,450 --> 03:59:40,910
I'm exploring this dungeon in reverse right now.

5633
03:59:41,290 --> 03:59:44,370
Oh yeah, because I skipped everything here.

5634
03:59:50,940 --> 03:59:53,900
I'm like, I don't know where I am anymore.

5635
03:59:54,180 --> 03:59:55,780
I'm so confused.

5636
03:59:57,620 --> 03:59:58,460
Oh, there's a bird.

5637
03:59:58,980 --> 04:00:00,140
Is it a nice bird?

5638
04:00:02,540 --> 04:00:03,260
Hello.

5639
04:00:03,900 --> 04:00:05,340
Wait, is that a barrel?

5640
04:00:08,260 --> 04:00:10,620
Oh yeah, this is where I ran through everything.

5641
04:00:10,620 --> 04:00:12,160
I remember this area.

5642
04:00:13,660 --> 04:00:15,300
I ran through all of that.

5643
04:00:20,050 --> 04:00:21,970
I don't think it's a nice bird.

5644
04:00:27,180 --> 04:00:29,900
That seems like a barrel that goes kaboom.

5645
04:00:34,900 --> 04:00:35,760
You know what?

5646
04:00:35,880 --> 04:00:36,920
Let's try the boss fight.

5647
04:00:37,100 --> 04:00:37,720
I believe.

5648
04:00:39,600 --> 04:00:40,340
All right.

5649
04:00:41,440 --> 04:00:42,460
Wait, not here.

5650
04:00:46,530 --> 04:00:47,230
All right.

5651
04:00:47,970 --> 04:00:49,470
I don't have any arrows.

5652
04:00:49,750 --> 04:00:50,250
Was it here?

5653
04:00:56,850 --> 04:00:57,370
Wait.

5654
04:00:57,530 --> 04:00:58,610
Oh, I should upgrade my weapon.

5655
04:00:58,770 --> 04:00:59,110
You're right.

5656
04:00:59,510 --> 04:01:00,050
Let me teleport.

5657
04:01:00,450 --> 04:01:01,830
I forgot about my weapons.

5658
04:01:08,020 --> 04:01:08,540
Okay.

5659
04:01:08,940 --> 04:01:10,300
He's like, right.

5660
04:01:12,000 --> 04:01:13,180
He's like, right here.

5661
04:01:16,670 --> 04:01:17,190
Hello.

5662
04:01:17,990 --> 04:01:19,170
I need weapons.

5663
04:01:19,530 --> 04:01:22,270
Well, where have you been hiding?

5664
04:01:23,110 --> 04:01:24,410
I took you for dead.

5665
04:01:25,490 --> 04:01:25,850
No matter.

5666
04:01:26,090 --> 04:01:26,770
It's all the same.

5667
04:01:27,570 --> 04:01:28,910
Lay out your arms then.

5668
04:01:29,970 --> 04:01:30,610
All right.

5669
04:01:31,030 --> 04:01:31,530
Strength then.

5670
04:01:32,930 --> 04:01:34,270
How much money do I have?

5671
04:01:34,470 --> 04:01:35,490
Wait, do I not have money?

5672
04:01:37,290 --> 04:01:37,910
Oh, no.

5673
04:01:38,010 --> 04:01:38,370
I don't.

5674
04:01:38,490 --> 04:01:39,390
Oh, it's because I upgraded.

5675
04:01:39,690 --> 04:01:39,970
Don't worry.

5676
04:01:40,050 --> 04:01:40,850
I still have some...

5677
04:01:41,750 --> 04:01:42,190
Orbs.

5678
04:01:43,030 --> 04:01:44,530
Oh, that's my golden seed.

5679
04:01:48,570 --> 04:01:49,670
Where was it?

5680
04:01:50,390 --> 04:01:52,150
No, I picked up one.

5681
04:01:55,710 --> 04:01:56,830
Oh, there it is.

5682
04:01:57,010 --> 04:01:57,970
That should be enough.

5683
04:01:59,830 --> 04:02:00,270
Boom.

5684
04:02:00,270 --> 04:02:00,590
Boom.

5685
04:02:03,360 --> 04:02:04,420
Back already.

5686
04:02:04,720 --> 04:02:05,040
All right.

5687
04:02:05,380 --> 04:02:05,940
No matter.

5688
04:02:07,060 --> 04:02:08,440
Lay out your arms.

5689
04:02:08,740 --> 04:02:10,060
I think I have enough, right?

5690
04:02:10,560 --> 04:02:11,420
Yeah, I do.

5691
04:02:12,200 --> 04:02:13,540
Wait, I don't have...

5692
04:02:13,540 --> 04:02:14,920
Wait, what do I need?

5693
04:02:19,030 --> 04:02:20,150
What am I missing?

5694
04:02:22,750 --> 04:02:25,590
Oh, I need one more smithing stone.

5695
04:02:26,290 --> 04:02:26,570
Ah.

5696
04:02:27,910 --> 04:02:29,810
I need more smithing stone.

5697
04:02:31,050 --> 04:02:31,650
Yeah.

5698
04:02:36,940 --> 04:02:38,940
Can you buy smithing stone or no?

5699
04:02:43,220 --> 04:02:44,600
Buy at the old hag?

5700
04:02:44,840 --> 04:02:46,140
Who the fuck is the old hag?

5701
04:02:51,650 --> 04:02:52,590
It's cheap?

5702
04:02:53,950 --> 04:02:55,150
Is it a church?

5703
04:02:57,230 --> 04:02:59,030
Oh, later in the game.

5704
04:02:59,350 --> 04:03:01,250
Oh, it's the hag that's old, Doki.

5705
04:03:01,490 --> 04:03:01,750
God.

5706
04:03:03,270 --> 04:03:03,790
All right.

5707
04:03:03,910 --> 04:03:04,790
Let's try this boss fight.

5708
04:03:05,410 --> 04:03:07,310
I'm getting a little tired, though.

5709
04:03:07,510 --> 04:03:11,930
So, we'll see how I feel after I try that boss fight.

5710
04:03:12,790 --> 04:03:13,670
We'll see.

5711
04:03:14,190 --> 04:03:15,450
Does the church might have one?

5712
04:03:18,050 --> 04:03:19,630
Oh, does the church have one?

5713
04:03:24,730 --> 04:03:26,450
Oh, the merchant here has one?

5714
04:03:26,610 --> 04:03:27,370
Okay, let me see.

5715
04:03:32,390 --> 04:03:33,950
Let's see if the merchant has one.

5716
04:03:34,690 --> 04:03:35,270
All right.

5717
04:03:35,470 --> 04:03:36,070
Talk to me.

5718
04:03:36,970 --> 04:03:37,490
Okay.

5719
04:03:37,610 --> 04:03:38,530
I don't think he has one.

5720
04:03:38,850 --> 04:03:40,850
I don't think he has one.

5721
04:03:41,970 --> 04:03:42,490
Okay.

5722
04:03:43,570 --> 04:03:45,270
What about the church merchant?

5723
04:03:47,070 --> 04:03:49,010
Does the church merchant have one or no?

5724
04:03:51,410 --> 04:03:52,650
What the fuck is kill?

5725
04:03:55,470 --> 04:03:57,930
Oh, I need an item for him to sell it?

5726
04:04:02,200 --> 04:04:03,220
What the fuck is...

5727
04:04:03,220 --> 04:04:03,940
Is that Santa?

5728
04:04:06,160 --> 04:04:07,660
Oh, I should get the recipe for arrows.

5729
04:04:07,820 --> 04:04:08,080
You're right.

5730
04:04:08,400 --> 04:04:08,860
I should.

5731
04:04:10,240 --> 04:04:11,200
It's like...

5732
04:04:11,200 --> 04:04:11,760
Here.

5733
04:04:12,700 --> 04:04:13,180
Okay.

5734
04:04:13,380 --> 04:04:13,940
That's Santa.

5735
04:04:20,340 --> 04:04:21,160
All right.

5736
04:04:21,640 --> 04:04:22,260
All right, Santa.

5737
04:04:26,530 --> 04:04:27,970
I need my stones.

5738
04:04:29,010 --> 04:04:29,990
Weren't you...

5739
04:04:29,990 --> 04:04:31,230
Well, you're back.

5740
04:04:31,490 --> 04:04:32,070
I'm back.

5741
04:04:32,550 --> 04:04:33,070
Care to buy something?

5742
04:04:33,070 --> 04:04:33,610
Yeah, I survived.

5743
04:04:36,370 --> 04:04:37,450
Okay, purchase.

5744
04:04:38,690 --> 04:04:39,910
Does he have a...

5745
04:04:39,910 --> 04:04:40,670
Okay, arrow.

5746
04:04:41,130 --> 04:04:41,550
Cookbook.

5747
04:04:42,230 --> 04:04:43,470
Which one is he?

5748
04:04:44,030 --> 04:04:45,650
No, he has throwing daggers.

5749
04:04:47,470 --> 04:04:49,050
Is this one or...

5750
04:04:49,050 --> 04:04:50,610
Cookbook one or cookbook two?

5751
04:04:54,670 --> 04:04:56,970
Wait, is it cookbook one or cookbook two?

5752
04:05:01,850 --> 04:05:02,870
That has arrows.

5753
04:05:03,010 --> 04:05:04,290
I don't want to waste my...

5754
04:05:04,290 --> 04:05:05,410
Oh, press R.

5755
04:05:05,530 --> 04:05:06,390
Oh, I can see it?

5756
04:05:07,130 --> 04:05:07,330
Oh!

5757
04:05:07,890 --> 04:05:08,590
Bone arrow.

5758
04:05:08,990 --> 04:05:09,790
Okay, it's this one.

5759
04:05:10,650 --> 04:05:11,230
All right, nice.

5760
04:05:11,650 --> 04:05:12,630
I didn't want to waste it.

5761
04:05:12,910 --> 04:05:13,130
Goodbye.

5762
04:05:14,110 --> 04:05:15,410
Nice to do business.

5763
04:05:15,770 --> 04:05:16,230
All right.

5764
04:05:16,530 --> 04:05:20,290
I guess we'll...

5765
04:05:20,310 --> 04:05:21,550
Go to the boss now.

5766
04:05:25,360 --> 04:05:26,280
Wait, not here.

5767
04:05:26,400 --> 04:05:27,180
I keep thinking of...

5768
04:05:27,180 --> 04:05:28,120
This is the fast travel.

5769
04:05:28,240 --> 04:05:29,400
When I can just press my map.

5770
04:05:30,400 --> 04:05:31,440
It's secluded sale.

5771
04:05:31,600 --> 04:05:31,780
All right.

5772
04:05:31,840 --> 04:05:33,280
Let's see how fucked up it's gonna be.

5773
04:05:34,440 --> 04:05:35,120
Let's see.

5774
04:05:36,920 --> 04:05:37,500
All right.

5775
04:05:37,620 --> 04:05:38,980
This could be my eighth death.

5776
04:05:39,180 --> 04:05:40,640
So we'll see from here.

5777
04:05:41,720 --> 04:05:43,520
This could be my...

5778
04:05:43,520 --> 04:05:44,720
Eighth death right here.

5779
04:05:50,340 --> 04:05:50,980
All right.

5780
04:05:50,980 --> 04:05:51,960
Here I'll go.

5781
04:05:59,990 --> 04:06:01,750
Mighty dragon.

5782
04:06:03,070 --> 04:06:06,070
Thirted true born heir.

5783
04:06:07,070 --> 04:06:10,230
Lemme thy strength, oh kindred.

5784
04:06:11,510 --> 04:06:12,670
Deliver me unto...

5785
04:06:12,670 --> 04:06:14,390
Can the influencer build survive this?

5786
04:06:14,650 --> 04:06:16,950
I did not create a lot of messages.

5787
04:06:16,950 --> 04:06:18,210
So let's see.

5788
04:06:22,930 --> 04:06:25,350
I forgot to equip the jelly.

5789
04:06:26,190 --> 04:06:26,970
Pause.

5790
04:06:27,970 --> 04:06:28,750
Pause.

5791
04:06:29,310 --> 04:06:29,950
Tree Sentinel.

5792
04:06:32,420 --> 04:06:33,650
Oh my god.

5793
04:06:34,210 --> 04:06:34,290
Oh.

5794
04:06:34,610 --> 04:06:35,590
Oh, I forgot.

5795
04:06:38,130 --> 04:06:38,910
Pause.

5796
04:06:39,230 --> 04:06:39,630
Pause.

5797
04:06:39,950 --> 04:06:40,150
Please.

5798
04:06:40,930 --> 04:06:41,290
Parley.

5799
04:06:41,790 --> 04:06:42,130
Parley.

5800
04:06:42,130 --> 04:06:42,130
Hey!

5801
04:06:45,550 --> 04:06:46,470
Time out!

5802
04:06:47,890 --> 04:06:49,930
We each get one time out!

5803
04:06:59,100 --> 04:07:00,200
Oh my god, wait.

5804
04:07:01,360 --> 04:07:02,380
You gave me a time out.

5805
04:07:04,840 --> 04:07:06,040
Wait, it worked!

5806
04:07:06,320 --> 04:07:07,060
It worked!

5807
04:07:07,280 --> 04:07:08,020
Time out over!

5808
04:07:08,440 --> 04:07:09,100
It worked!

5809
04:07:12,260 --> 04:07:14,020
Guys, I got the time out!

5810
04:07:16,460 --> 04:07:18,000
Oh my god, please.

5811
04:07:20,460 --> 04:07:22,400
Oh my god, thanks for the time out.

5812
04:07:22,560 --> 04:07:23,580
Thanks for the time out.

5813
04:07:23,980 --> 04:07:25,400
Holy shit!

5814
04:07:26,020 --> 04:07:27,560
Holy fuck!

5815
04:07:30,000 --> 04:07:31,660
He's almost dead!

5816
04:07:32,220 --> 04:07:32,540
Oh

5817
04:07:36,980 --> 04:07:39,160
my god!

5818
04:07:39,740 --> 04:07:42,400
What the fuck?

5819
04:07:46,680 --> 04:07:47,960
Oh my god.

5820
04:07:51,120 --> 04:07:52,560
Jesus Christ!

5821
04:07:52,940 --> 04:07:55,120
Guys, how is he easier?

5822
04:07:55,340 --> 04:07:56,680
How is he easier?

5823
04:07:59,400 --> 04:08:01,320
Oh my god!

5824
04:08:02,040 --> 04:08:03,780
I was lied too!

5825
04:08:04,000 --> 04:08:06,000
It was absolutely not easier!

5826
04:08:06,540 --> 04:08:07,000
He won!

5827
04:08:09,800 --> 04:08:11,160
Oh my god!

5828
04:08:11,300 --> 04:08:13,060
I ran into the wind!

5829
04:08:17,520 --> 04:08:19,280
Jesus Christ!

5830
04:08:23,750 --> 04:08:24,650
Okay.

5831
04:08:32,190 --> 04:08:34,850
He actually is easy.

5832
04:08:36,310 --> 04:08:40,350
He's easier, but you skipped the entire level.

5833
04:08:42,550 --> 04:08:43,490
Okay, wait.

5834
04:08:43,730 --> 04:08:43,970
Okay.

5835
04:08:44,110 --> 04:08:45,230
I just need to figure out his pattern.

5836
04:08:46,050 --> 04:08:48,130
I need to figure out his pattern.

5837
04:08:48,450 --> 04:08:49,530
It'll be fine.

5838
04:08:51,850 --> 04:08:55,190
We just... We just need to figure out his pattern.

5839
04:08:56,130 --> 04:08:56,850
Okay.

5840
04:08:56,930 --> 04:08:56,950
Okay.

5841
04:09:00,530 --> 04:09:02,270
I'm trying to figure it out.

5842
04:09:05,370 --> 04:09:07,010
My poor jellyfish.

5843
04:09:08,310 --> 04:09:10,330
My poor jellyfish.

5844
04:09:13,370 --> 04:09:14,710
Oh my god!

5845
04:09:14,870 --> 04:09:15,730
I can't run!

5846
04:09:23,480 --> 04:09:24,660
Oh my god.

5847
04:09:24,960 --> 04:09:26,460
My poor jellyfish.

5848
04:09:26,700 --> 04:09:27,880
My poor guy.

5849
04:09:27,880 --> 04:09:29,920
Oh my god.

5850
04:09:30,180 --> 04:09:31,900
Oh my god!

5851
04:09:32,060 --> 04:09:34,740
Are you... How does...

5852
04:09:39,090 --> 04:09:39,870
How does...

5853
04:09:43,320 --> 04:09:45,300
How does he predict that...

5854
04:09:52,140 --> 04:09:57,160
Oh my god.

5855
04:09:59,220 --> 04:10:02,460
He punishes right-handed people.

5856
04:10:02,460 --> 04:10:04,540
Am I underleveled?

5857
04:10:04,820 --> 04:10:05,980
Am I underleveled?

5858
04:10:05,980 --> 04:10:06,980
Am I...

5859
04:10:06,980 --> 04:10:07,740
Guys.

5860
04:10:08,180 --> 04:10:09,140
Keep it to me straight.

5861
04:10:09,560 --> 04:10:11,160
Am I underleveled right now?

5862
04:10:11,440 --> 04:10:12,240
Am I...

5863
04:10:12,240 --> 04:10:12,940
Am I...

5864
04:10:12,940 --> 04:10:13,780
Probably.

5865
04:10:14,740 --> 04:10:15,760
I need to know.

5866
04:10:16,420 --> 04:10:17,140
Am I...

5867
04:10:17,140 --> 04:10:18,360
Am I underleveled?

5868
04:10:20,040 --> 04:10:21,080
Oh, I'm not.

5869
04:10:21,220 --> 04:10:21,440
Okay.

5870
04:10:24,160 --> 04:10:25,220
Okay, I'm not.

5871
04:10:28,440 --> 04:10:29,900
A little maybe.

5872
04:10:30,340 --> 04:10:30,920
Just a little.

5873
04:10:31,120 --> 04:10:31,240
Okay.

5874
04:10:31,400 --> 04:10:32,080
It's just a little.

5875
04:10:32,520 --> 04:10:32,980
That's fine.

5876
04:10:38,670 --> 04:10:39,250
Jeez.

5877
04:10:41,790 --> 04:10:42,950
Oh my god.

5878
04:10:43,170 --> 04:10:44,190
They're lying, dude.

5879
04:10:45,990 --> 04:10:47,450
You are indeed.

5880
04:10:48,230 --> 04:10:48,470
Okay.

5881
04:10:48,650 --> 04:10:51,330
After this, maybe I'll level up a little bit.

5882
04:10:57,090 --> 04:10:57,670
Of course.

5883
04:10:58,290 --> 04:10:58,690
Okay.

5884
04:10:59,510 --> 04:11:02,170
I know my summons is a little underleveled though.

5885
04:11:02,470 --> 04:11:02,890
Oh my god.

5886
04:11:03,070 --> 04:11:03,790
My jellyfish.

5887
04:11:08,580 --> 04:11:09,180
Okay.

5888
04:11:12,500 --> 04:11:13,640
Oh my god.

5889
04:11:14,760 --> 04:11:15,920
Oh wait, I should have achieved that.

5890
04:11:16,220 --> 04:11:16,420
No!

5891
04:11:19,400 --> 04:11:20,880
Might have been a mistake.

5892
04:11:23,400 --> 04:11:25,820
Might have been a mistake right there.

5893
04:11:32,840 --> 04:11:33,440
Okay.

5894
04:11:34,080 --> 04:11:34,480
Alright.

5895
04:11:40,850 --> 04:11:41,330
Okay.

5896
04:11:44,050 --> 04:11:45,310
Oh, I don't trust that.

5897
04:11:45,550 --> 04:11:46,610
Oh, what the fuck?

5898
04:11:52,220 --> 04:11:54,040
What the fuck is going on?

5899
04:11:54,200 --> 04:11:55,040
What is he doing?

5900
04:11:55,280 --> 04:11:56,620
Why did he cut his arm off?

5901
04:12:15,320 --> 04:12:17,020
Why did he cut his arms off?

5902
04:12:25,560 --> 04:12:26,660
What the fuck?

5903
04:12:28,700 --> 04:12:29,880
He can just...

5904
04:12:29,880 --> 04:12:30,240
He can just...

5905
04:12:30,240 --> 04:12:31,080
Do that?

5906
04:12:34,670 --> 04:12:36,270
Oh my god, he's alive!

5907
04:12:44,190 --> 04:12:45,350
Oh shit.

5908
04:12:45,930 --> 04:12:46,350
Oh shit.

5909
04:12:46,710 --> 04:12:47,650
Goodbye, my buddy.

5910
04:12:48,350 --> 04:12:49,490
Goodbye, my buddy.

5911
04:12:49,970 --> 04:12:50,370
Goodbye.

5912
04:12:53,350 --> 04:12:56,770
Guys, I think my jellyfish might be dead.

5913
04:12:59,810 --> 04:13:01,410
Oh my god.

5914
04:13:05,150 --> 04:13:06,770
Oh my god.

5915
04:13:06,930 --> 04:13:07,690
He crashed me!

5916
04:13:07,930 --> 04:13:08,170
No!

5917
04:13:08,990 --> 04:13:09,650
Let me go!

5918
04:13:09,870 --> 04:13:09,970
No!

5919
04:13:09,970 --> 04:13:10,230
Oh my god!

5920
04:13:11,830 --> 04:13:12,970
Oh my god, freeze!

5921
04:13:13,330 --> 04:13:14,030
Appraise me!

5922
04:13:15,090 --> 04:13:15,950
Thank you!

5923
04:13:17,570 --> 04:13:19,190
Thank you for the appraise!

5924
04:13:19,370 --> 04:13:20,530
Thank you, thank you!

5925
04:13:22,550 --> 04:13:23,690
Oh shit!

5926
04:13:24,330 --> 04:13:25,010
Good appraise!

5927
04:13:25,170 --> 04:13:26,030
Good appraise!

5928
04:13:26,210 --> 04:13:27,090
Good appraise!

5929
04:13:27,090 --> 04:13:29,730
Oh my god!

5930
04:13:29,730 --> 04:13:30,470
Oh!

5931
04:13:34,450 --> 04:13:36,230
Oh my god!

5932
04:13:41,130 --> 04:13:42,410
Oh my god!

5933
04:13:42,510 --> 04:14:00,070
Oh my god!

5934
04:14:00,070 --> 04:14:03,030
That would have been so clutch.

5935
04:14:03,710 --> 04:14:05,290
Oh, that was crazy.

5936
04:14:06,290 --> 04:14:07,870
Okay, we gotta farm a little bit.

5937
04:14:08,070 --> 04:14:09,630
We have to farm a little bit.

5938
04:14:09,750 --> 04:14:11,330
That was not good for us.

5939
04:14:12,690 --> 04:14:15,090
Almost carried by a phrase.

5940
04:14:15,670 --> 04:14:16,830
Oh, my God.

5941
04:14:19,630 --> 04:14:20,930
I just gotta get through.

5942
04:14:20,970 --> 04:14:23,670
I'm just gonna level up one to two more times.

5943
04:14:24,250 --> 04:14:26,470
My build is so OP.

5944
04:14:30,150 --> 04:14:31,030
Oh, shit.

5945
04:14:32,590 --> 04:14:33,370
Oh, shit.

5946
04:14:33,490 --> 04:14:34,050
I gotta run.

5947
04:14:35,790 --> 04:14:37,730
Gotta get the little guy out of the way.

5948
04:14:38,510 --> 04:14:39,250
Oh, shit.

5949
04:14:39,330 --> 04:14:39,510
Nice.

5950
04:14:40,090 --> 04:14:40,650
And it's free.

5951
04:14:43,410 --> 04:14:43,850
Okay.

5952
04:14:44,330 --> 04:14:45,550
Okay, we can kill him now.

5953
04:14:49,870 --> 04:14:50,310
Okay.

5954
04:14:52,350 --> 04:14:53,290
Oh, my God.

5955
04:14:53,570 --> 04:14:54,290
That's not bad.

5956
04:14:54,610 --> 04:14:55,570
Oh, Jesus Christ.

5957
04:14:55,970 --> 04:14:59,830
I need to actually... I need to get out of here.

5958
04:15:01,350 --> 04:15:02,230
Oh, my God.

5959
04:15:03,950 --> 04:15:04,370
Okay.

5960
04:15:05,430 --> 04:15:07,270
Stupid dragon arm though.

5961
04:15:08,250 --> 04:15:09,610
Dragon arm is fucking crazy.

5962
04:15:09,850 --> 04:15:10,510
I'm not gonna lie.

5963
04:15:13,970 --> 04:15:14,630
Okay, yep.

5964
04:15:17,660 --> 04:15:18,140
Jeez!

5965
04:15:18,560 --> 04:15:18,780
Oh!

5966
04:15:22,990 --> 04:15:24,710
He slapped me!

5967
04:15:28,370 --> 04:15:29,830
Holy fuck!

5968
04:15:29,830 --> 04:15:33,490
Okay, I did not expect him to slam me like that.

5969
04:15:33,690 --> 04:15:35,230
Okay, that was awkward.

5970
04:15:35,930 --> 04:15:45,850
Oops... I did not expect to squash... Alright, this time... I did not dodge.

5971
04:15:46,690 --> 04:15:50,890
No, I admit... I might have fucked up, because I didn't dodge.

5972
04:15:53,130 --> 04:15:54,070
Okay, nice.

5973
04:15:54,630 --> 04:15:55,230
Nice.

5974
04:15:55,470 --> 04:15:56,110
Kill those guys.

5975
04:15:56,430 --> 04:15:56,710
Nice.

5976
04:15:57,390 --> 04:15:58,030
Do that again.

5977
04:15:59,750 --> 04:16:00,670
Ooh, that again.

5978
04:16:02,530 --> 04:16:03,370
Ooh, nice.

5979
04:16:03,570 --> 04:16:04,010
There you go.

5980
04:16:10,520 --> 04:16:10,900
Okay.

5981
04:16:13,280 --> 04:16:14,860
Oh my god, get me out of here!

5982
04:16:15,020 --> 04:16:15,700
Get me out of here!

5983
04:16:15,800 --> 04:16:16,660
Get me out of here!

5984
04:16:18,980 --> 04:16:19,780
Okay, nice.

5985
04:16:22,540 --> 04:16:22,960
Bye.

5986
04:16:24,040 --> 04:16:25,740
Believe in the power of poison.

5987
04:16:26,740 --> 04:16:27,160
Jesus.

5988
04:16:27,400 --> 04:16:27,620
Okay.

5989
04:16:30,480 --> 04:16:31,520
This should be good now.

5990
04:16:31,620 --> 04:16:31,920
Alright.

5991
04:16:31,920 --> 04:16:32,380
Alright, nice.

5992
04:16:33,100 --> 04:16:35,240
Whoa, that was scary.

5993
04:16:37,680 --> 04:16:38,940
Alright, let's explore.

5994
04:16:39,220 --> 04:16:42,020
Okay, we're gonna heal here, and then we'll go back to exploring.

5995
04:16:42,680 --> 04:16:47,260
We'll go back to going through this dungeon.

5996
04:16:47,960 --> 04:16:49,620
Ah, I keep fucking it up.

5997
04:16:49,780 --> 04:16:51,180
Okay, it's here.

5998
04:16:51,800 --> 04:16:53,200
The rampart tower.

5999
04:16:56,480 --> 04:16:58,520
Yeah, maybe we'll find some smithing stones.

6000
04:16:59,460 --> 04:17:00,260
I don't know.

6001
04:17:00,400 --> 04:17:01,360
I guess I'll go this way.

6002
04:17:05,360 --> 04:17:05,900
Why?

6003
04:17:05,960 --> 04:17:07,040
Have I, like, in here?

6004
04:17:07,180 --> 04:17:08,160
Okay, no, I have not.

6005
04:17:08,400 --> 04:17:09,640
I've skipped everything here.

6006
04:17:10,240 --> 04:17:12,160
This is the elevator I came from.

6007
04:17:15,890 --> 04:17:17,090
I pull this lever?

6008
04:17:19,270 --> 04:17:21,410
Wait, contraption does not move?

6009
04:17:21,590 --> 04:17:21,870
Why?

6010
04:17:26,170 --> 04:17:27,290
Why no move?

6011
04:17:27,550 --> 04:17:28,090
Shit.

6012
04:17:30,890 --> 04:17:31,230
Alright.

6013
04:17:32,450 --> 04:17:33,230
Got this.

6014
04:17:33,930 --> 04:17:34,990
Let's just walk through here.

6015
04:17:40,490 --> 04:17:41,090
Alright.

6016
04:17:41,090 --> 04:17:42,210
Let's go through here.

6017
04:17:45,450 --> 04:17:48,510
Yeah, try to... I was actually trying to jump.

6018
04:17:49,830 --> 04:17:50,310
No!

6019
04:17:54,640 --> 04:17:55,460
Hurry up.

6020
04:17:57,400 --> 04:17:58,920
Where the fuck is the arrow guy?

6021
04:17:59,760 --> 04:18:00,920
How do I get to you?

6022
04:18:05,380 --> 04:18:06,520
Come and roll, bitch.

6023
04:18:07,220 --> 04:18:07,360
Wait.

6024
04:18:11,770 --> 04:18:12,530
Never mind.

6025
04:18:15,530 --> 04:18:19,410
I guess... I guess I'm not coming over.

6026
04:18:22,330 --> 04:18:23,050
Okay.

6027
04:18:25,110 --> 04:18:26,590
Can I jump on that?

6028
04:18:27,090 --> 04:18:28,190
I wonder.

6029
04:18:30,030 --> 04:18:31,050
Jump on the wheel.

6030
04:18:31,190 --> 04:18:31,610
This wheel?

6031
04:18:32,170 --> 04:18:32,610
Let's see.

6032
04:18:33,470 --> 04:18:34,630
Let's see if I can.

6033
04:18:34,630 --> 04:18:34,630
Oh, my god.

6034
04:18:37,530 --> 04:18:38,130
Oh, my god.

6035
04:18:38,130 --> 04:18:39,890
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

6036
04:18:39,890 --> 04:18:40,950
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

6037
04:18:41,390 --> 04:18:42,210
That's right.

6038
04:18:43,790 --> 04:18:45,290
Turn French a little there.

6039
04:18:52,550 --> 04:18:53,990
Uh... Ho, ho, ho.

6040
04:18:54,710 --> 04:18:55,530
My core.

6041
04:19:00,330 --> 04:19:00,930
Alright.

6042
04:19:04,270 --> 04:19:05,330
Where am I?

6043
04:19:07,130 --> 04:19:08,430
This is the story.

6044
04:19:08,430 --> 04:19:10,470
Where I'll never know where I am.

6045
04:19:10,590 --> 04:19:12,230
Oh, there you are.

6046
04:19:14,710 --> 04:19:15,390
Dan.

6047
04:19:17,150 --> 04:19:18,210
Oh, not you.

6048
04:19:18,590 --> 04:19:19,070
No.

6049
04:19:20,890 --> 04:19:22,210
Oh, you're so far.

6050
04:19:22,430 --> 04:19:23,290
You're so far.

6051
04:19:25,930 --> 04:19:27,750
Oh, my god.

6052
04:19:28,130 --> 04:19:29,510
Oh, my god.

6053
04:19:32,660 --> 04:19:33,340
Okay.

6054
04:19:36,750 --> 04:19:37,430
What?

6055
04:19:44,600 --> 04:19:45,280
Okay.

6056
04:19:46,340 --> 04:19:46,940
Nice.

6057
04:19:47,000 --> 04:19:47,000
Nice.

6058
04:19:49,960 --> 04:19:50,800
I'm fine.

6059
04:19:51,520 --> 04:19:52,780
I might have missed.

6060
04:19:53,080 --> 04:19:53,740
Oh, shit!

6061
04:19:57,950 --> 04:19:58,930
Oh, my god.

6062
04:19:59,070 --> 04:19:59,970
I hate these win attacks.

6063
04:20:00,670 --> 04:20:02,330
These win attacks are so dumb.

6064
04:20:03,510 --> 04:20:05,490
These win attacks are so fucking dumb.

6065
04:20:06,150 --> 04:20:06,950
Jesus Christ.

6066
04:20:09,490 --> 04:20:10,290
That's fine.

6067
04:20:10,470 --> 04:20:11,250
Oh, I got smithing stone.

6068
04:20:11,390 --> 04:20:11,770
Yippee!

6069
04:20:13,490 --> 04:20:14,710
Got what I needed.

6070
04:20:19,350 --> 04:20:19,950
Okay.

6071
04:20:23,730 --> 04:20:25,370
I got golden.

6072
04:20:28,370 --> 04:20:29,550
Is that it?

6073
04:20:36,450 --> 04:20:37,410
Okay.

6074
04:20:37,490 --> 04:20:38,030
That's it, right?

6075
04:20:39,490 --> 04:20:40,730
Sniper ahead?

6076
04:20:41,470 --> 04:20:41,810
Where?

6077
04:20:43,250 --> 04:20:45,650
I gotta jump to the pillars?

6078
04:20:46,650 --> 04:20:47,970
What pillars?

6079
04:20:48,730 --> 04:20:50,030
Oh, these?

6080
04:20:52,970 --> 04:20:54,090
Now, where do I go?

6081
04:20:59,450 --> 04:20:59,850
Now, where do I go?

6082
04:20:59,850 --> 04:21:00,630
You want me to go?

6083
04:21:10,890 --> 04:21:11,890
That's that one?

6084
04:21:12,030 --> 04:21:13,030
That area right there?

6085
04:21:17,690 --> 04:21:19,110
There's an area right there.

6086
04:21:22,950 --> 04:21:23,490
Okay.

6087
04:21:26,230 --> 04:21:27,070
Oh, here.

6088
04:21:31,930 --> 04:21:33,350
Oh, my god.

6089
04:21:34,230 --> 04:21:35,670
Accidentally, I'm almost fucking that up.

6090
04:21:37,410 --> 04:21:38,550
Wait, I'm back here.

6091
04:21:41,190 --> 04:21:42,390
Shit went that way.

6092
04:21:44,070 --> 04:21:45,090
I'm back here.

6093
04:21:51,240 --> 04:21:52,220
Other tower.

6094
04:21:52,660 --> 04:21:54,100
Wait, where's the other tower?

6095
04:21:54,420 --> 04:21:55,060
This one?

6096
04:22:00,010 --> 04:22:00,470
Okay.

6097
04:22:00,890 --> 04:22:02,370
I know how to get there.

6098
04:22:03,710 --> 04:22:05,050
It's, like, here.

6099
04:22:05,990 --> 04:22:07,770
Do I fight the friendly birds?

6100
04:22:08,350 --> 04:22:09,250
Do they seem- You know what?

6101
04:22:09,250 --> 04:22:10,130
They seem friendly.

6102
04:22:10,290 --> 04:22:11,210
Let's just heal up, then.

6103
04:22:15,200 --> 04:22:15,640
Alright.

6104
04:22:16,400 --> 04:22:16,500
Alright.

6105
04:22:16,500 --> 04:22:16,500
Alright.

6106
04:22:16,500 --> 04:22:17,380
Wait, how much do I have?

6107
04:22:17,520 --> 04:22:18,260
Oh, I almost have Lola.

6108
04:22:18,840 --> 04:22:19,960
Alright, let's do it.

6109
04:22:20,800 --> 04:22:22,200
They seem so friendly.

6110
04:22:24,280 --> 04:22:24,720
Oh!

6111
04:22:27,380 --> 04:22:28,180
Oh, fuck!

6112
04:22:33,290 --> 04:22:33,730
Okay.

6113
04:22:34,150 --> 04:22:34,890
See, I told you.

6114
04:22:34,950 --> 04:22:35,890
They seem so friendly.

6115
04:22:36,430 --> 04:22:38,410
They seem so friendly.

6116
04:22:51,300 --> 04:22:56,200
Oh, my God, they twirl so much.

6117
04:22:57,280 --> 04:22:58,300
Okay, nice.

6118
04:22:59,640 --> 04:23:01,640
Jesus, they twirl so much.

6119
04:23:02,620 --> 04:23:04,180
I got confused.

6120
04:23:05,520 --> 04:23:07,840
How do they not get, like, damage?

6121
04:23:08,760 --> 04:23:11,040
Like, friendly fire by that.

6122
04:23:16,520 --> 04:23:18,380
That should be friendly fire.

6123
04:23:18,580 --> 04:23:19,940
First off, jumping.

6124
04:23:47,780 --> 04:23:48,880
How did he die?

6125
04:23:49,080 --> 04:23:49,780
Oh, okay.

6126
04:23:50,320 --> 04:23:51,640
Okay, that's how he died.

6127
04:23:51,880 --> 04:23:52,180
Okay.

6128
04:24:04,600 --> 04:24:06,100
I don't think he made it.

6129
04:24:06,320 --> 04:24:08,080
I don't think he...

6130
04:24:21,350 --> 04:24:23,910
Okay, I just want to be sure.

6131
04:24:24,170 --> 04:24:25,330
I just...

6132
04:24:25,330 --> 04:24:26,410
Okay, guys.

6133
04:24:26,670 --> 04:24:28,530
This might go horribly wrong.

6134
04:24:29,110 --> 04:24:29,570
I mean...

6135
04:24:33,030 --> 04:24:35,170
This could go horribly wrong.

6136
04:24:38,820 --> 04:24:40,640
Oh, I need that.

6137
04:24:42,000 --> 04:24:42,760
Okay.

6138
04:24:43,720 --> 04:24:44,260
Okay.

6139
04:24:46,000 --> 04:24:47,080
Seek home.

6140
04:24:48,780 --> 04:24:50,020
Seek down.

6141
04:24:51,240 --> 04:24:53,080
Wait, how did he fuck that up?

6142
04:24:53,140 --> 04:24:54,080
You just go forward.

6143
04:24:54,880 --> 04:24:56,060
How did that happen?

6144
04:24:56,760 --> 04:24:57,440
Try skill.

6145
04:24:57,840 --> 04:24:58,260
Oh, nice.

6146
04:25:00,060 --> 04:25:02,200
How did he fuck that up?

6147
04:25:02,660 --> 04:25:04,540
How did he just go...

6148
04:25:04,540 --> 04:25:05,800
He just go straight.

6149
04:25:09,740 --> 04:25:10,460
Okay.

6150
04:25:11,040 --> 04:25:12,300
I'm so paranoid.

6151
04:25:13,980 --> 04:25:14,880
Liar ahead.

6152
04:25:15,520 --> 04:25:15,980
Oh, shit.

6153
04:25:16,180 --> 04:25:16,660
Which one?

6154
04:25:16,860 --> 04:25:17,980
There's so many of us.

6155
04:25:18,700 --> 04:25:19,260
Down ahead.

6156
04:25:19,500 --> 04:25:20,620
Wait, is this the liar?

6157
04:25:21,680 --> 04:25:22,680
I don't know.

6158
04:25:22,820 --> 04:25:23,840
Who's lying?

6159
04:25:31,780 --> 04:25:32,300
Okay.

6160
04:25:35,300 --> 04:25:36,400
Who's the liar?

6161
04:25:38,580 --> 04:25:39,560
Vision of hope.

6162
04:25:39,940 --> 04:25:40,580
Vision of house.

6163
04:25:41,860 --> 04:25:43,020
Oh, this one?

6164
04:25:44,600 --> 04:25:46,040
Can't trust nobody.

6165
04:25:46,900 --> 04:25:48,060
Not even myself.

6166
04:25:48,820 --> 04:25:49,900
Vision of God.

6167
04:25:52,440 --> 04:25:53,120
Wait.

6168
04:26:07,140 --> 04:26:07,780
Wait.

6169
04:26:08,340 --> 04:26:08,520
No.

6170
04:26:11,520 --> 04:26:12,060
No.

6171
04:26:15,820 --> 04:26:16,080
Wait.

6172
04:26:16,260 --> 04:26:16,400
Okay.

6173
04:26:16,600 --> 04:26:16,700
Wait.

6174
04:26:16,820 --> 04:26:17,240
There's...

6175
04:26:17,240 --> 04:26:18,360
There's a rock here.

6176
04:26:20,620 --> 04:26:22,040
There's a rock here.

6177
04:26:25,920 --> 04:26:26,800
What now?

6178
04:26:27,940 --> 04:26:28,420
Okay.

6179
04:26:37,110 --> 04:26:37,590
Oh.

6180
04:26:37,910 --> 04:26:38,710
Oh my God.

6181
04:26:38,890 --> 04:26:39,490
Oh my God.

6182
04:26:39,630 --> 04:26:40,130
Oh my God.

6183
04:26:40,230 --> 04:26:40,810
There was hope.

6184
04:26:45,410 --> 04:26:48,930
I feel like I'm gonna accidentally like kill myself right here.

6185
04:26:49,170 --> 04:26:49,870
Oh my God.

6186
04:26:50,050 --> 04:26:50,830
Oh my God.

6187
04:26:50,950 --> 04:26:51,650
Oh my God.

6188
04:26:52,030 --> 04:26:52,930
Oh my God.

6189
04:26:53,030 --> 04:26:54,190
I just have to believe.

6190
04:26:54,370 --> 04:26:55,770
I have to believe.

6191
04:26:56,490 --> 04:26:57,410
Holy fuck.

6192
04:26:57,410 --> 04:26:58,250
Where am I?

6193
04:26:59,510 --> 04:27:01,590
Where the fuck am I?

6194
04:27:02,390 --> 04:27:04,170
Just gotta believe.

6195
04:27:09,830 --> 04:27:11,690
That guy's gonna push me off.

6196
04:27:12,810 --> 04:27:13,750
Oh no.

6197
04:27:14,050 --> 04:27:14,470
It's him.

6198
04:27:14,530 --> 04:27:15,490
What do you mean?

6199
04:27:15,890 --> 04:27:17,230
What do you mean?

6200
04:27:17,270 --> 04:27:17,950
Oh no.

6201
04:27:18,890 --> 04:27:19,890
Oh no.

6202
04:27:20,210 --> 04:27:21,670
I'm crafting arrows.

6203
04:27:21,970 --> 04:27:23,330
I don't have bones.

6204
04:27:23,490 --> 04:27:24,430
I forgot to farm.

6205
04:27:24,570 --> 04:27:27,050
I used all my bones for the stupid things.

6206
04:27:27,670 --> 04:27:28,110
I...

6207
04:27:31,430 --> 04:27:32,610
Run past him.

6208
04:27:32,750 --> 04:27:32,870
Okay.

6209
04:27:33,010 --> 04:27:33,930
I know what to do.

6210
04:27:36,790 --> 04:27:37,830
Never mind.

6211
04:27:39,570 --> 04:27:40,730
Never mind.

6212
04:27:45,210 --> 04:27:47,470
My horse doesn't wanna play today.

6213
04:27:52,500 --> 04:27:52,840
Wait.

6214
04:27:52,940 --> 04:27:53,640
Does he see me?

6215
04:27:57,940 --> 04:27:59,340
Follow my heart.

6216
04:28:04,370 --> 04:28:06,910
I feel so safe.

6217
04:28:07,090 --> 04:28:10,170
I feel so safe right now.

6218
04:28:13,130 --> 04:28:14,710
There he is.

6219
04:28:15,070 --> 04:28:15,890
Right there.

6220
04:28:16,670 --> 04:28:17,910
Just chillin'.

6221
04:28:20,030 --> 04:28:20,830
Yeah.

6222
04:28:21,010 --> 04:28:22,290
But how important is that?

6223
04:28:24,170 --> 04:28:24,990
Don't skip.

6224
04:28:25,210 --> 04:28:26,890
You gotta teach him a lesson.

6225
04:28:27,150 --> 04:28:29,250
I'll let future Doki handle that.

6226
04:28:29,750 --> 04:28:31,710
Future Doki can teach him a lesson.

6227
04:28:31,890 --> 04:28:34,490
Current Doki is trying to figure out where I am.

6228
04:28:36,170 --> 04:28:36,570
Wait.

6229
04:28:36,770 --> 04:28:37,050
I love you.

6230
04:28:37,230 --> 04:28:37,730
Shortcut.

6231
04:28:39,170 --> 04:28:39,990
Let it speak.

6232
04:28:40,150 --> 04:28:40,470
Behold.

6233
04:28:40,670 --> 04:28:41,010
Seems something.

6234
04:28:41,070 --> 04:28:41,190
Oh.

6235
04:28:41,290 --> 04:28:42,170
That's like where I started.

6236
04:28:45,470 --> 04:28:45,970
Yeah.

6237
04:28:46,090 --> 04:28:46,990
I assume that's the shortcut.

6238
04:28:51,570 --> 04:28:52,070
Okay.

6239
04:28:52,150 --> 04:28:52,490
Nice.

6240
04:28:53,210 --> 04:28:53,710
Up.

6241
04:28:55,870 --> 04:28:57,390
Try luring out.

6242
04:28:57,650 --> 04:28:58,310
Snake.

6243
04:28:59,250 --> 04:29:00,010
Snake?

6244
04:29:02,970 --> 04:29:03,950
Where's Snake?

6245
04:29:08,770 --> 04:29:09,770
Snake where?

6246
04:29:12,110 --> 04:29:13,230
I'm scared.

6247
04:29:14,290 --> 04:29:16,070
What does he mean by Snake?

6248
04:29:20,850 --> 04:29:21,610
Oh.

6249
04:29:21,730 --> 04:29:22,070
This area.

6250
04:29:22,230 --> 04:29:22,330
Oh.

6251
04:29:22,410 --> 04:29:23,150
I'm back here.

6252
04:29:26,370 --> 04:29:27,130
Yay.

6253
04:29:27,950 --> 04:29:28,170
Alright.

6254
04:29:28,410 --> 04:29:28,610
Now.

6255
04:29:29,790 --> 04:29:33,010
Now I save and then we kill that guy.

6256
04:29:33,870 --> 04:29:35,050
Does he give a lot of...

6257
04:29:35,970 --> 04:29:37,030
Does he give a lot?

6258
04:29:39,210 --> 04:29:39,650
Wait.

6259
04:29:39,730 --> 04:29:40,150
Do we have enough?

6260
04:29:40,590 --> 04:29:40,730
No.

6261
04:29:40,890 --> 04:29:41,310
We still don't have...

6262
04:29:41,310 --> 04:29:41,430
Wait.

6263
04:29:41,510 --> 04:29:42,530
I must have items, right?

6264
04:29:43,270 --> 04:29:44,030
Let me check.

6265
04:29:46,050 --> 04:29:46,490
Oh.

6266
04:29:46,490 --> 04:29:47,310
I have...

6267
04:29:47,310 --> 04:29:48,010
How much is that?

6268
04:29:48,390 --> 04:29:48,830
400?

6269
04:29:51,010 --> 04:29:51,890
I have...

6270
04:29:52,410 --> 04:29:52,850
No.

6271
04:29:52,890 --> 04:29:53,390
I don't have enough.

6272
04:29:55,070 --> 04:29:55,510
Okay.

6273
04:29:55,870 --> 04:29:56,130
Okay.

6274
04:29:56,130 --> 04:29:56,470
I believe.

6275
04:30:00,240 --> 04:30:00,680
Okay.

6276
04:30:00,700 --> 04:30:02,820
Actually, let's kill these guys and get level up first.

6277
04:30:03,120 --> 04:30:04,800
I want to get level up before we go in.

6278
04:30:06,900 --> 04:30:07,540
Oh, fuck.

6279
04:30:07,800 --> 04:30:08,060
Never mind.

6280
04:30:08,160 --> 04:30:08,740
He spanded on me.

6281
04:30:11,780 --> 04:30:12,320
Never mind.

6282
04:30:12,460 --> 04:30:13,380
He may or may not be better.

6283
04:30:13,560 --> 04:30:14,940
Oh, I'm going to come back for you.

6284
04:30:15,300 --> 04:30:16,400
I'm going to come back.

6285
04:30:16,500 --> 04:30:17,720
I know how to do this jump.

6286
04:30:17,720 --> 04:30:21,460
I know how I'm coming back to... Okay.

6287
04:30:24,260 --> 04:30:29,500
Okay... Let me lock in first.

6288
04:30:30,220 --> 04:30:31,280
Let me... There we go.

6289
04:30:31,720 --> 04:30:32,220
There we go.

6290
04:30:32,380 --> 04:30:33,780
I had... There was an issue.

6291
04:30:34,560 --> 04:30:36,400
I forgot to press Q.

6292
04:30:37,420 --> 04:30:38,800
Okay, I'm okay now, though.

6293
04:30:39,060 --> 04:30:41,020
Oh, I should be... No, I need like two more.

6294
04:30:42,820 --> 04:30:45,340
There was a slight issue, but I'm okay now.

6295
04:30:48,810 --> 04:30:49,570
All right.

6296
04:30:49,810 --> 04:30:50,230
Wait.

6297
04:30:50,450 --> 04:30:51,370
This way, right?

6298
04:30:52,990 --> 04:30:58,310
Where's the other... The entrance for that fucking... For those enemies.

6299
04:31:01,010 --> 04:31:01,590
Oh.

6300
04:31:03,770 --> 04:31:04,950
God, he scared me.

6301
04:31:05,310 --> 04:31:06,030
I was not ready.

6302
04:31:06,330 --> 04:31:07,770
I was actually not ready.

6303
04:31:15,010 --> 04:31:16,230
I can take them.

6304
04:31:19,270 --> 04:31:22,330
Okay, we're gonna... We're... Wait.

6305
04:31:22,470 --> 04:31:22,950
Do I have enough?

6306
04:31:23,250 --> 04:31:24,030
Three... Oh, we should.

6307
04:31:24,350 --> 04:31:24,810
Right, right?

6308
04:31:25,130 --> 04:31:26,690
It's 3,600, right?

6309
04:31:29,350 --> 04:31:30,150
Fight the birds.

6310
04:31:30,290 --> 04:31:30,810
Oh, you're right.

6311
04:31:31,050 --> 04:31:32,130
I can fight the birds.

6312
04:31:32,770 --> 04:31:34,870
The birds... Don't the birds insta-kill me, though?

6313
04:31:35,010 --> 04:31:36,550
If they hit the barrel correctly?

6314
04:31:40,690 --> 04:31:42,230
That's what I'm worried about.

6315
04:31:44,690 --> 04:31:45,730
Oh, sorry.

6316
04:31:45,930 --> 04:31:46,390
Wrong way.

6317
04:31:48,550 --> 04:31:51,690
Back down I go...

6318
04:31:51,690 --> 04:31:53,050
To hell...

6319
04:31:53,050 --> 04:31:54,070
Go back up.

6320
04:31:55,830 --> 04:31:57,590
Nah, you take those.

6321
04:31:58,270 --> 04:31:59,270
Just don't get hit.

6322
04:32:00,410 --> 04:32:01,810
It's just that easy.

6323
04:32:03,070 --> 04:32:04,630
Where the fuck... Oh, it's the birds are over here.

6324
04:32:05,390 --> 04:32:05,730
All right.

6325
04:32:11,370 --> 04:32:11,970
Hello.

6326
04:32:12,470 --> 04:32:14,010
Hello, not friendly birds.

6327
04:32:14,010 --> 04:32:14,910
Jesus.

6328
04:32:17,290 --> 04:32:18,010
Where's...

6329
04:32:19,090 --> 04:32:19,450
Okay.

6330
04:32:20,310 --> 04:32:21,330
That should be fine.

6331
04:32:22,150 --> 04:32:22,550
98.

6332
04:32:23,670 --> 04:32:24,090
All right.

6333
04:32:24,250 --> 04:32:24,950
Get over here.

6334
04:32:25,990 --> 04:32:27,450
My non-friendly birds.

6335
04:32:31,130 --> 04:32:31,490
Nice.

6336
04:32:33,510 --> 04:32:35,070
What the fuck?!

6337
04:32:37,290 --> 04:32:38,390
Ah, shit!

6338
04:32:41,090 --> 04:32:42,890
Okay, that was a little cheating.

6339
04:32:43,390 --> 04:32:45,550
Are you see- Oh!

6340
04:32:46,330 --> 04:32:46,990
No way!

6341
04:32:47,290 --> 04:32:47,710
No way!

6342
04:32:49,730 --> 04:32:51,150
Oh my god, there's no way.

6343
04:32:51,570 --> 04:32:52,570
Oh my god, buy one HP.

6344
04:32:52,890 --> 04:32:53,850
Oh my god.

6345
04:32:54,050 --> 04:32:54,430
I'm...

6346
04:32:54,430 --> 04:32:54,630
Goodbye.

6347
04:32:55,890 --> 04:32:57,170
Thanks for the appraisal.

6348
04:33:02,010 --> 04:33:03,550
Thanks for the appraisal.

6349
04:33:04,170 --> 04:33:05,070
Good timing.

6350
04:33:05,510 --> 04:33:06,230
Good timing.

6351
04:33:06,230 --> 04:33:06,650
Let me...

6352
04:33:07,350 --> 04:33:08,010
Okay.

6353
04:33:08,370 --> 04:33:10,050
Let me grab...

6354
04:33:10,050 --> 04:33:11,530
Let me use this.

6355
04:33:14,090 --> 04:33:14,750
Clutch.

6356
04:33:14,990 --> 04:33:15,650
Damn.

6357
04:33:16,230 --> 04:33:18,070
Clutch appraisal right there.

6358
04:33:20,150 --> 04:33:20,890
All right.

6359
04:33:21,230 --> 04:33:21,910
All right.

6360
04:33:22,030 --> 04:33:22,790
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

6361
04:33:22,930 --> 04:33:24,710
You guys help me decide what to love next.

6362
04:34:21,530 --> 04:34:22,230
All right.

6363
04:34:23,350 --> 04:34:23,850
Butter.

6364
04:34:24,030 --> 04:34:24,410
Metis.

6365
04:34:24,790 --> 04:34:25,290
Slake.

6366
04:34:25,510 --> 04:34:26,090
Bite size.

6367
04:34:26,350 --> 04:34:26,830
Niarr.

6368
04:34:27,410 --> 04:34:27,850
Uh...

6369
04:34:27,850 --> 04:34:28,150
Syrah.

6370
04:34:28,450 --> 04:34:28,690
Matt.

6371
04:34:28,830 --> 04:34:29,690
Thank you for the super chat.

6372
04:34:29,830 --> 04:34:30,070
Thank you.

6373
04:34:30,190 --> 04:34:30,770
Thank you.

6374
04:34:31,590 --> 04:34:32,290
All right.

6375
04:34:32,510 --> 04:34:32,770
Guys.

6376
04:34:34,150 --> 04:34:35,110
What do we do?

6377
04:34:35,610 --> 04:34:36,330
Need more?

6378
04:34:36,490 --> 04:34:36,730
Okay.

6379
04:34:36,990 --> 04:34:37,520
We need more...

6380
04:34:38,960 --> 04:34:39,520
HP.

6381
04:34:40,360 --> 04:34:41,100
All right.

6382
04:34:41,740 --> 04:34:42,740
And then...

6383
04:34:42,740 --> 04:34:44,400
I forgot what my plan was after that.

6384
04:34:44,700 --> 04:34:45,420
What was our plan?

6385
04:34:45,640 --> 04:34:46,020
Oh yeah.

6386
04:34:46,080 --> 04:34:46,780
We fight that guy.

6387
04:34:47,800 --> 04:34:49,120
I can take him now.

6388
04:34:49,400 --> 04:34:50,780
I have more HP.

6389
04:34:53,380 --> 04:34:54,280
I believe.

6390
04:35:02,000 --> 04:35:02,760
Oh yeah.

6391
04:35:03,440 --> 04:35:03,920
We don't need...

6392
04:35:03,920 --> 04:35:05,080
We upgrade our weapon later.

6393
04:35:07,900 --> 04:35:09,120
He's like over here.

6394
04:35:10,200 --> 04:35:11,160
I believe.

6395
04:35:12,020 --> 04:35:13,900
I don't have nothing to lose too.

6396
04:35:14,880 --> 04:35:16,440
I have nothing to lose!

6397
04:35:17,840 --> 04:35:19,020
Do I survive this?

6398
04:35:20,760 --> 04:35:21,640
Where is he?

6399
04:35:25,270 --> 04:35:25,790
Wait.

6400
04:35:25,890 --> 04:35:26,370
Where is he?

6401
04:35:27,190 --> 04:35:27,410
Oh!

6402
04:35:27,550 --> 04:35:28,630
Welcome to tomato farm!

6403
04:35:28,750 --> 04:35:29,470
Welcome, welcome!

6404
04:35:30,690 --> 04:35:32,530
Of course I wash my hands.

6405
04:35:33,790 --> 04:35:34,550
Where did he go?

6406
04:35:39,980 --> 04:35:40,500
Wait.

6407
04:35:40,540 --> 04:35:41,100
Where is he?

6408
04:35:41,340 --> 04:35:42,280
Who's this fucker?

6409
04:35:43,380 --> 04:35:43,740
What?

6410
04:35:43,900 --> 04:35:44,500
Free item.

6411
04:35:45,620 --> 04:35:46,600
Oh my god.

6412
04:35:46,820 --> 04:35:47,900
It didn't even matter.

6413
04:35:48,500 --> 04:35:49,080
Oh, there he is.

6414
04:35:49,240 --> 04:35:49,600
All right.

6415
04:35:50,920 --> 04:35:51,900
I hide here.

6416
04:35:52,860 --> 04:35:54,560
There's no way he sees me.

6417
04:35:55,600 --> 04:35:56,620
There's no way.

6418
04:35:57,360 --> 04:35:58,020
Wait, guys.

6419
04:35:58,140 --> 04:35:59,600
He's a little like...

6420
04:35:59,600 --> 04:36:01,560
Guys, he's a lot bigger than I thought.

6421
04:36:04,480 --> 04:36:05,000
Wait.

6422
04:36:05,420 --> 04:36:05,820
Wait.

6423
04:36:06,000 --> 04:36:06,260
Guys.

6424
04:36:10,800 --> 04:36:11,960
Wait a minute.

6425
04:36:12,780 --> 04:36:15,450
Wait, I did not realize how big he was.

6426
04:36:16,260 --> 04:36:16,720
I...

6427
04:36:20,370 --> 04:36:21,010
You know what?

6428
04:36:21,070 --> 04:36:21,290
You're right.

6429
04:36:21,430 --> 04:36:22,050
I can take him.

6430
04:36:23,570 --> 04:36:24,550
Oh my god.

6431
04:36:24,750 --> 04:36:25,430
Oh my god.

6432
04:36:25,650 --> 04:36:26,010
Oh my god.

6433
04:36:26,010 --> 04:36:27,130
Oh my god.

6434
04:36:30,700 --> 04:36:31,820
Oh shit!

6435
04:36:32,520 --> 04:36:33,260
Don't worry.

6436
04:36:33,640 --> 04:36:34,340
He doesn't...

6437
04:36:34,340 --> 04:36:34,820
Oh my god.

6438
04:36:34,840 --> 04:36:35,260
He knows.

6439
04:36:35,460 --> 04:36:37,120
He knows I'm in the bushes now.

6440
04:36:39,760 --> 04:36:40,280
Guys.

6441
04:36:41,080 --> 04:36:41,600
Guys!

6442
04:36:42,600 --> 04:36:43,100
Guys!

6443
04:36:44,060 --> 04:36:44,260
Guys!

6444
04:36:45,560 --> 04:36:46,080
Goodbye.

6445
04:36:53,120 --> 04:36:54,140
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

6446
04:36:54,400 --> 04:36:55,040
I have a plan.

6447
04:36:55,460 --> 04:36:56,460
I have a plan.

6448
04:36:57,900 --> 04:36:58,980
I have a plan.

6449
04:37:02,510 --> 04:37:03,950
I have an idea.

6450
04:37:05,050 --> 04:37:05,870
Oh, shit.

6451
04:37:06,050 --> 04:37:07,850
Oh, shit.

6452
04:37:08,590 --> 04:37:10,890
Oh, shit.

6453
04:37:13,570 --> 04:37:14,230
What's he gonna do?

6454
04:37:14,350 --> 04:37:14,790
Jump down?

6455
04:37:15,510 --> 04:37:16,190
Oh my god!

6456
04:37:16,350 --> 04:37:16,790
Oh my god!

6457
04:37:28,530 --> 04:37:30,470
Okay, my plan is I do this.

6458
04:37:31,510 --> 04:37:37,470
Okay, I thought I... I thought... Clearly, I was wrong.

6459
04:37:38,250 --> 04:37:42,150
My plan was to see if I could push him off.

6460
04:37:42,430 --> 04:37:44,650
But it clearly didn't work.

6461
04:37:46,470 --> 04:37:47,110
Okay.

6462
04:37:50,790 --> 04:37:52,370
Wait, I have an idea.

6463
04:37:53,670 --> 04:37:54,890
He'll jump down, right?

6464
04:37:55,610 --> 04:37:56,590
He's gonna jump down?

6465
04:37:56,730 --> 04:37:56,910
Yeah?

6466
04:37:57,310 --> 04:37:58,510
He's gonna jump down?

6467
04:37:58,790 --> 04:38:03,910
And then... Oh my god!

6468
04:38:04,130 --> 04:38:04,630
You're right!

6469
04:38:04,830 --> 04:38:05,530
Watch this!

6470
04:38:09,150 --> 04:38:10,070
That's right.

6471
04:38:10,310 --> 04:38:11,510
Come over here.

6472
04:38:12,830 --> 04:38:13,470
Come on!

6473
04:38:16,070 --> 04:38:17,190
Where did he go?

6474
04:38:17,190 --> 04:38:17,190
I don't know.

6475
04:38:17,930 --> 04:38:18,490
Oh!

6476
04:38:19,210 --> 04:38:19,770
Wait!

6477
04:38:24,360 --> 04:38:26,060
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

6478
04:38:26,420 --> 04:38:26,980
Wait.

6479
04:38:27,500 --> 04:38:29,140
I can push him off.

6480
04:38:32,800 --> 04:38:33,980
He doesn't stagger.

6481
04:38:34,360 --> 04:38:39,220
He... He... Oh no.

6482
04:38:39,440 --> 04:38:39,980
Oh no.

6483
04:38:40,220 --> 04:38:40,840
Oh no.

6484
04:38:40,980 --> 04:38:41,380
Oh no.

6485
04:38:41,380 --> 04:38:41,660
Oh no.

6486
04:38:41,940 --> 04:38:42,600
I have a plan.

6487
04:38:43,160 --> 04:38:44,000
He's gonna follow me.

6488
04:38:44,720 --> 04:38:45,260
Watch this.

6489
04:38:47,500 --> 04:38:48,420
Wait.

6490
04:38:48,440 --> 04:38:48,460
Wait.

6491
04:38:49,260 --> 04:38:50,440
It goes up.

6492
04:38:53,920 --> 04:38:54,840
Wait.

6493
04:38:55,740 --> 04:38:57,680
Oh, I thought that goes down.

6494
04:38:58,240 --> 04:39:01,660
I... Whoops.

6495
04:39:02,160 --> 04:39:03,220
That goes up.

6496
04:39:09,720 --> 04:39:11,880
I forgot this goes up.

6497
04:39:12,240 --> 04:39:20,020
I... I thought, like, you know, I go up the elevator and he's just gonna fall through the hole.

6498
04:39:22,140 --> 04:39:26,360
He... When he's supposed to... That was the plan.

6499
04:39:30,360 --> 04:39:31,920
Okay, wait, I can do this.

6500
04:39:32,000 --> 04:39:32,600
We can do this again.

6501
04:39:32,600 --> 04:39:33,840
I believe.

6502
04:39:37,020 --> 04:39:38,100
There's no way.

6503
04:39:38,720 --> 04:39:39,940
I almost got...

6504
04:39:39,940 --> 04:39:41,040
Wait, there's a hole!

6505
04:39:41,440 --> 04:39:42,740
Wait, it almost worked!

6506
04:39:42,980 --> 04:39:43,960
It almost worked!

6507
04:39:47,970 --> 04:39:49,570
Wait, wait, there's a hole!

6508
04:39:49,930 --> 04:39:50,330
Wait!

6509
04:39:50,890 --> 04:39:52,810
Wait, we can make this work!

6510
04:39:53,510 --> 04:39:55,470
Wait, I'm a fucking genius!

6511
04:39:57,170 --> 04:39:59,150
If there's a hole, there's a goal.

6512
04:39:59,790 --> 04:40:00,550
Where did he go?

6513
04:40:01,850 --> 04:40:02,730
This is doable.

6514
04:40:03,290 --> 04:40:06,450
This is so... Imagine the... The runes I can get, though.

6515
04:40:07,430 --> 04:40:08,290
Where is he?

6516
04:40:11,840 --> 04:40:13,000
I don't like that.

6517
04:40:13,120 --> 04:40:14,280
I don't know where he is.

6518
04:40:16,940 --> 04:40:18,100
I don't like that.

6519
04:40:23,240 --> 04:40:25,540
Wait, did he actually fall through and live?

6520
04:40:26,460 --> 04:40:26,960
Wait,

6521
04:40:31,490 --> 04:40:31,530
did he actually fall through and live?

6522
04:40:32,250 --> 04:40:33,870
Wait, he's just right there!

6523
04:40:34,570 --> 04:40:38,050
He's just...

6524
04:40:38,050 --> 04:40:39,470
Did

6525
04:40:43,720 --> 04:40:49,860
he do it?

6526
04:40:50,620 --> 04:40:51,380
Yes!

6527
04:40:53,260 --> 04:40:54,020
Yes!

6528
04:40:55,140 --> 04:40:56,460
I did it!

6529
04:40:56,980 --> 04:40:58,920
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

6530
04:41:00,440 --> 04:41:01,200
Yes!

6531
04:41:01,660 --> 04:41:02,880
I do it!

6532
04:41:03,140 --> 04:41:04,140
And there's a hole!

6533
04:41:04,380 --> 04:41:05,020
There's a goal!

6534
04:41:05,400 --> 04:41:06,960
Wait, look, he did it!

6535
04:41:08,060 --> 04:41:09,400
No way!

6536
04:41:09,400 --> 04:41:11,340
He did it!

6537
04:41:11,520 --> 04:41:12,140
He did it!

6538
04:41:12,140 --> 04:41:12,240
He did it!

6539
04:41:12,240 --> 04:41:13,380
I'm so fucking smart!

6540
04:41:13,920 --> 04:41:15,540
I didn't work!

6541
04:41:16,240 --> 04:41:17,760
I didn't work!

6542
04:41:18,080 --> 04:41:19,860
You learned nothing!

6543
04:41:20,300 --> 04:41:23,860
I learned that if there's a hole, there's always a goal!

6544
04:41:28,720 --> 04:41:29,400
It's...

6545
04:41:29,400 --> 04:41:30,560
I learned!

6546
04:41:36,280 --> 04:41:37,640
That's my...

6547
04:41:37,640 --> 04:41:38,340
Oh, gee!

6548
04:41:40,060 --> 04:41:41,800
Wait, we might be able to get loot!

6549
04:41:41,900 --> 04:41:42,720
Let's go back down!

6550
04:41:43,340 --> 04:41:44,880
Let's go back down!

6551
04:41:44,880 --> 04:41:46,640
Look, he did it.

6552
04:41:46,800 --> 04:41:47,700
I got a hat.

6553
04:41:52,720 --> 04:41:54,140
I got a hat, though.

6554
04:41:55,040 --> 04:41:55,820
Oh, there it is.

6555
04:41:56,020 --> 04:41:56,480
Oh, wait.

6556
04:41:56,760 --> 04:41:58,940
I think... I got a hat, guys.

6557
04:41:59,840 --> 04:42:01,500
It's a pretty cool hat.

6558
04:42:02,220 --> 04:42:04,060
Oh, I don't think I can get the item.

6559
04:42:04,180 --> 04:42:05,880
I think his body is gone.

6560
04:42:06,100 --> 04:42:06,220
God.

6561
04:42:09,540 --> 04:42:10,760
Oh, I got it.

6562
04:42:10,900 --> 04:42:11,180
Nice.

6563
04:42:12,300 --> 04:42:12,780
Nice.

6564
04:42:13,060 --> 04:42:14,080
That loot was a skill.

6565
04:42:14,660 --> 04:42:15,080
Sweet.

6566
04:42:20,540 --> 04:42:21,060
Nice.

6567
04:42:21,240 --> 04:42:21,820
Let's go.

6568
04:42:22,680 --> 04:42:25,200
Zero deaths from that one guy.

6569
04:42:25,940 --> 04:42:27,060
Let's fucking go.

6570
04:42:29,280 --> 04:42:29,800
Look.

6571
04:42:29,900 --> 04:42:30,020
See?

6572
04:42:30,100 --> 04:42:30,780
I told you.

6573
04:42:31,040 --> 04:42:32,620
I told you there was a way.

6574
04:42:32,860 --> 04:42:33,120
Alright.

6575
04:42:33,260 --> 04:42:34,840
Let's try and grab one more loot.

6576
04:42:34,920 --> 04:42:35,220
Oh, yeah.

6577
04:42:35,220 --> 04:42:36,000
We should...

6578
04:42:36,220 --> 04:42:36,560
Fuck.

6579
04:42:36,680 --> 04:42:37,460
I keep doing this.

6580
04:42:37,620 --> 04:42:39,400
I keep thinking this is the faster I will...

6581
04:42:40,720 --> 04:42:44,380
Some say he's still falling to this day.

6582
04:42:49,660 --> 04:42:50,260
Okay.

6583
04:42:50,720 --> 04:42:51,440
Let's see.

6584
04:42:53,800 --> 04:42:55,060
Uh... It's right here.

6585
04:42:59,080 --> 04:43:00,960
I should be able to upgrade my weapon now.

6586
04:43:04,440 --> 04:43:05,500
I knew it.

6587
04:43:06,740 --> 04:43:08,920
Work smarter, not harder.

6588
04:43:08,920 --> 04:43:09,660
Guys.

6589
04:43:10,540 --> 04:43:11,260
I'm...

6590
04:43:12,620 --> 04:43:13,340
Alright.

6591
04:43:14,940 --> 04:43:15,660
Strengthen.

6592
04:43:16,800 --> 04:43:17,160
Uh...

6593
04:43:17,520 --> 04:43:18,000
Yes.

6594
04:43:18,960 --> 04:43:20,460
Strengthen this right...

6595
04:43:20,460 --> 04:43:21,040
Right now.

6596
04:43:21,380 --> 04:43:21,940
Right now.

6597
04:43:22,580 --> 04:43:22,640
Right now.

6598
04:43:25,660 --> 04:43:27,700
Yeah, this is my first time playing it.

6599
04:43:28,620 --> 04:43:31,000
You can tell how cheesy I am.

6600
04:43:32,020 --> 04:43:32,460
Hehehehehehehe.

6601
04:43:32,900 --> 04:43:33,340
Hehehehehe.

6602
04:43:36,740 --> 04:43:37,180
Alright.

6603
04:43:37,440 --> 04:43:37,940
Let's see.

6604
04:43:40,920 --> 04:43:41,740
Hey Bandai!

6605
04:43:41,820 --> 04:43:43,580
Thanks for hanging out with us today!

6606
04:43:43,880 --> 04:43:45,080
I really appreciate it.

6607
04:43:45,220 --> 04:43:45,440
Alright.

6608
04:43:45,540 --> 04:43:46,500
Let's farm the big guy.

6609
04:43:46,640 --> 04:43:48,460
We need like 2k points so we can do...

6610
04:43:48,460 --> 04:43:51,960
We'll do one more level up and then see how I feel against...

6611
04:43:51,960 --> 04:43:53,060
Against him!

6612
04:43:53,860 --> 04:43:55,420
Only one more level up.

6613
04:43:57,320 --> 04:43:58,040
Alright.

6614
04:43:59,180 --> 04:44:01,220
This is the easiest to farm anyway.

6615
04:44:02,800 --> 04:44:03,520
Jellyfish.

6616
04:44:04,660 --> 04:44:05,380
Jellyfish!

6617
04:44:06,420 --> 04:44:07,140
Go!

6618
04:44:09,920 --> 04:44:12,840
Do your thing, my jellyfish.

6619
04:44:13,300 --> 04:44:13,980
Boom!

6620
04:44:16,800 --> 04:44:18,100
Okay, we leave now.

6621
04:44:18,600 --> 04:44:19,400
We leave.

6622
04:44:19,980 --> 04:44:21,000
We leave now.

6623
04:44:21,360 --> 04:44:23,000
Maybe he'll crush his team.

6624
04:44:23,000 --> 04:44:23,400
Mace.

6625
04:44:24,040 --> 04:44:25,080
That's like my plan.

6626
04:44:26,540 --> 04:44:27,460
Oh, shit!

6627
04:44:29,400 --> 04:44:30,740
Okay, I'll fight a little, guys.

6628
04:44:31,200 --> 04:44:31,920
You do your thing!

6629
04:44:37,520 --> 04:44:39,540
Alright, he killed his own friends.

6630
04:44:39,820 --> 04:44:40,200
That's good.

6631
04:44:42,240 --> 04:44:42,640
Okay.

6632
04:44:46,360 --> 04:44:47,000
There you go.

6633
04:44:50,560 --> 04:44:50,960
Okay.

6634
04:44:51,520 --> 04:44:51,920
Wait.

6635
04:44:52,860 --> 04:44:53,420
Oh, wait.

6636
04:44:53,680 --> 04:44:54,380
Oh, shit!

6637
04:44:54,500 --> 04:44:55,380
Why am I on my bow?

6638
04:44:55,560 --> 04:44:56,200
Why am I on my bow?

6639
04:44:56,200 --> 04:44:56,640
My bow!

6640
04:44:57,020 --> 04:44:57,500
Oh!

6641
04:44:57,840 --> 04:44:58,480
Wrong move!

6642
04:44:58,620 --> 04:44:59,020
More move!

6643
04:45:00,820 --> 04:45:01,600
Wrong move.

6644
04:45:02,220 --> 04:45:03,640
I don't know why I had my bow out.

6645
04:45:04,060 --> 04:45:04,860
That's awkward.

6646
04:45:06,080 --> 04:45:06,320
Wait.

6647
04:45:06,400 --> 04:45:07,720
Let me steal your stuff here.

6648
04:45:08,120 --> 04:45:08,800
Oh, shit!

6649
04:45:09,800 --> 04:45:10,280
Nice.

6650
04:45:15,720 --> 04:45:16,900
This input right there.

6651
04:45:17,080 --> 04:45:17,700
Oh, fuck!

6652
04:45:17,900 --> 04:45:18,100
Okay.

6653
04:45:18,160 --> 04:45:22,760
I did not realize that I had... Oh, fuck!

6654
04:45:22,900 --> 04:45:24,720
I wasn't trying to press... There you go.

6655
04:45:27,460 --> 04:45:27,940
Nice.

6656
04:45:28,080 --> 04:45:28,360
Goodbye.

6657
04:45:29,360 --> 04:45:30,120

Oh shit.

6725
04:46:03,840 --> 04:46:04,720
Oh shit.

6726
04:46:06,340 --> 04:46:07,620
Oh, yeah, I got the seeds.

6727
04:46:07,800 --> 04:46:08,160
Don't worry.

6728
04:46:08,460 --> 04:46:10,260
That was the first thing I did.

6729
04:46:13,720 --> 04:46:14,720
Oh my god.

6730
04:46:17,180 --> 04:46:17,700
Please.

6731
04:46:24,350 --> 04:46:26,610
Okay, let me heal right here.

6732
04:46:28,150 --> 04:46:29,330
Now, let's do double heal.

6733
04:46:32,410 --> 04:46:32,930
Where?

6734
04:46:33,110 --> 04:46:33,410
What if?

6735
04:46:37,710 --> 04:46:38,590
What if where?

6736
04:46:44,170 --> 04:46:44,730
Okay.

6737
04:46:45,070 --> 04:46:45,490
Fine.

6738
04:46:47,070 --> 04:46:47,850
That's fine.

6739
04:46:48,050 --> 04:46:48,350
Nice.

6740
04:46:52,590 --> 04:46:54,310
Oh my god, I can't get near the head.

6741
04:46:54,490 --> 04:46:55,070
It's too far.

6742
04:46:55,790 --> 04:46:57,270
The head is too far.

6743
04:46:57,850 --> 04:46:58,910
Pass the trail?

6744
04:46:59,270 --> 04:47:00,410
Wait, the wife is there?

6745
04:47:00,670 --> 04:47:02,150
I never saw the wife.

6746
04:47:02,710 --> 04:47:04,330
I never saw the maiden.

6747
04:47:09,040 --> 04:47:10,040
Where wife?

6748
04:47:11,800 --> 04:47:12,920
Wife important.

6749
04:47:13,260 --> 04:47:13,960
Yeah?

6750
04:47:14,820 --> 04:47:15,960
Is that woman?

6751
04:47:18,160 --> 04:47:18,860
Woman!

6752
04:47:19,700 --> 04:47:20,480
Be proud.

6753
04:47:21,500 --> 04:47:24,260
If only I had a knight!

6754
04:47:24,260 --> 04:47:25,940
And this time is the first master.

6755
04:47:26,380 --> 04:47:27,980
And the only ones left to you.

6756
04:47:29,160 --> 04:47:30,360
To a higher place.

6757
04:47:31,600 --> 04:47:32,000
Nice.

6758
04:47:39,720 --> 04:47:41,620
God, oh God, wait, wait, wait.

6759
04:47:42,160 --> 04:47:43,140
Who do we have here?

6760
04:47:43,900 --> 04:47:44,700
Tarnished, are you?

6761
04:47:45,780 --> 04:47:47,260
Clearly not one of Godric's lot.

6762
04:47:47,620 --> 04:47:48,880
I am Nefeli Lu.

6763
04:47:50,040 --> 04:47:51,820
Tarnished and warrior like you.

6764
04:47:52,300 --> 04:47:53,600
I'm here by decree of my brother.

6765
04:47:54,260 --> 04:47:55,280
He needs you, man.

6766
04:47:59,260 --> 04:48:00,580
Oh, no.

6767
04:48:08,420 --> 04:48:09,880
Oh, is this the NPC?

6768
04:48:09,880 --> 04:48:10,140
Is this the NPC?

6769
04:48:11,240 --> 04:48:13,840
I'm certain father would permit me aid the fight.

6770
04:48:16,520 --> 04:48:17,080
Apologies.

6771
04:48:17,900 --> 04:48:19,380
But I've idled long enough.

6772
04:48:19,680 --> 04:48:23,040
I swear at times we must each follow our own guidance.

6773
04:48:23,540 --> 04:48:26,600
Down whatever road takes us to the throne of Elden Lord.

6774
04:48:29,740 --> 04:48:30,340
Oh, okay.

6775
04:48:30,340 --> 04:48:30,700
Oh, okay.

6776
04:48:31,880 --> 04:48:33,080
All right, message time.

6777
04:48:33,660 --> 04:48:35,020
Every time I see a maiden.

6778
04:48:46,900 --> 04:48:47,600
Let's see.

6779
04:48:52,860 --> 04:48:53,320
Uh...

6780
04:48:56,890 --> 04:48:57,670
Where is it?

6781
04:49:00,490 --> 04:49:01,370
Where is it?

6782
04:49:01,490 --> 04:49:01,970
Where is it?

6783
04:49:01,970 --> 04:49:02,070
Where is he?

6784
04:49:08,070 --> 04:49:08,850
Joy.

6785
04:49:11,730 --> 04:49:13,810
Ah, joy.

6786
04:49:15,110 --> 04:49:16,510
Nice.

6787
04:49:25,810 --> 04:49:27,350
There we go.

6788
04:49:28,770 --> 04:49:29,570
Finally.

6789
04:49:30,150 --> 04:49:30,850
Maiden.

6790
04:49:32,890 --> 04:49:34,770
How do you summon her?

6791
04:49:36,770 --> 04:49:38,750
That's not right.

6792
04:49:39,970 --> 04:49:41,050
Alright.

6793
04:49:41,470 --> 04:49:42,530
Last level up.

6794
04:49:48,780 --> 04:49:50,320
The golden side.

6795
04:49:53,340 --> 04:49:54,980
She makes the fight trivial?

6796
04:49:55,240 --> 04:49:55,820
What does that mean?

6797
04:49:57,780 --> 04:49:58,300
Oh!

6798
04:49:58,920 --> 04:49:59,680
Before a door.

6799
04:49:59,820 --> 04:50:00,040
Okay.

6800
04:50:02,080 --> 04:50:02,600
Okay.

6801
04:50:02,820 --> 04:50:03,160
Health?

6802
04:50:03,380 --> 04:50:03,680
Okay.

6803
04:50:04,520 --> 04:50:05,220
We'll go with health.

6804
04:50:07,780 --> 04:50:08,300
Alright.

6805
04:50:08,500 --> 04:50:11,280
We're bringing the maiden along because she's woman.

6806
04:50:12,460 --> 04:50:13,580
Come with me, woman.

6807
04:50:17,160 --> 04:50:18,480
She does all the work?

6808
04:50:19,960 --> 04:50:23,240
She does most of the... Oh, it makes it super easy?

6809
04:50:26,620 --> 04:50:27,120
Oh!

6810
04:50:28,040 --> 04:50:30,300
If I get talisman out of it?

6811
04:50:30,440 --> 04:50:31,360
Oh, I like free stuff.

6812
04:50:31,800 --> 04:50:31,960
Alright.

6813
04:50:32,160 --> 04:50:32,760
I'm touching it.

6814
04:50:32,940 --> 04:50:33,700
I'm touching the side.

6815
04:50:35,700 --> 04:50:36,940
I like free stuff.

6816
04:50:39,900 --> 04:50:40,400
Hello.

6817
04:50:42,480 --> 04:50:43,640
Free stuff time.

6818
04:50:47,330 --> 04:50:48,630
Oh, hey, Tenjin.

6819
04:50:49,870 --> 04:50:51,010
Come over here.

6820
04:50:51,530 --> 04:50:53,190
Oh, she has double axes too.

6821
04:50:53,990 --> 04:50:54,890
I believe.

6822
04:50:58,470 --> 04:50:58,990
Alright.

6823
04:51:00,570 --> 04:51:01,730
It's been a while.

6824
04:51:03,770 --> 04:51:04,810
Wait, where is she?

6825
04:51:05,010 --> 04:51:07,270
I was gonna be like, where did she go?

6826
04:51:07,970 --> 04:51:09,550
Hey, why is he looking at me?

6827
04:51:09,550 --> 04:51:10,930
Hey.

6828
04:51:10,990 --> 04:51:22,150
E- E- E- E- E- A- E- Agro는x Jesus cri- what- what the- What the fuck?

6829
04:51:22,570 --> 04:51:29,510
A- A- What the fuck what the fuck?

6830
04:51:29,510 --> 04:51:31,370
The wind attack really?

6831
04:51:35,150 --> 04:51:37,210
R U S Oh my god.

6832
04:51:37,210 --> 04:51:38,830
I forgot about how to fight him.

6833
04:51:39,010 --> 04:51:40,090
It's been so long, guys.

6834
04:51:40,270 --> 04:51:42,050
I actually forgot how to fight this guy.

6835
04:51:42,230 --> 04:51:43,330
It's been way too long.

6836
04:51:47,490 --> 04:51:48,450
Jesus Christ.

6837
04:51:49,350 --> 04:51:50,530
Oh my god, okay.

6838
04:51:54,170 --> 04:51:55,870
Oh my god, Jesus.

6839
04:51:59,430 --> 04:52:01,230
I forgot how to fight him.

6840
04:52:06,770 --> 04:52:09,130
Like, his win attack is actually crazy, though.

6841
04:52:12,650 --> 04:52:13,170
Okay.

6842
04:52:16,940 --> 04:52:17,980
I'm backing up.

6843
04:52:18,160 --> 04:52:19,380
Oh, he's using the dragon.

6844
04:52:23,860 --> 04:52:25,000
How do I skip?

6845
04:52:25,380 --> 04:52:26,020
Oh, skip.

6846
04:52:26,280 --> 04:52:27,460
I don't need to see that again.

6847
04:52:27,720 --> 04:52:28,880
Because I might die.

6848
04:52:33,120 --> 04:52:34,180
Oh my god.

6849
04:52:37,800 --> 04:52:38,200
Okay.

6850
04:52:40,320 --> 04:52:41,000
It's okay.

6851
04:52:43,440 --> 04:52:43,840
Again?

6852
04:52:45,240 --> 04:52:47,020
Oh, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

6853
04:52:47,060 --> 04:52:47,820
He's using it on him.

6854
04:52:53,270 --> 04:52:55,650
No, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge!

6855
04:52:56,330 --> 04:52:56,730
Dodge!

6856
04:52:59,130 --> 04:52:59,530
Okay.

6857
04:52:59,530 --> 04:53:00,130
That's fine.

6858
04:53:03,250 --> 04:53:04,050
Oh, shit.

6859
04:53:04,190 --> 04:53:04,690
That's not fine.

6860
04:53:10,060 --> 04:53:11,100
Dodge, dodge, dodge.

6861
04:53:11,340 --> 04:53:11,940
Oh my god.

6862
04:53:12,220 --> 04:53:13,160
You do so much.

6863
04:53:13,520 --> 04:53:15,000
Oh my god.

6864
04:53:15,480 --> 04:53:16,060
Thank you.

6865
04:53:16,200 --> 04:53:17,820
I told you I'm not maiden-less.

6866
04:53:18,460 --> 04:53:18,940
I...

6867
04:53:21,460 --> 04:53:22,680
Look at her go.

6868
04:53:25,160 --> 04:53:26,320
I knew it.

6869
04:53:26,720 --> 04:53:27,540
Thank you, wife.

6870
04:53:28,200 --> 04:53:28,880
Thank you.

6871
04:53:29,020 --> 04:53:30,560
See, I didn't let her die.

6872
04:53:30,560 --> 04:53:31,940
She's okay.

6873
04:53:33,160 --> 04:53:35,060
I didn't let her die.

6874
04:53:35,320 --> 04:53:35,900
Look at that.

6875
04:53:36,700 --> 04:53:38,040
I'm a good person.

6876
04:53:38,940 --> 04:53:41,000
I defeated have lost her beneficial power.

6877
04:53:41,140 --> 04:53:43,440
However, their power can be restored at Divine Towers.

6878
04:53:44,040 --> 04:53:46,500
Discover which Divine Tower you should visit.

6879
04:53:47,380 --> 04:53:47,860
What?

6880
04:53:48,440 --> 04:53:49,560
What does that mean?

6881
04:53:51,160 --> 04:53:52,180
Look at that.

6882
04:53:52,360 --> 04:53:52,740
Look at that.

6883
04:53:52,740 --> 04:53:53,340
I told you.

6884
04:53:53,860 --> 04:53:54,500
Ah, joy.

6885
04:53:55,140 --> 04:53:55,540
I...

6886
04:53:56,140 --> 04:53:59,120
Josh, welcome to the tomato farm.

6887
04:53:59,620 --> 04:54:00,300
Welcome, welcome.

6888
04:54:02,640 --> 04:54:04,260
Johnny, thank you for the super chat.

6889
04:54:04,400 --> 04:54:05,360
Thank you, thank you.

6890
04:54:06,840 --> 04:54:07,800
Easy clap.

6891
04:54:08,040 --> 04:54:08,500
Let's go.

6892
04:54:11,360 --> 04:54:12,360
I told you.

6893
04:54:13,040 --> 04:54:13,980
Ah, joy.

6894
04:54:22,180 --> 04:54:23,660
Oh, that long, long court.

6895
04:54:23,840 --> 04:54:24,840
Oh, the one with the lion?

6896
04:54:25,180 --> 04:54:26,260
The witch and the wardrobe?

6897
04:54:30,240 --> 04:54:30,760
Oh, hey.

6898
04:54:30,940 --> 04:54:31,480
Hey there, buddy.

6899
04:54:32,660 --> 04:54:33,680
Nice seeing you here.

6900
04:54:38,740 --> 04:54:40,560
All right, what's next?

6901
04:54:45,380 --> 04:54:46,440
Let's see.

6902
04:54:47,220 --> 04:54:48,620
Chilling with the ghost.

6903
04:54:50,120 --> 04:54:52,100
Is it more health time?

6904
04:54:52,460 --> 04:54:54,280
I could do a lot of health.

6905
04:54:55,320 --> 04:54:56,260
Until 30?

6906
04:54:57,300 --> 04:54:58,500
Jesus Christ.

6907
04:54:58,500 --> 04:55:01,080
What about, like, my attacks, guys?

6908
04:55:05,740 --> 04:55:06,920
Get it to 30.

6909
04:55:07,320 --> 04:55:07,740
All right.

6910
04:55:10,320 --> 04:55:12,060
All right, I'm almost at 30 anyway.

6911
04:55:12,840 --> 04:55:13,360
Hey, buddy.

6912
04:55:17,260 --> 04:55:18,140
Let's see.

6913
04:55:18,580 --> 04:55:19,500
Is there anything here?

6914
04:55:20,420 --> 04:55:20,940
No?

6915
04:55:21,220 --> 04:55:21,380
Okay.

6916
04:55:21,740 --> 04:55:22,120
We have...

6917
04:55:22,980 --> 04:55:23,560
So what is the...

6918
04:55:23,560 --> 04:55:25,380
The towers is the...

6919
04:55:25,920 --> 04:55:27,080
The lion, right?

6920
04:55:27,340 --> 04:55:28,320
Where the lions are?

6921
04:55:32,150 --> 04:55:32,670
Right?

6922
04:55:34,470 --> 04:55:34,990
Yeah?

6923
04:55:35,350 --> 04:55:35,890
All right.

6924
04:55:36,230 --> 04:55:36,970
I'm gonna head to...

6925
04:55:37,790 --> 04:55:38,590
I'm gonna head here.

6926
04:55:39,290 --> 04:55:40,590
All right, we're gonna call it here.

6927
04:55:44,270 --> 04:55:45,590
Yes, but talk...

6928
04:55:45,590 --> 04:55:46,590
But till this...

6929
04:55:46,590 --> 04:55:47,110
Talk to this...

6930
04:55:47,110 --> 04:55:47,710
Which dude?

6931
04:55:48,470 --> 04:55:49,310
Which dude?

6932
04:55:50,270 --> 04:55:52,390
Which guy am I supposed to talk to?

6933
04:55:55,650 --> 04:55:57,850
I mean, I killed two bosses, you know?

6934
04:55:58,050 --> 04:55:59,030
I think that's good enough.

6935
04:55:59,030 --> 04:56:00,410
Wait, is that my message?

6936
04:56:02,090 --> 04:56:03,890
Yeah, that's my message.

6937
04:56:06,910 --> 04:56:08,790
A high flick sinky with...

6938
04:56:08,790 --> 04:56:10,050
Welcome to tomato farm.

6939
04:56:10,350 --> 04:56:10,990
Welcome, welcome.

6940
04:56:11,270 --> 04:56:12,750
Oh, he was at the boss room?

6941
04:56:12,950 --> 04:56:13,570
Oh yeah.

6942
04:56:13,790 --> 04:56:14,770
Is my message still here?

6943
04:56:14,990 --> 04:56:16,230
Wait, how many praises do you get?

6944
04:56:18,530 --> 04:56:19,210
Jenner...

6945
04:56:19,750 --> 04:56:22,070
If only I had a lover.

6946
04:56:26,450 --> 04:56:27,130
Nice...

6947
04:56:31,350 --> 04:56:32,030
Okay.

6948
04:56:32,770 --> 04:56:33,950
Oh, right here?

6949
04:56:33,950 --> 04:56:34,670
At Godric?

6950
04:56:34,950 --> 04:56:35,990
There's a guy here.

6951
04:56:39,400 --> 04:56:39,940
Nice.

6952
04:56:40,240 --> 04:56:41,440
All right, let's talk to him.

6953
04:56:42,720 --> 04:56:43,660
Where is he?

6954
04:56:44,300 --> 04:56:45,340
There's a guy here?

6955
04:56:45,700 --> 04:56:47,140
Where the fuck is that guy?

6956
04:56:48,780 --> 04:56:49,900
Oh, there he is.

6957
04:56:50,040 --> 04:56:52,320
I thought he was... Time for joy!

6958
04:56:57,600 --> 04:56:58,140
Oh.

6959
04:57:04,420 --> 04:57:04,960
Hello.

6960
04:57:06,680 --> 04:57:08,300
Oh my god, wait, that's Godric.

6961
04:57:12,500 --> 04:57:12,840
Oh.

6962
04:57:13,420 --> 04:57:16,220
He has issues.

6963
04:57:18,380 --> 04:57:20,060
Yeah, this guy has issues.

6964
04:57:20,060 --> 04:57:22,300
Hello there.

6965
04:57:23,940 --> 04:57:30,360
This weasel was... Godric was always looking down on me.

6966
04:57:31,060 --> 04:57:34,240
He got what he bloody deserve thanks to you.

6967
04:57:34,840 --> 04:57:35,760
I'll tell you though.

6968
04:57:36,180 --> 04:57:36,980
Yeah, all me.

6969
04:57:37,200 --> 04:57:37,760
All us.

6970
04:57:37,980 --> 04:57:39,120
Me and my dragoons.

6971
04:57:39,120 --> 04:57:40,400
He had an ugly heart.

6972
04:57:40,400 --> 04:57:41,160
He had an ugly heart.

6973
04:57:41,200 --> 04:57:43,120
An ugly countenance.

6974
04:57:44,240 --> 04:57:47,200
And met the ugliest of ends, eh?

6975
04:57:53,260 --> 04:57:54,780
Me and my wife, you're right.

6976
04:57:55,000 --> 04:57:56,040
Oh, I can buy stuff?

6977
04:57:57,340 --> 04:57:58,000
What have you got theFT.

6978
04:57:58,000 --> 04:58:00,800
Sievel pickled fowl foot.oder.

6979
04:58:00,920 --> 04:58:02,020
temple boost item discovery.

6980
04:58:02,280 --> 04:58:02,640
Proalog.

6981
04:58:02,780 --> 04:58:03,320
It reveals co -op.

6982
04:58:03,920 --> 04:58:06,240
I mean, it doesn't feel like there's anything for it.

6983
04:58:12,360 --> 04:58:14,380
Yeah, it doesn't feel like arrows?

6984
04:58:14,580 --> 04:58:15,320
We don't need that.

6985
04:58:16,800 --> 04:58:17,280
Okay.

6986
04:58:17,780 --> 04:58:18,280
Is that it?

6987
04:58:20,160 --> 04:58:21,160
Wait, the armor?

6988
04:58:21,480 --> 04:58:22,760
Is the armor good?

6989
04:58:27,010 --> 04:58:28,190
Armor and weapons.

6990
04:58:28,630 --> 04:58:30,230
I mean, he doesn't have any weapons.

6991
04:58:30,230 --> 04:58:31,150
He just has...

6992
04:58:32,330 --> 04:58:34,990
I feel like... Do I... Should I get the armor?

6993
04:58:35,870 --> 04:58:36,350
Nah?

6994
04:58:36,950 --> 04:58:37,430
Alright.

6995
04:58:40,590 --> 04:58:42,330
Oh, it's the band that's starting.

6996
04:58:42,550 --> 04:58:42,690
Okay.

6997
04:58:43,470 --> 04:58:44,010
Alright, goodbye.

6998
04:58:44,370 --> 04:58:45,530
Alright, we're gonna call it here.

6999
04:58:46,570 --> 04:58:48,470
Oh my... Oh my god, we've been going for five hours.

7000
04:58:48,650 --> 04:58:49,050
Holy shit.

7001
04:58:49,170 --> 04:58:50,350
I mean, five hours, two bosses?

7002
04:58:50,830 --> 04:58:52,170
That's good progress right there.

7003
04:58:54,550 --> 04:58:54,910
Whoops.

7004
04:58:55,330 --> 04:58:56,890
Oh, I don't wanna get that out of here.

7005
04:58:57,430 --> 04:58:57,790
Oh!

7006
04:58:58,230 --> 04:58:58,970
That was fun!

7007
04:59:00,070 --> 04:59:01,490
That was really fun, guys.

7008
04:59:01,630 --> 04:59:02,390
Wait, how do I save?

7009
04:59:05,090 --> 04:59:05,450
System...

7010
04:59:06,830 --> 04:59:08,490
Is it automatically save for me?

7011
04:59:09,170 --> 04:59:10,790
I hope it's saved!

7012
04:59:15,970 --> 04:59:17,310
Oh, just exit the game?

7013
04:59:17,510 --> 04:59:17,790
But yeah!

7014
04:59:18,110 --> 04:59:19,170
Thank you, everybody, for coming!

7015
04:59:19,490 --> 04:59:22,430
I had a great time playing Eldering for the first time.

7016
04:59:23,330 --> 04:59:24,870
To be fair, I'm cheesing a lot.

7017
04:59:24,870 --> 04:59:25,110
I...

7018
04:59:26,570 --> 04:59:32,070
I hope you guys are enjoying my playthrough, despite all the cheesing I'm doing!

7019
04:59:35,050 --> 04:59:38,150
I hope you guys have fun watching.

7020
04:59:38,730 --> 04:59:41,230
I do play it quite uniquely.

7021
04:59:41,650 --> 04:59:44,110
There's nothing wrong with cheese.

7022
04:59:44,110 --> 04:59:45,450
My rat...

7023
04:59:45,450 --> 04:59:45,610
My rat...

7024
04:59:45,610 --> 04:59:46,090
Look!

7025
04:59:46,290 --> 04:59:47,330
I have...

7026
04:59:47,330 --> 04:59:49,030
I do play Souls games.

7027
04:59:49,510 --> 04:59:50,450
Very...

7028
04:59:51,410 --> 04:59:53,030
Very special.

7029
04:59:54,130 --> 05:00:00,990
If you watch my Bloodborne playthrough, it was very similar to how I played Bloodborne.

7030
05:00:01,210 --> 05:00:03,070
Because I love the cheese.

7031
05:00:07,590 --> 05:00:10,270
I play it in a very particular way.

7032
05:00:14,110 --> 05:00:16,030
Dork, thank you for the super chat.

7033
05:00:16,190 --> 05:00:17,030
Thank you, thank you.

7034
05:00:17,150 --> 05:00:20,190
I'm ready for another Simpsons save moment.

7035
05:00:20,190 --> 05:00:22,550
But it's definitely been really fun.

7036
05:00:22,570 --> 05:00:23,530
Look, guys.

7037
05:00:23,690 --> 05:00:28,870
I could have spent an hour trying to kill the big, big bulky guard guy.

7038
05:00:29,190 --> 05:00:31,590
But instead, I just made him fall.

7039
05:00:31,890 --> 05:00:33,290
And saved myself...

7040
05:00:34,130 --> 05:00:35,170
40 minutes.

7041
05:00:36,390 --> 05:00:38,590
And saved myself...

7042
05:00:38,590 --> 05:00:40,750
50 minutes of trying to kill him.

7043
05:00:40,890 --> 05:00:42,190
That's all I'm saying.

7044
05:00:44,950 --> 05:00:46,050
So true.

7045
05:00:51,830 --> 05:00:52,470
Problem solved.

7046
05:00:53,850 --> 05:00:54,170
Anyway.

7047
05:00:54,690 --> 05:00:55,470
That was really fun.

7048
05:00:56,370 --> 05:00:57,570
Rodrigo, thank you for the super chat.

7049
05:00:57,690 --> 05:00:58,490
Thank you, thank you.

7050
05:00:58,670 --> 05:00:59,770
It was a lot of fun and so fun.

7051
05:00:59,810 --> 05:01:00,390
You're so adorable.

7052
05:01:00,510 --> 05:01:01,590
Never change your cheese away.

7053
05:01:01,710 --> 05:01:02,490
Thank you for the super chat.

7054
05:01:02,570 --> 05:01:03,090
Thank you, thank you.

7055
05:01:03,250 --> 05:01:04,650
I'm glad everybody had a fun time.

7056
05:01:04,810 --> 05:01:06,450
I always love streaming for you guys.

7057
05:01:06,990 --> 05:01:07,870
I'm gonna call it here.

7058
05:01:08,650 --> 05:01:09,910
Thank you all for watching.

7059
05:01:11,210 --> 05:01:11,530
Tomorrow...

7060
05:01:11,530 --> 05:01:12,970
I don't even remember what I'm streaming tomorrow.

7061
05:01:13,790 --> 05:01:15,730
Is it Simpsons or Dynasty Warriors?

7062
05:01:15,750 --> 05:01:16,530
I don't remember.

7063
05:01:17,490 --> 05:01:17,810
Um...

7064
05:01:18,230 --> 05:01:19,170
I'm like...

7065
05:01:19,170 --> 05:01:20,390
I lost track of my schedule.

7066
05:01:20,850 --> 05:01:21,490
I...

7067
05:01:21,490 --> 05:01:23,330
Is it Dynasty Warriors?

7068
05:01:23,590 --> 05:01:27,430
Guys, I spent like an hour and a half leveling up in Dynasty Warriors.

7069
05:01:27,430 --> 05:01:28,710
Because I was like...

7070
05:01:28,710 --> 05:01:29,810
I am not...

7071
05:01:29,810 --> 05:01:30,250
I'm not...

7072
05:01:30,250 --> 05:01:31,210
And then I had to Google...

7073
05:01:31,210 --> 05:01:32,410
I was like Googling like...

7074
05:01:32,410 --> 05:01:32,890
What...

7075
05:01:32,890 --> 05:01:34,930
What builds do I need to do?

7076
05:01:35,030 --> 05:01:36,910
Because I'm not gonna...

7077
05:01:37,370 --> 05:01:42,650
We're not having another part 11 or part 12 in Dynasty Warriors.

7078
05:01:42,650 --> 05:01:45,050
We are finishing that game tomorrow.

7079
05:01:45,590 --> 05:01:45,970
Uh...

7080
05:01:45,970 --> 05:01:46,050
Check.

7081
05:01:46,250 --> 05:01:47,170
Thank you to the super chat.

7082
05:01:47,290 --> 05:01:47,530
Thank you.

7083
05:01:47,670 --> 05:01:48,150
Thank you.

7084
05:01:48,450 --> 05:01:49,330
Dough Kitty isn't real.

7085
05:01:49,490 --> 05:01:50,290
She can't hurt me.

7086
05:01:50,450 --> 05:01:52,470
Dough Kitty pushes him down a hole.

7087
05:01:52,790 --> 05:01:53,630
Thank you for the super chat.

7088
05:01:53,730 --> 05:01:53,950
Thank you.

7089
05:01:54,030 --> 05:01:54,370
Thank you.

7090
05:01:54,570 --> 05:01:55,090
Hey guys.

7091
05:01:55,310 --> 05:01:55,970
I'm gonna...

7092
05:01:55,970 --> 05:01:56,890
I'm gonna call it here.

7093
05:01:57,030 --> 05:01:57,590
As always everybody.

7094
05:01:57,830 --> 05:01:58,570
Stay hydrated.

7095
05:01:58,750 --> 05:01:59,190
Posture check.

7096
05:01:59,370 --> 05:02:00,950
Get them around to get that blood flowing.

7097
05:02:01,050 --> 05:02:01,490
And if you...

7098
05:02:01,490 --> 05:02:02,130
Stay up for me.

7099
05:02:02,270 --> 05:02:02,890
Head to bed.

7100
05:02:03,090 --> 05:02:03,490
Cause...

7101
05:02:03,490 --> 05:02:04,230
You deserve it.

7102
05:02:04,230 --> 05:02:05,050
Before I go.

7103
05:02:05,070 --> 05:02:06,230
My show of the day.

7104
05:02:07,050 --> 05:02:07,530
Um...

7105
05:02:07,530 --> 05:02:08,410
I still have my hi...

And bye, bye, bye, bye.
