00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,460
Hello, Sleepy Bird is back again.

2
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,880
Two days in a row.

3
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,220
I'm here.

4
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,900
I'm here and I'm alive.

5
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,060
Well, physically, yes, mentally, no.

6
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,760
But good morning, good morning, everyone.

7
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:31,080
not on the schedule but if you guys remember I am got I yeah
it's okay the drafting is 30 for 30 minutes long so I have

8
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:44,300
30 minutes to to get ready um but yeah I know I sound like
I'm fucking dying I know I do not sound okay right now I I

9
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:58,720
do not sound my my throat my throat is having a wild time
now um any anyway i i am awake and um for those who don't

10
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:09,440
know we got last minute invited to super tfs 200k
invitational uh where every team must have a deadpool on

11
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:18,020
their team what team are you gonna be on dokeybird i don't
know um because they are they are drafting the team right

12
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:30,080
now um but The team captains are Super, Tyler 1, Necroz,
Flats, E-Rob, and XQC.

13
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,400
And it's like a round robin.

14
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,600
It's going to be round robin at first.

15
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:39,000
And then after that is best of one.

16
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,420
After everyone round robins, it's best of one.

17
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,000
And then we'll see how that goes.

18
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,100
We could end super early or we could go all the way to the
end.

19
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,800
I honestly, at this point in my life, either works for me.

20
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:07,320
At this, at this point of time, of how I feel right now, if
we get eliminated, like, eliminated first, that's okay for

21
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:07,600
me.

22
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:11,820
If we get eliminated less, I'm also okay with that.

23
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,220
They're both, they're both positives for me at this point.

24
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:26,600
as long as I get to have fun with my team that's all I care
about because like okay so you know how during the early

25
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:34,600
access I was like oh support Deadpool's like she's not that
great it's so confusing so apparently it's crazy you know

26
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:43,200
after people played Deadpool for like because apparently the
season launched like a couple of hours ago and people

27
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:51,820
already figured out that support Deadpool actually really
strong so i'm like oh shit okay well fuck um i don't

28
00:04:51,820 --> 00:05:01,120
understand how to play this character fuck like support i
knew tank deadpool was really strong i thought dps deadpool

29
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:07,660
was pretty sick too but apparently if you know how to play
support deadpool he's actually a pretty good character and

30
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,980
i'm like bro i don't even know what the fuck i was doing i
was just mashing

31
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:21,580
Yeah, so it already took people, like, I don't know, three
to four hours to be like, no, I support Deadpool is actually

32
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:29,280
one of the strongest Deadpool's, and I'm like, oh, shit,
well, fuck, I guess one of the support players got to learn

33
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,240
Deadpool now during this tournament.

34
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,160
And also, more supports is now meta.

35
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,240
I, oh, no.

36
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,200
What else can I say about that?

37
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:55,460
oh no it's like two tanks for supports welcome back goats um
people apparently are winning games with two tanks for

38
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:02,400
supports with Deadpool as one of the supports and I was like
oh that's not good

39
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:13,300
I'm like that's that's not that's not good that seems very
wrong

40
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:24,880
it's not like hard hard meta but people have been winning
games with four supports um in rank so we'll see how that

41
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,580
goes as well i don't know if people are gonna be playing
that in the tournament but we'll see i'm nervous because

42
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:38,440
there's a lot of big content creators in this tournament i'm
like a small fish compared to these people so so oh wow okay

43
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:48,780
uh um oh let me let me open my eyes let me don't worry guys
let me open my eyes

44
00:06:53,580 --> 00:07:00,700
I don't know if I should play this is how I actually feel
but like

45
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:14,940
but like I feel like you'll see more emotions from me if I
open my eyes uh let me get yeah let me get some eye yeah let

46
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:19,700
me get some eye drops real quick plop plop oh

47
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:33,660
okay all right when our games begin when our games begin
i'll open up my eyes um what else oh did you guys see the

48
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:45,000
fuck they're being back the fat Pikachu he's coming back Fat
Pikachu can finally leave the diet He don't need a diet no

49
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:56,060
more Yeah lay off that Ozenpik Pikachu Uh but they're
bringing back fat Pikachu Like the classic fat Pikachu Um in

50
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:02,660
In plushie back then I'm so I actually want to order it like
after the stream I have to figure out how to order it

51
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:08,120
because apparently it's like You can order it on Amazon I
think you can order it on like proxy sites right want to

52
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:14,900
figure that shit out maybe not after this stream i'll figure
it later um but i'm gonna yeah he's like he's like he

53
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:21,000
basically doesn't have to do modeling work anymore and then
he's like yum yum yum yum and now he's fat again he's my fat

54
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:31,060
little pikachu um anyway so i'm that's an important life
update fat pikachu is back that's very important um all

55
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:39,020
right are they drafting all right let's see i also i did not
you know ever since the early access that's all i of that's

56
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:47,540
all i uh that's all i i did i didn't touch him since because
i literally i personally thought i was just like there's no

57
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:55,000
i i personally just thought that support deadpool was not
gonna be it but then silly me oh yeah also here's a little

58
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:03,860
fun tip for those who don't want to read an essay i i
discovered this recently so um look at this i saw this on

59
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:08,620
twitter so because i I was like, bro, this is like a, I feel
like I fucking need a PhD.

60
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,140
So look at this.

61
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:16,320
Do you guys notice a very significant difference in text
now?

62
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,440
And how, like a switch to a dual pistol.

63
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,380
So, you know, if you want to read less, it's a lot.

64
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,700
Yeah, it's a lot less now.

65
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,300
Because apparently there is a setting for Deadpool.

66
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,380
It's like crazy.

67
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,580
any of the Deadpool's.

68
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,720
I know you have to do this for all three Deadpool's, by the
way.

69
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,700
And then you scroll down.

70
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:46,180
There is Deadpool style ability descriptions.

71
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:57,620
So the reason why it was so fucking long and so confusing is
because Deadpool himself wrote the descriptions of the

72
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,100
ability.

73
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,480
So the more I turn this on.

74
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,340
I turn this on.

75
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:00,840
What is this?

76
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,340
This is the tank Deadpool.

77
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:12,660
And then let me go this would and then it's a that's like 20
like slice and dice anyone trying to get near my team gets

78
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:20,520
the business at both katanas the mood's so good my teammates
will never forget my dazzling and then i go here i go here

79
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,220
swap to dual katanas

80
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:43,590
i'm like oh my god okay i think i can understand this
character now So here's a little fun little tip for those

81
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:46,250
who are like, what the fuck is he saying?

82
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:58,870
Yeah, so now, now his ability, his like tutorial thing is
much more readable now.

83
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,210
I bro, it's 12 p.m.

84
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:08,630
I cannot, I cannot fucking, I need to figure this out
because I, I don't know if I'm playing Deadpool or whoever

85
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,130
or my other support is.

86
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,870
playing Deadpool.

87
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:17,530
Like I gotta figure this because apparently Deadpool is,
support Deadpool is very strong guys.

88
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,850
Like I need to know what's going on.

89
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,770
I know I did an early access but I already forgot.

90
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:32,330
I already forgot what's going on.

91
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:34,130
Yeah.

92
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:34,290
Yeah.

93
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,690
Everyone else has been fucking practicing him.

94
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:39,490
Okay.

95
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,610
So let's see.

96
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:55,270
before I'm a remove okay so support it'll be like I assume
like I have to use my E a lot but they're dead so it's not

97
00:11:55,270 --> 00:12:05,890
my fault I assume like I have to use this and I knew that a
lot too and then when I have to I swap

98
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:22,150
yeah but it's so I do so little damage with my katanas
though Yeah, and then and then I do the Q All right, I need

99
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:30,570
to remember I definitely need to remember to um Why is she
or can I okay

100
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:42,680
Okay I can't how the fuck do I get that full combo?

101
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:43,560
How?

102
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,540
I guess I have to like, it has to be like everybody in front
of me.

103
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:47,220
Yeah.

104
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,720
So, I don't know.

105
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,400
We'll figure it out live.

106
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,620
Well, we'll figure it out live, I guess.

107
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,640
Well, we can figure it out.

108
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,220
Yeah.

109
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,040
I need to use both E's and the head jumps.

110
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,720
Jesus Christ.

111
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:10,280
Okay.

112
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,960
I was going to say how to fuck.

113
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,760
Do I get both combos?

114
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:15,740
Alright.

115
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,380
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

116
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,870
Oh my god.

117
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:28,730
I'm only at five.

118
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,670
That's as furthest as I can get.

119
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:32,450
Whatever.

120
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,350
Our team dies.

121
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,250
Whatever.

122
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,990
Our team dies when I play Deadpool.

123
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:39,830
That's fine.

124
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,150
I've accepted it.

125
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:44,450
Penny's strong.

126
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,350
But like, it is what it is.

127
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:48,970
It is.

128
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,890
It is what it is.

129
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,370
More bounce.

130
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:56,590
I'm not used to just randomly bouncing.

131
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:56,890
Oh, wait.

132
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,090
Let me see if I can bounce on them.

133
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,310
God, bounce on their heads.

134
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:01,550
All right.

135
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,510
Well, let me kill him.

136
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:06,790
All right.

137
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:07,370
Let me see.

138
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,450
Boing, boing, boing.

139
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:11,670
Oh, my God.

140
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,030
Okay.

141
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,590
All right.

142
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,590
I got this.

143
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,270
I figured it out.

144
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,270
Guys, I figured it out.

145
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,310
Okay, let me fucking queue.

146
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,850
How come sometimes I can't...

147
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,250
Okay, I have to get an S.

148
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,930
Oh my god, I already fucked up the bounce.

149
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:35,650
Alright, so whatever.

150
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:36,550
Our team dies.

151
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:41,730
Okay, guys, whatever.

152
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,350
Our team dies.

153
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,270
That's the...

154
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,550
I accepted it.

155
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,190
Let's leave.

156
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:51,610
Let's leave.

157
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,350
Oh my god.

158
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:54,810
I need to learn a new support.

159
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:56,310
It's okay.

160
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:59,590
Maybe everyone else wants to play Deadpool, so I never have
to play Deadpool.

161
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,170
I'm just going on with that.

162
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:02,330
That belief.

163
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,230

They're drafting.

176
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,450
They're drafting now.

177
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:35,930
Wait, am I on a team already?

178
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,140

that makes me happy

188
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,730
playing everything but rivals.

189
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,590
I do not think he got stronger.

190
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,980
I do not think he got stronger, guys.

191
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:47,370
All right.

192
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:48,910
That's cute.

193
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:50,890
That's what makes me happy.

194
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,070
That makes me happy.

195
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,330
All right.

196
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,310
It's all right.

197
00:17:58,490 --> 00:17:59,010
It's fine.

198
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,510
If we lose, at least I'm on the fight.

199
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:12,530
fun team bro it's gonna even with lose at least i know with
moxie and tyler it's gonna be a fun team yeah but we

200
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:22,690
definitely need an actual tank player that can like um i'm
sorry but like tyler one can only play venom and we sort of

201
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:37,590
need a shield tank we sort of need a shield tank guys well
moxie plays captain america technically it's a shield take

202
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:49,630
too but we need moxie on dps guys he needs to be on dps i
think that's the only way bro i'm pulling up the draft now i

203
00:18:49,630 --> 00:19:00,890
didn't know who's on whose team all right bro brum bro i
mean he was carrying as venom for the longest time and then

204
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:10,430
and then And then, um, the one, then one, we faced the,
like, during the, um, sorry, I'm tired, my brain, my, I

205
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:16,030
still, I'm looking for a hamster to run on the wheel, so
there's no hamster right now in my brain, it's just empty,

206
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:20,750
but, and then he got target banned, and then we got knocked
out instantly.

207
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:39,310
We got, guys, the last time, he was carrying on venom, and
then he got target banned, and then it was, a g g yeah oh

208
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:46,350
wait we don't have the gale that's true gale and i are not
on a team together so we don't have the negative chemistry

209
00:19:46,350 --> 00:20:00,510
that's true our curse if you put dokeybird and gale on the
same team together it activates the curse we're good like

210
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:12,170
individual wise But when we put us two to get it, we have we
it's surprising that we have a zero 0% 0% score on

211
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,790
tournaments together as a team

212
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:22,110
The negative team up exactly it is actually the negative
team up right now

213
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:37,260
Yeah I don't even know that Who's they don't even they have
I've not displayed like the overall team now.

214
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:42,040
It's just watching people pick and it's disappearing.

215
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,800
I'm trying to see who's on my team other than me and Moxie.

216
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,020
Does anyone know who else is on my team other than me and
Moxie?

217
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,040
Also, I'm pretty sure Tyler did not research all the other
players.

218
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:15,840
I think he's picking off my vibes guys I'm yeah I'm pretty
sure he picked on vibes I don't even think he knows who

219
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,520
plays what role I

220
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:33,720
he's got the sea but it's really weird guys we might guys we
might have a short stream today but at least we'll have fun

221
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,080
We got to see Tyler won again.

222
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,780
I'm so happy.

223
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:42,260
I never died actually doing stuff with Tyler.

224
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:45,660
But we did in the last XQC tournament.

225
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,440
And now he picked me.

226
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,500
And it makes me...

227
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,420
I'm like, yeah!

228
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,120
He remembers me.

229
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:58,710
Yeah.

230
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:08,090
Guys, if he's picking out Vives, we would be lucky if we
even have 2-2-2.

231
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:23,410
we'd be at and then but most likely we might have four
supports and then it's tyler one and moxie cool wait who i

232
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:26,050
don't know who these people okay um

233
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:42,450
um who okay i'm gonna see who these people are and what they
play okay i finally i found the spot where um where they i

234
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:51,970
can actually see my teammates now yeah i need i'm gonna
check there's a rank check thing here okay we have a two

235
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:59,810
supports okay um oh okay we have another tank player
technically this other guy also plays support but like he's

236
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:10,390
like or tank or take okay we just need tyler one to not pick
another support and then we should be good we should be If

237
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:18,110
all else fails, we can always play triple support or we play
triple support or we play triple support One of them only

238
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:25,370
has 13 hours played, but that's okay Most likely it's either
me or me playing Deadpool most likely

239
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:40,290
Okay, either he picks a third support or Actually, I play a
few of their support actually might be the plan actually, it

240
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:41,530
actually might be a play, guys.

241
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,770
Plaking a third support.

242
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:46,770
Who is?

243
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,570
Okay, they do have a, okay.

244
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:54,990
Oh, they have it.

245
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:57,830
Wait, E-Rob's team is actually stacked.

246
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:06,010
Because E-Rob's team has space and apparently a one above
all DPS player.

247
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:17,290
So, like, that's a little but they do have three oh they
have three supports though all

248
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:25,030
right who else is left

249
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:49,010
but who's left all right I believe I believe in the vibes I
believe in the vibes guys we can do this off of vibes alone

250
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:59,240
There's still two, four, six more players to go.

251
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:13,660
Where is Amalie, like, on the board twice?

252
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,240
Because her name isn't removed.

253
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:20,100
But it says, like, it says she's, like, on XQC's team.

254
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,360
But her name isn't removed from the board.

255
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,080
So I'm confused.

256
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,920
Yeah, like, I think they put her twice.

257
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:42,800
on the board because it's like because she's still on like
oh wait sorry I'm sorry for not dancing for you guys I'm so

258
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:59,140
sorry don't worry cheek to cheek wait cheek to cheek there
we go alright now I can go back yeah no I just think I'm

259
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:06,260
pretty sure like she's on it twice okay Because that...

260
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,380
Wait, actually, here.

261
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,020
That's a better perspective.

262
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,320
I'll tab out.

263
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:13,880
Yeah.

264
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,960
I was gonna say...

265
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,140
Who's gonna be our sixth player?

266
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,440
Our sixth player is gonna definitely be a support player.

267
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,400
Looking at this.

268
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,540
Yeah, our last...

269
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,720
The last three.

270
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,740
And then...

271
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,660
Yeah!

272
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,060
Moxie just messaged me.

273
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,020
He's like, fucking god!

274
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,320
Yeah!

275
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:47,660
As long as no one target bends, Tyler, we should be good.

276
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,320
There we go.

277
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,320
Who's gonna be our sixth guy?

278
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,360
Yeah!

279
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,000
I told him.

280
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,280
Oh, Moxie was...

281
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:10,760
Oh!

282
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,680
Oh, Moxie was the one that told him to pick me!

283
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,120
Oh, that's sweet.

284
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,700
Yeah, Moxie messaged me.

285
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,200
He's like, I told him.

286
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,740
I told him to pick me.

287
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,120
Yeah!

288
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,780
Alright, everyone's picked.

289
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,340
Our goat.

He's got our backs.

291
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,780
And before we lose every game.

292
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,140

And then if that gets banned, I play Groot.

313
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,450
That is all I can do.

314
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:39,730
That's good.

315
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:43,190

00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:33,730
Okay.

326
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:34,090
All right.

327
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:35,830
So he doesn't need your help

328
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:41,150
He's a strong independent man.

329
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,170
Okay, so I got it downloaded and what do I do?

330
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,550
And then that has a browser source voice.

331
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:48,170
Yeah

332
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,520
Yeah, I think we actually have a fucking good shot.

333
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,180
No cap guys.

334
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,340
I like this.

335
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,160
I think we do too.

336
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,800
I think some people definitely fuck control the draft.

337
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:07,640
Ruffle waffles.

338
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,360
What do you play man?

339
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,160
If you don't mind me asking.

340
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,360
Yeah, no worries.

341
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:15,080
I, in the last tournament I was support because I had like
10 hours in the game.

342
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,720
In the last two days, I've been learning DPS.

343
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:22,480
So I can play Squirrel Girl, Heller, No More.

344
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,640
I'm pretty good with No More.

345
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:30,120
uh if you force me onto bucky i can play bucky but i'm less
consistent with bucky so i'd say no more is probably a

346
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:41,380
better option i can moon night and then i can also flex onto
rocket or uh lunar if you need me to but probably would

347
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:48,440
prefer dps but i can i can do whatever you guys think would
be best for the team guys fire fire i like that i like that

348
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:56,200
team player i like that somebody help me okay so maybe you
should use Moxie's thing that he provided.

349
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:01,240
Okay, you see the thing in the Tyler one chat?

350
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,420
You just copy that and add it as a source.

351
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,240
That entire link?

352
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:10,840
Yeah, yeah, you add it as a source and then you should be
good as a browser source.

353
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,380
And it's the URL.

354
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,040
Oh, it works!

355
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:14,520
Yay!

356
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,300
Are we all supposed to do that?

357
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,440
Are you trolling me, Doki?

358
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,460

look wait don't you what do you play I play support so I can

370
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:50,560
I can flex any other supports I feel like we might I need a
Deadpool support or a tank Deadpool because Deadpool that uh

371
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:59,200
I haven't really watched too much good at support or tank so
it depends on who either the tank player plays it or the

372
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:08,260
support player plays it i have no time on deadpool okay you
had early access just like me zero time you wasn't giving it

373
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:18,840
a shot i saw you on deadpool for a minute okay so i guess
i'm on deadpool okay unless tyler do you want to do you want

374
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:27,000
to play deadpool okay i'm actually playing the win it's
actually Okay, I'm going to the middle or I'm going to the

375
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,820
group guy.

376
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,640
But you could be a prodigy on Deadpool.

377
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,160
You don't know that until you try.

378
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:31,860
Oh, I'm not first-timing.

379
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:32,880
Stop rage-baiting me.

380
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,740
You don't fucking listen.

381
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,620
Guys, we didn't sound like that.

382
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,120
You need to listen.

383
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:38,780
Okay?

384
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,640
I don't like people to fucking listen.

385
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:42,440
Hear me?

386
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,060
Okay, let's go.

387
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,640
Okay, I'm playing Deadpool.

388
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:46,980
I'm playing Deadpool.

389
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:50,440
Okay, guys.

390
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,620
I guess I'm on Deadpool, guys.

391
00:34:54,400 --> 00:35:02,840
these guys are fucked uh so not us like i'm looking at our i
mean based on what we said we had am i tank i followed him

392
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:09,000
as well i don't know if sound guy is here i might be tank i
don't know i saw you play gambit and tank dude you're the

393
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,900
goat you got this i mean you play tank right i like our team
yeah i do i put in for i've been playing support more

394
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:20,100
recently but uh i can play any tank and i could play pretty
much any i literally if we need anything i can play a

395
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,820
perfect slot you're perfect slot.

396
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,640
I mean, we could play Loki.

397
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,440
Gambit, Loki, and Deadpool.

398
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,500
That should be fine.

399
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,980
That would abuse people in this badly.

400
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:34,240
Like, the people who don't play this game often, if we found
a way to play that well.

401
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,360
Loki plays Loki, right?

402
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:41,620
Yeah, but we need a Deadpool, and apparently it's either me
or someone else.

403
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,860
Wait, do we actually have to have a Deadpool?

404
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:43,580
Is that what we have to do?

405
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,400
Yeah, because it's the Deadpool turn.

406
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,440
I didn't see that in the rules.

407
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,040
Am I tweeting?

408
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,860
I figured that might be the case.

409
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:58,560
but I have no time on them either so did I learn them right
now yeah you might as like why don't we get like a ruffle

410
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:05,760
waffles on them on Deadpool okay so okay I'll give you a
quick rundown don't worry I'm just as confused as you okay

411
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:11,800
so here's the first tip you go to settings I don't know I
think looks pretty good you go no you go on settings and

412
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:19,560
then you go a keyboard and then go all heroes change it to
Deadpool or like Deadpool support you scroll down it says to

413
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:26,280
hero and it says to pick Deadpool support yeah yeah okay and
then you scroll down you click on here you see hero Deadpool

414
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:32,820
style ability description turn that shit off so you can
actually understand what your abilities are I'll turn it off

415
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:43,620
and anything else anything else I got it off just read just
read I can't do that oh god just read your abilities okay he

416
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:50,220
just yaps the whole game doesn't he oh my my first time i
i've i've like intentionally not watched any um guys they're

417
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:56,860
actually asking everybody to leave their games now so that
you can invite okay how am i supposed to learn deadpool yeah

418
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:03,000
i guess you just can't oh well if i'm out of the game good
luck to what wait who are we fighting bro yeah there's only

419
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,620
no there's only four people in here you can go in the
practice range while you're in the lobby yeah yeah yeah yeah

420
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:15,400
yeah sure sure sure sure we're playing against necros first
okay wait let me let me see what they have i don't know

421
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:21,340
necros is good necros is really good he just plays the most
annoying characters like i think there's people that are

422
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:27,580
probably just as good as him in here but he just i believe
he plays people that are so obnoxious you can dip him yeah

423
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:37,620
just play bucky and then hook him uh why is a ruffle hunter
pink i'm in the uk brother oh my god why did anybody tell me

424
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:43,480
that you picked me you should have regents next to him next
to the list

425
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,100
Oh.

I've zero hours on Deadpool, so...

435
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:05,130
Well, someone's trying Deadpool.

436
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,870
If we actually have to have one, then it might be worth it.

437
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:08,410
I did.

438
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,670
We have to have one, I'm pretty sure.

439
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:11,230
What up, Morrison?

440
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:12,390

446
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:50,490
could it'll probably get banned they'll probably someone
someone on every like they're gonna ban it damn it at least

447
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:58,270
that's funny though the Deadpool invitational and Deadpool's
not required yeah that's I thought there was a chance and

448
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:10,630
then no one plays Deadpool I don't know because probably
support just because it seems like mr.

449
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:16,530
raffle waffle said he pretty much has all his time in DPS
and Doki's in support.

450
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:17,350
And some support.

451
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:18,830
And some support.

452
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:19,310
You're right.

453
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:25,270
We could run a triple and then we could do double tank and
Moxie could be our solo DPS if you want to do that.

454
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:31,270
I'm going to write my heroes in our team chat so that you
can like refer to those in case you want to make some calls

455
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:32,390
on what you want to play.

456
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:35,770
Alright, Moxie, you go cook the comp.

457
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:37,730
Yeah, I'm trying to see here, dude.

458
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:39,570
I definitely want Tyler on the venom or the grude.

459
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:40,570
He's that guy.

460
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,070
He could go dive.

461
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:45,030
I'm playing Hawkeye.

462
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:45,710
I don't know.

463
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:47,030
Okay, we don't go dab.

464
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:50,690
I feel like I could cook on that the most.

465
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:52,030
Okay.

466
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:53,530
I like that.

467
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:56,470
But I could flex as well.

468
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:57,870
What?

469
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:00,030
I forgot these bands right now.

470
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:03,010
Fan Fan only plays Cloak, but I feel like I kind of want her
on Cloak.

471
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:09,010
I mean, the thing is we need a mag if she's going to be on
Cloak because then they'll just, they just get free Cloak

472
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:09,250
all.

473
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:10,950
True, true.

474
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:13,170
Or you can headshot here, I guess.

475
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:19,890
yeah he's on hawk guy yeah true i mean but then she might
just run into a cubby hole or some i can do mag for us every

476
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:28,690
game if uh if tyler's on uh grude or even or venom yeah my
ag will help be good because then that just fully counters

477
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:37,590
cloak and if all else fails we can go triple support

478
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:56,020
wow i like this i like this guys i'm feeling good i'm
serious it's round robin too so it's like and these are all

00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:26,710
time on rocket and you got some time on mantis some oh that
was yeah that was that was a long time ago that's okay it's

489
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:33,450
like riding a bicycle mantis i should not play but rocket
rocket i can definitely play like the one I'm least

490
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:39,070
consistent on definitely out of that list is Bucky but
everyone else there I'm like I I know how to play them kind

491
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:49,790
of thing yeah yeah I was like what the fuck was that yeah
also we're they're missing a player yeah Ruffle if you don't

492
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:55,710
mind me asking what game do you come from I call it call of
jury call of jury oh then it works oh he's gonna be an aamer

493
00:42:55,710 --> 00:43:04,390
yeah but well call of jury zombies so I'm PVE he's not a
namer he's not Deadpool wait for him your main game is Call

494
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:13,010
of Duty zombies that pays the bills that pays the but it
does it does pay the bills I was what's the best which was

495
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:24,190
the best uh zombies game no we're no we're not going that my
chance was not screaming you don't have a you don't have a

496
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:33,990
thought what you think about a lot of zombies yeah there
have been like 20 at this point it's definitely best one

497
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:40,850
yeah what do you think the most time in black ops 3 okay
black ops 3 that's a that's a i think that's a standard yeah

498
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:49,270
we're now on black ops 7 so it's like they've played it out
a bit is the zombies in black ops 7 good uh it's all right

499
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:55,950
i've not played it yeah that's the same for most people to
be honest the game is sold really badly this year so

500
00:43:55,950 --> 00:44:04,270
everyone stopped all right stopped watching right now okay
go down a little records no i'm not like a i i do the guides

501
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:10,090
up a little that's if you've ever done an easter egg in cod
zombies you've probably used my guide for it all right and

502
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:23,670
then uh moxie down a little same with waffle okay moxie yeah
i'm the guy from tutorials yeah all right let me know if

503
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:28,790
it's better i've definitely seen your name so i've probably
watched multiple videos like almost no realize it's better

504
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:40,070
cool yeah well i hope to live up to the name as oh you will
whatever reputation has preceded me uh click some heads yeah

505
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:48,070
absolutely if we i do think if we're trying i guess we
should probably work on what we want to play but i do think

506
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:57,270
if we're trying to play like gambit loki then i probably
will have to be on I'm also thinking about banning Loki.

507
00:44:57,590 --> 00:45:00,130
This the Rob CD guy only plays it.

508
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:04,690
Oh, okay Then we could just wait, but is he good at is he
good at Loki though?

509
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:06,110
He's level eight.

510
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:12,390
Okay, so are you like it's the only character he knows like
he's probably gonna be even worse That's true.

511
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:13,790
I mean, that is true.

512
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:16,930
Yeah, that's wait, don't you play you play all support.

513
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:18,510
Yeah, I play all support Okay, also okay, perfect.

514
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:26,990
You know what last time I joined and I only played venom and
they banned it and we literally lost instantly after I think

515
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:28,270
banning noobs is OP.

516
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:29,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

517
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:30,330
I remember that.

518
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:31,350
It's like PTSD.

519
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:32,070
Sure, sure.

520
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:33,170
Lock it, lock the fucking lock.

521
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:33,650
Lock it in.

522
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:36,070
Wait, but Moxie has to figure out bans though.

523
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:37,230
He's on bans for us.

524
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:38,510
I don't even see it.

525
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:39,770
Oh yeah, who is it?

526
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:41,190
Oh, it's me.

527
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:41,930
Okay, okay.

528
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:42,270
That's good.

529
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:42,670
That's good.

530
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:43,370
That's good.

531
00:45:43,370 --> 00:45:43,910
See him, baby.

532
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:44,890
Okay.

533
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:48,570
What if they target ban you, Tyler?

534
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:50,350
They could.

535
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:51,410
But he's got a group.

536
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:52,450
He's got a group too.

537
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:54,310
I don't think that's how it works.

538
00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:54,950
Wait.

539
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:55,530
We can ban.

540
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:56,590
Wait wait, I hope he don't ban me.

541
00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:58,490
Wait, wait, we can protect Venom.

542
00:45:58,710 --> 00:45:59,350
Yeah, we can protect them.

543
00:45:59,350 --> 00:45:59,650
Yeah, yeah.

544
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:03,390
He said he can play you, how good are you at GRUT, Tyler?

545
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:04,350
GRUT's about the same.

546
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:04,970
The same skill.

547
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:09,030
Because GRUT's like a top tank, and he's like the best.

548
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:10,470
Okay, well, I like Venom.

549
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:13,190
Yeah, you play Venom, God damn it.

550
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:14,830
Oh, the lucky Ben.

551
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:16,550
We just absolutely banned their noob.

552
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:18,990
Oh, yeah, we did.

553
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:21,650
We did ban Hawkeye.

554
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:22,910
We should say for you, right?

555
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:23,930
Yeah, Venom.

556
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:24,750
Yeah, whatever you want to play.

557
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:26,110
We're safe.

558
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:26,770
Yeah, we're safe.

559
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:29,730
I'm not.

560
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:30,870
We're not getting a repeat.

561
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:35,510
You're right.

562
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:38,090
And they've been in the Hawkeye, so that kind of sinks.

563
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:39,530
I'm sorry, we have mags.

564
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:42,290
Like we can just mag, play mag.

565
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:45,350
They're going to protect it like crazy, though.

566
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:46,490
They're going to tell her to like come back.

567
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:48,410
What's your second bad, Moxie?

568
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:49,810
I don't know.

569
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:53,830
I'm thinking who like Hawkeye is.

570
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:54,290
Spider-Man.

571
00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:56,390
Spider-Man.

572
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:58,070
I don't think he's going to play Spider-Man.

573
00:46:58,270 --> 00:46:58,670
He's not?

574
00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:00,790
I mean, he probably is going to play Deadpool.

575
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:04,890
Yeah, he's probably going to play Deadpool or DPS Deadpool
or like...

576
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:05,510
Daredevil.

577
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:06,230
It's up to you.

578
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:07,130
Or Deadpool.

579
00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:07,570
I don't care.

580
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:09,030
Oh, shit.

581
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:09,410
Whatever.

582
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:10,210
No, that's something.

583
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:10,950
It's more than nothing.

584
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:13,090
And then we bang Tank Deadpool.

585
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:16,070
Thing is, I could play Spider-Man, too.

586
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:16,850
Kind of.

587
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:19,010
Yeah, senior Spider-Man.

588
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:20,930
Oh, we did just bang Tank Deadpool.

589
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:24,070
Yeah, I mean, I see he plays Tank Deadpool.

590
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:24,610
Okay.

591
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:25,070
Okay.

592
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:35,290
why are you protecting oh protect your own dps whoever you
want to play shit yep okay that's good i think this can peel

593
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:39,950
i can definitely peel yeah huh

594
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:52,870
i mean we want a kid um i don't know what they play that's
the biggest problem like bogey i mean should we ban strange

595
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:58,990
is that crazy he's like probably gonna be really good right
now yeah but he's like isn't he like uh like he loves

596
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:04,970
strange and strange has got a huge buff it's on i don't know
if he's like been playing them or not but i feel like he'd

597
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:09,270
be the type of person that's like dr strange is back and
like a hundred youtube videos and is like he's gonna do

598
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:15,090
he'll do a portal though and i hate dealing with that
against like uh but we ban strange we don't get strange or

599
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:28,250
daredevil oh daredevil actually he's not that strong though
it's just been rob birru strange but i we're yeah maybe i

600
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:32,950
should have been strange too we got buffed okay that's what
i'm feeling like he's gonna be like the strange we have

601
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:44,610
gambit uh we can do gambit in this okay ruffle waffle yep
shall i i could no more or moon knight for the alt synergy

602
00:48:44,610 --> 00:48:53,810

okay uh do you they saved i could do mag i'm gonna fuck up

603
00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:59,770
their healers i was gonna say the only thing we have to
worry about is the cloak up the then yeah because we don't

604
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:08,450
have a mag to count into cloak up okay dude i can do mag uh
guys i'm gonna be pure disruptive i love that you do that

605
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:14,490

guys just paying okay uh like a hundred something i'm pretty

606
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:24,810

on this game or not sort of game one baby showtime this is

607
00:49:24,810 --> 00:49:32,230
what we get paid the big bucks Moxie, if you hook their
cloak out of old at the end of something, I'll try to focus

608
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:33,210
over there.

609
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:38,050
By the way, those who don't know what Gambit ult does, when
Doki has an ult...

610
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:39,130
We don't heal, though, anymore.

611
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:39,770
Oh, listen, we run.

612
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:40,530
Oh, we don't.

613
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:41,090
We don't understand.

614
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:41,530
I don't...

615
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:43,010
I think they got rid of self-heal, right?

616
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:44,790
Yeah, but like everyone...

617
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:46,070
Everyone stand in front of...

618
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:46,270
Shako!

619
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:48,650
Moxie, it's up to you!

620
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:49,550
You're in front when we're doing it.

621
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:49,810
Oh, God.

622
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:51,210
It's Doki Shako helped do it.

623
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:52,110
Well, okay, okay.

624
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:53,230
Where are we going?

625
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:55,010
Okay, we're going to point.

626
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:55,630
We're going to point.

627
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:56,750
For me, I'll...

628
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:57,410
They use the portal.

629
00:49:58,130 --> 00:49:58,710
No, Ty, look out.

630
00:49:58,750 --> 00:49:59,010
Over here.

631
00:49:59,030 --> 00:49:59,290
Over here.

632
00:49:59,370 --> 00:49:59,850
Come main.

633

They portal on.

635
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:03,570
They're going to portal on.

636
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:04,210
They're going forward.

637
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:04,630
Yeah.

638
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:06,110
I'm going for the healers.

639
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:07,470
Go, Tyler.

640
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:08,190
I'm going.

641
00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:14,030

Oh, that's unlucky.

655
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:37,430
The backline's low!

656
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:37,850
They're low?

657
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:40,010

Let me farm.

750
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:30,590
Yeah.

751
00:54:31,150 --> 00:54:31,910
Let Doki go.

752
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:32,250
Let Doki.

753
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:32,650

00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:34,130
Oh, no.

00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:34,690
I'll try.

759
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:36,770
Farmer here as much as you can.

760
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:38,250
Just shoot down the clock plane and do everything.

761
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:39,330
Because if you get it, we just win.

762
00:54:39,970 --> 00:54:44,030
Let me farm the, let me farm my ult here.

763
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:45,670
Yeah, try not to heal too much unless we're going to die,
Epoch.

764
00:54:46,310 --> 00:54:46,810
Back up.

765
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:48,030
We're okay.

766
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:49,470
Just keep getting your ult, Rob, when we win.

767
00:54:49,610 --> 00:54:50,050
If you get it.

768
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:50,670
Yeah.

769
00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:51,150
Use your ult.

770
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:54,630
I don't marry your ult of another support ult or use it
defensively.

771
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:55,690
Yeah.

772
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:56,970
Whatever you get it, just let me know.

773
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:57,870
I know you're close.

774
00:54:58,910 --> 00:54:59,490
Does that make sense?

775
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:00,090
I can't.

776
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:09,270
Oh Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa Use it, use it, use it, use it,
use it Oh, that's a What happened?

777
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:16,710
I quoted, we have to use the invis If you hear the sound
cue, you just use it It's fine, it's fine We have to, can we

778
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:17,090
portal?

779
00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:28,090
Oh, they're counter portaling Yeah, never mind, never mind
Nice team, Moxie, nice try Nice try, I try, what?

780
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:29,110
Nice team, Moxie?

Okay, it's fine.

782
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:33,490
Yeah, this is okay.

783
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:39,230
So like when you hear the sound cue, just throw the
invisible out there.

784
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:40,350
The Deadpool sound cue?

785
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:42,810
No, the, no, not the Deadpool, just strange.

786
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:45,170
Cause he had, uh, we had time to throw it.

787
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:46,090
I know that one's tough too.

788
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:48,170
That one's like the toughest one of the harder ones to do.

789
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:49,030
Or just push it.

790
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:50,330
Just have a push up.

791
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:52,950
Uh, you want to play?

792
00:55:53,110 --> 00:55:54,430
We could do Groot Mag.

793
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:57,650
It's like, like, do you feel like you're doing better on
Venom or what?

794
00:55:57,790 --> 00:55:58,350
I think I think.

795
00:55:58,370 --> 00:55:58,910
I just want to win.

796
00:55:58,910 --> 00:56:00,110
Yeah, it's up to you.

797
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:02,270
Yeah, I think get Tyler on group.

798
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:02,990
Get Tyler on group.

799
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:04,250
Yeah, they're going to have a better champ.

800
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:07,910
Go mag and then just counter the cloak with mag out.

801
00:56:08,350 --> 00:56:08,870
Yeah, I can.

802
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:11,690
Do you rather that or I should do that over Punisher,
honestly?

803
00:56:11,890 --> 00:56:12,410
Yeah, swap group.

804
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,030
I'll go first.

805
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:16,630
I'll go first.

806
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,310
And then we'll just try one first fight.

807
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:21,990
He's, what's his name?

808
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:22,910
Hard to deal with back there?

809
00:56:23,190 --> 00:56:25,690
Like the, uh, whatever.

810
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:26,830
I don't think I should just go.

811
00:56:26,990 --> 00:56:27,910
I might just go storm.

812
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:30,730
Who is?

813
00:56:30,770 --> 00:56:31,470
I don't know.

814
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:32,830
Um, thanks.

815
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:34,830
Okay, so here's my walls.

816
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:36,970
Alright, I'm gonna, I'm gonna alt early, okay?

817
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:38,510
We're gonna go all the way down below.

818
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:40,610
Basically your shift makes it so you do damage.

819
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:42,170
Three, three, two, one.

820
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:42,550

Watch out, go, go, go.

pull for that only the entire game and just pull or push uh

834
00:57:28,170 --> 00:57:36,030
angela off every time I know it's hard I clean it but it is
like one of the counters and it's such a ridiculously far

Go, go, go.

859
00:58:58,490 --> 00:58:59,470
Counter this if you can.

Punish it, Dad.

861
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:02,290
There's no way I can.

862
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:02,730
Find the cloak.

863
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:03,250
Find the cloak.

864
00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:04,230
We can have a ammo.

865
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:07,010
Nice.

866
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:08,050
They're down two.

867
00:59:08,130 --> 00:59:08,470
They're down two.

868
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:08,870
They're down two.

869
00:59:08,930 --> 00:59:09,010
Yeah, yeah.

870
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:09,430
We win this.

871
00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:10,330
We should win this.

872
00:59:11,210 --> 00:59:12,030
Careful of a punter.

873
00:59:12,430 --> 00:59:13,190
Careful of Angela.

874
00:59:13,610 --> 00:59:13,730
Yeah, yeah.

875
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:15,550
Save the push for Angela.

876
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:18,710
Okay.

877
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:20,710
We got cloak.

878
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:21,850
Angela, focus on Angela.

879
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:22,810
Angela one.

880
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:23,530
Got her.

881
00:59:23,890 --> 00:59:24,550
All right.

882
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:25,010
Nice.

883
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,330
Did you tap it?

884
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:29,150
Yeah, we did.

885
00:59:29,290 --> 00:59:29,390
Yeah.

886
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:32,250
So save your, just make sure you save your pull and push for
Angela.

887
00:59:32,430 --> 00:59:33,510
Just don't push anything else.

888
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:34,770
I got someone's on.

889
00:59:34,770 --> 00:59:35,170
You can.

890
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:35,990
I'm going on dead.

891
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:42,670
okay probably you can play like a weird angle and try to
honk and just like deal with supports like earlier okay

900
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:13,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

901
01:00:14,470 --> 01:00:15,210

01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:17,930
It's fine.

905
01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:23,130

Yeah, close, close.

910
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:28,590
That's the same point.

911
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:29,470
Oh, I'm probably dead.

912
01:00:29,610 --> 01:00:29,730

913
01:00:30,690 --> 01:00:33,850

918
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:53,010

they're coming you are saying yeah we have to touch keep

919
01:00:53,010 --> 01:01:00,770
fighting until we have a winner i feel it oh yeah hold on my
go first care nice we have all here

920
01:01:04,770 --> 01:01:17,370
come on i got a pleasure no we see nine oh i got grabbed and
kicked off my man which five low key that's the most fucked

921
01:01:17,370 --> 01:01:24,570
ass map for them they have all good for them bro could it
swing I got ace though you did get ace

922
01:01:28,050 --> 01:01:35,230
yeah everything could be caught to the lava yeah that's the
only like map in the game they can like run this cheesy ass

923
01:01:35,230 --> 01:01:44,750
shit I think if they run Angela I can I can play in this for
us because i'm more used i'm i'm i'm more like muscle change

924
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:55,650
very pushes yeah it's all right it's just round robin so
it's like damage dokey you kidding me what okay look i was

925
01:01:55,650 --> 01:02:04,250
healing are you kidding me i was 23k healing though epic bro
are you kidding me yeah four final hits yeah tyler did more

926
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:14,250
damage than you dokey um i have four final hits final hits
than tyler guys honestly i feel like low key we're getting

927
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:21,290
the groove i think we're disrupting figuring it out a quick
warm-up game bro that was tough yeah the whole thing is so

928
01:02:21,290 --> 01:02:27,370
huge and it's just so tough uh yeah you're not like used to
it like she just gets she just i mean dude i was pulled off

929
01:02:27,370 --> 01:02:37,030
the map three different times from as far right as i could
possibly be on like the against the wall basically and we're

930
01:02:37,030 --> 01:02:42,350
just trying to figure out our comps right now anyway Yeah,
100%.

931
01:02:42,350 --> 01:02:43,990
We could try triple support.

932
01:02:44,350 --> 01:02:45,590
Like, what do we plan next?

933
01:02:45,830 --> 01:02:48,070
We just do round robin against all the teams.

934
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:50,210
So we play four more best of ones against everyone.

935
01:02:50,650 --> 01:02:54,350
But honestly, like, I mean, it doesn't really matter how we
do.

936
01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:57,230
I feel like we are on paper one of the stronger teams.

937
01:02:57,530 --> 01:03:01,670
So like we could win like even with a- It doesn't matter how
we do.

938
01:03:02,770 --> 01:03:06,990
Well, I'm saying even if we do bad, even if we do bad, which
I don't think we will in the rest of the game.

939
01:03:06,990 --> 01:03:08,510
So what does it matter if we win or lose these games?

940
01:03:09,070 --> 01:03:09,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

941
01:03:09,770 --> 01:03:18,110
we do underdog you know it's an underdog run yeah guys i
don't know the format of this i don't it's it's gonna be

942
01:03:18,110 --> 01:03:24,830
like our record at the end of the five games that we play is
how you how they seed us so if we have a good record we

943
01:03:24,830 --> 01:03:29,890
basically guarantee play a team that like did really bad
like if we were to get top two we'd play against five or six

944
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:35,410
probably and then if we were to knock them out we'd
guarantee get top three four so we automatically make 20

945
01:03:35,410 --> 01:03:36,210
grand instead of 10.

946
01:03:38,710 --> 01:03:45,030
gotcha i think that's how that works check check after we
win it all does anybody want to play rock paper scissors for

947
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:57,270
their split hmm rock paper scissors for their split yep okay
i'm gonna adjust oh i am way too broke to be gambling like

948
01:03:57,270 --> 01:04:10,230
that g all right um i up well a bit um i okay i brought
moxie down a little bit it's tough though because oh oh wait

949
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:19,930
they whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa wait they add on ping to us by
the way yeah i see that i don't know what that means that

950
01:04:19,930 --> 01:04:27,530
means they have people with 150 ping or 140 ping and they're
like you know what it's unfair they're too low ping we have

951
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:33,650
to add on lag to them wow this is a dallas server bro that's
actually messed up i'd be flying bro you would be flying bro

952
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:42,090
i play on like nine ping or less every game what the does
anyone does anyone think that's crazy artificial ping that

953
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:48,330
is i mean i think we put in a formal complaint i think we uh
balance latency that's i think of the majority necros is a

954
01:04:48,330 --> 01:04:56,790
billionaire and he i think if the majority is na they should
tank it i'm with you i'm with you they should tank it why

955
01:04:56,790 --> 01:05:04,570
give equality to them i'm saying he's a billionaire he could
he could literally put a house in in texas and just move for

956
01:05:04,570 --> 01:05:09,730
this turn i did not realize official thing that's crazy yeah
that's what i just figured out right now where are we

957
01:05:09,730 --> 01:05:14,890
playing next that's what it was either because then we can
figure out bands really screw i don't know who we're playing

958
01:05:14,890 --> 01:05:24,650
next is that anywhere usually there's like a there's like a
sheet like a bingo board almost looking thing think xqc next

959
01:05:24,650 --> 01:05:32,030
where do you see that well uh we band grew if you go general
and then scroll up a little what man tyler you ever played

960
01:05:32,030 --> 01:05:38,490
thing oh i see no i tried it last time he's Oh, I was in
their backline on the healers.

961
01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:39,570
No, no, you did good.

962
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:40,570
I'm just saying.

963
01:05:41,010 --> 01:05:41,830
Thing would be good.

964
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:43,630
Theoretically into that comp.

965
01:05:43,790 --> 01:05:44,410
It would have just been good.

966
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:49,870
We got solid healers, so you're going to get healed.

967
01:05:50,350 --> 01:05:51,330
Tell me one bit wrong, guys.

968
01:05:51,970 --> 01:05:52,530
Be honest.

969
01:05:53,670 --> 01:05:54,190
I'll be honest.

970
01:05:54,430 --> 01:05:57,130
I legit think we win if it's any other map.

971
01:05:57,510 --> 01:06:04,010
Hellshaven is the one thing that has all those pits and
shit, which they play those characters that are cheesy.

972
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:05,590
I'm having a good Angela.

973
01:06:06,030 --> 01:06:12,750
messing up so bad no it was the strange alts too like we
that too yeah we had just had to push to strange or have a

974
01:06:12,750 --> 01:06:19,930
defensive off for the strange yeah i understand strange now
i'll be bad i'm ready i'm ready for the old system let's go

975
01:06:19,930 --> 01:06:26,290
that's true you're locked he's locked in because like it was
literally we lost if you guys want me to hold because i

976
01:06:26,290 --> 01:06:32,030
already have like 10 hours on this game just yeah yeah i'll
try to use it myself yeah the worst thing is that it's just

977
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:38,250
so fast like things come so like the strange old you have
like one second to react yeah that's like my bad because

978
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:43,810
like i think you were cooking epic i'm not gonna lie yeah i
think you're fine there's like no you're seriously fine just

979
01:06:43,810 --> 01:06:50,510
like if if i guess like when they engage if they engage with
the defensive alt just mirror alt it or if they use like an

980
01:06:50,510 --> 01:06:58,490
offensive alt just i'll just rip it honestly send it i'll
just send it yeah yeah even if you feel threatened just just

981
01:06:58,490 --> 01:07:07,210
all as well just yeah like we'll tell you before like the
dps characters you should like watch out for specifically to

982
01:07:07,210 --> 01:07:11,570
all four so if you hear their voice line just go but see i
don't really know the voice lines like i can kind of figure

983
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:18,630
it out but like i don't really know the voice lines like
that no i got you have you ever played gambit or no no okay

984
01:07:18,630 --> 01:07:24,710
um wait why are supports do you play i have loki hella
Invis.

985
01:07:25,430 --> 01:07:25,790
Invis.

986
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:26,830
Oh, not Loki.

987
01:07:26,970 --> 01:07:27,430
Not Loki.

988
01:07:27,590 --> 01:07:28,050
Not Loki.

989
01:07:28,410 --> 01:07:28,870
Just Invis.

990
01:07:29,230 --> 01:07:29,490
Okay.

991
01:07:29,970 --> 01:07:31,210
Bro, that's a good three.

992
01:07:31,370 --> 01:07:31,750
I'm not gonna lie.

993
01:07:32,010 --> 01:07:32,550
That's a really good three.

994
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:33,210
That's a core three.

995
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:35,030
I think you'd be really, really good at Luna.

996
01:07:35,210 --> 01:07:35,810
You're an aimer.

997
01:07:36,290 --> 01:07:37,410
Like, I could do Luna.

998
01:07:37,690 --> 01:07:39,010
I think you'd be fine with him on Luna.

999
01:07:39,770 --> 01:07:40,030
Yeah.

1000
01:07:41,870 --> 01:07:45,170
Because the alts for her is more reflex too.

1001
01:07:45,310 --> 01:07:45,570
Yeah, yeah.

1002
01:07:45,690 --> 01:07:47,470
So that you don't have to like place it anywhere.

1003
01:07:48,070 --> 01:07:48,350
Yeah.

1004
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:52,980
Well, you really got no time.

1005
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:54,960
You actually only have time on those three.

1006
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:56,820
Yes, literally.

1007
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:58,720
That's a good three.

1008
01:07:59,180 --> 01:08:00,080
That's a really solid three.

1009
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:01,740
I have, like, friends who are, like, good.

1010
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:03,580
And I told them, I was like, bro, I got two days.

1011
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:06,780
I lowered Moxie a little bit again.

1012
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:08,820
So, like, they just gave me those.

1013
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:11,780
Moxie, figure out the bans for XQC's team.

1014
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:12,640
Okay.

1015
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:13,220
All right.

1016
01:08:14,580 --> 01:08:15,620
Who did they play last?

1017
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:17,040
Let's see who they played last match.

1018
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:18,260
I'll try to pull it up as well.

1019
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:21,360
All right.

1020
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:26,040
They have XQC, Aimbot, Calvin, Warren, Sweden.

1021
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:35,720
I know like it plays a mean rocket I mean could just ban
rocket I don't know if she still does or not she played that

1022
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:42,780
in the last journey I feel like she would just play rocket
if that's like her comfort pick I think she plays Emma and

1023
01:08:42,780 --> 01:08:51,960
Squirrel Girl like she has time on this game so hmm but but
did they put on support that's the thing for her last game

1024
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:56,600
that is that is true if they put on support then she'll just
be playing rocket and then we can just ban Rocket.

1025
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:00,580
I can watch their game right now.

1026
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:01,640
That's what I'm doing.

1027
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:03,340
I need him to pull the scoreboard up real quick.

1028
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:05,260
Let me see their bans.

1029
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:05,700
Oh, I see.

1030
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:11,520
They played solo tank triple support.

1031
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:14,420
We might have to play triple.

1032
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:15,200
Or not, sorry.

1033
01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:17,060
Who's iPhone 8 user?

1034
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:19,760
I don't know.

1035
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:20,700
That's Calvin.

1036
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:21,800
Inbound Calvin.

1037
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:24,580
Because he was on Deadpool.

1038
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:33,340
they had they had yeah he was solo tanking strange like xuc
solo tank strange and then they played rocket like gambit we

1039
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:39,920
could ban both we just ban both of their supports because i
know amali is most comfortable on cloak so we ban cloak and

1040
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:47,240
rocket that leaves if they're running triple support that
gives them less support less supports to uh to play around

1041
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:57,000
with true who is um who's aspen is that dude is that person
of support is it okay yeah yeah yeah So if we just ban

1042
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:02,100
Rocket, I mean, we could literally just do a full support
ban line, too, honestly.

1043
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:04,720
I'd be down for that, because I think those are the
strongest players.

1044
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:07,880
Because if they're going to abuse support, then we just ban
the strongest support.

1045
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:11,080
So we ban Cloak, Rocket.

1046
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:12,420
I mean, they're running Mantis.

1047
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,340
Mantis is fucking strong with Triple.

1048
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:19,200
I just see, I don't know, I see Warn's playing Lord Squirrel
Girl.

1049
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:20,300
Yeah, I'm looking at that as well.

1050
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:20,920
It's a little freaky.

1051
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:21,700
That's why I said who is that?

1052
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,540
Are you scared of Squirrel Girl, Moxie?

1053
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:25,380
No, but it's like...

1054
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:26,920
Lord, I don't know.

1055
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:31,860
If Aspen is, I don't know, is Aspen support main?

1056
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:38,060
Because then they'll have more like pool depth, like hero
pool.

1057
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,280
So it might not be worth just trying to ban out.

1058
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:43,980
Because what I feel like that would be doing is it would be
banning for their worst player.

1059
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:44,500
Right?

1060
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:46,380
Like their least experienced player.

1061
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:49,920
For triple support, Mantis is very strong in triple support.

1062
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:52,480
Because of the damage boost.

1063
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:54,200
And she can just damage boost the Squirrel Grill.

1064
01:10:55,140 --> 01:11:03,120
which would be even did they do that yeah mantis does damage
boost and uh and they can just damage boost their dps player

1065
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:09,120
which is what makes them her super and he uh mantis controls
the temple of the game because her all basically is like a

1066
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:15,880
speed boost and speed boost plus heals gotcha i didn't even
see that they play oh so he did play mantis okay so are we

1067
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:22,720
banning for him or we and just kind of or are we banning for
the worst the two other ones that are like um we're allowed

1068
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:32,780
to do let us do three support ban i would pick first uh
rocket then mantis and then cloak okay because i don't think

1069
01:11:32,780 --> 01:11:40,340
we have to have a uh i guess we could do yeah we could do
the same thing then because i personally don't think they'll

1070
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:46,720
protect mantis but that's just in my i don't think might
actually protect mantis because mantis is very strong this

1071
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:54,360
one guy looks like he's only playing squirrel girl you want
to ban squirrel girl i want to ban cloak in rocket and

1072
01:11:54,360 --> 01:12:01,300
squirrel girl that's how i don't know but i'm down ban in
mantis as well i mean we could substitute we could

1073
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:11,120
substitute the cloak with mantis because i rather ban mantis
than um because because then we have to mirror mantis i play

1074
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:16,340
if we ban mantis or a decent mantis i should say if we ban
mantis immediately does that instantly signal to them that

1075
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:22,820
we're buying the like we're doing support bands no no it
would probably just signal to them that we watched they also

1076
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:33,460
well the enemy the enemy team also banned grout and hella
versus them xuc plays grew right yeah yeah he plays other

1077
01:12:33,460 --> 01:12:41,000
takes too he plays grout and strange okay i think moxie what
are you first banning are you banning first banning rocket

1078
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:47,680
or squirrel girl because they might did they protect
squirrel girl i feel like it depends on the map like some of

1079
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:53,580
shit for squirrel girl but like the day the day protects
squirrel yeah they protected squirrel girl so we'll just

1080
01:12:53,580 --> 01:13:01,120
that was an intentional thing we'll first ban squirrel girl
then is that worn person like uh like do they play the game

1081
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:07,720
like a lot or they just scroll girl man i don't think so
they're an overwatch player overwatch player okay who just

1082
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:13,840
ripped squirrel girl love it just for rivals just for rivals
yeah i mean that could be worth banning that if that's like

1083
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:24,160
their their thing my chat is saying that warn is an he is
okay but the thing is he if he spent most of his time on

1084
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:32,120
squirrel girl then like it's just we're just like capping
him yeah yeah it doesn't really matter okay apparently he he

1085
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:38,880
like mains sniper and overwatch it's okay widow maker isn't
different game yeah i mean you could try widow in this but

1086
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:44,800
we're playing different from widow here yo tyler i don't
like the quietness bro what's happening over there and he

1087
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:50,080
and he comes i'll get my mind right i was saying To my guys,
I am the Hoorah guy.

1088
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:51,140
I'm the Hoorah guy.

1089
01:13:51,220 --> 01:13:52,060
Wait, give us a Hoorah.

1090
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,440
Hoorah starts right before the game.

1091
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:57,580
Not now.

1092
01:13:57,580 --> 01:14:00,320
But what if we need motivation now?

1093
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,040
Because we lost our first game.

1094
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:03,320
We need you to motivate us.

1095
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:04,800
It is what it is.

1096
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:05,880
You guys need to speak up.

1097
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:06,960
There's nobody shot calling.

1098
01:14:07,220 --> 01:14:08,280
There's no one like headless chicken.

1099
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:10,840
Moxie, why aren't you shot calling?

1100
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:11,600
I didn't know what to do.

1101
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:12,080
I'm a nude.

1102
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:13,660
You got to tell me what to do, by the way.

1103
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:15,800
Doki, you see the whole fight from the back.

1104
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:17,060
I'm like trying to shoot my gun.

1105
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:25,180
but you're shoot your gun so you know who's low right right
yeah so you should be tar i'll do shot you do target guys

1106
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:31,760
okay yes okay yeah so you get target color i need you to
step up as well guys we three play this game i was commonly

1107
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:38,280
crazy but i can only kill i'm like guys their luna's one hp
and tyler's like guys their luna is one hp and i killed her

1108
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:46,640
yeah yeah wait are you blaming tyler for doing his job
that's why yeah yeah it was dude their punisher set up the

1109
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:53,500
funniest turrets he'd just be in the middle of like in their
spawn shooting me well he did their punishment had like 20

1110
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:59,220
accuracy so i'm like i kind of felt like the loki ban was
good well we we're protecting tyler right we're just

1111
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:06,840
protecting venom oh do we think they ban his i mean they
might yes no they will this team specifically probably will

1112
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:16,040
ban his because i think moxie remembers because you we were
against you and then you target ben tyler's venom yeah yeah

1113
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:49,220
so he will do it again you know have you uh you haven't
played thing Tyler ever no I played thing no we do not you i

1114
01:15:49,220 --> 01:15:56,500
mean our best protect each game needs to be venom just for
the safety for him to guarantee play it but worse comes to

1115
01:15:56,500 --> 01:16:00,180
worse tyler can always hit a rocket yeah yeah yeah what's

1116
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:10,580
you can you hit the thing then all right so you're you're an
aimer it's so bad about venom what do i do what do i do

1117
01:16:10,580 --> 01:16:17,440
nothing's wrong with the fact that they're gonna ban you i
can't no as long as we oh we did my first bad thing my first

1118
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:27,520
bad him you're right yeah okay we just got protect it's fine
just got protect guys do we ban actually sees grute though

1119
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:34,220
um he'll just play strange then oh and then i would have to
play a hulk or thing okay now we'll get what you're saying

1120
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:38,940
okay wait you want to you want to ban grute i can play emma
if we bang grute or something and just bully their bully x

1121
01:16:38,940 --> 01:16:47,220
if he's a solo tank like loki i think if i'm on hawkeye can
cook yeah yeah yeah yeah like i believe they either banned

1122
01:16:47,220 --> 01:16:54,460
hawkeye or or venom if they first banned venom if they first
banned venom we protect hawkeye okay okay yeah yeah yeah

1123
01:16:54,460 --> 01:17:01,160
because they have to either target you moxie or or tyler so
we have like a plan i feel like you were cooking on the moon

1124
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:07,140
night raffle yeah you were cooking on the moon night i feel
like that just damage is good he's strong right now so one

1125
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:14,240
one thing it all of these round robin games going to be
domination so i could also name more just for squids on

1126
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:19,220
point because he got buffed this patch as well right he did
get buffed right like he's stronger i'll be i'll be honest

1127
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:26,700
name more is pretty mid of a character but like the thing is
he's mid but he doesn't require me to to aim the squid's aim

1128
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:35,320
for me so like there is a there is an inherent buff on auto
aiming squids but i can do either that's fine that's all

1129
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:40,620
good i feel like the damage output in this type of tourney
with a lot of people who don't play the game on moon knight

1130
01:17:40,620 --> 01:17:43,980
could just be overwhelming for people especially in
domination where you're just like shooting in a straight

1131
01:17:43,980 --> 01:17:48,960
line through their whole team fair fair fair plus your old
obviously like if you throw your old on someone who doesn't

1132
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:55,540
play this game that much they're gonna die every time yeah i
guess the the moon knight is gonna just have everyone like

1133
01:17:55,540 --> 01:18:01,480
more generally weaker i guess when playing it at least so if
that means that you can then just get like one hit headshots

1134
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:07,160
because they're already squishy then yeah if you're like if
you're like playing front line and then you occasionally

1135
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:13,300
like take a off angle and just throw an onk behind their
support's feet you'll probably just kill them every time

1136
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:17,980
especially if you know who you're we should like tell we
should look at who their supports are and tell you give you

1137
01:18:17,980 --> 01:18:25,200
a name like go for this person honestly if you ping them
like one time i'll just tunnel them the rest of the game i

1138
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:35,220
mean i'll i'll just say it when we see their comp i'll try
to give you a name yeah that sounds good we can run triple

1139
01:18:35,220 --> 01:18:45,120
support true yes that is the trump card if we if we do run
triple sub am i the one that's flexing to support or is that

1140
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:50,780
someone else probably think it would be you probably yeah
okay okay okay just bear in mind i can only rocket luna

1141
01:18:50,780 --> 01:18:57,980
that's fine that's that's fine support is triple support
doesn't matter what support you play okay okay cool it's

1142
01:18:57,980 --> 01:19:09,280
just mantis is the strong like one Let's go!

1143
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:10,540
Let's go!

1144
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:11,120
Oh, wait.

1145
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:11,860
Their double is good.

1146
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:12,460
I'm not...

1147
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:13,300
Oh, yeah, I could.

1148
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:13,940
Okay.

1149
01:19:17,430 --> 01:19:18,290
I can play thing, guys.

1150
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:19,270
Okay.

1151
01:19:19,870 --> 01:19:22,430
If their comp's, if their comp's like really bad for it, I
think we should.

1152
01:19:22,590 --> 01:19:23,830
Like last game could have been really good.

1153
01:19:24,190 --> 01:19:25,450
But we didn't even think of it.

1154
01:19:25,930 --> 01:19:26,550
Oh, okay.

1155
01:19:26,550 --> 01:19:27,370
Then we can protect Venom.

1156
01:19:28,330 --> 01:19:28,450
Yeah.

1157
01:19:29,790 --> 01:19:30,150
Okay.

1158
01:19:31,290 --> 01:19:32,010
Ben Cloak.

1159
01:19:32,950 --> 01:19:33,310
Not...

1160
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:33,850
Oh, okay, sure.

1161
01:19:34,170 --> 01:19:35,130
Cloak or crap.

1162
01:19:35,350 --> 01:19:35,690
Uh...

1163
01:19:35,690 --> 01:19:36,170
It wasn't not...

1164
01:19:36,170 --> 01:19:36,990
It wasn't not Squirrel Girl.

1165
01:19:37,070 --> 01:19:37,990
Remember, they protected Squirrel Girl.

1166
01:19:38,330 --> 01:19:38,690
Squirrel Girl.

1167
01:19:39,590 --> 01:19:44,070
do do that squirrel girl yeah because they protected
squirrel girl okay we could do we could do support bands

1168
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:50,630
after this though i think yeah yeah so and then protect
venom okay which heroes will get my cosmic favor today

1169
01:19:50,630 --> 01:20:03,300
because if we're not playing mag then minus just ban cloak
we're protecting venom right yeah yep yep venom x's whole

1170
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:10,380
chat spam and ban hawk eye a bunch of snitches bro it's
because he plays with moxie all the time so he knows that's

1171
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:15,920
weird it's weird yeah not cool i thought we're boys i
thought he gets friends he actually doesn't want you to win

1172
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:24,380
this money oh they're actually so stunlocked look how long
you're taking them look at them oh yeah oh they're like what

1173
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:29,420
do we do okay group protected wait this is great for you
though on moon yeah but i could also play wolverine yeah

1174
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:38,820
either cloak or rocket or mantis you can pick one those
three um and we're not playing bad double and i could

1175
01:20:38,820 --> 01:20:44,960
probably go i could probably ban cloak yeah we're probably
not gonna play mag because i'll probably be on yeah so then

1176
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:52,660
we have to ban cloak then and then after that we bad we can
ban mantis no way they're this is weird they're actually

1177
01:20:52,660 --> 01:21:02,940
banning you maxi oh i think at this point you protect
whatever the you want yeah what do we what do we want to

1178
01:21:02,940 --> 01:21:14,040
play specifically anything for us i think we i mean i think
loki we're good with loki too is wolverine or punish or

1179
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:20,920
punisher for the yeah next he's not gonna be happy about
wolverine no i absolutely love that out of you i'm serious

1180
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:28,620
and then either rocket or mantis i think anita only plays
rocket so you can just do a rocket been but we have to be

1181
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:38,820
aware of the mantis damage boost probably you know about
like the group big wall right me is his his big wall like he

1182
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:44,180
has like the small walls but his big red wall puts him in a
circle and he can't be grabbed by wolverine so like wow they

1183
01:21:44,180 --> 01:21:50,480
didn't ban anything so like if you see that big like dark
larger wall you have to break it so then moxy can grab him

1184
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:57,920
yeah okay and you're like the only damn yeah i mean you're
like our only damage so i'll be breaking it too the walls

1185
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:03,340
the majority of the time okay we should be good say and
again the big one specifically because then do we want me on

1186
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:09,460
something i could i could switch to like punish or something
then and just mow walls down the whole time uh you could my

1187
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:17,860
rush is pretty good i i like the moon night too because if
we're gonna be playing root moon night yeah you can combo

1188
01:22:17,860 --> 01:22:29,240
with me and you agree okay uh you can play which one which
one can you play in visray or a luna um you can do a I feel

1189
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:30,220
like we should do low keys.

1190
01:22:30,220 --> 01:22:31,180
I would go low keys.

1191
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:32,320
Invis low keys.

1192
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:32,800
Yeah.

1193
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:33,540
Invis.

1194
01:22:33,660 --> 01:22:33,800
Yeah.

1195
01:22:33,820 --> 01:22:35,060
I think you're going to evolve throughout this turn.

1196
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:36,300
You're a fast learner, I believe.

1197
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:42,420
Like this Invis, if we got something, yeah, if they have,
you hit the ults, if you give, if we give you something to

1198
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:44,320
pull and you pull it, this is us.

1199
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:45,160
All right, guys.

1200
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:46,720
I am disrupting their healers.

1201
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:48,360
We need somebody to shot, call, and lead.

1202
01:22:48,780 --> 01:22:49,040
Please.

1203
01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:49,800
We need some organization.

1204
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:51,300
Marksy, your target battle.

1205
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:52,320
How are you calling?

1206
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:53,080
Jump back.

1207
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:53,540
Jump back.

1208
01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:55,240
Give me, someone go rock it.

1209
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:55,700
We bad rocket.

1210
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,180
You bad rocket.

1211
01:22:57,500 --> 01:23:00,200
Oh, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

1212
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:01,080
It's like, what do you mean?

1213
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:07,860
If the walls are a problem, let me know and I'll switch to
Punisher because I feel like Moonite has very good wall

1214
01:23:07,860 --> 01:23:07,860
break.

1215
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:09,160
Moonite's really good again.

1216
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:13,160
He might actually have more wall break than Punisher like
statistically in this game.

1217
01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:18,760
Like if you just focus his walls and like if you see that
big wall focus it, Moxie will get free kills.

1218
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:20,260
Look up guys.

1219
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:21,660
Look up.

1220
01:23:21,660 --> 01:23:22,340
I'm looking up.

1221
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:23,060
Oh, there you are.

You have to use your all-if-if-if you keep doing this fight,
so use your-if-if.

1269
01:25:20,540 --> 01:25:21,980

Look at their invid's in the back.

1276
01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:28,900
Invid's in Memphis.

I'm back, I'm back!

1278

If you wanna come down, I have In sentence bomb here.

1280
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:36,880
Hey, Burn-Hella, Burn-Hella.

I don't know if we're gonna be able to.

1283
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:40,500
We can keep going with this fight if we have to.

1284
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:43,960
Oh, just down point.

1285
01:25:44,220 --> 01:25:45,100

I don't know.

1381
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:14,960
It's like reset, reset, reset, reset, reset.

What are we wanting?

1384
01:28:18,740 --> 01:28:19,180
A bot, Calvin.

1385
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:22,540
And you destroyed them.

1386
01:28:23,060 --> 01:28:25,300
We don't have support ults, but they have...

1387
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:26,800
They might have support ults, though.

1388
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:27,820
They used mid.

1389
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:28,460
They might have invis.

1390
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:29,240
Did they use invis, didn't they?

1391
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,060
Strange on the left, he could have ults.

1392
01:28:31,060 --> 01:28:32,840
They used invis when I used invis.

1393
01:28:35,780 --> 01:28:36,660
I have a lot coming up soon.

1394
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:39,300
I didn't get a chance to farm mine a lot.

1395
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:41,580
Well, me on the side, on the side.

1396

1402
01:28:47,260 --> 01:28:47,660
Strange ults!

1403
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:51,060

careful namo up left range up top I'm like, I'm in a bubble.

1634
01:38:45,530 --> 01:38:46,950
I'm in a bubble.

1635
01:38:47,290 --> 01:38:48,430
I'm in on the right.

1636
01:38:48,590 --> 01:38:48,990
I'm in on the right.

1637
01:38:49,310 --> 01:38:52,170
I couldn't get to yours so far.

1638
01:38:52,690 --> 01:38:53,650
I have all, by the way.

1639
01:38:53,810 --> 01:38:54,810
You can also see, oh, never mind.

1640
01:38:54,950 --> 01:38:55,970
Don't say shit.

1641
01:38:57,090 --> 01:38:57,430
We just reset.

1642
01:38:57,670 --> 01:38:57,870
We just reset.

1643
01:38:57,870 --> 01:38:58,430
Yeah, reset, reset.

1644
01:38:58,810 --> 01:38:58,990
Everyone out.

1645
01:38:59,450 --> 01:39:00,170
We still have another fight.

1646
01:39:00,750 --> 01:39:01,370
We have another fight.

1647
01:39:01,510 --> 01:39:01,850
No, no, no.

1648
01:39:01,970 --> 01:39:02,530
Don't worry about TP.

1649
01:39:02,750 --> 01:39:03,230
Don't worry about TP.

1650
01:39:04,050 --> 01:39:04,470
We have to.

1651
01:39:05,370 --> 01:39:05,690
Full reset.

1652
01:39:06,230 --> 01:39:06,410
Full reset.

1653
01:39:07,130 --> 01:39:08,510
We actually might have to CP.

1654
01:39:11,470 --> 01:39:12,310
No, no, no, no, no.

1655
01:39:12,490 --> 01:39:13,390
I'm just going to kill you.

1656
01:39:13,390 --> 01:39:13,950
I'm just going to kill you.

1657
01:39:14,630 --> 01:39:15,730
That's fine, that's fine, that's fine.

1658
01:39:16,970 --> 01:39:18,470
We have to get that 9%.

1659
01:39:18,470 --> 01:39:19,410
I'm TP out.

1660
01:39:19,890 --> 01:39:20,190
I'm going.

1661
01:39:21,330 --> 01:39:22,230
Touchpoint, touchpoint, touchpoint, Tyler.

1662
01:39:23,830 --> 01:39:24,250
Are you gonna get hit?

1663
01:39:24,590 --> 01:39:25,670
I can't, I can't!

1664
01:39:25,830 --> 01:39:27,030
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it!

1665
01:39:27,490 --> 01:39:28,270
That is very good.

1666
01:39:34,740 --> 01:39:35,220
Invent's one.

1667
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:36,720
I'm full focusing in this.

1668
01:39:36,780 --> 01:39:37,580
I need heals on points I'm up.

1669
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:38,340
Thank you.

1670
01:39:38,440 --> 01:39:38,660
Thank you.

1671
01:39:42,780 --> 01:39:43,460
Hello's on the side.

1672
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:44,680
Everyone you see hello.

1673
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:53,860
that to me it's all right though yeah we did i i get it but
it was like i started walking out and then we died and i was

1674
01:39:53,860 --> 01:40:04,240
like oh no we really try team yeah we try that's brutal ggs
it's just around we're figuring it out we're getting better

1675
01:40:04,240 --> 01:40:05,760
the improvements there

1676
01:40:10,290 --> 01:40:17,530
damn dude i think like definitely for sure like no
hesitation with tp because we're like hesitating with like

1677
01:40:17,530 --> 01:40:23,850
what do we die or do we fight and then we just kept getting
staggered there that's brutal too because if we had any if

1678
01:40:23,850 --> 01:40:31,070
anyone else cp we could have literally come up the tp and
rude moonlight bucky combo to everything that's the only

1679
01:40:31,070 --> 01:40:38,770
reason i was like sort of hesitant i think we should try we
should try triple support i think yeah i think so yeah maybe

1680
01:40:38,770 --> 01:40:44,410
it's just so good yeah we're playing next

1681
01:40:50,830 --> 01:41:00,650
who's his team validity, Aramori I think the hardest part is
just that there's a lot of hesitation with my team so we

1682
01:41:00,650 --> 01:41:09,930
have to me and Moxie have to micromanage a lot because
there's like a lot of hesitation and I'm trying to like tell

1683
01:41:09,930 --> 01:41:17,250
them what to do but I also have to know what I have to do as
well you guys are tall if I'm Lunar but like Moxie is busy

1684
01:41:17,250 --> 01:41:22,250
getting killed so that I have to micromanage my so it just
depends on our support coverage in this type of turn would

1685
01:41:22,250 --> 01:41:22,670
probably be fun

1686
01:41:27,030 --> 01:41:32,610
can we teach tyler to tp real quick just in case it's just
that's two games in a row if i think me and moxie's brain

1687
01:41:32,610 --> 01:41:40,530
are exploding oh wait wait what do you know no no it's not
it's not that you're not on the point but but like we had

1688
01:41:40,530 --> 01:41:47,490
the double triple combo like we had group moon night i know
moxie's head is like overwhelmed right now too and i had to

1689
01:41:47,490 --> 01:41:52,530
give up group to tp there Go go practice.

1690
01:41:52,910 --> 01:41:53,470
Yeah, go to the practice.

1691
01:41:53,630 --> 01:41:55,010
It's so it's like the easiest thing in the world.

1692
01:41:55,350 --> 01:41:56,570
Everyone's like second guessing.

1693
01:41:56,750 --> 01:41:59,430
On the right, on the right, on the right of the lobby,
there's a practice.

1694
01:42:00,030 --> 01:42:01,190
What we have to do.

1695
01:42:01,450 --> 01:42:01,610
In practice.

1696
01:42:02,550 --> 01:42:03,230
Are you in the lobby?

1697
01:42:05,290 --> 01:42:05,510
Okay.

1698
01:42:07,350 --> 01:42:08,550
Okay, so then.

1699
01:42:10,230 --> 01:42:11,390
But we're getting better.

1700
01:42:11,690 --> 01:42:12,810
People are getting more confident.

1701
01:42:13,470 --> 01:42:16,990
Because like my co-support is getting more confident.

1702
01:42:17,090 --> 01:42:18,330
Yeah, go Dr. Strange, walk out.

1703
01:42:21,650 --> 01:42:32,690
is you press f yeah and then you just run all the way to the
point that's it and then you press left click and once

1704
01:42:32,690 --> 01:42:37,510
you're at the point but don't do it in the air just do it on
the ground yeah you just don't play don't press the

1705
01:42:37,510 --> 01:42:44,430
reposition button and wherever you put that second portal is
where you are gonna jump through i'm trying i probably i

1706
01:42:44,430 --> 01:42:51,650
just i people do people messing up well with everything
going on because like it's so it's not hard it's It's hard

1707
01:42:51,650 --> 01:42:55,590
to actually know players who are newer at the game because I
have to change the way I talk.

1708
01:42:55,670 --> 01:42:59,070
I'd like do some crazy sequence of events and shit.

1709
01:43:00,110 --> 01:43:01,010
No, you're good.

1710
01:43:01,210 --> 01:43:05,470
But it's good that you see, it's good you came in here and
did that because if you do, if we need it, you could

1711
01:43:05,470 --> 01:43:06,490
literally save our whole game.

1712
01:43:08,110 --> 01:43:15,350
It's a lot harder because the way, because I didn't realize
my code support did not know alt lines because I was like,

1713
01:43:15,590 --> 01:43:20,870
just all when they hear the when you hear the strange alt
line and then he didn't say anything and I later found out.

1714
01:43:21,250 --> 01:43:31,550
didn't even know what the strange alt line is so i was like
oh um just just alt when you just just rip it yeah that's

1715
01:43:31,550 --> 01:43:37,250
good to know you can place it like too high and then not i'm
not used to idealing players who haven't played much of the

1716
01:43:37,250 --> 01:43:43,930
game because i have to change the way i talk i'm wait oh is
that what i did yeah i think when you like when you press uh

1717
01:43:43,930 --> 01:43:49,610
the portal when you press f or whatever to open the portal
you just put your you just literally move your second one

1718
01:43:51,250 --> 01:43:58,910
you reposition your first one that's where like people mess
themselves up yeah yeah i think i think it's also if you i'm

1719
01:43:58,910 --> 01:44:03,050
just gonna check it again to see if this is what i did i
think like i was aiming yeah so it's like we have the micro

1720
01:44:03,050 --> 01:44:08,890
macro and ideas that's why it's like i'm like that's why i'm
not talking a lot in aim down i guess a little bit i'm like

1721
01:44:08,890 --> 01:44:16,710
i'm just overwhelmed right now let's see but like we're
getting better as a team though we get we are getting better

1722
01:44:16,710 --> 01:44:24,790
as a team and then i don't know i don't remember people's
names i don't remember people's name except necros is team

1723
01:44:24,790 --> 01:44:36,650
robs running triple support i'll just be like just that
because i don't know no people's names uh you guys want me

1724
01:44:36,650 --> 01:44:43,210
to support say it go on say you if you want to hit the
rocket

1725
01:44:47,710 --> 01:44:55,150
i'll play rocket okay it's up to you i mean we do have uh no
it's always like oh i always forget everyone i don't

1726
01:44:55,150 --> 01:45:00,230
remember i don't know people half the people's name maybe
we'll see based on the comp and what our bands are to say

1727
01:45:00,230 --> 01:45:08,990
you would be a monster rocket though i won't lie positioning
god yep we need a bands we need a first band mag oh who's

1728
01:45:08,990 --> 01:45:16,590
the mag oh yeah yeah no we do we do yeah the space yeah
definitely okay so i'm gonna go i'm gonna do a practice tool

1729
01:45:16,590 --> 01:45:23,870
of rocket real quick right i'm playing rocket are we doing
rock are we doing trip support with tyler on rocket well

1730
01:45:23,870 --> 01:45:31,350
we'll see how the bands go because i think we could just but
yeah hit the rocket real quick hey don't say it like that

1731
01:45:31,350 --> 01:45:38,970
say hey don't say hit the rocket wait let's say are they
also playing triple support moxie they're running triple

1732
01:45:38,970 --> 01:45:47,890
support so do we just ban triple support and well let's see
the people who they first they banned they banned mag they

1733
01:45:47,890 --> 01:45:58,010
banned rocket they banned squirrel girl i just shoot though
you just right click what does right click do right click is

1734
01:45:58,010 --> 01:46:04,730
the healing hell do you have to aim them at you guys and it
heals you yeah and they'll like slow down when they're near

1735
01:46:04,730 --> 01:46:10,010
a person that needs healing so you can also heal yourself
with them wait this shit's so easy you have res too you make

1736
01:46:10,010 --> 01:46:20,770
sure you throw your res in a in a corner a res beacon so
when we when we load in tyler throw your e down the the

1737
01:46:20,770 --> 01:46:28,570
little machine inside the spawn uh we'll all get armor packs
from it and then uh while we're in the spawn if you press e

1738
01:46:28,570 --> 01:46:33,370
again it will like you'll take it back and then that way you
can place it nearer the point because it needs to be within

1739
01:46:33,370 --> 01:46:39,830
i think it's 50 meters of the point for it to be able to
revive us so place it we'll get our armor packs take it back

1740
01:46:39,830 --> 01:46:46,970
then we run to point place it again where are you solo
tanking then um i guess so i mean we're banning uh it seems

1741
01:46:46,970 --> 01:46:53,150
like it i'm like the only i mean moxie could tank as well
yeah then we don't have a dps player i'm just trying to

1742
01:46:53,150 --> 01:47:02,110
fucking win here guys okay i'm doing what it takes to win
who's with me i'm i'm right there with you i think oh okay

1743
01:47:02,110 --> 01:47:09,890
so probably don't ban rocket because i think erob can play
cloak decent so just well we ban cloak so then we can have

1744
01:47:09,890 --> 01:47:18,490
uh hello hello you guys are a rock if we start the next
match yeah yep started we're ready bro we just we just ban

1745
01:47:18,490 --> 01:47:25,190
cloak because we don't have i don't know overplay mag or not
so we should just get rid of cloak now i'm not for that okay

1746
01:47:26,350 --> 01:47:35,970
they we don't blank ban cloak we might have to mirror cloak
no i don't i don't think erob is going to run cloak if if

1747
01:47:35,970 --> 01:47:40,870
rocket's not banned yeah okay so he's gonna run rocket true
But what were the other two supports playing?

1748
01:47:41,490 --> 01:47:44,670
The other two supports play Invis and Mantis.

1749
01:47:45,010 --> 01:47:45,870
Then we bad Mantis.

1750
01:47:46,010 --> 01:47:48,930
Mantis does the temple too much.

1751
01:47:49,470 --> 01:47:49,850
Okay.

1752
01:47:50,330 --> 01:47:51,590
And we need Invis anyway.

1753
01:47:54,250 --> 01:47:56,050
Because Epic plays Invis.

1754
01:47:57,290 --> 01:47:57,450
True.

1755
01:47:58,590 --> 01:47:59,470
Guys, we can't lose D-Rob.

1756
01:47:59,590 --> 01:47:59,910
Come on.

1757
01:48:05,370 --> 01:48:07,750
Oh my gosh, just a hard target, man.

1758
01:48:09,690 --> 01:48:18,350
damn every time we need an alias for moxie bro he's gotta be
wait do we think we need a bad strange where's uh space i

1759
01:48:18,350 --> 01:48:24,350
mean you probably play emba yeah i mean he's gonna play he's
gonna be good at probably anything was the one that got buff

1760
01:48:24,350 --> 01:48:32,210
right yeah but he's gonna play an emba though oh okay um
save

1761
01:48:35,850 --> 01:48:44,450
venom yeah yeah yeah just in case just the case that also
might make them think we're not going triple support if

1762
01:48:44,450 --> 01:48:51,370
we're protecting it well everyone else is going triple
support so yeah literally they want as many supports as

1763
01:49:02,230 --> 01:49:15,110
possible they're just target banning you all the time yeah
okay now do we want to ban man lulu plays a lot of invis um

1764
01:49:15,110 --> 01:49:21,310
i mean we can do she's also I already banned Mantis then.

1765
01:49:21,370 --> 01:49:22,790
Yeah, I could ban Mantis too.

1766
01:49:24,870 --> 01:49:27,390
So at least they don't, at least like, they don't get a
damage boost.

1767
01:49:29,670 --> 01:49:33,270
And then we can either ban Loki, we could ban Loki so they
can't run Gambit Loki.

1768
01:49:34,730 --> 01:49:36,270
I don't think they'll play Gambit.

1769
01:49:36,330 --> 01:49:39,450
Well, if they're running Loki, my Moon Knight is going to
crush them.

1770
01:49:39,570 --> 01:49:39,930
Yeah.

1771
01:49:40,630 --> 01:49:41,570
Oh, that's true.

1772
01:49:41,690 --> 01:49:42,630
So we don't have to ban Loki.

1773
01:49:43,270 --> 01:49:44,170
Then we just ban Invis.

1774
01:49:45,090 --> 01:49:48,150
And then we can run Luna Gambit or Luna.

1775
01:49:48,290 --> 01:49:48,610
Loki.

1776
01:49:53,980 --> 01:49:56,460
I could also ban spaces, Emma.

1777
01:49:58,500 --> 01:49:59,420
If you want to.

1778
01:49:59,620 --> 01:50:03,520
Okay, so now they're going to be solo tanking because Dean's
going to play Squirrel Girl.

1779
01:50:04,060 --> 01:50:04,360
Okay.

1780
01:50:05,320 --> 01:50:10,160
Do we want to solo tank Emma or Strange for them?

1781
01:50:12,740 --> 01:50:13,680
What do you think?

1782
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:16,180
Are you thinking of banning Emma, you said?

1783
01:50:16,600 --> 01:50:17,560
I'll do it with Gavin Scott.

1784
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:18,420
Emma or Invis.

1785
01:50:21,480 --> 01:50:30,820
like do we want space to play strange or emma or do we bend
invis i think i'd rather have him on emma just because i

1786
01:50:30,820 --> 01:50:40,140
feel like strange ults in this are really strong but there's
no portal okay yeah i'll bend i'll bend invis then because i

1787
01:50:40,140 --> 01:50:48,540
think he'll pick emma anyways oh yeah you're probably right
then we can run loki luna rocket wait they're not running

1788
01:50:48,540 --> 01:50:55,840
mag right they can't run mag so we can do cloak as well all
right i just go cloak then because i feel like you carry

1789
01:50:55,840 --> 01:51:01,460
harder on loki though yeah i was gonna say we might need you
on loki yeah all right just because like cloaks cloaks alt

Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

I'm trying to stay in front of you.

1947
01:58:59,900 --> 01:59:00,360
I might need help.

1948
01:59:00,440 --> 01:59:00,980
I need help here.

1949
01:59:00,980 --> 01:59:01,820
It is.

1950
01:59:02,340 --> 01:59:03,060
It is down point.

1951
01:59:03,820 --> 01:59:07,500
Oh, someone moved me to the other team's call.

1952
01:59:08,820 --> 01:59:09,880
Um, wait, what?

1953
01:59:10,620 --> 01:59:12,700
I was in Bougar in their call.

1954
01:59:13,020 --> 01:59:14,060
Why are you in here?

1955
01:59:14,160 --> 01:59:15,340
I'm like, I don't, I was like, I don't know.

1956
01:59:15,500 --> 01:59:16,440
I'm playing the game.

1957
01:59:16,820 --> 01:59:17,700
Grab armor as you come, pause.

1958
01:59:18,240 --> 01:59:18,900
Yeah, yeah.

1959
01:59:20,020 --> 01:59:21,100
There's a jump back there.

1960
01:59:21,100 --> 01:59:22,160
I have ult here.

1961
01:59:22,380 --> 01:59:23,320
So I'll use my first.

1962
01:59:23,620 --> 01:59:24,640
We do the same way.

1963
01:59:24,640 --> 01:59:25,380
I have ult now as well.

1964
01:59:25,720 --> 01:59:26,740
We use my ult to engage.

1965
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:27,280
You guys ready?

1966
01:59:27,900 --> 01:59:28,180
Yeah.

1967
01:59:28,420 --> 01:59:29,720

1968
01:59:29,980 --> 01:59:30,860

01:59:40,310 --> 01:59:41,030
Rocket alting.

1973
01:59:41,290 --> 01:59:42,210
Rocket alting down on point.

1974
01:59:45,930 --> 01:59:46,570
Careful, careful, rocket.

1975
01:59:46,750 --> 01:59:48,370
Run back up, yeah, they Broke are alt.

1976

Good.

1982
01:59:58,310 --> 01:59:58,790
We're done.

1983
01:59:58,910 --> 01:59:59,330
You're the DPS.

1984
01:59:59,670 --> 02:00:00,670
Yeah, we at Portal.

1985
02:00:00,810 --> 02:00:01,150
We need Portal.

1986
02:00:01,290 --> 02:00:01,590
We need Portal.

1987
02:00:01,770 --> 02:00:02,430
Someone swapped this game.

1988
02:00:03,470 --> 02:00:04,070
You got it?

1989
02:00:04,490 --> 02:00:05,230
Back up, back up, back up.

1990
02:00:05,470 --> 02:00:07,110
Epic, come back, come back, come back.

1991
02:00:07,270 --> 02:00:07,710
Everyone out.

1992
02:00:07,830 --> 02:00:08,450
All the way to spawn.

1993
02:00:09,190 --> 02:00:10,090
Just run all the way.

1994
02:00:12,310 --> 02:00:13,410
Okay, it's on their back line.

1995
02:00:13,530 --> 02:00:14,170
It's on their back line.

1996
02:00:14,430 --> 02:00:16,530
You can't, you're gonna have to throw the rocket thing out
or we're not gonna...

1997
02:00:16,530 --> 02:00:17,110
Yep, yeah, yeah, I know.

1998
02:00:18,010 --> 02:00:19,850
Punish, punish, punish, punish, kill.

1999
02:00:20,130 --> 02:00:21,810
We'll play inside the portal if you need to.

2000
02:00:23,170 --> 02:00:23,690
I'm on the back.

2001
02:00:23,870 --> 02:00:24,310
I'm on the point.

2002
02:00:24,310 --> 02:00:24,630
I'm on point.

2003
02:00:24,730 --> 02:00:25,010
I'm on point.

2004
02:00:25,110 --> 02:00:25,170
I'm on point.

2005
02:00:25,170 --> 02:00:25,790
Don't worry about it.

2006
02:00:30,170 --> 02:00:30,730
Hi, Squirtle.

2007
02:00:30,870 --> 02:00:31,130
Squirtle.

2008
02:00:31,430 --> 02:00:31,710
Yeah, yeah.

2009
02:00:31,750 --> 02:00:32,830
I didn't see that.

2010
02:00:34,270 --> 02:00:34,690
Come on.

2011
02:00:34,690 --> 02:00:35,750
Just chill, just chill.

2012
02:00:35,990 --> 02:00:36,550
We have no support.

2013
02:00:36,810 --> 02:00:37,430
Oh, guys, chill, chill, chill.

2014
02:00:37,890 --> 02:00:38,090
Chill, chill.

2015
02:00:38,410 --> 02:00:38,950
We have nothing.

2016
02:00:40,070 --> 02:00:40,990
Clearly just you and Tyler.

2017
02:00:45,980 --> 02:00:46,300
Yeah.

2018
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:48,500
Oh, we did get sabotage, though.

2019
02:00:48,540 --> 02:00:49,340
So it's not on us.

2020
02:00:49,780 --> 02:00:50,780
We did get, dude.

2021
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:54,960
I literally was like, yeah, I was telling you, I was going
to really ammo, and I'm like, they're like, you're going to

2022
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:55,220
ammo.

2023
02:00:55,420 --> 02:00:56,560
I'm like, what?

2024
02:00:56,880 --> 02:00:57,160
What?

2025
02:00:57,300 --> 02:00:57,680
Is that weird?

2026
02:00:58,020 --> 02:00:59,480
Like, oh, why is closet article?

2027
02:00:59,620 --> 02:01:00,360
That's so weird.

2028
02:01:00,580 --> 02:01:00,700
What the?

2029
02:01:00,720 --> 02:01:01,640
Who moved you?

2030
02:01:01,820 --> 02:01:03,540
Who even has permission to do that?

2031
02:01:04,100 --> 02:01:04,800
Mid game?

2032
02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:06,760
Yeah.

2033
02:01:09,340 --> 02:01:18,840
I didn't love you It's okay It's the underdog art And then
in the After round robin We go back up God I think we need

2034
02:01:18,840 --> 02:01:29,740
to win these next two games bad Alright Moxie Have you
figured out the comp for us Well fuck Don't talk in game

2035
02:01:29,740 --> 02:01:34,160
Moxie You're not saying a word to anybody You're just
playing bro How can anybody be the best player But you don't

2036
02:01:34,160 --> 02:01:39,280
fucking speak We don't know shit I don't know what to do
You're not telling me about what to do bro doing a great job

2037
02:01:39,280 --> 02:01:50,360
same with donkey with the comms it's tough dude like i gotta
shoot the gun and shit i have a 200 hp and abandoned me out

2038
02:01:50,360 --> 02:01:56,780
for a while yeah but it's not you're not saying a single
word it's kind of weird i it's i don't know he's just locked

2039
02:01:56,780 --> 02:02:05,020
in he's got his tongue out yeah carry god damn it i'm just
trying moxie you were first pick for him you gotta carry you

2040
02:02:05,020 --> 02:02:06,780
were his first pick you gotta carry

2041
02:02:10,460 --> 02:02:12,240
Dude, these guys are fucking pussies.

2042
02:02:12,360 --> 02:02:13,340
This is all I gotta say.

2043
02:02:17,100 --> 02:02:17,980
God damn.

2044
02:02:19,440 --> 02:02:21,700
I guess, Moxie, you might have to expand your hero pool.

2045
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:23,640
Wait, metaphor was one above all?

2046
02:02:23,960 --> 02:02:24,240
Yeah.

2047
02:02:25,400 --> 02:02:26,100
Oh my god.

2048
02:02:26,180 --> 02:02:27,680
What a steal for the second round pick.

2049
02:02:28,240 --> 02:02:31,420
You got one above all plus a space.

2050
02:02:31,980 --> 02:02:32,940
Two one above alls.

2051
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:34,220
Hmm.

2052
02:02:36,420 --> 02:02:37,200
What was he playing?

2053
02:02:37,240 --> 02:02:38,000
What was metaphor playing there?

2054
02:02:38,480 --> 02:02:39,600
Punisher, I think, right?

2055
02:02:39,600 --> 02:02:39,900
Punisher.

2056
02:02:40,020 --> 02:02:45,600
yeah gotcha god that ult in these types of things is just so
crazy you know what comp is best for us because i think we

2057
02:02:45,600 --> 02:02:54,840
do well with two two and i don't know if triple support is
good for us yeah it's maybe we should just we should back to

2058
02:02:54,840 --> 02:03:03,780
two two maybe that yeah but maybe we should focus on like
having a support kill combo like just like a punisher in in

2059
02:03:03,780 --> 02:03:10,100
this type of thing because like they punish her out there
and there's nothing i mean there's literally nothing we

2060
02:03:10,100 --> 02:03:20,020
could do like with their rocket alt down or whatever or just
getting walked we just let everyone play their comfort pick

2061
02:03:20,020 --> 02:03:27,320
maybe yeah also we could if there's anything we want to like
experiment with these next two games are perfect because

2062
02:03:27,320 --> 02:03:32,400
we're like we're not going to be top seed anyway so we might
as well use the games to like gather as much data as we can

2063
02:03:32,400 --> 02:03:40,320
yeah well do we do we even move on to for the last two seeds
no no it's round and after that it's just uh best of one

2064
02:03:40,320 --> 02:03:47,360
with the uh with whoever's first or second uh or third or
fourth we still go into quarters like everyone will go into

2065
02:03:47,360 --> 02:03:54,140
quarters after these two matches so we can use the two
matches to just like figure out any comps that we want to

2066
02:03:54,140 --> 02:04:02,420
run in the actual like 20 matches themselves yeah winning
these games would be huge too because we probably won't be

2067
02:04:02,420 --> 02:04:06,820
like we definitely don't want to be last seed because then
we're versus someone who probably went like five and five

2068
02:04:10,020 --> 02:04:16,780
So we can mess around and like figure it out, but we
definitely want to, uh, we, if we win these next two games,

2069
02:04:16,900 --> 02:04:17,260
that'd be huge.

2070
02:04:17,600 --> 02:04:19,060
Otherwise we're kind of putting ourselves in a bad spot.

2071
02:04:19,440 --> 02:04:21,620
I'm not trying to be that guy, guys, but we've won one
round.

2072
02:04:22,060 --> 02:04:22,540
Oh yeah.

2073
02:04:24,300 --> 02:04:25,160
Yeah, we have.

2074
02:04:25,820 --> 02:04:27,300
I mean, we could have won the next C1.

2075
02:04:27,460 --> 02:04:28,160
That was real close.

2076
02:04:28,500 --> 02:04:29,360
We should have won that too.

2077
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:36,380
Like that was, I think, yeah, I think maybe we, didn't you
want to try Naimore?

2078
02:04:36,640 --> 02:04:38,340
Wait, someone said they wanted to try Naimore.

2079
02:04:38,800 --> 02:04:39,220
I can.

2080
02:04:40,020 --> 02:04:44,920
that out i think we should try to switch off moon knight we
didn't play like comfort picks i think name where is fine

2081
02:04:44,920 --> 02:04:49,200
because the turrets would be really good especially against
like lower elo players so you don't know how to shoot

2082
02:04:49,200 --> 02:04:55,320
turrets there's also kind of hard because they're we have
moon knight into triple support and they're just like giving

2083
02:04:55,320 --> 02:05:02,800
them a lot of damage we're giving them all support else yeah
yeah that's true so just go name where and then don't let

2084
02:05:02,800 --> 02:05:11,740
tyler play anything but venom well the squids do the same
thing fuck off i could dude if my raccoon was i 5k hilly no

2085
02:05:11,740 --> 02:05:18,100
it's just it just wasn't it it was just not for the comp or
you were your record was great it was just your venom was so

2086
02:05:18,100 --> 02:05:24,660
good you know that it just is a game changer yeah you're
right yeah yeah so it's like we have to put you on your best

2087
02:05:24,660 --> 02:05:36,320
character tyler effects yeah me out there's also isn't that
also a venom hella team up right yes so we could and i think

2088
02:05:36,320 --> 02:05:44,460
that gives doesn't that give venom like more health i think
like 100 more health or something no no no no no just no he

2089
02:05:44,460 --> 02:05:50,280
has that just for having yeah he just has that for just
existing with the team up yeah that's what i mean so like

2090
02:05:50,280 --> 02:05:54,640
without the team up as well he has it oh oh okay speech one
500.

2091
02:05:55,660 --> 02:06:02,540
because we could rather than because i'm thinking if we're
worried about the supports on their team just getting fed

2092
02:06:02,540 --> 02:06:07,760
ult charged by like chip damage from the moon night the kind
of same thing is going to happen with the square turrets

2093
02:06:07,760 --> 02:06:17,240
kind of so if I was to try in Hella, that might be more
burst damage, and then it also means that I benefit from the

2094
02:06:17,240 --> 02:06:18,180
venom being on the team, maybe?

2095
02:06:18,420 --> 02:06:19,580
But maybe I'm overcooking it.

2096
02:06:28,850 --> 02:06:30,190
I don't know.

2097
02:06:30,230 --> 02:06:33,510
I don't really play Hella.

2098
02:06:33,650 --> 02:06:34,770
Sounds like that was not a cook.

2099
02:06:35,350 --> 02:06:37,410
You're like, what the fuck is this guy saying?

2100
02:06:38,110 --> 02:06:41,910
He might be overestimating how big the team up is for Hella
in the Bene.

2101
02:06:41,970 --> 02:06:48,970
I think it's fine to try a team up only because everyone's
teams are so like like some people have bronze players some

2102
02:06:48,970 --> 02:06:57,110
people have like like you know plat players so i think your
hell is fine we just try it just try i'm happy i think i i

2103
02:06:57,110 --> 02:07:01,930
think it's better he plays like phoenix or something's more
comfortable and we just don't have the team up if if if

2104
02:07:01,930 --> 02:07:09,970
what's his name's if robin waffle is comfortable and yeah on
namor i don't think the team up is like why put why put

2105
02:07:09,970 --> 02:07:18,230
moxie on like someone who he's not he doesn't play i've seen
this hella his hell sure it's good i mean you are you are

2106
02:07:18,230 --> 02:07:26,190
over hyping guys i know my own abilities i'm i do it with
moxie and i've just don't put him on like spider-man or

2107
02:07:26,190 --> 02:07:34,110
something i was really about to suggest spider-man i'm not
even kidding for this map we would have to we'd have to put

2108
02:07:34,110 --> 02:07:42,910
money in the other team's pocket if we want moxie on the
long guy yeah okay the only i'm the only person who plays

2109
02:07:42,910 --> 02:07:47,750
the character that counters the triple support i know dude
yeah i mean that's why they ban you because they first ban

2110
02:07:47,750 --> 02:08:00,310
it every time is that hulk right yeah uh yeah because they
can use just headshots yeah and they're just scared they

2111
02:08:00,310 --> 02:08:08,890
don't want to deal with it i mean they've banned like
captain america too so it's crazy i think wait what were we

2112
02:08:08,890 --> 02:08:15,470
banning for class that's your like second best yeah i mean
yeah i could just like Yeah, probably.

2113
02:08:16,110 --> 02:08:18,170
But gosh, what does Flats team play?

2114
02:08:18,590 --> 02:08:19,450
Is it triple support?

2115
02:08:20,810 --> 02:08:21,570
Let's see.

2116
02:08:22,530 --> 02:08:23,630
Yeah, we'll figure it out.

2117
02:08:24,210 --> 02:08:27,510
Daltush is going to be probably DPS, and I think he's
controller.

2118
02:08:28,150 --> 02:08:33,310
Guys, also have I been lagging or not, or not, because I
just realized I was playing just the entire tab.

2119
02:08:33,610 --> 02:08:34,510
So was I lagging?

2120
02:08:34,650 --> 02:08:37,370
The whole team is like looking weird.

2121
02:08:38,590 --> 02:08:40,190
Wait, R4 is not even playing support.

2122
02:08:41,090 --> 02:08:41,450
Wait, really?

2123
02:08:41,490 --> 02:08:42,930
I think they just have too many support players.

2124
02:08:44,090 --> 02:08:55,230
it was is frogger good he's frog road oh w right or probably
it's probably okay is he not is it what he's playing he's he

2125
02:08:55,230 --> 02:09:04,870
played deadpool um oh boy interesting dps deadpool support
deadpool or tank deadpool tank deadpool okay so it's what

2126
02:09:04,870 --> 02:09:14,890
triple tank are they going they're going triple tank then we
have to run i guess we do have to run moon night i was gonna

2127
02:09:14,890 --> 02:09:21,090
say we can yeah the moon night can be perfect yeah okay
adult two she apparently plays jeff and hella and they

2128
02:09:21,090 --> 02:09:30,430
banned hella they banned jeff and hella so do we just ban
jeff and hella and then they banned someone's iron fist i

2129
02:09:30,430 --> 02:09:42,690
might assume oh wait yeah we had wait i think that's
frogger's iron fist so we just Daltush do if both his chance

2130
02:09:42,690 --> 02:09:43,170
to ban him.

2131
02:09:43,490 --> 02:09:46,630
He goes Punisher and it looked like he did the best on the
team.

2132
02:09:46,650 --> 02:09:48,970
Wait, but did they win or lose?

2133
02:09:50,810 --> 02:09:52,890
They're still did they win or lose?

2134
02:09:53,210 --> 02:09:53,650
They're still playing.

2135
02:09:53,790 --> 02:09:54,230
Oh, okay.

2136
02:09:54,370 --> 02:09:55,850
What are their previous games?

2137
02:09:56,070 --> 02:09:57,470
Going to lose though, it looks like.

2138
02:09:57,570 --> 02:09:58,290
Oh, no.

2139
02:10:02,820 --> 02:10:04,240
Oh, Moxie, figure out the bans.

2140
02:10:05,300 --> 02:10:08,100
Guys, come on, Doki, help me out here as well with the ban.

2141
02:10:08,540 --> 02:10:09,640
I've been helping out.

2142
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:21,180
You give me a baseline ban and then I'll if it's good or not
that's what i've been doing okay um you have more hours of

2143
02:10:21,180 --> 02:10:30,760
rivals than me is there more just playing she dps the whole
time or i thought she was tank she's on dps right now i need

2144
02:10:30,760 --> 02:10:37,480
to just swap between yeah i think they just have not i think
they might have too many supporter like i think yeah worse

2145
02:10:41,070 --> 02:10:52,500
they are running triple support right yeah they try to we're
back just like I don't even know what Deadpool's old does

2146
02:10:52,500 --> 02:10:59,900
like I'm watching him um why around and like it depends on
if he's on his katanas or guns if he's on guns he can target

2147
02:10:59,900 --> 02:11:06,920
one single person and that person doesn't hit him they take
damage and also your team gets healed and if he's on the

2148
02:11:06,920 --> 02:11:12,940
katanas if he's on katanas um he has to make combos and
stuff on like the enemy team and that'll heal and damage

2149
02:11:12,940 --> 02:11:21,720
boost your team okay got you it's interesting every time i i
every time i've watched them all in any of these games i'm i

2150
02:11:21,720 --> 02:11:25,040
don't know what if i should be like looking back at them or
if i should just ignore them

2151
02:11:28,440 --> 02:11:36,980
yeah i try to i try to peel the deadpool sometimes but i'm
like it's kind of some that deadpool has three different

2152
02:11:36,980 --> 02:11:43,600
bands do we it is yeah but isn't it like he's not people
don't know how to play him yet so it's like we don't have to

2153
02:11:43,600 --> 02:11:50,360
worry for now until that was kind of moving on them how many
hours do you have in on them already yeah but he had early

2154
02:11:50,360 --> 02:11:59,080
access though so that early access has been spamming that
all day yeah if he has 20 i mean he could be really good is

2155
02:11:59,080 --> 02:12:07,540
we can't ban it because it's three different roles yeah we
can ban tank and dps pool but and then there's support pool

2156
02:12:07,540 --> 02:12:17,100
left um wait so are we banning hella jeff and iron fist Is
that our band line?

2157
02:12:19,880 --> 02:12:20,360
Uh.

2158
02:12:20,840 --> 02:12:21,820
I guess so.

2159
02:12:22,020 --> 02:12:22,880
I think so.

2160
02:12:23,780 --> 02:12:25,220
Then you just have to deal with.

2161
02:12:27,600 --> 02:12:27,760
Hella.

2162
02:12:27,800 --> 02:12:30,200
Seems like a Lindy's playing Jeff.

2163
02:12:30,820 --> 02:12:31,980
And there's Hella, Jeff.

2164
02:12:32,720 --> 02:12:32,980
Yeah.

2165
02:12:33,340 --> 02:12:34,720
If, if a little Rock gets.

2166
02:12:36,320 --> 02:12:36,700
I don't know.

2167
02:12:36,780 --> 02:12:37,320
This is so.

2168
02:12:37,560 --> 02:12:38,760
This is very hard.

2169
02:12:39,340 --> 02:12:40,680
I mean, what do you want first band?

2170
02:12:41,020 --> 02:12:41,580
Hella or Jeff?

2171
02:12:47,860 --> 02:12:49,220
Are you more scared of a Hella?

2172
02:12:50,420 --> 02:12:51,660
players play Jeff, right?

2173
02:12:51,680 --> 02:12:52,760
Then we first ban Jeff.

2174
02:12:53,200 --> 02:12:54,400
But Hella is the playmaker.

2175
02:12:55,500 --> 02:12:56,780
I'm surprised they had Daltush on Jeff.

2176
02:12:57,020 --> 02:13:02,880
Like he literally, that would be like a such a random This
first ban Hella because she's a playmaker.

2177
02:13:03,340 --> 02:13:04,500
They first ban Iron Fist.

2178
02:13:05,300 --> 02:13:06,500
People first banned Iron Fist.

2179
02:13:06,740 --> 02:13:07,760
They banned Hella after.

2180
02:13:07,860 --> 02:13:09,360
They banned Jeff after.

2181
02:13:09,780 --> 02:13:10,000
Oh.

2182
02:13:10,480 --> 02:13:11,500
Then we just follow that.

2183
02:13:14,480 --> 02:13:15,360
Yeah, I think that's fine.

2184
02:13:15,620 --> 02:13:16,080
That's fine.

2185
02:13:16,320 --> 02:13:17,680
We'll just steal their ban line.

2186
02:13:18,520 --> 02:13:19,280
Did they lose or win?

2187
02:13:20,420 --> 02:13:30,720
they've lost so far okay we'll just we'll just follow their
band line then iron fist and then helen and jeff okay i like

2188
02:13:30,720 --> 02:13:42,180
that they're joining now buys i'm back sorry also we have a
hundred ping because they added ping on us oh yeah yeah bad

2189
02:13:42,180 --> 02:13:51,700
i don't buy an iron fist so then he can't he has to play
like not super aim intensive heroes Yeah, I think they

2190
02:13:51,700 --> 02:14:00,220
should actually move everyone's ping down to the best ping
in the lobby That is true if it's only one person whose ping

2191
02:14:00,220 --> 02:14:07,200
is that high It should be majority rules like this dude's
playing on 182 so we're all playing on 182 is what I mean is

2192
02:14:07,200 --> 02:14:11,740
like Basically, that's crazy, bro, like we all got greens
and this guy's red

2193
02:14:25,600 --> 02:14:28,060
Did we decide anything while I was gone any new?

2194
02:14:28,660 --> 02:14:35,000
Yeah I'll first tell out Jeff and then we protect venom
first And then second protect is whatever Moxie feels

2195
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:35,660
comfortable.

2196
02:14:36,980 --> 02:14:38,560
And they're triple tanking, we said.

2197
02:14:39,060 --> 02:14:42,260
I think you can play Namor because they weren't actually
triple tanking.

2198
02:14:42,380 --> 02:14:42,920
They were swapping.

2199
02:14:43,120 --> 02:14:44,400
They were just playing around with cops.

2200
02:14:45,100 --> 02:14:45,420
Okay.

2201
02:14:48,020 --> 02:14:50,300
Yeah, I'll try the Namor out then and see how it feels.

2202
02:14:50,360 --> 02:14:50,920
Guys, don't jinx us.

2203
02:14:51,280 --> 02:14:52,380
Guys, don't bully us.

2204
02:14:52,560 --> 02:14:52,860
We have...

2205
02:14:54,080 --> 02:14:55,960
We are trying our best.

2206
02:14:56,300 --> 02:14:57,360
I was just like, don't bully us.

2207
02:14:57,360 --> 02:14:58,020
What am I going to play?

2208
02:14:58,600 --> 02:14:58,980
Yeah.

2209
02:14:59,440 --> 02:15:01,140
You can play Alkaid because it's not going to get bad.

2210
02:15:02,560 --> 02:15:08,180
I mean, if it's open, we should first protect Hawkeye for
sure.

2211
02:15:08,260 --> 02:15:10,500
If they don't, I stopped myself, I was like, fuck it.

2212
02:15:11,680 --> 02:15:13,940
Yeah, I think so.

2213
02:15:14,700 --> 02:15:16,900
Yeah, I think that would be the most valuable for that.

2214
02:15:17,260 --> 02:15:18,960
Bro, he's a pro, yes.

2215
02:15:19,200 --> 02:15:19,660
I believe.

2216
02:15:19,840 --> 02:15:20,440
Yeah, I believe.

2217
02:15:21,160 --> 02:15:25,260
Guys, if you don't believe, we lose.

2218
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,060
Bucky or Cap or...

2219
02:15:29,760 --> 02:15:30,200
Yes.

2220
02:15:30,740 --> 02:15:31,980
I need you to believe.

2221
02:15:32,060 --> 02:15:45,080
in us look i know i'm doing my part is that anything i need
to do like to help me doing my job i'm trying to keep them

2222
02:15:45,080 --> 02:15:53,020
squishy for you what are you playing name more yeah this
this game name more unless they triple tank if they triple

2223
02:15:53,020 --> 02:16:00,320
tank i'll go back to moonlight but i was gonna give the name
more a try i feel like you have time on bucky too bucky's

2224
02:16:00,320 --> 02:16:06,160
like pretty all right i i have some time on bucky but i'm
much he's just more comfortable on name where we should put

2225
02:16:06,160 --> 02:16:11,960
him on his comfort i'm less consistent on bucky basically so
like i'm i will either have a good game or i will do very

2226
02:16:11,960 --> 02:16:23,540
little um yeah then putting his comfort pick and then he'll
he'll surprise us all with how good he is listen i thought i

2227
02:16:23,540 --> 02:16:28,080
thought that first ult got all five of them that first game
i was like oh i'm good at the game all of a sudden hell yeah

2228
02:16:28,080 --> 02:16:32,620
yeah it's warm up guys it's warm up until we round.

2229
02:16:33,560 --> 02:16:33,560
Yeah.

2230
02:16:33,860 --> 02:16:34,060
Yeah.

2231
02:16:34,280 --> 02:16:34,280
Yeah.

2232
02:16:34,460 --> 02:16:35,200
This all warm up.

2233
02:16:35,300 --> 02:16:38,680
We make them, we give them like low expectations and then
change it around.

2234
02:16:39,480 --> 02:16:39,940
I like that.

2235
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:40,560
I mean, it's happening.

2236
02:16:41,100 --> 02:16:41,100
Yeah.

2237
02:16:41,120 --> 02:16:41,120
Yeah.

2238
02:16:41,260 --> 02:16:41,260
Yeah.

2239
02:16:41,260 --> 02:16:42,600
They're like, oh, look at this team.

2240
02:16:42,700 --> 02:16:43,680
It was so easy to beat them.

2241
02:16:43,780 --> 02:16:45,600
And then we like pull out our Trump card.

2242
02:16:46,400 --> 02:16:47,400
We were like fucking around.

2243
02:16:48,320 --> 02:16:48,900
Right, guys?

2244
02:16:49,040 --> 02:16:50,480
We're all not playing our best, right?

2245
02:16:50,660 --> 02:16:51,020
Yeah.

2246
02:16:51,220 --> 02:16:51,580
Yeah.

2247
02:16:51,740 --> 02:16:52,420
I've been, yeah.

2248
02:16:52,620 --> 02:16:54,880
We were sad bagging, right, guys?

2249
02:16:55,540 --> 02:16:56,120
I think so.

2250
02:16:56,260 --> 02:16:56,640
I think we were.

2251
02:16:56,980 --> 02:16:58,340
I'm a Mr. Fantastic man.

2252
02:16:58,340 --> 02:16:58,560
Yeah.

2253
02:16:58,780 --> 02:16:59,540
We're going to win.

2254
02:16:59,680 --> 02:17:00,720
Lock the fuck in.

2255
02:17:01,160 --> 02:17:02,260
I'm eating Fine.

2256
02:17:02,700 --> 02:17:04,040
I'm getting all my energy back.

2257
02:17:04,220 --> 02:17:05,180
Okay, he's powering up.

02:17:05,360 --> 02:17:06,900
Yeah, I need some calories, too.

What do you mean you don't have a snack?

2265
02:17:19,500 --> 02:17:20,680

Oh, we're guaranteed to win now.

2273
02:17:29,360 --> 02:17:29,640
Yeah.

2274
02:17:30,620 --> 02:17:31,580

these turnies but haven't played him like since then okay

2279
02:18:03,200 --> 02:18:11,560

better than he wasn't the last time i played him he was bad

2280
02:18:14,380 --> 02:18:19,480
yeah i feel like he could go crazy if i if i played him
again maybe i was just trying to play him back then to get

2281
02:18:19,480 --> 02:18:25,320
lord on him and i i remember my uh my win rate percentage or
whatever was like 75 on him when he sucks so i was like i'm

2282
02:18:25,320 --> 02:18:32,540
gonna keep playing him in the turni if they want it i'm it
was good but yeah yeah yeah reset literally the new season

2283
02:18:32,540 --> 02:18:41,260
just started season six just i it's so funny that they like
advertise this as a deadpool invitational and like no one's

2284
02:18:41,260 --> 02:18:48,880
playing dead i know they just lost that right i think
they're over loss hello hello sorry for the delay here uh

2285
02:18:48,880 --> 02:18:54,920
while we let the other games finish uh you guys ready rock
yeah um i mean the enemy team is missing one player i'm

2286
02:18:54,920 --> 02:18:59,720
missing a person she's afk she'll back in one second and
then then as soon as she's here we'll get rolling

2287
02:19:04,960 --> 02:19:14,320
yeah there's that it doesn't make much sense to me let's
actually actually teams three zero down your team is stacked

2288
02:19:14,320 --> 02:19:20,620
i'm not gonna lie he screamed he was screaming they're
chasing after me like that whole game that whole entire game

2289
02:19:20,620 --> 02:19:28,740
was i have maybe that i don't really wait yeah go ahead go
ahead no no no Yeah, I was going to say, if they're 3-0, we

2290
02:19:28,740 --> 02:19:30,880
had a really tight match against them.

2291
02:19:32,080 --> 02:19:33,160
Yeah, I mean, we should have won that one.

2292
02:19:33,240 --> 02:19:35,420
Yeah, but maybe he hasn't versed the best teams yet.

2293
02:19:36,680 --> 02:19:37,000
Oh.

2294
02:19:37,420 --> 02:19:38,680
They have played us, though.

2295
02:19:38,760 --> 02:19:39,020
Sorry.

2296
02:19:39,080 --> 02:19:41,200
Yeah, but he hasn't played us when we were trying, though.

2297
02:19:41,500 --> 02:19:42,720
Yeah, that's true.

2298
02:19:43,180 --> 02:19:44,200
It wasn't after the warm-up.

2299
02:19:44,580 --> 02:19:47,940
Yeah, we were not warmed up when we played them, and we were
also throwing on purpose.

2300
02:19:48,260 --> 02:19:50,940
Yeah, but that's, wait, so then that might be the best comp,
the one we did against.

2301
02:19:50,980 --> 02:19:52,620
2-2 might be the best for us, then.

2302
02:19:53,620 --> 02:19:54,380
Yeah, we could do it.

2303
02:19:54,440 --> 02:19:59,180
If they go triple and we're just getting smoked by ults, we
can swap but i'm down to do 222 let's start on it at least

2304
02:19:59,180 --> 02:20:09,400
yeah i know what were you gonna say mr raffle raffle yeah my
my chat's telling me that we would be winning if tyler

goodness!

2308
02:20:29,080 --> 02:20:29,420
I did!

2309
02:20:30,940 --> 02:20:32,600
I got spies in the chat.

2310
02:20:32,620 --> 02:20:33,420
I did, I did!

2311
02:20:33,700 --> 02:20:34,420
Watch yourself.

2312
02:20:35,240 --> 02:20:37,840
Eyes in the back of your head, the rest of the tournament
you hear.

2313
02:20:38,320 --> 02:20:39,180
I was, bro.

2314
02:20:39,260 --> 02:20:40,360
I was curious, man.

2315
02:20:41,200 --> 02:20:41,780
Were you curious?

2316
02:20:42,960 --> 02:20:44,700
I don't know if they were all curious.

2317
02:20:45,360 --> 02:20:45,900
He asked.

2318
02:20:46,960 --> 02:20:48,420
Confirmation and then still pulled it up.

2319
02:20:48,480 --> 02:20:50,820
Well, now that you know, aren't you going to answer him?

2320
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:52,000
Can you live up?

2321
02:20:52,540 --> 02:20:53,380
He said he can.

2322
02:20:53,700 --> 02:20:55,280
There's no way someone can live off that.

2323
02:20:55,360 --> 02:20:56,520
And I was like, oh no, that's my job.

2324
02:20:56,540 --> 02:20:58,020
And then he pulls up the channel.

2325
02:20:58,160 --> 02:20:59,560
He's still just like, there's no way.

2326
02:20:59,720 --> 02:21:00,620
No, no, no.

2327
02:21:00,680 --> 02:21:03,200
I was saying it after I looked at it.

2328
02:21:03,260 --> 02:21:03,960
I was like, oh, okay.

2329
02:21:05,220 --> 02:21:06,280
We'll play sometime.

2330
02:21:06,560 --> 02:21:06,900
We'll play sometime.

2331
02:21:08,360 --> 02:21:09,740
Okay, Jeff, hella.

2332
02:21:09,940 --> 02:21:10,980
I think I want to bend the hella.

2333
02:21:11,940 --> 02:21:12,960
Yeah, not Iron Fist.

2334
02:21:13,240 --> 02:21:13,540
There's no.

2335
02:21:13,860 --> 02:21:14,620
Oh, no, Iron Fist.

2336
02:21:15,280 --> 02:21:15,680
Yeah, that's good.

2337
02:21:15,740 --> 02:21:16,080
That's good.

2338
02:21:16,320 --> 02:21:17,460
This is why you got to walk in.

2339
02:21:17,460 --> 02:21:18,200
They banned Gambit.

2340
02:21:18,380 --> 02:21:18,680
We can protect.

2341
02:21:18,680 --> 02:21:19,240
What do you mean?

2342
02:21:19,440 --> 02:21:21,440
I've been hoping you retired Badline.

2343
02:21:22,120 --> 02:21:23,140
They banned Gambit.

2344
02:21:23,300 --> 02:21:23,560
We can protect.

2345
02:21:23,800 --> 02:21:24,480
We absolutely do.

2346
02:21:24,520 --> 02:21:25,240
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2347
02:21:25,260 --> 02:21:25,360
Okay.

2348
02:21:27,120 --> 02:21:37,800
okay who the heck come on lock in team lock in oh my god you
got your character oh let's go better carry moxie yeah very

2349
02:21:37,800 --> 02:21:47,480
carry you literally got that character now i better see you
like six days oh does that change the rest of our comp at

2350
02:21:47,480 --> 02:21:53,280
all if you're hawk right now no no you could play hawk out
any it's just easier to win against everyone else i think

2351
02:21:53,280 --> 02:22:04,040
yeah okay um i guess we we ban was it hello or jeff the
hello i think hell is more of an issue probably oh they just

2352
02:22:04,040 --> 02:22:11,520
don't want i mean unless you guys think triple support jeff
would be worse but no it's fine hello then and then we

2353
02:22:11,520 --> 02:22:14,540
protect venom if they don't ban we had we protect venom

2354
02:22:21,370 --> 02:22:26,250
and then jeff i'm a little rusty on the hawk ah bro stop it

2355
02:22:31,270 --> 02:22:34,070
He's giving himself a little backspace in case he gets
pooped on.

2356
02:22:34,550 --> 02:22:37,890
You've got to close your eyes right now and imagine yourself
playing the game, all right?

2357
02:22:38,050 --> 02:22:40,550
I need you to get that rust off before we even begin.

2358
02:22:40,770 --> 02:22:41,450
I like that.

2359
02:22:41,470 --> 02:22:42,310
It needs to happen.

2360
02:22:42,350 --> 02:22:42,710
I like that.

2361
02:22:42,810 --> 02:22:43,230
I like that.

2362
02:22:43,470 --> 02:22:44,750
Get warm in your mind.

2363
02:22:46,310 --> 02:22:47,230
Oh, they protected Punisher.

2364
02:22:47,450 --> 02:22:49,690
I guess that's Daltush's Punisher then.

2365
02:22:50,110 --> 02:22:50,290
Yeah.

2366
02:22:50,810 --> 02:22:51,670
And then Jeff.

2367
02:22:51,890 --> 02:22:52,070
That's fine.

2368
02:22:52,130 --> 02:22:53,930
We got a great Magneto then.

2369
02:22:54,210 --> 02:22:55,070
Yeah, I was going to say, just Mag.

2370
02:22:55,310 --> 02:22:55,930

02:22:55,930 --> 02:22:57,670
Mag, Luna, Sue.

2372
02:22:58,630 --> 02:22:59,230
Take care of you.

2373
02:22:59,530 --> 02:23:00,350
You want...

2374
02:23:00,350 --> 02:23:01,250

switch that up i think i think me yeah i mean you aim and

2377
02:23:15,610 --> 02:23:21,970
luna's more just raw aim and i think invis is just harder
like and has like a higher skill gap but honestly this

2378
02:23:21,970 --> 02:23:27,310
should be like i'm like 50 50 like they're like the same day
perfect if you're ready to switch back at any point let me

We haven't won a single game, but that doesn't matter
They're all laughing at us.

2384
02:23:56,750 --> 02:23:57,590
They're all making fun of us.

2385
02:23:57,870 --> 02:24:04,790
Here's where we shock the world I'm fucking shivering right
now.

2386
02:24:04,830 --> 02:24:05,250
That was good.

2387
02:24:05,470 --> 02:24:06,710
Jump high cops off if I don't like it.

2388
02:24:06,710 --> 02:24:07,290
Yeah, it's unguarded.

2389
02:24:07,530 --> 02:24:07,750
I got it.

2390
02:24:09,310 --> 02:24:10,930
I'm just going to stand on it so I can get it out.

2391
02:24:11,470 --> 02:24:11,490
Yeah.

2392
02:24:11,490 --> 02:24:13,650
Lock in team, let's go.

02:24:13,890 --> 02:24:13,990
Bumble.

2394
02:24:14,870 --> 02:24:16,170
Oh, there goes my jump back.

2395
02:24:16,470 --> 02:24:17,290
It starts with one, guys.

2396
02:24:17,410 --> 02:24:17,910
It starts with one.

2397
02:24:18,790 --> 02:24:20,110
The entertainment has arrived.

2398
02:24:20,670 --> 02:24:21,370
We got one.

2399
02:24:22,490 --> 02:24:23,470
We got one round, bro.

2400
02:24:23,850 --> 02:24:24,270
Yeah, exactly.

2401
02:24:24,270 --> 02:24:25,490
We're going to shock the world.

2402
02:24:26,670 --> 02:24:27,730
I thought we started.

2403
02:24:27,970 --> 02:24:29,190
Oh, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2404
02:24:31,270 --> 02:24:31,590
He missed.

2405
02:24:32,170 --> 02:24:32,430
He missed.

2406
02:24:32,550 --> 02:24:33,430
And he has no jump back anymore.

2407
02:24:33,590 --> 02:24:34,230
We can make burns.

2408
02:24:34,430 --> 02:24:34,670
Pass him maybe.

2409
02:24:35,010 --> 02:24:35,650
He's no passive.

2410
02:24:35,770 --> 02:24:36,110
No passive.

2411
02:24:37,010 --> 02:24:38,910
Oh, he's just saved his life.

2412
02:24:39,190 --> 02:24:40,530
Wolf and Hulk are one on this right side.

2413
02:24:40,550 --> 02:24:43,730
Oh, yeah.

2414
02:24:43,890 --> 02:24:44,010
Wolf.

2415
02:24:44,390 --> 02:24:44,430
Wolf.

2416
02:24:44,810 --> 02:24:44,930
Wolf.

2417
02:24:46,370 --> 02:24:47,130
He's still one.

2418
02:24:47,730 --> 02:24:48,310
He's still one.

2419
02:24:48,370 --> 02:24:48,810
He's still one.

2420
02:24:53,080 --> 02:24:54,700
This is an insane con from them.

2421
02:24:54,820 --> 02:24:55,200
I can't lie.

2422
02:24:58,740 --> 02:24:59,100
Armory one.

2423
02:24:59,180 --> 02:24:59,580
Armory one.

2424
02:24:59,720 --> 02:25:00,120
The supports are one.

2425
02:25:02,840 --> 02:25:03,200
Okay.

2426
02:25:03,220 --> 02:25:04,600
Nice swing, nice swing, Tyler.

2427
02:25:04,660 --> 02:25:05,460
Oh no, I couldn't get him.

2428
02:25:05,960 --> 02:25:06,400
We got the point.

2429
02:25:06,660 --> 02:25:10,120
It's fine, it's a trade, it's trade.

2430
02:25:10,400 --> 02:25:11,020
I'm shooting Punisher.

2431
02:25:11,720 --> 02:25:12,040
Yeah, I'm so.

2432
02:25:14,580 --> 02:25:15,440
I'm getting focused on you.

2433
02:25:15,460 --> 02:25:16,600
I'm right, I'm right, I'm getting right now.

2434
02:25:17,780 --> 02:25:18,120
I got you.

2435
02:25:18,120 --> 02:25:18,760
I killed Luna, I killed Luna.

2436
02:25:18,960 --> 02:25:19,680
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

2437
02:25:21,380 --> 02:25:22,060
He's fighting, he's fighting.

2438
02:25:22,380 --> 02:25:22,660
She had an ult.

2439
02:25:22,720 --> 02:25:23,780
She forced all I'm going to die in this.

2440
02:25:23,860 --> 02:25:24,420
Can someone heal me right now?

2441
02:25:24,560 --> 02:25:24,920
I'm trying to get out.

2442
02:25:24,980 --> 02:25:25,780
I got you, I got you, I got you, got you, got you.

2443
02:25:25,780 --> 02:25:26,440
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2444
02:25:27,480 --> 02:25:28,520
Oh no, it's back.

2445
02:25:29,420 --> 02:25:30,620
Yeah, if you can heal me, heal me, Doc.

2446
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:31,520
Yeah, I'll bubble you.

2447
02:25:31,520 --> 02:25:31,980
I got you.

2448
02:25:33,260 --> 02:25:34,440
Yeah, you follow yourself.

2449
02:25:34,600 --> 02:25:34,880
Good, good, good.

2450
02:25:35,420 --> 02:25:35,920
I have all here.

2451
02:25:36,660 --> 02:25:37,440
We don't need it.

2452
02:25:37,540 --> 02:25:37,840
We don't need it.

2453
02:25:37,840 --> 02:25:37,920
We don't need it.

2454
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:38,640
I pushed it.

2455
02:25:38,680 --> 02:25:38,980
I need your deck.

2456
02:25:39,780 --> 02:25:40,620
Everyone is right here, guys.

2457
02:25:40,880 --> 02:25:41,160
Hi.

2458
02:25:41,360 --> 02:25:41,840
Oh, we kill her.

2459
02:25:41,880 --> 02:25:43,980
Oh, you got her.

2460
02:25:44,240 --> 02:25:46,220
Dude, I think she was like gone around the corner.

2461
02:25:46,360 --> 02:25:46,700
Nice shot.

2462
02:25:46,880 --> 02:25:48,360
Yeah, I'm holding her on 100%.

2463
02:25:48,360 --> 02:25:50,740
I'll try to let you build a ult, but I have a ult too.

2464
02:25:51,460 --> 02:25:53,660
I might not be able to kill a pun with the ult, so we might
have to...

2465
02:25:53,660 --> 02:25:54,280
No, we use my ult.

2466
02:25:54,360 --> 02:25:54,700
We use my ult.

2467
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,200
Use your ult first, and then if you don't kill him, I'll use
my ul.

2468
02:25:57,560 --> 02:25:58,000
Yeah, yeah.

2469
02:25:58,140 --> 02:25:59,380
I'll see what I can get.

2470
02:25:59,540 --> 02:25:59,800
I agree.

2471
02:26:01,520 --> 02:26:02,520
I'm going to let you build out.

2472
02:26:03,020 --> 02:26:03,620
He's jumping around to you.

2473
02:26:03,720 --> 02:26:03,980
I got you.

2474
02:26:04,740 --> 02:26:05,020
Double nice.

2475
02:26:05,300 --> 02:26:07,760
Half can maybe die.

2476
02:26:07,880 --> 02:26:08,700
I mean, he's just up.

2477
02:26:10,040 --> 02:26:10,700
Go for the healers.

2478
02:26:11,860 --> 02:26:12,260
Yeah, I'm too.

2479
02:26:12,340 --> 02:26:14,120
I'm shooting the Luna in the back, Dolly.

2480
02:26:14,700 --> 02:26:15,860
Hey, I'm on some guy.

2481
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:16,260
I don't know.

2482
02:26:16,780 --> 02:26:17,540
You're on someone back there.

2483
02:26:17,620 --> 02:26:18,040
I'm shooting the Luna.

2484
02:26:18,220 --> 02:26:18,360
Luna on.

2485
02:26:18,940 --> 02:26:19,560
Their cap's low.

2486
02:26:19,780 --> 02:26:19,980
Cap's low.

2487
02:26:21,140 --> 02:26:21,420
Hey, man.

2488
02:26:21,420 --> 02:26:23,540
Let's get the cap.

2489
02:26:23,640 --> 02:26:23,960
Let's get the cap.

2490
02:26:31,510 --> 02:26:32,070
And you.

2491
02:26:33,030 --> 02:26:33,830
On me, on me, on me, on me, on me.

2492
02:26:34,750 --> 02:26:35,130
Caps you.

2493
02:26:35,650 --> 02:26:37,270
Punisher and Maitis are flanking left guys.

2494
02:26:37,350 --> 02:26:39,170
Yeah, yeah, three of them, three of them left.

2495
02:26:39,430 --> 02:26:40,690
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got the health.

2496
02:26:40,890 --> 02:26:41,770
Nice, good old, good old.

2497
02:26:42,070 --> 02:26:44,890
We're going to have to use Lintel for Punisher and...

2498
02:26:45,370 --> 02:26:46,590
Yeah, use it for Paul, use your pawn.

2499
02:26:46,890 --> 02:26:47,470
No, no, no, no.

2500
02:26:48,050 --> 02:26:48,630
Oh, no.

2501
02:26:48,630 --> 02:26:49,370
Oh, it's okay, I could...

2502
02:26:49,370 --> 02:26:50,110
Maitis dead, Maitis dead.

2503
02:26:50,830 --> 02:26:51,990
Oh, I actually pushed him away.

2504
02:26:52,330 --> 02:26:52,790
It's my bad.

2505
02:26:52,910 --> 02:26:53,570
I'm ultimately holding up.

2506
02:26:54,750 --> 02:26:55,750
I got pulled.

2507
02:26:56,010 --> 02:26:56,750
Altusia's right side.

2508
02:26:57,190 --> 02:26:57,510
He's...

2509
02:26:57,510 --> 02:26:57,910
No question.

2510
02:26:58,130 --> 02:26:58,790
Frozen in the middle.

2511
02:26:59,390 --> 02:27:00,470
Just Zion point, you have...

2512
02:27:00,470 --> 02:27:00,970
Cablo, Cablo.

2513
02:27:01,230 --> 02:27:01,670
I think we win.

2514
02:27:01,750 --> 02:27:02,170
I think we win.

2515
02:27:02,310 --> 02:27:02,850
It's half a night.

2516
02:27:02,850 --> 02:27:03,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2517
02:27:03,750 --> 02:27:04,250
And there's some wood.

2518
02:27:05,410 --> 02:27:06,230
We're coming back now.

2519
02:27:06,490 --> 02:27:06,870
I'm shooting Cavalry.

2520
02:27:06,970 --> 02:27:07,410
Capture Cavalry.

2521
02:27:07,930 --> 02:27:08,430
Just stay alive.

2522
02:27:08,850 --> 02:27:09,470
Stay alive.

2523
02:27:09,830 --> 02:27:10,130
Just careful.

2524
02:27:10,330 --> 02:27:11,390
Just play it back.

2525
02:27:11,590 --> 02:27:12,050
We're going to die.

2526
02:27:14,210 --> 02:27:14,850
They ulted nothing.

2527
02:27:14,950 --> 02:27:15,650
That's so good for us.

2528
02:27:16,350 --> 02:27:16,830
Magnetia, we?

2529
02:27:17,390 --> 02:27:18,090
No, no, no, no.

2530
02:27:18,470 --> 02:27:19,030
I'm cutting heals there.

2531
02:27:19,150 --> 02:27:20,570
I'm killing her.

2532
02:27:20,570 --> 02:27:20,650

02:30:32,750 --> 02:30:33,410
There's mag here.

2600
02:30:34,090 --> 02:30:34,630
How did you get here?

2601
02:30:35,270 --> 02:30:37,210
Cat, cat, cat, cat, cat.

2602
02:30:37,770 --> 02:30:39,290
I'm still saving all for pawn.

2603
02:30:39,370 --> 02:30:40,290
They might rock it with it though.

2604
02:30:40,470 --> 02:30:42,010
Yeah, yeah, just save it for him.

2605
02:30:42,210 --> 02:30:43,690
I'll ult it all the way.

2606
02:30:44,090 --> 02:30:44,570
Walk back.

2607
02:30:44,930 --> 02:30:45,390
I'm a wall.

2608
02:30:45,550 --> 02:30:45,970
Someone on the road.

2609
02:30:46,270 --> 02:30:46,970
Oh yeah, I need help.

2610
02:30:49,090 --> 02:30:50,210
I need help.

2611
02:30:50,290 --> 02:30:50,950
Keep me up right now.

2612
02:30:51,730 --> 02:30:53,090
I didn't, I got hit by something.

2613
02:30:53,670 --> 02:30:55,110
Yeah, yeah, just down point, down point.

2614
02:30:55,550 --> 02:30:57,110
I got hit on the plank.

2615
02:30:59,110 --> 02:31:01,670
You captured more than half of the missionary family.

2616
02:31:01,930 --> 02:31:02,310
Keep going.

2617
02:31:02,490 --> 02:31:02,590
Okay.

2618
02:31:02,850 --> 02:31:03,450
I'm fine.

2619
02:31:04,710 --> 02:31:05,270
That's so good.

2620
02:31:05,350 --> 02:31:05,610
That's so good.

2621
02:31:05,730 --> 02:31:08,070
We got good momentum here.

2622
02:31:09,130 --> 02:31:09,770
Out of flake.

2623
02:31:10,690 --> 02:31:11,650
I like the cold.

2624
02:31:11,990 --> 02:31:12,790
I was at my lot too.

2625
02:31:13,010 --> 02:31:13,150
Just calm.

2626
02:31:13,290 --> 02:31:14,310
Calm when you're going in, Tyler.

2627
02:31:14,550 --> 02:31:16,510
We're not there actually.

2628
02:31:16,690 --> 02:31:17,030
We're not there.

2629
02:31:17,150 --> 02:31:17,490
We're not there.

2630
02:31:17,550 --> 02:31:17,930
We're not there.

2631
02:31:18,410 --> 02:31:18,470
We're not.

2632
02:31:18,470 --> 02:31:20,330
He's lying, he's lying, dude.

2633
02:31:20,870 --> 02:31:21,710
He's lying, dude.

2634
02:31:21,710 --> 02:31:22,350
The Punisher's just holding it.

2635
02:31:22,490 --> 02:31:22,650
I'm in.

2636
02:31:22,950 --> 02:31:23,890
The Punisher's going for you.

2637
02:31:25,830 --> 02:31:26,530
Come on, boy.

2638
02:31:27,430 --> 02:31:28,130
Hey, yeah, yeah.

2639

We're here now.

2641
02:31:32,330 --> 02:31:32,910
Rocket, Rocket Week.

2642
02:31:33,370 --> 02:31:34,090
Rocket Week, running back.

2643
02:31:34,870 --> 02:31:35,350

Kill him.

2651
02:31:42,330 --> 02:31:43,730
No bubble.

2652
02:31:43,810 --> 02:31:44,410
Stand behind me if you need.

2653
02:31:44,990 --> 02:31:45,550
Oh, he threw already.

2654
02:31:47,210 --> 02:31:48,530
Fight point, fight point, fight point.

2655
02:31:49,270 --> 02:31:49,550
Nice.

2656
02:31:50,310 --> 02:31:50,850

2657
02:31:50,990 --> 02:31:51,850

I'll let you farm all day.

2661
02:31:55,010 --> 02:31:55,670

02:31:59,170 --> 02:32:00,250
I'm in here.

2664
02:32:00,370 --> 02:32:00,990
You gotta yell louder.

2665
02:32:01,130 --> 02:32:02,010
You gotta yell louder.

2666
02:32:02,430 --> 02:32:02,750
Okay.

2667
02:32:02,970 --> 02:32:03,570
I will scream.

2668
02:32:03,670 --> 02:32:04,250
Heal Moxie.

2669
02:32:04,730 --> 02:32:05,090
That's okay.

2670
02:32:05,270 --> 02:32:05,630
I got Moxie.

2671
02:32:05,890 --> 02:32:07,790
Yeah, we should be fine now.

2672
02:32:07,890 --> 02:32:09,030

I'm dead.

2730
02:34:00,720 --> 02:34:01,320
He's gonna die.

2731
02:34:02,280 --> 02:34:02,320
Yeah.

2732
02:34:02,320 --> 02:34:02,500
Yeah.

2733
02:34:03,340 --> 02:34:03,780
They're porling.

2734
02:34:03,880 --> 02:34:04,240
They're porling.

2735
02:34:04,360 --> 02:34:04,620
They're porling.

2736
02:34:04,760 --> 02:34:05,060
They're porling.

2737
02:34:06,160 --> 02:34:06,780
Kill that all day.

2738
02:34:06,940 --> 02:34:07,500
Come on!

2739
02:34:10,080 --> 02:34:11,060
Oh my God.

2740
02:34:11,960 --> 02:34:12,300
Wait a minute.

2741
02:34:12,500 --> 02:34:16,900
Did you feel like you were cooking, Tyler, with the new
tech, with the swing, the new swing test?

2742
02:34:16,920 --> 02:34:17,040
I'm going to be honest.

2743
02:34:17,120 --> 02:34:18,160
I did it like three times.

2744
02:34:18,300 --> 02:34:19,220
I can't climb walls.

2745
02:34:19,320 --> 02:34:20,340
I don't know if the top walls are me.

2746
02:34:21,560 --> 02:34:23,900
I'm like, you know, stun locks are running backwards and
running.

2747
02:34:23,960 --> 02:34:24,820
It is a little goofy.

2748
02:34:25,080 --> 02:34:28,060
But once you get that wall climb, it is the move.

2749
02:34:29,440 --> 02:34:30,700
I died a lot less this game.

2750
02:34:30,720 --> 02:34:33,520
game because I was running away instead of just dying.

2751
02:34:34,220 --> 02:34:34,520
That's good.

2752
02:34:34,760 --> 02:34:34,940
That's good.

2753
02:34:35,200 --> 02:34:37,440
That game felt 500 times easier than ever.

2754
02:34:37,740 --> 02:34:39,620
Yeah, I think we got the car.

2755
02:34:40,120 --> 02:34:41,950
Yeah, those guys were just...

2756
02:34:42,400 --> 02:34:46,460
Those guys were just as equally good as everyone else.

2757
02:34:46,680 --> 02:34:48,100
I think also because Moxie had Hawkeye.

2758
02:34:48,840 --> 02:34:49,220
Yeah.

2759
02:34:49,380 --> 02:34:51,300
The Hawkeye Jeff is definitely present.

2760
02:34:53,200 --> 02:34:53,800
No, no.

2761
02:34:54,440 --> 02:34:57,100
I think the Hawkeye is definitely helping us a lot.

2762
02:34:57,820 --> 02:35:07,560
Listen, if that's also, if that's Rusty, Moxie, that the
rust is gone right oh right now that now that they let marxي

We...

2773
02:35:47,880 --> 02:35:49,520
Not full sweep.

2774
02:36:02,120 --> 02:36:04,340
Yeah, no Doom Q later.

2775
02:36:04,380 --> 02:36:06,200
Guys, we can't even Doom Q if we want to.

2776
02:36:07,880 --> 02:36:09,080
We have to.

2777
02:36:09,560 --> 02:36:10,160
We have to.

2778
02:36:10,240 --> 02:36:10,900
We have gotta win.

2779
02:36:10,920 --> 02:36:18,060
war oh did i say oh yeah by the way i don't remember if i
talked about chibi-doki message me last night and apparently

2780
02:36:18,060 --> 02:36:24,120
she's really sick like she had to go to a hospital because
of her throat um i assume because like you know she screams

2781
02:36:24,120 --> 02:36:33,300
a lot so like i worry about her health but um unfortunately
because of that the doctor said that she should like rest up

2782
02:36:33,300 --> 02:36:40,040
and not use her voice too much um and uh So we're going to
reschedule tomorrow's collab.

2783
02:36:40,680 --> 02:36:41,780
Yeah, I hope she's okay.

2784
02:36:41,940 --> 02:36:43,180
I do hope she's okay.

2785
02:36:43,700 --> 02:36:45,120
But we are rescheduling.

2786
02:36:45,560 --> 02:36:50,600
We'll be rescheduling tomorrow's collab to another day
whenever she feels better.

2787
02:36:51,500 --> 02:36:59,260
So most likely tomorrow, either I take a day off because I
also need to rest my voice as well.

2788
02:37:00,300 --> 02:37:07,020
Or maybe we put, depending on how long I'm playing rivals.

2789
02:37:07,040 --> 02:37:09,380
We pushed God of War to tomorrow.

2790
02:37:10,080 --> 02:37:11,060
So we'll see how it is.

2791
02:37:11,220 --> 02:37:11,940
We'll see how it goes.

2792
02:37:23,160 --> 02:37:24,640
Oh, we were supposed to...

2793
02:37:24,640 --> 02:37:25,380
Okay, then.

2794
02:37:27,220 --> 02:37:28,300
Yeah, so...

2795
02:37:28,300 --> 02:37:28,880
Let's see.

2796
02:37:31,880 --> 02:37:32,960
Oh, yeah.

2797
02:37:33,360 --> 02:37:35,380
Apparently we're supposed to leave the lobby.

2798
02:37:35,700 --> 02:37:37,240
For those who are still over here.

2799
02:37:38,080 --> 02:37:38,420

2800
02:37:38,680 --> 02:37:39,460

2801
02:37:39,460 --> 02:37:39,740
Yeah.

2802
02:37:39,940 --> 02:37:41,220
They invited us to a new lobby.

2803
02:37:42,300 --> 02:37:42,880
Oh, okay.

2804
02:37:43,240 --> 02:37:43,840

02:37:52,530 --> 02:37:53,070
Yeah.

2806
02:37:53,410 --> 02:37:59,050
So, we'll see how I feel after the tournament's been really
fun so far.

2810
02:38:06,510 --> 02:38:08,590
I like the vibes of this team.

2811
02:38:15,130 --> 02:38:17,210
Yeah, it's been silly.

2812
02:38:30,430 --> 02:38:31,790
Tyler Crashout.

2813
02:38:32,610 --> 02:38:35,050
Tyler Crashout is...

2814
02:38:39,630 --> 02:38:48,330
Tyler crashing out is like is like literally the the theme

02:39:02,040 --> 02:39:04,700

It's been fun.

2823
02:40:39,830 --> 02:40:43,930
It was really hard in the beginning, only because of
micromanaging everyone.

2824
02:40:45,130 --> 02:40:46,270
Because I didn't change the way.

2825
02:40:46,730 --> 02:40:54,690
I don't know if you guys hear me stumbling in my calls a
lot, because I have to try to change the way I say, stuff

2826
02:40:54,690 --> 02:41:03,630
because like they're like we do have like three new players
three newer players on our team so like i'm like what do i

2833
02:42:38,680 --> 02:42:44,580

who's the last team we're playing against tyler's probably

2834
02:42:44,580 --> 02:42:50,020
hitting the practice range right now making sure his venom
movement's good yeah i'm 100 out of it actually moxie thanks

2835
02:42:50,020 --> 02:42:59,000
for asking piece of of you know why would you say that
because we all know he is doing it anyway so you Why is it?

2836
02:42:59,040 --> 02:42:59,680
I'm going to speed up it.

2837
02:42:59,760 --> 02:43:01,160
I just did some practice tool.

2838
02:43:01,440 --> 02:43:03,240
Plus, I was on Google looking at combos.

2839
02:43:03,740 --> 02:43:04,220
Oh, yeah.

2840
02:43:04,500 --> 02:43:04,820
Oh, wait.

2841
02:43:05,100 --> 02:43:06,260
What combo did you learn?

2842
02:43:06,840 --> 02:43:07,580
I was just about to tell you.

2843
02:43:07,980 --> 02:43:11,220
My, so first of all, I know my auto attacks now do
percentage health damage.

2844
02:43:11,720 --> 02:43:16,380
So the combo is get on a wall, F down.

2845
02:43:19,200 --> 02:43:19,440
Uh-huh.

2846
02:43:20,420 --> 02:43:21,720
Left click, left click.

2847
02:43:24,160 --> 02:43:26,840
Q, Q or something.

2848
02:43:26,940 --> 02:43:27,780
You slam down.

2849
02:43:28,180 --> 02:43:31,800
You press right click, you hit two left clicks, and then you
press alt immediately.

2850
02:43:32,460 --> 02:43:32,860
I was close!

2851
02:43:33,100 --> 02:43:33,920
See, I told you!

2852
02:43:33,960 --> 02:43:34,900
And you said I wasn't practicing!

2853
02:43:35,500 --> 02:43:41,060
Yeah, but the right click is the big thing, because if you
right click and your alt pop at the same time, it's a

2854
02:43:41,060 --> 02:43:43,500
one-shot, if it's damage-boosted.

2855
02:43:45,540 --> 02:43:46,860
My right click slows, right?

2856
02:43:47,840 --> 02:43:50,420
It slows, and when it pops, it does damage.

2857
02:43:50,660 --> 02:43:51,680
Max HP damage.

2858
02:43:52,280 --> 02:43:52,500
Gotcha.

2859
02:43:55,480 --> 02:43:56,120
Alright, anyway.

2860
02:43:56,260 --> 02:43:56,680
Good shit, dude.

2861
02:43:56,740 --> 02:43:57,080
Good shit.

2862
02:43:57,140 --> 02:43:57,400
Let's go.

2863
02:43:57,420 --> 02:43:58,140
That's how we play.

2864
02:43:59,940 --> 02:44:09,540
nine moxie because we're playing i'm trying to figure out
this team wait are we playing a super team right yeah only

2865
02:44:09,540 --> 02:44:19,600
team we haven't versed i think okay um well do we they're
playing triple support so should we their weakest players

2866
02:44:19,600 --> 02:44:34,260
are support players do we ban rocket i think so yeah we
first ban rocket and then do we want to keep invid do we

2867
02:44:34,260 --> 02:44:35,940
want to keep loki or not

2868
02:44:40,380 --> 02:44:50,400
because i can run invis luna again do they have a loki
player they do that was a good it worked the last game they

2869
02:44:50,400 --> 02:44:55,520
do they have they're running rocket loki invis yeah

2870
02:44:59,960 --> 02:45:06,720
their two supports are rocket and their their support
players are rocket loki and invis and they run they're

2871
02:45:06,720 --> 02:45:24,830
running okay yeah we could ban that kind of want to know
what everyone else banned versus them

2872
02:45:33,100 --> 02:45:41,580
no way dude these guys are so sweaty they private at all
their profiles just just watch their streams i know like

2873
02:45:41,580 --> 02:45:46,740
your stream mother fuckers like that

2874
02:45:56,180 --> 02:46:10,360
i'll look at i can pull up one of their streams okay they
they what okay they got hot guys strange wolf that was what

2875
02:46:10,360 --> 02:46:12,880
the enemy team banned for them

2876
02:46:20,200 --> 02:46:28,900
wait does that mean they want hawkaii because yeah but then
we'll see how they play that's good for us if we get hawkaii

2877
02:46:28,900 --> 02:46:31,380
hawkaii i'll take it i believe in moxie

2878
02:46:35,480 --> 02:46:42,380
dude all of them private in their profiles they want to win
win Yeah, no, they won't really want to win-win.

2879
02:46:45,540 --> 02:46:46,980
Yeah, they protect Rocket, by the way.

2880
02:46:47,140 --> 02:46:48,360
So we should just first ban Rocket.

2881
02:46:51,930 --> 02:46:52,670
Yeah, I agree.

2882
02:46:57,440 --> 02:46:59,640
They protect Strange and Rocket.

2883
02:47:00,240 --> 02:47:01,440
So we could ban a Strange.

2884
02:47:01,840 --> 02:47:04,340
Because Super is good at Strange.

2885
02:47:06,380 --> 02:47:09,280
They protect Rocket, Loki.

2886
02:47:11,560 --> 02:47:24,760
We could do Loki, Rocket, and strange okay we do rocket then
strange then loki and if they protect adder one we just add

2887
02:47:24,760 --> 02:47:34,780
another support in there because they run triple support
yeah zoil play strange that's probably why this is most

2888
02:47:34,780 --> 02:47:45,760
played by a lot they always they always protect either loki
or strange so protect rocket and then we can just first ban

2889
02:47:45,760 --> 02:47:57,120
rocket and then they would protect loki or strange for the
next one so we just try to follow that should we i'm down

2890
02:47:57,120 --> 02:48:05,280
ban the strange and then i'll go moon knight and just try
and farm off the clones we can do that yeah okay yeah we try

2891
02:48:05,280 --> 02:48:13,600
strange that's cooking just in like the second easiest
support that they could play because i know like Because

2892
02:48:13,600 --> 02:48:15,900
apparently Lydia is the rocket player.

2893
02:48:16,320 --> 02:48:18,100
So I assume like she hasn't learned the other supports.

2894
02:48:20,780 --> 02:48:22,060
Yeah, I've only seen her really play rocket.

2895
02:48:23,180 --> 02:48:24,520
And like there's no really...

2896
02:48:24,520 --> 02:48:25,220
The only ease...

2897
02:48:25,220 --> 02:48:26,300
Is their profile private?

2898
02:48:29,760 --> 02:48:31,940
Um, well, they've been first...

2899
02:48:31,940 --> 02:48:34,760
They've been first protecting rocket the entire tournament.

2900
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:36,360
So I just assume it's for her.

2901
02:48:38,800 --> 02:48:39,760
Um, and...

2902
02:48:39,760 --> 02:48:42,400
And the second easiest support to play is cloak and dagger.

2903
02:48:43,520 --> 02:48:49,960
Mag that fully counters Cloak and that fully counters her
because I don't think she would if she never really played

2904
02:48:49,960 --> 02:48:51,800
Cloak and Dagger I don't think she would know how to hide

2905
02:48:55,780 --> 02:48:56,800
does she play Cloak?

2906
02:48:57,540 --> 02:49:03,760
I don't know like that would I would give her the Cloak as
the second play character for her to play because what else

2907
02:49:03,760 --> 02:49:05,360
would she play other than Rocket

2908
02:49:16,010 --> 02:49:21,650
whoa Moxie is the static from your end oh that might be yeah
I'm holding on for a stock oops oh

2909
02:49:28,510 --> 02:49:30,130
and so we're playing Super Yeah.

2910
02:49:30,870 --> 02:49:31,810
Wait, who won?

2911
02:49:33,490 --> 02:49:34,730
I think they lost.

2912
02:49:35,810 --> 02:49:36,870
Yeah, I think so.

2913
02:49:37,070 --> 02:49:37,770
Oh yeah, they did.

2914
02:49:37,870 --> 02:49:38,930
They lost to Erob.

2915
02:49:40,770 --> 02:49:41,570
Tyler won.

2916
02:49:41,650 --> 02:49:43,050
Hey, you're not the only team that lost.

2917
02:49:43,150 --> 02:49:44,770
We're not the only team that lost to him.

2918
02:49:46,110 --> 02:49:47,070
Yeah, Erob's 3-0.

2919
02:49:47,370 --> 02:49:47,690
Yeah.

2920
02:49:48,930 --> 02:49:51,370
So like super lost to Erob too.

2921
02:49:53,450 --> 02:49:54,250
That's not bad.

2922
02:49:54,430 --> 02:49:55,950
Yeah, that should be...

2923
02:49:55,950 --> 02:49:57,430
That's pretty good feeling.

2924
02:49:58,150 --> 02:49:59,170
And we come back too.

2925
02:50:07,120 --> 02:50:14,360

2926
02:50:14,360 --> 02:50:15,280
the lobby

2927
02:50:47,850 --> 02:51:04,030

2936
02:51:27,530 --> 02:51:28,170
What are you missing?

2937
02:51:29,570 --> 02:51:32,790

02:51:35,110 --> 02:51:36,610
And then if we lose the next one, we're out.

2941
02:51:36,630 --> 02:51:39,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's best of three there.

2942
02:51:40,490 --> 02:51:41,070
Oh shit.

2943
02:51:41,270 --> 02:51:41,650
It's getting real.

2944
02:51:41,950 --> 02:51:45,910
No, it's not it wasn't it's not best of one Yeah, yeah, best
of one.

2945
02:51:47,930 --> 02:51:51,530
So so we could yeah, like maybe finals is the best of three
only.

2946
02:51:51,930 --> 02:52:00,150
Yeah, yes So we can literally get kicked out right after No,
when money's wrong mindset we could kick another team out.

2947
02:52:00,370 --> 02:52:00,710
That's true.

2948
02:52:00,770 --> 02:52:01,170
That's true.

2949
02:52:01,670 --> 02:52:08,110
Yeah, yeah, come on I already I already DM'd all the
captains Hawkeye should be good Let's fucking go.

2950
02:52:08,350 --> 02:52:09,250
We're all ready, right?

2951
02:52:10,150 --> 02:52:11,010
I think so.

2952
02:52:11,390 --> 02:52:11,630
Okay.

2953
02:52:12,070 --> 02:52:12,350
R.

2954
02:52:13,130 --> 02:52:14,450
I wrote R for us.

2955
02:52:15,370 --> 02:52:15,470
Yep.

2956
02:52:16,230 --> 02:52:17,270
You guys are grandmasters?

2957
02:52:17,590 --> 02:52:18,590
How do we ever lose?

2958
02:52:22,970 --> 02:52:24,030
Rank just reset.

2959
02:52:24,290 --> 02:52:26,050
So, like, most people that are looking at...

2960
02:52:26,790 --> 02:52:28,890
Well, we also got two people not placed, you know?

2961
02:52:29,010 --> 02:52:29,950
Yeah, yeah, see?

2962
02:52:30,530 --> 02:52:34,670
Like, the enemy team has all their teams placed.

2963
02:52:34,850 --> 02:52:36,510
But our team has two people running.

2964
02:52:36,630 --> 02:52:46,270
play silver maxi i can't throw me in silver nah epic you're
at least gold plow i can get grandmaster in a month by the

2965
02:52:46,270 --> 02:52:53,690
way oh you want to bet how much um well you're a millionaire

downside of holding like i'm shuddering sorry what is the

2974
02:53:51,450 --> 02:53:58,430
downside of holding left click there's no downside why would
i want to miss 100 of the shots you don't take that's true

2975

Yeah, yeah, like the, like, left click melee at the, like,
every time you hit.

Guys, I, I, guys, we're only confusing him more.

2981
02:54:20,950 --> 02:54:21,970
He's going to take more.

02:54:22,230 --> 02:54:24,690
I'm like, I'm watching.

2983
02:54:24,690 --> 02:54:27,630
Gingy, he's just going to start overthinking, guys.

2984
02:54:31,790 --> 02:54:32,510
Guys, not five.

2985
02:54:32,610 --> 02:54:33,670
We're not overwhelming him.

2986
02:54:36,070 --> 02:54:36,610
Let's not.

2987
02:54:36,630 --> 02:54:37,870
talking about like he's not here.

2988
02:54:38,070 --> 02:54:39,150
He's like right here.

02:54:39,150 --> 02:54:39,850
Dude, what the fuck?

Okay, Tyler, protect.

3002
02:54:58,030 --> 02:54:59,710
Okay, Tyler, protect, okay, we're gonna see what they banned
first.

3003
02:55:00,970 --> 02:55:02,150
They're not gonna be in Hawkeye, trust me.

3004
02:55:02,450 --> 02:55:02,930
Search bar?

3005
02:55:03,630 --> 02:55:04,670
Protect Holokai now.

3006
02:55:05,050 --> 02:55:05,550
No, no, no, no.

3007
02:55:06,130 --> 02:55:13,070
start looking for hawkaii yeah start looking for hawkaii
it's on the bottom row you tell me where he's at bottom row

3008
02:55:13,070 --> 02:55:22,530
bottom row on the dps section he's blonde he's got a purple
mask on his face okay protect your venom okay yeah protect

3009
02:55:22,530 --> 02:55:31,370
venom and then oh we're re-banning after that it's not you
yet they've got a wait wait moxie were we next again i

3010
02:55:31,370 --> 02:55:41,370
forgot uh strange strange or strange yeah uh protect venom
and then ban strange okay which heroes will get my cosmic

3011
02:55:41,370 --> 02:55:42,290
favor today

3012
02:55:45,410 --> 02:55:55,690
and then strange yeah nice okay why are we protecting now
we're doing vibes now what's my base protections okay

3013
02:55:55,690 --> 02:56:01,810
because like our second protect never usually doesn't matter
we can

3014
02:56:08,750 --> 02:56:18,250
protect anything that moxie wants to wants to flex me from
hawkeye what do you want to go bucky then protect bucky

3015
02:56:18,250 --> 02:56:26,430
protect bucky yeah dps yeah bucky they banned our top row
top row winter soldier yep oh we're done for they've been

3016
02:56:26,430 --> 02:56:31,690
iron fist what do we bend last uh loki loki Loki.

3017
02:56:32,350 --> 02:56:36,930
I feel like protect Bucky and then, oh, they protected Loki.

3018
02:56:37,530 --> 02:56:37,550
Okay.

3019
02:56:38,070 --> 02:56:38,370
That's fine.

3020
02:56:38,510 --> 02:56:38,750
That's fine.

3021
02:56:38,950 --> 02:56:39,230
Yeah.

3022
02:56:39,990 --> 02:56:40,810
Are we doing Moon Knight then?

3023
02:56:41,370 --> 02:56:43,070
And then we, yeah, we can do Moon Knight.

3024
02:56:43,690 --> 02:56:45,590
And then we, we banned Cloak.

3025
02:56:46,310 --> 02:56:46,890
Or Mantis.

3026
02:56:47,090 --> 02:56:48,070
They played Mantis as well.

3027
02:56:48,550 --> 02:56:51,010
So I think Cloak and Bag are on the support.

3028
02:56:52,590 --> 02:56:52,930
All right.

3029
02:56:52,950 --> 02:56:56,310
I feel like that would leave one pretty cool.

3030
02:56:56,470 --> 02:56:56,670
Oh yeah.

3031
02:56:56,950 --> 02:56:56,970
Yeah.

3032
02:56:57,150 --> 02:56:59,770
So because then she will have to play a harder support now.

3033
02:56:59,950 --> 02:57:00,870
She might have to play a Jeff.

3034
02:57:02,130 --> 02:57:11,870
most likely so I'm gonna switch to moon night yeah you swap
to moon night yeah all right and then we can do we'll do in

3035
02:57:11,870 --> 02:57:23,030
this Luna I think in this Luna is stronger than I mean in
this lucky is stronger but I think like we are very good

3036
02:57:23,030 --> 02:57:29,290
with in this Luna I wasn't here for when we were going over
like their comp fully Should I go Mag or Gurd?

3037
02:57:29,490 --> 02:57:29,810
Mag.

3038
02:57:30,550 --> 02:57:30,750
Mag?

3039
02:57:31,110 --> 02:57:31,690
Yeah, yeah.

3040
02:57:33,370 --> 02:57:35,670
Most likely, Super is going to go Mag.

3041
02:57:37,310 --> 02:57:37,450
Bye-bye.

3042
02:57:38,070 --> 02:57:38,070
All

3043
02:57:42,320 --> 02:57:44,940
right, guys.

3044
02:57:45,200 --> 02:57:47,020
If we head into the playoffs, 2-0.

3045
02:57:47,800 --> 02:57:48,520
I think 2-0 in a row.

3046
02:57:48,620 --> 02:57:49,380
Who's going to stop us?

3047
02:57:49,720 --> 02:57:50,060
Yes, sir.

3048
02:57:50,280 --> 02:57:50,420
2-0.

3049
02:57:50,900 --> 02:57:51,980
We'll be on a hot streak?

3050
02:57:52,680 --> 02:57:53,260
Yeah, we're there.

3051
02:57:54,640 --> 02:57:56,020
We're more versus the top two teams.

3052
02:57:56,160 --> 02:57:57,700
We're versus one of these that we just beat.

3053
02:57:58,080 --> 02:57:58,400
Oh, really?

3054
02:57:58,480 --> 02:57:59,140
You guys hear mine.

3055
02:57:59,480 --> 02:58:01,040
Yeah, the first and second get a buy.

3056
02:58:01,240 --> 02:58:02,000
No, we don't shoot.

3057
02:58:02,100 --> 02:58:03,660
Oh, thank goodness.

3058
02:58:04,840 --> 02:58:07,960
Because he might start, you might start hearing him a
little.

3059
02:58:08,660 --> 02:58:09,360
It's all good, bro.

3060
02:58:09,660 --> 02:58:13,460
No, I said like the third easiest support that she could
play is Jeff.

3061
02:58:14,340 --> 02:58:15,980
All right, so I'm gonna die a lot less this game.

3062
02:58:16,420 --> 02:58:17,960
That's why I still, I passed it.

3063
02:58:18,500 --> 02:58:18,880
Oh, nice.

3064
02:58:19,100 --> 02:58:19,840
Were you messing with it?

3065
02:58:19,960 --> 02:58:20,460
Between game?

3066
02:58:20,500 --> 02:58:20,880
Yeah, I was.

3067
02:58:21,260 --> 02:58:21,660
That's big.

3068
02:58:22,960 --> 02:58:24,220
All right, here we go.

3069
02:58:26,760 --> 02:58:27,520
Super block?

3070
02:58:27,860 --> 02:58:28,340
Oh, they do.

3071
02:58:28,480 --> 02:58:28,940
They do.

3072
02:58:29,080 --> 02:58:30,400
They have their own teammate blocked.

3073
02:58:32,680 --> 02:58:39,800
all you need to do is capture the missionary their low-key
might start like my dps so we gotta be careful oh really

3074
02:58:39,800 --> 02:58:53,580
yeah i think it's i think it's sleepy and i know sleepy
likes to thank dps as the key go all right here oh my god i

keep you up.

3077
02:59:21,980 --> 02:59:24,100
Yeah, I can get on point again, but Emma's kind of bullying
me a little bit.

3078
02:59:24,400 --> 02:59:25,880
Yeah, I'm trying my best to keep you up.

3079
02:59:26,100 --> 02:59:26,400

Yeah, Emma is just like, yeah, thank you.

3081
02:59:29,720 --> 02:59:32,900
Yeah, we have to die on point.

3082
02:59:33,480 --> 02:59:34,340
I'm going to just die here.

3083
02:59:35,580 --> 02:59:36,740
Their comp is super solid.

3084
02:59:37,940 --> 02:59:39,300
Yeah, they're running triple support.

3085
02:59:40,140 --> 02:59:41,300
Oh, I'm just getting melted, by the way.

3086
02:59:43,500 --> 02:59:43,740
Fall back.

3087
02:59:45,600 --> 02:59:47,760
We have a bucky out here.

3088
02:59:48,640 --> 02:59:49,900
up so easily.

3089
02:59:52,700 --> 02:59:54,760
I'm holding back.

3090
02:59:57,290 --> 02:59:58,210
I'm shooting punch you with you.

Breaking land, breaking land.

3103
03:00:09,410 --> 03:00:09,810
Go, kill it.

Actually, Mac, you try first for Punisher.

3121
03:00:31,750 --> 03:00:33,250

Yeah, yeah.

3123
03:00:33,750 --> 03:00:36,310
And then Luna, you just do for other alts.

3124
03:00:36,430 --> 03:00:37,330
Just don't do it for Punisher.

3125
03:00:38,110 --> 03:00:38,870
What's Punisher's line?

3126
03:00:40,310 --> 03:00:40,990

the best support i'd be i'd be too crazy if i had some time

3586
03:16:21,270 --> 03:16:28,130
but you'd be one above it's also like it's hard to like
practice even for these to have attorneys because like i

3597
03:17:46,150 --> 03:17:46,650
massive.

3598
03:17:46,730 --> 03:17:47,690
Wait, no, we could win.

3599
03:17:47,910 --> 03:17:48,130
We're fourth place.

3600
03:17:48,350 --> 03:17:48,390
Sorry.

3601
03:17:48,450 --> 03:17:48,890
What is that?

3602
03:17:49,210 --> 03:17:50,430
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

3603
03:17:52,390 --> 03:17:53,450
That doesn't matter right now.

3604
03:17:53,570 --> 03:17:55,330
I think first and second got to buy.

3605
03:17:55,790 --> 03:17:55,930
Yep.

3606
03:17:56,030 --> 03:17:58,630
So that means we are the second best team left.

3607
03:17:58,910 --> 03:18:01,510
So we're versing the fifth place team.

3608
03:18:01,510 --> 03:18:02,090
Yeah, yeah.

3609
03:18:02,250 --> 03:18:02,770
Right below us.

3610
03:18:02,790 --> 03:18:03,510
Wait, who's the fifth place?

3611
03:18:04,410 --> 03:18:05,330
What is their record?

3612
03:18:05,590 --> 03:18:06,190
We just beat, I think.

3613
03:18:06,490 --> 03:18:07,490
We're up against them again.

3614
03:18:07,510 --> 03:18:08,930
No, it's not Super Steam.

3615
03:18:09,090 --> 03:18:10,490
Super Steam is with us.

3616
03:18:10,590 --> 03:18:11,130
He's two, three.

3617
03:18:11,910 --> 03:18:12,430
So it's either...

3618
03:18:12,430 --> 03:18:14,470

3622
03:18:42,190 --> 03:18:52,690
one of five or something be it are the only teams that are
below us oh uh so yeah i mean we just one of them i think we

3623
03:18:52,690 --> 03:18:56,850
just are running it back with uh if flats is definitely last
then we're definitely playing yeah so we're playing super

3624
03:18:56,850 --> 03:19:07,130
again and we just keep the same calm bear in mind it's not
gonna be domination anymore so wait it's not domination no i

3625
03:19:07,130 --> 03:19:18,190
i don't believe so i could be wrong when i was reading the
rules it not yeah yeah is there like any changes we should

3626
03:19:18,190 --> 03:19:28,310
make to i don't know is there like tech that we can put down
while we're waiting i don't know put some petty mines down

3627
03:19:28,310 --> 03:19:33,990
or something i don't know you need some kidnaps but i'm not
that good at kidnapping a strange okay if we could i think

3628
03:19:33,990 --> 03:19:36,130
penny would be great Yeah.

3629
03:19:36,650 --> 03:19:38,690
I don't have a penny in my bag either.

3630
03:19:40,210 --> 03:19:40,610
Well.

3631
03:19:40,810 --> 03:19:41,930
Like one of the only tanks I don't play.

3632
03:19:42,150 --> 03:19:43,490
Tyler probably can just pick it up.

3633
03:19:43,770 --> 03:19:44,150
No, no.

3634
03:19:44,410 --> 03:19:44,990
Remember what we said?

3635
03:19:45,070 --> 03:19:46,390
We could probably pick up rocket.

3636
03:19:46,750 --> 03:19:47,350
No, no, no.

3637
03:19:47,450 --> 03:19:47,870
We know what.

3638
03:19:47,970 --> 03:19:48,550
You didn't pick up rocket.

3639
03:19:48,850 --> 03:19:49,470
It just didn't go well.

3640
03:19:49,550 --> 03:19:50,170
You picked it up though.

3641
03:19:50,370 --> 03:19:52,170
No, it did great, Tyler.

3642
03:19:52,350 --> 03:19:52,590
It did great.

3643
03:19:52,610 --> 03:19:53,330
It's just your venom.

3644
03:19:53,450 --> 03:19:54,330
It did go good.

3645
03:19:54,470 --> 03:19:55,970
I was three, five thousand healing.

3646
03:19:56,130 --> 03:19:56,350
Yeah.

3647
03:19:56,690 --> 03:19:57,830
It was just your venom.

3648
03:19:58,070 --> 03:20:00,410
It's just leagues above everything else.

3649
03:20:00,710 --> 03:20:00,910
Yeah.

3650
03:20:01,170 --> 03:20:01,790

first place really big shit we should actually wasn't that

3654
03:20:18,890 --> 03:20:26,370
the game we actually probably yeah was the close yeah i mean
this is we're figuring it out everyone's improving we're

3655
03:20:26,370 --> 03:20:36,510
evolving as we go yeah this is uh great we were testing out
comps too so like now we're gonna ban bucky said it that's

3656

yeah with our hell because also then i'll go hella as well
we'll have two hellos

3659
03:21:05,110 --> 03:21:06,190
It's the forbidden tech.

3660
03:21:06,330 --> 03:21:06,870
It's going to go crazy.

3661
03:21:06,910 --> 03:21:08,970
They do that in pros, in pro scrims.

3662
03:21:09,190 --> 03:21:09,210
Yep.

3663
03:21:09,490 --> 03:21:11,210
They actually go five, five Heller.

3664
03:21:11,890 --> 03:21:12,570
One support.

3665
03:21:13,070 --> 03:21:13,110
Rocket.

3666
03:21:13,110 --> 03:21:13,570
One support.

3667
03:21:13,790 --> 03:21:13,850
Yeah.

3668
03:21:14,110 --> 03:21:14,450
Rocket's on.

3669
03:21:19,500 --> 03:21:21,220
Oh, this might be a little break, isn't it?

3670
03:21:21,620 --> 03:21:22,720
We might have a little break here.

3671
03:21:23,280 --> 03:21:24,560
How long is there another team?

3672
03:21:25,100 --> 03:21:26,440
Is there another team playing right now?

3673
03:21:26,720 --> 03:21:30,340
Because they might be playing the third place and the second
place team.

3674
03:21:31,420 --> 03:21:33,700
I think it goes on simultaneously, doesn't it?

3675
03:21:34,540 --> 03:21:34,960
Oh, really?

3676
03:21:36,760 --> 03:21:37,500
But they really?

3677
03:21:37,540 --> 03:21:47,500
make us watch guys I'm guys this is gonna they said the
tournament it's gonna be a long tournament I don't want to

3678
03:21:47,500 --> 03:22:02,810
watch so it's a one-day thing but so this next round is just
like we just play one yeah but it's wait wait wait I just

3679
03:22:02,810 --> 03:22:06,610
heard something crazy could be he could be leaking on
purpose I just went to super stream because he's literally

3680
03:22:06,610 --> 03:22:10,930
the person who's hosting the attorney right so I think
that's a fair stream snipe like i'm watching i got it open

3681
03:22:10,930 --> 03:22:16,650
too right he said if strange gets banned he thinks he uh i
think he said he's strange goes van he goes wolverine and

3682
03:22:16,650 --> 03:22:22,270
goes sicko i don't know if going sicko is this could be bait
too i don't know what going sicko means i think we wolf diff

3683
03:22:22,270 --> 03:22:27,630
him if that is the case yeah and i can play invis and i
could just yeah i think it's fine if he goes true i also

3684
03:22:27,630 --> 03:22:33,630
think it's fine if he goes well it would be good my
support's got my back dude i don't mind yeah yeah trust us

3685
03:22:33,630 --> 03:22:41,410
trust us to trust you is wolf mainly is he just like gonna
focus on tanks or focus on he's gonna be on my head the

3686
03:22:41,410 --> 03:22:47,890
entire game brother he'll be on me tanks tank tank tank tank
it's miserable okay him with angela so we end up playing

3687
03:22:47,890 --> 03:22:51,850
that team again yeah i mean if we end up if we do end up
playing that team again i think we just banned support to be

3688
03:22:51,850 --> 03:22:58,790
able to force luna invis and then like uh bogers team so
they can't play that if we play like a bad map wait so i

3689
03:22:58,790 --> 03:23:04,550
don't remember what were bands were against against them
yeah yeah i

3690
03:23:08,090 --> 03:23:15,570
Yeah, because, like, they put Lydia on Sue, and I think she
was confused, because I saw her healing, and it was, like,

3691
03:23:15,570 --> 03:23:18,870
10K, 15K for Sue, and that's, like, really low.

3692
03:23:20,090 --> 03:23:21,350
So, I think that's fine.

3693
03:23:21,430 --> 03:23:22,330
There's good bands, good bands.

3694
03:23:22,470 --> 03:23:22,730
Yeah.

3695
03:23:23,450 --> 03:23:25,690
Yeah, so Rocket Fuzz, Strange Second.

3696
03:23:27,370 --> 03:23:28,830
We did get to focus her a lot.

3697
03:23:28,890 --> 03:23:33,370
Like, a lot of the time when their ults were done, she would
be, like, running backwards, and it was just free kills.

3698
03:23:33,890 --> 03:23:34,430
So, I agree.

3699
03:23:34,530 --> 03:23:35,710
I mean, keeping her off Rock, it's probably good.

3700
03:23:35,730 --> 03:23:36,690
She can't just, like, sit in the back.

3701
03:23:38,090 --> 03:23:43,550
to care really care about a low-key band because when they
had loki like it didn't really do much for it because we had

3702
03:23:43,550 --> 03:23:53,170
bucky yeah and moon night and moon night so like so the next
we could just we can do the cloak then we still do cloak so

3703
03:23:53,170 --> 03:23:56,410
it would be like rocket strange cloak again

3704
03:24:00,390 --> 03:24:03,950
gotcha then they have a wolf guaranteed but we're we're
prepared for that

3705
03:24:07,540 --> 03:24:13,020
what would be better on if if the wolf is annoying which it
sounds like we'll have it shut down anyway but would it be

3706
03:24:13,020 --> 03:24:20,440
better for me to be on namor or should i stick on the moon
knight uh i'm equally happy with like each of them i would

3707
03:24:20,440 --> 03:24:25,180
say i think moon knight's more like i could be right he's
more like raw damage and usually against a wolf that's

3708
03:24:25,180 --> 03:24:30,920
running in like if you just blow him up especially in a game
like this where like people aren't always that great like if

3709
03:24:30,920 --> 03:24:35,480
he walks too far forward and his tanks aren't covering him
at all like you could just burn his passive and then kill

3710
03:24:35,480 --> 03:24:42,020
him so the Wolverine like yeah like if he's frontlining like
the the what was it was it two units flat steam they had a

3711
03:24:42,020 --> 03:24:46,720
wolf and we like insta burned his passive because he's way
too far up and then because he missed his grab and then we

3712
03:24:46,720 --> 03:24:54,780
killed him first it is just like i'd imagine him to be i'm
just processing info i'm letting them probably but it's not

3713
03:24:54,780 --> 03:25:01,380
always the wolf sometimes like if your tank doesn't help you
uh it can totally it's entirely on your tanks and how well

3714
03:25:01,380 --> 03:25:06,300
you're supposed to look at you and stuff it's just like he
gets it like every I don't know if it's like 60 or 80 like

3715
03:25:06,300 --> 03:25:14,140
minute and a half like uh-huh um and the first time you like
kill him like you finish his health he gets like half uh

3716
03:25:14,140 --> 03:25:18,540
blue health and then he's killable and that passive is gone
for like it'll be gone for like the next fight as well so

3717
03:25:18,540 --> 03:25:25,020
burning his passive is is massive it's like the biggest
thing so if he's in a bad spot just if he's in a weird spot

3718
03:25:25,020 --> 03:25:30,760
he's your like you should shoot him every time because if we
burn his passive he has to play so safe okay easy life super

3719
03:25:30,760 --> 03:25:37,220
squishy then from that yeah I mean he's a normal DPS who's
walking like he's yeah and plus if we have if they do it

3720
03:25:37,220 --> 03:25:41,520
because we're gonna man strange if they have they have four
of our invis is gonna just i think take care of him

3721
03:25:41,520 --> 03:25:43,260
completely okay nice nice

3722
03:25:46,960 --> 03:25:57,720
this is my nerd you guys remember this is my nerds imagine
imagine it went what happened what they had the adam at one

3723
03:25:57,720 --> 03:26:04,240
point i feel like and then imagine what my team yeah he
altered and I think we won the fight after it's all, which

3724
03:26:04,240 --> 03:26:07,040
is, like, the world's got to be, like, the worst feeling on
Adam's side.

3725
03:26:09,320 --> 03:26:09,500
Hello?

3726
03:26:10,040 --> 03:26:10,100
Oh.

3727
03:26:11,080 --> 03:26:11,380
Hello.

3728
03:26:12,140 --> 03:26:13,640
You guys are going to be up first.

3729
03:26:13,780 --> 03:26:19,100
Super's doing a little breakdown with Uber and Mr. X right
now, but you guys will be the first match.

3730
03:26:19,200 --> 03:26:23,400
We're going to do this round one at a time, and we're
switching to Convoy instead of Domination.

3731
03:26:24,060 --> 03:26:26,600
So you guys are first up in probably about five minutes.

3732
03:26:27,040 --> 03:26:27,360
All right, bro.

3733
03:26:27,460 --> 03:26:27,840
Sounds good.

3734
03:26:28,020 --> 03:26:28,880
Let's get your boy home.

3735
03:26:28,980 --> 03:26:30,960
I'm just, hey, we're just going to let you know.

3736
03:26:31,060 --> 03:26:31,820
He's going home, baby.

3737
03:26:33,060 --> 03:26:41,440
he's going home but you know he's full-time casting he's
yeah this game i'm on the desk what can i say yep all right

3738
03:26:41,440 --> 03:26:49,580
thank you very much loser gets kicked off to this game and
then winner waits while the other team plays yeah yeah okay

3739
03:26:49,580 --> 03:26:57,380
okay cool and we win this that's uh so we win and then we
have a little little breaky break yeah okay but he said it's

3740
03:26:57,380 --> 03:27:03,800
a convoy what's that that's like the push the cart the cart
okay so it's a completely different play style.

3741
03:27:04,820 --> 03:27:04,960
Yes.

3742
03:27:05,640 --> 03:27:05,760
Yeah.

3743
03:27:06,120 --> 03:27:08,280
I think we'll be better at that, to be honest.

3744
03:27:09,220 --> 03:27:14,320
No, actually, we had this problem last time where we were
playing normal before and then playoffs started and we

3745
03:27:14,320 --> 03:27:16,400
fucking lost that first thing in the driveway and it wasn't.

3746
03:27:16,720 --> 03:27:19,040
No, it's because you were on Hulk, Tyler.

3747
03:27:19,240 --> 03:27:20,360
It has nothing to do.

3748
03:27:22,000 --> 03:27:25,600
Tyler, it's because you were, I remember you're Hulk, Tyler.

3749
03:27:26,060 --> 03:27:27,260
You didn't sit down at the time.

3750
03:27:27,700 --> 03:27:30,660
You didn't, you didn't have the nerve to say it then.

3751
03:27:30,740 --> 03:27:31,800
Now you're saying that a year later.

3752
03:27:31,880 --> 03:27:40,060
Yeah, yeah, you know this is the second time you know it's
not first impressions anymore she's right she's right you've

3753
03:27:40,060 --> 03:27:47,980
learned you've learned but we learned from it as long as we
keep protecting that yeah yeah yeah yeah first that's not

3754
03:27:47,980 --> 03:27:55,420
yeah and if they ban venom we still have fruit we still have
so so i could still go in on the back line on car yeah yes

3755
03:27:55,420 --> 03:27:59,400
on offense you're gonna be like it's super good still so i
mean

3756
03:28:04,320 --> 03:28:06,000
How'd you be doing the thing last game?

3757
03:28:06,260 --> 03:28:09,080
I used that strat in other tournaments now because of it.

3758
03:28:09,360 --> 03:28:10,860
What happened to Tyler?

3759
03:28:11,300 --> 03:28:11,880
I used it.

3760
03:28:12,300 --> 03:28:12,480
I learned.

3761
03:28:13,160 --> 03:28:14,380
Even at like running away, I was climbing.

3762
03:28:14,480 --> 03:28:14,860
Oh yeah.

3763
03:28:15,140 --> 03:28:15,540
That's big.

3764
03:28:15,740 --> 03:28:16,500
That'll keep you up.

3765
03:28:16,520 --> 03:28:16,940
That's the wave.

3766
03:28:17,600 --> 03:28:18,220
This guy knows tech.

3767
03:28:18,460 --> 03:28:18,980
Shots for shit.

3768
03:28:21,280 --> 03:28:22,060
Let's go.

3769
03:28:31,730 --> 03:28:32,810
We got this.

3770
03:28:33,090 --> 03:28:33,490
I believe.

3771
03:28:33,990 --> 03:28:34,530
And it would.

3772
03:28:34,630 --> 03:28:35,730
I'd never forget.

3773
03:28:36,050 --> 03:28:38,370
We never let it happen again.

3774
03:28:38,370 --> 03:28:44,590
never again

3775
03:28:47,730 --> 03:28:58,030
imagine if we're they give us midtown to that same map oh
it's Tokyo Tokyo okay that's fine

3776
03:29:02,020 --> 03:29:03,860
wonder if they get triple support again

3777
03:29:07,160 --> 03:29:12,440
definitely might i don't know Yeah, let's see if he goes DPS
because he did go.

3778
03:29:12,560 --> 03:29:14,900
He did swap to Bucky at the end, but I think he waited.

3779
03:29:15,020 --> 03:29:17,460
It was too late when he made the swap Yeah, yeah, yeah

3780
03:29:21,640 --> 03:29:28,900
I'm just glad it's not midtown Is that the map that like
transforms Tokyo?

3781
03:29:30,440 --> 03:29:39,360
Yeah, no, it's a spider in the front gate Oh, like the
little spider walking forward and then the spider-man will

3782
03:29:39,360 --> 03:29:40,520
try to pull you out.

3783
03:29:41,140 --> 03:29:42,440
Oh, that map.

3784
03:29:42,880 --> 03:29:44,120
Oh, yeah Yeah, we are.

3785
03:29:44,580 --> 03:29:44,740

Here we go, baby.

3788
03:29:49,700 --> 03:29:51,100
Now the pressure's on!

3789
03:29:51,580 --> 03:29:52,020
Yes!

3790
03:29:52,600 --> 03:29:53,040
Finally!

3791
03:29:53,480 --> 03:29:54,700
Something to play for.

3792
03:29:55,860 --> 03:29:56,640
Fuck yeah.

3793
03:29:57,520 --> 03:29:58,360
Come on!

3794
03:29:58,720 --> 03:29:59,700
It means something now.

3795
03:29:59,720 --> 03:30:00,120
Let's go.

3796
03:30:00,560 --> 03:30:00,880
Let's go.

3797
03:30:01,060 --> 03:30:01,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3798
03:30:01,440 --> 03:30:02,300
Now we try.

3799
03:30:02,560 --> 03:30:05,920
Now we pull up the actual 150%, right?

3800
03:30:06,460 --> 03:30:06,800
Yep.

3801
03:30:06,800 --> 03:30:07,160
Okay, wait.

3802
03:30:07,240 --> 03:30:09,580
So, so is payload just just one map?

3803
03:30:09,800 --> 03:30:10,100
That's it?

3804
03:30:10,220 --> 03:30:10,360
Yeah.

3805
03:30:10,380 --> 03:30:10,920
One push?

3806
03:30:13,020 --> 03:30:19,920
pushes the furthest because oh my god send these guys home
in five minutes guys let's go we could take we maybe we'll

3807
03:30:19,920 --> 03:30:27,720
hold them and then we have an easy push or they full hell
less offense or or defense we are attack we're attack yeah

3808
03:30:27,720 --> 03:30:34,040
offense so is i or they fall guitar you are leader though we
got it you gotta lock in on these bands here yeah we could

3809
03:30:34,040 --> 03:30:42,740
ask them to swap leaders can we do that it's all good it's
all good i got it yeah okay okay i believe in our bands are

3810
03:30:43,020 --> 03:30:55,000
rocket strange cloak yeah so rocket first and if they don't
ban hawkeye then we protect hawkeye yeah yeah we do give me

3811
03:30:55,000 --> 03:30:57,840
dead hawkeye well not me

3812
03:31:01,240 --> 03:31:12,760
we're just waiting for super to be ready yeah all right this
might be our last game or a second last game and then I

3813
03:31:12,760 --> 03:31:22,920
disassociate for two I miss it and I either I push God of
War to tomorrow or I disassociate for an hour and a half

3814
03:31:22,920 --> 03:31:29,160
come on bro we're just gonna get we'll see how it goes they
shivering terrified

3815
03:31:34,040 --> 03:31:39,420
oh shit no I don't want to play God of War for just two
hours That's the thing.

3816
03:31:39,680 --> 03:31:41,080
Because, like, it's a fucking long-ass game.

3817
03:31:41,240 --> 03:31:41,960
So I want to play that.

3818
03:31:42,240 --> 03:31:44,100
I want to get as much progress done as possible.

3819
03:31:44,640 --> 03:31:47,160
Because, like, every time I don't play God of War, I forget
the controls.

3820
03:31:47,300 --> 03:31:49,000
And I need this, like, ingrained in my head.

3821
03:31:49,740 --> 03:31:53,880
Because, like, I still have, like, 15 more hours of God of
War left.

3822
03:31:57,510 --> 03:31:58,070
We'll see.

3823
03:31:58,170 --> 03:31:59,110
We'll see how it goes.

3824
03:32:08,800 --> 03:32:09,160
Alright.

3825
03:32:09,160 --> 03:32:09,780
I'm still...

3826
03:32:09,780 --> 03:32:10,160
We'll see.

3827
03:32:10,200 --> 03:32:11,540
We'll see how this game goes.

3828
03:32:13,580 --> 03:32:15,400
Because right now, I'm, like, okay.

3829
03:32:17,140 --> 03:32:18,140
Well, okay is a...

3830
03:32:18,160 --> 03:32:19,580
very broad term.

3831
03:32:23,380 --> 03:32:27,280
Okay, it's a really broad term to be fair.

3832
03:32:35,460 --> 03:32:36,280
We're starting up.

3833
03:32:37,140 --> 03:32:37,400
Yeah.

3834
03:32:37,720 --> 03:32:38,480

like a double confirmation for no hawkeye ban oh and then

3847
03:33:33,450 --> 03:33:47,940
protect hawkeye protect hawkeye oh they protected strange
interesting protect hawkeye yeah and then we ban cloak and

3848
03:33:47,940 --> 03:33:57,500
dagger right yep yeah we wouldn't band strange there so
who's me our third band we need to figure that out um what

3849
03:33:57,500 --> 03:34:09,560
are support they were playing they're playing luna well
invis i actually don't know what a third band should be we

3850
03:34:09,560 --> 03:34:18,220
could just do another matt we could do bad mantis or a jeff
band oh they banned the venom so your group protect group

3851
03:34:18,220 --> 03:34:19,740
protect group yeah

3852
03:34:23,220 --> 03:34:26,220
So at least, well, they run two tanks.

3853
03:34:26,920 --> 03:34:27,240
Uh oh.

3854
03:34:27,440 --> 03:34:27,840
Yeah, they did.

3855
03:34:28,260 --> 03:34:28,620
It's okay.

3856
03:34:28,800 --> 03:34:29,520
You still have your Groot.

3857
03:34:30,240 --> 03:34:30,520
Yes.

3858
03:34:30,880 --> 03:34:31,600
I do have my group.

3859
03:34:31,980 --> 03:34:32,040
Okay.

3860
03:34:32,140 --> 03:34:34,460
So we're going to protect Groot here.

3861
03:34:38,090 --> 03:34:39,070
We're after you guys.

3862
03:34:42,430 --> 03:34:43,230
Third Ben.

3863
03:34:45,830 --> 03:34:46,350
We could.

3864
03:34:47,810 --> 03:34:50,070
I feel like they're going to force around Mantis and run the
team up.

3865
03:34:50,270 --> 03:34:51,070
Then do Mantis.

3866
03:34:51,390 --> 03:34:52,270
Maybe a bad Mantis.

3867
03:34:52,390 --> 03:34:52,550
Yeah.

3868
03:34:52,690 --> 03:34:53,030
Mantis.

3869
03:34:55,170 --> 03:35:04,230
okay I like that I think they meant your buck you were
actually we're dead I'm gonna say it they gave you Hawkeye

3870
03:35:04,230 --> 03:35:11,930
over me venom by the way bro just saying I know I know
that's our there's levels yeah or they're just scared of you

3871
03:35:11,930 --> 03:35:21,150
Tyler yeah I told you it's I'm fucking annoying back there
I'm not kidding oh that's weird I don't like that actually

3872
03:35:21,150 --> 03:35:25,330
hmm but I also don't care I can play What do we want?

3873
03:35:25,410 --> 03:35:26,710
I mean, I can play anyone pretty much anyone.

3874
03:35:26,910 --> 03:35:27,070
Can you do Strange?

3875
03:35:27,970 --> 03:35:28,750
Emma's all right too.

3876
03:35:28,750 --> 03:35:29,450
Would you rather have Strange over Emma?

3877
03:35:29,710 --> 03:35:30,990
Actually, Emma would be better, right?

3878
03:35:31,250 --> 03:35:33,250
I think I'd bully the Strange and he ults no one.

3879
03:35:33,370 --> 03:35:34,310
We're attack side first as well.

3880
03:35:34,470 --> 03:35:35,950
Yeah, I'm well then.

3881
03:35:36,330 --> 03:35:42,230
I hope this man has not played like Strange for 100 hours in
the new season already because I have not really seen much.

3882
03:35:42,370 --> 03:35:43,430
No, he definitely hasn't.

3883
03:35:43,570 --> 03:35:44,330
He definitely has not.

3884
03:35:44,790 --> 03:35:46,810
Tyler, I need you to scream when you ult, okay?

3885
03:35:48,590 --> 03:35:51,450
If he flies over my head and I can't grab him in time.

3886
03:35:51,850 --> 03:35:52,810
Because my ult is like what?

3887
03:35:53,010 --> 03:35:53,530
It's like...

3888
03:35:54,490 --> 03:36:00,670
you do it because when you all everyone gets like like
combined into the all so it sucks all right yeah yeah yeah

if you see that old go down don't even hesitate even if you

3890
03:36:08,310 --> 03:36:16,350

yeah raffle if you can't also shoot shoot the clones like

Oh, it's a trap.

3897
03:36:59,750 --> 03:37:03,210
Try to hide that, hide that big wall now, because then they
can't grab you.

3898
03:37:04,350 --> 03:37:04,570

3900
03:37:05,510 --> 03:37:09,070
Like, that big wall, if you're standing in a vicinity of it,
like they can't grab you.

3901
03:37:09,210 --> 03:37:09,990
Oh, sorry.

3902
03:37:10,210 --> 03:37:10,450

Going up top.

3912
03:37:23,710 --> 03:37:24,630
Putting that shield in front of the Hawkeye.

Emma's in a bad spot.

3923
03:37:37,110 --> 03:37:37,630
Emma's in a bad spot.

Nice.

3935
03:37:48,190 --> 03:37:49,710

03:49:56,220 --> 03:49:56,400

4295
03:49:57,100 --> 03:49:57,500

Use your all.

4297
03:49:57,980 --> 03:49:58,300

Use your all.

4300
03:49:59,500 --> 03:49:59,980
Use your all.

4301
03:50:00,380 --> 03:50:00,380
Oh.

4302
03:50:02,760 --> 03:50:03,320
It's fine.

4303
03:50:04,000 --> 03:50:04,640
I'm dying on card.

4304
03:50:04,740 --> 03:50:05,220
I killed their Hawkeye.

4305
03:50:05,560 --> 03:50:06,220
Yeah, move.

4306
03:50:06,560 --> 03:50:08,380
We just, we have our team to come back.

4307
03:50:08,660 --> 03:50:09,180
Ruffle, Ruffle, you got to touch.

4308
03:50:09,340 --> 03:50:10,140
Ruffle, you got to touch.

4309
03:50:10,540 --> 03:50:12,380
Oh, I already turned around.

4310
03:50:12,400 --> 03:50:13,760
Alt it, alt it, alt it, alt it.

4311
03:50:14,280 --> 03:50:14,340
Nice.

4312
03:50:14,480 --> 03:50:15,020
I have ammo on.

4313
03:50:15,320 --> 03:50:15,340
I'm coming out with it.

4314
03:50:15,420 --> 03:50:15,600
I'm open.

4315
03:50:16,780 --> 03:50:17,020
Nice.

4316
03:50:17,320 --> 03:50:18,700
Run him down.

4317
03:50:18,720 --> 03:50:19,220
I have ammo.

4318
03:50:19,340 --> 03:50:19,760
I'm coming back.

4319
03:50:20,020 --> 03:50:20,420
We win this.

4320
03:50:20,480 --> 03:50:20,800
We win this.

4321
03:50:21,140 --> 03:50:21,560
Look at Ironman.

4322
03:50:22,940 --> 03:50:24,020
That's a weird spot for him.

4323
03:50:24,100 --> 03:50:24,760
I did not realize he was there.

4324
03:50:24,820 --> 03:50:25,820
That was a battle for me.

4325
03:50:26,180 --> 03:50:26,820
I have Ironman on me.

4326
03:50:26,880 --> 03:50:27,440
I have Ironman on me.

4327
03:50:28,780 --> 03:50:29,060
Oh.

4328
03:50:29,760 --> 03:50:30,040
Oh.

4329
03:50:32,180 --> 03:50:34,180
Oh, oh, walk back, walk back.

4330
03:50:34,340 --> 03:50:34,580
Uh, epic.

4331
03:50:36,140 --> 03:50:37,060
Just chill, just chill.

4332
03:50:37,200 --> 03:50:37,620
Cut it out, cut out.

4333
03:50:37,700 --> 03:50:38,340
Cause we got closer spawn.

4334
03:50:38,420 --> 03:50:39,000
We got closer spawn.

4335
03:50:39,100 --> 03:50:39,740
We just got- Emma's dead.

4336
03:50:39,760 --> 03:50:40,120
There Emma's dead.

4337
03:50:40,180 --> 03:50:40,800
No bubble anymore.

4338
03:50:42,300 --> 03:50:42,700
Can't fight.

4339
03:50:42,780 --> 03:50:43,020
Can't fight.

4340
03:50:43,220 --> 03:50:43,280
No more.

4341
03:50:44,580 --> 03:50:45,420
You have to touch.

4342
03:50:45,540 --> 03:50:46,000
You have to touch.

4343
03:50:46,100 --> 03:50:46,700
You have to touch.

4344
03:50:48,760 --> 03:50:49,360
Everyone in.

4345
03:50:51,200 --> 03:50:52,160
I'm trying to touch it.

4346
03:50:52,700 --> 03:50:53,240
I was on.

4347
03:50:53,400 --> 03:50:54,560
Just water yourself out if you can.

4348
03:50:54,660 --> 03:50:55,160
Ah, I could try.

4349
03:50:55,880 --> 03:50:56,440
Alright, that was good.

4350
03:50:56,580 --> 03:50:59,460
We just held them to- We have three and a half minutes and
they have nothing.

4351
03:51:00,020 --> 03:51:00,320
Ah!

4352
03:51:00,860 --> 03:51:02,140
I kept dying, I got everything.

4353
03:51:02,160 --> 03:51:07,280
I'm sorry, that was so frustrating because I was like, oh
no, oh no, but it was so much hesitation, but I need to

4354
03:51:07,280 --> 03:51:08,220
remember he's new.

4355
03:51:08,660 --> 03:51:09,660
I need to remember he's new.

4356
03:51:10,400 --> 03:51:13,360
We have four minutes and 19 seconds to push, and they have
one minute.

4357
03:51:13,400 --> 03:51:15,540
We do that again, basically, but like, same exact thing.

4358
03:51:16,000 --> 03:51:17,320
We gotta like shake it off.

4359
03:51:17,480 --> 03:51:18,540
He is new at the game.

4360
03:51:18,600 --> 03:51:20,320
I was not sure if we were just getting smoked or what.

4361
03:51:20,460 --> 03:51:24,080
Cause I feel like we smoked them, and then I was like, I was
like, why haven't we won or anything?

4362
03:51:24,320 --> 03:51:27,220
Like, I feel like we're doing way better than they did.

4363
03:51:27,820 --> 03:51:28,560
No, we definitely are.

4364
03:51:28,560 --> 03:51:29,180
Yeah, no, we did, we did, yeah.

4365
03:51:32,240 --> 03:51:40,740
and i called it out super early before emma had him that's a
thing my old there was really bad that's why i knew i was

4366
03:51:40,740 --> 03:51:46,360
coming around the corner and their whole team was already
backed up and iron man was like he just went beyond the wall

4367
03:51:46,360 --> 03:51:52,780
and i just kind of wasted it am i fine that just standing in
the front thing like yeah i don't know what was to be doing

4368
03:51:52,780 --> 03:52:01,020
on defense by the way we were supposed to just um you have
to use the cover from the buildings here this building so

4369
03:52:01,020 --> 03:52:12,440
use the cover from this building oh i don't know your shift
wall should just go behind like like you can focus their

4370
03:52:12,440 --> 03:52:18,900
backline a lot with the with the shift walls or like cut
them off cut off the heels from their tanks and then so when

4371
03:52:18,900 --> 03:52:25,620
you're playing group you have to use these buildings come
here come back as like these buildings as like cover so you

4372
03:52:25,620 --> 03:52:26,080
literally like

4373
03:52:29,400 --> 03:52:36,180
really have any like i mean it's just emma grab nice nice
shot bro you're not smart that's what we might be able to

4374
03:52:36,180 --> 03:52:46,460
kill him quick it's not gonna get too aggressive but yeah
don't be i know i know i feel like namor plays like not

4375
03:52:46,460 --> 03:52:53,760

4377
03:52:59,600 --> 03:52:59,920
lane.

4378
03:53:00,340 --> 03:53:00,940
Neymor weakened the left.

4379
03:53:00,980 --> 03:53:02,500
Clearly you needed some help.

4380
03:53:02,900 --> 03:53:03,460
Watch out, Tyler.

4381
03:53:03,740 --> 03:53:04,120
You're low.

4382
03:53:04,620 --> 03:53:04,780
Nice.

4383
03:53:04,780 --> 03:53:05,000
Be careful.

4384
03:53:05,100 --> 03:53:06,280
I'm trying to keep an eye on their Neymor flanking.

4385
03:53:06,460 --> 03:53:07,120
He's up left somewhere.

4386
03:53:07,160 --> 03:53:08,600
Yeah, if you could do that, that'd be huge.

4387
03:53:08,680 --> 03:53:09,060
Yeah, he's on left.

4388
03:53:09,140 --> 03:53:09,900
He's down left.

4389
03:53:11,060 --> 03:53:12,200
Yeah, I'm like messing with him a lot.

4390
03:53:12,640 --> 03:53:14,980
I think you should keep your flake on me, Epic, the whole
time.

4391
03:53:15,180 --> 03:53:16,220
Yeah, 100%, 100%.

4392
03:53:16,220 --> 03:53:17,380
Don't ever give it to yourself.

4393
03:53:18,300 --> 03:53:19,320
I got you covered.

4394
03:53:21,140 --> 03:53:24,320
Stranger's low, Stranger's low, Stranger's low, Stranger's
low, Stranger's low, Stranger's low.

4395
03:53:25,660 --> 03:53:26,460
Nice, nice, nice.

4396
03:53:26,900 --> 03:53:27,320
Nice, nice.

4397
03:53:27,420 --> 03:53:28,040
Let's go.

4398
03:53:28,280 --> 03:53:29,300
Fuck off me, bitch.

4399
03:53:29,400 --> 03:53:33,800
crazy not tell you about that montana there's no way he
starts doing that right now literally no chance time to

4400
03:53:33,800 --> 03:53:41,920
switch things up including which side you're on they might
go triple tank we'll see works for me i'll just farm out

4401
03:53:41,920 --> 03:53:45,080
yeah i'm not the type who fades quietly into the background

4402
03:53:50,650 --> 03:53:59,230
better we are better we're just better let us let us walk at
the first first round so you know how to position there

4403
03:54:02,730 --> 03:54:11,610
as soon as if moxie gets a pick right right we just bone
rush it okay yeah i'll have alt pretty soon as well oh it

4404
03:54:11,610 --> 03:54:20,310

pull over i was just confident that i'd be able to farm on

4405
03:54:20,310 --> 03:54:20,810
them i guess

4406
03:54:26,050 --> 03:54:31,710
wait you thought you had all yeah you thought yeah i was
like it's all good i'm gonna 75 like Guys, our Moon

4407
03:54:31,710 --> 03:54:32,130
Knight's...

4408
03:54:32,570 --> 03:54:34,150
He's about to hold out a small...

4409
03:54:34,150 --> 03:54:35,270
I think you're going to get it quick.

4410
03:54:35,430 --> 03:54:36,590
I mean, use that...

4411
03:54:36,590 --> 03:54:38,090
Use it literally the second you get it.

4412
03:54:38,310 --> 03:54:41,050
Just throw it with an awk and try to blow something up and
call it.

4413
03:54:41,090 --> 03:54:42,190
Yeah, I mean, we should just kill them.

4414
03:54:42,310 --> 03:54:45,510
Is there Strange, the one that's 15-16 right now?

4415
03:54:45,870 --> 03:54:47,510
No, that's the Hawk Iron Man.

4416
03:54:49,350 --> 03:54:50,550
Moxie, you're a bully.

4417
03:54:52,630 --> 03:54:55,390
Listen, that works for us.

4418
03:54:55,790 --> 03:54:56,370
It's true.

4419
03:54:56,790 --> 03:54:58,710
If he's a bully, I'm a bystander right now.

4420
03:54:58,930 --> 03:55:00,070
Yeah, it's bystander.

4421
03:55:00,090 --> 03:55:00,790
We're allowing it.

4422
03:55:03,290 --> 03:55:03,930
We're allowing.

4423
03:55:04,770 --> 03:55:05,170
We're going to change.

4424
03:55:05,210 --> 03:55:05,790
Strange change in the air.

4425
03:55:05,930 --> 03:55:06,130
He's weak.

4426
03:55:07,070 --> 03:55:08,150
I can't see you for the heals.

4427
03:55:08,850 --> 03:55:09,110
It's okay.

4428
03:55:09,270 --> 03:55:10,350
I'm getting attacked by wall.

4429
03:55:10,510 --> 03:55:10,710
Sorry.

4430
03:55:10,950 --> 03:55:11,470
I don't know.

4431
03:55:12,570 --> 03:55:13,670
You can push up, Tyler.

4432
03:55:13,750 --> 03:55:14,190
You can push up.

4433
03:55:14,210 --> 03:55:14,830
Push up over Emma.

4434
03:55:15,930 --> 03:55:16,490
Like it's five.

4435
03:55:17,730 --> 03:55:18,250
Huge kill.

4436
03:55:18,370 --> 03:55:18,630
They're not support.

4437
03:55:18,750 --> 03:55:19,030
They're not support.

4438
03:55:19,170 --> 03:55:19,610
I got you.

4439
03:55:20,090 --> 03:55:20,270
I got you.

4440
03:55:20,270 --> 03:55:20,870
They sold on already.

4441
03:55:21,290 --> 03:55:22,850
I walked too hard, but we got this.

4442
03:55:23,570 --> 03:55:23,990
I grabbed a Luna.

4443
03:55:24,150 --> 03:55:24,570
I grabbed a Luna.

4444
03:55:24,930 --> 03:55:25,630
I'm right near.

4445
03:55:25,930 --> 03:55:26,830
Nice, nice, nice.

4446
03:55:27,750 --> 03:55:28,670
I'm helping Tyler.

4447
03:55:28,790 --> 03:55:29,250
I'm helping Tyler.

4448
03:55:29,470 --> 03:55:30,290
Adam, dad, Adam, one.

4449
03:55:30,490 --> 03:55:30,670
Emma one.

4450
03:55:31,250 --> 03:55:32,190
Get him over!

4451
03:55:32,490 --> 03:55:32,790
Yeah!

4452
03:55:33,310 --> 03:55:34,250
Come on!

4453
03:55:36,310 --> 03:55:38,630
Tyler, you kicked Super out of his own tournament!

4454
03:55:39,450 --> 03:55:40,290
Yes, sir!

4455
03:55:40,550 --> 03:55:42,390
He even disband me, you piece of shit.

4456
03:55:42,510 --> 03:55:43,570
Have fun watching Super?

4457
03:55:44,690 --> 03:55:47,110
Bro, you still got three hours left to cast.

4458
03:55:48,310 --> 03:55:50,070
Bro, that's gonna be rough.

4459
03:55:51,010 --> 03:55:52,110
Let's go, dude.

4460
03:55:52,490 --> 03:55:52,770
Yeah!

4461
03:55:52,770 --> 03:55:53,870
That's my team!

4462
03:55:54,210 --> 03:55:54,730
That's us!

4463
03:55:55,010 --> 03:55:55,210
MVP!

4464
03:55:56,610 --> 03:55:56,770
Yeah!

4465
03:55:57,030 --> 03:55:57,810
36, bro.

4466
03:55:57,950 --> 03:55:58,510

necros because xqc would face the uh xqc and necros are they

4477
03:57:10,390 --> 03:57:19,570
because yeah we play xqc oh okay that's good i i like that
we got to give them their first loss wait do we do no they

4478
03:57:19,570 --> 03:57:25,310
already lost ones i want to ask you it may as well be us
obviously it's gonna be us let's go i wonder how many teams

4479
03:57:25,310 --> 03:57:32,990
even gave even gave them like a a single map loss like we
might be the only team that took a map off him um what

4480
03:57:32,990 --> 03:57:40,310
what's the what's the band line that we did for him because
i i don't remember i mean we got we're gonna watch the whole

4481
03:57:40,310 --> 03:57:48,330

4486
03:58:12,830 --> 03:58:12,990

4489
03:58:29,460 --> 03:58:34,360
Guys, if you guys want to hear it, look at the...

4490
03:58:37,860 --> 03:58:47,860

gonna disassociate now did you guys just help me you guys

4491
03:58:47,860 --> 03:58:55,600
just helped me pay for my puppy with that win let's go wow
what puppy is it i got a little mini uh american shepherd

4492
03:58:55,600 --> 03:59:01,720
and he's the cutest thing ever i'm three days ago and that
was like i think i paid like 22 or 23 for everything and

4493
03:59:01,720 --> 03:59:07,640
like i mean that was that we just paid him off all right
we're winning the tournament we've got We might have puppy

4494
03:59:07,640 --> 03:59:11,540
bump he's laying in the back right now knocked out But he
knows he's paid for it.

4495
03:59:11,560 --> 03:59:11,960
So he's happy.

4496
03:59:12,140 --> 03:59:16,160
Is that like that's like the same thing almost exact dude I
yeah exact same thing.

4497
03:59:16,380 --> 03:59:21,760
They're just like they're bred to be smaller So they're like
technical name from like the kennel association or whatever

4498
03:59:21,760 --> 03:59:29,160
is like American, but it's literally like just a smaller
Mini Australian since I was like five really are you like in

4499
03:59:29,160 --> 03:59:33,120
love with they are I've heard so many things But when I was
looking for a dog everyone was saying the Aussies are so

4500
03:59:33,120 --> 03:59:33,440
great.

4501
03:59:34,140 --> 03:59:40,000
Yeah, like a lot of energy too right they do they definitely
do bro this is the first time i was like maintenance you

4502
03:59:40,000 --> 03:59:45,400
know but it's like worth it i think once he's not a puppy to
be great but he's yeah we're playing and i have in the

4503
03:59:45,400 --> 03:59:51,400
background he's like peeing on my floor and i've had to like
throw right i'm gonna like throw right games and i told i

4504
03:59:51,400 --> 03:59:57,520
told i was talking to chat about like what do i do for like
this time for this journey i was like he can i it's the only

4505
03:59:57,520 --> 04:00:01,400
time i'll probably ever have him in the crate in the
background because he cannot be running around and have me

4506
04:00:01,400 --> 04:00:08,140
looking around I'd rather I'd rather him poop in his crate
on his little bed than and throw and then throw a turny game

4507
04:00:08,140 --> 04:00:08,620
off it.

4508
04:00:08,840 --> 04:00:11,200
Yeah, a turny that's paying for him as well.

4509
04:00:11,440 --> 04:00:11,860
That's what I'm saying.

4510
04:00:12,080 --> 04:00:13,140
I can't I can't allow that.

4511
04:00:13,240 --> 04:00:16,480
He's gonna get a lot of treats if he doesn't poop in his
crate.

4512
04:00:16,600 --> 04:00:17,300
Hell yeah.

4513
04:00:18,560 --> 04:00:21,060
Now that I know that we've got puppy buff, it's over.

4514
04:00:21,740 --> 04:00:22,380
No, that's big.

4515
04:00:22,920 --> 04:00:23,300
That's big.

4516
04:00:23,520 --> 04:00:24,660
You gotta try for real.

4517
04:00:25,400 --> 04:00:26,700

4525
04:01:18,260 --> 04:01:33,900

i'm happy everyone's improving so much too ever since we

4526
04:01:33,900 --> 04:01:41,560
figured out our comp we're all improving so fast I just need
to micromanage Epic more.

4527
04:01:42,400 --> 04:01:43,380
I'll just yell at him.

4528
04:01:43,460 --> 04:01:43,660
I'll be like,

4529
04:01:47,060 --> 04:01:47,600
Yeah.

4530
04:01:48,460 --> 04:01:51,620
I just need to micromanage more.

4531
04:01:55,700 --> 04:01:56,620
Yeah, the comms are better.

4532
04:01:58,060 --> 04:02:00,460
He improved a lot because Epic doesn't play Rivals.

4533
04:02:00,520 --> 04:02:01,460
He went two more sets.

4534
04:02:01,680 --> 04:02:03,600
He has like 10 hours on Rivals.

4535
04:02:04,920 --> 04:02:05,400
And...

4536
04:02:05,400 --> 04:02:09,080
Is the XQC thing a best of one as well?

4537
04:02:09,200 --> 04:02:09,360
Yeah.

4538
04:02:09,840 --> 04:02:11,660
Only finals, which is best of three.

4539
04:02:13,420 --> 04:02:15,080
And I think it's still convoy.

4540
04:02:19,840 --> 04:02:20,220
Yeah.

tourney.

4544
04:02:57,320 --> 04:02:58,980
It's literally his own tournament.

4545

We kicked him out of it.

4546
04:03:00,360 --> 04:03:01,560

no no we play xqc all the way to finals okay that's cool

4589
04:09:19,280 --> 04:09:26,040
then because if we do play winner if we do play one of these
teams uh that deem so cool to squirrel girl will not be

4590
04:09:26,040 --> 04:09:33,820
seeing the light of day that was gross yeah most likely
we'll play he just staggered their team really bad like they

4591
04:09:33,820 --> 04:09:39,900
were all backing up to live and he like did a double jump on
her and shot a couple nuts and killed like three so i mean

04:15:55,560 --> 04:15:57,360
You guys waiting about five minutes for feelings?

Yep, we're ready.

4630
04:15:59,260 --> 04:15:59,620
All right.

4631
04:15:59,700 --> 04:16:00,320
Lock in.

4632
04:16:00,640 --> 04:16:01,080
Yes, sir.

4633
04:16:01,200 --> 04:16:01,560
Yes, sir.

4634
04:16:07,130 --> 04:16:08,070
That little looks crazy.

4635
04:16:08,170 --> 04:16:08,630
I've never seen that.

4636
04:16:26,030 --> 04:16:27,850
Do we know our bands and stuff?

4637
04:16:28,310 --> 04:16:29,410
No fucking idea.

4638
04:16:29,810 --> 04:16:30,110
Oh, no.

4639
04:16:30,270 --> 04:16:30,550
Okay.

4640
04:16:30,610 --> 04:16:31,630
I'm going to pull up X again.

4641
04:16:31,830 --> 04:16:32,270
Just look.

4642
04:16:33,910 --> 04:16:35,130
That's more just watching that game.

4643
04:16:35,370 --> 04:16:35,970
You see how Minecraft right now?

4644
04:16:36,050 --> 04:16:36,350
This is real.

4645
04:16:38,510 --> 04:16:46,250
Is he fucking speedrunning minecraft right now yeah he's
playing micro that's crazy in between the game i he doesn't

4646
04:16:46,250 --> 04:16:53,950
need this money he doesn't need this hey who is xcc yeah his
head's not in the game like us bro we like that what is

4647
04:16:53,950 --> 04:16:57,410
going on bro he's just been scrolling streams it's not in
the game true

4648
04:17:07,140 --> 04:17:16,960
dude huh yeah i mean i guess we got a band that squirrel
girl it's annoying oh okay 15.

4649
04:17:19,540 --> 04:17:21,160
So we didn't need to play Jeff last time, right?

4650
04:17:21,180 --> 04:17:25,420
Because we banned her rocket and they, I think she, I think
banning rocket is good there.

4651
04:17:26,820 --> 04:17:33,160
We should then I'm probably gonna try to guarantee play mag
and have something for the Jeff or else we're gonna be in

4652
04:17:33,160 --> 04:17:33,480
hell.

4653
04:17:36,220 --> 04:17:38,740
Because they're gonna triple support and we're not matching
it, right?

4654
04:17:39,940 --> 04:17:40,380
No.

4655
04:17:41,420 --> 04:17:41,720
Okay.

4656
04:17:42,000 --> 04:17:44,720
Then I guess we just, we just gotta have counters for their
stuff then.

4657
04:17:47,600 --> 04:17:48,360
I just go back.

4658
04:17:48,520 --> 04:17:49,820
What are we thinking they're going to be running?

4659
04:17:51,300 --> 04:17:53,380
Um, I mean, they've been...

4660
04:17:53,380 --> 04:17:59,060
Well, when Squirrel Girls banned, they make Warren go Namor,
and they go Hella with it.

4661
04:18:00,040 --> 04:18:02,300
And then if it's not banned, they go, yeah.

4662
04:18:02,540 --> 04:18:06,420
And then when it's not banned, Calvin goes Tank Deadpool.

4663
04:18:07,120 --> 04:18:07,860
I still were up.

4664
04:18:08,420 --> 04:18:09,320
Is Tank Deadpool?

4665
04:18:10,320 --> 04:18:13,040
Like, is he like, is that like a super hard thing to play?

4666
04:18:13,080 --> 04:18:16,080
I literally don't know how to play against it, so I almost
feel like I'm...

4667
04:18:16,100 --> 04:18:23,900
not that it's either i'm not but yeah i don't know i don't
think he really knows how to play it either well if he

4668
04:18:23,900 --> 04:18:30,680
played this game the last game that they won he got 14
finals on it um the game before he didn't do so well either

4669
04:18:30,680 --> 04:18:39,620
but he might have gotten against like an easy team yeah
maybe um no it was space's team and he had 14 finals and got

4670
04:18:39,620 --> 04:18:46,500
mvp and the next ice was 15 which is one on score girl so he
definitely i think he definitely knows what he's doing And I

4671
04:18:46,500 --> 04:18:47,300
don't know if you play it the whole game.

4672
04:18:47,380 --> 04:18:47,660
You might not.

4673
04:18:47,700 --> 04:18:48,360
I'm not really watching.

4674
04:18:49,380 --> 04:18:53,840
But, um, so what are we doing for Bandline?

4675
04:18:54,680 --> 04:18:55,340
I'm trying to think.

4676
04:18:57,540 --> 04:19:02,360
The Squirrel Girl, I just think, is so annoying that, like,
it's worth banning.

4677
04:19:02,540 --> 04:19:09,200
Like, if he thinks he's that good at it, and then maybe we
could, um, like, ban a Hella and Namor type of thing.

4678
04:19:09,220 --> 04:19:10,300
One of them, like Hella.

4679
04:19:10,820 --> 04:19:11,240
You want?

4680
04:19:11,280 --> 04:19:12,520
If they don't save it.

4681
04:19:12,660 --> 04:19:13,100
Oh, yeah.

4682
04:19:13,580 --> 04:19:15,620
So you don't want to focus on the supports.

4683
04:19:16,180 --> 04:19:23,040
we could too well the thing is like if we ban that rocket
she plays jeff and we lost two of them with her on jeff uh

4684
04:19:23,040 --> 04:19:32,380
but i'll be barely yeah barely true was this a team that
banned mag against us no it wasn't no i think i mean we

4685
04:19:32,380 --> 04:19:40,040
could that is the team up even it depends on what map we're
playing next is the team up good against whatever convoy map

4686
04:19:40,040 --> 04:19:56,340
we're on oh no because if we're on the ban hello how um wait
okay uh raffle waffles you here yep yep yep what's your do

4687
04:19:56,340 --> 04:20:05,320
you know how to name our old jeff uh no but we could go into
practice right now we could yeah yeah it's genuinely one of

4688
04:20:05,320 --> 04:20:09,860
the easiest things in the entire game it's like when he alts
you just throw your old like you just old and he'll eat you

4689
04:20:09,860 --> 04:20:14,560
and you kill him afterwards every time you can you can get
it a hundred percent of the time it's like a suey it

4690
04:20:14,560 --> 04:20:21,440
literally is he well it would just know well you get eaten
but like you kill him and then you're immediately on eaten

4691
04:20:21,440 --> 04:20:28,360
oh okay so it's like it is like the counter practice it join
up on the yeah here join up on the game yeah yeah and then

4692
04:20:29,080 --> 04:20:35,600
i'll get him in here and let's mess with it it's okay that
i'm looking yeah i sent i sent you an invite oh nice okay

4693
04:20:35,600 --> 04:20:41,420
yeah let's go practice range i'll go uh i'll go jeff i think
because if we ban the rocket, I think she does go Jeff

4694
04:20:41,420 --> 04:20:41,720
triple.

4695
04:20:42,060 --> 04:20:45,880
And if I don't have to counter that with Maggle, then I
could potentially counter Hello or something.

4696
04:20:46,020 --> 04:20:46,880
And that could be like huge.

4697
04:20:47,040 --> 04:20:48,040
Wait, where is the invite?

4698
04:20:48,260 --> 04:20:49,040
I can't find it.

4699
04:20:49,180 --> 04:20:50,620
Is that the, no, right side?

4700
04:20:50,680 --> 04:20:52,920
If you go on the right side, there's a practice above the
map.

4701
04:20:54,840 --> 04:20:56,200
Yeah, and then practice on the right.

4702
04:20:56,860 --> 04:20:57,020
Yep.

4703
04:20:57,680 --> 04:20:58,840
All right, I'm in there on Jeff right now.

4704
04:20:58,900 --> 04:20:59,360
I'm going to get my ult.

4705
04:21:00,960 --> 04:21:01,820
Turn on friendly.

4706
04:21:02,880 --> 04:21:03,180
Oh, yeah.

4707
04:21:04,480 --> 04:21:05,500
Friendly fire on.

4708
04:21:06,180 --> 04:21:06,880
So I'm Naimo.

4709
04:21:07,500 --> 04:21:10,120
I mean, you could also do it on Moon Knight, but...

4710
04:21:10,140 --> 04:21:11,080
You could do it on Moon Knight, too.

4711
04:21:11,260 --> 04:21:12,900
So no matter what we do, it's probably that.

4712
04:21:12,980 --> 04:21:13,560
Here, come down left.

4713
04:21:13,920 --> 04:21:15,880
Yeah, you just Moon Knight, the E.

4714
04:21:17,520 --> 04:21:17,900
I'm shooting.

4715
04:21:18,000 --> 04:21:18,800
Come left, come left, come left.

4716
04:21:19,160 --> 04:21:19,980
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

4717
04:21:19,980 --> 04:21:21,100
Oh, no, no, he's looking at me.

4718
04:21:21,200 --> 04:21:21,340
It's fine.

4719
04:21:21,440 --> 04:21:21,820
You're looking at the wrong guy.

4720
04:21:22,380 --> 04:21:23,580
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, wrong, Jeff.

4721
04:21:24,000 --> 04:21:26,580
This is just more open spot and less hectic, so I was going
to be like, yeah, I came in here.

4722
04:21:26,860 --> 04:21:28,300
But grab your ult and then on the thing.

4723
04:21:28,320 --> 04:21:28,780
Yeah, I have ult.

4724
04:21:29,260 --> 04:21:33,400
Okay, now I'm literally just going to ult, and when I pop
it, I'm going to try to eat you.

4725
04:21:33,520 --> 04:21:35,540
I'm not surprised that I see one against Flask.

4726
04:21:35,640 --> 04:21:37,840
I think Flask just had too many support players.

4727
04:21:40,140 --> 04:21:40,420
Sorry.

4728
04:21:40,980 --> 04:21:43,500
In three, four support players or something.

4729
04:21:43,740 --> 04:21:44,180
You're old again.

4730
04:21:44,440 --> 04:21:45,500
You throw in the middle of where I'm eating.

4731
04:21:45,680 --> 04:21:45,940
No, no, no.

4732
04:21:46,040 --> 04:21:47,540
So like, you'll see, it's a quick thing.

4733
04:21:47,600 --> 04:21:48,780
You should just hold your ult out.

4734
04:21:49,200 --> 04:21:50,560
Like, literally hold your ult out right now.

4735
04:21:50,960 --> 04:21:52,320
I'm gonna eat you and you just throw it.

4736
04:21:52,560 --> 04:21:53,600
No, don't throw it.

4737
04:21:53,840 --> 04:21:54,460
Wait, am I wrong?

4738
04:21:54,520 --> 04:21:55,380
Is that how Namura works?

4739
04:21:55,460 --> 04:21:56,520
No, it is how Namura works.

4740
04:21:56,920 --> 04:21:57,920
No, no, no.

4741
04:21:57,960 --> 04:21:59,920
Okay, okay, okay.

4742
04:22:00,100 --> 04:22:00,640
Wait, I get that.

4743
04:22:00,780 --> 04:22:01,400
Well, I'll explain.

4744
04:22:01,600 --> 04:22:05,000
So this pool that I'm dropping is now where Jeff's coming
up.

4745
04:22:05,480 --> 04:22:06,400
This is where Jeff.

4746
04:22:06,700 --> 04:22:07,680
Yeah, this is a heel pool.

4747
04:22:08,000 --> 04:22:11,020
This pool that I'm gonna be on your right, is where Jeff's
going to eat.

4748
04:22:11,140 --> 04:22:12,440
So you throw in the middle of it.

4749
04:22:12,860 --> 04:22:13,420
I'll do it now.

4750
04:22:13,540 --> 04:22:13,800
Too late.

4751
04:22:13,900 --> 04:22:15,360
Oh, so I need to not be in the pool.

4752
04:22:15,500 --> 04:22:16,120
No, you can't be.

4753
04:22:16,120 --> 04:22:16,900
No, no, it doesn't matter.

4754
04:22:17,080 --> 04:22:17,940
Here, ready for this?

4755
04:22:18,220 --> 04:22:19,360
I imagine I'm eating you.

4756
04:22:19,520 --> 04:22:20,040
You have your old, right?

4757
04:22:20,440 --> 04:22:21,740
Or imagine Moxie's eating you as Jeff.

4758
04:22:21,940 --> 04:22:22,600
Are you close to him?

4759
04:22:22,600 --> 04:22:22,840
I'm going to go.

4760
04:22:23,320 --> 04:22:23,460
I'm going.

4761
04:22:24,820 --> 04:22:24,920
I'm going.

4762
04:22:24,920 --> 04:22:25,060
Yep.

4763
04:22:25,360 --> 04:22:26,540
He's dead every time.

4764
04:22:26,680 --> 04:22:30,980
You could, now it's a little tougher because if the Jeff
doesn't eat you, you have to just aim it.

4765
04:22:31,080 --> 04:22:32,260
But again, get your old.

4766
04:22:32,320 --> 04:22:32,680
You have it?

4767
04:22:33,240 --> 04:22:41,200
Well, if the Jeff is going to eat, i'm gonna stand next to
our name more then i'm dead every time there's nothing i can

4768
04:22:41,200 --> 04:22:46,240
do about that if you hit that we will win the game probably
for free because that jeff was getting some ults on us last

4769
04:22:46,240 --> 04:22:51,980
time i want to say that we couldn't counter um because we
did yeah we just you just you're literally all you're doing

4770
04:22:51,980 --> 04:22:58,700
is waiting for that second that second pool no matter where
it is yeah and we all should honestly stand on purpose so he

4771
04:22:58,700 --> 04:23:04,020
can just ult himself so it's easier when they're jeff ults
but yeah i mean super simple you seem you got it even when i

4772
04:23:04,020 --> 04:23:04,700
didn't hold on you.

4773
04:23:04,840 --> 04:23:06,840
So I think we're, I think we're fine.

4774
04:23:07,980 --> 04:23:08,860
You could pull one of these off.

4775
04:23:13,320 --> 04:23:13,320
Okay.

4776
04:23:13,920 --> 04:23:14,660
Yeah, you got it.

4777
04:23:14,760 --> 04:23:17,780
I mean, it's, but yeah, if you do that, or even with Moon
Knight.

4778
04:23:17,920 --> 04:23:22,060
I mean, you just Moon Knight through the Ankh or just Moon
Knight ult the Jeff, like, can you, can you help me one more

4779
04:23:22,060 --> 04:23:22,260
time?

4780
04:23:22,320 --> 04:23:23,900
I just want to see what the timing is like for,

4781
04:23:28,510 --> 04:23:31,170
okay, so I hear a ding, ding, ding, and then it eats.

4782
04:23:31,250 --> 04:23:34,730
Yeah, there's a little, the bell is, the bell is honestly,
like a good indicator.

4783
04:23:35,070 --> 04:23:37,210
Wait, but is the bell your skin, your Jeff's skin?

4784
04:23:38,090 --> 04:23:39,050
No, I think it's just Jeff.

4785
04:23:39,330 --> 04:23:39,750
Oh, okay.

4786
04:23:41,510 --> 04:23:47,630
because i don't know if you're using a special skin for it
because each jeff has a each jeff skin has a special thing

4787
04:23:47,630 --> 04:23:56,630
also they're saying we're red if we're ready what were we
first banning we're first banning squirrel girl yeah nice

4789
04:24:06,430 --> 04:24:10,830

they probably they might save rocket but if they do they

4790
04:24:10,830 --> 04:24:19,170

the mad god on the cloak all i

4792
04:24:37,040 --> 04:24:46,880

4797
04:25:17,740 --> 04:25:20,340

4798
04:25:22,880 --> 04:25:23,040
Oh?

4799
04:25:23,440 --> 04:25:24,860
Oh, there was a fuck something up.

4800
04:25:25,020 --> 04:25:25,480
That, give me.

4801
04:25:26,020 --> 04:25:27,560
Oh, now they know what we've banned first.

4802
04:25:30,040 --> 04:25:30,560
Scrims.

4803
04:25:32,000 --> 04:25:32,840
What happened?

4804
04:25:33,220 --> 04:25:33,860
Oh, no.

4805
04:25:34,960 --> 04:25:36,360
Oh, it's the wrong map.

4806
04:25:36,560 --> 04:25:38,260
They were playing Tokyo again.

4807
04:25:38,440 --> 04:25:38,920
Unless...

4808
04:25:38,920 --> 04:25:39,620
Oh, yeah.

4809
04:25:41,300 --> 04:25:43,100
Tyler is midtown.

4810
04:25:44,900 --> 04:25:47,340
That's the map that you played Hulk on.

4811
04:25:48,100 --> 04:25:49,500
Okay, no door opening.

4812
04:25:49,920 --> 04:25:50,700
Keep it shut.

4813
04:25:52,680 --> 04:25:52,920
Huh?

4814
04:25:54,060 --> 04:25:54,660
Don't worry about it.

4815
04:25:54,780 --> 04:25:55,000
It's alright.

4816
04:25:55,140 --> 04:25:55,980
It's just my PTSD.

4817
04:25:56,440 --> 04:25:56,880
Do you have a kid?

4818
04:25:57,000 --> 04:25:57,340
A ruffle?

4819
04:25:57,820 --> 04:25:58,140
Oh!

4820
04:25:58,760 --> 04:26:00,360
That's not that you played a Hulk on it.

4821
04:26:00,440 --> 04:26:01,080
That's what you said.

4822
04:26:01,360 --> 04:26:01,460
Okay.

4823
04:26:02,300 --> 04:26:03,600
I didn't hear...

4824
04:26:03,600 --> 04:26:04,520
I didn't hear what you said.

4825
04:26:04,660 --> 04:26:05,020
I got you.

4826
04:26:06,260 --> 04:26:07,440
It's your redemption arc.

4827
04:26:07,580 --> 04:26:08,080
This is...

4828
04:26:08,080 --> 04:26:09,460
What bad game we just lost.

4829
04:26:09,660 --> 04:26:09,960
No, no.

4830
04:26:10,060 --> 04:26:12,020
This is literally your redemption arc, Tyler.

4831
04:26:12,660 --> 04:26:13,600
This is like, we fight...

4832
04:26:13,600 --> 04:26:16,600
We fought XQC on this exact same map as well.

4833
04:26:17,740 --> 04:26:18,720
Oh shit, it is!

4834
04:26:18,760 --> 04:26:19,000
Yeah!

4835
04:26:19,260 --> 04:26:19,620
Let's go!

4836
04:26:19,980 --> 04:26:20,760
Squirrel, we've got him.

4837
04:26:20,920 --> 04:26:21,000
Squirrel.

4838
04:26:21,560 --> 04:26:21,620
Yes.

4839
04:26:21,780 --> 04:26:22,000
Yeah.

4840
04:26:23,260 --> 04:26:25,620
We just banned our...

4841
04:26:25,620 --> 04:26:26,600
Our captain just banned himself.

4842
04:26:27,260 --> 04:26:28,060
Oh, hell yeah.

4843
04:26:28,420 --> 04:26:28,700
Yeah.

4844
04:26:29,400 --> 04:26:29,820
Aura.

4845
04:26:30,460 --> 04:26:30,820
Oh.

4846
04:26:31,300 --> 04:26:32,260
And then protect Venom.

4847
04:26:39,690 --> 04:26:39,970
What?

4848
04:26:41,290 --> 04:26:41,590
Who left?

4849
04:26:41,590 --> 04:26:41,910
Is that bad?

4850
04:26:41,990 --> 04:26:42,310
That's weird.

4851
04:26:42,730 --> 04:26:43,450
We play that?

4852
04:26:45,930 --> 04:26:47,670
Why is my whole chat spamming GG?

4853
04:26:48,950 --> 04:26:49,590
Is it Hawkeye's name?

4854
04:26:49,590 --> 04:26:49,870
Is that why?

4855
04:26:51,510 --> 04:26:52,250
It's okay.

4856
04:26:53,290 --> 04:26:54,090
Ignore them.

4857
04:26:54,130 --> 04:26:55,310
Oh, we're gonna.

4858
04:26:55,310 --> 04:26:55,650
Oh, we're gonna.

4859
04:26:55,650 --> 04:26:57,390
So they're doing the Nemoa Hella combo.

4860
04:26:57,850 --> 04:26:59,670
Then we have to ban Hella then, didn't we?

4861
04:27:00,550 --> 04:27:01,090
We can.

4862
04:27:01,730 --> 04:27:03,050
Yeah, I think that's a good call.

4863
04:27:03,330 --> 04:27:05,950
Yeah, ban Hella so they don't get team up.

4864
04:27:06,610 --> 04:27:07,130
Yeah, screw it.

4865
04:27:07,210 --> 04:27:08,190
This is a good Hella map.

4866
04:27:08,490 --> 04:27:11,390
I feel like we should ban like Rocket.

4867
04:27:11,930 --> 04:27:12,770
But this is a good Hella.

4868
04:27:13,050 --> 04:27:14,170
This is a good Hella map.

4869
04:27:14,270 --> 04:27:14,970
Remember Midtown?

4870
04:27:15,510 --> 04:27:18,870
Yeah, but I think like it's a lot more effective Rocket.

4871
04:27:19,290 --> 04:27:20,910
I mean, I don't think they're gonna save Hella second.

4872
04:27:21,310 --> 04:27:22,130
Okay, Rocket then.

4873
04:27:22,950 --> 04:27:23,710
Yeah, ban rocket.

4874
04:27:24,790 --> 04:27:29,590
I swear to God, if he saves Taya, this is on you, this is on
you, Moxie.

4875
04:27:29,750 --> 04:27:30,750
They might save Groot, too.

4876
04:27:31,290 --> 04:27:32,190
That's on you.

4877
04:27:34,110 --> 04:27:35,390
Oh, they're going to play Groot.

4878
04:27:36,210 --> 04:27:37,230
What's our last ban then?

4879
04:27:37,770 --> 04:27:38,010
Hello.

4880
04:27:38,290 --> 04:27:39,470
They bet it's either Hello or Rocket.

4881
04:27:39,690 --> 04:27:41,250
I swear to God, Moxie.

4882
04:27:41,890 --> 04:27:43,150
Yeah, it's going to be hell.

4883
04:27:43,170 --> 04:27:44,310
Well, we don't ban Groot.

4884
04:27:44,590 --> 04:27:44,830
They might.

4885
04:27:45,950 --> 04:27:47,370
Like, they're going to protect it.

4886
04:27:47,490 --> 04:27:48,510
I swear to God.

4887
04:27:49,090 --> 04:27:50,030
I think they've been protected.

4888
04:27:52,490 --> 04:27:52,930
Oh, yeah.

4889
04:27:52,950 --> 04:28:00,850
thinking about it oh okay they they can't run hello anymore
yeah okay we protect protect something else we protect what

4890
04:28:00,850 --> 04:28:10,330
do we protect bucky bucky you said you're not gonna run it
well he either plays hella or plays deadpool oh the

4891
04:28:10,330 --> 04:28:18,290
deadpoint memoir is not a good team up though it could be i
think i think like the thing is is that band group too yeah

4892
04:28:18,290 --> 04:28:26,370
because they're gonna go mantis they're gonna yeah that's
true band group yeah do it i like that okay all right we'll

4893
04:28:26,370 --> 04:28:33,750
just have to deal with hella and the more then we're gonna
be venom and i'll go emma or mag would you guys rather have

4894
04:28:33,750 --> 04:28:40,550
i can bully this strange more and he's definitely gonna play
strange on emma but either one is fine you want me on the

4895
04:28:40,550 --> 04:28:48,470
moon night on the wall i think the more because if she's
playing jeff roots band too yeah and they've had his You're

4896
04:28:48,470 --> 04:28:49,150
playing Namur, I think.

4897
04:28:49,270 --> 04:28:49,730
Oh, yeah.

4898
04:28:50,030 --> 04:28:50,050
Personally.

4899
04:28:50,390 --> 04:28:51,010
Oh, Moonite's banned.

4900
04:28:51,210 --> 04:28:51,310
Okay.

4901
04:28:52,770 --> 04:28:53,310
All right.

4902
04:28:53,470 --> 04:28:54,430
They did their research on you, bro.

4903
04:28:54,490 --> 04:28:55,150
You just got targeted.

4904
04:28:55,370 --> 04:28:56,290
Listen, I'll take it.

4905
04:28:56,330 --> 04:28:56,730
I'll take it.

4906
04:28:56,770 --> 04:28:57,170
I'll take it.

4907
04:28:57,170 --> 04:28:58,090
I'll take it.

4908
04:28:58,930 --> 04:29:01,230
But if they play Gambit, then I'll play Gambit.

4909
04:29:01,810 --> 04:29:02,130
But I agree.

4910
04:29:02,150 --> 04:29:03,470
We're going to the finals, baby.

4911
04:29:03,670 --> 04:29:04,150
Let's go.

4912
04:29:04,550 --> 04:29:05,090
Come on.

4913
04:29:05,470 --> 04:29:08,930
One goddamn payload game in your pathetic lives.

4914
04:29:09,010 --> 04:29:10,210
Just fucking win it.

4915
04:29:11,250 --> 04:29:12,110
You pieces of shit.

4916
04:29:12,230 --> 04:29:14,050
Or attack so I can swap fast.

4917
04:29:14,510 --> 04:29:14,850
I like that.

4918
04:29:14,950 --> 04:29:15,230
You're pieces of shit.

4919
04:29:15,430 --> 04:29:16,630
But we're your pieces of shit.

4920
04:29:17,050 --> 04:29:17,390
Yeah.

4921
04:29:18,050 --> 04:29:19,250
Yes, sir.

4922
04:29:22,070 --> 04:29:23,370
We start on attack or defense?

4923
04:29:23,430 --> 04:29:24,170
You said they can attack.

4924
04:29:24,730 --> 04:29:24,770
Back.

4925
04:29:27,470 --> 04:29:30,510
So, yeah, so if they do run Gambit, I'll swap the Gambit.

4926
04:29:30,790 --> 04:29:32,290
Wait, who should I put the Snowflake on?

4927
04:29:33,050 --> 04:29:33,450
Moxie.

4928
04:29:33,590 --> 04:29:35,210
Put Snowflake on me.

4929
04:29:36,190 --> 04:29:39,630
And then you can't press F because it takes it away and puts
it on you.

4930
04:29:39,730 --> 04:29:40,830
Yeah, I'm Daredevil on this.

4931
04:29:41,490 --> 04:29:41,950
The red guy.

4932
04:29:42,210 --> 04:29:43,010
Sorry, if you guys said anything I missed.

4933
04:29:43,090 --> 04:29:44,870
Do you guys want mag or do you guys want?

4934
04:29:45,050 --> 04:29:45,590
I would rather.

4935
04:29:45,590 --> 04:29:46,430
Are we actually Daredevil?

4936
04:29:47,270 --> 04:29:48,110
I think so.

4937
04:29:48,210 --> 04:29:49,010
We do mag then.

4938
04:29:49,330 --> 04:29:49,510
Run mag.

4939
04:29:49,890 --> 04:29:51,210
I mean, like, unless I see what...

4940
04:29:52,090 --> 04:29:53,370
We'll do mag 100%.

4941
04:29:53,370 --> 04:29:55,790
If things aren't working, speak up, guys.

4942
04:29:56,050 --> 04:29:56,630
By the way.

4943
04:29:56,750 --> 04:29:56,810
Yeah.

4944
04:29:56,990 --> 04:29:57,130
Yeah.

4945
04:29:57,130 --> 04:30:00,210
We're constantly figuring it out as the game.

4946
04:30:00,250 --> 04:30:01,890
I'll say something if I think it's not working.

4947
04:30:04,010 --> 04:30:04,870
They have hella.

4948
04:30:04,950 --> 04:30:05,910
They have hella on the top right.

4949
04:30:06,030 --> 04:30:06,750
Yeah, they're going to hella more.

4950
04:30:08,090 --> 04:30:10,430
Yeah, I'm going to go switch.

4951
04:30:10,950 --> 04:30:11,310
Maybe.

4952
04:30:14,160 --> 04:30:15,120
Yeah, hella on him on top.

4953
04:30:15,460 --> 04:30:15,800
Those of them.

4954
04:30:15,980 --> 04:30:16,600
So we need a one.

4955
04:30:16,960 --> 04:30:17,540
Jeff had to drop.

4956
04:30:17,700 --> 04:30:18,440
Hey, heals are bad up top.

4957
04:30:20,340 --> 04:30:21,100
No bird.

4958
04:30:21,640 --> 04:30:22,160
Careful, careful, Raffle.

4959
04:30:22,740 --> 04:30:23,480
Oh, sorry.

4960
04:30:24,900 --> 04:30:25,480
Yeah, just play main.

4961
04:30:25,800 --> 04:30:27,620
All you gotta do is just play with our team main.

4962
04:30:27,840 --> 04:30:28,700
I'll be on the flanks.

4963
04:30:29,120 --> 04:30:30,580
Okay, okay, sounds good.

4964
04:30:31,880 --> 04:30:32,340
Can I hear you?

4965
04:30:33,740 --> 04:30:34,620
Yeah, I'm back in the straight.

4966
04:30:34,640 --> 04:30:37,060
You don't take your flake off of me.

4967
04:30:37,060 --> 04:30:37,300
Yeah.

4968
04:30:37,820 --> 04:30:38,200
Jesus.

4969
04:30:43,040 --> 04:30:43,620
They're hard.

4970
04:30:44,360 --> 04:30:45,080
Look at strange, look at strange.

4971
04:30:45,180 --> 04:30:45,580
I'm gonna cut his heels.

4972
04:30:46,300 --> 04:30:47,280
I couldn't pull them.

4973
04:30:47,580 --> 04:30:47,780
Nice.

4974
04:30:49,120 --> 04:30:49,440
Nice.

4975
04:30:51,420 --> 04:30:53,080
Strange, strange, strange, strange, strange.

4976
04:30:53,080 --> 04:30:53,420
Strange, strange, strange.

4977
04:30:54,540 --> 04:30:55,060
Strange, strange.

4978
04:30:55,240 --> 04:30:56,120
I pulled him back.

4979
04:30:56,240 --> 04:30:56,660
I pulled him back.

4980
04:30:56,780 --> 04:30:56,980
I pulled him back.

4981
04:30:56,980 --> 04:30:57,020
He's low.

4982
04:30:57,180 --> 04:30:57,340
He's low.

4983
04:30:58,480 --> 04:30:58,540
Nice, nice.

4984
04:31:00,380 --> 04:31:00,620
Nice.

4985
04:31:00,620 --> 04:31:01,080
No, no, no, no.

4986
04:31:01,920 --> 04:31:04,500
Strange, strange, strange, strange.

4987
04:31:04,680 --> 04:31:04,720
Strange, strange.

4988
04:31:04,720 --> 04:31:05,600
He's pushing.

4989
04:31:05,640 --> 04:31:06,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4990
04:31:06,920 --> 04:31:07,220
Nice.

4991
04:31:09,900 --> 04:31:10,840
I have Alt here.

4992
04:31:11,180 --> 04:31:12,140
I'm going to let you build Alt now.

4993
04:31:12,240 --> 04:31:12,880
I'm going to let you build Alt.

4994
04:31:13,120 --> 04:31:13,820
He'll heal, Tyler.

4995
04:31:14,700 --> 04:31:14,840
Yeah.

4996
04:31:14,840 --> 04:31:15,760
What do I have Alt for?

4997
04:31:16,280 --> 04:31:17,180
Uh, should I hold for Helm?

4998
04:31:17,180 --> 04:31:17,740
I can hold for Helm.

4999
04:31:17,780 --> 04:31:18,720
Or I hold for Jeff, right?

5000
04:31:19,040 --> 04:31:19,360
No.

5001
04:31:19,460 --> 04:31:20,700
If we have Neymor, that happens.

5002
04:31:21,720 --> 04:31:22,720
Well, I'm gonna pull one.

5003
04:31:22,760 --> 04:31:23,380
He might have it early.

5004
04:31:23,500 --> 04:31:24,160
I'm looking for the support.

5005
04:31:24,400 --> 04:31:26,120
I'm looking for a bucky.

5006
04:31:26,140 --> 04:31:26,900
I'm looking for a bucky.

5007
04:31:26,900 --> 04:31:27,860

Okay, three, two, one, bucky.

Oh my God, kill that, kill that, kill that.

04:31:35,340 --> 04:31:38,540
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.

5013
04:31:38,740 --> 04:31:39,040
Oh, nice.

5014
04:31:39,140 --> 04:31:39,740
We have, we have, we have, we have.

5015
04:31:40,440 --> 04:31:41,640
No more, no more, no more.

5016
04:31:41,780 --> 04:31:42,780
No more, no more, no more.

5017
04:31:43,080 --> 04:31:43,360
No more, no more, no more, no more.

5018
04:31:43,420 --> 04:31:43,680
No more, it's fine.

5019
04:31:43,840 --> 04:31:44,020
We're fine.

5020
04:31:45,620 --> 04:31:47,380
Strange, strange, strange, strange, strange, strange,
strange.

5021
04:31:48,140 --> 04:31:50,120
All right, it's that beautiful, beautiful, guys.

5022
04:31:50,520 --> 04:31:51,660
Who is this?

5023
04:31:52,480 --> 04:31:52,900
Alright, nice.

5024
04:31:54,120 --> 04:31:54,820
I have ult.

5025
04:31:55,060 --> 04:31:56,100
Alright, let me heal more.

5026
04:31:56,300 --> 04:31:57,040
Did Jeff, I'll just let him know?

5027
04:31:57,500 --> 04:31:58,920
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

5028
04:31:59,000 --> 04:31:59,700
Save it, save it, save it.

5029
04:31:59,940 --> 04:32:00,560
That's you, bro.

5030
04:32:00,900 --> 04:32:01,600
That's all you, I believe.

5031
04:32:02,400 --> 04:32:03,480
You're pushing your, you're talking.

5032
04:32:03,680 --> 04:32:04,220
You're talking.

5033
04:32:04,980 --> 04:32:05,860
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5034
04:32:06,060 --> 04:32:06,420
I'm bad habit.

5035
04:32:06,560 --> 04:32:07,500
Are you, you're probably going to hold for...

5036
04:32:07,500 --> 04:32:08,100
Walk up, maybe?

5037
04:32:08,740 --> 04:32:09,620
Yeah, I'm walking up with you.

5038
04:32:09,880 --> 04:32:10,700
Yeah, I have my ult.

5039
04:32:10,800 --> 04:32:11,380
Just let me know.

5040
04:32:11,540 --> 04:32:11,820
Yeah.

5041
04:32:12,160 --> 04:32:15,180
I think you hold for maybe strange, like pop it off strange
ult, maybe?

5042
04:32:15,480 --> 04:32:16,320
Or to counter an ult.

5043
04:32:16,760 --> 04:32:17,520
We can comment as we go.

5044
04:32:17,940 --> 04:32:18,080
Yeah.

5045
04:32:18,080 --> 04:32:18,920
Wait, guys, do we need...

5046
04:32:18,920 --> 04:32:19,920
Yeah, I got someone for us.

04:32:21,720 --> 04:32:22,700
Let me heal mostly.

5048
04:32:22,720 --> 04:32:23,200
I'm holding for cloak.

5049
04:32:23,300 --> 04:32:23,760
I'm holding for cloak.

5050
04:32:24,560 --> 04:32:25,640
Watch out, they're going to have it.

04:32:30,680 --> 04:32:31,200
Okay, it's okay.

5055
04:32:31,300 --> 04:32:33,000
I might hold for Jeff or cloak then, whoever comes first.

5056
04:32:33,280 --> 04:32:33,980
I'm trying to heal you, Tyler.

5057

They're resetting.

5118
04:34:36,200 --> 04:34:37,780

04:35:25,560 --> 04:35:26,360
Run back, run back, run back.

Try and do.

5156
04:35:27,140 --> 04:35:27,680

Hella's top left.

5225
04:37:21,880 --> 04:37:23,580
So shoot out that Hella closet if she can.

5226
04:37:23,640 --> 04:37:25,360
I will if she peeks me.

5227
04:37:26,400 --> 04:37:27,680
Not peeking, I think she's staying on the right.

5228
04:37:27,900 --> 04:37:28,860
Oh my god, I'm hit.

5229
04:37:29,380 --> 04:37:30,640
God, I'm dead.

5230
04:37:32,000 --> 04:37:33,280
We're 30 seconds, it's fine, it's fine.

5231
04:37:33,520 --> 04:37:34,200
You still have another fight.

5232
04:37:34,660 --> 04:37:35,320
You can just back up.

5233
04:37:35,400 --> 04:37:36,180
I don't want to build them.

5234
04:37:36,620 --> 04:37:37,820
Just play around corners, play around corners.

5235
04:37:38,280 --> 04:37:39,380
You might hard push this though.

5236
04:37:39,980 --> 04:37:40,900
Yeah, they're hard pushing this.

5237
04:37:41,480 --> 04:37:42,180
Try and save them.

5238
04:37:42,200 --> 04:37:42,580
That's fine.

5239
04:37:42,720 --> 04:37:43,300

04:38:05,780 --> 04:38:06,880
Focus on strange.

You need to lock in.

04:52:30,960 --> 04:52:32,540
It's nice, it's just Hella.

5530
04:52:34,100 --> 04:52:35,040
Up, agree.

5531
04:52:35,240 --> 04:52:36,020
I did save.

5532
04:52:37,300 --> 04:52:38,220
I did save.

5533
04:52:38,240 --> 04:52:39,800
She did save, we had Hella!

5534
04:52:40,200 --> 04:52:40,880
High time.

5535
04:52:41,680 --> 04:52:42,600
She was right.

5536
04:52:43,160 --> 04:52:44,600
They had a bed full summer.

5537
04:52:45,100 --> 04:52:46,040
It was too...

5538
04:52:46,040 --> 04:52:48,260
He completely killed the entire game, bro.

5539
04:52:48,400 --> 04:52:49,680
That's actually not...

5540
04:52:49,680 --> 04:52:51,640
I don't know what that champ does, but...

5541
04:52:51,640 --> 04:52:52,260
No, that's...

5542
04:52:52,260 --> 04:52:53,460
Hela is strong on this map.

5543
04:52:53,540 --> 04:52:54,680
That's why I wanted the Hela Band.

5544
04:52:55,420 --> 04:52:56,100
Not a speaker.

5545
04:52:56,280 --> 04:52:56,520
You beat me.

5546
04:52:56,580 --> 04:52:57,300
He was confident.

5547
04:52:57,340 --> 04:52:57,580
Whoa!

5548
04:52:57,700 --> 04:52:58,880
I was so confident.

5549
04:52:59,140 --> 04:53:00,340
I was so confident.

5550
04:53:00,480 --> 04:53:01,360
We watched the VOD.

5551
04:53:01,580 --> 04:53:03,760
I was like, Hela Band, Hela Band, Hela Band.

5552
04:53:04,200 --> 04:53:05,140
And they're like, no.

5553
04:53:06,680 --> 04:53:07,020
Guys.

5554
04:53:07,740 --> 04:53:08,120
Guys.

5555
04:53:08,760 --> 04:53:10,040
All right, they had a Mantis play.

5556
04:53:10,060 --> 04:53:10,540
It makes sense.

5557
04:53:10,640 --> 04:53:11,600
They had a Mantis player.

5558
04:53:11,680 --> 04:53:17,560
who they're going to run the group team up with all right
they just had a 2v1 every time on the side that's just how

5559
04:53:17,560 --> 04:53:23,980
it goes yeah it's brutal if anyone else oh how's the save
anna i was gonna like tank i could have gone mantis and pop

5560
04:53:23,980 --> 04:53:33,540
like pocketed you but i think we had to have you on tank
though it was just we just had yeah yeah yeah yeah who it is

5561
04:53:33,540 --> 04:53:39,680
guys okay it's not ggs it's just It's not our map.

5562
04:53:39,940 --> 04:53:40,620
It's not.

5563
04:53:40,880 --> 04:53:42,800
Oh, this stupid fucking map is shit.

5564
04:53:42,980 --> 04:53:44,860
Yeah, this is a cursed map for us.

5565
04:53:45,320 --> 04:53:45,640
Ah, damn.

5566
04:53:45,700 --> 04:53:47,000
Is there not any more maps to push payload?

5567
04:53:47,120 --> 04:53:47,880
There is.

5568
04:53:48,320 --> 04:53:50,820
But they purposely picked this one for us.

5569
04:53:54,000 --> 04:53:54,540
GG's though.

5570
04:53:54,640 --> 04:53:55,660
At least we're not last.

5571
04:53:56,300 --> 04:54:00,260
At least we paid for Claus's puppy, bro.

5572
04:54:00,480 --> 04:54:00,980
At least the puppy.

5573
04:54:02,000 --> 04:54:02,800
Not last.

5574
04:54:03,640 --> 04:54:06,680
4% or 4k, right?

5575
04:54:06,820 --> 04:54:07,460
Perpartisan, I think.

5576
04:54:08,380 --> 04:54:08,780
3k.

5577
04:54:08,820 --> 04:54:09,220
300.

5578
04:54:10,340 --> 04:54:12,100
3,300, oh my God.

5579
04:54:12,420 --> 04:54:13,540
33, 33 or something like that.

5580
04:54:16,440 --> 04:54:17,320
All right guys, GG.

5581
04:54:18,120 --> 04:54:18,320
GG's.

5582
04:54:18,720 --> 04:54:19,160
GG's.

5583
04:54:19,160 --> 04:54:20,300
Nice fight you guys, get to see you next year.

5584
04:54:20,540 --> 04:54:22,320
Fucking start practicing maybe a little bit guys.

5585
04:54:23,800 --> 04:54:27,140
Oh, well, Tyler, when I moved that portal by the way.

5586
04:54:27,320 --> 04:54:31,500
I did, I, we even probably, we spent all that time doing
this, what happened there.

5587
04:54:31,720 --> 04:54:33,300
Good spot, it'd be like, yo, portal down.

5588
04:54:33,420 --> 04:54:35,800
And I was like, ah, you forgot the money.

5589
04:54:36,380 --> 04:54:41,960
Moxie, the road would start that, Calvin I would pick you
down every round start and would sit there and wait for you,

5590
04:54:42,040 --> 04:54:42,240
bro.

5591
04:54:42,900 --> 04:54:43,760
Yeah, because he's the nose.

5592
04:54:43,900 --> 04:54:45,400
He knows I'm fucking doing shit.

5593
04:54:45,500 --> 04:54:47,360
Yeah, he's better than you just out shoot him or something.

5594
04:54:47,900 --> 04:54:49,060
Nothing's not that easy.

5595
04:54:49,540 --> 04:54:49,800
Out shoot.

5596
04:54:49,840 --> 04:54:51,940
Well, dude, he was out shooting apparently every time.

5597
04:54:52,380 --> 04:54:53,680
Well, yeah, he's two people.

5598
04:54:53,860 --> 04:54:55,140
Oh, Moxie's dead again, guys.

5599
04:54:55,200 --> 04:54:55,600
Hold on.

5600
04:54:55,660 --> 04:54:56,500
Fall back, fall back.

5601
04:54:57,260 --> 04:54:59,240
You come back and get sniped again.

5602
04:54:59,560 --> 04:55:00,500
Oh, fall back, guys.

5603
04:55:00,700 --> 04:55:01,160
What's Moxie?

5604
04:55:01,880 --> 04:55:03,420
Like, do we have to do it three times, man?

5605
04:55:04,460 --> 04:55:05,940
Yeah, it happens.

5606
04:55:06,680 --> 04:55:07,980
Guys, you guys got the name or I'm in.

5607
04:55:07,980 --> 04:55:16,160
or got the mantis like that's just fucked i did say bad she
did say bad and you put it in on our mocking she did she was

5608
04:55:16,160 --> 04:55:23,820
pleading well we saved the venom i was like well we don't
need to care about i was begging everyone to please ban

5609
04:55:23,820 --> 04:55:33,460
hello ah she did say it we have nobody to blame it ourselves
i'm not about i'll just listen to you i'm a noob my opinion

5610
04:55:33,460 --> 04:55:39,700
doesn't matter yeah yeah and i don't know what any of these
people play i They privated the profiles because they're

5611
04:55:39,700 --> 04:55:40,040
push-ups.

5612
04:55:40,220 --> 04:55:40,680
My shit's open.

5613
04:55:40,940 --> 04:55:41,900
You don't respect your teammates?

5614
04:55:42,720 --> 04:55:43,900
Yeah, but like, come on.

5615
04:55:43,980 --> 04:55:46,740
It makes sense to ban Groot as well.

5616
04:55:46,980 --> 04:55:49,220
There's upsides, downsides.

5617
04:55:49,420 --> 04:55:49,980
Oh, bro.

5618
04:55:50,120 --> 04:55:51,240
Whatever it is, what it is, man.

5619
04:55:51,320 --> 04:55:51,800
It is what it is.

5620
04:55:51,900 --> 04:55:52,800
Wait, but why?

5621
04:55:53,080 --> 04:55:54,860
Wait, if we ban, we don't need a ban Groot.

5622
04:55:55,000 --> 04:55:55,600
We had Gambit.

5623
04:55:55,740 --> 04:55:57,700
We could have just cleaned it.

5624
04:55:58,280 --> 04:55:58,940
I wasn't.

5625
04:55:58,980 --> 04:55:59,720
I was never mentioned.

5626
04:56:02,080 --> 04:56:03,320
They banned Loki.

5627
04:56:03,540 --> 04:56:05,700
Because I was passionate about my hella bad.

5628
04:56:05,960 --> 04:56:07,480
I didn't think I need to mention it.

5629
04:56:07,960 --> 04:56:18,880
they banned guys whatever blame it on me i it was my fault
fucking hell good job moxie we're taking blame good job no

5630
04:56:18,880 --> 04:56:28,440
that's some fuck ass see guys it's none of our faults except
for one phrase no we should have banned mantis honestly we

5631
04:56:28,440 --> 04:56:36,340
should have banned mantis no we should have been hell on
period the mantis got 20k damage because he was that mantis

5632
04:56:36,340 --> 04:56:42,620
was sitting to hell I think the mantis was more of an issue
than their hella.

5633
04:56:43,600 --> 04:56:46,400
The hella looks good because the mantis does so much.

5634
04:56:46,620 --> 04:56:53,360
Yeah, I mean, she's damage boosted, perma, like, yeah, but
if, but then, like, the only reason, the only person, wait,

5635
04:56:53,440 --> 04:56:57,640
I did say bad mantis in the first matchup for XQC to...

5636
04:56:57,640 --> 04:56:57,780
Did we?

5637
04:56:58,100 --> 04:57:01,120
Yeah, remember I said mantis is, like, one the strongest for
triple.

5638
04:57:01,120 --> 04:57:02,160
We've been in it?

5639
04:57:02,280 --> 04:57:02,700
First time?

5640
04:57:02,860 --> 04:57:03,500
Yeah, we did.

5641
04:57:04,200 --> 04:57:05,000
Oh, okay.

5642
04:57:05,340 --> 04:57:07,020
Why don't we listen to her?

5643
04:57:07,020 --> 04:57:10,680
Well, dude, I, but Loki, I feel like you could have been
more aggressive with us.

5644
04:57:12,000 --> 04:57:12,840
Oh, oh.

5645
04:57:15,880 --> 04:57:16,240
Doki.

5646
04:57:16,760 --> 04:57:17,800
Doki, no, sorry, Doki.

5647
04:57:18,300 --> 04:57:19,860
Could have been way more aggressive with us to get that ban.

5648
04:57:20,460 --> 04:57:21,180
I was.

5649
04:57:21,580 --> 04:57:24,840
I was like, you should ban it, you stupid motherfuckers.

5650
04:57:25,020 --> 04:57:25,680
I'm not fucking around.

5651
04:57:26,480 --> 04:57:27,080
Like, say that.

5652
04:57:27,220 --> 04:57:28,740
You're going to fucking ban the camp around my plane.

5653
04:57:28,760 --> 04:57:32,820
And then I said, I said, okay, if they run hell out, that's
on you.

5654
04:57:33,200 --> 04:57:34,020
That's on you.

5655
04:57:34,140 --> 04:57:35,880
Yeah, but if it's aggressive, like, okay, it's not on me.

5656
04:57:37,760 --> 04:57:45,000
responsibility yeah fuck is that ducking responsibility you
guys didn't listen to me so i was like i told you so i told

5657
04:57:45,000 --> 04:57:52,800

rocket and follow around you with the hell and fight it with

5660
04:58:11,500 --> 04:58:12,140
you or something.

5661
04:58:13,480 --> 04:58:15,180
Just pocket rocket, dude.

5662
04:58:16,040 --> 04:58:19,560
How are you putting some practice before you sign up for a
tournament, Tyler?

5663
04:58:19,860 --> 04:58:20,540
Oh, wait.

5664
04:58:20,880 --> 04:58:22,260
They had other players as bad as me.

5665
04:58:22,320 --> 04:58:22,620
I don't know.

5666
04:58:22,660 --> 04:58:23,220
It is what it is.

5667
04:58:23,440 --> 04:58:24,160
They're good players.

5668
04:58:24,400 --> 04:58:25,260
Outcarriage you, Moxie.

5669
04:58:26,460 --> 04:58:28,800
Wait, Moxie, was Tyler's first pick, though.

5670
04:58:29,840 --> 04:58:31,660
He had so much confidence in you, Moxie.

5671
04:58:31,880 --> 04:58:32,640
You were his first team.

5672
04:58:33,360 --> 04:58:33,900
Your team.

5673
04:58:34,840 --> 04:58:36,520
I didn't, yeah.

5674
04:58:37,140 --> 04:58:38,060
What would it do?

5675
04:58:38,300 --> 04:58:39,020
I didn't pick you!

5676
04:58:40,940 --> 04:58:41,300
True!

5677
04:58:43,920 --> 04:58:44,280
True!

5678
04:58:44,880 --> 04:58:45,040
True!

5679
04:58:47,040 --> 04:58:48,680
I was not the worst player in this.

5680
04:58:49,300 --> 04:58:51,240
Wait, who was... who was named them?

5681
04:58:52,440 --> 04:58:53,900
Well, I'm watching back your portal.

5682
04:58:54,000 --> 04:58:54,820
That's what I want to see.

5683
04:58:55,520 --> 04:58:56,700
I don't know all the people here.

5684
04:58:57,020 --> 04:59:00,740
Yeah, but you said you were not the worst player, so that
means you know who's the worst player on our team.

5685
04:59:00,900 --> 04:59:02,540
Somebody has got to be worse than me, is what I'm saying.

5686
04:59:03,240 --> 04:59:04,680
They all play fucking support, though.

5687
04:59:04,860 --> 04:59:05,320
That's a thing.

5688
04:59:05,540 --> 04:59:05,700
They're pussy.

5689
04:59:07,180 --> 04:59:10,820
All the bad players play support Oh my god.

5690
04:59:10,880 --> 04:59:14,820
Oh my god, Tyler You shifted up and right?

5691
04:59:15,460 --> 04:59:16,080
I didn't happen.

5692
04:59:16,260 --> 04:59:17,620
I didn't see that.

5693
04:59:17,940 --> 04:59:20,020
Everyone needs to watch back Tyler.

5694
04:59:20,260 --> 04:59:21,340
I'm leaving this portal.

5695
04:59:21,600 --> 04:59:21,800
What?

5696
04:59:23,080 --> 04:59:23,180
Please.

5697
04:59:24,180 --> 04:59:24,360
Please.

5698
04:59:25,020 --> 04:59:25,380
What did you do?

5699
04:59:25,380 --> 04:59:26,260
I didn't know how to place it.

5700
04:59:26,360 --> 04:59:27,020
I probably said once.

5701
04:59:27,660 --> 04:59:31,000
Well, yeah, you didn't, I didn't tell you to press shift or
right click either.

5702
04:59:31,200 --> 04:59:31,900
Because I was looking at my abilities.

5703
04:59:32,060 --> 04:59:33,080
I couldn't tell you what was the portal.

5704
04:59:33,240 --> 04:59:34,040
I couldn't remember.

5705
04:59:34,900 --> 04:59:35,260
Fucking hell.

5706
04:59:35,320 --> 04:59:36,660
You had one thing you were told.

5707
04:59:37,020 --> 04:59:39,420
I was right behind him when he did that was so funny.

5708
04:59:39,580 --> 04:59:41,820
He was like, no, come down, come down.

5709
04:59:43,640 --> 04:59:45,340
Did that port-up change anything?

5710
04:59:46,120 --> 04:59:47,000
Oh, probably not.

5711
04:59:47,480 --> 04:59:48,240
Probably not.

5712
04:59:48,240 --> 04:59:48,720
Probably not.

5713
04:59:49,240 --> 04:59:50,180
Yeah, they were shitting on us.

5714
04:59:50,280 --> 04:59:51,400
I mean, I don't think so.

5715
04:59:51,520 --> 04:59:54,360
I, it was just like they had the better comp in the end.

5716
04:59:54,440 --> 04:59:55,660
Look, it was going good at the beginning.

5717
04:59:55,840 --> 04:59:56,260
Then something happened.

5718
04:59:56,280 --> 05:00:00,380
Wait, Moxie, why didn't you want to, why didn't you try to
hella diff him?

5719
05:00:01,200 --> 05:00:02,980
I'm not hella diffing someone with a man.

5720
05:00:02,980 --> 05:00:05,640
Because isn't hella, but it doesn't hella counter Bucky.

5721
05:00:05,940 --> 05:00:07,000
I caught up with Matt.

5722
05:00:07,020 --> 05:00:14,340

5726
05:00:38,360 --> 05:00:39,480
begging you guys.

5727
05:00:39,500 --> 05:00:42,920
I said it on a task on on third point What can I do?

5728
05:00:43,060 --> 05:00:43,420
What can I do?

5729
05:00:43,520 --> 05:00:44,260
What can I do?

5730
05:00:44,640 --> 05:00:45,540
Oh, you said Markella.

5731
05:00:45,880 --> 05:00:46,620
Well, what am I gonna?

5732
05:00:46,880 --> 05:00:47,360
Yeah, Markella.

5733
05:00:47,760 --> 05:00:48,020
I don't know.

5734
05:00:48,100 --> 05:00:53,660
I said it on attack third point twice three times when he
killed me the first time and then we walk back up Well,

5735
05:00:53,740 --> 05:00:57,960
actually you you died I did this I actually ran.

5736
05:00:58,040 --> 05:01:00,680
I was like I like ran into sick.

5737
05:01:01,140 --> 05:01:03,780
Apologies for that guys Yeah, and you didn't press me
either.

5738
05:01:04,260 --> 05:01:05,200
You didn't press me either.

5739
05:01:05,900 --> 05:01:13,640
I would see you say I'm to kill player so we shouldn't have
any expectations on him bro this isn't like a league man

5740
05:01:13,640 --> 05:01:21,940
you're dying whatever it happens i gotta pick not with time
steamroll time yeah and we did the same on attack that's how

5741
05:01:21,940 --> 05:01:27,720
we snowballed i got a couple hooks hooked them in punch them
into us we got two picks and snowballed i'm saying so you're

5742
05:01:27,720 --> 05:01:32,980
the key players you gotta make the plays and when it came in
the crunch he didn't make them and he did that's what i'm

5743
05:01:32,980 --> 05:01:37,600
saying all right then there I played better.

5744
05:01:37,720 --> 05:01:38,340
I played like shit.

5745
05:01:38,480 --> 05:01:39,140
I'm not saying I did it.

5746
05:01:39,280 --> 05:01:40,400
I just expected better, Moxie.

5747
05:01:40,700 --> 05:01:41,920
Next time you don't disappoint me.

5748
05:01:42,200 --> 05:01:42,200
Okay?

5749
05:01:43,080 --> 05:01:44,640
Is there going to be next time for him?

5750
05:01:44,680 --> 05:01:46,200
Will you first pick Moxie again?

5751
05:01:47,680 --> 05:01:48,040
Please.

5752
05:01:48,980 --> 05:01:49,800
Please what, Moxie?

5753
05:01:51,220 --> 05:01:51,720
Please what?

5754
05:01:52,040 --> 05:01:52,520
I don't know.

5755
05:01:52,640 --> 05:01:54,680
I don't know if I get an invite to this next tournament.

5756
05:01:54,840 --> 05:01:55,060
Who knows?

5757
05:01:56,460 --> 05:01:57,060
Probably not.

5758
05:01:57,620 --> 05:01:58,340
Probably not.

5759
05:01:59,580 --> 05:02:01,240
What if Moxie becomes captain?

5760
05:02:01,320 --> 05:02:02,440
He first picks you, Tyler.

5761
05:02:02,700 --> 05:02:03,380
Oh, oh.

5762
05:02:03,700 --> 05:02:04,680
You ain't going to pick me.

5763
05:02:05,700 --> 05:02:06,480
That's okay, bro.

5764
05:02:07,020 --> 05:02:16,560
okay i'm good bro it's all g it's all g i mean we had fun
low key these guys are fucking pussies all right it always

5765
05:02:16,560 --> 05:02:23,420
happens every tournament three sports they're that is kind
of that's all i gotta say now that it is meta that is the

5766
05:02:23,420 --> 05:02:32,920
that is what happened only reason i've lost so it's three
supports is that why it's so strong so the bad players are

5767
05:02:32,920 --> 05:02:38,560
just playing support yeah because support is like super like
because it's like people just don't die and they just rotate

5768
05:02:38,560 --> 05:02:43,080
like funneling that's what i knew it i knew i was like going
back there and i was like wait they're all just killing each

5769
05:02:43,080 --> 05:02:47,280
other what the fuck you're never you're never gonna kill
them unless we're like doing damage i was trying to shoot

5770
05:02:47,280 --> 05:02:53,580
their chest all the time i mean you do you like i don't know
what you could have played well see would you play you hope

5771
05:02:53,580 --> 05:02:58,880
wouldn't be good into that we bank root also and like you
weren't you probably didn't want to go rocket again and We

5772
05:02:58,880 --> 05:02:59,540
banned Rocket.

5773
05:03:01,060 --> 05:03:02,420
You could have been Cloak and Dagger.

5774
05:03:04,340 --> 05:03:05,580
It would have been good.

5775
05:03:05,760 --> 05:03:09,940
If you had like a mag in you, like I could have gone like
Mantis, I could have helped Moxie.

5776
05:03:10,320 --> 05:03:14,800
How much would it be for you to solo queue the Grandmaster?

5777
05:03:15,660 --> 05:03:16,020
Okay.

5778
05:03:17,000 --> 05:03:17,980
How much would it be?

5779
05:03:18,180 --> 05:03:19,160
By the way, this game's like pissy.

5780
05:03:19,180 --> 05:03:21,340
Yeah, how you, if it's so easy, why don't you do it?

5781
05:03:21,340 --> 05:03:21,780
It's easy, but I don't know.

5782
05:03:21,900 --> 05:03:22,520
I don't know.

5783
05:03:22,620 --> 05:03:23,740
I'll talk to my team about it.

5784
05:03:23,860 --> 05:03:24,680
Well, you're so easy.

5785
05:03:24,780 --> 05:03:25,640
Why don't you do it?

5786
05:03:25,680 --> 05:03:26,240
Are you scared?

5787
05:03:26,360 --> 05:03:28,080
This game is not hard at all, though.

5788
05:03:28,080 --> 05:03:28,720
What are you saying?

5789
05:03:28,800 --> 05:03:29,400
Are you scared?

5790
05:03:29,920 --> 05:03:30,100
It's not hard.

5791
05:03:30,300 --> 05:03:30,840
It's not hard.

5792
05:03:31,140 --> 05:03:33,560
Yeah, but you were able to play Overwatch Rink.

5793
05:03:33,640 --> 05:03:35,000
How come you're not doing Rivals Rink?

5794
05:03:35,140 --> 05:03:36,400
Are you scared that you won't make it?

5795
05:03:36,400 --> 05:03:37,280
I got a lot going on.

5796
05:03:37,500 --> 05:03:39,000
I'm in eight different things, Doki.

5797
05:03:39,820 --> 05:03:40,520
You hear me?

5798

I'll do a Tetris tournament later.

5799
05:03:43,620 --> 05:03:44,760
It could be your ninth thing.

5800
05:03:44,980 --> 05:03:46,280
Buddy, so does everyone.

5801
05:03:46,440 --> 05:03:50,100
Yeah, yeah, we all have many things going on, but we're able
to play Rink.

5802
05:03:50,260 --> 05:03:52,280
You think you're the only guy who has things going on?

5803
05:03:52,480 --> 05:03:53,280
How many kids you got?

5804
05:03:54,500 --> 05:03:56,640
Got him, got him, got him.

5805
05:03:56,920 --> 05:03:57,780
Hang on, shut the hell up.

legends you hear me hey but you're top 500 mickey mouse

5807
05:04:06,360 --> 05:04:07,560
overwatch top 50.

5808
05:04:08,320 --> 05:04:16,440
well you're unranked in rivals hey let me hop on rival let
me hop on leave you hold on i'm still i got time okay i'm

5809
05:04:16,440 --> 05:04:28,400
leaving guys i go to fucking bed ggs it was ggs nice to see
you guys here nice playing ggs guys not last not last i mean

5810
05:04:28,400 --> 05:04:39,620
we made cool 20 yeah yeah yeah geez everyone not fun this
game and you guys were you guys were great teammates so yeah

5811
05:04:39,620 --> 05:04:46,800
no you had a good time that was great like i literally think
i mean dude i thought our whole team was really good like we

5812
05:04:46,800 --> 05:04:51,220
were playing really well like the name worlds were great the
heels were fucking great and that's from the two people who

5813
05:04:51,220 --> 05:04:58,980
like don't play the game like that so literally couldn't
have asked for more in that department yeah it was just that

5814
05:04:58,980 --> 05:05:04,380
hellamantis is absolutely fucked and if we had a single yeah
person that could have like if tyler could have played a

5815
05:05:04,380 --> 05:05:09,520
main tank and i could have went man this or if tyler could
have played any support that wasn't rocket that we banned we

5816
05:05:09,520 --> 05:05:19,020
actually bro i also like yeah i feel like should we have
even like pro i don't know i feel like the rocket ban was

5817
05:05:19,020 --> 05:05:25,380
good it was good i feel like maybe the only thing we
shouldn't have banned was squirrel girl what wasn't he they

5818
05:05:25,380 --> 05:05:30,580
were using it every game yeah they were using every game
though and they were winning every game over hella yeah but

5819
05:05:30,580 --> 05:05:38,680
he didn't yeah but he didn't like do that he doesn't do that
bad off squirrel girl it's not like he's one v9 on squirrel

5820
05:05:38,680 --> 05:05:46,240
girl yeah but it's not but it's not uh but him as namor was
not really doing much versus it was literally just hella so

5821
05:05:46,240 --> 05:05:51,200
no hindsight the hella band would have hit like crack and we
just banned their fucking rocket who just sits in the back

5822
05:05:51,200 --> 05:05:57,380
and plays jeff and we can't kill because they're triple
support like it was bad yeah like well yeah we didn't we

5823
05:05:57,380 --> 05:06:02,820
talked about it but we didn't like press for it and the idea
of the group a made sense uh in our head at the time yeah

5824
05:06:02,820 --> 05:06:08,780
and jeff did less than the rock it all too because they
could have just steamrolled us with rocky all every time

5825
05:06:08,780 --> 05:06:14,460
yeah we killed a few times as well jeff vault's kind of mid
i don't know yeah it's just another little because they had

5826
05:06:14,460 --> 05:06:21,460
the hell literally just the hell of mantis is just too
strong because we didn't is like a pocket character is that

5827
05:06:21,460 --> 05:06:28,980
just like her job yeah okay that's why like um moxie
couldn't do anything because it was literally 1v2 every time

5828
05:06:28,980 --> 05:06:35,840
and then because we're playing double support i can't pocket
moxie i have to be aware of the front line i guess maybe

5829
05:06:35,840 --> 05:06:42,480
that means the next support i should learn would be mantis
so i couldn't if you could randomly learn mantis that would

5830
05:06:42,480 --> 05:06:48,260
be insane for this that's a good triple yeah that's why i
kept saying like we like always target mantis for triple

5831
05:06:48,260 --> 05:06:53,720
support because mantis is so strong and triple because all
she can do is pocket especially in tournament like this

5832
05:06:53,720 --> 05:07:00,740
where it's quite likely there's gonna be a dps that's
cracked and then just like a mid pocket on a cracked player

5833
05:07:00,740 --> 05:07:06,540
is just that cracked player just stomps the lobby yeah and
hella can't fully counters bucky too so like moxie couldn't

5834
05:07:06,540 --> 05:07:15,140
really do much um because hella is a bucky counter man this
is like really my main right now too like i didn't play

5835
05:07:15,140 --> 05:07:24,140
hella yeah it was just a unlucky matchup i'm moxie i'll
learn mantis and on hell a deal all right but the thing is

5836
05:07:24,140 --> 05:07:36,560
will tyler pick all of pick us again he picked me again for
that performance i feel like reason to not i feel like we

5837
05:07:36,560 --> 05:07:45,960
did all right we did all right yeah yeah tyler and our my
record improved more we got knocked out first last time yeah

5838
05:07:45,960 --> 05:07:53,100
no we didn't really we doubled the price pool of what it
would have been and first place is unlikely i think really

5839
05:07:53,100 --> 05:08:03,940
because we I feel like that necros team like is gonna go
insane with Deadpool yeah well to be fair yeah but we got

5840
05:08:03,940 --> 05:08:13,820
smoked by necroses but we were figuring out our comp to be
fair we're like this is almost decided by the pickbounds oh

5841
05:08:13,820 --> 05:08:21,500
always yeah I think maybe we just didn't we also it's just
that people are very limited with their hero pool so it's

5842
05:08:21,500 --> 05:08:26,920
like rock paper scissors yeah and with the fact that we have
a lot of support players in this tournament and triple

5843
05:08:26,920 --> 05:08:34,020
support is meta it's just this team didn't have technically
didn't have three support players no that's actually i mean

5844
05:08:34,020 --> 05:08:39,520
i'm literally i put in to be a support player i put tank and
support but i've been like playing support for like two

5845
05:08:39,520 --> 05:08:44,600
seasons straight now like on all the characters it's just
unfortunate that we didn't have like anyone who was like a

5846
05:08:44,600 --> 05:08:50,400
main it's me i mean i didn't care i could play main tank for
sure it's just not uh i i figured because of how supports

5847
05:08:50,400 --> 05:08:55,360
how strongly they were and how much time i had on them i was
like if i put in for support like that could be huge like

5848
05:08:55,360 --> 05:09:04,460
how many good supports are in this yeah unfortunately did
not work out that way it also is not awesome that i'm not

5849
05:09:04,460 --> 05:09:13,720
gonna say hey it's not awesome that tyler only plays venom
that character is is a joke in triple support that's true no

5850
05:09:13,720 --> 05:09:17,520
it is like if he could we should out him on Groot or
something.

5851
05:09:19,300 --> 05:09:20,720
But, but no, no.

5852
05:09:20,840 --> 05:09:22,020
You sure seen, no, no.

5853
05:09:22,420 --> 05:09:25,160
Moxie, did you saw how he- He was asking what the Groot alt
was?

5854
05:09:25,600 --> 05:09:26,060
Yeah, did you not?

5855
05:09:26,640 --> 05:09:28,660
Moxie, did you not see how he played Groot?

5856
05:09:29,180 --> 05:09:30,420
He- No, I see now we played Groot.

5857
05:09:30,480 --> 05:09:31,800
He didn't place walls when he ulted.

5858
05:09:31,860 --> 05:09:33,140
I want to tell him, but it's all good.

5859
05:09:33,260 --> 05:09:34,880
Yeah, that's why I was like, I put it.

5860
05:09:34,960 --> 05:09:35,540
We put him on.

5861
05:09:35,540 --> 05:09:36,200
He had a good old though.

5862
05:09:36,240 --> 05:09:42,340
He had a good old, but, but like, he was literally with the
support, like, with supports the entire time.

5863
05:09:42,920 --> 05:09:44,200
He didn't walk out.

5864
05:09:44,240 --> 05:09:46,240
I was like, Tyler, walk up, please.

5865
05:09:48,400 --> 05:09:57,580
yeah no maybe we should just put him on rocket he said no i
don't know i i trust him on venom more he's gonna his venom

5866
05:09:57,580 --> 05:10:07,420
is so good i know his rocket wasn't bad we only had him for
one round like oh it was all right it is all right it is

5867
05:10:07,420 --> 05:10:14,620
what it is we could analyze this but we're not going to be a
team together and again after this we should have we should

5868
05:10:14,620 --> 05:10:21,660
have had him in between like learning rocket full throttle
like just this is you in the mines he's not gonna do that i

5869
05:10:21,660 --> 05:10:35,980
mean bro they watch clips no he would have done bro they had
uh hey yeah what's going on hello well you know what's going

5870
05:10:35,980 --> 05:10:42,500
on apparently you guys are still here yeah we're chilling
dude we're a team yeah i was only with that left guys we

5871
05:10:42,500 --> 05:10:53,480
weren't we weren't talking about you to say yeah we were we
were reminiscing about how amazing we did yeah and how

5872
05:10:53,480 --> 05:11:00,500
amazing each of us were during the tournament there was a
lot of focus actually tyler on how deep your pool is of the

5873
05:11:00,500 --> 05:11:06,520
character wait moxie do you want to repeat what you said to
us about why you thought we lost yeah just repeat that real

5874
05:11:06,520 --> 05:11:11,440
quick you want to say that who yeah moxie you were so
passionate Yeah, Venom's ass!

5875
05:11:11,660 --> 05:11:11,900
Yeah!

5876
05:11:14,080 --> 05:11:16,280
Venom is just a bad character into triple.

5877
05:11:16,920 --> 05:11:18,780
And these pussies always play triple!

5878
05:11:19,020 --> 05:11:21,140
Every turn of- I was okay with swapping!

5879
05:11:21,300 --> 05:11:23,000
I tried the triple healer.

5880
05:11:23,020 --> 05:11:24,200
I don't mind playing the triple healer.

5881
05:11:24,280 --> 05:11:25,040
I didn't care, actually.

5882
05:11:26,120 --> 05:11:27,720
Yeah, but like...

5883
05:11:27,720 --> 05:11:31,480
We need me on DPS and Raffle doesn't play tank either, so
it's a problem.

5884
05:11:31,920 --> 05:11:33,360
Okay, so it was just fucked up.

5885
05:11:33,580 --> 05:11:36,200
It is, it's- Wait, but Moxie, you picked this team.

5886
05:11:36,780 --> 05:11:37,120
Yeah, dude.

5887
05:11:37,460 --> 05:11:38,960
You sabotaged Tyler.

5888
05:11:38,960 --> 05:11:47,900
made some uh you sabotaged him actually did say though no we
we need a tank but they they picked the guy before we tried

5889
05:11:47,900 --> 05:11:55,560
we tried but i i feel like we i feel like it was a decent
decent squad yeah one squad i think we had tempo and we had

5890
05:11:55,560 --> 05:12:03,320
like something happened at like it was just hell out of us
up the tempo yeah we fell down yeah really that pocket was

5891
05:12:03,320 --> 05:12:15,180
too good i kind of hits calvin had 31 final hits and then
moxie was 20 i think yeah no it was hell it was just a hell

5892
05:12:15,180 --> 05:12:23,440
of thing bro i i feel like he's right we didn't help we
staggered and snowballed that's kind of how it goes i want

5893
05:12:23,440 --> 05:12:28,680
to go cap i think running down time could have been all
right on you went cap though and then you how does that work

5894
05:12:28,680 --> 05:12:36,860
like like i just touch cart and like we just need to be
better about dying together or like dying on cart yeah we

5895
05:12:36,860 --> 05:12:43,340
staggered like they're eventually gonna get the point but
the time goes down to zero and then like the next like we

5896
05:12:43,340 --> 05:12:49,560
just win with alts i don't know i think when attacks we
should have made let me farm gambit all and then just mold

5897
05:12:49,560 --> 05:12:56,300
it down i forgot about that strat the ring yeah we should
have thought yeah so if it was group versus group would have

5898
05:12:56,300 --> 05:13:03,420
been better if it was maybe we could have they had a man no
we could have banned mantis and then just let xqc play group

5899
05:13:03,420 --> 05:13:09,020
because i could have played gambit and just clean everyone
well is is Groot not that strong then because he uh he would

5900
05:13:09,020 --> 05:13:14,500
have been way better than me on Groot way better no he would
be I would he would smoke grass on Groot but it's yeah so

5901
05:13:14,500 --> 05:13:21,360
what would have happened I think we we were just we were
just we're gonna do go go practice and tell him fucking

5902
05:13:21,360 --> 05:13:28,640
Grandmaster then come back like what yeah yeah Tyler I
believe in you Tyler they took you as a captain against like

5903
05:13:28,640 --> 05:13:35,880
Necros and like other people that like are like full-time
like Necros hit rank one today like yeah but he did

5904
05:13:35,880 --> 05:13:43,060
placements and placements is like rng though it's still rank
one it is rank one but like like beginning it's a mickey

5905
05:13:43,060 --> 05:13:48,560
mouse rank one but it's still rank one yeah it doesn't
matter he's good i mean that's like the they put like a pro

5906
05:13:48,560 --> 05:13:58,620
or like a very very good player top 500 player versus a
tyler yeah some some of the captains were top 500 players so

5907
05:13:58,620 --> 05:14:00,480
it was stacked against you

5908
05:14:05,280 --> 05:14:14,560
but i believe you can get gm solo q and rivals i think i
think you did nope i believe you can do it how long if you

5909
05:14:14,560 --> 05:14:23,880
guys had a fresher account yeah would it take you like in
hours like well there's placement matches now maybe like

5910
05:14:23,880 --> 05:14:31,620
wait like gold or platinum you should do placement matches
five hours isn't the most you can place into off a fresh

5911
05:14:31,620 --> 05:14:40,940
account like gold i think it'd take you like yeah but you
gain you gain like 40 plus i think if you win yeah i guess

5912
05:14:40,940 --> 05:14:46,420
if you win every game or like most games that would probably
be that you should do a stream tyler where you do placement

5913
05:14:46,420 --> 05:14:53,580
matches to see where you go i gotta get to placement it's a
problem how many levels level 10 right or no level 15 15 10

5914
05:14:53,580 --> 05:15:03,500
level 9 i flick like 10 hours it's someone on the account
guys that's his account sharing not bannable no one no

5915
05:15:03,500 --> 05:15:12,500
nobody needs to know no but yeah it's quick play i mean
quick play is the best way for you to learn other characters

5916
05:15:12,500 --> 05:15:19,900
other than venom dude i actually so by the way it's actually
impossible to see what these guys are on screen like i was

5917
05:15:19,900 --> 05:15:25,540
like in the backline i was like wait who's this wait who's
this wait who's this oh yeah and they're also wearing

5918
05:15:25,540 --> 05:15:30,780
different skins too is there a way to shut that off yeah
they all have no skins Yeah.

5919
05:15:31,200 --> 05:15:31,860
Okay, I should.

5920
05:15:32,600 --> 05:15:33,740
Are these skins, right?

5921
05:15:33,840 --> 05:15:34,560
Or is there...

5922
05:15:34,560 --> 05:15:35,300
Oh, wait, there's...

5923
05:15:35,300 --> 05:15:36,220
I know there's cosmetics.

5924
05:15:36,560 --> 05:15:36,980
I'm pretty sure, right?

5925
05:15:37,160 --> 05:15:37,660
Yeah, ults.

5926
05:15:38,000 --> 05:15:40,020
You can get rid of ults and stuff.

5927
05:15:40,840 --> 05:15:42,140
Nah, you can't change the skins.

5928
05:15:42,840 --> 05:15:44,860
Yeah, just visual effects for ults.

5929
05:15:45,580 --> 05:15:46,000
Oh.

5930
05:15:47,300 --> 05:15:48,440
You just gotta know.

5931
05:15:48,520 --> 05:15:50,380
You gotta know which blonde woman is which.

5932
05:15:50,980 --> 05:15:53,180
That literally, literally, that's what happened.

5933
05:15:53,620 --> 05:15:54,440
That's literally what's happening.

5934
05:15:54,800 --> 05:15:57,180
Yeah, that's the hardest part.

5935
05:15:58,220 --> 05:15:59,900
You gotta know which blonde woman.

5936
05:16:01,480 --> 05:16:08,600
man with this game i feel like all like the older players
who like come back they all play the older characters older

5937
05:16:08,600 --> 05:16:17,320
characters don't get better the new characters come in and
they start getting like like a must-picks not true hell has

5938
05:16:17,320 --> 05:16:26,660
always been good well like hell like yeah but then you see
like gambit then you see fucking like we got owned by angelo

5939
05:16:26,660 --> 05:16:33,900
that one map yeah it does suck People literally just stick
their third, their, like, person who doesn't play the game,

5940
05:16:34,040 --> 05:16:35,620
they stick them on Rocket and they beat us.

5941
05:16:35,740 --> 05:16:40,360
And it's like, like, yeah, it's crazy that people just can
win off that, kind of.

5942
05:16:40,860 --> 05:16:43,640
Like, we got our support holds down so well, too.

5943
05:16:43,740 --> 05:16:48,000
Like, if we could have just done that the entire turn, it
would have been pretty, pretty good, probably.

5944
05:16:48,580 --> 05:16:48,680
Yeah.

5945
05:16:48,680 --> 05:16:50,160
I think that's a marble rivals thing, though.

5946
05:16:50,240 --> 05:16:51,220
I think they got a...

5947
05:16:51,220 --> 05:16:57,740
Well, the triple support has been meta for, like, three
seasons now, so that there's nothing they can really do,

5948
05:16:58,220 --> 05:16:59,660
unless they, like, gut support.

5949
05:17:00,440 --> 05:17:03,400
I mean, can they just, like, limit it?

5950
05:17:03,660 --> 05:17:04,440
Well, we could.

5951
05:17:04,840 --> 05:17:05,060
They could.

5952
05:17:05,400 --> 05:17:07,440
If we replay the attorney right now, we would.

5953
05:17:08,400 --> 05:17:09,200
Yeah, I think so, too.

5954
05:17:09,720 --> 05:17:10,380
I think so, too.

5955
05:17:10,840 --> 05:17:13,060
Let's send some emails.

5956
05:17:13,660 --> 05:17:14,720
You beg them?

5957
05:17:15,460 --> 05:17:15,920
Rematch?

5958
05:17:16,520 --> 05:17:17,660
Be like, please, let us go aboard.

5959
05:17:19,380 --> 05:17:22,160
This out of three right now.

5960
05:17:23,920 --> 05:17:24,260
Let us...

5961
05:17:24,260 --> 05:17:25,100
These guys are pussies.

5962
05:17:25,280 --> 05:17:27,100
Ask them to wager us for the winnings.

5963
05:17:27,260 --> 05:17:30,200
Yeah, no, let us verse the first place team just to show
them.

5964
05:17:30,820 --> 05:17:31,220
True.

5965
05:17:31,880 --> 05:17:31,900
Ooh.

5966
05:17:32,440 --> 05:17:35,200
Just be like show match us first the first place team.

5967
05:17:35,980 --> 05:17:39,400
So that means if we win, we should have been first place.

5968
05:17:39,980 --> 05:17:43,260
We just versus the other team in our, who got the same prize
pool.

5969
05:17:43,360 --> 05:17:44,260
Let's put all in.

5970
05:17:44,860 --> 05:17:46,180
Oh, they take our prize pool.

5971
05:17:46,300 --> 05:17:46,980
We take theirs.

5972
05:17:47,260 --> 05:17:47,640
Oh, wait a minute.

5973
05:17:48,560 --> 05:17:48,920
Okay.

5974
05:17:50,600 --> 05:17:54,880
So that would mean that we were going against the last place
team, right?

5975
05:17:54,980 --> 05:17:55,820
We were fifth or no?

5976
05:17:56,240 --> 05:17:57,000
No, we were fourth.

5977
05:17:57,160 --> 05:17:57,600
We were fourth.

5978
05:17:57,900 --> 05:17:58,420
We're third.

5979
05:17:58,580 --> 05:17:59,300
Third or fourth.

5980
05:18:01,320 --> 05:18:13,880
because we got we got semis oh right right right yeah not
last not last not even second last whoa that's true that's

5981
05:18:13,880 --> 05:18:23,780
true we had a clean record yeah middle of the pack i'll take
that what i'm saying is they banned my moonlight main and we

5982
05:18:23,780 --> 05:18:31,560
lost it was a risk they respected my moon night and it cost
us i'm sorry team was it the first time you didn't play it

5983
05:18:31,560 --> 05:18:39,760
um i did one other game of name all but that was the first
time they banned the moon night yeah fucking pussies peek

5984
05:18:39,760 --> 05:18:51,720
bullied on our fucking yeah our new players were not
supports i guess like epic was support but like it was

5985
05:18:51,720 --> 05:19:00,540
harder wait we had both new players off support well it's
you and yeah we have yeah but like uh the other teams new

5986
05:19:00,540 --> 05:19:09,980
players are support players mostly i was saying that it's it
i just yes this is what it is but i mean come on it's it's

5987
05:19:09,980 --> 05:19:17,620
it's harder for us for sure when i'm playing thing for sure
especially like in other games if if the if you put a new

5988
05:19:17,620 --> 05:19:23,520
player on a tank and league legends oh my god the game's
over i just it's over so like you guys are probably

5989
05:19:23,520 --> 05:19:32,840
struggling like a with me it is what is guys no dude it
wasn't it wasn't a struggle it wasn't a struggle it's just

5990
05:19:32,840 --> 05:19:38,700
that hell of man we were just that is such a strong thing
and we just don't have a third we didn't have a third

5991
05:19:38,700 --> 05:19:45,760
support yeah we just couldn't do triple support because it's
just it was just more like a comp restriction for us because

5992
05:19:45,760 --> 05:19:52,260
i think our team was the only team that couldn't do triple
support mirror but we beat teams who were doing triple

5993
05:19:52,260 --> 05:20:02,200
support which is a huge like in rank it it's always triple
support wins triple support against others like because yeah

5994
05:20:02,200 --> 05:20:08,300
because like in rank the best comp is triple support if
you're losing you go triple support it's just okay they did

5995
05:20:08,300 --> 05:20:14,620
have fixed that for sure that it's like yeah it's so hard
though because if they nerf if they nerf the supports then

5996
05:20:14,620 --> 05:20:21,060
the dive is just insane no gotta be so you guys don't
complain on stream about that no everyone complains every

5997
05:20:21,060 --> 05:20:29,500
day because the reason it is even a thing now's because deep
supports are overtuned to shit because they bitch about dive

5998
05:20:29,500 --> 05:20:37,420
also also it's like the curicle situation where all the best
skins are people who buy skins are support players so then

5999
05:20:37,420 --> 05:20:46,820
so they gotta support players happy yeah and low elo is not
no one cares about it that much yeah the casuals that's like

6000
05:20:46,820 --> 05:20:52,900
the majority of the players like they just play whatever the
fuck they want them iron man scarlet witch yeah they'd be

6001
05:20:52,900 --> 05:21:03,960
banning different things like penny and spot a man yeah but
yeah triple support is just a huge problem overall i don't

6002
05:21:03,960 --> 05:21:12,940
know the only way they can like do anything is to fully gut
support as a oh just limit the rules like yeah people but if

6003
05:21:12,940 --> 05:21:18,160
they limit if they limit the roles though there's too many
supports that actually suck that people want to play like if

6004
05:21:18,160 --> 05:21:23,300
they limit the roles then you're stuck with people on adam
and you can't help like you just are kind of fucked you just

6005
05:21:23,300 --> 05:21:30,520
i mean they can do it they can but people will be mad people
it's like an overwatch when they introduce roll q and then

6006
05:21:30,520 --> 05:21:39,220
they brought backs like they brought everything back i think
people just get really mad i never played overwatch what is

6007
05:21:39,220 --> 05:21:45,440
the reason they don't do that or would it be people say it'd
be bad if they did it goats oh it's because goats was

6008
05:21:45,440 --> 05:21:51,560
introduced where people played three supports three tanks
and then it was like triple support where goats was the only

6009
05:21:51,560 --> 05:21:57,020
comp that can win against anything and then they had to
introduce roll queue because they couldn't do anything about

6010
05:21:57,020 --> 05:22:04,840
it got it well also when supports are asked no one plays
them and then every game is just five dps and no yields oh

6011
05:22:04,840 --> 05:22:13,840
yeah that's true i'll remember or or you get a game i once
had a game where i had six support players not great.

6012
05:22:18,700 --> 05:22:19,960
But it is what it is.

6013
05:22:20,360 --> 05:22:26,200
Maybe in the new season, maybe in five more seasons, triple
support will finally be dead.

6014
05:22:26,600 --> 05:22:33,880
I saw like people when Deadpool came out, people were
running quad support two tanks in high Elo and winning.

6015
05:22:34,220 --> 05:22:35,980
Did you see that KG tweet, Moxie?

6016
05:22:36,960 --> 05:22:37,700
No, I didn't.

6017
05:22:37,860 --> 05:22:41,660
Now he was winning games with four supports with Deadpool
and two tanks.

6018
05:22:43,620 --> 05:22:44,280
I believe it.

6019
05:22:44,400 --> 05:22:44,980
That shit's scary.

6020
05:22:45,160 --> 05:22:55,080
whose team fucking won oh my god wait whose team won i'm not
gonna lie metaphor is a snipe i know i tried to get him but

6021
05:22:55,080 --> 05:23:01,940
i didn't know he was top 500 when he played yeah he's a
sleeper i had a a that's the iron fist yeah erob just picked

6022
05:23:01,940 --> 05:23:10,500
the fucking highest rated person he's a little bitch no
metaphor wait moxie's the highest rated person too yeah but

6023
05:23:10,500 --> 05:23:11,980
he was a second round pick

6024
05:23:15,160 --> 05:23:25,180
should have been a first is what should happen so he got two
first round picks that's true he got space and metaphor him

6025
05:23:25,180 --> 05:23:32,740
he was trying to pick me honestly out that would be fucked
yeah but you picked metaphor you wouldn't have got moxie

6026
05:23:32,740 --> 05:23:46,660
tyler oh that sucks oh wow wait who would have been your
second pick then if it was so if pick was moxie into

6027
05:23:46,660 --> 05:24:00,940
metaphor that's it yeah and then would you be your third
pick would have been collazo you would have been stolen doki

6028
05:24:00,940 --> 05:24:18,160
you would have been stolen moxie before second pick came out
was moxie or aura mori oh so you're good geez top uh top 500

6029
05:24:18,160 --> 05:24:25,560
strategists calmer as well oh calmer that's what we needed
didn't we beat her though yeah her team was last we slammed

6030
05:24:25,560 --> 05:24:30,740
them yeah we did i mean picking that that's just picking a
support man and then there's and uh and already too many

6031
05:24:30,740 --> 05:24:36,700
yeah like you you never you should never pick like one above
all for like support first you need to pick like dps or tank

6032
05:24:36,700 --> 05:24:43,600
first because it really is every player who doesn't play is
uh because this tournament already had like too many support

6033
05:24:43,600 --> 05:24:51,220
players so you had to get the highest ranked dps or tank
player i think the draft was good the draft was good it was

6034
05:24:51,220 --> 05:24:58,620
just it took us a while solid yeah hey by the end uh we were
i mean we ran them down we were destroying them first half

6035
05:24:58,620 --> 05:25:03,860
and obviously they switched some things and but like we
figured it out to some extent like we didn't figure it out

6036
05:25:03,860 --> 05:25:09,900
again but we figured it out to where we were winning games
if it was best of three we would have beat them for sure i

6037
05:25:09,900 --> 05:25:21,340
think we would have fixed something yeah all best of one is
just best of one is just all right is it over they haven't

6038
05:25:21,340 --> 05:25:28,920
last tournament as well uh the best of one like you just
don't have that attempt to like learn from the matchup and

6039
05:25:28,920 --> 05:25:36,480
yeah yeah you can't adapt right yeah it's whoever it would
have lasted forever if uh they had a best of three leading

6040
05:25:36,480 --> 05:25:43,200
into the final two i think like semis would have been fine
with best of three though yeah they could have i think find

6041
05:25:43,200 --> 05:25:50,880
best of three and then because it's just one more game i
wonder if we did less if there was a way to make the round

6042
05:25:50,880 --> 05:25:59,840
robin less like less teams yeah i guess yeah this is like
people's favorite turn yeah i feel like every time like this

6043
05:25:59,840 --> 05:26:04,620
and the last time they hosted this were like people come in
my chat and they're like this is the best uh fairy to watch

6044
05:26:04,620 --> 05:26:11,940
that rivals like puts on is it i don't think it's twitch i
don't think it's twitch rival no no no no marvel rivals like

6045
05:26:11,940 --> 05:26:18,980
but yes it is it's like there's like they have mrc but like
i don't think people like watching that that much wait the

6046
05:26:18,980 --> 05:26:26,380
actual training wait so do you uh so dokey boxy and who's
taught who's that before they awesome are you guys overwatch

6047
05:26:26,380 --> 05:26:35,520
mains or excuse me my rival mains i am no yeah i'm not i do
variety i play rivals off stream more i'm just there for the

6048
05:26:35,520 --> 05:26:38,860
game you know i'm i'm i'm just there for the passion

6049
05:26:41,940 --> 05:26:44,500
I literally, like, Moxie would be like, why is she playing
off-stream?

6050
05:26:47,780 --> 05:26:49,120
Wait, Moxie, do you play this?

6051
05:26:50,200 --> 05:26:51,000
Rivals, yeah.

6052
05:26:51,580 --> 05:26:52,880
I don't play League anymore.

6053
05:26:54,120 --> 05:26:54,820
I don't know what you play.

6054
05:26:54,940 --> 05:26:55,560
You play Overwatch?

6055
05:26:55,700 --> 05:26:56,440
You guys play Overwatch still?

6056
05:26:56,500 --> 05:26:57,880
No, not really, but...

6057
05:26:57,880 --> 05:27:00,460
No, they fucked up the top 500.

6058
05:27:00,740 --> 05:27:01,480
I don't know if you heard of it.

6059
05:27:01,740 --> 05:27:03,920
I have not touched that game since this game came out.

6060
05:27:04,120 --> 05:27:06,720
Top 500 and Overwatch played a win.

6061
05:27:06,840 --> 05:27:10,980
So it's like how many hours you put into the game puts you
in top 500.

6062
05:27:11,940 --> 05:27:17,160
so like there's like masters players that are like top 10
right now because all they do is just play the game i

6063
05:27:17,160 --> 05:27:26,800
thought that's fortnite does league have that as well or no
there's no way to leak is league top 500 play to win no i

6064
05:27:26,800 --> 05:27:33,700
don't think so no no no right now it is because the new
season fucked everything up yeah that's what i'm saying but

6065
05:27:33,700 --> 05:27:40,200
it'll get fixed uh but no it's not at all okay yeah i don't
think it's like it's like it's like plus 18 minus 18.

6066
05:27:40,800 --> 05:27:42,820
oh yeah he's not saying that because he's top 50.

6067
05:27:43,600 --> 05:27:45,060
Wait, are you top 50 right now?

6068
05:27:45,700 --> 05:27:46,080
Yes.

6069
05:27:47,420 --> 05:27:48,120
Oh, shit.

6070
05:27:48,340 --> 05:27:50,060
Then you have plenty of time to grind rivals.

6071
05:27:50,420 --> 05:27:51,700
You already got what you need.

6072
05:27:52,020 --> 05:27:53,820
I'm actually dying, by the way.

6073
05:27:54,300 --> 05:27:57,160
I dropped because I watched the girls for like six hours in
the morning.

6074
05:27:57,500 --> 05:27:57,940
And then I stream.

6075
05:27:58,800 --> 05:28:00,360
So usually I only stream five hours.

6076
05:28:00,660 --> 05:28:03,680
I've been streaming like 10 and I'm only sleeping three.

6077
05:28:04,140 --> 05:28:04,920
Oh, my God.

6078
05:28:05,060 --> 05:28:05,560
Oh, my God.

6079
05:28:05,780 --> 05:28:06,640
So it's actually not viable.

6080
05:28:06,980 --> 05:28:07,540
It's actually not viable.

6081
05:28:07,680 --> 05:28:08,380
Oh, shit.

6082
05:28:08,840 --> 05:28:10,500
Yeah, no, childcare is hard.

6083
05:28:11,900 --> 05:28:12,680
You guys got kids?

6084
05:28:12,820 --> 05:28:13,820
You ever thought about getting the nanny?

6085
05:28:14,300 --> 05:28:14,360
Nope.

6086
05:28:15,440 --> 05:28:19,660
This puppy I just got that I was talking about is I
basically feel like I have a child.

6087
05:28:19,780 --> 05:28:21,240
I'm waking up a few times a night to sleep.

6088
05:28:23,340 --> 05:28:24,140
My puppy.

6089
05:28:24,460 --> 05:28:26,740
The nanny, maybe coming up.

6090
05:28:28,480 --> 05:28:29,320
That'd be lit though.

6091
05:28:30,900 --> 05:28:32,000
You say, you said, what'd you say, a nanny?

6092
05:28:33,120 --> 05:28:35,120
We don't have any family bias.

6093
05:28:35,420 --> 05:28:35,600
Oh.

6094
05:28:36,320 --> 05:28:36,980
It's all about.

6095
05:28:37,080 --> 05:28:37,540
That'd be huge.

6096
05:28:37,800 --> 05:28:39,560
What age is your oldest?

6097
05:28:40,640 --> 05:28:41,440
21 months.

6098
05:28:41,720 --> 05:28:49,800
almost two-year-olds and then we just got a four-month-old
oh so she can talk now right yeah the dude the two-year-old

6099
05:28:49,800 --> 05:28:57,740
talks yeah she's a big girl oh wait who did she say dad
after first words first words so most of the time it's dad

6100
05:28:57,740 --> 05:29:03,740
it's always gonna be dad 99 of the time it's data just they
have easier time saying that mouth movement so it wasn't

6101
05:29:03,740 --> 05:29:08,260
that i want i'm pretty sure that's what that means yeah you
won yeah you won

6102
05:29:12,320 --> 05:29:23,380
number one parent right there number one yeah every time you
every time you lose a rank on the on the league rankings

6103
05:29:23,380 --> 05:29:28,440
just know that you're gaining a rank in the parent rankings
that's what i do literally i swear to god i had kids none of

6104
05:29:28,440 --> 05:29:38,300
this matters by the way oh yeah you used to make me so mad
now i swear i don't give a are you gonna yeah the kids of

6105
05:29:38,300 --> 05:29:39,900
your life dude are you gonna

6106
05:29:43,900 --> 05:29:54,400
was that a yes or no dude that could have easily been a no
like a fuck no like do not make these like force these kids

6107
05:29:54,400 --> 05:29:56,000
into that lifelong addiction

6108
05:29:59,280 --> 05:30:05,280
i don't blame you at all if you didn't that would be yeah
but they could be like the best you could train them you

6109
05:30:05,280 --> 05:30:08,120
could yeah you could like start them off young and they
could be the

6110
05:30:11,720 --> 05:30:18,560
could be like i don't play league but one can play support
and the other the other one is like top lane or something

6111
05:30:18,560 --> 05:30:29,400
like that yeah you just need to make your mods yeah dps and
a mantis you just get the get them pocketing though imagine

6112
05:30:29,400 --> 05:30:38,580
you guys are delusional a little bit yeah i'll say this
though kids are like a early age or a cheat code i swear to

6113
05:30:38,580 --> 05:30:45,000
god you you could teach them anything and they remember it
like right away are you teaching them korean no we don't

6114
05:30:45,000 --> 05:30:52,580
know yet so so it starts at three is when they remember
stuff like a three-year gap or something but i don't we

6115
05:30:52,580 --> 05:30:58,340
don't know what we're doing yet so possibilities actually no
you should teach them korean start young you know because

6116
05:30:58,340 --> 05:31:05,640
why korean because wait where does that come from oh what
the fuck you said that to him I was like, does he speak

6117
05:31:05,640 --> 05:31:07,120
Korean?

6118
05:31:07,340 --> 05:31:08,060
I was like, well,

6119
05:31:11,080 --> 05:31:13,000
that's all the best league players, isn't it?

6120
05:31:13,280 --> 05:31:15,600
Tyler's response wasn't even like crazy either.

6121
05:31:15,980 --> 05:31:17,420
He sounded like he was going to.

6122
05:31:17,620 --> 05:31:20,500
Oh, I did not because language is teaching a language.

6123
05:31:21,800 --> 05:31:22,060
Oh, yeah.

6124
05:31:22,220 --> 05:31:22,680
Can you do it?

6125
05:31:23,280 --> 05:31:27,820
How many times throughout your day do you guys use a second
language or would need to?

6126
05:31:29,000 --> 05:31:29,640
Like twice.

6127
05:31:29,880 --> 05:31:30,460
Probably all the time.

6128
05:31:30,600 --> 05:31:32,220
My dog knows Chinese.

6129
05:31:33,700 --> 05:31:46,220
how did that happen i just oh um he i scold him in chinese
because it's more aggressive i just be like stop but i'll be

6130
05:31:46,220 --> 05:31:53,600
like why no give us a preview in chinese i'll be like why
moa moi and then he gets like fair enough yeah and then he's

6131
05:31:53,600 --> 05:32:02,160
like i would listen to that as well yeah and then he he
walks away he's like oh i'm sorry i'm sorry they're valid

6132
05:32:02,220 --> 05:32:03,860
Yeah, because he's a bark.

6133
05:32:03,960 --> 05:32:06,700
He's a weener dog, so he barks really fucking loud.

6134
05:32:06,960 --> 05:32:07,740
So I'd be like, what?

6135
05:32:08,040 --> 05:32:08,400
Oh, yeah.

6136
05:32:14,140 --> 05:32:17,960
Yeah, if you are planning on teaching your kids a second
language, what would it be?

6137
05:32:18,380 --> 05:32:19,580
Always Spanish for us.

6138
05:32:19,700 --> 05:32:22,120
It's like, it's pretty big in the States nowadays.

6139
05:32:22,560 --> 05:32:22,820
That's true.

6140
05:32:23,240 --> 05:32:25,920
It's probably the best, like, second language you can learn
if you had to pick one.

6141
05:32:26,400 --> 05:32:31,200
I did 200 plus, sorry, two years streak on Duolingo learned
fucking nothing.

6142
05:32:31,540 --> 05:32:31,960
Really?

6143
05:32:32,480 --> 05:32:33,760
Didn't miss a day for over two years.

6144
05:32:33,780 --> 05:32:39,800
years i mean i know like no don't think it sucks things that
i deleted it was a hard delete but i had to do it i was like

6145
05:32:39,800 --> 05:32:46,580
this i'm just doing wasting my time wait how wait you didn't
remember anything or it's not like i have like more than i

6146
05:32:46,580 --> 05:32:53,440
had when i started but like if someone came up and spoke to
me in spanish i would look like a idiot that program is a

6147
05:32:53,440 --> 05:32:59,800
troll no it is kind of a troll you have to supplement it's
the most normie bait it's the most normie bait i've ever

6148
05:32:59,800 --> 05:33:02,740
seen Yeah, I have five years on that.

6149
05:33:02,940 --> 05:33:04,180
Five years for one language.

6150
05:33:04,400 --> 05:33:04,820
Did you retain anything?

6151
05:33:05,160 --> 05:33:06,280
What did I say?

6152
05:33:06,800 --> 05:33:06,900
No.

6153
05:33:07,360 --> 05:33:09,620
Well, I'm not going to ask you to speak because you just
said it's horrible.

6154
05:33:09,880 --> 05:33:10,820
But what did you do?

6155
05:33:11,420 --> 05:33:13,260
It's just multiple of languages.

6156
05:33:13,500 --> 05:33:15,320
Yeah, wait, Mox is really good at learning languages.

6157
05:33:15,580 --> 05:33:18,220
Yeah, I remember you were recommending me channels and
stuff.

6158
05:33:18,400 --> 05:33:18,660
Yeah.

6159
05:33:19,220 --> 05:33:19,680
Are you actually?

6160
05:33:20,320 --> 05:33:21,720
That's what I'm doing in third time.

6161
05:33:22,380 --> 05:33:23,880
How do you learn languages?

6162
05:33:24,740 --> 05:33:25,680
I'll link you something.

6163
05:33:26,960 --> 05:33:27,800
Yeah, he's gatekeeping.

6164
05:33:27,800 --> 05:33:27,940
That would be sick.

6165
05:33:28,140 --> 05:33:28,940
I would love to learn other languages.

6166
05:33:28,940 --> 05:33:30,360
He's gatekeeping to the public.

6167
05:33:30,720 --> 05:33:32,360
I've heard of people doing other ways too, bro.

6168
05:33:32,480 --> 05:33:36,680
But after that Duolingo experience for me, I straight up
haven't even thought about it in a while.

6169
05:33:36,940 --> 05:33:38,740
Like, so demoralizing.

6170
05:33:41,380 --> 05:33:47,220
I've tried a Michelle Tomar, the guy that does the, I think
he does French in a couple other languages.

6171
05:33:47,360 --> 05:33:48,120
That feels pretty good.

6172
05:33:48,680 --> 05:33:51,340
But I'm like, super basic level.

6173
05:33:51,400 --> 05:33:52,600
I've only just started trying that.

6174
05:33:54,840 --> 05:33:58,580
But like, I feel like everyone just says, like, immersion is
the best way to go.

6175
05:33:58,580 --> 05:34:05,220
just gotta watch netflix in the target language yeah and
also have someone to talk to as well in that language yeah

6176
05:34:05,220 --> 05:34:13,820
that's like the best way to learn like your dog yeah moxie
what is my chinese dog bro it's goaded it's goaded that's

6177
05:34:13,820 --> 05:34:20,480
why you know it's goaded what have you like be be so serious
like have what have you learned all of them all of them what

6178
05:34:20,480 --> 05:34:29,360
what is that they're that good i'm telling you it's no guys
i'm just saying erob's team band hella against well yeah

6179
05:34:29,360 --> 05:34:37,360
they see it now they see it now yeah they learned from us
they learned from us we're gonna these guys these guys took

6180
05:34:37,360 --> 05:34:43,960
no no we should have private their profile like all of them
had private profiles like yeah but they can watch streams

6181
05:34:43,960 --> 05:34:52,440
yeah but we can't watch their whole profiles how many hours
they have on what and do this i don't think there's wild

6182
05:34:52,440 --> 05:34:58,360
cards that's true i mean they were just targeting you moxie
it didn't really matter to us so we private our profiles

6183
05:34:58,360 --> 05:35:04,700
they would just want a you god yeah i should have privateed
my shit yeah they wouldn't have had a clue yeah against xcc

6184
05:35:04,700 --> 05:35:14,280
your fucking duo yeah he robs rocket is nasty i should see
bandit actually xc see bad

6185
05:35:17,560 --> 05:35:25,180
wait it's kind of crazy to ban a rocket to ban like a rocket
player only plays rocket wait erob seems they can't play the

6186
05:35:25,180 --> 05:35:32,980
else yeah what do you make sense what are you saying the
erob team beat necros's team yeah they did they shoot on

6187
05:35:32,980 --> 05:35:41,040
them actually whoa necros has won the last two of these two
so but yeah and you see how it's a triple support team

6188
05:35:41,040 --> 05:35:48,280
versus a triple support team yeah i think that space guy's
pretty good i don't know who yeah he is he's was in very

6189
05:35:48,280 --> 05:35:55,900
good he was on my team last time he was my he was a tank
main and he igl then i was the supporting tank for him and

6190
05:35:55,900 --> 05:36:05,000
we did we got second yeah he's a top 500 player in overwatch
and in rivals no he's that guy he's that guy he can get rank

6191
05:36:05,000 --> 05:36:11,400
one if you wanted to at any time yeah but he don't care yeah
he's already done it okay we got moxie in the beginning with

6192
05:36:11,400 --> 05:36:20,000
like a sinatra or whatever yeah he did a roommate squad bro
they were literally just three stacking i remember the nyxl

6193
05:36:20,000 --> 05:36:27,180
stacks those were torture people i don't know if it's true
people used to say they'd literally banned the three

6194
05:36:27,180 --> 05:36:49,740
stacking in hailo because of them yes because they would
just run people's lobbies it would be three yeah i can't

6195
05:36:49,740 --> 05:36:54,780
believe you could three stack in rank that's so stupid you
can't anymore like a high like once you're past uh once

6196
05:36:54,780 --> 05:37:04,440
you're in celestial you can't but gm you can and honestly so
like i don't know that ranks all over the place bro yeah but

6197
05:37:04,440 --> 05:37:12,300
you could technically six stack to gm or to celestial if you
want you can't six stack in gm you know six times gm or is

6198
05:37:12,300 --> 05:37:19,400
it three stack only four stacks oh yeah they keep changing
the numbers i'm not keeping track of it anymore i wish you

6199
05:37:19,400 --> 05:37:26,200
could still three stack in uh celestial but i mean i get why
you can't yeah because you can run one support one dps and

6200
05:37:26,200 --> 05:37:37,760
one tank and then just abuse that are you hoping erob loses
or what tyler i mean the thing that you lose to you you

6201
05:37:37,760 --> 05:37:43,540
would have hoped wins the whole thing means that you lost
the champs that's true yeah i mean i do hope xcc

6202
05:37:47,340 --> 05:37:52,780
they're uh whipping the shit of them and not only that we
were we were uh i mean we really could have beat this team

6203
05:37:52,780 --> 05:38:00,780
like we played them twice it was beat them both times fuck
us oh bro that swap was just too too good when did he swap

6204
05:38:00,780 --> 05:38:07,280
to helen after first half i think when we just ran them down
probably yeah um first half they swapped off one of their

6205
05:38:07,280 --> 05:38:14,440
supports to mantis and then he he just told i think he just
told her to follow him that's very yeah yeah i was gonna say

6206
05:38:14,440 --> 05:38:20,100
we they held up the entire third point up we just ran them
down their triple support was not mantis it was like invis

6207
05:38:20,100 --> 05:38:29,180
uh jeff and something else dude it was in this girl in these
turnies genuinely i think the i think the band was solid

6208
05:38:29,180 --> 05:38:34,640
like i don't think i feel like playing a game against the
fucking good squirrel girl who knows what they're doing when

6209
05:38:34,640 --> 05:38:40,700
people don't play this game on your team like you're just
getting tapped by nuts the whole time and needing heels and

6210
05:38:40,700 --> 05:38:50,000
positioning's notice xqc's team is mostly x over like not x
but current and x overwatch players

were literally like dude the red murals and blue murals go

6219

fancy yeah they're like super cute is it colors and stuff is

6220
05:40:12,630 --> 05:40:21,910
it purebred is yeah i think so wait i think so is it
purebred just they're from a breeder i don't think do

6221
05:40:21,910 --> 05:40:29,430
breeders i guess breeders sometimes yeah purebred pedigree
yeah you should get like a certificate if it's a purebred oh

6222
05:40:29,430 --> 05:40:37,510
yeah they are they definitely are let me see this yeah
another one and that's expensive dog if the tournament paid

for it maize is real pretty i like that i i was coming
around bro by the end before right before i got him like a

6224
05:40:43,690 --> 05:40:48,890

the other colors too but i had a corgi just before and he's

6225
05:40:48,890 --> 05:40:57,310

just biased to the colorway man i don't have a great one of

6226
05:40:57,310 --> 05:41:03,990
milo but there's them together oh you hate milo so you hate
milo that's crazy i'll be honest but i'm gonna be honest my

cute those are still adorable dogs and i i i fucking love

6228
05:41:11,970 --> 05:41:15,190
this little guy i mean i would die for him already and i've
known him for three days.

6229
05:41:21,350 --> 05:41:22,810
It's pretty even.

6230
05:41:23,110 --> 05:41:23,490
The two teams.

6231
05:41:23,490 --> 05:41:24,370
Yeah, I was gonna say the same thing.

6232
05:41:24,650 --> 05:41:24,910
They kind of.

6233
05:41:27,490 --> 05:41:27,490
Yeah.

6234
05:41:28,230 --> 05:41:28,830
iPhone 8 user.

6235
05:41:28,930 --> 05:41:30,390
I gotta get out of here though, team.

6236
05:41:30,410 --> 05:41:31,450
That sounds good, bro.

6237
05:41:33,590 --> 05:41:35,470
We win the next one, you know, this squad.

6238
05:41:35,510 --> 05:41:36,310
We'll just have to run it back.

6239
05:41:36,670 --> 05:41:36,710
Yeah.

6240
05:41:36,990 --> 05:41:38,790
Would you pick us up again, Tyler?

6241
05:41:40,550 --> 05:41:41,370
All right, I'll see you.

6242
05:41:41,370 --> 05:41:41,950
Sorry, what you said?

6243
05:41:43,750 --> 05:41:53,490
No, I'm watching this match oh like absurd the fucking who
what pov are you watching i'm not watching e-rob strip you

6244
05:41:53,490 --> 05:42:03,810
can't play cloak and dagger for wait you knew how to play
cloak and dagger tyler no oh okay obviously how do you know

6245
05:42:03,810 --> 05:42:06,750
he kept saying how do you know he kept it yeah he knows how
not to play apparently

6246
05:42:10,270 --> 05:42:14,990
they're pretty evenly matched i think it's because they're
both running triple support too because it's like I

6247
05:42:14,990 --> 05:42:15,890
completely agree.

6248
05:42:16,830 --> 05:42:18,130
Actually, it's literally just.

6249
05:42:18,350 --> 05:42:19,030
I mean, no one's going to die.

6250
05:42:19,650 --> 05:42:24,770
So I didn't know that was a thing until you said it, and you
guys talked about it.

6251
05:42:24,890 --> 05:42:28,490
This is because that last game, I noticed it so fucking
hard.

6252
05:42:28,630 --> 05:42:30,310
Like nobody was taking any damage from anything.

6253
05:42:30,550 --> 05:42:34,370
I'm surprised you didn't, you weren't able to like, I guess
it's because the games before that were kind of not as like,

6254
05:42:34,690 --> 05:42:36,730
like in the last two weren't as intense, but I'm surprised.

6255
05:42:37,550 --> 05:42:42,110
You didn't like notice it before because if triple support,
if they're a decent team and they heal each other, like solo

6256
05:42:42,110 --> 05:42:44,130
venom unless someone's shooting with you is going to do
nothing.

6257
05:42:44,230 --> 05:42:49,090
or dive into you're just going to be like in the back line
building old and giving them all that's the that's literally

6258
05:42:49,090 --> 05:42:54,110
what it is that's what it is you're not gonna good luck i
mean you gotta catch him so off guard they weren't really

6259
05:42:54,110 --> 05:42:58,670
healing there jeff i will say sweet nita was just floating
in the back and i was just almost killing her on mag the

6260
05:42:58,670 --> 05:43:03,130
entire game i felt bad with my comps because i was like
they're probably all over the place because we're focusing

6261
05:43:03,130 --> 05:43:09,550
someone on cart and then i'm like guys their jeff is like i
don't want to say like like just like sitting there in the

6262
05:43:09,550 --> 05:43:18,990
open not getting healed for a while i was i had i i i was
going in the back i don't know who's dps and who's healer so

6263
05:43:18,990 --> 05:43:25,010
it's just see people in the very back oh they gotta be
healers i would just go on them yep i mean venom can be like

6264
05:43:25,010 --> 05:43:29,610
the only i think the only way venom's like i mean i wouldn't
even play him in a triple support in the first place but the

6265
05:43:29,610 --> 05:43:35,590
only way he's good in the triple support is if you are like
doing the old uh like the old tech the one shot combo and

6266
05:43:35,590 --> 05:43:40,450
you're yeah and you're insta and you're also like comboing
with a support old potentially something to get kills

6267
05:43:40,450 --> 05:43:46,170
because otherwise you're just gonna alt not kill anyone be
in their back line not killing you like it's just so tough

6268
05:43:46,170 --> 05:43:54,830
venom's really he's good it's just uh it's just he's got
meta right now if if the tournament was last season you

6269
05:43:54,830 --> 05:44:01,330
would have been killing it last season was venom meta you
would add moxie probably on daredevil or do you play

6270
05:44:01,330 --> 05:44:10,390
daredevil a lot moxie i played daredevil yeah just like it's
got nerfed this season too yeah is he that much I mean, he's

6271
05:44:10,390 --> 05:44:15,290
not as scary as before, but he's no longer a permaband.

6272
05:44:16,790 --> 05:44:20,390
I didn't think he was like, I mean, he's obviously good, and
if you combo them, he's good, but I didn't think he was as

6273
05:44:20,390 --> 05:44:22,690
strong as people were, like, as afraid of him.

6274
05:44:23,650 --> 05:44:25,750
No good daredevil is fucking scary.

6275
05:44:26,050 --> 05:44:26,530
No, it's so annoying.

6276
05:44:27,450 --> 05:44:29,990
Space is yelling at Erop on his own.

6277
05:44:29,990 --> 05:44:30,210
Really?

6278
05:44:30,910 --> 05:44:34,950
Yeah, he didn't hold it down for him to hear, but...

6279
05:44:37,070 --> 05:44:38,490
Nah, space is so good, too.

6280
05:44:40,790 --> 05:44:46,390
I'll be honest if EROB grab EROB was gonna grab me first and
but if you did not grab space like he definitely would

6281
05:44:46,390 --> 05:44:55,710
Easily win every whatever other way so he should have
grabbed space instead No, no, no, you're always gonna pick

6282
05:44:55,710 --> 05:44:56,550
me.

6283
05:44:56,650 --> 05:44:57,210
Oh, talk.

6284
05:44:58,030 --> 05:45:05,910
Well, uh, yeah, the DP space is playing tank He has 600 HP
doesn't really like need to think like I'm like I'm like two

6285
05:45:05,910 --> 05:45:10,090
shots away from dying No, space is like hard at you Like
hard hard IGL.

6286
05:45:10,310 --> 05:45:14,570
Yeah, the best IGLs that you have to get is either a tank
player or a support player.

6287
05:45:14,770 --> 05:45:15,910
I mean, I tried, but.

6288
05:45:16,470 --> 05:45:17,130
No, I was trying to.

6289
05:45:17,230 --> 05:45:17,830
It's really tough.

6290
05:45:18,210 --> 05:45:19,150
Yo-combs were good as well.

6291
05:45:19,450 --> 05:45:21,030
Like, don't be too harsh on yourself.

6292
05:45:22,370 --> 05:45:24,630
I wasn't getting healed the, like, last game.

6293
05:45:24,950 --> 05:45:25,690
Probably way too deep.

6294
05:45:26,170 --> 05:45:26,910
You were way too deep.

6295
05:45:26,950 --> 05:45:28,670
No, you were, like, in Nania.

6296
05:45:30,010 --> 05:45:31,990
Yeah, but I kept on a swing up in the air.

6297
05:45:32,090 --> 05:45:33,050
Like, hey, I'm in the sky.

6298
05:45:33,130 --> 05:45:33,530
Heal me.

6299
05:45:33,930 --> 05:45:34,970
I don't know how it works, though.

6300
05:45:36,230 --> 05:45:39,170
I think you were, like, so deep that, like, the angle was
off.

6301
05:45:39,190 --> 05:45:41,610
for us yeah oh my

6302
05:45:46,720 --> 05:45:58,920
a pro too so yeah space is every team he's ever been on he's
he's like the main igl like he just was he a pro pro in

6303
05:45:58,920 --> 05:46:04,820
overwatch yes he was in overwatch league he's got more time
in this game just in scrims than i probably do in the whole

6304
05:46:04,820 --> 05:46:10,680
genre so that i didn't know that that makes a lot of sense i
i mean i wasn't around overwatch at all like i literally

6305
05:46:10,680 --> 05:46:16,420
never played that game i think i played overwatch too for
like two hours but this game how similar is it at this point

6306
05:46:16,420 --> 05:46:24,080
like does it feel the same there's a lot of no i've not
there's a lot of people who are good at overwatch and can

6307
05:46:24,080 --> 05:46:32,120
still be pretty mid at this game and it also feels so slow
in overwatch now too i think rival is that a good thing or

6308
05:46:32,120 --> 05:46:36,640
bad thing it really depends on how you feel about the game
people sometimes people complain that rival alt builds too

6309
05:46:36,640 --> 05:46:42,540
fast because the thing about rivals now is just if you're
playing in pro it's all about alt rotation like whichever

6310
05:46:42,540 --> 05:46:48,980
team rotates their all it's the best because it's just the
battle of all it's not the really the battle like whoever

6311
05:46:48,980 --> 05:46:54,240
yeah there's like no neutral fighting anymore yeah it's just
whoever builds their old first because the problem with

6312
05:46:54,240 --> 05:47:00,600
gambit which is why he's on instaband is whichever team
builds their gambit all first oh yeah wins the fight and

6313
05:47:00,600 --> 05:47:06,380
people would do that cheesy thing where we'd be like don't
shoot the teammates don't don't shoot the enemy we should

6314
05:47:06,380 --> 05:47:12,740
have just done that we were just no damage and one we
probably would have won i figured i remember that right

6315
05:47:12,740 --> 05:47:15,420
before the game was like before the over 10.

6316
05:47:15,720 --> 05:47:20,020
i was like fuck i've just that's actually tragic because if
we said it there's no way they would have able to like

6317
05:47:20,020 --> 05:47:28,560
recognize that we were doing it in time so how does that
work what is the um basically the luna doesn't heal i just

6318
05:47:28,560 --> 05:47:35,060
heal everything because then i build gamut alt first and
then enemy team can't counter and counter it because they

6319
05:47:35,060 --> 05:47:44,540
have triple support so no matter what because we any damage
to the emmy team and then we just take tank damage and we

6320
05:47:44,540 --> 05:47:52,500
were attacking first so we could have just done it yeah like
you just literally can't lose in your if you use it yeah and

6321
05:47:52,500 --> 05:47:58,700
i figured it out first because i was like oh i should go
with moxie because he's getting 2v1 that was my initial

6322
05:47:58,700 --> 05:48:05,600
thought because i was like okay if i go with moxie he can
maybe get a pick and like kill hell up if i was with him

6323
05:48:05,600 --> 05:48:14,980
yeah that's that's just so tough man like he hey band is uh
hey band is best character and we just against this meta

6324
05:48:14,980 --> 05:48:22,880
moxy would you have been able to play that as hawkeye what
would it mean like if if it doesn't matter if i'm on hawkeye

6325
05:48:22,880 --> 05:48:30,140
i'm it counters any of that like triple support bullshit
yeah i'm the only person like who can kind of play it well

6326
05:48:30,140 --> 05:48:34,300
enough is is hawkeye banned and so look you then No.

6327
05:48:34,300 --> 05:48:36,120
I mean, if I'm on the enemy team, probably.

6328
05:48:36,620 --> 05:48:36,640
Yeah.

6329
05:48:36,640 --> 05:48:36,880
Oh, yeah.

6330
05:48:37,180 --> 05:48:37,220
No.

6331
05:48:37,480 --> 05:48:40,480
If we find out Moxie's on the enemy team, yeah, we just bad
Moxie.

6332
05:48:40,620 --> 05:48:40,780
Yeah.

6333
05:48:41,240 --> 05:48:41,360
Yeah.

6334
05:48:41,360 --> 05:48:41,700
In rank.

6335
05:48:42,320 --> 05:48:42,640
Yeah.

6336
05:48:43,060 --> 05:48:48,740
Because he's like the really the only hot guy player that
people are afraid of in rank.

6337
05:48:48,980 --> 05:48:50,460
So he just one shots all supports?

6338
05:48:51,640 --> 05:48:52,040
Yeah.

6339
05:48:52,640 --> 05:48:53,460
As he hits.

6340
05:48:53,740 --> 05:48:53,820
Yeah.

6341
05:48:54,460 --> 05:48:58,180
Fully charged headshot is a is an insta kill.

6342
05:48:58,760 --> 05:48:59,560
So it's like Widowmaker.

6343
05:49:00,980 --> 05:49:01,120
Yeah.

6344
05:49:01,560 --> 05:49:01,840
Practically.

6345
05:49:02,380 --> 05:49:02,720
Projectile.

6346
05:49:02,920 --> 05:49:03,300
Sounds like it.

6347
05:49:05,960 --> 05:49:12,320
yeah like it's like they banned hawk guy and literally was
the only thing that counters triple support so there was

6348
05:49:12,320 --> 05:49:20,540
nothing we could do besides match yeah we would have had to
match that probably would have been the best yeah but i

6349
05:49:20,540 --> 05:49:24,920
don't think we could i don't i think they were definitely
the better we had a mantis we should have we should have

6350
05:49:24,920 --> 05:49:31,580
early on just been like i mean it's so kind-sighted but we
should have early on just been like yeah let's do uh uh, on

6351
05:49:31,580 --> 05:49:35,840
triple and just force it and he gets like good, like just
improves the whole time.

6352
05:49:36,160 --> 05:49:39,980
The thing is is triple, uh, dude you need two tanks.

6353
05:49:40,140 --> 05:49:47,120
You need two tanks because you just don't take enough damage
to get any of your, like Hey, man, we get, we get Mr. Raffle

6354
05:49:47,120 --> 05:49:48,360
Waffles on Mag.

6355
05:49:48,500 --> 05:49:52,980
I go Groot or something, and, or he goes support and then we
have the two tanks still.

6356
05:49:53,140 --> 05:49:55,800
I mean, we should just, I don't have found a way to force
it, I guess.

6357
05:49:56,720 --> 05:49:59,940
Yeah, but it was too late in the, too late in the game to
force it.

6358
05:50:00,400 --> 05:50:01,400
No, 100%.

6359
05:50:01,400 --> 05:50:01,760
Yeah.

6360
05:50:04,140 --> 05:50:08,360
I've never played tank in like any, never played it in
Overwatch, never played it in this.

6361
05:50:08,460 --> 05:50:11,880
So my understanding of like the rhythm of how you play tank
is just not there.

6362
05:50:13,240 --> 05:50:15,440
I've never like figured out what you're meant to do.

6363
05:50:15,640 --> 05:50:18,000
I just wander around like, uh, okay.

6364
05:50:20,680 --> 05:50:25,680
Honestly, we genuinely, even with our comp being not like
meta at all, we could have won.

6365
05:50:26,380 --> 05:50:26,680
Yeah.

6366
05:50:26,740 --> 05:50:27,500
Yeah, I think so.

6367
05:50:27,600 --> 05:50:28,780
Like, I think it's just a hella ban.

6368
05:50:28,920 --> 05:50:29,900
It was just that one ban.

6369
05:50:30,380 --> 05:50:37,620
one game and then we probably find from there maybe probably
it could have gone phoenix though as well like if they ban

6370
05:50:37,620 --> 05:50:43,940
he goes hit scan and gets pocketed on phoenix like it's not
as much of a problem but it's still annoying i think phoenix

6371
05:50:43,940 --> 05:50:51,040
is less of a problem than hello i am all 100 but moxie
probably doesn't win a one against the pocket of phoenix but

6372
05:50:51,040 --> 05:50:59,840
moxie plays phoenix though barely i've seen you play phoenix
in rank we literally got to we literally climbed for like

6373
05:51:00,380 --> 05:51:10,040
games in a row yeah but i said i'm not like a hit scan i
play all i'm good because i can flex not because how are you

6374
05:51:10,040 --> 05:51:16,900
how are you so good at hawkeye but you're not like a hit
scan because to me that feels like similar like very like

6375
05:51:16,900 --> 05:51:25,320
it's the same skill it's just leading instead of hitting but
you're leading really well yeah i just play project out

6376
05:51:25,320 --> 05:51:33,540
character i play bucky play namor storm the like melee
characters dude i can't i remember the first time i came in

6377
05:51:33,540 --> 05:51:38,360
your stream and i knew you were like a hawk eye player and i
remember you i think you you got your hawk eye band it was

6378
05:51:38,360 --> 05:51:44,140
like fucking probably eight months ago or something you're
your hawk eye band and i was like wonder who's gonna play

6379
05:51:44,140 --> 05:51:49,860
and you were like oh i just my aim's not like that i'm just
not a hits game guy and i'm literally like what the because

6380
05:51:49,860 --> 05:51:54,720
i asked i was like like i'm surprised you're not playing
hits game you were like i'm just not good at hits game and

6381
05:51:54,720 --> 05:52:02,100
that made no sense to me you remember it very well i'm also
on i was also on a bad monitor back then i'm i did not think

6382
05:52:02,100 --> 05:52:16,500
setups are that op like set up sir i was on just like a 10
year old 144 a 144 hertz oh that's a game changer 500 god

6383
05:52:16,500 --> 05:52:26,820
damn well i want i'm still on 144 should i be on 500 you
need to get those max frames bro on the zombies is that

6384
05:52:26,820 --> 05:52:33,440
actually like that makes a difference yeah it makes a huge
difference oh that's pretty crazy i'm gonna watch yeah no

6385
05:52:33,440 --> 05:52:41,720
way if you guys have if you guys don't have at least an olad
like an olad is crazy as well no i actually improved my game

6386
05:52:41,720 --> 05:52:50,480
it's not even like gameplay wise it's like your enjoyment
being on the pc is gonna be like maxed out oh damn yeah okay

6387
05:52:50,480 --> 05:52:57,560
i know the swap from a 60 to 144 what was exactly like that
are you taking a swap it's like 44 to that is the same

6388
05:52:58,280 --> 05:53:08,580
probably 144 feels nice yeah yeah it feels like that no way
i'm sure no no no when i made the when i made a swap i had

6389
05:53:08,580 --> 05:53:15,160
like a vtuber rivals tournament and i won the tournament
with the with the new monitor it felt like i'm not kidding i

6390
05:53:15,160 --> 05:53:21,500
have locked three characters in my back because i bought and
i played like gambit too i would not yeah i would not be

6391
05:53:21,500 --> 05:53:27,940
able to go compete against pros like in hit skin if I did
not have this monitor damn okay I wouldn't it's not that I

6392
05:53:27,940 --> 05:53:35,100
would be diff it's not like I would be diffing them it's
like I can keep up wait Tyler why do you not have like a I

6393
05:53:35,100 --> 05:53:42,580
guess yeah you don't really need it in league I feel like
but he plays games that I think I play a lot of other shit

6394
05:53:42,580 --> 05:53:49,020
but I don't like changing my shit I've had the same monitor
for like 10 years yeah I feel that I'm the same way 144 like

6395
05:53:49,020 --> 05:53:53,240
and I didn't really back 44 was the peak by the way.

6396
05:53:54,340 --> 05:53:55,940
Oh, I have that same.

6397
05:53:56,040 --> 05:53:57,060
Oh, dude, you need to upgrade.

6398
05:53:57,080 --> 05:53:57,540
That's true.

6399
05:53:57,780 --> 05:53:58,360
I'll upgrade it.

6400
05:53:58,880 --> 05:54:00,680
I will buy one tomorrow.

6401
05:54:01,020 --> 05:54:01,660

Thank you.

6421
05:54:53,000 --> 05:54:53,700
Yeah, T.T.

6422
05:54:54,580 --> 05:54:55,300
T.T.

6423
05:54:55,300 --> 05:54:55,740
T.T.

6424
05:54:55,980 --> 05:54:56,200
Tyler.

6425
05:54:58,420 --> 05:54:59,000
Oh, dude, that monitor.

6426
05:54:59,120 --> 05:54:59,860
Yeah, that monitor looks cool.

6427
05:55:00,220 --> 05:55:00,940
That's good.

6428
05:55:01,780 --> 05:55:03,220
Yeah, well, what do you have, Klazo?

6429
05:55:04,300 --> 05:55:06,040
Um, it's, I think it's about same price.

6430
05:55:06,080 --> 05:55:10,840
I want to say I paid like 7,800 for it like a year or two
ago, and it is, I think it's 360 Hertz.

6431
05:55:11,900 --> 05:55:12,260
Asus.

6432
05:55:13,440 --> 05:55:13,660
Yeah.

6433
05:55:13,660 --> 05:55:13,880
I don't know.

6434
05:55:13,980 --> 05:55:19,620
ROG Swift, one of those ones, but it looks, uh, it has more
of like the full border, but it's beautiful, dude.

6435
05:55:19,680 --> 05:55:21,220
I remember when I first got it, I was on Fortnite.

6436
05:55:21,900 --> 05:55:28,000
think you're what you said was the biggest thing like the
enjoyment of being on the game is like it just changes so

6437
05:55:28,000 --> 05:55:37,200
much i really wouldn't have thought though because the jump
from 60 to 120 is like yeah 100 i 60 feels so bad now but i

6438
05:55:37,200 --> 05:55:43,000
i thought that like once you were kind of pushing past that
you just stopped seeing it but i guess no big myth you just

6439
05:55:43,000 --> 05:55:50,940
you just can never go back 100 right like when i went from
500 hertz i can't speak on that because like i had the worst

6440
05:55:50,940 --> 05:55:57,600
144 four hertz so it might have been like everything well it
might have been everything it might have been the panel plus

6441
05:55:57,600 --> 05:56:05,580
the hertz yeah like it was like game changing like I was
literally mesmerized it's like I wish I only bought it

6442
05:56:05,580 --> 05:56:12,240
earlier the is it the like the response time is that what
they call it is that like that's lower so it's just like

6443
05:56:12,240 --> 05:56:21,120
faster refresh rate and it's less like the colors like the
colors of your monitor is like oh that's the oh yeah the

6444
05:56:21,120 --> 05:56:24,800
OLED I think OLED is a big game changer.

6445
05:56:24,900 --> 05:56:28,140
I don't know how big difference like 240 to 500 is.

6446
05:56:28,360 --> 05:56:29,520
It's probably not that much.

6447
05:56:29,700 --> 05:56:30,400
Yeah, that's probably not crazy.

6448
05:56:30,660 --> 05:56:32,380
The OLED is the craziest thing.

6449
05:56:32,580 --> 05:56:32,980
Oh, okay.

6450
05:56:33,260 --> 05:56:34,160
Yeah, I think I'm on a...

6451
05:56:34,160 --> 05:56:34,520
It hurts.

6452
05:56:35,040 --> 05:56:38,000
Some old piece of ass right now.

6453
05:56:38,820 --> 05:56:40,980
Dude, your zombies will literally...

6454
05:56:40,980 --> 05:56:41,920
I have to imagine.

6455
05:56:42,540 --> 05:56:45,420
Call of Duty would be so much better to play on a...

6456
05:56:45,420 --> 05:56:46,340
I'm going to be terrified.

6457
05:56:46,700 --> 05:56:47,480
They're going to look too real.

6458
05:56:47,840 --> 05:56:51,540
Literally right when you unbox it and plug it in, you're
going to be like looking at your screen.

6459
05:56:51,560 --> 05:56:56,400
you're like wow this thing's beautiful the one thing is the
the thing that stopped me from doing it for a while as well

6460
05:56:56,400 --> 05:57:04,500
is most people game on like 24 to 24.5 like inch monitors
almost strictly and like this is 27 i think and at first i

6461
05:57:04,500 --> 05:57:10,040
was like i don't know if i want it but like dude it's who
literally who cares i mean it's so worth it do you just put

6462
05:57:10,040 --> 05:57:14,920
the screen a bit further away like on your desk is that oh
yeah i mean or sit yeah or sit a little further it's it

6463
05:57:14,920 --> 05:57:17,640
feels honestly it feels very similar and it just looks
beautiful

6464
05:57:21,560 --> 05:57:33,860
and everything for the strats bro they're so into it oh my
god it's crazy they're so it's for everything why didn't we

6465
05:57:33,860 --> 05:57:41,620
do that they are they are locked for this who's bc hiding
profiles is crazy like we should i think if we that's got to

6466
05:57:41,620 --> 05:57:48,640
be that's got to be bad next time yeah like like they could
read us all like they read all into us i remember i looked

6467
05:57:48,640 --> 05:57:56,760
at like zoils his was like end yeah and then like i checked
like mid-match i'm like oh like i would have never known to

6468
05:57:56,760 --> 05:58:04,980
ban that he has 200 hours on strange and like five on the
next oh thank god like like and all of them have looked

6469
05:58:04,980 --> 05:58:13,100
through our shit they're like okay well well like if we
don't save venom they obviously are gonna ban venom yeah

6470
05:58:13,100 --> 05:58:19,960
that would be for sure tyler has 2.3 hours on venom 50
minutes on and then two minutes on anything else one minute

6471
05:58:19,960 --> 05:58:24,440
one minute zero yeah i wonder if people just wouldn't have
banned his his venom no they would they would knowing

6472
05:58:24,440 --> 05:58:29,160
they're playing triple support and just he's like not able
to do much like i wonder if they were just kept them like

6473
05:58:29,160 --> 05:58:36,620
fuck it no no no you don't understand no you do not want him
anything other than venom you know someone that put him on

6474
05:58:36,620 --> 05:58:46,620
put in my character not venom oh guys it was moxie literally
farmed him marcy out hot guy farm the of him oh yeah i mean

6475
05:58:46,620 --> 05:58:51,960
we could have won i mean no you did what you were fine oh i
was muted no there's nothing you do with that then at the

6476
05:58:51,960 --> 05:58:59,020
end of that game i just don't play oh my god i was gonna say
but you know you do not want tyler on anything but venom

6477
05:58:59,020 --> 05:59:07,240
because like he went off venom and then moxie literally
farmed the out of him uh yeah yeah definitely or whatever

6478
05:59:07,960 --> 05:59:14,420
because like he just doesn't have time enough because when
he was on hulk all he did was just to the back line and just

6479
05:59:14,420 --> 05:59:22,520
died because he had there was no escape last year yes yeah i
mean i remember that tournament i i fanned out his venom

6480
05:59:22,520 --> 05:59:30,000
yeah you ban that's why i was like you know he has to be on
venom because he had the most knowledge on venom because

6481
05:59:30,000 --> 05:59:35,840
other than that he back capped us on venom and one of the
dominations on that last turn i remember so we were

6482
05:59:35,840 --> 05:59:40,720
literally so confused we're like where's tyler and he's just
the point just starts getting ticked and he gets it and he

6483
05:59:40,720 --> 05:59:50,320
misses his swing and just starts walking away and we killed
him but it was i mean it's hysterical dude i want to get him

6484
05:59:50,320 --> 05:59:56,180
in the range like give him run i don't think he knows that
like if you damage near a group wall or the group wall

6485
05:59:56,180 --> 06:00:04,880
attacks it true like he just pressed alt and then just
pressed left click right click he saved the he saved uh i i

6486
06:00:04,880 --> 06:00:10,140
would have had probably three or four more kills on offense
on one of the maps but he kept he every once in a while he

6487
06:00:10,140 --> 06:00:16,840
throws big wall right in front of me i was like i can't do
anything that's what i was like dude throw that to the side

6488
06:00:16,840 --> 06:00:24,260
like you know you know what else would have been crazy like
we loki would have gotten owned that last match if ruffle

6489
06:00:24,260 --> 06:00:31,920
didn't hit that name or alt on that oh my god yeah that name
or alt was so fat dude that was loki cinema like we would

6490
06:00:31,920 --> 06:00:36,500
have lost that fight right there we would have gotten her
held third point because they had an extra support alt on us

6491
06:00:36,500 --> 06:00:43,100
yeah that that other that all basically destroyed the
support world it just sucks because triple support they just

6492
06:00:43,100 --> 06:00:50,080
out rotated our support olds by the time they hit the third
support out like what the fuck do we do and like Namor isn't

6493
06:00:50,080 --> 06:00:57,520
a match to us alt like either it's like well you name or
alted but they still have 10 more seconds of cloak alt yeah

6494
06:00:57,520 --> 06:01:04,120
yeah I guess that's what's fucked up about supports I think
through the whole tournament I was so I did like maybe like

6495
06:01:04,120 --> 06:01:11,100
four hours of practice yesterday to just like learn like i
basically learned dps yesterday like i i'd only really

6496
06:01:11,100 --> 06:01:17,860
played support prior and uh i just figured that there was
going to be more support depth so it would be more useful

6497
06:01:17,860 --> 06:01:24,120
for me to be on dps and the thing that i was worried about
in the tournament was the with higher level players all my

6498
06:01:24,120 --> 06:01:30,820
alts would just whiff every single time but i think we had
pretty good alts energy ultimately we had the one double

6499
06:01:30,820 --> 06:01:34,280
support alt but it didn't matter and then yeah

6500
06:01:37,400 --> 06:01:42,520
counter the Jeff at the end but for the most part I think
they I think it was sort of adding some value which I was

6501
06:01:42,520 --> 06:01:47,260
and we still killed him also we still got Jeff when you
missed yeah it didn't matter because it's just on the edge

6502
06:01:47,260 --> 06:01:53,380
of my ring so just did less damage to him and he just really
just held up I think it just is a bailout bro if your third

6503
06:01:53,380 --> 06:02:02,920
support stinks and he dies they have two more yeah yeah like
the game the fight's not over and by the time those extra

6504
06:02:02,920 --> 06:02:07,040
support Alts end the third support has walked back to the
fight basically.

6505
06:02:07,460 --> 06:02:07,740
Yeah, literally.

6506
06:02:08,380 --> 06:02:14,500
Yeah, just it's brutal I like that we weren't playing Gambit
even though he was on band sometimes just because I feel

6507
06:02:14,500 --> 06:02:18,040
like it helped Moxie or Mike's pooping itself.

6508
06:02:18,380 --> 06:02:18,560
Oh, bro.

6509
06:02:18,660 --> 06:02:23,740
I'm keep holding that I keep holding down my own push to
talk because I'm like I'm ready to talk But I didn't say it

6510
06:02:23,740 --> 06:02:27,620
say it say it.

6511
06:02:27,620 --> 06:02:28,880
No, no, I agree.

6512
06:02:29,240 --> 06:02:29,820
That's all I want to say.

6513
06:02:30,160 --> 06:02:30,440
Oh, okay.

6514
06:02:30,880 --> 06:02:39,600
Oh, okay gambit only because they were running triple
support it really didn't matter no yeah true because like if

6515
06:02:39,600 --> 06:02:47,320
we ran gambit like and we run into them they just pop a
support all and that just fucks us over it only works if

6516
06:02:47,320 --> 06:02:55,840
they if um if we have triple support with gambit like triple
support gambit low-key uh and then third would be whatever

6517
06:02:55,840 --> 06:03:04,200
but if you just run duo support gambit against triple
support it's just it's just ggs yeah There's just no count,

6518
06:03:04,280 --> 06:03:06,420
like, you can't really, you still can't counter it.

6519
06:03:06,600 --> 06:03:07,520
That would be rough.

6520
06:03:08,280 --> 06:03:16,440
Yeah, it's really, like, the only way is to, like, like, we
outplay them until they just walked the hell out, and then

6521
06:03:16,440 --> 06:03:18,180
we just couldn't do anything about it.

6522
06:03:20,280 --> 06:03:25,740
I also wish I could see, oh, man, now the private thing is
so cheesy.

6523
06:03:27,300 --> 06:03:27,480
Yeah.

6524
06:03:28,100 --> 06:03:28,580
Oh, wait.

6525
06:03:28,740 --> 06:03:33,220
The way that you banning this game, is it like, or the, not
ban, sorry, nerfs?

6526
06:03:33,300 --> 06:03:40,440
is it like each season they'll do a big wave of nerfs or
will they do mid-season they do mid-season nerves yeah but

6527
06:03:40,440 --> 06:03:47,060
it's like very it's very little the mid-season it's like
okay so they save it mostly for the other wasn't the

6528
06:03:47,060 --> 06:03:51,200
mid-season one the one unless i'm wrong the most recent
mid-season one was that not the one where they like buffed

6529
06:03:51,200 --> 06:03:56,940
everyone or maybe that was season five they do that every
day every season to be fair yeah but that one season they

6530
06:03:56,940 --> 06:04:06,000
didn't nerf anyone like at all i've lost track this the
release season so fast because the seasons happen so fast

6531
06:04:06,000 --> 06:04:15,220
too and that's like the hard part how long do they last like
a month two months a month oh my god that fast yeah like if

6532
06:04:15,220 --> 06:04:22,320
you look at it yeah it's a month there's 27 days of the
season left and literally the season started today yeah what

6533
06:04:22,320 --> 06:04:25,420
the hell that's so quick yeah so it's like you

6534
06:04:29,340 --> 06:04:36,140
remember yeah no wonder they saved the nymphs for the for
the season changes because it's like it's so soon i still i

6535
06:04:36,140 --> 06:04:42,640
wish this german had deadpool mandatory i think it would
have been even funner more fun i thought they were going to

6536
06:04:42,640 --> 06:04:47,160
and then i looked it up and i didn't see it in the rules and
then you said it and i was like am i fucking dumb like

6537
06:04:47,160 --> 06:04:55,600
because i think we would have we might have had like it'll
be cooler for comps for sure yeah i think we would have

6538
06:04:58,640 --> 06:04:58,940
Maybe.

6539
06:04:59,920 --> 06:05:02,800
Just because other people have them and they play them.

6540
06:05:02,940 --> 06:05:06,680
Like that dude that we lost to plays, like clearly has good
hours on it.

6541
06:05:06,740 --> 06:05:08,060
Necros clearly has good hours on it.

6542
06:05:08,160 --> 06:05:11,120
We would have been forced to put, have any of you guys
played him?

6543
06:05:11,900 --> 06:05:13,720
Maxi and I both had early access.

6544
06:05:14,440 --> 06:05:15,580
I played two minutes.

6545
06:05:15,820 --> 06:05:17,940
I played against him for like two hours.

6546
06:05:18,360 --> 06:05:18,920
That's something.

6547
06:05:19,300 --> 06:05:19,980
That's something.

6548
06:05:20,340 --> 06:05:21,140
That counts.

6549
06:05:21,480 --> 06:05:23,140
I don't know what our disabilities did.

6550
06:05:23,660 --> 06:05:24,520
That's what I mean, bro.

6551
06:05:24,560 --> 06:05:26,800
He does stuff and I'm like, should I be peeling for this
idiot?

6552
06:05:26,880 --> 06:05:27,740
Like he's dancing.

6553
06:05:29,960 --> 06:05:38,660
bro i also like couldn't even kill him as like a dps like
unless i just like i don't know he's just like that

6554
06:05:38,660 --> 06:05:45,240
character's crazy yeah i was talking as well he was just
like very well i think definitely for sure like i think if

6555
06:05:45,240 --> 06:05:52,160
super does another tournament this he should just ban triple
support like no team can't run triple support that would be

6556
06:05:52,160 --> 06:05:59,480
something i would take that maybe they got to be more
careful about who they like i don't know Yeah, it'll be

6557
06:05:59,480 --> 06:06:04,460
harder because majority of content creators are support
players Or like even out the captain.

6558
06:06:04,940 --> 06:06:11,600
I think even I think captains need to be evened out a little
more I think captain should have been the same Elo That's

6559
06:06:11,600 --> 06:06:17,280
the biggest thing you have a cat necros being a captain and
he's actually crazy But the thing is that like they just

6560
06:06:17,280 --> 06:06:24,300
want the biggest content creators as captains to sell the
yeah Yeah, it's a big it's big name like yeah, people are

6561
06:06:24,300 --> 06:06:34,940
getting hyped up because You know the biggest captain is the
captain makes sense just stinks yeah i guess they try to

6562
06:06:34,940 --> 06:06:41,880
even out by doing the they should make it so that snake
order thing this time around they should have done it where

6563
06:06:41,880 --> 06:06:50,240
like the high the high rank captains cannot pick the first
like cannot pick like one above all is there uh did they

6564
06:06:50,240 --> 06:06:58,180
give is that did necros have last pick intentionally like
was that like uh yes that was okay because last not giving

6565
06:06:58,180 --> 06:07:06,520
snake is kind cool they they did uh it was randomized who
got the order in the snake and necros i think was second

6566
06:07:06,520 --> 06:07:15,620
pick in the snake so he just had like second pickings of
whoever he got you got you dude i feel like i feel like i

6567
06:07:15,620 --> 06:07:23,040
normally do and can complain about these turnies but i don't
i think this is this is the closest thing i've ever played

6568
06:07:23,040 --> 06:07:28,960
like we could have won against we could have lost any match
and it looks like that's happening necros lost and we're

6569
06:07:28,960 --> 06:07:35,500
talking about how good he is as a captain like how it's
unfair he's not in anymore um yeah i mean this is at least i

6570
06:07:35,500 --> 06:07:41,840
have to complain about i think it also depends on which
captain did their research on the players there very true

6571
06:07:41,840 --> 06:07:47,640
because i think flacks accidentally recruited four support
players yeah yeah the flats did not do any research yeah

6572
06:07:47,640 --> 06:07:57,600
that's why his team had like a yeah that's why his team was
like one five or something or more he was like flexing like

6573
06:07:58,680 --> 06:08:06,960
support yeah is i'm already normally a support player yeah
yeah right oh my god dude that strange movement was insane i

6574
06:08:06,960 --> 06:08:14,900
haven't seen that yet you could b hop with the shift now
yeah what like oh my god yeah you shift forward let go of it

6575
06:08:14,900 --> 06:08:24,360
and then you like b hop you just b hop and pop old mid b hop
that's disgusting i kind of like that but that is scary do

6576
06:08:24,360 --> 06:08:30,800
you reckon it would work if they did only one one above all
player per team like total or are there just too many one

6577
06:08:30,800 --> 06:08:38,300
above all players in the tournament for that to work I think
every team had one above all yeah every team some teams had

6578
06:08:38,300 --> 06:08:46,640
two yeah it's just that fact that some teams had two and I
think like I think one team had it was like eternity and two

6579
06:08:46,640 --> 06:08:54,840
one above all's right or they had like two one EROB's team
had has space and then they have yeah they had two one above

6580
06:08:54,860 --> 06:09:04,440
of all players what is marmot is that metaphor why is he why
is that his name bro i don't know who he is who is he i've

6581
06:09:04,440 --> 06:09:09,080
seen the name before but i don't know who he is really
either like what does he stream i don't i don't know who

6582
06:09:09,080 --> 06:09:19,000
this streamer is she's gods oh he's a cod player yeah he was
challenger league and he went prone cod oh oh he was just

6583
06:09:19,000 --> 06:09:30,750
he's just a all-rounder then just and he's a one above all
in this game yeah yeah when you played he's just that was a

6584
06:09:30,750 --> 06:09:39,650
tough one when they ran punish i won't lie oh he's a war
zone player okay metaphor art

6585
06:09:43,170 --> 06:09:55,010
bro i gotta learn widow yeah yeah i think so i feel like
maybe dude like i feel like that's like lethal when like

6586
06:09:55,010 --> 06:09:58,870
triple triple supports her thing I'm a mean mantis now.

6587
06:09:59,110 --> 06:10:00,390
So you get, we have this turn again.

6588
06:10:00,650 --> 06:10:01,190
You learn Widow.

6589
06:10:02,110 --> 06:10:03,250
You might have a permapocket.

6590
06:10:04,250 --> 06:10:04,970
Wait, is Widow good?

6591
06:10:05,090 --> 06:10:06,490
I thought that she was like growing.

6592
06:10:07,510 --> 06:10:14,650
Oh, she's, she's a, I think she's like good in tournaments
like this where like people are out of position and like

6593
06:10:14,650 --> 06:10:17,370
random shit are being played more and triple support.

6594
06:10:17,790 --> 06:10:21,530
When you're starting on this map, because you can get
instant pick first.

6595
06:10:22,190 --> 06:10:22,870
That's what I, yeah.

6596
06:10:22,870 --> 06:10:26,110
So you just do what they just did of get three shots off and
then switch.

6597
06:10:26,510 --> 06:10:26,770
Yeah.

6598
06:10:27,290 --> 06:10:34,910
so it's just to see if they get the first pick okay and
because then she can just swap back it's like the it's like

6599
06:10:34,910 --> 06:10:36,950
king's row on widow with widowmaker

6600
06:10:41,200 --> 06:10:46,940
i hear that and it literally sounds like you're talking a
different language oh it's like in overwatch where they play

6601
06:10:46,940 --> 06:10:56,080
king's row with the the england map you just repeat the same
words yeah it's like on high rise where you go for the

6602
06:10:56,080 --> 06:11:02,360
collapse yeah yeah exactly whatever that is whatever the
fuck that is.

6603
06:11:02,680 --> 06:11:03,900
Oh, you don't understand what I'm saying?

6604
06:11:05,300 --> 06:11:07,740
I thought you'd go Overwatch shit.

6605
06:11:08,100 --> 06:11:10,860
No, I was saying I've never, I've never played Overwatch.

6606
06:11:11,240 --> 06:11:17,400
This, I looked, this game came out and I remember not like,
loving Fortnite at the time and I was like, I am going to

6607
06:11:17,400 --> 06:11:23,060
force myself to understand what these Overwatch people like
about that game because I would watch it and be like, this

6608
06:11:23,060 --> 06:11:25,440
is just like how anyone would watch a game like this and not
know what's going on.

6609
06:11:25,540 --> 06:11:26,160
You're like, this is miserable.

6610
06:11:26,420 --> 06:11:27,600
Like, I can't tell what's happening.

6611
06:11:27,820 --> 06:11:29,480
Oh, and then you watch it the wrong time.

6612
06:11:30,540 --> 06:11:35,420
yeah i mean yeah i would watch like an overwatch journey and
be like i literally could not i've never been more lost in

6613
06:11:35,420 --> 06:11:40,840
my entire life um and then this game i was like i'm gonna
force myself to play for like four or five days and i like

6614
06:11:40,840 --> 06:11:46,500
got so addicted you like break through the oh yeah it took
me like my first like three sessions i was in hell i was

6615
06:11:46,500 --> 06:11:51,580
like this game sucks and i will never play this game and
then every dad get on again with the same mentality and i

6616
06:11:51,580 --> 06:11:56,580
think i just found out the role a little bit i was playing
starlord i was like i can i understand what i need to do now

6617
06:11:56,580 --> 06:12:02,960
i understand the game modes and then it just you know from
there you just keep going i guess no this game is so this

6618
06:12:02,960 --> 06:12:09,540
game is so insane i love it i do too like i usually shit
talk games i play for this long but i still like it a lot i

6619
06:12:09,540 --> 06:12:16,580
will say i'm just not a huge fan of the triple support
lately i think it's just the meta has been still too still

6620
06:12:16,580 --> 06:12:24,340
for me hmm what were you saying oxy what you say about this
game oh i'm watching there every character feels so

6621
06:12:24,340 --> 06:12:32,040
different wait they won xqc1 yeah yeah xc1 and we lost him
and we only beat him yeah that means like we lost to the

6622
06:12:32,040 --> 06:12:40,700
champions and we couldn't our our match would have been
closer than this one in the final i think so too if we were

6623
06:12:40,700 --> 06:12:49,160
in the other bracket our match would have been closer we
need to take a round off as you see as well right we well we

6624
06:12:49,160 --> 06:12:55,260
did did we take a round we didn't take a round we took a map
off we took one map yeah and we got to ot in the push the

6625
06:12:55,260 --> 06:13:03,740
card and these guys didn't even get anywhere different map
this map kind what yeah it really was just down to down to

6626
06:13:03,740 --> 06:13:12,460
picks i suppose i mean she just had the perfect triple
support and also calvin yeah he had it even bought calvin

6627
06:13:12,460 --> 06:13:23,800
well ggs i had a lot of fun regardless yeah i like playing
in the last tournament and playing in this i've i agree with

6628
06:13:23,800 --> 06:13:29,360
you guys the structure is so good like they're so fun to
play in at least i find i find them so fun to play even

6629
06:13:29,360 --> 06:13:35,280
though i'm like kind of don't know what i'm doing a lot of
the time but like you were cooking too much to say that i'm

6630
06:13:35,280 --> 06:13:42,480
not kidding yeah no no you have way too many great plays to
like if you played this game played this game like i need

6631
06:13:42,480 --> 06:13:48,740
some coaching when you coaching me i gotta i gotta get out
of silver oh i'd play with you i'd get on my alt and run

6632
06:13:48,740 --> 06:13:56,780
games if you want hell yeah be fun cod is like cod's having
a weird year where everyone just decided as a group to not

6633
06:13:56,780 --> 06:14:03,960
buy the game this year um so i've kind of got an open year
ahead of me i'm trying to figure out what to do so if rivals

6634
06:14:03,960 --> 06:14:11,600
is the place to be then i'll play some rivals i'm super down
let's run it up man i'm dead yeah cod's been uh heading down

6635
06:14:11,600 --> 06:14:18,320
that path for a long time i feel like yeah the last year was
actually really good like i had the most view i'm like

6636
06:14:18,320 --> 06:14:27,220
mainly youtube more than stream i would say i had the most
views i've ever had last year um but yeah this year it's

6637
06:14:27,220 --> 06:14:31,980
just everyone just gave up Two million subscribers with just
zombies?

6638
06:14:32,620 --> 06:14:33,020
Yeah.

6639
06:14:33,300 --> 06:14:34,980
Oh, now I understand Tyler.

6640
06:14:37,560 --> 06:14:38,580
You're doing the same thing.

6641
06:14:38,720 --> 06:14:39,960
There's no way.

6642
06:14:40,320 --> 06:14:42,280
I was just like, oh, what?

6643
06:14:42,400 --> 06:14:44,000
You guys aren't buying car no more?

6644
06:14:44,100 --> 06:14:46,200
And then I looked it up and I was like, oh, my God.

6645
06:14:47,020 --> 06:14:50,160
How do your videos do this year with everyone saying they're
not buying it, I guess?

6646
06:14:51,040 --> 06:14:52,080
What was I sorry?

6647
06:14:52,720 --> 06:14:57,800
Like, how do the videos do in comparison from like last year
with you saying everyone like isn't really, they're kind of

6648
06:14:57,800 --> 06:14:58,800
like almost boycotting it.

6649
06:14:59,120 --> 06:15:03,520
I'm getting like 10 to 20% of the views that I was getting
last year.

6650
06:15:04,120 --> 06:15:04,400
Oh, wow.

6651
06:15:04,520 --> 06:15:04,840
That's tough.

6652
06:15:05,200 --> 06:15:05,400
Yeah.

6653
06:15:05,700 --> 06:15:11,460
Like it's like a big, like we did, did a hundred million
views in Q4 last year.

6654
06:15:11,680 --> 06:15:15,440
And this year we've done like 10 mil.

6655
06:15:16,340 --> 06:15:16,840
Oh, wow.

6656
06:15:17,260 --> 06:15:17,760
That is brutal.

6657
06:15:17,860 --> 06:15:18,000
Yeah.

6658
06:15:18,160 --> 06:15:19,220
I mean, it's not.

6659
06:15:19,320 --> 06:15:20,400
I mean, it's absolutely not brutal.

6660
06:15:20,560 --> 06:15:25,680
But that's, that's still, you know, I mean, you know, they
still do really well.

6661
06:15:26,040 --> 06:15:27,520
Like your videos still do really well.

6662
06:15:29,120 --> 06:15:36,820
another cod zombies and it'll be up i'm kind of terrified of
that i need a break i'm like that's the thing though as well

6663
06:15:36,820 --> 06:15:42,900
is cod's been doing it's been the same cycle for like 20
years at this point right so everyone's just a bit tired of

6664
06:15:42,900 --> 06:15:51,720
the same old yeah same thing so there's no zombies in this
coming cod and no zombies in the cod after that so like cod

6665
06:15:51,720 --> 06:16:01,680
2026 and cod 2027 will not have zombies so i'm like but i'm
a free agent looking to roam around wait gooning is ruining

6666
06:16:01,680 --> 06:16:10,400
your life yeah that's true that's true what i'm you know i'm
just how can there be cod without zombies it's called

6667
06:16:10,400 --> 06:16:16,400
without zombies like every other year oh like the trailer
cards are they they used to be more for the last five years

6668
06:16:16,400 --> 06:16:22,960
straight they've had zombies every year they've just like
forced it in yeah um but yeah there's gonna be it's gonna be

6669
06:16:22,960 --> 06:16:31,860
like the the next card is probably modern warfare 4 and so
that will have like spec ops or something like something

6670
06:16:31,860 --> 06:16:37,360
like that to be fair someone made a good point in my chat
right now too like it's it's just like these last like year

6671
06:16:37,360 --> 06:16:43,320
or two have been a pretty good year for games as well like
yeah i remember a few years back people bitching literally

6672
06:16:43,320 --> 06:16:47,580
not before fortnite came out and then for a while obviously
i'm biased gotta play that game but like and then for a few

6673
06:16:47,580 --> 06:16:52,880
years before rivals i feel like people were just like the
fuck is there to play like single player games have been

6674
06:16:52,880 --> 06:17:02,000
doing really well uh rivals did i would say decently well i
feel of people they were like thank god there's a game like

6675
06:17:02,000 --> 06:17:11,760
yeah it was a wasteland and then rivals was just like
actually good no 100 i mean it was there's been a lot dude

6676
06:17:11,760 --> 06:17:17,600
and that mixed with people getting frustrated about god like
i mean understandably so frustrated is it makes a lot of

6677
06:17:17,600 --> 06:17:23,880
sense i tried some warframe at the end of last year people
were really telling me that warframe would be fun because

6678
06:17:23,880 --> 06:17:30,300
i've played a good amount of destiny so they're kind of
similar but was it good not good sounds like you're gonna

6679
06:17:30,300 --> 06:17:38,660
say it well no i i enjoyed it a lot it's just a big time
commitment that's the the main thing is you just can sink so

6680
06:17:38,660 --> 06:17:44,460
much time into those sorts of games there's infinite
infinite grind i guess that's the same with with something

6681
06:17:44,460 --> 06:17:51,460
like a rivals or something but guys it was been a nice talk
i want to call it here now that the tournament's yeah peace

6682
06:17:51,460 --> 06:18:01,020
and out understand guys that's all i gotta say yeah hey i
think we did i think we did swell especially not being one

6683
06:18:01,020 --> 06:18:06,680
of those pussies playing triple support yeah yeah we didn't
push yeah and not hiding our accounts not having yeah we

6684
06:18:06,680 --> 06:18:12,320
didn't even hide our account we let them we're looking at
our weaknesses and strengths yeah and we didn't put tyler

6685
06:18:12,320 --> 06:18:20,700
one on rocket true sure that was our biggest downfall wait
before before we go moxie you not want me to i can't i don't

06:20:44,400 --> 06:20:49,740
tomorrow but as always everybody stay hydrated posture check
it up i'm around to get that blood flowing me stay up from

6702
06:20:49,740 --> 06:20:57,600
me head to bed cause you deserve it i also think like you
know um our team did good overall like we everyone had to we

6703
06:20:57,600 --> 06:21:00,300
had like three new players.

6704
06:21:01,500 --> 06:21:06,360
While other teams had like one or two new players, we had
like three new players.

6705
06:21:06,880 --> 06:21:10,860
So it's like more so like, and their new players were mostly
on support too.

6706
06:21:11,080 --> 06:21:16,520
So it's like, it's definitely a lot harder.

6707
06:21:16,700 --> 06:21:24,160
And I think we were like one, we were one of the two teams
that never played a triple support too.

6708
06:21:24,400 --> 06:21:26,660
Like, no, we did try, but we're like, we can't.

6709
06:21:27,120 --> 06:21:35,120
Like, our team comp does not allow our team our hero
restriction um it's support easiest yes support is the

6710
06:21:35,120 --> 06:21:42,260
easiest role to play for a new character because there's two
there's like three support characters that you can play if

6711
06:21:42,260 --> 06:21:49,800
you don't know how to aim essentially there's three
characters that you can play if you're just not an aimer and

6712
06:21:49,800 --> 06:21:56,520
um and the and then we also staggered a lot because our new
players didn't know how to die on point which was also like

6713
06:21:56,520 --> 06:22:01,680
a little bit of a problem um But we were able to, like, we
did really well, too.

6714
06:22:01,740 --> 06:22:08,520
We did really well for it, despite, like, despite all of
that.

6715
06:22:08,620 --> 06:22:10,400
And I'm proud of my team for it.

6716
06:22:11,440 --> 06:22:12,340
I'm proud of it.

6717
06:22:12,360 --> 06:22:15,240
We all started talking a lot more, too, as well.

6718
06:22:15,820 --> 06:22:17,380
Jeff, Cloak, and Dagger, and Rocket.

6719
06:22:17,480 --> 06:22:20,960
They're basically beginner-friendly characters for people
who are new.

6720
06:22:21,600 --> 06:22:27,280
I think XQC's team had, like, two new players, or one new
player, essentially.

6721
06:22:27,380 --> 06:22:28,160
Yeah, one new player.

6722
06:22:29,020 --> 06:22:35,380
Aspen and Warren are both top 500 players, too, and
Overwatch, so they learn really fast in general.

6723
06:22:35,600 --> 06:22:40,840
And I know they play rivals, they play rivals, like, too,
before in the past.

6724
06:22:44,000 --> 06:22:45,720
So their team was hard.

6725
06:22:46,060 --> 06:22:47,460
I mean, we got really close.

6726
06:22:47,580 --> 06:22:47,980
And Calvin.

6727
06:22:48,140 --> 06:22:48,660
I forgot Calvin.

6728
06:22:49,860 --> 06:22:52,140
Calvin's just good at every game he touches.

6729
06:22:52,440 --> 06:22:54,520
He's just a prodigy when it comes to aiming.

6730
06:22:55,700 --> 06:22:56,940
And XC is a good tank player.

6731
06:22:57,020 --> 06:22:57,860
He is a good tank player.

6732
06:22:58,780 --> 06:23:07,340
surprised that he won um I'm not surprised he won because
like overall his team is very strong um and um they all

6733
06:23:07,340 --> 06:23:14,080
performed really really well and um my team performed really
well because we got really really close matches against him

6734
06:23:14,080 --> 06:23:21,500
yeah we got really close matches against I think if we were
in the second bracket uh I think if we were in the other

6735
06:23:21,500 --> 06:23:29,520
bracket against EROB we might have had a chance maybe i
don't know maybe i think because like they didn't have a

6736
06:23:29,520 --> 06:23:37,140
player like calvin uh yeah they didn't have a player like
calvin they had a punisher player but not like calvin level

6737
06:23:37,140 --> 06:23:47,080
of insanity yeah but overall that's my take on the
tournament very fun tournament uh very fun yeah but erupt's

6738
06:23:47,080 --> 06:23:55,160
team they got rolled on the second map we pushed all the way
um we pushed all the for our convoy.

6739
06:23:55,980 --> 06:23:59,160
But EROB's team struggled on convoy against...

6740
06:23:59,160 --> 06:23:59,860
Should have banned Hela!

6741
06:24:00,000 --> 06:24:00,540
I know!

6742
06:24:01,100 --> 06:24:01,680
I know!

6743
06:24:02,060 --> 06:24:03,660
I was like, Hela, Hela, Hela!

6744
06:24:04,300 --> 06:24:07,580
And then they're like, Oh, I'm gonna ban this!

6745
06:24:07,860 --> 06:24:08,760
And I was like, What?

6746
06:24:10,060 --> 06:24:10,940
That's on you!

6747
06:24:11,040 --> 06:24:14,580
If they play Hela and we get shit on, that's on you!

6748
06:24:14,800 --> 06:24:15,280
I...

6749
06:24:17,860 --> 06:24:18,980
I did...

6750
06:24:18,980 --> 06:24:20,540
I warned them.

6751
06:24:21,000 --> 06:24:23,180
I warned them!

6752
06:24:26,840 --> 06:24:29,440
I was so aggressive.

6753
06:24:30,180 --> 06:24:30,980
Come on.

6754
06:24:35,660 --> 06:24:36,260
I...

6755
06:24:36,260 --> 06:24:38,060
That's on you.

6756
06:24:39,220 --> 06:24:40,340
They didn't trust me.

6757
06:24:40,400 --> 06:24:42,460
Moxie trusted me on all the bands.

6758
06:24:42,940 --> 06:24:44,440
And then the one band.

6759
06:24:44,780 --> 06:24:48,240
The one band that I was like, you gotta do it, man.

6760
06:24:48,340 --> 06:24:49,680
You gotta do it.

6761
06:24:49,940 --> 06:24:52,600
This map is so good for hell yeah.

6762
06:24:52,920 --> 06:25:00,200
And then he was like, nah because he was like doki what do
you think doki and i was like yeah do that

6763
06:25:06,760 --> 06:25:10,480
brady thank you the super chat thank you thank you

6764
06:25:13,820 --> 06:25:22,180
um but it was fun it was fun my brain was so tired
micromanaging though it was like because like I have to,

6765
06:25:22,640 --> 06:25:29,500
because like in the other tournaments, when I IGL, I'm
playing with people who like have played Rivals before or we

6766
06:25:29,500 --> 06:25:30,800
like practice with people.

6767
06:25:31,260 --> 06:25:35,040
So like I don't have to actually like change the way IGL.

6768
06:25:35,320 --> 06:25:43,040
But for this one, it was, because like, when I'll be like,
oh, oh, you know, usually like my other support would know

6769
06:25:43,040 --> 06:25:43,880
what I mean.

6770
06:25:44,260 --> 06:25:48,680
But then like, I think like he got, he was confused about
saying he should ult or not.

6771
06:25:50,820 --> 06:25:59,000
Yeah, So it was like, I had to like be super specific and
also be like, I have to like, at that one point, I just

6772
06:25:59,000 --> 06:26:02,300
called them Luna because I was like, I keep forgetting your
name.

6773
06:26:02,440 --> 06:26:03,020
I'm sorry.

6774
06:26:06,340 --> 06:26:06,640
Oh, yeah.

6775
06:26:06,640 --> 06:26:08,320
And I also mentioned the band for Mantis.

6776
06:26:08,500 --> 06:26:10,780
I literally, oh my God.

6777
06:26:10,980 --> 06:26:15,900
I literally mentioned the two bands that we should do would
be Mantis Hela and I got ignored.

6778
06:26:16,320 --> 06:26:21,340
I, I got ignored.

6779
06:26:21,360 --> 06:26:47,320
ignored the two bends the two bends um but but in the end
yeah I told I warned them I warned them all I prophesied but

6780
06:26:47,320 --> 06:26:56,780
the team was super wavy it was it was fun I had fun time I

I thought this tournament was really fun.

6799
06:28:03,420 --> 06:28:06,920
I went in just hoping we didn't get knocked out first time.

6800
06:28:07,180 --> 06:28:08,120
Or lose every game.

6801
06:28:08,440 --> 06:28:09,140
And you know what?

6802
06:28:09,880 --> 06:28:11,260
We didn't get knocked out first.

6803
06:28:12,700 --> 06:28:12,980
We didn't.

6804
06:28:13,680 --> 06:28:14,680
That's a win.

6805
06:28:14,860 --> 06:28:15,580
I was worried.

6806
06:28:15,700 --> 06:28:16,340
I was worried.

6807
06:28:16,720 --> 06:28:22,600
I feel like I'm usually cursed when it comes to content
creator non-VTuber Marvel Rivals tournaments.

6808
06:28:23,220 --> 06:28:26,900
Like, if it was a VTuber Marvel Rivals tournament, that's
fine.

6809
06:28:27,560 --> 06:28:34,740
content creator marvel rivals tournament i felt like i've
been i'm cursed in a way where like it was like either last

I knew it was going to be really fun.

6821
06:29:08,300 --> 06:29:10,640
But yeah, anyway, I'm fucking, I'm yapping a lot.

6822
06:29:11,000 --> 06:29:11,900
But it's because I had a lot of fun.

6823
06:29:12,000 --> 06:29:13,780
So I just want to yapp a lot.

6824

GGs to my team.

6829
06:29:26,420 --> 06:29:27,440
Everyone did really well.

6830
06:29:27,560 --> 06:29:33,380
Everyone learned so fast, like three of our players, three
of our players had less than 15 hours.

6831
06:29:33,540 --> 06:29:35,340
Like, less than 10 hours, actually.

6832
06:29:35,800 --> 06:29:39,060
Three of our players had less than 10 hours on this game.

6833
06:29:39,560 --> 06:29:45,000
And they did really well in the environment that we were in.

6834
06:29:45,280 --> 06:29:47,440
Like, we literally had...

6835
06:29:48,760 --> 06:29:51,420
It was just me and Moxie that had...

6836
06:29:51,420 --> 06:29:53,080
Like, I guess Colby, too.

6837
06:29:53,460 --> 06:29:53,920
But it was...

6838
06:29:53,920 --> 06:29:59,940
Yeah, Colby, me and Moxie had experience in, like, battle
royale slash shooters well not shooters but i guess like

6839
06:29:59,940 --> 06:30:06,660
