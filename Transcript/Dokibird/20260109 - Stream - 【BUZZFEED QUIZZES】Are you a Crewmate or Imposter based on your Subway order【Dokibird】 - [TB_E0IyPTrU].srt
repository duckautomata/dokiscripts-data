as the hours passed by it progressed so fast.

10
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,440

By the end of the day, I was like, it's so cold.

13
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,800
Why is it so cold?

14
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,580
I was like, how do I'm in my blankets?

15
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,960
And I looked at it, but I was like, oh my God, it's at like
30 degrees.

16
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,080
I'm like, like my heater.

17
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,240

18
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:48,780

i think i like sweated it out by yesterday by wednesday um i

19
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:54,900
had to cancel god of war i know god of war is fucking cursed
as hell i was so sad um because i was actually really

20
00:05:54,900 --> 00:06:03,860
looking forward to starting god of war ragnarok um yesterday
but like i was so out of it like i'm out of it now today as

21
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:10,660
well but i'm like I'm doing fucking Buzzfeed questions like
I'm doing Buzzfeed quizzes like that does not it does not

22
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:16,820
require a lot of brain power to write Buzzfeed quizzes so
I'm pretty sure it doesn't take a lot to fucking answer

23
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:23,020
Buzzfeed quizzes so I'm like that's fine I can stream this
um but like you guys might be like oh you sound you don't

24
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:30,000
sound too good yesterday was so fucking bad like I was
literally like barely conscious I think that's the worst

25
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:39,080
part the worst part is like I still had sick because I
couldn't get a dog sitter um this last minute like you know

26
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:44,560
that because like you know it's like I'm like I'm sick right
now and then like my usual dog sitter um wasn't free so I

27
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:52,400
was like okay I got tough in this outside so I had to like
walk him and feed him and like you know do all that shit um

28
00:06:52,400 --> 00:07:01,980
um while I was like barely alive I was literally I walked
fed him and yeah I mean he doesn't even have to pay red the

29
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:09,860
least he could do is take care of me when i'm sick um anyway
so uh basically every like when i walk him and fed him i

30
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:18,780
literally just passed out uh uh i passed out like right
after and all i did was just sleep uh hydrate and then poop

31
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:26,540
because i don't know i was so happy when i was pooping um i
was like thank god because that means you're flushing for

32
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:31,900
those who don't know the reason that it's good when you're
when you're pooping a lot when you're sick because you're

33
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:39,400
flushing out all the bacteria out that's like causing like
your sickness so now I was like oh my god thank fucking god

34
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:47,800
that means I'm like you know I'm like flushing it out faster
too so I'm like please let it keep happening so I can flush

35
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:57,380
it out faster a little TMI a little TMI but it's a good
thing when you're pooping if you're sick Because that means

36
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:01,940
your body is getting rid of all the bacteria in your body.

37
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,480
Like actually getting it out of your system.

38
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,620

51
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:42,240
want to be constipated when uh when you're sick because
that's not good that means you're keeping the sickness

52
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:49,160
inside of you and that's not good for your that's not good
for for your fucking body who told you this lie google

Because you know how like Google uses AI now for like Google
searches?

109
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:20,490
They just do a summary of like the top results, but
sometimes it's not true.

110
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:26,750
I don't remember what it was, but I remember when they first
tested out uh when they first tested out the ai search

111
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:33,750
function for google and then it was like absolutely wrong of
what you're supposed to do um yeah apparently the summaries

112
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:41,990
are not accurate at all what was it what was the thing that
that went viral um that uh the ai summary thing when they

113
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:51,470
first popped up i forgot what it was but uh people were like
don't do this don't use the summary oh is it the the glue oh

114
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:58,230
oh yeah putting glue on your pizza is good as a good idea i
think i remember how they googled it too yeah they would

Happy birthday dear.

155
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:06,640
Uh-huh.

156
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,420
Happy birthday to you.

157
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:08,900
Yeah!

158
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,140
Happy birthday!

159
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,780
Um, but yeah, I also wanted to, there's a lot of January
babies.

160
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,680
Yes, because July 4th, guys.

161
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:23,720
A lot of them, a lot of, a lot of their parents had a great,
uh, independence day.

162
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,560
Wait, what's the new?

163
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,540
Sorry, that's six months.

164
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,560
Wait, what, how many, how many, it's Halloween?

165
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,200
Did they have a good Halloween?

166
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:41,120
Wait, celebrating with, sorry, that's, that's, um, uh, six
months, sorry.

167
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,440
Um, I need, I can't count back.

168
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,360
Which month is it?

169
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,920
July is, okay, wait, which, that, which month is it?

170
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,980
Even less, yeah.

171
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,160
Oh, Easter, that's right.

172
00:16:51,800 --> 00:17:03,100
In the name of, they had they had oh it's either or I mean
it was a late baby then spring break or April oh maybe April

173
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:13,060
fools you're pregnant April fools you're gonna be a dad whoa
you're like oh that's really funny it's like no it's for

174
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:23,500
real you're gonna be a dad please understand I'm sick guys
please understand I'm sick right now what else that was oh

175
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:35,260
yes uh and i think the funniest about the self-park collab
um is that is that tally is also in the game right now like

176
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:52,010
but like the but i i you know how like fortnite is still
like a kids game the fact that tally you know the guy that

177
00:17:52,010 --> 00:18:07,370
does all sorts of of drugs and it's always high 24 7 it's
now it's now a sidekick uh so yeah the the the drugged up

178
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:20,070
towel is now a item in fortnite and also i the i for me the
funniest is this um is the cred backpack because i i'm

179
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:28,690
pretty sure ksi and jake i was a was a logan paul have been
trying to get like cosmetic, like Prime in Fortnite for a

180
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,550
long time.

181
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:42,390
And in the fact that CRED, the parody of Prime is, it's a
real, it's going to be a real item in Fortnite over Prime.

182
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:51,050
So I thought that was fucking hilarious because it's like,
oh my God, guys, we're finally going to get CRED, guys.

183
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,830
It's finally going to happen.

184
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:56,950
I can get cred.

185
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,990
Yeah, we can get cred, guys.

186
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,690
He's all about cred now.

187
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,430
Yeah, give me the cred.

188
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:10,170
So I like that, which means I feel like that means that
we're never going to get Prime in Fortnite.

189
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:10,730
Thank God.

190
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:14,350
Because like, I feel like Prime isn't even a thing anymore,
to be fair.

191
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:16,790
Like, I think the kids have moved on from Prime.

192
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,590
It's all about the six sevens now.

193
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,130
So I never even tried Prime.

194
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:21,770
I'm pretty sure.

195
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,770
I'm pretty sure it's like just a lot of fucking sugar.

196
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:25,810
and everything.

197
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,410
Yeah, I think like all the children have moved on from Prime
now.

198
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:34,590
Another very important announcement that I wanted to make,
that I couldn't make yesterday.

199
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:38,670
That's unrelated to Fortnite, which is an actual real
announcement.

200
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,310
I know I baited you guys with the Fortnite run.

201
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,950
Now I'm giving you guys a real announcement.

202
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:46,170
But I wanted to announce this yesterday as well.

203
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:50,190
But like I said, I was six, so I couldn't, you know, I
couldn't really stream yesterday.

204
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:54,050
But finally, Minecraft has a new update!

205
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:55,130
Oh my God!

206
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:07,570
So Minecraft, this just did, I'm like a fucking news VTuber
now too, like giving you all the hip, I'm literally BuzzFeed

207
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:08,350
the VTuber.

208
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:17,530
You wouldn't believe what they added in Minecraft, and it's
like a slideshow of all the baby Minecraft animals.

209
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:22,070
Hey, at least I didn't give you a slideshow, guys.

210
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,890
I didn't give you the slideshow.

211
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:27,530
I'm giving you the entire image right now.

212
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:36,990
um yeah i'm buzzbird um i'm your newest i'm your newest news
i'm your news source for all the all the trending topics um

213
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:46,410
you would not believe your eyes at what minecraft just added
yesterday um so minecraft did a huge update yesterday uh

214
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:59,390
where basically all the baby uh uh minecraft pets or animals
have like all that are now actual babies but say this might

215
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:13,110
be this might be like a controversial take i do not like the
sheep cow or pig baby baby minecraft uh change because i i

216
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:21,210
really i think those three were a downgrade for me
personally because i really like the giant ass heads i think

217
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:28,890
it's so fucking silly and i really like the the giant heads
that they have um but like the others it's because the cat

218
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:35,450
and the okay the cats have like giant heads so like that
makes sense like you know so i was like wondering why the

219
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:43,270
pigs or the the cows or the sheep have big ass heads i just
think that i just think that it was because like they're

220
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:48,070
like oh we want to make them look more like babies but the
cows look just like they just look like miniature cows they

221
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:53,670
don't look like baby cows to me the new cows literally just
cows.

222
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,250
They don't look like the baby cows.

223
00:21:56,370 --> 00:22:02,030
The others look like babies, but the pigs and the cows don't
look like baby cows or pigs.

224
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:15,830
also, I love the chicken update for, uh, yeah, they just
look like short cows, like really tiny miniature, like

225
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,730
miniature pigs, you know, which are not real.

226
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,670
Apparently, by the way, miniature pigs aren't real.

227
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:24,410
I know, teacup pigs I think they're called teacup pigs.

228
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:29,690
It was a lie created by TikTok influencers.

229
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:37,130
Because, like, basically, whenever they get bigger, they
just, I guess they, like, just throw them away.

230
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:40,670
They just adopt a pig away and then just get a new baby pig.

231
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:44,050
Because teacup pigs are literally just regular pigs.

232
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:52,790
So they're not, they're like, look at my tiny teacup pig
that I got.

233
00:22:53,090 --> 00:23:02,550
But they were just regular pigs that they just bought and
lied to us about how they were tiny, tiny pet-sized pigs.

234
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:07,050
Anyway, but yeah, no, the cows just look like miniature
cows, but is they real?

235
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:17,510
Anyway, so what I love about the new Minecraft update is the
things people were doing with the chickens.

236
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:22,950
Because they, okay, it was like all over my Twitter feed.

237
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:26,090
I think it was the Japanese minecrafters.

238
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,590
They're wild.

239
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:37,150
But basically, a Japanese minecrafter made a popcorn machine
with the baby chicken.

240
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,510
They're like, popcorn.

241
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:46,310
It's so fucking good.

242
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:49,670
And then, okay, the really messed up one.

243
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:54,870
I will say, there was a really messed up one.

244
00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:12,750
right after popcorn and it was that a Japanese minecrafter
recreated the chicken factory with the chicks so he made a

245
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:24,670
sorting machine being like if it's a male chick we sort him
into the lava pen if it's a female chick we put him into the

246
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:41,480
pen and i'm like oh my god i was just like from popcorn to
like chicken factory that's abs that's like insane it's the

247
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:48,620
circle of life it's like whoa steve got a job at the chicken
factory

248
00:24:54,020 --> 00:25:03,340
someone's gotta monitor this man like that is like the first
idea you had um when with the new update someone's gotta

249
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:16,060
monitor him i i'm scared anyway is that all the updates i
want to tell you guys today all the announcements but i

250
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:25,460
swear to god god of war is so fucking cursed every time
something happens when i want to stream god of war something

251
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:33,860
fucking happens to me it's like it's a pattern at this point
like once or twice it's like a coincidence three four five,

252
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,260
six, there's something going on with God of War.

253
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:42,280
There's something like someone out there does not want me to
stream God of War.

254
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:48,660
Anyway, like I said, even though I'm sick, I still want to
stream today because I felt like I said, like we're just

255
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:55,180
doing BuzzFeed quizzes and like BuzzFeed quizzes, you know,
like they don't put a lot of effort making these quizzes.

256
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,920
So I don't need to put a lot of effort answering the quiz.

257
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:06,040
I don't need to use a lot of my brain power to really answer
chilling it's like it's like the lockdown came back again

258
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:14,100
everyone's just fucking um answering random ass bus v
quizzes just past the time that's literally what it is right

259
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:24,160
now um so we're gonna be chilling um for those who never
experience bus v quizzes it is a an experience so i have no

260
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:34,960

261
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,020
like, I don't know, Swifties.

262
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,960
Captain Apeball, they give a super chat.

263
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,220
Thank you, thank you.

264
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,220
I know you're not streamed to them.

265
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,660
I just want you to know that you were my, were.

266
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,800
Wait, what happened to me?

267
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,720
What's going to happen to me?

268
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,160
But thank you for the super chat.

269
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,360
Thank you, thank you.

270
00:26:54,300 --> 00:27:03,020
So for those who never grew up with BuzzFeed quizzes,
BuzzFeed used to be incredibly popular back in the day.

271
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:10,700
um not just for quizzes but like did you know uh I have but
they did college college dropout right was was no not

272
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:19,060
BuzzFeed um BuzzFeed unsolved like mysteries and stuff like
that um BuzzFeed came from BuzzFeed because like you guys

273
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:30,140
like you know it's BuzzFeed and BuzzFeed had a lot of um a
lot of like fun activities back then uh yeah dropout is

274
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:34,700
college humor I was like I uh I always BuzzFeed sometime.

275
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,640
And you will be remembered.

276
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,080
Try guys.

277
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:49,140
Yeah, the try guys before the guy cheated on his wife used
to be from BuzzFeed as well.

278
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:56,240
They had a lot of really good YouTube channels, as well as
comics back then and animated series before they got like

279
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,260
way too big.

280
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:05,740
I think that's way too MCM-like, and then they got too big
to cut.

281
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,040
It's like the Roman Empire.

282
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,500
I know, I always think about the Roman Empire.

283
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:17,920
You know, like they conquered everything, and then they
conquered like so many land, but it got too big that all the

284
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,300
land started falling apart.

285
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,620
So it's literally, the BuzzFeed was like the Roman Empire.

286
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:29,240
They tried to pursue endless growth, and then everything
just came crashing down in the end because it was just too

287
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,080
many people, too many BuzzFeed channels.

288
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:41,060
uh to not really no it's true they had the thing is they had
a lot of like million like million plus subscriber channels

289
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:51,340
um and um and they had like a lot of like animation shorts
animations to channels too and i used to watch this and like

290
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:57,200
animation channel from buzzfeed the creator left uh because
the creator from for one of them was like one of my favorite

291
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:04,280
artists um and uh or like to Roman BuzzFeed.

292
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:10,000
Yeah, and they want to both serve for journalism too.

293
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:18,800
And yeah, so they had a lot, but then it ended up crashing
down, but at least we still have their BuzzFeed quizzes.

294
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:24,320
Their BuzzFeed quizzes were notorious for being so fucking
random.

295
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,740
Like, I will show you what I mean.

296
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:32,120
I can tell when you meet your soulmate based on the rom-com

apparently their chicken is really good um and the only

330
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:25,440
place i've actually ever been to any of these was dunkin

00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,160
Dunkin' Donuts is mid in NA.

333
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,240
I will say that.

334
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:40,820
I'll do Chick-fil-A just because, like, everyone says
Chick-fil-A is really good.

335
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,400
So I'll go with Chick-fil-A.

336
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,940
I've never been to Chick-fil-A, but I'll go with
Chick-fil-A.

337
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:53,120
Which of these TV shows appeal to you the most?

338
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,460
Army Wives, Drew Carey, Breaking Bad Community.

339
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:58,780
Oh, shit.

340
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,740
Okay, I've actually been re-watching Community.

341
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,920
I think community writing is so good.

342
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:14,280
I will, like, I think, like, okay, the only issue is, like,
overall, though, community, season one to three are very

343
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,680
strong, and then after that, it's not so good.

344
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:22,060
Parks and Rec, season one fucking sucked, but after season
one, it's all good.

345
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:30,720
The office, it's good overall, but, like, I laughed more
watching community than I did.

346
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:37,780
like either Parks and Recs or the office because community
had like shock humor and I fucking love shock humor.

347
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:48,100
You can't be putting thought into this if you want the
genuine BuzzFeed experience.

348
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,780
I'm sorry, I'm sick right now.

349
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,800
So like my mind ain't going doing so well.

350
00:33:55,580 --> 00:34:03,460
I think I'm going to say community because the writing, I
lack more in community Season 1 and 3 were so strong, and

351
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:11,120
it's, I laughed more in community than I ever did on Office
or Parks and Recs, so I'm gonna go with community.

352
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,920
Choose a baby, okay.

353
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:20,080
Okay, who, who, guys, which, okay, I like this baby.

354
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:23,180
Wait, but then it's Vincent Adult Man.

355
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:26,900
Okay, wait, this baby looks like he can pay my rent.

356
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,160
I'm gonna choose this baby.

357
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,760
Which animal do you...

358
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,280
Yeah, it's a boss, guys.

359
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:35,480
It's...

360
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,780
He looks like the boss.

361
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,300
Which animal do you feel best represents you?

362
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:43,600
Alright.

363
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,300
Okay, I mean, obviously...

364
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,420
Okay, there's a chicken.

365
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,420
And then there's a robin.

366
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:52,060
Oh my god, I forgot to tell you guys the story.

367
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,080
I was at a park.

368
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,060
I was, like, at a park that was, like, sort of, like, not
just a park part.

369
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,380
But, like, it's sort of, like, in the woods type deal.

370
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:09,520
a hawk started circling dad and I freaked the fuck out
because I was like, oh my, it's trying to kidnap my dog.

371
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,380
And it was literally, like, I saw the shadow of a hawk,
like, in like the shadow of it flying past.

372
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,500
And I was like, oh, it's a, that's a big ass bird.

373
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,020
And then it came back.

374
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,960
It came back and I was like, wait a minute.

375
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,740
And it started like circling him.

376
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:34,060
And I was like, oh my god and i like ran i was like come dad
get over here i don't you're gonna get fucking kidnapped

377
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:41,740
yeah that actually wasn't fucking i've never had that fear
before but now i have a new fear this is why i stay in the

378
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:53,040
city guys this is exactly why i stay in the city uh yeah i
was just like i was just like oh I googled it.

379
00:35:53,120 --> 00:36:03,140
I was like kid hawks kidnap my dog and they're like Usually
a hawk wouldn't be able to carry Carry dog like dogs because

380
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:09,520
like they they usually hunt for like squirrels and stuff I
guess he thought my he thought my dog was a giant ass

381
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:15,560
squirrel But like at best it would just like they would try
to carry him But they might not be able to pick him up

382
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:23,740
because he's like 10 plus pounds I think they just thought
he was a fucking giant rat um or a giant squirrel because it

383
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:33,700
wasn't like a giant hawk it was like it was like a medium
size wait they can okay maybe i i don't want to test it you

384
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:39,900
he is like 15 plus pounds so like i was i'm just thinking
they're like usually they can't carry 10 plus pounds like oh

385
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:51,540
my god but thank god thank god you're thick dad thank
fucking god yeah but it's a talent so that like freaked me

386
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:57,480

was actually about to get kidnapped and then i ran out there

387
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:04,220
it's like get away and he's safe now this is why i was like
i'm trying to a new dog park because i was like oh it's like

388
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:12,400
sort of in the woods and stuff so it's like more naturey and

391
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,280
They give him the super chat.

392
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:29,800
They can think.

393
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,260
And he wasn't aware.

394
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,960
The thing is, he didn't even know it was happening.

395
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:42,220
He was like mid, the fucking scariest part was that when the
hawk was circling him, he was mid poop.

396
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:47,640
So, so he's just, it was giving me eye contact too.

397
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:52,280
I don't know if your dog does that, but do your dogs, do
your, oh yeah, There's no BGM.

398
00:37:52,440 --> 00:38:01,100
I forgot I put DGM, but your dogs look give you eye contact
when they poop because my dog does that He was giving me eye

399
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:12,140
contact while a hawk was circling him and I was like, oh my
god, bro like please, please for the love of God All right,

00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,300
Yeah, his guard was down.

402
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,440
He was, how dare he try to hunt him when he's pooping.

403
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,800
I heard, I read about that.

404
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:38,720
Like, if a cat if a cat like poops in front of you, was it
cats?

405
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:45,100
I think it was like, if a cat poops or pees in front of you,
he trusts you to like, he trusts you because you're like,

406
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,600
you know, it's like his most vulnerable state.

407
00:38:47,900 --> 00:39:01,720
So if they're willing to do it in front of you, that means
he fucking you to not hurt him little fun fact anyway oh

There's no...

432
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:19,950
There's still plenty of year left, Toki.

433
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:24,610
We still have the rest of 2026 left before you get there.

434
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:27,270
Wait, is it distracted?

435
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:28,030
Distracted.

436
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:29,510
Yeah, I didn't even see that.

437
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,290

00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:33,350
I didn't even see distracted.

440
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:37,130
Pick a musician.

00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:39,670
That's Elvis.

442
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:43,070
Oh, that's the girl that sang Valerie.

444
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,250
Oh, that's Bob Marley.

445
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:50,850
I don't know half of these.

446
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:54,630
The only one I recognize is Elvis personally.

447
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:57,430
I don't know who these other people are.

448
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:58,450
I'm sorry.

449
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:04,670
I know their voice is, but like, I'll pick Elvis Presley
because I know who Elvis is.

450
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:07,470
Which of these names will you choose for your baby?

451
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:09,530
Alexander?

452
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:12,150
That's such an old man's name.

453
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:13,550
I'm sorry to all the Alexander's.

454
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:19,570
I mean, like, Alex seems fine, but Alexander seems like such
an old man name.

455
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:21,590
Okay, same with Abigail.

456
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:23,130

457
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:26,430
Is that not Bob Marley?

458
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:27,390
Who's this guy?

459
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:42,350
I feel like Michael is like the safest name out there.

460
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:45,390
Which of these is your favorite movie quote?

461
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,110
Oh, who's Jimmy Hendrix?

462
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:52,110
Sorry, I don't know who Jimmy Hendrix is.

463
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:58,410
I don't know who Jimmy Hendrix is, guys.

464
00:41:58,690 --> 00:41:59,310
I'm sorry.

465
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:01,850
Which of these is your favorite movie quotes?

466
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:06,810
I'm, uh, I guess I'm just not that old.

467
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:21,910
I told you guys, all the music I discovered, because, like,
I was so not, like, I was so sheltered that I don't know,

468
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:29,390
like, a lot of music back then, because all I did was just
listen to, um, shut up.

469
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:37,110
I all I did was just listen to Disney songs and then when
people ask me what my favorite song is I didn't want people

470
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:41,450
to think I was a kid so I'll be like Britney Spears and
they'll be like what song from Britney Spears do you like

471
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:46,090
and I'll be like oh I like all of them but I've never
listened to Britney Spears I just know she was super popular

472
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:52,790
back then and then later on Glee came out and that's when I
discovered other types of music existed other than Disney

473
00:42:52,790 --> 00:43:00,690
and I just like, oh, that's Amy.

474
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:01,590
Oh, Amy Winehouse.

475
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:02,370
Oh, not Amy Winehouse.

476
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:04,430
No, that's, no, not Amy Winehouse.

477
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:06,750
Um, Amy Winehouse is, sorry, that's not her.

478
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:10,430
Um, that's, I was like, oh, Amy Winehouse sang Valerie.

479
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:12,390
I don't know who she is.

480
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:15,190
I just realized I actually don't know who this person is.

481
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:22,020
Uh, so what do you listen to now?

482
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,120
Um, Nintendo Coffee Shop Instrumentals.

483
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,780
That's what I'm working.

484
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:32,460
What I listen to now.

485
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,240
I just don't have time to listen to music.

486
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:38,420
Because I'm always working.

487
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:47,510
The full circle.

488
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:49,130
Like the...

489
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:51,950
I don't like listen to music.

490
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:54,470
I don't like to listen to music when there's lyrics playing.

491
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:56,750
Just because I can't focus at all.

492
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:00,410
Because like when I'm typing messages and stuff.

493
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:01,250
It's like...

494
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:02,370
When I'm typing messages.

495
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:05,390
and I'm listening to music with lyrics in there.

496
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:09,790
Like, my head would focus on the lyrics and I just fuck up
whatever I'm typing.

497
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:11,750
That's why I just listen to instrumental.

498
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:23,050
I'm firmly believing the philosopher rule in class,
especially since I rule.

499
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:24,190
I like that.

500
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:25,910
Oh, man.

501
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:27,830
How do you get the beans above the Frank?

502
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:30,990
I gave Jesus a chance, but it just didn't work out between
us.

503
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:33,150
We are the titans, the mighty, mighty titans.

504
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:44,950
there's no goonies never say that gooners never say that i

Okay, actually.

508
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:09,530
Gooners never die.

509
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:10,870
Never say die.

510
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:15,470
That's a fucking crazy lie.

511
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:17,550
Yeah, I was like, what?

512
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:19,270
Choose an actor.

513
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:22,570
I don't.

514
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:25,050
Oh, okay, bitch.

515
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:27,070
Um.

516
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:29,850
I, okay.

517
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:32,770
I don't know.

518
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:35,990
I will say I was actually going through men in black
nostalgia.

519
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:37,330
recently.

520
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:42,710
It's hard.

521
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:48,210
I was going through men in black nostalgia, like, literally,
like, an hour ago, too.

522
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:50,270
But, like, I don't know.

523
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:55,850
I was going to say either Aaron Paul or is Ellen an actor?

524
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:57,230
Yes, she played Dory.

525
00:45:57,710 --> 00:46:00,590
She was literally Dory in Finding Mimo.

526
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:08,770
I look, I know a lot of people forgot about it, but, like,
she, she, before she was a talk show host um she was

527
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:20,210
actually a very well-known actress and she was also dorian
finding memo yeah she had her own tv show before then and

528
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:29,230
now she lives in the uk i guess like uh because she got
exposed her being not a very nice lady

529
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:38,700
oh my god i'm gonna say will smith just because i was going
through i was watching men and Black clips recently, like

530
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:39,900
literally an hour ago.

531
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:45,380
I want to do a watch along for Men in Black because I never
watched the third movie and I want to do like a marathon for

532
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:46,060
memory stream.

533
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,100
Um, I really want to do a watch a lot of Men in Black
because I fucking love Men in Black and I, but I got like

534
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:59,320
super nostalgic over like, I wish they, I wish like, okay,
you guys would be like, but they did rebuke the snow.

535
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:05,340
We do not count the fucking Chris Hemmsworth version of Men
in Black International, whatever the fuck that was.

536
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:12,780
I didn't watch Men in Black for them, but like i heard it
was really fucking bad and i i denounced it as part of the

537
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:21,820
men in black franchise it does not count um but uh i love
men in black and i really i miss i really love the animated

538
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:28,220
shows too i used to watch that shit all the time we need men
in black for like actual men in black for it yeah they made

539
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:35,120
a men in black for and it was like called men in black
international but it's not it started like none of the none

540
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,800
of the actual none of the actors from Men in Black.

541
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:40,160
Other than the Pug, apparently.

542
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:42,060
The Pug King back.

543
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:45,660

Yeah, there's a Men in Black animation.

00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,640

555
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,640
The hawk can't hurt you anymore.

556
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,880
The least amount of grass please.

00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,100

00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:14,880
places.

564
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,360
One of the Windows background.

The OG Windows background.

00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:29,300
Also, I don't know what it looks like when I press the last
one, so I'm just going to double check.

00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:32,540

Thank you.

585
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,620
Well, that's me, Toronto, right?

586
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:35,500
Toronto seems like a lot, or was it, I don't, I don't, never
hear anything about Ottawa, but I know Ottawa is important.

587
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:36,900
I'm going to say Ottawa.

588
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:38,420
Oh, I'm correct.

589
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:39,620
Yes, I fucking knew.

590
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:40,400
Okay, yeah.

591
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:42,620
Yeah, I know Toronto is, like, the biggest city.

592
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:44,440
But I always hear a lot about Ottawa.

593
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,360
But I'm like, what the fuck does Ottawa give us?

594
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:48,340
And then Ottawa is where the capital city is.

595
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,720
Although Toronto is Canada's biggest city.

596
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:58,820
Ottawa is the country's capital and home of Ireland.

597
00:51:58,920 --> 00:51:59,800
Yeah, there you go.

598
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:02,220
Here you go.

599
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:05,540
What is Canada's tallest structure?

600
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,140
Oh, that's...

601
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:08,880
What the fuck?

602
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:11,420
Why would I need to know this as a fucking Canadian?

603
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:13,380
We don't fucking care what's tall.

604
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:15,020
The CN Tower?

605
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:15,700
Yeah!

606
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:24,100
At 553 meters, the CN Tower surpasses all of the structures
in Canada.

607
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:28,340
Who was Canada's first... Okay, I definitely know it's not
Stephen...

608
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:30,040
Oh, John Ab... Okay, it's John A.

609
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:30,540
McDonald.

610
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,140
Who the fuck is John Ab?

611
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:34,820
Okay, there's three Johns.

612
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:37,460
John's as Prime Minister.

613
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,480
I can't keep track of all of them.

614
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:45,200
You know, deep down in your heart, I'm actually from
Colorado.

615
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,440
Don't keep, please.

616
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:55,640
Look, we had lots, I know it's not Stephen Harper, because
that's the guy from before Trudeau.

617
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:00,440
That's crazy that Justin Trudeau is now dating Katie Perry,
by the way.

618
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:09,980
Bro, okay, someone, I saw a tweet that was like, has the
most generational run ever and it's like because like before

619
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:19,020
he was our prime minister um he the very first job he did

00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:46,480
What a fucking resume.

624
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:53,660
Oh yeah, and his favorite party trick, his favorite party
trick is that he would pretend he would fall down the stairs

625
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:54,620
and be okay.

626
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:58,780
Literally, there's an interview of him being like, what's
the favorite party trick that you would like to do?

627
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:04,380
And then he was like, oh, I love falling down the stairs and
making people freak out, and then, but I'll be fine.

628
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:15,360
And then, um, And then like, and also he did like a, before
he became Prime Minister, he did a, he did like a strip

630
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,520
I think he was like still part of the party back then, but
it's like, oh, it's charity.

631
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:24,500
Why don't you strip for, there's videos of it.

00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:28,580
And then there's videos of it.

633

And he literally like fucking danced on a pose and started
stripping for charity and a political, in a political.

Thank you, thank you.

642
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,520

643
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:27,800
Alright.

644
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,160

00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,220
Okay, a maple leaf.

646
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,100
I know that.

647
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,180
Congrats, it's the maple leaf.

648
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:35,720
Yay!

649
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:38,000
I can't have it.

650
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:41,540
The fact that he became Katie Perry's boyfriend too.

651
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:44,420
Right after he stopped being the Prime Minister.

652
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,680
He was like, what should I do next?

653
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,880
Divorce my wife and start dating Katie Perry.

654
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:53,740
That's insane.

655
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,640
Wording greeners of poutine.

656
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:00,400
All right, fries, gravy, and cheese curds.

657
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:01,620
We all know that.

658
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:07,400
Gamers God, again, he's just doing fucking side quest.

659
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:07,740
Oh, yeah.

660
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:08,780
Oh, she divorced.

661
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:09,200
Oh, yeah.

662
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:10,100
She divorced.

663
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,680
I didn't keep track on who divorced who.

664
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:13,480
I just know, like, I was like, what the fuck?

665
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:14,720
Like, they got divorced?

666
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:16,700
Um, okay.

667
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,200
That, I know.

668
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,180
I love Poutine.

669
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:24,800
Uh, Poutine is so fucking good.

670
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,360
What is this body?

671
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:26,700
What?

672
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,780
Oh, it's Hudson's Bay.

673
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:32,100
Yeah, that's the only, that's the only pool of water I know
in Canada.

674
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:37,700
I'm like, what the fuck is Moose Coast and McKenzie Trail.

675
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,140
I was like, Ontario has a fucking lake.

676
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:40,800
Bro, I don't know.

677
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,500
They don't fucking live in Ontario.

678
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:45,420
I know what Hudson Bay is.

679
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:49,420
Oh, because, yeah, I know what Hudson Bay is because I know
the department store.

680
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:50,720
That's why.

681
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:53,160
I was like, I didn't even know it was water.

682
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,400
I thought it was a department store.

683
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,720
I have, but we can't because it's got to be marketed.

684
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:04,900
Wait, kids, protein marketed as an exotic dish.

685
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:05,780
That's crazy.

686
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:09,300
It's literally fries, cheesecruits, and gravy.

687
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,700
And America fucking loves gravy.

688
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:14,380
What's on the Canadian dollar coin?

689
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:15,220
Oh, it's a loon.

690
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:17,140
That's right.

691
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,760
Our coins are animals.

692
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:25,800
That's why I always, it's funny when I tell people, it's
loonies and tunies.

693
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:30,520
People think I'm like making shit up when I'm like, oh,
yeah, the dollar is called loony.

694
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:33,660
And the two dollar coin is called tunie because it's two.

695
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,940
It's not because there's two birds.

696
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:37,980
It's just because it just sounds cuter.

697
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:39,920
Yeah, loonies and tunies.

698
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,400
That's why we call it loony.

699
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,120
The tunie has a polar bear.

700
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:45,660
It has nothing to do with a bird.

701
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:49,720
You could trace the card.

702
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:53,120
This isn't a real...

703
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:53,700
Yeah, see?

704
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:54,880
It's a loony.

705
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:56,560
There it is.

706
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:57,380
Our $2.

707
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,900
Our $2 coin has a polar bear.

708
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:01,460
Our $0.05...

709
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:02,340
Okay, 5...

710
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:03,260
Okay, it's crazy.

711
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:05,280
Our $0.05 is a beaver.

712
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:05,940
Our $0.20.

713
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:18,060
25 cents is a moose um and our and our 10 cents is a fucking
boat i don't know why like i don't know why why like we had

714
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:29,120
a good pattern going on we were like we were like fever
moose loon um um polar bear and then we ran out of animals i

715
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:31,320

00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:36,320

Well, the Canadian animals we have.

719
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:41,440
And we're like, I don't know, put a fucking boat on it.

720
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,900
Yeah, my favorite animal, a fucking boat.

721
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:48,700
The apex ready of the ocean.

722
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:49,840
The boat.

723
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:50,840
Exactly.

724
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:56,480
It's what the bullet band left behind.

725
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:57,600
The first animal.

726
00:58:58,280 --> 00:58:59,580
A John ass boat.

728
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:16,680

american airline because it was like the only airline that

794
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:53,340
Life of Pi is written by a Canadian?

795
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:56,400

796
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,880
Oh, based off of Jan Martel.

797
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:01,260
He was born in Spain.

798
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:02,620
Oh, it's a Canadian author, okay?

01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:05,360

01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:10,300
Yeah, okay.

802
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,600
He moved to Canada.

803
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:25,070
use canadian though that's crazy also i'm surprised the
handmaid's tale is is written by a canadian isn't that the

804
01:05:25,070 --> 01:05:33,910
one where it's based in america where like women don't have
rights and then they flee to canada no yeah i was just gonna

805
01:05:33,910 --> 01:05:42,310
say i was like i was like thinking like like the whole
premise is that like like america turned into this fucking

806
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:52,990
country where like like women are of all rights but it was
only in america like it's only it's only in america where

807
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:59,850
all of this happens so the rest of the countries are like
are like okay they're all just like watching the what the

808
01:05:59,850 --> 01:06:08,990
fuck is going on in the states right now and because like
it's just all in fucking america and then like because like

809
01:06:08,990 --> 01:06:14,970
in canada everything is normal and then the whole thing is
that I never watched it had me, so I did read a summary of

810
01:06:14,970 --> 01:06:15,110
it.

811
01:06:15,170 --> 01:06:18,210
Like, I read, like, summary of some of the episodes and
stuff.

812
01:06:18,810 --> 01:06:20,210
And I've seen parodies of it.

813
01:06:21,650 --> 01:06:28,730
And then, like, and then, like, to, like, free themselves,
like, the women, like, did, like, broke out.

814
01:06:28,790 --> 01:06:29,510
It's, like, prison break.

815
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:30,990
But, like, the prison is America.

816
01:06:31,370 --> 01:06:33,430
And then, like, they fucking ran in Canada.

817
01:06:33,570 --> 01:06:35,170
And it's all fucking fine over there.

818
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:40,490
I don't swear, yeah, I read the Spartan.

819
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:42,450
So, I'm very surprised.

820
01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:48,530
surprised that I thought this was written by an American
that's pretty funny I did not realize handmade so was

821
01:06:48,530 --> 01:06:57,270
written by Canadian yeah because it because I remember that
people were like really mad about hands-made tales because I

822
01:06:57,270 --> 01:07:02,910
read about it people were like oh wasn't because when the
show first came out everyone everyone was like talking about

823
01:07:02,910 --> 01:07:08,130
it and everything and they're all like oh my god it's such a
good like when the show first came out everyone was like

824
01:07:08,130 --> 01:07:13,430
talking about how like interesting it was and everything and
then I was like and then I realized I think kept making more

825
01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:21,110
seasons about it and i was like bro what the fuck why
because like the women escaped america and then like went to

826
01:07:21,110 --> 01:07:26,750
canada so i was like why would they need more seasons and
apparently she went back to america to start like a

827
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:33,210
revolution it's like prison it really basically was like
prison break where they broke out of prison but they had to

828
01:07:33,210 --> 01:07:42,450
keep going because people love the show so they went back to
prison yeah and then they went back to prison to do what

829
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:43,630
Another prison break.

830
01:07:43,990 --> 01:07:45,210
It's literally like that.

831
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:51,060
That was really funny.

832
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:54,160
Yeah, like in Lost.

833
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:55,100
Yeah, exactly.

834
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:57,420
Like, they're lost, but then they're not lost anymore.

835
01:07:57,540 --> 01:08:00,240
So they go back to the island to be lost again.

836
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:03,960
Yeah, they're like, let's run it back.

837
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:04,900
What's your...

838
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:05,920
Oh, Terry Fox.

839
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:06,760
I know him.

840
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:09,740
Everyone always talks about him.

841
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:13,220
Basically, he's a famous run.

842
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:14,820
He's like a...

843
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:18,260
This guy had cancer, and that's why his leg is amputated.

844
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:23,500
So he's amputated, and then all he does, like, marathon runs
to raise money for cancer.

845
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:27,520
Yeah, the Terry Fox run is very famous.

846
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:30,700

These are all shitty toppings.

979
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:04,880
Mine has a curse of pineapple for it to be a pineapple.

980
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:08,040
But okay, I'd rather be pineapple than mushroom.

Orange chicken isn't even like Chinese.

997
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:34,540
Like, it's not even a Chinese dish.

998
01:17:34,620 --> 01:17:36,380
It was invented by Americans.

999
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:37,100

01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:49,240
The French option.

1008
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:55,360
The cigarette tab.

1009
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:58,520
I want to say, I'm going to say macaron.

1010
01:18:58,980 --> 01:18:59,780
I love macaron.

1011
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:00,400
What am I?

1012
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:01,660
I'm a hamster.

1013
01:19:02,380 --> 01:19:05,220
Yes, Lottie's not a fucking raccoon.

1014
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:06,380
I'm fine with that.

1015
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:08,960
You're a hamster.

1016
01:19:10,460 --> 01:19:13,700
and sometimes don't realize how much you love to hide and
dig around.

1017
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:19,000
I like to hide in my own shit, I guess.

1018
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:20,520
Like that sounds.

1019
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:21,080
Yay.

1020
01:19:23,660 --> 01:19:24,180
Raptaro.

1021
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:26,360
Na na na na na.

1022
01:19:32,490 --> 01:19:33,510
Na na.

1023
01:19:34,890 --> 01:19:35,150
Na.

1024
01:19:42,510 --> 01:19:43,350
What's the Ham-Taro?

1025
01:19:43,370 --> 01:19:44,890
That's the Ham-Taro ending theme, right?

1026
01:19:44,990 --> 01:19:45,610
The English one.

1027
01:19:45,750 --> 01:19:46,650
I gotta pull it up.

1028
01:19:47,210 --> 01:19:47,870
Now I'm curious.

1029
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:49,650
Ham-Taro ending theme.

1030
01:19:52,670 --> 01:19:55,890
I love the English themes of Ham-Taro, too.

1031
01:19:56,190 --> 01:19:58,570
Ham-Taro English opening.

1032
01:19:58,990 --> 01:20:00,450
Is that the opening or the ending?

1033
01:20:02,590 --> 01:20:04,210
No, that has to be the ending.

1034
01:20:05,790 --> 01:20:06,090
Row.

1035
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:09,610
And a- Bada-Bada-Bada-A-Ham-Taro.

1036
01:20:12,510 --> 01:20:14,170
What is it?

1037
01:20:16,970 --> 01:20:17,990
Let's go!

1038
01:20:18,130 --> 01:20:20,310
Yeah, it is!

1039
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:23,350
Let's go!

1040
01:20:24,450 --> 01:20:24,950
Here you go.

1041
01:20:25,650 --> 01:20:26,710
The ending slapped too.

1042
01:20:26,770 --> 01:20:29,050
I like the Hamtaro ending, the English one.

1043
01:20:30,130 --> 01:20:30,970
It's a little quiet though.

1044
01:20:32,090 --> 01:20:35,190
Bro, the drummer was going at it.

1045
01:20:35,390 --> 01:20:36,410
Yeah, yeah.

1046
01:20:36,950 --> 01:20:37,210
Yeah.

1047
01:20:37,810 --> 01:20:38,410
Yeah.

1048
01:20:39,310 --> 01:20:39,310
Yeah.

1049
01:20:39,830 --> 01:20:39,830

which one okay sorry Let's see.

1052
01:21:13,030 --> 01:21:16,490
All right, let's see what five nights of Freddy's
animatronic I am.

1053
01:21:16,970 --> 01:21:18,250
All right, we're done.

1054
01:21:18,430 --> 01:21:23,430
It's time to find out which five nights of Freddy's
animatronic you're most likely based on how you play the

1055
01:21:23,430 --> 01:21:23,810
game.

1056
01:21:24,270 --> 01:21:27,290
Where are you most likely to hide in the FNAF 1 restaurant?

1057
01:21:27,830 --> 01:21:32,350
Um, I'll hide in the bathroom because everyone thinks you're
always safe in the bathroom.

1058
01:21:32,770 --> 01:21:33,690
So I'll hide in there.

1059
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:36,270
So I'll get them when they're most vulnerable.

1060
01:21:37,530 --> 01:21:41,350
Just like how the hawk was trying to kill my, like get that
my dog.

1061
01:21:42,890 --> 01:21:45,470
Which strange addiction do you have?

1062
01:21:46,610 --> 01:21:48,370
Uh, social distancing.

1063
01:21:49,910 --> 01:21:50,750
That's okay.

1064
01:21:51,190 --> 01:21:51,750
Alright.

1065
01:21:54,990 --> 01:21:55,870
You get it, God.

1066
01:21:56,190 --> 01:21:57,030
You get it, yeah.

1067
01:21:58,270 --> 01:22:00,950
Um, which set of animatronics are your favorites?

1068
01:22:01,830 --> 01:22:03,230
Uh, I think the class.

1069
01:22:03,330 --> 01:22:04,230
I mean, okay.

1070
01:22:04,790 --> 01:22:07,470
I, okay, I'm gonna say the toys, because cheek is hot.

1071
01:22:12,790 --> 01:22:15,770
She gets hotter in the toys version.

1072
01:22:16,530 --> 01:22:18,450
Which game model is your favorite?

1073
01:22:20,710 --> 01:22:22,810
We're talking about the animatronics again?

1074
01:22:24,030 --> 01:22:25,030
I guess like two.

1075
01:22:26,450 --> 01:22:27,750
I feel like the classics.

1076
01:22:30,130 --> 01:22:32,890
Yeah, toy Chica is the best version of Chica.

1077
01:22:33,890 --> 01:22:35,570
Your what-up does?

1078
01:22:35,930 --> 01:22:37,630
Which do you play for that PC?

1079
01:22:38,210 --> 01:22:40,530
You can play on your fucking phone?

1080
01:22:40,670 --> 01:22:41,350
That's crazy.

1081
01:22:42,310 --> 01:22:44,250
Finally, which would you do at Freddy Fazbear?

1082
01:22:44,430 --> 01:22:46,490
Freddy Fazbear's pizzeria.

1083
01:22:49,690 --> 01:22:50,650
Eat pizza.

1084
01:22:51,490 --> 01:22:52,750
It's a pizzeria.

1085
01:22:52,870 --> 01:22:53,810
I'll go eat pizza.

1086
01:22:54,610 --> 01:22:54,630
Alright.

1087
01:22:54,830 --> 01:22:55,710
I'm Freddy!

1088
01:22:56,190 --> 01:22:56,550
Okay.

1089
01:22:57,070 --> 01:22:57,610
Ah, yes.

1090
01:22:57,670 --> 01:22:58,870
Oh, at least I'm the main character.

1091
01:22:59,130 --> 01:22:59,870
That's good.

1092
01:23:00,070 --> 01:23:01,630
I have main character syndrome.

1093
01:23:02,530 --> 01:23:04,210
Yeah, I was like, I'm at a pizzeria.

1094
01:23:04,290 --> 01:23:06,250
What the else would I fucking do?

1095
01:23:06,450 --> 01:23:07,130
Or, or?

1096
01:23:09,550 --> 01:23:10,390
Ah, yes.

1097
01:23:10,470 --> 01:23:11,470
The main man.

1098
01:23:12,370 --> 01:23:12,910
animatronic.

1099
01:23:13,510 --> 01:23:16,330
Freddy is laid back, happy, and easygoing.

1100
01:23:16,590 --> 01:23:20,150
At night, he loves to taunt the night guard, singing a song
before a jump scare.

1101
01:23:20,610 --> 01:23:25,270
He loves interactive children and hang out with bedspuds,
chicken, and Bonnie.

1102
01:23:29,310 --> 01:23:33,190
Yeah, Freddy is laid back, happy, and easygoing.

1103
01:23:33,570 --> 01:23:34,650
He literally kills.

1104
01:23:34,670 --> 01:23:40,010
Yeah, if you're human, if you're human, he'll kill you, but
you're a fellow animatronic.

1105
01:23:40,470 --> 01:23:44,630
Like, The image is no longer available.

1106
01:23:46,370 --> 01:23:48,170
Okay, we won't have to do this one yet.

1107
01:23:49,570 --> 01:23:55,810
Only nerds with an IQ over 175 can pass this fandom vocab
quiz.

1108
01:23:56,170 --> 01:23:57,910
Oh, that is easy.

01:23:58,530 --> 01:23:59,630
That is easy.

1110
01:23:59,790 --> 01:24:01,690
I'm terminally online.

1111
01:24:04,250 --> 01:24:04,590
Okay.

1112
01:24:05,610 --> 01:24:06,830
What is a muggle?

1113
01:24:07,050 --> 01:24:10,330
A person born with no magical abilities.

1114
01:24:11,030 --> 01:24:12,010
Oh, my.

1115
01:24:12,310 --> 01:24:13,290
Easy.

1116
01:24:14,530 --> 01:24:16,010
Define Vibranium.

1117
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,220

01:24:26,900 --> 01:24:29,300
Define Medi-Clorian.

1119
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:31,980

01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:33,540
Define Mockingjay.

1121

Oh, this one.

1128
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:55,760
Yeah, it's genetically engineered bird species that can
mimic human voices and spy on others.

1129
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:56,660
Wait.

1130
01:24:57,980 --> 01:24:58,340

Wait, no.

1132
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:00,900
It was first regenerative through the mating.

Oh, mockingbirds.

1134
01:25:01,940 --> 01:25:02,120

01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:07,580
I remember this.

1141
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,520
I didn't read any of the books.

1142
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:11,820
I just remember I watched the movies recently.

1143
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:14,540
I recently like two or three years ago.

1144
01:25:16,460 --> 01:25:16,740
All right.

1145
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:17,780
Define kryptonite.

1146
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:18,780
Oh, that's easy.

1147
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:22,180
uh yeah

1148
01:25:33,620 --> 01:25:43,860
okay i had to i was like i remember okay i know what
kryptonite is but i was like i didn't realize it emitted

1149
01:25:43,860 --> 01:25:52,140
poisonous radiation because like everyone on krypton isn't
like an actual like superhuman um it's just that because the

1150
01:25:52,140 --> 01:26:01,620
gravity is so like it's because like he gets his powers from
the sun so like um he doesn't and really it's like people on

1151
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:11,560
crypto and aren't really like superpowered beings and stuff
so i was like thinking like um is it actually poisonous yeah

1152
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:25,520
okay xenomorph all right an alien diet nips okay a parasit i
requires okay that that's that's one yeah a parasitic

never watched to the future i don't i the only thing i know

1154
01:26:32,460 --> 01:26:40,040
about it is the fucking car that's the only thing i know
about back to the future and that he almost banged his mom

1155
01:26:40,860 --> 01:26:43,120

i thought i did for back to the future i only know that that
it it inspired rick and morty his name is marty m'fly He

1158
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:10,960
almost banged his mom and then the car because everyone
wants to have the car Apparently, it's getting harder and

1159
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:15,700
harder to build the car now because it's like the parts are
super old and like you know Like when you know the as it

1160
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:21,860
gets older like as the years keep passing by like it's
harder to find the actual parts to make the fucking car The

1161
01:27:21,860 --> 01:27:31,780
the the Lord the Delorean right the Delorean the Delorean
Yeah, and he has to go back to the future

1162
01:27:40,020 --> 01:27:43,940
I assume it's the one that lets you travel in time.

1163
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:45,580
Oh, yeah.

1164
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:47,680
DeLorean.

1165
01:27:48,020 --> 01:27:49,000
Yeah, there you go.

1166
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:50,780
This is the only time travel one.

1167
01:27:52,060 --> 01:27:53,020
Define unobtainium.

1168
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:54,060
It's unobtainable.

1169
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:54,560
Oh, yeah.

1170
01:27:54,700 --> 01:27:55,200
I remember.

1171
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:01,900
This is like my issue with like, basically James Cameron, it
looks amazing.

1172
01:28:01,980 --> 01:28:02,940
The movies look amazing.

1173
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:07,020
But two and three is like one, two, and three are all like
based.

1174
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:08,420
It's literally the same plot.

1175
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:12,140
The unobtainium is unattainable.

1176
01:28:12,380 --> 01:28:14,180
That's like, I fucking remember that.

1177
01:28:14,340 --> 01:28:15,880
Like, everyone always makes fun of that.

1178
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:17,800
It's so clever.

1179
01:28:18,260 --> 01:28:20,040
It's so unobtainable.

1180
01:28:24,420 --> 01:28:27,180
Yeah, that's so fucking stupid.

1181
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:33,840
Bro, I don't fucking remember.

1182
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:36,800
I only watched the first avatar movie.

1183
01:28:38,540 --> 01:28:39,940
I don't remember.

1184
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:43,160
Okay, I'll come back to this later.

1185
01:28:43,820 --> 01:28:45,820
Define Horcrux from Harry Potter.

1186
01:28:47,980 --> 01:28:48,560
Uh...

1187
01:28:49,380 --> 01:28:51,000
Where is it?

1188
01:28:52,900 --> 01:28:54,000
A dark...

1189
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,100
An object possess...

Yeah, this one.

1192
01:28:57,100 --> 01:28:58,800
Because he won an immortality.

1193
01:28:59,260 --> 01:29:02,040
Define droid from the Star Wars universe.

1194
01:29:06,460 --> 01:29:07,420
That's me this.

1195
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:08,060
Oh, my God.

1196
01:29:08,140 --> 01:29:09,940

I know it's in Wakanda.

1202
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:49,320
That's the 175.

1203
01:29:54,090 --> 01:29:57,030
Okay, the 5-Middeclorian.

1204
01:29:57,310 --> 01:30:00,310
I don't fucking, what the fuck is Middeclorian?

1205
01:30:01,510 --> 01:30:01,930
Uh.

1206
01:30:10,550 --> 01:30:11,990
I don't know this one.

1207
01:30:12,110 --> 01:30:12,730
Oh, yeah!

1208
01:30:14,010 --> 01:30:14,570
Yeah!

1209
01:30:15,110 --> 01:30:17,430
Okay, okay, I just gotta get this one right.

1210
01:30:17,430 --> 01:30:19,510
And then I have an IQ of 175.

1211
01:30:20,550 --> 01:30:21,410
It's very...

1212
01:30:21,410 --> 01:30:22,870
Don't know that.

1213
01:30:23,730 --> 01:30:24,010
All right.

1214
01:30:25,210 --> 01:30:25,650
Unobtainium.

1215
01:30:25,950 --> 01:30:26,190
Okay.

1216
01:30:26,590 --> 01:30:29,070
Well, obviously it's extremely rare mineral.

1217
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:30,690
But like they don't know how...

1218
01:30:30,690 --> 01:30:32,470
They don't do anything with unobtainium.

1219
01:30:32,650 --> 01:30:37,450
I know like the Avatar people don't know what to do with
unobtainium.

1220
01:30:37,630 --> 01:30:38,370
That's all I know.

1221
01:30:40,230 --> 01:30:42,510
But I know like the military wants it.

1222
01:30:42,530 --> 01:30:43,790
Because it's unobtainable.

1223
01:30:45,810 --> 01:30:46,250
Yeah.

1224
01:30:47,570 --> 01:30:55,970
it's like unobtainable where the fuck are the sky oh my god
it's literally like the avatar there's the fire people

1225
01:30:55,970 --> 01:31:03,570
there's the water people oh my god it's literally the avatar
because in the fourth movie we're gonna learn about the sky

1226
01:31:03,570 --> 01:31:10,810
avatars now because in the second one we learn about this
first one we learned about the earth avatars second one was

1227
01:31:10,810 --> 01:31:18,750
the water avatar third one was the fire and then the fourth
one we're gonna learn about the sky avatars ours now yeah

1228
01:31:18,750 --> 01:31:28,690
wait we started with the sky oh then the fourth one no no we
didn't start with the sky because apparently apparently the

1229
01:31:28,690 --> 01:31:36,970
sky ones actually live in like floating like like actual
like floating islands like yeah i know like but it's already

1230
01:31:36,970 --> 01:31:44,570
a float but there's like there's another there's a floating
floating island yeah no it's like beyond floating it's

1231
01:31:44,570 --> 01:31:45,950
beyond the first one

1232
01:31:49,850 --> 01:31:51,630
No, there's a different one.

1233
01:31:52,270 --> 01:31:54,810
It's another one that actually, like, they fly everywhere.

1234
01:31:56,410 --> 01:31:58,150
I was reading about it.

1235
01:31:58,250 --> 01:32:03,410
They're like, we're going to learn more about the other, the
flying, the floating island avatars.

1236
01:32:03,670 --> 01:32:07,390
And I was like, weren't they already on the floating rocks?

1237
01:32:07,610 --> 01:32:09,730
But they're like, apparently there's another avatar.

1238
01:32:10,210 --> 01:32:16,470
There's another species of these fucking blue aliens where
they're like, they actually control, like, the land, like,

1239
01:32:16,630 --> 01:32:17,110
and stuff.

1240
01:32:17,370 --> 01:32:18,590
Yeah, the note, yeah.

1241
01:32:19,950 --> 01:32:24,150
Yeah, they, like, hinted about them in Avatar 3 with the
Fire avatars.

1242
01:32:25,210 --> 01:32:27,150
So, like, the first one was actually Earth.

1243
01:32:29,190 --> 01:32:33,610
The fourth one will actually, like, are actually the flying
ones, the air ones.

1244
01:32:36,990 --> 01:32:37,710
That's crazy.

1245
01:32:38,350 --> 01:32:40,070
It's literally following the avatar.

1246
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:46,960
Alright.

1247
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:49,360
I don't fucking know this one.

1248
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:53,260
I, like, I don't think anyone actually pays attention to the
plot when they're watching guitar.

1249
01:32:54,140 --> 01:32:55,900
It's like an octaneum.

1250
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:00,200
Yeah.

1251
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:04,100
Like, I feel like, I don't know.

1252
01:33:04,220 --> 01:33:05,980
I don't know if anyone actually, oh, I did.

1253
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:10,600
I fucking watched it for the fucking plot.

1254
01:33:11,980 --> 01:33:12,680
I don't know.

1255
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:20,660
I feel like, okay, it's not engineered.

1256
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:22,280
I'll do process of elimination.

1257
01:33:22,820 --> 01:33:24,660
I know it's a rare material.

1258
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:27,100
So it's either two or, it's either three or four.

1259
01:33:27,820 --> 01:33:28,860
I know it's not two.

1260
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:30,680
Is that a three or four?

1261
01:33:33,830 --> 01:33:36,730
I'll say three because like energy.

1262
01:33:37,670 --> 01:33:38,250
Oh yay!

1263
01:33:40,270 --> 01:33:41,590
Nine out of ten!

1264
01:33:42,090 --> 01:33:44,430
That's like 170 guys.

1265
01:33:46,790 --> 01:33:51,770
That's like you scored better at 89% of all the other quiz
takers.

01:33:52,070 --> 01:33:52,870
Look at that.

Break up with your significant other, and we'll reveal which
Brooklyn 99 character you are.

1274
01:34:37,710 --> 01:34:37,790
All right.

01:34:37,890 --> 01:34:38,670
How do I do this?

1276
01:34:38,810 --> 01:34:38,990
Okay.

1277
01:34:39,450 --> 01:34:40,810
How do I do a breakup?

1278
01:34:41,370 --> 01:34:42,250
Start the breakup.

I have a proposal for you.

1280
01:34:44,750 --> 01:34:46,050

I cries.

1283
01:34:54,630 --> 01:34:56,190
I think that's the easiest.

1284
01:34:57,850 --> 01:34:59,890
and he'll feel sad for me.

1285
01:34:59,970 --> 01:35:02,930
Okay, Larry, you've been a good friend.

1286
01:35:03,330 --> 01:35:05,070
I feel like, yes, we should separate.

1287
01:35:05,530 --> 01:35:08,170
You've been a bit boring lately.

1288
01:35:08,810 --> 01:35:12,110
The artists that juiced up Captain America's dumpy for the
big stream are VTubers now.

1289
01:35:12,270 --> 01:35:13,050
But yeah, it's C.

01:35:13,210 --> 01:35:14,210
Are you serious?

1291
01:35:14,370 --> 01:35:15,590
I think it's crazy.

1292
01:35:16,870 --> 01:35:18,430
He's like, what's your resume?

1293
01:35:18,690 --> 01:35:19,470
I juiced up.

1294
01:35:19,670 --> 01:35:21,790
I juiced up Chris Evans' ass.

1295
01:35:22,150 --> 01:35:22,990
Thank you, the super chat.

1296
01:35:23,310 --> 01:35:23,790

1297
01:35:23,870 --> 01:35:24,630
Thank you.

1298
01:35:25,230 --> 01:35:27,830

1299
01:35:27,850 --> 01:35:32,970

01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:08,120
Okay, I gotta do that.

1303
01:36:09,980 --> 01:36:10,400
Okay.

1304
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:16,760
Uh, I feel like you're way too bad.

1305
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:19,400
I just can't find time for you.

1306
01:36:19,980 --> 01:36:21,420
You're just really weird.

1307
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:26,180
You're always so annoying and introducing me to people who
I'm not ready to see.

1308
01:36:26,460 --> 01:36:28,280
You never have time for me.

1309
01:36:30,380 --> 01:36:31,460
fucking boring.

1310
01:36:32,340 --> 01:36:32,340
Okay.

1311
01:36:32,940 --> 01:36:34,400
There's a lot of my play.

1312
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:36,900
I feel like I never see you anymore.

1313
01:36:37,380 --> 01:36:38,340
This just won't work.

1314
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:39,540
And I'm not into that.

1315
01:36:39,860 --> 01:36:42,980
And I don't really love you anymore.

1316
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:44,860
Holy shit.

1317
01:36:44,940 --> 01:36:47,520
This guy's going to have eternal trauma.

1318
01:36:48,060 --> 01:36:50,320
I don't want to be with you anymore.

1319
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:52,100
And I'm not into that.

1320
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:54,780
I just can't do this right now.

1321
01:36:55,300 --> 01:36:55,680
There's a lot.

1322
01:36:55,780 --> 01:36:57,080
I feel like I never see you.

1323
01:36:57,260 --> 01:36:57,380
Okay.

1324
01:36:57,380 --> 01:37:07,900
This is like the least other than that you're so boring
we're done that's why I want to break up this is the best

1325
01:37:07,900 --> 01:37:25,240

Yay!

1328
01:37:32,780 --> 01:37:34,960
I think it's the shake hands part.

1329
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:37,780
I know it's a...

1330
01:37:41,740 --> 01:37:43,100
You're boring.

1331
01:37:45,220 --> 01:37:50,000
You're a boss, and your breakup tactic is brutally honest
and with zero rewards.

1332
01:37:50,580 --> 01:37:55,060
You have more important things to be doing with your time
when dealing with someone who you don't mesh with.

1333
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:57,420
What can I say?

1334
01:37:57,520 --> 01:37:58,320
We don't mesh.

1335
01:37:58,760 --> 01:37:59,440
We just...

1336
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:02,360

1339
01:38:10,260 --> 01:38:17,620
If you need a hobby, 42 things to help you realize some of
your body-related problems have legit solutions.

1340
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:20,290

He always looks scared.

1348
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:05,900
Who's a vegetable?

1349
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:07,720
I don't like any of this.

1350
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:12,740
I mean, like, roasted broccoli is... Steam broccoli and
roasted broccoli is really good.

1351
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:13,780
So I'll choose that.

1352
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:14,740
Choose a console.

1353
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:20,020
I'm not going to get baited by nostalgia, so say
PlayStation.

1354
01:39:21,060 --> 01:39:22,940
PlayStation 2 was my favorite console.

1355
01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:25,040
Who's a stuffed animal?

01:39:25,380 --> 01:39:26,060

1366
01:40:59,980 --> 01:41:00,320
All right.

1367
01:41:01,060 --> 01:41:03,080
Just I'm taking a test again.

1368
01:41:03,380 --> 01:41:04,740
It's like, you know, driver's license.

1369
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:05,960
You got to take a test.

1370
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:11,320
You got to retake the test and make every like couple of
years to make sure you're a real Canadian.

1371
01:41:12,160 --> 01:41:16,980
So I have to come back and take the test again just to be
sure.

1372
01:41:17,580 --> 01:41:19,380
What's this phenomenon called?

1373
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:21,040
Oh, the War of Orialis.

1374
01:41:21,580 --> 01:41:22,060
That's easy.

1375
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:25,100
Versation right here in the middle of in your kitchen.

1376
01:41:25,820 --> 01:41:25,840
Okay.

1377
01:41:26,580 --> 01:41:28,080
What is this food called?

1378
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:29,580
Oh, it's a beaver's tail!

1379
01:41:30,020 --> 01:41:31,140
That shit's good!

1380
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:35,780
It's literally like a pastry with whatever the fuck you want
to put on top.

1381
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:36,520
That's literally it.

1382
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:37,740
And it looks like a beaver's tail.

1383
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:40,940
Like the pastry looks like a be- it's like fried pastry.

1384
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:45,160
And then like you can put like, like Nutella or like
whatever you want.

1385
01:41:45,240 --> 01:41:47,020
I like Nutella and bananas on top.

1386
01:41:47,460 --> 01:41:48,360
It's so good.

1387
01:41:48,680 --> 01:41:51,220
It's actually like a- it's like it's actually really fucking
good.

1388
01:41:54,450 --> 01:41:56,110
Yeah, because it looks like a tail.

1389
01:41:57,770 --> 01:42:00,670
Okay, Canadian coroner, Akerabu.

1390
01:42:00,830 --> 01:42:02,790
We had that lesson earlier, too.

1391
01:42:03,530 --> 01:42:05,010
We actually, we had that lesson.

1392
01:42:06,850 --> 01:42:10,170
That's why I'm like, why is the fucking 10 cents a goddamn
boat?

1393
01:42:10,270 --> 01:42:11,170
I don't understand.

1394
01:42:11,410 --> 01:42:13,290
We were doing so well with animals.

1395
01:42:13,810 --> 01:42:15,790
And then we just put a fucking boat.

1396
01:42:17,970 --> 01:42:20,650
I fucking put a random boat on it.

1397
01:42:21,730 --> 01:42:22,990
What is the nickname for coffee?

1398
01:42:23,370 --> 01:42:23,950
Order it with two.

1399
01:42:23,990 --> 01:42:25,450
Okay, actually, I don't know what this is.

1400
01:42:25,570 --> 01:42:26,090
Double drip.

1401
01:42:26,750 --> 01:42:27,450
Double, double.

1402
01:42:27,930 --> 01:42:29,150
Okay, how is that?

1403
01:42:29,250 --> 01:42:30,470
Oh, it's only a Tim Hortons.

1404
01:42:30,570 --> 01:42:32,130
Who the fuck goes to Tim Hortons anymore?

1405
01:42:32,530 --> 01:42:34,830
I don't think who the fuck goes to Tim Hortons for coffee.

1406
01:42:35,330 --> 01:42:38,350
Like, it's like, it's shitty coffee.

1407
01:42:39,530 --> 01:42:41,830
Not the double down.

1408
01:42:43,230 --> 01:42:53,550
Like, the only reason I go to Tim Hortons or Timmy's is for
ice caps and the donuts.

1409
01:42:54,810 --> 01:42:56,810
And the Timmy's, Timbits.

1410
01:42:58,030 --> 01:43:07,670
Timbits and ice caps the coffees fucking suck at Tim Hortons
what might I don't know when I start going to Tim Hortons

1411
01:43:07,670 --> 01:43:17,270
it's so fucking bad yeah what's the Edmonton's foot bro who
the fuck cares about Edmonton I'm here for the Canucks bro

1412
01:43:17,270 --> 01:43:26,950
what's the if we have a football team like I'm sorry If you
live in Edmonton, I'm sorry.

1413
01:43:27,270 --> 01:43:30,030
But like, they have a football team.

1414
01:43:30,790 --> 01:43:33,070
I thought that would exist in America.

1415
01:43:35,130 --> 01:43:36,210
For real.

1416
01:43:36,530 --> 01:43:37,010
I'm sorry.

1417
01:43:37,190 --> 01:43:39,690
I'm sorry if you live in Edmonton.

1418
01:43:42,870 --> 01:43:44,310
I didn't even know.

1419
01:43:44,970 --> 01:43:46,510
I didn't even know you guys have.

1420
01:43:46,570 --> 01:43:48,410
There was a Canadian League?

1421
01:43:49,250 --> 01:43:52,730
Like, I wouldn't understand it because it's like hockey.

1422
01:43:53,470 --> 01:43:54,390
But like...

1423
01:43:54,770 --> 01:43:58,290
We have, who's watching Canadian football?

1424
01:44:04,030 --> 01:44:06,810
You now watch the CFL.

1425
01:44:07,810 --> 01:44:08,770
I don't know.

1426
01:44:08,930 --> 01:44:09,830
I guess the Elks.

1427
01:44:10,390 --> 01:44:12,910
I was like, that's the most Canadian animal.

1428
01:44:13,550 --> 01:44:15,010
I was like, Eagles are American.

1429
01:44:15,650 --> 01:44:17,270
I don't think they care about emeralds.

1430
01:44:17,490 --> 01:44:18,210
And like, I don't know.

1431
01:44:18,610 --> 01:44:19,830
Why is it called Edison?

1432
01:44:19,950 --> 01:44:24,110
So when Thomas Edison is American, Elka seems the most
Canadian.

1433
01:44:24,330 --> 01:44:27,750
Oh my God, there is a Canadian football team.

1434
01:44:28,150 --> 01:44:31,710
Oh my god, we have a thing called CFL.

1435
01:44:32,690 --> 01:44:37,050
We have the top 10 biggest malls here, girl, in Edmonton.

1436
01:44:39,190 --> 01:44:40,010

Oh my god.

1441
01:44:49,680 --> 01:44:51,340
I didn't even realize we have a league.

1442
01:44:51,540 --> 01:44:53,080
I thought it was just America.

1443
01:44:55,200 --> 01:45:01,800
It's like how like the national, the, the, like, like, you
know, all like the basketball.

1444
01:45:01,820 --> 01:45:06,660
The top basketball, football, and baseball teams are all
just situated in America.

1445
01:45:07,620 --> 01:45:09,400
What is the longest river Fraser?

1446
01:45:10,180 --> 01:45:12,380
That's the only river I recognize.

1447
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:15,340
I don't know any of these other rivers.

1448
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:16,700
Yeah, there we go.

1449
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:19,880
What food was invented in Canada?

1450
01:45:21,540 --> 01:45:22,520
Oh, Graham Kra- Oh!

1451
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:27,140
Okay, never mind.

1452
01:45:27,720 --> 01:45:28,400
Never mind.

1453
01:45:31,820 --> 01:45:33,560
The ginger beef.

1456
01:45:40,940 --> 01:45:43,560
That was, I thought I was graham crackers.

1457
01:45:44,120 --> 01:45:45,380
It felt Canadian.

1458
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:50,620
Graham crackers was in fact invented in the US.

1459
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:51,400
Okay.

1460
01:45:52,040 --> 01:45:55,220
Oh, that's, I'm sad that we invented ginger beef.

1461
01:45:55,960 --> 01:45:57,740
It was you.

1462
01:45:58,700 --> 01:46:00,340

01:46:01,820 --> 01:46:03,720
What is Canada's national sport?

1464
01:46:04,140 --> 01:46:04,840
Hockey, of course.

1465
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:07,400
Hockey is cat.

1527
01:50:29,490 --> 01:50:30,570
What?

1528
01:50:30,950 --> 01:50:32,270
That doesn't matter.

1529
01:50:32,590 --> 01:50:34,330
The king doesn't own Canada.

1530
01:50:34,770 --> 01:50:35,950
We don't care.

1531
01:50:36,570 --> 01:50:38,990
What the fuck has King Charler's done for us?

1532
01:50:39,670 --> 01:50:44,410

Okay, wait, wait.

1535
01:50:49,090 --> 01:50:51,670
Canada coins 2024.

1536
01:50:51,870 --> 01:50:55,090
There's no fucking way they replaced it with the goddamn
king.

1537
01:50:55,590 --> 01:50:58,330
Oh my god, they fucking did.

1538
01:50:59,190 --> 01:51:01,050
Oh, Oh my god!

1539
01:51:01,330 --> 01:51:04,430
Don't keep that treason.

1540
01:51:05,170 --> 01:51:07,710
Oh my god, they did!

1541
01:51:08,590 --> 01:51:10,830
They replaced her!

1542
01:51:10,990 --> 01:51:13,110
They replaced her!

1543
01:51:15,770 --> 01:51:18,830
I'm so sad!

1544
01:51:22,230 --> 01:51:27,590
I can't believe they would do that to Queen Elizabeth II!

1545
01:51:29,490 --> 01:51:30,070
You know what's cool?

1546
01:51:30,750 --> 01:51:33,910
You see her age in our coins, like when she gets older.

1547
01:51:36,190 --> 01:51:37,110
I'll show you guys.

1548
01:51:38,130 --> 01:51:43,790
Like, as she gets older, they actually change, like, the
coin to, like, reflect their being old.

1549
01:51:44,810 --> 01:51:46,150
That's actually crazy.

1550
01:51:46,870 --> 01:51:49,350
Like, Queen Elizabeth, coin, Canada.

1551
01:51:51,110 --> 01:51:51,810
I like that.

1552
01:51:52,130 --> 01:51:55,410
It was, like, I thought it was really cool that they did
that.

1553
01:51:56,330 --> 01:51:59,470
And so you can be like, oh, my God, this is when she was
like, when she was free.

1554
01:51:59,490 --> 01:52:00,290
first queen.

1555
01:52:01,290 --> 01:52:04,450
I can't believe they changed it.

1556
01:52:05,350 --> 01:52:07,950
Why would they do such a thing?

1557
01:52:08,970 --> 01:52:10,190
I think is this the right one?

1558
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:10,610
Yeah.

1559
01:52:12,330 --> 01:52:18,150
So as she gets older, the coins like matched her age,
basically.

1560
01:52:20,170 --> 01:52:22,290
I think this was, I don't know if this was the Canadian one.

1561
01:52:23,490 --> 01:52:24,530
It's close enough.

1562
01:52:25,810 --> 01:52:26,850
Wait, it might be this one.

1563
01:52:27,290 --> 01:52:27,830
There you go.

1564
01:52:30,770 --> 01:52:39,330
yeah bro of course she was oh she like out she like was
queen for like like like when america had six different

1565
01:52:39,330 --> 01:52:46,910
presidents she was queen for all six of them you would see
like pictures of her like next to the president of the

1566
01:52:46,910 --> 01:52:51,010
united states of america would like for like six plus
presidents

1567
01:52:57,320 --> 01:53:02,000
i can't believe it now i shouldn't say that's treason

1568
01:53:05,820 --> 01:53:07,680
Now what, Toki?

1569
01:53:08,020 --> 01:53:10,000
Now what's going on with the...

1570
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:10,800
I have nothing.

1571
01:53:12,860 --> 01:53:13,980
Long live the king.

1572
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:15,660
Long live the king.

1573
01:53:19,460 --> 01:53:22,860
You're making it sound like she has lived.

1574
01:53:26,520 --> 01:53:27,240
Nothing.

1575
01:53:32,220 --> 01:53:34,780
Which famous person is not from Canada?

1576
01:53:39,090 --> 01:53:40,870
Okay, Reynolds and Rogan.

1577
01:53:41,070 --> 01:53:42,590
I know, Seth Rogan's actually Canadian.

1578
01:53:45,370 --> 01:53:49,370
I think Keanu... It's either Keanu Reeves or Meg.

1579
01:53:49,410 --> 01:53:52,090
I have no idea who the fuck Meg Ryan is.

1580
01:53:52,150 --> 01:53:53,250
It's either of these two.

1581
01:53:53,570 --> 01:53:56,250
I feel like it should be Keanu Reeves, right?

1582
01:53:56,970 --> 01:53:58,930
Oh, it's Meg Ryan's?

1583
01:53:59,550 --> 01:54:01,530
Keanu Reeves is Canadian?

1584
01:54:02,790 --> 01:54:03,850
Oh my god.

1585
01:54:04,130 --> 01:54:06,270
I did not know he was Canadian.

1586
01:54:06,490 --> 01:54:09,870
He's living in America for so fucking I don't know who Meg
Ryan is.

1587
01:54:10,230 --> 01:54:11,790
What the fuck does she do?

1588
01:54:12,450 --> 01:54:13,130
Meg Ryan.

1589
01:54:13,950 --> 01:54:16,130
I was like, I don't know who she is.

1590
01:54:17,530 --> 01:54:18,230

He's still alive.

1618

Alright.

1716
02:04:41,660 --> 02:04:42,760
Oh, someone's like, did you watch?

1717
02:04:42,800 --> 02:04:43,720
Yes, I watched my hands.

1718
02:04:43,880 --> 02:04:44,200
That's crazy.

1719
02:04:44,260 --> 02:04:51,660
That person that was it the best ad, the best, like, free
shout out for those 3D trackers.

1720
02:04:51,840 --> 02:05:01,300
And then she didn't wash her hands And then her fucking
channel got suspended I assume because she peed on stream So

1721
02:05:01,300 --> 02:05:08,600
then Twitch was like I assume that's why she got banned
Apparently like there was this girl Who was like She was

1722
02:05:08,600 --> 02:05:17,700
like oh I didn't She was like trying to during the middle of
her 3D stream She got like Suspended Like she like went to

1723
02:05:17,700 --> 02:05:24,780
use the bathroom But she didn't realize that her trackers
were tracking her when she went to the bathroom because it

1724
02:05:24,780 --> 02:05:31,020
was like really far away um and then she didn't realize the
range was that far um it was like the best like free ad that

1725
02:05:31,020 --> 02:05:37,020
the tracker company ever got because of it because they're
like oh my god it works even that far away um and then she

1726
02:05:37,020 --> 02:05:43,000
didn't wash your hands and everybody was like oh my god she
also didn't wash your hands after she peed but the thing was

1727
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:55,040
um right after that her her channel got bad she got she got
that and people assume that it's because you're not

1728
02:05:55,040 --> 02:06:03,160
technically you're not allowed to show yourself being you
know because it's like against the terms of service because

1729
02:06:03,160 --> 02:06:16,540
like she wasn't streaming anything else other than that so
twitch suspended her her twitch account all right but yeah

1730
02:06:16,540 --> 02:06:26,400
no apparently um the um the free ad like the what is it
called the product placement was so good like the um for it

1731
02:06:26,400 --> 02:06:32,140
like it was just just a good way to advertise this product
that they actually sold out because of it like everyone

1732
02:06:32,140 --> 02:06:37,620
bought the trackers because it's like really cheap too it's
like it's like what was it it was like less than a hundred

1733
02:06:37,620 --> 02:06:47,340
dollars or something was it less yeah it was like less than
a hundred dollars or something yeah free advertisement it's

1734
02:06:47,340 --> 02:06:54,300
like a hundred or two it's either less than a hundred or a
hundred and two hundred uh which is like really cheap for uh

1735
02:06:54,300 --> 02:07:04,580
for trackers yeah because like vibe trackers are so fucking
expensive in general so the fact that it's cheaper that is

1736
02:07:04,580 --> 02:07:13,780
cheaper than vibe trackers and like uh it's 260 or was i
don't remember i just remember it was like really cheap for

1737
02:07:13,780 --> 02:07:27,180
for like six plus trackers or something would you try what
food from 200 is really good for 3d tracking for like six

1738
02:07:27,180 --> 02:07:39,530
plus trackers because it's like uh yeah six to seven
trackers for 200 because like vibe trackers are like for

1739
02:07:39,530 --> 02:07:46,630
everything you gotta get the base stations you gotta get
like the individual tracker things that you have to wear um

1740
02:07:46,630 --> 02:07:52,310
you have to get the Um, because I need to get, like, three
base stations instead of two.

1741
02:07:53,090 --> 02:07:55,730
Um, and then you have to get the individual tracker things
and get three of them.

1742
02:07:55,890 --> 02:07:58,210
They're, like, 300, they're, like, at least $400.

1743
02:07:59,550 --> 02:08:00,990
And that's three trackers.

1744
02:08:07,070 --> 02:08:08,470
I remember it's, like, at least 400.

1745
02:08:09,590 --> 02:08:12,630
I just don't remember how much it was in total.

1746
02:08:15,530 --> 02:08:18,210
What fruit from SpongeBob would you try if you're given the
chance?

1747
02:08:18,410 --> 02:08:20,310
I want a crabby patty.

1748
02:08:22,330 --> 02:08:22,690

wasn't it oh wait let me grab tissues real quick too I

1750
02:08:34,870 --> 02:08:35,950
didn't blow my nose

1751
02:08:54,390 --> 02:09:04,030
yeah it was just a it was just a square it was just a square
burger but like the bird the patty was so dry but like a

1752
02:09:04,030 --> 02:09:12,270
crabby patty is like homemade so it should be like you know
not fast food because

1753
02:09:19,690 --> 02:09:30,630
it's homemade by sponge bob it's literally like the crusty
crab is in a fast food restaurant they forgot to add the

1754
02:09:30,630 --> 02:09:45,030
love okay choose a dish from ratatouille i will say the
omelet only because okay ratatouille they like make it sound

1755
02:09:45,030 --> 02:09:53,370
so good but my first got when i finally got ratatou in real
life it's literally just vegetables like cut together like

1756
02:09:53,370 --> 02:10:02,050
it's like a vegetable like it's just vegetables just clamped
up together it's there it's not it's nothing it's like i

1757
02:10:02,050 --> 02:10:10,030
rather just get omni it's like they made it sound like it's
like some fucking like like exquisite cuisine it's like

1758
02:10:10,030 --> 02:10:20,630
bougie so fucking fancy and then it's just it's just a It's
just a hot, a warm vegetable salad.

1759
02:10:21,590 --> 02:10:21,870
Yeah.

1760
02:10:22,930 --> 02:10:25,090
They look so good in a movie, though.

1761
02:10:26,150 --> 02:10:28,490
Pick up food from the Simpsons.

1762
02:10:28,950 --> 02:10:29,690
Oh, my God.

1763
02:10:29,770 --> 02:10:32,830
Okay, you know how, like...

1764
02:10:33,830 --> 02:10:34,230
Um...

1765
02:10:36,730 --> 02:10:41,430
Yeah, I remember it was like peasant food because, like, um,
in the end, it's like...

1766
02:10:41,430 --> 02:10:42,050
What was it?

1767
02:10:42,230 --> 02:10:45,090
He, like, it reminded him back when he was young.

1768
02:10:45,230 --> 02:10:49,770
And that's what, like, it gave him a flashback of a back but
then they made it look so fucking good and then all the

1769
02:10:49,770 --> 02:10:55,470
fancy restaurants started selling ratatouille too i think
because of the because of the movie buff like if you ever go

1770
02:10:55,470 --> 02:11:02,010
to french restaurants they'll sell ratatouille or some shit
and then like so i was like oh ratatouille and then like it

1773
02:11:18,550 --> 02:11:21,310
What was that McDonald's burger?

1774
02:11:22,790 --> 02:11:23,390
Magrib?

1775
02:11:24,150 --> 02:11:31,870
I tried a Magrib the last time I was in America because I
always see everyone.

1776
02:11:32,350 --> 02:11:35,950
Because like the Magrib is you can only get the Magrib in
America.

1777
02:11:36,230 --> 02:11:37,650
Like we don't have them in Canada.

1778
02:11:38,250 --> 02:11:53,490
And like I don't it's it's pretty mid I'm like it's pretty
there's so I would it's pretty mid I was like I don't know

1779
02:11:53,490 --> 02:12:00,070
if every time you know like family guy and the Simpsons are
always talking about like the McRib and then like you know

1780
02:12:00,070 --> 02:12:06,050
like the family guy clip where he's like oh my god it's back
guys it's back did you hear like I heard I heard this is it

1781
02:12:06,050 --> 02:12:11,450
guys what we practiced before Yeah, it's McMib.

1782
02:12:11,870 --> 02:12:14,390
I would say the McRib is pretty McMib.

1783
02:12:17,890 --> 02:12:19,810
The McRib is back.

1784
02:12:20,690 --> 02:12:21,690
You know what's good?

1785
02:12:21,850 --> 02:12:29,090
Okay, I want to try steamed ham, so pick up food from Jibli.

1786
02:12:32,090 --> 02:12:34,230
Now, Jibli knows how to make good food.

1787
02:12:37,030 --> 02:12:37,670
Um...

1788
02:12:39,410 --> 02:12:40,010
Hmm.

1789
02:12:40,870 --> 02:12:42,010
Wait, that's an onigiri?

1790
02:12:43,630 --> 02:12:44,450
What the fuck?

1791
02:12:45,930 --> 02:12:47,610
I did not realize that it's an onigiri.

1792
02:12:47,790 --> 02:12:50,430
I would say the breakfast.

1793
02:12:50,910 --> 02:12:51,770
I want the breakfast.

1794
02:12:51,950 --> 02:12:54,610
I want Calcifer's breakfast.

1795
02:12:56,450 --> 02:12:56,830
I don't know.

1796
02:12:58,010 --> 02:12:59,150
Kiki's pancakes?

1797
02:13:00,070 --> 02:13:02,330
I'm not a huge fan of pancakes.

1798
02:13:02,670 --> 02:13:06,030
I like Belgium waffles more than pancakes, to be fair.

1799
02:13:06,530 --> 02:13:07,770
The Ponyos ham ramen.

1800
02:13:09,210 --> 02:13:12,730
but then I saw like someone recreated that, but it's just
instant ramen.

1801
02:13:13,410 --> 02:13:18,530
Like Literally, it's just like... I like Belgium waffles
more than pancakes.

1802
02:13:19,070 --> 02:13:28,750
Or it's either Belgium waffles or um Or Japanese pancakes
because they're more fluffy But I know this isn't Japanese

1803
02:13:28,750 --> 02:13:32,290
pancakes because it's like regular pancakes because it's
like based off of...

1804
02:13:32,670 --> 02:13:35,770
I assume like this is based off of Europe.

1805
02:13:36,270 --> 02:13:36,590
Like right?

1806
02:13:36,830 --> 02:13:37,870
Kiki's delivery service?

1807
02:13:39,170 --> 02:13:39,730
right?

1808
02:13:40,950 --> 02:13:49,830
Because the book was, a lot of people who don't know this,
but a lot of the films that Stoogibli do adaptations on is

1809
02:13:49,830 --> 02:13:55,610
just based off of like European stories, like European like
novels or children's books.

1810
02:13:56,090 --> 02:14:02,310
So a lot of the stories are based in like actually in
Europe, like the original novels that it comes from.

1811
02:14:04,170 --> 02:14:06,110
Yeah, because like they're not original movies.

1812
02:14:06,670 --> 02:14:10,450
A lot of the Aren't original films.

1813
02:14:10,990 --> 02:14:16,050
They're actually like adaptations of like, like novels and
stuff.

1814
02:14:18,470 --> 02:14:20,050
Or children's books.

1815
02:14:21,090 --> 02:14:21,310
Yeah.

1816
02:14:24,270 --> 02:14:27,510
Because some people think it's like original films, but
they're not.

1817
02:14:27,550 --> 02:14:28,810
It's like how Lady and the Tramp.

1818
02:14:29,290 --> 02:14:34,430
It's like how Disney did a lot of them were based off of
like novels, adaptations.

1819
02:14:36,210 --> 02:14:39,190
It's like Lady and the Tramp was originally based off.

1820
02:14:39,210 --> 02:14:52,590
of a book and like originally like none of like like Walt
Disney had to like hard push for uh I think it was like I

1821
02:14:52,590 --> 02:14:58,830
think okay I think I remember I'm trying to remember the
story about this but um because I I have the I have the

1822
02:14:58,830 --> 02:15:08,090
platinum I used to own the platinum DVD of Lady and the
Tramp you know they always do like back then I don't know

1823
02:15:08,090 --> 02:15:11,850
they still do it but Disney will release DVDs and then
they'll be like, oh, it's going to go to Disney Vault.

1824
02:15:11,970 --> 02:15:12,490
Don't buy it.

1825
02:15:12,550 --> 02:15:17,930
And it'll be like platinum edition, diamond edition, gold
edition of various movies.

1826
02:15:18,090 --> 02:15:20,530
And he's like, if you don't buy it, we're going to put it in
the Disney Vault.

1827
02:15:20,870 --> 02:15:24,390
So I had like the platinum edition of Lady in the Tramp.

1828
02:15:24,910 --> 02:15:34,030
And like, I think it was like, like Walt Disney wanted to do
an original film, but people were like, um, yeah.

1829
02:15:34,310 --> 02:15:37,870
So basically it was originally an original story.

1830
02:15:38,390 --> 02:15:45,610
And, That was pitched to Walt Disney and he really wanted to
do it But then like the board was like no Because like we've

1831
02:15:45,610 --> 02:15:54,170
always done like adaptations of stuff We're like he like has
like visors and stuff We're like don't do it It's too risky

1832
02:15:54,170 --> 02:16:04,390
We've always done adaptations And then he told the writer to
He told the writer to publish a book about this So he can

1833
02:16:04,390 --> 02:16:10,870
like do like an adaptation of it So, like, to do, like, a
loophole, being like, see, it's an adaptation, guys.

1834
02:16:11,210 --> 02:16:12,210
The book was published.

1835
02:16:12,290 --> 02:16:13,630
It's not an original story.

1836
02:16:16,250 --> 02:16:18,270
Yeah, so they're like, he's like, guys, see?

1837
02:16:18,430 --> 02:16:20,250
It's not an original story, guys.

1838
02:16:20,430 --> 02:16:21,730
It's a book.

1839
02:16:21,870 --> 02:16:22,610
It's from a book.

1840
02:16:29,570 --> 02:16:29,930
Yeah.

1841
02:16:29,930 --> 02:16:31,190

1843
02:16:33,490 --> 02:16:34,190
I was a...

1844
02:16:34,910 --> 02:16:36,050
I'm not a Disney adult.

1845
02:16:36,130 --> 02:16:37,170
I was a Disney child.

1846
02:16:39,830 --> 02:16:49,130
that's different I was a Disney child not a Disney adult I
just really I really like Disney back then oh yeah I would

1847
02:16:49,130 --> 02:16:56,630
say that's why I won't pick the ramen only because like um
because like I saw someone recreate it and it was just

1848
02:16:56,630 --> 02:17:04,930
instant ramen I'd rather have like ramen ramen because like
that's what it was it was Ponyo like Ponyo the mom just made

1849
02:17:04,930 --> 02:17:13,510
instant ramen for her and then cut like So I'll take the
I'll take You can't really mess up bacon and eggs

1850
02:17:18,590 --> 02:17:24,610
Or only Gary But it depends on what this is I don't know
what that is in the filling Because there's some fillings I

1851
02:17:24,610 --> 02:17:31,910
don't like I would say the bento But this I know I forgot
what this is called But I'm not a fan of this Top part over

1852
02:17:31,910 --> 02:17:40,150

really like pie I never really like pie it's a donut of

1853
02:17:40,150 --> 02:17:42,090
course it's jelly filled donut

1854
02:17:46,530 --> 02:17:54,290
i know it's the eggs but it's not actual row it's not like
the normal row you see on sushi it's a different type of row

1855
02:17:54,290 --> 02:18:07,410
and i never like that type of row so i'm gonna go with i
will go with bacon and eggs from for my colorado heart I'm

1856
02:18:07,410 --> 02:18:13,570
not a huge fan there's like I'm very picky with instant
ramen I rather do because like if I had to choose between

1857
02:18:13,570 --> 02:18:21,650
instant ramen or instant udon I will pick instant udon
versus instant ramen I just feel like um I just love or like

1858
02:18:21,650 --> 02:18:28,930
mix or like mixed ramen like the microwave ramen where you
um I just got like because like I when I lived in Asia

1859
02:18:28,930 --> 02:18:35,470
there's so many different types of like um instant ramen or
like instant udon so there's lots of choices it wasn't just

1860
02:18:35,470 --> 02:18:44,530
like instant ramen so microwave ramen where it's like where
it's like um it's um you like do like mix some sauce in the

1861
02:18:44,530 --> 02:18:49,990
mix some sauce in the ramen and then you pour some water and
then you microwave it and it's so good there's like

1862
02:18:49,990 --> 02:18:56,310
carbonara ramen and shit like that it's so fucking good so
that's why I'm like for me I'm not like an instant ramen

1863
02:18:56,310 --> 02:19:03,170
like just the broth instant ramen type thing I just I I like
like if I had to choose like broth kind where I have to have

1864
02:19:03,170 --> 02:19:06,470
the broth in there I would choose instant Udom versus
instant ramen.

1865
02:19:09,250 --> 02:19:13,130
No, no, there's like, it's like specific, because it's like,
um, it's like a mixed ramen thing.

1866
02:19:13,670 --> 02:19:23,090
Um, and it's like, basically, you put a little bit of water,
and then you mix it, you put like, it's like, um, um, it's

1867
02:19:23,090 --> 02:19:27,150
like, it's like, you have to microwave it, um, too.

1868
02:19:27,250 --> 02:19:33,850
It's not like you can't, uh, I don't remember what it's
called, but it was one of my favorite instant ramen, so

02:23:14,710 --> 02:23:14,990
Wait.

1928
02:23:17,750 --> 02:23:19,110
This is DreamWorks?

1929
02:23:19,970 --> 02:23:20,930
There's no way.

1930
02:23:21,610 --> 02:23:24,590
No, Wallace and Gromit just has his own studio.

1931
02:23:26,310 --> 02:23:27,070
Oh, is that Shrek?

1932
02:23:27,110 --> 02:23:28,290
Oh, yeah, that's Shrek right there.

1933
02:23:28,310 --> 02:23:28,990
I see him.

1934
02:23:29,930 --> 02:23:30,450
What?

1935
02:23:31,430 --> 02:23:35,730
Wait, Wallace and Gromit is owned by DreamWorks?

1936
02:23:36,370 --> 02:23:38,410
I did not know that.

1937
02:23:40,610 --> 02:23:43,210
Oh, it was funded by DreamWorks.

1938
02:23:43,330 --> 02:23:44,150
I'm going to do dumplings.

1939
02:23:45,170 --> 02:23:46,110
I'm on Pixar!

1940
02:23:47,030 --> 02:23:47,530
Oh, no.

1941
02:23:47,650 --> 02:23:48,270
Is it pre?

1942
02:23:48,750 --> 02:23:53,550
Okay, but is it pre-sequel Pixar or like...

1943
02:23:54,810 --> 02:23:58,990
Or after-sequel Pixar, though.

1944
02:24:00,710 --> 02:24:02,530
Which Pixar is it?

1945
02:24:03,910 --> 02:24:04,750
There's...

1946
02:24:07,330 --> 02:24:11,250
Yeah, pre-merge Pixar or after-merge Pixar.

1947
02:24:16,650 --> 02:24:19,570
The world has way of making everything seem beautiful and
hopeful.

1948
02:24:19,790 --> 02:24:23,670
Even death, toys come to life, robots fall in love, and a
rat cooks for your meals.

1949
02:24:23,850 --> 02:24:24,050
Yeah!

1950
02:24:24,630 --> 02:24:26,410
Okay, it's pre-merge Pixar.

1951
02:24:30,580 --> 02:24:31,180
So it was 20.

1952
02:24:31,240 --> 02:24:39,140
Well, so it was good, but it was just, it didn't get the
hype because it released during covet era it should have

1953
02:24:39,140 --> 02:24:46,900
deserved more attention i feel like so was really fucking
good but yeah like i said um it just released at a bad time

1954
02:24:46,900 --> 02:24:55,320
same with like was it on kanto on kanto is disney it's not
pixar but it released during a bad time where it just was

1955
02:24:55,320 --> 02:25:08,300
just like in disney plus only um so like so like not a lot
of people talked about it till after yeah yeah all right

1956
02:25:08,300 --> 02:25:14,500
inside out two i don't understand how inside two made so
much fucking money but like inside out two was literally

1957
02:25:14,500 --> 02:25:22,220
like inside out one but like it's like joy never learned her
lesson it's literally like it's like they're like we all

1958
02:25:22,220 --> 02:25:29,780
learned a lesson today in inside out one and then in inside
out two it's like anyway we forgot our lesson so let's redo

1959
02:25:29,780 --> 02:25:32,680
all of this again Like, yeah.

1960
02:25:37,800 --> 02:25:38,280
That's the thing.

1961
02:25:38,320 --> 02:25:39,640
I watched Inside Out, too.

1962
02:25:39,720 --> 02:25:41,780
I wasn't like, I wasn't a fan of it.

1963
02:25:41,900 --> 02:25:44,640
But apparently it made more money than Inside, the first
Inside Out.

1964
02:25:44,780 --> 02:25:46,440
And it was like, it was like a box.

1965
02:25:46,520 --> 02:25:50,620
It was like, it broke the top 10 for animated movies for
that year.

1966
02:25:51,940 --> 02:25:59,040
Um, but like, like she, she was, it was just not a, I'm not
a huge, I wasn't a huge fan of Inside Out, too.

1967
02:25:59,180 --> 02:26:00,280
Like the story was.

1968
02:26:00,880 --> 02:26:01,280
Um.

1969
02:26:04,300 --> 02:26:08,740
and like uh what is it

1970
02:26:12,040 --> 02:26:18,640
it is really big internationally i won't be surprised if it
was because i know inside out was is really popular in asia

1971
02:26:18,640 --> 02:26:19,760
same with zutopia 2.

1972
02:26:20,160 --> 02:26:27,770
zutopia 2 is like the most popular animated movie that
disney has ever made i think so far

1973
02:26:34,550 --> 02:26:47,570
as of international market uh market for those who don't
know i personally thought The plot of Zootopia 2, I was not

1974
02:26:47,570 --> 02:26:52,950
a fan of, like, certain parts of the plot for Zootopia 2.

1975
02:26:54,930 --> 02:26:57,730
And I hated the twist villain.

1976
02:27:00,870 --> 02:27:05,650
I was not a fan of it being another twist villain.

1977
02:27:06,110 --> 02:27:10,450
Because the last, I swear to God, ever since...

1978
02:27:11,350 --> 02:27:21,810
since Frozen all we get is twist villains and I'm fucking
tired of that shit like it's just it's like Frozen big hero

1979
02:27:21,810 --> 02:27:30,990
6 um Zootopia 2 I can name so many but I need like fucking
pull up a list because no one keeps tracking modern Disney

1980
02:27:30,990 --> 02:27:40,310
anymore there's no good villains I love good villains and
like every Disney modern Disney movie is just twist villains

1981
02:27:40,310 --> 02:27:44,170
ever since fucking Hans because everyone was like, oh, Hans,
you know?

1982
02:27:44,270 --> 02:27:44,910
Oh yeah, Coco.

1983
02:27:45,650 --> 02:27:50,230
All right, Coco twist villain was actually good because you
get to, there's a build up.

1984
02:27:50,590 --> 02:27:57,210
I think the thing about Coco's twist villain is that there
was foreshadowing that he was a twist villain, you know?

1985
02:27:57,390 --> 02:28:02,570
Um, like for Coco, like you could tell like there's
something wrong with that guy.

1986
02:28:02,730 --> 02:28:05,370
Like, because you, you know, he's like, um, you're my
grandpa.

1987
02:28:05,630 --> 02:28:16,010
And he was like, you know, and then they kept hiding he's
not the grandpa is he and so then you're like so there's

1988
02:28:16,010 --> 02:28:22,910
like a build up to it for the like it like for the twist
villain but like um there's like like big hero six was like

1989
02:28:22,910 --> 02:28:29,830
fucking out of nowhere hans was out of nowhere he's like i'm
so good i'm such a nice guy uh and also like for coco the

1990
02:28:29,830 --> 02:28:37,550
twist villain for coco um it was more so of like um also
coco it was like it's not like fully Disney too.

1991
02:28:39,330 --> 02:28:44,330
But like for Coco for the twist villain, like even at the
beginning he was like super egotistical and everything like

1992
02:28:44,330 --> 02:28:44,930
you could tell.

1993
02:28:45,430 --> 02:28:52,450
Like they were saying like oh yeah like he's like super
egotistical and everything so you know he's not like that

1994
02:28:52,450 --> 02:28:53,270
good of a guy.

1995
02:28:53,550 --> 02:28:57,410
So like when he turns out he was a villain you're like oh
yeah yeah that makes sense.

1996
02:28:57,730 --> 02:28:59,810
Like yeah

1997
02:29:03,450 --> 02:29:13,890
but like a lot of of the modern Disney films and modern
Pixar films like it's like even I would say even like Toy

1998
02:29:13,890 --> 02:29:21,290
Story 3 when they made like the oh yeah by the way the bear
is so fucking popular in Asia I have no idea why I think

1999
02:29:21,290 --> 02:29:27,450
it's because he's a teddy bear and like Japan loves teddy
bears in general like um a lot of things like that's not

2000
02:29:27,450 --> 02:29:34,690
popular in America is so fucking popular in Japan like I
know like a lot so yeah lots so is like so popular in in

2001
02:29:34,690 --> 02:29:46,390
Japan specific specifically to there's like so much merch of
lots so in Japan and also um lots so Ted uh Ted the bear yes

2002
02:29:46,390 --> 02:29:56,970
the Seth McFarland Ted is very popular in Japan as well and
there's like this teddy bear series in Tokyo Disneyland I

2003
02:29:56,970 --> 02:30:03,810
forgot what's his name is but he used to be a originally it
was supposed to be a mascot um in in america but he didn't

2004
02:30:03,810 --> 02:30:12,230
do so well so they just but he was super popular in japan
and kept it there i won't forget how wish's villain had a

2005
02:30:12,230 --> 02:30:18,570
great point was like okay now he's getting too relatable
turn him bad but stop the super chat thank you thank you oh

2006
02:30:18,570 --> 02:30:25,910
my god you're one of a few people that actually watch wish
like yeah duffy duffy he didn't do well in america he didn't

2007
02:30:25,910 --> 02:30:33,430
test so well in america but he he tested really well in
japan so they like kept him there cafe for Ted.

2008
02:30:33,790 --> 02:30:35,370
That's how popular he is in Japan.

2009
02:30:43,190 --> 02:30:46,370
Yeah, so that's why I was like, I'm just tired of twist
villains in general.

2010
02:30:46,590 --> 02:30:47,410
Like, they just don't know.

2011
02:30:48,050 --> 02:30:50,870
They just, like, just don't know how to write good villains
anymore.

2012
02:30:51,250 --> 02:30:56,790
Like, the classic villains, the classic Disney villains, you
know how, like, villains are so popular in Disneyland, or,

2013
02:30:56,790 --> 02:31:00,010
like, just Disney in general, like, with all the merch being
like, oh, I love villains.

2014
02:31:00,310 --> 02:31:05,450
But they're always from old Disney, the classic Disney,
never in modern Disney, because they just don't know how to

2015
02:31:05,450 --> 02:31:06,170
write good villains.

2016
02:31:06,530 --> 02:31:09,170
Because, classic Disney The villains are actually evil.

2017
02:31:09,330 --> 02:31:10,550
There's no redemption for them.

2018
02:31:10,970 --> 02:31:11,630
And that's fine.

2019
02:31:11,730 --> 02:31:12,770
Like, I'm fine with that.

2020
02:31:13,070 --> 02:31:14,510
Let them be evil.

2021
02:31:15,270 --> 02:31:17,390
Like, yeah.

2022
02:31:17,850 --> 02:31:19,010
Like, we don't care.

2023
02:31:19,130 --> 02:31:20,250
Like, they don't need redemption.

2024
02:31:20,750 --> 02:31:21,950
Some people are just evil.

2025
02:31:22,770 --> 02:31:32,450
Like, just embrace, they're, like, just embrace, embrace it.

2026
02:31:36,080 --> 02:31:37,200
I love Jack Corner.

2027
02:31:37,360 --> 02:31:38,320
I always talk about it.

2028
02:31:38,500 --> 02:31:40,580
I always, like, somehow always bring up Jack Corner.

2029
02:31:40,740 --> 02:31:41,200
But he was dead.

2030
02:31:41,240 --> 02:31:42,160
He's, like, my favorite villain.

2031
02:31:42,180 --> 02:31:44,020
Like, he's my favorite modern villain.

2032
02:31:44,900 --> 02:31:47,080
He's like, how did you become a villain?

2033
02:31:47,240 --> 02:31:47,840
Oh, not much.

2034
02:31:48,180 --> 02:31:54,100
Just have a great family, rich, you know.

2035
02:32:01,680 --> 02:32:03,360
I love Puss in Boots villains.

2036
02:32:03,540 --> 02:32:04,840
They are so good at writing.

2037
02:32:05,100 --> 02:32:10,940
Okay, I will say Puss in Boots is so good at writing
villains.

2038
02:32:11,080 --> 02:32:14,120
Whoever the writers are who make the villains for Puss in
Boots.

2039
02:32:14,440 --> 02:32:16,560
Puss in Boots won with the fucking Humpty Dumpty.

2040
02:32:17,580 --> 02:32:30,620
always there that's such a good clip i like he left that
clip he's like that's right i was always there and he's just

2041
02:32:30,620 --> 02:32:39,860
like bro and all the clips of him like fucking like he was
there he was always there and then and then push and boots

2042
02:32:39,860 --> 02:32:48,140
too with jack harider and also literal death himself too
scene.

2043
02:32:58,510 --> 02:33:00,250
Oh yeah, you're getting a new Strek.

2044
02:33:00,390 --> 02:33:01,850
I don't know how I feel about it.

2045
02:33:02,890 --> 02:33:03,430
I don't know.

2046
02:33:03,710 --> 02:33:05,410
Like Zendaya's gonna be the daughter.

2047
02:33:07,150 --> 02:33:07,630
Strek.

2048
02:33:07,850 --> 02:33:09,570
I don't know how I feel about it.

2049
02:33:12,650 --> 02:33:16,290
Me when watching Doki get me to take you with the super
chat.

2050
02:33:16,530 --> 02:33:16,670
Thank you.

2051
02:33:17,070 --> 02:33:17,490
Thank you.

2052
02:33:18,850 --> 02:33:19,610
I don't know.

2053
02:33:20,970 --> 02:33:23,230
Yeah, Zendaya's gonna be the daughter.

2054
02:33:23,410 --> 02:33:24,170
One of the daughters.

2055
02:33:25,090 --> 02:33:27,590
But I'm like, what about his two sons, you know?

2056
02:33:30,150 --> 02:33:32,330
Why did it focus on Zenday?

2057
02:33:35,230 --> 02:33:43,910
Because then it's like, because like, you could tell where
it's heading for because it's like um, because she's a

2058
02:33:43,910 --> 02:33:45,050
teenager now.

2059
02:33:46,210 --> 02:33:47,570
She's a teenager now.

2060
02:33:47,730 --> 02:33:50,870
So you're like thinking, where the fuck is it heading
towards?

2061
02:33:50,890 --> 02:33:58,090
Like, is it like Shrek dealing with a teenager, like Like,
Shrek is going to be dealing with having a teenage daughter.

2062
02:33:58,330 --> 02:34:01,730
And then I'm, like, I'm a little sketchy about that.

2063
02:34:02,870 --> 02:34:06,210
Just a little sketchy about that part.

2064
02:34:06,370 --> 02:34:13,250
Because I'm like, oh, it's going to be a, like, how do I
handle having a teenage daughter?

2065
02:34:14,330 --> 02:34:14,930
Yeah.

2066
02:34:16,030 --> 02:34:18,790
And, like, have a teenage kid.

2067
02:34:22,170 --> 02:34:23,370
Oh, yeah.

2068
02:34:23,470 --> 02:34:32,090
toy story 5 oh my god okay so they released um they released
like a teaser image of toy story 5 so the plot of toy story

2069
02:34:32,090 --> 02:34:43,010
5 is that um they they're doing like a thing where the the
new kid the new kid gets like a like a fucking e-reader or

2070
02:34:43,010 --> 02:34:48,950
some shit like those kid e-readers like leapfrog e-readers
oh my i used to have a leapfrog i love that shit um it was

2071
02:34:48,950 --> 02:34:51,110
so fun when it, like, it reads stuff out to you and stuff.

2072
02:34:51,410 --> 02:34:56,190
So anyway, it's like a, like a E-toy or some shit, like an
iPad.

2073
02:34:57,090 --> 02:35:00,490
And so like, they're like, the toys are like, what do we do?

2074
02:35:00,810 --> 02:35:05,110
And it was so fucking, it was so funny because, like, Woody
is there.

2075
02:35:05,450 --> 02:35:07,770
And people are like, why the fuck is Woody there?

2076
02:35:08,430 --> 02:35:14,930
They're like, what's the point of, like, Woody leaving the
gang in Toy Story 4.

2077
02:35:15,650 --> 02:35:18,850
And then in Toy Story 5, he's back.

2078
02:35:19,510 --> 02:35:20,890
Why is he back?

2079
02:35:20,950 --> 02:35:23,690
You're like, did you want to explore the world?

2080
02:35:24,270 --> 02:35:27,390
Like, I thought you retired from being a toy.

2081
02:35:27,790 --> 02:35:30,750
And you're going to explore the world with your girlfriend.

2082
02:35:31,850 --> 02:35:34,710
With your, with your, like, girlfriend.

2083
02:35:34,950 --> 02:35:36,210
Why are you back?

02:35:36,570 --> 02:35:36,870
Yeah.

2085
02:35:37,030 --> 02:35:38,330
Yeah, he left the gang.

2086
02:35:39,150 --> 02:35:41,710
He left the gang in Toy Story 4.

2087
02:35:42,550 --> 02:35:49,370
Because he, like, wanted to, like, join the circus and,
like, explore this, I guess, like, travel around.

2088
02:35:49,390 --> 02:35:55,710
America with his girlfriend with Bo Peep and then five they
show a picture of Woody and Buzz together and I'm like

2089
02:35:55,710 --> 02:36:03,970
what's he had an entire arc where he was trying to decide if
he should go he should stay with his like you know stay with

2090
02:36:03,970 --> 02:36:12,850
the toys or like go and um or like explore the explore
America with Bo Peep and he chose Bo Peep and then I'm like

2091
02:36:12,850 --> 02:36:16,090
so why I was like how is he back like

2092
02:36:21,450 --> 02:36:23,050
Bros before bows.

02:36:24,950 --> 02:36:25,990
Bros before bows.

2158
02:44:05,870 --> 02:44:07,530
because i have a dish ralash here

2159
02:44:14,130 --> 02:44:19,610
broken something not sorted i opened something with litter
and didn't put the lid back on no that's how you get mold my

2160
02:44:19,610 --> 02:44:28,190
sir i accidentally forgot to i did do it one time and it was
recently too it was for my sriracha i didn't realize i

2161
02:44:28,190 --> 02:44:38,730
didn't fully close the sriracha like the the the lid thing
it's not even lid it's like you know like a twisting i

2162
02:44:38,730 --> 02:44:51,570
didn't twist it all the way there okay i did it one time i
didn't realize sriracha expires too But I looked at it.

2163
02:44:51,650 --> 02:44:54,330
I was like, why is there like stains on my sriracha bottle?

2164
02:44:54,430 --> 02:44:56,050
And I was like, that has to be mold.

2165
02:44:57,010 --> 02:45:02,070
That was like, I've never seen like this weird ass stain in
my sriracha bottle before.

2166
02:45:02,590 --> 02:45:04,710
And then like, I'm pretty sure it was mold.

2167
02:45:05,930 --> 02:45:07,750
And I instantly threw it away.

2168
02:45:07,830 --> 02:45:10,150
Because I haven't had sriracha in a long ass time.

2169
02:45:10,650 --> 02:45:14,770
Like, like, because like, I never had to use sriracha for a
while.

2170
02:45:15,210 --> 02:45:17,350
So, because I recently, I bought Bulldog Sauce.

2171
02:45:17,430 --> 02:45:18,490
And I just put that on everything.

2172
02:45:19,510 --> 02:45:27,450
like bulldog recently came out with like their own sauces so
like you can actually put bulldog sauce on things so so i

2173
02:45:27,450 --> 02:45:33,250
haven't used sriracha in a long ass time but it's just and
so i've just been using the bulldog sauce like the sauce

2174
02:45:33,250 --> 02:45:38,710
bottles instead because it's like it gives a bigger kick
because i like spicy food so i've just been putting bulldog

2175
02:45:38,710 --> 02:45:44,990
sauce on everything now and um so i never been using my
sriracha so i looked at my sriracha bottle i was like what

2176
02:45:44,990 --> 02:45:46,770
the fuck is that I was like, oh, no.

2177
02:45:47,170 --> 02:45:53,390
And I realized the lid, the twisty screw, the twisty lid was
like not fully twisted tightly.

2178
02:45:53,590 --> 02:45:54,790
So I assumed it was mold.

2179
02:45:57,290 --> 02:45:59,550
So yes, yes, I've done that.

2180
02:45:59,990 --> 02:46:02,930
Chopped vegetable and left described bits on, no, I don't do
that.

2181
02:46:03,050 --> 02:46:03,790
Just throw it out.

2182
02:46:04,130 --> 02:46:06,470
Not taking out food or drink sometimes.

2183
02:46:06,790 --> 02:46:09,150
Only if like I haven't checked the fridge.

2184
02:46:09,490 --> 02:46:11,910
Only if like I've done it for eggs.

2185
02:46:12,070 --> 02:46:13,010
I've done it for eggs.

2186
02:46:13,270 --> 02:46:14,470
Not, that's only, that's it.

crocs and sneakers i'm such a bro i'm such a guy sometimes i

2192
02:47:11,500 --> 02:47:18,380
learn you know like some guys they wear shoes until they're
like broken down and they're like oh i should get new ones i

2193
02:47:18,380 --> 02:47:25,660
literally have you know a shoe for each season crocs sand
like Like, um, sandals and sneakers.

2194
02:47:30,440 --> 02:47:31,900
I should get new sneakers.

2195
02:47:32,060 --> 02:47:32,820
It's been a while.

2196
02:47:32,960 --> 02:47:34,200
They're starting to break down.

2197
02:47:34,940 --> 02:47:36,240
Because, like, if it works, it works.

2198
02:47:36,340 --> 02:47:37,020
I don't care.

2199
02:47:37,440 --> 02:47:41,820
I hated, I hated sneaker shopping with my parents when I
was, like, little.

2200
02:47:42,260 --> 02:47:44,660
Because they would, like, make me test all kinds of
sneakers.

2201
02:47:44,860 --> 02:47:46,000
And I was just, like, I don't care.

2202
02:47:46,080 --> 02:47:47,560
As long as it works, it works.

2203
02:47:47,980 --> 02:47:51,300
And then, like, when I shop by myself, I literally pick a
sneaker out.

2204
02:47:53,040 --> 02:47:59,460
it and that's the note you don't wear it i was like yeah i
was like but then when i was like with my mom she'd be like

2205
02:47:59,460 --> 02:48:07,400
try this and this and this and they're like how do you feel
and then walk around in it oh try this and this and i'm like

2206
02:48:07,400 --> 02:48:17,140
i don't i just i don't care like i i just i don't care as
long as they're new and like it works it's fine and like

2207
02:48:17,140 --> 02:48:24,820
when i go in i hated sneaker shopping with my mom because it
would take like an hour plus because she would like look at

2208
02:48:24,820 --> 02:48:31,440
all the sneakers trying to be like which one is the best one
uh like like in the nikes also she would only buy nikes so

2209
02:48:31,440 --> 02:48:35,980
she'd be like looking at the nike shoes and looking which
one is the best nike shoe because she always only bought

2210
02:48:35,980 --> 02:48:41,740
nikes i also bought nikes because it's like generational so
you know how like if your parents are like nike people then

2211
02:48:41,740 --> 02:48:48,000
you'll only buy nikes so i've never went outside of nikes i
never wore like adida shoes or like puma shoes or anything

2212
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:58,180
i've only worn nike it's like um and then like but then when
i go by choose myself like i literally go in the shop and

2213
02:48:58,180 --> 02:49:04,760
like i can't break the chain you know it's like how my
parents have owned like three weiner dogs like we've owned

2214
02:49:04,760 --> 02:49:16,720

02:49:53,820 --> 02:50:00,480
know if this is an asian thing because i don't know like i
don't know if this is just me or like an asian thing um but

2221
02:50:00,480 --> 02:50:05,480
she would make me like she would bring me like a whole bunch
of clothes she wanted me to try on and then like and then

2222
02:50:05,480 --> 02:50:10,100
like i would have to go into like the changing room i had to
come out of the change room because it's like one person in

2223
02:50:10,100 --> 02:50:18,520
a changing room so then like she'd be like god come on show
me and i have to like come out and she's like and then like

2224
02:50:18,520 --> 02:50:24,860
now turn around now turn left turn right and that go back it
like it's not just okay it's just a mom thing and then like

2225
02:50:24,860 --> 02:50:34,180
she did it all the way till high school so like it was oh
yeah i gotta be like a model for my mom so like she did it

2226
02:50:34,180 --> 02:50:42,560
all the way to like high school so like literally when i
went to college i get i just go in see clothes i like see

2227
02:50:42,560 --> 02:50:52,960
clothes and pants i like don't try them and then i just buy
and then i go home so like in college i just like i see

2228
02:50:52,960 --> 02:50:59,280
paths i was like that's my size and then i just fucking go
home i buy it just go home i don't even try it i fucking

2229
02:50:59,280 --> 02:51:05,960
hate changing rooms now i have like changing room trauma
right because i fucking i hated it because it'd be like

2230
02:51:05,960 --> 02:51:14,140
because like when like when um my mom was like it's close
time yeah like close because like if it doesn't fit return

2231
02:51:14,140 --> 02:51:21,760
it yeah it's if it doesn't fit it doesn't fit so it's not
like like it's not like i can't return it it just saves me

2232
02:51:21,760 --> 02:51:34,340
time so um so like and then like yeah and and then like i
just have to like change your room trauma i guess because

2233
02:51:34,340 --> 02:51:44,260
it's like every time like i would have to like like I don't
even like at that point like um but and then uh and then

2234
02:51:44,260 --> 02:51:51,860
like it basically it was like I it's like pants clothes like
everything and I would go out shred around give her

2235
02:51:51,860 --> 02:52:04,360
different angles and then it's one by one I was just like I
can't do this anymore I can't I can't do this anymore if it

2236
02:52:04,360 --> 02:52:08,620
doesn't that's why when I shop I'm just like If it doesn't
fit, it doesn't fit.

2237
02:52:09,140 --> 02:52:11,500
Like, I don't care.

2238
02:52:16,420 --> 02:52:18,100

finding the right suicide constantly because it's always too

02:55:19,060 --> 02:55:23,840
So I think she bought me a Chanel sneaker when I was in high
school.

2272
02:55:26,140 --> 02:55:29,640
I was like really into shoes in high school, but not like
high heels.

2273
02:55:29,780 --> 02:55:35,060
It was like sneakers and like flatware because they're like
super comfy too.

2274
02:55:35,120 --> 02:55:36,560
I'm trying to remember what it was.

2275
02:55:36,580 --> 02:55:46,340
was called like my favorite brand oh my god i love was it
called saboteur for oh my gosh so okay i'm trying i want to

2276
02:55:46,340 --> 02:55:52,960

know if they're still like they're they're still around they

2277
02:55:52,960 --> 02:56:08,480
have to be still around though i'm zooming in there's like a
little list but um oh echo i fucking love echo echo was one

2278
02:56:08,480 --> 02:56:20,000
of my favorites echo and uh uh salvatore salvatore ferrigamo
they were my favorite shoe brands but like i would just buy

2279
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:27,160
this flats slash sneakers because they were really pretty
but that was like when i was in high school i was like a

2280
02:56:27,160 --> 02:56:31,060
shoe collector Well, not collector.

2281
02:56:31,240 --> 02:56:32,840
I was just really into their shoes.

2282
02:56:37,300 --> 02:56:46,020
No, Echo back then in Asia, in Asia was really popular back
then.

2283
02:56:46,520 --> 02:56:53,500
I don't know about now, but Echo, when I was like, when I
used to live in Asia, especially in China, was super

2284
02:56:53,500 --> 02:56:54,060
popular.

2285
02:57:01,440 --> 02:57:01,720
Yeah.

2286
02:57:02,520 --> 02:57:04,840
I don't know about now, but...

2287
02:57:06,540 --> 02:57:13,520
They were really pop There were like lots of Yeah They were
all the rage back then And they were really pretty too Like

2288
02:57:13,520 --> 02:57:22,340
I like the ones where it had like I don't know They were
really comfy They were really comfy And they were like They

2289
02:57:22,340 --> 02:57:33,920
were really pretty But now I don't care Now I have three
pairs of shoes Yeah Now I only have three pairs I don't care

2290
02:57:33,920 --> 02:57:45,160
no more because like wearing nice shoes require you to go
outside and i don't go outside as much anymore i oh my god

2291
02:57:45,160 --> 02:57:53,280
yeah i think i told you guys i almost i almost i remember i
made an off comment about it um and like i think it was like

2292
02:57:53,280 --> 02:57:58,660
during the apex stream but like they invited me to the
streamer awards and like i was like oh if i go in kainito

2293
02:57:58,660 --> 02:58:04,840
it's fun right and then like i actually almost went because
i was like i'm not nominated so like there's no cameras on

2294
02:58:04,860 --> 02:58:11,920
me but then i found out that the seating list was fucking
public and i was like are you fucking like and then i was

2295
02:58:11,920 --> 02:58:21,960
like i'm not going yeah yeah because like people it wasn't
it wasn't public but it wasn't public but like um all the

2296
02:58:21,960 --> 02:58:28,160
streamers were showing the seating list and everything
because it was like uh they're like it was online so like

2297
02:58:28,160 --> 02:58:34,400
yeah so it was online and then like the streamers like all
the big streamers were literally showing the seating list

2298
02:58:34,400 --> 02:58:36,860
and stuff like Oh, these people are sitting there.

2299
02:58:37,180 --> 02:58:38,480
These people are sitting there.

2300
02:58:38,760 --> 02:58:41,380
So then I was like, okay, I'm not going.

2301
02:58:42,100 --> 02:58:47,020
Like, if they see, like, Doki Bird, then, like, people
would, like, try and look at the cameras and stuff.

2302
02:58:47,080 --> 02:58:48,040
Be like, where's Doki Bird?

2303
02:58:48,880 --> 02:58:49,180
Yeah.

2304
02:58:51,100 --> 02:58:54,460
It was a free ticket, like, like, and I could, like, yeah.

2305
02:58:54,920 --> 02:58:58,380
So that's why, like, I was just like, bro, that's, like, not
safe for me.

2306
02:59:02,500 --> 02:59:04,640
That's, like, whoever's on my table.

2307
02:59:04,860 --> 02:59:10,940
with like if they're streaming and there's a lot of people
were doing rl streams too so whoever was on my table they

2308
02:59:10,940 --> 02:59:15,640
would have like if i happened to i didn't see the seeing
list because by the time it was finalized i already dropped

2309
02:59:15,640 --> 02:59:24,840
out um i already dropped out for it um so that's why like i
didn't go because i'm a very private person so so like

2310
02:59:24,840 --> 02:59:30,400
because the seeing list wasn't supposed to be public per se
it's just like other streamers were just showing the seating

2311
02:59:30,400 --> 02:59:38,380
list on stream and stuff and it was just highlighting who
was sitting with who yeah so that's why like i i was just

2312
02:59:38,380 --> 02:59:42,620
like i wanted i was like i thought it was really fun because
i never been in an event like that before and i thought i

2313
02:59:42,620 --> 02:59:48,780
could just go incognito because i was like oh i'm not
nominated for anything so if i'm not nominated for anything

2314
02:59:48,780 --> 02:59:55,120
the camera won't be on me like specifically like dodge
donkey bird like you know like you know donkey bird

2315
02:59:55,120 --> 03:00:01,140
dominated for this so i was like okay i could i thought it
would be a really cool experience because i was just like oh

2316
03:00:01,140 --> 03:00:07,020
like i've never done this like i never gone to i just wanted
to like You know, just wanted to be there just for, like,

2317
03:00:07,060 --> 03:00:07,700
the experience.

2318
03:00:07,840 --> 03:00:10,200
But then, like, I just felt like, oh, I don't really want...

2319
03:00:10,200 --> 03:00:11,940
I was really worried about being on camera.

2320
03:00:13,400 --> 03:00:16,100
I was really, like, scared about it.

2321
03:00:18,320 --> 03:00:19,300
So I didn't go.

2322
03:00:19,720 --> 03:00:25,180
I thought I was, like, I was, like, excited for it, too,
because I just wanted to, like, I wanted to just experience

2323
03:00:25,180 --> 03:00:26,300
what it's like to be in one...

2324
03:00:26,300 --> 03:00:28,920
Like, just to enjoy these events just for fun.

2325
03:00:29,280 --> 03:00:30,500
Not for, like, any...

2326
03:00:30,500 --> 03:00:34,500
Like, just for fun and just, like, talk to people, you know,
interact with people and stuff.

2327
03:00:36,500 --> 03:00:43,760
like so the but i was just like i just felt scared i was
just like oh like my privacy and stuff i meant you're like

2328
03:00:43,760 --> 03:00:49,040
oh you're a streamer you shouldn't you should like but it's
like you know there's an excuse where you're like oh but

2329
03:00:49,040 --> 03:00:57,180
you're a streamer like streamers don't have privacy you know
but like but like that's why i wanted to be a vtuber because

2330
03:00:57,180 --> 03:01:09,400
i get to enjoy the luxury of my privacy while being able to
stream you know because like, you know, a lot of these other

2331
03:01:09,400 --> 03:01:14,340
content creators especially FletchTubers, everything is like
put online, like everything, everything about them.

2332
03:01:14,500 --> 03:01:20,660
So to them, they're like to them, it doesn't really matter
to them because their entire lives are practically online.

2333
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:27,180
But I have a huge separation between online, my public
online persona and my private life as well.

2334
03:01:27,540 --> 03:01:33,100
So like I have the luxury of having a private life outside
of streaming.

2335
03:01:33,620 --> 03:01:38,700
And I don't have to worry about stuff like that by pursuing
VTubing.

2336
03:01:39,180 --> 03:01:45,620
And that's why I don't do like IRL appearances or like stuff
like that, because I like having privacy.

2337
03:01:46,560 --> 03:01:47,060
I don't know.

2338
03:01:47,620 --> 03:01:55,300
I personally like having a life outside, like going to
places without having to like worry about being like stream

2339
03:01:55,300 --> 03:02:01,760
sniped or like, that's like one of the things I worry the
most is just like, going outside and being recognized and

2340
03:02:01,760 --> 03:02:02,360
stuff like that.

2341
03:02:02,460 --> 03:02:08,960
And I don't have to have that fear of that in general,
because I know like I'm very private about myself.

2342
03:02:09,160 --> 03:02:14,300
So I can actually go outside and not having to worry about
things like that.

2343
03:02:14,700 --> 03:02:22,600
And having to like, like, you see like clips of like big
streamers getting harassed in public and things.

2344
03:02:22,720 --> 03:02:23,980
And I don't want to deal with that.

2345
03:02:24,080 --> 03:02:30,580
So that's why I like V-Tuning and I very private about like,
you know, separating like flesh like you know there's like

2346
03:02:30,580 --> 03:02:38,260
vtubers who do like flesh tubing and also like being a
vtuber um but for me i like the separation because i like

2347
03:02:38,260 --> 03:02:47,720
having a i like having a life outside of social media and
content creation and it's nice it's really nice and that's

2348
03:02:47,720 --> 03:02:51,800
why i really wanted to go to the streamer event because i
was just like oh i never got a status experience that before

2349
03:02:51,800 --> 03:03:00,260
but i realized like if i go there like you know my identity
will be basically exposed to the public so So I was just

2350
03:03:00,260 --> 03:03:01,680
like, oh, fuck, okay.

2351
03:03:01,780 --> 03:03:05,100
Because I couldn't pretend to be, like, just an Asian girl
here.

2352
03:03:09,160 --> 03:03:10,120
Just like, yeah.

2353
03:03:10,300 --> 03:03:13,980
So it's just like, you know, just be like this random plus
one Asian girl.

2354
03:03:14,240 --> 03:03:17,080
But I can't because the seating arrangement was out.

2355
03:03:17,920 --> 03:03:19,600
Like, yeah.

2356
03:03:21,240 --> 03:03:27,280
Face masks doesn't, I don't think like, I don't, I know like
someone will just put a face mask.

2357
03:03:27,500 --> 03:03:29,680
But it doesn't really matter because your top part.

2358
03:03:29,700 --> 03:03:31,880
You get the eyes, too.

2359
03:03:33,120 --> 03:03:34,580
It's like the eyes and stuff.

2360
03:03:36,200 --> 03:03:40,160
I don't think, like, face mask works as well as you guys
think.

2361
03:03:42,020 --> 03:03:45,540
Because the eyes are the most recognizable part of a person.

2362
03:03:50,530 --> 03:03:53,430
I guess you can wear glasses, but then you're like, that's a
V-tuber.

2363
03:03:53,550 --> 03:04:01,190
Okay, but then, like, the thing is, when you wear face mask
and glasses, everyone was like, that's the V-tuber.

2364
03:04:02,590 --> 03:04:04,530
So it's also that, too.

2365
03:04:04,790 --> 03:04:08,910
Like, I remember watching the streamer once, I was like, I
could tell which one's the V-Tuber.

2366
03:04:09,910 --> 03:04:14,150
Because they're the ones that are wearing the face mask and
the sunglasses.

2367
03:04:14,530 --> 03:04:17,650
So you're like, that's the V-Tuber over there.

2368
03:04:17,770 --> 03:04:19,670
It's trying to hide their identity.

2369
03:04:20,170 --> 03:04:23,070
So I don't want to deal with that, too.

2370
03:04:23,470 --> 03:04:23,750
Yeah.

2371
03:04:23,930 --> 03:04:26,430
Because no one else is wearing it.

2372
03:04:28,530 --> 03:04:30,130
Did you see the V-Tuber?

2373
03:04:30,270 --> 03:04:30,990
Did you see it?

2374
03:04:38,130 --> 03:04:46,030
That's why when I went to China for the Marvel Rivals Land,
I was just chilling because I was like an Asian in the sea

2375
03:04:46,030 --> 03:04:46,910
of Asians.

2376
03:04:48,130 --> 03:04:50,950
I was just like, I didn't even wear a face mask or anything.

2377
03:04:51,150 --> 03:04:56,290
I was just like, I was just like, I mean, I had to wear face
masks later on because I started to get a little sick.

2378
03:04:57,230 --> 03:05:00,570
I started getting sick, so I had to wear a face mask later
on.

2379
03:05:00,650 --> 03:05:06,130
But like, it was really hiding in like plain sight when I
was like in China.

2380
03:05:10,160 --> 03:05:15,920
yeah when i was like in china for the marvel rivals land and
then there was like other streamers there and everything and

2381
03:05:15,920 --> 03:05:22,080
then like they didn't know i was there and i was there
because like they just thought i was this part of the staff

2382
03:05:22,080 --> 03:05:23,680
team when i was hanging out with the staff

2383
03:05:29,100 --> 03:05:34,700
yeah they just thought i was like part of the staff team
because i was speaking in chinese too like to them like when

2384
03:05:34,700 --> 03:05:42,920
i was talking to the staff during the marvel rivals rivals
land i was instead of english no when you speak in chinese

2385
03:05:42,920 --> 03:05:49,180
like when you speak in different languages your tone is
different in general i don't know for anyone else who are

2386
03:05:49,180 --> 03:05:56,020
who know more than one language but like when you have when
you speak a different language um you you're the way you

2387
03:05:56,020 --> 03:06:01,640
speak and your tone changes as well because i know when i
speak in chinese my tone gets deeper

2388
03:06:04,820 --> 03:06:07,720
next see thank you for the super chat thank you thank you

2389
03:06:11,020 --> 03:06:13,360
Doki Berky-Gi-Gi-Gi with the anime face mask.

2390
03:06:13,540 --> 03:06:15,760
They'll know it's you, but they won't know what you're
looking like.

2391
03:06:16,000 --> 03:06:17,260
Thank you for the super chat.

Yeah.

2395
03:06:26,470 --> 03:06:29,430
Yeah, I sound really different when I speak in Chinese.

2396
03:06:32,370 --> 03:06:34,030
Alright, let's go back to the quiz.

2397
03:06:34,230 --> 03:06:36,190

Buzzfeed's still.

2400
03:06:38,110 --> 03:06:43,490
No matter how many years passed, Buzzfeed will still suck
your soul dry.

It's just an empty toilet roll.

But I wouldn't leave it on the toilet roll holder.

2409

Been told off of work for having a messy desk.

Okay, none of these matter to me because I'm my own boss.

2438
03:10:50,260 --> 03:10:50,540
I don't.

2439
03:10:52,320 --> 03:10:53,180
That's right.

2440
03:10:53,400 --> 03:10:54,920
Cat, tell myself off.

2441
03:10:57,300 --> 03:10:58,340
Hover, rude.

2442
03:10:58,500 --> 03:11:00,360
Wait, hoovered around things?

2443
03:11:00,420 --> 03:11:01,480
I don't know what that means.

2444
03:11:01,940 --> 03:11:04,720
Not bothered to hoover, I won't pick a large, noticeable
item.

2445
03:11:04,980 --> 03:11:06,880
What the fuck is a hoover?

2446
03:11:07,620 --> 03:11:09,520
Are these the mini vacuums?

2447
03:11:10,380 --> 03:11:11,500
Is that what it is?

2448
03:11:12,560 --> 03:11:14,440
Treated a table like a shelf?

2449
03:11:15,140 --> 03:11:15,580
Oh!

2450
03:11:17,560 --> 03:11:19,800

don't do that.

2455
03:11:29,380 --> 03:11:34,080
I think, I'm sorry, for anyone that eats in bed, you don't
eat where you sleep.

2456
03:11:34,260 --> 03:11:36,320
I, I think that's pretty gross.

2457
03:11:36,500 --> 03:11:37,860
I would eat where I work.

2458
03:11:37,940 --> 03:11:42,000
I would eat at the table, but I would not, it's also like
not convenient at all.

2459
03:11:42,320 --> 03:11:45,180
Like, it's like, cause I need a table, you know?

2460
03:11:45,540 --> 03:11:51,720
So it's like, it's like, it's like, where do I put my food,
you know?

2461
03:11:53,680 --> 03:11:54,140
Yeah.

2462
03:11:54,140 --> 03:11:55,720
Don't eat where you sleep.

2463
03:11:58,890 --> 03:12:03,090
I just I need, like, a table to put my food down.

2464
03:12:03,810 --> 03:12:05,070
Treat a table like a shelf.

2465
03:12:05,170 --> 03:12:07,430
I mean, yeah, I put stuff around my table.

2466
03:12:08,870 --> 03:12:09,810
Okay, no.

2467
03:12:11,070 --> 03:12:11,410
No.

2468
03:12:12,070 --> 03:12:14,770
Have your mates sigh at you.

03:13:19,330 --> 03:13:22,790
Need some rat rainbow foods to find out.

Alright.

2489
03:13:25,530 --> 03:13:26,810

03:13:29,050 --> 03:13:29,630
I...

2492
03:13:29,790 --> 03:13:32,590
Tom yum soup is so fucking good.

03:13:37,390 --> 03:13:39,510
Oh, I fucking love salmon.

Fuck.

2497
03:13:41,030 --> 03:13:42,510
Give me, I like, okay, well, I was sick.

2498
03:13:42,750 --> 03:13:49,290
Literally, I had salmon two days in a row because salmon is
really good for your, like, for your body when you're sick.

2499
03:13:50,450 --> 03:13:52,730
So I literally was eating salmon three days in a row.

2500
03:13:52,830 --> 03:13:55,190
I even ate salmon today, but I ate, like, sushi.

2501
03:13:55,530 --> 03:13:57,490
Like, I Googled, is sushi okay for you?

2502
03:13:57,550 --> 03:14:01,850
And then Google said, no, because raw fish is not good for
you when you're sick but i was like i'm not gonna listen to

2503
03:14:01,850 --> 03:14:13,750
google i i'm gonna choose to ignore that because it's still
salmon it's i was like i choose to ignore when it doesn't

2504
03:14:13,750 --> 03:14:18,810
fit when it doesn't fit my my plans

2505
03:14:22,450 --> 03:14:31,690
ravioli because i love pasta i decided mangoes are ravioli
but i love ravioli more Where it doesn't fit my agenda, I

2506
03:14:31,690 --> 03:14:32,570
choose to ignore.

2507
03:14:36,330 --> 03:14:37,190
No, I wasn't the AI.

2508
03:14:37,470 --> 03:14:39,190
I was like, I don't, I don't look at AI.

2509
03:14:39,330 --> 03:14:40,950
I always like double check from below.

2510
03:14:41,230 --> 03:14:42,930
But even they were like, even they were like, don't do it.

2511
03:14:43,010 --> 03:14:46,170
And I was like, I choose, if it doesn't fit my agenda, then
it doesn't exist.

2512
03:14:48,230 --> 03:14:48,910
Pesto pasta.

2513
03:14:51,110 --> 03:14:52,730
Well, I'm such a- Rainbow Dash!

2514
03:14:53,470 --> 03:14:55,470
Okay, that- okay, that's actually perfect.

2515
03:14:55,630 --> 03:14:56,890
I'm definitely Rainbow Dash.

2516
03:14:57,450 --> 03:14:59,730
Oh my- I love- I'm such a child.

2517
03:15:01,190 --> 03:15:13,750
are bubble plum and cotton candy yeah rainbow dash I you
know like the voice actors um it's it's like oh it's like

2518
03:15:13,750 --> 03:15:21,110
kpop demon hunters but the sick usually the singers for my
little pony aren't even the actual voice actors it's like

2519
03:15:21,110 --> 03:15:26,610
someone else like I don't like the sunset shimmer voice
actress it's actually the singing voice of Twilight Sparkle

2520
03:15:26,610 --> 03:15:32,270
because what's her name I forgot the The girl who does
Twilight Sparkle's voice acting, she doesn't sing.

2521
03:15:33,150 --> 03:15:38,070
But a lot, yeah, a lot of the voice actors by The Pony don't
sing their own songs.

2522
03:15:38,950 --> 03:15:42,210
That's usually how it goes, because sometimes it's hard to
sing in those voices.

2523
03:15:43,810 --> 03:15:44,850
It's like K-pop Demon Hunters.

2524
03:15:45,010 --> 03:15:46,650
I feel so bad for the...

2525
03:15:46,650 --> 03:15:47,270
Yeah, Taka Straw.

2526
03:15:47,510 --> 03:15:50,630
I feel so bad for the main voice actor.

2527
03:15:53,190 --> 03:15:53,630
Um...

2528
03:15:54,990 --> 03:15:58,770
I feel so bad for the main voice actors for K-pop Demon
Hunters.

2529
03:15:58,790 --> 03:16:06,530
hunters because like because like everyone's talking about
the the singers of kpop demon hunters because like you know

2530
03:16:06,530 --> 03:16:11,770
like it's like the singers of kpop demon hunters are
different from the actual voices from the like they're both

2531
03:16:11,770 --> 03:16:19,710
i mean from the voice actors who voiced the characters from
kpop demon hunters and it's like but like the only people

2532
03:16:19,710 --> 03:16:26,090
the singers are the only ones getting publicities and all
the interviews all the interviews all the performances and

2533
03:16:26,090 --> 03:16:31,990
everything You rarely ever see, like, the voice actors for
K-pop Demon Hunters doing interviews or publicity stuff.

2534
03:16:32,250 --> 03:16:32,310
Yeah.

2535
03:16:36,450 --> 03:16:38,130
I feel so bad for them.

2536
03:16:38,710 --> 03:16:42,510
Because it's literally, like, the only time they were
like...

2537
03:16:42,510 --> 03:16:45,650
I think the only time they were there was for the Critics'
Choice Awards.

2538
03:16:47,570 --> 03:16:48,030
Yeah.

2539
03:16:48,250 --> 03:16:51,810
I mean, it makes sense because, you know, the songs are the
main attractions.

2540
03:16:52,130 --> 03:16:53,350
But I just feel bad for them.

2541
03:16:53,610 --> 03:16:54,390
Because, like...

2542
03:16:56,530 --> 03:16:58,890
Because they were also, they're also, like, well-known.

2543
03:16:58,970 --> 03:17:08,910
like there are also well-known actors actresses too it's
just rough because like literally all the interviews every

2544
03:17:08,910 --> 03:17:13,930
single interview for kpop demon hunters are literally the
singers and not the voice actors even though the voice

2545
03:17:13,930 --> 03:17:17,030
actors also helped build the characters for them

2546
03:17:23,740 --> 03:17:34,840

2637
03:22:24,030 --> 03:22:25,810
I'm just here for, like, fun experience.

2638
03:22:25,930 --> 03:22:29,190
I think this is just, I guess this, oh, is this the Las
Vegas strip?

2639
03:22:29,310 --> 03:22:30,510
Because it's, like, in Nevada.

2641
03:22:32,210 --> 03:22:34,090
I don't care about gambling.

2642
03:22:35,070 --> 03:22:40,010
Because I know it'd be, well, the thing is, I've never
actually gambled before in real life, like, casinos or

2643
03:22:40,010 --> 03:22:40,390
whatever.

2644
03:22:40,810 --> 03:22:44,250
Because I was never of, like, legal age for it.

2645
03:22:44,270 --> 03:22:52,030
So I feel like I have very addicting personality and I feel
like if I do gamble, it's over for me So so I don't want to

2686
03:26:10,280 --> 03:26:11,440
I got a hamster.

2687
03:26:12,220 --> 03:26:14,200
It's not even a dog.

2688
03:26:14,720 --> 03:26:16,060
What the fuck?

2689
03:26:16,420 --> 03:26:18,820
It's not a hamster.

2690
03:26:23,520 --> 03:26:25,000
You're a quirky and friendly.

2691
03:26:25,020 --> 03:26:27,120
And then the hamster again.

2692
03:26:27,560 --> 03:26:29,100
Another hamster?

2693
03:26:29,800 --> 03:26:30,360

2694
03:26:32,100 --> 03:26:33,940
Okay, I guess I'm a hamster.

2695
03:26:34,220 --> 03:26:35,400
I don't want to own a hamster.

2696
03:26:35,960 --> 03:26:37,140
These guys are...

2697
03:26:37,140 --> 03:26:38,320
They're like...

2698
03:26:38,320 --> 03:26:40,340
Like, they will...

2699
03:26:40,340 --> 03:26:41,640
They, like, you know...

2700
03:26:41,640 --> 03:26:43,260
They eat their babies and shit.

2701
03:26:44,420 --> 03:26:46,240
I'm, like, worried about that.

2702
03:26:47,680 --> 03:26:49,280
And they really...

2703
03:26:49,280 --> 03:26:50,100
If you don't...

2704
03:26:50,100 --> 03:26:52,920
If you're not careful, they're going to make a lot of
babies, too.

2705
03:26:52,920 --> 03:26:58,600
They're going to make a lot of babies if you're not careful.

2706
03:27:01,060 --> 03:27:06,700
I'm not going to do the transformer one because I will
purposely pick to be a Decepticon because I fucking hate the

2707
03:27:06,700 --> 03:27:07,340
Autobots.

2708
03:27:07,760 --> 03:27:09,540
I think the Decepticons are cooler.

2709
03:27:11,080 --> 03:27:18,540
And I would, like, subconsciously pick, um, pick, like, uh,
pick for, like, a Decepticon pick.

2887
03:41:35,600 --> 03:41:38,080
But there was some fucked up quizzes they have.

2888
03:41:38,280 --> 03:41:40,100
Yeah, I don't want to mention it.

2889
03:41:40,400 --> 03:41:43,840
But it was like a really, it was a really funny one.

2890
03:41:45,480 --> 03:41:48,000
because it's pretty messed up.

2891
03:41:49,620 --> 03:41:54,860
It was like in the, it was like, I'll Google like top
funniest BuzzFeed quizzes.

2892
03:41:55,600 --> 03:42:00,280
And like, it was like, and then like that was one of the
choices.

2893
03:42:00,820 --> 03:42:08,940
I would say like, and I looked at the quiz and it was like,
and okay, the questions were, some of the questions there

2894
03:42:08,940 --> 03:42:12,520
was pretty funny, but like I couldn't do it on stream.

2895
03:42:12,700 --> 03:42:14,360

2896
03:42:23,090 --> 03:42:24,950
Which Disney villain are you?

2897
03:42:25,210 --> 03:42:26,010
Okay, I'll do that one.

2898
03:42:27,550 --> 03:42:31,490
Funny how it was in the Reddit thread for funniest BuzzFeed
quizzes.

2899
03:42:31,750 --> 03:42:37,730
And I looked it because it was like, it was in the category
of like, it was listed within like, which Illuminati member

2900
03:42:37,730 --> 03:42:38,310
are you?

2901
03:42:39,270 --> 03:42:43,110
But like, there was another top, there was another quiz that
the same person gave.

2902
03:42:43,490 --> 03:42:49,030
I was like, it was okay, I'll say it was like, what's what,
like the two, they gave three choices.

2903
03:42:50,870 --> 03:42:51,350
potato.

2904
03:42:52,030 --> 03:42:55,350
The other one was, which Illuminati member are you?

2905
03:42:55,410 --> 03:42:58,470
I wanted to do that one, but then I looked at it, and then
it was God.

2906
03:42:58,590 --> 03:42:59,870
And then there was the third quiz.

2907
03:43:00,050 --> 03:43:07,190
And that was the quiz where I looked, I clicked on it, and
then I looked at the questions, and like the first question

2908
03:43:07,190 --> 03:43:08,990
was fucking so funny.

2909
03:43:09,510 --> 03:43:13,250
And then I was like, I cannot do this quiz.

2910
03:43:18,580 --> 03:43:21,240
So that might give you a hint.

2911
03:43:22,240 --> 03:43:23,140

2912
03:43:23,880 --> 03:43:25,420
Gave you the biggest hint.

03:43:25,820 --> 03:43:27,780
This person listed three quizzes.

2914
03:43:29,180 --> 03:43:30,960
They listed three quizzes.

2915
03:43:31,280 --> 03:43:33,140
One was, what is your inner potato?

2916
03:43:33,780 --> 03:43:38,060
The second one was, what, okay, the third, second one was
that other quiz.

2917
03:43:38,160 --> 03:43:44,020
The third one was, what is your, what is your inner, like,
what Illuminati member are you?

It's so fucking funny, but I can't do.

2921
03:43:53,240 --> 03:43:57,480
No, it's not the inner, I didn't list the third, this third
quiz.

03:44:05,720 --> 03:44:11,680
Being manipulative, being sinister, being vain.

2925
03:44:12,000 --> 03:44:14,160
