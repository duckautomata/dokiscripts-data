00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,600
Hello, everyone!

2
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,240
Let's hear some cheers!

3
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,820
Hello, everyone!

4
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:46,900
Hello, everyone!

5
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,280
Hello, all the Dragoons!

6
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,520
Who are we here to see today?

7
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,640
We are here to see...

8
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:51,700
Wow!

9
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,800
I know you've been waiting for a long time.

10
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,580
I won't say too much.

11
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,400
Let's say her name again.

12
00:01:59,280 --> 00:01:59,740
Hello,

13
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:07,390
everyone!

14
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,970
We are here in Hong Kong!

15
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:09,130
Hello, everyone!

16
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,390
Hello, Doki!

17
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,930
Welcome to Hong Kong ACG!

18
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,630
Hello, welcome to Hong Kong ACG!

19
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,270
Oh my god!

20
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,410
I'm so happy to be here.

21
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,370
Yeah, I am!

22
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:27,170
It's like 3.30 a.m., but yeah, I am.

23
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:36,510
I choked down a can of coffee before I got here because it's 3.30 in the morning.

24
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:38,950
We love the dessert!

25
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,890
Did you see your fans over there?

26
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:41,710
The Dragoons?

27
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,590
Make some noise, guys!

28
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,190
There are so many!

29
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,210
There are so many Hong Kong Dragoons!

30
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,650
There are lots of people.

31
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:53,350
Half of the venue's people are over here for meeting you, actually.

32
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:54,910
So...

33
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,190
I can't hear you.

34
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:57,510
Why is the mic muted?

35
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,650
Why is the mic muted?

36
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,730
I don't know what the MC said.

37
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:08,010
Can you hear me right now?

38
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:09,650
I can hear you.

39
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,750
You want me to speak English on Cantonese?

40
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:14,670
I can do both.

41
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:19,430
I'm going to do both because my Cantonese level is like a third grade level.

42
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:24,190
So I will speak English and some Cantonese.

43
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:25,930
Okay, good.

44
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:27,010
I can hear you.

45
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,190
No problem.

46
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:34,150
Actually, I'm telling you that half of the venue's people over here are meeting you.

47
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,210
What do you think for HKACG in this event?

48
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:38,950
Is this your first time?

49
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:43,670
Well, I went to the ACGHK when I was young.

50
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,730
It was my first convention when I was young.

51
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,410
I was very happy.

52
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,830
I didn't even think I would be a guest here.

53
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,730
The first time was a guest.

54
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,370
Okay, so...

55
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:03,250
Actually, I want to ask all of you what is Doki's best at?

56
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,470
What is Doki's best at?

57
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,350
Can you hear me?

58
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:07,130
Yes!

59
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:10,450
Okay, so...

60
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,210
What are we going to do next, Doki?

61
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:13,870
What are we going to do next, Doki?

62
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:18,950
Oh, so we're going to be playing a little bit of Apex today.

63
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:22,650
Some of the draggoons are very lucky to play with me.

64
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:29,550
Yes, some lovely draggers have a chance to play with you today.

65
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,190
So, we're going to play Apex with Doki today.

66
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:38,050
We saw the three of us who bought the bundle.

67
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:39,930
We're going to play with the friends who are in the lead.

68
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,230
Let's play from the first round.

69
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,330
Pick your draggons.

70
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,530
Who wants to play with me?

71
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:50,650
Who is good?

72
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,010
Who is good?

73
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:54,870
Who knows how to play?

74
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:02,050
Okay, those who picked by Doki, at least five hero names.

75
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,890
Okay, at least five hero names.

76
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,610
Okay, I saw the first one.

77
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,950
The first one was raised her hand.

78
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,450
There's one guy with a rabbit hair over there.

79
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,390
Over there?

80
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,450
Yeah, that guy.

81
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:17,810
Okay, him.

82
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,910
And one more.

83
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,670
You want girl?

84
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,190
I saw a very pretty lady over here.

85
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,910
She's dressed like a young...

86
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,230
Okay.

87
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,250
Let's give them a round of applause.

88
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,550
Actually, they came to this stage because they were very nervous.

89
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,870
I saw so many people.

90
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:37,510
I'm very nervous.

91
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,630
I'm nervous too.

92
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:40,930
I'll play the Hong Kong Pink.

93
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:41,530
I don't know.

94
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,210
The Hong Kong Pink is over 200.

95
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,470
I just saw it.

96
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,830
Let me pick up a pretty coser.

97
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,430
Give her a round of applause.

98
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,450
You'll carry me, right?

99
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,190
You're in Hong Kong.

100
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,310
You'll carry me.

101
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,270
Let me do a little bit of interview.

102
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,510
What's your name?

103
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,270
Her name is Zi Mao Yuan.

104
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,150
I don't know how to translate in English.

105
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,330
Is Mao Mao?

106
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,090
Nicco Maloo.

107
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,830
The girl's name is Nicco Maloo.

108
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,590
Oh, Mao Mao.

109
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:19,950
Yes, Mao Mao.

110
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:20,650
What's your name?

111
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,670
Thomas.

112
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,770
Let's give Thomas a round of applause.

113
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:27,710
Thomas, have you played Apex before?

114
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,250
How long have you played Apex?

115
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:31,470
I've been playing for a while.

116
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:38,490
Are you confident that you won't You're very confident that you won't get caught.

117
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:39,970
You won't get caught!

118
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:40,870
I won't save you.

119
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:44,950
You're confident, right?

120
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,050
Yes, I am.

121
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:46,750
I'm very tired.

122
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,210
Why is that?

123
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,750
I know Thomas will carry you.

124
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:50,690
Because he said he won't get caught.

125
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,830
Thomas will carry us.

126
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,050
Let Thomas carry us.

127
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,330
They believe you will carry them, right?

128
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,110
Yeah, I believe.

129
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:01,810
If he dies, I won't raise him.

130
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,870
Let's start the game.

131
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:06,950
Alright, alright.

132
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,870
Let me add them.

133
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,130
I'm going to add them.

134
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,050
Alright, are you guys ready?

135
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,830
Actually, let's take a picture with you right now.

136
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,370
You guys are even in my lobby.

137
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,110
Oh, I want Apex.

138
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,000
Caustic?

139
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:34,820
Okay.

140
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:35,700
Oh.

141
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,120
I'll save you guys.

142
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,000
I'll do lifeline.

143
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,020
If you guys die, I can save you guys.

144
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,940
Do you know what I was playing just now?

145
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,380
I was playing Overwatch, not Apex.

146
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,620
I don't know if I can do it.

147
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,360
I was playing Overwatch just now.

148
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,940
Thomas, Thomas promised to carry everyone.

149
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:03,720
No worries, Doki.

150
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,400
Okay, no, okay, good, good.

151
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,460
I don't need to shoot.

152
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,160
Thomas can do it.

153
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,600
I don't need to shoot?

154
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:09,960
Okay.

155
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,260
I'll feed Thomas all the ammo.

156
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,360
You can give it to Thomas.

157
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,100
Okay, Thomas, who are you?

158
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,960
It's your turn, Thomas.

159
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,580
Thomas, you're Valkyrie or Caustic?

160
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,180
Who are you?

161
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,060
Oh, they can't hear the mic.

162
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,440
Can't they hear it?

163
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:30,840
They can't hear it.

164
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,040
They can't hear it.

165
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,740
Okay, you can start.

166
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,140
He's Caustic, I'm Valkyrie.

167
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,860
Thomas is now.

168
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,520
Oh, Loba?

169
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:51,900
Rave?

170
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,700
Thomas is definitely Rave.

171
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,780
Definitely him.

172
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,250
He's Valkyrie.

173
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,770
He's Valkyrie, no, he's Rave.

174
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:05,650
Right?

175
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,630
Okay, fighting.

176
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,270
Alright, Thomas.

177
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,910
If you die, you're bad.

178
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:17,530
If you die, you're bad.

179
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:20,430
Whoever dies first is the worst player.

180
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:22,930
Whoever dies first is the worst player.

181
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,630
Oh, shit, that's a lot of people.

182
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:26,530
Okay.

183
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,170
Alright.

184
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:30,510
Thomas, Lila, who be now?

185
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:30,830
Thomas.

186
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:35,300

266
00:11:58,610 --> 00:11:59,810
Thomas, you're doing Healer.

267
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:00,730
You can't do it.

268
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:03,710
I'll ask Thomas again.

269
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:04,210

Okay, just go.

275

374
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,710
Alright, yeah, front row, that guy.

375
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:19,410
This guy?

376
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,310
That guy over there.

377
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:20,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

378
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,130
How many years have you played Apex?

379
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,070
Let me choose for you.

380
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:23,770
Let me choose for you.

381
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,110
Can you name actually five heroes?

382
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:25,710
Three years?

383
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:26,530
Three years?

384
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,450
Five heroes?

385
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:28,370
Can you name them?

386
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:31,870
Okay, let's go.

387
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,650
Name five legends.

388
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,650
Yeah, I'll help you pick some.

389
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:38,030
Then you help me pick.

390
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,710
Let me choose any girls.

391
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,170
Any girls?

392
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:41,710
Like...

393
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,150
Hello?

394
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:43,950
Hello?

395
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:44,530
Where are you from?

396
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,190
Where are you from?

397
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:46,430
Oh, no, actually.

398
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:46,870
Oh, no, actually.

399
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,570
How many years have you played Apex?

400
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:49,230
How many years have you played Apex?

401
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,530
Three, you think?

402
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:52,990
Three, you think?

403
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,270
Can you carry doggies?

404
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,130
What's your rank?

405
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:57,350
I didn't...

406
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:00,450
Okay, do you want to try?

407
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:01,050
Okay, do you want to try?

408
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:01,990
Okay, sure.

409
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:02,650
Okay, sure.

410
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:03,350
Okay.

411
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:03,950
Let's come up here.

412
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:04,570
Come up here.

413
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,670
Give some applause to the two of you.

414
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:07,370
Give some applause to the two of you.

415
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:08,250
Yeah!

416
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,310
Okay, let me ask you a question.

417
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:10,690
This is a very interesting question.

418
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:11,650
Are you Thomas?

419
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,330
Yes, I am Thomas.

420
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:14,590
I am Thomas.

421
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,310
Poor Thomas.

422
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:15,710
I am Jason.

423
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,530
His name is Jason.

424
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:18,710
Jason.

425
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,030
Okay, give some...

426
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:20,910
Give some applause to Jason.

427
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:21,970
Okay.

428
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:22,410
Yeah!

429
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:23,830
Jason.

430
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:24,530
Hi.

431
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,430
Please be seated.

432
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:25,730
Hi.

433
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:26,070
Please be seated.

434
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:27,870
Okay.

435
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:28,570
Okay.

436
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:31,710
Put your luggage under the seat and fasten your seat belt.

437
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:32,470
Fasten your seat belt.

438
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:35,410
Okay, may I know your name?

439
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,070
May I know your name?

440
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:36,430
Ryder.

441
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:37,550
Ryder.

442
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,670
Oh, his name is Ryder.

443
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:39,450
Can you speak Cantonese?

444
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:40,150
Can you speak Cantonese?

445
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,290
What's your rank?

446
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:41,710
Okay.

447
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,750
His Cantonese is...

448
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,770
Yes, this is you.

449
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:44,570
Yes, this is you.

450
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:45,030
Yes, this is you.

451
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:45,350
Okay.

452
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:45,810
No problem.

453
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:46,710
You can speak English.

454
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:47,690
So...

455
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:48,590
So...

456
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,130
All right, guys.

457
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,330
Who's going to be carrying this time?

458
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:53,830
Yeah.

459
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:54,330
I think...

460
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:55,570
But like actually carrying.

461
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:56,610
All right.

462
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:03,030
Who's to carry?

463
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:07,370
He said he's not paying for free season, but he's confident to carry you out.

464
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:08,430
Oh.

465
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:08,930
Okay.

466
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:09,490
All right.

467
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:09,630
Who?

468
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:09,890
Who?

469
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:10,070
Who?

470
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:10,130
Who?

471
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:10,590
Jason?

472
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:12,910
Is it Jason?

473
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,250
Alright Jason, play Wraith.

474
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:15,430
Play Wraith?

475
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,530
I play Vantage though.

476
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:17,150
I play Vantage though.

477
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,730
Okay Jason, play Vantage.

478
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:19,790
Wait, you're not Jason.

479
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,530
He's Jason!

480
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:23,030
He's Jason!

481
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:24,670
Oh, this is Jason?

482
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:27,490
Sorry, I got my names mixed up.

483
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,470
Alright Jason, play Vantage.

484
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:31,170
Alright.

485
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:34,790
This is a terrible squad, but like, that's okay.

486
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:38,010
This is a terrible comp, but that's okay.

487
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,670
The comp is the weirdest comp I've ever seen.

488
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,730
A Loba, Lifeline, and Vantage.

489
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:48,890
We have no escapability, but that's okay.

490
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,690
Wait, Loba, ready up!

491
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,390
Do you have anything you want to tell Doki?

492
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:57,790
I'm very nervous right now.

493
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:02,770
It's okay.

494
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:03,870
It's okay.

495
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:05,230
I believe in you guys.

496
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,910
We can only go up after what happened.

497
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,110
We can only go up.

498
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,380
Alright, we just need one more person to ready up.

499
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,520
Yeah, it's almost ready.

500
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,400
There's a little bit of setting we are doing right now.

501
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:20,640
Oh, okay.

502
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,460
Oh, setting adjustments?

503
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,820
Yes, setting adjustments.

504
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:24,700
Okay.

505
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,060
Alright, let's do it.

506
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,200
What are you going to choose?

507
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,840
Hey, what are you going to play?

508
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,200
Fuse or maybe Fusey.

509
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,680
Fuse or Caustic.

510
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,020
Okay.

511
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,880
Yeah, you know what?

512
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,340
That works.

513
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,900
Vantage, Lifeline, Caustic.

514
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,340
We're just going to stay in a house until top three.

515
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,320
Just like Rank, I guess.

516
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:51,700
Alright.

517
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,620
Who's Jump Master?

518
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,560
Because it's not me.

519
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,880
I never jump.

520
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,140
Ooh.

521
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,780
I have confidence in this team.

522
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,280
I mean, like, you can't do worse than Thomas.

523
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,100
Like...

524
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,860
Never mind.

525
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,200
I think I forgot to change my character.

526
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,160
Ah, no, wait.

527
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:16,940
Oh, no, no.

528
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,860
You can change the character.

529
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,940
Wait a minute.

530
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,100
How...

531
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,380
We can change the character.

532
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,900
Did you lie about your credentials?

533
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,940
I forgot to change my character?

534
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,840
There's a character select screen that's been here for four years.

535
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,360
Let me transfer for you.

536
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:36,920
Alright.

537
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,820
Don't worry, Vantage.

538
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,980
I'll give all my support to you.

539
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,760
I won't go too fast this time.

540
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,020
The audience is also being praised.

541
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:50,900
Can they have some fun?

542
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:57,680
Okay.

543
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,760
So, yeah.

544
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,220
I'm bringing you guys to really hard lobbies, just so you guys know.

545
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,440
I'm bringing...

546
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:07,400
These lobbies are a lot more difficult than usual.

547
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:10,740
Alright.

548
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,180
Vantage.

549
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,600
Take us to the place.

550
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,140
The fight.

551
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,180
No sightseeing.

552
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,240
I wanna fight.

553
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,560
Where do I go?

554
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,180
Where do I go?

555
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,120
Look at the sign.

556
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:22,520
Okay.

557
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,040
Jason, where are you gonna go?

558
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:25,940
Alright.

559
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:28,080
This must be what a bullet feels like.

560
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:28,300
Alright.

561
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:28,760
Let's see.

562
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,140
I'm trying to see if there's any teens with us.

563
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,880
I can see that Jason's really pulled.

564
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,440
He doesn't seem...

565
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,700
Oh, he knows how to do the dolphin.

566
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,820
Even though we don't need to do the dolphin, because we're right here.

567
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,540
What are you doing here, Caustic?

568
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:46,800
Leave.

569
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:47,640
This is my spot.

570
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,320
Leave.

571
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,140
Mine.

572
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:51,680
Okay.

573
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,420
You have better ping.

574
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,060
That's not fair.

575
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:53,820
That's...

576
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,880
Do you... Okay.

577
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,420
I'm not shooting my gun if you're gonna take all of it.

578
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,220
Alright.

579
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,620
Is there a team here?

580
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,680
I wasn't paying attention.

581
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,480
Oh, hello.

582
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,720
I'm here for the loot, too.

583
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,300
Caustic took everything.

584
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,160
Yeah.

585
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:23,880
Let's go.

586
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,640
200 ping flatline is not great.

587
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,000
Jason!

588
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,640
There's nobody here!

589
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,000
Jason!

590
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,420
What's wrong with the settings?

591
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:34,680
Wait.

592
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:34,900

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,460

He's coming.

608
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,900
There's nobody here!

609
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,440
Enter the ring.

610
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,000

You're fine.

745
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,360
Alright.

746
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,720

Is that you?

748
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,100
That's right, play Mimik.

749
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,240
To actually be a good player.

750
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,440
Alright.

751
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,280
Is there another?

752
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,220
I think there's one more team up there.

753
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,200
There's like 20 teams here.

754
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,420
Let's go check it out guys.

755
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,940
If I die, I die.

756
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,960
Alright, let's see if we cleared the area.

757
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,620
Hey, top 10!

758
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:34,720
If we live for five more squads, we did the best.

759
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,220
Oh, I don't have a grenade.

760
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,540
I'm gonna go get a grenade.

761
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:37,560
I'm gonna go get a grenade.

762
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,940
Top five.

763
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,040
Top five, let's go!

764
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,160
I believe in us!

765
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,460
Let's see.

766
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,860
I don't see anybody.

767
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,660
I guess we can leave.

768
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,860
I think everybody died.

769
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,240
Yippee!

770
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,240
Oh.

771
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,640
There's a container here.

772
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,780
Oh, look at them.

773
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,920
Somebody died to ring.

774
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,400
Not us.

775
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:14,850
Alright.

776
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:19,110
Most likely, there could be a team in containment, so let's go over there.

777
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:24,270
There's always a certain rotation for teams.

778
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:31,030
Every team will either be in containment or like, market.

779
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,270
I don't know why.

780
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:36,890
I guess people just like being in containment or market.

781
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:44,130
Nice, we need that 3x.

782
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:47,330
Alright, guys.

783
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:51,650
Oh, see!

784
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:52,390
I told you!

785
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,270
I heard shots!

786
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:55,870
Wait.

787
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:56,750
Yeah, see!

788
00:34:58,170 --> 00:34:59,270
Every time.

789
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:01,290
Containment or market.

790
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:02,890
I might get shot.

791
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:05,270
I have no idea where.

792
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:06,870
Where they went.

793
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:11,190
Where did they go?

794
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:12,130
What?

795
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,040
Wait.

796
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,640
Am I gaslighting myself?

797
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,680
I thought I...

798
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,080
Where are they?

799
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:23,820
Wait, no!

800
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,540
We have Bloodhound!

801
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,900
Bloodhound, do the thing!

802
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,000
Go do the thing, Bloodhound!

803
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,820
Alright, I'm gonna grab...

804
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,380
I'm gonna grab the Evo Harvester.

805
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,940
Guys, we just need one team to die and then we can...

806
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:39,720
We did it.

807
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,260
We made it.

808
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,780
Alright, what do your Specialized see?

809
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,720
Okay, they're all... Oh my god, they're all in runoff.

810
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:55,740
Okay, let's go to runoff.

811
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,100
We don't have to care about this team.

812
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,020
They'll just kill themselves, I guess.

813
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,260
So, we'll go over here.

814
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,960
They're so far from zone anyway.

815
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:06,840
They're so far from zone anyway.

816
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,400
Let's see.

817
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,300
Oh yeah, everybody's at...

818
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,660
Heading to...

819
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,120
Heading to runoff fight.

820
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:20,810
Oh, I see them!

821
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:24,150
No, I don't have a redeploy!

822
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:24,610
No, I don't have a redeploy!

823
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:28,410
Alright.

824
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:29,830
Let's go!

825
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:33,850
Let's go!

826
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:36,590
We did it by doing absolutely nothing!

827
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:38,230
Alright,

828
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:42,430
I'll wait for you guys.

829
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:46,030
I'm not stupid enough to go in by myself.

830
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:47,510
They're like over there.

831
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:48,730
So I'll wait for...

832
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,290
No, I'll wait for Jason.

833
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:53,290
Alright, let's go.

834
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:58,890
I don't hear gunshots, which is what concerns me.

835
00:36:59,570 --> 00:36:59,990
Oh!

836
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,610
Now that's a mirage, isn't that?

837
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,130
That's a mirage.

838
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:05,570
There's no way he would just stand there.

839
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:08,570
Where are they?

840
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:12,370
Alright, Bloodhound!

841
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,130
You know where...

842
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:15,870
Where they are?

843
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:17,750
You see foots... Oh, right here!

844
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:17,990
Right here!

845
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:18,170
Right here!

846
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:18,810
In front of you!

847
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:20,370
Oh, whoops.

848
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:21,450
You guys didn't see that.

849
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:21,750
Oh!

850
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:22,890
But you guys saw that, right?

851
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:26,430
Alright, here's my ult.

852
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:31,770
Alright, here's my ult.

853
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:31,990
My ult!

854
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:32,390
My ult!

855
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,030
Oh...

856
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:40,370
Where are they?

857
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:41,630
Oh, they're over here.

858
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:42,830
Right here.

859
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:45,290
I think that's the only team, right?

860
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:45,910
Yeah.

861
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:48,130
They're all the way over there.

862
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:51,690
They're heading down?

863
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:55,050
Am I in zone?

864
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:55,590
I'm not.

865
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:57,610
They're like here.

866
00:37:57,930 --> 00:37:59,930
I don't like... I'm gonna get across, Angla.

867
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:02,750
I see them.

868
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:03,870
All the way over here.

869
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,010
That's a mirage.

870
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:06,470
Never mind.

871
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:07,670
I lied.

872
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,190
What?

873
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:14,190
Okay, I'm gonna do something really stupid.

874
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:14,550
Oh!

875
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:16,410
Oh!

876
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:17,110
Help him!

877
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:17,350
Help him!

878
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,020
That's another team!

879
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:22,300
Another team!

880
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:22,700
Another team!

881
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,020
Another team!

882
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:23,860
I got you!

883
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,380
Another team over there, behind us.

884
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,720
Oh, god damn it!

885
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,100
Mirage!

886
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:36,340
Um...

887
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,260
I smoked him.

888
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,000
I have nothing for you?

889
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,780
I have nothing for you?

890
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,700
Yeah, but I had to deal with a guy above me!

891
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,580
Yeah, but I had to deal with a guy above me!

892
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,360
Oh!

893
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:48,960
New team!

894
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:49,180
New team!

895
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:49,460
New team!

896
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

897
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:51,500
Up top.

898
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:51,820
Up top.

899
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,840
We can be underneath this.

900
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,420
I'm looking.

901
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,400
There is a team that shot me from behind.

902
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,440
Oh, they have a crypto.

903
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,980
Okay, that's not good for us.

904
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:01,680
Alright!

905
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:02,920
Definitely not good.

906
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:03,420
I got hit.

907
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:05,600
Oh, god.

908
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:06,080
Okay.

909
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,780
I'm gonna go into this hole.

910
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,340
This is my hole.

911
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,280
This hole is very safe, by the way.

912
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,580
I rotated.

913
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:18,980
Let's see.

914
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,200
Keep crawling!

915
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,340
Keep crawling to our bloodhound!

916
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,540
I'll cover!

917
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:26,780
Fuse!

918
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,040
Fuse!

919
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:27,280
Fuse!

920
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,120
Where's fuse?

921
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:28,760
Ping!

922
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:28,920
Ping!

923
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:29,140
Ping!

924
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:29,320
Ping!

925
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,180
Ping it!

926
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,620
Okay, that is...

927
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,380
Where did you come from?

928
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,960
Giving him the chimney.

929
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,420
Give him my shield of recharge.

930
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,000
Alright, guys.

931
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,080
Do any of you have redeploy?

932
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,240
None of us have redeploy.

933
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:44,680
Okay.

934
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,040
Haha!

935
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:48,860
Uh...

936
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,160
Haha!

937
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,260
We might be the people that die in zone.

938
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,400
We have to go to zone.

939
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,620
Top three.

940
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,520
Hey, top three!

941
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:04,320
Over here?

942
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,000
Wait, are you guys getting shot at?

943
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,440
Oh, by them.

944
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:13,880
I'm safe here?

945
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,760
Not really, but like...

946
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,920
I tried.

947
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,780
I wanna get the other two teams to fight.

948
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:23,300
This safe.

949
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:23,600
This safe.

950
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,000
Come here.

951
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,500
Okay.

952
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,480
Let's see.

953
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:30,640
Uh...

954
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,440
Yeah.

955
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:32,900
Let's do it!

956
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,080
I'll use my bat.

957
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,220
Whoa!

958
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,480
He broke the shield!

959
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:40,820
Go do that thing!

960
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:41,840
Keep doing that!

961
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,140
I'm gonna push closer.

962
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,240
Wait, they're fighting!

963
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:45,820
Go, go, go, go, go!

964
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,240
They're fighting!

965
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:46,580
They're fighting!

966
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,660
We third party!

967
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:48,940
This is it!

968
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,760
This is our shine!

969
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:50,680
Shining moment!

970
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:53,680
On me!

971
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:53,920
On me!

972
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:54,140
On me!

973
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:56,840
No, I'm on me!

974
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:57,100
JK!

975
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:57,460
JK!

976
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,160
JK!

977
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:58,560
JK!

978
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,780
Don't listen to me!

979
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,460
Don't listen to me!

980
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,600
Don't listen to me!

981
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:03,920
I was lying!

982
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,300
They stopped fighting!

983
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,480
They stopped fighting!

984
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:10,900
These nerds!

985
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:11,600
They stopped fighting!

986
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:12,600
Okay, I'm getting cross-angled.

987
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,340
You guys see where you are?

988
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,840
Yeah, see where you are!

989
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,000
I'm gonna get cross-angled.

990
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:20,540
Yeah, yeah.

991
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,240
They're getting harassed by us.

992
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,240
And the other team.

993
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:23,840
So that's good.

994
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:30,610
I cracked so many people.

995
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:33,310
I'm pushing up.

996
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:33,790
I'm pushing up.

997
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,150
You don't have to push up.

998
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:38,050
It's your choice, honestly.

999
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:40,170
Oh!

1000
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:41,290
No!

1001
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:42,670
It's okay.

1002
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,370
Don't ignore.

1003
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:43,650
Okay.

1004
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,230
No, no, no, no, no!

1005
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:47,910
That is very ballsy, but okay.

1006
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:49,450
Cover us!

1007
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:49,850
Cover us!

1008
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:52,270
If you cover us, this could be fine.

1009
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:53,430
Okay.

1010
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:55,450
Alright.

1011
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:57,650
What do your eyes see?

1012
00:41:58,410 --> 00:41:59,530
Okay, I'm coming back to you guys.

1013
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,360
Knocked.

1014
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,660
I thirsted him.

1015
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:08,620
I'm medicating.

1016
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,180
There's a body right there.

1017
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:12,980
Oh, okay.

1018
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,540
Crypto, I hope you have a very bad day after this.

1019
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:23,710
Yeah, I can.

1020
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:25,570
There you go.

1021
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:28,050
Let's see.

1022
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:28,810
It's a full team!

1023
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:29,570
It's a full team!

1024
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,330
Over here where I'm looking at.

1025
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:37,610
There's a team that has a cross on me.

1026
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:39,030
Oh, it's a Mirage.

1027
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:43,330
Okay.

1028
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:45,830
Okay.

1029
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:46,010
Whoa.

1030
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:49,070
You guys are not fun.

1031
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:54,430
Oh, here's a f- Oh!

1032
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:56,150
Hey, I think we're dead!

1033
00:42:57,930 --> 00:42:59,630
Hey, but we made it!

1034
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:00,690
We got top two!

1035
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,600
It's all about the top two, baby!

1036
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:09,780
Oh my god!

1037
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:10,380
Okay.

1038
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,400
Screw you.

1039
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,020
Oh, you're bad!

1040
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,060
You guys are so bad!

1041
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:15,420
You guys are so bad!

1042
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,780
We got top two, though!

1043
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,340
We got top two, though!

1044
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:26,620
I was in!

1045
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,440
Look, we did pretty well.

1046
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:36,740
We did pretty- I did not expect us to ever get top five, let alone top two.

1047
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:38,740
You want to stay the doggy?

1048
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,360
I saw you carry everyone.

1049
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:42,380
You're so good.

1050
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:42,540
Yeah?

1051
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,360
I'm a red planet Jankton, okay?

1052
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,920
What a carry!

1053
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,080
You want something to doggy?

1054
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,720
Oh, yeah, we did great.

1055
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:55,520
It's all the hardware's problem, not us.

1056
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:55,940
We were great.

1057
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,880
Yeah, blame the PC, of course.

1058
00:43:58,980 --> 00:43:59,860
Yeah, it's ping, too.

1059
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,480
The PC should be better, that's all I'm gonna say.

1060
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,420
Do something!

1061
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,480
I don't care about it!

1062
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,100
Thank you so much, Les.

1063
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:10,120
I'm gonna go back to the stage.

1064
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:13,740
Let's- Yeah, it's not a- Yes, it's always hardware, guys.

1065
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:14,560
You know what?

1066
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,040
You're right.

1067
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,800
My PC could be better, too.

1068
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:23,240
So intense watching you guys playing.

1069
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,380
It's like I'm sweating already on my back.

1070
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:26,500
Oh, yeah, that was intense.

1071
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:30,260
I did not expect- I did not expect the games to be that sweaty.

1072
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,000
Let's do some more chilling things.

1073
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:35,720
I wanted some questions I wanted to ask you.

1074
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,100
Yeah.

1075
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:36,800
About Hong Kong.

1076
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:40,760
So, I know you guys have played- living in Hong Kong before, right?

1077
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:41,260
Mm-hmm.

1078
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:44,020
What's the most food that you're missing in Hong Kong?

1079
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:44,660
Like, eating?

1080
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:49,480
Oh, it's just rice noodles and fish balls.

1081
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,560
Fish balls and rice noodles.

1082
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,400
You know what to prepare, right?

1083
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,360
Rice noodles and fish balls.

1084
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,160
Okay, next time.

1085
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:05,260
Also, like, there's a restaurant I don't know if a lot of people will go now, but there's a restaurant I really like called Tomato Club.

1086
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,960
Not because I like tomatoes, but because it's really good.

1087
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:12,680
Basically, it's like- I like to put any toppings on it.

1088
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,160
For tomato soup, it's really good.

1089
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:17,340
In Hong Kong?

1090
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,000
Yeah, it's in Hong Kong!

1091
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:20,240
I've didn't try this.

1092
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,740
They have a franchise in Hong Kong.

1093
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:23,500
It's called Tomato Club.

1094
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,120
You have to take me there next time.

1095
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:25,480
I've never tried it.

1096
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:26,940
It's really good.

1097
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,160
I'm really missing it.

1098
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:32,780
Okay, so the second question is, what do you know about Anycorn or Comic-Con?

1099
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,620
What do you actually bought in Anycorn or Comic-Con?

1100
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,320
What did you buy?

1101
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:41,520
When I was younger, I used to buy figures.

1102
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:42,780
Nendoroid.

1103
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:44,140
I really like buying Nendoroid.

1104
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,720
At ACGHK.

1105
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:50,160
And I really like to visit- You guys don't call it Artist Alley, but other places.

1106
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,540
But there are a lot of small artists who put things on the shelves and buy things.

1107
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:55,160
I really like buying their stuff.

1108
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:57,560
I used to buy a lot of Madoka stuff.

1109
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:02,960
What did they buy this time?

1110
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,440
What's popular this time?

1111
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:05,640
Oh, it's a gold medal!

1112
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,080
I bought your hat.

1113
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:11,340
Yes, I bought your hat.

1114
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:14,080
I know what I buy in Comic-Con this time.

1115
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:15,760
Next year, we still need to buy your products, okay?

1116
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:18,040
It's so true.

1117
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:25,860
So, for the fourth question, I'm going to ask your fans, the dragoons, what they want to ask you and talk with you.

1118
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:27,540
Like doing some more chilling section.

1119
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:30,620
So I'm going down and choosing some audience right now.

1120
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,660
Okay, let's go down and interview everyone.

1121
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:37,620
Did you choose the question section?

1122
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:38,660
Does anyone want to ask a question?

1123
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:41,180
Do you have any questions you want to ask the doggies?

1124
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,120
Who wants to ask me a question?

1125
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:44,660
Let's go back to the studio.

1126
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:57,220
Okay, I will ask this pretty lady first.

1127
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,280
What's your question?

1128
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,300
You made a song in Augustra.

1129
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,660
When did you use that song?

1130
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:06,940
When did I use it?

1131
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:07,620
I didn't use it.

1132
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:12,540
She made a lot of different songs for the first time.

1133
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:15,340
I don't know.

1134
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:17,220
I was going to post it on YouTube.

1135
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:22,340
But I was going to commission an animation for the song.

1136
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:23,660
I don't want to just post it like this.

1137
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:29,680
So I'm waiting for a I'm thinking of what story for the animation for the song.

1138
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,360
I don't know.

1139
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:33,000
I really don't know.

1140
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:34,920
I have a lot of songs and I don't know what to do.

1141
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:38,320
What's your question?

1142
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:40,700
Hello, my name is Isaac.

1143
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,160
I want to ask you a question.

1144
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:50,840
I want to ask you a question about if you were going back to Hong Kong, what's the first thing you would do in Hong Kong?

1145
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,760
What's the first thing?

1146
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:55,200
What's the first thing?

1147
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,040
Going to Mong Kok.

1148
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:02,060
I miss Mong Kok.

1149
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,180
I love going there.

1150
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:06,120
If you go to Mong Kok, you can get fish roe and rice noodles.

1151
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:07,540
Yes, yes.

1152
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:09,240
And there are a lot of things to buy.

1153
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,600
I always go to Mong Kok to buy.

1154
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:14,080
And Hong Kong's Disney.

1155
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:15,060
Oh, I see.

1156
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:17,500
I heard they have a lot of new things in Hong Kong.

1157
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:21,300
Let me choose one more.

1158
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:23,440
There are.

1159
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:23,680
There are.

1160
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:24,420
Both sides have it.

1161
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:29,090
So many questions.

1162
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:37,070
We don't talk with you so much.

1163
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:38,370
We miss you so much.

1164
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:47,480
The question is Do you miss 5v5 or 6v6 Overwatch?

1165
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,140
6v6 Overwatch.

1166
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:48,900
Okay.

1167
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:53,900
I had a big rant about it.

1168
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:01,240
But like if we do 6v6 again for Overwatch with the tanks, how busted the tanks are now?

1169
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:05,800
Like, you know, with their 10,000 HP and 50,000 damage.

1170
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:08,280
Like Zarya with any other tank.

1171
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,260
I think like if they don't nerf the tanks, we are so...

1172
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:17,380
I'm trying to like filter myself here because I have so many things I could say.

1173
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,960
But there's children here.

1174
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:26,200
But I would love 6v6.

1175
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:36,080
But the current situation with the tank being like raid boss level 5v5 is the most optimal right now.

1176
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:40,000
Also, we don't care about what DPS feels.

1177
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:43,500
DPS, you had no opinion in this game for five years now.

1178
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:44,400
So I'm sorry.

1179
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:46,540
Especially Pharah players.

1180
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:47,360
Especially Pharah players.

1181
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:47,460
I'm sorry.

1182
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:48,140
Yeah.

1183
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:52,720
Look at this loser still playing Pharah in 2024.

1184
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:54,960
Okay.

1185
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:56,140
Thank you very much.

1186
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:57,100
Okay.

1187
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:59,940
Let me come back to the stage again.

1188
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:09,840
So Dokie, I know that after Q&A question and we played very intense Apex game, we have some little chilling mini game with your friends again, right?

1189
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:10,900
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1190
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,360
It's still not the end.

1191
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:16,820
There's one last game, guys.

1192
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:19,520
I believe I teach you the Chinese name yesterday.

1193
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,700
Do you remember the name?

1194
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:22,320
The game name?

1195
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:24,740
Oh, Dokiewa.

1196
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:25,380
Yes.

1197
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,580
It's like Simon Says.

1198
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:30,500
Yes, it's actually Simon Says.

1199
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:35,120
So we're going to choose 10 fans come up here for participation to the Dokiewa.

1200
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,940
Let me let you by section.

1201
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:40,180
I will choose five here and five over there.

1202
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:40,500
Okay?

1203
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:45,660
I don't even know if that's like a good thing getting chosen.

1204
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:49,580
Yes.

1205
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:50,160
Yes.

1206
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:55,760
The guy with glasses on the back is the one in the high heels.

1207
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:57,800
Hi.

1208
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:07,110
Hi.

1209
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:07,750
Hi.

1210
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:08,250
Welcome to the stage.

1211
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:11,530
Welcome to the stage, everybody.

1212
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:12,210
Okay.

1213
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:12,950
One by one.

1214
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,090
Let's line up in a straight line.

1215
00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:15,270
Okay.

1216
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:15,970
That's about it.

1217
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:16,810

1218
00:51:18,330 --> 00:51:20,990
My name is Sasa.

1219
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:24,530
How do you...

1220
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:25,190
Okay.

1221
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:27,510
He's saying in English.

1222
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:28,570
Okay.

1223
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:32,110
You see my dad today.

1224
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:33,370
Oh, he's called Sasa.

1225
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:33,910
Oh my God.

1226
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:34,630
Look, there's dad.

1227
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:35,430

Okay, Peg.

1248
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:05,210
Okay.

1249
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:06,630
Nice to meet you.

1250
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:07,210

1251
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:08,090

Call me Aaron.

00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:17,390
Scallop.

1256
00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:20,170
So, Doggy, do you remember all your names already?

1257
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:21,470
Scallop.

1258
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:21,510
Yeah.

1259
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:23,470
I forgot like half your names.

1260
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:23,910
I'm sorry.

1261
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:24,350
Yeah, me too.

1262
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:29,030
So, do you guys all know how to play Do-Ki-Wa?

1263
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:31,350
It's what Simon says.

1264
00:52:31,870 --> 00:52:32,690
I don't know how to play.

1265
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:33,370
Can you raise your hand?

1266
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:34,890
I don't know how to play.

1267
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:35,690
Okay, I'll say it again.

1268
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:38,570
Do-Ki-Wa is actually Simon's say.

1269
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:40,690
Do-Ki will give you a command later.

1270
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:44,230
Every time he says Do-Ki-Wa, you have to follow his command to do the command.

1271
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:46,790
For example, I'll demo it now.

1272
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:48,290
Do-Ki-Wa, raise both hands.

1273
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:50,630
Put your hands down.

1274
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:51,870
Put your hands down.

1275
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:53,410
I didn't say Do-Ki-Wa.

1276
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:56,510
Okay, now put your hands down.

1277
00:52:57,170 --> 00:52:58,710
Do-Ki-Wa, put your hands down.

1278
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:00,970
Okay, everyone get ready.

1279
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:03,130
Okay, I trained them already.

1280
00:53:03,370 --> 00:53:04,250
Do-Ki, it's your turn.

1281
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:05,370
It's your turn.

1282
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:06,390
Sure, okay.

1283
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:09,930
Do-Ki-Wa 2.

1284
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:12,810
Do-Ki-Wa 2.

1285
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:14,630
Do-Ki-Wa 2.

1286
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:16,010
Do-Ki-Wa 2.

1287
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:17,450
Do-Ki-Wa 2.

1288
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:20,070
Do-Ki-Wa 2.

1289
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:22,210
Do-Ki-Wa 2.

1290
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:22,570
Do -Ki-Wa 2.

1291
00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:26,770
Who?

1292
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:27,450
Who?

1293
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:28,190
Who jumped?

1294
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:30,610
Okay, you jumped.

1295
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:33,750
Okay, we'll do it again.

1296
00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:36,410
We'll do it again.

1297
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:36,770
We'll do it again.

1298
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:37,550
