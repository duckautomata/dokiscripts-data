Huge shoutout and thank you to the devs for reaching out tried a new racing game.

10
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:37,580
Alright, it's time to come out of racing retirement and win the Grand Prix.

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,240
One last job.

12
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,200
It's time, pre-recorded Doki.

13
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,580
I believe in you.

14
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,160
You don't need chat to hold your racing wheel and back to you.

15
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,440
Take it away, pre-recorded Doki number two.

16
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,640
Thanks, pre-recorded Doki.

17
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,060
Hello, everybody.

18
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,740
It's also pre-recorded Doki here.

19
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,000
Yes, I am so excited to try out Sonic Racing Crossworlds.

20
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,880
Do you remember when I first saw the trailer for this game?

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,300
I was like, Miku Hatsune and Steve?

22
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:23,420
So for those who don't know, the DLC characters that you can get for Sonic Racing Crossworld, there's Steve, there's Avatar, there's Pac-Man, and Teenage Moon and Ninja Turtles, and also SpongeBob.

23
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,480
The thing is, there's also free characters.

24
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:25,940
So in the

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,480
I'm like, oh my god, this is like the greatest crossover in history.

26
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,080
Oh my god, Sonic and Friends.

27
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,720
And look, oh my god, and oh my god, there's a lot of cars.

28
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,980
Oh my gosh, this song's a banger.

29
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,500
I think that's what I love about Sonic, too.

30
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,000
Like, they have some really good songs.

31
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,560
Is that even legal?

32
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,200
Why don't I just play Shadow?

33
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:54,040
I can literally play as a monster truck and just, he just destroyed his car.

34
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,280
Why wouldn't I play as Shadow?

35
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,080
Yeah.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,920
All right, okay, we definitely need the tutorial because I don't know how to play.

37
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,450
Guess it's time to get into the race.

38
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:17,990
I don't, oh, okay, I'm one player because I'm by myself, but that's okay.

39
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:18,970
That's okay.

40
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,150
Who needs friends when I can win, you know?

41
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,030
Oh my god, there's Igman's child.

42
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,410
I forgot his name.

43
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:25,030
Her name.

44
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,450
Yeah, okay, I gotta be Shadow.

45
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,370
I love Latinas.

46
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:27,950
All right.

47
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:29,890
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:34,710
I know, like, this is a Sonic game and I should play the main character, but they have.

49
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:35,770
shadow.

50
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:38,910
Okay, where's the monster truck?

51
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,550
I could just bring like the skateboards over.

52
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,850
I'm gonna get that one.

53
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,190
Wait, normal rate.

54
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:45,890
Wait, quick charge.

55
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,010
I feel like double boost seems the best.

56
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,870
It gives you an advantage in general.

57
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,550
Round one, E Stadium.

58
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,070
Oh, that's like the first world.

59
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,650
I love the original Sonic world, like the level one Sonic world.

60
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:58,850
It's so cute.

61
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:00,450
That's me.

62
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,270
That's right.

63
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:35,230

Wait, did I use it on my... No, no, okay, I just bumped into this fight.

65
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,410
Oh, my God, there's so many things going on.

66
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:43,850
It's so fast.

67
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,150
Oh, I'm so close.

68
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:46,910
I just need one item.

69
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,810
I just literally need one item to rule them off.

70
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,990
Oh, I need to be close to her.

71
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,950
Oh, I didn't know.

72
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,570
No!

73
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,180
No!

74
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,280
It's okay.

75
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,500
I still have the other races.

76
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,520
I still have the other races.

77
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,020
It's fine.

78
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:05,600
It's fine.

79
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,200
It's just a warm-up, guys.

80
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,420
It's a No!

81
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,680
Down is up!

82
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,340
I know they just taught me that!

83
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,940
Alright, I have another boost though.

84
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,240
What?

85
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:16,980
Red!

86
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,840
They don't care!

87
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,840
License clean!

88
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,280
Oh my gosh, she took away all my coins too.

89
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,240
She literally robbed me in the middle of it.

90
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,020
Random track.

91
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,740
Oh, it transports me to a different track!

92
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,980
Oh, oh, no, no, don't hit me, don't hit me, don't hit me!

93
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,420
Don't hit me!

94
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,040
No!

95
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,940
No, my God!

96
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:37,540
No!

97
00:04:38,940 --> 00:05:06,160

98
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,740
I like how Eggman's last.

99
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,300
I like how his child beat him, too.

100
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,620
Oh, dragon looks.

101
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,100
Oh, my God.

102
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,860
Where am I?

103
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,280
We're literally in a dragon.

104
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,460
That's fine.

105
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,900
Oh, no, that's not fine.

106
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,580
That's not fine.

107
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,900
I still have a lot.

108
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,880
I still have a lot of coins, though.

109
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,760
I still have a lot of coins.

110
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,160
Alright, we're boosting.

111
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:31,680
We're boosting.

112
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,520

00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:35,800
We can salvage it.

116
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,600
Oh no!

117
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:37,220

We're all so close to each other!

119
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,280
We're all so close.

This is the thing that got first place.

00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,230
I know it's crying.

130
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:57,810
Here's the guy you made fun of in high school.

131
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,830
Oh, this is the final lap.

132
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:00,770
Come on.

133
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:01,890
I literally just need a win.

That's right.

145
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,510
You don't got any.

146
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,630

147
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:32,530

It's almost Halloween.

I want to try that.

153
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,650
Cream, why are you on the enemy team?

154
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:42,370
Oh my god, I really, I already forgot the objective.

155
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:46,390
And it was, it was the bump into them.

156
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,130
And I didn't do any of that.

157
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:48,650
It's okay.

158
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,210
My team is second place.

159
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,250
It's okay.

160
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,210
And there's two.

161
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,250
It's only two teams.

162
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:58,110
And my team is, oh, doing, oh, that's the monster truck.

163
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,450
That's a power-up.

164
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:00,810
Oh, that's sick.

165
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,390
I didn't realize that was a Power up.

166
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,030
Okay, I got another monster truck.

167
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:06,410
Oh.

168
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:08,910
Okay.

169
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:12,650
Not gonna lie, I thought the monster truck was auto.

170
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,030
That's my bad.

171
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,350
That's okay.

172
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:18,990
I did it.

173
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,150
This is a team effort.

174
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:27,270
