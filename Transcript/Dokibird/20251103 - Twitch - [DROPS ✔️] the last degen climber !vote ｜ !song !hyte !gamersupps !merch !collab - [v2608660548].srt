1
00:01:48,890 --> 00:02:20,510
one hello hello why am i awake at this time my sleep schedule is beyond fucked right now literally right after the sponsor i i didn't even eat dinner by the way i like passed out at at 8 p.m i was done i think it was not even it was like i think it was like 7 30 to 8 p.m i was like i'm done because i was awake at like four in the morning last night and obviously um I am awake at 3.30 in the morning this time.

2
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,070
It's not, it's not doing so well.

3
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,870
My sleep schedule is not very healthy, right?

4
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:32,770
I am like, like, I'm perpetually just, I'm always trying to catch up on sleep debt at the moment.

5
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:33,650
So this is not good.

6
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:37,530
I also have yet to touch Street Fighter, which is also not good.

7
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,630
Because, okay, so there is a reason why I have yet to touch Street Fighter.

8
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:46,470
Let me like get Marvel Rivals on the screen real quick before I talk about Street Fighter.

9
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,310
a completely different game.

10
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:52,990
Give me a sec.

11
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:57,810
Let me change my screen real quick.

12
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,470
Like I said, I don't know why it does that.

13
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:07,010
It always like changes my monitor to my second monitor, which is so fucking annoying.

14
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,030
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.

15
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:09,890
My varavos.

16
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:10,830
All right.

17
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,470
So the reason why I have...

18
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:35,490
yet to touch Street Fighter is because my coaching session doesn't start until Tuesday and I am in a little bit of a predicament because I talked to Justin you know I'm on first-name bases with the the Wazler but mr.

19
00:03:35,550 --> 00:04:46,250
Wong and he told me that Zangief got a bit of a nerf so I was like that's not fun you know that's not like you know like that's not fun having a a grappler being nerfed so um so then I ask nephew who is also for this one why am I playing street fighter I have a street fighter tournament uh this week that's officially sponsored by Capcom so um you know I have less than six days to learn how to play street fighter again um which I should have learned street fighter like you know maybe two like a week ago but I was so busy and I am also very busy this week as well so last week I was so busy this week it's also the same type of business so it's it it doesn't stop um but then now I have to fit in um street fighter practice so basically I was like okay this is unfortunate so I was like asking nephew uh who is my actual coach or the uh yeah why am I not playing street fighter right now instead of my rivals because I want to be not look there's a lot of I'm very greedy.

20
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,970
There's a lot of things that I want.

21
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,170
And I'm very greedy.

22
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,730
And I also want to be nominated for Marvel Rivals in the Streamer Awards.

23
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:00,530
So that's why we're not playing Street Fighter right now.

24
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,210
I'm already guaranteed in the Street Fighter tournament.

25
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:07,170
But I'm not guaranteed into the Marvel Rivals nomination.

26
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:10,350
So I'm trying to secure it right now.

27
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:12,790
Anyway.

28
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:26,690
Anyway, so I was talking to Nephew, and, you know, I'll say this on stream too, so I'll repeat this story, because, you know, some people don't watch me on Twitch, and it's also 4 in the morning, so I feel like a lot of people aren't watching me right now.

29
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:34,530
Like, a lot of the main dragoons aren't really watching me right now, because they might be actually, you know, doing normal things like sleeping.

30
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:44,770
But, but anyway, so I was talking to Nephew, and I was like, what do I play?

31
00:05:45,070 --> 00:06:41,310
I play Zangief or like do I learn something new because like at this point I might as well be a new player because I forgot everything about Zangief like I legitimately don't even know like what the controls are or anything so um so I was just like what do I do and okay let me read you so Nephew was like did you like Zangief and I literally was like well I only picked them because I asked chat which character would tilt my opponent the most like and easy to abuse I'm really like I would like to play the character that is most easily abusable and will make the enemy team very mad like that's I don't care who it is as long as it does the the two criteria that I wanted um yeah I just want to play something that's easiest to abuse and make people the most angry.

32
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,370
That's all I want.

33
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,010
I don't care.

34
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,750
Because he was like, are you attached to Zangief?

35
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:51,030
And I was like, I just want, I'm just here for the easy ride, you know?

36
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:54,770
And to make others suffer.

37
00:06:55,190 --> 00:07:00,450
So at that time, that's when Zangief was suggested to me to learn.

38
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,710
Because he fits that criteria.

39
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,370
But then he got nerfed.

40
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,490
So I was like, what the fuck do I play?

41
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,630
Do I still play Zangief?

42
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,590
he was like, okay, here are some picks that you could do.

43
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:19,130
You gotta keep playing Zane Keep because even though he's nerfed, it doesn't really affect until higher level, but his damage output is a bit lower.

44
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,530
I was like, I don't like that.

45
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:23,950
I don't like that.

46
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:32,570
If I'm fucking trying, if I like grapple you and then throw your head to the ground, it should still give you a concussion.

47
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:36,390
It shouldn't give you like a little oopsie thing.

48
00:07:36,930 --> 00:08:48,550
I should be close to breaking your fucking neck um so i was like i don't know if i like that so and then he was like okay but there's uh but if you really want a character that's very easily abusable and will make new players really mad you should try honda um and then he was like but we also have jp so but he was like but i don't know if you can do jp because he was trying to say my brain is he didn't imply that my brain was too small with JP but like he was like there's a lot you can get very overwhelmed as a new player which I took it as I'm too stupid to play JP so so and he's right he's right I am too stupid to play JP if he has more than four buttons like it's over for me like because I legit told him I was like I okay this is what I wrote to him I tend to just learn three the four moves and then just and just spam it until it works i'm not the best with executing combos and then nephew was like yeah i think honda would be the best fit for you like

49
00:08:53,690 --> 00:10:05,230
so um yeah so so that jp has too much apparently you have to have like a really fucking giant ass brain to play jp and i don't think i can do that because if it's more than four moves it's over for me um so yes now i'm in a difficult position on whether or not I play Honda or keep with Zangief because apparently um um apparently Honda is like he's not good at high level but like for the new bracket like it's very easy to like um it's very hard to counter Honda in the beginner bracket so because it's literally four moves apparently for modern Honda I just have to press one button and he does his entire like combo he does he does the combo that um that tilts people the most and like if it's and it's just one button so i was like that sounds good like that sounds great like yeah for yeah just one button and he does this entire like charge combo i don't know what the fuck he meant by that but like i heard like um you can just hit that one button and then he does it all and i was like oh

50
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:59,210
that sounds really fun like one button let's go yeah so now i'm in a predicament so that's why i haven't like played street fighter because i don't know if i'm staying with zangif or if i'm playing honda and because there's another reason why i don't know because i will reveal my secret my secret coach I still haven't like been this is why I haven't had a schedule yet because I also like I'm trying to like We're trying to fit our schedules together with my other coach And I will reveal the secret coach at my 4 30 in the morning marvel rival stream To show the other dragons they're missing out that shouldn't have went to bed Also don't don't listen I that's a joke guys please have a healthier sleep schedule than me That's a joke,

51
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:08,090
but this is for all the Asia dragoons and EU dragoons and also the ones that have just as much of a fucked up schedule as me.

52
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:18,350
So I got in touch with Big Bird because, you know, like, because we're the bird family.

53
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,170
Like Angry Bird, Big Bird, Doki Bird.

54
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:27,230
So I got in touch with Big Bird and he's down to do a coaching session with me.

55
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,250
It'll be like 9 p.m.

56
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:29,570
PST.

57
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:30,810
I don't know the day yet.

58
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,850
Because we're waiting for his schedule right now.

59
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:36,890
Because he's like trying to figure out like what is the best day.

60
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,490
And that is also why my schedule isn't out yet.

61
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:43,810
Because like I also having an extra coaching session with Big Bird.

62
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:44,250
Yes.

63
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:45,550
Ada.

64
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,150
I think that's like his other.

65
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:48,990
His not fun name call.

66
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,110
I get to see.

67
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,030
I told you.

68
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:56,730
I told you I'm officially in the bird family.

69
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,330
Now I just need anger.

70
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:51,510
bird and i've collected them all i've collected all the birds uh yeah his normie name yeah so um so uh this is also why my schedule um isn't um isn't like out yet because i uh he told me that he'll let me know today uh when uh he'll let me know today and when when he can like when we his schedule the session it'll be either he said it'll be either wednesday or thursday so i don't know man this week is like super fucking packed it's also why i don't know if i'll have a rest week a rest day at all because it's like back to back to back and even saturday i have like an apex hide and seek tournament which by the way i should really check up on that because i have no idea if like it's this week so but i feel like i have not heard anything about it so that's a little concerning.

71
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,830
I should look at that server real quick.

72
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,030
Give me a second.

73
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:59,350
Let me, I feel like there's been no announcements.

74
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:02,310
So let me, I don't, I haven't been tagged in anything.

75
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:10,870
So let me look at that server, because I realized, wait, that's a little, that's a little concerning that I haven't heard anything about.

76
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:14,650
Okay.

77
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:19,630
Okay.

78
00:13:19,630 --> 00:14:44,730
okay they're still prepping it okay it seems like no announcement has been up yet so wait did i wait a minute okay oh oh fuck that was last year i was like wait a minute did they start or it i was like okay no i'm looking at last years no i i'm a hider um um wait where's this fuck i'm looking at last year's server okay this is this year's server okay at everyone okay all right let me read this at everyone real quick um information uh okay so there hasn't really been any there has oh no i'm a seeker by the way not a hider i'm a seeker sorry i forgot how hide how to play hide and seek but i'm here to find people okay so they haven't publicly said anything but it is this week i i hope it's still this week but it is this saturday so so i'm just i'm just hoping that like you know everything is still but if there isn't a hot and sea tournament um on saturday then it's a free day for me yay because yeah so the schedule it looks like it's gonna be a lot of street fighter i don't know if i can

79
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:49,230
fit anything else um because i feel really bad that I have not practiced street fighter.

80
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:50,630
I'm not touched street fighter yet.

81
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:51,690
We might touch a little bit here.

82
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,610
Like I said, I don't know what to play.

83
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:54,830
I don't know, guys.

84
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:55,210
I don't know.

85
00:14:55,350 --> 00:15:01,910
Because I feel like if I did get coaching for Honda when I start my coaching session on Honda, maybe I'll be like a fucking god.

86
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:13,610
Because it's one button, you know, like maybe I'll be like, because like, you know, I didn't know how to play Zangiv until I got coached on how to play Zangiv.

87
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:19,250
So I'm just like thinking, like, I remember I didn't really like Honda at first because I didn't really know how to play him.

88
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:22,290
And like Zangief, I literally was just abusing the grapple.

89
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:34,330
But like for Honda, I felt like, I feel like, oh, I need to get coached to see, to actually like know if I, if I do want to play, if I do want to play, uh, play him.

90
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:43,710
So, so it's, I'm in a really tough, because if I, if I play Zangief, I can literally like try to do him right now because like, I feel like it'll come back to me.

91
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:48,470
As long as I remember which button was to grab, I feel like...

92
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:56,650
The moment I remember how to grab someone, it all comes back to me.

93
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,670
But I don't know.

94
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,930
I don't know about Honda.

95
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,450
Because I've never actually played them before.

96
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:04,950
Yeah, and then people...

97
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:07,930
The thing is, they nerfed the damage.

98
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:11,370
They nerfed the damage for Xankeep.

99
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:12,590
So I don't know.

100
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:14,710
my loyal fans?

101
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:15,870
I don't know.

102
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,530
Or do I do something new?

103
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:26,390
Because at that point, I might as well like, I'm actually, like, a new player at that point.

104
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,330
But yeah, so we'll figure this out.

105
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:30,770
We'll figure it.

106
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:33,990
Maybe we'll fucking try a little bit of Street Fighter there today.

107
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:38,710
Like I said, I don't run around, but anyway, let's play some Rankeroonies.

108
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:45,670
I don't know how much I'm gonna, I don't know how much I'm going to play ranked today.

109
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:50,490
At this point, I'm just doing it just so because I needed to pad my...

110
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:57,030
Well, I already have 100 hours, but I want the people to look at my channel and be like, did we get rated?

111
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,510
I don't want them to be like, did we get rated?

112
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,910
Or someone like bot nominated me.

113
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:06,630
So I was like, oh, no, she actually does stream rivals.

114
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,130
Salvia, thank you for the tier one sub.

115
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,290
Thank you, thank you.

116
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:24,410
And I don't want to do too much because then it would feel like, you know, it would feel like, you know, it would feel like a chore instead of me actually wanting to play rank.

117
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:29,370
So I'm just going to play rank until I don't feel like it anymore, which could be like two hours.

118
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,690
It could be six hours.

119
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:31,450
Who knows?

120
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,590
I do have a stream today as well.

121
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,490
So who the fuck knows how I feel?

122
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:42,570
No, I just feel like, you know, it looks wrong.

123
00:17:43,710 --> 00:18:17,200
obviously someone who does stream rivals every single day um and then they look at me like but i have passion for rivals i have a lot of passion for the game it's just that you know i have to also sort of be a variety streamer like like the rivals is just a bonus like a hobby like streaming is my job and marble rivals is my hobby like oh my god mega thank you for really appreciate it Thank you so much.

124
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,440
Oh my god.

125
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,260
It really means a lot, man.

126
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,100
Thank you so much for the 20 gifted subs.

127
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,660
Also, Wafi, thank you for the tier one sub.

128
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,120
Thank you.

129
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,040
Thank you.

130
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:31,720
Um, so yeah, like, um, I'm not watching this shit.

131
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,100
He's like, have some money.

141
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,540
He just, like, went to the restaurant, paid for his water, and then left.

142
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,700
What a sin today.

143

And I have someone who got into the grand finals.

189
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:48,650
Like...

190
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,430
Do you think you want to be today?

191
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:55,310
I don't have three GM players.

192
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:56,670
That's it.

193
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:57,830
It's rocket time.

194
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:03,350
So we got into the MRC finals and the second in the enemy team.

195
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:04,650
And I have GM players.

196
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,990
I should get the MRC finalists.

197
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,250
Oh yeah.

198
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:13,070
I did watch the finals in the semi-finalists.

199
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:17,170
I did watch the MR, what's it, Ignite, the million dollar Ignite.

200
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,130
Which hell is this?

201
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:22,350
Do you know everyone that queues at this fucking degenerate hour?

202
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:29,910
Like, but I did watch a little bit of Ignite and Doom Raid.

203
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,170
That's good side.

204
00:24:34,870 --> 00:25:46,210
And, um, I will say, I mean, other than, like, the dude crying and, like, super passionate um i will say the games were not that exciting because it was just everyone knew that vp was just gonna win and it felt like it was just a hard stomp on one team every game like like for the semi-finals for the quarterfinals for the semi-finals and then the finals it just felt like hard stomp on one side so it just didn't feel like uh um it just didn't it didn't feel like an exciting watch you know because you know exactly which team was gonna win in each matchup like it was obviously you know it was obviously uh uh vp and then navi and it was gonna be vp and navi but vp was gonna win because uh vp was the strongest team overall so it wasn't that exciting I was just like I did watch it but I was just like it just felt super predictable it's more exciting when you know the matches are a lot closer

205
00:25:49,910 --> 00:26:15,410
yeah but then if because it was the last day the thing is it was the last day for the tournament but like you know it was the last day like All the matches there was just a stomp for one team like it none of the matches were close like none of the matchups Is there like four four one four one four one or four zero four one four one

206
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,770
I don't know my team was so bad.

207
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:22,490
It was actually so sad What?

208
00:26:23,650 --> 00:27:32,250
I don't even know what you're saying I don't know that's just how this game is I feel like majority players here also EU at this time because right now because it didn't because it's a regular time for them oh no not a sidewalk stranger danger I hope you're gonna help this help him hello hello we're gonna say hello here too hey guys there is a lot of people here there's a rebuy beacon back there though yeah whoa hey guys there's a hell of behind us I should have said something but like fuck them I guess though I'm doing something very hard right now and that is this holy shit please tell me I live oh my god oh my god okay nice Guys,

213
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:39,490

214
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:43,330
I don't put it out in the open anymore, guys.

215
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:48,310

Okay, it's gone.

I don't know what happened.

272
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,210
I have a little word.

273
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:09,910
Oh shit.

274
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:11,130

275
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:11,910
We have ult.

276
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:13,110
That's right.

277
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,530
That's what my ult was for.

278
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:18,470
I knew he was gonna name her that.

279
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:21,690
So I used that to save us.

280
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:24,130
And it worked.

281
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:25,770
We were saved.

282
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:28,210
Oh my god.

283
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:29,730
Oh my god.

284
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:30,790
I have to reload though.

285
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:35,550
Okay, I can't save that.

286
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:37,370
I don't know.

287
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:39,590
Do I play a different healer?

288
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:41,570
Like, I don't think I'm the problem.

289
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:45,310
I don't think...

290
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,730
I mean, I could...

291
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:47,830
I guess I will.

292
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:48,910

293
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:49,750
Wait, I vaulted again.

294
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:50,250
Let's go.

295
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:51,850
I'm not the problem.

296
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:57,710
I think I should play maybe Invis.

297
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,650
Because I can get enough...

298
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:02,510
They do have name more.

299
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:03,490
Actually, I don't know.

300
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:06,190
Oh, right, let's...

301
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:08,310
Hmm...

302
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:08,530
Hmm...

303
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:11,930
Do I go a real healing?

304
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:14,090
Hmm...

305
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:15,310
So high.

306
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,650
Oh, my God.

307
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:21,270
Wait, what the fuck?

308
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,050
Wait, there's a...

309
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:23,250
Hella right behind us.

310
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:27,390
We're just letting this one guy thank us.

311
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,050
He's still behind us!

312
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:31,070
Bro!

313
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,650
I don't know if we make it.

314
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,530
Wait, I thought we were going to cloak up.

315
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:37,390
Gotta block me.

316
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,230
Oh, that's unlucky.

317
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:43,070
Portal up.

318
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:43,870
Oh, shit.

319
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:44,970
That's not unlucky anymore.

320
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:46,330
Oh, my God.

321
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:46,670
Okay.

322
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:50,530
No point.

323
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:53,730
Oh, my God.

324
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:54,930
Oh, my God.

325
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:55,370
Oh, my God.

326
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,250
Oh, my God.

327
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:58,170
Here we go.

328
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:58,730
Here we go.

329
00:32:58,750 --> 00:32:59,010
Here we go.

330
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:00,050
Here we go.

331
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:01,270
Just in case.

332
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:03,270
For this one gat.

333
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:09,990
Oh Okay, it's fine I can't kill her.

334
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:18,890
I'm fucking one the raccoon How do I kill do you see the damage on this fucking gun?

335
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:31,370
Selfiest hello, like I literally do like p damage to this gat You're doing what?

336
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:36,450
I'm like, I'm just one little raccoon in a big, scary world.

337
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:39,170
Oh my god, we finally went back, Mito.

338
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:41,310
Finally.

339
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:44,150
Oh my god.

340
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:45,730
We're good.

341
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:52,770
That's unlucky that our strange had to die like that.

342
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,690
I mean, I could still go a real character.

343
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,370
But like, oh, okay, I mean, that's my sign.

344
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:15,850
I guess that's that's the universe telling me I should swap but I mean they're not going dive so it's fine that's the thing I can play this just because they're not going dive

345
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:23,790
Jesus Chris you got like every heal in the fucking world for that

346
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:44,510
okay guys there is still like these guys i don't even know is any of my team technically flanking oh my god that should have hit that should have been oh thank god no

347
00:34:47,970 --> 00:35:24,590

348
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:29,050
They're going to get rid of the command for Luna.

349
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:30,890
Because they're flanking a lot.

350
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:32,170
They're just shooting from behind.

351
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:33,750
I mean, he's right.

352
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:35,590
They are.

353
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:39,550
Literally, I'm just getting a shot in the back.

354
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:43,750
A week and a half for the final episodes.

355
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,050
I'll just wait for the final episode.

356
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:46,810
I like playing everything at once.

357
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:47,610
I don't like wait.

358
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:48,090
I don't like...

359
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:49,790
I personally hate episodic shit.

360
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:52,030
I don't...

361
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:53,710
Because it's like, I forget what happens.

362
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:55,170
Who is our flanker?

363
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:57,150
Does our name our flanker or is our hella flanker?

364
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:16,460
Fine, I guess I'll play Luna Because they're not going I only go to rocket when they're dive and they usually dive I guess at this time people don't know how to play dive

365
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:28,560
Oh my god Eelom, thank you again Oh, thank you, El Omega Thank you again for the subs Thank you for the 50 gifted.

366
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,240
Thank you so much.

367
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,080
I really appreciate it.

368
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,380
Thank you.

369
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,640
See, I know you couldn't escape Marvel Rivals.

370
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,360
I know you'd come back.

371
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,980
I knew it.

372
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,020
No one truly escapes Marvel Rivals.

373
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,300
Jesus Christ.

374
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:31,410
The only scary part about this is that I have to be like so careful with my positioning too because as rocket i can oh my like i i don't know what you want me to do i literally you're getting so much healing right now holy fuck oh my god there's just too much damage well thank you for gifting us up to mega thank you thank you bro there It was just so much damage.

375
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:32,550
There was nothing I could do.

376
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:35,810
All I did was heal.

377
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:38,030
They were not healthy, guys.

378
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,050
They were absolutely not healthy.

379
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:43,530
I'm going to rock it over here.

380
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:52,770
Get predicted.

381
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,950
But also, I did it to save my own life.

382
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:59,970
It was technically not a prediction.

383
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:02,110
I saw myself low HP.

384
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:05,010
And I was like, I got to save my ass.

385
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:07,330
Get predicted!

386
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:15,710
That was a really bad Invisal.

387
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:21,590
Who the fuck did I kill?

388
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:25,530
I missed my heal and I shot someone.

389
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:27,470
Like, I'll take it.

390
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,340
Are you serious?

391
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:39,500
I like how I missed my shot and I got a kill out of it.

392
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,470
Yeah, I know

393
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:57,550
The thing is they're they don't even have oh my we just let the hell just

394
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:04,610
I died because hell was above and I painted like like a minute ago.

395
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:10,090
Yeah, I don't know my hell is not doing anything about it Whoa I'm shooting my first.

396
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:11,570
She's gonna get killed.

397
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,450
I was over here.

398
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:17,410
Oh Clearly you're not doing enough.

399
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:18,710
Oh, I'm frozen.

400
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:23,550
Oh my god, we did it.

401
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,550
We killed him.

402
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,170
I'll give it to our Namor.

403
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:28,690
I think our Namor deserves it more.

404
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,970
He got the kill, so he gets the reward.

405
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:39,490
He gets the good boy, the good boy flake.

406
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:43,750
To be fair, our Namor is the one that's doing the most stuff.

407
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:45,410
What?

408
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:46,570
We need healing.

409
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:48,570
I'll paint it, I'll paint it.

410
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:51,810
Oh no.

411
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:57,450
Oh no, guys.

412
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:04,370
You got him.

413
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:06,890
I think it's happening.

414
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,510
They're all hell out of nowhere.

415
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:14,490
I gotta whisper it now.

416
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:20,990
I think I might have gotten neighbors.

417
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,150
Oh, where is he?

418
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:30,170
Oh shit.

419
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:34,490
I'm coming over, I'm coming over.

420
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:43,290
Get shit on.

421
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:44,790
Get shit on.

422
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:45,130
Get shit on.

423
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:49,590
I have my neighbors very angry right now inside my door.

424
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:51,230
Good grief, Luna.

425
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:55,150
Luna on the side.

426
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:02,490
Oh no, I can't just leave.

427
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:03,570
I'm in a game.

428
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:06,490
I'm in a game.

429
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:08,810
Just so easy.

430
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:15,070

Actually, no, I can.

440

They don't have support for now.

00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:58,450
I have to soundproof my room now.

442
00:42:58,970 --> 00:42:59,730

It's like a year and a half.

455
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:50,010
I've been here for a year and a half.

456
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:55,590
I've done D-Gen hours and I've never had a complaint before at this time.

457
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:59,730
And I swear to God, I've been so loud.

458
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:05,510
I've been so loud before.

459
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:08,910
I didn't realize how, yeah, I didn't realize how loud.

460
00:47:09,050 --> 00:48:23,770
If I fucking hear them knocking on my door, the thing is i'm also like in the game so i can't take the i can't leave because i don't want to get reported so i guess i gotta i gotta figure out how to sound proof because like if they start complaining during my regular hours then it's a problem i understand if it's like at this time i understand because like i said it's five in the morning so like that sense you know like maybe they were sleeping and then i was i'm too loud i feel like yeah not getting reported by me that's true not getting reported in game um no it has to be an it has to be a noise complaint because like they've never i've never got someone knocking on my door outside before other than for like um also fool thank you for the raid thank you thank you we're just dealing with a noise complaint i'm it's like when when super had to like when super got um kicked out because he was too he got new neighbors he got new neighbors and then apparently he also got kicked out of his

461
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:38,990
apartment um because they filed a noise complaint against yeah yeah like he had to find like a house or something to live in um because like uh because his he got new neighbors as well and then they also he got kicked out yeah

462
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:57,430
also see they give her gifting a tier one so it's a noisy ridiculous thank you i'm gonna also the thing is my door's not locked so i'm gonna go lock my door in case they barge

463
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:08,810
my door's not locked they were like knocking on my door i didn't know my door's not locked

464
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:15,810
I guess I'm like, no one's going to come into my apartment.

465
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:18,970
Like, okay, give me a sec.

466
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:21,450
I got to start locking my door, guys.

467
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:07,310
Okay.

468
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:08,770
Adu.

469
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:15,350
I wonder what we're going to do.

470
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:17,230
I'm too trusting.

471
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:17,950
Adu.

472
00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:25,730
There's no one outside my, there's no one outside my, my apartment right now.

473
00:50:25,950 --> 00:51:53,720
i'm so sad i'm so sad i love playing dgen fuse too they're my favorite type of fuse because you can encounter you can encounter so many wild okay i need actually i need to avoid the the hella that was that was uninspiring i'm sorry but that was that was such an uninspiring game from our hella it was it was so sad so i i got avoid him i don't i can't believe it i'm so dead i forgot to soundproof this room this is why i wanted to move too because my my streaming room is like too close to the door i think if like i think if my room was uh uh no i'm pretty sure it's like it's basically because i'm too loud like like they weren't because dad wasn't barking he wasn't barking um until they started knocking on the door that's when he started barking because obviously he's like what the fuck is that you know he's like what is that like who's that outside the door um but it's definitely because I was too loud but like i never realized um i never realized that uh no i'm not assuming because they

474
00:51:53,720 --> 00:52:40,080
were literally knocking on my door in the middle of my like while i was streaming and and dad wasn't barking he wasn't barking until they knocked like three times and it was like super loud knocking i don't know if you guys heard the knocking but it was like really loud knocking and then dad started freaking out because he was like um he was like what the was that like like why why is he letting them knock on her door um yeah and it's like if they can hear me um if they can hear me like from my streaming room in their apartment then i just need a sound like what else can i do i can all i could do is just soundproof my room you know like if i talk to them they're just gonna be Like,

475
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:41,480
what's that going to solve?

476
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:43,360
Like, I'll be like, oh, sorry.

477
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:46,420
Let me, like, I can't be like, sorry, I'm a streamer.

478
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,140
Also, I don't want to tell them that, like, I'm a streamer.

479
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:50,620
This is my job, you know?

480
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:54,720
I don't have to, no.

481
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:59,820
It's a logical, like, at that point, they might even put up more complaints.

482
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,280
Because they're like, oh, like, you know.

483
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:08,400
They'll, like, be like, you can only stream at least hours or some shit.

484
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,540
And I don't want my neighbors to control, like, what time I stream.

485
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:18,920
Yeah, because they'll be like, oh, you streamed, like, you stream, like, outside of your scheduled hours.

486
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:24,600
I rather just get the soundproofing in, and then they'll never have to, like, if I, they'll never have to, no.

487
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:29,880
Yeah, but why else would I be fucking shouting at five in the, it's, like, literally my job.

488
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:30,500
They're like, just stop.

489
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,160
If I be like, oh, I'm just playing video games.

490
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,660
Like, don't play video games at this time, you know?

491
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:36,580
They'll just say that, shit like that.

492
00:53:42,300 --> 00:54:11,480
you have to buy a house um bro houses here are so expensive i'll just soundproof the place i might i might like i'll look into like like in the end like the logical conclusion in the end is only sure what the like wait why are you oh wait you're always in a dgen time never mind Do you see here that Gully wants to bring back the old Fortnite crew sure for?

493
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:17,320
And then we were watching the Ice Spice clip.

494
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:25,100
He wants to bring back the squad.

495
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:32,730
What do you mean?

496
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:34,570
Did you not see the new update?

497
00:54:34,810 --> 00:54:36,750
The new Simpsons update, bro?

498
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:40,150
For those who've never seen the clip, let me show you guys.

499
00:54:42,710 --> 00:55:00,910
sent we were like reminiscing about fortnight how can you say fortnight sucks when we had this magical clip together I love

500
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:15,180
I love the title she a baddie this is such a good clip I love this clip so much all

501
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:31,270
right maybe the game won't be as bad now.

502
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:35,010
How much have you spent on Fortnite?

503
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:40,150
Who's keeping count?

504
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:53,260
Who even is aware?

505
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:57,960
You'll need a top-notch team to win this one.

506
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:02,500
Who keeps track of how much money people spend on gotcha, huh?

507
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:06,960
If I don't judge you for your gotcha, you don't judge me for Fortnite.

508
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,140
Okay, I need to give him a tree.

509
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:12,740
Alright, give me a second.

510
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:15,100
Oh, shit.

511
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,120
Alright, my slipper got caught on the head go fire.

512
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,000
Round one!

513
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:39,640
Even when the multiverse is in danger, family still comes first.

514
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:41,120
30 seconds before you attack.

515
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:41,960
Get ready.

516
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:43,780
I hate when that happens.

517
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:47,040
I always, like, drop my headphones.

518
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:48,540
Oh, my sweet Susan Storm.

519
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,080
It's Richard's name.

520
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:52,500
As you are...

522
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:27,460
This is like still not lit.

523
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:29,300
Jesus Christ.

524
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:31,800
This is so hard to heal.

525
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:37,760
Why are you trying, please?

526
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:40,520
I'm so sad because...

527
00:57:45,110 --> 00:57:50,390
Bro, I almost... I was gonna pull the penny down and then he fucking stuns him.

528
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:54,450
Ah yes, the flank... the front.

529
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:55,470
Lion Widow.

530
00:57:56,370 --> 00:57:57,950
Yeah, this might not be enough, yes.

531
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:02,050
This absolutely is not enough, yes.

532
00:58:05,430 --> 00:58:08,250
Okay, I was gonna say I better kill him.

533
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:15,650
I should not be playing Invis with this comp.

534
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:20,270
I don't have enough, like, bodies to charge my... Oh!

535
00:58:21,350 --> 00:58:22,250
Did they dodge?

536
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:24,030
Oh, somebody dodged.

537
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:24,450
Thank god.

538
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:25,050
God.

539
00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:26,990
Thank fucking God.

540
00:58:27,650 --> 00:58:28,310
Fuck my team.

541
00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:34,690
I'm happy.

542
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:36,430
Fuck my team.

543
00:58:36,970 --> 00:58:38,330
I'm glad they're gone.

544
00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:41,770
I didn't close my door, though.

545
00:58:42,050 --> 00:58:42,590
I'm safe.

546
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:46,530
Someone was like, I am playing this game at five in the morning.

547
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:48,370
And rightfully so.

548
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:49,530
Rightfully so.

549
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:51,530
I don't think anyone wants to play that game at five in the

550
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:23,850
Yeah, I'm in a soundproofing Take I most likely will hire someone I do not trust myself You guys are ready If you guys watched my first Today's stream If you guys watched today's stream You guys can tell already Or like yesterday's stream How bad my DIY Project was Or DIY

551
00:59:28,170 --> 00:59:34,390
My DIY project was So bad I definitely need to hire someone.

552
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:39,230
Yeah, yeah.

553
00:59:39,530 --> 00:59:40,870
Okay, I'll show you guys.

554
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:44,210
For those who didn't watch the sponsor stream, because, you know, you're like, oh, it's sponsored.

555
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:46,770
Like, it's sponsored.

556
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:50,490
But basically, I'll show you guys the picture.

557
00:59:51,410 --> 01:00:01,550
So, long story short, I was trying to get a base station from a...

558
01:00:01,690 --> 01:00:32,710
VR or VR set up and I didn't have a mount to do it yeah no it's tape it's tape so I forgot to order a mount to place my face station which is like the little square thing that people use to do VR tracking and stuff for your VR headset so but it has to be on the wall and my brilliant idea use foam,

559
01:00:32,950 --> 01:00:39,690
my audio foam, but you see this up top above here, you see the thing on top here, um, the thing at the top right here, that's a vent.

560
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:46,890
And what I didn't know is that, you know, silly me, um, hot air melts.

561
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:54,330
So this is what's supposed to, this is what my plan was to put the, to use audio foam because it, because you need to.

562
01:00:55,070 --> 01:01:01,610
And I, it works on the other side and still holding up, by the way, the other side, um, I put an audio phone on there.

563
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:32,710
and I put the base station up top on top of it because I was like okay I didn't buy a mount this is like my next brilliant idea so um obviously I figured it should work on the other side too yes it's it's gorilla tape it's gorilla tape so it's very strong tape so what I didn't realize is that hot air melts tape melts the sticky the adhesive for tape so when I put the foam there and I put the base station on top of it,

564
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:35,130
it fell like three times.

565
01:01:35,390 --> 01:01:36,870
And I was like, what do I do?

566
01:01:36,990 --> 01:01:38,650
And I was like panicking because I had my sponsor.

567
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:40,250
Like, what do I do?

568
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:43,350
So what I did instead

569
01:01:46,770 --> 01:02:00,530
was what I did was I grabbed a microphone box that I still kept and I smashed it against the wall and it worked.

570
01:02:04,330 --> 01:02:38,010
box over audio foam um and and that is why yeah see this is my do it yourself DIY so this I like I said I don't trust myself on DIY projects um because this is what's my solution on on how to how to mount because I forgot to buy I forgot to buy the wall mounts So I don't know if it's cheaper

571
01:02:41,150 --> 01:03:31,310
There's nothing to do with being good at streaming It's just I was MacGyvering that shit though It worked It worked though It's unrelated to streaming it was a bonus I mean we're gonna do hammer crossing I'm gonna do an hammer cross fuck it I'll keep playing Luna yeah I'm thinking outside of the box with a box um but yeah um so with that that's why I should hire someone to do the soundproof thing because I don't know like that took me by the it.

572
01:03:31,910 --> 01:03:33,450
Doing all of that took me three hours.

573
01:03:37,350 --> 01:03:39,590
There was a lot of trial and error.

574
01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:44,230
It was no, you know, there was a lot of trial and error.

575
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:59,330
Before we before I fell into the conclusion that box is the answer.

576
01:04:00,730 --> 01:04:08,850
It took me three hours to be like ah yes a box it took three hours to tape a box to go up

577
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:18,860
you'll need a top-notch team to win this one i'm gonna snow put this on our captain america

578
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:34,930
i don't feel very inspired right now i think i like oh we don't have the silo yeah three hours and also lots of crying you're right there was that too

579
01:04:38,030 --> 01:04:42,590
Yeah, after it fell twice, the foam, I was like, let me try it one more time.

580
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:52,830
Yeah, but the thing is, if I build a soundproof roof, it's gonna be even hotter in this room.

581
01:04:52,990 --> 01:04:55,270
And I don't fucking want to deal with that.

582
01:04:57,570 --> 01:04:59,110
30 seconds before you attack.

583
01:04:59,430 --> 01:04:59,950
Get ready.

584
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:06,180
This sucks.

585
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:08,540
Fucking new neighbors.

586
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:54,920

588
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:30,580
i missed my non-confront confrontional confrontional oh my confrontinal non-confrontional no that's not how you say it you just didn't like confronting me if they were old neighbors and they just let me be i miss them i forced them to move out but at least non-confrontational non-confrontational yes yes

01:06:58,020 --> 01:06:58,680
Yeah, we...

596
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:00,220
This team is not...

597
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:02,300
Yeah, oh my god.

598
01:07:10,590 --> 01:07:12,850
Someone needs a snowball in the face.

599
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:14,430
Yeah, pumpkin.

600
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:16,650
Yeah, he's the Halloween skin.

601
01:07:17,130 --> 01:07:18,490
Oh, now we have Angela.

602
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:23,890
Yesterday, last stream, I won every game.

603
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:26,770
This stream, it's not doing so well.

604
01:07:28,730 --> 01:07:30,450
I'm getting actual...

605
01:07:30,450 --> 01:07:32,870
I was supposed to be the EOMM agent.

606
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:34,530
I don't understand.

607
01:07:37,910 --> 01:07:39,850
Oh, there we go.

608
01:07:40,030 --> 01:07:41,790
Yeah, I was gonna say, you need it all at first.

609
01:07:41,930 --> 01:07:42,910
It should not be me.

610
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:49,470
Okay, I guess I do the damage.

611
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:55,340
Hello, Angela.

612
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:58,360
I'm a little scared, Angela.

613
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:02,940
Alright, here you go.

614
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:06,980
I do have up, so...

615
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:08,560
I gotta make sure I don't get grabbed.

616
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:11,140
Aw!

617
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:14,300
That's unlucky.

618
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:14,720
Oh!

619
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:19,100
Hey, guys, there is one little boy here.

620
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:22,080
I don't think I should have used my up there.

621
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:24,120
I got a little scared.

622
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:28,740
Oh yeah, no, I definitely fucked up by using a...

623
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:30,480
Because he still has...

624
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:31,980
Oh, nice.

625
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:35,360
Unless I didn't fuck up.

626
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:35,620
Oh.

627
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:38,060
Okay.

628
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:41,440
What the fuck?

629
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:43,940
Did he use that to escape, bro?

630
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:46,380
You know, he tried to get a clip.

631
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:47,860
That's understandable, you know?

632
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:49,120
He tried to get a clip.

633
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:53,280
Oh my god, I swear to god.

634
01:08:53,620 --> 01:08:55,760
Oh my god, I swear to god.

635
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:58,700
Oh my...

636
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:05,180
The EOMM Give us and the EOMM Take it.

637
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:07,220
Oh, it was just Bucky.

638
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:10,380
Nothing to worry about.

639
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:13,340
Just our little Bucky, boy.

640
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:16,060
What the fuck?

641
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:47,320
Oh my god, he literally kidnapped uh, kidnapped or bucky just for him to get a 3k that's sad okay we have all for strange thank you i feel like myself again now he's doing it for widow because our widow will actually be non-existent if it wasn't for a mantis like like you might think he's non-existent now but like he could have been like even worse i know it's crazy that's like possible oh they still have

642
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:55,820
The only way I know how, because we can't take any damage.

643
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:58,440
Oh, I gotta move back.

644
01:09:59,020 --> 01:09:59,720
Is that strange?

645
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:01,580
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

646
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:03,340
Oh, thank god, okay.

647
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:04,820
Oh my.

648
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:08,440
Okay, I legitimately thought he was gonna...

649
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:11,440
Okay, I thought he was gonna...

650
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:15,060
Honestly, if the Strange Ulti 3, it would have been so smart for him.

651
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:19,780
Oh, I keep forgetting I have only Mantis here.

652
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:22,100
So I can't, like, front and die.

653
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:27,360
What if I...

654
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:27,840
There you go.

655
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:29,100
I don't know.

656
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:30,200
I didn't trust him.

657
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:36,440
It's sort of hard to...

658
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:39,720
To trust people in this Elo, you know?

659
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:41,960
Oh, there it is.

660
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:42,900
Goodbye.

661
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:47,500
I will say, I wasn't gonna live regardless.

662
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:49,340
If I had a...

663
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:56,580
Because, like, we had GM players, so I don't trust them to...

664
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:59,220
I don't trust them to counter Jeff.

665
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:10,440
It's very hard to trust GM players to throw a rock on a Jeff.

666
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:17,820
Also, like, trusting people in matchmaking is, like, not it.

667
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:22,720
God, I feel so nerfed.

668
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:23,920
What the fuck?

669
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:28,260
Oh my god, he did more stuff without...

670
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:29,300
That's actually crazy.

671
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:32,740
He was more useful without a fucking mantis.

672
01:11:39,850 --> 01:11:40,570
Oh.

673
01:11:41,450 --> 01:11:42,530
That's bad.

674
01:11:43,670 --> 01:11:44,770
Oh, that's bad.

675
01:11:44,910 --> 01:11:46,250
Oh, that's very bad.

676
01:11:48,950 --> 01:11:49,570
Bro.

677
01:11:51,590 --> 01:11:53,170
I I don't know.

678
01:11:53,370 --> 01:11:54,590
I'm I'm trying here.

679
01:11:54,590 --> 01:11:54,830
Oh

680
01:11:58,390 --> 01:12:00,990
Why why did you throw?

681
01:12:09,410 --> 01:12:30,490
He actually threw He threw me He fed me The terror store is One two zero He actually Spend me Including which side you're That's crazy.

682
01:12:31,310 --> 01:12:33,490
Who are you calling a raccoon, huh?

683
01:12:33,650 --> 01:12:35,870
The right heroes could make all the difference.

684
01:12:37,570 --> 01:12:39,210
He threw three of us.

685
01:12:39,510 --> 01:12:40,930
He ate all three.

686
01:12:41,030 --> 01:12:45,850
I told you guys, this is why I don't trust my teammate.

687
01:12:46,510 --> 01:12:49,870
This is why I'm not the type who fades quietly into the background.

688
01:12:50,170 --> 01:12:50,910
I told you.

689
01:12:53,690 --> 01:12:55,770
I fucking told you.

690
01:12:56,090 --> 01:12:57,490
I can't trust me.

691
01:12:57,670 --> 01:12:59,170
I can't trust Gia.

692
01:12:59,290 --> 01:12:59,630
players.

693
01:13:00,930 --> 01:13:05,510
I don't think he understood that he chucked all of us into the enemy team.

694
01:13:05,690 --> 01:13:07,450
He was like, really only one I could eat.

695
01:13:07,790 --> 01:13:12,150
But he doesn't understand that he, he chucked.

696
01:13:12,510 --> 01:13:17,050
You're just mad that you're... He's so stupid.

697
01:13:17,650 --> 01:13:18,870
He's actually special.

698
01:13:19,490 --> 01:13:20,490
He's so stupid.

699
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:23,710
Didn't ask.

700
01:13:29,850 --> 01:13:36,130
No, no, no, no, no, no.

701
01:13:36,130 --> 01:13:38,050
Oh, this is dead.

702
01:13:38,390 --> 01:13:38,990
Come on, no.

703
01:13:38,990 --> 01:13:42,710
Oh, I hate it.

704
01:13:42,810 --> 01:13:43,310
I hate it.

705
01:13:43,710 --> 01:13:44,750
I have to be so careful.

706
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:49,330
Now it's not like that.

707
01:13:53,490 --> 01:13:55,770
I think I prefer him on Mantis.

708
01:13:56,390 --> 01:14:00,150
I, yeah, no, I definitely prefer my, I prefer him on Mantis.

709
01:14:00,150 --> 01:14:31,660
we're running triple there you go that should help there you go okay we're on triple tank now it should work right but are they on triple oh they're on triple they were on triple I didn't even notice that guys I think we should leave guys guys guys why the fuck should we all push up

710
01:14:35,620 --> 01:14:39,620
Yes, I think Emma doesn't have mobility.

711
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:42,680
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

712
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:45,300
And who was it that did the push?

713
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:48,660
Like, Jeff, you were not doing anything.

714
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:52,340
What the fuck do you mean to sit?

715
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:55,220
What did you provide in that fight?

716
01:15:01,790 --> 01:15:04,730
I have no idea if my team is saved or not.

717
01:15:05,210 --> 01:15:05,710
There you go.

718
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:09,110
Oh, yummy, yummy.

719
01:15:10,430 --> 01:15:11,870
Oh, okay.

720
01:15:12,610 --> 01:15:13,830
Okay, Jeff.

721
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:16,390
Oh, okay.

722
01:15:16,990 --> 01:15:18,750
We are down three.

723
01:15:21,390 --> 01:15:22,350
How did he know?

724
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:29,580
Oh my, no, our Jeff is special.

725
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,720
Our Jeff is like, our Jeff is so special.

726
01:15:33,740 --> 01:15:38,860
He doesn't know how to place Jeff.

727
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:44,320
Like, I can't defend this.

728
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:46,920
Where's our Jeff, by the way?

729
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:49,380
Oh, there it is.

730
01:15:51,860 --> 01:15:52,900
I'm like...

731
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:55,440
It's fine, I pushed him away.

732
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:59,160
Okay, but who's gonna help me though?

733
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:00,400
There we go.

734
01:16:03,140 --> 01:16:04,500
I just... what?

735
01:16:06,860 --> 01:16:07,860
Okay, same guy.

736
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:11,480
Thank God.

737
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:12,300
Okay, he's fine.

738
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:20,360
I mean, we didn't start them.

739
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:22,520
There we go.

740
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:24,500
Holy fuck.

741
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:29,080
No, this Jeff is my EOMM agent.

742
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:30,600
No, 100%.

743
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:33,220
I don't even know how we're alive.

744
01:16:36,580 --> 01:16:38,040
They have two fights.

745
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:40,360
God, I hate Triple T, though.

746
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:42,560
Oh, at least we're...

747
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:42,840
Oh, wait.

748
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:43,740
They got off Triple T.

749
01:16:43,820 --> 01:16:44,160
Nice.

750
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:51,580
I feel so nerfed knowing that I have to be who would have thought you got to be quiet at five in the morning

01:16:55,220 --> 01:17:00,160

He...

755
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:25,780
He did not do a good eat.

756
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:32,380
He...

757
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:32,880
He...

758
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:34,600
He did not do a good eat.

759
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:35,800
He really...

760
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:38,300

01:18:27,660 --> 01:18:30,200
Why can't R-Strange be good like that?

767
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,380
Also, why can't we have that death too?

01:19:05,970 --> 01:19:05,970
Yeah.

774
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:07,850
I was gonna say I could use my other tent.

775
01:19:08,050 --> 01:19:08,170
Oh!

776
01:19:09,210 --> 01:19:09,930

01:19:20,310 --> 01:19:22,290

780
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:23,330

01:19:24,850 --> 01:19:26,330
Mr. Cleo, thank you for the raid?

783
01:19:26,370 --> 01:19:28,630
I have to be really quiet because I got a noise complaint.

784
01:19:29,010 --> 01:19:33,130
Because for some reason, people don't like it when you're loud at 5.

785
01:19:33,150 --> 01:20:05,900

We have two tanks in it that has a fucking shield.

787
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:17,180
One is diamond and the other one is a actual shield in war.

788
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:20,560
It's made of Vibranium.

789
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:23,860
That's okay.

790
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:25,720
It's not okay, but that's okay.

791
01:20:27,020 --> 01:20:29,620
We just had too many tank players apparently.

792
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:31,940
Oh, this is not good.

793
01:20:32,860 --> 01:20:34,320
This is not good.

794
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:37,060
I heard that portal and I knew.

795
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:41,800
I hate it.

796
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:42,640
Oh, I hate it.

797
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:44,460
It was a silent portal too.

798
01:20:47,420 --> 01:20:47,940
Wait, what?

799
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:50,980

Wait, I won?

805
01:21:23,950 --> 01:21:25,230
We did not deserve that.

806
01:21:25,370 --> 01:21:28,770
We 100% did not deserve that one.

807
01:21:29,670 --> 01:21:29,770
Yay!

808
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:34,380
This is Celestio slash TM.

809
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:38,040
A tier below, one below eternity.

810
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:39,340
No.

811
01:21:39,780 --> 01:21:40,220
No.

812
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:47,460
No.

813
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:51,080
Oh my god.

814
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:52,380
Trying to make sure you don't.

817
01:23:01,620 --> 01:23:03,680
What the fuck is going on?

818
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:06,260
Oh yeah, no, they all went.

819
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:08,200

820
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:09,140
Okay, yep.

821
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:10,320
They all ran.

822
01:23:19,490 --> 01:23:21,370
Okay, so that's what happened.

823
01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:22,370
There's the point.

824
01:23:23,710 --> 01:23:23,990
Alright.

825
01:23:24,430 --> 01:23:32,010
Oh yeah, and like two of them are here and The other three are in the pro.

826
01:23:32,170 --> 01:23:33,370
It was two people.

827
01:23:34,550 --> 01:23:36,090
Only two of us were alive.

828
01:23:36,810 --> 01:23:38,050
I was like, what?

829
01:23:38,230 --> 01:23:41,410
I thought the point, like, I was like, wasn't the point over here?

830
01:23:41,610 --> 01:23:42,770
How did we lose?

831
01:23:44,450 --> 01:23:49,370
Because obviously, we all know my team was the worst team.

832
01:23:49,830 --> 01:23:53,030
So I was like, I was like, wait, day one?

833
01:23:53,270 --> 01:23:54,970
I thought the point was over there.

834
01:23:56,450 --> 01:23:57,630
And I was right.

835
01:23:59,070 --> 01:23:59,370
What?

836
01:24:02,590 --> 01:24:03,830
That's crazy.

837
01:24:04,010 --> 01:24:05,390
We did not deserve that.

838
01:24:06,010 --> 01:24:11,590
Their team was, they had a better tank, they have a better strange, they had the better Jeff.

839
01:24:12,490 --> 01:24:15,470
Like, they all just walked up.

840
01:24:16,850 --> 01:24:22,730
Yeah, my Jeff was actively helping their team as much as possible.

841
01:24:22,970 --> 01:24:27,910
Like he was, he got the PayPal money and he still won.

842
01:24:29,350 --> 01:24:30,030
All right.

843
01:24:31,370 --> 01:24:32,770
Fuck, I want to play more.

844
01:24:33,090 --> 01:24:34,250
I'm so sad.

845
01:24:35,890 --> 01:24:37,230
I want to play more.

846
01:24:37,590 --> 01:24:39,570
The thing is, okay, here's the worst part.

847
01:24:40,390 --> 01:24:44,590
You guys are like, why don't you just get a blanket and put it under your door for soundproofing?

848
01:24:44,990 --> 01:24:56,150
But I can't because I have a sliding door, which is the worst type of door, which is absolutely the worst type of door to soundproof because it's a sliding door.

849
01:24:56,950 --> 01:24:59,010
And it's a glass, like it's a glass.

850
01:24:59,070 --> 01:25:28,650
sliding door and so I if I put a blanket underneath I still have to worry about the other other crevices around my door all right I our Jeff did not deserve MVP there and also who is this strange it was him right toast chat no who the fuck was our strange this guy was always Captain America right yeah no this guy this guy you were not a great strange

851
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:39,260
all right one more one more i'll do one more if i hear knocking then like i'm blaming you guys not me

852
01:25:45,020 --> 01:25:53,320
tuck it in where i gotta get tape okay there's no way to tuck it it's literally a sliding door on the outside

853
01:25:56,820 --> 01:26:04,120
all right it's not my fault if i get kicked out if i get kicked out i'm sending you the bill for my moving fee

854
01:26:10,650 --> 01:26:15,110
I don't, oh wait, I do, though the closet is not going to fit my streaming setup.

855
01:26:17,690 --> 01:26:18,130
100%.

856
01:26:19,970 --> 01:26:22,230
My setup is too big for a closet.

857
01:26:22,730 --> 01:26:24,130
Technically, this is a closet.

858
01:26:24,910 --> 01:26:25,530
I don't know.

859
01:26:25,570 --> 01:26:28,230
I don't know if it's supposed to be a closet or like a bedroom.

860
01:26:29,150 --> 01:26:30,190
I have no idea.

861
01:26:30,890 --> 01:26:32,490
But I made it into my office.

862
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:39,380
I didn't even realize I was yelling that loud.

863
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:55,580
that passionate about my team my team was so bad and it was the first you guys don't understand my first team my first game today was that bad my first game they were not real people

864
01:27:03,950 --> 01:27:17,330
just keep taping soundproofing on the walls until the complaints stop yeah it was so bad that i got my very first noise complaint that wasn't related to my dog

865
01:27:30,010 --> 01:28:46,850
but to be fair um i don't think like i don't know if that was my neighbors knocking or my concierge because like the first time it was my concierge that like knocked the door because like they went to the concierge to tell me i think i fought the con usually concierge doesn't check in until uh he doesn't check in until like later on because it's just a security guys a concierge it's just the person at the lobby that runs the lobby at the front but yeah oh yeah please feel free to um please please please yeah i'm sorry i can't english please feel free to nominate me for best marble rival streamer i am risking my apartment for this nomination with the streamer awards guys i really appreciate it yeah yeah yeah just put the okie bird for best marvel rival streamer no next week okay also like this week i might i'm gonna do the soundproofing next week because i'm like like obviously like um um i was planning on on like uh doing soundproofing anyway uh but like before i had the noise

866
01:28:46,850 --> 01:29:20,750
complaint because like you know dad's been barking a lot lately so i was just thinking of just like um getting that sorted out um and so because this week is super packed right this is super packed so obviously i can't do anything um because like my tires i don't even know if i have rest days at all today uh this week but um sat sunday and monday i might i'm gonna work on like setting everything up or or like hiring a person to uh to do the soundproofing have you just tried no Have you ever tried asking a weaner dog to not bark?

867
01:29:21,830 --> 01:29:23,330
That's like almost impossible.

868
01:29:23,850 --> 01:29:31,030
I think weaner dogs or like doxins are like the one of the most brattiest and stubborn dog breeds out there.

869
01:29:31,510 --> 01:29:34,470
But God, I've owned like three generations of them.

870
01:29:37,930 --> 01:29:39,910
Yeah, they are like one of the most...

871
01:29:39,910 --> 01:29:41,250
They have the second...

872
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:42,710
Yeah, they're born to be loud.

873
01:29:42,790 --> 01:29:43,870
They have the...

874
01:29:43,870 --> 01:29:44,990
I have...

875
01:29:44,990 --> 01:29:47,870
They have the second loudest barks out of all breeds.

876
01:29:48,390 --> 01:29:50,530
Because they were bred to hunt badgers.

877
01:29:52,110 --> 01:29:53,590
Yeah, he's very stubborn.

878
01:29:54,550 --> 01:29:55,110
It's the fucking...

879
01:29:55,110 --> 01:29:55,750
I go on her.

880
01:29:56,270 --> 01:29:57,430
Like, he knows now.

881
01:29:57,490 --> 01:30:07,730
And the fact that he knows that, like, ever since I got my first noise complaint at 10.30 a.m., um, he fucking knows that, like, he runs the apartment now.

882
01:30:08,270 --> 01:30:10,190
I guess before I would just let him bark.

883
01:30:10,550 --> 01:30:12,390
I would just let him bark and be like, no.

884
01:30:12,590 --> 01:30:13,770
Like, go do your thing.

885
01:30:13,870 --> 01:30:14,550
Like, I don't care.

886
01:30:14,690 --> 01:30:16,790
Like, you ain't getting food early.

887
01:30:18,870 --> 01:30:33,110
that like I'm worried about getting kicked out he's like he's like you play by my rules now it's yeah he owns he's the man of the apartment see

888
01:30:36,210 --> 01:31:15,990
I know he is that hello whoa hey guys just want to show whoa yeah he's blackmailing you know he is and he knows it he fucking knows it he is blackmailing me so on sunday and monday most likely no stream uh next week because i gotta figure out the sound proving shit so if i do sound weird on tuesday it's because i'm still getting the shit worked out i sound fucking weird on tuesday

01:31:26,970 --> 01:31:30,790
I actually feeling, I'm feeling, I'm feeling so rivals right now.

01:31:31,410 --> 01:31:32,150
I really am.

894
01:31:32,830 --> 01:31:34,650
I'm getting my rivals itch.

895
01:31:43,780 --> 01:31:48,240
This might mean I have to stream rivals at like less of a D-Gen hour.

896
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:57,140
I might have to, I might have to stream rivals maybe at like 9 p.m.

897
01:31:57,140 --> 01:31:58,100

I don't even, thank God I went raccoon.

931
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:39,740
See, this is why I've stopped playing other carry supports.

932
01:34:41,700 --> 01:35:13,960

933
01:35:14,540 --> 01:35:15,340
Yeah, it is.

934
01:35:15,780 --> 01:35:18,240
Um, there is like a guy beating us up.

935
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:20,980
Can't even put out a res.

936
01:35:21,340 --> 01:35:23,280
Like, where the fuck do I put out the res?

937
01:35:23,700 --> 01:35:24,460
Not gonna, oh.

938
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:26,180
Oh, that's awkward.

939
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:29,860
That's, that's very awkward.

940
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:34,340
I feel they're really bad.

941
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:36,760
I feel like we just have to run an animal crossing.

942
01:35:37,060 --> 01:35:37,300
Yeah, man.

943
01:35:38,260 --> 01:35:39,220
Not like, yo.

944
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:39,580
Yeah.

945
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:47,300
Oh, I forgot about this guy.

946
01:35:49,300 --> 01:35:50,960
It's okay, we wait, made it.

947
01:35:51,420 --> 01:35:52,880
It's okay, you wasted...

948
01:35:53,660 --> 01:35:55,620
You wasted Phoenix out, guys.

949
01:35:57,320 --> 01:35:57,680
Look at that.

950
01:35:57,780 --> 01:36:00,400
My old was actually pretty badly positioned.

951
01:36:01,860 --> 01:36:02,080
What?

952
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:03,920
No, what?

953
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:08,640
It's okay, guys, look at that.

954
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:09,700
It was planned.

955
01:36:10,260 --> 01:36:10,920
It was planned.

956
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:12,080
What the fuck?

957
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:15,620
I wanted him to use the phoenix up.

958
01:36:16,420 --> 01:36:17,880
Oh my god.

959
01:36:20,020 --> 01:36:21,220
What the fuck?

960
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:26,100
Bro, what are we doing there?

961
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:26,280
What?

962
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:30,300
Let me try my best to keep you up.

963
01:36:32,740 --> 01:36:34,460
Oh, so again.

964
01:36:35,260 --> 01:36:35,660
Bye.

965
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:37,820
Oh my god.

966
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:39,280
Oh my god, I'm alive.

967
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:41,380
Oh my god, I'm barely alive.

968
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:43,280
Goodbye!

969
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:46,600
I wanted the extra shield.

970
01:36:48,820 --> 01:36:50,720
What the fuck is going on?

971
01:36:51,940 --> 01:36:55,660
Oh wait, he sees my shield.

972
01:36:58,540 --> 01:37:01,980
I don't know how the fuck we live, but I'll take it.

973
01:37:05,700 --> 01:37:06,340
Oh?

974
01:37:06,340 --> 01:37:06,980
Sure.

975
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:08,860
Okay, never mind.

976
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:13,900
is all I can do.

977
01:37:13,980 --> 01:37:15,980
I don't know what I can do for this world.

978
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:19,980
I'm out here now in Hargorn.

979
01:37:22,940 --> 01:37:23,400
Oh yeah, no.

980
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:25,640
The Spider-Man definitely has a lot, by the way.

981
01:37:27,140 --> 01:37:27,860
Oh, nice.

982
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:29,520
Yeah?

983
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:30,660
Watch this.

984
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:31,980
Oh, I don't need to use it.

985
01:37:32,340 --> 01:37:32,640
JK.

986
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:34,460
Don't watch it.

987
01:37:34,580 --> 01:37:35,120
Oh, watch this.

988
01:37:35,220 --> 01:37:35,760
Watch this.

989
01:37:35,820 --> 01:37:36,320
Watch this.

990
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:36,460
Watch this.

991
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:36,880
Watch this.

992
01:37:37,020 --> 01:37:37,200
Watch this.

993
01:37:39,080 --> 01:37:40,220

See, you're back.

997
01:38:15,540 --> 01:38:16,560
Like, you never died.

998
01:38:18,620 --> 01:38:21,820
See, I could have been that poor guy right there.

999
01:38:22,780 --> 01:38:24,360
You got that poor Brandon guy.

1000
01:38:24,460 --> 01:38:25,040
You see that?

1001
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:26,480
That could have been me.

1002
01:38:29,080 --> 01:38:30,540
That could have been me, guys.

1003
01:38:30,680 --> 01:38:31,140
But look at me.

1004
01:38:31,180 --> 01:38:32,060
I'm chilling now.

1005
01:38:33,220 --> 01:38:33,840
But look at that.

1006
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:34,860
I'll get to chill.

1007
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:42,760
Why can't I reach Celestia playing?

1008
01:38:42,860 --> 01:38:45,580
this because you're clearly not playing like this

1009
01:38:49,000 --> 01:39:04,220
all it takes a lot of skill to play this bit of a raccoon player it takes a lot of work guys to right click this it takes so much work oh

1010
01:39:13,540 --> 01:39:14,160
Jerry's dead.

1011
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:18,340
Look, I was getting Dive, okay?

1012
01:39:19,180 --> 01:39:21,680
He literally, he soloed to me.

1013
01:39:22,300 --> 01:39:23,980
He was so scared of me.

1014
01:39:24,420 --> 01:39:26,080
Guys, he was so fucking scared.

1015
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:28,120
I don't know if you saw that, but he was so scared of me.

1016
01:39:28,420 --> 01:39:29,920
He had to solo up me.

1017
01:39:30,060 --> 01:39:31,240
That's so sad.

1018
01:39:32,280 --> 01:39:35,980
That's how- That's how scared he was.

1019
01:39:37,940 --> 01:39:38,280
Yeah.

1020
01:39:38,860 --> 01:39:40,040
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1021
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:48,560
Oh, is everyone okay over here?

1022
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:52,620
Oh, wait, who?

1023
01:39:53,060 --> 01:39:53,700
There he is.

1024
01:39:54,260 --> 01:39:55,620
Oh, oh, nice.

1025
01:39:56,980 --> 01:39:59,500
Oh, nice, nice.

1026
01:39:59,720 --> 01:40:00,000
I get...

1027
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:00,360
Oh, my God.

1028
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:01,600
In my wrist, Liz?

1029
01:40:01,740 --> 01:40:03,360
I don't think they look down once.

1030
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:04,140
Let's kill Brandon.

1031
01:40:04,380 --> 01:40:04,680
Let's kill Brandon.

1032
01:40:04,860 --> 01:40:06,240
Let's kill Brandon.

1033
01:40:06,340 --> 01:40:08,300
What the fuck did Brandon do to you?

1034
01:40:10,620 --> 01:40:11,320
Oh, shit.

1035
01:40:11,480 --> 01:40:12,540
They finally got the up.

1036
01:40:15,100 --> 01:40:15,760
behind me.

1037
01:40:16,540 --> 01:40:18,820
Oh, wait, did I pull it?

1038
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:19,580
Yeah, I pulled it.

1039
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:19,920
Okay.

1040
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:21,200
That's fine.

1041
01:40:22,620 --> 01:40:22,800
Oh,

1042
01:40:26,870 --> 01:40:27,170
yeah.

1043
01:40:27,350 --> 01:40:28,790
I died for the cause.

1044
01:40:30,370 --> 01:40:32,410
Okay, are they... Okay, I think I have to go over.

1045
01:40:33,450 --> 01:40:36,450
I was gonna say, are they not getting it?

1046
01:40:36,550 --> 01:40:37,090
Oh, they are.

1047
01:40:37,430 --> 01:40:40,850
All right, I gotta do the... I gotta do the walk of shame, guys.

1048
01:40:40,970 --> 01:40:41,450
Give me a sec.

1049
01:40:42,290 --> 01:40:43,850
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1050
01:40:44,730 --> 01:40:46,550
He's gonna find his children, too.

1051
01:40:46,950 --> 01:41:13,410

The walk got you.

1053
01:41:20,130 --> 01:41:21,050
Oh, not her though.

1054
01:41:21,230 --> 01:41:22,110
I was talking about her.

1055
01:41:23,330 --> 01:41:25,630
I got someone.

1056
01:41:26,090 --> 01:41:27,210
It's not this person.

1057
01:41:30,470 --> 01:41:31,310
Get rid of him.

1058
01:41:31,450 --> 01:41:33,010
Get rid of him.

1059
01:41:34,410 --> 01:41:35,830
Sorry, buddy.

1060
01:41:36,510 --> 01:41:41,050
I have to reload.

1061
01:41:41,530 --> 01:41:42,090
I live.

1062
01:41:45,430 --> 01:41:47,910
Rika, thank you for the Twitch Prime, thank you, thank you.

1063
01:41:50,410 --> 01:41:53,470
Bro, bro, bro's about to like get on a list.

1064
01:41:55,190 --> 01:41:57,050
This is actually a hate crime at that point.

1065
01:41:58,530 --> 01:41:59,530
Bro, is it like...

1066
01:41:59,530 --> 01:42:00,390
Oh my god, I need healing, man.

1067
01:42:01,010 --> 01:42:02,730
Bro, I haven't stopped right-clicking.

1068
01:42:02,870 --> 01:42:04,790
If I could, I'd just bind it on right-click.

1069
01:42:08,670 --> 01:42:09,110
Actually...

1070
01:42:09,110 --> 01:42:12,550
Okay, oh no, oh no, that's so unlucky.

1071
01:42:14,070 --> 01:42:15,350
That's so unlucky.

1072
01:42:17,270 --> 01:42:20,190
I forgot, I legitimately forgot if Phoenix was a person, was a character.

1073
01:42:21,870 --> 01:42:23,350
Oh, they double-supported all did.

1074
01:42:24,530 --> 01:42:31,450
Okay, I will say I forgot that Phoenix even existed because he was that, like, he was that non-existent in this game.

1075
01:42:33,730 --> 01:42:35,810
He did not exist for me.

1076
01:42:35,810 --> 01:42:37,090
Oh my god, that's okay.

1077
01:42:40,050 --> 01:42:41,090
I'm getting out of my arms.

1078
01:42:41,410 --> 01:42:42,170
Just stay on the phone.

1079
01:42:42,190 --> 01:42:42,650
Oh, please.

1080
01:42:49,350 --> 01:42:52,190
Oh, whoa, whoa.

1081
01:42:53,490 --> 01:42:53,730
Whoa.

1082
01:42:53,730 --> 01:42:53,950
Oh, wow.

1083
01:42:55,690 --> 01:42:56,650
Oh, wow.

1084
01:42:59,350 --> 01:43:01,490
Uh, Waluuru, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

1085
01:43:01,630 --> 01:43:02,270
Thank you.

1086
01:43:02,390 --> 01:43:02,710
Happy.

1087
01:43:02,950 --> 01:43:04,330
Thank you for the Twitch Prime.

1088
01:43:04,510 --> 01:43:06,010
Derpy, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

1089
01:43:06,170 --> 01:43:06,310
Thank you.

1090
01:43:06,670 --> 01:43:08,470
Yeah, no, I forgot he existed.

1091
01:43:09,190 --> 01:43:13,390
Like, the Phoenix had made zero, made like zero impact.

1092
01:43:13,410 --> 01:43:22,210
in the game that forgot about her i didn't realize he was real there we go now we do animal crossing

1093
01:43:36,490 --> 01:43:52,670
i just throw there by throwing my up when the phoenix tilted but to be fair i feel like if i didn't my team was gonna die because like our star lord star lord was literally like one hp you'll be coming in 30 seconds stay strong

1094
01:43:55,770 --> 01:43:57,370
I don't even know what this is.

1095
01:43:57,730 --> 01:43:57,910
Okay.

1096
01:43:58,370 --> 01:43:59,110
Oh no.

1097
01:44:01,370 --> 01:44:02,730
No, stop.

1098
01:44:05,830 --> 01:44:06,910
All right.

1099
01:44:07,610 --> 01:44:10,770
No, stop.

1100
01:44:11,230 --> 01:44:11,370
No.

1101
01:44:14,250 --> 01:44:14,350
No.

1102
01:44:14,690 --> 01:44:15,490
The battle starts in five.

1103
01:44:16,290 --> 01:44:16,570
All right.

1104
01:44:16,570 --> 01:44:18,850
Three, three, three, three.

1105
01:44:18,850 --> 01:44:19,150
All right.

1106
01:44:19,850 --> 01:44:22,430
I mean, to be fair, he is getting tired of you carrying Brandon.

1107
01:44:22,550 --> 01:44:23,430
You're ready for it.

1108
01:44:24,090 --> 01:44:25,750
It's all about Brandon.

1109
01:44:27,190 --> 01:44:28,510
There's nothing else.

1110
01:44:29,330 --> 01:44:38,750
I saved my fucking Hey, we got we got here.

1111
01:44:39,030 --> 01:44:46,710
We got res Hey guys, um Guys, did you at least get Brandon though?

1112
01:44:47,710 --> 01:44:48,110
Brandon's dead.

1113
01:44:48,230 --> 01:44:48,530
Brandon's dead.

1114
01:44:48,630 --> 01:44:49,270
Oh shit.

1115
01:44:49,470 --> 01:44:49,910
Brandon's dead.

1116
01:44:50,050 --> 01:44:50,650
We did it.

1117
01:44:50,650 --> 01:44:51,130
We did it.

1118
01:44:51,190 --> 01:44:51,370
No, no stop.

1119
01:44:51,530 --> 01:44:51,670
No, stop.

1120
01:44:53,090 --> 01:44:54,310
Guys, we did it.

1121
01:44:54,750 --> 01:44:55,350
Operation kill.

1122
01:44:55,570 --> 01:44:56,010
Oh, goodbye.

1123
01:44:57,570 --> 01:45:01,250
I think we have prob- I think we have- I don't think Brandon's the problem.

1124
01:45:01,950 --> 01:45:03,370
Why are we backing up, man?

1125
01:45:05,170 --> 01:45:10,930
I think at this point- I think at this point it's not a Brandon issue.

1126
01:45:11,070 --> 01:45:12,510
I think we got- guys, guys, I don't know.

1127
01:45:12,550 --> 01:45:17,990
This is a wild idea, but what if we focus on other players?

1128
01:45:18,290 --> 01:45:19,710
Oh, that's wild, isn't it?

1129
01:45:19,730 --> 01:45:20,230
I don't know.

1130
01:45:20,890 --> 01:45:22,490
I don't even know what I'm seeing.

1131
01:45:23,810 --> 01:45:25,010
But I don't know.

1132
01:45:25,010 --> 01:45:30,890
But what if we like, what if other other players exist too?

1133
01:45:31,230 --> 01:45:32,510
Isn't that crazy?

1134
01:45:34,850 --> 01:45:37,530
You sound like it's only Brandon.

1135
01:45:38,310 --> 01:45:40,990
Oh wait,

1136
01:45:48,020 --> 01:45:53,380
hello Hello, wait, what?

1137
01:45:54,380 --> 01:45:58,340
What the fuck is wrong?

1138
01:45:58,900 --> 01:46:01,760
There's no way you fall at this No, no, no, no, no.

1139
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:02,940
I don't want to hear it.

1140
01:46:03,080 --> 01:46:05,040
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1141
01:46:05,080 --> 01:46:05,920
What is wrong with me?

1142
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:06,820
He's a very...

1143
01:46:06,820 --> 01:46:07,300
That...

1144
01:46:07,300 --> 01:46:09,140
No, this guy was fucking terrible.

1145
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:10,500
How did he not kill me?

1146
01:46:10,860 --> 01:46:11,020
That's crazy.

1147
01:46:13,440 --> 01:46:16,380
I should not have been alive for that long.

1148
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:17,100
Wait, wait, wait.

1149
01:46:17,560 --> 01:46:18,400
I'm just fucking immortal.

1150
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:19,860
I can't kill him anymore.

1151
01:46:20,160 --> 01:46:21,120
Oh, our work condition is gone.

1152
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:27,100
There was no way that I actually lived that long.

1153
01:46:28,020 --> 01:46:30,140
That should have been illegal.

1154
01:46:31,120 --> 01:46:53,660
the thing is I can't use my because of the fucking because of the spawn man oh my God he's oh he's dead hey there is oh okay guys um

Wait, beta looking like I'm taking an ult.

1164
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:50,200
I never wanted to do that.

1165
01:47:51,020 --> 01:47:52,060
Not me!

1166
01:47:54,420 --> 01:47:54,940

01:48:04,540 --> 01:48:05,540
Oh my god, he knows.

1171
01:48:07,180 --> 01:48:10,260

01:48:12,620 --> 01:48:13,740
It's time.

1174
01:48:13,820 --> 01:48:16,140
Oh, I don't even need to use it.

1175
01:48:17,570 --> 01:48:18,540
That's a key, right?

1176
01:48:18,980 --> 01:48:20,380
I win all chicken.

1177
01:48:22,780 --> 01:48:24,880
I win all chicken.

1178
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:26,380
I did it.

1179
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:34,760
I won so hard, I never even ulted.

1180
01:48:34,860 --> 01:48:36,740
I mean, zero, oh, fuck.

1181
01:48:38,920 --> 01:48:39,880
That's right.

1182
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:42,860
I won the chicken.

1183
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:52,180
See, this is why you can't get to Celestial playing the way I do, because you didn't play the way I do.

1184
01:48:52,420 --> 01:48:53,740
I was actually playing the...

1185
01:48:53,740 --> 01:48:55,020
I kept 16.

1186
01:48:55,760 --> 01:48:57,320
Are you fucking kidding me?

1187
01:48:57,600 --> 01:49:00,600
That was the wildest raccoon game of mine.

1188
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:07,660
That was, I was not even, like, I didn't stand still for one second.

1189
01:49:08,140 --> 01:49:08,980
That's crazy.

1190
01:49:09,300 --> 01:49:11,840
Also, Brandon died 16 times.

1191
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:14,120
This guy was not having a good time.

1192
01:49:17,020 --> 01:49:20,100
I need to check, I need to check what Brandon was doing.

1193
01:49:23,770 --> 01:49:25,910
Bro, I held my ult so good there.

1194
01:49:26,390 --> 01:49:27,170
I deserve more.

1195
01:49:28,530 --> 01:49:29,530
Alright, Brandon.

1196
01:49:30,910 --> 01:49:32,010
Wasn't that low.

1197
01:49:32,130 --> 01:49:33,770
There's not a Celestia player.

1198
01:49:33,910 --> 01:50:01,670
on right now or how bad was it playing like this guy yeah i want to know how bad why did he not just play raccoon or jeff or jeff like why was he so insistent on playing on playing luna no it's because i was the highest ranked player in the lobby yeah no that's not fun Where the fuck is his other support?

1199
01:50:03,370 --> 01:50:04,310
Yeah, no, that's...

1200
01:50:04,310 --> 01:50:06,330
See, this is why I stopped playing Luna, guys.

1201
01:50:06,530 --> 01:50:06,890
This is...

1202
01:50:08,250 --> 01:50:09,650
No, you can...

1203
01:50:09,650 --> 01:50:10,510
Now you know why.

1204
01:50:11,330 --> 01:50:12,130
I don't...

1205
01:50:12,130 --> 01:50:14,090
I don't play Luna anymore.

1206
01:50:14,470 --> 01:50:15,970
Because that could have been me.

1207
01:50:18,550 --> 01:50:20,630
That could have been me right there.

1208
01:50:22,350 --> 01:50:24,550
All I do, I see a Black Panther.

1209
01:50:24,670 --> 01:50:25,710
You know what I saw?

1210
01:50:25,950 --> 01:50:27,430
I fucking climbed the wall.

1211
01:50:27,810 --> 01:50:28,630
Okay, you don't know...

1212
01:50:28,630 --> 01:50:29,750
Okay, here's my perception.

1213
01:50:29,770 --> 01:50:30,790
perspective.

1214
01:50:32,810 --> 01:50:34,690
Okay, that's not very good perspective.

1215
01:50:35,810 --> 01:50:38,750
But this is what happened to me when I got dope.

1216
01:50:39,470 --> 01:50:41,450
Because I was the enemy team's brand.

1217
01:50:41,570 --> 01:50:41,990
Look at that.

1218
01:50:42,130 --> 01:50:45,050
I was like, oh, yeah, let me go to my...

1219
01:50:45,050 --> 01:50:45,690
Oh, there you go.

1220
01:50:45,790 --> 01:50:47,170
This is my pillar now.

1221
01:50:47,590 --> 01:50:48,950
Can't kill me.

1222
01:50:49,170 --> 01:50:50,230
I got a pillar.

1223
01:50:53,350 --> 01:50:55,130
I climb a wall.

1224
01:50:56,210 --> 01:50:57,410
That's all you gotta do.

1225
01:50:59,830 --> 01:51:01,030
Look at that.

1226
01:51:01,850 --> 01:51:02,650
Wall climbed.

1227
01:51:04,910 --> 01:51:06,510
Okay, this is crazy.

1228
01:51:06,910 --> 01:51:07,650
It broke.

1229
01:51:10,350 --> 01:51:12,390
Wall climbed successfully.

1230
01:51:17,090 --> 01:51:18,390
Wait a minute.

1231
01:51:19,970 --> 01:51:20,290
All right.

1232
01:51:20,870 --> 01:51:22,710
I gotta know what does this look like?

1233
01:51:22,930 --> 01:51:23,710
That was sad.

1234
01:51:27,530 --> 01:51:27,830
All right.

1235
01:51:28,090 --> 01:51:29,190
I need to know.

1236
01:51:29,190 --> 01:51:30,830
I think he should stop playing DPS.

1237
01:51:31,330 --> 01:51:33,450
I think it might be too late for him.

1238
01:51:34,470 --> 01:51:35,330
I mean, he got...

1239
01:51:35,330 --> 01:51:36,830
He got the panther.

1240
01:51:37,050 --> 01:51:39,330
Okay, let's do this.

1241
01:51:46,730 --> 01:51:48,150
Bro, stop!

1242
01:51:53,810 --> 01:51:56,730
Wait, I need a rewind.

1243
01:51:57,150 --> 01:51:58,130
That was...

1244
01:51:58,130 --> 01:51:58,530
Wait.

1245
01:51:59,250 --> 01:52:01,030
I need a rewind on that.

1246
01:52:01,390 --> 01:52:02,450
That was pretty good.

1247
01:52:02,850 --> 01:52:04,510
That was pretty good.

1248
01:52:07,550 --> 01:52:08,150
Alright.

1249
01:52:09,970 --> 01:52:10,770

My first...

1253
01:53:50,430 --> 01:53:51,370
My first rookie.

1254
01:53:54,530 --> 01:53:54,830
All right.

1255
01:53:54,950 --> 01:53:55,990
Don't worry, guys.

We're gonna have some clients tonight.

1258
01:54:02,230 --> 01:54:04,170
To be fair, I don't know if 6 a.m.

1259
01:54:04,190 --> 01:54:06,670
strip club might not be, like, the most appealing thing.

1260
01:54:07,470 --> 01:54:08,110
But where is...

1261
01:54:08,110 --> 01:54:08,510
Oh, hey.

1262
01:54:10,690 --> 01:54:12,210

1263
01:54:13,250 --> 01:54:13,690
Where's...

1264
01:54:13,710 --> 01:54:14,610
A mantis.

1265
01:54:15,470 --> 01:54:15,830
Mantis!

1266
01:54:17,750 --> 01:54:18,670
Mantis.

1267
01:54:19,310 --> 01:54:21,950
Do you have dance emu?

1268
01:54:23,510 --> 01:54:25,270
I'm here to recruit.

1269
01:54:26,450 --> 01:54:27,670
I know where she lives.

1270
01:54:32,030 --> 01:54:32,650
Does she?

1271
01:54:35,010 --> 01:54:37,790
Does Pete the cat have it?

1272
01:54:39,410 --> 01:54:40,330

1273
01:54:40,790 --> 01:54:41,490

Oh.

1275
01:54:44,570 --> 01:54:45,490
Oh.

1276
01:54:50,490 --> 01:54:52,510
I can't believe it.

1277
01:54:52,810 --> 01:54:54,250
He doesn't have the money.

1278
01:54:56,370 --> 01:54:58,390
You don't matter to me anymore.

1279
01:55:02,390 --> 01:55:04,370
She doesn't matter to me anymore.

1280
01:55:04,630 --> 01:55:06,870
She's worthless in this business.

1281
01:55:09,410 --> 01:55:09,890
I'm not...

1282
01:55:09,890 --> 01:55:13,310
I can't make her a star if she doesn't have the dance emote, guys.

1283
01:55:17,130 --> 01:55:17,730
That's right.

1284
01:55:18,050 --> 01:55:18,590
That's right.

1285
01:55:18,670 --> 01:55:20,870
I'm telling mom, whoa, whoa, hey, I didn't do anything.

1286
01:55:20,950 --> 01:55:22,350
I'm telling mom what you did.

1287
01:55:22,530 --> 01:55:23,510
That's fucking right.

1288
01:55:25,130 --> 01:55:25,690
Womp, womp.

1289
01:55:27,130 --> 01:55:29,670
Also, like, if you guys watched the sponsor, I didn't realize that.

1290
01:55:29,950 --> 01:55:41,070
But the reason why I was, like, laughing so hard during, you know, the death scene, where, like, like, one of the Nikes died and, like, Bao was like, oh, and then I was just, like, laughing so hard.

1291
01:55:42,170 --> 01:55:44,930
It was because I forgot about that because I couldn't hear it.

1292
01:55:46,130 --> 01:55:48,950
And it's because Snuffy was like, Womp, Womp.

1293
01:55:51,230 --> 01:55:53,090
So obviously I cracked.

1294
01:55:53,730 --> 01:55:54,750
Like, I'm fucking crazy.

1295
01:55:54,890 --> 01:55:56,210
I'm gonna fucking laugh.

1296
01:55:56,710 --> 01:55:58,050
She was like, Womp, Womp.

1297
01:55:58,430 --> 01:55:59,050
And Tepsi.

1298
01:55:59,350 --> 01:56:04,270
But it was like so quiet that it was barely picked up by the camera.

1299
01:56:09,510 --> 01:56:10,490
So I didn't know.

1300
01:56:10,550 --> 01:56:12,190
I forgot about it.

1301
01:56:13,190 --> 01:56:15,990
Bro, that Nikkei sponsorship was like a home video.

1302
01:56:17,490 --> 01:56:18,050
Oh.

1303
01:56:19,950 --> 01:56:33,590
because we're like we're doing like a home video oh yeah that's a thick ass pole though you're right i forgot the swap skins like are you can you survive the cringe

1304
01:56:37,710 --> 01:57:05,870
it's literally like are you strong enough to to watch this no i feel like i feel like you guys are like the parents watching us vtubers who were the kids at like um at like a school play i was like hello it is i don't keep the bird and then you're like the parents of the camcorder and being like there she is that's my daughter that's my bird

1305
01:57:12,530 --> 01:57:29,690
watching the kids do a fortnight dance um in in the christmas play in the Christmas, like, the Bethlehem play, where, like, where, like, he's a three wise man, starts cranking it.

1306
01:57:32,130 --> 01:57:42,350
Have you guys ever seen that, what's it called, Scamilton, where, like, a church did a revised version of Hamilton and made it more Christian?

1307
01:57:43,210 --> 01:57:44,290
That shit is crazy.

1308
01:57:44,950 --> 01:57:47,750
Yeah, it's so fucking funny.

1309
01:57:50,070 --> 01:58:17,670
It's so good i'm trying to remember like parts about it but there was like i think there was one part where obviously you know hamilton cheated on his wife with a prostitute but they they couldn't say that like they're like a christian it's like a christian version of a hamilton um so they couldn't i don't remember what they did but they were like we gotta avoid that we can't talk about

1310
01:58:26,220 --> 01:58:51,760
oh yeah and then he at the end the past year it was like thank you lynn manuel for approving our copy of like our rewrite of hamilton but then you know someone filmed it i think they didn't realize they i don't know if like originally oh yeah originally it wasn't like you know they weren't expecting it to be like uh published online but someone filmed it and then published it and was

1311
01:58:55,520 --> 01:58:58,580
Church did a rewrite of Hamilton.

1312
01:59:01,460 --> 01:59:08,200
And then Lin-Manuel sent like a cease and desist to the church and was like, I did not approve of this.

1313
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:18,860
Because the pastor was like, thank you, Lin-Manuel, for giving us approval on letting us rewrite Hamilton to fit more with God.

1314
01:59:23,820 --> 01:59:27,440
Yeah, and then, you know, they didn't expect themselves to get fact checked.

1315
01:59:27,560 --> 01:59:31,600
So there he was like Please stop I

1316
01:59:41,120 --> 01:59:47,260
don't know He actually got sued But like I thought it was funny That he got a cease and desist

1317
01:59:50,900 --> 02:00:08,880
Whoa Alright ladies Ladies Stop fighting Oh you know what Yes you also have a lord icon Are we serious I do have a lord icon God, I'm Mantis.

1318
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:14,820
Five out of six.

1319
02:00:15,600 --> 02:00:17,940
One guy isn't being a team player.

1320
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:24,840
Look, I don't like that our only DPS is...

1321
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:26,600
Are you actually gonna play Ultron?

1322
02:00:26,780 --> 02:00:27,700
He's gonna play Ultron.

1323
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:28,720
Oh my god.

1324
02:00:29,980 --> 02:00:31,980
I have not seen Ultron in so long.

1325
02:00:32,060 --> 02:00:33,820
Because there's just better triple supports.

1326
02:00:34,140 --> 02:00:34,820
This sucks.

1327
02:00:43,710 --> 02:00:52,750
I don't, I'm not a fan of, um, our widow being the only DPS, but we get, Tego, we get, uh, I don't see Ultron that much, though.

1328
02:00:53,250 --> 02:00:56,710
He's not that, like, because there's better triple support options, you know?

1329
02:00:58,350 --> 02:01:05,570
Like, I just don't, I never, I barely ever see Ultron anymore, just because, like, there's other triple supports that are just 100% better.

1330
02:01:06,050 --> 02:01:07,670
Like, if anything, he should be going at

1331
02:01:11,330 --> 02:01:43,680
triple support and like you should go at them with the mantis so I have like my oh this is bad for him oh this is bad all right this is why this is why I didn't want him didn't want didn't want the widow being our only DPS there What the fuck?

1332
02:01:43,780 --> 02:01:45,380
Why do we lock her in?

1333
02:01:46,840 --> 02:01:48,240
Oh, that's unlucky.

1334
02:01:56,050 --> 02:01:58,550
I feel like us Ultron.

1335
02:01:59,650 --> 02:02:01,750
I feel like Ultron's harder to aim than Adam.

1336
02:02:03,130 --> 02:02:06,790
I am, um, to have like, um, to have like good damage?

1337
02:02:11,730 --> 02:02:17,350
Oh, yeah, no, we should have given Dylan Dubs, like, because he's like an actual Mantis one tray.

1338
02:02:18,810 --> 02:02:21,170
Like, he should- he should have been playing.

1339
02:02:21,710 --> 02:02:22,110
Manzus.

1340
02:02:23,290 --> 02:02:24,110
Can you cue pocket me?

1341
02:02:24,190 --> 02:02:25,450
I'm popping all- Oh.

1342
02:02:27,190 --> 02:02:28,890
I don't think that's what he meant by pocket.

1343
02:02:30,110 --> 02:02:30,750
Hey, guys.

1344
02:02:34,410 --> 02:02:36,530
What the fuck happened to my- Okay.

1345
02:02:41,170 --> 02:02:43,810
Guys, I don't think when he said, can you pocket me?

1346
02:02:43,910 --> 02:02:47,150
I don't think Mantus- It meant, like, Mantus also ulting.

1347
02:02:48,770 --> 02:02:53,590
So we lost two support outs in one go and then I got eaten

1348
02:03:00,870 --> 02:03:05,210
All right, I don't want to waste this but I don't have to

1349
02:03:11,330 --> 02:03:20,850
All right, at least I still have my up haha Yeah, I feel so confident Oh.

1350
02:03:23,170 --> 02:03:26,670
The E-O-M-M-Giveth and the E-O-M-M-T take it.

1351
02:03:26,690 --> 02:03:27,090
Find you guys.

1352
02:03:28,130 --> 02:03:29,790
Oh, let's go.

1353
02:03:31,150 --> 02:03:31,610
Alright.

1354
02:03:32,110 --> 02:03:33,230
Yeah, no, I would have died.

1355
02:03:34,550 --> 02:03:36,170
I would have died if I didn't.

1356
02:03:38,530 --> 02:03:40,090
I do not trust this lobby.

1357
02:03:44,160 --> 02:03:45,120
Okay, thank God.

1358
02:03:47,120 --> 02:03:48,080
Okay, we gotta...

1359
02:03:48,820 --> 02:03:50,420

Nope.

1363
02:04:37,370 --> 02:04:37,670
That's it.

1364
02:04:38,250 --> 02:04:40,230
I'm not enabling this Ultron anymore.

1365
02:04:41,990 --> 02:04:42,850
That's it.

1366
02:04:45,450 --> 02:04:47,470
This Ultron can die for all I care.

1367
02:04:52,530 --> 02:04:56,840
This Ultron his dad he ain't getting my snowflake he doesn't deserve it

1368
02:05:03,410 --> 02:05:25,750
like it's it's a comp issue i mean it's a little bit of like a player issue too but like ultron ultron is actually not it it's time to play all chicken again to be fair i should be playing invas I definitely should have been playing in this.

1369
02:05:25,830 --> 02:05:26,750
I'm ready when you are Angela.

1370
02:05:27,050 --> 02:05:27,490
Ready when you are

1371
02:05:30,830 --> 02:05:33,430

02:06:01,700 --> 02:06:01,700
Go!

1376
02:06:02,560 --> 02:06:02,560
Go!

1377
02:06:03,280 --> 02:06:03,960
Fight this!

1378
02:06:06,160 --> 02:06:07,260
Okay, never mind.

1379
02:06:07,500 --> 02:06:08,120
That was a battle.

1380
02:06:08,260 --> 02:06:10,280
I will admit that was a battle for me.

1381
02:06:10,780 --> 02:06:12,020
I will admit that.

1382
02:06:13,160 --> 02:06:14,700
I will take flame.

1383
02:06:15,700 --> 02:06:18,100
I thought they were... I thought they'd be closer.

1384
02:06:19,080 --> 02:06:20,100
I legitimately thought...

1385
02:06:21,800 --> 02:06:24,720
That was my bad for thinking they'd be closer.

1386
02:06:26,780 --> 02:06:28,740
I didn't realize they would do the...

1387
02:06:29,320 --> 02:06:30,520
You know what I didn't realize?

1388
02:06:31,020 --> 02:06:32,540
I didn't realize they could kite it.

1389
02:06:33,080 --> 02:06:34,540
They could just walk backwards.

1390
02:06:34,720 --> 02:06:35,320
Isn't that crazy?

1391
02:06:35,880 --> 02:06:37,560
What a crazy concept.

1392
02:06:38,440 --> 02:06:40,000
I was just like, holy shit, you can do that.

1393
02:06:40,140 --> 02:06:43,040
You can just walk backwards and kite my ult.

1394
02:06:43,820 --> 02:06:45,080
Angela, when you farm all, I got you.

1395
02:06:46,860 --> 02:06:48,640
Oh no, I know how to do the wall attack.

1396
02:06:49,480 --> 02:06:52,880
By the way, you guys didn't see it, but some guy, he wrote raccoon.

1397
02:06:53,320 --> 02:06:55,640
But I know how to do the wall attack.

1398
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:57,520
I just never had the moment to...

1399
02:06:59,160 --> 02:06:59,800
to do it yet.

1400
02:07:00,180 --> 02:07:01,260
You haven't cheered.

1401
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,180
Well, apparently not.

1402
02:07:07,700 --> 02:07:08,500
Oh, shit.

1403
02:07:10,020 --> 02:07:10,540
Broody tooth.

1404
02:07:10,820 --> 02:07:11,380
It's behind.

1405
02:07:14,080 --> 02:07:14,140
Oh.

1406
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:15,400
Goodbye.

1407
02:07:21,780 --> 02:07:21,920
Alright.

1408
02:07:24,240 --> 02:07:25,320
I'm healing.

1409
02:07:27,780 --> 02:07:28,460
Okay.

1410
02:07:29,160 --> 02:07:29,700
Are we going?

1411
02:07:30,160 --> 02:07:32,060
We should go with the mantis up.

1412
02:07:32,320 --> 02:07:32,560
Yep.

1413
02:07:32,740 --> 02:07:35,020
I was gonna say it.

1414
02:07:35,020 --> 02:07:35,480
Yeah, yeah.

1415
02:07:36,140 --> 02:07:39,600
About that, everyone about that, everyone about that way of time.

1416
02:07:40,300 --> 02:07:41,320
There you go.

1417
02:07:41,940 --> 02:07:43,000
Kill Guru again, kill Guru.

1418
02:07:43,140 --> 02:07:43,260
Kill Guru.

1419
02:07:43,260 --> 02:07:46,700
Oh, yo.

1420
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:51,000
We also kill, I don't know, this guy.

1421
02:07:54,480 --> 02:07:55,340
On me, on me.

1422
02:07:56,500 --> 02:07:57,640
Yeah, there is it.

1423
02:07:58,840 --> 02:07:59,840
There is it.

1424
02:08:00,320 --> 02:08:01,740
Okay, we're not, we're gonna ignore him.

1425
02:08:01,880 --> 02:08:02,300
That's cool.

1426
02:08:02,420 --> 02:08:03,500
The Phoenix on the left.

1427
02:08:06,140 --> 02:08:08,020
Wait, where did the Phoenix go?

1428
02:08:12,640 --> 02:08:16,000
No, our Ultron is a Mantis player.

1429
02:08:17,180 --> 02:08:17,500
Oh, fuck.

1430
02:08:17,640 --> 02:08:18,560
I wasn't supposed to do that.

1431
02:08:20,500 --> 02:08:21,820
Sometimes I accidentally used my jump pack.

1432
02:08:22,080 --> 02:08:22,840
That ain't good.

1433
02:08:23,660 --> 02:08:25,760
The thing is, it's time to play up chicken again.

1434
02:08:28,320 --> 02:08:29,820
Oh, you kidding me?

1435
02:08:32,220 --> 02:08:33,000
Yo, buddy, yo.

1436
02:08:34,400 --> 02:08:35,760
I'm literally eating.

1437
02:08:38,520 --> 02:08:38,940
Rock it all.

1438
02:08:39,040 --> 02:08:39,900
Leave rock it all.

1439
02:08:40,360 --> 02:08:41,400
Oh my god.

1440
02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:43,880
Oh my god.

1441
02:08:45,040 --> 02:08:47,100
I couldn't do anything about it.

1442
02:08:50,280 --> 02:08:51,540
See, it was all chicken.

1443
02:08:52,220 --> 02:08:52,400
See it was all chicken.

1444
02:08:52,400 --> 02:08:53,580
I had to all chicken it.

1445
02:08:53,680 --> 02:09:02,120
I told you, it's literally all chicken.

1446
02:09:04,100 --> 02:09:05,060
He won.

1447
02:09:05,380 --> 02:09:07,120
He won all chicken.

1448
02:09:10,260 --> 02:09:11,860
He fucking won all chicken.

1449
02:09:14,120 --> 02:09:17,820
Don't you hate it when they win all chicken?

1450
02:09:24,070 --> 02:09:26,110
They actually won all chicken.

1451
02:09:27,010 --> 02:09:31,010
The current score is 0, 2, 3.

1452
02:09:32,230 --> 02:09:35,710
Time to switch things up, including which side you're on.

1453
02:09:37,330 --> 02:10:07,670
I will say we did hold better when I was on Rack I think I'll just have to play in this I don't want to play Luna what is all chicken all chicken is basically um the Phoenix and I have to the thing is as Luna I'll just get targeted by Jeff so it's like because my mag doesn't save his ult to save me so I just get eaten so as Raccoon I can fucking run away easier That's why I still have to Raccoon,

1454
02:10:08,450 --> 02:10:12,090
because, uh, as Invis, at least I can go Invisible.

1455
02:10:13,310 --> 02:10:23,550
But Alt-Chicken is basically the, the Phoenix holds her alt for, against my alt, because her alt instantly destroys Rocket Alt, and also does damage.

1456
02:10:23,770 --> 02:10:27,350
So, like, but if I never alt, she never alts.

1457
02:10:28,110 --> 02:10:29,110
And, like, she knows that.

1458
02:10:29,170 --> 02:10:32,790
So she never alts, because she has, she's waiting for me to go alt.

1459
02:10:33,110 --> 02:10:34,930
So it's, it's, it's Alt-Chicken.

1460
02:10:38,190 --> 02:10:53,670
It's like whoever breaks first fucks their team and then I broke because I was getting fucking like because I was getting chased and then like the guy was like you should all you should all and I was like all right it's your fault.

1461
02:10:55,630 --> 02:11:04,910
Yeah it's waiting for whoever I the thing is Dylan is a fucking Mantis one trick too which is very annoying because we have two Mantis one tricks

1462
02:11:08,170 --> 02:11:10,010
That's why it's like super annoying.

1463
02:11:12,430 --> 02:11:14,810
Like, I have to avoid one of the Mantis.

1464
02:11:14,990 --> 02:11:18,290
The thing is, I don't know who this other person is, the Chimkin.

1465
02:11:18,830 --> 02:11:20,490
But, like, Dylan doesn't swap.

1466
02:11:25,330 --> 02:11:27,870
From every time I've, like, had him.

1467
02:11:28,350 --> 02:11:31,810
I would sometimes avoid him just because, like, it does.

1468
02:11:32,190 --> 02:11:35,670
Because the only way to make this work is if I have another triple support.

1469
02:11:39,990 --> 02:11:48,890
Also, the only reason why I don't want to go Luna for him is because this Jeff See?

1470
02:11:51,130 --> 02:11:51,670
That's why.

1471
02:11:52,250 --> 02:11:53,410
Because he would just solo me.

1472
02:11:54,430 --> 02:11:55,330
So it's just not worth it.

1473
02:11:55,950 --> 02:11:55,950
Really?

1474
02:11:57,050 --> 02:11:58,910
Okay, I think I know who to avoid.

1475
02:12:00,030 --> 02:12:01,630
Actually, now I know who to avoid.

1476
02:12:05,650 --> 02:12:06,890
No, okay, no.

1477
02:12:06,970 --> 02:12:11,890
This is Worse, I'd rather have an Ultron than what I just saw.

1478
02:12:14,290 --> 02:12:15,570
I really...

1479
02:12:15,570 --> 02:12:17,410
Yeah, no, I would...

1480
02:12:17,410 --> 02:12:18,570
Yeah, I'd rather have...

1481
02:12:18,570 --> 02:12:20,530
I'd rather have an Ultron.

1482
02:12:21,650 --> 02:12:24,310
I'd rather have Dylan on Mantis than this.

1483
02:12:24,390 --> 02:12:26,110
Everyone target...

1484
02:12:26,110 --> 02:12:27,030
Disappear!

1485
02:12:27,630 --> 02:12:28,230
Disappear!

1486
02:12:28,530 --> 02:12:28,890
Okay.

1487
02:12:34,610 --> 02:12:35,710
That's bad.

1488
02:12:37,470 --> 02:12:38,670
Oh, goodbye.

1489
02:12:44,420 --> 02:12:46,100
All right

1490
02:12:50,200 --> 02:13:01,800
We're not winning this I I have no confident in my team Oh He like was at the weirdest position for that

1491
02:13:06,430 --> 02:13:15,230
Nice Jesus Christ chill Holy shit

1492
02:13:18,350 --> 02:13:19,750
Yeah, it's a GG.

1493
02:13:20,870 --> 02:13:23,310
It is 100% GG.

1494
02:13:27,390 --> 02:13:29,610
At least I know it's not me, you know?

1495
02:13:32,430 --> 02:13:33,490
At least I know.

1496
02:13:36,790 --> 02:13:39,850
I'm at Celestia tier right now, but I haven't played a lot this season.

1497
02:13:40,510 --> 02:13:44,850
I think if I played more, maybe I could, like, get to watch.

1498
02:13:44,910 --> 02:13:46,050
See, I could just do this.

1499
02:13:50,570 --> 02:14:09,150
Okay, at least it's like Oh I mean, I faded They're all out And now I have to leave Wait, what?

1500
02:14:09,630 --> 02:14:10,550
What is he doing here?

1501
02:14:10,690 --> 02:14:21,420
Wait, he was behind us I will say I will say I have the least amount of deaths.

1502
02:14:22,240 --> 02:14:23,960
Oh, yeah, we have not killed the Phoenix at all.

1503
02:14:24,080 --> 02:14:28,520
No, okay, no, this is our entire team problem.

1504
02:14:31,160 --> 02:14:32,460
No, never mind.

1505
02:14:32,660 --> 02:14:33,500
This is a team issue.

1506
02:14:33,960 --> 02:14:35,940
We've not killed the Phoenix one time.

1507
02:14:36,440 --> 02:14:38,180
This is a team issue at that point.

1508
02:14:40,900 --> 02:14:42,800
I didn't even notice the Phoenix.

1509
02:14:44,340 --> 02:14:45,800
Alright, I gotta...

1510
02:14:47,160 --> 02:14:47,960
Bro, I...

1511
02:14:47,960 --> 02:14:48,740
Guys, I don't...

1512
02:14:48,800 --> 02:14:51,220
Guys, I don't know yet.

1513
02:14:52,940 --> 02:14:55,680
You know, it's a win if we kill the Phoenix.

1514
02:15:00,560 --> 02:15:02,540
He was against the podium.

1515
02:15:02,960 --> 02:15:04,460
He was so lucky.

1516
02:15:04,700 --> 02:15:05,900
Oh my god.

1517
02:15:10,030 --> 02:15:11,190
That was so lucky.

1518
02:15:11,450 --> 02:15:12,830
He was actually so lucky.

1519
02:15:16,310 --> 02:15:17,410
I'm so sad.

1520
02:15:18,310 --> 02:15:20,530
He literally lived because he was against the podium.

1521
02:15:20,550 --> 02:15:20,950
him.

1522
02:15:33,240 --> 02:15:38,340
Oh my god, I'm trying to... Oh wait, what the fuck?

1523
02:15:42,430 --> 02:15:44,730
There we go.

1524
02:15:50,170 --> 02:15:51,530
See, look at that, I'm invisible.

1525
02:15:52,490 --> 02:15:56,650
Look at that, with the power of... Why can't my... You know what?

1526
02:15:56,790 --> 02:15:59,350
No, I have to say, Why can't my mag do that?

1527
02:16:01,390 --> 02:16:02,090
He doesn't know.

1528
02:16:02,470 --> 02:16:03,050
Oh, he did.

1529
02:16:04,350 --> 02:16:05,610
Oh, my God, he did.

1530
02:16:06,290 --> 02:16:07,190
Oh, we killed him twice.

1531
02:16:07,370 --> 02:16:07,870
We did it.

1532
02:16:08,370 --> 02:16:09,730
I don't care if we lose.

1533
02:16:10,050 --> 02:16:11,110
We killed him twice.

1534
02:16:16,870 --> 02:16:17,810
It's okay.

1535
02:16:18,690 --> 02:16:20,010
We got him.

1536
02:16:20,530 --> 02:16:21,790
We did it, boys.

1537
02:16:22,410 --> 02:16:23,710
We killed him twice.

1538
02:16:32,020 --> 02:16:33,180
Oh, yeah.

1539
02:16:33,200 --> 02:16:33,960
Yeah, no, we're dead.

1540
02:16:39,780 --> 02:16:41,560
Zero, two, three.

1541
02:16:41,720 --> 02:16:42,920
Yeah, imagine if that...

1542
02:16:42,920 --> 02:16:43,260
You know what?

1543
02:16:43,260 --> 02:16:45,360
No, I'm going to avoid both the supports, actually.

1544
02:16:45,720 --> 02:16:48,280
So I don't have to have two Mantis one tricks.

1545
02:16:48,880 --> 02:16:54,400
I'm pretty sure the other Mantis will avoid the other Mantis, but then now I know, like, both of them won't be on my team.

1546
02:16:57,800 --> 02:16:59,440
I was out here struggling.

1547
02:17:01,260 --> 02:17:01,660
13k?

1548
02:17:02,080 --> 02:17:02,400
Really?

1549
02:17:02,700 --> 02:17:08,300
I mean, did he get 22k damage, still but still like

1550
02:17:12,180 --> 02:17:35,300
all right we can't be having two mantis one tricks together no they'll most likely avoid each other i don't think i was the problem in that entire fight all right how close am i okay thank god i'm not that close God.

1551
02:17:36,540 --> 02:17:39,140
As long as I'm not close to Lord,

1552
02:17:46,160 --> 02:17:48,900
that's fine.

1553
02:17:50,840 --> 02:17:59,020
I think the most thing I'm just concerned about was the fact that either of them did not swap.

1554
02:18:01,260 --> 02:18:03,980
But at that point, it wasn't just a support line up.

1555
02:18:04,320 --> 02:18:05,820
We were, I don't know.

1556
02:18:05,940 --> 02:18:08,040
I mean, I didn't know if our DPS was doing good.

1557
02:18:08,400 --> 02:18:09,080
I couldn't tell.

1558
02:18:14,930 --> 02:18:16,010
I couldn't tell.

1559
02:18:16,230 --> 02:18:16,670
Oops, sorry.

1560
02:18:18,430 --> 02:18:18,990
Hello, everyone.

1561
02:18:21,170 --> 02:18:23,110
Club Jokeybird is open for business.

1562
02:18:23,550 --> 02:18:24,170
That's right.

1563
02:18:24,850 --> 02:18:25,330
Come on.

1564
02:18:25,730 --> 02:18:26,650
Come on.

1565
02:18:26,730 --> 02:18:28,750
Don't you want to work that pull?

1566
02:18:29,310 --> 02:18:31,810
You got to pay for college, don't you?

1567
02:18:35,650 --> 02:18:38,590
I'm offering a good cut.

1568
02:18:39,870 --> 02:18:41,290
Oh, come on, guys.

1569
02:18:41,670 --> 02:18:43,230
Pulls are hard to come by.

1570
02:18:46,250 --> 02:18:47,170
Oh, that's true.

1571
02:18:47,270 --> 02:18:47,970
He did go Widow.

1572
02:18:48,050 --> 02:18:49,090
Oh, I should have avoided the Widow.

1573
02:18:49,470 --> 02:18:49,470
Whatever.

1574
02:18:50,310 --> 02:18:50,970
It's fine.

1575
02:18:53,650 --> 02:18:55,550
Wait, why are these people fighting?

1576
02:18:56,090 --> 02:18:56,570
Stop.

1577
02:18:57,790 --> 02:18:59,010
Stop, everyone.

1578
02:18:59,190 --> 02:19:00,230
We were so peaceful.

1579
02:19:00,750 --> 02:19:03,670
Ever since I opened Club Dokey Bird.

1580
02:19:04,410 --> 02:19:05,870
Things were so rough.

1581
02:19:07,750 --> 02:19:08,830
Oh, I don't even remember.

1582
02:19:09,270 --> 02:19:11,410
Someone on our team was on Widow.

1583
02:19:16,350 --> 02:19:49,150
even remember when that happened yeah i'm i'm so um generous i'll give you a 10 cut if you work for club dokey babe that's why you should dance next to our queen come on just do you know you want to come on just here i'll demonstrate that that whoa yeah yeah just whoa everyone's a fucking critic I'm like her pet.

1584
02:19:54,740 --> 02:19:56,800
I can't believe it.

1585
02:19:57,120 --> 02:19:58,700
Everyone's so violent.

1586
02:20:02,560 --> 02:20:03,980
I don't understand.

1587
02:20:04,640 --> 02:20:06,000
What happened, everyone?

1588
02:20:06,320 --> 02:20:08,840
What happened to my RIP servers?

1589
02:20:09,640 --> 02:20:11,900
Where's the peace of love?

1590
02:20:12,260 --> 02:20:13,520
Peace of love.

1591
02:20:16,300 --> 02:20:19,140
I missed my roleplay servers.

1592
02:20:19,660 --> 02:20:21,760
Nobody wants the roleplay.

1593
02:20:21,780 --> 02:20:22,480
anymore.

1594
02:20:24,220 --> 02:20:24,460
Come on.

1595
02:20:24,780 --> 02:20:25,840
Any RPAs?

1596
02:20:26,760 --> 02:20:27,660
Hey, Rixie.

1597
02:20:29,020 --> 02:20:32,160
Trying to open a club, but everyone's so violent.

1598
02:20:33,540 --> 02:20:35,940
It's a tough time for a small business owner.

1599
02:20:36,480 --> 02:20:39,360
Remember to support your local business owners, guys.

1600
02:20:41,020 --> 02:20:43,800
It's so hard to start a business.

1601
02:20:46,780 --> 02:20:47,520
Alright, guys.

1602
02:20:47,760 --> 02:20:48,220
Come on.

1603
02:20:48,700 --> 02:20:49,720
Here's the Paula.

1604
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:50,620
Alright, don't worry.

1605
02:20:50,780 --> 02:20:51,760
I'll give you a step one.

1606
02:20:51,780 --> 02:20:53,540
You stand on the pull.

1607
02:20:53,860 --> 02:20:57,220
Who is he?

1608
02:20:57,920 --> 02:20:58,640
Who is he?

1609
02:20:59,300 --> 02:21:00,000
That's it.

1610
02:21:01,040 --> 02:21:02,000
I'm mad now.

1611
02:21:02,500 --> 02:21:02,940
That's it.

1612
02:21:03,340 --> 02:21:03,700
Give me a sec.

1613
02:21:03,820 --> 02:21:05,020
I gotta remember how to...

1614
02:21:05,020 --> 02:21:07,200
How to unalive in this game.

1615
02:21:07,360 --> 02:21:07,780
I...

1616
02:21:15,510 --> 02:21:17,450
I got you sick-eyed.

1617
02:21:17,930 --> 02:21:20,150
I got you sick-eyed too.

1618
02:21:20,370 --> 02:21:22,010
To a different world.

1619
02:21:22,310 --> 02:21:23,250
Right after.

1620
02:21:27,950 --> 02:21:30,890
I took the wrong way

1621
02:21:34,230 --> 02:21:43,890

1626
02:23:27,300 --> 02:23:28,260
He's meta.

1627
02:23:29,300 --> 02:23:33,320
Like, why the fuck did he ban Rocket?

1628
02:23:33,860 --> 02:23:35,180
He's actually a good...

1629
02:23:35,700 --> 02:23:35,980
Why?

1630
02:23:38,080 --> 02:23:39,660
Wait, did I ban him?

1631
02:23:40,660 --> 02:23:41,260
Bro, I left.

1632
02:23:42,620 --> 02:23:43,220
Oh, wait, I banned...

1633
02:23:46,660 --> 02:23:48,080
I went to see...

1634
02:23:48,080 --> 02:23:49,320
I can't even realize...

1635
02:23:50,480 --> 02:23:51,320
I didn't even...

1636
02:23:51,320 --> 02:23:52,580
Why the fuck is that happening?

1637
02:23:52,840 --> 02:23:54,620
Why the fuck is no one...

1638
02:23:55,180 --> 02:23:56,720
Did no one outbanned me?

1639
02:23:59,960 --> 02:24:00,520
I...

1640
02:24:00,520 --> 02:24:02,320
Fast and peace sabotage.

1641
02:24:02,900 --> 02:24:05,360
Bro, why did no one outbanned me?

1642
02:24:05,840 --> 02:24:06,760
What happened?

1643
02:24:06,860 --> 02:24:07,560
Did I win the...

1644
02:24:07,560 --> 02:24:08,700
Did I win the gacha?

1645
02:24:09,320 --> 02:24:11,240
Was it 25%?

1646
02:24:13,500 --> 02:24:14,280
What is...

1647
02:24:14,280 --> 02:24:16,340
Bro, I was feeding my dog!

1648
02:24:19,240 --> 02:24:22,160
Oh, I was the only one that banned...

1649
02:24:22,160 --> 02:24:23,420
Okay, they can't blame me.

1650
02:24:23,780 --> 02:24:24,900
I was...

1651
02:24:25,180 --> 02:24:27,020
I'd just be like, I fucked up.

1652
02:24:27,600 --> 02:24:30,940
I will admit that I've fucked up.

1653
02:24:34,850 --> 02:24:36,090
That's crazy.

1654
02:24:36,690 --> 02:24:38,110
I won the bad.

1655
02:24:40,270 --> 02:24:42,530
Bro, they're running Mantis Jeb.

1656
02:24:42,730 --> 02:24:43,310
We should...

1657
02:24:43,310 --> 02:24:43,910
Alright, it's fine.

1658
02:24:45,830 --> 02:24:47,090
I wish I was Rocket.

1659
02:24:52,480 --> 02:24:54,400
I can't believe it.

1660
02:24:54,460 --> 02:24:56,360
Nobody stopped me.

1661
02:24:58,360 --> 02:25:27,140
nobody's fucking stopped me they cannot blame me no one stopped me there okay they're fucking loud they're trying to because i was gonna say there's no way that our mag lives this jesus now we're not winning this unless we like swap up our comp but i don't know if that's

1662
02:25:33,520 --> 02:25:34,980
How should I push it up with it?

1663
02:25:36,920 --> 02:25:38,140
Oh, I got scared.

1664
02:25:39,640 --> 02:25:41,140
At least my team lives.

1665
02:25:43,060 --> 02:25:45,380
No, I should do the Scythe and push up with that.

1666
02:25:46,180 --> 02:25:47,500
But I, like, reactionary.

1667
02:25:47,620 --> 02:25:49,260
I did a reactionary for that.

1668
02:25:52,720 --> 02:25:52,980
Oh.

1669
02:25:57,700 --> 02:25:58,140
Goodbye.

1670
02:25:59,040 --> 02:25:59,720
Oh, shit.

1671
02:25:59,940 --> 02:26:00,340
Nice.

1672
02:26:01,240 --> 02:26:01,560
Okay.

1673
02:26:06,460 --> 02:26:08,280
I was like, wait, did his...

1674
02:26:09,060 --> 02:26:11,120
I was like, what the fuck happened?

1675
02:26:14,260 --> 02:26:17,140
I was like, did they like... Oh my god, oops.

1676
02:26:23,200 --> 02:26:23,700
Wee!

1677
02:26:23,940 --> 02:26:29,020
Yeah, we might need more help.

1678
02:26:30,420 --> 02:26:34,920
Like, there's no way that their comp should be winning against our comp.

1679
02:26:35,480 --> 02:26:40,280
Because, like, they should not have enough heals, but they're just winning the brawl faster than...

1680
02:26:41,940 --> 02:26:43,280
Then we can heal it.

1681
02:26:47,880 --> 02:26:48,700
Oh my god.

1682
02:26:49,600 --> 02:26:51,100
Are you serious?

1683
02:26:51,980 --> 02:26:53,960
I have to use this.

1684
02:26:56,380 --> 02:26:57,300
It's fine.

1685
02:26:57,640 --> 02:27:00,320
As long as we stay in our little cubby hole, right?

1686
02:27:01,940 --> 02:27:03,920
The thing is, he might ult now.

1687
02:27:04,860 --> 02:27:07,300
Because I don't really have anything for it.

1688
02:27:10,300 --> 02:27:30,680
Oh my god I have to be so aware This is why I hate This is why I miss playing raccoons I have to be so fucking aware About everything I'm gonna try and let our I want to let our Luna heal But like

1689
02:27:34,210 --> 02:27:43,470
Jesus Christ I can't They're so okay Okay Are we just getting blocked?

1690
02:27:44,490 --> 02:27:48,910
No, the Iron Fist is, like, not doing so well.

1691
02:27:57,400 --> 02:27:57,880
Yeah, there's no.

1692
02:27:58,000 --> 02:27:59,540
No, our Iron Fist is not doing anything.

1693
02:28:03,520 --> 02:28:09,180
We should, theoretically, like, like, theoretically, we should win this just because...

1694
02:28:09,180 --> 02:28:12,420
Actually, no, we shouldn't because we have a 9% that does jack shit.

1695
02:28:15,380 --> 02:28:16,300
Yes, you're...

1696
02:28:16,320 --> 02:28:17,600
makes you you're missing out.

1697
02:28:18,220 --> 02:28:19,560
Iron Fist and Wolverine?

1698
02:28:20,180 --> 02:28:21,180
You're missing out, bro.

1699
02:28:21,500 --> 02:28:24,580
Losing to a Mantis Jeff Heel cop.

1700
02:28:27,600 --> 02:28:29,840
Well, that could be you right now.

1701
02:28:31,380 --> 02:28:32,900
That could be us.

1702
02:28:32,960 --> 02:28:37,640
I'm not the type who fades quietly into the background.

1703
02:28:38,620 --> 02:28:41,080
I could technically play Jeff, but I don't know how to play Jeff.

1704
02:28:41,300 --> 02:28:41,620
You know what?

1705
02:28:41,860 --> 02:28:43,540
Today's the day I learned.

1706
02:28:47,680 --> 02:29:06,680
is it winnable we'll find out we'll find out it's time to learn maybe i'm a natural you don't know that i could be a natural jeff player all my hours of jeff was literally last season

1707
02:29:09,920 --> 02:29:16,900
he is meta i just the way i play it might not be meta Oh my god, I'm eating candy!

1708
02:29:17,980 --> 02:29:18,060
Oh.

1709
02:29:19,220 --> 02:29:22,140
Me being on Jeff does not make the reason why he died.

1710
02:29:23,860 --> 02:29:25,420
It's not the reason why we died.

1711
02:29:30,480 --> 02:29:30,740
Okay.

1712
02:29:31,900 --> 02:29:32,040
Um.

1713
02:29:33,840 --> 02:29:37,120
It's, I will say, it's not my fault.

1714
02:29:37,520 --> 02:29:39,000
I died here.

1715
02:29:39,640 --> 02:29:40,560
Me on Jeff is...

1716
02:29:40,560 --> 02:29:42,080
Oh, I have Halloween music.

1717
02:29:42,980 --> 02:29:43,800
That's cool.

1718
02:29:44,160 --> 02:29:45,040
That's cute.

1719
02:29:45,700 --> 02:29:46,940
All right, now we leave.

1720
02:29:49,180 --> 02:29:52,640
Oh my god, my reload has Halloween music too.

1721
02:29:53,480 --> 02:29:54,500
That's so cute.

1722
02:29:59,070 --> 02:30:00,830
That's cute, I like that.

1723
02:30:01,910 --> 02:30:03,030
Alright, here we go.

1724
02:30:06,550 --> 02:30:07,470
I have ult.

1725
02:30:07,550 --> 02:30:10,030
I don't know how to use it, but I have ult.

1726
02:30:12,290 --> 02:30:15,450
This is my biggest weakness as Jeff.

1727
02:30:15,970 --> 02:30:17,650
I literally don't know how to use my ult.

1728
02:30:19,090 --> 02:30:20,730
Oh, I can use it to eat him.

1729
02:30:25,130 --> 02:30:25,570
There we go.

1730
02:30:29,070 --> 02:30:29,510
Never mind.

1731
02:30:33,070 --> 02:30:34,430
I got him, though.

1732
02:30:34,750 --> 02:30:35,470
I got him.

1733
02:30:36,550 --> 02:30:37,190
Alright, guys.

1734
02:30:37,410 --> 02:30:39,350
I have a feeling Jeff was not it.

1735
02:30:39,590 --> 02:30:40,450
Back to meta.

1736
02:30:41,330 --> 02:30:41,970
I got what?

1737
02:30:42,070 --> 02:30:43,070
Look, I had my one.

1738
02:30:43,890 --> 02:30:44,750
I had my eat.

1739
02:30:45,610 --> 02:30:47,430
But how come there, Jeff, can do that?

1740
02:30:48,990 --> 02:30:50,370
I don't understand.

1741
02:30:52,550 --> 02:30:54,950
How could they chip do all of that?

1742
02:31:01,160 --> 02:31:02,080
All right.

1743
02:31:06,550 --> 02:31:06,850
Oh, yeah.

1744
02:31:07,810 --> 02:31:08,250
It's okay.

1745
02:31:09,210 --> 02:31:10,750
Everything will be fine.

1746
02:31:11,550 --> 02:31:13,310
It won't be fine, but, like, it's okay.

1747
02:31:15,270 --> 02:31:16,650
I can cope.

1748
02:31:18,510 --> 02:31:18,790
All right.

1749
02:31:23,620 --> 02:31:25,120
It's all about coping.

1750
02:31:25,300 --> 02:31:26,840
We didn't have a single kill, but that's...

1751
02:31:26,860 --> 02:31:38,960
okay it's not because of a oh oh he's gonna be like legendary yeah this guy's been saving leg I think he's just like doing a challenge I swear

1752
02:31:42,780 --> 02:31:52,080
what oh my god he timed it perfectly oh my god he actually oh he timed it perfectly.

1753
02:31:53,220 --> 02:31:54,300
That's so unfair.

1754
02:31:55,200 --> 02:31:57,620
I fucking heartbeat it.

1755
02:32:01,180 --> 02:32:02,560
That's so unfair.

1756
02:32:03,960 --> 02:32:05,320
I should put it closer to me.

1757
02:32:06,300 --> 02:32:09,260
I didn't think that Mag was, like, zoned in on me.

1758
02:32:10,660 --> 02:32:11,140
Yeah.

1759
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:20,060
I thought, because, like, I was, to be fair, it was four of us clumped together, and then I thought the Mag was, like, not looking at me.

1760
02:32:20,340 --> 02:32:21,880
So I was like, I can get away with this.

1761
02:32:23,700 --> 02:32:25,100
I could get away with it.

1762
02:32:25,960 --> 02:32:26,540
That'll be fine.

1763
02:32:26,920 --> 02:32:28,840
Oh no, that team was very special.

1764
02:32:31,540 --> 02:32:33,640
Yo, my bad team.

1765
02:32:35,800 --> 02:32:37,480
What the fuck?

1766
02:32:38,580 --> 02:32:41,160
Can't Duke a Duke a Duke a Duke.

1767
02:32:42,220 --> 02:32:43,520
Yo, my bad.

1768
02:32:44,640 --> 02:32:47,220
Yeah, he's just like, oh, I'm sorry, bro.

1769
02:32:47,860 --> 02:32:49,160
I'm gonna use the bathroom real quick.

1770
02:32:50,740 --> 02:32:53,280
My bad team is playing like ass.

1771
02:32:53,700 --> 02:32:54,700
At least he apologized.

1772
02:32:54,900 --> 02:32:57,860
Don't worry, I'll give you a show and a dinner.

1773
02:32:58,400 --> 02:32:58,820
I'll be back.

1774
02:34:00,790 --> 02:34:01,250
I'm back.

1775
02:34:01,730 --> 02:34:02,210
It's time.

1776
02:34:06,550 --> 02:34:08,690
What the fuck is Gail still doing today?

1777
02:34:10,190 --> 02:34:12,650
Whoa, yeah, the full frontal and everything?

1778
02:34:13,150 --> 02:34:13,590
You know what?

1779
02:34:13,730 --> 02:34:16,490
I'm gonna make someone's birthday today.

1780
02:34:18,390 --> 02:34:22,170
First time catching the stream and it's Venom twerking.

1781
02:34:23,610 --> 02:34:27,450
Happy birthday to you.

1782
02:34:29,430 --> 02:34:33,450

Alright.

1932
02:43:57,710 --> 02:43:58,750
They might destroy it.

1933
02:43:58,870 --> 02:43:59,770
No, they're too stupid.

1934
02:44:00,450 --> 02:44:00,570

02:44:01,530 --> 02:44:02,370
They don't know.

1937
02:44:03,490 --> 02:44:04,970
The water conceals me.

1938
02:44:05,590 --> 02:44:07,050
I'm a water panda now.

1939
02:44:08,690 --> 02:44:09,050

I have to reload, but I'm doing my best.

1945
02:44:27,290 --> 02:44:29,190
Okay, they don't know that I have a res beacon here.

1946
02:44:29,530 --> 02:44:29,910

02:44:40,950 --> 02:44:42,270
No, he was 99.

1954
02:44:45,710 --> 02:44:46,950
That's so unlucky.

1955
02:44:48,190 --> 02:44:49,110
He was 99.

1956
02:44:50,170 --> 02:44:50,570
99.

1957
02:44:51,310 --> 02:44:53,330
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1958
02:44:53,610 --> 02:44:55,490
Why are you still looking at me?

1959
02:44:55,810 --> 02:44:55,970
Wait.

1960
02:44:57,890 --> 02:44:58,190
That's okay.

1961
02:44:58,470 --> 02:44:58,750
That's okay.

1962
02:44:58,750 --> 02:44:59,770
He's not looking at me.

1963
02:45:00,190 --> 02:45:00,610
It's okay.

1964
02:45:03,330 --> 02:45:04,130
It's okay.

1965
02:45:04,530 --> 02:45:06,090
I'm right below him.

1966
02:45:11,810 --> 02:45:14,650
He's the easiest game of my life.

1967
02:45:14,810 --> 02:45:15,930
He's the easiest game.

1968
02:45:17,530 --> 02:45:19,030
Time to switch things up.

1969
02:45:19,190 --> 02:45:20,890
I'm hitting him like he's like.

1970
02:45:22,050 --> 02:45:23,030
He'll never know.

1971
02:45:23,330 --> 02:45:25,050
Like how he's like, I don't know where she is.

1972
02:45:25,130 --> 02:45:25,770
I'll just stop.

1973
02:45:26,050 --> 02:45:28,310
You'll need a top-notch team to win this one.

1974
02:45:28,990 --> 02:45:31,790
Don't let Doki get away with this.

1975
02:45:35,670 --> 02:45:37,790
I told you, yeah, no object permanence.

1976
02:45:37,910 --> 02:45:38,750
He doesn't see me.

1977
02:45:38,790 --> 02:45:41,270
He's like, where were these healers coming from?

1978
02:45:41,390 --> 02:45:43,090
Not my problem, I guess.

1979
02:45:47,100 --> 02:45:50,960
The crazy part was that guy was fucking chasing me for so long, too.

1980
02:45:51,540 --> 02:45:55,700
And the moment I went right below him, he was just like, fuck that shit.

1981
02:45:56,140 --> 02:45:57,100
That's too much work.

1982
02:45:58,160 --> 02:46:00,700
My neck can't go down that far.

1983
02:46:08,160 --> 02:46:09,720
Uh, Charles, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

1984
02:46:09,900 --> 02:46:10,760
Thank you, thank you.

1985
02:46:11,140 --> 02:46:12,700
Durs, thank you for the 100 bitties.

1986
02:46:12,900 --> 02:46:13,400
Thank you, thank you.

1987
02:46:13,460 --> 02:46:17,080
You see our poor Luna getting chased after by that Captain America?

1988
02:46:17,740 --> 02:46:20,800
And then you see me just standing still healing?

1989
02:46:21,420 --> 02:46:23,640
Yeah, this is why I don't play Luna anymore.

1990
02:46:24,500 --> 02:46:28,680
Why make it harder for myself if I can just do this to get to Celestia?

1991
02:46:31,760 --> 02:46:33,760
I understand now.

1992
02:46:44,720 --> 02:46:46,480
Yeah, I'm still standing.

1993
02:46:52,740 --> 02:46:56,600
There's no way they can shoot this.

1994
02:46:57,460 --> 02:46:59,180
The thing is, we can still lose.

1995
02:47:00,620 --> 02:47:01,740
Only because that...

1996
02:47:03,620 --> 02:47:05,640
Because they did cap it a little.

1997
02:47:06,660 --> 02:47:08,000
So it is loosable.

1998
02:47:09,200 --> 02:47:10,020
What the fuck?

1999
02:47:10,220 --> 02:47:11,420
How did he die?

2000
02:47:11,700 --> 02:47:16,640
I thought Arluna was healing the rock, the cap, not talking, Angela.

2001
02:47:17,160 --> 02:47:19,800
Sorry, it took three tries, but I got it eventually.

2002
02:47:21,060 --> 02:47:23,160
Eventually I'll get the right character.

2003
02:47:26,640 --> 02:47:29,500
Yeah, she built the same ult charge as me.

2004
02:47:30,100 --> 02:47:31,660
So it's like, how the fuck did Arluna?

2005
02:47:31,760 --> 02:47:48,480
like whoa whoa the perfect calendar fist i i did think i thought the luna would heal me when i dashed in front of her but i guess like i just don't have rights because i'm an animal

2006
02:47:51,940 --> 02:48:00,960
like which is understandable i i get that i get it i get it i get it i get it

2007
02:48:04,380 --> 02:48:07,280
Surprisingly, Iron Fist is like a counter to Rocket.

2008
02:48:08,300 --> 02:48:09,760
Only because they, uh...

2009
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,540
Oh my god, what is this team doing?

2010
02:48:17,440 --> 02:48:18,560
Okay, here we go.

2011
02:48:19,060 --> 02:48:21,840
We do have...

2012
02:48:21,840 --> 02:48:25,620
Because I don't know where that is going.

2013
02:48:25,720 --> 02:48:26,420
Oh there it is.

2014
02:48:27,420 --> 02:48:28,160
There you go.

2015
02:48:31,760 --> 02:48:32,300
Here you go.

2016
02:48:32,520 --> 02:48:33,400
I'll just chill here.

2017
02:48:34,060 --> 02:48:35,440
I live here now.

2018
02:48:37,020 --> 02:48:37,820
This is where I live.

2019
02:48:37,920 --> 02:48:38,660
You know what sucks?

2020
02:48:38,800 --> 02:48:40,880
I think the enemy team already used Puerto.

2021
02:48:41,700 --> 02:48:42,380
Oh, never mind.

2022
02:48:42,540 --> 02:48:43,320
That was our Puerto.

2023
02:48:45,200 --> 02:48:46,200
I mean...

2024
02:48:46,880 --> 02:48:48,220
I'm doing it.

2025
02:48:49,800 --> 02:48:50,320
Oh.

2026
02:48:50,800 --> 02:48:52,560
A little too late there, buddies.

2027
02:48:55,200 --> 02:48:57,800
I'm just gonna give it to the Angelo over there.

2028
02:48:59,460 --> 02:49:01,100
Just a little too late.

2029
02:49:02,080 --> 02:49:04,520
Oh my god, catch it, catch it.

2030
02:49:04,620 --> 02:49:05,260
Whoops, sorry.

2031
02:49:07,720 --> 02:49:07,740
Yay!

2032
02:49:08,860 --> 02:49:11,340
See, they don't know how to look up or down.

2033
02:49:11,800 --> 02:49:12,160
Who would...

2034
02:49:15,880 --> 02:49:16,320
Yay!

2035
02:49:17,660 --> 02:49:18,880
I feel so safe.

2036
02:49:19,020 --> 02:49:20,460
You see what our Luna had to go through?

2037
02:49:21,020 --> 02:49:22,660
And then you see where I had to go through?

2038
02:49:22,880 --> 02:49:23,260
Let me...

2039
02:49:24,860 --> 02:49:26,880
Let me show you the replay.

2040
02:49:27,440 --> 02:49:27,920
Final score.

2041
02:49:28,420 --> 02:49:29,820
One, two, zero.

2042
02:49:35,460 --> 02:49:37,100
You're like, I can't believe it, Doki.

2043
02:49:37,280 --> 02:49:38,140
You sold out.

2044
02:49:38,260 --> 02:49:40,340
You were our number one raccoon hater.

2045
02:49:40,540 --> 02:49:41,620
What happened to you?

2046
02:49:41,720 --> 02:49:43,680
I will show you what happened to me.

2047
02:49:50,660 --> 02:49:52,600
I will show you.

2048
02:49:54,780 --> 02:49:55,200
Yay!

2049
02:49:59,580 --> 02:50:01,340
And I got more healing.

2050
02:50:01,480 --> 02:50:02,560
Let's fucking go.

2051
02:50:03,880 --> 02:50:04,680
Alright, here we go.

2052
02:50:04,980 --> 02:50:07,260
There's a reason why I don't play this character anymore.

2053
02:50:07,560 --> 02:50:10,260
I know I keep saying it, but I need to give you more confirmation.

2054
02:50:11,180 --> 02:50:13,380
Because people always say, Doki, what happened?

2055
02:50:13,500 --> 02:50:14,420
Why are you on?

2056
02:50:15,140 --> 02:50:17,080
Why are you on this character?

2057
02:50:17,500 --> 02:50:17,980
Let me...

2058
02:50:20,140 --> 02:50:21,840
Let me show you why.

2059
02:50:22,740 --> 02:50:23,620
So you see me?

2060
02:50:24,520 --> 02:50:27,200
You see I'm just, like, having a good time.

2061
02:50:27,660 --> 02:50:30,340
And then our Luna is just dancing.

2062
02:50:31,140 --> 02:50:32,180
You see that?

2063
02:50:32,900 --> 02:50:34,880
Now, what is going on?

2064
02:50:34,980 --> 02:50:38,420
on the Luna side while all of this was going on.

2065
02:50:38,620 --> 02:50:40,080
Well, the way there it go.

2066
02:50:41,640 --> 02:50:42,380
The way there it go.

2067
02:50:42,600 --> 02:50:44,180
And now, all done.

2068
02:50:49,920 --> 02:50:52,040
And then what's going on on my side?

2069
02:50:52,880 --> 02:50:53,300
Yay.

2070
02:50:59,600 --> 02:51:00,160
Yay.

2071
02:51:03,380 --> 02:51:04,360
Oh, yeah.

2072
02:51:05,560 --> 02:51:25,720
all right how about like here what's going on on um the lunar side oh yeah look at that oh that looks that looks so fun and it's going on my side we

2073
02:51:37,720 --> 02:51:38,200
Yay!

2074
02:51:43,440 --> 02:51:44,480
Alright, let's see.

2075
02:51:44,720 --> 02:51:46,380
Okay, and then...

2076
02:51:47,540 --> 02:51:51,140
And then what was going on on Luna's side again?

2077
02:51:54,280 --> 02:51:55,460
Alright, look, he's happy.

2078
02:51:55,540 --> 02:51:57,200
Oh, there she is, look at that.

2079
02:52:03,400 --> 02:52:05,160
And what's going on on my end?

2080
02:52:05,820 --> 02:52:06,300
Weeeee!

2081
02:52:12,040 --> 02:52:14,780
Oh yeah, this is where I got my coroner.

2082
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:15,300
Yay!

2083
02:52:22,680 --> 02:52:29,080
So yeah, that's why I'm now a non-luna enjoyer.

2084
02:52:30,500 --> 02:52:32,620
Yeah, like, bro, there's nothing I could do.

2085
02:52:33,020 --> 02:52:34,980
I fucking try to heal her.

2086
02:52:38,940 --> 02:52:40,480
Hey, it's like a good thing.

2087
02:52:40,500 --> 02:53:35,220
the fuck down why would i get down i threw orbs at her that's all i could do what do you want me to do get down so i also die like my heels travel like i can travel to you it's not my fault it's just too much damage like maybe you should have positioned better i don't know maybe you should learn how to jump i or crawl walls it was just that easy maybe maybe you should have learned how to climb walls there was no there was no saving she had three people beating the shit out of her there was no saving that i saw what i saw three people were fucking pummeling her all i could do was watch

2088
02:53:43,360 --> 02:53:50,800
Maybe he should position better by a raccoon on a roof who tells me, yeah, like, why couldn't you get up?

2089
02:53:50,920 --> 02:53:56,720
You should have took my, you should have took my jump pack and then jumped to the roof and then we could have both been on the roof.

2090
02:53:58,180 --> 02:53:59,280
That's on you.

2091
02:54:02,620 --> 02:54:06,920
I don't know.

2092
02:54:15,240 --> 02:54:23,860
Oh, it's like that, what is this, like that lead game where, um, the one guy was like, What song was he singing?

2093
02:54:24,400 --> 02:54:29,960
He's singing a Maroon 5 song, and then it cuts his eyes like, and he's like,

2094
02:54:35,860 --> 02:54:39,080
And he's like, yeah, yeah,

2095
02:54:43,280 --> 02:54:44,940
and then it cuts to the, to the loot.

2096
02:54:50,960 --> 02:54:54,880
I'm just like Just on my high ground roof No

2097
02:55:02,100 --> 02:55:50,740
Any RPers Any RP enjoyers I love that video That's literally me playing rocket Versus like any other support I think it's also That's why I'm more chill now So I mean dive is crazy now like dive is like hard meta and like uh the reason why na got destroyed was because like na is so bad with dive and like because he can't do anything they're not used to playing against dive because like people in na don't fucking play dive but everyone in eu plays dive because all the fucking venom players are i think like all the best venom players are the best venom and are EU.

2098
02:55:51,540 --> 02:55:57,740
So, like, it's so easy to play dive for it's so easy to practice and play dive for them.

2099
02:55:58,140 --> 02:56:00,340
But in NA, everyone is like stationary.

2100
02:56:01,040 --> 02:56:07,980
Like, everyone's still, like, on they're on, like, what, Mag and Strange and Groot and shit.

2101
02:56:08,360 --> 02:56:09,900
So, like, no one's like, or Emma.

2102
02:56:10,080 --> 02:56:13,760
They still play, like, Mag, Emma, and Strange and stuff.

2103
02:56:14,120 --> 02:56:18,380
So, so it's so hard for people, for them to adjust to dive.

2104
02:56:18,700 --> 02:56:19,920
And it's not fun.

2105
02:56:20,120 --> 02:56:21,900
It's like, as a support player, it's not.

2106
02:56:22,100 --> 02:56:26,680
It's like the black back, the black, the back line is non-existent.

2107
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:31,860
Yeah, the best captain, no, it's actually crazy.

2108
02:56:32,080 --> 02:56:37,720
The best Captain America player in, in Marble Rivals isn't even American.

2109
02:56:39,500 --> 02:56:41,080
It's not even American.

2110
02:56:41,520 --> 02:56:44,640
I think it's like, it's either like, what, Nevix or Finzi?

2111
02:56:46,880 --> 02:56:47,740
Is that crazy?

2112
02:56:47,980 --> 02:56:50,840
The best of Captain America player is European.

2113
02:56:52,500 --> 02:56:52,900
Captain Europe.

2114
02:56:55,140 --> 02:56:58,940
You should get a team skin and then make Captain Europe.

2115
02:57:02,320 --> 02:57:02,880
That would be cool.

2116
02:57:02,980 --> 02:57:05,220
I think that's one thing I hope Marvel...

2117
02:57:05,220 --> 02:57:08,160
I don't actually know they can't do it because I don't think Marvel would let them do that.

2118
02:57:08,860 --> 02:57:17,460
It would have been cool like Overwatch where remember in OWL in Overwatch League, if a team wins the grand finals, you get to make a skin, basically.

2119
02:57:19,540 --> 02:57:20,500
for winning.

2120
02:57:21,060 --> 02:57:23,580
But I don't think, I don't think Marvel would allow that.

2121
02:57:23,740 --> 02:57:32,440
I think Marvel would be like, we are not letting you make OCs based off of, uh, like without our permission.

2122
02:57:36,450 --> 02:57:39,930
I heard like, because like Marvel is very protective of their property.

2123
02:57:45,140 --> 02:57:45,480
I don't know.

2124
02:57:45,600 --> 02:57:48,240
I don't know what Marvel would or wouldn't let you do.

2125
02:57:48,520 --> 02:57:52,320
Because I heard that like Marvel is like really hard to work with for licensing.

2126
02:57:52,520 --> 02:58:21,740
Because like, they're very very I can't obviously I can't say which brand told me but one I was trying to do a brand because like I was like oh do you think I could do like a I play Marvel rivals a lot do you think I could do like a collab or cross like a collab merch with Marvel rivals and then they're like oh um they were like oh um we can't do that because like Marvel is very hard to work with because they

2127
02:58:28,380 --> 02:59:09,200
that they like yeah they're and they're copyrighted they're like oh yeah no like we're not planning on working with Marvel in the future because like it was so difficult doing like a collab with them because they were so so like particular about like certain things oh were there weirdos in my chat I didn't even notice oh sorry here don't worry you want to dance don't worry i'll heal you did that heal you

2128
02:59:15,320 --> 03:00:28,440

I wasn't familiar with her game, King.

The right heroes could make all the difference.

All right.

2139
03:00:39,840 --> 03:00:40,260

We lived a silo.

2195
03:03:09,120 --> 03:03:10,580
We lived a silo.

2196
03:03:10,820 --> 03:03:11,500

03:03:11,800 --> 03:03:12,640

03:03:20,600 --> 03:03:21,940
Hey, hey buddy.

03:03:27,560 --> 03:03:28,820

03:03:45,540 --> 03:03:46,060
Big news.

2218
03:03:46,240 --> 03:03:47,700
I don't know where he heard that.

2219
03:03:48,240 --> 03:03:48,700
Big news.

2220
03:03:49,120 --> 03:03:49,440

2221
03:03:50,180 --> 03:03:52,280

2225
03:03:53,880 --> 03:03:54,580
Him is trolling.

2226
03:03:55,400 --> 03:03:56,160
Shoot him.

2227
03:03:57,640 --> 03:03:58,420
Oh, dude.

2228
03:03:58,640 --> 03:03:58,860
They're cute.

2229
03:03:59,340 --> 03:04:00,820
Why did you- Again, again, no one's shooting George.

2230
03:04:01,000 --> 03:04:02,520
Why did you say anything?

2231
03:04:02,640 --> 03:04:04,180
You didn't say you're not.

2232
03:04:04,280 --> 03:04:06,760
I know, because I am not a PDF guy.

2233
03:04:06,760 --> 03:04:08,160
Shoot him, shoot him, shoot him.

2234
03:04:08,220 --> 03:04:09,640
This guy, I'm going to HR.

2235
03:04:10,040 --> 03:04:11,760
This Zoom meeting is crazy.

2236
03:04:11,960 --> 03:04:13,800

I'm at four.

2245
03:04:23,760 --> 03:04:24,260
Run back.

2246
03:04:24,420 --> 03:04:24,620
We're good.

2247
03:04:24,960 --> 03:04:26,440

03:04:29,380 --> 03:04:29,560
Shoot Hulk.

2251
03:04:29,700 --> 03:04:30,540
I'm punching him.

2252
03:04:30,580 --> 03:04:31,000
Hit him.

2253
03:04:31,040 --> 03:04:31,700
Shoot him.

2254
03:04:31,800 --> 03:04:32,040
Shoot him.

2255
03:04:32,040 --> 03:04:32,680
Shoot him.

2256
03:04:32,760 --> 03:04:33,180
Keep going.

2257
03:04:33,280 --> 03:04:33,700
Keep going.

2258
03:04:34,000 --> 03:04:34,260
Keep going.

2259
03:04:34,520 --> 03:04:34,680
Keep going.

2260
03:04:35,640 --> 03:04:36,880
When do we stop?

2261
03:04:37,180 --> 03:04:37,740
All right.

2262
03:04:37,740 --> 03:04:40,300
I'm coming back.

2263
03:04:40,400 --> 03:04:40,820
I didn't see this guy.

2264
03:04:40,980 --> 03:04:41,220
I didn't see B.

2265
03:04:43,080 --> 03:04:44,600
When do we stop?

2266
03:04:45,900 --> 03:04:46,560
Hey, too.

2267
03:04:46,920 --> 03:04:48,560
This is real fire.

2268
03:04:48,560 --> 03:04:51,320
I think we're gonna kill him, right?

2269
03:04:52,140 --> 03:04:52,600
Yeah.

2270
03:04:52,900 --> 03:04:53,040
All right.

2271
03:04:53,220 --> 03:04:53,680
Shoot Groot.

2272
03:04:54,660 --> 03:04:55,340
I'm shooting.

2273
03:04:55,780 --> 03:04:56,280
No, we're not.

2274
03:04:57,580 --> 03:04:58,200
That's unlucky.

2275
03:04:58,220 --> 03:04:58,820
He's not siloed.

2276
03:04:59,040 --> 03:05:00,240
You're siloed right now.

2277
03:05:00,340 --> 03:05:00,760
We lost.

2278
03:05:01,300 --> 03:05:01,580
Here's siloed.

2279
03:05:01,720 --> 03:05:03,800
Call 3, 2, 1, go, go, go, go.

2280
03:05:03,920 --> 03:05:04,320

That's unlucky.

2282
03:05:07,020 --> 03:05:08,220
Heal me, heal me, heal me.

2283
03:05:09,060 --> 03:05:09,860

I'm healing.

2287
03:05:14,000 --> 03:05:16,060
I forgot about the siloed.

2288
03:05:16,600 --> 03:05:17,080
We got TB.

2289
03:05:17,320 --> 03:05:17,520
We got TB.

2290
03:05:17,720 --> 03:05:17,940
We got TB.

03:07:17,840 --> 03:07:19,160
Shoot them, shoot them, shoot them, shoot them, shoot them.

2335
03:07:20,320 --> 03:07:20,780
There you go.

2336
03:07:20,960 --> 03:07:23,320
This is real firepower.

2337
03:07:24,880 --> 03:07:25,640

It's fine.

2341
03:07:29,800 --> 03:07:30,640
They burned your ult.

2342
03:07:32,580 --> 03:07:35,780
It matters so much.

2343
03:07:35,900 --> 03:07:36,520
It matters so much.

2344
03:07:36,700 --> 03:07:38,680
It matters so much, guys.

2345
03:07:39,040 --> 03:07:42,260
I mean, we have no Super Gomez on my team.

2346
03:07:45,020 --> 03:07:45,780
I'm sorry.

2347
03:07:45,840 --> 03:07:47,340
I'll try to be Super Gomez.

2348
03:07:48,280 --> 03:07:49,420
What do you mean?

2349
03:07:54,660 --> 03:07:56,220

No, I'm the guy who recreated the Peterbot video inside of Sinatra's game.

Just because, like, I'm trying to test it.

2423
03:12:30,960 --> 03:12:32,040
Peterbot, Morton Marlborough.

2424
03:12:32,680 --> 03:12:33,960
No, I wish, though.

2425
03:12:34,100 --> 03:12:34,840
That would be pretty good.

2426
03:12:36,800 --> 03:12:38,980
Yeah, weird flex, but okay.

2427
03:12:40,380 --> 03:12:41,820
I've never played Storm, by the way.

2428
03:12:41,940 --> 03:12:43,960
I don't know how to play this character, so I'm just...

2429
03:12:43,960 --> 03:12:46,760
Stay low to the ground, alright.

2430
03:12:46,980 --> 03:12:48,000
Low to the ground, low to the ground.

2431
03:12:48,480 --> 03:12:49,920
He's learning, he's learning, everyone.

2432
03:12:49,940 --> 03:12:51,160
I got this to speed boost.

2433
03:12:51,240 --> 03:12:52,040
I'm pressing me.

2434
03:12:52,680 --> 03:12:53,160
I'm right-clicking.

2435
03:12:54,040 --> 03:12:55,460
Yeah, just right-click, left-click, right-click, right-click.

2436
03:12:55,460 --> 03:12:56,740
This is the best time to learn.

2437
03:12:56,740 --> 03:12:57,480
I want damage.

2438
03:12:57,680 --> 03:12:57,980
I want damage.

2439
03:12:57,980 --> 03:12:59,340
Wait, we're running triple support?

2440
03:13:02,180 --> 03:13:05,840
Oh my gosh, we had so many heals going in.

2441
03:13:05,840 --> 03:13:06,800
Help me, help me, help me.

2442
03:13:07,060 --> 03:13:08,600
Oh, we had so...

2443
03:13:08,600 --> 03:13:10,600
I'm backing, I'm backing, I'm swapping damage.

2444
03:13:11,100 --> 03:13:13,300
Yep, just say, remember to stay low on the ground.

2445
03:13:13,660 --> 03:13:15,980
How the fuck did they have a lot of damage?

2446
03:13:17,040 --> 03:13:18,220
Yeah, how is there a Jeff guy?

2447
03:13:19,100 --> 03:13:19,880
No one shot, bro.

2448
03:13:20,600 --> 03:13:21,200
So why are you peeking?

2449
03:13:21,520 --> 03:13:23,200
I'm backing us, I'm backing us.

2450
03:13:24,620 --> 03:13:26,380
Guys, this ain't looking so good.

2451
03:13:28,080 --> 03:13:29,960
This is looking a little rough.

2452
03:13:31,240 --> 03:13:31,360
Thanks.

2453
03:13:31,360 --> 03:13:32,880
How are we speeding us?

2454
03:13:33,720 --> 03:13:34,780
Okay, I had a look.

03:13:36,280 --> 03:13:37,840
Oh, guys, we're going yet.

2457
03:13:39,600 --> 03:13:40,480
Oh, yeah.

2458
03:13:44,860 --> 03:13:46,200
Okay, how do I do this?

2459
03:13:46,300 --> 03:13:46,800
How do I do this?

2460
03:13:46,960 --> 03:13:47,620
I'm pressing Q.

2461
03:13:48,060 --> 03:13:48,780
I'm pressing Q.

2462
03:13:49,180 --> 03:13:49,840

03:13:49,940 --> 03:13:51,080

03:13:52,860 --> 03:13:53,360
Got him?

2465
03:13:53,580 --> 03:13:54,440
He's doing it.

2466
03:13:57,140 --> 03:13:58,220

He can't have fun.

2568
03:22:08,720 --> 03:22:09,340
That's right.

2569
03:22:10,020 --> 03:22:12,440
I'm trying to be a successful small business owner.

2570
03:22:22,630 --> 03:22:24,470
Which hero do you think you want to be today?

2571
03:22:25,150 --> 03:22:26,310
Alright, I'll play a real support.

2572
03:22:26,830 --> 03:22:29,130
I'm not the type who fades quietly into the background.

2573
03:22:30,530 --> 03:22:31,370
Don't worry guys.

2574
03:22:31,930 --> 03:22:34,310
I will finally play a real support character.

2575
03:22:34,310 --> 03:23:03,360
oh wednesday nice for big bird yeah that works for me wednesday 9 p.m all right there you go i thought you were cool i was cool and then he messed with me why have i accidentally abandoned this a real support character wild oh shit widow maker on widow maker

2576
03:23:07,040 --> 03:23:29,480
I hope our one this one guy and our team actually plays a tank Oh, yeah, do you guys know the new like oh my gosh Okay, I don't know if it like abuses like you know, there's like collab What's it called when people like knock knock on other people stream and then they combine their viewership and shit What's that called?

2577
03:23:32,560 --> 03:24:35,840
For twitch share chat no not just share chat, but it's like share viewership too apparently people are like the new meta right now to get on the top of the yeah the stream together so the new meta right now to get on the top of the um the top of the the streamer um page for your game is that a bunch of people would just do a stream together but they won't be streaming together because they can they all combine their viewership that they will hit the top column um they'll hit like the top two columns where those who are sorting from high to low a lot of people doing that that's really smart it is but it's also like they're not actually streaming so i see like a bunch of like i see like a bunch of smaller streamers like the new meta like a bunch of smaller streamers they like basically just um combine their viewership together like six people will combine like six plus people um yeah it's a little loophole just a little loophole so like maybe they'll have like 50 viewers or like 100

2578
03:24:35,840 --> 03:24:40,100
viewers but when you add all of them together, it'll be like, you know, it'll be like a thousand or something.

2579
03:24:40,700 --> 03:24:43,180
It'll be at the top of the, the category.

2580
03:24:44,720 --> 03:24:50,280
I see it in rivals, but I don't know, I don't know if it's for other games as well, but I see it a lot in rivals.

2581
03:24:51,500 --> 03:24:54,380
The thing is stream together, you don't have to share your chat.

2582
03:24:54,740 --> 03:24:57,380
You can like turn that off, like turn that function off.

2583
03:25:00,860 --> 03:25:04,760
Like, I've seen people like, You can turn, I know like you can turn it off, so.

2584
03:25:05,620 --> 03:25:09,440
It's not an actual, like, you don't have to have share chat.

2585
03:25:10,280 --> 03:25:11,060
So it works out.

2586
03:25:16,020 --> 03:25:20,420
Or I have to give our, hello, some heals right there.

2587

Oh my god, I couldn't help him.

2591
03:25:34,140 --> 03:25:36,100
The shield doesn't help that.

2592
03:25:40,670 --> 03:25:41,370
Jesus Christ.

Oh no, I'm fucking dead.

2630
03:27:54,970 --> 03:27:55,330
I'm dead.

2631
03:27:58,130 --> 03:27:59,330
Oh, unless...

2632
03:27:59,330 --> 03:27:59,850

2633
03:28:00,310 --> 03:28:00,590

2635
03:28:07,970 --> 03:28:13,150
Guys, I don't feel good about the Mantis and Invisios.

2636
03:28:20,550 --> 03:28:21,710

03:32:02,280 --> 03:32:04,020
No, they're just...

2661
03:32:05,040 --> 03:32:07,560
They may or may not be just better.

2662
03:32:09,880 --> 03:32:10,540
That's it.

2663
03:32:10,780 --> 03:32:10,880
Don't worry.

2664
03:32:10,960 --> 03:32:11,500

03:32:17,140 --> 03:32:19,520
Oh, yeah, I forgot to go Luna.

2667
03:32:20,080 --> 03:32:20,080
Oops.

2668
03:32:20,880 --> 03:32:22,900
My whole plan was that I should be going Luna.

2669
03:32:23,760 --> 03:32:25,100
I forgot all about it.

2670
03:32:25,680 --> 03:32:27,020
Look, they just kept pushing, guys.

2671
03:32:27,440 --> 03:32:28,520
They just kept pushing.

2672
03:32:31,920 --> 03:32:33,980
No, I think they're just...

2673
03:32:33,980 --> 03:32:35,440
I think they're just better.

2674
03:32:36,980 --> 03:32:38,940
I think their team is just better than...

2675
03:32:39,020 --> 03:32:41,300
Seriously, I don't think there's a justification

2676
03:32:50,650 --> 03:32:53,870
It's just unfortunate they're built different

2677
03:33:06,050 --> 03:33:21,530
Oh, now we don't go at him come on guys Honestly, we just need more damage They're not going dive so I can play and you know Alright, this time We got it this time

2678
03:33:28,660 --> 03:33:43,700

2680
03:33:56,600 --> 03:33:57,300

Mantis duo here?

2682
03:33:59,700 --> 03:34:03,220

2684
03:34:06,480 --> 03:34:07,180

2685
03:34:07,860 --> 03:34:08,860

2686
03:34:12,610 --> 03:34:14,880
Guys, I don't know, guys.

2687
03:34:18,590 --> 03:34:21,290
Try my best to keep you up.

2688
03:34:21,910 --> 03:34:23,390
But I don't know anymore.

2689
03:34:26,070 --> 03:34:29,430
Oh my god, you're getting so much use.

2690
03:34:33,810 --> 03:34:34,510
Holy shit.

2691
03:34:34,910 --> 03:34:38,070

2697
03:34:55,110 --> 03:34:56,050

2701
03:35:03,230 --> 03:35:03,630
Oh.

2702
03:35:05,150 --> 03:35:07,470

2703
03:35:07,930 --> 03:35:09,370
And you know what they have?

2704
03:35:09,490 --> 03:35:11,310
A good old juicy atom.

2705
03:35:11,730 --> 03:35:12,190
Oh.

2706
03:35:12,910 --> 03:35:14,170

2714
03:35:22,250 --> 03:35:23,070
Born again.

2715
03:35:25,030 --> 03:35:25,290
Oh.

2716
03:35:28,990 --> 03:35:30,110
Who would have thought?

2717
03:35:30,450 --> 03:35:31,870
Who could have expected that?

2718
03:35:33,910 --> 03:35:36,350
Who could have expected a born again?

2719
03:35:38,970 --> 03:35:39,650
It's okay.

2720
03:35:39,850 --> 03:35:40,530
Wait, we win?

2721
03:35:41,270 --> 03:35:42,030
Wait, what is this?

2722
03:35:42,130 --> 03:35:43,630

2723
03:35:45,290 --> 03:35:46,390
Okay, guys.

2724
03:35:49,190 --> 03:35:49,910

03:35:50,670 --> 03:35:51,170
I've clapped.

2726
03:35:51,990 --> 03:35:53,050

Yeah, there's just one guy.

2730
03:36:02,350 --> 03:36:03,190
One guy.

2731
03:36:03,570 --> 03:36:03,650
Oh.

2732
03:36:07,750 --> 03:36:08,590
Ooh, oh, one.

2733
03:36:08,630 --> 03:36:09,790
Just one little guy.

2734
03:36:12,870 --> 03:36:15,890
I don't think I should have to use this.

2735
03:36:18,210 --> 03:36:20,170
There is a raccoon above us.

2736
03:36:21,230 --> 03:36:24,450
And he's using the greatest strat of them all, high ground.

2737
03:36:27,110 --> 03:36:52,490
point keep up the momentum it's just they don't have dive so i could just put a luna freely i could literally just heal where like nothing could kill me until they run at me that's like the only counter he just got oh oh my god there's no saving this man oh my god

2738
03:36:57,110 --> 03:36:59,390
It's just everything.

2739
03:36:59,830 --> 03:37:00,270
Oh!

2740
03:37:00,910 --> 03:37:01,710
Shit, I'm sorry!

2741
03:37:02,370 --> 03:37:03,610
There's nothing I can do!

2742
03:37:06,510 --> 03:37:06,790
Bro!

2743
03:37:08,030 --> 03:37:09,410
It's just all damage.

2744
03:37:12,090 --> 03:37:13,110
It's just all...

2745
03:37:13,710 --> 03:37:15,210
Nah, they don't know how to play that.

2746
03:37:15,510 --> 03:37:16,070
We're in NA.

2747
03:37:17,790 --> 03:37:18,710
We're in NA.

2748
03:37:18,910 --> 03:37:20,510
How the fuck would they know how to play that?

2749
03:37:22,290 --> 03:37:23,170
That's crazy.

2750
03:37:24,850 --> 03:37:26,270
Hey guys, I would...

2751
03:37:26,270 --> 03:37:26,490
Thank you.

2752
03:37:28,310 --> 03:37:28,770
Damn!

2753
03:37:31,570 --> 03:37:33,350
I knew they were, yeah, I had a feeling.

2754
03:37:33,570 --> 03:37:34,190
I can ult at the Luna.

2755
03:37:35,950 --> 03:37:37,250
I can ult at the Luna.

2756
03:37:42,470 --> 03:37:43,310
That's silly.

2757
03:37:43,550 --> 03:37:45,590
You think they're gonna know how to do that?

2758
03:37:46,270 --> 03:37:48,210
You know what region we're in.

2759
03:37:50,010 --> 03:37:51,050
When are they alting?

2760
03:37:51,570 --> 03:37:52,790
I'm still waiting for this.

2761
03:37:53,110 --> 03:37:53,150
Ugh.

2762
03:37:57,110 --> 03:37:58,150
I hit you, I hit you.

2763
03:37:58,890 --> 03:38:00,230
The assault, the assault.

2764
03:38:00,910 --> 03:38:01,850
Oh, that's unfortunate.

2765
03:38:04,130 --> 03:38:05,170
I know that's unfortunate.

2766
03:38:05,430 --> 03:38:06,770
There's nothing I can do.

2767
03:38:09,150 --> 03:38:09,630
I...

2768
03:38:09,630 --> 03:38:13,630
Better kick it out here if we're gonna save the tree.

2769
03:38:14,610 --> 03:38:16,150
Someone needs a snowball in the face.

2770
03:38:18,450 --> 03:38:19,510
Someone out got you.

2771
03:38:19,530 --> 03:38:20,870
You should have free bunny or someone else.

2772
03:38:23,350 --> 03:38:23,730
Alright.

2773
03:38:24,890 --> 03:38:25,370
I...

2774
03:38:28,200 --> 03:38:59,160
I wonder if like if one tricks like hate themselves you know like why would you do something to make your life more miserable you know like how could you just play i mean i guess mantis is not that i think it's not that man this is like okay fun but like you know when you're like when you've like played clearly mantis is not working you're still brute forcing mantis i'm just like thinking like Do you hate your life?

2775
03:39:00,540 --> 03:39:04,440
How does that work?

2776
03:39:05,720 --> 03:39:08,440
How much do you hate yourself to one-trick a character?

2777
03:39:10,420 --> 03:39:14,340
Yeah, I will play my one-trick and if I don't, I will die.

2778
03:39:15,440 --> 03:39:15,860
I'm just...

2779
03:39:15,860 --> 03:39:18,980
I'm out, I'm out, I'm so out.

2780
03:39:19,300 --> 03:39:20,640
Oh my god, I got stuck, I got stuck.

2781
03:39:21,220 --> 03:39:22,220
I got stuck on the cart.

2782
03:39:25,850 --> 03:39:27,350
Because the cart pushed me forward.

2783
03:39:29,530 --> 03:39:29,830
Sad.

2784
03:39:31,730 --> 03:39:33,190
I'm so upset.

2785
03:39:33,190 --> 03:39:33,450
I'm so upset.

2786
03:39:34,110 --> 03:39:35,590
Oh, I'm gigawalking.

2787
03:39:35,750 --> 03:39:36,330
Oh, yeah, I'm walking.

2788
03:39:39,770 --> 03:39:39,910
Oh.

2789
03:39:39,910 --> 03:39:44,330
I shouldn't use that.

2790
03:39:44,730 --> 03:39:45,210
Oh, I'm walking.

2791
03:39:48,530 --> 03:39:50,790
Yo, there is a atom here.

2792
03:39:53,570 --> 03:39:55,210
Yeah, I was gonna say, I shouldn't have altered that.

2793
03:39:55,370 --> 03:39:56,630
I freaked out.

2794
03:39:58,330 --> 03:39:59,110
No, I threw there.

2795
03:39:59,370 --> 03:40:00,130
I panicked.

2796
03:40:00,570 --> 03:40:02,570
Press from Reflex there.

2797
03:40:03,630 --> 03:40:06,570
It was really Reflex there from me doing that.

2798
03:40:07,230 --> 03:40:07,690
We're here.

2799
03:40:09,590 --> 03:40:13,070
We might lose that because I accidentally lost it.

2800
03:40:13,450 --> 03:40:14,230
Zoning out.

2801

Oh, we're walking?

2803
03:40:16,510 --> 03:40:16,750
Oh, never mind.

2804
03:40:16,930 --> 03:40:17,170
We're walking.

2805
03:40:17,970 --> 03:40:18,330
We win this.

2806
03:40:18,430 --> 03:40:18,730
We win this.

2807
03:40:20,090 --> 03:40:20,590
Back in.

2808
03:40:20,650 --> 03:40:21,210
Back in.

03:40:21,450 --> 03:40:21,630
Back in.

2811
03:40:21,630 --> 03:40:21,790
Back in.

2812
03:40:21,790 --> 03:40:21,910
Back in.

2813
03:40:22,490 --> 03:40:22,910
He's threat.

2814
03:40:23,010 --> 03:40:23,290
He's threat.

2815
03:40:23,350 --> 03:40:23,650
He's threat.

2816
03:40:25,150 --> 03:40:25,530
There we go.

2817
03:40:26,750 --> 03:40:28,330
Okay, now that's a zoning out.

2818
03:40:28,770 --> 03:40:29,790
That's a zoning out.

2819
03:40:30,570 --> 03:40:31,230
That's a zoning up.

2820
03:40:31,370 --> 03:40:32,950
That's a that's a double zoning up.

2821
03:40:34,510 --> 03:40:38,970
That's a There was no reason for us

2825
03:41:51,750 --> 03:41:56,090
A pro would get 100 kills.

2826
03:42:01,610 --> 03:42:05,530
100 kills or throw?

2827
03:42:07,730 --> 03:42:09,050

03:43:57,980 --> 03:43:58,300
Nice.

2843
03:43:59,200 --> 03:44:01,300
See, no, this is motivation, guys.

2844
03:44:02,700 --> 03:44:03,120
Motivation.

2845
03:44:06,960 --> 03:44:09,080
I'm just motivating him, chat.

2846
03:44:09,640 --> 03:44:12,940
Look at him, look, see, he's doing better now because of it.

2847
03:44:13,200 --> 03:44:13,920
Alright, let's all get in.

2848
03:44:14,020 --> 03:44:14,480
Let's all get in.

2849
03:44:14,540 --> 03:44:15,380
I have all, what do they have?

2850
03:44:15,500 --> 03:44:17,420
What do they use?

2851
03:44:17,420 --> 03:44:19,660
He's literally the only person talking.

2852
03:44:20,940 --> 03:44:22,160
He's talking to himself.

2853
03:44:22,320 --> 03:44:22,820
What do we have?

2854
03:44:23,180 --> 03:44:24,300
Oh, they have both supports.

2855
03:44:24,460 --> 03:44:25,180
Good job, guys.

2856
03:44:25,860 --> 03:44:27,040
Good job, guys.

2857
03:44:28,560 --> 03:44:29,280
You're right.

2858
03:44:29,380 --> 03:44:29,680
You're right.

2859
03:44:29,880 --> 03:44:30,140
He does.

2860
03:44:32,000 --> 03:44:32,660
You're right.

2861
03:44:32,840 --> 03:44:35,580
He does have double support up.

2862
03:44:36,060 --> 03:44:37,400
He's talking to himself.

2863
03:44:37,560 --> 03:44:38,600
The voice is in his head.

2864
03:44:39,340 --> 03:44:39,840
I'm 96.

2865
03:44:40,140 --> 03:44:41,440
This is not the best.

2866
03:44:42,600 --> 03:44:44,600
Because I need...

2867
03:44:44,600 --> 03:44:45,460
I'm 2% off.

2868
03:44:46,960 --> 03:44:48,360
Like, if he ugs, I'm fucked.

2869
03:44:50,600 --> 03:44:52,920
I don't trust my team to get off cart.

2870
03:44:53,180 --> 03:44:54,640
I hate that

2871
03:44:58,080 --> 03:45:03,520
Oh shit, he's giga walking Well, I can't get off

2872
03:45:07,940 --> 03:45:09,600
Are they still walking?

2873
03:45:10,100 --> 03:45:10,760
Oh shit they are

2874
03:45:19,200 --> 03:45:28,400
There you go, I didn't have to never mind you don't need to help me I'm oh this guy also he's raging he's raging There we go Oh, CC, I told you.

2875
03:45:28,440 --> 03:45:29,400
I can't leave for it.

2876
03:45:29,660 --> 03:45:31,320
This is literally my home now.

2877
03:45:32,520 --> 03:45:33,400
It's okay, guys.

2878
03:45:33,580 --> 03:45:34,360
They don't need me.

2879
03:45:35,820 --> 03:45:37,280
My flake is literally cosmetic.

2880
03:45:38,200 --> 03:45:39,100
You know, it should be...

2881
03:45:39,100 --> 03:45:39,540
It's okay.

2882
03:45:39,800 --> 03:45:41,020
I'm the passenger, princess.

2883
03:45:41,560 --> 03:45:42,960
I'm checking on that.

2884
03:45:43,020 --> 03:45:43,280
I'm checking.

2885
03:45:43,460 --> 03:45:43,660
I'm checking.

2886
03:45:43,800 --> 03:45:44,280
I don't think I died.

2887
03:45:44,320 --> 03:45:45,040
There you go.

2888
03:45:45,120 --> 03:45:45,320
Good.

2889
03:45:45,480 --> 03:45:46,800
We got closer to me.

2890
03:45:46,960 --> 03:45:47,540
We got...

2891
03:45:49,680 --> 03:45:52,180
He slowly just walked up to me.

2892
03:45:53,260 --> 03:45:53,820
That's good.

2893
03:45:53,880 --> 03:45:54,740
That's very helpful.

2894
03:45:55,480 --> 03:45:56,940
I was not leaving that cart.

2895
03:45:57,240 --> 03:45:59,580
I did it, my one jump.

2896
03:46:03,960 --> 03:46:05,160
I jumped.

2897
03:46:05,700 --> 03:46:10,530
Oh, they surrendered?

2898
03:46:11,810 --> 03:46:13,570
I got

2899
03:46:20,890 --> 03:46:21,390
off the guy.

2900
03:46:21,610 --> 03:46:22,750
I was like, wait, I jumped.

2901
03:46:22,990 --> 03:46:23,330
No.

2902
03:46:23,810 --> 03:46:29,790
I thought it was a C9 because I did one little jump.

2903
03:46:30,750 --> 03:46:32,890
Lyquist deserves a win.

2904
03:46:33,810 --> 03:46:36,250
We hate EU over here.

03:46:38,390 --> 03:46:43,120

03:48:35,930 --> 03:48:38,330

Oh, wait.

2923
03:48:38,750 --> 03:48:40,230
Is that the Widowmaker guy?

2924
03:48:41,110 --> 03:48:44,030
Is that the guy that was, like, talking to himself?

2925
03:48:44,590 --> 03:48:46,510
Talking to his the voices.

Like, you're right, guys.

2930
03:48:52,030 --> 03:48:53,150
They have a rock, you know.

03:48:53,570 --> 03:48:58,310
Like, no, the comms are good.

2932
03:48:58,450 --> 03:48:59,610
It's just funny.

2933
03:49:01,890 --> 03:49:04,630
Your voices told you what else they had.

2934
03:49:07,290 --> 03:49:16,810

How many... Okay, I'll do one...

2939
03:49:49,520 --> 03:49:50,400
Okay, we'll do LG.

2940
03:49:50,740 --> 03:49:52,440
LG and then we swap Swap the Street Fighter.

2941
03:49:53,900 --> 03:49:55,720
Back to our real main game.

2942
03:49:55,980 --> 03:49:59,300
See, I'm a good guy who occasionally- See, I'm a good guy.

2943
03:49:59,700 --> 03:50:02,080
This is my favorite pro- Alright.

2944
03:50:02,560 --> 03:50:03,920
Back to my hobby.

2945
03:50:09,320 --> 03:50:11,180
But never mind, I guess.

2946
03:50:13,440 --> 03:50:15,300
Which hero do you think you'll need to...

2947
03:50:15,300 --> 03:50:16,440
No, Rove, then...

2948
03:50:18,780 --> 03:50:19,840
Fucking Torch?

2949
03:50:20,160 --> 03:50:20,740
What are we?

2950
03:50:21,600 --> 03:50:22,440
Season 3?

2951
03:50:25,340 --> 03:50:28,040
I'm not the type who fades quietly into the background.

2952
03:50:28,500 --> 03:50:31,820
Now, who am I gonna vanish from this match?

2953
03:50:39,410 --> 03:50:39,830
Alright.

2954
03:50:45,210 --> 03:50:48,050
I'm surprised we're playing, um, Torch.

2955
03:50:48,290 --> 03:50:49,230
In this yellow?

2956
03:50:50,110 --> 03:50:52,210
Oh wait, no, specific... No, actually, it never...

2957
03:50:52,230 --> 03:51:24,310
mind in this yellow we definitely would play torch all right after this game we swapped the street fighter or we could do street fighter later okay i accidentally might have put uh we'll do it we'll do like i'm now 30 minutes to an hour street fighter that's fine yeah and it banned torch in this yellow where are we I don't know.

2958
03:51:24,410 --> 03:51:26,270
I don't know if I want to play Honda or Eve.

2959
03:51:26,690 --> 03:51:27,870
I just don't know.

2960
03:51:28,410 --> 03:51:32,770
I don't know what I want to do.

2961
03:51:33,290 --> 03:51:35,330
Okay, if they have dive, I'm getting off of Luna.

2962
03:51:39,090 --> 03:51:42,650
You see the Mecca's Zangief skin?

2963
03:51:43,210 --> 03:51:45,450
Nothing will ever be as good as vanilla Zangief.

2964
03:51:45,970 --> 03:51:48,750
I think his OG form was just peak Zangief.

2965
03:51:49,230 --> 03:51:50,290
You can't improve on.

2966
03:51:50,630 --> 03:51:52,210
You can't improve on what's perfect.

2967
03:51:52,230 --> 03:51:55,590
already and

2968
03:52:04,160 --> 03:52:21,530
when they start changing their zangif colors they're not real zangif mains why would you ever want to change how he looks like when he's perfect already yeah for his lord for my loyal fans this is not what the fans want

2969
03:52:29,850 --> 03:52:40,670
oh yeah when i tried zangif with the king mod it was not good like i i didn't know how to play the game And I did it for the tournament, right?

2970
03:52:40,770 --> 03:52:44,890
I was like, guys, I put on the mod for my tournament.

2971
03:52:45,210 --> 03:52:45,810
Like, on day...

2972
03:52:45,810 --> 03:52:47,070
Like, I didn't practice with it.

2973
03:52:47,130 --> 03:52:48,670
I was like, guys, it's gonna be so funny.

2974
03:52:49,090 --> 03:52:51,110
And then I did it on day one of the tournament.

2975
03:52:51,290 --> 03:52:54,410
And I was like, okay, guys, I think I gotta turn this mod off.

2976
03:52:56,430 --> 03:52:58,430
Yeah, I was like, guys, I didn't even test.

2977
03:52:58,510 --> 03:52:59,730
Okay, we're changing.

2978
03:52:59,870 --> 03:53:00,810
We're playing Nviz.

2979
03:53:02,050 --> 03:53:03,350
Okay, we're playing Nviz.

2980
03:53:04,670 --> 03:53:06,290
I've seen all I needed to see.

2981
03:53:08,330 --> 03:53:10,710
I've seen everything I need to see here.

2982
03:53:11,510 --> 03:53:12,090
This is that.

2983
03:53:12,870 --> 03:53:13,150
Yeah.

2984
03:53:13,710 --> 03:53:15,190
I'm playing Animal Crossing.

2985
03:53:18,750 --> 03:53:20,250
I've seen enough.

2986
03:53:23,990 --> 03:53:24,750
I've seen enough.

2987
03:53:24,830 --> 03:53:30,170
I might not be able to play this character, but I am not playing just against that.

2988
03:53:34,230 --> 03:53:36,230
Yeah, that's not happening.

2989
03:53:37,170 --> 03:53:38,090
We're not.

2990
03:53:39,730 --> 03:53:41,870
We're not getting dope tonight.

2991
03:53:43,610 --> 03:53:45,650
I think we're still going to get dope, though.

2992
03:53:46,750 --> 03:53:48,930
This is not, might not be, like, the best.

2993
03:53:49,750 --> 03:53:52,490
It's because I don't know, technically, I don't know how to play, Jeff.

2994
03:53:53,030 --> 03:53:53,770
Oh, shit.

2995
03:53:54,530 --> 03:53:55,470
Oh, shit.

2996
03:54:00,890 --> 03:54:02,330
It's not fair.

2997
03:54:02,710 --> 03:54:04,690
He gets, they get to dive.

2998
03:54:05,430 --> 03:54:08,110
I get whatever the fuck comp I got.

2999
03:54:09,930 --> 03:54:12,210
What kind of comp is this?

3000
03:54:15,490 --> 03:54:16,990
Because I wish I was rocket.

3001
03:54:21,110 --> 03:54:23,110
And I wish I was rocket.

3002
03:54:23,870 --> 03:54:27,150
It'd be so much nicer right now.

3003
03:54:30,090 --> 03:54:34,650
The thing is, I don't play Jeff enough to know what the fuck I'm doing.

3004
03:54:34,990 --> 03:54:36,790
We're like half-dived, too.

3005
03:54:36,790 --> 03:54:37,330
That's the thing.

3006
03:54:37,330 --> 03:54:38,330
God damn it.

3007
03:54:38,530 --> 03:54:39,250
That's the worst part.

3008
03:54:39,650 --> 03:54:40,990
Panther literally counters, Jeff.

3009
03:54:45,450 --> 03:54:47,970
And because we're playing Animal Crossing.

3010
03:54:57,090 --> 03:54:57,470
Alright.

3011
03:54:58,730 --> 03:54:59,990
Just swim away.

3012
03:55:01,010 --> 03:55:02,270
We have six alts.

3013
03:55:02,610 --> 03:55:04,410
Surely we could do something with that, right?

3014
03:55:05,750 --> 03:55:06,890
Just swim away.

3015
03:55:07,010 --> 03:55:07,730
Are you stupid?

3016
03:55:10,670 --> 03:55:12,370
It's just that easy.

3017
03:55:13,470 --> 03:55:14,050
Hey, guys.

3018
03:55:14,130 --> 03:55:16,190
Can we use, like, any of our own?

3019
03:55:16,210 --> 03:55:28,840
I'm too scared to use Oh my Oh my god Okay maybe

3020
03:55:34,860 --> 03:55:52,200
Oh my god Oh my god okay I wanted to get the The mantis but he went on the platform It's okay wait we win this Guys we did it

3021
03:55:55,500 --> 03:55:55,940
Planned.

3022
03:55:56,300 --> 03:55:57,240
It disoriented them.

3023
03:55:57,620 --> 03:55:59,040
My alt did it, guys.

3024
03:56:02,120 --> 03:56:04,940
My alt made them so confused, and I did that.

3025
03:56:08,600 --> 03:56:10,760
I want to break this, but whatever.

3026
03:56:12,440 --> 03:56:13,440
It was all me.

3027
03:56:19,720 --> 03:56:21,240
Look, guys, I know how to play.

3028
03:56:21,360 --> 03:56:22,740
I don't know how to play, Jeff.

3029
03:56:23,380 --> 03:56:26,660
But, like, if I play any other character, I'm not going to be alive.

3030
03:56:27,540 --> 03:57:01,120
only character that can live the longest on which is not very long which is the sad part i feel like i'm in eu right now hey yes oh hey oh nice you just yeah goodbye me and the raccoon having our own little adventure see guys i'm learning I didn't, because I don't know how.

3031
03:57:01,300 --> 03:57:03,580
I'm learning how to play Jeff in rank, guys.

3032
03:57:03,720 --> 03:57:06,640
It's not the best option, but that's what I always deal.

3033
03:57:10,000 --> 03:57:11,200
That's right, Jeff.

3034
03:57:11,520 --> 03:57:12,240
That's right, Hulk.

3035
03:57:12,460 --> 03:57:13,800
Can't smash me.

3036
03:57:16,380 --> 03:57:22,000
It's honestly not smart to learn this in rank, but that's how I learn every support, to be fair.

3037
03:57:27,400 --> 03:57:28,540
Oh, that's awkward.

3038
03:57:30,060 --> 03:57:31,640
Oh, that's awkward.

3039
03:57:36,270 --> 03:57:36,830
Nice.

3040
03:57:37,770 --> 03:57:38,570
They're real okay?

3041
03:57:38,890 --> 03:57:39,630
I think so.

3042
03:57:43,210 --> 03:57:44,390
He's fine, right?

3043
03:57:48,690 --> 03:57:49,810
Get it?

3044
03:57:49,870 --> 03:57:50,910
Oh, fuck.

3045
03:57:51,190 --> 03:57:51,850
Okay, that's my bad.

3046
03:57:55,460 --> 03:57:56,300
Oh, shit.

3047
03:57:56,580 --> 03:57:57,220
Oh, shit.

3048
03:57:57,600 --> 03:57:58,240
Hey, guys.

3049
03:58:05,160 --> 03:58:06,020
Wait, what?

3050
03:58:06,440 --> 03:58:07,300
Wait, he lived?

3051
03:58:07,380 --> 03:58:07,700
Oh, ha!

3052
03:58:10,240 --> 03:58:11,600
Oh shit.

3053
03:58:12,440 --> 03:58:13,000
Oh shit.

3054
03:58:15,780 --> 03:58:16,900
I'm learning.

3055
03:58:17,740 --> 03:58:19,460
I'm figuring it out live.

3056
03:58:20,360 --> 03:58:20,880
Oh my god.

3057
03:58:21,100 --> 03:58:22,220
Wait, I'm actually...

3058
03:58:22,220 --> 03:58:23,040
Wait, I'm carrying.

3059
03:58:26,360 --> 03:58:27,960
Oh my god, I got it.

3060
03:58:30,750 --> 03:58:32,850
I'm actually figuring it out.

3061
03:58:33,730 --> 03:58:34,490
The juice.

3062
03:58:35,210 --> 03:58:35,970
I did it.

3063
03:58:36,010 --> 03:58:37,690
I unlocked my third eye.

3064
03:58:38,370 --> 03:58:39,890
I unlocked my third.

3065
03:58:39,950 --> 03:58:41,050
Hi, bro.

3066
03:58:41,790 --> 03:58:42,270
Hi, Jeff.

3067
03:58:42,410 --> 03:58:43,810
I'm cooking right now.

3068
03:58:46,650 --> 03:58:49,570
The first zoning out, the second clutch out.

3069
03:58:49,810 --> 03:58:50,650
There you go.

3070
03:58:54,730 --> 03:58:55,770
That's right, guys.

3071
03:58:56,570 --> 03:58:57,090
Look at that.

3072
03:58:57,170 --> 03:58:58,750
Okay, I'll show you my Jeff hours.

3073
03:59:02,070 --> 03:59:04,590
I read this game.

3074
03:59:04,650 --> 03:59:08,490
I'll show you guys why this is a huge accomplishment.

3075
03:59:10,270 --> 03:59:11,390
I hate you.

3076
03:59:15,250 --> 03:59:27,010
When you're escaping and quickly look down Like this Oh like that Oh my god that's too much brainpower I can't make that natural

3077
03:59:31,130 --> 03:59:33,190
See this is how little I play Jeff

3078
03:59:38,130 --> 03:59:43,610
Oh just without jumping okay Wait, we're running triple.

3079
03:59:47,850 --> 03:59:49,570
We're doing it, guys.

3080
03:59:53,970 --> 03:59:54,910
Jesus Christ.

3081
03:59:55,070 --> 03:59:56,910
Yeah, they're not living.

3082
04:00:01,230 --> 04:00:03,670
Oh my god, I'm fucking slowly.

3083
04:00:04,050 --> 04:00:05,270
I'm swimming away.

3084
04:00:08,870 --> 04:00:09,830
Oh, shit.

3085
04:00:09,910 --> 04:00:10,710
Okay, we did it.

3086
04:00:11,390 --> 04:00:13,050
I don't know about Venom, though, but we did.

3087
04:00:13,070 --> 04:00:14,470
did it.

3088
04:00:14,870 --> 04:00:16,550
Oh my god, I just got here!

3089
04:00:17,430 --> 04:00:18,590
What happened?

3090
04:00:19,070 --> 04:00:20,250
What the fuck happened?

3091
04:00:22,090 --> 04:00:24,470
Bro, what?

3092
04:00:25,490 --> 04:00:27,790
Oh, now he swaps off.

3093
04:00:28,330 --> 04:00:29,430
Okay, Dylan.

3094
04:00:29,910 --> 04:00:33,910
Now you swap off fucking matches and, and ultra.

3095
04:00:39,020 --> 04:00:40,200
I hate that.

3096
04:00:40,360 --> 04:01:10,420
That's like one of my biggest pet peeves when like, one tricks, they don't swap off their one tricks on um against uh on your team but they swap it off when they're against you that's like one of my biggest pet peeves i don't know when to use this up honestly oh yes that's a lot of dead people right now oh okay i thought i was getting hit

3097
04:01:20,050 --> 04:01:21,450
Don't worry, guys.

3098
04:01:22,450 --> 04:01:23,950
Wait, they're not in dive anymore.

3099
04:01:24,590 --> 04:01:26,150
Wait, I can get off this fucking character.

3100
04:01:31,360 --> 04:01:32,320
Alright, guys.

3101
04:01:33,400 --> 04:01:34,380
We're gonna...

3102
04:01:35,300 --> 04:01:40,140
Either we're gonna die or this is gonna be clutch, guys.

3103
04:01:52,050 --> 04:01:53,670
At least I live.

3104
04:01:57,650 --> 04:01:59,250
Look, it's neither.

3105
04:01:59,490 --> 04:02:00,070
I lived.

3106
04:02:01,010 --> 04:02:02,050
Guys, I lived, though.

3107
04:02:02,350 --> 04:02:03,430
Okay, I'm alive.

3108
04:02:04,110 --> 04:02:04,690
Oh, God.

3109
04:02:06,550 --> 04:02:06,670
Oh, God.

3110
04:02:08,210 --> 04:02:08,730
Oh, God.

3111
04:02:10,930 --> 04:02:12,230
See, it's neither.

3112
04:02:15,550 --> 04:02:17,650
Okay, I gotta swap out because they're not in dive.

3113
04:02:17,790 --> 04:02:19,270
Technically, they're not in dive anymore.

3114
04:02:21,950 --> 04:02:22,870
Oh, shit.

3115
04:02:23,230 --> 04:02:24,150
Where am I?

3116
04:02:24,610 --> 04:02:25,650
Oh my god!

3117
04:02:27,250 --> 04:02:29,330
What the fuck is going on?

3118
04:02:30,050 --> 04:02:30,730

04:02:35,330 --> 04:02:37,430
Oh my god, they're punching me!

3121

04:02:41,890 --> 04:02:42,730
That's okay.

3123
04:02:43,270 --> 04:02:44,390
I spit on them.

3124
04:02:44,870 --> 04:02:50,790
Whatever happened to that girl after she did her fucking crypto scam?

3125
04:02:51,190 --> 04:02:51,990
Her crypto girl?

3126

Y'all just...

3139
04:04:01,220 --> 04:04:03,260
They could just do that, walk away from my ult.

3140
04:04:06,200 --> 04:04:07,320
That's crazy.

3141
04:04:08,020 --> 04:04:09,060
That should be illegal.

3142
04:04:09,520 --> 04:04:11,060
How could we be able to do that?

3143
04:04:13,320 --> 04:04:15,400
You could just fucking do that?

3144
04:04:16,300 --> 04:04:19,080
Oh, but when I walk away from my ult...

3145
04:04:21,940 --> 04:04:23,560
I still get caught.

3146
04:04:25,140 --> 04:04:26,260
How is that possible?

3147
04:04:29,020 --> 04:04:33,180
Hey guys, how come like we just let them do that?

3148
04:04:45,400 --> 04:04:47,680
Okay, there's nothing I could do for that.

3149
04:04:48,200 --> 04:04:48,700
I'm sorry.

3150
04:04:53,640 --> 04:04:54,200
Jesus Christ.

3152
04:04:59,500 --> 04:05:00,500

04:05:06,580 --> 04:05:08,240

High ground, who would have thought?

3160
04:05:29,740 --> 04:05:30,980
High ground equals win.
